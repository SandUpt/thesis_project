印度储备银行行长拉古兰·拉詹（Raghuram Rajan）最近呼吁发达经济体央行通过国际合作顾及新兴市场国家的利益。	Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has recently called for the advanced economies’ central banks to take emerging-market countries’ interests into account via international cooperation.
当然，这并没有使共产党不那么讨厌自由的媒体和欣欣向荣的文明社会，正是它们可以提供重要的信息反馈以确保任何国家的福址。	It has not helped, of course, that the Communist Party loathes a free press and a robust civil society, both of which are essential information feedback loops in ensuring any country’s well-being.
人和人格，以及他们彼此的感觉，能够让小规模的债务看起来如同无法维持，也能够让大规模债务在握手间烟消云散。	People and their personalities, and the way they perceive one another, can make small debts seem unserviceable or large debts disappear with a handshake.
当弗拉基米尔•普京作为俄罗斯的新科总统在2000年到达巴黎时，他所带去的是一个简单而令人欣慰的信息。	When he first arrived in Paris in 2000 as the newly elected President of Russia, Vladimir Putin had a simple and reassuring message to convey.
美国成功的另一个原因是它像磁石一样吸引着来自世界各地最优秀的人才，他们为美国版的全球熔炉贡献着自身的才智和力量。	Another reason for America’s success is that it has been a magnet for the best and brightest from around the world, who have contributed their own talents and energy to the melting pot of America’s narrative.
布鲁塞尔 - - 美国引人入胜的总统大选或许吸引了所有的头条新闻，但是欧洲也在进行一场领导权的斗争。	BRUSSELS – America’s riveting presidential election campaign may be garnering all the headlines, but a leadership struggle is also underway in Europe.
答案就在以下事实。 由美国及其他八个太平洋经济体政府（澳大利亚、文莱、智利、马来西亚、新西兰、秘鲁、新加坡和越南）提出的跨太平洋合作伙伴关系协定（TTP）的目标并不仅是贸易。	The answer lies in the fact that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), launched by Obama and the governments of eight other Pacific economies – Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam – is not just about trade.
）专家认同可以控制疾病的传播速度，但不同意能“彻底遏制 ” 。 承诺或暗示能把传染病挡在国门之外或一旦传入将被立即消灭的官员今后将面对公众的怒火。	Experts agree that pandemics can be slowed, but not “contained.” Officials who promise – or imply – that they can keep this pandemic from their borders, or stop it once it has arrived, are setting themselves up for public outrage later.
但大部分过度储蓄、支出不足的国家并没有减少储蓄、增加支出；它们的经常项目盈余一直在增加，加剧了全球需求的疲软，因而拖累增长。	But most countries that were over-saving and under-spending have not saved less and spent more; their current-account surpluses have been growing, aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth.
20世纪30年代，当开放社会的敌人们威胁到欧洲时，至少有一个强大的对抗模式存在于英国以及（特别是）美国，受到罗斯福新政的有力支持。	When the enemies of the open society were threatening Europe during the 1930s, there was at least a powerful counter model in Britain, and especially the US, bolstered by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.
如果它们无法快速行动起来重塑自己作为可信、高效的选民利益代表的形象，它们就有可能沦为政治背景，让不负责任的民粹主义逐渐占据中心舞台。	If they do not act fast to re-establish themselves as credible and effective representatives of voters’ interests, they risk fading into the political background, allowing irresponsible populists gradually to take center stage.
传递私人讯息的公告牌能够如此容易的占领公共空间是因为俄罗斯的公共空间几乎是闲置的：国家和社会之间的交流即便是有也少得可怜，而公共辩论则几乎没有。	The billboards with their private messages were able to occupy public space so easily because in Russia public space is virtually empty: there's very little, if any, communication between state and society, and barely any public debate.
在当前环境中，地缘政治紧张升级、信任缺失以及对关键性机构的不尊重所形成的累积效应可能带来一次重大冲击，也有可能只是令投资条件出现恶化。	In the current context, the cumulative effect of rising geopolitical tensions, loss of trust, and disrespect for key institutions could produce either a large shock or just deteriorating conditions for investment.
公司的思维（通常暗地里如此）是，通过污染环境实现TSR最大化是可以接受的，只要给CSR项目做一些贡献作为补偿 — — 就好像在恒河里洗一洗就能带走一个人的罪恶一样。	The thinking, mostly implicit, is that maximizing TSR by polluting the environment is acceptable as long as some compensating contributions are made to CSR initiatives – the corporate equivalent of bathing in the Ganges to wash away one’s sins.
海外印度人也依然心系故土，境外汇款总额不断增长，在2008~2009年间达到了464亿美元，其中大部分是来自那些在海湾地区打工的印度蓝领工人。	Indians abroad stayed loyal to India: remittances from overseas Indians remained robust, reaching $46.4 billion in 2008-2009, the bulk of which came from the mainly blue-collar Indian expatriate community in the Gulf countries.
但是这些技术还没有成形，而且我们不能单纯地等待市场来实现这些技术，因为它们要求公共政策上复杂的改变来确保它们安全可靠以及可以为大众所接受。	Yet the technologies are not yet ready, and we can’t simply wait for the market to deliver them, because they require complex changes in public policy to ensure that they are safe, reliable, and acceptable to the broad public.
穆尔西所采纳的列宁主义的“民主集中制”如果持续下去，将是对旧国家组织中的新一代人及其盟友的崛起的挑衅，这甚至会导致内战的代价。	The Leninist “democratic centralism” to which Morsi seemed to have subscribed, if maintained, will be a standing provocation to the new generations and their allies in the old state apparatus to rise up, even at the price of civil war.
它让我想起了1989年秋天布拉格温塞拉斯广场上回荡的键音 ― ― 后来这种声音响彻当时捷克斯洛伐克的其它地方。	It reminds me of the jingle of keys that rang out on Prague’s Wenceslas Square -- and later around the rest of what was then Czechoslovakia -- in the autumn of 1989.
但中国领导人必须认识到，中国面连着大规模福利损失，因此需要拿出接受短期增长放缓以换取更稳定的长期增长路径的意愿。	But China’s leaders must recognize that the country faces massive welfare losses, and thus should be willing to accept slower growth in the short term in exchange for a more stable long-term growth path.
虽然该组织只不过是将白俄罗斯、亚美尼亚、哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、乌兹别克斯坦以及俄罗斯间的双边军事协议强行堆砌在一起，而对此克林姆林宫当局依然感觉良好，安之若素。	For all this, the Kremlin is not in the least embarrassed by the fact that the CSTO is essentially a mechanical connection of bilateral military agreements between Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia.
随着国民政治冷淡程度达到了1930年代那段最黑暗时期以来的高点，欧洲屈服于破坏性民粹主义力量的风险也日渐增大。	With political disenchantment reaching levels not seen since the continent’s darkest times in the 1930s, the risk that Europe will succumb to the destructive forces of populism looms ever larger.
在1945年后的最初三十年间，起主导作用的是布雷顿森林共识 — — 一个允许决策者在关注国内的社会和就业需要的同时，能够使全球 贸易恢复和繁荣的肤浅的多边主义。	The first three decades after 1945 were governed by the Bretton Woods consensus – a shallow multilateralism that permitted policymakers to focus on domestic social and employment needs while enabling global trade to recover and flourish.
该条约由罗纳德·里根和苏共总书记米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫于1987年签署，要求双方销毁地面发射的弹道导弹和巡航导弹，而美国的撤出则标志着新一轮军备竞赛的开始。	Signed in 1987 by Ronald Reagan and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, the INF required both the US and Russia to eliminate ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles. The US withdrawal from it signals the start of a new arms race.
这些结果的任何一个都有悖于中国的战略利益；但和许多政府一样，中国领导人将避免短期的艰难决定，即使这会导致长期的不利结果。	Any of these outcomes would be inconsistent with Chinese strategic interests; but, like many governments, China’s leaders will seek to avoid difficult decisions in the short run, even if this results in damaging outcomes over time.
叙利亚人权观察组织（Syrian Observatory for Human Rights）估算，在过去四年中，近250,000人被杀，包括100,000多名平民，其中有许多是被本国政府以骇人听闻的方式杀害的。	The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that, over the last four years, nearly 250,000 people have been killed, including more than 100,000 civilians, many of whom were killed in horrific ways by their own government.
尽管签署了明斯克 II停火协议，乌克兰依然被俄国支持的分离主义分子所部分占领， 间歇性的战斗仍在进行中。	Ukraine remains under partial occupation by Russian-backed separatists, with intermittent fighting still taking place, despite the Minsk II ceasefire agreement.
除了升级制造业之外，发展中国家应准备好实现向服务业的转型，因为随着收入的增加这是不可避免的 （尽管准确时间很难预测 ） 。	Beyond upgrading manufacturing, developing countries should be preparing for the shift toward services that they will inevitably undergo as incomes rise (though the precise timing is hard to predict).
随着金砖国家在全球经济中的作用越来越大，大型拉美国家与金砖国家保持一致，寻求更大的国际影响力倒也无可厚非。	Given their growing role in the global economy, it is understandable that larger Latin American countries, along with the other BRICS, are seeking a more influential world role.
但特朗普本人的不靠谱承诺 — — 包括在英国和墨西哥之间建设一道墙以及让制造业岗位从海外回到美国 — — 仍令许多选民深信不疑。	Yet Trump’s own implausible promises – including his pledges to construct a wall between the US and Mexico and bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas – still seem credible to many voters.
部分归因于政府的刺激政策，自2008年以来中国增长更多地是由投资而不是消费推动的，这阻碍了世界急需的需求再平衡的进展。	Partly owing to government stimulus measures, China’s growth since 2008 has been driven more by investment than by consumption, which has impeded the economy’s much-needed demand rebalancing.
比如，看起来十分温和的抵制、撤资和制裁运动（Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions，BDS ） — —其许多支持者视其为合法的非暴力抵制 — — 一直在不断赢得进展。	For example, the seemingly benign Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, viewed by many of its supporters as a legitimate form of non-violent resistance, has continued to gain ground.
森林还是一座巨大的“碳沉淀池 ” ， 数百年来存储了巨量大气二氧化碳；因此，保护森林有助于遏制气候变化。	"Forests also serve as an enormous “carbon sink,"" storing atmospheric carbon dioxide for many decades or centuries; thus, protecting forests would help to mitigate climate change."
美国的经济危机所引发的严重的信贷紧缩加剧了美国经济的衰退，而越来越深重的衰退正在引发金融市场更大规模的损失，从而损害更广层面的经济。	America’s financial crisis has triggered a severe credit crunch that is making the US recession worse, while the deepening recession is leading to larger losses in financial markets – thus undermining the wider economy.
希腊经济正在崩溃，人道主义危机日益严重，若无法达成协议，其政府将别无选择，只能印钱提供基本社会服务。	Given Greece’s collapsing economy and growing humanitarian crisis, the government will have no choice, absent an agreement, but to print money to fund basic social services.
更加糟糕的是，选举中的落败者洛佩兹，似乎更愿意让整个国家陷入混乱之中，而不愿意接受按照宪法他已经失败的事实。	Worst of all, the election loser, López Obrador, seems willing to throw the country into turmoil rather than accept the constitutional legitimacy of his defeat.
比如，据说位于佛罗里达州的范祖尔（Fanjul）兄弟阿方索（Alfonso）和何塞（José）就向1月份特朗普的就职典礼捐赠了五十万美元。	For example, the Florida-based Fanjul brothers, Alfonso and José, reportedly contributed a half-million dollars to Trump’s January inauguration.
财政纪律不应该优先于包含在新协议内的重要结构改革，特别是改进退休金、法律制度、产品市场、公共行政和司法的措施。	Fiscal discipline should not take priority over the important structural reforms included in the new deal, particularly measures to overhaul pensions, the legal system, product markets, public administration, and the judiciary.
由于政府苦于预算不足和债务上升，高科技行业正在接受日益严格的监督，在这样的背景下的这样一则消息让我有些怀疑这个决定。	Coming at a time when the technology industry is under increasing scrutiny in the developed world as governments struggle with budget shortfalls and rising debt, this seems to me to be a questionable decision.
自首相安倍晋三于2012年12月重新执政并实施他的货��和财政刺激以及结构性改革计划以来，对日本人信心的影响可谓深远。	Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe assumed office in December 2012 and launched his program of monetary and fiscal stimulus and structural reform, the impact on Japanese confidence has been profound.
但和中国不同的是，印度的下降势头更为显著 — — 2011年第三季度GDP增速低于7%的临界点，而10月年度工业总产值实际下降了5.1 % 。	But unlike China, the downshift is more pronounced – GDP growth fell through the 7% threshold in the third calendar-year quarter of 2011, and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1% in October.
大体上看，马萨诸塞州或者俄亥俄州每出现1美元的GDP下降，所引发的税率变更和转移支付就将冲抵其中40美分，也因此起到有效的财政刺激作用。	Roughly speaking, each dollar of GDP decline in a state like Massachusetts or Ohio triggers changes in taxes and transfers that offset about 40 cents of that drop, providing a substantial fiscal stimulus.
同时，已经存在的安全事务机构 — — 欧安组织（OSCE ） 、 北约-俄罗斯理事会（NATO-Russia Council）以及欧洲-大西洋合作伙伴理事会（Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council）等等 — — 应该得到强化，而为此设置新机构则没有必要。	Security initiatives should therefore first be discussed bilaterally within the NATO-EU framework; only then should a common position be presented at the OSCE. Speaking to Russia with one voice is absolutely essential.
这一决定是为了让彼得森集团能够偿付对银行和普雷索尔债务。 在股票收购中，彼得森集团并没有付钱，而是赊账向普雷索尔进行了收购。	That decision was intended to allow the Petersen Group to service the debts to banks, and to Repsol itself, that it incurred with its share purchase, for which it made no initial payment.
人们曾经希望产品和金融市场的彻底融合会暴露哪些低效行业，把资金流从发展迟缓的国家转移到更加高效的使用者。	It was expected that full integration of product and financial markets would expose inefficiencies, steering investment flows away from laggards towards the more efficient countries.
然而，对猛虎解放组织的胜利，不一定要排除某种保证泰米尔人有一些政治发言权的地方分权形式，只要这种地方自治的程度不至于破坏斯里兰卡的国家统一。	Nevertheless, victory over the Tigers need not rule out some form of decentralization that guarantees the Tamils some political say, so long as a degree of local autonomy does not destroy Sri Lanka’s unity.
相反，战争在国家和非国家行动方之间展开，比如尼日利亚和博科圣地组织（Boko Haram）之间，或印度和纳萨尔（Naxalite）叛军之间。	Instead, wars are between states and non-state actors – between, say, Nigeria and Boko Haram, or between India and its Naxalite insurgents.
对于她那些挥舞着口红的拥趸们来说，佩林是一个朴实、虔诚的“冰球母亲 ” ， 她喜欢捕猎美洲驼鹿、信仰福音教义以及甚至有些混乱的家庭生活，都显示她是一个真实的并且典型的美国人。	To her legions of lipstick-waving fans on the right, Palin is a down-to-earth, God-fearing “hockey mom” whose moose hunting, evangelical faith, and even chaotic family life are all evidence that she is a real, typical American.
更近的例子则有1994年导致80万人死亡的卢旺达大屠杀，以及1995年斯雷布雷尼察地区数千名波斯尼亚男性遭屠杀的事件，当时许多人都发誓不会再让这类惨剧重演。	More recently, after a genocide that cost nearly 800,000 lives in Rwanda in 1994, and the slaughter of Bosnian men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995, many people vowed that such atrocities should never again be allowed to occur.
我们希望《2005国防评估》会着手解决这一问题，虽然它肯定会回答一些战略问题而将其他的留在日后商榷。	One hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue, although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate.
在世界范围内，可再生能源业的就业增长正在蓬勃发展，而（主要因为燃煤电厂关闭 ） ， 传统发电业的就业状况却正在萎缩。	Worldwide, job growth in the renewables industry is booming, while employment in traditional power generation is shrinking (primarily owing to the closure of coal plants).
《华尔街日报》当然也为特朗普的举动欢呼，但同样欢呼的还有《华盛顿邮报》的大卫·伊格纳修斯，后者声称“领导的道德因素”现在终于进入了特朗普的白宫。	The Wall Street Journal hailed Trump’s move, of course, but so did the Washington Post’s David Ignatius, who claimed that “the moral dimensions of leadership” had now found its way into the Trump White House.
比如，寻求吸引投资的政府，可能会将经济利益置于与居民需求同等的地位，从而降低企业环境标准或税收负担。	For example, a government seeking to attract investment might equate economic interests with residents’ needs, and thus lower environmental standards or tax burdens for businesses.
与此同时，特朗普政府采取了极端的、不合道德的反移民政策，比如最近收回的在南部的美墨边境上将移民儿童和他们的家庭分开的政策。	Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pursued extreme and morally unconscionable anti-immigration policies, such as the recently reversed policy of separating migrant children from their families at the southern border with Mexico.
希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯不久前也采纳了类似的论调，宣称“所有进步、民主和亲欧洲的力量都有义务携手并肩站在同一条历史战线上 。 ”	Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras recently adopted similar rhetoric, declaring that “all progressive, democratic, and pro-European forces have a duty to stand side by side on the same side of history.”
这正是好奇心之所以成为一种激情的原因：它不受道德约束，遵从自己的规则。 这也就是为什么社会坚持要以不同的方式来驯服它。	That is precisely what makes it a passion: it is amoral and follows its own laws, which is why society insists on taming it in various ways.
特别值得一提的是，这本书 — — 再加上一篇由高级政府官员匿名撰写的纽约时报评论文章 — — 展示了助手们为阻止一位冷漠、无知和偏执的总统因一时冲动而作出某些灾难性举动可以无所不为到何种程度。	In particular, the book – together with an anonymous New York Times op-ed by a senior administration official – showed how far aides would go to keep an incurious, ignorant, and paranoid president from impulsively doing something disastrous.
从伊斯兰高等教育到伊斯兰银行和宗教官僚机关，马哈蒂尔和安瓦尔偷走了PAS的宗教威望 — — 直到巫统开始分裂。	From Islamic higher education to Islamic banking to religious bureaucracy, Mahathir and Anwar stole the PAS’s religious thunder – that is, until the UMNO split.
地方政府往往更加关注基础设施、教育和住房等涉及地方层面的部分关切 — — 而这些领域并没有受到全球化的大规模影响。	It helps that subnational governments tend to be focused on more local-level concerns – such as infrastructure, education, and housing – that are not perceived as being strongly influenced by globalization.
有些人天真地相信牛吃的是草，现在才发现饲喂肉牛的食品种类繁多，从谷物到鱼肉、养鸡场的垃圾稻草（包括鸡的排泻物）以及屠宰场的下脚料。	People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal, chicken litter (complete with chicken droppings), and slaughterhouse waste.
欧洲远景的失落所造成的影响在2008年秋次贷危机和雷曼倒闭的过程中展露无遗，德国总理默克尔一开始的反应极为民族主义，而且是彻底反欧洲的。	The impact of this lost European perspective became clear in the autumn of 2008 when, in the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-European.
《人民日报》下属的极端民族主义报纸《环球时报》似乎认为，最近在西方发生的恐怖袭击是民主启示录的先兆。	The Global Times, an ultra-nationalist tabloid affiliated with the People’s Daily, seemed to suggest that recent terrorist attacks in the West were a harbinger of some kind of democratic apocalypse.
最后，尽管今天谈论金本位可能给金融市场带来的规范作用，可是金本位国家却经常暂停兑换，这意味着本国货币不能自由兑换成黄金。	Finally, for all the talk today of the discipline that the gold standard supposedly provided, countries that adhered to it regularly suspended convertibility – meaning that the domestic currency could no longer be converted freely into gold.
尽管这些谬误并未让我们质疑全球变暖确实正在发生，确实是人为所致，而且确实将带来很多麻烦，但这些对 IPCC 的质疑也造成了极大的损害。	Although none of these lapses provides any reason to doubt that global warming is real, is man-made, and will create problems for us, these challenges to the IPCC are taking their toll.
如果是后者，那么必须要问一问，这三个经济体中的一个乃至全部是否会与流行的预期相反，将在这个十年余下的时间里给我们一个惊喜？	If it is the latter, one must ask whether, contrary to prevailing expectations, new developments or shifts in any or all three of these economies might surprise us on the upside for the rest of the decade.
对朝鲜战争没有个人记忆或兴趣不大的新几代韩国人显然对美国在南韩对北韩的“阳光政策”中作梗的行为感到憎恶。	New generations of South Koreans, who have no personal recollections of – and perhaps only casual interest in – the Korean War, apparently resent what they regard as America’s undermining South Korea’s “sunshine policy” toward North Korea.
比如，欧元区需要真正的银行联盟（不仅要有共同监督，也要有共同存款保险和共同清算机制）和欧元债券（或类似的债务共同化机制 ） 。	For example, the monetary union needs a real banking union – including not just common supervision, but also common deposit insurance and a common resolution mechanism – and Eurobonds, or some similar vehicle for mutualizing debt.
监管机构学到的智慧是一旦出了什么问题最好赶紧表示“我们早跟你说过了 ” ， 并且偶尔发出些负面警告几乎也没什么坏处。	The received wisdom among regulators is that they are better off being able to say, “We told you so” if something goes wrong, and that there is little downside in occasionally issuing dark warnings.
我最喜欢举的例子是电子病历（我的妻子是医生 ） ， 其中存在着巨大���潜力去以提高美国医疗保健服务的效率。	My favorite example is electronic medical records (my wife is a doctor), which have tremendous potential to enhance the efficiency of health-care delivery in the US.
要点在于跨出你的舒适区，让你自己与周边和你差不多的声音保持距离，并且记住董事要为他们的决定的直接和间接后果负责。	The point is to step outside of one’s comfort zones, distance oneself from the voices around the table that sound just like one’s own, and remember that board members are responsible for the direct and indirect impact of their decisions.
但一些观察者已经看到一些迹象表明这次冲击将带来更大的后果，发达经济体将陷入令人沮丧的反常长期低增长轨道。	But some observers already saw signs that this shock would prove more consequential, with the advanced economies finding themselves locked into a frustrating and unusual long-term low-growth trajectory.
上述发现让科研人员可以选择取得疗效机率更大的患者进入到研究小组，同时避免让可能疗效不佳的患者出现副作用。	Such discoveries have enhanced researchers’ ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug, while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit.
联合国的各成员国现在如何应对—特别是那些相信联合国的使命和价值的国家—可以在解决其它更为广泛的现时地区冲突中助一臂之力，特别是在都支持真主党的伊朗和叙利亚的事务方面。	How member states respond now – especially those who believe in the purpose and value of the UN - may help shape the outcomes of other, wider ongoing regional conflicts, notably with Iran and Syria, both of which support Hezbollah.
我们决不因为保护主义和民族主义政治而降经济分比起来，而必须构建公民与领导人之间的新的社会契约，让所有人在国内获得足够的安全感，保持经济基本对世界开放。	Rather than closing off economies through protectionism and nationalist politics, we must forge a new social compact between citizens and their leaders, so that everyone feels secure enough at home to remain open to the world at large.
事实上，缺乏有勇气的领导人已经使国际社会针对当前埃博拉疫情的有效反应来得太迟，从而大大增加了这次危机所付出的代价。	Indeed, the dearth of bold leadership has already delayed an effective international response to the current Ebola outbreak for far too long, drastically increasing the costs of the crisis.
他启动了对养老金和高等教育方面一直久拖不决的重大改革，在介入科特迪瓦和利比亚事务也做出了正确的选择。	He has also launched a major and long-overdue reform of the pension system and higher education. He made the right choices in intervening in Côte d’Ivoire and Libya.
法德两国政府最近决定推动共同开发新型战斗机的计划当然算是迈出了良好的第一步，但不要因此寄望能在不久的将来看到任何明显的合作成果。	The French and German governments recently decided to move ahead on a plan jointly to develop a new fighter jet, which is certainly a good first step. But one should not expect to see any spectacular cooperative achievements in the immediate future.
计划可能会在 《福克斯新闻》甚至《纽约时报》专家中引来不错的反响，这些所谓的专家会摸着自己的下巴惋惜民主党人否决特朗普慷慨的基础设施计划。	The plan will be well-received at Fox News, and possibly even by pundits at The New York Times, who might stroke their chins and lament that the Democrats are rejecting Trump’s open hand on infrastructure.
而每年流向当今发展中国家的数额近2.5万亿，即第三世界国家人均每年会得到500美金。 对于那些现在的日收入不足2美金的人而言，这几乎是他们年收入的一半了。	And about $2.5 trillion annually would go to today’s developing countries every year, or $500 a year on average for each individual in the third world, almost half of whom now survive on less than $2 a day.
这一结果对那些熟悉日本银行危机的人来说无比熟悉：僵尸银行贷款给僵尸公司，反而把压力施加到了有活力的企业身上，扼杀了它们的成长。	The result will look familiar to aficionados of Japan’s banking crisis: zombie banks lending to zombie firms, which apply artificial pressure on viable firms, stifling their growth.
而这在一定程度上还是要归功于这位老独裁者。 由于在其死前恢复了国王胡安▪卡洛斯领导下的君主政治，弗朗哥给西班牙提供了一个重建的基础。	Here the old dictator can take some credit, for by re-establishing the monarchy under King Juan Carlos just before he died, Franco provided Spain with a foundation on which to build anew.
总而言之，新兴经济体遭遇的是由外部产生的宏观经济转变，非常规货币政策，大范围的市场波动以及发达市场缓慢增长所带来的挑战。	In short, emerging economies have been challenged by externally generated macroeconomic shifts, unconventional monetary policies, widespread volatility, and slow growth in developed markets.
但叙利亚依然可以实现和平改革，只要国际社会承认一味强调叙利亚的“复杂国情”对其民众不利，就能够影响到和平改革进程的走势。	Peaceful change in Syria can nonetheless be achieved, and the international community can influence that process by recognizing that its continued focus on the country's “complexity” does nothing for its people.
比如，它容忍世界增长最快的核武国家巴基斯坦，尽管用特朗普的话说，巴基斯坦“满嘴荒唐言 ” ， 包括为“我们在阿富汗追捕的恐怖分子提供安全港 。 ”	For example, it tolerates the world’s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal in Pakistan, even though that country, in Trump’s words, has “given us nothing but lies and deceit,” including providing a “safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.”
但国际货币基金组织（IMF）等金融机构现在正在反驳这一“自有资金”的概念，指出政府的风险越高，项目就越不能被定义为的“表外 ” 。	But financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund are now pushing back against this notion of “free money,” by pointing out that the higher the risk for a government, the less a project can be defined as “off-book.”
他们发现在这一时期，当国内企业所得税率高于其他经合组织国家时，企业利润增长的平均值就会超过了 GDP 增长。	They find that, during that period, average corporate-profit growth outpaced GDP growth whenever the domestic corporate-income-tax rate exceeded that of other OECD countries.
IMF是全球金融稳定的法定监护人，预警和预防失败的问题远比其对英国紧缩的看法严重得多，前者会导致极大的代价，并且这些代价往往会影响到无数人，特别是最脆弱群体。	Given that the IMF is the world’s anointed guardian of financial stability, its failure to warn and preempt constitutes a far more grievous lapse than its position on British austerity, with huge costs borne by many, especially the most vulnerable.
而且，即使在胚胎发育时期引起它们之间差异的刺激物早就不存在了，这些细胞的特征也在各自的细胞谱系中分别得到了遗传。	Moreover, the cells’ features are inherited in their respective cell lineages, even though the stimuli that triggered the differences between them during embryonic development are long gone.
上个月，一条从埃及向以色列和约旦输送天然气的管道发生爆炸 — — 这是穆巴拉克政权倒台以来的第15起类似事件 — — 至今没有修复使用。	Last month, a pipeline carrying Egyptian natural gas to Israel and Jordan was bombed – the 15th such attack since Mubarak’s regime was toppled – and remains out of commission.
2016年7月，东盟外交部长会议在联合公报中也没有提到两周前国际仲裁庭所做出的不利于中国的标志性裁决。	In July 2016, ASEAN foreign ministers failed to mention in their joint communiqué the landmark ruling against China that had been issued just two weeks before by an international arbitral tribunal on the disputes.
因此，G20对IMF指导方案的支持对于一个正在试图从金融危机中复苏、同时又在预防危机重演的世界来说并不明智。	So, the G-20’s endorsement of the Fund’s guidelines would not be wise for a world economy trying to recover from one financial crisis while preventing the next one.
采用这一方法，发展中国家可以实现动态增长，形成就业创造和贫困减少的良性循环，即使其总体基础设施和营商环境仍然有所欠缺。	With this approach, a developing country can grow dynamically, and create a virtuous circle of job creation and poverty reduction, even if its overall infrastructure and business environment are still lacking.
比如，国有企业或许可以将它们建立的私募股权资金挂牌，同时将它们投资的国内高科技企业粉饰为潜在挂牌对象。	For example, SOEs may be able to list private-equity funds that they establish, while grooming domestic high-tech firms in which they invest for potential listings of their own.
但现实是，帮助境况类似于巴西的国家正是IMF这样的全球金融机构能够起到建设性作用的领域。 应该指出，今天的IMF比十年前更加灵活和开放。	But the reality is that helping countries in situations like Brazil’s is an area where global financial institutions like the IMF – which, it should be noted, is more flexible and open today than it was a decade ago – can play a constructive role.
为了重塑美国的道德领导力，总统奥巴马必须兑现他曾经说过的话，真正给受压迫的人民带去曙光 — — 如他在就任总统早期在伊斯坦布尔和开罗说的那样。	In order to restore America’s moral leadership, President Barack Obama must make good on his early rhetoric – exemplified in his speeches in Istanbul and Cairo early in his presidency – which demonstrated genuine regard for the oppressed.
显然，多米诺效应并不会止于此处：银行A和银行B的破产可能会把银行C — — 甚至更多的银行 — — 拖入险境。	Obviously, the domino effect need not stop there: the insolvency of banks A and B could get a bank C – and additional banks – into trouble.
如果消费开支一路上涨，我们则希望各国央行提高利率，降低基建开支的热度，从而释放防止通货膨胀和短缺所需的资源。	If consumers go on a spending binge, we expect the world's central banks to raise interest rates to cool off construction spending and free up the resources needed to prevent shortage-inducing inflation.
以色列政府或许是抓住这次残酷谋杀作为借口挑衅哈马斯，促使后者做出可以让以色列反对来入侵和摧毁连通加沙和以色列的地道。	The Israeli government may have seized on the outrageous murders as a pretext for provoking Hamas into a response that would allow Israel, in turn, to invade and destroy the tunnels Hamas has dug from Gaza into Israel.
而特朗普的竞选搭档、印第安纳州州长麦克·彭斯（Mike Pence）2000至2012年间在众议院供职，与众议院议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）和其他共和党领导人关系甚密。	And Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, Governor of Indiana, served in the House from 2000 to 2012 and has close ties to Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders.
同样，美国2003年在伊拉克发动的为期三周的“震慑行动”战役以“胜利”告终，但却为占领者和普通的伊拉克人打开了地狱之门。	Likewise, America’s three-week “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “victory,” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
在加上奥地利、荷兰和未加入欧元区的北欧国家 — — 瑞士、瑞典、丹麦和挪威，北欧国家去年经常项目盈余总量为5110亿美元。	Together with the surpluses of Austria, the Netherlands, and most non-eurozone northern countries – namely, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway – northern Europe has run a current-account surplus of $511 billion over the last 12 months.
虽然富裕女性可以也确实付钱给贫困女性承担照顾工作，但也有很多人选择兼职或弹性工作以便履行子女的鼓励和教育职责。	Although wealthy women can and do buy the care work of poorer women, many also choose to work part-time or flexibly to provide the stimulation and education their children need.
但只要关注重点恰当，他们可以用少得多的资源大幅提高粮仓质量，避免超过30%的粮食 — — 往往靠近那些贫困的农村人口 — — 变质到不适合人类食用。	But, with the right focus and much more modest resources, they could dramatically improve the quality of grain silos where more than 30% of food – typically located close to the rural poor – spoils to the point of being unfit for human consumption.
美国总统奥巴马在去年 11 月的首次访华，以及他所表现出的那种卑微而有求于人的形象，更加强了这种当今和未来两大强权之间可能达成协议的印象。	President Barack Obama’s first visit to China last November, in which he accepted the role of pliant suitor at the court of the emperor, strengthened the impression of a deal between today’s great power and tomorrow’s.
尽管我们历尽艰辛为妇女赢得了不少权益，但对于这个她们 — — 以及她们的孩子的健康和发育的关键问题，我们仍然比计划落后了一百年。	Despite hard-won gains for women, we remain a century behind schedule on an issue that is key to their health and development – and to that of their children.
但它也有极限，越过了极限，对央行财务健全性的信心 — — 以及对货币可靠性的信心 — — 就会受到破坏。	But there are limits beyond which confidence in the financial integrity of central banks – and consequently the soundness of money – will be undermined.
中东地区的威胁是巨大的，并且还在上升，全世界的人都在担心极端主义斗士回国以及一直呆在国内的人受恐怖主义影响。	The threat to the region is large and growing, and it menaces people everywhere, as extremist fighters return home and still others who never left are inspired to do terrible things.
发自华盛顿 — — 虽然沙特驻美大使阿德尔·朱拜尔在美国宣称挫败的暗杀阴谋中毫发未伤，但如果这一行动的真正目标并不是朱拜尔，而是为了破坏伊朗总统内贾德的外交政策的话，那么策划者的目的或许已经实现了。	WASHINGTON, DC – Though Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir is alive and well in Washington, the plot to assassinate him may have succeeded – if its aim was not to kill al-Jubeir, but rather Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s foreign policy.
一个不祥的新词已经悄悄潜入生命科学和生物制药研究 ： “ 生物安全 ” （ biosecirity ） 。	An ominous new word has crept into the life sciences and biomedical research: “biosecurity.”
他们让伊斯兰国得以兴盛 — — 甚至助了伊斯兰国一臂之力 — — 并给全球秩序造成日益严重的威胁，在沙姆沙伊赫、贝鲁特和巴黎接连发生的恐怖袭击悲剧地证明了这一点。	They have enabled – indeed, fueled – the rise of the Islamic State, and with it a growing threat to the global order, as the successive terrorist attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Beirut, and Paris tragically have shown.
除非从现在开始，否则战火将会在政治和宗教的助长下蔓延 — — 受害者也决不会仅限于尼尼微（Nineveh ） 。	Unless we start now, the fires will spread – fanned by politics and religion – and it will not only be Nineveh that is consumed by them.
经济学家信心十足地反对商品补贴，因为农业和能源市场接近于完美竞争，需求端有大量消费者，供给端有大量生产者。	Economists feel confident in opposing commodity subsidies because agricultural and energy markets tend to approach the ideal of perfect competition, with a large number of consumers on the demand side and producers on the supply side.
而且认为不必政治解决叙利亚冲突就能实现上述目标是个严重的错误，伊斯兰国实现爆炸性增长恰恰是借助冲突。	And it is a grave mistake to think that this can be achieved without a political solution to the conflict in Syria – the conflict that enabled the organization’s explosive growth.
考虑到遏制气候变化影响的政治压力，聪明的投资者将密切关注可能导致需求下降的政策信号以及他们的资产财务搁浅的可能性。	Given the political pressure to mitigate the impact of climate change, smart investors will be watching closely for indications of policies that will lead to a drop in demand and the possibility that their assets will become financially stranded.
所幸的是，包括学生、主导民意者以及最主要的是律师在内的巴基斯坦人民挺身支持法官，他们在做本来应该由政党来做的工作。	Fortunately, the people of Pakistan – students, opinion makers, and, above all, lawyers – are standing up for the judges, doing the work that should have been done by political parties.
各国政府和国际货币基金组织这样的机构在努力保持可持续经济复苏、为全世界人民谋福利的过程中必须把这一点铭记在心。	Governments and institutions like the IMF must keep this in mind as they seek to ensure a durable economic recovery that will benefit all of the world's people.
他的左翼联盟党（Syriza）在1月的大选中大获全胜，随后希腊总理齐普拉斯任命瓦鲁法基斯领衔与希腊债权人进行如履薄冰的谈判。	Following an impressive election victory by his Syriza party in January, Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, appointed Varoufakis to lead the delicate negotiations with the country’s creditors.
巴勒斯坦人已经从美国总统奥巴马的特使乔治·米切尔处得到了承诺，保证以色列人不会在未来4个月的间接谈判中作出任何“挑衅行动 ” 。	Palestinians have been assured via a message from President Barack Obama, delivered by his special envoy George Mitchell, that the Israelis will not carry out any “provocations” during the coming four months of indirect negotiations.
有些人无疑已经背叛了政府，其中最具影响力的当属霍姆斯暴行达到高潮后不久，能源部副部长辞职并加入到反对派阵营。	To be sure, the authorities have suffered some defections, with the most significant coming soon after the violence in Homs reached its peak, when the deputy energy minister resigned and joined the opposition.
但是如果把这一问题仅仅丢给以色列和巴勒斯坦，那么巴勒斯坦在其1967年的边界内独立的目标将会遥不可及。	But if left to Israelis and Palestinians alone, the goal of Palestinian independence within the 1967 borders of Palestine will most likely remain out of reach.
在CAFTA的规则下，该协议一旦获得批准，80%从美国出口的货物将会免税，所有的关税都会在15年内取消。	Under CAFTA, 80% of US exports will be duty-free as soon as the treaty is ratified, and all tariffs will expire in 15 years.
我现在了解到，如果非洲想实现农业转型，非洲国家首先需要打消让农业部门落后的主要壁垒 — — 普遍存在的性别差距。	What I am now learning is that if Africa hopes to spark an agricultural transformation, countries will first need to remove one of the main barriers holding the sector back: a pervasive gender gap.
也许比特币投机客是下注于永远会找到流氓国家联盟允许使用匿名的比特币，甚至有朝鲜这样的国家会利用比特币。	Perhaps Bitcoin speculators are betting that there will always be a consortium of rogue states allowing anonymous Bitcoin usage, or even state actors such as North Korea that will exploit it.
事实上，在2001年后的十年中推动两位数增长的投资拉动型增长模式加剧了结构性弱点，目前已到了必须纠正的地步。	In fact, the investment-led growth model that facilitated double-digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses, which must now be addressed.
若我签署了引渡申请文件，其意义将是突破性的，因为它将首次向世人昭示，如果司法公正在本国不可能实现，涉嫌侵犯人权者可以在世界任何地方面临审判。	Signing the papers would be groundbreaking, as it would signal for the first time that suspected rights abusers might face trial anywhere in the world if justice was not likely at home.
就在1979年伊朗爆发伊斯兰革命之前没多久，一份美国中情局报告还将伊朗王朝比作“汪洋中不沉的海岛 ” 。	Just before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, a CIA report characterized the Iranian monarchy as an “island of stability.”
这样的目标有点像国家计划经济的遗留 — — 并与政策制定者把新重点放在市场的“决定性作用”背道而驰。	Such targets smack of the legacy of a state-directed economy – a legacy that runs counter to policymakers’ new emphasis on the “decisive role” of markets.
我们可以从这宗案件（和其他多宗类似案件）中推断的是他们是高度传统的农村社会半城市化的产物，在这样的社会中，人，特别是女人的角色是严格限制的。	From what we can surmise from this case – and many others like it – they are the semi-urbanized products of a highly conventional rural society where the roles of men, and especially women, are tightly regulated.
这些条款的真实意图是阻挠旨在保护美国本国经济和公民的卫生、环境、安全以及 — — 是的，甚至还有金融监管。	The real intent of these provisions is to impede health, environmental, safety, and, yes, even financial regulations meant to protect America’s own economy and citizens.
伊斯坦布尔—在不断向外扩张的大都市伊斯坦布尔有一个塔克西姆广场（Taksim Square ） ， 塔克西姆广场有一个小公园，它是市中心硕果仅存的几处绿色空间之一。	ISTANBUL – The small park in Taksim Square in the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul is one of the few green spaces left in the city center.
每一项研究都解释了绿色经济的一部份，没有一个能涵盖整体 — — 这不是因为这些研究有缺陷，只不过因为这件事已经完全超出了我们的能力之外。	Each of the studies describes a part of a green economy, but none can capture the whole – not because they are deficient, but because it is simply beyond our capability.
如果日本、美国和其他国家试图拦截或者回击朝鲜发射的导弹，那么，军事紧张局势 — — 甚至是可能的对抗 — — 就非常可能会接踵而来。	If Japan, the US, and others attempt to intercept or counter the missile, military tension – even possible combat – is likely to ensue.
2009—2012年希腊政府每季度支出攀升至135亿欧元左右的高峰，然后在2014—2015年下降至96亿美元左右。	Greek government spending per quarter climbed to a plateau of around €13.5 billion ($14.8 billion) in 2009-2012, before falling to roughly €9.6 billion in 2014-2015.
就在一个月前，南亚发生海啸，有关人员死亡、灾民受难以及各种基础设施遭受严重破坏的报道占据了此次海啸报道的主题。	Reports about the tsunamis that devastated Southeast Asia barely a month ago have understandably been dominated by tales of death, suffering, and the physical destruction of infrastructure.
因此即便欧盟体现了我们为确保欧洲在日渐艰难的时势中保持竞争力的良好愿望，它依然受到“为危机全球化推波助澜”的指责。	So, although the EU represents our best hope of ensuring that Europe is internationally competitive in today’s increasingly difficult environment, it is actually being blamed for globalization.
当然， 人们应当注意到，如果资源丰富的非洲经济改革进展得如同亚洲那样，那么，高涨的基本商品价格时代就将会推迟一个世纪。	Of course, it should be noted that if economic reform in resource-rich Africa had been proceeding at the same pace as in Asia, the era of soaring commodity prices might have been postponed for another century.
事实上，辅助性原则 — — 决策应该在尽可能地方的层面发生 — — 对于能良好运转的灵活的全球治理至关重要。	Indeed, the principle of subsidiarity – whereby decision-making should occur at the most local level possible – is crucial to flexible, functioning global governance.
然而除了勉强承认其关于喜马拉雅冰川的预测是“有悖事实”之外， IPCC 没有承认任何其他的错漏 — — 更遑论为此而道歉了。	Yet, aside from a grudging admission that its predictions about Himalayan glaciers were “poorly substantiated,” the IPCC has yet to acknowledge – much less apologize for – any of the lapses.
而肯尼亚无处不在的移动银行服务M-Pesa显然让贫困妇女能够从小农经济转向非农业经济，从而为最底层民众带来了显著收入增长。	Kenya’s ubiquitous mobile banking service M-Pesa appears to have enabled poor women to move out of subsistence agriculture into non-farm businesses, providing a significant bump up the income ladder at the very bottom.
尽管广泛利润分享计划表现出诸多好处，但只有三分之一的美国私营部门员工参与其中，并且只有大约20%持有本公司股票。	Despite the demonstrated benefits of broad-based profit-sharing programs, only about one-third of US private-sector workers participate in them, and about 20% own stock in their companies.
如果我们认识到创新来自理解地方情况和优化私人部门的巨量资源，我们就能确保未来更好的健康情况 — — 和更快的经济增长。	If we recognize that innovation stems from understanding local conditions and optimizing the vast resources of the private sector, we can ensure better health – and more rapid economic growth – far into the future.
2016年，发达国家应该同意接受每年总数接近100万的难民，方式可以是安置，也可以是提供人道、学生、劳工和其他签证。	In 2016, developed countries should agree to accept a combined total approaching a million refugees annually, either through resettlement or by issuing humanitarian, student, labor, and other visas.
由拉美人、东欧犹太人、意大利人、亚洲人、爱尔兰人和现在依然对牛津剑桥的双桨滑过查尔斯河河水魂牵梦绕的英裔美国人共同组成了伟大的美国民众。	In the United States, it is that great people composed of Latinos, Eastern European Jews, Italians, Asians, Irish, and, yes, Anglos still dreaming of Oxford-Cambridge sculls now cleaving the waters of the Charles River.
2010年以来房地产投资减少带来的负面影响比预期深远。 事实的确如此，几乎所有在8月下跌超过10%的各类进口项目都与房地产投资有关。	The negative impact of the fall in real-estate investment since 2010 has been deeper and longer than expected; indeed, almost all categories of imports that fell by 10% or more in August were related to real-estate investment.
与此同时，他们的行为 — — 以及其他银行家的类似行为 — — 却直接导致了住宅价格的上涨以及随后的毁灭性崩溃。	At the same time, their actions – and similar actions by other bankers – are directly responsible for both the run-up in housing prices and the damaging collapse that followed.
和这种个人化相关的大脑区域是从我们的贸易伙伴还是小型氏族团体成员的时候开始进化的。 在那样的情况下，违反道德的行为会被即时发现并加以纠正。	This personalization draws upon regions of the brain that evolved when our trading partners were members of small kin-based groups where moral violations were immediately identified and remedied.
这就解释了美国的房地产，纽约、伦敦和法兰克福的股票，世界各地的长期债券与人们认可的传统基本价值之间形成的巨大落差。	This explains the large gaps between current prices for real estate in the US, equities in New York, London, and Frankfurt, and long-term bonds everywhere and what one would conventionally think their fundamental values should be.
苏格兰微生物学家亚历山大·弗莱明（Alexander Fleming）发现能够杀死细菌的菌类后不久就认识到，过度使用抗生素会引起耐药性。	Not long after the Scottish microbiologist Alexander Fleming discovered a fungus that could kill bacteria, he recognized that overuse of antibiotics would encourage resistance.
如今，中国正意欲把核心利益一词用于与日本的钓鱼岛之争，甚至不顾危险地将它用于对整个南海的主张：事实上，一些军官已经在这么用了。	Now China is attempting to apply the same term to the Senkaku Islands in its dispute with Japan, and is perilously close to making the same claim for the entire South China Sea; indeed, some Chinese military officers already have.
纽约 — — 1945年广岛和长崎被毁标志着一个时代的结束和另一个时代的开始。 二战结束后冷战开始，世界小心翼翼地维护着摇摇欲坠的和平。	NEW YORK – The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 marked an end and a beginning. The close of the Second World War ushered in a Cold War, with a precarious peace based on the threat of mutually assured destruction.
正如萨默斯所警告的，坚持这样做只能在不可避免的失败前造成“不必要的痛苦 ” ， 让希腊（其实远不止希腊）崩溃。	Staying the course, as Summers warns, will lead only to “needless suffering” before that course inevitably collapses, bringing Greece – and much else –­ crashing down.
中国正处于结构转型中，必须警惕避免经济增长对既存增长源泉的削弱，以免掉入结构性陷阱造成结构转型成本过高，抵消转型的好处。	China is in the midst of that process, and it must be careful not to undermine existing sources of growth lest it fall into a structural trap where the cost of transition itself derails new gains.
简而言之，西方的对乌战略应该是在大选之前刺激该国经济，然后再与大选后建立的政府谈判建立一个改革方案。	In short, the Western strategy for Ukraine should be to stimulate the Ukrainian economy until the May election and then negotiate a package of reforms with the government that emerges.
我们面临的挑战是向年轻人证明我们很容易被恐怖分子的诉求所影响 — — 恐怖分子会告诉我们，有更好的办法让你的声音被听到，你可以通过更有意义的方式参与到世界中去。	The challenge is to show young people who are vulnerable to appeals from terrorists that there is a better path to having their voice heard, a more meaningful way to engage with the world.
随着21世纪的深入，大部分发达国家都将经历人口短缺，但美国是其中少数可能避免人口下降、维持其世界人口比例的国家之一。	Whereas most developed countries will experience a shortage of people as the century progresses, America is one of the few that may avoid demographic decline and maintain its share of world population.
因此即便企业更容易得到钱和贷款，许多公司依然不愿意大规模招人，因此害怕在未来经济下滑时要背上一张巨额工资单。	Hence, even if businesses get easier access to money and loans, many firms will still decline to hire on a large scale, fearing that they would be saddled with a large payroll in a future downturn.
伊朗觊觎核武器能力并且指使其什叶派代理人好战份子，不仅威胁以色列以及该地区，而且还在寻求僭取温和的逊尼派阿拉伯政权传统的巴勒斯坦人保护人的角色。	Iran not only threatens Israel (and the region) with its desire for a nuclear capability and its Shi’a proxy militants; it is also seeking to usurp the traditional role of moderate Sunni Arab regimes as the Palestinians’ defenders.
跟医学一样，经济学也被划分成许多不同的门类 — — 宏观经济学家一般不会关注金融经济学家或地产经济学家究竟在干什么，反之亦然。	Like medicine, economics has become highly compartmentalized – macroeconomists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real-estate economists study, and vice versa.
面对如此的现实，住在赫尔辛基的公务员Jiri Räsänen刚开始也同样感到沮丧，但随后他和他的朋友们想到了一个好主意：为什么不能在保留汽车的前提下，而只是更换发动机呢？	That fact at first depressed Jiri Räsänen, a civil servant in Helsinki – but then it gave him and his friends a good idea. Why not keep the cars but replace their engines?
美国石油生产商的补贴常常打着国家安全旗号；事实上 ， “ 先耗尽美国”的政策从长期看降低了能源自给率。	Subsidies to US oil producers have often been sold on national-security grounds; in fact, a policy to “drain America first” reduces self-sufficiency in the longer run.
美国对日本的出口几乎100％都是以美元计价的，意味着这些出口就像弗里德曼的版本一样是对美元有粘性的。	Almost 100% of US exports to Japan are priced in dollars, meaning that they, as in Friedman’s version, are sticky in dollars.
从根本上来说，它必须采用一个以规则为基础的机制来处理与两个邻国的关系，而也是中国政府对此患得患失的原因。	In essence, it would have to accept a rules-based system for its relations with its two neighbors, something of which China’s government has been wary.
它们的邻国中不乏深陷内部冲突或艰难转型者，国内不满情绪也在不断升级。 海湾国家急切地想平息革命浪潮。	With their neighbors embroiled in internal conflict or in the midst of difficult transitions, and with discontent rising at home, the Gulf states are eager to stem the tide of revolution.
而国会预算办公室则预计美国的财政赤字将在未来十年平均维持在GDP的5%左右，并因此导致政府债务占GDP的比例从2009年度的低于60%上升到90 % 。	The Congressional Budget Office projects that the country’s fiscal deficit will average 5% of GDP for the rest of the decade, driving government debt to 90% of GDP, from less than 60% of GDP in 2009.
但那些新一代马尔萨斯主义者反对将这些巨大的利益扩展到世界更多地方，因为他们认为全球变暖状况是如此恶劣以致必须去阻止增长。	The latter-day Malthusians are opposed to extending these tremendous benefits to more of the world because they believe that global warming will be so bad that it justifies stopping growth.
波兰、匈牙利和土耳其政府越来越极权，和巴尔干国家、中国和俄罗斯的领导人一样，它们越来越热衷于控制公共话题。	The governments of Poland, Hungary, and Turkey have become increasingly authoritarian and – like leaders in the Balkans, China, and Russia – increasingly eager to control public discourse.
食品价格通胀达到了两位数，人们对有多大比例的印度人生活在贫困线以下甚至贫困县应该划在什么水平争论不休。	Double-digit food-price inflation has been accompanied by debate about the share of Indians living below the poverty line, and, indeed, where the poverty line should be drawn.
20世纪90年代，发展中国家增长开始总体快于发达国家（用人均标准衡量 ） ， 这让很多人乐观地认为这两类国家的产出和收入将会趋于一致。	In the 1990s, developing economies, taken as a whole, began to grow faster than their advanced counterparts (in per capita terms), inspiring optimism that the two groups’ output and income would converge.
埃及前总统萨拉特对耶路撒冷的访问，以及以埃两国随后在美国戴维营达成的突破性成果，都是在双方前期私下取得谅解之后发生的。	The visit to Jerusalem of Egypt's then-President Anwar el-Sadat, and the ensuing Egypt-Israel breakthrough at Camp David, took place only after successful behind-the-scenes understandings.
而这个引发众多争议的提议 — — 其中最著名的倡议者是约翰•凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes ） — —要求为初级商品建立一个“缓冲库存 ” ， 当价格下跌时吸纳产品，反之则增加供应量。	This argument inspired proposals – most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 – to create “buffer stocks” for the main commodities, which would take supply off the market when prices fell, and add to supply when prices rose.
与此同时，2001年，利用美国专利商标局反应慢的弱点，Proctor对科罗拉多州16家小型种子公司提出侵犯专利权的诉讼。	Meanwhile, in 2001, taking advantage of the USPTO’s slow response, Proctor sued 16 small seed companies in Colorado for patent-infringement.
欧洲一体化就是多边全球主义实验的核心；随着法国与德国和解，欧洲这个自古以来冲突不断的地带成为了模范合作者的土地。	European integration was at the core of this experiment in multilateral globalism; with Franco-German reconciliation, Europe, a chronic conflict zone, became a region of exemplary cooperators.
事实上，自2008年初以来，平均年化真实消费支出增长只有1.3 % — —为有记录以来消费增长最萎靡的阶段。	In fact, since early 2008, annualized growth in real consumer expenditure has averaged a mere 1.3% – the most anemic period of consumption growth on record.
北京吸引了中国最顶尖的政治评论家，他们不喜欢讨论那些单调的宗教议题，而耶路撒冷的社会评论家则致力于解读那些将人们团结在一起的宗教。	Beijing attracts China’s leading political critics, while Jerusalem’s social critics argue for an interpretation of religion that holds people, rather than inanimate objects, sacred.
但自 20 世纪 90 年代起，后退速度有所回落，因为一些知名大冰川，如根戈德里冰川和锡亚琴冰川的后退 ， “ 在 2007~2009 年期间实际上已经处于停滞状态 。 ”	But the retreat slowed after the mid-1990’s until, for some of the biggest and best-known glaciers, such as Gangotri and Siachen, it had “practically come to a standstill during the period 2007-2009.”
根据新气候经济（New Climate Economy）计划的数据，到2030年全球基础设施投资将达到89万亿美元 — — 而要让这些投资变得低碳而高恢复力，必须在增加4.1万亿美元投资。	According to the New Climate Economy initiative, $89 trillion will be spent on global infrastructure investment by 2030 – with an additional $4.1 trillion needed to make it low-carbon and resilient.
欧洲是一个地理和历史的独特结合体，但是欧洲的边界 — — 以及它未来扩大的前景 — — 是由成员国的容纳能力和适应能力所决定的。	Europe is a peculiar combination of geography and history, but the boundaries of the EU – and thus the prospects for its further enlargement – are determined by its absorptive capacity and the adaptive abilities of candidate countries.
比方说我们可以通过重点研究各器官特性来加深对器官和组织包块或对肝脏、胰腺等器官脂肪浸润的理解，而避免把注意力放在全身的总体得分上。	We can understand more about organ and tissue masses, for example, or fatty infiltrations in individual organs like the liver and pancreas, by focusing on the nature of each body component, rather than by relying on an overall body score.
发自墨尔本 — — 许多年前，当我和太太开车载着三个年幼的女儿出行时，其中一个突然问了一句 ： “ 爸爸妈妈你们是希望我们聪明一点呢，还是快乐一点呢 ？ ”	MELBOURNE – Many years ago, my wife and I were driving somewhere with our three young daughters in the back, when one of them suddenly asked: “Would you rather that we were clever or that we were happy?”
2013年，增税、隔离程序要求的政府支出削减、政府临时关门以及有约束力的赤字上限可能要求政府进一步削减支出对经济产生了拖累。	The economy in 2013 was held back by tax increases, government spending cuts mandated by the sequester process, the temporary government shutdown, and the possibility that a binding debt ceiling would require further cuts in government outlays.
他希望德国能够脱离纳粹主义，纳粹主义能被摧毁的同时而德国不被摧毁，从而让这个伟大国家作为抵御苏联的桥头堡。	He hoped that Germany could be separated from Nazism, that Nazism could be destroyed without destroying Germany, thus preserving that great nation as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.
他甚至宣称为自己并未强制执行“红线 ” — —在2012年就叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德（Bashar al-Assad）的使用化学武器而划定的界限 — — 而感到自豪，因为无论国际法还是美国国会都不会批准实施干预。	He even claimed to be proud of not enforcing the “red line” he had drawn in 2012 regarding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, as neither international law nor the US Congress would have sanctioned intervention.
由于起领导作用的国家不能或者不愿 — — 究竟属于哪种情况已经很难搞清 — — 继续管理日益增加的资金流，导致布雷顿森林体系于20世纪70年代陷入崩溃。	The Bretton Woods regime collapsed in the 1970’s as a result of the inability or unwillingness – it is not entirely clear which – of leading governments to manage the growing tide of capital flows.
他们的关注点应该被聆听和讨论；有时禁止最好辅之以国民教育方面的新措施，比如强调移民并没有导致希腊的萧条。	Their concerns should be heard and debated; and sometimes banning is best combined with renewed efforts at civic education, emphasizing, for example, that immigrants did not cause Greece’s woes.
2003—2004年，日本财务省购买了大量美元，从而在日本银行不愿采取公开市场操作的情况下放松了货币条件。	From 2003 to 2004, the Japanese treasury purchased a large amount of dollars, thereby easing monetary conditions at a time when the BOJ was reluctant to pursue open market operations.
另一大复杂性叙利亚的少数派阿拉维派统治着占多数的逊尼派，这使得叙利亚成为什叶派伊朗在逊尼派阿拉伯世界中的代理。	Another is Alawite-minority rule in a Sunni-majority country, which makes Syria a proxy for Shia Iran in the Sunni Arab world.
此外欧洲还有很深的研究人才储备 — — 全球最顶尖的十家计算机科学研究所中有五家位于欧盟 — — 欧洲的创业繁荣看上去可以维持。	Add to that deep research talent – five of the top ten global computer science faculties are within the EU – and Europe’s start-up boom looks sustainable.
气候变化不是我们国家为了保持自然之美而必须克服的最令人生畏的挑战 — — 哥斯达黎加是每平方米生物多样性最好的国家之一。	Climate change is not the first daunting challenge our country – among the world’s most biodiverse countries per square meter – has had to overcome to preserve its natural beauty.
同时，在美国的财政系统中，国税要占总税收的三分之二，这意味着收入暂时下降的州可以自动且持续地获得净财政转移支持。	The recent collapse of those bubbles caused sharp downturns in economic activity and substantial increases in unemployment in both countries.
这部分是因为欧洲实行高税收，任何人对此都无能为力：如果人们认为自己拿回家的报酬太低，而边际税率太高，没有人能强迫他们去工作。	This is partly due to higher taxes in Europe, and this cannot be undone: nobody can force someone to work if they consider their take-home pay too low because of a high marginal tax rate.
前总统克林顿曾说他为未能充分应对1994年卢旺达爆发的种族灭绝危机而感到遗憾，尽管应该遗憾的人还有很多。	Former President Bill Clinton has said that he regrets his failure to respond adequately to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, although he was not alone.
与此同时，法国和荷兰民众的声音也不应该被忽视，尤其是因为在它们中随便哪一个国家就同一个文本进行二次全民公决都是不可想象的事情。	At the same time, French and Dutch citizens’ voices cannot be ignored – all the more so because it is unimaginable that an identical text could be submitted to a second referendum in either country.
罗姆尼最近承认了这一点，承认“财政断崖 ” — —布什时代的税收减免将于今年年底前结束，再加上已经预定实施的大规模开支削减计划 — — 将联合起来把经济推入衰退。	Romney conceded this point recently, acknowledging that the “fiscal cliff” – the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts at the end of this year, combined with large spending cuts already scheduled to take effect – would push the economy back into recession.
在这一不确定性面前，企业部门在风险最高、资本最密集的投资已经完成之前，或在出现清晰的系统性信号之前是不会进入市场的。	In the face of such uncertainty, the business sector will not enter the market until the riskiest and most capital-intensive investments have been made, or until coherent and systematic political signals have been communicated.
对日本来说，这将是沉重一击，而如果特朗普兑现竞选承诺，要求日本和韩国等盟国增加自身防御的“保护费”日本的损失还会更大。	That will be a big loss for Japan, and the country will lose out even more if Trump follows through on his campaign promise to make allies such as Japan and South Korea pay more for their own defense.
这些新的威胁，正如在‘第三帝国’统治下那样对人类生命表现出同样的蔑视并对建立一种对全世界的独裁表现出同样的渴望 。 ”	These new threats, just as under the Third Reich, show the same contempt for human life and the same aspiration to establish an exclusive dictate over the world.”
但由于预期会因应央行行为做出调整，所以自由裁量的货币政策其实是无效的 — — 只会产生较高的通胀率却缺乏产出或就业增长。	But, because expectations adjust to central bank behavior, discretionary monetary policy is futile: it yields higher inflation but no output or employment increases.
由于许多经济部门缺乏竞争力且教育体系不完善，沙特人口 — — 其中70%不到35岁 — — 将在今后几年经历爆发式失业潮。	Given many economic sectors’ lack of competitiveness and the inadequacy of the educational system, the Saudi population – 70% of which is under 35 years old – will experience skyrocketing unemployment in the coming years.
最近几年，扩大疫苗项目进展迅速，这一信息代表了全球社会的独特机会，特别是在我们即将彻底消灭小儿麻痹症时。	Given the progress made in expanding vaccination programs in recent years, this revelation represents a unique opportunity for the global community, particularly as we begin to close the lid on polio.
所有这些都表明，要么是大选后的跛脚鸭国会会议上，要么在新国会产生后的最初几个月，美国政客可能会消除财政悬崖。	All of this suggests that, whether in the lame-duck congressional session following the elections or in the first few months of the new Congress, US politicians will likely dismantle the fiscal cliff.
为支持经济增长和发展，我们需要发掘所有劳动者的潜力，不仅授予女性赚钱的机会，而且要让她们担负起领导职责。	To support economic growth and development, we need to tap the potential of all workers, giving women opportunities not just to earn, but also to lead.
出席就职典礼的人数 — — 远远少于特朗普愿意相信的规模 — — 可以从现成的证据（包括国家广场的照片和地铁乘客人数等）很容易地推断。	The number of people who attended the inauguration – far less than Trump wanted to believe – could easily be inferred from the available evidence (including photographs of the National Mall and the number of subway riders).
流言通过社交媒体传播，特别是WhatsApp，这导致无辜的人因为被控宰牛、绑架儿童或更恶劣的行为而被暴民处以私刑。	Rumors forwarded via social media, especially on WhatsApp, have led to mob lynchings of innocent people falsely accused of being cow slaughterers, child kidnappers, or worse.
这是因为，最初的平静时期常常以腐败堕落滋生以及革命目标的倒退为标志，导致理想主义者感到革命失去了方向。	This is because the initial quiet period is often marked by corruption and a retreat from revolutionary goals, leading idealists to feel that the revolution is losing its way.
杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）和沃尔特·白芝浩（Walter Bagehot）就是反对派阵营中的两大巨头。	Two notable holdouts are Jamie Dimon and Walter Bagehot.
在经过多年徒劳地试图和平解决争端，以及十几次根据谈判者的部署而推出的官方以及不公开渠道的和平计划后，能够创造性地达成协议的空间已经非常小了。	After years of frustrated attempts to reach a settlement, and with dozens of official and back-channel peace plans at the negotiators’ disposal, there remains little room for creativity in producing an agreement.
更为引人注目的模式是美国人对实际流动性较低的部分地区 — — 包括乔治亚，阿拉巴马，弗吉尼亚，北卡罗来纳和南卡罗来纳等东南部各州 — — 的社会流动性过于乐观。	An even more striking pattern is that Americans are overly optimistic about social mobility in parts of the country where actual mobility is low – including the southeastern states of Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
说到底，AI的未来（future of AI ） — —我们的AI未来（AI future ） — —是光明的。	Ultimately, the future of AI – our AI future – is bright.
加尔布雷斯观察到，占款私用（embezzlement）有一种性质，即“罪行犯下和发现之间会有几周、几个月或几年的时滞。	Embezzlement, Galbraith observed, has the property that “weeks, months, or years elapse between the commission of the crime and its discovery.
相反，俄罗斯是更典型的民族安全国家（National Security State ） ， 撩拨西方的焦虑以巩固其对乌克兰的控制，以官方民族主义镇压国内反对者。	Russia, by contrast, is a more classic National Security State, now playing Western anxieties like a fiddle to consolidate its tightening grip on Ukraine and suppress domestic opposition with a tide of official nationalism.
在这样的背景下，很难解释为何欧洲央行要继续坚持非常规货币政策措施 — — 比如负利率和不断地购买债券。	Against this background, it is difficult to explain why the ECB continues to insist that unconventional monetary-policy measures – such as negative rates and continued bond purchases – are needed.
我们只不过尚未具备足够的深刻洞察力去理解在一场遥远的变革 — — 不管是一场金融危机还是爆发式增长 — — 中所有的因素将如何互动。	We simply do not yet have sufficiently precise insights into how all of its elements interact during times of far-reaching change, whether it be a financial crisis or a growth spurt.
卡尔加里—当哈维·库欣（Harvey Cushing）和威廉·博威（William Bovie）于1926年引入电灼（用高频电流封闭血管或制造切口 ） ， 他们的创新改变了神经外科学。	CALGARY – When Harvey Cushing and William Bovie introduced electrocautery (which uses a high-frequency current to seal blood vessels or make incisions) in 1926, their innovation transformed neurosurgery.
1989年，在爱沙尼亚之旅中（当时爱沙尼亚仍是苏联的一部分 ） ， 我要的翻译 — — 一位兼职牙医带我去她的牙科诊所。	In 1989, during a trip to Estonia – then still a part of the Soviet Union – I asked my interpreter, a moonlighting dentist, to take me to her dental clinic.
我们不知道下一场危机何时发生，在哪里发生，但我们能知道它会发生 — — 并且我们必须在它发生时做出更好的准备。	We do not know when and where the next crisis will erupt, but we do know that it will – and that we must be better prepared when it does.
因此 ， 《 利维坦》由俄罗斯文化部拨出部分资金 — — 并且表示俄罗斯当局对赢得奥斯卡奖不感兴趣 — — 显得颇为讽刺。	So it is ironic that Leviathan was partly financed by Russia's culture ministry – and telling that the Russian authorities had no interest in its winning at the Oscars.
比如，如果实际发生在2012年初的伦敦鲸交易发生在2008年金融系统孱弱不堪时，JPM就会被网开一面。	The London Whale trades, for example, were from early 2012; had they occurred in 2008, when the financial system was fragile, JPM, it is said, would have gotten a legal pass.
我会尽快派遣一支欧洲开放社会计划需求评估团队到希腊与当局（及已经在帮助需要者的民众和组织）联系，以便制定一项能争取公众支持的计划。	As soon as possible, I will dispatch an OSIFE needs-assessment team to Greece to contact the authorities – and the people and organizations already helping the needy – to work out a plan for which we can generate public support.
毕竟，这项政策不是由国土安全部门制定的，而是由特朗普的首席战略顾问、自命为文化斗士的史蒂芬·班农（Stephen Bannon）制定的。	After all, the policy was designed not by the domestic security establishment, but by Trump’s chief strategist, the avowed culture warrior Stephen Bannon.
诺贝尔奖获得者、农学家布劳格（Norman Borlaug）用公共资金开发的新的“绿色革命”种子可以被世界各地的使用者免费获得。	The new “Green Revolution” seeds that the Nobel laureate agronomist Norman Borlaug developed with public money were freely available to all users anywhere.
我们的方法II的理性总是能够指向每个理性的个人都会同意的最优选择的��蒙观点，和多数 合理 选择这一广泛接受的现代观点相冲突。	The Enlightenment idea that our System-II rationality can always point to an optimal choice about which every reasonable individual would agree clashes with the widely accepted modern idea that there is a plurality of reasonable choices.
事实上，就在上周，福克斯新闻主播比尔·奥莱利尽管拥有美国最受欢迎的有线电视真人秀，但却依然失去了工作。 因为广告商面对团结一致的民众压力而迅速抛弃了他。	Indeed, just last week, the Fox News host Bill O’Reilly lost his job, despite having America’s most popular cable news show, when advertisers, facing concerted grassroots pressure, quickly deserted him.
最有效的征税方法之一是美国工资税，该税种的边际税率接近于平均税率（因为不存在减税，税率结构的累进性也较低 ） 。	One of the most efficient tax-raising methods is the US payroll tax, for which the marginal tax rate is close to the average rate (because deductions are absent and there is little graduation in the rate structure).
这就要求人们更加深入地理解技术驱动的结构变化，科技巨头要与政府同步理解并对其日益提升的系统重要性做出调整。	This demands deeper comprehension of technology-driven structural changes, with Big Tech recognizing and adjusting to its growing systemic importance in step with government.
自Facebook 和Twitter被曝光在2016年美国总统竞选期间起着传播假消息和炮制不信任和种族对立的关键作用以来，越来越多的人要求加强监管。	Since the revelations that Facebook and Twitter played a key role in disseminating false information and sowing mistrust and racial tension in the 2016 US election, a growing chorus has called for stricter regulations.
阿萨德政权将垂死挣扎转化为种族和宗派冲突的行径将对整个地区造成严重的破坏，而首当其冲受到影响的就是巴嫩和伊拉克等邻国。	The regime’s effort to turn its struggle for survival into an ethnic and sectarian conflict could wreak havoc across the region, starting with neighbors like Lebanon and Iraq.
中国政府不愿人民币快速升值可能是因为其厌恶不可预知的大幅波动，特别是在其准备将人民币推向国际储备货币地位的时候。	The Chinese government’s reluctance to allow faster exchange-rate appreciation may reflect its aversion to large, unforeseeable fluctuations, particularly given its determination to make the renminbi an international reserve currency.
全球化的受益者通常用促进新活动、有利于实体经济而不是金融的政策，以及强调高生产率就业的连续改革的战略来对全球化进行补充。	The beneficiaries of globalization are typically those countries that complemented it with a strategy to promote new activities, policies that favored the real economy over finance, and sequential reforms that emphasized high-productivity employment.
尽管传统上贸易被认为是决定汇率的主要因素，汇率涨跌通常被认为可以纠正一国的对外贸易失衡，但当今资本跨境流动规模已经非常庞大，它们对汇率的冲击比以前大很多 。	While trade is supposed to be the primary driver of exchange rates, which should rise or fall to correct countries’ external imbalances, capital flows have grown to the point that their role in guiding exchange rates is now much larger.
比方说非洲和印度乡下都有不少自行车维修点、报摊和小商店，可以对店主进行培训，让他们学会安装并维护这些系统。	For example, bicycle mechanics, who are plentiful in Africa and rural India, or small shop and kiosk owners could be trained to install and maintain these systems.
“伊拉克名单”在2010年3月的议会选举中赢得的席位最多，但其领导人，前总理伊亚德·阿拉维将不会再任旧职。	Iraqiya won the largest share of seats in the March 2010 parliamentary elections, yet its leader, former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, will not return to his old job.
这表明，尽管释放囚犯可以促成短期协议，但并没有带来旨在形成基于信任的、能带来持续和平的协议的真正努力。	This suggests that, while the prisoner release may lead to a short-term agreement, it is not backed by a genuine effort to develop the kind of trust-based arrangements that are needed for lasting peace.
如果发动袭击的主要理由是人道主义（结束对叙利亚平民的毫无意义的屠杀 ） ， 美国军事干预将弊大于利。	If the main justification for an attack is humanitarian – to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians – US military intervention would do more harm than good.
除了叙利亚，两大问题将决定新中东的未来：穆斯林兄弟会治下的埃及的道路以及伊朗核计划和地区角色图谋冲突的结果。	Along with Syria, two issues will determine this new Middle East’s future: Egypt’s path under the Muslim Brotherhood, and the outcome of confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program and regional role.
现在，我们可以发现一些对人类观察者来说不那么容易发现的新模式 — — 这已经为我们带来降低能源消费和二氧化碳排放的方法。	We can now find new patterns that are not readily evident to the human observer – and this already suggests ways to lower energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
日本要求其航空公司无视中国有关航班预先通知的要求，中国要求一切航班均需预先通知，即使这些航班只是途径新识别区，而不是飞往中国领空。	Japan has asked its airlines to ignore China’s demand for advance notification of flights, even if they are merely transiting the new zone and not heading toward Chinese territorial airspace.
这一次，美国十分愿意通过充分的合作来促进海地的经济发展：再发生一连串的事故只能引起混乱，包括大量新的难民流入美国。	This time, the US has a strong interest in cooperating fully to promote economic progress: another round of failure would only provoke chaos, including massive numbers of new refugees to the US.
但不妨换一个角度看待危机和我们的金融机构：金融系统距离悬崖边缘从未如此之远，即使是在2008年之前。 这是因为税收制度鼓励金融企业过度负债。	But consider another way of viewing the crisis and our financial institutions: the financial system was never all that far from the cliff’s edge, even before 2008, because the tax system encouraged financial firms to overload themselves with debt.
但满足民众安全需求所需的多数政策都超出了国家政府的能力范畴，特别是当这些政府自己还在想办法适应的时候。	But most of the policy responses needed to meet people’s demand for greater security are beyond the scope and reach of national governments, especially when these governments are trying to cope on their own.
中国领导人将中国对印度的不对称贸易关系 — — 出口比进口高五倍多 — — 视为破坏其对手的制造业基础，同时还能斩获可观的利润的战略武器。	Chinese leaders value the lopsided trade relationship with India – exports are more than five times higher than imports – as a strategic weapon to undercut its rival’s manufacturing base while reaping handsome profits.
丹佛 — — 从4月27日韩国总统文在寅和朝鲜总统金正恩举行最高首脑会晤以来，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普就一直不遗余力地想要证明自己才是朝韩外交背后的策划者，这一点丝毫也不出人意料。	DENVER – Since the April 27 summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump has sought, unsurprisingly, to portray himself as the mastermind behind inter-Korean diplomacy.
类似地，1987年至1993年巴勒斯坦第一次抵抗运动（Intifada）后，以色列国防界领导了和平努力。	Similarly, in the aftermath of the first Intifada, the Palestinian uprising that lasted from 1987 to 1993, the defense establishment led the effort for peace.
德国现在得求神拜佛，希望人们 — — 德国选民和中国基金管理者 — — 现在把这些承诺当真，又在十年后把它们忘掉。	The best hope for Germany is that people – both German voters and Chinese fund managers – will take such promises seriously now, but forget about them in ten years.
即使是他对缅甸的历史性访问 — — 他是第一个访问该国的美国总统 — — 对贸易的关注也将不亚于促使这个具有战略地理重要性的资源丰富国家摆脱中国的影响。	Even his historic visit to Myanmar – the first ever by a US president – is as much about trade as it is about weaning a strategically located, resource-rich country from Chinese influence.
阿富汗战争造成美军伤亡人数比前几场战争都要少，但人力成本仍然非常巨大 — — 特别是在考虑到阿富汗方面的伤亡后。	While the war in Afghanistan may have resulted in fewer American deaths and injuries than previous US wars, the human cost remains substantial – especially after factoring in Afghan deaths and injuries.
至于中国的银行，主要问题似乎是地方政府债务膨胀带来的，根据政府数据，截止2010年底的地方政府债务总值达1.7万亿美元（约占GDP30%的份额 ） 。	As for Chinese banks, the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local-government debt, which, according to the government, totaled $1.7 trillion (roughly 30% of GDP) at the end of 2010.
新的奥巴马政府提出了开支计划，其中赤字超过一万亿美元，这会创下新的纪录。 而这还是在刚离任的布什政府已经创下了有史以来的最高赤字之后。	The new Obama administration is proposing spending plans that would create a record US deficit of more than one trillion dollars – and this coming on top of the outgoing Bush administration’s record deficit.
这样对移民进行攻击或许能够带来一些即时的政治利益，但是最终结果必定会使社会分裂，而社会的凝聚力已经受到了经济危机严重影响。	Such attacks on immigration might offer some instant political gratification, but their net result is to cleave societies whose cohesion is already seriously challenged by the economic crisis.
去年乌克兰的经常帐户赤字约为GDP的8.3 % ， 导致其外汇储备不断减少，仅能维持两个月的进口所需。	Its current-account deficit last year was an estimated 8.3% of GDP, and its foreign-currency reserves are quickly being depleted, covering just over two months of imports.
诺贝尔经济学奖获得者阿玛蒂亚·森强调：大多数饥荒发生时粮食都并非真的紧缺，而是未能把粮食运到需要的人们手中，这在很大程度上是因为他们缺乏购买力。	The Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen has emphasized that most famines are associated not with a shortage of food, but the failure to get food to the people who need it, largely because they lack purchasing power.
过度储蓄又没有面临增加支出的市场压力的债权经济体，以及过度支出并面临市场压力、被迫增加储蓄的债务经济体，它们之间的不对称调整也放大了需求短缺。	So has the asymmetric adjustment between over-saving creditor economies that face no market pressure to spend more, and over-spending debtor economies that do face market pressure and have been forced to save more.
这种极端主义也正在缓慢但逐步地孕育着自己的反对力量，正如我们看到反伊斯兰政党在欧洲大选中逐渐得势，而欧洲领导人关于文化多元化的宣言都沦为废纸。	This extremism is, slowly but surely, producing its own reaction, as we see from Islamaphobic parties’ electoral gains in Europe, and statements by European leaders that multiculturalism has failed.
美国银行手上还有第三张合约（假设对手是贝尔斯登 ） ， 这张合约通过清算所进行，价值1亿美元，但亏损方是贝尔斯登。	BofA also has a contract with, say, Bear Stearns through the clearinghouse for $100 million, with Bear Stearns on the losing end.
他似乎更不会因为将其政府带入一场国际会议而与以色列交恶，就像他的父亲在1991年时与沙米尔总理之间那样。	Nor does he seem eager to open a rift with Israel by dragging its government to an international conference, the way his father did with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1991.
这时，约翰·斯诺（John Snow）挺身而出。 他是一位有开创精神的医生，直觉地认为霍乱不是如同传统智慧认为的那样通过空气传播，而是通过水传播。	Enter John Snow, a pioneering physician who had intuited that cholera was spread not through the air, as conventional wisdom held, but through water.
但随后它们“创建了国家，指定了统治者，划定了边境 ， （ 并引入了）国家制度 ” ， 但这并没有奏效。	But then they “created countries, nominated rulers, delineated frontiers, [and introduced] a state system” that would not work.
尽管它的资产翻了倍，达到3万多亿欧元（折合约4万亿美元 ） ， 欧洲已经在四年中第二次回落到衰退状态。	Despite a doubling of its balance sheet, to a little more than €3 trillion ($4 trillion), Europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years.
相反，基地组织的领导人仍固执地要在整个穆斯林世界建立极端伊斯兰统治，并不惜向一大批被认为是阻碍这一目标的国家宣战。	Al-Qaeda leaders, by contrast, remain wedded to the goal of establishing radical Islamist regimes throughout the Muslim world and waging war against a long list of governments that they see as hostile to this objective.
提高公众意识、改善卫生条件、改进监管方式等其余四诫也取得了某些进展，并大幅降低了农业抗生素的使用 — — 但这还远远不够。	There has been some progress on the remaining four Commandments – greater public awareness, improved sanitation, improved surveillance, and dramatically reduced usage of antibiotics in agriculture – but not enough.
但就目前而言，有关英国脱欧的政策 — — 无论是在英吉利海峡的哪一边 — — 都是市场友好型解决方案的绊脚石。	But, for now, the politics of Brexit – on both sides of the English Channel – are standing in the way of a market-friendly solution.
最后，法国前总统尼古拉·萨科齐（Nicolas Sarkozy）将得势，因为当今的欧元区是由一个由成员国政府首脑（极其财政部长）组成的事实上的经济政府所领导。	In the end, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has prevailed, because the eurozone today is led by a de facto economic government that comprises member countries’ heads of state and government (and their finance ministers).
看来，欧盟委员会酝酿开征金融交易税，背后就是这个想法。 欧洲的经济金融沉疴每况愈下，那便是它新开的药方。	That seems to be the thinking behind the European Commission’s proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) – the Commission’s latest response to Europe’s festering growth and financing problems.
因此，来自全世界的公共知识分子小组组成了国际公司税改革独立委员会（ICRICT ） ， 由我担任主席。	That is why a group of public intellectuals from around the world has created the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), which I chair.
我们目前这场革命始于20世纪60年代的硅谷，而且与摩尔定律密切相关：电脑芯片上的晶体管数量每两三年就会翻一番。	Our current revolution, which began in Silicon Valley in the 1960s, is bound up with Moore’s Law: the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles every couple of years.
几十年来，对于每项价值超过2亿美元的协议，卡扎菲都���自审阅，而且他往往会选择那些外国公司会接收合同的协议。	For decades, Qaddafi personally reviewed every agreement worth more than $200 million and often chose which foreign firms would receive contracts.
结果，与西欧的趋同之路有所放缓，许多国家将远远落后 — — 这一结果与2005年左右时所构想的愿景截然不同，当时，在一代人的时间里实现趋同看起来大有希望。	As a result, convergence with Western Europe could slow, with many countries lagging far behind – a far different outcome from that envisioned during the boom of the mid-2000s, when convergence within a generation seemed almost like a birthright.
就共和党人而言，他们分为传统的自由市场、自由贸易保守派和特朗普“经济民族主义者 ” ， 这些人希望限制移民和贸易，用以代替美国贸易伙伴所做出的让步。	For their part, the Republicans are divided between traditional free-market, free-trade conservatives and Trumpian “economic nationalists” who want to restrict immigration and trade in lieu of concessions by America’s trading partners.
甚至连土地和海洋的化学成分也发生着变化。 海水的酸性日益增强—进而威胁着珊瑚礁—就是二氧化碳含量增加的结果。	Even the chemistry of the land and ocean is changing, with the ocean becoming more acidic – thus threatening coral reefs – as a result of higher carbon dioxide.
意大利和法国的政治和经济弱势，以及英国的逐渐从欧盟事务中抽身凸显出德国在当前危机中捍卫欧元区的关键作用。	The political and economic weakness of France and Italy, together with Britain’s gradual withdrawal from EU affairs, highlight Germany’s key role in rescuing the eurozone from the current crisis.
如果我们只依赖双边协议，推动在困难的关键问题上达成共识的共同空间和协同将越来越窄直至消失，从气候变化到安全问题都是如此。	If we depend solely on bilateral deals, the shared spaces and synergies that facilitate agreement on difficult but vital topics – from climate change to security – will narrow until they disappear.
这一回，美联储依然是断然否认：2009年以来，如果不是QE压低了发达国家的利率，追逐收益率将不会导致新兴市场被短期“热”钱吞没。	It remains steeped in denial: Were it not for the interest-rate suppression that QE has imposed on developed countries since 2009, the search for yield would not have flooded emerging economies with short-term “hot” money.
更令人惊讶的是，哥本哈根政治家们自信地宣称，现在减排二氧化碳终将使这座城市及其居民更加富裕，化石燃料价格上涨后今天昂贵的绿色能源投资终将带来回报。	More surprisingly, Copenhagen’s politicians have confidently declared that cutting CO2 now will ultimately make the city and its citizens wealthier, with today’s expensive green-energy investments more than paying off when fossil-fuel prices rise.
去年签署的八国集团协定同意免除18个最贫困国家的债务¾这18个国家中的16个来自非洲，另外两个来自拉美。 这份协议开了个好头，但是还远远不够。	The G-8 countries’ agreement last year to a debt write-off for the 18 poorest states – 16 in Africa and two in Latin America – is a splendid, but insufficient, beginning.
而在其2027年全面实施时，它将增加大多数中间阶层美国人（位于收入分布中段的那60 % ） 的缴税额。	And, when fully implemented (in 2027), it will increase taxes on a majority of Americans in the middle (the second, third, and fourth quintiles).
但是，最近，欧洲大陆遇到了关于如何解决这一问题的意识形态僵局，环境可持续性和经济增长常常被描述为水火不容。	Lately, however, the continent has reached an ideological impasse over how to address the problem, with environmental sustainability and growth often portrayed as being mutually exclusive.
事实上，若不能在各层次同时实现高质量教育 — — 从学前教育直到大学或同等学力职业培训 — — 就实现包容增长模式就几乎无望。	Indeed, without high-quality education at all levels – from preschool through university or the equivalent professional training – it is nearly impossible to achieve inclusive growth patterns.
任何产品创新都需要一系列的创意，搞清它们对最终成果相对贡献其可能性可以说微乎其微，更不用说分清哪些是最新创意了。	The creation of any product requires many ideas, and sorting out their relative contribution to the outcome – let alone which ones are really new – can be nearly impossible.
不过，虽然聚变过程产生了一定能量（具体来讲是1，600万瓦特 ） ， 科学家们还没有成功完成能自我持续的核聚变“燃烧”过程。	But, while the fusion process has produced some power (16 million watts of it, to be specific), scientists have yet to create a self-sustaining fusion “burn.”
雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安的新当选政府那时就开始了一系列雄心勃勃的改革，以满足欧盟对其成员国的政治标准。	Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s newly elected government had embarked on a series of ambitious reforms to meet the European Union’s political criteria for membership.
"当被问及接受特奥·范霍赫采访时有何感想，欧盟执行委员鲍克斯坦说 ： "" 他直截了当是件好事；可莽撞无礼就不是了 。 """	"When asked what it was like to be interviewed by Theo van Gogh, European Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said, ""He was impertinent, and that is a good thing; he was offensive, and that is not."""
我们欧洲人可以划定我们自己的红线，警告俄罗斯，如果越线，我们将收紧对俄制裁，因为从此以后它将为其叙利亚附庸的罪行负责。	We in Europe can draw our own red line, warning Russia that, if the line is crossed, we will increase sanctions against it as a state henceforth held to be responsible for the crimes of its Syrian vassal.
一些出资人 — — 如法国、德国和欧洲投资银行 — — 正在游说经合组织发展援助委员会将无补贴贷款列为ODA，以使它们实现它们的ODA目标。	And some donors – such as France, Germany, and the European Investment Bank – are lobbying the OECD Development Assistance Committee to count unsubsidized loans as official development assistance to enable them to meet their ODA targets.
而且，在联合国气候谈判中，他们已经提出了全新的解决办法：一项名为减少因森林砍伐和森林退化而造成碳排放 （REDD+）的行动计划。	And, at UN climate talks, they have come up with a novel solution: an initiative called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
尽管北冰洋在夏天冰雪消融，但在一年中多数时候却都是冰雪覆盖，冰川融化所形成的冰山不仅越来越大，也越来越常见。	Even if the Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free in the summer, most of the year it is not, and icebergs from melting glaciers will become more common and possibly larger.
巴黎 — — 法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙将预定于2019年5月举行的欧洲议会选举认定为不光是传统右翼和左翼党派之间的斗争，还包括民粹主义者和像他自己一样的亲欧洲进步人士。	PARIS – French President Emmanuel Macron has framed the European Parliament election in May 2019 as a battle not between the traditional right and left, but between populists and pro-European progressives like himself.
一个软弱的过渡时期政府—或外来占领方的权力机构—不应该试图实施诸如国家资源私有化这样的政策，尤其在这样做可能引发政治对抗的情况下。	A weak interim national government – or a United Nations or foreign occupying administration – should not attempt to implement policies such as privatizing national resources when doing so might incite political resistance.
我们有理由去否定麦克阿斯基尔的决定，但我们同时也必须承认 — — 除非事情另有隐情 — — 他是被我们所能实践的某种最崇高的价值所感召。	We can reasonably disagree with MacAskill’s decision, but we should acknowledge that – unless there is more going on than appears on the surface – he was motivated by some of the finest values we are capable of exercising.
欧盟各国对高敏感度情报以及治安信息的交流程度堪称前所未有，并因此在确保高度法制和民主的同时提升了公共安全。	EU member states share highly sensitive intelligence and police information as never before, thereby increasing public security while upholding world-class legal and democratic standards.
但是，更有可能的是，在经历了多年的缓慢复苏后，美国经济也许终于已经准备好大步向前了，至少可以维持一段时间。	Still, it is far more likely that after years of slow recovery, the US economy might at last be ready to move significantly faster, at least for a while.
不出意料，在整个社会都承受着空前经济压力时央行竟敢公开出手援助特定金融机构，很快就令央行独立性这个概念成为了政治雷区。	Not surprisingly, the notion of independence for central banks that visibly aided specific financial institutions – and this at a time when society as a whole was under unprecedented economic stress – quickly became politically toxic.
虽然将萨科齐比做通敌卖国的马绍尔·贝当维希政权显然是有点夸张，但罗卡尔的忧虑也是许多法国人的感受 — — 而且不仅限于知识分子和权威专家。	Equating Sarkozy with Marshal Pétain’s collaborationist Vichy regime is, of course, an exaggeration, but Rocard’s concerns are shared by many French – and not only intellectuals and pundits.
因此，禁止同性恋行为的根本问题不在于国家用法律来实行某种道德观，而在于该法律是建立在认为同性恋不道德的错误观点之上。	The underlying problem with prohibiting homosexual acts, then, is not that the state is using the law to enforce private morality. It is that the law is based on the mistaken view that homosexuality is immoral.
要在不同文化的国家之间进行对比会比较困难，但是同样的结果也出现在一个国家的内部，除开那些极低收入水平的人，比如在美国年收入低于12000美元的人。	Comparisons between countries with different cultures are difficult, but the same effect appears within countries, except at very low income levels, such as below $12,000 annually for the US.
另一个重要性下降的政策领域是内部市场 — — 这是一个值得关注的决定，因为自1958年欧盟成立以来，它一直是欧洲工程的核心。	Another policy area that has lost its centrality is the internal market – a notable decision, given that it has been the centerpiece of the European project since the Commission was created in 1958.
欧盟或许已经在走下坡路，但基辅独立广场（Maidan Square）的壮观景象有力地提醒我们，欧洲的核心价值仍具有吸引力。	The shine may have come off the EU, but the gripping scenes from Kyiv’s Maidan Square are a powerful reminder of the enduring appeal of Europe’s core values.
这种方式已经在当地的非暴力抵抗运动中得以显现，同样体现这一新潮流的还有国际社会施压以色列的抵制、撤资和制裁运动（BDS ） 。	Such an approach has been exemplified in local non-violent resistance movements, as well as the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement to pressure Israel at the international level.
该机构2009年脱胎自昔日的金融稳定性论坛，基本上没有任何权力，也没有正式地位，直到最近才成为独立法律实体。	That body, which emerged from the old Financial Stability Forum in 2009 with few powers and no formal status, has only recently become a separate legal entity.
不，无论我们是否愿意承认，真正的区别是中共政府成功地将其人口中的很大一部分全球化了，远远超过印度民主政府所达到的水平。	No, the real difference – whether we like to admit it or not – is that China’s communist government has succeeded in globalizing a much larger share of its population than India’s democratic government has managed to do.
金融系统变得更为集中，导致银行问题进一步恶化 — — 它们不仅规模太大，关联和联系太紧密以致无法任由其破产，而且更加难以管理和对公众负责。	The financial system has become even more concentrated, exacerbating the problem of banks that are not only too big, too interconnected, and too correlated to fail, but that are also too big to manage and be held accountable.
风险已经改变 — — 并且已经从银行系统转移出去 — — 因此监管者和监督者必须采取行动，将注意力扩大到银行之外。	Because risks have morphed – and migrated out of the banking system – regulators and supervisors will have to step up their efforts and widen their focus to see beyond the banks.
在“经济和就业”类的前十大观点中有三个与增加大银行约束有关 — — 而对于“拆分花旗集团 ” （ Break Up Citigroup）的支持更是急剧增加（充分披露：该主题由我建议该网站列出 ） 。	Three of the top ten ideas under “Economy & Jobs” are about imposing greater constraints on the big banks – and there is a sharp upward trend in support for Break Up Citigroup (full disclosure: I suggested this item for the website).
它们似乎想要先把私人部门吓怕，这样一来，在财政大斧头真正砍下来的时候，消费者和投资者才会相信大难已经避免，从而增加支出。	It as if they are trying to terrorize the private sector, so that when the fiscal ax actually falls, consumers and investors will be sufficiently relieved that disaster has been averted that they will increase spending.
无论如何，美国应该强力领导世界的前提建立在这样的观点上：没有仁慈的超级霸权充当世界警察，世界就会陷入混乱，就会有邪恶势力主宰世界。	Either way, the premise that the US should lead forcefully rests on the idea that without a benevolent hegemonic power to police the world, chaos will ensue and more malevolent forces will take over.
萨普的回答可能不是最聪明的，但是如果评委对印度人是多么渴望在体育上取得成功有任何的了解的话，他们就会明白她不是在表达一个很荒谬的要务。	Sapre’s answer might not have been the brightest, but if the judges had any idea of how desperate Indians are for sporting success, they would have understood that she was not expressing such an absurd priority.
当前，有人将危机和日本20世纪90年代的经历进行对比 — — 这是日本“失去的十年 ” ， 在经济方面它也削弱了日本执政的自民党的正当性。	Currently, parallels are being drawn to Japan’s experience in the 1990’s – a “lost decade” in economic terms that also undermined the legitimacy of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
就目前而言，奥巴马依然深陷在美国国内卫生法案的政治斗争当中难以自拔，而且也难以及时地为即将给京都议定书制定后续协议的哥本哈根峰会做点什么。	Obama is still fighting back home for his healthcare initiative, and is hamstrung from acting on climate change in time for the Copenhagen summit, which is to agree on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol.
自2012年成立Rappler以来，路易萨的网站已经公开了与杜特尔特总统“禁毒战”法外处决信息有关的大量宝贵资料。	Since founding Rappler in 2012, Ressa’s website has become an invaluable source of information about the extrajudicial killings linked to President Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs.”
宏观经济行为的结构主义视角引出了一个被称为“自然”失业率的概念。 这个概念借用两次世界大战期间在欧洲出现的“自然”利率的概念。	The structuralist perspective on macroeconomic behavior led to the concept that came to be called the “natural” rate of unemployment, borrowing from the notion, which arose in Europe during the interwar years, of a “natural” interest rate.
有几个国家已经开始推行强调预防和治疗而非打击的政策 — — 并将重点放到真正的敌人身上，那就是有组织犯罪。	Several countries are pursuing policies that emphasize prevention and treatment rather than repression – and refocusing their repressive measures on fighting the real enemy: organized crime.
事实上，这场尤先科和特莫申科领导的和平革命提醒了我们基辅在被迫让路给专制的莫斯科之前文明发展到多么高的程度。	Indeed, that peaceful revolution, led by Viktor Yushchenko and Yuliya Tymoshenko, was a reminder of how enlightened Kievan Rus had been before it was forced to give way to the despotic princes of Moscow.
在蒂勒森漫长的国际交易经验中 — — 这和外交并不是一回事 — — 他与俄罗斯总统普京建立了紧密的关系，而特朗普对普京的太对相当“软 ” 。	In his extensive international deal-making – which isn’t the same as diplomacy – Tillerson has developed a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, toward whom Trump has been notably soft.
这一新管道包围乌克兰、波兰当然还有波罗地海三国，将会为俄罗斯在寻求地区影响力的过程中提供更大的手段。	By circumventing Ukraine, Poland, and of course, the Baltic countries, the new pipeline promises greater leverage to the Kremlin as it seeks to reassert itself regionally.
当中国的高速工业发展提升了对德国传统出口需求的同时，欧元也为德国在欧洲南部地区创造了极为蓬勃的外部需求。	Until recently, the euro also provided booming external demand in southern Europe, while China’s breakneck industrial development raised demand for Germany’s traditional exports.
从工业革命到现在，西方的发展一直没有受到任何环境方面的约束，因此新兴国家认为，调整成本不应该由它们来承担。	From the Industrial Revolution until very recently, the West’s development was free of any environmental restrictions, and the emerging countries believe that they should not have to bear the adjustment cost.
2008年，美联储与十个发达经济体的中央银行建立了货币互换机制，其中包括欧元区，英国，日本，瑞士，和四个新兴经济体（巴西，韩国，墨西哥，新加坡 ） 。	In 2008, the Fed established currency-swap lines with the central banks of ten developed economies, including the eurozone, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland, and four emerging economies (Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, and Singapore).
同样令人恐怖的是，最严重的迫害对准了耶西迪人（Yedizi，与库尔德人一起生活的古老宗教群体 ） 。	As terrible as all of this is, the worst of the persecution has been aimed at the Yezidi, an ancient religious group that lives among the Kurds.
理查德·尼克松就是一个最好的例子，虽然他从来没有表达过对犹太人的好感，但不用质疑，在他的执政时期，以色列仍然是白宫最坚定的盟友。	That was clearly the case with Richard Nixon, who never suffered from an excess of love for Jews, but was nonetheless one of the staunchest allies that Israel ever had in the White House.
世界反兴奋剂机构（WADA）早在2003年就禁止使用基因兴奋剂，但有些科学家仍然认为，滥用基因兴奋剂的情况很可能会在2008年北京奥运会中出现。	The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibited gene doping in 2003, but some scientists predict that its misuse in sport is likely to appear at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.
意大利和西班牙政府指出，它们的高借贷成本基本上是兑换风险的反映，欧洲央行应该采取一切必要手段纠正这一问题。	The Italian and Spanish governments argue that their high borrowing costs largely reflect convertibility risks, and that the ECB should do as much as necessary to address them.
事实上，中国经济的真实状况早已无法摸透，但因目前更严厉的监管而暴露出来 — — 比如将人民币的投机交易粉饰成贸易支付。	In fact, the Chinese economy’s true condition had long been obscured, but has now been exposed by more stringent regulation of activities such as speculative trading of the renminbi masquerading as trade payments.
该国经济实际是权贵资本主义的一个变种，经济成功并非来自于孕育了自由的自由市场竞争，而是取决于谁在政界有“关系 ” 。	Its economy is a variant of crony capitalism, in which economic success depends on one’s political connections, rather than on the meritocratic free-market competition from which liberty grows.
发自纽黑文 — — 最近出现的全球经济走弱迹象令许多人开始思考未来几年的恶劣经济表现究竟会蔓延到何种地步。	NEW HAVEN – Recent indications of a weakening global economy have led many people to wonder how pervasive poor economic performance will be in the coming years.
法国评论员赫尔·加文（Hervé Juvin）在他2005年的黑马作品《身体的起源》中赞扬了这种新态度。	The French commentator Hervé Juvin extolled this new attitude towards the body in his 2005 surprise bestseller, L’avènement du corps (The Coming of the Body) .
而这类结构性变革有时会同时具备得益和破坏的双重属性，对此政策制定者们一直以来都奋力想在抽象的开放原则和具体措施之间找寻平衡，以避免变革所导致的最恶劣影响。	Structural change can be simultaneously beneficial and disruptive. And policymakers have long had to strike a balance between the abstract principle of openness and concrete measures to limit the worst effects of change.
这一在2005年联合国大会一致通过的原则在其他地区都能良好地贯彻，包括支持2008年对肯尼亚的外交干预。	That principle, unanimously agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2005, has been successfully invoked elsewhere, including in support of diplomatic intervention in Kenya in 2008.
这在推高了美元价值的同时也长期削弱了美国的出口竞争力，正如伦敦金融城提供的金融产品在对其欧盟成员国资格毫无异议的年代里推高了英镑，打击了英国出口那样。	This has driven up the dollar’s value and chronically undermined export competitiveness, much like the financial products offered by the City of London did in the UK by fueling sterling appreciation in the years of undisputed EU membership.
说服大国销毁核武器或许看上去就像让美国国会通过枪支管制法一样在政治上想入非非，但在这个问题上，奥巴马已经明确表示自己愿意尝试。	Convincing great powers to eliminate their nuclear arsenals might seem as politically fanciful as pushing gun-control legislation through the US Congress, but on that issue, too, Obama has made clear that he is willing to try.
如果一项政策能大大提振国内经济，给外国带来的负面溢出效应只是暂时的，那么也应该获得绿灯（这项政策对外国经济也是有益的，因为最终本国经济的进口需求将得到提振 ） 。	A policy could also be green if it jump-starts the home economy with only temporary negative spillovers for the foreign economy (the policy will still be good for the foreign economy by eventually boosting the home economy’s demand for imports).
索马里兰可以算做盟友之一，这个国家以前曾是英国的保护国，1991年从索马里独立，位于埃塞俄比亚的东北部。	One such ally could be Somaliland, the former British protectorate, which broke away from Somalia in 1991 and lies to the northeast of Ethiopia.
香港 — — 世界领导人将于本周末的法国戛纳G20峰会上聚首，而他们将面临的下一个经济雷区已经浮现在了眼前。	HONG KONG – With world leaders meeting at the end of this week at the G-20 summit in Cannes, France, the next economic minefield that they will face is already coming into view.
比如，埃及新旧军事统治者认定，美国的批评可以忽略，因为出于地缘政治原因，美国不可能取消对埃及的援助。	Egypt’s old-new military rulers, for example, have concluded that American criticism can be ignored, because America cannot cut off its aid to Egypt for geopolitical reasons.
但在长期，它可能减少美国就业，缩小北美占全球市场的比例，并破坏美国在国际贸易问题上的信誉 — — 与此同时也无法降低美国经常项目赤字。	But in the long run, it will likely reduce US employment, shrink North America’s share of the global auto market, and undermine America’s credibility on international trade issues – all while failing to reduce the US current-account deficit.
从更广的角度，尽管我的祖国身处千钧一发之势，但乌克兰应该获得清晰的路线图走出当前的安全“灰色地带 ” ， 走向欧洲-大西洋未来。	"More broadly, despite the highly charged situation in our country, Ukraine deserves a clear road map out of its current security “grey zone"" and toward a Euro-Atlantic future."
我知道民主的辉煌时代曾被践踏，1956年在布达佩斯，1968年在布拉格，以及1989年在天安门广场。	I know that stirrings of democracy have been crushed before: in Budapest in 1956, Prague in 1968, and in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
小学和中学的努力有助于在女生中培养更多样化的兴趣，让有才华的年轻女性获得她们所需要的工具，在关键经济部门做出重要贡献。	Efforts by primary and secondary schools could help to foster more diverse interests among female students, giving talented young women the tools they need to make important contributions to key economic sectors.
要说谁懂得行胜于言的道理，那一定是普京 — — 他经常断然否认证据确凿的坏事，比如干预美国选举和违反条约。	If anyone knows that actions speak louder than words, it is Putin, whose words often include transparent denials of documented wrongdoing, from meddling in the US election to violating treaties.
但是，为了赢得美国的重视，欧盟需要拿出设计完善而且资源配置合理的方案，而不是随随便便地提出27条不成熟的想法。	But, in order to be taken seriously by the US, the EU needs to bring well-developed, well-resourced policies to the table, rather than 27 half-baked ideas.
在侍从军官行刺企图失败后，达迪斯·卡马拉逃往国外，接替他的临时军政府领袖赛古巴·科纳特将军允许反对党任命一位平民总理。	Following an assassination attempt by an aide-de-camp, Dadis Camara fled the country, and the interim junta leader, General Sékouba Konaté, allowed the opposition political parties to appoint a civilian prime minister.
回顾他的一生，阿拉法特从未真正改变过自己的信仰：那就是把不惜一切手段毁灭以色列，代之以巴勒斯坦阿拉伯国家当作自己的终身目标。	Looking back at his career, Arafat never really veered from the belief that his life's mission was to destroy Israel by any means necessary and replace it with a Palestinian Arab state.
鉴于会议内容往往要临场确定，要确保有限度营销确实存在一定难度；发言人可能会出人意料地利用讲台宣传某种产品，这么做可能导致他/她被从今后的邀请名单上排除。	Given that the content is being created in real time, this can be challenging; a speaker may unexpectedly use the stage to promote a product, in which case he or she would probably not be invited back.
更世俗的真理是，昔日维持伊斯兰世界和平的是奥斯曼、不列颠和法兰西帝国，在它们分崩离析后，一直没有稳定的继任者产生。	The more mundane truth is that there have never been any stable successors to the defunct Ottoman, British, and French empires that used to keep the peace in the Islamic world.
En outre, même si la Commission européenne a clairement le devoir de d’empêcher la mauvaise gestion et la fraude, il se trouve que chaque demande de financement de l’UE demande des procédures extrêmement onéreuses.	Moreover, although the European Commission clearly has a duty to prevent mismanagement and fraud, every application for EU funding requires extremely onerous procedures.
如果说斯大林的道德记录有什么“模糊不清”的地方，可能是共产主义于我们的崇高目标 — — 人人平等、终结贫穷 — — 有共鸣之处。	If there is any “ambiguity” about Stalin’s moral record, it may be because communism strikes a chord with some of our nobler impulses, seeking equality for all and an end to poverty.
然而，即使许多公正和发展党的激进分子和选民都是虔诚的穆斯林，埃尔多安和居尔仍然致力于加入欧洲的一体化。	Yet, even if many AKP activists and voters are devout Muslims, Erdogan and Gul remain committed to European integration.
随着全球经济增长回暖以及某些地缘政治不确定性的出现（可能会限制一些产油国的产量 ） ， 目前油价已回升至每桶60美元以上。	With the pickup in global growth and the emergence of geopolitical uncertainties (which could constrain output in some oil-producing countries), oil prices have rebounded to above $60 per barrel.
该办法既更加累进，也更加有效：资本是高度流动的，因此从公民个人和股东居民头上征税要比从跨国公司头上征税容易得多。	It is both more progressive and more effective: with highly mobile capital, it is far easier to collect taxes from individual citizens and resident shareholders than from multinational companies.
在法国和阿拉伯国家关系方面，可以肯定地说，奥朗德同意奥巴马2009年开罗演讲的提倡包容（pro-engagement）的观点。	With regard to relations between France and the Arab world, one can be certain that Hollande would agree with the pro-engagement thrust of Obama’s 2009 Cairo speech.
我们应该停止愚蠢的害怕，停止追寻愚蠢的政策并且开始投资于长远的、聪明的研发项目。 “反人类罪”的指责必须停止。	We have to stop being scared silly, stop pursuing stupid policies, and start investing in smart long-term R&D. Accusations of “crimes against humanity” must cease.
如果观察员能体会言外之意并大量观察那些没有按照本来面目表述的东西，下任美国总统外交策的观点可以看清楚了。	Aspects of the next president’s foreign policy are there to see if observers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is.
这一可能性大小是一个连续变量，从比如O（可恶的压迫性独裁统治）直到W（管理良好、功能完善的民主 ） 。	The scale would be continuous, going from, say, O (odious repressive dictatorships) to W (well-managed and fully functioning democracies).
约旦与以色列签署的和平条约的第三和第八条款明确将难民问题作为一个主要的亟需解决的问题，同时还引证了越国界管理和耶路撒冷未解决的状况。	Articles 3 and 8 of Jordan’s peace treaty with Israel refer explicitly to the refugee problem as one of the major issues still to be resolved, as well as citing the unresolved status of trans-border arrangements and of Jerusalem.
爱尔兰在成为欧盟成员国的35年内几乎享受了不成比例的好处，到了2008年时还从欧盟预算中净赚了5亿欧元。	Ireland has benefited disproportionately from EU largesse during its 35 years of membership, and, in 2008, was still receiving a net sum of €500 million from the EU budget.
长期以来，沙特阿拉伯通过向臣民发放巨额石油财富，以及在沙特社会推行基于严格的瓦哈比派传统的原教旨伊斯兰教保持（相对）内部稳定。	Saudi Arabia has long maintained (relative) internal stability by spreading its enormous oil wealth among its subjects, and by imposing on Saudi society fundamentalist Islamic doctrines based on the austere Wahhabi tradition.
伊丽莎白女王二世有过著名的一问：经济学家为何不能预见灾难？ 她或许要求太高了些，但一个众人皆有的感觉是经济学家的研究有很多属于“无厘头 ” 。	Queen Elizabeth II may have expected too much when she famously asked why economists had failed to foresee the disaster, but there is a widespread sense that much of their research turned out to be irrelevant.
库普乾认为，外交才是战略融合和互信的基本要素，而具有相似社会秩序和民族成分的国家间更容易建立和谐的外交关系。	Rather, he regards diplomatic engagement as the essential element to strategic accommodation and mutual trust, and this is more easily accomplished if the states have similar social orders and ethnicities.
如果欧洲领导人认真对待COP21承诺，就应该在2030年在2010年消费水平的基础上减少70 % ， 这一目标比欧洲理事会2014年的目标宏大一倍。	If European leaders are serious about their COP21 commitment, they should embrace a 70% reduction on 2010 consumption levels by 2030 – more than double the European Council’s 2014 target.
分离主义分子重提18世纪英国的暴行，并称苏格兰可以借此保有全部的北海石油储量，并且不再分担英国的债务。	The secessionists hark back to eighteenth-century English brutality and claim that Scotland will be able to keep all of its North Sea oil and shed its share of the UK’s debt.
这导致那些赤字国家只能通过通货紧缩的方式来调整实际汇率 — — 但这会引发公共和私人负债持续上升，最终导致大规模的信用违约	This is forcing deficit countries into real exchange-rate adjustments via deflation – and thus a rising burden of public and private debt that may lead to disorderly defaults.
举例来讲，二十世纪七十年代秘鲁批准安第斯山脉民众有权使用驼羊毛挽救了濒于灭绝的驼羊并为当地民众创造了长期的新的收入流。	For example, in the 1970s when Peru granted Andean communities the right to use vicuña wool, it saved the vicuña from extinction and created new, long-term income streams for the community.
真正的原因在于新闻审查制度，这场爆炸其实正代表了亚美尼亚匿影藏形的反新闻界集团对新闻界发起的最新攻击。	But the real problem is censorship, for the explosion was but the latest offensive in Armenia’s hidden war against the press.
因为全球教育合作机构的资助，从2002到2014年间发展中国家接受小学教育的女童增加了3，800万人。	Thanks to GPE funding, an additional 38 million girls in developing countries were enrolled in primary school from 2002 to 2014.
如果风险资本家蒂姆·德拉珀（Tim Draper）将加利福尼亚分成六个州的错误计划成功，硅谷将是美国最富有的州，而中央山谷将是最贫穷的州。	If the venture capitalist Tim Draper had succeeded in his misguided initiative to divide California into six states, Silicon Valley would have become the richest state in the US, and the Central Valley the poorest.
诚然，特朗普和其他民粹主义者经常试图通过声称集会中有“危机演员”或“付费积极分子”来诋毁真正的抗议活动。	True, Trump and other populists often try to discredit bona fide protests by claiming that they are stocked with “crisis actors” or “paid activists.”
主角一步步向地下贩毒网堕落的过程被描写得极为详尽，在此过程中，他所作出的每一个决定几乎都是十分理性的。	The main protagonist’s step-by-step descent into the drug underworld unfolds with such subtlety that each individual decision he makes along the way seems almost reasonable.
最后，药物进入市场，也必须对其进行严格跟踪，因为许多不良反应要经过众多病人多年的使用之后才能被发现。	Finally, the drug reaches the market, where it must be followed closely, because many adverse reactions are detected only with a large number of patients and after years of use.
逆转这一趋势在银行联盟的三大关键要素���—共同监管者、共同存款保险和共同清算基金 — — 都切实具备之前是不可能的。	Reversal of that process will likely not occur until the three key elements of banking union – common supervision, common deposit insurance, and a common resolution fund – are within tangible reach.
中国对日本处于美国保护之下的状态相对感到满意，因为它担心另一种情况：一个扩展其独立军事影响力的日本。	It is relatively content with Japan being a US security protectorate, because it fears the alternative: a Japan that expands its independent military reach.
同样可能被视为作弊的还有要求以技术转让换取市场准入、偏向于国内实体的公共采购、接受不安全的工作环境及剥削性的劳动行为，还有汇率操纵。	So may requiring technology transfer in exchange for market access, public procurement favoring domestic entities, acceptance of unsafe work environments and exploitative labor practices, and exchange-rate manipulation.
最近围绕世界银行行长Paul Wolfowitz辞职的纷扰凸现了推进世行良好治理和反腐败议程的必要性。	The recent turbulence surrounding the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz from the Presidency of the World Bank has underscored the need to push ahead with the Bank’s good governance and anti-corruption agenda.
一般认为俄乌两国之所以不愿做为，是因为两国政府都将注射吸毒者视为罪犯而非需要救治的病人，因此宁愿让这些人自生自灭。	The popular explanation for lack of action in Russia and Ukraine is that their governments view IDUs as criminals, rather than people with a disease, and adopt an informal let-them-rot policy.
我们还可以认为这些措施会在2013年1月结束，届时将会有新动作，抛出新措施的既可能是连任的奥巴马，也可能是新的共和党总统。	And we can assume that it would be repealed and replaced by something else come January 2013, either by a re-elected President Barack Obama, or by a new, Republican president.
事实上，两项著名的纵向研究 — — 马萨诸塞州的弗莱明汉姆心脏研究（Framingham Heart Study）和瑞典的国王岛项目（Kungsholmen Project）在阿尔茨海默症的预测方面获得了重要进展。	In fact, two famous longitudinal studies – the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts and the Kungsholmen Project in Sweden – have led to important progress in predicting the disease.
今天，将俄国和中国联系在一起的已经不仅仅是两国的能源协议，这两个国家都认定，属于他们的时代已经到来。 世界需要他们更甚于他们需要世界，而美国尤其如此。	Russia and China today are united not only by their energy deals, but also by both countries’ conviction that their time has come, and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world, particularly the US.
尽管报告对国际合作这一方向持首肯态度，但它违反了国际共识，增加了不可逆转的基因改变风险和新的不平等形式。	Although the report nods in the direction of international cooperation, it breaches an international consensus in a way that increases the risks of irreversible genetic alterations and new forms of inequality.
巴方已经满足了以方以及国际社会提出的所有安全要求，而在两国方案上言而无信的内塔尼亚胡政府却依然不愿划定本方边界。	Palestinians complied with all Israeli and international requirements for security, while Binyamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government, which gives lip-service to the two-state solution, has yet to elucidate where Israel’s borders will be.
去年12月，公诉人指控萨哈罗夫博物馆的两名官员和三名展览组织者煽动宗教仇恨，他们面临长达5年的牢狱生涯。	Last December, prosecutors charged two Sakharov Museum officials and three of the exhibition's organizers with inciting religious hatred. They now face prison terms of up to five years.
在美国和许多欧洲国家，平均工资停滞不前，尽管从GDP和就业增长角度看，大部分经济体已经从2008年金融危机中复苏。	In the United States and many European countries, average salaries have stagnated, despite most economies having recovered from the 2008 financial crisis in terms of GDP and job growth.
过去10年来肺结核发病数的年下降率仅有1.65 % ； 而2014年一年，肺结核就夺去了150万人的生命。	The annual decline in cases over the past decade has been a mere 1.65%; in 2014, TB killed 1.5 million people.
所有非洲开发银行支持的废水管理系统都遵循可持续发展原则，以确保能提高经济收益、惠及当地社会并让当地民众负担得起相应的费用。	All AfDB-supported wastewater-management systems follow sustainability strategies to ensure that they enhance economic gains, benefit local communities, and remain affordable.
印度人民党假装这是一次中立行动，哪怕在因甄别“外国人”而额首相庆的同时，仍然强调整个过程都接受最高法院的监督。	The BJP pretends that this is a neutral exercise, emphasizing that the Supreme Court supervised the process, even as it celebrates the identification of “foreigners.”
斯堪的纳维亚人早就想通了这一点：它是维持一个开放社会 — — 全球化和技术变革开放 — — 的社会契约的一部分。	The Scandinavians figured this out long ago; it was part of the social contract that maintained an open society – open to globalization and changes in technology.
堪培拉 — — 当美国总统唐纳德·特朗普突然取消与朝鲜领导人金正恩的首脑会晤，他将原因归咎于朝鲜的公开敌意和巨大愤怒。	CANBERRA – When US President Donald Trump abruptly canceled his summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, he blamed “tremendous anger and open hostility” from the North.
最后，该赌注认为石油出口国 — — 如尼日利亚、委内瑞拉，特别还有俄罗斯 — — 将成功避免经济崩溃，即使全球油价暴跌。	Finally, the bet assumes that oil-exporting countries like Nigeria, Venezuela, and especially Russia will fend off economic implosion, even as global oil prices plummet.
即使是在言论自由受到严格保护的美国，此类煽动性言论也会遭到起诉和严惩，只要它与暴力和其他非法行为扯上关系。	Even in the US, where freedom of expression is zealously protected, such incitement may be prosecuted and punished in circumstances in which violence or other unlawful behavior is imminent.
如今，像伊斯兰国和尼日利亚博科圣地这样的组织已经加入了基地组织的队伍，诱惑世界各地的穆斯林民众，从而确保对全球圣战运动的领导。	Today, groups like the Islamic State and Nigeria’s Boko Haram have joined Al Qaeda in a struggle to attract Muslims from all over the world, thereby securing their leadership in global jihad.
事实上，福岛第一核电站防护海塘遇袭之后几小时甚至几天内所发生的事情尽管令人震惊，却称得上是核电安全性的一次有力证明。	In fact, although what happened was shocking, the events in the hours and days after a giant wave slammed over the nuclear plant’s protective seawall might be interpreted as a remarkable testament to nuclear power’s sound credentials.
雅典 — — “希腊有史以来代价最昂贵的局部政府改组 ” ， 这至少是形容9月20日希腊大选结果的一种方式。	ATHENS – “The costliest minor government reshuffle in Greece’s history.” That is at least one way to describe the result of the Greek general election on September 20.
但没有伊朗的联盟实际已成为逊尼派阵线，伊朗本应参与谈判并在平息叙利亚内战中发挥更显著的作用。 但这一切的前提是伊朗愿意签署协议控制其核计划。	Iran, without which the coalition essentially becomes a Sunni front, can have a place at the table – and play a large and overt role in resolving the Syrian civil war – but only if it is willing to reach a deal to rein in its nuclear program.
多数历史学家都认为恐怖的伊凡名副其实；他不仅杀害了他的儿子和其他亲属，还下令执行1565到1572年令俄国陷入恐怖氛围的由国家主导的清洗运动（oprichnina ） 。	Most historians agree that Ivan lived up to his name; not only did he kill his son and other relatives, he also ordered the oprichnina, the state-led purges that terrorized Russia from 1565 to 1572.
现在去岛上希腊塞浦路斯聚居地参观的人不会再看到难民营：成百上千万的游客多数都不会想到，他们碰到超过三分之一的希腊塞浦路斯人或者是难民、或者是难民的后裔。	Anyone visiting the Greek Cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps: most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the Greek Cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees.
发展中国家目前面临更高的通胀率并非是因为宏观管理不善，而是由于石油和食品价格在窜升。 与富国相比，这些项目在平均家庭预算中占据更大的比例。	Developing countries currently face higher rates of inflation not because of poorer macro-management, but because oil and food prices are soaring, and these items represent a much larger share of the average household budget than in rich countries.
这一在人类帮助下发生的新演化意味着在人类世，我们其实既是旧生物多样性的毁灭者，也是新生物多样性的创造者。	This evolution of new human-associated species means that, in the Anthropocene, we are effectively creators of new biological diversity as well as destroyers of the old.
但如今运用到现代经济领域，这样的赞美在现实中至少是尴尬的：现代经济靠几家央行堆积如山的巨额债务来稳定金融系统。	But, applied to the modern economy, such praise is awkward at best, because it is literally true: the financial system was stabilized by piling huge volumes of debt into a few central banks.
但是我们目前面临的大规模的经常项目不平衡带来的风险之一就是政客可能会指责别的国家，采取保护主义政策。	But one of the risks associated with the large current-account imbalances we now face is that politicians may decide to blame one or another country and espouse protectionist policies.
举例来说，斯堪的那维亚国家、地中海国家以及像爱尔兰和英国那样的“自由的大西洋国家”之间的差别在某些时候要比欧洲整体和美国之间的差别还要大。	The differences for instance between the Scandinavian countries, the Mediterranean countries, and the “liberal Atlantic countries” like Ireland and the UK are sometimes more pronounced than those between Europe as a whole and the US.
正如接受治疗的大鼠的行为不再那么拘谨（更加能够忍受明亮开放的空间 ） ， 接受治疗的焦虑患者也更有可能能够回到工作岗位中。	Just as medicated rats are less behaviorally inhibited (more able to tolerate bright, open spaces), medicated anxiety sufferers are more likely to be able to return to their jobs.
这一模式或许也可以用于政治关系：赫希曼曾写过一篇著名文章，证明了在1989年退出东德的可行性是如何导致忠诚突然崩溃的。	The schema might also be applied to political relations: Hirschman wrote a memorable article showing how the ability to exit East Germany in 1989 produced a sudden breakdown of loyalty.
不论在国内还是国外，分离（disconnect）的现象严重，这给“中国因素”对脆弱世界的影响增加了新的风险维度。	On both counts, the disconnects are striking, adding a new dimension of risk to the impact of the “China factor” on a fragile world.
事实上，在特朗普取胜造成的重大不确定性下，构建新型关系比以往任何时候更具有战略价值，因为全球环境不断变化，而且美中两国都面临着区域地缘政治和国内挑战。	Indeed, amid the vast uncertainty created by Trump’s victory, a new relationship now makes more strategic sense than ever, given changing global circumstances, regional geopolitics, and domestic challenges in both the US and China.
众所周知的、低成本以及低科技含量的防治手段，例如破伤风疫苗、专门母乳、低体重婴儿的简单护理以及防止传染的抗生素等并没有提供给那些最需要得到的孩子。	Well known, low-cost, and low-tech interventions do not reach those most in need – for example immunization against tetanus, exclusive breastfeeding, simple care for low-weight babies, and antibiotics for infection.
尽管如此，即使是迅速实现“更加绿色”的能源转变，也不足以让全球平均气温限定在前工业化水平以上2℃以内。	Still, not even a rapid shift toward “greener” energy will be enough to keep global average temperature within 2º of preindustrial levels.
虽然贾迈勒在埃及掌权已经没有太多障碍，但在阿尔及利亚，将赛义德扶上宝座的努力可能会在强大政权利益的抵制下付诸东流。	While few obstacles remain in Gamal’s path to power in Egypt, in Algeria, meanwhile, a bid to install Said would likely collapse against resistance from powerful regime interests.
可能还有其他办法能够解决问题：那就是像许多市场经济国家那样收紧专利法或对制药等垄断行业实行价格管制。	Other approaches are also possible: tightening up patent laws or imposing price controls for monopolistic industries, such as pharmaceuticals, as many market economies have done.
柏林—据5月初ARD德国趋势（DeutschlandTREND）的民意调查，极右翼的德国另类道路党（Alternative for Germany，AfD）的民众支持率为15 % ， 而一年前只有5 % 。	BERLIN – According to an early May opinion poll by ARD DeutschlandTREND, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party’s popular support now stands at 15%, up from around 5% a year ago.
默克尔有两个选择：她可以右倾，如法国前总统萨科齐为法国总统大选所做的最后一搏那样；她也可以硬碰AfD的简单化立场，坚持中间道路。	Merkel has two choices: She can move to the right, as former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has done in his latest bid for the French presidency, or she can fight to hold the center by addressing the AfD’s simplistic arguments head on.
但另一个有害的传说是“欧洲堡垒”正在遭受一波又一波野蛮人的冲击。 这一传说通过令人震惊的影像传播 — — 大量难民蜂拥通过边境隔离带，或者试图攀上加莱（Calais）的火车 — — 它存在两个层面的错误。	Yet another damaging myth, perpetuated by shocking images of refugees swarming through border fences or attempting to climb onto trains in Calais, is that “Fortress Europe” is under assault by waves of barbarians.
在2016年核安全峰会召开之前，我们最需要的是有一套程序促进全面解决核威胁的全球行动，确保全面禁止核试验条约生效就是其中之一。	What is most needed in the run-up to the 2016 NSS is a process that advances global action to address the nuclear threat comprehensively, including by ensuring that the CTBT enters into force.
那么，IMF给出了“资本流自由化的综合性方针 ” ， 并具体给出了改革的详细步骤，既然如此，关于资本管制和如何使其更有效也不具有什么可比性了。	So, while the Fund lays out an “integrated approach to capital flow liberalization,” and specifies a detailed sequence of reforms, there is nothing remotely comparable on capital controls and how to render them more effective.
NDPO的修改草案似乎认识到这一点，同时强调日本自卫、日美联盟的合作、以及对多边使命做出贡献的必要性。	The draft revision of the NDPO seems to recognize this, emphasizing the need for Japan’s own defense efforts, cooperation through the Japanese-US alliance, and contributions to multilateral missions.
俄罗斯目前向中国销售某些武器，但却避免向其出口最尖端的系统。 因为克里姆林宫将中国看作未来潜在的威胁。	Russia currently sells certain arms to China, but avoids exporting its most sophisticated systems, since the Kremlin views China as a potential future threat.
日益开放的金融市场让外国银行和资产管理者能够迅速甩卖债务 — — 通常是出于与经济基本面无关的理由。	Increasingly open financial markets allow foreign banks and asset managers to dump debts rapidly, often for reasons that have little to do with economic fundamentals.
与此相反，中国的腐败通常都是“利益分享”型，那些国有企业高管的家庭成员都拥有股份，他们的收益随着企业盈利的上升而增加 — — 这是某种促进经济增长的腐败。	By contrast, in China, the corruption has largely been of the “profit-sharing” variety, whereby family members are given a stake in the enterprise so that their earnings increase as profits increase – a type of corruption that promotes growth.
朝鲜领袖金正恩绝非中国邓小平式的改革分子；但因为市场不可逆转的扩张力量，他的政权正日复一日变得与中国越来越相似。	North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is no reformist like China’s Deng Xiaoping; but his regime is becoming more like China’s every day, owing to the irreversible expansion of market forces.
民主党的这项承诺本应是日本新独立自主战略的一部分，只要踏出了第一步，日本就不会再像某位自民党前首相所说的那样，仅仅是美国的一艘“航空母舰 ” 。	This promise by the DPJ was meant to be part of Japan’s new assertiveness, a first step away from being a mere “aircraft carrier” for the US, as a former LDP prime minister once described his country.
美国会愿意向印度出售进攻性武器 — — 包括高精确度常规武器、反潜系统和长程空基和地基巡航导弹 — — 以有助于威慑中国的军事先发制人吗？	Would the US be willing to sell India offensive weapons – including high-precision conventional arms, anti-submarine systems, and long-range air- and sea-launched cruise missiles – that could help to deter Chinese military preemption?
从这一技术官僚观点来看，今天的布鲁塞尔维持了某些功能，而即使在某些民族国家内部，这些功能都经常被分派到不是民主选举产生的机构中。	From this technocratic perspective, Brussels today maintains functions that even within nation states are often delegated to institutions that are not democratically elected.
库尔德人民民主党（Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party，HDP）在最近的大选中大获成功，获得13%选票 — — 远多于该党核心选区的选票比例 — — 这必然会增强库尔德人的信心，有利于和平进程。	The success of the mainly Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) in capturing 13% of the vote in the recent election – a total well above the party’s core constituency – should boost the Kurds’ confidence and ease the way ahead in the peace process.
西方自由民主国家应该如何面对一个按照自己的战略计划行动、利用它们的开放性推动它的意识形态和地缘政治目标的中国？	How should Western liberal democracies confront a China that is taking a page from their own playbook, as it exploits their openness to advance its ideological and geopolitical objectives?
但尽管当局在1999年他们上一次面临严重不良贷款问题用过这招，货币印刷机却无法与官员的另一既定目标相兼容：稳定的汇率。	But, while the authorities relied on this approach in 1999, the last time they were faced with a serious bad-loan problem, running the money printing press is not compatible with officials’ other stated goal: a stable exchange rate.
埃尔多安说他想“让阿夫林回到真正的所有者手中 ” ， 从而让350万土耳其境内叙利亚难民“尽快回到自己的土地上 ” 。	Erdoğan has claimed that he wants “to deliver Afrin to its real owners,” thereby enabling the more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey to return “to their own land as soon as possible.”
如此一来，中、东欧各国的选民们现在觉得政府让他们做了亏本生意也在情理之中：勒紧裤带、劳务市场限制和欧盟规章的狂轰滥炸。	Little wonder, then, that voters in Central and Eastern Europe now feel that they got a poor bargain from the governments that brought them in: belt tightening, labor market restrictions, and the notorious barrage of EU regulation.
鉴于人类有限的阅读速度（每分钟200-300字）和现有的巨大的信息量，当今有效的决策在知识精密化的每一个方面都需要语义技术。	Given humans’ limited reading speed (200-300 words per minute) and the enormous volume of available information, effective decision-making today calls for semantic technology in every aspect of knowledge refinement.
取得险胜的执政者上台后奉行极端主义政策也会造成类似的后果。 有人说乔治·W·布什在美国已经贯彻了这样的做法，很多人害怕奥夫拉多尔（Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador）会领导墨西哥追随布什的后尘。	The same may also be true if narrow winners adopt a radical agenda, as some think George W. Bush has done in America and many feared Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador would do in Mexico.
但他们同时引入了目的完全相反的记忆法：通过将历史暴行的责任完全推给他人 — — 无论是希特勒的德国还是斯大林的苏联 — — 来粉饰国家叙事。	But they have also introduced memory laws with essentially the opposite aim: to whitewash national narratives by shifting the responsibility for historical atrocities entirely onto others, whether Hitler’s Germany or Stalin’s Soviet Union.
相反，目前令人失望的局面正是来自结构改革逻辑：大部分改革的好处要很迟才会到来，而不是在一国真正需要它们时到来。	Instead, the current disappointment arises from the very logic of structural reform: most of the benefits come much later, not when a country really needs them.
2008年11月，载有墨西哥国家安全顾问胡安·卡米罗·马利罗（Juan Camilo Mourino）的飞机神秘坠毁。	In November, 2008, a plane carrying Juan Camilo Mourino, Mexico’s national security advisor, crashed under mysterious circumstances.
但是这一先导性工作现在处于停滞状态，而数以百万计的农民取得有效而对环境无害危机解决途径的希望也停滞了。	But the pioneering work is now on hold, as are the hopes of millions of farmers for an effective, environmentally friendly answer to the crisis.
2008年为数不多的积极结果之一是G-20全球影响力的加强；理论上，G-20是远比G-7代表性更强的国际领导力论坛。	One of the few positive consequences of the 2008 financial crisis was the elevation of the G-20's global role; in principle, it is a far more representative forum for international leadership than the G-7 ever was.
普瑞德-威利综合症则有如下特征，肌张力差，性激素水平低下以及大脑控制饱饿感的部分出现缺陷，从而导致过度进食和肥胖。	Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by poor muscle tone, low levels of sex hormones, and a defect in the part of the brain that controls feelings of satiety or hunger, which leads to overeating and obesity.
尽管ICC的总检察官Luis Moreno-Ocampo表示有信心将巴希尔绳之以法，但究竟如何操作还是个未知数。	While the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, expresses confidence that Bashir will be brought to justice, it is unclear how this will happen.
正如在线支付系统PayPal的联合创始人彼得·蒂耶（Peter Thiel）曾经指出的那样 ： “ 我们本想要能飞的汽车；谁知却最终收到了140个推特字符 。 ”	It certainly didn’t resolve the big problems, such as eradicating poverty or enabling us to reach Mars. As PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel once noted: “We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.”
是的，我们的政府的主要职责是保护我们；但每时每刻都有人死去，并且死因通常不公正；对于我们追求或可以追求多大程度保护的界线也不清晰。	Yes, our government’s primary job is to protect us; but people die all the time, often unfairly, and there are limits on how much protection we seek or even allow.
考虑到几个重要政府对投票抱有顽固的批评立场，以及若干成员国内部抗议和欧洲怀疑主义党派的势力陡增，将要进行的谈判面临着巨大的困难。	These negotiations will be much harder in view of the spectacular repudiation of a number of key governments at the ballot box, together with the potent rise of protest and Euroskeptic parties in several member states.
欧洲国家放弃繁荣的发展方式，依仗追求理论化的观点，并且这些观点脱离了国际视角，这样做对欧洲而言真的是理智的吗？	But they should not be alone. Is it reasonable that Europe’s countries give up a niche of prosperity on ideological grounds that are irrelevant from a global perspective?
如果人民银行现在只是进一步拉平不受其干预约束的卖出价，那么它就是在进一步靠近完全基于市场的汇率机制。	If the PBOC is now simply moving closer to averaging the offer prices that are not subject to its interference, it is moving closer to an entirely market-based exchange-rate regime.
诚然，一些新兴市场企业累积的美元计价外债数量令人担忧，但许多外国央行拥有充足的美元资产，特别是亚洲。	Although it is true that several emerging-market firms have piled up worrisome quantities of dollar-denominated external debt, many foreign central banks are brimming with dollar assets, especially in Asia.
知道目前，美国人通过从轻易受到影响的外国人那里廉价借钱并且把钱投资于高回报的外国资产、土地以及债券而攫取利润。	Until now, Americans have been raking in profits by borrowing cheaply from pliant foreigners and investing the money in high-yield foreign equities, land, and bonds.
蒸汽机或老式汽车的工作原理一目了然，而现代的汽车飞机如此复杂，以至于这些高科技产品的操纵者对其实际工作���理毫无概念。	In contrast to a steam engine or an old-fashioned automobile, whose operations were easily comprehensible, modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their operators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works.
虽然各国的尤其是在欧洲的众多分析家们已经得出结论，认为这类事件在可预见的将来不可能发生，但印度却是个例外。	While many analysts in a wide variety of nations, especially in Europe, have concluded that such an event could not occur there in the foreseeable future, India is an exception.
伊朗可以把公布伊朗人经常引用但是从来没有被人看见的关键文件作为一个良好的开端－例如，据传规定伊斯兰教禁止从事核武器的生产、储存和使用的阿亚图拉·哈梅内伊的裁定？	A good start would be to publish key documents that are constantly referred to by Iranians but never seen – say, Ayatollah Khamenei’s fatwa that reportedly rules that Islam prohibits the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons?
其新成立的全球基础设施便利（Global Infrastructure Facility，GIF）将动员全球退休基金和主权财富基金投资作为具体资产类别的基础设施。	Its new Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) will mobilize global pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in infrastructure as a specific asset class.
发自伦敦 — — 法国作家莫里哀的古典主义喜剧《伪君子》告诉我们，正是放任骄傲 — — 而非诉诸理性 — — 决定了一个人的行为无可避免地以糟糕收场。	LONDON – In his classic comedy “Tartuffe, or The Impostor,” Molière shows that allowing pride, rather than reason, to dictate one’s actions invariably ends badly.
无论如何，把经过基因改造的运动员贬斥为突变异种或非人类在道德上站不住脚，因为它引发了与其它生物特征，尤其是种族、性别和残疾相联系的同样的偏见，而我们对这些偏见理应深恶痛绝。	In any case, to describe genetically modified athletes as mutants or inhuman is morally suspect, for it invokes the same kind of prejudice that we deplore in relation to other biological characteristics, particularly race, gender, and disability.
华盛顿—拉马福萨（Cyril Ramaphosa）在12月的南非执政党非国大党领导人竞争中胜出，这是总统祖玛遭到否定的明确标志。	WASHINGTON, DC – Cyril Ramaphosa’s victory in December’s contest to lead South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) was a resounding repudiation of President Jacob Zuma.
这些和其他许多例子表明，如果政府能提供多样化的、相对具体的、与时俱进的正确的公共品组合，企业可以变得更加高效。	As these and many other examples show, business can become more efficient if governments provide the right combination of a diverse, relatively specific, and evolving set of public goods.
研究人员推测大约5，000年前，人类首次在非洲感染结核病，而后这种疾病迅速沿着贸易路线传播到全球几乎每一个角落。	Researchers theorize that humans first acquired TB in Africa about 5,000 years ago, and that the disease then swiftly spread along trade routes to nearly every corner of the globe.
与此同时这些妥协方案和所有财务报表或者女式泳衣有着同样的特质：那就是它们试图掩盖的部分才是最精彩的地方。	But those compromises are like statistics or skimpy swimsuits: what they show is less important than what they hide.
Spitfire战机飞行员被披头士、滚石、奇想等有力的自由象征所取代，他们的音乐如同一股清风横扫欧洲和美国。	Spitfire pilots were replaced as vigorous symbols of liberty by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Kinks, whose music swept across Europe and the United States like a gust of fresh air.
这些行为之所以有问题，原因在于它阻碍了资金的有效流动。 同样，外国政府也可以用同样的方式来对付非本国的银行。	Such actions are problematic not only because they insulate inefficient forms of production, but also because foreign countries respond by adopting similar measures towards their national champions, so that everyone is worse off.
这部“推土机”已经成为大多数以色列人的祖父，和西方外交的最后一张牌—对于意料之外的美国人和意料之中的欧洲人都是如此。	The “bulldozer” had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy, for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans, too.
《华盛顿邮报》媒体专栏玛格丽特·苏利文（Margaret Sullivan）最近观察道，对美国总统特朗普的报道狭隘地聚焦于他的用词，却忽视了他的政策。	As the Washington Post’s media columnist Margaret Sullivan recently observed, coverage of US President Donald Trump has focused narrowly on his words, at the expense of his policy.
我们的发病大部分是随机的，即使我们的医生无法告诉我们未来几年我们会得什么病，或者无法在我们得病时消除我们的所有痛苦，但我们仍乐于接受他们所能提供的帮助。	Our maladies are largely random, and even if our doctors cannot tell us which ones we will have in the next year, or eliminate all of our suffering when we have them, we are happy for the help that they can provide.
但日本的经济前沿绝不仅限于亚洲合伙太平洋，而是要延伸到拉丁美洲和非洲，因此，我们更应该抛弃长期以来的内向角度。	But Japan’s economic frontiers extend well beyond Asia and the Pacific, to Latin America and Africa – more reason to abandon our long-held inward-looking perspective.
一战后，国际社会实施了所谓的《毒气协议 》 （ Gas Protocol ） ， 禁止使用化学武器和生物武器。	After World War I, the international community adopted the so-called Gas Protocol, to prohibit the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons.
这一观点认为，如果不存在可让渡的生产性资料个人所有权，就无法找到充分的激励追求发展政策，而共同资源 （ “ 共有物 ” ） 将被过度利用和低效使用。	Absent alienable individual ownership of productive resources, it is asserted, there will be insufficient means and incentives to pursue development initiatives, and shared resources (the “commons”) will be over-exploited and used inefficiently.
澳大利亚、新西兰和加拿大分别为27 % 、 28 % 、 和20 % ， 这部分要归因于这些国家积极的移民政策。	In Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, it is 27%, 28%, and 20%, respectively, a consequence in part of these countries’ activist immigration policies.
在这一点上，卡钦斯基正在模仿他的偶像，两次世界大战之间的波兰领袖约瑟夫·毕苏斯基（尽管这位“波兰第一元帅”确实曾经两次担任总理 ） 。	In this, Kaczyński is emulating his idol, the interwar leader Józef Piłsudski (though the “First Marshal of Poland” did go on to serve as prime minister twice).
正如英格兰银行马克·卡尼（Mark Carney，我猜他也听了默多克的演讲）在今年早些时候所言 ， “ （未经）深思熟虑的市场原教旨主义可能毁灭对资本主义本身的长期活力至关重要的社会资本 。 ”	As the Bank of England’s Governor Mark Carney (who I assume also heard Murdoch’s lecture) remarked earlier this year, “[U]nchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself.”
当前经济状况的逻辑意味着政府应该利用超低利率的时机来投资于可以刺激需求和改善经济结构的基础设施项目。	The logic of current economic conditions implies that governments should be taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to invest in infrastructure projects, which would both stimulate demand and improve the structure of the economy.
毕竟，他将向穆勒的检察官们提供与弗拉基米尔·普京总统关系密切的某些俄罗斯寡头的罪证 — — 这些人对敢于背叛他们的人从不特别温和。	After all, he would be giving Mueller’s prosecutors the goods on some Russian oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin – folks who are not particularly gentle toward people who betray them.
感染了牛海绵状脑病却没有明显症状的个体对其它人构成了威胁，有可能通过输血或手术造成变异型克雅氏病的二次传染。	Individuals infected with BSE who remain in an asymptomatic state during their lives could represent a risk to others of potential secondary transmission of variant CJD through blood transfusion or surgery.
这一方法帮助许多世界级超级企业崛起，也给劳动力市场和社会带来了严重问题，因为它摧毁基于旧技能的中层岗位的速度快于基于新技能的同等岗位的创造速度。	As this approach facilitates the rise of global super-firms, it creates serious problems for labor markets and societies, because it destroys mid-level jobs based on old skills faster than comparable jobs based on new skills can be created.
此外，随着发达经济体竞争力日益提高，以及中国在价值链中地位的攀升，更多的投入品需要在各国国内就地解决。	And, as advanced economies become more competitive, and as China moves up the value chain, more inputs are being sourced within countries.
她还援引了印度教与自然世界的深刻联系来说明“河流崇拜，山丘崇拜，树木崇拜”是“印度的文化遗产 ” 。	“River worship, mountain worship, tree worship,” she said, invoking Hinduism’s deep connections to the natural world, “is India’s cultural heritage.”
疲软的增长已经降至2 % （ 在2010年有过短暂的反弹 ） ， 产出出现大规模负缺口，这表明总就业情况的恢复将非常缓慢，在这种情况下，各国仍采取了收紧财政政策。	Fiscal policy was being tightened when growth was languishing below 2% (after bouncing back in 2010), and sizeable negative output gaps suggested that overall employment would be slow to recover.
如果特朗普真的关注国家安全，那么令人奇怪的是，美国为什么不将地下矿石指定为抵抗未来敌对行动的战略储备。	If Trump really is concerned about national security, then one wonders why the US is not keeping ore in the ground as a strategic reserve for future hostilities.
更加多元化的马哈拉施特拉邦的奥兰加巴德（Aurangabad）城市集群是不少印度最大的种子公司的所在地，拥有活跃的汽车、制药和糖生产行业，同时也是旅游枢纽，坐落着阿旃陀（Ajanta）和艾洛拉（Ellora）石窟。	The more diversified Aurangabad cluster, in Maharashtra, is home to some of India’s largest seed companies, an active automotive, pharmaceutical, and sugar-manufacturing industry, and a tourism hub that includes the Ajanta and Ellora caves.
相反，美国容许在以色列政府缺乏任何行动的情况下出现一个政治真空，而如今这个真空就被“阿拉伯觉醒”所填补了。	Instead, the US allowed a political vacuum to form in the absence of any movement on the part of Israel’s government. This vacuum has now been filled by the Arab Awakening.
但鉴于包括共同文化或环境 — — 或随机因素 （ “ 基因漂变 ” ） 在内的多重原因均可造成某种特质随时间推移发生可以衡量的变化，因此证明这种现象的研究非常罕见。	But, given that measurable alterations in a trait over time can occur for many reasons – including those related to shared culture or environment – or randomly (“genetic drift”), studies demonstrating this phenomenon are rare.
不仅他是如此：在每一个伟大的帝国背后，都有一位伟大的哲学家和历史学家，他的世界观推动帝国带着合法性甚至神圣性前进。	And he was not unique: behind every great empire has been a great philosopher or historian whose worldview imbued the imperial drive with legitimacy and even sacred significance.
这将导致英国国会中支持脱欧的英国独立党的兄弟党派五星运动（Five Star Movement）上台掌权。	That could bring to power the Five Star Movement, a partner of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party in the European Parliament.
这些新技术实现了个人赋权 — — 特别是给快速增长的年轻人口 — — 也让经济和社会发展走上了康庄大道。	These new technologies empower people – most notably the rapidly growing youth population – and create new avenues for economic and social development.
成功需要每年投入6,000亿美元，涉及到的领域包括环境修复和保护、可再生能源和能源效率，以及可持续交通系统。	Success will require an estimated $600 billion in investment each year, in areas including environmental remediation and protection, renewable energies and energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation systems.
从1985到1995年雅克·德洛尔任委员会主席以来，再也没有有远见或政治影响力的领袖担任过委员会主席职务。	Not since Jacques Delors was President of the Commission, from 1985 to 1995, has that position been filled by a leader with any vision or political clout.
黎巴嫩潜在的碳氢化合物财富的确可以协助这个国家完成转型，同时为中东其他能源生产国提供一种模式用于参照。	Lebanon’s potential hydrocarbon wealth could indeed transform the country, as well as providing a model for other Middle Eastern energy producers to follow.
如果唯一的结果是降低其外交政策的可靠性和可预见性 — — 甚至更糟，招致别人的误解 — — 那么答案当然是不需要。	If the outcome is to make its foreign policy less reliable and predictable – or, worse, susceptible to misunderstanding – then it certainly does not.
左翼意识形态（特别是在英国）更多地来源于某些基督教道德传统 （ “ 比马克思更加卫理公会 ” ） 而非任何政治教条。	Left-wing ideology, especially in Britain, owed more to certain Christian moral traditions (“more Methodist than Marx”) than to any political dogma.
但仍有八个国家没有签署全面禁止核试验条约，这使该条约无法产生效力，其对全球安全的作用也没有纳入核安全峰会的日程。	Yet the failure of eight countries to ratify the CTBT has prevented it from entering into force, and its contribution to global security has so far not been included on the NSS agenda.
奥斯汀，德克萨斯—四百年前，约翰·罗尔夫（John Rolfe）用从西印度群岛偷来的烟草种子发展出弗吉尼亚州第一宗盈利的出口生意，扰乱了西班牙加勒比海殖民地的烟草贸易。	AUSTIN, TEXAS – Four hundred years ago, John Rolfe used tobacco seeds pilfered from the West Indies to develop Virginia’s first profitable export, undermining the tobacco trade of Spain’s Caribbean colonies.
同样，阵亡抚恤金仅仅是50万美元，大大低于死亡的一生全部经济成本的标准估计。 有时也把它称作生命的统计学价值（在610万美元到650万美元之间 ） 。	Similarly, payments for those who are killed amount to only $500,000, which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death, sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ($6.1 to $6.5 million).
美国和其他很多发达国家的模式则恰好相反，随着其国内生产及出口资本密集度的提升，他们的经常账户余额均出现了恶化。	This pattern contrasts with that of the United States and many other advanced countries, which have experienced a deterioration of their current-account balances as their production and exports have become more capital-intensive.
但美国回归亚洲中心舞台的风光面临着中国战略雄心的制约，其充当亚洲主要安全锚所要面对着诸多关键性的挑战。	But the heady glow of America’s return to center stage in Asia has obscured key challenges in remaining the region’s principal security anchor in the face of China’s strategic ambitions.
真相是传统西方列强尽管有诸多共同点，但在许多方面仍然是多样化的，从能源政策 — — 欧洲碳氢化合物依赖远大于美国 — — 到安全莫不如此。	The truth is that the traditional Western powers, despite having plenty in common, diverge in many areas, from energy policy – Europe is far more dependent on hydrocarbons than the US – to security.
在邻国也门陷入一场代理战争僵局的沙特人高兴地看到特朗普正在考虑增加援助来驱逐伊朗侵占其战略后院的行动。	The Saudis, bogged down in a proxy war with Iran in neighboring Yemen, are elated that Trump is contemplating an increase in assistance to repel Iranian encroachment from their strategic backyard.
意大利和西班牙等传统天主教欧洲国家有自由堕胎法，但拉丁美洲仍保留着最虔诚的信仰，保持着这个世界最严格的法律禁忌。	While traditionally Roman Catholic European countries like Italy and Spain have liberalized their abortion laws, Latin America has remained true to the faith, maintaining some of the world’s strictest legal prohibitions.
伦敦 — — 马琳·勒庞，法国极右翼国家阵线领袖声称爱国主义和全球主义之战将成为21世纪一场决定性的战争。	LONDON – Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Front, claims that the twenty-first century’s defining battle will be between patriotism and globalism.
而欧盟则提供这一套共同规则，通过共同的机构，让每一个国家 — — 即使是最小的 — — 都能有发言权。	The EU provides this set of common rules, buttressed by common institutions that give every country, even the smallest, a say.
但那些刚刚遭遇房价泡沫爆破的国家则不太会产生另一场房价泡沫,因为趋向保守的政府政策可能会减少对住房的补贴，而这些国家当前的市场气氛似乎也无法催生泡沫。	But another housing bubble is not imminent in countries where one just burst. Conservative government policies will probably reduce subsidies to housing, and the current mood in these markets does not seem conducive to a bubble.
士气低落的问题缺乏善意和体面；这是习俗和礼仪的失败，是社会目标的缺失，是辨别对错以采取正确行动的能力或意愿的减弱。	Low morale results from too little kindness and decency; it is a failure of custom and manners, a loss of social purpose, a diminution of the ability or the will to distinguish right from wrong and then to act rightly.
再回到我们先前的类比，街头的帮派不能攫取政治权力，但他们肯定能将使所在的街区置于危险、落后和可怕的状态。	To return to the analogy, urban street gangs cannot seize political power, but they can certainly keep their neighborhoods dangerous, backward, and grim.
丰裕家庭花费收入和财富的比例较低，因此，不平等性的升高会带来总体消费水平的降低，从而制约已不堪总需求不足重负的经济复苏。	Given that affluent households spend a smaller share of their incomes and wealth, greater inequality translates into lower overall consumption, thereby hindering the recovery of economies already burdened by inadequate aggregate demand.
安卡拉—如果我们真的生活在“地球村”中，通过商业、金融和社会联系彼此，那么某地非正式经济活动就真的会对其他地方产生消极影响。	ANKARA – If it is true that we live in a “global village,” bound to one another through commercial, financial, and social ties, then it is also true that informal economic activity in one part of the world has a negative impact elsewhere.
相对1995—2007年趋势的累计产出损失，目前美国为GDP的78 % ， 欧元区为GDP的60 % 。	Cumulative output losses relative to the 1995-2007 trends now stand at 78% of annual GDP for the US, and at 60% for the eurozone.
他是产业政策的坚定鼓吹者，这将会让他与欧盟委员会和其他许多领导人产生巨大的对立。 他还深深地不信任金融市场，还经常主张更多的监管。	He is a staunch advocate of industrial policies, which will lead him into sharp confrontation with the European Commission and many of his colleagues.
其实有玩笑认为默克尔会像战后德国首任领袖康拉德·阿登纳一样终身担任总理职务（德国并没有设立任期限制 ） 。	Indeed, as with postwar Germany’s first leader, Konrad Adenauer, there are jokes about Merkel being Chancellor for life (Germany has no term limits).
通常发生的情况是，新闻圈根据先入为主地认定观众和读者喜欢什么，而不是根据他们实际喜欢什么来采取行动。	Very often, the news cycle is driven by assumptions about what viewers or readers might like, rather than what they actually want.
让作为税收替代的能源税尤其作为防务措施具有吸引力的地方是，它在让欧洲更为安全、环保而且富有的同时保持福利国家毫发无损。	What makes the energy imposed as a tax substitution tax particularly attractive as a defense measure is that it leaves the welfare state intact while making Europe safer, greener, and richer.
这一决定在法国（包括���社会主义者之间）仍有争议，但奥朗德很明白，以欧洲防务政策之孱弱是断然无法与北约抗衡的。	That decision remains controversial in France, including among Socialists, but Hollande is well aware of the weaknesses of a European defense policy that simply cannot compete with NATO.
这意味着官方增长率没有反映与空调、抗癌药物、新手术流程以及其他许多普通创新一起到来的真实收入的提高。	That means that the official growth rate does not reflect the rise in real incomes that came with air conditioning, anti-cancer drugs, new surgical procedures, and the many more mundane innovations.
摩根大通首席财务官玛丽安妮·莱克（Marianne Lake）表示，这笔罚款中有大约70亿美元可以适用于税收扣减，也就是说，被当作必要的常规经营费用处理。	Marianne Lake, JP Morgan’s chief financial officer, has suggested that about $7 billion of the fine is likely to be tax deductible, that is, treated as a form of necessary and usual business expense.
此外，69%的人认为美国在阿富汗战争后面临的恐怖主义威胁并未减弱，而71%的人表示伊拉克的经验表明美国应该更加谨慎地使用武力。	Moreover, 69% do not believe that the US is safer from terrorism since the war in Afghanistan, and 71% say that the experience in Iraq shows that the US should take greater care in how it uses force.
既然有这些新科技，生产率也即将大幅度提高，为何还有这么多人继续认为所有人都必须更多地工作、更晚地退出才能让经济保持竞争力？	Why, with all this new technology and imminent productivity increases, do so many continue to argue that everyone has to work more and retire much later in life if economies are to remain competitive?
土耳其对伊拉克北部地区实施的有限的军事打击除开会使伊拉克当局作出公开谴责和口头宣称伊拉克的主权外，不会再引起其他反应。	A limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty.
与列宁恶化社会条件将加速革命的信条如出一辙，Hojatieh认为，暴力、冲突和压迫升级将促成马赫迪的归来。	Akin in some ways to Lenin’s doctrine that worsening social conditions would hasten revolution, the Hojatieh believe that only increased violence, conflict, and oppression will bring the Mahdi’s return.
评论员苏利文（Andrew Sullivan）说 ： “ 我看到了我第一眼看到的那个人 … … 我看到了我自以为了解的总统 。 ”	As the commentator Andrew Sullivan put it, “I saw the person I first saw...I saw the president I thought I knew.”
第二天，他的这番话被广泛报道；但听众的行为只字未提，让读者产生了首相完全是主动向日本公民爆粗口的印象。	The next day, his words were reported widely; the behavior of the crowd, however, was not, leaving readers with the impression that their prime minister had, completely unprompted, yelled coarsely at Japanese citizens.
大多数人需要一个社会定义，但将这一定义依附在一座城市之上显然要比依附在一个全副武装并打算与敌人发生冲突的国家身上更好。	Most people need a communal identity, but it may well be better to find it in one’s attachment to a city than in attachment to a country that is armed and willing to engage in conflict with enemies.
因此，个性化用药的影响从短期看有利于病患方，但用大量临床试验来证明新药的安全性将给制药方带来巨大的开发成本。	Thus, the impact of personalized medicine in the short term might be positive at the patient’s bedside, but vast clinical trials to demonstrate the safety of new drugs will impose huge development costs that manufacturers might never recover.
为什么神经学家、分子生物学家、遗传学家和发展生物学家—这些以科研成果永久地改变了我们对自身的认识的男性和女性—对他们的未来却如此彷徨不安？	Why are neuroscientists, molecular biologists, geneticists, and developmental biologists – men and women whose discoveries have forever changed the way we understand ourselves – so uneasy about their futures?
若将新鲜食物剔除出物价指数，则通胀率将升至0.9 % ， 但若将能源剔除，通胀率将降至0.3 % 。	When fresh food is excluded from the price index, the rate rises to 0.9%, but falls to 0.3% when also excluding energy.
在“地球中心的王国”衰落了几个世纪之后，正在骄傲地崛起，恢复它曾经拥有的辉煌。 与此同时，俄罗斯也在跃跃欲试地企图恢复从前的帝国地位，但这似乎注定不会成功。	Whereas the “Middle Kingdom” is proudly regaining its former global status after centuries of decline, Russia is defiantly trying to resurrect its former imperial status, but in a manner that appears doomed to fail.
广义上说，租金作为一种收入形式，完全来源于对资产的所有权和控制权，而不是对经济资源的创新和创业型部署。	Rent, broadly defined, is income derived solely from the ownership and control of an asset, rather than from innovative, entrepreneurial deployments of economic resources.
EITC也获得了广泛的支持（在美国经济学会进行的调查中，四分之三的受访经济学家支持扩大EITC ） 。	The EITC also has broad backing (more than three-quarters of economists surveyed by the American Economic Association support expanding it).
建立欧洲“银行联盟”需要德国的首肯。 银行联盟意味着向欧洲央行让渡监督权，并建立一个清算倒闭银行的共同基金。	Germany’s consent was needed to create Europe’s “banking union,” which entailed the transfer of supervisory powers to the European Central Bank and the creation of a common fund to resolve failing banks.
虽然有一些多边发展银行和开发融资机构融资可被用于早期基础设施投资 — — 包括中国的丝路基金，世界银行以及联合国国际金融公司 — — 但这类融资的供应却受到了需求不足的拖累。	Although some MDB and DFI financing is available for early-stage infrastructure investment – including from China’s Silk Road Fund, the World Bank, and the International Finance Corporation – the supply of such financing is dwarfed by demand.
在这样的情形下，经济将逐渐疲软，使皇室难以继续收买中产阶级支持，让东部和南部的反对派有能力打击政府的权威。	In such a scenario, the economy would gradually weaken, hampering the royal family’s ability to continue buying middle-class support, while enabling rebel groups in the east and the south to erode the government’s authority.
当然，如果历史能够提供任何借鉴，那么我们可以了解实现从国家统治到执行监管的转变是一个十分困难的过程。	Of course, if history is any indication, the shift from a dirigiste state to a regulatory one will not be easy.
各种各样的性别歧视让女性处于性奴役、人口买卖、包办婚姻的风险之下，剥夺了女性不可侵犯的权利，也破坏了生命的平等性。	In all of its forms, gender discrimination makes women vulnerable to sexual slavery, trafficking, and forced marriage, deprives women of their inalienable rights, and diminishes their quality of life.
事实上，特朗普的煽动及不停谴责媒体是“人民公敌”的模式已经令很多人深信其追随者有可能针对新闻媒体从业人员发起暴力行动。	In fact, Trump’s pattern of incitement and routine denunciations of the media as “the enemy of the people” had convinced many that some of his followers might resort to violence against members of the press.
在几乎所有努力折戟沉沙之后，国际外交已经越来越多地被有关制裁的探讨所取代 — — 人们热衷于讨论如何运用制裁和谈判两种方式来迫使伊朗就范。	With just about every diplomatic effort failing to yield results, international efforts have increasingly given way to discussions about sanctions – and what mix of them would be needed to bring Iran to heel.
如今学生债务存量高达1.2万亿美元，其中超过60%由收入最低的四分之一家庭（即净财富少于8,500美元的家庭）承担	It now stands at well over $1.2 trillion, more than 60% of which is held by the bottom quartile of households (those with a net worth of less than $8,500).
出人意料的是，低三种选择的修正版 — — 104名巴勒斯坦囚犯将在谈判的各阶段被释放 — — 最终促成了谈判重启。	Unexpectedly, a modified version of the third option – whereby 104 Palestinian prisoners will be released in phases over the course of the negotiations – ultimately facilitated the resumption of talks.
然而讽刺地是，刚掌权的民主反对派却想恢复Burma这个名字，因为他们视Myanmar这一名字为独裁的象征 — — 而这正是他们想摒弃的东西。	Ironically, however, the newly empowered democratic opposition would like to bring back the name Burma, viewing “Myanmar” as emblematic of the dictatorship that they wish to leave behind.
这出剧写于欧洲三十年战争期间。 这场十七世纪上半叶的战争摧毁了欧洲，直到1648年签订威斯特伐利亚和约（Peace of Westphalia）才宣告结束。	The play is set during Europe’s Thirty Years’ War, which devastated Europe in the first half of the seventeenth century, ending only with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.
甚至有观点认为同性恋因为“非自然”所以是错误的，甚至是“对我们性能力的扭曲 ” ， 而性能力按理只能为生育的目的而存在。	Sometimes it is claimed that homosexuality is wrong because it is “unnatural,” and even a “perversion of our sexual capacity,” which supposedly exists for the purpose of reproduction.
印度的耻辱溃败加速了其总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁（Jawaharlal Nehru）的死亡，但它也促进了这个国家的军事现代化和政治崛起。	India’s humiliating rout hastened the death of its prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru; but it also set in motion the country’s military modernization and political rise.
每当上一代统治者兑现掌权的非法收益，都会引发继任者更为强烈的掠夺欲望，他们害怕轮到自己掌权时利益已经被瓜分殆尽。	As each preceding generation of rulers cashes in its illicit gains from holding power, the successors are motivated by both the desire to loot even more and the fear that there may not be much left by the time they get their turn at the trough.
纽黑文—美联储试图退出其非常规货币政策，这一政策面临着一对矛盾：它成功地阻止了经济灾难，但没能铸就强健的经济复苏。	NEW HAVEN – As the US Federal Reserve attempts to exit from its unconventional monetary policy, it is grappling with the disparity between the policy’s success in preventing economic disaster and its failure to foster a robust recovery.
例如，纳西姆·尼古拉斯·塔勒布（Nassim Nicholas Taleb）在他2004年出版的书《被随机性愚弄的傻瓜》中提到经济科学 ： “ 你可以用方程式来掩盖自己的把戏，没有人能够揭穿你，因为没有东西可以进行对照实验。	For example, in his 2004 book Fooled by Randomness, Nassim Nicholas Taleb said of economic sciences: “You can disguise charlatanism under the weight of equations, and nobody can catch you since there is no such thing as a controlled experiment.”
伦敦 — — 35年前，作为全球考察的一部分，查尔斯·伯顿和我途经北极穿越北冰洋，之后在一块快速移动的冰盖上露营了三个月。	LONDON – Thirty-five years ago, as part of a global expedition, Charles Burton and I traveled across the Arctic Ocean via the North Pole, camping for three months on a fast-moving ice floe.
总之，中国必须将重点从实现GDP增长目标转向营造促进创新与竞争的环境，从而允许市场制定价格并提高资源分配效率。	In short, China must shift its focus from meeting GDP growth targets to creating an environment that fosters innovation and competition, thereby enabling market forces to set prices and allocate resources more effectively.
但这也无法确保塔利班会动用武力阻止他们的基地组织盟友在阿富汗境内重组武装力量，并利用这些力量对其他国家发动新一轮恐怖袭击。	But it is hard to imagine the Taliban using force to prevent their al-Qaeda allies from reestablishing a military presence in Afghanistan and exploiting that presence to organize additional terrorist attacks in other countries.
但消灭无法使用且维护价格昂贵的核武器是很容易实现的目标 — — 是我们能够轻松把握和消除的风险因素。	But nuclear weapons, unusable and extremely expensive to maintain, are low-hanging fruit – a risk that we can easily grasp and eliminate.
除此之外，在北方邦旅游部门发行的本地主要旅游景点手册也将泰姬陵这个该州（以及该国）的主要旅游目的地排除在外。	Furthering this erasure, the Uttar Pradesh tourism department issued a brochure of the state’s main attractions, but left out the Taj Mahal, the state’s (and the country’s) main tourism destination.
在特朗普总统任期第一年与朝鲜独裁者相互辱骂时，那个国家的核计划已经稳步向前推进，而美国也距离违背所有人意愿的战争越来越近。	While the president spent his first year in office trading insults with the dictator of North Korea, that country has moved steadily forward with its nuclear program, and the United States has moved steadily closer to a war that no one wants.
特朗普政府最近公布了一份十年预算计划，被批缺少连贯性，也没有给出明确的税收政策。 这样的批评非常中肯。	The administration recently released a ten-year budget plan that has been rightly criticized for its lack of coherence and its failure to describe explicit tax policies.
此外，有些国家的政府债务负担同欧洲边缘国家的债务负担一样大，甚至更大，美国和日本就是两个最好的例子。	Moreover, there are countries with government-debt burdens that are as large, if not larger, than those on Europe’s periphery – the United States and Japan being prime examples.
这一计划意味着克里姆林宫将为卡德罗夫 — — 开始是艾哈迈德·卡德罗夫，在他死后，便是他的儿子，拉姆赞·卡德罗夫 — — 提供广泛的自治权力（但不能名义独立）和巨额资金。	The plan implied that the Kremlin would provide the Kadyrovs – first Akhmad Kadyrov, and then, after his death, his son, Ramzan – broad autonomy (independence in all but name) and huge sums of money.
发达和贫穷国家都有大量例子，不负责任的盈利性学校糊弄家长、忽视学生（唐纳德·特朗普的伪善的特朗普大学就是其中之一 ） 。	There are abundant examples, in rich and poor countries alike, of fly-by-night for-profit schools that dupe parents and neglect students (Donald Trump’s sham Trump University being a case in point).
由于气候变化的影响，非洲正在经历1945年来最严重的干旱，尤其是在南苏丹、索马里、埃塞俄比亚和北尼日利亚等地区。	Owing to the effects of climate change, Africa is experiencing its worst drought since 1945, especially in Southern Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Northern Nigeria.
文化的“零点”是重要的，因为它们构成了一条分割线 — — 泾渭分明的“之前”和“之后 ” — —给私人和公共生活的发展造成了根本性影响。	Cultural “zero points” are important because they serve as a dividing line – a clear demarcation of “before” and “after” that holds fundamental implications for the development of private and public life.
某些经济学家，包括我本人在内，的确警告过在现有的管理、稳定及合法化市场制度的边界以外推进经济全球化的后果。	Some economists, including me, did warn about the consequences of pushing economic globalization beyond the boundaries of institutions that regulate, stabilize, and legitimize markets.
已经有证据表明，女记者开始自我审查，不再撰写某些问题的报道，特别是基于权利的问题和影响到边缘群体的问题。	Already there is evidence that women are self-censoring and drawing back from writing about certain issues, specifically rights-based issues and those affecting marginalized communities.
美国总统特朗普去年夏天在勃兰特下跪的纪念碑前发表了演讲，受到了波兰公众的热烈响应，原因就在于他没有偏离PiS所认可的叙事。	US President Donald Trump’s speech in Warsaw last summer was well received by the Polish public precisely because he did not deviate from the PiS-endorsed narrative.
科罗拉多大学波尔德分校（University of Colorado, Boulder）的凯西·费斯勒（Casey Fiesler）正在探索这一试验方法，他将以科技伦理为主题的课程大纲进行众包。	Casey Fiesler of the University of Colorado, Boulder, is pursuing just such experimentation by crowd-sourcing syllabi focused on tech ethics.
然而，即使是来自联合国的最悲观的预测也预期发展中国家的普通民众在2100年时会比现在更富裕，也因此能更好的应对这一挑战。	However, by 2100, even the most pessimistic forecasts from the UN expect the average person in the developing countries to be richer than now, and thus better able to cope.
阿亚图拉Mesbah Yazdi频频与艾哈迈迪内贾德一同在公开场合露面，他负责Hojatieh学会，许多什叶派将该学会视为极端分子。	Led by Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, who frequently appears with the Ahmadinejad, the Hojatieh society is considered by many Shia as the lunatic fringe.
为了保护欧洲公司从哈瓦那酒店中赚取的利润，欧盟将会停止邀请思想开放的人士来到使馆，并会按照独裁者及其附庸们的脸色来判断他们究竟是什么人。	To protect European corporations’ profits from their Havana hotels, the Union will cease inviting open-minded people to EU embassies, and we will deduce who they are from the expression on the face of the dictator and his associates.
而用超宽松货币政策来抵消财政紧缩又要冒风险 — — 在发达国家这意味着私人杠杆卷土重来，而在新兴经济体已经出现危险的杠杆上升溢出状况了。	But offsetting fiscal austerity with ultra-easy monetary policies risks fueling a resurgence of private leverage in advanced economies and already has produced the dangerous spillover of rising leverage in emerging economies.
RIGA — — 欧盟委员会不帮助所有欧盟成员国实现各自的《京都议定书》目标，反而将本应共同分担的责任推到最新成员国头上。	RIGA -- Instead of helping all EU member states to meet their own Kyoto goals, the European Commission is shifting what should be a shared burden onto its newest members, which are already the most environmentally efficient in the European Union.
显然，诗人兼哲学家保罗·瓦勒里（Paul Valéry）是正确的 ： “ 未来和其他所有东西一样，不再会与昨日相同 。 ”	Clearly, the poet and philosopher Paul Valéry was right: “The future, like everything else, is no longer what it used to be.”
但是，对大部分健康男性来说，美国预防服务专职小组（USPSTF ） — —由预防和初级治疗专家组成的独立领导小组 — — 公开反对普及PSA测试。	For most healthy men, however, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) – a leading independent panel of experts on prevention and primary care – has publicly recommended against widespread PSA tests.
潘基文还可以表明在当今世界恐怖主义的存在是没有正当理由的，这里的恐怖行动指的是国际上为了政治意图而对平民故意造成伤害的行为。	Ban can also make the case that there is no justification in today’s world for terror – defined here as the intentional harming of civilians for political purposes.
在共产党执政的最后几周里，马佐维耶茨基推动建立了谈判实现政治过渡的模式，这种模式直到今天依然为巨变中的其他社会提供信息、指引和激励。	In the final weeks of Communist rule, Mazowiecki helped to establish a model for negotiated political transition that still informs, inspires, and guides other societies on the cusp of change.
此外目前美国玉米产量的40%都已经用作提炼乙醇，而几年前这一比例还仅有5%左右，这意味着玉米价格必须提高以应对市场对食品，出口和乙醇生产的需求。	In addition, the fact that nearly 40% of the US corn crop is being used for ethanol, up from around 5% a few years ago, means that corn prices must be higher to meet the feed, export, and ethanol demands for corn.
在凡尔赛会议上，欧洲四大经济体 — — 德国、法国、意大利和西班牙 — — 支持由它们组成统一的核心的多速方针。	At a meeting at Versailles, the EU’s four largest economies – Germany, France, Italy, and Spain – endorsed a multi-speed approach that would establish them as a unified core.
具体地讲，我们需要同步推进有利于增长的结构性改革、加强需求管理、解决过度负债问题并改善地区和全球政策框架。	What is needed, in particular, is simultaneous progress on pro-growth structural reforms, better demand management, addressing pockets of excessive indebtedness, and improving regional and global policy frameworks.
不幸的是，我的许多同僚 — — 特别是编教科书的那几位 — — 将物理学描绘成一座壮丽无瑕的万丈高楼，却忽视了这个由众多古怪模型所构成的理论大杂烩其实早已千疮百孔。	Unfortunately, many of my colleagues – particularly those who write textbooks – present physics as a towering, seamless basilica, ignoring the gaps in our hodge-podge of skewed models.
选民们因为否决像“跨太平洋伙伴关系 ” （ TPP）这样的新自由贸易协议及重新谈判像北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）这样的已有协议而兴奋不已。	Voters were galvanized by the prospect of rejecting new free-trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and renegotiating old ones like the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
幸运的是，即使布什不明白这些基本准则，美国的法庭却是明白的，虽然它只是马后炮地迫使它的政府遵守这些条例。	Fortunately, even if Bush does not understand such basic principles, America’s courts do, and they are now, albeit belatedly, forcing his administration to abide by them.
这种情况往往预示着（通胀调整后）实际工资的上涨，这表明在脆弱的后危机复苏时代，落后的许多美国工人可能最终从强劲的经济增长中尝到甜头。	Such conditions usually foreshadow rising real (inflation-adjusted) wages, which would indicate that American workers, many of whom were left behind in the anemic post-crisis recovery, might finally reap benefits from the strong economy.
但阿拉伯地区需要的是基于项目的微观导向大手笔治理投资，这必须以商业环境的深度改革为条件，该地区的商业环境被公认为世界最差。	But what the Arab region needs are micro-oriented, project-based, and governance-heavy investments conditioned on deep reform of a business environment that is generally considered among the worst in the world.
为此他呼吁将欧元打造为“一个新的、更具主权意义的欧洲的工具 ” ， 并承诺要“推出一些加强欧元国际作用的举措 ” 。	He then called for the euro to become “the instrument of a new, more sovereign Europe,” and promised to “present initiatives to strengthen the international role of the euro.”

在这个问题上，自安倍经济学的第一支箭射出以来，日本已创造超过270万个工作岗位，并因此取得了重大的成功。	Here, Japan has been tremendously successful, creating more than 2.7 million jobs since the first arrow of Abenomics was launched.
苏丹自身的挑战在于改革整个石油行业，后者多年来遭到中国和马来西亚企业残酷和不负责任的开发，造成了灾难性的环境后果。	Its own challenge lies in reforming the entire oil industry, which for years has been brutally and irresponsibly exploited by Chinese and Malaysian companies, with devastating environmental consequences.
根据维也纳公约第22条 ， “ （外交）使团驻地神圣不可侵犯 ， ” 且“驻地所在东道国不能进入，除非有外交使团首脑允许 。 ”	According to Article 22 of the Convention, “the premises of [a diplomatic] mission shall be inviolable,” and a “receiving state may not enter them, except with the consent of the head of the mission.”

遗憾的是，国际法律和管辖的全球系统还太弱小，如果世界最强大国家的总统决意独自跳起战争，上述体系阻止不了他的一意孤行。	Unfortunately, the global system of international law and governance remains too weak to prevent the determined misbehavior of the president of the world's most powerful country if he is hell bent on starting a war on his own.
即使在后来的两次减税中 — — 1986年里根的第二期财政计划和2001年小布什的减税政策 — — 净国民储蓄率平均也有4.2 % ， 比当前水平高出一倍有余。	Even during the two tax cuts that followed – the second installment of Reagan’s fiscal program in 1986, and the initiatives of George W. Bush in 2001 – the net national saving rate averaged 4.2%, more than double the current level.
目前的全球经济危机是一个机遇，可以让我们进行新的试验，不仅可以解决这一危机，而且或许可以建立某些机制来帮助防止未来的危机。	The current global economic crisis is an opportunity for some new experimentation that might not only lead to its resolution, but might also set in place institutions that help to prevent future crises.
在过去两个世纪中，世界在降低婴儿死亡率方面取得了重大进展，普通妇女不再需要将生命中的五年时间用来怀孕，再将十年时间用来哺乳。	Over the past two centuries, the world has made significant strides in reducing infant mortality, such that the typical woman no longer has to spend five years of her life pregnant and another ten years nursing.
这不仅是对国际法的粗暴违反；也直接有悖于俄罗斯再三强调的任何国家都没有权利牺牲他国保证自身安全的说辞。	This was not only a gross violation of international law; it also directly contravened Russia’s oft-stated insistence that no country has the right to ensure its security at the expense of another.
（特朗普本人也参与了一场在空军一号上举行的会议，当时他正从上任总统后的第二次出访中回国，会议起草了一份掩盖特朗普大厦会晤内容的声明。 ）	(Trump himself participated in a meeting aboard Air Force One, as he returned from his second presidential trip abroad, to draft a statement to cover up what happened in that Trump Tower meeting.)
公共部门和私人部门 — — 单独行动以及大规模、长时间的合作 — — 需要以更严肃的态度思考如何对劳动力的再培训和再武装、增强劳动力流动性、职业培训和实习。	Both the public and private sectors – individually and through scalable and durable partnerships – need to think much more seriously about labor retraining and retooling programs, enhanced labor mobility, vocational training, and internships.
在卢旺达，GBD研究揭示，用固体燃料烹饪造成室内空气污染是主要致死原因，政府据此制定了一个计划，为最脆弱家庭提供了一百万只清洁炉灶。	In Rwanda, when the GBD study revealed that indoor air pollution from cooking with solid fuel was a leading cause of death, the government launched a program to distribute one million clean stoves to the most vulnerable households.

但1997年亚洲金融危机后，收入差距开始在整个地区拉大，印尼尤其严重，社会福利计划对于阻止不平等性的加剧几乎毫无作用。	But, since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, income gaps have widened throughout the region, and in Indonesia in particular, where social welfare programs have barely stemmed the rise in inequality.
佩雷茨的战略可能是从左翼政党争取选民，但是工党几乎肯定会失去中间派别选民（以及那些视国家安全为首要任务的人士）的支持而流向沙龙。	Peretz’s strategy may draw voters from other parties on the left, but Labor will most likely lose centrist voters (and those for whom national security is paramount) to Sharon.
印度尼西亚最近发生了两件戏剧性的释放事件：一是一位激进的穆斯林教士被从监狱里释放了出来，另一件是一份漂亮的男性杂志被投入了市场。	Indonesia recently witnessed a pair of dramatic releases: one a radical Muslim cleric from prison, the other a saucy men’s magazine from its editors.
在暴力驱逐独裁者索莫扎（Anastasio Somaza）后掌权的社会主义革命家，需要借助基督教上帝获得合法性，真实咄咄怪事。	That a socialist revolutionary – who first came to power after violently ousting the dictator Anastasio Somoza – should seek legitimacy in a Christian god is odd.
从20世纪80年代初到21世纪第一个十年中期，沙特阿拉伯一直是泛阿拉伯政坛的协调者，利雅得和吉大的宫殿吸引着整个阿拉伯世界的政治领袖。	From the early 1980’s to the mid-2000’s, Saudi Arabia was the coordinator of pan-Arab politics, with the palaces of Riyadh and Jeddah drawing political leaders from throughout the Arab world.
如果一个旨在促进繁荣和欧洲进一步整合的系统一直都导致了适得其反的效果，那么友好分手就比当前的僵局更好。	A system intended to promote prosperity and further integration has been having just the opposite effect. An amicable divorce would be better than the current stalemate.

他自身的利益，不论是身体还是道德上的，都不足以成为（受到权力约束）的原因 … … 他有权支配自己的身体和思想。	His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant....Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.
对印度和中国而言，基于化石燃料的经济发展轨迹可能会带来灾难，因为其庞大人口的巨额需求可能激化地缘政治紧张。	For India and China, an economic trajectory based on fossil fuels could spell catastrophe, as efforts to secure enough for their immense populations ratchet up geopolitical tensions.
更有甚者，德国央行（Bundesbank）仍然死抱住从德国惨痛的通胀经历中总结出来的过时的货币学说。	To make matters worse, the Bundesbank remains committed to an outmoded monetary doctrine rooted in Germany’s traumatic experience with inflation.
而且在这次争斗同时，美国派遣海豹突击队在深入巴基斯坦境内的一栋建筑中找到本·拉登，而且只在袭击行动结束后才通知了巴基斯坦政府。	And, in the midst of this tussle, the US sent Navy Seals to find Bin Laden at a compound deep in Pakistani territory, informing Pakistan’s government only after the raid was over.
持续60年的残酷镇压甚至都难以让西藏和新疆认同这一点，这从2008年的西藏人和2009年的维吾尔人爆乱中可以得知。	Six decades of ruthless repression has failed to win China acceptance even in Tibet and Xinjiang, as the Tibetan and Uighur revolts of 2008 and 2009 attested.
真相是，是布什 — — 他让美国陷入了阿富汗和伊拉克战争 — — 在2008年签署了部队地位协定（Status of Forces Agreement ） ， 根据该协定，美国要在三年内撤出所有驻伊拉克美军。	The truth is that it was Bush who, having plunged the US into war in Afghanistan and Iraq, in 2008 signed the Status of Forces Agreement that allotted three years to withdraw all US troops from Iraqi territory.
首先是W玻色子和Z玻色子的质量。 W玻色子和Z玻色子是弱相互作用的介质，比如阳光照射就是有它们传递的。	The first was the masses of the W and Z bosons – the messengers of the weak nuclear interactions, responsible, for example, for the shining sun.
北方牧场信托组织帮助牧民群体建立其赖以生存的有效环境治理机制，减少因为放牧权所引发的冲突，尤其是在干旱时期。	NRT has helped pastoralist communities establish effective governance mechanisms for the environment on which they depend, reducing conflict over grazing rights, especially in times of drought.
与一直在将战略“支点”从一个地区转向另一个地区的美国不同，中国正在实施从“国家间政治”向“网络间政治”的再平衡，着重于“连通”而非“控制 ” 。	Unlike the US, which has been engineering a strategic “pivot” from one geographic region to another, China is rebalancing from “politics among nations” to “politics among networks,” focusing on “connectivity” rather than “control.”
美国共和党总统候选人赫尔曼·凯恩的“999”计划呼吁在实行9%的个人及企业税率的同时，实行9%的国家销售税率。	In the US, the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain’s “9-9-9” plan calls for a 9% rate for personal and corporate taxes, together with a new 9% national sales tax.
事实上，这也许来的正是时候 — — 发达经济体人口老龄化意味着未来几十年中劳动力将减少 — — 而个人护理需求将增加。	In fact, this may come just in time – an aging population in developed economies implies a smaller workforce – and greater need for personal care services – in the coming decades.
美国学者约翰·贾沃尔（John Garver）用中国寓言很好地描述了这一局面 ： “ 青蛙在温吞水中感觉舒适又安全。	The American academic John Garver depicted it best using a Chinese fable: “A frog in a pot of lukewarm water feels quite comfortable and safe.
在巴基斯坦白沙瓦以南的克哈特（Kohat）区，在女接种员的帮助下，未接种儿童从30,000人下降到22,000人，拒绝接种的儿童数量也从月4,000人下降到400人。	In the Pakistani district of Kohat, south of Peshawar, female vaccinators have been credited with helping to lower the number of unvaccinated children from 30,000 to 22,000, and to reduce the number of vaccine refusals from around 4,000 to 400.
而统计方法错误和捏造事实的更惊人例子是哈佛经济学家卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）最为广泛引用的断言 — — 如果一国债务对GDP比率超过90 % ， 其经济增长会大幅度放缓。	An even more spectacular example of a statistical error and sleight of hand is the widely cited claim of Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that countries’ growth slows sharply if their debt/GDP ratio exceeds 90%.
像巴库提这样的当地法塔赫领袖掌握着民族主义武装的制高权力，它们组成了 “阿克萨烈士旅”这样的松散型组织。	Local Fatah leaders like Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of the Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades.
在整个非洲，中等学校和TVET系统正在实现转型，准备好用完成学生到工作者和参与度更高的公民的转变所必须的技能，来武装非洲的年轻头脑。	Across the continent, secondary schools and TVET systems are transforming themselves to prepare Africa’s young minds with the skills they need to make the transition from school to employment, and to become more engaged citizens.
三权分立，是美国建国领导人在Montesquieuz这样的哲学家的影响下建立起来的治国纲领。 但这一原则现如今将美国领向了几近瘫痪的状态。	The separation of powers, a principle established by the US founders under the influence of philosophers such as Montesquieu, is leading today to near-paralysis.
OUN在纳粹拒绝乌克兰独立后便与之决裂，最终与苏联人以及德国人被赶走后的波兰共产主义和反共产主义地下运动武装都有斗争。	The OUN broke with the Nazis after they denied Ukraine independence, and finally fought the Soviets and both the army of Communist Poland and the anticommunist Polish underground after the Germans were routed.
2015年，欧盟的DAC成员国将ODA预算中的97亿美元用在了各自国家的大约120万名寻求庇护者身上。	In 2015, the European Union’s DAC member states spent $9.7 billion of their ODA budgets on approximately 1.2 million asylum-seekers in their own countries.
此外，由于许多可再生能源技术是建立在已开采金属和矿物的基础上，因此全球矿业将在朝向低碳未来的转型中扮演关键角色。	Moreover, because many renewable energy technologies are built with mined metals and minerals, the global mining industry will play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon future.
但即使石油和天然气田几乎在2017年立即完成拍卖，而后成功得到开发，由此所产生的收入最早也要到2022年才会实际抵达。	But even if oil and gas blocks are auctioned off almost immediately, in 2017, and then successfully explored, the resulting revenues would not arrive until 2022 at the earliest.
对于6个月前开始的主席任期，听惯了布莱尔“充满热情的亲欧洲人士”的漂亮口号，这恐怕是一个令人哀伤的结局。	It is a sad conclusion to a presidency, launched six-months ago, with Blair’s claim that he was a “passionate pro-European”. Yet the full text of his speech tells it all.
鉴于经济增长缓慢、失业率居高不下（仅仅因为心灰意冷的工人退出就业大军失业率才有所降低）和通胀率远低于联储目标，现在并不是开始限制流动性的最好时机。	Given slow growth, high unemployment (which has fallen only because discouraged workers are leaving the labor force), and inflation well below the Fed’s target, this is no time to start constraining liquidity.
但欧洲央行的权力是欧元区所缺失的民主政治制度的技术替代物这一事实将是2013年的一个继续发酵的问题。	But the fact that the ECB’s power is only a technocratic substitute for the eurozone’s missing democratic political institutions will remain a growing problem in 2013.
由于这些对中国领导层不利的故事极为敏感，因此这些广受欢迎的报道通常被禁止，编辑因此被撤职，刊登或播报它们的媒体通常受到处罚。	Owing to great sensitivity about stories that cast China’s leadership in a bad light, these popular reports are frequently banned, editors are fired, and media outlets that publish or broadcast them are often punished.
发自新德里 — — 在经历了数十年国际制裁下的孤立和贫困之后，缅甸近来摇身一变成为了希望明灯和亚洲的潜在新亮点。	NEW DELHI – Isolated and impoverished by decades of international sanctions, Myanmar (Burma) has emerged in recent months as both a beacon of hope and a potential new Asian flashpoint.
过去20年来，世界直接外资的流量发生了迅猛的增长，从20世纪80年代的400亿美元一路飙升到了去年的9000亿美元。	World flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have soared over the past two decades, from $40 billion in the early 1980’s to $900 billion last year.
大约六年间，葛兰运动分子一直协助艾尔多安驱逐那些不肯忠于其柔性伊斯兰主义，却对土耳其世俗和民族主义理想宣誓效忠的军队、警察和其他公共部门干部。	Over the course of roughly six years, the Gülenists had helped Erdoğan to oust military and police cadres (among many other public-sector employees) who were loyal to Turkish secular and nationalist ideals, rather than to his own soft Islamism.
该党和由奥斯卡尔·拉方戴内领导的社会民主党异议人士结盟，鼓吹同样激进的提议。 由于左右两翼政府对失业大潮均无计可施，越来越多的法德两国选民似乎不再相信传统的解决方案。	With the evident failure of both leftist and rightist governments to stem the rising wave of unemployment, a growing part of the French and German electorates no longer seems to believe in traditional solutions.
首先，进步的政治经济必须基于对资本主义的坚定信念 — — 即基于大部分资产为私有、主要由市场指导生产和分配收入的经济体系。	First, a progressive political economy must be based on a firm belief in capitalism – that is, on an economic system in which most of the assets are privately owned, and markets largely guide production and distribute income.
海啸发生之后，美国和其它一些富裕国家似乎完全来得及重新考虑他们的援助计划，并有可能对那些最需要救济的国家追加援助资金。	In the wake of the tsunamis, it seems possible that the US and other wealthy countries will rethink their assistance programs and, possibly, step up their aid to those most in need.
此外，过去十年来意大利的经济增长一直很慢，而且看不到加速的迹象，这使得意大利即使实施了财政整合也很难降低公共债务负担。	Moreover, economic growth has been slow for the past decade, and is not accelerating, which will make it difficult to lower the public-debt burden even with fiscal consolidation.
换句话说，如今希腊已经实现了零初级预算赤字，如果其名义增长率超过其政府债务的平均利率，则其债务负担将会降低。	Stated differently, now that Greece has achieved a zero primary budget deficit, its debt burden will decline if its nominal growth rate exceeds the average interest that it pays on its government debt.
但是现在人们普遍认为，美国发动战争的谈判方式是一个错误 — — 这一错误使美国作为谈判一方失去了大量的信誉。	But it is now widely accepted that the way in which the US negotiated its way into war was a mistake – one that has cost it enormous credibility as a negotiating partner.
欧洲没有了萨科齐或者贝卢斯科尼，也没有了英国前首相撒切尔夫人，德国前总统赫尔穆特·科尔以及西班牙前首相何塞·玛丽亚·阿斯纳尔这样的人。	Europe has no Sarkozy or Silvio Berlusconi, but also no Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl, or José Maria Aznar.
他们指出，二战以来，如若危机爆发，则在信心危机结束、经济恢复增长后还将平均持续4.4年 — — 这是必须的“去杠杆化”所需要的时间。	They reckon that the average length of post-war crises has been 4.4 years – the time it takes for the necessary “de-leveraging” to occur – after which the crisis of confidence is over and economic growth revives.
“如果我们要在世界上实现真正的和平 ， ” 圣雄甘地在1931年、即英联邦成立前近二十年时说 ， “ 就必须从教育开始 。 ”	“If we are to reach real peace in this world,” Mahatma Gandhi said in 1931, nearly two decades before the Commonwealth was established, “we shall have to begin with the children.”
此外，尽管朝鲜一再破坏区域和平，但中国对这个流氓政权却给于无条件支持，这也是导致其他国家对中国是否认真对待其邻国的国家安全有所保留的重要原因。	China’s unconditional support for North Korea’s wayward regime, despite its repeated crimes against peace, is also a cause for concern about whether China will treat its neighbors’ security concerns with respect.
若要实现这一点，莫格里尼必须把自己当作受容克和欧洲理事会主席唐纳德·塔斯克（Donald Tusk）支持的领导者。	For that to happen, Mogherini must assert herself as a leader, backed by Juncker and the new European Council president, Donald Tusk.
身为一个在道德上和政治上都被宣传所腐蚀的国家 — — 苏联的前公民，我很清楚“新闻”武器化会造成什么伤害。	As a former citizen of a country – the Soviet Union – that was morally and politically corrupted by propaganda, I am well aware of the damage that can be done by weaponized “news.”
考虑到他在2003年多么不得人心，很多人认为他愿意交出权力，但需要找到确保他名声（和财产）的继任者。	Knowing the extent of his unpopularity in 2003, many believe that he was ready to leave power but needed a successor who would ensure that his legacy (and his wealth) survived.
他们联合起来反对像世界贸易组织（WTO）这样的多边机构，世贸组织是拥有准司法争端解决机制的唯一国际机构，也是谈判和执行全球贸易规则的主要论坛。	They rally against multilateral bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO) – the main forum for negotiating and implementing global trade norms and one of the only international organizations with a quasi-judicial dispute-settlement entity.
社会民主政府不断面临着财富的重新分配严重阻碍了经济增长的指责，并且无法使选民们相信为高等教育的另一次大扩张注入资金是有必要的。	Social-democratic governments have been on the defensive against those who claim that redistributing wealth exacts too high a cost on economic growth, and unable to convince voters to fund yet another massive expansion of higher education.
如果因此引发了自己支持者的反对，他会提醒他们民族团结和互相尊重、而不是狭隘的党派斗争，最终会使宇宙的道德之弧进一步倾向于公正。	And when his own supporters objected, he reminded them that national unity and mutual respect, not narrow partisanship, would eventually bend the moral arc of the universe toward justice.
比如说，如果一位首席执行官不可能赚取超过其企业普通员工收入一定倍数的收入，那么他花在损公肥私这件事上的精力也会有所限制。	If, for example, it becomes impossible for a CEO to earn more than a certain multiple of what the average worker in his or her firm is paid, there will be a limit to how much ingenuity the CEO directs toward pure self-enrichment.
低估的汇率只是各国用以推动出口并限制进口的政策之一。 实施这样的政策使得该国享有贸易顺差而其贸易伙伴们（包括美国）则出现逆差。	Undervalued exchange rates are only one of the policies that countries use to boost exports and restrain imports, so that they run trade surpluses, while their trading partners (including the US) run deficits.
伊斯兰国发言人坚持一字不差地奉行先知穆罕默德及其早期追随者制定的原始戒律，完全不为任何情况做出任何调整。	The Islamic State's spokesmen insist on following the original precepts laid down by the Prophet Mohammed and his earliest followers, understood literally and with no adjustment for different circumstances.
有力证据表明其潜在的危害程度远远大于食品污染物或杀虫剂残留物。 而在法律的制约下，后两者已经降到了很低的水平。	The strength of evidence and the potential magnitude of harm greatly exceed those of food contaminants or pesticide residues, which are appropriately regulated to very low levels.
比如，2月底，德国总理默克尔做出了令人惊讶的坚持：欧洲不需要加固其金融防火墙来保护其他欧元区国家免受希腊的无序违约。	At the end of February, for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a spectacle insisting that no bigger financial firewall was needed to protect other eurozone countries from a disorderly Greek default.
埃及的主要盟国美国差一点支持抗议群众，同时要求穆巴拉克政府在兑现“改善民主”承诺的同时，立即采取措施满足群众的合理要求。	The United States, Egypt’s main ally, while stopping short of siding with the protesters, is holding the regime to Mubarak’s promise of a “better democracy,” and demanding swift action to meet the people’s legitimate demands.
我们必须从个体和集体角度解决人工智能和生物技术等方面的尖端研究所带来的道德和伦理问题。 新科技将大大延长寿命，实现定制婴儿和记忆提取。	We must address, individually and collectively, moral and ethical issues raised by cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, which will enable significant life extension, designer babies, and memory extraction.
第一个是长期的不充分就业不仅伤害了目前也伤害了潜在的产出 — — 通过腐蚀失业人员的“人力资本 ” 。	First, prolonged unemployment destroys not just current but also potential output by eroding the “human capital” of the unemployed.
资源“从有直接用途的当年商品和服务上”如此大规模的“转移 ” ， 我指出 ， “ 只有在它能提振年度总体经济增长0.3%以上，或在25年时间里提振6 % ， 它才是划算的买卖 。 ”	Such a massive diversion of resources “away from goods and services directly useful this year,” I argued, “is a good bargain only if it boosts overall annual economic growth by 0.3% – or 6% per 25-year generation.”
但是，尽管在没有替代方案的情况下，这一脱钩可能持续一段时间，但金融市场表现和大部分人的福利之间的巨大差异不可能长期维持。	But, while this disconnect could continue for some time if no alternative program emerges, the huge gap between financial markets’ performance and most people’s well-being is unlikely to persist in the longer term.
更糟糕的是，大家知道就业的每一个方面都有这样那样的法律或规定，这种想法对工作岗位有害无益，使人无意尝试通过务实的方式解决问题。	Worse yet, the knowledge that some law or regulation covers every aspect of employment poisons the workplace and discourages attempts to resolve problems pragmatically.
近代早期的意大利纺织工人发觉他们的银币工资缩水了，而他们的产品仍然在国际奢侈品市场上保持坚挺的金币价格。	Early modern Italian textile workers would find their pay in silver reduced, while their products still commanded a gold price on the international market for luxuries.
虽然这个例子告诉我们军事政治领导人在袭击核反应堆前应当会三思后行，但仅仅是乌克兰核设施的庞大规模就需要全球更多的注意力。	While that case provides some assurance that military and political leaders will think twice about attacking nuclear reactors, the sheer scale of Ukraine’s nuclear enterprise calls for far greater global concern.
中国的高层人士很快从国际经验中认识到应对企业债务问题将会限制短期经济增长和增加社会成本 — — 例如失业。	Influential voices in China are quick to draw the lesson from international experience that tackling corporate debt can limit short-term growth and impose social costs, such as unemployment.
你也许认为乌克兰人对欧洲式民主理想的英勇决心会给他们带来大量西方支持，帮助他们抵抗俄罗斯的入侵和经济动荡。	One might have expected the heroic commitment of Ukrainians to Europe’s democratic ideals to trigger a rush of Western support for the country in its battle against Russian aggression and economic instability.
但那种更为细致精妙的政策制定 — — 通常基于企业可以被信任或引导去进行自我规管的错误假设 — — 已经失败了。	But more nuanced policymaking – often based on the misguided assumption that companies can be trusted, or induced, to self-regulate – has failed.
除非我们承认并解决这一现实，否则过去七十年来为世界带来了前所未有的和平与繁荣自由世界秩序将继续土崩瓦解。	Unless and until we recognize and address this reality, the liberal world order that has brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to the world over the past seven decades will continue to erode.
同样，雷诺汽车公司54%的股东，其中包括法国政府，在今年4月举行的企业年度股东大会上对CEO卡洛斯·戈恩2，500万欧元（合2，800万美元）的薪酬方案投了反对票。	Similarly, 54% of Renault SA’s shareholders, which include the French state, opposed CEO Carlos Ghosn’s €25 million ($28 million) remuneration package at the company’s AGM in April.
如果你将这些形象与打扮成体面的英国律师但充满了不安全感的年轻甘地的照片相比较，就会发现他深谙符号沟通之道。	If one compares those images with pictures of the young, insecure Gandhi dressed as a proper British lawyer, one can see how carefully he understood symbolic communication.
在穆加贝辞职后，中国外长不遗余力的赞扬“中国和津巴布韦之间的友谊 ” ， 而姆南加古瓦肯定会延续这样的关系。	Following Mugabe’s resignation, China’s foreign ministry went out of its way to praise the “friendship between China and Zimbabwe,” and Mnangagwa can be expected to continue that relationship.
典型的美国家庭知道现在的状况比四年前糟糕了许多，他们并不认为针对高收入群的减税政策真的带来了布什政府所预先承诺的好处。	The typical American family knows that it is worse off today than it was four years ago, and appears unconvinced that the tax cuts targeted at upper-income Americans brought the benefits heralded by the Bush administration.
菲格雷斯的食肉客驱逐计划像是一场运动，它是有害的，因为它表明这位联合国前气候主管眼中只有禁止自己不喜欢的行为，而其依据则是不堪一击的证据和夸大其词的报纸报道。	Like much campaigning, Figueres’s plan for meat-eaters is disturbing, because it suggests that the former UN climate chief is focused on banning behavior she doesn’t like, based on flimsy evidence and over-the-top newspaper reporting.
在我的第一次后1989年中国之旅中，一个酒吧间男服务员向我介绍了一个明确反映新的官方精神的习语 ： “ 没有运动，什么都可以 ” （ 只要没有政治运动，干什么都可以 ） 。	During my first post-1989 trip to China, a bartender introduced me to a phrase that perfectly characterized the new official mood: “Meiyou yundong, shenme dou keyi” (As long as there are no political movements, anything goes).
事实上，在美国这类资本充裕的国家，更多的进口（主要为劳动密集型产品）会提高资本回报率，从而推动国际资本流入该国。	And, indeed, in a more capital-abundant country like the United States, more imports (of mostly labor-intensive products) would raise the returns on capital, creating an incentive for international capital to flow to the country.
在这个快速变化的时代，教育和技能培训应当与贸易和产业等政策相协调，这样才能更有机会满足新兴的劳动力市场需求。	At a time of rapid change, education and skills training should be coordinated with, say, trade and industrial policies to improve the chances that emerging labor-market requirements will be met.
一场完美风暴正在外汇市场上形成。 这一风暴威胁到把欧元升值到令即使欧元区最为具有效率的国家德国无法在世界市场竞争的水平。	A perfect storm is forming in the foreign exchange markets that threatens to catapult the euro to levels that will make even the euro-zone’s most efficient exporter—Germany—unable to compete in world markets.
但这正是奥巴马的另一个非同寻常之处：他身份的复杂性使他具有真正的世界性，成为全球化时代的一位全球化候选人。	But that is another reason why Obama is exceptional: the complexity of his identity makes him truly universal, a global candidate for a global age.
心理学研究表明这三点当中的任何一点都可以很有说服力，而说服力的大小取决于演讲者的魅力以及听众自身的倾向性。	Psychological research has shown that any one of these three can be persuasive, depending on the speaker’s attractiveness or the audience’s predisposition.
但它们都不能不关注一个重要目标：制定一个新政策框架，这个框架要基于存在的共同利益，能够阻止关系的恶化、稳定欧洲-大西洋安全。	But none should distract attention from the important goal of identifying a new policy framework, based on existential common interests, that can stop the downward spiral in relations and stabilize Euro-Atlantic security.
最后，我们可以运动、共和国前进运动以及动力运动（Momentum，帮助科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn）改组英国工党平台的青年运动）都不是因为它们是“运动”而重要。	In the end, Podemos, La République En Marche!, and Momentum, the youth movement that helped Jeremy Corbyn reshape the British Labour Party’s platform, are not important because they are movements per se.
摩索尔是当今反叛力量的主要据点，伊拉克军队驻在那里的一位营长阿里说 ： “ 没有美国人，我们根本不可能控制伊拉克 。 ”	As Iraqi Colonel Omar Ali, the Iraqi battalion commander in Mosul, the main focus of the insurgency today, recently put it, “Without the Americans, it would be impossible for us to control Iraq.”
恰恰相反，这是法国耗时 15 年最终实现与北约和解 — — 以及欧洲防务所取得的实质性进展 — — 的产物。	Rather, it is the product of a 15-year process of rapprochement with NATO – and of the real progress being achieved in European defense.
逊尼派神职人员刚刚宣布要对“伊朗政权、真主党及其宗派盟军”开战圣战，这是穆斯林世界几百万人民的声音。	The Sunni clerics who have just declared a jihad against “the Iranian regime, Hezbollah, and its sectarian allies” are the voice of millions across the Muslim world.
在同意提高消费税的时候，反对派的自由民主党坚持要着手解决造成预算赤字的罪魁祸首 — — 日本退休人员的社会保障和福利开支。	In reaching the agreement to raise the consumption tax, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party insisted that the main squeeze on the budget deficit – the amount spent on social-security benefits for Japan’s retirees – begin to be addressed.
吸引市场人才加入中国庞大的官僚体系的一个关键点是政府高层需要鼓励下属果断独立的政策执行并容忍善意的决策失误，让有才干的官员在面对不确性而作出实时决定时不会有太大压力。	The key to attracting market-oriented talent to China’s large bureaucracy is to make it clear that risk-taking – and even failure – will be tolerated.
局部范围（有时候也出现大规模的）的冲击波，会引起海底斜坡上的海底沉淀物发生滑动倾泻，诸如大陆架斜坡上的海底沉淀物。	Locally, but sometimes still at a grand scale, the shock waves cause major sediment slides on steep underwater slopes such as those of the continental shelves.
从外部看，这里的公司散发着一种特权的味道 — — 比如在扩张进入全世界各大城市 — — 不管是柏林还是里约热内卢 — — 时藐视当地监管。	Viewed from outside, the world sees companies that exude a sense of entitlement – for example, by flouting local regulations as they expand into cities around the world, from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro.
斯瓦蒂·查图尔维迪（Swati Chaturvedi）在其2016年的自白书《我是一个“喷子 ” ： 印度人民党数字义勇军内幕 》 （ I Am A Troll: Inside the Secret World of the BJP’s Digital Army）中透露，印度人民党在印度国内外建立了许多报酬丰厚的水军，每人都操纵多个账号。	As Swati Chaturvedi explained in her 2016 exposé I Am A Troll: Inside the Secret World of the BJP’s Digital Army, cyber cells of well-paid trolls, each operating multiple accounts, have been established in India and abroad.
不幸的是，许多政府已经无力管理他们所释放的力量，而企业领导人也已丧失了责任感，不再关注为他们创造繁荣环境的社会福利制度。	Unfortunately, many governments had already lost the capacity to manage the forces they had unleashed, and business leaders had lost their sense of responsibility for the welfare of the societies within which they were flourishing.
布鲁塞尔—美国总统特朗普和中国国家主席习近平在刚刚结束的布宜诺斯艾利斯G20会议上达成暂时休战，双方都获得了一些时间思考问题之所在。	BRUSSELS – The temporary truce reached by US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the just-concluded G20 meeting in Buenos Aires should give both sides some time to reflect on the issues in question.
考虑到如此严重的危险，停止进一步核竞赛、消除全世界15,000发核武器存量所带来的风险符合所有国家的利益。	Given the grave dangers, it is in every country’s interest to halt further nuclear competition and eliminate the risks associated with the world’s remaining stockpiles of some 15,000 nuclear weapons.
每天，专家们都对伊拉克叛乱、玻利维亚古柯种植、欧洲央行和北朝鲜政治局等各种各样的问题发表高见，但我们对他们的意见到底应该相信多少？	Every day, experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European central bankers, and North Korea’s Politburo. But how much credibility should we attach to the opinions of experts?
事实上，尽管美国总统奥巴马显然渴望结束这一毫无意义的外交冻结，但一些右翼美国政客似乎宁可在佛罗里达州以南存在一个劣等国家而不是潜在伙伴。	Indeed, despite President Barack Obama’s apparent desire to end the pointless diplomatic freeze, some right-wing US politicians would, it seems, prefer a pariah to a potential partner off Florida’s coast.
他不是普通的美国总统，并且，借用《大西洋 》 （ The Atlantic）的塞伦娜·齐拓（Salena Zito）的话，必须认真对待特朗普，但不要从字面上理解他。	He is no ordinary US president, and he must be taken seriously, though not literally, to borrow a phrase from The Atlantic’s Salena Zito.
葛兰分子也因此可以将其玩弄于股掌之上 — — 比方说，保证军方有破坏力的泄密（其中最惊人的往往是捏造的）会在自由媒体首先发布。	And it allowed the Gülenists to play them – for example, by ensuring that damaging leaks from the military (the most egregious of which were fabricated) would be published in liberal outlets first.
类似地，欧元区在2008年金融危机后的恢复也受到严格财政规则的掣肘，这些规则规定成员国财政赤字水平不能超过GDP的3 % 。	Likewise, the eurozone’s recovery from the 2008 financial crisis has been held back by strict fiscal rules that limit member countries’ fiscal deficits to 3% of GDP.
但由军队占统治地位的政治系统排斥这类参与，因此随着经济不断增长，政治的去军队化成为所有大型军管穆斯林国家 — — 从印尼到地中海沿岸 — — 的群众呼声。	Military-dominated political systems precluded such participation, so, with economic growth, demilitarization of politics became a rallying cry in all large military-led Muslim states, from Indonesia to the Mediterranean coast.
在这方面，中国和沙特阿拉伯堪称杰出 — — 尽管它们绝不是“孤家寡人 ” — —组织了一系列日益厚颜无耻的绑架或让批评者失踪。	Here, China and Saudi Arabia stand out – though they are by no means alone – for orchestrating a series of increasingly brazen abductions or vanishings of their detractors.
为了更好地贯彻IMF双重宗旨的另外一半，IMF已经释出信号，表明它将增募资金，从2009年4月伦敦G20会议上通过的7500亿美元增加到1万亿美元。	In order to better carry out the other half of its dual mandate, the IMF has signaled that it will ask for a further increase in its resources, to $1 trillion, up from the $750 billion agreed at the London G-20 meeting in April 2009.
福格的策略被推广到东尼日利亚，然后又引入西非的其他地区，最终应用到最具挑战性的环境：拥有五亿人口的印度。	Foege’s strategy was extended to eastern Nigeria, then introduced to other parts of West Africa, and ultimately applied to the most challenging environment of all: India, with its half-billion people.
这个世界晚宴上最受青睐的演讲嘉宾包括右翼共和党人士德克萨斯前州长里克·佩里，佩里曾经把同性恋和酗酒相提并论。	Favored speakers at This World galas include the right-wing Republican former governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who once compared homosexuality to alcoholism.
在英国，扭转肥胖趋势可以让全国医保（National Health Service）每年节约约12亿美元。	In the UK, reversing obesity trends could save the National Health Service about $1.2 billion a year.
全世界只有不到一半的学龄难民儿童有学可上；有不到1/4的人能上到中学；不到1％的人可以继续接受高等教育。	Fewer than half of school-age refugee children worldwide attend school; not even one in four make it to secondary school; and under 1% go on to pursue a higher education.
正如伊曼纽尔·坎特（Immanuel Kant）在很久之前所指出的那样，实行民主制度的国家一般都不愿互相攻伐，因此应该推动民主以实现和平。	Because, as Immanuel Kant noted long ago, states with democratic political systems tend not to fight with each other, democracy should be encouraged in order to secure peace.
而他们对此的回应则涵盖对指标测量方式，劳动力市场结构转变，潜在性的投资机会缺乏，稀释生产率的技术创新以及技术导致的技能错配等问题。	Their response covers concerns about measurement, structural shifts in the labor market, a potential paucity of investment opportunities, productivity-diluting technological innovations, and technology-driven skills mismatches.
和许多学界和发展界人士一样，我也是全球化的最大受益者之一 — — 我们能够将我们的服务在比我们的父辈所能想象的更大更富有的市场上出售。	Like many in academia and in the development industry, I am among globalization’s greatest beneficiaries – those who are able to sell our services in markets that are larger and richer than our parents could have dreamed of.
鉴于美国财政赤字庞大，中国正在推行宽松财政和信贷政策，欧洲仍处于复苏之路，当前的全球扩张势头可能会持续到明年。	The current global expansion will likely continue into next year, given that the US is running large fiscal deficits, China is pursuing loose fiscal and credit policies, and Europe remains on a recovery path.
"40美元一桶的油价预计会使全球潜在产出的长期年增长率降低近01 . % ，而60美元一桶的油价将会""可衡量的""全球潜在产出长期年增长率降低近0.3 % 。"	"At $40 a barrel, expect oil prices to slow the long-run growth rate of the world's potential output by 0.1% per year. At $60 a barrel, expect the ""measured"" long-term rate of potential world output growth to slow by roughly 0.3% per year."
过去20年来，土耳其取得了令人瞩目的经济成就，从欧洲病夫一跃成为欧洲最具活力的经济体之一和新的中东贸易中心区。	Over the past two decades, Turkey has made remarkable economic strides, transforming itself from Europe’s sick man into one of its most vibrant economies and a new center of gravity for trade in the Middle East.
这也许还没有到达欧洲央行“低于但接近2 % ” 的目标，但显然无法论证欧洲央行日益激进地动用货币工具刺激经济。	This may fall short of the European Central Bank’s target of “below but close to 2%,” but not by a margin substantial enough to justify the ECB’s increasingly aggressive use of monetary instruments to stimulate the economy.
"对""叶利钦式民主""的失望推动普京总统寻找以民族主义和国家荣誉为基础的全新意识形态，这被普京称为""管理下的多元论 。 """	"Disillusion with ""democracy Boris Yeltsin-style"" has pushed President Vladimir Putin to search for an ideology based on nationalism and the glorification of the state. Putin calls it ""managed pluralism."""
尽管这些政策或有助于价格稳定，但他的方案忽略了巴西央行问题最重要的两个方面：法律自主权和保证公民问责权的制度改革。	While such policies may promote price stability, his proposal neglects the two most important issues for the BCB: legal autonomy and institutional reforms that ensure accountability to citizens.
六四危机，通过团结党领导层的重新团结以及党和城市人民之间的团结的重新建立，巩固了中国共产党的统治，并加速了目前这一轮中国经济高速发展的势头。	By reunifying the Party leadership and re-establishing solidarity between the Party and the urban population, the crisis consolidated CCP rule, and accelerated China’s momentum down its current path of rapid economic growth.
以色列的袭击获得了开门红，而哈马斯也因成功地用导弹袭击了特拉维夫感到欢欣鼓舞，这一成就让真主党在2006年黎巴嫩战争中的成果相形见绌。	Israel’s assault scored impressive initial successes, while Hamas can take pride in having reached Tel Aviv with its missiles, an achievement that eluded Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon War.
有鉴于此，阿拉伯的国家主义政府们认为抗拒严肃的政治改革是完全必要的，而压制国内的反对派，特别是日长夜大的伊斯兰主义运动也是合情合理的。	As a result, Arab nationalist governments feel justified in resisting serious political reform and vindicated in repressing all domestic opposition, particularly the swelling Islamist movements.
监管也好，分业经营也好，大部分银行业改革方案仍然停留在纸上作业阶段，金融游说集团一定会竭尽所能削弱它们的功效。	Whether relying on regulation, or gesturing towards institutional separation, most proposals for banking reform remain at the drawing-board stage, and are sure to be emasculated by financial lobbies.
伊斯兰国信奉原教旨主义的瓦哈比派思想，他们极度嗜血，目标是回归想象中的前现代哈里发帝国，征服什叶派并将非穆斯林打为二等公民。	Powered by a fundamentalist Wahhabi ideology and a boundless appetite for bloodshed, the Islamic State seeks a return to an imagined pre-modern caliphate that subjugates Shia and treats non-Muslims as second-class citizens.
他们还可能合理地得出结论，他未能将其部分福克斯新闻台的薪金导入401(K)账户，是针对他所述语言的极为有力的论证。	And they might reasonably conclude that his failure to channel some of his Fox News salary into a 401(k) account is a very powerful argument against the words coming out of his mouth.
如果该党能获得45%以上的国内选票，那么依据土耳其选举法的奇怪规定，就能在550个议会席位中拥有代表超过330个。	If the party is able to secure more than 45% of the national vote, the quirks in Turkey’s electoral law will give it more than 330 representatives in the country’s 550-seat legislature.
只有合作能带来和平，摆脱无用、危险、终将破产的新军备竞赛 — — 这次包括网络武器、空间武器和下一代核武器。	Only cooperation can deliver peace and the escape from a useless, dangerous, and ultimately bankrupting new arms race, this time including cyber-weapons, space weapons, and next-generation nuclear weapons.
但是，如果阿根廷获得足够投资建设让瓦卡穆尔塔页岩资源盈利所需要的基础设施 — — 管道、铁路、石英矿和废物站 — — 阿根廷有可能会因为充分开采而受困。	Yet, if Argentina receives sufficient investment to build the infrastructure – the pipelines, railways, silica mines, and waste sites – needed to make Vaca Muerta profitable, the country may become effectively locked into full exploitation.
我们观察到，大部分涉及到的机构 — — 贝尔斯登（Bear Stearns ） 、 雷曼兄弟（Lehman Brothers ） 、 房利美以及GSE房贷美（Freddie Mac ） 、 AIG、华盛顿互惠银行（MaWu）和美联银行（Wachovia ） — —都没有被格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案所覆盖，这让人怀疑它的向心性。	The observation that most of the institutions involved – Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae, the GSE Freddie Mac, AIG, WaMu, and Wachovia – were not covered by Glass-Steagall calls into question its centrality.
我们相信只要激励措施得当，基础设施对那些拥有长期负债的机构而言完全可以成为创新且有吸引力的资产类别。	We believe that with the right incentives, infrastructure can be an innovative and attractive asset class for those with long-term liabilities.
最为重要的是，对预先宣告的争议表明在欧洲央行的管理委员会中，迫切需要一致精神和权力分享精神的重新兴起。	More than anything, the pre-announcement controversy demonstrates that a renewed spirit of consensus and collegiality in the ECB’s Governing Council is sorely needed.
不幸的是，变异型克雅氏病在加拿大、法国、爱尔兰、意大利、日本、荷兰、葡萄牙、沙特阿拉伯和美国的发病率也逐年上升。	This unfortunately has been accompanied by increasing number of variant CJD cases in Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and the USA.
这些观点认为，对经济大萧条和二战后年代中的工业化经济体而言，这些养老金体制是不错的，但是，在当今高科技、网络化以及后工业化经济体中，他们已经落伍了。	These programs were fine, the argument goes, for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the post-World War II generation, but they have become obsolete in today’s high-tech, networked, post-industrial economy.
不仅如此，真正意义上的技术执政将建立一支有官僚管理经验的健全的公务员队伍，利用大数据来衡量和优化福利政策。	Moreover, a real technocracy would boast a robust civil service trained in bureaucratic management techniques that use data to measure and optimize welfare.
如果那是我们想要的未来，我们应该意识清醒地向这一目标大踏步前进。 我们不能漫无目的地乱逛直到落入陷阱，之后才抬起头来，迷迷糊糊地不知道怎么会这样。	If that is the future we want, we should stride toward it with full awareness and a sense of purpose, not meander carelessly until we fall into a hole, look up, and wonder how we got there.
无奈事与愿违，不但冒出了一个悬浮议会（英国政治术语，意指在英国下议院选举中无任何政党赢得总共650个席位中的半数以上 ） , 还可能导致今年晚些时候再来一场大选。	It ended up doing the opposite, producing a hung parliament and the likelihood of another general election later in the year.
像壳牌的专家一样，埃克森公司的科学家预测海平面将破坏性上升，并警告美国中西部和世界其他地区可能会变为沙漠。	Like Shell’s experts, Exxon’s scientists predicted devastating sea-level rise, and warned that the American Midwest and other parts of the world could become desert-like.
但是，尽管这两个条件在9月初都已实现，FOMC仍决定保持利率不变，给出的解释是其担忧全球经济环境，特别是中国的情况。	But, although both conditions were met earlier in September, the FOMC decided to leave the rate unchanged, explaining that it was concerned about global economic conditions and about events in China in particular.
上述理念同样无法承受不被民众理解、国内政客也不愿承担责任的规章和行动所招致的对欧盟机构的不可避免的攻击。	Nor can it withstand the inevitable attacks directed against EU institutions for every action and regulation that citizens dislike and for which national politicians want to avoid responsibility.
在欧洲，危机的根源来自于一个单一政治联盟的缺位，因为这是分担债务并以此将欧元构筑在一个合理基础之上的必要前提。	In Europe, the absence of a political union – considered a necessary precondition for sharing debt obligations and, thus, putting the euro on a sound footing – is widely held to lie at the root of the continent’s crisis.
尽管这一方案明确了日本利用欧战并且在欧洲各国在东南亚取得立足点的愿望，但是它并未明确说明谁是日本的真正敌人。	Although it made clear Japan’s desire to take advantage of the European conflict and gain a foothold in the European colonies in Southeast Asia, the plan was not clear about who constituted Japan’s true enemy.
一项研究表明，在20世纪独立国家的1 941名执政者中，只有27名女性，其中还有一半是以男性执政者的遗孀或女儿身份问鼎权力的。	One study of the 1,941 rulers of independent countries during the twentieth century found only 27 women, roughly half of whom came to power as widows or daughters of a male ruler.
但大多数这类政策 — — 可能银行联盟除外 — — 都旨在应对违约风险，而非铲除导致这一风险的根源。	But most of these policies – with the possible exception of the banking union – are aimed at managing default risk, not eliminating this risk’s root causes.
第二个阻力是，对西方来说，最有利的做法是袖手旁观，同时利用制裁和节节下跌的油价拖垮俄罗斯经济，最终打败普京本人。	The second objection is that the West would be best served by simply standing back and watching while sanctions and plunging oil prices bring down Russia’s economy – and ultimately Putin himself.
与此相反，各国政府却奋力延长这些不可持续的繁荣，从而进一步推高商品价格，并且增加了那种“千载难逢”的经济和金融混乱的风险。	Instead, governments are clawing to stretch out unsustainable booms, further pushing up commodity prices, and raising the risk of a once-in-a-lifetime economic and financial mess.
在意大利，民族主义的联盟党（League）与民粹主义的五星运动（Five Star Movement）组成执政联盟发号施令。	In Italy, the nationalist League party appears to be calling the shots in its new governing coalition with the populist Five Star Movement.
基于歪曲伊斯兰教义的极端主义仍在不断膨胀；事实上，只有靠宗教的方式（加上相应安全措施）才能遏制它的滋长。	Extremism based on a perversion of Islam shows no sign of abating; indeed, it will not abate until it is taken on religiously, as well as by security measures.
但制造健康还需要相关人等开展“投资合作”��—也就是让他们努力提升自己的“健康生产率 ” ， 就像企业需要激励员工提高生产率一样。	But producing health also requires “co-investment” by the people involved – that is, getting them to exert themselves to increase their “health productivity,” just as a company needs to motivate its workers to increase productivity.
匈牙利即将执掌欧盟大权，而对该国总理维克托·奥尔班篡改宪法镇压媒体的讨论却日趋激烈，同时还夹杂着人们对该国金融稳定性的再度忧虑。	Hungary’s turn at the EU helm comes at a time of fierce debate over Prime Minister Victor Orbán’s alteration of constitutional law and suppression of press freedom, as well as a new round of worries about the country’s financial sustainability.
它们是为国内不平��所困扰的正在崛起的力量，不停地向民族主义的方向发展、向处于主导地位的力量发起挑战，最终引发逆转经济全球化进展的世界战争。	A rising power, beset with internal inequality, turns to nationalism and challenges the dominant power, provoking a war that turns back the progress of economic globalization.
最近我们从新德里的一家制衣厂中营救了一批孩子，在过去三年多的时间中他们被迫待在一个不通风的地下室里每天工作20个小时。	Recently, we rescued children from a garment factory in New Delhi, where, for more than three years, they had been forced to sit and work for 20 hours a day in a basement with no ventilation.
2010年危机爆发（即希腊和其他国家的财政问题引发金融市场焦虑）前，有些经济学家纷纷猜测欧元很可能迅速取代美元而成为世界主要储备货币。	Until the crisis of 2010, when fiscal problems in Greece and elsewhere created anxiety in financial markets, some economists had speculated that the euro might soon replace the dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency.
在美国境内，过去三年就业人口从2007年的1.378亿人轻微下降到2010年7月的1.3亿人，减少了790万人 — — 要知道这段时间内人口还增长了600万。	In the United States, the past three years have seen employment fall from 137.8 million people in July 2007 to slightly less than 130 million in July 2010 – a decline of 7.9 million during a period in which the adult population grew by six million.
但有一点是显而易见的，国家（state）具有超越民族重点问题（national priority）的共同利益。	Yet one is obvious: States possess common interests that should trump national priorities.
长期方案，比如建立和连通生化检测系统等，应该予以扩大和强化，让全世界公共卫生专业人员能够追踪和报告人类和动物疫情，共同规划防御方案。	And long-term solutions such as establishing and connecting bio-surveillance systems should be expanded and strengthened, to enable public-health professionals around the world to track and report human and animal diseases and plan defenses together.
他们更有可能在动用在叙利亚的权力保护自己，或者在权力被削弱的情况下逃往莫斯科或德黑兰，阻挠对他们的抓捕行动。	They are more likely to use their power in Syria to shield themselves and, if weakened, flee to Moscow or Tehran, delaying efforts to apprehend them.
而欧盟也自顾不暇，因为它们既头痛于如何处理竞争力下降的问题，又为如何支付那些人们自以为应得的福利而苦恼。	Europeans continue to look inward, obsessed with their own problems of declining competitiveness and how to pay for entitlements that they have come to regard as theirs by right.
只有一样东西能阻止决心为ISIS而死的自杀青年：将他引向正确道路、让他相信神创造我们是为了改善而不是摧毁世界的更强大的意识形态。	Only one thing can stop a suicidal youth who is ready to die for ISIS: a stronger ideology that guides him onto the right path and convinces him that God created us to improve our world, not to destroy it.
管理层和董事会成员常常获得股权补偿，这不但使他们获得了权益，反过来又创造了一个使公司股票市场价值最大化的强大诱因。	Managers and board members often receive stock-based compensation, which gives them equity ownership rights and, in turn, creates a powerful incentive to maximize the market value of their companies’ shares.
处于同一状态的保守党政客如果了解一下已经导致了3,600多起暴力死亡的“爱尔兰问题 ” ， 将大有裨益。	Conservative politicians who find themselves in such a position would do well to know that conflicts over the “Irish question” have resulted in more than 3,600 violent deaths.
可虽然特朗普在竞选时走的是民粹主义，他的统治手段却是财阀式的，最近的例子就是他为大多数共和党人仍然坚信的那种极不可靠的供给侧税收理论背书。	But while Trump ran as a populist, he has governed as a plutocrat, most recently by endorsing the discredited supply-side theory of taxation that most Republicans still cling to.
当然，上海国际能源交易所按交易量计算仍落后于在伦敦交易的布伦特原油合约以及在纽约交易的西德克萨斯中质原油期货合同。	Of course the volume of trades on the Shanghai INE still lags behind that of the Brent oil contracts traded in London and the West Texas Intermediate oil futures traded in New York.
当越战败局已定时，美国的重点从该地区离开，让胜利者来收拾残局 — — 并最终加入东盟安全与合作格局。	When its defeat became apparent in Vietnam, the US pivoted away from the region, leaving the victor to clean up the mess – and, ultimately, to join the ASEAN structure of security and cooperation.
在捷克、匈牙利和波兰，在最后日期前完成如此艰难的改革任务，对社会主义政党来说，意味着他们不得不背叛他们在左翼选民眼里的社会主义者身份。	"In the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, the task of completing such difficult reforms just before crossing the ""finish line"" fell to socialist parties, forcing them to betray their socialist identity in the eyes of leftist voters."
但该过程导致其双轨经济在效益方面的裂变，国有企业表现明显劣于民营企业，尽管前者比后者更容易获得信贷。	But the process has created significant discrepancies in economic performance, with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) performing significantly worse than their private-sector counterparts, despite having better access to credit.
但是，除了美国可能例外，大部分发达经济体的增长仍将十分疲软，新兴市场的脆弱性 — — 包括中国在经济再平衡方面的措施不够确定 — — 可能将拖累新一年的全球增长。	But, with the possible exception of the US, growth will remain anemic in most advanced economies, and emerging-market fragility – including China’s uncertain efforts at economic rebalancing – could become a drag on global growth in subsequent years.
伦敦 – 2017年2月，我写了一则乐观的评论，题目是《令人惊喜的全球经济恢复力 》 （ The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience ） 。	LONDON – In February 2017, I wrote an optimistic commentary called “The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience.”
并且，抛去程度问题不谈，俄罗斯也绝不是唯一一个在举办奥运会、一级方程式锦标赛（今年晚些时候也将在索契进行）和世界杯足球赛期间横生贪污腐败的国家。	And, the grand scale aside, Russia is hardly the only country where Olympic sports, Formula One racing (also to take place later this year in Sochi), or World Cup soccer is a boon for larceny and graft.
但随后不久，货币紧缩让经济增长回到了减速轨道，促使政府放松政策并在2011年年底、2012年年引入了微型刺激计划。	Soon after, however, monetary tightening put economic growth back on a downward trajectory, spurring the government to loosen policy and introduce mini-stimulus packages in late 2011 and early 2012.
中国决策层就像是在下围棋，需要将国家的关键棋子 — — 即国有企业商业模式的改变 — — 在正确的时间落在正确的地方，而且棋子与棋子之间还要互相协调。	As in a game of Go, China’s leaders need to move the country’s pieces – that is to say, effect change in the SOEs’ business models – in the right place, at the right time, and in a coordinated fashion.
而如今他们却又面对着尖锐的职责，正如意大利中央银行行长马里奥·德拉齐指出的那样，许多国家央行的独立性都受到了极大挑战，特别是欧元区内的那几家。	Today, however, central banks are being sharply criticized, and their independence is coming under severe pressure in many countries, particularly in the eurozone, as Mario Draghi, the head of the Bank of Italy, recently pointed out.
将投资税收优惠扩大到德国企业也许更能刺激支出，但这样做在一个劳动力占国民收入比重已经处于下降趋势的国家存在政治问题。	Extending investment tax credits to German firms might be more effective in boosting spending, but doing so would be politically problematic in a country where labor’s share of national income is already declining.
金融包容性对实现包容性经济增长和性别平等至关重要，而且随着世界银行旨在到2020年实现全面金融覆盖，其在全球发展工作中已经发挥了显著的作用。	Financial inclusion is vital for inclusive economic growth and gender equality, and it has assumed a prominent role in global development efforts, with the World Bank aiming for universal financial inclusion by 2020.
作为回应，温家宝总理在全国人大会议期间公布了一系列措施，从在未来五年逐渐减免农业税到旨在增加农民收入的举措。	In response, Premier Wen Jiabao announced a series of measures during the NPC, ranging from phasing out agricultural taxes over the next five years to measures aimed at increasing farmers' income.
比如，近代欧洲流行一种观点，那就是如果一个女人婚前有过性行为，她就可能把爱人的印记留在自己体内，如果她婚后生子，小孩就可能会更像她从前的恋人，而不像现在的丈夫。	For example, pre-modern Europe believed that a woman who had sex before marriage might carry the imprint of her lover within her, so that her child born in wedlock would resemble the earlier lover, rather than the husband.
近年来，朝鲜在全球范围内发起了大量网络攻击，其中最著名的一次是针对索尼影业，此外还针对许多金融机构。	In recent years, North Korea has launched numerous cyber attacks around the world, most notably against Sony Pictures, but also against many financial institutions.
这就解释了为什么Skillful正在利用行业和地理数据来协助劳动者发掘本身已经具备的符合市场需要的技能、锁定他们可能想从事的职业，以及可以追求进一步职业发展或新职位的场合。	That is why Skillful is leveraging industry and geographical data to help workers discover marketable skills they already have, careers they might want, and places where they can pursue further professional development or new employment.
当时所做出的政治决策远比在巴尔干地区做出的决策风险更大，而希腊和伊比利亚的成功故事充分表明了当时所做出的勇敢决定的睿智。	Political decisions taken then were far more risky than those at hand in the Balkans, and the Greek and Iberian success stories demonstrate the wisdom of the courageous decisions taken at that time.
但有一个国家可以帮助全世界实现急需的透明度 — — 并具有四两拨千斤的影响力，那就是中国，因为朝鲜和伊朗两国的核关系必须通过中国才能实现。	One country could help the world gain the transparency – and the leverage – that it needs: China, over whose territory Iran and North Korea must be conducting their nuclear relations.
这种状况也推动食品价格上涨，迄今为止至少令3000万贫困人口陷入饥饿，到2020年预计还有4千到1亿3千万人会加入饥饿大军。	It also drives up food prices, which so far has pushed at least 30 million poor people into starvation, with another 40-130 million expected to be starving by 2020.
但是，在制定具体政策的时候必须慎之又慎，历史上，意在降低商品价格波动性的措施最后反而助长波动的例子数不胜数。	But adverse movements in the terms of trade must be accommodated; they cannot be fought with monetary policy.
此外还有库尔德人尚未得偿所愿的建国野心（他们中有大量生活在土耳其、斯拉克、叙利亚和伊朗）以及如何调和以色列的现实和巴勒斯坦人的政治目标这一悬而未决的问题。	There are also the unfulfilled national aspirations of the Kurds (large numbers of whom live in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran) and the unresolved matter of how to reconcile the reality of Israel with the Palestinians’ political goals.
在某些地区 — — 包括埃及南部、黎巴嫩山区和安纳托利亚（Anatolia）东南部 — — 基督徒更是占据绝对多数。	In certain areas – including southern Egypt, the mountains of Lebanon, and southeastern Anatolia – they formed an absolute majority.
“软实力 ” — —通过吸引和劝说而非强制和收买来影响他人的能力 — — 有时被用来形容任何不涉及武力的权力行使 — — 但这是错误的。	The term “soft power” – the ability to affect others by attraction and persuasion rather than the hard power of coercion and payment – is sometimes used to describe any exercise of power that does not involve the use of force.
最近，全球保护主义的兴起让这一困境变得更加糟糕，一个明证是富士康公司（苹果公司的主要供应商）决定在华盛顿投资100亿美元建设新工厂。	Recently, the rise in global protectionism has made this difficult situation worse, as epitomized by the decision of Foxconn (a major supplier to Apple) to invest $10 billion in a new factory in Wisconsin.
他必须从现在 — — 即第一次出访北约、出席G7峰会开始。 在出访的前几站，即沙特阿拉伯和以色列，他已经表现出略微朝这个方向转变的迹象。	Trump’s presence at the NATO and G7 summits, in particular, has created more uncertainty, underscored by German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s statement that, “The times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over.”
因此，去年12月，我寻求引入修正刑法典第377条并让一切成年人之间的性行为（不论性别和取向）脱罪的法案。	So, last December, I sought to introduce a bill that would have amended Section 377 and decriminalized all consensual sex between adults, irrespective of their gender and sexuality.
当时，所有人都认为已经给了和平足够的机会。 （没有给和平足够的机会，这正是为什么号召在外交努力已被认为无法取得任何成果时时马上结束通常是错误的。	No one at the time tried to argue that peace was not given a chance, which is why advocating a quick end to diplomacy when it is judged unlikely to achieve anything is often a mistake.
然而在此之后美国经济鸿沟却日益拉宽，对那些没有受过大学教育的人产生了毁灭性的影响，而该群体里包含了近3/4的非裔美国人。	And yet the economic divide in the US has grown much wider, with devastating effects on those without a college education, a group that includes almost three-quarters of African-Americans.
此外，通过任命性别平衡的内阁，领导者正在有意识地面对女性在政治领域的某种共同经历：那就是，女性在数量上远低于她们的男性同僚。	Moreover, by appointing gender-balanced cabinets, leaders are intentionally addressing a common experience for women in politics: being vastly outnumbered by male counterparts.
坎布里奇—约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz ） 、 罗杰·法尔莫（Roger Farmer）和我现在是、并且早就已经在什么才是最重要的要点方面达成了一致。	CAMBRIDGE – Joseph Stiglitz, Roger Farmer, and I are now and have long been in agreement on what are probably the most important points.
印度空间研究组织（ISRO）的科学家们自信从这一教训中汲取了宝贵的经验，但Chandrayaan任务的局部失败仍使他们挥之不去的阴影。	While scientists at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) believe that they gained valuable lessons from the experience, the partial failure of the Chandrayaan mission still haunts them.
但他们的观点被西尼尔（Nassau Senior）反对，他认为就连食品救济都不应该有：尽管数百万人因爱尔兰土豆饥荒丧命，但“这远远不够 。 ”	But they were balanced by those like Nassau Senior, who spoke out against even famine relief: Although a million people would die in the Irish Potato Famine, “that would scarcely be enough.”
这不仅缩短了它们的通讯时间；也改善了能源效率，幅度可达5,000倍 — — 有望产生能源效率接近生物脑的计算机。	This not only reduces the time they take to communicate; it improves energy efficiency by a factor of as much as 5,000 – potentially providing computers with efficiency close to that of a biological brain.
为了将生物医学工程应用于难民健康挑战，学生，专家和从业者需要去熟悉难民定居点的条件，并加深对困难难民所受复杂创伤的理解。	To apply biomedical engineering to refugee health challenges, students, experts, and practitioners need to familiarize themselves with conditions in refugee settlements, and deepen their understanding of the complex traumas that afflict refugees.
沙特阿拉伯支持与巴林街头示威者的和平谈判，也向巴林提供了大量经济援助用于改善生活，但我们永远不会接受伊朗对巴林的吞并。	Saudi Arabia has supported peaceful negotiations with street protesters in Bahrain, and has provided the country with considerable economic aid to improve life there, but we will never accept an Iranian takeover.
在更宏观方面，特朗普声称世界贸易组织（WTO）已经失能 — — 例如对中国而言 — — 而美国应该退出该组织。	More broadly, Trump argues that the World Trade Organization has failed – for example, with regard to China – and that the United States should withdraw from the organization.
而在大选中遭到对手暗算的两位总统候选人 — — 也都是当年的老革命 — — 则本能地把眼前的局面视为一次历史的重演。	The cheated presidential candidates, both veterans of the revolution, instinctively thought of a replay of history.
战斗加剧了地区不稳定局势；美国和欧洲公民正涌入叙利亚参加圣战；而且一战后中东边界正在解体的看法也越来越被人们所接受。	The fighting has heightened instability in the region; US and European citizens are streaming into Syria to take up jihad; and there is a growing consensus that the post-World War I Middle East boundaries are coming undone.
失业大军中不仅包括建筑工人，还包括水暖工和电工等房地产附属工种，以及房地产中介和银行职员等辅助性行业。	The unemployed comprise not only construction workers, but also ancillary workers, such as real-estate brokers and bankers, as well as all those who work on houses, such as plumbers and electricians.
只有欧洲央行承担起最终贷款人的角色，才能制止欧元区资本外流，并恢复人们对欧洲解决自身问题能力的信心。	Only the ECB, by taking on the role of lender of last resort, can stop the eurozone’s capital outflow and restore confidence in Europe’s capacity to solve its own problems.
对此法国历史学家和社会学家伊曼努尔·托德（Emmanuel Todd）认为，无论在世界哪个地方，经济腾飞通常都会在一国50%以上民众脱离文盲后的60~70年后实现。	The French historian and sociologist Emmanuel Todd has argued that, everywhere in the world, economic takeoff usually occurs 60-70 years after 50% of the population achieves literacy.
纽约—伊斯坦布尔、达卡和巴格达的致命恐怖袭击表明伊斯兰国（ISIS）的魔爪已经触及欧洲、北非、中东和亚洲多部。	NEW YORK – Deadly terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Dhaka, and Baghdad demonstrate the murderous reach of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.
我们怎能肯定它们不会“泄露”并感染更大范围的系统，或者被转作其他用途，再或者未来的无赖国家或恐怖分子不会利用它们反过来攻击它们的创造者？	How can we be sure that they won’t “escape” and infect a much broader class of systems, or be adopted for other uses, or that future rogue states or terrorists won’t find a way to turn them on their creators?
如果政府果真更为积极，那么为什么我们没有见到对其他争议，例如盗取农田、投资者权利受损或者高层腐败等的类似的反应呢？	If the government were truly becoming more responsive, why have we not seen similar responses to other disputes over the theft of farmland, compromised investors’ rights, or high-level corruption?
研究显示，非矿物燃料能源资源 — — 依据目前的可应用性 — — 在帮助我们在2050年保持一个稳定的碳排放量方面也只能解决不到一半的需要，而在达成2100年目标方面也只能是杯水车薪。	Research shows that non-fossil fuel energy sources will – based on today’s availability – get us less than halfway toward a path of stable carbon emissions by 2050, and only a tiny fraction of the way towards stabilization by 2100.
这意味着不仅要承认卡扎菲政策及当前问题间有着重要的联系，而且还要确保不会在抹去卡扎菲记忆的仓促浪潮中牺牲本应被保留的东西。	That means not only recognizing the vital link between his policies and today’s problems, but also ensuring that what should be preserved is not sacrificed in the rush to efface his memory.
问题不在于政府和央行无法重塑就业，或不知道如何重塑就业；而在于政府和央行不会采取规模足够大的扩张性政策步骤来迅速重塑充分就业。	The issue is not that governments and central banks cannot restore employment, or do not know how; it is that governments and central banks will not take expansionary policy steps on a large enough scale to restore full employment rapidly.
欧盟各成员国在一些敏感的政治议题，例如税收，健康教育，养老金，就业市场以及外交政策等方面，都有自己的决定权。	The EU’s member states retain power over the most sensitive political issues, including taxes, health, education, pensions, the labor market, and foreign policy.
首先也是最重要的，奥巴马必须在国会的支持下要求披露所有与美国国家安全机构和美国IT企业间互动有关的信息。	First and foremost, Obama, with support from Congress, must demand the release of all information regarding interactions between national security agencies and American IT firms.
但这一委员会能给默克尔带来额外的政治收益 — — 它可以限制她的副总理兼财政部长、社会民主党的欧拉夫·舒尔茨（Olaf Scholz）的影响力。	Yes, such a committee would bring Merkel the added political benefit of constraining the influence of Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, her Vice-Chancellor and finance minister.
而那些粗鲁些的英国退欧主义者则明确表示他们要让不加管制就会遍布英国各地的强奸犯、罪犯和拼命生小孩的外国人（尤其是土耳其人）进不了英国。	And the cruder Brexiteers were explicit that they would deny entry to the rapists, criminals, and fast-breeding foreigners (Turks in particular) who would otherwise flood the land.
一些国家重启了资本账户流入管制，如对购买本国债券、股票和衍生品的外国投资者征税、对短期资本流实施储备金要求等。	Some resorted to capital-account regulations on inflows, such as taxes on the foreign purchases of bonds, equities, and derivatives, reserve requirements on short-term inflows, and so forth.
假设确是如此 — — 许多这些地区的决策者都倾向如此 — — 耶伦对美国银行系统“大大增强”的担保也将适用于发达世界的其他所有具系统重要性的银行管理辖区。	Assuming that it does, as policymakers there intend, Yellen’s assurance of a “much stronger” banking system in the US will apply to all of the other systemically important banking jurisdictions in the developed world, too.
因为真正的大新闻是上月英国、德国，法国和意大利与其他30多个国家一同成为亚洲基础设施投资银行（亚投行）的创始国。	Indeed, that news was made last month, when the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy joined more than 30 other countries as founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
基于实用主义政治考虑（比如利比亚-意大利关系）或裙带主义的大资金分配应该被重新评估，并要以更好更强的治理实践作为标准。	Large allocations based on pragmatic political concerns, such as Libya-Italy relations, or cronyism should be reevaluated in the light of better and stronger governance practices.
AGOA包含一个日落条款，但是，如果正如在香港世贸会议规定的那样将针对非洲欠发达国家而言免税准入永久化，那么亚洲穷国将继续失去美国的市场份额。	AGOA had a sunset clause, but if the duty-free access becomes permanent for less developed countries in Africa – as stipulated in Hong Kong – then poor countries in Asia will continue to lose US market share.
认为更少的人活得更长更好的一个原因是，只有被生出来的人才知道剥夺生命意味着什么；本不存在的人不会知道他们失去了什么。	One reason for thinking it better to have fewer people living longer lives is that only those who are born know what death deprives them of; those who do not exist cannot know what they are missing.
在过去一周里，安倍为自己创造很大的以战略合作伙伴身份施展的政治空间 — — 不仅是对印度，也包括日本的其他盟国，特别是美国。	In the past week, Abe created for himself considerably more political space to act as a strategic partner, not only to India, but also to Japan’s other allies, particularly the United States.
比如说，伏马菌素（fumonisin）以及其他真菌都拥有极强毒性，不但会使人类罹患食道癌，还能令其他食用玉米的牲畜患上致命性疾病。	For example, fumonisin and some other fungal toxins are highly toxic, causing esophageal cancer in humans and fatal diseases in livestock that eat infected corn.
如果说失业率并没有维持在“大萧条”时期的水平，但也高得足以使长期失业或对长期失业的恐惧成为一种刻骨铭心的经历。	If unemployment was not stuck quite at Great Depression levels, it remained high enough to make long-term joblessness or the fear of long-term joblessness a defining experience.
最近的事件进一步削弱了俄罗斯国内亲西方的市场派，强化了国家资本主义和民族主义派，后两者正在试图加快欧亚联盟的建立。	Recent events have further weakened market-oriented, Western-leaning factions in Russia and strengthened the state-capitalist, nationalist factions, who are now pushing for faster establishment of the EAU.
此外，人均欧盟生产率 — — 在1995年之前的20年中，欧洲的这一指标一直在向美国靠拢，到1995年时只比美国低5 % — —在欧元区危机前的十年中相对美国下降了10个百分点。	Furthermore, per capita EU productivity, which had been converging on the US level for 20 years up to 1995, when Europe was only about 5% below the US, lost ten percentage points in relative terms in the decade preceding the eurozone crisis.
在19世纪晚期诸如“牛肉、肱二头肌和薄伽梵歌”等口号的激励下，国民志愿团模仿欧洲法西斯向身着卡其色的军服的印度教年轻人灌输他们自己的军事纪律理想。	Inspired by late-nineteenth-century slogans such as “Beef, Biceps, and the Bhagavad Gita,” the RSS emulated European fascists by instilling their own ideals of military discipline in young Hindus in khaki uniforms.
事实上，我们的一次性经济的后果 — — 如二氧化碳排放量的高企、难以管理的废品潮和越来越难以提取资源等 — — 已经显露无疑。	Indeed, the consequences of our disposable economy – skyrocketing CO2 emissions, unmanageable waste streams, and the increasing difficulty of extracting resources, to name a few – are already apparent.
受国外金主的慷慨支持，近几年来沙拉菲派原教旨主义 — — 一个偏隘的伊斯兰教流派，与几百年来在印度大量存在的更温和的苏菲派变体大相径庭 — — 正在孟加拉国蔓延。	Backed by lavish financing from abroad, Salafist fundamentalism – an intolerant version of Islam at odds with the more moderate Sufi-influenced variant that prevailed in India for centuries – has been spreading across Bangladesh in recent years.
比如，当牧师离开“圣职”时，他们便“退回世俗状态 ” — —有居高临下之嫌的专用词，天主教的顽固不化可见一斑。	For example, when priests leave “holy orders,” they are “reduced to the lay state” – a bit of condescending terminology that says a lot about the Church’s archaic mindset.
因此蓬佩奥有理由担心他在秘密会谈中的所见所闻会遭泄露，并反过来破坏峰会并夺走政府即将到手的政治胜利。	Thus, it was reasonable for Pompeo to fear that knowledge of his secret talks would be leaked in an effort to undermine the summit and deny the administration a potential political victory.
分歧不可避免，但让欧洲保持静止，抑或有时以不同的步伐让开放的欧洲不断前进，究竟哪一个才是更好的选择？	There will be disagreement, but is it better to have a static Europe or a Europe that advances, sometimes at different paces, and that is open to all?
华盛顿 — — 印度正面临多年来最严重的水资源危机，约有3亿3000万人（占全国人口的1/4）面临严重干旱的影响。	WASHINGTON, DC – India is currently facing its worst water crisis in years, with an estimated 330 million people – one-quarter of its population – affected by severe drought.
6月以来上证指数两位数的下跌之所以没有引起经济危机，主要是因为只有不到10%的中国家庭参与了股市，而股票只占家庭资产的不到15 % 。	The double-digit drop in the Shanghai Composite Index since June has not triggered an economic crisis largely because fewer than 10% of Chinese households participate in the stock market, and equities comprise less than 15% of household assets.
有时我们被邀请提早出席，希望我们能在官方代表到来之前就提早离开，这种方法有时管用，有时也会发生意外。	Or we were invited to come at an earlier hour in the hope that we would leave before the official representatives arrived, which sometimes worked and sometimes didn’t.
这是重要的，因为欧洲对俄国的一贯政策是欧洲面临的关键而又急迫的挑战之一，这一政策取决于波兰和德国之间的紧密合作。	This is important because a consistent European policy toward Russia – one of the key urgent challenges facing Europe – depends on close cooperation between Poland and Germany.
而这也是为什么我们呼吁实施一些额外手段去加强伊朗政治变革的前景，催生一个准备与人民和邻国和平共处的伊朗政府。	This is why additional measures are called for to improve the prospects for political change that brings about an Iranian government prepared to live in peace with its own people and its neighbors.
专家试图让美国人了解埃博拉传播有多么困难，以及埃博拉为何不可能在美国形成流行之势，但人们往往充耳不闻。	Experts’ attempts to impress upon Americans how difficult Ebola is to transmit, and how unlikely an Ebola epidemic in the US was, fell largely on deaf ears.
巴西最近登上了国际新闻的头版头条，但却不是因为城市暴力、自然灾害、政治腐败或亚马逊地区森林砍伐等传统的报导。	RIO DE JANEIRO – Brazil has been making international headlines of late, but not for traditional stories about urban violence, natural catastrophes, political corruption, or deforestation in the Amazon.
是的，民主党总统候选人伯尔尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sandees）说丹麦是理想的居住地，它做对了很多事。	Yes, Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was right that Denmark is a great place to live and does many things right.
俄罗斯与包括土耳其这个北约成员国在内的所有主要地区大国的一唱一和，证明了克里姆林宫外交政策的活力（以及利益导向 ） 。	Russia’s coordination with all major regional powers – including Turkey, a NATO member – attests to the dynamism (and cynicism) of the Kremlin’s foreign policy.
发自拉古纳海滩 — — 在高涨的期望和球迷汹涌澎湃的热情支持下，埃及国家男子足球队在时隔28年后再次入围世界杯决赛圈。	LAGUNA BEACH – Egypt’s national soccer team rode to Russia for their first World Cup finals in 28 years on a wave of lofty expectations and potent fan enthusiasm.
投资者认为这些风险或许不会升级，或者发达经济体的宽松货币政策和持续复苏能够遏制这些风险，这也许是对的。	Investors may be right that these risks will not materialize in their more severe form, or that loose monetary policies in advanced economies and continued recovery will contain such risks.
一部分 ， “ 记忆的丰富遗产”是植根于过去。 而另一部分，与现在相关并通往未来，是以公民共同建造公共生活的普遍意愿为构成要素的。	One part, the “rich inheritance of memories,” is rooted in the past, while the other, related to the present and opening the way to the future, consists in the common will of citizens to build their public life together.
叶利钦和他们有着共同的目标，但是有一点与他们不同：他认识到了帝制与民主的不相容性，所以愿意放弃苏联而努力在其国内建立民主制度。	Yeltsin aimed for the same goal. But he stands out from them in this respect: he understood that empire was incompatible with democracy, and so was willing to abandon the Soviet Union in order to try to build a democratic order at home.
在现有基础上，数学模型预测植物总共约有350,000种，比目前所知的多出15%左右。 这一数字与专家意见其实不谋而合。	Based on this development, mathematical models predict that roughly 15% more plant species exist than are currently known, for a total of some 350,000 species – a figure that is consistent with expert opinion.
他父亲的梦想被终结了，而他所有的只剩下无主题的实用主义，并成为他执政的鲜明印记，这一点他日后才逐渐认识到。	The dreams from his father were at an end, and he was left, as he only slowly realized, with the themeless pragmatism that has become the hallmark of his administration.
北约对科索沃的干预就是一例，这次事件中，几个政府选择对另一个政府（塞尔维亚）的主权进行干预，目的是阻止种族清洗和屠杀。	The NATO intervention in Kosovo was an example where a number of governments chose to violate the sovereignty of another government (Serbia) to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide.
根据经济学家巴里·艾肯格林（Barry Eichengreen ） 、 朴东炫（Donghyun Park）和康镐炫（Kwanho Shin）的研究，这一比例大约是美国人均收入的60 % （ 以2005年国际价格计算 ） 。	According to the economists Barry Eichengreen, Donghyun Park, and Kwanho Shin, that share is about 60% of America’s per capita income (at 2005 international prices).
当你购买通用汽车的产品时，你所付的每一美元中就有80美分揣进了通用汽车的腰包，而通用汽车公司所做的仅仅是自我管理。	When you buy a car from General Motors, 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM, which mostly only manages itself.
我们希望，在安全共享数据的同时保护隐私的能力能够鼓励个人、公司和政府广泛交流各自的想法，从而提高整个城市的生产率和创造力。	We hope that the ability to share data safely, while protecting privacy, will encourage individuals, companies, and governments to communicate their ideas widely, and so increase productivity and creativity across the entire city.
相反，传统发展经济学家会说，芬兰不应该出口木材；而应该将木材转化为纸和家具，以此获得附加值。 芬兰也这么做了。	By contrast, a traditional development economist would argue that it should not export wood; instead, it should add value by transforming the wood into paper or furniture – something that Finland also does.
10月，劳工部步其后尘，用“澄清”缓解了退休基金关于投资于产生社会和经济两方面回报的初创企业的顾虑。	In October, the Department of Labor followed up with a “clarification’’ that eased worries at pension funds about investing in ventures that produce social as well as economic returns.
在危机四伏的环境下，我们不可低估这一举动对阿根廷以及其他国家的重要性。 其他国家领导人正在密切观察如何应对自身经济困难的线索。	At a time of daunting crisis conditions, one should not underestimate the importance of this move not just for Argentina, but also for other countries, where leaders are watching closely for clues about how to deal with their own economic woes.
而罗姆尼则会重拾奥巴马早年许下的那些尚未兑现的承诺，虽然奥巴马会将罗姆尼称为一个见风使舵的“骑墙派 ” 。	Romney, for his part, will hold up Obama’s early, still-unmet promises, while Obama will call Romney a “flip-flopper” who changes his positions to suit the moment (and the audience).
希腊公民必然认为，如果他们在因为退出欧元区而导致的困难时期继续信任他们的政府，就可以摆脱严重的不公。	Greece’s citizens must believe that they are escaping grave injustice if they are to continue to trust their government during the difficult period that would follow an exit from the eurozone.
而对于开发利用核能资源的新方法，以及解决核废料问题来说，这么一个对强相互作用力的精确理解都将非常意义重大。	A preciseunderstanding of the strong force could be just as important, opening new ways to use nuclear-energy resources while solving the problems of safety and nuclear waste.
有些人会觉得在这个年龄生育孩子有点荒唐，因为大多数妇女在这个年纪已经做了祖母了；但更重要的问题是，如果他们的父母死亡或变得无力抚养他们，这些孩子将得到什么样的照顾呢？	Some will find it grotesque to become a mother at an age when most women are grandmothers, but the more significant question is what kind of care such children will have if their parents die or become incapable of rearing them.
同样，无论对于儿童还是成人，公共图书馆都能带来真正的价值 — — 让所有人拥有世俗和自由的集会空间，在赋予每个人学习机会的同时为他们提供数字化服务。	Likewise, for children and adults alike, there is real value in, say, public libraries – secular and free gathering spaces that offer universal access to learning and, increasingly, provide a gateway to digital services.
这一思想认为，长期而言，参与自由贸易的国家将发现新的增长渠道，失去了某个产业的工作的工人将在另一个产业找到新工作。	Countries that engage in free trade will find new channels for growth in the long run, the thinking goes, and workers who lose their jobs in one industry will find employment in another.
日益增加的球员跨国流动使得各国球技水平走向趋同，这一点从阿根廷、巴西、法国、德国，意大利和西班牙等传统足球强国的统治地位下降上可以看出。	The increased movement of players across borders has already contributed to a convergence among countries’ skill levels, reflected in the declining dominance of traditional powerhouses like Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.
和大部分革命一样，这场革命之所以没有发生，就像赫胥黎（Thomas Huxley）所预言的那样，是因为美妙的旧理论被丑陋的新事实所扼杀。	As with most revolutions, this one is not happening because, as Thomas Huxley surmised, a beautiful old theory has been killed by ugly new facts.
他甚至还更进一步挑明这一指向，批评各国可能抛弃巴黎气候协议的举措 — — 正如特朗普威胁要做的那样。	He was even more pointed in criticizing the prospect of abandoning the Paris climate agreement – as Trump has threatened to do.
这篇评论令那些只看到西方国家 — — 包括特朗普刚刚发表了就职演说的美国 — — 阴暗面的人感到震惊。	The piece came as a surprise to those who saw only bleak prospects for Western countries, not least the United States, where US President Donald Trump had just been inaugurated.
误导性宏观经济政策所赐让该比例继续下降至9 % ， 特别是里根时期，赤字支出和过于紧缩的货币政策导致美元飙升，破坏了竞争力。	That share fell further, to 9% because of misguided macroeconomic policies, especially during the Reagan era, when deficit spending and overly tight monetary policy caused the dollar to soar, undermining competitiveness.
这有一个前提：穆斯林兄弟会实现内部重组并找到办法与走极端路线的派系保持距离，并对脆弱群体和社会少数派推行包容性政策。	This presupposes that the Brothers reorganize themselves internally and find ways to distance themselves from more radical factions, and that they promote inclusive policies toward vulnerable groups and social minorities.
在负责同级的外交部时，他的主要成就是与法国结成紧密联盟并进行大量安全合作 — — 包括在核技术方面的合作。	Running a sort of parallel foreign ministry, his main achievement was the creation of a close alliance and strong security cooperation – including with respect to nuclear technology – with France.
第二个问题是人们为什么会接受极端思想？ 研究和安全人员对此进行了探索，并一致认为感觉受到排斥的人接受极端思想的可能性更大。	The second question – why are some people attracted to radical ideas? – has been explored by researchers and security practitioners, who generally agree that people are more inclined to accept radical ideologies if they feel alienated.
诚然，早在20世纪60年代初，肯尼迪政府成员就开始了战争的理智化，争论战略（包括反动乱战略）的合理性。	To be sure, in the early 1960’s, members of President John F. Kennedy’s administration intellectualized war and debated the merits of strategies, including counterinsurgency.
更重要的是，美国公司并非如同特朗普和国会共和党所声称的那样，是因为税率太高而囤积了数万亿美元现金而拒绝进行资本投资。	More to the point, US corporations aren’t hoarding trillions of dollars in cash and refusing to make capital investments because the tax rate is too high, as Trump and congressional Republicans claim.
列宁的分析也许是错误的，但如今，我们知道，他的结论是正确的，只是正确的原因是另外一个：金融资本主义迫使一国走向不可持续的负债。	Lenin may have gotten the underlying analysis wrong, but today we know that his conclusion may have been right for another reason: financial capitalism forces a country into unsustainable indebtedness.
Des objectifs si ambitieux, aussi irréalistes soient-ils, peuvent provoquer une dynamique de discipline, et pousser certains pays de l’UE à augmenter leurs dépenses, alors même que l’UE a lancé un certain nombre de programmes prometteurs.	Such ambitious goals, however unrealistic, can have a disciplining effect, leading some EU countries to increase their spending, while the EU itself has launched a number of promising schemes.
墨西哥可以利用一系列移民工具，如放松对危地马拉南部边境的控制，或者在美国当局无法证明其墨西哥国籍的情况下拒绝从美国接纳被驱逐者。	Mexico can use a number of tools on immigration, such as loosening controls on its southern border with Guatemala or refusing admission to deportees from the US unless American authorities can corroborate their Mexican nationality.
铁路系统容量有限，公路也只有14%能够畅通。 这并不令人惊奇，因为2000—2011年间巴西的基础设施投资平均只占GDP的2.2 % ， 远低于全球平均水平。	The rail system is limited, and only 14% of roads are paved, which is not surprising, given that Brazil’s investment in infrastructure averaged only 2.2% of GDP in 2000-2011 – well below the global average.
当我在1980年代初加入国际货币基金组织时，与非政府对口机构进行磋商 — — 无论是针对国家还是政策工作 — — 都是不受鼓励的。	When I joined the IMF in the early 1980s, discussions with non-government counterparts, whether on country or policy work, were discouraged. The situation today is very different.
相反，如果一国人均收入比另一国高100 % ， 那么它所接收的商务旅行者将多出130 % ， 它发出的商务旅行者将多出170 % 。	By contrast, a country with a per capita income that is 100% higher than another receives 130% more business travelers and sends 170% more people abroad.
比如，多数由政府主办的难民庇护所并未提供区分性别的浴室和厕所 — — 这对来自保守伊斯兰环境的女性不啻具有灾难性。	For example, most government refugee shelters didn’t provide gender-exclusive toilets and showers – a disaster for women from conservative Islamic backgrounds.
即将履新的特朗普政府必须充分明白，追求可持续性日程的经济和环境利益总和仍将推动各国和各公司朝这个方向努力。	It must be abundantly clear to the incoming administration that the combined economic and environmental interest in pursuing the sustainability agenda will continue to push countries and companies alike in that direction.
在我们了解到推动这些意外变化的因素之前，我们需要注意这些调查结果的呈现方式，以及它们如何为政策制定提供信息。	Until we understand what’s driving these unexpected changes, we need to be mindful of how survey findings are presented, and how they inform policymaking decisions.
两国都有着目空一切的民族主义，都相信自己的力量无法抗拒，而美国因陷入伊拉克和阿富汗战争的泥沼而江河日下更使他们觉得无所畏惧。	Both are marked by a defiant nationalism, and both feel irresistible, all the more so because they sense that the United States is in decline as a result of the quagmire in Iraq, if not in Afghanistan as well.
为了心灵导师所提供的安全，而心甘情愿将妻子和女儿奉献给他的人们，无法明白为何同样的赐予两位女性的“保佑”会让他锒铛入狱。	People who were willing to lend their wives and daughters to their guru, for the sake of the security he offered, could not understand why the same “blessing,” extended to the two girls, should land him in jail.
而现在他拥有了卡钦斯基的支持，并因此深受马切雷维奇和（刚刚实现了对法院直接控制的）司法部长兹比格涅夫·兹波布罗等其他法律与正义党领导人物的妒忌。	And now that he has Kaczyński’s support, he is deeply resented by other leading PiS figures such as Macierewicz and justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who has just assumed direct control of the courts.
“身处全球金融系统核心 ， ” 他说 ， “ 扩大了追寻英国储蓄的机构的投资机会，也增强了英国制造业和创新行业的全球竞争力 。 ”	“Being at the heart of the global financial system,” he said, “broadens the investment opportunities for the institutions that look after British savings, and reinforces the ability of UK manufacturing and creative industries to compete globally.”
保持内部凝聚力的一种方法是创造“恶魔 ” — —这是从二十世纪九十年代阿尔及利亚和二十世纪七八十年代阿根廷的“肮脏战争”中学来的。	And one way to maintain internal cohesion is to create “demons” – a lesson learned from the “dirty wars” in Algeria in the 1990’s and Argentina in the 1970’s and 1980’s.
正如发明这一词汇的约翰•威廉姆森（John Williamson）在2002年所指出的那样，这些措施“是十全十美，万无一失的，因此我们才有必要就此达成共识 。 ”	As John Williamson, who coined the term, put it in 2002, these measures “are motherhood and apple pie, which is why they commanded a consensus.”
欧盟这样做的一个原因是不愿和俄罗斯发生争端。 俄罗斯仍将我们视为其紧密的盟友、自然的贸易伙伴和其领导下的不断扩大的经济区的成员。	One reason for this is that the EU does not want to pick a fight with Russia, which still sees us as its close ally, natural business partner, and as members of an enlarging Russian-led economic zone.
如果这些富裕国家继续只给予那些最贫穷国家一点点的、不足以解决问题的帮助，那么这些最贫穷国家将永远不会摆脱贫困。	If donors keep giving only a little bit of help, but not enough to solve the problems of the poorest countries, these countries will never escape poverty's grip.
举个例子，最初令阿迪提亚纳受到关注的是其煽动性的反穆斯林言论 — — 为此他因煽动宗教紧张的罪名 — — 并领导一队专门袭击穆斯林目标的志愿者 — — 于2007年在监狱里蹲了11天。	Adityanath, for example, first gained attention for his incendiary anti-Muslim speeches – he spent 11 days in jail in 2007 for fomenting religious tension – and for leading a squad of volunteers who specialized in attacking Muslim targets.
考虑到中国净对外贷款头寸高达1.8万亿美元或GDP的17.2 % ， 央行有足够的流动性，不必推出非常规货币政策（极低利率 ） ， 而只需降低银行的准备金率来应对可能的债务危机。	Given that China’s net external lending position amounts to $1.8 trillion, or 17.2% of GDP, the central bank has enough liquidity to reduce banks’ reserve requirements without resorting to unconventional monetary policy.
在爱尔兰逮捕了多位试图谋杀一名将先知默罕默德描绘成一条狗的瑞典卡通画家的所谓圣战者之后，这个问题变得更加紧迫了。	This issue has been given new urgency by the arrests in Ireland of alleged jihadists from several countries who are accused of plotting to murder a Swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet Mohammed as a dog.
所有美国的袭击都发生在偏远的北部，巴基斯坦部落的瓦齐里斯坦地区，尽管阿富汗塔利班及其哈卡尼组织和希克马蒂亚尔组织等盟友没有隐藏在那里。	All of the US strikes have occurred farther north, in Pakistan’s tribal Waziristan region, although the leadership of the Afghan Taliban and of its allied groups, like the Haqqani network and the Hekmatyar band, is not holed up there.
因此，政策着力点必须也放在耶鲁大学政治学家雅各布·哈克（Jacob Hacker）所谓的“前分配 ” （ pre-distribution）上，即改变市场决定的工资收入结构。	The policy focus, therefore, must also be on what Yale University political scientist Jacob Hacker calls “pre-distribution”: changing the market-determined structure of wage incomes.
在六月发布的一份报告中，六家银行汇报了自联合报告开始四年来他们如何提供了超过1000亿美元的气候融资。	In a report released in June, the six banks described how they have provided more than $100 billion in climate finance in the four years since joint reporting began.
这些问题属于错误的二分法，我们可以通过制定扬“和”抑“或”的政策来避免它们，让各种利益都能得到平等的照顾。	Those are all false dichotomies, which we can avoid by developing policies that favor “and” over “or,” allowing all sets of interests to be pursued in parallel.
但更令人忧心的是，曾经有段时期连挪威诺贝尔奖评选委员会都似乎要向北京低头，但委员们最终决定坚持原决议 — — 这才是唯一的正道，因为一个褒扬道德勇气的奖项是不能被其颁发者所妥协和出卖的。	But in the end it decided to go ahead with the award. That is only fitting: an award for moral courage ought not to be compromised by those offering it.
“这个国家的人受够了专家 ， ” 戈夫不耐烦地说，他指的是“来自名字由缩写组成的组织的专家，他们总是说自己知道怎么做最好，但每次都弄错 。 ”	“People in this country have had enough of experts,” Gove testily explained, referring to “experts from organizations with acronyms, saying they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong.”
全球治理往往只是保护既得利益全球计划的代名词，也正因如此，它所起到的主要作用是在推进全球化的同时协调国内经济政策。	Too often, global governance is another name for the pursuit of these interests’ global agenda, which is why it ends up mainly furthering globalization and harmonizing domestic economic policies.
如果没有来自国际社会 — — 特别是和平协定担保国迅速而大胆的确保诺言兑现的行动，我们将会失去这次宝贵的机会。	Without swift and bold action from the international community – particularly from those who guarantee the peace agreement – to ensure that promises are kept, this opportunity will be lost.
但该网站还公开了年轻的穆兄会活跃分子对戈兹兰的立场的批评 — — 对于极少公开内部异见的组织来说，这是一个引人注目的情况。	But it also published harsh criticism of Ghozlan’s position by young Brotherhood activists – a notable development for an organization in which dissent is rarely publicized.
正如一位阿富汗政府官员说的那样 ， “ 如果你不能清除一个腐败的法官，你怎么能够对付塔利班呢 ？ ”	As one senior Afghan government official said, “If you can’t remove a corrupt judge, how can you deal with the Taliban?”
格里洛与北方联盟的马蒂奥·萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）十分相似，他没有什么政治经验，不了解欧洲的历史，没有多少经过提炼的观点，也没有可信的未来愿景。	Grillo – much like Lega Nord’s Matteo Salvini – has scant political experience, little knowledge of European history, few refined arguments, and no credible vision for the future.
《金融时报》最近对美联储副主席斯坦利·费舍尔（Stanley Fischer）的采访相当引人注目，因为它揭露了一些重大分歧。	A remarkable recent interview in the Financial Times with Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer laid bare some major disagreements.
此外征召人们牺牲性命换来的高额战争利润激起了民众的普遍愤怒，导致许多人（且不仅仅是美国人）开始鼓吹“财富征用 ” 。	Moreover, widespread anger over high war profits while men were being conscripted to risk their lives led many people, not just Americans, to start advocating for “wealth conscription.”
此外，两类与能源相关的安全问题也越来越引起人们的担忧：即由能源应用特点所引发的暴力危险与日俱增，以及能源使用的成本居高不下。	Moreover, there is deepening concern about two types of energy-related security problems: the increasing risk of violence stemming from the nature of our energy use, and the high cost of that energy.
类似政府最近收紧信贷这样的狭隘政策将使其难以将金融资源导入实体经济 — — 而这正是李克强经济学的一个重要目标。	Narrow policies like the government’s recent credit tightening will make it difficult to direct financial resources to the real economy – one of the primary objectives of “Likonomics.”
使用这一规则看起来相当合理，如果我们将自己置于被绑架者的处境，或想象我们的孩子、父母或配偶被恐怖分子绑架并且获得交钱放人的可信条件的话。	Applying it can seem justifiable if we put ourselves in the position of a captive, or imagine that our child, parent, or spouse has been captured by terrorists who make a credible offer to release our loved one for a ransom.
高额关税可以破坏市场并限制贸易，恰恰因为企业希望减少他们所缴纳的关税 — — 并因此在全球范围内以相应的方式来分配产能。	Higher tariffs fragment markets and limit trade, precisely because companies want to reduce the taxes they pay – and allocate production accordingly around the world.
考虑一下这种情况。 法国有着欧盟中最高的人口出生率（每个妇女有差不多两个孩子 ） ， 甚至比人口激增的爱尔兰还要高。	Consider this: France has the highest fertility rate in the European Union (just under two children per woman), even ahead of booming Ireland.
最近，哈佛大学心理学家史蒂文·平克（Steven Pinker）出版了一本书，记录了各项福利的长期积极趋势，他称之为“启蒙的成果 ” 。	Recently, the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker published a book documenting long-term positive trends in multiple dimensions of wellbeing, which he calls “the fruits of the Enlightenment.”
但在公开场合发表这样的言论已经不再起作用了。 这倒不是因为罗马尼亚人不认同这样的观点（许多人也这么认为 ） ， 而是从左翼到右翼的政治阶层都想成为欧洲的一部分因而会与任何危及这一愿望的人划清界限。	But saying that publicly won't work anymore, not because Romanians do not think this way (many certainly do), but because the political class from left to right wants to be part of Europe and won't associate with anyone who puts that desire at risk.
技术进步在一个复杂而深度一体化的生态系统赵红发生，这意味着它同时影响着经济结构、政府、安全安排和人们的日常生活。	Technological progress is occurring within a complex and deeply integrated ecosystem, meaning that it simultaneously affects economic structures, governments, security arrangements, and people's daily lives.
提振名义GDP的三大因素 — — 真实产出增加、出口相对价格上涨和实际汇率升值 — — 并不是逐一独立作用的。	The three phenomena that boost nominal GDP – increases in real output, a rise in the relative price of exports, and real exchange-rate appreciation – do not operate independently of one another.
由于许多苏格兰人 — — 其中62％的人投票支持留在欧盟 — — 都非常厌恶在英格兰民族主义的束缚下被英国保守党政府拖入一场硬脱欧进程，苏格兰独立的选项就变得难以抗拒。	With many Scots – 62% of whom voted to remain in the EU – leery of being dragged into a hard Brexit by a Conservative UK government in thrall to English nationalism, the case for Scottish independence could be compelling.
但是通过称之为战争、并把基地组织及其领导人本拉登点名为对手，美国政府给某些国内变化提供了理由。 这些国内变化在9/11袭击之前是不会被任何自由国家所接受的。	By calling them war – and naming an opponent, usually al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden – the United States government has justified domestic changes that, before the 9/11 attacks, would have been unacceptable in any free country.
这样的背信弃义令印度民众作呕，而9月印度人又被迫为再次发生的袭击事件哀悼，那次跨境袭击中某陆军基地的18名士兵因此死亡。	Indians, sickened by this perfidy, found themselves mourning again in September, when another cross-border assault killed 18 soldiers at an Army base in Uri.
为罹患疟疾的孩子寻医问药的家长，为孩子的上学奔波的家长，都必须自掏腰包 — — 这对很多家庭来说成为不可能的任务。	Parents seeking treatment for a malaria-stricken child, or a place for that child in school, must pay from their own pocket – an impossibility for many.
如果从现在开始增加卫生投资，那么到2030年，我们可以大幅接近所有家长都不会因为可预防原因失去孩子 — — 所有孩子也不会因为可预防原因失去一位双亲的目标。	If we increase investments in health now, by 2030 we can be that much closer to a world in which no parent loses a child – and no child loses a parent – to preventable causes.
战略核武器重新成为世界政治的中心议题不仅提升了俄罗斯的政治分量，还把国际社会的目光重新聚焦在了这个俄罗斯依然可以以世界强权自居的领域。	The return of strategic nuclear weapons to the center of world politics increases Russia’s political weight and highlights the field in which Russia can still assert itself as a superpower.
这是在1995年发生的事情，当时货币基金组织开始鼓吹资本性账户的自由化，在亚洲金融危机时候实行过度紧缩银根的财政拯救方案，并试图单枪匹马的扭转亚洲经济。	That is what happened in the second half of the 1990’s, as the IMF began to preach capital-account liberalization, applied over-stringent fiscal remedies during the Asian financial crisis, and single-handedly tried to reshape Asian economies.
在过去十年中至少有20个国家建立了由国家出资赞助的战略投资基金，与私营部门合作伙伴共同投资基础设施项目。	Over the last decade, at least 20 countries have established state-sponsored strategic investment funds to co-invest in infrastructure projects with private-sector partners.
我最近在第五大道上的以马内利会堂 — — 这里堪称纽约最美轮美奂的犹太教堂，也是世界最大的犹太教堂之一 — — 接受了《纽约时报书评 》 （ New York Times Book Review）编辑帕梅拉·保罗（Pamela Paul）的采访。	At Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue, the most beautiful synagogue in New York and one of the largest in the world, I was recently interviewed by Pamela Paul, editor of the New York Times Book Review.
诺贝尔奖获得者、凯恩斯的反对者罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）在2008年承认 ： “ 我猜每个人都是隐藏很深的凯恩斯主义者 。 ”	As the Nobel laureate Robert Lucas, an opponent of Keynes, admitted in 2008: “I guess everyone is a Keynesian in a foxhole.”
）结果表明，只有少数国家的再分配造成了10点以上的基尼系数变化，并且再平衡���动的基尼系数波动如果超过13点，将对增长造成消极影响。	They show that only a handful of countries redistribute enough to make more than a ten-point difference in the coefficient, and that redistribution-fueled swings of more than 13 points do tend to have an adverse effect on growth.
首先，巴西石油和Prominp就具体的技能 — — 比如船坞焊接、管接和石油工程 — — 制定五年期人才规划项目。	First, Petrobras and Prominp develop a five-year personnel projection in specific skill areas, such as shipyard welding, pipefitting, and petroleum engineering.
巴黎—德国财政部长朔伊布勒最近将希腊退出欧元的选项摆上了台面，他希望释放一个信号，即，任何一个成员国都不能免于货币联盟严格纪律的约束。	PARIS – When Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, recently tabled the option of a Greek exit from the euro, he wanted to signal that no member could abstain from the monetary union’s strict disciplines.
由于美国共和党人幼稚的政治固执导致该国政治瘫痪，而欧洲则着眼于确保设计拙劣的欧元计划能够幸存，因而达沃斯会议上最主要的抱怨就是全球领袖的缺失。	With the US politically paralyzed by the Republicans’ infantile political tantrums, and Europe focused on ensuring the survival of the ill-conceived euro project, the lack of global leadership was a major complaint at Davos.
根据中共中央统战部官员徐志涛所说，所谓“噶玛巴（可能）是中国特工或间谍的指控反映出印方对中方一贯持有的不信任态度 。 ”	According to Xu Zhitao, an official at the Chinese Communist Party central committee’s United Front Work Department, the allegation that “the Karmapa [may be] a Chinese agent or spy shows that India is keeping its mistrustful attitude toward China.”
九十年代，冷战刚刚结束后的一个短暂时间，世界看似好像会永久和平，不会受到国力的困扰，这一时代已经一去不复返了。	Gone are the 1990’s, when for a brief moment in the immediate aftermath of the end of the Cold War, the world looked as if it would be permanently peaceful and unconcerned with power.
数十亿消费者将步入各自国家的中产阶级行列，新的社会网络正在演化生成，气候变化也在日益成为全球商业的重要影响因素。	As that happens, billions of consumers will enter these countries’ middle classes, new social networks will evolve, and climate change will become a growing factor in global commerce.
据无党派立场的国会预算办公室（CBO）的测算，美国金融健康也会受到影响，到2027年将产生大约1.214万亿美元的新增赤字。	And, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, America’s financial health will suffer as well, with an estimated $1.214 trillion added to the deficit by 2027.
伯克利 — — 国际货币基金组织总裁克里斯蒂娜•拉加德不久前发出警告：增长放缓的“平庸常态”正摆在世人面前。	BERKELEY – Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, recently warned that the world risks a new “mediocre normal” of slower growth.
CIYOTA是一个位于克扬瓦力（Kyangwali）难民安置营的由年轻人领导的志愿组织。 在尼日利亚，布鲁明·索因卡（Blooming Soyinka）的非洲花朵（Africa Blooms）组织雇用了六位经济困难的残疾工匠，为这些雇员和她们的家庭创造不断改善和教育子女的条件。	In Nigeria, Blooming Soyinka employs a half-dozen economically disadvantaged and disabled artisans at Africa Blooms, creating conditions for those employees and their families to thrive and educate their children.
在关闭关塔纳摩，禁止酷刑之后，我们必须撤销《爱国者法案 》 ， 从而恢复宪法对于毫无法律根据的窃听和监视的约束力。	“After closing Guantánamo Bay and forbidding torture, we must repeal the Patriot Act, thereby restoring the Constitution’s restraints against warrantless wiretapping and surveillance.
作为世界第二大外国直接投资来源地，欧盟有着卓著的影响力，欧洲投资者给项目和地区带来信誉，从而有利于吸引更多投资。	As the world’s second-largest source of foreign direct investment, the EU wields considerable influence, with European investors bringing credibility to projects and regions, thereby serving to attract further investment.
美国的集中财政也使得各州得以在真正的预算平衡状态下运转，只消有相对较小的“雨天”基金予以调节就行了。	The centralized fiscal role in the US also allows all of the individual states to operate with true balanced budgets, modified only by relatively small “rainy day” funds.
实验经济学家发现人们会牺牲自己的资源去惩罚那些作弊者和占便宜的人，并会将此施加于那些永远不会与之发生互动的陌生人身上 — — 一种被称为“利他性惩罚”的行为。	Experimental economists have found that people will sacrifice their own resources to punish cheaters and free riders, and will do this even to anonymous strangers that they will never again interact with – a behavior dubbed “altruistic punishment.”
与此相反，在欧洲人眼中，一些美国人是极端个人主义的代表；在某种程度上，美国式的乐观主义也被解读为难以接受的社会丑闻。	By contrast, when the personal situations of many individual Americans are examined through European eyes, the extreme individualism that constitutes a key part of American optimism translates into an unacceptable social scandal.
对于作为发达国家一员的美国来说，如果削减温室气体排放所导致的高额成本和税收意味着降低经济复苏的速度，那么政府当然也不会接受强加于其身上的大幅减排限额。	The United States, for one, will not accept ceilings that reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions significantly if it means accepting higher costs and taxes that risk slowing economic recovery.
“如果把所有经济学家放到一起 ， ” 萧伯纳曾经做过著名的总结 ， “ 他们不会得到任何结论 。 ”	“If all the economists were laid end to end,” George Bernard Shaw famously quipped, “they would not reach a conclusion.”
当然，新评分标准不仅对企业本身、而且对试图在“拉动”机制和目前的优先药物需求间达成平衡的决策者也非常重要。	And, of course, the new scoring will also be important to the companies themselves, and for policymakers who are trying to strike a balance between “pull” incentives and current priority-drug needs.
伊斯兰世界内部同样存在着阿拉伯人和非阿拉伯人，逊尼派和什叶派，原教旨主义分子和神学温和派人士之间的冲突。	The Islamic world is riven by disputes between Arab and non-Arab, Sunni and Shia, and Salafi extremists and theological moderates.
构建信任进程是为了克服绥靖和强硬政策的局限性：绥靖政策完全取决于朝鲜似有若无的善意，而强硬政策则意味着无情施压。	The trust-building process was formulated to overcome the limitations of both appeasement and hardline policies: while the former depended entirely on the North’s tenuous good faith, the latter implied only relentless pressure.
必须避免做出那些导致空中楼阁计划以及非理性预期的过度乐观估计，因为刚刚摆脱内战的当地政府将无力完成这些项目，当年在危地马拉发生的一切就是一个例子。	Avoid overly optimistic projections that lead to unworkable plans and unreasonable expectations, which the government will not be able to fulfill, as happened in Guatemala, for example, when its civil war ended.
这也意味着，如果希腊可以走出当前的衰退，那么不管按绝对水平还是按占GDP比重计算，其国民债务都将减少。	This also implies that if Greece could escape from its current recession, its national debt would decline, both absolutely and as a share of GDP.
如果公共就业过去三年的增长速度能像乔治·W·布什总统任期时那样与人口的增长速度相等，那么这800,000个新增就业岗位将使失业率维持在7%左右，而不是8.2 % 。	If public employment had grown during the last three years at about the same rate as the population, as it did during George W. Bush’s presidency, the unemployment rate would be around 7% rather than 8.2%, owing to about 800,000 additional jobs.
乌克兰再供款的利率是16 % ， 低于通货膨胀10 % ， 这就意味者乌克兰的年度利率是负10 % 。	Ukraine’s current refinance rate is 16% a year, 10% less than inflation, which means that Ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10% a year.
里德在谈到史蒂夫·努钦（Steve Mnuchin ） — —前高盛执行副总裁 — — 就任财政部长的合适性时正是持有这一观点：	Reed made precisely this point in speaking to the suitability of Steve Mnuchin – a former Goldman Sachs executive vice president – as Treasury Secretary:
当非洲国家发展起来之后，国内状况会得到足够的改善，吸引人才流回祖国，数量大增的流失人才的确实是会回去的，印度、韩国和中国就是明证。	When development has taken off, and conditions have improved sufficiently to attract people back to their homelands, the hugely increased diaspora would indeed return, as they have done in India, South Korea, and China.
1997年，在捷克共和国、匈牙利和波兰正式加入欧盟两年前，欧盟与俄罗斯达成协议 — — 也就是所谓的成立法案 — — 以缓冲由此带来的影响。	In 1997, two years before the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland became full members, the Alliance reached an agreement with Russia – the so-called Founding Act – to cushion the impact.
其中之一是约旦河西岸法塔赫基层组织领导人马尔万·巴尔毫迪，此人现正在以色列监狱中服刑，罪名是领导了2000年爆发的流血叛乱，并直接参与策划多起谋杀以色列平民的事件。	Marwan Barghouti, the leader of Fatah’s grassroots group on the West Bank, is now in an Israeli prison for organizing the bloody uprising that began in 2000, and for direct involvement in planning the killings of many Israeli civilians.
不再梦想欧洲的欧洲人 — — 他们把和平、妥协以及最重要的自由视为理所当然 — — 没有意识到事态的严重性。	Europeans who have stopped dreaming about Europe, who take peace, reconciliation, and above all freedom for granted, do not realize what is at stake.
即便经济学家无法为这种迅速且激进的变革构建出模型，他们也不应该受到谴责，因为这只不过反映了我们当前的知识水平，以及经济学真的非常、非常复杂的现实。	Economists’ inability to model such rapid, radical change should not be taken as a condemnation of the discipline; it is simply a reflection of the state of our knowledge, and of the fact that the economy is really, really complicated.
政策制定者（也许还有金融市场）可能认为中央银行会通过激进的非常规货币政策（这是用来压制短期及长期利率的）来提供足够的桥接功能。	Policymakers (and perhaps financial markets) may have believed that central banks would provide an adequate bridging function through aggressive unconventional monetary policy designed to hold down short- and long-term interest rates.
与此同时，一名盲人人权分子从非法软禁他的家中逃了出来，跑到了美国驻北京大使馆寻求避难，随后在声明自己家人遭到所在地当局威胁后才离开了使馆。	Meanwhile, a blind human-rights activist escapes from illegal house arrest, finds refuge in the United States’ embassy in Beijing, and leaves the compound only after claims that Chinese authorities in his hometown had threatened his family.
如果承诺投入早期阶段的资金能在未来五年内持续到位，那么总额可能达到我们在审查报告中所提议的20亿美元。	If the amount of money that has been pledged for early-stage funding is sustained over the next five years, the total could reach the $2 billion that we recommended in the Review.
首先，先行财政紧缩 — — 不管多么必不可少 — — 在加速经济收缩，因为更高的税收和更低的政府支出和转移支付拉低了可支配收入和总需求。	First, front-loaded fiscal austerity – however necessary – is accelerating the contraction, as higher taxes and lower government spending and transfer payments reduce disposable income and aggregate demand.
比如说，统计人员也在绞尽脑汁地思考如何统计消费者因数字化而实现的质量提升和传递速度加快所带来的益处。	Statisticians struggle, for example, to account for how consumers are benefiting from the increased quality and speed of delivery that often results from digitalization.
现在，美国不应该重复“这与伊斯兰教无关”之类的老生常谈，而应该承认美国已经成为激进伊斯兰与开明伊斯兰和法治之间的战斗的新战场。	Instead of repeating like a broken record that “this has nothing to do with Islam,” it is time to admit that the US has become yet another theater in the battle between the Islam of the radicals and the Islam of enlightenment and the rule of law.
让其接受“政府问责局（Government Accountability Office ） “ 审计”的法案有望在国会两院获得通过。	"Bills subjecting the United States' central bank to “auditing"" by the Government Accountability Office are likely to be passed by both houses of Congress."
几年前，一部俄罗斯电影径直以《1672》为题，直指俄罗斯历史上的动荡年代（Time of Troubles ） ， 当时，领导不力导致俄罗斯受到波兰贵族和资本家的侵略而亡国。	A few years ago, a Russian film simply entitled 1612 evoked the Time of Troubles, when weak leadership caused Russia to be invaded and subverted by insidious Polish aristocrats and capitalists.
机器人时代正在来临，或者它来得不如我们想的那么快；当它真的来临时，机器人把所有人都失业，或者它们会创造和毁掉的一样多的岗位。	The robots are coming, or they’re not coming as fast as we think; when they do come, they’ll put everyone out of work, or they’ll create as many jobs as they destroy.
在网络化的世界中，我们做的每一件事都会影响他人，我们必须学会超越自我意识，追求合作、共创、共同进化和集体智慧。	In a networked world, where everything we do affects others, we must learn to think beyond ourselves, and pursue cooperation, co-creation, co-evolution, and collective intelligence.
今年5月，巴拿马当局扣留了一艘载有磷酸盐的驶往加拿大的船只，这艘船上的磷酸盐是由一家国有摩洛哥企业在在西撒哈拉占领区非法开采的。	This past May, the Panamanian authorities detained a Canada-bound ship carrying phosphates that had been illegally mined by a state-owned Moroccan company in occupied Western Sahara.
��5或10种不同的政府赞助且需要公众竞相购买的基金的突然出现将向市场传达一个讯息，即在这种环境之下，其他人在为资产估值时会使用什么模式。	And the sudden appearance of between five and ten different government-sponsored funds that make public bids for assets will convey information to the markets about what models other people are using to try to value assets in this environment.
确实，尽管前所未有的危机后美联储资产大概翻了三倍到3万亿美元 — — 并可能在未来一年内达到4万亿美元，美国的消费还是前所未有的回落了。	Indeed, notwithstanding an unprecedented post-crisis tripling of Fed assets to roughly $3 trillion – probably on their way to $4 trillion over the next year – US consumers have pulled back as never before.
通过量化宽松实现的激进的货币扩张在欧元区也更加复杂、更具政治正义性，因为作为货币区的欧元区不存在可供中央银行购买的联邦债务。	Aggressive monetary expansion through quantitative easing is also far more complicated and politically contentious in a currency area with no federal debt for the central bank to buy.
大国不可避免地可以做更多的事情来控制经济，因此也就更为受到诱惑实行干预来应对来自既得利益集团的政治压力。	A larger state can inevitably do more to control the economy, and hence is exposed to the costly temptation to intervene in response to political pressure from vested interests.
3年之后，一个以巴基斯坦为基地的恐怖分子团队在印度的金融中心孟买大开杀戒，扼杀了超过160条生命 — — 也扼杀了由此次板球比赛所开创的外交局面。	Three years later, a Pakistan-based terrorist group killed more than 160 people in Mumbai, India’s financial capital – and, with them, the diplomatic opening initiated by cricket.
与此同时，新技术提高了高技能工人的需求，同时降低了低技能工人的需求 — — 这一趋势令高技能和低技能工人之间的工资差距雪上加霜。	Meanwhile, new technologies raise demand for skilled workers, while reducing demand for their less-skilled counterparts – a trend that fuels the expansion of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled.
同样，随着欧盟演进为一个联邦国家，其忠诚的公民会拒绝基于种族亲缘性的民族主义并转而认同联邦宪法的民主原则。	Similarly, as the EU evolved into a federal state, its loyal citizens would reject nationalism based on ethnic affinities and instead identify with the democratic principles of the federation’s constitution.
而近年来，像杰里米·科尔宾这样的政界人士在成为英国工党领袖之前，支持自己的国家退出北约，而退出的理由恰恰是因为北约致力于以武力为手段展开共同防御。	And in recent years, politicians like Jeremy Corbyn, before he became leader of the UK Labour Party, have supported withdrawing their countries from the alliance, precisely because it is committed to using force as a means of mutual defense.
非洲大湖区持续不断的暴力活动已经夺去了数百万民众的生命，究其根源是因为1994年卢旺达的种族灭绝和胡图族难民大批涌入邻国。	The ongoing violence in Africa’s Great Lakes region, which has claimed millions of civilian lives, is rooted in the 1994 Rwanda genocide and the resulting flood of Hutu refugees into neighboring states.
报纸的头条刊登着各种各样的新的就业信息，但这仍然满足不了那些即将步入劳动市场的年轻人的就业需要。 这些消息对那些想要再次获得就业机会的50岁左右的人们来意义并不是很大。	Headlines announcing new hiring – still not enough to keep pace with the number of those who would normally have entered the labor force – meant little to the 50 year olds with little hope of ever holding a job again.
据最新的麦肯锡全球研究所报告，最为数字化的部门 — — 通过数字资产、数字用途和数字劳动力等十八个指标排序 — — 所获得的利润率显著高于传统部门。	According to a recent McKinsey Global Institute report, the most digitized sectors – ranked by 18 metrics on digital assets, digital usage, and digital workforce – enjoy significantly higher profit margins than traditional sectors.
最后，在其任期的第二年，奥巴马必须“设定更高的目标 ” — — 如同他去年夏天在全美有色人种协进会（ NAACP ）的一次演讲中所言。	Finally, in his second year, Obama must, as he put it last summer in a speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), “aim higher.”
悲哀的是，目前只有科威特和迪拜开始允许PPP，而只有沙特阿拉伯想要私有化机场（Jeddah和Dammam ） 。	Sadly, only Kuwait and Dubai have so far moved to allow PPPs, while only Saudi Arabia intends to privatize airports (Jeddah and Dammam).
在单一货币实施的第一个十年里，私人投资者相信所有欧元区主权债券一样安全，这使得外围国的利率也十分低，尽管其政府存在巨大的赤字，积累了巨额债务。	During the single currency’s first decade, private investors’ belief in the equality of all eurozone sovereign bonds kept interest rates low in the peripheral countries, even as their governments ran up large deficits and accumulated massive debt.
据医学研究所（Institute of Medicine）估计，光是在美国，每年就有7,500亿美元 — — 约占医疗总支出的30 % — —被“浪费在不必要的服务、过高的行政成本、欺诈和其他问题上 。 ”	The Institute of Medicine estimates that in the United States alone, some $750 billion a year – about 30% of total health-care spending – is “wasted on unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud, and other problems.”
乌克兰反对派团体致力于建立一个同普京总统领导之下的俄国截然不同的市民社会以及健康的政党，为此可谓历经万难。	Against all odds, Ukraine's opposition groups have helped forge a civil society and healthy political parties far beyond anything seen in President Vladimir Putin's Russia.
英格兰银行货币政策委员会的投票制度决定了其行长比较难以获知什么时候会出现大部分人支持紧缩的情况，而一些成员的观点，在最近几个月中左右摇摆。	The voting system used by the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee makes it harder for the governor to know when a majority for tightening will emerge, and some members’ views have been oscillating in recent months.
各国政府需要采取行动保护现有生态系统，恢复和扩大遭到破坏的生态系统 — — 并且以以人为本的方式实现。	Governments will need to take action to conserve existing ecosystems – and restore and expand degraded ecosystems – in people-friendly ways.
鉴于美韩两国对反映朝鲜核进展的情报做出了相同的评估，更不用说韩国在面临核威胁时表现出来的脆弱性，两国未能达成实际协议的确是非常令人不安的结果。	Given that the US and South Korea have the same assessment of the intelligence regarding North Korea’s nuclear progress, not to mention South Korea’s vulnerability, their failure to reach a practical agreement is troubling.
尽管2017年的美国陷入了深度分裂，但美国人民仍然对民主的核心原则坚定不移：自由、公平、定期的选举以及对政治、宗教和经济自由的保护。	Although America in 2017 is deeply divided, Americans remain committed to the central tenets of democracy: free, fair, and regular elections and the protection of political, religious, and economic liberty.
为了证明这不仅仅是一种理论假设，巩固财政的支持者举出20世纪80年代前期的丹麦、80年代后期的爱尔兰和20世纪90年代的芬兰作为例证。	As evidence that this is not merely a hypothetical possibility, advocates of fiscal consolidation point to cases like Denmark in the early 1980’s, Ireland in the late 1980’s, and Finland in the 1990’s.
许多人似乎认为，仅仅由于在过去十年中美国经济增长快于欧洲和日本，因而在以后的二十年里也是如此。 这一观点不可思议。	It is curious how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years simply because it has done so for the past ten years.
此外，那些发出“分裂”警告的人都忽视了一个事实：欧盟以及货币联盟的构建一直以来都是以不同的速度在推进。	Moreover, alarmist talk of a “split” overlooks the reality that the EU and the monetary union have long been moving at different speeds.
托克维尔的噩梦还没有在美国的现实中出现，但俄罗斯、土耳其、匈牙利（也许还有波兰）的情况已经与此不远。	De Tocqueville’s nightmare is not yet the reality in the US, but it is close to what we see in Russia, Turkey, Hungary, and perhaps Poland.
眼看着自己与萨利赫的关系逐渐恶化而自身的影响力日渐衰微，阿赫玛尔意识到自己对萨利赫的忠诚已经成为了一种负担。	His relationship with Saleh frayed and his influence waning, al-Ahmar understood that his loyalty to Saleh had become a liability.
而波兰新任欧洲事务部长西曼斯基（Konrad Szymanski）在巴黎袭击发生不到24小时就用该事件指责欧洲的缺陷。	And Poland’s new European affairs minister, Konrad Szymanski, did not wait 24 hours after the Paris attacks before using them to denounce Europe’s flaws.
联合国儿童基金会报告，只要采取用肥皂洗手等简单的措施，就能让腹泻和呼吸系统感染发病率分别降低40%和25 % 。	UNICEF reports that something as simple as hand washing with soap can cut rates of diarrhea and respiratory infections by more than 40% and 25%, respectively.
它还将带来巨大的经济增长，或许会让欧盟GDP增加120亿欧元（合127亿美元 ） ， 同时支持双方的商品和服务贸易增长近25 % 。	It will also provide a substantial economic boost, possibly adding around €12 billion ($12.7 billion) to the EU’s GDP, while underpinning a nearly 25% increase in the trade of goods and services for both sides.
这有利于增加基础设施投资，如若增幅能达到GDP的1 % ， 则可以让印度增加340万个工作岗位，美国增加150万个，巴西增加130万个，印度尼西亚增加700,000个。	This would facilitate higher infrastructure investment, with an increase equivalent to 1% of GDP translating into an additional 3.4 million jobs in India, 1.5 million in the United States, 1.3 million in Brazil, and 700,000 in Indonesia.
乐观者会说，这是与其说是因为厌恶布鲁塞尔或斯特拉斯堡本身，毋宁说是因为公众结成了一个“更加欧洲”的联盟，它有一个技术官僚的重点：单一市场和缺少有吸引力的替代模式。	Optimists might say that this is due less to aversion to Brussels or Strasbourg per se than to the public’s association of “more Europe” with a technocratic focus on the single market and the absence of an appealing alternative model.
首先，美国的干预在过去十年里耗费了数万亿美元和数千条人命，却一直在动摇中东，给受影响国家造成了巨大灾难。	First, US interventions, which have cost the country trillions of dollars and thousands of lives over the past decade, have consistently destabilized the Middle East, while causing massive suffering in the affected countries.
欧洲铁路交通管理系统（European Rail Traffic Management System）克服了不同成员国之间安全和安保标准不一致的问题，建立了一个统一的系统。 这只是这一创新性战略所促成的诸多成功例子中的一个。	The European Rail Traffic Management System, which has overcome divergent safety and security standards among member states to create a unified system, is but one of the many successes that this innovative strategy has facilitated.
非理性繁荣的参与者根本没想过如果当局出手维持经济以及信贷流（或者在极端情况下援助银行或者企业）后自己收回多少。	The irrationally exuberant were not thinking of the returns they would garner if the authorities intervened to maintain the economy and the flow of credit (or, in extreme cases, moved to bail out their bank or enterprise).
第一个认为所有真相都是相对的以及所有信息都是一种反映了社会权力关系的宣传的那个人，早已被桑托勒姆及其支持者们排除在了自己的世界之外。	The first people to argue that all truth is relative, and that all information is a form of propaganda that reflects society’s power relations, were far removed from the world inhabited by Santorum and his supporters.
但另外一项远没有那么稳定的世界纪录归属于北极冰本身：截至今年3月，北极冰已经缩减到有记录以来的最小规模。	But another record, this one far less stable, belongs to the Arctic ice itself: by March of this year, it had shrunk to the smallest size ever recorded.
本阿里的女婿 萨克赫尔·马泰（ Sakhr el-Materi ）去年通过选举进入了执政的宪政民主联盟党中央委员会。	Ben Ali’s son-in-law, Sakhr el-Materi, was last year elected to the central committee of the ruling Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique party.
