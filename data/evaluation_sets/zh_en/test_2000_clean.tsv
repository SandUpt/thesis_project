印度储备银行行长拉古兰·拉詹（Raghuram Rajan）最近呼吁发达经济体央行通过国际合作顾及新兴市场国家的利益。	Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has recently called for the advanced economies’ central banks to take emerging-market countries’ interests into account via international cooperation.
当然，这并没有使共产党不那么讨厌自由的媒体和欣欣向荣的文明社会，正是它们可以提供重要的信息反馈以确保任何国家的福址。	It has not helped, of course, that the Communist Party loathes a free press and a robust civil society, both of which are essential information feedback loops in ensuring any country’s well-being.
人和人格，以及他们彼此的感觉，能够让小规模的债务看起来如同无法维持，也能够让大规模债务在握手间烟消云散。	People and their personalities, and the way they perceive one another, can make small debts seem unserviceable or large debts disappear with a handshake.
当弗拉基米尔•普京作为俄罗斯的新科总统在2000年到达巴黎时，他所带去的是一个简单而令人欣慰的信息。	When he first arrived in Paris in 2000 as the newly elected President of Russia, Vladimir Putin had a simple and reassuring message to convey.
美国成功的另一个原因是它像磁石一样吸引着来自世界各地最优秀的人才，他们为美国版的全球熔炉贡献着自身的才智和力量。	Another reason for America’s success is that it has been a magnet for the best and brightest from around the world, who have contributed their own talents and energy to the melting pot of America’s narrative.
布鲁塞尔 - - 美国引人入胜的总统大选或许吸引了所有的头条新闻，但是欧洲也在进行一场领导权的斗争。	BRUSSELS – America’s riveting presidential election campaign may be garnering all the headlines, but a leadership struggle is also underway in Europe.
答案就在以下事实。 由美国及其他八个太平洋经济体政府（澳大利亚、文莱、智利、马来西亚、新西兰、秘鲁、新加坡和越南）提出的跨太平洋合作伙伴关系协定（TTP）的目标并不仅是贸易。	The answer lies in the fact that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), launched by Obama and the governments of eight other Pacific economies – Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam – is not just about trade.
）专家认同可以控制疾病的传播速度，但不同意能“彻底遏制 ” 。 承诺或暗示能把传染病挡在国门之外或一旦传入将被立即消灭的官员今后将面对公众的怒火。	Experts agree that pandemics can be slowed, but not “contained.” Officials who promise – or imply – that they can keep this pandemic from their borders, or stop it once it has arrived, are setting themselves up for public outrage later.
但大部分过度储蓄、支出不足的国家并没有减少储蓄、增加支出；它们的经常项目盈余一直在增加，加剧了全球需求的疲软，因而拖累增长。	But most countries that were over-saving and under-spending have not saved less and spent more; their current-account surpluses have been growing, aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth.
20世纪30年代，当开放社会的敌人们威胁到欧洲时，至少有一个强大的对抗模式存在于英国以及（特别是）美国，受到罗斯福新政的有力支持。	When the enemies of the open society were threatening Europe during the 1930s, there was at least a powerful counter model in Britain, and especially the US, bolstered by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.
如果它们无法快速行动起来重塑自己作为可信、高效的选民利益代表的形象，它们就有可能沦为政治背景，让不负责任的民粹主义逐渐占据中心舞台。	If they do not act fast to re-establish themselves as credible and effective representatives of voters’ interests, they risk fading into the political background, allowing irresponsible populists gradually to take center stage.
传递私人讯息的公告牌能够如此容易的占领公共空间是因为俄罗斯的公共空间几乎是闲置的：国家和社会之间的交流即便是有也少得可怜，而公共辩论则几乎没有。	The billboards with their private messages were able to occupy public space so easily because in Russia public space is virtually empty: there's very little, if any, communication between state and society, and barely any public debate.
在当前环境中，地缘政治紧张升级、信任缺失以及对关键性机构的不尊重所形成的累积效应可能带来一次重大冲击，也有可能只是令投资条件出现恶化。	In the current context, the cumulative effect of rising geopolitical tensions, loss of trust, and disrespect for key institutions could produce either a large shock or just deteriorating conditions for investment.
公司的思维（通常暗地里如此）是，通过污染环境实现TSR最大化是可以接受的，只要给CSR项目做一些贡献作为补偿 — — 就好像在恒河里洗一洗就能带走一个人的罪恶一样。	The thinking, mostly implicit, is that maximizing TSR by polluting the environment is acceptable as long as some compensating contributions are made to CSR initiatives – the corporate equivalent of bathing in the Ganges to wash away one’s sins.
海外印度人也依然心系故土，境外汇款总额不断增长，在2008~2009年间达到了464亿美元，其中大部分是来自那些在海湾地区打工的印度蓝领工人。	Indians abroad stayed loyal to India: remittances from overseas Indians remained robust, reaching $46.4 billion in 2008-2009, the bulk of which came from the mainly blue-collar Indian expatriate community in the Gulf countries.
但是这些技术还没有成形，而且我们不能单纯地等待市场来实现这些技术，因为它们要求公共政策上复杂的改变来确保它们安全可靠以及可以为大众所接受。	Yet the technologies are not yet ready, and we can’t simply wait for the market to deliver them, because they require complex changes in public policy to ensure that they are safe, reliable, and acceptable to the broad public.
穆尔西所采纳的列宁主义的“民主集中制”如果持续下去，将是对旧国家组织中的新一代人及其盟友的崛起的挑衅，这甚至会导致内战的代价。	The Leninist “democratic centralism” to which Morsi seemed to have subscribed, if maintained, will be a standing provocation to the new generations and their allies in the old state apparatus to rise up, even at the price of civil war.
它让我想起了1989年秋天布拉格温塞拉斯广场上回荡的键音 ― ― 后来这种声音响彻当时捷克斯洛伐克的其它地方。	It reminds me of the jingle of keys that rang out on Prague’s Wenceslas Square -- and later around the rest of what was then Czechoslovakia -- in the autumn of 1989.
但中国领导人必须认识到，中国面连着大规模福利损失，因此需要拿出接受短期增长放缓以换取更稳定的长期增长路径的意愿。	But China’s leaders must recognize that the country faces massive welfare losses, and thus should be willing to accept slower growth in the short term in exchange for a more stable long-term growth path.
虽然该组织只不过是将白俄罗斯、亚美尼亚、哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、乌兹别克斯坦以及俄罗斯间的双边军事协议强行堆砌在一起，而对此克林姆林宫当局依然感觉良好，安之若素。	For all this, the Kremlin is not in the least embarrassed by the fact that the CSTO is essentially a mechanical connection of bilateral military agreements between Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia.
随着国民政治冷淡程度达到了1930年代那段最黑暗时期以来的高点，欧洲屈服于破坏性民粹主义力量的风险也日渐增大。	With political disenchantment reaching levels not seen since the continent’s darkest times in the 1930s, the risk that Europe will succumb to the destructive forces of populism looms ever larger.
在1945年后的最初三十年间，起主导作用的是布雷顿森林共识 — — 一个允许决策者在关注国内的社会和就业需要的同时，能够使全球 贸易恢复和繁荣的肤浅的多边主义。	The first three decades after 1945 were governed by the Bretton Woods consensus – a shallow multilateralism that permitted policymakers to focus on domestic social and employment needs while enabling global trade to recover and flourish.
该条约由罗纳德·里根和苏共总书记米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫于1987年签署，要求双方销毁地面发射的弹道导弹和巡航导弹，而美国的撤出则标志着新一轮军备竞赛的开始。	Signed in 1987 by Ronald Reagan and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, the INF required both the US and Russia to eliminate ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles. The US withdrawal from it signals the start of a new arms race.
这些结果的任何一个都有悖于中国的战略利益；但和许多政府一样，中国领导人将避免短期的艰难决定，即使这会导致长期的不利结果。	Any of these outcomes would be inconsistent with Chinese strategic interests; but, like many governments, China’s leaders will seek to avoid difficult decisions in the short run, even if this results in damaging outcomes over time.
叙利亚人权观察组织（Syrian Observatory for Human Rights）估算，在过去四年中，近250,000人被杀，包括100,000多名平民，其中有许多是被本国政府以骇人听闻的方式杀害的。	The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that, over the last four years, nearly 250,000 people have been killed, including more than 100,000 civilians, many of whom were killed in horrific ways by their own government.
尽管签署了明斯克 II停火协议，乌克兰依然被俄国支持的分离主义分子所部分占领， 间歇性的战斗仍在进行中。	Ukraine remains under partial occupation by Russian-backed separatists, with intermittent fighting still taking place, despite the Minsk II ceasefire agreement.
除了升级制造业之外，发展中国家应准备好实现向服务业的转型，因为随着收入的增加这是不可避免的 （尽管准确时间很难预测 ） 。	Beyond upgrading manufacturing, developing countries should be preparing for the shift toward services that they will inevitably undergo as incomes rise (though the precise timing is hard to predict).
随着金砖国家在全球经济中的作用越来越大，大型拉美国家与金砖国家保持一致，寻求更大的国际影响力倒也无可厚非。	Given their growing role in the global economy, it is understandable that larger Latin American countries, along with the other BRICS, are seeking a more influential world role.
但特朗普本人的不靠谱承诺 — — 包括在英国和墨西哥之间建设一道墙以及让制造业岗位从海外回到美国 — — 仍令许多选民深信不疑。	Yet Trump’s own implausible promises – including his pledges to construct a wall between the US and Mexico and bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas – still seem credible to many voters.
部分归因于政府的刺激政策，自2008年以来中国增长更多地是由投资而不是消费推动的，这阻碍了世界急需的需求再平衡的进展。	Partly owing to government stimulus measures, China’s growth since 2008 has been driven more by investment than by consumption, which has impeded the economy’s much-needed demand rebalancing.
比如，看起来十分温和的抵制、撤资和制裁运动（Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions，BDS ） — —其许多支持者视其为合法的非暴力抵制 — — 一直在不断赢得进展。	For example, the seemingly benign Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, viewed by many of its supporters as a legitimate form of non-violent resistance, has continued to gain ground.
森林还是一座巨大的“碳沉淀池 ” ， 数百年来存储了巨量大气二氧化碳；因此，保护森林有助于遏制气候变化。	"Forests also serve as an enormous “carbon sink,"" storing atmospheric carbon dioxide for many decades or centuries; thus, protecting forests would help to mitigate climate change."
美国的经济危机所引发的严重的信贷紧缩加剧了美国经济的衰退，而越来越深重的衰退正在引发金融市场更大规模的损失，从而损害更广层面的经济。	America’s financial crisis has triggered a severe credit crunch that is making the US recession worse, while the deepening recession is leading to larger losses in financial markets – thus undermining the wider economy.
希腊经济正在崩溃，人道主义危机日益严重，若无法达成协议，其政府将别无选择，只能印钱提供基本社会服务。	Given Greece’s collapsing economy and growing humanitarian crisis, the government will have no choice, absent an agreement, but to print money to fund basic social services.
更加糟糕的是，选举中的落败者洛佩兹，似乎更愿意让整个国家陷入混乱之中，而不愿意接受按照宪法他已经失败的事实。	Worst of all, the election loser, López Obrador, seems willing to throw the country into turmoil rather than accept the constitutional legitimacy of his defeat.
比如，据说位于佛罗里达州的范祖尔（Fanjul）兄弟阿方索（Alfonso）和何塞（José）就向1月份特朗普的就职典礼捐赠了五十万美元。	For example, the Florida-based Fanjul brothers, Alfonso and José, reportedly contributed a half-million dollars to Trump’s January inauguration.
财政纪律不应该优先于包含在新协议内的重要结构改革，特别是改进退休金、法律制度、产品市场、公共行政和司法的措施。	Fiscal discipline should not take priority over the important structural reforms included in the new deal, particularly measures to overhaul pensions, the legal system, product markets, public administration, and the judiciary.
由于政府苦于预算不足和债务上升，高科技行业正在接受日益严格的监督，在这样的背景下的这样一则消息让我有些怀疑这个决定。	Coming at a time when the technology industry is under increasing scrutiny in the developed world as governments struggle with budget shortfalls and rising debt, this seems to me to be a questionable decision.
自首相安倍晋三于2012年12月重新执政并实施他的货��和财政刺激以及结构性改革计划以来，对日本人信心的影响可谓深远。	Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe assumed office in December 2012 and launched his program of monetary and fiscal stimulus and structural reform, the impact on Japanese confidence has been profound.
但和中国不同的是，印度的下降势头更为显著 — — 2011年第三季度GDP增速低于7%的临界点，而10月年度工业总产值实际下降了5.1 % 。	But unlike China, the downshift is more pronounced – GDP growth fell through the 7% threshold in the third calendar-year quarter of 2011, and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1% in October.
大体上看，马萨诸塞州或者俄亥俄州每出现1美元的GDP下降，所引发的税率变更和转移支付就将冲抵其中40美分，也因此起到有效的财政刺激作用。	Roughly speaking, each dollar of GDP decline in a state like Massachusetts or Ohio triggers changes in taxes and transfers that offset about 40 cents of that drop, providing a substantial fiscal stimulus.
同时，已经存在的安全事务机构 — — 欧安组织（OSCE ） 、 北约-俄罗斯理事会（NATO-Russia Council）以及欧洲-大西洋合作伙伴理事会（Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council）等等 — — 应该得到强化，而为此设置新机构则没有必要。	Security initiatives should therefore first be discussed bilaterally within the NATO-EU framework; only then should a common position be presented at the OSCE. Speaking to Russia with one voice is absolutely essential.
这一决定是为了让彼得森集团能够偿付对银行和普雷索尔债务。 在股票收购中，彼得森集团并没有付钱，而是赊账向普雷索尔进行了收购。	That decision was intended to allow the Petersen Group to service the debts to banks, and to Repsol itself, that it incurred with its share purchase, for which it made no initial payment.
人们曾经希望产品和金融市场的彻底融合会暴露哪些低效行业，把资金流从发展迟缓的国家转移到更加高效的使用者。	It was expected that full integration of product and financial markets would expose inefficiencies, steering investment flows away from laggards towards the more efficient countries.
然而，对猛虎解放组织的胜利，不一定要排除某种保证泰米尔人有一些政治发言权的地方分权形式，只要这种地方自治的程度不至于破坏斯里兰卡的国家统一。	Nevertheless, victory over the Tigers need not rule out some form of decentralization that guarantees the Tamils some political say, so long as a degree of local autonomy does not destroy Sri Lanka’s unity.
相反，战争在国家和非国家行动方之间展开，比如尼日利亚和博科圣地组织（Boko Haram）之间，或印度和纳萨尔（Naxalite）叛军之间。	Instead, wars are between states and non-state actors – between, say, Nigeria and Boko Haram, or between India and its Naxalite insurgents.
对于她那些挥舞着口红的拥趸们来说，佩林是一个朴实、虔诚的“冰球母亲 ” ， 她喜欢捕猎美洲驼鹿、信仰福音教义以及甚至有些混乱的家庭生活，都显示她是一个真实的并且典型的美国人。	To her legions of lipstick-waving fans on the right, Palin is a down-to-earth, God-fearing “hockey mom” whose moose hunting, evangelical faith, and even chaotic family life are all evidence that she is a real, typical American.
更近的例子则有1994年导致80万人死亡的卢旺达大屠杀，以及1995年斯雷布雷尼察地区数千名波斯尼亚男性遭屠杀的事件，当时许多人都发誓不会再让这类惨剧重演。	More recently, after a genocide that cost nearly 800,000 lives in Rwanda in 1994, and the slaughter of Bosnian men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995, many people vowed that such atrocities should never again be allowed to occur.
我们希望《2005国防评估》会着手解决这一问题，虽然它肯定会回答一些战略问题而将其他的留在日后商榷。	One hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue, although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate.
在世界范围内，可再生能源业的就业增长正在蓬勃发展，而（主要因为燃煤电厂关闭 ） ， 传统发电业的就业状况却正在萎缩。	Worldwide, job growth in the renewables industry is booming, while employment in traditional power generation is shrinking (primarily owing to the closure of coal plants).
《华尔街日报》当然也为特朗普的举动欢呼，但同样欢呼的还有《华盛顿邮报》的大卫·伊格纳修斯，后者声称“领导的道德因素”现在终于进入了特朗普的白宫。	The Wall Street Journal hailed Trump’s move, of course, but so did the Washington Post’s David Ignatius, who claimed that “the moral dimensions of leadership” had now found its way into the Trump White House.
比如，寻求吸引投资的政府，可能会将经济利益置于与居民需求同等的地位，从而降低企业环境标准或税收负担。	For example, a government seeking to attract investment might equate economic interests with residents’ needs, and thus lower environmental standards or tax burdens for businesses.
与此同时，特朗普政府采取了极端的、不合道德的反移民政策，比如最近收回的在南部的美墨边境上将移民儿童和他们的家庭分开的政策。	Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pursued extreme and morally unconscionable anti-immigration policies, such as the recently reversed policy of separating migrant children from their families at the southern border with Mexico.
希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯不久前也采纳了类似的论调，宣称“所有进步、民主和亲欧洲的力量都有义务携手并肩站在同一条历史战线上 。 ”	Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras recently adopted similar rhetoric, declaring that “all progressive, democratic, and pro-European forces have a duty to stand side by side on the same side of history.”
这正是好奇心之所以成为一种激情的原因：它不受道德约束，遵从自己的规则。 这也就是为什么社会坚持要以不同的方式来驯服它。	That is precisely what makes it a passion: it is amoral and follows its own laws, which is why society insists on taming it in various ways.
特别值得一提的是，这本书 — — 再加上一篇由高级政府官员匿名撰写的纽约时报评论文章 — — 展示了助手们为阻止一位冷漠、无知和偏执的总统因一时冲动而作出某些灾难性举动可以无所不为到何种程度。	In particular, the book – together with an anonymous New York Times op-ed by a senior administration official – showed how far aides would go to keep an incurious, ignorant, and paranoid president from impulsively doing something disastrous.
从伊斯兰高等教育到伊斯兰银行和宗教官僚机关，马哈蒂尔和安瓦尔偷走了PAS的宗教威望 — — 直到巫统开始分裂。	From Islamic higher education to Islamic banking to religious bureaucracy, Mahathir and Anwar stole the PAS’s religious thunder – that is, until the UMNO split.
地方政府往往更加关注基础设施、教育和住房等涉及地方层面的部分关切 — — 而这些领域并没有受到全球化的大规模影响。	It helps that subnational governments tend to be focused on more local-level concerns – such as infrastructure, education, and housing – that are not perceived as being strongly influenced by globalization.
有些人天真地相信牛吃的是草，现在才发现饲喂肉牛的食品种类繁多，从谷物到鱼肉、养鸡场的垃圾稻草（包括鸡的排泻物）以及屠宰场的下脚料。	People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal, chicken litter (complete with chicken droppings), and slaughterhouse waste.
欧洲远景的失落所造成的影响在2008年秋次贷危机和雷曼倒闭的过程中展露无遗，德国总理默克尔一开始的反应极为民族主义，而且是彻底反欧洲的。	The impact of this lost European perspective became clear in the autumn of 2008 when, in the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-European.
《人民日报》下属的极端民族主义报纸《环球时报》似乎认为，最近在西方发生的恐怖袭击是民主启示录的先兆。	The Global Times, an ultra-nationalist tabloid affiliated with the People’s Daily, seemed to suggest that recent terrorist attacks in the West were a harbinger of some kind of democratic apocalypse.
最后，尽管今天谈论金本位可能给金融市场带来的规范作用，可是金本位国家却经常暂停兑换，这意味着本国货币不能自由兑换成黄金。	Finally, for all the talk today of the discipline that the gold standard supposedly provided, countries that adhered to it regularly suspended convertibility – meaning that the domestic currency could no longer be converted freely into gold.
尽管这些谬误并未让我们质疑全球变暖确实正在发生，确实是人为所致，而且确实将带来很多麻烦，但这些对 IPCC 的质疑也造成了极大的损害。	Although none of these lapses provides any reason to doubt that global warming is real, is man-made, and will create problems for us, these challenges to the IPCC are taking their toll.
如果是后者，那么必须要问一问，这三个经济体中的一个乃至全部是否会与流行的预期相反，将在这个十年余下的时间里给我们一个惊喜？	If it is the latter, one must ask whether, contrary to prevailing expectations, new developments or shifts in any or all three of these economies might surprise us on the upside for the rest of the decade.
对朝鲜战争没有个人记忆或兴趣不大的新几代韩国人显然对美国在南韩对北韩的“阳光政策”中作梗的行为感到憎恶。	New generations of South Koreans, who have no personal recollections of – and perhaps only casual interest in – the Korean War, apparently resent what they regard as America’s undermining South Korea’s “sunshine policy” toward North Korea.
比如，欧元区需要真正的银行联盟（不仅要有共同监督，也要有共同存款保险和共同清算机制）和欧元债券（或类似的债务共同化机制 ） 。	For example, the monetary union needs a real banking union – including not just common supervision, but also common deposit insurance and a common resolution mechanism – and Eurobonds, or some similar vehicle for mutualizing debt.
监管机构学到的智慧是一旦出了什么问题最好赶紧表示“我们早跟你说过了 ” ， 并且偶尔发出些负面警告几乎也没什么坏处。	The received wisdom among regulators is that they are better off being able to say, “We told you so” if something goes wrong, and that there is little downside in occasionally issuing dark warnings.
我最喜欢举的例子是电子病历（我的妻子是医生 ） ， 其中存在着巨大���潜力去以提高美国医疗保健服务的效率。	My favorite example is electronic medical records (my wife is a doctor), which have tremendous potential to enhance the efficiency of health-care delivery in the US.
要点在于跨出你的舒适区，让你自己与周边和你差不多的声音保持距离，并且记住董事要为他们的决定的直接和间接后果负责。	The point is to step outside of one’s comfort zones, distance oneself from the voices around the table that sound just like one’s own, and remember that board members are responsible for the direct and indirect impact of their decisions.
但一些观察者已经看到一些迹象表明这次冲击将带来更大的后果，发达经济体将陷入令人沮丧的反常长期低增长轨道。	But some observers already saw signs that this shock would prove more consequential, with the advanced economies finding themselves locked into a frustrating and unusual long-term low-growth trajectory.
上述发现让科研人员可以选择取得疗效机率更大的患者进入到研究小组，同时避免让可能疗效不佳的患者出现副作用。	Such discoveries have enhanced researchers’ ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug, while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit.
联合国的各成员国现在如何应对—特别是那些相信联合国的使命和价值的国家—可以在解决其它更为广泛的现时地区冲突中助一臂之力，特别是在都支持真主党的伊朗和叙利亚的事务方面。	How member states respond now – especially those who believe in the purpose and value of the UN - may help shape the outcomes of other, wider ongoing regional conflicts, notably with Iran and Syria, both of which support Hezbollah.
我们决不因为保护主义和民族主义政治而降经济分比起来，而必须构建公民与领导人之间的新的社会契约，让所有人在国内获得足够的安全感，保持经济基本对世界开放。	Rather than closing off economies through protectionism and nationalist politics, we must forge a new social compact between citizens and their leaders, so that everyone feels secure enough at home to remain open to the world at large.
事实上，缺乏有勇气的领导人已经使国际社会针对当前埃博拉疫情的有效反应来得太迟，从而大大增加了这次危机所付出的代价。	Indeed, the dearth of bold leadership has already delayed an effective international response to the current Ebola outbreak for far too long, drastically increasing the costs of the crisis.
他启动了对养老金和高等教育方面一直久拖不决的重大改革，在介入科特迪瓦和利比亚事务也做出了正确的选择。	He has also launched a major and long-overdue reform of the pension system and higher education. He made the right choices in intervening in Côte d’Ivoire and Libya.
法德两国政府最近决定推动共同开发新型战斗机的计划当然算是迈出了良好的第一步，但不要因此寄望能在不久的将来看到任何明显的合作成果。	The French and German governments recently decided to move ahead on a plan jointly to develop a new fighter jet, which is certainly a good first step. But one should not expect to see any spectacular cooperative achievements in the immediate future.
计划可能会在 《福克斯新闻》甚至《纽约时报》专家中引来不错的反响，这些所谓的专家会摸着自己的下巴惋惜民主党人否决特朗普慷慨的基础设施计划。	The plan will be well-received at Fox News, and possibly even by pundits at The New York Times, who might stroke their chins and lament that the Democrats are rejecting Trump’s open hand on infrastructure.
而每年流向当今发展中国家的数额近2.5万亿，即第三世界国家人均每年会得到500美金。 对于那些现在的日收入不足2美金的人而言，这几乎是他们年收入的一半了。	And about $2.5 trillion annually would go to today’s developing countries every year, or $500 a year on average for each individual in the third world, almost half of whom now survive on less than $2 a day.
这一结果对那些熟悉日本银行危机的人来说无比熟悉：僵尸银行贷款给僵尸公司，反而把压力施加到了有活力的企业身上，扼杀了它们的成长。	The result will look familiar to aficionados of Japan’s banking crisis: zombie banks lending to zombie firms, which apply artificial pressure on viable firms, stifling their growth.
而这在一定程度上还是要归功于这位老独裁者。 由于在其死前恢复了国王胡安▪卡洛斯领导下的君主政治，弗朗哥给西班牙提供了一个重建的基础。	Here the old dictator can take some credit, for by re-establishing the monarchy under King Juan Carlos just before he died, Franco provided Spain with a foundation on which to build anew.
总而言之，新兴经济体遭遇的是由外部产生的宏观经济转变，非常规货币政策，大范围的市场波动以及发达市场缓慢增长所带来的挑战。	In short, emerging economies have been challenged by externally generated macroeconomic shifts, unconventional monetary policies, widespread volatility, and slow growth in developed markets.
但叙利亚依然可以实现和平改革，只要国际社会承认一味强调叙利亚的“复杂国情”对其民众不利，就能够影响到和平改革进程的走势。	Peaceful change in Syria can nonetheless be achieved, and the international community can influence that process by recognizing that its continued focus on the country's “complexity” does nothing for its people.
比如，它容忍世界增长最快的核武国家巴基斯坦，尽管用特朗普的话说，巴基斯坦“满嘴荒唐言 ” ， 包括为“我们在阿富汗追捕的恐怖分子提供安全港 。 ”	For example, it tolerates the world’s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal in Pakistan, even though that country, in Trump’s words, has “given us nothing but lies and deceit,” including providing a “safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.”
但国际货币基金组织（IMF）等金融机构现在正在反驳这一“自有资金”的概念，指出政府的风险越高，项目就越不能被定义为的“表外 ” 。	But financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund are now pushing back against this notion of “free money,” by pointing out that the higher the risk for a government, the less a project can be defined as “off-book.”
他们发现在这一时期，当国内企业所得税率高于其他经合组织国家时，企业利润增长的平均值就会超过了 GDP 增长。	They find that, during that period, average corporate-profit growth outpaced GDP growth whenever the domestic corporate-income-tax rate exceeded that of other OECD countries.
IMF是全球金融稳定的法定监护人，预警和预防失败的问题远比其对英国紧缩的看法严重得多，前者会导致极大的代价，并且这些代价往往会影响到无数人，特别是最脆弱群体。	Given that the IMF is the world’s anointed guardian of financial stability, its failure to warn and preempt constitutes a far more grievous lapse than its position on British austerity, with huge costs borne by many, especially the most vulnerable.
而且，即使在胚胎发育时期引起它们之间差异的刺激物早就不存在了，这些细胞的特征也在各自的细胞谱系中分别得到了遗传。	Moreover, the cells’ features are inherited in their respective cell lineages, even though the stimuli that triggered the differences between them during embryonic development are long gone.
上个月，一条从埃及向以色列和约旦输送天然气的管道发生爆炸 — — 这是穆巴拉克政权倒台以来的第15起类似事件 — — 至今没有修复使用。	Last month, a pipeline carrying Egyptian natural gas to Israel and Jordan was bombed – the 15th such attack since Mubarak’s regime was toppled – and remains out of commission.
2016年7月，东盟外交部长会议在联合公报中也没有提到两周前国际仲裁庭所做出的不利于中国的标志性裁决。	In July 2016, ASEAN foreign ministers failed to mention in their joint communiqué the landmark ruling against China that had been issued just two weeks before by an international arbitral tribunal on the disputes.
因此，G20对IMF指导方案的支持对于一个正在试图从金融危机中复苏、同时又在预防危机重演的世界来说并不明智。	So, the G-20’s endorsement of the Fund’s guidelines would not be wise for a world economy trying to recover from one financial crisis while preventing the next one.
采用这一方法，发展中国家可以实现动态增长，形成就业创造和贫困减少的良性循环，即使其总体基础设施和营商环境仍然有所欠缺。	With this approach, a developing country can grow dynamically, and create a virtuous circle of job creation and poverty reduction, even if its overall infrastructure and business environment are still lacking.
比如，国有企业或许可以将它们建立的私募股权资金挂牌，同时将它们投资的国内高科技企业粉饰为潜在挂牌对象。	For example, SOEs may be able to list private-equity funds that they establish, while grooming domestic high-tech firms in which they invest for potential listings of their own.
但现实是，帮助境况类似于巴西的国家正是IMF这样的全球金融机构能够起到建设性作用的领域。 应该指出，今天的IMF比十年前更加灵活和开放。	But the reality is that helping countries in situations like Brazil’s is an area where global financial institutions like the IMF – which, it should be noted, is more flexible and open today than it was a decade ago – can play a constructive role.
为了重塑美国的道德领导力，总统奥巴马必须兑现他曾经说过的话，真正给受压迫的人民带去曙光 — — 如他在就任总统早期在伊斯坦布尔和开罗说的那样。	In order to restore America’s moral leadership, President Barack Obama must make good on his early rhetoric – exemplified in his speeches in Istanbul and Cairo early in his presidency – which demonstrated genuine regard for the oppressed.
显然，多米诺效应并不会止于此处：银行A和银行B的破产可能会把银行C — — 甚至更多的银行 — — 拖入险境。	Obviously, the domino effect need not stop there: the insolvency of banks A and B could get a bank C – and additional banks – into trouble.
如果消费开支一路上涨，我们则希望各国央行提高利率，降低基建开支的热度，从而释放防止通货膨胀和短缺所需的资源。	If consumers go on a spending binge, we expect the world's central banks to raise interest rates to cool off construction spending and free up the resources needed to prevent shortage-inducing inflation.
以色列政府或许是抓住这次残酷谋杀作为借口挑衅哈马斯，促使后者做出可以让以色列反对来入侵和摧毁连通加沙和以色列的地道。	The Israeli government may have seized on the outrageous murders as a pretext for provoking Hamas into a response that would allow Israel, in turn, to invade and destroy the tunnels Hamas has dug from Gaza into Israel.
而特朗普的竞选搭档、印第安纳州州长麦克·彭斯（Mike Pence）2000至2012年间在众议院供职，与众议院议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）和其他共和党领导人关系甚密。	And Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, Governor of Indiana, served in the House from 2000 to 2012 and has close ties to Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders.
同样，美国2003年在伊拉克发动的为期三周的“震慑行动”战役以“胜利”告终，但却为占领者和普通的伊拉克人打开了地狱之门。	Likewise, America’s three-week “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “victory,” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
在加上奥地利、荷兰和未加入欧元区的北欧国家 — — 瑞士、瑞典、丹麦和挪威，北欧国家去年经常项目盈余总量为5110亿美元。	Together with the surpluses of Austria, the Netherlands, and most non-eurozone northern countries – namely, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway – northern Europe has run a current-account surplus of $511 billion over the last 12 months.
虽然富裕女性可以也确实付钱给贫困女性承担照顾工作，但也有很多人选择兼职或弹性工作以便履行子女的鼓励和教育职责。	Although wealthy women can and do buy the care work of poorer women, many also choose to work part-time or flexibly to provide the stimulation and education their children need.
但只要关注重点恰当，他们可以用少得多的资源大幅提高粮仓质量，避免超过30%的粮食 — — 往往靠近那些贫困的农村人口 — — 变质到不适合人类食用。	But, with the right focus and much more modest resources, they could dramatically improve the quality of grain silos where more than 30% of food – typically located close to the rural poor – spoils to the point of being unfit for human consumption.
美国总统奥巴马在去年 11 月的首次访华，以及他所表现出的那种卑微而有求于人的形象，更加强了这种当今和未来两大强权之间可能达成协议的印象。	President Barack Obama’s first visit to China last November, in which he accepted the role of pliant suitor at the court of the emperor, strengthened the impression of a deal between today’s great power and tomorrow’s.
尽管我们历尽艰辛为妇女赢得了不少权益，但对于这个她们 — — 以及她们的孩子的健康和发育的关键问题，我们仍然比计划落后了一百年。	Despite hard-won gains for women, we remain a century behind schedule on an issue that is key to their health and development – and to that of their children.
但它也有极限，越过了极限，对央行财务健全性的信心 — — 以及对货币可靠性的信心 — — 就会受到破坏。	But there are limits beyond which confidence in the financial integrity of central banks – and consequently the soundness of money – will be undermined.
中东地区的威胁是巨大的，并且还在上升，全世界的人都在担心极端主义斗士回国以及一直呆在国内的人受恐怖主义影响。	The threat to the region is large and growing, and it menaces people everywhere, as extremist fighters return home and still others who never left are inspired to do terrible things.
发自华盛顿 — — 虽然沙特驻美大使阿德尔·朱拜尔在美国宣称挫败的暗杀阴谋中毫发未伤，但如果这一行动的真正目标并不是朱拜尔，而是为了破坏伊朗总统内贾德的外交政策的话，那么策划者的目的或许已经实现了。	WASHINGTON, DC – Though Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir is alive and well in Washington, the plot to assassinate him may have succeeded – if its aim was not to kill al-Jubeir, but rather Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s foreign policy.
一个不祥的新词已经悄悄潜入生命科学和生物制药研究 ： “ 生物安全 ” （ biosecirity ） 。	An ominous new word has crept into the life sciences and biomedical research: “biosecurity.”
他们让伊斯兰国得以兴盛 — — 甚至助了伊斯兰国一臂之力 — — 并给全球秩序造成日益严重的威胁，在沙姆沙伊赫、贝鲁特和巴黎接连发生的恐怖袭击悲剧地证明了这一点。	They have enabled – indeed, fueled – the rise of the Islamic State, and with it a growing threat to the global order, as the successive terrorist attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Beirut, and Paris tragically have shown.
除非从现在开始，否则战火将会在政治和宗教的助长下蔓延 — — 受害者也决不会仅限于尼尼微（Nineveh ） 。	Unless we start now, the fires will spread – fanned by politics and religion – and it will not only be Nineveh that is consumed by them.
经济学家信心十足地反对商品补贴，因为农业和能源市场接近于完美竞争，需求端有大量消费者，供给端有大量生产者。	Economists feel confident in opposing commodity subsidies because agricultural and energy markets tend to approach the ideal of perfect competition, with a large number of consumers on the demand side and producers on the supply side.
而且认为不必政治解决叙利亚冲突就能实现上述目标是个严重的错误，伊斯兰国实现爆炸性增长恰恰是借助冲突。	And it is a grave mistake to think that this can be achieved without a political solution to the conflict in Syria – the conflict that enabled the organization’s explosive growth.
考虑到遏制气候变化影响的政治压力，聪明的投资者将密切关注可能导致需求下降的政策信号以及他们的资产财务搁浅的可能性。	Given the political pressure to mitigate the impact of climate change, smart investors will be watching closely for indications of policies that will lead to a drop in demand and the possibility that their assets will become financially stranded.
所幸的是，包括学生、主导民意者以及最主要的是律师在内的巴基斯坦人民挺身支持法官，他们在做本来应该由政党来做的工作。	Fortunately, the people of Pakistan – students, opinion makers, and, above all, lawyers – are standing up for the judges, doing the work that should have been done by political parties.
各国政府和国际货币基金组织这样的机构在努力保持可持续经济复苏、为全世界人民谋福利的过程中必须把这一点铭记在心。	Governments and institutions like the IMF must keep this in mind as they seek to ensure a durable economic recovery that will benefit all of the world's people.
他的左翼联盟党（Syriza）在1月的大选中大获全胜，随后希腊总理齐普拉斯任命瓦鲁法基斯领衔与希腊债权人进行如履薄冰的谈判。	Following an impressive election victory by his Syriza party in January, Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, appointed Varoufakis to lead the delicate negotiations with the country’s creditors.
巴勒斯坦人已经从美国总统奥巴马的特使乔治·米切尔处得到了承诺，保证以色列人不会在未来4个月的间接谈判中作出任何“挑衅行动 ” 。	Palestinians have been assured via a message from President Barack Obama, delivered by his special envoy George Mitchell, that the Israelis will not carry out any “provocations” during the coming four months of indirect negotiations.
有些人无疑已经背叛了政府，其中最具影响力的当属霍姆斯暴行达到高潮后不久，能源部副部长辞职并加入到反对派阵营。	To be sure, the authorities have suffered some defections, with the most significant coming soon after the violence in Homs reached its peak, when the deputy energy minister resigned and joined the opposition.
但是如果把这一问题仅仅丢给以色列和巴勒斯坦，那么巴勒斯坦在其1967年的边界内独立的目标将会遥不可及。	But if left to Israelis and Palestinians alone, the goal of Palestinian independence within the 1967 borders of Palestine will most likely remain out of reach.
在CAFTA的规则下，该协议一旦获得批准，80%从美国出口的货物将会免税，所有的关税都会在15年内取消。	Under CAFTA, 80% of US exports will be duty-free as soon as the treaty is ratified, and all tariffs will expire in 15 years.
我现在了解到，如果非洲想实现农业转型，非洲国家首先需要打消让农业部门落后的主要壁垒 — — 普遍存在的性别差距。	What I am now learning is that if Africa hopes to spark an agricultural transformation, countries will first need to remove one of the main barriers holding the sector back: a pervasive gender gap.
也许比特币投机客是下注于永远会找到流氓国家联盟允许使用匿名的比特币，甚至有朝鲜这样的国家会利用比特币。	Perhaps Bitcoin speculators are betting that there will always be a consortium of rogue states allowing anonymous Bitcoin usage, or even state actors such as North Korea that will exploit it.
事实上，在2001年后的十年中推动两位数增长的投资拉动型增长模式加剧了结构性弱点，目前已到了必须纠正的地步。	In fact, the investment-led growth model that facilitated double-digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses, which must now be addressed.
若我签署了引渡申请文件，其意义将是突破性的，因为它将首次向世人昭示，如果司法公正在本国不可能实现，涉嫌侵犯人权者可以在世界任何地方面临审判。	Signing the papers would be groundbreaking, as it would signal for the first time that suspected rights abusers might face trial anywhere in the world if justice was not likely at home.
就在1979年伊朗爆发伊斯兰革命之前没多久，一份美国中情局报告还将伊朗王朝比作“汪洋中不沉的海岛 ” 。	Just before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, a CIA report characterized the Iranian monarchy as an “island of stability.”
这样的目标有点像国家计划经济的遗留 — — 并与政策制定者把新重点放在市场的“决定性作用”背道而驰。	Such targets smack of the legacy of a state-directed economy – a legacy that runs counter to policymakers’ new emphasis on the “decisive role” of markets.
我们可以从这宗案件（和其他多宗类似案件）中推断的是他们是高度传统的农村社会半城市化的产物，在这样的社会中，人，特别是女人的角色是严格限制的。	From what we can surmise from this case – and many others like it – they are the semi-urbanized products of a highly conventional rural society where the roles of men, and especially women, are tightly regulated.
这些条款的真实意图是阻挠旨在保护美国本国经济和公民的卫生、环境、安全以及 — — 是的，甚至还有金融监管。	The real intent of these provisions is to impede health, environmental, safety, and, yes, even financial regulations meant to protect America’s own economy and citizens.
伊斯坦布尔—在不断向外扩张的大都市伊斯坦布尔有一个塔克西姆广场（Taksim Square ） ， 塔克西姆广场有一个小公园，它是市中心硕果仅存的几处绿色空间之一。	ISTANBUL – The small park in Taksim Square in the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul is one of the few green spaces left in the city center.
每一项研究都解释了绿色经济的一部份，没有一个能涵盖整体 — — 这不是因为这些研究有缺陷，只不过因为这件事已经完全超出了我们的能力之外。	Each of the studies describes a part of a green economy, but none can capture the whole – not because they are deficient, but because it is simply beyond our capability.
如果日本、美国和其他国家试图拦截或者回击朝鲜发射的导弹，那么，军事紧张局势 — — 甚至是可能的对抗 — — 就非常可能会接踵而来。	If Japan, the US, and others attempt to intercept or counter the missile, military tension – even possible combat – is likely to ensue.
2009—2012年希腊政府每季度支出攀升至135亿欧元左右的高峰，然后在2014—2015年下降至96亿美元左右。	Greek government spending per quarter climbed to a plateau of around €13.5 billion ($14.8 billion) in 2009-2012, before falling to roughly €9.6 billion in 2014-2015.
就在一个月前，南亚发生海啸，有关人员死亡、灾民受难以及各种基础设施遭受严重破坏的报道占据了此次海啸报道的主题。	Reports about the tsunamis that devastated Southeast Asia barely a month ago have understandably been dominated by tales of death, suffering, and the physical destruction of infrastructure.
因此即便欧盟体现了我们为确保欧洲在日渐艰难的时势中保持竞争力的良好愿望，它依然受到“为危机全球化推波助澜”的指责。	So, although the EU represents our best hope of ensuring that Europe is internationally competitive in today’s increasingly difficult environment, it is actually being blamed for globalization.
当然， 人们应当注意到，如果资源丰富的非洲经济改革进展得如同亚洲那样，那么，高涨的基本商品价格时代就将会推迟一个世纪。	Of course, it should be noted that if economic reform in resource-rich Africa had been proceeding at the same pace as in Asia, the era of soaring commodity prices might have been postponed for another century.
事实上，辅助性原则 — — 决策应该在尽可能地方的层面发生 — — 对于能良好运转的灵活的全球治理至关重要。	Indeed, the principle of subsidiarity – whereby decision-making should occur at the most local level possible – is crucial to flexible, functioning global governance.
然而除了勉强承认其关于喜马拉雅冰川的预测是“有悖事实”之外， IPCC 没有承认任何其他的错漏 — — 更遑论为此而道歉了。	Yet, aside from a grudging admission that its predictions about Himalayan glaciers were “poorly substantiated,” the IPCC has yet to acknowledge – much less apologize for – any of the lapses.
而肯尼亚无处不在的移动银行服务M-Pesa显然让贫困妇女能够从小农经济转向非农业经济，从而为最底层民众带来了显著收入增长。	Kenya’s ubiquitous mobile banking service M-Pesa appears to have enabled poor women to move out of subsistence agriculture into non-farm businesses, providing a significant bump up the income ladder at the very bottom.
尽管广泛利润分享计划表现出诸多好处，但只有三分之一的美国私营部门员工参与其中，并且只有大约20%持有本公司股票。	Despite the demonstrated benefits of broad-based profit-sharing programs, only about one-third of US private-sector workers participate in them, and about 20% own stock in their companies.
如果我们认识到创新来自理解地方情况和优化私人部门的巨量资源，我们就能确保未来更好的健康情况 — — 和更快的经济增长。	If we recognize that innovation stems from understanding local conditions and optimizing the vast resources of the private sector, we can ensure better health – and more rapid economic growth – far into the future.
2016年，发达国家应该同意接受每年总数接近100万的难民，方式可以是安置，也可以是提供人道、学生、劳工和其他签证。	In 2016, developed countries should agree to accept a combined total approaching a million refugees annually, either through resettlement or by issuing humanitarian, student, labor, and other visas.
由拉美人、东欧犹太人、意大利人、亚洲人、爱尔兰人和现在依然对牛津剑桥的双桨滑过查尔斯河河水魂牵梦绕的英裔美国人共同组成了伟大的美国民众。	In the United States, it is that great people composed of Latinos, Eastern European Jews, Italians, Asians, Irish, and, yes, Anglos still dreaming of Oxford-Cambridge sculls now cleaving the waters of the Charles River.
2010年以来房地产投资减少带来的负面影响比预期深远。 事实的确如此，几乎所有在8月下跌超过10%的各类进口项目都与房地产投资有关。	The negative impact of the fall in real-estate investment since 2010 has been deeper and longer than expected; indeed, almost all categories of imports that fell by 10% or more in August were related to real-estate investment.
与此同时，他们的行为 — — 以及其他银行家的类似行为 — — 却直接导致了住宅价格的上涨以及随后的毁灭性崩溃。	At the same time, their actions – and similar actions by other bankers – are directly responsible for both the run-up in housing prices and the damaging collapse that followed.
和这种个人化相关的大脑区域是从我们的贸易伙伴还是小型氏族团体成员的时候开始进化的。 在那样的情况下，违反道德的行为会被即时发现并加以纠正。	This personalization draws upon regions of the brain that evolved when our trading partners were members of small kin-based groups where moral violations were immediately identified and remedied.
这就解释了美国的房地产，纽约、伦敦和法兰克福的股票，世界各地的长期债券与人们认可的传统基本价值之间形成的巨大落差。	This explains the large gaps between current prices for real estate in the US, equities in New York, London, and Frankfurt, and long-term bonds everywhere and what one would conventionally think their fundamental values should be.
苏格兰微生物学家亚历山大·弗莱明（Alexander Fleming）发现能够杀死细菌的菌类后不久就认识到，过度使用抗生素会引起耐药性。	Not long after the Scottish microbiologist Alexander Fleming discovered a fungus that could kill bacteria, he recognized that overuse of antibiotics would encourage resistance.
如今，中国正意欲把核心利益一词用于与日本的钓鱼岛之争，甚至不顾危险地将它用于对整个南海的主张：事实上，一些军官已经在这么用了。	Now China is attempting to apply the same term to the Senkaku Islands in its dispute with Japan, and is perilously close to making the same claim for the entire South China Sea; indeed, some Chinese military officers already have.
纽约 — — 1945年广岛和长崎被毁标志着一个时代的结束和另一个时代的开始。 二战结束后冷战开始，世界小心翼翼地维护着摇摇欲坠的和平。	NEW YORK – The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 marked an end and a beginning. The close of the Second World War ushered in a Cold War, with a precarious peace based on the threat of mutually assured destruction.
正如萨默斯所警告的，坚持这样做只能在不可避免的失败前造成“不必要的痛苦 ” ， 让希腊（其实远不止希腊）崩溃。	Staying the course, as Summers warns, will lead only to “needless suffering” before that course inevitably collapses, bringing Greece – and much else –­ crashing down.
中国正处于结构转型中，必须警惕避免经济增长对既存增长源泉的削弱，以免掉入结构性陷阱造成结构转型成本过高，抵消转型的好处。	China is in the midst of that process, and it must be careful not to undermine existing sources of growth lest it fall into a structural trap where the cost of transition itself derails new gains.
简而言之，西方的对乌战略应该是在大选之前刺激该国经济，然后再与大选后建立的政府谈判建立一个改革方案。	In short, the Western strategy for Ukraine should be to stimulate the Ukrainian economy until the May election and then negotiate a package of reforms with the government that emerges.
我们面临的挑战是向年轻人证明我们很容易被恐怖分子的诉求所影响 — — 恐怖分子会告诉我们，有更好的办法让你的声音被听到，你可以通过更有意义的方式参与到世界中去。	The challenge is to show young people who are vulnerable to appeals from terrorists that there is a better path to having their voice heard, a more meaningful way to engage with the world.
随着21世纪的深入，大部分发达国家都将经历人口短缺，但美国是其中少数可能避免人口下降、维持其世界人口比例的国家之一。	Whereas most developed countries will experience a shortage of people as the century progresses, America is one of the few that may avoid demographic decline and maintain its share of world population.
因此即便企业更容易得到钱和贷款，许多公司依然不愿意大规模招人，因此害怕在未来经济下滑时要背上一张巨额工资单。	Hence, even if businesses get easier access to money and loans, many firms will still decline to hire on a large scale, fearing that they would be saddled with a large payroll in a future downturn.
伊朗觊觎核武器能力并且指使其什叶派代理人好战份子，不仅威胁以色列以及该地区，而且还在寻求僭取温和的逊尼派阿拉伯政权传统的巴勒斯坦人保护人的角色。	Iran not only threatens Israel (and the region) with its desire for a nuclear capability and its Shi’a proxy militants; it is also seeking to usurp the traditional role of moderate Sunni Arab regimes as the Palestinians’ defenders.
跟医学一样，经济学也被划分成许多不同的门类 — — 宏观经济学家一般不会关注金融经济学家或地产经济学家究竟在干什么，反之亦然。	Like medicine, economics has become highly compartmentalized – macroeconomists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real-estate economists study, and vice versa.
面对如此的现实，住在赫尔辛基的公务员Jiri Räsänen刚开始也同样感到沮丧，但随后他和他的朋友们想到了一个好主意：为什么不能在保留汽车的前提下，而只是更换发动机呢？	That fact at first depressed Jiri Räsänen, a civil servant in Helsinki – but then it gave him and his friends a good idea. Why not keep the cars but replace their engines?
美国石油生产商的补贴常常打着国家安全旗号；事实上 ， “ 先耗尽美国”的政策从长期看降低了能源自给率。	Subsidies to US oil producers have often been sold on national-security grounds; in fact, a policy to “drain America first” reduces self-sufficiency in the longer run.
美国对日本的出口几乎100％都是以美元计价的，意味着这些出口就像弗里德曼的版本一样是对美元有粘性的。	Almost 100% of US exports to Japan are priced in dollars, meaning that they, as in Friedman’s version, are sticky in dollars.
从根本上来说，它必须采用一个以规则为基础的机制来处理与两个邻国的关系，而也是中国政府对此患得患失的原因。	In essence, it would have to accept a rules-based system for its relations with its two neighbors, something of which China’s government has been wary.
它们的邻国中不乏深陷内部冲突或艰难转型者，国内不满情绪也在不断升级。 海湾国家急切地想平息革命浪潮。	With their neighbors embroiled in internal conflict or in the midst of difficult transitions, and with discontent rising at home, the Gulf states are eager to stem the tide of revolution.
而国会预算办公室则预计美国的财政赤字将在未来十年平均维持在GDP的5%左右，并因此导致政府债务占GDP的比例从2009年度的低于60%上升到90 % 。	The Congressional Budget Office projects that the country’s fiscal deficit will average 5% of GDP for the rest of the decade, driving government debt to 90% of GDP, from less than 60% of GDP in 2009.
但那些新一代马尔萨斯主义者反对将这些巨大的利益扩展到世界更多地方，因为他们认为全球变暖状况是如此恶劣以致必须去阻止增长。	The latter-day Malthusians are opposed to extending these tremendous benefits to more of the world because they believe that global warming will be so bad that it justifies stopping growth.
波兰、匈牙利和土耳其政府越来越极权，和巴尔干国家、中国和俄罗斯的领导人一样，它们越来越热衷于控制公共话题。	The governments of Poland, Hungary, and Turkey have become increasingly authoritarian and – like leaders in the Balkans, China, and Russia – increasingly eager to control public discourse.
食品价格通胀达到了两位数，人们对有多大比例的印度人生活在贫困线以下甚至贫困县应该划在什么水平争论不休。	Double-digit food-price inflation has been accompanied by debate about the share of Indians living below the poverty line, and, indeed, where the poverty line should be drawn.
20世纪90年代，发展中国家增长开始总体快于发达国家（用人均标准衡量 ） ， 这让很多人乐观地认为这两类国家的产出和收入将会趋于一致。	In the 1990s, developing economies, taken as a whole, began to grow faster than their advanced counterparts (in per capita terms), inspiring optimism that the two groups’ output and income would converge.
埃及前总统萨拉特对耶路撒冷的访问，以及以埃两国随后在美国戴维营达成的突破性成果，都是在双方前期私下取得谅解之后发生的。	The visit to Jerusalem of Egypt's then-President Anwar el-Sadat, and the ensuing Egypt-Israel breakthrough at Camp David, took place only after successful behind-the-scenes understandings.
而这个引发众多争议的提议 — — 其中最著名的倡议者是约翰•凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes ） — —要求为初级商品建立一个“缓冲库存 ” ， 当价格下跌时吸纳产品，反之则增加供应量。	This argument inspired proposals – most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 – to create “buffer stocks” for the main commodities, which would take supply off the market when prices fell, and add to supply when prices rose.
与此同时，2001年，利用美国专利商标局反应慢的弱点，Proctor对科罗拉多州16家小型种子公司提出侵犯专利权的诉讼。	Meanwhile, in 2001, taking advantage of the USPTO’s slow response, Proctor sued 16 small seed companies in Colorado for patent-infringement.
欧洲一体化就是多边全球主义实验的核心；随着法国与德国和解，欧洲这个自古以来冲突不断的地带成为了模范合作者的土地。	European integration was at the core of this experiment in multilateral globalism; with Franco-German reconciliation, Europe, a chronic conflict zone, became a region of exemplary cooperators.
事实上，自2008年初以来，平均年化真实消费支出增长只有1.3 % — —为有记录以来消费增长最萎靡的阶段。	In fact, since early 2008, annualized growth in real consumer expenditure has averaged a mere 1.3% – the most anemic period of consumption growth on record.
北京吸引了中国最顶尖的政治评论家，他们不喜欢讨论那些单调的宗教议题，而耶路撒冷的社会评论家则致力于解读那些将人们团结在一起的宗教。	Beijing attracts China’s leading political critics, while Jerusalem’s social critics argue for an interpretation of religion that holds people, rather than inanimate objects, sacred.
但自 20 世纪 90 年代起，后退速度有所回落，因为一些知名大冰川，如根戈德里冰川和锡亚琴冰川的后退 ， “ 在 2007~2009 年期间实际上已经处于停滞状态 。 ”	But the retreat slowed after the mid-1990’s until, for some of the biggest and best-known glaciers, such as Gangotri and Siachen, it had “practically come to a standstill during the period 2007-2009.”
根据新气候经济（New Climate Economy）计划的数据，到2030年全球基础设施投资将达到89万亿美元 — — 而要让这些投资变得低碳而高恢复力，必须在增加4.1万亿美元投资。	According to the New Climate Economy initiative, $89 trillion will be spent on global infrastructure investment by 2030 – with an additional $4.1 trillion needed to make it low-carbon and resilient.
欧洲是一个地理和历史的独特结合体，但是欧洲的边界 — — 以及它未来扩大的前景 — — 是由成员国的容纳能力和适应能力所决定的。	Europe is a peculiar combination of geography and history, but the boundaries of the EU – and thus the prospects for its further enlargement – are determined by its absorptive capacity and the adaptive abilities of candidate countries.
比方说我们可以通过重点研究各器官特性来加深对器官和组织包块或对肝脏、胰腺等器官脂肪浸润的理解，而避免把注意力放在全身的总体得分上。	We can understand more about organ and tissue masses, for example, or fatty infiltrations in individual organs like the liver and pancreas, by focusing on the nature of each body component, rather than by relying on an overall body score.
发自墨尔本 — — 许多年前，当我和太太开车载着三个年幼的女儿出行时，其中一个突然问了一句 ： “ 爸爸妈妈你们是希望我们聪明一点呢，还是快乐一点呢 ？ ”	MELBOURNE – Many years ago, my wife and I were driving somewhere with our three young daughters in the back, when one of them suddenly asked: “Would you rather that we were clever or that we were happy?”
2013年，增税、隔离程序要求的政府支出削减、政府临时关门以及有约束力的赤字上限可能要求政府进一步削减支出对经济产生了拖累。	The economy in 2013 was held back by tax increases, government spending cuts mandated by the sequester process, the temporary government shutdown, and the possibility that a binding debt ceiling would require further cuts in government outlays.
他希望德国能够脱离纳粹主义，纳粹主义能被摧毁的同时而德国不被摧毁，从而让这个伟大国家作为抵御苏联的桥头堡。	He hoped that Germany could be separated from Nazism, that Nazism could be destroyed without destroying Germany, thus preserving that great nation as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.
他甚至宣称为自己并未强制执行“红线 ” — —在2012年就叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德（Bashar al-Assad）的使用化学武器而划定的界限 — — 而感到自豪，因为无论国际法还是美国国会都不会批准实施干预。	He even claimed to be proud of not enforcing the “red line” he had drawn in 2012 regarding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, as neither international law nor the US Congress would have sanctioned intervention.
由于起领导作用的国家不能或者不愿 — — 究竟属于哪种情况已经很难搞清 — — 继续管理日益增加的资金流，导致布雷顿森林体系于20世纪70年代陷入崩溃。	The Bretton Woods regime collapsed in the 1970’s as a result of the inability or unwillingness – it is not entirely clear which – of leading governments to manage the growing tide of capital flows.
他们的关注点应该被聆听和讨论；有时禁止最好辅之以国民教育方面的新措施，比如强调移民并没有导致希腊的萧条。	Their concerns should be heard and debated; and sometimes banning is best combined with renewed efforts at civic education, emphasizing, for example, that immigrants did not cause Greece’s woes.
2003—2004年，日本财务省购买了大量美元，从而在日本银行不愿采取公开市场操作的情况下放松了货币条件。	From 2003 to 2004, the Japanese treasury purchased a large amount of dollars, thereby easing monetary conditions at a time when the BOJ was reluctant to pursue open market operations.
另一大复杂性叙利亚的少数派阿拉维派统治着占多数的逊尼派，这使得叙利亚成为什叶派伊朗在逊尼派阿拉伯世界中的代理。	Another is Alawite-minority rule in a Sunni-majority country, which makes Syria a proxy for Shia Iran in the Sunni Arab world.
此外欧洲还有很深的研究人才储备 — — 全球最顶尖的十家计算机科学研究所中有五家位于欧盟 — — 欧洲的创业繁荣看上去可以维持。	Add to that deep research talent – five of the top ten global computer science faculties are within the EU – and Europe’s start-up boom looks sustainable.
气候变化不是我们国家为了保持自然之美而必须克服的最令人生畏的挑战 — — 哥斯达黎加是每平方米生物多样性最好的国家之一。	Climate change is not the first daunting challenge our country – among the world’s most biodiverse countries per square meter – has had to overcome to preserve its natural beauty.
同时，在美国的财政系统中，国税要占总税收的三分之二，这意味着收入暂时下降的州可以自动且持续地获得净财政转移支持。	The recent collapse of those bubbles caused sharp downturns in economic activity and substantial increases in unemployment in both countries.
这部分是因为欧洲实行高税收，任何人对此都无能为力：如果人们认为自己拿回家的报酬太低，而边际税率太高，没有人能强迫他们去工作。	This is partly due to higher taxes in Europe, and this cannot be undone: nobody can force someone to work if they consider their take-home pay too low because of a high marginal tax rate.
前总统克林顿曾说他为未能充分应对1994年卢旺达爆发的种族灭绝危机而感到遗憾，尽管应该遗憾的人还有很多。	Former President Bill Clinton has said that he regrets his failure to respond adequately to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, although he was not alone.
与此同时，法国和荷兰民众的声音也不应该被忽视，尤其是因为在它们中随便哪一个国家就同一个文本进行二次全民公决都是不可想象的事情。	At the same time, French and Dutch citizens’ voices cannot be ignored – all the more so because it is unimaginable that an identical text could be submitted to a second referendum in either country.
罗姆尼最近承认了这一点，承认“财政断崖 ” — —布什时代的税收减免将于今年年底前结束，再加上已经预定实施的大规模开支削减计划 — — 将联合起来把经济推入衰退。	Romney conceded this point recently, acknowledging that the “fiscal cliff” – the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts at the end of this year, combined with large spending cuts already scheduled to take effect – would push the economy back into recession.
在这一不确定性面前，企业部门在风险最高、资本最密集的投资已经完成之前，或在出现清晰的系统性信号之前是不会进入市场的。	In the face of such uncertainty, the business sector will not enter the market until the riskiest and most capital-intensive investments have been made, or until coherent and systematic political signals have been communicated.
对日本来说，这将是沉重一击，而如果特朗普兑现竞选承诺，要求日本和韩国等盟国增加自身防御的“保护费”日本的损失还会更大。	That will be a big loss for Japan, and the country will lose out even more if Trump follows through on his campaign promise to make allies such as Japan and South Korea pay more for their own defense.
这些新的威胁，正如在‘第三帝国’统治下那样对人类生命表现出同样的蔑视并对建立一种对全世界的独裁表现出同样的渴望 。 ”	These new threats, just as under the Third Reich, show the same contempt for human life and the same aspiration to establish an exclusive dictate over the world.”
但由于预期会因应央行行为做出调整，所以自由裁量的货币政策其实是无效的 — — 只会产生较高的通胀率却缺乏产出或就业增长。	But, because expectations adjust to central bank behavior, discretionary monetary policy is futile: it yields higher inflation but no output or employment increases.
由于许多经济部门缺乏竞争力且教育体系不完善，沙特人口 — — 其中70%不到35岁 — — 将在今后几年经历爆发式失业潮。	Given many economic sectors’ lack of competitiveness and the inadequacy of the educational system, the Saudi population – 70% of which is under 35 years old – will experience skyrocketing unemployment in the coming years.
最近几年，扩大疫苗项目进展迅速，这一信息代表了全球社会的独特机会，特别是在我们即将彻底消灭小儿麻痹症时。	Given the progress made in expanding vaccination programs in recent years, this revelation represents a unique opportunity for the global community, particularly as we begin to close the lid on polio.
所有这些都表明，要么是大选后的跛脚鸭国会会议上，要么在新国会产生后的最初几个月，美国政客可能会消除财政悬崖。	All of this suggests that, whether in the lame-duck congressional session following the elections or in the first few months of the new Congress, US politicians will likely dismantle the fiscal cliff.
为支持经济增长和发展，我们需要发掘所有劳动者的潜力，不仅授予女性赚钱的机会，而且要让她们担负起领导职责。	To support economic growth and development, we need to tap the potential of all workers, giving women opportunities not just to earn, but also to lead.
出席就职典礼的人数 — — 远远少于特朗普愿意相信的规模 — — 可以从现成的证据（包括国家广场的照片和地铁乘客人数等）很容易地推断。	The number of people who attended the inauguration – far less than Trump wanted to believe – could easily be inferred from the available evidence (including photographs of the National Mall and the number of subway riders).
流言通过社交媒体传播，特别是WhatsApp，这导致无辜的人因为被控宰牛、绑架儿童或更恶劣的行为而被暴民处以私刑。	Rumors forwarded via social media, especially on WhatsApp, have led to mob lynchings of innocent people falsely accused of being cow slaughterers, child kidnappers, or worse.
这是因为，最初的平静时期常常以腐败堕落滋生以及革命目标的倒退为标志，导致理想主义者感到革命失去了方向。	This is because the initial quiet period is often marked by corruption and a retreat from revolutionary goals, leading idealists to feel that the revolution is losing its way.
杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）和沃尔特·白芝浩（Walter Bagehot）就是反对派阵营中的两大巨头。	Two notable holdouts are Jamie Dimon and Walter Bagehot.
在经过多年徒劳地试图和平解决争端，以及十几次根据谈判者的部署而推出的官方以及不公开渠道的和平计划后，能够创造性地达成协议的空间已经非常小了。	After years of frustrated attempts to reach a settlement, and with dozens of official and back-channel peace plans at the negotiators’ disposal, there remains little room for creativity in producing an agreement.
更为引人注目的模式是美国人对实际流动性较低的部分地区 — — 包括乔治亚，阿拉巴马，弗吉尼亚，北卡罗来纳和南卡罗来纳等东南部各州 — — 的社会流动性过于乐观。	An even more striking pattern is that Americans are overly optimistic about social mobility in parts of the country where actual mobility is low – including the southeastern states of Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
说到底，AI的未来（future of AI ） — —我们的AI未来（AI future ） — —是光明的。	Ultimately, the future of AI – our AI future – is bright.
加尔布雷斯观察到，占款私用（embezzlement）有一种性质，即“罪行犯下和发现之间会有几周、几个月或几年的时滞。	Embezzlement, Galbraith observed, has the property that “weeks, months, or years elapse between the commission of the crime and its discovery.
相反，俄罗斯是更典型的民族安全国家（National Security State ） ， 撩拨西方的焦虑以巩固其对乌克兰的控制，以官方民族主义镇压国内反对者。	Russia, by contrast, is a more classic National Security State, now playing Western anxieties like a fiddle to consolidate its tightening grip on Ukraine and suppress domestic opposition with a tide of official nationalism.
在这样的背景下，很难解释为何欧洲央行要继续坚持非常规货币政策措施 — — 比如负利率和不断地购买债券。	Against this background, it is difficult to explain why the ECB continues to insist that unconventional monetary-policy measures – such as negative rates and continued bond purchases – are needed.
我们只不过尚未具备足够的深刻洞察力去理解在一场遥远的变革 — — 不管是一场金融危机还是爆发式增长 — — 中所有的因素将如何互动。	We simply do not yet have sufficiently precise insights into how all of its elements interact during times of far-reaching change, whether it be a financial crisis or a growth spurt.
卡尔加里—当哈维·库欣（Harvey Cushing）和威廉·博威（William Bovie）于1926年引入电灼（用高频电流封闭血管或制造切口 ） ， 他们的创新改变了神经外科学。	CALGARY – When Harvey Cushing and William Bovie introduced electrocautery (which uses a high-frequency current to seal blood vessels or make incisions) in 1926, their innovation transformed neurosurgery.
1989年，在爱沙尼亚之旅中（当时爱沙尼亚仍是苏联的一部分 ） ， 我要的翻译 — — 一位兼职牙医带我去她的牙科诊所。	In 1989, during a trip to Estonia – then still a part of the Soviet Union – I asked my interpreter, a moonlighting dentist, to take me to her dental clinic.
我们不知道下一场危机何时发生，在哪里发生，但我们能知道它会发生 — — 并且我们必须在它发生时做出更好的准备。	We do not know when and where the next crisis will erupt, but we do know that it will – and that we must be better prepared when it does.
因此 ， 《 利维坦》由俄罗斯文化部拨出部分资金 — — 并且表示俄罗斯当局对赢得奥斯卡奖不感兴趣 — — 显得颇为讽刺。	So it is ironic that Leviathan was partly financed by Russia's culture ministry – and telling that the Russian authorities had no interest in its winning at the Oscars.
比如，如果实际发生在2012年初的伦敦鲸交易发生在2008年金融系统孱弱不堪时，JPM就会被网开一面。	The London Whale trades, for example, were from early 2012; had they occurred in 2008, when the financial system was fragile, JPM, it is said, would have gotten a legal pass.
我会尽快派遣一支欧洲开放社会计划需求评估团队到希腊与当局（及已经在帮助需要者的民众和组织）联系，以便制定一项能争取公众支持的计划。	As soon as possible, I will dispatch an OSIFE needs-assessment team to Greece to contact the authorities – and the people and organizations already helping the needy – to work out a plan for which we can generate public support.
毕竟，这项政策不是由国土安全部门制定的，而是由特朗普的首席战略顾问、自命为文化斗士的史蒂芬·班农（Stephen Bannon）制定的。	After all, the policy was designed not by the domestic security establishment, but by Trump’s chief strategist, the avowed culture warrior Stephen Bannon.
诺贝尔奖获得者、农学家布劳格（Norman Borlaug）用公共资金开发的新的“绿色革命”种子可以被世界各地的使用者免费获得。	The new “Green Revolution” seeds that the Nobel laureate agronomist Norman Borlaug developed with public money were freely available to all users anywhere.
我们的方法II的理性总是能够指向每个理性的个人都会同意的最优选择的��蒙观点，和多数 合理 选择这一广泛接受的现代观点相冲突。	The Enlightenment idea that our System-II rationality can always point to an optimal choice about which every reasonable individual would agree clashes with the widely accepted modern idea that there is a plurality of reasonable choices.
事实上，就在上周，福克斯新闻主播比尔·奥莱利尽管拥有美国最受欢迎的有线电视真人秀，但却依然失去了工作。 因为广告商面对团结一致的民众压力而迅速抛弃了他。	Indeed, just last week, the Fox News host Bill O’Reilly lost his job, despite having America’s most popular cable news show, when advertisers, facing concerted grassroots pressure, quickly deserted him.
最有效的征税方法之一是美国工资税，该税种的边际税率接近于平均税率（因为不存在减税，税率结构的累进性也较低 ） 。	One of the most efficient tax-raising methods is the US payroll tax, for which the marginal tax rate is close to the average rate (because deductions are absent and there is little graduation in the rate structure).
这就要求人们更加深入地理解技术驱动的结构变化，科技巨头要与政府同步理解并对其日益提升的系统重要性做出调整。	This demands deeper comprehension of technology-driven structural changes, with Big Tech recognizing and adjusting to its growing systemic importance in step with government.
自Facebook 和Twitter被曝光在2016年美国总统竞选期间起着传播假消息和炮制不信任和种族对立的关键作用以来，越来越多的人要求加强监管。	Since the revelations that Facebook and Twitter played a key role in disseminating false information and sowing mistrust and racial tension in the 2016 US election, a growing chorus has called for stricter regulations.
阿萨德政权将垂死挣扎转化为种族和宗派冲突的行径将对整个地区造成严重的破坏，而首当其冲受到影响的就是巴嫩和伊拉克等邻国。	The regime’s effort to turn its struggle for survival into an ethnic and sectarian conflict could wreak havoc across the region, starting with neighbors like Lebanon and Iraq.
中国政府不愿人民币快速升值可能是因为其厌恶不可预知的大幅波动，特别是在其准备将人民币推向国际储备货币地位的时候。	The Chinese government’s reluctance to allow faster exchange-rate appreciation may reflect its aversion to large, unforeseeable fluctuations, particularly given its determination to make the renminbi an international reserve currency.
全球化的受益者通常用促进新活动、有利于实体经济而不是金融的政策，以及强调高生产率就业的连续改革的战略来对全球化进行补充。	The beneficiaries of globalization are typically those countries that complemented it with a strategy to promote new activities, policies that favored the real economy over finance, and sequential reforms that emphasized high-productivity employment.
尽管传统上贸易被认为是决定汇率的主要因素，汇率涨跌通常被认为可以纠正一国的对外贸易失衡，但当今资本跨境流动规模已经非常庞大，它们对汇率的冲击比以前大很多 。	While trade is supposed to be the primary driver of exchange rates, which should rise or fall to correct countries’ external imbalances, capital flows have grown to the point that their role in guiding exchange rates is now much larger.
比方说非洲和印度乡下都有不少自行车维修点、报摊和小商店，可以对店主进行培训，让他们学会安装并维护这些系统。	For example, bicycle mechanics, who are plentiful in Africa and rural India, or small shop and kiosk owners could be trained to install and maintain these systems.
“伊拉克名单”在2010年3月的议会选举中赢得的席位最多，但其领导人，前总理伊亚德·阿拉维将不会再任旧职。	Iraqiya won the largest share of seats in the March 2010 parliamentary elections, yet its leader, former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, will not return to his old job.
这表明，尽管释放囚犯可以促成短期协议，但并没有带来旨在形成基于信任的、能带来持续和平的协议的真正努力。	This suggests that, while the prisoner release may lead to a short-term agreement, it is not backed by a genuine effort to develop the kind of trust-based arrangements that are needed for lasting peace.
如果发动袭击的主要理由是人道主义（结束对叙利亚平民的毫无意义的屠杀 ） ， 美国军事干预将弊大于利。	If the main justification for an attack is humanitarian – to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians – US military intervention would do more harm than good.
除了叙利亚，两大问题将决定新中东的未来：穆斯林兄弟会治下的埃及的道路以及伊朗核计划和地区角色图谋冲突的结果。	Along with Syria, two issues will determine this new Middle East’s future: Egypt’s path under the Muslim Brotherhood, and the outcome of confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program and regional role.
现在，我们可以发现一些对人类观察者来说不那么容易发现的新模式 — — 这已经为我们带来降低能源消费和二氧化碳排放的方法。	We can now find new patterns that are not readily evident to the human observer – and this already suggests ways to lower energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
日本要求其航空公司无视中国有关航班预先通知的要求，中国要求一切航班均需预先通知，即使这些航班只是途径新识别区，而不是飞往中国领空。	Japan has asked its airlines to ignore China’s demand for advance notification of flights, even if they are merely transiting the new zone and not heading toward Chinese territorial airspace.
这一次，美国十分愿意通过充分的合作来促进海地的经济发展：再发生一连串的事故只能引起混乱，包括大量新的难民流入美国。	This time, the US has a strong interest in cooperating fully to promote economic progress: another round of failure would only provoke chaos, including massive numbers of new refugees to the US.
但不妨换一个角度看待危机和我们的金融机构：金融系统距离悬崖边缘从未如此之远，即使是在2008年之前。 这是因为税收制度鼓励金融企业过度负债。	But consider another way of viewing the crisis and our financial institutions: the financial system was never all that far from the cliff’s edge, even before 2008, because the tax system encouraged financial firms to overload themselves with debt.
但满足民众安全需求所需的多数政策都超出了国家政府的能力范畴，特别是当这些政府自己还在想办法适应的时候。	But most of the policy responses needed to meet people’s demand for greater security are beyond the scope and reach of national governments, especially when these governments are trying to cope on their own.
中国领导人将中国对印度的不对称贸易关系 — — 出口比进口高五倍多 — — 视为破坏其对手的制造业基础，同时还能斩获可观的利润的战略武器。	Chinese leaders value the lopsided trade relationship with India – exports are more than five times higher than imports – as a strategic weapon to undercut its rival’s manufacturing base while reaping handsome profits.
丹佛 — — 从4月27日韩国总统文在寅和朝鲜总统金正恩举行最高首脑会晤以来，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普就一直不遗余力地想要证明自己才是朝韩外交背后的策划者，这一点丝毫也不出人意料。	DENVER – Since the April 27 summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump has sought, unsurprisingly, to portray himself as the mastermind behind inter-Korean diplomacy.
类似地，1987年至1993年巴勒斯坦第一次抵抗运动（Intifada）后，以色列国防界领导了和平努力。	Similarly, in the aftermath of the first Intifada, the Palestinian uprising that lasted from 1987 to 1993, the defense establishment led the effort for peace.
德国现在得求神拜佛，希望人们 — — 德国选民和中国基金管理者 — — 现在把这些承诺当真，又在十年后把它们忘掉。	The best hope for Germany is that people – both German voters and Chinese fund managers – will take such promises seriously now, but forget about them in ten years.
即使是他对缅甸的历史性访问 — — 他是第一个访问该国的美国总统 — — 对贸易的关注也将不亚于促使这个具有战略地理重要性的资源丰富国家摆脱中国的影响。	Even his historic visit to Myanmar – the first ever by a US president – is as much about trade as it is about weaning a strategically located, resource-rich country from Chinese influence.
阿富汗战争造成美军伤亡人数比前几场战争都要少，但人力成本仍然非常巨大 — — 特别是在考虑到阿富汗方面的伤亡后。	While the war in Afghanistan may have resulted in fewer American deaths and injuries than previous US wars, the human cost remains substantial – especially after factoring in Afghan deaths and injuries.
至于中国的银行，主要问题似乎是地方政府债务膨胀带来的，根据政府数据，截止2010年底的地方政府债务总值达1.7万亿美元（约占GDP30%的份额 ） 。	As for Chinese banks, the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local-government debt, which, according to the government, totaled $1.7 trillion (roughly 30% of GDP) at the end of 2010.
新的奥巴马政府提出了开支计划，其中赤字超过一万亿美元，这会创下新的纪录。 而这还是在刚离任的布什政府已经创下了有史以来的最高赤字之后。	The new Obama administration is proposing spending plans that would create a record US deficit of more than one trillion dollars – and this coming on top of the outgoing Bush administration’s record deficit.
这样对移民进行攻击或许能够带来一些即时的政治利益，但是最终结果必定会使社会分裂，而社会的凝聚力已经受到了经济危机严重影响。	Such attacks on immigration might offer some instant political gratification, but their net result is to cleave societies whose cohesion is already seriously challenged by the economic crisis.
去年乌克兰的经常帐户赤字约为GDP的8.3 % ， 导致其外汇储备不断减少，仅能维持两个月的进口所需。	Its current-account deficit last year was an estimated 8.3% of GDP, and its foreign-currency reserves are quickly being depleted, covering just over two months of imports.
诺贝尔经济学奖获得者阿玛蒂亚·森强调：大多数饥荒发生时粮食都并非真的紧缺，而是未能把粮食运到需要的人们手中，这在很大程度上是因为他们缺乏购买力。	The Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen has emphasized that most famines are associated not with a shortage of food, but the failure to get food to the people who need it, largely because they lack purchasing power.
过度储蓄又没有面临增加支出的市场压力的债权经济体，以及过度支出并面临市场压力、被迫增加储蓄的债务经济体，它们之间的不对称调整也放大了需求短缺。	So has the asymmetric adjustment between over-saving creditor economies that face no market pressure to spend more, and over-spending debtor economies that do face market pressure and have been forced to save more.
这种极端主义也正在缓慢但逐步地孕育着自己的反对力量，正如我们看到反伊斯兰政党在欧洲大选中逐渐得势，而欧洲领导人关于文化多元化的宣言都沦为废纸。	This extremism is, slowly but surely, producing its own reaction, as we see from Islamaphobic parties’ electoral gains in Europe, and statements by European leaders that multiculturalism has failed.
美国银行手上还有第三张合约（假设对手是贝尔斯登 ） ， 这张合约通过清算所进行，价值1亿美元，但亏损方是贝尔斯登。	BofA also has a contract with, say, Bear Stearns through the clearinghouse for $100 million, with Bear Stearns on the losing end.
他似乎更不会因为将其政府带入一场国际会议而与以色列交恶，就像他的父亲在1991年时与沙米尔总理之间那样。	Nor does he seem eager to open a rift with Israel by dragging its government to an international conference, the way his father did with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1991.
这时，约翰·斯诺（John Snow）挺身而出。 他是一位有开创精神的医生，直觉地认为霍乱不是如同传统智慧认为的那样通过空气传播，而是通过水传播。	Enter John Snow, a pioneering physician who had intuited that cholera was spread not through the air, as conventional wisdom held, but through water.
但随后它们“创建了国家，指定了统治者，划定了边境 ， （ 并引入了）国家制度 ” ， 但这并没有奏效。	But then they “created countries, nominated rulers, delineated frontiers, [and introduced] a state system” that would not work.
尽管它的资产翻了倍，达到3万多亿欧元（折合约4万亿美元 ） ， 欧洲已经在四年中第二次回落到衰退状态。	Despite a doubling of its balance sheet, to a little more than €3 trillion ($4 trillion), Europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years.
相反，基地组织的领导人仍固执地要在整个穆斯林世界建立极端伊斯兰统治，并不惜向一大批被认为是阻碍这一目标的国家宣战。	Al-Qaeda leaders, by contrast, remain wedded to the goal of establishing radical Islamist regimes throughout the Muslim world and waging war against a long list of governments that they see as hostile to this objective.
提高公众意识、改善卫生条件、改进监管方式等其余四诫也取得了某些进展，并大幅降低了农业抗生素的使用 — — 但这还远远不够。	There has been some progress on the remaining four Commandments – greater public awareness, improved sanitation, improved surveillance, and dramatically reduced usage of antibiotics in agriculture – but not enough.
但就目前而言，有关英国脱欧的政策 — — 无论是在英吉利海峡的哪一边 — — 都是市场友好型解决方案的绊脚石。	But, for now, the politics of Brexit – on both sides of the English Channel – are standing in the way of a market-friendly solution.
最后，法国前总统尼古拉·萨科齐（Nicolas Sarkozy）将得势，因为当今的欧元区是由一个由成员国政府首脑（极其财政部长）组成的事实上的经济政府所领导。	In the end, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has prevailed, because the eurozone today is led by a de facto economic government that comprises member countries’ heads of state and government (and their finance ministers).
看来，欧盟委员会酝酿开征金融交易税，背后就是这个想法。 欧洲的经济金融沉疴每况愈下，那便是它新开的药方。	That seems to be the thinking behind the European Commission’s proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) – the Commission’s latest response to Europe’s festering growth and financing problems.
因此，来自全世界的公共知识分子小组组成了国际公司税改革独立委员会（ICRICT ） ， 由我担任主席。	That is why a group of public intellectuals from around the world has created the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), which I chair.
我们目前这场革命始于20世纪60年代的硅谷，而且与摩尔定律密切相关：电脑芯片上的晶体管数量每两三年就会翻一番。	Our current revolution, which began in Silicon Valley in the 1960s, is bound up with Moore’s Law: the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles every couple of years.
几十年来，对于每项价值超过2亿美元的协议，卡扎菲都���自审阅，而且他往往会选择那些外国公司会接收合同的协议。	For decades, Qaddafi personally reviewed every agreement worth more than $200 million and often chose which foreign firms would receive contracts.
结果，与西欧的趋同之路有所放缓，许多国家将远远落后 — — 这一结果与2005年左右时所构想的愿景截然不同，当时，在一代人的时间里实现趋同看起来大有希望。	As a result, convergence with Western Europe could slow, with many countries lagging far behind – a far different outcome from that envisioned during the boom of the mid-2000s, when convergence within a generation seemed almost like a birthright.
就共和党人而言，他们分为传统的自由市场、自由贸易保守派和特朗普“经济民族主义者 ” ， 这些人希望限制移民和贸易，用以代替美国贸易伙伴所做出的让步。	For their part, the Republicans are divided between traditional free-market, free-trade conservatives and Trumpian “economic nationalists” who want to restrict immigration and trade in lieu of concessions by America’s trading partners.
甚至连土地和海洋的化学成分也发生着变化。 海水的酸性日益增强—进而威胁着珊瑚礁—就是二氧化碳含量增加的结果。	Even the chemistry of the land and ocean is changing, with the ocean becoming more acidic – thus threatening coral reefs – as a result of higher carbon dioxide.
意大利和法国的政治和经济弱势，以及英国的逐渐从欧盟事务中抽身凸显出德国在当前危机中捍卫欧元区的关键作用。	The political and economic weakness of France and Italy, together with Britain’s gradual withdrawal from EU affairs, highlight Germany’s key role in rescuing the eurozone from the current crisis.
如果我们只依赖双边协议，推动在困难的关键问题上达成共识的共同空间和协同将越来越窄直至消失，从气候变化到安全问题都是如此。	If we depend solely on bilateral deals, the shared spaces and synergies that facilitate agreement on difficult but vital topics – from climate change to security – will narrow until they disappear.
这一回，美联储依然是断然否认：2009年以来，如果不是QE压低了发达国家的利率，追逐收益率将不会导致新兴市场被短期“热”钱吞没。	It remains steeped in denial: Were it not for the interest-rate suppression that QE has imposed on developed countries since 2009, the search for yield would not have flooded emerging economies with short-term “hot” money.
更令人惊讶的是，哥本哈根政治家们自信地宣称，现在减排二氧化碳终将使这座城市及其居民更加富裕，化石燃料价格上涨后今天昂贵的绿色能源投资终将带来回报。	More surprisingly, Copenhagen’s politicians have confidently declared that cutting CO2 now will ultimately make the city and its citizens wealthier, with today’s expensive green-energy investments more than paying off when fossil-fuel prices rise.
去年签署的八国集团协定同意免除18个最贫困国家的债务¾这18个国家中的16个来自非洲，另外两个来自拉美。 这份协议开了个好头，但是还远远不够。	The G-8 countries’ agreement last year to a debt write-off for the 18 poorest states – 16 in Africa and two in Latin America – is a splendid, but insufficient, beginning.
而在其2027年全面实施时，它将增加大多数中间阶层美国人（位于收入分布中段的那60 % ） 的缴税额。	And, when fully implemented (in 2027), it will increase taxes on a majority of Americans in the middle (the second, third, and fourth quintiles).
但是，最近，欧洲大陆遇到了关于如何解决这一问题的意识形态僵局，环境可持续性和经济增长常常被描述为水火不容。	Lately, however, the continent has reached an ideological impasse over how to address the problem, with environmental sustainability and growth often portrayed as being mutually exclusive.
事实上，若不能在各层次同时实现高质量教育 — — 从学前教育直到大学或同等学力职业培训 — — 就实现包容增长模式就几乎无望。	Indeed, without high-quality education at all levels – from preschool through university or the equivalent professional training – it is nearly impossible to achieve inclusive growth patterns.
任何产品创新都需要一系列的创意，搞清它们对最终成果相对贡献其可能性可以说微乎其微，更不用说分清哪些是最新创意了。	The creation of any product requires many ideas, and sorting out their relative contribution to the outcome – let alone which ones are really new – can be nearly impossible.
不过，虽然聚变过程产生了一定能量（具体来讲是1，600万瓦特 ） ， 科学家们还没有成功完成能自我持续的核聚变“燃烧”过程。	But, while the fusion process has produced some power (16 million watts of it, to be specific), scientists have yet to create a self-sustaining fusion “burn.”
雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安的新当选政府那时就开始了一系列雄心勃勃的改革，以满足欧盟对其成员国的政治标准。	Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s newly elected government had embarked on a series of ambitious reforms to meet the European Union’s political criteria for membership.
"当被问及接受特奥·范霍赫采访时有何感想，欧盟执行委员鲍克斯坦说 ： "" 他直截了当是件好事；可莽撞无礼就不是了 。 """	"When asked what it was like to be interviewed by Theo van Gogh, European Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said, ""He was impertinent, and that is a good thing; he was offensive, and that is not."""
我们欧洲人可以划定我们自己的红线，警告俄罗斯，如果越线，我们将收紧对俄制裁，因为从此以后它将为其叙利亚附庸的罪行负责。	We in Europe can draw our own red line, warning Russia that, if the line is crossed, we will increase sanctions against it as a state henceforth held to be responsible for the crimes of its Syrian vassal.
一些出资人 — — 如法国、德国和欧洲投资银行 — — 正在游说经合组织发展援助委员会将无补贴贷款列为ODA，以使它们实现它们的ODA目标。	And some donors – such as France, Germany, and the European Investment Bank – are lobbying the OECD Development Assistance Committee to count unsubsidized loans as official development assistance to enable them to meet their ODA targets.
而且，在联合国气候谈判中，他们已经提出了全新的解决办法：一项名为减少因森林砍伐和森林退化而造成碳排放 （REDD+）的行动计划。	And, at UN climate talks, they have come up with a novel solution: an initiative called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
尽管北冰洋在夏天冰雪消融，但在一年中多数时候却都是冰雪覆盖，冰川融化所形成的冰山不仅越来越大，也越来越常见。	Even if the Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free in the summer, most of the year it is not, and icebergs from melting glaciers will become more common and possibly larger.
巴黎 — — 法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙将预定于2019年5月举行的欧洲议会选举认定为不光是传统右翼和左翼党派之间的斗争，还包括民粹主义者和像他自己一样的亲欧洲进步人士。	PARIS – French President Emmanuel Macron has framed the European Parliament election in May 2019 as a battle not between the traditional right and left, but between populists and pro-European progressives like himself.
一个软弱的过渡时期政府—或外来占领方的权力机构—不应该试图实施诸如国家资源私有化这样的政策，尤其在这样做可能引发政治对抗的情况下。	A weak interim national government – or a United Nations or foreign occupying administration – should not attempt to implement policies such as privatizing national resources when doing so might incite political resistance.
我们有理由去否定麦克阿斯基尔的决定，但我们同时也必须承认 — — 除非事情另有隐情 — — 他是被我们所能实践的某种最崇高的价值所感召。	We can reasonably disagree with MacAskill’s decision, but we should acknowledge that – unless there is more going on than appears on the surface – he was motivated by some of the finest values we are capable of exercising.
欧盟各国对高敏感度情报以及治安信息的交流程度堪称前所未有，并因此在确保高度法制和民主的同时提升了公共安全。	EU member states share highly sensitive intelligence and police information as never before, thereby increasing public security while upholding world-class legal and democratic standards.
但是，更有可能的是，在经历了多年的缓慢复苏后，美国经济也许终于已经准备好大步向前了，至少可以维持一段时间。	Still, it is far more likely that after years of slow recovery, the US economy might at last be ready to move significantly faster, at least for a while.
不出意料，在整个社会都承受着空前经济压力时央行竟敢公开出手援助特定金融机构，很快就令央行独立性这个概念成为了政治雷区。	Not surprisingly, the notion of independence for central banks that visibly aided specific financial institutions – and this at a time when society as a whole was under unprecedented economic stress – quickly became politically toxic.
虽然将萨科齐比做通敌卖国的马绍尔·贝当维希政权显然是有点夸张，但罗卡尔的忧虑也是许多法国人的感受 — — 而且不仅限于知识分子和权威专家。	Equating Sarkozy with Marshal Pétain’s collaborationist Vichy regime is, of course, an exaggeration, but Rocard’s concerns are shared by many French – and not only intellectuals and pundits.
因此，禁止同性恋行为的根本问题不在于国家用法律来实行某种道德观，而在于该法律是建立在认为同性恋不道德的错误观点之上。	The underlying problem with prohibiting homosexual acts, then, is not that the state is using the law to enforce private morality. It is that the law is based on the mistaken view that homosexuality is immoral.
要在不同文化的国家之间进行对比会比较困难，但是同样的结果也出现在一个国家的内部，除开那些极低收入水平的人，比如在美国年收入低于12000美元的人。	Comparisons between countries with different cultures are difficult, but the same effect appears within countries, except at very low income levels, such as below $12,000 annually for the US.
另一个重要性下降的政策领域是内部市场 — — 这是一个值得关注的决定，因为自1958年欧盟成立以来，它一直是欧洲工程的核心。	Another policy area that has lost its centrality is the internal market – a notable decision, given that it has been the centerpiece of the European project since the Commission was created in 1958.
欧盟或许已经在走下坡路，但基辅独立广场（Maidan Square）的壮观景象有力地提醒我们，欧洲的核心价值仍具有吸引力。	The shine may have come off the EU, but the gripping scenes from Kyiv’s Maidan Square are a powerful reminder of the enduring appeal of Europe’s core values.
这种方式已经在当地的非暴力抵抗运动中得以显现，同样体现这一新潮流的还有国际社会施压以色列的抵制、撤资和制裁运动（BDS ） 。	Such an approach has been exemplified in local non-violent resistance movements, as well as the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement to pressure Israel at the international level.
该机构2009年脱胎自昔日的金融稳定性论坛，基本上没有任何权力，也没有正式地位，直到最近才成为独立法律实体。	That body, which emerged from the old Financial Stability Forum in 2009 with few powers and no formal status, has only recently become a separate legal entity.
不，无论我们是否愿意承认，真正的区别是中共政府成功地将其人口中的很大一部分全球化了，远远超过印度民主政府所达到的水平。	No, the real difference – whether we like to admit it or not – is that China’s communist government has succeeded in globalizing a much larger share of its population than India’s democratic government has managed to do.
金融系统变得更为集中，导致银行问题进一步恶化 — — 它们不仅规模太大，关联和联系太紧密以致无法任由其破产，而且更加难以管理和对公众负责。	The financial system has become even more concentrated, exacerbating the problem of banks that are not only too big, too interconnected, and too correlated to fail, but that are also too big to manage and be held accountable.
风险已经改变 — — 并且已经从银行系统转移出去 — — 因此监管者和监督者必须采取行动，将注意力扩大到银行之外。	Because risks have morphed – and migrated out of the banking system – regulators and supervisors will have to step up their efforts and widen their focus to see beyond the banks.
在“经济和就业”类的前十大观点中有三个与增加大银行约束有关 — — 而对于“拆分花旗集团 ” （ Break Up Citigroup）的支持更是急剧增加（充分披露：该主题由我建议该网站列出 ） 。	Three of the top ten ideas under “Economy & Jobs” are about imposing greater constraints on the big banks – and there is a sharp upward trend in support for Break Up Citigroup (full disclosure: I suggested this item for the website).
它们似乎想要先把私人部门吓怕，这样一来，在财政大斧头真正砍下来的时候，消费者和投资者才会相信大难已经避免，从而增加支出。	It as if they are trying to terrorize the private sector, so that when the fiscal ax actually falls, consumers and investors will be sufficiently relieved that disaster has been averted that they will increase spending.
无论如何，美国应该强力领导世界的前提建立在这样的观点上：没有仁慈的超级霸权充当世界警察，世界就会陷入混乱，就会有邪恶势力主宰世界。	Either way, the premise that the US should lead forcefully rests on the idea that without a benevolent hegemonic power to police the world, chaos will ensue and more malevolent forces will take over.
萨普的回答可能不是最聪明的，但是如果评委对印度人是多么渴望在体育上取得成功有任何的了解的话，他们就会明白她不是在表达一个很荒谬的要务。	Sapre’s answer might not have been the brightest, but if the judges had any idea of how desperate Indians are for sporting success, they would have understood that she was not expressing such an absurd priority.
当前，有人将危机和日本20世纪90年代的经历进行对比 — — 这是日本“失去的十年 ” ， 在经济方面它也削弱了日本执政的自民党的正当性。	Currently, parallels are being drawn to Japan’s experience in the 1990’s – a “lost decade” in economic terms that also undermined the legitimacy of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
就目前而言，奥巴马依然深陷在美国国内卫生法案的政治斗争当中难以自拔，而且也难以及时地为即将给京都议定书制定后续协议的哥本哈根峰会做点什么。	Obama is still fighting back home for his healthcare initiative, and is hamstrung from acting on climate change in time for the Copenhagen summit, which is to agree on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol.
自2012年成立Rappler以来，路易萨的网站已经公开了与杜特尔特总统“禁毒战”法外处决信息有关的大量宝贵资料。	Since founding Rappler in 2012, Ressa’s website has become an invaluable source of information about the extrajudicial killings linked to President Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs.”
宏观经济行为的结构主义视角引出了一个被称为“自然”失业率的概念。 这个概念借用两次世界大战期间在欧洲出现的“自然”利率的概念。	The structuralist perspective on macroeconomic behavior led to the concept that came to be called the “natural” rate of unemployment, borrowing from the notion, which arose in Europe during the interwar years, of a “natural” interest rate.
有几个国家已经开始推行强调预防和治疗而非打击的政策 — — 并将重点放到真正的敌人身上，那就是有组织犯罪。	Several countries are pursuing policies that emphasize prevention and treatment rather than repression – and refocusing their repressive measures on fighting the real enemy: organized crime.
事实上，这场尤先科和特莫申科领导的和平革命提醒了我们基辅在被迫让路给专制的莫斯科之前文明发展到多么高的程度。	Indeed, that peaceful revolution, led by Viktor Yushchenko and Yuliya Tymoshenko, was a reminder of how enlightened Kievan Rus had been before it was forced to give way to the despotic princes of Moscow.
在蒂勒森漫长的国际交易经验中 — — 这和外交并不是一回事 — — 他与俄罗斯总统普京建立了紧密的关系，而特朗普对普京的太对相当“软 ” 。	In his extensive international deal-making – which isn’t the same as diplomacy – Tillerson has developed a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, toward whom Trump has been notably soft.
这一新管道包围乌克兰、波兰当然还有波罗地海三国，将会为俄罗斯在寻求地区影响力的过程中提供更大的手段。	By circumventing Ukraine, Poland, and of course, the Baltic countries, the new pipeline promises greater leverage to the Kremlin as it seeks to reassert itself regionally.
当中国的高速工业发展提升了对德国传统出口需求的同时，欧元也为德国在欧洲南部地区创造了极为蓬勃的外部需求。	Until recently, the euro also provided booming external demand in southern Europe, while China’s breakneck industrial development raised demand for Germany’s traditional exports.
从工业革命到现在，西方的发展一直没有受到任何环境方面的约束，因此新兴国家认为，调整成本不应该由它们来承担。	From the Industrial Revolution until very recently, the West’s development was free of any environmental restrictions, and the emerging countries believe that they should not have to bear the adjustment cost.
2008年，美联储与十个发达经济体的中央银行建立了货币互换机制，其中包括欧元区，英国，日本，瑞士，和四个新兴经济体（巴西，韩国，墨西哥，新加坡 ） 。	In 2008, the Fed established currency-swap lines with the central banks of ten developed economies, including the eurozone, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland, and four emerging economies (Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, and Singapore).
同样令人恐怖的是，最严重的迫害对准了耶西迪人（Yedizi，与库尔德人一起生活的古老宗教群体 ） 。	As terrible as all of this is, the worst of the persecution has been aimed at the Yezidi, an ancient religious group that lives among the Kurds.
理查德·尼克松就是一个最好的例子，虽然他从来没有表达过对犹太人的好感，但不用质疑，在他的执政时期，以色列仍然是白宫最坚定的盟友。	That was clearly the case with Richard Nixon, who never suffered from an excess of love for Jews, but was nonetheless one of the staunchest allies that Israel ever had in the White House.
世界反兴奋剂机构（WADA）早在2003年就禁止使用基因兴奋剂，但有些科学家仍然认为，滥用基因兴奋剂的情况很可能会在2008年北京奥运会中出现。	The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibited gene doping in 2003, but some scientists predict that its misuse in sport is likely to appear at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.
意大利和西班牙政府指出，它们的高借贷成本基本上是兑换风险的反映，欧洲央行应该采取一切必要手段纠正这一问题。	The Italian and Spanish governments argue that their high borrowing costs largely reflect convertibility risks, and that the ECB should do as much as necessary to address them.
事实上，中国经济的真实状况早已无法摸透，但因目前更严厉的监管而暴露出来 — — 比如将人民币的投机交易粉饰成贸易支付。	In fact, the Chinese economy’s true condition had long been obscured, but has now been exposed by more stringent regulation of activities such as speculative trading of the renminbi masquerading as trade payments.
该国经济实际是权贵资本主义的一个变种，经济成功并非来自于孕育了自由的自由市场竞争，而是取决于谁在政界有“关系 ” 。	Its economy is a variant of crony capitalism, in which economic success depends on one’s political connections, rather than on the meritocratic free-market competition from which liberty grows.
发自纽黑文 — — 最近出现的全球经济走弱迹象令许多人开始思考未来几年的恶劣经济表现究竟会蔓延到何种地步。	NEW HAVEN – Recent indications of a weakening global economy have led many people to wonder how pervasive poor economic performance will be in the coming years.
法国评论员赫尔·加文（Hervé Juvin）在他2005年的黑马作品《身体的起源》中赞扬了这种新态度。	The French commentator Hervé Juvin extolled this new attitude towards the body in his 2005 surprise bestseller, L’avènement du corps (The Coming of the Body) .
而这类结构性变革有时会同时具备得益和破坏的双重属性，对此政策制定者们一直以来都奋力想在抽象的开放原则和具体措施之间找寻平衡，以避免变革所导致的最恶劣影响。	Structural change can be simultaneously beneficial and disruptive. And policymakers have long had to strike a balance between the abstract principle of openness and concrete measures to limit the worst effects of change.
这一在2005年联合国大会一致通过的原则在其他地区都能良好地贯彻，包括支持2008年对肯尼亚的外交干预。	That principle, unanimously agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2005, has been successfully invoked elsewhere, including in support of diplomatic intervention in Kenya in 2008.
这在推高了美元价值的同时也长期削弱了美国的出口竞争力，正如伦敦金融城提供的金融产品在对其欧盟成员国资格毫无异议的年代里推高了英镑，打击了英国出口那样。	This has driven up the dollar’s value and chronically undermined export competitiveness, much like the financial products offered by the City of London did in the UK by fueling sterling appreciation in the years of undisputed EU membership.
说服大国销毁核武器或许看上去就像让美国国会通过枪支管制法一样在政治上想入非非，但在这个问题上，奥巴马已经明确表示自己愿意尝试。	Convincing great powers to eliminate their nuclear arsenals might seem as politically fanciful as pushing gun-control legislation through the US Congress, but on that issue, too, Obama has made clear that he is willing to try.
如果一项政策能大大提振国内经济，给外国带来的负面溢出效应只是暂时的，那么也应该获得绿灯（这项政策对外国经济也是有益的，因为最终本国经济的进口需求将得到提振 ） 。	A policy could also be green if it jump-starts the home economy with only temporary negative spillovers for the foreign economy (the policy will still be good for the foreign economy by eventually boosting the home economy’s demand for imports).
索马里兰可以算做盟友之一，这个国家以前曾是英国的保护国，1991年从索马里独立，位于埃塞俄比亚的东北部。	One such ally could be Somaliland, the former British protectorate, which broke away from Somalia in 1991 and lies to the northeast of Ethiopia.
香港 — — 世界领导人将于本周末的法国戛纳G20峰会上聚首，而他们将面临的下一个经济雷区已经浮现在了眼前。	HONG KONG – With world leaders meeting at the end of this week at the G-20 summit in Cannes, France, the next economic minefield that they will face is already coming into view.
比如，埃及新旧军事统治者认定，美国的批评可以忽略，因为出于地缘政治原因，美国不可能取消对埃及的援助。	Egypt’s old-new military rulers, for example, have concluded that American criticism can be ignored, because America cannot cut off its aid to Egypt for geopolitical reasons.
但在长期，它可能减少美国就业，缩小北美占全球市场的比例，并破坏美国在国际贸易问题上的信誉 — — 与此同时也无法降低美国经常项目赤字。	But in the long run, it will likely reduce US employment, shrink North America’s share of the global auto market, and undermine America’s credibility on international trade issues – all while failing to reduce the US current-account deficit.
从更广的角度，尽管我的祖国身处千钧一发之势，但乌克兰应该获得清晰的路线图走出当前的安全“灰色地带 ” ， 走向欧洲-大西洋未来。	"More broadly, despite the highly charged situation in our country, Ukraine deserves a clear road map out of its current security “grey zone"" and toward a Euro-Atlantic future."
我知道民主的辉煌时代曾被践踏，1956年在布达佩斯，1968年在布拉格，以及1989年在天安门广场。	I know that stirrings of democracy have been crushed before: in Budapest in 1956, Prague in 1968, and in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
小学和中学的努力有助于在女生中培养更多样化的兴趣，让有才华的年轻女性获得她们所需要的工具，在关键经济部门做出重要贡献。	Efforts by primary and secondary schools could help to foster more diverse interests among female students, giving talented young women the tools they need to make important contributions to key economic sectors.
要说谁懂得行胜于言的道理，那一定是普京 — — 他经常断然否认证据确凿的坏事，比如干预美国选举和违反条约。	If anyone knows that actions speak louder than words, it is Putin, whose words often include transparent denials of documented wrongdoing, from meddling in the US election to violating treaties.
但是，为了赢得美国的重视，欧盟需要拿出设计完善而且资源配置合理的方案，而不是随随便便地提出27条不成熟的想法。	But, in order to be taken seriously by the US, the EU needs to bring well-developed, well-resourced policies to the table, rather than 27 half-baked ideas.
在侍从军官行刺企图失败后，达迪斯·卡马拉逃往国外，接替他的临时军政府领袖赛古巴·科纳特将军允许反对党任命一位平民总理。	Following an assassination attempt by an aide-de-camp, Dadis Camara fled the country, and the interim junta leader, General Sékouba Konaté, allowed the opposition political parties to appoint a civilian prime minister.
回顾他的一生，阿拉法特从未真正改变过自己的信仰：那就是把不惜一切手段毁灭以色列，代之以巴勒斯坦阿拉伯国家当作自己的终身目标。	Looking back at his career, Arafat never really veered from the belief that his life's mission was to destroy Israel by any means necessary and replace it with a Palestinian Arab state.
鉴于会议内容往往要临场确定，要确保有限度营销确实存在一定难度；发言人可能会出人意料地利用讲台宣传某种产品，这么做可能导致他/她被从今后的邀请名单上排除。	Given that the content is being created in real time, this can be challenging; a speaker may unexpectedly use the stage to promote a product, in which case he or she would probably not be invited back.
更世俗的真理是，昔日维持伊斯兰世界和平的是奥斯曼、不列颠和法兰西帝国，在它们分崩离析后，一直没有稳定的继任者产生。	The more mundane truth is that there have never been any stable successors to the defunct Ottoman, British, and French empires that used to keep the peace in the Islamic world.
En outre, même si la Commission européenne a clairement le devoir de d’empêcher la mauvaise gestion et la fraude, il se trouve que chaque demande de financement de l’UE demande des procédures extrêmement onéreuses.	Moreover, although the European Commission clearly has a duty to prevent mismanagement and fraud, every application for EU funding requires extremely onerous procedures.
如果说斯大林的道德记录有什么“模糊不清”的地方，可能是共产主义于我们的崇高目标 — — 人人平等、终结贫穷 — — 有共鸣之处。	If there is any “ambiguity” about Stalin’s moral record, it may be because communism strikes a chord with some of our nobler impulses, seeking equality for all and an end to poverty.
然而，即使许多公正和发展党的激进分子和选民都是虔诚的穆斯林，埃尔多安和居尔仍然致力于加入欧洲的一体化。	Yet, even if many AKP activists and voters are devout Muslims, Erdogan and Gul remain committed to European integration.
随着全球经济增长回暖以及某些地缘政治不确定性的出现（可能会限制一些产油国的产量 ） ， 目前油价已回升至每桶60美元以上。	With the pickup in global growth and the emergence of geopolitical uncertainties (which could constrain output in some oil-producing countries), oil prices have rebounded to above $60 per barrel.
该办法既更加累进，也更加有效：资本是高度流动的，因此从公民个人和股东居民头上征税要比从跨国公司头上征税容易得多。	It is both more progressive and more effective: with highly mobile capital, it is far easier to collect taxes from individual citizens and resident shareholders than from multinational companies.
在法国和阿拉伯国家关系方面，可以肯定地说，奥朗德同意奥巴马2009年开罗演讲的提倡包容（pro-engagement）的观点。	With regard to relations between France and the Arab world, one can be certain that Hollande would agree with the pro-engagement thrust of Obama’s 2009 Cairo speech.
我们应该停止愚蠢的害怕，停止追寻愚蠢的政策并且开始投资于长远的、聪明的研发项目。 “反人类罪”的指责必须停止。	We have to stop being scared silly, stop pursuing stupid policies, and start investing in smart long-term R&D. Accusations of “crimes against humanity” must cease.
如果观察员能体会言外之意并大量观察那些没有按照本来面目表述的东西，下任美国总统外交策的观点可以看清楚了。	Aspects of the next president’s foreign policy are there to see if observers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is.
这一可能性大小是一个连续变量，从比如O（可恶的压迫性独裁统治）直到W（管理良好、功能完善的民主 ） 。	The scale would be continuous, going from, say, O (odious repressive dictatorships) to W (well-managed and fully functioning democracies).
约旦与以色列签署的和平条约的第三和第八条款明确将难民问题作为一个主要的亟需解决的问题，同时还引证了越国界管理和耶路撒冷未解决的状况。	Articles 3 and 8 of Jordan’s peace treaty with Israel refer explicitly to the refugee problem as one of the major issues still to be resolved, as well as citing the unresolved status of trans-border arrangements and of Jerusalem.
爱尔兰在成为欧盟成员国的35年内几乎享受了不成比例的好处，到了2008年时还从欧盟预算中净赚了5亿欧元。	Ireland has benefited disproportionately from EU largesse during its 35 years of membership, and, in 2008, was still receiving a net sum of €500 million from the EU budget.
长期以来，沙特阿拉伯通过向臣民发放巨额石油财富，以及在沙特社会推行基于严格的瓦哈比派传统的原教旨伊斯兰教保持（相对）内部稳定。	Saudi Arabia has long maintained (relative) internal stability by spreading its enormous oil wealth among its subjects, and by imposing on Saudi society fundamentalist Islamic doctrines based on the austere Wahhabi tradition.
伊丽莎白女王二世有过著名的一问：经济学家为何不能预见灾难？ 她或许要求太高了些，但一个众人皆有的感觉是经济学家的研究有很多属于“无厘头 ” 。	Queen Elizabeth II may have expected too much when she famously asked why economists had failed to foresee the disaster, but there is a widespread sense that much of their research turned out to be irrelevant.
库普乾认为，外交才是战略融合和互信的基本要素，而具有相似社会秩序和民族成分的国家间更容易建立和谐的外交关系。	Rather, he regards diplomatic engagement as the essential element to strategic accommodation and mutual trust, and this is more easily accomplished if the states have similar social orders and ethnicities.
如果欧洲领导人认真对待COP21承诺，就应该在2030年在2010年消费水平的基础上减少70 % ， 这一目标比欧洲理事会2014年的目标宏大一倍。	If European leaders are serious about their COP21 commitment, they should embrace a 70% reduction on 2010 consumption levels by 2030 – more than double the European Council’s 2014 target.
分离主义分子重提18世纪英国的暴行，并称苏格兰可以借此保有全部的北海石油储量，并且不再分担英国的债务。	The secessionists hark back to eighteenth-century English brutality and claim that Scotland will be able to keep all of its North Sea oil and shed its share of the UK’s debt.
这导致那些赤字国家只能通过通货紧缩的方式来调整实际汇率 — — 但这会引发公共和私人负债持续上升，最终导致大规模的信用违约	This is forcing deficit countries into real exchange-rate adjustments via deflation – and thus a rising burden of public and private debt that may lead to disorderly defaults.
举例来讲，二十世纪七十年代秘鲁批准安第斯山脉民众有权使用驼羊毛挽救了濒于灭绝的驼羊并为当地民众创造了长期的新的收入流。	For example, in the 1970s when Peru granted Andean communities the right to use vicuña wool, it saved the vicuña from extinction and created new, long-term income streams for the community.
真正的原因在于新闻审查制度，这场爆炸其实正代表了亚美尼亚匿影藏形的反新闻界集团对新闻界发起的最新攻击。	But the real problem is censorship, for the explosion was but the latest offensive in Armenia’s hidden war against the press.
因为全球教育合作机构的资助，从2002到2014年间发展中国家接受小学教育的女童增加了3，800万人。	Thanks to GPE funding, an additional 38 million girls in developing countries were enrolled in primary school from 2002 to 2014.
如果风险资本家蒂姆·德拉珀（Tim Draper）将加利福尼亚分成六个州的错误计划成功，硅谷将是美国最富有的州，而中央山谷将是最贫穷的州。	If the venture capitalist Tim Draper had succeeded in his misguided initiative to divide California into six states, Silicon Valley would have become the richest state in the US, and the Central Valley the poorest.
诚然，特朗普和其他民粹主义者经常试图通过声称集会中有“危机演员”或“付费积极分子”来诋毁真正的抗议活动。	True, Trump and other populists often try to discredit bona fide protests by claiming that they are stocked with “crisis actors” or “paid activists.”
主角一步步向地下贩毒网堕落的过程被描写得极为详尽，在此过程中，他所作出的每一个决定几乎都是十分理性的。	The main protagonist’s step-by-step descent into the drug underworld unfolds with such subtlety that each individual decision he makes along the way seems almost reasonable.
最后，药物进入市场，也必须对其进行严格跟踪，因为许多不良反应要经过众多病人多年的使用之后才能被发现。	Finally, the drug reaches the market, where it must be followed closely, because many adverse reactions are detected only with a large number of patients and after years of use.
逆转这一趋势在银行联盟的三大关键要素���—共同监管者、共同存款保险和共同清算基金 — — 都切实具备之前是不可能的。	Reversal of that process will likely not occur until the three key elements of banking union – common supervision, common deposit insurance, and a common resolution fund – are within tangible reach.
中国对日本处于美国保护之下的状态相对感到满意，因为它担心另一种情况：一个扩展其独立军事影响力的日本。	It is relatively content with Japan being a US security protectorate, because it fears the alternative: a Japan that expands its independent military reach.
同样可能被视为作弊的还有要求以技术转让换取市场准入、偏向于国内实体的公共采购、接受不安全的工作环境及剥削性的劳动行为，还有汇率操纵。	So may requiring technology transfer in exchange for market access, public procurement favoring domestic entities, acceptance of unsafe work environments and exploitative labor practices, and exchange-rate manipulation.
最近围绕世界银行行长Paul Wolfowitz辞职的纷扰凸现了推进世行良好治理和反腐败议程的必要性。	The recent turbulence surrounding the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz from the Presidency of the World Bank has underscored the need to push ahead with the Bank’s good governance and anti-corruption agenda.
一般认为俄乌两国之所以不愿做为，是因为两国政府都将注射吸毒者视为罪犯而非需要救治的病人，因此宁愿让这些人自生自灭。	The popular explanation for lack of action in Russia and Ukraine is that their governments view IDUs as criminals, rather than people with a disease, and adopt an informal let-them-rot policy.
我们还可以认为这些措施会在2013年1月结束，届时将会有新动作，抛出新措施的既可能是连任的奥巴马，也可能是新的共和党总统。	And we can assume that it would be repealed and replaced by something else come January 2013, either by a re-elected President Barack Obama, or by a new, Republican president.
事实上，两项著名的纵向研究 — — 马萨诸塞州的弗莱明汉姆心脏研究（Framingham Heart Study）和瑞典的国王岛项目（Kungsholmen Project）在阿尔茨海默症的预测方面获得了重要进展。	In fact, two famous longitudinal studies – the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts and the Kungsholmen Project in Sweden – have led to important progress in predicting the disease.
今天，将俄国和中国联系在一起的已经不仅仅是两国的能源协议，这两个国家都认定，属于他们的时代已经到来。 世界需要他们更甚于他们需要世界，而美国尤其如此。	Russia and China today are united not only by their energy deals, but also by both countries’ conviction that their time has come, and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world, particularly the US.
尽管报告对国际合作这一方向持首肯态度，但它违反了国际共识，增加了不可逆转的基因改变风险和新的不平等形式。	Although the report nods in the direction of international cooperation, it breaches an international consensus in a way that increases the risks of irreversible genetic alterations and new forms of inequality.
巴方已经满足了以方以及国际社会提出的所有安全要求，而在两国方案上言而无信的内塔尼亚胡政府却依然不愿划定本方边界。	Palestinians complied with all Israeli and international requirements for security, while Binyamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government, which gives lip-service to the two-state solution, has yet to elucidate where Israel’s borders will be.
去年12月，公诉人指控萨哈罗夫博物馆的两名官员和三名展览组织者煽动宗教仇恨，他们面临长达5年的牢狱生涯。	Last December, prosecutors charged two Sakharov Museum officials and three of the exhibition's organizers with inciting religious hatred. They now face prison terms of up to five years.
在美国和许多欧洲国家，平均工资停滞不前，尽管从GDP和就业增长角度看，大部分经济体已经从2008年金融危机中复苏。	In the United States and many European countries, average salaries have stagnated, despite most economies having recovered from the 2008 financial crisis in terms of GDP and job growth.
过去10年来肺结核发病数的年下降率仅有1.65 % ； 而2014年一年，肺结核就夺去了150万人的生命。	The annual decline in cases over the past decade has been a mere 1.65%; in 2014, TB killed 1.5 million people.
所有非洲开发银行支持的废水管理系统都遵循可持续发展原则，以确保能提高经济收益、惠及当地社会并让当地民众负担得起相应的费用。	All AfDB-supported wastewater-management systems follow sustainability strategies to ensure that they enhance economic gains, benefit local communities, and remain affordable.
印度人民党假装这是一次中立行动，哪怕在因甄别“外国人”而额首相庆的同时，仍然强调整个过程都接受最高法院的监督。	The BJP pretends that this is a neutral exercise, emphasizing that the Supreme Court supervised the process, even as it celebrates the identification of “foreigners.”
斯堪的纳维亚人早就想通了这一点：它是维持一个开放社会 — — 全球化和技术变革开放 — — 的社会契约的一部分。	The Scandinavians figured this out long ago; it was part of the social contract that maintained an open society – open to globalization and changes in technology.
堪培拉 — — 当美国总统唐纳德·特朗普突然取消与朝鲜领导人金正恩的首脑会晤，他将原因归咎于朝鲜的公开敌意和巨大愤怒。	CANBERRA – When US President Donald Trump abruptly canceled his summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, he blamed “tremendous anger and open hostility” from the North.
最后，该赌注认为石油出口国 — — 如尼日利亚、委内瑞拉，特别还有俄罗斯 — — 将成功避免经济崩溃，即使全球油价暴跌。	Finally, the bet assumes that oil-exporting countries like Nigeria, Venezuela, and especially Russia will fend off economic implosion, even as global oil prices plummet.
即使是在言论自由受到严格保护的美国，此类煽动性言论也会遭到起诉和严惩，只要它与暴力和其他非法行为扯上关系。	Even in the US, where freedom of expression is zealously protected, such incitement may be prosecuted and punished in circumstances in which violence or other unlawful behavior is imminent.
如今，像伊斯兰国和尼日利亚博科圣地这样的组织已经加入了基地组织的队伍，诱惑世界各地的穆斯林民众，从而确保对全球圣战运动的领导。	Today, groups like the Islamic State and Nigeria’s Boko Haram have joined Al Qaeda in a struggle to attract Muslims from all over the world, thereby securing their leadership in global jihad.
事实上，福岛第一核电站防护海塘遇袭之后几小时甚至几天内所发生的事情尽管令人震惊，却称得上是核电安全性的一次有力证明。	In fact, although what happened was shocking, the events in the hours and days after a giant wave slammed over the nuclear plant’s protective seawall might be interpreted as a remarkable testament to nuclear power’s sound credentials.
雅典 — — “希腊有史以来代价最昂贵的局部政府改组 ” ， 这至少是形容9月20日希腊大选结果的一种方式。	ATHENS – “The costliest minor government reshuffle in Greece’s history.” That is at least one way to describe the result of the Greek general election on September 20.
但没有伊朗的联盟实际已成为逊尼派阵线，伊朗本应参与谈判并在平息叙利亚内战中发挥更显著的作用。 但这一切的前提是伊朗愿意签署协议控制其核计划。	Iran, without which the coalition essentially becomes a Sunni front, can have a place at the table – and play a large and overt role in resolving the Syrian civil war – but only if it is willing to reach a deal to rein in its nuclear program.
多数历史学家都认为恐怖的伊凡名副其实；他不仅杀害了他的儿子和其他亲属，还下令执行1565到1572年令俄国陷入恐怖氛围的由国家主导的清洗运动（oprichnina ） 。	Most historians agree that Ivan lived up to his name; not only did he kill his son and other relatives, he also ordered the oprichnina, the state-led purges that terrorized Russia from 1565 to 1572.
现在去岛上希腊塞浦路斯聚居地参观的人不会再看到难民营：成百上千万的游客多数都不会想到，他们碰到超过三分之一的希腊塞浦路斯人或者是难民、或者是难民的后裔。	Anyone visiting the Greek Cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps: most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the Greek Cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees.
发展中国家目前面临更高的通胀率并非是因为宏观管理不善，而是由于石油和食品价格在窜升。 与富国相比，这些项目在平均家庭预算中占据更大的比例。	Developing countries currently face higher rates of inflation not because of poorer macro-management, but because oil and food prices are soaring, and these items represent a much larger share of the average household budget than in rich countries.
这一在人类帮助下发生的新演化意味着在人类世，我们其实既是旧生物多样性的毁灭者，也是新生物多样性的创造者。	This evolution of new human-associated species means that, in the Anthropocene, we are effectively creators of new biological diversity as well as destroyers of the old.
但如今运用到现代经济领域，这样的赞美在现实中至少是尴尬的：现代经济靠几家央行堆积如山的巨额债务来稳定金融系统。	But, applied to the modern economy, such praise is awkward at best, because it is literally true: the financial system was stabilized by piling huge volumes of debt into a few central banks.
但是我们目前面临的大规模的经常项目不平衡带来的风险之一就是政客可能会指责别的国家，采取保护主义政策。	But one of the risks associated with the large current-account imbalances we now face is that politicians may decide to blame one or another country and espouse protectionist policies.
举例来说，斯堪的那维亚国家、地中海国家以及像爱尔兰和英国那样的“自由的大西洋国家”之间的差别在某些时候要比欧洲整体和美国之间的差别还要大。	The differences for instance between the Scandinavian countries, the Mediterranean countries, and the “liberal Atlantic countries” like Ireland and the UK are sometimes more pronounced than those between Europe as a whole and the US.
正如接受治疗的大鼠的行为不再那么拘谨（更加能够忍受明亮开放的空间 ） ， 接受治疗的焦虑患者也更有可能能够回到工作岗位中。	Just as medicated rats are less behaviorally inhibited (more able to tolerate bright, open spaces), medicated anxiety sufferers are more likely to be able to return to their jobs.
这一模式或许也可以用于政治关系：赫希曼曾写过一篇著名文章，证明了在1989年退出东德的可行性是如何导致忠诚突然崩溃的。	The schema might also be applied to political relations: Hirschman wrote a memorable article showing how the ability to exit East Germany in 1989 produced a sudden breakdown of loyalty.
不论在国内还是国外，分离（disconnect）的现象严重，这给“中国因素”对脆弱世界的影响增加了新的风险维度。	On both counts, the disconnects are striking, adding a new dimension of risk to the impact of the “China factor” on a fragile world.
事实上，在特朗普取胜造成的重大不确定性下，构建新型关系比以往任何时候更具有战略价值，因为全球环境不断变化，而且美中两国都面临着区域地缘政治和国内挑战。	Indeed, amid the vast uncertainty created by Trump’s victory, a new relationship now makes more strategic sense than ever, given changing global circumstances, regional geopolitics, and domestic challenges in both the US and China.
众所周知的、低成本以及低科技含量的防治手段，例如破伤风疫苗、专门母乳、低体重婴儿的简单护理以及防止传染的抗生素等并没有提供给那些最需要得到的孩子。	Well known, low-cost, and low-tech interventions do not reach those most in need – for example immunization against tetanus, exclusive breastfeeding, simple care for low-weight babies, and antibiotics for infection.
尽管如此，即使是迅速实现“更加绿色”的能源转变，也不足以让全球平均气温限定在前工业化水平以上2℃以内。	Still, not even a rapid shift toward “greener” energy will be enough to keep global average temperature within 2º of preindustrial levels.
虽然贾迈勒在埃及掌权已经没有太多障碍，但在阿尔及利亚，将赛义德扶上宝座的努力可能会在强大政权利益的抵制下付诸东流。	While few obstacles remain in Gamal’s path to power in Egypt, in Algeria, meanwhile, a bid to install Said would likely collapse against resistance from powerful regime interests.
可能还有其他办法能够解决问题：那就是像许多市场经济国家那样收紧专利法或对制药等垄断行业实行价格管制。	Other approaches are also possible: tightening up patent laws or imposing price controls for monopolistic industries, such as pharmaceuticals, as many market economies have done.
柏林—据5月初ARD德国趋势（DeutschlandTREND）的民意调查，极右翼的德国另类道路党（Alternative for Germany，AfD）的民众支持率为15 % ， 而一年前只有5 % 。	BERLIN – According to an early May opinion poll by ARD DeutschlandTREND, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party’s popular support now stands at 15%, up from around 5% a year ago.
默克尔有两个选择：她可以右倾，如法国前总统萨科齐为法国总统大选所做的最后一搏那样；她也可以硬碰AfD的简单化立场，坚持中间道路。	Merkel has two choices: She can move to the right, as former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has done in his latest bid for the French presidency, or she can fight to hold the center by addressing the AfD’s simplistic arguments head on.
但另一个有害的传说是“欧洲堡垒”正在遭受一波又一波野蛮人的冲击。 这一传说通过令人震惊的影像传播 — — 大量难民蜂拥通过边境隔离带，或者试图攀上加莱（Calais）的火车 — — 它存在两个层面的错误。	Yet another damaging myth, perpetuated by shocking images of refugees swarming through border fences or attempting to climb onto trains in Calais, is that “Fortress Europe” is under assault by waves of barbarians.
在2016年核安全峰会召开之前，我们最需要的是有一套程序促进全面解决核威胁的全球行动，确保全面禁止核试验条约生效就是其中之一。	What is most needed in the run-up to the 2016 NSS is a process that advances global action to address the nuclear threat comprehensively, including by ensuring that the CTBT enters into force.
那么，IMF给出了“资本流自由化的综合性方针 ” ， 并具体给出了改革的详细步骤，既然如此，关于资本管制和如何使其更有效也不具有什么可比性了。	So, while the Fund lays out an “integrated approach to capital flow liberalization,” and specifies a detailed sequence of reforms, there is nothing remotely comparable on capital controls and how to render them more effective.
NDPO的修改草案似乎认识到这一点，同时强调日本自卫、日美联盟的合作、以及对多边使命做出贡献的必要性。	The draft revision of the NDPO seems to recognize this, emphasizing the need for Japan’s own defense efforts, cooperation through the Japanese-US alliance, and contributions to multilateral missions.
俄罗斯目前向中国销售某些武器，但却避免向其出口最尖端的系统。 因为克里姆林宫将中国看作未来潜在的威胁。	Russia currently sells certain arms to China, but avoids exporting its most sophisticated systems, since the Kremlin views China as a potential future threat.
日益开放的金融市场让外国银行和资产管理者能够迅速甩卖债务 — — 通常是出于与经济基本面无关的理由。	Increasingly open financial markets allow foreign banks and asset managers to dump debts rapidly, often for reasons that have little to do with economic fundamentals.
与此相反，中国的腐败通常都是“利益分享”型，那些国有企业高管的家庭成员都拥有股份，他们的收益随着企业盈利的上升而增加 — — 这是某种促进经济增长的腐败。	By contrast, in China, the corruption has largely been of the “profit-sharing” variety, whereby family members are given a stake in the enterprise so that their earnings increase as profits increase – a type of corruption that promotes growth.
朝鲜领袖金正恩绝非中国邓小平式的改革分子；但因为市场不可逆转的扩张力量，他的政权正日复一日变得与中国越来越相似。	North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is no reformist like China’s Deng Xiaoping; but his regime is becoming more like China’s every day, owing to the irreversible expansion of market forces.
民主党的这项承诺本应是日本新独立自主战略的一部分，只要踏出了第一步，日本就不会再像某位自民党前首相所说的那样，仅仅是美国的一艘“航空母舰 ” 。	This promise by the DPJ was meant to be part of Japan’s new assertiveness, a first step away from being a mere “aircraft carrier” for the US, as a former LDP prime minister once described his country.
美国会愿意向印度出售进攻性武器 — — 包括高精确度常规武器、反潜系统和长程空基和地基巡航导弹 — — 以有助于威慑中国的军事先发制人吗？	Would the US be willing to sell India offensive weapons – including high-precision conventional arms, anti-submarine systems, and long-range air- and sea-launched cruise missiles – that could help to deter Chinese military preemption?
从这一技术官僚观点来看，今天的布鲁塞尔维持了某些功能，而即使在某些民族国家内部，这些功能都经常被分派到不是民主选举产生的机构中。	From this technocratic perspective, Brussels today maintains functions that even within nation states are often delegated to institutions that are not democratically elected.
库尔德人民民主党（Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party，HDP）在最近的大选中大获成功，获得13%选票 — — 远多于该党核心选区的选票比例 — — 这必然会增强库尔德人的信心，有利于和平进程。	The success of the mainly Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) in capturing 13% of the vote in the recent election – a total well above the party’s core constituency – should boost the Kurds’ confidence and ease the way ahead in the peace process.
西方自由民主国家应该如何面对一个按照自己的战略计划行动、利用它们的开放性推动它的意识形态和地缘政治目标的中国？	How should Western liberal democracies confront a China that is taking a page from their own playbook, as it exploits their openness to advance its ideological and geopolitical objectives?
但尽管当局在1999年他们上一次面临严重不良贷款问题用过这招，货币印刷机却无法与官员的另一既定目标相兼容：稳定的汇率。	But, while the authorities relied on this approach in 1999, the last time they were faced with a serious bad-loan problem, running the money printing press is not compatible with officials’ other stated goal: a stable exchange rate.
埃尔多安说他想“让阿夫林回到真正的所有者手中 ” ， 从而让350万土耳其境内叙利亚难民“尽快回到自己的土地上 ” 。	Erdoğan has claimed that he wants “to deliver Afrin to its real owners,” thereby enabling the more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey to return “to their own land as soon as possible.”
如此一来，中、东欧各国的选民们现在觉得政府让他们做了亏本生意也在情理之中：勒紧裤带、劳务市场限制和欧盟规章的狂轰滥炸。	Little wonder, then, that voters in Central and Eastern Europe now feel that they got a poor bargain from the governments that brought them in: belt tightening, labor market restrictions, and the notorious barrage of EU regulation.
鉴于人类有限的阅读速度（每分钟200-300字）和现有的巨大的信息量，当今有效的决策在知识精密化的每一个方面都需要语义技术。	Given humans’ limited reading speed (200-300 words per minute) and the enormous volume of available information, effective decision-making today calls for semantic technology in every aspect of knowledge refinement.
取得险胜的执政者上台后奉行极端主义政策也会造成类似的后果。 有人说乔治·W·布什在美国已经贯彻了这样的做法，很多人害怕奥夫拉多尔（Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador）会领导墨西哥追随布什的后尘。	The same may also be true if narrow winners adopt a radical agenda, as some think George W. Bush has done in America and many feared Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador would do in Mexico.
但他们同时引入了目的完全相反的记忆法：通过将历史暴行的责任完全推给他人 — — 无论是希特勒的德国还是斯大林的苏联 — — 来粉饰国家叙事。	But they have also introduced memory laws with essentially the opposite aim: to whitewash national narratives by shifting the responsibility for historical atrocities entirely onto others, whether Hitler’s Germany or Stalin’s Soviet Union.
相反，目前令人失望的局面正是来自结构改革逻辑：大部分改革的好处要很迟才会到来，而不是在一国真正需要它们时到来。	Instead, the current disappointment arises from the very logic of structural reform: most of the benefits come much later, not when a country really needs them.
2008年11月，载有墨西哥国家安全顾问胡安·卡米罗·马利罗（Juan Camilo Mourino）的飞机神秘坠毁。	In November, 2008, a plane carrying Juan Camilo Mourino, Mexico’s national security advisor, crashed under mysterious circumstances.
但是这一先导性工作现在处于停滞状态，而数以百万计的农民取得有效而对环境无害危机解决途径的希望也停滞了。	But the pioneering work is now on hold, as are the hopes of millions of farmers for an effective, environmentally friendly answer to the crisis.
2008年为数不多的积极结果之一是G-20全球影响力的加强；理论上，G-20是远比G-7代表性更强的国际领导力论坛。	One of the few positive consequences of the 2008 financial crisis was the elevation of the G-20's global role; in principle, it is a far more representative forum for international leadership than the G-7 ever was.
普瑞德-威利综合症则有如下特征，肌张力差，性激素水平低下以及大脑控制饱饿感的部分出现缺陷，从而导致过度进食和肥胖。	Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by poor muscle tone, low levels of sex hormones, and a defect in the part of the brain that controls feelings of satiety or hunger, which leads to overeating and obesity.
尽管ICC的总检察官Luis Moreno-Ocampo表示有信心将巴希尔绳之以法，但究竟如何操作还是个未知数。	While the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, expresses confidence that Bashir will be brought to justice, it is unclear how this will happen.
正如在线支付系统PayPal的联合创始人彼得·蒂耶（Peter Thiel）曾经指出的那样 ： “ 我们本想要能飞的汽车；谁知却最终收到了140个推特字符 。 ”	It certainly didn’t resolve the big problems, such as eradicating poverty or enabling us to reach Mars. As PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel once noted: “We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.”
是的，我们的政府的主要职责是保护我们；但每时每刻都有人死去，并且死因通常不公正；对于我们追求或可以追求多大程度保护的界线也不清晰。	Yes, our government’s primary job is to protect us; but people die all the time, often unfairly, and there are limits on how much protection we seek or even allow.
考虑到几个重要政府对投票抱有顽固的批评立场，以及若干成员国内部抗议和欧洲怀疑主义党派的势力陡增，将要进行的谈判面临着巨大的困难。	These negotiations will be much harder in view of the spectacular repudiation of a number of key governments at the ballot box, together with the potent rise of protest and Euroskeptic parties in several member states.
欧洲国家放弃繁荣的发展方式，依仗追求理论化的观点，并且这些观点脱离了国际视角，这样做对欧洲而言真的是理智的吗？	But they should not be alone. Is it reasonable that Europe’s countries give up a niche of prosperity on ideological grounds that are irrelevant from a global perspective?
如果人民银行现在只是进一步拉平不受其干预约束的卖出价，那么它就是在进一步靠近完全基于市场的汇率机制。	If the PBOC is now simply moving closer to averaging the offer prices that are not subject to its interference, it is moving closer to an entirely market-based exchange-rate regime.
诚然，一些新兴市场企业累积的美元计价外债数量令人担忧，但许多外国央行拥有充足的美元资产，特别是亚洲。	Although it is true that several emerging-market firms have piled up worrisome quantities of dollar-denominated external debt, many foreign central banks are brimming with dollar assets, especially in Asia.
知道目前，美国人通过从轻易受到影响的外国人那里廉价借钱并且把钱投资于高回报的外国资产、土地以及债券而攫取利润。	Until now, Americans have been raking in profits by borrowing cheaply from pliant foreigners and investing the money in high-yield foreign equities, land, and bonds.
蒸汽机或老式汽车的工作原理一目了然，而现代的汽车飞机如此复杂，以至于这些高科技产品的操纵者对其实际工作���理毫无概念。	In contrast to a steam engine or an old-fashioned automobile, whose operations were easily comprehensible, modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their operators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works.
虽然各国的尤其是在欧洲的众多分析家们已经得出结论，认为这类事件在可预见的将来不可能发生，但印度却是个例外。	While many analysts in a wide variety of nations, especially in Europe, have concluded that such an event could not occur there in the foreseeable future, India is an exception.
伊朗可以把公布伊朗人经常引用但是从来没有被人看见的关键文件作为一个良好的开端－例如，据传规定伊斯兰教禁止从事核武器的生产、储存和使用的阿亚图拉·哈梅内伊的裁定？	A good start would be to publish key documents that are constantly referred to by Iranians but never seen – say, Ayatollah Khamenei’s fatwa that reportedly rules that Islam prohibits the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons?
其新成立的全球基础设施便利（Global Infrastructure Facility，GIF）将动员全球退休基金和主权财富基金投资作为具体资产类别的基础设施。	Its new Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) will mobilize global pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in infrastructure as a specific asset class.
发自伦敦 — — 法国作家莫里哀的古典主义喜剧《伪君子》告诉我们，正是放任骄傲 — — 而非诉诸理性 — — 决定了一个人的行为无可避免地以糟糕收场。	LONDON – In his classic comedy “Tartuffe, or The Impostor,” Molière shows that allowing pride, rather than reason, to dictate one’s actions invariably ends badly.
无论如何，把经过基因改造的运动员贬斥为突变异种或非人类在道德上站不住脚，因为它引发了与其它生物特征，尤其是种族、性别和残疾相联系的同样的偏见，而我们对这些偏见理应深恶痛绝。	In any case, to describe genetically modified athletes as mutants or inhuman is morally suspect, for it invokes the same kind of prejudice that we deplore in relation to other biological characteristics, particularly race, gender, and disability.
华盛顿—拉马福萨（Cyril Ramaphosa）在12月的南非执政党非国大党领导人竞争中胜出，这是总统祖玛遭到否定的明确标志。	WASHINGTON, DC – Cyril Ramaphosa’s victory in December’s contest to lead South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) was a resounding repudiation of President Jacob Zuma.
这些和其他许多例子表明，如果政府能提供多样化的、相对具体的、与时俱进的正确的公共品组合，企业可以变得更加高效。	As these and many other examples show, business can become more efficient if governments provide the right combination of a diverse, relatively specific, and evolving set of public goods.
研究人员推测大约5，000年前，人类首次在非洲感染结核病，而后这种疾病迅速沿着贸易路线传播到全球几乎每一个角落。	Researchers theorize that humans first acquired TB in Africa about 5,000 years ago, and that the disease then swiftly spread along trade routes to nearly every corner of the globe.
与此同时这些妥协方案和所有财务报表或者女式泳衣有着同样的特质：那就是它们试图掩盖的部分才是最精彩的地方。	But those compromises are like statistics or skimpy swimsuits: what they show is less important than what they hide.
Spitfire战机飞行员被披头士、滚石、奇想等有力的自由象征所取代，他们的音乐如同一股清风横扫欧洲和美国。	Spitfire pilots were replaced as vigorous symbols of liberty by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Kinks, whose music swept across Europe and the United States like a gust of fresh air.
这些行为之所以有问题，原因在于它阻碍了资金的有效流动。 同样，外国政府也可以用同样的方式来对付非本国的银行。	Such actions are problematic not only because they insulate inefficient forms of production, but also because foreign countries respond by adopting similar measures towards their national champions, so that everyone is worse off.
这部“推土机”已经成为大多数以色列人的祖父，和西方外交的最后一张牌—对于意料之外的美国人和意料之中的欧洲人都是如此。	The “bulldozer” had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy, for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans, too.
《华盛顿邮报》媒体专栏玛格丽特·苏利文（Margaret Sullivan）最近观察道，对美国总统特朗普的报道狭隘地聚焦于他的用词，却忽视了他的政策。	As the Washington Post’s media columnist Margaret Sullivan recently observed, coverage of US President Donald Trump has focused narrowly on his words, at the expense of his policy.
我们的发病大部分是随机的，即使我们的医生无法告诉我们未来几年我们会得什么病，或者无法在我们得病时消除我们的所有痛苦，但我们仍乐于接受他们所能提供的帮助。	Our maladies are largely random, and even if our doctors cannot tell us which ones we will have in the next year, or eliminate all of our suffering when we have them, we are happy for the help that they can provide.
但日本的经济前沿绝不仅限于亚洲合伙太平洋，而是要延伸到拉丁美洲和非洲，因此，我们更应该抛弃长期以来的内向角度。	But Japan’s economic frontiers extend well beyond Asia and the Pacific, to Latin America and Africa – more reason to abandon our long-held inward-looking perspective.
一战后，国际社会实施了所谓的《毒气协议 》 （ Gas Protocol ） ， 禁止使用化学武器和生物武器。	After World War I, the international community adopted the so-called Gas Protocol, to prohibit the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons.
这一观点认为，如果不存在可让渡的生产性资料个人所有权，就无法找到充分的激励追求发展政策，而共同资源 （ “ 共有物 ” ） 将被过度利用和低效使用。	Absent alienable individual ownership of productive resources, it is asserted, there will be insufficient means and incentives to pursue development initiatives, and shared resources (the “commons”) will be over-exploited and used inefficiently.
澳大利亚、新西兰和加拿大分别为27 % 、 28 % 、 和20 % ， 这部分要归因于这些国家积极的移民政策。	In Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, it is 27%, 28%, and 20%, respectively, a consequence in part of these countries’ activist immigration policies.
在这一点上，卡钦斯基正在模仿他的偶像，两次世界大战之间的波兰领袖约瑟夫·毕苏斯基（尽管这位“波兰第一元帅”确实曾经两次担任总理 ） 。	In this, Kaczyński is emulating his idol, the interwar leader Józef Piłsudski (though the “First Marshal of Poland” did go on to serve as prime minister twice).
正如英格兰银行马克·卡尼（Mark Carney，我猜他也听了默多克的演讲）在今年早些时候所言 ， “ （未经）深思熟虑的市场原教旨主义可能毁灭对资本主义本身的长期活力至关重要的社会资本 。 ”	As the Bank of England’s Governor Mark Carney (who I assume also heard Murdoch’s lecture) remarked earlier this year, “[U]nchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself.”
当前经济状况的逻辑意味着政府应该利用超低利率的时机来投资于可以刺激需求和改善经济结构的基础设施项目。	The logic of current economic conditions implies that governments should be taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to invest in infrastructure projects, which would both stimulate demand and improve the structure of the economy.
毕竟，他将向穆勒的检察官们提供与弗拉基米尔·普京总统关系密切的某些俄罗斯寡头的罪证 — — 这些人对敢于背叛他们的人从不特别温和。	After all, he would be giving Mueller’s prosecutors the goods on some Russian oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin – folks who are not particularly gentle toward people who betray them.
感染了牛海绵状脑病却没有明显症状的个体对其它人构成了威胁，有可能通过输血或手术造成变异型克雅氏病的二次传染。	Individuals infected with BSE who remain in an asymptomatic state during their lives could represent a risk to others of potential secondary transmission of variant CJD through blood transfusion or surgery.
这一方法帮助许多世界级超级企业崛起，也给劳动力市场和社会带来了严重问题，因为它摧毁基于旧技能的中层岗位的速度快于基于新技能的同等岗位的创造速度。	As this approach facilitates the rise of global super-firms, it creates serious problems for labor markets and societies, because it destroys mid-level jobs based on old skills faster than comparable jobs based on new skills can be created.
此外，随着发达经济体竞争力日益提高，以及中国在价值链中地位的攀升，更多的投入品需要在各国国内就地解决。	And, as advanced economies become more competitive, and as China moves up the value chain, more inputs are being sourced within countries.
她还援引了印度教与自然世界的深刻联系来说明“河流崇拜，山丘崇拜，树木崇拜”是“印度的文化遗产 ” 。	“River worship, mountain worship, tree worship,” she said, invoking Hinduism’s deep connections to the natural world, “is India’s cultural heritage.”
疲软的增长已经降至2 % （ 在2010年有过短暂的反弹 ） ， 产出出现大规模负缺口，这表明总就业情况的恢复将非常缓慢，在这种情况下，各国仍采取了收紧财政政策。	Fiscal policy was being tightened when growth was languishing below 2% (after bouncing back in 2010), and sizeable negative output gaps suggested that overall employment would be slow to recover.
如果特朗普真的关注国家安全，那么令人奇怪的是，美国为什么不将地下矿石指定为抵抗未来敌对行动的战略储备。	If Trump really is concerned about national security, then one wonders why the US is not keeping ore in the ground as a strategic reserve for future hostilities.
更加多元化的马哈拉施特拉邦的奥兰加巴德（Aurangabad）城市集群是不少印度最大的种子公司的所在地，拥有活跃的汽车、制药和糖生产行业，同时也是旅游枢纽，坐落着阿旃陀（Ajanta）和艾洛拉（Ellora）石窟。	The more diversified Aurangabad cluster, in Maharashtra, is home to some of India’s largest seed companies, an active automotive, pharmaceutical, and sugar-manufacturing industry, and a tourism hub that includes the Ajanta and Ellora caves.
相反，美国容许在以色列政府缺乏任何行动的情况下出现一个政治真空，而如今这个真空就被“阿拉伯觉醒”所填补了。	Instead, the US allowed a political vacuum to form in the absence of any movement on the part of Israel’s government. This vacuum has now been filled by the Arab Awakening.
但鉴于包括共同文化或环境 — — 或随机因素 （ “ 基因漂变 ” ） 在内的多重原因均可造成某种特质随时间推移发生可以衡量的变化，因此证明这种现象的研究非常罕见。	But, given that measurable alterations in a trait over time can occur for many reasons – including those related to shared culture or environment – or randomly (“genetic drift”), studies demonstrating this phenomenon are rare.
不仅他是如此：在每一个伟大的帝国背后，都有一位伟大的哲学家和历史学家，他的世界观推动帝国带着合法性甚至神圣性前进。	And he was not unique: behind every great empire has been a great philosopher or historian whose worldview imbued the imperial drive with legitimacy and even sacred significance.
这将导致英国国会中支持脱欧的英国独立党的兄弟党派五星运动（Five Star Movement）上台掌权。	That could bring to power the Five Star Movement, a partner of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party in the European Parliament.
这些新技术实现了个人赋权 — — 特别是给快速增长的年轻人口 — — 也让经济和社会发展走上了康庄大道。	These new technologies empower people – most notably the rapidly growing youth population – and create new avenues for economic and social development.
成功需要每年投入6,000亿美元，涉及到的领域包括环境修复和保护、可再生能源和能源效率，以及可持续交通系统。	Success will require an estimated $600 billion in investment each year, in areas including environmental remediation and protection, renewable energies and energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation systems.
从1985到1995年雅克·德洛尔任委员会主席以来，再也没有有远见或政治影响力的领袖担任过委员会主席职务。	Not since Jacques Delors was President of the Commission, from 1985 to 1995, has that position been filled by a leader with any vision or political clout.
黎巴嫩潜在的碳氢化合物财富的确可以协助这个国家完成转型，同时为中东其他能源生产国提供一种模式用于参照。	Lebanon’s potential hydrocarbon wealth could indeed transform the country, as well as providing a model for other Middle Eastern energy producers to follow.
如果唯一的结果是降低其外交政策的可靠性和可预见性 — — 甚至更糟，招致别人的误解 — — 那么答案当然是不需要。	If the outcome is to make its foreign policy less reliable and predictable – or, worse, susceptible to misunderstanding – then it certainly does not.
左翼意识形态（特别是在英国）更多地来源于某些基督教道德传统 （ “ 比马克思更加卫理公会 ” ） 而非任何政治教条。	Left-wing ideology, especially in Britain, owed more to certain Christian moral traditions (“more Methodist than Marx”) than to any political dogma.
但仍有八个国家没有签署全面禁止核试验条约，这使该条约无法产生效力，其对全球安全的作用也没有纳入核安全峰会的日程。	Yet the failure of eight countries to ratify the CTBT has prevented it from entering into force, and its contribution to global security has so far not been included on the NSS agenda.
奥斯汀，德克萨斯—四百年前，约翰·罗尔夫（John Rolfe）用从西印度群岛偷来的烟草种子发展出弗吉尼亚州第一宗盈利的出口生意，扰乱了西班牙加勒比海殖民地的烟草贸易。	AUSTIN, TEXAS – Four hundred years ago, John Rolfe used tobacco seeds pilfered from the West Indies to develop Virginia’s first profitable export, undermining the tobacco trade of Spain’s Caribbean colonies.
同样，阵亡抚恤金仅仅是50万美元，大大低于死亡的一生全部经济成本的标准估计。 有时也把它称作生命的统计学价值（在610万美元到650万美元之间 ） 。	Similarly, payments for those who are killed amount to only $500,000, which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death, sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ($6.1 to $6.5 million).
美国和其他很多发达国家的模式则恰好相反，随着其国内生产及出口资本密集度的提升，他们的经常账户余额均出现了恶化。	This pattern contrasts with that of the United States and many other advanced countries, which have experienced a deterioration of their current-account balances as their production and exports have become more capital-intensive.
但美国回归亚洲中心舞台的风光面临着中国战略雄心的制约，其充当亚洲主要安全锚所要面对着诸多关键性的挑战。	But the heady glow of America’s return to center stage in Asia has obscured key challenges in remaining the region’s principal security anchor in the face of China’s strategic ambitions.
真相是传统西方列强尽管有诸多共同点，但在许多方面仍然是多样化的，从能源政策 — — 欧洲碳氢化合物依赖远大于美国 — — 到安全莫不如此。	The truth is that the traditional Western powers, despite having plenty in common, diverge in many areas, from energy policy – Europe is far more dependent on hydrocarbons than the US – to security.
在邻国也门陷入一场代理战争僵局的沙特人高兴地看到特朗普正在考虑增加援助来驱逐伊朗侵占其战略后院的行动。	The Saudis, bogged down in a proxy war with Iran in neighboring Yemen, are elated that Trump is contemplating an increase in assistance to repel Iranian encroachment from their strategic backyard.
意大利和西班牙等传统天主教欧洲国家有自由堕胎法，但拉丁美洲仍保留着最虔诚的信仰，保持着这个世界最严格的法律禁忌。	While traditionally Roman Catholic European countries like Italy and Spain have liberalized their abortion laws, Latin America has remained true to the faith, maintaining some of the world’s strictest legal prohibitions.
伦敦 — — 马琳·勒庞，法国极右翼国家阵线领袖声称爱国主义和全球主义之战将成为21世纪一场决定性的战争。	LONDON – Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Front, claims that the twenty-first century’s defining battle will be between patriotism and globalism.
而欧盟则提供这一套共同规则，通过共同的机构，让每一个国家 — — 即使是最小的 — — 都能有发言权。	The EU provides this set of common rules, buttressed by common institutions that give every country, even the smallest, a say.
但那些刚刚遭遇房价泡沫爆破的国家则不太会产生另一场房价泡沫,因为趋向保守的政府政策可能会减少对住房的补贴，而这些国家当前的市场气氛似乎也无法催生泡沫。	But another housing bubble is not imminent in countries where one just burst. Conservative government policies will probably reduce subsidies to housing, and the current mood in these markets does not seem conducive to a bubble.
士气低落的问题缺乏善意和体面；这是习俗和礼仪的失败，是社会目标的缺失，是辨别对错以采取正确行动的能力或意愿的减弱。	Low morale results from too little kindness and decency; it is a failure of custom and manners, a loss of social purpose, a diminution of the ability or the will to distinguish right from wrong and then to act rightly.
再回到我们先前的类比，街头的帮派不能攫取政治权力，但他们肯定能将使所在的街区置于危险、落后和可怕的状态。	To return to the analogy, urban street gangs cannot seize political power, but they can certainly keep their neighborhoods dangerous, backward, and grim.
丰裕家庭花费收入和财富的比例较低，因此，不平等性的升高会带来总体消费水平的降低，从而制约已不堪总需求不足重负的经济复苏。	Given that affluent households spend a smaller share of their incomes and wealth, greater inequality translates into lower overall consumption, thereby hindering the recovery of economies already burdened by inadequate aggregate demand.
安卡拉—如果我们真的生活在“地球村”中，通过商业、金融和社会联系彼此，那么某地非正式经济活动就真的会对其他地方产生消极影响。	ANKARA – If it is true that we live in a “global village,” bound to one another through commercial, financial, and social ties, then it is also true that informal economic activity in one part of the world has a negative impact elsewhere.
相对1995—2007年趋势的累计产出损失，目前美国为GDP的78 % ， 欧元区为GDP的60 % 。	Cumulative output losses relative to the 1995-2007 trends now stand at 78% of annual GDP for the US, and at 60% for the eurozone.
他是产业政策的坚定鼓吹者，这将会让他与欧盟委员会和其他许多领导人产生巨大的对立。 他还深深地不信任金融市场，还经常主张更多的监管。	He is a staunch advocate of industrial policies, which will lead him into sharp confrontation with the European Commission and many of his colleagues.
其实有玩笑认为默克尔会像战后德国首任领袖康拉德·阿登纳一样终身担任总理职务（德国并没有设立任期限制 ） 。	Indeed, as with postwar Germany’s first leader, Konrad Adenauer, there are jokes about Merkel being Chancellor for life (Germany has no term limits).
通常发生的情况是，新闻圈根据先入为主地认定观众和读者喜欢什么，而不是根据他们实际喜欢什么来采取行动。	Very often, the news cycle is driven by assumptions about what viewers or readers might like, rather than what they actually want.
让作为税收替代的能源税尤其作为防务措施具有吸引力的地方是，它在让欧洲更为安全、环保而且富有的同时保持福利国家毫发无损。	What makes the energy imposed as a tax substitution tax particularly attractive as a defense measure is that it leaves the welfare state intact while making Europe safer, greener, and richer.
这一决定在法国（包括���社会主义者之间）仍有争议，但奥朗德很明白，以欧洲防务政策之孱弱是断然无法与北约抗衡的。	That decision remains controversial in France, including among Socialists, but Hollande is well aware of the weaknesses of a European defense policy that simply cannot compete with NATO.
这意味着官方增长率没有反映与空调、抗癌药物、新手术流程以及其他许多普通创新一起到来的真实收入的提高。	That means that the official growth rate does not reflect the rise in real incomes that came with air conditioning, anti-cancer drugs, new surgical procedures, and the many more mundane innovations.
摩根大通首席财务官玛丽安妮·莱克（Marianne Lake）表示，这笔罚款中有大约70亿美元可以适用于税收扣减，也就是说，被当作必要的常规经营费用处理。	Marianne Lake, JP Morgan’s chief financial officer, has suggested that about $7 billion of the fine is likely to be tax deductible, that is, treated as a form of necessary and usual business expense.
此外，69%的人认为美国在阿富汗战争后面临的恐怖主义威胁并未减弱，而71%的人表示伊拉克的经验表明美国应该更加谨慎地使用武力。	Moreover, 69% do not believe that the US is safer from terrorism since the war in Afghanistan, and 71% say that the experience in Iraq shows that the US should take greater care in how it uses force.
既然有这些新科技，生产率也即将大幅度提高，为何还有这么多人继续认为所有人都必须更多地工作、更晚地退出才能让经济保持竞争力？	Why, with all this new technology and imminent productivity increases, do so many continue to argue that everyone has to work more and retire much later in life if economies are to remain competitive?
土耳其对伊拉克北部地区实施的有限的军事打击除开会使伊拉克当局作出公开谴责和口头宣称伊拉克的主权外，不会再引起其他反应。	A limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty.
与列宁恶化社会条件将加速革命的信条如出一辙，Hojatieh认为，暴力、冲突和压迫升级将促成马赫迪的归来。	Akin in some ways to Lenin’s doctrine that worsening social conditions would hasten revolution, the Hojatieh believe that only increased violence, conflict, and oppression will bring the Mahdi’s return.
评论员苏利文（Andrew Sullivan）说 ： “ 我看到了我第一眼看到的那个人 … … 我看到了我自以为了解的总统 。 ”	As the commentator Andrew Sullivan put it, “I saw the person I first saw...I saw the president I thought I knew.”
第二天，他的这番话被广泛报道；但听众的行为只字未提，让读者产生了首相完全是主动向日本公民爆粗口的印象。	The next day, his words were reported widely; the behavior of the crowd, however, was not, leaving readers with the impression that their prime minister had, completely unprompted, yelled coarsely at Japanese citizens.
大多数人需要一个社会定义，但将这一定义依附在一座城市之上显然要比依附在一个全副武装并打算与敌人发生冲突的国家身上更好。	Most people need a communal identity, but it may well be better to find it in one’s attachment to a city than in attachment to a country that is armed and willing to engage in conflict with enemies.
因此，个性化用药的影响从短期看有利于病患方，但用大量临床试验来证明新药的安全性将给制药方带来巨大的开发成本。	Thus, the impact of personalized medicine in the short term might be positive at the patient’s bedside, but vast clinical trials to demonstrate the safety of new drugs will impose huge development costs that manufacturers might never recover.
为什么神经学家、分子生物学家、遗传学家和发展生物学家—这些以科研成果永久地改变了我们对自身的认识的男性和女性—对他们的未来却如此彷徨不安？	Why are neuroscientists, molecular biologists, geneticists, and developmental biologists – men and women whose discoveries have forever changed the way we understand ourselves – so uneasy about their futures?
若将新鲜食物剔除出物价指数，则通胀率将升至0.9 % ， 但若将能源剔除，通胀率将降至0.3 % 。	When fresh food is excluded from the price index, the rate rises to 0.9%, but falls to 0.3% when also excluding energy.
在“地球中心的王国”衰落了几个世纪之后，正在骄傲地崛起，恢复它曾经拥有的辉煌。 与此同时，俄罗斯也在跃跃欲试地企图恢复从前的帝国地位，但这似乎注定不会成功。	Whereas the “Middle Kingdom” is proudly regaining its former global status after centuries of decline, Russia is defiantly trying to resurrect its former imperial status, but in a manner that appears doomed to fail.
广义上说，租金作为一种收入形式，完全来源于对资产的所有权和控制权，而不是对经济资源的创新和创业型部署。	Rent, broadly defined, is income derived solely from the ownership and control of an asset, rather than from innovative, entrepreneurial deployments of economic resources.
EITC也获得了广泛的支持（在美国经济学会进行的调查中，四分之三的受访经济学家支持扩大EITC ） 。	The EITC also has broad backing (more than three-quarters of economists surveyed by the American Economic Association support expanding it).
建立欧洲“银行联盟”需要德国的首肯。 银行联盟意味着向欧洲央行让渡监督权，并建立一个清算倒闭银行的共同基金。	Germany’s consent was needed to create Europe’s “banking union,” which entailed the transfer of supervisory powers to the European Central Bank and the creation of a common fund to resolve failing banks.
虽然有一些多边发展银行和开发融资机构融资可被用于早期基础设施投资 — — 包括中国的丝路基金，世界银行以及联合国国际金融公司 — — 但这类融资的供应却受到了需求不足的拖累。	Although some MDB and DFI financing is available for early-stage infrastructure investment – including from China’s Silk Road Fund, the World Bank, and the International Finance Corporation – the supply of such financing is dwarfed by demand.
在这样的情形下，经济将逐渐疲软，使皇室难以继续收买中产阶级支持，让东部和南部的反对派有能力打击政府的权威。	In such a scenario, the economy would gradually weaken, hampering the royal family’s ability to continue buying middle-class support, while enabling rebel groups in the east and the south to erode the government’s authority.
当然，如果历史能够提供任何借鉴，那么我们可以了解实现从国家统治到执行监管的转变是一个十分困难的过程。	Of course, if history is any indication, the shift from a dirigiste state to a regulatory one will not be easy.
各种各样的性别歧视让女性处于性奴役、人口买卖、包办婚姻的风险之下，剥夺了女性不可侵犯的权利，也破坏了生命的平等性。	In all of its forms, gender discrimination makes women vulnerable to sexual slavery, trafficking, and forced marriage, deprives women of their inalienable rights, and diminishes their quality of life.
事实上，特朗普的煽动及不停谴责媒体是“人民公敌”的模式已经令很多人深信其追随者有可能针对新闻媒体从业人员发起暴力行动。	In fact, Trump’s pattern of incitement and routine denunciations of the media as “the enemy of the people” had convinced many that some of his followers might resort to violence against members of the press.
在几乎所有努力折戟沉沙之后，国际外交已经越来越多地被有关制裁的探讨所取代 — — 人们热衷于讨论如何运用制裁和谈判两种方式来迫使伊朗就范。	With just about every diplomatic effort failing to yield results, international efforts have increasingly given way to discussions about sanctions – and what mix of them would be needed to bring Iran to heel.
如今学生债务存量高达1.2万亿美元，其中超过60%由收入最低的四分之一家庭（即净财富少于8,500美元的家庭）承担	It now stands at well over $1.2 trillion, more than 60% of which is held by the bottom quartile of households (those with a net worth of less than $8,500).
出人意料的是，低三种选择的修正版 — — 104名巴勒斯坦囚犯将在谈判的各阶段被释放 — — 最终促成了谈判重启。	Unexpectedly, a modified version of the third option – whereby 104 Palestinian prisoners will be released in phases over the course of the negotiations – ultimately facilitated the resumption of talks.
然而讽刺地是，刚掌权的民主反对派却想恢复Burma这个名字，因为他们视Myanmar这一名字为独裁的象征 — — 而这正是他们想摒弃的东西。	Ironically, however, the newly empowered democratic opposition would like to bring back the name Burma, viewing “Myanmar” as emblematic of the dictatorship that they wish to leave behind.
这出剧写于欧洲三十年战争期间。 这场十七世纪上半叶的战争摧毁了欧洲，直到1648年签订威斯特伐利亚和约（Peace of Westphalia）才宣告结束。	The play is set during Europe’s Thirty Years’ War, which devastated Europe in the first half of the seventeenth century, ending only with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.
甚至有观点认为同性恋因为“非自然”所以是错误的，甚至是“对我们性能力的扭曲 ” ， 而性能力按理只能为生育的目的而存在。	Sometimes it is claimed that homosexuality is wrong because it is “unnatural,” and even a “perversion of our sexual capacity,” which supposedly exists for the purpose of reproduction.
印度的耻辱溃败加速了其总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁（Jawaharlal Nehru）的死亡，但它也促进了这个国家的军事现代化和政治崛起。	India’s humiliating rout hastened the death of its prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru; but it also set in motion the country’s military modernization and political rise.
每当上一代统治者兑现掌权的非法收益，都会引发继任者更为强烈的掠夺欲望，他们害怕轮到自己掌权时利益已经被瓜分殆尽。	As each preceding generation of rulers cashes in its illicit gains from holding power, the successors are motivated by both the desire to loot even more and the fear that there may not be much left by the time they get their turn at the trough.
纽黑文—美联储试图退出其非常规货币政策，这一政策面临着一对矛盾：它成功地阻止了经济灾难，但没能铸就强健的经济复苏。	NEW HAVEN – As the US Federal Reserve attempts to exit from its unconventional monetary policy, it is grappling with the disparity between the policy’s success in preventing economic disaster and its failure to foster a robust recovery.
例如，纳西姆·尼古拉斯·塔勒布（Nassim Nicholas Taleb）在他2004年出版的书《被随机性愚弄的傻瓜》中提到经济科学 ： “ 你可以用方程式来掩盖自己的把戏，没有人能够揭穿你，因为没有东西可以进行对照实验。	For example, in his 2004 book Fooled by Randomness, Nassim Nicholas Taleb said of economic sciences: “You can disguise charlatanism under the weight of equations, and nobody can catch you since there is no such thing as a controlled experiment.”
伦敦 — — 35年前，作为全球考察的一部分，查尔斯·伯顿和我途经北极穿越北冰洋，之后在一块快速移动的冰盖上露营了三个月。	LONDON – Thirty-five years ago, as part of a global expedition, Charles Burton and I traveled across the Arctic Ocean via the North Pole, camping for three months on a fast-moving ice floe.
总之，中国必须将重点从实现GDP增长目标转向营造促进创新与竞争的环境，从而允许市场制定价格并提高资源分配效率。	In short, China must shift its focus from meeting GDP growth targets to creating an environment that fosters innovation and competition, thereby enabling market forces to set prices and allocate resources more effectively.
但这也无法确保塔利班会动用武力阻止他们的基地组织盟友在阿富汗境内重组武装力量，并利用这些力量对其他国家发动新一轮恐怖袭击。	But it is hard to imagine the Taliban using force to prevent their al-Qaeda allies from reestablishing a military presence in Afghanistan and exploiting that presence to organize additional terrorist attacks in other countries.
但消灭无法使用且维护价格昂贵的核武器是很容易实现的目标 — — 是我们能够轻松把握和消除的风险因素。	But nuclear weapons, unusable and extremely expensive to maintain, are low-hanging fruit – a risk that we can easily grasp and eliminate.
除此之外，在北方邦旅游部门发行的本地主要旅游景点手册也将泰姬陵这个该州（以及该国）的主要旅游目的地排除在外。	Furthering this erasure, the Uttar Pradesh tourism department issued a brochure of the state’s main attractions, but left out the Taj Mahal, the state’s (and the country’s) main tourism destination.
在特朗普总统任期第一年与朝鲜独裁者相互辱骂时，那个国家的核计划已经稳步向前推进，而美国也距离违背所有人意愿的战争越来越近。	While the president spent his first year in office trading insults with the dictator of North Korea, that country has moved steadily forward with its nuclear program, and the United States has moved steadily closer to a war that no one wants.
特朗普政府最近公布了一份十年预算计划，被批缺少连贯性，也没有给出明确的税收政策。 这样的批评非常中肯。	The administration recently released a ten-year budget plan that has been rightly criticized for its lack of coherence and its failure to describe explicit tax policies.
此外，有些国家的政府债务负担同欧洲边缘国家的债务负担一样大，甚至更大，美国和日本就是两个最好的例子。	Moreover, there are countries with government-debt burdens that are as large, if not larger, than those on Europe’s periphery – the United States and Japan being prime examples.
这一计划意味着克里姆林宫将为卡德罗夫 — — 开始是艾哈迈德·卡德罗夫，在他死后，便是他的儿子，拉姆赞·卡德罗夫 — — 提供广泛的自治权力（但不能名义独立）和巨额资金。	The plan implied that the Kremlin would provide the Kadyrovs – first Akhmad Kadyrov, and then, after his death, his son, Ramzan – broad autonomy (independence in all but name) and huge sums of money.
发达和贫穷国家都有大量例子，不负责任的盈利性学校糊弄家长、忽视学生（唐纳德·特朗普的伪善的特朗普大学就是其中之一 ） 。	There are abundant examples, in rich and poor countries alike, of fly-by-night for-profit schools that dupe parents and neglect students (Donald Trump’s sham Trump University being a case in point).
由于气候变化的影响，非洲正在经历1945年来最严重的干旱，尤其是在南苏丹、索马里、埃塞俄比亚和北尼日利亚等地区。	Owing to the effects of climate change, Africa is experiencing its worst drought since 1945, especially in Southern Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Northern Nigeria.
文化的“零点”是重要的，因为它们构成了一条分割线 — — 泾渭分明的“之前”和“之后 ” — —给私人和公共生活的发展造成了根本性影响。	Cultural “zero points” are important because they serve as a dividing line – a clear demarcation of “before” and “after” that holds fundamental implications for the development of private and public life.
某些经济学家，包括我本人在内，的确警告过在现有的管理、稳定及合法化市场制度的边界以外推进经济全球化的后果。	Some economists, including me, did warn about the consequences of pushing economic globalization beyond the boundaries of institutions that regulate, stabilize, and legitimize markets.
已经有证据表明，女记者开始自我审查，不再撰写某些问题的报道，特别是基于权利的问题和影响到边缘群体的问题。	Already there is evidence that women are self-censoring and drawing back from writing about certain issues, specifically rights-based issues and those affecting marginalized communities.
美国总统特朗普去年夏天在勃兰特下跪的纪念碑前发表了演讲，受到了波兰公众的热烈响应，原因就在于他没有偏离PiS所认可的叙事。	US President Donald Trump’s speech in Warsaw last summer was well received by the Polish public precisely because he did not deviate from the PiS-endorsed narrative.
科罗拉多大学波尔德分校（University of Colorado, Boulder）的凯西·费斯勒（Casey Fiesler）正在探索这一试验方法，他将以科技伦理为主题的课程大纲进行众包。	Casey Fiesler of the University of Colorado, Boulder, is pursuing just such experimentation by crowd-sourcing syllabi focused on tech ethics.
然而，即使是来自联合国的最悲观的预测也预期发展中国家的普通民众在2100年时会比现在更富裕，也因此能更好的应对这一挑战。	However, by 2100, even the most pessimistic forecasts from the UN expect the average person in the developing countries to be richer than now, and thus better able to cope.
阿亚图拉Mesbah Yazdi频频与艾哈迈迪内贾德一同在公开场合露面，他负责Hojatieh学会，许多什叶派将该学会视为极端分子。	Led by Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, who frequently appears with the Ahmadinejad, the Hojatieh society is considered by many Shia as the lunatic fringe.
为了保护欧洲公司从哈瓦那酒店中赚取的利润，欧盟将会停止邀请思想开放的人士来到使馆，并会按照独裁者及其附庸们的脸色来判断他们究竟是什么人。	To protect European corporations’ profits from their Havana hotels, the Union will cease inviting open-minded people to EU embassies, and we will deduce who they are from the expression on the face of the dictator and his associates.
而用超宽松货币政策来抵消财政紧缩又要冒风险 — — 在发达国家这意味着私人杠杆卷土重来，而在新兴经济体已经出现危险的杠杆上升溢出状况了。	But offsetting fiscal austerity with ultra-easy monetary policies risks fueling a resurgence of private leverage in advanced economies and already has produced the dangerous spillover of rising leverage in emerging economies.
RIGA — — 欧盟委员会不帮助所有欧盟成员国实现各自的《京都议定书》目标，反而将本应共同分担的责任推到最新成员国头上。	RIGA -- Instead of helping all EU member states to meet their own Kyoto goals, the European Commission is shifting what should be a shared burden onto its newest members, which are already the most environmentally efficient in the European Union.
显然，诗人兼哲学家保罗·瓦勒里（Paul Valéry）是正确的 ： “ 未来和其他所有东西一样，不再会与昨日相同 。 ”	Clearly, the poet and philosopher Paul Valéry was right: “The future, like everything else, is no longer what it used to be.”
但是，对大部分健康男性来说，美国预防服务专职小组（USPSTF ） — —由预防和初级治疗专家组成的独立领导小组 — — 公开反对普及PSA测试。	For most healthy men, however, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) – a leading independent panel of experts on prevention and primary care – has publicly recommended against widespread PSA tests.
潘基文还可以表明在当今世界恐怖主义的存在是没有正当理由的，这里的恐怖行动指的是国际上为了政治意图而对平民故意造成伤害的行为。	Ban can also make the case that there is no justification in today’s world for terror – defined here as the intentional harming of civilians for political purposes.
在共产党执政的最后几周里，马佐维耶茨基推动建立了谈判实现政治过渡的模式，这种模式直到今天依然为巨变中的其他社会提供信息、指引和激励。	In the final weeks of Communist rule, Mazowiecki helped to establish a model for negotiated political transition that still informs, inspires, and guides other societies on the cusp of change.
此外目前美国玉米产量的40%都已经用作提炼乙醇，而几年前这一比例还仅有5%左右，这意味着玉米价格必须提高以应对市场对食品，出口和乙醇生产的需求。	In addition, the fact that nearly 40% of the US corn crop is being used for ethanol, up from around 5% a few years ago, means that corn prices must be higher to meet the feed, export, and ethanol demands for corn.
在凡尔赛会议上，欧洲四大经济体 — — 德国、法国、意大利和西班牙 — — 支持由它们组成统一的核心的多速方针。	At a meeting at Versailles, the EU’s four largest economies – Germany, France, Italy, and Spain – endorsed a multi-speed approach that would establish them as a unified core.
具体地讲，我们需要同步推进有利于增长的结构性改革、加强需求管理、解决过度负债问题并改善地区和全球政策框架。	What is needed, in particular, is simultaneous progress on pro-growth structural reforms, better demand management, addressing pockets of excessive indebtedness, and improving regional and global policy frameworks.
不幸的是，我的许多同僚 — — 特别是编教科书的那几位 — — 将物理学描绘成一座壮丽无瑕的万丈高楼，却忽视了这个由众多古怪模型所构成的理论大杂烩其实早已千疮百孔。	Unfortunately, many of my colleagues – particularly those who write textbooks – present physics as a towering, seamless basilica, ignoring the gaps in our hodge-podge of skewed models.
选民们因为否决像“跨太平洋伙伴关系 ” （ TPP）这样的新自由贸易协议及重新谈判像北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）这样的已有协议而兴奋不已。	Voters were galvanized by the prospect of rejecting new free-trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and renegotiating old ones like the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
幸运的是，即使布什不明白这些基本准则，美国的法庭却是明白的，虽然它只是马后炮地迫使它的政府遵守这些条例。	Fortunately, even if Bush does not understand such basic principles, America’s courts do, and they are now, albeit belatedly, forcing his administration to abide by them.
这种情况往往预示着（通胀调整后）实际工资的上涨，这表明在脆弱的后危机复苏时代，落后的许多美国工人可能最终从强劲的经济增长中尝到甜头。	Such conditions usually foreshadow rising real (inflation-adjusted) wages, which would indicate that American workers, many of whom were left behind in the anemic post-crisis recovery, might finally reap benefits from the strong economy.
但阿拉伯地区需要的是基于项目的微观导向大手笔治理投资，这必须以商业环境的深度改革为条件，该地区的商业环境被公认为世界最差。	But what the Arab region needs are micro-oriented, project-based, and governance-heavy investments conditioned on deep reform of a business environment that is generally considered among the worst in the world.
为此他呼吁将欧元打造为“一个新的、更具主权意义的欧洲的工具 ” ， 并承诺要“推出一些加强欧元国际作用的举措 ” 。	He then called for the euro to become “the instrument of a new, more sovereign Europe,” and promised to “present initiatives to strengthen the international role of the euro.”

在这个问题上，自安倍经济学的第一支箭射出以来，日本已创造超过270万个工作岗位，并因此取得了重大的成功。	Here, Japan has been tremendously successful, creating more than 2.7 million jobs since the first arrow of Abenomics was launched.
苏丹自身的挑战在于改革整个石油行业，后者多年来遭到中国和马来西亚企业残酷和不负责任的开发，造成了灾难性的环境后果。	Its own challenge lies in reforming the entire oil industry, which for years has been brutally and irresponsibly exploited by Chinese and Malaysian companies, with devastating environmental consequences.
根据维也纳公约第22条 ， “ （外交）使团驻地神圣不可侵犯 ， ” 且“驻地所在东道国不能进入，除非有外交使团首脑允许 。 ”	According to Article 22 of the Convention, “the premises of [a diplomatic] mission shall be inviolable,” and a “receiving state may not enter them, except with the consent of the head of the mission.”

遗憾的是，国际法律和管辖的全球系统还太弱小，如果世界最强大国家的总统决意独自跳起战争，上述体系阻止不了他的一意孤行。	Unfortunately, the global system of international law and governance remains too weak to prevent the determined misbehavior of the president of the world's most powerful country if he is hell bent on starting a war on his own.
即使在后来的两次减税中 — — 1986年里根的第二期财政计划和2001年小布什的减税政策 — — 净国民储蓄率平均也有4.2 % ， 比当前水平高出一倍有余。	Even during the two tax cuts that followed – the second installment of Reagan’s fiscal program in 1986, and the initiatives of George W. Bush in 2001 – the net national saving rate averaged 4.2%, more than double the current level.
目前的全球经济危机是一个机遇，可以让我们进行新的试验，不仅可以解决这一危机，而且或许可以建立某些机制来帮助防止未来的危机。	The current global economic crisis is an opportunity for some new experimentation that might not only lead to its resolution, but might also set in place institutions that help to prevent future crises.
在过去两个世纪中，世界在降低婴儿死亡率方面取得了重大进展，普通妇女不再需要将生命中的五年时间用来怀孕，再将十年时间用来哺乳。	Over the past two centuries, the world has made significant strides in reducing infant mortality, such that the typical woman no longer has to spend five years of her life pregnant and another ten years nursing.
这不仅是对国际法的粗暴违反；也直接有悖于俄罗斯再三强调的任何国家都没有权利牺牲他国保证自身安全的说辞。	This was not only a gross violation of international law; it also directly contravened Russia’s oft-stated insistence that no country has the right to ensure its security at the expense of another.
（特朗普本人也参与了一场在空军一号上举行的会议，当时他正从上任总统后的第二次出访中回国，会议起草了一份掩盖特朗普大厦会晤内容的声明。 ）	(Trump himself participated in a meeting aboard Air Force One, as he returned from his second presidential trip abroad, to draft a statement to cover up what happened in that Trump Tower meeting.)
公共部门和私人部门 — — 单独行动以及大规模、长时间的合作 — — 需要以更严肃的态度思考如何对劳动力的再培训和再武装、增强劳动力流动性、职业培训和实习。	Both the public and private sectors – individually and through scalable and durable partnerships – need to think much more seriously about labor retraining and retooling programs, enhanced labor mobility, vocational training, and internships.
在卢旺达，GBD研究揭示，用固体燃料烹饪造成室内空气污染是主要致死原因，政府据此制定了一个计划，为最脆弱家庭提供了一百万只清洁炉灶。	In Rwanda, when the GBD study revealed that indoor air pollution from cooking with solid fuel was a leading cause of death, the government launched a program to distribute one million clean stoves to the most vulnerable households.

但1997年亚洲金融危机后，收入差距开始在整个地区拉大，印尼尤其严重，社会福利计划对于阻止不平等性的加剧几乎毫无作用。	But, since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, income gaps have widened throughout the region, and in Indonesia in particular, where social welfare programs have barely stemmed the rise in inequality.
佩雷茨的战略可能是从左翼政党争取选民，但是工党几乎肯定会失去中间派别选民（以及那些视国家安全为首要任务的人士）的支持而流向沙龙。	Peretz’s strategy may draw voters from other parties on the left, but Labor will most likely lose centrist voters (and those for whom national security is paramount) to Sharon.
印度尼西亚最近发生了两件戏剧性的释放事件：一是一位激进的穆斯林教士被从监狱里释放了出来，另一件是一份漂亮的男性杂志被投入了市场。	Indonesia recently witnessed a pair of dramatic releases: one a radical Muslim cleric from prison, the other a saucy men’s magazine from its editors.
在暴力驱逐独裁者索莫扎（Anastasio Somaza）后掌权的社会主义革命家，需要借助基督教上帝获得合法性，真实咄咄怪事。	That a socialist revolutionary – who first came to power after violently ousting the dictator Anastasio Somoza – should seek legitimacy in a Christian god is odd.
从20世纪80年代初到21世纪第一个十年中期，沙特阿拉伯一直是泛阿拉伯政坛的协调者，利雅得和吉大的宫殿吸引着整个阿拉伯世界的政治领袖。	From the early 1980’s to the mid-2000’s, Saudi Arabia was the coordinator of pan-Arab politics, with the palaces of Riyadh and Jeddah drawing political leaders from throughout the Arab world.
如果一个旨在促进繁荣和欧洲进一步整合的系统一直都导致了适得其反的效果，那么友好分手就比当前的僵局更好。	A system intended to promote prosperity and further integration has been having just the opposite effect. An amicable divorce would be better than the current stalemate.

他自身的利益，不论是身体还是道德上的，都不足以成为（受到权力约束）的原因 … … 他有权支配自己的身体和思想。	His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant....Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.
对印度和中国而言，基于化石燃料的经济发展轨迹可能会带来灾难，因为其庞大人口的巨额需求可能激化地缘政治紧张。	For India and China, an economic trajectory based on fossil fuels could spell catastrophe, as efforts to secure enough for their immense populations ratchet up geopolitical tensions.
更有甚者，德国央行（Bundesbank）仍然死抱住从德国惨痛的通胀经历中总结出来的过时的货币学说。	To make matters worse, the Bundesbank remains committed to an outmoded monetary doctrine rooted in Germany’s traumatic experience with inflation.
而且在这次争斗同时，美国派遣海豹突击队在深入巴基斯坦境内的一栋建筑中找到本·拉登，而且只在袭击行动结束后才通知了巴基斯坦政府。	And, in the midst of this tussle, the US sent Navy Seals to find Bin Laden at a compound deep in Pakistani territory, informing Pakistan’s government only after the raid was over.
持续60年的残酷镇压甚至都难以让西藏和新疆认同这一点，这从2008年的西藏人和2009年的维吾尔人爆乱中可以得知。	Six decades of ruthless repression has failed to win China acceptance even in Tibet and Xinjiang, as the Tibetan and Uighur revolts of 2008 and 2009 attested.
真相是，是布什 — — 他让美国陷入了阿富汗和伊拉克战争 — — 在2008年签署了部队地位协定（Status of Forces Agreement ） ， 根据该协定，美国要在三年内撤出所有驻伊拉克美军。	The truth is that it was Bush who, having plunged the US into war in Afghanistan and Iraq, in 2008 signed the Status of Forces Agreement that allotted three years to withdraw all US troops from Iraqi territory.
首先是W玻色子和Z玻色子的质量。 W玻色子和Z玻色子是弱相互作用的介质，比如阳光照射就是有它们传递的。	The first was the masses of the W and Z bosons – the messengers of the weak nuclear interactions, responsible, for example, for the shining sun.
北方牧场信托组织帮助牧民群体建立其赖以生存的有效环境治理机制，减少因为放牧权所引发的冲突，尤其是在干旱时期。	NRT has helped pastoralist communities establish effective governance mechanisms for the environment on which they depend, reducing conflict over grazing rights, especially in times of drought.
与一直在将战略“支点”从一个地区转向另一个地区的美国不同，中国正在实施从“国家间政治”向“网络间政治”的再平衡，着重于“连通”而非“控制 ” 。	Unlike the US, which has been engineering a strategic “pivot” from one geographic region to another, China is rebalancing from “politics among nations” to “politics among networks,” focusing on “connectivity” rather than “control.”
美国共和党总统候选人赫尔曼·凯恩的“999”计划呼吁在实行9%的个人及企业税率的同时，实行9%的国家销售税率。	In the US, the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain’s “9-9-9” plan calls for a 9% rate for personal and corporate taxes, together with a new 9% national sales tax.
事实上，这也许来的正是时候 — — 发达经济体人口老龄化意味着未来几十年中劳动力将减少 — — 而个人护理需求将增加。	In fact, this may come just in time – an aging population in developed economies implies a smaller workforce – and greater need for personal care services – in the coming decades.
美国学者约翰·贾沃尔（John Garver）用中国寓言很好地描述了这一局面 ： “ 青蛙在温吞水中感觉舒适又安全。	The American academic John Garver depicted it best using a Chinese fable: “A frog in a pot of lukewarm water feels quite comfortable and safe.
在巴基斯坦白沙瓦以南的克哈特（Kohat）区，在女接种员的帮助下，未接种儿童从30,000人下降到22,000人，拒绝接种的儿童数量也从月4,000人下降到400人。	In the Pakistani district of Kohat, south of Peshawar, female vaccinators have been credited with helping to lower the number of unvaccinated children from 30,000 to 22,000, and to reduce the number of vaccine refusals from around 4,000 to 400.
而统计方法错误和捏造事实的更惊人例子是哈佛经济学家卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）最为广泛引用的断言 — — 如果一国债务对GDP比率超过90 % ， 其经济增长会大幅度放缓。	An even more spectacular example of a statistical error and sleight of hand is the widely cited claim of Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that countries’ growth slows sharply if their debt/GDP ratio exceeds 90%.
像巴库提这样的当地法塔赫领袖掌握着民族主义武装的制高权力，它们组成了 “阿克萨烈士旅”这样的松散型组织。	Local Fatah leaders like Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of the Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades.
在整个非洲，中等学校和TVET系统正在实现转型，准备好用完成学生到工作者和参与度更高的公民的转变所必须的技能，来武装非洲的年轻头脑。	Across the continent, secondary schools and TVET systems are transforming themselves to prepare Africa’s young minds with the skills they need to make the transition from school to employment, and to become more engaged citizens.
三权分立，是美国建国领导人在Montesquieuz这样的哲学家的影响下建立起来的治国纲领。 但这一原则现如今将美国领向了几近瘫痪的状态。	The separation of powers, a principle established by the US founders under the influence of philosophers such as Montesquieu, is leading today to near-paralysis.
OUN在纳粹拒绝乌克兰独立后便与之决裂，最终与苏联人以及德国人被赶走后的波兰共产主义和反共产主义地下运动武装都有斗争。	The OUN broke with the Nazis after they denied Ukraine independence, and finally fought the Soviets and both the army of Communist Poland and the anticommunist Polish underground after the Germans were routed.
2015年，欧盟的DAC成员国将ODA预算中的97亿美元用在了各自国家的大约120万名寻求庇护者身上。	In 2015, the European Union’s DAC member states spent $9.7 billion of their ODA budgets on approximately 1.2 million asylum-seekers in their own countries.
此外，由于许多可再生能源技术是建立在已开采金属和矿物的基础上，因此全球矿业将在朝向低碳未来的转型中扮演关键角色。	Moreover, because many renewable energy technologies are built with mined metals and minerals, the global mining industry will play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon future.
但即使石油和天然气田几乎在2017年立即完成拍卖，而后成功得到开发，由此所产生的收入最早也要到2022年才会实际抵达。	But even if oil and gas blocks are auctioned off almost immediately, in 2017, and then successfully explored, the resulting revenues would not arrive until 2022 at the earliest.
对于6个月前开始的主席任期，听惯了布莱尔“充满热情的亲欧洲人士”的漂亮口号，这恐怕是一个令人哀伤的结局。	It is a sad conclusion to a presidency, launched six-months ago, with Blair’s claim that he was a “passionate pro-European”. Yet the full text of his speech tells it all.
鉴于经济增长缓慢、失业率居高不下（仅仅因为心灰意冷的工人退出就业大军失业率才有所降低）和通胀率远低于联储目标，现在并不是开始限制流动性的最好时机。	Given slow growth, high unemployment (which has fallen only because discouraged workers are leaving the labor force), and inflation well below the Fed’s target, this is no time to start constraining liquidity.
但欧洲央行的权力是欧元区所缺失的民主政治制度的技术替代物这一事实将是2013年的一个继续发酵的问题。	But the fact that the ECB’s power is only a technocratic substitute for the eurozone’s missing democratic political institutions will remain a growing problem in 2013.
由于这些对中国领导层不利的故事极为敏感，因此这些广受欢迎的报道通常被禁止，编辑因此被撤职，刊登或播报它们的媒体通常受到处罚。	Owing to great sensitivity about stories that cast China’s leadership in a bad light, these popular reports are frequently banned, editors are fired, and media outlets that publish or broadcast them are often punished.
发自新德里 — — 在经历了数十年国际制裁下的孤立和贫困之后，缅甸近来摇身一变成为了希望明灯和亚洲的潜在新亮点。	NEW DELHI – Isolated and impoverished by decades of international sanctions, Myanmar (Burma) has emerged in recent months as both a beacon of hope and a potential new Asian flashpoint.
过去20年来，世界直接外资的流量发生了迅猛的增长，从20世纪80年代的400亿美元一路飙升到了去年的9000亿美元。	World flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have soared over the past two decades, from $40 billion in the early 1980’s to $900 billion last year.
大约六年间，葛兰运动分子一直协助艾尔多安驱逐那些不肯忠于其柔性伊斯兰主义，却对土耳其世俗和民族主义理想宣誓效忠的军队、警察和其他公共部门干部。	Over the course of roughly six years, the Gülenists had helped Erdoğan to oust military and police cadres (among many other public-sector employees) who were loyal to Turkish secular and nationalist ideals, rather than to his own soft Islamism.
该党和由奥斯卡尔·拉方戴内领导的社会民主党异议人士结盟，鼓吹同样激进的提议。 由于左右两翼政府对失业大潮均无计可施，越来越多的法德两国选民似乎不再相信传统的解决方案。	With the evident failure of both leftist and rightist governments to stem the rising wave of unemployment, a growing part of the French and German electorates no longer seems to believe in traditional solutions.
首先，进步的政治经济必须基于对资本主义的坚定信念 — — 即基于大部分资产为私有、主要由市场指导生产和分配收入的经济体系。	First, a progressive political economy must be based on a firm belief in capitalism – that is, on an economic system in which most of the assets are privately owned, and markets largely guide production and distribute income.
海啸发生之后，美国和其它一些富裕国家似乎完全来得及重新考虑他们的援助计划，并有可能对那些最需要救济的国家追加援助资金。	In the wake of the tsunamis, it seems possible that the US and other wealthy countries will rethink their assistance programs and, possibly, step up their aid to those most in need.
此外，过去十年来意大利的经济增长一直很慢，而且看不到加速的迹象，这使得意大利即使实施了财政整合也很难降低公共债务负担。	Moreover, economic growth has been slow for the past decade, and is not accelerating, which will make it difficult to lower the public-debt burden even with fiscal consolidation.
换句话说，如今希腊已经实现了零初级预算赤字，如果其名义增长率超过其政府债务的平均利率，则其债务负担将会降低。	Stated differently, now that Greece has achieved a zero primary budget deficit, its debt burden will decline if its nominal growth rate exceeds the average interest that it pays on its government debt.
但是现在人们普遍认为，美国发动战争的谈判方式是一个错误 — — 这一错误使美国作为谈判一方失去了大量的信誉。	But it is now widely accepted that the way in which the US negotiated its way into war was a mistake – one that has cost it enormous credibility as a negotiating partner.
欧洲没有了萨科齐或者贝卢斯科尼，也没有了英国前首相撒切尔夫人，德国前总统赫尔穆特·科尔以及西班牙前首相何塞·玛丽亚·阿斯纳尔这样的人。	Europe has no Sarkozy or Silvio Berlusconi, but also no Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl, or José Maria Aznar.
他们指出，二战以来，如若危机爆发，则在信心危机结束、经济恢复增长后还将平均持续4.4年 — — 这是必须的“去杠杆化”所需要的时间。	They reckon that the average length of post-war crises has been 4.4 years – the time it takes for the necessary “de-leveraging” to occur – after which the crisis of confidence is over and economic growth revives.
“如果我们要在世界上实现真正的和平 ， ” 圣雄甘地在1931年、即英联邦成立前近二十年时说 ， “ 就必须从教育开始 。 ”	“If we are to reach real peace in this world,” Mahatma Gandhi said in 1931, nearly two decades before the Commonwealth was established, “we shall have to begin with the children.”
此外，尽管朝鲜一再破坏区域和平，但中国对这个流氓政权却给于无条件支持，这也是导致其他国家对中国是否认真对待其邻国的国家安全有所保留的重要原因。	China’s unconditional support for North Korea’s wayward regime, despite its repeated crimes against peace, is also a cause for concern about whether China will treat its neighbors’ security concerns with respect.
若要实现这一点，莫格里尼必须把自己当作受容克和欧洲理事会主席唐纳德·塔斯克（Donald Tusk）支持的领导者。	For that to happen, Mogherini must assert herself as a leader, backed by Juncker and the new European Council president, Donald Tusk.
身为一个在道德上和政治上都被宣传所腐蚀的国家 — — 苏联的前公民，我很清楚“新闻”武器化会造成什么伤害。	As a former citizen of a country – the Soviet Union – that was morally and politically corrupted by propaganda, I am well aware of the damage that can be done by weaponized “news.”
考虑到他在2003年多么不得人心，很多人认为他愿意交出权力，但需要找到确保他名声（和财产）的继任者。	Knowing the extent of his unpopularity in 2003, many believe that he was ready to leave power but needed a successor who would ensure that his legacy (and his wealth) survived.
他们联合起来反对像世界贸易组织（WTO）这样的多边机构，世贸组织是拥有准司法争端解决机制的唯一国际机构，也是谈判和执行全球贸易规则的主要论坛。	They rally against multilateral bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO) – the main forum for negotiating and implementing global trade norms and one of the only international organizations with a quasi-judicial dispute-settlement entity.
社会民主政府不断面临着财富的重新分配严重阻碍了经济增长的指责，并且无法使选民们相信为高等教育的另一次大扩张注入资金是有必要的。	Social-democratic governments have been on the defensive against those who claim that redistributing wealth exacts too high a cost on economic growth, and unable to convince voters to fund yet another massive expansion of higher education.
如果因此引发了自己支持者的反对，他会提醒他们民族团结和互相尊重、而不是狭隘的党派斗争，最终会使宇宙的道德之弧进一步倾向于公正。	And when his own supporters objected, he reminded them that national unity and mutual respect, not narrow partisanship, would eventually bend the moral arc of the universe toward justice.
比如说，如果一位首席执行官不可能赚取超过其企业普通员工收入一定倍数的收入，那么他花在损公肥私这件事上的精力也会有所限制。	If, for example, it becomes impossible for a CEO to earn more than a certain multiple of what the average worker in his or her firm is paid, there will be a limit to how much ingenuity the CEO directs toward pure self-enrichment.
低估的汇率只是各国用以推动出口并限制进口的政策之一。 实施这样的政策使得该国享有贸易顺差而其贸易伙伴们（包括美国）则出现逆差。	Undervalued exchange rates are only one of the policies that countries use to boost exports and restrain imports, so that they run trade surpluses, while their trading partners (including the US) run deficits.
伊斯兰国发言人坚持一字不差地奉行先知穆罕默德及其早期追随者制定的原始戒律，完全不为任何情况做出任何调整。	The Islamic State's spokesmen insist on following the original precepts laid down by the Prophet Mohammed and his earliest followers, understood literally and with no adjustment for different circumstances.
有力证据表明其潜在的危害程度远远大于食品污染物或杀虫剂残留物。 而在法律的制约下，后两者已经降到了很低的水平。	The strength of evidence and the potential magnitude of harm greatly exceed those of food contaminants or pesticide residues, which are appropriately regulated to very low levels.
比如，2月底，德国总理默克尔做出了令人惊讶的坚持：欧洲不需要加固其金融防火墙来保护其他欧元区国家免受希腊的无序违约。	At the end of February, for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a spectacle insisting that no bigger financial firewall was needed to protect other eurozone countries from a disorderly Greek default.
埃及的主要盟国美国差一点支持抗议群众，同时要求穆巴拉克政府在兑现“改善民主”承诺的同时，立即采取措施满足群众的合理要求。	The United States, Egypt’s main ally, while stopping short of siding with the protesters, is holding the regime to Mubarak’s promise of a “better democracy,” and demanding swift action to meet the people’s legitimate demands.
我们必须从个体和集体角度解决人工智能和生物技术等方面的尖端研究所带来的道德和伦理问题。 新科技将大大延长寿命，实现定制婴儿和记忆提取。	We must address, individually and collectively, moral and ethical issues raised by cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, which will enable significant life extension, designer babies, and memory extraction.
第一个是长期的不充分就业不仅伤害了目前也伤害了潜在的产出 — — 通过腐蚀失业人员的“人力资本 ” 。	First, prolonged unemployment destroys not just current but also potential output by eroding the “human capital” of the unemployed.
资源“从有直接用途的当年商品和服务上”如此大规模的“转移 ” ， 我指出 ， “ 只有在它能提振年度总体经济增长0.3%以上，或在25年时间里提振6 % ， 它才是划算的买卖 。 ”	Such a massive diversion of resources “away from goods and services directly useful this year,” I argued, “is a good bargain only if it boosts overall annual economic growth by 0.3% – or 6% per 25-year generation.”
但是，尽管在没有替代方案的情况下，这一脱钩可能持续一段时间，但金融市场表现和大部分人的福利之间的巨大差异不可能长期维持。	But, while this disconnect could continue for some time if no alternative program emerges, the huge gap between financial markets’ performance and most people’s well-being is unlikely to persist in the longer term.
更糟糕的是，大家知道就业的每一个方面都有这样那样的法律或规定，这种想法对工作岗位有害无益，使人无意尝试通过务实的方式解决问题。	Worse yet, the knowledge that some law or regulation covers every aspect of employment poisons the workplace and discourages attempts to resolve problems pragmatically.
近代早期的意大利纺织工人发觉他们的银币工资缩水了，而他们的产品仍然在国际奢侈品市场上保持坚挺的金币价格。	Early modern Italian textile workers would find their pay in silver reduced, while their products still commanded a gold price on the international market for luxuries.
虽然这个例子告诉我们军事政治领导人在袭击核反应堆前应当会三思后行，但仅仅是乌克兰核设施的庞大规模就需要全球更多的注意力。	While that case provides some assurance that military and political leaders will think twice about attacking nuclear reactors, the sheer scale of Ukraine’s nuclear enterprise calls for far greater global concern.
中国的高层人士很快从国际经验中认识到应对企业债务问题将会限制短期经济增长和增加社会成本 — — 例如失业。	Influential voices in China are quick to draw the lesson from international experience that tackling corporate debt can limit short-term growth and impose social costs, such as unemployment.
你也许认为乌克兰人对欧洲式民主理想的英勇决心会给他们带来大量西方支持，帮助他们抵抗俄罗斯的入侵和经济动荡。	One might have expected the heroic commitment of Ukrainians to Europe’s democratic ideals to trigger a rush of Western support for the country in its battle against Russian aggression and economic instability.
但那种更为细致精妙的政策制定 — — 通常基于企业可以被信任或引导去进行自我规管的错误假设 — — 已经失败了。	But more nuanced policymaking – often based on the misguided assumption that companies can be trusted, or induced, to self-regulate – has failed.
除非我们承认并解决这一现实，否则过去七十年来为世界带来了前所未有的和平与繁荣自由世界秩序将继续土崩瓦解。	Unless and until we recognize and address this reality, the liberal world order that has brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to the world over the past seven decades will continue to erode.
同样，雷诺汽车公司54%的股东，其中包括法国政府，在今年4月举行的企业年度股东大会上对CEO卡洛斯·戈恩2，500万欧元（合2，800万美元）的薪酬方案投了反对票。	Similarly, 54% of Renault SA’s shareholders, which include the French state, opposed CEO Carlos Ghosn’s €25 million ($28 million) remuneration package at the company’s AGM in April.
如果你将这些形象与打扮成体面的英国律师但充满了不安全感的年轻甘地的照片相比较，就会发现他深谙符号沟通之道。	If one compares those images with pictures of the young, insecure Gandhi dressed as a proper British lawyer, one can see how carefully he understood symbolic communication.
在穆加贝辞职后，中国外长不遗余力的赞扬“中国和津巴布韦之间的友谊 ” ， 而姆南加古瓦肯定会延续这样的关系。	Following Mugabe’s resignation, China’s foreign ministry went out of its way to praise the “friendship between China and Zimbabwe,” and Mnangagwa can be expected to continue that relationship.
典型的美国家庭知道现在的状况比四年前糟糕了许多，他们并不认为针对高收入群的减税政策真的带来了布什政府所预先承诺的好处。	The typical American family knows that it is worse off today than it was four years ago, and appears unconvinced that the tax cuts targeted at upper-income Americans brought the benefits heralded by the Bush administration.
菲格雷斯的食肉客驱逐计划像是一场运动，它是有害的，因为它表明这位联合国前气候主管眼中只有禁止自己不喜欢的行为，而其依据则是不堪一击的证据和夸大其词的报纸报道。	Like much campaigning, Figueres’s plan for meat-eaters is disturbing, because it suggests that the former UN climate chief is focused on banning behavior she doesn’t like, based on flimsy evidence and over-the-top newspaper reporting.
在我的第一次后1989年中国之旅中，一个酒吧间男服务员向我介绍了一个明确反映新的官方精神的习语 ： “ 没有运动，什么都可以 ” （ 只要没有政治运动，干什么都可以 ） 。	During my first post-1989 trip to China, a bartender introduced me to a phrase that perfectly characterized the new official mood: “Meiyou yundong, shenme dou keyi” (As long as there are no political movements, anything goes).
事实上，在美国这类资本充裕的国家，更多的进口（主要为劳动密集型产品）会提高资本回报率，从而推动国际资本流入该国。	And, indeed, in a more capital-abundant country like the United States, more imports (of mostly labor-intensive products) would raise the returns on capital, creating an incentive for international capital to flow to the country.
在这个快速变化的时代，教育和技能培训应当与贸易和产业等政策相协调，这样才能更有机会满足新兴的劳动力市场需求。	At a time of rapid change, education and skills training should be coordinated with, say, trade and industrial policies to improve the chances that emerging labor-market requirements will be met.
一场完美风暴正在外汇市场上形成。 这一风暴威胁到把欧元升值到令即使欧元区最为具有效率的国家德国无法在世界市场竞争的水平。	A perfect storm is forming in the foreign exchange markets that threatens to catapult the euro to levels that will make even the euro-zone’s most efficient exporter—Germany—unable to compete in world markets.
但这正是奥巴马的另一个非同寻常之处：他身份的复杂性使他具有真正的世界性，成为全球化时代的一位全球化候选人。	But that is another reason why Obama is exceptional: the complexity of his identity makes him truly universal, a global candidate for a global age.
心理学研究表明这三点当中的任何一点都可以很有说服力，而说服力的大小取决于演讲者的魅力以及听众自身的倾向性。	Psychological research has shown that any one of these three can be persuasive, depending on the speaker’s attractiveness or the audience’s predisposition.
但它们都不能不关注一个重要目标：制定一个新政策框架，这个框架要基于存在的共同利益，能够阻止关系的恶化、稳定欧洲-大西洋安全。	But none should distract attention from the important goal of identifying a new policy framework, based on existential common interests, that can stop the downward spiral in relations and stabilize Euro-Atlantic security.
最后，我们可以运动、共和国前进运动以及动力运动（Momentum，帮助科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn）改组英国工党平台的青年运动）都不是因为它们是“运动”而重要。	In the end, Podemos, La République En Marche!, and Momentum, the youth movement that helped Jeremy Corbyn reshape the British Labour Party’s platform, are not important because they are movements per se.
摩索尔是当今反叛力量的主要据点，伊拉克军队驻在那里的一位营长阿里说 ： “ 没有美国人，我们根本不可能控制伊拉克 。 ”	As Iraqi Colonel Omar Ali, the Iraqi battalion commander in Mosul, the main focus of the insurgency today, recently put it, “Without the Americans, it would be impossible for us to control Iraq.”
恰恰相反，这是法国耗时 15 年最终实现与北约和解 — — 以及欧洲防务所取得的实质性进展 — — 的产物。	Rather, it is the product of a 15-year process of rapprochement with NATO – and of the real progress being achieved in European defense.
逊尼派神职人员刚刚宣布要对“伊朗政权、真主党及其宗派盟军”开战圣战，这是穆斯林世界几百万人民的声音。	The Sunni clerics who have just declared a jihad against “the Iranian regime, Hezbollah, and its sectarian allies” are the voice of millions across the Muslim world.
在同意提高消费税的时候，反对派的自由民主党坚持要着手解决造成预算赤字的罪魁祸首 — — 日本退休人员的社会保障和福利开支。	In reaching the agreement to raise the consumption tax, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party insisted that the main squeeze on the budget deficit – the amount spent on social-security benefits for Japan’s retirees – begin to be addressed.
吸引市场人才加入中国庞大的官僚体系的一个关键点是政府高层需要鼓励下属果断独立的政策执行并容忍善意的决策失误，让有才干的官员在面对不确性而作出实时决定时不会有太大压力。	The key to attracting market-oriented talent to China’s large bureaucracy is to make it clear that risk-taking – and even failure – will be tolerated.
局部范围（有时候也出现大规模的）的冲击波，会引起海底斜坡上的海底沉淀物发生滑动倾泻，诸如大陆架斜坡上的海底沉淀物。	Locally, but sometimes still at a grand scale, the shock waves cause major sediment slides on steep underwater slopes such as those of the continental shelves.
从外部看，这里的公司散发着一种特权的味道 — — 比如在扩张进入全世界各大城市 — — 不管是柏林还是里约热内卢 — — 时藐视当地监管。	Viewed from outside, the world sees companies that exude a sense of entitlement – for example, by flouting local regulations as they expand into cities around the world, from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro.
斯瓦蒂·查图尔维迪（Swati Chaturvedi）在其2016年的自白书《我是一个“喷子 ” ： 印度人民党数字义勇军内幕 》 （ I Am A Troll: Inside the Secret World of the BJP’s Digital Army）中透露，印度人民党在印度国内外建立了许多报酬丰厚的水军，每人都操纵多个账号。	As Swati Chaturvedi explained in her 2016 exposé I Am A Troll: Inside the Secret World of the BJP’s Digital Army, cyber cells of well-paid trolls, each operating multiple accounts, have been established in India and abroad.
不幸的是，许多政府已经无力管理他们所释放的力量，而企业领导人也已丧失了责任感，不再关注为他们创造繁荣环境的社会福利制度。	Unfortunately, many governments had already lost the capacity to manage the forces they had unleashed, and business leaders had lost their sense of responsibility for the welfare of the societies within which they were flourishing.
布鲁塞尔—美国总统特朗普和中国国家主席习近平在刚刚结束的布宜诺斯艾利斯G20会议上达成暂时休战，双方都获得了一些时间思考问题之所在。	BRUSSELS – The temporary truce reached by US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the just-concluded G20 meeting in Buenos Aires should give both sides some time to reflect on the issues in question.
考虑到如此严重的危险，停止进一步核竞赛、消除全世界15,000发核武器存量所带来的风险符合所有国家的利益。	Given the grave dangers, it is in every country’s interest to halt further nuclear competition and eliminate the risks associated with the world’s remaining stockpiles of some 15,000 nuclear weapons.
每天，专家们都对伊拉克叛乱、玻利维亚古柯种植、欧洲央行和北朝鲜政治局等各种各样的问题发表高见，但我们对他们的意见到底应该相信多少？	Every day, experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European central bankers, and North Korea’s Politburo. But how much credibility should we attach to the opinions of experts?
事实上，尽管美国总统奥巴马显然渴望结束这一毫无意义的外交冻结，但一些右翼美国政客似乎宁可在佛罗里达州以南存在一个劣等国家而不是潜在伙伴。	Indeed, despite President Barack Obama’s apparent desire to end the pointless diplomatic freeze, some right-wing US politicians would, it seems, prefer a pariah to a potential partner off Florida’s coast.
他不是普通的美国总统，并且，借用《大西洋 》 （ The Atlantic）的塞伦娜·齐拓（Salena Zito）的话，必须认真对待特朗普，但不要从字面上理解他。	He is no ordinary US president, and he must be taken seriously, though not literally, to borrow a phrase from The Atlantic’s Salena Zito.
葛兰分子也因此可以将其玩弄于股掌之上 — — 比方说，保证军方有破坏力的泄密（其中最惊人的往往是捏造的）会在自由媒体首先发布。	And it allowed the Gülenists to play them – for example, by ensuring that damaging leaks from the military (the most egregious of which were fabricated) would be published in liberal outlets first.
类似地，欧元区在2008年金融危机后的恢复也受到严格财政规则的掣肘，这些规则规定成员国财政赤字水平不能超过GDP的3 % 。	Likewise, the eurozone’s recovery from the 2008 financial crisis has been held back by strict fiscal rules that limit member countries’ fiscal deficits to 3% of GDP.
但由军队占统治地位的政治系统排斥这类参与，因此随着经济不断增长，政治的去军队化成为所有大型军管穆斯林国家 — — 从印尼到地中海沿岸 — — 的群众呼声。	Military-dominated political systems precluded such participation, so, with economic growth, demilitarization of politics became a rallying cry in all large military-led Muslim states, from Indonesia to the Mediterranean coast.
在这方面，中国和沙特阿拉伯堪称杰出 — — 尽管它们绝不是“孤家寡人 ” — —组织了一系列日益厚颜无耻的绑架或让批评者失踪。	Here, China and Saudi Arabia stand out – though they are by no means alone – for orchestrating a series of increasingly brazen abductions or vanishings of their detractors.
为了更好地贯彻IMF双重宗旨的另外一半，IMF已经释出信号，表明它将增募资金，从2009年4月伦敦G20会议上通过的7500亿美元增加到1万亿美元。	In order to better carry out the other half of its dual mandate, the IMF has signaled that it will ask for a further increase in its resources, to $1 trillion, up from the $750 billion agreed at the London G-20 meeting in April 2009.
福格的策略被推广到东尼日利亚，然后又引入西非的其他地区，最终应用到最具挑战性的环境：拥有五亿人口的印度。	Foege’s strategy was extended to eastern Nigeria, then introduced to other parts of West Africa, and ultimately applied to the most challenging environment of all: India, with its half-billion people.
这个世界晚宴上最受青睐的演讲嘉宾包括右翼共和党人士德克萨斯前州长里克·佩里，佩里曾经把同性恋和酗酒相提并论。	Favored speakers at This World galas include the right-wing Republican former governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who once compared homosexuality to alcoholism.
在英国，扭转肥胖趋势可以让全国医保（National Health Service）每年节约约12亿美元。	In the UK, reversing obesity trends could save the National Health Service about $1.2 billion a year.
全世界只有不到一半的学龄难民儿童有学可上；有不到1/4的人能上到中学；不到1％的人可以继续接受高等教育。	Fewer than half of school-age refugee children worldwide attend school; not even one in four make it to secondary school; and under 1% go on to pursue a higher education.
正如伊曼纽尔·坎特（Immanuel Kant）在很久之前所指出的那样，实行民主制度的国家一般都不愿互相攻伐，因此应该推动民主以实现和平。	Because, as Immanuel Kant noted long ago, states with democratic political systems tend not to fight with each other, democracy should be encouraged in order to secure peace.
而他们对此的回应则涵盖对指标测量方式，劳动力市场结构转变，潜在性的投资机会缺乏，稀释生产率的技术创新以及技术导致的技能错配等问题。	Their response covers concerns about measurement, structural shifts in the labor market, a potential paucity of investment opportunities, productivity-diluting technological innovations, and technology-driven skills mismatches.
和许多学界和发展界人士一样，我也是全球化的最大受益者之一 — — 我们能够将我们的服务在比我们的父辈所能想象的更大更富有的市场上出售。	Like many in academia and in the development industry, I am among globalization’s greatest beneficiaries – those who are able to sell our services in markets that are larger and richer than our parents could have dreamed of.
鉴于美国财政赤字庞大，中国正在推行宽松财政和信贷政策，欧洲仍处于复苏之路，当前的全球扩张势头可能会持续到明年。	The current global expansion will likely continue into next year, given that the US is running large fiscal deficits, China is pursuing loose fiscal and credit policies, and Europe remains on a recovery path.
"40美元一桶的油价预计会使全球潜在产出的长期年增长率降低近01 . % ，而60美元一桶的油价将会""可衡量的""全球潜在产出长期年增长率降低近0.3 % 。"	"At $40 a barrel, expect oil prices to slow the long-run growth rate of the world's potential output by 0.1% per year. At $60 a barrel, expect the ""measured"" long-term rate of potential world output growth to slow by roughly 0.3% per year."
过去20年来，土耳其取得了令人瞩目的经济成就，从欧洲病夫一跃成为欧洲最具活力的经济体之一和新的中东贸易中心区。	Over the past two decades, Turkey has made remarkable economic strides, transforming itself from Europe’s sick man into one of its most vibrant economies and a new center of gravity for trade in the Middle East.
这也许还没有到达欧洲央行“低于但接近2 % ” 的目标，但显然无法论证欧洲央行日益激进地动用货币工具刺激经济。	This may fall short of the European Central Bank’s target of “below but close to 2%,” but not by a margin substantial enough to justify the ECB’s increasingly aggressive use of monetary instruments to stimulate the economy.
"对""叶利钦式民主""的失望推动普京总统寻找以民族主义和国家荣誉为基础的全新意识形态，这被普京称为""管理下的多元论 。 """	"Disillusion with ""democracy Boris Yeltsin-style"" has pushed President Vladimir Putin to search for an ideology based on nationalism and the glorification of the state. Putin calls it ""managed pluralism."""
尽管这些政策或有助于价格稳定，但他的方案忽略了巴西央行问题最重要的两个方面：法律自主权和保证公民问责权的制度改革。	While such policies may promote price stability, his proposal neglects the two most important issues for the BCB: legal autonomy and institutional reforms that ensure accountability to citizens.
六四危机，通过团结党领导层的重新团结以及党和城市人民之间的团结的重新建立，巩固了中国共产党的统治，并加速了目前这一轮中国经济高速发展的势头。	By reunifying the Party leadership and re-establishing solidarity between the Party and the urban population, the crisis consolidated CCP rule, and accelerated China’s momentum down its current path of rapid economic growth.
以色列的袭击获得了开门红，而哈马斯也因成功地用导弹袭击了特拉维夫感到欢欣鼓舞，这一成就让真主党在2006年黎巴嫩战争中的成果相形见绌。	Israel’s assault scored impressive initial successes, while Hamas can take pride in having reached Tel Aviv with its missiles, an achievement that eluded Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon War.
有鉴于此，阿拉伯的国家主义政府们认为抗拒严肃的政治改革是完全必要的，而压制国内的反对派，特别是日长夜大的伊斯兰主义运动也是合情合理的。	As a result, Arab nationalist governments feel justified in resisting serious political reform and vindicated in repressing all domestic opposition, particularly the swelling Islamist movements.
监管也好，分业经营也好，大部分银行业改革方案仍然停留在纸上作业阶段，金融游说集团一定会竭尽所能削弱它们的功效。	Whether relying on regulation, or gesturing towards institutional separation, most proposals for banking reform remain at the drawing-board stage, and are sure to be emasculated by financial lobbies.
伊斯兰国信奉原教旨主义的瓦哈比派思想，他们极度嗜血，目标是回归想象中的前现代哈里发帝国，征服什叶派并将非穆斯林打为二等公民。	Powered by a fundamentalist Wahhabi ideology and a boundless appetite for bloodshed, the Islamic State seeks a return to an imagined pre-modern caliphate that subjugates Shia and treats non-Muslims as second-class citizens.
他们还可能合理地得出结论，他未能将其部分福克斯新闻台的薪金导入401(K)账户，是针对他所述语言的极为有力的论证。	And they might reasonably conclude that his failure to channel some of his Fox News salary into a 401(k) account is a very powerful argument against the words coming out of his mouth.
如果该党能获得45%以上的国内选票，那么依据土耳其选举法的奇怪规定，就能在550个议会席位中拥有代表超过330个。	If the party is able to secure more than 45% of the national vote, the quirks in Turkey’s electoral law will give it more than 330 representatives in the country’s 550-seat legislature.
只有合作能带来和平，摆脱无用、危险、终将破产的新军备竞赛 — — 这次包括网络武器、空间武器和下一代核武器。	Only cooperation can deliver peace and the escape from a useless, dangerous, and ultimately bankrupting new arms race, this time including cyber-weapons, space weapons, and next-generation nuclear weapons.
但是，如果阿根廷获得足够投资建设让瓦卡穆尔塔页岩资源盈利所需要的基础设施 — — 管道、铁路、石英矿和废物站 — — 阿根廷有可能会因为充分开采而受困。	Yet, if Argentina receives sufficient investment to build the infrastructure – the pipelines, railways, silica mines, and waste sites – needed to make Vaca Muerta profitable, the country may become effectively locked into full exploitation.
我们观察到，大部分涉及到的机构 — — 贝尔斯登（Bear Stearns ） 、 雷曼兄弟（Lehman Brothers ） 、 房利美以及GSE房贷美（Freddie Mac ） 、 AIG、华盛顿互惠银行（MaWu）和美联银行（Wachovia ） — —都没有被格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案所覆盖，这让人怀疑它的向心性。	The observation that most of the institutions involved – Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae, the GSE Freddie Mac, AIG, WaMu, and Wachovia – were not covered by Glass-Steagall calls into question its centrality.
我们相信只要激励措施得当，基础设施对那些拥有长期负债的机构而言完全可以成为创新且有吸引力的资产类别。	We believe that with the right incentives, infrastructure can be an innovative and attractive asset class for those with long-term liabilities.
最为重要的是，对预先宣告的争议表明在欧洲央行的管理委员会中，迫切需要一致精神和权力分享精神的重新兴起。	More than anything, the pre-announcement controversy demonstrates that a renewed spirit of consensus and collegiality in the ECB’s Governing Council is sorely needed.
不幸的是，变异型克雅氏病在加拿大、法国、爱尔兰、意大利、日本、荷兰、葡萄牙、沙特阿拉伯和美国的发病率也逐年上升。	This unfortunately has been accompanied by increasing number of variant CJD cases in Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and the USA.
这些观点认为，对经济大萧条和二战后年代中的工业化经济体而言，这些养老金体制是不错的，但是，在当今高科技、网络化以及后工业化经济体中，他们已经落伍了。	These programs were fine, the argument goes, for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the post-World War II generation, but they have become obsolete in today’s high-tech, networked, post-industrial economy.
不仅如此，真正意义上的技术执政将建立一支有官僚管理经验的健全的公务员队伍，利用大数据来衡量和优化福利政策。	Moreover, a real technocracy would boast a robust civil service trained in bureaucratic management techniques that use data to measure and optimize welfare.
如果那是我们想要的未来，我们应该意识清醒地向这一目标大踏步前进。 我们不能漫无目的地乱逛直到落入陷阱，之后才抬起头来，迷迷糊糊地不知道怎么会这样。	If that is the future we want, we should stride toward it with full awareness and a sense of purpose, not meander carelessly until we fall into a hole, look up, and wonder how we got there.
无奈事与愿违，不但冒出了一个悬浮议会（英国政治术语，意指在英国下议院选举中无任何政党赢得总共650个席位中的半数以上 ） , 还可能导致今年晚些时候再来一场大选。	It ended up doing the opposite, producing a hung parliament and the likelihood of another general election later in the year.
像壳牌的专家一样，埃克森公司的科学家预测海平面将破坏性上升，并警告美国中西部和世界其他地区可能会变为沙漠。	Like Shell’s experts, Exxon’s scientists predicted devastating sea-level rise, and warned that the American Midwest and other parts of the world could become desert-like.
但是，尽管这两个条件在9月初都已实现，FOMC仍决定保持利率不变，给出的解释是其担忧全球经济环境，特别是中国的情况。	But, although both conditions were met earlier in September, the FOMC decided to leave the rate unchanged, explaining that it was concerned about global economic conditions and about events in China in particular.
上述理念同样无法承受不被民众理解、国内政客也不愿承担责任的规章和行动所招致的对欧盟机构的不可避免的攻击。	Nor can it withstand the inevitable attacks directed against EU institutions for every action and regulation that citizens dislike and for which national politicians want to avoid responsibility.
在欧洲，危机的根源来自于一个单一政治联盟的缺位，因为这是分担债务并以此将欧元构筑在一个合理基础之上的必要前提。	In Europe, the absence of a political union – considered a necessary precondition for sharing debt obligations and, thus, putting the euro on a sound footing – is widely held to lie at the root of the continent’s crisis.
尽管这一方案明确了日本利用欧战并且在欧洲各国在东南亚取得立足点的愿望，但是它并未明确说明谁是日本的真正敌人。	Although it made clear Japan’s desire to take advantage of the European conflict and gain a foothold in the European colonies in Southeast Asia, the plan was not clear about who constituted Japan’s true enemy.
一项研究表明，在20世纪独立国家的1 941名执政者中，只有27名女性，其中还有一半是以男性执政者的遗孀或女儿身份问鼎权力的。	One study of the 1,941 rulers of independent countries during the twentieth century found only 27 women, roughly half of whom came to power as widows or daughters of a male ruler.
但大多数这类政策 — — 可能银行联盟除外 — — 都旨在应对违约风险，而非铲除导致这一风险的根源。	But most of these policies – with the possible exception of the banking union – are aimed at managing default risk, not eliminating this risk’s root causes.
第二个阻力是，对西方来说，最有利的做法是袖手旁观，同时利用制裁和节节下跌的油价拖垮俄罗斯经济，最终打败普京本人。	The second objection is that the West would be best served by simply standing back and watching while sanctions and plunging oil prices bring down Russia’s economy – and ultimately Putin himself.
与此相反，各国政府却奋力延长这些不可持续的繁荣，从而进一步推高商品价格，并且增加了那种“千载难逢”的经济和金融混乱的风险。	Instead, governments are clawing to stretch out unsustainable booms, further pushing up commodity prices, and raising the risk of a once-in-a-lifetime economic and financial mess.
在意大利，民族主义的联盟党（League）与民粹主义的五星运动（Five Star Movement）组成执政联盟发号施令。	In Italy, the nationalist League party appears to be calling the shots in its new governing coalition with the populist Five Star Movement.
基于歪曲伊斯兰教义的极端主义仍在不断膨胀；事实上，只有靠宗教的方式（加上相应安全措施）才能遏制它的滋长。	Extremism based on a perversion of Islam shows no sign of abating; indeed, it will not abate until it is taken on religiously, as well as by security measures.
但制造健康还需要相关人等开展“投资合作”��—也就是让他们努力提升自己的“健康生产率 ” ， 就像企业需要激励员工提高生产率一样。	But producing health also requires “co-investment” by the people involved – that is, getting them to exert themselves to increase their “health productivity,” just as a company needs to motivate its workers to increase productivity.
匈牙利即将执掌欧盟大权，而对该国总理维克托·奥尔班篡改宪法镇压媒体的讨论却日趋激烈，同时还夹杂着人们对该国金融稳定性的再度忧虑。	Hungary’s turn at the EU helm comes at a time of fierce debate over Prime Minister Victor Orbán’s alteration of constitutional law and suppression of press freedom, as well as a new round of worries about the country’s financial sustainability.
它们是为国内不平��所困扰的正在崛起的力量，不停地向民族主义的方向发展、向处于主导地位的力量发起挑战，最终引发逆转经济全球化进展的世界战争。	A rising power, beset with internal inequality, turns to nationalism and challenges the dominant power, provoking a war that turns back the progress of economic globalization.
最近我们从新德里的一家制衣厂中营救了一批孩子，在过去三年多的时间中他们被迫待在一个不通风的地下室里每天工作20个小时。	Recently, we rescued children from a garment factory in New Delhi, where, for more than three years, they had been forced to sit and work for 20 hours a day in a basement with no ventilation.
2010年危机爆发（即希腊和其他国家的财政问题引发金融市场焦虑）前，有些经济学家纷纷猜测欧元很可能迅速取代美元而成为世界主要储备货币。	Until the crisis of 2010, when fiscal problems in Greece and elsewhere created anxiety in financial markets, some economists had speculated that the euro might soon replace the dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency.
在美国境内，过去三年就业人口从2007年的1.378亿人轻微下降到2010年7月的1.3亿人，减少了790万人 — — 要知道这段时间内人口还增长了600万。	In the United States, the past three years have seen employment fall from 137.8 million people in July 2007 to slightly less than 130 million in July 2010 – a decline of 7.9 million during a period in which the adult population grew by six million.
但有一点是显而易见的，国家（state）具有超越民族重点问题（national priority）的共同利益。	Yet one is obvious: States possess common interests that should trump national priorities.
长期方案，比如建立和连通生化检测系统等，应该予以扩大和强化，让全世界公共卫生专业人员能够追踪和报告人类和动物疫情，共同规划防御方案。	And long-term solutions such as establishing and connecting bio-surveillance systems should be expanded and strengthened, to enable public-health professionals around the world to track and report human and animal diseases and plan defenses together.
他们更有可能在动用在叙利亚的权力保护自己，或者在权力被削弱的情况下逃往莫斯科或德黑兰，阻挠对他们的抓捕行动。	They are more likely to use their power in Syria to shield themselves and, if weakened, flee to Moscow or Tehran, delaying efforts to apprehend them.
而欧盟也自顾不暇，因为它们既头痛于如何处理竞争力下降的问题，又为如何支付那些人们自以为应得的福利而苦恼。	Europeans continue to look inward, obsessed with their own problems of declining competitiveness and how to pay for entitlements that they have come to regard as theirs by right.
只有一样东西能阻止决心为ISIS而死的自杀青年：将他引向正确道路、让他相信神创造我们是为了改善而不是摧毁世界的更强大的意识形态。	Only one thing can stop a suicidal youth who is ready to die for ISIS: a stronger ideology that guides him onto the right path and convinces him that God created us to improve our world, not to destroy it.
管理层和董事会成员常常获得股权补偿，这不但使他们获得了权益，反过来又创造了一个使公司股票市场价值最大化的强大诱因。	Managers and board members often receive stock-based compensation, which gives them equity ownership rights and, in turn, creates a powerful incentive to maximize the market value of their companies’ shares.
处于同一状态的保守党政客如果了解一下已经导致了3,600多起暴力死亡的“爱尔兰问题 ” ， 将大有裨益。	Conservative politicians who find themselves in such a position would do well to know that conflicts over the “Irish question” have resulted in more than 3,600 violent deaths.
可虽然特朗普在竞选时走的是民粹主义，他的统治手段却是财阀式的，最近的例子就是他为大多数共和党人仍然坚信的那种极不可靠的供给侧税收理论背书。	But while Trump ran as a populist, he has governed as a plutocrat, most recently by endorsing the discredited supply-side theory of taxation that most Republicans still cling to.
当然，上海国际能源交易所按交易量计算仍落后于在伦敦交易的布伦特原油合约以及在纽约交易的西德克萨斯中质原油期货合同。	Of course the volume of trades on the Shanghai INE still lags behind that of the Brent oil contracts traded in London and the West Texas Intermediate oil futures traded in New York.
当越战败局已定时，美国的重点从该地区离开，让胜利者来收拾残局 — — 并最终加入东盟安全与合作格局。	When its defeat became apparent in Vietnam, the US pivoted away from the region, leaving the victor to clean up the mess – and, ultimately, to join the ASEAN structure of security and cooperation.
在捷克、匈牙利和波兰，在最后日期前完成如此艰难的改革任务，对社会主义政党来说，意味着他们不得不背叛他们在左翼选民眼里的社会主义者身份。	"In the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, the task of completing such difficult reforms just before crossing the ""finish line"" fell to socialist parties, forcing them to betray their socialist identity in the eyes of leftist voters."
但该过程导致其双轨经济在效益方面的裂变，国有企业表现明显劣于民营企业，尽管前者比后者更容易获得信贷。	But the process has created significant discrepancies in economic performance, with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) performing significantly worse than their private-sector counterparts, despite having better access to credit.
但是，除了美国可能例外，大部分发达经济体的增长仍将十分疲软，新兴市场的脆弱性 — — 包括中国在经济再平衡方面的措施不够确定 — — 可能将拖累新一年的全球增长。	But, with the possible exception of the US, growth will remain anemic in most advanced economies, and emerging-market fragility – including China’s uncertain efforts at economic rebalancing – could become a drag on global growth in subsequent years.
伦敦 – 2017年2月，我写了一则乐观的评论，题目是《令人惊喜的全球经济恢复力 》 （ The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience ） 。	LONDON – In February 2017, I wrote an optimistic commentary called “The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience.”
并且，抛去程度问题不谈，俄罗斯也绝不是唯一一个在举办奥运会、一级方程式锦标赛（今年晚些时候也将在索契进行）和世界杯足球赛期间横生贪污腐败的国家。	And, the grand scale aside, Russia is hardly the only country where Olympic sports, Formula One racing (also to take place later this year in Sochi), or World Cup soccer is a boon for larceny and graft.
但随后不久，货币紧缩让经济增长回到了减速轨道，促使政府放松政策并在2011年年底、2012年年引入了微型刺激计划。	Soon after, however, monetary tightening put economic growth back on a downward trajectory, spurring the government to loosen policy and introduce mini-stimulus packages in late 2011 and early 2012.
中国决策层就像是在下围棋，需要将国家的关键棋子 — — 即国有企业商业模式的改变 — — 在正确的时间落在正确的地方，而且棋子与棋子之间还要互相协调。	As in a game of Go, China’s leaders need to move the country’s pieces – that is to say, effect change in the SOEs’ business models – in the right place, at the right time, and in a coordinated fashion.
而如今他们却又面对着尖锐的职责，正如意大利中央银行行长马里奥·德拉齐指出的那样，许多国家央行的独立性都受到了极大挑战，特别是欧元区内的那几家。	Today, however, central banks are being sharply criticized, and their independence is coming under severe pressure in many countries, particularly in the eurozone, as Mario Draghi, the head of the Bank of Italy, recently pointed out.
将投资税收优惠扩大到德国企业也许更能刺激支出，但这样做在一个劳动力占国民收入比重已经处于下降趋势的国家存在政治问题。	Extending investment tax credits to German firms might be more effective in boosting spending, but doing so would be politically problematic in a country where labor’s share of national income is already declining.
金融包容性对实现包容性经济增长和性别平等至关重要，而且随着世界银行旨在到2020年实现全面金融覆盖，其在全球发展工作中已经发挥了显著的作用。	Financial inclusion is vital for inclusive economic growth and gender equality, and it has assumed a prominent role in global development efforts, with the World Bank aiming for universal financial inclusion by 2020.
作为回应，温家宝总理在全国人大会议期间公布了一系列措施，从在未来五年逐渐减免农业税到旨在增加农民收入的举措。	In response, Premier Wen Jiabao announced a series of measures during the NPC, ranging from phasing out agricultural taxes over the next five years to measures aimed at increasing farmers' income.
比如，近代欧洲流行一种观点，那就是如果一个女人婚前有过性行为，她就可能把爱人的印记留在自己体内，如果她婚后生子，小孩就可能会更像她从前的恋人，而不像现在的丈夫。	For example, pre-modern Europe believed that a woman who had sex before marriage might carry the imprint of her lover within her, so that her child born in wedlock would resemble the earlier lover, rather than the husband.
近年来，朝鲜在全球范围内发起了大量网络攻击，其中最著名的一次是针对索尼影业，此外还针对许多金融机构。	In recent years, North Korea has launched numerous cyber attacks around the world, most notably against Sony Pictures, but also against many financial institutions.
这就解释了为什么Skillful正在利用行业和地理数据来协助劳动者发掘本身已经具备的符合市场需要的技能、锁定他们可能想从事的职业，以及可以追求进一步职业发展或新职位的场合。	That is why Skillful is leveraging industry and geographical data to help workers discover marketable skills they already have, careers they might want, and places where they can pursue further professional development or new employment.
当时所做出的政治决策远比在巴尔干地区做出的决策风险更大，而希腊和伊比利亚的成功故事充分表明了当时所做出的勇敢决定的睿智。	Political decisions taken then were far more risky than those at hand in the Balkans, and the Greek and Iberian success stories demonstrate the wisdom of the courageous decisions taken at that time.
但有一个国家可以帮助全世界实现急需的透明度 — — 并具有四两拨千斤的影响力，那就是中国，因为朝鲜和伊朗两国的核关系必须通过中国才能实现。	One country could help the world gain the transparency – and the leverage – that it needs: China, over whose territory Iran and North Korea must be conducting their nuclear relations.
这种状况也推动食品价格上涨，迄今为止至少令3000万贫困人口陷入饥饿，到2020年预计还有4千到1亿3千万人会加入饥饿大军。	It also drives up food prices, which so far has pushed at least 30 million poor people into starvation, with another 40-130 million expected to be starving by 2020.
但是，在制定具体政策的时候必须慎之又慎，历史上，意在降低商品价格波动性的措施最后反而助长波动的例子数不胜数。	But adverse movements in the terms of trade must be accommodated; they cannot be fought with monetary policy.
此外还有库尔德人尚未得偿所愿的建国野心（他们中有大量生活在土耳其、斯拉克、叙利亚和伊朗）以及如何调和以色列的现实和巴勒斯坦人的政治目标这一悬而未决的问题。	There are also the unfulfilled national aspirations of the Kurds (large numbers of whom live in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran) and the unresolved matter of how to reconcile the reality of Israel with the Palestinians’ political goals.
在某些地区 — — 包括埃及南部、黎巴嫩山区和安纳托利亚（Anatolia）东南部 — — 基督徒更是占据绝对多数。	In certain areas – including southern Egypt, the mountains of Lebanon, and southeastern Anatolia – they formed an absolute majority.
“软实力 ” — —通过吸引和劝说而非强制和收买来影响他人的能力 — — 有时被用来形容任何不涉及武力的权力行使 — — 但这是错误的。	The term “soft power” – the ability to affect others by attraction and persuasion rather than the hard power of coercion and payment – is sometimes used to describe any exercise of power that does not involve the use of force.
最近，全球保护主义的兴起让这一困境变得更加糟糕，一个明证是富士康公司（苹果公司的主要供应商）决定在华盛顿投资100亿美元建设新工厂。	Recently, the rise in global protectionism has made this difficult situation worse, as epitomized by the decision of Foxconn (a major supplier to Apple) to invest $10 billion in a new factory in Wisconsin.
他必须从现在 — — 即第一次出访北约、出席G7峰会开始。 在出访的前几站，即沙特阿拉伯和以色列，他已经表现出略微朝这个方向转变的迹象。	Trump’s presence at the NATO and G7 summits, in particular, has created more uncertainty, underscored by German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s statement that, “The times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over.”
因此，去年12月，我寻求引入修正刑法典第377条并让一切成年人之间的性行为（不论性别和取向）脱罪的法案。	So, last December, I sought to introduce a bill that would have amended Section 377 and decriminalized all consensual sex between adults, irrespective of their gender and sexuality.
当时，所有人都认为已经给了和平足够的机会。 （没有给和平足够的机会，这正是为什么号召在外交努力已被认为无法取得任何成果时时马上结束通常是错误的。	No one at the time tried to argue that peace was not given a chance, which is why advocating a quick end to diplomacy when it is judged unlikely to achieve anything is often a mistake.
然而在此之后美国经济鸿沟却日益拉宽，对那些没有受过大学教育的人产生了毁灭性的影响，而该群体里包含了近3/4的非裔美国人。	And yet the economic divide in the US has grown much wider, with devastating effects on those without a college education, a group that includes almost three-quarters of African-Americans.
此外，通过任命性别平衡的内阁，领导者正在有意识地面对女性在政治领域的某种共同经历：那就是，女性在数量上远低于她们的男性同僚。	Moreover, by appointing gender-balanced cabinets, leaders are intentionally addressing a common experience for women in politics: being vastly outnumbered by male counterparts.
坎布里奇—约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz ） 、 罗杰·法尔莫（Roger Farmer）和我现在是、并且早就已经在什么才是最重要的要点方面达成了一致。	CAMBRIDGE – Joseph Stiglitz, Roger Farmer, and I are now and have long been in agreement on what are probably the most important points.
印度空间研究组织（ISRO）的科学家们自信从这一教训中汲取了宝贵的经验，但Chandrayaan任务的局部失败仍使他们挥之不去的阴影。	While scientists at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) believe that they gained valuable lessons from the experience, the partial failure of the Chandrayaan mission still haunts them.
但他们的观点被西尼尔（Nassau Senior）反对，他认为就连食品救济都不应该有：尽管数百万人因爱尔兰土豆饥荒丧命，但“这远远不够 。 ”	But they were balanced by those like Nassau Senior, who spoke out against even famine relief: Although a million people would die in the Irish Potato Famine, “that would scarcely be enough.”
这不仅缩短了它们的通讯时间；也改善了能源效率，幅度可达5,000倍 — — 有望产生能源效率接近生物脑的计算机。	This not only reduces the time they take to communicate; it improves energy efficiency by a factor of as much as 5,000 – potentially providing computers with efficiency close to that of a biological brain.
为了将生物医学工程应用于难民健康挑战，学生，专家和从业者需要去熟悉难民定居点的条件，并加深对困难难民所受复杂创伤的理解。	To apply biomedical engineering to refugee health challenges, students, experts, and practitioners need to familiarize themselves with conditions in refugee settlements, and deepen their understanding of the complex traumas that afflict refugees.
沙特阿拉伯支持与巴林街头示威者的和平谈判，也向巴林提供了大量经济援助用于改善生活，但我们永远不会接受伊朗对巴林的吞并。	Saudi Arabia has supported peaceful negotiations with street protesters in Bahrain, and has provided the country with considerable economic aid to improve life there, but we will never accept an Iranian takeover.
在更宏观方面，特朗普声称世界贸易组织（WTO）已经失能 — — 例如对中国而言 — — 而美国应该退出该组织。	More broadly, Trump argues that the World Trade Organization has failed – for example, with regard to China – and that the United States should withdraw from the organization.
而在大选中遭到对手暗算的两位总统候选人 — — 也都是当年的老革命 — — 则本能地把眼前的局面视为一次历史的重演。	The cheated presidential candidates, both veterans of the revolution, instinctively thought of a replay of history.
战斗加剧了地区不稳定局势；美国和欧洲公民正涌入叙利亚参加圣战；而且一战后中东边界正在解体的看法也越来越被人们所接受。	The fighting has heightened instability in the region; US and European citizens are streaming into Syria to take up jihad; and there is a growing consensus that the post-World War I Middle East boundaries are coming undone.
失业大军中不仅包括建筑工人，还包括水暖工和电工等房地产附属工种，以及房地产中介和银行职员等辅助性行业。	The unemployed comprise not only construction workers, but also ancillary workers, such as real-estate brokers and bankers, as well as all those who work on houses, such as plumbers and electricians.
只有欧洲央行承担起最终贷款人的角色，才能制止欧元区资本外流，并恢复人们对欧洲解决自身问题能力的信心。	Only the ECB, by taking on the role of lender of last resort, can stop the eurozone’s capital outflow and restore confidence in Europe’s capacity to solve its own problems.
对此法国历史学家和社会学家伊曼努尔·托德（Emmanuel Todd）认为，无论在世界哪个地方，经济腾飞通常都会在一国50%以上民众脱离文盲后的60~70年后实现。	The French historian and sociologist Emmanuel Todd has argued that, everywhere in the world, economic takeoff usually occurs 60-70 years after 50% of the population achieves literacy.
纽约—伊斯坦布尔、达卡和巴格达的致命恐怖袭击表明伊斯兰国（ISIS）的魔爪已经触及欧洲、北非、中东和亚洲多部。	NEW YORK – Deadly terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Dhaka, and Baghdad demonstrate the murderous reach of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.
我们怎能肯定它们不会“泄露”并感染更大范围的系统，或者被转作其他用途，再或者未来的无赖国家或恐怖分子不会利用它们反过来攻击它们的创造者？	How can we be sure that they won’t “escape” and infect a much broader class of systems, or be adopted for other uses, or that future rogue states or terrorists won’t find a way to turn them on their creators?
如果政府果真更为积极，那么为什么我们没有见到对其他争议，例如盗取农田、投资者权利受损或者高层腐败等的类似的反应呢？	If the government were truly becoming more responsive, why have we not seen similar responses to other disputes over the theft of farmland, compromised investors’ rights, or high-level corruption?
研究显示，非矿物燃料能源资源 — — 依据目前的可应用性 — — 在帮助我们在2050年保持一个稳定的碳排放量方面也只能解决不到一半的需要，而在达成2100年目标方面也只能是杯水车薪。	Research shows that non-fossil fuel energy sources will – based on today’s availability – get us less than halfway toward a path of stable carbon emissions by 2050, and only a tiny fraction of the way towards stabilization by 2100.
这意味着不仅要承认卡扎菲政策及当前问题间有着重要的联系，而且还要确保不会在抹去卡扎菲记忆的仓促浪潮中牺牲本应被保留的东西。	That means not only recognizing the vital link between his policies and today’s problems, but also ensuring that what should be preserved is not sacrificed in the rush to efface his memory.
问题不在于政府和央行无法重塑就业，或不知道如何重塑就业；而在于政府和央行不会采取规模足够大的扩张性政策步骤来迅速重塑充分就业。	The issue is not that governments and central banks cannot restore employment, or do not know how; it is that governments and central banks will not take expansionary policy steps on a large enough scale to restore full employment rapidly.
欧盟各成员国在一些敏感的政治议题，例如税收，健康教育，养老金，就业市场以及外交政策等方面，都有自己的决定权。	The EU’s member states retain power over the most sensitive political issues, including taxes, health, education, pensions, the labor market, and foreign policy.
首先也是最重要的，奥巴马必须在国会的支持下要求披露所有与美国国家安全机构和美国IT企业间互动有关的信息。	First and foremost, Obama, with support from Congress, must demand the release of all information regarding interactions between national security agencies and American IT firms.
但这一委员会能给默克尔带来额外的政治收益 — — 它可以限制她的副总理兼财政部长、社会民主党的欧拉夫·舒尔茨（Olaf Scholz）的影响力。	Yes, such a committee would bring Merkel the added political benefit of constraining the influence of Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, her Vice-Chancellor and finance minister.
而那些粗鲁些的英国退欧主义者则明确表示他们要让不加管制就会遍布英国各地的强奸犯、罪犯和拼命生小孩的外国人（尤其是土耳其人）进不了英国。	And the cruder Brexiteers were explicit that they would deny entry to the rapists, criminals, and fast-breeding foreigners (Turks in particular) who would otherwise flood the land.
一些国家重启了资本账户流入管制，如对购买本国债券、股票和衍生品的外国投资者征税、对短期资本流实施储备金要求等。	Some resorted to capital-account regulations on inflows, such as taxes on the foreign purchases of bonds, equities, and derivatives, reserve requirements on short-term inflows, and so forth.
假设确是如此 — — 许多这些地区的决策者都倾向如此 — — 耶伦对美国银行系统“大大增强”的担保也将适用于发达世界的其他所有具系统重要性的银行管理辖区。	Assuming that it does, as policymakers there intend, Yellen’s assurance of a “much stronger” banking system in the US will apply to all of the other systemically important banking jurisdictions in the developed world, too.
因为真正的大新闻是上月英国、德国，法国和意大利与其他30多个国家一同成为亚洲基础设施投资银行（亚投行）的创始国。	Indeed, that news was made last month, when the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy joined more than 30 other countries as founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
基于实用主义政治考虑（比如利比亚-意大利关系）或裙带主义的大资金分配应该被重新评估，并要以更好更强的治理实践作为标准。	Large allocations based on pragmatic political concerns, such as Libya-Italy relations, or cronyism should be reevaluated in the light of better and stronger governance practices.
AGOA包含一个日落条款，但是，如果正如在香港世贸会议规定的那样将针对非洲欠发达国家而言免税准入永久化，那么亚洲穷国将继续失去美国的市场份额。	AGOA had a sunset clause, but if the duty-free access becomes permanent for less developed countries in Africa – as stipulated in Hong Kong – then poor countries in Asia will continue to lose US market share.
认为更少的人活得更长更好的一个原因是，只有被生出来的人才知道剥夺生命意味着什么；本不存在的人不会知道他们失去了什么。	One reason for thinking it better to have fewer people living longer lives is that only those who are born know what death deprives them of; those who do not exist cannot know what they are missing.
在过去一周里，安倍为自己创造很大的以战略合作伙伴身份施展的政治空间 — — 不仅是对印度，也包括日本的其他盟国，特别是美国。	In the past week, Abe created for himself considerably more political space to act as a strategic partner, not only to India, but also to Japan’s other allies, particularly the United States.
比如说，伏马菌素（fumonisin）以及其他真菌都拥有极强毒性，不但会使人类罹患食道癌，还能令其他食用玉米的牲畜患上致命性疾病。	For example, fumonisin and some other fungal toxins are highly toxic, causing esophageal cancer in humans and fatal diseases in livestock that eat infected corn.
如果说失业率并没有维持在“大萧条”时期的水平，但也高得足以使长期失业或对长期失业的恐惧成为一种刻骨铭心的经历。	If unemployment was not stuck quite at Great Depression levels, it remained high enough to make long-term joblessness or the fear of long-term joblessness a defining experience.
最近的事件进一步削弱了俄罗斯国内亲西方的市场派，强化了国家资本主义和民族主义派，后两者正在试图加快欧亚联盟的建立。	Recent events have further weakened market-oriented, Western-leaning factions in Russia and strengthened the state-capitalist, nationalist factions, who are now pushing for faster establishment of the EAU.
此外，人均欧盟生产率 — — 在1995年之前的20年中，欧洲的这一指标一直在向美国靠拢，到1995年时只比美国低5 % — —在欧元区危机前的十年中相对美国下降了10个百分点。	Furthermore, per capita EU productivity, which had been converging on the US level for 20 years up to 1995, when Europe was only about 5% below the US, lost ten percentage points in relative terms in the decade preceding the eurozone crisis.
在19世纪晚期诸如“牛肉、肱二头肌和薄伽梵歌”等口号的激励下，国民志愿团模仿欧洲法西斯向身着卡其色的军服的印度教年轻人灌输他们自己的军事纪律理想。	Inspired by late-nineteenth-century slogans such as “Beef, Biceps, and the Bhagavad Gita,” the RSS emulated European fascists by instilling their own ideals of military discipline in young Hindus in khaki uniforms.
事实上，我们的一次性经济的后果 — — 如二氧化碳排放量的高企、难以管理的废品潮和越来越难以提取资源等 — — 已经显露无疑。	Indeed, the consequences of our disposable economy – skyrocketing CO2 emissions, unmanageable waste streams, and the increasing difficulty of extracting resources, to name a few – are already apparent.
受国外金主的慷慨支持，近几年来沙拉菲派原教旨主义 — — 一个偏隘的伊斯兰教流派，与几百年来在印度大量存在的更温和的苏菲派变体大相径庭 — — 正在孟加拉国蔓延。	Backed by lavish financing from abroad, Salafist fundamentalism – an intolerant version of Islam at odds with the more moderate Sufi-influenced variant that prevailed in India for centuries – has been spreading across Bangladesh in recent years.
比如，当牧师离开“圣职”时，他们便“退回世俗状态 ” — —有居高临下之嫌的专用词，天主教的顽固不化可见一斑。	For example, when priests leave “holy orders,” they are “reduced to the lay state” – a bit of condescending terminology that says a lot about the Church’s archaic mindset.
因此蓬佩奥有理由担心他在秘密会谈中的所见所闻会遭泄露，并反过来破坏峰会并夺走政府即将到手的政治胜利。	Thus, it was reasonable for Pompeo to fear that knowledge of his secret talks would be leaked in an effort to undermine the summit and deny the administration a potential political victory.
分歧不可避免，但让欧洲保持静止，抑或有时以不同的步伐让开放的欧洲不断前进，究竟哪一个才是更好的选择？	There will be disagreement, but is it better to have a static Europe or a Europe that advances, sometimes at different paces, and that is open to all?
华盛顿 — — 印度正面临多年来最严重的水资源危机，约有3亿3000万人（占全国人口的1/4）面临严重干旱的影响。	WASHINGTON, DC – India is currently facing its worst water crisis in years, with an estimated 330 million people – one-quarter of its population – affected by severe drought.
6月以来上证指数两位数的下跌之所以没有引起经济危机，主要是因为只有不到10%的中国家庭参与了股市，而股票只占家庭资产的不到15 % 。	The double-digit drop in the Shanghai Composite Index since June has not triggered an economic crisis largely because fewer than 10% of Chinese households participate in the stock market, and equities comprise less than 15% of household assets.
有时我们被邀请提早出席，希望我们能在官方代表到来之前就提早离开，这种方法有时管用，有时也会发生意外。	Or we were invited to come at an earlier hour in the hope that we would leave before the official representatives arrived, which sometimes worked and sometimes didn’t.
这是重要的，因为欧洲对俄国的一贯政策是欧洲面临的关键而又急迫的挑战之一，这一政策取决于波兰和德国之间的紧密合作。	This is important because a consistent European policy toward Russia – one of the key urgent challenges facing Europe – depends on close cooperation between Poland and Germany.
而这也是为什么我们呼吁实施一些额外手段去加强伊朗政治变革的前景，催生一个准备与人民和邻国和平共处的伊朗政府。	This is why additional measures are called for to improve the prospects for political change that brings about an Iranian government prepared to live in peace with its own people and its neighbors.
专家试图让美国人了解埃博拉传播有多么困难，以及埃博拉为何不可能在美国形成流行之势，但人们往往充耳不闻。	Experts’ attempts to impress upon Americans how difficult Ebola is to transmit, and how unlikely an Ebola epidemic in the US was, fell largely on deaf ears.
巴西最近登上了国际新闻的头版头条，但却不是因为城市暴力、自然灾害、政治腐败或亚马逊地区森林砍伐等传统的报导。	RIO DE JANEIRO – Brazil has been making international headlines of late, but not for traditional stories about urban violence, natural catastrophes, political corruption, or deforestation in the Amazon.
是的，民主党总统候选人伯尔尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sandees）说丹麦是理想的居住地，它做对了很多事。	Yes, Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was right that Denmark is a great place to live and does many things right.
俄罗斯与包括土耳其这个北约成员国在内的所有主要地区大国的一唱一和，证明了克里姆林宫外交政策的活力（以及利益导向 ） 。	Russia’s coordination with all major regional powers – including Turkey, a NATO member – attests to the dynamism (and cynicism) of the Kremlin’s foreign policy.
发自拉古纳海滩 — — 在高涨的期望和球迷汹涌澎湃的热情支持下，埃及国家男子足球队在时隔28年后再次入围世界杯决赛圈。	LAGUNA BEACH – Egypt’s national soccer team rode to Russia for their first World Cup finals in 28 years on a wave of lofty expectations and potent fan enthusiasm.
投资者认为这些风险或许不会升级，或者发达经济体的宽松货币政策和持续复苏能够遏制这些风险，这也许是对的。	Investors may be right that these risks will not materialize in their more severe form, or that loose monetary policies in advanced economies and continued recovery will contain such risks.
一部分 ， “ 记忆的丰富遗产”是植根于过去。 而另一部分，与现在相关并通往未来，是以公民共同建造公共生活的普遍意愿为构成要素的。	One part, the “rich inheritance of memories,” is rooted in the past, while the other, related to the present and opening the way to the future, consists in the common will of citizens to build their public life together.
叶利钦和他们有着共同的目标，但是有一点与他们不同：他认识到了帝制与民主的不相容性，所以愿意放弃苏联而努力在其国内建立民主制度。	Yeltsin aimed for the same goal. But he stands out from them in this respect: he understood that empire was incompatible with democracy, and so was willing to abandon the Soviet Union in order to try to build a democratic order at home.
在现有基础上，数学模型预测植物总共约有350,000种，比目前所知的多出15%左右。 这一数字与专家意见其实不谋而合。	Based on this development, mathematical models predict that roughly 15% more plant species exist than are currently known, for a total of some 350,000 species – a figure that is consistent with expert opinion.
他父亲的梦想被终结了，而他所有的只剩下无主题的实用主义，并成为他执政的鲜明印记，这一点他日后才逐渐认识到。	The dreams from his father were at an end, and he was left, as he only slowly realized, with the themeless pragmatism that has become the hallmark of his administration.
北约对科索沃的干预就是一例，这次事件中，几个政府选择对另一个政府（塞尔维亚）的主权进行干预，目的是阻止种族清洗和屠杀。	The NATO intervention in Kosovo was an example where a number of governments chose to violate the sovereignty of another government (Serbia) to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide.
根据经济学家巴里·艾肯格林（Barry Eichengreen ） 、 朴东炫（Donghyun Park）和康镐炫（Kwanho Shin）的研究，这一比例大约是美国人均收入的60 % （ 以2005年国际价格计算 ） 。	According to the economists Barry Eichengreen, Donghyun Park, and Kwanho Shin, that share is about 60% of America’s per capita income (at 2005 international prices).
当你购买通用汽车的产品时，你所付的每一美元中就有80美分揣进了通用汽车的腰包，而通用汽车公司所做的仅仅是自我管理。	When you buy a car from General Motors, 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM, which mostly only manages itself.
我们希望，在安全共享数据的同时保护隐私的能力能够鼓励个人、公司和政府广泛交流各自的想法，从而提高整个城市的生产率和创造力。	We hope that the ability to share data safely, while protecting privacy, will encourage individuals, companies, and governments to communicate their ideas widely, and so increase productivity and creativity across the entire city.
相反，传统发展经济学家会说，芬兰不应该出口木材；而应该将木材转化为纸和家具，以此获得附加值。 芬兰也这么做了。	By contrast, a traditional development economist would argue that it should not export wood; instead, it should add value by transforming the wood into paper or furniture – something that Finland also does.
10月，劳工部步其后尘，用“澄清”缓解了退休基金关于投资于产生社会和经济两方面回报的初创企业的顾虑。	In October, the Department of Labor followed up with a “clarification’’ that eased worries at pension funds about investing in ventures that produce social as well as economic returns.
在危机四伏的环境下，我们不可低估这一举动对阿根廷以及其他国家的重要性。 其他国家领导人正在密切观察如何应对自身经济困难的线索。	At a time of daunting crisis conditions, one should not underestimate the importance of this move not just for Argentina, but also for other countries, where leaders are watching closely for clues about how to deal with their own economic woes.
而罗姆尼则会重拾奥巴马早年许下的那些尚未兑现的承诺，虽然奥巴马会将罗姆尼称为一个见风使舵的“骑墙派 ” 。	Romney, for his part, will hold up Obama’s early, still-unmet promises, while Obama will call Romney a “flip-flopper” who changes his positions to suit the moment (and the audience).
希腊公民必然认为，如果他们在因为退出欧元区而导致的困难时期继续信任他们的政府，就可以摆脱严重的不公。	Greece’s citizens must believe that they are escaping grave injustice if they are to continue to trust their government during the difficult period that would follow an exit from the eurozone.
而对于开发利用核能资源的新方法，以及解决核废料问题来说，这么一个对强相互作用力的精确理解都将非常意义重大。	A preciseunderstanding of the strong force could be just as important, opening new ways to use nuclear-energy resources while solving the problems of safety and nuclear waste.
有些人会觉得在这个年龄生育孩子有点荒唐，因为大多数妇女在这个年纪已经做了祖母了；但更重要的问题是，如果他们的父母死亡或变得无力抚养他们，这些孩子将得到什么样的照顾呢？	Some will find it grotesque to become a mother at an age when most women are grandmothers, but the more significant question is what kind of care such children will have if their parents die or become incapable of rearing them.
同样，无论对于儿童还是成人，公共图书馆都能带来真正的价值 — — 让所有人拥有世俗和自由的集会空间，在赋予每个人学习机会的同时为他们提供数字化服务。	Likewise, for children and adults alike, there is real value in, say, public libraries – secular and free gathering spaces that offer universal access to learning and, increasingly, provide a gateway to digital services.
这一思想认为，长期而言，参与自由贸易的国家将发现新的增长渠道，失去了某个产业的工作的工人将在另一个产业找到新工作。	Countries that engage in free trade will find new channels for growth in the long run, the thinking goes, and workers who lose their jobs in one industry will find employment in another.
日益增加的球员跨国流动使得各国球技水平走向趋同，这一点从阿根廷、巴西、法国、德国，意大利和西班牙等传统足球强国的统治地位下降上可以看出。	The increased movement of players across borders has already contributed to a convergence among countries’ skill levels, reflected in the declining dominance of traditional powerhouses like Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.
和大部分革命一样，这场革命之所以没有发生，就像赫胥黎（Thomas Huxley）所预言的那样，是因为美妙的旧理论被丑陋的新事实所扼杀。	As with most revolutions, this one is not happening because, as Thomas Huxley surmised, a beautiful old theory has been killed by ugly new facts.
他甚至还更进一步挑明这一指向，批评各国可能抛弃巴黎气候协议的举措 — — 正如特朗普威胁要做的那样。	He was even more pointed in criticizing the prospect of abandoning the Paris climate agreement – as Trump has threatened to do.
这篇评论令那些只看到西方国家 — — 包括特朗普刚刚发表了就职演说的美国 — — 阴暗面的人感到震惊。	The piece came as a surprise to those who saw only bleak prospects for Western countries, not least the United States, where US President Donald Trump had just been inaugurated.
误导性宏观经济政策所赐让该比例继续下降至9 % ， 特别是里根时期，赤字支出和过于紧缩的货币政策导致美元飙升，破坏了竞争力。	That share fell further, to 9% because of misguided macroeconomic policies, especially during the Reagan era, when deficit spending and overly tight monetary policy caused the dollar to soar, undermining competitiveness.
这有一个前提：穆斯林兄弟会实现内部重组并找到办法与走极端路线的派系保持距离，并对脆弱群体和社会少数派推行包容性政策。	This presupposes that the Brothers reorganize themselves internally and find ways to distance themselves from more radical factions, and that they promote inclusive policies toward vulnerable groups and social minorities.
在负责同级的外交部时，他的主要成就是与法国结成紧密联盟并进行大量安全合作 — — 包括在核技术方面的合作。	Running a sort of parallel foreign ministry, his main achievement was the creation of a close alliance and strong security cooperation – including with respect to nuclear technology – with France.
第二个问题是人们为什么会接受极端思想？ 研究和安全人员对此进行了探索，并一致认为感觉受到排斥的人接受极端思想的可能性更大。	The second question – why are some people attracted to radical ideas? – has been explored by researchers and security practitioners, who generally agree that people are more inclined to accept radical ideologies if they feel alienated.
诚然，早在20世纪60年代初，肯尼迪政府成员就开始了战争的理智化，争论战略（包括反动乱战略）的合理性。	To be sure, in the early 1960’s, members of President John F. Kennedy’s administration intellectualized war and debated the merits of strategies, including counterinsurgency.
更重要的是，美国公司并非如同特朗普和国会共和党所声称的那样，是因为税率太高而囤积了数万亿美元现金而拒绝进行资本投资。	More to the point, US corporations aren’t hoarding trillions of dollars in cash and refusing to make capital investments because the tax rate is too high, as Trump and congressional Republicans claim.
列宁的分析也许是错误的，但如今，我们知道，他的结论是正确的，只是正确的原因是另外一个：金融资本主义迫使一国走向不可持续的负债。	Lenin may have gotten the underlying analysis wrong, but today we know that his conclusion may have been right for another reason: financial capitalism forces a country into unsustainable indebtedness.
Des objectifs si ambitieux, aussi irréalistes soient-ils, peuvent provoquer une dynamique de discipline, et pousser certains pays de l’UE à augmenter leurs dépenses, alors même que l’UE a lancé un certain nombre de programmes prometteurs.	Such ambitious goals, however unrealistic, can have a disciplining effect, leading some EU countries to increase their spending, while the EU itself has launched a number of promising schemes.
墨西哥可以利用一系列移民工具，如放松对危地马拉南部边境的控制，或者在美国当局无法证明其墨西哥国籍的情况下拒绝从美国接纳被驱逐者。	Mexico can use a number of tools on immigration, such as loosening controls on its southern border with Guatemala or refusing admission to deportees from the US unless American authorities can corroborate their Mexican nationality.
铁路系统容量有限，公路也只有14%能够畅通。 这并不令人惊奇，因为2000—2011年间巴西的基础设施投资平均只占GDP的2.2 % ， 远低于全球平均水平。	The rail system is limited, and only 14% of roads are paved, which is not surprising, given that Brazil’s investment in infrastructure averaged only 2.2% of GDP in 2000-2011 – well below the global average.
当我在1980年代初加入国际货币基金组织时，与非政府对口机构进行磋商 — — 无论是针对国家还是政策工作 — — 都是不受鼓励的。	When I joined the IMF in the early 1980s, discussions with non-government counterparts, whether on country or policy work, were discouraged. The situation today is very different.
相反，如果一国人均收入比另一国高100 % ， 那么它所接收的商务旅行者将多出130 % ， 它发出的商务旅行者将多出170 % 。	By contrast, a country with a per capita income that is 100% higher than another receives 130% more business travelers and sends 170% more people abroad.
比如，多数由政府主办的难民庇护所并未提供区分性别的浴室和厕所 — — 这对来自保守伊斯兰环境的女性不啻具有灾难性。	For example, most government refugee shelters didn’t provide gender-exclusive toilets and showers – a disaster for women from conservative Islamic backgrounds.
即将履新的特朗普政府必须充分明白，追求可持续性日程的经济和环境利益总和仍将推动各国和各公司朝这个方向努力。	It must be abundantly clear to the incoming administration that the combined economic and environmental interest in pursuing the sustainability agenda will continue to push countries and companies alike in that direction.
在我们了解到推动这些意外变化的因素之前，我们需要注意这些调查结果的呈现方式，以及它们如何为政策制定提供信息。	Until we understand what’s driving these unexpected changes, we need to be mindful of how survey findings are presented, and how they inform policymaking decisions.
两国都有着目空一切的民族主义，都相信自己的力量无法抗拒，而美国因陷入伊拉克和阿富汗战争的泥沼而江河日下更使他们觉得无所畏惧。	Both are marked by a defiant nationalism, and both feel irresistible, all the more so because they sense that the United States is in decline as a result of the quagmire in Iraq, if not in Afghanistan as well.
为了心灵导师所提供的安全，而心甘情愿将妻子和女儿奉献给他的人们，无法明白为何同样的赐予两位女性的“保佑”会让他锒铛入狱。	People who were willing to lend their wives and daughters to their guru, for the sake of the security he offered, could not understand why the same “blessing,” extended to the two girls, should land him in jail.
而现在他拥有了卡钦斯基的支持，并因此深受马切雷维奇和（刚刚实现了对法院直接控制的）司法部长兹比格涅夫·兹波布罗等其他法律与正义党领导人物的妒忌。	And now that he has Kaczyński’s support, he is deeply resented by other leading PiS figures such as Macierewicz and justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who has just assumed direct control of the courts.
“身处全球金融系统核心 ， ” 他说 ， “ 扩大了追寻英国储蓄的机构的投资机会，也增强了英国制造业和创新行业的全球竞争力 。 ”	“Being at the heart of the global financial system,” he said, “broadens the investment opportunities for the institutions that look after British savings, and reinforces the ability of UK manufacturing and creative industries to compete globally.”
保持内部凝聚力的一种方法是创造“恶魔 ” — —这是从二十世纪九十年代阿尔及利亚和二十世纪七八十年代阿根廷的“肮脏战争”中学来的。	And one way to maintain internal cohesion is to create “demons” – a lesson learned from the “dirty wars” in Algeria in the 1990’s and Argentina in the 1970’s and 1980’s.
正如发明这一词汇的约翰•威廉姆森（John Williamson）在2002年所指出的那样，这些措施“是十全十美，万无一失的，因此我们才有必要就此达成共识 。 ”	As John Williamson, who coined the term, put it in 2002, these measures “are motherhood and apple pie, which is why they commanded a consensus.”
欧盟这样做的一个原因是不愿和俄罗斯发生争端。 俄罗斯仍将我们视为其紧密的盟友、自然的贸易伙伴和其领导下的不断扩大的经济区的成员。	One reason for this is that the EU does not want to pick a fight with Russia, which still sees us as its close ally, natural business partner, and as members of an enlarging Russian-led economic zone.
如果这些富裕国家继续只给予那些最贫穷国家一点点的、不足以解决问题的帮助，那么这些最贫穷国家将永远不会摆脱贫困。	If donors keep giving only a little bit of help, but not enough to solve the problems of the poorest countries, these countries will never escape poverty's grip.
举个例子，最初令阿迪提亚纳受到关注的是其煽动性的反穆斯林言论 — — 为此他因煽动宗教紧张的罪名 — — 并领导一队专门袭击穆斯林目标的志愿者 — — 于2007年在监狱里蹲了11天。	Adityanath, for example, first gained attention for his incendiary anti-Muslim speeches – he spent 11 days in jail in 2007 for fomenting religious tension – and for leading a squad of volunteers who specialized in attacking Muslim targets.
考虑到中国净对外贷款头寸高达1.8万亿美元或GDP的17.2 % ， 央行有足够的流动性，不必推出非常规货币政策（极低利率 ） ， 而只需降低银行的准备金率来应对可能的债务危机。	Given that China’s net external lending position amounts to $1.8 trillion, or 17.2% of GDP, the central bank has enough liquidity to reduce banks’ reserve requirements without resorting to unconventional monetary policy.
在爱尔兰逮捕了多位试图谋杀一名将先知默罕默德描绘成一条狗的瑞典卡通画家的所谓圣战者之后，这个问题变得更加紧迫了。	This issue has been given new urgency by the arrests in Ireland of alleged jihadists from several countries who are accused of plotting to murder a Swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet Mohammed as a dog.
所有美国的袭击都发生在偏远的北部，巴基斯坦部落的瓦齐里斯坦地区，尽管阿富汗塔利班及其哈卡尼组织和希克马蒂亚尔组织等盟友没有隐藏在那里。	All of the US strikes have occurred farther north, in Pakistan’s tribal Waziristan region, although the leadership of the Afghan Taliban and of its allied groups, like the Haqqani network and the Hekmatyar band, is not holed up there.
因此，政策着力点必须也放在耶鲁大学政治学家雅各布·哈克（Jacob Hacker）所谓的“前分配 ” （ pre-distribution）上，即改变市场决定的工资收入结构。	The policy focus, therefore, must also be on what Yale University political scientist Jacob Hacker calls “pre-distribution”: changing the market-determined structure of wage incomes.
在六月发布的一份报告中，六家银行汇报了自联合报告开始四年来他们如何提供了超过1000亿美元的气候融资。	In a report released in June, the six banks described how they have provided more than $100 billion in climate finance in the four years since joint reporting began.
这些问题属于错误的二分法，我们可以通过制定扬“和”抑“或”的政策来避免它们，让各种利益都能得到平等的照顾。	Those are all false dichotomies, which we can avoid by developing policies that favor “and” over “or,” allowing all sets of interests to be pursued in parallel.
但更令人忧心的是，曾经有段时期连挪威诺贝尔奖评选委员会都似乎要向北京低头，但委员们最终决定坚持原决议 — — 这才是唯一的正道，因为一个褒扬道德勇气的奖项是不能被其颁发者所妥协和出卖的。	But in the end it decided to go ahead with the award. That is only fitting: an award for moral courage ought not to be compromised by those offering it.
“这个国家的人受够了专家 ， ” 戈夫不耐烦地说，他指的是“来自名字由缩写组成的组织的专家，他们总是说自己知道怎么做最好，但每次都弄错 。 ”	“People in this country have had enough of experts,” Gove testily explained, referring to “experts from organizations with acronyms, saying they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong.”
全球治理往往只是保护既得利益全球计划的代名词，也正因如此，它所起到的主要作用是在推进全球化的同时协调国内经济政策。	Too often, global governance is another name for the pursuit of these interests’ global agenda, which is why it ends up mainly furthering globalization and harmonizing domestic economic policies.
如果没有来自国际社会 — — 特别是和平协定担保国迅速而大胆的确保诺言兑现的行动，我们将会失去这次宝贵的机会。	Without swift and bold action from the international community – particularly from those who guarantee the peace agreement – to ensure that promises are kept, this opportunity will be lost.
但该网站还公开了年轻的穆兄会活跃分子对戈兹兰的立场的批评 — — 对于极少公开内部异见的组织来说，这是一个引人注目的情况。	But it also published harsh criticism of Ghozlan’s position by young Brotherhood activists – a notable development for an organization in which dissent is rarely publicized.
正如一位阿富汗政府官员说的那样 ， “ 如果你不能清除一个腐败的法官，你怎么能够对付塔利班呢 ？ ”	As one senior Afghan government official said, “If you can’t remove a corrupt judge, how can you deal with the Taliban?”
格里洛与北方联盟的马蒂奥·萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）十分相似，他没有什么政治经验，不了解欧洲的历史，没有多少经过提炼的观点，也没有可信的未来愿景。	Grillo – much like Lega Nord’s Matteo Salvini – has scant political experience, little knowledge of European history, few refined arguments, and no credible vision for the future.
《金融时报》最近对美联储副主席斯坦利·费舍尔（Stanley Fischer）的采访相当引人注目，因为它揭露了一些重大分歧。	A remarkable recent interview in the Financial Times with Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer laid bare some major disagreements.
此外征召人们牺牲性命换来的高额战争利润激起了民众的普遍愤怒，导致许多人（且不仅仅是美国人）开始鼓吹“财富征用 ” 。	Moreover, widespread anger over high war profits while men were being conscripted to risk their lives led many people, not just Americans, to start advocating for “wealth conscription.”
此外，两类与能源相关的安全问题也越来越引起人们的担忧：即由能源应用特点所引发的暴力危险与日俱增，以及能源使用的成本居高不下。	Moreover, there is deepening concern about two types of energy-related security problems: the increasing risk of violence stemming from the nature of our energy use, and the high cost of that energy.
类似政府最近收紧信贷这样的狭隘政策将使其难以将金融资源导入实体经济 — — 而这正是李克强经济学的一个重要目标。	Narrow policies like the government’s recent credit tightening will make it difficult to direct financial resources to the real economy – one of the primary objectives of “Likonomics.”
使用这一规则看起来相当合理，如果我们将自己置于被绑架者的处境，或想象我们的孩子、父母或配偶被恐怖分子绑架并且获得交钱放人的可信条件的话。	Applying it can seem justifiable if we put ourselves in the position of a captive, or imagine that our child, parent, or spouse has been captured by terrorists who make a credible offer to release our loved one for a ransom.
高额关税可以破坏市场并限制贸易，恰恰因为企业希望减少他们所缴纳的关税 — — 并因此在全球范围内以相应的方式来分配产能。	Higher tariffs fragment markets and limit trade, precisely because companies want to reduce the taxes they pay – and allocate production accordingly around the world.
考虑一下这种情况。 法国有着欧盟中最高的人口出生率（每个妇女有差不多两个孩子 ） ， 甚至比人口激增的爱尔兰还要高。	Consider this: France has the highest fertility rate in the European Union (just under two children per woman), even ahead of booming Ireland.
最近，哈佛大学心理学家史蒂文·平克（Steven Pinker）出版了一本书，记录了各项福利的长期积极趋势，他称之为“启蒙的成果 ” 。	Recently, the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker published a book documenting long-term positive trends in multiple dimensions of wellbeing, which he calls “the fruits of the Enlightenment.”
但在公开场合发表这样的言论已经不再起作用了。 这倒不是因为罗马尼亚人不认同这样的观点（许多人也这么认为 ） ， 而是从左翼到右翼的政治阶层都想成为欧洲的一部分因而会与任何危及这一愿望的人划清界限。	But saying that publicly won't work anymore, not because Romanians do not think this way (many certainly do), but because the political class from left to right wants to be part of Europe and won't associate with anyone who puts that desire at risk.
技术进步在一个复杂而深度一体化的生态系统赵红发生，这意味着它同时影响着经济结构、政府、安全安排和人们的日常生活。	Technological progress is occurring within a complex and deeply integrated ecosystem, meaning that it simultaneously affects economic structures, governments, security arrangements, and people's daily lives.
提振名义GDP的三大因素 — — 真实产出增加、出口相对价格上涨和实际汇率升值 — — 并不是逐一独立作用的。	The three phenomena that boost nominal GDP – increases in real output, a rise in the relative price of exports, and real exchange-rate appreciation – do not operate independently of one another.
由于许多苏格兰人 — — 其中62％的人投票支持留在欧盟 — — 都非常厌恶在英格兰民族主义的束缚下被英国保守党政府拖入一场硬脱欧进程，苏格兰独立的选项就变得难以抗拒。	With many Scots – 62% of whom voted to remain in the EU – leery of being dragged into a hard Brexit by a Conservative UK government in thrall to English nationalism, the case for Scottish independence could be compelling.
但是通过称之为战争、并把基地组织及其领导人本拉登点名为对手，美国政府给某些国内变化提供了理由。 这些国内变化在9/11袭击之前是不会被任何自由国家所接受的。	By calling them war – and naming an opponent, usually al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden – the United States government has justified domestic changes that, before the 9/11 attacks, would have been unacceptable in any free country.
这样的背信弃义令印度民众作呕，而9月印度人又被迫为再次发生的袭击事件哀悼，那次跨境袭击中某陆军基地的18名士兵因此死亡。	Indians, sickened by this perfidy, found themselves mourning again in September, when another cross-border assault killed 18 soldiers at an Army base in Uri.
为罹患疟疾的孩子寻医问药的家长，为孩子的上学奔波的家长，都必须自掏腰包 — — 这对很多家庭来说成为不可能的任务。	Parents seeking treatment for a malaria-stricken child, or a place for that child in school, must pay from their own pocket – an impossibility for many.
如果从现在开始增加卫生投资，那么到2030年，我们可以大幅接近所有家长都不会因为可预防原因失去孩子 — — 所有孩子也不会因为可预防原因失去一位双亲的目标。	If we increase investments in health now, by 2030 we can be that much closer to a world in which no parent loses a child – and no child loses a parent – to preventable causes.
战略核武器重新成为世界政治的中心议题不仅提升了俄罗斯的政治分量，还把国际社会的目光重新聚焦在了这个俄罗斯依然可以以世界强权自居的领域。	The return of strategic nuclear weapons to the center of world politics increases Russia’s political weight and highlights the field in which Russia can still assert itself as a superpower.
这是在1995年发生的事情，当时货币基金组织开始鼓吹资本性账户的自由化，在亚洲金融危机时候实行过度紧缩银根的财政拯救方案，并试图单枪匹马的扭转亚洲经济。	That is what happened in the second half of the 1990’s, as the IMF began to preach capital-account liberalization, applied over-stringent fiscal remedies during the Asian financial crisis, and single-handedly tried to reshape Asian economies.
在过去十年中至少有20个国家建立了由国家出资赞助的战略投资基金，与私营部门合作伙伴共同投资基础设施项目。	Over the last decade, at least 20 countries have established state-sponsored strategic investment funds to co-invest in infrastructure projects with private-sector partners.
我最近在第五大道上的以马内利会堂 — — 这里堪称纽约最美轮美奂的犹太教堂，也是世界最大的犹太教堂之一 — — 接受了《纽约时报书评 》 （ New York Times Book Review）编辑帕梅拉·保罗（Pamela Paul）的采访。	At Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue, the most beautiful synagogue in New York and one of the largest in the world, I was recently interviewed by Pamela Paul, editor of the New York Times Book Review.
诺贝尔奖获得者、凯恩斯的反对者罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）在2008年承认 ： “ 我猜每个人都是隐藏很深的凯恩斯主义者 。 ”	As the Nobel laureate Robert Lucas, an opponent of Keynes, admitted in 2008: “I guess everyone is a Keynesian in a foxhole.”
）结果表明，只有少数国家的再分配造成了10点以上的基尼系数变化，并且再平衡���动的基尼系数波动如果超过13点，将对增长造成消极影响。	They show that only a handful of countries redistribute enough to make more than a ten-point difference in the coefficient, and that redistribution-fueled swings of more than 13 points do tend to have an adverse effect on growth.
首先，巴西石油和Prominp就具体的技能 — — 比如船坞焊接、管接和石油工程 — — 制定五年期人才规划项目。	First, Petrobras and Prominp develop a five-year personnel projection in specific skill areas, such as shipyard welding, pipefitting, and petroleum engineering.
巴黎—德国财政部长朔伊布勒最近将希腊退出欧元的选项摆上了台面，他希望释放一个信号，即，任何一个成员国都不能免于货币联盟严格纪律的约束。	PARIS – When Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, recently tabled the option of a Greek exit from the euro, he wanted to signal that no member could abstain from the monetary union’s strict disciplines.
由于美国共和党人幼稚的政治固执导致该国政治瘫痪，而欧洲则着眼于确保设计拙劣的欧元计划能够幸存，因而达沃斯会议上最主要的抱怨就是全球领袖的缺失。	With the US politically paralyzed by the Republicans’ infantile political tantrums, and Europe focused on ensuring the survival of the ill-conceived euro project, the lack of global leadership was a major complaint at Davos.
根据中共中央统战部官员徐志涛所说，所谓“噶玛巴（可能）是中国特工或间谍的指控反映出印方对中方一贯持有的不信任态度 。 ”	According to Xu Zhitao, an official at the Chinese Communist Party central committee’s United Front Work Department, the allegation that “the Karmapa [may be] a Chinese agent or spy shows that India is keeping its mistrustful attitude toward China.”
九十年代，冷战刚刚结束后的一个短暂时间，世界看似好像会永久和平，不会受到国力的困扰，这一时代已经一去不复返了。	Gone are the 1990’s, when for a brief moment in the immediate aftermath of the end of the Cold War, the world looked as if it would be permanently peaceful and unconcerned with power.
数十亿消费者将步入各自国家的中产阶级行列，新的社会网络正在演化生成，气候变化也在日益成为全球商业的重要影响因素。	As that happens, billions of consumers will enter these countries’ middle classes, new social networks will evolve, and climate change will become a growing factor in global commerce.
据无党派立场的国会预算办公室（CBO）的测算，美国金融健康也会受到影响，到2027年将产生大约1.214万亿美元的新增赤字。	And, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, America’s financial health will suffer as well, with an estimated $1.214 trillion added to the deficit by 2027.
伯克利 — — 国际货币基金组织总裁克里斯蒂娜•拉加德不久前发出警告：增长放缓的“平庸常态”正摆在世人面前。	BERKELEY – Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, recently warned that the world risks a new “mediocre normal” of slower growth.
CIYOTA是一个位于克扬瓦力（Kyangwali）难民安置营的由年轻人领导的志愿组织。 在尼日利亚，布鲁明·索因卡（Blooming Soyinka）的非洲花朵（Africa Blooms）组织雇用了六位经济困难的残疾工匠，为这些雇员和她们的家庭创造不断改善和教育子女的条件。	In Nigeria, Blooming Soyinka employs a half-dozen economically disadvantaged and disabled artisans at Africa Blooms, creating conditions for those employees and their families to thrive and educate their children.
在关闭关塔纳摩，禁止酷刑之后，我们必须撤销《爱国者法案 》 ， 从而恢复宪法对于毫无法律根据的窃听和监视的约束力。	“After closing Guantánamo Bay and forbidding torture, we must repeal the Patriot Act, thereby restoring the Constitution’s restraints against warrantless wiretapping and surveillance.
作为世界第二大外国直接投资来源地，欧盟有着卓著的影响力，欧洲投资者给项目和地区带来信誉，从而有利于吸引更多投资。	As the world’s second-largest source of foreign direct investment, the EU wields considerable influence, with European investors bringing credibility to projects and regions, thereby serving to attract further investment.
美国的集中财政也使得各州得以在真正的预算平衡状态下运转，只消有相对较小的“雨天”基金予以调节就行了。	The centralized fiscal role in the US also allows all of the individual states to operate with true balanced budgets, modified only by relatively small “rainy day” funds.
实验经济学家发现人们会牺牲自己的资源去惩罚那些作弊者和占便宜的人，并会将此施加于那些永远不会与之发生互动的陌生人身上 — — 一种被称为“利他性惩罚”的行为。	Experimental economists have found that people will sacrifice their own resources to punish cheaters and free riders, and will do this even to anonymous strangers that they will never again interact with – a behavior dubbed “altruistic punishment.”
与此相反，在欧洲人眼中，一些美国人是极端个人主义的代表；在某种程度上，美国式的乐观主义也被解读为难以接受的社会丑闻。	By contrast, when the personal situations of many individual Americans are examined through European eyes, the extreme individualism that constitutes a key part of American optimism translates into an unacceptable social scandal.
对于作为发达国家一员的美国来说，如果削减温室气体排放所导致的高额成本和税收意味着降低经济复苏的速度，那么政府当然也不会接受强加于其身上的大幅减排限额。	The United States, for one, will not accept ceilings that reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions significantly if it means accepting higher costs and taxes that risk slowing economic recovery.
“如果把所有经济学家放到一起 ， ” 萧伯纳曾经做过著名的总结 ， “ 他们不会得到任何结论 。 ”	“If all the economists were laid end to end,” George Bernard Shaw famously quipped, “they would not reach a conclusion.”
当然，新评分标准不仅对企业本身、而且对试图在“拉动”机制和目前的优先药物需求间达成平衡的决策者也非常重要。	And, of course, the new scoring will also be important to the companies themselves, and for policymakers who are trying to strike a balance between “pull” incentives and current priority-drug needs.
伊斯兰世界内部同样存在着阿拉伯人和非阿拉伯人，逊尼派和什叶派，原教旨主义分子和神学温和派人士之间的冲突。	The Islamic world is riven by disputes between Arab and non-Arab, Sunni and Shia, and Salafi extremists and theological moderates.
构建信任进程是为了克服绥靖和强硬政策的局限性：绥靖政策完全取决于朝鲜似有若无的善意，而强硬政策则意味着无情施压。	The trust-building process was formulated to overcome the limitations of both appeasement and hardline policies: while the former depended entirely on the North’s tenuous good faith, the latter implied only relentless pressure.
必须避免做出那些导致空中楼阁计划以及非理性预期的过度乐观估计，因为刚刚摆脱内战的当地政府将无力完成这些项目，当年在危地马拉发生的一切就是一个例子。	Avoid overly optimistic projections that lead to unworkable plans and unreasonable expectations, which the government will not be able to fulfill, as happened in Guatemala, for example, when its civil war ended.
这也意味着，如果希腊可以走出当前的衰退，那么不管按绝对水平还是按占GDP比重计算，其国民债务都将减少。	This also implies that if Greece could escape from its current recession, its national debt would decline, both absolutely and as a share of GDP.
如果公共就业过去三年的增长速度能像乔治·W·布什总统任期时那样与人口的增长速度相等，那么这800,000个新增就业岗位将使失业率维持在7%左右，而不是8.2 % 。	If public employment had grown during the last three years at about the same rate as the population, as it did during George W. Bush’s presidency, the unemployment rate would be around 7% rather than 8.2%, owing to about 800,000 additional jobs.
乌克兰再供款的利率是16 % ， 低于通货膨胀10 % ， 这就意味者乌克兰的年度利率是负10 % 。	Ukraine’s current refinance rate is 16% a year, 10% less than inflation, which means that Ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10% a year.
里德在谈到史蒂夫·努钦（Steve Mnuchin ） — —前高盛执行副总裁 — — 就任财政部长的合适性时正是持有这一观点：	Reed made precisely this point in speaking to the suitability of Steve Mnuchin – a former Goldman Sachs executive vice president – as Treasury Secretary:
当非洲国家发展起来之后，国内状况会得到足够的改善，吸引人才流回祖国，数量大增的流失人才的确实是会回去的，印度、韩国和中国就是明证。	When development has taken off, and conditions have improved sufficiently to attract people back to their homelands, the hugely increased diaspora would indeed return, as they have done in India, South Korea, and China.
1997年，在捷克共和国、匈牙利和波兰正式加入欧盟两年前，欧盟与俄罗斯达成协议 — — 也就是所谓的成立法案 — — 以缓冲由此带来的影响。	In 1997, two years before the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland became full members, the Alliance reached an agreement with Russia – the so-called Founding Act – to cushion the impact.
其中之一是约旦河西岸法塔赫基层组织领导人马尔万·巴尔毫迪，此人现正在以色列监狱中服刑，罪名是领导了2000年爆发的流血叛乱，并直接参与策划多起谋杀以色列平民的事件。	Marwan Barghouti, the leader of Fatah’s grassroots group on the West Bank, is now in an Israeli prison for organizing the bloody uprising that began in 2000, and for direct involvement in planning the killings of many Israeli civilians.
不再梦想欧洲的欧洲人 — — 他们把和平、妥协以及最重要的自由视为理所当然 — — 没有意识到事态的严重性。	Europeans who have stopped dreaming about Europe, who take peace, reconciliation, and above all freedom for granted, do not realize what is at stake.
即便经济学家无法为这种迅速且激进的变革构建出模型，他们也不应该受到谴责，因为这只不过反映了我们当前的知识水平，以及经济学真的非常、非常复杂的现实。	Economists’ inability to model such rapid, radical change should not be taken as a condemnation of the discipline; it is simply a reflection of the state of our knowledge, and of the fact that the economy is really, really complicated.
政策制定者（也许还有金融市场）可能认为中央银行会通过激进的非常规货币政策（这是用来压制短期及长期利率的）来提供足够的桥接功能。	Policymakers (and perhaps financial markets) may have believed that central banks would provide an adequate bridging function through aggressive unconventional monetary policy designed to hold down short- and long-term interest rates.
与此同时，一名盲人人权分子从非法软禁他的家中逃了出来，跑到了美国驻北京大使馆寻求避难，随后在声明自己家人遭到所在地当局威胁后才离开了使馆。	Meanwhile, a blind human-rights activist escapes from illegal house arrest, finds refuge in the United States’ embassy in Beijing, and leaves the compound only after claims that Chinese authorities in his hometown had threatened his family.
如果承诺投入早期阶段的资金能在未来五年内持续到位，那么总额可能达到我们在审查报告中所提议的20亿美元。	If the amount of money that has been pledged for early-stage funding is sustained over the next five years, the total could reach the $2 billion that we recommended in the Review.
首先，先行财政紧缩 — — 不管多么必不可少 — — 在加速经济收缩，因为更高的税收和更低的政府支出和转移支付拉低了可支配收入和总需求。	First, front-loaded fiscal austerity – however necessary – is accelerating the contraction, as higher taxes and lower government spending and transfer payments reduce disposable income and aggregate demand.
比如说，统计人员也在绞尽脑汁地思考如何统计消费者因数字化而实现的质量提升和传递速度加快所带来的益处。	Statisticians struggle, for example, to account for how consumers are benefiting from the increased quality and speed of delivery that often results from digitalization.
现在，美国不应该重复“这与伊斯兰教无关”之类的老生常谈，而应该承认美国已经成为激进伊斯兰与开明伊斯兰和法治之间的战斗的新战场。	Instead of repeating like a broken record that “this has nothing to do with Islam,” it is time to admit that the US has become yet another theater in the battle between the Islam of the radicals and the Islam of enlightenment and the rule of law.
让其接受“政府问责局（Government Accountability Office ） “ 审计”的法案有望在国会两院获得通过。	"Bills subjecting the United States' central bank to “auditing"" by the Government Accountability Office are likely to be passed by both houses of Congress."
几年前，一部俄罗斯电影径直以《1672》为题，直指俄罗斯历史上的动荡年代（Time of Troubles ） ， 当时，领导不力导致俄罗斯受到波兰贵族和资本家的侵略而亡国。	A few years ago, a Russian film simply entitled 1612 evoked the Time of Troubles, when weak leadership caused Russia to be invaded and subverted by insidious Polish aristocrats and capitalists.
机器人时代正在来临，或者它来得不如我们想的那么快；当它真的来临时，机器人把所有人都失业，或者它们会创造和毁掉的一样多的岗位。	The robots are coming, or they’re not coming as fast as we think; when they do come, they’ll put everyone out of work, or they’ll create as many jobs as they destroy.
在网络化的世界中，我们做的每一件事都会影响他人，我们必须学会超越自我意识，追求合作、共创、共同进化和集体智慧。	In a networked world, where everything we do affects others, we must learn to think beyond ourselves, and pursue cooperation, co-creation, co-evolution, and collective intelligence.
今年5月，巴拿马当局扣留了一艘载有磷酸盐的驶往加拿大的船只，这艘船上的磷酸盐是由一家国有摩洛哥企业在在西撒哈拉占领区非法开采的。	This past May, the Panamanian authorities detained a Canada-bound ship carrying phosphates that had been illegally mined by a state-owned Moroccan company in occupied Western Sahara.
��5或10种不同的政府赞助且需要公众竞相购买的基金的突然出现将向市场传达一个讯息，即在这种环境之下，其他人在为资产估值时会使用什么模式。	And the sudden appearance of between five and ten different government-sponsored funds that make public bids for assets will convey information to the markets about what models other people are using to try to value assets in this environment.
确实，尽管前所未有的危机后美联储资产大概翻了三倍到3万亿美元 — — 并可能在未来一年内达到4万亿美元，美国的消费还是前所未有的回落了。	Indeed, notwithstanding an unprecedented post-crisis tripling of Fed assets to roughly $3 trillion – probably on their way to $4 trillion over the next year – US consumers have pulled back as never before.
通过量化宽松实现的激进的货币扩张在欧元区也更加复杂、更具政治正义性，因为作为货币区的欧元区不存在可供中央银行购买的联邦债务。	Aggressive monetary expansion through quantitative easing is also far more complicated and politically contentious in a currency area with no federal debt for the central bank to buy.
大国不可避免地可以做更多的事情来控制经济，因此也就更为受到诱惑实行干预来应对来自既得利益集团的政治压力。	A larger state can inevitably do more to control the economy, and hence is exposed to the costly temptation to intervene in response to political pressure from vested interests.
3年之后，一个以巴基斯坦为基地的恐怖分子团队在印度的金融中心孟买大开杀戒，扼杀了超过160条生命 — — 也扼杀了由此次板球比赛所开创的外交局面。	Three years later, a Pakistan-based terrorist group killed more than 160 people in Mumbai, India’s financial capital – and, with them, the diplomatic opening initiated by cricket.
与此同时，新技术提高了高技能工人的需求，同时降低了低技能工人的需求 — — 这一趋势令高技能和低技能工人之间的工资差距雪上加霜。	Meanwhile, new technologies raise demand for skilled workers, while reducing demand for their less-skilled counterparts – a trend that fuels the expansion of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled.
同样，随着欧盟演进为一个联邦国家，其忠诚的公民会拒绝基于种族亲缘性的民族主义并转而认同联邦宪法的民主原则。	Similarly, as the EU evolved into a federal state, its loyal citizens would reject nationalism based on ethnic affinities and instead identify with the democratic principles of the federation’s constitution.
而近年来，像杰里米·科尔宾这样的政界人士在成为英国工党领袖之前，支持自己的国家退出北约，而退出的理由恰恰是因为北约致力于以武力为手段展开共同防御。	And in recent years, politicians like Jeremy Corbyn, before he became leader of the UK Labour Party, have supported withdrawing their countries from the alliance, precisely because it is committed to using force as a means of mutual defense.
非洲大湖区持续不断的暴力活动已经夺去了数百万民众的生命，究其根源是因为1994年卢旺达的种族灭绝和胡图族难民大批涌入邻国。	The ongoing violence in Africa’s Great Lakes region, which has claimed millions of civilian lives, is rooted in the 1994 Rwanda genocide and the resulting flood of Hutu refugees into neighboring states.
报纸的头条刊登着各种各样的新的就业信息，但这仍然满足不了那些即将步入劳动市场的年轻人的就业需要。 这些消息对那些想要再次获得就业机会的50岁左右的人们来意义并不是很大。	Headlines announcing new hiring – still not enough to keep pace with the number of those who would normally have entered the labor force – meant little to the 50 year olds with little hope of ever holding a job again.
据最新的麦肯锡全球研究所报告，最为数字化的部门 — — 通过数字资产、数字用途和数字劳动力等十八个指标排序 — — 所获得的利润率显著高于传统部门。	According to a recent McKinsey Global Institute report, the most digitized sectors – ranked by 18 metrics on digital assets, digital usage, and digital workforce – enjoy significantly higher profit margins than traditional sectors.
最后，在其任期的第二年，奥巴马必须“设定更高的目标 ” — — 如同他去年夏天在全美有色人种协进会（ NAACP ）的一次演讲中所言。	Finally, in his second year, Obama must, as he put it last summer in a speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), “aim higher.”
悲哀的是，目前只有科威特和迪拜开始允许PPP，而只有沙特阿拉伯想要私有化机场（Jeddah和Dammam ） 。	Sadly, only Kuwait and Dubai have so far moved to allow PPPs, while only Saudi Arabia intends to privatize airports (Jeddah and Dammam).
在单一货币实施的第一个十年里，私人投资者相信所有欧元区主权债券一样安全，这使得外围国的利率也十分低，尽管其政府存在巨大的赤字，积累了巨额债务。	During the single currency’s first decade, private investors’ belief in the equality of all eurozone sovereign bonds kept interest rates low in the peripheral countries, even as their governments ran up large deficits and accumulated massive debt.
据医学研究所（Institute of Medicine）估计，光是在美国，每年就有7,500亿美元 — — 约占医疗总支出的30 % — —被“浪费在不必要的服务、过高的行政成本、欺诈和其他问题上 。 ”	The Institute of Medicine estimates that in the United States alone, some $750 billion a year – about 30% of total health-care spending – is “wasted on unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud, and other problems.”
乌克兰反对派团体致力于建立一个同普京总统领导之下的俄国截然不同的市民社会以及健康的政党，为此可谓历经万难。	Against all odds, Ukraine's opposition groups have helped forge a civil society and healthy political parties far beyond anything seen in President Vladimir Putin's Russia.
英格兰银行货币政策委员会的投票制度决定了其行长比较难以获知什么时候会出现大部分人支持紧缩的情况，而一些成员的观点，在最近几个月中左右摇摆。	The voting system used by the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee makes it harder for the governor to know when a majority for tightening will emerge, and some members’ views have been oscillating in recent months.
各国政府需要采取行动保护现有生态系统，恢复和扩大遭到破坏的生态系统 — — 并且以以人为本的方式实现。	Governments will need to take action to conserve existing ecosystems – and restore and expand degraded ecosystems – in people-friendly ways.
鉴于美韩两国对反映朝鲜核进展的情报做出了相同的评估，更不用说韩国在面临核威胁时表现出来的脆弱性，两国未能达成实际协议的确是非常令人不安的结果。	Given that the US and South Korea have the same assessment of the intelligence regarding North Korea’s nuclear progress, not to mention South Korea’s vulnerability, their failure to reach a practical agreement is troubling.
尽管2017年的美国陷入了深度分裂，但美国人民仍然对民主的核心原则坚定不移：自由、公平、定期的选举以及对政治、宗教和经济自由的保护。	Although America in 2017 is deeply divided, Americans remain committed to the central tenets of democracy: free, fair, and regular elections and the protection of political, religious, and economic liberty.
为了证明这不仅仅是一种理论假设，巩固财政的支持者举出20世纪80年代前期的丹麦、80年代后期的爱尔兰和20世纪90年代的芬兰作为例证。	As evidence that this is not merely a hypothetical possibility, advocates of fiscal consolidation point to cases like Denmark in the early 1980’s, Ireland in the late 1980’s, and Finland in the 1990’s.
许多人似乎认为，仅仅由于在过去十年中美国经济增长快于欧洲和日本，因而在以后的二十年里也是如此。 这一观点不可思议。	It is curious how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years simply because it has done so for the past ten years.
此外，那些发出“分裂”警告的人都忽视了一个事实：欧盟以及货币联盟的构建一直以来都是以不同的速度在推进。	Moreover, alarmist talk of a “split” overlooks the reality that the EU and the monetary union have long been moving at different speeds.
托克维尔的噩梦还没有在美国的现实中出现，但俄罗斯、土耳其、匈牙利（也许还有波兰）的情况已经与此不远。	De Tocqueville’s nightmare is not yet the reality in the US, but it is close to what we see in Russia, Turkey, Hungary, and perhaps Poland.
眼看着自己与萨利赫的关系逐渐恶化而自身的影响力日渐衰微，阿赫玛尔意识到自己对萨利赫的忠诚已经成为了一种负担。	His relationship with Saleh frayed and his influence waning, al-Ahmar understood that his loyalty to Saleh had become a liability.
而波兰新任欧洲事务部长西曼斯基（Konrad Szymanski）在巴黎袭击发生不到24小时就用该事件指责欧洲的缺陷。	And Poland’s new European affairs minister, Konrad Szymanski, did not wait 24 hours after the Paris attacks before using them to denounce Europe’s flaws.
联合国儿童基金会报告，只要采取用肥皂洗手等简单的措施，就能让腹泻和呼吸系统感染发病率分别降低40%和25 % 。	UNICEF reports that something as simple as hand washing with soap can cut rates of diarrhea and respiratory infections by more than 40% and 25%, respectively.
它还将带来巨大的经济增长，或许会让欧盟GDP增加120亿欧元（合127亿美元 ） ， 同时支持双方的商品和服务贸易增长近25 % 。	It will also provide a substantial economic boost, possibly adding around €12 billion ($12.7 billion) to the EU’s GDP, while underpinning a nearly 25% increase in the trade of goods and services for both sides.
这有利于增加基础设施投资，如若增幅能达到GDP的1 % ， 则可以让印度增加340万个工作岗位，美国增加150万个，巴西增加130万个，印度尼西亚增加700,000个。	This would facilitate higher infrastructure investment, with an increase equivalent to 1% of GDP translating into an additional 3.4 million jobs in India, 1.5 million in the United States, 1.3 million in Brazil, and 700,000 in Indonesia.
乐观者会说，这是与其说是因为厌恶布鲁塞尔或斯特拉斯堡本身，毋宁说是因为公众结成了一个“更加欧洲”的联盟，它有一个技术官僚的重点：单一市场和缺少有吸引力的替代模式。	Optimists might say that this is due less to aversion to Brussels or Strasbourg per se than to the public’s association of “more Europe” with a technocratic focus on the single market and the absence of an appealing alternative model.
首先，美国的干预在过去十年里耗费了数万亿美元和数千条人命，却一直在动摇中东，给受影响国家造成了巨大灾难。	First, US interventions, which have cost the country trillions of dollars and thousands of lives over the past decade, have consistently destabilized the Middle East, while causing massive suffering in the affected countries.
欧洲铁路交通管理系统（European Rail Traffic Management System）克服了不同成员国之间安全和安保标准不一致的问题，建立了一个统一的系统。 这只是这一创新性战略所促成的诸多成功例子中的一个。	The European Rail Traffic Management System, which has overcome divergent safety and security standards among member states to create a unified system, is but one of the many successes that this innovative strategy has facilitated.
非理性繁荣的参与者根本没想过如果当局出手维持经济以及信贷流（或者在极端情况下援助银行或者企业）后自己收回多少。	The irrationally exuberant were not thinking of the returns they would garner if the authorities intervened to maintain the economy and the flow of credit (or, in extreme cases, moved to bail out their bank or enterprise).
第一个认为所有真相都是相对的以及所有信息都是一种反映了社会权力关系的宣传的那个人，早已被桑托勒姆及其支持者们排除在了自己的世界之外。	The first people to argue that all truth is relative, and that all information is a form of propaganda that reflects society’s power relations, were far removed from the world inhabited by Santorum and his supporters.
但另外一项远没有那么稳定的世界纪录归属于北极冰本身：截至今年3月，北极冰已经缩减到有记录以来的最小规模。	But another record, this one far less stable, belongs to the Arctic ice itself: by March of this year, it had shrunk to the smallest size ever recorded.
本阿里的女婿 萨克赫尔·马泰（ Sakhr el-Materi ）去年通过选举进入了执政的宪政民主联盟党中央委员会。	Ben Ali’s son-in-law, Sakhr el-Materi, was last year elected to the central committee of the ruling Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique party.

悲观主义者认为增长将变得更为困难和昂贵；乐观主义者则认为这一定律将随着芯片向3D阵列发展而继续有效。	The pessimists claim that this is becoming harder and more expensive; the optimists hold that the law will remain valid, with chips moving to three dimensions.
更强的信号 — — 比如取消或中止南溪（South Stream）输气管道协议、武器贸易禁令或者双管齐下的选择应该得到认真考虑。	Stronger signals, such as cancellation or suspension of agreements concerning the South Stream gas pipeline and a trade embargo on arms and dual-use items, merit serious consideration.

这对于一位伊朗立法者Akbar Alami而言是难以接受的，他曾公开质疑艾哈迈迪内贾德的看法，认为即便是伊斯兰最神圣的人物也从未做过这种声明。	This proved too much for one Iranian legislator, Akbar Alami, who publicly questioned Ahmadinejad’s judgment, saying that even Islam’s holiest figures have never made such claims.
这正是为何美国支持这些国家在国际货币基金组织，20国集团，亚太经合组织等国际机构承担更大作用是如此重要。	That is precisely why it is so important that the US support a greater role for these countries in international institutions such as the IMF, the G-20, and APEC.

他在战斗中的勇敢证明了他的爱国、勇气和坚定，但在他的职业生涯中，却时常表现出判断力的极度匮乏的弊病。	His bravery in combat attests to his patriotism, courage, and toughness, but his judgment has been found sorely lacking time and time again over his career.
如果我们禁止在奥林匹克运动会上服用兴奋剂，那么我们就应该负起责任，奉劝运动员不要做这种傻事、对运动员进行严格检测、并惩罚那些服用了兴奋剂的运动员。	If we prohibit drugs in the Olympic Games, we owe it to the athletes to deter, detect, and punish those who cheat.

对机器人的适度税收，即便是仅仅减缓这类破坏性技术推广的临时税，似乎是一项旨在解决日益严重不平等现象的政策的天然组件。	A moderate tax on robots, even a temporary tax that merely slows the adoption of disruptive technology, seems a natural component of a policy to address rising inequality.
《纽约时报》和《华盛顿邮报》上的报道与直接面向千百万人、在党派电台和电视节目上反复播出的总统的推特比起来根本没有那么重要了。	What appears in The New York Times or the Washington Post matters less than presidential tweets that go straight to millions of people and are echoed in partisan radio or TV shows.

中国是美国国债最大的外国持有者，美国、欧洲、拉丁美洲和澳大利亚的主要贸易伙伴，也是内亚贸易的关键推动者，这部分是因为其巨大的加工贸易规模。	China is the largest foreign holder of US Treasury securities, a major trade partner for the US, Europe, Latin America, and Australia, and a key facilitator of intra-Asian trade, owing partly to the scale of its processing trade.
首先，在过去四十年中塑造了多项经济政策的简单化新自由市场原教旨主义理论是存在严重误导性的，而GDP的增长正是以不平等状况的恶化为代价。	The simplistic neo-liberal market-fundamentalist theories that have shaped so much economic policy during the last four decades are badly misleading, with GDP growth coming at the price of soaring inequality.
类似地，俄罗斯总统普京不再有事实或罪恶的负担，利用国内和国际群众根深蒂固的怨气和不安全感，为其乌克兰政策营造强大的支持声浪。	Likewise, Russian President Vladimir Putin, unburdened by facts or guilt, has taken advantage of domestic and international audiences’ deep-seated resentments and insecurities to craft compelling narratives in support of his policy toward Ukraine.
人们在20世纪60年代创设特别提款权时，就是希望创设这种信用货币，而建立新的国际储备体系的过程必须通过将特别提款权转换成这种全球货币的方式来完成。	This is what was hoped for when SDRs were created in the 1960’s, and this process must be completed by transforming the SDRs into such a global currency.
小泉在这些改革中取得了实质性的成功，使得被假公济私的自民党政客、官僚和商业巨头把持的、运转不灵的日本政府发生了重大转变。	Koizumi had real successes in these reform efforts, which significantly transformed a malfunctioning Japanese state that was in the grip of pork-barrel LDP politicians, bureaucrats, and big business elites.

而且，这一制度体系应能确保政府履行其职责：捍卫公平、坚定透明地执行法律、让最强大竞争者获取应得收益。	Such a PRI would ensure that the state fulfills its responsibility to safeguard justice, enforce the law firmly and transparently, and enable the strongest competitors to reap their just rewards.
世界银行可以更加直截了当地寻求股东批准特别机制 — — “拖欠前清算拨款 ” （ pre-arrears clearance grant ） — —从而让索马里得到IDA融资。	More immediately, the World Bank could seek its shareholders’ approval for a special mechanism – a “pre-arrears clearance grant” – that would enable Somalia to receive IDA financing.

尽管如此，这已经成为眼下最紧迫的宏观经济问题，不但是因为2000年以来家庭和政府债务不断上升，也是因为 — — 也更重要地 — — 政府债务正在引起过多担忧。	Nonetheless, this has become the most urgent macroeconomic question of the moment, owing not just to spiraling household and government debt since 2000, but also – and more important – to the excess concern that government debt is now eliciting.
对美国而言，俄罗斯同样是一个邪恶帝国，是一个共产扩张主义的世界和一个超级核大国，但同时也是科学、精神和灵魂的摇篮。	For America, Russia, too, was an evil empire, the world of communist expansionism and a nuclear superpower, but also a cradle of science, spirit, and soul.

此外，这还需要将制定经济政策的任务委托给那些跨国机构里的技术官僚，这些人完全与政治绝缘 — — 而这一立场又严重限制了民主以及政治问责制度的作用。	Moreover, it would require entrusting economic policy to international technocrats, insulated as they are from the push and pull of politics – a stance that severely circumscribes democracy and political accountability.
真实GDP增长在1998—1999年期间暂时性地下降到7.7 % ， 但在随后的十年中又再次升高到10.3 % 。	Real GDP growth slowed temporarily, to 7.7% in 1998-1999, before reaccelerating to 10.3% in the subsequent decade.

而当弗拉基米尔·普京重新把决定俄罗斯政治和公共事务的大权集中在克里姆林宫的宫墙之内时，他的首要考虑则是如何把各方对他手中中央权力的挑战最小化。	As he revived centralized Kremlin control over Russian politics and public affairs, Vladimir Putin has been concerned primarily with minimizing challenges to state power, which he concentrated in his own hands.
另一些人则关注特朗普作为一个局外人的魅力，竟能够以一种其对手 — — 近乎无懈可击的圈内人前国务卿希拉里 — — 永远不可能做到的方式来搅乱整个政治体系。	Others focus on Trump’s appeal as an outsider, capable of disrupting the political system in a way that his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton – a consummate insider – never could.

寻租 — — 即富贵精英把资源分配给自己、扼杀其他阶层成功机会的能力 — — 毫无例外地会导致竞争性不足的市场和萎靡的增长。	Rent-seeking, the ability of entrenched elites to allocate resources to themselves and smother opportunity for others, invariably leads to a less competitive market and lower growth.
有些欧洲国家的政府，特别是巴黎和伦敦，也可能存在将哈马斯纳入巴勒斯坦政治的压力 — — 在巴黎和伦敦，有人甚至在战争爆发前就表示反对孤立哈马斯。	Pressure to integrate Hamas into Palestinian politics is also likely in some European capitals, particularly Paris and London, where some expressed opposition to isolating Hamas even before the war.
例如，在2015年，国有的俄罗斯国家电视一台（Rossiya 1）所播出的一部纪录片指责人权活动人士库特波娃犯有工业间谍罪，这样的谎言最终导致她被迫流亡。	For example, in 2015, a documentary that aired on state-owned Rossiya 1 accused human-rights activist Nadezhda Kutepova of “industrial espionage,” lies that eventually forced her into exile.

进入劳务市场的人数要比同时期的退出人数高200，000到300，000¾而移民还未被计算在内，虽然近年来的移民数量有所减少，但仍然是寻找工作的主要力量。	In France, by contrast, 200,000 to 300,000 more people enter the labor market than leave it in each generation – and this does not include immigration, which, although slowing recently, represents a large number of job seekers.
专注一其中一个部分（比如可贸易部门的竞争力问题）而排除另一个（也许是严重的不可贸易需求短缺或绝对生产率停滞不前）是不够的。	Focusing on one (say, the competitiveness problem in the tradable sector) to the exclusion of the other (perhaps a serious non-tradable demand shortfall or stagnant absolute productivity) will not be enough.
借用法兰西共和国的信条“自由、平等、博爱 ” ， 其中的首要原则自由成为1989年柏林墙倒塌后我们这个时代的座右铭；而今天随着经济状况的摇摇欲坠，排在第二位的“平等”正在得到越来越多的重视。	In terms of the French Republic’s credo, “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,” the first principle, liberty, became the motto of our age after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989; the second is gaining greater precedence today as the economy falters.
如果这种令人不满意的发展再持续15 到 20年，墨西哥就会变成一个像葡萄牙、希腊或波兰这样的下层中产阶级国家。	Given 15 to 20 more years of this unsatisfactory progress, Mexico will become a lower-middle class country like Portugal, Greece, or Poland.
但如今大部分公众看到的却是在同一批精英们掌控下的大银行和大国政府，是这些人制造了危机，却又巧立名目用纳税人的钱去拯救那些银行。	Today, by contrast, broad segments of the public see the big banks and big government as being run by the same elites who created the crisis, and then spent public money under one guise or another bailing the banks out.

布什总统不久前任命的美国驻联合国大使，激进的反联合国外交家约翰·博尔顿所提出的战略引起了人们的广泛关注，这种关注也确实恰如其分。	A great deal of attention has been paid to the stratagems of John Bolton, the fiercely anti-UN diplomat whom President Bush recently appointed US ambassador to the UN, and rightly so.
叙利亚不是利比亚，而且现在的政治环境也有了显著的变化 — — 美国总统大选近在眼前，欧洲又面临着日益恶化的经济危机。	Syria is not Libya, and the political context has changed significantly, with America’s presidential election approaching and a deepening economic crisis in Europe.

法国前外长于贝尔·韦德里纳（Hubert Vedrine）最近估算说只有15~20％的欧洲人是亲欧派，还有15~20％的人一贯反对欧盟，剩下的60％是“欧元过敏症患者 ” — —这一描述虽然粗略，但还算公允。	As Hubert Vedrine, a former French foreign minister, recently estimated that only 15-20% of Europeans are Europhiles, another 15-20% oppose the EU outright, and the remaining 60% are “euro-allergic.” It is a rough but fair portrait.
因此，当日后危机来袭时，金融稳定论坛表现得有待加强，2009年二十国集团政府决定采取更严格的模式 — — 金融稳定委员会（Financial Stability Board ） 。	So when the next crisis hit, the FSF was found wanting, and in 2009 the G-20 governments decided that a tougher model was needed – the Financial Stability Board.

只要人人影响平等，甘愿接受现状的心态让日本安然度过了二十年的通缩，民众并没有因为当局始终无法解决通缩问题而怨声载道。	This willingness to accept a situation, however bad, as long as it affects everyone equally is what enabled Japan to endure two decades of deflation, without a public outcry over the authorities' repeated failure to redress it.
而我们也不能排除，星期天最突出的统计数字（57 % ！ ）不仅仅意味着行将就木的昨天的政治机器（它们明天可能再度崛起的民粹主义政党）最后的苟延残喘。	And we cannot rule out that Sunday’s most salient statistic (that 57%!) signifies not only the last gasp of the supine corpses that had been yesterday’s political apparatus (and that may rise again to become tomorrow’s populist parties).
事实上，当年是伊朗第一个提出让卡尔扎伊领导新成立阿富��政府，而且在2002年初的第一个阿富汗捐助国会议上，哈塔米政府还承诺在5年内为阿富汗提供5.6亿美元的援助。	Indeed, it was Iran that first suggested that Karzai lead the newly formed Afghan government, and Khatami’s government pledged $560 million in assistance over five years at the first donor conference for Afghanistan in early 2002.
许多这样的冒险都会以失败告终；但是 — — 特别是在美国 — — 这些股权融资的快速成长公司备受推崇。	Many such ventures do not pan out; but – particularly in the United States – such equity-financed rapid-growth companies are strongly encouraged.
但梵蒂冈银行又称为宗教工作研究所（Institute for Works of Religion ） ， 它成立于1942年，并无多深的天主教根基。	But the bank known as the Institute for Works of Religion, founded in 1942, does not have deep roots in Catholicism.
对台军售，藏独势力以及各类“颜色革命”都是美国以及其他西方势力背后资助的，而且唯一例外是为了削弱中国。	Arms sales to Taiwan, Tibetan activism, and “color revolutions” of various kinds are all sponsored by the US and other Western powers, and are aimed at weakening China.
但是，作为欧洲对其最重要的邻邦政策的一个重要组成部分，巴塞罗那进程的成功是有限的：一个好主意要实行起来有点困难。	But, as a significant component of Europe’s policy toward its most crucial neighbors, the successes of the Barcelona Process were modest: a great idea on the launch pad had difficulty getting off the ground.
在十九世纪，大部分地缘政治对手都围绕着谁能控制被摇摇欲坠的奥斯曼帝国统治的土地这一“东方问题”展开。	In the nineteenth century, much of geopolitical rivalry revolved around the “Eastern Question” of who would control the area ruled by the crumbling Ottoman Empire.
囿于现金的朝鲜可能向出价最高者兜售核武器，买家可能是恐怖组织，也可能是同样认为自己需要这一终极武器的国家。	A cash-strapped North Korea might be tempted to sell nuclear arms to the highest bidder, be it a terrorist group or some country that decided that it, too, needed the ultimate weapon.
而8国的另外4个¾斯洛文尼亚、波兰、立陶宛和斯洛伐克¾都具备直选总统，但从政治和宪法的角度却没有一个能与库奇马领导的乌克兰相媲美。	The other four - Slovenia, Poland, Lithuania, and Slovakia - have directly elected presidents, but none comes constitutionally and politically close to Kuchma's Ukraine.
如果他接受了这一方案，那么将使乌克兰这个渴望成为欧盟成员国并且现在正在与欧盟谈判自由贸易协定的国家获得它所需要的稳定、高效和民主的政府。	If accepted, it promises Ukraine, which aspires to EU membership and is currently negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with the Union, the stable, effective, and democratic government that it needs.
不管英国脱欧和美国大选结果如何，很有可能西方民主国家政府将对选民的焦虑做出反应，采取回归某种程度的保护主义的措施。	Regardless of how Brexit or the US election plays out, it is very likely that governments in Western democracies will respond to voter angst and take measures that imply a return to some degree of protectionism.
我们需要小心（比如）人口增长和消费水平的代际后果，也要小心我们如何对待自己将影响我们子辈和孙辈的生活方式的机会。	We need to be aware for example, that population growth and rising consumption levels have intergenerational consequences, and that how we conduct ourselves will affect the lifestyles and opportunities of our children and grandchildren.
但在中国，国家主席习近平邀请美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在北京故宫举行国宴打破了克里姆林宫期待与中国深化伙伴关系的期望 — — 这样一种礼遇任何苏联或俄罗斯领导人都从未享受过。	But the Kremlin’s hope of a deeper partnership with China was dashed when Chinese President Xi Jinping invited US President Donald Trump to a state dinner in Beijing’s Forbidden City – an honor never extended to a Soviet or Russian leader.
欧洲领导人必须寻求有控制地分割欧元区，最具竞争力的国家 — — 奥地利、芬兰、德国和荷兰 — — 应该采用新货币“北欧元 ” 。	Europe’s leaders must pursue a controlled segmentation of the eurozone, in which the most competitive countries – Austria, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands – adopt a new currency, the “northern euro.”
冷战的结束也终结了美国支持背后的外交政策逻辑，而贸易和投资的日益全球化让支持发展中国家不再是扩大市场的必要手段。	The end of the Cold War undercut the foreign-policy logic behind America’s backing, as increasing globalization of trade and investment made economic support for developing countries seem less necessary as a way to expand markets.
想想非洲，非洲联盟在解决大陆上的争端中正发挥着领导作用，并且越来越坚定地介入和制止侵略，确保对非洲少数民族公平。	Consider Africa, where the African Union is taking a leading role in resolving conflicts on the continent and is increasingly determined to intervene to halt aggression and assure fair play for African minorities.
这些情绪 — — 加之法国政府在促进民族认同和经济发展方面的历史作用 — — 已经导致对国民阵线的支持率激增。	These sentiments – together with the French state’s historical role in fostering national identity and economic growth – have contributed to a surge in support for the National Front.
和戴维·弗罗姆金所写的1914年的德国一样，布什政府把伊拉克战争描述为一场反恐战争 - - 即使伊拉克与恐怖袭击美国毫无关系 - - 以此来操纵美国公众舆论，博得公众的支持。	Just as Fromkin shows with regard to Germany in 1914, the Bush administration manipulated US public opinion to support the Iraq War as a war on terror, even though Iraq had nothing to do with any terrorist attack against the US.
中国需要用上述结构性改革带来的改革红利，包括市场活力和整体经济稳定性增长，来抵消GDP增速放缓的改革成本。	The deceleration in GDP growth that such reforms would cause would be more than offset by increased market dynamism and overall economic stability.
其第五版评估报告围绕“负排放”的概念 — — 即吸收大气中的过多二氧化碳的能力 — — 构建了实现巴黎气候目标的情景。	In its fifth assessment report, it builds its scenarios for meeting the Paris climate goals around the concept of “negative emissions” – that is, the ability to suck excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
欧盟边境管理局、欧盟边防局（Frontex）已经启动名为海卫行动的有限海岸救援计划，以部分弥补地中海救援行动停止后的空缺。	In its place, the EU border agency, Frontex, has begun conducting a limited coastal mission called Operation Triton.
我们也不要忘记，中国还持有大量美国国债，如果压得太猛，它可能会试图破坏美国政府债券市场的稳定，而后者对全球金融体系的健康至关重要。	And let us not forget that China holds a massive volume of US Treasury bonds which, if pushed too hard, it could use to try to destabilize the US government bond market, which is essential to the health of the global financial system.
在作某些声明和最近接受纽约时报托马斯·弗里德曼采访时，奥巴马将伊朗协议与1972年理查德·尼克松向中国开放相比。	In some of his statements, and in his recent interview with Thomas Friedman of the New York Times, Obama compared the deal with Iran to Richard Nixon’s opening to China in 1972.
比如在Kargopol博物馆矗立着一座投掷者的泥塑雕像，是偷窃犯人包裹的看守后代向博物馆捐赠的，雕像的里面灌满了蜂蜜。	In the Kargopol museum, for example, stands a clay pitcher, presented to the museum by the descendants of a guard who appropriated a prisoner's parcel - a pitcher full of honey.
不管经济学家获得如此独特地位的原因何在，诺贝尔奖光环可以也确实常常让有害于公共利益 — — 比如推动不平等和增加造成金融危机的可能性 — — 的政策获得信誉。	Whatever the reason for economists’ unique status, the halo conferred by the prize can – and often has – lend credibility to policies that harm the public interest, for example by driving inequality and making financial crises more likely.
但气候变化对非洲的打击却最大，因为它严重影响到非洲大陆脆弱的农业部门，而农业部门养活了70%的非洲人口。	Yet climate change will hit Africa hardest, because it will cripple the continent’s vulnerable agricultural sector, on which 70% of the population depends.
因此，尽管对于让伊朗永久放弃核野心方面，美国显然比以色列有更好的条件发动战争，但美国极有可能认为这一目标实在成本太高。	As a result, the US, though certainly better equipped than Israel for a war to ensure that Iran forever abandons its nuclear ambitions, could nonetheless conclude that that objective is simply too costly.
尽管墨西哥出口比拉丁美洲其他所有国家的总和还要多，但其出口部门的效率提高被系统性地引导资源进入使用无薪工人的低生产率企业的政策抵消掉了。	Although Mexico exports more than all other Latin American countries combined, its export sectors’ efficiency gains have been offset by policies that systematically funnel resources toward low-productivity firms with non-salaried workers.
美联储经济学家团队的一份最新研究认为当前劳动力市场参与率下降几乎完全是因为人口老化和其他结构性原因所致。	A recent study by a team of Fed economists concluded that nearly all of the current decline in the labor-force participation rate reflects the aging of the population and other structural causes.
奇普拉斯也许有些“冲动 ” ， 其中左翼泛希腊社会运动党（Pasok）和中右翼新民主党的竞争对手会如是说，但绝不是非理性的。	Tsipras might be “impetuous,” as his mainstream adversaries from the center-left Pasok and the center-right New Democracy would say, but he is not irrational.
此外，世界 — — 不仅是西方世界，也包括俄罗斯和中国 — — 也将面临全球性的毒品、军火和恐怖行动扩散的危险。	Moreover, the world – not just the West, but Russia and China as well – would risk global proliferation of drugs, weapons, and terror.
中国的市场准入和知识产权保护记录劣迹斑斑，因此美国应该考虑中国制造2025战略会如何影响美国的利益。	Given China’s spotty record on market access and IP protection, the US is right to consider how the Made in China 2025 strategy will affect American interests.
事实上，欧洲工程的起点乃是，合适的���度、产权和竞争加上增长友好型税收制度和稳健的财政政策构成了经济成功的基础。	Indeed, the European project should start from the premise that appropriate institutions, property rights, and competition, together with a growth-friendly tax system and solid fiscal policies, are the basis of economic success.
就性别挑选而论，不难看出，不同的夫妇分别为自己的子女做出最佳的选择，结果却可能使所有孩子的处境还不如无法挑选子女性别的时候。	In the case of sex selection, it is easy to see that couples who independently choose the best for their own child can produce an outcome that makes all their children worse off than they would have been if no one could select the sex of their child.
Sadr反对封建主义是因为一个什叶派的地方政府会听命于他的敌人，西斯坦尼和SCIRI，并因此（按他的说法）被置于伊朗的影响之下。 为了强调他的讯息，Sadr让他的民兵去攻击Badr民兵。	Sadr opposes federalism because a Shia regional government would obey his enemies, Sistani and the SCIRI, and, he says, fall under Iranian influence.
即使是特朗普政府，也不得不在最终认识到美国的许多来自墨西哥的进口品中包含着大量美国要素时，重新考虑其废除北美自由贸易协定的计划。	Even the Trump administration had to reconsider its plan to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement when it finally realized that a lot of US imports from Mexico have substantial US content.
换句话说，在与东盟打交道时，中国有谈判两次的权利 — — 首先在东盟共同立场形成过程中通过其在东盟的最紧密盟友进行，然后再与所有东盟国谈判。	What this shows is that, in dealing with ASEAN, China gets to negotiate twice – first, through its closest allies within ASEAN in the formulation of common ASEAN positions, and then directly with an ASEAN team that could include one of its allies.
在当时的前现代世界，私人生活令人难以置信地公开化，而十九二十世纪的社会运动极大地拓展了个人隐私和自我定义的领域。	In that pre-modern world, private life was extraordinarily public, whereas the social movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries dramatically expanded the realm of individual privacy and self-definition.
对许多观察家而言，此次投票令人联想起6月的英国退欧公投和美国当选总统唐纳德·特朗普本月早些时候的胜利。	For many observers, the vote invoked the specter of June’s Brexit referendum and US President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier this month.
当我在阅读《海中的恶行：野生捕捞鱼类的福利》这份由fishcount.org.hk网站发布的开创性报告之时，这些童年往事又浮现在了眼前。	These childhood memories flooded back when I read Worse things happen at sea: the welfare of wild-caught fish, a breakthrough report released last month on fishcount.org.uk.
尽管俄罗斯尚未表示愿意放弃对乌俄边境的控制，对美谈判也没有取得什么进展，但普京显然知道现状是不可持续的。	And while Russia has not yet expressed a willingness to cede control of the Ukraine-Russia border, nor made progress in talks with the US, Putin surely knows that the status quo is unsustainable.
美国的人均国民收入在2006年（就在大衰退来临前）达到了一个顶峰，而2009年时的数据仍然比这一峰值要低5 ％ 。	US per capita national income peaked in 2006, just before the Great Recession, and was still 5% below that point in 2009.
因此我们竭尽全力鼓励多位经济学家（包括斯蒂格利茨）对合适的规模做出更大的估计，我为奥巴马所准备的简报备忘录反映了这一点。	So we worked to encourage a variety of economists, including Stiglitz, to offer larger estimates of what was appropriate, as reflected in the briefing memo I prepared for Obama.
然而，尽管权威人士大谈资产负债表如何如何健康，但企业债务水平（相对应于资产和净值来说）也处于历史最高点附近。	And yet, despite what pundits claim about strong balance sheets, firms’ debt levels, relative to assets and net worth, also remain near record-high levels.
实际上国际足联禁止直接和间接对该赛事的所有收入进行征税，涵盖所有大陆足球联盟，东道国广播公司，国际足联成员协会，服务提供商和承包商。	In fact, FIFA prohibits both direct and indirect taxation on all income from the event, exempting continental soccer confederations, host-country broadcasters, and FIFA member associations, service providers, and contractors.
封建主义没过多长时间就开始瓦解；自由和民主价值观逐渐兴起；妇女获得了更多权利；同时出现了提高生产效率、实现高增长和改善生活水平的经济体系。	It was not long before feudalism began to dissolve; liberal and democratic values gained traction; women secured greater rights; and economic systems emerged that could boost productivity, achieve high growth rates, and improve living standards.
作为德国政府主持撰写的报告《一条欧洲新增长路径》的合著者，笔者很抱歉在本已众说纷纭而又互为补充的绿色增长前景预测方面又增添了一把声音。	As a co-author of A New Growth Path for Europe, a report commissioned by the German government, I am guilty of contributing to this cacophony of complementary perspectives on green growth.
虽然这一数字较2012~14年期间的61.2％低点有所反弹，但比1980年后的平均64.6％的水平低两个百分点。	While that represents a bit of a rebound from the 61.2% low recorded in the 2012-2014 period, it is two percentage points below the post-1980 average of 64.6%.
（此外，在法国，由马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）领导的极右翼政党国民阵线（National Front）也在今年12月的第一轮选举中尽显强势，尽管最后没有赢得胜利。 ）	(In France, moreover, the far-right National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, showed its strength in the first round of December’s regional elections, though it eventually failed to win any).
1980~90年代时这三个国家都开始实施开放政策并经历了艰难的结构转型，提高了生产力，也为民众和消费者带来了广泛的益处。	In the 1980s and 1990s, these three countries began to open up, and experienced difficult structural transitions that nonetheless boosted productivity and provided broad-based benefits to citizens and consumers.
慕尼黑 — 《 经济学人 》 （ The Economist）最近报道说，德国的经常项目盈余太高了。 这是对的。	MUNICH – The Economist was right when it recently reported that Germany’s current-account surplus is too high.
但他们也密切跟进美国的政治，而在这些天来，许多人认为，领导层飘忽不定的风险已不再是金氏王朝所独有的现象。	But they also follow American politics closely, and these days, many regard the dangers of erratic leadership as no longer being confined to Kim’s regime.
这一死胡同战略将以与德国的徒劳博弈和绝望的经济实验为特征，比如以实质强制性的国民储蓄为政府债务融资。	This dead-end strategy will feature vain attempts to game Germany and desperate economic expedients, such as the essentially coercive capture of domestic savings to finance government debt.
而所有这些“改进”都伴随着其他几十个变化，造成了一场管理制度上的大混乱，既导致带宽紧张，又考验了执行的决心。	And all of these “improvements” followed dozens of other changes, creating a maelstrom of bureaucracy that strained bandwidth and tested resolve.
此外，也许最糟糕的是，恐怖分子和极端分子将学校作为目标，炸毁学校建筑，威胁学校教师，在巴基斯坦北部尤其猖獗。	And, perhaps worst of all, terrorists and extremists have been targeting schools, blowing up their buildings and threatening their teachers, particularly in the northern part of the country.
东非、南非、泰国和美国的393例临床试验产生了令人鼓舞的免疫原性反应和“有利的安全性和耐受性”指标。	Clinical trials involving 393 people in East Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States have yielded encouraging immunogenic responses and a “favorable safety and tolerability” profile.
尽管每个风暴都是一个巨大的威胁，但借助最近的周期性东风，欧洲有望各个击破三大危机，不会引起比暂时性扰动更严重的后果。	Though each poses a considerable threat, Europe, aided by the recent cyclical pickup, is in a position to address them individually, without risking more than a temporary set of disruptions.
丹麦向联合国大陆架边界委员会（United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf）递交了它的主张，加入了现时代的“大博弈 ” ： 争夺北极圈大部的经济控制权。	By filing its claim with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, Denmark has joined our era’s “great game”: the contest for economic control over a large part of the Arctic.
上个月，马来西亚最高法院驳回了反对派领袖安瓦尔·易卜拉欣（Anwar Ibrahim）对其五年有期徒刑、剥夺五年政治权利的判决的上诉 — — 这一决定令人震惊，毫无道理可言。	In Malaysia, the country's highest court last month rejected opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's appeal against a five-year prison sentence and a ban against running for public office for a further five years – a shocking and indefensible decision.
它们的利润被私人化，而任何超出它们的股本的损失被推给了债权人或者 — — 更妙的是 — — 推给了纳税人。	Their profits are privatized, but any losses exceeding their equity are dumped on their creditors, or, even better for them, on the taxpayers.
当然，格鲁吉亚总统米哈伊尔·萨卡什维利(Mikhail Saakashvili)有时可能确实显得轻率自私、傲慢自大，但如果俄国惩罚他的政策最终导致格鲁吉亚局势失控，那么俄国必须为此付出代价。	Of course, Georgia’s President Mikhail Saakashvili may at times be thoughtless and arrogant. But if Russia’s policy toward him lets events in Georgia get out of control, Russia will be held accountable.
通过创新，增强卫生体系的动态合作，以及政治意愿，世界能够保持从打击传染病中所获得的收益，并有效地打击NCD。	Through innovation, dynamic partnerships to strengthen health systems, and political will, the world can sustain the gains made against infectious disease, while also effectively combating NCDs.
正如诺贝尔经济学奖得主肯尼斯·阿罗在1972年指出的那样 ， “ 互信的缺失可以解释世界上绝大多数的经济落后 。 ”	As the Nobel laureate economist Kenneth Arrow argued in 1972, “much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.”
显然，在调整教法时，教师会混淆相关性和因果关系；但这些误差很快就会被发现，因为错误的假设不会带来更好的结果。	Clearly, teachers will be confusing correlation with causation when adjusting their strategies; but these errors will be revealed soon enough as their wrong assumptions do not yield better results.
萨缪尔逊是诺贝尔奖获得者、美国经济学家的翘楚：他的著名教科书《经济学 》 （ Economics）在他生前出版了14版，将全世界无数晚辈经济学家引入经济学殿堂。	Samuelson, a Nobel laureate, was the doyen of American economists: his famous textbook, Economics went through 14 editions in its author’s lifetime, introducing future economists worldwide to the rudiments of their craft.
另一方面，国家领导人视难民为临时性居民，可以通过主要为了满足发达经济体的具体劳动力市场需要而制定的单边或双边协定，用权宜之计来管理。	On the other hand, country leaders saw migration as something temporary that could be managed ad hoc, through unilateral or bilateral agreements primarily designed to fill specific labor-market needs in developed economies.
利用这个方法我们就有机会阐明：许多西方经济体乃至全球经济的未来，都将由它们拿捏金融、经济，社会和政治这四个互联驱动因素的能力来塑造。	Using this approach, it is possible to argue that the future of many Western economies, and that of the global economy, will be shaped by their ability to navigate four inter-related financial, economic, social, and political dynamics.
总的来说，所有承担企业社会责任的行为都应该由企业自己来决定，正如个人社会责任让每个个人依靠自己的良知和感觉来进行判断，决定哪些事情是值得支持和赞助的一样。	All these rationales for CSR suggest that it should be left to each corporation to determine, just as PSR leaves altruism to each individual’s conscience and sense of what needs supporting.
开罗，已故的伟大历史学家托尼·朱特（Tony Judt）在其身前最后的文章之一提出了我们应该从过去的一个世纪中学到什么的问题。 在过去的一个世纪中，如此之多的士兵和平民在冲突中丧生。	CAIRO – In one of his last essays, the late, great historian Tony Judt asked what we should have learned from the last century, a period in which so many soldiers and civilians died in conflict.
虽然独立的央行在帮助该地区在过去20年里实现宏观经济稳定中发挥了至关重要的作用，但和选举机构一样，它们也正受到日益强大的压力。	Although independent central banks have been crucial in helping the region achieve macroeconomic stability over the past two decades, they, like electoral authorities, are being subjected to increasing pressure.
这表明学前教育能够定性地提高儿童的社交技能或情商开发，使他们在随后的生活中拥有抓住更好经济机会方面的优势。	This suggests that preschool provides a qualitative boost to children’s social skills or emotional development that enables them to take better advantage of economic opportunity later in life.
与此同时，由于支持屠夫巴沙尔，俄罗斯在中东 — — 包括具有战略重要性的土耳其 — — 也越来越不受欢迎。	In the meantime, Russia is increasingly loathed across the Middle East, including in strategically important Turkey, for backing the murderous Assad.
许多人相信，经济之所以恢复，完全是因为政府为了二战所做的开支，许多人担心，随着战争的结束，经济会回归萧条。	Many believed that the economy recovered only because of government spending on World War II, and many feared that with the end of the war, the economy would return to its doldrums.
经济学家可能警告说，在美国经济已经接近充分就业的情况下，特朗普的保护主义、大幅减税以及不受控制的政府借贷将助长通胀压力。	Economists may warn that the combination of Trump’s protectionism, big tax cuts, and uncontrolled government borrowing, coming at a time when the US economy is already near full employment, will ultimately fuel inflationary pressure.
但在缺乏一场重大意外冲击的情况下，石油企业将继续被迫低价卖油油，因为它们得努力偿还高油价时进行投资所欠下的债务。	But, in the absence of a major unexpected shock, oil companies will remain under pressure to continue selling oil, even at low prices, as they struggle to service the large debts they incurred on investments when oil prices were high.
大萧条残酷地显示当房地产估值飙升、家庭债务快速增长期过去，家庭部门在房价下跌的同时竭力去除杠杆，经济��能因此进入灾难性的阶段。	As the Great Recession grimly illustrated, when a period of soaring real-estate valuations and rising household debt is followed by a period of falling prices, and households attempt to deleverage, the results can be catastrophic.
对此中国如何进行贸易操作肯定存在一些合理的担忧，包括前世贸组织总干事帕斯卡·拉米（Pascal Lamy）所谓的“对高科技产品进行的不透明，贸易扭曲性的补贴 ” 。	There are definitely valid concerns about how China conducts trade, including what Pascal Lamy, a former WTO director-general, calls “opaque, trade-distorting subsidization of high-tech products.”
我们已经明确了各政府机构制定政策的指导方针，建立了各机构间的协调构架，确定了服务和提供服务的全新渠道。	We have defined guidelines for shaping policy across government, and we have started to create structures for coordinating among government entities and for defining new approaches to services and service delivery.
他长期构思的欧洲演讲虽然不乏大家一致认可的观点，但也为长期激烈的争论埋下了伏笔 — — 而且此次争论的范围并不仅限于英国。	His long-gestating speech on Europe, although containing elements that many might share, also sows the seeds for a prolonged and acrimonious debate – and not just in Britain.
类似地，特朗普签署鼓励美国和台湾之间的正式访问的《台湾旅行法》后，中国进行了针对台湾的军事演习，并贿赂多米尼加共和国与台湾政府断绝外交关系。	Likewise, after Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages official visits between the US and the island, China staged war games against Taiwan and bribed the Dominican Republic to break diplomatic ties with the Taiwanese government.
过于严格的条件标准可能阻止最需要这种援助的成员国申请援助，但是过于宽松的标准又可能使潜在的援助使用者蒙上污名。	Overly strict qualification criteria are likely to deter members that may need this kind of support most from applying for it; but overly loose criteria may stigmatize potential users.
只要欧元区系统性风险得不到解决，主权违约可能性就不到消除，这将导致银行援助计划不断膨胀，造成不可接受的代价。	So long as the eurozone’s systemic risk is not addressed, sovereign defaults are not unlikely, leading to extended bank bailouts that could carry unacceptable costs.
走投无路的美国总统特朗普可能会转而使用世界各地独裁者都最喜欢的策略：制造外交政策危机以分散公众对本土问题的注意力。	A cornered President Donald Trump is likely to turn to a favorite tactic of autocrats everywhere: manufacturing foreign-policy crises to distract the public’s attention from problems at home.
伊拉克难民是一场不容忽视的危机：国际社会必须为该地区的国家减轻负担，同时为更多的最无助的伊拉克人提供重新安置的机会。	The Iraqi refugees are a crisis that cannot be ignored: the international community must alleviate the burden on the countries in the region, while offering resettlement opportunities to many more of the most vulnerable Iraqis.
虽然奥巴马已经接见了墨西哥总统费利佩·卡尔德龙 (Felipe Calderón ) ， 但是，白宫直到最近才宣布奥巴马的首次国外访问会是出访墨西哥，这是具有象征意义的。	It is emblematic that while Obama has received Mexican President Felipe Calderón, the White House only recently announced that one of his first foreign trips would be to Mexico.
年轻人们将参加卢旺达人的婚礼和葬礼，品尝卢旺达食物，学习一些当地语言 ，这些都是了解卢旺达人价值观的钥匙。	The young men and women will attend Rwandans’ weddings and funerals, learn to prepare and enjoy their foods, and acquire some of their language, the portal through which to view their sturdy values.
欧洲的紧缩派 — — 诺贝尔经济学奖得主保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）这样称呼他们 — — 输掉了这场争论。	Europe’s austerians, as the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman likes to call them, lost the argument.
作为STRIDE的一部分，旁遮普和开博尔-普什图省的180所学校加入了第二批学校，节约了大约1,200万美元建设成本。	As part of STRIDE, 180 schools in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have added a second shift, saving around $12 million in construction costs.
接着是这样的 ： “ 他来到工友们中间，说 ： ‘ 死于机器 ’ / 它们践踏了我们的未来，碾碎了我们的梦想 。 ”	And then: “He turned to his workmates and said: ‘Death to Machines’/They tread on our future and stamp on our dreams.”
施密特从1969年到1972年任德国国防部长、1972年到1974年任财政部长，1974年到1982年任联邦总理一职。	Schmidt was the country’s defense minister from 1969 to 1972, finance minister from 1972 to 1974, and federal chancellor from 1974 to 1982.
在“伊克斯托克”泄漏事件中，墨西哥石油公司采用上述方法（目的是尽可能压低损失数据）估算泄漏总量不足50万吨。	In the Ixtoc case, using such methods, Pemex (wanting to keep the loss figure low) estimated the spill to amount to a little under a half-million tons.
如今，在美国危机发生的20个月之后，从 2008年夏天开始，全球经济形势变得不可收拾，V型的观点不攻自破。 这也是美国乃至全球60年以来最糟糕的一次经济危机。	Today’s consensus among economists is that the recession is already over, that the US and global economy will rapidly return to growth, and that there is no risk of a relapse.
公民建军权已经过时，因此如今搬出第二修正案的持枪者捍卫的只是个人枪支拥有权，看起来好像这样能够提供抵御暴政的保护。	Since citizens’ militias are anachronistic, gun owners now use the second amendment merely to defend individual gun ownership, as if that somehow offers protection against tyranny.
巴黎 — — 今年6月，巴林、埃及、利比亚、马尔代夫、沙特阿拉伯、阿拉伯联合酋长国和也门等国切断了与卡塔尔的外交和经济联系。	PARIS – This June, Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, the Maldives, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen cut diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar.
慈善组织对于这些问题没有准备这一事实告诉他们二人，其他捐助者和基金会或多或少都是在没有做出支持谁的明智决定所需要的信息的情况下盲目捐款。	The fact that charities were unprepared for such questions indicated to Karnofsky and Hassenfeld that other donors and foundations give more or less blindly, without the information needed to make sound decisions about whom to support.
过去30年来，美国的收入不平等增长非常显著；实际上，美国目前的收入不平等程度在经合组织国家中仅次于智利、墨西哥和土耳其排名第四。	During the past three decades, income inequality in the United States has increased significantly; indeed, the US now has the fourth-highest level of income inequality in the OECD, behind Chile, Mexico, and Turkey.
有人或许会认为这种增长是合理的，因为标准普尔500指数报告的每股实际季度收益基本上在同期（从2009年第一季度到2018年第二季度）也上涨了3.8倍。	One might think the increase is justified, given that real quarterly S&P 500 reported earnings per share rose 3.8-fold over essentially the same period, from the first quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2018.
中国的能源改革成功与否事关重大，尤其是该国打造世界最大可再生能源发电系统的努力 — — 中国的雄心超出所有人的想象，西方做出的努力根本无法与之相比。	Much depends on the success of China’s energy reforms, and in particular on its efforts to build the world’s largest renewable power system – an ambition far larger than anything imagined, much less attempted, in the West.
诺贝尔奖得主埃里诺·奥斯特罗姆（Elinor Ostrom）的研究成果表明我们可以用给予而非索取的反向策略来解决社会困局。	Following insights by the Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom, we know that social dilemmas can be solved using the inverse strategy: giving instead of demanding.
特朗普誓言要将制造业职位“带回”美国，但如果让美国企业可以更顺利地在中国进行制造和创新，又怎么实现这一承诺呢？	Trump vows to “bring back” manufacturing jobs to the US. How does making it easier for American companies to manufacture and innovate in China contribute to fulfilling that promise?
悲剧在于，从人道角度看，这些幻想的代价实在高昂 — — 2014年4月以来，拒不停火已经在东乌克兰造成了超过6,000人死亡 — — 从地缘政治角度看，代价也十分昂贵。	The tragedy is that the price of these illusions has been extraordinarily high in human terms – the ceasefire-defying death toll in eastern Ukraine has risen to more than 6,000 since April 2014 – and dangerously high in geostrategic terms as well.
也许反弹最强烈的的要数法兰西银行行长克里斯蒂安·诺耶尔（Christian Noyer ） ， 他称这份改革方案“不负责任，与欧洲经济的利益南辕北辙 。 ”	Perhaps the strongest reaction came from Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer, who called the proposals “irresponsible and contrary to the interests of the European economy.”
相反，如果继续放任政治失灵让世界经济走向错误的路径，就会导致一系列狭隘的费协作经济衰退对策、更大的不平等性和严重的金融动荡。	The alternate path, onto which continued political dysfunction would push the world, leads through a thicket of parochial and uncoordinated policies to economic recession, greater inequality, and severe financial instability.
持续经济增长以包容性制度为先决条件，因为创新 — — 以及创造性破坏及其所蕴含的不稳定性 — — 取决于包容性制度。	Sustained economic growth presupposes inclusive institutions, because innovation – and the creative destruction and instability that it wreaks – depends on them.
简而言之，汹涌流向美国的资本人为地压低了利率并抬高了资产价格，导致银行和监管标准松懈并且最终造成瓦解。	Simply put, surging capital flows into the US artificially held down interest rates and inflated asset prices, leading to laxity in banking and regulatory standards and, ultimately, to a meltdown.
当经济陷入流动性陷阱时 — — 即需求萎靡，物价停滞或下跌，利率接近于零时 — — 常规宏观经济逻辑不再有效。	When the economy is in a liquidity trap – when demand is deficient, prices are stagnant or falling, and interest rates approach zero – normal macroeconomic logic goes out the window.
奥斯卡·琼森是伦敦国王学院的博士生，专门研究俄罗斯的非军事战争，他告诉我抵御俄罗斯干预如此困难的原因是其手段非常微妙、复杂而且往往具有较高的可信度。	Oscar Jonsson, a doctoral student at King’s College London who specializes in Russian non-military warfare, told me that what makes countering Russian interference so difficult is that the tactics are subtle, sophisticated, and often believable.
去年8月，以色列允许在C区额外派驻7个营和20辆坦克。 可是埃及武装部队一直没有全额派驻部队，甚至懒得将坦克运过苏伊士运河。	Last August, the Israelis permitted an additional seven battalions and 20 tanks in Zone C. But the Egyptian armed forces never brought in the full number of additional troops, and did not even bother to transport the tanks across the Suez Canal.
因此，也为了从欧洲人目前的困难局面中走出并变得更加强大，欧洲领导人必须自信地认定更加一体化、更加无所不能的欧盟是不可阻挡的未来趋势。	For this reason, and in order to emerge stronger from the difficult situation in which Europeans now find themselves, Europe’s leaders must work with the conviction that the future is inexorably linked to a more integrated and more capable Union.
在智利，如今53%的学生在受教育券资助的学校上学（其中许多直到最近才开始转为非盈利性学校 ） ， 尽管常常还需要缴纳额外的学费。	In Chile today, 53% of all children attend voucher-financed private schools (many of them until recently run for profit), despite the top-up fees they often charge.
如果选民拒绝“无协议脱欧”而支持拒绝脱欧，将会有效压制梅的强硬派对手，而她的首相地位也将在2022年大选前得到保护。	If voters rejected “no deal” in favor of no Brexit, May’s hardline opponents would be silenced, and her position as Prime Minister would be secured until the 2022 election.
毕竟，苹果、谷歌和Facebook加起来的价值便已超过1万亿美元，虽然这些公司的初始投资额与之相比根本不值一提。	After all, Apple, Google, and Facebook are jointly worth more than $1 trillion, even though the capital originally invested in them is a minuscule fraction of that.
于是乎，太多的政策制定者和评论家都急于下结论，坚持伊朗就是一意孤行要搞核武器，或者追求一种极为危险的破坏能力。	That said, too many policymakers and commentators have rushed to judgment, insisting that Iran is irrevocably determined to build nuclear weapons, or that it wants a break-out capability that is just as dangerous.
随着10个新的国家在2004年以及另外两个国家在2007年初加入欧盟，联盟的成员国现在已经扩展到了中欧和东欧。	With the accession of 10 new states in 2004 and another two at the beginning of 2007, the Union’s membership now spans central and eastern Europe.
该体系会把集团公司作为一个整体来计算所得收入，然后按照一个反映各业务单元对集团公司总收入的贡献的公式将收入“分配”到各成员国。	Earned income would be calculated on a consolidated basis for the group and then “apportioned” among the member states according to a formula reflecting each business unit’s contribution to overall group income.
我们也可以确定，增加农业产出是否会导致自然资源更加难以管理；或者，扩大可再生能源资源是否会导致干旱地区的水供给耗竭。	And we could determine if increasing agricultural production would make it harder to manage natural resources; or if expanding renewable-energy sources would deplete the water supply in already-arid regions.
它确实诞生于财政紧迫感，但其最大的风险是它最终煽动围绕这一上限本身的政治冲突，而不能促进关于必须做出的艰难的财政选择的深思熟虑。	While born of a real sense of fiscal urgency, the biggest risk is that it will eventually fuel political conflict around the ceiling itself, rather than foster deliberation about the difficult fiscal choices that must be made.
不同于传统智慧，服务业的日益增长是为了满足国内消费需求，并不意味着制造业和资本投资的末日，更不意味着经济增长走到尽头。	Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the growth of services in China to meet domestic demand does not mean the end of manufacturing and capital investment, much less of economic growth.
事实上，战后是自由贸易历史持续时间最长的时期 — — 这是个特别了不起的壮举，因为世界遭遇了大萧条以来最严重的经济衰退。	In fact, the post-war era has been the longest sustained period of trade liberalization in history – a particularly impressive feat, given that the world has just suffered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
日本的人口下降和劳动力队伍萎缩是一个重大长期性挑战 — — 这在安倍要求更多妇女外出工作的呼吁中可见一斑。	Japan’s declining population and shrinking labor force is a major long-term challenge – reflected in Abe’s call for more women to work outside the home.
比如，2013年，三分之一以上的受访中国企业表示难以招聘到熟练工，61%将其归咎于一般就业技能的短缺。	For example, in 2013, more than one-third of the Chinese firms surveyed said that they struggled to recruit skilled workers, with 61% attributing this to a shortage of general employable skills.
今年1月的达沃斯世界经济论坛上，中国新任中央财经领导小组办公室主任刘鹤暗示即将到来的改革将以惊人的速度推进。	At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Liu He, China’s new vice premier for economic policy, hinted that upcoming reforms would be carried out with surprising speed.
因此，指定伦敦和法兰克福人民币清算行的决定实际上只不过是中国促进建立由多种而非一种全球货币组成的国际货币体系的又一步骤。	Thus, the decision to designate renminbi clearing banks in London and Frankfurt is, in effect, one more step by China to foster the emergence of an international monetary system with several global currencies, not just one.
总体上，那里至少有60个这样的对于欧洲部队来说是被“告诫”的行动限制区，不允许指挥官将军队派驻到这些最需要的地方。	Overall, there are at least 60 such operating restrictions – known as “caveats” – on European troops, preventing commanders from deploying military assets where they are most needed.
这一自负的确定并不新鲜 — — 毕竟，美国就是在传教士般的热情下建立起来的 — — 但它们的道德自大是新鲜事。	This overweening certitude is not new – the United States, after all, was founded on missionary zeal – but the ethical arrogance is.
如今，该行业需要跨入二十一世纪，以便满足新建筑的日益增长的需求、填补全世界日益扩大的住房和基础设施缺口。	Now, the industry needs to enter the twenty-first century, so that it can meet increasing demand for new structures and address the world’s growing housing and infrastructure gaps.
但专家的担忧是值得关注的，也是健康的，因为市场永远有效这样的信念只能在有人不完全相信它并且认为可以通过市场择时获利时才正确。	But the experts’ concern is notable and healthy, because the belief that markets are always efficient can survive only when some people do not completely believe it and think that they can profit by timing the markets.
事实上，他们是电网的守护者，负责清理周边植被和修复因野生动物和其他因素造成的损坏情况 — — 并在此过程中学习新技能。	In effect, they are the guardians of the fences, keeping them clear of vegetation and repairing damage caused by wildlife and other factors – and learning new skills in the process.
只要成员国仍拥有完全的主权，投资者就得不到保证。 若欧元区分崩离析，一些国家将拒绝偿付 — — 或拒绝替其他国家偿付。	As long as member states remain fully sovereign, investors cannot be assured that if the eurozone breaks up, some states will not simply refuse to pay – or will not refuse to pay for the others.
关于英国是否保留欧盟资格的全民公决将在2017年年底前进行。 现在的讨论是变革谈判的第一步，欧盟领导人希望通过谈判说服英国选民选择欧洲。	With a referendum on the UK’s continued EU membership set to take place before the end of 2017, the talks are the first step toward negotiating changes which, EU leaders hope, will convince British voters to choose Europe.
毕竟，在公众面前走秀，进行整容，自我陶醉其中 — — 他的朋友西尔维奥•贝卢斯科尼在意大利这样做受到了很好的效果（后来也不是这样了 ） — —不会让俄罗斯人害怕，甚至得不到俄罗斯人的尊重，在俄罗斯，强硬的统治者常常是宠儿。	After all, narcissistic publicity stunts and facelifts – which worked well for his friend Silvio Berlusconi in Italy (until they didn’t) – don’t inspire fear, or even respect, among Russians, where an iron-fisted ruler is always the preferred choice.
但与金大中和卢拉一样，齐普拉斯可以从一些认为“如果他现在说这些措施不可避免，那么确实是别无选择了”的左派中赢得政治支持。	But like Kim and Lula, Tsipras could marshal political support from some on the left who reckon, “If he now says that these measures are unavoidable, there truly must be no alternative.”
其他国家还建立了绿色银行，而90％的私人气候融资投资都被投入到资本所在国的事实则反映了这类银行对本国事务的重点关注。	Other countries have established green banks, whose domestic focus reflects the fact that 90% of private climate-finance investments are made within the capital’s country of origin.
但是，如果金融体系的堤坝倒塌了，我们可能会经受十年严重的通货紧缩，并使扩张性的经济刺激措施起不到任何作用。	But if the financial system’s dykes collapse, we may be headed for a decade of severe deflation, rendering expansionary stimulus useless.
因此，也许裕仁一直在寻求表达自己的观点：日本应该避免与美国开战，特别是已经与中国进行了四年多残酷又不成功的征服战的情况下。	Thus, Hirohito might have been seeking to express his view that Japan should avoid a war with the US, especially given that the country had been fighting a savage and unsuccessful war of conquest in China for more than four years.
此外，日本和中国一样，深受儒家文化影响。 19世纪、20世纪中国很多改革者都怪罪儒家文化，认为是这种文化严重阻碍了他们自己国家的发展和现代化进程。	Moreover, like China, Japan was a society steeped in Confucian culture, which many Chinese reformers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries blamed as a critical impediment to their own country’s development and modernization.
始于2001年的所谓的反恐战争最终演变成动摇整个中东、危害人民的自由、破坏人民的安全、改变他们的社会的性质的残酷的冲突。	The so-called War on Terror that began in 2001 has evolved into multiple brutal conflicts that are destabilizing the entire Middle East, eroding people’s freedoms, undermining their safety, and transforming the very nature of their societies.
俄石油就是最好的例子，2013年它借贷大约400亿美元b用于收购竞争对手秋明-英石油（TNK-BP ） 。	The best example is Rosneft, which borrowed about $40 billion in 2013 to buy its competitor, TNK-BP.
毕竟，我们目前面临的实际问题就是经济瘫痪。 不确定性使得公司(更高的产量) 和消费者 (公司生产的产品) 都推迟了开支决定。	After all, the real problem that we are currently facing is one of paralysis: uncertainty has placed many spending decisions – by businesses (on higher output) and by consumers (on the items that businesses produce) – on hold.
在已经进行了15年 — — 并且还没有完成 — — 的过程中，35个高负债穷国的债务获得了豁免，其代价超过1,000亿美元。	In a process that has already taken 15 years – and remains unfinished – the debts of 35 highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs) have been forgiven, at a cost of more than $100 billion.
如果印度像如今的欧洲那样各自为政、权力分散，那么它可能从迈向这个方向的步骤中获利，尽管欧洲本身正挣扎着想要集中化。	As dysfunctional as a decentralized Europe seems to be these days, India might benefit from moving a few steps in that direction, even as Europe itself struggles to become more centralized.
比如，联合利华拒绝了资本市场的短期压力 — — 不再公布盈利季报，扩大其注意力以推进更大的社会利益，而不仅仅着眼于股东利益。	For example, Unilever has rejected the short-term pressures of capital markets by ending quarterly earnings reporting and broadening its focus to advance greater social interests, rather than just the interests of its shareholders.
这个前车之鉴触目惊心地说明了，政府及其财政会在一夜之间变得何其脆弱，而不适当的财政政策会成为稳定性货币政策多么大的绊脚石！	That precedent should serve as a warning of how vulnerable governments and their finances can rapidly become, and of how fiscal policy can stand in the way of a monetary approach oriented toward stability.
而当赫尔岑写下这些文字的时候，莫斯科不仅忙于镇压波兰人并确保能继续统治波兰近半个世纪，而且还努力和中国一起瓜分中亚（所谓土耳其斯坦地区 ） 。	When Herzen was writing his words, Moscow was not only busy successfully putting down the Poles, reasserting its rule there for another half-century, but also, together with China, carving up Central Asia, known then as Turkestan.
第一个选择就是通过最低工资法律或者支付社会安置收入来维护低技能者的收入，这就意味着要求私营部门支付最低工资。	The first option is to defend the wages of the low skilled through minimum-wage laws or paying social replacement incomes which imply minimum wage demands against the private economy.
最后，欧洲领导人还可以一读芭芭拉·塔克曼（Barbara Tuchman）的《八月之抢 》 （ The Guns of August，注意标题中的月份 ） 。	Finally, European leaders should consider adding to their book bag Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August (again, notice the month).
为应对这些进步所必须做出的决策 — — 那些与世界的本质或我们自己所创造的事物相关的进步 — — 需要尽可能准确的信息。	The decisions that must be taken in response to these developments – those related to the nature of the world or those we have created ourselves – require as much accurate information as possible.
1994年，乌克兰同意放弃从苏联继承的核武器，以此换取美国、英国和俄罗斯保护乌克兰领土完整和主权的庄严承诺。	In 1994, Ukraine agreed to give up the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the Soviet Union, in return for a solemn commitment by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia to protect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
但是在许多发展中国家，由于不受限制的跨界资本流动和金融市场放松管制，融资变得更加容易，但这些资金却未能流入各类长期性投资领域，特别是制造业。	But in many developing countries, easier access to finance – owing to unrestricted cross-border capital flows and financial-market deregulation – still has not led to more financing for long-term investments, particularly in manufacturing.
第二年，大卫·洛克菲勒（David Rockefeller）和兹比格纽·布热津斯基（Zbigniew Brzezinski）建立了三方委员会，每年一次开会讨论这一问题。	The following year, David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski created the Trilateral Commission, which meets once a year to discuss such problems.
从那以后，政府已经设立了一个违反宪法规定的全权制宪委员会，取消了三大主要反对党，解雇了民选市长和代表，并窃取了三次选举成果。	Since then, the government has installed an unconstitutional Constituent Assembly with full powers, deregistered the three main opposition parties, sacked elected mayors and deputies, and stolen three elections.
第二个理由可能是，即使通胀预期被锚定（因此价格稳定 ） ， 决策者也不知道如何在保持其锚定状态的同时提振经济的支出流。	The second reason might be that even with anchored inflation expectations (and thus price stability), policymakers do not know how to keep them anchored while boosting the flow of spending in the economy.
此外，美国应当鼓励朝鲜做出关键让步 — — 例如，甚至是在完全、可验证及不可逆转的无核化完成之前，允许国际核查人员对其整个核计划展开侵入性核查。	Moreover, the US should reward critical concessions by North Korea – for example, permission to conduct intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear program by international inspectors – even before the completion of CVID.
现任欧盟高级代表凯瑟琳·阿什顿（Catherine Ashton）继续证明着欧盟外交政策机构的价值，比如，她牵线促成了塞尔维亚和科索沃之间的重要和平协议，在对伊朗核谈判方面也起到了关键作用。	Current EU High Representative Catherine Ashton continues to prove the worth of EU foreign-policy institutions by, for example, brokering a remarkable peace between Serbia and Kosovo and playing a key role in nuclear negotiations with Iran.
由负责内部市场和服务的欧盟委员巴尼尔（Michel Barnier）提出的最新方案便是实施这一办法的努力。	The recent proposal by Michel Barnier, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services, is an effort to implement this solution.
儒教的原则在后儒教时代的东亚仍然为人们提供着内在的指引，正如《圣经》的训诫仍然是后宗教时代的西方不可或缺的标准一样。	Confucianism’s tenets still provide an inner compass to most East Asians in a post-Confucian age, just as Biblical admonitions remain standards for the West in a post-religious age.
正是在这样的背景下 — — 巨大的人口竞争极少数专业学院学位 — — 科塔补习班这样的机构得以兴盛。	It is in this context – with a huge population competing for a tiny number of seats in professional colleges – that coaching institutes like those in Kota thrive.
有一些经济学家，尤其是奥地利人哥特弗里德·哈勃勒（ Gottfried Haberler ）曾经构想了一套替代方案：由大金融机构和浮动汇率促成持续的资本流动，但是政治上的响应者寥寥。	The alternative of continued capital movements, facilitated by major financial institutions, and flexible exchange rates was set out by a few economists, notably the Austrian Gottfried Haberler, but found no political resonance.
叙利亚、阿富汗和索马里是难民的最大来源，但更多难民来自利比亚、厄立特里亚、中非共和国、南苏丹、尼日利亚和刚果民主共和国。	Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia are the largest sources of refugees, but many more come from Libya, Eritrea, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
卡梅伦用儿童凶杀案侦探桌游作比方说 ： “ 你不需要超级线索（Cluedo）就能知道，有人聚集在图书馆下水道旁边密谋 。 ”	Referring to a children’s murder-detective board game, Cameron declared: “You don’t need a Cluedo set to know that someone has been clubbed with the lead piping in the library.”
2010年6月，在其第一份预算中，财政大臣乔治·奥斯本（George Osborne）警告说 ， “ 希腊是一国不直面其问题的例子，我决心避免这一覆辙 。 ”	In his first budget in June 2010, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne warned that “you can see in Greece an example of a country that didn’t face up to its problems, and that’s a fate I am determined to avoid.”
事实上，在印度政府做出接受外国零售商的决定的同时，法国零售商家乐福宣布将在今年年底关闭其在新加坡的大量业务。	Indeed, the Indian government’s decision to welcome foreign retailers coincided with French retailer Carrefour’s announcement that it will shut down its substantial operations in Singapore by the end of this year.
全球的预防艾滋病计划将花费270亿美元，但是却有巨大的潜在社会利益：这项计划将在2010年之前避免2,800万多的新HIV/AIDS艾滋病病例。	A comprehensive program would cost $27 billion, but the potential social benefits would be immense: avoidance of more than 28 million new cases of HIV/AIDS by 2010.
就连享有盛誉的事实审核员也无法就“给苦难者以慰藉、给舒适者以折磨 ！ ” 这条知名记者箴言的起源达成一致。	Even reputable fact-checkers disagree on the origin of the famous admonition to journalists: “Comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable!”
为了限制劳动力成本的上升，工资被抑制，在过去20年中每年只增加5 % ， 尽管生产率增长年率高达8.5 % 。	In order to cap the rise in labor costs, wages were suppressed, growing by only 5% annually over the last 20 years, even as productivity grew at an annual rate of 8.5%.
自去年12月黄热病病毒在安哥拉首都兼最大城市罗安达现身以来，已经夺走293人的生命，疑似传染病例2,267人。	Since the virus emerged in Luanda, Angola’s capital and most populous city, last December, it has killed 293 people and infected a suspected 2,267.
目前的任务是在代表性社会中引入原型系统，以证明什么是可行的，发现消费者偏好，确定最具吸引力的商业模式，识别并避免意料外结果。	The task now is to introduce prototype systems in representative communities, in order to prove what is possible, discover consumers’ preferences, determine the most attractive business models, and identify and avert unexpected consequences.
2003年美国侵入伊拉克时，许多观察者，特别是阿拉伯世界观察者，认为推翻萨达姆·侯赛因的逊尼派少数群体政权将强化伊朗的地区地位。	When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, many observers, especially in the Arab world, believed that the removal of Saddam Hussein’s Sunni-minority regime would enhance Iran’s position in the region.
当局让国内的货币和财政政策都服从于维持固定汇率—即使是在贬值压力极大的1997-98年亚洲（金融）危机期间。	They subordinated domestic monetary and fiscal policies to maintaining the fixed exchange rate – even during the 1997-98 Asian crisis, despite great pressure to devalue.
坦白说，选举结果只能影响制宪大会200个议席中的80席。 制宪大会将任命总理、政府以及宪法起草委员会。	To be sure, the results will affect only 80 of the 200 seats in the constituent assembly, whose mandate is to appoint a prime minister, government, and a committee to draft the constitution.
与之相比，2004年3月11日发生在西班牙造成200人死亡的恐怖袭击引发了尝试通过与伊斯兰建立理解和和解来消除极端主义思想的“反十字军运动 ” 。	By contrast, the March 11, 2004, terrorist attack on Spain, which left 200 dead, triggered an “anti-crusade” that seeks to disarm extremism by building bridges of understanding and reconciliation with Islam.
但所有共和党候选人都以反对枪支管制措施为豪；事实上，对于允许人们深藏武器进入学校或酒吧，他们一点问题都没有。	And yet all of the Republican candidates are proud of opposing gun-control measures; indeed, they have no problem allowing people to enter a school or a bar bearing concealed weapons.
十位农民负责种竹子，而25位制造者则负责将这些竹子制造成可以在加纳颠簸的道路上骑行或者出口海外的环保型自行车。	Ten farmers grow the bamboo, and 25 builders craft it into environmentally friendly bikes that can be used on Ghana’s bumpy roads or exported overseas.
当喜爱刨根问底的记者对她的政治安排的细节提出质疑的时候，她最有效的防御手段（至少到目前为止）是 ： “ 如果我不是位女性，你根本就不敢提出这样的问题 ！ ”	When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda, her highly effective line of defense (so far!) has been: “You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman!”
拉丁美洲地区最大的国家巴西陷入了严重的政治危机；当今年夏天巴西举办奥运会之际，在任总统罗塞夫很可能需要出庭受审。	Brazil, the region’s largest country, is in the middle of a severe political crisis; the incumbent president, Dilma Rousseff, may well be on trial while the Olympics are being staged in her country later this summer.
类似地，如果欧元区无法通过强化其经济治理结构实现进一步融合，那么欧洲的金融危机还将继续，破坏社会流动性和社会正义。	Likewise, if the eurozone fails to integrate further by strengthening its economic-governance structures, Europe’s ongoing financial crisis will only continue, impeding social mobility and undermining social justice.
劳动者们离开爱尔兰或者希腊并不是因为那里的生产力低下，而是因为只有离开那里，他们才能摆脱掉父母遭受的债务负担。	Workers may leave Ireland or Greece not because their productivity there is lower, but because, by leaving, they can escape the debt burden incurred by their parents.
从历史上看，贸易体系既有极其开放的，也有受规则、关税和非关税壁垒严格限制的，其变迁受自由派或保护主义经济和政治力量的相对优势驱动。	Historically, trade systems have ranged from rather open to severely restricted by rules, tariffs, or non-tariff barriers, driven by shifts in the relative strength of liberalizing or protectionist economic and political forces.
不像布什政府那样被人抓住对科学轻描淡写，这一委员会直截了当地告诉我们说是人类要对地球最近的变暖负责。	Unlike the Bush administration, caught downplaying the science, the IPCC squarely tells us that mankind is largely responsible for the planet’s recent warming.
美国的一些不切实际的慈善家像内格罗蓬特，怀揣着价值100美元的笔记本电脑，指出了真正的问题所在：非洲在技术上远远落后，从而使飞速的跳跃式前进成为可能。	Americans do-gooders like Nicholas Negroponte, with his $100 laptop, have identified the right problem: Africa is way behind technologically and rapid leap-frogging is possible.
日本央行的新行长黑田东彦（Haruhiko Kuroda）已经向市场发出明确的信号，日本央行的目标是在多年的价格零增长之后，让年通胀率保持在2 % 。	Haruhiko Kuroda, the Bank of Japan’s new governor, has sent a clear signal to markets that the BOJ is targeting 2% annual inflation, after years of near-zero price growth.
这一朝向更大的地区一体化的趋势将形成一个独一无二的机会，如果能够建立一些“滩头阵地 ” ， 就有望赢得一整个极为诱人的市场。	This trend toward greater regional integration will offer a unique opportunity to tap an entire highly lucrative market from a few beachheads.
事实上，就连极右翼政党国民阵线（National Front ）领导人马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）一开始也警告反穆斯林的副作用，声称一小撮迷失的年轻人决不能代表大部分法国穆斯林。	Indeed, even Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, initially warned against the dangers of an anti-Muslim backlash, stating that a few lost young men were in no way representative of the majority of French Muslims.
事实上，联合国秘书长潘基文批评伊朗没有在国际原子能机构的新报告认为它寻求持有核武器时保证事实并非如此。	Indeed, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticized Iran for not assuring the world that it is not seeking nuclear arms at a time when the International Atomic Energy Agency has published a new report suggesting that it is.
大部分墨西哥工人仍然在“非正式”企业工作 — — 特别是那些员工得不到薪酬合同的企业 — — 这些企业的生产率只有融入了世界经济的大型现代企业的几分之一。	The bulk of Mexican workers remain employed in “informal” firms – especially firms in which employees are not on salaried contracts – where productivity is a fraction of the level in large, modern firms that are integrated into the world economy.
马里暂时恢复了稳定，但北部的分裂主义的图阿雷格叛军刚刚退出了和平谈判，因此许多专家认为马里冲突重燃和扩大只是时间问题。	Mali may be stable for now, but, with the separatist Tuareg rebels in country’s north having just suspended their participation in peace talks, many experts believe that it is only a matter of time before the conflict there reignites and spreads.
然而展望未来，塞浦路斯不但有能力恢复增长，甚至有可能弥合与岛屿北部土耳其支持的小国间由来已久的分裂。	Looking ahead, however, Cyprus has the means not only to recover, but even to heal its longstanding division with the Turkish-backed statelet in the north of the island.
如果美国对国内消费征税，则将从进口中获得更大收入，让政府能够降低因美国企业的国内和海外销售而产生的所得税。	If the US were to raise taxes on domestic consumption, it would collect more revenue from imports, which would allow the government to cut income taxes stemming from US firms’ domestic and foreign sales.
这一讨论很重要，因为全世界193个国家的政府将在9月齐聚联合国，最终确定2030年世界所要实现的发展目标。	This discussion matters, because the world’s 193 national governments will meet at the United Nations in September to finalize a list of development targets for the world to meet by 2030.
它还有可能改变经济，让欧洲中央银行在下一次欧元危机中无可作为：欧洲央行总是能够击退市场投机，但对来自选民的解体压力毫无反抗之力。	It will also transform economics, by paralyzing the European Central Bank in the next euro crisis: while the ECB can always defeat market speculation, it is powerless against breakup pressures from voters.
但其实英国之所以能在帝国衰落之后依然保持着国际影响力，就是依靠公民的力量以及政策制定者所受到的教育。	Having lost its empire, Britain retains outsized global influence simply because of the power of its civilization and the education absorbed by its decision-makers.
伴随着对恐怖主义的恐慌心理，和对资产股票价格不稳定性的怀疑心理，这些大城市的地理知名度也有回弹趋势。 纽约、巴黎、伦敦这些地方越出名，他们就变得越耀眼而有魅力。	As with fear of terrorism and suspicion of equities, geographical celebrity appears resilient, if not self-reinforcing: the more famous New York, Paris, and London get, the more glamorous they become.
美国 — — 以及全世界 — — 需要通过协商和熟虑制定公共政策，而不是让一个病态日深的人来制定公共政策。	The US – and the world – needs public policy by consultation and deliberation, not one man’s worsening pathology.
通过独特的个人经历，他能够沟通非洲、美洲，甚至亚洲—年幼时他曾在那里的一所穆斯林学校学习—从而重塑美国的世界形象和讯息。	By virtue of his unique personal history, he can bridge Africa, America, and even Asia – where he studied as a young boy in a Muslim school – thereby reviving the universal image and message of America.
但直到视治国如经营企业的特朗普上台后，美国终于有了一位愿意走这条路的领导人，即便这有损于长期以来一直作为美国外交政策基础的价值观。	But it was not until Trump, who views running a country much like running a business, that the US had a leader who was willing to pursue that path, even if it undermined the values that have long underpinned US foreign policy.
更广泛地说，保持军事扩张得到监督、扩大武器贸易条约（Arms Trade Treaty）参与国、改善国防当局间的互相谅解现已成为亚洲所面临的重大问题。	More broadly, keeping military expansion in check, enlarging the number of countries that conclude the Arms Trade Treaty, and improving mutual understanding among national defense authorities are now the paramount issues facing Asia.
巴沙尔-阿萨德总统政权拒绝允许世卫组织进入反叛分子控制地区接种疫苗，并直接导致了2013年小儿麻痹症的流行。	The refusal of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime to allow WHO to carry out vaccination programs in insurgent-controlled areas directly resulted in a polio outbreak in 2013.
批评者不仅对这些成绩视而不见，同时对在苏丹和缅甸问题上的僵局的突破也嗤之以鼻，说这是放弃人权的道德标准。	Critics charge that these accomplishments, as well as efforts to unblock the stalemates in Sudan and Burma, have been achieved at the price of giving up moral clarity on human rights.
美国平均每工人生产率大约为150,000美元，��果墨西哥制造业的收益全部都归因于NAFTA，就相当于333,000个美国工作岗位，还不到总就业岗位的400分之一。	With average US productivity per worker at about $150,000, if Mexico’s manufacturing gain is attributed entirely to NAFTA, this represents about 333,000 US jobs, or less than one out of every 400 jobs in the US.
欧盟还对俄罗斯天然气巨头Gazprom采取了反垄断调查，批评了3月份大选期间的镇压游行过程中所出现的侵犯人权行为。 普京通过这次大选重回总统宝座。	It also launched an antitrust probe against Russian gas giant Gazprom, and criticized human-rights abuses during the crackdown on demonstrations that accompanied the March election that returned Vladimir Putin to the presidency.
尽管以色列在黎巴嫩无功而返，巴勒斯坦流血内讧意味着双方都受挫了，然而，实现突破尽管可能，但依旧是不大可能。	While Israel’s non-victory in Lebanon and the Palestinians’ bloody divisions mean that both sides have been humbled, a breakthrough, though possible, remains unlikely.
损失还包括没有保护世界日益减少的野生物种以及快速衰退的生态系统。 在维持生命服务的意义上，这些都价值数以万亿计美元。	The losses also include failure to conserve the world’s dwindling wildlife and rapidly degrading ecosystems, which are worth trillions of dollars in terms of life-supporting services.
如果我今年为某种商品或服务支付了和去年一样的价格，但这些东西的质量有所改善，那么我的生活水平显然有所提高。	If I pay the same price for some product or service this year as I did last year, but the quality of the product or service is better, my standard of living has increased.
同时，低利率环境下的充分就业可以消灭食利阶层 — — 那些靠利息和租金来存活的人。 适度的财富再分配是凯恩斯经济学理论较为激进的政治理念，但政府的干预也应有一定的限度。	As long as “the state is able to determine the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the instruments [i.e., the capital base] and the basic reward to those who own them,” there is no “obvious case” for further involvement.
今年11月布朗的公民投票将把加州个人所得税的最高税率提高到13.3 % ， 这也是美国各地所得税率的最高值。	Brown’s ballot initiative this November would raise California’s top personal income-tax rate to 13.3%, the nation’s highest.
但让可以互相勾结保护自身集体利益的寡头拥有媒体所有权同样危险 — — 他们的利益可能与社会其他成员截然不同。	But so is ownership of media by oligarchs who can collude with one another to protect their collective interests – interests that may differ sharply from those of the rest of society.
1月15日，瑞士国民银行出人意料地宣布放弃盯住欧元 — — 一个月前它还在重申盯住欧元的承诺 — — 曾经严守纪律的瑞士国民银行已经顾不上时间一致性的信誉要求了。	By unexpectedly abandoning the euro peg on January 15 – just a month after reiterating a commitment to it – the once-disciplined SNB has run roughshod over the credibility requirements of time consistency.
在经济复苏中更宽泛的“改善体验”因素缺位，对经济不平等状况的不满，对国际政治领导人的不信任，以及人们对地方主义的更广泛接纳：这些才是英国大选竞选的主要特征。	The absence of a broader “feel good” factor from economic recovery, resentment of economic inequality, mistrust of national political leaders, and greater faith in localism: these are the main features of Britain’s election campaign.
最新研究表明，电动汽车价格要到2026年才能与混合动力车相当，到2032年才能等同于常规汽车，到时政府补贴总量将达到1000—1500亿欧元。	Recent research indicates that electric cars may reach break-even price with hybrids only in 2026, and with conventional cars in 2032, after governments spend €100-150 billion in subsidies.
美联储和财政部反对着手干预，这显示了他们对于“仅仅保护商业银行是不能拯救金融体系的”这一点上理解得太慢。	The opposition of the Federal Reserve and Treasury to hands-on intervention meant that they were slow to understand that merely ring-fencing the commercial banks could not save the financial system.
美国给伊斯兰民族和伊斯兰世界带来了深重灾难，大量伊拉克平民在这场美国发动的对伊战争中被打死，并且暴力活动还将进一步升级，死亡人数持续上升。	The US is killing massive numbers of Iraqi civilians, embittering the population and the Islamic world, and laying the ground for escalating violence and death.
当大规模杀伤性武器并没有发现时，美国和其微小（而且不断萎缩的 ） “ 自愿联盟”编造了新的理由，即为民主而战。	When weapons of mass destruction were not found, the US and its small (and dwindling) “coalition of the willing” conjured up a new rationale – the struggle for democracy.
某些药品研究人员预计，随着对人类基因组理解不断加深，医生最终可以提前15年到20年预测疾病，并且立即开始预防疾病治疗。	Some drug researchers predict that with continuing advances in understanding the human genome, doctors may eventually be able to predict illnesses 15-20 years in advance, and begin prophylactic treatment immediately.
虽然美国经济面临种种困难，美元以其不可比拟的深度及美国市场良好的流动性一直把持着各国外汇储备的比重。	Despite the trials and tribulations of the American economy, dollar securities remain the dominant form of reserves because of the unparalleled depth and liquidity of US markets.
2010年希腊所获得的IMF资源“特殊待遇”为“累计不超过”该国IMF份额（其对IMF的金融承担额）的600 % 。	"The “exceptional access"" to IMF resources granted to Greece in 2010 was set at a “cumulative limit of 600%"" of the country's IMF quota, a measure of a country's financial commitment to the IMF."
正如盖伊·川琦（Guy Kawasaki）在其关于苹果公司的著作中所明智指出的那样，这个品牌实质上创造了“魅力 ” 。	As brilliantly explained by Guy Kawasaki in his book on the company, the brand essentially created “enchantment.”
可悲的是，我发现克纳委员会报告中最著名的论断 — — “我们的国家正在分裂成为两个社会群体，一个是黑人，一个是白人 — — 既互相隔离又不平等 ” — —在今天依然有效。	Sadly, the Kerner Commission report’s most famous line – “Our Nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white – separate and unequal” – still rings true.
这些国家不仅都存在经济和政策疲软（财政和经常项目双重赤字、增长减缓、通胀抬头、停滞不前的结构性改革 ） ， 还都将在今年举行总统或议会选举。	All have in common not only economic and policy weaknesses (twin fiscal and current-account deficits, slowing growth and rising inflation, sluggish structural reforms), but also presidential or parliamentary elections this year.
在私人生活中，美国人已经深陷于消费主义无法自拔，而消费主义则反过来吞噬了美国人的时间、金钱、精力，以及致力于集体福祉的倾向。	In their private lives, Americans have become addicted to consumerism, which drains their time, savings, attention, and inclination to engage in acts of collective compassion.
这些关键改革方面的进展一直令人失望，有的国家用力多（如西班牙和爱尔兰 ） ， 有的国家用力少（意大利和法国是其中之二 ） 。	Progress on such vital reforms has been disappointing, with more effort made in some countries (Spain and Ireland, for example) and less in others (Italy and France, to cite just two).
就像去年美国那场程度有限的导弹攻击一样，最近的打击行动一样没法阻止对方在未来使用化学武器，更无力威胁阿萨德政权的生存。	Like the limited US missile strikes last year, the recent attack will not deter the future use of chemical weapons, much less threaten the survival of Assad’s regime.
伦敦—在很多批评家眼里，欧洲货币联盟看上去极像1913年之前的金本位 — — 在大相径庭的经济体间维系固定汇率。	LONDON – The European Monetary Union, as many of its critics maintain, looks a lot like the pre-1913 gold standard, which imposed fixed exchange rates on extremely diverse economies.
没有了来自中国的廉价太阳能电池板，推动欧洲行业发展的补贴又因为财政原因锐减，太阳能在欧洲所占的份额恐怕远远达不到环保主义者的预期。	With the loss of cheap solar panels from China, and with subsidies that helped to drive the European industry now reduced for fiscal reasons, the share of solar power in Europe will fall far short of environmentalists’ goals.
医疗保健体系常常无法以患者可以承受的价格向他们提供所需治疗，而医疗创新也并不能解决公共健康需求，因此现状是不可持续的。	With health-care systems often failing to provide patients with the treatment they need at a price they can afford, and with health innovation not addressing public health needs, the status quo is not sustainable.
Mesurer la qualité des résultats a beau être un exercice délicat, The Times Higher Education Supplement tente de le faire chaque année.	Measuring the quality of output is difficult, although The Times Higher Education Supplement attempts to do so every year.
与此同时，越来越多的移民 — — 通常来自穆斯林占多数的国家 — — 开始在欧洲各大城市定居，导致了主流政党无力充分反应的社会冲突。	At the same time, more and more immigrants, often from Muslim-majority countries, settled in European cities, resulting in social tensions, to which mainstream parties were unable to respond adequately.
我们需要建立不会因为爆发被控制住就马上被撤销的研究项目，这能够极大地丰富我们更好地管理下一次传染病暴发的办法。	By creating research grants that do not expire as soon as an outbreak is under control, we would substantially increase our portfolio of solutions to manage the next epidemic better.
阿克拉—在最近举行的卢旺达基加利峰会上，44个非洲国家首脑签署了一份新自由贸易协定。 该协定旨在改变地区营商方式。	ACCRA – At a recent summit in Kigali, Rwanda, 44 African heads of state signed a new free-trade agreement aimed at changing the way the region does business.
伊斯兰教将树立伊斯兰教敌对势力作为解决地区弊端的方法，从而导致非穆斯林的边缘化，其中包括许多几百年来在地区经济、文化和政治生活中扮演重要角色的群体。	By promoting Islamic revival as a solution to the region’s ills, Islamism led to the marginalization of non-Muslims, including groups that had played outsize roles in the region’s economic, cultural, and political life for centuries.
在最初的近似（first approximation）中，低碳路径是主要战略，并产生了完全不同也远远更加有利的起作用的激励结构观。	On a first approximation, low-carbon paths are the dominant strategies, implying a completely different and far more favorable view of the incentive structures at work.
关于美国海军陆战队往冲绳县普天间空军基地部署12架V-22鱼鹰式倾转旋翼飞机的争议加剧了该联盟的衰败。	Controversy over the deployment by the US Marines of 12 tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey aircraft to the Futenma Air Base on Okinawa has contributed to the alliance’s decay.
但是，即便是新加坡模式的法治也要比资本主义更加困难，而它的缺失是亚洲要按照欧盟模式建立一个共同体最主要的障碍所在。	But the rule of law, even Singapore-style, is far harder to implement than capitalism, and its absence represents the major obstacle to the establishment of an Asian community based on the EU model.
作为一个人均收入2500美元和35 ％的劳动力仍从事农业的发展中国家，其工人每年收入只有约600美元，中国国内的问题仍然是巨大的。	As a developing country with US$ 2,500 per capita income and 35% of its labor force still in agriculture, where workers earn only about $600 per year, China’s domestic problems remain enormous.
自拉宾和阿拉法特握手以来，大约7500巴勒斯坦人和1400以色列人被杀，受伤和被监禁的更是不计其数。	Since Rabin and Arafat shook hands, roughly 7,500 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis have been killed, and many more have been injured or jailed.
正如哲学家按照真理的本质和对本质的理解分为不同的学派一样，经济学也按照真实世界中的运行模式进行了区分。	Just as philosophers are divided on the nature of truth and understanding, economics is divided on the workings of the real world.
由于发达国家不愿向发展中国家的廉价产品开放市场，而发展中国家也力求保护自己现有的新生工业，多哈回合贸易谈判陷入了僵局。	The Doha Round of trade negotiations is stalled because developed countries do not want to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries, which in turn try to protect what nascent industries they have.
2014年12月24日，就在欧洲法院裁决6天后，科学家发表了他们从人类表皮细胞制造基本卵子和精子细胞的研究成果。	On December 24, 2014, just six days after the ECJ’s ruling, scientists published the results of their efforts to make rudimentary egg and sperm cells starting from a person’s skin cells.
但是，凭他的资质 — — 他精通汉语，又是建设性政策思想家，与美国和中国的重要人物有着长期紧密的个人关系 — — 他的观点必须认真对待。	But, given his credentials – he is a formidable Chinese linguist and creative policy thinker, with long and close personal relationships with key figures in both the US and China – his argument must be taken seriously.
我们需要撒切尔夫人那样的勇气，需要比尔·克林顿那种能引导选民把自身利益与政治家目标融为一体的超凡政治游说力。	We need the sort of courage that was the hallmark of Margaret Thatcher. We need Bill Clinton’s extraordinary ability to spin a political narrative that enabled voters to identify their own interests with his goals.
如果伊朗有诚意，结果就有可能是人们期待已久的“总体协议 ” ， 也就是以伊朗为一方，美国、欧洲以及美国的地区盟友为另一方的地区性和解。	If Iran is serious, the result may be nothing less than the long awaited “Grand Bargain” – a regional reconciliation of interests between Iran, on one side, and America, Europe, and the region’s US allies on the other.
随着伊朗盟国或代理在叙利亚、伊拉克、黎巴嫩和也门的日渐活跃，沙特领导人越来越感到被周边的伊朗势力所包围。	With Iranian allies or proxies operating in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, Saudi Arabia’s leaders have felt increasingly surrounded.
纳兰达在那个时候接收了成千上万的中国学生，并且有些印度人也来到中国；有一位印度僧人在五世纪的时候在杭州建立了著名的灵隐寺。	Nalanda received hundreds of Chinese students in its time, and a few Indians went the other way; a Buddhist monk from India built the famous Lingyin Si temple in Huangzhou in the fifth century.
虽然欧洲接收了来自叙利亚，利比亚和阿富汗等国的大量移民，但是很多新来者都基本没有受过教育，让这些人实现就业极为困难。	Europe has experienced significant immigration from countries such as Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan; but many of the newcomers have little education, and finding them employment has proved difficult.
其他经济学家（主要是欧洲经济学家）认为希腊必须扮演与其经济重要性相当的政治角色，必须接受主权分享（和债务共担）安排以确保货币联盟的凝聚力和可持续性。	Other economists, mainly in Europe, argue that Germany must assume a political role befitting its economic preeminence and must accept sovereignty-sharing (and burden-sharing) arrangements to ensure the monetary union’s cohesion and sustainability.
因此，消除贸易赤字需要将2.5%的美国实际产量转移到世界其他国家，以及让GDP真实值再下降2.7%的进出口价格变化。	Thus, eliminating the trade deficit would require shifting about 2.5% of US physical production to the rest of the world, as well as a change in export and import prices that reduces their real value by another 2.7% of GDP.
当市场意识到这一过程即将来临时，将把意大利主权利率推到更低水平。 由于意大利沉重的国民债务负担，利息支付将增加超过GDP的5%的财政赤字。	When the markets see that coming, they will drive Italy’s sovereign interest rates even lower. Given Italy’s very large national debt, interest payments add more than 5% of GDP to the fiscal deficit.
讽刺的是，美国 — — 欧洲最大的盟友、欧盟最大的贸易伙伴 — — 最后也可能从中获益，但如果推定共和党提名人唐纳德·特朗普赢得11月总统大选的话，美国就可能无法获得好处。	Ironically, the United States – Europe’s greatest ally and the EU’s largest trading partner – may also end up as a beneficiary, though not if Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, wins the presidential election in November.
更有甚者，绝大多数的服务市场¾证券交易、批零流通、企业服务和本地设施¾依旧置于政府的保护之下，不受竞争和自由流通规则的约束。	Moreover, most markets for services - securities trading, wholesale and retail distribution, business services, and local utilities - remain sheltered from competition and free circulation rules.
在六月底举行的会议上，欧洲领导人首次承认了此次危机具有多面性，他们承认实行内部整顿的紧缩政策并不能解决��题。	At their meeting at the end of June, European leaders acknowledged for the first time the multiple dimensions of the crisis, accepting that austerity – putting everyone’s house in order – will not suffice.
类似地，俄罗斯及其金砖国家伙伴（巴西、印度、中国和南非）正在成立一个开发银行，作为西方控制的国际货币基金组织和世界银行的替代品。	Likewise, Russia and its BRICS partners (Brazil, India, China, and South Africa) are creating a development bank that is to serve as an alternative to the Western-controlled International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
中国和日本这些大国的经济联系变得越来越紧密 — — 不仅仅是贸易额的持续增长，还有直接投资和地区产品网络的加强。	Economic relations between major players such as China and Japan are increasingly close – owing not only to booming trade, but also to direct investment and regional production networks.
让全世界二十亿无法获得银行服务的人走出阴影，进入主流金融体系需要监管者、私人部门、非营利组织、地区机构和国际组织之间的新合作。	Bringing the world’s two billion unbanked people out of the shadows and into the mainstream financial system will require new partnerships among regulators, the private sector, non-profits, regional bodies, and international organizations.
但他们没能给人民带来更好的生活，加上左翼思想因为苏联解体而失去信誉，于是产生了敌对运动 — — 政治伊斯兰教。	But their failure to deliver better lives to their citizens, together with the discrediting of left-wing ideologies following the Soviet Union’s collapse, fueled the rise of a rival movement: political Islam.
事实上，政治分析家谢尔盖·卡拉加诺夫（Sergei Karaganov）在2009年时指出，俄罗斯缺少软实力正是其激进行事的原因 — — 比如前年与格鲁吉亚的战争。	Indeed, as the political analyst Sergei Karaganov noted in 2009, Russia’s lack of soft power is precisely what is driving it to behave aggressively – such as in its war with Georgia the previous year.
但如果这种观点正确，那么我们现在应该看到大量长期资本流出以及中国外汇市场上出现大量抛售人民币换取美元的现象。	But if that were true, we would now be seeing significant long-term capital outflows and heavy selling of RMB for dollars in China’s foreign-exchange market.
以美国为首的北约在1999年对塞尔维亚的轰炸便未受到国际法的认可，并且是在塞尔维亚盟国俄罗斯的强烈反对下发生的。	The US-led NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 lacked the sanction of international law, and occurred despite the strong objections of Russia, a Serbian ally.
中国政府成功地以这种方式阻止股价崩盘似乎证明了马克思主义的观点，即经济和金融危机不会出现在控制经济当中。	In this manner, China’s government managed to stop a rout, seemingly reinforcing the Marxist view that economic and financial crises do not occur in controlled economies.
相反，2007年，109位民主党众议员投票赞成美国-秘鲁贸易促进协定（US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement ） ， 原因正是其条款根据5月协定的要求做出了相应调整。	In 2007, by contrast, 109 House Democrats voted in favor of the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, precisely because its terms had been adjusted as requested and in line with the May agreement.
奥巴马可能会意识到，当自己是世界唯一超级大国的领袖时，如果想得到人们的尊敬，就得至少要让别人有点害怕你。	Obama may have come to understand that when you are the leader of the world’s only superpower, you need to be feared just a little if you are to be respected.
在出现了最近的误算的情况下，我们必须校准我们的政治雷达 — — 而这意味着考虑一切潜在干扰源，而不只是符合条理的干扰源。	In the wake of recent miscalculations, we must recalibrate our political radars – and that means accounting for all potential sources of interference, not just those that fit a neat narrative.
一开始，通过全球央行资产负债表的扩张（2009年规模达5万亿美元）给了银行避免倒闭所需要的廉价资金。	Initially, balance-sheet expansion – by $5 trillion since 2009 – provided banks with the cheap funding they needed to avoid failure.
中国在2017年那让人惊叹的1.5万亿美元的扩张规模意味着，从名义GDP层面它实质上创造了一个与韩国同等大小，相当于瑞士的2倍，瑞典的3倍的新经济体。	China’s staggering $1.5 trillion expansion in 2017 means that, in nominal terms, it essentially created a new economy the size of South Korea, twice the size of Switzerland, and three times the size of Sweden.
新加坡 — — 上个月，在多年的犹豫不决之后，巴基斯坦军方在北瓦济里斯坦部落机构展开了清剿恐怖分子基地和结束该地区无法无天状况的全面军事行动。	SINGAPORE – Last month, after years of indecision, Pakistan’s military launched a full-scale military operation in the North Waziristan Tribal Agency aimed at eliminating terrorist bases and ending the region’s lawlessness.
例如，我深信，多年来在金融服务市场的供给方面，金融机构通过其组织良好且强有力的游说工作，对政府部门有许多“监管俘虏 ” （ regulatory capture ） 。	I am convinced, for example, that over the years there has been too much “regulatory capture” by the supply side of the financial services market, with its well-organized and powerful lobbies.
对叙利亚而言，这意味着现有政府的组成部分，包括阿萨德的阿拉维派在内，均应与反对派和库尔德人一道加入到全面联盟。	For Syria, this means that part of the existing state, including Assad’s Alawite sect, should be included in a broad coalition, along with the opposition and the Kurds.
德国海军的大型补给舰 — — 可以在拯救地中海难民的行动中派上大用场 — — 因为缺少备用部件，而18个月 无法执行任务。	The German Navy’s large supply ships – those most useful for refugee rescue operations in the Mediterranean – will be out of commission for 18 months, owing to a lack of spare parts.
积累了大量未偿还债务的银行随之缩小贷款规模，而尽管各国政府及中央银行大肆出手干预，此次危机还是把全球经济拖下了水。	Banks with substantial overhanging debt reduced lending, and, despite the massive intervention of governments and central banks, the crisis dragged down the global economy.
国际货币基金组织还应该更为主动，在体制上重要的国家更为直言不讳。 在这些国家中，金融监管和危机管理的缺点已经显现出来。	The IMF should also be more proactive and speak with greater candor in systemically important countries, where shortcomings in financial supervision and crisis management have appeared.
在政治谈判这个清晰明了的交换条件背后，来自法塔赫和哈马斯的谈判代表还负有让哈马斯广受欢迎的政治信仰与法塔赫传统的世俗抱负互相融合的职责。	Underneath this clear-cut quid pro quo of political bargaining, the representatives from Fatah and Hamas are charged with finding the means to reconcile Hamas’s tremendously popular political ideology with Fatah’s traditional secular aspirations.
该数据将中国2011年度的投资收入逆差从268亿美元调整为853亿美元 — — 这一重大修改不但令人开始怀疑中国国际收支统计的可信度，还暴露出了经济发展路径中存在的一个问题。	The data adjusted China’s investment-income deficit for 2011 from $26.8 billion to $85.3 billion – a massive revision that casts doubt on the reliability of China’s balance-of-payments statistics and exposes a flaw in the economy’s growth path.
欧盟宪法条约在法国和荷兰公投中所遭遇的挫败看来已经引发新的舆论导向，即应该放缓欧盟进一步扩张的脚步，甚至应该停止。	The defeat of the EU’s Constitutional Treaty in referendums in France and the Netherlands has, it seems, given rise to a new consensus that further enlargement of the Union should be slowed down, or even stopped.
例如，如果伊朗的核试验活动周围有足够的伊朗自愿接受的检查和控制，那我们可以有信心在早期阶段探测到任何这样的活动转向军事目的。	For example, if Iran’s nuclear activities were to be surrounded with enough voluntarily accepted checks and controls, we could be confident of detecting at an early stage any diversion toward military purposes.
她控诉说当时自己“太出名 ” 、 “太活跃”和“太受压 ” ， 并且她对毛的妻子江青如何迫害叶剑英一家以及叶剑英的孩子如何入狱提供了大量具体的细节。	She complained that she was “too famous,” “too active,” and “too stressed” at the time, and she provided extensive details about how Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, persecuted the Ye family and how the Ye children went to prison.
但特朗普虽然欣欣然为美国的仇恨思想煽风点火，他倒并非是始作俑者，正如退欧派也不是英国乱象的始作俑者。	But while Trump has gleefully fanned the flames of hatred in the US, he did not kindle them, just as the Brexiteers did not do so in the UK.
问题在于卢卡斯的说法只适合一些经济增长模型，这些模型有严格的假设，即“包含的”资本回报会随着资本的积累趋近于零。	The problem is that Lucas’s statement is true only for models of economic growth that are specified in such a way that the return on “embodied” capital drops to zero as capital accumulates.
这些西方人同时也认为俄罗斯政治的传统就是每一个新“沙皇”都力图在一定程度上否定其前任的遗产，因此也会在每一个时代之初迎来一段政治解冻期。	They also view Russia in terms of a tradition whereby every new tsar partly repudiates the legacy of his predecessor, creating a political thaw at the beginning of a new reign.
这部还未上映就获得好评的影片表现了���群反对拿破仑统治的西班牙游击队员被带到一堵墙边等待执行死刑。	The pre-credit sequence shows a group of Spanish guerrillas during the insurgency against Napoleon being led to a wall where they are to be executed by firing squad.
但铁幕降落、这一划时代的事件过去二十年后，仍有类似的铁幕环绕着古巴，使得今年的纪念更加令人感到刻骨铭心。	That 20 years after this epochal event an iron curtain remains around Cuba makes this anniversary poignant.
与她的丈夫不同 — — 比尔·克林顿在总统任上支持并签署了多项自由贸易协定 — — 克林顿正在逐渐转向民主党中的保护主义阵营。	Unlike her husband, who supported and signed free-trade agreements during his presidency, Clinton is inching closer to the protectionist wing of the Democratic Party.
毕竟 ， “ 波将金村”是在叶卡捷琳娜大帝统治时期发明的。 在女皇巡游全国之时，这些村落以色彩明快的外立面掩盖了叶卡捷琳娜的农奴们污秽的生活。	After all, it was during the reign of Catherine the Great that the “Potemkin village” was invented, whereby the squalor of the lives of Catherine’s serfs was hidden behind cheerfully painted housing façades as the Empress toured her country.
不久前，一位日本某电视节目的代表要求采访我。 这个节目与一家偏自由派立场的报纸有关，采访的内容是首相安倍晋三的经济改革战略，即“安倍经济学 ” 。	Not long ago, representatives from a Japanese television program associated with a liberal-leaning newspaper requested an interview with me to discuss Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic-reform strategy, known as “Abenomics.”
事实上，众所周知，平均产妇死亡率很难估计，因为冲突、贫困、基础设施薄弱、医疗系统薄弱和资源不足导致未能上报许多死亡案例。	In fact, MMRs are notoriously difficult to estimate, with conflict, poverty, poor infrastructure, weak health systems, and inadequate resources causing many deaths to go unreported.
有发展政策经验的人都知道，财政转移支付无法产生趋同增长，除非有深度社会变革配合 — — 而这要求积极的地方领导。	As anyone with experience in development policy knows, fiscal transfers cannot generate convergence growth, unless they are backed by deep societal changes – and that demands active local leadership.
那些例外情况可以被定义为IMF与成员国之间所谓第四条（Article IV）磋商的一部分 — — 某种强化IMF对该国监控程度的手段。	Exceptions could be identified as part of the IMF’s so-called Article IV consultations with members – an approach that would strengthen IMF country surveillance.
政府需要营造一种透明文化，以确保融资用于生产用途 — — 而不是被非法挪用，或带着政治目的用于低增加值项目。	Governments will need to foster a culture of transparency to ensure that financing is put to productive use – rather than illicitly syphoned off or directed to low-value-added projects for political purposes.
比如，跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership，TPP）表明了奥巴马与占全球贸易三分之一、全球GDP百分之四十的地区形成一致的决心。	For example, the negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) reflect President Obama’s determination to strike an accord with countries that represent one-third of global trade and 40% of global GDP.
"当世界各国的领导人们在四年前的""千年峰会""上会晤时，他们就一系列旨在到2015年将全球贫困减少一半的远期目标达成共识。"	When the world's leaders met at the Millennium Summit four years ago, they agreed on a set of goals aimed at cutting global poverty in half by 2015.
它仿佛喊出了在生命某一阶段中男性内心深处的渴望 — — 当然也表达了那些喜欢这类电影和电视节目的女性的内心渴望，那是一个人可以投奔自由，冒险和重塑自我的人生阶段，同时也是不受社会关系和家庭责任束缚的阶段。	It seems to speak to a deep longing in men – and in the women who also enjoy these films and TV shows – for a time in one’s life when one could dash toward freedom, adventure, and self-reinvention, unencumbered by social ties and family obligations.
在美国，设限+交易原本应当被视为一个共和党方案：其背后的支持者都是那些自认为倾向市场而非偏好管制的人。	Cap and trade was originally supposed to be a Republican idea in the US: its backers were those who considered themselves pro-market, not those who considered themselves pro-regulation.
武契奇和萨奇能留下什么样的政治遗产将在很大程度上取决于他们制定与欧盟基本价值观相符的现实提案的意愿。	Vučić and Thaçi’s legacies will largely depend on their willingness to formulate a realistic proposal that aligns with the foundational values of the EU.
奥朗德的参照点似乎是他年轻时那种二战后的田园牧歌，一个飞速增长的时代，人口年龄分布恢复到合理水平，没什么移民，也缺乏全球竞争。	Hollande’s reference point seems to be the post-war idyll of his youth, a time of rapid growth, demographic recovery, scarce immigration, and scant global competition.
但2009年来 — — 那也是经济衰退最糟糕的年份 — — 全球经济平均增长率为3.3 % ， 与20世纪80年代和90年代大致相同。	But since 2009 – the worst year of the recession – the global economy has grown at an average rate of 3.3%, just as it did in the 1980s and 1990s.
因此结论就是尚未达到相对“安全”的门槛的国家对于解除资本控制应该保持谨慎，但是对于达到门槛的国家则应该尽量掘取可观的净利益。	One conclusion, therefore, is for countries to be cautious about removing capital controls when they have not yet reached the relevant “safety” thresholds, but equally to stress the sizable net benefits for countries that exceed the thresholds.
而IMF也确实给其希腊贷款加上了条件 — — 包括财政紧缩、私有化和退休金和税收制度的结构改革 — — 其中大部分条件都是解决希腊资不抵债问题不可或缺的措施。	And the IMF did impose conditions on its loans to Greece – including fiscal austerity, privatization, and structural reform of its pension and tax systems – most of which were necessary to address the country’s insolvency.
荷兰和美国央行都直接参与监督银行系统，它们在识别潜在系统性问题方面并不比其他国家的非央行监管者更有效。	The Dutch and American central banks, with direct oversight of their banking systems, were no more effective in identifying potentially dangerous systemic issues than were non-central bank regulators elsewhere.
他的第一个行动方针应该是与联合国机构，国际组织负责人以及世界领导人召开会议，制定一个协调一致共同努力的议程以保护世界各地的年轻人。	His first course of action should be to call a meeting with the heads of UN agencies and international organizations, as well as world leaders, to create an agenda for concerted and coordinated efforts to protect young people everywhere.
最近几年，虽然国际货币基金组织和世界银行逐渐成为世界上最贫穷国家的唯一贷款人，但是，它们的贷款数量却都在急剧减少。	In recent years, lending by both institutions contracted dramatically, even though they have increasingly become the exclusive lenders to the world’s poorest countries.
这些北约国家的执政者现在想要的 — — 或者至少他们知道他们需要的 — — 是美国的指示、引导和支持。	What those who govern the NATO countries now want – or at least what they know they need – is US guidance, direction, and support.
事实上，美联储官员没有证明在做出正确预测方面的无能已经促使他们更新了模型，这正在让很多人失去对美联储做出可靠决策的能力的信心。	Indeed, the failure of officials to convey how their inability to make accurate predictions has prompted them to update their model is leading many to lose confidence in the Fed’s capacity for sound decision-making.
自然选择为诸如哺乳动物的眼睛，鸟类的翅膀，以及植物将光转变成为糖类的能力这样多样化的特性提供了科学的解释。	Natural selection has provided scientific explanations of traits as diverse as the mammalian eye, the bird’s wing, and the ability of plants to transform light into sugars.
自从艾哈迈德内贾德去年访问巴西以后，伊朗与就核问题展开谈判的国家间的关系就发生了恶化。 在艾哈迈德内贾德颇受争议地再次当选之后，这种恶化就发生了。	Relations between Iran and the countries that are negotiating the nuclear question have deteriorated since Ahmadinejad’s visit to Brazil last year, which came soon after his disputed re-election.
但这里有一个根本性区别：反对控枪的民主党这样做是有悖于本党官方立场的；而共和党这样做是契合本党立场的。	But there is a fundamental difference: Democrats who oppose gun controls do so in defiance of their party’s official program, whereas Republicans do so in conformity with theirs.
审计办公室的任务很简单：在布朗和维特的要求下，它不得不对政府给予大型银行控股公司的隐性担保的规模和影响做一个评估。	The GAO had a simple task: At the request of Brown and Vitter, it was charged with assessing the scale and impact of the implicit guarantees provided by the government to large bank holding companies.
发自墨西哥城 — — 在即将到来的7月1日，墨西哥人很可能会将曾经统治该国70年的革命制度党（Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI）再次选上权力宝座。	MEXICO CITY – On July 1, Mexico will in all likelihood vote the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled the country for seven decades, back into power.
我们已经在苹果的iPhone上看到了新范式的线索，iPhone可以进行手指动作识别，但是在智能技术界，概念可视化非常激进，以至于绝大多数的普通用户可能都不能意识到它是什么东西。	We’ve seen hints of a new paradigm in Apple’s iPhone, which allows gestural finger motions, but in the intelligence community, concept visualization can be so radical that most ordinary users might barely recognize what it was.
这看上去也是只是边际进步，但实际上相对于通常十分缓慢的结构变化速度已是相当迅速 — — 中国的结构变化直到2011年才根据十二五规划开始实施。	That may seem like marginal progress, but it is actually quite rapid relative to the normally glacial pace of structural change – a process that began in China only in 2011 with the enactment of the 12th Five-Year Plan.
其一与两个主要核大国 — — 俄罗斯和美国 — — 是否准备好了从旅行它们所签署的新战略核武器削减条约（New START）削减库存承诺迈向完全消除它们的核武库。	One is related to the readiness of the two major nuclear powers, Russia and the United States, to move from the stockpile reductions to which they agreed in the New START treaty to complete elimination of their nuclear arsenals.
如果说这些国家犯了一个错误的话，只是如同今天的德国一样 — — 太轻信市场了。 因此他们才像美国及其他国家一样允许资产泡沫恣意生长。	If these countries made a mistake, it was only that, like Germany today, they were overly credulous of markets, so they (like the United States and so many others) allowed an asset bubble to grow unchecked.
如果通货膨胀增加确实比美联储预期的更快，美联储或许将被迫更快地提高利率，给金融市场乃至整体经济造成不利影响。	If inflation does rise faster than the Fed expects, it may be forced to increase interest rates rapidly, with adverse effects on financial markets and potentially on the broader economy.
结果是，穆尔西的激励变成了巩固权力，而不是起草包容性宪法；在全民公投中，穆斯林兄弟会支持的宪法草案获得了64%的选民支持，但投票比例只有33 % 。	As a result, Morsi’s incentives were to consolidate power rather than produce an inclusive constitution; put to a referendum, the draft backed by the Brotherhood was approved by 64% of voters, but with a turnout of just 33%.
但如果我们未使用的数据能够被公开调阅，我们就可能吸引新的合作者重新启动这项研究 — — 还有可能启动效果更好的分析。	If our unused data were openly available, however, we could attract new collaborators to return to it – and potentially generate stronger analyses.
欧洲拉比大会主席戈德施密特（Pinchas Goldschmidt）最近评论说，你不可能以犹太人的过去为荣，又告诉今天的犹太人他们的宗教行为不再受欢迎了。	As Pinchas Goldschmidt, President of the Conference of European Rabbis, recently remarked, one cannot be proud of the Jews of yesterday and tell the Jews of today that their religious practices are no longer welcome.
但如果他有信心汇率将保持稳定，他就不需要约束工资 — — 而中国目前的年工资增长已经达到了10—15 % 。	But if he can be confident that the exchange rate will remain stable, he will not need to restrain wages – and China has experienced 10-15% annual wage growth already.
事实上，我们的研究表明，若互相承诺协议包括严格的来源国限制，则地区内贸易将增加，与其他国家的贸易会削弱，发展中国家损失最大。	Indeed, our research shows that when mutual-recognition agreements include restrictive rules of origin, intra-regional trade increases – at the expense of trade with other countries – and that developing countries tend to suffer most.
而这也是撰写博客回应蔡美儿文章的Betty Ming Liu的观点 ： “ 蔡美儿式的家长就是我这样的华裔美国人接受心理治疗的原因 ” 。	That’s also the view of Betty Ming Liu, who blogged in response to Chua’s article: “Parents like Amy Chua are the reason why Asian-Americans like me are in therapy.”
正如拉尔夫·奥萨向美国国家经济研究局提交的工作报告所显示的那样，如果德国没有利用��际市场，其生活水平可能只有现在的一半左右。	As Ralph Ossa showed in a working paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research, if Germany did not have access to international markets, its standard of living would be half of what it is now.
毕竟，成就美国的国家 — — 特别是中国等出口拉动经济体及其依赖资源的供应链 — — 从美国的消费狂热中获益，因为这大大刺激了全球贸易的扩张。	After all, the enablers – especially export-led economies like China, along with its resource-dependent supply chain – benefited from America’s consumption binge, as it drove an outsize expansion of global trade.
最后，美非领导人峰会的规格相当高，有40多个国家的元首出席，奥巴马总统也直接参与了峰会，这使得非洲话题成了热门。	Finally, the high profile of the US-Africa Leaders Summit, with more than 40 heads of state in attendance, as well as President Barack Obama’s direct involvement, generated buzz about Africa.
在2014年，中国非汽车行业每一万名员工中仅有11台机器人，而在汽车组装线上213台机器人则对应着每万名员工。	In 2014, China had just 11 robots per 10,000 employees in non-automotive industries, and just 213 per 10,000 employees on automotive assembly lines.
这项运动开始于突尼斯，该国爆发的革命将总统宰因·阿比丁·本·阿里的专制政权赶下台来，随后蔓延到埃及和利比亚，结束了穆巴拉克和卡扎菲更残暴、更腐败的政权统治。	It started in Tunisia, where the revolution swept President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s repressive regime out of power. It then spread to Egypt and Libya, ending Hosni Mubarak’s and Muammar el-Qaddafi’s even more repressive and corrupt regimes.
但上述推理有一个危险的弱点：即假定合法卡特尔 — — 即需求管理的拟议模式之一 — — 会因为低成本向市场提供象牙而挤出非法的象牙供应。	But this line of reasoning has a dangerous weakness: It assumes that a legal cartel – one proposed model for regulating supply – would crowd out illegal suppliers by providing ivory to the market at a lower cost.
所采取的对策必须与一个世纪前完成普及中等教育、以及开始于20世纪60年代的大学教育普及运动具有同等的规模。	The response must be on par with the establishment of universal secondary education a century ago, or with the “college for all” movement that began in the 1960s.
这些运动，如相当公开化的“足够 ” （ Barakat）运动，鼓励阿尔及利亚人从愤怒而消极的弃权转为积极的抵制。	Such movements, like the much-publicized “Barakat” (“Enough”), have encouraged a shift among Algerians from resentful abstention to active boycott.
近日，巴西成功抵抗艾滋病、莫桑比克成功抗击疟疾以及中国抵御肺结核的例子，显示了全球范围内更多资源所能带来的成功，并产生了一种新方式将援助发放至最需要它的地方。	Recent successes in Brazil against AIDS, in Mozambique against malaria, and in China against TB, show what can be achieved on a global scale with more resources. There are new ways of directing aid to where it is most needed.
十九世纪初，担心被取代驱使约克夏和兰开夏的纺织工人 — — 即“卢德分子 ” — —砸毁自动纺纱机和织布框架等机器。	In the early nineteenth century, fear of such dislocation drove textile workers in Yorkshire and Lancashire – the “Luddites” – to smash new machines like automated looms and knitting frames.
凭良心说，我无法“无脑站边”任何法国、意大利或希腊所提出的再分配方案，如果这些方案有违公正原则的话。	I could not, in good conscience, side credibly with any French, Italian, or Greek proponent of redistribution if their proposals violated the principles of rectitude.
这些称雄一时的团体不愿意变革或者合作，也无法制订出吸引选民的方法干脆就消亡了，从而让正义和发展党控制了保守派选民根基。	Unwilling to change or work together, and unable to devise ways of appealing to voters, these once-powerful groups simply disappeared, leaving the AKP largely in control of the conservative electoral base.
土耳其、伊朗、沙特阿拉伯、以色列、俄罗斯和美国往往各有各的算盘，这一事实更加意味着可能出现没有法律基础的混乱未来。	The fact that Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Russia, and the United States are working at cross-purposes more often than not further suggests a messy future without legal foundation.
像基尔特·怀尔德斯（Geert Wilders）这样的北欧煽动者则将伊斯兰教视为西方文明的主要威胁，同时又为同性恋权利等群体辩护（因为据说穆斯林非常讨厌它们 ） 。	Northern European demagogues, like Geert Wilders, see Islam as the main threat to Western civilization, but defend such causes as gay rights (because Muslims supposedly hate them).
例如，在什么情况下，为了保护隐私权而减少新闻自由是正确的呢？ 或者在什么情况下，为了保护新闻自由而减少对隐私的保护是正确的呢？	Under what circumstances, for example, is it right to curtail press freedom in order to protect the right to privacy, or vice versa?
欧盟一体化的深化进程给欧洲大陆带来了动力；尽管欧洲当前遇到了一些困难，但它仍具有引以为豪的实力和国际影响力。	The progressive deepening of EU integration has brought dynamic vigor to the European continent; despite Europe’s current difficulties, it still boasts extraordinary overall strength and international influence.
如果支付公平合理的一次性补偿，那么绝大多数公务员就都可以接受，公众舆论也会对拒绝接受的贪婪或懒惰之辈表示不满。	If a fair one-time payment is offered, it is likely to be taken up by a majority of civil servants, and public opinion will frown upon the greedy or lazy ones who turn it down.
应该考虑全球税收 — — 公司所得、离岸账户、国际金融交易、亿万富翁净财富、污染等 — — 来为承受压力的联动世界买单。	The time has come to think about new global taxes – on corporate incomes, offshore accounts, international financial transactions, billionaires’ net wealth, and pollution – to pay for an interconnected world under stress.
以色列和巴勒斯坦之间的冲突，是这一重要地缘政治区域的停滞不前的一个突出例子，因为这种冲突似乎完全不受任何国际形势动荡的影响。	The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians stands out as an example of the static nature of this key geopolitical region, because it seems to be completely unaffected by any international upheaval.
公共部门也可以促进这些项目采用开放的平台和标准，从而推动其在全球城市的应用（巴塞罗那的“城市协议”计划在这方面迈出了重要的一步 ） 。	The public sector can also promote the use of open platforms and standards in such projects, which would speed up adoption in cities worldwide (Barcelona’s “city protocol” initiative is a step in this direction).
也许当局将能够在 2016 年控制住局面；但更有可能的是人民币将继续其震荡之路 — — 也让全球市场随之上下翻飞。	Maybe the authorities will be able to hold on in 2016; but it is more likely that the renminbi will continue its rocky ride – taking global markets along with it.
某些人认为现在讨论替换性的货币框架为时尚早。 与此相反，中国有很好的理由现在就为向独立的货币政策过渡建立机制性基础。	Contrary to those who regard the discussion of an alternative monetary framework as premature, there are good reasons for China to begin right now to build the institutional foundation for the transition to an independent monetary policy.
在我看来，欧元必须下跌这一观点有一个非常充分的理由，而欧元应该维持稳定甚至升值有六个不那么令人信服的理由。	I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall, and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate.
不幸的是，叙利亚的温和逊尼派腹背受敌：巴沙尔政府和极端的瓦哈比派（伊斯兰教中最偏狭的思想流派 ） 。	Unfortunately, Syria’s moderate Sunnis came under attack from two sides: Assad’s government and extremist adherents of Wahhabism, Islam’s most intolerant school of thought.
诚然，巴西仍旧是一个“硬”左派国家。 譬如，卢拉党内的一些人还支持古巴的卡斯特罗兄弟和委内瑞拉总统乌戈 查韦斯。	True, Brazil still has a “hard” left, and some in Lula’s own party are comfortable with, say, Cuba’s Castro brothers and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.
而如果欧洲各国的财政部长面对汇率上的僵局感到沮丧，而一致产生独创性地管理他们的预算以刺激短期需求而不是长期增长，那将是更加糟糕的结果。	It would be even worse if European ministers, frustrated with gridlock over exchange rates, started sharing ideas for creatively managing their budgets to stimulate short-term demand, rather than long-term growth.
但是印度知道，这样做的附带损害会很大，平民生命代价令人难以接受，而且冲突失去控制的风险过大，因此无法考虑这一选择。	India understands, though, that the collateral damage would be too high, the price in civilian lives unacceptable, and the risks of the conflict spiraling out of control too acute to contemplate such an option.
此外，可持续农业重写了小型家庭农庄的价值，而在布基纳法索等国家，有近一半的国内粮食供给来自小型家庭农庄。	Moreover, sustainable practices reassert the value of small, family-run holdings, which, in countries like Burkina Faso, produce nearly all of the domestic food supply.
包括金融服务在内的自由贸易协议将最大限度地减少脱欧对各方的伤害，因为欧洲企业仍然得依赖伦敦作为该地区唯一的全球金融中心。	A free-trade agreement that includes financial services will minimize the damage from Brexit for all parties involved, because European firms will still rely on London as the region’s only global financial center.
在奥巴马成为美国总统前，他指出，美国在阿富汗没有足够的地面部队，因此而“空袭村庄和杀害平民，这给当地造成了极大的问题 。 ”	Before Barack Obama became President, he argued that, because the US did not have enough troops on the ground in Afghanistan, it was “air-raiding villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous problems there.”
为此我们应该牢记马克·吐温对自家猫的记述：在不小心坐在了热炉子上之后，它永远不会干同样的事，但同时也对一个冷的炉子敬而远之。	But we should recall Mark Twain’s story about his cat. After sitting on a hot stove, it would never sit on a hot stove again, but neither would it sit on a cold one.
库雷西还指责印度2014年袭击了白沙瓦一所军事院校，那次袭击的责任人已经被确认为巴基斯坦国内向政府发动战争的恐怖组织巴基斯坦塔利班。	Qureshi also blames India for a 2014 attack on an army school in Peshawar that has been credibly attributed to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, a home-grown terrorist group waging war on the Pakistani government.
当然他也必须与伊朗讨价还价，确保伊朗人能信守承诺，并作为一个无核武器国家继续留在《核不扩散条约》之内。	And, of course, he will need to pursue the negotiations with Iran to persuade them to keep their word and remain in the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state.
不过仍然可能通过抛售空置住房来抵消一部分建设成本，也可以把这些轧钢机械便宜卖给其他国家，或作为废品处理掉。	It still may be possible to sell off vacant apartments for a fraction of their construction cost. It may be possible to sell off rolling mill machinery to other countries, or as scrap.
而中国之所以不断对其战略资产进行现代化改造，目的就是通过提升其核力量的生存能力来提升其遏制性威慑的可靠性。	The purpose behind China’s continuous modernization of its strategic assets is to enhance the credibility of its deterrent threat by improving the survivability of its nuclear forces.
类似地，特朗普贸易战的首要目标 — — 中国，已经同意俄罗斯提出的报复美国在日本和韩国部署弹道导弹防御系统的计划。	Likewise, China, the primary target of Trump’s trade war, has now agreed to a Russian plan to retaliate against the announced deployment of US missile-defense systems in Japan and South Korea.
中国2004年全国人民代表大会将个体户、私营企业主重新定义为“社会主义事业建设者 ” ， 并把他们包括进爱国统一战线。	In China, the National People’s Congress in 2004 re-defined entrepreneurs and individual proprietors as “builders of the socialist cause,” and included them in the Patriotic United Front.
由于来自化石燃料温室气体的排放，当今大气中的二氧化碳含量比100万年前多了1/3，而冰川的崩坍则印证了这一点。	Owing to fossil-fuel emissions, there is now one-third more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than at any time in at least a million years, as the latest ice drilling in Antarctica has revealed.
而美国评论员 — — 以及越来越多的法官 — — 都想把企业的首席执行官和董事会与其公司的交易股东进一步隔离开来。	American commentators – and, increasingly, US judges – want to insulate CEOs and boards further from their firms’ trading shareholders.
首先，它正逐渐成为一个关注国家债务，尤其是其期限结构的机构，致力于保证该债务市场继续运营顺利，不出现崩溃和恐慌事件。	In the first place, it is becoming an institution concerned with state debt, particularly with its term structure, and with ensuring that the market for that debt continues to operate smoothly, without episodes of breakdown and panic.
葛兰的追随者 — — 声称支持AKP追求的自由民主和容忍、现代的伊斯兰教 — — 似乎是埃尔多安政府的天然盟友。	Gülen followers – who claimed to support liberal democracy and the tolerant, modern form of Islam embraced by the AKP – seemed like natural allies of Erdoğan’s government.
它不能被称为“原教旨主义 ” ， 因为 印度教是一种罕见的没有原教旨的宗教：它没有单一的圣经，没有单一的神，甚至没有“安息日 ” 。	It cannot be described as “fundamentalism,” for Hinduism is a religion singularly devoid of fundamentals: it lacks a single sacred book, a single version of divinity, and even the equivalent of a Sabbath day.
虽然拥有占全世界5%的人口以及极大份额的石油和天然气资源，但阿拉伯世界却总是落后于世界其他地区，并品尝着所谓“教育贫困”所结下的苦果。	With 5% of the world’s population and the bulk of the world’s oil and gas, the Arab world nonetheless lags behind most of the rest of the world, and suffers from what can best be termed “educational poverty.”
发自牛津 — — 联合国正在甄选下一任秘书长，世界银行行长的职位正虚位以待，而世界卫生组织也在物色一位新带头人，其他一些国际组织也面临着类似的状况。	OXFORD – The United Nations is seeking a new secretary-general. The World Bank presidency is up for grabs.
我们有的人并不是后犹太复国主义者，而是自由派复国主义者。 我们甚至并不对我们的社会进入这一自我审视和自我批评的方式感到骄傲。	Those of us who were not post-Zionists, but liberal Zionists, were even proud of the way our society had entered this phase of self-inspection and self-critique.
参议员林赛·格雷厄姆（Lindsey Graham）更进一步，建议现在就对朝鲜进行打击 — — 在朝鲜政权开发出将核武器送往美国所需要的导弹之前。	Senator Lindsey Graham has gone so far as to recommend launching a strike against North Korea now – before the regime can develop the missiles needed to deliver nuclear weapons to the US.
随着中国，印度和其他新兴国家的快速崛起，他们在IMF的作用也应该得到加强，应该在2011年的计划中应该得以体现。	The rapid growth of China, India, and other emerging countries should come with increased influence, to be implemented through the planned quota increase in 2011.
美国正威迫欧洲各国采取更多的财政刺激手段，而欧洲政府则对美国进行施压，让美国在全球更大范围以更大力度对金融规范进行调整。	The US is hectoring Europe for more fiscal stimulus, while the Europeans pressure the US for greater and more globally coordinated financial regulation.
但是漠视从而导致鼓励普京在国际舞台上推行他违法的方式就变成了姑息迁就，就像他正在推行的试图扼杀格鲁吉亚经济的运动。	But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia’s economy.
如果两国的经济继续以它们现在的速度增长，中国将在30年后超过美国，然而即便到那时美国的人均国民收入也会是中国的四倍。	If both countries’ economies continue to grow at their current rates, China’s could be larger than America’s in 30 years, but US per capita income will still be four times greater.
巴黎—说来也巧，美国国会有可能在9月11日左右决定是否支持奥巴马就叙利亚政府对平民使用毒气采取军事行动的方案。	PARIS – By chance, it appears that the US Congress will decide on or around September 11 whether to endorse President Barack Obama’s proposal to respond militarily to the Syrian government’s use of poison gas against civilians.
对于中国经济突出的坚韧性，一个常规的解释是它拥有巨大的国内储蓄池和外汇储备（超过3万亿美元 ） ， 可以用来消除金融恐慌。	A common explanation for China’s apparent invulnerability is that it has large pools of domestic savings and enormous foreign-exchange reserves (over $3 trillion), which can be spent down to head off financial panics.
美国政治界 — — 不仅是共和党，也包括民主党（尽管程度稍浅 ） — —总是对不吉利的现实视而不见。	The American political world – not only Republicans, but also Democrats (albeit to a lesser extent) – had fenced out huge, ominous realities.
但欧元债券是解决欧元危机根源 — — 加入欧元让成员国政府债券暴露在违约风险之下 — — 的显而易见的方案。	Yet they are the obvious solution to the root cause of the euro crisis, which is that joining the euro exposed member countries’ government bonds to the risk of default.
在伊拉克，遭遇这一命运的是多是拉美裔美国人，对他们来说，融入美国社会 — — 对其中很多人来说，这包括永久定居权或入籍承诺 — — 的重要性至少不亚于推翻萨达姆·侯赛因。	In Iraq, their equivalents were very often Latinos for whom integration into American society – including, for many, the promise of permanent residence or citizenship – was at least as important as toppling Saddam Hussein.
这也是为何过去几个月的讨论大多 — — 如果没有异议的话 — — 集中在如何支持意西两国的调整和改革之上。	That is why discussions over the last few months have largely, if implicitly, been about how to support adjustment and reform in Italy and Spain.
男性倾向于冒险（特别是年轻的时候 ） ， 这或许有生物学方面的原因，但社会规范通过将冒险和阳刚之气相联系助长了高风险和不健康的行为。	While there may be a biological component to men’s propensity for risk taking (especially among young men), gender norms reinforce risky or unhealthy behaviors by associating them with masculinity.
在执行共同政策方针方面的重点权力已经委托给欧盟委员会，而欧盟理事会则将自身权力限定为在获得符合条件的多数成员支持的情况下否决委员会的提议。	Key powers over the implementation of common policy guidelines have been entrusted to the European Commission, and the European Council has limited its own ability to reject Commission recommendations by requiring a qualified majority to change them.
在“坏帐银行”模式中，政府管理其收购的所有不良资产又带来新的问题，因为政府没有专长经验来完成这一任务。	In the “bad bank” model, the government has the additional problem of managing all the bad assets that it purchased – a task for which it lacks expertise.
为解决这个问题，密克罗尼西亚联邦计划今后五年内在所属水域的每条延绳钓船上安装远程传感器、GPS定位系统、摄像及跟踪设备。	To remedy this, FSM plans to deploy remote sensors, GPS systems, cameras, and tracking devices on every longline vessel in its waters within five years.
持续增长需要制定相应的发展策略作为支撑，但大多数发展中国家且尚未制定一个类似的策略，因此也无法确保他们能进一步缩短与发达国家之间的经济差距。	Sustained growth requires a growth strategy, and most developing countries do not yet have one that would put them irrevocably on the path of economic convergence.
欧盟机构是否足够强大，能够面对这些挑战？ 我们是否必须重新考虑 — — 有可能还要重建 — — 欧洲合作的支柱？	Are European institutions strong enough to confront that challenge, or must we reconsider – and potentially recast – the pillars of European cooperation?
反之，面临增长缓慢问题的美国则乐于维持极高的消费水平，但这样的代价是个人储蓄下降、房地产泡沫越吹越大，并在破灭后留下了满目疮痍。	By contrast, the US, in the face of slow growth, was content to sustain exceptionally high levels of consumption at the expense of personal savings, inflating a massive housing bubble that burst with a very large and deeply disturbing bang.
看似无可辩驳的理论模型支撑着一个范式，这个范式已经发生了重大变化，如果维持下去，注定会导致严重的政治问题。	Seemingly irrefutable theoretical models underlie a paradigm that has changed in significant ways, and that, if preserved, is bound to cause serious political problems.
这一分歧在经济和社会政策上尤其尖锐，但也扩展到了其他领域，如教育政策（比如延长教育还是早早地分流 ） 。	This division remains particularly acute in economic and social policy, though it also extends to other areas, like education policy (for example, extended education versus early specialization).
我们显然需要采取更着眼点更宏大的外交手段并从位处这一问题核心的根本点入手：即各方还未签署一项和平条约来结束1950~53年的朝鲜战争。	Clearly, a broader diplomatic approach is needed, and it should start by addressing a fundamental issue at the heart of the problem: namely, that no peace treaty has ever been signed to end the 1950-1953 Korean War.
正统量化宽松 — — 让我们称之为“货币化一号 ” — —是有逆���操作的打算的，用税收筹集资金回购央行所持有的政府债券。	Orthodox QE – let’s call it “monetization one” – is intended to be reversed, with taxation used to raise the money to redeem the government bonds held by the central bank.
这些学术会议有助于激发对耐药性的伦理问题的学术兴趣，但远远不足以帮助世界安全度过近在眼前的道德雷区。	These scholarly gatherings have helped to foster academic interest in the ethical considerations of drug resistance, but represent only a tiny fraction of what is needed to help the world safely navigate the looming moral minefield.
2007至2016年间，标准普尔500指数中的19家制药公司（截至2017年1月）花了2,970亿美元用于回购股份和提振股价，从而提升高管股票期权的价值。	Between 2007 and 2016, the 19 pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 as of January 2017 spent $297 billion repurchasing their own shares to boost their stock price, and thus the value of their executives’ stock options.
此外，尽管研究者尚未发现支持任何一种理论的结果，但他们通过更好地定义任何引力的量子理论都必须考虑的观察标准推动的科学进步。	And, though researchers may not have found results supporting any one theory, they have advanced the cause of science by better defining the observational criteria any quantum theory of gravity will have to take into account.
尽管长期停滞在2008年金融危机发生五年后成了一种模因（meme ） ， 但这个术语本身的历史要悠久得多。	Although secular stagnation became a meme five years after the 2008 financial crisis, the term itself is much older.
它们可以出口喷气机发动机，超级计算机，飞机以及所有种类的计算机芯片，唯独没有它们做得来而且实际生产产品，如纺织品、农产品或者加工食品。	They can export jet engines, supercomputers, airplanes, computer chips of all kinds—just not textiles, agricultural products, or processed foods, the goods they can and do produce.
年初，当布什要求削减开支 — — 包括一项包含将来减少福利的社会保障改革 — — 的时候，世界上的投资者们就料到布什会得逞，至少在很大程度上如此。	When Bush asked for spending cuts at the beginning of the year – including a social security reform that includes cuts in future benefits – world financiers expected that Bush would get his way, or most of it.
美国是唯一一个同时参与两大谈判的国家，它面临着一个选择：要么推动两大谈判齐头并进，要么牺牲其中一个谈判成就另一个。	As the only party to both initiatives, the US is well placed either to move them forward in harmony or to leverage the progress of one negotiation against the other.
相反，区域和全球资本加大对教育、医疗、可再生能源、农业和基础设施的投资才是为中东和世界建设更稳定未来的真正关键所在。	By contrast, a surge of investment in education, health, renewable energy, agriculture, and infrastructure, financed both from within the region and globally, is the real key to building a more stable future for the Middle East and the world.
这还能带来工作时间的减少，最终实现马克思的梦想 — — 一个技术进步让个体能够“在早上打猎，在下午钓鱼，在黄昏喂养家畜、在晚饭后指点江山 ” 。	It would also allow working hours to be reduced – finally approaching Marx’s dream of a society in which technological progress enables individuals to “hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner.”
1919年，经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）描绘了住在伦敦的英国人用电话从世界各地定购商品，然后就在家里坐等下午接收。	In 1919, the economist John Maynard Keynes described the possibility of an Englishman in London using a telephone to order goods from around the world to be delivered to his house by the afternoon.
而且因为就连社会党派也卖力地推动自由经济政策，那么有着民族主义和保护主义背景的极右势力借社会问题渔利也就毫不奇怪了。	And, since even socialist parties pushed liberal economic policies, it is not surprising that the far right, with its nationalist and protectionist overtones, has hijacked the social question.
该国政府在经济景气的时候并没有预留资源，因此它现在就缺少像其他国家政府那样实施积极的公共开支刺激计划所必需的财政空间。	The government did not set aside resources while things were going well, and now it does not have the fiscal space needed for an aggressive boost to public spending of the type that many other governments are attempting.
与全世界的左翼一样，法国左翼也支持高程度的国家控制经济以及以技术官僚而不是自由主义解决方案对付社会和经济问题。	Like leftists everywhere, the French left favors a large degree of state control of the economy, together with technocratic rather than liberal solutions to social and economic problems.
而更重要的是通胀预期已经开始动摇。 经济预测专家和投资者们都预期这种无法达到目标的状况将一直维持到中期。	Even more important, inflation expectations have started to de-anchor: forecasters and investors expect the undershooting of the target to persist over the medium term.
最初认为是一个国家（意大利）的问题，像多米诺骨牌一般推倒了其他国家的汇率：英国、西班牙、葡萄牙，到了1993年7月，连法国都摇摇欲坠。	What was initially seen as a problem in one country (Italy) toppled other currency regimes like dominos: Britain, Spain, and Portugal – and, by July 1993, even France was vulnerable.
而加拿大 — — 其金融体系由五家大银行主宰 — — 比几乎其他所有国家都更轻松地度过了2008—2009年全球金融危机。	Yet Canada, with a financial system dominated by just five large banks, sailed through the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 more easily than almost any other country.
尽管对这两大因素谁更重要还存在争议 — — 诚然，要作出比较十分困难 — — 但可以确定地说，这两大因素都起到了促进美国复苏的作用。	Though analysts differ on the relative importance of these two factors – and, indeed, it is difficult to weight them – it is safe to say that both played a role in facilitating the US recovery.
在英国，利率上限直到1835年才被取消；2009年以来央行普遍采取了近零利率则是保护债务人的最新例子。	Interest-rate caps were abolished in Britain only in 1835; the near-zero central-bank rates prevailing since 2009 are a current example of efforts to protect borrowers.
这将使让巴基斯坦迈出扎实的政治步子，胜过其他目前也处于类似局面（即建立更具可问责性的治理）但进展甚少的穆斯林大国。	This would put Pakistan on sounder political footing than several other large Muslim countries, which are currently engaged in similar – but far less successful – efforts to institute more accountable governance.
令问题更加棘手的是，特朗普治下的美国似乎无法继续遏制俄罗斯或支持其一手创造的1945年后的自由世界秩序。	Compounding the problem, it seems that the United States under President Donald Trump cannot be counted on to continue constraining Russia or underwriting the post-1945 liberal world order that it created.
提议中的防御公约本来还要通过一个欧洲政治共同体计划来加强。 该共同体的主要特点将会通过一个由各国议会组成的宪法委员会来明确。	The proposed defense treaty was also to be buttressed by plans for a European political community whose main features were to be defined by a constitutional commission made up of members of national parliaments.
与此同时，金融市场正在迫使各国政府采取财政整顿措施，计划中的新财政条约（为德国和其他一些国家所坚持）亦然。	At the same time, financial markets are forcing fiscal retrenchment on governments, as will the planned new fiscal treaty (on which Germany, among others, insisted).
虽然马哈蒂尔在北京发出的反对“新版殖民主义”警告因大胆而引人注目，但它们反映了对中国这种重商主义贸易，投资和贷款行为的一种更广泛抵制。	While Mahathir’s warnings in Beijing against “a new version of colonialism” stood out for their boldness, they reflect a broader pushback against China’s mercantilist trade, investment, and lending practices.
此外，MBS成功收服了所有这些部门，同时仍然能够在形式上遵守沙特王室严格的家规和错综复杂的层级制度。	Moreover, MBS managed all of this while still formally adhering to the Saudi royal family’s strict protocols and elaborate codes of hierarchy.
即便国际核聚变实验堆能获得成功，人们解决了氚和材料的问题，所有的东西也还需要进行实际规模的测试，只有到那时才能开始建造工业级反应堆的第一个样板。	Even if ITER is successful, and if one solves the tritium and material problems, everything would need to be tested in real size, and only then could a first prototype of an industrial reactor be built.
尽管身体内的所有细胞的NDA都是相同的，但是不同的细胞类型只含有带有DNA密码的某个基因子集，这样就产生了皮肤细胞、肝细胞和脑细胞之间的区别。	Though all cells in the body have the same DNA, only a subset of the genes encoded by the DNA is expressed in each cell type, thus accounting for the difference between, say, a skin cell, a liver cell, and a brain cell.
直接比较不同种类的能源发电难度很大，因为一天内的不同时间风能、太阳能、核能和化石燃料的使用并不一致。	Direct comparisons of different power sources are difficult, because the use of wind, solar, nuclear, and fossil-fuel plants varies according to the time of day.
结果，一些共和党著名政客敦促该党反思其反移民政策，而奥巴马也计划在第二个任期伊始便将移民改革列入日程。	As a result, several prominent Republican politicians are now urging their party to reconsider its anti-immigration policies, and plans for immigration reform will be on the agenda at the beginning of Obama’s second term.
因此，我们看到了共和党候选人泰德·科鲁兹（Ted Cruz ） 、 兰德·保罗（Rand Paul）和麦克·哈卡比（Mike Huckabee）要求美联储固定黄金美元价格的方案。	Thus, we have proposals by Republican candidates Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Huckabee to require the Fed to maintain a fixed dollar price of gold.
对已有子女、抵押贷款和其他财务责任的中年劳动者来说，必须接受以周或月、而非年计的培训，同时接受上述培训的资金支持也是不可或缺的。	For mid-career workers with children, mortgages, and other financial responsibilities, training that is measured in weeks and months, not in years, will be necessary, as will financial support to undertake such training.
第二年秋天，也就是2000年，下一批学生也选择了《哈利波特与魔法石》作为期末分析著作，就像之前的同龄人一样，他们自信地拒绝接受这部著作。	The following autumn, in 2000, the next cohort of students also picked Sorcerer’s Stone for the final text, and, like their peers, they confidently dismissed it.
因此，他的方案与联合国政府间气候变化专门委员会和联合国环境规划署（UNEP）提出的方案类似，两者都认为全球变暖超过一定限度将会带来真正的灾难。	As such, his approach is also similar to that of the IPCC and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), both of which have concluded that global warming above a certain level will have truly disastrous effects.
另一个要求是它们的团队必须具备更加专业的投资技能，与其他国内投资者紧密协作，以使收购对各自国家经济产生乘数效应。	It also requires that they equip their teams with more investment expertise and coordinate closely with other domestic investors so that their acquisitions can have a multiplier effect on their respective national economies.
美联储前主席本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke）指出，要是中国等国家支出更多，那么几乎让美国破产的泡沫一开始就不会形成。	As former US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke put it, if only countries like China had spent more, the bubbles that nearly broke America would not have formed in the first place.
许多非洲国家也表现出一个广泛的模式，包括良好的宏观经济规则，持久的加速增长，经济多样化以及高昂的投资者信心。	Many African countries, too, are showing a broad pattern of sound macroeconomic fundamentals, durable growth acceleration, economic diversification, and investor confidence.
最大的金砖经济体中国也陷入了结构性减速，其经济增长率在未来两年中将向5%靠拢（目前为7%以上 ） 。	The biggest, China, is in the midst of a structural slowdown that will push its growth rate closer to 5% in the next two years, from above 7% now.
部分原因也许在于，对主要新闻组织而言，这些评估通常是根据安全顾问的意见进行的 — — 这些安全顾问往往是男性退伍军人，未必能充分理解女性所面临的特殊风险。	This may be partly because, for major news organizations, these assessments are often handled in consultation with safety advisers – usually former military men, who may not fully appreciate the particular risks women face.
不仅如此，梅休并没有发现表明衍生品市场在基础现金市场中造成波动的证据，而事实情况却恰恰相反，衍生品市场能够对基础现金市场的波动起到缓解作用。	Moreover, he found that there is no evidence that derivative markets create volatility in underlying cash markets; in fact, they may even reduce it.
SPD根据形势反弹，采取骑墙态度，并最终让步，因为默克尔手握有力的规训工具：她可以要求举行新选举，CDU可能获得全面胜利。	The SPD will recoil at the prospect, sit on the fence, and finally give in, because Merkel has a powerful disciplinary instrument: she could call a new election, in which the CDU would probably win an outright majority.
在没有直接承认美国在引发金融危机中的主要作用的情况下，美国联邦储备系统已经分别为韩国、巴西、墨西哥和新加坡的中央银行提供了高达300亿美元的货币互换。	Without directly acknowledging America’s central role in causing the financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve has already offered to exchange up to $30 billion each with the central banks of Korea, Brazil, Mexico and Singapore.
1968年法国出现的大规模抗议活动导致提前举行议会选举，而戴高乐的支持者在议会选举中赢得了决定性的胜利。	The massive protests in France in 1968 led to an early parliamentary election, which de Gaulle’s supporters won decisively.
由于美国政府的大部分债务都在外国投资者手里，这个预测意味着他们将在未来十年内吸收超过6万亿美元的美国债券。	Because foreign investors hold the majority of US government debt, this projection implies that they will absorb more than $6 trillion in US bonds during the next ten years.
此外，欧盟已向挪威和瑞士等非成员国明确表示，要想进入欧盟单一市场，唯有接受其大部分规则，包括人员自由流动和为欧盟预算出资。	Moreover, the EU has made clear to non-members such as Norway and Switzerland that they can have full access to the single market only if they accept most of its rules, including the free movement of people, and contribute to the EU budget.
而现在，因为确认巨额援助资金被盗，这种悲伤的情绪又掺杂了愤怒和失望 — — 这样的不满既针对欺诈行为本身，也针对这件事所体现出来的非洲改善医疗机会和成果的斗争现状。	And now, with confirmation that huge sums of aid were stolen, the grief is compounded by anger and disappointment – at the fraud itself, but also for what it says about Africa’s struggles to improve health-care access and outcomes.
过去十年来，该地区内部贸易流出现了爆发式增长，但其主要模式是零件和半成品输入中国，再由中国组装后出口发达国家。	Intra-regional trade flows have surged during the last decade, but they have been concentrated in parts and components that go into finished products assembled in China for export to developed countries.
按照创始人杰弗里·萨克斯的说法，雄心勃勃的千禧村概念本应在多方面同时取得进展 ， “ 用三年或者更少的时间创造出重大的成果 ” 。	The ambitious Millennium Villages concept was supposed to create simultaneous progress on multiple fronts, producing “major results in three or fewer years,” according to founder Jeffrey D. Sachs.
在完全独裁的制度下，公共知识分子、自由派政党和公民社会机构都被镇压；而在不自由民主中，它们只是受到干扰，但大多仍然存在。	Under outright autocracy, public intellectuals, liberal parties, and the institutions of civil society are crushed; under illiberal democracy, they are harassed, but mostly survive.
正如人类基因编辑国际峰会最近所指出的那样，在达成广泛的社会共识前就继续进行对生殖细胞编辑的临床应用是不负责任的行为。	As the International Summit on Human Gene Editing recently stated, it would be irresponsible to proceed with a clinical use of germline editing without broad societal agreement.
比如，在大部分欧洲各国家，大约每1,000名病人有30名医生为他们服务；在尼日利亚，这一比例为4:100,000。	For example, in most European countries, there are roughly 30 doctors for every 1,000 patients; in Nigeria, that ratio is closer to 4:100,000.
但奥巴马也同时意识到，如果现有的核武国家希望其他国家接受更严格的管制，他们就必须削减自己的核武器数量。	But Obama also knows that if the existing nuclear states want others to accept tougher restrictions, they will have to cut back their nuclear arsenals.
冷战结束迄今已将近25年，我们依旧摆脱不了冷战时期的遗留战略：核武器继续支撑着世界最强国的国际安全政策。	Nearly 25 years after the Cold War’s end, we remain stuck with its strategic legacy: Nuclear weapons continue to underpin the international security policy of the world’s most powerful states.
直到2014年，欧盟在2004年所进行的“大爆炸”式扩张可谓成功，在中欧和东欧的经济和政治平稳快速转型中起到了重要作用。	By 2014, the EU’s “big bang” enlargement in 2004 could be hailed as a success story, having contributed significantly to swift and peaceful economic and political transition in Central and Eastern Europe.
但不论是2008年金融危机，还是随后的欧元危机（因公共债务过多引起 ） ， 都没有导致受影响国家出现大规模去杠杆化或熊彼特式创造性破坏。	But neither the 2008 crisis nor the subsequent euro crisis, which was caused by excessive public debt, led to significant deleveraging or Schumpeterian creative destruction in the affected countries.
有时这一风险包括众所周知的政府与企业之间的“旋转门 ” ， 即私人部门高级岗位与高级官员岗位之间的人事互换。	Sometimes the risk entails the proverbial “revolving door” between government and business, through which personnel glide from senior private-sector jobs to top official posts and back again.
欧元区最终教会了IMF什么？ 是公共和私人债务的积累有害于增长、与过去相比，它应该极大地提高对债务减记和重组的强调吗？	Has the eurozone crisis finally taught the IMF that public and private debt overhangs are significant impediments to growth, and that it should place much greater emphasis on debt write-downs and restructuring than it has in the past?
几乎是在同时，登盛还给出了一个更加强烈的信号，表明这一届政府是一个完全不同的政府：他释放了一批政治犯，并邀请昂山素季和他展开直接对话。	Almost simultaneously, Thein Sein offered even stronger signals that his was a very different Burmese administration: he freed political prisoners and invited Suu Kyi for direct talks with him.
更为重要的是，中国呼吁引入全新储备货币是因其懊恼于美国和欧洲等主要国家政府无力在管理自己的经济事务时表现出现实的态度和良好的判断力。	Most importantly, China’s call for the introduction of a new reserve currency stems from its frustration with the failure of major governments – whether in the US or Europe – to govern their economic affairs with realism and good sense.
与韩国的扶贫经验相似，非洲千禧村及其他类似计划正在大幅提升粮食产量、改善儿童健康状况，并打造一条可持续的脱贫之路。	Like South Korea’s own experience in fighting poverty, Millennium Villages in Africa, and similar projects elsewhere, are now surging ahead in food production, children’s health, and in forging a sustainable pathway out of poverty itself.
就像烟草文件将烟草业赶出决策过程一样，埃克森调查应促使世界领导人将化石燃料行业清除出解决气候危机的进程。	Just as the tobacco files drove the tobacco industry out of policymaking processes, the Exxon investigation should compel world leaders to eliminate the fossil-fuel industry from efforts to solve the climate crisis.
反过来，很多伊朗人把奥巴马视为力争颠覆伊朗政权的美国温和派，而将其前任乔治·W·布什视为美国最诚实、也最激进的代表人物。	Many Iranians, in turn, regard Obama as the friendly face of a US that still seeks regime change in their country, whereas his predecessor, George W. Bush, was America’s more honest – because more radical – representative.
而限制州所得税和房产税的减免额度几乎肯定会压低对教育和基础设施的投资 — — 这也不是一个提高美国国家竞争力的合理策略。	And limiting the deductibility of state income tax and property tax will almost surely reduce investment in education and infrastructure – again, not a sound strategy for increasing American competitiveness.
我们需要最终并完全地批准《里斯本条约 》 ， 以打造一个我们所需要的在制度上和国际上都更强大的欧洲。	We need final and complete ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in order to have the institutionally and internationally stronger European Union we need.
人们普遍认为是谋杀命令是由沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（Mohammed bin Salman）下达的。	Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is widely believed to have ordered the killing.
巴基斯坦是否被沿着伊斯兰极端主义和紧急状态管治的道路上拖下去，还是最终实现现代化，成为民官领导下的世俗国家？	Will Pakistan be dragged along the path of Islamic extremism and emergency rule, or finally achieve modernity as a secular nation under civilian leadership?
中国千年以来一直是世界最大的国家，19世纪中叶以前也一直是最大的经济体，主要原因是有众多的生产者和客户。	China has been the world’s largest country for millennia, and until the mid-nineteenth century it was the largest economy, too – mainly because it had so many consumers and producers.
但台湾人并不那么笃定 — — 他们看着现在的香港正在发生什么。 1997年回归中国前，香港也得到了同样的承诺。	But the Taiwanese cannot be very reassured by what they see happening today in Hong Kong, which was promised the same thing before its return to China in 1997.
还有不那么宽容的解释，那就是现代援助史中的富国议会吝啬到不愿为贫困国家直接提供赠款，而只有得到还钱的许诺后才可能同意帮忙。	A not-so-generous interpretation of modern aid history is that rich countries’ legislatures were too cheap to give outright grants to the poorest countries, and could be persuaded to help out only if they were told that the money would be repaid.
中国在非洲经济中所发挥的作用也曾受到批评；但正如我之前所说的那样，中国投资一直维系着非洲大陆许多人的生命。	China’s role in African economies has been criticized; but, as I have argued before, Chinese investment has also been a lifeline to many on the continent.
此外，在1929~1932年股市出现有史以来最大跌幅之前的市场高点时期，12个月的实际收益增长率为18.3 ％ 。	Moreover, at the market peak just before the biggest ever stock-market drop, in 1929-32, 12-month real earnings growth stood at 18.3%.
首先，这将产生一个拥有庞大市场职能的国家资产负债表，提振就业，刺激创新，并推进整个经济体的结构转型。	First and foremost, it would reconcile a large state balance sheet with an expanding role for markets, bolstering employment, stimulating innovation, and advancing the economy’s structural transformation.
第二，他坚信市场和自由贸易的力量，而这两者在过去本个世纪中在减轻贫困上发挥的作用明显要比任何援助项目都大。	Second, he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade, which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half-century than any aid program.
发自马尼拉 — — 1980年，我父亲在独裁者费迪南德·马科斯的牢狱迫害之下心脏病发，前往美国接受搭桥手术。	MANILA – In 1980, my father arrived in the United States to undergo a heart bypass, due to the rigors of his imprisonment by the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.
不难想象可能出现拒绝握手或拿出一张账单这样的情景，一如特朗普据报道对德国总理默克尔做的那样（白宫否认了这则报道 ） 。	It wasn’t hard to imagine a refused handshake or the presentation of a bill for payment, like the one Trump reportedly gave visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel (a report denied by the White House).
只有日本，1971年8月战役的首要目标，遭受了沉重打击。 这被日本人称作第二次“尼克松休克 ” ， 第一次是几个月之前，尼克松突然宣布将于1972年访问中国大陆。	Only the most obvious of the targets of August 1971, Japan, was badly hit by what the Japanese called the second “Nixon shokku” (the first being Nixon’s announcement the previous month that he would visit mainland China in 1972).
但是，也许重要的还要数朝鲜独裁统治的支柱之一目前已经开始崩塌 — — 而与此同时，该国极有可能将再次面临人为的严重食物短缺。	But, perhaps most important, one of the pillars of the North Korean dictatorship may now be cracking – at a time when the country must once again cope with a severe, man-made food shortage.
毕竟，以两国制方案为基础且剥夺1948年后难民“回归权”的巴勒斯坦人真正的和平努力将激怒哈马斯并重燃派系暴力，从而在众多的失败中再加上一个砝码。	After all, genuine peace efforts by the Palestinians – based on a two-state solution with no “right of return” for post-1948 refugees – would enrage Hamas and revive factional violence, adding another self-defeat to an already long list.
更有甚者，他还和俄罗斯在今年年底达成协议，将减少战略武器的续约进一步落实，并将无核化议题提交联合国和20国集团讨论。	Moreover, he followed up by negotiating with Russia a successor to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by the end of this year, and has moved the non-proliferation issue to the top of the agenda at the UN and the G-20.
今后一年 — — 特别是9月在杭州举行的G-20峰会期间 — — 中国准备为建设更加“创新、活力、联动、包容”的世界经济奠定基础。	Over the next year – and especially at the organization’s September summit, to be held in Hangzhou – China plans to help lay the groundwork for a world economy that is more “innovative, invigorated, interconnected, and inclusive.”
在花旗集团（Citigroup）则成为标准普尔500指数成分股中第一家多数股东拒绝了管理层薪资计划的公司。	At Citigroup, a majority of shareholders rejected managers’ pay at Citigroup – the first S&P 500 company at which that happened.
早在2003年，当时格里高利·曼昆出任小布什总统的首席经济顾问，他就提到过经济刺激方案，这并不是什么高深的问题。	As N. Gregory Mankiw said of a stimulus package back in 2003, when he was President George W. Bush's chief economic advisor, this is not rocket science.
如果国家转型计划想要实现更大程度的经济多元化，沙特阿拉伯有必要利用出口导向的高附加值增长，并最终实现更深层次的地区和国际融合。	If the NTP is to deliver greater economic diversification, Saudi Arabia will need to harness high value-added, export-led growth and, eventually, greater regional and international integration.
如果它们不想让增长减速，让劳动力迟迟得不到吸收，让社会不稳定风险与日俱增，那么他们就必须果断地将注意力转向该地区内部的35亿消费者。	Unless they want to settle for slower growth, lagging labor absorption, and heightened risk of social instability, they must move aggressively to shift focus to the region’s own 3.5 billion consumers.
华盛顿—两百年前，华盛顿被英国人攻陷，入城的英国人随后放火烧了包括白宫、财政部和国会在内的公共建筑。	WASHINGTON, DC – Two hundred years ago, Washington DC was captured by the British – who then proceeded to set fire to official buildings, including the White House, Treasury Department, and Congress.
作为越来越担心西方针对伊朗核设施的军事行为的反应，革命卫队首脑最近大大强硬了其针对美国和以色列的语言立场。	Reacting to mounting fear of Western military action against Iran’s nuclear facilities, Revolutionary Guard commanders recently sharpened their rhetoric against the US and Israel.
但由于英国央行认为经济已经充分发挥其潜力，所以尽管GDP增长缓慢且估计从现在到2021年（其预测期的最后一年）间仅能实现1.7~1.8％的年均增长率，它仍毅然选择加息。	But, because the BoE believes the economy is already growing at its full potential, it has raised interest rates now, even though GDP growth is slow and is estimated to only reach 1.7-1.8% between now and 2021, the end of its forecast period.
在2010年以前签署一项具有强大约束力的全球性协议将在未来几十年规划出行动路线。 这在几个月以前还不大可能，而现在很有可能得到落实。	Though unlikely just a few months ago, a strong global agreement by 2010, one that will set a path for action for decades to come, now stands a good chance of being implemented.
大多数新的一代俄罗斯妇女和男子也是如此。 在她们现代和算计的头脑中已经没有了牺牲的位置，无论牺牲是为了家庭、艺术、文化或者科学。	So do most of the new generation of Russian women (and men): in their modern, calculating minds, there is little place for sacrifice, whether for family, art, culture, or science.
虽然日本的人口下降确实带来了挑战，但这也可能意味着一些优势：同时日本的债务也远比它们表面上看更具可持续性。	While Japan’s demographic decline poses challenges, it may also imply some advantages: and Japan’s debts are far more sustainable than they appear.
在这方面，欧盟必须起到领导作用，释放出应有的强硬信号，立即承认巴勒斯坦国 — — 就像70%多的联合国成员国已经做过的那样。	Here, the EU must take the lead and send a message that is as forceful as it is necessary, by immediately recognizing – as over 70% of UN member states have already done – the State of Palestine.
初始报告收集了来自十多家欧洲政府的18份方案，主题涵盖了新海底光缆、加密、本地化数据储存、国内产业支持、国际行为准则和数据保护法律等。	An initial report identifies 18 proposals from more than a dozen European governments on subjects including new undersea cables, encryption, localized data storage, domestic industry support, international codes of conduct, and data protection laws.
同时，监管者应该根据风险的大小，区分商用和民用抵押贷款的借贷价值比例（loan-to-value ratio ） ， 划分相应的风险等级，以防止房地产泡沫的产生。	Similarly, financial authorities should vary the loan-to-value ratio on commercial and residential mortgages for risk-weighting purposes in order to forestall real estate bubbles.
然后他可能会解雇大批官员，更严厉的对待移民，并试图停止穆勒对其选举团队与克里姆林宫可能的串通以及特朗普可能的阻挠司法行为的调查行动。	He might then fire a raft of officials, treat immigrants still more harshly, and try to shut down Mueller’s investigation of his campaign’s possible collusion with the Kremlin and Trump’s probable obstruction of justice.
事实上，同政界牵扯不清是欧式家族资本主义的两大软肋之一 — — 企业主寻求政治优势和人脉的热情不亚于搞技术革新。	Indeed, political entanglements are one of two sources of weakness in European-style family capitalism, as owners seek political advantages and preferred access as much as they strive for technical innovation.
但直到领导层在2012-2013年换届之前，中国的政策制定者们都将继续在罔顾巨额未来成本的情况下维持一个高增长率。	Until the change of political leadership in 2012-2013, China’s policymakers may be able to maintain high growth rates, but at a very high foreseeable cost.
惟其如此，对人民币的压力，以及对中国外汇储备的压力才会有所减少，因为国内外投资者将能够看清楚未来情况。	Only then will the pressure on the renminbi, and on China’s foreign-exchange reserves, subside, because investors both within and outside the country will see a clear way forward.
当美国试图通过硬权力、改变政权、制裁和以先发制人的武装干涉相威胁来达到其目的时，欧洲却采用了软权力、外交、接触和伙伴关系的策略。	While the US tries to achieve this through hard power, regime change, sanctions, and threats of pre-emptive military intervention, Europe uses soft power, diplomacy, inclusion, and partnership.
安卡拉—土耳其正在加紧打击叙利亚库尔德武装的军事行动，很容易将这些暴力归咎于土耳其总统艾尔多安的高调的沙文主义和仇外主义。	ANKARA – As Turkey intensifies its military campaign against Syrian Kurdish fighters, it is tempting to blame the violence on President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s strident jingoism and xenophobia.
除了维持利率低于市场水平之外，政府还为汽车、机械以及钢铁等几个行业提供优先廉价信贷渠道，优惠税收待遇和公共投资支持。	Beyond keeping interest rates below market levels, the government offered the automobile, machinery, and steel industries, among others, preferential access to cheap credit, favorable tax treatment, and public investment support.
实际上，随着十二世纪和十三世纪欧洲大学崛起，规模更小、速度更慢、而且更为不完整的维基百科社区出现了。	Indeed, a much smaller, slower, and more fragmented version of the Wikipedia community came into existence with the rise of universities in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Europe.
在里加举行的东欧伙伴关系峰会可以而且必须证明欧洲有决心在俄罗斯侵略面前捍卫自身的统一、安全和价值观。	The EU Eastern Partnership summit in Riga can and must demonstrate Europe’s determination to defend its unity, security, and values in the face of Russian aggression.
直升机撒钱将把风险从政府资产负债表转移到央行资产负债表，模糊政策、机构和它们之间的相对自主权之间的界线。	Helicopter money would transfer risk from governments’ balance sheets to those of central banks, blurring the lines between policies, institutions, and their relative autonomy.
连通性因素 — — 如互联网、金融市场、航空枢纽或物流中心 — — 助长了全球化效应的“超级传播 ” ， 有利也有弊。	The vectors of connectivity – such as the Internet, financial markets, airport hubs, or logistics centers – facilitate “super-spreading” of globalization’s effects, both positive and negative.
这个想法听起来合乎逻辑，因为有一个可以让他安居乐业的好工作，人是不会与美国人或者他的伊拉克同胞交战的，对不对？	The idea sounds logical: a man with a good job that enables him to build a decent life won’t want to fight Americans or his fellow Iraqis, right?
新的物权法如果不能配以普通公民有更多诉求公正的途径，那么它就不会成为政府所标榜的维护权利的一个突破。	The new property law won’t be the breakthrough for rights protection that the government claims it is until it is matched by increased access to justice for ordinary citizens.
而麦利亚德公司只不过是把这个发现稍微提早了一点，却因其无情追求经济利润所的行为削弱了这两个基因的社会效益。	The social benefits of Myriad’s slightly earlier discovery have been dwarfed by the costs that its callous pursuit of profit has imposed.
特别是俞正声、张德江和张高丽，他们来自中国最强大、最有活力的三个都市中心 — — 上海、重庆和天津。	That is especially true of Yu Zhengsheng and the two Zhangs, Dejiang and Gaoli, who come from senior roles in three of China’s most powerful and dynamic urban centers – Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin.
事实上，在如何实现突破这个问题上美国人有自己的想法，尤其在是对付以色列这个奥巴马政府当前认定的头号障碍方面。	Instead, the Americans have their own ideas about how to achieve a breakthrough, especially with Israel, which the Obama administration believes is now the major obstacle.
他简单地接受了孟克关于千年村计划（Millennium Villages Project）失败的论断。	He simply accepts Munk’s assertion that the Millennium Villages Project – an ongoing development project across more than 20 African countries – has failed.
如果他们要负责公司的方方面面，那就不能在自己的巨额薪酬方案为外界所知时仅仅凭借一句“我值这么多钱”来逃避责任。	If they are responsible for all aspects of the company, then they cannot abdicate responsibility with a “Because I’m worth it” attitude when news of their large pay packages becomes public.
但它同时也也忘记了1990年代 — — 也是第一个所谓“失落的10年 ” — —再此期间当局尽其所能延长资不抵债的银行和许多非金融公司的寿命。	But it has also lost sight of the 1990’s – the first of its so-called lost decades – when the authorities did all they could to prolong the life of insolvent banks and many nonfinancial corporations.
最后，民主党人必须确保任何增加的支出或转移支付 — — 包括工资保险 — — 都能得到支付，而且不是在全面扩大预算赤字的情况下。	Finally, Democrats must ensure that any increased spending or transfers – including wage insurance – is paid for, rather than being allowed to blow the budget deficit wide open.
但海牙法庭和二次大战后纽伦堡法庭之间的对比正在日渐消失：由于审判迁延日久，观察家们怀疑为什么用了那么长时间来确立战争责任。	But comparisons to the post-WWII Nuremberg tribunal have worn thin: as the proceedings drag on, observers wonder why it has taken so long to establish criminal liability.
西方决策者并没有表现出开明的领导力，反而一直不能直面事实，他们的反应混合了否认、错误诊断和有害无利的扯皮，使人难以摸着头脑。	Rather than exhibiting enlightened leadership, Western policymakers have consistently lagged realities on the ground, with a bewildering mixture of denial, misdiagnosis, and bickering undermining their responses.
不仅仅是政府，宗教和其他组织的领导人也应该被劝说来谴责恐怖主义，是那些进行恐怖活动的人感到羞耻，并且宣布他们的非法的。	Not just governments, but religious and other leaders need to be persuaded to denounce terror, shaming and de-legitimizing those who carry it out.
即便是劳动力问题也是可以解决的，只要来自前苏联中亚地区 — — 甚至可能逐渐自由化的朝鲜 — — 的工人能够参与地区开发所需要的雄心勃勃的项目。	Even the labor problem is solvable, with millions of workers from former Soviet Central Asia – and perhaps from a gradually liberalizing North Korea – able to take part in the ambitious development that will be needed.
玻利维亚如果能以其��侧邻国巴西为榜样会取得不错的发展，巴西在20世纪80年代实现民主化后，教育和科技投资都有了长足的进步。	Bolivia would do well to follow the example of its eastern neighbor, Brazil, which has experienced a surge in educational and scientific investments since its democratization in the 1980’s.
最后，2016年通胀率又回到40 % ， 与此同时，此前用来掩盖真实通胀率的扭曲性价格补贴也被取消。	It finally jumped back up to 40% in 2016, propelled by the removal of distortionary price subsidies that had previously been used to disguise the true inflation rate.
1990年代法国在波斯尼亚惨痛的维和经历是他们这种担忧的来源。 在这次行动中法国失去了在限制性“交战规则”指导下执行人道主义使命的84名维和士兵。	The terrible French peacekeeping experience in Bosnia in the early 1990s, in which France lost 84 soldiers serving in a humanitarian capacity under restrictive ROEs, justifies their fears.
纽约—2008年，金融危机爆发后不久，决策者成功地阻止了大衰退滑向第二次大萧条，秘诀就在于阻止了保护主义者和内向政策的要求。	NEW YORK – In the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, policymakers’ success in preventing the Great Recession from turning into Great Depression II held in check demands for protectionist and inward-looking measures.
我们捷克人对此有所了解，因为我们在九十年代经历了艰苦的经济转型，告诉了我们许多道理，也就是正确的政策可以打破绝望钳制。	We Czechs know something about this, as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the 1990’s taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness.

但其实我们可以去建立一个，而G20则是最明智的起点 — — 至少它可以提供适当水平的指导以协助推进外国直接投资政策。	But one can be built, and the G20 is the most sensible place to start. At the very least, the G20 can offer the appropriate level of guidance to help advance FDI policy.
事实上，某些类型的资本流动管理 — — 包括限制企业和家庭以外币计价的国内债务 — — 都被证明能增加抗冲击能力。	Indeed, certain types of capital-flow management – including limiting domestic debt denominated in foreign currency for both firms and households – have been shown to increase resilience.

自2009年以来，在全球化和技术进步的支持下，全球人均GDP每年增长2.5 % — —比大衰退开始前要低，但从历史上看仍然是相当高的水平。	Globalization and technological progress have supported annual global per capita GDP growth of 2.5% since 2009 – lower than before the Great Recession, but still very high by historical standards.
实验经济学家发现，被要求参加分配游戏的实验对象处于倒数第二的位置时，他们会对境况坏于他们的人非常吝啬。	Experimental economists have found that subjects asked to play distribution games become much less generous toward those below them when they are in second-to-last place.
但是，即使欧元区有所缩小并且预算程序有所改进，欧元所面临的基本问题 — — 强迫情况各异的多个国家在单一货币政策和单一汇率安排下运行 — — 仍然无法消除。	But, even with a smaller group of member countries and some changes in budget procedures, the fundamental problems of forcing disparate countries to live with a single monetary policy and a single exchange rate will remain.
如果富国的政府们以实际的方式来思考疟疾的问题，并承认它是一个全面的紧急事件，那么它们就可以支持简单而实用的解决方案：蚊帐和及时可得的药物。	If rich-country governments thought practically about malaria and recognized that it is a full-scale emergency, they could support simple and practical solutions: bed nets and timely access to medicine.
所有这一切都凸显了一场不断深化的道德领导力危机，由此可能造成的损害丝毫不亚于不受控制的移民甚至贸易战。	All of this highlights a deepening crisis of ethical leadership that could do as much damage as uncontrolled migration or even a trade war.
确切地说，布什强化了这两种趋势，但究其原因还在于客观的历史因素，也就是自1989年以来美国在世界上的一家独大和欧洲自作自受的软弱。	To be sure, Bush reinforced both trends, but their real causes lie in objective historical factors, namely America’s being the sole world power since 1989 and Europe’s self-inflicted weakness.
实际上，中国需要一个强大独立的欧洲。 而且从这一点上来看，中国现在直面一个真正多极化的全球体系为时并不太早。	Indeed, China wants a strong and independent Europe, and from that vantage point it is not too early for China to envisage a truly multi-polar global system.

也就是说，被认为是人们相互间的语言、行动以及情感流动的体验，不仅是本地的，而且具有内在的道德性，因为我们的生活就是有关赋予价值和表现价值的。	That is to say, experience, viewed as the flow of words, movements, and emotions between us, is not only local, but also inherently moral, because living our lives is about animating and enacting values.
美国总统特朗普的政府也愿意为他出面，至今依然拒绝承认他在卡舒吉谋杀中的作用并拒绝如外界所呼吁的那样对沙特实施制裁。	And US President Donald Trump’s administration is standing by its man, so far refusing to acknowledge his role in Khashoggi’s murder and resisting calls for sanctions against Saudi Arabia.
“从现在起20年后 ， ” 伊曼纽尔在纽约告诉其它与会市长，我们将看到“民族国家衰落的拐点，而像新加坡这样的城市国家则转而推动文化和经济活动 。 ”	“Twenty years from now,” Emanuel told fellow mayors in New York City, we will see “an inflection point where the nation-state is in decline, and the city-state à la Singapore is driving the cultural and economic activity.”
感到美国相对衰落和欧洲对其价值和模式的信心的日渐深刻的损失导致了通常建立在昔日反美主义遗留的基础上的立场的合理化。	The perception of relative US decline and the EU’s deepening loss of confidence in its values and model seem to legitimize a stance that is built in many cases on the remnants of older anti-Americanism.
Airbnb和在线旅行社Expedia只允许实际使用过服务的客户评价；这有可能成为整个共享经济的监管规范。	Airbnb and the online travel agent Expedia allow reviews only by customers who have actually used their services; that could become a regulatory norm throughout the sharing economy.
我研究过给个人的此项福利占总收入（指“调整后总收入 ” ， 美国税法简称AGI）的百分比设置“上限”的想法。	I have explored the idea of “capping” the benefit that individuals can get as a percentage of their total income (their “adjusted gross income,” or AGI in US tax parlance).
对安倍来说，夏威夷与奥巴马握手等于认同日本的现代和平主义信念，并释放出一个信号：尽管以民族主义者闻名，但他对战争的危险也有着深刻的认识。	By shaking Obama’s hand in Hawaii, Abe will give a nod to the country’s modern pacifist creed, and signal that, despite his reputation as a nationalist, he also harbors deep feelings about the dangers of war.
尽管普京并未明言猎犬的优劣代表了俄美两国的实力，但上述评论却与他所传递的总体信息如出一辙：永远也不要胆敢质疑我们的力量。	Though Putin barely implied that the dog’s superiority indicates Russia’s domination over the US, his remark appears to be in line with his general message: don’t you ever dare to doubt our high status.
那些经常账户赤字数额巨大的国家（印度，南非，以及从波罗的海国家到土耳其的位于东欧的20多个国家）会因为全球信贷紧缩受到不利影响。	Those with large current-account deficits (India, South Africa, and more than 20 economies in East Europe from the Baltics to Turkey) may suffer from the global credit crunch.
一战后以及1980年代和1990年代的下降势头很猛；相反，朝鲜战争后的降幅相对较弱，当时正逢世界经济的繁荣期。	The downswings following World War I and in the 1980’s and 1990’s were strong; in contrast, the dip after the Korean War, when the world economy was booming, was relatively weak.

我听到的说法似乎根本无事可做：叙利亚的防御系统太过强大、问题太过复杂、而且为什么要在没有更好方案的情况下做出选择？	I hear people talk as if nothing can be done: the Syrian defense systems are too powerful, the issues too complex, and in any event, why take sides when one is as bad as the next?
相反，所有以马克思主义的名义拒绝资本主义的体制，都遭到了失败 — — 这不是巧合，也不是因为马克思的信徒不幸地错误理解了马克思的思想。	By contrast, every regime that has rejected capitalism in the name of Marxism has failed – and not by coincidence or as a result of some unfortunate doctrinal misunderstanding on the part of Marx’s followers.
在今年早些时候举行的纽约第14区民主党初选中，民主社会主义人士亚历山大·奥卡西奥·科尔特斯击败了现任众议院议员、在众议院排名第四的民主党人约瑟夫·克劳利。	In the Democratic primary election for New York’s 14th district earlier this year, democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trounced incumbent Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House.
目前为止，历史上还没有非西方的现代化。 有关亚洲价值观的讨论最初起源于新加坡，这基本上是一个政治性讨论。	So far, there is no case in history of non-Western modernization; the discourse on Asian values, initially started in Singapore, is basically a political discourse.
受到西方支持的专制政权多年来把任何可能会取代在位的阿拉伯政权的成长中的自由主义运动都扼杀在襁褓之中，并且任何突然推行的自由选举都演变成伊斯兰民主危险的实施。	Years of Western-backed repressive authoritarianism nipped in the bud any potential growth of a liberal alternative to the incumbent Arab regimes, and turned any abrupt move to free elections into a dangerous exercise in Islamic democracy.
十年后，FBI马上号召所有参与波士顿马拉松的人提供重点线周边区域的照片和视频 — — 只要能够帮助调查者识别投弹者。	A decade later, the FBI immediately called on all who attended the Boston Marathon to send photos and videos of the area around the finish line – anything that could help investigators identify the bombers.
一个无法将自己的孩子与异国他乡的陌生儿童区分开来的人 — — 自觉对两者都有同样的爱和责任 — — 大概也就失去人性了。	An individual who didn’t distinguish between his or her own child and an unknown child in a faraway land – who felt the same love and the same obligation toward both – would hardly be human anymore.
为了维持增长，中国需要继续将其9万亿美元的年度GDP用于投资 — — 这对一个遍地新建高速公路和机场的国家来说实属不易。	In order to sustain growth, it needs to continue to invest half of its $9 trillion annual GDP – no easy task for a country that already has brand new highways and airports.
事实上，一些欧盟领导人对于移民等问题所采取的方针有可能创造系统性问题，哪怕特朗普回归他的充斥着高尔夫和破产事务生活，也会长久存在下去。	In fact, some EU leaders’ approaches to issues like immigration are threatening to create systemic problems that will endure long after Trump has returned to a life of golf courses and bankruptcy courts.

10月，俄罗斯驻联合国大使丘尔金（Vitaly Churkin）表示，美国所领导打击伊斯兰国行动不把伊朗和叙利亚包括在内是不妥的，他把这两个国家称为“打击地区恐怖主义的天然盟友 ” 。	In October, Russia’s United Nations ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, faulted the US-led initiative against the Islamic State for its failure to involve Iran and Syria, which he called “logical allies in the fight against terrorism in the region.”

法庭认为，该法律合理的目的是为具有特殊困难的学生作出教学调节，并且，心理测试看上去是足够客观，并未牵涉到种族偏见。	According to the Court, the law’s legitimate purpose is to adapt teaching to the difficulties of a specific category of pupils, and psychological tests seem to be objective enough not to be suspected of racial bias.
有时候领导人就需要突破现实的藩篱去激励追随者并激发出额外的效应，如同温斯顿·丘吉尔1940年在英国所做的那样。	Sometimes leaders need to stretch the boundaries of realism to inspire their followers and call forth extra effort, as Winston Churchill did in Great Britain in 1940.
一旦他们意识到他们不能威吓ECB进行不必要的自我消亡式的利率降低，欧盟领导人也许能鼓起领导的勇气 — — 这毕竟是他们被选举出来所要完成的任务。	Once they realize they can’t bully the ECB into unwanted and self-destructive interest rate cuts, EU leaders actually might summon up the will to lead—which is, after all, what they have been elected to do.
每个人都有不同的看法，我将提供我自己的2012中东综述，并给出2013年的建议，如果我们想让损失少些的话。	While there have been many prescriptions, I will provide my own 2012 Middle East roundup, with a look toward what must happen in 2013 if we want it to bring fewer losses.

尽管如此，对于金正恩，巴里·戈德华特 — — 另一位局外人转变而来的共和党标志性人物 — — 54年前的智慧仍然成立 ： “ 唯一有可能成功的峰会是没有开成的峰会 。 ”	Nonetheless, when it comes to Kim, a bit of 54-year-old wisdom from Barry Goldwater, another outsider-turned-Republican Party icon, still applies: “The only summit meeting that can succeed is the one that doesn’t take place.”
事实上，纵观历史，政府存在强烈的政治激励将赤字货币化，由此产生的通货膨胀降低了财政负担（以及对被借走的储蓄的实际没收 ） 。	In fact, throughout history, governments have had strong political incentives to monetize the deficit, with the subsequent inflation reducing the debt burden (and effectively confiscating the borrowed savings).
但超级病菌也对现代医学的有效性构成了威胁;如果不解决这一问题，抗生素耐药性会导致更多的感染无法治愈，癌症疗法失效，常规手术无法进行，甚至连分娩也变得不安全。	But superbugs also pose a threat to the effectiveness of modern medicine; if left unaddressed, AMR could make more infections untreatable, cancer therapies ineffective, routine surgeries impossible, and even childbirth unsafe.
但如若美国变得不再热心于世界事务，只愿意付出象��性的代价 — — 俄罗斯的以牙还牙式的制裁就是明证 — — 来阻止威胁到国际社会的入侵会怎样？	But has the US become so withdrawn from the world that it is willing to pay only a symbolic price, such as that implied by Russia’s tit-for-tat sanctions, to stop aggression that threatens the international order?
一个显著的例子是食品供给。 在这一领域，科技在持续生产着日益复杂的转基因食品，而科学家对这些食品的评估才刚刚开始。	A leading example is food supply – an area where technology has continually produced ever-more highly processed and genetically refined food that scientists are only beginning to assess.
今天，巴林的逊尼派统治者鄙视卡塔尔与伊朗的友好关系，指责伊朗伊斯兰共和国挑拨在巴林国内占绝大多数的什叶派人口。	Today, Bahrain’s Sunni rulers despise Qatar’s friendly ties with Iran, accusing the Islamic Republic of fomenting unrest among Bahrain’s majority-Shia population.

类似地，特朗普承诺减少向外国盟友提供资金，以此作为“美国第一”整体战略的一部分，这可能让它们对他当选总统感到不悦。	Likewise, Trump’s promise to reduce funding to foreign allies, as part of a broader “America first” strategy, should be tempering their joy at his victory.

因为如果这些资源都是通过美国自身援助机构拨付的话，相关政策制定就将随着历任政府更替所导致的发展思维变化（或者不作为）而摇摆不定。	Had these resources been channeled through America’s own aid agency, policymaking would have been subject to the vagaries of development thinking (or the absence of reflection) from one administration to another.
也许如广为流传的那样，他在电视上看到死去的和垂死挣扎的儿童的画面时受到了很大的触动；但阿萨德血腥方针的视频证据一直都有。	He may indeed have experienced a spasm of emotion when he saw images of dead and dying children on TV, as has been widely reported; but visual evidence of Assad’s bloody methods has long been available.

JP摩根大通CEO杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）在2015年致股东的信中说得好 — — “硅谷”正在逼近。	Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed it well in his 2015 shareholder letter, observing that “Silicon Valley” is coming.
报告警告说，即使按气候变化移民的最低估计量2,500万人计算 ， “ 也将让当前新难民和国内流民水平小巫见大巫 。 ”	Even the lowest estimate of 25 million climate-change migrants, the report warns, “would dwarf the current levels of new refugees and internally displaced persons.”
作为一个政府办事员的女儿，玛雅瓦提曾攻读法律并做过教师，后来被社会报党（ BSP ）的创始人，已故的Kanshi RAM 发现，并培养了她的政治领导才能。	The daughter of a government clerk, Mayawati studied law and worked as a teacher before being spotted by the BSP’s founder, the late Kanshi Ram, and groomed for political leadership.
但要在美国挑战这个国会“特权”却相当困难，这在某种程度上是因为内幕交易在美国法律中是个模糊概念，同时对“内幕交易者 ” ， “内部信息”或者“内幕交易”都缺乏法律定义。	But it is difficult to challenge this congressional “privilege” in the US, in part because insider trading is an ambiguous concept under US law, with no statutory definitions of the terms “insider,” “inside information,” or “insider trading.”
正如中国的工业化是前所未有的 — — 没有哪个发展中国家可以在整整二十年的时间里不间断地保持每年10%以上的增长，200年前英国的工业化也是前无古人。	Just as Chinese industrialization is unprecedented – no developing country has grown by more than 10% per year without interruption for two full decades – Britain’s industrialization 200 years ago was similarly unparalleled.
里斯本中心大学最近一项海洋学研究表明二氧化碳排放所导致的酸化可能导致到2100年全球鲨鱼数量骤降40 % 。	A recent study by the University of Lisbon’s Center for Oceanography reports that acidification from CO2 emissions could cause the global shark population to decline by as much as 40% by 2100.
这些进步部分可以归因于创新，包括只需要几分钟的新型快速诊断测试、更普及和廉价的抗疟疾药物，以及越来越普遍的长效防虫蚊帐（LLIN）的使用。	Progress can be attributed partly to innovations, including new rapid diagnostic tests that work in just minutes, more accessible and affordable anti-malarial drugs, and rising use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs).
但是，阿萨德已经从2005年叙利亚被迫从黎巴嫩撤离的挫折中成功走了出来，并且成为一个没有他就无法建立黎巴嫩政府、无法选举黎巴嫩总统的中间人。	But Assad managed to emerge from Syria’s forced withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005 to become the broker without whom a Lebanese government could not be created and a president could not be elected.
目前的局势迫在眉睫：核武器不仅仅在拥有核的国家手中，一旦落入无国界的恐怖分子手中 — — 由此可能导致的局面无法想象。	The urgency can hardly be exaggerated: nuclear weapons may come into the possession of states that might use them, as well as of stateless terrorists – creating new threats of unimaginable proportion.
同时，水资源过滤系统、抗旱种子、可再生能源和互联网等现代技术完全可以比任何帝国更好地满足我们这个拥挤星球的基本需求。	At the same time, technologies like water filtration systems, drought-resistant seeds, renewable energy, and the Internet have the potential to fulfill the basic needs of a crowded planet better than any empire could.
在托尔斯泰看来，拿破仑算不上特别出色的将军，他的胜利应该归功于打赢波罗底诺战役的法国士兵的勇气和献身精神。	As far as Tolstoy was concerned, Napoleon was not a particularly good general, and was carried to victory by the courage and commitment of all of the individual French soldiers who won the Battle of Borodino.
在10月份在北京举行的中共十九大上，习近平主席宣布中国进入了“新时代 ” ， 将中国的治理体系作为可供其他国家效仿的模式呈现。	In declaring a “new era” for China during October’s 19th National Congress in Beijing, President Xi Jinping presented the Chinese system of governance as a model for other countries to emulate.
这种批评在那些专制国家尤其常见，他们的统治者和为它们的体制极力辩护的人把普遍人权看成是对他们专制统治的威胁。	To be sure, such accusations are especially common in autocracies whose rulers, and their apologists, view the idea of universal human rights as a threat to their monopoly on power.
但为了最大限度地提升能提供上述技能和机会的工作效率，更不要说确保那些留在非正式行业工作的人不成为政府监督的盲点，就仍然需要开展直接改善数据搜集效率的工作。	But to maximize the effectiveness of efforts to provide those skills and opportunities, not to mention ensuring that those who remain in the informal sector are not invisible, initiatives aimed directly at improving data collection are also needed.
早在20世纪70年代后期，全世界都面临滞涨风险的时候，德国总理施密特（Helmut Schmidt）固执地跟英、法、美国的领导人说，他们搞赤字财政是错误而危险的。	In the late 1970’s, when the world was facing a mixture of stagnant growth and inflation, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt insistently told British, French, and American leaders that their deficits were wrong and dangerous.
甚至非常支持自由贸易 — — 甚至TPP的某些版本 — — 的人，比如伯格斯坦和加尼翁，也认为某些亚洲国家的行为已经超过了合理的边界。	Even people who are very much in favor of freer trade – and even of some version of the TPP, like Bergsten and Gagnon – believe that some Asian countries have overstepped the boundaries of reasonable behavior.
出版主张强硬外交政策、反外国的文章总是能引发密云不雨的民族敏感情绪，并很容易地将其演变为大爆发，其结果就是带来显而易见的利益。	Publishing jingoistic, anti-foreign articles plays to national sensitivities that always simmer, and thus can easily be brought to a boil, with obvious benefits for the bottom line.
即将卸任的总理马里奥·蒙蒂（Mario Monti）所领导的政府完成了主要的养老金改革、削减了公共支出并提高了税收。	Outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government accomplished a major pension reform, cut public spending, and raised taxes.
这次袭击的目标是基地组织二号人物扎瓦赫里。 尽管据报道这一恐怖组织中级别较低的人物被炸身亡，但是他并没有被炸死。	The target of the attack, Al Qaeda’s number two man, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was not among the dead, although lesser figures in the terrorist organization reportedly were.
在这一能源一体化过程中，银行联盟可以提供如何确保共同利益以及在欧盟主要机构 — — 欧盟委员会、欧洲议会、欧洲理事会和欧洲央行 — — 取得平衡的经验。	In this process of energy integration, the banking union offers clues about how to secure common interests and maintain a balance among the EU’s main institutions – the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Council, and the ECB.
存在的问题很多，但是我们还是把它们看成是“家务事 ” ： 许多夫妇会为这样的事情发生争执，但是绝对不会想到要为此离婚。	The list is long, but they might best be thought of as “housekeeping” issues: many a couple can quarrel over them without contemplating divorce.
果真如此的话，那么姗姗来迟十年的欧盟新全球外交和安全政策战略（Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy）就是一件大好事。	If so, then the European Union’s new Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, more than a decade overdue, must be a very good thing.
随着共产主义的垮台，雅尔塔会议所创造的分裂的欧洲已经不见踪影，而欧盟的扩张也不再局限于属于西方阵营的国家。	With communism’s collapse, the divided Europe created at Yalta disappeared, and EU expansion was no longer confined to states belonging to the Western orbit.
一国的成功 — — 不论用其皇帝的荣光、其领土的扩大、其边界的安全，还是其人口的福利来衡量 — — 都取决于其人民的健康。	A country’s success – whether measured by the glory of its Kaiser, the expansion of its territory, the security of its borders, or the well-being of its population – rests on the health of its people.
中国的支持者们指出1998年的《欧盟关于武器出口的行为规范》能有效限制军火销售，但是他们想当然地忽略了一个事实，即该行为规范属于“自愿”性质，对各成员国不具强制性。	China apologists claim that the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is sufficient to limit arms sales. But they conveniently ignore the fact that the Code of Conduct is voluntary and thus not enforceable.
而且，在伦敦20国首脑会议的预备阶段，该组织彻底地对其贷款政策进行了革新，不再强调一贯执行的制约性，让实行了让各国能容易获得贷款的方法。	And, in the run-up to the G-20 summit in London, it thoroughly overhauled its lending policies, de-emphasizing traditional conditionality and making it easier for countries to qualify for loans.
但经合组织的2012 年报告发现，土耳其学生的较低考试分数中只有15%可以归因于社会经济地位，优于经合组织平均水平。	But the OECD’s 2012 report found that only 15% of lower test scores among Turkish students could be explained by their socioeconomic standing, a better outcome than the OECD average.
尤其是中国在过去十多年中奉行了一个创造大量经常账户顺差并积累外汇储备的战略，使其当前的外汇储备总额达到3万亿美元之巨。	In particular, China has followed a strategy in the past decade or so that entails running large current-account surpluses and building up foreign-exchange reserves, which are now reported to be in excess of $3 trillion.
尽管死于这场海啸灾难的达到200，000人之多，可每月还有同样数目的非洲儿童死于疟疾，我把这场灾难称之为“沉默的海啸 ” 。	But, while more than 200,000 people perished in the tsunami disaster, an equivalent number of children die each month of malaria in Africa, a disaster I call a “silent tsunami.”
习近平的政治未来取决于其兑现改革承诺的能力，因此最应该防范的就是被对外政策转移了注意力 — — 更不用说灾难性的军事实例了。	With his political future depending on his ability to deliver on his reform promises, the last thing Xi needs is a foreign-policy distraction – let alone a disastrous military misadventure.
所有这些都是一个成功，这不仅对废除死刑的极端人士而言如此，而且对于废除死刑协会、意大利政府、欧盟及其在全世界的朋友而言也是如此。	All this is a success, not only for anti-death penalty radicals, for the “Hands off Cain” association, the Italian government, and for the European Union and its friends in the world.
从现在到2015年9月各国首脑齐聚联合国大会期间，我们拥有一个历史性机会为世界设计更加可持续的道路，从而消灭贫困、改善所有人的前景。	Between now and September 2015, when heads of state will gather for the UN General Assembly, we have a historic chance to set the world on a more sustainable path that will eradicate poverty and enhance prosperity for all.
因此，莫拉莱斯的统治是三大标志性领域的成功融合：民族主义情绪、对穷人的关注和玻利维亚人越来越强烈的民族自豪感。	Thus, Morales’s leadership brought together three strongly symbolic dimensions: nationalist sentiment, concern for the poor, and emerging ethnic pride among Bolivia’s native peoples.
最新北约数据表明，2017年德国在防务设备和研发方面的支出只有GDP的0.17 % ， 而法国为0.42 % ， 英国为0.47 % 。	The latest NATO data show German spending on defense equipment and on research and development running at only 0.17% of GDP in 2017, compared to 0.42% in France and 0.47% in the UK.
对以色列而言这意味着永久性的占领西岸和东耶路撒冷，从而不得不面对在数量上远胜于己的阿拉伯人，而这将削弱他们建国的基础 — — 民主和法治 — — 进而影响其地位的合法性。	For Israelis, this would mean permanent occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and thus reckoning with an Arab majority, which would erode the foundations of their state – democracy and the rule of law – and thus its legitimacy.
虽然没有那种比较是完美的，但最贴切的莫过于将特朗普比作贝卢斯科尼，这位意大利媒体大亨在国内连续三届担任总理。	While no comparison is perfect, the most apt comparison is with Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul who has served three terms as his country’s prime minister.
学者们将陷于现有方法 — — 即该学科中已被接受的语言和假设 — — 无法自拔，他们的研究也将陷入循环和琐碎的无用功。	Scholars can become so trapped in their methods – in the language and assumptions of the accepted approach to their discipline – that their research becomes repetitive or trivial.
在马来西亚，代理银行监管（保护消费者利益，同时支持金融机构的业务模式）帮助无分支银行业务进入此前无法提供服务的农村地区。	In Malaysia, agent-banking regulation (which safeguards consumers’ interests while supporting financial institutions’ business models) has led to the expansion of branchless banking to reach previously unserved rural areas.
此外，阿根廷政府还加入了雄心联盟（High Ambition Coalition ） ， 该联盟是确保2015年巴黎气候协定缔结成功的重要因素。	Furthermore, the Argentine government now participates in the High Ambition Coalition, which was instrumental in securing the 2015 Paris climate accord.
加利福尼亚州其实正面临着一个两难困境：一面是当前过分严厉的政策带来的巨大政府开支和社会犯罪，二是合法交易后吸食者增加所带来的负面影响，而大麻政策则试图两害相权取其轻。	Marijuana policy involves a choice between the evils of current repressive policies and the evils of increased use under a legal market.
习近平的反腐运动已经“拿下”了中国权力最大的“大老虎 ” — —中共政治局常务委员会的一位退休委员。	Xi’s anti-corruption campaign has gone as far as taking down a retired member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China’s most powerful body.
如此规模在全球劳动力市场的汪洋大海中只算得上一片小浪花，只相当于被信息技术“自动化”掉的岗位数量的零头。	These are mere drops in the ocean of the global labor market, replacing very few of the jobs that information technology has automated away.
非洲农业部门要想实现它的承诺 — — 如果非洲想要继续经济增长 — — 决策者就需要考虑乔伊斯这样的农民的需要。	If Africa’s agricultural sector is to achieve its promise – and if Africa’s economic growth is to continue – policymakers should take into account the needs of farmers like Joyce.
幸运的是，中国领导人意识到如果坐视世界经济深陷资产负债表衰退状态，那么因国际贸易形势持续疲软而导致的全球总需求缺乏就将进一步拖累中国的经济增长。	Fortunately, China’s leaders recognize that, if the world remains mired in a balance-sheet recession, the lack of aggregate demand, by continuing to weaken trade, will drag down their own country’s growth.
在印度人民党的忠实信徒看来，统治印度数百年的穆斯林是外来侵略者，他们掠夺了富饶的土地，摧毁了寺庙和宫殿，奴役和歧视印度教徒，奸淫印度教妇女，并迫使数百万人皈依了伊斯兰教。	To BJP true believers, the Muslims who ruled India for centuries were foreign invaders who despoiled a prosperous land, destroyed temples and palaces, enslaved and discriminated against Hindus, assaulted Hindu women, and converted millions to Islam.
作为这些资金的交换 — — 这些资金往往被用于耗资巨大的国家工程甚至政治选战 — — 财阀能获得有利的条件，比如廉价银行贷款和有利的监管规则。	In exchange for that money, which is used to finance costly state projects or even political campaigns, the chaebols gain favors, such as cheap bank loans or preferential regulations.
约翰·凯恩斯说 ， “ 长期看，我们都死了 ， ” 这固然正确，但人的一生确确实实是一段相当长的时间。	John Maynard Keynes was correct that “in the long run we are all dead,” but the human life span can be quite a long run, indeed.
这并不是说巴基斯坦的伊斯兰主义者即将走上复兴之路，或者巴基斯坦人必须在一个不受欢迎的独裁者和一个塔利班式的政府之间做出选择。	This is not to suggest than an Islamist awakening in Pakistan is on the horizon, or that Pakistanis must choose between an unpopular autocrat or a Taliban-style government.
这雷区的形式可能是不透明的全球信用泛滥，其背后的推手是由“大而不能倒”的全球银行体系和规模巨大但几乎不为人知、不受监管的影子银行部门所组成的脆弱混合体。	It is likely to take the form of an opaque global credit glut, turbocharged by the fragile mixture of too-big-to-fail global banking with a huge and largely unwatched and unregulated shadow banking sector.
与此同时，对粮食、饲料和燃料生物质的全球需求在不断增加，这反过来推高了土地的价值 — — 这一事实从未逃脱国际投资者的目光。	At the same time, global demand for food, fodder, and biomass for fuels is growing, in turn driving up the value of land – a fact that has not escaped international investors’ attention.
他还推出了一份以市场为导向的医疗保险法案，该法案是仿效罗姆尼在担任马萨诸塞州共和党州长期间实行的法案而推出的。	And he pushed through a market-oriented health-care bill modeled after legislation that Mitt Romney had enacted while serving as the Republican governor of Massachusetts.
“我知道你们的生意现在相当好 ， ” 他说 ， “ 这个国家在过去几个月总是缺少点精气神，而现在全都有了 。 ”	“I know your business is now doing very well,” he observed, “and there’s a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren’t having so much in the last number of months that you have right now.”
如果真的如此，对丘吉尔的怀旧恐怕很难与美国的活力扯上关系，而更像是一个衰落国家一场浪漫而又徒劳无益的战斗。	If so, nostalgia for Churchill is hardly a sign of American vitality, but more like a romantic rearguard battle, typical of a country in decline.
答案在于中国所遇到的前所未有的挑战，包括腐败、污染、不可持续的地方债务 、 “ 鬼城 ” 、 影子银行、效率低下的国有企业、政府对经济的过度控制等。	The answer lies in the unprecedented challenges that China faces, including corruption, pollution, unsustainable local debts, ghost towns, shadow banks, inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and excessive government control over the economy.
某些试点项目已经将这些工具和政策成功纳入中低收入国家由捐款人赞助的艾滋病毒/艾滋病及其他传染性疾病项目。	Pilot programs have successfully integrated these tools and policies into donor-funded programs on HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries.
大多数人仅仅是偿还房屋按揭贷款，交纳法定的国家或者私人养老金(如果他们有的话 ) ， 再有存一些钱用于不时之需。	Most people just pay off their mortgage, make the mandatory contributions to their state or private pension (if they have one), and keep some money for short-run contingencies.
但如果你像我一样认为过去八年的慢增长主要原因是债务积压以及2008年危机所引起的恐慌，那么就不难相信正常化也许比我们所认为的近得多。	But if one believes, as I do, that the slow growth of the last eight years was mainly due to the overhang of debt and fear from the 2008 crisis, then it is not so hard to believe that normalization could be much closer than we realize.
（欧洲央行行长之职落到了另一位经济学家技术官僚德拉基身上，事实上，他可以说是这一位子的理想之选。 ）	(The ECB presidency then went to another economist and technocrat, Mario Draghi, who is, in fact, the perfect man for the job.)
片中最重要的人类角色威尔·罗德曼（由詹姆斯·弗朗克扮演）是一位用人猿作实验品来寻找老年痴呆症疗法的科学家。	The central human character, Will Rodman (played by James Franco), is a scientist seeking a cure for Alzheimer’s disease who experiments on apes.
在与南苏丹总统基尔（Salva Kiir）的多次谈话中，我们讨论了为这个新国家设定明确优先事项短名单的事项。	In many conversations with South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, we have discussed setting out a short list of clear priorities for the new state.
对福岛核电站来说，一波千年一遇的海啸和一个平时不太要紧的设计瑕疵碰到了一起，最终引发几座反应堆冷却水断供并导致严重核辐射泄漏。	For the Fukushima nuclear-power plant, a 1,000-year flood and ordinarily innocuous design defects combined to deprive the reactors of circulating water coolant and cause serious radiation leaks.
在第二次辩论中，人们显然接受了旧奥巴马的消失和新奥巴马的初次登场 — — 存在的、真实的、触手可及的、在椭圆办公室工作的奥巴马。	At the second debate, the loss of the old Obama was apparently accepted and a new one –existing, real, available, and now working in the Oval Office – made its first appearance.
更具竞争力的汇率增加了日本出口商的利润，却没有增加它们的产出，而日元贬值也导致进口价格上升，降低了大多数日本家庭的实际收入。	The more competitive exchange rate raised the profits of Japanese exporters, but not their output, while the weaker yen also raised import prices, reducing the real incomes of most Japanese households.
录像公布后特朗普的民调支持率大幅下降，而候选人否认自己曾抚摸或袭击女性对本党选情造成了雪上加霜的后果 — — 他的表态迫使数名女性站出来否定他。	Trump’s drop in the polls since the tape’s release has changed that, and the candidate has made matters worse for his party by denying that he has groped or assaulted women – a claim that impelled numerous women to come forward and say otherwise.
在这一新的竞争环境中，石油将像任何普通大宗商品一样交易，沙特阿拉伯的垄断将被打破，北美的生产成本将给长期价格带来每桶50美元左右的上限，原因我在1月已经讨论过了。	In this newly competitive environment, oil will trade like any normal commodity, with the Saudi monopoly broken and North American production costs setting a long-term price ceiling of around $50 a barrel, for reasons I set out in January.
先进国家通常所青睐的知识产权标准不是为了最大限度地实现创新和科学进步，而是致力于最大限度地扩大大型制药企业以及其他能够左右贸易谈判者的得利。	The IP standards advanced countries favor typically are designed not to maximize innovation and scientific progress, but to maximize the profits of big pharmaceutical companies and others able to sway trade negotiations.
这一点相当重要，因为其揭示了由于地域差异所造成的拉丁美洲和加勒比海地区在对华贸易上的差异。 南美洲基本物资的出口和中国对于墨西哥出口的持续增长是造成这一现象的原因。	This is important because it illustrates the dissimilar regional impact that trade with China has on Latin America and the Carribean, owing to the export of South America’s basic goods, coupled with the growth of Chinese imports into Mexico.
当世界上有许多国家都能按动核按钮时要维护和平会变得尤其困难 — — 而一旦失败所带来的后果将是毁灭性的。	Maintaining peace in a world in which literally dozens of fingers are on nuclear triggers will be far more difficult—and the consequences of failure far more destructive.
包括巴西、俄罗斯、印度、墨西哥、阿根廷、泰国、印尼、马来西亚和中东石油出口国在内的其他新兴市场经常账户盈余自20世纪90年代初起就显著增加。	Other emerging markets – including Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Middle Eastern oil exporters – have all increased their current-account surpluses significantly since the early 1990’s.
定向压迫、关押反对派领导人、新闻审查、短缺、通货膨胀和暴力肆虐 — — 加拉加斯已成为世界上最危险的城市之一 — — 从中期看，局面已难以为继。	Targeted repression, imprisonment of opposition leaders, press censorship, shortages, inflation, and wanton violence – Caracas is one the world’s most dangerous cities – have created a situation that appears untenable in the medium term.
但有一点越来越明晰：那就是过于强大或先天存在缺陷的知识产权可能实际上会阻碍创新¾而且阻碍的方式绝不仅仅限于增加研究成本。	But it has become increasingly clear that excessively strong or badly formulated intellectual property rights may actually impede innovation – and not just by increasing the price of research.
现在，在中国共产党管理经济的能力似乎在经受考验的时候，它的一揽子经济刺激计划意味着，在人们的工作机会或经济增长目标受到威胁的时候，中国可以为绕开环境保护开绿灯。	Now, with the Party’s ability to manage the economy seemingly at stake, its stimulus package implies a green light to bypass environmental regulations if jobs or growth targets are in jeopardy.
该课程基本上属于一门法证宏观经济学（forensic macroeconomics）课程 — — 从现代日本经济的兴衰中提炼一些核心经验教训，然后找出那些教训与其他主要经济体的相关性。	The course is primarily one in forensic macroeconomics – distilling key lessons from the rise and fall of the modern Japanese economy and then figuring out the relevance of those lessons for other major economies.
与此同时，数字支付系统 — — 欧美的PayPal，Venmo等系统；中国的支付宝和微信；肯尼亚的M-Pesa；印度的Paytm — — 都能提供原本归属于传统商业银行的有吸引力的替代服务。	At the same time, digital payment systems – PayPal, Venmo, and others in the West; Alipay and WeChat in China; M-Pesa in Kenya; Paytm in India – offer attractive alternatives to services once provided by traditional commercial banks.
塞浦路斯银行只需要提供微不足道的风险溢价，就能够在欧洲任何地方筹集任何数量的客户资金，转动比过去更大的财富之轮。	Banks in Cyprus would be able to collect any amount of customer funds from anywhere in Europe by offering minimal risk premiums, allowing them to spin an even bigger wheel of fortune than they did in the past.
（另外一个被选中的国家伊拉克同样被原来的禁穆令所激怒；其他目标国包括利比亚、索马里、苏丹、叙利亚和也门 ） 。	(Iraq, one of the other states singled out, was equally incensed by the original order; the other countries targeted were Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen).
虽然协议条款规定以三年为限，但乌克兰政府实际放弃了对顿巴斯地区的控制权，并将该地区交给由俄罗斯雇佣的分离主义分子。	Under that agreement, Ukraine’s government ceded de facto control of the Donbas region, supposedly for only three years, to Russia’s hired secessionists.
尽管有关政府和央行急着想对策，但有一种深刻的心理机制阻碍着债务问题的有序解决：我们不太把欠陌生人的债当回事儿。	While governments and central banks race frantically to find a solution, there is a profound psychological dynamic at work that stands in the way of an orderly debt workout: our aversion to recognizing obligations to strangers.
如果意大利雄心勃勃的最低收入和加大公共投资计划得到落实的话，他们很快就会陷入与IMF的艰苦谈判之中。	If the Italians’ grandiose plans for a minimum income and more public investment are implemented, they might soon find themselves in difficult discussions with the Fund.
再进一步试想一下，它们的中央银行尽管不愿意继续采取非常规货币政策进一步扩大规模，但也不愿意妨碍当选政府的经济刺激措施，让它们难堪。	Suppose further that their central banks, while unwilling to extend themselves further in unconventional monetary policy, are also unwilling to stymie elected governments’ policies by offsetting their efforts to stimulate their economies.
当尼克松披上“狂人”伪装时，他其实是在某种程度上借鉴了赫鲁晓夫的实例，赫鲁晓夫既是我的祖父，也是尼克松在担任美国副总统期间的对手。	When Nixon adopted his own “mad” persona, he was in some ways drawing on the example of Nikita Khrushchev, my grandfather and Nixon’s adversary during his tenure as US vice president.
除非问题的根源 — — 储蓄短缺，并且面对特朗普不可避免地将扩大联邦预算赤字的局面，这一问题可能进一步恶化 — — 得到解决，否则美国经常项目和贸易赤字将进一步扩大。	Unless the source of the problem – a saving shortfall that is likely to worsen in the face of Trump’s inevitable widening of federal budget deficits –is addressed, America’s current-account and trade deficits will only widen.
委员会的成员也确实意识到伦敦失去全球金融中心地位对就业和产出来说损失很严重，所以他们还准备了第二套说辞。	The commission’s members do recognize that London’s loss of status as a global financial center would be costly in terms of jobs and output, so they developed a second line of argument.
其在建立联合国和世界银行等正式机构上所表现出来的灵光一现的创造力和支持让位给了对孱弱、非正式和临时性组织的偏好，比如各种“G-某”集团和“意愿联盟 ” 。	Its inspired creativity and support in building formal institutions like the United Nations and World Bank has given way to a predilection for weak, informal, and ad hoc groupings, such as the various G-somethings and “coalitions of the willing.”
今年在巴厘岛上举行的东盟首脑会议本已达成协议，采用双边协商来解决这一区域的领土纷争，无奈中国的霸道声明从一开始就决定了这个协议的悲剧命运。	At this year’s ASEAN summit in Bali, it was agreed that these territorial disputes be settled through bilateral negotiations.
以色列在约旦河西岸消灭哈马斯恐怖分子的行动也应该停止－或者至少在可能的情况下最大限度的减少这样的行动－并且允许巴勒斯坦当局用他们自己的方法来对付他们。	The killing by Israel of Hamas terrorists in the West Bank should also be stopped – or at least limited as much as possible – and the Palestinian Authority should be permitted to deal with them in their own way.
比如，环境污染的恶化威胁到生活水平，而收入和财富不平等已可以与美国相提并论，腐败在公私机构和部门中横行。	Worsening environmental pollution, for example, threatens living standards, while inequality of income and wealth now rivals that of the United States and corruption pervades public institutions and the private sector alike.
管理人员用这些指标评估他们聘用和给予资金支持的人的生产率，追踪他们所承担的研发项目的下游影响，丝毫不关注这些指标的局限性。	Administrators are using such measures to assess the productivity of those they hire and fund, and track the downstream impact of the research and development projects they underwrite, with little regard for the limitations of such indices.
果真如此的话，对于这一经验 — — 以及我们自身 — — 恐怕没有比弗雷德里希·尼采更好的指导了。 尼采是他所在的时代最有洞察力的思想家。	If so, there are few better guides to that experience – and our own – than Friedrich Nietzsche, one of the most perceptive thinkers of his time.
但如今这些土地开始解冻并释放出沼气，并因此而导致进一步暖化 — — 以及进一步解冻和更多沼气的释放。	But areas that used to be frozen are now thawing, releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming – and to further thawing, which releases more methane.
议案最终得以通过，恰恰是因为联署人达成一致，把存款保险同银行监管新规绑定在一起，搞出一个谁都有所需要的方案。	The final bill passed only when its sponsors agreed to combine deposit insurance with new banking regulation, creating a package with something for everyone.
这是一个坚实的开端，而且我们应当鼓励发展此类合同以便帮助数以十亿计的人们防范通货膨胀和通货紧缩风险。	This is a real beginning, and we should encourage such contracts to grow in order to help billions of people hedge their inflation and deflation risks.
在反恐怖主义方面，发生在孟买的悲剧事件凸显了推动情报共享、联合反应训练和人员交流以挫败我们这个时代最迫切威胁的真正机遇。	In terms of counterterrorism, the tragic events in Mumbai present an opportunity to ratchet up intelligence sharing, joint response training, and personnel exchanges to defeat the defining threat of our times.
然而，眼下正有传言，说 IMF 总裁多米尼克·施特劳斯 — 卡恩打算卸任，参加 2012 年法国总统大选，跟萨尔科齐一角高低。	Now, however, the rumor mill is heating up with gossip that the Fund’s managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, will leave in order to oppose Nikolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential elections.
通过采取综合性举措 — — 包括限制卖酒时间、回收公共空间和改善警察及司法系统 — — 2004年谋杀率下降到每100,000人21起谋杀。	By taking an integrated approach – limiting the hours during which alcohol can be sold, reclaiming public space, and improving the police and justice systems – the homicide rate was reduced to 21 per 100,000 in 2004.
正如阿拉伯之春所显示的那样，互联网能将本地事件迅速转化为全国性的爆点 — — 将新的互联性转化成引发政治不稳定和混乱的潜在源头。	As the Arab Spring demonstrated, the Internet can quickly transform local incidents into national flashpoints – turning the new connectivity into a potential source of political instability and turmoil.
其他小型经济体（主要是欧盟的新成员，它们有很大的经常账户赤字）面临着资本流入突然逆转的风险；这可能已经在拉脱维亚，爱沙尼亚，冰岛以及新西兰发生。	Other smaller economies (mostly the new members of the EU, which all have large current-account deficits) risk a sudden reversal of capital inflows; this may already be occurring in Latvia and Estonia, as well as in Iceland and New Zealand.
在一个有限的世界中，无限增长不可能实现，不断增长的产出也不会把食品送上所有人的餐桌，除非增长的好处被公平分配。	In a finite world, infinite growth is impossible, and rising output will not put food on everyone’s table if the benefits of growth are not fairly distributed.
在全球化世界中，很多人同属于想象中的共同体 — — 包括地方、区域、国家���世界 — — 上述共同体多以互联网和低成本旅行作为支撑。	In a world of globalization, many people belong to a number of imagined communities – local, regional, national, cosmopolitan – that are overlapping circles sustained by the Internet and inexpensive travel.
这就要求挑选合适人选负责相关事务，挑��像半个世纪多以前参与实施马歇尔计划，后来又负责联合国开发项目的美国实业家保罗·霍夫曼那样的人。	Doing so requires putting the right person in charge — someone like Paul Hoffman, the American industrialist who managed the Marshall Plan more than half a century ago and, subsequently, headed the UN Development Program.
保护森林的支付开始在联合国REDD+计划的支持下流动起来，绿色气候基金（Green Climate Fund）也将为森林保护提供5亿美元。 但可持续土地使用方面的总公共投资仍然不足。	While payments to conserve forests are starting to flow under the UN’s REDD+ program, and the Green Climate Fund has committed $500 million for forest protection payments, total public investment in sustainable land use remains inadequate.
像苹果、亚马逊和星巴克这样的大型跨国公司已经为避税重组了公司结构，以至于它们现在面临像欧盟等政体的制裁。	Major multinationals like Apple, Amazon, and Starbucks have structured their businesses to minimize taxes to such an extent that they are now facing sanctions from the likes of the European Union.
随着独生一代老龄化 — — 每年将增加大约1,000万退休者 — — 这一比例将会猛增，支持中国经济奇迹的劳动力剩余将变成遏制增长的严重短缺。	As the one-child generation ages – adding some ten million retirees annually – this ratio will skyrocket, with the labor surplus that supported China’s economic miracle giving way to a severe shortage that depresses growth.
此外，出口的增加以及用国产商品和服务替代进口品的也将提振经济，从而与税收的增加和转移支付的减少一道减少财政赤字。	Moreover, the increase in exports and the shift from imports to domestically produced goods and services would strengthen their economies, thereby reducing their fiscal deficits as tax revenues rose and transfers declined.
事实上，默克尔别无选择，只能让步并同意欧盟新财政契约的深刻变化 — — 放松对危机国家及其银行的再融资。	Indeed, she had no choice but to concede and agree to far-reaching changes to the EU’s new fiscal compact that will ease refinancing of the crisis countries and their banks.
即便如此，为响应习近平关于做大做强现有国企的号召，意见起草者提出更多措施以最小化拙劣公司治理带来的风险是很有意义的。	Even so, to be responsive to Xi’s call to strengthen and expand existing SOEs, it makes sense for the guidelines’ drafters to propose more measures to minimize risks stemming from poor corporate governance.
维也纳 — — 当前，在全球金融危机的背景下，我们面临的最大的挑战在于，我们无法控制它的复杂性和多样性。	VIENNA – The greatest challenge of the current global financial crisis is the seeming impossibility of comprehending and managing its diversity.
2010到2025年近半数的全球GDP增长将来自440个新兴市场城市，其中不少西方高管甚至可能都从未听说。	Nearly half of global GDP growth from 2010 to 2025 will come from 440 emerging-market cities, many of which Western executives may not even know exist.
与此同时，哈马斯认为阿巴斯争取联合国承认的努力是为了给内塔尼亚胡施压，从而重启基于1967年边境线的和平谈判。 哈马斯是不承认1967年边境线的。	At the same time, Hamas suspects that Abbas’s effort to gain UN recognition is intended to impose pressure on Netanyahu to revive peace negotiations on the basis of the 1967 borders, a position that Hamas rejects.
城市化进程不可避免：拥有12亿人的经济体不可能让三分之二的人留在农村还期望增长；农村居民将不可避免地转移到城市寻找工作和更好的生活。	Urbanization is inevitable: an economy of 1.2 billion people cannot employ two-thirds of them in agriculture and hope to grow; rural people will inevitably move to cities to seek work and better lives.
而他们道德负担的日渐减少是基于一种认可：是他们正确预测了马杜罗政府决定就算饿死人民也不会重组您所持有的债券。	The less morally burdened among them bask in the recognition they receive for having been right to predict that Maduro’s government would decide to starve its people rather than restructure the bonds you hold.
有了作为“希望回归”化身的全新总统，美国人信心满满，重新燃起了希望。 他们开始认为，经济最坏的时刻已经过去。	Comforted by a new President who incarnates a return of hope, who inspires and reassures at the same time, Americans are starting to believe that the worst of the economic crisis is behind them.
新签定的协议把乌克兰的能源需求交给一个与国际犯罪联系密切的影子公司全盘掌控，这样就为新的、也许是更加凶险的危机埋下了伏笔。	By placing Ukraine’s energy needs in the hands of a shadowy company linked to international criminals, the agreement has planted the seeds of new and perhaps more dangerous crises.
在这本书中，我们探讨了评估小组推荐的十大干预举措 — — 我将这些举措称之为“十诫 ” — —同时还考量了迄今为止所取得的进展，以及仍需完成哪些工作。	In it, we discuss the Review’s ten recommended interventions – what I call the Ten Commandments – while considering the progress made so far, and the work that still needs to be done.
首先 ， “ 核威胁或使用核武器总体而言违反适用于武装冲突的国际法规则，特别是人道主义法律规则的原则 。 ”	First, “the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law.”
但当然，潜台词是如果这种对地产的病态痴迷导致了一种爱情的实用主义，那么它同时也可能引发一场令许多经济学忧虑不已，担心会迅速爆破的地产泡沫。	But, of course, the sub-text is that if this fixation on property has also led to greater pragmatism in affairs of the heart, it has also led to a worrisome property bubble that many economists now fear could soon burst.
而对常任理事国否决权的其中一个限制 — — 关于争端当事国不得投票的要求 — — 则强调了在安理会做出决定时保持某种中立态度的重要性。	The one limit on the permanent members’ veto power – the requirement that a party to a dispute must abstain from voting – underscores the importance of maintaining some semblance of neutrality when making decisions in the Security Council.
— — 政府不愿意公开说明彻底解决问题所需要投入的真正金额，现在给予银行的救助还不够，只能说是救急，而不能使得经济真正得以好转。	- Governments do not like to admit the full costs of the problem, so they give the banking system just enough to survive, but not enough to return it to health.
但现在，他们必须选择是要在极左和极右翼遭到欧洲怀疑论政党的包抄，亦或是成立超国家民主制度来应对上述威胁，并解除选民的合理忧虑。	Now, though, they must choose between being outflanked by Euroskeptic parties on both the far left and far right, or responding to that threat by creating a supra-national democracy that can satisfy voters’ legitimate concerns.
非洲城市所受到的影响最为突出，白米、冷冻鸡肉、面包、黄油、鸡蛋甚至碳酸饮料的价格要比世界其他城市至少高出24 % 。	The impact is most pronounced in African cities, where prices for white rice, frozen chicken, bread, butter, eggs, and even carbonated soft drinks are at least 24% higher than in other cities around the world.
用不了多久，复杂性问题便能够解决，而全球供应链的线性模式（在A国生产，在B国被消费）便让位给了包括更碎片化但也更高效的供给网络的更复杂的模式。	With only a slight lag, complexity became manageable, and global supply chains’ linear model (something produced in country A is consumed in country B) gave way to a more complex model with more fragmented but more efficient supply networks.
李克强仅容忍经济在一定程度上放缓是因为GDP增长低于8%不仅无助于完成结构改革，还有可能导致社会动荡并损害中国经济。	The view that Li will tolerate slower growth only above a particular threshold is based on the belief that GDP growth below 8% would hurt economic development more than it helped, and lead to social instability.
一个由激进左翼联盟带领的政府必须适当柔化缓和其方法和承诺，它将继续坚持改革和限制支出以换取大量减少其债务负担 — — 这也是三驾马车所愿意接受的。	A Syriza-led government must moderate its approach and promise that it will continue to pursue reform and limit spending in exchange for a substantial reduction to its debt burden – a reduction that the troika must be willing to grant.
一些发达经济特的金融制度 — — 如澳大利亚、加拿大和新加坡 — — 显示出了卓著的韧性，但其他则陷入了麻烦。	Some financial systems in developed economies – for example, in Australia, Canada, and Singapore – have shown remarkable resilience, while others have gotten into trouble.
事实上，只有当你认为该时期政策是合理的，或者更切题一些，类似的政策在未来也是合理的，泰勒规则才是是合理政策指南。	Indeed, a Taylor rule is a guide for desirable policy only if one thinks that the policies followed in that period were desirable, or, more to the point, that similar policies will be desirable in the future.
这也是一个明确的标志，说明美国的收入失衡状况已经上升到了不仅威胁经济发展，同时也威胁到了民主体制健康运行的程度。	This is a clear sign that income inequality in the US has risen to levels that threaten not only the economy’s growth, but also the health of its democracy.
自1960年代起，在北爱尔兰，法国的科西嘉岛，意大利的南蒂罗尔以及西班牙的巴斯克等地区，炸弹与死亡已经成了当地的家常便饭。	From the 1960’s onwards, bombs and death were the order of the day in regions like Northern Ireland, Corsica (France), South Tyrol (Italy), and the Basque country (Spain).
但是，依托新造的南海据点，中国不但能够更好地保持地区内的空域和海域巡逻，还能推进器在印度洋和西太平洋展示实力的战略。	But, from its newly built perches in the South China Sea, China is better positioned not only to sustain air and sea patrols in the region, but also to advance its strategy of projecting power across the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific.
然而，他解释说 ： “ 当时，我们认为如果能够突出这部分内容，那么它将会对政策制定者和政治家产生影响，从而鼓励他们采取一些具体的行动 。 ”	Nonetheless, he explained, “we thought that if we can highlight it, it will impact policy-makers and politicians and encourage them to take some concrete action.”
事实上，在1990年华沙的一次会议是上，波兰总统、共产党总书记雅鲁泽尔斯基将军（General Wojciech Jaruzelski）对我和我的内阁同僚宣布“历史的力量不可避免地将我们引向资本主义 。 ”	Indeed, at a meeting in Warsaw in the winter of 1990, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland’s President and communist party boss, declared to me and my cabinet colleagues that “The forces of history have inevitably led us to capitalism.”
在各行各业中都可以找到零和活动；一个制造企业可以聘请帮忙减少应缴税费的税务会计师以及专注于金融工程的高级管理人员。	And zero-sum activities can be found in all sectors; manufacturing companies can employ tax accountants to minimize liabilities and top executives who focus on financial engineering.
中国还有人说美国抓住食品和产品安全问题是限制中国进口以及减少双边贸易赤字战略的一部分。 这一说法实际上没有根据。	There are also those in China who argue that the US focus on food and product safety is part of a strategy to restrict Chinese imports and reduce the bilateral trade deficit. This argument has no basis in fact.
否则 — — 放任印度法律继续成为束缚某些印度人民的牢笼 — — 将直接破坏构成印度民主基石的身份和言论自由。	The alternative – allowing Indian law to continue to serve as an iron cage for some of our people – would directly undermine the freedom of identity and expression that constitutes the backbone of Indian democracy.
其一是政治上的，与主权有关：欧洲的全面团结只能通过更强大的财政和货币联邦主义来实现，这能令欧元区在存在少数反对声音的情况下可以有所行动。	The first is political and involves sovereignty: Full European solidarity can be achieved only through stronger fiscal and monetary federalism, which would enable the eurozone to act, despite minority dissent.
当罗伯特·舒曼和康拉德·阿登纳创立欧洲煤钢共同体的时候，决定性的法国领导开始实现欧洲统一的第一个历史时刻来临了。	The first moment when decisive French leadership began to unify Europe came when Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer created the European Coal and Steel Community.
虽然巴基斯坦军队花了很长一段时间才平定了当地不断爆发的暴力和骚乱活动，但巴军在南瓦齐里斯坦地区的行动也确实取得了成效。	It took a while for the Pakistani Army to move against the region’s rising violence and chaos, but its campaign in South Waziristan is making progress.
当古列尔莫·马可尼（Guglielmo Marconi）在一个世纪之前实现首次跨大西洋无线电传输时，还只是想在点对点传输方面和电报竞争；却从未预见大众广播收音机会因此诞生。	When Guglielmo Marconi made the first transatlantic wireless transmission over a century ago, he was competing with the telegraph in point-to-point communication; he never envisioned popular mass-broadcast radio.
当联合政府在三年前上台执政之时，英国的赤字总量估计将超过任何一个G20集团成员国，相当于本国GDP的11%强。	When the coalition government came to office three years ago, the United Kingdom’s deficit was forecast to be higher than that of any other country in the G-20, at more than 11% of GDP.
对于叙利亚的毁灭，世界束手旁观甚至参与其中，结果，超过 500,000人失去了生命，大部分叙利亚人被迫离开家园。	The world has done little but watch or, worse, participate in the destruction of Syria, where more than 500,000 people have lost their lives and a majority of the population has been forced to leave their homes.
健康寿命预期的增加是一个积极的发展趋势，但这一人口变化为许多已经开始失去自生能力的经济体造成了严重的威胁。	While the rise in healthy life expectancy is a positive development, this demographic shift poses a serious threat to many economies, which are already losing vitality.
事实上，尽管陆克文的澳大利亚总理生涯一点都不平坦，但他的过人智力是我在过去30年里打过交道的所有公共人物中首屈一指的。	Indeed, though Rudd’s tenure as Australia’s prime minister was anything but smooth, his sheer force of intellect is unmatched by that of any public figure with whom I have interacted over the last 30 years.
事实上，人们在国家间的迁徙早已有数千年历史了 — — 有人为了避祸，有人为了发财，有人向往自由，有人则为寻找一个新的开始。	People have migrated to other countries for thousands of years – to escape, prosper, be free, or just to start again.
格兰岱尔，加利福尼亚—作为最恪守传统的宗教之一，天主教的核心中包含着一个悖论。 这个悖论正在变得日益尖锐。	GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA – Catholicism, among the most tradition-bound religions, contains at its core a paradox that has become increasingly sharp.
通过改良种子储备和更有效的水管理，我们可以获得水需求更低的作物，以更高密度种植，并且能适应更大的温度范围。	Through improved seed stocks and more efficient water management, we can have crops that require less water, grow at higher density, and thrive in wider temperature ranges.
如果成功，或许他们应该在荣耀的绿色伊斯兰国旗周围添加一个黑色的边框 — — 不是表示哀悼的黑色，而是代表正义的黑色。	If they succeed, perhaps they should add a black border around the proud Islamic green of their flag – the black not of mourning, but of justice.
他们也许缺少迈克尔·道格拉斯（Michael Douglass）在1987年的电影《华尔街 》 （ Wall Street）中所扮演的角色直白，但他们所传递的信息是一样的 ： “ 贪婪是一件好事 。 ”	They may lack the candor of Michael Douglas’s character in the 1987 movie Wall Street, but the message hasn’t changed: “Greed is good.”
巴勒斯坦人抱怨说国际社会之所以办事不公，就是因为它们不满在巴勒斯坦领土上举行的自由和公正的选举结果。 哈马斯在这一选举中大获全胜。	Palestinians complained that the international community acted unjustly, simply because they were unhappy with the result of a free and fair election in the Palestinian territories, which Hamas won overwhelmingly.
此外，如果我们向紧急状态那样对待气候变化，在未来20年中认真地减缓变暖的速度，则牧业的影响比例会更大。	Moreover, if we treated climate change as the emergency it is and were serious about slowing the pace of warming over the next 20 years, the proportional influence of livestock farming would be even greater.
在1996-2005期间，人民币盯住美元的制度促进了通过坚定不移的改革和严格的财政纪律来实现最强劲的经济增长。	China achieved its strongest growth when the renminbi was pegged to the dollar – a system that required steadfast reforms and strict fiscal discipline.
同情等道���情感和直立行走和可弯折的大拇指一样，都是适应的不择向的作用，是物种通过特定基因的繁衍而获得的特征。	Moral emotions like empathy are as much an outcome of the blind workings of adaptation as our upright stance and opposable thumbs – traits that are entrenched in a species through the proliferation of particular genes.
民主党总统提名人希拉里·克林顿的政策平台提出了解决这些问题的新计划，并特别强调探亲假和早教和大学教育。	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s policy platform proposes new programs to address these issues, with a particular focus on family leave and early childhood and college education.
“退欧”支持者将退欧比做20世纪40年代的敦刻尔克精神 — — 一个民族独自岿然屹立、抵挡住入侵的舰队和武装，同时始终完全独立于欧洲。	The rhetoric of the “Leave” supporters conjures up the spirit of Dunkirk in 1940 – a nation standing alone, impervious to invading armadas and armies, and always fiercely independent of Europe.
换句话说，欧洲人的实践行为反映出美元作为唯一真正全球货币、被中国和全世界货币交易这和投资者无条件接受的“过度特权 ” 。	In other words, European practice reflects the dollar’s “exorbitant privilege” as the only true global currency, freely accepted by currency traders and investors in China and around the world.
而政府必须重新进行资源分配，这些资源以前被拨给了精神病院和在保持现状中拥有既得利益的官僚机构，而现在却应该拨给那些致力于社区生活的机构和组织。	And governments must reallocate resources from institutions -- and the bureaucracies that have a vested interest in preserving their positions -- to organizations that support community-based living.
大量有资格领取社会保障福利的美国老年人将在未来30年使得社会保障计划支出相对GDP的比例从当前的4.9％上升至6.3 ％ 。	The larger number of older Americans who are eligible for Social Security benefits will drive the program’s costs from 4.9% of GDP this year to 6.3% of GDP over the next 30 years.
Pourtant, aujourd’hui, les universités des États-Unis sont bien meilleures que leurs homologues européennes.	Yet today, universities in the United States easily outperform their European counterparts.
麦肯锡公司指出，到2030年，数字化有望改变四个关键行业（消费和零售、汽车和交通、医疗、及物流）并创造相当于全行业10 % - 45%的收入。	As McKinsey notes, digitization promises to shift and create value equivalent to anywhere from 10% to 45% of total industry revenues in four key sectors (consumer and retail, automotive and mobility, health care, and freight and logistics) by 2030.
与人们所设想的相反，他并没有一幅关于全世界的战略图景，这一短板可以从他一碰到反对的声音便迅速妥协一窥端倪。	Contrary to what one might think, he does not have a real strategic vision of the world – a shortcoming reflected in his quick capitulation in the face of opposition to his proposals.
由于那些赌价格会上涨并且买入的人和那些预测价格会下跌但是因为卖空代价太大而仍然坚持的人之间的不对称，泡沫进一步被吹大。	The bubble is inflated further by the asymmetry between those who bet that prices will rise and buy, and those who forecast a fall, but stay out because to sell short is too costly.
但是，资本存量相对于产出不断增加意味着不断降低的资本回报，假以时日，这将给银行部门带来更多的不良贷款。	An ever-increasing capital stock relative to output, however, means ever-lower returns to capital and thus ever more non-performing loans in the banking sector over time.
许多网站和论坛都发动类似“如果你是郭海藻，你会选择宋思明和一套房子，还是选择小贝（那个被抛弃的前男友）和真爱 ？ ”	Many Web sites and bulletin boards have run surveys with questions like, “If you were Guo Haizao, would you choose Song Siming and an apartment or Xiaobei (the dumped boyfriend) and true love?”
即使在德国选举之后，我仍不确定德国政府愿意支持意大利援助计划而不要求获得关于意大利执政联盟目标 — — 甚至其组成 — — 的重大承诺。	Even after Germany’s election, I am not sure that the government will be willing to support an Italian rescue program without asking for major guarantees concerning the objectives – and even the composition – of Italy’s ruling coalition.
而在近700所由联合国负责管理的叙利亚、加沙、西岸、黎巴嫩和约旦的学校中，近年来近半数都曾有过至少一次遇袭或关闭的经历。	And nearly half of the 700 UN-administered schools in Syria, Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Jordan have been attacked or shut down at least once in recent years.
这些目标伟大、高尚、雄心勃勃，但同时完全符合今天二百年智利的现实状况，今天的智利正以前所未有的乐观和热情准备迎接21世纪。	They are grand, noble, and ambitious goals, but fully attainable for today’s Chile, the Bicentennial Chile, a Chile now viewing the twenty-first century with more optimism and enthusiasm than ever before.
在欧洲，欧洲研究委员会(ERC)的创立正进入决定性阶段。 这对于我们准备让科学好奇心发挥怎样的作用具有至关重要的意义。	In Europe, the establishment of the European Research Council (ERC) is entering a decisive phase, with crucial implications concerning the role we are prepared to concede to scientific curiosity.
1971年8月15日，尼克松向进口货物加征10%的临时附加税，以“确保美国产品不会因不公平汇率而陷于劣势 。 ”	On August 15, 1971, Nixon imposed a temporary surcharge of 10% on imports “to ensure that American products will not be at a disadvantage because of unfair exchange rates.”
但这些目标 — — 包括改善农业，制造业和服务业的市场准入机制；厘清国际贸易规则；并在解决环境问题上取得进展 — — 有点过于雄心勃勃了。	But these objectives – including improvement of market access in agriculture, manufacturing, and services; clarification of international trade rules; and progress on addressing relevant environmental issues – were overly ambitious.
在以色列人看来，从今往后一旦涉及核武器这个议题，美国将对各国一视同仁；以方还尤为关切奥巴马可能乐于将以色列的核地位与伊朗的核野心相提并论，以此处理伊朗核问题一事。	From now on, it appeared to Israelis, the US will treat all states the same when it comes to nuclear weapons. Israel is especially concerned that Obama might be willing to address Iran’s nuclear ambition by equating it with Israel’s nuclear status.
对于共产主义的强硬派来说，他是三重英雄 — — 无论从历史学角度上，从爱国主义角度，还是从全世界的角度来说。	For hard-line Communists, he was a hero three times over – historical, patriotic, and world-class.
事实上，整个地区都弥漫着日益加深的疑虑：当外国军队离开后，阿富汗将再次陷入内战，塔利班将最终重新掌权。	Indeed, across the region, apprehension is growing that when foreign troops leave, Afghanistan will again descend into civil war, ultimately bringing the Taliban back to power.
奥巴马将在求助国会时谨言慎行，因为即使他的共和党对手投票给予有限的支持，他们也会想尽一切办法让他们的日子不好过。	Obama will tread carefully as he approaches Congress and, even as his Republican opponents vote to offer limited support, they will make his life as difficult as possible.
在美国，总统奥巴马要求国会拨款62亿美元，其中24亿美元用于降低埃博拉进入美国的风险和建立50座美国埃博拉治疗中心。	In the United States, President Barack Obama asked Congress for $6.2 billion, including $2.4 billion to reduce the risk of the disease becoming established in America and set up 50 US Ebola treatment centers.
由此导致的市场扭曲是世界渔业长期管理失调的主要因素，据世界银行估计，渔业管理失调2012年给全球经济造成83亿美元的损失。	The resulting market distortion is a major factor behind the chronic mismanagement of the world’s fisheries, which the World Bank calculates to have cost the global economy $83 billion in 2012.
特朗普已经清楚地表明，他将立刻让美国退出跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） — —这与罗斯对美国贸易协议的批评态度一致。	Trump has made it clear that he will immediately withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) – in keeping with Ross’s criticism of America’s trade deals.
他们认为响应刺激要求只能导致更多的刺激要求，形成一个彼此强化的分肥动态，一切财政整合观点都会被排除在外。	They believe that responding to calls for stimulus would simply lead to more such calls, creating a log-rolling, pork-barrel dynamic in which any hope for fiscal consolidation is ruled out.
美国为其同盟国提供的安全保障具备了可信度是因为核导弹正如约翰F·肯尼迪所期望的那样，并没有在十年之内扩展到25个国家。	The credibility of American security guarantees for its allies is one of the reasons that the bomb did not spread to 25 countries within a decade, as President John F. Kennedy once expected.
法国总统竞选中的领先竞争者Nicolas Sarkozy最近猛烈抨击被他称作“投机资本主义”的现象，并说他想要将欧元所创造的金融区“道德化 ” 。	Nicolas Sarkozy, the leading contender in the French presidential election, recently lashed out against what he called “speculative capitalism,” and says he wants to “moralize the financial zone” created by the euro.
如果从北约画出到这些国家和组织的辐射线，就可以形成拥有多个核心和集群的全球安全网络 — — 类似于一张互联网地图，或者是一张行星星系图。	If one draws links radiating outward from NATO to all of these different countries and organizations, the result is a security network that has multiple hubs and clusters – much like a map of the Internet or of planets and galaxies.
不幸的是，经济学家和其他社会科学家实际上没有受过如何在不同模型中做出选择的训练，也没有同行会赞赏他们在这方面的能力。	Unfortunately, economists and other social scientists get virtually no training in how to choose among alternative models. Neither is such an aptitude professionally rewarded.
中共害怕军阀 — — 这是1911年清朝覆灭后中国陷入分裂的关键原因 — — 如此偏向沈阳令人奇怪。	Given the CCP’s fear of warlordism – which played a key role in China’s dismemberment after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 – this imbalance in favor of Shenyang is odd.
勃兰登堡AfD领导人安德烈斯·卡尔比茨（Andreas Kalbitz）最近宣布该党计划在明年进行的三个东德州的选举中以“社会正义”为重点。	And the AfD leader in Brandenburg, Andreas Kalbitz, recently announced that the party plans to focus on “social justice” in upcoming elections in three eastern German states next year.
李家对三星电子的直接所有权只有不到5 % ， 但控制着集团实际控股公司三星物产 — — 持有三星电子4.3%的股权和三星寿险19.3%的股权 — — 31.1%的股权。	The Lee family has less than 5% direct ownership of Samsung Electronics, but holds a 31.1% stake in Samsung C&T, the group’s de facto holding company, which owns a 4.3% stake in Samsung Electronics and a 19.3% stake in Samsung Life Insurance.
但条约必须在附件中所列44个核技术持有国签署通过后才能生效，否则的话核试验的幽灵将依然萦绕在我们身边。	But, for the CTBT to enter into force, all 44 states specified as holders of nuclear technology must ratify it. Until they do, the specter of nuclear testing will continue to haunt us.
毕竟，美国颠覆过，或者至少试图颠覆过它所反对的无核政权，包括阿富汗、伊拉克、利比亚和（未获成功的）叙利亚。	The US has, after all, overthrown or at least tried to overthrow non-nuclear regimes that it opposes, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and (unsuccessfully) Syria.
周末，一份联邦调查局前局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey，特朗普炒他的鱿鱼导致了穆勒的任命）的备忘录被泄露，也引起了特朗普的愤怒。	At week’s end, a memoir by former FBI director James Comey, whose firing by Trump led to Mueller’s appointment, began to leak, also arousing Trump’s ire.
东京—10月5日，在经历了多年令人心疲力竭、事无巨细的讨价还价后，12个环太平洋国家终于签署了跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） 。 TPP协定包括了从更多贸易到更清洁的环境的一系列承诺。	TOKYO – On October 5, after years of exhausting – and exhaustive – haggling, a dozen Pacific Rim countries finally signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement that promises everything from more trade to a cleaner environment.
因特网上“开放代码”运动的发展表明：不仅是最基本的创意，就连具有巨大商业价值的产品都可以不受知识产权的保护而免费获得。	The growth of the “open source” movement on the Internet shows that not just the most basic ideas, but even products of enormous immediate commercial value can be produced without intellectual property protection.
而这正是人民银行在8月12—13日所做的，当时，比预期更大幅度的贬值压力和飙升的贬值预期导致了一个风险，即计划中的一次性汇率调整可能引发崩盘。	And this is precisely what the PBOC did on August 12-13, when stronger-than-expected depreciation pressure and surging devaluation expectations raised the risk that the planned one-off exchange-rate adjustment could trigger a rout.
基本要点在于，以两种标准算 — — 人均收入（以PPP汇率衡量）和总GDP（以市场汇率衡量 ） — —中国超越美国的时刻都在未来。	The bottom line is that, by either criterion – per capita income (at PPP exchange rates) or aggregate GDP (at market rates) – the day when China surpasses the US remains in the future.
不出意外，新自由主义者向来都绝口不提自由化的这一后果，因为他们声称 — — 或者说是撒谎 — — 所有人都会受益。	Not surprisingly, the neoliberals never advertised this consequence of trade liberalization, as they claimed – one could say lied – that all would benefit.
另外，他们还容易被犯罪团伙挟持，经过训练从事偷盗，或者在更坏的情况下任由恐怖分子摆布，执行袭击任务。	Moreover, they are prone to being kidnapped by criminal gangs, trained to steal or pickpocket, or, worse, placed at the mercy of terrorists for use in attacks.
让我们想想这个世界有多少核武器：全世界共有约16,300件，其中1,800件处于高度戒备状态，一声令下就可以发射。	Consider how many nuclear weapons there are: an estimated 16,300 around the world, with 1,800 on high alert and ready for use on short notice.
朝鲜经济现在更加开放，外贸几乎占到GDP的一半，这是金在20世纪90年代中期逐渐推进市场化进程的结果。	It is now more open, with foreign trade accounting for almost half of GDP, the result of a gradual marketization process that began in the mid-1990s.
最后一家公司是Rezz.it，主要从事规模较大而且计划好了的交易 — — 但同样关注于那些一旦有意出售的卖方无法找到有购买欲的买方，就不可能发生的交易。	Finally, there is Rezz.it, focused on larger, planned transactions – but, again, transactions that might not have happened because willing sellers would never have found eager buyers.
由麻省理工学院、德国国际和安全事务研究所（German Institute for International and Security Affairs）和其他领衔研究机构的研究者组成的小组已经制定了一些具体方案来实施这一计划。	A group of researchers representing MIT, the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, and other leading institutions, has already developed a set of concrete proposals regarding how to implement such a program.
中国国家主席习近平将这些人造岛列为其主要成就之一“我只能告诉你 ， ” 联合参谋部主管、陆军中将肯尼斯·麦肯齐（Kenneth McKenzie）最近说 ， “ 美军拥有丰富的摧毁西太平洋小岛的经验 。 ”	“I would just tell you,” joint staff director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie recently said, “the US military has had a lot of experience in the western Pacific taking down small islands.”
因此，很多全球最困难问题的解决，至少是部分解决实际就有赖于新的技术，这些技术可以让许多原有的复杂问题迎刃而解。	Thus, when we seek solutions to some of the world’s toughest problems, they, too, are likely to be found, at least in part, in new technologies that can resolve old and seemingly intractable problems.
新的金融交易税可能依然会面对来自欧洲内部（尤其是银行部门规模和影响力都相当庞大的英国）的政治阻力，但至少制定体现更高税负公平的规则已经排到了欧洲议程的前列。	The new FTT might still face political opposition in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, with its large and influential banking sector, but at least the principle of greater tax fairness is high on the European agenda.
论文作者指出尽管工业革命导致气候变化，但因为我们的祖先停止砍伐树木，煤炭应用实际对森林起到了保护作用。	Its authors point out that while the Industrial Revolution caused climate change, reliance on coal was actually good for forests, because our forebears stopped raiding forests for wood.
欧洲不愿实行再通胀政策是因为德国根深蒂固的对通胀的恐惧（这也是德国人始终致力于财政紧缩的原因 ） 。	Europe’s unwillingness to reflate reflects Germany’s deep-seated fear of inflation (which underpins its enduring commitment to austerity).
不仅如此，我们还不清楚中国预备怎样把医疗护理送到农村的艾滋病前沿，因为人民公社解体后，老的卫生防疫站体系早就随着农业集体化的崩溃不复存在了。	Moreover, it is unclear how care will be delivered to the rural front lines, where the old system of clinics based in Peoples’ Communes collapsed with the de-collectivization of agriculture.
北向喜马拉雅山南脉，东临茂密的柚木林，西南两侧则分别是孟加拉和印度洋，缅甸的历史和政治一直都被该国的地理位置所左右。	Ringed in the north by the southern ridges of the Himalayas, to the east by foothills of dense teak forests, and to the west and south by the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean, Burma’s geography has always shaped the country’s history and politics.
当然，这在很大程度上归功于中国，中国是十年来满足我增长预期的唯一一个金砖国家（巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国 ） （ 尽管印度相差也不是太多 ） 。	Of course, this is largely owing to China, the only BRIC country (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) that has met my growth expectations for the decade (although India is not too far behind).
但是，尽管出现了这些错误举措，但当全世界政府考虑如何最好地响应危机的教训时，曾经被视为问题的一部分的央行被认为是解决办法的关键部分。	Yet, despite these missteps, when governments around the world considered how best to respond to the lessons of the crisis, central banks, once seen as part of the problem, came to be viewed as an essential part of the solution.
米歇尔在这方面已经耗费了整整一年，并与其他因素一起导致了以色利的内塔尼亚胡政府和奥巴马当局之间的紧张关系。	More than a year was wasted on this, causing, among other things, tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and the Obama administration.
但直到进口开始压垮越来越多的美国工业部门并刺激产生了巨额且持续的对外贸易逆差之后，该国的贸易政策才开始变得更加富有防御性，进而与许多合作伙伴产生摩擦。	It was not until imports began to overwhelm a growing number of industries in the US, fueling the emergence of large and persistent external deficits, that the country’s trade policy became more defensive, creating friction with many of its partners.
即使中国领导人认为他们拥有必要的财政空间事实这一战略，他们也有可能因为通胀风险而不这么做。 通胀风险比其他任何经济变量更有可能导致社会动荡。	Even if China’s leaders decided that they had the necessary fiscal latitude to pursue such a strategy, they probably would not, owing to the risk of inflation, which, perhaps more than any other economic variable, tends to lead to social unrest.
最近的欧洲政坛乱象表明，不管从抽象角度看德国总理默克尔为重债外围国开出的紧缩药方是多么明智，其外表却总像是德国在颐指气使。	The current political turmoil in Europe shows that, regardless of how sensible Chancellor Angela Merkel’s austerity prescriptions for debt-ridden peripheral Europe might be in the abstract, they resemble a German Diktat.
随着借贷门槛降低，增加消费的并非富人群体，他们的支出本不受收入制约；增加消费的主要是贫穷和年轻的家庭，他们的梦想超出了他们的收入。	When borrowing becomes easier, it is not the well-to-do, whose spending is not constrained by their incomes, who increase their consumption; rather, the increase comes from poorer and younger families whose needs and dreams far outpace their incomes.
有时，两种同源体的序列一致性程度可以低至只有25—30 % ， 与此同时，它们的折叠却仍保持着极大的相似性，这证明蛋白质功能对进化是鲁棒的。	Sometimes the extent of sequence identity between two orthologs can be as low as 25-30%, and yet their folds remain strikingly similar, attesting to the robustness of function to evolutionary change.
值得赞扬的是，中国确实宣布了环境政策的重大变化 — — 一个全国性的温室气体排放限额交易系统，将于2017年生效。	To its credit, China did announce an important shift in environmental policy – a nationwide cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions, to go into effect in 2017.
但正如我们从汤玛斯·库恩（Thomas Kuhn）以及其他科学哲学家那里所认识到的那样，最主流的理论范式往往不一定是最准确的。	As we know from the work of Thomas Kuhn and other philosophers of science, dominant paradigms do not always turn out to be the most accurate.
因此尽管P5+1集团（中国、法国、俄罗斯、英国、美国，再加上德国）在哈萨克斯坦会议上已做出让步，谈判没有进展也并不出人意料。	So it was no surprise that itdid not, despite the concessions that were made at the meeting in Kazakhstan by the P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus Germany).
如果我们把行为建立在恐惧的基础上，我们就会带着狐疑的目光打量所有与我们不同的人，加深我们祖国内外数百万认为自己无法融入哪怕是最开放的社会的人的疏离感。	If our behavior is based on fear, we will look with suspicion on all those who are different from us, deepening the alienation of the millions inside and outside our countries who believe that they cannot integrate into even the most open societies.
预算没能通过的原因是极右翼的瑞典民主党（Swedish Democrats）突然决定支持中右翼联盟的方案。	Having failed to pass its first budget – owing to the abrupt decision by the far-right Swedish Democrats (SD) to support the Alliance alternative – the government could not simply continue as if nothing had happened.
但正如前总统卡姆莱马·莫特兰特（Kgalema Motlanthe）主持的高级别小组最近所主张的那样，还需要一系列配套措施来支持年轻人和其他弱势求职者的就业。	But, as the high-level panel chaired by former President Kgalema Motlanthe has recently argued, complementary measures are needed to support employment of young people and other vulnerable job seekers.
不久前他刚刚批准投入巨资兴建基础设施，其中包括一座臭名昭著的通往阿拉斯加偏远地区的大桥，作为对其政治支持者们的一项回报。	He recently signed a lavish infrastructure bill that included, among other payoffs to political supporters, an infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska.
4月，西班牙警方对前国际货币基金组织（IMF）总裁罗德里格·拉托（Rodrigo Rato）提起腐败调查质询。	In April, Spanish police questioned Rodrigo Rato, a former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, as part of a corruption probe.
我们还应该停止用手段混淆目的：比如，管理良好的自由贸易可能带来更大的共同繁荣；但如果得不到良好的管理，它就将降低许多 — — 也许是大部分 — — 公民的生活水平。	And we should stop confusing ends with means: for example, free trade, if well managed, might bring greater shared prosperity; but if it is not well managed, it will lower the living standards of many – possibly a majority – of citizens.
这项工程共动用了6533门高炮，5939个火箭发射架以及许多架次的飞机来播撒干冰，液态氮和碘化银，好让覆盖中国大陆1/3面积的云团洒下雨来。	Such efforts, Zheng reports, have involved some 6,533 cannons, 5,939 rocket launchers, and numerous aircraft in an attempt to seed clouds across one-third of China’s landmass with dry ice, ammonia, and silver iodide.
如果发展中国家戒烟人口的比例从当今的5%不到提高到2020年的40 % ( 正如加拿大目前的戒烟率 ) ， 那么，在2050年以前就可以避免大约一亿五千万到一亿八千万人死于吸烟。	About 150-180 million tobacco deaths would be avoided before 2050 if the proportion of adults in developing countries who quit smoking increases from below 5% today to 30-40% by 2020 (like current quit rates in Canada).
如此，特朗普就能在国内宣称取得胜利，同时让欧洲消费者摆脱欧盟农业保护主义的束缚，提高欧洲人民的生活水平。	This would enable Trump to proclaim victory at home, while raising the European standard of living by freeing Europe’s consumers from the yoke of the EU’s agricultural protectionism.
他用在线绘图工具绘制了他所居住的姆班达卡（Mbandaka）村的首张地图，他和他的妻子2009年来已经对这张图修改超过100,000次。	Using online mapmaking tools, he created the first map of his village, Mbandaka, which he and his wife have modified more than 100,000 times since 2009.
但如果它能设法解决其中最为紧迫的问题 — — 下行通货紧缩风险 — — 其备受争议的债务挑战就将变得更加易于管理。	But if it manages to address the most urgent among them – downside deflationary risks – its much-discussed debt challenge will become far more manageable.
我本人关于今天的停滞的理论关注人们对技术的迅速进步的焦虑。 技术的迅速进步可能最终取代大量乃至大部分工作岗位，造成巨大的经济不平等。	My own theory about today’s stagnation focuses on growing angst about rapid advances in technologies that could eventually replace many or most of our jobs, possibly fueling massive economic inequality.
但格里萨的裁决基于对阿根廷合同的某些条款的特殊解读 — — 在我们看来，这样的解读根本站不住脚 — — 这表明美国的商业利益可能左右法院判决。	But Griesa's ruling, based on a peculiar – and in our view, indefensible – interpretation of certain terms in Argentina's contract, showed that US commercial interests can dominate its courts' decisions.
所幸中国的家庭和国企创造了庞大的储蓄，才使中国经济得以承受权贵资本主义造成的资源巨大浪费和扭曲配置。	And, thanks to the large pool of savings generated by Chinese households and state-owned companies, the Chinese economy can for the time being bear the waste and misallocation implied by such crony capitalism.
反对派活动份子被阻止进行大部分的竞选活动，他们经常被捕，而克里姆林宫控制的法院不受理他们的抗议申请。	Opposition activists were blocked from most campaigning, and often arrested, while Kremlin-controlled courts denied their complaints.
尽管制裁能够提高制造核武器的成本，但历史表明，如果政府对于拥有核武器足够重视，就愿意承担高昂的代价。	Although sanctions may increase the cost of producing nuclear weapons, history suggests that governments are willing to pay a significant price if they place a high enough value on having them.
多年来，一直由美元充当着这一角色（从某种程度上说也包括某些其他国家的货币 ） ， 这引发了诸多关于美国拥有“过分特权”的抱怨。	For years, the pragmatic answer has been the dollar, and to some extent other national currencies, giving rise to complaints of an “inordinate privilege” for the US.
关键在于争论双方都更加明确他们认为社会应该追求怎样的价值观和目标，并对他们关于动态表现如何响应特定的激励的假设进行量化。	The key is for participants on both sides to be more explicit about the values and objectives they believe that society should pursue, and to quantify their assumptions about how dynamic performance will respond to particular incentives.
伊朗与英国和美国的冲突是一个含义更加广泛的局面的一部分，即19和20世纪期间西方利用其军事和经济主导力将其实力和政治意愿凌驾于世界大部之上。	Iran’s confrontation with the UK and the US is part of the much broader saga of the West’s use of its military and economic dominance to project its power and political will over much of the world during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
赫希曼指出当一条车道开始移动时，另一条车道上的人会“感觉好多了 ” ， 因为他们感觉自己很快也能向前开一点。	Hirschman argued that when one lane of cars begins moving, people in the other lane “feel much better off,” because they expect to move soon, too.
在政府强制基金经理参与拍卖之前，市场竞争几乎非常微弱（调查结果显示大多数人并不清楚支付了多少费用 ） 。	Until the government forced fund managers to participate in auctions, there was little market competition (surveys reveal that most people are not aware of the fees they pay).
（相反，他们在第二轮选举开始前就被一场军事政变所粉碎，由此引发八年的残酷内战导致约200,000人丧生。 ）	(Instead, they were crushed by a military coup, before a second round of elections could take place, triggering a brutal eight-year civil war in which an estimated 200,000 people died.)
今年8月，在怀俄明州杰克森霍尔（Jackson Hole）举行的央行高官年度会议上，他又投下了第二颗重磅炸弹。	This August, he used the annual gathering of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to drop another bomb.
但2008—2009年金融危机所造成的混乱，以及随后所采取的紧缩措施，破坏了作为欧盟立盟之基的承诺，也让有毒意识形态死灰复燃。	But the disarray produced by the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and the austerity measures that followed, undermined the EU’s foundational promises and paved the way for the return of toxic ideologies.
教育也越来越在线化了，很快，各地的学生就能以几乎为零的（增加学生人数的 ） “ 边际成本”获得一流的教学服务。	Education is increasingly online as well, and will soon enable students everywhere to receive first-rate instruction at almost a zero “marginal” cost for enrolling another student.
但是现在局势飘忽不定，自助还是不足。 现在需要各国政府和中央银行动手，因为只有它们才规模足够庞大，行动足够迅速。	But in a climate of profound uncertainty, self-help is not enough. Governments or central banks are needed, because only they are both big and quick enough.
如果全球经济继续沿着当前轨迹运行下去，那么一段时间的剧烈波动可能动摇许多新兴经济体，也破坏全球发展努力。	If the global economy remains on its current trajectory, a period of intense volatility could destabilize a number of emerging economies, while undermining development efforts worldwide.
事实上，以色列对特朗普的支持率在特朗普决定退出JCPOA、以色列对在叙利亚的伊朗目标进行大规模军事打击后达到了历史新高。	In fact, support for Trump in Israel reached a record high after his decision to withdraw from the JCPOA, and following Israel’s massive military strike against Iranian targets in Syria.
与此同时，希腊要保证这些改革不会伤害最贫困人群，这可以听过引入积极的劳动力市场政策实现（如培训补贴和雇用长期失业者 ） 。	At the same time, Greece would ensure that these reforms do not hurt the poorest by introducing active labor-market policies (such as subsidies to train and hire the long-term unemployed).
这在今天尤其重要，如果美国没有成为两国制的热情支持者，它就会落后于形势的发展，并损害其自身在中东的利益。	This has never been more true than today, and if America is not seen as an avid supporter of a two-state solution, it will stay well behind the curve and damage its own interests in the Middle East.
迄今为止，美国人都能在很大程度上容忍 — — 甚至称赞 — — 与商业创新相关的创造性破坏，并在限制潜在的滥用行为时保持谨慎。	So far, Americans have largely tolerated – and even applauded – the creative destruction associated with business innovation, and have been cautious in limiting potential abuses.
另外，烟草工业通过诡计，以巨额的资金支持发动长期的、处心积虑的假信息攻势，也在环境癌症风险方面混淆视听。	Moreover, confusion about environmental cancer risks also results from longstanding, carefully cultivated, and well-financed disinformation campaigns inspired by the machinations of the tobacco industry.
已故经济学家、欧洲央行行长夏欧帕（Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa）曾说，撒切尔“移走了分割市场和政府的界线，扩大了前者的地盘，缩小了后者的地盘 。 ”	As the late economist and European central banker Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa once put it, Thatcher “shifted the line dividing markets from government, enlarging the territory of the former at the expense of the latter.”
尽管如此 — — 或者，正因为他蔑视任何形式的多边主义 — — 美国总统特朗普称之为“有史以来最愚蠢的协议 ” ， 并预言它将“导致核毁灭 ” 。	Despite that – or, perhaps, because of his disregard for multilateralism in all forms – US President Donald Trump has called it the “stupidest deal of all time,” and predicted that it would “lead to a nuclear holocaust.”
平心而论，一些改革 — — 包括税收、监管和卫生方面的措施 — — 有助于在不给公共部门带来额外高成本的 同时重新实现平衡。	To be fair, some reforms – including tax, regulatory, and health-care measures – will help to restore balance without imposing large additional costs on the public sector.
比如，对西班牙而言，在建设共同欧洲能源市场方面，法国的合作至关重要；事实上，这一关系能够为法国和全欧洲带来巨大的好处。	For example, France’s cooperation on the construction of a common European market for energy is crucial for Spain; indeed, this relationship could be enormously beneficial both for France and all of Europe.
虽然有必要认识到设定通货目标的优点，但在评估我们自身经济状况以及政策的成败方面，痛苦指数也是有一定作用的。	While it is important to recognize the merits of inflation targeting, the misery index, too, has a role to play in helping us to assess the state of our economies – and the success of our policies.
纽约—我是宏观经济学家，但我不同意美国最主要的两个宏观经济学阵营：专注于提振总需求的新凯恩斯主义和专注于减税的供给学派。	NEW YORK – I am a macroeconomist, but I dissent from the profession’s two leading camps in the United States: the neo-Keynesians, who focus on boosting aggregate demand, and the supply-siders, who focus on cutting taxes.
近几周来，伊朗货币里亚尔贬值了约40 % ， 极大地增加了伊朗的通货膨胀率和伊朗的进口品和原材料价格。	Iran’s currency, the rial, has fallen roughly 40% in recent weeks, sharply increasing Iran’s inflation rate and what Iranians must pay for imports and many staples.
因此，难怪被视为中国人民银行行长潜在的继任者—周小川(他本人同时也是很有影响力的银行家)曾提出警告：有可能会出现中国式的次贷危机。	No wonder, then, that one influential banker regarded as a possible successor to PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has warned of the possibility of a “Chinese-style subprime crisis.”
因此，在对妇女的作用持现代看法的富裕发达社会中，生育率总是会低于替代率也是是不可避免的，总体而言也是值得欢迎的。	In rich developed societies with modern attitudes to the role of women, fertility rates somewhat below replacement levels may thus be both inevitable and broadly welcome.
其中一种并不自然携带沃尔巴克氏菌的蚊子是伊蚊，但这种蚊子会传播包括登革热，奇昆古尼亚热病，黄热病，和寨卡在内的人类病毒。	One species where Wolbachia is not present naturally is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is responsible for transmitting human viruses like dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika.
香港 - - 《芝麻街》青蛙科米（Kermit the Frog）曾经哀叹 ， “ 生而绿，大不易 。 ”	HONG KONG – Sesame Street’s Kermit the Frog once lamented that “it’s not easy bein’ green.”
许多国家需要资金支持这些计划的实施，令人鼓舞的是，2015年巴黎气候协定成立了一个工作组解决气候相关的流离失所问题。	Many countries will need funding to implement such plans, and, encouragingly, the 2015 Paris climate agreement established a taskforce to address climate-related displacement.
如果商业情况良好，大家会一致支持将自由资本主义当作是政体的核心经济原则，金融市场可以得到发展，从而不愿承担司法系统组织所带来的风险。	If business conditions are auspicious and there is a strong consensus in favor of liberal capitalism as the polity’s core economic principle, financial markets can develop and reluctantly absorb risks stemming from the legal system’s defects.
大部分“退欧派”选民的感觉并没有转坏 （ “ 理性地”看，理应转坏才对 ） ， 反而认为境况会有所好转。	Instead of feeling worse off (as “rationally” they should), most “Leave” voters believe they will be better off.
而信贷渠道同样不甚通畅，因为银行已经囤积了来自量化宽松的大部分额外流动性，不但没有增加贷款，反而还产生了多余的储备。	The credit channel also is not working properly, as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from QE, creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending.
原子能-曾被认为是针对世界石油资源耗尽的主要技术防波堤-突然间受到了怀疑。 石油价格在年底再次翻番。	With nuclear power - regarded as the main technological bulwark against depletion of the world's oil supplies - suddenly suspect, oil prices doubled again by the year's end.
在美国，白人越来越认定自己将成为少数民族 — — 预计将在2045年实现的里程碑式事件 — — 并将此视为一种存续性威胁，并且往往表现得好像自己就是一个弱势群体。	In the United States, white people increasingly view the prospect that they will become a minority – a milestone expected to be reached in 2045 – as an existential threat, and often act as if they are a disadvantaged group.
事实上，随着成员国的国内政治在驾驭欧盟现行政策动向方面扮演了比欧洲理事会更重要的角色，即便实现一个跨政府形式的欧盟都比较渺茫。	In fact, with member states’ domestic politics playing a more important role than the European Council in driving whatever EU policy momentum exists, even an intergovernmental EU may be too much to hope for.
佛罗伦萨 — — 我们都认识历次银行大危机的一个产物：痛苦而长期的经济干扰；但它们的另一些产物却出人意料。	FLORENCE – Severe banking crises bring painful and long-lasting disruptions. But they also lead to surprises.
它提供的电费要低于客户用燃油照明的成本，目前为肯尼亚、乌干达和坦桑尼亚的330,000多户低收入家庭提供太阳能电力。	By delivering electricity at lower prices than their customers would otherwise have to pay for kerosene lighting, M-KOPA has delivered solar power to more than 330,000 low-income households in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.
比如在选举后危机的威胁下，伊朗最初同意在日内瓦提出的 10 月 1 号方案，允许将伊朗拥有的铀在第三国进行受监控的浓缩。	Thus, initially intimidated by the post-election crisis, the regime acceded to the October 1 proposal in Geneva that would have allowed the controlled enrichment of Iran’s uranium outside the country.
Tout comme en Europe, la révolution industrielle en Chine et en Inde crée une nouvelle classe moyenne ambitieuse, désireuse et capable d’envoyer ses enfants à l’université.	Just as in Europe, the industrial revolution in “Chindia” is also creating an ambitious new middle class that is willing and able to send its children to university.
麦肯锡全球研究院调研了包括煤炭，钢铁，自动制造业和零售业在内的2000多家中国企业，并认为到2030年有机会将生产效率提升20~100 ％ 。	When the McKinsey Global Institute analyzed more than 2,000 Chinese companies in industries ranging from coal and steel to auto manufacturing and retail, it found opportunities to raise productivity by 20-100% by 2030.
可以想见，一位对公司税改革的经济学和政治学有着深刻理解的政治老手总统，会力推国会通过有意义的改革方案。	A politically astute president who understood deeply the economics and politics of corporate tax reform could conceivably muscle Congress toward a reform package that made sense.
但是，如果特朗普沿着保护主义的道路继续走下去，美国贸易伙伴会发动报复，通常是采取直接针对其票仓的手段，比如，欧盟最近威胁要对肯塔基波旁酒征收关税。	If Trump goes down the protectionist road, however, US trade partners will retaliate, often with measures targeted directly at his base, as when the European Union recently threatened tariffs against Kentucky bourbon.
与此同时，头脑比较冷静的人会尽力推迟2007年对石油富城基尔库克最终态势的公民投票，因为这样的投票可能导致分裂。	At the same time, cooler heads will struggle to postpone a potentially divisive 2007 referendum on the final status of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.
如果允许医生、计算机专家或者工程师（更不用提众所周知的波兰管道工！ ）自由流动，人才汇集于最富有国家几乎肯定将增加。	If doctors, computer specialists, or engineers (let alone the proverbial Polish plumbers!) were allowed to move freely, the concentration of talent in the richest countries would most likely increase.
美国还必须处理可能出现的腐败现象，如转移Teamster公司的退休金资源是非法的，而制药公司的游说议员向彬彬有礼的国会成员提供活动捐款是合法的。	America must also deal with the potential for corruption, both illegal in the case of the diversion of Teamsters’ pension resources and legal in the campaign contributions provided by the pharmaceutical lobby to complaisant members of Congress.
他显然没有注意到与他共同获得诺贝尔奖的联合国政府间气候变化专家小组的发现，他们得出结论本世纪海平面的上升幅度只会在半英尺到两英尺左右，而他们预计最后的幅度应该在一英尺左右。	He ignores the findings of his Nobel co-winners, the IPCC, who conclude that sea levels will rise between only a half-foot and two feet over this century, with their best expectation being about one foot.
以智商和情商为代表的评估个人能力的现有范例均无法有效评估人能否与日渐壮大的“机器领”劳动大军相抗衡。	Neither of the existing paradigms for assessing individual potential – intelligence quotient and emotional quotient – can assess a person’s ability to compete against the growing “robo-collar” workforce.
马德里—1996年，内塔尼亚胡发动大量选民反对时任总理佩雷斯的传闻的“耶路撒冷分治”意图，并凭此赢得大选。	MADRID – Back in 1996, Binyamin Netanyahu won a general election by mobilizing large constituencies against then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres’s alleged intention to “divide Jerusalem.”
其次，投资者可能记得，在2008年的金融恐慌中，处于震中的美元由于恐慌影响覆盖面非常广，反而有所升值。	Second, investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic, the consequences radiated so widely that, paradoxically, the dollar actually rose in value.
身为全球公民，保护人类生命 — — 即使在战争和灾难等极端条件下 — — 一也应当成为我们所关注的任务。	The protection of human life – even in the midst of war and disasters – should be a concern for all of us, as global citizens.
这里的要害是，根据法律，美国银行的担保海外分支必须遵守许多美国规则，包括关于经营、透明度和清算（衍生品如何实际交易）的规则。	The trick here is that a de jure guaranteed foreign subsidiary of a US bank would have to comply with many US rules, including those governing conduct, transparency, and clearing (how the derivatives are actually traded).
执政的日本民主党目前身陷首相菅直人与政治掮客小泽一郎权力斗争的事实表明严肃的经济改革并不是民主党眼中的头等大事。	That the ruling Democratic Party of Japan now seems trapped in a power struggle between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and party power broker Ichiro Ozawa suggests that serious economic reform is not at the top of the DPJ agenda.
IFO经济景气指数已经存在了半个世纪，据路透社的一项民意调查，它是欧洲最著名的经济指标，甚至超过了欧盟官方的指标。	It has been produced for half a century, and, according to a poll conducted by Reuters, it is Europe’s most prominent business indicator, outperforming even official EU indicators.
十年期美国国债的实际利率（基于美国财政部的抗通胀债券）已经从2016年的零涨到了一年前的0.4 ％ ， 再到如今的0.8 ％ 。	The real rate on the ten-year US Treasury bond (based on the Treasury’s inflation-protected bonds) has gone from zero in 2016 to 0.4% a year ago to 0.8% now.
摩洛哥的妇女运动在世俗教和宗教团体之间架设了一座桥梁，为在传统社会中发挥社会思潮的力量设立了一个榜样。	The women’s movement in Morocco – which now bridges secular and religious communities – is setting an example of the power of social thought in a traditional society.
在芬兰，20世纪90年代初我们的援助减少了62 % ， 芬兰人到现在仍将这一时期称之为“经济萧条期 ” 。	Here in Finland, our aid decreased by 62% in the early 1990’s, a period that Finns still call “The Depression.”
投资者信心正在进一步修复，比如最近发行的100亿欧元（折合138亿美元）十年期西班牙政府债券就得到了4倍的超额认购。	Investor confidence is on the mend, exemplified by the recent placement of €10 billion ($13.8 billion) in ten-year government bonds – which was over-subscribed by four times.
但很难相信特朗普，或米勒和班农这样的特朗普的智囊，有兴趣扩大民主权利，即使他们假装在为普通 — — 或者用他们喜欢的用词 — — “真正的”人民说话。	But it is hard to believe that Trump, or his ideologues, like Miller or Bannon, are interested in expanding democratic rights, even though they pretend to speak for the common – or as they like to say – “real” people.
第一个假设是贸易的收益天然能够被大部分人所分享，或者直接得到，或者通过增长加快的经济体的合理再分配政策获得。	The first assumption was that the benefits of trade would naturally be shared by most of the population, either directly or because of appropriate redistribution policies implemented in the now-faster growing economies.
他对解决方法的评估也同样简单明了 ： “ 真实公正的和平及终止军备竞赛与美国及其盟国和苏联及其盟国双方的深层次利益相互吻合 。 ”	And his assessment of its solvability was equally concise: “[B]oth the United States and its allies, and the Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race.”
事实上，幸运地获得世界储备货币发行权的政府能够实现这一目标而不必让未来纳税人背上过度沉重的债务负担。	Indeed, those governments lucky enough to issue the world’s reserve currencies are able to take on this role without overloading future taxpayers with inordinate debt burdens.
1999年成为尼日利亚第一位民选总统的奥巴桑乔在近二十年的军事独裁统治后，于去年将一个为贫所困的国家交给了Yar’Adua。	Olusegun Obasanjo, who became Nigeria’s first elected president in 1999 after nearly two decades of military dictatorship, left vast swathes of the country trapped in poverty when he handed power to Yar’Adua last year.
更直接的后果是如果加沙家庭的生活继续窘迫下去，那么爆发跨边界暴力，甚至是第三次就地起义都只是一个时间问题。	More immediately, if Gazan families are not well fed, the recurrence of cross-border violence, if not the eruption of a third intifada, will only be a matter of time.
对于那些经济健全的汇率机制成员国，市场也会检验其政策制定者的决心，尤其是在突发重大事件或是大选之时。	Markets also tested the resolve of policymakers in otherwise sound ERM countries, particularly when there were big strikes or important elections.
在仅仅一年内，欧元区国家政府的普通债务就上升了大约10 % （ 从2008年的占GDP69.3%上升到2009年的78.7 % ） 。	Within a single year, eurozone governments’ general debt increased by almost 10 percentage points (78.7% of GDP in 2009, compared with 69.3% in 2008).
而这种逻辑跳跃似乎在6月召开的峰会上得到了更多信任，在那次峰会上金正恩重申“他坚定不移地致力于实现朝鲜半岛的无核化 。 ”	And this leap of logic seemed to gain more credence at the summit in June, where Kim “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
在最近的埃塞俄比亚亚的斯亚贝巴非洲经济会议上，领导人承诺继续将治理改革列为非洲日程的重中之重，但他们并没有给出路线图。	Although leaders at a recent African Economic Conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, committed to keeping governance reforms at the top of Africa’s agenda, they offered no blueprint.
但是，尽管背负债务或许是罪恶的，但《马太福音》6:12节支持赦免 ： “ 原谅我们的债务，正如我们也原谅了我们的债务人 。 ”	But, though it might be sinful to go into debt, Matthew 6:12 supports absolution: “forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.”
但这种“占据经济制高点”的模式由于其严重表现不佳而遭到了摈弃，尤其当国有企业在竞争中受到保护时（这已经成为常态 ） 。	This “commanding heights of the economy” model was rejected largely because it seriously under-performed, especially when state-owned sectors were protected from competition (as was the norm).
而齐亚哈克的去世为巴基斯坦人迎来了另一位民选非军人总理：扎比卡尔·阿里的女儿贝纳齐尔·布托（Benazir Bhutto ） ， 也是众多穆斯林人口占多数国家中的第一位女性最高领导人。	Zia’s death brought to power another democratically elected civilian prime minister: Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of Zulfikar Ali and the first woman to lead a Muslim-majority country.
但是，由于这类罚款具有不确定性，银行和银行高管很难预测它的发生，因此它对长期组织激励的影响尚不清楚。	But, because such fines are erratic and difficult for banks and banking executives to predict, their impact on long-term organizational incentives is unclear.
类似地，俄罗斯也是一个狭隘的经济体，执政的政府专注于保把持国内权力和重建俄罗斯在中东和欧洲的影响力。	Likewise, Russia is a country with a narrowly-based economy led by a government focused on retaining power at home and re-establishing Russian influence in the Middle East and Europe.
这种行为可以量化为网络的“集聚系数 ” （ clustering coefficient ） — —即某人的朋友们彼此也是朋友的概率 — — 并且不同都市区之间保持不同寻常的稳定性。	This behavior is quantified as the networks’ “clustering coefficient” – that is, the probability that a person’s friends will also be friends with one another – and remains extraordinarily stable across metropolitan areas.
无论那个触发因素是什么，对美国的影响都可能相当严重，原因很简单：美国政府继续推行顺周期财政、宏观审慎以及平稳货币政策。	Whatever the immediate trigger, the consequences for the US are likely to be severe, for a simple reason: the US government continues to pursue pro-cyclical fiscal, macro-prudential, and even monetary policies.
最后，应该成立地区性论坛更好地约束军事部署，包括采取增强信心的措施以降低军事事件风险以及在军事事件发生时有助于管理。	Finally, a regional forum should be established to regulate better the deployment of military force, including confidence-building measures to reduce the risk of incidents and to help manage them if they occur.
美国的国际竞争力正在衰退，穷人则受到忽视 — — 五分之一的美国儿童陷于贫困 — — 而且给年轻人留下堆积如山的债务。	America is losing its international competitiveness, neglecting its poor – one in five American children is trapped in poverty – and leaving a mountain of debt to its young.
2012年，国防部光是在电子工程 和计算机科学领域就投资了13亿美元，而美国科学基金会（National Science Foundation）也投资了9亿美元。	In 2012, the defense department invested $1.3 billion in electrical engineering and computer science alone, while the National Science Foundation invested another $900 million.
自然生态系统生产的商品即原材料，服务即保持大气中的氧气、传粉植物、清洁的空气和水，甚至为我们提供美感和志向。	Our natural ecosystems produce goods in the form of raw materials and services such as maintaining oxygen in the atmosphere, pollinating plants, cleaning air and water, and even providing us with beauty and inspiration.
毕竟中国不仅是阿富汗的邻国，还是全世界最重要的新兴势力 — — 事实上正如美国参谋长联席会议主席迈克·马伦在7月访问北京时所说那样，是一个“世界大国 ” 。	After all, China is not merely a neighbor of Afghanistan, but the world’s most important rising power – indeed, a “world power,” as Mike Mullen, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff proclaimed in Beijing this past June.
去年，东盟+3建立了一个区域监察机构 — — 东盟+3宏观经济研究室 — — 来监测区域经济，探测新出现的脆弱节点，并为协议的有效决策提供支持。	Last year, ASEAN+3 established a regional surveillance unit, the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), to monitor regional economies, detect emerging vulnerabilities, and support effective decision-making by the CMIM.
心存疑虑的领导人会从政治上最方便的项目开始，而激进的领导人会从最有挑战性的内容开始；但哪种方法能产生预期效果，谁也打不了包票。	Apprehensive leaders start with the most politically expedient items, while bold leaders start with the most challenging prescriptions; but there is no guarantee that either of these approaches will deliver the expected result.
此外，由于人们对法国竞争力日程抱有极高期望，因此我们必须确保加快实施国民公约，从而在2013年就开始收获成效。	And, because expectations for France’s competitiveness agenda are high, we will ensure swift implementation of the National Pact so that it can start producing results as soon as 2013.
事实上，有些人已经开始质疑由掌握市场份额的少数几家大型企业搜集和控制海量数据是否会给可能进入的创新者带来无法逾越的进入障碍，并因此违反竞争原则。	Indeed, some have begun to ask whether the collection and control of large amounts of data by a few huge firms with commanding market shares can be an anticompetitive force, creating insurmountable entry barriers for would-be innovators.
但如今对自由的高谈阔论却难以掩盖这场人民“革命”最终演变成一场军事接管的事实，数十年的紧急状态法依然有效，而国家的政治方向却难以捉摸。	Yet today’s heady talk of freedom cannot obscure the reality that the people’s “revolution” has so far led only to a direct military takeover, with the decades-old emergency law still in force and the country’s political direction uncertain.
如果协议失败，德国可能会举行新一轮选举 — — 这显然是一个风险很大的选择，因为近期民意调查显示选择党可能借此赢得更多选票，而基民盟和社民党的支持可能会下降。	If the agreement fails, Germany might hold a fresh election – a risky option, to be sure, as recent polls indicate that the AfD could win an even larger share of the vote, while support for the CDU and the SPD could decline.
此外，尽管土耳其同意北约在其国内部署反导弹雷达系统，最近还扣留了一艘叙利亚注册的武装船只，这可能会取悦西方，但在这些事件中，土耳其的政策仍以“硬”军力为焦点。	And, while Turkey’s agreement to host NATO anti-missile radar facilities, and its recent seizure of a Syrian-registered arms ship, may please the West, here, too, its policies are focused on “hard” military power.
与NCD有关的大部分健康问题 — — 慢性病痛、睡眠不规律、压抑、残疾和过早死亡 — — 大多与晚期或复杂病症，而不是早期和非复杂病症有关。	Most health problems linked to NCDs – problems such as chronic pain, disordered sleep, depression, disability, and premature death – are associated with late-stage or complicated disease, rather than with early-stage or uncomplicated disease.
根据这一逻辑，2009年出生的女性的平均寿命预期应该已经超过88年；但目前的人口测算认为，2060年前出生的新生儿都无法得到这一平均寿命预期。	By this logic, a woman born in 2009 should have already had an average life expectancy of more than 88 years; but current population estimates do not foresee that average life expectancy for newborns until 2060.
他出演自己亲自作词的流行音乐电视 — — 他最著名的作品是《爱情充电器 》 （ Love Charger ） ， 还有一部描写他本人的故事片《MSG：神的信使 》 （ MSG: The Messenger of God ） 。	He performed in popular music videos of his own composition – his biggest hit is called “Love Charger” – and had a feature film made about himself called MSG: The Messenger of God.
但生活在大城市地区之外的年纪教长的人反而支持竖起藩篱并 — — 在相当大的程度上 — — 尝试将英国与世界其他部分隔离。	But older people, living outside large urban areas, have voted instead to build barriers and – to a significant extent – attempt to close off the country from the rest of the world.
传统规则制度彻底被战争羞辱，合法性的真空被强大的煽动者和民粹主义独裁填补 ： “ 最好的人没人信，最坏的人充满激情 。 ”	With the traditional institutions of rule thoroughly discredited by the war, the vacuum of legitimacy would be filled by powerful demagogues and populist dictatorships: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst/are full of passionate intensity.”
这样我们才能更好的了解她们，而不是把时间都浪费在聒噪地争论这些女性，以及千千万万个同她们一样卓有成就的穆斯林女性应该如何穿着上。	We would do better to find out more about them than to waste our time on superficial debates about how they – and many others who are just as accomplished – should dress.
取消国家主席任期限制为习近平主席和王岐山副主席实现这一长期愿景铺平了道路，从而提高了中国未来发展取得成功的机率。	By removing the presidential term limit, China’s leadership is improving its chances of success, by opening the way for Xi and his vice president, Wang Qishan, to go further in realizing this vision.
通过揭示传统风险评估方法所不能揭示的弱点，我们可以让结构性改革、行为改变和增加韧性要求的战略投资更精确。	By revealing underlying weaknesses that more traditional risk-assessment methods may miss, we could pinpoint the structural reforms, behavioral changes, and strategic investments that increased resilience requires.
首先，无论在弗拉基米尔·普金和德米特里·梅德维杰夫治下的新俄罗斯行事多么蛮横，苏联已经不复存在，也不再构成对欧美的共同威胁，这种威胁直到1989年都把欧美黏在一起。	First, whatever the brutal style of the new Russia under Vladimir Putin and Dmitri Medvedev, the Soviet Union no longer exists and no longer constitutes the common threat that was the “glue” of the Alliance until 1989.
而且50多万人丧生1000万人流离失所的叙利亚也暴露了人们大肆吹捧的“保护责任 ” （ responsibility to protect）原则的缺陷。	And, with more than 500,000 dead and another ten million displaced in Syria, the much-vaunted doctrine of the “responsibility to protect” (R2P) has been exposed as well.
我们利用一个涵盖占全球GDP三成左右的20,000家上市公司的数据库，研究符合四大创新“原型 ” — —专注客户、效率驱动、基于工程和基于科学 — — 的产业的全球收入。	Using a database of 20,000 public companies representing about 30% of global GDP, we looked at global revenue in industries that fit four innovative “archetypes”: customer-focused, efficiency-driven, engineering-based, and science-based.
至于伊朗伊斯兰共和国，继任总统哈桑·鲁哈尼或许愿意就核野心问题与世界其他国家达成协议 — — 又或许他不愿意。	As for the Islamic Republic, incoming President Hassan Rowhani may want to reach an agreement with the world on the country’s nuclear ambition – or he may not.
由于国际货币基金组织寻求服务于全球成员，因此这对于它而言尤其如此，而且还引发了有关该基金战略方向的极为重要的讨论。	This has been particularly true of the IMF as it seeks to serve its global membership, and it has triggered a critically important discussion of the Fund’s strategic direction.
这些缺陷在社会丛林计划（Socio Bosque Program）中尽显无疑。 社会丛林计划是REDD+的一个厄瓜多尔项目，它着眼于控制森林社区和农民耕作，却忽略了工业活动带来的远远更加巨大的潜在伤害。	These shortcomings are exemplified in the Socio Bosque Program, a REDD+ initiative in Ecuador, in which efforts to control forest communities and peasant farming overlook the far larger potential damage caused by industrial activity.
事实上，英国选民多数支持人口自由流动，前提是自由流动不被宣传为外国官僚机构强加的反民主政治条件，而是被作为英国和欧盟民众共同享有的一种权利。	In fact, British voters mostly support free movement, if it is presented not as an anti-democratic imposition by foreign bureaucrats, but rather as a right that British and EU citizens reciprocally enjoy.
周因为手持中华民国国旗拍照而在华遭到攻击，而她为此事在YouTube上发布的公开道歉提醒了岛上很多人中国愿意在多大程度上迫使人保持沉默。	Chou came under fire in China after posing for a picture while holding the Taiwanese flag, and her public apology for doing so – made on YouTube – reminded many on the island of the degree to which China is willing to pressure people into silence.
于是，个人和企业能够通过将钱从常规银行账户，以类同于他们今天缴税的方式，转移到TFN连接账户，增加其信用。	Individuals and firms will then be able to add credit to their TFN-linked account by transferring money from their normal bank account, in the same way that they do today to pay their taxes.
过度的社会福利开支（主要是公共养老金）和偿付国债的费用将资源从高效的政府开支领域抽走，形成了高额的税收负担。	Excessive social welfare spending (mainly public pensions) and the cost of servicing the public debt drain resources from more productive government spending and impose a high tax burden.
在经历了几十年的僵局和困境后，也许如今它可以较少地顾忌自身的生存，更多地专注于帮助实现正义持久的和平了。	After decades of standoffs and stalemate, perhaps it can focus less on its own survival and more on helping to achieve a just and lasting peace.
但是，尽管存在这些问题，能源和电力改革以及由此带来的与美国和加拿大关系的深化有利于加快墨西哥经济增长，提振就业和收入，从而提高墨西哥人民的生活水平。	But, despite such problems, the energy and electricity reforms, and the deeper links with the US and Canada that they imply, promises to accelerate Mexico’s growth rate, boost employment and income, and thus raise Mexicans’ standard of living.
在担任古吉拉特邦首席部长期间，莫迪致力于鼓励外国投资、提供24小时供电、建设公路并着手进行智能城市规划。	As Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi worked to encourage foreign investment, provide around-the-clock electricity, build roads, and engage in intelligent urban planning.
在关于中美联合研究项目中，朱将清洁能源说成“我们这个时代中美合作关系中最大的一个机会 ” ， 并且说“联合起来比各自为战的效果要好很多 ” 。	In announcing a new Sino-US joint research effort, Chu described clean energy as “one of the great opportunities of our time” for Sino-US cooperation, saying that by “working together, we can accomplish more than [by] acting alone.”
主要国家承认伊朗拥有和日本类似的核地位的意愿不仅仅取决于伊朗是否将自己作为一个危机时的大国－它偶尔这样作－而且取决于它是否这样行为。	The willingness of major countries to accept Iran with a nuclear status similar to Japan depends on whether Iran not only refers to itself as a status-quo power – which it occasionally does – but whether it acts as such.
随着战后一代老去 — — 他们大部分人至少已经60岁，其领袖要么身居高位，要么是资深政客 — — 对一体化的支持正在消失。	As the post-war generation ages – with most of its members now at least 60 years old and its leaders either in senior leadership positions or acting as senior statesmen – the remaining support for integration is waning.
苏格兰第一大臣、苏格兰民族党领袖尼古拉·斯特金（Nicola Sturgeon）抨击威斯敏斯特围绕财政整合计划的“愉快共识 ” 。	Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP, attacked the “cozy consensus” around fiscal consolidation in Westminster.
自从1997年6月26日这位年轻的魔法师首次露面以来，这个“大难不死的男孩”已经成为“坚韧隐忍的象征 ” 。	Since the young wizard’s first appearance on June 26, 1997, the “Boy Who Lived” has become the “Icon Who Endures.”
美联储透露这一决策完全没有考虑高通胀的风险，并急于将失业率推低至大多数经济学家认为的“自然”失业率（约5 % ） 以下。	The Fed revealed that it was entirely unconcerned about the risks of higher inflation and was eager to push unemployment below what most economists regard as its “natural” rate of around 5%.
尽管这种服务目前还只是针对个人，但许多公司也可以借助HealthRally公司来改善自身的健康福利项目。	While the service is currently designed for individuals, companies could also use HealthRally to enhance their corporate wellness programs.
德拉吉经济学的第三个要素 — — 类似于安倍经济学的QQE — — 是以购买公公债券和提振私人部门信用增长的措施为形式的量化和信用扩张。	The third element of Draghinomics – similar to the QQE of Abenomics – will be quantitative and credit easing in the form of purchases of public bonds and measures to boost private-sector credit growth.
第三，德国的长期利率不会受到影响，因为德国既不需要担保该债务转换机制，也不需要支持欧洲央行的债券发行。	Third, Germany’s long-term interest rates would be unaffected, because Germany would neither be guaranteeing the debt-conversion scheme nor backing the ECB’s bond issues.
好消息是我们有很多办法可以通过改善后的激励机制减少（温室气体的）排放—其中一个办法是取消对低效使用能源的种种补贴。	The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions – partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages.
黑色星期一后一天，经济部长乌留卡耶夫（Alexey Ulyukaev）表示CBR本应该更快提高利率。	The day after Black Monday, Minister of Economy Alexey Ulyukaev said that the CBR should have increased interest rates sooner.
在17世纪和18世纪里，德国移民，即所谓的德裔宾州人，将这一传统带到了美国，并从那里传扬到全世界，就好像为可口可乐打造市场品牌一样。	In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, German immigrants, the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch, carried them to the United States, from where they later spread to the rest of the world, if only as marketing icons for Coca Cola.
历史学家可能会就该学院存在与否及所起作用争论不休；但它在伊斯兰世界依然具备的象征意义远比这样的争论更加重要。	Historians may bicker over whether such an academy truly existed and what function it served; but such arguments are less relevant than the symbolic power it still holds in the Islamic world.
我加入了卫生支持组织普及挑战组织（Access Challenge ） ， 发起了今年联合国大会的非正式议程“一个接一个：目标2030 ” （ One by One: Target 2030）项目。	That is why I joined with the health advocacy organization Access Challenge to launch the “One by One: Target 2030” campaign on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this year.
安塔利亚 — — 最近由哈利法·塔希夫塔将军领导的利比亚政变终于彻底戳穿了该国政令出不了首都的黎波里的孱弱中央政府能够有效执政的幻觉。	ANTALYA – The recent coup attempt in Libya, led by General Khalifa Hiftar, has finally pierced the illusion that the country’s dysfunctional central government, whose power is limited to the capital, Tripoli, can rule effectively.
如今许多发展中国家 — — 尤其是亚洲各国 — — 的宏观经济形势都比1990年代末亚洲金融危机或是2008年全球金融危机爆发前要更好。	Many developing countries – especially in Asia – are in much better macroeconomic shape than they were just before the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s or at the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis.
与此同时，方济各的耶稣会背景让他拥有一定程度的独立性和���聪明（比如若无其事突然同时封圣若望二十三世和若望·保禄二世 ） 。	At the same time, Francis’s Jesuit background has instilled in him a certain independence and flair for the quirky (like nonchalantly sanctifying John XXIII and John Paul II in one fell swoop).
