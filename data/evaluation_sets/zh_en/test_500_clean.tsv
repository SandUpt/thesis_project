印度储备银行行长拉古兰·拉詹（Raghuram Rajan）最近呼吁发达经济体央行通过国际合作顾及新兴市场国家的利益。	Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has recently called for the advanced economies’ central banks to take emerging-market countries’ interests into account via international cooperation.
当然，这并没有使共产党不那么讨厌自由的媒体和欣欣向荣的文明社会，正是它们可以提供重要的信息反馈以确保任何国家的福址。	It has not helped, of course, that the Communist Party loathes a free press and a robust civil society, both of which are essential information feedback loops in ensuring any country’s well-being.
人和人格，以及他们彼此的感觉，能够让小规模的债务看起来如同无法维持，也能够让大规模债务在握手间烟消云散。	People and their personalities, and the way they perceive one another, can make small debts seem unserviceable or large debts disappear with a handshake.
当弗拉基米尔•普京作为俄罗斯的新科总统在2000年到达巴黎时，他所带去的是一个简单而令人欣慰的信息。	When he first arrived in Paris in 2000 as the newly elected President of Russia, Vladimir Putin had a simple and reassuring message to convey.
美国成功的另一个原因是它像磁石一样吸引着来自世界各地最优秀的人才，他们为美国版的全球熔炉贡献着自身的才智和力量。	Another reason for America’s success is that it has been a magnet for the best and brightest from around the world, who have contributed their own talents and energy to the melting pot of America’s narrative.
布鲁塞尔 - - 美国引人入胜的总统大选或许吸引了所有的头条新闻，但是欧洲也在进行一场领导权的斗争。	BRUSSELS – America’s riveting presidential election campaign may be garnering all the headlines, but a leadership struggle is also underway in Europe.
答案就在以下事实。 由美国及其他八个太平洋经济体政府（澳大利亚、文莱、智利、马来西亚、新西兰、秘鲁、新加坡和越南）提出的跨太平洋合作伙伴关系协定（TTP）的目标并不仅是贸易。	The answer lies in the fact that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), launched by Obama and the governments of eight other Pacific economies – Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam – is not just about trade.
）专家认同可以控制疾病的传播速度，但不同意能“彻底遏制 ” 。 承诺或暗示能把传染病挡在国门之外或一旦传入将被立即消灭的官员今后将面对公众的怒火。	Experts agree that pandemics can be slowed, but not “contained.” Officials who promise – or imply – that they can keep this pandemic from their borders, or stop it once it has arrived, are setting themselves up for public outrage later.
但大部分过度储蓄、支出不足的国家并没有减少储蓄、增加支出；它们的经常项目盈余一直在增加，加剧了全球需求的疲软，因而拖累增长。	But most countries that were over-saving and under-spending have not saved less and spent more; their current-account surpluses have been growing, aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth.
20世纪30年代，当开放社会的敌人们威胁到欧洲时，至少有一个强大的对抗模式存在于英国以及（特别是）美国，受到罗斯福新政的有力支持。	When the enemies of the open society were threatening Europe during the 1930s, there was at least a powerful counter model in Britain, and especially the US, bolstered by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.
如果它们无法快速行动起来重塑自己作为可信、高效的选民利益代表的形象，它们就有可能沦为政治背景，让不负责任的民粹主义逐渐占据中心舞台。	If they do not act fast to re-establish themselves as credible and effective representatives of voters’ interests, they risk fading into the political background, allowing irresponsible populists gradually to take center stage.
传递私人讯息的公告牌能够如此容易的占领公共空间是因为俄罗斯的公共空间几乎是闲置的：国家和社会之间的交流即便是有也少得可怜，而公共辩论则几乎没有。	The billboards with their private messages were able to occupy public space so easily because in Russia public space is virtually empty: there's very little, if any, communication between state and society, and barely any public debate.
在当前环境中，地缘政治紧张升级、信任缺失以及对关键性机构的不尊重所形成的累积效应可能带来一次重大冲击，也有可能只是令投资条件出现恶化。	In the current context, the cumulative effect of rising geopolitical tensions, loss of trust, and disrespect for key institutions could produce either a large shock or just deteriorating conditions for investment.
公司的思维（通常暗地里如此）是，通过污染环境实现TSR最大化是可以接受的，只要给CSR项目做一些贡献作为补偿 — — 就好像在恒河里洗一洗就能带走一个人的罪恶一样。	The thinking, mostly implicit, is that maximizing TSR by polluting the environment is acceptable as long as some compensating contributions are made to CSR initiatives – the corporate equivalent of bathing in the Ganges to wash away one’s sins.
海外印度人也依然心系故土，境外汇款总额不断增长，在2008~2009年间达到了464亿美元，其中大部分是来自那些在海湾地区打工的印度蓝领工人。	Indians abroad stayed loyal to India: remittances from overseas Indians remained robust, reaching $46.4 billion in 2008-2009, the bulk of which came from the mainly blue-collar Indian expatriate community in the Gulf countries.
但是这些技术还没有成形，而且我们不能单纯地等待市场来实现这些技术，因为它们要求公共政策上复杂的改变来确保它们安全可靠以及可以为大众所接受。	Yet the technologies are not yet ready, and we can’t simply wait for the market to deliver them, because they require complex changes in public policy to ensure that they are safe, reliable, and acceptable to the broad public.
穆尔西所采纳的列宁主义的“民主集中制”如果持续下去，将是对旧国家组织中的新一代人及其盟友的崛起的挑衅，这甚至会导致内战的代价。	The Leninist “democratic centralism” to which Morsi seemed to have subscribed, if maintained, will be a standing provocation to the new generations and their allies in the old state apparatus to rise up, even at the price of civil war.
它让我想起了1989年秋天布拉格温塞拉斯广场上回荡的键音 ― ― 后来这种声音响彻当时捷克斯洛伐克的其它地方。	It reminds me of the jingle of keys that rang out on Prague’s Wenceslas Square -- and later around the rest of what was then Czechoslovakia -- in the autumn of 1989.
但中国领导人必须认识到，中国面连着大规模福利损失，因此需要拿出接受短期增长放缓以换取更稳定的长期增长路径的意愿。	But China’s leaders must recognize that the country faces massive welfare losses, and thus should be willing to accept slower growth in the short term in exchange for a more stable long-term growth path.
虽然该组织只不过是将白俄罗斯、亚美尼亚、哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、乌兹别克斯坦以及俄罗斯间的双边军事协议强行堆砌在一起，而对此克林姆林宫当局依然感觉良好，安之若素。	For all this, the Kremlin is not in the least embarrassed by the fact that the CSTO is essentially a mechanical connection of bilateral military agreements between Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia.
随着国民政治冷淡程度达到了1930年代那段最黑暗时期以来的高点，欧洲屈服于破坏性民粹主义力量的风险也日渐增大。	With political disenchantment reaching levels not seen since the continent’s darkest times in the 1930s, the risk that Europe will succumb to the destructive forces of populism looms ever larger.
在1945年后的最初三十年间，起主导作用的是布雷顿森林共识 — — 一个允许决策者在关注国内的社会和就业需要的同时，能够使全球 贸易恢复和繁荣的肤浅的多边主义。	The first three decades after 1945 were governed by the Bretton Woods consensus – a shallow multilateralism that permitted policymakers to focus on domestic social and employment needs while enabling global trade to recover and flourish.
该条约由罗纳德·里根和苏共总书记米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫于1987年签署，要求双方销毁地面发射的弹道导弹和巡航导弹，而美国的撤出则标志着新一轮军备竞赛的开始。	Signed in 1987 by Ronald Reagan and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, the INF required both the US and Russia to eliminate ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles. The US withdrawal from it signals the start of a new arms race.
这些结果的任何一个都有悖于中国的战略利益；但和许多政府一样，中国领导人将避免短期的艰难决定，即使这会导致长期的不利结果。	Any of these outcomes would be inconsistent with Chinese strategic interests; but, like many governments, China’s leaders will seek to avoid difficult decisions in the short run, even if this results in damaging outcomes over time.
叙利亚人权观察组织（Syrian Observatory for Human Rights）估算，在过去四年中，近250,000人被杀，包括100,000多名平民，其中有许多是被本国政府以骇人听闻的方式杀害的。	The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that, over the last four years, nearly 250,000 people have been killed, including more than 100,000 civilians, many of whom were killed in horrific ways by their own government.
尽管签署了明斯克 II停火协议，乌克兰依然被俄国支持的分离主义分子所部分占领， 间歇性的战斗仍在进行中。	Ukraine remains under partial occupation by Russian-backed separatists, with intermittent fighting still taking place, despite the Minsk II ceasefire agreement.
除了升级制造业之外，发展中国家应准备好实现向服务业的转型，因为随着收入的增加这是不可避免的 （尽管准确时间很难预测 ） 。	Beyond upgrading manufacturing, developing countries should be preparing for the shift toward services that they will inevitably undergo as incomes rise (though the precise timing is hard to predict).
随着金砖国家在全球经济中的作用越来越大，大型拉美国家与金砖国家保持一致，寻求更大的国际影响力倒也无可厚非。	Given their growing role in the global economy, it is understandable that larger Latin American countries, along with the other BRICS, are seeking a more influential world role.
但特朗普本人的不靠谱承诺 — — 包括在英国和墨西哥之间建设一道墙以及让制造业岗位从海外回到美国 — — 仍令许多选民深信不疑。	Yet Trump’s own implausible promises – including his pledges to construct a wall between the US and Mexico and bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas – still seem credible to many voters.
部分归因于政府的刺激政策，自2008年以来中国增长更多地是由投资而不是消费推动的，这阻碍了世界急需的需求再平衡的进展。	Partly owing to government stimulus measures, China’s growth since 2008 has been driven more by investment than by consumption, which has impeded the economy’s much-needed demand rebalancing.
比如，看起来十分温和的抵制、撤资和制裁运动（Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions，BDS ） — —其许多支持者视其为合法的非暴力抵制 — — 一直在不断赢得进展。	For example, the seemingly benign Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, viewed by many of its supporters as a legitimate form of non-violent resistance, has continued to gain ground.
森林还是一座巨大的“碳沉淀池 ” ， 数百年来存储了巨量大气二氧化碳；因此，保护森林有助于遏制气候变化。	"Forests also serve as an enormous “carbon sink,"" storing atmospheric carbon dioxide for many decades or centuries; thus, protecting forests would help to mitigate climate change."
美国的经济危机所引发的严重的信贷紧缩加剧了美国经济的衰退，而越来越深重的衰退正在引发金融市场更大规模的损失，从而损害更广层面的经济。	America’s financial crisis has triggered a severe credit crunch that is making the US recession worse, while the deepening recession is leading to larger losses in financial markets – thus undermining the wider economy.
希腊经济正在崩溃，人道主义危机日益严重，若无法达成协议，其政府将别无选择，只能印钱提供基本社会服务。	Given Greece’s collapsing economy and growing humanitarian crisis, the government will have no choice, absent an agreement, but to print money to fund basic social services.
更加糟糕的是，选举中的落败者洛佩兹，似乎更愿意让整个国家陷入混乱之中，而不愿意接受按照宪法他已经失败的事实。	Worst of all, the election loser, López Obrador, seems willing to throw the country into turmoil rather than accept the constitutional legitimacy of his defeat.
比如，据说位于佛罗里达州的范祖尔（Fanjul）兄弟阿方索（Alfonso）和何塞（José）就向1月份特朗普的就职典礼捐赠了五十万美元。	For example, the Florida-based Fanjul brothers, Alfonso and José, reportedly contributed a half-million dollars to Trump’s January inauguration.
财政纪律不应该优先于包含在新协议内的重要结构改革，特别是改进退休金、法律制度、产品市场、公共行政和司法的措施。	Fiscal discipline should not take priority over the important structural reforms included in the new deal, particularly measures to overhaul pensions, the legal system, product markets, public administration, and the judiciary.
由于政府苦于预算不足和债务上升，高科技行业正在接受日益严格的监督，在这样的背景下的这样一则消息让我有些怀疑这个决定。	Coming at a time when the technology industry is under increasing scrutiny in the developed world as governments struggle with budget shortfalls and rising debt, this seems to me to be a questionable decision.
自首相安倍晋三于2012年12月重新执政并实施他的货��和财政刺激以及结构性改革计划以来，对日本人信心的影响可谓深远。	Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe assumed office in December 2012 and launched his program of monetary and fiscal stimulus and structural reform, the impact on Japanese confidence has been profound.
但和中国不同的是，印度的下降势头更为显著 — — 2011年第三季度GDP增速低于7%的临界点，而10月年度工业总产值实际下降了5.1 % 。	But unlike China, the downshift is more pronounced – GDP growth fell through the 7% threshold in the third calendar-year quarter of 2011, and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1% in October.
大体上看，马萨诸塞州或者俄亥俄州每出现1美元的GDP下降，所引发的税率变更和转移支付就将冲抵其中40美分，也因此起到有效的财政刺激作用。	Roughly speaking, each dollar of GDP decline in a state like Massachusetts or Ohio triggers changes in taxes and transfers that offset about 40 cents of that drop, providing a substantial fiscal stimulus.
同时，已经存在的安全事务机构 — — 欧安组织（OSCE ） 、 北约-俄罗斯理事会（NATO-Russia Council）以及欧洲-大西洋合作伙伴理事会（Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council）等等 — — 应该得到强化，而为此设置新机构则没有必要。	Security initiatives should therefore first be discussed bilaterally within the NATO-EU framework; only then should a common position be presented at the OSCE. Speaking to Russia with one voice is absolutely essential.
这一决定是为了让彼得森集团能够偿付对银行和普雷索尔债务。 在股票收购中，彼得森集团并没有付钱，而是赊账向普雷索尔进行了收购。	That decision was intended to allow the Petersen Group to service the debts to banks, and to Repsol itself, that it incurred with its share purchase, for which it made no initial payment.
人们曾经希望产品和金融市场的彻底融合会暴露哪些低效行业，把资金流从发展迟缓的国家转移到更加高效的使用者。	It was expected that full integration of product and financial markets would expose inefficiencies, steering investment flows away from laggards towards the more efficient countries.
然而，对猛虎解放组织的胜利，不一定要排除某种保证泰米尔人有一些政治发言权的地方分权形式，只要这种地方自治的程度不至于破坏斯里兰卡的国家统一。	Nevertheless, victory over the Tigers need not rule out some form of decentralization that guarantees the Tamils some political say, so long as a degree of local autonomy does not destroy Sri Lanka’s unity.
相反，战争在国家和非国家行动方之间展开，比如尼日利亚和博科圣地组织（Boko Haram）之间，或印度和纳萨尔（Naxalite）叛军之间。	Instead, wars are between states and non-state actors – between, say, Nigeria and Boko Haram, or between India and its Naxalite insurgents.
对于她那些挥舞着口红的拥趸们来说，佩林是一个朴实、虔诚的“冰球母亲 ” ， 她喜欢捕猎美洲驼鹿、信仰福音教义以及甚至有些混乱的家庭生活，都显示她是一个真实的并且典型的美国人。	To her legions of lipstick-waving fans on the right, Palin is a down-to-earth, God-fearing “hockey mom” whose moose hunting, evangelical faith, and even chaotic family life are all evidence that she is a real, typical American.
更近的例子则有1994年导致80万人死亡的卢旺达大屠杀，以及1995年斯雷布雷尼察地区数千名波斯尼亚男性遭屠杀的事件，当时许多人都发誓不会再让这类惨剧重演。	More recently, after a genocide that cost nearly 800,000 lives in Rwanda in 1994, and the slaughter of Bosnian men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995, many people vowed that such atrocities should never again be allowed to occur.
我们希望《2005国防评估》会着手解决这一问题，虽然它肯定会回答一些战略问题而将其他的留在日后商榷。	One hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue, although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate.
在世界范围内，可再生能源业的就业增长正在蓬勃发展，而（主要因为燃煤电厂关闭 ） ， 传统发电业的就业状况却正在萎缩。	Worldwide, job growth in the renewables industry is booming, while employment in traditional power generation is shrinking (primarily owing to the closure of coal plants).
《华尔街日报》当然也为特朗普的举动欢呼，但同样欢呼的还有《华盛顿邮报》的大卫·伊格纳修斯，后者声称“领导的道德因素”现在终于进入了特朗普的白宫。	The Wall Street Journal hailed Trump’s move, of course, but so did the Washington Post’s David Ignatius, who claimed that “the moral dimensions of leadership” had now found its way into the Trump White House.
比如，寻求吸引投资的政府，可能会将经济利益置于与居民需求同等的地位，从而降低企业环境标准或税收负担。	For example, a government seeking to attract investment might equate economic interests with residents’ needs, and thus lower environmental standards or tax burdens for businesses.
与此同时，特朗普政府采取了极端的、不合道德的反移民政策，比如最近收回的在南部的美墨边境上将移民儿童和他们的家庭分开的政策。	Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pursued extreme and morally unconscionable anti-immigration policies, such as the recently reversed policy of separating migrant children from their families at the southern border with Mexico.
希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯不久前也采纳了类似的论调，宣称“所有进步、民主和亲欧洲的力量都有义务携手并肩站在同一条历史战线上 。 ”	Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras recently adopted similar rhetoric, declaring that “all progressive, democratic, and pro-European forces have a duty to stand side by side on the same side of history.”
这正是好奇心之所以成为一种激情的原因：它不受道德约束，遵从自己的规则。 这也就是为什么社会坚持要以不同的方式来驯服它。	That is precisely what makes it a passion: it is amoral and follows its own laws, which is why society insists on taming it in various ways.
特别值得一提的是，这本书 — — 再加上一篇由高级政府官员匿名撰写的纽约时报评论文章 — — 展示了助手们为阻止一位冷漠、无知和偏执的总统因一时冲动而作出某些灾难性举动可以无所不为到何种程度。	In particular, the book – together with an anonymous New York Times op-ed by a senior administration official – showed how far aides would go to keep an incurious, ignorant, and paranoid president from impulsively doing something disastrous.
从伊斯兰高等教育到伊斯兰银行和宗教官僚机关，马哈蒂尔和安瓦尔偷走了PAS的宗教威望 — — 直到巫统开始分裂。	From Islamic higher education to Islamic banking to religious bureaucracy, Mahathir and Anwar stole the PAS’s religious thunder – that is, until the UMNO split.
地方政府往往更加关注基础设施、教育和住房等涉及地方层面的部分关切 — — 而这些领域并没有受到全球化的大规模影响。	It helps that subnational governments tend to be focused on more local-level concerns – such as infrastructure, education, and housing – that are not perceived as being strongly influenced by globalization.
有些人天真地相信牛吃的是草，现在才发现饲喂肉牛的食品种类繁多，从谷物到鱼肉、养鸡场的垃圾稻草（包括鸡的排泻物）以及屠宰场的下脚料。	People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal, chicken litter (complete with chicken droppings), and slaughterhouse waste.
欧洲远景的失落所造成的影响在2008年秋次贷危机和雷曼倒闭的过程中展露无遗，德国总理默克尔一开始的反应极为民族主义，而且是彻底反欧洲的。	The impact of this lost European perspective became clear in the autumn of 2008 when, in the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-European.
《人民日报》下属的极端民族主义报纸《环球时报》似乎认为，最近在西方发生的恐怖袭击是民主启示录的先兆。	The Global Times, an ultra-nationalist tabloid affiliated with the People’s Daily, seemed to suggest that recent terrorist attacks in the West were a harbinger of some kind of democratic apocalypse.
最后，尽管今天谈论金本位可能给金融市场带来的规范作用，可是金本位国家却经常暂停兑换，这意味着本国货币不能自由兑换成黄金。	Finally, for all the talk today of the discipline that the gold standard supposedly provided, countries that adhered to it regularly suspended convertibility – meaning that the domestic currency could no longer be converted freely into gold.
尽管这些谬误并未让我们质疑全球变暖确实正在发生，确实是人为所致，而且确实将带来很多麻烦，但这些对 IPCC 的质疑也造成了极大的损害。	Although none of these lapses provides any reason to doubt that global warming is real, is man-made, and will create problems for us, these challenges to the IPCC are taking their toll.
如果是后者，那么必须要问一问，这三个经济体中的一个乃至全部是否会与流行的预期相反，将在这个十年余下的时间里给我们一个惊喜？	If it is the latter, one must ask whether, contrary to prevailing expectations, new developments or shifts in any or all three of these economies might surprise us on the upside for the rest of the decade.
对朝鲜战争没有个人记忆或兴趣不大的新几代韩国人显然对美国在南韩对北韩的“阳光政策”中作梗的行为感到憎恶。	New generations of South Koreans, who have no personal recollections of – and perhaps only casual interest in – the Korean War, apparently resent what they regard as America’s undermining South Korea’s “sunshine policy” toward North Korea.
比如，欧元区需要真正的银行联盟（不仅要有共同监督，也要有共同存款保险和共同清算机制）和欧元债券（或类似的债务共同化机制 ） 。	For example, the monetary union needs a real banking union – including not just common supervision, but also common deposit insurance and a common resolution mechanism – and Eurobonds, or some similar vehicle for mutualizing debt.
监管机构学到的智慧是一旦出了什么问题最好赶紧表示“我们早跟你说过了 ” ， 并且偶尔发出些负面警告几乎也没什么坏处。	The received wisdom among regulators is that they are better off being able to say, “We told you so” if something goes wrong, and that there is little downside in occasionally issuing dark warnings.
我最喜欢举的例子是电子病历（我的妻子是医生 ） ， 其中存在着巨大���潜力去以提高美国医疗保健服务的效率。	My favorite example is electronic medical records (my wife is a doctor), which have tremendous potential to enhance the efficiency of health-care delivery in the US.
要点在于跨出你的舒适区，让你自己与周边和你差不多的声音保持距离，并且记住董事要为他们的决定的直接和间接后果负责。	The point is to step outside of one’s comfort zones, distance oneself from the voices around the table that sound just like one’s own, and remember that board members are responsible for the direct and indirect impact of their decisions.
但一些观察者已经看到一些迹象表明这次冲击将带来更大的后果，发达经济体将陷入令人沮丧的反常长期低增长轨道。	But some observers already saw signs that this shock would prove more consequential, with the advanced economies finding themselves locked into a frustrating and unusual long-term low-growth trajectory.
上述发现让科研人员可以选择取得疗效机率更大的患者进入到研究小组，同时避免让可能疗效不佳的患者出现副作用。	Such discoveries have enhanced researchers’ ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug, while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit.
联合国的各成员国现在如何应对—特别是那些相信联合国的使命和价值的国家—可以在解决其它更为广泛的现时地区冲突中助一臂之力，特别是在都支持真主党的伊朗和叙利亚的事务方面。	How member states respond now – especially those who believe in the purpose and value of the UN - may help shape the outcomes of other, wider ongoing regional conflicts, notably with Iran and Syria, both of which support Hezbollah.
我们决不因为保护主义和民族主义政治而降经济分比起来，而必须构建公民与领导人之间的新的社会契约，让所有人在国内获得足够的安全感，保持经济基本对世界开放。	Rather than closing off economies through protectionism and nationalist politics, we must forge a new social compact between citizens and their leaders, so that everyone feels secure enough at home to remain open to the world at large.
事实上，缺乏有勇气的领导人已经使国际社会针对当前埃博拉疫情的有效反应来得太迟，从而大大增加了这次危机所付出的代价。	Indeed, the dearth of bold leadership has already delayed an effective international response to the current Ebola outbreak for far too long, drastically increasing the costs of the crisis.
他启动了对养老金和高等教育方面一直久拖不决的重大改革，在介入科特迪瓦和利比亚事务也做出了正确的选择。	He has also launched a major and long-overdue reform of the pension system and higher education. He made the right choices in intervening in Côte d’Ivoire and Libya.
法德两国政府最近决定推动共同开发新型战斗机的计划当然算是迈出了良好的第一步，但不要因此寄望能在不久的将来看到任何明显的合作成果。	The French and German governments recently decided to move ahead on a plan jointly to develop a new fighter jet, which is certainly a good first step. But one should not expect to see any spectacular cooperative achievements in the immediate future.
计划可能会在 《福克斯新闻》甚至《纽约时报》专家中引来不错的反响，这些所谓的专家会摸着自己的下巴惋惜民主党人否决特朗普慷慨的基础设施计划。	The plan will be well-received at Fox News, and possibly even by pundits at The New York Times, who might stroke their chins and lament that the Democrats are rejecting Trump’s open hand on infrastructure.
而每年流向当今发展中国家的数额近2.5万亿，即第三世界国家人均每年会得到500美金。 对于那些现在的日收入不足2美金的人而言，这几乎是他们年收入的一半了。	And about $2.5 trillion annually would go to today’s developing countries every year, or $500 a year on average for each individual in the third world, almost half of whom now survive on less than $2 a day.
这一结果对那些熟悉日本银行危机的人来说无比熟悉：僵尸银行贷款给僵尸公司，反而把压力施加到了有活力的企业身上，扼杀了它们的成长。	The result will look familiar to aficionados of Japan’s banking crisis: zombie banks lending to zombie firms, which apply artificial pressure on viable firms, stifling their growth.
而这在一定程度上还是要归功于这位老独裁者。 由于在其死前恢复了国王胡安▪卡洛斯领导下的君主政治，弗朗哥给西班牙提供了一个重建的基础。	Here the old dictator can take some credit, for by re-establishing the monarchy under King Juan Carlos just before he died, Franco provided Spain with a foundation on which to build anew.
总而言之，新兴经济体遭遇的是由外部产生的宏观经济转变，非常规货币政策，大范围的市场波动以及发达市场缓慢增长所带来的挑战。	In short, emerging economies have been challenged by externally generated macroeconomic shifts, unconventional monetary policies, widespread volatility, and slow growth in developed markets.
但叙利亚依然可以实现和平改革，只要国际社会承认一味强调叙利亚的“复杂国情”对其民众不利，就能够影响到和平改革进程的走势。	Peaceful change in Syria can nonetheless be achieved, and the international community can influence that process by recognizing that its continued focus on the country's “complexity” does nothing for its people.
比如，它容忍世界增长最快的核武国家巴基斯坦，尽管用特朗普的话说，巴基斯坦“满嘴荒唐言 ” ， 包括为“我们在阿富汗追捕的恐怖分子提供安全港 。 ”	For example, it tolerates the world’s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal in Pakistan, even though that country, in Trump’s words, has “given us nothing but lies and deceit,” including providing a “safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.”
但国际货币基金组织（IMF）等金融机构现在正在反驳这一“自有资金”的概念，指出政府的风险越高，项目就越不能被定义为的“表外 ” 。	But financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund are now pushing back against this notion of “free money,” by pointing out that the higher the risk for a government, the less a project can be defined as “off-book.”
他们发现在这一时期，当国内企业所得税率高于其他经合组织国家时，企业利润增长的平均值就会超过了 GDP 增长。	They find that, during that period, average corporate-profit growth outpaced GDP growth whenever the domestic corporate-income-tax rate exceeded that of other OECD countries.
IMF是全球金融稳定的法定监护人，预警和预防失败的问题远比其对英国紧缩的看法严重得多，前者会导致极大的代价，并且这些代价往往会影响到无数人，特别是最脆弱群体。	Given that the IMF is the world’s anointed guardian of financial stability, its failure to warn and preempt constitutes a far more grievous lapse than its position on British austerity, with huge costs borne by many, especially the most vulnerable.
而且，即使在胚胎发育时期引起它们之间差异的刺激物早就不存在了，这些细胞的特征也在各自的细胞谱系中分别得到了遗传。	Moreover, the cells’ features are inherited in their respective cell lineages, even though the stimuli that triggered the differences between them during embryonic development are long gone.
上个月，一条从埃及向以色列和约旦输送天然气的管道发生爆炸 — — 这是穆巴拉克政权倒台以来的第15起类似事件 — — 至今没有修复使用。	Last month, a pipeline carrying Egyptian natural gas to Israel and Jordan was bombed – the 15th such attack since Mubarak’s regime was toppled – and remains out of commission.
2016年7月，东盟外交部长会议在联合公报中也没有提到两周前国际仲裁庭所做出的不利于中国的标志性裁决。	In July 2016, ASEAN foreign ministers failed to mention in their joint communiqué the landmark ruling against China that had been issued just two weeks before by an international arbitral tribunal on the disputes.
因此，G20对IMF指导方案的支持对于一个正在试图从金融危机中复苏、同时又在预防危机重演的世界来说并不明智。	So, the G-20’s endorsement of the Fund’s guidelines would not be wise for a world economy trying to recover from one financial crisis while preventing the next one.
采用这一方法，发展中国家可以实现动态增长，形成就业创造和贫困减少的良性循环，即使其总体基础设施和营商环境仍然有所欠缺。	With this approach, a developing country can grow dynamically, and create a virtuous circle of job creation and poverty reduction, even if its overall infrastructure and business environment are still lacking.
比如，国有企业或许可以将它们建立的私募股权资金挂牌，同时将它们投资的国内高科技企业粉饰为潜在挂牌对象。	For example, SOEs may be able to list private-equity funds that they establish, while grooming domestic high-tech firms in which they invest for potential listings of their own.
但现实是，帮助境况类似于巴西的国家正是IMF这样的全球金融机构能够起到建设性作用的领域。 应该指出，今天的IMF比十年前更加灵活和开放。	But the reality is that helping countries in situations like Brazil’s is an area where global financial institutions like the IMF – which, it should be noted, is more flexible and open today than it was a decade ago – can play a constructive role.
为了重塑美国的道德领导力，总统奥巴马必须兑现他曾经说过的话，真正给受压迫的人民带去曙光 — — 如他在就任总统早期在伊斯坦布尔和开罗说的那样。	In order to restore America’s moral leadership, President Barack Obama must make good on his early rhetoric – exemplified in his speeches in Istanbul and Cairo early in his presidency – which demonstrated genuine regard for the oppressed.
显然，多米诺效应并不会止于此处：银行A和银行B的破产可能会把银行C — — 甚至更多的银行 — — 拖入险境。	Obviously, the domino effect need not stop there: the insolvency of banks A and B could get a bank C – and additional banks – into trouble.
如果消费开支一路上涨，我们则希望各国央行提高利率，降低基建开支的热度，从而释放防止通货膨胀和短缺所需的资源。	If consumers go on a spending binge, we expect the world's central banks to raise interest rates to cool off construction spending and free up the resources needed to prevent shortage-inducing inflation.
以色列政府或许是抓住这次残酷谋杀作为借口挑衅哈马斯，促使后者做出可以让以色列反对来入侵和摧毁连通加沙和以色列的地道。	The Israeli government may have seized on the outrageous murders as a pretext for provoking Hamas into a response that would allow Israel, in turn, to invade and destroy the tunnels Hamas has dug from Gaza into Israel.
而特朗普的竞选搭档、印第安纳州州长麦克·彭斯（Mike Pence）2000至2012年间在众议院供职，与众议院议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）和其他共和党领导人关系甚密。	And Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, Governor of Indiana, served in the House from 2000 to 2012 and has close ties to Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders.
同样，美国2003年在伊拉克发动的为期三周的“震慑行动”战役以“胜利”告终，但却为占领者和普通的伊拉克人打开了地狱之门。	Likewise, America’s three-week “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “victory,” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
在加上奥地利、荷兰和未加入欧元区的北欧国家 — — 瑞士、瑞典、丹麦和挪威，北欧国家去年经常项目盈余总量为5110亿美元。	Together with the surpluses of Austria, the Netherlands, and most non-eurozone northern countries – namely, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway – northern Europe has run a current-account surplus of $511 billion over the last 12 months.
虽然富裕女性可以也确实付钱给贫困女性承担照顾工作，但也有很多人选择兼职或弹性工作以便履行子女的鼓励和教育职责。	Although wealthy women can and do buy the care work of poorer women, many also choose to work part-time or flexibly to provide the stimulation and education their children need.
但只要关注重点恰当，他们可以用少得多的资源大幅提高粮仓质量，避免超过30%的粮食 — — 往往靠近那些贫困的农村人口 — — 变质到不适合人类食用。	But, with the right focus and much more modest resources, they could dramatically improve the quality of grain silos where more than 30% of food – typically located close to the rural poor – spoils to the point of being unfit for human consumption.
美国总统奥巴马在去年 11 月的首次访华，以及他所表现出的那种卑微而有求于人的形象，更加强了这种当今和未来两大强权之间可能达成协议的印象。	President Barack Obama’s first visit to China last November, in which he accepted the role of pliant suitor at the court of the emperor, strengthened the impression of a deal between today’s great power and tomorrow’s.
尽管我们历尽艰辛为妇女赢得了不少权益，但对于这个她们 — — 以及她们的孩子的健康和发育的关键问题，我们仍然比计划落后了一百年。	Despite hard-won gains for women, we remain a century behind schedule on an issue that is key to their health and development – and to that of their children.
但它也有极限，越过了极限，对央行财务健全性的信心 — — 以及对货币可靠性的信心 — — 就会受到破坏。	But there are limits beyond which confidence in the financial integrity of central banks – and consequently the soundness of money – will be undermined.
中东地区的威胁是巨大的，并且还在上升，全世界的人都在担心极端主义斗士回国以及一直呆在国内的人受恐怖主义影响。	The threat to the region is large and growing, and it menaces people everywhere, as extremist fighters return home and still others who never left are inspired to do terrible things.
发自华盛顿 — — 虽然沙特驻美大使阿德尔·朱拜尔在美国宣称挫败的暗杀阴谋中毫发未伤，但如果这一行动的真正目标并不是朱拜尔，而是为了破坏伊朗总统内贾德的外交政策的话，那么策划者的目的或许已经实现了。	WASHINGTON, DC – Though Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir is alive and well in Washington, the plot to assassinate him may have succeeded – if its aim was not to kill al-Jubeir, but rather Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s foreign policy.
一个不祥的新词已经悄悄潜入生命科学和生物制药研究 ： “ 生物安全 ” （ biosecirity ） 。	An ominous new word has crept into the life sciences and biomedical research: “biosecurity.”
他们让伊斯兰国得以兴盛 — — 甚至助了伊斯兰国一臂之力 — — 并给全球秩序造成日益严重的威胁，在沙姆沙伊赫、贝鲁特和巴黎接连发生的恐怖袭击悲剧地证明了这一点。	They have enabled – indeed, fueled – the rise of the Islamic State, and with it a growing threat to the global order, as the successive terrorist attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Beirut, and Paris tragically have shown.
除非从现在开始，否则战火将会在政治和宗教的助长下蔓延 — — 受害者也决不会仅限于尼尼微（Nineveh ） 。	Unless we start now, the fires will spread – fanned by politics and religion – and it will not only be Nineveh that is consumed by them.
经济学家信心十足地反对商品补贴，因为农业和能源市场接近于完美竞争，需求端有大量消费者，供给端有大量生产者。	Economists feel confident in opposing commodity subsidies because agricultural and energy markets tend to approach the ideal of perfect competition, with a large number of consumers on the demand side and producers on the supply side.
而且认为不必政治解决叙利亚冲突就能实现上述目标是个严重的错误，伊斯兰国实现爆炸性增长恰恰是借助冲突。	And it is a grave mistake to think that this can be achieved without a political solution to the conflict in Syria – the conflict that enabled the organization’s explosive growth.
考虑到遏制气候变化影响的政治压力，聪明的投资者将密切关注可能导致需求下降的政策信号以及他们的资产财务搁浅的可能性。	Given the political pressure to mitigate the impact of climate change, smart investors will be watching closely for indications of policies that will lead to a drop in demand and the possibility that their assets will become financially stranded.
所幸的是，包括学生、主导民意者以及最主要的是律师在内的巴基斯坦人民挺身支持法官，他们在做本来应该由政党来做的工作。	Fortunately, the people of Pakistan – students, opinion makers, and, above all, lawyers – are standing up for the judges, doing the work that should have been done by political parties.
各国政府和国际货币基金组织这样的机构在努力保持可持续经济复苏、为全世界人民谋福利的过程中必须把这一点铭记在心。	Governments and institutions like the IMF must keep this in mind as they seek to ensure a durable economic recovery that will benefit all of the world's people.
他的左翼联盟党（Syriza）在1月的大选中大获全胜，随后希腊总理齐普拉斯任命瓦鲁法基斯领衔与希腊债权人进行如履薄冰的谈判。	Following an impressive election victory by his Syriza party in January, Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, appointed Varoufakis to lead the delicate negotiations with the country’s creditors.
巴勒斯坦人已经从美国总统奥巴马的特使乔治·米切尔处得到了承诺，保证以色列人不会在未来4个月的间接谈判中作出任何“挑衅行动 ” 。	Palestinians have been assured via a message from President Barack Obama, delivered by his special envoy George Mitchell, that the Israelis will not carry out any “provocations” during the coming four months of indirect negotiations.
有些人无疑已经背叛了政府，其中最具影响力的当属霍姆斯暴行达到高潮后不久，能源部副部长辞职并加入到反对派阵营。	To be sure, the authorities have suffered some defections, with the most significant coming soon after the violence in Homs reached its peak, when the deputy energy minister resigned and joined the opposition.
但是如果把这一问题仅仅丢给以色列和巴勒斯坦，那么巴勒斯坦在其1967年的边界内独立的目标将会遥不可及。	But if left to Israelis and Palestinians alone, the goal of Palestinian independence within the 1967 borders of Palestine will most likely remain out of reach.
在CAFTA的规则下，该协议一旦获得批准，80%从美国出口的货物将会免税，所有的关税都会在15年内取消。	Under CAFTA, 80% of US exports will be duty-free as soon as the treaty is ratified, and all tariffs will expire in 15 years.
我现在了解到，如果非洲想实现农业转型，非洲国家首先需要打消让农业部门落后的主要壁垒 — — 普遍存在的性别差距。	What I am now learning is that if Africa hopes to spark an agricultural transformation, countries will first need to remove one of the main barriers holding the sector back: a pervasive gender gap.
也许比特币投机客是下注于永远会找到流氓国家联盟允许使用匿名的比特币，甚至有朝鲜这样的国家会利用比特币。	Perhaps Bitcoin speculators are betting that there will always be a consortium of rogue states allowing anonymous Bitcoin usage, or even state actors such as North Korea that will exploit it.
事实上，在2001年后的十年中推动两位数增长的投资拉动型增长模式加剧了结构性弱点，目前已到了必须纠正的地步。	In fact, the investment-led growth model that facilitated double-digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses, which must now be addressed.
若我签署了引渡申请文件，其意义将是突破性的，因为它将首次向世人昭示，如果司法公正在本国不可能实现，涉嫌侵犯人权者可以在世界任何地方面临审判。	Signing the papers would be groundbreaking, as it would signal for the first time that suspected rights abusers might face trial anywhere in the world if justice was not likely at home.
就在1979年伊朗爆发伊斯兰革命之前没多久，一份美国中情局报告还将伊朗王朝比作“汪洋中不沉的海岛 ” 。	Just before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, a CIA report characterized the Iranian monarchy as an “island of stability.”
这样的目标有点像国家计划经济的遗留 — — 并与政策制定者把新重点放在市场的“决定性作用”背道而驰。	Such targets smack of the legacy of a state-directed economy – a legacy that runs counter to policymakers’ new emphasis on the “decisive role” of markets.
我们可以从这宗案件（和其他多宗类似案件）中推断的是他们是高度传统的农村社会半城市化的产物，在这样的社会中，人，特别是女人的角色是严格限制的。	From what we can surmise from this case – and many others like it – they are the semi-urbanized products of a highly conventional rural society where the roles of men, and especially women, are tightly regulated.
这些条款的真实意图是阻挠旨在保护美国本国经济和公民的卫生、环境、安全以及 — — 是的，甚至还有金融监管。	The real intent of these provisions is to impede health, environmental, safety, and, yes, even financial regulations meant to protect America’s own economy and citizens.
伊斯坦布尔—在不断向外扩张的大都市伊斯坦布尔有一个塔克西姆广场（Taksim Square ） ， 塔克西姆广场有一个小公园，它是市中心硕果仅存的几处绿色空间之一。	ISTANBUL – The small park in Taksim Square in the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul is one of the few green spaces left in the city center.
每一项研究都解释了绿色经济的一部份，没有一个能涵盖整体 — — 这不是因为这些研究有缺陷，只不过因为这件事已经完全超出了我们的能力之外。	Each of the studies describes a part of a green economy, but none can capture the whole – not because they are deficient, but because it is simply beyond our capability.
如果日本、美国和其他国家试图拦截或者回击朝鲜发射的导弹，那么，军事紧张局势 — — 甚至是可能的对抗 — — 就非常可能会接踵而来。	If Japan, the US, and others attempt to intercept or counter the missile, military tension – even possible combat – is likely to ensue.
2009—2012年希腊政府每季度支出攀升至135亿欧元左右的高峰，然后在2014—2015年下降至96亿美元左右。	Greek government spending per quarter climbed to a plateau of around €13.5 billion ($14.8 billion) in 2009-2012, before falling to roughly €9.6 billion in 2014-2015.
就在一个月前，南亚发生海啸，有关人员死亡、灾民受难以及各种基础设施遭受严重破坏的报道占据了此次海啸报道的主题。	Reports about the tsunamis that devastated Southeast Asia barely a month ago have understandably been dominated by tales of death, suffering, and the physical destruction of infrastructure.
因此即便欧盟体现了我们为确保欧洲在日渐艰难的时势中保持竞争力的良好愿望，它依然受到“为危机全球化推波助澜”的指责。	So, although the EU represents our best hope of ensuring that Europe is internationally competitive in today’s increasingly difficult environment, it is actually being blamed for globalization.
当然， 人们应当注意到，如果资源丰富的非洲经济改革进展得如同亚洲那样，那么，高涨的基本商品价格时代就将会推迟一个世纪。	Of course, it should be noted that if economic reform in resource-rich Africa had been proceeding at the same pace as in Asia, the era of soaring commodity prices might have been postponed for another century.
事实上，辅助性原则 — — 决策应该在尽可能地方的层面发生 — — 对于能良好运转的灵活的全球治理至关重要。	Indeed, the principle of subsidiarity – whereby decision-making should occur at the most local level possible – is crucial to flexible, functioning global governance.
然而除了勉强承认其关于喜马拉雅冰川的预测是“有悖事实”之外， IPCC 没有承认任何其他的错漏 — — 更遑论为此而道歉了。	Yet, aside from a grudging admission that its predictions about Himalayan glaciers were “poorly substantiated,” the IPCC has yet to acknowledge – much less apologize for – any of the lapses.
而肯尼亚无处不在的移动银行服务M-Pesa显然让贫困妇女能够从小农经济转向非农业经济，从而为最底层民众带来了显著收入增长。	Kenya’s ubiquitous mobile banking service M-Pesa appears to have enabled poor women to move out of subsistence agriculture into non-farm businesses, providing a significant bump up the income ladder at the very bottom.
尽管广泛利润分享计划表现出诸多好处，但只有三分之一的美国私营部门员工参与其中，并且只有大约20%持有本公司股票。	Despite the demonstrated benefits of broad-based profit-sharing programs, only about one-third of US private-sector workers participate in them, and about 20% own stock in their companies.
如果我们认识到创新来自理解地方情况和优化私人部门的巨量资源，我们就能确保未来更好的健康情况 — — 和更快的经济增长。	If we recognize that innovation stems from understanding local conditions and optimizing the vast resources of the private sector, we can ensure better health – and more rapid economic growth – far into the future.
2016年，发达国家应该同意接受每年总数接近100万的难民，方式可以是安置，也可以是提供人道、学生、劳工和其他签证。	In 2016, developed countries should agree to accept a combined total approaching a million refugees annually, either through resettlement or by issuing humanitarian, student, labor, and other visas.
由拉美人、东欧犹太人、意大利人、亚洲人、爱尔兰人和现在依然对牛津剑桥的双桨滑过查尔斯河河水魂牵梦绕的英裔美国人共同组成了伟大的美国民众。	In the United States, it is that great people composed of Latinos, Eastern European Jews, Italians, Asians, Irish, and, yes, Anglos still dreaming of Oxford-Cambridge sculls now cleaving the waters of the Charles River.
2010年以来房地产投资减少带来的负面影响比预期深远。 事实的确如此，几乎所有在8月下跌超过10%的各类进口项目都与房地产投资有关。	The negative impact of the fall in real-estate investment since 2010 has been deeper and longer than expected; indeed, almost all categories of imports that fell by 10% or more in August were related to real-estate investment.
与此同时，他们的行为 — — 以及其他银行家的类似行为 — — 却直接导致了住宅价格的上涨以及随后的毁灭性崩溃。	At the same time, their actions – and similar actions by other bankers – are directly responsible for both the run-up in housing prices and the damaging collapse that followed.
和这种个人化相关的大脑区域是从我们的贸易伙伴还是小型氏族团体成员的时候开始进化的。 在那样的情况下，违反道德的行为会被即时发现并加以纠正。	This personalization draws upon regions of the brain that evolved when our trading partners were members of small kin-based groups where moral violations were immediately identified and remedied.
这就解释了美国的房地产，纽约、伦敦和法兰克福的股票，世界各地的长期债券与人们认可的传统基本价值之间形成的巨大落差。	This explains the large gaps between current prices for real estate in the US, equities in New York, London, and Frankfurt, and long-term bonds everywhere and what one would conventionally think their fundamental values should be.
苏格兰微生物学家亚历山大·弗莱明（Alexander Fleming）发现能够杀死细菌的菌类后不久就认识到，过度使用抗生素会引起耐药性。	Not long after the Scottish microbiologist Alexander Fleming discovered a fungus that could kill bacteria, he recognized that overuse of antibiotics would encourage resistance.
如今，中国正意欲把核心利益一词用于与日本的钓鱼岛之争，甚至不顾危险地将它用于对整个南海的主张：事实上，一些军官已经在这么用了。	Now China is attempting to apply the same term to the Senkaku Islands in its dispute with Japan, and is perilously close to making the same claim for the entire South China Sea; indeed, some Chinese military officers already have.
纽约 — — 1945年广岛和长崎被毁标志着一个时代的结束和另一个时代的开始。 二战结束后冷战开始，世界小心翼翼地维护着摇摇欲坠的和平。	NEW YORK – The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 marked an end and a beginning. The close of the Second World War ushered in a Cold War, with a precarious peace based on the threat of mutually assured destruction.
正如萨默斯所警告的，坚持这样做只能在不可避免的失败前造成“不必要的痛苦 ” ， 让希腊（其实远不止希腊）崩溃。	Staying the course, as Summers warns, will lead only to “needless suffering” before that course inevitably collapses, bringing Greece – and much else –­ crashing down.
中国正处于结构转型中，必须警惕避免经济增长对既存增长源泉的削弱，以免掉入结构性陷阱造成结构转型成本过高，抵消转型的好处。	China is in the midst of that process, and it must be careful not to undermine existing sources of growth lest it fall into a structural trap where the cost of transition itself derails new gains.
简而言之，西方的对乌战略应该是在大选之前刺激该国经济，然后再与大选后建立的政府谈判建立一个改革方案。	In short, the Western strategy for Ukraine should be to stimulate the Ukrainian economy until the May election and then negotiate a package of reforms with the government that emerges.
我们面临的挑战是向年轻人证明我们很容易被恐怖分子的诉求所影响 — — 恐怖分子会告诉我们，有更好的办法让你的声音被听到，你可以通过更有意义的方式参与到世界中去。	The challenge is to show young people who are vulnerable to appeals from terrorists that there is a better path to having their voice heard, a more meaningful way to engage with the world.
随着21世纪的深入，大部分发达国家都将经历人口短缺，但美国是其中少数可能避免人口下降、维持其世界人口比例的国家之一。	Whereas most developed countries will experience a shortage of people as the century progresses, America is one of the few that may avoid demographic decline and maintain its share of world population.
因此即便企业更容易得到钱和贷款，许多公司依然不愿意大规模招人，因此害怕在未来经济下滑时要背上一张巨额工资单。	Hence, even if businesses get easier access to money and loans, many firms will still decline to hire on a large scale, fearing that they would be saddled with a large payroll in a future downturn.
伊朗觊觎核武器能力并且指使其什叶派代理人好战份子，不仅威胁以色列以及该地区，而且还在寻求僭取温和的逊尼派阿拉伯政权传统的巴勒斯坦人保护人的角色。	Iran not only threatens Israel (and the region) with its desire for a nuclear capability and its Shi’a proxy militants; it is also seeking to usurp the traditional role of moderate Sunni Arab regimes as the Palestinians’ defenders.
跟医学一样，经济学也被划分成许多不同的门类 — — 宏观经济学家一般不会关注金融经济学家或地产经济学家究竟在干什么，反之亦然。	Like medicine, economics has become highly compartmentalized – macroeconomists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real-estate economists study, and vice versa.
面对如此的现实，住在赫尔辛基的公务员Jiri Räsänen刚开始也同样感到沮丧，但随后他和他的朋友们想到了一个好主意：为什么不能在保留汽车的前提下，而只是更换发动机呢？	That fact at first depressed Jiri Räsänen, a civil servant in Helsinki – but then it gave him and his friends a good idea. Why not keep the cars but replace their engines?
美国石油生产商的补贴常常打着国家安全旗号；事实上 ， “ 先耗尽美国”的政策从长期看降低了能源自给率。	Subsidies to US oil producers have often been sold on national-security grounds; in fact, a policy to “drain America first” reduces self-sufficiency in the longer run.
美国对日本的出口几乎100％都是以美元计价的，意味着这些出口就像弗里德曼的版本一样是对美元有粘性的。	Almost 100% of US exports to Japan are priced in dollars, meaning that they, as in Friedman’s version, are sticky in dollars.
从根本上来说，它必须采用一个以规则为基础的机制来处理与两个邻国的关系，而也是中国政府对此患得患失的原因。	In essence, it would have to accept a rules-based system for its relations with its two neighbors, something of which China’s government has been wary.
它们的邻国中不乏深陷内部冲突或艰难转型者，国内不满情绪也在不断升级。 海湾国家急切地想平息革命浪潮。	With their neighbors embroiled in internal conflict or in the midst of difficult transitions, and with discontent rising at home, the Gulf states are eager to stem the tide of revolution.
而国会预算办公室则预计美国的财政赤字将在未来十年平均维持在GDP的5%左右，并因此导致政府债务占GDP的比例从2009年度的低于60%上升到90 % 。	The Congressional Budget Office projects that the country’s fiscal deficit will average 5% of GDP for the rest of the decade, driving government debt to 90% of GDP, from less than 60% of GDP in 2009.
但那些新一代马尔萨斯主义者反对将这些巨大的利益扩展到世界更多地方，因为他们认为全球变暖状况是如此恶劣以致必须去阻止增长。	The latter-day Malthusians are opposed to extending these tremendous benefits to more of the world because they believe that global warming will be so bad that it justifies stopping growth.
波兰、匈牙利和土耳其政府越来越极权，和巴尔干国家、中国和俄罗斯的领导人一样，它们越来越热衷于控制公共话题。	The governments of Poland, Hungary, and Turkey have become increasingly authoritarian and – like leaders in the Balkans, China, and Russia – increasingly eager to control public discourse.
食品价格通胀达到了两位数，人们对有多大比例的印度人生活在贫困线以下甚至贫困县应该划在什么水平争论不休。	Double-digit food-price inflation has been accompanied by debate about the share of Indians living below the poverty line, and, indeed, where the poverty line should be drawn.
20世纪90年代，发展中国家增长开始总体快于发达国家（用人均标准衡量 ） ， 这让很多人乐观地认为这两类国家的产出和收入将会趋于一致。	In the 1990s, developing economies, taken as a whole, began to grow faster than their advanced counterparts (in per capita terms), inspiring optimism that the two groups’ output and income would converge.
埃及前总统萨拉特对耶路撒冷的访问，以及以埃两国随后在美国戴维营达成的突破性成果，都是在双方前期私下取得谅解之后发生的。	The visit to Jerusalem of Egypt's then-President Anwar el-Sadat, and the ensuing Egypt-Israel breakthrough at Camp David, took place only after successful behind-the-scenes understandings.
而这个引发众多争议的提议 — — 其中最著名的倡议者是约翰•凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes ） — —要求为初级商品建立一个“缓冲库存 ” ， 当价格下跌时吸纳产品，反之则增加供应量。	This argument inspired proposals – most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 – to create “buffer stocks” for the main commodities, which would take supply off the market when prices fell, and add to supply when prices rose.
与此同时，2001年，利用美国专利商标局反应慢的弱点，Proctor对科罗拉多州16家小型种子公司提出侵犯专利权的诉讼。	Meanwhile, in 2001, taking advantage of the USPTO’s slow response, Proctor sued 16 small seed companies in Colorado for patent-infringement.
欧洲一体化就是多边全球主义实验的核心；随着法国与德国和解，欧洲这个自古以来冲突不断的地带成为了模范合作者的土地。	European integration was at the core of this experiment in multilateral globalism; with Franco-German reconciliation, Europe, a chronic conflict zone, became a region of exemplary cooperators.
事实上，自2008年初以来，平均年化真实消费支出增长只有1.3 % — —为有记录以来消费增长最萎靡的阶段。	In fact, since early 2008, annualized growth in real consumer expenditure has averaged a mere 1.3% – the most anemic period of consumption growth on record.
北京吸引了中国最顶尖的政治评论家，他们不喜欢讨论那些单调的宗教议题，而耶路撒冷的社会评论家则致力于解读那些将人们团结在一起的宗教。	Beijing attracts China’s leading political critics, while Jerusalem’s social critics argue for an interpretation of religion that holds people, rather than inanimate objects, sacred.
但自 20 世纪 90 年代起，后退速度有所回落，因为一些知名大冰川，如根戈德里冰川和锡亚琴冰川的后退 ， “ 在 2007~2009 年期间实际上已经处于停滞状态 。 ”	But the retreat slowed after the mid-1990’s until, for some of the biggest and best-known glaciers, such as Gangotri and Siachen, it had “practically come to a standstill during the period 2007-2009.”
根据新气候经济（New Climate Economy）计划的数据，到2030年全球基础设施投资将达到89万亿美元 — — 而要让这些投资变得低碳而高恢复力，必须在增加4.1万亿美元投资。	According to the New Climate Economy initiative, $89 trillion will be spent on global infrastructure investment by 2030 – with an additional $4.1 trillion needed to make it low-carbon and resilient.
欧洲是一个地理和历史的独特结合体，但是欧洲的边界 — — 以及它未来扩大的前景 — — 是由成员国的容纳能力和适应能力所决定的。	Europe is a peculiar combination of geography and history, but the boundaries of the EU – and thus the prospects for its further enlargement – are determined by its absorptive capacity and the adaptive abilities of candidate countries.
比方说我们可以通过重点研究各器官特性来加深对器官和组织包块或对肝脏、胰腺等器官脂肪浸润的理解，而避免把注意力放在全身的总体得分上。	We can understand more about organ and tissue masses, for example, or fatty infiltrations in individual organs like the liver and pancreas, by focusing on the nature of each body component, rather than by relying on an overall body score.
发自墨尔本 — — 许多年前，当我和太太开车载着三个年幼的女儿出行时，其中一个突然问了一句 ： “ 爸爸妈妈你们是希望我们聪明一点呢，还是快乐一点呢 ？ ”	MELBOURNE – Many years ago, my wife and I were driving somewhere with our three young daughters in the back, when one of them suddenly asked: “Would you rather that we were clever or that we were happy?”
2013年，增税、隔离程序要求的政府支出削减、政府临时关门以及有约束力的赤字上限可能要求政府进一步削减支出对经济产生了拖累。	The economy in 2013 was held back by tax increases, government spending cuts mandated by the sequester process, the temporary government shutdown, and the possibility that a binding debt ceiling would require further cuts in government outlays.
他希望德国能够脱离纳粹主义，纳粹主义能被摧毁的同时而德国不被摧毁，从而让这个伟大国家作为抵御苏联的桥头堡。	He hoped that Germany could be separated from Nazism, that Nazism could be destroyed without destroying Germany, thus preserving that great nation as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.
他甚至宣称为自己并未强制执行“红线 ” — —在2012年就叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德（Bashar al-Assad）的使用化学武器而划定的界限 — — 而感到自豪，因为无论国际法还是美国国会都不会批准实施干预。	He even claimed to be proud of not enforcing the “red line” he had drawn in 2012 regarding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, as neither international law nor the US Congress would have sanctioned intervention.
由于起领导作用的国家不能或者不愿 — — 究竟属于哪种情况已经很难搞清 — — 继续管理日益增加的资金流，导致布雷顿森林体系于20世纪70年代陷入崩溃。	The Bretton Woods regime collapsed in the 1970’s as a result of the inability or unwillingness – it is not entirely clear which – of leading governments to manage the growing tide of capital flows.
他们的关注点应该被聆听和讨论；有时禁止最好辅之以国民教育方面的新措施，比如强调移民并没有导致希腊的萧条。	Their concerns should be heard and debated; and sometimes banning is best combined with renewed efforts at civic education, emphasizing, for example, that immigrants did not cause Greece’s woes.
2003—2004年，日本财务省购买了大量美元，从而在日本银行不愿采取公开市场操作的情况下放松了货币条件。	From 2003 to 2004, the Japanese treasury purchased a large amount of dollars, thereby easing monetary conditions at a time when the BOJ was reluctant to pursue open market operations.
另一大复杂性叙利亚的少数派阿拉维派统治着占多数的逊尼派，这使得叙利亚成为什叶派伊朗在逊尼派阿拉伯世界中的代理。	Another is Alawite-minority rule in a Sunni-majority country, which makes Syria a proxy for Shia Iran in the Sunni Arab world.
此外欧洲还有很深的研究人才储备 — — 全球最顶尖的十家计算机科学研究所中有五家位于欧盟 — — 欧洲的创业繁荣看上去可以维持。	Add to that deep research talent – five of the top ten global computer science faculties are within the EU – and Europe’s start-up boom looks sustainable.
气候变化不是我们国家为了保持自然之美而必须克服的最令人生畏的挑战 — — 哥斯达黎加是每平方米生物多样性最好的国家之一。	Climate change is not the first daunting challenge our country – among the world’s most biodiverse countries per square meter – has had to overcome to preserve its natural beauty.
同时，在美国的财政系统中，国税要占总税收的三分之二，这意味着收入暂时下降的州可以自动且持续地获得净财政转移支持。	The recent collapse of those bubbles caused sharp downturns in economic activity and substantial increases in unemployment in both countries.
这部分是因为欧洲实行高税收，任何人对此都无能为力：如果人们认为自己拿回家的报酬太低，而边际税率太高，没有人能强迫他们去工作。	This is partly due to higher taxes in Europe, and this cannot be undone: nobody can force someone to work if they consider their take-home pay too low because of a high marginal tax rate.
前总统克林顿曾说他为未能充分应对1994年卢旺达爆发的种族灭绝危机而感到遗憾，尽管应该遗憾的人还有很多。	Former President Bill Clinton has said that he regrets his failure to respond adequately to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, although he was not alone.
与此同时，法国和荷兰民众的声音也不应该被忽视，尤其是因为在它们中随便哪一个国家就同一个文本进行二次全民公决都是不可想象的事情。	At the same time, French and Dutch citizens’ voices cannot be ignored – all the more so because it is unimaginable that an identical text could be submitted to a second referendum in either country.
罗姆尼最近承认了这一点，承认“财政断崖 ” — —布什时代的税收减免将于今年年底前结束，再加上已经预定实施的大规模开支削减计划 — — 将联合起来把经济推入衰退。	Romney conceded this point recently, acknowledging that the “fiscal cliff” – the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts at the end of this year, combined with large spending cuts already scheduled to take effect – would push the economy back into recession.
在这一不确定性面前，企业部门在风险最高、资本最密集的投资已经完成之前，或在出现清晰的系统性信号之前是不会进入市场的。	In the face of such uncertainty, the business sector will not enter the market until the riskiest and most capital-intensive investments have been made, or until coherent and systematic political signals have been communicated.
对日本来说，这将是沉重一击，而如果特朗普兑现竞选承诺，要求日本和韩国等盟国增加自身防御的“保护费”日本的损失还会更大。	That will be a big loss for Japan, and the country will lose out even more if Trump follows through on his campaign promise to make allies such as Japan and South Korea pay more for their own defense.
这些新的威胁，正如在‘第三帝国’统治下那样对人类生命表现出同样的蔑视并对建立一种对全世界的独裁表现出同样的渴望 。 ”	These new threats, just as under the Third Reich, show the same contempt for human life and the same aspiration to establish an exclusive dictate over the world.”
但由于预期会因应央行行为做出调整，所以自由裁量的货币政策其实是无效的 — — 只会产生较高的通胀率却缺乏产出或就业增长。	But, because expectations adjust to central bank behavior, discretionary monetary policy is futile: it yields higher inflation but no output or employment increases.
由于许多经济部门缺乏竞争力且教育体系不完善，沙特人口 — — 其中70%不到35岁 — — 将在今后几年经历爆发式失业潮。	Given many economic sectors’ lack of competitiveness and the inadequacy of the educational system, the Saudi population – 70% of which is under 35 years old – will experience skyrocketing unemployment in the coming years.
最近几年，扩大疫苗项目进展迅速，这一信息代表了全球社会的独特机会，特别是在我们即将彻底消灭小儿麻痹症时。	Given the progress made in expanding vaccination programs in recent years, this revelation represents a unique opportunity for the global community, particularly as we begin to close the lid on polio.
所有这些都表明，要么是大选后的跛脚鸭国会会议上，要么在新国会产生后的最初几个月，美国政客可能会消除财政悬崖。	All of this suggests that, whether in the lame-duck congressional session following the elections or in the first few months of the new Congress, US politicians will likely dismantle the fiscal cliff.
为支持经济增长和发展，我们需要发掘所有劳动者的潜力，不仅授予女性赚钱的机会，而且要让她们担负起领导职责。	To support economic growth and development, we need to tap the potential of all workers, giving women opportunities not just to earn, but also to lead.
出席就职典礼的人数 — — 远远少于特朗普愿意相信的规模 — — 可以从现成的证据（包括国家广场的照片和地铁乘客人数等）很容易地推断。	The number of people who attended the inauguration – far less than Trump wanted to believe – could easily be inferred from the available evidence (including photographs of the National Mall and the number of subway riders).
流言通过社交媒体传播，特别是WhatsApp，这导致无辜的人因为被控宰牛、绑架儿童或更恶劣的行为而被暴民处以私刑。	Rumors forwarded via social media, especially on WhatsApp, have led to mob lynchings of innocent people falsely accused of being cow slaughterers, child kidnappers, or worse.
这是因为，最初的平静时期常常以腐败堕落滋生以及革命目标的倒退为标志，导致理想主义者感到革命失去了方向。	This is because the initial quiet period is often marked by corruption and a retreat from revolutionary goals, leading idealists to feel that the revolution is losing its way.
杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）和沃尔特·白芝浩（Walter Bagehot）就是反对派阵营中的两大巨头。	Two notable holdouts are Jamie Dimon and Walter Bagehot.
在经过多年徒劳地试图和平解决争端，以及十几次根据谈判者的部署而推出的官方以及不公开渠道的和平计划后，能够创造性地达成协议的空间已经非常小了。	After years of frustrated attempts to reach a settlement, and with dozens of official and back-channel peace plans at the negotiators’ disposal, there remains little room for creativity in producing an agreement.
更为引人注目的模式是美国人对实际流动性较低的部分地区 — — 包括乔治亚，阿拉巴马，弗吉尼亚，北卡罗来纳和南卡罗来纳等东南部各州 — — 的社会流动性过于乐观。	An even more striking pattern is that Americans are overly optimistic about social mobility in parts of the country where actual mobility is low – including the southeastern states of Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
说到底，AI的未来（future of AI ） — —我们的AI未来（AI future ） — —是光明的。	Ultimately, the future of AI – our AI future – is bright.
加尔布雷斯观察到，占款私用（embezzlement）有一种性质，即“罪行犯下和发现之间会有几周、几个月或几年的时滞。	Embezzlement, Galbraith observed, has the property that “weeks, months, or years elapse between the commission of the crime and its discovery.
相反，俄罗斯是更典型的民族安全国家（National Security State ） ， 撩拨西方的焦虑以巩固其对乌克兰的控制，以官方民族主义镇压国内反对者。	Russia, by contrast, is a more classic National Security State, now playing Western anxieties like a fiddle to consolidate its tightening grip on Ukraine and suppress domestic opposition with a tide of official nationalism.
在这样的背景下，很难解释为何欧洲央行要继续坚持非常规货币政策措施 — — 比如负利率和不断地购买债券。	Against this background, it is difficult to explain why the ECB continues to insist that unconventional monetary-policy measures – such as negative rates and continued bond purchases – are needed.
我们只不过尚未具备足够的深刻洞察力去理解在一场遥远的变革 — — 不管是一场金融危机还是爆发式增长 — — 中所有的因素将如何互动。	We simply do not yet have sufficiently precise insights into how all of its elements interact during times of far-reaching change, whether it be a financial crisis or a growth spurt.
卡尔加里—当哈维·库欣（Harvey Cushing）和威廉·博威（William Bovie）于1926年引入电灼（用高频电流封闭血管或制造切口 ） ， 他们的创新改变了神经外科学。	CALGARY – When Harvey Cushing and William Bovie introduced electrocautery (which uses a high-frequency current to seal blood vessels or make incisions) in 1926, their innovation transformed neurosurgery.
1989年，在爱沙尼亚之旅中（当时爱沙尼亚仍是苏联的一部分 ） ， 我要的翻译 — — 一位兼职牙医带我去她的牙科诊所。	In 1989, during a trip to Estonia – then still a part of the Soviet Union – I asked my interpreter, a moonlighting dentist, to take me to her dental clinic.
我们不知道下一场危机何时发生，在哪里发生，但我们能知道它会发生 — — 并且我们必须在它发生时做出更好的准备。	We do not know when and where the next crisis will erupt, but we do know that it will – and that we must be better prepared when it does.
因此 ， 《 利维坦》由俄罗斯文化部拨出部分资金 — — 并且表示俄罗斯当局对赢得奥斯卡奖不感兴趣 — — 显得颇为讽刺。	So it is ironic that Leviathan was partly financed by Russia's culture ministry – and telling that the Russian authorities had no interest in its winning at the Oscars.
比如，如果实际发生在2012年初的伦敦鲸交易发生在2008年金融系统孱弱不堪时，JPM就会被网开一面。	The London Whale trades, for example, were from early 2012; had they occurred in 2008, when the financial system was fragile, JPM, it is said, would have gotten a legal pass.
我会尽快派遣一支欧洲开放社会计划需求评估团队到希腊与当局（及已经在帮助需要者的民众和组织）联系，以便制定一项能争取公众支持的计划。	As soon as possible, I will dispatch an OSIFE needs-assessment team to Greece to contact the authorities – and the people and organizations already helping the needy – to work out a plan for which we can generate public support.
毕竟，这项政策不是由国土安全部门制定的，而是由特朗普的首席战略顾问、自命为文化斗士的史蒂芬·班农（Stephen Bannon）制定的。	After all, the policy was designed not by the domestic security establishment, but by Trump’s chief strategist, the avowed culture warrior Stephen Bannon.
诺贝尔奖获得者、农学家布劳格（Norman Borlaug）用公共资金开发的新的“绿色革命”种子可以被世界各地的使用者免费获得。	The new “Green Revolution” seeds that the Nobel laureate agronomist Norman Borlaug developed with public money were freely available to all users anywhere.
我们的方法II的理性总是能够指向每个理性的个人都会同意的最优选择的��蒙观点，和多数 合理 选择这一广泛接受的现代观点相冲突。	The Enlightenment idea that our System-II rationality can always point to an optimal choice about which every reasonable individual would agree clashes with the widely accepted modern idea that there is a plurality of reasonable choices.
事实上，就在上周，福克斯新闻主播比尔·奥莱利尽管拥有美国最受欢迎的有线电视真人秀，但却依然失去了工作。 因为广告商面对团结一致的民众压力而迅速抛弃了他。	Indeed, just last week, the Fox News host Bill O’Reilly lost his job, despite having America’s most popular cable news show, when advertisers, facing concerted grassroots pressure, quickly deserted him.
最有效的征税方法之一是美国工资税，该税种的边际税率接近于平均税率（因为不存在减税，税率结构的累进性也较低 ） 。	One of the most efficient tax-raising methods is the US payroll tax, for which the marginal tax rate is close to the average rate (because deductions are absent and there is little graduation in the rate structure).
这就要求人们更加深入地理解技术驱动的结构变化，科技巨头要与政府同步理解并对其日益提升的系统重要性做出调整。	This demands deeper comprehension of technology-driven structural changes, with Big Tech recognizing and adjusting to its growing systemic importance in step with government.
自Facebook 和Twitter被曝光在2016年美国总统竞选期间起着传播假消息和炮制不信任和种族对立的关键作用以来，越来越多的人要求加强监管。	Since the revelations that Facebook and Twitter played a key role in disseminating false information and sowing mistrust and racial tension in the 2016 US election, a growing chorus has called for stricter regulations.
阿萨德政权将垂死挣扎转化为种族和宗派冲突的行径将对整个地区造成严重的破坏，而首当其冲受到影响的就是巴嫩和伊拉克等邻国。	The regime’s effort to turn its struggle for survival into an ethnic and sectarian conflict could wreak havoc across the region, starting with neighbors like Lebanon and Iraq.
中国政府不愿人民币快速升值可能是因为其厌恶不可预知的大幅波动，特别是在其准备将人民币推向国际储备货币地位的时候。	The Chinese government’s reluctance to allow faster exchange-rate appreciation may reflect its aversion to large, unforeseeable fluctuations, particularly given its determination to make the renminbi an international reserve currency.
全球化的受益者通常用促进新活动、有利于实体经济而不是金融的政策，以及强调高生产率就业的连续改革的战略来对全球化进行补充。	The beneficiaries of globalization are typically those countries that complemented it with a strategy to promote new activities, policies that favored the real economy over finance, and sequential reforms that emphasized high-productivity employment.
尽管传统上贸易被认为是决定汇率的主要因素，汇率涨跌通常被认为可以纠正一国的对外贸易失衡，但当今资本跨境流动规模已经非常庞大，它们对汇率的冲击比以前大很多 。	While trade is supposed to be the primary driver of exchange rates, which should rise or fall to correct countries’ external imbalances, capital flows have grown to the point that their role in guiding exchange rates is now much larger.
比方说非洲和印度乡下都有不少自行车维修点、报摊和小商店，可以对店主进行培训，让他们学会安装并维护这些系统。	For example, bicycle mechanics, who are plentiful in Africa and rural India, or small shop and kiosk owners could be trained to install and maintain these systems.
“伊拉克名单”在2010年3月的议会选举中赢得的席位最多，但其领导人，前总理伊亚德·阿拉维将不会再任旧职。	Iraqiya won the largest share of seats in the March 2010 parliamentary elections, yet its leader, former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, will not return to his old job.
这表明，尽管释放囚犯可以促成短期协议，但并没有带来旨在形成基于信任的、能带来持续和平的协议的真正努力。	This suggests that, while the prisoner release may lead to a short-term agreement, it is not backed by a genuine effort to develop the kind of trust-based arrangements that are needed for lasting peace.
如果发动袭击的主要理由是人道主义（结束对叙利亚平民的毫无意义的屠杀 ） ， 美国军事干预将弊大于利。	If the main justification for an attack is humanitarian – to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians – US military intervention would do more harm than good.
除了叙利亚，两大问题将决定新中东的未来：穆斯林兄弟会治下的埃及的道路以及伊朗核计划和地区角色图谋冲突的结果。	Along with Syria, two issues will determine this new Middle East’s future: Egypt’s path under the Muslim Brotherhood, and the outcome of confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program and regional role.
现在，我们可以发现一些对人类观察者来说不那么容易发现的新模式 — — 这已经为我们带来降低能源消费和二氧化碳排放的方法。	We can now find new patterns that are not readily evident to the human observer – and this already suggests ways to lower energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
日本要求其航空公司无视中国有关航班预先通知的要求，中国要求一切航班均需预先通知，即使这些航班只是途径新识别区，而不是飞往中国领空。	Japan has asked its airlines to ignore China’s demand for advance notification of flights, even if they are merely transiting the new zone and not heading toward Chinese territorial airspace.
这一次，美国十分愿意通过充分的合作来促进海地的经济发展：再发生一连串的事故只能引起混乱，包括大量新的难民流入美国。	This time, the US has a strong interest in cooperating fully to promote economic progress: another round of failure would only provoke chaos, including massive numbers of new refugees to the US.
但不妨换一个角度看待危机和我们的金融机构：金融系统距离悬崖边缘从未如此之远，即使是在2008年之前。 这是因为税收制度鼓励金融企业过度负债。	But consider another way of viewing the crisis and our financial institutions: the financial system was never all that far from the cliff’s edge, even before 2008, because the tax system encouraged financial firms to overload themselves with debt.
但满足民众安全需求所需的多数政策都超出了国家政府的能力范畴，特别是当这些政府自己还在想办法适应的时候。	But most of the policy responses needed to meet people’s demand for greater security are beyond the scope and reach of national governments, especially when these governments are trying to cope on their own.
中国领导人将中国对印度的不对称贸易关系 — — 出口比进口高五倍多 — — 视为破坏其对手的制造业基础，同时还能斩获可观的利润的战略武器。	Chinese leaders value the lopsided trade relationship with India – exports are more than five times higher than imports – as a strategic weapon to undercut its rival’s manufacturing base while reaping handsome profits.
丹佛 — — 从4月27日韩国总统文在寅和朝鲜总统金正恩举行最高首脑会晤以来，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普就一直不遗余力地想要证明自己才是朝韩外交背后的策划者，这一点丝毫也不出人意料。	DENVER – Since the April 27 summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump has sought, unsurprisingly, to portray himself as the mastermind behind inter-Korean diplomacy.
类似地，1987年至1993年巴勒斯坦第一次抵抗运动（Intifada）后，以色列国防界领导了和平努力。	Similarly, in the aftermath of the first Intifada, the Palestinian uprising that lasted from 1987 to 1993, the defense establishment led the effort for peace.
德国现在得求神拜佛，希望人们 — — 德国选民和中国基金管理者 — — 现在把这些承诺当真，又在十年后把它们忘掉。	The best hope for Germany is that people – both German voters and Chinese fund managers – will take such promises seriously now, but forget about them in ten years.
即使是他对缅甸的历史性访问 — — 他是第一个访问该国的美国总统 — — 对贸易的关注也将不亚于促使这个具有战略地理重要性的资源丰富国家摆脱中国的影响。	Even his historic visit to Myanmar – the first ever by a US president – is as much about trade as it is about weaning a strategically located, resource-rich country from Chinese influence.
阿富汗战争造成美军伤亡人数比前几场战争都要少，但人力成本仍然非常巨大 — — 特别是在考虑到阿富汗方面的伤亡后。	While the war in Afghanistan may have resulted in fewer American deaths and injuries than previous US wars, the human cost remains substantial – especially after factoring in Afghan deaths and injuries.
至于中国的银行，主要问题似乎是地方政府债务膨胀带来的，根据政府数据，截止2010年底的地方政府债务总值达1.7万亿美元（约占GDP30%的份额 ） 。	As for Chinese banks, the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local-government debt, which, according to the government, totaled $1.7 trillion (roughly 30% of GDP) at the end of 2010.
新的奥巴马政府提出了开支计划，其中赤字超过一万亿美元，这会创下新的纪录。 而这还是在刚离任的布什政府已经创下了有史以来的最高赤字之后。	The new Obama administration is proposing spending plans that would create a record US deficit of more than one trillion dollars – and this coming on top of the outgoing Bush administration’s record deficit.
这样对移民进行攻击或许能够带来一些即时的政治利益，但是最终结果必定会使社会分裂，而社会的凝聚力已经受到了经济危机严重影响。	Such attacks on immigration might offer some instant political gratification, but their net result is to cleave societies whose cohesion is already seriously challenged by the economic crisis.
去年乌克兰的经常帐户赤字约为GDP的8.3 % ， 导致其外汇储备不断减少，仅能维持两个月的进口所需。	Its current-account deficit last year was an estimated 8.3% of GDP, and its foreign-currency reserves are quickly being depleted, covering just over two months of imports.
诺贝尔经济学奖获得者阿玛蒂亚·森强调：大多数饥荒发生时粮食都并非真的紧缺，而是未能把粮食运到需要的人们手中，这在很大程度上是因为他们缺乏购买力。	The Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen has emphasized that most famines are associated not with a shortage of food, but the failure to get food to the people who need it, largely because they lack purchasing power.
过度储蓄又没有面临增加支出的市场压力的债权经济体，以及过度支出并面临市场压力、被迫增加储蓄的债务经济体，它们之间的不对称调整也放大了需求短缺。	So has the asymmetric adjustment between over-saving creditor economies that face no market pressure to spend more, and over-spending debtor economies that do face market pressure and have been forced to save more.
这种极端主义也正在缓慢但逐步地孕育着自己的反对力量，正如我们看到反伊斯兰政党在欧洲大选中逐渐得势，而欧洲领导人关于文化多元化的宣言都沦为废纸。	This extremism is, slowly but surely, producing its own reaction, as we see from Islamaphobic parties’ electoral gains in Europe, and statements by European leaders that multiculturalism has failed.
美国银行手上还有第三张合约（假设对手是贝尔斯登 ） ， 这张合约通过清算所进行，价值1亿美元，但亏损方是贝尔斯登。	BofA also has a contract with, say, Bear Stearns through the clearinghouse for $100 million, with Bear Stearns on the losing end.
他似乎更不会因为将其政府带入一场国际会议而与以色列交恶，就像他的父亲在1991年时与沙米尔总理之间那样。	Nor does he seem eager to open a rift with Israel by dragging its government to an international conference, the way his father did with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1991.
这时，约翰·斯诺（John Snow）挺身而出。 他是一位有开创精神的医生，直觉地认为霍乱不是如同传统智慧认为的那样通过空气传播，而是通过水传播。	Enter John Snow, a pioneering physician who had intuited that cholera was spread not through the air, as conventional wisdom held, but through water.
但随后它们“创建了国家，指定了统治者，划定了边境 ， （ 并引入了）国家制度 ” ， 但这并没有奏效。	But then they “created countries, nominated rulers, delineated frontiers, [and introduced] a state system” that would not work.
尽管它的资产翻了倍，达到3万多亿欧元（折合约4万亿美元 ） ， 欧洲已经在四年中第二次回落到衰退状态。	Despite a doubling of its balance sheet, to a little more than €3 trillion ($4 trillion), Europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years.
相反，基地组织的领导人仍固执地要在整个穆斯林世界建立极端伊斯兰统治，并不惜向一大批被认为是阻碍这一目标的国家宣战。	Al-Qaeda leaders, by contrast, remain wedded to the goal of establishing radical Islamist regimes throughout the Muslim world and waging war against a long list of governments that they see as hostile to this objective.
提高公众意识、改善卫生条件、改进监管方式等其余四诫也取得了某些进展，并大幅降低了农业抗生素的使用 — — 但这还远远不够。	There has been some progress on the remaining four Commandments – greater public awareness, improved sanitation, improved surveillance, and dramatically reduced usage of antibiotics in agriculture – but not enough.
但就目前而言，有关英国脱欧的政策 — — 无论是在英吉利海峡的哪一边 — — 都是市场友好型解决方案的绊脚石。	But, for now, the politics of Brexit – on both sides of the English Channel – are standing in the way of a market-friendly solution.
最后，法国前总统尼古拉·萨科齐（Nicolas Sarkozy）将得势，因为当今的欧元区是由一个由成员国政府首脑（极其财政部长）组成的事实上的经济政府所领导。	In the end, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has prevailed, because the eurozone today is led by a de facto economic government that comprises member countries’ heads of state and government (and their finance ministers).
看来，欧盟委员会酝酿开征金融交易税，背后就是这个想法。 欧洲的经济金融沉疴每况愈下，那便是它新开的药方。	That seems to be the thinking behind the European Commission’s proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) – the Commission’s latest response to Europe’s festering growth and financing problems.
因此，来自全世界的公共知识分子小组组成了国际公司税改革独立委员会（ICRICT ） ， 由我担任主席。	That is why a group of public intellectuals from around the world has created the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), which I chair.
我们目前这场革命始于20世纪60年代的硅谷，而且与摩尔定律密切相关：电脑芯片上的晶体管数量每两三年就会翻一番。	Our current revolution, which began in Silicon Valley in the 1960s, is bound up with Moore’s Law: the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles every couple of years.
几十年来，对于每项价值超过2亿美元的协议，卡扎菲都���自审阅，而且他往往会选择那些外国公司会接收合同的协议。	For decades, Qaddafi personally reviewed every agreement worth more than $200 million and often chose which foreign firms would receive contracts.
结果，与西欧的趋同之路有所放缓，许多国家将远远落后 — — 这一结果与2005年左右时所构想的愿景截然不同，当时，在一代人的时间里实现趋同看起来大有希望。	As a result, convergence with Western Europe could slow, with many countries lagging far behind – a far different outcome from that envisioned during the boom of the mid-2000s, when convergence within a generation seemed almost like a birthright.
就共和党人而言，他们分为传统的自由市场、自由贸易保守派和特朗普“经济民族主义者 ” ， 这些人希望限制移民和贸易，用以代替美国贸易伙伴所做出的让步。	For their part, the Republicans are divided between traditional free-market, free-trade conservatives and Trumpian “economic nationalists” who want to restrict immigration and trade in lieu of concessions by America’s trading partners.
甚至连土地和海洋的化学成分也发生着变化。 海水的酸性日益增强—进而威胁着珊瑚礁—就是二氧化碳含量增加的结果。	Even the chemistry of the land and ocean is changing, with the ocean becoming more acidic – thus threatening coral reefs – as a result of higher carbon dioxide.
意大利和法国的政治和经济弱势，以及英国的逐渐从欧盟事务中抽身凸显出德国在当前危机中捍卫欧元区的关键作用。	The political and economic weakness of France and Italy, together with Britain’s gradual withdrawal from EU affairs, highlight Germany’s key role in rescuing the eurozone from the current crisis.
如果我们只依赖双边协议，推动在困难的关键问题上达成共识的共同空间和协同将越来越窄直至消失，从气候变化到安全问题都是如此。	If we depend solely on bilateral deals, the shared spaces and synergies that facilitate agreement on difficult but vital topics – from climate change to security – will narrow until they disappear.
这一回，美联储依然是断然否认：2009年以来，如果不是QE压低了发达国家的利率，追逐收益率将不会导致新兴市场被短期“热”钱吞没。	It remains steeped in denial: Were it not for the interest-rate suppression that QE has imposed on developed countries since 2009, the search for yield would not have flooded emerging economies with short-term “hot” money.
更令人惊讶的是，哥本哈根政治家们自信地宣称，现在减排二氧化碳终将使这座城市及其居民更加富裕，化石燃料价格上涨后今天昂贵的绿色能源投资终将带来回报。	More surprisingly, Copenhagen’s politicians have confidently declared that cutting CO2 now will ultimately make the city and its citizens wealthier, with today’s expensive green-energy investments more than paying off when fossil-fuel prices rise.
去年签署的八国集团协定同意免除18个最贫困国家的债务¾这18个国家中的16个来自非洲，另外两个来自拉美。 这份协议开了个好头，但是还远远不够。	The G-8 countries’ agreement last year to a debt write-off for the 18 poorest states – 16 in Africa and two in Latin America – is a splendid, but insufficient, beginning.
而在其2027年全面实施时，它将增加大多数中间阶层美国人（位于收入分布中段的那60 % ） 的缴税额。	And, when fully implemented (in 2027), it will increase taxes on a majority of Americans in the middle (the second, third, and fourth quintiles).
但是，最近，欧洲大陆遇到了关于如何解决这一问题的意识形态僵局，环境可持续性和经济增长常常被描述为水火不容。	Lately, however, the continent has reached an ideological impasse over how to address the problem, with environmental sustainability and growth often portrayed as being mutually exclusive.
事实上，若不能在各层次同时实现高质量教育 — — 从学前教育直到大学或同等学力职业培训 — — 就实现包容增长模式就几乎无望。	Indeed, without high-quality education at all levels – from preschool through university or the equivalent professional training – it is nearly impossible to achieve inclusive growth patterns.
任何产品创新都需要一系列的创意，搞清它们对最终成果相对贡献其可能性可以说微乎其微，更不用说分清哪些是最新创意了。	The creation of any product requires many ideas, and sorting out their relative contribution to the outcome – let alone which ones are really new – can be nearly impossible.
不过，虽然聚变过程产生了一定能量（具体来讲是1，600万瓦特 ） ， 科学家们还没有成功完成能自我持续的核聚变“燃烧”过程。	But, while the fusion process has produced some power (16 million watts of it, to be specific), scientists have yet to create a self-sustaining fusion “burn.”
雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安的新当选政府那时就开始了一系列雄心勃勃的改革，以满足欧盟对其成员国的政治标准。	Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s newly elected government had embarked on a series of ambitious reforms to meet the European Union’s political criteria for membership.
"当被问及接受特奥·范霍赫采访时有何感想，欧盟执行委员鲍克斯坦说 ： "" 他直截了当是件好事；可莽撞无礼就不是了 。 """	"When asked what it was like to be interviewed by Theo van Gogh, European Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said, ""He was impertinent, and that is a good thing; he was offensive, and that is not."""
我们欧洲人可以划定我们自己的红线，警告俄罗斯，如果越线，我们将收紧对俄制裁，因为从此以后它将为其叙利亚附庸的罪行负责。	We in Europe can draw our own red line, warning Russia that, if the line is crossed, we will increase sanctions against it as a state henceforth held to be responsible for the crimes of its Syrian vassal.
一些出资人 — — 如法国、德国和欧洲投资银行 — — 正在游说经合组织发展援助委员会将无补贴贷款列为ODA，以使它们实现它们的ODA目标。	And some donors – such as France, Germany, and the European Investment Bank – are lobbying the OECD Development Assistance Committee to count unsubsidized loans as official development assistance to enable them to meet their ODA targets.
而且，在联合国气候谈判中，他们已经提出了全新的解决办法：一项名为减少因森林砍伐和森林退化而造成碳排放 （REDD+）的行动计划。	And, at UN climate talks, they have come up with a novel solution: an initiative called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
尽管北冰洋在夏天冰雪消融，但在一年中多数时候却都是冰雪覆盖，冰川融化所形成的冰山不仅越来越大，也越来越常见。	Even if the Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free in the summer, most of the year it is not, and icebergs from melting glaciers will become more common and possibly larger.
巴黎 — — 法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙将预定于2019年5月举行的欧洲议会选举认定为不光是传统右翼和左翼党派之间的斗争，还包括民粹主义者和像他自己一样的亲欧洲进步人士。	PARIS – French President Emmanuel Macron has framed the European Parliament election in May 2019 as a battle not between the traditional right and left, but between populists and pro-European progressives like himself.
一个软弱的过渡时期政府—或外来占领方的权力机构—不应该试图实施诸如国家资源私有化这样的政策，尤其在这样做可能引发政治对抗的情况下。	A weak interim national government – or a United Nations or foreign occupying administration – should not attempt to implement policies such as privatizing national resources when doing so might incite political resistance.
我们有理由去否定麦克阿斯基尔的决定，但我们同时也必须承认 — — 除非事情另有隐情 — — 他是被我们所能实践的某种最崇高的价值所感召。	We can reasonably disagree with MacAskill’s decision, but we should acknowledge that – unless there is more going on than appears on the surface – he was motivated by some of the finest values we are capable of exercising.
欧盟各国对高敏感度情报以及治安信息的交流程度堪称前所未有，并因此在确保高度法制和民主的同时提升了公共安全。	EU member states share highly sensitive intelligence and police information as never before, thereby increasing public security while upholding world-class legal and democratic standards.
但是，更有可能的是，在经历了多年的缓慢复苏后，美国经济也许终于已经准备好大步向前了，至少可以维持一段时间。	Still, it is far more likely that after years of slow recovery, the US economy might at last be ready to move significantly faster, at least for a while.
不出意料，在整个社会都承受着空前经济压力时央行竟敢公开出手援助特定金融机构，很快就令央行独立性这个概念成为了政治雷区。	Not surprisingly, the notion of independence for central banks that visibly aided specific financial institutions – and this at a time when society as a whole was under unprecedented economic stress – quickly became politically toxic.
虽然将萨科齐比做通敌卖国的马绍尔·贝当维希政权显然是有点夸张，但罗卡尔的忧虑也是许多法国人的感受 — — 而且不仅限于知识分子和权威专家。	Equating Sarkozy with Marshal Pétain’s collaborationist Vichy regime is, of course, an exaggeration, but Rocard’s concerns are shared by many French – and not only intellectuals and pundits.
因此，禁止同性恋行为的根本问题不在于国家用法律来实行某种道德观，而在于该法律是建立在认为同性恋不道德的错误观点之上。	The underlying problem with prohibiting homosexual acts, then, is not that the state is using the law to enforce private morality. It is that the law is based on the mistaken view that homosexuality is immoral.
要在不同文化的国家之间进行对比会比较困难，但是同样的结果也出现在一个国家的内部，除开那些极低收入水平的人，比如在美国年收入低于12000美元的人。	Comparisons between countries with different cultures are difficult, but the same effect appears within countries, except at very low income levels, such as below $12,000 annually for the US.
另一个重要性下降的政策领域是内部市场 — — 这是一个值得关注的决定，因为自1958年欧盟成立以来，它一直是欧洲工程的核心。	Another policy area that has lost its centrality is the internal market – a notable decision, given that it has been the centerpiece of the European project since the Commission was created in 1958.
欧盟或许已经在走下坡路，但基辅独立广场（Maidan Square）的壮观景象有力地提醒我们，欧洲的核心价值仍具有吸引力。	The shine may have come off the EU, but the gripping scenes from Kyiv’s Maidan Square are a powerful reminder of the enduring appeal of Europe’s core values.
这种方式已经在当地的非暴力抵抗运动中得以显现，同样体现这一新潮流的还有国际社会施压以色列的抵制、撤资和制裁运动（BDS ） 。	Such an approach has been exemplified in local non-violent resistance movements, as well as the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement to pressure Israel at the international level.
该机构2009年脱胎自昔日的金融稳定性论坛，基本上没有任何权力，也没有正式地位，直到最近才成为独立法律实体。	That body, which emerged from the old Financial Stability Forum in 2009 with few powers and no formal status, has only recently become a separate legal entity.
不，无论我们是否愿意承认，真正的区别是中共政府成功地将其人口中的很大一部分全球化了，远远超过印度民主政府所达到的水平。	No, the real difference – whether we like to admit it or not – is that China’s communist government has succeeded in globalizing a much larger share of its population than India’s democratic government has managed to do.
金融系统变得更为集中，导致银行问题进一步恶化 — — 它们不仅规模太大，关联和联系太紧密以致无法任由其破产，而且更加难以管理和对公众负责。	The financial system has become even more concentrated, exacerbating the problem of banks that are not only too big, too interconnected, and too correlated to fail, but that are also too big to manage and be held accountable.
风险已经改变 — — 并且已经从银行系统转移出去 — — 因此监管者和监督者必须采取行动，将注意力扩大到银行之外。	Because risks have morphed – and migrated out of the banking system – regulators and supervisors will have to step up their efforts and widen their focus to see beyond the banks.
在“经济和就业”类的前十大观点中有三个与增加大银行约束有关 — — 而对于“拆分花旗集团 ” （ Break Up Citigroup）的支持更是急剧增加（充分披露：该主题由我建议该网站列出 ） 。	Three of the top ten ideas under “Economy & Jobs” are about imposing greater constraints on the big banks – and there is a sharp upward trend in support for Break Up Citigroup (full disclosure: I suggested this item for the website).
它们似乎想要先把私人部门吓怕，这样一来，在财政大斧头真正砍下来的时候，消费者和投资者才会相信大难已经避免，从而增加支出。	It as if they are trying to terrorize the private sector, so that when the fiscal ax actually falls, consumers and investors will be sufficiently relieved that disaster has been averted that they will increase spending.
无论如何，美国应该强力领导世界的前提建立在这样的观点上：没有仁慈的超级霸权充当世界警察，世界就会陷入混乱，就会有邪恶势力主宰世界。	Either way, the premise that the US should lead forcefully rests on the idea that without a benevolent hegemonic power to police the world, chaos will ensue and more malevolent forces will take over.
萨普的回答可能不是最聪明的，但是如果评委对印度人是多么渴望在体育上取得成功有任何的了解的话，他们就会明白她不是在表达一个很荒谬的要务。	Sapre’s answer might not have been the brightest, but if the judges had any idea of how desperate Indians are for sporting success, they would have understood that she was not expressing such an absurd priority.
当前，有人将危机和日本20世纪90年代的经历进行对比 — — 这是日本“失去的十年 ” ， 在经济方面它也削弱了日本执政的自民党的正当性。	Currently, parallels are being drawn to Japan’s experience in the 1990’s – a “lost decade” in economic terms that also undermined the legitimacy of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
就目前而言，奥巴马依然深陷在美国国内卫生法案的政治斗争当中难以自拔，而且也难以及时地为即将给京都议定书制定后续协议的哥本哈根峰会做点什么。	Obama is still fighting back home for his healthcare initiative, and is hamstrung from acting on climate change in time for the Copenhagen summit, which is to agree on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol.
自2012年成立Rappler以来，路易萨的网站已经公开了与杜特尔特总统“禁毒战”法外处决信息有关的大量宝贵资料。	Since founding Rappler in 2012, Ressa’s website has become an invaluable source of information about the extrajudicial killings linked to President Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs.”
宏观经济行为的结构主义视角引出了一个被称为“自然”失业率的概念。 这个概念借用两次世界大战期间在欧洲出现的“自然”利率的概念。	The structuralist perspective on macroeconomic behavior led to the concept that came to be called the “natural” rate of unemployment, borrowing from the notion, which arose in Europe during the interwar years, of a “natural” interest rate.
有几个国家已经开始推行强调预防和治疗而非打击的政策 — — 并将重点放到真正的敌人身上，那就是有组织犯罪。	Several countries are pursuing policies that emphasize prevention and treatment rather than repression – and refocusing their repressive measures on fighting the real enemy: organized crime.
事实上，这场尤先科和特莫申科领导的和平革命提醒了我们基辅在被迫让路给专制的莫斯科之前文明发展到多么高的程度。	Indeed, that peaceful revolution, led by Viktor Yushchenko and Yuliya Tymoshenko, was a reminder of how enlightened Kievan Rus had been before it was forced to give way to the despotic princes of Moscow.
在蒂勒森漫长的国际交易经验中 — — 这和外交并不是一回事 — — 他与俄罗斯总统普京建立了紧密的关系，而特朗普对普京的太对相当“软 ” 。	In his extensive international deal-making – which isn’t the same as diplomacy – Tillerson has developed a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, toward whom Trump has been notably soft.
这一新管道包围乌克兰、波兰当然还有波罗地海三国，将会为俄罗斯在寻求地区影响力的过程中提供更大的手段。	By circumventing Ukraine, Poland, and of course, the Baltic countries, the new pipeline promises greater leverage to the Kremlin as it seeks to reassert itself regionally.
当中国的高速工业发展提升了对德国传统出口需求的同时，欧元也为德国在欧洲南部地区创造了极为蓬勃的外部需求。	Until recently, the euro also provided booming external demand in southern Europe, while China’s breakneck industrial development raised demand for Germany’s traditional exports.
从工业革命到现在，西方的发展一直没有受到任何环境方面的约束，因此新兴国家认为，调整成本不应该由它们来承担。	From the Industrial Revolution until very recently, the West’s development was free of any environmental restrictions, and the emerging countries believe that they should not have to bear the adjustment cost.
2008年，美联储与十个发达经济体的中央银行建立了货币互换机制，其中包括欧元区，英国，日本，瑞士，和四个新兴经济体（巴西，韩国，墨西哥，新加坡 ） 。	In 2008, the Fed established currency-swap lines with the central banks of ten developed economies, including the eurozone, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland, and four emerging economies (Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, and Singapore).
同样令人恐怖的是，最严重的迫害对准了耶西迪人（Yedizi，与库尔德人一起生活的古老宗教群体 ） 。	As terrible as all of this is, the worst of the persecution has been aimed at the Yezidi, an ancient religious group that lives among the Kurds.
理查德·尼克松就是一个最好的例子，虽然他从来没有表达过对犹太人的好感，但不用质疑，在他的执政时期，以色列仍然是白宫最坚定的盟友。	That was clearly the case with Richard Nixon, who never suffered from an excess of love for Jews, but was nonetheless one of the staunchest allies that Israel ever had in the White House.
世界反兴奋剂机构（WADA）早在2003年就禁止使用基因兴奋剂，但有些科学家仍然认为，滥用基因兴奋剂的情况很可能会在2008年北京奥运会中出现。	The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibited gene doping in 2003, but some scientists predict that its misuse in sport is likely to appear at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.
意大利和西班牙政府指出，它们的高借贷成本基本上是兑换风险的反映，欧洲央行应该采取一切必要手段纠正这一问题。	The Italian and Spanish governments argue that their high borrowing costs largely reflect convertibility risks, and that the ECB should do as much as necessary to address them.
事实上，中国经济的真实状况早已无法摸透，但因目前更严厉的监管而暴露出来 — — 比如将人民币的投机交易粉饰成贸易支付。	In fact, the Chinese economy’s true condition had long been obscured, but has now been exposed by more stringent regulation of activities such as speculative trading of the renminbi masquerading as trade payments.
该国经济实际是权贵资本主义的一个变种，经济成功并非来自于孕育了自由的自由市场竞争，而是取决于谁在政界有“关系 ” 。	Its economy is a variant of crony capitalism, in which economic success depends on one’s political connections, rather than on the meritocratic free-market competition from which liberty grows.
发自纽黑文 — — 最近出现的全球经济走弱迹象令许多人开始思考未来几年的恶劣经济表现究竟会蔓延到何种地步。	NEW HAVEN – Recent indications of a weakening global economy have led many people to wonder how pervasive poor economic performance will be in the coming years.
法国评论员赫尔·加文（Hervé Juvin）在他2005年的黑马作品《身体的起源》中赞扬了这种新态度。	The French commentator Hervé Juvin extolled this new attitude towards the body in his 2005 surprise bestseller, L’avènement du corps (The Coming of the Body) .
而这类结构性变革有时会同时具备得益和破坏的双重属性，对此政策制定者们一直以来都奋力想在抽象的开放原则和具体措施之间找寻平衡，以避免变革所导致的最恶劣影响。	Structural change can be simultaneously beneficial and disruptive. And policymakers have long had to strike a balance between the abstract principle of openness and concrete measures to limit the worst effects of change.
这一在2005年联合国大会一致通过的原则在其他地区都能良好地贯彻，包括支持2008年对肯尼亚的外交干预。	That principle, unanimously agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2005, has been successfully invoked elsewhere, including in support of diplomatic intervention in Kenya in 2008.
这在推高了美元价值的同时也长期削弱了美国的出口竞争力，正如伦敦金融城提供的金融产品在对其欧盟成员国资格毫无异议的年代里推高了英镑，打击了英国出口那样。	This has driven up the dollar’s value and chronically undermined export competitiveness, much like the financial products offered by the City of London did in the UK by fueling sterling appreciation in the years of undisputed EU membership.
说服大国销毁核武器或许看上去就像让美国国会通过枪支管制法一样在政治上想入非非，但在这个问题上，奥巴马已经明确表示自己愿意尝试。	Convincing great powers to eliminate their nuclear arsenals might seem as politically fanciful as pushing gun-control legislation through the US Congress, but on that issue, too, Obama has made clear that he is willing to try.
如果一项政策能大大提振国内经济，给外国带来的负面溢出效应只是暂时的，那么也应该获得绿灯（这项政策对外国经济也是有益的，因为最终本国经济的进口需求将得到提振 ） 。	A policy could also be green if it jump-starts the home economy with only temporary negative spillovers for the foreign economy (the policy will still be good for the foreign economy by eventually boosting the home economy’s demand for imports).
索马里兰可以算做盟友之一，这个国家以前曾是英国的保护国，1991年从索马里独立，位于埃塞俄比亚的东北部。	One such ally could be Somaliland, the former British protectorate, which broke away from Somalia in 1991 and lies to the northeast of Ethiopia.
香港 — — 世界领导人将于本周末的法国戛纳G20峰会上聚首，而他们将面临的下一个经济雷区已经浮现在了眼前。	HONG KONG – With world leaders meeting at the end of this week at the G-20 summit in Cannes, France, the next economic minefield that they will face is already coming into view.
比如，埃及新旧军事统治者认定，美国的批评可以忽略，因为出于地缘政治原因，美国不可能取消对埃及的援助。	Egypt’s old-new military rulers, for example, have concluded that American criticism can be ignored, because America cannot cut off its aid to Egypt for geopolitical reasons.
但在长期，它可能减少美国就业，缩小北美占全球市场的比例，并破坏美国在国际贸易问题上的信誉 — — 与此同时也无法降低美国经常项目赤字。	But in the long run, it will likely reduce US employment, shrink North America’s share of the global auto market, and undermine America’s credibility on international trade issues – all while failing to reduce the US current-account deficit.
从更广的角度，尽管我的祖国身处千钧一发之势，但乌克兰应该获得清晰的路线图走出当前的安全“灰色地带 ” ， 走向欧洲-大西洋未来。	"More broadly, despite the highly charged situation in our country, Ukraine deserves a clear road map out of its current security “grey zone"" and toward a Euro-Atlantic future."
我知道民主的辉煌时代曾被践踏，1956年在布达佩斯，1968年在布拉格，以及1989年在天安门广场。	I know that stirrings of democracy have been crushed before: in Budapest in 1956, Prague in 1968, and in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
小学和中学的努力有助于在女生中培养更多样化的兴趣，让有才华的年轻女性获得她们所需要的工具，在关键经济部门做出重要贡献。	Efforts by primary and secondary schools could help to foster more diverse interests among female students, giving talented young women the tools they need to make important contributions to key economic sectors.
要说谁懂得行胜于言的道理，那一定是普京 — — 他经常断然否认证据确凿的坏事，比如干预美国选举和违反条约。	If anyone knows that actions speak louder than words, it is Putin, whose words often include transparent denials of documented wrongdoing, from meddling in the US election to violating treaties.
但是，为了赢得美国的重视，欧盟需要拿出设计完善而且资源配置合理的方案，而不是随随便便地提出27条不成熟的想法。	But, in order to be taken seriously by the US, the EU needs to bring well-developed, well-resourced policies to the table, rather than 27 half-baked ideas.
在侍从军官行刺企图失败后，达迪斯·卡马拉逃往国外，接替他的临时军政府领袖赛古巴·科纳特将军允许反对党任命一位平民总理。	Following an assassination attempt by an aide-de-camp, Dadis Camara fled the country, and the interim junta leader, General Sékouba Konaté, allowed the opposition political parties to appoint a civilian prime minister.
回顾他的一生，阿拉法特从未真正改变过自己的信仰：那就是把不惜一切手段毁灭以色列，代之以巴勒斯坦阿拉伯国家当作自己的终身目标。	Looking back at his career, Arafat never really veered from the belief that his life's mission was to destroy Israel by any means necessary and replace it with a Palestinian Arab state.
鉴于会议内容往往要临场确定，要确保有限度营销确实存在一定难度；发言人可能会出人意料地利用讲台宣传某种产品，这么做可能导致他/她被从今后的邀请名单上排除。	Given that the content is being created in real time, this can be challenging; a speaker may unexpectedly use the stage to promote a product, in which case he or she would probably not be invited back.
更世俗的真理是，昔日维持伊斯兰世界和平的是奥斯曼、不列颠和法兰西帝国，在它们分崩离析后，一直没有稳定的继任者产生。	The more mundane truth is that there have never been any stable successors to the defunct Ottoman, British, and French empires that used to keep the peace in the Islamic world.
En outre, même si la Commission européenne a clairement le devoir de d’empêcher la mauvaise gestion et la fraude, il se trouve que chaque demande de financement de l’UE demande des procédures extrêmement onéreuses.	Moreover, although the European Commission clearly has a duty to prevent mismanagement and fraud, every application for EU funding requires extremely onerous procedures.
如果说斯大林的道德记录有什么“模糊不清”的地方，可能是共产主义于我们的崇高目标 — — 人人平等、终结贫穷 — — 有共鸣之处。	If there is any “ambiguity” about Stalin’s moral record, it may be because communism strikes a chord with some of our nobler impulses, seeking equality for all and an end to poverty.
然而，即使许多公正和发展党的激进分子和选民都是虔诚的穆斯林，埃尔多安和居尔仍然致力于加入欧洲的一体化。	Yet, even if many AKP activists and voters are devout Muslims, Erdogan and Gul remain committed to European integration.
随着全球经济增长回暖以及某些地缘政治不确定性的出现（可能会限制一些产油国的产量 ） ， 目前油价已回升至每桶60美元以上。	With the pickup in global growth and the emergence of geopolitical uncertainties (which could constrain output in some oil-producing countries), oil prices have rebounded to above $60 per barrel.
该办法既更加累进，也更加有效：资本是高度流动的，因此从公民个人和股东居民头上征税要比从跨国公司头上征税容易得多。	It is both more progressive and more effective: with highly mobile capital, it is far easier to collect taxes from individual citizens and resident shareholders than from multinational companies.
在法国和阿拉伯国家关系方面，可以肯定地说，奥朗德同意奥巴马2009年开罗演讲的提倡包容（pro-engagement）的观点。	With regard to relations between France and the Arab world, one can be certain that Hollande would agree with the pro-engagement thrust of Obama’s 2009 Cairo speech.
我们应该停止愚蠢的害怕，停止追寻愚蠢的政策并且开始投资于长远的、聪明的研发项目。 “反人类罪”的指责必须停止。	We have to stop being scared silly, stop pursuing stupid policies, and start investing in smart long-term R&D. Accusations of “crimes against humanity” must cease.
如果观察员能体会言外之意并大量观察那些没有按照本来面目表述的东西，下任美国总统外交策的观点可以看清楚了。	Aspects of the next president’s foreign policy are there to see if observers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is.
这一可能性大小是一个连续变量，从比如O（可恶的压迫性独裁统治）直到W（管理良好、功能完善的民主 ） 。	The scale would be continuous, going from, say, O (odious repressive dictatorships) to W (well-managed and fully functioning democracies).
约旦与以色列签署的和平条约的第三和第八条款明确将难民问题作为一个主要的亟需解决的问题，同时还引证了越国界管理和耶路撒冷未解决的状况。	Articles 3 and 8 of Jordan’s peace treaty with Israel refer explicitly to the refugee problem as one of the major issues still to be resolved, as well as citing the unresolved status of trans-border arrangements and of Jerusalem.
爱尔兰在成为欧盟成员国的35年内几乎享受了不成比例的好处，到了2008年时还从欧盟预算中净赚了5亿欧元。	Ireland has benefited disproportionately from EU largesse during its 35 years of membership, and, in 2008, was still receiving a net sum of €500 million from the EU budget.
长期以来，沙特阿拉伯通过向臣民发放巨额石油财富，以及在沙特社会推行基于严格的瓦哈比派传统的原教旨伊斯兰教保持（相对）内部稳定。	Saudi Arabia has long maintained (relative) internal stability by spreading its enormous oil wealth among its subjects, and by imposing on Saudi society fundamentalist Islamic doctrines based on the austere Wahhabi tradition.
伊丽莎白女王二世有过著名的一问：经济学家为何不能预见灾难？ 她或许要求太高了些，但一个众人皆有的感觉是经济学家的研究有很多属于“无厘头 ” 。	Queen Elizabeth II may have expected too much when she famously asked why economists had failed to foresee the disaster, but there is a widespread sense that much of their research turned out to be irrelevant.
库普乾认为，外交才是战略融合和互信的基本要素，而具有相似社会秩序和民族成分的国家间更容易建立和谐的外交关系。	Rather, he regards diplomatic engagement as the essential element to strategic accommodation and mutual trust, and this is more easily accomplished if the states have similar social orders and ethnicities.
如果欧洲领导人认真对待COP21承诺，就应该在2030年在2010年消费水平的基础上减少70 % ， 这一目标比欧洲理事会2014年的目标宏大一倍。	If European leaders are serious about their COP21 commitment, they should embrace a 70% reduction on 2010 consumption levels by 2030 – more than double the European Council’s 2014 target.
分离主义分子重提18世纪英国的暴行，并称苏格兰可以借此保有全部的北海石油储量，并且不再分担英国的债务。	The secessionists hark back to eighteenth-century English brutality and claim that Scotland will be able to keep all of its North Sea oil and shed its share of the UK’s debt.
这导致那些赤字国家只能通过通货紧缩的方式来调整实际汇率 — — 但这会引发公共和私人负债持续上升，最终导致大规模的信用违约	This is forcing deficit countries into real exchange-rate adjustments via deflation – and thus a rising burden of public and private debt that may lead to disorderly defaults.
举例来讲，二十世纪七十年代秘鲁批准安第斯山脉民众有权使用驼羊毛挽救了濒于灭绝的驼羊并为当地民众创造了长期的新的收入流。	For example, in the 1970s when Peru granted Andean communities the right to use vicuña wool, it saved the vicuña from extinction and created new, long-term income streams for the community.
真正的原因在于新闻审查制度，这场爆炸其实正代表了亚美尼亚匿影藏形的反新闻界集团对新闻界发起的最新攻击。	But the real problem is censorship, for the explosion was but the latest offensive in Armenia’s hidden war against the press.
因为全球教育合作机构的资助，从2002到2014年间发展中国家接受小学教育的女童增加了3，800万人。	Thanks to GPE funding, an additional 38 million girls in developing countries were enrolled in primary school from 2002 to 2014.
如果风险资本家蒂姆·德拉珀（Tim Draper）将加利福尼亚分成六个州的错误计划成功，硅谷将是美国最富有的州，而中央山谷将是最贫穷的州。	If the venture capitalist Tim Draper had succeeded in his misguided initiative to divide California into six states, Silicon Valley would have become the richest state in the US, and the Central Valley the poorest.
诚然，特朗普和其他民粹主义者经常试图通过声称集会中有“危机演员”或“付费积极分子”来诋毁真正的抗议活动。	True, Trump and other populists often try to discredit bona fide protests by claiming that they are stocked with “crisis actors” or “paid activists.”
主角一步步向地下贩毒网堕落的过程被描写得极为详尽，在此过程中，他所作出的每一个决定几乎都是十分理性的。	The main protagonist’s step-by-step descent into the drug underworld unfolds with such subtlety that each individual decision he makes along the way seems almost reasonable.
最后，药物进入市场，也必须对其进行严格跟踪，因为许多不良反应要经过众多病人多年的使用之后才能被发现。	Finally, the drug reaches the market, where it must be followed closely, because many adverse reactions are detected only with a large number of patients and after years of use.
逆转这一趋势在银行联盟的三大关键要素���—共同监管者、共同存款保险和共同清算基金 — — 都切实具备之前是不可能的。	Reversal of that process will likely not occur until the three key elements of banking union – common supervision, common deposit insurance, and a common resolution fund – are within tangible reach.
中国对日本处于美国保护之下的状态相对感到满意，因为它担心另一种情况：一个扩展其独立军事影响力的日本。	It is relatively content with Japan being a US security protectorate, because it fears the alternative: a Japan that expands its independent military reach.
同样可能被视为作弊的还有要求以技术转让换取市场准入、偏向于国内实体的公共采购、接受不安全的工作环境及剥削性的劳动行为，还有汇率操纵。	So may requiring technology transfer in exchange for market access, public procurement favoring domestic entities, acceptance of unsafe work environments and exploitative labor practices, and exchange-rate manipulation.
最近围绕世界银行行长Paul Wolfowitz辞职的纷扰凸现了推进世行良好治理和反腐败议程的必要性。	The recent turbulence surrounding the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz from the Presidency of the World Bank has underscored the need to push ahead with the Bank’s good governance and anti-corruption agenda.
一般认为俄乌两国之所以不愿做为，是因为两国政府都将注射吸毒者视为罪犯而非需要救治的病人，因此宁愿让这些人自生自灭。	The popular explanation for lack of action in Russia and Ukraine is that their governments view IDUs as criminals, rather than people with a disease, and adopt an informal let-them-rot policy.
我们还可以认为这些措施会在2013年1月结束，届时将会有新动作，抛出新措施的既可能是连任的奥巴马，也可能是新的共和党总统。	And we can assume that it would be repealed and replaced by something else come January 2013, either by a re-elected President Barack Obama, or by a new, Republican president.
事实上，两项著名的纵向研究 — — 马萨诸塞州的弗莱明汉姆心脏研究（Framingham Heart Study）和瑞典的国王岛项目（Kungsholmen Project）在阿尔茨海默症的预测方面获得了重要进展。	In fact, two famous longitudinal studies – the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts and the Kungsholmen Project in Sweden – have led to important progress in predicting the disease.
今天，将俄国和中国联系在一起的已经不仅仅是两国的能源协议，这两个国家都认定，属于他们的时代已经到来。 世界需要他们更甚于他们需要世界，而美国尤其如此。	Russia and China today are united not only by their energy deals, but also by both countries’ conviction that their time has come, and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world, particularly the US.
尽管报告对国际合作这一方向持首肯态度，但它违反了国际共识，增加了不可逆转的基因改变风险和新的不平等形式。	Although the report nods in the direction of international cooperation, it breaches an international consensus in a way that increases the risks of irreversible genetic alterations and new forms of inequality.
巴方已经满足了以方以及国际社会提出的所有安全要求，而在两国方案上言而无信的内塔尼亚胡政府却依然不愿划定本方边界。	Palestinians complied with all Israeli and international requirements for security, while Binyamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government, which gives lip-service to the two-state solution, has yet to elucidate where Israel’s borders will be.
去年12月，公诉人指控萨哈罗夫博物馆的两名官员和三名展览组织者煽动宗教仇恨，他们面临长达5年的牢狱生涯。	Last December, prosecutors charged two Sakharov Museum officials and three of the exhibition's organizers with inciting religious hatred. They now face prison terms of up to five years.
在美国和许多欧洲国家，平均工资停滞不前，尽管从GDP和就业增长角度看，大部分经济体已经从2008年金融危机中复苏。	In the United States and many European countries, average salaries have stagnated, despite most economies having recovered from the 2008 financial crisis in terms of GDP and job growth.
过去10年来肺结核发病数的年下降率仅有1.65 % ； 而2014年一年，肺结核就夺去了150万人的生命。	The annual decline in cases over the past decade has been a mere 1.65%; in 2014, TB killed 1.5 million people.
所有非洲开发银行支持的废水管理系统都遵循可持续发展原则，以确保能提高经济收益、惠及当地社会并让当地民众负担得起相应的费用。	All AfDB-supported wastewater-management systems follow sustainability strategies to ensure that they enhance economic gains, benefit local communities, and remain affordable.
印度人民党假装这是一次中立行动，哪怕在因甄别“外国人”而额首相庆的同时，仍然强调整个过程都接受最高法院的监督。	The BJP pretends that this is a neutral exercise, emphasizing that the Supreme Court supervised the process, even as it celebrates the identification of “foreigners.”
斯堪的纳维亚人早就想通了这一点：它是维持一个开放社会 — — 全球化和技术变革开放 — — 的社会契约的一部分。	The Scandinavians figured this out long ago; it was part of the social contract that maintained an open society – open to globalization and changes in technology.
堪培拉 — — 当美国总统唐纳德·特朗普突然取消与朝鲜领导人金正恩的首脑会晤，他将原因归咎于朝鲜的公开敌意和巨大愤怒。	CANBERRA – When US President Donald Trump abruptly canceled his summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, he blamed “tremendous anger and open hostility” from the North.
最后，该赌注认为石油出口国 — — 如尼日利亚、委内瑞拉，特别还有俄罗斯 — — 将成功避免经济崩溃，即使全球油价暴跌。	Finally, the bet assumes that oil-exporting countries like Nigeria, Venezuela, and especially Russia will fend off economic implosion, even as global oil prices plummet.
即使是在言论自由受到严格保护的美国，此类煽动性言论也会遭到起诉和严惩，只要它与暴力和其他非法行为扯上关系。	Even in the US, where freedom of expression is zealously protected, such incitement may be prosecuted and punished in circumstances in which violence or other unlawful behavior is imminent.
如今，像伊斯兰国和尼日利亚博科圣地这样的组织已经加入了基地组织的队伍，诱惑世界各地的穆斯林民众，从而确保对全球圣战运动的领导。	Today, groups like the Islamic State and Nigeria’s Boko Haram have joined Al Qaeda in a struggle to attract Muslims from all over the world, thereby securing their leadership in global jihad.
事实上，福岛第一核电站防护海塘遇袭之后几小时甚至几天内所发生的事情尽管令人震惊，却称得上是核电安全性的一次有力证明。	In fact, although what happened was shocking, the events in the hours and days after a giant wave slammed over the nuclear plant’s protective seawall might be interpreted as a remarkable testament to nuclear power’s sound credentials.
雅典 — — “希腊有史以来代价最昂贵的局部政府改组 ” ， 这至少是形容9月20日希腊大选结果的一种方式。	ATHENS – “The costliest minor government reshuffle in Greece’s history.” That is at least one way to describe the result of the Greek general election on September 20.
但没有伊朗的联盟实际已成为逊尼派阵线，伊朗本应参与谈判并在平息叙利亚内战中发挥更显著的作用。 但这一切的前提是伊朗愿意签署协议控制其核计划。	Iran, without which the coalition essentially becomes a Sunni front, can have a place at the table – and play a large and overt role in resolving the Syrian civil war – but only if it is willing to reach a deal to rein in its nuclear program.
多数历史学家都认为恐怖的伊凡名副其实；他不仅杀害了他的儿子和其他亲属，还下令执行1565到1572年令俄国陷入恐怖氛围的由国家主导的清洗运动（oprichnina ） 。	Most historians agree that Ivan lived up to his name; not only did he kill his son and other relatives, he also ordered the oprichnina, the state-led purges that terrorized Russia from 1565 to 1572.
现在去岛上希腊塞浦路斯聚居地参观的人不会再看到难民营：成百上千万的游客多数都不会想到，他们碰到超过三分之一的希腊塞浦路斯人或者是难民、或者是难民的后裔。	Anyone visiting the Greek Cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps: most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the Greek Cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees.
发展中国家目前面临更高的通胀率并非是因为宏观管理不善，而是由于石油和食品价格在窜升。 与富国相比，这些项目在平均家庭预算中占据更大的比例。	Developing countries currently face higher rates of inflation not because of poorer macro-management, but because oil and food prices are soaring, and these items represent a much larger share of the average household budget than in rich countries.
这一在人类帮助下发生的新演化意味着在人类世，我们其实既是旧生物多样性的毁灭者，也是新生物多样性的创造者。	This evolution of new human-associated species means that, in the Anthropocene, we are effectively creators of new biological diversity as well as destroyers of the old.
但如今运用到现代经济领域，这样的赞美在现实中至少是尴尬的：现代经济靠几家央行堆积如山的巨额债务来稳定金融系统。	But, applied to the modern economy, such praise is awkward at best, because it is literally true: the financial system was stabilized by piling huge volumes of debt into a few central banks.
但是我们目前面临的大规模的经常项目不平衡带来的风险之一就是政客可能会指责别的国家，采取保护主义政策。	But one of the risks associated with the large current-account imbalances we now face is that politicians may decide to blame one or another country and espouse protectionist policies.
举例来说，斯堪的那维亚国家、地中海国家以及像爱尔兰和英国那样的“自由的大西洋国家”之间的差别在某些时候要比欧洲整体和美国之间的差别还要大。	The differences for instance between the Scandinavian countries, the Mediterranean countries, and the “liberal Atlantic countries” like Ireland and the UK are sometimes more pronounced than those between Europe as a whole and the US.
正如接受治疗的大鼠的行为不再那么拘谨（更加能够忍受明亮开放的空间 ） ， 接受治疗的焦虑患者也更有可能能够回到工作岗位中。	Just as medicated rats are less behaviorally inhibited (more able to tolerate bright, open spaces), medicated anxiety sufferers are more likely to be able to return to their jobs.
这一模式或许也可以用于政治关系：赫希曼曾写过一篇著名文章，证明了在1989年退出东德的可行性是如何导致忠诚突然崩溃的。	The schema might also be applied to political relations: Hirschman wrote a memorable article showing how the ability to exit East Germany in 1989 produced a sudden breakdown of loyalty.
不论在国内还是国外，分离（disconnect）的现象严重，这给“中国因素”对脆弱世界的影响增加了新的风险维度。	On both counts, the disconnects are striking, adding a new dimension of risk to the impact of the “China factor” on a fragile world.
事实上，在特朗普取胜造成的重大不确定性下，构建新型关系比以往任何时候更具有战略价值，因为全球环境不断变化，而且美中两国都面临着区域地缘政治和国内挑战。	Indeed, amid the vast uncertainty created by Trump’s victory, a new relationship now makes more strategic sense than ever, given changing global circumstances, regional geopolitics, and domestic challenges in both the US and China.
众所周知的、低成本以及低科技含量的防治手段，例如破伤风疫苗、专门母乳、低体重婴儿的简单护理以及防止传染的抗生素等并没有提供给那些最需要得到的孩子。	Well known, low-cost, and low-tech interventions do not reach those most in need – for example immunization against tetanus, exclusive breastfeeding, simple care for low-weight babies, and antibiotics for infection.
尽管如此，即使是迅速实现“更加绿色”的能源转变，也不足以让全球平均气温限定在前工业化水平以上2℃以内。	Still, not even a rapid shift toward “greener” energy will be enough to keep global average temperature within 2º of preindustrial levels.
虽然贾迈勒在埃及掌权已经没有太多障碍，但在阿尔及利亚，将赛义德扶上宝座的努力可能会在强大政权利益的抵制下付诸东流。	While few obstacles remain in Gamal’s path to power in Egypt, in Algeria, meanwhile, a bid to install Said would likely collapse against resistance from powerful regime interests.
可能还有其他办法能够解决问题：那就是像许多市场经济国家那样收紧专利法或对制药等垄断行业实行价格管制。	Other approaches are also possible: tightening up patent laws or imposing price controls for monopolistic industries, such as pharmaceuticals, as many market economies have done.
柏林—据5月初ARD德国趋势（DeutschlandTREND）的民意调查，极右翼的德国另类道路党（Alternative for Germany，AfD）的民众支持率为15 % ， 而一年前只有5 % 。	BERLIN – According to an early May opinion poll by ARD DeutschlandTREND, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party’s popular support now stands at 15%, up from around 5% a year ago.
默克尔有两个选择：她可以右倾，如法国前总统萨科齐为法国总统大选所做的最后一搏那样；她也可以硬碰AfD的简单化立场，坚持中间道路。	Merkel has two choices: She can move to the right, as former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has done in his latest bid for the French presidency, or she can fight to hold the center by addressing the AfD’s simplistic arguments head on.
但另一个有害的传说是“欧洲堡垒”正在遭受一波又一波野蛮人的冲击。 这一传说通过令人震惊的影像传播 — — 大量难民蜂拥通过边境隔离带，或者试图攀上加莱（Calais）的火车 — — 它存在两个层面的错误。	Yet another damaging myth, perpetuated by shocking images of refugees swarming through border fences or attempting to climb onto trains in Calais, is that “Fortress Europe” is under assault by waves of barbarians.
在2016年核安全峰会召开之前，我们最需要的是有一套程序促进全面解决核威胁的全球行动，确保全面禁止核试验条约生效就是其中之一。	What is most needed in the run-up to the 2016 NSS is a process that advances global action to address the nuclear threat comprehensively, including by ensuring that the CTBT enters into force.
那么，IMF给出了“资本流自由化的综合性方针 ” ， 并具体给出了改革的详细步骤，既然如此，关于资本管制和如何使其更有效也不具有什么可比性了。	So, while the Fund lays out an “integrated approach to capital flow liberalization,” and specifies a detailed sequence of reforms, there is nothing remotely comparable on capital controls and how to render them more effective.
NDPO的修改草案似乎认识到这一点，同时强调日本自卫、日美联盟的合作、以及对多边使命做出贡献的必要性。	The draft revision of the NDPO seems to recognize this, emphasizing the need for Japan’s own defense efforts, cooperation through the Japanese-US alliance, and contributions to multilateral missions.
俄罗斯目前向中国销售某些武器，但却避免向其出口最尖端的系统。 因为克里姆林宫将中国看作未来潜在的威胁。	Russia currently sells certain arms to China, but avoids exporting its most sophisticated systems, since the Kremlin views China as a potential future threat.
日益开放的金融市场让外国银行和资产管理者能够迅速甩卖债务 — — 通常是出于与经济基本面无关的理由。	Increasingly open financial markets allow foreign banks and asset managers to dump debts rapidly, often for reasons that have little to do with economic fundamentals.
与此相反，中国的腐败通常都是“利益分享”型，那些国有企业高管的家庭成员都拥有股份，他们的收益随着企业盈利的上升而增加 — — 这是某种促进经济增长的腐败。	By contrast, in China, the corruption has largely been of the “profit-sharing” variety, whereby family members are given a stake in the enterprise so that their earnings increase as profits increase – a type of corruption that promotes growth.
朝鲜领袖金正恩绝非中国邓小平式的改革分子；但因为市场不可逆转的扩张力量，他的政权正日复一日变得与中国越来越相似。	North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is no reformist like China’s Deng Xiaoping; but his regime is becoming more like China’s every day, owing to the irreversible expansion of market forces.
民主党的这项承诺本应是日本新独立自主战略的一部分，只要踏出了第一步，日本就不会再像某位自民党前首相所说的那样，仅仅是美国的一艘“航空母舰 ” 。	This promise by the DPJ was meant to be part of Japan’s new assertiveness, a first step away from being a mere “aircraft carrier” for the US, as a former LDP prime minister once described his country.
美国会愿意向印度出售进攻性武器 — — 包括高精确度常规武器、反潜系统和长程空基和地基巡航导弹 — — 以有助于威慑中国的军事先发制人吗？	Would the US be willing to sell India offensive weapons – including high-precision conventional arms, anti-submarine systems, and long-range air- and sea-launched cruise missiles – that could help to deter Chinese military preemption?
从这一技术官僚观点来看，今天的布鲁塞尔维持了某些功能，而即使在某些民族国家内部，这些功能都经常被分派到不是民主选举产生的机构中。	From this technocratic perspective, Brussels today maintains functions that even within nation states are often delegated to institutions that are not democratically elected.
库尔德人民民主党（Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party，HDP）在最近的大选中大获成功，获得13%选票 — — 远多于该党核心选区的选票比例 — — 这必然会增强库尔德人的信心，有利于和平进程。	The success of the mainly Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) in capturing 13% of the vote in the recent election – a total well above the party’s core constituency – should boost the Kurds’ confidence and ease the way ahead in the peace process.
西方自由民主国家应该如何面对一个按照自己的战略计划行动、利用它们的开放性推动它的意识形态和地缘政治目标的中国？	How should Western liberal democracies confront a China that is taking a page from their own playbook, as it exploits their openness to advance its ideological and geopolitical objectives?
但尽管当局在1999年他们上一次面临严重不良贷款问题用过这招，货币印刷机却无法与官员的另一既定目标相兼容：稳定的汇率。	But, while the authorities relied on this approach in 1999, the last time they were faced with a serious bad-loan problem, running the money printing press is not compatible with officials’ other stated goal: a stable exchange rate.
埃尔多安说他想“让阿夫林回到真正的所有者手中 ” ， 从而让350万土耳其境内叙利亚难民“尽快回到自己的土地上 ” 。	Erdoğan has claimed that he wants “to deliver Afrin to its real owners,” thereby enabling the more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey to return “to their own land as soon as possible.”
如此一来，中、东欧各国的选民们现在觉得政府让他们做了亏本生意也在情理之中：勒紧裤带、劳务市场限制和欧盟规章的狂轰滥炸。	Little wonder, then, that voters in Central and Eastern Europe now feel that they got a poor bargain from the governments that brought them in: belt tightening, labor market restrictions, and the notorious barrage of EU regulation.
鉴于人类有限的阅读速度（每分钟200-300字）和现有的巨大的信息量，当今有效的决策在知识精密化的每一个方面都需要语义技术。	Given humans’ limited reading speed (200-300 words per minute) and the enormous volume of available information, effective decision-making today calls for semantic technology in every aspect of knowledge refinement.
取得险胜的执政者上台后奉行极端主义政策也会造成类似的后果。 有人说乔治·W·布什在美国已经贯彻了这样的做法，很多人害怕奥夫拉多尔（Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador）会领导墨西哥追随布什的后尘。	The same may also be true if narrow winners adopt a radical agenda, as some think George W. Bush has done in America and many feared Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador would do in Mexico.
但他们同时引入了目的完全相反的记忆法：通过将历史暴行的责任完全推给他人 — — 无论是希特勒的德国还是斯大林的苏联 — — 来粉饰国家叙事。	But they have also introduced memory laws with essentially the opposite aim: to whitewash national narratives by shifting the responsibility for historical atrocities entirely onto others, whether Hitler’s Germany or Stalin’s Soviet Union.
相反，目前令人失望的局面正是来自结构改革逻辑：大部分改革的好处要很迟才会到来，而不是在一国真正需要它们时到来。	Instead, the current disappointment arises from the very logic of structural reform: most of the benefits come much later, not when a country really needs them.
2008年11月，载有墨西哥国家安全顾问胡安·卡米罗·马利罗（Juan Camilo Mourino）的飞机神秘坠毁。	In November, 2008, a plane carrying Juan Camilo Mourino, Mexico’s national security advisor, crashed under mysterious circumstances.
但是这一先导性工作现在处于停滞状态，而数以百万计的农民取得有效而对环境无害危机解决途径的希望也停滞了。	But the pioneering work is now on hold, as are the hopes of millions of farmers for an effective, environmentally friendly answer to the crisis.
2008年为数不多的积极结果之一是G-20全球影响力的加强；理论上，G-20是远比G-7代表性更强的国际领导力论坛。	One of the few positive consequences of the 2008 financial crisis was the elevation of the G-20's global role; in principle, it is a far more representative forum for international leadership than the G-7 ever was.
普瑞德-威利综合症则有如下特征，肌张力差，性激素水平低下以及大脑控制饱饿感的部分出现缺陷，从而导致过度进食和肥胖。	Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by poor muscle tone, low levels of sex hormones, and a defect in the part of the brain that controls feelings of satiety or hunger, which leads to overeating and obesity.
尽管ICC的总检察官Luis Moreno-Ocampo表示有信心将巴希尔绳之以法，但究竟如何操作还是个未知数。	While the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, expresses confidence that Bashir will be brought to justice, it is unclear how this will happen.
正如在线支付系统PayPal的联合创始人彼得·蒂耶（Peter Thiel）曾经指出的那样 ： “ 我们本想要能飞的汽车；谁知却最终收到了140个推特字符 。 ”	It certainly didn’t resolve the big problems, such as eradicating poverty or enabling us to reach Mars. As PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel once noted: “We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.”
是的，我们的政府的主要职责是保护我们；但每时每刻都有人死去，并且死因通常不公正；对于我们追求或可以追求多大程度保护的界线也不清晰。	Yes, our government’s primary job is to protect us; but people die all the time, often unfairly, and there are limits on how much protection we seek or even allow.
考虑到几个重要政府对投票抱有顽固的批评立场，以及若干成员国内部抗议和欧洲怀疑主义党派的势力陡增，将要进行的谈判面临着巨大的困难。	These negotiations will be much harder in view of the spectacular repudiation of a number of key governments at the ballot box, together with the potent rise of protest and Euroskeptic parties in several member states.
欧洲国家放弃繁荣的发展方式，依仗追求理论化的观点，并且这些观点脱离了国际视角，这样做对欧洲而言真的是理智的吗？	But they should not be alone. Is it reasonable that Europe’s countries give up a niche of prosperity on ideological grounds that are irrelevant from a global perspective?
如果人民银行现在只是进一步拉平不受其干预约束的卖出价，那么它就是在进一步靠近完全基于市场的汇率机制。	If the PBOC is now simply moving closer to averaging the offer prices that are not subject to its interference, it is moving closer to an entirely market-based exchange-rate regime.
诚然，一些新兴市场企业累积的美元计价外债数量令人担忧，但许多外国央行拥有充足的美元资产，特别是亚洲。	Although it is true that several emerging-market firms have piled up worrisome quantities of dollar-denominated external debt, many foreign central banks are brimming with dollar assets, especially in Asia.
知道目前，美国人通过从轻易受到影响的外国人那里廉价借钱并且把钱投资于高回报的外国资产、土地以及债券而攫取利润。	Until now, Americans have been raking in profits by borrowing cheaply from pliant foreigners and investing the money in high-yield foreign equities, land, and bonds.
蒸汽机或老式汽车的工作原理一目了然，而现代的汽车飞机如此复杂，以至于这些高科技产品的操纵者对其实际工作���理毫无概念。	In contrast to a steam engine or an old-fashioned automobile, whose operations were easily comprehensible, modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their operators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works.
虽然各国的尤其是在欧洲的众多分析家们已经得出结论，认为这类事件在可预见的将来不可能发生，但印度却是个例外。	While many analysts in a wide variety of nations, especially in Europe, have concluded that such an event could not occur there in the foreseeable future, India is an exception.
伊朗可以把公布伊朗人经常引用但是从来没有被人看见的关键文件作为一个良好的开端－例如，据传规定伊斯兰教禁止从事核武器的生产、储存和使用的阿亚图拉·哈梅内伊的裁定？	A good start would be to publish key documents that are constantly referred to by Iranians but never seen – say, Ayatollah Khamenei’s fatwa that reportedly rules that Islam prohibits the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons?
其新成立的全球基础设施便利（Global Infrastructure Facility，GIF）将动员全球退休基金和主权财富基金投资作为具体资产类别的基础设施。	Its new Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) will mobilize global pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in infrastructure as a specific asset class.
发自伦敦 — — 法国作家莫里哀的古典主义喜剧《伪君子》告诉我们，正是放任骄傲 — — 而非诉诸理性 — — 决定了一个人的行为无可避免地以糟糕收场。	LONDON – In his classic comedy “Tartuffe, or The Impostor,” Molière shows that allowing pride, rather than reason, to dictate one’s actions invariably ends badly.
无论如何，把经过基因改造的运动员贬斥为突变异种或非人类在道德上站不住脚，因为它引发了与其它生物特征，尤其是种族、性别和残疾相联系的同样的偏见，而我们对这些偏见理应深恶痛绝。	In any case, to describe genetically modified athletes as mutants or inhuman is morally suspect, for it invokes the same kind of prejudice that we deplore in relation to other biological characteristics, particularly race, gender, and disability.
华盛顿—拉马福萨（Cyril Ramaphosa）在12月的南非执政党非国大党领导人竞争中胜出，这是总统祖玛遭到否定的明确标志。	WASHINGTON, DC – Cyril Ramaphosa’s victory in December’s contest to lead South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) was a resounding repudiation of President Jacob Zuma.
这些和其他许多例子表明，如果政府能提供多样化的、相对具体的、与时俱进的正确的公共品组合，企业可以变得更加高效。	As these and many other examples show, business can become more efficient if governments provide the right combination of a diverse, relatively specific, and evolving set of public goods.
研究人员推测大约5，000年前，人类首次在非洲感染结核病，而后这种疾病迅速沿着贸易路线传播到全球几乎每一个角落。	Researchers theorize that humans first acquired TB in Africa about 5,000 years ago, and that the disease then swiftly spread along trade routes to nearly every corner of the globe.
与此同时这些妥协方案和所有财务报表或者女式泳衣有着同样的特质：那就是它们试图掩盖的部分才是最精彩的地方。	But those compromises are like statistics or skimpy swimsuits: what they show is less important than what they hide.
Spitfire战机飞行员被披头士、滚石、奇想等有力的自由象征所取代，他们的音乐如同一股清风横扫欧洲和美国。	Spitfire pilots were replaced as vigorous symbols of liberty by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Kinks, whose music swept across Europe and the United States like a gust of fresh air.
这些行为之所以有问题，原因在于它阻碍了资金的有效流动。 同样，外国政府也可以用同样的方式来对付非本国的银行。	Such actions are problematic not only because they insulate inefficient forms of production, but also because foreign countries respond by adopting similar measures towards their national champions, so that everyone is worse off.
这部“推土机”已经成为大多数以色列人的祖父，和西方外交的最后一张牌—对于意料之外的美国人和意料之中的欧洲人都是如此。	The “bulldozer” had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy, for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans, too.
《华盛顿邮报》媒体专栏玛格丽特·苏利文（Margaret Sullivan）最近观察道，对美国总统特朗普的报道狭隘地聚焦于他的用词，却忽视了他的政策。	As the Washington Post’s media columnist Margaret Sullivan recently observed, coverage of US President Donald Trump has focused narrowly on his words, at the expense of his policy.
我们的发病大部分是随机的，即使我们的医生无法告诉我们未来几年我们会得什么病，或者无法在我们得病时消除我们的所有痛苦，但我们仍乐于接受他们所能提供的帮助。	Our maladies are largely random, and even if our doctors cannot tell us which ones we will have in the next year, or eliminate all of our suffering when we have them, we are happy for the help that they can provide.
但日本的经济前沿绝不仅限于亚洲合伙太平洋，而是要延伸到拉丁美洲和非洲，因此，我们更应该抛弃长期以来的内向角度。	But Japan’s economic frontiers extend well beyond Asia and the Pacific, to Latin America and Africa – more reason to abandon our long-held inward-looking perspective.
一战后，国际社会实施了所谓的《毒气协议 》 （ Gas Protocol ） ， 禁止使用化学武器和生物武器。	After World War I, the international community adopted the so-called Gas Protocol, to prohibit the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons.
这一观点认为，如果不存在可让渡的生产性资料个人所有权，就无法找到充分的激励追求发展政策，而共同资源 （ “ 共有物 ” ） 将被过度利用和低效使用。	Absent alienable individual ownership of productive resources, it is asserted, there will be insufficient means and incentives to pursue development initiatives, and shared resources (the “commons”) will be over-exploited and used inefficiently.
澳大利亚、新西兰和加拿大分别为27 % 、 28 % 、 和20 % ， 这部分要归因于这些国家积极的移民政策。	In Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, it is 27%, 28%, and 20%, respectively, a consequence in part of these countries’ activist immigration policies.
在这一点上，卡钦斯基正在模仿他的偶像，两次世界大战之间的波兰领袖约瑟夫·毕苏斯基（尽管这位“波兰第一元帅”确实曾经两次担任总理 ） 。	In this, Kaczyński is emulating his idol, the interwar leader Józef Piłsudski (though the “First Marshal of Poland” did go on to serve as prime minister twice).
正如英格兰银行马克·卡尼（Mark Carney，我猜他也听了默多克的演讲）在今年早些时候所言 ， “ （未经）深思熟虑的市场原教旨主义可能毁灭对资本主义本身的长期活力至关重要的社会资本 。 ”	As the Bank of England’s Governor Mark Carney (who I assume also heard Murdoch’s lecture) remarked earlier this year, “[U]nchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself.”
当前经济状况的逻辑意味着政府应该利用超低利率的时机来投资于可以刺激需求和改善经济结构的基础设施项目。	The logic of current economic conditions implies that governments should be taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to invest in infrastructure projects, which would both stimulate demand and improve the structure of the economy.
毕竟，他将向穆勒的检察官们提供与弗拉基米尔·普京总统关系密切的某些俄罗斯寡头的罪证 — — 这些人对敢于背叛他们的人从不特别温和。	After all, he would be giving Mueller’s prosecutors the goods on some Russian oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin – folks who are not particularly gentle toward people who betray them.
感染了牛海绵状脑病却没有明显症状的个体对其它人构成了威胁，有可能通过输血或手术造成变异型克雅氏病的二次传染。	Individuals infected with BSE who remain in an asymptomatic state during their lives could represent a risk to others of potential secondary transmission of variant CJD through blood transfusion or surgery.
这一方法帮助许多世界级超级企业崛起，也给劳动力市场和社会带来了严重问题，因为它摧毁基于旧技能的中层岗位的速度快于基于新技能的同等岗位的创造速度。	As this approach facilitates the rise of global super-firms, it creates serious problems for labor markets and societies, because it destroys mid-level jobs based on old skills faster than comparable jobs based on new skills can be created.
此外，随着发达经济体竞争力日益提高，以及中国在价值链中地位的攀升，更多的投入品需要在各国国内就地解决。	And, as advanced economies become more competitive, and as China moves up the value chain, more inputs are being sourced within countries.
她还援引了印度教与自然世界的深刻联系来说明“河流崇拜，山丘崇拜，树木崇拜”是“印度的文化遗产 ” 。	“River worship, mountain worship, tree worship,” she said, invoking Hinduism’s deep connections to the natural world, “is India’s cultural heritage.”
疲软的增长已经降至2 % （ 在2010年有过短暂的反弹 ） ， 产出出现大规模负缺口，这表明总就业情况的恢复将非常缓慢，在这种情况下，各国仍采取了收紧财政政策。	Fiscal policy was being tightened when growth was languishing below 2% (after bouncing back in 2010), and sizeable negative output gaps suggested that overall employment would be slow to recover.
如果特朗普真的关注国家安全，那么令人奇怪的是，美国为什么不将地下矿石指定为抵抗未来敌对行动的战略储备。	If Trump really is concerned about national security, then one wonders why the US is not keeping ore in the ground as a strategic reserve for future hostilities.
更加多元化的马哈拉施特拉邦的奥兰加巴德（Aurangabad）城市集群是不少印度最大的种子公司的所在地，拥有活跃的汽车、制药和糖生产行业，同时也是旅游枢纽，坐落着阿旃陀（Ajanta）和艾洛拉（Ellora）石窟。	The more diversified Aurangabad cluster, in Maharashtra, is home to some of India’s largest seed companies, an active automotive, pharmaceutical, and sugar-manufacturing industry, and a tourism hub that includes the Ajanta and Ellora caves.
相反，美国容许在以色列政府缺乏任何行动的情况下出现一个政治真空，而如今这个真空就被“阿拉伯觉醒”所填补了。	Instead, the US allowed a political vacuum to form in the absence of any movement on the part of Israel’s government. This vacuum has now been filled by the Arab Awakening.
但鉴于包括共同文化或环境 — — 或随机因素 （ “ 基因漂变 ” ） 在内的多重原因均可造成某种特质随时间推移发生可以衡量的变化，因此证明这种现象的研究非常罕见。	But, given that measurable alterations in a trait over time can occur for many reasons – including those related to shared culture or environment – or randomly (“genetic drift”), studies demonstrating this phenomenon are rare.
不仅他是如此：在每一个伟大的帝国背后，都有一位伟大的哲学家和历史学家，他的世界观推动帝国带着合法性甚至神圣性前进。	And he was not unique: behind every great empire has been a great philosopher or historian whose worldview imbued the imperial drive with legitimacy and even sacred significance.
这将导致英国国会中支持脱欧的英国独立党的兄弟党派五星运动（Five Star Movement）上台掌权。	That could bring to power the Five Star Movement, a partner of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party in the European Parliament.
这些新技术实现了个人赋权 — — 特别是给快速增长的年轻人口 — — 也让经济和社会发展走上了康庄大道。	These new technologies empower people – most notably the rapidly growing youth population – and create new avenues for economic and social development.
成功需要每年投入6,000亿美元，涉及到的领域包括环境修复和保护、可再生能源和能源效率，以及可持续交通系统。	Success will require an estimated $600 billion in investment each year, in areas including environmental remediation and protection, renewable energies and energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation systems.
从1985到1995年雅克·德洛尔任委员会主席以来，再也没有有远见或政治影响力的领袖担任过委员会主席职务。	Not since Jacques Delors was President of the Commission, from 1985 to 1995, has that position been filled by a leader with any vision or political clout.
黎巴嫩潜在的碳氢化合物财富的确可以协助这个国家完成转型，同时为中东其他能源生产国提供一种模式用于参照。	Lebanon’s potential hydrocarbon wealth could indeed transform the country, as well as providing a model for other Middle Eastern energy producers to follow.
如果唯一的结果是降低其外交政策的可靠性和可预见性 — — 甚至更糟，招致别人的误解 — — 那么答案当然是不需要。	If the outcome is to make its foreign policy less reliable and predictable – or, worse, susceptible to misunderstanding – then it certainly does not.
左翼意识形态（特别是在英国）更多地来源于某些基督教道德传统 （ “ 比马克思更加卫理公会 ” ） 而非任何政治教条。	Left-wing ideology, especially in Britain, owed more to certain Christian moral traditions (“more Methodist than Marx”) than to any political dogma.
但仍有八个国家没有签署全面禁止核试验条约，这使该条约无法产生效力，其对全球安全的作用也没有纳入核安全峰会的日程。	Yet the failure of eight countries to ratify the CTBT has prevented it from entering into force, and its contribution to global security has so far not been included on the NSS agenda.
奥斯汀，德克萨斯—四百年前，约翰·罗尔夫（John Rolfe）用从西印度群岛偷来的烟草种子发展出弗吉尼亚州第一宗盈利的出口生意，扰乱了西班牙加勒比海殖民地的烟草贸易。	AUSTIN, TEXAS – Four hundred years ago, John Rolfe used tobacco seeds pilfered from the West Indies to develop Virginia’s first profitable export, undermining the tobacco trade of Spain’s Caribbean colonies.
同样，阵亡抚恤金仅仅是50万美元，大大低于死亡的一生全部经济成本的标准估计。 有时也把它称作生命的统计学价值（在610万美元到650万美元之间 ） 。	Similarly, payments for those who are killed amount to only $500,000, which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death, sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ($6.1 to $6.5 million).
美国和其他很多发达国家的模式则恰好相反，随着其国内生产及出口资本密集度的提升，他们的经常账户余额均出现了恶化。	This pattern contrasts with that of the United States and many other advanced countries, which have experienced a deterioration of their current-account balances as their production and exports have become more capital-intensive.
但美国回归亚洲中心舞台的风光面临着中国战略雄心的制约，其充当亚洲主要安全锚所要面对着诸多关键性的挑战。	But the heady glow of America’s return to center stage in Asia has obscured key challenges in remaining the region’s principal security anchor in the face of China’s strategic ambitions.
真相是传统西方列强尽管有诸多共同点，但在许多方面仍然是多样化的，从能源政策 — — 欧洲碳氢化合物依赖远大于美国 — — 到安全莫不如此。	The truth is that the traditional Western powers, despite having plenty in common, diverge in many areas, from energy policy – Europe is far more dependent on hydrocarbons than the US – to security.
在邻国也门陷入一场代理战争僵局的沙特人高兴地看到特朗普正在考虑增加援助来驱逐伊朗侵占其战略后院的行动。	The Saudis, bogged down in a proxy war with Iran in neighboring Yemen, are elated that Trump is contemplating an increase in assistance to repel Iranian encroachment from their strategic backyard.
意大利和西班牙等传统天主教欧洲国家有自由堕胎法，但拉丁美洲仍保留着最虔诚的信仰，保持着这个世界最严格的法律禁忌。	While traditionally Roman Catholic European countries like Italy and Spain have liberalized their abortion laws, Latin America has remained true to the faith, maintaining some of the world’s strictest legal prohibitions.
伦敦 — — 马琳·勒庞，法国极右翼国家阵线领袖声称爱国主义和全球主义之战将成为21世纪一场决定性的战争。	LONDON – Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Front, claims that the twenty-first century’s defining battle will be between patriotism and globalism.
而欧盟则提供这一套共同规则，通过共同的机构，让每一个国家 — — 即使是最小的 — — 都能有发言权。	The EU provides this set of common rules, buttressed by common institutions that give every country, even the smallest, a say.
但那些刚刚遭遇房价泡沫爆破的国家则不太会产生另一场房价泡沫,因为趋向保守的政府政策可能会减少对住房的补贴，而这些国家当前的市场气氛似乎也无法催生泡沫。	But another housing bubble is not imminent in countries where one just burst.
