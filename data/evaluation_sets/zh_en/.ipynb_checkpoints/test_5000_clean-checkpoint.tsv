印度储备银行行长拉古兰·拉詹（Raghuram Rajan）最近呼吁发达经济体央行通过国际合作顾及新兴市场国家的利益。	Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has recently called for the advanced economies’ central banks to take emerging-market countries’ interests into account via international cooperation.
当然，这并没有使共产党不那么讨厌自由的媒体和欣欣向荣的文明社会，正是它们可以提供重要的信息反馈以确保任何国家的福址。	It has not helped, of course, that the Communist Party loathes a free press and a robust civil society, both of which are essential information feedback loops in ensuring any country’s well-being.
人和人格，以及他们彼此的感觉，能够让小规模的债务看起来如同无法维持，也能够让大规模债务在握手间烟消云散。	People and their personalities, and the way they perceive one another, can make small debts seem unserviceable or large debts disappear with a handshake.
当弗拉基米尔•普京作为俄罗斯的新科总统在2000年到达巴黎时，他所带去的是一个简单而令人欣慰的信息。	When he first arrived in Paris in 2000 as the newly elected President of Russia, Vladimir Putin had a simple and reassuring message to convey.
美国成功的另一个原因是它像磁石一样吸引着来自世界各地最优秀的人才，他们为美国版的全球熔炉贡献着自身的才智和力量。	Another reason for America’s success is that it has been a magnet for the best and brightest from around the world, who have contributed their own talents and energy to the melting pot of America’s narrative.
布鲁塞尔 - - 美国引人入胜的总统大选或许吸引了所有的头条新闻，但是欧洲也在进行一场领导权的斗争。	BRUSSELS – America’s riveting presidential election campaign may be garnering all the headlines, but a leadership struggle is also underway in Europe.
答案就在以下事实。 由美国及其他八个太平洋经济体政府（澳大利亚、文莱、智利、马来西亚、新西兰、秘鲁、新加坡和越南）提出的跨太平洋合作伙伴关系协定（TTP）的目标并不仅是贸易。	The answer lies in the fact that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), launched by Obama and the governments of eight other Pacific economies – Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam – is not just about trade.
）专家认同可以控制疾病的传播速度，但不同意能“彻底遏制 ” 。 承诺或暗示能把传染病挡在国门之外或一旦传入将被立即消灭的官员今后将面对公众的怒火。	Experts agree that pandemics can be slowed, but not “contained.” Officials who promise – or imply – that they can keep this pandemic from their borders, or stop it once it has arrived, are setting themselves up for public outrage later.
但大部分过度储蓄、支出不足的国家并没有减少储蓄、增加支出；它们的经常项目盈余一直在增加，加剧了全球需求的疲软，因而拖累增长。	But most countries that were over-saving and under-spending have not saved less and spent more; their current-account surpluses have been growing, aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth.
20世纪30年代，当开放社会的敌人们威胁到欧洲时，至少有一个强大的对抗模式存在于英国以及（特别是）美国，受到罗斯福新政的有力支持。	When the enemies of the open society were threatening Europe during the 1930s, there was at least a powerful counter model in Britain, and especially the US, bolstered by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.
如果它们无法快速行动起来重塑自己作为可信、高效的选民利益代表的形象，它们就有可能沦为政治背景，让不负责任的民粹主义逐渐占据中心舞台。	If they do not act fast to re-establish themselves as credible and effective representatives of voters’ interests, they risk fading into the political background, allowing irresponsible populists gradually to take center stage.
传递私人讯息的公告牌能够如此容易的占领公共空间是因为俄罗斯的公共空间几乎是闲置的：国家和社会之间的交流即便是有也少得可怜，而公共辩论则几乎没有。	The billboards with their private messages were able to occupy public space so easily because in Russia public space is virtually empty: there's very little, if any, communication between state and society, and barely any public debate.
在当前环境中，地缘政治紧张升级、信任缺失以及对关键性机构的不尊重所形成的累积效应可能带来一次重大冲击，也有可能只是令投资条件出现恶化。	In the current context, the cumulative effect of rising geopolitical tensions, loss of trust, and disrespect for key institutions could produce either a large shock or just deteriorating conditions for investment.
公司的思维（通常暗地里如此）是，通过污染环境实现TSR最大化是可以接受的，只要给CSR项目做一些贡献作为补偿 — — 就好像在恒河里洗一洗就能带走一个人的罪恶一样。	The thinking, mostly implicit, is that maximizing TSR by polluting the environment is acceptable as long as some compensating contributions are made to CSR initiatives – the corporate equivalent of bathing in the Ganges to wash away one’s sins.
海外印度人也依然心系故土，境外汇款总额不断增长，在2008~2009年间达到了464亿美元，其中大部分是来自那些在海湾地区打工的印度蓝领工人。	Indians abroad stayed loyal to India: remittances from overseas Indians remained robust, reaching $46.4 billion in 2008-2009, the bulk of which came from the mainly blue-collar Indian expatriate community in the Gulf countries.
但是这些技术还没有成形，而且我们不能单纯地等待市场来实现这些技术，因为它们要求公共政策上复杂的改变来确保它们安全可靠以及可以为大众所接受。	Yet the technologies are not yet ready, and we can’t simply wait for the market to deliver them, because they require complex changes in public policy to ensure that they are safe, reliable, and acceptable to the broad public.
穆尔西所采纳的列宁主义的“民主集中制”如果持续下去，将是对旧国家组织中的新一代人及其盟友的崛起的挑衅，这甚至会导致内战的代价。	The Leninist “democratic centralism” to which Morsi seemed to have subscribed, if maintained, will be a standing provocation to the new generations and their allies in the old state apparatus to rise up, even at the price of civil war.
它让我想起了1989年秋天布拉格温塞拉斯广场上回荡的键音 ― ― 后来这种声音响彻当时捷克斯洛伐克的其它地方。	It reminds me of the jingle of keys that rang out on Prague’s Wenceslas Square -- and later around the rest of what was then Czechoslovakia -- in the autumn of 1989.
但中国领导人必须认识到，中国面连着大规模福利损失，因此需要拿出接受短期增长放缓以换取更稳定的长期增长路径的意愿。	But China’s leaders must recognize that the country faces massive welfare losses, and thus should be willing to accept slower growth in the short term in exchange for a more stable long-term growth path.
虽然该组织只不过是将白俄罗斯、亚美尼亚、哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、乌兹别克斯坦以及俄罗斯间的双边军事协议强行堆砌在一起，而对此克林姆林宫当局依然感觉良好，安之若素。	For all this, the Kremlin is not in the least embarrassed by the fact that the CSTO is essentially a mechanical connection of bilateral military agreements between Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia.
随着国民政治冷淡程度达到了1930年代那段最黑暗时期以来的高点，欧洲屈服于破坏性民粹主义力量的风险也日渐增大。	With political disenchantment reaching levels not seen since the continent’s darkest times in the 1930s, the risk that Europe will succumb to the destructive forces of populism looms ever larger.
在1945年后的最初三十年间，起主导作用的是布雷顿森林共识 — — 一个允许决策者在关注国内的社会和就业需要的同时，能够使全球 贸易恢复和繁荣的肤浅的多边主义。	The first three decades after 1945 were governed by the Bretton Woods consensus – a shallow multilateralism that permitted policymakers to focus on domestic social and employment needs while enabling global trade to recover and flourish.
该条约由罗纳德·里根和苏共总书记米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫于1987年签署，要求双方销毁地面发射的弹道导弹和巡航导弹，而美国的撤出则标志着新一轮军备竞赛的开始。	Signed in 1987 by Ronald Reagan and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, the INF required both the US and Russia to eliminate ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles. The US withdrawal from it signals the start of a new arms race.
这些结果的任何一个都有悖于中国的战略利益；但和许多政府一样，中国领导人将避免短期的艰难决定，即使这会导致长期的不利结果。	Any of these outcomes would be inconsistent with Chinese strategic interests; but, like many governments, China’s leaders will seek to avoid difficult decisions in the short run, even if this results in damaging outcomes over time.
叙利亚人权观察组织（Syrian Observatory for Human Rights）估算，在过去四年中，近250,000人被杀，包括100,000多名平民，其中有许多是被本国政府以骇人听闻的方式杀害的。	The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that, over the last four years, nearly 250,000 people have been killed, including more than 100,000 civilians, many of whom were killed in horrific ways by their own government.
尽管签署了明斯克 II停火协议，乌克兰依然被俄国支持的分离主义分子所部分占领， 间歇性的战斗仍在进行中。	Ukraine remains under partial occupation by Russian-backed separatists, with intermittent fighting still taking place, despite the Minsk II ceasefire agreement.
除了升级制造业之外，发展中国家应准备好实现向服务业的转型，因为随着收入的增加这是不可避免的 （尽管准确时间很难预测 ） 。	Beyond upgrading manufacturing, developing countries should be preparing for the shift toward services that they will inevitably undergo as incomes rise (though the precise timing is hard to predict).
随着金砖国家在全球经济中的作用越来越大，大型拉美国家与金砖国家保持一致，寻求更大的国际影响力倒也无可厚非。	Given their growing role in the global economy, it is understandable that larger Latin American countries, along with the other BRICS, are seeking a more influential world role.
但特朗普本人的不靠谱承诺 — — 包括在英国和墨西哥之间建设一道墙以及让制造业岗位从海外回到美国 — — 仍令许多选民深信不疑。	Yet Trump’s own implausible promises – including his pledges to construct a wall between the US and Mexico and bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas – still seem credible to many voters.
部分归因于政府的刺激政策，自2008年以来中国增长更多地是由投资而不是消费推动的，这阻碍了世界急需的需求再平衡的进展。	Partly owing to government stimulus measures, China’s growth since 2008 has been driven more by investment than by consumption, which has impeded the economy’s much-needed demand rebalancing.
比如，看起来十分温和的抵制、撤资和制裁运动（Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions，BDS ） — —其许多支持者视其为合法的非暴力抵制 — — 一直在不断赢得进展。	For example, the seemingly benign Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, viewed by many of its supporters as a legitimate form of non-violent resistance, has continued to gain ground.
森林还是一座巨大的“碳沉淀池 ” ， 数百年来存储了巨量大气二氧化碳；因此，保护森林有助于遏制气候变化。	"Forests also serve as an enormous “carbon sink,"" storing atmospheric carbon dioxide for many decades or centuries; thus, protecting forests would help to mitigate climate change."
美国的经济危机所引发的严重的信贷紧缩加剧了美国经济的衰退，而越来越深重的衰退正在引发金融市场更大规模的损失，从而损害更广层面的经济。	America’s financial crisis has triggered a severe credit crunch that is making the US recession worse, while the deepening recession is leading to larger losses in financial markets – thus undermining the wider economy.
希腊经济正在崩溃，人道主义危机日益严重，若无法达成协议，其政府将别无选择，只能印钱提供基本社会服务。	Given Greece’s collapsing economy and growing humanitarian crisis, the government will have no choice, absent an agreement, but to print money to fund basic social services.
更加糟糕的是，选举中的落败者洛佩兹，似乎更愿意让整个国家陷入混乱之中，而不愿意接受按照宪法他已经失败的事实。	Worst of all, the election loser, López Obrador, seems willing to throw the country into turmoil rather than accept the constitutional legitimacy of his defeat.
比如，据说位于佛罗里达州的范祖尔（Fanjul）兄弟阿方索（Alfonso）和何塞（José）就向1月份特朗普的就职典礼捐赠了五十万美元。	For example, the Florida-based Fanjul brothers, Alfonso and José, reportedly contributed a half-million dollars to Trump’s January inauguration.
财政纪律不应该优先于包含在新协议内的重要结构改革，特别是改进退休金、法律制度、产品市场、公共行政和司法的措施。	Fiscal discipline should not take priority over the important structural reforms included in the new deal, particularly measures to overhaul pensions, the legal system, product markets, public administration, and the judiciary.
由于政府苦于预算不足和债务上升，高科技行业正在接受日益严格的监督，在这样的背景下的这样一则消息让我有些怀疑这个决定。	Coming at a time when the technology industry is under increasing scrutiny in the developed world as governments struggle with budget shortfalls and rising debt, this seems to me to be a questionable decision.
自首相安倍晋三于2012年12月重新执政并实施他的货��和财政刺激以及结构性改革计划以来，对日本人信心的影响可谓深远。	Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe assumed office in December 2012 and launched his program of monetary and fiscal stimulus and structural reform, the impact on Japanese confidence has been profound.
但和中国不同的是，印度的下降势头更为显著 — — 2011年第三季度GDP增速低于7%的临界点，而10月年度工业总产值实际下降了5.1 % 。	But unlike China, the downshift is more pronounced – GDP growth fell through the 7% threshold in the third calendar-year quarter of 2011, and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1% in October.
大体上看，马萨诸塞州或者俄亥俄州每出现1美元的GDP下降，所引发的税率变更和转移支付就将冲抵其中40美分，也因此起到有效的财政刺激作用。	Roughly speaking, each dollar of GDP decline in a state like Massachusetts or Ohio triggers changes in taxes and transfers that offset about 40 cents of that drop, providing a substantial fiscal stimulus.
同时，已经存在的安全事务机构 — — 欧安组织（OSCE ） 、 北约-俄罗斯理事会（NATO-Russia Council）以及欧洲-大西洋合作伙伴理事会（Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council）等等 — — 应该得到强化，而为此设置新机构则没有必要。	Security initiatives should therefore first be discussed bilaterally within the NATO-EU framework; only then should a common position be presented at the OSCE. Speaking to Russia with one voice is absolutely essential.
这一决定是为了让彼得森集团能够偿付对银行和普雷索尔债务。 在股票收购中，彼得森集团并没有付钱，而是赊账向普雷索尔进行了收购。	That decision was intended to allow the Petersen Group to service the debts to banks, and to Repsol itself, that it incurred with its share purchase, for which it made no initial payment.
人们曾经希望产品和金融市场的彻底融合会暴露哪些低效行业，把资金流从发展迟缓的国家转移到更加高效的使用者。	It was expected that full integration of product and financial markets would expose inefficiencies, steering investment flows away from laggards towards the more efficient countries.
然而，对猛虎解放组织的胜利，不一定要排除某种保证泰米尔人有一些政治发言权的地方分权形式，只要这种地方自治的程度不至于破坏斯里兰卡的国家统一。	Nevertheless, victory over the Tigers need not rule out some form of decentralization that guarantees the Tamils some political say, so long as a degree of local autonomy does not destroy Sri Lanka’s unity.
相反，战争在国家和非国家行动方之间展开，比如尼日利亚和博科圣地组织（Boko Haram）之间，或印度和纳萨尔（Naxalite）叛军之间。	Instead, wars are between states and non-state actors – between, say, Nigeria and Boko Haram, or between India and its Naxalite insurgents.
对于她那些挥舞着口红的拥趸们来说，佩林是一个朴实、虔诚的“冰球母亲 ” ， 她喜欢捕猎美洲驼鹿、信仰福音教义以及甚至有些混乱的家庭生活，都显示她是一个真实的并且典型的美国人。	To her legions of lipstick-waving fans on the right, Palin is a down-to-earth, God-fearing “hockey mom” whose moose hunting, evangelical faith, and even chaotic family life are all evidence that she is a real, typical American.
更近的例子则有1994年导致80万人死亡的卢旺达大屠杀，以及1995年斯雷布雷尼察地区数千名波斯尼亚男性遭屠杀的事件，当时许多人都发誓不会再让这类惨剧重演。	More recently, after a genocide that cost nearly 800,000 lives in Rwanda in 1994, and the slaughter of Bosnian men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995, many people vowed that such atrocities should never again be allowed to occur.
我们希望《2005国防评估》会着手解决这一问题，虽然它肯定会回答一些战略问题而将其他的留在日后商榷。	One hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue, although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate.
在世界范围内，可再生能源业的就业增长正在蓬勃发展，而（主要因为燃煤电厂关闭 ） ， 传统发电业的就业状况却正在萎缩。	Worldwide, job growth in the renewables industry is booming, while employment in traditional power generation is shrinking (primarily owing to the closure of coal plants).
《华尔街日报》当然也为特朗普的举动欢呼，但同样欢呼的还有《华盛顿邮报》的大卫·伊格纳修斯，后者声称“领导的道德因素”现在终于进入了特朗普的白宫。	The Wall Street Journal hailed Trump’s move, of course, but so did the Washington Post’s David Ignatius, who claimed that “the moral dimensions of leadership” had now found its way into the Trump White House.
比如，寻求吸引投资的政府，可能会将经济利益置于与居民需求同等的地位，从而降低企业环境标准或税收负担。	For example, a government seeking to attract investment might equate economic interests with residents’ needs, and thus lower environmental standards or tax burdens for businesses.
与此同时，特朗普政府采取了极端的、不合道德的反移民政策，比如最近收回的在南部的美墨边境上将移民儿童和他们的家庭分开的政策。	Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pursued extreme and morally unconscionable anti-immigration policies, such as the recently reversed policy of separating migrant children from their families at the southern border with Mexico.
希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯不久前也采纳了类似的论调，宣称“所有进步、民主和亲欧洲的力量都有义务携手并肩站在同一条历史战线上 。 ”	Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras recently adopted similar rhetoric, declaring that “all progressive, democratic, and pro-European forces have a duty to stand side by side on the same side of history.”
这正是好奇心之所以成为一种激情的原因：它不受道德约束，遵从自己的规则。 这也就是为什么社会坚持要以不同的方式来驯服它。	That is precisely what makes it a passion: it is amoral and follows its own laws, which is why society insists on taming it in various ways.
特别值得一提的是，这本书 — — 再加上一篇由高级政府官员匿名撰写的纽约时报评论文章 — — 展示了助手们为阻止一位冷漠、无知和偏执的总统因一时冲动而作出某些灾难性举动可以无所不为到何种程度。	In particular, the book – together with an anonymous New York Times op-ed by a senior administration official – showed how far aides would go to keep an incurious, ignorant, and paranoid president from impulsively doing something disastrous.
从伊斯兰高等教育到伊斯兰银行和宗教官僚机关，马哈蒂尔和安瓦尔偷走了PAS的宗教威望 — — 直到巫统开始分裂。	From Islamic higher education to Islamic banking to religious bureaucracy, Mahathir and Anwar stole the PAS’s religious thunder – that is, until the UMNO split.
地方政府往往更加关注基础设施、教育和住房等涉及地方层面的部分关切 — — 而这些领域并没有受到全球化的大规模影响。	It helps that subnational governments tend to be focused on more local-level concerns – such as infrastructure, education, and housing – that are not perceived as being strongly influenced by globalization.
有些人天真地相信牛吃的是草，现在才发现饲喂肉牛的食品种类繁多，从谷物到鱼肉、养鸡场的垃圾稻草（包括鸡的排泻物）以及屠宰场的下脚料。	People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal, chicken litter (complete with chicken droppings), and slaughterhouse waste.
欧洲远景的失落所造成的影响在2008年秋次贷危机和雷曼倒闭的过程中展露无遗，德国总理默克尔一开始的反应极为民族主义，而且是彻底反欧洲的。	The impact of this lost European perspective became clear in the autumn of 2008 when, in the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-European.
《人民日报》下属的极端民族主义报纸《环球时报》似乎认为，最近在西方发生的恐怖袭击是民主启示录的先兆。	The Global Times, an ultra-nationalist tabloid affiliated with the People’s Daily, seemed to suggest that recent terrorist attacks in the West were a harbinger of some kind of democratic apocalypse.
最后，尽管今天谈论金本位可能给金融市场带来的规范作用，可是金本位国家却经常暂停兑换，这意味着本国货币不能自由兑换成黄金。	Finally, for all the talk today of the discipline that the gold standard supposedly provided, countries that adhered to it regularly suspended convertibility – meaning that the domestic currency could no longer be converted freely into gold.
尽管这些谬误并未让我们质疑全球变暖确实正在发生，确实是人为所致，而且确实将带来很多麻烦，但这些对 IPCC 的质疑也造成了极大的损害。	Although none of these lapses provides any reason to doubt that global warming is real, is man-made, and will create problems for us, these challenges to the IPCC are taking their toll.
如果是后者，那么必须要问一问，这三个经济体中的一个乃至全部是否会与流行的预期相反，将在这个十年余下的时间里给我们一个惊喜？	If it is the latter, one must ask whether, contrary to prevailing expectations, new developments or shifts in any or all three of these economies might surprise us on the upside for the rest of the decade.
对朝鲜战争没有个人记忆或兴趣不大的新几代韩国人显然对美国在南韩对北韩的“阳光政策”中作梗的行为感到憎恶。	New generations of South Koreans, who have no personal recollections of – and perhaps only casual interest in – the Korean War, apparently resent what they regard as America’s undermining South Korea’s “sunshine policy” toward North Korea.
比如，欧元区需要真正的银行联盟（不仅要有共同监督，也要有共同存款保险和共同清算机制）和欧元债券（或类似的债务共同化机制 ） 。	For example, the monetary union needs a real banking union – including not just common supervision, but also common deposit insurance and a common resolution mechanism – and Eurobonds, or some similar vehicle for mutualizing debt.
监管机构学到的智慧是一旦出了什么问题最好赶紧表示“我们早跟你说过了 ” ， 并且偶尔发出些负面警告几乎也没什么坏处。	The received wisdom among regulators is that they are better off being able to say, “We told you so” if something goes wrong, and that there is little downside in occasionally issuing dark warnings.
我最喜欢举的例子是电子病历（我的妻子是医生 ） ， 其中存在着巨大���潜力去以提高美国医疗保健服务的效率。	My favorite example is electronic medical records (my wife is a doctor), which have tremendous potential to enhance the efficiency of health-care delivery in the US.
要点在于跨出你的舒适区，让你自己与周边和你差不多的声音保持距离，并且记住董事要为他们的决定的直接和间接后果负责。	The point is to step outside of one’s comfort zones, distance oneself from the voices around the table that sound just like one’s own, and remember that board members are responsible for the direct and indirect impact of their decisions.
但一些观察者已经看到一些迹象表明这次冲击将带来更大的后果，发达经济体将陷入令人沮丧的反常长期低增长轨道。	But some observers already saw signs that this shock would prove more consequential, with the advanced economies finding themselves locked into a frustrating and unusual long-term low-growth trajectory.
上述发现让科研人员可以选择取得疗效机率更大的患者进入到研究小组，同时避免让可能疗效不佳的患者出现副作用。	Such discoveries have enhanced researchers’ ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug, while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit.
联合国的各成员国现在如何应对—特别是那些相信联合国的使命和价值的国家—可以在解决其它更为广泛的现时地区冲突中助一臂之力，特别是在都支持真主党的伊朗和叙利亚的事务方面。	How member states respond now – especially those who believe in the purpose and value of the UN - may help shape the outcomes of other, wider ongoing regional conflicts, notably with Iran and Syria, both of which support Hezbollah.
我们决不因为保护主义和民族主义政治而降经济分比起来，而必须构建公民与领导人之间的新的社会契约，让所有人在国内获得足够的安全感，保持经济基本对世界开放。	Rather than closing off economies through protectionism and nationalist politics, we must forge a new social compact between citizens and their leaders, so that everyone feels secure enough at home to remain open to the world at large.
事实上，缺乏有勇气的领导人已经使国际社会针对当前埃博拉疫情的有效反应来得太迟，从而大大增加了这次危机所付出的代价。	Indeed, the dearth of bold leadership has already delayed an effective international response to the current Ebola outbreak for far too long, drastically increasing the costs of the crisis.
他启动了对养老金和高等教育方面一直久拖不决的重大改革，在介入科特迪瓦和利比亚事务也做出了正确的选择。	He has also launched a major and long-overdue reform of the pension system and higher education. He made the right choices in intervening in Côte d’Ivoire and Libya.
法德两国政府最近决定推动共同开发新型战斗机的计划当然算是迈出了良好的第一步，但不要因此寄望能在不久的将来看到任何明显的合作成果。	The French and German governments recently decided to move ahead on a plan jointly to develop a new fighter jet, which is certainly a good first step. But one should not expect to see any spectacular cooperative achievements in the immediate future.
计划可能会在 《福克斯新闻》甚至《纽约时报》专家中引来不错的反响，这些所谓的专家会摸着自己的下巴惋惜民主党人否决特朗普慷慨的基础设施计划。	The plan will be well-received at Fox News, and possibly even by pundits at The New York Times, who might stroke their chins and lament that the Democrats are rejecting Trump’s open hand on infrastructure.
而每年流向当今发展中国家的数额近2.5万亿，即第三世界国家人均每年会得到500美金。 对于那些现在的日收入不足2美金的人而言，这几乎是他们年收入的一半了。	And about $2.5 trillion annually would go to today’s developing countries every year, or $500 a year on average for each individual in the third world, almost half of whom now survive on less than $2 a day.
这一结果对那些熟悉日本银行危机的人来说无比熟悉：僵尸银行贷款给僵尸公司，反而把压力施加到了有活力的企业身上，扼杀了它们的成长。	The result will look familiar to aficionados of Japan’s banking crisis: zombie banks lending to zombie firms, which apply artificial pressure on viable firms, stifling their growth.
而这在一定程度上还是要归功于这位老独裁者。 由于在其死前恢复了国王胡安▪卡洛斯领导下的君主政治，弗朗哥给西班牙提供了一个重建的基础。	Here the old dictator can take some credit, for by re-establishing the monarchy under King Juan Carlos just before he died, Franco provided Spain with a foundation on which to build anew.
总而言之，新兴经济体遭遇的是由外部产生的宏观经济转变，非常规货币政策，大范围的市场波动以及发达市场缓慢增长所带来的挑战。	In short, emerging economies have been challenged by externally generated macroeconomic shifts, unconventional monetary policies, widespread volatility, and slow growth in developed markets.
但叙利亚依然可以实现和平改革，只要国际社会承认一味强调叙利亚的“复杂国情”对其民众不利，就能够影响到和平改革进程的走势。	Peaceful change in Syria can nonetheless be achieved, and the international community can influence that process by recognizing that its continued focus on the country's “complexity” does nothing for its people.
比如，它容忍世界增长最快的核武国家巴基斯坦，尽管用特朗普的话说，巴基斯坦“满嘴荒唐言 ” ， 包括为“我们在阿富汗追捕的恐怖分子提供安全港 。 ”	For example, it tolerates the world’s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal in Pakistan, even though that country, in Trump’s words, has “given us nothing but lies and deceit,” including providing a “safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.”
但国际货币基金组织（IMF）等金融机构现在正在反驳这一“自有资金”的概念，指出政府的风险越高，项目就越不能被定义为的“表外 ” 。	But financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund are now pushing back against this notion of “free money,” by pointing out that the higher the risk for a government, the less a project can be defined as “off-book.”
他们发现在这一时期，当国内企业所得税率高于其他经合组织国家时，企业利润增长的平均值就会超过了 GDP 增长。	They find that, during that period, average corporate-profit growth outpaced GDP growth whenever the domestic corporate-income-tax rate exceeded that of other OECD countries.
IMF是全球金融稳定的法定监护人，预警和预防失败的问题远比其对英国紧缩的看法严重得多，前者会导致极大的代价，并且这些代价往往会影响到无数人，特别是最脆弱群体。	Given that the IMF is the world’s anointed guardian of financial stability, its failure to warn and preempt constitutes a far more grievous lapse than its position on British austerity, with huge costs borne by many, especially the most vulnerable.
而且，即使在胚胎发育时期引起它们之间差异的刺激物早就不存在了，这些细胞的特征也在各自的细胞谱系中分别得到了遗传。	Moreover, the cells’ features are inherited in their respective cell lineages, even though the stimuli that triggered the differences between them during embryonic development are long gone.
上个月，一条从埃及向以色列和约旦输送天然气的管道发生爆炸 — — 这是穆巴拉克政权倒台以来的第15起类似事件 — — 至今没有修复使用。	Last month, a pipeline carrying Egyptian natural gas to Israel and Jordan was bombed – the 15th such attack since Mubarak’s regime was toppled – and remains out of commission.
2016年7月，东盟外交部长会议在联合公报中也没有提到两周前国际仲裁庭所做出的不利于中国的标志性裁决。	In July 2016, ASEAN foreign ministers failed to mention in their joint communiqué the landmark ruling against China that had been issued just two weeks before by an international arbitral tribunal on the disputes.
因此，G20对IMF指导方案的支持对于一个正在试图从金融危机中复苏、同时又在预防危机重演的世界来说并不明智。	So, the G-20’s endorsement of the Fund’s guidelines would not be wise for a world economy trying to recover from one financial crisis while preventing the next one.
采用这一方法，发展中国家可以实现动态增长，形成就业创造和贫困减少的良性循环，即使其总体基础设施和营商环境仍然有所欠缺。	With this approach, a developing country can grow dynamically, and create a virtuous circle of job creation and poverty reduction, even if its overall infrastructure and business environment are still lacking.
比如，国有企业或许可以将它们建立的私募股权资金挂牌，同时将它们投资的国内高科技企业粉饰为潜在挂牌对象。	For example, SOEs may be able to list private-equity funds that they establish, while grooming domestic high-tech firms in which they invest for potential listings of their own.
但现实是，帮助境况类似于巴西的国家正是IMF这样的全球金融机构能够起到建设性作用的领域。 应该指出，今天的IMF比十年前更加灵活和开放。	But the reality is that helping countries in situations like Brazil’s is an area where global financial institutions like the IMF – which, it should be noted, is more flexible and open today than it was a decade ago – can play a constructive role.
为了重塑美国的道德领导力，总统奥巴马必须兑现他曾经说过的话，真正给受压迫的人民带去曙光 — — 如他在就任总统早期在伊斯坦布尔和开罗说的那样。	In order to restore America’s moral leadership, President Barack Obama must make good on his early rhetoric – exemplified in his speeches in Istanbul and Cairo early in his presidency – which demonstrated genuine regard for the oppressed.
显然，多米诺效应并不会止于此处：银行A和银行B的破产可能会把银行C — — 甚至更多的银行 — — 拖入险境。	Obviously, the domino effect need not stop there: the insolvency of banks A and B could get a bank C – and additional banks – into trouble.
如果消费开支一路上涨，我们则希望各国央行提高利率，降低基建开支的热度，从而释放防止通货膨胀和短缺所需的资源。	If consumers go on a spending binge, we expect the world's central banks to raise interest rates to cool off construction spending and free up the resources needed to prevent shortage-inducing inflation.
以色列政府或许是抓住这次残酷谋杀作为借口挑衅哈马斯，促使后者做出可以让以色列反对来入侵和摧毁连通加沙和以色列的地道。	The Israeli government may have seized on the outrageous murders as a pretext for provoking Hamas into a response that would allow Israel, in turn, to invade and destroy the tunnels Hamas has dug from Gaza into Israel.
而特朗普的竞选搭档、印第安纳州州长麦克·彭斯（Mike Pence）2000至2012年间在众议院供职，与众议院议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）和其他共和党领导人关系甚密。	And Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, Governor of Indiana, served in the House from 2000 to 2012 and has close ties to Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders.
同样，美国2003年在伊拉克发动的为期三周的“震慑行动”战役以“胜利”告终，但却为占领者和普通的伊拉克人打开了地狱之门。	Likewise, America’s three-week “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “victory,” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
在加上奥地利、荷兰和未加入欧元区的北欧国家 — — 瑞士、瑞典、丹麦和挪威，北欧国家去年经常项目盈余总量为5110亿美元。	Together with the surpluses of Austria, the Netherlands, and most non-eurozone northern countries – namely, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway – northern Europe has run a current-account surplus of $511 billion over the last 12 months.
虽然富裕女性可以也确实付钱给贫困女性承担照顾工作，但也有很多人选择兼职或弹性工作以便履行子女的鼓励和教育职责。	Although wealthy women can and do buy the care work of poorer women, many also choose to work part-time or flexibly to provide the stimulation and education their children need.
但只要关注重点恰当，他们可以用少得多的资源大幅提高粮仓质量，避免超过30%的粮食 — — 往往靠近那些贫困的农村人口 — — 变质到不适合人类食用。	But, with the right focus and much more modest resources, they could dramatically improve the quality of grain silos where more than 30% of food – typically located close to the rural poor – spoils to the point of being unfit for human consumption.
美国总统奥巴马在去年 11 月的首次访华，以及他所表现出的那种卑微而有求于人的形象，更加强了这种当今和未来两大强权之间可能达成协议的印象。	President Barack Obama’s first visit to China last November, in which he accepted the role of pliant suitor at the court of the emperor, strengthened the impression of a deal between today’s great power and tomorrow’s.
尽管我们历尽艰辛为妇女赢得了不少权益，但对于这个她们 — — 以及她们的孩子的健康和发育的关键问题，我们仍然比计划落后了一百年。	Despite hard-won gains for women, we remain a century behind schedule on an issue that is key to their health and development – and to that of their children.
但它也有极限，越过了极限，对央行财务健全性的信心 — — 以及对货币可靠性的信心 — — 就会受到破坏。	But there are limits beyond which confidence in the financial integrity of central banks – and consequently the soundness of money – will be undermined.
中东地区的威胁是巨大的，并且还在上升，全世界的人都在担心极端主义斗士回国以及一直呆在国内的人受恐怖主义影响。	The threat to the region is large and growing, and it menaces people everywhere, as extremist fighters return home and still others who never left are inspired to do terrible things.
发自华盛顿 — — 虽然沙特驻美大使阿德尔·朱拜尔在美国宣称挫败的暗杀阴谋中毫发未伤，但如果这一行动的真正目标并不是朱拜尔，而是为了破坏伊朗总统内贾德的外交政策的话，那么策划者的目的或许已经实现了。	WASHINGTON, DC – Though Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir is alive and well in Washington, the plot to assassinate him may have succeeded – if its aim was not to kill al-Jubeir, but rather Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s foreign policy.
一个不祥的新词已经悄悄潜入生命科学和生物制药研究 ： “ 生物安全 ” （ biosecirity ） 。	An ominous new word has crept into the life sciences and biomedical research: “biosecurity.”
他们让伊斯兰国得以兴盛 — — 甚至助了伊斯兰国一臂之力 — — 并给全球秩序造成日益严重的威胁，在沙姆沙伊赫、贝鲁特和巴黎接连发生的恐怖袭击悲剧地证明了这一点。	They have enabled – indeed, fueled – the rise of the Islamic State, and with it a growing threat to the global order, as the successive terrorist attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Beirut, and Paris tragically have shown.
除非从现在开始，否则战火将会在政治和宗教的助长下蔓延 — — 受害者也决不会仅限于尼尼微（Nineveh ） 。	Unless we start now, the fires will spread – fanned by politics and religion – and it will not only be Nineveh that is consumed by them.
经济学家信心十足地反对商品补贴，因为农业和能源市场接近于完美竞争，需求端有大量消费者，供给端有大量生产者。	Economists feel confident in opposing commodity subsidies because agricultural and energy markets tend to approach the ideal of perfect competition, with a large number of consumers on the demand side and producers on the supply side.
而且认为不必政治解决叙利亚冲突就能实现上述目标是个严重的错误，伊斯兰国实现爆炸性增长恰恰是借助冲突。	And it is a grave mistake to think that this can be achieved without a political solution to the conflict in Syria – the conflict that enabled the organization’s explosive growth.
考虑到遏制气候变化影响的政治压力，聪明的投资者将密切关注可能导致需求下降的政策信号以及他们的资产财务搁浅的可能性。	Given the political pressure to mitigate the impact of climate change, smart investors will be watching closely for indications of policies that will lead to a drop in demand and the possibility that their assets will become financially stranded.
所幸的是，包括学生、主导民意者以及最主要的是律师在内的巴基斯坦人民挺身支持法官，他们在做本来应该由政党来做的工作。	Fortunately, the people of Pakistan – students, opinion makers, and, above all, lawyers – are standing up for the judges, doing the work that should have been done by political parties.
各国政府和国际货币基金组织这样的机构在努力保持可持续经济复苏、为全世界人民谋福利的过程中必须把这一点铭记在心。	Governments and institutions like the IMF must keep this in mind as they seek to ensure a durable economic recovery that will benefit all of the world's people.
他的左翼联盟党（Syriza）在1月的大选中大获全胜，随后希腊总理齐普拉斯任命瓦鲁法基斯领衔与希腊债权人进行如履薄冰的谈判。	Following an impressive election victory by his Syriza party in January, Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, appointed Varoufakis to lead the delicate negotiations with the country’s creditors.
巴勒斯坦人已经从美国总统奥巴马的特使乔治·米切尔处得到了承诺，保证以色列人不会在未来4个月的间接谈判中作出任何“挑衅行动 ” 。	Palestinians have been assured via a message from President Barack Obama, delivered by his special envoy George Mitchell, that the Israelis will not carry out any “provocations” during the coming four months of indirect negotiations.
有些人无疑已经背叛了政府，其中最具影响力的当属霍姆斯暴行达到高潮后不久，能源部副部长辞职并加入到反对派阵营。	To be sure, the authorities have suffered some defections, with the most significant coming soon after the violence in Homs reached its peak, when the deputy energy minister resigned and joined the opposition.
但是如果把这一问题仅仅丢给以色列和巴勒斯坦，那么巴勒斯坦在其1967年的边界内独立的目标将会遥不可及。	But if left to Israelis and Palestinians alone, the goal of Palestinian independence within the 1967 borders of Palestine will most likely remain out of reach.
在CAFTA的规则下，该协议一旦获得批准，80%从美国出口的货物将会免税，所有的关税都会在15年内取消。	Under CAFTA, 80% of US exports will be duty-free as soon as the treaty is ratified, and all tariffs will expire in 15 years.
我现在了解到，如果非洲想实现农业转型，非洲国家首先需要打消让农业部门落后的主要壁垒 — — 普遍存在的性别差距。	What I am now learning is that if Africa hopes to spark an agricultural transformation, countries will first need to remove one of the main barriers holding the sector back: a pervasive gender gap.
也许比特币投机客是下注于永远会找到流氓国家联盟允许使用匿名的比特币，甚至有朝鲜这样的国家会利用比特币。	Perhaps Bitcoin speculators are betting that there will always be a consortium of rogue states allowing anonymous Bitcoin usage, or even state actors such as North Korea that will exploit it.
事实上，在2001年后的十年中推动两位数增长的投资拉动型增长模式加剧了结构性弱点，目前已到了必须纠正的地步。	In fact, the investment-led growth model that facilitated double-digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses, which must now be addressed.
若我签署了引渡申请文件，其意义将是突破性的，因为它将首次向世人昭示，如果司法公正在本国不可能实现，涉嫌侵犯人权者可以在世界任何地方面临审判。	Signing the papers would be groundbreaking, as it would signal for the first time that suspected rights abusers might face trial anywhere in the world if justice was not likely at home.
就在1979年伊朗爆发伊斯兰革命之前没多久，一份美国中情局报告还将伊朗王朝比作“汪洋中不沉的海岛 ” 。	Just before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, a CIA report characterized the Iranian monarchy as an “island of stability.”
这样的目标有点像国家计划经济的遗留 — — 并与政策制定者把新重点放在市场的“决定性作用”背道而驰。	Such targets smack of the legacy of a state-directed economy – a legacy that runs counter to policymakers’ new emphasis on the “decisive role” of markets.
我们可以从这宗案件（和其他多宗类似案件）中推断的是他们是高度传统的农村社会半城市化的产物，在这样的社会中，人，特别是女人的角色是严格限制的。	From what we can surmise from this case – and many others like it – they are the semi-urbanized products of a highly conventional rural society where the roles of men, and especially women, are tightly regulated.
这些条款的真实意图是阻挠旨在保护美国本国经济和公民的卫生、环境、安全以及 — — 是的，甚至还有金融监管。	The real intent of these provisions is to impede health, environmental, safety, and, yes, even financial regulations meant to protect America’s own economy and citizens.
伊斯坦布尔—在不断向外扩张的大都市伊斯坦布尔有一个塔克西姆广场（Taksim Square ） ， 塔克西姆广场有一个小公园，它是市中心硕果仅存的几处绿色空间之一。	ISTANBUL – The small park in Taksim Square in the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul is one of the few green spaces left in the city center.
每一项研究都解释了绿色经济的一部份，没有一个能涵盖整体 — — 这不是因为这些研究有缺陷，只不过因为这件事已经完全超出了我们的能力之外。	Each of the studies describes a part of a green economy, but none can capture the whole – not because they are deficient, but because it is simply beyond our capability.
如果日本、美国和其他国家试图拦截或者回击朝鲜发射的导弹，那么，军事紧张局势 — — 甚至是可能的对抗 — — 就非常可能会接踵而来。	If Japan, the US, and others attempt to intercept or counter the missile, military tension – even possible combat – is likely to ensue.
2009—2012年希腊政府每季度支出攀升至135亿欧元左右的高峰，然后在2014—2015年下降至96亿美元左右。	Greek government spending per quarter climbed to a plateau of around €13.5 billion ($14.8 billion) in 2009-2012, before falling to roughly €9.6 billion in 2014-2015.
就在一个月前，南亚发生海啸，有关人员死亡、灾民受难以及各种基础设施遭受严重破坏的报道占据了此次海啸报道的主题。	Reports about the tsunamis that devastated Southeast Asia barely a month ago have understandably been dominated by tales of death, suffering, and the physical destruction of infrastructure.
因此即便欧盟体现了我们为确保欧洲在日渐艰难的时势中保持竞争力的良好愿望，它依然受到“为危机全球化推波助澜”的指责。	So, although the EU represents our best hope of ensuring that Europe is internationally competitive in today’s increasingly difficult environment, it is actually being blamed for globalization.
当然， 人们应当注意到，如果资源丰富的非洲经济改革进展得如同亚洲那样，那么，高涨的基本商品价格时代就将会推迟一个世纪。	Of course, it should be noted that if economic reform in resource-rich Africa had been proceeding at the same pace as in Asia, the era of soaring commodity prices might have been postponed for another century.
事实上，辅助性原则 — — 决策应该在尽可能地方的层面发生 — — 对于能良好运转的灵活的全球治理至关重要。	Indeed, the principle of subsidiarity – whereby decision-making should occur at the most local level possible – is crucial to flexible, functioning global governance.
然而除了勉强承认其关于喜马拉雅冰川的预测是“有悖事实”之外， IPCC 没有承认任何其他的错漏 — — 更遑论为此而道歉了。	Yet, aside from a grudging admission that its predictions about Himalayan glaciers were “poorly substantiated,” the IPCC has yet to acknowledge – much less apologize for – any of the lapses.
而肯尼亚无处不在的移动银行服务M-Pesa显然让贫困妇女能够从小农经济转向非农业经济，从而为最底层民众带来了显著收入增长。	Kenya’s ubiquitous mobile banking service M-Pesa appears to have enabled poor women to move out of subsistence agriculture into non-farm businesses, providing a significant bump up the income ladder at the very bottom.
尽管广泛利润分享计划表现出诸多好处，但只有三分之一的美国私营部门员工参与其中，并且只有大约20%持有本公司股票。	Despite the demonstrated benefits of broad-based profit-sharing programs, only about one-third of US private-sector workers participate in them, and about 20% own stock in their companies.
如果我们认识到创新来自理解地方情况和优化私人部门的巨量资源，我们就能确保未来更好的健康情况 — — 和更快的经济增长。	If we recognize that innovation stems from understanding local conditions and optimizing the vast resources of the private sector, we can ensure better health – and more rapid economic growth – far into the future.
2016年，发达国家应该同意接受每年总数接近100万的难民，方式可以是安置，也可以是提供人道、学生、劳工和其他签证。	In 2016, developed countries should agree to accept a combined total approaching a million refugees annually, either through resettlement or by issuing humanitarian, student, labor, and other visas.
由拉美人、东欧犹太人、意大利人、亚洲人、爱尔兰人和现在依然对牛津剑桥的双桨滑过查尔斯河河水魂牵梦绕的英裔美国人共同组成了伟大的美国民众。	In the United States, it is that great people composed of Latinos, Eastern European Jews, Italians, Asians, Irish, and, yes, Anglos still dreaming of Oxford-Cambridge sculls now cleaving the waters of the Charles River.
2010年以来房地产投资减少带来的负面影响比预期深远。 事实的确如此，几乎所有在8月下跌超过10%的各类进口项目都与房地产投资有关。	The negative impact of the fall in real-estate investment since 2010 has been deeper and longer than expected; indeed, almost all categories of imports that fell by 10% or more in August were related to real-estate investment.
与此同时，他们的行为 — — 以及其他银行家的类似行为 — — 却直接导致了住宅价格的上涨以及随后的毁灭性崩溃。	At the same time, their actions – and similar actions by other bankers – are directly responsible for both the run-up in housing prices and the damaging collapse that followed.
和这种个人化相关的大脑区域是从我们的贸易伙伴还是小型氏族团体成员的时候开始进化的。 在那样的情况下，违反道德的行为会被即时发现并加以纠正。	This personalization draws upon regions of the brain that evolved when our trading partners were members of small kin-based groups where moral violations were immediately identified and remedied.
这就解释了美国的房地产，纽约、伦敦和法兰克福的股票，世界各地的长期债券与人们认可的传统基本价值之间形成的巨大落差。	This explains the large gaps between current prices for real estate in the US, equities in New York, London, and Frankfurt, and long-term bonds everywhere and what one would conventionally think their fundamental values should be.
苏格兰微生物学家亚历山大·弗莱明（Alexander Fleming）发现能够杀死细菌的菌类后不久就认识到，过度使用抗生素会引起耐药性。	Not long after the Scottish microbiologist Alexander Fleming discovered a fungus that could kill bacteria, he recognized that overuse of antibiotics would encourage resistance.
如今，中国正意欲把核心利益一词用于与日本的钓鱼岛之争，甚至不顾危险地将它用于对整个南海的主张：事实上，一些军官已经在这么用了。	Now China is attempting to apply the same term to the Senkaku Islands in its dispute with Japan, and is perilously close to making the same claim for the entire South China Sea; indeed, some Chinese military officers already have.
纽约 — — 1945年广岛和长崎被毁标志着一个时代的结束和另一个时代的开始。 二战结束后冷战开始，世界小心翼翼地维护着摇摇欲坠的和平。	NEW YORK – The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 marked an end and a beginning. The close of the Second World War ushered in a Cold War, with a precarious peace based on the threat of mutually assured destruction.
正如萨默斯所警告的，坚持这样做只能在不可避免的失败前造成“不必要的痛苦 ” ， 让希腊（其实远不止希腊）崩溃。	Staying the course, as Summers warns, will lead only to “needless suffering” before that course inevitably collapses, bringing Greece – and much else –­ crashing down.
中国正处于结构转型中，必须警惕避免经济增长对既存增长源泉的削弱，以免掉入结构性陷阱造成结构转型成本过高，抵消转型的好处。	China is in the midst of that process, and it must be careful not to undermine existing sources of growth lest it fall into a structural trap where the cost of transition itself derails new gains.
简而言之，西方的对乌战略应该是在大选之前刺激该国经济，然后再与大选后建立的政府谈判建立一个改革方案。	In short, the Western strategy for Ukraine should be to stimulate the Ukrainian economy until the May election and then negotiate a package of reforms with the government that emerges.
我们面临的挑战是向年轻人证明我们很容易被恐怖分子的诉求所影响 — — 恐怖分子会告诉我们，有更好的办法让你的声音被听到，你可以通过更有意义的方式参与到世界中去。	The challenge is to show young people who are vulnerable to appeals from terrorists that there is a better path to having their voice heard, a more meaningful way to engage with the world.
随着21世纪的深入，大部分发达国家都将经历人口短缺，但美国是其中少数可能避免人口下降、维持其世界人口比例的国家之一。	Whereas most developed countries will experience a shortage of people as the century progresses, America is one of the few that may avoid demographic decline and maintain its share of world population.
因此即便企业更容易得到钱和贷款，许多公司依然不愿意大规模招人，因此害怕在未来经济下滑时要背上一张巨额工资单。	Hence, even if businesses get easier access to money and loans, many firms will still decline to hire on a large scale, fearing that they would be saddled with a large payroll in a future downturn.
伊朗觊觎核武器能力并且指使其什叶派代理人好战份子，不仅威胁以色列以及该地区，而且还在寻求僭取温和的逊尼派阿拉伯政权传统的巴勒斯坦人保护人的角色。	Iran not only threatens Israel (and the region) with its desire for a nuclear capability and its Shi’a proxy militants; it is also seeking to usurp the traditional role of moderate Sunni Arab regimes as the Palestinians’ defenders.
跟医学一样，经济学也被划分成许多不同的门类 — — 宏观经济学家一般不会关注金融经济学家或地产经济学家究竟在干什么，反之亦然。	Like medicine, economics has become highly compartmentalized – macroeconomists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real-estate economists study, and vice versa.
面对如此的现实，住在赫尔辛基的公务员Jiri Räsänen刚开始也同样感到沮丧，但随后他和他的朋友们想到了一个好主意：为什么不能在保留汽车的前提下，而只是更换发动机呢？	That fact at first depressed Jiri Räsänen, a civil servant in Helsinki – but then it gave him and his friends a good idea. Why not keep the cars but replace their engines?
美国石油生产商的补贴常常打着国家安全旗号；事实上 ， “ 先耗尽美国”的政策从长期看降低了能源自给率。	Subsidies to US oil producers have often been sold on national-security grounds; in fact, a policy to “drain America first” reduces self-sufficiency in the longer run.
美国对日本的出口几乎100％都是以美元计价的，意味着这些出口就像弗里德曼的版本一样是对美元有粘性的。	Almost 100% of US exports to Japan are priced in dollars, meaning that they, as in Friedman’s version, are sticky in dollars.
从根本上来说，它必须采用一个以规则为基础的机制来处理与两个邻国的关系，而也是中国政府对此患得患失的原因。	In essence, it would have to accept a rules-based system for its relations with its two neighbors, something of which China’s government has been wary.
它们的邻国中不乏深陷内部冲突或艰难转型者，国内不满情绪也在不断升级。 海湾国家急切地想平息革命浪潮。	With their neighbors embroiled in internal conflict or in the midst of difficult transitions, and with discontent rising at home, the Gulf states are eager to stem the tide of revolution.
而国会预算办公室则预计美国的财政赤字将在未来十年平均维持在GDP的5%左右，并因此导致政府债务占GDP的比例从2009年度的低于60%上升到90 % 。	The Congressional Budget Office projects that the country’s fiscal deficit will average 5% of GDP for the rest of the decade, driving government debt to 90% of GDP, from less than 60% of GDP in 2009.
但那些新一代马尔萨斯主义者反对将这些巨大的利益扩展到世界更多地方，因为他们认为全球变暖状况是如此恶劣以致必须去阻止增长。	The latter-day Malthusians are opposed to extending these tremendous benefits to more of the world because they believe that global warming will be so bad that it justifies stopping growth.
波兰、匈牙利和土耳其政府越来越极权，和巴尔干国家、中国和俄罗斯的领导人一样，它们越来越热衷于控制公共话题。	The governments of Poland, Hungary, and Turkey have become increasingly authoritarian and – like leaders in the Balkans, China, and Russia – increasingly eager to control public discourse.
食品价格通胀达到了两位数，人们对有多大比例的印度人生活在贫困线以下甚至贫困县应该划在什么水平争论不休。	Double-digit food-price inflation has been accompanied by debate about the share of Indians living below the poverty line, and, indeed, where the poverty line should be drawn.
20世纪90年代，发展中国家增长开始总体快于发达国家（用人均标准衡量 ） ， 这让很多人乐观地认为这两类国家的产出和收入将会趋于一致。	In the 1990s, developing economies, taken as a whole, began to grow faster than their advanced counterparts (in per capita terms), inspiring optimism that the two groups’ output and income would converge.
埃及前总统萨拉特对耶路撒冷的访问，以及以埃两国随后在美国戴维营达成的突破性成果，都是在双方前期私下取得谅解之后发生的。	The visit to Jerusalem of Egypt's then-President Anwar el-Sadat, and the ensuing Egypt-Israel breakthrough at Camp David, took place only after successful behind-the-scenes understandings.
而这个引发众多争议的提议 — — 其中最著名的倡议者是约翰•凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes ） — —要求为初级商品建立一个“缓冲库存 ” ， 当价格下跌时吸纳产品，反之则增加供应量。	This argument inspired proposals – most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 – to create “buffer stocks” for the main commodities, which would take supply off the market when prices fell, and add to supply when prices rose.
与此同时，2001年，利用美国专利商标局反应慢的弱点，Proctor对科罗拉多州16家小型种子公司提出侵犯专利权的诉讼。	Meanwhile, in 2001, taking advantage of the USPTO’s slow response, Proctor sued 16 small seed companies in Colorado for patent-infringement.
欧洲一体化就是多边全球主义实验的核心；随着法国与德国和解，欧洲这个自古以来冲突不断的地带成为了模范合作者的土地。	European integration was at the core of this experiment in multilateral globalism; with Franco-German reconciliation, Europe, a chronic conflict zone, became a region of exemplary cooperators.
事实上，自2008年初以来，平均年化真实消费支出增长只有1.3 % — —为有记录以来消费增长最萎靡的阶段。	In fact, since early 2008, annualized growth in real consumer expenditure has averaged a mere 1.3% – the most anemic period of consumption growth on record.
北京吸引了中国最顶尖的政治评论家，他们不喜欢讨论那些单调的宗教议题，而耶路撒冷的社会评论家则致力于解读那些将人们团结在一起的宗教。	Beijing attracts China’s leading political critics, while Jerusalem’s social critics argue for an interpretation of religion that holds people, rather than inanimate objects, sacred.
但自 20 世纪 90 年代起，后退速度有所回落，因为一些知名大冰川，如根戈德里冰川和锡亚琴冰川的后退 ， “ 在 2007~2009 年期间实际上已经处于停滞状态 。 ”	But the retreat slowed after the mid-1990’s until, for some of the biggest and best-known glaciers, such as Gangotri and Siachen, it had “practically come to a standstill during the period 2007-2009.”
根据新气候经济（New Climate Economy）计划的数据，到2030年全球基础设施投资将达到89万亿美元 — — 而要让这些投资变得低碳而高恢复力，必须在增加4.1万亿美元投资。	According to the New Climate Economy initiative, $89 trillion will be spent on global infrastructure investment by 2030 – with an additional $4.1 trillion needed to make it low-carbon and resilient.
欧洲是一个地理和历史的独特结合体，但是欧洲的边界 — — 以及它未来扩大的前景 — — 是由成员国的容纳能力和适应能力所决定的。	Europe is a peculiar combination of geography and history, but the boundaries of the EU – and thus the prospects for its further enlargement – are determined by its absorptive capacity and the adaptive abilities of candidate countries.
比方说我们可以通过重点研究各器官特性来加深对器官和组织包块或对肝脏、胰腺等器官脂肪浸润的理解，而避免把注意力放在全身的总体得分上。	We can understand more about organ and tissue masses, for example, or fatty infiltrations in individual organs like the liver and pancreas, by focusing on the nature of each body component, rather than by relying on an overall body score.
发自墨尔本 — — 许多年前，当我和太太开车载着三个年幼的女儿出行时，其中一个突然问了一句 ： “ 爸爸妈妈你们是希望我们聪明一点呢，还是快乐一点呢 ？ ”	MELBOURNE – Many years ago, my wife and I were driving somewhere with our three young daughters in the back, when one of them suddenly asked: “Would you rather that we were clever or that we were happy?”
2013年，增税、隔离程序要求的政府支出削减、政府临时关门以及有约束力的赤字上限可能要求政府进一步削减支出对经济产生了拖累。	The economy in 2013 was held back by tax increases, government spending cuts mandated by the sequester process, the temporary government shutdown, and the possibility that a binding debt ceiling would require further cuts in government outlays.
他希望德国能够脱离纳粹主义，纳粹主义能被摧毁的同时而德国不被摧毁，从而让这个伟大国家作为抵御苏联的桥头堡。	He hoped that Germany could be separated from Nazism, that Nazism could be destroyed without destroying Germany, thus preserving that great nation as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.
他甚至宣称为自己并未强制执行“红线 ” — —在2012年就叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德（Bashar al-Assad）的使用化学武器而划定的界限 — — 而感到自豪，因为无论国际法还是美国国会都不会批准实施干预。	He even claimed to be proud of not enforcing the “red line” he had drawn in 2012 regarding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, as neither international law nor the US Congress would have sanctioned intervention.
由于起领导作用的国家不能或者不愿 — — 究竟属于哪种情况已经很难搞清 — — 继续管理日益增加的资金流，导致布雷顿森林体系于20世纪70年代陷入崩溃。	The Bretton Woods regime collapsed in the 1970’s as a result of the inability or unwillingness – it is not entirely clear which – of leading governments to manage the growing tide of capital flows.
他们的关注点应该被聆听和讨论；有时禁止最好辅之以国民教育方面的新措施，比如强调移民并没有导致希腊的萧条。	Their concerns should be heard and debated; and sometimes banning is best combined with renewed efforts at civic education, emphasizing, for example, that immigrants did not cause Greece’s woes.
2003—2004年，日本财务省购买了大量美元，从而在日本银行不愿采取公开市场操作的情况下放松了货币条件。	From 2003 to 2004, the Japanese treasury purchased a large amount of dollars, thereby easing monetary conditions at a time when the BOJ was reluctant to pursue open market operations.
另一大复杂性叙利亚的少数派阿拉维派统治着占多数的逊尼派，这使得叙利亚成为什叶派伊朗在逊尼派阿拉伯世界中的代理。	Another is Alawite-minority rule in a Sunni-majority country, which makes Syria a proxy for Shia Iran in the Sunni Arab world.
此外欧洲还有很深的研究人才储备 — — 全球最顶尖的十家计算机科学研究所中有五家位于欧盟 — — 欧洲的创业繁荣看上去可以维持。	Add to that deep research talent – five of the top ten global computer science faculties are within the EU – and Europe’s start-up boom looks sustainable.
气候变化不是我们国家为了保持自然之美而必须克服的最令人生畏的挑战 — — 哥斯达黎加是每平方米生物多样性最好的国家之一。	Climate change is not the first daunting challenge our country – among the world’s most biodiverse countries per square meter – has had to overcome to preserve its natural beauty.
同时，在美国的财政系统中，国税要占总税收的三分之二，这意味着收入暂时下降的州可以自动且持续地获得净财政转移支持。	The recent collapse of those bubbles caused sharp downturns in economic activity and substantial increases in unemployment in both countries.
这部分是因为欧洲实行高税收，任何人对此都无能为力：如果人们认为自己拿回家的报酬太低，而边际税率太高，没有人能强迫他们去工作。	This is partly due to higher taxes in Europe, and this cannot be undone: nobody can force someone to work if they consider their take-home pay too low because of a high marginal tax rate.
前总统克林顿曾说他为未能充分应对1994年卢旺达爆发的种族灭绝危机而感到遗憾，尽管应该遗憾的人还有很多。	Former President Bill Clinton has said that he regrets his failure to respond adequately to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, although he was not alone.
与此同时，法国和荷兰民众的声音也不应该被忽视，尤其是因为在它们中随便哪一个国家就同一个文本进行二次全民公决都是不可想象的事情。	At the same time, French and Dutch citizens’ voices cannot be ignored – all the more so because it is unimaginable that an identical text could be submitted to a second referendum in either country.
罗姆尼最近承认了这一点，承认“财政断崖 ” — —布什时代的税收减免将于今年年底前结束，再加上已经预定实施的大规模开支削减计划 — — 将联合起来把经济推入衰退。	Romney conceded this point recently, acknowledging that the “fiscal cliff” – the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts at the end of this year, combined with large spending cuts already scheduled to take effect – would push the economy back into recession.
在这一不确定性面前，企业部门在风险最高、资本最密集的投资已经完成之前，或在出现清晰的系统性信号之前是不会进入市场的。	In the face of such uncertainty, the business sector will not enter the market until the riskiest and most capital-intensive investments have been made, or until coherent and systematic political signals have been communicated.
对日本来说，这将是沉重一击，而如果特朗普兑现竞选承诺，要求日本和韩国等盟国增加自身防御的“保护费”日本的损失还会更大。	That will be a big loss for Japan, and the country will lose out even more if Trump follows through on his campaign promise to make allies such as Japan and South Korea pay more for their own defense.
这些新的威胁，正如在‘第三帝国’统治下那样对人类生命表现出同样的蔑视并对建立一种对全世界的独裁表现出同样的渴望 。 ”	These new threats, just as under the Third Reich, show the same contempt for human life and the same aspiration to establish an exclusive dictate over the world.”
但由于预期会因应央行行为做出调整，所以自由裁量的货币政策其实是无效的 — — 只会产生较高的通胀率却缺乏产出或就业增长。	But, because expectations adjust to central bank behavior, discretionary monetary policy is futile: it yields higher inflation but no output or employment increases.
由于许多经济部门缺乏竞争力且教育体系不完善，沙特人口 — — 其中70%不到35岁 — — 将在今后几年经历爆发式失业潮。	Given many economic sectors’ lack of competitiveness and the inadequacy of the educational system, the Saudi population – 70% of which is under 35 years old – will experience skyrocketing unemployment in the coming years.
最近几年，扩大疫苗项目进展迅速，这一信息代表了全球社会的独特机会，特别是在我们即将彻底消灭小儿麻痹症时。	Given the progress made in expanding vaccination programs in recent years, this revelation represents a unique opportunity for the global community, particularly as we begin to close the lid on polio.
所有这些都表明，要么是大选后的跛脚鸭国会会议上，要么在新国会产生后的最初几个月，美国政客可能会消除财政悬崖。	All of this suggests that, whether in the lame-duck congressional session following the elections or in the first few months of the new Congress, US politicians will likely dismantle the fiscal cliff.
为支持经济增长和发展，我们需要发掘所有劳动者的潜力，不仅授予女性赚钱的机会，而且要让她们担负起领导职责。	To support economic growth and development, we need to tap the potential of all workers, giving women opportunities not just to earn, but also to lead.
出席就职典礼的人数 — — 远远少于特朗普愿意相信的规模 — — 可以从现成的证据（包括国家广场的照片和地铁乘客人数等）很容易地推断。	The number of people who attended the inauguration – far less than Trump wanted to believe – could easily be inferred from the available evidence (including photographs of the National Mall and the number of subway riders).
流言通过社交媒体传播，特别是WhatsApp，这导致无辜的人因为被控宰牛、绑架儿童或更恶劣的行为而被暴民处以私刑。	Rumors forwarded via social media, especially on WhatsApp, have led to mob lynchings of innocent people falsely accused of being cow slaughterers, child kidnappers, or worse.
这是因为，最初的平静时期常常以腐败堕落滋生以及革命目标的倒退为标志，导致理想主义者感到革命失去了方向。	This is because the initial quiet period is often marked by corruption and a retreat from revolutionary goals, leading idealists to feel that the revolution is losing its way.
杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）和沃尔特·白芝浩（Walter Bagehot）就是反对派阵营中的两大巨头。	Two notable holdouts are Jamie Dimon and Walter Bagehot.
在经过多年徒劳地试图和平解决争端，以及十几次根据谈判者的部署而推出的官方以及不公开渠道的和平计划后，能够创造性地达成协议的空间已经非常小了。	After years of frustrated attempts to reach a settlement, and with dozens of official and back-channel peace plans at the negotiators’ disposal, there remains little room for creativity in producing an agreement.
更为引人注目的模式是美国人对实际流动性较低的部分地区 — — 包括乔治亚，阿拉巴马，弗吉尼亚，北卡罗来纳和南卡罗来纳等东南部各州 — — 的社会流动性过于乐观。	An even more striking pattern is that Americans are overly optimistic about social mobility in parts of the country where actual mobility is low – including the southeastern states of Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
说到底，AI的未来（future of AI ） — —我们的AI未来（AI future ） — —是光明的。	Ultimately, the future of AI – our AI future – is bright.
加尔布雷斯观察到，占款私用（embezzlement）有一种性质，即“罪行犯下和发现之间会有几周、几个月或几年的时滞。	Embezzlement, Galbraith observed, has the property that “weeks, months, or years elapse between the commission of the crime and its discovery.
相反，俄罗斯是更典型的民族安全国家（National Security State ） ， 撩拨西方的焦虑以巩固其对乌克兰的控制，以官方民族主义镇压国内反对者。	Russia, by contrast, is a more classic National Security State, now playing Western anxieties like a fiddle to consolidate its tightening grip on Ukraine and suppress domestic opposition with a tide of official nationalism.
在这样的背景下，很难解释为何欧洲央行要继续坚持非常规货币政策措施 — — 比如负利率和不断地购买债券。	Against this background, it is difficult to explain why the ECB continues to insist that unconventional monetary-policy measures – such as negative rates and continued bond purchases – are needed.
我们只不过尚未具备足够的深刻洞察力去理解在一场遥远的变革 — — 不管是一场金融危机还是爆发式增长 — — 中所有的因素将如何互动。	We simply do not yet have sufficiently precise insights into how all of its elements interact during times of far-reaching change, whether it be a financial crisis or a growth spurt.
卡尔加里—当哈维·库欣（Harvey Cushing）和威廉·博威（William Bovie）于1926年引入电灼（用高频电流封闭血管或制造切口 ） ， 他们的创新改变了神经外科学。	CALGARY – When Harvey Cushing and William Bovie introduced electrocautery (which uses a high-frequency current to seal blood vessels or make incisions) in 1926, their innovation transformed neurosurgery.
1989年，在爱沙尼亚之旅中（当时爱沙尼亚仍是苏联的一部分 ） ， 我要的翻译 — — 一位兼职牙医带我去她的牙科诊所。	In 1989, during a trip to Estonia – then still a part of the Soviet Union – I asked my interpreter, a moonlighting dentist, to take me to her dental clinic.
我们不知道下一场危机何时发生，在哪里发生，但我们能知道它会发生 — — 并且我们必须在它发生时做出更好的准备。	We do not know when and where the next crisis will erupt, but we do know that it will – and that we must be better prepared when it does.
因此 ， 《 利维坦》由俄罗斯文化部拨出部分资金 — — 并且表示俄罗斯当局对赢得奥斯卡奖不感兴趣 — — 显得颇为讽刺。	So it is ironic that Leviathan was partly financed by Russia's culture ministry – and telling that the Russian authorities had no interest in its winning at the Oscars.
比如，如果实际发生在2012年初的伦敦鲸交易发生在2008年金融系统孱弱不堪时，JPM就会被网开一面。	The London Whale trades, for example, were from early 2012; had they occurred in 2008, when the financial system was fragile, JPM, it is said, would have gotten a legal pass.
我会尽快派遣一支欧洲开放社会计划需求评估团队到希腊与当局（及已经在帮助需要者的民众和组织）联系，以便制定一项能争取公众支持的计划。	As soon as possible, I will dispatch an OSIFE needs-assessment team to Greece to contact the authorities – and the people and organizations already helping the needy – to work out a plan for which we can generate public support.
毕竟，这项政策不是由国土安全部门制定的，而是由特朗普的首席战略顾问、自命为文化斗士的史蒂芬·班农（Stephen Bannon）制定的。	After all, the policy was designed not by the domestic security establishment, but by Trump’s chief strategist, the avowed culture warrior Stephen Bannon.
诺贝尔奖获得者、农学家布劳格（Norman Borlaug）用公共资金开发的新的“绿色革命”种子可以被世界各地的使用者免费获得。	The new “Green Revolution” seeds that the Nobel laureate agronomist Norman Borlaug developed with public money were freely available to all users anywhere.
我们的方法II的理性总是能够指向每个理性的个人都会同意的最优选择的��蒙观点，和多数 合理 选择这一广泛接受的现代观点相冲突。	The Enlightenment idea that our System-II rationality can always point to an optimal choice about which every reasonable individual would agree clashes with the widely accepted modern idea that there is a plurality of reasonable choices.
事实上，就在上周，福克斯新闻主播比尔·奥莱利尽管拥有美国最受欢迎的有线电视真人秀，但却依然失去了工作。 因为广告商面对团结一致的民众压力而迅速抛弃了他。	Indeed, just last week, the Fox News host Bill O’Reilly lost his job, despite having America’s most popular cable news show, when advertisers, facing concerted grassroots pressure, quickly deserted him.
最有效的征税方法之一是美国工资税，该税种的边际税率接近于平均税率（因为不存在减税，税率结构的累进性也较低 ） 。	One of the most efficient tax-raising methods is the US payroll tax, for which the marginal tax rate is close to the average rate (because deductions are absent and there is little graduation in the rate structure).
这就要求人们更加深入地理解技术驱动的结构变化，科技巨头要与政府同步理解并对其日益提升的系统重要性做出调整。	This demands deeper comprehension of technology-driven structural changes, with Big Tech recognizing and adjusting to its growing systemic importance in step with government.
自Facebook 和Twitter被曝光在2016年美国总统竞选期间起着传播假消息和炮制不信任和种族对立的关键作用以来，越来越多的人要求加强监管。	Since the revelations that Facebook and Twitter played a key role in disseminating false information and sowing mistrust and racial tension in the 2016 US election, a growing chorus has called for stricter regulations.
阿萨德政权将垂死挣扎转化为种族和宗派冲突的行径将对整个地区造成严重的破坏，而首当其冲受到影响的就是巴嫩和伊拉克等邻国。	The regime’s effort to turn its struggle for survival into an ethnic and sectarian conflict could wreak havoc across the region, starting with neighbors like Lebanon and Iraq.
中国政府不愿人民币快速升值可能是因为其厌恶不可预知的大幅波动，特别是在其准备将人民币推向国际储备货币地位的时候。	The Chinese government’s reluctance to allow faster exchange-rate appreciation may reflect its aversion to large, unforeseeable fluctuations, particularly given its determination to make the renminbi an international reserve currency.
全球化的受益者通常用促进新活动、有利于实体经济而不是金融的政策，以及强调高生产率就业的连续改革的战略来对全球化进行补充。	The beneficiaries of globalization are typically those countries that complemented it with a strategy to promote new activities, policies that favored the real economy over finance, and sequential reforms that emphasized high-productivity employment.
尽管传统上贸易被认为是决定汇率的主要因素，汇率涨跌通常被认为可以纠正一国的对外贸易失衡，但当今资本跨境流动规模已经非常庞大，它们对汇率的冲击比以前大很多 。	While trade is supposed to be the primary driver of exchange rates, which should rise or fall to correct countries’ external imbalances, capital flows have grown to the point that their role in guiding exchange rates is now much larger.
比方说非洲和印度乡下都有不少自行车维修点、报摊和小商店，可以对店主进行培训，让他们学会安装并维护这些系统。	For example, bicycle mechanics, who are plentiful in Africa and rural India, or small shop and kiosk owners could be trained to install and maintain these systems.
“伊拉克名单”在2010年3月的议会选举中赢得的席位最多，但其领导人，前总理伊亚德·阿拉维将不会再任旧职。	Iraqiya won the largest share of seats in the March 2010 parliamentary elections, yet its leader, former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, will not return to his old job.
这表明，尽管释放囚犯可以促成短期协议，但并没有带来旨在形成基于信任的、能带来持续和平的协议的真正努力。	This suggests that, while the prisoner release may lead to a short-term agreement, it is not backed by a genuine effort to develop the kind of trust-based arrangements that are needed for lasting peace.
如果发动袭击的主要理由是人道主义（结束对叙利亚平民的毫无意义的屠杀 ） ， 美国军事干预将弊大于利。	If the main justification for an attack is humanitarian – to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians – US military intervention would do more harm than good.
除了叙利亚，两大问题将决定新中东的未来：穆斯林兄弟会治下的埃及的道路以及伊朗核计划和地区角色图谋冲突的结果。	Along with Syria, two issues will determine this new Middle East’s future: Egypt’s path under the Muslim Brotherhood, and the outcome of confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program and regional role.
现在，我们可以发现一些对人类观察者来说不那么容易发现的新模式 — — 这已经为我们带来降低能源消费和二氧化碳排放的方法。	We can now find new patterns that are not readily evident to the human observer – and this already suggests ways to lower energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
日本要求其航空公司无视中国有关航班预先通知的要求，中国要求一切航班均需预先通知，即使这些航班只是途径新识别区，而不是飞往中国领空。	Japan has asked its airlines to ignore China’s demand for advance notification of flights, even if they are merely transiting the new zone and not heading toward Chinese territorial airspace.
这一次，美国十分愿意通过充分的合作来促进海地的经济发展：再发生一连串的事故只能引起混乱，包括大量新的难民流入美国。	This time, the US has a strong interest in cooperating fully to promote economic progress: another round of failure would only provoke chaos, including massive numbers of new refugees to the US.
但不妨换一个角度看待危机和我们的金融机构：金融系统距离悬崖边缘从未如此之远，即使是在2008年之前。 这是因为税收制度鼓励金融企业过度负债。	But consider another way of viewing the crisis and our financial institutions: the financial system was never all that far from the cliff’s edge, even before 2008, because the tax system encouraged financial firms to overload themselves with debt.
但满足民众安全需求所需的多数政策都超出了国家政府的能力范畴，特别是当这些政府自己还在想办法适应的时候。	But most of the policy responses needed to meet people’s demand for greater security are beyond the scope and reach of national governments, especially when these governments are trying to cope on their own.
中国领导人将中国对印度的不对称贸易关系 — — 出口比进口高五倍多 — — 视为破坏其对手的制造业基础，同时还能斩获可观的利润的战略武器。	Chinese leaders value the lopsided trade relationship with India – exports are more than five times higher than imports – as a strategic weapon to undercut its rival’s manufacturing base while reaping handsome profits.
丹佛 — — 从4月27日韩国总统文在寅和朝鲜总统金正恩举行最高首脑会晤以来，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普就一直不遗余力地想要证明自己才是朝韩外交背后的策划者，这一点丝毫也不出人意料。	DENVER – Since the April 27 summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump has sought, unsurprisingly, to portray himself as the mastermind behind inter-Korean diplomacy.
类似地，1987年至1993年巴勒斯坦第一次抵抗运动（Intifada）后，以色列国防界领导了和平努力。	Similarly, in the aftermath of the first Intifada, the Palestinian uprising that lasted from 1987 to 1993, the defense establishment led the effort for peace.
德国现在得求神拜佛，希望人们 — — 德国选民和中国基金管理者 — — 现在把这些承诺当真，又在十年后把它们忘掉。	The best hope for Germany is that people – both German voters and Chinese fund managers – will take such promises seriously now, but forget about them in ten years.
即使是他对缅甸的历史性访问 — — 他是第一个访问该国的美国总统 — — 对贸易的关注也将不亚于促使这个具有战略地理重要性的资源丰富国家摆脱中国的影响。	Even his historic visit to Myanmar – the first ever by a US president – is as much about trade as it is about weaning a strategically located, resource-rich country from Chinese influence.
阿富汗战争造成美军伤亡人数比前几场战争都要少，但人力成本仍然非常巨大 — — 特别是在考虑到阿富汗方面的伤亡后。	While the war in Afghanistan may have resulted in fewer American deaths and injuries than previous US wars, the human cost remains substantial – especially after factoring in Afghan deaths and injuries.
至于中国的银行，主要问题似乎是地方政府债务膨胀带来的，根据政府数据，截止2010年底的地方政府债务总值达1.7万亿美元（约占GDP30%的份额 ） 。	As for Chinese banks, the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local-government debt, which, according to the government, totaled $1.7 trillion (roughly 30% of GDP) at the end of 2010.
新的奥巴马政府提出了开支计划，其中赤字超过一万亿美元，这会创下新的纪录。 而这还是在刚离任的布什政府已经创下了有史以来的最高赤字之后。	The new Obama administration is proposing spending plans that would create a record US deficit of more than one trillion dollars – and this coming on top of the outgoing Bush administration’s record deficit.
这样对移民进行攻击或许能够带来一些即时的政治利益，但是最终结果必定会使社会分裂，而社会的凝聚力已经受到了经济危机严重影响。	Such attacks on immigration might offer some instant political gratification, but their net result is to cleave societies whose cohesion is already seriously challenged by the economic crisis.
去年乌克兰的经常帐户赤字约为GDP的8.3 % ， 导致其外汇储备不断减少，仅能维持两个月的进口所需。	Its current-account deficit last year was an estimated 8.3% of GDP, and its foreign-currency reserves are quickly being depleted, covering just over two months of imports.
诺贝尔经济学奖获得者阿玛蒂亚·森强调：大多数饥荒发生时粮食都并非真的紧缺，而是未能把粮食运到需要的人们手中，这在很大程度上是因为他们缺乏购买力。	The Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen has emphasized that most famines are associated not with a shortage of food, but the failure to get food to the people who need it, largely because they lack purchasing power.
过度储蓄又没有面临增加支出的市场压力的债权经济体，以及过度支出并面临市场压力、被迫增加储蓄的债务经济体，它们之间的不对称调整也放大了需求短缺。	So has the asymmetric adjustment between over-saving creditor economies that face no market pressure to spend more, and over-spending debtor economies that do face market pressure and have been forced to save more.
这种极端主义也正在缓慢但逐步地孕育着自己的反对力量，正如我们看到反伊斯兰政党在欧洲大选中逐渐得势，而欧洲领导人关于文化多元化的宣言都沦为废纸。	This extremism is, slowly but surely, producing its own reaction, as we see from Islamaphobic parties’ electoral gains in Europe, and statements by European leaders that multiculturalism has failed.
美国银行手上还有第三张合约（假设对手是贝尔斯登 ） ， 这张合约通过清算所进行，价值1亿美元，但亏损方是贝尔斯登。	BofA also has a contract with, say, Bear Stearns through the clearinghouse for $100 million, with Bear Stearns on the losing end.
他似乎更不会因为将其政府带入一场国际会议而与以色列交恶，就像他的父亲在1991年时与沙米尔总理之间那样。	Nor does he seem eager to open a rift with Israel by dragging its government to an international conference, the way his father did with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1991.
这时，约翰·斯诺（John Snow）挺身而出。 他是一位有开创精神的医生，直觉地认为霍乱不是如同传统智慧认为的那样通过空气传播，而是通过水传播。	Enter John Snow, a pioneering physician who had intuited that cholera was spread not through the air, as conventional wisdom held, but through water.
但随后它们“创建了国家，指定了统治者，划定了边境 ， （ 并引入了）国家制度 ” ， 但这并没有奏效。	But then they “created countries, nominated rulers, delineated frontiers, [and introduced] a state system” that would not work.
尽管它的资产翻了倍，达到3万多亿欧元（折合约4万亿美元 ） ， 欧洲已经在四年中第二次回落到衰退状态。	Despite a doubling of its balance sheet, to a little more than €3 trillion ($4 trillion), Europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years.
相反，基地组织的领导人仍固执地要在整个穆斯林世界建立极端伊斯兰统治，并不惜向一大批被认为是阻碍这一目标的国家宣战。	Al-Qaeda leaders, by contrast, remain wedded to the goal of establishing radical Islamist regimes throughout the Muslim world and waging war against a long list of governments that they see as hostile to this objective.
提高公众意识、改善卫生条件、改进监管方式等其余四诫也取得了某些进展，并大幅降低了农业抗生素的使用 — — 但这还远远不够。	There has been some progress on the remaining four Commandments – greater public awareness, improved sanitation, improved surveillance, and dramatically reduced usage of antibiotics in agriculture – but not enough.
但就目前而言，有关英国脱欧的政策 — — 无论是在英吉利海峡的哪一边 — — 都是市场友好型解决方案的绊脚石。	But, for now, the politics of Brexit – on both sides of the English Channel – are standing in the way of a market-friendly solution.
最后，法国前总统尼古拉·萨科齐（Nicolas Sarkozy）将得势，因为当今的欧元区是由一个由成员国政府首脑（极其财政部长）组成的事实上的经济政府所领导。	In the end, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has prevailed, because the eurozone today is led by a de facto economic government that comprises member countries’ heads of state and government (and their finance ministers).
看来，欧盟委员会酝酿开征金融交易税，背后就是这个想法。 欧洲的经济金融沉疴每况愈下，那便是它新开的药方。	That seems to be the thinking behind the European Commission’s proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) – the Commission’s latest response to Europe’s festering growth and financing problems.
因此，来自全世界的公共知识分子小组组成了国际公司税改革独立委员会（ICRICT ） ， 由我担任主席。	That is why a group of public intellectuals from around the world has created the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), which I chair.
我们目前这场革命始于20世纪60年代的硅谷，而且与摩尔定律密切相关：电脑芯片上的晶体管数量每两三年就会翻一番。	Our current revolution, which began in Silicon Valley in the 1960s, is bound up with Moore’s Law: the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles every couple of years.
几十年来，对于每项价值超过2亿美元的协议，卡扎菲都���自审阅，而且他往往会选择那些外国公司会接收合同的协议。	For decades, Qaddafi personally reviewed every agreement worth more than $200 million and often chose which foreign firms would receive contracts.
结果，与西欧的趋同之路有所放缓，许多国家将远远落后 — — 这一结果与2005年左右时所构想的愿景截然不同，当时，在一代人的时间里实现趋同看起来大有希望。	As a result, convergence with Western Europe could slow, with many countries lagging far behind – a far different outcome from that envisioned during the boom of the mid-2000s, when convergence within a generation seemed almost like a birthright.
就共和党人而言，他们分为传统的自由市场、自由贸易保守派和特朗普“经济民族主义者 ” ， 这些人希望限制移民和贸易，用以代替美国贸易伙伴所做出的让步。	For their part, the Republicans are divided between traditional free-market, free-trade conservatives and Trumpian “economic nationalists” who want to restrict immigration and trade in lieu of concessions by America’s trading partners.
甚至连土地和海洋的化学成分也发生着变化。 海水的酸性日益增强—进而威胁着珊瑚礁—就是二氧化碳含量增加的结果。	Even the chemistry of the land and ocean is changing, with the ocean becoming more acidic – thus threatening coral reefs – as a result of higher carbon dioxide.
意大利和法国的政治和经济弱势，以及英国的逐渐从欧盟事务中抽身凸显出德国在当前危机中捍卫欧元区的关键作用。	The political and economic weakness of France and Italy, together with Britain’s gradual withdrawal from EU affairs, highlight Germany’s key role in rescuing the eurozone from the current crisis.
如果我们只依赖双边协议，推动在困难的关键问题上达成共识的共同空间和协同将越来越窄直至消失，从气候变化到安全问题都是如此。	If we depend solely on bilateral deals, the shared spaces and synergies that facilitate agreement on difficult but vital topics – from climate change to security – will narrow until they disappear.
这一回，美联储依然是断然否认：2009年以来，如果不是QE压低了发达国家的利率，追逐收益率将不会导致新兴市场被短期“热”钱吞没。	It remains steeped in denial: Were it not for the interest-rate suppression that QE has imposed on developed countries since 2009, the search for yield would not have flooded emerging economies with short-term “hot” money.
更令人惊讶的是，哥本哈根政治家们自信地宣称，现在减排二氧化碳终将使这座城市及其居民更加富裕，化石燃料价格上涨后今天昂贵的绿色能源投资终将带来回报。	More surprisingly, Copenhagen’s politicians have confidently declared that cutting CO2 now will ultimately make the city and its citizens wealthier, with today’s expensive green-energy investments more than paying off when fossil-fuel prices rise.
去年签署的八国集团协定同意免除18个最贫困国家的债务¾这18个国家中的16个来自非洲，另外两个来自拉美。 这份协议开了个好头，但是还远远不够。	The G-8 countries’ agreement last year to a debt write-off for the 18 poorest states – 16 in Africa and two in Latin America – is a splendid, but insufficient, beginning.
而在其2027年全面实施时，它将增加大多数中间阶层美国人（位于收入分布中段的那60 % ） 的缴税额。	And, when fully implemented (in 2027), it will increase taxes on a majority of Americans in the middle (the second, third, and fourth quintiles).
但是，最近，欧洲大陆遇到了关于如何解决这一问题的意识形态僵局，环境可持续性和经济增长常常被描述为水火不容。	Lately, however, the continent has reached an ideological impasse over how to address the problem, with environmental sustainability and growth often portrayed as being mutually exclusive.
事实上，若不能在各层次同时实现高质量教育 — — 从学前教育直到大学或同等学力职业培训 — — 就实现包容增长模式就几乎无望。	Indeed, without high-quality education at all levels – from preschool through university or the equivalent professional training – it is nearly impossible to achieve inclusive growth patterns.
任何产品创新都需要一系列的创意，搞清它们对最终成果相对贡献其可能性可以说微乎其微，更不用说分清哪些是最新创意了。	The creation of any product requires many ideas, and sorting out their relative contribution to the outcome – let alone which ones are really new – can be nearly impossible.
不过，虽然聚变过程产生了一定能量（具体来讲是1，600万瓦特 ） ， 科学家们还没有成功完成能自我持续的核聚变“燃烧”过程。	But, while the fusion process has produced some power (16 million watts of it, to be specific), scientists have yet to create a self-sustaining fusion “burn.”
雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安的新当选政府那时就开始了一系列雄心勃勃的改革，以满足欧盟对其成员国的政治标准。	Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s newly elected government had embarked on a series of ambitious reforms to meet the European Union’s political criteria for membership.
"当被问及接受特奥·范霍赫采访时有何感想，欧盟执行委员鲍克斯坦说 ： "" 他直截了当是件好事；可莽撞无礼就不是了 。 """	"When asked what it was like to be interviewed by Theo van Gogh, European Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said, ""He was impertinent, and that is a good thing; he was offensive, and that is not."""
我们欧洲人可以划定我们自己的红线，警告俄罗斯，如果越线，我们将收紧对俄制裁，因为从此以后它将为其叙利亚附庸的罪行负责。	We in Europe can draw our own red line, warning Russia that, if the line is crossed, we will increase sanctions against it as a state henceforth held to be responsible for the crimes of its Syrian vassal.
一些出资人 — — 如法国、德国和欧洲投资银行 — — 正在游说经合组织发展援助委员会将无补贴贷款列为ODA，以使它们实现它们的ODA目标。	And some donors – such as France, Germany, and the European Investment Bank – are lobbying the OECD Development Assistance Committee to count unsubsidized loans as official development assistance to enable them to meet their ODA targets.
而且，在联合国气候谈判中，他们已经提出了全新的解决办法：一项名为减少因森林砍伐和森林退化而造成碳排放 （REDD+）的行动计划。	And, at UN climate talks, they have come up with a novel solution: an initiative called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
尽管北冰洋在夏天冰雪消融，但在一年中多数时候却都是冰雪覆盖，冰川融化所形成的冰山不仅越来越大，也越来越常见。	Even if the Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free in the summer, most of the year it is not, and icebergs from melting glaciers will become more common and possibly larger.
巴黎 — — 法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙将预定于2019年5月举行的欧洲议会选举认定为不光是传统右翼和左翼党派之间的斗争，还包括民粹主义者和像他自己一样的亲欧洲进步人士。	PARIS – French President Emmanuel Macron has framed the European Parliament election in May 2019 as a battle not between the traditional right and left, but between populists and pro-European progressives like himself.
一个软弱的过渡时期政府—或外来占领方的权力机构—不应该试图实施诸如国家资源私有化这样的政策，尤其在这样做可能引发政治对抗的情况下。	A weak interim national government – or a United Nations or foreign occupying administration – should not attempt to implement policies such as privatizing national resources when doing so might incite political resistance.
我们有理由去否定麦克阿斯基尔的决定，但我们同时也必须承认 — — 除非事情另有隐情 — — 他是被我们所能实践的某种最崇高的价值所感召。	We can reasonably disagree with MacAskill’s decision, but we should acknowledge that – unless there is more going on than appears on the surface – he was motivated by some of the finest values we are capable of exercising.
欧盟各国对高敏感度情报以及治安信息的交流程度堪称前所未有，并因此在确保高度法制和民主的同时提升了公共安全。	EU member states share highly sensitive intelligence and police information as never before, thereby increasing public security while upholding world-class legal and democratic standards.
但是，更有可能的是，在经历了多年的缓慢复苏后，美国经济也许终于已经准备好大步向前了，至少可以维持一段时间。	Still, it is far more likely that after years of slow recovery, the US economy might at last be ready to move significantly faster, at least for a while.
不出意料，在整个社会都承受着空前经济压力时央行竟敢公开出手援助特定金融机构，很快就令央行独立性这个概念成为了政治雷区。	Not surprisingly, the notion of independence for central banks that visibly aided specific financial institutions – and this at a time when society as a whole was under unprecedented economic stress – quickly became politically toxic.
虽然将萨科齐比做通敌卖国的马绍尔·贝当维希政权显然是有点夸张，但罗卡尔的忧虑也是许多法国人的感受 — — 而且不仅限于知识分子和权威专家。	Equating Sarkozy with Marshal Pétain’s collaborationist Vichy regime is, of course, an exaggeration, but Rocard’s concerns are shared by many French – and not only intellectuals and pundits.
因此，禁止同性恋行为的根本问题不在于国家用法律来实行某种道德观，而在于该法律是建立在认为同性恋不道德的错误观点之上。	The underlying problem with prohibiting homosexual acts, then, is not that the state is using the law to enforce private morality. It is that the law is based on the mistaken view that homosexuality is immoral.
要在不同文化的国家之间进行对比会比较困难，但是同样的结果也出现在一个国家的内部，除开那些极低收入水平的人，比如在美国年收入低于12000美元的人。	Comparisons between countries with different cultures are difficult, but the same effect appears within countries, except at very low income levels, such as below $12,000 annually for the US.
另一个重要性下降的政策领域是内部市场 — — 这是一个值得关注的决定，因为自1958年欧盟成立以来，它一直是欧洲工程的核心。	Another policy area that has lost its centrality is the internal market – a notable decision, given that it has been the centerpiece of the European project since the Commission was created in 1958.
欧盟或许已经在走下坡路，但基辅独立广场（Maidan Square）的壮观景象有力地提醒我们，欧洲的核心价值仍具有吸引力。	The shine may have come off the EU, but the gripping scenes from Kyiv’s Maidan Square are a powerful reminder of the enduring appeal of Europe’s core values.
这种方式已经在当地的非暴力抵抗运动中得以显现，同样体现这一新潮流的还有国际社会施压以色列的抵制、撤资和制裁运动（BDS ） 。	Such an approach has been exemplified in local non-violent resistance movements, as well as the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement to pressure Israel at the international level.
该机构2009年脱胎自昔日的金融稳定性论坛，基本上没有任何权力，也没有正式地位，直到最近才成为独立法律实体。	That body, which emerged from the old Financial Stability Forum in 2009 with few powers and no formal status, has only recently become a separate legal entity.
不，无论我们是否愿意承认，真正的区别是中共政府成功地将其人口中的很大一部分全球化了，远远超过印度民主政府所达到的水平。	No, the real difference – whether we like to admit it or not – is that China’s communist government has succeeded in globalizing a much larger share of its population than India’s democratic government has managed to do.
金融系统变得更为集中，导致银行问题进一步恶化 — — 它们不仅规模太大，关联和联系太紧密以致无法任由其破产，而且更加难以管理和对公众负责。	The financial system has become even more concentrated, exacerbating the problem of banks that are not only too big, too interconnected, and too correlated to fail, but that are also too big to manage and be held accountable.
风险已经改变 — — 并且已经从银行系统转移出去 — — 因此监管者和监督者必须采取行动，将注意力扩大到银行之外。	Because risks have morphed – and migrated out of the banking system – regulators and supervisors will have to step up their efforts and widen their focus to see beyond the banks.
在“经济和就业”类的前十大观点中有三个与增加大银行约束有关 — — 而对于“拆分花旗集团 ” （ Break Up Citigroup）的支持更是急剧增加（充分披露：该主题由我建议该网站列出 ） 。	Three of the top ten ideas under “Economy & Jobs” are about imposing greater constraints on the big banks – and there is a sharp upward trend in support for Break Up Citigroup (full disclosure: I suggested this item for the website).
它们似乎想要先把私人部门吓怕，这样一来，在财政大斧头真正砍下来的时候，消费者和投资者才会相信大难已经避免，从而增加支出。	It as if they are trying to terrorize the private sector, so that when the fiscal ax actually falls, consumers and investors will be sufficiently relieved that disaster has been averted that they will increase spending.
无论如何，美国应该强力领导世界的前提建立在这样的观点上：没有仁慈的超级霸权充当世界警察，世界就会陷入混乱，就会有邪恶势力主宰世界。	Either way, the premise that the US should lead forcefully rests on the idea that without a benevolent hegemonic power to police the world, chaos will ensue and more malevolent forces will take over.
萨普的回答可能不是最聪明的，但是如果评委对印度人是多么渴望在体育上取得成功有任何的了解的话，他们就会明白她不是在表达一个很荒谬的要务。	Sapre’s answer might not have been the brightest, but if the judges had any idea of how desperate Indians are for sporting success, they would have understood that she was not expressing such an absurd priority.
当前，有人将危机和日本20世纪90年代的经历进行对比 — — 这是日本“失去的十年 ” ， 在经济方面它也削弱了日本执政的自民党的正当性。	Currently, parallels are being drawn to Japan’s experience in the 1990’s – a “lost decade” in economic terms that also undermined the legitimacy of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
就目前而言，奥巴马依然深陷在美国国内卫生法案的政治斗争当中难以自拔，而且也难以及时地为即将给京都议定书制定后续协议的哥本哈根峰会做点什么。	Obama is still fighting back home for his healthcare initiative, and is hamstrung from acting on climate change in time for the Copenhagen summit, which is to agree on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol.
自2012年成立Rappler以来，路易萨的网站已经公开了与杜特尔特总统“禁毒战”法外处决信息有关的大量宝贵资料。	Since founding Rappler in 2012, Ressa’s website has become an invaluable source of information about the extrajudicial killings linked to President Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs.”
宏观经济行为的结构主义视角引出了一个被称为“自然”失业率的概念。 这个概念借用两次世界大战期间在欧洲出现的“自然”利率的概念。	The structuralist perspective on macroeconomic behavior led to the concept that came to be called the “natural” rate of unemployment, borrowing from the notion, which arose in Europe during the interwar years, of a “natural” interest rate.
有几个国家已经开始推行强调预防和治疗而非打击的政策 — — 并将重点放到真正的敌人身上，那就是有组织犯罪。	Several countries are pursuing policies that emphasize prevention and treatment rather than repression – and refocusing their repressive measures on fighting the real enemy: organized crime.
事实上，这场尤先科和特莫申科领导的和平革命提醒了我们基辅在被迫让路给专制的莫斯科之前文明发展到多么高的程度。	Indeed, that peaceful revolution, led by Viktor Yushchenko and Yuliya Tymoshenko, was a reminder of how enlightened Kievan Rus had been before it was forced to give way to the despotic princes of Moscow.
在蒂勒森漫长的国际交易经验中 — — 这和外交并不是一回事 — — 他与俄罗斯总统普京建立了紧密的关系，而特朗普对普京的太对相当“软 ” 。	In his extensive international deal-making – which isn’t the same as diplomacy – Tillerson has developed a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, toward whom Trump has been notably soft.
这一新管道包围乌克兰、波兰当然还有波罗地海三国，将会为俄罗斯在寻求地区影响力的过程中提供更大的手段。	By circumventing Ukraine, Poland, and of course, the Baltic countries, the new pipeline promises greater leverage to the Kremlin as it seeks to reassert itself regionally.
当中国的高速工业发展提升了对德国传统出口需求的同时，欧元也为德国在欧洲南部地区创造了极为蓬勃的外部需求。	Until recently, the euro also provided booming external demand in southern Europe, while China’s breakneck industrial development raised demand for Germany’s traditional exports.
从工业革命到现在，西方的发展一直没有受到任何环境方面的约束，因此新兴国家认为，调整成本不应该由它们来承担。	From the Industrial Revolution until very recently, the West’s development was free of any environmental restrictions, and the emerging countries believe that they should not have to bear the adjustment cost.
2008年，美联储与十个发达经济体的中央银行建立了货币互换机制，其中包括欧元区，英国，日本，瑞士，和四个新兴经济体（巴西，韩国，墨西哥，新加坡 ） 。	In 2008, the Fed established currency-swap lines with the central banks of ten developed economies, including the eurozone, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland, and four emerging economies (Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, and Singapore).
同样令人恐怖的是，最严重的迫害对准了耶西迪人（Yedizi，与库尔德人一起生活的古老宗教群体 ） 。	As terrible as all of this is, the worst of the persecution has been aimed at the Yezidi, an ancient religious group that lives among the Kurds.
理查德·尼克松就是一个最好的例子，虽然他从来没有表达过对犹太人的好感，但不用质疑，在他的执政时期，以色列仍然是白宫最坚定的盟友。	That was clearly the case with Richard Nixon, who never suffered from an excess of love for Jews, but was nonetheless one of the staunchest allies that Israel ever had in the White House.
世界反兴奋剂机构（WADA）早在2003年就禁止使用基因兴奋剂，但有些科学家仍然认为，滥用基因兴奋剂的情况很可能会在2008年北京奥运会中出现。	The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibited gene doping in 2003, but some scientists predict that its misuse in sport is likely to appear at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.
意大利和西班牙政府指出，它们的高借贷成本基本上是兑换风险的反映，欧洲央行应该采取一切必要手段纠正这一问题。	The Italian and Spanish governments argue that their high borrowing costs largely reflect convertibility risks, and that the ECB should do as much as necessary to address them.
事实上，中国经济的真实状况早已无法摸透，但因目前更严厉的监管而暴露出来 — — 比如将人民币的投机交易粉饰成贸易支付。	In fact, the Chinese economy’s true condition had long been obscured, but has now been exposed by more stringent regulation of activities such as speculative trading of the renminbi masquerading as trade payments.
该国经济实际是权贵资本主义的一个变种，经济成功并非来自于孕育了自由的自由市场竞争，而是取决于谁在政界有“关系 ” 。	Its economy is a variant of crony capitalism, in which economic success depends on one’s political connections, rather than on the meritocratic free-market competition from which liberty grows.
发自纽黑文 — — 最近出现的全球经济走弱迹象令许多人开始思考未来几年的恶劣经济表现究竟会蔓延到何种地步。	NEW HAVEN – Recent indications of a weakening global economy have led many people to wonder how pervasive poor economic performance will be in the coming years.
法国评论员赫尔·加文（Hervé Juvin）在他2005年的黑马作品《身体的起源》中赞扬了这种新态度。	The French commentator Hervé Juvin extolled this new attitude towards the body in his 2005 surprise bestseller, L’avènement du corps (The Coming of the Body) .
而这类结构性变革有时会同时具备得益和破坏的双重属性，对此政策制定者们一直以来都奋力想在抽象的开放原则和具体措施之间找寻平衡，以避免变革所导致的最恶劣影响。	Structural change can be simultaneously beneficial and disruptive. And policymakers have long had to strike a balance between the abstract principle of openness and concrete measures to limit the worst effects of change.
这一在2005年联合国大会一致通过的原则在其他地区都能良好地贯彻，包括支持2008年对肯尼亚的外交干预。	That principle, unanimously agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2005, has been successfully invoked elsewhere, including in support of diplomatic intervention in Kenya in 2008.
这在推高了美元价值的同时也长期削弱了美国的出口竞争力，正如伦敦金融城提供的金融产品在对其欧盟成员国资格毫无异议的年代里推高了英镑，打击了英国出口那样。	This has driven up the dollar’s value and chronically undermined export competitiveness, much like the financial products offered by the City of London did in the UK by fueling sterling appreciation in the years of undisputed EU membership.
说服大国销毁核武器或许看上去就像让美国国会通过枪支管制法一样在政治上想入非非，但在这个问题上，奥巴马已经明确表示自己愿意尝试。	Convincing great powers to eliminate their nuclear arsenals might seem as politically fanciful as pushing gun-control legislation through the US Congress, but on that issue, too, Obama has made clear that he is willing to try.
如果一项政策能大大提振国内经济，给外国带来的负面溢出效应只是暂时的，那么也应该获得绿灯（这项政策对外国经济也是有益的，因为最终本国经济的进口需求将得到提振 ） 。	A policy could also be green if it jump-starts the home economy with only temporary negative spillovers for the foreign economy (the policy will still be good for the foreign economy by eventually boosting the home economy’s demand for imports).
索马里兰可以算做盟友之一，这个国家以前曾是英国的保护国，1991年从索马里独立，位于埃塞俄比亚的东北部。	One such ally could be Somaliland, the former British protectorate, which broke away from Somalia in 1991 and lies to the northeast of Ethiopia.
香港 — — 世界领导人将于本周末的法国戛纳G20峰会上聚首，而他们将面临的下一个经济雷区已经浮现在了眼前。	HONG KONG – With world leaders meeting at the end of this week at the G-20 summit in Cannes, France, the next economic minefield that they will face is already coming into view.
比如，埃及新旧军事统治者认定，美国的批评可以忽略，因为出于地缘政治原因，美国不可能取消对埃及的援助。	Egypt’s old-new military rulers, for example, have concluded that American criticism can be ignored, because America cannot cut off its aid to Egypt for geopolitical reasons.
但在长期，它可能减少美国就业，缩小北美占全球市场的比例，并破坏美国在国际贸易问题上的信誉 — — 与此同时也无法降低美国经常项目赤字。	But in the long run, it will likely reduce US employment, shrink North America’s share of the global auto market, and undermine America’s credibility on international trade issues – all while failing to reduce the US current-account deficit.
从更广的角度，尽管我的祖国身处千钧一发之势，但乌克兰应该获得清晰的路线图走出当前的安全“灰色地带 ” ， 走向欧洲-大西洋未来。	"More broadly, despite the highly charged situation in our country, Ukraine deserves a clear road map out of its current security “grey zone"" and toward a Euro-Atlantic future."
我知道民主的辉煌时代曾被践踏，1956年在布达佩斯，1968年在布拉格，以及1989年在天安门广场。	I know that stirrings of democracy have been crushed before: in Budapest in 1956, Prague in 1968, and in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
小学和中学的努力有助于在女生中培养更多样化的兴趣，让有才华的年轻女性获得她们所需要的工具，在关键经济部门做出重要贡献。	Efforts by primary and secondary schools could help to foster more diverse interests among female students, giving talented young women the tools they need to make important contributions to key economic sectors.
要说谁懂得行胜于言的道理，那一定是普京 — — 他经常断然否认证据确凿的坏事，比如干预美国选举和违反条约。	If anyone knows that actions speak louder than words, it is Putin, whose words often include transparent denials of documented wrongdoing, from meddling in the US election to violating treaties.
但是，为了赢得美国的重视，欧盟需要拿出设计完善而且资源配置合理的方案，而不是随随便便地提出27条不成熟的想法。	But, in order to be taken seriously by the US, the EU needs to bring well-developed, well-resourced policies to the table, rather than 27 half-baked ideas.
在侍从军官行刺企图失败后，达迪斯·卡马拉逃往国外，接替他的临时军政府领袖赛古巴·科纳特将军允许反对党任命一位平民总理。	Following an assassination attempt by an aide-de-camp, Dadis Camara fled the country, and the interim junta leader, General Sékouba Konaté, allowed the opposition political parties to appoint a civilian prime minister.
回顾他的一生，阿拉法特从未真正改变过自己的信仰：那就是把不惜一切手段毁灭以色列，代之以巴勒斯坦阿拉伯国家当作自己的终身目标。	Looking back at his career, Arafat never really veered from the belief that his life's mission was to destroy Israel by any means necessary and replace it with a Palestinian Arab state.
鉴于会议内容往往要临场确定，要确保有限度营销确实存在一定难度；发言人可能会出人意料地利用讲台宣传某种产品，这么做可能导致他/她被从今后的邀请名单上排除。	Given that the content is being created in real time, this can be challenging; a speaker may unexpectedly use the stage to promote a product, in which case he or she would probably not be invited back.
更世俗的真理是，昔日维持伊斯兰世界和平的是奥斯曼、不列颠和法兰西帝国，在它们分崩离析后，一直没有稳定的继任者产生。	The more mundane truth is that there have never been any stable successors to the defunct Ottoman, British, and French empires that used to keep the peace in the Islamic world.
En outre, même si la Commission européenne a clairement le devoir de d’empêcher la mauvaise gestion et la fraude, il se trouve que chaque demande de financement de l’UE demande des procédures extrêmement onéreuses.	Moreover, although the European Commission clearly has a duty to prevent mismanagement and fraud, every application for EU funding requires extremely onerous procedures.
如果说斯大林的道德记录有什么“模糊不清”的地方，可能是共产主义于我们的崇高目标 — — 人人平等、终结贫穷 — — 有共鸣之处。	If there is any “ambiguity” about Stalin’s moral record, it may be because communism strikes a chord with some of our nobler impulses, seeking equality for all and an end to poverty.
然而，即使许多公正和发展党的激进分子和选民都是虔诚的穆斯林，埃尔多安和居尔仍然致力于加入欧洲的一体化。	Yet, even if many AKP activists and voters are devout Muslims, Erdogan and Gul remain committed to European integration.
随着全球经济增长回暖以及某些地缘政治不确定性的出现（可能会限制一些产油国的产量 ） ， 目前油价已回升至每桶60美元以上。	With the pickup in global growth and the emergence of geopolitical uncertainties (which could constrain output in some oil-producing countries), oil prices have rebounded to above $60 per barrel.
该办法既更加累进，也更加有效：资本是高度流动的，因此从公民个人和股东居民头上征税要比从跨国公司头上征税容易得多。	It is both more progressive and more effective: with highly mobile capital, it is far easier to collect taxes from individual citizens and resident shareholders than from multinational companies.
在法国和阿拉伯国家关系方面，可以肯定地说，奥朗德同意奥巴马2009年开罗演讲的提倡包容（pro-engagement）的观点。	With regard to relations between France and the Arab world, one can be certain that Hollande would agree with the pro-engagement thrust of Obama’s 2009 Cairo speech.
我们应该停止愚蠢的害怕，停止追寻愚蠢的政策并且开始投资于长远的、聪明的研发项目。 “反人类罪”的指责必须停止。	We have to stop being scared silly, stop pursuing stupid policies, and start investing in smart long-term R&D. Accusations of “crimes against humanity” must cease.
如果观察员能体会言外之意并大量观察那些没有按照本来面目表述的东西，下任美国总统外交策的观点可以看清楚了。	Aspects of the next president’s foreign policy are there to see if observers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is.
这一可能性大小是一个连续变量，从比如O（可恶的压迫性独裁统治）直到W（管理良好、功能完善的民主 ） 。	The scale would be continuous, going from, say, O (odious repressive dictatorships) to W (well-managed and fully functioning democracies).
约旦与以色列签署的和平条约的第三和第八条款明确将难民问题作为一个主要的亟需解决的问题，同时还引证了越国界管理和耶路撒冷未解决的状况。	Articles 3 and 8 of Jordan’s peace treaty with Israel refer explicitly to the refugee problem as one of the major issues still to be resolved, as well as citing the unresolved status of trans-border arrangements and of Jerusalem.
爱尔兰在成为欧盟成员国的35年内几乎享受了不成比例的好处，到了2008年时还从欧盟预算中净赚了5亿欧元。	Ireland has benefited disproportionately from EU largesse during its 35 years of membership, and, in 2008, was still receiving a net sum of €500 million from the EU budget.
长期以来，沙特阿拉伯通过向臣民发放巨额石油财富，以及在沙特社会推行基于严格的瓦哈比派传统的原教旨伊斯兰教保持（相对）内部稳定。	Saudi Arabia has long maintained (relative) internal stability by spreading its enormous oil wealth among its subjects, and by imposing on Saudi society fundamentalist Islamic doctrines based on the austere Wahhabi tradition.
伊丽莎白女王二世有过著名的一问：经济学家为何不能预见灾难？ 她或许要求太高了些，但一个众人皆有的感觉是经济学家的研究有很多属于“无厘头 ” 。	Queen Elizabeth II may have expected too much when she famously asked why economists had failed to foresee the disaster, but there is a widespread sense that much of their research turned out to be irrelevant.
库普乾认为，外交才是战略融合和互信的基本要素，而具有相似社会秩序和民族成分的国家间更容易建立和谐的外交关系。	Rather, he regards diplomatic engagement as the essential element to strategic accommodation and mutual trust, and this is more easily accomplished if the states have similar social orders and ethnicities.
如果欧洲领导人认真对待COP21承诺，就应该在2030年在2010年消费水平的基础上减少70 % ， 这一目标比欧洲理事会2014年的目标宏大一倍。	If European leaders are serious about their COP21 commitment, they should embrace a 70% reduction on 2010 consumption levels by 2030 – more than double the European Council’s 2014 target.
分离主义分子重提18世纪英国的暴行，并称苏格兰可以借此保有全部的北海石油储量，并且不再分担英国的债务。	The secessionists hark back to eighteenth-century English brutality and claim that Scotland will be able to keep all of its North Sea oil and shed its share of the UK’s debt.
这导致那些赤字国家只能通过通货紧缩的方式来调整实际汇率 — — 但这会引发公共和私人负债持续上升，最终导致大规模的信用违约	This is forcing deficit countries into real exchange-rate adjustments via deflation – and thus a rising burden of public and private debt that may lead to disorderly defaults.
举例来讲，二十世纪七十年代秘鲁批准安第斯山脉民众有权使用驼羊毛挽救了濒于灭绝的驼羊并为当地民众创造了长期的新的收入流。	For example, in the 1970s when Peru granted Andean communities the right to use vicuña wool, it saved the vicuña from extinction and created new, long-term income streams for the community.
真正的原因在于新闻审查制度，这场爆炸其实正代表了亚美尼亚匿影藏形的反新闻界集团对新闻界发起的最新攻击。	But the real problem is censorship, for the explosion was but the latest offensive in Armenia’s hidden war against the press.
因为全球教育合作机构的资助，从2002到2014年间发展中国家接受小学教育的女童增加了3，800万人。	Thanks to GPE funding, an additional 38 million girls in developing countries were enrolled in primary school from 2002 to 2014.
如果风险资本家蒂姆·德拉珀（Tim Draper）将加利福尼亚分成六个州的错误计划成功，硅谷将是美国最富有的州，而中央山谷将是最贫穷的州。	If the venture capitalist Tim Draper had succeeded in his misguided initiative to divide California into six states, Silicon Valley would have become the richest state in the US, and the Central Valley the poorest.
诚然，特朗普和其他民粹主义者经常试图通过声称集会中有“危机演员”或“付费积极分子”来诋毁真正的抗议活动。	True, Trump and other populists often try to discredit bona fide protests by claiming that they are stocked with “crisis actors” or “paid activists.”
主角一步步向地下贩毒网堕落的过程被描写得极为详尽，在此过程中，他所作出的每一个决定几乎都是十分理性的。	The main protagonist’s step-by-step descent into the drug underworld unfolds with such subtlety that each individual decision he makes along the way seems almost reasonable.
最后，药物进入市场，也必须对其进行严格跟踪，因为许多不良反应要经过众多病人多年的使用之后才能被发现。	Finally, the drug reaches the market, where it must be followed closely, because many adverse reactions are detected only with a large number of patients and after years of use.
逆转这一趋势在银行联盟的三大关键要素���—共同监管者、共同存款保险和共同清算基金 — — 都切实具备之前是不可能的。	Reversal of that process will likely not occur until the three key elements of banking union – common supervision, common deposit insurance, and a common resolution fund – are within tangible reach.
中国对日本处于美国保护之下的状态相对感到满意，因为它担心另一种情况：一个扩展其独立军事影响力的日本。	It is relatively content with Japan being a US security protectorate, because it fears the alternative: a Japan that expands its independent military reach.
同样可能被视为作弊的还有要求以技术转让换取市场准入、偏向于国内实体的公共采购、接受不安全的工作环境及剥削性的劳动行为，还有汇率操纵。	So may requiring technology transfer in exchange for market access, public procurement favoring domestic entities, acceptance of unsafe work environments and exploitative labor practices, and exchange-rate manipulation.
最近围绕世界银行行长Paul Wolfowitz辞职的纷扰凸现了推进世行良好治理和反腐败议程的必要性。	The recent turbulence surrounding the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz from the Presidency of the World Bank has underscored the need to push ahead with the Bank’s good governance and anti-corruption agenda.
一般认为俄乌两国之所以不愿做为，是因为两国政府都将注射吸毒者视为罪犯而非需要救治的病人，因此宁愿让这些人自生自灭。	The popular explanation for lack of action in Russia and Ukraine is that their governments view IDUs as criminals, rather than people with a disease, and adopt an informal let-them-rot policy.
我们还可以认为这些措施会在2013年1月结束，届时将会有新动作，抛出新措施的既可能是连任的奥巴马，也可能是新的共和党总统。	And we can assume that it would be repealed and replaced by something else come January 2013, either by a re-elected President Barack Obama, or by a new, Republican president.
事实上，两项著名的纵向研究 — — 马萨诸塞州的弗莱明汉姆心脏研究（Framingham Heart Study）和瑞典的国王岛项目（Kungsholmen Project）在阿尔茨海默症的预测方面获得了重要进展。	In fact, two famous longitudinal studies – the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts and the Kungsholmen Project in Sweden – have led to important progress in predicting the disease.
今天，将俄国和中国联系在一起的已经不仅仅是两国的能源协议，这两个国家都认定，属于他们的时代已经到来。 世界需要他们更甚于他们需要世界，而美国尤其如此。	Russia and China today are united not only by their energy deals, but also by both countries’ conviction that their time has come, and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world, particularly the US.
尽管报告对国际合作这一方向持首肯态度，但它违反了国际共识，增加了不可逆转的基因改变风险和新的不平等形式。	Although the report nods in the direction of international cooperation, it breaches an international consensus in a way that increases the risks of irreversible genetic alterations and new forms of inequality.
巴方已经满足了以方以及国际社会提出的所有安全要求，而在两国方案上言而无信的内塔尼亚胡政府却依然不愿划定本方边界。	Palestinians complied with all Israeli and international requirements for security, while Binyamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government, which gives lip-service to the two-state solution, has yet to elucidate where Israel’s borders will be.
去年12月，公诉人指控萨哈罗夫博物馆的两名官员和三名展览组织者煽动宗教仇恨，他们面临长达5年的牢狱生涯。	Last December, prosecutors charged two Sakharov Museum officials and three of the exhibition's organizers with inciting religious hatred. They now face prison terms of up to five years.
在美国和许多欧洲国家，平均工资停滞不前，尽管从GDP和就业增长角度看，大部分经济体已经从2008年金融危机中复苏。	In the United States and many European countries, average salaries have stagnated, despite most economies having recovered from the 2008 financial crisis in terms of GDP and job growth.
过去10年来肺结核发病数的年下降率仅有1.65 % ； 而2014年一年，肺结核就夺去了150万人的生命。	The annual decline in cases over the past decade has been a mere 1.65%; in 2014, TB killed 1.5 million people.
所有非洲开发银行支持的废水管理系统都遵循可持续发展原则，以确保能提高经济收益、惠及当地社会并让当地民众负担得起相应的费用。	All AfDB-supported wastewater-management systems follow sustainability strategies to ensure that they enhance economic gains, benefit local communities, and remain affordable.
印度人民党假装这是一次中立行动，哪怕在因甄别“外国人”而额首相庆的同时，仍然强调整个过程都接受最高法院的监督。	The BJP pretends that this is a neutral exercise, emphasizing that the Supreme Court supervised the process, even as it celebrates the identification of “foreigners.”
斯堪的纳维亚人早就想通了这一点：它是维持一个开放社会 — — 全球化和技术变革开放 — — 的社会契约的一部分。	The Scandinavians figured this out long ago; it was part of the social contract that maintained an open society – open to globalization and changes in technology.
堪培拉 — — 当美国总统唐纳德·特朗普突然取消与朝鲜领导人金正恩的首脑会晤，他将原因归咎于朝鲜的公开敌意和巨大愤怒。	CANBERRA – When US President Donald Trump abruptly canceled his summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, he blamed “tremendous anger and open hostility” from the North.
最后，该赌注认为石油出口国 — — 如尼日利亚、委内瑞拉，特别还有俄罗斯 — — 将成功避免经济崩溃，即使全球油价暴跌。	Finally, the bet assumes that oil-exporting countries like Nigeria, Venezuela, and especially Russia will fend off economic implosion, even as global oil prices plummet.
即使是在言论自由受到严格保护的美国，此类煽动性言论也会遭到起诉和严惩，只要它与暴力和其他非法行为扯上关系。	Even in the US, where freedom of expression is zealously protected, such incitement may be prosecuted and punished in circumstances in which violence or other unlawful behavior is imminent.
如今，像伊斯兰国和尼日利亚博科圣地这样的组织已经加入了基地组织的队伍，诱惑世界各地的穆斯林民众，从而确保对全球圣战运动的领导。	Today, groups like the Islamic State and Nigeria’s Boko Haram have joined Al Qaeda in a struggle to attract Muslims from all over the world, thereby securing their leadership in global jihad.
事实上，福岛第一核电站防护海塘遇袭之后几小时甚至几天内所发生的事情尽管令人震惊，却称得上是核电安全性的一次有力证明。	In fact, although what happened was shocking, the events in the hours and days after a giant wave slammed over the nuclear plant’s protective seawall might be interpreted as a remarkable testament to nuclear power’s sound credentials.
雅典 — — “希腊有史以来代价最昂贵的局部政府改组 ” ， 这至少是形容9月20日希腊大选结果的一种方式。	ATHENS – “The costliest minor government reshuffle in Greece’s history.” That is at least one way to describe the result of the Greek general election on September 20.
但没有伊朗的联盟实际已成为逊尼派阵线，伊朗本应参与谈判并在平息叙利亚内战中发挥更显著的作用。 但这一切的前提是伊朗愿意签署协议控制其核计划。	Iran, without which the coalition essentially becomes a Sunni front, can have a place at the table – and play a large and overt role in resolving the Syrian civil war – but only if it is willing to reach a deal to rein in its nuclear program.
多数历史学家都认为恐怖的伊凡名副其实；他不仅杀害了他的儿子和其他亲属，还下令执行1565到1572年令俄国陷入恐怖氛围的由国家主导的清洗运动（oprichnina ） 。	Most historians agree that Ivan lived up to his name; not only did he kill his son and other relatives, he also ordered the oprichnina, the state-led purges that terrorized Russia from 1565 to 1572.
现在去岛上希腊塞浦路斯聚居地参观的人不会再看到难民营：成百上千万的游客多数都不会想到，他们碰到超过三分之一的希腊塞浦路斯人或者是难民、或者是难民的后裔。	Anyone visiting the Greek Cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps: most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the Greek Cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees.
发展中国家目前面临更高的通胀率并非是因为宏观管理不善，而是由于石油和食品价格在窜升。 与富国相比，这些项目在平均家庭预算中占据更大的比例。	Developing countries currently face higher rates of inflation not because of poorer macro-management, but because oil and food prices are soaring, and these items represent a much larger share of the average household budget than in rich countries.
这一在人类帮助下发生的新演化意味着在人类世，我们其实既是旧生物多样性的毁灭者，也是新生物多样性的创造者。	This evolution of new human-associated species means that, in the Anthropocene, we are effectively creators of new biological diversity as well as destroyers of the old.
但如今运用到现代经济领域，这样的赞美在现实中至少是尴尬的：现代经济靠几家央行堆积如山的巨额债务来稳定金融系统。	But, applied to the modern economy, such praise is awkward at best, because it is literally true: the financial system was stabilized by piling huge volumes of debt into a few central banks.
但是我们目前面临的大规模的经常项目不平衡带来的风险之一就是政客可能会指责别的国家，采取保护主义政策。	But one of the risks associated with the large current-account imbalances we now face is that politicians may decide to blame one or another country and espouse protectionist policies.
举例来说，斯堪的那维亚国家、地中海国家以及像爱尔兰和英国那样的“自由的大西洋国家”之间的差别在某些时候要比欧洲整体和美国之间的差别还要大。	The differences for instance between the Scandinavian countries, the Mediterranean countries, and the “liberal Atlantic countries” like Ireland and the UK are sometimes more pronounced than those between Europe as a whole and the US.
正如接受治疗的大鼠的行为不再那么拘谨（更加能够忍受明亮开放的空间 ） ， 接受治疗的焦虑患者也更有可能能够回到工作岗位中。	Just as medicated rats are less behaviorally inhibited (more able to tolerate bright, open spaces), medicated anxiety sufferers are more likely to be able to return to their jobs.
这一模式或许也可以用于政治关系：赫希曼曾写过一篇著名文章，证明了在1989年退出东德的可行性是如何导致忠诚突然崩溃的。	The schema might also be applied to political relations: Hirschman wrote a memorable article showing how the ability to exit East Germany in 1989 produced a sudden breakdown of loyalty.
不论在国内还是国外，分离（disconnect）的现象严重，这给“中国因素”对脆弱世界的影响增加了新的风险维度。	On both counts, the disconnects are striking, adding a new dimension of risk to the impact of the “China factor” on a fragile world.
事实上，在特朗普取胜造成的重大不确定性下，构建新型关系比以往任何时候更具有战略价值，因为全球环境不断变化，而且美中两国都面临着区域地缘政治和国内挑战。	Indeed, amid the vast uncertainty created by Trump’s victory, a new relationship now makes more strategic sense than ever, given changing global circumstances, regional geopolitics, and domestic challenges in both the US and China.
众所周知的、低成本以及低科技含量的防治手段，例如破伤风疫苗、专门母乳、低体重婴儿的简单护理以及防止传染的抗生素等并没有提供给那些最需要得到的孩子。	Well known, low-cost, and low-tech interventions do not reach those most in need – for example immunization against tetanus, exclusive breastfeeding, simple care for low-weight babies, and antibiotics for infection.
尽管如此，即使是迅速实现“更加绿色”的能源转变，也不足以让全球平均气温限定在前工业化水平以上2℃以内。	Still, not even a rapid shift toward “greener” energy will be enough to keep global average temperature within 2º of preindustrial levels.
虽然贾迈勒在埃及掌权已经没有太多障碍，但在阿尔及利亚，将赛义德扶上宝座的努力可能会在强大政权利益的抵制下付诸东流。	While few obstacles remain in Gamal’s path to power in Egypt, in Algeria, meanwhile, a bid to install Said would likely collapse against resistance from powerful regime interests.
可能还有其他办法能够解决问题：那就是像许多市场经济国家那样收紧专利法或对制药等垄断行业实行价格管制。	Other approaches are also possible: tightening up patent laws or imposing price controls for monopolistic industries, such as pharmaceuticals, as many market economies have done.
柏林—据5月初ARD德国趋势（DeutschlandTREND）的民意调查，极右翼的德国另类道路党（Alternative for Germany，AfD）的民众支持率为15 % ， 而一年前只有5 % 。	BERLIN – According to an early May opinion poll by ARD DeutschlandTREND, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party’s popular support now stands at 15%, up from around 5% a year ago.
默克尔有两个选择：她可以右倾，如法国前总统萨科齐为法国总统大选所做的最后一搏那样；她也可以硬碰AfD的简单化立场，坚持中间道路。	Merkel has two choices: She can move to the right, as former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has done in his latest bid for the French presidency, or she can fight to hold the center by addressing the AfD’s simplistic arguments head on.
但另一个有害的传说是“欧洲堡垒”正在遭受一波又一波野蛮人的冲击。 这一传说通过令人震惊的影像传播 — — 大量难民蜂拥通过边境隔离带，或者试图攀上加莱（Calais）的火车 — — 它存在两个层面的错误。	Yet another damaging myth, perpetuated by shocking images of refugees swarming through border fences or attempting to climb onto trains in Calais, is that “Fortress Europe” is under assault by waves of barbarians.
在2016年核安全峰会召开之前，我们最需要的是有一套程序促进全面解决核威胁的全球行动，确保全面禁止核试验条约生效就是其中之一。	What is most needed in the run-up to the 2016 NSS is a process that advances global action to address the nuclear threat comprehensively, including by ensuring that the CTBT enters into force.
那么，IMF给出了“资本流自由化的综合性方针 ” ， 并具体给出了改革的详细步骤，既然如此，关于资本管制和如何使其更有效也不具有什么可比性了。	So, while the Fund lays out an “integrated approach to capital flow liberalization,” and specifies a detailed sequence of reforms, there is nothing remotely comparable on capital controls and how to render them more effective.
NDPO的修改草案似乎认识到这一点，同时强调日本自卫、日美联盟的合作、以及对多边使命做出贡献的必要性。	The draft revision of the NDPO seems to recognize this, emphasizing the need for Japan’s own defense efforts, cooperation through the Japanese-US alliance, and contributions to multilateral missions.
俄罗斯目前向中国销售某些武器，但却避免向其出口最尖端的系统。 因为克里姆林宫将中国看作未来潜在的威胁。	Russia currently sells certain arms to China, but avoids exporting its most sophisticated systems, since the Kremlin views China as a potential future threat.
日益开放的金融市场让外国银行和资产管理者能够迅速甩卖债务 — — 通常是出于与经济基本面无关的理由。	Increasingly open financial markets allow foreign banks and asset managers to dump debts rapidly, often for reasons that have little to do with economic fundamentals.
与此相反，中国的腐败通常都是“利益分享”型，那些国有企业高管的家庭成员都拥有股份，他们的收益随着企业盈利的上升而增加 — — 这是某种促进经济增长的腐败。	By contrast, in China, the corruption has largely been of the “profit-sharing” variety, whereby family members are given a stake in the enterprise so that their earnings increase as profits increase – a type of corruption that promotes growth.
朝鲜领袖金正恩绝非中国邓小平式的改革分子；但因为市场不可逆转的扩张力量，他的政权正日复一日变得与中国越来越相似。	North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is no reformist like China’s Deng Xiaoping; but his regime is becoming more like China’s every day, owing to the irreversible expansion of market forces.
民主党的这项承诺本应是日本新独立自主战略的一部分，只要踏出了第一步，日本就不会再像某位自民党前首相所说的那样，仅仅是美国的一艘“航空母舰 ” 。	This promise by the DPJ was meant to be part of Japan’s new assertiveness, a first step away from being a mere “aircraft carrier” for the US, as a former LDP prime minister once described his country.
美国会愿意向印度出售进攻性武器 — — 包括高精确度常规武器、反潜系统和长程空基和地基巡航导弹 — — 以有助于威慑中国的军事先发制人吗？	Would the US be willing to sell India offensive weapons – including high-precision conventional arms, anti-submarine systems, and long-range air- and sea-launched cruise missiles – that could help to deter Chinese military preemption?
从这一技术官僚观点来看，今天的布鲁塞尔维持了某些功能，而即使在某些民族国家内部，这些功能都经常被分派到不是民主选举产生的机构中。	From this technocratic perspective, Brussels today maintains functions that even within nation states are often delegated to institutions that are not democratically elected.
库尔德人民民主党（Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party，HDP）在最近的大选中大获成功，获得13%选票 — — 远多于该党核心选区的选票比例 — — 这必然会增强库尔德人的信心，有利于和平进程。	The success of the mainly Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) in capturing 13% of the vote in the recent election – a total well above the party’s core constituency – should boost the Kurds’ confidence and ease the way ahead in the peace process.
西方自由民主国家应该如何面对一个按照自己的战略计划行动、利用它们的开放性推动它的意识形态和地缘政治目标的中国？	How should Western liberal democracies confront a China that is taking a page from their own playbook, as it exploits their openness to advance its ideological and geopolitical objectives?
但尽管当局在1999年他们上一次面临严重不良贷款问题用过这招，货币印刷机却无法与官员的另一既定目标相兼容：稳定的汇率。	But, while the authorities relied on this approach in 1999, the last time they were faced with a serious bad-loan problem, running the money printing press is not compatible with officials’ other stated goal: a stable exchange rate.
埃尔多安说他想“让阿夫林回到真正的所有者手中 ” ， 从而让350万土耳其境内叙利亚难民“尽快回到自己的土地上 ” 。	Erdoğan has claimed that he wants “to deliver Afrin to its real owners,” thereby enabling the more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey to return “to their own land as soon as possible.”
如此一来，中、东欧各国的选民们现在觉得政府让他们做了亏本生意也在情理之中：勒紧裤带、劳务市场限制和欧盟规章的狂轰滥炸。	Little wonder, then, that voters in Central and Eastern Europe now feel that they got a poor bargain from the governments that brought them in: belt tightening, labor market restrictions, and the notorious barrage of EU regulation.
鉴于人类有限的阅读速度（每分钟200-300字）和现有的巨大的信息量，当今有效的决策在知识精密化的每一个方面都需要语义技术。	Given humans’ limited reading speed (200-300 words per minute) and the enormous volume of available information, effective decision-making today calls for semantic technology in every aspect of knowledge refinement.
取得险胜的执政者上台后奉行极端主义政策也会造成类似的后果。 有人说乔治·W·布什在美国已经贯彻了这样的做法，很多人害怕奥夫拉多尔（Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador）会领导墨西哥追随布什的后尘。	The same may also be true if narrow winners adopt a radical agenda, as some think George W. Bush has done in America and many feared Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador would do in Mexico.
但他们同时引入了目的完全相反的记忆法：通过将历史暴行的责任完全推给他人 — — 无论是希特勒的德国还是斯大林的苏联 — — 来粉饰国家叙事。	But they have also introduced memory laws with essentially the opposite aim: to whitewash national narratives by shifting the responsibility for historical atrocities entirely onto others, whether Hitler’s Germany or Stalin’s Soviet Union.
相反，目前令人失望的局面正是来自结构改革逻辑：大部分改革的好处要很迟才会到来，而不是在一国真正需要它们时到来。	Instead, the current disappointment arises from the very logic of structural reform: most of the benefits come much later, not when a country really needs them.
2008年11月，载有墨西哥国家安全顾问胡安·卡米罗·马利罗（Juan Camilo Mourino）的飞机神秘坠毁。	In November, 2008, a plane carrying Juan Camilo Mourino, Mexico’s national security advisor, crashed under mysterious circumstances.
但是这一先导性工作现在处于停滞状态，而数以百万计的农民取得有效而对环境无害危机解决途径的希望也停滞了。	But the pioneering work is now on hold, as are the hopes of millions of farmers for an effective, environmentally friendly answer to the crisis.
2008年为数不多的积极结果之一是G-20全球影响力的加强；理论上，G-20是远比G-7代表性更强的国际领导力论坛。	One of the few positive consequences of the 2008 financial crisis was the elevation of the G-20's global role; in principle, it is a far more representative forum for international leadership than the G-7 ever was.
普瑞德-威利综合症则有如下特征，肌张力差，性激素水平低下以及大脑控制饱饿感的部分出现缺陷，从而导致过度进食和肥胖。	Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by poor muscle tone, low levels of sex hormones, and a defect in the part of the brain that controls feelings of satiety or hunger, which leads to overeating and obesity.
尽管ICC的总检察官Luis Moreno-Ocampo表示有信心将巴希尔绳之以法，但究竟如何操作还是个未知数。	While the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, expresses confidence that Bashir will be brought to justice, it is unclear how this will happen.
正如在线支付系统PayPal的联合创始人彼得·蒂耶（Peter Thiel）曾经指出的那样 ： “ 我们本想要能飞的汽车；谁知却最终收到了140个推特字符 。 ”	It certainly didn’t resolve the big problems, such as eradicating poverty or enabling us to reach Mars. As PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel once noted: “We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.”
是的，我们的政府的主要职责是保护我们；但每时每刻都有人死去，并且死因通常不公正；对于我们追求或可以追求多大程度保护的界线也不清晰。	Yes, our government’s primary job is to protect us; but people die all the time, often unfairly, and there are limits on how much protection we seek or even allow.
考虑到几个重要政府对投票抱有顽固的批评立场，以及若干成员国内部抗议和欧洲怀疑主义党派的势力陡增，将要进行的谈判面临着巨大的困难。	These negotiations will be much harder in view of the spectacular repudiation of a number of key governments at the ballot box, together with the potent rise of protest and Euroskeptic parties in several member states.
欧洲国家放弃繁荣的发展方式，依仗追求理论化的观点，并且这些观点脱离了国际视角，这样做对欧洲而言真的是理智的吗？	But they should not be alone. Is it reasonable that Europe’s countries give up a niche of prosperity on ideological grounds that are irrelevant from a global perspective?
如果人民银行现在只是进一步拉平不受其干预约束的卖出价，那么它就是在进一步靠近完全基于市场的汇率机制。	If the PBOC is now simply moving closer to averaging the offer prices that are not subject to its interference, it is moving closer to an entirely market-based exchange-rate regime.
诚然，一些新兴市场企业累积的美元计价外债数量令人担忧，但许多外国央行拥有充足的美元资产，特别是亚洲。	Although it is true that several emerging-market firms have piled up worrisome quantities of dollar-denominated external debt, many foreign central banks are brimming with dollar assets, especially in Asia.
知道目前，美国人通过从轻易受到影响的外国人那里廉价借钱并且把钱投资于高回报的外国资产、土地以及债券而攫取利润。	Until now, Americans have been raking in profits by borrowing cheaply from pliant foreigners and investing the money in high-yield foreign equities, land, and bonds.
蒸汽机或老式汽车的工作原理一目了然，而现代的汽车飞机如此复杂，以至于这些高科技产品的操纵者对其实际工作���理毫无概念。	In contrast to a steam engine or an old-fashioned automobile, whose operations were easily comprehensible, modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their operators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works.
虽然各国的尤其是在欧洲的众多分析家们已经得出结论，认为这类事件在可预见的将来不可能发生，但印度却是个例外。	While many analysts in a wide variety of nations, especially in Europe, have concluded that such an event could not occur there in the foreseeable future, India is an exception.
伊朗可以把公布伊朗人经常引用但是从来没有被人看见的关键文件作为一个良好的开端－例如，据传规定伊斯兰教禁止从事核武器的生产、储存和使用的阿亚图拉·哈梅内伊的裁定？	A good start would be to publish key documents that are constantly referred to by Iranians but never seen – say, Ayatollah Khamenei’s fatwa that reportedly rules that Islam prohibits the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons?
其新成立的全球基础设施便利（Global Infrastructure Facility，GIF）将动员全球退休基金和主权财富基金投资作为具体资产类别的基础设施。	Its new Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) will mobilize global pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in infrastructure as a specific asset class.
发自伦敦 — — 法国作家莫里哀的古典主义喜剧《伪君子》告诉我们，正是放任骄傲 — — 而非诉诸理性 — — 决定了一个人的行为无可避免地以糟糕收场。	LONDON – In his classic comedy “Tartuffe, or The Impostor,” Molière shows that allowing pride, rather than reason, to dictate one’s actions invariably ends badly.
无论如何，把经过基因改造的运动员贬斥为突变异种或非人类在道德上站不住脚，因为它引发了与其它生物特征，尤其是种族、性别和残疾相联系的同样的偏见，而我们对这些偏见理应深恶痛绝。	In any case, to describe genetically modified athletes as mutants or inhuman is morally suspect, for it invokes the same kind of prejudice that we deplore in relation to other biological characteristics, particularly race, gender, and disability.
华盛顿—拉马福萨（Cyril Ramaphosa）在12月的南非执政党非国大党领导人竞争中胜出，这是总统祖玛遭到否定的明确标志。	WASHINGTON, DC – Cyril Ramaphosa’s victory in December’s contest to lead South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) was a resounding repudiation of President Jacob Zuma.
这些和其他许多例子表明，如果政府能提供多样化的、相对具体的、与时俱进的正确的公共品组合，企业可以变得更加高效。	As these and many other examples show, business can become more efficient if governments provide the right combination of a diverse, relatively specific, and evolving set of public goods.
研究人员推测大约5，000年前，人类首次在非洲感染结核病，而后这种疾病迅速沿着贸易路线传播到全球几乎每一个角落。	Researchers theorize that humans first acquired TB in Africa about 5,000 years ago, and that the disease then swiftly spread along trade routes to nearly every corner of the globe.
与此同时这些妥协方案和所有财务报表或者女式泳衣有着同样的特质：那就是它们试图掩盖的部分才是最精彩的地方。	But those compromises are like statistics or skimpy swimsuits: what they show is less important than what they hide.
Spitfire战机飞行员被披头士、滚石、奇想等有力的自由象征所取代，他们的音乐如同一股清风横扫欧洲和美国。	Spitfire pilots were replaced as vigorous symbols of liberty by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Kinks, whose music swept across Europe and the United States like a gust of fresh air.
这些行为之所以有问题，原因在于它阻碍了资金的有效流动。 同样，外国政府也可以用同样的方式来对付非本国的银行。	Such actions are problematic not only because they insulate inefficient forms of production, but also because foreign countries respond by adopting similar measures towards their national champions, so that everyone is worse off.
这部“推土机”已经成为大多数以色列人的祖父，和西方外交的最后一张牌—对于意料之外的美国人和意料之中的欧洲人都是如此。	The “bulldozer” had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy, for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans, too.
《华盛顿邮报》媒体专栏玛格丽特·苏利文（Margaret Sullivan）最近观察道，对美国总统特朗普的报道狭隘地聚焦于他的用词，却忽视了他的政策。	As the Washington Post’s media columnist Margaret Sullivan recently observed, coverage of US President Donald Trump has focused narrowly on his words, at the expense of his policy.
我们的发病大部分是随机的，即使我们的医生无法告诉我们未来几年我们会得什么病，或者无法在我们得病时消除我们的所有痛苦，但我们仍乐于接受他们所能提供的帮助。	Our maladies are largely random, and even if our doctors cannot tell us which ones we will have in the next year, or eliminate all of our suffering when we have them, we are happy for the help that they can provide.
但日本的经济前沿绝不仅限于亚洲合伙太平洋，而是要延伸到拉丁美洲和非洲，因此，我们更应该抛弃长期以来的内向角度。	But Japan’s economic frontiers extend well beyond Asia and the Pacific, to Latin America and Africa – more reason to abandon our long-held inward-looking perspective.
一战后，国际社会实施了所谓的《毒气协议 》 （ Gas Protocol ） ， 禁止使用化学武器和生物武器。	After World War I, the international community adopted the so-called Gas Protocol, to prohibit the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons.
这一观点认为，如果不存在可让渡的生产性资料个人所有权，就无法找到充分的激励追求发展政策，而共同资源 （ “ 共有物 ” ） 将被过度利用和低效使用。	Absent alienable individual ownership of productive resources, it is asserted, there will be insufficient means and incentives to pursue development initiatives, and shared resources (the “commons”) will be over-exploited and used inefficiently.
澳大利亚、新西兰和加拿大分别为27 % 、 28 % 、 和20 % ， 这部分要归因于这些国家积极的移民政策。	In Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, it is 27%, 28%, and 20%, respectively, a consequence in part of these countries’ activist immigration policies.
在这一点上，卡钦斯基正在模仿他的偶像，两次世界大战之间的波兰领袖约瑟夫·毕苏斯基（尽管这位“波兰第一元帅”确实曾经两次担任总理 ） 。	In this, Kaczyński is emulating his idol, the interwar leader Józef Piłsudski (though the “First Marshal of Poland” did go on to serve as prime minister twice).
正如英格兰银行马克·卡尼（Mark Carney，我猜他也听了默多克的演讲）在今年早些时候所言 ， “ （未经）深思熟虑的市场原教旨主义可能毁灭对资本主义本身的长期活力至关重要的社会资本 。 ”	As the Bank of England’s Governor Mark Carney (who I assume also heard Murdoch’s lecture) remarked earlier this year, “[U]nchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself.”
当前经济状况的逻辑意味着政府应该利用超低利率的时机来投资于可以刺激需求和改善经济结构的基础设施项目。	The logic of current economic conditions implies that governments should be taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to invest in infrastructure projects, which would both stimulate demand and improve the structure of the economy.
毕竟，他将向穆勒的检察官们提供与弗拉基米尔·普京总统关系密切的某些俄罗斯寡头的罪证 — — 这些人对敢于背叛他们的人从不特别温和。	After all, he would be giving Mueller’s prosecutors the goods on some Russian oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin – folks who are not particularly gentle toward people who betray them.
感染了牛海绵状脑病却没有明显症状的个体对其它人构成了威胁，有可能通过输血或手术造成变异型克雅氏病的二次传染。	Individuals infected with BSE who remain in an asymptomatic state during their lives could represent a risk to others of potential secondary transmission of variant CJD through blood transfusion or surgery.
这一方法帮助许多世界级超级企业崛起，也给劳动力市场和社会带来了严重问题，因为它摧毁基于旧技能的中层岗位的速度快于基于新技能的同等岗位的创造速度。	As this approach facilitates the rise of global super-firms, it creates serious problems for labor markets and societies, because it destroys mid-level jobs based on old skills faster than comparable jobs based on new skills can be created.
此外，随着发达经济体竞争力日益提高，以及中国在价值链中地位的攀升，更多的投入品需要在各国国内就地解决。	And, as advanced economies become more competitive, and as China moves up the value chain, more inputs are being sourced within countries.
她还援引了印度教与自然世界的深刻联系来说明“河流崇拜，山丘崇拜，树木崇拜”是“印度的文化遗产 ” 。	“River worship, mountain worship, tree worship,” she said, invoking Hinduism’s deep connections to the natural world, “is India’s cultural heritage.”
疲软的增长已经降至2 % （ 在2010年有过短暂的反弹 ） ， 产出出现大规模负缺口，这表明总就业情况的恢复将非常缓慢，在这种情况下，各国仍采取了收紧财政政策。	Fiscal policy was being tightened when growth was languishing below 2% (after bouncing back in 2010), and sizeable negative output gaps suggested that overall employment would be slow to recover.
如果特朗普真的关注国家安全，那么令人奇怪的是，美国为什么不将地下矿石指定为抵抗未来敌对行动的战略储备。	If Trump really is concerned about national security, then one wonders why the US is not keeping ore in the ground as a strategic reserve for future hostilities.
更加多元化的马哈拉施特拉邦的奥兰加巴德（Aurangabad）城市集群是不少印度最大的种子公司的所在地，拥有活跃的汽车、制药和糖生产行业，同时也是旅游枢纽，坐落着阿旃陀（Ajanta）和艾洛拉（Ellora）石窟。	The more diversified Aurangabad cluster, in Maharashtra, is home to some of India’s largest seed companies, an active automotive, pharmaceutical, and sugar-manufacturing industry, and a tourism hub that includes the Ajanta and Ellora caves.
相反，美国容许在以色列政府缺乏任何行动的情况下出现一个政治真空，而如今这个真空就被“阿拉伯觉醒”所填补了。	Instead, the US allowed a political vacuum to form in the absence of any movement on the part of Israel’s government. This vacuum has now been filled by the Arab Awakening.
但鉴于包括共同文化或环境 — — 或随机因素 （ “ 基因漂变 ” ） 在内的多重原因均可造成某种特质随时间推移发生可以衡量的变化，因此证明这种现象的研究非常罕见。	But, given that measurable alterations in a trait over time can occur for many reasons – including those related to shared culture or environment – or randomly (“genetic drift”), studies demonstrating this phenomenon are rare.
不仅他是如此：在每一个伟大的帝国背后，都有一位伟大的哲学家和历史学家，他的世界观推动帝国带着合法性甚至神圣性前进。	And he was not unique: behind every great empire has been a great philosopher or historian whose worldview imbued the imperial drive with legitimacy and even sacred significance.
这将导致英国国会中支持脱欧的英国独立党的兄弟党派五星运动（Five Star Movement）上台掌权。	That could bring to power the Five Star Movement, a partner of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party in the European Parliament.
这些新技术实现了个人赋权 — — 特别是给快速增长的年轻人口 — — 也让经济和社会发展走上了康庄大道。	These new technologies empower people – most notably the rapidly growing youth population – and create new avenues for economic and social development.
成功需要每年投入6,000亿美元，涉及到的领域包括环境修复和保护、可再生能源和能源效率，以及可持续交通系统。	Success will require an estimated $600 billion in investment each year, in areas including environmental remediation and protection, renewable energies and energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation systems.
从1985到1995年雅克·德洛尔任委员会主席以来，再也没有有远见或政治影响力的领袖担任过委员会主席职务。	Not since Jacques Delors was President of the Commission, from 1985 to 1995, has that position been filled by a leader with any vision or political clout.
黎巴嫩潜在的碳氢化合物财富的确可以协助这个国家完成转型，同时为中东其他能源生产国提供一种模式用于参照。	Lebanon’s potential hydrocarbon wealth could indeed transform the country, as well as providing a model for other Middle Eastern energy producers to follow.
如果唯一的结果是降低其外交政策的可靠性和可预见性 — — 甚至更糟，招致别人的误解 — — 那么答案当然是不需要。	If the outcome is to make its foreign policy less reliable and predictable – or, worse, susceptible to misunderstanding – then it certainly does not.
左翼意识形态（特别是在英国）更多地来源于某些基督教道德传统 （ “ 比马克思更加卫理公会 ” ） 而非任何政治教条。	Left-wing ideology, especially in Britain, owed more to certain Christian moral traditions (“more Methodist than Marx”) than to any political dogma.
但仍有八个国家没有签署全面禁止核试验条约，这使该条约无法产生效力，其对全球安全的作用也没有纳入核安全峰会的日程。	Yet the failure of eight countries to ratify the CTBT has prevented it from entering into force, and its contribution to global security has so far not been included on the NSS agenda.
奥斯汀，德克萨斯—四百年前，约翰·罗尔夫（John Rolfe）用从西印度群岛偷来的烟草种子发展出弗吉尼亚州第一宗盈利的出口生意，扰乱了西班牙加勒比海殖民地的烟草贸易。	AUSTIN, TEXAS – Four hundred years ago, John Rolfe used tobacco seeds pilfered from the West Indies to develop Virginia’s first profitable export, undermining the tobacco trade of Spain’s Caribbean colonies.
同样，阵亡抚恤金仅仅是50万美元，大大低于死亡的一生全部经济成本的标准估计。 有时也把它称作生命的统计学价值（在610万美元到650万美元之间 ） 。	Similarly, payments for those who are killed amount to only $500,000, which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death, sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ($6.1 to $6.5 million).
美国和其他很多发达国家的模式则恰好相反，随着其国内生产及出口资本密集度的提升，他们的经常账户余额均出现了恶化。	This pattern contrasts with that of the United States and many other advanced countries, which have experienced a deterioration of their current-account balances as their production and exports have become more capital-intensive.
但美国回归亚洲中心舞台的风光面临着中国战略雄心的制约，其充当亚洲主要安全锚所要面对着诸多关键性的挑战。	But the heady glow of America’s return to center stage in Asia has obscured key challenges in remaining the region’s principal security anchor in the face of China’s strategic ambitions.
真相是传统西方列强尽管有诸多共同点，但在许多方面仍然是多样化的，从能源政策 — — 欧洲碳氢化合物依赖远大于美国 — — 到安全莫不如此。	The truth is that the traditional Western powers, despite having plenty in common, diverge in many areas, from energy policy – Europe is far more dependent on hydrocarbons than the US – to security.
在邻国也门陷入一场代理战争僵局的沙特人高兴地看到特朗普正在考虑增加援助来驱逐伊朗侵占其战略后院的行动。	The Saudis, bogged down in a proxy war with Iran in neighboring Yemen, are elated that Trump is contemplating an increase in assistance to repel Iranian encroachment from their strategic backyard.
意大利和西班牙等传统天主教欧洲国家有自由堕胎法，但拉丁美洲仍保留着最虔诚的信仰，保持着这个世界最严格的法律禁忌。	While traditionally Roman Catholic European countries like Italy and Spain have liberalized their abortion laws, Latin America has remained true to the faith, maintaining some of the world’s strictest legal prohibitions.
伦敦 — — 马琳·勒庞，法国极右翼国家阵线领袖声称爱国主义和全球主义之战将成为21世纪一场决定性的战争。	LONDON – Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Front, claims that the twenty-first century’s defining battle will be between patriotism and globalism.
而欧盟则提供这一套共同规则，通过共同的机构，让每一个国家 — — 即使是最小的 — — 都能有发言权。	The EU provides this set of common rules, buttressed by common institutions that give every country, even the smallest, a say.
但那些刚刚遭遇房价泡沫爆破的国家则不太会产生另一场房价泡沫,因为趋向保守的政府政策可能会减少对住房的补贴，而这些国家当前的市场气氛似乎也无法催生泡沫。	But another housing bubble is not imminent in countries where one just burst. Conservative government policies will probably reduce subsidies to housing, and the current mood in these markets does not seem conducive to a bubble.
士气低落的问题缺乏善意和体面；这是习俗和礼仪的失败，是社会目标的缺失，是辨别对错以采取正确行动的能力或意愿的减弱。	Low morale results from too little kindness and decency; it is a failure of custom and manners, a loss of social purpose, a diminution of the ability or the will to distinguish right from wrong and then to act rightly.
再回到我们先前的类比，街头的帮派不能攫取政治权力，但他们肯定能将使所在的街区置于危险、落后和可怕的状态。	To return to the analogy, urban street gangs cannot seize political power, but they can certainly keep their neighborhoods dangerous, backward, and grim.
丰裕家庭花费收入和财富的比例较低，因此，不平等性的升高会带来总体消费水平的降低，从而制约已不堪总需求不足重负的经济复苏。	Given that affluent households spend a smaller share of their incomes and wealth, greater inequality translates into lower overall consumption, thereby hindering the recovery of economies already burdened by inadequate aggregate demand.
安卡拉—如果我们真的生活在“地球村”中，通过商业、金融和社会联系彼此，那么某地非正式经济活动就真的会对其他地方产生消极影响。	ANKARA – If it is true that we live in a “global village,” bound to one another through commercial, financial, and social ties, then it is also true that informal economic activity in one part of the world has a negative impact elsewhere.
相对1995—2007年趋势的累计产出损失，目前美国为GDP的78 % ， 欧元区为GDP的60 % 。	Cumulative output losses relative to the 1995-2007 trends now stand at 78% of annual GDP for the US, and at 60% for the eurozone.
他是产业政策的坚定鼓吹者，这将会让他与欧盟委员会和其他许多领导人产生巨大的对立。 他还深深地不信任金融市场，还经常主张更多的监管。	He is a staunch advocate of industrial policies, which will lead him into sharp confrontation with the European Commission and many of his colleagues.
其实有玩笑认为默克尔会像战后德国首任领袖康拉德·阿登纳一样终身担任总理职务（德国并没有设立任期限制 ） 。	Indeed, as with postwar Germany’s first leader, Konrad Adenauer, there are jokes about Merkel being Chancellor for life (Germany has no term limits).
通常发生的情况是，新闻圈根据先入为主地认定观众和读者喜欢什么，而不是根据他们实际喜欢什么来采取行动。	Very often, the news cycle is driven by assumptions about what viewers or readers might like, rather than what they actually want.
让作为税收替代的能源税尤其作为防务措施具有吸引力的地方是，它在让欧洲更为安全、环保而且富有的同时保持福利国家毫发无损。	What makes the energy imposed as a tax substitution tax particularly attractive as a defense measure is that it leaves the welfare state intact while making Europe safer, greener, and richer.
这一决定在法国（包括���社会主义者之间）仍有争议，但奥朗德很明白，以欧洲防务政策之孱弱是断然无法与北约抗衡的。	That decision remains controversial in France, including among Socialists, but Hollande is well aware of the weaknesses of a European defense policy that simply cannot compete with NATO.
这意味着官方增长率没有反映与空调、抗癌药物、新手术流程以及其他许多普通创新一起到来的真实收入的提高。	That means that the official growth rate does not reflect the rise in real incomes that came with air conditioning, anti-cancer drugs, new surgical procedures, and the many more mundane innovations.
摩根大通首席财务官玛丽安妮·莱克（Marianne Lake）表示，这笔罚款中有大约70亿美元可以适用于税收扣减，也就是说，被当作必要的常规经营费用处理。	Marianne Lake, JP Morgan’s chief financial officer, has suggested that about $7 billion of the fine is likely to be tax deductible, that is, treated as a form of necessary and usual business expense.
此外，69%的人认为美国在阿富汗战争后面临的恐怖主义威胁并未减弱，而71%的人表示伊拉克的经验表明美国应该更加谨慎地使用武力。	Moreover, 69% do not believe that the US is safer from terrorism since the war in Afghanistan, and 71% say that the experience in Iraq shows that the US should take greater care in how it uses force.
既然有这些新科技，生产率也即将大幅度提高，为何还有这么多人继续认为所有人都必须更多地工作、更晚地退出才能让经济保持竞争力？	Why, with all this new technology and imminent productivity increases, do so many continue to argue that everyone has to work more and retire much later in life if economies are to remain competitive?
土耳其对伊拉克北部地区实施的有限的军事打击除开会使伊拉克当局作出公开谴责和口头宣称伊拉克的主权外，不会再引起其他反应。	A limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty.
与列宁恶化社会条件将加速革命的信条如出一辙，Hojatieh认为，暴力、冲突和压迫升级将促成马赫迪的归来。	Akin in some ways to Lenin’s doctrine that worsening social conditions would hasten revolution, the Hojatieh believe that only increased violence, conflict, and oppression will bring the Mahdi’s return.
评论员苏利文（Andrew Sullivan）说 ： “ 我看到了我第一眼看到的那个人 … … 我看到了我自以为了解的总统 。 ”	As the commentator Andrew Sullivan put it, “I saw the person I first saw...I saw the president I thought I knew.”
第二天，他的这番话被广泛报道；但听众的行为只字未提，让读者产生了首相完全是主动向日本公民爆粗口的印象。	The next day, his words were reported widely; the behavior of the crowd, however, was not, leaving readers with the impression that their prime minister had, completely unprompted, yelled coarsely at Japanese citizens.
大多数人需要一个社会定义，但将这一定义依附在一座城市之上显然要比依附在一个全副武装并打算与敌人发生冲突的国家身上更好。	Most people need a communal identity, but it may well be better to find it in one’s attachment to a city than in attachment to a country that is armed and willing to engage in conflict with enemies.
因此，个性化用药的影响从短期看有利于病患方，但用大量临床试验来证明新药的安全性将给制药方带来巨大的开发成本。	Thus, the impact of personalized medicine in the short term might be positive at the patient’s bedside, but vast clinical trials to demonstrate the safety of new drugs will impose huge development costs that manufacturers might never recover.
为什么神经学家、分子生物学家、遗传学家和发展生物学家—这些以科研成果永久地改变了我们对自身的认识的男性和女性—对他们的未来却如此彷徨不安？	Why are neuroscientists, molecular biologists, geneticists, and developmental biologists – men and women whose discoveries have forever changed the way we understand ourselves – so uneasy about their futures?
若将新鲜食物剔除出物价指数，则通胀率将升至0.9 % ， 但若将能源剔除，通胀率将降至0.3 % 。	When fresh food is excluded from the price index, the rate rises to 0.9%, but falls to 0.3% when also excluding energy.
在“地球中心的王国”衰落了几个世纪之后，正在骄傲地崛起，恢复它曾经拥有的辉煌。 与此同时，俄罗斯也在跃跃欲试地企图恢复从前的帝国地位，但这似乎注定不会成功。	Whereas the “Middle Kingdom” is proudly regaining its former global status after centuries of decline, Russia is defiantly trying to resurrect its former imperial status, but in a manner that appears doomed to fail.
广义上说，租金作为一种收入形式，完全来源于对资产的所有权和控制权，而不是对经济资源的创新和创业型部署。	Rent, broadly defined, is income derived solely from the ownership and control of an asset, rather than from innovative, entrepreneurial deployments of economic resources.
EITC也获得了广泛的支持（在美国经济学会进行的调查中，四分之三的受访经济学家支持扩大EITC ） 。	The EITC also has broad backing (more than three-quarters of economists surveyed by the American Economic Association support expanding it).
建立欧洲“银行联盟”需要德国的首肯。 银行联盟意味着向欧洲央行让渡监督权，并建立一个清算倒闭银行的共同基金。	Germany’s consent was needed to create Europe’s “banking union,” which entailed the transfer of supervisory powers to the European Central Bank and the creation of a common fund to resolve failing banks.
虽然有一些多边发展银行和开发融资机构融资可被用于早期基础设施投资 — — 包括中国的丝路基金，世界银行以及联合国国际金融公司 — — 但这类融资的供应却受到了需求不足的拖累。	Although some MDB and DFI financing is available for early-stage infrastructure investment – including from China’s Silk Road Fund, the World Bank, and the International Finance Corporation – the supply of such financing is dwarfed by demand.
在这样的情形下，经济将逐渐疲软，使皇室难以继续收买中产阶级支持，让东部和南部的反对派有能力打击政府的权威。	In such a scenario, the economy would gradually weaken, hampering the royal family’s ability to continue buying middle-class support, while enabling rebel groups in the east and the south to erode the government’s authority.
当然，如果历史能够提供任何借鉴，那么我们可以了解实现从国家统治到执行监管的转变是一个十分困难的过程。	Of course, if history is any indication, the shift from a dirigiste state to a regulatory one will not be easy.
各种各样的性别歧视让女性处于性奴役、人口买卖、包办婚姻的风险之下，剥夺了女性不可侵犯的权利，也破坏了生命的平等性。	In all of its forms, gender discrimination makes women vulnerable to sexual slavery, trafficking, and forced marriage, deprives women of their inalienable rights, and diminishes their quality of life.
事实上，特朗普的煽动及不停谴责媒体是“人民公敌”的模式已经令很多人深信其追随者有可能针对新闻媒体从业人员发起暴力行动。	In fact, Trump’s pattern of incitement and routine denunciations of the media as “the enemy of the people” had convinced many that some of his followers might resort to violence against members of the press.
在几乎所有努力折戟沉沙之后，国际外交已经越来越多地被有关制裁的探讨所取代 — — 人们热衷于讨论如何运用制裁和谈判两种方式来迫使伊朗就范。	With just about every diplomatic effort failing to yield results, international efforts have increasingly given way to discussions about sanctions – and what mix of them would be needed to bring Iran to heel.
如今学生债务存量高达1.2万亿美元，其中超过60%由收入最低的四分之一家庭（即净财富少于8,500美元的家庭）承担	It now stands at well over $1.2 trillion, more than 60% of which is held by the bottom quartile of households (those with a net worth of less than $8,500).
出人意料的是，低三种选择的修正版 — — 104名巴勒斯坦囚犯将在谈判的各阶段被释放 — — 最终促成了谈判重启。	Unexpectedly, a modified version of the third option – whereby 104 Palestinian prisoners will be released in phases over the course of the negotiations – ultimately facilitated the resumption of talks.
然而讽刺地是，刚掌权的民主反对派却想恢复Burma这个名字，因为他们视Myanmar这一名字为独裁的象征 — — 而这正是他们想摒弃的东西。	Ironically, however, the newly empowered democratic opposition would like to bring back the name Burma, viewing “Myanmar” as emblematic of the dictatorship that they wish to leave behind.
这出剧写于欧洲三十年战争期间。 这场十七世纪上半叶的战争摧毁了欧洲，直到1648年签订威斯特伐利亚和约（Peace of Westphalia）才宣告结束。	The play is set during Europe’s Thirty Years’ War, which devastated Europe in the first half of the seventeenth century, ending only with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.
甚至有观点认为同性恋因为“非自然”所以是错误的，甚至是“对我们性能力的扭曲 ” ， 而性能力按理只能为生育的目的而存在。	Sometimes it is claimed that homosexuality is wrong because it is “unnatural,” and even a “perversion of our sexual capacity,” which supposedly exists for the purpose of reproduction.
印度的耻辱溃败加速了其总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁（Jawaharlal Nehru）的死亡，但它也促进了这个国家的军事现代化和政治崛起。	India’s humiliating rout hastened the death of its prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru; but it also set in motion the country’s military modernization and political rise.
每当上一代统治者兑现掌权的非法收益，都会引发继任者更为强烈的掠夺欲望，他们害怕轮到自己掌权时利益已经被瓜分殆尽。	As each preceding generation of rulers cashes in its illicit gains from holding power, the successors are motivated by both the desire to loot even more and the fear that there may not be much left by the time they get their turn at the trough.
纽黑文—美联储试图退出其非常规货币政策，这一政策面临着一对矛盾：它成功地阻止了经济灾难，但没能铸就强健的经济复苏。	NEW HAVEN – As the US Federal Reserve attempts to exit from its unconventional monetary policy, it is grappling with the disparity between the policy’s success in preventing economic disaster and its failure to foster a robust recovery.
例如，纳西姆·尼古拉斯·塔勒布（Nassim Nicholas Taleb）在他2004年出版的书《被随机性愚弄的傻瓜》中提到经济科学 ： “ 你可以用方程式来掩盖自己的把戏，没有人能够揭穿你，因为没有东西可以进行对照实验。	For example, in his 2004 book Fooled by Randomness, Nassim Nicholas Taleb said of economic sciences: “You can disguise charlatanism under the weight of equations, and nobody can catch you since there is no such thing as a controlled experiment.”
伦敦 — — 35年前，作为全球考察的一部分，查尔斯·伯顿和我途经北极穿越北冰洋，之后在一块快速移动的冰盖上露营了三个月。	LONDON – Thirty-five years ago, as part of a global expedition, Charles Burton and I traveled across the Arctic Ocean via the North Pole, camping for three months on a fast-moving ice floe.
总之，中国必须将重点从实现GDP增长目标转向营造促进创新与竞争的环境，从而允许市场制定价格并提高资源分配效率。	In short, China must shift its focus from meeting GDP growth targets to creating an environment that fosters innovation and competition, thereby enabling market forces to set prices and allocate resources more effectively.
但这也无法确保塔利班会动用武力阻止他们的基地组织盟友在阿富汗境内重组武装力量，并利用这些力量对其他国家发动新一轮恐怖袭击。	But it is hard to imagine the Taliban using force to prevent their al-Qaeda allies from reestablishing a military presence in Afghanistan and exploiting that presence to organize additional terrorist attacks in other countries.
但消灭无法使用且维护价格昂贵的核武器是很容易实现的目标 — — 是我们能够轻松把握和消除的风险因素。	But nuclear weapons, unusable and extremely expensive to maintain, are low-hanging fruit – a risk that we can easily grasp and eliminate.
除此之外，在北方邦旅游部门发行的本地主要旅游景点手册也将泰姬陵这个该州（以及该国）的主要旅游目的地排除在外。	Furthering this erasure, the Uttar Pradesh tourism department issued a brochure of the state’s main attractions, but left out the Taj Mahal, the state’s (and the country’s) main tourism destination.
在特朗普总统任期第一年与朝鲜独裁者相互辱骂时，那个国家的核计划已经稳步向前推进，而美国也距离违背所有人意愿的战争越来越近。	While the president spent his first year in office trading insults with the dictator of North Korea, that country has moved steadily forward with its nuclear program, and the United States has moved steadily closer to a war that no one wants.
特朗普政府最近公布了一份十年预算计划，被批缺少连贯性，也没有给出明确的税收政策。 这样的批评非常中肯。	The administration recently released a ten-year budget plan that has been rightly criticized for its lack of coherence and its failure to describe explicit tax policies.
此外，有些国家的政府债务负担同欧洲边缘国家的债务负担一样大，甚至更大，美国和日本就是两个最好的例子。	Moreover, there are countries with government-debt burdens that are as large, if not larger, than those on Europe’s periphery – the United States and Japan being prime examples.
这一计划意味着克里姆林宫将为卡德罗夫 — — 开始是艾哈迈德·卡德罗夫，在他死后，便是他的儿子，拉姆赞·卡德罗夫 — — 提供广泛的自治权力（但不能名义独立）和巨额资金。	The plan implied that the Kremlin would provide the Kadyrovs – first Akhmad Kadyrov, and then, after his death, his son, Ramzan – broad autonomy (independence in all but name) and huge sums of money.
发达和贫穷国家都有大量例子，不负责任的盈利性学校糊弄家长、忽视学生（唐纳德·特朗普的伪善的特朗普大学就是其中之一 ） 。	There are abundant examples, in rich and poor countries alike, of fly-by-night for-profit schools that dupe parents and neglect students (Donald Trump’s sham Trump University being a case in point).
由于气候变化的影响，非洲正在经历1945年来最严重的干旱，尤其是在南苏丹、索马里、埃塞俄比亚和北尼日利亚等地区。	Owing to the effects of climate change, Africa is experiencing its worst drought since 1945, especially in Southern Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Northern Nigeria.
文化的“零点”是重要的，因为它们构成了一条分割线 — — 泾渭分明的“之前”和“之后 ” — —给私人和公共生活的发展造成了根本性影响。	Cultural “zero points” are important because they serve as a dividing line – a clear demarcation of “before” and “after” that holds fundamental implications for the development of private and public life.
某些经济学家，包括我本人在内，的确警告过在现有的管理、稳定及合法化市场制度的边界以外推进经济全球化的后果。	Some economists, including me, did warn about the consequences of pushing economic globalization beyond the boundaries of institutions that regulate, stabilize, and legitimize markets.
已经有证据表明，女记者开始自我审查，不再撰写某些问题的报道，特别是基于权利的问题和影响到边缘群体的问题。	Already there is evidence that women are self-censoring and drawing back from writing about certain issues, specifically rights-based issues and those affecting marginalized communities.
美国总统特朗普去年夏天在勃兰特下跪的纪念碑前发表了演讲，受到了波兰公众的热烈响应，原因就在于他没有偏离PiS所认可的叙事。	US President Donald Trump’s speech in Warsaw last summer was well received by the Polish public precisely because he did not deviate from the PiS-endorsed narrative.
科罗拉多大学波尔德分校（University of Colorado, Boulder）的凯西·费斯勒（Casey Fiesler）正在探索这一试验方法，他将以科技伦理为主题的课程大纲进行众包。	Casey Fiesler of the University of Colorado, Boulder, is pursuing just such experimentation by crowd-sourcing syllabi focused on tech ethics.
然而，即使是来自联合国的最悲观的预测也预期发展中国家的普通民众在2100年时会比现在更富裕，也因此能更好的应对这一挑战。	However, by 2100, even the most pessimistic forecasts from the UN expect the average person in the developing countries to be richer than now, and thus better able to cope.
阿亚图拉Mesbah Yazdi频频与艾哈迈迪内贾德一同在公开场合露面，他负责Hojatieh学会，许多什叶派将该学会视为极端分子。	Led by Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, who frequently appears with the Ahmadinejad, the Hojatieh society is considered by many Shia as the lunatic fringe.
为了保护欧洲公司从哈瓦那酒店中赚取的利润，欧盟将会停止邀请思想开放的人士来到使馆，并会按照独裁者及其附庸们的脸色来判断他们究竟是什么人。	To protect European corporations’ profits from their Havana hotels, the Union will cease inviting open-minded people to EU embassies, and we will deduce who they are from the expression on the face of the dictator and his associates.
而用超宽松货币政策来抵消财政紧缩又要冒风险 — — 在发达国家这意味着私人杠杆卷土重来，而在新兴经济体已经出现危险的杠杆上升溢出状况了。	But offsetting fiscal austerity with ultra-easy monetary policies risks fueling a resurgence of private leverage in advanced economies and already has produced the dangerous spillover of rising leverage in emerging economies.
RIGA — — 欧盟委员会不帮助所有欧盟成员国实现各自的《京都议定书》目标，反而将本应共同分担的责任推到最新成员国头上。	RIGA -- Instead of helping all EU member states to meet their own Kyoto goals, the European Commission is shifting what should be a shared burden onto its newest members, which are already the most environmentally efficient in the European Union.
显然，诗人兼哲学家保罗·瓦勒里（Paul Valéry）是正确的 ： “ 未来和其他所有东西一样，不再会与昨日相同 。 ”	Clearly, the poet and philosopher Paul Valéry was right: “The future, like everything else, is no longer what it used to be.”
但是，对大部分健康男性来说，美国预防服务专职小组（USPSTF ） — —由预防和初级治疗专家组成的独立领导小组 — — 公开反对普及PSA测试。	For most healthy men, however, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) – a leading independent panel of experts on prevention and primary care – has publicly recommended against widespread PSA tests.
潘基文还可以表明在当今世界恐怖主义的存在是没有正当理由的，这里的恐怖行动指的是国际上为了政治意图而对平民故意造成伤害的行为。	Ban can also make the case that there is no justification in today’s world for terror – defined here as the intentional harming of civilians for political purposes.
在共产党执政的最后几周里，马佐维耶茨基推动建立了谈判实现政治过渡的模式，这种模式直到今天依然为巨变中的其他社会提供信息、指引和激励。	In the final weeks of Communist rule, Mazowiecki helped to establish a model for negotiated political transition that still informs, inspires, and guides other societies on the cusp of change.
此外目前美国玉米产量的40%都已经用作提炼乙醇，而几年前这一比例还仅有5%左右，这意味着玉米价格必须提高以应对市场对食品，出口和乙醇生产的需求。	In addition, the fact that nearly 40% of the US corn crop is being used for ethanol, up from around 5% a few years ago, means that corn prices must be higher to meet the feed, export, and ethanol demands for corn.
在凡尔赛会议上，欧洲四大经济体 — — 德国、法国、意大利和西班牙 — — 支持由它们组成统一的核心的多速方针。	At a meeting at Versailles, the EU’s four largest economies – Germany, France, Italy, and Spain – endorsed a multi-speed approach that would establish them as a unified core.
具体地讲，我们需要同步推进有利于增长的结构性改革、加强需求管理、解决过度负债问题并改善地区和全球政策框架。	What is needed, in particular, is simultaneous progress on pro-growth structural reforms, better demand management, addressing pockets of excessive indebtedness, and improving regional and global policy frameworks.
不幸的是，我的许多同僚 — — 特别是编教科书的那几位 — — 将物理学描绘成一座壮丽无瑕的万丈高楼，却忽视了这个由众多古怪模型所构成的理论大杂烩其实早已千疮百孔。	Unfortunately, many of my colleagues – particularly those who write textbooks – present physics as a towering, seamless basilica, ignoring the gaps in our hodge-podge of skewed models.
选民们因为否决像“跨太平洋伙伴关系 ” （ TPP）这样的新自由贸易协议及重新谈判像北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）这样的已有协议而兴奋不已。	Voters were galvanized by the prospect of rejecting new free-trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and renegotiating old ones like the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
幸运的是，即使布什不明白这些基本准则，美国的法庭却是明白的，虽然它只是马后炮地迫使它的政府遵守这些条例。	Fortunately, even if Bush does not understand such basic principles, America’s courts do, and they are now, albeit belatedly, forcing his administration to abide by them.
这种情况往往预示着（通胀调整后）实际工资的上涨，这表明在脆弱的后危机复苏时代，落后的许多美国工人可能最终从强劲的经济增长中尝到甜头。	Such conditions usually foreshadow rising real (inflation-adjusted) wages, which would indicate that American workers, many of whom were left behind in the anemic post-crisis recovery, might finally reap benefits from the strong economy.
但阿拉伯地区需要的是基于项目的微观导向大手笔治理投资，这必须以商业环境的深度改革为条件，该地区的商业环境被公认为世界最差。	But what the Arab region needs are micro-oriented, project-based, and governance-heavy investments conditioned on deep reform of a business environment that is generally considered among the worst in the world.
为此他呼吁将欧元打造为“一个新的、更具主权意义的欧洲的工具 ” ， 并承诺要“推出一些加强欧元国际作用的举措 ” 。	He then called for the euro to become “the instrument of a new, more sovereign Europe,” and promised to “present initiatives to strengthen the international role of the euro.”

在这个问题上，自安倍经济学的第一支箭射出以来，日本已创造超过270万个工作岗位，并因此取得了重大的成功。	Here, Japan has been tremendously successful, creating more than 2.7 million jobs since the first arrow of Abenomics was launched.
苏丹自身的挑战在于改革整个石油行业，后者多年来遭到中国和马来西亚企业残酷和不负责任的开发，造成了灾难性的环境后果。	Its own challenge lies in reforming the entire oil industry, which for years has been brutally and irresponsibly exploited by Chinese and Malaysian companies, with devastating environmental consequences.
根据维也纳公约第22条 ， “ （外交）使团驻地神圣不可侵犯 ， ” 且“驻地所在东道国不能进入，除非有外交使团首脑允许 。 ”	According to Article 22 of the Convention, “the premises of [a diplomatic] mission shall be inviolable,” and a “receiving state may not enter them, except with the consent of the head of the mission.”

遗憾的是，国际法律和管辖的全球系统还太弱小，如果世界最强大国家的总统决意独自跳起战争，上述体系阻止不了他的一意孤行。	Unfortunately, the global system of international law and governance remains too weak to prevent the determined misbehavior of the president of the world's most powerful country if he is hell bent on starting a war on his own.
即使在后来的两次减税中 — — 1986年里根的第二期财政计划和2001年小布什的减税政策 — — 净国民储蓄率平均也有4.2 % ， 比当前水平高出一倍有余。	Even during the two tax cuts that followed – the second installment of Reagan’s fiscal program in 1986, and the initiatives of George W. Bush in 2001 – the net national saving rate averaged 4.2%, more than double the current level.
目前的全球经济危机是一个机遇，可以让我们进行新的试验，不仅可以解决这一危机，而且或许可以建立某些机制来帮助防止未来的危机。	The current global economic crisis is an opportunity for some new experimentation that might not only lead to its resolution, but might also set in place institutions that help to prevent future crises.
在过去两个世纪中，世界在降低婴儿死亡率方面取得了重大进展，普通妇女不再需要将生命中的五年时间用来怀孕，再将十年时间用来哺乳。	Over the past two centuries, the world has made significant strides in reducing infant mortality, such that the typical woman no longer has to spend five years of her life pregnant and another ten years nursing.
这不仅是对国际法的粗暴违反；也直接有悖于俄罗斯再三强调的任何国家都没有权利牺牲他国保证自身安全的说辞。	This was not only a gross violation of international law; it also directly contravened Russia’s oft-stated insistence that no country has the right to ensure its security at the expense of another.
（特朗普本人也参与了一场在空军一号上举行的会议，当时他正从上任总统后的第二次出访中回国，会议起草了一份掩盖特朗普大厦会晤内容的声明。 ）	(Trump himself participated in a meeting aboard Air Force One, as he returned from his second presidential trip abroad, to draft a statement to cover up what happened in that Trump Tower meeting.)
公共部门和私人部门 — — 单独行动以及大规模、长时间的合作 — — 需要以更严肃的态度思考如何对劳动力的再培训和再武装、增强劳动力流动性、职业培训和实习。	Both the public and private sectors – individually and through scalable and durable partnerships – need to think much more seriously about labor retraining and retooling programs, enhanced labor mobility, vocational training, and internships.
在卢旺达，GBD研究揭示，用固体燃料烹饪造成室内空气污染是主要致死原因，政府据此制定了一个计划，为最脆弱家庭提供了一百万只清洁炉灶。	In Rwanda, when the GBD study revealed that indoor air pollution from cooking with solid fuel was a leading cause of death, the government launched a program to distribute one million clean stoves to the most vulnerable households.

但1997年亚洲金融危机后，收入差距开始在整个地区拉大，印尼尤其严重，社会福利计划对于阻止不平等性的加剧几乎毫无作用。	But, since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, income gaps have widened throughout the region, and in Indonesia in particular, where social welfare programs have barely stemmed the rise in inequality.
佩雷茨的战略可能是从左翼政党争取选民，但是工党几乎肯定会失去中间派别选民（以及那些视国家安全为首要任务的人士）的支持而流向沙龙。	Peretz’s strategy may draw voters from other parties on the left, but Labor will most likely lose centrist voters (and those for whom national security is paramount) to Sharon.
印度尼西亚最近发生了两件戏剧性的释放事件：一是一位激进的穆斯林教士被从监狱里释放了出来，另一件是一份漂亮的男性杂志被投入了市场。	Indonesia recently witnessed a pair of dramatic releases: one a radical Muslim cleric from prison, the other a saucy men’s magazine from its editors.
在暴力驱逐独裁者索莫扎（Anastasio Somaza）后掌权的社会主义革命家，需要借助基督教上帝获得合法性，真实咄咄怪事。	That a socialist revolutionary – who first came to power after violently ousting the dictator Anastasio Somoza – should seek legitimacy in a Christian god is odd.
从20世纪80年代初到21世纪第一个十年中期，沙特阿拉伯一直是泛阿拉伯政坛的协调者，利雅得和吉大的宫殿吸引着整个阿拉伯世界的政治领袖。	From the early 1980’s to the mid-2000’s, Saudi Arabia was the coordinator of pan-Arab politics, with the palaces of Riyadh and Jeddah drawing political leaders from throughout the Arab world.
如果一个旨在促进繁荣和欧洲进一步整合的系统一直都导致了适得其反的效果，那么友好分手就比当前的僵局更好。	A system intended to promote prosperity and further integration has been having just the opposite effect. An amicable divorce would be better than the current stalemate.

他自身的利益，不论是身体还是道德上的，都不足以成为（受到权力约束）的原因 … … 他有权支配自己的身体和思想。	His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant....Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.
对印度和中国而言，基于化石燃料的经济发展轨迹可能会带来灾难，因为其庞大人口的巨额需求可能激化地缘政治紧张。	For India and China, an economic trajectory based on fossil fuels could spell catastrophe, as efforts to secure enough for their immense populations ratchet up geopolitical tensions.
更有甚者，德国央行（Bundesbank）仍然死抱住从德国惨痛的通胀经历中总结出来的过时的货币学说。	To make matters worse, the Bundesbank remains committed to an outmoded monetary doctrine rooted in Germany’s traumatic experience with inflation.
而且在这次争斗同时，美国派遣海豹突击队在深入巴基斯坦境内的一栋建筑中找到本·拉登，而且只在袭击行动结束后才通知了巴基斯坦政府。	And, in the midst of this tussle, the US sent Navy Seals to find Bin Laden at a compound deep in Pakistani territory, informing Pakistan’s government only after the raid was over.
持续60年的残酷镇压甚至都难以让西藏和新疆认同这一点，这从2008年的西藏人和2009年的维吾尔人爆乱中可以得知。	Six decades of ruthless repression has failed to win China acceptance even in Tibet and Xinjiang, as the Tibetan and Uighur revolts of 2008 and 2009 attested.
真相是，是布什 — — 他让美国陷入了阿富汗和伊拉克战争 — — 在2008年签署了部队地位协定（Status of Forces Agreement ） ， 根据该协定，美国要在三年内撤出所有驻伊拉克美军。	The truth is that it was Bush who, having plunged the US into war in Afghanistan and Iraq, in 2008 signed the Status of Forces Agreement that allotted three years to withdraw all US troops from Iraqi territory.
首先是W玻色子和Z玻色子的质量。 W玻色子和Z玻色子是弱相互作用的介质，比如阳光照射就是有它们传递的。	The first was the masses of the W and Z bosons – the messengers of the weak nuclear interactions, responsible, for example, for the shining sun.
北方牧场信托组织帮助牧民群体建立其赖以生存的有效环境治理机制，减少因为放牧权所引发的冲突，尤其是在干旱时期。	NRT has helped pastoralist communities establish effective governance mechanisms for the environment on which they depend, reducing conflict over grazing rights, especially in times of drought.
与一直在将战略“支点”从一个地区转向另一个地区的美国不同，中国正在实施从“国家间政治”向“网络间政治”的再平衡，着重于“连通”而非“控制 ” 。	Unlike the US, which has been engineering a strategic “pivot” from one geographic region to another, China is rebalancing from “politics among nations” to “politics among networks,” focusing on “connectivity” rather than “control.”
美国共和党总统候选人赫尔曼·凯恩的“999”计划呼吁在实行9%的个人及企业税率的同时，实行9%的国家销售税率。	In the US, the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain’s “9-9-9” plan calls for a 9% rate for personal and corporate taxes, together with a new 9% national sales tax.
事实上，这也许来的正是时候 — — 发达经济体人口老龄化意味着未来几十年中劳动力将减少 — — 而个人护理需求将增加。	In fact, this may come just in time – an aging population in developed economies implies a smaller workforce – and greater need for personal care services – in the coming decades.
美国学者约翰·贾沃尔（John Garver）用中国寓言很好地描述了这一局面 ： “ 青蛙在温吞水中感觉舒适又安全。	The American academic John Garver depicted it best using a Chinese fable: “A frog in a pot of lukewarm water feels quite comfortable and safe.
在巴基斯坦白沙瓦以南的克哈特（Kohat）区，在女接种员的帮助下，未接种儿童从30,000人下降到22,000人，拒绝接种的儿童数量也从月4,000人下降到400人。	In the Pakistani district of Kohat, south of Peshawar, female vaccinators have been credited with helping to lower the number of unvaccinated children from 30,000 to 22,000, and to reduce the number of vaccine refusals from around 4,000 to 400.
而统计方法错误和捏造事实的更惊人例子是哈佛经济学家卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）最为广泛引用的断言 — — 如果一国债务对GDP比率超过90 % ， 其经济增长会大幅度放缓。	An even more spectacular example of a statistical error and sleight of hand is the widely cited claim of Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that countries’ growth slows sharply if their debt/GDP ratio exceeds 90%.
像巴库提这样的当地法塔赫领袖掌握着民族主义武装的制高权力，它们组成了 “阿克萨烈士旅”这样的松散型组织。	Local Fatah leaders like Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of the Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades.
在整个非洲，中等学校和TVET系统正在实现转型，准备好用完成学生到工作者和参与度更高的公民的转变所必须的技能，来武装非洲的年轻头脑。	Across the continent, secondary schools and TVET systems are transforming themselves to prepare Africa’s young minds with the skills they need to make the transition from school to employment, and to become more engaged citizens.
三权分立，是美国建国领导人在Montesquieuz这样的哲学家的影响下建立起来的治国纲领。 但这一原则现如今将美国领向了几近瘫痪的状态。	The separation of powers, a principle established by the US founders under the influence of philosophers such as Montesquieu, is leading today to near-paralysis.
OUN在纳粹拒绝乌克兰独立后便与之决裂，最终与苏联人以及德国人被赶走后的波兰共产主义和反共产主义地下运动武装都有斗争。	The OUN broke with the Nazis after they denied Ukraine independence, and finally fought the Soviets and both the army of Communist Poland and the anticommunist Polish underground after the Germans were routed.
2015年，欧盟的DAC成员国将ODA预算中的97亿美元用在了各自国家的大约120万名寻求庇护者身上。	In 2015, the European Union’s DAC member states spent $9.7 billion of their ODA budgets on approximately 1.2 million asylum-seekers in their own countries.
此外，由于许多可再生能源技术是建立在已开采金属和矿物的基础上，因此全球矿业将在朝向低碳未来的转型中扮演关键角色。	Moreover, because many renewable energy technologies are built with mined metals and minerals, the global mining industry will play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon future.
但即使石油和天然气田几乎在2017年立即完成拍卖，而后成功得到开发，由此所产生的收入最早也要到2022年才会实际抵达。	But even if oil and gas blocks are auctioned off almost immediately, in 2017, and then successfully explored, the resulting revenues would not arrive until 2022 at the earliest.
对于6个月前开始的主席任期，听惯了布莱尔“充满热情的亲欧洲人士”的漂亮口号，这恐怕是一个令人哀伤的结局。	It is a sad conclusion to a presidency, launched six-months ago, with Blair’s claim that he was a “passionate pro-European”. Yet the full text of his speech tells it all.
鉴于经济增长缓慢、失业率居高不下（仅仅因为心灰意冷的工人退出就业大军失业率才有所降低）和通胀率远低于联储目标，现在并不是开始限制流动性的最好时机。	Given slow growth, high unemployment (which has fallen only because discouraged workers are leaving the labor force), and inflation well below the Fed’s target, this is no time to start constraining liquidity.
但欧洲央行的权力是欧元区所缺失的民主政治制度的技术替代物这一事实将是2013年的一个继续发酵的问题。	But the fact that the ECB’s power is only a technocratic substitute for the eurozone’s missing democratic political institutions will remain a growing problem in 2013.
由于这些对中国领导层不利的故事极为敏感，因此这些广受欢迎的报道通常被禁止，编辑因此被撤职，刊登或播报它们的媒体通常受到处罚。	Owing to great sensitivity about stories that cast China’s leadership in a bad light, these popular reports are frequently banned, editors are fired, and media outlets that publish or broadcast them are often punished.
发自新德里 — — 在经历了数十年国际制裁下的孤立和贫困之后，缅甸近来摇身一变成为了希望明灯和亚洲的潜在新亮点。	NEW DELHI – Isolated and impoverished by decades of international sanctions, Myanmar (Burma) has emerged in recent months as both a beacon of hope and a potential new Asian flashpoint.
过去20年来，世界直接外资的流量发生了迅猛的增长，从20世纪80年代的400亿美元一路飙升到了去年的9000亿美元。	World flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have soared over the past two decades, from $40 billion in the early 1980’s to $900 billion last year.
大约六年间，葛兰运动分子一直协助艾尔多安驱逐那些不肯忠于其柔性伊斯兰主义，却对土耳其世俗和民族主义理想宣誓效忠的军队、警察和其他公共部门干部。	Over the course of roughly six years, the Gülenists had helped Erdoğan to oust military and police cadres (among many other public-sector employees) who were loyal to Turkish secular and nationalist ideals, rather than to his own soft Islamism.
该党和由奥斯卡尔·拉方戴内领导的社会民主党异议人士结盟，鼓吹同样激进的提议。 由于左右两翼政府对失业大潮均无计可施，越来越多的法德两国选民似乎不再相信传统的解决方案。	With the evident failure of both leftist and rightist governments to stem the rising wave of unemployment, a growing part of the French and German electorates no longer seems to believe in traditional solutions.
首先，进步的政治经济必须基于对资本主义的坚定信念 — — 即基于大部分资产为私有、主要由市场指导生产和分配收入的经济体系。	First, a progressive political economy must be based on a firm belief in capitalism – that is, on an economic system in which most of the assets are privately owned, and markets largely guide production and distribute income.
海啸发生之后，美国和其它一些富裕国家似乎完全来得及重新考虑他们的援助计划，并有可能对那些最需要救济的国家追加援助资金。	In the wake of the tsunamis, it seems possible that the US and other wealthy countries will rethink their assistance programs and, possibly, step up their aid to those most in need.
此外，过去十年来意大利的经济增长一直很慢，而且看不到加速的迹象，这使得意大利即使实施了财政整合也很难降低公共债务负担。	Moreover, economic growth has been slow for the past decade, and is not accelerating, which will make it difficult to lower the public-debt burden even with fiscal consolidation.
换句话说，如今希腊已经实现了零初级预算赤字，如果其名义增长率超过其政府债务的平均利率，则其债务负担将会降低。	Stated differently, now that Greece has achieved a zero primary budget deficit, its debt burden will decline if its nominal growth rate exceeds the average interest that it pays on its government debt.
但是现在人们普遍认为，美国发动战争的谈判方式是一个错误 — — 这一错误使美国作为谈判一方失去了大量的信誉。	But it is now widely accepted that the way in which the US negotiated its way into war was a mistake – one that has cost it enormous credibility as a negotiating partner.
欧洲没有了萨科齐或者贝卢斯科尼，也没有了英国前首相撒切尔夫人，德国前总统赫尔穆特·科尔以及西班牙前首相何塞·玛丽亚·阿斯纳尔这样的人。	Europe has no Sarkozy or Silvio Berlusconi, but also no Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl, or José Maria Aznar.
他们指出，二战以来，如若危机爆发，则在信心危机结束、经济恢复增长后还将平均持续4.4年 — — 这是必须的“去杠杆化”所需要的时间。	They reckon that the average length of post-war crises has been 4.4 years – the time it takes for the necessary “de-leveraging” to occur – after which the crisis of confidence is over and economic growth revives.
“如果我们要在世界上实现真正的和平 ， ” 圣雄甘地在1931年、即英联邦成立前近二十年时说 ， “ 就必须从教育开始 。 ”	“If we are to reach real peace in this world,” Mahatma Gandhi said in 1931, nearly two decades before the Commonwealth was established, “we shall have to begin with the children.”
此外，尽管朝鲜一再破坏区域和平，但中国对这个流氓政权却给于无条件支持，这也是导致其他国家对中国是否认真对待其邻国的国家安全有所保留的重要原因。	China’s unconditional support for North Korea’s wayward regime, despite its repeated crimes against peace, is also a cause for concern about whether China will treat its neighbors’ security concerns with respect.
若要实现这一点，莫格里尼必须把自己当作受容克和欧洲理事会主席唐纳德·塔斯克（Donald Tusk）支持的领导者。	For that to happen, Mogherini must assert herself as a leader, backed by Juncker and the new European Council president, Donald Tusk.
身为一个在道德上和政治上都被宣传所腐蚀的国家 — — 苏联的前公民，我很清楚“新闻”武器化会造成什么伤害。	As a former citizen of a country – the Soviet Union – that was morally and politically corrupted by propaganda, I am well aware of the damage that can be done by weaponized “news.”
考虑到他在2003年多么不得人心，很多人认为他愿意交出权力，但需要找到确保他名声（和财产）的继任者。	Knowing the extent of his unpopularity in 2003, many believe that he was ready to leave power but needed a successor who would ensure that his legacy (and his wealth) survived.
他们联合起来反对像世界贸易组织（WTO）这样的多边机构，世贸组织是拥有准司法争端解决机制的唯一国际机构，也是谈判和执行全球贸易规则的主要论坛。	They rally against multilateral bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO) – the main forum for negotiating and implementing global trade norms and one of the only international organizations with a quasi-judicial dispute-settlement entity.
社会民主政府不断面临着财富的重新分配严重阻碍了经济增长的指责，并且无法使选民们相信为高等教育的另一次大扩张注入资金是有必要的。	Social-democratic governments have been on the defensive against those who claim that redistributing wealth exacts too high a cost on economic growth, and unable to convince voters to fund yet another massive expansion of higher education.
如果因此引发了自己支持者的反对，他会提醒他们民族团结和互相尊重、而不是狭隘的党派斗争，最终会使宇宙的道德之弧进一步倾向于公正。	And when his own supporters objected, he reminded them that national unity and mutual respect, not narrow partisanship, would eventually bend the moral arc of the universe toward justice.
比如说，如果一位首席执行官不可能赚取超过其企业普通员工收入一定倍数的收入，那么他花在损公肥私这件事上的精力也会有所限制。	If, for example, it becomes impossible for a CEO to earn more than a certain multiple of what the average worker in his or her firm is paid, there will be a limit to how much ingenuity the CEO directs toward pure self-enrichment.
低估的汇率只是各国用以推动出口并限制进口的政策之一。 实施这样的政策使得该国享有贸易顺差而其贸易伙伴们（包括美国）则出现逆差。	Undervalued exchange rates are only one of the policies that countries use to boost exports and restrain imports, so that they run trade surpluses, while their trading partners (including the US) run deficits.
伊斯兰国发言人坚持一字不差地奉行先知穆罕默德及其早期追随者制定的原始戒律，完全不为任何情况做出任何调整。	The Islamic State's spokesmen insist on following the original precepts laid down by the Prophet Mohammed and his earliest followers, understood literally and with no adjustment for different circumstances.
有力证据表明其潜在的危害程度远远大于食品污染物或杀虫剂残留物。 而在法律的制约下，后两者已经降到了很低的水平。	The strength of evidence and the potential magnitude of harm greatly exceed those of food contaminants or pesticide residues, which are appropriately regulated to very low levels.
比如，2月底，德国总理默克尔做出了令人惊讶的坚持：欧洲不需要加固其金融防火墙来保护其他欧元区国家免受希腊的无序违约。	At the end of February, for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a spectacle insisting that no bigger financial firewall was needed to protect other eurozone countries from a disorderly Greek default.
埃及的主要盟国美国差一点支持抗议群众，同时要求穆巴拉克政府在兑现“改善民主”承诺的同时，立即采取措施满足群众的合理要求。	The United States, Egypt’s main ally, while stopping short of siding with the protesters, is holding the regime to Mubarak’s promise of a “better democracy,” and demanding swift action to meet the people’s legitimate demands.
我们必须从个体和集体角度解决人工智能和生物技术等方面的尖端研究所带来的道德和伦理问题。 新科技将大大延长寿命，实现定制婴儿和记忆提取。	We must address, individually and collectively, moral and ethical issues raised by cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, which will enable significant life extension, designer babies, and memory extraction.
第一个是长期的不充分就业不仅伤害了目前也伤害了潜在的产出 — — 通过腐蚀失业人员的“人力资本 ” 。	First, prolonged unemployment destroys not just current but also potential output by eroding the “human capital” of the unemployed.
资源“从有直接用途的当年商品和服务上”如此大规模的“转移 ” ， 我指出 ， “ 只有在它能提振年度总体经济增长0.3%以上，或在25年时间里提振6 % ， 它才是划算的买卖 。 ”	Such a massive diversion of resources “away from goods and services directly useful this year,” I argued, “is a good bargain only if it boosts overall annual economic growth by 0.3% – or 6% per 25-year generation.”
但是，尽管在没有替代方案的情况下，这一脱钩可能持续一段时间，但金融市场表现和大部分人的福利之间的巨大差异不可能长期维持。	But, while this disconnect could continue for some time if no alternative program emerges, the huge gap between financial markets’ performance and most people’s well-being is unlikely to persist in the longer term.
更糟糕的是，大家知道就业的每一个方面都有这样那样的法律或规定，这种想法对工作岗位有害无益，使人无意尝试通过务实的方式解决问题。	Worse yet, the knowledge that some law or regulation covers every aspect of employment poisons the workplace and discourages attempts to resolve problems pragmatically.
近代早期的意大利纺织工人发觉他们的银币工资缩水了，而他们的产品仍然在国际奢侈品市场上保持坚挺的金币价格。	Early modern Italian textile workers would find their pay in silver reduced, while their products still commanded a gold price on the international market for luxuries.
虽然这个例子告诉我们军事政治领导人在袭击核反应堆前应当会三思后行，但仅仅是乌克兰核设施的庞大规模就需要全球更多的注意力。	While that case provides some assurance that military and political leaders will think twice about attacking nuclear reactors, the sheer scale of Ukraine’s nuclear enterprise calls for far greater global concern.
中国的高层人士很快从国际经验中认识到应对企业债务问题将会限制短期经济增长和增加社会成本 — — 例如失业。	Influential voices in China are quick to draw the lesson from international experience that tackling corporate debt can limit short-term growth and impose social costs, such as unemployment.
你也许认为乌克兰人对欧洲式民主理想的英勇决心会给他们带来大量西方支持，帮助他们抵抗俄罗斯的入侵和经济动荡。	One might have expected the heroic commitment of Ukrainians to Europe’s democratic ideals to trigger a rush of Western support for the country in its battle against Russian aggression and economic instability.
但那种更为细致精妙的政策制定 — — 通常基于企业可以被信任或引导去进行自我规管的错误假设 — — 已经失败了。	But more nuanced policymaking – often based on the misguided assumption that companies can be trusted, or induced, to self-regulate – has failed.
除非我们承认并解决这一现实，否则过去七十年来为世界带来了前所未有的和平与繁荣自由世界秩序将继续土崩瓦解。	Unless and until we recognize and address this reality, the liberal world order that has brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to the world over the past seven decades will continue to erode.
同样，雷诺汽车公司54%的股东，其中包括法国政府，在今年4月举行的企业年度股东大会上对CEO卡洛斯·戈恩2，500万欧元（合2，800万美元）的薪酬方案投了反对票。	Similarly, 54% of Renault SA’s shareholders, which include the French state, opposed CEO Carlos Ghosn’s €25 million ($28 million) remuneration package at the company’s AGM in April.
如果你将这些形象与打扮成体面的英国律师但充满了不安全感的年轻甘地的照片相比较，就会发现他深谙符号沟通之道。	If one compares those images with pictures of the young, insecure Gandhi dressed as a proper British lawyer, one can see how carefully he understood symbolic communication.
在穆加贝辞职后，中国外长不遗余力的赞扬“中国和津巴布韦之间的友谊 ” ， 而姆南加古瓦肯定会延续这样的关系。	Following Mugabe’s resignation, China’s foreign ministry went out of its way to praise the “friendship between China and Zimbabwe,” and Mnangagwa can be expected to continue that relationship.
典型的美国家庭知道现在的状况比四年前糟糕了许多，他们并不认为针对高收入群的减税政策真的带来了布什政府所预先承诺的好处。	The typical American family knows that it is worse off today than it was four years ago, and appears unconvinced that the tax cuts targeted at upper-income Americans brought the benefits heralded by the Bush administration.
菲格雷斯的食肉客驱逐计划像是一场运动，它是有害的，因为它表明这位联合国前气候主管眼中只有禁止自己不喜欢的行为，而其依据则是不堪一击的证据和夸大其词的报纸报道。	Like much campaigning, Figueres’s plan for meat-eaters is disturbing, because it suggests that the former UN climate chief is focused on banning behavior she doesn’t like, based on flimsy evidence and over-the-top newspaper reporting.
在我的第一次后1989年中国之旅中，一个酒吧间男服务员向我介绍了一个明确反映新的官方精神的习语 ： “ 没有运动，什么都可以 ” （ 只要没有政治运动，干什么都可以 ） 。	During my first post-1989 trip to China, a bartender introduced me to a phrase that perfectly characterized the new official mood: “Meiyou yundong, shenme dou keyi” (As long as there are no political movements, anything goes).
事实上，在美国这类资本充裕的国家，更多的进口（主要为劳动密集型产品）会提高资本回报率，从而推动国际资本流入该国。	And, indeed, in a more capital-abundant country like the United States, more imports (of mostly labor-intensive products) would raise the returns on capital, creating an incentive for international capital to flow to the country.
在这个快速变化的时代，教育和技能培训应当与贸易和产业等政策相协调，这样才能更有机会满足新兴的劳动力市场需求。	At a time of rapid change, education and skills training should be coordinated with, say, trade and industrial policies to improve the chances that emerging labor-market requirements will be met.
一场完美风暴正在外汇市场上形成。 这一风暴威胁到把欧元升值到令即使欧元区最为具有效率的国家德国无法在世界市场竞争的水平。	A perfect storm is forming in the foreign exchange markets that threatens to catapult the euro to levels that will make even the euro-zone’s most efficient exporter—Germany—unable to compete in world markets.
但这正是奥巴马的另一个非同寻常之处：他身份的复杂性使他具有真正的世界性，成为全球化时代的一位全球化候选人。	But that is another reason why Obama is exceptional: the complexity of his identity makes him truly universal, a global candidate for a global age.
心理学研究表明这三点当中的任何一点都可以很有说服力，而说服力的大小取决于演讲者的魅力以及听众自身的倾向性。	Psychological research has shown that any one of these three can be persuasive, depending on the speaker’s attractiveness or the audience’s predisposition.
但它们都不能不关注一个重要目标：制定一个新政策框架，这个框架要基于存在的共同利益，能够阻止关系的恶化、稳定欧洲-大西洋安全。	But none should distract attention from the important goal of identifying a new policy framework, based on existential common interests, that can stop the downward spiral in relations and stabilize Euro-Atlantic security.
最后，我们可以运动、共和国前进运动以及动力运动（Momentum，帮助科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn）改组英国工党平台的青年运动）都不是因为它们是“运动”而重要。	In the end, Podemos, La République En Marche!, and Momentum, the youth movement that helped Jeremy Corbyn reshape the British Labour Party’s platform, are not important because they are movements per se.
摩索尔是当今反叛力量的主要据点，伊拉克军队驻在那里的一位营长阿里说 ： “ 没有美国人，我们根本不可能控制伊拉克 。 ”	As Iraqi Colonel Omar Ali, the Iraqi battalion commander in Mosul, the main focus of the insurgency today, recently put it, “Without the Americans, it would be impossible for us to control Iraq.”
恰恰相反，这是法国耗时 15 年最终实现与北约和解 — — 以及欧洲防务所取得的实质性进展 — — 的产物。	Rather, it is the product of a 15-year process of rapprochement with NATO – and of the real progress being achieved in European defense.
逊尼派神职人员刚刚宣布要对“伊朗政权、真主党及其宗派盟军”开战圣战，这是穆斯林世界几百万人民的声音。	The Sunni clerics who have just declared a jihad against “the Iranian regime, Hezbollah, and its sectarian allies” are the voice of millions across the Muslim world.
在同意提高消费税的时候，反对派的自由民主党坚持要着手解决造成预算赤字的罪魁祸首 — — 日本退休人员的社会保障和福利开支。	In reaching the agreement to raise the consumption tax, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party insisted that the main squeeze on the budget deficit – the amount spent on social-security benefits for Japan’s retirees – begin to be addressed.
吸引市场人才加入中国庞大的官僚体系的一个关键点是政府高层需要鼓励下属果断独立的政策执行并容忍善意的决策失误，让有才干的官员在面对不确性而作出实时决定时不会有太大压力。	The key to attracting market-oriented talent to China’s large bureaucracy is to make it clear that risk-taking – and even failure – will be tolerated.
局部范围（有时候也出现大规模的）的冲击波，会引起海底斜坡上的海底沉淀物发生滑动倾泻，诸如大陆架斜坡上的海底沉淀物。	Locally, but sometimes still at a grand scale, the shock waves cause major sediment slides on steep underwater slopes such as those of the continental shelves.
从外部看，这里的公司散发着一种特权的味道 — — 比如在扩张进入全世界各大城市 — — 不管是柏林还是里约热内卢 — — 时藐视当地监管。	Viewed from outside, the world sees companies that exude a sense of entitlement – for example, by flouting local regulations as they expand into cities around the world, from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro.
斯瓦蒂·查图尔维迪（Swati Chaturvedi）在其2016年的自白书《我是一个“喷子 ” ： 印度人民党数字义勇军内幕 》 （ I Am A Troll: Inside the Secret World of the BJP’s Digital Army）中透露，印度人民党在印度国内外建立了许多报酬丰厚的水军，每人都操纵多个账号。	As Swati Chaturvedi explained in her 2016 exposé I Am A Troll: Inside the Secret World of the BJP’s Digital Army, cyber cells of well-paid trolls, each operating multiple accounts, have been established in India and abroad.
不幸的是，许多政府已经无力管理他们所释放的力量，而企业领导人也已丧失了责任感，不再关注为他们创造繁荣环境的社会福利制度。	Unfortunately, many governments had already lost the capacity to manage the forces they had unleashed, and business leaders had lost their sense of responsibility for the welfare of the societies within which they were flourishing.
布鲁塞尔—美国总统特朗普和中国国家主席习近平在刚刚结束的布宜诺斯艾利斯G20会议上达成暂时休战，双方都获得了一些时间思考问题之所在。	BRUSSELS – The temporary truce reached by US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the just-concluded G20 meeting in Buenos Aires should give both sides some time to reflect on the issues in question.
考虑到如此严重的危险，停止进一步核竞赛、消除全世界15,000发核武器存量所带来的风险符合所有国家的利益。	Given the grave dangers, it is in every country’s interest to halt further nuclear competition and eliminate the risks associated with the world’s remaining stockpiles of some 15,000 nuclear weapons.
每天，专家们都对伊拉克叛乱、玻利维亚古柯种植、欧洲央行和北朝鲜政治局等各种各样的问题发表高见，但我们对他们的意见到底应该相信多少？	Every day, experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European central bankers, and North Korea’s Politburo. But how much credibility should we attach to the opinions of experts?
事实上，尽管美国总统奥巴马显然渴望结束这一毫无意义的外交冻结，但一些右翼美国政客似乎宁可在佛罗里达州以南存在一个劣等国家而不是潜在伙伴。	Indeed, despite President Barack Obama’s apparent desire to end the pointless diplomatic freeze, some right-wing US politicians would, it seems, prefer a pariah to a potential partner off Florida’s coast.
他不是普通的美国总统，并且，借用《大西洋 》 （ The Atlantic）的塞伦娜·齐拓（Salena Zito）的话，必须认真对待特朗普，但不要从字面上理解他。	He is no ordinary US president, and he must be taken seriously, though not literally, to borrow a phrase from The Atlantic’s Salena Zito.
葛兰分子也因此可以将其玩弄于股掌之上 — — 比方说，保证军方有破坏力的泄密（其中最惊人的往往是捏造的）会在自由媒体首先发布。	And it allowed the Gülenists to play them – for example, by ensuring that damaging leaks from the military (the most egregious of which were fabricated) would be published in liberal outlets first.
类似地，欧元区在2008年金融危机后的恢复也受到严格财政规则的掣肘，这些规则规定成员国财政赤字水平不能超过GDP的3 % 。	Likewise, the eurozone’s recovery from the 2008 financial crisis has been held back by strict fiscal rules that limit member countries’ fiscal deficits to 3% of GDP.
但由军队占统治地位的政治系统排斥这类参与，因此随着经济不断增长，政治的去军队化成为所有大型军管穆斯林国家 — — 从印尼到地中海沿岸 — — 的群众呼声。	Military-dominated political systems precluded such participation, so, with economic growth, demilitarization of politics became a rallying cry in all large military-led Muslim states, from Indonesia to the Mediterranean coast.
在这方面，中国和沙特阿拉伯堪称杰出 — — 尽管它们绝不是“孤家寡人 ” — —组织了一系列日益厚颜无耻的绑架或让批评者失踪。	Here, China and Saudi Arabia stand out – though they are by no means alone – for orchestrating a series of increasingly brazen abductions or vanishings of their detractors.
为了更好地贯彻IMF双重宗旨的另外一半，IMF已经释出信号，表明它将增募资金，从2009年4月伦敦G20会议上通过的7500亿美元增加到1万亿美元。	In order to better carry out the other half of its dual mandate, the IMF has signaled that it will ask for a further increase in its resources, to $1 trillion, up from the $750 billion agreed at the London G-20 meeting in April 2009.
福格的策略被推广到东尼日利亚，然后又引入西非的其他地区，最终应用到最具挑战性的环境：拥有五亿人口的印度。	Foege’s strategy was extended to eastern Nigeria, then introduced to other parts of West Africa, and ultimately applied to the most challenging environment of all: India, with its half-billion people.
这个世界晚宴上最受青睐的演讲嘉宾包括右翼共和党人士德克萨斯前州长里克·佩里，佩里曾经把同性恋和酗酒相提并论。	Favored speakers at This World galas include the right-wing Republican former governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who once compared homosexuality to alcoholism.
在英国，扭转肥胖趋势可以让全国医保（National Health Service）每年节约约12亿美元。	In the UK, reversing obesity trends could save the National Health Service about $1.2 billion a year.
全世界只有不到一半的学龄难民儿童有学可上；有不到1/4的人能上到中学；不到1％的人可以继续接受高等教育。	Fewer than half of school-age refugee children worldwide attend school; not even one in four make it to secondary school; and under 1% go on to pursue a higher education.
正如伊曼纽尔·坎特（Immanuel Kant）在很久之前所指出的那样，实行民主制度的国家一般都不愿互相攻伐，因此应该推动民主以实现和平。	Because, as Immanuel Kant noted long ago, states with democratic political systems tend not to fight with each other, democracy should be encouraged in order to secure peace.
而他们对此的回应则涵盖对指标测量方式，劳动力市场结构转变，潜在性的投资机会缺乏，稀释生产率的技术创新以及技术导致的技能错配等问题。	Their response covers concerns about measurement, structural shifts in the labor market, a potential paucity of investment opportunities, productivity-diluting technological innovations, and technology-driven skills mismatches.
和许多学界和发展界人士一样，我也是全球化的最大受益者之一 — — 我们能够将我们的服务在比我们的父辈所能想象的更大更富有的市场上出售。	Like many in academia and in the development industry, I am among globalization’s greatest beneficiaries – those who are able to sell our services in markets that are larger and richer than our parents could have dreamed of.
鉴于美国财政赤字庞大，中国正在推行宽松财政和信贷政策，欧洲仍处于复苏之路，当前的全球扩张势头可能会持续到明年。	The current global expansion will likely continue into next year, given that the US is running large fiscal deficits, China is pursuing loose fiscal and credit policies, and Europe remains on a recovery path.
"40美元一桶的油价预计会使全球潜在产出的长期年增长率降低近01 . % ，而60美元一桶的油价将会""可衡量的""全球潜在产出长期年增长率降低近0.3 % 。"	"At $40 a barrel, expect oil prices to slow the long-run growth rate of the world's potential output by 0.1% per year. At $60 a barrel, expect the ""measured"" long-term rate of potential world output growth to slow by roughly 0.3% per year."
过去20年来，土耳其取得了令人瞩目的经济成就，从欧洲病夫一跃成为欧洲最具活力的经济体之一和新的中东贸易中心区。	Over the past two decades, Turkey has made remarkable economic strides, transforming itself from Europe’s sick man into one of its most vibrant economies and a new center of gravity for trade in the Middle East.
这也许还没有到达欧洲央行“低于但接近2 % ” 的目标，但显然无法论证欧洲央行日益激进地动用货币工具刺激经济。	This may fall short of the European Central Bank’s target of “below but close to 2%,” but not by a margin substantial enough to justify the ECB’s increasingly aggressive use of monetary instruments to stimulate the economy.
"对""叶利钦式民主""的失望推动普京总统寻找以民族主义和国家荣誉为基础的全新意识形态，这被普京称为""管理下的多元论 。 """	"Disillusion with ""democracy Boris Yeltsin-style"" has pushed President Vladimir Putin to search for an ideology based on nationalism and the glorification of the state. Putin calls it ""managed pluralism."""
尽管这些政策或有助于价格稳定，但他的方案忽略了巴西央行问题最重要的两个方面：法律自主权和保证公民问责权的制度改革。	While such policies may promote price stability, his proposal neglects the two most important issues for the BCB: legal autonomy and institutional reforms that ensure accountability to citizens.
六四危机，通过团结党领导层的重新团结以及党和城市人民之间的团结的重新建立，巩固了中国共产党的统治，并加速了目前这一轮中国经济高速发展的势头。	By reunifying the Party leadership and re-establishing solidarity between the Party and the urban population, the crisis consolidated CCP rule, and accelerated China’s momentum down its current path of rapid economic growth.
以色列的袭击获得了开门红，而哈马斯也因成功地用导弹袭击了特拉维夫感到欢欣鼓舞，这一成就让真主党在2006年黎巴嫩战争中的成果相形见绌。	Israel’s assault scored impressive initial successes, while Hamas can take pride in having reached Tel Aviv with its missiles, an achievement that eluded Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon War.
有鉴于此，阿拉伯的国家主义政府们认为抗拒严肃的政治改革是完全必要的，而压制国内的反对派，特别是日长夜大的伊斯兰主义运动也是合情合理的。	As a result, Arab nationalist governments feel justified in resisting serious political reform and vindicated in repressing all domestic opposition, particularly the swelling Islamist movements.
监管也好，分业经营也好，大部分银行业改革方案仍然停留在纸上作业阶段，金融游说集团一定会竭尽所能削弱它们的功效。	Whether relying on regulation, or gesturing towards institutional separation, most proposals for banking reform remain at the drawing-board stage, and are sure to be emasculated by financial lobbies.
伊斯兰国信奉原教旨主义的瓦哈比派思想，他们极度嗜血，目标是回归想象中的前现代哈里发帝国，征服什叶派并将非穆斯林打为二等公民。	Powered by a fundamentalist Wahhabi ideology and a boundless appetite for bloodshed, the Islamic State seeks a return to an imagined pre-modern caliphate that subjugates Shia and treats non-Muslims as second-class citizens.
他们还可能合理地得出结论，他未能将其部分福克斯新闻台的薪金导入401(K)账户，是针对他所述语言的极为有力的论证。	And they might reasonably conclude that his failure to channel some of his Fox News salary into a 401(k) account is a very powerful argument against the words coming out of his mouth.
如果该党能获得45%以上的国内选票，那么依据土耳其选举法的奇怪规定，就能在550个议会席位中拥有代表超过330个。	If the party is able to secure more than 45% of the national vote, the quirks in Turkey’s electoral law will give it more than 330 representatives in the country’s 550-seat legislature.
只有合作能带来和平，摆脱无用、危险、终将破产的新军备竞赛 — — 这次包括网络武器、空间武器和下一代核武器。	Only cooperation can deliver peace and the escape from a useless, dangerous, and ultimately bankrupting new arms race, this time including cyber-weapons, space weapons, and next-generation nuclear weapons.
但是，如果阿根廷获得足够投资建设让瓦卡穆尔塔页岩资源盈利所需要的基础设施 — — 管道、铁路、石英矿和废物站 — — 阿根廷有可能会因为充分开采而受困。	Yet, if Argentina receives sufficient investment to build the infrastructure – the pipelines, railways, silica mines, and waste sites – needed to make Vaca Muerta profitable, the country may become effectively locked into full exploitation.
我们观察到，大部分涉及到的机构 — — 贝尔斯登（Bear Stearns ） 、 雷曼兄弟（Lehman Brothers ） 、 房利美以及GSE房贷美（Freddie Mac ） 、 AIG、华盛顿互惠银行（MaWu）和美联银行（Wachovia ） — —都没有被格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案所覆盖，这让人怀疑它的向心性。	The observation that most of the institutions involved – Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae, the GSE Freddie Mac, AIG, WaMu, and Wachovia – were not covered by Glass-Steagall calls into question its centrality.
我们相信只要激励措施得当，基础设施对那些拥有长期负债的机构而言完全可以成为创新且有吸引力的资产类别。	We believe that with the right incentives, infrastructure can be an innovative and attractive asset class for those with long-term liabilities.
最为重要的是，对预先宣告的争议表明在欧洲央行的管理委员会中，迫切需要一致精神和权力分享精神的重新兴起。	More than anything, the pre-announcement controversy demonstrates that a renewed spirit of consensus and collegiality in the ECB’s Governing Council is sorely needed.
不幸的是，变异型克雅氏病在加拿大、法国、爱尔兰、意大利、日本、荷兰、葡萄牙、沙特阿拉伯和美国的发病率也逐年上升。	This unfortunately has been accompanied by increasing number of variant CJD cases in Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and the USA.
这些观点认为，对经济大萧条和二战后年代中的工业化经济体而言，这些养老金体制是不错的，但是，在当今高科技、网络化以及后工业化经济体中，他们已经落伍了。	These programs were fine, the argument goes, for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the post-World War II generation, but they have become obsolete in today’s high-tech, networked, post-industrial economy.
不仅如此，真正意义上的技术执政将建立一支有官僚管理经验的健全的公务员队伍，利用大数据来衡量和优化福利政策。	Moreover, a real technocracy would boast a robust civil service trained in bureaucratic management techniques that use data to measure and optimize welfare.
如果那是我们想要的未来，我们应该意识清醒地向这一目标大踏步前进。 我们不能漫无目的地乱逛直到落入陷阱，之后才抬起头来，迷迷糊糊地不知道怎么会这样。	If that is the future we want, we should stride toward it with full awareness and a sense of purpose, not meander carelessly until we fall into a hole, look up, and wonder how we got there.
无奈事与愿违，不但冒出了一个悬浮议会（英国政治术语，意指在英国下议院选举中无任何政党赢得总共650个席位中的半数以上 ） , 还可能导致今年晚些时候再来一场大选。	It ended up doing the opposite, producing a hung parliament and the likelihood of another general election later in the year.
像壳牌的专家一样，埃克森公司的科学家预测海平面将破坏性上升，并警告美国中西部和世界其他地区可能会变为沙漠。	Like Shell’s experts, Exxon’s scientists predicted devastating sea-level rise, and warned that the American Midwest and other parts of the world could become desert-like.
但是，尽管这两个条件在9月初都已实现，FOMC仍决定保持利率不变，给出的解释是其担忧全球经济环境，特别是中国的情况。	But, although both conditions were met earlier in September, the FOMC decided to leave the rate unchanged, explaining that it was concerned about global economic conditions and about events in China in particular.
上述理念同样无法承受不被民众理解、国内政客也不愿承担责任的规章和行动所招致的对欧盟机构的不可避免的攻击。	Nor can it withstand the inevitable attacks directed against EU institutions for every action and regulation that citizens dislike and for which national politicians want to avoid responsibility.
在欧洲，危机的根源来自于一个单一政治联盟的缺位，因为这是分担债务并以此将欧元构筑在一个合理基础之上的必要前提。	In Europe, the absence of a political union – considered a necessary precondition for sharing debt obligations and, thus, putting the euro on a sound footing – is widely held to lie at the root of the continent’s crisis.
尽管这一方案明确了日本利用欧战并且在欧洲各国在东南亚取得立足点的愿望，但是它并未明确说明谁是日本的真正敌人。	Although it made clear Japan’s desire to take advantage of the European conflict and gain a foothold in the European colonies in Southeast Asia, the plan was not clear about who constituted Japan’s true enemy.
一项研究表明，在20世纪独立国家的1 941名执政者中，只有27名女性，其中还有一半是以男性执政者的遗孀或女儿身份问鼎权力的。	One study of the 1,941 rulers of independent countries during the twentieth century found only 27 women, roughly half of whom came to power as widows or daughters of a male ruler.
但大多数这类政策 — — 可能银行联盟除外 — — 都旨在应对违约风险，而非铲除导致这一风险的根源。	But most of these policies – with the possible exception of the banking union – are aimed at managing default risk, not eliminating this risk’s root causes.
第二个阻力是，对西方来说，最有利的做法是袖手旁观，同时利用制裁和节节下跌的油价拖垮俄罗斯经济，最终打败普京本人。	The second objection is that the West would be best served by simply standing back and watching while sanctions and plunging oil prices bring down Russia’s economy – and ultimately Putin himself.
与此相反，各国政府却奋力延长这些不可持续的繁荣，从而进一步推高商品价格，并且增加了那种“千载难逢”的经济和金融混乱的风险。	Instead, governments are clawing to stretch out unsustainable booms, further pushing up commodity prices, and raising the risk of a once-in-a-lifetime economic and financial mess.
在意大利，民族主义的联盟党（League）与民粹主义的五星运动（Five Star Movement）组成执政联盟发号施令。	In Italy, the nationalist League party appears to be calling the shots in its new governing coalition with the populist Five Star Movement.
基于歪曲伊斯兰教义的极端主义仍在不断膨胀；事实上，只有靠宗教的方式（加上相应安全措施）才能遏制它的滋长。	Extremism based on a perversion of Islam shows no sign of abating; indeed, it will not abate until it is taken on religiously, as well as by security measures.
但制造健康还需要相关人等开展“投资合作”��—也就是让他们努力提升自己的“健康生产率 ” ， 就像企业需要激励员工提高生产率一样。	But producing health also requires “co-investment” by the people involved – that is, getting them to exert themselves to increase their “health productivity,” just as a company needs to motivate its workers to increase productivity.
匈牙利即将执掌欧盟大权，而对该国总理维克托·奥尔班篡改宪法镇压媒体的讨论却日趋激烈，同时还夹杂着人们对该国金融稳定性的再度忧虑。	Hungary’s turn at the EU helm comes at a time of fierce debate over Prime Minister Victor Orbán’s alteration of constitutional law and suppression of press freedom, as well as a new round of worries about the country’s financial sustainability.
它们是为国内不平��所困扰的正在崛起的力量，不停地向民族主义的方向发展、向处于主导地位的力量发起挑战，最终引发逆转经济全球化进展的世界战争。	A rising power, beset with internal inequality, turns to nationalism and challenges the dominant power, provoking a war that turns back the progress of economic globalization.
最近我们从新德里的一家制衣厂中营救了一批孩子，在过去三年多的时间中他们被迫待在一个不通风的地下室里每天工作20个小时。	Recently, we rescued children from a garment factory in New Delhi, where, for more than three years, they had been forced to sit and work for 20 hours a day in a basement with no ventilation.
2010年危机爆发（即希腊和其他国家的财政问题引发金融市场焦虑）前，有些经济学家纷纷猜测欧元很可能迅速取代美元而成为世界主要储备货币。	Until the crisis of 2010, when fiscal problems in Greece and elsewhere created anxiety in financial markets, some economists had speculated that the euro might soon replace the dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency.
在美国境内，过去三年就业人口从2007年的1.378亿人轻微下降到2010年7月的1.3亿人，减少了790万人 — — 要知道这段时间内人口还增长了600万。	In the United States, the past three years have seen employment fall from 137.8 million people in July 2007 to slightly less than 130 million in July 2010 – a decline of 7.9 million during a period in which the adult population grew by six million.
但有一点是显而易见的，国家（state）具有超越民族重点问题（national priority）的共同利益。	Yet one is obvious: States possess common interests that should trump national priorities.
长期方案，比如建立和连通生化检测系统等，应该予以扩大和强化，让全世界公共卫生专业人员能够追踪和报告人类和动物疫情，共同规划防御方案。	And long-term solutions such as establishing and connecting bio-surveillance systems should be expanded and strengthened, to enable public-health professionals around the world to track and report human and animal diseases and plan defenses together.
他们更有可能在动用在叙利亚的权力保护自己，或者在权力被削弱的情况下逃往莫斯科或德黑兰，阻挠对他们的抓捕行动。	They are more likely to use their power in Syria to shield themselves and, if weakened, flee to Moscow or Tehran, delaying efforts to apprehend them.
而欧盟也自顾不暇，因为它们既头痛于如何处理竞争力下降的问题，又为如何支付那些人们自以为应得的福利而苦恼。	Europeans continue to look inward, obsessed with their own problems of declining competitiveness and how to pay for entitlements that they have come to regard as theirs by right.
只有一样东西能阻止决心为ISIS而死的自杀青年：将他引向正确道路、让他相信神创造我们是为了改善而不是摧毁世界的更强大的意识形态。	Only one thing can stop a suicidal youth who is ready to die for ISIS: a stronger ideology that guides him onto the right path and convinces him that God created us to improve our world, not to destroy it.
管理层和董事会成员常常获得股权补偿，这不但使他们获得了权益，反过来又创造了一个使公司股票市场价值最大化的强大诱因。	Managers and board members often receive stock-based compensation, which gives them equity ownership rights and, in turn, creates a powerful incentive to maximize the market value of their companies’ shares.
处于同一状态的保守党政客如果了解一下已经导致了3,600多起暴力死亡的“爱尔兰问题 ” ， 将大有裨益。	Conservative politicians who find themselves in such a position would do well to know that conflicts over the “Irish question” have resulted in more than 3,600 violent deaths.
可虽然特朗普在竞选时走的是民粹主义，他的统治手段却是财阀式的，最近的例子就是他为大多数共和党人仍然坚信的那种极不可靠的供给侧税收理论背书。	But while Trump ran as a populist, he has governed as a plutocrat, most recently by endorsing the discredited supply-side theory of taxation that most Republicans still cling to.
当然，上海国际能源交易所按交易量计算仍落后于在伦敦交易的布伦特原油合约以及在纽约交易的西德克萨斯中质原油期货合同。	Of course the volume of trades on the Shanghai INE still lags behind that of the Brent oil contracts traded in London and the West Texas Intermediate oil futures traded in New York.
当越战败局已定时，美国的重点从该地区离开，让胜利者来收拾残局 — — 并最终加入东盟安全与合作格局。	When its defeat became apparent in Vietnam, the US pivoted away from the region, leaving the victor to clean up the mess – and, ultimately, to join the ASEAN structure of security and cooperation.
在捷克、匈牙利和波兰，在最后日期前完成如此艰难的改革任务，对社会主义政党来说，意味着他们不得不背叛他们在左翼选民眼里的社会主义者身份。	"In the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, the task of completing such difficult reforms just before crossing the ""finish line"" fell to socialist parties, forcing them to betray their socialist identity in the eyes of leftist voters."
但该过程导致其双轨经济在效益方面的裂变，国有企业表现明显劣于民营企业，尽管前者比后者更容易获得信贷。	But the process has created significant discrepancies in economic performance, with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) performing significantly worse than their private-sector counterparts, despite having better access to credit.
但是，除了美国可能例外，大部分发达经济体的增长仍将十分疲软，新兴市场的脆弱性 — — 包括中国在经济再平衡方面的措施不够确定 — — 可能将拖累新一年的全球增长。	But, with the possible exception of the US, growth will remain anemic in most advanced economies, and emerging-market fragility – including China’s uncertain efforts at economic rebalancing – could become a drag on global growth in subsequent years.
伦敦 – 2017年2月，我写了一则乐观的评论，题目是《令人惊喜的全球经济恢复力 》 （ The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience ） 。	LONDON – In February 2017, I wrote an optimistic commentary called “The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience.”
并且，抛去程度问题不谈，俄罗斯也绝不是唯一一个在举办奥运会、一级方程式锦标赛（今年晚些时候也将在索契进行）和世界杯足球赛期间横生贪污腐败的国家。	And, the grand scale aside, Russia is hardly the only country where Olympic sports, Formula One racing (also to take place later this year in Sochi), or World Cup soccer is a boon for larceny and graft.
但随后不久，货币紧缩让经济增长回到了减速轨道，促使政府放松政策并在2011年年底、2012年年引入了微型刺激计划。	Soon after, however, monetary tightening put economic growth back on a downward trajectory, spurring the government to loosen policy and introduce mini-stimulus packages in late 2011 and early 2012.
中国决策层就像是在下围棋，需要将国家的关键棋子 — — 即国有企业商业模式的改变 — — 在正确的时间落在正确的地方，而且棋子与棋子之间还要互相协调。	As in a game of Go, China’s leaders need to move the country’s pieces – that is to say, effect change in the SOEs’ business models – in the right place, at the right time, and in a coordinated fashion.
而如今他们却又面对着尖锐的职责，正如意大利中央银行行长马里奥·德拉齐指出的那样，许多国家央行的独立性都受到了极大挑战，特别是欧元区内的那几家。	Today, however, central banks are being sharply criticized, and their independence is coming under severe pressure in many countries, particularly in the eurozone, as Mario Draghi, the head of the Bank of Italy, recently pointed out.
将投资税收优惠扩大到德国企业也许更能刺激支出，但这样做在一个劳动力占国民收入比重已经处于下降趋势的国家存在政治问题。	Extending investment tax credits to German firms might be more effective in boosting spending, but doing so would be politically problematic in a country where labor’s share of national income is already declining.
金融包容性对实现包容性经济增长和性别平等至关重要，而且随着世界银行旨在到2020年实现全面金融覆盖，其在全球发展工作中已经发挥了显著的作用。	Financial inclusion is vital for inclusive economic growth and gender equality, and it has assumed a prominent role in global development efforts, with the World Bank aiming for universal financial inclusion by 2020.
作为回应，温家宝总理在全国人大会议期间公布了一系列措施，从在未来五年逐渐减免农业税到旨在增加农民收入的举措。	In response, Premier Wen Jiabao announced a series of measures during the NPC, ranging from phasing out agricultural taxes over the next five years to measures aimed at increasing farmers' income.
比如，近代欧洲流行一种观点，那就是如果一个女人婚前有过性行为，她就可能把爱人的印记留在自己体内，如果她婚后生子，小孩就可能会更像她从前的恋人，而不像现在的丈夫。	For example, pre-modern Europe believed that a woman who had sex before marriage might carry the imprint of her lover within her, so that her child born in wedlock would resemble the earlier lover, rather than the husband.
近年来，朝鲜在全球范围内发起了大量网络攻击，其中最著名的一次是针对索尼影业，此外还针对许多金融机构。	In recent years, North Korea has launched numerous cyber attacks around the world, most notably against Sony Pictures, but also against many financial institutions.
这就解释了为什么Skillful正在利用行业和地理数据来协助劳动者发掘本身已经具备的符合市场需要的技能、锁定他们可能想从事的职业，以及可以追求进一步职业发展或新职位的场合。	That is why Skillful is leveraging industry and geographical data to help workers discover marketable skills they already have, careers they might want, and places where they can pursue further professional development or new employment.
当时所做出的政治决策远比在巴尔干地区做出的决策风险更大，而希腊和伊比利亚的成功故事充分表明了当时所做出的勇敢决定的睿智。	Political decisions taken then were far more risky than those at hand in the Balkans, and the Greek and Iberian success stories demonstrate the wisdom of the courageous decisions taken at that time.
但有一个国家可以帮助全世界实现急需的透明度 — — 并具有四两拨千斤的影响力，那就是中国，因为朝鲜和伊朗两国的核关系必须通过中国才能实现。	One country could help the world gain the transparency – and the leverage – that it needs: China, over whose territory Iran and North Korea must be conducting their nuclear relations.
这种状况也推动食品价格上涨，迄今为止至少令3000万贫困人口陷入饥饿，到2020年预计还有4千到1亿3千万人会加入饥饿大军。	It also drives up food prices, which so far has pushed at least 30 million poor people into starvation, with another 40-130 million expected to be starving by 2020.
但是，在制定具体政策的时候必须慎之又慎，历史上，意在降低商品价格波动性的措施最后反而助长波动的例子数不胜数。	But adverse movements in the terms of trade must be accommodated; they cannot be fought with monetary policy.
此外还有库尔德人尚未得偿所愿的建国野心（他们中有大量生活在土耳其、斯拉克、叙利亚和伊朗）以及如何调和以色列的现实和巴勒斯坦人的政治目标这一悬而未决的问题。	There are also the unfulfilled national aspirations of the Kurds (large numbers of whom live in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran) and the unresolved matter of how to reconcile the reality of Israel with the Palestinians’ political goals.
在某些地区 — — 包括埃及南部、黎巴嫩山区和安纳托利亚（Anatolia）东南部 — — 基督徒更是占据绝对多数。	In certain areas – including southern Egypt, the mountains of Lebanon, and southeastern Anatolia – they formed an absolute majority.
“软实力 ” — —通过吸引和劝说而非强制和收买来影响他人的能力 — — 有时被用来形容任何不涉及武力的权力行使 — — 但这是错误的。	The term “soft power” – the ability to affect others by attraction and persuasion rather than the hard power of coercion and payment – is sometimes used to describe any exercise of power that does not involve the use of force.
最近，全球保护主义的兴起让这一困境变得更加糟糕，一个明证是富士康公司（苹果公司的主要供应商）决定在华盛顿投资100亿美元建设新工厂。	Recently, the rise in global protectionism has made this difficult situation worse, as epitomized by the decision of Foxconn (a major supplier to Apple) to invest $10 billion in a new factory in Wisconsin.
他必须从现在 — — 即第一次出访北约、出席G7峰会开始。 在出访的前几站，即沙特阿拉伯和以色列，他已经表现出略微朝这个方向转变的迹象。	Trump’s presence at the NATO and G7 summits, in particular, has created more uncertainty, underscored by German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s statement that, “The times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over.”
因此，去年12月，我寻求引入修正刑法典第377条并让一切成年人之间的性行为（不论性别和取向）脱罪的法案。	So, last December, I sought to introduce a bill that would have amended Section 377 and decriminalized all consensual sex between adults, irrespective of their gender and sexuality.
当时，所有人都认为已经给了和平足够的机会。 （没有给和平足够的机会，这正是为什么号召在外交努力已被认为无法取得任何成果时时马上结束通常是错误的。	No one at the time tried to argue that peace was not given a chance, which is why advocating a quick end to diplomacy when it is judged unlikely to achieve anything is often a mistake.
然而在此之后美国经济鸿沟却日益拉宽，对那些没有受过大学教育的人产生了毁灭性的影响，而该群体里包含了近3/4的非裔美国人。	And yet the economic divide in the US has grown much wider, with devastating effects on those without a college education, a group that includes almost three-quarters of African-Americans.
此外，通过任命性别平衡的内阁，领导者正在有意识地面对女性在政治领域的某种共同经历：那就是，女性在数量上远低于她们的男性同僚。	Moreover, by appointing gender-balanced cabinets, leaders are intentionally addressing a common experience for women in politics: being vastly outnumbered by male counterparts.
坎布里奇—约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz ） 、 罗杰·法尔莫（Roger Farmer）和我现在是、并且早就已经在什么才是最重要的要点方面达成了一致。	CAMBRIDGE – Joseph Stiglitz, Roger Farmer, and I are now and have long been in agreement on what are probably the most important points.
印度空间研究组织（ISRO）的科学家们自信从这一教训中汲取了宝贵的经验，但Chandrayaan任务的局部失败仍使他们挥之不去的阴影。	While scientists at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) believe that they gained valuable lessons from the experience, the partial failure of the Chandrayaan mission still haunts them.
但他们的观点被西尼尔（Nassau Senior）反对，他认为就连食品救济都不应该有：尽管数百万人因爱尔兰土豆饥荒丧命，但“这远远不够 。 ”	But they were balanced by those like Nassau Senior, who spoke out against even famine relief: Although a million people would die in the Irish Potato Famine, “that would scarcely be enough.”
这不仅缩短了它们的通讯时间；也改善了能源效率，幅度可达5,000倍 — — 有望产生能源效率接近生物脑的计算机。	This not only reduces the time they take to communicate; it improves energy efficiency by a factor of as much as 5,000 – potentially providing computers with efficiency close to that of a biological brain.
为了将生物医学工程应用于难民健康挑战，学生，专家和从业者需要去熟悉难民定居点的条件，并加深对困难难民所受复杂创伤的理解。	To apply biomedical engineering to refugee health challenges, students, experts, and practitioners need to familiarize themselves with conditions in refugee settlements, and deepen their understanding of the complex traumas that afflict refugees.
沙特阿拉伯支持与巴林街头示威者的和平谈判，也向巴林提供了大量经济援助用于改善生活，但我们永远不会接受伊朗对巴林的吞并。	Saudi Arabia has supported peaceful negotiations with street protesters in Bahrain, and has provided the country with considerable economic aid to improve life there, but we will never accept an Iranian takeover.
在更宏观方面，特朗普声称世界贸易组织（WTO）已经失能 — — 例如对中国而言 — — 而美国应该退出该组织。	More broadly, Trump argues that the World Trade Organization has failed – for example, with regard to China – and that the United States should withdraw from the organization.
而在大选中遭到对手暗算的两位总统候选人 — — 也都是当年的老革命 — — 则本能地把眼前的局面视为一次历史的重演。	The cheated presidential candidates, both veterans of the revolution, instinctively thought of a replay of history.
战斗加剧了地区不稳定局势；美国和欧洲公民正涌入叙利亚参加圣战；而且一战后中东边界正在解体的看法也越来越被人们所接受。	The fighting has heightened instability in the region; US and European citizens are streaming into Syria to take up jihad; and there is a growing consensus that the post-World War I Middle East boundaries are coming undone.
失业大军中不仅包括建筑工人，还包括水暖工和电工等房地产附属工种，以及房地产中介和银行职员等辅助性行业。	The unemployed comprise not only construction workers, but also ancillary workers, such as real-estate brokers and bankers, as well as all those who work on houses, such as plumbers and electricians.
只有欧洲央行承担起最终贷款人的角色，才能制止欧元区资本外流，并恢复人们对欧洲解决自身问题能力的信心。	Only the ECB, by taking on the role of lender of last resort, can stop the eurozone’s capital outflow and restore confidence in Europe’s capacity to solve its own problems.
对此法国历史学家和社会学家伊曼努尔·托德（Emmanuel Todd）认为，无论在世界哪个地方，经济腾飞通常都会在一国50%以上民众脱离文盲后的60~70年后实现。	The French historian and sociologist Emmanuel Todd has argued that, everywhere in the world, economic takeoff usually occurs 60-70 years after 50% of the population achieves literacy.
纽约—伊斯坦布尔、达卡和巴格达的致命恐怖袭击表明伊斯兰国（ISIS）的魔爪已经触及欧洲、北非、中东和亚洲多部。	NEW YORK – Deadly terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Dhaka, and Baghdad demonstrate the murderous reach of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.
我们怎能肯定它们不会“泄露”并感染更大范围的系统，或者被转作其他用途，再或者未来的无赖国家或恐怖分子不会利用它们反过来攻击它们的创造者？	How can we be sure that they won’t “escape” and infect a much broader class of systems, or be adopted for other uses, or that future rogue states or terrorists won’t find a way to turn them on their creators?
如果政府果真更为积极，那么为什么我们没有见到对其他争议，例如盗取农田、投资者权利受损或者高层腐败等的类似的反应呢？	If the government were truly becoming more responsive, why have we not seen similar responses to other disputes over the theft of farmland, compromised investors’ rights, or high-level corruption?
研究显示，非矿物燃料能源资源 — — 依据目前的可应用性 — — 在帮助我们在2050年保持一个稳定的碳排放量方面也只能解决不到一半的需要，而在达成2100年目标方面也只能是杯水车薪。	Research shows that non-fossil fuel energy sources will – based on today’s availability – get us less than halfway toward a path of stable carbon emissions by 2050, and only a tiny fraction of the way towards stabilization by 2100.
这意味着不仅要承认卡扎菲政策及当前问题间有着重要的联系，而且还要确保不会在抹去卡扎菲记忆的仓促浪潮中牺牲本应被保留的东西。	That means not only recognizing the vital link between his policies and today’s problems, but also ensuring that what should be preserved is not sacrificed in the rush to efface his memory.
问题不在于政府和央行无法重塑就业，或不知道如何重塑就业；而在于政府和央行不会采取规模足够大的扩张性政策步骤来迅速重塑充分就业。	The issue is not that governments and central banks cannot restore employment, or do not know how; it is that governments and central banks will not take expansionary policy steps on a large enough scale to restore full employment rapidly.
欧盟各成员国在一些敏感的政治议题，例如税收，健康教育，养老金，就业市场以及外交政策等方面，都有自己的决定权。	The EU’s member states retain power over the most sensitive political issues, including taxes, health, education, pensions, the labor market, and foreign policy.
首先也是最重要的，奥巴马必须在国会的支持下要求披露所有与美国国家安全机构和美国IT企业间互动有关的信息。	First and foremost, Obama, with support from Congress, must demand the release of all information regarding interactions between national security agencies and American IT firms.
但这一委员会能给默克尔带来额外的政治收益 — — 它可以限制她的副总理兼财政部长、社会民主党的欧拉夫·舒尔茨（Olaf Scholz）的影响力。	Yes, such a committee would bring Merkel the added political benefit of constraining the influence of Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, her Vice-Chancellor and finance minister.
而那些粗鲁些的英国退欧主义者则明确表示他们要让不加管制就会遍布英国各地的强奸犯、罪犯和拼命生小孩的外国人（尤其是土耳其人）进不了英国。	And the cruder Brexiteers were explicit that they would deny entry to the rapists, criminals, and fast-breeding foreigners (Turks in particular) who would otherwise flood the land.
一些国家重启了资本账户流入管制，如对购买本国债券、股票和衍生品的外国投资者征税、对短期资本流实施储备金要求等。	Some resorted to capital-account regulations on inflows, such as taxes on the foreign purchases of bonds, equities, and derivatives, reserve requirements on short-term inflows, and so forth.
假设确是如此 — — 许多这些地区的决策者都倾向如此 — — 耶伦对美国银行系统“大大增强”的担保也将适用于发达世界的其他所有具系统重要性的银行管理辖区。	Assuming that it does, as policymakers there intend, Yellen’s assurance of a “much stronger” banking system in the US will apply to all of the other systemically important banking jurisdictions in the developed world, too.
因为真正的大新闻是上月英国、德国，法国和意大利与其他30多个国家一同成为亚洲基础设施投资银行（亚投行）的创始国。	Indeed, that news was made last month, when the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy joined more than 30 other countries as founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
基于实用主义政治考虑（比如利比亚-意大利关系）或裙带主义的大资金分配应该被重新评估，并要以更好更强的治理实践作为标准。	Large allocations based on pragmatic political concerns, such as Libya-Italy relations, or cronyism should be reevaluated in the light of better and stronger governance practices.
AGOA包含一个日落条款，但是，如果正如在香港世贸会议规定的那样将针对非洲欠发达国家而言免税准入永久化，那么亚洲穷国将继续失去美国的市场份额。	AGOA had a sunset clause, but if the duty-free access becomes permanent for less developed countries in Africa – as stipulated in Hong Kong – then poor countries in Asia will continue to lose US market share.
认为更少的人活得更长更好的一个原因是，只有被生出来的人才知道剥夺生命意味着什么；本不存在的人不会知道他们失去了什么。	One reason for thinking it better to have fewer people living longer lives is that only those who are born know what death deprives them of; those who do not exist cannot know what they are missing.
在过去一周里，安倍为自己创造很大的以战略合作伙伴身份施展的政治空间 — — 不仅是对印度，也包括日本的其他盟国，特别是美国。	In the past week, Abe created for himself considerably more political space to act as a strategic partner, not only to India, but also to Japan’s other allies, particularly the United States.
比如说，伏马菌素（fumonisin）以及其他真菌都拥有极强毒性，不但会使人类罹患食道癌，还能令其他食用玉米的牲畜患上致命性疾病。	For example, fumonisin and some other fungal toxins are highly toxic, causing esophageal cancer in humans and fatal diseases in livestock that eat infected corn.
如果说失业率并没有维持在“大萧条”时期的水平，但也高得足以使长期失业或对长期失业的恐惧成为一种刻骨铭心的经历。	If unemployment was not stuck quite at Great Depression levels, it remained high enough to make long-term joblessness or the fear of long-term joblessness a defining experience.
最近的事件进一步削弱了俄罗斯国内亲西方的市场派，强化了国家资本主义和民族主义派，后两者正在试图加快欧亚联盟的建立。	Recent events have further weakened market-oriented, Western-leaning factions in Russia and strengthened the state-capitalist, nationalist factions, who are now pushing for faster establishment of the EAU.
此外，人均欧盟生产率 — — 在1995年之前的20年中，欧洲的这一指标一直在向美国靠拢，到1995年时只比美国低5 % — —在欧元区危机前的十年中相对美国下降了10个百分点。	Furthermore, per capita EU productivity, which had been converging on the US level for 20 years up to 1995, when Europe was only about 5% below the US, lost ten percentage points in relative terms in the decade preceding the eurozone crisis.
在19世纪晚期诸如“牛肉、肱二头肌和薄伽梵歌”等口号的激励下，国民志愿团模仿欧洲法西斯向身着卡其色的军服的印度教年轻人灌输他们自己的军事纪律理想。	Inspired by late-nineteenth-century slogans such as “Beef, Biceps, and the Bhagavad Gita,” the RSS emulated European fascists by instilling their own ideals of military discipline in young Hindus in khaki uniforms.
事实上，我们的一次性经济的后果 — — 如二氧化碳排放量的高企、难以管理的废品潮和越来越难以提取资源等 — — 已经显露无疑。	Indeed, the consequences of our disposable economy – skyrocketing CO2 emissions, unmanageable waste streams, and the increasing difficulty of extracting resources, to name a few – are already apparent.
受国外金主的慷慨支持，近几年来沙拉菲派原教旨主义 — — 一个偏隘的伊斯兰教流派，与几百年来在印度大量存在的更温和的苏菲派变体大相径庭 — — 正在孟加拉国蔓延。	Backed by lavish financing from abroad, Salafist fundamentalism – an intolerant version of Islam at odds with the more moderate Sufi-influenced variant that prevailed in India for centuries – has been spreading across Bangladesh in recent years.
比如，当牧师离开“圣职”时，他们便“退回世俗状态 ” — —有居高临下之嫌的专用词，天主教的顽固不化可见一斑。	For example, when priests leave “holy orders,” they are “reduced to the lay state” – a bit of condescending terminology that says a lot about the Church’s archaic mindset.
因此蓬佩奥有理由担心他在秘密会谈中的所见所闻会遭泄露，并反过来破坏峰会并夺走政府即将到手的政治胜利。	Thus, it was reasonable for Pompeo to fear that knowledge of his secret talks would be leaked in an effort to undermine the summit and deny the administration a potential political victory.
分歧不可避免，但让欧洲保持静止，抑或有时以不同的步伐让开放的欧洲不断前进，究竟哪一个才是更好的选择？	There will be disagreement, but is it better to have a static Europe or a Europe that advances, sometimes at different paces, and that is open to all?
华盛顿 — — 印度正面临多年来最严重的水资源危机，约有3亿3000万人（占全国人口的1/4）面临严重干旱的影响。	WASHINGTON, DC – India is currently facing its worst water crisis in years, with an estimated 330 million people – one-quarter of its population – affected by severe drought.
6月以来上证指数两位数的下跌之所以没有引起经济危机，主要是因为只有不到10%的中国家庭参与了股市，而股票只占家庭资产的不到15 % 。	The double-digit drop in the Shanghai Composite Index since June has not triggered an economic crisis largely because fewer than 10% of Chinese households participate in the stock market, and equities comprise less than 15% of household assets.
有时我们被邀请提早出席，希望我们能在官方代表到来之前就提早离开，这种方法有时管用，有时也会发生意外。	Or we were invited to come at an earlier hour in the hope that we would leave before the official representatives arrived, which sometimes worked and sometimes didn’t.
这是重要的，因为欧洲对俄国的一贯政策是欧洲面临的关键而又急迫的挑战之一，这一政策取决于波兰和德国之间的紧密合作。	This is important because a consistent European policy toward Russia – one of the key urgent challenges facing Europe – depends on close cooperation between Poland and Germany.
而这也是为什么我们呼吁实施一些额外手段去加强伊朗政治变革的前景，催生一个准备与人民和邻国和平共处的伊朗政府。	This is why additional measures are called for to improve the prospects for political change that brings about an Iranian government prepared to live in peace with its own people and its neighbors.
专家试图让美国人了解埃博拉传播有多么困难，以及埃博拉为何不可能在美国形成流行之势，但人们往往充耳不闻。	Experts’ attempts to impress upon Americans how difficult Ebola is to transmit, and how unlikely an Ebola epidemic in the US was, fell largely on deaf ears.
巴西最近登上了国际新闻的头版头条，但却不是因为城市暴力、自然灾害、政治腐败或亚马逊地区森林砍伐等传统的报导。	RIO DE JANEIRO – Brazil has been making international headlines of late, but not for traditional stories about urban violence, natural catastrophes, political corruption, or deforestation in the Amazon.
是的，民主党总统候选人伯尔尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sandees）说丹麦是理想的居住地，它做对了很多事。	Yes, Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was right that Denmark is a great place to live and does many things right.
俄罗斯与包括土耳其这个北约成员国在内的所有主要地区大国的一唱一和，证明了克里姆林宫外交政策的活力（以及利益导向 ） 。	Russia’s coordination with all major regional powers – including Turkey, a NATO member – attests to the dynamism (and cynicism) of the Kremlin’s foreign policy.
发自拉古纳海滩 — — 在高涨的期望和球迷汹涌澎湃的热情支持下，埃及国家男子足球队在时隔28年后再次入围世界杯决赛圈。	LAGUNA BEACH – Egypt’s national soccer team rode to Russia for their first World Cup finals in 28 years on a wave of lofty expectations and potent fan enthusiasm.
投资者认为这些风险或许不会升级，或者发达经济体的宽松货币政策和持续复苏能够遏制这些风险，这也许是对的。	Investors may be right that these risks will not materialize in their more severe form, or that loose monetary policies in advanced economies and continued recovery will contain such risks.
一部分 ， “ 记忆的丰富遗产”是植根于过去。 而另一部分，与现在相关并通往未来，是以公民共同建造公共生活的普遍意愿为构成要素的。	One part, the “rich inheritance of memories,” is rooted in the past, while the other, related to the present and opening the way to the future, consists in the common will of citizens to build their public life together.
叶利钦和他们有着共同的目标，但是有一点与他们不同：他认识到了帝制与民主的不相容性，所以愿意放弃苏联而努力在其国内建立民主制度。	Yeltsin aimed for the same goal. But he stands out from them in this respect: he understood that empire was incompatible with democracy, and so was willing to abandon the Soviet Union in order to try to build a democratic order at home.
在现有基础上，数学模型预测植物总共约有350,000种，比目前所知的多出15%左右。 这一数字与专家意见其实不谋而合。	Based on this development, mathematical models predict that roughly 15% more plant species exist than are currently known, for a total of some 350,000 species – a figure that is consistent with expert opinion.
他父亲的梦想被终结了，而他所有的只剩下无主题的实用主义，并成为他执政的鲜明印记，这一点他日后才逐渐认识到。	The dreams from his father were at an end, and he was left, as he only slowly realized, with the themeless pragmatism that has become the hallmark of his administration.
北约对科索沃的干预就是一例，这次事件中，几个政府选择对另一个政府（塞尔维亚）的主权进行干预，目的是阻止种族清洗和屠杀。	The NATO intervention in Kosovo was an example where a number of governments chose to violate the sovereignty of another government (Serbia) to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide.
根据经济学家巴里·艾肯格林（Barry Eichengreen ） 、 朴东炫（Donghyun Park）和康镐炫（Kwanho Shin）的研究，这一比例大约是美国人均收入的60 % （ 以2005年国际价格计算 ） 。	According to the economists Barry Eichengreen, Donghyun Park, and Kwanho Shin, that share is about 60% of America’s per capita income (at 2005 international prices).
当你购买通用汽车的产品时，你所付的每一美元中就有80美分揣进了通用汽车的腰包，而通用汽车公司所做的仅仅是自我管理。	When you buy a car from General Motors, 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM, which mostly only manages itself.
我们希望，在安全共享数据的同时保护隐私的能力能够鼓励个人、公司和政府广泛交流各自的想法，从而提高整个城市的生产率和创造力。	We hope that the ability to share data safely, while protecting privacy, will encourage individuals, companies, and governments to communicate their ideas widely, and so increase productivity and creativity across the entire city.
相反，传统发展经济学家会说，芬兰不应该出口木材；而应该将木材转化为纸和家具，以此获得附加值。 芬兰也这么做了。	By contrast, a traditional development economist would argue that it should not export wood; instead, it should add value by transforming the wood into paper or furniture – something that Finland also does.
10月，劳工部步其后尘，用“澄清”缓解了退休基金关于投资于产生社会和经济两方面回报的初创企业的顾虑。	In October, the Department of Labor followed up with a “clarification’’ that eased worries at pension funds about investing in ventures that produce social as well as economic returns.
在危机四伏的环境下，我们不可低估这一举动对阿根廷以及其他国家的重要性。 其他国家领导人正在密切观察如何应对自身经济困难的线索。	At a time of daunting crisis conditions, one should not underestimate the importance of this move not just for Argentina, but also for other countries, where leaders are watching closely for clues about how to deal with their own economic woes.
而罗姆尼则会重拾奥巴马早年许下的那些尚未兑现的承诺，虽然奥巴马会将罗姆尼称为一个见风使舵的“骑墙派 ” 。	Romney, for his part, will hold up Obama’s early, still-unmet promises, while Obama will call Romney a “flip-flopper” who changes his positions to suit the moment (and the audience).
希腊公民必然认为，如果他们在因为退出欧元区而导致的困难时期继续信任他们的政府，就可以摆脱严重的不公。	Greece’s citizens must believe that they are escaping grave injustice if they are to continue to trust their government during the difficult period that would follow an exit from the eurozone.
而对于开发利用核能资源的新方法，以及解决核废料问题来说，这么一个对强相互作用力的精确理解都将非常意义重大。	A preciseunderstanding of the strong force could be just as important, opening new ways to use nuclear-energy resources while solving the problems of safety and nuclear waste.
有些人会觉得在这个年龄生育孩子有点荒唐，因为大多数妇女在这个年纪已经做了祖母了；但更重要的问题是，如果他们的父母死亡或变得无力抚养他们，这些孩子将得到什么样的照顾呢？	Some will find it grotesque to become a mother at an age when most women are grandmothers, but the more significant question is what kind of care such children will have if their parents die or become incapable of rearing them.
同样，无论对于儿童还是成人，公共图书馆都能带来真正的价值 — — 让所有人拥有世俗和自由的集会空间，在赋予每个人学习机会的同时为他们提供数字化服务。	Likewise, for children and adults alike, there is real value in, say, public libraries – secular and free gathering spaces that offer universal access to learning and, increasingly, provide a gateway to digital services.
这一思想认为，长期而言，参与自由贸易的国家将发现新的增长渠道，失去了某个产业的工作的工人将在另一个产业找到新工作。	Countries that engage in free trade will find new channels for growth in the long run, the thinking goes, and workers who lose their jobs in one industry will find employment in another.
日益增加的球员跨国流动使得各国球技水平走向趋同，这一点从阿根廷、巴西、法国、德国，意大利和西班牙等传统足球强国的统治地位下降上可以看出。	The increased movement of players across borders has already contributed to a convergence among countries’ skill levels, reflected in the declining dominance of traditional powerhouses like Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.
和大部分革命一样，这场革命之所以没有发生，就像赫胥黎（Thomas Huxley）所预言的那样，是因为美妙的旧理论被丑陋的新事实所扼杀。	As with most revolutions, this one is not happening because, as Thomas Huxley surmised, a beautiful old theory has been killed by ugly new facts.
他甚至还更进一步挑明这一指向，批评各国可能抛弃巴黎气候协议的举措 — — 正如特朗普威胁要做的那样。	He was even more pointed in criticizing the prospect of abandoning the Paris climate agreement – as Trump has threatened to do.
这篇评论令那些只看到西方国家 — — 包括特朗普刚刚发表了就职演说的美国 — — 阴暗面的人感到震惊。	The piece came as a surprise to those who saw only bleak prospects for Western countries, not least the United States, where US President Donald Trump had just been inaugurated.
误导性宏观经济政策所赐让该比例继续下降至9 % ， 特别是里根时期，赤字支出和过于紧缩的货币政策导致美元飙升，破坏了竞争力。	That share fell further, to 9% because of misguided macroeconomic policies, especially during the Reagan era, when deficit spending and overly tight monetary policy caused the dollar to soar, undermining competitiveness.
这有一个前提：穆斯林兄弟会实现内部重组并找到办法与走极端路线的派系保持距离，并对脆弱群体和社会少数派推行包容性政策。	This presupposes that the Brothers reorganize themselves internally and find ways to distance themselves from more radical factions, and that they promote inclusive policies toward vulnerable groups and social minorities.
在负责同级的外交部时，他的主要成就是与法国结成紧密联盟并进行大量安全合作 — — 包括在核技术方面的合作。	Running a sort of parallel foreign ministry, his main achievement was the creation of a close alliance and strong security cooperation – including with respect to nuclear technology – with France.
第二个问题是人们为什么会接受极端思想？ 研究和安全人员对此进行了探索，并一致认为感觉受到排斥的人接受极端思想的可能性更大。	The second question – why are some people attracted to radical ideas? – has been explored by researchers and security practitioners, who generally agree that people are more inclined to accept radical ideologies if they feel alienated.
诚然，早在20世纪60年代初，肯尼迪政府成员就开始了战争的理智化，争论战略（包括反动乱战略）的合理性。	To be sure, in the early 1960’s, members of President John F. Kennedy’s administration intellectualized war and debated the merits of strategies, including counterinsurgency.
更重要的是，美国公司并非如同特朗普和国会共和党所声称的那样，是因为税率太高而囤积了数万亿美元现金而拒绝进行资本投资。	More to the point, US corporations aren’t hoarding trillions of dollars in cash and refusing to make capital investments because the tax rate is too high, as Trump and congressional Republicans claim.
列宁的分析也许是错误的，但如今，我们知道，他的结论是正确的，只是正确的原因是另外一个：金融资本主义迫使一国走向不可持续的负债。	Lenin may have gotten the underlying analysis wrong, but today we know that his conclusion may have been right for another reason: financial capitalism forces a country into unsustainable indebtedness.
Des objectifs si ambitieux, aussi irréalistes soient-ils, peuvent provoquer une dynamique de discipline, et pousser certains pays de l’UE à augmenter leurs dépenses, alors même que l’UE a lancé un certain nombre de programmes prometteurs.	Such ambitious goals, however unrealistic, can have a disciplining effect, leading some EU countries to increase their spending, while the EU itself has launched a number of promising schemes.
墨西哥可以利用一系列移民工具，如放松对危地马拉南部边境的控制，或者在美国当局无法证明其墨西哥国籍的情况下拒绝从美国接纳被驱逐者。	Mexico can use a number of tools on immigration, such as loosening controls on its southern border with Guatemala or refusing admission to deportees from the US unless American authorities can corroborate their Mexican nationality.
铁路系统容量有限，公路也只有14%能够畅通。 这并不令人惊奇，因为2000—2011年间巴西的基础设施投资平均只占GDP的2.2 % ， 远低于全球平均水平。	The rail system is limited, and only 14% of roads are paved, which is not surprising, given that Brazil’s investment in infrastructure averaged only 2.2% of GDP in 2000-2011 – well below the global average.
当我在1980年代初加入国际货币基金组织时，与非政府对口机构进行磋商 — — 无论是针对国家还是政策工作 — — 都是不受鼓励的。	When I joined the IMF in the early 1980s, discussions with non-government counterparts, whether on country or policy work, were discouraged. The situation today is very different.
相反，如果一国人均收入比另一国高100 % ， 那么它所接收的商务旅行者将多出130 % ， 它发出的商务旅行者将多出170 % 。	By contrast, a country with a per capita income that is 100% higher than another receives 130% more business travelers and sends 170% more people abroad.
比如，多数由政府主办的难民庇护所并未提供区分性别的浴室和厕所 — — 这对来自保守伊斯兰环境的女性不啻具有灾难性。	For example, most government refugee shelters didn’t provide gender-exclusive toilets and showers – a disaster for women from conservative Islamic backgrounds.
即将履新的特朗普政府必须充分明白，追求可持续性日程的经济和环境利益总和仍将推动各国和各公司朝这个方向努力。	It must be abundantly clear to the incoming administration that the combined economic and environmental interest in pursuing the sustainability agenda will continue to push countries and companies alike in that direction.
在我们了解到推动这些意外变化的因素之前，我们需要注意这些调查结果的呈现方式，以及它们如何为政策制定提供信息。	Until we understand what’s driving these unexpected changes, we need to be mindful of how survey findings are presented, and how they inform policymaking decisions.
两国都有着目空一切的民族主义，都相信自己的力量无法抗拒，而美国因陷入伊拉克和阿富汗战争的泥沼而江河日下更使他们觉得无所畏惧。	Both are marked by a defiant nationalism, and both feel irresistible, all the more so because they sense that the United States is in decline as a result of the quagmire in Iraq, if not in Afghanistan as well.
为了心灵导师所提供的安全，而心甘情愿将妻子和女儿奉献给他的人们，无法明白为何同样的赐予两位女性的“保佑”会让他锒铛入狱。	People who were willing to lend their wives and daughters to their guru, for the sake of the security he offered, could not understand why the same “blessing,” extended to the two girls, should land him in jail.
而现在他拥有了卡钦斯基的支持，并因此深受马切雷维奇和（刚刚实现了对法院直接控制的）司法部长兹比格涅夫·兹波布罗等其他法律与正义党领导人物的妒忌。	And now that he has Kaczyński’s support, he is deeply resented by other leading PiS figures such as Macierewicz and justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who has just assumed direct control of the courts.
“身处全球金融系统核心 ， ” 他说 ， “ 扩大了追寻英国储蓄的机构的投资机会，也增强了英国制造业和创新行业的全球竞争力 。 ”	“Being at the heart of the global financial system,” he said, “broadens the investment opportunities for the institutions that look after British savings, and reinforces the ability of UK manufacturing and creative industries to compete globally.”
保持内部凝聚力的一种方法是创造“恶魔 ” — —这是从二十世纪九十年代阿尔及利亚和二十世纪七八十年代阿根廷的“肮脏战争”中学来的。	And one way to maintain internal cohesion is to create “demons” – a lesson learned from the “dirty wars” in Algeria in the 1990’s and Argentina in the 1970’s and 1980’s.
正如发明这一词汇的约翰•威廉姆森（John Williamson）在2002年所指出的那样，这些措施“是十全十美，万无一失的，因此我们才有必要就此达成共识 。 ”	As John Williamson, who coined the term, put it in 2002, these measures “are motherhood and apple pie, which is why they commanded a consensus.”
欧盟这样做的一个原因是不愿和俄罗斯发生争端。 俄罗斯仍将我们视为其紧密的盟友、自然的贸易伙伴和其领导下的不断扩大的经济区的成员。	One reason for this is that the EU does not want to pick a fight with Russia, which still sees us as its close ally, natural business partner, and as members of an enlarging Russian-led economic zone.
如果这些富裕国家继续只给予那些最贫穷国家一点点的、不足以解决问题的帮助，那么这些最贫穷国家将永远不会摆脱贫困。	If donors keep giving only a little bit of help, but not enough to solve the problems of the poorest countries, these countries will never escape poverty's grip.
举个例子，最初令阿迪提亚纳受到关注的是其煽动性的反穆斯林言论 — — 为此他因煽动宗教紧张的罪名 — — 并领导一队专门袭击穆斯林目标的志愿者 — — 于2007年在监狱里蹲了11天。	Adityanath, for example, first gained attention for his incendiary anti-Muslim speeches – he spent 11 days in jail in 2007 for fomenting religious tension – and for leading a squad of volunteers who specialized in attacking Muslim targets.
考虑到中国净对外贷款头寸高达1.8万亿美元或GDP的17.2 % ， 央行有足够的流动性，不必推出非常规货币政策（极低利率 ） ， 而只需降低银行的准备金率来应对可能的债务危机。	Given that China’s net external lending position amounts to $1.8 trillion, or 17.2% of GDP, the central bank has enough liquidity to reduce banks’ reserve requirements without resorting to unconventional monetary policy.
在爱尔兰逮捕了多位试图谋杀一名将先知默罕默德描绘成一条狗的瑞典卡通画家的所谓圣战者之后，这个问题变得更加紧迫了。	This issue has been given new urgency by the arrests in Ireland of alleged jihadists from several countries who are accused of plotting to murder a Swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet Mohammed as a dog.
所有美国的袭击都发生在偏远的北部，巴基斯坦部落的瓦齐里斯坦地区，尽管阿富汗塔利班及其哈卡尼组织和希克马蒂亚尔组织等盟友没有隐藏在那里。	All of the US strikes have occurred farther north, in Pakistan’s tribal Waziristan region, although the leadership of the Afghan Taliban and of its allied groups, like the Haqqani network and the Hekmatyar band, is not holed up there.
因此，政策着力点必须也放在耶鲁大学政治学家雅各布·哈克（Jacob Hacker）所谓的“前分配 ” （ pre-distribution）上，即改变市场决定的工资收入结构。	The policy focus, therefore, must also be on what Yale University political scientist Jacob Hacker calls “pre-distribution”: changing the market-determined structure of wage incomes.
在六月发布的一份报告中，六家银行汇报了自联合报告开始四年来他们如何提供了超过1000亿美元的气候融资。	In a report released in June, the six banks described how they have provided more than $100 billion in climate finance in the four years since joint reporting began.
这些问题属于错误的二分法，我们可以通过制定扬“和”抑“或”的政策来避免它们，让各种利益都能得到平等的照顾。	Those are all false dichotomies, which we can avoid by developing policies that favor “and” over “or,” allowing all sets of interests to be pursued in parallel.
但更令人忧心的是，曾经有段时期连挪威诺贝尔奖评选委员会都似乎要向北京低头，但委员们最终决定坚持原决议 — — 这才是唯一的正道，因为一个褒扬道德勇气的奖项是不能被其颁发者所妥协和出卖的。	But in the end it decided to go ahead with the award. That is only fitting: an award for moral courage ought not to be compromised by those offering it.
“这个国家的人受够了专家 ， ” 戈夫不耐烦地说，他指的是“来自名字由缩写组成的组织的专家，他们总是说自己知道怎么做最好，但每次都弄错 。 ”	“People in this country have had enough of experts,” Gove testily explained, referring to “experts from organizations with acronyms, saying they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong.”
全球治理往往只是保护既得利益全球计划的代名词，也正因如此，它所起到的主要作用是在推进全球化的同时协调国内经济政策。	Too often, global governance is another name for the pursuit of these interests’ global agenda, which is why it ends up mainly furthering globalization and harmonizing domestic economic policies.
如果没有来自国际社会 — — 特别是和平协定担保国迅速而大胆的确保诺言兑现的行动，我们将会失去这次宝贵的机会。	Without swift and bold action from the international community – particularly from those who guarantee the peace agreement – to ensure that promises are kept, this opportunity will be lost.
但该网站还公开了年轻的穆兄会活跃分子对戈兹兰的立场的批评 — — 对于极少公开内部异见的组织来说，这是一个引人注目的情况。	But it also published harsh criticism of Ghozlan’s position by young Brotherhood activists – a notable development for an organization in which dissent is rarely publicized.
正如一位阿富汗政府官员说的那样 ， “ 如果你不能清除一个腐败的法官，你怎么能够对付塔利班呢 ？ ”	As one senior Afghan government official said, “If you can’t remove a corrupt judge, how can you deal with the Taliban?”
格里洛与北方联盟的马蒂奥·萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）十分相似，他没有什么政治经验，不了解欧洲的历史，没有多少经过提炼的观点，也没有可信的未来愿景。	Grillo – much like Lega Nord’s Matteo Salvini – has scant political experience, little knowledge of European history, few refined arguments, and no credible vision for the future.
《金融时报》最近对美联储副主席斯坦利·费舍尔（Stanley Fischer）的采访相当引人注目，因为它揭露了一些重大分歧。	A remarkable recent interview in the Financial Times with Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer laid bare some major disagreements.
此外征召人们牺牲性命换来的高额战争利润激起了民众的普遍愤怒，导致许多人（且不仅仅是美国人）开始鼓吹“财富征用 ” 。	Moreover, widespread anger over high war profits while men were being conscripted to risk their lives led many people, not just Americans, to start advocating for “wealth conscription.”
此外，两类与能源相关的安全问题也越来越引起人们的担忧：即由能源应用特点所引发的暴力危险与日俱增，以及能源使用的成本居高不下。	Moreover, there is deepening concern about two types of energy-related security problems: the increasing risk of violence stemming from the nature of our energy use, and the high cost of that energy.
类似政府最近收紧信贷这样的狭隘政策将使其难以将金融资源导入实体经济 — — 而这正是李克强经济学的一个重要目标。	Narrow policies like the government’s recent credit tightening will make it difficult to direct financial resources to the real economy – one of the primary objectives of “Likonomics.”
使用这一规则看起来相当合理，如果我们将自己置于被绑架者的处境，或想象我们的孩子、父母或配偶被恐怖分子绑架并且获得交钱放人的可信条件的话。	Applying it can seem justifiable if we put ourselves in the position of a captive, or imagine that our child, parent, or spouse has been captured by terrorists who make a credible offer to release our loved one for a ransom.
高额关税可以破坏市场并限制贸易，恰恰因为企业希望减少他们所缴纳的关税 — — 并因此在全球范围内以相应的方式来分配产能。	Higher tariffs fragment markets and limit trade, precisely because companies want to reduce the taxes they pay – and allocate production accordingly around the world.
考虑一下这种情况。 法国有着欧盟中最高的人口出生率（每个妇女有差不多两个孩子 ） ， 甚至比人口激增的爱尔兰还要高。	Consider this: France has the highest fertility rate in the European Union (just under two children per woman), even ahead of booming Ireland.
最近，哈佛大学心理学家史蒂文·平克（Steven Pinker）出版了一本书，记录了各项福利的长期积极趋势，他称之为“启蒙的成果 ” 。	Recently, the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker published a book documenting long-term positive trends in multiple dimensions of wellbeing, which he calls “the fruits of the Enlightenment.”
但在公开场合发表这样的言论已经不再起作用了。 这倒不是因为罗马尼亚人不认同这样的观点（许多人也这么认为 ） ， 而是从左翼到右翼的政治阶层都想成为欧洲的一部分因而会与任何危及这一愿望的人划清界限。	But saying that publicly won't work anymore, not because Romanians do not think this way (many certainly do), but because the political class from left to right wants to be part of Europe and won't associate with anyone who puts that desire at risk.
技术进步在一个复杂而深度一体化的生态系统赵红发生，这意味着它同时影响着经济结构、政府、安全安排和人们的日常生活。	Technological progress is occurring within a complex and deeply integrated ecosystem, meaning that it simultaneously affects economic structures, governments, security arrangements, and people's daily lives.
提振名义GDP的三大因素 — — 真实产出增加、出口相对价格上涨和实际汇率升值 — — 并不是逐一独立作用的。	The three phenomena that boost nominal GDP – increases in real output, a rise in the relative price of exports, and real exchange-rate appreciation – do not operate independently of one another.
由于许多苏格兰人 — — 其中62％的人投票支持留在欧盟 — — 都非常厌恶在英格兰民族主义的束缚下被英国保守党政府拖入一场硬脱欧进程，苏格兰独立的选项就变得难以抗拒。	With many Scots – 62% of whom voted to remain in the EU – leery of being dragged into a hard Brexit by a Conservative UK government in thrall to English nationalism, the case for Scottish independence could be compelling.
但是通过称之为战争、并把基地组织及其领导人本拉登点名为对手，美国政府给某些国内变化提供了理由。 这些国内变化在9/11袭击之前是不会被任何自由国家所接受的。	By calling them war – and naming an opponent, usually al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden – the United States government has justified domestic changes that, before the 9/11 attacks, would have been unacceptable in any free country.
这样的背信弃义令印度民众作呕，而9月印度人又被迫为再次发生的袭击事件哀悼，那次跨境袭击中某陆军基地的18名士兵因此死亡。	Indians, sickened by this perfidy, found themselves mourning again in September, when another cross-border assault killed 18 soldiers at an Army base in Uri.
为罹患疟疾的孩子寻医问药的家长，为孩子的上学奔波的家长，都必须自掏腰包 — — 这对很多家庭来说成为不可能的任务。	Parents seeking treatment for a malaria-stricken child, or a place for that child in school, must pay from their own pocket – an impossibility for many.
如果从现在开始增加卫生投资，那么到2030年，我们可以大幅接近所有家长都不会因为可预防原因失去孩子 — — 所有孩子也不会因为可预防原因失去一位双亲的目标。	If we increase investments in health now, by 2030 we can be that much closer to a world in which no parent loses a child – and no child loses a parent – to preventable causes.
战略核武器重新成为世界政治的中心议题不仅提升了俄罗斯的政治分量，还把国际社会的目光重新聚焦在了这个俄罗斯依然可以以世界强权自居的领域。	The return of strategic nuclear weapons to the center of world politics increases Russia’s political weight and highlights the field in which Russia can still assert itself as a superpower.
这是在1995年发生的事情，当时货币基金组织开始鼓吹资本性账户的自由化，在亚洲金融危机时候实行过度紧缩银根的财政拯救方案，并试图单枪匹马的扭转亚洲经济。	That is what happened in the second half of the 1990’s, as the IMF began to preach capital-account liberalization, applied over-stringent fiscal remedies during the Asian financial crisis, and single-handedly tried to reshape Asian economies.
在过去十年中至少有20个国家建立了由国家出资赞助的战略投资基金，与私营部门合作伙伴共同投资基础设施项目。	Over the last decade, at least 20 countries have established state-sponsored strategic investment funds to co-invest in infrastructure projects with private-sector partners.
我最近在第五大道上的以马内利会堂 — — 这里堪称纽约最美轮美奂的犹太教堂，也是世界最大的犹太教堂之一 — — 接受了《纽约时报书评 》 （ New York Times Book Review）编辑帕梅拉·保罗（Pamela Paul）的采访。	At Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue, the most beautiful synagogue in New York and one of the largest in the world, I was recently interviewed by Pamela Paul, editor of the New York Times Book Review.
诺贝尔奖获得者、凯恩斯的反对者罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）在2008年承认 ： “ 我猜每个人都是隐藏很深的凯恩斯主义者 。 ”	As the Nobel laureate Robert Lucas, an opponent of Keynes, admitted in 2008: “I guess everyone is a Keynesian in a foxhole.”
）结果表明，只有少数国家的再分配造成了10点以上的基尼系数变化，并且再平衡���动的基尼系数波动如果超过13点，将对增长造成消极影响。	They show that only a handful of countries redistribute enough to make more than a ten-point difference in the coefficient, and that redistribution-fueled swings of more than 13 points do tend to have an adverse effect on growth.
首先，巴西石油和Prominp就具体的技能 — — 比如船坞焊接、管接和石油工程 — — 制定五年期人才规划项目。	First, Petrobras and Prominp develop a five-year personnel projection in specific skill areas, such as shipyard welding, pipefitting, and petroleum engineering.
巴黎—德国财政部长朔伊布勒最近将希腊退出欧元的选项摆上了台面，他希望释放一个信号，即，任何一个成员国都不能免于货币联盟严格纪律的约束。	PARIS – When Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, recently tabled the option of a Greek exit from the euro, he wanted to signal that no member could abstain from the monetary union’s strict disciplines.
由于美国共和党人幼稚的政治固执导致该国政治瘫痪，而欧洲则着眼于确保设计拙劣的欧元计划能够幸存，因而达沃斯会议上最主要的抱怨就是全球领袖的缺失。	With the US politically paralyzed by the Republicans’ infantile political tantrums, and Europe focused on ensuring the survival of the ill-conceived euro project, the lack of global leadership was a major complaint at Davos.
根据中共中央统战部官员徐志涛所说，所谓“噶玛巴（可能）是中国特工或间谍的指控反映出印方对中方一贯持有的不信任态度 。 ”	According to Xu Zhitao, an official at the Chinese Communist Party central committee’s United Front Work Department, the allegation that “the Karmapa [may be] a Chinese agent or spy shows that India is keeping its mistrustful attitude toward China.”
九十年代，冷战刚刚结束后的一个短暂时间，世界看似好像会永久和平，不会受到国力的困扰，这一时代已经一去不复返了。	Gone are the 1990’s, when for a brief moment in the immediate aftermath of the end of the Cold War, the world looked as if it would be permanently peaceful and unconcerned with power.
数十亿消费者将步入各自国家的中产阶级行列，新的社会网络正在演化生成，气候变化也在日益成为全球商业的重要影响因素。	As that happens, billions of consumers will enter these countries’ middle classes, new social networks will evolve, and climate change will become a growing factor in global commerce.
据无党派立场的国会预算办公室（CBO）的测算，美国金融健康也会受到影响，到2027年将产生大约1.214万亿美元的新增赤字。	And, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, America’s financial health will suffer as well, with an estimated $1.214 trillion added to the deficit by 2027.
伯克利 — — 国际货币基金组织总裁克里斯蒂娜•拉加德不久前发出警告：增长放缓的“平庸常态”正摆在世人面前。	BERKELEY – Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, recently warned that the world risks a new “mediocre normal” of slower growth.
CIYOTA是一个位于克扬瓦力（Kyangwali）难民安置营的由年轻人领导的志愿组织。 在尼日利亚，布鲁明·索因卡（Blooming Soyinka）的非洲花朵（Africa Blooms）组织雇用了六位经济困难的残疾工匠，为这些雇员和她们的家庭创造不断改善和教育子女的条件。	In Nigeria, Blooming Soyinka employs a half-dozen economically disadvantaged and disabled artisans at Africa Blooms, creating conditions for those employees and their families to thrive and educate their children.
在关闭关塔纳摩，禁止酷刑之后，我们必须撤销《爱国者法案 》 ， 从而恢复宪法对于毫无法律根据的窃听和监视的约束力。	“After closing Guantánamo Bay and forbidding torture, we must repeal the Patriot Act, thereby restoring the Constitution’s restraints against warrantless wiretapping and surveillance.
作为世界第二大外国直接投资来源地，欧盟有着卓著的影响力，欧洲投资者给项目和地区带来信誉，从而有利于吸引更多投资。	As the world’s second-largest source of foreign direct investment, the EU wields considerable influence, with European investors bringing credibility to projects and regions, thereby serving to attract further investment.
美国的集中财政也使得各州得以在真正的预算平衡状态下运转，只消有相对较小的“雨天”基金予以调节就行了。	The centralized fiscal role in the US also allows all of the individual states to operate with true balanced budgets, modified only by relatively small “rainy day” funds.
实验经济学家发现人们会牺牲自己的资源去惩罚那些作弊者和占便宜的人，并会将此施加于那些永远不会与之发生互动的陌生人身上 — — 一种被称为“利他性惩罚”的行为。	Experimental economists have found that people will sacrifice their own resources to punish cheaters and free riders, and will do this even to anonymous strangers that they will never again interact with – a behavior dubbed “altruistic punishment.”
与此相反，在欧洲人眼中，一些美国人是极端个人主义的代表；在某种程度上，美国式的乐观主义也被解读为难以接受的社会丑闻。	By contrast, when the personal situations of many individual Americans are examined through European eyes, the extreme individualism that constitutes a key part of American optimism translates into an unacceptable social scandal.
对于作为发达国家一员的美国来说，如果削减温室气体排放所导致的高额成本和税收意味着降低经济复苏的速度，那么政府当然也不会接受强加于其身上的大幅减排限额。	The United States, for one, will not accept ceilings that reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions significantly if it means accepting higher costs and taxes that risk slowing economic recovery.
“如果把所有经济学家放到一起 ， ” 萧伯纳曾经做过著名的总结 ， “ 他们不会得到任何结论 。 ”	“If all the economists were laid end to end,” George Bernard Shaw famously quipped, “they would not reach a conclusion.”
当然，新评分标准不仅对企业本身、而且对试图在“拉动”机制和目前的优先药物需求间达成平衡的决策者也非常重要。	And, of course, the new scoring will also be important to the companies themselves, and for policymakers who are trying to strike a balance between “pull” incentives and current priority-drug needs.
伊斯兰世界内部同样存在着阿拉伯人和非阿拉伯人，逊尼派和什叶派，原教旨主义分子和神学温和派人士之间的冲突。	The Islamic world is riven by disputes between Arab and non-Arab, Sunni and Shia, and Salafi extremists and theological moderates.
构建信任进程是为了克服绥靖和强硬政策的局限性：绥靖政策完全取决于朝鲜似有若无的善意，而强硬政策则意味着无情施压。	The trust-building process was formulated to overcome the limitations of both appeasement and hardline policies: while the former depended entirely on the North’s tenuous good faith, the latter implied only relentless pressure.
必须避免做出那些导致空中楼阁计划以及非理性预期的过度乐观估计，因为刚刚摆脱内战的当地政府将无力完成这些项目，当年在危地马拉发生的一切就是一个例子。	Avoid overly optimistic projections that lead to unworkable plans and unreasonable expectations, which the government will not be able to fulfill, as happened in Guatemala, for example, when its civil war ended.
这也意味着，如果希腊可以走出当前的衰退，那么不管按绝对水平还是按占GDP比重计算，其国民债务都将减少。	This also implies that if Greece could escape from its current recession, its national debt would decline, both absolutely and as a share of GDP.
如果公共就业过去三年的增长速度能像乔治·W·布什总统任期时那样与人口的增长速度相等，那么这800,000个新增就业岗位将使失业率维持在7%左右，而不是8.2 % 。	If public employment had grown during the last three years at about the same rate as the population, as it did during George W. Bush’s presidency, the unemployment rate would be around 7% rather than 8.2%, owing to about 800,000 additional jobs.
乌克兰再供款的利率是16 % ， 低于通货膨胀10 % ， 这就意味者乌克兰的年度利率是负10 % 。	Ukraine’s current refinance rate is 16% a year, 10% less than inflation, which means that Ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10% a year.
里德在谈到史蒂夫·努钦（Steve Mnuchin ） — —前高盛执行副总裁 — — 就任财政部长的合适性时正是持有这一观点：	Reed made precisely this point in speaking to the suitability of Steve Mnuchin – a former Goldman Sachs executive vice president – as Treasury Secretary:
当非洲国家发展起来之后，国内状况会得到足够的改善，吸引人才流回祖国，数量大增的流失人才的确实是会回去的，印度、韩国和中国就是明证。	When development has taken off, and conditions have improved sufficiently to attract people back to their homelands, the hugely increased diaspora would indeed return, as they have done in India, South Korea, and China.
1997年，在捷克共和国、匈牙利和波兰正式加入欧盟两年前，欧盟与俄罗斯达成协议 — — 也就是所谓的成立法案 — — 以缓冲由此带来的影响。	In 1997, two years before the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland became full members, the Alliance reached an agreement with Russia – the so-called Founding Act – to cushion the impact.
其中之一是约旦河西岸法塔赫基层组织领导人马尔万·巴尔毫迪，此人现正在以色列监狱中服刑，罪名是领导了2000年爆发的流血叛乱，并直接参与策划多起谋杀以色列平民的事件。	Marwan Barghouti, the leader of Fatah’s grassroots group on the West Bank, is now in an Israeli prison for organizing the bloody uprising that began in 2000, and for direct involvement in planning the killings of many Israeli civilians.
不再梦想欧洲的欧洲人 — — 他们把和平、妥协以及最重要的自由视为理所当然 — — 没有意识到事态的严重性。	Europeans who have stopped dreaming about Europe, who take peace, reconciliation, and above all freedom for granted, do not realize what is at stake.
即便经济学家无法为这种迅速且激进的变革构建出模型，他们也不应该受到谴责，因为这只不过反映了我们当前的知识水平，以及经济学真的非常、非常复杂的现实。	Economists’ inability to model such rapid, radical change should not be taken as a condemnation of the discipline; it is simply a reflection of the state of our knowledge, and of the fact that the economy is really, really complicated.
政策制定者（也许还有金融市场）可能认为中央银行会通过激进的非常规货币政策（这是用来压制短期及长期利率的）来提供足够的桥接功能。	Policymakers (and perhaps financial markets) may have believed that central banks would provide an adequate bridging function through aggressive unconventional monetary policy designed to hold down short- and long-term interest rates.
与此同时，一名盲人人权分子从非法软禁他的家中逃了出来，跑到了美国驻北京大使馆寻求避难，随后在声明自己家人遭到所在地当局威胁后才离开了使馆。	Meanwhile, a blind human-rights activist escapes from illegal house arrest, finds refuge in the United States’ embassy in Beijing, and leaves the compound only after claims that Chinese authorities in his hometown had threatened his family.
如果承诺投入早期阶段的资金能在未来五年内持续到位，那么总额可能达到我们在审查报告中所提议的20亿美元。	If the amount of money that has been pledged for early-stage funding is sustained over the next five years, the total could reach the $2 billion that we recommended in the Review.
首先，先行财政紧缩 — — 不管多么必不可少 — — 在加速经济收缩，因为更高的税收和更低的政府支出和转移支付拉低了可支配收入和总需求。	First, front-loaded fiscal austerity – however necessary – is accelerating the contraction, as higher taxes and lower government spending and transfer payments reduce disposable income and aggregate demand.
比如说，统计人员也在绞尽脑汁地思考如何统计消费者因数字化而实现的质量提升和传递速度加快所带来的益处。	Statisticians struggle, for example, to account for how consumers are benefiting from the increased quality and speed of delivery that often results from digitalization.
现在，美国不应该重复“这与伊斯兰教无关”之类的老生常谈，而应该承认美国已经成为激进伊斯兰与开明伊斯兰和法治之间的战斗的新战场。	Instead of repeating like a broken record that “this has nothing to do with Islam,” it is time to admit that the US has become yet another theater in the battle between the Islam of the radicals and the Islam of enlightenment and the rule of law.
让其接受“政府问责局（Government Accountability Office ） “ 审计”的法案有望在国会两院获得通过。	"Bills subjecting the United States' central bank to “auditing"" by the Government Accountability Office are likely to be passed by both houses of Congress."
几年前，一部俄罗斯电影径直以《1672》为题，直指俄罗斯历史上的动荡年代（Time of Troubles ） ， 当时，领导不力导致俄罗斯受到波兰贵族和资本家的侵略而亡国。	A few years ago, a Russian film simply entitled 1612 evoked the Time of Troubles, when weak leadership caused Russia to be invaded and subverted by insidious Polish aristocrats and capitalists.
机器人时代正在来临，或者它来得不如我们想的那么快；当它真的来临时，机器人把所有人都失业，或者它们会创造和毁掉的一样多的岗位。	The robots are coming, or they’re not coming as fast as we think; when they do come, they’ll put everyone out of work, or they’ll create as many jobs as they destroy.
在网络化的世界中，我们做的每一件事都会影响他人，我们必须学会超越自我意识，追求合作、共创、共同进化和集体智慧。	In a networked world, where everything we do affects others, we must learn to think beyond ourselves, and pursue cooperation, co-creation, co-evolution, and collective intelligence.
今年5月，巴拿马当局扣留了一艘载有磷酸盐的驶往加拿大的船只，这艘船上的磷酸盐是由一家国有摩洛哥企业在在西撒哈拉占领区非法开采的。	This past May, the Panamanian authorities detained a Canada-bound ship carrying phosphates that had been illegally mined by a state-owned Moroccan company in occupied Western Sahara.
��5或10种不同的政府赞助且需要公众竞相购买的基金的突然出现将向市场传达一个讯息，即在这种环境之下，其他人在为资产估值时会使用什么模式。	And the sudden appearance of between five and ten different government-sponsored funds that make public bids for assets will convey information to the markets about what models other people are using to try to value assets in this environment.
确实，尽管前所未有的危机后美联储资产大概翻了三倍到3万亿美元 — — 并可能在未来一年内达到4万亿美元，美国的消费还是前所未有的回落了。	Indeed, notwithstanding an unprecedented post-crisis tripling of Fed assets to roughly $3 trillion – probably on their way to $4 trillion over the next year – US consumers have pulled back as never before.
通过量化宽松实现的激进的货币扩张在欧元区也更加复杂、更具政治正义性，因为作为货币区的欧元区不存在可供中央银行购买的联邦债务。	Aggressive monetary expansion through quantitative easing is also far more complicated and politically contentious in a currency area with no federal debt for the central bank to buy.
大国不可避免地可以做更多的事情来控制经济，因此也就更为受到诱惑实行干预来应对来自既得利益集团的政治压力。	A larger state can inevitably do more to control the economy, and hence is exposed to the costly temptation to intervene in response to political pressure from vested interests.
3年之后，一个以巴基斯坦为基地的恐怖分子团队在印度的金融中心孟买大开杀戒，扼杀了超过160条生命 — — 也扼杀了由此次板球比赛所开创的外交局面。	Three years later, a Pakistan-based terrorist group killed more than 160 people in Mumbai, India’s financial capital – and, with them, the diplomatic opening initiated by cricket.
与此同时，新技术提高了高技能工人的需求，同时降低了低技能工人的需求 — — 这一趋势令高技能和低技能工人之间的工资差距雪上加霜。	Meanwhile, new technologies raise demand for skilled workers, while reducing demand for their less-skilled counterparts – a trend that fuels the expansion of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled.
同样，随着欧盟演进为一个联邦国家，其忠诚的公民会拒绝基于种族亲缘性的民族主义并转而认同联邦宪法的民主原则。	Similarly, as the EU evolved into a federal state, its loyal citizens would reject nationalism based on ethnic affinities and instead identify with the democratic principles of the federation’s constitution.
而近年来，像杰里米·科尔宾这样的政界人士在成为英国工党领袖之前，支持自己的国家退出北约，而退出的理由恰恰是因为北约致力于以武力为手段展开共同防御。	And in recent years, politicians like Jeremy Corbyn, before he became leader of the UK Labour Party, have supported withdrawing their countries from the alliance, precisely because it is committed to using force as a means of mutual defense.
非洲大湖区持续不断的暴力活动已经夺去了数百万民众的生命，究其根源是因为1994年卢旺达的种族灭绝和胡图族难民大批涌入邻国。	The ongoing violence in Africa’s Great Lakes region, which has claimed millions of civilian lives, is rooted in the 1994 Rwanda genocide and the resulting flood of Hutu refugees into neighboring states.
报纸的头条刊登着各种各样的新的就业信息，但这仍然满足不了那些即将步入劳动市场的年轻人的就业需要。 这些消息对那些想要再次获得就业机会的50岁左右的人们来意义并不是很大。	Headlines announcing new hiring – still not enough to keep pace with the number of those who would normally have entered the labor force – meant little to the 50 year olds with little hope of ever holding a job again.
据最新的麦肯锡全球研究所报告，最为数字化的部门 — — 通过数字资产、数字用途和数字劳动力等十八个指标排序 — — 所获得的利润率显著高于传统部门。	According to a recent McKinsey Global Institute report, the most digitized sectors – ranked by 18 metrics on digital assets, digital usage, and digital workforce – enjoy significantly higher profit margins than traditional sectors.
最后，在其任期的第二年，奥巴马必须“设定更高的目标 ” — — 如同他去年夏天在全美有色人种协进会（ NAACP ）的一次演讲中所言。	Finally, in his second year, Obama must, as he put it last summer in a speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), “aim higher.”
悲哀的是，目前只有科威特和迪拜开始允许PPP，而只有沙特阿拉伯想要私有化机场（Jeddah和Dammam ） 。	Sadly, only Kuwait and Dubai have so far moved to allow PPPs, while only Saudi Arabia intends to privatize airports (Jeddah and Dammam).
在单一货币实施的第一个十年里，私人投资者相信所有欧元区主权债券一样安全，这使得外围国的利率也十分低，尽管其政府存在巨大的赤字，积累了巨额债务。	During the single currency’s first decade, private investors’ belief in the equality of all eurozone sovereign bonds kept interest rates low in the peripheral countries, even as their governments ran up large deficits and accumulated massive debt.
据医学研究所（Institute of Medicine）估计，光是在美国，每年就有7,500亿美元 — — 约占医疗总支出的30 % — —被“浪费在不必要的服务、过高的行政成本、欺诈和其他问题上 。 ”	The Institute of Medicine estimates that in the United States alone, some $750 billion a year – about 30% of total health-care spending – is “wasted on unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud, and other problems.”
乌克兰反对派团体致力于建立一个同普京总统领导之下的俄国截然不同的市民社会以及健康的政党，为此可谓历经万难。	Against all odds, Ukraine's opposition groups have helped forge a civil society and healthy political parties far beyond anything seen in President Vladimir Putin's Russia.
英格兰银行货币政策委员会的投票制度决定了其行长比较难以获知什么时候会出现大部分人支持紧缩的情况，而一些成员的观点，在最近几个月中左右摇摆。	The voting system used by the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee makes it harder for the governor to know when a majority for tightening will emerge, and some members’ views have been oscillating in recent months.
各国政府需要采取行动保护现有生态系统，恢复和扩大遭到破坏的生态系统 — — 并且以以人为本的方式实现。	Governments will need to take action to conserve existing ecosystems – and restore and expand degraded ecosystems – in people-friendly ways.
鉴于美韩两国对反映朝鲜核进展的情报做出了相同的评估，更不用说韩国在面临核威胁时表现出来的脆弱性，两国未能达成实际协议的确是非常令人不安的结果。	Given that the US and South Korea have the same assessment of the intelligence regarding North Korea’s nuclear progress, not to mention South Korea’s vulnerability, their failure to reach a practical agreement is troubling.
尽管2017年的美国陷入了深度分裂，但美国人民仍然对民主的核心原则坚定不移：自由、公平、定期的选举以及对政治、宗教和经济自由的保护。	Although America in 2017 is deeply divided, Americans remain committed to the central tenets of democracy: free, fair, and regular elections and the protection of political, religious, and economic liberty.
为了证明这不仅仅是一种理论假设，巩固财政的支持者举出20世纪80年代前期的丹麦、80年代后期的爱尔兰和20世纪90年代的芬兰作为例证。	As evidence that this is not merely a hypothetical possibility, advocates of fiscal consolidation point to cases like Denmark in the early 1980’s, Ireland in the late 1980’s, and Finland in the 1990’s.
许多人似乎认为，仅仅由于在过去十年中美国经济增长快于欧洲和日本，因而在以后的二十年里也是如此。 这一观点不可思议。	It is curious how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years simply because it has done so for the past ten years.
此外，那些发出“分裂”警告的人都忽视了一个事实：欧盟以及货币联盟的构建一直以来都是以不同的速度在推进。	Moreover, alarmist talk of a “split” overlooks the reality that the EU and the monetary union have long been moving at different speeds.
托克维尔的噩梦还没有在美国的现实中出现，但俄罗斯、土耳其、匈牙利（也许还有波兰）的情况已经与此不远。	De Tocqueville’s nightmare is not yet the reality in the US, but it is close to what we see in Russia, Turkey, Hungary, and perhaps Poland.
眼看着自己与萨利赫的关系逐渐恶化而自身的影响力日渐衰微，阿赫玛尔意识到自己对萨利赫的忠诚已经成为了一种负担。	His relationship with Saleh frayed and his influence waning, al-Ahmar understood that his loyalty to Saleh had become a liability.
而波兰新任欧洲事务部长西曼斯基（Konrad Szymanski）在巴黎袭击发生不到24小时就用该事件指责欧洲的缺陷。	And Poland’s new European affairs minister, Konrad Szymanski, did not wait 24 hours after the Paris attacks before using them to denounce Europe’s flaws.
联合国儿童基金会报告，只要采取用肥皂洗手等简单的措施，就能让腹泻和呼吸系统感染发病率分别降低40%和25 % 。	UNICEF reports that something as simple as hand washing with soap can cut rates of diarrhea and respiratory infections by more than 40% and 25%, respectively.
它还将带来巨大的经济增长，或许会让欧盟GDP增加120亿欧元（合127亿美元 ） ， 同时支持双方的商品和服务贸易增长近25 % 。	It will also provide a substantial economic boost, possibly adding around €12 billion ($12.7 billion) to the EU’s GDP, while underpinning a nearly 25% increase in the trade of goods and services for both sides.
这有利于增加基础设施投资，如若增幅能达到GDP的1 % ， 则可以让印度增加340万个工作岗位，美国增加150万个，巴西增加130万个，印度尼西亚增加700,000个。	This would facilitate higher infrastructure investment, with an increase equivalent to 1% of GDP translating into an additional 3.4 million jobs in India, 1.5 million in the United States, 1.3 million in Brazil, and 700,000 in Indonesia.
乐观者会说，这是与其说是因为厌恶布鲁塞尔或斯特拉斯堡本身，毋宁说是因为公众结成了一个“更加欧洲”的联盟，它有一个技术官僚的重点：单一市场和缺少有吸引力的替代模式。	Optimists might say that this is due less to aversion to Brussels or Strasbourg per se than to the public’s association of “more Europe” with a technocratic focus on the single market and the absence of an appealing alternative model.
首先，美国的干预在过去十年里耗费了数万亿美元和数千条人命，却一直在动摇中东，给受影响国家造成了巨大灾难。	First, US interventions, which have cost the country trillions of dollars and thousands of lives over the past decade, have consistently destabilized the Middle East, while causing massive suffering in the affected countries.
欧洲铁路交通管理系统（European Rail Traffic Management System）克服了不同成员国之间安全和安保标准不一致的问题，建立了一个统一的系统。 这只是这一创新性战略所促成的诸多成功例子中的一个。	The European Rail Traffic Management System, which has overcome divergent safety and security standards among member states to create a unified system, is but one of the many successes that this innovative strategy has facilitated.
非理性繁荣的参与者根本没想过如果当局出手维持经济以及信贷流（或者在极端情况下援助银行或者企业）后自己收回多少。	The irrationally exuberant were not thinking of the returns they would garner if the authorities intervened to maintain the economy and the flow of credit (or, in extreme cases, moved to bail out their bank or enterprise).
第一个认为所有真相都是相对的以及所有信息都是一种反映了社会权力关系的宣传的那个人，早已被桑托勒姆及其支持者们排除在了自己的世界之外。	The first people to argue that all truth is relative, and that all information is a form of propaganda that reflects society’s power relations, were far removed from the world inhabited by Santorum and his supporters.
但另外一项远没有那么稳定的世界纪录归属于北极冰本身：截至今年3月，北极冰已经缩减到有记录以来的最小规模。	But another record, this one far less stable, belongs to the Arctic ice itself: by March of this year, it had shrunk to the smallest size ever recorded.
本阿里的女婿 萨克赫尔·马泰（ Sakhr el-Materi ）去年通过选举进入了执政的宪政民主联盟党中央委员会。	Ben Ali’s son-in-law, Sakhr el-Materi, was last year elected to the central committee of the ruling Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique party.

悲观主义者认为增长将变得更为困难和昂贵；乐观主义者则认为这一定律将随着芯片向3D阵列发展而继续有效。	The pessimists claim that this is becoming harder and more expensive; the optimists hold that the law will remain valid, with chips moving to three dimensions.
更强的信号 — — 比如取消或中止南溪（South Stream）输气管道协议、武器贸易禁令或者双管齐下的选择应该得到认真考虑。	Stronger signals, such as cancellation or suspension of agreements concerning the South Stream gas pipeline and a trade embargo on arms and dual-use items, merit serious consideration.

这对于一位伊朗立法者Akbar Alami而言是难以接受的，他曾公开质疑艾哈迈迪内贾德的看法，认为即便是伊斯兰最神圣的人物也从未做过这种声明。	This proved too much for one Iranian legislator, Akbar Alami, who publicly questioned Ahmadinejad’s judgment, saying that even Islam’s holiest figures have never made such claims.
这正是为何美国支持这些国家在国际货币基金组织，20国集团，亚太经合组织等国际机构承担更大作用是如此重要。	That is precisely why it is so important that the US support a greater role for these countries in international institutions such as the IMF, the G-20, and APEC.

他在战斗中的勇敢证明了他的爱国、勇气和坚定，但在他的职业生涯中，却时常表现出判断力的极度匮乏的弊病。	His bravery in combat attests to his patriotism, courage, and toughness, but his judgment has been found sorely lacking time and time again over his career.
如果我们禁止在奥林匹克运动会上服用兴奋剂，那么我们就应该负起责任，奉劝运动员不要做这种傻事、对运动员进行严格检测、并惩罚那些服用了兴奋剂的运动员。	If we prohibit drugs in the Olympic Games, we owe it to the athletes to deter, detect, and punish those who cheat.

对机器人的适度税收，即便是仅仅减缓这类破坏性技术推广的临时税，似乎是一项旨在解决日益严重不平等现象的政策的天然组件。	A moderate tax on robots, even a temporary tax that merely slows the adoption of disruptive technology, seems a natural component of a policy to address rising inequality.
《纽约时报》和《华盛顿邮报》上的报道与直接面向千百万人、在党派电台和电视节目上反复播出的总统的推特比起来根本没有那么重要了。	What appears in The New York Times or the Washington Post matters less than presidential tweets that go straight to millions of people and are echoed in partisan radio or TV shows.

中国是美国国债最大的外国持有者，美国、欧洲、拉丁美洲和澳大利亚的主要贸易伙伴，也是内亚贸易的关键推动者，这部分是因为其巨大的加工贸易规模。	China is the largest foreign holder of US Treasury securities, a major trade partner for the US, Europe, Latin America, and Australia, and a key facilitator of intra-Asian trade, owing partly to the scale of its processing trade.
首先，在过去四十年中塑造了多项经济政策的简单化新自由市场原教旨主义理论是存在严重误导性的，而GDP的增长正是以不平等状况的恶化为代价。	The simplistic neo-liberal market-fundamentalist theories that have shaped so much economic policy during the last four decades are badly misleading, with GDP growth coming at the price of soaring inequality.
类似地，俄罗斯总统普京不再有事实或罪恶的负担，利用国内和国际群众根深蒂固的怨气和不安全感，为其乌克兰政策营造强大的支持声浪。	Likewise, Russian President Vladimir Putin, unburdened by facts or guilt, has taken advantage of domestic and international audiences’ deep-seated resentments and insecurities to craft compelling narratives in support of his policy toward Ukraine.
人们在20世纪60年代创设特别提款权时，就是希望创设这种信用货币，而建立新的国际储备体系的过程必须通过将特别提款权转换成这种全球货币的方式来完成。	This is what was hoped for when SDRs were created in the 1960’s, and this process must be completed by transforming the SDRs into such a global currency.
小泉在这些改革中取得了实质性的成功，使得被假公济私的自民党政客、官僚和商业巨头把持的、运转不灵的日本政府发生了重大转变。	Koizumi had real successes in these reform efforts, which significantly transformed a malfunctioning Japanese state that was in the grip of pork-barrel LDP politicians, bureaucrats, and big business elites.

而且，这一制度体系应能确保政府履行其职责：捍卫公平、坚定透明地执行法律、让最强大竞争者获取应得收益。	Such a PRI would ensure that the state fulfills its responsibility to safeguard justice, enforce the law firmly and transparently, and enable the strongest competitors to reap their just rewards.
世界银行可以更加直截了当地寻求股东批准特别机制 — — “拖欠前清算拨款 ” （ pre-arrears clearance grant ） — —从而让索马里得到IDA融资。	More immediately, the World Bank could seek its shareholders’ approval for a special mechanism – a “pre-arrears clearance grant” – that would enable Somalia to receive IDA financing.

尽管如此，这已经成为眼下最紧迫的宏观经济问题，不但是因为2000年以来家庭和政府债务不断上升，也是因为 — — 也更重要地 — — 政府债务正在引起过多担忧。	Nonetheless, this has become the most urgent macroeconomic question of the moment, owing not just to spiraling household and government debt since 2000, but also – and more important – to the excess concern that government debt is now eliciting.
对美国而言，俄罗斯同样是一个邪恶帝国，是一个共产扩张主义的世界和一个超级核大国，但同时也是科学、精神和灵魂的摇篮。	For America, Russia, too, was an evil empire, the world of communist expansionism and a nuclear superpower, but also a cradle of science, spirit, and soul.

此外，这还需要将制定经济政策的任务委托给那些跨国机构里的技术官僚，这些人完全与政治绝缘 — — 而这一立场又严重限制了民主以及政治问责制度的作用。	Moreover, it would require entrusting economic policy to international technocrats, insulated as they are from the push and pull of politics – a stance that severely circumscribes democracy and political accountability.
真实GDP增长在1998—1999年期间暂时性地下降到7.7 % ， 但在随后的十年中又再次升高到10.3 % 。	Real GDP growth slowed temporarily, to 7.7% in 1998-1999, before reaccelerating to 10.3% in the subsequent decade.

而当弗拉基米尔·普京重新把决定俄罗斯政治和公共事务的大权集中在克里姆林宫的宫墙之内时，他的首要考虑则是如何把各方对他手中中央权力的挑战最小化。	As he revived centralized Kremlin control over Russian politics and public affairs, Vladimir Putin has been concerned primarily with minimizing challenges to state power, which he concentrated in his own hands.
另一些人则关注特朗普作为一个局外人的魅力，竟能够以一种其对手 — — 近乎无懈可击的圈内人前国务卿希拉里 — — 永远不可能做到的方式来搅乱整个政治体系。	Others focus on Trump’s appeal as an outsider, capable of disrupting the political system in a way that his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton – a consummate insider – never could.

寻租 — — 即富贵精英把资源分配给自己、扼杀其他阶层成功机会的能力 — — 毫无例外地会导致竞争性不足的市场和萎靡的增长。	Rent-seeking, the ability of entrenched elites to allocate resources to themselves and smother opportunity for others, invariably leads to a less competitive market and lower growth.
有些欧洲国家的政府，特别是巴黎和伦敦，也可能存在将哈马斯纳入巴勒斯坦政治的压力 — — 在巴黎和伦敦，有人甚至在战争爆发前就表示反对孤立哈马斯。	Pressure to integrate Hamas into Palestinian politics is also likely in some European capitals, particularly Paris and London, where some expressed opposition to isolating Hamas even before the war.
例如，在2015年，国有的俄罗斯国家电视一台（Rossiya 1）所播出的一部纪录片指责人权活动人士库特波娃犯有工业间谍罪，这样的谎言最终导致她被迫流亡。	For example, in 2015, a documentary that aired on state-owned Rossiya 1 accused human-rights activist Nadezhda Kutepova of “industrial espionage,” lies that eventually forced her into exile.

进入劳务市场的人数要比同时期的退出人数高200，000到300，000¾而移民还未被计算在内，虽然近年来的移民数量有所减少，但仍然是寻找工作的主要力量。	In France, by contrast, 200,000 to 300,000 more people enter the labor market than leave it in each generation – and this does not include immigration, which, although slowing recently, represents a large number of job seekers.
专注一其中一个部分（比如可贸易部门的竞争力问题）而排除另一个（也许是严重的不可贸易需求短缺或绝对生产率停滞不前）是不够的。	Focusing on one (say, the competitiveness problem in the tradable sector) to the exclusion of the other (perhaps a serious non-tradable demand shortfall or stagnant absolute productivity) will not be enough.
借用法兰西共和国的信条“自由、平等、博爱 ” ， 其中的首要原则自由成为1989年柏林墙倒塌后我们这个时代的座右铭；而今天随着经济状况的摇摇欲坠，排在第二位的“平等”正在得到越来越多的重视。	In terms of the French Republic’s credo, “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,” the first principle, liberty, became the motto of our age after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989; the second is gaining greater precedence today as the economy falters.
如果这种令人不满意的发展再持续15 到 20年，墨西哥就会变成一个像葡萄牙、希腊或波兰这样的下层中产阶级国家。	Given 15 to 20 more years of this unsatisfactory progress, Mexico will become a lower-middle class country like Portugal, Greece, or Poland.
但如今大部分公众看到的却是在同一批精英们掌控下的大银行和大国政府，是这些人制造了危机，却又巧立名目用纳税人的钱去拯救那些银行。	Today, by contrast, broad segments of the public see the big banks and big government as being run by the same elites who created the crisis, and then spent public money under one guise or another bailing the banks out.

布什总统不久前任命的美国驻联合国大使，激进的反联合国外交家约翰·博尔顿所提出的战略引起了人们的广泛关注，这种关注也确实恰如其分。	A great deal of attention has been paid to the stratagems of John Bolton, the fiercely anti-UN diplomat whom President Bush recently appointed US ambassador to the UN, and rightly so.
叙利亚不是利比亚，而且现在的政治环境也有了显著的变化 — — 美国总统大选近在眼前，欧洲又面临着日益恶化的经济危机。	Syria is not Libya, and the political context has changed significantly, with America’s presidential election approaching and a deepening economic crisis in Europe.

法国前外长于贝尔·韦德里纳（Hubert Vedrine）最近估算说只有15~20％的欧洲人是亲欧派，还有15~20％的人一贯反对欧盟，剩下的60％是“欧元过敏症患者 ” — —这一描述虽然粗略，但还算公允。	As Hubert Vedrine, a former French foreign minister, recently estimated that only 15-20% of Europeans are Europhiles, another 15-20% oppose the EU outright, and the remaining 60% are “euro-allergic.” It is a rough but fair portrait.
因此，当日后危机来袭时，金融稳定论坛表现得有待加强，2009年二十国集团政府决定采取更严格的模式 — — 金融稳定委员会（Financial Stability Board ） 。	So when the next crisis hit, the FSF was found wanting, and in 2009 the G-20 governments decided that a tougher model was needed – the Financial Stability Board.

只要人人影响平等，甘愿接受现状的心态让日本安然度过了二十年的通缩，民众并没有因为当局始终无法解决通缩问题而怨声载道。	This willingness to accept a situation, however bad, as long as it affects everyone equally is what enabled Japan to endure two decades of deflation, without a public outcry over the authorities' repeated failure to redress it.
而我们也不能排除，星期天最突出的统计数字（57 % ！ ）不仅仅意味着行将就木的昨天的政治机器（它们明天可能再度崛起的民粹主义政党）最后的苟延残喘。	And we cannot rule out that Sunday’s most salient statistic (that 57%!) signifies not only the last gasp of the supine corpses that had been yesterday’s political apparatus (and that may rise again to become tomorrow’s populist parties).
事实上，当年是伊朗第一个提出让卡尔扎伊领导新成立阿富��政府，而且在2002年初的第一个阿富汗捐助国会议上，哈塔米政府还承诺在5年内为阿富汗提供5.6亿美元的援助。	Indeed, it was Iran that first suggested that Karzai lead the newly formed Afghan government, and Khatami’s government pledged $560 million in assistance over five years at the first donor conference for Afghanistan in early 2002.
许多这样的冒险都会以失败告终；但是 — — 特别是在美国 — — 这些股权融资的快速成长公司备受推崇。	Many such ventures do not pan out; but – particularly in the United States – such equity-financed rapid-growth companies are strongly encouraged.
但梵蒂冈银行又称为宗教工作研究所（Institute for Works of Religion ） ， 它成立于1942年，并无多深的天主教根基。	But the bank known as the Institute for Works of Religion, founded in 1942, does not have deep roots in Catholicism.
对台军售，藏独势力以及各类“颜色革命”都是美国以及其他西方势力背后资助的，而且唯一例外是为了削弱中国。	Arms sales to Taiwan, Tibetan activism, and “color revolutions” of various kinds are all sponsored by the US and other Western powers, and are aimed at weakening China.
但是，作为欧洲对其最重要的邻邦政策的一个重要组成部分，巴塞罗那进程的成功是有限的：一个好主意要实行起来有点困难。	But, as a significant component of Europe’s policy toward its most crucial neighbors, the successes of the Barcelona Process were modest: a great idea on the launch pad had difficulty getting off the ground.
在十九世纪，大部分地缘政治对手都围绕着谁能控制被摇摇欲坠的奥斯曼帝国统治的土地这一“东方问题”展开。	In the nineteenth century, much of geopolitical rivalry revolved around the “Eastern Question” of who would control the area ruled by the crumbling Ottoman Empire.
囿于现金的朝鲜可能向出价最高者兜售核武器，买家可能是恐怖组织，也可能是同样认为自己需要这一终极武器的国家。	A cash-strapped North Korea might be tempted to sell nuclear arms to the highest bidder, be it a terrorist group or some country that decided that it, too, needed the ultimate weapon.
而8国的另外4个¾斯洛文尼亚、波兰、立陶宛和斯洛伐克¾都具备直选总统，但从政治和宪法的角度却没有一个能与库奇马领导的乌克兰相媲美。	The other four - Slovenia, Poland, Lithuania, and Slovakia - have directly elected presidents, but none comes constitutionally and politically close to Kuchma's Ukraine.
如果他接受了这一方案，那么将使乌克兰这个渴望成为欧盟成员国并且现在正在与欧盟谈判自由贸易协定的国家获得它所需要的稳定、高效和民主的政府。	If accepted, it promises Ukraine, which aspires to EU membership and is currently negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with the Union, the stable, effective, and democratic government that it needs.
不管英国脱欧和美国大选结果如何，很有可能西方民主国家政府将对选民的焦虑做出反应，采取回归某种程度的保护主义的措施。	Regardless of how Brexit or the US election plays out, it is very likely that governments in Western democracies will respond to voter angst and take measures that imply a return to some degree of protectionism.
我们需要小心（比如）人口增长和消费水平的代际后果，也要小心我们如何对待自己将影响我们子辈和孙辈的生活方式的机会。	We need to be aware for example, that population growth and rising consumption levels have intergenerational consequences, and that how we conduct ourselves will affect the lifestyles and opportunities of our children and grandchildren.
但在中国，国家主席习近平邀请美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在北京故宫举行国宴打破了克里姆林宫期待与中国深化伙伴关系的期望 — — 这样一种礼遇任何苏联或俄罗斯领导人都从未享受过。	But the Kremlin’s hope of a deeper partnership with China was dashed when Chinese President Xi Jinping invited US President Donald Trump to a state dinner in Beijing’s Forbidden City – an honor never extended to a Soviet or Russian leader.
欧洲领导人必须寻求有控制地分割欧元区，最具竞争力的国家 — — 奥地利、芬兰、德国和荷兰 — — 应该采用新货币“北欧元 ” 。	Europe’s leaders must pursue a controlled segmentation of the eurozone, in which the most competitive countries – Austria, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands – adopt a new currency, the “northern euro.”
冷战的结束也终结了美国支持背后的外交政策逻辑，而贸易和投资的日益全球化让支持发展中国家不再是扩大市场的必要手段。	The end of the Cold War undercut the foreign-policy logic behind America’s backing, as increasing globalization of trade and investment made economic support for developing countries seem less necessary as a way to expand markets.
想想非洲，非洲联盟在解决大陆上的争端中正发挥着领导作用，并且越来越坚定地介入和制止侵略，确保对非洲少数民族公平。	Consider Africa, where the African Union is taking a leading role in resolving conflicts on the continent and is increasingly determined to intervene to halt aggression and assure fair play for African minorities.
这些情绪 — — 加之法国政府在促进民族认同和经济发展方面的历史作用 — — 已经导致对国民阵线的支持率激增。	These sentiments – together with the French state’s historical role in fostering national identity and economic growth – have contributed to a surge in support for the National Front.
和戴维·弗罗姆金所写的1914年的德国一样，布什政府把伊拉克战争描述为一场反恐战争 - - 即使伊拉克与恐怖袭击美国毫无关系 - - 以此来操纵美国公众舆论，博得公众的支持。	Just as Fromkin shows with regard to Germany in 1914, the Bush administration manipulated US public opinion to support the Iraq War as a war on terror, even though Iraq had nothing to do with any terrorist attack against the US.
中国需要用上述结构性改革带来的改革红利，包括市场活力和整体经济稳定性增长，来抵消GDP增速放缓的改革成本。	The deceleration in GDP growth that such reforms would cause would be more than offset by increased market dynamism and overall economic stability.
其第五版评估报告围绕“负排放”的概念 — — 即吸收大气中的过多二氧化碳的能力 — — 构建了实现巴黎气候目标的情景。	In its fifth assessment report, it builds its scenarios for meeting the Paris climate goals around the concept of “negative emissions” – that is, the ability to suck excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
欧盟边境管理局、欧盟边防局（Frontex）已经启动名为海卫行动的有限海岸救援计划，以部分弥补地中海救援行动停止后的空缺。	In its place, the EU border agency, Frontex, has begun conducting a limited coastal mission called Operation Triton.
我们也不要忘记，中国还持有大量美国国债，如果压得太猛，它可能会试图破坏美国政府债券市场的稳定，而后者对全球金融体系的健康至关重要。	And let us not forget that China holds a massive volume of US Treasury bonds which, if pushed too hard, it could use to try to destabilize the US government bond market, which is essential to the health of the global financial system.
在作某些声明和最近接受纽约时报托马斯·弗里德曼采访时，奥巴马将伊朗协议与1972年理查德·尼克松向中国开放相比。	In some of his statements, and in his recent interview with Thomas Friedman of the New York Times, Obama compared the deal with Iran to Richard Nixon’s opening to China in 1972.
比如在Kargopol博物馆矗立着一座投掷者的泥塑雕像，是偷窃犯人包裹的看守后代向博物馆捐赠的，雕像的里面灌满了蜂蜜。	In the Kargopol museum, for example, stands a clay pitcher, presented to the museum by the descendants of a guard who appropriated a prisoner's parcel - a pitcher full of honey.
不管经济学家获得如此独特地位的原因何在，诺贝尔奖光环可以也确实常常让有害于公共利益 — — 比如推动不平等和增加造成金融危机的可能性 — — 的政策获得信誉。	Whatever the reason for economists’ unique status, the halo conferred by the prize can – and often has – lend credibility to policies that harm the public interest, for example by driving inequality and making financial crises more likely.
但气候变化对非洲的打击却最大，因为它严重影响到非洲大陆脆弱的农业部门，而农业部门养活了70%的非洲人口。	Yet climate change will hit Africa hardest, because it will cripple the continent’s vulnerable agricultural sector, on which 70% of the population depends.
因此，尽管对于让伊朗永久放弃核野心方面，美国显然比以色列有更好的条件发动战争，但美国极有可能认为这一目标实在成本太高。	As a result, the US, though certainly better equipped than Israel for a war to ensure that Iran forever abandons its nuclear ambitions, could nonetheless conclude that that objective is simply too costly.
尽管墨西哥出口比拉丁美洲其他所有国家的总和还要多，但其出口部门的效率提高被系统性地引导资源进入使用无薪工人的低生产率企业的政策抵消掉了。	Although Mexico exports more than all other Latin American countries combined, its export sectors’ efficiency gains have been offset by policies that systematically funnel resources toward low-productivity firms with non-salaried workers.
美联储经济学家团队的一份最新研究认为当前劳动力市场参与率下降几乎完全是因为人口老化和其他结构性原因所致。	A recent study by a team of Fed economists concluded that nearly all of the current decline in the labor-force participation rate reflects the aging of the population and other structural causes.
奇普拉斯也许有些“冲动 ” ， 其中左翼泛希腊社会运动党（Pasok）和中右翼新民主党的竞争对手会如是说，但绝不是非理性的。	Tsipras might be “impetuous,” as his mainstream adversaries from the center-left Pasok and the center-right New Democracy would say, but he is not irrational.
此外，世界 — — 不仅是西方世界，也包括俄罗斯和中国 — — 也将面临全球性的毒品、军火和恐怖行动扩散的危险。	Moreover, the world – not just the West, but Russia and China as well – would risk global proliferation of drugs, weapons, and terror.
中国的市场准入和知识产权保护记录劣迹斑斑，因此美国应该考虑中国制造2025战略会如何影响美国的利益。	Given China’s spotty record on market access and IP protection, the US is right to consider how the Made in China 2025 strategy will affect American interests.
事实上，欧洲工程的起点乃是，合适的���度、产权和竞争加上增长友好型税收制度和稳健的财政政策构成了经济成功的基础。	Indeed, the European project should start from the premise that appropriate institutions, property rights, and competition, together with a growth-friendly tax system and solid fiscal policies, are the basis of economic success.
就性别挑选而论，不难看出，不同的夫妇分别为自己的子女做出最佳的选择，结果却可能使所有孩子的处境还不如无法挑选子女性别的时候。	In the case of sex selection, it is easy to see that couples who independently choose the best for their own child can produce an outcome that makes all their children worse off than they would have been if no one could select the sex of their child.
Sadr反对封建主义是因为一个什叶派的地方政府会听命于他的敌人，西斯坦尼和SCIRI，并因此（按他的说法）被置于伊朗的影响之下。 为了强调他的讯息，Sadr让他的民兵去攻击Badr民兵。	Sadr opposes federalism because a Shia regional government would obey his enemies, Sistani and the SCIRI, and, he says, fall under Iranian influence.
即使是特朗普政府，也不得不在最终认识到美国的许多来自墨西哥的进口品中包含着大量美国要素时，重新考虑其废除北美自由贸易协定的计划。	Even the Trump administration had to reconsider its plan to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement when it finally realized that a lot of US imports from Mexico have substantial US content.
换句话说，在与东盟打交道时，中国有谈判两次的权利 — — 首先在东盟共同立场形成过程中通过其在东盟的最紧密盟友进行，然后再与所有东盟国谈判。	What this shows is that, in dealing with ASEAN, China gets to negotiate twice – first, through its closest allies within ASEAN in the formulation of common ASEAN positions, and then directly with an ASEAN team that could include one of its allies.
在当时的前现代世界，私人生活令人难以置信地公开化，而十九二十世纪的社会运动极大地拓展了个人隐私和自我定义的领域。	In that pre-modern world, private life was extraordinarily public, whereas the social movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries dramatically expanded the realm of individual privacy and self-definition.
对许多观察家而言，此次投票令人联想起6月的英国退欧公投和美国当选总统唐纳德·特朗普本月早些时候的胜利。	For many observers, the vote invoked the specter of June’s Brexit referendum and US President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier this month.
当我在阅读《海中的恶行：野生捕捞鱼类的福利》这份由fishcount.org.hk网站发布的开创性报告之时，这些童年往事又浮现在了眼前。	These childhood memories flooded back when I read Worse things happen at sea: the welfare of wild-caught fish, a breakthrough report released last month on fishcount.org.uk.
尽管俄罗斯尚未表示愿意放弃对乌俄边境的控制，对美谈判也没有取得什么进展，但普京显然知道现状是不可持续的。	And while Russia has not yet expressed a willingness to cede control of the Ukraine-Russia border, nor made progress in talks with the US, Putin surely knows that the status quo is unsustainable.
美国的人均国民收入在2006年（就在大衰退来临前）达到了一个顶峰，而2009年时的数据仍然比这一峰值要低5 ％ 。	US per capita national income peaked in 2006, just before the Great Recession, and was still 5% below that point in 2009.
因此我们竭尽全力鼓励多位经济学家（包括斯蒂格利茨）对合适的规模做出更大的估计，我为奥巴马所准备的简报备忘录反映了这一点。	So we worked to encourage a variety of economists, including Stiglitz, to offer larger estimates of what was appropriate, as reflected in the briefing memo I prepared for Obama.
然而，尽管权威人士大谈资产负债表如何如何健康，但企业债务水平（相对应于资产和净值来说）也处于历史最高点附近。	And yet, despite what pundits claim about strong balance sheets, firms’ debt levels, relative to assets and net worth, also remain near record-high levels.
实际上国际足联禁止直接和间接对该赛事的所有收入进行征税，涵盖所有大陆足球联盟，东道国广播公司，国际足联成员协会，服务提供商和承包商。	In fact, FIFA prohibits both direct and indirect taxation on all income from the event, exempting continental soccer confederations, host-country broadcasters, and FIFA member associations, service providers, and contractors.
封建主义没过多长时间就开始瓦解；自由和民主价值观逐渐兴起；妇女获得了更多权利；同时出现了提高生产效率、实现高增长和改善生活水平的经济体系。	It was not long before feudalism began to dissolve; liberal and democratic values gained traction; women secured greater rights; and economic systems emerged that could boost productivity, achieve high growth rates, and improve living standards.
作为德国政府主持撰写的报告《一条欧洲新增长路径》的合著者，笔者很抱歉在本已众说纷纭而又互为补充的绿色增长前景预测方面又增添了一把声音。	As a co-author of A New Growth Path for Europe, a report commissioned by the German government, I am guilty of contributing to this cacophony of complementary perspectives on green growth.
虽然这一数字较2012~14年期间的61.2％低点有所反弹，但比1980年后的平均64.6％的水平低两个百分点。	While that represents a bit of a rebound from the 61.2% low recorded in the 2012-2014 period, it is two percentage points below the post-1980 average of 64.6%.
（此外，在法国，由马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）领导的极右翼政党国民阵线（National Front）也在今年12月的第一轮选举中尽显强势，尽管最后没有赢得胜利。 ）	(In France, moreover, the far-right National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, showed its strength in the first round of December’s regional elections, though it eventually failed to win any).
1980~90年代时这三个国家都开始实施开放政策并经历了艰难的结构转型，提高了生产力，也为民众和消费者带来了广泛的益处。	In the 1980s and 1990s, these three countries began to open up, and experienced difficult structural transitions that nonetheless boosted productivity and provided broad-based benefits to citizens and consumers.
慕尼黑 — 《 经济学人 》 （ The Economist）最近报道说，德国的经常项目盈余太高了。 这是对的。	MUNICH – The Economist was right when it recently reported that Germany’s current-account surplus is too high.
但他们也密切跟进美国的政治，而在这些天来，许多人认为，领导层飘忽不定的风险已不再是金氏王朝所独有的现象。	But they also follow American politics closely, and these days, many regard the dangers of erratic leadership as no longer being confined to Kim’s regime.
这一死胡同战略将以与德国的徒劳博弈和绝望的经济实验为特征，比如以实质强制性的国民储蓄为政府债务融资。	This dead-end strategy will feature vain attempts to game Germany and desperate economic expedients, such as the essentially coercive capture of domestic savings to finance government debt.
而所有这些“改进”都伴随着其他几十个变化，造成了一场管理制度上的大混乱，既导致带宽紧张，又考验了执行的决心。	And all of these “improvements” followed dozens of other changes, creating a maelstrom of bureaucracy that strained bandwidth and tested resolve.
此外，也许最糟糕的是，恐怖分子和极端分子将学校作为目标，炸毁学校建筑，威胁学校教师，在巴基斯坦北部尤其猖獗。	And, perhaps worst of all, terrorists and extremists have been targeting schools, blowing up their buildings and threatening their teachers, particularly in the northern part of the country.
东非、南非、泰国和美国的393例临床试验产生了令人鼓舞的免疫原性反应和“有利的安全性和耐受性”指标。	Clinical trials involving 393 people in East Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States have yielded encouraging immunogenic responses and a “favorable safety and tolerability” profile.
尽管每个风暴都是一个巨大的威胁，但借助最近的周期性东风，欧洲有望各个击破三大危机，不会引起比暂时性扰动更严重的后果。	Though each poses a considerable threat, Europe, aided by the recent cyclical pickup, is in a position to address them individually, without risking more than a temporary set of disruptions.
丹麦向联合国大陆架边界委员会（United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf）递交了它的主张，加入了现时代的“大博弈 ” ： 争夺北极圈大部的经济控制权。	By filing its claim with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, Denmark has joined our era’s “great game”: the contest for economic control over a large part of the Arctic.
上个月，马来西亚最高法院驳回了反对派领袖安瓦尔·易卜拉欣（Anwar Ibrahim）对其五年有期徒刑、剥夺五年政治权利的判决的上诉 — — 这一决定令人震惊，毫无道理可言。	In Malaysia, the country's highest court last month rejected opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's appeal against a five-year prison sentence and a ban against running for public office for a further five years – a shocking and indefensible decision.
它们的利润被私人化，而任何超出它们的股本的损失被推给了债权人或者 — — 更妙的是 — — 推给了纳税人。	Their profits are privatized, but any losses exceeding their equity are dumped on their creditors, or, even better for them, on the taxpayers.
当然，格鲁吉亚总统米哈伊尔·萨卡什维利(Mikhail Saakashvili)有时可能确实显得轻率自私、傲慢自大，但如果俄国惩罚他的政策最终导致格鲁吉亚局势失控，那么俄国必须为此付出代价。	Of course, Georgia’s President Mikhail Saakashvili may at times be thoughtless and arrogant. But if Russia’s policy toward him lets events in Georgia get out of control, Russia will be held accountable.
通过创新，增强卫生体系的动态合作，以及政治意愿，世界能够保持从打击传染病中所获得的收益，并有效地打击NCD。	Through innovation, dynamic partnerships to strengthen health systems, and political will, the world can sustain the gains made against infectious disease, while also effectively combating NCDs.
正如诺贝尔经济学奖得主肯尼斯·阿罗在1972年指出的那样 ， “ 互信的缺失可以解释世界上绝大多数的经济落后 。 ”	As the Nobel laureate economist Kenneth Arrow argued in 1972, “much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.”
显然，在调整教法时，教师会混淆相关性和因果关系；但这些误差很快就会被发现，因为错误的假设不会带来更好的结果。	Clearly, teachers will be confusing correlation with causation when adjusting their strategies; but these errors will be revealed soon enough as their wrong assumptions do not yield better results.
萨缪尔逊是诺贝尔奖获得者、美国经济学家的翘楚：他的著名教科书《经济学 》 （ Economics）在他生前出版了14版，将全世界无数晚辈经济学家引入经济学殿堂。	Samuelson, a Nobel laureate, was the doyen of American economists: his famous textbook, Economics went through 14 editions in its author’s lifetime, introducing future economists worldwide to the rudiments of their craft.
另一方面，国家领导人视难民为临时性居民，可以通过主要为了满足发达经济体的具体劳动力市场需要而制定的单边或双边协定，用权宜之计来管理。	On the other hand, country leaders saw migration as something temporary that could be managed ad hoc, through unilateral or bilateral agreements primarily designed to fill specific labor-market needs in developed economies.
利用这个方法我们就有机会阐明：许多西方经济体乃至全球经济的未来，都将由它们拿捏金融、经济，社会和政治这四个互联驱动因素的能力来塑造。	Using this approach, it is possible to argue that the future of many Western economies, and that of the global economy, will be shaped by their ability to navigate four inter-related financial, economic, social, and political dynamics.
总的来说，所有承担企业社会责任的行为都应该由企业自己来决定，正如个人社会责任让每个个人依靠自己的良知和感觉来进行判断，决定哪些事情是值得支持和赞助的一样。	All these rationales for CSR suggest that it should be left to each corporation to determine, just as PSR leaves altruism to each individual’s conscience and sense of what needs supporting.
开罗，已故的伟大历史学家托尼·朱特（Tony Judt）在其身前最后的文章之一提出了我们应该从过去的一个世纪中学到什么的问题。 在过去的一个世纪中，如此之多的士兵和平民在冲突中丧生。	CAIRO – In one of his last essays, the late, great historian Tony Judt asked what we should have learned from the last century, a period in which so many soldiers and civilians died in conflict.
虽然独立的央行在帮助该地区在过去20年里实现宏观经济稳定中发挥了至关重要的作用，但和选举机构一样，它们也正受到日益强大的压力。	Although independent central banks have been crucial in helping the region achieve macroeconomic stability over the past two decades, they, like electoral authorities, are being subjected to increasing pressure.
这表明学前教育能够定性地提高儿童的社交技能或情商开发，使他们在随后的生活中拥有抓住更好经济机会方面的优势。	This suggests that preschool provides a qualitative boost to children’s social skills or emotional development that enables them to take better advantage of economic opportunity later in life.
与此同时，由于支持屠夫巴沙尔，俄罗斯在中东 — — 包括具有战略重要性的土耳其 — — 也越来越不受欢迎。	In the meantime, Russia is increasingly loathed across the Middle East, including in strategically important Turkey, for backing the murderous Assad.
许多人相信，经济之所以恢复，完全是因为政府为了二战所做的开支，许多人担心，随着战争的结束，经济会回归萧条。	Many believed that the economy recovered only because of government spending on World War II, and many feared that with the end of the war, the economy would return to its doldrums.
经济学家可能警告说，在美国经济已经接近充分就业的情况下，特朗普的保护主义、大幅减税以及不受控制的政府借贷将助长通胀压力。	Economists may warn that the combination of Trump’s protectionism, big tax cuts, and uncontrolled government borrowing, coming at a time when the US economy is already near full employment, will ultimately fuel inflationary pressure.
但在缺乏一场重大意外冲击的情况下，石油企业将继续被迫低价卖油油，因为它们得努力偿还高油价时进行投资所欠下的债务。	But, in the absence of a major unexpected shock, oil companies will remain under pressure to continue selling oil, even at low prices, as they struggle to service the large debts they incurred on investments when oil prices were high.
大萧条残酷地显示当房地产估值飙升、家庭债务快速增长期过去，家庭部门在房价下跌的同时竭力去除杠杆，经济��能因此进入灾难性的阶段。	As the Great Recession grimly illustrated, when a period of soaring real-estate valuations and rising household debt is followed by a period of falling prices, and households attempt to deleverage, the results can be catastrophic.
对此中国如何进行贸易操作肯定存在一些合理的担忧，包括前世贸组织总干事帕斯卡·拉米（Pascal Lamy）所谓的“对高科技产品进行的不透明，贸易扭曲性的补贴 ” 。	There are definitely valid concerns about how China conducts trade, including what Pascal Lamy, a former WTO director-general, calls “opaque, trade-distorting subsidization of high-tech products.”
我们已经明确了各政府机构制定政策的指导方针，建立了各机构间的协调构架，确定了服务和提供服务的全新渠道。	We have defined guidelines for shaping policy across government, and we have started to create structures for coordinating among government entities and for defining new approaches to services and service delivery.
他长期构思的欧洲演讲虽然不乏大家一致认可的观点，但也为长期激烈的争论埋下了伏笔 — — 而且此次争论的范围并不仅限于英国。	His long-gestating speech on Europe, although containing elements that many might share, also sows the seeds for a prolonged and acrimonious debate – and not just in Britain.
类似地，特朗普签署鼓励美国和台湾之间的正式访问的《台湾旅行法》后，中国进行了针对台湾的军事演习，并贿赂多米尼加共和国与台湾政府断绝外交关系。	Likewise, after Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages official visits between the US and the island, China staged war games against Taiwan and bribed the Dominican Republic to break diplomatic ties with the Taiwanese government.
过于严格的条件标准可能阻止最需要这种援助的成员国申请援助，但是过于宽松的标准又可能使潜在的援助使用者蒙上污名。	Overly strict qualification criteria are likely to deter members that may need this kind of support most from applying for it; but overly loose criteria may stigmatize potential users.
只要欧元区系统性风险得不到解决，主权违约可能性就不到消除，这将导致银行援助计划不断膨胀，造成不可接受的代价。	So long as the eurozone’s systemic risk is not addressed, sovereign defaults are not unlikely, leading to extended bank bailouts that could carry unacceptable costs.
走投无路的美国总统特朗普可能会转而使用世界各地独裁者都最喜欢的策略：制造外交政策危机以分散公众对本土问题的注意力。	A cornered President Donald Trump is likely to turn to a favorite tactic of autocrats everywhere: manufacturing foreign-policy crises to distract the public’s attention from problems at home.
伊拉克难民是一场不容忽视的危机：国际社会必须为该地区的国家减轻负担，同时为更多的最无助的伊拉克人提供重新安置的机会。	The Iraqi refugees are a crisis that cannot be ignored: the international community must alleviate the burden on the countries in the region, while offering resettlement opportunities to many more of the most vulnerable Iraqis.
虽然奥巴马已经接见了墨西哥总统费利佩·卡尔德龙 (Felipe Calderón ) ， 但是，白宫直到最近才宣布奥巴马的首次国外访问会是出访墨西哥，这是具有象征意义的。	It is emblematic that while Obama has received Mexican President Felipe Calderón, the White House only recently announced that one of his first foreign trips would be to Mexico.
年轻人们将参加卢旺达人的婚礼和葬礼，品尝卢旺达食物，学习一些当地语言 ，这些都是了解卢旺达人价值观的钥匙。	The young men and women will attend Rwandans’ weddings and funerals, learn to prepare and enjoy their foods, and acquire some of their language, the portal through which to view their sturdy values.
欧洲的紧缩派 — — 诺贝尔经济学奖得主保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）这样称呼他们 — — 输掉了这场争论。	Europe’s austerians, as the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman likes to call them, lost the argument.
作为STRIDE的一部分，旁遮普和开博尔-普什图省的180所学校加入了第二批学校，节约了大约1,200万美元建设成本。	As part of STRIDE, 180 schools in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have added a second shift, saving around $12 million in construction costs.
接着是这样的 ： “ 他来到工友们中间，说 ： ‘ 死于机器 ’ / 它们践踏了我们的未来，碾碎了我们的梦想 。 ”	And then: “He turned to his workmates and said: ‘Death to Machines’/They tread on our future and stamp on our dreams.”
施密特从1969年到1972年任德国国防部长、1972年到1974年任财政部长，1974年到1982年任联邦总理一职。	Schmidt was the country’s defense minister from 1969 to 1972, finance minister from 1972 to 1974, and federal chancellor from 1974 to 1982.
在“伊克斯托克”泄漏事件中，墨西哥石油公司采用上述方法（目的是尽可能压低损失数据）估算泄漏总量不足50万吨。	In the Ixtoc case, using such methods, Pemex (wanting to keep the loss figure low) estimated the spill to amount to a little under a half-million tons.
如今，在美国危机发生的20个月之后，从 2008年夏天开始，全球经济形势变得不可收拾，V型的观点不攻自破。 这也是美国乃至全球60年以来最糟糕的一次经济危机。	Today’s consensus among economists is that the recession is already over, that the US and global economy will rapidly return to growth, and that there is no risk of a relapse.
公民建军权已经过时，因此如今搬出第二修正案的持枪者捍卫的只是个人枪支拥有权，看起来好像这样能够提供抵御暴政的保护。	Since citizens’ militias are anachronistic, gun owners now use the second amendment merely to defend individual gun ownership, as if that somehow offers protection against tyranny.
巴黎 — — 今年6月，巴林、埃及、利比亚、马尔代夫、沙特阿拉伯、阿拉伯联合酋长国和也门等国切断了与卡塔尔的外交和经济联系。	PARIS – This June, Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, the Maldives, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen cut diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar.
慈善组织对于这些问题没有准备这一事实告诉他们二人，其他捐助者和基金会或多或少都是在没有做出支持谁的明智决定所需要的信息的情况下盲目捐款。	The fact that charities were unprepared for such questions indicated to Karnofsky and Hassenfeld that other donors and foundations give more or less blindly, without the information needed to make sound decisions about whom to support.
过去30年来，美国的收入不平等增长非常显著；实际上，美国目前的收入不平等程度在经合组织国家中仅次于智利、墨西哥和土耳其排名第四。	During the past three decades, income inequality in the United States has increased significantly; indeed, the US now has the fourth-highest level of income inequality in the OECD, behind Chile, Mexico, and Turkey.
有人或许会认为这种增长是合理的，因为标准普尔500指数报告的每股实际季度收益基本上在同期（从2009年第一季度到2018年第二季度）也上涨了3.8倍。	One might think the increase is justified, given that real quarterly S&P 500 reported earnings per share rose 3.8-fold over essentially the same period, from the first quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2018.
中国的能源改革成功与否事关重大，尤其是该国打造世界最大可再生能源发电系统的努力 — — 中国的雄心超出所有人的想象，西方做出的努力根本无法与之相比。	Much depends on the success of China’s energy reforms, and in particular on its efforts to build the world’s largest renewable power system – an ambition far larger than anything imagined, much less attempted, in the West.
诺贝尔奖得主埃里诺·奥斯特罗姆（Elinor Ostrom）的研究成果表明我们可以用给予而非索取的反向策略来解决社会困局。	Following insights by the Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom, we know that social dilemmas can be solved using the inverse strategy: giving instead of demanding.
特朗普誓言要将制造业职位“带回”美国，但如果让美国企业可以更顺利地在中国进行制造和创新，又怎么实现这一承诺呢？	Trump vows to “bring back” manufacturing jobs to the US. How does making it easier for American companies to manufacture and innovate in China contribute to fulfilling that promise?
悲剧在于，从人道角度看，这些幻想的代价实在高昂 — — 2014年4月以来，拒不停火已经在东乌克兰造成了超过6,000人死亡 — — 从地缘政治角度看，代价也十分昂贵。	The tragedy is that the price of these illusions has been extraordinarily high in human terms – the ceasefire-defying death toll in eastern Ukraine has risen to more than 6,000 since April 2014 – and dangerously high in geostrategic terms as well.
也许反弹最强烈的的要数法兰西银行行长克里斯蒂安·诺耶尔（Christian Noyer ） ， 他称这份改革方案“不负责任，与欧洲经济的利益南辕北辙 。 ”	Perhaps the strongest reaction came from Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer, who called the proposals “irresponsible and contrary to the interests of the European economy.”
相反，如果继续放任政治失灵让世界经济走向错误的路径，就会导致一系列狭隘的费协作经济衰退对策、更大的不平等性和严重的金融动荡。	The alternate path, onto which continued political dysfunction would push the world, leads through a thicket of parochial and uncoordinated policies to economic recession, greater inequality, and severe financial instability.
持续经济增长以包容性制度为先决条件，因为创新 — — 以及创造性破坏及其所蕴含的不稳定性 — — 取决于包容性制度。	Sustained economic growth presupposes inclusive institutions, because innovation – and the creative destruction and instability that it wreaks – depends on them.
简而言之，汹涌流向美国的资本人为地压低了利率并抬高了资产价格，导致银行和监管标准松懈并且最终造成瓦解。	Simply put, surging capital flows into the US artificially held down interest rates and inflated asset prices, leading to laxity in banking and regulatory standards and, ultimately, to a meltdown.
当经济陷入流动性陷阱时 — — 即需求萎靡，物价停滞或下跌，利率接近于零时 — — 常规宏观经济逻辑不再有效。	When the economy is in a liquidity trap – when demand is deficient, prices are stagnant or falling, and interest rates approach zero – normal macroeconomic logic goes out the window.
奥斯卡·琼森是伦敦国王学院的博士生，专门研究俄罗斯的非军事战争，他告诉我抵御俄罗斯干预如此困难的原因是其手段非常微妙、复杂而且往往具有较高的可信度。	Oscar Jonsson, a doctoral student at King’s College London who specializes in Russian non-military warfare, told me that what makes countering Russian interference so difficult is that the tactics are subtle, sophisticated, and often believable.
去年8月，以色列允许在C区额外派驻7个营和20辆坦克。 可是埃及武装部队一直没有全额派驻部队，甚至懒得将坦克运过苏伊士运河。	Last August, the Israelis permitted an additional seven battalions and 20 tanks in Zone C. But the Egyptian armed forces never brought in the full number of additional troops, and did not even bother to transport the tanks across the Suez Canal.
因此，也为了从欧洲人目前的困难局面中走出并变得更加强大，欧洲领导人必须自信地认定更加一体化、更加无所不能的欧盟是不可阻挡的未来趋势。	For this reason, and in order to emerge stronger from the difficult situation in which Europeans now find themselves, Europe’s leaders must work with the conviction that the future is inexorably linked to a more integrated and more capable Union.
在智利，如今53%的学生在受教育券资助的学校上学（其中许多直到最近才开始转为非盈利性学校 ） ， 尽管常常还需要缴纳额外的学费。	In Chile today, 53% of all children attend voucher-financed private schools (many of them until recently run for profit), despite the top-up fees they often charge.
如果选民拒绝“无协议脱欧”而支持拒绝脱欧，将会有效压制梅的强硬派对手，而她的首相地位也将在2022年大选前得到保护。	If voters rejected “no deal” in favor of no Brexit, May’s hardline opponents would be silenced, and her position as Prime Minister would be secured until the 2022 election.
毕竟，苹果、谷歌和Facebook加起来的价值便已超过1万亿美元，虽然这些公司的初始投资额与之相比根本不值一提。	After all, Apple, Google, and Facebook are jointly worth more than $1 trillion, even though the capital originally invested in them is a minuscule fraction of that.
于是乎，太多的政策制定者和评论家都急于下结论，坚持伊朗就是一意孤行要搞核武器，或者追求一种极为危险的破坏能力。	That said, too many policymakers and commentators have rushed to judgment, insisting that Iran is irrevocably determined to build nuclear weapons, or that it wants a break-out capability that is just as dangerous.
随着10个新的国家在2004年以及另外两个国家在2007年初加入欧盟，联盟的成员国现在已经扩展到了中欧和东欧。	With the accession of 10 new states in 2004 and another two at the beginning of 2007, the Union’s membership now spans central and eastern Europe.
该体系会把集团公司作为一个整体来计算所得收入，然后按照一个反映各业务单元对集团公司总收入的贡献的公式将收入“分配”到各成员国。	Earned income would be calculated on a consolidated basis for the group and then “apportioned” among the member states according to a formula reflecting each business unit’s contribution to overall group income.
我们也可以确定，增加农业产出是否会导致自然资源更加难以管理；或者，扩大可再生能源资源是否会导致干旱地区的水供给耗竭。	And we could determine if increasing agricultural production would make it harder to manage natural resources; or if expanding renewable-energy sources would deplete the water supply in already-arid regions.
它确实诞生于财政紧迫感，但其最大的风险是它最终煽动围绕这一上限本身的政治冲突，而不能促进关于必须做出的艰难的财政选择的深思熟虑。	While born of a real sense of fiscal urgency, the biggest risk is that it will eventually fuel political conflict around the ceiling itself, rather than foster deliberation about the difficult fiscal choices that must be made.
不同于传统智慧，服务业的日益增长是为了满足国内消费需求，并不意味着制造业和资本投资的末日，更不意味着经济增长走到尽头。	Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the growth of services in China to meet domestic demand does not mean the end of manufacturing and capital investment, much less of economic growth.
事实上，战后是自由贸易历史持续时间最长的时期 — — 这是个特别了不起的壮举，因为世界遭遇了大萧条以来最严重的经济衰退。	In fact, the post-war era has been the longest sustained period of trade liberalization in history – a particularly impressive feat, given that the world has just suffered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
日本的人口下降和劳动力队伍萎缩是一个重大长期性挑战 — — 这在安倍要求更多妇女外出工作的呼吁中可见一斑。	Japan’s declining population and shrinking labor force is a major long-term challenge – reflected in Abe’s call for more women to work outside the home.
比如，2013年，三分之一以上的受访中国企业表示难以招聘到熟练工，61%将其归咎于一般就业技能的短缺。	For example, in 2013, more than one-third of the Chinese firms surveyed said that they struggled to recruit skilled workers, with 61% attributing this to a shortage of general employable skills.
今年1月的达沃斯世界经济论坛上，中国新任中央财经领导小组办公室主任刘鹤暗示即将到来的改革将以惊人的速度推进。	At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Liu He, China’s new vice premier for economic policy, hinted that upcoming reforms would be carried out with surprising speed.
因此，指定伦敦和法兰克福人民币清算行的决定实际上只不过是中国促进建立由多种而非一种全球货币组成的国际货币体系的又一步骤。	Thus, the decision to designate renminbi clearing banks in London and Frankfurt is, in effect, one more step by China to foster the emergence of an international monetary system with several global currencies, not just one.
总体上，那里至少有60个这样的对于欧洲部队来说是被“告诫”的行动限制区，不允许指挥官将军队派驻到这些最需要的地方。	Overall, there are at least 60 such operating restrictions – known as “caveats” – on European troops, preventing commanders from deploying military assets where they are most needed.
这一自负的确定并不新鲜 — — 毕竟，美国就是在传教士般的热情下建立起来的 — — 但它们的道德自大是新鲜事。	This overweening certitude is not new – the United States, after all, was founded on missionary zeal – but the ethical arrogance is.
如今，该行业需要跨入二十一世纪，以便满足新建筑的日益增长的需求、填补全世界日益扩大的住房和基础设施缺口。	Now, the industry needs to enter the twenty-first century, so that it can meet increasing demand for new structures and address the world’s growing housing and infrastructure gaps.
但专家的担忧是值得关注的，也是健康的，因为市场永远有效这样的信念只能在有人不完全相信它并且认为可以通过市场择时获利时才正确。	But the experts’ concern is notable and healthy, because the belief that markets are always efficient can survive only when some people do not completely believe it and think that they can profit by timing the markets.
事实上，他们是电网的守护者，负责清理周边植被和修复因野生动物和其他因素造成的损坏情况 — — 并在此过程中学习新技能。	In effect, they are the guardians of the fences, keeping them clear of vegetation and repairing damage caused by wildlife and other factors – and learning new skills in the process.
只要成员国仍拥有完全的主权，投资者就得不到保证。 若欧元区分崩离析，一些国家将拒绝偿付 — — 或拒绝替其他国家偿付。	As long as member states remain fully sovereign, investors cannot be assured that if the eurozone breaks up, some states will not simply refuse to pay – or will not refuse to pay for the others.
关于英国是否保留欧盟资格的全民公决将在2017年年底前进行。 现在的讨论是变革谈判的第一步，欧盟领导人希望通过谈判说服英国选民选择欧洲。	With a referendum on the UK’s continued EU membership set to take place before the end of 2017, the talks are the first step toward negotiating changes which, EU leaders hope, will convince British voters to choose Europe.
毕竟，在公众面前走秀，进行整容，自我陶醉其中 — — 他的朋友西尔维奥•贝卢斯科尼在意大利这样做受到了很好的效果（后来也不是这样了 ） — —不会让俄罗斯人害怕，甚至得不到俄罗斯人的尊重，在俄罗斯，强硬的统治者常常是宠儿。	After all, narcissistic publicity stunts and facelifts – which worked well for his friend Silvio Berlusconi in Italy (until they didn’t) – don’t inspire fear, or even respect, among Russians, where an iron-fisted ruler is always the preferred choice.
但与金大中和卢拉一样，齐普拉斯可以从一些认为“如果他现在说这些措施不可避免，那么确实是别无选择了”的左派中赢得政治支持。	But like Kim and Lula, Tsipras could marshal political support from some on the left who reckon, “If he now says that these measures are unavoidable, there truly must be no alternative.”
其他国家还建立了绿色银行，而90％的私人气候融资投资都被投入到资本所在国的事实则反映了这类银行对本国事务的重点关注。	Other countries have established green banks, whose domestic focus reflects the fact that 90% of private climate-finance investments are made within the capital’s country of origin.
但是，如果金融体系的堤坝倒塌了，我们可能会经受十年严重的通货紧缩，并使扩张性的经济刺激措施起不到任何作用。	But if the financial system’s dykes collapse, we may be headed for a decade of severe deflation, rendering expansionary stimulus useless.
因此，也许裕仁一直在寻求表达自己的观点：日本应该避免与美国开战，特别是已经与中国进行了四年多残酷又不成功的征服战的情况下。	Thus, Hirohito might have been seeking to express his view that Japan should avoid a war with the US, especially given that the country had been fighting a savage and unsuccessful war of conquest in China for more than four years.
此外，日本和中国一样，深受儒家文化影响。 19世纪、20世纪中国很多改革者都怪罪儒家文化，认为是这种文化严重阻碍了他们自己国家的发展和现代化进程。	Moreover, like China, Japan was a society steeped in Confucian culture, which many Chinese reformers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries blamed as a critical impediment to their own country’s development and modernization.
始于2001年的所谓的反恐战争最终演变成动摇整个中东、危害人民的自由、破坏人民的安全、改变他们的社会的性质的残酷的冲突。	The so-called War on Terror that began in 2001 has evolved into multiple brutal conflicts that are destabilizing the entire Middle East, eroding people’s freedoms, undermining their safety, and transforming the very nature of their societies.
俄石油就是最好的例子，2013年它借贷大约400亿美元b用于收购竞争对手秋明-英石油（TNK-BP ） 。	The best example is Rosneft, which borrowed about $40 billion in 2013 to buy its competitor, TNK-BP.
毕竟，我们目前面临的实际问题就是经济瘫痪。 不确定性使得公司(更高的产量) 和消费者 (公司生产的产品) 都推迟了开支决定。	After all, the real problem that we are currently facing is one of paralysis: uncertainty has placed many spending decisions – by businesses (on higher output) and by consumers (on the items that businesses produce) – on hold.
在已经进行了15年 — — 并且还没有完成 — — 的过程中，35个高负债穷国的债务获得了豁免，其代价超过1,000亿美元。	In a process that has already taken 15 years – and remains unfinished – the debts of 35 highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs) have been forgiven, at a cost of more than $100 billion.
如果印度像如今的欧洲那样各自为政、权力分散，那么它可能从迈向这个方向的步骤中获利，尽管欧洲本身正挣扎着想要集中化。	As dysfunctional as a decentralized Europe seems to be these days, India might benefit from moving a few steps in that direction, even as Europe itself struggles to become more centralized.
比如，联合利华拒绝了资本市场的短期压力 — — 不再公布盈利季报，扩大其注意力以推进更大的社会利益，而不仅仅着眼于股东利益。	For example, Unilever has rejected the short-term pressures of capital markets by ending quarterly earnings reporting and broadening its focus to advance greater social interests, rather than just the interests of its shareholders.
这个前车之鉴触目惊心地说明了，政府及其财政会在一夜之间变得何其脆弱，而不适当的财政政策会成为稳定性货币政策多么大的绊脚石！	That precedent should serve as a warning of how vulnerable governments and their finances can rapidly become, and of how fiscal policy can stand in the way of a monetary approach oriented toward stability.
而当赫尔岑写下这些文字的时候，莫斯科不仅忙于镇压波兰人并确保能继续统治波兰近半个世纪，而且还努力和中国一起瓜分中亚（所谓土耳其斯坦地区 ） 。	When Herzen was writing his words, Moscow was not only busy successfully putting down the Poles, reasserting its rule there for another half-century, but also, together with China, carving up Central Asia, known then as Turkestan.
第一个选择就是通过最低工资法律或者支付社会安置收入来维护低技能者的收入，这就意味着要求私营部门支付最低工资。	The first option is to defend the wages of the low skilled through minimum-wage laws or paying social replacement incomes which imply minimum wage demands against the private economy.
最后，欧洲领导人还可以一读芭芭拉·塔克曼（Barbara Tuchman）的《八月之抢 》 （ The Guns of August，注意标题中的月份 ） 。	Finally, European leaders should consider adding to their book bag Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August (again, notice the month).
为应对这些进步所必须做出的决策 — — 那些与世界的本质或我们自己所创造的事物相关的进步 — — 需要尽可能准确的信息。	The decisions that must be taken in response to these developments – those related to the nature of the world or those we have created ourselves – require as much accurate information as possible.
1994年，乌克兰同意放弃从苏联继承的核武器，以此换取美国、英国和俄罗斯保护乌克兰领土完整和主权的庄严承诺。	In 1994, Ukraine agreed to give up the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the Soviet Union, in return for a solemn commitment by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia to protect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
但是在许多发展中国家，由于不受限制的跨界资本流动和金融市场放松管制，融资变得更加容易，但这些资金却未能流入各类长期性投资领域，特别是制造业。	But in many developing countries, easier access to finance – owing to unrestricted cross-border capital flows and financial-market deregulation – still has not led to more financing for long-term investments, particularly in manufacturing.
第二年，大卫·洛克菲勒（David Rockefeller）和兹比格纽·布热津斯基（Zbigniew Brzezinski）建立了三方委员会，每年一次开会讨论这一问题。	The following year, David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski created the Trilateral Commission, which meets once a year to discuss such problems.
从那以后，政府已经设立了一个违反宪法规定的全权制宪委员会，取消了三大主要反对党，解雇了民选市长和代表，并窃取了三次选举成果。	Since then, the government has installed an unconstitutional Constituent Assembly with full powers, deregistered the three main opposition parties, sacked elected mayors and deputies, and stolen three elections.
第二个理由可能是，即使通胀预期被锚定（因此价格稳定 ） ， 决策者也不知道如何在保持其锚定状态的同时提振经济的支出流。	The second reason might be that even with anchored inflation expectations (and thus price stability), policymakers do not know how to keep them anchored while boosting the flow of spending in the economy.
此外，美国应当鼓励朝鲜做出关键让步 — — 例如，甚至是在完全、可验证及不可逆转的无核化完成之前，允许国际核查人员对其整个核计划展开侵入性核查。	Moreover, the US should reward critical concessions by North Korea – for example, permission to conduct intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear program by international inspectors – even before the completion of CVID.
现任欧盟高级代表凯瑟琳·阿什顿（Catherine Ashton）继续证明着欧盟外交政策机构的价值，比如，她牵线促成了塞尔维亚和科索沃之间的重要和平协议，在对伊朗核谈判方面也起到了关键作用。	Current EU High Representative Catherine Ashton continues to prove the worth of EU foreign-policy institutions by, for example, brokering a remarkable peace between Serbia and Kosovo and playing a key role in nuclear negotiations with Iran.
由负责内部市场和服务的欧盟委员巴尼尔（Michel Barnier）提出的最新方案便是实施这一办法的努力。	The recent proposal by Michel Barnier, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services, is an effort to implement this solution.
儒教的原则在后儒教时代的东亚仍然为人们提供着内在的指引，正如《圣经》的训诫仍然是后宗教时代的西方不可或缺的标准一样。	Confucianism’s tenets still provide an inner compass to most East Asians in a post-Confucian age, just as Biblical admonitions remain standards for the West in a post-religious age.
正是在这样的背景下 — — 巨大的人口竞争极少数专业学院学位 — — 科塔补习班这样的机构得以兴盛。	It is in this context – with a huge population competing for a tiny number of seats in professional colleges – that coaching institutes like those in Kota thrive.
有一些经济学家，尤其是奥地利人哥特弗里德·哈勃勒（ Gottfried Haberler ）曾经构想了一套替代方案：由大金融机构和浮动汇率促成持续的资本流动，但是政治上的响应者寥寥。	The alternative of continued capital movements, facilitated by major financial institutions, and flexible exchange rates was set out by a few economists, notably the Austrian Gottfried Haberler, but found no political resonance.
叙利亚、阿富汗和索马里是难民的最大来源，但更多难民来自利比亚、厄立特里亚、中非共和国、南苏丹、尼日利亚和刚果民主共和国。	Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia are the largest sources of refugees, but many more come from Libya, Eritrea, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
卡梅伦用儿童凶杀案侦探桌游作比方说 ： “ 你不需要超级线索（Cluedo）就能知道，有人聚集在图书馆下水道旁边密谋 。 ”	Referring to a children’s murder-detective board game, Cameron declared: “You don’t need a Cluedo set to know that someone has been clubbed with the lead piping in the library.”
2010年6月，在其第一份预算中，财政大臣乔治·奥斯本（George Osborne）警告说 ， “ 希腊是一国不直面其问题的例子，我决心避免这一覆辙 。 ”	In his first budget in June 2010, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne warned that “you can see in Greece an example of a country that didn’t face up to its problems, and that’s a fate I am determined to avoid.”
事实上，在印度政府做出接受外国零售商的决定的同时，法国零售商家乐福宣布将在今年年底关闭其在新加坡的大量业务。	Indeed, the Indian government’s decision to welcome foreign retailers coincided with French retailer Carrefour’s announcement that it will shut down its substantial operations in Singapore by the end of this year.
全球的预防艾滋病计划将花费270亿美元，但是却有巨大的潜在社会利益：这项计划将在2010年之前避免2,800万多的新HIV/AIDS艾滋病病例。	A comprehensive program would cost $27 billion, but the potential social benefits would be immense: avoidance of more than 28 million new cases of HIV/AIDS by 2010.
就连享有盛誉的事实审核员也无法就“给苦难者以慰藉、给舒适者以折磨 ！ ” 这条知名记者箴言的起源达成一致。	Even reputable fact-checkers disagree on the origin of the famous admonition to journalists: “Comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable!”
为了限制劳动力成本的上升，工资被抑制，在过去20年中每年只增加5 % ， 尽管生产率增长年率高达8.5 % 。	In order to cap the rise in labor costs, wages were suppressed, growing by only 5% annually over the last 20 years, even as productivity grew at an annual rate of 8.5%.
自去年12月黄热病病毒在安哥拉首都兼最大城市罗安达现身以来，已经夺走293人的生命，疑似传染病例2,267人。	Since the virus emerged in Luanda, Angola’s capital and most populous city, last December, it has killed 293 people and infected a suspected 2,267.
目前的任务是在代表性社会中引入原型系统，以证明什么是可行的，发现消费者偏好，确定最具吸引力的商业模式，识别并避免意料外结果。	The task now is to introduce prototype systems in representative communities, in order to prove what is possible, discover consumers’ preferences, determine the most attractive business models, and identify and avert unexpected consequences.
2003年美国侵入伊拉克时，许多观察者，特别是阿拉伯世界观察者，认为推翻萨达姆·侯赛因的逊尼派少数群体政权将强化伊朗的地区地位。	When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, many observers, especially in the Arab world, believed that the removal of Saddam Hussein’s Sunni-minority regime would enhance Iran’s position in the region.
当局让国内的货币和财政政策都服从于维持固定汇率—即使是在贬值压力极大的1997-98年亚洲（金融）危机期间。	They subordinated domestic monetary and fiscal policies to maintaining the fixed exchange rate – even during the 1997-98 Asian crisis, despite great pressure to devalue.
坦白说，选举结果只能影响制宪大会200个议席中的80席。 制宪大会将任命总理、政府以及宪法起草委员会。	To be sure, the results will affect only 80 of the 200 seats in the constituent assembly, whose mandate is to appoint a prime minister, government, and a committee to draft the constitution.
与之相比，2004年3月11日发生在西班牙造成200人死亡的恐怖袭击引发了尝试通过与伊斯兰建立理解和和解来消除极端主义思想的“反十字军运动 ” 。	By contrast, the March 11, 2004, terrorist attack on Spain, which left 200 dead, triggered an “anti-crusade” that seeks to disarm extremism by building bridges of understanding and reconciliation with Islam.
但所有共和党候选人都以反对枪支管制措施为豪；事实上，对于允许人们深藏武器进入学校或酒吧，他们一点问题都没有。	And yet all of the Republican candidates are proud of opposing gun-control measures; indeed, they have no problem allowing people to enter a school or a bar bearing concealed weapons.
十位农民负责种竹子，而25位制造者则负责将这些竹子制造成可以在加纳颠簸的道路上骑行或者出口海外的环保型自行车。	Ten farmers grow the bamboo, and 25 builders craft it into environmentally friendly bikes that can be used on Ghana’s bumpy roads or exported overseas.
当喜爱刨根问底的记者对她的政治安排的细节提出质疑的时候，她最有效的防御手段（至少到目前为止）是 ： “ 如果我不是位女性，你根本就不敢提出这样的问题 ！ ”	When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda, her highly effective line of defense (so far!) has been: “You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman!”
拉丁美洲地区最大的国家巴西陷入了严重的政治危机；当今年夏天巴西举办奥运会之际，在任总统罗塞夫很可能需要出庭受审。	Brazil, the region’s largest country, is in the middle of a severe political crisis; the incumbent president, Dilma Rousseff, may well be on trial while the Olympics are being staged in her country later this summer.
类似地，如果欧元区无法通过强化其经济治理结构实现进一步融合，那么欧洲的金融危机还将继续，破坏社会流动性和社会正义。	Likewise, if the eurozone fails to integrate further by strengthening its economic-governance structures, Europe’s ongoing financial crisis will only continue, impeding social mobility and undermining social justice.
劳动者们离开爱尔兰或者希腊并不是因为那里的生产力低下，而是因为只有离开那里，他们才能摆脱掉父母遭受的债务负担。	Workers may leave Ireland or Greece not because their productivity there is lower, but because, by leaving, they can escape the debt burden incurred by their parents.
从历史上看，贸易体系既有极其开放的，也有受规则、关税和非关税壁垒严格限制的，其变迁受自由派或保护主义经济和政治力量的相对优势驱动。	Historically, trade systems have ranged from rather open to severely restricted by rules, tariffs, or non-tariff barriers, driven by shifts in the relative strength of liberalizing or protectionist economic and political forces.
不像布什政府那样被人抓住对科学轻描淡写，这一委员会直截了当地告诉我们说是人类要对地球最近的变暖负责。	Unlike the Bush administration, caught downplaying the science, the IPCC squarely tells us that mankind is largely responsible for the planet’s recent warming.
美国的一些不切实际的慈善家像内格罗蓬特，怀揣着价值100美元的笔记本电脑，指出了真正的问题所在：非洲在技术上远远落后，从而使飞速的跳跃式前进成为可能。	Americans do-gooders like Nicholas Negroponte, with his $100 laptop, have identified the right problem: Africa is way behind technologically and rapid leap-frogging is possible.
日本央行的新行长黑田东彦（Haruhiko Kuroda）已经向市场发出明确的信号，日本央行的目标是在多年的价格零增长之后，让年通胀率保持在2 % 。	Haruhiko Kuroda, the Bank of Japan’s new governor, has sent a clear signal to markets that the BOJ is targeting 2% annual inflation, after years of near-zero price growth.
这一朝向更大的地区一体化的趋势将形成一个独一无二的机会，如果能够建立一些“滩头阵地 ” ， 就有望赢得一整个极为诱人的市场。	This trend toward greater regional integration will offer a unique opportunity to tap an entire highly lucrative market from a few beachheads.
事实上，就连极右翼政党国民阵线（National Front ）领导人马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）一开始也警告反穆斯林的副作用，声称一小撮迷失的年轻人决不能代表大部分法国穆斯林。	Indeed, even Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, initially warned against the dangers of an anti-Muslim backlash, stating that a few lost young men were in no way representative of the majority of French Muslims.
事实上，联合国秘书长潘基文批评伊朗没有在国际原子能机构的新报告认为它寻求持有核武器时保证事实并非如此。	Indeed, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticized Iran for not assuring the world that it is not seeking nuclear arms at a time when the International Atomic Energy Agency has published a new report suggesting that it is.
大部分墨西哥工人仍然在“非正式”企业工作 — — 特别是那些员工得不到薪酬合同的企业 — — 这些企业的生产率只有融入了世界经济的大型现代企业的几分之一。	The bulk of Mexican workers remain employed in “informal” firms – especially firms in which employees are not on salaried contracts – where productivity is a fraction of the level in large, modern firms that are integrated into the world economy.
马里暂时恢复了稳定，但北部的分裂主义的图阿雷格叛军刚刚退出了和平谈判，因此许多专家认为马里冲突重燃和扩大只是时间问题。	Mali may be stable for now, but, with the separatist Tuareg rebels in country’s north having just suspended their participation in peace talks, many experts believe that it is only a matter of time before the conflict there reignites and spreads.
然而展望未来，塞浦路斯不但有能力恢复增长，甚至有可能弥合与岛屿北部土耳其支持的小国间由来已久的分裂。	Looking ahead, however, Cyprus has the means not only to recover, but even to heal its longstanding division with the Turkish-backed statelet in the north of the island.
如果美国对国内消费征税，则将从进口中获得更大收入，让政府能够降低因美国企业的国内和海外销售而产生的所得税。	If the US were to raise taxes on domestic consumption, it would collect more revenue from imports, which would allow the government to cut income taxes stemming from US firms’ domestic and foreign sales.
这一讨论很重要，因为全世界193个国家的政府将在9月齐聚联合国，最终确定2030年世界所要实现的发展目标。	This discussion matters, because the world’s 193 national governments will meet at the United Nations in September to finalize a list of development targets for the world to meet by 2030.
它还有可能改变经济，让欧洲中央银行在下一次欧元危机中无可作为：欧洲央行总是能够击退市场投机，但对来自选民的解体压力毫无反抗之力。	It will also transform economics, by paralyzing the European Central Bank in the next euro crisis: while the ECB can always defeat market speculation, it is powerless against breakup pressures from voters.
但其实英国之所以能在帝国衰落之后依然保持着国际影响力，就是依靠公民的力量以及政策制定者所受到的教育。	Having lost its empire, Britain retains outsized global influence simply because of the power of its civilization and the education absorbed by its decision-makers.
伴随着对恐怖主义的恐慌心理，和对资产股票价格不稳定性的怀疑心理，这些大城市的地理知名度也有回弹趋势。 纽约、巴黎、伦敦这些地方越出名，他们就变得越耀眼而有魅力。	As with fear of terrorism and suspicion of equities, geographical celebrity appears resilient, if not self-reinforcing: the more famous New York, Paris, and London get, the more glamorous they become.
美国 — — 以及全世界 — — 需要通过协商和熟虑制定公共政策，而不是让一个病态日深的人来制定公共政策。	The US – and the world – needs public policy by consultation and deliberation, not one man’s worsening pathology.
通过独特的个人经历，他能够沟通非洲、美洲，甚至亚洲—年幼时他曾在那里的一所穆斯林学校学习—从而重塑美国的世界形象和讯息。	By virtue of his unique personal history, he can bridge Africa, America, and even Asia – where he studied as a young boy in a Muslim school – thereby reviving the universal image and message of America.
但直到视治国如经营企业的特朗普上台后，美国终于有了一位愿意走这条路的领导人，即便这有损于长期以来一直作为美国外交政策基础的价值观。	But it was not until Trump, who views running a country much like running a business, that the US had a leader who was willing to pursue that path, even if it undermined the values that have long underpinned US foreign policy.
更广泛地说，保持军事扩张得到监督、扩大武器贸易条约（Arms Trade Treaty）参与国、改善国防当局间的互相谅解现已成为亚洲所面临的重大问题。	More broadly, keeping military expansion in check, enlarging the number of countries that conclude the Arms Trade Treaty, and improving mutual understanding among national defense authorities are now the paramount issues facing Asia.
巴沙尔-阿萨德总统政权拒绝允许世卫组织进入反叛分子控制地区接种疫苗，并直接导致了2013年小儿麻痹症的流行。	The refusal of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime to allow WHO to carry out vaccination programs in insurgent-controlled areas directly resulted in a polio outbreak in 2013.
批评者不仅对这些成绩视而不见，同时对在苏丹和缅甸问题上的僵局的突破也嗤之以鼻，说这是放弃人权的道德标准。	Critics charge that these accomplishments, as well as efforts to unblock the stalemates in Sudan and Burma, have been achieved at the price of giving up moral clarity on human rights.
美国平均每工人生产率大约为150,000美元，��果墨西哥制造业的收益全部都归因于NAFTA，就相当于333,000个美国工作岗位，还不到总就业岗位的400分之一。	With average US productivity per worker at about $150,000, if Mexico’s manufacturing gain is attributed entirely to NAFTA, this represents about 333,000 US jobs, or less than one out of every 400 jobs in the US.
欧盟还对俄罗斯天然气巨头Gazprom采取了反垄断调查，批评了3月份大选期间的镇压游行过程中所出现的侵犯人权行为。 普京通过这次大选重回总统宝座。	It also launched an antitrust probe against Russian gas giant Gazprom, and criticized human-rights abuses during the crackdown on demonstrations that accompanied the March election that returned Vladimir Putin to the presidency.
尽管以色列在黎巴嫩无功而返，巴勒斯坦流血内讧意味着双方都受挫了，然而，实现突破尽管可能，但依旧是不大可能。	While Israel’s non-victory in Lebanon and the Palestinians’ bloody divisions mean that both sides have been humbled, a breakthrough, though possible, remains unlikely.
损失还包括没有保护世界日益减少的野生物种以及快速衰退的生态系统。 在维持生命服务的意义上，这些都价值数以万亿计美元。	The losses also include failure to conserve the world’s dwindling wildlife and rapidly degrading ecosystems, which are worth trillions of dollars in terms of life-supporting services.
如果我今年为某种商品或服务支付了和去年一样的价格，但这些东西的质量有所改善，那么我的生活水平显然有所提高。	If I pay the same price for some product or service this year as I did last year, but the quality of the product or service is better, my standard of living has increased.
同时，低利率环境下的充分就业可以消灭食利阶层 — — 那些靠利息和租金来存活的人。 适度的财富再分配是凯恩斯经济学理论较为激进的政治理念，但政府的干预也应有一定的限度。	As long as “the state is able to determine the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the instruments [i.e., the capital base] and the basic reward to those who own them,” there is no “obvious case” for further involvement.
今年11月布朗的公民投票将把加州个人所得税的最高税率提高到13.3 % ， 这也是美国各地所得税率的最高值。	Brown’s ballot initiative this November would raise California’s top personal income-tax rate to 13.3%, the nation’s highest.
但让可以互相勾结保护自身集体利益的寡头拥有媒体所有权同样危险 — — 他们的利益可能与社会其他成员截然不同。	But so is ownership of media by oligarchs who can collude with one another to protect their collective interests – interests that may differ sharply from those of the rest of society.
1月15日，瑞士国民银行出人意料地宣布放弃盯住欧元 — — 一个月前它还在重申盯住欧元的承诺 — — 曾经严守纪律的瑞士国民银行已经顾不上时间一致性的信誉要求了。	By unexpectedly abandoning the euro peg on January 15 – just a month after reiterating a commitment to it – the once-disciplined SNB has run roughshod over the credibility requirements of time consistency.
在经济复苏中更宽泛的“改善体验”因素缺位，对经济不平等状况的不满，对国际政治领导人的不信任，以及人们对地方主义的更广泛接纳：这些才是英国大选竞选的主要特征。	The absence of a broader “feel good” factor from economic recovery, resentment of economic inequality, mistrust of national political leaders, and greater faith in localism: these are the main features of Britain’s election campaign.
最新研究表明，电动汽车价格要到2026年才能与混合动力车相当，到2032年才能等同于常规汽车，到时政府补贴总量将达到1000—1500亿欧元。	Recent research indicates that electric cars may reach break-even price with hybrids only in 2026, and with conventional cars in 2032, after governments spend €100-150 billion in subsidies.
美联储和财政部反对着手干预，这显示了他们对于“仅仅保护商业银行是不能拯救金融体系的”这一点上理解得太慢。	The opposition of the Federal Reserve and Treasury to hands-on intervention meant that they were slow to understand that merely ring-fencing the commercial banks could not save the financial system.
美国给伊斯兰民族和伊斯兰世界带来了深重灾难，大量伊拉克平民在这场美国发动的对伊战争中被打死，并且暴力活动还将进一步升级，死亡人数持续上升。	The US is killing massive numbers of Iraqi civilians, embittering the population and the Islamic world, and laying the ground for escalating violence and death.
当大规模杀伤性武器并没有发现时，美国和其微小（而且不断萎缩的 ） “ 自愿联盟”编造了新的理由，即为民主而战。	When weapons of mass destruction were not found, the US and its small (and dwindling) “coalition of the willing” conjured up a new rationale – the struggle for democracy.
某些药品研究人员预计，随着对人类基因组理解不断加深，医生最终可以提前15年到20年预测疾病，并且立即开始预防疾病治疗。	Some drug researchers predict that with continuing advances in understanding the human genome, doctors may eventually be able to predict illnesses 15-20 years in advance, and begin prophylactic treatment immediately.
虽然美国经济面临种种困难，美元以其不可比拟的深度及美国市场良好的流动性一直把持着各国外汇储备的比重。	Despite the trials and tribulations of the American economy, dollar securities remain the dominant form of reserves because of the unparalleled depth and liquidity of US markets.
2010年希腊所获得的IMF资源“特殊待遇”为“累计不超过”该国IMF份额（其对IMF的金融承担额）的600 % 。	"The “exceptional access"" to IMF resources granted to Greece in 2010 was set at a “cumulative limit of 600%"" of the country's IMF quota, a measure of a country's financial commitment to the IMF."
正如盖伊·川琦（Guy Kawasaki）在其关于苹果公司的著作中所明智指出的那样，这个品牌实质上创造了“魅力 ” 。	As brilliantly explained by Guy Kawasaki in his book on the company, the brand essentially created “enchantment.”
可悲的是，我发现克纳委员会报告中最著名的论断 — — “我们的国家正在分裂成为两个社会群体，一个是黑人，一个是白人 — — 既互相隔离又不平等 ” — —在今天依然有效。	Sadly, the Kerner Commission report’s most famous line – “Our Nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white – separate and unequal” – still rings true.
这些国家不仅都存在经济和政策疲软（财政和经常项目双重赤字、增长减缓、通胀抬头、停滞不前的结构性改革 ） ， 还都将在今年举行总统或议会选举。	All have in common not only economic and policy weaknesses (twin fiscal and current-account deficits, slowing growth and rising inflation, sluggish structural reforms), but also presidential or parliamentary elections this year.
在私人生活中，美国人已经深陷于消费主义无法自拔，而消费主义则反过来吞噬了美国人的时间、金钱、精力，以及致力于集体福祉的倾向。	In their private lives, Americans have become addicted to consumerism, which drains their time, savings, attention, and inclination to engage in acts of collective compassion.
这些关键改革方面的进展一直令人失望，有的国家用力多（如西班牙和爱尔兰 ） ， 有的国家用力少（意大利和法国是其中之二 ） 。	Progress on such vital reforms has been disappointing, with more effort made in some countries (Spain and Ireland, for example) and less in others (Italy and France, to cite just two).
就像去年美国那场程度有限的导弹攻击一样，最近的打击行动一样没法阻止对方在未来使用化学武器，更无力威胁阿萨德政权的生存。	Like the limited US missile strikes last year, the recent attack will not deter the future use of chemical weapons, much less threaten the survival of Assad’s regime.
伦敦—在很多批评家眼里，欧洲货币联盟看上去极像1913年之前的金本位 — — 在大相径庭的经济体间维系固定汇率。	LONDON – The European Monetary Union, as many of its critics maintain, looks a lot like the pre-1913 gold standard, which imposed fixed exchange rates on extremely diverse economies.
没有了来自中国的廉价太阳能电池板，推动欧洲行业发展的补贴又因为财政原因锐减，太阳能在欧洲所占的份额恐怕远远达不到环保主义者的预期。	With the loss of cheap solar panels from China, and with subsidies that helped to drive the European industry now reduced for fiscal reasons, the share of solar power in Europe will fall far short of environmentalists’ goals.
医疗保健体系常常无法以患者可以承受的价格向他们提供所需治疗，而医疗创新也并不能解决公共健康需求，因此现状是不可持续的。	With health-care systems often failing to provide patients with the treatment they need at a price they can afford, and with health innovation not addressing public health needs, the status quo is not sustainable.
Mesurer la qualité des résultats a beau être un exercice délicat, The Times Higher Education Supplement tente de le faire chaque année.	Measuring the quality of output is difficult, although The Times Higher Education Supplement attempts to do so every year.
与此同时，越来越多的移民 — — 通常来自穆斯林占多数的国家 — — 开始在欧洲各大城市定居，导致了主流政党无力充分反应的社会冲突。	At the same time, more and more immigrants, often from Muslim-majority countries, settled in European cities, resulting in social tensions, to which mainstream parties were unable to respond adequately.
我们需要建立不会因为爆发被控制住就马上被撤销的研究项目，这能够极大地丰富我们更好地管理下一次传染病暴发的办法。	By creating research grants that do not expire as soon as an outbreak is under control, we would substantially increase our portfolio of solutions to manage the next epidemic better.
阿克拉—在最近举行的卢旺达基加利峰会上，44个非洲国家首脑签署了一份新自由贸易协定。 该协定旨在改变地区营商方式。	ACCRA – At a recent summit in Kigali, Rwanda, 44 African heads of state signed a new free-trade agreement aimed at changing the way the region does business.
伊斯兰教将树立伊斯兰教敌对势力作为解决地区弊端的方法，从而导致非穆斯林的边缘化，其中包括许多几百年来在地区经济、文化和政治生活中扮演重要角色的群体。	By promoting Islamic revival as a solution to the region’s ills, Islamism led to the marginalization of non-Muslims, including groups that had played outsize roles in the region’s economic, cultural, and political life for centuries.
在最初的近似（first approximation）中，低碳路径是主要战略，并产生了完全不同也远远更加有利的起作用的激励结构观。	On a first approximation, low-carbon paths are the dominant strategies, implying a completely different and far more favorable view of the incentive structures at work.
关于美国海军陆战队往冲绳县普天间空军基地部署12架V-22鱼鹰式倾转旋翼飞机的争议加剧了该联盟的衰败。	Controversy over the deployment by the US Marines of 12 tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey aircraft to the Futenma Air Base on Okinawa has contributed to the alliance’s decay.
但是，即便是新加坡模式的法治也要比资本主义更加困难，而它的缺失是亚洲要按照欧盟模式建立一个共同体最主要的障碍所在。	But the rule of law, even Singapore-style, is far harder to implement than capitalism, and its absence represents the major obstacle to the establishment of an Asian community based on the EU model.
作为一个人均收入2500美元和35 ％的劳动力仍从事农业的发展中国家，其工人每年收入只有约600美元，中国国内的问题仍然是巨大的。	As a developing country with US$ 2,500 per capita income and 35% of its labor force still in agriculture, where workers earn only about $600 per year, China’s domestic problems remain enormous.
自拉宾和阿拉法特握手以来，大约7500巴勒斯坦人和1400以色列人被杀，受伤和被监禁的更是不计其数。	Since Rabin and Arafat shook hands, roughly 7,500 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis have been killed, and many more have been injured or jailed.
正如哲学家按照真理的本质和对本质的理解分为不同的学派一样，经济学也按照真实世界中的运行模式进行了区分。	Just as philosophers are divided on the nature of truth and understanding, economics is divided on the workings of the real world.
由于发达国家不愿向发展中国家的廉价产品开放市场，而发展中国家也力求保护自己现有的新生工业，多哈回合贸易谈判陷入了僵局。	The Doha Round of trade negotiations is stalled because developed countries do not want to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries, which in turn try to protect what nascent industries they have.
2014年12月24日，就在欧洲法院裁决6天后，科学家发表了他们从人类表皮细胞制造基本卵子和精子细胞的研究成果。	On December 24, 2014, just six days after the ECJ’s ruling, scientists published the results of their efforts to make rudimentary egg and sperm cells starting from a person’s skin cells.
但是，凭他的资质 — — 他精通汉语，又是建设性政策思想家，与美国和中国的重要人物有着长期紧密的个人关系 — — 他的观点必须认真对待。	But, given his credentials – he is a formidable Chinese linguist and creative policy thinker, with long and close personal relationships with key figures in both the US and China – his argument must be taken seriously.
我们需要撒切尔夫人那样的勇气，需要比尔·克林顿那种能引导选民把自身利益与政治家目标融为一体的超凡政治游说力。	We need the sort of courage that was the hallmark of Margaret Thatcher. We need Bill Clinton’s extraordinary ability to spin a political narrative that enabled voters to identify their own interests with his goals.
如果伊朗有诚意，结果就有可能是人们期待已久的“总体协议 ” ， 也就是以伊朗为一方，美国、欧洲以及美国的地区盟友为另一方的地区性和解。	If Iran is serious, the result may be nothing less than the long awaited “Grand Bargain” – a regional reconciliation of interests between Iran, on one side, and America, Europe, and the region’s US allies on the other.
随着伊朗盟国或代理在叙利亚、伊拉克、黎巴嫩和也门的日渐活跃，沙特领导人越来越感到被周边的伊朗势力所包围。	With Iranian allies or proxies operating in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, Saudi Arabia’s leaders have felt increasingly surrounded.
纳兰达在那个时候接收了成千上万的中国学生，并且有些印度人也来到中国；有一位印度僧人在五世纪的时候在杭州建立了著名的灵隐寺。	Nalanda received hundreds of Chinese students in its time, and a few Indians went the other way; a Buddhist monk from India built the famous Lingyin Si temple in Huangzhou in the fifth century.
虽然欧洲接收了来自叙利亚，利比亚和阿富汗等国的大量移民，但是很多新来者都基本没有受过教育，让这些人实现就业极为困难。	Europe has experienced significant immigration from countries such as Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan; but many of the newcomers have little education, and finding them employment has proved difficult.
其他经济学家（主要是欧洲经济学家）认为希腊必须扮演与其经济重要性相当的政治角色，必须接受主权分享（和债务共担）安排以确保货币联盟的凝聚力和可持续性。	Other economists, mainly in Europe, argue that Germany must assume a political role befitting its economic preeminence and must accept sovereignty-sharing (and burden-sharing) arrangements to ensure the monetary union’s cohesion and sustainability.
因此，消除贸易赤字需要将2.5%的美国实际产量转移到世界其他国家，以及让GDP真实值再下降2.7%的进出口价格变化。	Thus, eliminating the trade deficit would require shifting about 2.5% of US physical production to the rest of the world, as well as a change in export and import prices that reduces their real value by another 2.7% of GDP.
当市场意识到这一过程即将来临时，将把意大利主权利率推到更低水平。 由于意大利沉重的国民债务负担，利息支付将增加超过GDP的5%的财政赤字。	When the markets see that coming, they will drive Italy’s sovereign interest rates even lower. Given Italy’s very large national debt, interest payments add more than 5% of GDP to the fiscal deficit.
讽刺的是，美国 — — 欧洲最大的盟友、欧盟最大的贸易伙伴 — — 最后也可能从中获益，但如果推定共和党提名人唐纳德·特朗普赢得11月总统大选的话，美国就可能无法获得好处。	Ironically, the United States – Europe’s greatest ally and the EU’s largest trading partner – may also end up as a beneficiary, though not if Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, wins the presidential election in November.
更有甚者，绝大多数的服务市场¾证券交易、批零流通、企业服务和本地设施¾依旧置于政府的保护之下，不受竞争和自由流通规则的约束。	Moreover, most markets for services - securities trading, wholesale and retail distribution, business services, and local utilities - remain sheltered from competition and free circulation rules.
在六月底举行的会议上，欧洲领导人首次承认了此次危机具有多面性，他们承认实行内部整顿的紧缩政策并不能解决��题。	At their meeting at the end of June, European leaders acknowledged for the first time the multiple dimensions of the crisis, accepting that austerity – putting everyone’s house in order – will not suffice.
类似地，俄罗斯及其金砖国家伙伴（巴西、印度、中国和南非）正在成立一个开发银行，作为西方控制的国际货币基金组织和世界银行的替代品。	Likewise, Russia and its BRICS partners (Brazil, India, China, and South Africa) are creating a development bank that is to serve as an alternative to the Western-controlled International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
中国和日本这些大国的经济联系变得越来越紧密 — — 不仅仅是贸易额的持续增长，还有直接投资和地区产品网络的加强。	Economic relations between major players such as China and Japan are increasingly close – owing not only to booming trade, but also to direct investment and regional production networks.
让全世界二十亿无法获得银行服务的人走出阴影，进入主流金融体系需要监管者、私人部门、非营利组织、地区机构和国际组织之间的新合作。	Bringing the world’s two billion unbanked people out of the shadows and into the mainstream financial system will require new partnerships among regulators, the private sector, non-profits, regional bodies, and international organizations.
但他们没能给人民带来更好的生活，加上左翼思想因为苏联解体而失去信誉，于是产生了敌对运动 — — 政治伊斯兰教。	But their failure to deliver better lives to their citizens, together with the discrediting of left-wing ideologies following the Soviet Union’s collapse, fueled the rise of a rival movement: political Islam.
事实上，政治分析家谢尔盖·卡拉加诺夫（Sergei Karaganov）在2009年时指出，俄罗斯缺少软实力正是其激进行事的原因 — — 比如前年与格鲁吉亚的战争。	Indeed, as the political analyst Sergei Karaganov noted in 2009, Russia’s lack of soft power is precisely what is driving it to behave aggressively – such as in its war with Georgia the previous year.
但如果这种观点正确，那么我们现在应该看到大量长期资本流出以及中国外汇市场上出现大量抛售人民币换取美元的现象。	But if that were true, we would now be seeing significant long-term capital outflows and heavy selling of RMB for dollars in China’s foreign-exchange market.
以美国为首的北约在1999年对塞尔维亚的轰炸便未受到国际法的认可，并且是在塞尔维亚盟国俄罗斯的强烈反对下发生的。	The US-led NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 lacked the sanction of international law, and occurred despite the strong objections of Russia, a Serbian ally.
中国政府成功地以这种方式阻止股价崩盘似乎证明了马克思主义的观点，即经济和金融危机不会出现在控制经济当中。	In this manner, China’s government managed to stop a rout, seemingly reinforcing the Marxist view that economic and financial crises do not occur in controlled economies.
相反，2007年，109位民主党众议员投票赞成美国-秘鲁贸易促进协定（US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement ） ， 原因正是其条款根据5月协定的要求做出了相应调整。	In 2007, by contrast, 109 House Democrats voted in favor of the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, precisely because its terms had been adjusted as requested and in line with the May agreement.
奥巴马可能会意识到，当自己是世界唯一超级大国的领袖时，如果想得到人们的尊敬，就得至少要让别人有点害怕你。	Obama may have come to understand that when you are the leader of the world’s only superpower, you need to be feared just a little if you are to be respected.
在出现了最近的误算的情况下，我们必须校准我们的政治雷达 — — 而这意味着考虑一切潜在干扰源，而不只是符合条理的干扰源。	In the wake of recent miscalculations, we must recalibrate our political radars – and that means accounting for all potential sources of interference, not just those that fit a neat narrative.
一开始，通过全球央行资产负债表的扩张（2009年规模达5万亿美元）给了银行避免倒闭所需要的廉价资金。	Initially, balance-sheet expansion – by $5 trillion since 2009 – provided banks with the cheap funding they needed to avoid failure.
中国在2017年那让人惊叹的1.5万亿美元的扩张规模意味着，从名义GDP层面它实质上创造了一个与韩国同等大小，相当于瑞士的2倍，瑞典的3倍的新经济体。	China’s staggering $1.5 trillion expansion in 2017 means that, in nominal terms, it essentially created a new economy the size of South Korea, twice the size of Switzerland, and three times the size of Sweden.
新加坡 — — 上个月，在多年的犹豫不决之后，巴基斯坦军方在北瓦济里斯坦部落机构展开了清剿恐怖分子基地和结束该地区无法无天状况的全面军事行动。	SINGAPORE – Last month, after years of indecision, Pakistan’s military launched a full-scale military operation in the North Waziristan Tribal Agency aimed at eliminating terrorist bases and ending the region’s lawlessness.
例如，我深信，多年来在金融服务市场的供给方面，金融机构通过其组织良好且强有力的游说工作，对政府部门有许多“监管俘虏 ” （ regulatory capture ） 。	I am convinced, for example, that over the years there has been too much “regulatory capture” by the supply side of the financial services market, with its well-organized and powerful lobbies.
对叙利亚而言，这意味着现有政府的组成部分，包括阿萨德的阿拉维派在内，均应与反对派和库尔德人一道加入到全面联盟。	For Syria, this means that part of the existing state, including Assad’s Alawite sect, should be included in a broad coalition, along with the opposition and the Kurds.
德国海军的大型补给舰 — — 可以在拯救地中海难民的行动中派上大用场 — — 因为缺少备用部件，而18个月 无法执行任务。	The German Navy’s large supply ships – those most useful for refugee rescue operations in the Mediterranean – will be out of commission for 18 months, owing to a lack of spare parts.
积累了大量未偿还债务的银行随之缩小贷款规模，而尽管各国政府及中央银行大肆出手干预，此次危机还是把全球经济拖下了水。	Banks with substantial overhanging debt reduced lending, and, despite the massive intervention of governments and central banks, the crisis dragged down the global economy.
国际货币基金组织还应该更为主动，在体制上重要的国家更为直言不讳。 在这些国家中，金融监管和危机管理的缺点已经显现出来。	The IMF should also be more proactive and speak with greater candor in systemically important countries, where shortcomings in financial supervision and crisis management have appeared.
在政治谈判这个清晰明了的交换条件背后，来自法塔赫和哈马斯的谈判代表还负有让哈马斯广受欢迎的政治信仰与法塔赫传统的世俗抱负互相融合的职责。	Underneath this clear-cut quid pro quo of political bargaining, the representatives from Fatah and Hamas are charged with finding the means to reconcile Hamas’s tremendously popular political ideology with Fatah’s traditional secular aspirations.
该数据将中国2011年度的投资收入逆差从268亿美元调整为853亿美元 — — 这一重大修改不但令人开始怀疑中国国际收支统计的可信度，还暴露出了经济发展路径中存在的一个问题。	The data adjusted China’s investment-income deficit for 2011 from $26.8 billion to $85.3 billion – a massive revision that casts doubt on the reliability of China’s balance-of-payments statistics and exposes a flaw in the economy’s growth path.
欧盟宪法条约在法国和荷兰公投中所遭遇的挫败看来已经引发新的舆论导向，即应该放缓欧盟进一步扩张的脚步，甚至应该停止。	The defeat of the EU’s Constitutional Treaty in referendums in France and the Netherlands has, it seems, given rise to a new consensus that further enlargement of the Union should be slowed down, or even stopped.
例如，如果伊朗的核试验活动周围有足够的伊朗自愿接受的检查和控制，那我们可以有信心在早期阶段探测到任何这样的活动转向军事目的。	For example, if Iran’s nuclear activities were to be surrounded with enough voluntarily accepted checks and controls, we could be confident of detecting at an early stage any diversion toward military purposes.
她控诉说当时自己“太出名 ” 、 “太活跃”和“太受压 ” ， 并且她对毛的妻子江青如何迫害叶剑英一家以及叶剑英的孩子如何入狱提供了大量具体的细节。	She complained that she was “too famous,” “too active,” and “too stressed” at the time, and she provided extensive details about how Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, persecuted the Ye family and how the Ye children went to prison.
但特朗普虽然欣欣然为美国的仇恨思想煽风点火，他倒并非是始作俑者，正如退欧派也不是英国乱象的始作俑者。	But while Trump has gleefully fanned the flames of hatred in the US, he did not kindle them, just as the Brexiteers did not do so in the UK.
问题在于卢卡斯的说法只适合一些经济增长模型，这些模型有严格的假设，即“包含的”资本回报会随着资本的积累趋近于零。	The problem is that Lucas’s statement is true only for models of economic growth that are specified in such a way that the return on “embodied” capital drops to zero as capital accumulates.
这些西方人同时也认为俄罗斯政治的传统就是每一个新“沙皇”都力图在一定程度上否定其前任的遗产，因此也会在每一个时代之初迎来一段政治解冻期。	They also view Russia in terms of a tradition whereby every new tsar partly repudiates the legacy of his predecessor, creating a political thaw at the beginning of a new reign.
这部还未上映就获得好评的影片表现了���群反对拿破仑统治的西班牙游击队员被带到一堵墙边等待执行死刑。	The pre-credit sequence shows a group of Spanish guerrillas during the insurgency against Napoleon being led to a wall where they are to be executed by firing squad.
但铁幕降落、这一划时代的事件过去二十年后，仍有类似的铁幕环绕着古巴，使得今年的纪念更加令人感到刻骨铭心。	That 20 years after this epochal event an iron curtain remains around Cuba makes this anniversary poignant.
与她的丈夫不同 — — 比尔·克林顿在总统任上支持并签署了多项自由贸易协定 — — 克林顿正在逐渐转向民主党中的保护主义阵营。	Unlike her husband, who supported and signed free-trade agreements during his presidency, Clinton is inching closer to the protectionist wing of the Democratic Party.
毕竟 ， “ 波将金村”是在叶卡捷琳娜大帝统治时期发明的。 在女皇巡游全国之时，这些村落以色彩明快的外立面掩盖了叶卡捷琳娜的农奴们污秽的生活。	After all, it was during the reign of Catherine the Great that the “Potemkin village” was invented, whereby the squalor of the lives of Catherine’s serfs was hidden behind cheerfully painted housing façades as the Empress toured her country.
不久前，一位日本某电视节目的代表要求采访我。 这个节目与一家偏自由派立场的报纸有关，采访的内容是首相安倍晋三的经济改革战略，即“安倍经济学 ” 。	Not long ago, representatives from a Japanese television program associated with a liberal-leaning newspaper requested an interview with me to discuss Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic-reform strategy, known as “Abenomics.”
事实上，众所周知，平均产妇死亡率很难估计，因为冲突、贫困、基础设施薄弱、医疗系统薄弱和资源不足导致未能上报许多死亡案例。	In fact, MMRs are notoriously difficult to estimate, with conflict, poverty, poor infrastructure, weak health systems, and inadequate resources causing many deaths to go unreported.
有发展政策经验的人都知道，财政转移支付无法产生趋同增长，除非有深度社会变革配合 — — 而这要求积极的地方领导。	As anyone with experience in development policy knows, fiscal transfers cannot generate convergence growth, unless they are backed by deep societal changes – and that demands active local leadership.
那些例外情况可以被定义为IMF与成员国之间所谓第四条（Article IV）磋商的一部分 — — 某种强化IMF对该国监控程度的手段。	Exceptions could be identified as part of the IMF’s so-called Article IV consultations with members – an approach that would strengthen IMF country surveillance.
政府需要营造一种透明文化，以确保融资用于生产用途 — — 而不是被非法挪用，或带着政治目的用于低增加值项目。	Governments will need to foster a culture of transparency to ensure that financing is put to productive use – rather than illicitly syphoned off or directed to low-value-added projects for political purposes.
比如，跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership，TPP）表明了奥巴马与占全球贸易三分之一、全球GDP百分之四十的地区形成一致的决心。	For example, the negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) reflect President Obama’s determination to strike an accord with countries that represent one-third of global trade and 40% of global GDP.
"当世界各国的领导人们在四年前的""千年峰会""上会晤时，他们就一系列旨在到2015年将全球贫困减少一半的远期目标达成共识。"	When the world's leaders met at the Millennium Summit four years ago, they agreed on a set of goals aimed at cutting global poverty in half by 2015.
它仿佛喊出了在生命某一阶段中男性内心深处的渴望 — — 当然也表达了那些喜欢这类电影和电视节目的女性的内心渴望，那是一个人可以投奔自由，冒险和重塑自我的人生阶段，同时也是不受社会关系和家庭责任束缚的阶段。	It seems to speak to a deep longing in men – and in the women who also enjoy these films and TV shows – for a time in one’s life when one could dash toward freedom, adventure, and self-reinvention, unencumbered by social ties and family obligations.
在美国，设限+交易原本应当被视为一个共和党方案：其背后的支持者都是那些自认为倾向市场而非偏好管制的人。	Cap and trade was originally supposed to be a Republican idea in the US: its backers were those who considered themselves pro-market, not those who considered themselves pro-regulation.
武契奇和萨奇能留下什么样的政治遗产将在很大程度上取决于他们制定与欧盟基本价值观相符的现实提案的意愿。	Vučić and Thaçi’s legacies will largely depend on their willingness to formulate a realistic proposal that aligns with the foundational values of the EU.
奥朗德的参照点似乎是他年轻时那种二战后的田园牧歌，一个飞速增长的时代，人口年龄分布恢复到合理水平，没什么移民，也缺乏全球竞争。	Hollande’s reference point seems to be the post-war idyll of his youth, a time of rapid growth, demographic recovery, scarce immigration, and scant global competition.
但2009年来 — — 那也是经济衰退最糟糕的年份 — — 全球经济平均增长率为3.3 % ， 与20世纪80年代和90年代大致相同。	But since 2009 – the worst year of the recession – the global economy has grown at an average rate of 3.3%, just as it did in the 1980s and 1990s.
因此结论就是尚未达到相对“安全”的门槛的国家对于解除资本控制应该保持谨慎，但是对于达到门槛的国家则应该尽量掘取可观的净利益。	One conclusion, therefore, is for countries to be cautious about removing capital controls when they have not yet reached the relevant “safety” thresholds, but equally to stress the sizable net benefits for countries that exceed the thresholds.
而IMF也确实给其希腊贷款加上了条件 — — 包括财政紧缩、私有化和退休金和税收制度的结构改革 — — 其中大部分条件都是解决希腊资不抵债问题不可或缺的措施。	And the IMF did impose conditions on its loans to Greece – including fiscal austerity, privatization, and structural reform of its pension and tax systems – most of which were necessary to address the country’s insolvency.
荷兰和美国央行都直接参与监督银行系统，它们在识别潜在系统性问题方面并不比其他国家的非央行监管者更有效。	The Dutch and American central banks, with direct oversight of their banking systems, were no more effective in identifying potentially dangerous systemic issues than were non-central bank regulators elsewhere.
他的第一个行动方针应该是与联合国机构，国际组织负责人以及世界领导人召开会议，制定一个协调一致共同努力的议程以保护世界各地的年轻人。	His first course of action should be to call a meeting with the heads of UN agencies and international organizations, as well as world leaders, to create an agenda for concerted and coordinated efforts to protect young people everywhere.
最近几年，虽然国际货币基金组织和世界银行逐渐成为世界上最贫穷国家的唯一贷款人，但是，它们的贷款数量却都在急剧减少。	In recent years, lending by both institutions contracted dramatically, even though they have increasingly become the exclusive lenders to the world’s poorest countries.
这些北约国家的执政者现在想要的 — — 或者至少他们知道他们需要的 — — 是美国的指示、引导和支持。	What those who govern the NATO countries now want – or at least what they know they need – is US guidance, direction, and support.
事实上，美联储官员没有证明在做出正确预测方面的无能已经促使他们更新了模型，这正在让很多人失去对美联储做出可靠决策的能力的信心。	Indeed, the failure of officials to convey how their inability to make accurate predictions has prompted them to update their model is leading many to lose confidence in the Fed’s capacity for sound decision-making.
自然选择为诸如哺乳动物的眼睛，鸟类的翅膀，以及植物将光转变成为糖类的能力这样多样化的特性提供了科学的解释。	Natural selection has provided scientific explanations of traits as diverse as the mammalian eye, the bird’s wing, and the ability of plants to transform light into sugars.
自从艾哈迈德内贾德去年访问巴西以后，伊朗与就核问题展开谈判的国家间的关系就发生了恶化。 在艾哈迈德内贾德颇受争议地再次当选之后，这种恶化就发生了。	Relations between Iran and the countries that are negotiating the nuclear question have deteriorated since Ahmadinejad’s visit to Brazil last year, which came soon after his disputed re-election.
但这里有一个根本性区别：反对控枪的民主党这样做是有悖于本党官方立场的；而共和党这样做是契合本党立场的。	But there is a fundamental difference: Democrats who oppose gun controls do so in defiance of their party’s official program, whereas Republicans do so in conformity with theirs.
审计办公室的任务很简单：在布朗和维特的要求下，它不得不对政府给予大型银行控股公司的隐性担保的规模和影响做一个评估。	The GAO had a simple task: At the request of Brown and Vitter, it was charged with assessing the scale and impact of the implicit guarantees provided by the government to large bank holding companies.
发自墨西哥城 — — 在即将到来的7月1日，墨西哥人很可能会将曾经统治该国70年的革命制度党（Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI）再次选上权力宝座。	MEXICO CITY – On July 1, Mexico will in all likelihood vote the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled the country for seven decades, back into power.
我们已经在苹果的iPhone上看到了新范式的线索，iPhone可以进行手指动作识别，但是在智能技术界，概念可视化非常激进，以至于绝大多数的普通用户可能都不能意识到它是什么东西。	We’ve seen hints of a new paradigm in Apple’s iPhone, which allows gestural finger motions, but in the intelligence community, concept visualization can be so radical that most ordinary users might barely recognize what it was.
这看上去也是只是边际进步，但实际上相对于通常十分缓慢的结构变化速度已是相当迅速 — — 中国的结构变化直到2011年才根据十二五规划开始实施。	That may seem like marginal progress, but it is actually quite rapid relative to the normally glacial pace of structural change – a process that began in China only in 2011 with the enactment of the 12th Five-Year Plan.
其一与两个主要核大国 — — 俄罗斯和美国 — — 是否准备好了从旅行它们所签署的新战略核武器削减条约（New START）削减库存承诺迈向完全消除它们的核武库。	One is related to the readiness of the two major nuclear powers, Russia and the United States, to move from the stockpile reductions to which they agreed in the New START treaty to complete elimination of their nuclear arsenals.
如果说这些国家犯了一个错误的话，只是如同今天的德国一样 — — 太轻信市场了。 因此他们才像美国及其他国家一样允许资产泡沫恣意生长。	If these countries made a mistake, it was only that, like Germany today, they were overly credulous of markets, so they (like the United States and so many others) allowed an asset bubble to grow unchecked.
如果通货膨胀增加确实比美联储预期的更快，美联储或许将被迫更快地提高利率，给金融市场乃至整体经济造成不利影响。	If inflation does rise faster than the Fed expects, it may be forced to increase interest rates rapidly, with adverse effects on financial markets and potentially on the broader economy.
结果是，穆尔西的激励变成了巩固权力，而不是起草包容性宪法；在全民公投中，穆斯林兄弟会支持的宪法草案获得了64%的选民支持，但投票比例只有33 % 。	As a result, Morsi’s incentives were to consolidate power rather than produce an inclusive constitution; put to a referendum, the draft backed by the Brotherhood was approved by 64% of voters, but with a turnout of just 33%.
但如果我们未使用的数据能够被公开调阅，我们就可能吸引新的合作者重新启动这项研究 — — 还有可能启动效果更好的分析。	If our unused data were openly available, however, we could attract new collaborators to return to it – and potentially generate stronger analyses.
欧洲拉比大会主席戈德施密特（Pinchas Goldschmidt）最近评论说，你不可能以犹太人的过去为荣，又告诉今天的犹太人他们的宗教行为不再受欢迎了。	As Pinchas Goldschmidt, President of the Conference of European Rabbis, recently remarked, one cannot be proud of the Jews of yesterday and tell the Jews of today that their religious practices are no longer welcome.
但如果他有信心汇率将保持稳定，他就不需要约束工资 — — 而中国目前的年工资增长已经达到了10—15 % 。	But if he can be confident that the exchange rate will remain stable, he will not need to restrain wages – and China has experienced 10-15% annual wage growth already.
事实上，我们的研究表明，若互相承诺协议包括严格的来源国限制，则地区内贸易将增加，与其他国家的贸易会削弱，发展中国家损失最大。	Indeed, our research shows that when mutual-recognition agreements include restrictive rules of origin, intra-regional trade increases – at the expense of trade with other countries – and that developing countries tend to suffer most.
而这也是撰写博客回应蔡美儿文章的Betty Ming Liu的观点 ： “ 蔡美儿式的家长就是我这样的华裔美国人接受心理治疗的原因 ” 。	That’s also the view of Betty Ming Liu, who blogged in response to Chua’s article: “Parents like Amy Chua are the reason why Asian-Americans like me are in therapy.”
正如拉尔夫·奥萨向美国国家经济研究局提交的工作报告所显示的那样，如果德国没有利用��际市场，其生活水平可能只有现在的一半左右。	As Ralph Ossa showed in a working paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research, if Germany did not have access to international markets, its standard of living would be half of what it is now.
毕竟，成就美国的国家 — — 特别是中国等出口拉动经济体及其依赖资源的供应链 — — 从美国的消费狂热中获益，因为这大大刺激了全球贸易的扩张。	After all, the enablers – especially export-led economies like China, along with its resource-dependent supply chain – benefited from America’s consumption binge, as it drove an outsize expansion of global trade.
最后，美非领导人峰会的规格相当高，有40多个国家的元首出席，奥巴马总统也直接参与了峰会，这使得非洲话题成了热门。	Finally, the high profile of the US-Africa Leaders Summit, with more than 40 heads of state in attendance, as well as President Barack Obama’s direct involvement, generated buzz about Africa.
在2014年，中国非汽车行业每一万名员工中仅有11台机器人，而在汽车组装线上213台机器人则对应着每万名员工。	In 2014, China had just 11 robots per 10,000 employees in non-automotive industries, and just 213 per 10,000 employees on automotive assembly lines.
这项运动开始于突尼斯，该国爆发的革命将总统宰因·阿比丁·本·阿里的专制政权赶下台来，随后蔓延到埃及和利比亚，结束了穆巴拉克和卡扎菲更残暴、更腐败的政权统治。	It started in Tunisia, where the revolution swept President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s repressive regime out of power. It then spread to Egypt and Libya, ending Hosni Mubarak’s and Muammar el-Qaddafi’s even more repressive and corrupt regimes.
但上述推理有一个危险的弱点：即假定合法卡特尔 — — 即需求管理的拟议模式之一 — — 会因为低成本向市场提供象牙而挤出非法的象牙供应。	But this line of reasoning has a dangerous weakness: It assumes that a legal cartel – one proposed model for regulating supply – would crowd out illegal suppliers by providing ivory to the market at a lower cost.
所采取的对策必须与一个世纪前完成普及中等教育、以及开始于20世纪60年代的大学教育普及运动具有同等的规模。	The response must be on par with the establishment of universal secondary education a century ago, or with the “college for all” movement that began in the 1960s.
这些运动，如相当公开化的“足够 ” （ Barakat）运动，鼓励阿尔及利亚人从愤怒而消极的弃权转为积极的抵制。	Such movements, like the much-publicized “Barakat” (“Enough”), have encouraged a shift among Algerians from resentful abstention to active boycott.
近日，巴西成功抵抗艾滋病、莫桑比克成功抗击疟疾以及中国抵御肺结核的例子，显示了全球范围内更多资源所能带来的成功，并产生了一种新方式将援助发放至最需要它的地方。	Recent successes in Brazil against AIDS, in Mozambique against malaria, and in China against TB, show what can be achieved on a global scale with more resources. There are new ways of directing aid to where it is most needed.
十九世纪初，担心被取代驱使约克夏和兰开夏的纺织工人 — — 即“卢德分子 ” — —砸毁自动纺纱机和织布框架等机器。	In the early nineteenth century, fear of such dislocation drove textile workers in Yorkshire and Lancashire – the “Luddites” – to smash new machines like automated looms and knitting frames.
凭良心说，我无法“无脑站边”任何法国、意大利或希腊所提出的再分配方案，如果这些方案有违公正原则的话。	I could not, in good conscience, side credibly with any French, Italian, or Greek proponent of redistribution if their proposals violated the principles of rectitude.
这些称雄一时的团体不愿意变革或者合作，也无法制订出吸引选民的方法干脆就消亡了，从而让正义和发展党控制了保守派选民根基。	Unwilling to change or work together, and unable to devise ways of appealing to voters, these once-powerful groups simply disappeared, leaving the AKP largely in control of the conservative electoral base.
土耳其、伊朗、沙特阿拉伯、以色列、俄罗斯和美国往往各有各的算盘，这一事实更加意味着可能出现没有法律基础的混乱未来。	The fact that Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Russia, and the United States are working at cross-purposes more often than not further suggests a messy future without legal foundation.
像基尔特·怀尔德斯（Geert Wilders）这样的北欧煽动者则将伊斯兰教视为西方文明的主要威胁，同时又为同性恋权利等群体辩护（因为据说穆斯林非常讨厌它们 ） 。	Northern European demagogues, like Geert Wilders, see Islam as the main threat to Western civilization, but defend such causes as gay rights (because Muslims supposedly hate them).
例如，在什么情况下，为了保护隐私权而减少新闻自由是正确的呢？ 或者在什么情况下，为了保护新闻自由而减少对隐私的保护是正确的呢？	Under what circumstances, for example, is it right to curtail press freedom in order to protect the right to privacy, or vice versa?
欧盟一体化的深化进程给欧洲大陆带来了动力；尽管欧洲当前遇到了一些困难，但它仍具有引以为豪的实力和国际影响力。	The progressive deepening of EU integration has brought dynamic vigor to the European continent; despite Europe’s current difficulties, it still boasts extraordinary overall strength and international influence.
如果支付公平合理的一次性补偿，那么绝大多数公务员就都可以接受，公众舆论也会对拒绝接受的贪婪或懒惰之辈表示不满。	If a fair one-time payment is offered, it is likely to be taken up by a majority of civil servants, and public opinion will frown upon the greedy or lazy ones who turn it down.
应该考虑全球税收 — — 公司所得、离岸账户、国际金融交易、亿万富翁净财富、污染等 — — 来为承受压力的联动世界买单。	The time has come to think about new global taxes – on corporate incomes, offshore accounts, international financial transactions, billionaires’ net wealth, and pollution – to pay for an interconnected world under stress.
以色列和巴勒斯坦之间的冲突，是这一重要地缘政治区域的停滞不前的一个突出例子，因为这种冲突似乎完全不受任何国际形势动荡的影响。	The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians stands out as an example of the static nature of this key geopolitical region, because it seems to be completely unaffected by any international upheaval.
公共部门也可以促进这些项目采用开放的平台和标准，从而推动其在全球城市的应用（巴塞罗那的“城市协议”计划在这方面迈出了重要的一步 ） 。	The public sector can also promote the use of open platforms and standards in such projects, which would speed up adoption in cities worldwide (Barcelona’s “city protocol” initiative is a step in this direction).
也许当局将能够在 2016 年控制住局面；但更有可能的是人民币将继续其震荡之路 — — 也让全球市场随之上下翻飞。	Maybe the authorities will be able to hold on in 2016; but it is more likely that the renminbi will continue its rocky ride – taking global markets along with it.
某些人认为现在讨论替换性的货币框架为时尚早。 与此相反，中国有很好的理由现在就为向独立的货币政策过渡建立机制性基础。	Contrary to those who regard the discussion of an alternative monetary framework as premature, there are good reasons for China to begin right now to build the institutional foundation for the transition to an independent monetary policy.
在我看来，欧元必须下跌这一观点有一个非常充分的理由，而欧元应该维持稳定甚至升值有六个不那么令人信服的理由。	I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall, and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate.
不幸的是，叙利亚的温和逊尼派腹背受敌：巴沙尔政府和极端的瓦哈比派（伊斯兰教中最偏狭的思想流派 ） 。	Unfortunately, Syria’s moderate Sunnis came under attack from two sides: Assad’s government and extremist adherents of Wahhabism, Islam’s most intolerant school of thought.
诚然，巴西仍旧是一个“硬”左派国家。 譬如，卢拉党内的一些人还支持古巴的卡斯特罗兄弟和委内瑞拉总统乌戈 查韦斯。	True, Brazil still has a “hard” left, and some in Lula’s own party are comfortable with, say, Cuba’s Castro brothers and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.
而如果欧洲各国的财政部长面对汇率上的僵局感到沮丧，而一致产生独创性地管理他们的预算以刺激短期需求而不是长期增长，那将是更加糟糕的结果。	It would be even worse if European ministers, frustrated with gridlock over exchange rates, started sharing ideas for creatively managing their budgets to stimulate short-term demand, rather than long-term growth.
但是印度知道，这样做的附带损害会很大，平民生命代价令人难以接受，而且冲突失去控制的风险过大，因此无法考虑这一选择。	India understands, though, that the collateral damage would be too high, the price in civilian lives unacceptable, and the risks of the conflict spiraling out of control too acute to contemplate such an option.
此外，可持续农业重写了小型家庭农庄的价值，而在布基纳法索等国家，有近一半的国内粮食供给来自小型家庭农庄。	Moreover, sustainable practices reassert the value of small, family-run holdings, which, in countries like Burkina Faso, produce nearly all of the domestic food supply.
包括金融服务在内的自由贸易协议将最大限度地减少脱欧对各方的伤害，因为欧洲企业仍然得依赖伦敦作为该地区唯一的全球金融中心。	A free-trade agreement that includes financial services will minimize the damage from Brexit for all parties involved, because European firms will still rely on London as the region’s only global financial center.
在奥巴马成为美国总统前，他指出，美国在阿富汗没有足够的地面部队，因此而“空袭村庄和杀害平民，这给当地造成了极大的问题 。 ”	Before Barack Obama became President, he argued that, because the US did not have enough troops on the ground in Afghanistan, it was “air-raiding villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous problems there.”
为此我们应该牢记马克·吐温对自家猫的记述：在不小心坐在了热炉子上之后，它永远不会干同样的事，但同时也对一个冷的炉子敬而远之。	But we should recall Mark Twain’s story about his cat. After sitting on a hot stove, it would never sit on a hot stove again, but neither would it sit on a cold one.
库雷西还指责印度2014年袭击了白沙瓦一所军事院校，那次袭击的责任人已经被确认为巴基斯坦国内向政府发动战争的恐怖组织巴基斯坦塔利班。	Qureshi also blames India for a 2014 attack on an army school in Peshawar that has been credibly attributed to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, a home-grown terrorist group waging war on the Pakistani government.
当然他也必须与伊朗讨价还价，确保伊朗人能信守承诺，并作为一个无核武器国家继续留在《核不扩散条约》之内。	And, of course, he will need to pursue the negotiations with Iran to persuade them to keep their word and remain in the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state.
不过仍然可能通过抛售空置住房来抵消一部分建设成本，也可以把这些轧钢机械便宜卖给其他国家，或作为废品处理掉。	It still may be possible to sell off vacant apartments for a fraction of their construction cost. It may be possible to sell off rolling mill machinery to other countries, or as scrap.
而中国之所以不断对其战略资产进行现代化改造，目的就是通过提升其核力量的生存能力来提升其遏制性威慑的可靠性。	The purpose behind China’s continuous modernization of its strategic assets is to enhance the credibility of its deterrent threat by improving the survivability of its nuclear forces.
类似地，特朗普贸易战的首要目标 — — 中国，已经同意俄罗斯提出的报复美国在日本和韩国部署弹道导弹防御系统的计划。	Likewise, China, the primary target of Trump’s trade war, has now agreed to a Russian plan to retaliate against the announced deployment of US missile-defense systems in Japan and South Korea.
中国2004年全国人民代表大会将个体户、私营企业主重新定义为“社会主义事业建设者 ” ， 并把他们包括进爱国统一战线。	In China, the National People’s Congress in 2004 re-defined entrepreneurs and individual proprietors as “builders of the socialist cause,” and included them in the Patriotic United Front.
由于来自化石燃料温室气体的排放，当今大气中的二氧化碳含量比100万年前多了1/3，而冰川的崩坍则印证了这一点。	Owing to fossil-fuel emissions, there is now one-third more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than at any time in at least a million years, as the latest ice drilling in Antarctica has revealed.
而美国评论员 — — 以及越来越多的法官 — — 都想把企业的首席执行官和董事会与其公司的交易股东进一步隔离开来。	American commentators – and, increasingly, US judges – want to insulate CEOs and boards further from their firms’ trading shareholders.
首先，它正逐渐成为一个关注国家债务，尤其是其期限结构的机构，致力于保证该债务市场继续运营顺利，不出现崩溃和恐慌事件。	In the first place, it is becoming an institution concerned with state debt, particularly with its term structure, and with ensuring that the market for that debt continues to operate smoothly, without episodes of breakdown and panic.
葛兰的追随者 — — 声称支持AKP追求的自由民主和容忍、现代的伊斯兰教 — — 似乎是埃尔多安政府的天然盟友。	Gülen followers – who claimed to support liberal democracy and the tolerant, modern form of Islam embraced by the AKP – seemed like natural allies of Erdoğan’s government.
它不能被称为“原教旨主义 ” ， 因为 印度教是一种罕见的没有原教旨的宗教：它没有单一的圣经，没有单一的神，甚至没有“安息日 ” 。	It cannot be described as “fundamentalism,” for Hinduism is a religion singularly devoid of fundamentals: it lacks a single sacred book, a single version of divinity, and even the equivalent of a Sabbath day.
虽然拥有占全世界5%的人口以及极大份额的石油和天然气资源，但阿拉伯世界却总是落后于世界其他地区，并品尝着所谓“教育贫困”所结下的苦果。	With 5% of the world’s population and the bulk of the world’s oil and gas, the Arab world nonetheless lags behind most of the rest of the world, and suffers from what can best be termed “educational poverty.”
发自牛津 — — 联合国正在甄选下一任秘书长，世界银行行长的职位正虚位以待，而世界卫生组织也在物色一位新带头人，其他一些国际组织也面临着类似的状况。	OXFORD – The United Nations is seeking a new secretary-general. The World Bank presidency is up for grabs.
我们有的人并不是后犹太复国主义者，而是自由派复国主义者。 我们甚至并不对我们的社会进入这一自我审视和自我批评的方式感到骄傲。	Those of us who were not post-Zionists, but liberal Zionists, were even proud of the way our society had entered this phase of self-inspection and self-critique.
参议员林赛·格雷厄姆（Lindsey Graham）更进一步，建议现在就对朝鲜进行打击 — — 在朝鲜政权开发出将核武器送往美国所需要的导弹之前。	Senator Lindsey Graham has gone so far as to recommend launching a strike against North Korea now – before the regime can develop the missiles needed to deliver nuclear weapons to the US.
随着中国，印度和其他新兴国家的快速崛起，他们在IMF的作用也应该得到加强，应该在2011年的计划中应该得以体现。	The rapid growth of China, India, and other emerging countries should come with increased influence, to be implemented through the planned quota increase in 2011.
美国正威迫欧洲各国采取更多的财政刺激手段，而欧洲政府则对美国进行施压，让美国在全球更大范围以更大力度对金融规范进行调整。	The US is hectoring Europe for more fiscal stimulus, while the Europeans pressure the US for greater and more globally coordinated financial regulation.
但是漠视从而导致鼓励普京在国际舞台上推行他违法的方式就变成了姑息迁就，就像他正在推行的试图扼杀格鲁吉亚经济的运动。	But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia’s economy.
如果两国的经济继续以它们现在的速度增长，中国将在30年后超过美国，然而即便到那时美国的人均国民收入也会是中国的四倍。	If both countries’ economies continue to grow at their current rates, China’s could be larger than America’s in 30 years, but US per capita income will still be four times greater.
巴黎—说来也巧，美国国会有可能在9月11日左右决定是否支持奥巴马就叙利亚政府对平民使用毒气采取军事行动的方案。	PARIS – By chance, it appears that the US Congress will decide on or around September 11 whether to endorse President Barack Obama’s proposal to respond militarily to the Syrian government’s use of poison gas against civilians.
对于中国经济突出的坚韧性，一个常规的解释是它拥有巨大的国内储蓄池和外汇储备（超过3万亿美元 ） ， 可以用来消除金融恐慌。	A common explanation for China’s apparent invulnerability is that it has large pools of domestic savings and enormous foreign-exchange reserves (over $3 trillion), which can be spent down to head off financial panics.
美国政治界 — — 不仅是共和党，也包括民主党（尽管程度稍浅 ） — —总是对不吉利的现实视而不见。	The American political world – not only Republicans, but also Democrats (albeit to a lesser extent) – had fenced out huge, ominous realities.
但欧元债券是解决欧元危机根源 — — 加入欧元让成员国政府债券暴露在违约风险之下 — — 的显而易见的方案。	Yet they are the obvious solution to the root cause of the euro crisis, which is that joining the euro exposed member countries’ government bonds to the risk of default.
在伊拉克，遭遇这一命运的是多是拉美裔美国人，对他们来说，融入美国社会 — — 对其中很多人来说，这包括永久定居权或入籍承诺 — — 的重要性至少不亚于推翻萨达姆·侯赛因。	In Iraq, their equivalents were very often Latinos for whom integration into American society – including, for many, the promise of permanent residence or citizenship – was at least as important as toppling Saddam Hussein.
这也是为何过去几个月的讨论大多 — — 如果没有异议的话 — — 集中在如何支持意西两国的调整和改革之上。	That is why discussions over the last few months have largely, if implicitly, been about how to support adjustment and reform in Italy and Spain.
男性倾向于冒险（特别是年轻的时候 ） ， 这或许有生物学方面的原因，但社会规范通过将冒险和阳刚之气相联系助长了高风险和不健康的行为。	While there may be a biological component to men’s propensity for risk taking (especially among young men), gender norms reinforce risky or unhealthy behaviors by associating them with masculinity.
在执行共同政策方针方面的重点权力已经委托给欧盟委员会，而欧盟理事会则将自身权力限定为在获得符合条件的多数成员支持的情况下否决委员会的提议。	Key powers over the implementation of common policy guidelines have been entrusted to the European Commission, and the European Council has limited its own ability to reject Commission recommendations by requiring a qualified majority to change them.
在“坏帐银行”模式中，政府管理其收购的所有不良资产又带来新的问题，因为政府没有专长经验来完成这一任务。	In the “bad bank” model, the government has the additional problem of managing all the bad assets that it purchased – a task for which it lacks expertise.
为解决这个问题，密克罗尼西亚联邦计划今后五年内在所属水域的每条延绳钓船上安装远程传感器、GPS定位系统、摄像及跟踪设备。	To remedy this, FSM plans to deploy remote sensors, GPS systems, cameras, and tracking devices on every longline vessel in its waters within five years.
持续增长需要制定相应的发展策略作为支撑，但大多数发展中国家且尚未制定一个类似的策略，因此也无法确保他们能进一步缩短与发达国家之间的经济差距。	Sustained growth requires a growth strategy, and most developing countries do not yet have one that would put them irrevocably on the path of economic convergence.
欧盟机构是否足够强大，能够面对这些挑战？ 我们是否必须重新考虑 — — 有可能还要重建 — — 欧洲合作的支柱？	Are European institutions strong enough to confront that challenge, or must we reconsider – and potentially recast – the pillars of European cooperation?
反之，面临增长缓慢问题的美国则乐于维持极高的消费水平，但这样的代价是个人储蓄下降、房地产泡沫越吹越大，并在破灭后留下了满目疮痍。	By contrast, the US, in the face of slow growth, was content to sustain exceptionally high levels of consumption at the expense of personal savings, inflating a massive housing bubble that burst with a very large and deeply disturbing bang.
看似无可辩驳的理论模型支撑着一个范式，这个范式已经发生了重大变化，如果维持下去，注定会导致严重的政治问题。	Seemingly irrefutable theoretical models underlie a paradigm that has changed in significant ways, and that, if preserved, is bound to cause serious political problems.
这一分歧在经济和社会政策上尤其尖锐，但也扩展到了其他领域，如教育政策（比如延长教育还是早早地分流 ） 。	This division remains particularly acute in economic and social policy, though it also extends to other areas, like education policy (for example, extended education versus early specialization).
我们显然需要采取更着眼点更宏大的外交手段并从位处这一问题核心的根本点入手：即各方还未签署一项和平条约来结束1950~53年的朝鲜战争。	Clearly, a broader diplomatic approach is needed, and it should start by addressing a fundamental issue at the heart of the problem: namely, that no peace treaty has ever been signed to end the 1950-1953 Korean War.
正统量化宽松 — — 让我们称之为“货币化一号 ” — —是有逆���操作的打算的，用税收筹集资金回购央行所持有的政府债券。	Orthodox QE – let’s call it “monetization one” – is intended to be reversed, with taxation used to raise the money to redeem the government bonds held by the central bank.
这些学术会议有助于激发对耐药性的伦理问题的学术兴趣，但远远不足以帮助世界安全度过近在眼前的道德雷区。	These scholarly gatherings have helped to foster academic interest in the ethical considerations of drug resistance, but represent only a tiny fraction of what is needed to help the world safely navigate the looming moral minefield.
2007至2016年间，标准普尔500指数中的19家制药公司（截至2017年1月）花了2,970亿美元用于回购股份和提振股价，从而提升高管股票期权的价值。	Between 2007 and 2016, the 19 pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 as of January 2017 spent $297 billion repurchasing their own shares to boost their stock price, and thus the value of their executives’ stock options.
此外，尽管研究者尚未发现支持任何一种理论的结果，但他们通过更好地定义任何引力的量子理论都必须考虑的观察标准推动的科学进步。	And, though researchers may not have found results supporting any one theory, they have advanced the cause of science by better defining the observational criteria any quantum theory of gravity will have to take into account.
尽管长期停滞在2008年金融危机发生五年后成了一种模因（meme ） ， 但这个术语本身的历史要悠久得多。	Although secular stagnation became a meme five years after the 2008 financial crisis, the term itself is much older.
它们可以出口喷气机发动机，超级计算机，飞机以及所有种类的计算机芯片，唯独没有它们做得来而且实际生产产品，如纺织品、农产品或者加工食品。	They can export jet engines, supercomputers, airplanes, computer chips of all kinds—just not textiles, agricultural products, or processed foods, the goods they can and do produce.
年初，当布什要求削减开支 — — 包括一项包含将来减少福利的社会保障改革 — — 的时候，世界上的投资者们就料到布什会得逞，至少在很大程度上如此。	When Bush asked for spending cuts at the beginning of the year – including a social security reform that includes cuts in future benefits – world financiers expected that Bush would get his way, or most of it.
美国是唯一一个同时参与两大谈判的国家，它面临着一个选择：要么推动两大谈判齐头并进，要么牺牲其中一个谈判成就另一个。	As the only party to both initiatives, the US is well placed either to move them forward in harmony or to leverage the progress of one negotiation against the other.
相反，区域和全球资本加大对教育、医疗、可再生能源、农业和基础设施的投资才是为中东和世界建设更稳定未来的真正关键所在。	By contrast, a surge of investment in education, health, renewable energy, agriculture, and infrastructure, financed both from within the region and globally, is the real key to building a more stable future for the Middle East and the world.
这还能带来工作时间的减少，最终实现马克思的梦想 — — 一个技术进步让个体能够“在早上打猎，在下午钓鱼，在黄昏喂养家畜、在晚饭后指点江山 ” 。	It would also allow working hours to be reduced – finally approaching Marx’s dream of a society in which technological progress enables individuals to “hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner.”
1919年，经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）描绘了住在伦敦的英国人用电话从世界各地定购商品，然后就在家里坐等下午接收。	In 1919, the economist John Maynard Keynes described the possibility of an Englishman in London using a telephone to order goods from around the world to be delivered to his house by the afternoon.
而且因为就连社会党派也卖力地推动自由经济政策，那么有着民族主义和保护主义背景的极右势力借社会问题渔利也就毫不奇怪了。	And, since even socialist parties pushed liberal economic policies, it is not surprising that the far right, with its nationalist and protectionist overtones, has hijacked the social question.
该国政府在经济景气的时候并没有预留资源，因此它现在就缺少像其他国家政府那样实施积极的公共开支刺激计划所必需的财政空间。	The government did not set aside resources while things were going well, and now it does not have the fiscal space needed for an aggressive boost to public spending of the type that many other governments are attempting.
与全世界的左翼一样，法国左翼也支持高程度的国家控制经济以及以技术官僚而不是自由主义解决方案对付社会和经济问题。	Like leftists everywhere, the French left favors a large degree of state control of the economy, together with technocratic rather than liberal solutions to social and economic problems.
而更重要的是通胀预期已经开始动摇。 经济预测专家和投资者们都预期这种无法达到目标的状况将一直维持到中期。	Even more important, inflation expectations have started to de-anchor: forecasters and investors expect the undershooting of the target to persist over the medium term.
最初认为是一个国家（意大利）的问题，像多米诺骨牌一般推倒了其他国家的汇率：英国、西班牙、葡萄牙，到了1993年7月，连法国都摇摇欲坠。	What was initially seen as a problem in one country (Italy) toppled other currency regimes like dominos: Britain, Spain, and Portugal – and, by July 1993, even France was vulnerable.
而加拿大 — — 其金融体系由五家大银行主宰 — — 比几乎其他所有国家都更轻松地度过了2008—2009年全球金融危机。	Yet Canada, with a financial system dominated by just five large banks, sailed through the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 more easily than almost any other country.
尽管对这两大因素谁更重要还存在争议 — — 诚然，要作出比较十分困难 — — 但可以确定地说，这两大因素都起到了促进美国复苏的作用。	Though analysts differ on the relative importance of these two factors – and, indeed, it is difficult to weight them – it is safe to say that both played a role in facilitating the US recovery.
在英国，利率上限直到1835年才被取消；2009年以来央行普遍采取了近零利率则是保护债务人的最新例子。	Interest-rate caps were abolished in Britain only in 1835; the near-zero central-bank rates prevailing since 2009 are a current example of efforts to protect borrowers.
这将使让巴基斯坦迈出扎实的政治步子，胜过其他目前也处于类似局面（即建立更具可问责性的治理）但进展甚少的穆斯林大国。	This would put Pakistan on sounder political footing than several other large Muslim countries, which are currently engaged in similar – but far less successful – efforts to institute more accountable governance.
令问题更加棘手的是，特朗普治下的美国似乎无法继续遏制俄罗斯或支持其一手创造的1945年后的自由世界秩序。	Compounding the problem, it seems that the United States under President Donald Trump cannot be counted on to continue constraining Russia or underwriting the post-1945 liberal world order that it created.
提议中的防御公约本来还要通过一个欧洲政治共同体计划来加强。 该共同体的主要特点将会通过一个由各国议会组成的宪法委员会来明确。	The proposed defense treaty was also to be buttressed by plans for a European political community whose main features were to be defined by a constitutional commission made up of members of national parliaments.
与此同时，金融市场正在迫使各国政府采取财政整顿措施，计划中的新财政条约（为德国和其他一些国家所坚持）亦然。	At the same time, financial markets are forcing fiscal retrenchment on governments, as will the planned new fiscal treaty (on which Germany, among others, insisted).
虽然马哈蒂尔在北京发出的反对“新版殖民主义”警告因大胆而引人注目，但它们反映了对中国这种重商主义贸易，投资和贷款行为的一种更广泛抵制。	While Mahathir’s warnings in Beijing against “a new version of colonialism” stood out for their boldness, they reflect a broader pushback against China’s mercantilist trade, investment, and lending practices.
此外，MBS成功收服了所有这些部门，同时仍然能够在形式上遵守沙特王室严格的家规和错综复杂的层级制度。	Moreover, MBS managed all of this while still formally adhering to the Saudi royal family’s strict protocols and elaborate codes of hierarchy.
即便国际核聚变实验堆能获得成功，人们解决了氚和材料的问题，所有的东西也还需要进行实际规模的测试，只有到那时才能开始建造工业级反应堆的第一个样板。	Even if ITER is successful, and if one solves the tritium and material problems, everything would need to be tested in real size, and only then could a first prototype of an industrial reactor be built.
尽管身体内的所有细胞的NDA都是相同的，但是不同的细胞类型只含有带有DNA密码的某个基因子集，这样就产生了皮肤细胞、肝细胞和脑细胞之间的区别。	Though all cells in the body have the same DNA, only a subset of the genes encoded by the DNA is expressed in each cell type, thus accounting for the difference between, say, a skin cell, a liver cell, and a brain cell.
直接比较不同种类的能源发电难度很大，因为一天内的不同时间风能、太阳能、核能和化石燃料的使用并不一致。	Direct comparisons of different power sources are difficult, because the use of wind, solar, nuclear, and fossil-fuel plants varies according to the time of day.
结果，一些共和党著名政客敦促该党反思其反移民政策，而奥巴马也计划在第二个任期伊始便将移民改革列入日程。	As a result, several prominent Republican politicians are now urging their party to reconsider its anti-immigration policies, and plans for immigration reform will be on the agenda at the beginning of Obama’s second term.
因此，我们看到了共和党候选人泰德·科鲁兹（Ted Cruz ） 、 兰德·保罗（Rand Paul）和麦克·哈卡比（Mike Huckabee）要求美联储固定黄金美元价格的方案。	Thus, we have proposals by Republican candidates Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Huckabee to require the Fed to maintain a fixed dollar price of gold.
对已有子女、抵押贷款和其他财务责任的中年劳动者来说，必须接受以周或月、而非年计的培训，同时接受上述培训的资金支持也是不可或缺的。	For mid-career workers with children, mortgages, and other financial responsibilities, training that is measured in weeks and months, not in years, will be necessary, as will financial support to undertake such training.
第二年秋天，也就是2000年，下一批学生也选择了《哈利波特与魔法石》作为期末分析著作，就像之前的同龄人一样，他们自信地拒绝接受这部著作。	The following autumn, in 2000, the next cohort of students also picked Sorcerer’s Stone for the final text, and, like their peers, they confidently dismissed it.
因此，他的方案与联合国政府间气候变化专门委员会和联合国环境规划署（UNEP）提出的方案类似，两者都认为全球变暖超过一定限度将会带来真正的灾难。	As such, his approach is also similar to that of the IPCC and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), both of which have concluded that global warming above a certain level will have truly disastrous effects.
另一个要求是它们的团队必须具备更加专业的投资技能，与其他国内投资者紧密协作，以使收购对各自国家经济产生乘数效应。	It also requires that they equip their teams with more investment expertise and coordinate closely with other domestic investors so that their acquisitions can have a multiplier effect on their respective national economies.
美联储前主席本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke）指出，要是中国等国家支出更多，那么几乎让美国破产的泡沫一开始就不会形成。	As former US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke put it, if only countries like China had spent more, the bubbles that nearly broke America would not have formed in the first place.
许多非洲国家也表现出一个广泛的模式，包括良好的宏观经济规则，持久的加速增长，经济多样化以及高昂的投资者信心。	Many African countries, too, are showing a broad pattern of sound macroeconomic fundamentals, durable growth acceleration, economic diversification, and investor confidence.
最大的金砖经济体中国也陷入了结构性减速，其经济增长率在未来两年中将向5%靠拢（目前为7%以上 ） 。	The biggest, China, is in the midst of a structural slowdown that will push its growth rate closer to 5% in the next two years, from above 7% now.
部分原因也许在于，对主要新闻组织而言，这些评估通常是根据安全顾问的意见进行的 — — 这些安全顾问往往是男性退伍军人，未必能充分理解女性所面临的特殊风险。	This may be partly because, for major news organizations, these assessments are often handled in consultation with safety advisers – usually former military men, who may not fully appreciate the particular risks women face.
不仅如此，梅休并没有发现表明衍生品市场在基础现金市场中造成波动的证据，而事实情况却恰恰相反，衍生品市场能够对基础现金市场的波动起到缓解作用。	Moreover, he found that there is no evidence that derivative markets create volatility in underlying cash markets; in fact, they may even reduce it.
SPD根据形势反弹，采取骑墙态度，并最终让步，因为默克尔手握有力的规训工具：她可以要求举行新选举，CDU可能获得全面胜利。	The SPD will recoil at the prospect, sit on the fence, and finally give in, because Merkel has a powerful disciplinary instrument: she could call a new election, in which the CDU would probably win an outright majority.
在没有直接承认美国在引发金融危机中的主要作用的情况下，美国联邦储备系统已经分别为韩国、巴西、墨西哥和新加坡的中央银行提供了高达300亿美元的货币互换。	Without directly acknowledging America’s central role in causing the financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve has already offered to exchange up to $30 billion each with the central banks of Korea, Brazil, Mexico and Singapore.
1968年法国出现的大规模抗议活动导致提前举行议会选举，而戴高乐的支持者在议会选举中赢得了决定性的胜利。	The massive protests in France in 1968 led to an early parliamentary election, which de Gaulle’s supporters won decisively.
由于美国政府的大部分债务都在外国投资者手里，这个预测意味着他们将在未来十年内吸收超过6万亿美元的美国债券。	Because foreign investors hold the majority of US government debt, this projection implies that they will absorb more than $6 trillion in US bonds during the next ten years.
此外，欧盟已向挪威和瑞士等非成员国明确表示，要想进入欧盟单一市场，唯有接受其大部分规则，包括人员自由流动和为欧盟预算出资。	Moreover, the EU has made clear to non-members such as Norway and Switzerland that they can have full access to the single market only if they accept most of its rules, including the free movement of people, and contribute to the EU budget.
而现在，因为确认巨额援助资金被盗，这种悲伤的情绪又掺杂了愤怒和失望 — — 这样的不满既针对欺诈行为本身，也针对这件事所体现出来的非洲改善医疗机会和成果的斗争现状。	And now, with confirmation that huge sums of aid were stolen, the grief is compounded by anger and disappointment – at the fraud itself, but also for what it says about Africa’s struggles to improve health-care access and outcomes.
过去十年来，该地区内部贸易流出现了爆发式增长，但其主要模式是零件和半成品输入中国，再由中国组装后出口发达国家。	Intra-regional trade flows have surged during the last decade, but they have been concentrated in parts and components that go into finished products assembled in China for export to developed countries.
按照创始人杰弗里·萨克斯的说法，雄心勃勃的千禧村概念本应在多方面同时取得进展 ， “ 用三年或者更少的时间创造出重大的成果 ” 。	The ambitious Millennium Villages concept was supposed to create simultaneous progress on multiple fronts, producing “major results in three or fewer years,” according to founder Jeffrey D. Sachs.
在完全独裁的制度下，公共知识分子、自由派政党和公民社会机构都被镇压；而在不自由民主中，它们只是受到干扰，但大多仍然存在。	Under outright autocracy, public intellectuals, liberal parties, and the institutions of civil society are crushed; under illiberal democracy, they are harassed, but mostly survive.
正如人类基因编辑国际峰会最近所指出的那样，在达成广泛的社会共识前就继续进行对生殖细胞编辑的临床应用是不负责任的行为。	As the International Summit on Human Gene Editing recently stated, it would be irresponsible to proceed with a clinical use of germline editing without broad societal agreement.
比如，在大部分欧洲各国家，大约每1,000名病人有30名医生为他们服务；在尼日利亚，这一比例为4:100,000。	For example, in most European countries, there are roughly 30 doctors for every 1,000 patients; in Nigeria, that ratio is closer to 4:100,000.
但奥巴马也同时意识到，如果现有的核武国家希望其他国家接受更严格的管制，他们就必须削减自己的核武器数量。	But Obama also knows that if the existing nuclear states want others to accept tougher restrictions, they will have to cut back their nuclear arsenals.
冷战结束迄今已将近25年，我们依旧摆脱不了冷战时期的遗留战略：核武器继续支撑着世界最强国的国际安全政策。	Nearly 25 years after the Cold War’s end, we remain stuck with its strategic legacy: Nuclear weapons continue to underpin the international security policy of the world’s most powerful states.
直到2014年，欧盟在2004年所进行的“大爆炸”式扩张可谓成功，在中欧和东欧的经济和政治平稳快速转型中起到了重要作用。	By 2014, the EU’s “big bang” enlargement in 2004 could be hailed as a success story, having contributed significantly to swift and peaceful economic and political transition in Central and Eastern Europe.
但不论是2008年金融危机，还是随后的欧元危机（因公共债务过多引起 ） ， 都没有导致受影响国家出现大规模去杠杆化或熊彼特式创造性破坏。	But neither the 2008 crisis nor the subsequent euro crisis, which was caused by excessive public debt, led to significant deleveraging or Schumpeterian creative destruction in the affected countries.
有时这一风险包括众所周知的政府与企业之间的“旋转门 ” ， 即私人部门高级岗位与高级官员岗位之间的人事互换。	Sometimes the risk entails the proverbial “revolving door” between government and business, through which personnel glide from senior private-sector jobs to top official posts and back again.
欧元区最终教会了IMF什么？ 是公共和私人债务的积累有害于增长、与过去相比，它应该极大地提高对债务减记和重组的强调吗？	Has the eurozone crisis finally taught the IMF that public and private debt overhangs are significant impediments to growth, and that it should place much greater emphasis on debt write-downs and restructuring than it has in the past?
几乎是在同时，登盛还给出了一个更加强烈的信号，表明这一届政府是一个完全不同的政府：他释放了一批政治犯，并邀请昂山素季和他展开直接对话。	Almost simultaneously, Thein Sein offered even stronger signals that his was a very different Burmese administration: he freed political prisoners and invited Suu Kyi for direct talks with him.
更为重要的是，中国呼吁引入全新储备货币是因其懊恼于美国和欧洲等主要国家政府无力在管理自己的经济事务时表现出现实的态度和良好的判断力。	Most importantly, China’s call for the introduction of a new reserve currency stems from its frustration with the failure of major governments – whether in the US or Europe – to govern their economic affairs with realism and good sense.
与韩国的扶贫经验相似，非洲千禧村及其他类似计划正在大幅提升粮食产量、改善儿童健康状况，并打造一条可持续的脱贫之路。	Like South Korea’s own experience in fighting poverty, Millennium Villages in Africa, and similar projects elsewhere, are now surging ahead in food production, children’s health, and in forging a sustainable pathway out of poverty itself.
就像烟草文件将烟草业赶出决策过程一样，埃克森调查应促使世界领导人将化石燃料行业清除出解决气候危机的进程。	Just as the tobacco files drove the tobacco industry out of policymaking processes, the Exxon investigation should compel world leaders to eliminate the fossil-fuel industry from efforts to solve the climate crisis.
反过来，很多伊朗人把奥巴马视为力争颠覆伊朗政权的美国温和派，而将其前任乔治·W·布什视为美国最诚实、也最激进的代表人物。	Many Iranians, in turn, regard Obama as the friendly face of a US that still seeks regime change in their country, whereas his predecessor, George W. Bush, was America’s more honest – because more radical – representative.
而限制州所得税和房产税的减免额度几乎肯定会压低对教育和基础设施的投资 — — 这也不是一个提高美国国家竞争力的合理策略。	And limiting the deductibility of state income tax and property tax will almost surely reduce investment in education and infrastructure – again, not a sound strategy for increasing American competitiveness.
我们需要最终并完全地批准《里斯本条约 》 ， 以打造一个我们所需要的在制度上和国际上都更强大的欧洲。	We need final and complete ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in order to have the institutionally and internationally stronger European Union we need.
人们普遍认为是谋杀命令是由沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（Mohammed bin Salman）下达的。	Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is widely believed to have ordered the killing.
巴基斯坦是否被沿着伊斯兰极端主义和紧急状态管治的道路上拖下去，还是最终实现现代化，成为民官领导下的世俗国家？	Will Pakistan be dragged along the path of Islamic extremism and emergency rule, or finally achieve modernity as a secular nation under civilian leadership?
中国千年以来一直是世界最大的国家，19世纪中叶以前也一直是最大的经济体，主要原因是有众多的生产者和客户。	China has been the world’s largest country for millennia, and until the mid-nineteenth century it was the largest economy, too – mainly because it had so many consumers and producers.
但台湾人并不那么笃定 — — 他们看着现在的香港正在发生什么。 1997年回归中国前，香港也得到了同样的承诺。	But the Taiwanese cannot be very reassured by what they see happening today in Hong Kong, which was promised the same thing before its return to China in 1997.
还有不那么宽容的解释，那就是现代援助史中的富国议会吝啬到不愿为贫困国家直接提供赠款，而只有得到还钱的许诺后才可能同意帮忙。	A not-so-generous interpretation of modern aid history is that rich countries’ legislatures were too cheap to give outright grants to the poorest countries, and could be persuaded to help out only if they were told that the money would be repaid.
中国在非洲经济中所发挥的作用也曾受到批评；但正如我之前所说的那样，中国投资一直维系着非洲大陆许多人的生命。	China’s role in African economies has been criticized; but, as I have argued before, Chinese investment has also been a lifeline to many on the continent.
此外，在1929~1932年股市出现有史以来最大跌幅之前的市场高点时期，12个月的实际收益增长率为18.3 ％ 。	Moreover, at the market peak just before the biggest ever stock-market drop, in 1929-32, 12-month real earnings growth stood at 18.3%.
首先，这将产生一个拥有庞大市场职能的国家资产负债表，提振就业，刺激创新，并推进整个经济体的结构转型。	First and foremost, it would reconcile a large state balance sheet with an expanding role for markets, bolstering employment, stimulating innovation, and advancing the economy’s structural transformation.
第二，他坚信市场和自由贸易的力量，而这两者在过去本个世纪中在减轻贫困上发挥的作用明显要比任何援助项目都大。	Second, he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade, which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half-century than any aid program.
发自马尼拉 — — 1980年，我父亲在独裁者费迪南德·马科斯的牢狱迫害之下心脏病发，前往美国接受搭桥手术。	MANILA – In 1980, my father arrived in the United States to undergo a heart bypass, due to the rigors of his imprisonment by the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.
不难想象可能出现拒绝握手或拿出一张账单这样的情景，一如特朗普据报道对德国总理默克尔做的那样（白宫否认了这则报道 ） 。	It wasn’t hard to imagine a refused handshake or the presentation of a bill for payment, like the one Trump reportedly gave visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel (a report denied by the White House).
只有日本，1971年8月战役的首要目标，遭受了沉重打击。 这被日本人称作第二次“尼克松休克 ” ， 第一次是几个月之前，尼克松突然宣布将于1972年访问中国大陆。	Only the most obvious of the targets of August 1971, Japan, was badly hit by what the Japanese called the second “Nixon shokku” (the first being Nixon’s announcement the previous month that he would visit mainland China in 1972).
但是，也许重要的还要数朝鲜独裁统治的支柱之一目前已经开始崩塌 — — 而与此同时，该国极有可能将再次面临人为的严重食物短缺。	But, perhaps most important, one of the pillars of the North Korean dictatorship may now be cracking – at a time when the country must once again cope with a severe, man-made food shortage.
毕竟，以两国制方案为基础且剥夺1948年后难民“回归权”的巴勒斯坦人真正的和平努力将激怒哈马斯并重燃派系暴力，从而在众多的失败中再加上一个砝码。	After all, genuine peace efforts by the Palestinians – based on a two-state solution with no “right of return” for post-1948 refugees – would enrage Hamas and revive factional violence, adding another self-defeat to an already long list.
更有甚者，他还和俄罗斯在今年年底达成协议，将减少战略武器的续约进一步落实，并将无核化议题提交联合国和20国集团讨论。	Moreover, he followed up by negotiating with Russia a successor to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by the end of this year, and has moved the non-proliferation issue to the top of the agenda at the UN and the G-20.
今后一年 — — 特别是9月在杭州举行的G-20峰会期间 — — 中国准备为建设更加“创新、活力、联动、包容”的世界经济奠定基础。	Over the next year – and especially at the organization’s September summit, to be held in Hangzhou – China plans to help lay the groundwork for a world economy that is more “innovative, invigorated, interconnected, and inclusive.”
在花旗集团（Citigroup）则成为标准普尔500指数成分股中第一家多数股东拒绝了管理层薪资计划的公司。	At Citigroup, a majority of shareholders rejected managers’ pay at Citigroup – the first S&P 500 company at which that happened.
早在2003年，当时格里高利·曼昆出任小布什总统的首席经济顾问，他就提到过经济刺激方案，这并不是什么高深的问题。	As N. Gregory Mankiw said of a stimulus package back in 2003, when he was President George W. Bush's chief economic advisor, this is not rocket science.
如果国家转型计划想要实现更大程度的经济多元化，沙特阿拉伯有必要利用出口导向的高附加值增长，并最终实现更深层次的地区和国际融合。	If the NTP is to deliver greater economic diversification, Saudi Arabia will need to harness high value-added, export-led growth and, eventually, greater regional and international integration.
如果它们不想让增长减速，让劳动力迟迟得不到吸收，让社会不稳定风险与日俱增，那么他们就必须果断地将注意力转向该地区内部的35亿消费者。	Unless they want to settle for slower growth, lagging labor absorption, and heightened risk of social instability, they must move aggressively to shift focus to the region’s own 3.5 billion consumers.
华盛顿—两百年前，华盛顿被英国人攻陷，入城的英国人随后放火烧了包括白宫、财政部和国会在内的公共建筑。	WASHINGTON, DC – Two hundred years ago, Washington DC was captured by the British – who then proceeded to set fire to official buildings, including the White House, Treasury Department, and Congress.
作为越来越担心西方针对伊朗核设施的军事行为的反应，革命卫队首脑最近大大强硬了其针对美国和以色列的语言立场。	Reacting to mounting fear of Western military action against Iran’s nuclear facilities, Revolutionary Guard commanders recently sharpened their rhetoric against the US and Israel.
但由于英国央行认为经济已经充分发挥其潜力，所以尽管GDP增长缓慢且估计从现在到2021年（其预测期的最后一年）间仅能实现1.7~1.8％的年均增长率，它仍毅然选择加息。	But, because the BoE believes the economy is already growing at its full potential, it has raised interest rates now, even though GDP growth is slow and is estimated to only reach 1.7-1.8% between now and 2021, the end of its forecast period.
在2010年以前签署一项具有强大约束力的全球性协议将在未来几十年规划出行动路线。 这在几个月以前还不大可能，而现在很有可能得到落实。	Though unlikely just a few months ago, a strong global agreement by 2010, one that will set a path for action for decades to come, now stands a good chance of being implemented.
大多数新的一代俄罗斯妇女和男子也是如此。 在她们现代和算计的头脑中已经没有了牺牲的位置，无论牺牲是为了家庭、艺术、文化或者科学。	So do most of the new generation of Russian women (and men): in their modern, calculating minds, there is little place for sacrifice, whether for family, art, culture, or science.
虽然日本的人口下降确实带来了挑战，但这也可能意味着一些优势：同时日本的债务也远比它们表面上看更具可持续性。	While Japan’s demographic decline poses challenges, it may also imply some advantages: and Japan’s debts are far more sustainable than they appear.
在这方面，欧盟必须起到领导作用，释放出应有的强硬信号，立即承认巴勒斯坦国 — — 就像70%多的联合国成员国已经做过的那样。	Here, the EU must take the lead and send a message that is as forceful as it is necessary, by immediately recognizing – as over 70% of UN member states have already done – the State of Palestine.
初始报告收集了来自十多家欧洲政府的18份方案，主题涵盖了新海底光缆、加密、本地化数据储存、国内产业支持、国际行为准则和数据保护法律等。	An initial report identifies 18 proposals from more than a dozen European governments on subjects including new undersea cables, encryption, localized data storage, domestic industry support, international codes of conduct, and data protection laws.
同时，监管者应该根据风险的大小，区分商用和民用抵押贷款的借贷价值比例（loan-to-value ratio ） ， 划分相应的风险等级，以防止房地产泡沫的产生。	Similarly, financial authorities should vary the loan-to-value ratio on commercial and residential mortgages for risk-weighting purposes in order to forestall real estate bubbles.
然后他可能会解雇大批官员，更严厉的对待移民，并试图停止穆勒对其选举团队与克里姆林宫可能的串通以及特朗普可能的阻挠司法行为的调查行动。	He might then fire a raft of officials, treat immigrants still more harshly, and try to shut down Mueller’s investigation of his campaign’s possible collusion with the Kremlin and Trump’s probable obstruction of justice.
事实上，同政界牵扯不清是欧式家族资本主义的两大软肋之一 — — 企业主寻求政治优势和人脉的热情不亚于搞技术革新。	Indeed, political entanglements are one of two sources of weakness in European-style family capitalism, as owners seek political advantages and preferred access as much as they strive for technical innovation.
但直到领导层在2012-2013年换届之前，中国的政策制定者们都将继续在罔顾巨额未来成本的情况下维持一个高增长率。	Until the change of political leadership in 2012-2013, China’s policymakers may be able to maintain high growth rates, but at a very high foreseeable cost.
惟其如此，对人民币的压力，以及对中国外汇储备的压力才会有所减少，因为国内外投资者将能够看清楚未来情况。	Only then will the pressure on the renminbi, and on China’s foreign-exchange reserves, subside, because investors both within and outside the country will see a clear way forward.
当美国试图通过硬权力、改变政权、制裁和以先发制人的武装干涉相威胁来达到其目的时，欧洲却采用了软权力、外交、接触和伙伴关系的策略。	While the US tries to achieve this through hard power, regime change, sanctions, and threats of pre-emptive military intervention, Europe uses soft power, diplomacy, inclusion, and partnership.
安卡拉—土耳其正在加紧打击叙利亚库尔德武装的军事行动，很容易将这些暴力归咎于土耳其总统艾尔多安的高调的沙文主义和仇外主义。	ANKARA – As Turkey intensifies its military campaign against Syrian Kurdish fighters, it is tempting to blame the violence on President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s strident jingoism and xenophobia.
除了维持利率低于市场水平之外，政府还为汽车、机械以及钢铁等几个行业提供优先廉价信贷渠道，优惠税收待遇和公共投资支持。	Beyond keeping interest rates below market levels, the government offered the automobile, machinery, and steel industries, among others, preferential access to cheap credit, favorable tax treatment, and public investment support.
实际上，随着十二世纪和十三世纪欧洲大学崛起，规模更小、速度更慢、而且更为不完整的维基百科社区出现了。	Indeed, a much smaller, slower, and more fragmented version of the Wikipedia community came into existence with the rise of universities in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Europe.
在里加举行的东欧伙伴关系峰会可以而且必须证明欧洲有决心在俄罗斯侵略面前捍卫自身的统一、安全和价值观。	The EU Eastern Partnership summit in Riga can and must demonstrate Europe’s determination to defend its unity, security, and values in the face of Russian aggression.
直升机撒钱将把风险从政府资产负债表转移到央行资产负债表，模糊政策、机构和它们之间的相对自主权之间的界线。	Helicopter money would transfer risk from governments’ balance sheets to those of central banks, blurring the lines between policies, institutions, and their relative autonomy.
连通性因素 — — 如互联网、金融市场、航空枢纽或物流中心 — — 助长了全球化效应的“超级传播 ” ， 有利也有弊。	The vectors of connectivity – such as the Internet, financial markets, airport hubs, or logistics centers – facilitate “super-spreading” of globalization’s effects, both positive and negative.
这个想法听起来合乎逻辑，因为有一个可以让他安居乐业的好工作，人是不会与美国人或者他的伊拉克同胞交战的，对不对？	The idea sounds logical: a man with a good job that enables him to build a decent life won’t want to fight Americans or his fellow Iraqis, right?
新的物权法如果不能配以普通公民有更多诉求公正的途径，那么它就不会成为政府所标榜的维护权利的一个突破。	The new property law won’t be the breakthrough for rights protection that the government claims it is until it is matched by increased access to justice for ordinary citizens.
而麦利亚德公司只不过是把这个发现稍微提早了一点，却因其无情追求经济利润所的行为削弱了这两个基因的社会效益。	The social benefits of Myriad’s slightly earlier discovery have been dwarfed by the costs that its callous pursuit of profit has imposed.
特别是俞正声、张德江和张高丽，他们来自中国最强大、最有活力的三个都市中心 — — 上海、重庆和天津。	That is especially true of Yu Zhengsheng and the two Zhangs, Dejiang and Gaoli, who come from senior roles in three of China’s most powerful and dynamic urban centers – Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin.
事实上，在如何实现突破这个问题上美国人有自己的想法，尤其在是对付以色列这个奥巴马政府当前认定的头号障碍方面。	Instead, the Americans have their own ideas about how to achieve a breakthrough, especially with Israel, which the Obama administration believes is now the major obstacle.
他简单地接受了孟克关于千年村计划（Millennium Villages Project）失败的论断。	He simply accepts Munk’s assertion that the Millennium Villages Project – an ongoing development project across more than 20 African countries – has failed.
如果他们要负责公司的方方面面，那就不能在自己的巨额薪酬方案为外界所知时仅仅凭借一句“我值这么多钱”来逃避责任。	If they are responsible for all aspects of the company, then they cannot abdicate responsibility with a “Because I’m worth it” attitude when news of their large pay packages becomes public.
但它同时也也忘记了1990年代 — — 也是第一个所谓“失落的10年 ” — —再此期间当局尽其所能延长资不抵债的银行和许多非金融公司的寿命。	But it has also lost sight of the 1990’s – the first of its so-called lost decades – when the authorities did all they could to prolong the life of insolvent banks and many nonfinancial corporations.
最后，民主党人必须确保任何增加的支出或转移支付 — — 包括工资保险 — — 都能得到支付，而且不是在全面扩大预算赤字的情况下。	Finally, Democrats must ensure that any increased spending or transfers – including wage insurance – is paid for, rather than being allowed to blow the budget deficit wide open.
但海牙法庭和二次大战后纽伦堡法庭之间的对比正在日渐消失：由于审判迁延日久，观察家们怀疑为什么用了那么长时间来确立战争责任。	But comparisons to the post-WWII Nuremberg tribunal have worn thin: as the proceedings drag on, observers wonder why it has taken so long to establish criminal liability.
西方决策者并没有表现出开明的领导力，反而一直不能直面事实，他们的反应混合了否认、错误诊断和有害无利的扯皮，使人难以摸着头脑。	Rather than exhibiting enlightened leadership, Western policymakers have consistently lagged realities on the ground, with a bewildering mixture of denial, misdiagnosis, and bickering undermining their responses.
不仅仅是政府，宗教和其他组织的领导人也应该被劝说来谴责恐怖主义，是那些进行恐怖活动的人感到羞耻，并且宣布他们的非法的。	Not just governments, but religious and other leaders need to be persuaded to denounce terror, shaming and de-legitimizing those who carry it out.
即便是劳动力问题也是可以解决的，只要来自前苏联中亚地区 — — 甚至可能逐渐自由化的朝鲜 — — 的工人能够参与地区开发所需要的雄心勃勃的项目。	Even the labor problem is solvable, with millions of workers from former Soviet Central Asia – and perhaps from a gradually liberalizing North Korea – able to take part in the ambitious development that will be needed.
玻利维亚如果能以其��侧邻国巴西为榜样会取得不错的发展，巴西在20世纪80年代实现民主化后，教育和科技投资都有了长足的进步。	Bolivia would do well to follow the example of its eastern neighbor, Brazil, which has experienced a surge in educational and scientific investments since its democratization in the 1980’s.
最后，2016年通胀率又回到40 % ， 与此同时，此前用来掩盖真实通胀率的扭曲性价格补贴也被取消。	It finally jumped back up to 40% in 2016, propelled by the removal of distortionary price subsidies that had previously been used to disguise the true inflation rate.
1990年代法国在波斯尼亚惨痛的维和经历是他们这种担忧的来源。 在这次行动中法国失去了在限制性“交战规则”指导下执行人道主义使命的84名维和士兵。	The terrible French peacekeeping experience in Bosnia in the early 1990s, in which France lost 84 soldiers serving in a humanitarian capacity under restrictive ROEs, justifies their fears.
纽约—2008年，金融危机爆发后不久，决策者成功地阻止了大衰退滑向第二次大萧条，秘诀就在于阻止了保护主义者和内向政策的要求。	NEW YORK – In the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, policymakers’ success in preventing the Great Recession from turning into Great Depression II held in check demands for protectionist and inward-looking measures.
我们捷克人对此有所了解，因为我们在九十年代经历了艰苦的经济转型，告诉了我们许多道理，也就是正确的政策可以打破绝望钳制。	We Czechs know something about this, as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the 1990’s taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness.

但其实我们可以去建立一个，而G20则是最明智的起点 — — 至少它可以提供适当水平的指导以协助推进外国直接投资政策。	But one can be built, and the G20 is the most sensible place to start. At the very least, the G20 can offer the appropriate level of guidance to help advance FDI policy.
事实上，某些类型的资本流动管理 — — 包括限制企业和家庭以外币计价的国内债务 — — 都被证明能增加抗冲击能力。	Indeed, certain types of capital-flow management – including limiting domestic debt denominated in foreign currency for both firms and households – have been shown to increase resilience.

自2009年以来，在全球化和技术进步的支持下，全球人均GDP每年增长2.5 % — —比大衰退开始前要低，但从历史上看仍然是相当高的水平。	Globalization and technological progress have supported annual global per capita GDP growth of 2.5% since 2009 – lower than before the Great Recession, but still very high by historical standards.
实验经济学家发现，被要求参加分配游戏的实验对象处于倒数第二的位置时，他们会对境况坏于他们的人非常吝啬。	Experimental economists have found that subjects asked to play distribution games become much less generous toward those below them when they are in second-to-last place.
但是，即使欧元区有所缩小并且预算程序有所改进，欧元所面临的基本问题 — — 强迫情况各异的多个国家在单一货币政策和单一汇率安排下运行 — — 仍然无法消除。	But, even with a smaller group of member countries and some changes in budget procedures, the fundamental problems of forcing disparate countries to live with a single monetary policy and a single exchange rate will remain.
如果富国的政府们以实际的方式来思考疟疾的问题，并承认它是一个全面的紧急事件，那么它们就可以支持简单而实用的解决方案：蚊帐和及时可得的药物。	If rich-country governments thought practically about malaria and recognized that it is a full-scale emergency, they could support simple and practical solutions: bed nets and timely access to medicine.
所有这一切都凸显了一场不断深化的道德领导力危机，由此可能造成的损害丝毫不亚于不受控制的移民甚至贸易战。	All of this highlights a deepening crisis of ethical leadership that could do as much damage as uncontrolled migration or even a trade war.
确切地说，布什强化了这两种趋势，但究其原因还在于客观的历史因素，也就是自1989年以来美国在世界上的一家独大和欧洲自作自受的软弱。	To be sure, Bush reinforced both trends, but their real causes lie in objective historical factors, namely America’s being the sole world power since 1989 and Europe’s self-inflicted weakness.
实际上，中国需要一个强大独立的欧洲。 而且从这一点上来看，中国现在直面一个真正多极化的全球体系为时并不太早。	Indeed, China wants a strong and independent Europe, and from that vantage point it is not too early for China to envisage a truly multi-polar global system.

也就是说，被认为是人们相互间的语言、行动以及情感流动的体验，不仅是本地的，而且具有内在的道德性，因为我们的生活就是有关赋予价值和表现价值的。	That is to say, experience, viewed as the flow of words, movements, and emotions between us, is not only local, but also inherently moral, because living our lives is about animating and enacting values.
美国总统特朗普的政府也愿意为他出面，至今依然拒绝承认他在卡舒吉谋杀中的作用并拒绝如外界所呼吁的那样对沙特实施制裁。	And US President Donald Trump’s administration is standing by its man, so far refusing to acknowledge his role in Khashoggi’s murder and resisting calls for sanctions against Saudi Arabia.
“从现在起20年后 ， ” 伊曼纽尔在纽约告诉其它与会市长，我们将看到“民族国家衰落的拐点，而像新加坡这样的城市国家则转而推动文化和经济活动 。 ”	“Twenty years from now,” Emanuel told fellow mayors in New York City, we will see “an inflection point where the nation-state is in decline, and the city-state à la Singapore is driving the cultural and economic activity.”
感到美国相对衰落和欧洲对其价值和模式的信心的日渐深刻的损失导致了通常建立在昔日反美主义遗留的基础上的立场的合理化。	The perception of relative US decline and the EU’s deepening loss of confidence in its values and model seem to legitimize a stance that is built in many cases on the remnants of older anti-Americanism.
Airbnb和在线旅行社Expedia只允许实际使用过服务的客户评价；这有可能成为整个共享经济的监管规范。	Airbnb and the online travel agent Expedia allow reviews only by customers who have actually used their services; that could become a regulatory norm throughout the sharing economy.
我研究过给个人的此项福利占总收入（指“调整后总收入 ” ， 美国税法简称AGI）的百分比设置“上限”的想法。	I have explored the idea of “capping” the benefit that individuals can get as a percentage of their total income (their “adjusted gross income,” or AGI in US tax parlance).
对安倍来说，夏威夷与奥巴马握手等于认同日本的现代和平主义信念，并释放出一个信号：尽管以民族主义者闻名，但他对战争的危险也有着深刻的认识。	By shaking Obama’s hand in Hawaii, Abe will give a nod to the country’s modern pacifist creed, and signal that, despite his reputation as a nationalist, he also harbors deep feelings about the dangers of war.
尽管普京并未明言猎犬的优劣代表了俄美两国的实力，但上述评论却与他所传递的总体信息如出一辙：永远也不要胆敢质疑我们的力量。	Though Putin barely implied that the dog’s superiority indicates Russia’s domination over the US, his remark appears to be in line with his general message: don’t you ever dare to doubt our high status.
那些经常账户赤字数额巨大的国家（印度，南非，以及从波罗的海国家到土耳其的位于东欧的20多个国家）会因为全球信贷紧缩受到不利影响。	Those with large current-account deficits (India, South Africa, and more than 20 economies in East Europe from the Baltics to Turkey) may suffer from the global credit crunch.
一战后以及1980年代和1990年代的下降势头很猛；相反，朝鲜战争后的降幅相对较弱，当时正逢世界经济的繁荣期。	The downswings following World War I and in the 1980’s and 1990’s were strong; in contrast, the dip after the Korean War, when the world economy was booming, was relatively weak.

我听到的说法似乎根本无事可做：叙利亚的防御系统太过强大、问题太过复杂、而且为什么要在没有更好方案的情况下做出选择？	I hear people talk as if nothing can be done: the Syrian defense systems are too powerful, the issues too complex, and in any event, why take sides when one is as bad as the next?
相反，所有以马克思主义的名义拒绝资本主义的体制，都遭到了失败 — — 这不是巧合，也不是因为马克思的信徒不幸地错误理解了马克思的思想。	By contrast, every regime that has rejected capitalism in the name of Marxism has failed – and not by coincidence or as a result of some unfortunate doctrinal misunderstanding on the part of Marx’s followers.
在今年早些时候举行的纽约第14区民主党初选中，民主社会主义人士亚历山大·奥卡西奥·科尔特斯击败了现任众议院议员、在众议院排名第四的民主党人约瑟夫·克劳利。	In the Democratic primary election for New York’s 14th district earlier this year, democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trounced incumbent Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House.
目前为止，历史上还没有非西方的现代化。 有关亚洲价值观的讨论最初起源于新加坡，这基本上是一个政治性讨论。	So far, there is no case in history of non-Western modernization; the discourse on Asian values, initially started in Singapore, is basically a political discourse.
受到西方支持的专制政权多年来把任何可能会取代在位的阿拉伯政权的成长中的自由主义运动都扼杀在襁褓之中，并且任何突然推行的自由选举都演变成伊斯兰民主危险的实施。	Years of Western-backed repressive authoritarianism nipped in the bud any potential growth of a liberal alternative to the incumbent Arab regimes, and turned any abrupt move to free elections into a dangerous exercise in Islamic democracy.
十年后，FBI马上号召所有参与波士顿马拉松的人提供重点线周边区域的照片和视频 — — 只要能够帮助调查者识别投弹者。	A decade later, the FBI immediately called on all who attended the Boston Marathon to send photos and videos of the area around the finish line – anything that could help investigators identify the bombers.
一个无法将自己的孩子与异国他乡的陌生儿童区分开来的人 — — 自觉对两者都有同样的爱和责任 — — 大概也就失去人性了。	An individual who didn’t distinguish between his or her own child and an unknown child in a faraway land – who felt the same love and the same obligation toward both – would hardly be human anymore.
为了维持增长，中国需要继续将其9万亿美元的年度GDP用于投资 — — 这对一个遍地新建高速公路和机场的国家来说实属不易。	In order to sustain growth, it needs to continue to invest half of its $9 trillion annual GDP – no easy task for a country that already has brand new highways and airports.
事实上，一些欧盟领导人对于移民等问题所采取的方针有可能创造系统性问题，哪怕特朗普回归他的充斥着高尔夫和破产事务生活，也会长久存在下去。	In fact, some EU leaders’ approaches to issues like immigration are threatening to create systemic problems that will endure long after Trump has returned to a life of golf courses and bankruptcy courts.

10月，俄罗斯驻联合国大使丘尔金（Vitaly Churkin）表示，美国所领导打击伊斯兰国行动不把伊朗和叙利亚包括在内是不妥的，他把这两个国家称为“打击地区恐怖主义的天然盟友 ” 。	In October, Russia’s United Nations ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, faulted the US-led initiative against the Islamic State for its failure to involve Iran and Syria, which he called “logical allies in the fight against terrorism in the region.”

法庭认为，该法律合理的目的是为具有特殊困难的学生作出教学调节，并且，心理测试看上去是足够客观，并未牵涉到种族偏见。	According to the Court, the law’s legitimate purpose is to adapt teaching to the difficulties of a specific category of pupils, and psychological tests seem to be objective enough not to be suspected of racial bias.
有时候领导人就需要突破现实的藩篱去激励追随者并激发出额外的效应，如同温斯顿·丘吉尔1940年在英国所做的那样。	Sometimes leaders need to stretch the boundaries of realism to inspire their followers and call forth extra effort, as Winston Churchill did in Great Britain in 1940.
一旦他们意识到他们不能威吓ECB进行不必要的自我消亡式的利率降低，欧盟领导人也许能鼓起领导的勇气 — — 这毕竟是他们被选举出来所要完成的任务。	Once they realize they can’t bully the ECB into unwanted and self-destructive interest rate cuts, EU leaders actually might summon up the will to lead—which is, after all, what they have been elected to do.
每个人都有不同的看法，我将提供我自己的2012中东综述，并给出2013年的建议，如果我们想让损失少些的话。	While there have been many prescriptions, I will provide my own 2012 Middle East roundup, with a look toward what must happen in 2013 if we want it to bring fewer losses.

尽管如此，对于金正恩，巴里·戈德华特 — — 另一位局外人转变而来的共和党标志性人物 — — 54年前的智慧仍然成立 ： “ 唯一有可能成功的峰会是没有开成的峰会 。 ”	Nonetheless, when it comes to Kim, a bit of 54-year-old wisdom from Barry Goldwater, another outsider-turned-Republican Party icon, still applies: “The only summit meeting that can succeed is the one that doesn’t take place.”
事实上，纵观历史，政府存在强烈的政治激励将赤字货币化，由此产生的通货膨胀降低了财政负担（以及对被借走的储蓄的实际没收 ） 。	In fact, throughout history, governments have had strong political incentives to monetize the deficit, with the subsequent inflation reducing the debt burden (and effectively confiscating the borrowed savings).
但超级病菌也对现代医学的有效性构成了威胁;如果不解决这一问题，抗生素耐药性会导致更多的感染无法治愈，癌症疗法失效，常规手术无法进行，甚至连分娩也变得不安全。	But superbugs also pose a threat to the effectiveness of modern medicine; if left unaddressed, AMR could make more infections untreatable, cancer therapies ineffective, routine surgeries impossible, and even childbirth unsafe.
但如若美国变得不再热心于世界事务，只愿意付出象��性的代价 — — 俄罗斯的以牙还牙式的制裁就是明证 — — 来阻止威胁到国际社会的入侵会怎样？	But has the US become so withdrawn from the world that it is willing to pay only a symbolic price, such as that implied by Russia’s tit-for-tat sanctions, to stop aggression that threatens the international order?
一个显著的例子是食品供给。 在这一领域，科技在持续生产着日益复杂的转基因食品，而科学家对这些食品的评估才刚刚开始。	A leading example is food supply – an area where technology has continually produced ever-more highly processed and genetically refined food that scientists are only beginning to assess.
今天，巴林的逊尼派统治者鄙视卡塔尔与伊朗的友好关系，指责伊朗伊斯兰共和国挑拨在巴林国内占绝大多数的什叶派人口。	Today, Bahrain’s Sunni rulers despise Qatar’s friendly ties with Iran, accusing the Islamic Republic of fomenting unrest among Bahrain’s majority-Shia population.

类似地，特朗普承诺减少向外国盟友提供资金，以此作为“美国第一”整体战略的一部分，这可能让它们对他当选总统感到不悦。	Likewise, Trump’s promise to reduce funding to foreign allies, as part of a broader “America first” strategy, should be tempering their joy at his victory.

因为如果这些资源都是通过美国自身援助机构拨付的话，相关政策制定就将随着历任政府更替所导致的发展思维变化（或者不作为）而摇摆不定。	Had these resources been channeled through America’s own aid agency, policymaking would have been subject to the vagaries of development thinking (or the absence of reflection) from one administration to another.
也许如广为流传的那样，他在电视上看到死去的和垂死挣扎的儿童的画面时受到了很大的触动；但阿萨德血腥方针的视频证据一直都有。	He may indeed have experienced a spasm of emotion when he saw images of dead and dying children on TV, as has been widely reported; but visual evidence of Assad’s bloody methods has long been available.

JP摩根大通CEO杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）在2015年致股东的信中说得好 — — “硅谷”正在逼近。	Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed it well in his 2015 shareholder letter, observing that “Silicon Valley” is coming.
报告警告说，即使按气候变化移民的最低估计量2,500万人计算 ， “ 也将让当前新难民和国内流民水平小巫见大巫 。 ”	Even the lowest estimate of 25 million climate-change migrants, the report warns, “would dwarf the current levels of new refugees and internally displaced persons.”
作为一个政府办事员的女儿，玛雅瓦提曾攻读法律并做过教师，后来被社会报党（ BSP ）的创始人，已故的Kanshi RAM 发现，并培养了她的政治领导才能。	The daughter of a government clerk, Mayawati studied law and worked as a teacher before being spotted by the BSP’s founder, the late Kanshi Ram, and groomed for political leadership.
但要在美国挑战这个国会“特权”却相当困难，这在某种程度上是因为内幕交易在美国法律中是个模糊概念，同时对“内幕交易者 ” ， “内部信息”或者“内幕交易”都缺乏法律定义。	But it is difficult to challenge this congressional “privilege” in the US, in part because insider trading is an ambiguous concept under US law, with no statutory definitions of the terms “insider,” “inside information,” or “insider trading.”
正如中国的工业化是前所未有的 — — 没有哪个发展中国家可以在整整二十年的时间里不间断地保持每年10%以上的增长，200年前英国的工业化也是前无古人。	Just as Chinese industrialization is unprecedented – no developing country has grown by more than 10% per year without interruption for two full decades – Britain’s industrialization 200 years ago was similarly unparalleled.
里斯本中心大学最近一项海洋学研究表明二氧化碳排放所导致的酸化可能导致到2100年全球鲨鱼数量骤降40 % 。	A recent study by the University of Lisbon’s Center for Oceanography reports that acidification from CO2 emissions could cause the global shark population to decline by as much as 40% by 2100.
这些进步部分可以归因于创新，包括只需要几分钟的新型快速诊断测试、更普及和廉价的抗疟疾药物，以及越来越普遍的长效防虫蚊帐（LLIN）的使用。	Progress can be attributed partly to innovations, including new rapid diagnostic tests that work in just minutes, more accessible and affordable anti-malarial drugs, and rising use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs).
但是，阿萨德已经从2005年叙利亚被迫从黎巴嫩撤离的挫折中成功走了出来，并且成为一个没有他就无法建立黎巴嫩政府、无法选举黎巴嫩总统的中间人。	But Assad managed to emerge from Syria’s forced withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005 to become the broker without whom a Lebanese government could not be created and a president could not be elected.
目前的局势迫在眉睫：核武器不仅仅在拥有核的国家手中，一旦落入无国界的恐怖分子手中 — — 由此可能导致的局面无法想象。	The urgency can hardly be exaggerated: nuclear weapons may come into the possession of states that might use them, as well as of stateless terrorists – creating new threats of unimaginable proportion.
同时，水资源过滤系统、抗旱种子、可再生能源和互联网等现代技术完全可以比任何帝国更好地满足我们这个拥挤星球的基本需求。	At the same time, technologies like water filtration systems, drought-resistant seeds, renewable energy, and the Internet have the potential to fulfill the basic needs of a crowded planet better than any empire could.
在托尔斯泰看来，拿破仑算不上特别出色的将军，他的胜利应该归功于打赢波罗底诺战役的法国士兵的勇气和献身精神。	As far as Tolstoy was concerned, Napoleon was not a particularly good general, and was carried to victory by the courage and commitment of all of the individual French soldiers who won the Battle of Borodino.
在10月份在北京举行的中共十九大上，习近平主席宣布中国进入了“新时代 ” ， 将中国的治理体系作为可供其他国家效仿的模式呈现。	In declaring a “new era” for China during October’s 19th National Congress in Beijing, President Xi Jinping presented the Chinese system of governance as a model for other countries to emulate.
这种批评在那些专制国家尤其常见，他们的统治者和为它们的体制极力辩护的人把普遍人权看成是对他们专制统治的威胁。	To be sure, such accusations are especially common in autocracies whose rulers, and their apologists, view the idea of universal human rights as a threat to their monopoly on power.
但为了最大限度地提升能提供上述技能和机会的工作效率，更不要说确保那些留在非正式行业工作的人不成为政府监督的盲点，就仍然需要开展直接改善数据搜集效率的工作。	But to maximize the effectiveness of efforts to provide those skills and opportunities, not to mention ensuring that those who remain in the informal sector are not invisible, initiatives aimed directly at improving data collection are also needed.
早在20世纪70年代后期，全世界都面临滞涨风险的时候，德国总理施密特（Helmut Schmidt）固执地跟英、法、美国的领导人说，他们搞赤字财政是错误而危险的。	In the late 1970’s, when the world was facing a mixture of stagnant growth and inflation, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt insistently told British, French, and American leaders that their deficits were wrong and dangerous.
甚至非常支持自由贸易 — — 甚至TPP的某些版本 — — 的人，比如伯格斯坦和加尼翁，也认为某些亚洲国家的行为已经超过了合理的边界。	Even people who are very much in favor of freer trade – and even of some version of the TPP, like Bergsten and Gagnon – believe that some Asian countries have overstepped the boundaries of reasonable behavior.
出版主张强硬外交政策、反外国的文章总是能引发密云不雨的民族敏感情绪，并很容易地将其演变为大爆发，其结果就是带来显而易见的利益。	Publishing jingoistic, anti-foreign articles plays to national sensitivities that always simmer, and thus can easily be brought to a boil, with obvious benefits for the bottom line.
即将卸任的总理马里奥·蒙蒂（Mario Monti）所领导的政府完成了主要的养老金改革、削减了公共支出并提高了税收。	Outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government accomplished a major pension reform, cut public spending, and raised taxes.
这次袭击的目标是基地组织二号人物扎瓦赫里。 尽管据报道这一恐怖组织中级别较低的人物被炸身亡，但是他并没有被炸死。	The target of the attack, Al Qaeda’s number two man, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was not among the dead, although lesser figures in the terrorist organization reportedly were.
在这一能源一体化过程中，银行联盟可以提供如何确保共同利益以及在欧盟主要机构 — — 欧盟委员会、欧洲议会、欧洲理事会和欧洲央行 — — 取得平衡的经验。	In this process of energy integration, the banking union offers clues about how to secure common interests and maintain a balance among the EU’s main institutions – the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Council, and the ECB.
存在的问题很多，但是我们还是把它们看成是“家务事 ” ： 许多夫妇会为这样的事情发生争执，但是绝对不会想到要为此离婚。	The list is long, but they might best be thought of as “housekeeping” issues: many a couple can quarrel over them without contemplating divorce.
果真如此的话，那么姗姗来迟十年的欧盟新全球外交和安全政策战略（Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy）就是一件大好事。	If so, then the European Union’s new Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, more than a decade overdue, must be a very good thing.
随着共产主义的垮台，雅尔塔会议所创造的分裂的欧洲已经不见踪影，而欧盟的扩张也不再局限于属于西方阵营的国家。	With communism’s collapse, the divided Europe created at Yalta disappeared, and EU expansion was no longer confined to states belonging to the Western orbit.
一国的成功 — — 不论用其皇帝的荣光、其领土的扩大、其边界的安全，还是其人口的福利来衡量 — — 都取决于其人民的健康。	A country’s success – whether measured by the glory of its Kaiser, the expansion of its territory, the security of its borders, or the well-being of its population – rests on the health of its people.
中国的支持者们指出1998年的《欧盟关于武器出口的行为规范》能有效限制军火销售，但是他们想当然地忽略了一个事实，即该行为规范属于“自愿”性质，对各成员国不具强制性。	China apologists claim that the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is sufficient to limit arms sales. But they conveniently ignore the fact that the Code of Conduct is voluntary and thus not enforceable.
而且，在伦敦20国首脑会议的预备阶段，该组织彻底地对其贷款政策进行了革新，不再强调一贯执行的制约性，让实行了让各国能容易获得贷款的方法。	And, in the run-up to the G-20 summit in London, it thoroughly overhauled its lending policies, de-emphasizing traditional conditionality and making it easier for countries to qualify for loans.
但经合组织的2012 年报告发现，土耳其学生的较低考试分数中只有15%可以归因于社会经济地位，优于经合组织平均水平。	But the OECD’s 2012 report found that only 15% of lower test scores among Turkish students could be explained by their socioeconomic standing, a better outcome than the OECD average.
尤其是中国在过去十多年中奉行了一个创造大量经常账户顺差并积累外汇储备的战略，使其当前的外汇储备总额达到3万亿美元之巨。	In particular, China has followed a strategy in the past decade or so that entails running large current-account surpluses and building up foreign-exchange reserves, which are now reported to be in excess of $3 trillion.
尽管死于这场海啸灾难的达到200，000人之多，可每月还有同样数目的非洲儿童死于疟疾，我把这场灾难称之为“沉默的海啸 ” 。	But, while more than 200,000 people perished in the tsunami disaster, an equivalent number of children die each month of malaria in Africa, a disaster I call a “silent tsunami.”
习近平的政治未来取决于其兑现改革承诺的能力，因此最应该防范的就是被对外政策转移了注意力 — — 更不用说灾难性的军事实例了。	With his political future depending on his ability to deliver on his reform promises, the last thing Xi needs is a foreign-policy distraction – let alone a disastrous military misadventure.
所有这些都是一个成功，这不仅对废除死刑的极端人士而言如此，而且对于废除死刑协会、意大利政府、欧盟及其在全世界的朋友而言也是如此。	All this is a success, not only for anti-death penalty radicals, for the “Hands off Cain” association, the Italian government, and for the European Union and its friends in the world.
从现在到2015年9月各国首脑齐聚联合国大会期间，我们拥有一个历史性机会为世界设计更加可持续的道路，从而消灭贫困、改善所有人的前景。	Between now and September 2015, when heads of state will gather for the UN General Assembly, we have a historic chance to set the world on a more sustainable path that will eradicate poverty and enhance prosperity for all.
因此，莫拉莱斯的统治是三大标志性领域的成功融合：民族主义情绪、对穷人的关注和玻利维亚人越来越强烈的民族自豪感。	Thus, Morales’s leadership brought together three strongly symbolic dimensions: nationalist sentiment, concern for the poor, and emerging ethnic pride among Bolivia’s native peoples.
最新北约数据表明，2017年德国在防务设备和研发方面的支出只有GDP的0.17 % ， 而法国为0.42 % ， 英国为0.47 % 。	The latest NATO data show German spending on defense equipment and on research and development running at only 0.17% of GDP in 2017, compared to 0.42% in France and 0.47% in the UK.
对以色列而言这意味着永久性的占领西岸和东耶路撒冷，从而不得不面对在数量上远胜于己的阿拉伯人，而这将削弱他们建国的基础 — — 民主和法治 — — 进而影响其地位的合法性。	For Israelis, this would mean permanent occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and thus reckoning with an Arab majority, which would erode the foundations of their state – democracy and the rule of law – and thus its legitimacy.
虽然没有那种比较是完美的，但最贴切的莫过于将特朗普比作贝卢斯科尼，这位意大利媒体大亨在国内连续三届担任总理。	While no comparison is perfect, the most apt comparison is with Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul who has served three terms as his country’s prime minister.
学者们将陷于现有方法 — — 即该学科中已被接受的语言和假设 — — 无法自拔，他们的研究也将陷入循环和琐碎的无用功。	Scholars can become so trapped in their methods – in the language and assumptions of the accepted approach to their discipline – that their research becomes repetitive or trivial.
在马来西亚，代理银行监管（保护消费者利益，同时支持金融机构的业务模式）帮助无分支银行业务进入此前无法提供服务的农村地区。	In Malaysia, agent-banking regulation (which safeguards consumers’ interests while supporting financial institutions’ business models) has led to the expansion of branchless banking to reach previously unserved rural areas.
此外，阿根廷政府还加入了雄心联盟（High Ambition Coalition ） ， 该联盟是确保2015年巴黎气候协定缔结成功的重要因素。	Furthermore, the Argentine government now participates in the High Ambition Coalition, which was instrumental in securing the 2015 Paris climate accord.
加利福尼亚州其实正面临着一个两难困境：一面是当前过分严厉的政策带来的巨大政府开支和社会犯罪，二是合法交易后吸食者增加所带来的负面影响，而大麻政策则试图两害相权取其轻。	Marijuana policy involves a choice between the evils of current repressive policies and the evils of increased use under a legal market.
习近平的反腐运动已经“拿下”了中国权力最大的“大老虎 ” — —中共政治局常务委员会的一位退休委员。	Xi’s anti-corruption campaign has gone as far as taking down a retired member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China’s most powerful body.
如此规模在全球劳动力市场的汪洋大海中只算得上一片小浪花，只相当于被信息技术“自动化”掉的岗位数量的零头。	These are mere drops in the ocean of the global labor market, replacing very few of the jobs that information technology has automated away.
非洲农业部门要想实现它的承诺 — — 如果非洲想要继续经济增长 — — 决策者就需要考虑乔伊斯这样的农民的需要。	If Africa’s agricultural sector is to achieve its promise – and if Africa’s economic growth is to continue – policymakers should take into account the needs of farmers like Joyce.
幸运的是，中国领导人意识到如果坐视世界经济深陷资产负债表衰退状态，那么因国际贸易形势持续疲软而导致的全球总需求缺乏就将进一步拖累中国的经济增长。	Fortunately, China’s leaders recognize that, if the world remains mired in a balance-sheet recession, the lack of aggregate demand, by continuing to weaken trade, will drag down their own country’s growth.
在印度人民党的忠实信徒看来，统治印度数百年的穆斯林是外来侵略者，他们掠夺了富饶的土地，摧毁了寺庙和宫殿，奴役和歧视印度教徒，奸淫印度教妇女，并迫使数百万人皈依了伊斯兰教。	To BJP true believers, the Muslims who ruled India for centuries were foreign invaders who despoiled a prosperous land, destroyed temples and palaces, enslaved and discriminated against Hindus, assaulted Hindu women, and converted millions to Islam.
作为这些资金的交换 — — 这些资金往往被用于耗资巨大的国家工程甚至政治选战 — — 财阀能获得有利的条件，比如廉价银行贷款和有利的监管规则。	In exchange for that money, which is used to finance costly state projects or even political campaigns, the chaebols gain favors, such as cheap bank loans or preferential regulations.
约翰·凯恩斯说 ， “ 长期看，我们都死了 ， ” 这固然正确，但人的一生确确实实是一段相当长的时间。	John Maynard Keynes was correct that “in the long run we are all dead,” but the human life span can be quite a long run, indeed.
这并不是说巴基斯坦的伊斯兰主义者即将走上复兴之路，或者巴基斯坦人必须在一个不受欢迎的独裁者和一个塔利班式的政府之间做出选择。	This is not to suggest than an Islamist awakening in Pakistan is on the horizon, or that Pakistanis must choose between an unpopular autocrat or a Taliban-style government.
这雷区的形式可能是不透明的全球信用泛滥，其背后的推手是由“大而不能倒”的全球银行体系和规模巨大但几乎不为人知、不受监管的影子银行部门所组成的脆弱混合体。	It is likely to take the form of an opaque global credit glut, turbocharged by the fragile mixture of too-big-to-fail global banking with a huge and largely unwatched and unregulated shadow banking sector.
与此同时，对粮食、饲料和燃料生物质的全球需求在不断增加，这反过来推高了土地的价值 — — 这一事实从未逃脱国际投资者的目光。	At the same time, global demand for food, fodder, and biomass for fuels is growing, in turn driving up the value of land – a fact that has not escaped international investors’ attention.
他还推出了一份以市场为导向的医疗保险法案，该法案是仿效罗姆尼在担任马萨诸塞州共和党州长期间实行的法案而推出的。	And he pushed through a market-oriented health-care bill modeled after legislation that Mitt Romney had enacted while serving as the Republican governor of Massachusetts.
“我知道你们的生意现在相当好 ， ” 他说 ， “ 这个国家在过去几个月总是缺少点精气神，而现在全都有了 。 ”	“I know your business is now doing very well,” he observed, “and there’s a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren’t having so much in the last number of months that you have right now.”
如果真的如此，对丘吉尔的怀旧恐怕很难与美国的活力扯上关系，而更像是一个衰落国家一场浪漫而又徒劳无益的战斗。	If so, nostalgia for Churchill is hardly a sign of American vitality, but more like a romantic rearguard battle, typical of a country in decline.
答案在于中国所遇到的前所未有的挑战，包括腐败、污染、不可持续的地方债务 、 “ 鬼城 ” 、 影子银行、效率低下的国有企业、政府对经济的过度控制等。	The answer lies in the unprecedented challenges that China faces, including corruption, pollution, unsustainable local debts, ghost towns, shadow banks, inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and excessive government control over the economy.
某些试点项目已经将这些工具和政策成功纳入中低收入国家由捐款人赞助的艾滋病毒/艾滋病及其他传染性疾病项目。	Pilot programs have successfully integrated these tools and policies into donor-funded programs on HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries.
大多数人仅仅是偿还房屋按揭贷款，交纳法定的国家或者私人养老金(如果他们有的话 ) ， 再有存一些钱用于不时之需。	Most people just pay off their mortgage, make the mandatory contributions to their state or private pension (if they have one), and keep some money for short-run contingencies.
但如果你像我一样认为过去八年的慢增长主要原因是债务积压以及2008年危机所引起的恐慌，那么就不难相信正常化也许比我们所认为的近得多。	But if one believes, as I do, that the slow growth of the last eight years was mainly due to the overhang of debt and fear from the 2008 crisis, then it is not so hard to believe that normalization could be much closer than we realize.
（欧洲央行行长之职落到了另一位经济学家技术官僚德拉基身上，事实上，他可以说是这一位子的理想之选。 ）	(The ECB presidency then went to another economist and technocrat, Mario Draghi, who is, in fact, the perfect man for the job.)
片中最重要的人类角色威尔·罗德曼（由詹姆斯·弗朗克扮演）是一位用人猿作实验品来寻找老年痴呆症疗法的科学家。	The central human character, Will Rodman (played by James Franco), is a scientist seeking a cure for Alzheimer’s disease who experiments on apes.
在与南苏丹总统基尔（Salva Kiir）的多次谈话中，我们讨论了为这个新国家设定明确优先事项短名单的事项。	In many conversations with South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, we have discussed setting out a short list of clear priorities for the new state.
对福岛核电站来说，一波千年一遇的海啸和一个平时不太要紧的设计瑕疵碰到了一起，最终引发几座反应堆冷却水断供并导致严重核辐射泄漏。	For the Fukushima nuclear-power plant, a 1,000-year flood and ordinarily innocuous design defects combined to deprive the reactors of circulating water coolant and cause serious radiation leaks.
在第二次辩论中，人们显然接受了旧奥巴马的消失和新奥巴马的初次登场 — — 存在的、真实的、触手可及的、在椭圆办公室工作的奥巴马。	At the second debate, the loss of the old Obama was apparently accepted and a new one –existing, real, available, and now working in the Oval Office – made its first appearance.
更具竞争力的汇率增加了日本出口商的利润，却没有增加它们的产出，而日元贬值也导致进口价格上升，降低了大多数日本家庭的实际收入。	The more competitive exchange rate raised the profits of Japanese exporters, but not their output, while the weaker yen also raised import prices, reducing the real incomes of most Japanese households.
录像公布后特朗普的民调支持率大幅下降，而候选人否认自己曾抚摸或袭击女性对本党选情造成了雪上加霜的后果 — — 他的表态迫使数名女性站出来否定他。	Trump’s drop in the polls since the tape’s release has changed that, and the candidate has made matters worse for his party by denying that he has groped or assaulted women – a claim that impelled numerous women to come forward and say otherwise.
在这一新的竞争环境中，石油将像任何普通大宗商品一样交易，沙特阿拉伯的垄断将被打破，北美的生产成本将给长期价格带来每桶50美元左右的上限，原因我在1月已经讨论过了。	In this newly competitive environment, oil will trade like any normal commodity, with the Saudi monopoly broken and North American production costs setting a long-term price ceiling of around $50 a barrel, for reasons I set out in January.
先进国家通常所青睐的知识产权标准不是为了最大限度地实现创新和科学进步，而是致力于最大限度地扩大大型制药企业以及其他能够左右贸易谈判者的得利。	The IP standards advanced countries favor typically are designed not to maximize innovation and scientific progress, but to maximize the profits of big pharmaceutical companies and others able to sway trade negotiations.
这一点相当重要，因为其揭示了由于地域差异所造成的拉丁美洲和加勒比海地区在对华贸易上的差异。 南美洲基本物资的出口和中国对于墨西哥出口的持续增长是造成这一现象的原因。	This is important because it illustrates the dissimilar regional impact that trade with China has on Latin America and the Carribean, owing to the export of South America’s basic goods, coupled with the growth of Chinese imports into Mexico.
当世界上有许多国家都能按动核按钮时要维护和平会变得尤其困难 — — 而一旦失败所带来的后果将是毁灭性的。	Maintaining peace in a world in which literally dozens of fingers are on nuclear triggers will be far more difficult—and the consequences of failure far more destructive.
包括巴西、俄罗斯、印度、墨西哥、阿根廷、泰国、印尼、马来西亚和中东石油出口国在内的其他新兴市场经常账户盈余自20世纪90年代初起就显著增加。	Other emerging markets – including Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Middle Eastern oil exporters – have all increased their current-account surpluses significantly since the early 1990’s.
定向压迫、关押反对派领导人、新闻审查、短缺、通货膨胀和暴力肆虐 — — 加拉加斯已成为世界上最危险的城市之一 — — 从中期看，局面已难以为继。	Targeted repression, imprisonment of opposition leaders, press censorship, shortages, inflation, and wanton violence – Caracas is one the world’s most dangerous cities – have created a situation that appears untenable in the medium term.
但有一点越来越明晰：那就是过于强大或先天存在缺陷的知识产权可能实际上会阻碍创新¾而且阻碍的方式绝不仅仅限于增加研究成本。	But it has become increasingly clear that excessively strong or badly formulated intellectual property rights may actually impede innovation – and not just by increasing the price of research.
现在，在中国共产党管理经济的能力似乎在经受考验的时候，它的一揽子经济刺激计划意味着，在人们的工作机会或经济增长目标受到威胁的时候，中国可以为绕开环境保护开绿灯。	Now, with the Party’s ability to manage the economy seemingly at stake, its stimulus package implies a green light to bypass environmental regulations if jobs or growth targets are in jeopardy.
该课程基本上属于一门法证宏观经济学（forensic macroeconomics）课程 — — 从现代日本经济的兴衰中提炼一些核心经验教训，然后找出那些教训与其他主要经济体的相关性。	The course is primarily one in forensic macroeconomics – distilling key lessons from the rise and fall of the modern Japanese economy and then figuring out the relevance of those lessons for other major economies.
与此同时，数字支付系统 — — 欧美的PayPal，Venmo等系统；中国的支付宝和微信；肯尼亚的M-Pesa；印度的Paytm — — 都能提供原本归属于传统商业银行的有吸引力的替代服务。	At the same time, digital payment systems – PayPal, Venmo, and others in the West; Alipay and WeChat in China; M-Pesa in Kenya; Paytm in India – offer attractive alternatives to services once provided by traditional commercial banks.
塞浦路斯银行只需要提供微不足道的风险溢价，就能够在欧洲任何地方筹集任何数量的客户资金，转动比过去更大的财富之轮。	Banks in Cyprus would be able to collect any amount of customer funds from anywhere in Europe by offering minimal risk premiums, allowing them to spin an even bigger wheel of fortune than they did in the past.
（另外一个被选中的国家伊拉克同样被原来的禁穆令所激怒；其他目标国包括利比亚、索马里、苏丹、叙利亚和也门 ） 。	(Iraq, one of the other states singled out, was equally incensed by the original order; the other countries targeted were Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen).
虽然协议条款规定以三年为限，但乌克兰政府实际放弃了对顿巴斯地区的控制权，并将该地区交给由俄罗斯雇佣的分离主义分子。	Under that agreement, Ukraine’s government ceded de facto control of the Donbas region, supposedly for only three years, to Russia’s hired secessionists.
尽管有关政府和央行急着想对策，但有一种深刻的心理机制阻碍着债务问题的有序解决：我们不太把欠陌生人的债当回事儿。	While governments and central banks race frantically to find a solution, there is a profound psychological dynamic at work that stands in the way of an orderly debt workout: our aversion to recognizing obligations to strangers.
如果意大利雄心勃勃的最低收入和加大公共投资计划得到落实的话，他们很快就会陷入与IMF的艰苦谈判之中。	If the Italians’ grandiose plans for a minimum income and more public investment are implemented, they might soon find themselves in difficult discussions with the Fund.
再进一步试想一下，它们的中央银行尽管不愿意继续采取非常规货币政策进一步扩大规模，但也不愿意妨碍当选政府的经济刺激措施，让它们难堪。	Suppose further that their central banks, while unwilling to extend themselves further in unconventional monetary policy, are also unwilling to stymie elected governments’ policies by offsetting their efforts to stimulate their economies.
当尼克松披上“狂人”伪装时，他其实是在某种程度上借鉴了赫鲁晓夫的实例，赫鲁晓夫既是我的祖父，也是尼克松在担任美国副总统期间的对手。	When Nixon adopted his own “mad” persona, he was in some ways drawing on the example of Nikita Khrushchev, my grandfather and Nixon’s adversary during his tenure as US vice president.
除非问题的根源 — — 储蓄短缺，并且面对特朗普不可避免地将扩大联邦预算赤字的局面，这一问题可能进一步恶化 — — 得到解决，否则美国经常项目和贸易赤字将进一步扩大。	Unless the source of the problem – a saving shortfall that is likely to worsen in the face of Trump’s inevitable widening of federal budget deficits –is addressed, America’s current-account and trade deficits will only widen.
委员会的成员也确实意识到伦敦失去全球金融中心地位对就业和产出来说损失很严重，所以他们还准备了第二套说辞。	The commission’s members do recognize that London’s loss of status as a global financial center would be costly in terms of jobs and output, so they developed a second line of argument.
其在建立联合国和世界银行等正式机构上所表现出来的灵光一现的创造力和支持让位给了对孱弱、非正式和临时性组织的偏好，比如各种“G-某”集团和“意愿联盟 ” 。	Its inspired creativity and support in building formal institutions like the United Nations and World Bank has given way to a predilection for weak, informal, and ad hoc groupings, such as the various G-somethings and “coalitions of the willing.”
今年在巴厘岛上举行的东盟首脑会议本已达成协议，采用双边协商来解决这一区域的领土纷争，无奈中国的霸道声明从一开始就决定了这个协议的悲剧命运。	At this year’s ASEAN summit in Bali, it was agreed that these territorial disputes be settled through bilateral negotiations.
以色列在约旦河西岸消灭哈马斯恐怖分子的行动也应该停止－或者至少在可能的情况下最大限度的减少这样的行动－并且允许巴勒斯坦当局用他们自己的方法来对付他们。	The killing by Israel of Hamas terrorists in the West Bank should also be stopped – or at least limited as much as possible – and the Palestinian Authority should be permitted to deal with them in their own way.
比如，环境污染的恶化威胁到生活水平，而收入和财富不平等已可以与美国相提并论，腐败在公私机构和部门中横行。	Worsening environmental pollution, for example, threatens living standards, while inequality of income and wealth now rivals that of the United States and corruption pervades public institutions and the private sector alike.
管理人员用这些指标评估他们聘用和给予资金支持的人的生产率，追踪他们所承担的研发项目的下游影响，丝毫不关注这些指标的局限性。	Administrators are using such measures to assess the productivity of those they hire and fund, and track the downstream impact of the research and development projects they underwrite, with little regard for the limitations of such indices.
果真如此的话，对于这一经验 — — 以及我们自身 — — 恐怕没有比弗雷德里希·尼采更好的指导了。 尼采是他所在的时代最有洞察力的思想家。	If so, there are few better guides to that experience – and our own – than Friedrich Nietzsche, one of the most perceptive thinkers of his time.
但如今这些土地开始解冻并释放出沼气，并因此而导致进一步暖化 — — 以及进一步解冻和更多沼气的释放。	But areas that used to be frozen are now thawing, releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming – and to further thawing, which releases more methane.
议案最终得以通过，恰恰是因为联署人达成一致，把存款保险同银行监管新规绑定在一起，搞出一个谁都有所需要的方案。	The final bill passed only when its sponsors agreed to combine deposit insurance with new banking regulation, creating a package with something for everyone.
这是一个坚实的开端，而且我们应当鼓励发展此类合同以便帮助数以十亿计的人们防范通货膨胀和通货紧缩风险。	This is a real beginning, and we should encourage such contracts to grow in order to help billions of people hedge their inflation and deflation risks.
在反恐怖主义方面，发生在孟买的悲剧事件凸显了推动情报共享、联合反应训练和人员交流以挫败我们这个时代最迫切威胁的真正机遇。	In terms of counterterrorism, the tragic events in Mumbai present an opportunity to ratchet up intelligence sharing, joint response training, and personnel exchanges to defeat the defining threat of our times.
然而，眼下正有传言，说 IMF 总裁多米尼克·施特劳斯 — 卡恩打算卸任，参加 2012 年法国总统大选，跟萨尔科齐一角高低。	Now, however, the rumor mill is heating up with gossip that the Fund’s managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, will leave in order to oppose Nikolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential elections.
通过采取综合性举措 — — 包括限制卖酒时间、回收公共空间和改善警察及司法系统 — — 2004年谋杀率下降到每100,000人21起谋杀。	By taking an integrated approach – limiting the hours during which alcohol can be sold, reclaiming public space, and improving the police and justice systems – the homicide rate was reduced to 21 per 100,000 in 2004.
正如阿拉伯之春所显示的那样，互联网能将本地事件迅速转化为全国性的爆点 — — 将新的互联性转化成引发政治不稳定和混乱的潜在源头。	As the Arab Spring demonstrated, the Internet can quickly transform local incidents into national flashpoints – turning the new connectivity into a potential source of political instability and turmoil.
其他小型经济体（主要是欧盟的新成员，它们有很大的经常账户赤字）面临着资本流入突然逆转的风险；这可能已经在拉脱维亚，爱沙尼亚，冰岛以及新西兰发生。	Other smaller economies (mostly the new members of the EU, which all have large current-account deficits) risk a sudden reversal of capital inflows; this may already be occurring in Latvia and Estonia, as well as in Iceland and New Zealand.
在一个有限的世界中，无限增长不可能实现，不断增长的产出也不会把食品送上所有人的餐桌，除非增长的好处被公平分配。	In a finite world, infinite growth is impossible, and rising output will not put food on everyone’s table if the benefits of growth are not fairly distributed.
在全球化世界中，很多人同属于想象中的共同体 — — 包括地方、区域、国家���世界 — — 上述共同体多以互联网和低成本旅行作为支撑。	In a world of globalization, many people belong to a number of imagined communities – local, regional, national, cosmopolitan – that are overlapping circles sustained by the Internet and inexpensive travel.
这就要求挑选合适人选负责相关事务，挑��像半个世纪多以前参与实施马歇尔计划，后来又负责联合国开发项目的美国实业家保罗·霍夫曼那样的人。	Doing so requires putting the right person in charge — someone like Paul Hoffman, the American industrialist who managed the Marshall Plan more than half a century ago and, subsequently, headed the UN Development Program.
保护森林的支付开始在联合国REDD+计划的支持下流动起来，绿色气候基金（Green Climate Fund）也将为森林保护提供5亿美元。 但可持续土地使用方面的总公共投资仍然不足。	While payments to conserve forests are starting to flow under the UN’s REDD+ program, and the Green Climate Fund has committed $500 million for forest protection payments, total public investment in sustainable land use remains inadequate.
像苹果、亚马逊和星巴克这样的大型跨国公司已经为避税重组了公司结构，以至于它们现在面临像欧盟等政体的制裁。	Major multinationals like Apple, Amazon, and Starbucks have structured their businesses to minimize taxes to such an extent that they are now facing sanctions from the likes of the European Union.
随着独生一代老龄化 — — 每年将增加大约1,000万退休者 — — 这一比例将会猛增，支持中国经济奇迹的劳动力剩余将变成遏制增长的严重短缺。	As the one-child generation ages – adding some ten million retirees annually – this ratio will skyrocket, with the labor surplus that supported China’s economic miracle giving way to a severe shortage that depresses growth.
此外，出口的增加以及用国产商品和服务替代进口品的也将提振经济，从而与税收的增加和转移支付的减少一道减少财政赤字。	Moreover, the increase in exports and the shift from imports to domestically produced goods and services would strengthen their economies, thereby reducing their fiscal deficits as tax revenues rose and transfers declined.
事实上，默克尔别无选择，只能让步并同意欧盟新财政契约的深刻变化 — — 放松对危机国家及其银行的再融资。	Indeed, she had no choice but to concede and agree to far-reaching changes to the EU’s new fiscal compact that will ease refinancing of the crisis countries and their banks.
即便如此，为响应习近平关于做大做强现有国企的号召，意见起草者提出更多措施以最小化拙劣公司治理带来的风险是很有意义的。	Even so, to be responsive to Xi’s call to strengthen and expand existing SOEs, it makes sense for the guidelines’ drafters to propose more measures to minimize risks stemming from poor corporate governance.
维也纳 — — 当前，在全球金融危机的背景下，我们面临的最大的挑战在于，我们无法控制它的复杂性和多样性。	VIENNA – The greatest challenge of the current global financial crisis is the seeming impossibility of comprehending and managing its diversity.
2010到2025年近半数的全球GDP增长将来自440个新兴市场城市，其中不少西方高管甚至可能都从未听说。	Nearly half of global GDP growth from 2010 to 2025 will come from 440 emerging-market cities, many of which Western executives may not even know exist.
与此同时，哈马斯认为阿巴斯争取联合国承认的努力是为了给内塔尼亚胡施压，从而重启基于1967年边境线的和平谈判。 哈马斯是不承认1967年边境线的。	At the same time, Hamas suspects that Abbas’s effort to gain UN recognition is intended to impose pressure on Netanyahu to revive peace negotiations on the basis of the 1967 borders, a position that Hamas rejects.
城市化进程不可避免：拥有12亿人的经济体不可能让三分之二的人留在农村还期望增长；农村居民将不可避免地转移到城市寻找工作和更好的生活。	Urbanization is inevitable: an economy of 1.2 billion people cannot employ two-thirds of them in agriculture and hope to grow; rural people will inevitably move to cities to seek work and better lives.
而他们道德负担的日渐减少是基于一种认可：是他们正确预测了马杜罗政府决定就算饿死人民也不会重组您所持有的债券。	The less morally burdened among them bask in the recognition they receive for having been right to predict that Maduro’s government would decide to starve its people rather than restructure the bonds you hold.
有了作为“希望回归”化身的全新总统，美国人信心满满，重新燃起了希望。 他们开始认为，经济最坏的时刻已经过去。	Comforted by a new President who incarnates a return of hope, who inspires and reassures at the same time, Americans are starting to believe that the worst of the economic crisis is behind them.
新签定的协议把乌克兰的能源需求交给一个与国际犯罪联系密切的影子公司全盘掌控，这样就为新的、也许是更加凶险的危机埋下了伏笔。	By placing Ukraine’s energy needs in the hands of a shadowy company linked to international criminals, the agreement has planted the seeds of new and perhaps more dangerous crises.
在这本书中，我们探讨了评估小组推荐的十大干预举措 — — 我将这些举措称之为“十诫 ” — —同时还考量了迄今为止所取得的进展，以及仍需完成哪些工作。	In it, we discuss the Review’s ten recommended interventions – what I call the Ten Commandments – while considering the progress made so far, and the work that still needs to be done.
首先 ， “ 核威胁或使用核武器总体而言违反适用于武装冲突的国际法规则，特别是人道主义法律规则的原则 。 ”	First, “the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law.”
但当然，潜台词是如果这种对地产的病态痴迷导致了一种爱情的实用主义，那么它同时也可能引发一场令许多经济学忧虑不已，担心会迅速爆破的地产泡沫。	But, of course, the sub-text is that if this fixation on property has also led to greater pragmatism in affairs of the heart, it has also led to a worrisome property bubble that many economists now fear could soon burst.
而对常任理事国否决权的其中一个限制 — — 关于争端当事国不得投票的要求 — — 则强调了在安理会做出决定时保持某种中立态度的重要性。	The one limit on the permanent members’ veto power – the requirement that a party to a dispute must abstain from voting – underscores the importance of maintaining some semblance of neutrality when making decisions in the Security Council.
— — 政府不愿意公开说明彻底解决问题所需要投入的真正金额，现在给予银行的救助还不够，只能说是救急，而不能使得经济真正得以好转。	- Governments do not like to admit the full costs of the problem, so they give the banking system just enough to survive, but not enough to return it to health.
但现在，他们必须选择是要在极左和极右翼遭到欧洲怀疑论政党的包抄，亦或是成立超国家民主制度来应对上述威胁，并解除选民的合理忧虑。	Now, though, they must choose between being outflanked by Euroskeptic parties on both the far left and far right, or responding to that threat by creating a supra-national democracy that can satisfy voters’ legitimate concerns.
非洲城市所受到的影响最为突出，白米、冷冻鸡肉、面包、黄油、鸡蛋甚至碳酸饮料的价格要比世界其他城市至少高出24 % 。	The impact is most pronounced in African cities, where prices for white rice, frozen chicken, bread, butter, eggs, and even carbonated soft drinks are at least 24% higher than in other cities around the world.
用不了多久，复杂性问题便能够解决，而全球供应链的线性模式（在A国生产，在B国被消费）便让位给了包括更碎片化但也更高效的供给网络的更复杂的模式。	With only a slight lag, complexity became manageable, and global supply chains’ linear model (something produced in country A is consumed in country B) gave way to a more complex model with more fragmented but more efficient supply networks.
李克强仅容忍经济在一定程度上放缓是因为GDP增长低于8%不仅无助于完成结构改革，还有可能导致社会动荡并损害中国经济。	The view that Li will tolerate slower growth only above a particular threshold is based on the belief that GDP growth below 8% would hurt economic development more than it helped, and lead to social instability.
一个由激进左翼联盟带领的政府必须适当柔化缓和其方法和承诺，它将继续坚持改革和限制支出以换取大量减少其债务负担 — — 这也是三驾马车所愿意接受的。	A Syriza-led government must moderate its approach and promise that it will continue to pursue reform and limit spending in exchange for a substantial reduction to its debt burden – a reduction that the troika must be willing to grant.
一些发达经济特的金融制度 — — 如澳大利亚、加拿大和新加坡 — — 显示出了卓著的韧性，但其他则陷入了麻烦。	Some financial systems in developed economies – for example, in Australia, Canada, and Singapore – have shown remarkable resilience, while others have gotten into trouble.
事实上，只有当你认为该时期政策是合理的，或者更切题一些，类似的政策在未来也是合理的，泰勒规则才是是合理政策指南。	Indeed, a Taylor rule is a guide for desirable policy only if one thinks that the policies followed in that period were desirable, or, more to the point, that similar policies will be desirable in the future.
这也是一个明确的标志，说明美国的收入失衡状况已经上升到了不仅威胁经济发展，同时也威胁到了民主体制健康运行的程度。	This is a clear sign that income inequality in the US has risen to levels that threaten not only the economy’s growth, but also the health of its democracy.
自1960年代起，在北爱尔兰，法国的科西嘉岛，意大利的南蒂罗尔以及西班牙的巴斯克等地区，炸弹与死亡已经成了当地的家常便饭。	From the 1960’s onwards, bombs and death were the order of the day in regions like Northern Ireland, Corsica (France), South Tyrol (Italy), and the Basque country (Spain).
但是，依托新造的南海据点，中国不但能够更好地保持地区内的空域和海域巡逻，还能推进器在印度洋和西太平洋展示实力的战略。	But, from its newly built perches in the South China Sea, China is better positioned not only to sustain air and sea patrols in the region, but also to advance its strategy of projecting power across the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific.
然而，他解释说 ： “ 当时，我们认为如果能够突出这部分内容，那么它将会对政策制定者和政治家产生影响，从而鼓励他们采取一些具体的行动 。 ”	Nonetheless, he explained, “we thought that if we can highlight it, it will impact policy-makers and politicians and encourage them to take some concrete action.”
事实上，在1990年华沙的一次会议是上，波兰总统、共产党总书记雅鲁泽尔斯基将军（General Wojciech Jaruzelski）对我和我的内阁同僚宣布“历史的力量不可避免地将我们引向资本主义 。 ”	Indeed, at a meeting in Warsaw in the winter of 1990, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland’s President and communist party boss, declared to me and my cabinet colleagues that “The forces of history have inevitably led us to capitalism.”
在各行各业中都可以找到零和活动；一个制造企业可以聘请帮忙减少应缴税费的税务会计师以及专注于金融工程的高级管理人员。	And zero-sum activities can be found in all sectors; manufacturing companies can employ tax accountants to minimize liabilities and top executives who focus on financial engineering.
中国还有人说美国抓住食品和产品安全问题是限制中国进口以及减少双边贸易赤字战略的一部分。 这一说法实际上没有根据。	There are also those in China who argue that the US focus on food and product safety is part of a strategy to restrict Chinese imports and reduce the bilateral trade deficit. This argument has no basis in fact.
否则 — — 放任印度法律继续成为束缚某些印度人民的牢笼 — — 将直接破坏构成印度民主基石的身份和言论自由。	The alternative – allowing Indian law to continue to serve as an iron cage for some of our people – would directly undermine the freedom of identity and expression that constitutes the backbone of Indian democracy.
其一是政治上的，与主权有关：欧洲的全面团结只能通过更强大的财政和货币联邦主义来实现，这能令欧元区在存在少数反对声音的情况下可以有所行动。	The first is political and involves sovereignty: Full European solidarity can be achieved only through stronger fiscal and monetary federalism, which would enable the eurozone to act, despite minority dissent.
当罗伯特·舒曼和康拉德·阿登纳创立欧洲煤钢共同体的时候，决定性的法国领导开始实现欧洲统一的第一个历史时刻来临了。	The first moment when decisive French leadership began to unify Europe came when Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer created the European Coal and Steel Community.
虽然巴基斯坦军队花了很长一段时间才平定了当地不断爆发的暴力和骚乱活动，但巴军在南瓦齐里斯坦地区的行动也确实取得了成效。	It took a while for the Pakistani Army to move against the region’s rising violence and chaos, but its campaign in South Waziristan is making progress.
当古列尔莫·马可尼（Guglielmo Marconi）在一个世纪之前实现首次跨大西洋无线电传输时，还只是想在点对点传输方面和电报竞争；却从未预见大众广播收音机会因此诞生。	When Guglielmo Marconi made the first transatlantic wireless transmission over a century ago, he was competing with the telegraph in point-to-point communication; he never envisioned popular mass-broadcast radio.
当联合政府在三年前上台执政之时，英国的赤字总量估计将超过任何一个G20集团成员国，相当于本国GDP的11%强。	When the coalition government came to office three years ago, the United Kingdom’s deficit was forecast to be higher than that of any other country in the G-20, at more than 11% of GDP.
对于叙利亚的毁灭，世界束手旁观甚至参与其中，结果，超过 500,000人失去了生命，大部分叙利亚人被迫离开家园。	The world has done little but watch or, worse, participate in the destruction of Syria, where more than 500,000 people have lost their lives and a majority of the population has been forced to leave their homes.
健康寿命预期的增加是一个积极的发展趋势，但这一人口变化为许多已经开始失去自生能力的经济体造成了严重的威胁。	While the rise in healthy life expectancy is a positive development, this demographic shift poses a serious threat to many economies, which are already losing vitality.
事实上，尽管陆克文的澳大利亚总理生涯一点都不平坦，但他的过人智力是我在过去30年里打过交道的所有公共人物中首屈一指的。	Indeed, though Rudd’s tenure as Australia’s prime minister was anything but smooth, his sheer force of intellect is unmatched by that of any public figure with whom I have interacted over the last 30 years.
事实上，人们在国家间的迁徙早已有数千年历史了 — — 有人为了避祸，有人为了发财，有人向往自由，有人则为寻找一个新的开始。	People have migrated to other countries for thousands of years – to escape, prosper, be free, or just to start again.
格兰岱尔，加利福尼亚—作为最恪守传统的宗教之一，天主教的核心中包含着一个悖论。 这个悖论正在变得日益尖锐。	GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA – Catholicism, among the most tradition-bound religions, contains at its core a paradox that has become increasingly sharp.
通过改良种子储备和更有效的水管理，我们可以获得水需求更低的作物，以更高密度种植，并且能适应更大的温度范围。	Through improved seed stocks and more efficient water management, we can have crops that require less water, grow at higher density, and thrive in wider temperature ranges.
如果成功，或许他们应该在荣耀的绿色伊斯兰国旗周围添加一个黑色的边框 — — 不是表示哀悼的黑色，而是代表正义的黑色。	If they succeed, perhaps they should add a black border around the proud Islamic green of their flag – the black not of mourning, but of justice.
他们也许缺少迈克尔·道格拉斯（Michael Douglass）在1987年的电影《华尔街 》 （ Wall Street）中所扮演的角色直白，但他们所传递的信息是一样的 ： “ 贪婪是一件好事 。 ”	They may lack the candor of Michael Douglas’s character in the 1987 movie Wall Street, but the message hasn’t changed: “Greed is good.”
巴勒斯坦人抱怨说国际社会之所以办事不公，就是因为它们不满在巴勒斯坦领土上举行的自由和公正的选举结果。 哈马斯在这一选举中大获全胜。	Palestinians complained that the international community acted unjustly, simply because they were unhappy with the result of a free and fair election in the Palestinian territories, which Hamas won overwhelmingly.
此外，如果我们向紧急状态那样对待气候变化，在未来20年中认真地减缓变暖的速度，则牧业的影响比例会更大。	Moreover, if we treated climate change as the emergency it is and were serious about slowing the pace of warming over the next 20 years, the proportional influence of livestock farming would be even greater.
在1996-2005期间，人民币盯住美元的制度促进了通过坚定不移的改革和严格的财政纪律来实现最强劲的经济增长。	China achieved its strongest growth when the renminbi was pegged to the dollar – a system that required steadfast reforms and strict fiscal discipline.
同情等道���情感和直立行走和可弯折的大拇指一样，都是适应的不择向的作用，是物种通过特定基因的繁衍而获得的特征。	Moral emotions like empathy are as much an outcome of the blind workings of adaptation as our upright stance and opposable thumbs – traits that are entrenched in a species through the proliferation of particular genes.
民主党总统提名人希拉里·克林顿的政策平台提出了解决这些问题的新计划，并特别强调探亲假和早教和大学教育。	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s policy platform proposes new programs to address these issues, with a particular focus on family leave and early childhood and college education.
“退欧”支持者将退欧比做20世纪40年代的敦刻尔克精神 — — 一个民族独自岿然屹立、抵挡住入侵的舰队和武装，同时始终完全独立于欧洲。	The rhetoric of the “Leave” supporters conjures up the spirit of Dunkirk in 1940 – a nation standing alone, impervious to invading armadas and armies, and always fiercely independent of Europe.
换句话说，欧洲人的实践行为反映出美元作为唯一真正全球货币、被中国和全世界货币交易这和投资者无条件接受的“过度特权 ” 。	In other words, European practice reflects the dollar’s “exorbitant privilege” as the only true global currency, freely accepted by currency traders and investors in China and around the world.
而政府必须重新进行资源分配，这些资源以前被拨给了精神病院和在保持现状中拥有既得利益的官僚机构，而现在却应该拨给那些致力于社区生活的机构和组织。	And governments must reallocate resources from institutions -- and the bureaucracies that have a vested interest in preserving their positions -- to organizations that support community-based living.
大量有资格领取社会保障福利的美国老年人将在未来30年使得社会保障计划支出相对GDP的比例从当前的4.9％上升至6.3 ％ 。	The larger number of older Americans who are eligible for Social Security benefits will drive the program’s costs from 4.9% of GDP this year to 6.3% of GDP over the next 30 years.
Pourtant, aujourd’hui, les universités des États-Unis sont bien meilleures que leurs homologues européennes.	Yet today, universities in the United States easily outperform their European counterparts.
麦肯锡公司指出，到2030年，数字化有望改变四个关键行业（消费和零售、汽车和交通、医疗、及物流）并创造相当于全行业10 % - 45%的收入。	As McKinsey notes, digitization promises to shift and create value equivalent to anywhere from 10% to 45% of total industry revenues in four key sectors (consumer and retail, automotive and mobility, health care, and freight and logistics) by 2030.
与人们所设想的相反，他并没有一幅关于全世界的战略图景，这一短板可以从他一碰到反对的声音便迅速妥协一窥端倪。	Contrary to what one might think, he does not have a real strategic vision of the world – a shortcoming reflected in his quick capitulation in the face of opposition to his proposals.
由于那些赌价格会上涨并且买入的人和那些预测价格会下跌但是因为卖空代价太大而仍然坚持的人之间的不对称，泡沫进一步被吹大。	The bubble is inflated further by the asymmetry between those who bet that prices will rise and buy, and those who forecast a fall, but stay out because to sell short is too costly.
但是，资本存量相对于产出不断增加意味着不断降低的资本回报，假以时日，这将给银行部门带来更多的不良贷款。	An ever-increasing capital stock relative to output, however, means ever-lower returns to capital and thus ever more non-performing loans in the banking sector over time.
许多网站和论坛都发动类似“如果你是郭海藻，你会选择宋思明和一套房子，还是选择小贝（那个被抛弃的前男友）和真爱 ？ ”	Many Web sites and bulletin boards have run surveys with questions like, “If you were Guo Haizao, would you choose Song Siming and an apartment or Xiaobei (the dumped boyfriend) and true love?”
即使在德国选举之后，我仍不确定德国政府愿意支持意大利援助计划而不要求获得关于意大利执政联盟目标 — — 甚至其组成 — — 的重大承诺。	Even after Germany’s election, I am not sure that the government will be willing to support an Italian rescue program without asking for major guarantees concerning the objectives – and even the composition – of Italy’s ruling coalition.
而在近700所由联合国负责管理的叙利亚、加沙、西岸、黎巴嫩和约旦的学校中，近年来近半数都曾有过至少一次遇袭或关闭的经历。	And nearly half of the 700 UN-administered schools in Syria, Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Jordan have been attacked or shut down at least once in recent years.
这些目标伟大、高尚、雄心勃勃，但同时完全符合今天二百年智利的现实状况，今天的智利正以前所未有的乐观和热情准备迎接21世纪。	They are grand, noble, and ambitious goals, but fully attainable for today’s Chile, the Bicentennial Chile, a Chile now viewing the twenty-first century with more optimism and enthusiasm than ever before.
在欧洲，欧洲研究委员会(ERC)的创立正进入决定性阶段。 这对于我们准备让科学好奇心发挥怎样的作用具有至关重要的意义。	In Europe, the establishment of the European Research Council (ERC) is entering a decisive phase, with crucial implications concerning the role we are prepared to concede to scientific curiosity.
1971年8月15日，尼克松向进口货物加征10%的临时附加税，以“确保美国产品不会因不公平汇率而陷于劣势 。 ”	On August 15, 1971, Nixon imposed a temporary surcharge of 10% on imports “to ensure that American products will not be at a disadvantage because of unfair exchange rates.”
但这些目标 — — 包括改善农业，制造业和服务业的市场准入机制；厘清国际贸易规则；并在解决环境问题上取得进展 — — 有点过于雄心勃勃了。	But these objectives – including improvement of market access in agriculture, manufacturing, and services; clarification of international trade rules; and progress on addressing relevant environmental issues – were overly ambitious.
在以色列人看来，从今往后一旦涉及核武器这个议题，美国将对各国一视同仁；以方还尤为关切奥巴马可能乐于将以色列的核地位与伊朗的核野心相提并论，以此处理伊朗核问题一事。	From now on, it appeared to Israelis, the US will treat all states the same when it comes to nuclear weapons. Israel is especially concerned that Obama might be willing to address Iran’s nuclear ambition by equating it with Israel’s nuclear status.
对于共产主义的强硬派来说，他是三重英雄 — — 无论从历史学角度上，从爱国主义角度，还是从全世界的角度来说。	For hard-line Communists, he was a hero three times over – historical, patriotic, and world-class.
事实上，整个地区都弥漫着日益加深的疑虑：当外国军队离开后，阿富汗将再次陷入内战，塔利班将最终重新掌权。	Indeed, across the region, apprehension is growing that when foreign troops leave, Afghanistan will again descend into civil war, ultimately bringing the Taliban back to power.
奥巴马将在求助国会时谨言慎行，因为即使他的共和党对手投票给予有限的支持，他们也会想尽一切办法让他们的日子不好过。	Obama will tread carefully as he approaches Congress and, even as his Republican opponents vote to offer limited support, they will make his life as difficult as possible.
在美国，总统奥巴马要求国会拨款62亿美元，其中24亿美元用于降低埃博拉进入美国的风险和建立50座美国埃博拉治疗中心。	In the United States, President Barack Obama asked Congress for $6.2 billion, including $2.4 billion to reduce the risk of the disease becoming established in America and set up 50 US Ebola treatment centers.
由此导致的市场扭曲是世界渔业长期管理失调的主要因素，据世界银行估计，渔业管理失调2012年给全球经济造成83亿美元的损失。	The resulting market distortion is a major factor behind the chronic mismanagement of the world’s fisheries, which the World Bank calculates to have cost the global economy $83 billion in 2012.
特朗普已经清楚地表明，他将立刻让美国退出跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） — —这与罗斯对美国贸易协议的批评态度一致。	Trump has made it clear that he will immediately withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) – in keeping with Ross’s criticism of America’s trade deals.
他们认为响应刺激要求只能导致更多的刺激要求，形成一个彼此强化的分肥动态，一切财政整合观点都会被排除在外。	They believe that responding to calls for stimulus would simply lead to more such calls, creating a log-rolling, pork-barrel dynamic in which any hope for fiscal consolidation is ruled out.
美国为其同盟国提供的安全保障具备了可信度是因为核导弹正如约翰F·肯尼迪所期望的那样，并没有在十年之内扩展到25个国家。	The credibility of American security guarantees for its allies is one of the reasons that the bomb did not spread to 25 countries within a decade, as President John F. Kennedy once expected.
法国总统竞选中的领先竞争者Nicolas Sarkozy最近猛烈抨击被他称作“投机资本主义”的现象，并说他想要将欧元所创造的金融区“道德化 ” 。	Nicolas Sarkozy, the leading contender in the French presidential election, recently lashed out against what he called “speculative capitalism,” and says he wants to “moralize the financial zone” created by the euro.
如果从北约画出到这些国家和组织的辐射线，就可以形成拥有多个核心和集群的全球安全网络 — — 类似于一张互联网地图，或者是一张行星星系图。	If one draws links radiating outward from NATO to all of these different countries and organizations, the result is a security network that has multiple hubs and clusters – much like a map of the Internet or of planets and galaxies.
不幸的是，经济学家和其他社会科学家实际上没有受过如何在不同模型中做出选择的训练，也没有同行会赞赏他们在这方面的能力。	Unfortunately, economists and other social scientists get virtually no training in how to choose among alternative models. Neither is such an aptitude professionally rewarded.
中共害怕军阀 — — 这是1911年清朝覆灭后中国陷入分裂的关键原因 — — 如此偏向沈阳令人奇怪。	Given the CCP’s fear of warlordism – which played a key role in China’s dismemberment after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 – this imbalance in favor of Shenyang is odd.
勃兰登堡AfD领导人安德烈斯·卡尔比茨（Andreas Kalbitz）最近宣布该党计划在明年进行的三个东德州的选举中以“社会正义”为重点。	And the AfD leader in Brandenburg, Andreas Kalbitz, recently announced that the party plans to focus on “social justice” in upcoming elections in three eastern German states next year.
李家对三星电子的直接所有权只有不到5 % ， 但控制着集团实际控股公司三星物产 — — 持有三星电子4.3%的股权和三星寿险19.3%的股权 — — 31.1%的股权。	The Lee family has less than 5% direct ownership of Samsung Electronics, but holds a 31.1% stake in Samsung C&T, the group’s de facto holding company, which owns a 4.3% stake in Samsung Electronics and a 19.3% stake in Samsung Life Insurance.
但条约必须在附件中所列44个核技术持有国签署通过后才能生效，否则的话核试验的幽灵将依然萦绕在我们身边。	But, for the CTBT to enter into force, all 44 states specified as holders of nuclear technology must ratify it. Until they do, the specter of nuclear testing will continue to haunt us.
毕竟，美国颠覆过，或者至少试图颠覆过它所反对的无核政权，包括阿富汗、伊拉克、利比亚和（未获成功的）叙利亚。	The US has, after all, overthrown or at least tried to overthrow non-nuclear regimes that it opposes, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and (unsuccessfully) Syria.
周末，一份联邦调查局前局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey，特朗普炒他的鱿鱼导致了穆勒的任命）的备忘录被泄露，也引起了特朗普的愤怒。	At week’s end, a memoir by former FBI director James Comey, whose firing by Trump led to Mueller’s appointment, began to leak, also arousing Trump’s ire.
东京—10月5日，在经历了多年令人心疲力竭、事无巨细的讨价还价后，12个环太平洋国家终于签署了跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） 。 TPP协定包括了从更多贸易到更清洁的环境的一系列承诺。	TOKYO – On October 5, after years of exhausting – and exhaustive – haggling, a dozen Pacific Rim countries finally signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement that promises everything from more trade to a cleaner environment.
因特网上“开放代码”运动的发展表明：不仅是最基本的创意，就连具有巨大商业价值的产品都可以不受知识产权的保护而免费获得。	The growth of the “open source” movement on the Internet shows that not just the most basic ideas, but even products of enormous immediate commercial value can be produced without intellectual property protection.
而这正是人民银行在8月12—13日所做的，当时，比预期更大幅度的贬值压力和飙升的贬值预期导致了一个风险，即计划中的一次性汇率调整可能引发崩盘。	And this is precisely what the PBOC did on August 12-13, when stronger-than-expected depreciation pressure and surging devaluation expectations raised the risk that the planned one-off exchange-rate adjustment could trigger a rout.
基本要点在于，以两种标准算 — — 人均收入（以PPP汇率衡量）和总GDP（以市场汇率衡量 ） — —中国超越美国的时刻都在未来。	The bottom line is that, by either criterion – per capita income (at PPP exchange rates) or aggregate GDP (at market rates) – the day when China surpasses the US remains in the future.
不出意外，新自由主义者向来都绝口不提自由化的这一后果，因为他们声称 — — 或者说是撒谎 — — 所有人都会受益。	Not surprisingly, the neoliberals never advertised this consequence of trade liberalization, as they claimed – one could say lied – that all would benefit.
另外，他们还容易被犯罪团伙挟持，经过训练从事偷盗，或者在更坏的情况下任由恐怖分子摆布，执行袭击任务。	Moreover, they are prone to being kidnapped by criminal gangs, trained to steal or pickpocket, or, worse, placed at the mercy of terrorists for use in attacks.
让我们想想这个世界有多少核武器：全世界共有约16,300件，其中1,800件处于高度戒备状态，一声令下就可以发射。	Consider how many nuclear weapons there are: an estimated 16,300 around the world, with 1,800 on high alert and ready for use on short notice.
朝鲜经济现在更加开放，外贸几乎占到GDP的一半，这是金在20世纪90年代中期逐渐推进市场化进程的结果。	It is now more open, with foreign trade accounting for almost half of GDP, the result of a gradual marketization process that began in the mid-1990s.
最后一家公司是Rezz.it，主要从事规模较大而且计划好了的交易 — — 但同样关注于那些一旦有意出售的卖方无法找到有购买欲的买方，就不可能发生的交易。	Finally, there is Rezz.it, focused on larger, planned transactions – but, again, transactions that might not have happened because willing sellers would never have found eager buyers.
由麻省理工学院、德国国际和安全事务研究所（German Institute for International and Security Affairs）和其他领衔研究机构的研究者组成的小组已经制定了一些具体方案来实施这一计划。	A group of researchers representing MIT, the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, and other leading institutions, has already developed a set of concrete proposals regarding how to implement such a program.
中国国家主席习近平将这些人造岛列为其主要成就之一“我只能告诉你 ， ” 联合参谋部主管、陆军中将肯尼斯·麦肯齐（Kenneth McKenzie）最近说 ， “ 美军拥有丰富的摧毁西太平洋小岛的经验 。 ”	“I would just tell you,” joint staff director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie recently said, “the US military has had a lot of experience in the western Pacific taking down small islands.”
因此，很多全球最困难问题的解决，至少是部分解决实际就有赖于新的技术，这些技术可以让许多原有的复杂问题迎刃而解。	Thus, when we seek solutions to some of the world’s toughest problems, they, too, are likely to be found, at least in part, in new technologies that can resolve old and seemingly intractable problems.
新的金融交易税可能依然会面对来自欧洲内部（尤其是银行部门规模和影响力都相当庞大的英国）的政治阻力，但至少制定体现更高税负公平的规则已经排到了欧洲议程的前列。	The new FTT might still face political opposition in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, with its large and influential banking sector, but at least the principle of greater tax fairness is high on the European agenda.
论文作者指出尽管工业革命导致气候变化，但因为我们的祖先停止砍伐树木，煤炭应用实际对森林起到了保护作用。	Its authors point out that while the Industrial Revolution caused climate change, reliance on coal was actually good for forests, because our forebears stopped raiding forests for wood.
欧洲不愿实行再通胀政策是因为德国根深蒂固的对通胀的恐惧（这也是德国人始终致力于财政紧缩的原因 ） 。	Europe’s unwillingness to reflate reflects Germany’s deep-seated fear of inflation (which underpins its enduring commitment to austerity).
不仅如此，我们还不清楚中国预备怎样把医疗护理送到农村的艾滋病前沿，因为人民公社解体后，老的卫生防疫站体系早就随着农业集体化的崩溃不复存在了。	Moreover, it is unclear how care will be delivered to the rural front lines, where the old system of clinics based in Peoples’ Communes collapsed with the de-collectivization of agriculture.
北向喜马拉雅山南脉，东临茂密的柚木林，西南两侧则分别是孟加拉和印度洋，缅甸的历史和政治一直都被该国的地理位置所左右。	Ringed in the north by the southern ridges of the Himalayas, to the east by foothills of dense teak forests, and to the west and south by the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean, Burma’s geography has always shaped the country’s history and politics.
当然，这在很大程度上归功于中国，中国是十年来满足我增长预期的唯一一个金砖国家（巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国 ） （ 尽管印度相差也不是太多 ） 。	Of course, this is largely owing to China, the only BRIC country (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) that has met my growth expectations for the decade (although India is not too far behind).
但是，尽管出现了这些错误举措，但当全世界政府考虑如何最好地响应危机的教训时，曾经被视为问题的一部分的央行被认为是解决办法的关键部分。	Yet, despite these missteps, when governments around the world considered how best to respond to the lessons of the crisis, central banks, once seen as part of the problem, came to be viewed as an essential part of the solution.
米歇尔在这方面已经耗费了整整一年，并与其他因素一起导致了以色利的内塔尼亚胡政府和奥巴马当局之间的紧张关系。	More than a year was wasted on this, causing, among other things, tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and the Obama administration.
但直到进口开始压垮越来越多的美国工业部门并刺激产生了巨额且持续的对外贸易逆差之后，该国的贸易政策才开始变得更加富有防御性，进而与许多合作伙伴产生摩擦。	It was not until imports began to overwhelm a growing number of industries in the US, fueling the emergence of large and persistent external deficits, that the country’s trade policy became more defensive, creating friction with many of its partners.
即使中国领导人认为他们拥有必要的财政空间事实这一战略，他们也有可能因为通胀风险而不这么做。 通胀风险比其他任何经济变量更有可能导致社会动荡。	Even if China’s leaders decided that they had the necessary fiscal latitude to pursue such a strategy, they probably would not, owing to the risk of inflation, which, perhaps more than any other economic variable, tends to lead to social unrest.
最近的欧洲政坛乱象表明，不管从抽象角度看德国总理默克尔为重债外围国开出的紧缩药方是多么明智，其外表却总像是德国在颐指气使。	The current political turmoil in Europe shows that, regardless of how sensible Chancellor Angela Merkel’s austerity prescriptions for debt-ridden peripheral Europe might be in the abstract, they resemble a German Diktat.
随着借贷门槛降低，增加消费的并非富人群体，他们的支出本不受收入制约；增加消费的主要是贫穷和年轻的家庭，他们的梦想超出了他们的收入。	When borrowing becomes easier, it is not the well-to-do, whose spending is not constrained by their incomes, who increase their consumption; rather, the increase comes from poorer and younger families whose needs and dreams far outpace their incomes.
有时，两种同源体的序列一致性程度可以低至只有25—30 % ， 与此同时，它们的折叠却仍保持着极大的相似性，这证明蛋白质功能对进化是鲁棒的。	Sometimes the extent of sequence identity between two orthologs can be as low as 25-30%, and yet their folds remain strikingly similar, attesting to the robustness of function to evolutionary change.
值得赞扬的是，中国确实宣布了环境政策的重大变化 — — 一个全国性的温室气体排放限额交易系统，将于2017年生效。	To its credit, China did announce an important shift in environmental policy – a nationwide cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions, to go into effect in 2017.
但正如我们从汤玛斯·库恩（Thomas Kuhn）以及其他科学哲学家那里所认识到的那样，最主流的理论范式往往不一定是最准确的。	As we know from the work of Thomas Kuhn and other philosophers of science, dominant paradigms do not always turn out to be the most accurate.
因此尽管P5+1集团（中国、法国、俄罗斯、英国、美国，再加上德国）在哈萨克斯坦会议上已做出让步，谈判没有进展也并不出人意料。	So it was no surprise that itdid not, despite the concessions that were made at the meeting in Kazakhstan by the P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus Germany).
如果我们把行为建立在恐惧的基础上，我们就会带着狐疑的目光打量所有与我们不同的人，加深我们祖国内外数百万认为自己无法融入哪怕是最开放的社会的人的疏离感。	If our behavior is based on fear, we will look with suspicion on all those who are different from us, deepening the alienation of the millions inside and outside our countries who believe that they cannot integrate into even the most open societies.
预算没能通过的原因是极右翼的瑞典民主党（Swedish Democrats）突然决定支持中右翼联盟的方案。	Having failed to pass its first budget – owing to the abrupt decision by the far-right Swedish Democrats (SD) to support the Alliance alternative – the government could not simply continue as if nothing had happened.
但正如前总统卡姆莱马·莫特兰特（Kgalema Motlanthe）主持的高级别小组最近所主张的那样，还需要一系列配套措施来支持年轻人和其他弱势求职者的就业。	But, as the high-level panel chaired by former President Kgalema Motlanthe has recently argued, complementary measures are needed to support employment of young people and other vulnerable job seekers.
不久前他刚刚批准投入巨资兴建基础设施，其中包括一座臭名昭著的通往阿拉斯加偏远地区的大桥，作为对其政治支持者们的一项回报。	He recently signed a lavish infrastructure bill that included, among other payoffs to political supporters, an infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska.
4月，西班牙警方对前国际货币基金组织（IMF）总裁罗德里格·拉托（Rodrigo Rato）提起腐败调查质询。	In April, Spanish police questioned Rodrigo Rato, a former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, as part of a corruption probe.
我们还应该停止用手段混淆目的：比如，管理良好的自由贸易可能带来更大的共同繁荣；但如果得不到良好的管理，它就将降低许多 — — 也许是大部分 — — 公民的生活水平。	And we should stop confusing ends with means: for example, free trade, if well managed, might bring greater shared prosperity; but if it is not well managed, it will lower the living standards of many – possibly a majority – of citizens.
这项工程共动用了6533门高炮，5939个火箭发射架以及许多架次的飞机来播撒干冰，液态氮和碘化银，好让覆盖中国大陆1/3面积的云团洒下雨来。	Such efforts, Zheng reports, have involved some 6,533 cannons, 5,939 rocket launchers, and numerous aircraft in an attempt to seed clouds across one-third of China’s landmass with dry ice, ammonia, and silver iodide.
如果发展中国家戒烟人口的比例从当今的5%不到提高到2020年的40 % ( 正如加拿大目前的戒烟率 ) ， 那么，在2050年以前就可以避免大约一亿五千万到一亿八千万人死于吸烟。	About 150-180 million tobacco deaths would be avoided before 2050 if the proportion of adults in developing countries who quit smoking increases from below 5% today to 30-40% by 2020 (like current quit rates in Canada).
如此，特朗普就能在国内宣称取得胜利，同时让欧洲消费者摆脱欧盟农业保护主义的束缚，提高欧洲人民的生活水平。	This would enable Trump to proclaim victory at home, while raising the European standard of living by freeing Europe’s consumers from the yoke of the EU’s agricultural protectionism.
他用在线绘图工具绘制了他所居住的姆班达卡（Mbandaka）村的首张地图，他和他的妻子2009年来已经对这张图修改超过100,000次。	Using online mapmaking tools, he created the first map of his village, Mbandaka, which he and his wife have modified more than 100,000 times since 2009.
但如果它能设法解决其中最为紧迫的问题 — — 下行通货紧缩风险 — — 其备受争议的债务挑战就将变得更加易于管理。	But if it manages to address the most urgent among them – downside deflationary risks – its much-discussed debt challenge will become far more manageable.
我本人关于今天的停滞的理论关注人们对技术的迅速进步的焦虑。 技术的迅速进步可能最终取代大量乃至大部分工作岗位，造成巨大的经济不平等。	My own theory about today’s stagnation focuses on growing angst about rapid advances in technologies that could eventually replace many or most of our jobs, possibly fueling massive economic inequality.
但格里萨的裁决基于对阿根廷合同的某些条款的特殊解读 — — 在我们看来，这样的解读根本站不住脚 — — 这表明美国的商业利益可能左右法院判决。	But Griesa's ruling, based on a peculiar – and in our view, indefensible – interpretation of certain terms in Argentina's contract, showed that US commercial interests can dominate its courts' decisions.
所幸中国的家庭和国企创造了庞大的储蓄，才使中国经济得以承受权贵资本主义造成的资源巨大浪费和扭曲配置。	And, thanks to the large pool of savings generated by Chinese households and state-owned companies, the Chinese economy can for the time being bear the waste and misallocation implied by such crony capitalism.
反对派活动份子被阻止进行大部分的竞选活动，他们经常被捕，而克里姆林宫控制的法院不受理他们的抗议申请。	Opposition activists were blocked from most campaigning, and often arrested, while Kremlin-controlled courts denied their complaints.
尽管制裁能够提高制造核武器的成本，但历史表明，如果政府对于拥有核武器足够重视，就愿意承担高昂的代价。	Although sanctions may increase the cost of producing nuclear weapons, history suggests that governments are willing to pay a significant price if they place a high enough value on having them.
多年来，一直由美元充当着这一角色（从某种程度上说也包括某些其他国家的货币 ） ， 这引发了诸多关于美国拥有“过分特权”的抱怨。	For years, the pragmatic answer has been the dollar, and to some extent other national currencies, giving rise to complaints of an “inordinate privilege” for the US.
关键在于争论双方都更加明确他们认为社会应该追求怎样的价值观和目标，并对他们关于动态表现如何响应特定的激励的假设进行量化。	The key is for participants on both sides to be more explicit about the values and objectives they believe that society should pursue, and to quantify their assumptions about how dynamic performance will respond to particular incentives.
伊朗与英国和美国的冲突是一个含义更加广泛的局面的一部分，即19和20世纪期间西方利用其军事和经济主导力将其实力和政治意愿凌驾于世界大部之上。	Iran’s confrontation with the UK and the US is part of the much broader saga of the West’s use of its military and economic dominance to project its power and political will over much of the world during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
赫希曼指出当一条车道开始移动时，另一条车道上的人会“感觉好多了 ” ， 因为他们感觉自己很快也能向前开一点。	Hirschman argued that when one lane of cars begins moving, people in the other lane “feel much better off,” because they expect to move soon, too.
在政府强制基金经理参与拍卖之前，市场竞争几乎非常微弱（调查结果显示大多数人并不清楚支付了多少费用 ） 。	Until the government forced fund managers to participate in auctions, there was little market competition (surveys reveal that most people are not aware of the fees they pay).
（相反，他们在第二轮选举开始前就被一场军事政变所粉碎，由此引发八年的残酷内战导致约200,000人丧生。 ）	(Instead, they were crushed by a military coup, before a second round of elections could take place, triggering a brutal eight-year civil war in which an estimated 200,000 people died.)
今年8月，在怀俄明州杰克森霍尔（Jackson Hole）举行的央行高官年度会议上，他又投下了第二颗重磅炸弹。	This August, he used the annual gathering of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to drop another bomb.
但2008—2009年金融危机所造成的混乱，以及随后所采取的紧缩措施，破坏了作为欧盟立盟之基的承诺，也让有毒意识形态死灰复燃。	But the disarray produced by the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and the austerity measures that followed, undermined the EU’s foundational promises and paved the way for the return of toxic ideologies.
教育也越来越在线化了，很快，各地的学生就能以几乎为零的（增加学生人数的 ） “ 边际成本”获得一流的教学服务。	Education is increasingly online as well, and will soon enable students everywhere to receive first-rate instruction at almost a zero “marginal” cost for enrolling another student.
但是现在局势飘忽不定，自助还是不足。 现在需要各国政府和中央银行动手，因为只有它们才规模足够庞大，行动足够迅速。	But in a climate of profound uncertainty, self-help is not enough. Governments or central banks are needed, because only they are both big and quick enough.
如果全球经济继续沿着当前轨迹运行下去，那么一段时间的剧烈波动可能动摇许多新兴经济体，也破坏全球发展努力。	If the global economy remains on its current trajectory, a period of intense volatility could destabilize a number of emerging economies, while undermining development efforts worldwide.
事实上，以色列对特朗普的支持率在特朗普决定退出JCPOA、以色列对在叙利亚的伊朗目标进行大规模军事打击后达到了历史新高。	In fact, support for Trump in Israel reached a record high after his decision to withdraw from the JCPOA, and following Israel’s massive military strike against Iranian targets in Syria.
与此同时，希腊要保证这些改革不会伤害最贫困人群，这可以听过引入积极的劳动力市场政策实现（如培训补贴和雇用长期失业者 ） 。	At the same time, Greece would ensure that these reforms do not hurt the poorest by introducing active labor-market policies (such as subsidies to train and hire the long-term unemployed).
这在今天尤其重要，如果美国没有成为两国制的热情支持者，它就会落后于形势的发展，并损害其自身在中东的利益。	This has never been more true than today, and if America is not seen as an avid supporter of a two-state solution, it will stay well behind the curve and damage its own interests in the Middle East.
迄今为止，美国人都能在很大程度上容忍 — — 甚至称赞 — — 与商业创新相关的创造性破坏，并在限制潜在的滥用行为时保持谨慎。	So far, Americans have largely tolerated – and even applauded – the creative destruction associated with business innovation, and have been cautious in limiting potential abuses.
另外，烟草工业通过诡计，以巨额的资金支持发动长期的、处心积虑的假信息攻势，也在环境癌症风险方面混淆视听。	Moreover, confusion about environmental cancer risks also results from longstanding, carefully cultivated, and well-financed disinformation campaigns inspired by the machinations of the tobacco industry.
已故经济学家、欧洲央行行长夏欧帕（Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa）曾说，撒切尔“移走了分割市场和政府的界线，扩大了前者的地盘，缩小了后者的地盘 。 ”	As the late economist and European central banker Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa once put it, Thatcher “shifted the line dividing markets from government, enlarging the territory of the former at the expense of the latter.”
尽管如此 — — 或者，正因为他蔑视任何形式的多边主义 — — 美国总统特朗普称之为“有史以来最愚蠢的协议 ” ， 并预言它将“导致核毁灭 ” 。	Despite that – or, perhaps, because of his disregard for multilateralism in all forms – US President Donald Trump has called it the “stupidest deal of all time,” and predicted that it would “lead to a nuclear holocaust.”
平心而论，一些改革 — — 包括税收、监管和卫生方面的措施 — — 有助于在不给公共部门带来额外高成本的 同时重新实现平衡。	To be fair, some reforms – including tax, regulatory, and health-care measures – will help to restore balance without imposing large additional costs on the public sector.
比如，对西班牙而言，在建设共同欧洲能源市场方面，法国的合作至关重要；事实上，这一关系能够为法国和全欧洲带来巨大的好处。	For example, France’s cooperation on the construction of a common European market for energy is crucial for Spain; indeed, this relationship could be enormously beneficial both for France and all of Europe.
虽然有必要认识到设定通货目标的优点，但在评估我们自身经济状况以及政策的成败方面，痛苦指数也是有一定作用的。	While it is important to recognize the merits of inflation targeting, the misery index, too, has a role to play in helping us to assess the state of our economies – and the success of our policies.
纽约—我是宏观经济学家，但我不同意美国最主要的两个宏观经济学阵营：专注于提振总需求的新凯恩斯主义和专注于减税的供给学派。	NEW YORK – I am a macroeconomist, but I dissent from the profession’s two leading camps in the United States: the neo-Keynesians, who focus on boosting aggregate demand, and the supply-siders, who focus on cutting taxes.
近几周来，伊朗货币里亚尔贬值了约40 % ， 极大地增加了伊朗的通货膨胀率和伊朗的进口品和原材料价格。	Iran’s currency, the rial, has fallen roughly 40% in recent weeks, sharply increasing Iran’s inflation rate and what Iranians must pay for imports and many staples.
因此，难怪被视为中国人民银行行长潜在的继任者—周小川(他本人同时也是很有影响力的银行家)曾提出警告：有可能会出现中国式的次贷危机。	No wonder, then, that one influential banker regarded as a possible successor to PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has warned of the possibility of a “Chinese-style subprime crisis.”
因此，在对妇女的作用持现代看法的富裕发达社会中，生育率总是会低于替代率也是是不可避免的，总体而言也是值得欢迎的。	In rich developed societies with modern attitudes to the role of women, fertility rates somewhat below replacement levels may thus be both inevitable and broadly welcome.
其中一种并不自然携带沃尔巴克氏菌的蚊子是伊蚊，但这种蚊子会传播包括登革热，奇昆古尼亚热病，黄热病，和寨卡在内的人类病毒。	One species where Wolbachia is not present naturally is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is responsible for transmitting human viruses like dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika.
香港 - - 《芝麻街》青蛙科米（Kermit the Frog）曾经哀叹 ， “ 生而绿，大不易 。 ”	HONG KONG – Sesame Street’s Kermit the Frog once lamented that “it’s not easy bein’ green.”
许多国家需要资金支持这些计划的实施，令人鼓舞的是，2015年巴黎气候协定成立了一个工作组解决气候相关的流离失所问题。	Many countries will need funding to implement such plans, and, encouragingly, the 2015 Paris climate agreement established a taskforce to address climate-related displacement.
如果商业情况良好，大家会一致支持将自由资本主义当作是政体的核心经济原则，金融市场可以得到发展，从而不愿承担司法系统组织所带来的风险。	If business conditions are auspicious and there is a strong consensus in favor of liberal capitalism as the polity’s core economic principle, financial markets can develop and reluctantly absorb risks stemming from the legal system’s defects.
大部分“退欧派”选民的感觉并没有转坏 （ “ 理性地”看，理应转坏才对 ） ， 反而认为境况会有所好转。	Instead of feeling worse off (as “rationally” they should), most “Leave” voters believe they will be better off.
而信贷渠道同样不甚通畅，因为银行已经囤积了来自量化宽松的大部分额外流动性，不但没有增加贷款，反而还产生了多余的储备。	The credit channel also is not working properly, as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from QE, creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending.
原子能-曾被认为是针对世界石油资源耗尽的主要技术防波堤-突然间受到了怀疑。 石油价格在年底再次翻番。	With nuclear power - regarded as the main technological bulwark against depletion of the world's oil supplies - suddenly suspect, oil prices doubled again by the year's end.
在美国，白人越来越认定自己将成为少数民族 — — 预计将在2045年实现的里程碑式事件 — — 并将此视为一种存续性威胁，并且往往表现得好像自己就是一个弱势群体。	In the United States, white people increasingly view the prospect that they will become a minority – a milestone expected to be reached in 2045 – as an existential threat, and often act as if they are a disadvantaged group.
事实上，随着成员国的国内政治在驾驭欧盟现行政策动向方面扮演了比欧洲理事会更重要的角色，即便实现一个跨政府形式的欧盟都比较渺茫。	In fact, with member states’ domestic politics playing a more important role than the European Council in driving whatever EU policy momentum exists, even an intergovernmental EU may be too much to hope for.
佛罗伦萨 — — 我们都认识历次银行大危机的一个产物：痛苦而长期的经济干扰；但它们的另一些产物却出人意料。	FLORENCE – Severe banking crises bring painful and long-lasting disruptions. But they also lead to surprises.
它提供的电费要低于客户用燃油照明的成本，目前为肯尼亚、乌干达和坦桑尼亚的330,000多户低收入家庭提供太阳能电力。	By delivering electricity at lower prices than their customers would otherwise have to pay for kerosene lighting, M-KOPA has delivered solar power to more than 330,000 low-income households in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.
比如在选举后危机的威胁下，伊朗最初同意在日内瓦提出的 10 月 1 号方案，允许将伊朗拥有的铀在第三国进行受监控的浓缩。	Thus, initially intimidated by the post-election crisis, the regime acceded to the October 1 proposal in Geneva that would have allowed the controlled enrichment of Iran’s uranium outside the country.
Tout comme en Europe, la révolution industrielle en Chine et en Inde crée une nouvelle classe moyenne ambitieuse, désireuse et capable d’envoyer ses enfants à l’université.	Just as in Europe, the industrial revolution in “Chindia” is also creating an ambitious new middle class that is willing and able to send its children to university.
麦肯锡全球研究院调研了包括煤炭，钢铁，自动制造业和零售业在内的2000多家中国企业，并认为到2030年有机会将生产效率提升20~100 ％ 。	When the McKinsey Global Institute analyzed more than 2,000 Chinese companies in industries ranging from coal and steel to auto manufacturing and retail, it found opportunities to raise productivity by 20-100% by 2030.
可以想见，一位对公司税改革的经济学和政治学有着深刻理解的政治老手总统，会力推国会通过有意义的改革方案。	A politically astute president who understood deeply the economics and politics of corporate tax reform could conceivably muscle Congress toward a reform package that made sense.
但是，如果特朗普沿着保护主义的道路继续走下去，美国贸易伙伴会发动报复，通常是采取直接针对其票仓的手段，比如，欧盟最近威胁要对肯塔基波旁酒征收关税。	If Trump goes down the protectionist road, however, US trade partners will retaliate, often with measures targeted directly at his base, as when the European Union recently threatened tariffs against Kentucky bourbon.
与此同时，头脑比较冷静的人会尽力推迟2007年对石油富城基尔库克最终态势的公民投票，因为这样的投票可能导致分裂。	At the same time, cooler heads will struggle to postpone a potentially divisive 2007 referendum on the final status of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.
如果允许医生、计算机专家或者工程师（更不用提众所周知的波兰管道工！ ）自由流动，人才汇集于最富有国家几乎肯定将增加。	If doctors, computer specialists, or engineers (let alone the proverbial Polish plumbers!) were allowed to move freely, the concentration of talent in the richest countries would most likely increase.
美国还必须处理可能出现的腐败现象，如转移Teamster公司的退休金资源是非法的，而制药公司的游说议员向彬彬有礼的国会成员提供活动捐款是合法的。	America must also deal with the potential for corruption, both illegal in the case of the diversion of Teamsters’ pension resources and legal in the campaign contributions provided by the pharmaceutical lobby to complaisant members of Congress.
他显然没有注意到与他共同获得诺贝尔奖的联合国政府间气候变化专家小组的发现，他们得出结论本世纪海平面的上升幅度只会在半英尺到两英尺左右，而他们预计最后的幅度应该在一英尺左右。	He ignores the findings of his Nobel co-winners, the IPCC, who conclude that sea levels will rise between only a half-foot and two feet over this century, with their best expectation being about one foot.
以智商和情商为代表的评估个人能力的现有范例均无法有效评估人能否与日渐壮大的“机器领”劳动大军相抗衡。	Neither of the existing paradigms for assessing individual potential – intelligence quotient and emotional quotient – can assess a person’s ability to compete against the growing “robo-collar” workforce.
马德里—1996年，内塔尼亚胡发动大量选民反对时任总理佩雷斯的传闻的“耶路撒冷分治”意图，并凭此赢得大选。	MADRID – Back in 1996, Binyamin Netanyahu won a general election by mobilizing large constituencies against then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres’s alleged intention to “divide Jerusalem.”
其次，投资者可能记得，在2008年的金融恐慌中，处于震中的美元由于恐慌影响覆盖面非常广，反而有所升值。	Second, investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic, the consequences radiated so widely that, paradoxically, the dollar actually rose in value.
身为全球公民，保护人类生命 — — 即使在战争和灾难等极端条件下 — — 一也应当成为我们所关注的任务。	The protection of human life – even in the midst of war and disasters – should be a concern for all of us, as global citizens.
这里的要害是，根据法律，美国银行的担保海外分支必须遵守许多美国规则，包括关于经营、透明度和清算（衍生品如何实际交易）的规则。	The trick here is that a de jure guaranteed foreign subsidiary of a US bank would have to comply with many US rules, including those governing conduct, transparency, and clearing (how the derivatives are actually traded).
执政的日本民主党目前身陷首相菅直人与政治掮客小泽一郎权力斗争的事实表明严肃的经济改革并不是民主党眼中的头等大事。	That the ruling Democratic Party of Japan now seems trapped in a power struggle between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and party power broker Ichiro Ozawa suggests that serious economic reform is not at the top of the DPJ agenda.
IFO经济景气指数已经存在了半个世纪，据路透社的一项民意调查，它是欧洲最著名的经济指标，甚至超过了欧盟官方的指标。	It has been produced for half a century, and, according to a poll conducted by Reuters, it is Europe’s most prominent business indicator, outperforming even official EU indicators.
十年期美国国债的实际利率（基于美国财政部的抗通胀债券）已经从2016年的零涨到了一年前的0.4 ％ ， 再到如今的0.8 ％ 。	The real rate on the ten-year US Treasury bond (based on the Treasury’s inflation-protected bonds) has gone from zero in 2016 to 0.4% a year ago to 0.8% now.
摩洛哥的妇女运动在世俗教和宗教团体之间架设了一座桥梁，为在传统社会中发挥社会思潮的力量设立了一个榜样。	The women’s movement in Morocco – which now bridges secular and religious communities – is setting an example of the power of social thought in a traditional society.
在芬兰，20世纪90年代初我们的援助减少了62 % ， 芬兰人到现在仍将这一时期称之为“经济萧条期 ” 。	Here in Finland, our aid decreased by 62% in the early 1990’s, a period that Finns still call “The Depression.”
投资者信心正在进一步修复，比如最近发行的100亿欧元（折合138亿美元）十年期西班牙政府债券就得到了4倍的超额认购。	Investor confidence is on the mend, exemplified by the recent placement of €10 billion ($13.8 billion) in ten-year government bonds – which was over-subscribed by four times.
但很难相信特朗普，或米勒和班农这样的特朗普的智囊，有兴趣扩大民主权利，即使他们假装在为普通 — — 或者用他们喜欢的用词 — — “真正的”人民说话。	But it is hard to believe that Trump, or his ideologues, like Miller or Bannon, are interested in expanding democratic rights, even though they pretend to speak for the common – or as they like to say – “real” people.
第一个假设是贸易的收益天然能够被大部分人所分享，或者直接得到，或者通过增长加快的经济体的合理再分配政策获得。	The first assumption was that the benefits of trade would naturally be shared by most of the population, either directly or because of appropriate redistribution policies implemented in the now-faster growing economies.
他对解决方法的评估也同样简单明了 ： “ 真实公正的和平及终止军备竞赛与美国及其盟国和苏联及其盟国双方的深层次利益相互吻合 。 ”	And his assessment of its solvability was equally concise: “[B]oth the United States and its allies, and the Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race.”
事实上，幸运地获得世界储备货币发行权的政府能够实现这一目标而不必让未来纳税人背上过度沉重的债务负担。	Indeed, those governments lucky enough to issue the world’s reserve currencies are able to take on this role without overloading future taxpayers with inordinate debt burdens.
1999年成为尼日利亚第一位民选总统的奥巴桑乔在近二十年的军事独裁统治后，于去年将一个为贫所困的国家交给了Yar’Adua。	Olusegun Obasanjo, who became Nigeria’s first elected president in 1999 after nearly two decades of military dictatorship, left vast swathes of the country trapped in poverty when he handed power to Yar’Adua last year.
更直接的后果是如果加沙家庭的生活继续窘迫下去，那么爆发跨边界暴力，甚至是第三次就地起义都只是一个时间问题。	More immediately, if Gazan families are not well fed, the recurrence of cross-border violence, if not the eruption of a third intifada, will only be a matter of time.
对于那些经济健全的汇率机制成员国，市场也会检验其政策制定者的决心，尤其是在突发重大事件或是大选之时。	Markets also tested the resolve of policymakers in otherwise sound ERM countries, particularly when there were big strikes or important elections.
在仅仅一年内，欧元区国家政府的普通债务就上升了大约10 % （ 从2008年的占GDP69.3%上升到2009年的78.7 % ） 。	Within a single year, eurozone governments’ general debt increased by almost 10 percentage points (78.7% of GDP in 2009, compared with 69.3% in 2008).
而这种逻辑跳跃似乎在6月召开的峰会上得到了更多信任，在那次峰会上金正恩重申“他坚定不移地致力于实现朝鲜半岛的无核化 。 ”	And this leap of logic seemed to gain more credence at the summit in June, where Kim “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
在最近的埃塞俄比亚亚的斯亚贝巴非洲经济会议上，领导人承诺继续将治理改革列为非洲日程的重中之重，但他们并没有给出路线图。	Although leaders at a recent African Economic Conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, committed to keeping governance reforms at the top of Africa’s agenda, they offered no blueprint.
但是，尽管背负债务或许是罪恶的，但《马太福音》6:12节支持赦免 ： “ 原谅我们的债务，正如我们也原谅了我们的债务人 。 ”	But, though it might be sinful to go into debt, Matthew 6:12 supports absolution: “forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.”
但这种“占据经济制高点”的模式由于其严重表现不佳而遭到了摈弃，尤其当国有企业在竞争中受到保护时（这已经成为常态 ） 。	This “commanding heights of the economy” model was rejected largely because it seriously under-performed, especially when state-owned sectors were protected from competition (as was the norm).
而齐亚哈克的去世为巴基斯坦人迎来了另一位民选非军人总理：扎比卡尔·阿里的女儿贝纳齐尔·布托（Benazir Bhutto ） ， 也是众多穆斯林人口占多数国家中的第一位女性最高领导人。	Zia’s death brought to power another democratically elected civilian prime minister: Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of Zulfikar Ali and the first woman to lead a Muslim-majority country.
但是，由于这类罚款具有不确定性，银行和银行高管很难预测它的发生，因此它对长期组织激励的影响尚不清楚。	But, because such fines are erratic and difficult for banks and banking executives to predict, their impact on long-term organizational incentives is unclear.
类似地，俄罗斯也是一个狭隘的经济体，执政的政府专注于保把持国内权力和重建俄罗斯在中东和欧洲的影响力。	Likewise, Russia is a country with a narrowly-based economy led by a government focused on retaining power at home and re-establishing Russian influence in the Middle East and Europe.
这种行为可以量化为网络的“集聚系数 ” （ clustering coefficient ） — —即某人的朋友们彼此也是朋友的概率 — — 并且不同都市区之间保持不同寻常的稳定性。	This behavior is quantified as the networks’ “clustering coefficient” – that is, the probability that a person’s friends will also be friends with one another – and remains extraordinarily stable across metropolitan areas.
无论那个触发因素是什么，对美国的影响都可能相当严重，原因很简单：美国政府继续推行顺周期财政、宏观审慎以及平稳货币政策。	Whatever the immediate trigger, the consequences for the US are likely to be severe, for a simple reason: the US government continues to pursue pro-cyclical fiscal, macro-prudential, and even monetary policies.
最后，应该成立地区性论坛更好地约束军事部署，包括采取增强信心的措施以降低军事事件风险以及在军事事件发生时有助于管理。	Finally, a regional forum should be established to regulate better the deployment of military force, including confidence-building measures to reduce the risk of incidents and to help manage them if they occur.
美国的国际竞争力正在衰退，穷人则受到忽视 — — 五分之一的美国儿童陷于贫困 — — 而且给年轻人留下堆积如山的债务。	America is losing its international competitiveness, neglecting its poor – one in five American children is trapped in poverty – and leaving a mountain of debt to its young.
2012年，国防部光是在电子工程 和计算机科学领域就投资了13亿美元，而美国科学基金会（National Science Foundation）也投资了9亿美元。	In 2012, the defense department invested $1.3 billion in electrical engineering and computer science alone, while the National Science Foundation invested another $900 million.
自然生态系统生产的商品即原材料，服务即保持大气中的氧气、传粉植物、清洁的空气和水，甚至为我们提供美感和志向。	Our natural ecosystems produce goods in the form of raw materials and services such as maintaining oxygen in the atmosphere, pollinating plants, cleaning air and water, and even providing us with beauty and inspiration.
毕竟中国不仅是阿富汗的邻国，还是全世界最重要的新兴势力 — — 事实上正如美国参谋长联席会议主席迈克·马伦在7月访问北京时所说那样，是一个“世界大国 ” 。	After all, China is not merely a neighbor of Afghanistan, but the world’s most important rising power – indeed, a “world power,” as Mike Mullen, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff proclaimed in Beijing this past June.
去年，东盟+3建立了一个区域监察机构 — — 东盟+3宏观经济研究室 — — 来监测区域经济，探测新出现的脆弱节点，并为协议的有效决策提供支持。	Last year, ASEAN+3 established a regional surveillance unit, the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), to monitor regional economies, detect emerging vulnerabilities, and support effective decision-making by the CMIM.
心存疑虑的领导人会从政治上最方便的项目开始，而激进的领导人会从最有挑战性的内容开始；但哪种方法能产生预期效果，谁也打不了包票。	Apprehensive leaders start with the most politically expedient items, while bold leaders start with the most challenging prescriptions; but there is no guarantee that either of these approaches will deliver the expected result.
此外，由于人们对法国竞争力日程抱有极高期望，因此我们必须确保加快实施国民公约，从而在2013年就开始收获成效。	And, because expectations for France’s competitiveness agenda are high, we will ensure swift implementation of the National Pact so that it can start producing results as soon as 2013.
事实上，有些人已经开始质疑由掌握市场份额的少数几家大型企业搜集和控制海量数据是否会给可能进入的创新者带来无法逾越的进入障碍，并因此违反竞争原则。	Indeed, some have begun to ask whether the collection and control of large amounts of data by a few huge firms with commanding market shares can be an anticompetitive force, creating insurmountable entry barriers for would-be innovators.
但如今对自由的高谈阔论却难以掩盖这场人民“革命”最终演变成一场军事接管的事实，数十年的紧急状态法依然有效，而国家的政治方向却难以捉摸。	Yet today’s heady talk of freedom cannot obscure the reality that the people’s “revolution” has so far led only to a direct military takeover, with the decades-old emergency law still in force and the country’s political direction uncertain.
如果协议失败，德国可能会举行新一轮选举 — — 这显然是一个风险很大的选择，因为近期民意调查显示选择党可能借此赢得更多选票，而基民盟和社民党的支持可能会下降。	If the agreement fails, Germany might hold a fresh election – a risky option, to be sure, as recent polls indicate that the AfD could win an even larger share of the vote, while support for the CDU and the SPD could decline.
此外，尽管土耳其同意北约在其国内部署反导弹雷达系统，最近还扣留了一艘叙利亚注册的武装船只，这可能会取悦西方，但在这些事件中，土耳其的政策仍以“硬”军力为焦点。	And, while Turkey’s agreement to host NATO anti-missile radar facilities, and its recent seizure of a Syrian-registered arms ship, may please the West, here, too, its policies are focused on “hard” military power.
与NCD有关的大部分健康问题 — — 慢性病痛、睡眠不规律、压抑、残疾和过早死亡 — — 大多与晚期或复杂病症，而不是早期和非复杂病症有关。	Most health problems linked to NCDs – problems such as chronic pain, disordered sleep, depression, disability, and premature death – are associated with late-stage or complicated disease, rather than with early-stage or uncomplicated disease.
根据这一逻辑，2009年出生的女性的平均寿命预期应该已经超过88年；但目前的人口测算认为，2060年前出生的新生儿都无法得到这一平均寿命预期。	By this logic, a woman born in 2009 should have already had an average life expectancy of more than 88 years; but current population estimates do not foresee that average life expectancy for newborns until 2060.
他出演自己亲自作词的流行音乐电视 — — 他最著名的作品是《爱情充电器 》 （ Love Charger ） ， 还有一部描写他本人的故事片《MSG：神的信使 》 （ MSG: The Messenger of God ） 。	He performed in popular music videos of his own composition – his biggest hit is called “Love Charger” – and had a feature film made about himself called MSG: The Messenger of God.
但生活在大城市地区之外的年纪教长的人反而支持竖起藩篱并 — — 在相当大的程度上 — — 尝试将英国与世界其他部分隔离。	But older people, living outside large urban areas, have voted instead to build barriers and – to a significant extent – attempt to close off the country from the rest of the world.
传统规则制度彻底被战争羞辱，合法性的真空被强大的煽动者和民粹主义独裁填补 ： “ 最好的人没人信，最坏的人充满激情 。 ”	With the traditional institutions of rule thoroughly discredited by the war, the vacuum of legitimacy would be filled by powerful demagogues and populist dictatorships: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst/are full of passionate intensity.”
这样我们才能更好的了解她们，而不是把时间都浪费在聒噪地争论这些女性，以及千千万万个同她们一样卓有成就的穆斯林女性应该如何穿着上。	We would do better to find out more about them than to waste our time on superficial debates about how they – and many others who are just as accomplished – should dress.
取消国家主席任期限制为习近平主席和王岐山副主席实现这一长期愿景铺平了道路，从而提高了中国未来发展取得成功的机率。	By removing the presidential term limit, China’s leadership is improving its chances of success, by opening the way for Xi and his vice president, Wang Qishan, to go further in realizing this vision.
通过揭示传统风险评估方法所不能揭示的弱点，我们可以让结构性改革、行为改变和增加韧性要求的战略投资更精确。	By revealing underlying weaknesses that more traditional risk-assessment methods may miss, we could pinpoint the structural reforms, behavioral changes, and strategic investments that increased resilience requires.
首先，无论在弗拉基米尔·普金和德米特里·梅德维杰夫治下的新俄罗斯行事多么蛮横，苏联已经不复存在，也不再构成对欧美的共同威胁，这种威胁直到1989年都把欧美黏在一起。	First, whatever the brutal style of the new Russia under Vladimir Putin and Dmitri Medvedev, the Soviet Union no longer exists and no longer constitutes the common threat that was the “glue” of the Alliance until 1989.
而且50多万人丧生1000万人流离失所的叙利亚也暴露了人们大肆吹捧的“保护责任 ” （ responsibility to protect）原则的缺陷。	And, with more than 500,000 dead and another ten million displaced in Syria, the much-vaunted doctrine of the “responsibility to protect” (R2P) has been exposed as well.
我们利用一个涵盖占全球GDP三成左右的20,000家上市公司的数据库，研究符合四大创新“原型 ” — —专注客户、效率驱动、基于工程和基于科学 — — 的产业的全球收入。	Using a database of 20,000 public companies representing about 30% of global GDP, we looked at global revenue in industries that fit four innovative “archetypes”: customer-focused, efficiency-driven, engineering-based, and science-based.
至于伊朗伊斯兰共和国，继任总统哈桑·鲁哈尼或许愿意就核野心问题与世界其他国家达成协议 — — 又或许他不愿意。	As for the Islamic Republic, incoming President Hassan Rowhani may want to reach an agreement with the world on the country’s nuclear ambition – or he may not.
由于国际货币基金组织寻求服务于全球成员，因此这对于它而言尤其如此，而且还引发了有关该基金战略方向的极为重要的讨论。	This has been particularly true of the IMF as it seeks to serve its global membership, and it has triggered a critically important discussion of the Fund’s strategic direction.
这些缺陷在社会丛林计划（Socio Bosque Program）中尽显无疑。 社会丛林计划是REDD+的一个厄瓜多尔项目，它着眼于控制森林社区和农民耕作，却忽略了工业活动带来的远远更加巨大的潜在伤害。	These shortcomings are exemplified in the Socio Bosque Program, a REDD+ initiative in Ecuador, in which efforts to control forest communities and peasant farming overlook the far larger potential damage caused by industrial activity.
事实上，英国选民多数支持人口自由流动，前提是自由流动不被宣传为外国官僚机构强加的反民主政治条件，而是被作为英国和欧盟民众共同享有的一种权利。	In fact, British voters mostly support free movement, if it is presented not as an anti-democratic imposition by foreign bureaucrats, but rather as a right that British and EU citizens reciprocally enjoy.
周因为手持中华民国国旗拍照而在华遭到攻击，而她为此事在YouTube上发布的公开道歉提醒了岛上很多人中国愿意在多大程度上迫使人保持沉默。	Chou came under fire in China after posing for a picture while holding the Taiwanese flag, and her public apology for doing so – made on YouTube – reminded many on the island of the degree to which China is willing to pressure people into silence.
于是，个人和企业能够通过将钱从常规银行账户，以类同于他们今天缴税的方式，转移到TFN连接账户，增加其信用。	Individuals and firms will then be able to add credit to their TFN-linked account by transferring money from their normal bank account, in the same way that they do today to pay their taxes.
过度的社会福利开支（主要是公共养老金）和偿付国债的费用将资源从高效的政府开支领域抽走，形成了高额的税收负担。	Excessive social welfare spending (mainly public pensions) and the cost of servicing the public debt drain resources from more productive government spending and impose a high tax burden.
在经历了几十年的僵局和困境后，也许如今它可以较少地顾忌自身的生存，更多地专注于帮助实现正义持久的和平了。	After decades of standoffs and stalemate, perhaps it can focus less on its own survival and more on helping to achieve a just and lasting peace.
但是，尽管存在这些问题，能源和电力改革以及由此带来的与美国和加拿大关系的深化有利于加快墨西哥经济增长，提振就业和收入，从而提高墨西哥人民的生活水平。	But, despite such problems, the energy and electricity reforms, and the deeper links with the US and Canada that they imply, promises to accelerate Mexico’s growth rate, boost employment and income, and thus raise Mexicans’ standard of living.
在担任古吉拉特邦首席部长期间，莫迪致力于鼓励外国投资、提供24小时供电、建设公路并着手进行智能城市规划。	As Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi worked to encourage foreign investment, provide around-the-clock electricity, build roads, and engage in intelligent urban planning.
在关于中美联合研究项目中，朱将清洁能源说成“我们这个时代中美合作关系中最大的一个机会 ” ， 并且说“联合起来比各自为战的效果要好很多 ” 。	In announcing a new Sino-US joint research effort, Chu described clean energy as “one of the great opportunities of our time” for Sino-US cooperation, saying that by “working together, we can accomplish more than [by] acting alone.”
主要国家承认伊朗拥有和日本类似的核地位的意愿不仅仅取决于伊朗是否将自己作为一个危机时的大国－它偶尔这样作－而且取决于它是否这样行为。	The willingness of major countries to accept Iran with a nuclear status similar to Japan depends on whether Iran not only refers to itself as a status-quo power – which it occasionally does – but whether it acts as such.
随着战后一代老去 — — 他们大部分人至少已经60岁，其领袖要么身居高位，要么是资深政客 — — 对一体化的支持正在消失。	As the post-war generation ages – with most of its members now at least 60 years old and its leaders either in senior leadership positions or acting as senior statesmen – the remaining support for integration is waning.
苏格兰第一大臣、苏格兰民族党领袖尼古拉·斯特金（Nicola Sturgeon）抨击威斯敏斯特围绕财政整合计划的“愉快共识 ” 。	Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP, attacked the “cozy consensus” around fiscal consolidation in Westminster.
自从1997年6月26日这位年轻的魔法师首次露面以来，这个“大难不死的男孩”已经成为“坚韧隐忍的象征 ” 。	Since the young wizard’s first appearance on June 26, 1997, the “Boy Who Lived” has become the “Icon Who Endures.”
美联储透露这一决策完全没有考虑高通胀的风险，并急于将失业率推低至大多数经济学家认为的“自然”失业率（约5 % ） 以下。	The Fed revealed that it was entirely unconcerned about the risks of higher inflation and was eager to push unemployment below what most economists regard as its “natural” rate of around 5%.
尽管这种服务目前还只是针对个人，但许多公司也可以借助HealthRally公司来改善自身的健康福利项目。	While the service is currently designed for individuals, companies could also use HealthRally to enhance their corporate wellness programs.
德拉吉经济学的第三个要素 — — 类似于安倍经济学的QQE — — 是以购买公公债券和提振私人部门信用增长的措施为形式的量化和信用扩张。	The third element of Draghinomics – similar to the QQE of Abenomics – will be quantitative and credit easing in the form of purchases of public bonds and measures to boost private-sector credit growth.
第三，德国的长期利率不会受到影响，因为德国既不需要担保该债务转换机制，也不需要支持欧洲央行的债券发行。	Third, Germany’s long-term interest rates would be unaffected, because Germany would neither be guaranteeing the debt-conversion scheme nor backing the ECB’s bond issues.
好消息是我们有很多办法可以通过改善后的激励机制减少（温室气体的）排放—其中一个办法是取消对低效使用能源的种种补贴。	The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions – partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages.
黑色星期一后一天，经济部长乌留卡耶夫（Alexey Ulyukaev）表示CBR本应该更快提高利率。	The day after Black Monday, Minister of Economy Alexey Ulyukaev said that the CBR should have increased interest rates sooner.
在17世纪和18世纪里，德国移民，即所谓的德裔宾州人，将这一传统带到了美国，并从那里传扬到全世界，就好像为可口可乐打造市场品牌一样。	In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, German immigrants, the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch, carried them to the United States, from where they later spread to the rest of the world, if only as marketing icons for Coca Cola.
历史学家可能会就该学院存在与否及所起作用争论不休；但它在伊斯兰世界依然具备的象征意义远比这样的争论更加重要。	Historians may bicker over whether such an academy truly existed and what function it served; but such arguments are less relevant than the symbolic power it still holds in the Islamic world.
我加入了卫生支持组织普及挑战组织（Access Challenge ） ， 发起了今年联合国大会的非正式议程“一个接一个：目标2030 ” （ One by One: Target 2030）项目。	That is why I joined with the health advocacy organization Access Challenge to launch the “One by One: Target 2030” campaign on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this year.
安塔利亚 — — 最近由哈利法·塔希夫塔将军领导的利比亚政变终于彻底戳穿了该国政令出不了首都的黎波里的孱弱中央政府能够有效执政的幻觉。	ANTALYA – The recent coup attempt in Libya, led by General Khalifa Hiftar, has finally pierced the illusion that the country’s dysfunctional central government, whose power is limited to the capital, Tripoli, can rule effectively.
如今许多发展中国家 — — 尤其是亚洲各国 — — 的宏观经济形势都比1990年代末亚洲金融危机或是2008年全球金融危机爆发前要更好。	Many developing countries – especially in Asia – are in much better macroeconomic shape than they were just before the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s or at the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis.
与此同时，方济各的耶稣会背景让他拥有一定程度的独立性和���聪明（比如若无其事突然同时封圣若望二十三世和若望·保禄二世 ） 。	At the same time, Francis’s Jesuit background has instilled in him a certain independence and flair for the quirky (like nonchalantly sanctifying John XXIII and John Paul II in one fell swoop).
从这个角度讲，正如哥伦比亚大学的贾格迪什·巴格瓦蒂（Jagdish Bhagwati）对我所说 ， “ TPP就像是个高尔夫俱乐部，你可以进去打球，但你必须和其他会员去同一间教堂做礼拜 。 ”	In that sense, as Columbia University’s Jagdish Bhagwati said to me, “the TPP was a bit like allowing people to play golf in a club, but only if they also attended a particular church over the weekend.”
但是正如法国刚刚展示的那样，虽然向选民推销欧盟一体化可能是轻而易举，但财政治理才是对欧元存续能力的真正考验。	But as France has just demonstrated, selling EU integration to the electorate might be the easy part. Fiscal governance will be the true test of the euro’s staying power.
气候变化否定者 — — 那些拒绝相信人为造成全球变暖这一科学事实的人 — — 继续否定防止地球温度升高的作用，认为这样做既徒劳无功又毫无必要。	Climate-change deniers – those who refuse to believe the science of human-induced global warming – continue to dismiss any such effort to stem the rise in the planet’s temperature as futile and unnecessary.
那如果我们只是把女权主义的理念主要表述为一系列的成就和苛责，而不是将其理解为对各种自由的延伸 — — 有时也包括不懈追求完美的自由，又会怎么样呢？	What if we have externalized the feminist ideal primarily as a set of accomplishments and rigors, rather than embracing it as an expansion of all kinds of freedom – which can also sometimes include freedom from eternal aspiration?
目前，我们还与美国国际开发署进行合作，这是一个叫作“优化 ” （ OPTIMIZE）的合作项目的一部分，其目的是加快新疗法的普及。	And we are currently working with the US Agency for International Development as part of a partnership called OPTIMIZE, which aims to accelerate access to new therapies.
但历史和经济理论表明人们对技术失业问题（这个词由约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯在近一个世纪前发明）的焦虑是没有道理的。	History and economic theory, however, suggest that anxieties about technological unemployment, a term coined by John Maynard Keynes nearly a century ago, are misplaced.
他们也许永远不会忘记，以色列的命运至关重要，绝不容用来作为任性又粗俗的冒险家彰显权威或所谓的交易天才的。	May they never forget that Israel’s fate is too serious of a matter to be used as a pretext for an impulsive, uncultured adventurer to demonstrate his authority or supposed deal-making talents.
如果某项共识能赋予所有成员国责任去追求共同利益，那么寻求公识的手段才能起作用，因为成员国只会对与某些根本利益相违背的决定提出正式反对。	A consensus-based approach can work only if it entails an obligation by all members to work toward shared interests, with members objecting formally only to decisions running counter to some fundamental interest.
东京—日本正处在一个比以往任何时候都更有利于其在确保亚洲和世界和平的问题上起到更大更积极作用的位置。	TOKYO – Japan is in a better position than ever before to play a larger and more proactive role in ensuring peace in Asia and the world.
我们生活在一个对通胀和通缩的两大恐惧同时并存的时代；既有前所未有的繁荣，又有不断扩大的不平等；一方面科技进步，另一方面则存在资源枯竭。	We live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation; of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality; and of technological advancement and resource depletion.
美军入侵阿富汗时最初被当成解放者，但是北约在没有适当的参与计划情况下就参加进来，经过八年时间后，外国军队不再受到欢迎。	The American forces invading Afghanistan were originally welcomed as liberators, but NATO got involved without a proper plan of engagement, and after eight years the presence of foreign troops is no longer welcome.
他的去职将使该国意识形态基础的时代性错误暴露无余，而家族关系丝毫无助于防止他的继任者给现有国家制度带来的冲击。	His departure would expose the anachronistic nature of the state’s ideological foundation; family ties will do nothing to protect his successor from the resulting shock to the system.
即使当加州的公路破旧不堪以及公共机构衰败的时候-这是开支太少和公共工人太昂贵所造成的-加州继续经营着美国最好的公立大学。	Even as California’s roads fall apart and public institutions decline – the result of too little spending and public workers who are too expensive – the state continues to operate the finest set of public universities in the US.
在酒类管制方面的经验告诉我们，不管将法定年龄定得多低，大麻都将最终蔓延到那些不符合年龄的人群当中（正如现在这样 ） 。	Experience with alcohol suggests that marijuana will be available to underage users (as it is now), whatever the minimum legal age.
"NGO没有强迫性的""硬""权力，但却往往拥有相当的""软""权力-一种通过吸引而不是强迫来达到目的的能力。"	"NGO's do not have coercive ""hard"" power, but they often enjoy considerable ""soft"" power - the ability to get the outcomes they want through attraction rather than compulsion."
最后一项要点是，长期的体制改革，如，劳动力市场改革，增加了市场灵活性却并未导致大规模的裁员（这种模式在德国成功施行 ） 。	Last but not least, there are longer-term structural reforms, such as labor-market reforms that increase flexibility without leading to large-scale lay-offs (a model rather successfully implemented by Germany).
终止救援就会影响到8000万人民的生活，造成该国地区的不稳定，引发埃塞俄比亚和邻国索马里和厄立特里亚新一轮的冲突。	Cutting off aid could have calamitous humanitarian consequences for the nation’s 80 million people. It could also destabilize a fragile region, sparking fresh wars with neighboring Somalia and Eritrea.
诚然，休斯顿和德州本身并没有让温室气体增加很多，尽管它们本可以在推动强势气候政策方面扮演更加积极的角色。	To be sure, Houston and Texas could not have done much by themselves about the increase in greenhouse gases, though they could have taken a more active role in pushing for strong climate policies.
保卫银行部门健康的果断措施之所以必不可少，不但是因为这样能够减轻困扰市场的风险，也因为健康的金融机构是经济增长的基石。	Decisive steps to safeguard the banking sector’s health are necessary not only to reduce some of the risks that are preoccupying markets, but also because healthy financial institutions are vital for economic growth.
资源的短缺不仅大大削弱了UNRWA为巴勒斯坦难民提供基本服务的能力，也威胁着已经命悬一线的约旦河西岸、加沙、叙利亚、黎巴嫩和约旦的稳定。	Beyond reducing substantially the UNRWA’s capacity to deliver basic services to Palestinian refugees, the shortage of resources will also threaten the already tenuous stability of the West Bank, Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.
为逐步采取更有效、更主动的治理形式，中东地区国家需要创造重新分配权力和促进合作的空间，推进真正的政治和民间社会倡议。	To move to a more effective, proactive form of governance, Middle Eastern countries need to create a space for genuine politics and civil-society initiatives that redistribute power and foster cooperation.
像土地、矿产和碳氢化合物这样的公共资源和电信频谱价值迅猛增长，在这场资源控制争夺战中，商人们开始寻求捷径。	Public resources, like land, minerals, and hydrocarbons, and the telecommunications spectrum, have shot up in value, and in the scramble to control them, businessmen seek shortcuts.
录影带出租点、连锁书店、药店、家装卖场、电子产品和相机店、邮购商店，如此等等：它们都走上了四轮马车的老路。	Video rentals, bookstore chains, pharmacies, home improvement stores, electronics and camera shops, catalog stores, and more: all went the way of the horse and buggy.
但那些研究重点迥异且与今天能造就或毁灭学术/科研生涯的专业期刊鲜有联系的科学家和其他学者（比方说中东学者）又该怎么办？	But what happens to scientists and other scholars, such as those in the Middle East, who have different research concerns from – and scant connections to – the professional journals that can make or break an academic/scientific career?
哈拉雷—创办企业可能是个艰难的工作，特别是在非洲，这里治理体系很弱，难以持续获得关键资源，这些因素阻碍着成功。	HARARE – Launching a business can be hard work, especially in Africa, where weak governance systems and inconsistent access to critical resources impede success.
中国一直在搞所谓的“卖方融资 ” ， 也就是提供资金资助美国的财政和贸易赤字，让美国人进口更多的产品，其数量大于其出口。	China has been engaged in what might be called “vendor finance,” providing the money that helps finance the huge US fiscal and trade deficits, allowing Americans to buy more goods than they sell.
"10多年前，克林顿总统的首任财长劳埃德·本特森曾试图达到这个目标，提议设立""BTU税收""来解决美国的财政赤字。"	"A little more than a decade ago, Lloyd Bentsen, President Bill Clinton's first Treasury Secretary, tried to ensure precisely that, proposing to use a ""BTU tax"" to close America's fiscal deficit."
而对于公共商品 — — 如教育、环境、医疗和机会平等 — — 资本主义经济的记录便不那么令人瞩目了，而随着资本主义经济走向成熟，改善的政治障碍似乎也在提高。	When it comes to public goods – such as education, the environment, health care, and equal opportunity – the record is not quite as impressive, and the political obstacles to improvement have seemed to grow as capitalist economies have matured.
正如弗朗索瓦·埃斯堡最近在文章中所写的那样 ， “ 德国公开考虑逼迫希腊[从欧元区]退出已经证明经济战胜了政治和战略方面的考虑。	As François Heisbourg recently wrote, “By openly contemplating the forced secession of Greece [from the eurozone], Germany has demonstrated that economics trumps political and strategic considerations.
约翰·米勒在其维护言论自由的经典著作《论自由》一书中写道，如果一个观点没有“得到完全、经常以及毫不畏惧地讨论 ” ， 它将成为“一个僵死的教条，而不是有活力的真理 。 ”	In his classic defense of freedom of speech in, On Liberty, John Stuart Mill wrote that if a view is not “fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed,” it will become “a dead dogma, not a living truth.”
全球贸易崩溃，中国出口需求年增长率从2008年年中的26%下降到2009年年初的-27 % ， 面对这一情况，政府果断行动，向经济注入4万亿元人民币。	With global trade collapsing and Chinese export demand having plummeted from 26% annual growth in mid-2008 to a 27% contraction by early 2009, the government moved aggressively to inject CN¥4 trillion ($586 billion) into the economy.
公私合作是为了治理私营部门和开放市场，以推动有利于公共利益的经济增长，同时时刻关注环境可持续和社会包容。	Public-private cooperation is about harnessing the private sector and open markets to drive economic growth for the public good, with environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness always in mind.
经过改良的水产养殖业可以将鱼类饲养在人工管理的池塘和水库，但这种技术目前还有待完善，特别是在环境保护领域还存在不少问题。 尽管存在种种缺点，但水产养殖技术的前景一片光明。	Improved aquaculture, in which fish are grown at manmade fishponds and reservoirs is still far from being a perfect technology, mainly for environmental reasons, yet it is enormously promising.
但是，要成功地进行对话，中国和美国 — — 它们自身仍然存在诸多分歧 — — 必须精诚合作，安理会的其他成员国也必须协助这一合作。	For talks to be successful, however, China and the US – which have plenty of disagreements of their own – must work together, and the other members of the UN Security Council must facilitate such cooperation.
如果雇主告诉他们的雇员说现在有一项养老金储蓄计划，甚至保证也交纳和雇员同样多的钱，很大一部分雇员依旧不会参加。	If employers tell their new employees that a pension saving plan is available, and even promise to match employees’ contributions, a significant fraction of employees still will not participate.
如果世界领导人在巴黎未能就将温度升高控制在两摄氏度以内的可靠措施达成一致，可持续发展目标将无法变为现实。	If world leaders in Paris do not agree to credible measures to keep a rise in temperatures to below two degrees Celsius, the SDGs will not be realized.
而尽管西侧的伊拉克与伊朗一样由什叶派占主导地位，但伊拉克的阿拉伯什叶派却毫不掩饰对波斯人及其什叶派地位主张的厌恶和反感。	And, while its western neighbor Iraq is a fellow Shia-majority state, Iraq’s Arab Shia make no secret of their distaste for the Persians and their claim to Shia prominence.
如果不问动机，只问身份，学院的学生 — — 德国人除外 — — 不会发自内心地首先将自己当作欧洲人。	Asked not about their motivations, but about their identities, the students from the College – with the exception of the Germans – do not naturally and spontaneously perceive themselves as Europeans first.
当然这样做的危险是，一旦对抗到来，无论何时，也无论是由于波利维亚、美洲自由贸易区、人权或者新闻自由等问题，想要平息都为时已晚。	The danger, of course, is that if and when confrontation comes – over Bolivia, the FTAA, human rights, or press freedoms – it will be too late to defuse it.
而能创造可持续工作职位的未来产业将是那些可以有效利用稀缺资源、同时承担得起这些资源背后承载的真实环境和健康成本的产业。	The industries of the future, which will create jobs that last, are those that will use scarce resources efficiently, and that can pay the real environmental and health costs of the resources that they use.
就在出院两天后，笔者到访了耶路撒冷的巴勒斯坦社区，这个被安全墙重重包围分割的地界不断提醒着人们该区域严酷冷峻的现实。	Two days after my hospital experience, a tour of the Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem – surrounded or divided by the security wall – served as a reminder of the region’s harsh and sobering realities.
这是一份写于56年前的文件，它代表着一个不同的世界，一个冷战、核末日威胁以及大量新晋独立穷国所面临的挑战占据决策者关注焦点的世界。	It is a text written 56 years ago, in a different world, where the Cold War, the threat of nuclear Armageddon, and the challenges faced by so many newly independent poor states dominated policymakers’ concerns.
发自剑桥 — — 美联储正就一项法律提案与国会议员进行交锋，该法案名为美国联邦储备委员会问责制和透明度法案，要求美联储使用正式的规则来指导货币政策。	CAMBRIDGE – The US Federal Reserve is battling with members of Congress over a proposed law, the Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act, that would require the Fed to use a formal rule to guide monetary policy.
简言之，政策变得越来越非传统，更有甚者，对它们的短期效果、不良后果和长期影响则越来越没有清晰的认识。	In short, policies are becoming more unconventional, not less, with little clarity about short-term effects, unintended consequences, and long-term impacts.
考量上述策略是否可行非常重要，不仅因为欧盟执行的是全世界涉及面最广、最雄心勃勃的气候政策，还因为其他气候政策也有着相似的缺陷。	It is important to examine this approach, not only because the EU is pursuing the world’s largest and most ambitious climate policy, but also because other climate policies suffer from similar shortcomings.
事情发生戏剧性转变后，事实上现在所有西方国家都得担心自己的信用评级了，而与此同时，不少新兴经济体的评级在持续上升。	In an amazing turn of events, virtually every Western country must now worry about its credit ratings, while quite a few emerging economies continue to climb the ratings ladder.
他不能接受合法的反对，也不能接受今天的多数可能是明天的少数、游戏规则必须让多数和少数都能发声的思想。	He appears to see no room for legitimate opposition, for the idea that today’s majority can be tomorrow’s minority and that the rules of the game must allow both to be heard.
但在离开的时候，我感到心烦意乱，觉得专业经济学家（特别是西方经济学家）大概应该重新评估他们的研究工作所需要考虑的道德和经济环境。	But I came away disturbed by the experience, wondering whether professional economists (particularly in the West) need to reassess the moral and political context in which they conduct their work.
美国再次与其他国家陷入不信任不确定的漩涡之中（全世界没有美国参与的无数冲突同样也是这样的状况 ） 。	The US is again caught in a spiral of distrust and uncertainty with other countries (and the same is true of countless conflicts around the world that do not involve the US).
但是，除非希腊能够提高其经济增长率，否则其预算将依然是赤字，其债务占GDP比重将依然在当前水平徘徊。	But, unless Greece is able to increase its rate of economic growth, the budget will remain in deficit and the debt will remain at nearly its current share of GDP.
不幸的是，最近的政治事件与促进民主活动的美国非政府组织有涉，这使得两国关系降了温，也威胁到了埃及每年从美国那里获得的13亿美元军事援助。	Unfortunately, the latest political incident involving the democracy-promoting activities of American NGOs has cooled bilateral relations and threatens the $1.3 billion in military assistance that Egypt receives annually from the United States.
出于对当前美联储保持低利率政策将导致更高通胀的担忧，该法案将要求美联储采取正式的程序设置其核心短期利率 — — “联邦基金利率 ” 。	Reflecting the fear that the Fed’s current policy of sustained low interest rates will lead to higher inflation, the law would require the Fed to adopt a formal procedure for setting its key short-term interest rate, the “federal funds rate.”
某些生物燃料比其他生物燃料更具成本效益并且更节能，而不同的生物燃料储备对于食品农业有着非常不同的机会成本（比如，糖的价格就基本上没有出现很大的上涨 ） 。	Some bio-fuels are far more cost-effective and energy-efficient than others, and different bio-fuel stocks have very different opportunity costs for food agriculture (sugar has not experienced any significant price increase).
现在唯一的问题就是祖布科夫或者他的继任者是否会最终成功地把弗拉基米尔沙皇也变成像普京的对手已经变成的同样的那种“非人 ” 。	The only question now is whether Zubkov, or his successor, will eventually succeed in turning Czar Vladimir into the same sort of non-person that Putin’s rivals have become.
因此，尽管民粹主义政策牺牲整体经济福利，但理性的选民仍会选择它，因为它们是区分不同类型政治家所付出的代价。	Thus, although populist policies reduce overall economic welfare, rational voters choose them because they are the price of distinguishing between different types of politicians.
其总理温家宝早在六年多之前就提出了这种可能性，他在2007年3月指出：看似辉煌的中国经济已经变得“不稳定、不平衡、不协调、并最终不可持续”了。	Premier Wen Jiabao addressed this possibility nearly six years ago, arguing in March 2007 that the seemingly spectacular Chinese economy had become “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and ultimately unsustainable.”
让进口品变得更加昂贵的新关税将促使需求向本国产品倾斜，在接近充分就业的经济状态，这需要抵消效应以使需求重新偏向外国。	New tariffs that made imports more costly and that shifted demand toward domestic goods would require offsetting effects in a near-full-employment economy in order to shift demand back to foreign sources.
如果这种情况伴随着中央情报局的调查报告，称俄罗斯情报机构攻击并且泄露特朗普竞选团队的邮件，导致他在竞选中陷入被动。	Imagine if this happened alongside CIA reports that Russian intelligence agencies had hacked and leaked Trump’s campaign emails to put him at a disadvantage.
作为好莱坞演员和美国总统，里根拥有一批聪明，专注和训练有素的专业人员来为​​他的攥写演讲辞并指导其一举一动。	Both as a Hollywood actor and as a US president, Reagan had smart, dedicated, and trained professionals writing his lines and directing his moves.
诺贝尔经济学奖获得者萨缪尔逊（Paul Samuelson）在1948年观察到，国际贸易导致因素价格趋同，不同国家经技能水平调整的工资趋于均衡。	As the Nobel laureate economist Paul Samuelson observed in 1948, international trade leads to factor-price equalization, with wages, adjusted for skill levels, equilibrating across countries.
相反，你可能弄不清楚美国总统奥巴马是否不应该学习俾斯麦，而应该学习领导普鲁士统一德国的铁血首相俾斯麦。	By contrast, one may wonder whether US President Barack Obama should not also learn from Bismarck – but from Bismarck the Iron Chancellor, who united Germany behind Prussia.
但只要它仍然不进行公正的审判，继续扣押和虐待囚犯，那么它所鼓吹的理想会继续在全世界其他人的耳朵里听来如同极度的伪善。	But as long as it continues to hold and abuse prisoners without giving them a fair trial, America’s professed ideals will continue to sound to the rest of the world like the deepest hypocrisy.
与常见的误解不同，德国总理默克尔今年之所以让一百万左右的难民进入德国，不是基于人口因素上的自利行为，而是基于道德价值。	Contrary to common misperceptions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel acted on the basis of moral values, not demographic self-interest, in letting in about one million refugees this year.
如果增长和就业预期继续萎靡，就很难重振需求，特别是私人商业投资，不管利率多么低，也不管银行拥有多么大的潜在贷款资源。	If growth and employment expectations remain dismal, it will be difficult to rekindle demand, particularly private business investment, no matter how low interest rates are, or how many resources banks have for potential lending.
而剩下的2万当量吨缺口就由所谓的“二次铀资源”来满足 — — 主要是一些公营机构和政府的库存，再加工的核燃料以及贫化铀储藏。	The remaining 20,000 tons came from so-called secondary uranium sources – mainly inventories held by utilities and governments, re-processed nuclear fuel, and stockpiles of depleted uranium.
如果投资者涌向“安全”的美国金融资产，这些资本流必然会让美元大幅升值，这毫无疑问是一种成本，特别是在满是闲置资源和闲置产能的时期。	If investors flock to “safe” US financial assets, these capital flows must keep the dollar significantly stronger that it would be otherwise, which is an unambiguous cost, especially at a time of idle resources and unutilized capacity.
莫斯科的基础设施可谓处于历史上最好的时期：该市地铁系统运转优良，并且最近又有所扩建，机场现代化、干净又高效。	Moscow’s infrastructure has never looked better: the city boasts a well-functioning and recently expanded metro system and modern, clean, and efficient airports.
首先，与全球其他地区的最佳实践一样，中国政府需要对其政策目标进行更明确的（即透明）优先排序，或排名。	First, in keeping with global best practice, Chinese authorities need to be far more explicit (that is, transparent) in prioritizing, or ranking, their policy objectives.
但是，在该地区的其他国家，领导人马上开始为俄罗斯入侵和吞并克里米亚开脱，或指出俄罗斯太强大，无法应对。	But, elsewhere in the region, leaders were quick to excuse Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea, or to argue that Russia is simply too powerful to confront.
当我们召开现场会议时，我们可以倾听肢体语言，而不仅仅是说出来的话，我们可以选择看哪里，而不仅仅是通过视频中的特殊角度。	When we attend a meeting in person, we can listen to the body language, not just the spoken word, and we can choose where to look, not just the particular angle that the video screen shows.
在中国开始反思执政的共产党对经济命脉的控制之前，它都将是回荡在整个全球经济头上的市场不确定性的来源。	Until China reckons with the ruling Communist Party’s stranglehold on key levers of the economy, it will be a source of market uncertainty that reverberates throughout the global economy.
尼克松最后大获全胜，但伯恩斯的政策导致了20世纪70年代的世界性通胀，也让战后固定汇率体系走向崩溃。	Nixon won resoundingly, but Burns’ policies helped set off the worldwide inflation of the 1970s and brought forward the breakup of the post-war system of fixed exchange rates.
婴儿潮时代出生的人可能是最能体会这一点的了，因为他们在孩提时代经历了摇滚乐，也在他们为人父母时又经历了谷歌。	Baby boomers might be the best placed to appreciate this, since they experienced Rock 'n’ Roll as kids and Google as parents.
战争特有的性质就是伤害无辜平民，针对恐怖分子的战争这一特性表现的更加突出，因为恐怖分子常常行踪诡秘。	By its very nature, war creates innocent victims, and this even more likely when it is waged against terrorists, because terrorists tend to keep their whereabouts hidden.
如果伦齐的公投失败，五星运动领导人贝佩·格里洛（Beppe Grillo）已经表示他将要求举行关于意大利欧元区成员地位的新公决，这场公决很有可能取得成功。	If Renzi’s referendum fails, Five Star Movement leader Beppe Grillo has indicated that he will demand another plebiscite on Italy’s eurozone membership, which might just succeed.
不管我们的节日愿望对于我们的眼前欲望来说有多诱人，但在2018年，投资者的心愿单都必须跟经济和政策的大图景结合起来。	However tempting it may be to focus our holiday wishes on our own immediate desires, it is imperative this year that investors’ wish lists take into account the big economic and policy picture.
此外，因为对渐进步骤审议进展缓慢且明显无法满足需要，叙利亚人正陷入流离失所、惨遭伤害、折磨和大批被杀的困境当中。	Meanwhile, amid plodding deliberations of incremental steps that are clearly inadequate, Syrians are being displaced, wounded, tortured, and killed in droves.
此外，监管者的目标常常是银行高管的激励，却常常对组织的冒险激励视而不见，反而是在事后通过监管要求它们不要冒这些险。	And, while regulators often target bank executives’ incentives, they often leave intact the organization’s incentives to take risks – but then command them, via regulation, not to take those risks.
为了使各国核武器库存量保持透明并在各大强权之间建立信任，也是有必要举行军控谈判，而这也是该谈判有用武之地的地方。	Arms-control talks are mostly needed for rendering national arsenals more transparent, and for building confidence between the great powers. That is all there is to their usefulness.
但巴勒斯坦人必须确保联合国安理会通过这项动议，然后在联合国大会获得三分之二以上多数赞成票，以获得完全的正式认可。	But the Palestinians must secure the approval of the UN Security Council and the support of two-thirds of the UN General Assembly in order to gain full official recognition.
第二，为了懂得如何应对困扰我们的问题包括从恐怖主义到核扩散，重要的是要了解它们是如何以及在何时出现的。	Second, in order to understand how to cope with the problems that plague us – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation – it is sensible to know how and whence they emerged.
事实上，CIA就是为了避免真正的民主监督、为总统提供“合理否认 ” （ plausible deniability）的。	In fact, the CIA was designed to avoid genuine democratic oversight and provide presidents with “plausible deniability.”
2017年的第三项关键性卫生趋势是消灭人类盘尾丝虫病的进程也实现了新的进展，人类盘尾丝虫病会造成失明、视力下降和皮肤感染。	A third key health trend in 2017 was further progress toward the elimination of human onchocerciasis, which causes blindness, impaired vision, and skin infections.
在欧盟各委员会上，以及本月的国际货币基金组织（IMF）华盛顿会议上，意大利财政部长帕多安（Pier Carlo Padoan）提出了比其他欧盟领导人力度更大、协调更好的财政刺激。	In EU councils and again at this month’s International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, DC, Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy’s finance minister, presented the case for fiscal stimulus more strongly and coherently than any other EU leader.
各国政府为实现跨境资本全自由流通选择放松金融管制，就像他们在面对大规模全球金融危机时选择让上述政策基本维持下去。	It was the choice of governments to loosen regulations on finance and aim for full cross-border capital mobility, just as it was a choice to maintain these policies largely intact, despite a massive global financial crisis.
（没错，我看好这个趋势：我投资了其中的一间叫LendAround的公司，并考虑对其他两间进行投资。 ）	(Yes, I am betting on this trend: I am an investor in one, LendAround, and considering an investment in the other two.)
佛蒙特州参议员、民主党初选竞争者伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）在反对12个国家的跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）时指出，这样的协议主要是为了跨国大公司的利益。	As Vermont Senator and Democratic primary contender Bernie Sanders pointed out when he opposed the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), such deals tend mainly to protect large multinational corporations’ interests.
因此，爱尔兰和捷克共和国在《条约》批准危机里的连锁反应已经很明显了，并且这有可能会在2009年渗透到欧洲的更大范围。	So the inter-linkage between the ratification crises in Ireland and the Czech Republic is now explicit and threatens to spill over into the wider EU arena in 2009.
也许个别风险与20世纪50年代不是一个量级，但现在的个别风险数量更多，并且时常是在一个通胀程度远远更大的起点起步的。	Maybe the individual risks aren’t of the same order of magnitude as in the 1950s, but there are more of them, and markets are starting from a much more inflated position.
因此，后危机时代的全球经济主要引擎将会减速，这将对过去十年最积极的经济趋势 — — 发达国家和发展中国家人均收入水平的趋同 — — 造成严重影响。	The main engine of the post-crisis global economy is therefore slowing, which has serious implications for one of the last decade’s most positive economic trends: the convergence of developed and developing countries’ per capita income levels.
此外，在平等性和经济增长之间存在现实权衡问题，平均主义即使对许多低收入的人来说也不是值得支持的政策。	Moreover, there is a real tradeoff between equality and economic growth, and egalitarianism is not a popular policy even for many low-income people.
跟金融业只占GDP一小部分的美国不同，由于银行业持续紧缩，英国经济的产出仍然未能从2008年后大萧条的损失中恢复过来。	Unlike the United States, where the financial sector is smaller as a share of GDP, the UK economy has still not recovered the output lost in the post-2008 Great Recession, owing to continued retrenchment in the banking sector.
因为“以眼还眼”在战争中永远不会发挥作用，报复之后是反报复，会使我们陷入中东那样的血腥循环而无力自拔。	Because an “eye for an eye” can never work when communities are in conflict – reprisal leads to a counter-reprisal in the sort of blood spiral we are seeing in the Middle East.
毛里求斯选择了一条走向高社会凝聚力，高福利和高速发展的道路 — — 同时也将社会不平等状况维持在较细微的程度。	Mauritians have chosen a path that leads to higher levels of social cohesion, welfare, and economic growth – and to a lower level of inequality.
就像两百年前的美国革命者一样，印度民族主义者主要为“英国人的权利”而战，他们相信复制议会两院制可以体现并确保这一点。	Like the American revolutionaries two centuries ago, Indian nationalists fought for “the rights of Englishmen,” which they thought the replication of the Houses of Parliament would epitomize and guarantee.
根据经济学家克莉丝汀·罗默（Christina Romer）和戴维·罗默（David Romer）在2003发表的研究，货币政策的质量主要取决于中央银行家是否对政策制定和通货膨胀有明确和细致入微的理解。	According to research published in 2003 by the economists Christina Romer and David Romer, the quality of monetary policy depends critically on whether central bankers have a clear and nuanced understanding of policy making and inflation.
根据世贸组织2012年的一份研究，阿根廷、巴西、印度和俄罗斯对进口药品的关税税率大约在10 % ， 而阿尔及利亚和卢旺达等国家为15 % 。	According to a 2012 study by the World Trade Organization, Argentina, Brazil, India, and Russia impose tariffs of around 10% on imported medicines, while Algeria and Rwanda, for example, maintain a 15% rate.
2012年6月，穆尔西击以52%对48%的优势败对手、穆巴拉克的最后一任总理沙菲克（Ahmed Shafik）赢得总统选举。	In June 2012, Morsi defeated his rival Ahmed Shafik, Mubarak’s final prime minister, by a margin of 52-48% to win the presidency.
但随着媒体风暴的蔓延，凯利改变了态度并指示白宫工作人员为其撒谎 — — 宣称他在获知波特前妻的消息时迅速采取了制止性的对策。	But, as the media firestorm spread, Kelly changed his story and directed the White House staff to lie on his behalf – to assert that he had responded swiftly and negatively to the news about Porter’s former wives.
值得注意的是，一国债务管理实践的质量与其债务困境风险之间存在强烈的负相关关系，90%的低风险国家都表现出良好的实践水平。	It is worth noting the strong negative correlation between the quality of a country’s debt-management practices and its risk of debt distress, with 90% of low-risk countries demonstrating good practices.
政客一方面不愿为国内计划提供资金，一方面又在大打“漫长的战争 ” ， 美国外交圈可能会忽视两者之间的联系，但其他美国人可不会。	The linkage between politicians’ unwillingness to fund domestic programs and the imperiled commitment to “the long war” might elude those in US foreign-policy circles, but it is not lost on the rest of the country.
《自然》杂志的一篇全面研究表明，自1982年以来，各种类型的干旱 — — 从“异常干燥”到“反常干旱 ” — —的发生率略有下降。	A comprehensive study in the journal Nature demonstrates that, since 1982, incidents of all categories of drought, from “abnormally dry” to “exceptional drought,” have decreased slightly.
同样，马克里的胜利可以赋予委内瑞拉选民 — — 定于12月6日进行投票 — — 反对本国日益独裁政府所必需的��气。	Likewise, Macri’s victory could give voters in Venezuela – headed to the polls on December 6 – the courage they need to cast their ballots against their increasingly authoritarian government.
除了实行残酷的政策外，这样的做法还可能鼓励中俄等国政府，因为这样做能使它们看起来行事合理乃至非常可靠。	Beyond the cruel policies that it enables, it risks emboldening governments like those in China and Russia, as it makes them seem reasonable, even reliable.
这部分是因为FDIC需要在金融部门企业倒闭时收拾残局，因此其高级官员有强烈的激励通过防止风险失控保护保险资金。	In part, this is because the FDIC is responsible for cleaning up the mess when financial-sector firms fail, so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect its insurance fund by preventing risks from getting out of control.
虽然有些欧洲国家较好地维护了欧美协商及承诺机制，但欧洲领导人对战后安全结构的动摇已经表现出越来越明确的关注。	Though several European countries have done relatively well in terms of maintaining consultations and commitments with the US, Europe’s leaders have watched with growing concern as the postwar security structure has faltered.
但在（比如）公共部门岗位上增加支出只能带来暂时的收益；从长期看，这类支出将削弱工作激励，阻碍公司投资 — — 现在已经出现下降趋势。	But spending more on, say, public-sector jobs would bring only temporary benefits; in the long term, such spending would weaken work incentives and undermine corporate investment, which is already on the decline.
在大部分国家，公债占GDP比例自2004年以来从未超过60 % — —与2004年前成为欧盟成员的15个国家中的许多国家形成了鲜明对比。	In most countries, public debt as a share of GDP has not exceeded 60% since 2004 – in stark contrast to many of the 15 countries that were members of the European Union prior to that year.
但无论这些努力究竟会取得何种成功，它们必将提升 — — 而不是减弱 — — 现有双边关系的重要性，比如美日同盟。	But, however successful such efforts may be, they will enhance, not lessen, the importance of existing bilateral relationships, such as the Japan-US alliance.
自1917年十月革命以来，所有共产主义政权都用“统一战线”来扩大党在国内和国外的权力，形式或隐晦或张扬，但卑劣则一。	Every Communist regime since the Russian Revolution of 1917 has sought to use the “united front” to extend the power of the party, both at home and abroad, in ways that may be subtle or overt, but are invariably underhanded.
在当下，投资者对安全的偏好使得增加政府债务的成本不同寻常地低，而产出和���业持续低于正常水平所造成的长期前景阴影会使目前陷入停顿的复苏变得代价高昂。	Right now, investors’ preference for safety makes financing additional government debt abnormally cheap, while the long-run shadows cast by prolonged subnormal production and employment make the current sluggish recovery predictably costly.
事实上，在浮动汇率下，一国可以使用以精心选择的通胀目标为指导独立的货币政策抵消邻国货币扩张的衰退影响。	The fact is that, with a flexible exchange rate, a country can offset the recessionary impact of a neighboring country’s monetary easing using its own independent monetary policy, guided by carefully chosen inflation targets.
但这并不意味着克林顿的说法如一些媒体事实考据机构（包括获得普利策奖的PolitiFact）所言只是“半对 ” 。	But that doesn’t mean that Clinton’s claim is only “half true,” as asserted by some media fact-checkers (including the Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact).
保罗讲人体（拉丁语称为corpus）比喻为社会，指出健康的社会正如健康的人体，每个器官都必须得到保护，不能让任何一个死去。	Paul used the human body (corpus in Latin) as a metaphor for society, suggesting that in a healthy society, as in a healthy body, every organ must be preserved and none permitted to die.
在世界领导人齐聚第22界联合国气候变化框架会议、让巴黎协定真正生效之际，他们应该批判地质工程的速效药 — — 并表现出致力于真正的解决方案的决心。	As world leaders convene for the 22nd United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to bring the Paris agreement into force, they should repudiate geo-engineering quick fixes – and demonstrate a commitment to real solutions.
在中国入侵印度的整个过程中，国际关注点一直都放在有可能爆发的美苏核决战上，而不是喜马拉雅山山脚下的血腥鏖战。	Throughout the invasion, the international spotlight was on the potential US-Soviet nuclear showdown, not on the bloody war raging in the Himalayan foothills.
首先，在许多关键国家，加剧的不平等性和社会分化使政府（特别是民主国家政府）难以做出艰难决策，合作之势日渐减弱。	For starters, national politics in key countries is largely moving away from cooperation, with rising inequality and social fragmentation making it difficult for governments, especially in democracies, to make tough decisions.
俄国需要美国和西方的协助，才能实现建立国际铀浓缩中心的宏伟理想。 俄国也离不开消费俄天然气和石油资源的西方市场。	Russia needs America and the West in order to realize its ambitious initiative to establish international centers of uranium enrichment, and it needs Western markets, which are the largest consumers of Russia’s gas and oil.
与那些反对言论恰恰相反，查戈斯人迁回外岛对美国的安全利益根本没有威胁，因为外岛和美军基地之间相距数百里之遥。	Despite claims to the contrary, there is no possible threat to US interests from the islanders’ return to the outer islands, hundreds of kilometers away from Diego Garcia.
八百年前的这个月，这片草地色彩斑斓，遍布着男爵和骑士的帐篷，更有规模更大的英格兰约翰王（King John）的王帐，看上去像是飘荡着王旗的马戏团。	Eight hundred years ago this month, it offered a colorful spectacle, dotted with the tents of barons and knights, and the larger pavilion of King John of England, looking like a circus top with the royal standard fluttering above.
第三项任务是关注实体经济活动，终止衰退，维持增长，最重要的是还要改革资本主义制度以降低其对金融的依赖。	The third task is to focus on real economic activity, end the recession, sustain growth, and, above all, reform the capitalist system to make it be less dependent on finance.
一些气象学家认为400 ppm的大气二氧化碳浓度已经超过了气候灾难触发点，数十亿人有成为难民的危险。	Some climate scientists believe that 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is already enough to take us past the tipping point at which we risk a climate catastrophe that will turn billions of people into refugees.
但如果那些改革中的国家面对经济停滞或者需求下降这类负面区域环境的话，宏观经济以及金融方面的独立性就将反过来阻碍改革的成功。	But macroeconomic and financial interdependence may render success elusive if reforming countries face an adverse regional environment of stagnating or falling demand.
每年都有2.8亿吨塑料被生产出来，其中有大量塑料进入了地下水、河流和海洋 — — 并在食物链中累积。	Every year, more than 280 million tons of plastic is produced, with vast quantities making their way into groundwater, rivers, and oceans – and onward up the food chain.
在其对2011—2012年就业和竞争力委员会（Council on Jobs and Competitiveness）的敦促中，他签署了数项行政令以动员和加速高优先级联邦基础设施项目的跨部门审查和批准程序。	At the urging of his 2011-2012 Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, he signed several executive orders to modernize and expedite the interagency review-and-permitting processes for high-priority federal infrastructure projects.
内部贬值的通紧效应因规则而加剧，在2012年的“财政契约”中被强化，该契约要求欧元区国家对自己的债务负全部责任，因此必须采取严格的预算纪律。	The deflationary impact of internal devaluation is compounded by the rule, reinforced in the 2012 “fiscal compact,” that eurozone countries are wholly responsible for their own debts and thus must adopt strict budgetary discipline.
中国有些为了重新分配能源负荷的措施 — — 例如太阳能和风能 — — 得到了保留，但是，扩大这些能源措施的资金主要要依靠地方官员，而这些官员是不会愿意为此而强迫当地的工厂中断生产和解雇更多的工人的。	But the funding for expanding these efforts will rest largely on provincial officials, who will be reluctant to compel local cadres to disrupt production and lay off even more workers.
各大汽车制造商已经宣布了数十种电动车模块方案，多个欧洲国家的政界人士已经制定了汽油和柴油车的报废期限，而印度和中国的领导人也有志于此。	Car manufacturers have announced plans for scores of electric models, and politicians in several European countries have put an expiry date on gasoline and diesel cars, with leaders in India and China aspiring to do the same.
该委员会有 24 个国家，大国独立拥有席位，小国则组成一些团体，由其中的一些来代表大伙儿，这种团体被称为“选区 ” 。	Twenty-four countries sit there. Big ones have their own seats, while smaller ones represent groups of countries, known as “constituencies.”
接着，它遭遇了一系列金融冲击，2008年全球金融危机为其高潮，它触发了一连串经济失灵，让世界几乎跌入灾难性的多年萧条。	Then it was shaken by a series of financial shocks that culminated in the 2008 global financial crisis, which triggered cascading economic failures that pushed the world to the edge of a devastating multi-year depression.
这个问题便是选民教育程度不够，容易操纵。 学校公民教育的衰败、地方报纸的倒闭 — — 以及由此导致的公众对问题和政治程序的理解力的下降 — — 共同形成了传播伪信息的温床。	The erosion of civics education in schools, the shuttering of local newspapers – and the consequent decline in the public’s understanding of issues and the political process – conspire to create fertile ground for the sowing of disinformation.
伯南克与在2006年接管美联储，他1999年在同一会议上发表了一篇精彩论文，从而开始了他的决策事业。	Bernanke, who took over at the Fed in 2006, launched his policy career in 1999 with a brilliant paper presented to the same Jackson Hole conference.
找出影响国家和地区的特定障碍有助于制定有效的解决方案 — — 尤其因为某些障碍（如对网络缺乏认识）比基础设施等其他障碍解决起来成本低得多。	Identifying the particular barriers affecting a country or region enables the development of effective solutions – not least because some barriers, such as awareness, are far cheaper to tackle than others, like infrastructure.
联合国儿童基金会估计，在九个国家 — — 尼日尔、中非共和国、乍得、孟加拉国、马里、几内亚、南苏丹、布基纳法索和马拉维 — — 童婚率高于50 % 。	In nine countries – Niger, Central African Republic, Chad, Bangladesh, Mali, Guinea, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, and Malawi – UNICEF estimates that child marriage rates are higher than 50%.
具有讽刺意味的是，虽然特朗普声称要维护美国产业工人的利益，但一系列“成功”谈判 — — 这将促使中国进一步开放其保险和其他金融活动市场 — — 的真正受益者很可能就是华尔街。	Ironically, while Trump claims to be looking out for US industrial workers, the real winner from “successful” negotiations – which would spur China to open its markets further to insurance and other financial activities – is likely to be Wall Street.
因此，美国在中东的疏远盟友 — — 沙特阿拉伯、埃及和以色列 — — 的上策是不再反对伊朗核协议，转而鼓励特朗普保证核协议的实施。	Given this, America’s estranged allies in the Middle East – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel – would be well advised to drop their opposition to the Iran deal, and instead encourage Trump to keep it in place.
此外，短期和长期失业率都低估了衰退开始以来劳动力参与率（LFPR）的剧烈而持久的下降对劳动力市场的冲击。	Moreover, both the short-term and long-term unemployment rates underestimate the slack in the labor market caused by the significant and sustained decline in the labor-force participation rate (LFPR) since the recession began.
这突显出巴黎协定所表现的全球治理新模式的最后一个关键特征：本月初所达成的这一协定，以及巴黎大会本身，不仅仅面向政府。	This highlights the final crucial feature of the new global governance model exemplified by the Paris agreement: The deal reached earlier this month, like the Conference of the Parties itself, is not only for governments.
日本政府债（JGBs）总欠债额近乎达到不可思议的9万亿美元，仅略低于欧元区17国欠债总额的10.5万亿美元，而后者的人口数量达到前者的三倍。	The total outstanding volume of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) is an almost unfathomable $9 trillion, only just below the $10.5 trillion in outstanding debt for the full 17-country eurozone, which has more than triple the population.
上个月的最新评估表明，增加缓冲在瑞典、挪威、冰岛、捷克和斯洛伐克大量存在，以应对这些国家具体的信用条件。	The most recent review, last month, showed that additional buffers are in force in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, in response to the particular credit conditions in those countries.
正如勃列日涅夫所说，贝阿铁路是“世纪建设项目 ” ， 推进，切割和贯穿了数千英里的河流，森林和通常在永冻土之覆盖下的悬崖峭壁。	As Brezhnev put it, the BAM was “the construction project of the century,” pushing, cutting, and tunneling its way through thousands of miles of rivers, forests, and cliffs usually covered in permafrost.
而坏消息则是，即便在如此祥和的环境下，美国作为世界唯一的超级大国，也不会放弃其“随心所欲”的政策或忘记自身的实力，令其他国家唯其马首是瞻。	The bad news is that, even under such auspicious conditions, the US, as a world power, will not relinquish its “free-hand” policy or forget its strength and its claim to preeminence among nations.
仿佛实现上述目标并非已然是痴人说梦，梅还坚持要求把外国学生也划成移民，尽管他们仅在求学期间留居英国。	As if achieving that goal were not already impossible, May insists on counting foreign students as migrants, even though they are in the UK only for the duration of their studies.
在莱恩哈特和罗格夫的研究中，他们观察到高度债务国家经济增长得比较缓慢，即使这是真的，也不能告诉我们高负债会降低还��促进增长。	In the case of Reinhart and Rogoff, the observation that highly indebted countries grow more slowly, even if true, does not tell us anything about whether high debt causes slow growth or vice versa.
但纵使造就了这一幕出租车工会，乘客与优步司机的悲喜剧，法国也逐渐开始注重培育小型高成长性的科技公司。	But, while this is a triumph for taxi unions and a tragedy for passengers and Uber drivers, France has also started focusing on nurturing small, high-potential technology companies.
并且，为了使我们能够充分享受自由 — — 无论是信仰自由还是科学研究自由 — — 国家都必须重申它的教廷本质。	And, in order to enable the full enjoyment of our freedoms – be they of worship or scientific research – the state must reassert its secular nature.
它们尤其应该号召美国承担全球责任，用奥巴马描述对叙利亚的干涉的话说 ， “ 创造让他人崛起的条件和联盟 ” 。	They should specifically call on the US to assume the mantle of global responsibility and, in the phrase that Obama used to describe the intervention in Libya, “create the conditions and coalitions for others to step up.”
他们也许能免于如罗斯的小说所描绘的那样陷入不得不在两个同样糟糕的命运中做出选择的困境：要么成为受害者温切尔（Winchell ） ， 要么成为心甘情愿当人质的本吉尔斯多夫（Bengelsdorf ） 。	And may they be spared the dilemma, depicted in Roth’s novel, of having to choose between two equally dreadful fates: that of the victim, Winchell, or the willing hostage, Bengelsdorf.
自从1948年在朝鲜半岛出现两个独立的政权和政治制度以来，韩国和美国（韩国唯一的防卫同盟国）只应对过两位朝鲜“最高领导人 ” — —金日成和金正日。	Since the emergence of two separate regimes and systems on the Korean Peninsula in 1948, South Korea and the US (its only defense ally) have dealt with only two “supreme leaders,” Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.
这对印度尼西亚尤为重要，因为它要偿还1320亿美元的债务（其中700亿美元的债主是公众债券人或有政府机构的担保 ） 。	This is especially important for Indonesia, which must service a debt of $132 billion (of which $70 billion is owed to public creditors or guaranteed by government agencies).
随着全球可贸易部分（可以在甲国生产但在乙国消费的商品和服务）的扩张，经济活动和就业岗位的战场也扩大了。	As the tradable part of the global economy (goods and services that can be produced in one country and consumed in another) expands, competition for economic activity and jobs broadens.
如果说沙贾汗皇帝 — — 据说这人想“在印度的地界里消灭所有印度教徒 ” — —是印度历史的一部分，对此桑姆则宣称“我们将修改这个历史 ” 。	If people like Shah Jahan – who supposedly wanted to “wipe out all Hindus from India” – were part of India’s history, Som said, “we will change this history.”
如果公共去杠杆化并不是一个完整的增长政策 — — 事实上确实不是 — — 那为什么人们这么关注财政紧缩而不去切实促进（而不只是口头上说说）增长和就业呢？	If public-sector deleveraging is not a complete growth policy – and it isn’t – why is there so much attention on fiscal austerity and so little action (as opposed to lip service) on growth and employment?
正像贝南克所指出的那样，1933年45%的美国农场主都拖欠按揭还款，而1934年，住宅按揭的拖欠比率在半数以上的美国城市超过了38 % 。	As Bernanke pointed out, 45% of US farms were behind on mortgage payments in 1933, and in 1934, default rates on home mortgages exceeded 38% in half of US cities.
从他们的角度看来，尽管欧元区的通胀率过低，但资产购买行为从来都不应该发生，而且早在很久以前就该提高利率了。	From their perspective, asset purchases never should have happened, and interest rates should have been raised long ago, despite the eurozone’s too-low rate of inflation.
担心欧洲央行采取无限制动作的货币鹰派 — — 德国央行和其他核心国央行 — — 成功地给从债券购买计划中受益的国家施加了严格而有效的条件。	Monetary hawks – the Bundesbank and several other core central banks – who were worried about a new open-ended ECB mandate pushed successfully for strict and effective conditionality for countries benefiting from the bond purchases.
但有强烈的证据表明奥斯本所做的削减支出措施剥夺了一个已经饱受总需求不足困扰的经济体的支出能力，从而阻碍了复苏。	But there is a strong case to be made that the cuts that Osborne did make impeded recovery, by removing spending power from an economy already suffering from a deficiency of aggregate demand.
但深刻而持续的危机暴露了欧元基础的脆弱性，并应引起警惕，当前技术层面的权宜之计也许不能抵御另一场冲击。	But the depth and persistence of the ongoing crisis have exposed the euro’s fundamental fragilities, and should serve as a warning that today’s technocratic Band-Aids may not hold in the face of another shock.
但是，伊朗一跃成为第九个核子国家将会促发地区和全球动荡，危险地加剧恐惧和怀疑，并且让国际社会面对一场深刻的事关大局观和政策的危机。 这也是毫无疑问的。	But it is also true that Iran’s emergence as the ninth nuclear power would provoke a regional and global upheaval, dangerously aggravate fears and suspicions, and confront the international community with a profound crisis of vision and policy.
阿斯塔纳俱乐部的讨论既是追求地位（status-seeking）的公关活动，也提供公共品，这一组合也是哈萨克斯坦外交政策的长期特征。	This combination of status-seeking public relations and the provision of public goods that characterizes the Astana Club discussions has long been a feature of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy.
全球经济的两大构造变迁 — — GDP增长放缓和新兴市场竞争加剧 — — 形成了一条贯穿欧洲的断层线。	The two tectonic shifts in the global economy – slower GDP growth and increased emerging-market competition – have created a fault line that runs through Europe.
过去十年来，温室气体的排放速度已经加快，过去一年大气中二氧化碳浓度的增速比20世纪90年代高出15 % ， 达到近三十年来的顶点。	Over the last decade, greenhouse-gas emissions have accelerated, and the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased in the past year at the fastest rate in nearly three decades, reaching a level that is 15% higher than in 1990.
我最近和蒂姆·戴森（Tim Dyson ） 、 里拉·维萨里阿（Leela Visaria）以及其他一些人在合作搞一个研究，其中的结论是，即使我们乐观地假设印度可以解决人口增长问题，印度仍然面临一连串的主要困难。	I recently co-authored a study (with Tim Dyson, Leela Visaria and others) that concludes, with modest optimism, that while India can manage its population growth, it also faces a number of major difficulties.
是的，占星依然在报纸上流行，但它们仅作为严肃科学挑战的标靶或是娱乐；认为星座决定我们的命运的观念已经失去了所有的智力市场。	Yes, horoscopes still persist in popular newspapers, but they are there only for the severely scientifically challenged, or for entertainment; the idea that the stars determine our fate has lost all intellectual currency.
在10月5日的首轮投票后，两位女性之间的斗争看起来已是不可避免，因为民调显示两人都不太可能获得50%的选票。	A run-off between the two women, following the October 5th first round, seems inevitable, as opinion polls give neither close to 50% of the vote.
随着我们衡量事物和发现变化影响能力的提高 — — 简言之，随着我们实证研究能力的提高 — — 我们需要思考哪些责任是我们的研究成果需要承担的。	(Global warming, anyone?) As our ability to measure things and detect the impact of any change improves – in short, as we get better at empirical research – we need to consider what kind of responsibility is entailed by the knowledge that we gain.
发自罗马 — — 在南斯拉夫解体以及阿尔巴尼亚共产政权倒台整整20年后，西巴尔干地区又走到了另一个历史转折点上。	ROME – Twenty years after the collapse of Yugoslavia and the communist regime in Albania, the western Balkans region is at a turning point once again.
今年2月5日，道琼斯工业平均指数下跌了4.6 % ， 这个跌幅远小于1987年10月19日22.6%的跌幅纪录。	On February 5 of this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.6%, far below the record 22.6% decline on October 19, 1987.
在2010年举行的匈牙利议会选举中，欧尔班的青年民主主义者联盟党（简称民盟）赢得了53%的选票以及国民议会386席位中的263个。	In Hungary’s 2010 parliamentary election, Orbán’s Fidesz party won 53% of the vote, and 263 of the National Assembly’s 386 seats.
就像协议在前言部分所表述的那样，协议的签署来源于埃及总统阿巴德·法塔赫·塞西对结束巴勒斯坦人分歧的“坚持 ” ， “目标是沿1967年之前的边界实现独立建国 ” 。	As the agreement stated in its opening, it stemmed from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s “insistence” on ending the divisions among Palestinians, “with the aim of creating an independent state” along pre-1967 borders.
3月，他打断了时任国家安全顾问麦克马斯特与韩国代表团的一次会面，就是为了突然宣布他很乐意会见金正恩。	In March, he interrupted a meeting between his then-National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster and a South Korean delegation to reveal, out of the blue, that he would gladly meet with Kim.
如果两国能够找到办法阻止小纠纷升级，就能营造出更有利的氛围解决最大的冲突源泉 — — 克什米尔问题。	And if the two countries can find ways to prevent smaller disputes from escalating, it would generate a more conducive atmosphere in which to address Kashmir, the largest source of conflict of all.
这些其他因素结合起来围绕着中央银行的声明和决定创造了一个光鲜明亮的肥皂泡，显而易见地夸大了他们在经济上的重要性。	These other factors have combined to create a bubble around central-bank pronouncements and decisions that grossly exaggerates their economic significance.
在欧洲其他国家都出现增长的情况下，各国政府都似乎对自身经济情况多了点底气，因此也越来越不愿和希腊有所妥协。	With the rest of Europe growing, other governments, believing themselves to be in a stronger economic position, are less inclined to compromise with Greece.
希腊没有什么好选择，但如果想要防止意大利和西班牙财政和增长导向改革受到阻挠，就必须设法解决巨大的传染风险。	Greece has no good options, but a serious contagion risk remains to be contained in order to prevent derailment of the fiscal and growth-oriented reforms in Italy and Spain.
实际上，伊拉克整个就是建立在胜利者正义基础之上。 大英帝国征服了奥托曼帝国后，让逊尼派阿拉伯人在一个居于少数派的国家超负荷。	Indeed, the very foundation of Iraq was based on victors’ justice: the British Empire, having vanquished the Ottomans, made the Sunni Arabs overlords in a country in which they were a minority.
因此，欧盟需要通过行动，而不是语言 — — 许多伊朗人民也如此埋怨西方 — — 向伊朗政府采取强硬立场来向伊朗人民表明自己的决心。	It is critical, therefore, that the EU demonstrate its commitment to the Iranian people through actions, rather than words – a complaint that many Iranians level against Western powers – by taking a tougher stance against the regime.
从这方面看，他的家具制造商和出口商背景十分有利，这能给他带来此前几任印尼总统所欠缺的实践知识和经验。	In this regard, his background as a furniture manufacturer and exporter is a major asset, enabling him to bring a level of hands-on knowledge and experience that past Indonesian presidents have lacked.
消费者在购买住房和汽车上紧缩开支，不仅仅是因为他们遭受了股票价格的下跌和房屋价值的下降对他们财富的冲击，也因为他们无所适从。	Consumers are pulling back from home and automobile purchases not only because they have suffered a blow to their wealth with declining stock prices and housing values, but also because they don’t know where to turn.
尽管法律上明文禁止，沙特的妇女已经敢于冒天下之大不韪在首都利雅得的街道上开起了车。 同时，一些有名的有识之士在向法德国王和沙特王储阿卜杜拉的公开信中要求进行社会和政治改革。	Despite legal prohibition, Saudi women have defiantly driven their cars in the streets of Riyadh, while prominent intellectuals have published open letters to King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah demanding social and political reform.
事实上，如果一家公司意欲实现对其投资者的委托责任，它就别无选择，必须超越财务回报，考虑可能对其长期表现形成实质影响的ESG因素。	In fact, if a company is to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility to its investors, it has little choice but to go beyond financial returns to incorporate ESG factors that are likely to have a material impact on its performance over time.
1991年，拉宾 — — 前以色列国防军总参谋长、总理、国防部长，时任以色列立法会外交和国防委员会委员 — — 提出了全面的地区和平措施。	In 1991 Yitzhak Rabin – a former IDF chief of staff, prime minister, and defense minister who at the time served on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of the Knesset, Israel’s legislature – argued for a comprehensive regional peace effort.
通讯、交通、银行、保险、能源、教育及卫生等服务领域是发展的主要动力，而旅游业和建筑业目前具有最高的增长潜力。	Service industries such as communications, transportation, banking, insurance, energy, education, and health are key drivers of development, while both tourism and construction currently have high growth potential.
在美国保守派媒体长期宣扬种族影射的情况下，共和党的高谈阔论早在身为媒体从业者的候选人特朗普出现之前就已经没人相信了。	With US conservative media putting out a steady stream of racial innuendo, the GOP’s discourse was thoroughly debased well before candidate Trump, himself a media player, came along.
因此，在全球经济回复常态以及资本避难需求减少的情况下，美国政府债券的价格就会下滑，而该债案的收益率就会上升。	So it is very likely that when the global economy has returned to a sort of normality and safe-haven demand has declined, the prices of US government securities will fall and their yields will rise.
》 《 国家 》 （ The Nation）想知道 ， 《 当气候变化正在重造地球生命的时候，你如何决定要孩子？	The Nation magazine wants to know, “How Do You Decide to Have a Baby When Climate Change Is Remaking Life on Earth?”
另一方面，国际社会对巴基斯坦的核武器持容忍态度，但并未正式接受；而朝鲜的事实核武化则被视为是不可容忍的；伊朗的核计划则在核武器研发之前就被遏制了。	Pakistan’s nuclear weapons, on the other hand, are tolerated but not accepted; North Korea’s de facto nuclearization is considered intolerable; and Iran’s nuclear program was curbed before a weapon could be developed.
直到20世纪70年代，人们还普遍认为尽管两国同样面临极端贫困、经济落后和疾病的挑战，但印度的模式要好于中国，因为它的民众可以自由选择统治者。	Until the 1970s, it was widely argued that, while both countries suffered from extreme poverty, underdevelopment, and disease, India’s model was superior, because its people were free to choose their own rulers.
大型储备货币央行，如美联储的货币政策可能产生巨大的溢出效应，自我毁灭式的汇率政策或跨境金融流管制亦然。	The monetary policies of large reserve-currency central banks such as the United States Federal Reserve can have far-reaching spillover effects, as can self-destructive exchange-rate policies or regulations on cross-border financial flows.
在我的案例中，对我的主要控诉可谓无中生有：我没有发表过任何有关反同性恋的评论，也没有越权将同性恋引入辩论。	In my case, the main charge against me was invented: I made no homophobic statement. Nor did I did introduce the issue of homosexuality into the debate over my appointment.
第一次海湾战争（1990-1991）把来自35个国家的近100万外国士兵带到了阿拉伯半岛，随之而来的还有他们先进的武器系统、通讯传动装置和不同的生活方式。	The first Gulf War (1990-91), brought nearly one million foreign fighters from 35 countries to the Arabian Peninsula, along with their modern weapons systems, communications gear, and different lifestyles.
目前的局势却有点不同：双方存在着根本的分歧。 以色列最担心的是奥巴马会改变美国和这个犹太人国家的特殊关系。	But, however fundamental the current differences might be, it is the underlying suspicion that Obama is poised to shift America away from its unique relationship with the Jewish state that most worries Israelis.
但只有为数不多的经济体准备好去实施那种可以确保可持续高增长率以及切实减少失业率 — — 对年轻人以及就业持续时间来说已经处于警报水平 — — 的内部改革。	But few of these economies are prepared to embark on the type of internal reforms that promise sustained high growth rates and a substantial reduction in unemployment, which has been at alarming levels for young people and in terms of duration.
每个议员代表一个特定的城镇，郊区或乡村地区，大多数人每周都会回去听取选民反馈并举办选区一对一见面会。	Each MP represents a particular town, suburb, or stretch of countryside, and most go back each week to listen to voters and hold sessions known as constituency surgeries.
此外，金融市场在很大程度上认定量化宽松已经是板上钉钉的事情，以至于其中绝大多数的债券利率和汇率都已经提前出现了变动。	Moreover, financial markets consider QE so likely that the largest part of its bond-rate and exchange-rate consequences have already been priced in.
马克思将一切社会矛盾都处理为阶级斗争，而阶级斗争会随着私有财产的消失而消失，因此，共产主义成立后不可能再有异见。	Because Marxism treats all contradictions in society as the products of a class struggle that will disappear when private property does, dissent after the establishment of communism is impossible.
这种页面视窗格式就是知名的窗像单点界面，即WIMP，该界面因为垄断力量，从20世纪80年代起 — — 在电脑的年代中属于久远的历史时代了，就成为通用的范式。	This page-window format is known as Window-Icon-Mouse-Pointer, or WIMP, which, due to monopoly forces, has been the universal paradigm since the 1980’s – ancient history in computer years.
据估计，研究成本大约在每年1亿美元 — — 这是个相当大的数字，但考虑到挑战和复杂性和巨大的规模，并没有不合理之处。	Research costs are estimated at approximately $100 million per year – a substantial sum, but one justified by the complexity and sheer size of the challenge.
对中国经济大规模注入流动性不但催生了大量地产泡沫和过剩产能，也导致负债增加，地方政府和企业负债状况尤为严峻。	The massive injection of liquidity into China’s economy has contributed to rising debt, especially among local governments and firms, while fueling massive real-estate bubbles, and resulting in significant excess capacity.
不仅如此，有效的发展计划需要纳入参与性进程，衡量地区和地方主体的投入，并对全球集体利益始终保持敏感性。	Moreover, effective development planning requires participatory processes that capture inputs from regional and local actors and are sensitive to the collective global good.
但是这次旅程唯一的缺陷是掩盖了一个触目惊心的事实：有关全球经济应该如何运营的“华盛顿共识”已经成为过去。	But what that trip singularly failed to do was paper over a startling fact: the “Washington Consensus” about how the global economy should be run is now a thing of the past.
现在，反对由总理得维尔潘提出的、意在解决居高不下的青年人失业问题的“首次就业合同”法案引发的街头抗议使得世界再一次关注法国。	Now, France has again brought itself to the world’s attention with weeks of street demonstrations against the “contract of first employment” (CFE) proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin to address high youth unemployment.
失业让工人们受害，而用来创造更多就业机会的低利率可能导致更高的通货膨胀；通货膨胀特别会让拥有名义资产的人由于其价值受损而遭受损失。	Unemployment harms workers, while the lower interest rates needed to generate more jobs may lead to higher inflation, which especially harms those with nominal assets whose value is eroded.
如果左翼政党的经济政策被认为只是右翼日程的减弱版抄袭，较贫困人群就会倒向沙文主义力量及其保护他们免受全球化后果的虚假承诺。	If a left party’s economic policy is perceived as a weak copy of the right’s agenda, the poorest segments of the population will gravitate to chauvinist forces and their false promises of protection from the consequences of globalization.
美国关于外交政策的辩论现在已经被谁“更强硬”的表态所主导，而“更强硬”却并不一定意味着“更聪明 ” 。	Foreign-policy debate in the US has become a proxy for who is “tougher,” which does not necessarily mean wiser.
. 对有些年青穆斯林来说，他们占主导地位的亚文化是虚拟的，并且这种亚文化在穆斯林团体的边缘活动，而不管这些穆斯林团体是在欧洲还是在伊斯兰世界。	For some young Muslims, the paramount sub-culture is virtual, and it operates on the fringes of Muslim communities, whether in Europe or in the Islamic world.
的确，有的老牌欧盟国家选择了在过渡期禁止劳动力迁移。 这一过渡期初步设定为两年，并有可能延长到2011年4月。	True, some of the old EU countries have opted for a prohibition of labor migration during a transition period that is initially set at two years and may be extended to April 2011.
印度目前最大的问题是水污染，因为污物直接排放进入运河以及河流，它们的生长速度已经远远超过实际的水污染处理能力。	The biggest problem is water pollution, with discharges into canals and rivers growing faster than treatment capacity.
但是，随着二十世纪的深入，穆斯林改革派逐渐式微，而崛起的是世俗民族主义者，他们强调社会主义作为现代化的方式。	But, as the twentieth century progressed, Muslim reformists lost ground to secular nationalists emphasizing socialism as the path to modernization.
比如，1997—1998年东亚危机期间，当马来西亚央行行长支持采取资本管制时，这项政策遭到了哂笑，但此后前述行长得到了平反。	For example, when Malaysia’s central-bank governor supported the imposition of capital controls during the East Asian crisis of 1997-1998, the policy was scorned, but the former governor has since been vindicated.
博伊尔认为，在现代生物科技中， 从前不进行买卖的东西 — — 曾经被认为不可能商品化的东西 — — 正在被例行公事地私有化。	In modern biotechnology, Boyle thinks, things previously outside the market-once thought to be impossible to commodify-are becoming routinely privatized.
当自由贸易和投资协议如贝尔经济学奖得主约瑟夫•斯蒂格利茨所言更像“企业利益至上的管理贸易制度”时，听取外界看法是尤其重要的。	An outside view is especially important when a free-trade and investment agreement is, as the Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz has noted, more of a “managed trade regime that puts corporate interests first.”
其对东欧的控制总是建立在“友好条约”的基础上，而苏联1956年和1968年分别入侵匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克则是所谓“兄弟般”的使命。	Its control of Eastern Europe was always enforced on the basis of “friendship treaties,” and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were “fraternal” missions.
奥朗德试图将大选变为一场针对萨科齐的全民公决，而失去了民望的后者却想将这场缠斗限定为一场价值观与经验之争。	Hollande wants to turn the presidential election into a referendum on Sarkozy, who, given his unpopularity, is seeking to frame the battle in terms of values and experience.
欧洲是出口导向的中国最大的外部需求源；中国不好，以中国为中心的其他亚洲国家就不会好；而从这里出发，反应环还将延伸到日渐依赖出口的美国经济。	Europe is export-led China’s largest source of external demand; as China goes, so goes the rest of China-centric Asia; and, from there, the ripples reach the shores of an increasingly export-dependent US economy.
同样地，英国保守党领袖卡梅隆所谓从监狱里释放出来的人“最需要的是爱”的说法震动了他的党内更为古派的支持者。	Likewise, the leader of Britain’s Conservatives, David Cameron, startled more old-fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison “need, above all, love.”
确实，如果以色列的“定点清除计划”继续得以实行而巴勒斯坦领导人着手制止抵抗以色列的暴力事件，阿巴斯面对的就是不可能完成的使命。	Indeed, the task that Abbas faces will become impossible if the Israeli policy of “targeted killings” is allowed to continue while Palestinian leaders are working seriously to put an end to acts of violence against Israelis.
但在这个西方国家走向孤立主义的时代 — — 以英国的脱欧公投和美国人选举特朗普为美国总统为标志 — — 区域内的贸易和投资会比以往任何时候都更重要。	But, at a time when Western countries are moving toward isolationism – exemplified by the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the election of Donald Trump as US president – intra-regional trade and investment are more important than ever.
虽然欧洲人也哀叹命运竟然把主宰中东的实权交到了自己鲁莽的美国亲戚手里，但欧洲人在中东其实也成绩斐然，取得的成就也不仅仅是在商业上的，原因很简单，只要中东人知道你不是美国佬就行了。	And, though Europeans have lamented that fate has allocated the real power in the Middle East to their crass cousins, they have nonetheless done pretty well there, not least commercially, simply by not being American.
事实上，与美国相反，欧元区当局在2008年全球金融危机爆发后迟迟没有对银行系统进行整固，也没有切断主权信用和银行资产负债表之间的关联。	Indeed, in contrast to the United States, eurozone authorities were slow to consolidate the banking system after the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, and failed to sever the ties between sovereigns’ and banks’ balance sheets.
针对性更强也更有限的全新美国作用也因此为美国的欧洲伙伴提出了这样的问题：它们能不能没有美国帮助就无法保护自身？	This new, more focused and limited American role thus raises the following question for America’s European partners: Can they afford the luxury of being unable to defend themselves without US help?
金融危机迫使主权国家用其自身信用来取代破产信用，欧洲也不例外，每个国家必须各扫门前雪，这就使人们对欧洲政府债券的可信度产生了怀疑。	The financial crisis forced sovereign states to substitute their own credit for the credit that had collapsed, and in Europe each state had to do so on its own, calling into question the creditworthiness of European government bonds.
智利民主联盟（Concertación ） 、 秘鲁加西亚、巴西卡多佐政府都从布莱尔-克林顿-施罗德日程中汲取了灵感。	The governments of the Concertación in Chile, Alan García in Peru, and Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil all derived inspiration from the Blair-Clinton-Schröder agenda.
不断繁荣的中国不仅增加了从其他国家的进口，而且，尽管近年来石油价格大幅度上升，它还提供了保持西方低物价的产品。	An increasingly prosperous China has not only expanded imports from other countries, but is also providing goods that have kept prices lower in the West, despite sharply higher oil prices in recent years.
要对这套宏大战略进行任何重要的改动，土耳其应该发挥核心作用 — — 政治上、军事上、经济上、以及文化上。	In any serious variation of this Grand Strategy, Turkey will need to play a central role – politically, militarily, economically, and culturally.
虽然俄罗斯前途未谱，但它的历史变得更加清晰，部分原因是因为我们现在知道苏共20大开启了苏联专制的终结。	Although Russia’s future is uncertain, its history is becoming clearer, in part because we now know that the Twentieth Party Congress started the process that brought about the end of Soviet despotism.
随着中国和印度的崛起，以及日本逐渐“正常化 ” ， 它们将会在美国领导的多级体系中相互制衡，保证由美国占据领导地位，其他任何国家都无法成为主导。	As China and India rise, and Japan becomes more “normal,” they will balance each other within the US-led hierarchy to ensure that the US remains on top and one or the other doesn’t dominate.
但不论米洛舍维奇多么罪有应得，只对他一人定罪，而不对其克罗地亚、波斯尼亚和科索沃-阿尔巴尼亚的对手实施同等的处罚，就很难促进后南斯拉夫的各国进行严肃的自省。	But a conviction only of Milosevic, however justified, without parallel penalties for his Croat, Bosniak, and Kosovo-Albanian counterparts would hardly have contributed to serious self-reflection within the post-Yugoslav nations.
在算法时代，政府比以往任何时候都更必须确保能保护弱势群体的声音 — — 即便有时会误判谁才是受害者。	In the age of algorithms, government must, more than ever, ensure the protection of vulnerable voices, even erring on victims’ side at times.
根据这一指数，2012年印度在性别平等排行榜上位居86个国家的第56位，低于巴西、中国、印尼和南非等其他主要新兴市场国家。	According to this metric, in 2012, India ranked 56th out of 86 countries for gender equality, lower than other major emerging markets like Brazil, China, Indonesia, and South Africa.
另一些人 — — 其中最认真的大概是丹尼·罗德里克（Dani Rodrik ） ， 对新兴经济体深感悲观。	Others, perhaps most carefully Dani Rodrik, have developed a version of growth pessimism for the emerging economies.
如果那些5月9日聚集在莫斯科的人们作了任何认可苏联战争罪行的事情，那么他们就是对二战中千百万的无辜亡灵沉默的呼喊声无动于衷。	If those who gather in Moscow on May 9 do anything to validate Soviet war crimes, they will show themselves insensitive to the silent cries of WWII’s tens of millions of dead innocents.
各国政府可以持续尝试说服俄罗斯，使其相信推翻当前政权要比让阿萨德的支持者逐渐陷入极端更有助于实现其利益。	Other governments can continue to try to convince Russia that its interests are better served by getting rid of the current regime than by permitting the continued radicalization of his opponents.
但促进长期投资的政策能够大大有利于克服其中至少四项挑战的措施 — — 高失业、劳动力老龄化、气候变化和基础设施不足。	But efforts to overcome at least four – high unemployment, an aging workforce, climate change, and infrastructure deficiencies – would benefit significantly from policies promoting long-term investments.
但这类协调行动在当前政治环境中十分困难，特别是考虑到政府的关注点日益集中在阿尔及利亚周边安全挑战上时。	But such concerted action will be difficult in the current political environment, especially in view of the government’s increased focus on security challenges in Algeria’s neighborhood.
去年，格鲁吉亚通过和平合法的程序选出Giorgi Margvelashvili为新任总统；今年夏初，格鲁吉亚与欧盟签署了入盟协定，这预示着与西方的联系越来越强。	Last year, Georgia elected its new president, Giorgi Margvelashvili, through a peaceful and legitimate process; earlier this summer, the country signed a European Union Association Agreement, implying closer connections to the West.
哥伦比亚、埃塞俄比亚、马来西亚、尼加拉瓜、巴基斯坦、坦桑尼亚和乌干达等国家极大地降低甚至取消了药品的关税和税收。	Several countries, including Colombia, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda, have substantially reduced or eliminated tariffs and taxes on medicines.
具体来说，第14号可持续发展目标协议要求世界各国领导人结束过度捕捞，杜绝非法捕捞，建立更多的海洋保护区，减少塑料垃圾以及其他海洋污染来源，并增强海洋对酸化现象的抵抗力。	Specifically, SDG 14 commits world leaders to end overfishing, eliminate illegal fishing, establish more marine protected areas, reduce plastic litter and other sources of marine pollution, and increase ocean resilience to acidification.
但民主党筹款势头也将十分强劲，因为像加利福尼亚第45选区这些地方的民主党挑战者将吸引来自全国的资金和志愿者，尤其还有新政治科技的帮助。	But Democratic fundraising will also be strong, and Democratic challengers in places like California’s 45th district will attract money and volunteers from around the country, not least with the help of new political technologies.
悲哀的是，借用诺贝尔经济学奖获得者米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）的话说，这就好比是希望猫能吠一样。	Sadly, to borrow a phrase from the late Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman, that is like wishing that our cats could bark.
特朗普的竞选纲领包括了一些一损俱损的承诺 — — 比如他征收关税的承诺，这进一步表明他未必会认真对待竞选纲领。	That is all the more true when the rhetoric in question includes promises that would harm everyone involved, as Trump’s proposed tariffs would.
苏联人口学家Boris Urlanis所写的一篇名为《照顾好男人》的著名文章在25前出版时候曾引起很大轰动。	The Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis wrote a famous article entitled “Take Care of the Men,” which caused a sensation when it was published around 25 years ago.
然而像那些完全错失了贸易利益的封闭经济体一样，存在重大制度或政治性结构变革障碍的开放型经济体也会表现不佳。	But, like closed economies that miss out on the benefits of trade altogether, open economies with significant institutional or political obstacles to structural change will underperform.
在这一背景下，保持劳动力供给的唯一办法 — — 除了移民之外 — — 是让人们在到达传统退休年龄后继续工作。	Against this background, the only way to sustain the labor supply – aside from immigration – is to keep people in employment beyond the traditional retirement age.
即使金融危机已经摧毁了俄罗斯的股票市场，一些经营管理非常好的俄罗斯公司与它们的西方竞争对手比起来，遭受的冲击要小得多，所以，它们会在明年在全球市场上购买资产。	Even though the financial crisis has wiped out Russian stock market, some of the best-run companies are hit less badly than their Western counterparts and will therefore be shopping in the global market next year.
但是正当我们全力追寻自己的繁荣，财富增长和平等分配的同时，东盟一直展示着它们实现共同繁荣，绝不抛弃任何一个成员的决心。	Nevertheless, ASEAN is constantly demonstrating its determination to create a region where no member is left behind, even as we collectively pursue prosperity and an equitable distribution of our burgeoning wealth.
在长期以来人们一直想当然地认为世俗化会让宗教与政治越离越远的时候，这种新的对宗教的回归并不是法国独有的现象。	This new appeal to religion – after a long period when it was taken for granted that secularization would make religion less and less politically relevant – is not an exclusively French phenomenon.
在这15年中，金融市场变得十分混乱，各种资产和信用泡沫导致了一系列危机，几乎在2008—2009年将世界经济推向万劫不复。	Over the same 15-year period, financial markets have become unhinged, with a profusion of asset and credit bubbles leading to a series of crises that almost pushed the world economy into the abyss in 2008-2009.
首尔 — — 美国总统唐纳德·特朗普对朝鲜最近弹道导弹试验令人惊讶的克制态度已经让许多观察家想知道他的下一步是什么。	SEOUL – US President Donald Trump’s surprisingly restrained reaction to North Korea’s latest ballistic missile test has left many observers wondering what his next move will be.
英国博物学家兼主持人大卫·艾登堡（David Attenborough）这样描述该计划 ： “ 终于，我们有了一个权威、务实而全面的计划，可以阻止正在威胁我们的星球的灾难 。 ”	David Attenborough, the British naturalist and broadcaster, has said of the proposal, “at last, we have an authoritative, practical, and comprehensive plan that could avert the catastrophe that is threatening our planet.”
但他也是个民粹主义者，日渐收紧对国家和媒体的控制，妖魔化一切批评者（包括昔日盟友，比如流亡海外的牧师古兰（Fethullah Gülen ） ） 。	But he is also a populist, who has steadily tightened his grip on the state and the media, demonizing all critics (including former allies such as the expatriate cleric Fethullah Gülen) in the process.
这就是国会同时也在考虑保密情报保护法的原因。 该法将对泄漏机密、特别是事关国家安全的机密的政府官员课以更加严厉的惩罚。	That is why the Diet is also considering a bill on the protection of classified information that would impose harsher punishment on government officials who leak secrets, particularly those concerning national security.
它还寻求防止朝鲜政权倒台并因此引起中朝边境混乱 — — 不但事关难民，还事关韩国和美国军队进入朝鲜的可能。	It also sought to prevent the collapse of the North Korean regime and the resulting potential for chaos on its border – not only flows of refugees, but also the possibility that South Korean or US troops could move into the North.
反对者的诉求是，如果新债券都能（像曾经那样）得到全额偿付，同等的待遇也意味着反对者应该收回所有欠款（不仅包括利息，还有本金 ） 。	The holdouts claimed that, if the new bonds were being serviced in full (as they were), equal treatment required that the holdouts should receive the full amount owed to them (including not only interest but also principal).
正如他的同一时代人熊彼得一样，罗伯森认为这些包含建立新资本和消灭旧资本的泡沫和破灭周期是��进步不可分离的。	Like his contemporary, Schumpeter, Robertson regarded these boom-bust cycles, which involved both the creation of new capital and the destruction of old capital, as inseparable from progress.
试问一个“健全”的欧元区成员国还需要获取什么“临时信贷额度 ” ， 须知这些额度本来就是为那些孕育着潜在风险点的国家准备的啊。	Why, for example, should a “sound” eurozone member state need to obtain a “contingent credit line” unless it is harboring hidden weaknesses?
两者的区别其实归根究底也不大，而且也都不应该掩盖了真正的危机：在一个高公共负债时代下的民主自我治理问题。	The difference is ultimately minor, and should not be allowed to overshadow what is really at stake: democratic self-governance in an age of high public debt.
所有这些类型的非理性判断和决策都与智商毫不相关，也就是说智力测验可能无法捕捉到理性思维方面的个体差异。	All of these categories of failure of rational judgment and decision-making are very imperfectly correlated with intelligence – meaning that IQ tests tend not to capture individual differences in rational thought.
如果你想在与宿敌的关系中开辟“新的篇章 ” ， 你就不能简单地以否定或压制历史的方式合上“旧的篇章 ” 。	If you want to open “new chapters” in relations between old adversaries, you cannot simply close “old chapters” by denying or suppressing history.
接下来的一节仅隐晦提到暴露出最黑暗一面的犹太敲诈者（szmalcowniks ） ， “无论他们源起何种出身、宗教或抱有何种世界观 。 ”	In the next section, there is merely a veiled reference to the szmalcowniks who “regardless of their origin, religion, or worldview – revealed their darkest side.”
杰出的增长经济学家多马尔（Evsey Domar，我在MIT的教授之一）建议，缓解债务负担的问题本质上是取得国民收入增长的问题。	Evsey Domar, a legendary growth economist (and one of my MIT professors) counseled that the problem of alleviating the debt burden is essentially a problem of achieving growth in national income.
从2000到2015年，这一数字停留在每年2200万多一点，政府现在的目标是每年帮助1000万人脱贫。	From 2000 to 2015, the figure stood at just over 22 million per year. The government’s target now is to lift ten million people out of poverty annually.
最近的一项盖洛普民意测验表明， 在所有27个欧盟国家中被访人中，有36 ％表示不再信任议会；而唯一值得安慰的是，更大比例的被访者，即37 ％ 的人，现在也不信任欧盟委员会了。	A recent Gallup poll showed that 36% of people questioned in all 27 EU countries no longer trust the parliament, with the only consolation being that even more, 37%, now mistrust the European Commission.
一位知道如何同伊朗的权力层打交道的美国政客就是前国会议员，现任伍德罗•威尔逊中心主任的Lee Hamilton。	One American politician who understands how to work with the Iranian power structure is former Congressman Lee Hamilton, now head of the Woodrow Wilson Center.
美国在2020年依旧是最强大的国家，但是，自相矛盾的是，罗马时代以来最为强大的国家将无法独自保护其公民。	The US will remain the most powerful country in 2020, but, paradoxically, the strongest state since the days of Rome will be unable to protect its citizens acting alone.
大多数经济学家长期以来都对美国补贴住房所有权的政策表示不满，但他们中的大多数人却依然守口如瓶，到如今许多美国人根本不再想听专家的意见了。	Most economists have long frowned on US policies that subsidize homeownership. But most held their tongues.
他信的这种政策中有些项目是众所周知的绝路桥；但是，其他的一些项目真正地满足了农村的需要，包括：降低医疗成本，提供农业贷款补贴，以及维持政府价格补贴。	Some of these projects were the proverbial bridges to nowhere. But others did meet real rural needs: cutting medical costs, providing subsidized agricultural loans, and maintaining price supports.
当时我作为一名 《纽约客》 记者，刚刚从南越回国。 我在广义和广平两省亲眼目睹了美军空中力量所造成的破坏。	I had just returned from a trip to South Vietnam, where, as a reporter for The New Yorker, I witnessed the destruction, by American air power, of two provinces, Quang Ngai and Quang Tinh.
当本周冰岛总理宣布，俄罗斯可能带来大约50亿美元拯救其饱受困扰的经济的时候，世界对俄罗斯经济实力的兴趣显示出来了。	The glimpse of its economic muscle was revealed this week when the Prime Minister of Iceland announced that Russia may come with about $5 billion to save its troubled economy.
资助以色列对加沙和约旦河西岸地区的占领则同时满足了上述两个目的，而代价就是欧洲纳税人口袋里掏出的数十亿欧元。	Financing Israel’s occupation of Gaza and the West Bank served both objectives at the same time, at a cost to European taxpayers of several billion euros.
对于这种状况我们知之甚少，但在胃里装满咖啡的时候游泳 — — 我每天早上都处于这样的状态 — — 不是个好主意。	Not much is known about it, but it is probably not a good idea to swim – as I do every morning – with coffee in my stomach.
如果沃尔福威茨是一个毫无争议、最为合格的候选人，那么，挑选委员会就可以公开和透明地找到妥善处理此事的办法。	If Wolfowitz were otherwise overwhelmingly the most qualified candidate, the selection committee may have found a way to finesse the issue, openly and transparently.
大多数俄罗斯人在本国教育系统和媒体的不断误导下深信西方国家的情况要差得多（这个看法即使在这个“假新闻”时代也是极其夸张的 ） 。	Most Russians, constantly manipulated by their country’s schools and media, are convinced that conditions are much worse in the West (a hyperbolic claim even in the era of “fake news”).
如今世界并非陷于所谓“发展局限”的考虑之中，但是，人们对人类发展对于地球气候和生态系统的后果却越发了解。	The world is not preoccupied today by the “limits to growth,” but awareness of the consequences of growth on the earth’s climate and ecosystem is becoming prevalent.
与此类似，谢尔盖·洛兹尼察的电影《我的幸福》主要是讲述了一位名叫格奥尔基的乌克兰籍卡车司机的一生，他在荒郊迷了路，发现自己身处在一个典型的俄罗斯村庄之中，并随之卷入了当地居民的日常生活。	Similarly, Sergei Loznitsa’s My Joy simply explores the life of a Ukrainian truck driver named Georgy, who gets lost and finds himself in an archetypal Russian village, where he is drawn into daily life.
此外，在20世纪90年代在IMF以及2008—2009全球金融危机中在以色列央行任职期间，费希尔积累了丰富的危机管理经验。	Moreover, Fischer gained extensive crisis-management experience during his tenure at the IMF in the 1990’s and as Israel’s central banker during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.
纽约 - - 如今，奥巴马当选美国总统创造了历史。 整个亚太地区的人民都热切希望他将会与竞选时不同地关注亚洲。	NEW YORK – Now that Barack Obama has made history by being elected President of the United States, people throughout the Asia-Pacific region fervently hope he will focus on Asia in a way that he did not during the election season.
呼之欲出的衰退显然刺激了这一债务积累，也许前总理温家宝在2009年所实施的巨大财政刺激方案也起到了推波助澜的作用。	A looming recession undoubtedly spurred this debt accumulation, possibly aided by former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao’s massive 2009 stimulus package.
在复苏迅速而且职位充足的情况下，短期的补贴是很管用的，因为那种在找到工作前失去补助金的恐惧将促使工人努力去找工作。	Short-duration benefits may have been appropriate when recoveries were fast and jobs plentiful, because the fear of losing benefits before finding a job may have given workers an incentive to look harder.
我们的未来注意力不应该被最吓人的故事和声音最响的施压集团所左右，而应该根据关于我们在哪些方面做得最好的客观评估决定。	We should guide our future attention not on the basis of the scariest stories or loudest pressure groups, but on objective assessments of where we can do the most good.
关于以色列的煽动性言论加剧了想要成为伊朗伙伴的国家对它的不信任，并且使欧洲国家和美国想要和伊朗建立更良好的关系变得困难。	Incendiary statements about Israel exacerbate the lack of trust among Iran’s would-be partners, and make it hard for those in Europe and the US who are interested in building more favorable relations.
不难预料，国家级监管者总是倾向于对国内问题视而不见，因此，清算资不抵债银行的成本应该由各国自行承担似乎是自然而然的事情。	Given national supervisors’ predictable tendency not to recognize problems at home, it seemed natural that the cost of cleaning up insolvent banks should also be borne at the national level.
进入更多狩猎采集领地的好处显而易见，因此外来者 — — 特别是那些具备表现出基因不同的特征的外来者 — — 被视为危害。	Given the obvious benefits of having access to more territory in which to gather and hunt, outsiders – particularly those who bear characteristics that mark them as genetically distant – were treated as foes.
在美国，欧洲和日本这类高收入国家，最大的受害者莫过于那些缺乏教育因而无法和发展中国家低收入劳动者有效竞争的工人。	In high-income countries, notably the US, Europe, and Japan, the biggest losers are workers who lack the education to compete effectively with low-paid workers in developing countries.
有许多中国工程师在为印度的计算机公司和工程公司工作（并向它们学习 ） ， 与此同时，印度的软件工程师也在为中国的电信设备制造商华为停供支持。	There are dozens of Chinese engineers working in (and learning from) Indian computer firms and engineering companies, while Indian software engineers support the Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturer Huawei.
近几年来，世界主要央行采取了前所未有的宽松货币政策，包括德意志银行最新报告中所谓的“几百年来最低水平的利率 ” 。	In recent years, the world’s major central banks have pursued unprecedentedly easy monetary policies, including what a recent Deutsche Bank report calls “multi-century all-time lows in interest rates.”
财政联盟 — — 即更具强制性的联盟 — — 也许是解决当前金融危机的理性办法，但也是一个技术官僚主义办法，无助于欧洲变得更加民主，极有可能激发极端主义反动。	Fiscal union – that is, more imposed unity – may well be the rational answer to the current financial crisis, but it is a technocratic answer which would do nothing to make Europe more democratic, and would most likely provoke an extremist backlash.
进行会输掉的战争可能会让伊斯兰主义者感觉良好，但是，被打败是一个代价沉重的命题，因为他们的傲慢和好斗，使原本可以争取过来支持其事业的人对他们产生了反感。	Launching losing wars may make Islamists feel good, but being defeated is a costly proposition, for their arrogance and belligerence antagonizes many who might otherwise be won over to their cause.
最近，意大利遣返了一艘载有约600名移民的救生艇，事后萨尔瓦尼在Facebook上写道 ， “ 拯救生命是责任，把意大利变成巨大的难民营不是责任 。 ”	After recently turning away a rescue boat carrying some 600 migrants, Salvini wrote on Facebook that, “Rescuing lives is a duty, transforming Italy into an enormous refugee camp is not.”
因此，中国人如何对待朴槿惠可能更多反映了中国而不是韩国的变化 — — 这涉及到现代世界中国身份和使命等核心问题。	Thus, how the Chinese receive Park may turn out to be less a reflection of change in South Korea than a reflection of change in the People’s Republic – an issue that goes to the heart of China’s identity and mission in the modern world.
用户需要一个原件，把它插入KeyMe销售终端，就完成了注册；接着，他可以在KeyMe数据库中匿名储存这一设计，只能通过他的指纹或电子邮件（但不会有任何实体地址信息）访问。	The user needs one original, which he registers by inserting into the KeyMe kiosk; he can then store that design anonymously in KeyMe’s database, with unique access to it via his fingerprints and email (but with no reference to a physical address).
只有保证对新知识的探索仍是一项优先任务，欧洲才能在人口与其他地区相比不占优势的情况下捍卫科学革命并保持全球领先地位。	By ensuring that the pursuit of new knowledge remains a high priority, Europe can safeguard the scientific revolution and retain a leading edge globally, despite having fewer people than other regions.
1920年在德国爆发的极度通胀助长了巴伐利亚，莱茵兰以及萨克森地区的分离主义，因为这些偏远地区认为柏林的中央银行和中央政府歧视它们。	Hyperinflation in Germany in the 1920’s fanned separatism in Bavaria, the Rhineland, and Saxony, because these remote areas thought that Germany’s central bank and central government in Berlin were discriminating against them.
现任总统出身于伊斯兰革命卫队（确切地说，是圣城旅的拉马赞分队 ） ， 并且依靠该组织和巴斯基民兵的帮助通过打击自由派政治对手来巩固他的权力。	The current president comes out of the IRGC (specifically, the Ramazan Unit of the Quds Force), and has used that organization and the Basij to help consolidate his power by moving against more liberal political opponents.
近年来齐塔人招募的明星新锐大多具有危地马拉军队的特种部队背景，这支部队一种臭名昭著的入门技术是咬掉一只活鸡的头颅。	The Zetas’ star recruits in recent years have come from the Guatemalan military’s special forces, whose infamous induction technique involved biting off the head of a live chicken.
如果美国如它的领导们深信的，会多年受到恐怖组织的威胁，那么后者将会不可避免地推断并决定 - - 如上百万人以前做的那样 - - 最容易进入美国的途径是通过拉丁美洲。	If the US, as its leaders clearly believe, will be threatened for years to come by terrorist groups, the latter will inevitably conclude, as millions have done before, that the easiest way into the US is through Latin America.
也有说法认为现任联合国教科文组织总干事、保加利亚人伊琳娜·博科娃和两名斯洛伐克人 — — 外长米罗斯拉夫·拉查克及前任外长扬·库比什也加入到这场角逐。	There is also talk of current UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova, who is Bulgarian, and of two Slovaks, Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajčák and his predecessor, Jan Kubiš, entering the race.
人们捐血给素不相识的人，奔赴海地和苏丹等地实施人道主义救援，舍身忘死地与其他国家的不公正行为作斗争。	People donate their blood to strangers, travel on humanitarian missions to places such as Haiti and the Sudan, and risk their lives to fight injustice elsewhere.
因此，发展中国家在技术和工业方面落后意味着，在消除收入差距之前，它们的年增长率将是高收入国家的好几倍并能够持续数十年。	So developing countries’ backwardness in terms of technology and industry means that they can grow for decades at an annual rate several times that of high-income countries before they close the income gap.
迄今为止，奥基已经夺走了245条生命，并造成661人失踪，其中不少失踪在茫茫海上的渔民已不太可能找到下落。	So far, Ockhi is known to have taken 245 lives, with 661 still missing, many of whom were lost at sea and are unlikely ever to be found.
事实上，正在设法确定外层空间的法律地位的国际律师们往往以“南极条约体系”为范本，来回答如下之类的问题-谁拥有月球？	Indeed, international lawyers who are seeking to define the legal status of outer space – Who will own the moon?
网络中无处不在的地方利益和无时不在的冲突矛盾，包括迄今为止还没有解决的俄国对乌克兰和欧洲的天然气供应，再一次引发了人们对以能源为武器来获取政治影响的莫名恐惧。	Local interests and persistent conflicts that sit astride our networks, including the as yet unresolved issue of Russian gas supply to Ukraine and Europe, have again raised the specter of energy being used as a weapon to gain political leverage.
尽管这一决定会造成相当大的政治麻烦 — — 即立刻稀释苏格兰刚刚赢得的主权 — — 但其经济影响很难立刻看清。	While the decision would have a significant political downside – that is, immediately diluting Scotland’s newly acquired sovereignty – its economic implications are mixed.
将重点放在疫苗的校园推广的做法被证明是成功的，但不足以在入学率较低的国家接触足够多的女孩，特别是农村地区。	While the focus on holding vaccination sessions in schools has proved successful, it is inadequate for reaching girls in countries with low school-attendance rates, especially in urban areas.
幸运的是，德国、中国、法国、英国、俄罗斯和欧盟都承诺要捍卫JCPOA，与特朗普政府的对立立场划清界限。	Fortunately, Germany, China, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and the EU have all committed to defending the JCPOA, distancing themselves from the Trump administration’s reluctant stance.
为了增加这种改革的可能性，他们同意立刻削减开支、增加税收，只要关于全面财政改革计划的协议不对此问题作出新安排，就会立刻实施（即“财政悬崖 ” ） 。	To increase the likelihood of this, they agreed on immediate spending cuts and tax increases that would automatically kick in (the “fiscal cliff”) if agreement on a comprehensive set of fiscal reforms eluded them.
对于某些人而言，这是由于出兵伊拉克的决定；对于另一些人而言，这是由于关塔纳摩监狱以及人们所感受的美国司法制度的双重标准。	For some, it was the decision to go to war in Iraq; for others, it was Guantánamo and the perceived double standards of American justice.
但考虑到人类系在世界生态系统中演化而成，我们所做的每一件事 — — 杀绝物种、毁灭森林、污染大气 — — 都可以视为演化过程的自然产物。	But, given that humans evolved within the world’s biological system, everything we do – killing off species, razing forests, polluting the atmosphere – can be regarded as a natural product of the evolutionary process.
尽管美国一开始从中阻挠，并且至今仍拒绝加入，但这一决定在后来中国国家主席习近平和美国总统奥巴马的会谈中有了一些微妙的变化。	Though the US resisted at first, and has still refused to join, that decision was lent some nuance in a later conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama.
布莱尔的卸任导致布什在外交上进一步陷入孤立，而柏林和巴黎新当选的政府也只在表面上改善了和美国的关系。	Blair’s departure left Bush increasingly isolated diplomatically, with changes of government in Berlin and Paris bringing only superficial improvements.
在2012年12月迪拜举行的国际电信联盟峰会上，波兰前行政及数字化总理米哈尔·博尼在抵制政府控制互联网应用领域发挥了重要作用。	At the International Telecommunications Union summit in Dubai in December 2012, Michał Boni, a former Polish minister of administration and digitization, played an important role in blocking efforts to impose government controls on Internet use.
印度大概是最引人注目的反例，但不是唯一一个。 巴西、阿根廷、土耳其和墨西哥等国家均被韩国压得抬不起头。	India is probably the most spectacular counter-example, but it is not the only one. Countries like Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, and Mexico are dwarfed by countries like South Korea.
经合组织2016年按任务对职业进行分解的研究表明，在21个经合组织国家中仅有9%的工作岗位确实处在危险之中。	According to a 2016 OECD study that breaks down occupations by task, only 9% of jobs on average across 21 OECD countries are really at risk.
但是，根据他所披露的内容，我们可以知道他的计划将增加就业赤字、投资赤字和就业赤字，给未来增长和繁荣带来不良影响。	But, based on what he has revealed, we know that it would increase the jobs deficit, the investment deficit, and the opportunity deficit, with negative consequences for future growth and prosperity.
常因成功挑选出优势行业而广受好评的爱尔兰就依赖其知名的工业发展局（Industrial Development Agency）的技术实力来保障甄选过程的一致性和有效性。	Ireland, often praised for its success in picking winners, relied on the technical competence of its renowned Industrial Development Agency to safeguard the integrity and effectiveness of the selection process.
这在“在化学和物理定律层面是可能的 ， ” IPCC的吉姆·斯基（Jim Skea）说 ， “ 但需要前所未有的改变 。 ”	This is “possible within the laws of chemistry and physics,” notes Jim Skea of the IPCC, “but doing so would require unprecedented changes.”
显然，不论是逊尼派阿拉伯世界，还是现任美国政府，都在下注于 — — 甚至声援 — — 鲁哈尼的成功。	It is clear that neither the Sunni Arab world nor the current US government is betting on – or even rooting for – Rouhani’s success.
美国国务卿克里准备给以巴和平谈判成果轮带来一个框架性协议，而内塔尼亚胡对耶路撒冷的强硬立场决不是良好的开端。	As US Secretary of State John Kerry prepares to present a framework agreement for a conclusive round of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, Netanyahu’s hardline position on Jerusalem is simply a non-starter.
上述丑闻导致四名内阁部长辞职，并公开了一段录音，据称在这段录音中可以听到 埃尔多安告诉自己的儿子将高达数百万美元的不义之财处理掉。	The scandal led to the resignation of four cabinet ministers, and to the release of audio recordings in which Erdoğan allegedly can be heard telling his son to dispose of millions of dollars of ill-gotten funds.
可能的地点包括曾经计划过的位于西岸地区图尔卡雷姆和荷兹利亚之间的卡杜里工业园，以及加沙城外的卡尔尼工业区。	Possible sites include the once-planned Khaddourie industrial park between Tulkarem in the West Bank and Herzliya, and the Karni Industrial Zone outside Gaza City.
某一国的恶劣政治与经济环境并存状态很容易产生传染性，因为越来越多的移民会将政治压力和经济社会动荡扩大传播到其他国家。	The combination of bad politics and economics in one country can easily produce contagion, as rising migration spreads political stress and instability to other countries.
加拿大企业和工人，的生产率上升了14 % ， 多伦多大学经济学家丹尼尔·特雷富勒（Daniel Trefler）估计，这带来的好处相当于十年的生活水平改善。	The country’s firms and workers saw their productivity rise by 14%, leading to what the University of Toronto economist Daniel Trefler estimates is the equivalent of a decade’s improvement in living standards.
大部分主流经济学家都会认为，目前提出的减税规模最多能提高美国潜在增长20个基点，使增长率从2%左右增加到2.2 % 。	Most mainstream economists would estimate that a tax cut of the size being proposed would increase US potential growth by 20 basis points, at most, taking the growth rate from around 2% to 2.2% over time.
此外，根据即将发布的《经济复杂性报告 》 （ Atlas of Economic Complexity）的数据，这些经济体开始生产更复杂的产品，这是可持续增长的先兆。	Moreover, according to the soon-to-be-published Atlas of Economic Complexity, these economies began producing more complex products, a harbinger of sustainable growth.

卡扎菲由于美国入侵伊拉克而放弃核计划的说法遭到了弗林特·莱弗里特（Flynt Leverett）的驳斥，莱弗里特在2002到2003年间担任美国国家安全委员会中东事务部主任。	Claims that he abandoned his nuclear program in response to the US-led invasion of Iraq have been refuted by Flynt Leverett, director for Middle Eastern affairs at the US National Security Council from 2002 to 2003.
一天不这样做，危险的日子就一直要持续到奥巴马就职典礼的日子，而国际社会将需要强有力的冷静的政治家来完成使命。	Until this happens, dangerous days lie ahead until Obama’s inauguration, and the international community will need strong, level-headed politicians to see it through.
通过用促进消费的再平衡解决经济不稳定问题以及用免职薄熙来解决政治不稳定问题，稳定已经从一个风险因素转变为铁板一块了。	By addressing economic instability through pro-consumption rebalancing, and political instability by removing Bo, stability has gone from a risk factor to an ironclad commitment.
9月，世界领导人齐聚联合国参与了年度讨论，他们一致通过了以一个中心点：战胜贫困、饥饿和疾病的重要性事关人类整体生存大事。	The world leaders who met at the UN in September for the annual General Debate all agreed on a central point: the importance of fighting poverty, hunger, and disease is crucial for our collective survival.
在与哈梅内伊的相对地位上，拉夫桑贾尼比其后的所有总统都更加强势，因为当时哈梅内伊刚刚被选为最高领袖霍梅尼的继任者。	Rafsanjani was in a much stronger position vis-à-vis Khamenei, who had just been selected to succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader, than any of Iran’s subsequent presidents.
人们只是希望世界不会再重新经历上个世纪五、六十年代因为对货币的忽略而导致的高通货膨胀而付出的高昂学费。	One can only hope that the world does not have to go through the same process of pathological learning via high inflation which followed the neglect of money during the fifties and sixties of the last century.
他们中很多人投了反对党工党，不是因为他们想加入工会或者他们支持工党党首杰里米·科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn，不过他在选战期间的表现出人意料地令人印象深刻 ） 。	Many of them voted for Labour in protest, not because they wanted to join a trade union or because they support Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (although he gave an unexpectedly impressive performance throughout the campaign).
由于缺乏司法手段，越来越多的行贿受贿的受害者寻求法律外的手段，如罢工、游行、静坐以得到媒体和公众的关注。	With little recourse to legal means, an increasing number of frustrated victims of graft resort to extra-legal measures such as strikes, demonstrations, and sit-ins in order to gain media and public attention.
当然，蒙蒂并不是选出来的，他的地位并不巩固，并且已经产生了争议，但意大利存在积极的准共识，让他得以实施拖延已久的结构性改革。	Of course, no one elected Monti, and his position is fragile and already contested, but there is a positive near-consensus that has allowed him to launch long-overdue structural reforms.
另一个原因是伊拉克逊尼派少数群体的某些派系拒绝接受他们是中东阿拉伯地区唯一一群生活在什叶派多数群体中的逊尼派。	Another is that some elements of Iraq’s Sunni minority have refused to accept their status as the only Sunnis in the Arab Middle East to live under a Shia majority.
但正义与发展党和恩纳达党（Ennahda ） — —上述两党分别于2011年在各自所在的国家上台 — — 多年来一直缓慢地走向温和化，甚至世俗化。	But both the PJD and Ennahda – which came to power in their respective countries in 2011 – have for years been edging toward moderation, even secularization.
造成这种投资不足的因素有很多，但可能最主要的一点是在向许多发展中国家投资的过程中有不少中期的制度性障碍。 在这些国家里现在似乎长期投资的回报最高。	This investment shortfall is due to many factors, but perhaps the main one is that there are substantial medium-term institutional roadblocks to investment in many developing countries, where long-term returns now seem to be by far the highest.
但事实是几乎所有发生在西方或针对西方大使馆和西方人的恐怖袭击都伴随着一种声音 — — 这是对西方干预中东的报复。	But the fact is that almost every terrorist attack in the West or against Western embassies and personnel has been accompanied by the message that it is in retaliation for Western meddling in the Middle East.
因此新政府面对的最大挑战就是要实施成功的改革 — — 这种改革要让意大利经济的表现在经历多年错误政策和政府麻痹失职后赶上其他邻国。	The new government’s biggest challenge will be to implement reforms that enable Italy’s economic performance to catch up to that of its neighbors after years of bad policies and neglect.
在2014年的新兴市场，仅有约55%的成年人开立了银行或金融服务账户，却有近80%的成年人拥有移动电话。	In emerging markets in 2014, only about 55% of adults had a bank or financial-services account, but nearly 80% had a mobile phone.
但改革毒品法、为慢性瘾君子提供适当治疗以及严打追捕高级别毒贩能够降低非法毒品对社会、家庭和个人的伤害。	But reforming drug laws, offering chronic users proper treatment, and vigorously pursuing high-level drug traffickers will reduce the damaging impact of illegal drugs on communities, families, and individuals.
即使是在我们听说得最多的大西洋飓风盆地，由美国国家海洋和大气管理局测量的飓风总能（ ACE ） ， 自从2005年达到最高纪录以来已下降了三分之二。	Even for the Atlantic hurricane basin, which we tend to hear about the most, the total hurricane energy (ACE) as measured by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declined by two-thirds since the record was set in 2005.
相反，因为对敌人及其尊重未来和平协议承诺的不信任，或者受到吞并某些领土的欲望的驱使 — — 以色列开始推行所谓的定居点政策。	Instead, Israel – either because of its distrust of its enemies and of their commitment to respect any future peace agreement, or because of a desire to annex some of the territories – began to pursue a policy of settlements.
人们可能愿意用印度僵化的官僚体制和中国的高效进行对比，外国投资者在在中国面对红毯，而在印度却要面对繁琐的程序；截然相反的还有印度的党派政治和中国的党内等级。	One might like to contrast India’s sclerotic bureaucracy with China’s efficient one, India’s red tape with China’s red carpet for foreign investors, and India’s partisan politics with China’s Party hierarchy.
随着房地产泡沫的破裂，许多人丢到了自己的工作和医疗保险，还面临着丢掉房子的风险，一夜之间，他们就失去了所有对经济保持乐观的理由。	With the collapse of the housing bubble, many people lost their jobs and health insurance, risked losing their homes, and suddenly had little reason for economic optimism.
事实上，自2006年以来，轮状病毒一秒价格下降了67 % ， 每针价格已在2.5美元之下，而肺炎球菌结合疫苗的每针价格已经下降了90%至3.5美元。	Indeed, since 2006, the price of rotavirus vaccine has fallen by 67%, to just $2.50 per dose, while the price of a dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has plummeted by 90%, to $3.50.
美国的“中国幻想 ” — —詹姆斯·曼（James Mann）语 — — 彰显于克林顿支持中国加入世界贸易组织的观点中。	America’s “China fantasy,” as James Mann calls it, was exemplified by Bill Clinton’s argument in favor of allowing China’s admission to the World Trade Organization.
但定义其自我价值的更多的是找到在集体企业中的一席之地，并尽可能做好分配给你的工作，而不是追逐个人的名誉和财富。	But self-worth is defined less by individual fame or wealth than by having a place in a collective enterprise, and doing the job one is assigned as well as one can.
尽管激进伊斯兰主义者强烈反对他们的工作，但这些思想家对全世界一代又一代穆斯林知识分子产生了巨大影响。	While radical Islamists strongly oppose their work, these thinkers have had a huge influence on generations of Muslim intellectuals worldwide.
平心而论，在希腊造成的经济混乱 — — 拜政府挥霍、官员腐败和普遍逃税所赐 — — 缺失应该给予一些国际援助。	To be sure, the economic mess created in Greece – the result of government profligacy, official corruption, and widespread tax evasion – merited some international assistance.
虽然他并未具体说明自己究竟想干什么，但似乎想从劳尔·卡斯特罗争取更多的人权让步以换取奥巴马政府本已作出的单方面让步。	Though he has not specified what he means by this, he seems to want more concessions on human rights from Raúl Castro, in exchange for the unilateral concessions already made by the Obama administration.
除了家人和朋友之间的通讯之外，在新网络上传输的信息涉及了公共健康、医学治疗、教育、银行服务、商业以及娱乐等行业。	The information carried on the new networks spans public health, medical care, education, banking, commerce, and entertainment, in addition to communications among family and friends.
就算中方与美方步调一致且美国能摆脱储蓄的掣肘，但美方寻求用一种公式化的双边方案来解决自身多边问题的做法实际上也滥用了其信誉。	Even if the stars were in perfect alignment and the US was not facing a saving constraint, it stretches credibility to seek a formulaic bilateral solution to America’s multilateral problem.
更好的管理城市资产将协助地方领袖发展经济，为社会和经济基础设施融资，并为充满活力和创新的混合用途项目制定战略。	Managing city assets better would help local leaders boost their economies, finance social and economic infrastructure, and develop strategies for vibrant and innovative mixed-use projects.
最后一个方向是出现一个分散化的欧洲，不会有多少超越贸易层次的自上而下的协定，欧元区也会缩小，仅由品质均较好的核心欧盟国家组成。	In the final scenario, what emerges is a more decentralized Europe, with less top-down agreement in areas beyond trade and a smaller, more homogeneous eurozone composed of the EU’s core economies.
美元债券的发行是滥用的主要源头，投机者以官方汇率买入美元债券，卖出后获得美元，然后以高得多的黑市价格兑回玻利瓦尔。	The issuance of dollar bonds was a major source of abuse, with speculators buying dollar debt at the official exchange rate, selling it for greenbacks, and then exchanging them for bolivars at a much higher rate on the black market.
在美国，美国梦的核心因素 — “ 拥有自己的住宅”便被政府加以利用，政府以向广大低收入及中等收入家庭提供房贷为说辞，来掩盖其扩大信贷及消费的意图。	In the US, the expansion of home ownership – a key element of the American dream – to low- and middle-income households was the defensible linchpin for the broader aims of expanding credit and consumption.
降低公路事故死亡率是一个重要目标，科技公司的更多参与（以及老牌汽车公司的竞争）应该受到欢迎，符合改善公路安全性的利益。	Reducing road fatalities is an important goal, and the growing engagement of tech companies (and competition with the established auto companies) should be welcomed, in the interest of improving road safety.
联邦政府应该依托“进步联邦主义 ” （ progressive federalism）催化和用资金支持州级遏制再犯计划。	The federal government should rely on “progressive federalism” to catalyze and fund state-level programs to combat recidivism.
在此基础上，考虑到欧盟各经济体的规模和地理位置，我们可以弄清英国与其他欧盟国家的贸易究竟是高于还是低于预期。	On this basis, one can work out whether British trade with other EU countries is higher or lower than one would expect, given the size and location of their economies.
在这一情形中，员工在明白可以在想要的时候随时取出资金的情况下 — — 也就是说，不需要等到退休年龄 — — 自动注册401k计划。	In this scenario, employees are automatically enrolled in a 401k plan with the understanding that they may withdraw funds when they want them – that is, without waiting until they reach retirement age.
所有表现出 9 种症状中 5 种或 5 种以上的状况 — — 包括情绪低沉、缺乏乐趣、睡眠和进食困难、难以集中注意力和感觉疲劳 — — 只要持续超过两周以上就都被认定为抑郁症。	All conditions that display five or more of nine symptoms – including low mood, lack of pleasure, sleep and appetite difficulties, inability to concentrate, and fatigue – over a two-week period are now considered depressive disorders.
当前的国际金融体系依靠的是临时机制，这些临时机制通常在高额债务已经造成破坏性后果之后，才运转起来，这时通常已经为时已晚。	The current system relies on ad hoc mechanisms, which generally operate too late, after high indebtedness has already imposed devastating effects.
甚至埃克森美孚、雪佛龙、英国石油、皮博迪（Peabody ） 、 柯氏工业（Koch Industries）和其他石油和煤炭巨头也能有所助益。	There is even a place at the table for ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Peabody, Koch Industries, and other oil and coal giants.
伊朗（伊朗的经济在很大程度上依靠每天200多万桶石油的出口）寻找买家 — — 尤其是愿意支付全价的买家 — — 越来越难。	It is becoming more difficult for Iran (whose economy depends to a large extent on oil exports of more than two million barrels a day) to find customers – and especially customers willing to pay full price.
这解释了在关于贸易在发展中的角色上争论日渐增加的原因，尽管显而易见的事实是几十年来全球贸易的增加让数亿人走出了贫困。	This explains growing concern about the role of trade in development, despite the obvious fact that increased global trade has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in recent decades.
毕竟，作为法国国民阵线（National Front）的德国版的AfD从什么也不是，在9月的大选中一举成为德国第三大党，它将从公开辩论中获益。	Above all, the AfD, Germany’s version of the French National Front, which emerged from nothing as Germany’s third-largest party in the September election, will benefit from open debate.
当然，内塔尼亚胡在刻意夸大伊朗威胁以转移对以色列真正问题的关注 — — 特别是以色列与巴勒斯坦的长期冲突。	Of course, Netanyahu is intentionally exaggerating the Iranian threat to deflect attention from Israel’s real problems – especially its enduring conflict with Palestine.
但是最近在英国所做的另一项研究显示在几个国家所进行的关于针灸作为一种治疗由中风引起的破坏的手段的研究都同样显示它是很有效的。	But another recent study done in the UK showed that research conducted in several countries was uniformly favorable to acupuncture as a treatment for the damage caused by stroke.
而上述两种思维也被套用到了普京和梅德韦杰夫的关系之上 — — 用来解释两者之间关系的本质和内在动力，以及将为俄罗斯带来什么。	Both methods were used to describe the Putin-Medvedev relationship – to understand its nature and dynamic, and what it portends for Russia.
事实上，拜登之旅加深了日本的安全担心，因为这强调了美国重在平衡其在东亚的关系，即使这意味着容忍���张主义的中国，把它视为与盟友日本一样重要的战略考虑点。	In fact, Biden’s tour deepened Japan’s security concerns, because it highlighted America’s focus on balancing its relationships in East Asia, even if that means tolerating an expansionist China as the strategic equivalent of an allied Japan.
虽然该地区的政治架构变动是由所谓的“阿拉伯觉醒”所触发的，但其参与者并不仅限于阿拉伯世界或是中东冲突的范围。	And, while the tectonic shift in the region was triggered by the “Arab Awakening,” its players are not limited to the Arab world or to the confines of the Middle East conflict.
多边开发银行和海外开发援助每年对基础设施融资的支持充其量也只能有40—60亿美元，即预计需要量的2—3 % 。	Annual infrastructure financing from multilateral development banks and overseas development assistance is likely to amount to no more than $40-60 billion, or 2-3% of projected needs.
在这样的环境下，将于11月在南非德班举行的新一届联合国气候变化框架会议（UNFCCC）几乎没有受到任何关注。	In this context, the next meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), set for the end of November in Durban, South Africa, is passing totally unnoticed.
但是，由于俄国继续坚持其在九十年代早期做出的国策，也就是向西方开放，因此所有这些都并不构成俄国战略上的根本性变化。	Yet none of this amounts to a fundamental change in Russia’s strategy, because Russia continues to adhere to its fundamental decision, made in the early 1990’s, to open itself to the West.
但正如美国参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦（Elizabeth Warren）所指出的那样，这也为其带来了明确的副作用：如果公开透明会导致公众更难以接纳最终出台的产物，那就得好好质问一下这些谈判究竟怀着何种目的。	But, as US Senator Elizabeth Warren has put it, this gets it exactly backwards: If transparency would make it harder to sell the final product to the public, it raises serious questions about the desirability of what is being negotiated.
如果菲律宾想要吸引足够的投资以实现与马来西亚和泰国相当的生活水平，阿基诺三世就必须在任期内继续开放经济和打���腐败的政策。	If the Philippines is to attract enough investment to achieve living standards comparable to Malaysia and Thailand, Aquino must remain persistent in his efforts to open the economy and curtail corruption.
该国还在全球能源需求中所占的比例不断扩大，这意味着中国经济向服务和消费主导型增长的持续转型将重塑全球能源行业。	It also accounts for a growing share of global energy demand, meaning that its economy’s continuing shift toward service- and consumption-led growth will reshape the resource sector worldwide.
宣称公投产生了明确的赢家并在这样的投票结果基础上宣布独立是一种对常识和民主规则的歪曲，有可能玷污新生国家的整体合法性。	To say that the referendum produced a clear winner, and to base a declaration of independence on that vote, is a travesty of common sense and of democratic norms that would tarnish the nascent state as a grossly illegitimate enterprise.
一个世纪前，英国地缘政治理论家霍尔福德·麦金德（Halford Mackinder）指出，谁控制了欧亚内陆，谁就控制了世界。	A century ago, the British geopolitical theorist Halford Mackinder argued that whoever controlled the world island of Eurasia would control the world.
但美国确实行动起来推翻阿萨德，尽管大部分行动为秘密进行并且通过盟友完成，特别是沙特阿拉伯和土耳其（尽管两国不需要刺激就会干预叙利亚 ） 。	But the US did in fact act to topple Assad, albeit mostly covertly and through allies, especially Saudi Arabia and Turkey (though neither country needed much prodding to intervene).
尽管如此，过去五年来的增长不振仍表现出深度系统性金融危机后增长停滞的全部典型特征，我和莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）在2009年的著作《这次不一样 》 （ This Time is Different）中描述了这些特征。	Nevertheless, the subpar growth of the past half-decade still bears all the hallmarks of a typical sluggish recovery from a deep systemic financial crisis, as Carmen Reinhart and I documented in our 2009 book This Time is Different.
换句话说，当政府提供资金用于培训某种特定类型的工程师、修建特定公路或建设特定实验室时，就给了某些部门其他部门没有的优待，从而在事实上挑选了赢家。	In other words, when a government provides money to train a particular kind of engineer, lay out a particular road, or build a particular lab, it is favoring one sector over others, and hence de facto picking winners.
此外，面对快速但是分配不公的经济增长，我们也可以实施一些项目关注那些被落在后面的人，从而缓解悲伤的情绪。	Moreover, fast-paced but ill-distributed economic growth can be accompanied by programs that focus on those who are left behind, thereby mitigating grievances.
而在流行病学上（比如研究维他命、日常饮食或荷尔蒙与普通人群的健康的联系 ） ， 五分之四最有威信的研究成果很快就被否定了。	For epidemiology (e.g. studies on vitamins, diet, or hormones in terms of their association with health outcomes in the general population), four-fifths of the most prestigious findings were rapidly contradicted.
尽管各国有观点认为，美国是中国、墨西哥、伊朗和欧盟等外国势力的牺牲品 — — 但特朗普对普京的狂热却从未改变过。	Despite a worldview that regards the United States as a victim of foreign powers – China, Mexico, Iran, the European Union – Trump’s ardor for Putin burns bright.
美国的两大政党似乎都不愿意直面这一事实：修补银行体系虽是必须的，但并不足以让经济重回健康（或者说，金融体系从未被真正地修复 ） 。	No one in either US political party seems willing to face the fact that fixing the banking system, though necessary, was not sufficient to restore the economy to health (or that the financial system was never really fixed).
他们因此会加速而不是降低生产从而避免在有关二氧化碳排放的忧虑达到顶点、参加各国降低消费的人工措施最大程度地降低了石油价格的时候再出售他们的石油。	They will therefore speed up rather than reduce production, in order to avoid selling their oil when anxiety about CO2 peaks and the artificial measures of the signing countries to reduce their consumption have dampened the oil price most.
2007年前，全球增长（用IMF的方法）落在4.5—5%区间，其基础是工业国生产率稳步改善以及中国、巴西和俄罗斯等新兴市场生活水平的迅速提高。	Before 2007, global growth (using the IMF’s methodology) was in the 4.5-5% range, based on steady productivity improvements in industrial countries and rapidly rising living standards in large emerging markets such as China, Brazil, and Russia.
他曾任尼赫鲁大学（ JNU ）环境学院冰川学教授、印度理工学院（ IIT ）与荷兰代尔夫特理工大学（ TU Delft ）研究员。	He was Professor of Glaciology at Jawaharlal Nehru University’s School of Environmental Sciences and a fellow of the Indian Institute of Technology and of Delft Technical University in the Netherlands.
加纳1995年开始在小学和初中阶段实行免费义务教育，但执行情况不尽人意 — — 学生的求学梦往往在升读高中之前就告终。	Ghana had introduced free compulsory education at the primary and junior high school levels in 1995, but implementation had been painfully slow – and students’ educational dreams were often cut off before high school.
此外，根据可接受的解释，像法国、德国、日本甚至中国和印度这样的大国也应该出现在全球大学排行榜的前列。	Moreover, according to the accepted explanation, large countries such as France, Germany, Japan, and even China and India should also be represented at the top of global university rankings.
但普京随后支持这一动作，不是因为他认可与哈马斯关系密切的土耳其获得更大的加沙事务发言权的想法，而是因为他想表示俄罗斯是该地区的关键行动方。	But Putin subsequently endorsed the move, not because he likes the idea of Turkey, which also has close ties with Hamas, gaining a greater say in the affairs of Gaza, but because he wanted to present Russia as a key regional actor.
发自伯克利 — — 在连续实现了95个月的就业增长后，美国失业率已降至3.7％这这个1969年以来的最低点。	BERKELEY – After 95 consecutive months of job growth, the United States unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7%, its lowest point since 1969.
根据国际货币基金组织发布的《2011年4月实际经济展望 》 ， 虽然资本流动的波动性在全球范围内都有所上升，但新兴经济体的上升幅度要比发达经济体要大。	According to the International Monetary Fund’s April 2011 World Economic Outlook, though the volatility of capital flows has increased worldwide, it is higher in emerging market economies than in advanced economies.
虽然土耳其、中国和埃及等国在国内迫害记者的行为令人遗憾，但我们决不能允许国际刑警组织参与这样的行动。	While it is lamentable that countries like Turkey, China, and Egypt persecute journalists at home, we must not allow Interpol to become complicit in such behavior.
传统上，我们会在人权会议上将（强制性）公民和政治权利（如人身保护权）与（愿景性）经济权利区分开来，因为后者要求投入资源。	We have traditionally distinguished in human-rights conventions between (mandatory) civil and political rights, such as the right to habeas corpus, from (aspirational) economic rights, because the latter require resources.
从某种意义上说，这些逊尼派集团在黎巴嫩北部建立了一个武装飞地，抗击什叶武装势力在贝鲁特，南部以及贝特区域的飞地。	In a sense, these Sunni groups are creating an armed enclave in northern Lebanon to counterbalance the armed Shia enclaves in Beirut, the south, and the Bekaa region.
现在，它已经被逼到了一个狭小的区域，不再占据斯里兰卡北部的大部分地区，并且只能进行像最近用小型飞机轰炸首都科伦坡的税务局大楼这样无计划的军事噱头了。	Instead of commanding much of northern Sri Lanka, they are now confined to a shrinking pocket, and are reduced to mindless military stunts such as the recent bombing by light aircraft of the tax administration building in the capital, Colombo.
自7月26日欧洲央行行长德拉吉宣布将“竭尽全力”捍卫欧元以来，欧元对美元汇率已经上升了近10 % 。	The euro has strengthened by nearly 10% against the dollar since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed on July 26 to do “whatever it takes” to hold the currency together.
比如，2006—2011年，我们将农业预算提高了一倍，向低收入家庭发放了2000多头奶牛，还扩大了卢旺达的牛奶输送和蔬果园。	Between 2006 and 2011, for example, we doubled the agriculture budget, distributed more than 2,000 cows to low-income families, and expanded milk delivery and fruit and vegetable gardens across the country.
与此同时，各个欧盟成员国分别与石油和天然气的生产国之间进行的双边谈判降低了成员国讨价还价的能力，同时也削弱了欧洲在世界事务中的地缘政治力量。	At the same time, however, purely bilateral negotiations between individual EU members and oil- and gas-producing countries weakens the member states’ bargaining power, as well as undermining Europe’s geopolitical weight in world affairs.
同一天，包括美国、英国、德国、印度、中国和巴西在内的二十国同意将绿色能源投资扩大一倍，总额达到每年200亿美元。	On the same day, a group of 20 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, India, China, and Brazil, agreed to double their investment in green energy, to a total of $20 billion a year.
某些情况下，甚至可以不通过加税来获得资金：政府可以通过收取使用费创造收入流，捕捉财产升值或出售现有资产并实现利润回收。	In some cases, funding can be found without raising taxes: governments can create revenue streams by instituting user charges, capturing increases in property value, or selling existing assets and recycling the proceeds.
而在泰国爆炸案发生前几周，即8月13日，对也门西北部萨达（Saada）地区一间学校的空袭造成十名儿童死亡，30多名儿童受伤。	And just weeks before the Thailand bombing, on August 13, air strikes on a school in Yemen’s northwestern Saada region killed ten children and injured about 30 more.
宗教精英学者的权力已经慢慢地被军事安全组织所侵蚀殆尽 — — 总统艾哈迈迪·内贾德就是从中崭露头角的。	The clerical elite has gradually lost power to the military-security groups, from whose ranks President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad emerged.
由于每个人都有这样那样的不良基因，因此，在 淘汰 患病风险高于平均水平的子女，和 挑选 健康前景特别乐观的子女之间，不存在一条清晰的界线。	Since everyone carries some adverse genes, there is no clear line between selecting against a child with above-average risks of contracting a disease and selecting for a child with unusually rosy health prospects.
虽然劳动者数量从1970到2010年间年均增加1.6 % ， 但国会预算办公室预测在未来十年间年度就业增长会下跌到仅为0.4 % 。	While the number of persons working increased by 1.6% per year, on average, from 1970 to 2010, the CBO forecasts that the rate of annual employment growth will fall to just 0.4% in the coming decades.
投入品市场（如能源市场和中间产品市场）运行不畅也可以造成诸多经济伤害，其中一个原因是他损害了外部竞争。	The poor functioning of input markets, such as markets for energy or intermediary products, can also do a lot of economic harm, not least because it hampers external competitiveness.
但此前美国和英国等国家的鸽派央行都在蠢蠢欲动，要收回它们自2008年全球金融危机爆发以来所采取的宽松的货币政策。	But previously dovish central banks in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are itching to roll back the accommodative monetary policies that they have pursued since the eruption of the global financial crisis of 2008.
我们建议，在G20的政治支持下，非洲各国政府、国际组织和双边合作伙伴准备一套全面的、根据各国具体情况制定的投资契约，以鼓励私人投资。	We propose that, with the G20’s political backing, African governments, international organizations, and bilateral partners prepare comprehensive, country-specific investment compacts to encourage private-sector investment.
这是个困难的决定，但在总体债务水平已经很高的情况下（更不用说入不敷出的退休基金和医疗保险负债了，这两者都有可能继续增加 ） ， 时机已经到来。	It’s a tough call, but with overall debt levels already high (not to mention unfunded pension and medical insurance liabilities, which are both likely to rise), perhaps the time has come.
因此，难怪走私CFC或者氟利昂在人们没有注意的情况下发展起来，对《维也纳公约》和《蒙特利尔议定书》造成危害。	So it is no surprise that CFC or freon smuggling has developed without much attention, and risks jeopardizing the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol.
这有利于刺激它们自身增长，同时为中国经济创造空间，向生产率和工资 — — 消费的重要决定因素 — — 更高的价值链上游迈进。	That promises to boost their own growth while creating space for the Chinese economy to move up the value chain, where productivity and wages – important determinants of consumption – are higher.
全球目击组织（Global Witness）的报告记录，光是2015年就有16个国家的185人被杀。	A Global Witness report documented 185 killings across 16 countries in 2015 alone.
但在大部分经济领域 — — 税收、贸易政策、金融稳定、财政和货币管理等 — — 从全球角度看有意义的政策从国内角度看也有意义。	But in most economic areas – taxes, trade policy, financial stability, fiscal and monetary management – what makes sense from a global perspective also makes sense from a domestic perspective.
这些危机带来重大消极需求冲击，因为过重的债务和下跌的资产价格损害了资产负债表，而这需要用增加储蓄来弥补 — — 于是就形成了对增长产生致命影响的组合。	Such crises cause major negative demand shocks, as excess debt and falling asset prices damage balance sheets, which then require increased savings to heal – a combination that is lethal to growth.
回到今年四月，二十国集团领袖已经承认投资于低碳的基础设施、特别是能源服务是确保真正可持续经济和环境未来的关键所在。	Back in April, G-20 leaders accepted that investing in a low-carbon infrastructure, particularly energy services, is key to a truly sustainable economic and environmental future.
除非并且直到美国人的消费模式发生改变或者美元反弹从而增加石油产量，美国人将首当其冲的受到石油用单一货币计价的影响。	Unless and until US consumption patterns change or a rebounding dollar increases oil production, Americans will bear the brunt of single-currency oil pricing.
亚洲的人口飙升 — — 到2050年亚洲人口可能增长25%并达到50亿左右 — — 将导致粮食、能源和水资源供应压力进一步加重。	Asia’s surging population – which could jump by 25%, topping five billion, by 2050 – will put even more stress on food, energy, and water supplies.
特朗普的气候变化政策对美国和世界民众而言绝非好的征兆 — — 许多美国民众现在正在动员抵制特朗普内阁。	Trump’s climate-change policy does not bode well for US citizens – many of whom are now mobilizing resistance to his administration – or the world.
一些公司，如C3能源公司（C3 Energy ） ， 提供能够分析电力网络以改善电网经营和资产利用，从而增加利润的电力行业软件。	Some companies, such as C3 Energy, offer electric utilities software that can analyze their electrical networks to improve grid operations and asset utilization, thereby increasing profits.
相反，硅谷创业企业享受着来自VC的慷慨资金支持，自20世纪80年代以来，美国风险投资总量的30—35%流向了硅谷。	Silicon Valley startups, by contrast, enjoy the generous support of VC funds, having received 30-35% of all venture investment deployed in the US since the 1980s.
类似地，鼓励企业提高工资的政策将增加家庭收入和国内消费，但涨工资也可能侵蚀出口竞争力，阻碍外国直接投资的涌入。	Likewise, while policies that encourage firms to increase wages will raise household income and domestic consumption, wage increases can erode export competitiveness and choke off inflows of foreign direct investment.
遗憾的是，尽管个体DNA状况将很快成为药物销售依据的说法正日益成为生物技术的最新魔咒，药物销售如今仍是大规模综合业务的事实并未改变。	Unfortunately, while the new mantra of biotechnology is to claim that someday soon pharmaceuticals will be marketed to individuals based on their DNA, the fundamental truth is that selling drugs is still a mass-market business.
2008年，大萧条叙事再次风靡一时，各种关于金融恐慌和围聚在关门银行周围的愤怒人群的生动故事不绝于耳。	In 2008, the Great Depression narrative was being recycled everywhere, with all its colorful stories of financial panic and angry crowds forming around closed banks.
大部分高收入国家 — — 美国、欧洲大部和日本 — — 投资不足，或没有明智地以未来最佳用途为目标投资。	Most high-income countries – the US, most of Europe, and Japan – are failing to invest adequately or wisely toward future best uses.
在金融和经济领域，新的多极状态已经引发了IMF的配额改革，也使G20的整合成为多边经济政策合作的主会场。	In the financial and economic arena, this new multipolarity has already led to quota reforms at the International Monetary Fund and resulted in the consolidation of the G-20 as the premier venue for multilateral economic-policy coordination.
但该法案反对者的论点中有一个显著的弱点：他们隐晦地暗示了同性婚姻合法化的“意外后果 ” ， 他们不能明确说出这一后果是什么。	But there is a glaring weakness in the arguments of the bill’s opponents: while they hint darkly at the “unintended consequences” of legalizing same-sex marriage, they cannot spell out exactly what these consequences would be.
就像比尔和梅林达盖茨将在下周纽约举行的世界领导人会议上讨论并在一份新报告中所阐述的那样，我们需要采取集体行动来改善各个方面的性别不平等并推动进步。	As Bill and Melinda Gates will discuss at a gathering of world leaders next week in New York, and show in a new report, collective action is needed to address the various dimensions of gender inequality and drive progress.
在许多邻国（不仅仅是美国）深感不安的情况下，习近平访问越南和总理李克强访问韩国都是与习马会类似的外交手段。	Having unsettled many of his neighbors, not just the Americans, his upcoming visit to Vietnam, and his prime minister Li Keqiang’s visit to South Korea, are of a piece with his dinner-hour diplomacy with Ma.
随着技术培训已经走上正轨，我们必须为缓解当前风险迅速采取行动，同时还要确保我们正在为避免未来威胁奠定所需的基础。	And with the technology train already hurtling down the track, we must act fast to mitigate current risks and ensure that we are laying the groundwork needed to avoid future threats.
但根据其官方《国家安全战略》的说法，美国也在寻求适应“和平而繁荣的中国的崛起，与我们合作处理共同挑战和共同利益 。 ”	Yet the United States, according to its official National Security Strategy, is also committed to accommodating “the emergence of a China that is peaceful and prosperous and that cooperates with us to address common challenges and mutual interests.”
如果西方领导人想要遏制并最终平息各自国家所发生的经济抽风，就必须以打造新的包容性增长模式来应对，除此之外别无他法。	If Western leaders are to contain, and ultimately quell, the political convulsions that their countries are now experiencing, they have no choice but to respond by crafting new, inclusive growth models.
由埃及情报机构负责人奥马尔•苏莱曼主持的高层会谈将对结束哈马斯治下的加沙和由得到西方支持的马哈茂德·阿巴斯管理的法塔赫的西岸间近两年的血腥对抗非常关键。	The top-level talks, hosted by Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, will be crucial to ending nearly two years of bloody confrontation between Hamas-ruled Gaza and the Fatah-ruled West Bank, governed by Western-backed Mahmoud Abbas.
在1947年的德里，帕特尔坚决而高效地要求保护穆斯林，将最脆弱地区的10 000人纳入著名的德里红堡的卵翼之下。	In Delhi in 1947, Patel immediately and effectively moved to protect Muslims, moving 10,000 in the most vulnerable areas to the security of Delhi’s historic Red Fort.
因此当他发表“我认为那些大银行仍然是大而不能倒，并继续对我们的经济构成显著且持续的风险 。 ” 这番谈话时自然就引起了人们的警觉。	So people pay attention when he says, “I believe the biggest banks are still too big to fail and continue to pose a significant, ongoing risk to our economy.”
广岛/长崎 — — 4月27日，核不扩散条约的190个成员国代表将在纽约召开为期四周的会议审查这项拥有45年历史的协议。	HIROSHIMA/NAGASAKI – On April 27, representatives of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty’s 190 member countries will meet in New York for a four-week review of the 45-year-old pact.
全球54个国家的调查发现，国家代表性样本中最多有19%的男性表示在过去的一年里买过春，全球平均水平则达到了9—10 % 。	Surveys across 54 countries worldwide have found that up to 14% of men in nationally representative samples – and a global average of 9-10% – report paying for sex in the past year.
普华永道管理咨询公司对384家欧元区企业的最新调查中，三分之二的受访者表示在过去一年中实施了一些回岸动作，50%的受访者表示准备在明年这样做。	In a recent survey of 384 firms in the eurozone by the management consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers, two-thirds of the respondents said that they had reshored some activities during the past year, and 50% plan to do so in the next.
从亚洲的角度看，否决欧洲股东的IMF将大踏步地脱胎换骨，成为一个新机构：真正的国际货币基金组织，而不再是今天的欧洲-大西洋货币基金组织。	From an Asian perspective, by defying its European shareholders, the IMF would have gone a long way toward heralding the emergence of a new institution: a truly International Monetary Fund, in place of today’s Euro-Atlantic Monetary Fund.
从政治意义上说，阿齐兹三年前就已经死了；事实上，从2011年6月他前往纽约接受治疗以来，沙特年轻人就在网络上流传各种阿齐兹身故的传言。	Sultan had already been dead – politically, that is – for the last three years; indeed, since June 2011, when he left for New York for medical treatment, young Saudis speculated on numerous Web sites that this was also literally the case.
1944年国际货币基金组织成立后，其中很多决定失去了曾经的趣味性成了家常便饭，但却大大降低了执行的难度。	Following the creation of the IMF in 1944, many of the same decisions became routine, a lot less interesting, and much easier to implement.
但是，近距离的检视表明，金融创新大部分无非是更好地蒙骗他人、操纵市场而不被抓住（或者在相当长的时间里不被抓住）以及利用市场权力。	But, upon closer inspection, it became clear that most of this innovation involved devising better ways of scamming others, manipulating markets without getting caught (at least for a long time), and exploiting market power.
正如有关干细胞研究的道德辩论已经澄清的那样，单一的全球政策很不容易被人们接受或执行，而且这也丝毫不值得大惊小怪。	As has been made clear from the ethical debates on stem-cell research, a global policy cannot easily be adopted or enforced, nor should it be.
正如联合国紧急纾困协调员阿莫斯（Valerie Amos）所坚持的，援助不应该只是不知何时才能结束的日内瓦和平谈判的开胃菜；而应该成为谈判的核心。	Aid should not be a mere side show to the seemingly endless peace talks taking place in Geneva; as United Nations emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos insisted, it must be central to those negotiations.
美国认为在外交政策中，意图是一个很重要的因素，它相信，只要中国认识到其实力的极限在哪里，就会自然而然地产生和平结构。	The US, convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy, believes that once China recognizes the limits to its power, a structure of peace will follow naturally.
它进一步激发了关于难民和外国居民问题的热烈公众讨论，这场讨论不但席卷了意大利还波及到整个欧洲，并使该案的意义得到进一步提升。	The case gained significance by adding fuel to the fiery public debates now underway not only in Italy but across Europe on the status of refugees and foreign residents.
因此，不管你采取什么视角，都很难摆脱这样的结论：共和党减税将扩大贸易和经常项目赤字，与特朗普的承诺南辕北辙。	So, whichever approach one takes, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the Republican tax cut will widen the trade and current-account deficits, achieving the opposite of what Trump has promised.
加利福尼亚州门洛帕克 — — 自从2016年11月举行的美国总统大选凸显出数字渠道面对假消息是多么脆弱无助以来，关于如何打击“假消息”的辩论就从未停止过。	MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA – Ever since the November 2016 US presidential election highlighted the vulnerability of digital channels to purveyors of “fake news,” the debate over how to counter disinformation has not gone away.
城市的人均收入高于农村，因此预计如今世界城市占据着全球收入的80%以上，其中最大的600个城市就占据了一半。	Because per capita incomes are higher in cities than in rural areas, the world’s cities today are estimated to account for more than 80% of global income, with the largest 600 accounting for around half.
拉加德告诉欧洲人，他们的银行需要重组，否则就必须建立防火墙防止金融传染。 忠言逆耳，但欧洲人还是照办了。	The Europeans did not like it much when Lagarde told them their banks needed to be restructured or that they needed to build a firewall to protect against financial contagion – but they did it.
华盛顿—2015年是艰难的一年，这一年，增长预测值下滑，发生了可怕的恐怖袭击、大规模难民和严重的政治挑战，许多国家都兴起了民粹主义。	WASHINGTON, DC – The year 2015 was difficult, punctuated by declining growth forecasts, horrific terror attacks, massive refugee flows, and serious political challenges, with populism on the rise in many countries.
发自拉马拉 — — 作为巴勒斯坦解放组织中占据领导地位的游击运动阵线，法塔赫在成为一个一般意义上的政党之路上又向前迈进了一步。	RAMALLAH – Fatah, the leading guerrilla movement within the Palestine Liberation Organization, has moved one step closer to becoming a normal political party.
外国海底拖网渔船肆无忌惮地捕捞而不受惩罚，它们拖拽巨网，横扫我们的海床，破坏了令人咋舌的120,000平方公里的重要海洋生物栖息地。	Foreign bottom trawlers have fished recklessly and acted with impunity, dragging heavy nets, razing the bottom of our seafloor, and damaging an astounding 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) of important marine habitat.
格雷对第一个弊端的回应是，尽管反衰老治疗在初期可能相当昂贵，但价格是会下降的，很多其他创新就是如此，比如计算机和防治艾滋病药物。	De Grey’s response to the first objection is that, while anti-aging treatment may be expensive initially, the price is likely to drop, as it has for so many other innovations, from computers to the drugs that prevent the development of AIDS.
而此举虽然严重削弱了日本的防御能力，但美国专门派遣了一艘航空母舰和巡洋舰来维护东亚安全局势，同时美军也与自卫队一道搜索灾难失踪者。	While this severely weakened Japan’s defenses, the US ensured East Asia’s security by deploying an aircraft carrier and cruisers, and American forces also searched for missing victims together with the JSDF.
2014年5月，世卫组织同样宣布脊灰野病毒的国际传播也是国际关注的公共卫生紧急状况；但上述状况迄今一直生效，让人不禁怀疑世界领导人是否给予了足够的关注。	In May 2014, the WHO declared the international spread of wild poliovirus a PHEIC as well; yet that status is still active today, leaving one to wonder if world leaders are paying sufficient attention.
但在财政刺激促进国内外经济增长，通过世界贸易相互增强各国国力的时候，货币政策却主要受国内目标引导，在短期内一个国家的收益会是另一个国家的损失。	But, whereas fiscal stimulus boosts growth at home and abroad, enabling mutual reinforcement through world trade, monetary policy is guided primarily by domestic goals, and, in the short term, one country’s gain can be another’s loss.
但是在今天的缅甸，这种以同情心和不使用暴力为根基的精神哲学却随着僧侣们挑战统治我们国家的军人集团的霸权而出人意料地呈现出了反抗和拒不服从的一面。	But in Burma today, this spiritual philosophy, rooted in compassion and non-violence, has assumed unexpected dimensions of defiance and recalcitrance, as monks challenge the hegemony of the military junta that rules our country.
但即便这一雄心勃勃的目标无法在所有各国都同时实现，新兴经济体依然拥有相当大的空间去实现生产力增长的赶超。	But, even if that ambitious goal is not achievable everywhere, emerging economies have considerable scope for catch-up productivity growth.
1999年，中国成立了四家资产管理公司接管四大国有银行不良程度最高的贷款，从而改善了这些银行的财务稳定性。	In 1999, it established four asset-management companies (AMCs) to take on the weakest loans of the four largest state-owned banks, thereby improving those banks’ financial stability.
事实上，西方政府应该继续利用与埃及军方和未来民事领导人的渠道来促使他们赞成法治精神、保持行动克制、尊重言论自由。	Indeed, Western governments should continue to use their channels to the Egyptian military and future civil leadership to encourage them to uphold the rule of law, to act with restraint, and to respect free expression.
��力革命最终可能和平解决，但在像中东那样随处可见悬而未决的深层宗派恩怨的地方，这样的结果似乎不太可能。	Violent revolutions can reach peaceful resolutions, but such an outcome is less likely where deep, unresolved sectarian grievances are in play, as they are in the Middle East.
他的支持是2006年玻利维亚总统埃沃·莫拉莱斯当选的决定因素，虽然引发了激烈的争论，但在其后的一年里他又支持了尼加拉瓜的丹尼尔·奥尔特加和厄瓜多尔的拉斐尔·科雷亚。	His backing was a decisive influence in the election of Bolivia’s President Evo Morales in 2006, and the following year he supported Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Rafael Correa in Ecuador, though his impact on their victories is hotly debated.
相较之下，2005年的评估将会代表布什政府几年以来的思考成果，因而会成为美国未来国防政策的一项重要指标。	The 2005 review, by contrast, will represent several years of thinking by the Bush administration, and thus will serve as a key indicator of the future course of American defense policy.
叙利亚库尔德政治代表因此主张谈判解决，并随时准备坐下来与任何人 — — 包括政府或叛军 — — 达成和平协议。	That is why Syrian Kurds’ political representatives advocate a negotiated settlement, and are willing to sit down with anyone – regime or rebels – to achieve a peace agreement.
2009年信用迅速扩张导致了大宗商品部门、钢铁等基本产业以及（特别是）房地产业的规模巨大的过度投资和过剩产能。	The rapid expansion of credit in 2009 led to huge over-investment and excess capacity in commodity sectors, basic industries like steel, and especially real estate.
不过人们必须担心五大科技企业的统治力、盈利能力和业务覆盖范围是否已经过大，以至于创业公司很难对其发起挑战，最终扼杀了创新。	Still, one has to worry that the big five tech firms have become so dominant, so profitable, and so encompassing that it has become very difficult for startups to challenge them, thereby stifling innovation.
上述方面的重要举措是美国商务部上月决定将所谓IANA功能 — — 即互联网“地址簿”功能 — — 的监管权移交给国际互联网域名和编号分配公司（ICANN ） 。	An important step in this direction was the US Commerce Department’s decision last month to hand oversight of the so-called IANA functions – the “address book” of the Internet – to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
该决议呼吁野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约的182个成员国保护野生动物利益，同时实实在在地惠及贫困人口和农村群众。	The resolution calls on the 182 CITES member countries to protect the interests of wildlife as well as to provide tangible benefits for the poor and rural communities.
如果中国想要在与美国的贸易战中找到盟友，就必须大量修改构成针对外国竞争者的事实歧视的国内监管和做法。	If China wants allies in its trade war with the US, it will have to revise many domestic regulations and practices that constitute de facto discrimination against foreign competitors.
美国允许塞尔维亚加入北约的和平伙伴计划，尽管塞尔维亚拒绝将二十世纪九十年代波斯尼亚塞族的军事领导人姆拉迪奇将军引渡到海牙接受战争罪的指控。	The US allowed Serbia into NATO’s Partnership for Peace, despite Serbia’s refusal to extradite General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serbs’ military leader in the 1990’s, to The Hague to face war crimes charges.
巴西和其他国家曾抱怨“热钱”流入和“货币战争 ” ， 而如今，它们猛然得到了欲得之物：美联储提早退出QE的可能性。	Brazil and other countries that complained about “hot money” inflows and “currency wars,” have now suddenly gotten what they wished for: a likely early end of the Fed’s QE.
是的，商业部门、军队和教堂等传统上受右派把持的选区会发现新政府更对胃口，但几乎不可能出现朝着右翼方向的剧烈转折。	Yes, traditional constituencies of the right, such as the business sector, the military, and the Church, will find a somewhat more welcoming government, but a sharp rightward turn is unlikely.
目前，当富裕国家遭遇经济寒流时，贫穷国家将面临双倍传染：它们的贸易盈利剧降，来自富裕国家的援助和投资流也会干涸。	At present, when the rich part of the world catches an economic cold, the poorer countries face a double contagion: Their trade earnings plummet, and flows of aid and investment from richer countries dries up.
但在2005年和2006年连续两次在国际原子能机构理事会会议上对伊朗投了反对票后印度遭到了对方的报复，一份利益极大，为期25年价值220亿美元的液化天然气交易就此取消。	Yet, by voting against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency’s governing board meetings in 2005 and 2006, India invited Iranian reprisal in the form of cancellation of a highly favorable 25-year, $22 billion liquefied-natural-gas deal.
这点在科特迪瓦尤其明显：是联合国明确要求法国这个唯一的外国存在去执行决议，承认瓦塔拉当选总统并废黜巴博。	This is even clearer in Côte d’Ivoire: it is the UN that explicitly demanded that France, the only foreign presence, implement the resolution that ratified Ouattara as the elected president and Gbagbo as the usurper.
当乔治·W·布什2001年宣誓就任时，他本想增加国防开支、部署反导系统并解除几项长期多边武器控制义务。	When George W. Bush took office in 2001, he expected to increase defense spending, deploy an anti-missile system, and dismantle several longstanding multilateral arms-control obligations.
世界各国政府可以采取谨慎有力的行动有效应对影响水资源安全的自然限制和不确定性，确保本国民众和国内经济为应对未来的形势做好准备。	With strong and prudent action, governments around the world can cope effectively with the natural limitations and uncertainties affecting water resources, ensuring that their people and economies are prepared for what might lie ahead.
坎布里奇—本月，欧盟将迎来其创始条约 — — 罗马条约签订60周年。 罗马条约建立了欧洲经济共同体。	CAMBRIDGE – This month the European Union will celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding treaty, the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community.
发自哥本哈根 — — 随着冬天的临近，居住在中东欧地区的人们又会再度回忆起去年冬天因俄罗斯故意停止天然气供应而带来的森森寒意。	COPENHAGEN – As winter approaches, many people in Central and Eastern Europe remember the chill caused last winter by Russia’s deliberate cut-off of gas supplies.
毕竟，通过立法的变革需要政治勇气 — — 而这正是本届印度政府严重欠缺的 — — 但司法途径不会受到这些考虑的妨碍。	After all, whereas change via legislation would require political courage – a quality sorely lacking in the current Indian government – the judiciary is not hampered by such considerations.
有了国会的支持和促增长政策，波多黎各就能够吸引有才华的美国人（和合法移民）来到岛上创办公司，努力工��。	With congressional support and pro-growth policies, Puerto Rico can attract talented Americans (and legal immigrants) to move to the island, start companies, and work hard.
随着那些陷入困境的商业银行变得越发厌恶风险，这些挣扎求存的消费者再也无法靠借债来偿还债务以及为当前的消费融资，于是消费停滞，又加剧了衰退。	With troubled commercial banks more risk-averse, these struggling consumers could no longer borrow to roll over their debt and finance current consumption, which came to a halt, deepening the recession.
2005年联合国五十周年纪念日的时候，科菲·安南曾试图调整我们这个世界的多边体制，以使其适应新的现实。	Kofi Annan, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the United Nations in 2005, attempted to adjust the multilateral institutions of our world to fit its new realities.
上述新品种为全世界农场“带来了极为显著的净经济效益 ， 《 兰德斯生物科学》最新报告显示2012年经济效益达188亿美元，而从1996到2012年合计达到1，166亿美元之多。	Worldwide, these new varieties have provided “very significant net economic benefits at the farm level, amounting to $18.8 billion in 2012 and $116.6 billion” from 1996 to 2012, according to a recent report by Landes Bioscience.
在过去三年中，我们在印度北方邦进行了全球最大规模的产妇-新生儿健康实验，以观察我们是否能够通过改善基层医疗机构的看护质量来降低死亡率。	For the last three years, we ran one of the world’s largest maternal-newborn health trials in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to see if we could reduce deaths by improving the quality of care in frontline facilities.
左右两翼的民粹主义政党 — — 两者一样敌视自由贸易，移民，穆斯林和全球化 — — 在整个欧洲都更受欢迎。	Populist parties of the left and right – with their shared hostility to free trade, migration, Muslims, and globalization – are becoming more popular throughout Europe.
这无疑都是很有趣的问题，但不应该因为这些问题而分散了对更重要议题的注意力 — — 比特币推动金融部门创新的潜力。	These are certainly interesting questions, but they are diverting attention from far more important discussions about Bitcoin’s potential to drive financial-sector innovation.
如果我们主要关注的就是如何避免地球气温升高的话，就应对拥有这个如此简单、高性价比且前景如此清晰的方法感到兴高采烈才对。	If we care most about avoiding warmer temperatures, it seems that we should be elated that this simple, cost-effective approach shows so much promise.
虽然对历史的记忆并不总是像上面这个小故事那样颠倒黑白。 不过国际政治和外交场上却充斥着许多错误和被误解的历史案例，人们用这些例子来评价自己的外交政策决策，而这种行为也总能为此后的巨大灾难埋下伏笔。	Historical memory is not always quite as bad as this. But international politics and diplomacy are riddled with examples of bad and ill-considered precedents being used to justify foreign policy decisions, invariably leading to catastrophe.
而作为伊斯兰共和国的领袖，阿亚图拉赛义德·阿里·哈梅内伊公开对伊朗革命自卫队窃取总统选举结果的决定表示赞成。	The leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blessed the Revolutionary Guards’ decision to steal the presidential election.
他承认自己曾经是反犹太人的，但他声称上帝开启了他的慧眼，因而他现在对犹太人的爱与曾对他们的恨一样深。	He admitted that he had been anti-Semitic, but he claimed that God had opened his eyes and that he now loved Jews as much as he used to hate them.
事实上，尽管该举动或许强化了伊朗自称为耶路撒冷和巴勒斯坦守护神的定位，但对其最大的收益可能只是情绪而已。	And, in fact, while the move has probably reinforced Iran’s claim to be the true defender of Jerusalem and Palestine, the biggest gains for Iran will likely be emotional.
除非英国脱欧谈判取得令人意外的突破，在未来催生出一套服务和商品的自由贸易体制，否则金融活动将大量转移到欧洲大陆和爱尔兰。	Unless there is a surprising breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations, which produces a future free-trade regime for both services and goods, a substantial relocation of financial activity to the continent, and to Ireland, will occur over time.
这可能涉及向公众和创新者提供科学信息，并支持公私伙伴关系去试验，展示和应用相关研究成果，从而创造一批专门应对公共问题的就业岗位。	This could involve making scientific information accessible to the general public and innovators, and supporting public-private partnerships to pilot, demonstrate, and apply research outcomes, thereby creating jobs addressing public problems.
政府的考虑不周的干预 — — 特别是美国政府支持的按揭承销商房利美和房地美，以及社区再投资法（Community Reinvestment Act ） — —扭曲了市场激励。	Their ill-conceived interventions – notably the US-backed mortgage underwriters Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as the Community Reinvestment Act – distorted market incentives.
但对唐纳德·特朗普赢得美国总统竞选的一个可能的解读是如今选民更多地关注“真性情”而不是“勇于担当 ” 。	But one possible reading of Donald Trump’s victory in the United States presidential election is that voters these days care less about responsibility than “authenticity.”
他们显然相信上述策略已经取得了成果 — — 其中最显而易见的是美俄在7月达成的脆弱的叙利亚停火协议。	They evidently believe that this approach has yielded results – most notably the fragile Syrian ceasefire that the US and Russia brokered in July.
它们将被迫忍受高通胀，将其作为迫使投资者转向实体资产的办法以加速去杠杆化以及作为促进真实工资和房价向下调整的机制。	They will be driven to tolerate higher inflation as a means of forcing investors into real assets, to accelerate deleveraging, and as a mechanism for facilitating downward adjustment in real wages and home prices.
布什对此也要负一定责任，或者说，正是因为他首任内在鼓励效率和控制成本的医疗开支政策上几乎无所作为才导致了今天这种局面。	This is also partly Bush’s doing, or, rather, not doing, as his first-term policy on health spending was to do virtually nothing to encourage efficiency and cost containment.
石油收入像该地区其他国家一样，并未被有效地转化为人力资本、基础设施和推动生产力增长及多样化经济行为所需的创新能力。	Oil revenues, as is the case elsewhere in the region, were not efficiently transformed into human capital, infrastructure, and the innovative capacity needed to generate productivity growth and diversify economic activity.
各国应放松他们当前低效的气候政策，转而增加投入绿色研发。 只有创新才能让未来的绿色能源价格低于化石燃料，从而推动所有人改弦更张。	Countries should ease up on their current, inefficient climate policies and instead increase spending on green R&D. Only innovation can shift the price of future green energy below fossil fuels, thereby impelling everyone to switch.
如今，银行很愿意将资金存在美联储赚取0.25%的利息，��为这一利息是无风险的，具有完全流动性，并且没有资本要求负担。	The banks are now content to leave those funds at the Fed, where they earn a mere 0.25% because they are risk-free, completely liquid, and unburdened by capital requirements.
那些庞大到不能被重组的银行知道他们可以毫无顾忌地赌博 — — 因为美联储提供利率几乎为零的资金，而资金可以源源不断地提供。	The too-big-to-be-restructured banks know that they can gamble with impunity – and, with the Federal Reserve making funds available at near-zero interest rates, there are ample funds to do so.
与此同时，宗教和政治领袖必须大声谴责滋生了圣战运动的暴力伊斯兰意识形态，向对待挑战他们自身权威的人那样对待这些意识形态。	At the same time, religious and political leaders must loudly condemn the violent Islamist ideology that nurtures jihadist movements, spurning them with the same vigor that they reserve for challengers to their own authority.
这些技术让我们能够记录和追踪产品 — — 甚至是钱本身 — — 的生命周期，从而精确了解它们如何使用，如何融资，对环境造成什么影响。	Such technologies enable us to record and trace the lifecycle of products – even money itself – thereby determining precisely how they were used, how they were financed, and what impact they had on the environment.
但在当今分布式社交媒体当道的时代，驻外记者成了稀罕物，媒体“影响力”更像是流行明星，而不是政策专家。	But in today’s distributed social-media environment, foreign correspondents are rare, and media “influencers” are more likely to be pop stars than policy wonks.
比如，加大农转医（farm-to-hospital）和农转学（farm-to-school）计划的投资能够确保居民形成更加健康的饮食习惯，加强地方经济，减少肉奶行业的气候影响。	For example, higher investment in farm-to-hospital and farm-to-school programs would ensure healthier diets for residents, strengthen local economies, and reduce the climate impact of the meat and dairy industries.
政府留心这些抱怨大有裨益（事实上，可以和它们在市政厅的网上化身互动 ） ， 因为公民骚乱可能破坏积极势头 — — 不仅仅对于城市，也对于整个全球经济。	Governments would do well to heed these complaints (indeed, to engage with them in these hi-tech incarnations of a town-hall meeting), because civil unrest could disrupt the positive momentum, not only in cities, but in the entire global economy.
比如，在法国为欧洲宪法而举行的公民公决中 ， “ 波兰水暖工”成为了欧洲一体化将会对法国工人的生活水准带来威胁的一个象征。	For example, during the referendum campaign in France for the European constitution, the “Polish plumber” became a symbol of the threat that European integration was supposed to pose to French workers’ standards of living.
但在2014年10月一家孟买医院的开业典礼上，他宣称印度教象头神（Ganesh）证明了古印度便已掌握整形手术。	But, at the inauguration of a Mumbai hospital in October 2014, he claimed that the elephant-headed Hindu god Ganesh was proof of ancient India’s knowledge of plastic surgery.
而委员会的盲目源于这样一个事实，它更多地依赖于对其认为处于或超过“​​充分就业”的劳动力市场的评估，而不是纷繁的每月通货膨胀数据。	The FOMC’s blind spot stems from the fact that it is relying more on its assessment of the labor market, which it considers to be at or above “full employment,” than on noisy month-to-month inflation data.
1997—2012年间，三分之二的美国行业经历了市场集中度升高，创纪录的74%的员工在历史悠久（16年或以上）的老牌企业工作。	Between 1997 and 2012, two-thirds of America’s industries experienced an increase in market concentration, and a record 74% of employees are working at these aging (16 years or older) incumbents.
“民主”一词来自古希腊语，你也可以在希腊哲学中找到民主思想的核心要素，但这一事实并不意味着民主只存在于西方政治DNA中。	The fact that the word “democracy” derives from ancient Greek, and that one can discern the kernel of democratic thought in Greek philosophy, by no means implies that democracy is embedded in the West’s political DNA.
危机爆发之初对全球一致监管标准的热情已经变成了各自为政的国家监管政策，这些政策受国内政治日程推动，毫不顾及跨国兼容性。	The early post-crisis enthusiasm for new, globally agreed regulatory standards has given way to a range of national initiatives, driven by domestic political agendas, with little regard for cross-border compatibility.
通过把这些细节结构数据与不完全光线和电子显微镜布线图相结合，就可能建立现实统计模型而不必尝试完整地重建大脑。	By combining these detailed structural data with the incomplete light and electron microscopy wiring diagrams, it could be possible to generate a realistic statistical model, rather than attempting to reconstruct the brain in its entirety.
最后，两人都亲美，中曾根康弘宣布日本是美国在东亚“不沉的航空母舰 ” ， 小泉则向伊拉克派兵支持美国为首的战争行动。	Finally, both are pro-American, with Nakasone declaring Japan to be America’s “unsinkable aircraft carrier” in East Asia and Koizumi sending troops to Iraq in support of the United States-led war effort.
旨在散播某类信息的机器人程序大肆转发上述指控 — — 给人留下的印象是很多民众都在严肃探讨“比萨门 ” 。	The allegations were frequently retweeted by bots – programs designed to spread certain types of messages – contributing to the impression that many people were taking “Pizzagate” seriously.
最后时刻就美国债务上限达成一致并使政府重新开门让共和党极端分子处于不利地位，而总统奥巴马则拥有了优势。	The last-minute agreement to raise the US debt ceiling and reopen the government has left Republican Party extremists in a weakened position, while President Barack Obama has emerged strengthened.
近年来在大陆周围设立海洋保护区的建议已经被纳入考虑，目的是防止各种鱼及鲸类数量日益减少甚至彻底灭绝。	In recent years, proposals have been considered that would establish marine reserves around the continent and end the risk of growing scarcity, or the outright disappearance, of a variety of species of fish and cetaceans.
如果美国人对住宅的需求重新上扬而企业又想增加投资的话，那么中国的低储蓄率和美国继续存在的高财政赤字之间将发生冲突，并导致全球利率大幅上升。	If Americans’ demand for housing picks up and businesses want to increase their investment, a clash between China’s lower saving rate and a continued high fiscal deficit in the US could drive up global interest rates significantly.
“技能溢价”的概念 — — 熟练工和非熟练工之间的工资差 — — 表明，更高的教育水平应该带来更高的薪酬和更安全的“饭碗 ” 。	The concept of a “skills premium” – the difference in wages between skilled and unskilled workers – dictates that higher educational attainment should lead to higher compensation and more secure employment.
总理默克尔已成为以色列国的坚定捍卫者，她2008年在以色列议会的演讲便是明证 — — 在这次演讲中，她将以色列的安全列为德国“国家理性 ” （ Staatsraison）的关键要素。	Chancellor Angela Merkel has emerged as a staunch defender of the country, exemplified in a 2008 address to the Knesset (Israel’s parliament), in which she identified Israel’s security as an essential feature of Germany’s Staatsraison.
只有当更多的父母、教师和社会领袖以这样的方式行动起来，才能令恐怖分子的来源枯竭，执法部门才能获得民众的全力配合。	Only when more parents, teachers, and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police.
外国投资者将帮助支持本地社区，让它们能够生产满足本地消费的食品和服务，而不是像经常发生的那样取代它们。	Foreign investors would work in support of local communities, enabling them to produce food and services for local consumption, rather than displacing them, as is so often the case.
但面对俄国坚定不移的帝国重振政策 ， （ 现在在高加索也已清晰可见）美国似乎未能察觉全球事态发展的联系因素。	But, confronted with a resolute Russian policy of imperial re-assertion, now also visible in the Caucasus, the US seems unable to see how global developments are linked.
但推动会议的最强大力量来自基督教占主导地位的南方，那里的政界人士担心身为南方基督教信徒的奥巴桑乔2007年完成自己的第二个任期后，权力会最终落到被穆斯林势力占据的北方。	But the most powerful push for the conference came from politicians in the largely Christian south, apprehensive that power would return to the Muslim north in 2007 after Obasanjo, himself a southern Christian, completed his second term.
类似地，中国政府承诺在五年内每年投入6,400亿欧元给包括信息和通讯技术在内的七大“战略性新兴产业 ” 。	"Similarly, the Chinese government has committed €640 billion annually for five years to just seven “strategic emerging industries,"" including information and communications technology."
私人部门的杠杆降低了，而公共部门的杠杆已经触及（并超过）了可持续的最大规模，希腊只是一个较极端的例子。	Private-sector leverage declined and public-sector leverage reached – and exceeded – sustainable limits, with Greece being only the most extreme example.
很难预测未来国会会怎么做，但我很难相信大部分议员会支持退休金水平降低21%或雇主和所有雇员支付的工资税增加26 % 。	While it is hard to predict what a future Congress will do, I find it hard to believe that a majority would vote to reduce the level of benefits by 21% or to increase the level of the payroll tax paid by all employers and all employees by 26%.
这一决策模式的出发点是气候变化忍受极限，根据确定的边界计算2050年之前世界仍然可以排放的规模，然后再分配给193个联合国成员。	This policy-making model begins with the limit for tolerable climate change; the world’s remaining emissions budget until 2050 is calculated from the agreed boundary, then divided among the 193 UN member states.
在英国，最大的服务业出口是贸易专家所谓的“专业、科学和技术服务 ” ， 这意味着需要训练、吸引和留住全世界最好的专家。	In the UK, where the largest service exports are in what trade specialists describe as “professional, scientific, and technical services,” this implies the need to train, attract, and retain the world’s best experts.
但皮奥特的行为不应被视为波兰政治斗争中的一场演出，也不应被随意当做反对法律与正义党或其他任何人的理由。	But Piotr’s act should not be made a spectacle in Poland’s political fight, or wielded haphazardly as a blunt object against the PiS or anyone else.
随着和平方案和特使们像走马灯似的换了又换，以色列和巴勒斯坦人都开始对达成最终解决方案的可能性感到厌倦了，就连两国分治方案也迅速失去了吸引力。	With peace plans and envoys coming and going, Israelis and Palestinians alike have finally become blasé about the chances of a final settlement. The two-state solution is rapidly losing its appeal.
举行这一选举的原因是由于目前当政的正义和发展党指定外交部长居尔为其总统候选人之时，该国的世俗势力大为不快。	This election is taking place because when the AKP party, the conservative party now in power, designated Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as its candidate for president, the country’s secular elite cringed.
2003年，小布什总统发动了入侵和占领伊拉克的战争，美国军事支出也达到了危机水平 — — 这是一个分水岭事件，它给美国的国际形象造成了不可挽回的伤害。	It reached crisis levels with the 2003 US-led invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq under President George W. Bush – a watershed moment that caused irreparable damage to America’s international standing.
首先是惰性，也可能是理想主义情怀 — — 例如认为网络不仅应该自由浏览，而且应该完全免费。 为了人们安全的使用网络，一些必要的费用支出也是应该的。	The first is inertia, combined with (or disguised as) idealism – the mistaken idea that the Internet should be free not just for speech, but also from payment. Yet it costs something to maintain an infrastructure that keeps people safe.
由此造成的政策困境 — — 不平等性加剧、波动增加、管理实体经济的空间被挤压 — — 将在未来几十年中一直成为决策者的难题。	The policy dilemmas that have resulted – rising inequality, greater volatility, reduced room to manage the real economy – will continue to preoccupy policymakers in the decades ahead.
土耳其人、英国人、非殖民化、冷战、多任美国总统，甚至更多的国际调停人士来了又去，可是这一冲突的各种特征，以及找不到解决办法的困窘，似乎从未改变过。	The Ottomans, the British, decolonization, the Cold War, numerous American Presidents, and even more international mediators have come and gone, but the parameters of this conflict and the inability to find a solution never seem to change.
随着他们参与投资，当代艺术市场里的常客并非纯粹地依靠自己的判断，他们同时也依靠高端顾问和经纪人团队，这些顾问和经纪人可以提供咨询告诉人们什么样趋势最能抓住的时代的精神。	As with their investments, the habitués of contemporary art markets relied not purely on their own judgment, but on teams of sophisticated advisers and dealers who could give opinions on what trends best caught the spirit of the age.
鉴于鲨鱼通常为（针对金枪鱼）捕捞作业的具有商业价值的次级渔业捕获物，地区渔业管理组织往往不特别规定针对鲨鱼的捕捞细则。	Given that sharks are a commercially valuable secondary catch of fisheries (usually those targeting tuna), regional fisheries management organizations tend not to elaborate specific regulations for them.
为了实现这一目标，它们正积极的和它们的北部邻国进行讨论，并且依靠莫桑比克、南非和斯威士兰之间非常成功的伙伴关系模式的创新性跨区域合作也正在发展之中。	To do so, they are in active discussions with their northern neighbors, and innovative cross-border collaborations are being developed, building on the model of the highly successful partnership between Mozambique, South Africa, and Swaziland.
好消息是，随着一系列令人印象深刻的新模式的实施，我们正在获得关于如何制定、融资和扩大未来早教项目的经验。	The good news is that, with an impressive array of new models being implemented, important lessons are emerging about how to shape, finance, and scale future early education programs.
塔蒂亚娜坚持认为贝阿铁路的建设始于1974年，这个日期相当政治正确，因为自那以后都使用的都是“清白劳工 ” 。	Tatiana insisted that BAM construction was started in 1974, the politically correct date, after which “clean labor” was used.
如果银行在出问题时可以轻松解决，损失可以公平地分担，那么监管者可以更爽快地允许它们继续在全球开展高效经营。	If banks can be wound up easily when things go wrong, with losses equitably distributed, regulators can more easily allow them to continue to operate globally and efficiently.
但全世界人口最多的两个民主国家的领导人最终取得了丰硕的成果，彰显出外交在将挑战转变为机遇方面的巨大作用。	Yet the leaders of the world’s two most populous democracies ended up making important headway, demonstrating the power of diplomacy to transform challenges into opportunities.
他信如日中天之时，许多人认为他是马来西亚前总理马哈蒂尔优秀的继承人，其地位依靠国内的专制统治以及在国际上发挥当仁不让的领导作用来得以维持。	At his zenith, many saw Thaksin as a worthy successor to former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, buoyed by authoritarian rule at home and assertive leadership abroad.
El llamado del Papa a la libertad de culto en todo el mundo, incluidos los países socialistas, cayó mal a los ateos soviéticos (y a los rusos ortodoxos ) .	The Pope’s call for religious freedom around the world, including in the socialist countries, rubbed the atheistic Soviets – and Orthodox Russians – the wrong way.
她不仅仔细研究了杰奎琳·肯尼迪 — — 将她的紧身裙装、船形衣领以及发尾内卷的发型和杰奎琳·肯尼迪进行对比，就可以明显地看出这一点 — — 而且还研究了另一个富有魅力但是被低估了的隐形激进分子黛安娜王妃成功和失败的地方。	She has carefully studied not only Jackie Kennedy – a comparison obvious from her sheath dresses, boat collars, and page-boy haircut – but also the triumphs and failures of that other glamorous but underestimated stealth radical, Princess Diana.
与此同时，钻井和开采平台的技术发展也日新月异，但随着便于开采的油井已经被开采完毕，人们所面临的深度、气候和沉积物构造等方面的难题也更加棘手。	Meanwhile, the technology used at drilling and production platforms has developed tremendously, but the challenges regarding depth, weather, and sediment structure have grown even more, as easy-to-exploit oil fields have been exhausted.
美国应该支持国际货币基金组织推进石油货币和美元脱钩的幕后努力，而不应该像鲍尔森那样推进这些货币盯住美元。	Instead of promoting dollar pegs, as Paulson is, the US should be supporting the International Monetary Fund’s behind-the-scenes efforts to promote de-linking of oil currencies and the dollar.
但所有指标均未考虑到研发、技术创新和商业化等因素，而目前这些因素与核武库或经济规模相比更能反应出未来的成功。	But all of these metrics fail to account for factors like research and development, technological innovation, and commercialization, which are now more indicative of future success than nuclear arsenals or economic size.
“信用动荡 ” — —特别是贸易融资信用 — — 毫无疑问是金融危机导致实体经济衰退的一个关键因素。	A “credit crunch” – particularly in trade finance – was certainly a key reason why the financial crisis generated a real economy recession.
在发展中国家，以进口替代作为经济多样化的启动手段可以在短期内见效，但假以时日，随着生产率增长的落后和比较优势弱化，增长会陷入停滞。	In developing countries, import substitution as a way to jump-start economic diversification can work for a while; but, over time, as productivity growth lags and comparative advantage is over-ridden, growth grinds to a halt.
尽管达成实质性和解一直是一个遥远的梦，但最新的失望结果意味着美国连为这一其实一点都不和平的进程保留“和平进程”的外表也无法做到。	Though achieving a substantive settlement was always a pipe dream, this latest disappointment will render the United States unable to preserve even the façade of a “peace process” that was all process and no peace.
艾伦最著名、最成功的影片之一、1979年发行的《曼哈顿 》 （ Manhattan）讲述的便是一个中年男子（艾伦）和一位年轻女孩之间的关系。 女孩的扮演者是玛丽尔·海明威（Mariel Hemingway ） ， 拍摄影片时只有16岁。	One of Allen’s best known and most successful films, “Manhattan,” released in 1979, when he was in his forties, featured a relationship between a middle-aged man (Allen) and a young girl, played by Mariel Hemingway, who was 16 at the time of filming.
今天的美国不仅有红州（保守派）和蓝州（进步派 ） ， 事实上还有红国和蓝国之分，两者之间的文化、英雄、政治、话语、经济和自由的概念相去甚远。	America today doesn’t just have red (conservative) states and blue (progressive) states, but de facto red countries and blue countries, that is, distinct regions with distinct cultures, heroes, politics, dialects, economies, and ideas of freedom.
在被问及赫鲁晓夫为什么会被剥夺权力时，俄罗斯政坛“不倒翁”安德烈·葛罗米柯（Andrei Gromyko）据说打趣道 ， “ 赫鲁晓夫是一个鲁莽的赌徒，还好我们守住了莫斯科 。 ”	When asked why Nikita Khrushchev was removed from power, the longtime Soviet politician Andrei Gromyko allegedly joked, “Khrushchev was so reckless a gambler, we would be lucky to hold on to Moscow.”
当可以债务要么被社会化，要么估值得到稳定并转移到了有能力充分承担风险的投资者手中时，金融危机就结束了。	A financial crisis ends when the doubtful debt either has been socialized, or its valuation has stabilized, and it has migrated to investors who are solvent enough to bear the risk.
他并未设定具体的收入目标，但可以肯定地说，他或许预期中国能有更好的表现：根据世界银行的标准，世纪之交的中国依然属于中低收入国家。	He did not set a specific income goal, but it is safe to say that he probably expected China to do better than it did: by World Bank standards, China at the turn of the century was a lower-middle-income country.
同样，在去年一项撤销德克萨斯禁止同性性行为的法令的裁决中，高院也引用了1967年《英国议会法案》和欧洲人权法庭在1981年的一项裁决。	Likewise, in last year's ruling striking down a Texas prohibition on same-sex sodomy, the Court cited a 1967 Act of the English Parliament and a 1981 ruling of the European Court of Human Rights.
约翰内斯堡—坦桑尼亚建国总统朱利乌斯·尼雷尔曾说 ， “ 联合”无法让非洲变富，但“可以让非洲和非洲人民不再那么容易被轻视、被屈辱 。 ”	JOHANNESBURG – Julius Nyerere, the founding president of Tanzania, once said that “unity” will not make Africa rich, but “it can make it difficult for Africa and the African peoples to be disregarded and humiliated.”
我在坦桑尼亚农村社区工作了三年，帮助南方高地（Southern Highlands）的村庄根据本地环境采取我们的贫困指标解决水、卫生和电气化需求。	In Tanzania, where I worked for three years in rural communities, we helped villages in the Southern Highlands adapt our poverty indicators to the local context in order to tackle water, sanitation, and electrification needs.
瑞士的四个邻国排名要低得多 — — 德国位列第十五、奥地利第十七、法国第二十、意大利第三十二 — — 尽管这些国家都与瑞士有着密切的文化、历史和商业联系。	Switzerland’s four neighbors languish far lower on the list – Germany in 15th place; Austria in 17th; France in 20th; and Italy in 32nd – despite their close cultural, historical, and commercial ties to Switzerland.
这场行动所造成的直接影响则在于巴基斯坦当局决心要在当地重新树立自己的管治权威，然而留给巴军来填补这一权力真空的时机却也相当短暂，因为恐怖分子过去的行动已经证明，这些人随时可能发动突袭，组织反击，甚至重建其恐怖网络。	The campaign’s immediate impact consists in Pakistan’s determination to establish its authority in the area. But the window for the military to fill the power vacuum will be open only briefly.
事实上，缺少能达成共识的强大统一的政府可能导致连哈梅内伊都无法改变方向，并因此导致伊朗别无选择只能延续与西方的外交僵局。	Indeed, the lack of a strong, unified government capable of shaping a consensus could make it impossible even for Khamenei to change course, leaving Iran no choice but to persist in its diplomatic standoff with the West.
如果我们能够培育对人类多样性更大的宽容，那么，政治人物、商界领导人以及行政官员将会不再如此惧怕“曝光 ” ， 因为他们将会认识到他们并没有做什么必须隐瞒的事情。	If we can cultivate a wider tolerance of human diversity, politicians, business leaders, and administrators would be less fearful of “exposure,” because they would realize that they have done nothing that they must hide.
毫无疑问，行为最恶劣的要数美国共和党人，其领导人在某种程度上已经被一些其他发达国家无法存在的理念所迷惑。	Without question, the worst offenders are America’s Republicans, whose leaders have somehow become enraptured by ideas that are beyond the pale in other advanced countries.
俄国首位民主总理盖达尔领导的自由俄罗斯选择党在1993年大选中赢得了15.5%的选票，并和盟友一道成为杜马的主要力量。	The liberal Russia’s Choice party, led by the country’s first democratic prime minister, Yegor Gaidar, received 15.5% of the vote in the 1993 general election, and with its allies formed the largest bloc in the Duma.
即使能够实现无缝转型，世界银行仍面临着艰苦的内部斗争，需要战胜根深蒂固的官僚利益和无处不在的过度厌恶风险、过度注重过程而非结果的制度思维。	Even if this transition occurs seamlessly, the Bank faces a serious internal struggle against entrenched bureaucratic interests and a pervasive institutional mindset that is overly risk-averse and fixates on processes rather than outcomes.
这就是NCD的悖论：不健康程度的客观标准（严重症状、残疾、过早死亡）在下降，尽管这些疾病的普遍性在上升。	This is the paradox of NCDs: objective measures of poor health (severe symptoms, disability, premature death) are declining, even as the prevalence of these diseases is increasing.
虽然中国在核武器和兵员数量方面占据优势，但日本军队在某些领域装备更为精良（而且显然拥有快速研发核武器的技术力量 ） 。	While China has nuclear weapons and more soldiers, Japan’s military is better equipped in some areas (and obviously has the technological capacity to develop nuclear weapons very quickly).
今年夏天，卡拉奇国际机场、某海军基地遭遇袭击，印巴边界的居民还目睹了双方军队集结对峙。 白沙瓦大屠杀是第四个困难。	Following this summer’s attacks on Karachi’s international airport, a naval base, and a crowd gathered on the India-Pakistan border to witness a popular display of force by each side’s guards, the Peshawar massacre makes it four.
而以色列-巴勒斯坦和平进程长期以来的一个基本点是巴勒斯坦人行使民族自决权只能在1967年前边界之外的另一个国家中。	And the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has long been based on the principle that the Palestinians should exercise their right of national self-determination in a separate state on the other side of the pre-1967 borders.
其分界线可能不如种族隔离政策清晰，但我们持续的高水平温室气体排放量保护的是一个群体的人口 — — 活在世上的丰裕人口 — — 的利益，而受害的是其他群体。	The dividing lines may be less sharp than they were with apartheid, but our continued high level of greenhouse-gas emissions protects the interests of one group of humans – mainly affluent people who are alive today – at the cost of others.
在这个更有利的背景下，中国人民银行不应再炮制出一些增添不必要复杂性的新利率制定规则，而是需要重新回到改革的道路之上。	In this more favorable context, the PBOC, rather than churning out unnecessarily complicated new rate-setting rules, needs to return to reform.
比如，可以给予本地富豪投资创业者的激励，同时政府可以提供低息贷款，并允许创业企业达到某个利润阈值后再开始还款。	Wealthy locals, for example, could be given incentives to invest in start-ups, while the government could provide low-interest loans and defer repayment until a particular profit threshold is reached.
八月份，那里的温度比周围的农村高出12.5℃，达到了40℃。 这种灼热的温度不仅影响了闹市区，还覆盖了大约8000平方公里的范围。	In August, temperatures there climbed 12.5oC above the surrounding countryside, reaching 40oC – a scorching heat that affected not only the downtown area, but also covered some 8,000 square kilometers.
今天的另一大不同之处是许多企业都是全球价值链的一部分。 在全球价值链中，墨西哥和中国进口商品零部件进行组装，其中最先进的零部件往往来自美国。	Another major difference today is that many firms are a part of global value chains, whereby goods are assembled in countries like Mexico or China from imported components, the most sophisticated of which often come from the US.
鉴于与气候变化相关的金融风险不断扩大，抵制特朗普撤销华尔街透明度规则的行政命令应当成为我们的首要任务。	Given the heightened financial risks associated with climate change, resisting Trump’s executive order to roll back Wall Street transparency regulations should be a top priority.
美国的新问题是长期失业，如今这一问题影响着近40%的失业者，而美国的失业保险又是发达国家中最差的，失业救济通常只能领26周。	America’s new problem is long-term unemployment, which affects nearly 40% of those without jobs, compounded by one of the poorest unemployment-insurance systems among advanced countries, with benefits normally expiring after 26 weeks.
通过商业仲裁 - - -然后法院有义务去执行仲裁做出的决定，从而来使投资者安心，但法院通常情况下不会这样去做。	Commercial arbitration – and courts’ obligations to enforce the arbitrators’ decisions – can assure investors, even if the courts generally do not.
如果随着外交倡议的进展，美国继续采取旁观态度，只在幕后参与讨论并最终任由欧洲为所欲为的话，那么欧洲没有足够的实力采取进一步的行动。	It is not enough for the Europeans to act while the Americans continue to look on as the diplomatic initiatives unfold, partaking in discussion only behind the scenes and ultimately letting the Europeans do what they will.
在这个故事里没有英雄，阿根廷决策者显然不是，十年前他们试图单方面强行对外国债券持有人实施大规模的一般化减记。	There are no heroes in this story, certainly not Argentina’s policymakers, who a decade ago attempted unilaterally to force a massive generalized write-down on foreign bondholders.
比约恩·隆姆博格，哥本哈根共识中心的主任，是哥本哈根商学院兼职教授，著有《怀疑主义环保分子并请冷静：怀疑主义环保分子之全球变暖指南 》 。	That our profligate consumption requires five planets is a catchy story, but it is wrong. The planet we have is more than enough.
在中国和印度，煤炭占到总发电量的80%之多，它们帮助中国和印度的劳工过上了他们的父辈难以想象的高质量生活。	In China and India, it accounts for about 80% of power generation, and is helping Chinese and Indian laborers enjoy a quality of life that their parents could barely imagine.
问题在于卡尔扎伊拒绝签署好不容易谈成的关于2014年后美国-北约阿富汗任务的双边安全协议，导致奥巴马别无选择，只能启动备选计划。	The problem is that Karzai has refused to sign a painstakingly negotiated bilateral security agreement governing a post-2014 US-NATO mission in Afghanistan, leaving Obama with little choice but to begin contingency planning.
我们应当从华盛顿互惠银行和占领运动上吸取教训，而这两件事的教训其实是一样的：金融寡头势力就是一个不断发放好处的善人 — — 只不过受益者不是你罢了。	We should learn from both the WaMu and the Occupy movement. In both cases, the lesson is the same: concentrated financial power is a gift that keeps on giving – but not to you.
西方的反全球化民粹主义逆袭不会因为马克龙的胜利而戛然而止，仍然可能导致保护主义、贸易战和激烈的移民限制。	The populist backlash against globalization in the West will not be stilled by Macron’s victory, and could still lead to protectionism, trade wars, and sharp restrictions to migration.
从对可再生能源和弹性燃料（flex-fuel ）车辆的投资到植树造林增加绿化，世界各国都认识到环保不是一个选择，而是刺激其经济并且创造几百万工作岗位所必需的。	From investments in renewable energy and flex-fuel vehicles to reforestation, countries everywhere are realizing that green is not an option, but a necessity for recharging their economies and creating millions of jobs.
主办城市从其国际电视转播合同分成（大约为25 % ， 其余75%归国际奥委会 ） 、 国际和国内赞助、门票销售以及纪念品销售中获得的总收入为35—45亿美元。	The total revenue for the host city from its share of international television contracts (roughly 25%, with the other 75% going to the IOC), international and domestic sponsorships, ticket sales, and memorabilia is $3.5-4.5 billion.
但是强调对女性伴侣竞争的进化心理学可以为我们对这些现象的理解增加另一个维度，同时帮助我们预测内乱可能爆发的时间和地点。	But evolutionary psychology, which stresses competition for females, can add another dimension to our understanding of these phenomena, while helping us to predict when and where civil strife might erupt.
他们可以随着治疗的进展而继续跟踪检查资金，他们的数据可以纳入医疗记录，提供对他们健康状况的长期检视，而不是在就医当日进行插入式拍片。	They can continue to track themselves as their treatments progress, and their data can be integrated with medical records to provide a long-term view of their health, rather than an episodic snapshot of the day they visit a doctor.
北京—在一年一度的人大会议开幕时，温家宝总理宣布，中国政府2012年的年经济增长目标为7.5 % 。	BEIJING – At the opening of the annual session of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), Premier Wen Jiabao announced that the government’s target for annual economic growth in 2012 was 7.5%.
仅德国一地每年就需多支出超过30亿美元，合每吨二氧化碳减排多支出167美元，超过了欧盟排放交易系统碳减排定价的37倍。	Germany alone spends more than $3 billion annually, or $167 per ton of avoided CO2 emissions, which is more than 37 times the cost of carbon reductions in the European Union Emissions Trading System.
他们是一个渠道，资金和隐性知识可以通过这条渠道流动；他们也是贸易、投资、创新和专业网络机会的潜在源泉。	They are a channel through which not only money, but also much tacit knowledge, can flow, and they are a potential source of opportunities for trade, investment, innovation, and professional networks.
但就像不可救药的吸毒者一样，他们不具备说出“够了，我们犯了错误，必须在还来得及的时候加以纠正”的能力。	But, like an incorrigible drug addict, they are unable to say, “Enough. We have made a mistake, and we have to remedy it before it’s too late.”
事实上 ， “ 阿尔恰米分子”即来源于阿拉伯名字“阿尔恰米 ” ， 现在被用来代称什叶派，意指他们是变节者。	Indeed, “‘Alaqima,” the plural form of the Arabic name “‘Alqami,” is now applied to the Shia as short-hand for treachery.
不管以上的哪一种可能性出现，银行的实际资产都应该考虑到有毒资产的因素，这样银行才真正拥有足够的资本来扮演它的重要职能。	Either way, the true value of banks’ toxic assets must be estimated before concluding that banks are armed with sufficient capital to carry out their critical roles.
奥巴马援引确立于许多关于传统“正义战争”思想的讨论中的关键标准，称“这是一场合理的战争，是最后手段，也是自我防卫战争 。 ”	Referring to the key criteria set out in many discussions of traditional “just war” doctrine, he called it “a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.”
在1930年西班牙内战中，纳粹德国和意大利法西斯全力支持弗朗西斯科·弗朗哥（Francisco Franco）将军的叛乱，而民主国家则很不情愿给了西班牙共和国一点勉强的帮助。	In 1930’s Spain, of course, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy fully supported General Francisco Franco’s rebellion, while the democracies reluctantly offered scant help to the Spanish Republic.
支持派和反对派在人数上相差无几，并且很有可能会发生逆转，就像在六月那次公民复决的几周之前发生过的那样。	The gap between the Yes and No sides remains within the margin of error and could easily reverse itself, as it did in the weeks leading up to the June referendum.
整合一个由公路、内河、航空和海洋组成的强大的交通网络能产生层级效应，有助于优化供应链，从而带来巨大 — — 并且立竿见影 — — 的经济好处。	Consolidating a strong transport network of road, inner waterways, air, and sea would produce a cascading effect while offering significant – and immediate – economic gains by helping to optimize supply chains.
此外，在意大利等国家的比例选举制度（proportional voting system）中，通常无法产生单一的议会多数政党，总统往往需要行使任命总理的重要职责。	Moreover, in proportional voting systems like Italy’s, where no single political party normally wins a majority of seats in parliament, the president often plays a key role in appointing the prime minister.
美国有一些类似贸易调整援助计划这样的项目，为因进口商品冲击而失业的工人提供数额更加慷慨的失业救济金。	The US has policies like the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides more generous unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs because of competition from imports.
M-Pesa等移动支付系统正在改变肯尼亚、巴基斯坦和菲律宾等众多发展中国家人民转移、收取和储蓄资金的方式。	Mobile-payment systems like M-Pesa are changing how people transfer, receive, and save money in many developing countries, including Kenya, Pakistan, and the Philippines.
事实上，2012年，全球核电发电量前所未有地下降了7 % ， 超过了前一年创下的下降4%的记录，也使核电发电量较2006年的历史最高水平减少了12 % 。	Indeed, in 2012, annual nuclear generation worldwide dropped by an unprecedented 7%, exceeding the previous year’s record-breaking drop of 4% and bringing total annual nuclear-power generation to 12% below its historic maximum, achieved in 2006.
历史告诉我们，外交通常只有在强权的支持下才能带来结果。 这就是美国前总统、诺贝尔和平奖获得者西奥多·罗斯福的存在主义世界观。	History teaches that diplomacy all too frequently produces results only when backed by overwhelming power.
经验表明服务市场在这些方面的扭曲在国内生产总值中占到了三分之二的比重，这也是造成欧盟与美国生产率差距的主要原因。	Empirical evidence indicates that these distortions in the market for services, which account for about two thirds of GDP, underlie most of the EU's productivity gap with the United States.
想想它在竞争策略领域取得的可喜成绩：打破了企业联合、制止了国家补助，即便它们披着企业债务政府担保的欺骗性外衣也无处容身。	Think of the excellent work it has done in the area of competition policy: breaking up cartels and stopping state aid, even when it comes in disguised forms, such as government guarantees on company debt.
国有企业在国内的垄断或寡头垄断地位不再能够确保它们的竞争力，特别是在横跨国境的破坏性新技术的挑战下。	An SOE’s monopolistic or oligopolistic position at home no longer ensures its competitiveness, particularly in the context of disruptive new technologies that cross borders.
如今，几乎所有发达国家都饱受着总需求不足的折磨，并因此导致了高失业、低工资、不平等性恶化以及消费不足 — — 所有这些形成了一个完整的恶性循环。	Today, a deficiency of aggregate demand afflicts almost all advanced countries, leading to high unemployment, lower wages, greater inequality, and – coming full, vicious circle – constrained consumption.
因此随着时间的推移，财政账户自动走向恶化并形成恶性循环：财政赤字货币化导致平行双重汇率市场下的通货膨胀和贫富差距不断扩大，并使财政赤字进一步恶化。	So, over time, fiscal accounts worsen automatically, creating a vicious circle: monetized fiscal deficits lead to inflation and a widening gap in the parallel exchange-rate market which worsens the fiscal deficit.
北朝鲜在导弹试验后登上了议事日程，还有缅甸也因将军们坚持以无关紧要的理由起诉世界最著名的在押政治犯昂山素姬登上了议事榜单。	North Korea will be on the agenda after its missile tests, as will Myanmar, since its generals persist in prosecuting Aung San Suu Kyi, the world’s most famous political detainee, on trivial charges.
但许多人不知道天主教会对现代科学的支持，包括许多世界领先的天主教牧师在生物学、化学和物理学方面做出的重要贡献。	But many are unaware of the Church’s support for modern science, including many important contributions to biology, chemistry, and physics by world-leading Catholic clerics.
人们从事运动是为了社交、锻炼、保持身材、赚钱、成名、打发时间、寻找爱情或仅仅为了享受运动本身的乐趣。	People play sports to socialize, for exercise, to keep fit, to earn money, to become famous, to prevent boredom, to find love, and for the sheer fun of it.
而这一测量手段也同时凸显了当前问题的严峻性，因为目前二氧化碳含量已经达到了386ppm，并以每年2ppm的速度在不断增长。	It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already at 386 ppm, and is rising by two ppm each year.
这需要出资国不再短视且错误地认为民主刚果已经不可挽回，相反，它们应该帮助民主刚果构建民主刚果儿童理应得到的未来。	That will require donors to abandon their short-sighted and wrong-headed perceptions of the DRC as a lost cause, and instead help the country build the future that its children deserve.
那些曾经在伊朗生活的人尤其如此，那里虽然是纯而又纯的穆斯林环境，但却允许妇女自由地学习和工作，也可以享有充分的医疗和计划生育保障。	This is especially true for those who have lived in Iran, a totally Muslim environment that allows women the freedom to study and work as well as access to adequate healthcare and family planning.
根据格林斯潘的说法 ， “ 物价稳定是一种状态，在这种状态下，总体物价水平的预期变化不会有效改变企业和家庭决策 。 ”	According to Greenspan, “Price stability is that state in which expected changes in the general price level do not effectively alter business and household decisions.”
他能在外交政策上有效地制定策略，但却无法控制自身的不安全感，并最终导致了他的倒台 — — 这是一个经过一段时间之后才会浮现的弱点。	He was able to strategize effectively on foreign policy, but was less able to control the personal insecurities that eventually led to his downfall – a shortcoming that emerged only over time.
欧洲央行一直都尝试收拾南欧地区在推行欧元的最初一段时期形成的大量泡沫崩溃的残局，而这些政策只是这一系列尝试中的最新一项。	These policies are, in essence, the latest in a string of attempts by the ECB to address the fallout of the collapse of the massive bubble that formed in southern Europe in the early years of the euro.
比如，越南因为1954年法国在奠边府战败而分裂，随后，越南最后一任非共产党总统吴庭艳求助于美国的军事支持。	For example, following Vietnam’s partition in the wake of France’s defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Ngo Dinh Diem, Vietnam’s last non-Communist president, was able to turn to the US military for support.
事实上，美国金融市场拥有无与伦比的深度、流动性和安全性，这让它称为吸引全球资本的磁石，特别是在金融危机时期。	Indeed, American financial markets boast unparalleled depth, liquidity, and safety, making them magnets for global capital, especially in times of financial distress.
即使假设地产价格稳定，全球危机也必然会导致在外工作的非洲人士减少汇款。 这些人工作优渥，呆在欧洲，美国，加拿大，澳大利亚和中东。	Even assuming stability in real estate prices, the global crisis surely will cause a fall in remittances by Africans working good jobs in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia, and the Middle East.
但另一方面，迪克松接着说 ， “ 当政府对玛吉德做了一些‘机密’行为之时，那就意味着政府对玛吉德泄露了机密。	On the other hand, Dixon continued, “When the government does something to [Khan] that they say is classified, they have disclosed to him classified information.
此外，如果以色列继续保持其野蛮占领并继续在巴勒斯坦土地上建设定居点，这样的谈判也不太可能被视作公正。	Moreover, it is impossible for the negotiations to be seen as fair if Israel maintains its brutal occupation and continues to build settlements on Palestinian lands.
在这方面，由我担任协调员的非洲青年组织（Organisation of Africa Youth）不但与本地青年团体和社区网络合作；还从一份覆盖2,000名肯尼亚城镇和农村青年的GeoPoll调查中总结经验。	To that end, the Organisation of Africa Youth, of which I am coordinator, has not only worked with local youth groups and community networks; it has also taken lessons from a GeoPoll survey of 2,000 urban and rural Kenyan youth.
纽约－对我们当中长期以来声称国际金融体系需要进行深刻改革的人来说，布雷顿森林体系II的倡议是很受欢迎的。	NEW YORK – For those of us who have long claimed that the world’s international financial architecture needed deep reform, the call for a “Bretton Woods II” is welcome.
利用天生的魅力、煽动的言辞和挑拨建制派政客的敏锐感觉，他强行通过了西方历史上首个定期免费派发小麦的立法。	Using his natural charm, fiery rhetoric, and keen sense of how to play establishment politicians against each other, he rammed through legislation establishing the first regular handout of free grain in Western history.
1930年，在大萧条最恐怖时期，约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯称“渐进经济体”的生活水平将在今后一百年提升4-8倍。	In 1930, at the height of the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes declared that the standard of living in “progressive economies” would increase 4-8 times over the subsequent 100 years.
近几周来，艾哈迈迪内贾德的助手否定了另一个传闻，即他命令其全体阁员写一份效忠十二世伊玛姆的契约，将其投入圣城库姆附近的一口井中，据称该井为伊玛姆的藏身之所。	In recent weeks, Ahmadinejad’s aides have denied another rumor that he ordered his cabinet to write a pact of loyalty with the 12th Imam and throw it down a well near the holy city of Qom, where some believe the Imam is hiding.
但劳尔▪卡斯特罗本人也已年迈。 所以我们可以憧憬着某一个邓小平，或更好的舒瓦雷茨似的人物最终会从古巴革命主义的废墟里出现。	But Raúl Castro is an old man himself, so we can hope for the prospect that some Deng or, better yet, a Suarez will ultimately emerge from the wreckage of Fidelism.
但有了后机械时代的生活标准，我们就可以摒弃几个世纪来某些清教徒式的内疚，从枯燥乏味的工作中抬起头来。	With our post-machine standard of living, we can afford to shed some of the Puritan guilt that has, for centuries, kept our noses to the grindstone.
中国可以与印度和其他国家合作打造新的中东和平构架，或者反过来利用印度及其邻国的危险谋求小的战术优势。	The Chinese can decide to cooperate with India and others to forge a new structure of peace for the greater Middle East or, instead, to use the growing risks that India and its neighbors face to pursue small tactical advantages.
其次，鉴于乌克兰俄罗斯人（Russophone）聚居的东部发生冲突的风险最大，因此应该派遣欧安组织代表团负责保障稳定、安全、确保尊重少数族裔，并且在必要情况下对违反特定承诺的行为加以谴责。	Second, given that the risk of conflict is greatest in Ukraine’s Russophone east, an OSCE mission should be deployed there to ensure stability, security, and respect for minorities, and to condemn, if necessary, violations of specified commitments.
而且，他们胜利者的庆贺残酷地提醒人们，一旦受迫害的人得到解放，他们自己就会非常容易地由受压迫者变成压迫者。	Moreover, their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated, they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves.
事实上，正如首相卡梅伦最近所解释的，英国政府寻求谈判其欧盟成员资格条件，并就结果举行公投，公投结果将决定英国是否继续充当欧盟成员国。	In fact, as Prime Minister David Cameron recently explained, his government seeks to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership, and to hold a referendum on the outcome, which potentially would decide whether the UK remains an EU member.
随便沿着伊斯坦布尔熙熙攘攘的街道散步都会发现戴着头巾和不戴头巾的妇女毫不费力、几乎是自然地相互交融在一起。	Any stroll along a crowded Istanbul street will show covered and uncovered women effortlessly -- almost naturally -- mixing.
儒家与中国另一个主要政治传统法家合二为一，用来为一些做法提供依据，例如对统治者的盲从、压制妇女以及使用重刑。	Confucianism has been combined with Legalism, China’s other main political tradition, to justify such practices as blind obedience to the ruler, subordination of women, and the use of harsh punishments.
随着中国从储蓄剩余转向吸收储蓄 — — 利用其剩余储蓄为中国人构建安全网，而不是补贴美国人的储蓄 — — 储蓄不足的美国将发现难以填补空白。	As China shifts from surplus saving to saving absorption – using its surpluses to build a safety net for the Chinese people rather than subsidize the savings of Americans – a saving-short US will find it tough to fill the void.
到2000年，非洲已经沦为《经济学人 》 （ The Economist）所谓的“没有希望的非洲 ” 。	By 2000, it had been reduced to what The Economist called “Hopeless Africa.”
以卡钦斯基（Jarosław Kaczyński）非正式领导的波兰极右翼政府的第一批动作之一，就是实施了新的媒体法，允许政府聘用和解雇公共广电网络的负责人。	One of the first orders of business for Poland’s far-right government, led unofficially by Jarosław Kaczyński, was to adopt a new media law allowing it to hire and fire the heads of public broadcasting networks.
美国可能最终会发现，向日本发放外交委任状让自己站在了日本利益的对立面，其后果将是日本成为亚洲安全问题而不是解决办法的一部分。	By providing Japan with a diplomatic carte blanche, the US may find itself hostage to Japanese interests, with the result that Japan becomes part of Asia’s security problem, not part of its solution.
无论在线还是离线，随着我们逐渐掌握电子货币的使用，随之而来的经济变革也许比古代先人发明硬币还要意义深远。	The economic revolution - both online and offline - that will be triggered as we learn how to use electronic money may be as profound as that wrought by our ancient ancestors' invention of coins.
但这听起来很像“专家”的说法，而脱欧活动家们也早就做好了应对的准备：经济学家就是唱空英国，好证明他们的负面预测是正确的。	But that sounds like “expert” talk, and the former Leave campaigners have a response to it: economists are talking down the UK to prove that their gloomy forecasts were correct.
他们需要在下一次该组织对如阿根廷、巴西、印度尼西亚和土耳其等某一新兴市场国家实施援助时对政策有更大的影响力。	They want more policy influence the next time the Fund decides to bail out a fellow emerging-market country like Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey.
商业投资显著低于2008年前的预期，去年美国商业投资因为石油价格暴跌所导致的能源部门投资骤降而再遭重创。	Business investment remains significantly below pre-2008 expectations, and has been hit hard again in the US during the last year by the collapse of energy-sector investment in response to the steep drop in oil prices.
如果他们与罗滕伯格、尤里·科瓦尔楚克 （ , Yury Kovalchuk，以普京的个人银行家出名）和普京的事实副手伊戈·谢钦（Igor Sechin ） 、 更不用说俄罗斯极其富裕的公职官员不做区分的话，这合适吗？	Should they not be treated differently from the likes of Rotenberg, Yury Kovalchuk (known as Putin’s personal banker), or Putin’s de facto deputy Igor Sechin, not to mention Russia’s super-wealthy public officials?
此外，日本银行、美联储和欧洲央行的无限制量化宽松也增加了资本流波动性升高和亚洲新兴市场资产泡沫的风险。	Moreover, unlimited quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve, and the European Central Bank also increases the risk of volatile capital flows and asset bubbles in Asian emerging economies.
京都议定书和欧洲贸易计划的调节机制促进了日益兴起的碳贸易的确立，使得有兴趣的政党现在开始对不久的将来表示担忧。	While the regulatory mechanisms of both Kyoto and the European Trading Scheme have contributed to the establishment of an emerging market for carbon trading, interested parties are now concerned about the immediate future.
2001年，英国足总（英国足球监管机构）启动了为期五年的儿童安全措施评估，但只开展了两年便不了了之，据说是因为一些足总工作人员的抵制。	The five-year review of child safety measures, launched by the Football Association (the governing body of UK soccer) in 2001, was dropped after just two years, reportedly in response to resistance from some FA staff.
或许正因如此，法国新总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德（François Hollande）更偏爱用政府手段来引出特定的成果 — — 比如雇佣6万名新教师。	Perhaps for this reason, France’s new president, François Hollande, favors using the government to direct specific outcomes – for example, by hiring 60,000 new teachers.
有人指责这一观点实际上是过时了的自由帝国主义针对冷战后的世界衍生出的新版，布莱尔对此的一贯回应是：他在科索沃，塞拉利昂和伊拉克倡导的是“价值观而非利益”之战。	To the charge that this idea is actually old-fashioned liberal imperialism updated for the post-Cold War world, Blair has consistently replied that what he called for in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, and Iraq are wars of “values, not interests.”
他们指控 IPCC 主席、诺贝尔和平奖得主帕乔里（ R. K. Pachauri ）的科学研究掺杂着金钱动机，试图搞臭这位应对全球变暖运动的标志性人物，与此同时也不忘弹冠相庆一番。	There is also the unholy glee with which they have set about destroying an icon of the anti-global warming movement, the Nobel Laureate R.K Pachauri, by attributing financial motives to his research.
因为被内塔尼亚胡推入到一场反对奥巴马政府与伊朗达成核协议的不可能打赢的战争，美以公共事务委员会现在在狂妄自大的重压下摇摇欲坠。	Having been pushed by Netanyahu into an unwinnable fight against US President Barack Obama’s administration over its nuclear deal with Iran, AIPAC is now crumbling under the weight of its own hubris.
毕竟朝鲜的突然崩溃或者半岛内部的军事冲突将破坏区域安全，而周边国家也会遭到大量难民涌入，以及数以百亿计的重建成本。	After all, North Korea’s sudden collapse or a military conflict on the peninsula would undermine regional security, while burdening neighboring countries with millions of refugees and hundreds of billions of dollars in reconstruction costs.
更令人意想不到的是导弹发射成功，朝鲜第十个加盟全球“太空俱乐部 ” （ 2008年伊朗成功发射萨菲尔火箭后第九个加盟 ） 。	More surprising was the success of the launch, which makes North Korea the tenth member of the world’s “Space Club” (the ninth member was Iran, which successfully launched its Safir rocket in 2008).
从根本上说，强化法治和建立平等竞技场要求建立稳定、有效的产权基础设施，这一制度体系应能激励政府官员尽量提高服务效率。	Strengthening the rule of law and creating a level playing field essentially involve building a stable, effective PRI, composed of institutions that can motivate public officials to deliver services as effectively as possible.
自2014年出任总理以来，他充满热忱地领导了一场扩大数字治理的运动，他还不遗余力地赞美数字治理的效率，宣扬其能改变国家。	Since becoming prime minister in 2014, he has led an enthusiastic campaign to expand digital governance, hailing its efficiency and extolling its capacity to transform the country.
不幸的是，就当前情况来看，这是一场布莱尔不会赢得的全民投票，因为所有的选票都显示绝大多数人坚决反对欧洲宪法。	Unfortunately, as things stand, this is a referendum that Blair will not win, because all polls show a large and solid majority against the European Constitution.
但是，在强调稳定、全球增长条件不利和连续遭遇两次旱灾（在过去，一次旱灾就足以让经济陷入困境）的情况下，印度经济增长仍高于7 % 。	Yet, despite the focus on stability, inhospitable global growth conditions, and two successive droughts (any of which would have thrown the economy into a tailspin in the past), growth is above 7%.
这样做的结果就是鼓励撒谎者用虚假信息和线索阻碍体制，与此同时又不让诚实的人们报告他们的所见所闻，唯恐由于感觉错误而把无辜的邻居关押起来。	The result has been to encourage liars to clog the system with disinformation and false leads while discouraging honest people from reporting what they observe, lest an innocent neighbor be incarcerated on the basis of misperceptions.
在收到了成千上万的反馈之后，他发现尽管人们的国籍、种族、宗教信仰、年龄和性别不同，但反应却出奇的一致。	After receiving tens of thousands of responses, he finds remarkable consistency despite differences in nationality, ethnicity, religion, age, and sex.
从20 世纪30年代开始到20世纪70年代为止是一个长长的自由主义周期，接着就是一个放松经济监管的保守主义周期，该周期现在似乎已经走完了其历程。	A long liberal cycle stretched from the 1930’s to the 1970’s, followed by a conservative cycle of economic deregulation, which now seems to have run its course.
美国身上背负着诸多盟友义务 — — 对日本、韩国、澳大利亚、菲律宾还有泰国 — — 部分是出于防止朝鲜入侵的需要。	The US has multiple alliance obligations – with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand – which are needed, in part, to deter North Korean aggression.
粮食同样也有背后的故事，其中最令人作呕的莫过于农业从业者 — — 那些使晚餐成为可能的人 — — 也最有可能饿着肚子上床睡觉。	Food has backstories, too, none more unsavory than this one: agricultural workers – the people who make dinner possible – are also the most likely to go to bed hungry.
在多大程度上我们能够真正忠于自己的信仰：那就是涉及治病救人，医疗资源要按照病人的需要、而不是他们的财富来进行分配？	To what extent do we hold on to our belief that when it comes to saving lives, medical care should be distributed on the basis of patients’ needs, not their wealth?
伟大的智者像阿伯拉德、伊拉兹马斯、伽利略、伏尔泰、左拉以及拉塞尔都对他们各人所处时代的虔行提出挑战。	Great intellectuals like Abelard, Erasmus, Galileo, Voltaire, Zola, and Russell each challenged the pieties of his era, and we now regard their success as a good thing.
在国家经济体和跨国企业之间彼此激烈争夺市场份额的国际环境下，制定全球统一的市场行为标准越来越有必要。	As national economies and multinational companies compete for market share, global standards of market behavior become increasingly important.
虽然这种方法一直备受争议，因为它意味着将经济的实质控制权交给非由选举产生的技术官僚，但过去的通货膨胀事件已经令中央银行的独立地位得到了广泛认同。	While this approach has always been controversial, given that it implies handing substantial control over the economy to unelected technocrats, past inflationary episodes have fostered broad acceptance of central-bank independence.
在美国，当油价上涨时，德克萨斯州和蒙大拿州的收入会上升，这意味着该两州将向联邦预算贡献更多的税收收入，从而帮助美国的其余地区走出困境。	In the US, when oil prices go up, incomes in Texas and Montana rise, which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget, thereby helping out the rest of the country.
非洲的一切都是极端的：沙漠化、人口的大规模运动，是的，还有种族灭绝暴力，但新式经济增长甚至新治理模式的希望也是如此。	Everything is there in extreme form: desertification, mass movements of populations, and, yes, genocidal violence – but also the hope for new forms of economic growth, if not new modes of governance.
当今世界，核扩散以使全球性常规战争不再具有现实可能性，经济制裁和经济破坏也许将在二十一世纪地缘政治中扮演重要角色。	In a world where nuclear proliferation has rendered global conventional war unthinkable, economic sanctions and sabotage are likely to play a large role in twenty-first-century geopolitics.
回购协议即卖方卖出一种证券（通常是美国国债 ） ， 并承诺在不久后以略高的价格买回（通常在卖出交易后一天 ） 。	A repo, or repurchase agreement, is a sale of a security (often a US Treasury obligation) that the seller promises to buy back later – often the day following the original sale – at a slightly higher price.
虽然它的人口不到一百万，但却拥有着令人自豪的、英勇的历史和数个世纪以来在多种族和殖民主义影响下的丰富文化积淀。	It may have a population of less than one million, but it has a proud, heroic history and a rich culture built up over centuries of diverse ethnic and colonial influences.
但也要尊崇欧洲央行首任行长维恩·迪森博格应对政治家的座右铭 ： “ 我听到他们说什么，但我不会放在心上 。 ”	But he should follow the maxim about politicians set down by the ECB’s first president, Wim Duisenberg: “I can hear them, but I do not listen.”
发自布鲁塞尔 — — 在唐纳德·特朗普总统的领导下，美国继6月1日退出巴黎气候协议之后又在成为流氓国家的道路上迈出一步。	BRUSSELS – Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, the United States took another major step toward establishing itself as a rogue state on June 1, when it withdrew from the Paris climate agreement.
但实证研究表明这一观点存在一个根本性的自相矛盾之处：自邓小平改革开始以来，中国TFP平均年增长率达到了近4 % 。	But empirical research reveals a fundamental problem with this argument: China’s TFP has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 4% since Deng’s reforms began.
类似地，净出口赤字 — — 一国贸易失衡程度最广泛的指标 — — 自2000年以来为GDP的4 % ， 而二十世纪最后三十年间的平均水平为1.1 % 。	Similarly, the net export deficit – the broadest measure of a country’s trade imbalance – has been 4% of GDP since 2000, versus an average of 1.1% over the final three decades of the twentieth century.
去年，G-20成员国同意实施旨在促进基础设施项目和（关键性地）中小企业投资、增加资金支持的全球基础设施计划。	Last year, G-20 members agreed to pursue a global infrastructure initiative aimed at facilitating investment and boosting financing for infrastructure projects and, crucially, for small and medium-size enterprises.

以色列可以决定其军事入侵的方式并且随意终止，而印度的军事行动将会立即触发一场与装备精良的邻国的战争，哪一方都无法取胜。	Israel can dictate the terms of its military incursion and end it at will, whereas an Indian military action would immediately spark a war with a well-armed neighbor that neither side could win.
这一过程已经开始了，并从本世纪初就开始得到政府“走出去”政策的支持（通过鼓励中国企业进行对外直接投资 ） 。	This process has already begun, and has been supported since the beginning of the last decade by the government’s “Going Global” policy, through which it encourages outward FDI from China.
到今天，形势已经渐趋明朗，美国的政策没有在任何方面取得成功，即便的确在伊拉克成功地实现了自由选举，也没有因此带来伊拉克的团结，相反却使这个国家进一步四分五裂。	Today it is clear that hardly any aspect of this policy has succeeded. Even the success of free elections in Iraq is threatening to divide rather than unite the country.
在中国，可再生能源占能源产量的比例从1971年的40%降至今天的11 % ； 到2035年，可能只有9 % 。	In China, renewables’ share in energy production dropped from 40% in 1971 to 11% today; in 2035, it will likely be just 9%.
特朗普在竞选时威胁要撕毁北美自由贸易协定，除非美国能获得更好的条件。 这带来了新的谈判，由美国特别贸易代表主导。	Trump’s campaign threat to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement unless better terms could be agreed has led to renewed negotiations, led by the US Special Trade Representative.
其实，不仅全球绝大多数政府和科学家无法接受对人类生殖细胞进行改造；包括英国在内的40多个国家都明令禁止这种作法。	Indeed, not only do most scientists and governments worldwide consider human germline genetic modification unacceptable; it is expressly prohibited in more than 40 countries, including the UK.
就个人而言，我认为更大的风险在于技术进步的速度增加得太快，使社会难以适应，尽管到目前为止的经验从根本上说都是积极的。	Personally, I think the greater risk is that the pace of technological progress will accelerate too much for societies to adapt, though the experience so far has basically been positive.
接着，2010年，橙色革命的失败让亚努科维奇通过自由公平的选举上了台，而在2012年，普京第三度出任俄罗斯总理。	Then, in 2010, the Orange Revolution’s failure brought Yanukovych to power in a free and fair election, and in 2012 Putin selected himself for a third presidential term in Russia.
巴黎 — — 正值北约在斯特拉斯堡庆祝其成立60周年之际，又迎来了新的两个成员国：阿尔巴尼亚和克罗地亚。	PARIS – During NATO’s recent 60th anniversary ceremony in Strasbourg, the Alliance welcomed two new members, Albania and Croatia, bringing its total membership to 28.
经济和气候全球委员会（Global Commission on the Economy and Climate）发布的最新报告强调，这一方针应该以可持续基础设施投资为中心。	As a recent report released by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate emphasizes, that approach should center on investment in sustainable infrastructure.
在数年内她的肌肉将逐渐失去功能，以致其无法走路，使用双手，咀嚼，吞咽，说话，最终连呼吸都无法进行，然后就只有死亡。	Over a period of a few years, her muscles will weaken until she can no longer walk, use her hands, chew, swallow, speak, and ultimately, breathe. Then she will die.
中国的表现还不错，这很大程度是因为它的政府受到缅甸的事例、围绕西藏抗议所产生的恶劣的公众影响以及即将到来的奥运会所带来的巨大压力，因而允许信息比往常更自由地流通。	China has not fared too badly, largely because its government was forced by the Burmese example, bad publicity surrounding the Tibetan demonstrations, and the impending Olympic Games to allow far more freedom of information than it normally does.
这些企业比传统制造业更能体现合作性和共享性，帮助了消费者和小型初创企业来参与决定产品和服务的内容，包括影响从设计到分销的各个供应链环节。	These businesses are more collaborative or sharing than the traditional business of manufacturing, allowing consumers and smaller start-ups to shape products and services, from design to distribution.
20世纪80年代，日本的年均GDP 增长为4.5 % ， 从20世纪90年代开始，经济几乎陷入停滞，年均增长率只有区区1 % 。	In the 1980’s, Japan’s annual GDP growth averaged 4.5％; since the early 1990’s, the economy has been virtually stagnant, averaging barely 1% annual growth.
事实上，重组和紧随其后的10年改革表明：如果俄国要一以贯之的推进改革，单靠模仿西方民主模式的成型结构是远远不够的。	Indeed, perestroika and the decade of reform that followed demonstrated that just following the formal structures of the Western democratic model isn’t enough if Russia is to see reform implemented consistently.
如今，土耳其面临着多重挑战：日益加剧的极权主义、萎靡不振的经济增长，以及每况愈下的库尔德地区和平进程。	Today, Turkey faces myriad challenges: growing authoritarianism, unimpressive growth, and a faltering Kurdish peace process.
股票分析师可能会为这一决定感到欢欣鼓舞，但宏观经济学的学究们会焦虑于这样的交易会不会大量出现，因为阿根廷的净债务情况将恶化。	Equity analysts may cheer the move, but macro wonks will fret if they see many deals like this one, because Argentina’s net debt position would deteriorate.
保罗·赖恩（Paul Ryan ） — —众议院预算委员会主席，提出在未来十年主要通过砍掉这个计划来实现预算平衡。	Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, proposes to balance the budget over the next 10 years largely by slashing the program.

虽然张伯伦所犯下的错误更加严重，但至少他的政策还可以在自己的国家被摧毁前被扭转过来（正如温斯顿·丘吉尔所为 ） 。	But while the stakes were certainly higher in Chamberlain’s case, at least his polices could be reversed before they destroyed the country (and Winston Churchill did just that).
然而欧洲直到2016年才引入了金融交易税，而所谓的耐心融资（patient finance）依然不合时宜地遍布于各处。	Yet, in Europe, a financial-transaction tax was introduced only in 2016, and so-called patient finance remains inadequate almost everywhere.
中国的增长将继续让世界震惊，事实上，新的国民生产总值（GDP）数据显示中国经济比以前人们认为的要强大 20 % 。	China’s growth continues to astound the world; indeed, new GDP data suggest that its economy is 20% larger than previously thought.
国际移民组织担心，随着更多的人逃离热浪，人类向更小的区域集中可能会对本地“应对能力”造成前所未有的冲击。	The International Organization for Migration fears that as more people flee the heat, the concentration of humanity into smaller spaces will have an unprecedented impact on local “coping capacity.”
政策制定者们如今正在引导阿尔巴尼亚侨民去发挥重要作用 — — 因为他们是人才、投资，市场机会和商业创意的重要来源。	And policymakers are now engaging Albania’s diaspora – found to be an important source of talent, investment, market opportunities, and business ideas – to great effect.
在肯尼亚，法尼丝·尼亚蒂格（Fanice Nyatigo）正在开发一个叫做母亲贴士（MammaTips）的应用，向新妈妈们及时提供关于怀孕、母乳、接种和其他重要健康问题的信息。	In Kenya, Fanice Nyatigo is developing MammaTips, an app that will provide timely information on pregnancy, breastfeeding, immunization, and other important health matters to new mothers.
沙特一直向与阿萨德军队作战的逊尼派叙利亚叛军提供资金和武器，而什叶派伊朗和黎巴嫩什叶派民兵真主党则一直大力支持阿萨德的军队。	The Kingdom has been the primary source of financing and weaponry for Sunni Syrian rebel forces fighting Assad’s army, which is backed heavily by Shia Iran and Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based Shia militia.
在以往的危机里，例如十年前���东亚金融危机，经济复苏的过程很快，因为受到影响的国家可以通过出口重新实现繁荣。	In earlier crises, as in East Asia a decade ago, recovery was quick, because the affected countries could export their way to renewed prosperity.
在遭到质问时，央行行长Volodymyr Stelmakh据称告诉季莫申科他的政策在破坏经济的基础前会先毁掉她的政府。	When confronted about this, Volodymyr Stelmakh, the bank’s governor, is said to have told Tymoshenko that his policies would destroy her government before they broke the back of the economy.
和20世纪60年代非洲众多解放运动一样，非国大党和EPRDF不再响应不断变化的政治和经济要求，与此同时，掠夺性政客及其党羽集结在党的大旗背后。	The ANC and EPRDF, like many of Africa’s liberation movements in the 1960s, stopped responding to evolving political and economic demands, while predatory politicians and their cronies hid behind the party’s banner.
“一个人，他通过不遗余力地取消他的美国同胞的按揭赎回权赚取财富，在我看来，他不具备成为我们的财政部长的正确价值观。	“[A]n individual who made his fortune aggressively foreclosing on his fellow Americans does not possess the right values, in my view, to be our Treasury Secretary.
特朗普将今天美国的惨淡归咎于全球化（尤其是移民）以及为赢得普通美国劳动者斗争竭力推进全球化的“体制”领袖。	Trump paints a bleak picture of life in the US today, blaming globalization (specifically, immigration) and the “establishment” leaders who have advanced it for the struggles of ordinary American workers.
所有这些都引出了特朗普的子女利用其父的总统地位为家族企业谋利的疑问，很多人都指出特朗普是否正在违反利益冲突或限制裙带关系的原则。	All of this has spurred questions about the Trump children’s capacity to leverage their father’s presidency to benefit the family business, with many fixating on whether Trump is violating conflict-of-interest or anti-nepotism rules.
首先是特朗普政府与中国的贸易战，美国对中国施加进口关税的最初一波行动主要是针对那些围绕中国展开的低成本全球价值链所加工的中间产品。	First and foremost is the Trump administration’s trade war with China. The initial waves of US tariffs on Chinese imports are aimed mainly at intermediate goods that are processed by low-cost China-centric GVCs.
但是，这一数字只相当于法国年GDP的2 % ， 光靠这一计划本身可能无法对提高总体就业率产生很大作用。	But, given that this is barely more than 2% of France’s annual GDP, the stimulus plan on its own may not do too much to lift overall employment.
更广泛地讲，所有对南中国海的浅水生态系统的退化和破坏负有责任的国家必须停止威胁该地区生物多样性和经济生产率的活动。	More broadly, all countries responsible for the degradation and destruction of the South China Sea’s shallow-water ecosystems must halt activities that threaten the region’s biodiversity and economic productivity.
中国经济的减速，加上大宗商品超级周期的结束，将给新兴经济体带来更多阻力，大部分新兴经济体都还没有采取提振潜在增长所需要的结构改革。	China’s economic slowdown, together with the end of the commodity super-cycle, will create additional headwinds for emerging economies, most of which have not implemented the structural reforms needed to boost their potential growth.
如何以色列不仅仅是一个镇压巴勒斯坦人民的可怕的国家，而是所有罪恶之源，那么不论什么形式的暴力，不论对己对彼产生多么破坏性的影响，都可以得到论证。	If Israel was not just a fearful nation oppressing the Palestinian people, but the source of all evil, any form of violence, however destructive of self and others, could be justified.
2005年以来，中国住房价格上涨了近50 % — —是全球正常水平的近五倍（据国际清算银行和IMF全球住房观察数据 ） — —平价性显然是一个合理的关注点。	With Chinese home prices up nearly 50% since 2005 – nearly five times the global norm (according to the Bank for International Settlements and IMF global housing watch) – affordability is obviously a legitimate concern.
但是，事实上该关税制约了汽车业和其他钢铁用户，也引起了报复 — — 一如特朗普的关税今天将会导致的有害影响。	But, while in effect, the tariffs strained the auto industry and other steel users, while inviting retaliation – precisely the same adverse impacts Trump’s tariffs will have today.
为了详细说明这一点，假设一个国家的政府债务总额相对GDP的比率为250 ％ ， 净债务相当于150 ％ ， 央行持有相当于100％的债券，那么净债务为50 ％ 。	To see why, suppose a country had gross government debt of 250% of GDP, net debt of 150%, and central bank bond holdings of 100% of GDP, leaving net debt of 50%.
安倍承诺一旦遏制住通缩且经济恢复增长就要恢复公共财政的可持续性，而日本银行的对应行动也能因此推断出来。	The BOJ’s action is predicated on Abe’s commitment to restoring the sustainability of public finances once deflation has been defeated and the economy has returned to growth.
欧洲进行了可怕的宗教战争，两次世界大战以及不只一次的大屠杀，来解决其在边界和民族主义上的地方性争端。	It took Europe gruesome religious wars, two world wars, and more than one genocide to resolve its endemic disputes over borders and nationalism.
贸易促进的主要风险之一是贸易转移 — — 即两国间征收关税的减少导致消费者拒绝选择来自第三国的更为廉价的产品。	One major risk of trade facilitation is trade diversion – that is, a reduction in customs duties between two countries leads consumers to avoid less expensive products from third countries.
倘若五月初玛琳·勒庞得胜，欧盟就将终结，只留下德国总理默克尔（Angela Merkel）苦苦支撑一个行将崩溃的世界秩序。	A victory for Le Pen in early May would spell the end of the EU, leaving German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the final pillar of a crumbling world order.
借助综合性的手段，11个新兴经济体（阿根廷、巴西、中国、印度、印尼、墨西哥、尼日利亚、俄罗斯、沙特，南非和土耳其）可以在2025年平均将各自的年均生产力增长率推高到6 % 。	With a comprehensive approach, 11 emerging economies (Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey) could, on average, boost their annual productivity growth to as much as 6% by 2025.
这些收益 — — 其中三分之一强可以在美国一个国家实现 — — 足以满足当前世界基础设施需求的一半。	These gains, more than a third of which can be realized in the US alone, would be enough to meet half the world’s current infrastructure needs.
尽管较为温和的希拉里·克林顿有望击败鲁莽的孤立主义者唐纳德·特朗普，但支持特朗普崛起的对开放的抵制不会凭空消散。	While the more moderate Hillary Clinton is likely to defeat the recklessly isolationist Donald Trump, the backlash against openness that has fueled Trump’s rise will not dissipate on its own.
在游牧社会，拥有无法搬运的东西毫无必要，但是一旦人们定居下来并且发展起了金钱机制，这种物质占用的限制消失了。	For nomadic societies, there was no point in owning anything that one could not carry, but once humans settled down and developed a system of money, that limit to acquisition disappeared.
在意大利，民粹主义候选人毕比·格里洛（Beppe Grillo）领先民调，预计能够拉到三分之一的群众选票。	There, populist candidate Beppe Grillo is leading polls and is expected to pull in about a third of the popular vote.
同时许多新兴经济体的政府都不愿意维持大量和持续的经常账户赤字（这可以理解 ） ， 将导致他们通过增加出口量来应对疲软的出口价格，即便这将进一步压低价格。	And many emerging-economy governments’ understandable aversion to running substantial and persistent current-account deficits will lead them to counter weaker export prices by increasing export volume, even if that drives down prices further.
面对英国的傻瓜社会主义（某些人认为这是对地球上苦难巴勒斯坦人无害的支持表现 ） ， 汗在表达强烈谴责时从来就没有犹豫过。	In the face of this British socialism of fools, which some portray as inoffensive support for the wretched of the earth in Palestine, Khan has had no trouble voicing strong condemnation.
这可能导致信心崩溃，引发金融动荡，反过来，迫使这个国家寻求第三种救助方案 — — 让希腊离开欧元区，引入一个新的贬值货币。	This could lead to a collapse in confidence, triggering financial upheaval and, in turn, forcing the country to seek a third bailout – one that would require Greece to leave the eurozone and introduce a new, devalued currency.
过去两年来，华盛顿沉溺于削减赤字、将债务/GDP比率保持在“可持续”路径上，尽管全球投资者纷纷涌向美国国债，把利率推向了历史低点。	During the last two years, Washington has been obsessed with the need to cut the deficit and put the debt/GDP ratio on a “sustainable” path, even as global investors have flocked to US government debt, driving interest rates to historic lows.
当政治建立在这些基础上时，赢得选举的将是最能“激发”我们的潜在文化和心理标签的政客，而不是最能代表我们的利益的政客。	When politics is waged on these grounds, elections are won by those who are most successful at “priming” our latent cultural and psychological markers, not those who best represent our interests.
但是，泛美开发银行（IADB）的一份2013年报告明确指出，财政刺激并不总能在危机过去后及时推出，因此现在拉美地区的财政状况比2007年更加疲软。	But, as a 2013 Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) report makes clear, the fiscal stimulus was not always withdrawn in time when the crisis abated, so the fiscal position across the region today is weaker than it was in 2007.
争端解决机制向来是世贸组织的骄傲：它旨在判决并执行世贸组织规定的各项合同义务，是世贸组织制定并被成员国所认可的唯一有约束力的公正机制。	The DSM is the pride of the WTO: it is the only impartial and binding mechanism for adjudicating and enforcing contractual obligations defined by the WTO and accepted by its members.
根据非洲绿色革命联盟的经验，仅仅将一个每天收入不足1美元的小生产者收入提高一倍，这只能算是救济，因为即便日收入达到了2美元，他/她依然生活在贫困线之下。	In IFAD’s experience, working simply to double the income of a smallholder farmer who scrapes by on less than a dollar a day is poverty management, because at two dollars a day, he or she still remains poor.
一再试图按照民族主义情绪重写历史 — — 有时是通过教科书修订进行书面改写 — — 导致成立地区机构成为几乎不可能的任务。	Repeated attempts to rewrite history – sometimes literally, through textbook revisions – along nationalist lines make it nearly impossible to establish regional institutions.
欧元区若要继续存在，则需要提出一项可靠的方案，解决其长期存在的主权债务危机问题，而这反过来又需要解决外部失衡和财政失衡两大问题，这两种宏观经济失衡问题正是这一危机的核心。	The eurozone’s survival demands a credible solution to its long-running sovereign-debt crisis, which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances – external and fiscal – which are at the heart of that crisis.
比如，奥巴马政府与美国制造商协会（National Association of Manufacturers）的一个附属机构合作成立了一个制造业技能认证系统，其标准由行业集团制定。	The Obama administration, for example, cooperated with an arm of the National Association of Manufacturers to launch a manufacturing skills certification system based on standards established by industry groups.
中国社科院经济学家蔡昉认为，只有从中国独特的历史、人口和地理角度出发，兼顾技术和全球发展趋势，才能理解这个过程。	According to China Academy of Social Sciences economist Cai Fang, it can be understood only in the context of the country’s unique history, demography, and geography, not to mention broader technological and global trends.
"如今世界各国的领袖们在忙于处理经济危机的同时，还在为全球气候问题不断地努力工作，如今，他们已经找到了一条“解决之道 "" 。"	But leaders, struggling to cope with this challenge even amidst economic crisis, need to know that there is also “a way.”
2013年，希腊名列出口复杂性阿特拉斯指数的第48位 — — 是目前欧洲发达国家的最低排名 — — 而阿根廷名列第67位。	By 2013, Greece ranked 48th in the Atlas’s index of complexity of exports – by far the lowest of any developed country in Europe – while Argentina ranked 67th.
类似地，数百万非洲人在非正式经济中讨生活。 在非洲的大部分国家里，非正式经济贡献了大约 41%的 GDP。	Similarly, millions of Africans are scratching out a living in the informal economy, which represents about 41% of GDP in most parts of the continent.
所有其他的费用都是“自行承担 ” ： 一个国家为军事行动派出的军队和提供的装备越多，它最后的支出就越多。	All other expenses “lie where they fall”: the more troops and equipment a country contributes to a mission, the more it ends up paying.
而欧盟将如何分辨政府为创造有利投资环境以及增加外国直接投资而造成的“良性”经常性项目赤字和“不良”经常性项目赤字呢？	So, how will the European Union distinguish between “good” current-account deficits – a government creates a favorable business climate, generating inflows of foreign direct investment – and “bad” current-account deficits?
虽然希腊经济崩盘，但新政府仍固执地要求不以紧缩为条件的债务纾困 — — 直到7月中旬突然同意债权人的条件。	Even as their country’s economy crashed, Greece’s new government remained adamant in demanding debt relief without austerity – that is, until mid-July, when they suddenly agreed to the creditors’ terms.
所有妇女及其伴侣选择适合自己的计划生育方法的权利必须得到尊重，而且所有人都必须随时能够得到品种齐全的高质量避孕药具。	The rights of all women and their partners to choose the family-planning method that is appropriate for them must be respected, and a full range of quality contraceptives must be readily available to all.
事实上，正如20世纪30年代大量支持极左政党的选民态度做出一百八十度大转弯、最终转而支持右翼极权主义政党，今天的民粹主义政党的经济思想看上去也在从多个角度殊途同归。	Indeed, just as many supporters of radical leftist parties in the 1930s made a U-turn and ended up supporting authoritarian parties of the right, the economic ideologies of today’s populist parties seem to converge in many ways.
低利率使美元更具竞争力，但因为房地产的现状和信贷市场的功能失灵，除此之外的货币政策似乎失去了牵引力。	The low interest rate helped by making the dollar more competitive, but otherwise monetary policy appears to have lost traction because of the condition of the housing sector and the dysfunctional state of the credit markets.
实际上，英国南极调查局最近的评估显示，自从20世纪70年代以来，南极上空的温度已经升高了3.6度，变暖速度比迄今为止研究人员所认为的要快得多。	Indeed, recent assessments by the British Antarctic Survey suggest that temperatures over the Antarctic have increased 3.6 degrees since the early 1970’s, and that warming is taking place far faster than researchers had hitherto believed.
但白宫顾问彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro）还想加强原产地规则的要求，他的办法是提高享受零关税待遇的产品的本地内容比重。	Yet White House adviser Peter Navarro wants to make the rules of origin even more demanding, by raising the share of local content required for a product to qualify for zero tariffs.
毕竟，虽然满足10年学校教育的国家2010年一般人均收入为30,000美元，但达到同样教育水平的阿尔巴尼亚、亚美尼亚和斯里兰卡的人均收入还不到5，000美元。	After all, though the typical country with ten years of schooling had a per capita income of $30,000 in 2010, per capita income in Albania, Armenia, and Sri Lanka, which have achieved that level of schooling, was less than $5,000.
如果“占领华尔街”运动告诉了我们什么，那就是，美国经济最需要解决的问题就是被债务压得喘不过气的家庭。	If the Occupy Wall Street movement tells us anything, it is that the last thing the US economy needs is more households overwhelmed by debt.
即使在收入分配确实开始改善的最好情况下，所有派别的经济学家全都赞同的一个观点是可能会极为缓慢的发生变化。	Even in the best-case scenario, in which income distribution did begin to improve, one thing economists of all stripes agree on is that change would be glacially slow.
自从2003年美国领导入侵伊拉克以来，伊拉克的政治制度已经沿宗派界限高度两极化，导致执政的什叶派多数族裔边缘化逊尼派人口，其中也包括库尔德人。	Since the US-led invasion in 2003, Iraq’s political system has become highly polarized along sectarian lines, with the ruling Shia majority marginalizing the Sunnis, including the Kurds.
但政府可以通过多种方式与非营利组织、投资者、企业和公民合作寻找实现这些目标的最佳办法 — — 从而重塑公众对政府的信任本身。	But there are numerous ways in which governments can work with non-profits, investors, businesses, and citizens to find the best ways to achieve these goals – and thus restore public trust in government itself.
2000年，联合国通过了一项由所谓千年发展目标支持的发展计划，原则是没有人应该承受极端贫困所带来的后果。	In 2000, the UN adopted a development agenda underpinned by the so-called Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and guided by the principle that no one should have to suffer the consequences of extreme poverty.
以澳大利亚板球队队长迈克尔·克拉克（Michael Clarke）为例。 在最近的一场比赛中，他对一位对方选手构成了人身威胁。	Consider the case of Michael Clarke, the captain of the Australian cricket team, who recently threatened bodily harm to an opposing player.
作为对特朗普政府立场的回应，德国、法国和英国联合俄罗斯和中国，宣布计划准备绕开美元、美国银行和美国政府的审查。	In response to the Trump administration’s stance, Germany, France, and Britain, together with Russia and China, have announced plans to circumvent the dollar, US banks, and US government scrutiny.
还有人想纳入更多“特殊情况 ” ， 使国内生产总值长期发展欠佳的所有年份都可以打破赤字上限，而不受-2%增长率的限制。	Others seek to broaden the definition of “exceptional circumstances” to permit the deficit ceiling to be breached in any year with prolonged unsatisfactory GDP growth, not just -2%.
在这方面，来自意大利总理伦齐的支持 — — 他的政党在意大利获得了41%的选票，这意味着他很有可能是硕果仅存的货真价实的国家层面赢家 — — 是大有裨益的。	To this end, support from Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi – whose party won 41% of his country’s vote, arguably making him the only real winner at the national level – could help.
比如，卡梅伦要求删掉一条“红线 ” ， 以免计划中的《存款担保机制条例 》 （ Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive）受到“合格多数否决 ” （ Qualified Majority Voting）程序（意味着没有哪个成员国拥有否决权）的约束。	For example, Cameron wanted to strike a “red line” through the proposal to subject the planned Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive to the Qualified Majority Voting procedure (meaning that no member state would have veto power).
美联储不保留投票记录，但其主要决策的“持异见者”会被披露（在艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）任美联储主席期间几乎没有持异见者，而在最近持异见者变得普遍起来 ） 。	The Fed does not keep a voting record, but “dissents” from its major decisions are noted (these were almost unheard of when Alan Greenspan was Chairman, but have since become more common).
许多欧元支持者认为，唯一的解决方案是建立完整的政治联盟，这将允许欧元区内从竞争力强势国家向弱势国家实施转移支付。	The only solution, many euro supporters now contend, is full political union, which would allow for fiscal transfers from the eurozone’s more competitive countries to their weaker counterparts.
突尼斯的情况也好不到哪里去，据自由之家（Freedom House）2015年的报告 ， “ 诽谤罪仍是独立报道的最大障碍之一 。 ”	The situation is not much better in Tunisia, where, according to Freedom House’s 2015 report, “criminal defamation remains one of the biggest obstacles to independent reporting.”
在经济萧条时削减赤字绝非复苏之路，反之，恰恰是收缩之路，因为这意味着连同政府收入所依赖的国民收入一起削减了。	Deficit reduction in a depressed economy is the road not to recovery, but to contraction, because it means cutting the national income on which the government’s revenues depend.
当然，柏拉图在这篇对话中的目的不是定义虔诚：如果苏格拉底了解比游叙佛伦所提供的不可接受的虔诚定义更好的定义，他不会不说出来。	Of course, Plato’s purpose in the dialogue is not to define piety: if Socrates knows of a better definition than the unacceptable ones offered by Euthyphro, he does not reveal it.
关于薄熙来及其在今年 — — 领导层过渡的关键之年 — — 免职对中国国内政治的影响的内容只字未提。	There was no mention of Bo Xilai and what his dismissal meant for China’s domestic politics in this critical year of leadership transition.
那种憎恨依然存在，部分是因为历史上日本人所带给他们的痛苦，但是现在日本人因为认识到由他们在这一地区所开创的经济奇迹已经远远超出了本国的范围而重新把自己看成是亚洲人了。	That resentment remains, sustained in part by historical grievances, but the Japanese have now come to perceive themselves as Asians, helped by their realization that the economic miracle that they initiated in the region has gone well beyond them.
托马斯·哈丁（Thomas Harding）对鲁道夫·霍斯（Rudolf Höss）的描述也体现了类似的正常性。 霍斯是奥斯维辛集中营负责人，他为以出色完成任务而自豪。	A similar normality emerges from Thomas Harding’s portrait of Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, a man proud of having excelled at his assigned task.
在去年的联合国大会上，世界领导人通过了2030年可持续发展议程和可持续发展目标 (SDG ) ， 其中就包括“不让一个人落下”的承诺。	Last year at the United Nations General Assembly, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which include a commitment to “leave no one behind.”
此次入侵甚至与被抓的前重庆市委书记薄熙来联系在一起，薄熙来曾经试图与解放军和武警高级军官建立紧密联系。	The incursion has even been linked to the scandal surrounding Chongqing’s disgraced former Communist Party chief, Bo Xilai, who had close ties with high-ranking PLA and security-services officers.
史蒂芬·米勒（Stephen Miller）等特朗普的顾问将筑墙描述为由“爱”驱动的政策 — — 对显然是根据空间来定义的美国政治共同体的爱。	Trump advisers like Stephen Miller tellingly describe the construction of the wall as a policy driven by “love” – that is, love of the American political community, clearly defined in space.
缓慢的衰落 — — 如古罗马和十八世纪的西班牙 — — 要比迅速衰落的破坏性小得多，但最终，最佳情形是未来十年俄罗斯以重新平衡的复苏面貌出现。	A gradual decline, like that of ancient Rome or eighteenth-century Spain, is less disruptive than a rapid one, but ultimately the best scenario would feature a recovering and rebalanced Russia over the next decade.
随着气候变化和可持续发展全球行动不断向前推进，市政领导可以在各自的城市从改善居民健康和福祉的有针对性、本地化和可以复制的植树战略开始采取行动。	As global action on climate change and sustainability moves forward, municipal leaders can take their own steps, starting with a targeted, localized, and replicable tree-planting strategy that improves the health and wellbeing of their residents.
据阿卜杜勒·古赖尔教育基金会CEO梅沙·贾勒伯特（Maysa Jalbout）透露，该基金希望在未来十年为15,000名中东学生提供奖学金。	According to Maysa Jalbout, CEO of the Abdulla al-Ghurair Foundation for Education, the fund hopes to provide scholarships for 15,000 Middle Eastern students over the next ten years.
类似地，供给管理研究所（ISM）制造业指数是非常好的美国经济未来3—6个月的前瞻指标，尽管制造业只占其GDP的相对较小比重。	Similarly, the Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Index provides a pretty good preview of the US economy for the next 3-6 months, even though manufacturing comprises a relatively small share of GDP.
墨西哥的最近三任总统 — — 欧内斯托 · 塞迪略 ， 比森特 · 福克斯 和卡尔德隆 — — 所尝试建立的国家警察部队至今也还远远无法取代军队在缉毒行动中的作用。	The National Police Force that Mexico’s last three presidents – Ernesto Zedillo, Vicente Fox and Calderón – have tried to build is still far from ready to replace the Army in drug-enforcement tasks.
对直接外资的保守态度（任何外来事务也都会面临同样的命运）在所有国家集团中普遍存在，而政治家们可以让这样的保守态度浮出水面，造成保护主义的后果。	Reservations against FDI (as against anything foreign) can be found in all groups of countries, and politicians can bring them to the surface, resulting in protectionism.
特拉维夫—即使在最近的停火达成之前，以色列在加沙的两难困境便昭然若揭了 — — 这绝不是简单地把哈马斯挑战诉诸武力解决的问题。	TEL AVIV – Even before the latest cease-fire took hold, it had become clear that the dilemma facing Israel in Gaza entails more than simply developing military answers to the challenge posed by Hamas.
此后不久，约翰逊形容梅的脱欧谈判立场相当于“为英国宪法披上自杀式炸弹背心 ” ， 并将引爆装置交给欧盟。	Soon after, Johnson described May’s EU negotiating position as being tantamount to wrapping “a suicide vest around the British constitution” and handing the detonator to the EU.
新的信贷额度的主要问题是，它有不适当地将发展中国家分成两类的风险，而这对发展中国家来说，会产生重大的额外风险。	The major problem with the new credit line is that it runs the risk of unduly dividing developing countries into two categories, with significant additional risks for the latter.
当然，经济发展水平尚不能与挪威相媲美的国家往往面临着与性别有关的其他挑战，包括获得的饮用水和教育机会不足。	Of course, countries that are not yet at Norway’s level of economic development typically face other gender-related challenges, including limited access to water and education.
通过强调巴勒斯坦人所处的困境，桑德斯不仅凸显了自身以道德为重的世界观 — — 这样的观点当然很有可能演变为理想主义 — — 同时凸显了他理解一种重要的选民情绪。	In emphasizing the Palestinians’ plight, Sanders has highlighted not only his own morality-focused worldview – one that can tip into idealism, to be sure – but also his understanding of the mood of an important constituency.
但许多年以来哈马斯和其他激进派别一直都抵制奥斯陆进程，理由是在以色列占领的情况下举行自由选举简直是荒唐的。	But for years Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups have rejected the Oslo process, on the grounds that free elections under Israeli occupation would be absurd.
英格兰银行过去希望通过加印3750亿英镑新钞（约合6000亿美元）可以刺激共计500亿英镑的支出（或等于3%的GDP ） 。	The Bank of England hoped that by printing £375 billion of new money, ($600 billion), it would stimulate total spending to the tune of £50 billion, or 3% of GDP.
在这一迈斯特谶语的新挑战中，近200名年轻商人克服了来自霍多尔科夫斯基命运的恐惧，为纳瓦尔尼的选战慷慨解囊。	In a new challenge to de Maistre’s maxim, almost 200 young businessmen overcame the fear inspired by Khodorkovsky’s fate and donated funds to Navalny’s campaign.
这些经历与经济思想中所谓边际革命（Marginal Revolution）所孕育的信念相冲突，而古典劳动价值论也被现代主观市场价格价值理论所取代。	These experiences clash with the beliefs forged by the so-called Marginal Revolution in economic thought, when the classical labor theory of value was replaced by the modern, subjective value theory of market prices.
她一回归选战，纽约和新泽西就爆发了爆炸事件，更有两起警察枪击未携带武器的非洲裔美国人事件，导致摇摆州加利福尼亚北部爆发游行示威。	Just as she resumed campaigning, there were bombings in New York and New Jersey, and two more police shootings of unarmed African Americans, which spurred demonstrations in North Carolina, a swing state.
但是，这一不轻不重的用词并没有影响到以色列的立法机构，他们很快就更进一步，宣布以政府征收巴勒斯坦私有土地用于为约旦河西岸的数千名以色列人建造房子为合法。	That mild statement, however, did not trouble the Israeli legislature, which soon took matters a step further, by legalizing the government’s expropriation of privately owned Palestinian land to build thousands of homes for Israelis in the West Bank.
2008年全球金融危机让美国经济陷入了低水平均衡，其特征是就业创造不力、长期和年轻人失业居高不下，以及日益恶化的收入、财富和机会不平等。	The 2008 global financial crisis left the US economy mired in a low-level equilibrium, characterized by sluggish job creation, persistently high long-term and youth unemployment, and growing inequalities of income, wealth, and opportunity.
由其财政部长朔伊布勒（Wolfgang Schäuble）提出的德国方案凸显出三年前上一次援助方案实施以来希腊与其欧洲伙伴国关系所发生的根本性变化。	The German proposal, spearheaded by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, highlights the fundamental change that has occurred in Greece’s relationship with its European partners since its last bailout package three years ago.
在世界上，只有很少的发展中国家有真正自由而公正的选举，而在贫穷且文盲普遍的国发展中国家中，进行自由公正的选举的国家就更少了。	There are few developing countries in the world where this is true, and fewer still where poverty and illiteracy are both rife.
尽管欧洲几十年前就已经明白了这一点，但在最近的经济危机的影响下，即期目标仍成为当务之急，而这往往是以牺牲长期目标为代价的。	Although Europeans have known this for decades, in the wake of the recent economic crisis, immediate goals took priority over – and often at the expense of – long-term objectives.
但是，即使中东能源进口有所减少，美国仍不能放弃中东，因为美国在以色列、核不扩散、人权等问题上都有重大利益。	But, even with reduced energy imports from the Middle East, the US cannot turn its back on the region, given its interests in Israel, non-proliferation, and human rights, among others.
这是两周前举行的波兰议会选举和星期日举行的非决定性总统选举（10月23日多·图斯克和莱赫·卡钦斯基的决选将最终确定选举结果）告诉我们的惨痛教训。	That is the sad lesson of Poland’s parliamentary election two weeks ago, and of Sunday’s indecisive presidential election (which will be decided by a run off between Donald Tusk and Lech Kaczynski on October 23rd.)
但作为减小核武器威胁的全球性措施的基础 — — 1968年核不扩散条约（NPT）的签署国，它们也有义务这样做。	But, as signatories to the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – the foundation of global efforts to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons – they also had an obligation to do so.
基地组织像很久以前的游击运动一样采用所谓的“思想战线”模式：由接受相关意识形态的城市小团体和/或脆弱个体自主招募或者成立附属机构。	And, like guerrilla movements of yore, Al Qaeda partakes of “ideological front” tactics: small urban cells and/or vulnerable individuals subscribe to the ideology and self-recruit or self-start an affiliated cell.
但是，越来越多的缅甸妇女和女孩子们已经开始讲述她们在该国饱受战乱之苦的地区被强奸的经历和其他形式的性暴力。	But an increasing number of women and girls from Burma have begun to tell of their experiences of rape and other forms of sexual violence in the country’s war-torn areas.
1995年5月和8月初相继爆发的克罗地亚攻势从塞族分裂势力的控制下收复了四块中的三块联合国保护领土。	Croatian military offensives, first in early May 1995, and a second in early August, had taken back three of four United Nations-protected sectors from separatist Serb control.
欧洲如今已经在欧洲中央银行任命有一位单一监管人，但它缺乏一个共同的存款保险方案，而德国官员反对该方案的理由是欧洲银行系统的风险还未降到合理水平。	Europe now has a single supervisor in the European Central Bank, but it lacks a common deposit insurance scheme, which German officials oppose on the grounds that there has been inadequate risk reduction in the European banking system.
非洲国家已经确定了它们在医疗、教育、农业以及基础设施(包括道路、电力以及互联网方面)的高度优先投资。	African countries have already identified their high-priority investments in health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure (including roads, power, and internet connectivity).
北京—美联储退出所谓”量化宽松 ” （ 大规模月度长期资产购买）的决定正在引起关于中国经济硬着陆的恐慌。	BEIJING – The US Federal Reserve’s decision to exit from so-called “quantitative easing” – its massive monthly purchases of long-term assets – is stoking fears of a hard economic landing in China.
一个很有说明意义的例子是英语有三十多个表示不同程度恐惧和焦虑的词汇：worry、concern、apprehension、unease、disquietude、inquietude、angst、misgiving、nervousness、tension，等等。	It is telling that the English language has more than three dozen words for gradations of fear and anxiety: worry, concern, apprehension, unease, disquietude, inquietude, angst, misgiving, nervousness, tension, and so forth.
但是，据盖洛普的调查，只有32%的美国人对传统媒体机构有“极大”或“相当大”的信任 — — 这一比例为历史最低。	But, according to Gallup, only 32% of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in traditional media outlets – an all-time low.
自那以后，德国政府就不断利用其政治影响力去挖空原本提出的银行联盟方案；最后剩下的就只是一个徒有其表的躯壳。	Since then, the German government has used its clout to eviscerate the proposed banking union; all that remains is a shell to keep up appearances.
反过来中国经济几乎不会受到新制裁的影响：朝鲜的年度GDP仅为280亿美元，不过相当于其庞大邻国经济总量的一个零头。	Yet China’s economy would barely register the effect of new sanctions: North Korea’s annual GDP, at a meager $28 billion, constitutes little more than a rounding error for its giant neighbor.
用货币政策补偿其他政策领域的低效率构成了制度性故障：货币决策这未必造成了错误，但他们被其他政策设置束缚住了手脚。	Using monetary policy to compensate for deficiencies in other policy areas constitutes an institutional breakdown: monetary policymakers are not necessarily getting it wrong, but they are constrained by the configuration of other policies.
尽管这些指标有着广为诟病的局限性，但凭借着简明性 — — 更不用说科学进步固有的竞争了 — — 它们仍具有相广泛的吸引力。	Despite the well-documented limitations of these measures, their simplicity – not to mention the competition inherent to scientific progress – makes them widely appealing.
根据联合国的统计数字，2006年2月份后出现的难民中有69%来自巴格达，这表明首都“教派化”的程度。	According to the UN, 69% of those displaced since February 2006 come from Baghdad, which demonstrates the extent of the “sectarianization” of the capital.
建立一个囊括世界上所有知识的本体可能是一项艰巨的任务，这需要编撰一部大百科全书这样的精力和专业知识，但它还是可行的。	Building an ontology encapsulating the world’s knowledge may be an immense task, requiring an effort comparable to compiling a large encyclopedia and the expertise to build it, but it is feasible.
在美国，特朗普的总统任期将继续摇摆而低效，越来越多的美国人将意识到，尽管摆出一副十足的民粹主义模样，但特朗普其实只是个保护富人利益的财阀。	In the US, Trump’s presidency would remain volatile and ineffective, with a growing number of Americans realizing that, despite his populist pretense, Trump is merely a plutocrat protecting the interests of the rich.
另一个例子在秘鲁，30余家金融机构选择了类似的非传统方法盈利，它们合作建立了Modelo Perú，一家提供数字金融服务的平台。	Another example is to be found in Peru, where more than 30 financial institutions chose a similarly unconventional path to profitability, working together to establish Modelo Perú – a platform that provides digital financial services.
基本上，希腊公民从地方银行贷款，资金主要来源于希腊央行，而希腊央行又通过欧洲央行的紧急流动性援助（ELA）机制获得资金。	Basically, Greek citizens take out loans from local banks, funded largely by the Greek central bank, which acquires funds through the European Central Bank’s emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) scheme.
2013年年底，就业人数仍比危机前峰值低110万；要恢复峰值水平需要新增770万个岗位，以吸收后续增加的劳动力市场新军。	Employment at the end of 2013 was still 1.1 million short of its pre-recession peak; regaining this peak requires 7.7 million more jobs, in addition to absorbing subsequent monthly entrants to the labor force.
这个哀伤到发狂的巨匠、警醒的自杀牛仔（suicidal cowboy ） ， 将自己牺牲的遗体献给了镜头和着迷的“粉丝”群，此时，他击中了作为反派人物的弗朗索瓦·莫亚力克（François Mauriac ） 。	When this distraught colossus of sorrow, the unsleeping and suicidal cowboy, offered his body in sacrifice to the camera and to the mob of entranced fans, he struck François Mauriac as a Mephistophelean figure.
与此同时，在美国，美国人道协会（Humane Society of the US）的积极奔走已经说服50家主要猪肉采购商宣布将不会购买使用窄圈饲养母猪的供应商的猪肉。	Meanwhile, in America, active campaigning by the Humane Society of the US has led to about 50 major pork buyers announcing that they will phase out their purchase of pork from suppliers who use sow stalls.
过去十年来，欧洲内部银行业关系的发展十分迅速，之所以如此，很大程度上要归功于废除了针对外国服务供应商的正式和非正式壁垒。	The rapid growth in intra-European banking relations in the past decade was made possible to a large extent by the abolition of formal and informal barriers to foreign service providers.
朝鲜半岛公开打仗或核事故将引发人道主义灾难，破坏对韩贸易（韩国是世界第十三大经济体 ） ， 并在全世界造成政治余波。	Open warfare or a nuclear incident on the Korean Peninsula would trigger a humanitarian disaster, interrupt trade with South Korea – the world’s 13th largest economy – and send political shockwaves around the world.
The term “green economy” was coined years ago – even prior to the first Earth Summit in 1992 – to provide a new lens through which to examine the links between economics and sustainability.	The term “green economy” was coined years ago – even prior to the first Earth Summit in 1992 – to provide a new lens through which to examine the links between economics and sustainability.
苏联人非常渴望达成这项协议，以至于他们接受了协议条款，却几乎没有注意到上述条款包含了后二战时期主要的国际人权准则。	The Soviets were so eager for an agreement that they accepted provisions that, barely noticed at the time, incorporated the principal post-WWII international human-rights norms.
伊萨卡—步入2012年之际，我们值得思考一下新兴市场的十年强劲经济增长是如何引发去年波涛汹涌的政治转型的。	ITHACA – With 2012 underway, it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year’s resounding political transformations.
就连俄国人都有可能愿意接受这一框架，因为这样做避免了指责特定人员，并确保将由法院而不是媒体来决定事实真相和责任者。	Even the Russians may be willing to accept this framing, because it avoids finger-pointing against particular actors and affirms that a court of law – not a series of media statements – will determine what occurred and who is responsible.
实际上，我们现在知道日本的经济困境是由巨大的资产泡沫增长和随后破灭以及未能利用货币政策在泡沫破裂后防止通货紧缩而造成的。	Rather, we now know that Japan’s economic difficulties were caused by the growth, and then collapse, of a huge asset bubble, and the failure to use monetary policy to prevent deflation after the bubble burst.
那一年，国会通过了首部“农业法案 ” — —即“农业调整法案 ” — —推动了对农村经济的投资，成功地在两年内将农民收入提高了50 % 。	That year, Congress passed the first “farm bill,” the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which boosted investment in the rural economy and helped lift farm income by 50% within two years.
为了避免消极的整治结果，德国同意削减其在欧盟事务上的投票权重，这一不平衡直到2009年里斯本条约（Lisbon Treaty）生效后才得到纠正。	To avoid negative political consequences, Germany agreed to be underrepresented in weighted voting on EU matters – an imbalance in its own right that was not substantially corrected until the Lisbon Treaty entered into effect in 2009.
如果像现在这样，欧洲不愿继续容许南方花钱比挣钱多而北方挣钱比花钱多，就必须相应地调整工资、价格和生产率。	Now, if, as appears to be the case, Europe does not want its south to spend more than it earns and its north to spend less, wages, prices, and productivity must shift.
不过，对欧盟政客来说，长期是遥远的，中间隔着好几个短期选举挑战，因此支持改革的政府可能撑不到改革效果显现的那一刻。	For EU politicians, however, the long term will be reached only after a series of short-term electoral challenges, so pro-reform governments may well not survive to reap the benefits.
但是现在，这些药品对儿童和青少年的安全性问题及其副作用 — — 其中包括不断上升的自杀率 — — 已经引起了许多国家政府的重视。	Now, however, concerns over these drugs’ safety and side effects in children and adolescents – including elevated suicide rates – have awakened regulators in many countries.
从理论上说，随着经济的复苏和利率的上升，央行所支付的储备金利息也会增加，因此它们可以为所持有的长期证券融资，并逐渐减少持有量。	In theory, as the economy picks up and interest rates begin to climb, central banks will simply pay higher interest rates on their reserves, so that they can finance their holdings of long-term securities and shrink them slowly.
他叫停了几项明智的、有利于增长的税收削减计划，其中几项要到马克龙第一个任期结束（2022年）后才有可能恢复。	He has postponed several clever pro-growth tax cuts, some until the end of Macron’s current term of office in 2022. A couple of days later, Macron changed tack and brought some of these cuts a bit forward.
考虑到普天间位于人口稠密的市区 — — 该地区有100多个学校、医院和商店，批评家们断言“鱼鹰”计划会危及到岛上成千上万居民的生命。	Given that Futenma is located in a densely-populated urban area that includes more than 100 schools, hospitals, and shops, critics contend that the Osprey would endanger the lives of thousands of island residents.
在对器官买卖的调查中，我进入到某些影子市场，穷人、战争受害者和犯人的身体器官在这里成为商品，通过买卖或盗窃等方式移植到富有的患者身上。	In my research on organ trafficking, I have entered some of these shadow markets, where body parts from the poor, war victims, and prisoners are commodities, bought or stolen for transplant into affluent ill people.
在今年的达沃斯世界经济论坛年会上，许多人对特朗普减税和放松管制的承诺表示赞扬，同时忙不迭地忽略他的偏见 — — 在我出席的所有分会议中都没人提及 — — 和保护主义。	At this year’s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, many salivated over his promises of tax cuts and deregulation, while eagerly ignoring his bigotry – not mentioning it in a single meeting that I attended – and protectionism.
我们知道什么能够巩固和平社会：收入分配公平、尊重少数派权利、高教育水平、低腐败水平以及有吸引力的商业环境。	We know what underpins peaceful societies: an equitable distribution of income, respect for minority rights, high education standards, low levels of corruption, and an attractive business environment.
2006年，记者安娜·波利科夫斯卡娅（Anna Politkovskaya）在电梯中遭枪杀，前克格勃特工、普京的关键人物亚历山大·利特维年科（Alexander Litvinenko）在伦敦逃亡期间死于钋中毒。	In 2006, the journalist Anna Politkovskaya was gunned down in an elevator, and Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB agent who had been critical of Putin, died of polonium poison while in exile in London.
从一开始，两方面都预期会有一场决定性的斗争。 这一斗争发生在去年十一月、政府决定把公务员的退休年龄与私有企业拉齐之后。	From the outset, both sides expected a defining fight, which occurred last November, after the government decided to align the retirement age in the public sector with that of the private sector.
比如，去年有400,000多人死于疟疾，用于对付携带疟疾的蚊虫的驱虫蚊帐有效期高达两到三年，而其制造和销售成本还不到10美元。	For example, while malaria killed more than 400,000 people last year, insecticidal nets to guard against malaria-carrying mosquitoes are effective for two to three years, and cost less than $10 to manufacture and distribute.
共和党人害怕他们可能同时失去参众两院，虽然鉴于更多民主党在职议员必须保住自己的席位，失去参议院的情况不大可能发生。	Republicans have been in a panic that they might lose both the House and the Senate, though the latter is less likely, given that many more Democratic than Republican incumbents must defend their seats.
目前，美国已经对钢和铝分别征收25%和10%的高额进口关税，这是特朗普个人在上个月月初就宣布要做的事。	So far, the US has imposed sweeping import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, which Trump personally announced early last month.
一位美国政治顾问迪克·莫里斯（Dick Morris）凭经验总结说 ： “ 魅力是政治特征中最难以捉摸的部分，因为它并不是任何实质性的存在；只有在一位候选人通过勤奋和某些巧妙的议题将其创造出来后，它才会出现于我们的观念之中 。 ”	Dick Morris, an American political consultant, reports that in his experience, “charisma is the most elusive of political traits, because it doesn’t exist in reality; only in our perception once a candidate has made it by hard work and good issues.”
据詹姆斯·麦迪逊大学宗教研究教授艾伦·莱文诺维茨（Alan Levinovitz）看来，特朗普在推特中使用大写的次数堪与过去几百年中坑蒙拐骗普罗大众的“老军医”和神棍相比。	According to Alan Levinovitz, a professor of religious studies at James Madison University, Trump uses capitalization in his tweets much as medical quacks and religious charlatans did in their efforts to bamboozle the public in centuries past.
要求政府测试动用武力决定的事实依据并不是一个应当抛弃的枷锁，而是鼓励深谋远虑以及在心理上让人安心的支持。	Requiring the government to test the factual basis of its decision to use force is not a shackle to be thrown off, but an incentive for forethought and a psychologically stabilizing support.
一位邻居说 ， “ 奇怪的”帕多克“不与人来往 ” ； 和他住隔壁“就像挨着空气住 ” ， 这强化了独来独往叙事。	Reinforcing the loner trope, one neighbor said that the “weird” Paddock “kept to himself”; living next to him was “like living next to nothing.”
接着，朝鲜要求日本给予粮食和经济援助，作为交换，朝鲜不但可以遣返日本所要求的日籍亲眷，甚至还可以释放被朝鲜羁押的七名日本人。	North Korea then asked Japan for economic aid and food supplies in exchange for returning not only the Japanese wives in question, but also seven Japanese known to have been abducted by the North.
在其名为“银行地下室”的博客里（它迅速成为了英国央行最有趣味的发布窗口 ） ， 您可以找到对风险溢价演变的分析。	On its “Bank Underground” blog, which is fast becoming the most interesting of the BoE’s publications, you can find analysis of the evolution of risk premia.
这些基于市场的改革，再加上强劲的公共投资，能够加速经济增长和多样化，同时保护古巴在卫生、教育和社会服务方面取得的成就。	Such market-based reforms, combined with robust public investment, could speed economic growth and diversification, while protecting Cuba’s achievements in health, education, and social services.
该组织将预算缩减，并减小规模，而当新的责任（特别是对“货币操控”执行监控职责）同时赋予给该组织时，其深思熟虑更证明其很大程度上无力胜任。	It shrank its budgets and began to downsize, and, while it was handed some new responsibilities in the meantime – surveillance over “currency manipulation,” in particular – its deliberations proved largely irrelevant.
基于此，以色列阿拉伯人对于以色列作为犹太和民主国家的合法性的认同度，2015年高达53.6 % ， 仅仅两年后就下降到49.1%或许并不足为奇。	Given this, it is perhaps unsurprising that Israeli Arabs’ recognition of Israel’s legitimacy as a Jewish and democratic state fell from 53.6% in 2015 to 49.1% just two years later.
本文作者之一提出了一个效仿巴黎气候协定的公约：有约束力的首要目标与志愿性质的国家行动计划和灵活的实现手段相结合。	One of the authors of this article proposed a convention modeled after the Paris climate agreement: a binding overarching goal combined with voluntary national action plans and flexible measures to achieve them.
已故的麻省理工学院经济学家鲁迪格·多恩布什（Rüdiger Dornbusch）常常戏谑说，识别资本外逃就好比是盲人摸象：你很难描述它，但你看到它的时候你能认得出。	As the late MIT economist Rüdiger Dornbusch liked to quip, identifying capital flight is akin to the old adage about blind men touching an elephant: It is difficult to describe, but you will recognize it when you see it.
国际社会的大部分成员 — — 令人瞩目的是，现有核力量和它们的军事盟友不在其列 — — 反复呼吁在2017年实施禁止核武器条约，以此实现核裁军。	Most of the international community – with the conspicuous exception of the existing nuclear powers and their military allies – reiterated the call for nuclear disarmament by adopting in 2017 the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
其他地方，尤其是在美国，私人资助的聚变研究如雨后春笋般不断涌出。 这些项目各有被誉为“能量圣杯”的独特理念。	Elsewhere, particularly in the US, privately funded fusion ventures are springing up like mushrooms, each with its own concept for what some call the Holy Grail of energy.
确实，尽管穆沙拉夫表现出某种大城市的形象，喜欢喝苏格兰威士忌酒而且崇拜土耳其，但是他并非印度的自由派人士所崇敬的巴基斯坦世俗派人士。	Indeed, though Musharraf displayed an urbane image, enjoyed his Scotch, and admired Turkey, he was not one of the Pakistani secularists so admired by Indian liberals.
想必人人都希望增长能够提高，但不幸的是，当政客言及增长时，他们的意思通常是应该允许他们背负更多的债务。	Supposedly, everyone just wants more growth; unfortunately, when politicians talk about growth, what they usually mean is that they should be permitted to incur more public debt.
信服显得问题与近几十年来的争论问题大相径庭，我们可以从中感受到决定未来经济进步（以及经济政策）讨论的概念框架的变化。	The emerging questions are sufficiently different from those of recent decades that one can sense a shift in the conceptual framework that will structure the discussion of economic progress – and economic policy – from now on.
虽然无论发什么誓，每个行业都会有一些害群之马，但许多卫生保健方面的专业人士确实认定自己是要为顾客利益最大化服务的。	Every profession will have its rogues, of course, no matter what oaths are sworn, but many health care professionals have a real commitment to serving the best interests of their clients.
但是，世界各地许多中央银行公开的借贷工具，应该能缓和这些担忧，特别是对大型而且资产良好的银行来说更是如此。	But the many central bank lending facilities that have been opened around the world should assuage these concerns, especially for large and well-capitalized banks.
毫无疑问，民粹主义的复兴受到了欧盟机构的默默无声（anonymity）的推波助澜，这一安排与传统的提供福利的民族国家机构形成了对比。	Populism’s resurgence has no doubt been aided by the anonymity of EU institutions, in contrast to the traditional welfare-providing institutions of the nation-state.
只有当后阿拉法特时代的领导人下定决心、真心希望在所有领域结束冲突、建立巴勒斯坦国，真正的和平机会才会出现。	Only if the post-Arafat movement decides that it really wants a Palestinian state in exchange for ending the conflict with Israel in every respect will there be a real chance of peace.
在向伊拉克和阿富汗派军使美国国防预算吃紧，且许多现役设备都需要维修和更新的时候，在这些项目上投资是否明智就是值得考量了。	At a time when deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are straining the defense budget and much of the military’s existing equipment needs repair or replacement, questions arise as to whether such programs are a good investment.
由于禁止古兰经的印刷，奥斯曼领导人延迟了誊写员和书法家（其中不少是因为掌握这门技艺而备受推崇的女性）的就业损失。	By banning the printing of the Koran, Ottoman leaders delayed employment losses for scribes and calligraphers (many of whom were women who were glorified for their mastery of the art).
也许我们的复杂性的长期进化代价太大了，我们作为一个物种能够生存下来，最终取决于我们通过越来越复杂的治疗方案降低健康成本的能力。	Perhaps the long-term evolutionary cost of our complexity is too high, with our survival as a species ultimately depending on our ability to mitigate its fitness cost through increasingly arduous therapeutic solutions.
但是有些欧洲人更偏好希拉里·克林顿甚至是麦凯恩，因为他们对于一位更为节制、经验并不老道的总统对美国的欧洲夥伴带来的影响感到担心。	But some Europeans prefer Hillary Clinton or even John McCain, because they are apprehensive about the consequences for America’s European partners of a more restrained and less experienced president.
三个最重要的东南亚国家 — — 马来西亚、泰国和现在的印度尼西亚 — — 最近几个月来在这方面给自己制造了麻烦。	Three of Southeast Asia's most important states – Malaysia, Thailand, and now Indonesia – have brought trouble on themselves in this respect in recent months.
在公投运动中，民族主义不仅激发了种族主义者的本能，还激发了民粹主义阴谋论，嘲笑了信奉这些理论的专家和机构。	During the referendum campaign, nationalism aroused not only racist instincts, but also populist conspiracy theories that derided experts and the institutions that house them.
汽车公司正在认识到，假以时日，它们所生产汽车的车内数字体验将占据更大的消费者剩余比例，这主要是拜可观的利润率和规模经济所赐。	Automotive companies are recognizing that, over time, the digital experience in the cars they produce will command a larger share of the consumer surplus, owing largely to the potential for substantial profit margins and economies of scale.
2014年，贝齐格-赫尔（Betzig-Hell）显微镜被授予诺贝尔奖，因为它克服了曾经被认为不可逾越的障碍，让光学显微范围挺进到纳米级。	In 2014, the builders of the Betzig-Hell microscope were awarded a Nobel Prize for overcoming an obstacle that had previously been considered insurmountable, bringing optical microscopy into the nanodimension.
世行不能仅仅推动它的议程，而是应该开始对它的技术建议按照渐进标准收取费用，这样，它的更多的项目才会是以客户为导向的。	Instead of merely pushing its agenda, the Bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client-driven.
妇女的经济解放则要等到第二次世界大战之后，男性劳动力的长期短缺 — — 凯恩斯主义充分就业政策的偶然结果 — — 促使更多妇女走出家门，走入工厂和商店。	The economic emancipation of women had to wait till after World War II, when permanent male labor shortages – the result, incidentally, of Keynesian full-employment policies – pulled ever more women out of domesticity and into factories and shops.
但欧洲构筑的堡垒并未阻止、只是改变了人流，迫使移民和难民在缩减搜索救援行动的情况下尝试危险的海上偷渡。	But the fortress has merely rechanneled, rather than stemmed, the flow of people, forcing migrants and refugees to attempt dangerous sea crossings – even as search and rescue operations are being scaled back.
在布雷顿森林体系崩溃后的十年里，IMF重新化身为1970年代石油价格震荡所带来的储备盈余的首要管理机构。	In the years after the collapse of Bretton Woods, the IMF reinvented itself as a principle vehicle for managing the surpluses that followed the oil price shocks of the 1970’s.
在尼日利亚，前总统奥卢塞贡·奥巴桑乔就拥有一个从事多种经营的巨大农场，并推行一系列政策来帮助那些远程农夫成功创业。	In Nigeria, former President Olusegun Obasanjo has a huge diversified farm and has pushed for policies to help absentee farmers prosper.
但是，尽管基础设施已经实现了现代化，中国国内物流成本仍占生产成本的18 % ， 而美国只占10 % ， 这是由多种多样的内部低效率导致的。	But, despite modern infrastructure, logistical costs within China are 18% of production costs, compared with 10% in the US, owing to various internal inefficiencies.
从大部分美国人的收入停滞了十五年的情况看来，不管官方的GDP数据怎么说，显然美国的经济模式并不能给大部分公民带来益处。	With most Americans’ incomes stagnating for a decade and a half, it was clear that the US economic model was not delivering for most citizens, whatever official GDP data said.
如今，叙利亚逊尼派已经揭竿而起反抗阿拉维派统治者，基督徒对阿拉维派政权的忠诚变成了一种负担甚至危险。	Now that Syria’s Sunnis have risen up against their Alawite rulers, Christians’ loyalty to the regime has become a liability, even a danger.
如果一种非连续性的汇率升值要成为连续性的，它就必须反映预期的货币政策：升值国的银根和通货紧缩，与贬值国的银根放松与通货膨胀。	If a discrete exchange-rate appreciation is to be sustained, it must reflect expected monetary policies: tight money and deflation in the appreciated country, and easy money with inflation in the depreciated country.
相反，它们反映了变化的全球政治日程，在这个日程中，巴勒斯坦问题的重要性已经推举次席，这可能削弱以色列反思其镇压巴勒斯坦的行为的激励。	On the contrary, they reflect a changing global political agenda that has relegated the question to a lower tier of importance, which is likely to weaken Israel’s incentive to rethink its suppression of Palestine.
但作为一个外国人，该国游说团体那种明目张胆的程度，还有企业及其同业公会所花费的巨额资金都令我感到非常吃惊。	But, as an outsider, I am amazed at the apparent intensity of lobbying, and at the amounts of money that firms and their associations spend.
在英国，通常社会阶级仍决定着一个人的命运，作为来自北方的杂货店老板之女��她成功跻身牛津大学，成为一名主修化学的女生。	In a Britain where social class still typically determined one’s destiny, the grocer’s daughter from the north made her way to Oxford and starred as a student of chemistry.
因此，经济的“经济组合 ” （ economic mix）间远离投资，而已然萎靡不振的增长将会放缓。	The “economic mix” of the economy would thus shift away from investment; and growth, already anemic, would slow.
直接或间接主宰新加坡半个多世纪的李光耀直到91岁逝世前都极富影响力 — — 他的掌权时间超过了大多数人。	Lee Kuan Yew, who presided over Singapore either directly or indirectly for more than a half-century – remaining influential right up to his death at 91 – had more time in power than most to do so.
但摩擦力产生热量并因此导致熵的增加 — — 熵代表一种测量在动力学方面不能做功的能量总数 — — 并因此将过去和未来区分开来。	Yet friction produces heat and thus an increase in entropy – which measures the amount of energy that cannot be used to perform work – and it therefore distinguishes past from future.
美国肯定会试图制裁上述企业，通过针对他们在当地的分支机构，或者将他们拖入美国法院，再或者禁止他们进入美国市场。	The US will certainly try to punish such companies, whether by targeting their local subsidiaries, by trying to haul them into US courts, or by denying them access to the US market.
过去几个月在与几个国家的立法者探讨这一问题后，我清楚的意识到很多人对于需要考虑的问题并不具备十足的把握。	After exploring this issue with legislators in several countries over the past couple of months, it has become abundantly clear that many do not have a full grasp of the myriad issues that need to be considered.
与此同时，著名波兰制片人阿格涅丝卡·霍兰德发表强烈抗议，反对自由媒体将皮奥特的抗议归结为精神病的结果。	Meanwhile, the renowned Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland issued a strong rebuke against liberal media outlets that would attribute Piotr’s protest to mental illness.
个中原因非常复杂：比如说付出巨大“生命和财产”代价的十年大中东战争；金融经济危机；巨额公共债务；调整定位转向国内问题；以及太平洋事务成为新的焦点。	There have been many causes: a decade of war in the greater Middle East, with its enormous cost in “blood and treasure”; the financial and economic crisis; high public debt; reorientation toward internal problems; and a new focus on Pacific affairs.
但即便如此，美日之间依然存在更深层次的违和感 — — 尽管很少公开表达 — — 但这与日本担心美国转向中国后自己遭到边缘化有关。	There was a deeper level of malaise, however, and although it was rarely expressed openly, it related to the Japanese concern that it would be marginalized as the US turned toward China.
2015到2016年间，奥尔班政府斥资超过5，000亿欧元（合5，900亿美元）投入反移民广告，其中包括设立广告牌警告移民不要抢夺本地人的工作。	Between 2015 and 2016, his government spent more than €50 million ($59 million) on anti-immigrant advertisements, including billboards warning immigrants not to take natives’ jobs.
国际谈判的成功取决于各方 — — 以及他们所代表的人民 — — 如何看待关键的公平原则，特别是历史责任和等人均权利。	Success in international negotiations will hinge on how parties – and the citizens they represent – consider a few vital equity principles, especially historical responsibility and equal per capita rights.
从基什内尔当选的2003年到其妻子兼继任者克里斯蒂娜·费尔南德兹·基什内尔以压倒性优势赢得连任的2011年，大豆价格平均每年上涨超过7 % ， 刺激了总体GDP增长。	From 2003, the year of Kirchner’s election, to 2011, when his wife and successor Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was elected to her second term in a landslide, soybean prices rose by more than 7% annually, on average, boosting overall GDP growth.
他们更需要社会给他们有一个更为宽松的环境，让他们自由着装，更加自由地消费电影，音乐等文化产品。 他们需要更多的新闻自由。	They also want a more liberal social environment that would loosen restrictions on their dress, broaden access to cultural products like film and music, and enlarge press freedoms.
如果俄罗斯军队越过边界，不管寻找什么借口，都会引起西方反应的强烈升级；如果俄罗斯采取暗中政治动摇的方针，那么西方的压力将积累得更加缓 — — 仍在积累，只是慢一些。	The West’s response will intensify dramatically if Russia deploys forces across its borders, whatever the pretext; should Russia adopt subtler methods of political destabilization, Western pressure will build more gradually, but build it will.
阻止量化宽松在欧元区起作用的另一个因素是债券收益率低迷。 这一现象增加了退休基金的记录赤字，使得一些公司不愿投资，也更容易导致退休金缴费率的提高和退休金数量的限制。	Another factor impeding QE’s impact in the eurozone is low bond yields, which, by increasing measured pension-fund deficits, make some companies reluctant to invest and thus more likely to raise contribution rates and limit pension benefits.
但主要原因是拙劣的公共政策：非洲政府没有遏制农商企业和大型食品制造商的权力，缺乏监督导致本地农业竞争力低下。	But the primary cause is poor public policy: African governments have failed to curb the power of agribusinesses and large food producers, a lack of oversight that has made local agriculture less competitive.
就此而言，它也没有让德国政策的渐行渐远—例如通过拒绝在当下的危机中承担领导责任表现出来—有更好的托词。	As such, this does not makes the drift in German policy – which manifests itself, for example, in a refusal to lead in the present crisis – any better.
如果美国最终开征该关税项，虽然美加贸易的不平衡状态有所缓解，但关税会伤害美国建筑商，房屋拥有者以及加拿大的木材企业。	If the US does impose such tariffs, the result would be a reduction in the US-Canada trade imbalance. But the tariffs would hurt American builders and homeowners, as well as Canadian timber companies.
德国仍然只愿为保住欧元付出最低限度的努力（仅此而已、别无其他 ） ， 而欧盟近来的举措只是强化了德国对更多让步要求的抵触立场。	Germany remains willing to do the minimum – and nothing more – to hold the euro together, and the EU’s recent steps have merely reinforced German resistance to further concessions.
考虑到1970年代的财政过度支出状况以及控制公共支出的必要性，所谓的市场中立性逐渐取代了政府干预而成为了纳税人资金的分配机制。	Given the fiscal excesses of the 1970s and the need to control public spending, the alleged neutrality of the market was preferred to government intervention as a mechanism to allocate taxpayers’ money.
这实际上也是奥巴马政府所信奉的箴言，但这不仅引起了经济学界的普遍反对，甚至连其经济顾问委员会主席克里斯蒂娜·罗默（Christina Romer）也不支持。	This is practically the mantra of US President Barack Obama’s administration, and it has cost him the support not only of much of the economics profession, but also of Christina Romer, who chaired his Council of Economic Advisers.
同样，政坛人物着急地说，到2050年的时候北极熊的数量将会大幅度减少。 然而他们只是利用这一点来支持减少二氧化碳排放，却没有告诉我们这样做对于北极熊的数量没有可以衡量的效果。	Likewise, when politicians fret that we will lose a significant proportion of polar bears by 2050, they use it as an argument for cutting carbon, but forget to tell us that doing so will have no measurable effect on polar bear populations.
如今，在许多欧元区国家 ， “ 财政保守派”是一个很有力量的集团，他们坚持政府需要增加收入，同时控制支出。	In many eurozone countries today, “fiscal conservatives” are a powerful group, insisting on the need to boost government revenue while bringing spending under control.
国家主体要想找到方案，就有必要缓解紧张局势并实现妥协 — — 先是全球层面在美俄之间，后是地区层面，涉及伊朗、土耳其、沙特阿拉伯和以色列。	For national actors to have space to find solutions, it is necessary to de-escalate tensions and find compromises – first globally, between the US and Russia, and then regionally, among Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.
如果那么多的中国高级官员都能公然捞取可疑的文凭且无需承担任何后果，可想而知其他形式的腐败该有多么广泛。	If so many senior Chinese officials openly flaunt fraudulent or dubious academic degrees without consequences, one can imagine how widespread other forms of corruption must be.
在不到三年的时间里，这一颇受欢迎的在线资源已经从一个受人尊重、由美国人创办的新兴实体转化为一个可疑的、莫斯科控制的企业。 克里姆林宫宠爱的寡头们也共同拥有这一企业。	In less than three years, this popular online resource has been transformed from a respectable American start-up to a shady Moscow-based enterprise, co-owned by the Kremlin’s favorite oligarchs.
而在5,000万被迫逃离祖国或在国内流离失所的儿童中有一大半是被迫离开家园，并面临着生命和福利的新威胁。	And of the 50 million children who live outside their own countries or have been internally displaced, more than half have been forcibly uprooted, and are facing new threats to their lives and well-being.
相反，它们应该努力让自身成为了许多不同价值链中的一个节点，这就需要去在某种程度上扩展并适应新的需要,使得其他产业能利用自身已有的生产能力。	Instead, they should worry about being a node in many different value chains, which requires finding other industries that can use their existing capabilities if they were somehow expanded and adjusted to new needs.
安弟斯山区，亚洲中部和非洲的经济萧条会导致全球的不稳定、地区反抗和暴力事件、毒品走私、以及成为恐怖分子的基地。	The failures of economic development in the Andes, Central Asia, and Africa contribute to global instability, local insurrections and violence, drug trafficking, and bases for terrorism.
低利率最终猛然通过住房价格泡沫启动了扩张，这一泡沫支撑了通过债务融资的消费者狂购并且引发了建筑业繁荣。	Low interest rates eventually jump-started the expansion through a house price bubble that supported a debt-financed consumer-spending binge and triggered a construction boom.
如果特朗普得逞，墨西哥的北部边境将出现一堵“美丽的高墙 ” ， 对墨西哥经济至关重要的北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）也将重新谈判，以满足“美国优先”的要求。	If Trump gets his way, Mexico’s northern border will feature a “big, beautiful wall,” and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is crucial to Mexico’s economy, will be renegotiated to satisfy an “America first” agenda.
除削减预算和冻结公共部门费用外 — — 上述两项举措无论如何都不会受到欢迎 — — 马克龙还试图改革法国的劳动法。	In addition to budget cuts and a public-sector pay freeze – neither of which would be popular under any circumstances – Macron is trying to reform France’s labor code.
他们相信他们找到了用模式方法精确预估货币交易者如何考虑以后的情形，因此他们就认为没有干预的必要，因为，除了暂时的脱离，市场总是合理决定了各种货币价值。	Believing that they have found a way to model precisely how currency traders should think about the future, they see no need for intervention because, save for temporary deviations, markets always get currency values right.
但这一协议将让纳税人花费700万美元，并且家庭采暖和空IT奥设备制造商开利公司仍会将1,300个岗位外包给墨西哥。	Yet the deal will cost taxpayers $7 million, and still allow Carrier to outsource 1,300 jobs to Mexico.
这意味着，首先，从巴基斯坦驻扎在阿富汗1,600英里边境的有50,000人的战斗部队开始，提高边境部队的安全保卫训练。	That means, first, improving security training for the border forces, starting with Pakistan’s Frontier Corps, the 50,000-man combat force along the 1,600-mile Afghan border.
此外你还可以为不同的时段开出不同的价格：在奥运期间，租我在伦敦的房子要2万美元，而在圣诞节期间则要1万美元，其他时间只要1千美元就够了。	And you can post different prices for different times: $20,000 to rent my house in London during the Olympics, $10,000 over Christmas, or $1,000 any other time.
在这一观点周围逐渐形成了一种共识，呼吁向集约型、效率推动型增长转变，这一呼声在2011年中国GDP增长出现减速后更加高涨了。	A consensus has gradually emerged around this idea, with calls for a shift toward intensive, efficiency-driven growth intensifying since China’s GDP growth began to slow in 2011.
英国政府最近发布了迄今为止关于全球变暖的经济成本和风险最为全面的研究报告，并提出了可能减少温室气体排放的措施，希望藉此避免一些最可怕的后果。	The British government recently issued the most comprehensive study to date of the economic costs and risks of global warming, and of measures that might reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the hope of averting some of the direst consequences.
如果与戈登的论点相反，今天的技术真的能够大幅提高生产率，则投资回报也将上升（除非劳动力以更高的工资的形式获得了全部收益，没人认为这有可能 ） 。	If, controverting Gordon’s thesis, today’s technologies do boost productivity significantly, the return on investment would rise (unless labor receives all of the gains in the form of higher wages, an outcome that nobody expects).
原因不是外围地区提供了资本可以从中获利的具有吸引力的劳动力，而是核心地区－特别是美国－为资本免于没有预料到的政治动乱提供了一种保护。	The reason is not that the periphery offers an attractive labor force from which capital profits, but rather that the core – especially the United States – offers a form of protection for capital against unanticipated political disturbances.
希腊骚乱活动的蔓延使人们注意到了南欧国家 — — 西班牙、意大利和希腊 — — 以及爱尔兰所面临的困境。	Widespread riots in Greece drew attention to the plight of the Southern Tier countries— Spain, Italy and Greece— and of Ireland.
尽管特伦的观点是正确的，但美联储参与国际谈判的权限并不意味着它必须这样做，而新的任命人选可能会认为美联储不应该这么做。	While Yellen’s arguments are correct, the Fed’s entitlement to participate in international negotiations does not oblige it to do so, and a new appointee might argue that it should not.
当然，形成如此结果的关键是美国情报部门报告说所有证据表明伊朗很久以前 — — 2003年 — — 就放弃了发展核武器的实质计划。	Critical to that outcome, of course, was the US intelligence community’s reports that all the evidence pointed to Iran having long ago – in 2003 – abandoned concrete plans to develop a nuclear weapon.
同样地在巴基斯坦，寄希望于这个国家赞成民主的律师、知识分子和学生会在动乱和对街头政治潜在的大屠杀中最终走向胜利是很危险的。	Similarly in Pakistan, it is dangerous to bet that the country’s pro-democracy lawyers, intellectuals, and students will emerge victorious in the tumult and potential carnage of street politics.
也很少有美国人意识到，人质危机的导火索是美国的决策失误 — — 允许被废黜的沙入境美国治病。 许多伊朗人将此视为对伊斯兰革命的威胁。	Nor do most Americans realize that the hostage crisis was precipitated by the ill-considered decision to admit the deposed Shah into the US for medical treatment, which many Iranians viewed as a threat to the revolution.
宾夕法尼亚大学的试验疗法导致了病人的死亡，病人名叫Jesse Gelsinger，死亡时间：1999年下半年。	An experiment at the University of Pennsylvania resulted in the death of the patient, Jesse Gelsinger, in late 1999.
上周，她和意大利、希腊、法国、奥地利、保加利亚以及荷兰领导人举行了会晤，她需要他们帮助限制欧盟内部寻求庇护者的转移。	And last week, she met with the leaders of Italy, Greece, France, Austria, Bulgaria, and the Netherlands, whose help she needs to restrict the movement of asylum seekers within the EU.
他警告说“如果你坐视通胀预期远超（通胀控制）目标，最后等着你的肯定是相当棘手的难题，还要经历一个耗资巨大的过程才能使其降回到原先的目标水平 。 ”	He warned that, “if you let inflation expectations drift too far away from the target, you can end up in quite serious difficulty with a costly process to bring them back again.”
发自马萨诸塞州剑桥市 — — 人们往往很难理解，为何那些原本把经济处理得相当好的国家最终会把局面搞得一片混乱。	CAMBRIDGE, MA – It is often difficult to understand how countries that are dealt a pretty good economic hand can end up making a major mess of things.
对美国来说，中国实力的增长实际上有助于证明其在亚洲增兵、维持该地区已有盟友关系以及争取新战略伙伴的必要性。	For the US, China’s growing power actually helps to validate its forward military deployments in Asia, maintain existing allies in the region, and win new strategic partners.
在飞机制造商可以生产和销售新机型之前，它们需要花费数十亿美元、数十年时间用于研发 — — 这些成本必须在日后收回。	Before aircraft manufacturers can produce and sell a new airplane model, they must spend billions of dollars over a decade or more of development – costs that must later be recouped.
很难想象以色列能在巴以问题上转变态度，而奥巴马政府摆脱国内政治弊端、不再在巴以问题上添乱似乎也已经为时晚矣。	It is difficult to imagine Israel’s leadership changing course at this stage, and it is probably too late for the Obama administration to escape from the domestic political vice in which it seems pinned on this issue.
非洲人赚钱和存钱的能力决定了他能获得好医疗还是根本看不起病，因此这是一个被错过的帮助患者、构建恢复力更强的社会的机会。	Because Africans’ ability to earn and save money can be the difference between good care and no care at all, this represents a missed opportunity to help patients and build more resilient communities.
特别是，领导人必须展现三大关键品质才能赢得有效领导所需要的信任：目标（purpose ） 、 公平（impartiality）和胜任力（competence ） 。	In particular, leaders must display three key qualities to win the trust needed to lead effectively: purpose, impartiality, and competence.
再加上埃及自1990年以来都未曾入围过世界杯决赛圈，导致人们的预期远远超出了球队在小组赛中实际可以实现的目标。	Add to that the fact that Egypt had not qualified for a World Cup final since 1990, and expectations ended up far exceeding what the team could realistically achieve in the tournament.
首先，他为核武器辩护，认为它是地区或全球稳定之源，这大大低估了核武器落入恐怖分子之手或因为误算而使用的危险。	First, by defending nuclear weapons as a source of regional or global stability, he profoundly underestimated the danger that they could fall into the hands of terrorists or be used because of a miscalculation.
但随着世界各国经济联系日趋紧密，一个全球层面的产权基础设施体系也已经初具规模，并使得建立有效的国家层面的产权基础设施和准确的价格发现机制显得更加重要。	But, as the world economy has become increasingly interconnected, a global property-rights infrastructure (PRI) has emerged – further raising the stakes of developing effective national PRIs and accurate price-discovery mechanisms.
特朗普身上一个最引人关注的特点是他自身的无知，尽管他受过高等教育，以及他从炫耀自己的无知中获益这一事实。	One of the most remarkable things about Trump is the extent of his own ignorance, despite his high educational attainment, and the fact that he seems to benefit from flaunting it.
欧洲生活着一千多万罗姆人，大部分集中在巴尔干地区和欧盟最新成员国，特别是罗马尼亚、保加利亚、斯洛伐克和匈牙利。	There are more than ten million Roma living in Europe, mostly concentrated in the Balkans and in the European Union’s newest member states, especially Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Hungary.
现在没人知道特朗普会后劲十足还是昙花一现，但有一点十分明确：他并非为提名竞赛注入怪异元素的唯一候选人。	No one knows right now whether Trump will flame out or prove to have staying power, but one thing is clear: he is not the only one injecting strangeness into the nomination contest.
平心而论，IPCC的最新评估报告强调了大幅削减二氧化碳排放以避免超出全球小型（但仍然十分危险）碳预算的紧迫性。	To be fair, the IPCC’s latest assessment report highlights the imperative of cutting CO2 emissions drastically to avoid exceeding the world’s small – and still risky – carbon budget.
虽然美国和中国是世界上两大主要的温室气体排放国，美国的排放量位居世界第一，但是双方都没有签署京都协定书。 京都协定书要求参与国到2008-2012年时将碳排放量与1990年相比降低5 % 。	Although the US and China are the world’s two primary producers of greenhouse gases – the US being the largest – neither has signed the Kyoto Protocol, which commits countries to cut carbon emissions 5% below 1990 levels by 2008-12.
香港—几十年来，城市化的快速发展使中国出现了一批知识和制造业集中的大都会，它们大多坐落在能很好地与全球经济相连的区域。	HONG KONG – For decades, rapid urbanization in China created clusters of knowledge, manufacturing, and distribution in areas that benefited from well-established connections to the global economy.
对美国公众来说，美国外交人员被激进的伊朗学生绑架并虐待444天是一次奇耻大辱，其所造成的心理冲击至今仍未消退。	For the US public, the 444-day ordeal of the US embassy staff held hostage by radical Iranian students constituted a psychological shock that has still not abated.
如果中国领导人继续选择债务驱动型增长优先、压倒改革，也只能推迟 — — 可能时间很长 — — 不可避免的减速。	If China’s leaders continue to choose debt-fueled growth over reform, they will only delay, and possibly prolong, the inevitable slowdown.
华盛顿—被弹劾的巴西总统罗塞夫已经下台，清理巴西宏观经济乱局的担子落在了新掌权的总统特梅尔政府肩上。	WASHINGTON, DC – Now that impeached Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is out of office, it is up to the newly empowered administration of President Michel Temer to clean up Brazil’s macroeconomic mess.
但在8月6日，总理莫迪终于打破了他个人在这个问题上的沉默，警告人们提防那些试图挑起社会冲突的假冒神牛保护者（Gau Rakshaks ） 。	But on August 6, Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally broke his silence on the issue, warning people to beware of the fake Gau Rakshaks (protectors of cows) who are trying to create social conflict.
为了避免这一命运，各国政府应当逐步认识到整个系统早已有了应对深刻危机的一套方法，而且任何人力都无法改变。	To avoid that fate, governments should start by recognizing that the system is programmed to respond to deep distress, and that they can do nothing about it.
但尽管人民党妖魔化印度穆斯林和基督教徒的做法可能争取到短期的政治利益，但却可能在多元化社会埋下长期的危险因素。	But while the BJP’s demonization of India’s Muslims and Christians might serve its short-term political interests, it implies long-term dangers in a plural society.
比如，许多国家都有抑制大型汽车的税收和监管规定 — — 并非是为了区别对待美国产品，而是出于污染和能源效率考虑。	For example, many countries have tax and regulatory provisions that discourage large automobiles – not because they are trying to discriminate against US goods, but because they worry about pollution and energy efficiency.
今天的波兰人已经很难接受在2007年似乎还足够的工资，目前波兰的名义工资是德国的三分之一，而2007年却仅有德国的四分之一。	In today’s Poland, it is harder to accept wages – nominally about a third of those in Germany – that had seemed perfectly adequate in 2007, when they were only a quarter of the German level.
人力资本的升级以及机会均等的提升应该在欧盟下一个多年金融框架的谈判中发挥重要作用，而欧洲投资银行也可以对此提供支持。	Human-capital upgrading and more equality of opportunity should play a prominent role in negotiations over the EU’s next Multiannual Financial Framework, with the European Investment Bank possibly also providing support.
发展中国家扭曲的税收、补贴或食品及能源价格监管政策往往对改善收入分配不太有效，并且往往产生相反的效果。	In developing countries, distortionary measures that tax, subsidize, or regulate food and energy prices tend to be poor tools for improving income distribution, and frequently have the opposite effect.
俄罗斯是1945年后极少数从未与日本签订和平条约的国家之一，因为在二战末期，苏联占领了当时属于日本、位于北海道以北、日本国最东北端的四个岛屿。	Russia is one of the few countries with which Japan never signed a peace treaty after 1945, because in the war’s final days, the Soviet Union occupied four then-Japanese islands just north of Hokkaido, the country’s northernmost main island.
在肯尼亚，由经合组织领导的无国界税收督察项目发现与当局合作打击避税行为每投入1美元，就能带来1，290美元的增量收入。	In Kenya, Tax Inspectors Without Borders, a project led by the OECD, found that every dollar spent working with authorities on cracking down on tax avoidance produced $1,290 in increased revenues.
如果韦尔比的例子符合罗马天主教的教义，那么还有一个更深层的问题，亦即罗马天主教育如此的教义是否恰当？	If the Welby case falls on the right side of the line drawn by Roman Catholic doctrine, the deeper question is whether Church doctrine draws the line in a place that makes sense.
联邦政府不再阔气到抛洒数十亿美元援助外国政府，而中国远比美国更加集中化，也不必像美国那样对纳税人负责。	The federal government no longer has billions of dollars to dole out to foreign governments, while China is far more centralized and less beholden to its taxpayers.
特朗普坚持迎合民族主义和仇外（特别是反穆斯林）群体，而不是推进美国真正的国家安全利益，也将导致风险增加。	Trump’s insistence on playing to his nationalist and xenophobic (and, specifically, anti-Muslim) base, instead of advancing the real national security interests of the US, heightens the risk.
但如果油田的所有者们认为油价在长期来看会呈下跌之势，他们现在便会有动力开发石油并扩大生产以求在跌价之前卖出更多的石油。	But if owners of oil reserves think that prices will fall in the long run, they gain an incentive to explore for oil and expand production now in order to sell as much oil as possible before the fall.
黎巴嫩民众享有的个人自由赋予这个国家一种特殊的适应性，而中东地区所有的年轻人都羡慕这个国家拥有的文化活力。	The personal freedoms that Lebanese citizens enjoy give their country a special resilience, and its cultural dynamism is the envy of young people throughout the Middle East.
经济体学习的速度可以超过其创造的速度，所以欠发达国家相比今天的工业化国家，在向富裕的道路迈进时，前者比后者的成长速度更快。	Economies can learn faster than they can invent, so less developed countries can achieve much faster growth than was experienced by today’s industrialized countries when they were becoming wealthy.
危机期间，过度的凯恩斯主义让欧元区债务国得以合法逃脱预算约束，这也导致了资本从德国吸出，而实际上，投资者在试图从南欧撤出。	The excessive Keynesianism used to legitimize indebted eurozone countries’ lack of budgetary constraints during the crisis also caused capital to be sucked out of Germany, when investors actually tried to retreat from southern Europe.
随着人口增长，经济发展和气候变化，干旱、飓风、台风、威力巨大的厄尔尼诺现象、水资源短缺、热浪侵袭、物种灭绝和其他灾难都会愈演愈烈。	With rising populations, economic growth, and climate change, we will face intensifying droughts, hurricanes and typhoons, powerful El Niño’s, water stress, heat waves, species extinctions, and more.
这个世界需要更多的妇女气候领袖，无论是在决策桌旁还是作为企业的掌舵者，承担起推动企业向可持续发展转型的工作。	The world needs more women climate leaders, whether around the tables where policy is made or at the helm of businesses, steering them toward sustainability.
此外，德国核野心可能破坏欧洲微妙的实力平衡 — — 包括（比如）德国和法国之间的平衡 — — 给欧盟的长期团结造成不可估量的后果。	Moreover, a German nuclear ambition might jeopardize the delicate balance of power in Europe – including between Germany and France, for example – with incalculable consequences for the long-term cohesion of the European Union.
即使在情况恶化之前（如果情况确实恶化 ） ， 人们也能察觉出这是“虚假的安慰 ” ， 而不是实言相告。	Even before a situation deteriorates (if it does), people sense when they are being “calmed” rather than informed.
特朗普可能还必须应对来自商业领袖的反对，他们目前基本保持沉默，但可能已经厌倦了特朗普“愤青”气质的推特。	Trump may also have to deal with opposition from business leaders, who have remained largely silent, but could grow tired of his wrathful tweets.
尽管美国现已明确对欧洲的行动表示欢迎，它仍公开对此表示怀疑，迟迟不愿加入，也因此减小了成功的可能性。	While the US has now explicitly welcomed the European initiative, it remains openly skeptical and unwilling to join, thus weakening the chances of success.
正如郭庾信（James Kwak）和我合著的《13位银行家》一书中所说，真正重要的是两党长达几十年的放松管制进程，并以格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案的终结为明确标志。	(As James Kwak and I argued in our book 13 Bankers, what really mattered was the decades-long bipartisan process of deregulation, for which the end of Glass-Steagall was a prominent symbol.)
它向人们宣告不仅科学、技术、工程和数学（合成STEM）教育很有必要，而且私营公司的这项成果在耗费的金钱和时间上只占宇航局预算的一个零头。	The message is not just that STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education is necessary, but also that this achievement by a private company cost just a fraction of NASA's budget in money and time.
在这样阴郁而艰难的大背景下，世界领导人正在这里召开联合国气候变化大会制定新的全球协议实现温室气体减排。	In this subdued and challenging context, world leaders are now convening in the city at the United Nations Climate Change Conference to hammer out a new global agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
而正如金融市场似乎变得平静那样，欧洲领导人再一次燃起了实现重大政策跨越的期望 — — 却也再一次见证了峰会沦在一片争吵中破裂。	Just as financial markets seem to have calmed, European leaders have once again raised expectations of a major policy move – only to see yet another summit devolve into squabbling.
这位乌克兰老牌持异见者、犹太活动家、乌克兰“迈丹 ” （ Maidan）运动的强烈支持者刚刚向华沙群众传递了运动大获全胜、总统给亚努科维奇被推翻的消息。	The veteran Ukrainian dissident, Jewish activist, and passionate advocate of Ukraine’s “Maidan” movement, had just finished briefing a Warsaw audience about the movement’s spectacular victory and President Viktor Yanukovych’s fall from power.
笔者（以及其他各界人士）多年以来都呼吁各国通过发行各类国债的方式来防范风险，并与本国的GDP或者其他类似的经济成就指标挂钩。	I (among others) have been arguing for years that countries should cover their risks by issuing a different kind of national debt, tied to their own GDP or a similar measure of economic success.
照此看，自1979年以来，美国医疗计划的扩张使得合理计量的实际穷人福利增长并不比真实人居GDP慢多少。	On this reading, the expansion of America’s health-care programs has kept the properly measured material wellbeing of its poor on an upward path since 1979 at a rate not much less than that of real per capita GDP.
而与此同时，全球各方也会对以色列加以劝告，要求其准备好迎接该区域的巨变，并借机与巴勒斯坦和叙利亚两方尽快达成和平协议。	Israel, too, would be well advised to prepare for epochal change in the region and try to reach a peace settlement with the Palestinians and Syria as quickly as possible.
事实上，建立欧洲版本的美国证券和交易委员会一直是布鲁塞尔欧洲共同市场行政体系的长期目标 — — 这一目标也许会实现，但不可能是现在。	In fact, establishing a European version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission is a longstanding aim of the Brussels Eurocracy – one that may be achieved one day, but not just yet.
它要求一系列诊断和治疗能力 — — 病理学、手术、放疗、化疗和靶向药物 — — 还需要安全实施这些救命治疗的知识和技能。	It requires a broad range of diagnostic and therapeutic capacities – pathology, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted medicines – together with the knowledge and skill to safely administer these life-saving treatments.
例如，萨尔科奇保证，减少公务员节省下来的钱的一半将会用于提高工资，而涨工资有可能根据业绩才能，这对于工会而言又是一条红线。	For example, Sarkozy has promised that half of the savings from the reduction in public employment will go to higher pay – possibly based on merit, another red line for the trade unions.
但这些参议院听证会是否只是在为监狱里发生的新情况文过饰非，而这些新状况跟原来的情况一样遭 — — 甚至在某种程度上更加恶劣？	But are those Senate hearings actually window dressing on a new reality that is just as bad as the old one – and in some ways worse?
但中国在2005年7月放弃人民币的“传统平衡 ” ， 其实就是在一段时间内排除了一种新的、可靠的固定汇率战略。	But China’s abandonment of the yuan’s “traditional parity” in July 2005 rules out a new, credibly fixed exchange-rate strategy for some time.
美国孩子的出生重量显著较轻（这是日后生活的主要危险信号之一 ） ； 而在11、13和15年龄段超重；十几岁青少年产子率极高。	American children suffer far more from low birth weight (a major danger signal for later life); being overweight at ages 11, 13, and 15; and very high rates of teenage fertility.
发自纽约 — — 无法否认，世界上大多数发达经济体都陷入了所谓长期性停滞的泥潭之中无法自拔：财富不断累积，实际工资却没怎么提升，劳动参与率一直呈下降趋势。	NEW YORK – It has become impossible to deny the so-called secular stagnation gripping the world’s most developed economies: Wealth is piling up, but real wages are barely rising and labor force participation has been on a downward trend.
在乔治·阿科洛夫（George Akerlof）与笔者合著的《动物精神》一书中，我们提出这些转化反映了不断改变的故事内容，新叙事方式的流行，以及互相关联的世界观，而这些都是难以被量化的。	We argue that such shifts reflect changing stories, epidemics of new narratives, and associated views of the world, which are difficult to quantify.
相反，伊拉克境内不同的宗教和种族团体对处死萨达姆的反应体现了将伊拉克作为一个统一的实体团结起来是何等困难。	On the contrary, the way in which the various religious and ethnic groups in Iraq responded to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty of holding Iraq together as a coherent entity.
以德国的标准衡量，当前的财政状况令人不能接受；目前的国债水平也与欧盟的《稳定与增长协定》大相径庭，并成为了未来世代的负担。	The fiscal position is, by German standards, unacceptable, and public debt at current levels is contrary to the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact and a burden on future generations.
在波兰 ， “ 价值观政治”的基础是：建立在宗教基础上的“道德秩序”在堕胎、同性恋权利和死刑等问题上的效力应当超越那种毫无节制的自由主义所代表的自由。	In Poland, the “politics of values” is based on the assumption that a “moral order” based on religion should prevail over the freedoms guaranteed by permissive liberalism on issues such as abortion, gay rights, and the death penalty.
经过一代人的努力，伊朗在伊拉克、黎巴嫩、叙利亚和也门都设立了据点，并在也门协助胡塞叛乱分子破坏穆罕默德·本·萨尔曼对那个国家不合时宜的入侵。	A generation later, Iran has a foothold in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, where it is helping Houthi rebels disrupt MBS’s ill-considered foray into that country.
为了准备好马赫迪的回归，艾哈迈迪内贾德说 ， “ 伊朗应成为一个强大、先进、模范的伊斯兰社会 。 ”	In order to prepare for the Mahdi, Ahmadinejad said, “Iran should turn into a mighty, advanced, and model Islamic society.”
基于规则的多边秩序长期以来一直以来都是基于以下假设：增长和发展自然会让中国向着西方式的经济治理靠拢。	The rules-based multilateral order has long been underpinned by the assumption that growth and development would naturally lead China to embrace Western-style economic governance.
但还有第三种可能：马克龙相信，要推动他所构想的欧盟，他的欧洲政策必须无可指摘，满足最严苛的德国标准。	But there is a third possibility: Macron believes that, to advance his vision for the European Union, he must act impeccably on the European stage, meeting the most stringent German standards.
而令贸易在政治显得尤为突兀的原因是它往往会以一种与其他的主要推动因素 — — 比如科学技术 — — 不同的方式激发人们对不平等现象的观感。	What gives trade particular political salience is that it often raises fairness concerns in ways that the other major contributor to inequality – technology – does not.
另一种方式是停止在收取一定费用后向其他企业发放生产专利所有者药物的强制许可证 — — 上述做法符合TRIPS的规定，但制药行业却拒绝接受。	India could also stop issuing compulsory licenses to allow other companies to produce a patent holder’s drug, in exchange for a fee – an arrangement permitted under TRIPS, but anathema to the drug industry.
在很短的时间内，兄弟和亚马尔这两条输气管道 — — 分别通过乌克兰和波兰连接俄罗斯 — — 几乎肯定会在经济上破产。	Within a very short time, both the Brotherhood and Yamal pipelines – which link Russia with, respectively, Ukraine and Poland – will almost certainly begin to collapse as businesses.
至于Reddit联合创始人亚历克西斯·奥哈尼安（Alexis Ohanian ） ， 他似乎没有因为他的网站所造成的潜在危险而担心多久。	Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, for his part, doesn’t seem to spend much time worrying about the potential dangers posed by his website.
20是八九十年代，美国诸多行业 — — 特别是国内石油行业 — — 面临着这一问题，经济学家迈克尔·延森（Michael Jensen）将这描述为合理处理自由现金流的管理挑战。	In the 1980’s and 1990’s, large swaths of American industry – especially the domestic oil industry – faced this problem, described by the economist Michael Jensen as the managerial challenge of handling free cash flow well.
这个对局在长达两个月的时间里占据着全世界各主要报纸的头版，每一天，都有评论员对对局做出长达五小时的逐步分析。	The match garnered front-page headlines in major newspapers around the world on a daily basis for two months, with commentators providing live move-by-move analysis for up to five hours each day.
但他的总统任期不是耶鲁大学历史学家蒂莫西·斯奈德（Timothy Snyder）和其他人所认为的二十世纪法西斯主义的回放。	But his presidency is not a replay of twentieth-century fascism, as Yale historian Timothy Snyder and others have argued.
我们同时也开始看到特定生产力革命对宏观层面的影响 — — 尤其是在能源和科技部门 — — 而这目前来说主要是工业和某些部门的现象。	We are also starting to see the macro-level impact of certain productivity revolutions – particularly in the energy and technology sectors – that, so far, have mainly been industrial and sectoral phenomena.
与此同时，养老金改革 — — 包括对如何根据通胀调整补助金额的调整 — — 将缓解公共预算的一些压力。	At the same time, pension reform – including adjustments in how benefits are indexed to inflation – will ease some of the pressure on the public budget.
在许多国家确实如此，但在美国兹事体大，让一位偏执的煽动家主政不但将让美国饱受伤害，也会让所有试图在日益危险的世界中捍卫自由的国家受伤。	This is true in many countries, but it matters more in the US, where putting a bigoted demagogue in charge would do great damage not only to that country, but also to all countries trying to hold onto their freedoms in an increasingly perilous world.
实际上，乌克兰财政部长平泽尼克报告说，在2008年的第一季度乌克兰实现预算盈余达到GDP的0.06 % 。	Indeed, Finance Minister Viktor Pynzenyk reports that the state recorded a budget surplus of 0.6% of GDP during the first quarter of 2008.
讽刺之处在于，尽管美国之所以寻求与印度的更强的防务关系，其目的很大程度上是遏制日益专横的中国，但美国总统奥巴马却在中印争端中采取了中立立场。	The irony is that, while America’s pursuit of a stronger defense relationship with India is aimed largely at offsetting an increasingly assertive China, US President Barack Obama has charted a neutral course in Sino-Indian disputes.
迪拜的政治稳定、安全、包容、文化多样性和高水准生活进一步强化了迪拜的品牌形象，吸引了来自世界各国的拥有熟练技术的外籍雇员。	Dubai’s brand is further strengthened by its political stability, safety, tolerance, cultural diversity, and high standard of living, which are a draw for skilled expatriates from around the world.
如今，不论在欧洲，亚洲还是美国，民粹运动者的论调是，精英阶层过于强大，他们主宰者普通民众一切，广大民众的声音被那些自由派人士，多文化主义者和城市精英所淹没。	The tone of populist movements, whether in Europe, Asia, or the US, would suggest that the elites are too powerful, that they dominate the little people, whose voices are drowned out by the liberals, the multiculturalists, and the city slickers.
普林斯（Charles Prince）丢掉花旗集团CEO的工作，是因为在2008年金融危机的酝酿阶段，他的决策过于冒险。 瑞银集团前CEO郭儒博（Oswald Grübel）则由于没能防止规模为23亿美元的无授权交易而被扫地出门。	Chuck Prince lost his job at Citigroup over excessive risk-taking in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, and, more recently, Oswald Grübel of UBS was pushed out for failing to prevent unauthorized trading to the tune of $2.3 billion.
此外，欧元机构的存在能够解决银行或国家所面临的短暂的融资困难。 如此，西班牙深刻的政治危机并未伴随危险的金融市场剧震的原因便也水落石出了。	Add to that the existence of eurozone institutions that can address temporary financing difficulties faced by banks or states, and it becomes clearer why Spain’s deep political crisis has not been accompanied by dangerous financial-market gyrations.
诚然，联合国秘书长潘基文可以发表演讲、召集会议并提出动议，但他所扮演的角色更多的是一位秘书而不是“长 ” 。	True, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon can make speeches, convene meetings, and propose actions, but his role is more secretary than general.
坚持血与土的特权的本土论运动，必然对少数群体不利，特别是犹太人，这导致了促使米勒曾祖父母逃离祖国的暴力。	Nativist movements that insist on the special privileges of blood and soil have invariably been bad for minorities, especially Jews, leading to the kind of violence that drove Miller’s great-grandparents out of their country.
根据欧盟委员会的声明，虽然爱尔兰，法国和意大利进一步紧缩开支，但总体来说，欧元区今年的财政态势将在很大程度上维持中性。	Overall, the eurozone’s fiscal stance is set to be broadly neutral this year, according to the European Commission, albeit with further squeezes in Ireland, France, and Italy.
而为了捍卫自由，这一代价有时会化身为某种置道德于不顾的政治决策，那些无辜的人们则首先沦为这些政治成本的承受者。	But that price can take the form of morally squalid decisions in which innocent people bear the brunt of the cost of freedom’s defense.
但公报也体现出一致同意这一协议的财政部长和央行行长们之间存在深刻的分歧 — — 特别是在货币和财政政策在刺激增长中的作用方面。	But the communiqué also reflects distinct divisions – particularly with regard to the role of monetary and fiscal policy in stimulating growth – among the finance ministers and central bankers who agreed on its text.
不计后果的货币和监管政策把原本简陋的居所变成了自动提款机，让有房一族从泡沫当中提取美元，享受着超出自身经济能力的生活。	Reckless monetary and regulatory policies turned the humble abode into an ATM, allowing families to extract dollars from bubbles and live beyond their means.
唯一貌似有理的通胀方案假定当经济复苏的时候，央行在随之而来的繁荣中不会充分提高利率，从而把当前绝大部分的流动资金留在市场。	The only plausible inflationary scenario presupposes that when economies recover, central banks do not raise interest rates sufficiently in the coming boom, keeping too much of the current liquidity in the market.
德国总理默克尔说减少二氧化碳排放“在经济上是有利的 ” ， 因为“无所作为的经济后果对我们大家都是巨大的 ” 。	Germany’s Angela Merkel says it “makes economic sense” to cut CO2, because the “the economic consequences of inaction will be dramatic for us all.”
Marco Enríquez-Ominami在最新民调中获得了20%的选民支持，这与弗雷非常接近（弗雷的支持率约为26 % ） ，离皮涅拉约38%的支持率差距也不算太大。	Marco Enríquez-Ominami, with about 20% support in recent polls, is remarkably close to Frei (around 26%), and not terribly far from Piñera (roughly 38%).
事实上有一些专家，如经济学家埃德温·杜鲁门（Edwin Truman ） ， 提出了建立一种全球互换机制作为一个更积极有效的危机预防机制 — — 这是一个20国集团应该考虑的方案。	In fact, some experts, such as the economist Edwin Truman, have proposed establishing an institutionalized global swap arrangement as a more effective and robust crisis-prevention mechanism – an idea that G-20 countries should consider.
法德首脑11月中旬在法国多维尔提出倡议修订《里斯本条约 》 ， 把出台强制债务重组机制的时间定在2013年以后，也是为了避免短期内爆发减记潮所可能造成的冲击。	The Franco-German initiative unveiled at Deauville in early November, which would require some possible measure of restructuring for debt issued after 2013, tried to avoid the immediate shock of a haircut.
在其著作《为什么工资不会在衰退中降低 》 （ Why Wages Don’t Fall During a Recession）中，耶鲁大学的勃利（Truman Bewley）报告了大量对负责工资设定和裁员的企业经理的采访。	In his book Why Wages Don’t Fall During a Recession, Truman Bewley of Yale University reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wage-setting and layoffs.
银行、外汇兑换点和ATM门口的长龙见首不见尾 — — 一切人们可以换掉这些即将作废的钞票的地点无不人头攒动。	Long queues snaked in, out, and around banks, foreign-exchange counters, and ATMs – anywhere where people might exchange the soon-to-be-defunct notes.
在加拿大，总理贾斯汀·特鲁多（Justin Trudeau）的政府已经宣布了一项计划以增加公共投资。	In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration has announced a plan to boost public investment.
投资者正在谈论经济复苏的“绿色嫩芽 ” ， 以及正向的“经济行为的第二衍生物 ” （ 持续的经济紧缩是负向的第一衍生物，但其速度的不断减缓表明底部已经临近 ） 。	Investors are talking of “green shoots” of recovery and of positive “second derivatives of economic activity” (continuing economic contraction is the first, negative, derivative, but the slower rate suggests that the bottom is near).
2009年，人们首次找到了露西所在物种吃肉的证据。 研究者发掘了一座埃塞俄比亚遗址，出土了两件339万年历史的化石化的动物骨头，上面有石刀刻上去的标记。	The first evidence that Lucy’s species might have eaten meat came in 2009, when researchers excavating a site in Ethiopia unearthed two 3.39-million-year-old fossilized animal bones scored with markings made with a stone blade.
事先债务重组能降低在改革实施前让债务达到可持续水平所需要的新贷款规模，从而增加吸引投资、增加收入、为复苏打好基础的机会。	An ex ante debt restructuring that reduces the size of any new loans and renders the debt sustainable before any reforms are implemented stands a good chance of crowding in investment, stabilizing incomes, and setting the stage for recovery.
比如，Hospitality Properties Trust公司的独立董事甘斯（Bruce Gans）由于只获得了43%的股东的支持而选择辞职。	For example, after receiving only 43% of shareholders’ support, Bruce Gans, an independent director of Hospitality Properties Trust, resigned.
只要美国能重新检讨对台军售或者撤回对日本钓鱼岛/尖阁列岛主权诉求的支持，那么中国就不会在阿富汗撤军行动上做手脚。	China might agree not to undermine America as it withdraws only if the US agrees to rethink its arms sales to Taiwan, or to pull back from its commitment to support Japan’s claims to the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, the ownership of which China disputes.
他做得更糟：从根本上选择了错误的方向¾这样的错误在九一一事件之前就已经存在，那次给人们留下巨大创伤的事件并不是美国在全世界扮演摩尼教徒的开始，而只是又一次强化了这种已经存在的趋势。	He did worse: he simply took a wrong turn – and he took it before 9/11, a traumatic event that reinforced, but did not create, America’s Manichean view of itself and its role in the world.
中国那些低薪水要求但生产力更高的制造业工人以及高质量的基础设施（公路，电力，港口和通信设施）已经为全球竞争设定了新的标杆。	China’s low-paid, reasonably productive manufacturing workers and high-quality infrastructure (roads, power, ports, and communications) has set the standard for competitiveness globally.
但加强EASO并提高金融支持应该有助于缓解目前的紧张局面，至少能够让欧洲庇护体系制定彻底的改革计划。	But strengthening EASO and boosting financial support should go some way toward alleviating today’s tensions, at least until a radical reform of Europe’s asylum system can be contemplated.
与其他公司一样，金融机构也要缴纳所得税，其中费用（包括企业的融资成本，如对债权人的利息支付）可以从收入中扣除。	Like other corporations, financial institutions are taxed on their income, with expenses – including the firm’s financing costs, like interest payments to its creditors – deducted from revenues.
现在，我们应该已经领教，在表面上比特朗普信誉高得多的政府领导下的美国也照样会犯各种可怕的错误，比如发动越南和伊拉克战争。	We should have learned by now that the US, under administrations with far more prima facie credibility than Trump’s, is perfectly capable of making terrible mistakes, such as the wars in Vietnam and Iraq.
其实，尽管很难界定发射在多大程度上影响了日本的选举，自民党（我本人是自民党党员，并担任竞选活动副主席）获得压倒性胜利却是不争的事实。	Indeed, although it is difficult to say how large an impact the launch had on the result in Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party (of which I am a member, serving as Deputy Chair of the election campaign) won a landslide victory.
但最终，特朗普的非典型 — — 并且越来越可恶 — — 执政才是更大的全球威胁，他给了普京更多地机会，冒险激进地削弱美国的实力。	Ultimately, however, it is Trump’s aberrant – and increasingly abhorrent – presidency that poses the bigger global threat, not least by offering Putin more opportunities to engage in adventurism and degrade US power.
不仅如此，这些虔诚的崇拜者还用美国资金充足、竞争激烈的大学体系来证明自己的正确，这些大学吸纳世界顶尖学生和研究人员的数量之多令人惊讶。	Moreover, the true believers cite America’s better-funded and hyper-competitive university system, which sucks in a disproportionate share of the world’s top students and researchers.
但奥巴马建议卢拉利用两国之间的商务关系告诉伊朗领导人，要求他效仿巴西的范例（禁止将核能用于军事目的的禁令已经载入巴西宪法 ） 。	But Obama suggested using the weight of commercial relations between the two countries to tell the Iranian leader that he should follow Brazil’s example (in Brazil, the ban on nuclear energy for military purposes is enshrined in the Constitution).
首先，银行是主要债权人，任何重组都会给它们带来巨大的损失，必然会造成多米诺效应，悲观情绪的蔓延将导致利率升高、毁掉其他借款人的光明前景。	First, banks were the primary creditors, and the large losses that they would face in any restructuring was bound to trigger a domino effect, with waves of pessimism driving up interest rates and ruining other borrowers’ prospects.
与欧洲议会共同构成欧盟立法机构的欧洲部长理事会就像朝鲜一样充满秘密；事实上，上述委员会一贯闭门造车，从未留下任何的公共发言记录。	The Council of Ministers – which, together with the European Parliament, makes up the EU’s legislature – is as impenetrably secretive as that of North Korea; indeed, it operates behind closed doors, without any public record of who said what.
黎巴嫩有一百多万难民，是全世界人均对应难民数最多的国家 — — 相当于德国人和法国人全部移民到美国。	Lebanon has more than one million, the world’s highest refugee population per capita – equivalent to the combined populations of Germany and France migrating to the US.
毕竟，全球巨型银行的产生并不是市场结果；这些银行是受政府赞助和补贴的单位，它们的繁荣是站在纳税人的肩膀上的。	After all, the emergence of global megabanks was not a market outcome; these banks are government-sponsored and subsidized enterprises, propped up by taxpayers.
该帖子的作者凯迪·法兰特（Katie Farrant）和玛格达·鲁特科夫斯卡（Magda Rutkowska）认为，公司行为可能因为金融危机而已经发生了改变，难以获得银行融资导致他们永久性增加想现金缓冲。	The authors, Katie Farrant and Magda Rutkowska, suggest that corporate behavior may have changed as a result of the financial crisis, as difficulties in accessing bank financing led them to increase their cash buffers permanently.
随着这些改革措施的推进，印度企业最终应能够恢复支出，银行也将再次能够给至关重要但目前负债沉重的基础设施和制造业部门提供贷款。	As these reforms take hold, Indian firms should finally be able to resume spending, and banks will once again be able to lend to the critical but currently indebted infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.
吸引顶尖评级的企业可以获得卓越的增长，新客户因为优异的总体评价慕名而来，并在光临后给出更加（积极）的反馈。	Businesses that attract top ratings can enjoy exponential growth, as new customers are attracted by good overall reviews and subsequently provide yet more (positive) feedback.
但当地官员显然是无法安排嘎玛桑珠到遥远的新疆受审的，更别说去说服中央政府查禁那本没有政治问题，描述几兄弟对自然之爱的书。	But local officials could not have arranged for Karma to be tried in far-away Xinjiang, let alone persuade the central government to ban the brothers’ innocuous book about their love of nature.
库尔德人民拥有合法的政府，也并未参与谋杀、袭击清真寺和对在校学生的自杀性爆炸活动，他们凭什么受到惩罚？	Why should the one region - and people - who run an orderly government, are not involved in murder, attacks on mosques, and suicide bombing of schoolchildren, be penalized?
法国总理瓦尔斯称玛丽安妮·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）的极右翼政党国民阵线（ National Front）的胜利是一场政治“地震 ” 。	French Prime Minister Manuel Valls described the victory of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Front as a political “earthquake.”
肯尼迪言简意赅地给出了对问题的判断 ： “ 我们都陷入到危险的恶性循环之中，一方的怀疑引起对方的怀疑，新武器很快招来反制武装 。 ”	Kennedy diagnosed the problem succinctly: “We are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on one side breeds suspicion on the other, and new weapons beget counter-weapons.”
但他们不可能没有注意到自己所支持的进程也损害了他们自身的利益—令财富的差距更为明显，并使实际的全球（财富）分配的公平性更值得怀疑。	But they cannot fail to notice that the processes they support undercut their own position by rendering the wealth gap more obvious and the fairness of the actual global distribution more questionable.
在英国，一项Opinium公司的调查显示多数选民认为环境税的主要目的是聚敛钱财，而不是保护环境，而10个受调查者中有7个不愿为应对气候变化缴纳更多赋税。	In the UK, an Opinium survey shows that most voters think green taxes are mainly for raising cash rather than the environment, and 7 out of 10 are not willing to pay more in taxes to combat climate change.
在经历了多年的长期高结构性失业后，从2003年开始，德国实施了一系列劳动力市场和其他改革，其经济也成为欧盟表现最好的经济之一。	After years of high and long-term structural unemployment, the country implemented a series of labor-market and other reforms beginning in 2003, turning its economy into one of the top performers in the EU.
印度正面对增长显著放缓，大量财政和经常帐户赤字，劳动力市场僵化，以及5月大选结束后的经济政策不确定状况。	India is suffering from a marked growth slowdown, substantial fiscal and current-account deficits, labor-market rigidities, and uncertainty about economic policy until after its month-long general election ends in May.
但果真如此的话，我们还必须假设，在某种程度上，他本人已经失衡，从对西方的某种游击战 — — 永远存在撤退的可能 — — 转变为孤注一掷的战争。	But to say that, one must also assume that to some extent he himself is unbalanced and has shifted from a kind of guerilla warfare against the West, always with some possibility of retreat, to all-out combat.
为了进一步保护地方经济，大风暴过后应该用“人工育滩 ” （ 用外部资源补充损失的沙子）对海滩进行修复。	In order to protect the local economy further, beaches should be repaired after major storms through “beach nourishment” (replacement of lost sand from external sources).
改革派经济学家说刺激计划已经成功阻止了更深的衰退（情况甚至可能更糟 ） ， 但是这些措施太束手束脚，无法带来强劲的复苏。	The progressive economist says that stimulus worked, staving off a much deeper recession – if not worse – but that the measures were too timid to generate a robust recovery.
第三版诊断手册混淆正常的剧烈悲痛和延续至今的抑郁症精神疾病，这种情况是在精神医生应对 20 世纪 70 年代出现的职业挑战时无意中造成的。	The DSM-III’s confusion of normal intense sadness and depressive mental disorder, which persists to the present, emerged inadvertently from psychiatry’s response to challenges to the profession during the 1970’s.
随着世界石油产能接近极限，油价已经比伊拉克战争之前涨了一倍多。 而这样的政策预示着更高的油价，和石油工业的更高利润—该行业是布什中东政策中唯一清楚的赢家。	With world oil production close to full capacity and prices already more than double their pre-Iraq War level, this portends still higher prices, and still higher profits for the oil industry – the only clear winner in Bush’s Middle East policy.
他不仅达成协议邀请朝鲜参与在平昌举行的冬奥会，他还说服美国总统唐纳德·特朗普其实这符合特朗普的想法。	Not only did he broker an agreement to bring North Korea to the Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang; he also convinced US President Donald Trump that doing so was in fact Trump’s idea.
康克由，通常人称“杜赫 ” ， 在其主持下有14 000人在S-21监狱死去。 该监狱是由金边的一所高中所改建的刑讯中心。	Kaing Guek Eav, commonly known as “Duch,” presided over the deaths of more than 14,000 people at S-21, a former Phnom Penh high school turned into a torture center.
比如，约翰霍普金斯布隆伯格公共卫生学院（Bloomberg School of Public Health）疟疾研究所的研究人员发现了如何在蚊子中间传播疟原虫抗性。	For example, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Malaria Research Institute have discovered how resistance to the malaria parasite can spread in a mosquito population.
此外，非盟/经合组织报告《非洲发展动态2018 》 （ Africa’s Development Dynamics 2018）强调，如果失业趋势继续，非洲年轻人将受到最大冲击。	Furthermore, the African Union/OECD report Africa’s Development Dynamics 2018 highlights that if the underemployment trend continues, Africa’s young people will suffer the most.
难道抵制、撤资和制裁运动“只”针对被占领土、那里修建的犹太定居点和定居人口所制产品就应该被心安理得地忽视？	Is this just a detail that can be safely ignored on the grounds that BDS targets “only” the territories, the Jewish settlements being built there, and the goods that the settlers produce?
在习近平取消主席任期制时，大家都认为他在中共党内的统治地位几乎是无可置疑的，因此他的权威也不可能受到挑战。	At the time of Xi’s announcement, the conventional wisdom was that his dominance inside the Chinese party-state was virtually absolute, and thus that his authority could not possibly come under attack.
当然这里所指的马克思主义不是东德的僵化马克思主义，而是新的“及其重要的”被赫伯特·马尔库塞这些人所信仰的马克思主义。	Not the fossilized Marxism of the German Democratic Republic, of course, but the new “critical” Marxism espoused by figures such as Herbert Marcuse.
随后，美国与加拿大、墨西哥、智利、哥伦比亚、秘鲁和中美洲签订了贸易协定，但雄心勃勃、亘穿南北美洲的贸易协定最终未能实现。	The US subsequently signed agreements with Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Central America, but the ambitious and overarching north-south agreement did not materialize.
在明治維新时期，日本广泛搜寻各种工具和革新方法，逐渐发展为一个主要的权力国，而不是西方帝国主义的牺牲品。	During the Meiji Restoration, Japan searched broadly for tools and innovations that would allow it to become a major power rather than a victim of Western imperialism.
波罗的海诸国爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚、立陶宛率先坚持走自己的国家路线，并加入了欧盟和北约，从此将他们的命运与欧洲联系起来。	The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were the first to insist on traveling their own national path, and have since linked their fate to Europe as members of the European Union and NATO.
王室相信，伊斯兰教圣地守护者的地位将让他们在阿拉伯世界中占据独一无二的地位，没有哪个革命能动摇他们。	The royals believe that custodianship of Islam’s holy places gives them a special status in the Arab world, and that no revolution can touch them.
若在对卡扎菲的战争罪行所作的审判不能取得进展，NTC的指控将不会对他产生任何威胁，这也说明NTC无力处理刑事案件。	With no progress toward trying Qaddafi for war crimes, the NTC is holding him on the innocuous charge of failure to possess a camel license.
面对历史上最大的考验，欧元远远没有如诺贝尔奖得主经济学家米尔顿·弗里德曼10年前所预测的那样进入灾难性的阶段。	Faced with the biggest test in its history, the euro is far from steering into disaster, as the Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman predicted ten years ago.
尤其是华盛顿共识 — — 影响IMF、世界银行、美国和英国政策的自由市场原则 — — 制造了大量不满，特别是在20世纪90年代亚洲金融危机后。	In particular, the Washington Consensus – the set of free-market principles that influences the policies of the IMF, the World Bank, the US, and the UK – has generated considerable resentment, especially after the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s.
新的可持续发展目标应明确与环境问题挂钩；毕竟不清楚农业、水利和极端天气之间的复杂关系就不能消除饥饿。	The new Sustainable Development Goals should be explicitly linked to environmental issues; after all, hunger cannot be eliminated without taking into account the complex interaction between agriculture, water, and extreme weather.
它们至少涉及五个物种，而且采取危险的排列方式：细菌本身、土拨鼠或沙鼠等储存宿主、跳蚤媒介、与人类近距离接触的啮齿类动物以及人类受害者本身。	They involved a minimum of five species, in perilous alignment: the bacterium itself, the reservoir host such as marmots or gerbils, the flea vector, the rodent species in close quarters with humans, and the human victims.
1976年计划呼吁可持续发展地伐木以及森林火灾的基本控制，但是战争爆发使阿富汗失去了一半的森林土地。	The 1976 plan called for sustainable logging and basic forest-fire control, but war intervened, costing Afghanistan half its forest cover.
在这些领域的研究有时会遭遇激烈的反对。 例如在干细胞研究领域遇到的宗教阻力，或由于对改变人类身份的可能性的恐惧而引发的阻力。	Research in these areas sometimes meets with vehement rejection, for example, on religious grounds with respect to stem-cell research, or owing to fear with respect to the possibility of altering human identity.
在这些努力的影响下，最2002年以来，土耳其非正式就业下降了14.5个百分点至2013年4月的37.6 % 。	As a result of these efforts, informal employment in Turkey has declined by 14.5 percentage points since 2002, to 37.6% in April 2013.
埃及并没有煽动以色列和哈马斯在加沙地带的交火升级，相反却与美国和其他区域盟国合作敦促双方签订停火协议。	Rather than inciting an escalation in fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Egypt worked with the US and other regional allies to broker a cease-fire.
因此，中国有责任发展出一套能够真正实现经济和社会结构有效变化，同时又确保政府有效问责，的国家治理体系。	It thus has a responsibility to develop a system of governance that can deliver structural changes to its economy and society, while ensuring effective accountability.
当我告诉他们我根本不知道与乌兹别克斯坦伊斯兰运动有关的任何事情的时候，他们警告我说，一旦我落到了他们的手中，他们就会让我合作的。	When I told them that I didn’t know anything about this group, they warned that once I was back in their custody, they would make me cooperate.
但认为中国经济和政治发展岌岌可危的观点往往忽视了中国改革的“适应性学习过程”这一重要特征 — — 这一过程烙印于每一项经济、外交、军事和社会政策上。	And yet the claim that China’s economic and political development is in jeopardy seems to ignore the country’s adaptive learning process, which shapes every economic, diplomatic, military, and social policy.
斯德哥尔摩—北欧国家的经济表现不错，其中很重要的原因之一就是它们在逐步改革自己的“社会模式 ” ， 响应人民的需求来应对新的现实情况。	STOCKHOLM – The Nordic countries’ economies are performing well, and a part of the reason is that they are gradually reforming their “social model,” adapting it to new realities in ways that respond to people’s demands.
但急于创造就业岗位的特朗普内阁已经取消了奥巴马时代的限制政策，宣布将向巴林出售价值50亿美元的战斗机。	But the Trump administration, eager to generate manufacturing jobs, has lifted Obama-era restrictions, announcing that it will sell $5 billion worth of fighter jets to Bahrain.
比如，一位面临生态或核灾难的领导人，很有可能因此而降低对国内社会问题的关注，但有效的全球合作依赖强大的个体国家。	For example, while it would be tempting for a leader confronting ecological or nuclear disaster to devote less attention to domestic social issues, effective global cooperation depends on strong individual states.
当今收入不平等的决定性因素是财富不平等。 近几年愈演愈烈的产权集中化是造成大多数国家更严重收入不平等的首要因素。	The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality, with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries.
因此，在引入新的治国风格时 — — 比如根据能力任命内阁成员 — — 佐科维必须小心从事，避免得罪长期从把持权力中获益的政治和商界精英。	So, in introducing a new style of governance, exemplified by merit-based cabinet appointments, Jokowi must be careful not to alienate the political and business elites who have long benefited from their tight grip on power.
国家间出于自身利益进行合作，但一个国家的军事实力，还有它具备的软性或吸引力量，能对合作力度产生深远的影响。	Countries cooperate out of self-interest, but a country's soft or attractive power, not only its military might, affects the degree of cooperation.
但所有人 — — 从联合国秘书长潘基文到政府机构、公司董事会和社会团体 — — 都在谈论如何建立和保持恢复力。	Yet everyone – from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to government agencies, company boards, and community groups – is talking about how to build or maintain it.
如果我们还没有吸取这样的教训，那么这件事的教训之一就是告诉我们尽管选出了一位黑人总统，但种族敏感问题多么容易在美国生活中浮出水面。	One thing to be learned, if we didn’t know this already, is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life, despite the election of a black president.
2006年的三峡大坝（世界最大大坝）建成后的一系列严重环境后果让中国放慢了建坝计划，如今，中国急切地开始建设新一代大坝。	After slowing its dam-building program in response to the serious environmental consequences of completion in 2006 of the Three Gorges Dam – the world’s largest – China is now rushing to build a new generation of giant dams.
一项瑞典的研究表明，素食可以便宜10 % ， 释放出大约2%的个人总预算。 这笔额外的支出会导致更多的二氧化碳排放，该研究认为其效果相当于让因吃素而实现的减排量减少一半。	A Swedish study shows a vegetarian diet is 10% cheaper, freeing up about 2% of an individual’s total budget.That extra spending will cause more CO2 emissions, which the study concludes will cancel out half the saved emissions from going vegetarian.
韩国半导体和石化产品出口连续第六个月实现正增长，四月份的出口总额比去年同期高出24 % ， 主要股价指数都已经回升至历史新高。	In April, total exports were 24% higher than a year earlier. The main stock price index has returned to its all-time high.
巴勒斯坦人在以色列工作对双方都有好处，也比来自遥远国家并在以色列过着孤立的生活的外国人好，这些外国人很孤独并且经常处于被开除的威胁之下。	Palestinians working in Israel are good for both sides, and better than the foreigners who come from distant lands and live an isolated life in Israel, solitary and under constant threat of expulsion.
毫不奇怪，投资者对两家公司的新战略计划相当欢迎，对EDF退出美国市场的决定亦然，两家公司股价下跌的压力有所缓解，但会维持多久还有待观察。	Not surprisingly, investors have welcomed new strategic plans by both companies, as well as EDF’s withdrawal from the US market; the downward pressure on their share prices has eased, though for how long remains to be seen.
这些流入中的大头进入了建筑和服务业 — — 它们也是GDP增长的主要引擎 — — 其目的是为了满足国际民用和军用需求。	Most of these inflows were directed toward the construction and services sectors – the main drivers of GDP growth – and aimed to satisfy international demand, both civilian and military.
但是，就如同我在本人的新书《赌场-资本》中指出的，这些现象只是境况暂时好转，而并非全面复苏。 因为银行资产负债表上的隐形亏损可能很大。	But, as I point out in my new book Kasino-Kapitalismus , this may only be a temporary improvement in expectations rather than a sign of permanent recovery, as the size of the banks’ hidden losses on their balance sheets is probably enormous.
而在被问到这个科学家小组的成就的重要性的时候，研究资助人温特则认为此举“为我们的生命观带来了重大的哲学意义上的变革 。 ”	Asked about the significance of what the team had done, Venter described it as bringing about “a giant philosophical change in how we view life.”
在过去几个月中，特朗普承诺的增加政府支出、降低企业税收、削减监管约束等新政吸引了全球避险投资流向美国寻求高质量资产，导致美元猛烈升值。	The dollar’s value has risen particularly high in the last few months, as Trump’s promises to increase government spending, lower business taxes, and cut regulation have inspired a flight to quality by investors.
顾问们借以打造发展战略的经济模型 — — 该模式得到说客的吹捧以影响重大基础设施项目决策 — — 根本没有考虑空气污染造成的人员成本，也没有考虑减排措施带来的长期好处。	Economic models used by advisers to shape development strategy – and touted by lobbyists to influence decisions on major infrastructure projects – exclude the human cost of air pollution and the long-term benefits of measures to reduce it.
除了改善黎巴嫩公共教育体系的管理和质量外，我还要决定如何处理前所未有的叙利亚难民潮 — — 其中大约有五十万人是儿童。	In addition to improving the management and quality of Lebanon’s public education system, I had to determine how to handle the unprecedented influx of refugees from Syria – around half a million of them children.
如今，全世界近1,500万人能获得艾滋病治疗，帮助他们继续成为有生产力的社会成员，而在2000年MDG启动时，这一数字只有10,000人。	Today nearly 15 million people worldwide receive treatment for AIDS, helping them continue to be productive members of society, compared to only about 10,000 people in 2000, when the MDGs were launched.
她希望英国制定自己的关税和其他世贸组织贸易承诺，然后独立地与一些国家谈判优惠安排 — — 并冠之以误导性的称呼“自由贸易协定 ” 。	She wants Britain to set its own tariffs and other trade commitments at the World Trade Organization, and then independently negotiate preferential arrangements – misleadingly called “free-trade agreements” – with some countries.
如今，他们正越来越多地采取措施取消补贴、引入市场价和提高效率 — — 这些都是与能源进口国相关的典型政策。	Today, they are increasingly taking steps to remove subsidies, introduce market prices, and increase efficiency – policies that are more typically associated with energy-importing countries.
那时意大利和西班牙就能以接近于欧洲央行存款利率的收益率为其债务重新融资了。 目前强制性存款的利率为1 % ， 非强制性存款的利率要高25个基点。	Italy and Spain would then be able to refinance their debt at close to the ECB’s deposit rate, which is currently 1% on mandatory reserves and 25 basis points on excess-reserve accounts.
这种集体惩罚的一个例子发生在2014年的乌干达，因为乌干达政府实施了同性恋入罪的立法，世界银行冻结了约9,000万美元贷款。	An example of such collective punishment occurred in Uganda in 2014, when the World Bank froze some $90 million in loans following the government’s enactment of legislation criminalizing homosexuality.
欧盟国家有两个选择：它们可以徒劳地试图恢复过时的单一民族国家；也可以带着民族文化不但能存活下来、还能繁荣昌盛的认识接受多元化。	The countries of the EU have two options: They can either make a vain attempt to revert to outdated, mono-ethnic models of statehood, or they can accept diversity with the realization that their national cultures will not only survive, but flourish.
总体算来，发展中国家的增长率达到了每年7 % ， 发达经济体也有2%的年增长率，核算起来全球年增长约有4.5 % 。	Overall, the developing countries are growing at around 7% per year, and the developed economies at around 2%, yielding a global average of around 4.5%.
它们必须愿意承担实施风险，因为它们认为作为欧盟成员国（或者它们本身作为政治行动国 ） ， 它们可以实现好处。	They must be willing to bear the costs of implementation because they believe that the benefits to their countries as EU members (or to themselves as political actors) will be realized.
把他击垮的打击是校方取消了他的助学金，而这不仅是他学业经济来源，还支持着他的单身母亲。 而取消助学金是对他积极参与政治活动的惩罚。	The ultimate indignity was the withholding of a fellowship on which he depended to support not only himself, but also his single mother – a punishment for his political activism.
事实上，这一方针 — — 它有可能导致给相关经济体带来无穷好处的协定流产 — — 建立在一个谬误的基础上。	In fact, such an approach – which has the potential to derail agreements that would bring considerable benefits to the economies involved – is based on a fallacy.
如果我们接受以上西方作为一种心态的定义就会带来三个大问题。 它们是：东方在不被西化的情况下能否现代化？	If we accept the above definition of the West as a mindset, this leaves open three major questions: can the East be modernized without being Westernized?
由副总统切尼领导的布什政府（切尼获得了老板布什的明确授意）不久前指责俄国退回到了旧式的“邪恶帝国”时代。	The Bush administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney (but with his boss’s explicit approval), recently accused Russia of backsliding into its old “evil empire” ways.
上述团体无法理解内塔尼亚胡，无法理解他为什么像传统的阿拉伯领袖那样公开要求犹太权利、捍卫国家利益、不断做出和解暗示却几乎不做任何实质性的让步。	These groups do not understand Netanyahu, who proclaims Jewish rights, defends his country’s interests, and hints at conciliation but gives up little – much like a traditional Arab leader.
而她的政府要求债务国通过极端紧缩和痛苦的调整来应对金融恐慌，哪怕与此同时德国的经常账户盈余是不断膨胀的。	And her governments responded to financial panic by demanding extreme austerity and painful adjustments in debtor countries, even as Germany’s current-account surplus swelled.
1937年另一个一夜风靡的词汇是“消费不足论 ” （ underconsumption ） 。 该理论认为，恐慌的人们会为过多储蓄以应对未来艰难时世。	The other term that suddenly became prominent around 1937 was “underconsumptionism” – the theory that fearful people may want to save too much for difficult times ahead.
就连外交政策也尽可能与崛起的中产阶级经济利益保持一致（虽然叙利亚干预行动反映外交政策重点发生了变化 ） 。	Even foreign policy was, wherever possible, aligned with the economic interests of the rising middle class (though the Syrian intervention reflects a shift in foreign-policy priorities).
以去年春在华盛顿特区的布鲁金斯学会上发表的一篇论文为例，其作者哈佛大学教授詹姆斯·斯托克（James Stock）和普林斯顿大学教授马克·沃森（Mark Watson）公布了一个新的“动力因素模型 ” ， 采用了1959到2011年的数据进行估算。	For example, in a paper presented last spring at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, James Stock of Harvard University and Mark Watson of Princeton University unveiled a new “dynamic factor model,” estimated using data from 1959 to 2011.
在运用一个策略的时候，由于相信阿拉伯国家对它们事业团结一致的空洞的宣言，巴勒斯坦领导人没能准确的判断他们在面对以色列时的实力。	With each approach, Palestinian leaders, believing Arab states’ hollow proclamations of solidarity with their cause, have failed to measure accurately their own powers vis-à-vis the Israelis.
所幸的是，最终，反对国家被迫与一个比它们自己的更为强烈的意志斗争，也就是，在废除了奴隶制和酷刑后，想要在文明的道路上做出另一个转折点的人们的意志。	Fortunately, in the end, the opponents were forced to fight a will stronger than their own: the will of those who – after the abolition of slavery and torture – want to mark another turning point for civilization.
20世纪90年代末，国企上市获得了双赢的效果，既确保了解决历史遗留的亏损的新资源，又推进了治理水平和生产率的提高。	In the late 1990s, public listings of SOEs had the twin benefits of securing new resources for tackling legacy losses and propelling governance and productivity gains.
在任职联合国秘书长期间，上个月刚刚去世的安南常常希望了解为什么拥有大量肥沃土地和丰沛淡水资源的非洲大陆未能将农业耕作转变为一种资产。	During his tenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations, Annan, who died last month, often wondered why so much of Africa – with its abundance of fertile land and freshwater – had failed to turn farming into an asset.
如果希腊想要拥有以先进技术为基础的二十一世纪经济繁荣，就必须为此付出努力，像德国一样制造世界市场上颇具竞争力的创新产品。	If Greece wants the prosperity associated with a technologically advanced, twenty-first-century economy, it will have to earn it, by producing innovative products that are competitive on world markets, just as Germany does.
美国唯一一家测试服务提供商 迈里德遗传学公司拒绝接受她的保险，而 切里亚尼则因此无法承担测试开销。 迈里德遗传学公司不仅拥有诊断测试专利，而且掌握着 基因本身 的专利所有权。	Myriad Genetics, the sole test provider in the US – it holds a patent on the genes themselves , not just on the diagnostic test – did not accept her insurance, and Ceriani could not afford to pay for the test.
但现在，特朗普正在征召寡头和前军人进入其内阁，我们有理由质疑他是否会履行自己摆脱华盛顿“建制派”进行治理的承诺。	But now that Trump is filling his cabinet with oligarchs and former military men, we have reason to doubt that he will keep his promise to govern without the Washington “establishment.”
随着中央集权的进一步扩大，俄罗斯的主权财富基金正在濒临枯竭。 如果一直这么下去的话，俄罗斯的外汇储备最终也会消耗殆尽。	A variety of acronyms has been suggested, from the cutesy BRICET (adding Eastern Europe and Turkey) to BRICKETs (the former plus South Korea) and – an even greater stretch – BRIMC, which shoehorns Mexico into the mix.
但随着基础设施投资促进经济增长，由此增加的税收有可能提供长期资金，地方政府利用土地和本币债券市场的能力也将随之提高。	But, as these investments bolster economic growth, increased tax revenues would imply more sustainable financing, as would local governments’ ability to leverage land markets and approach local-currency debt markets.
在医疗领域，这意味着利用联邦医疗保险和联邦医疗补助的购买力、社会企业家和慈善机构的风险承担力和市场和私人企业的活力。	In health care, that means taking advantage of the purchasing clout of Medicare and Medicaid, the risk-taking of social entrepreneurs and philanthropists, and the dynamism of markets and private business.
现在它国将发现，美国妄为独行或退出国际舞台这两种选择之外，另一种可行的方法是真正的多边主义，这就要求他们有意愿和能力承诺资源来处理紧急的挑战。	Now others will find that the alternative to America going it alone or withdrawing from the global scene is real multilateralism, which requires their willingness and ability to commit resources to deal with pressing challenges.
比如，在2015年9月的前一百名经济学家中，只有14人在2006年时没有跻身范围广得多的顶尖5 % ， 另只有两人在上一个十年中排名进步了200名以上。	For example, of the top 100 economists in September 2015, only 14 were absent from the much wider top 5% in 2006, and only two others had advanced more than 200 spots over the previous decade.
可持续商业模式还能在2030年前创造多达3.8亿个重要经济部门就业岗位，包括食品和农业、能源、交通、医疗和市政等。	Such models can also create up to 380 million jobs by 2030 in key economic sectors, including food and agriculture, energy, transport, health, and municipal government.
现代经济学和金融学理论大体上基于人类理性的假设 — — 人类总是系统性地最大化自身的快乐程度，即经济学家所谓的“效用 ” 。	Much of modern economic and financial theory is based on the assumption that people are rational, and thus that they systematically maximize their own happiness, or as economists call it, their “utility.”
对叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德政权的坚定支持者伊朗来说，美国-沙特关系的削弱是改变地区实力平衡的关键 — — 特别是伴随着西方经济制裁放松的话。	For Iran, a staunch supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, a weaker US-Saudi relationship is key to shifting the regional balance of power – especially if it is accompanied by the easing of Western economic sanctions.
市场上在很久以前就已难觅希腊、爱尔兰和葡萄牙发行的债务的买家了，很快，意大利和西班牙债也将无人问津（或者要求极高的利率 ） 。	Markets long ago stopped buying bonds issued by Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, and might soon stop buying paper issued by Italy and Spain – or do so only at prohibitive interest rates.
最后但也同样重要的一点在于，鉴于引进外国技术向来不易且在未来日益艰难，中国肯定会在自主创新方面做出更大的努力以减少这方面的依赖度。	Last but not least, China certainly will make a bigger effort in indigenous innovation and creation to reduce its dependence on foreign technology, which has never been easy to obtain and will be increasingly difficult to secure.
一如它在苏菲派神殿事件上所做的声明那样，该组织否认参与对美国领事馆的袭击，并强调引发此次袭击的主要是侮辱先知的行为。	Like its statement on the destruction of Sufi shrines, it denied involvement in the attack on the US Consulate, but stressed the gravity of the insult against the Prophet that putatively triggered it.
然而吉斯卡尔1981年的连任失利在很大程度上要归因于其前总理雅克·希拉克的“背叛 ” ， 最终被后者取而代之。	In 1981, Giscard was defeated largely as a result of the “betrayal” of his former prime minister, Jacques Chirac, who ran against him.
但俄罗斯并没有止步于克里米亚；从那以后，它在乌克兰东部的顿巴斯地区对乌克兰发动了一场低烈度的非常规战争。	But Russia didn’t stop with Crimea; since then, it has waged a low-intensity unconventional war against Ukraine in the country’s eastern Donbas region.
事实上，I期试验 — — 也称为“I期人体试验 ” — —既危险又在道德上非常棘手，这意味着必须秉承极度的小心谨慎行事。	Indeed, phase I trials – also called “first-in-man studies” – are extremely risky and ethically knotty, meaning that they must be handled with the utmost care.
在中国认识到它从一个合法的缅甸政府那里获得的利益要比从一个无能的军事政权那里获得的更多之前，什么都不会发生。	Until China decides that it has more to gain from a more legitimate government in Burma than it does from the current incompetent military regime, little can happen.
该方法不需要计量经济学家用集中化方法做研究然后向所有人公布实验结果，而是让教师以分散地方方式做研究，向中心报告他们的发现。	Instead of having an econometrician do the learning in a centralized manner and inform everybody about the results of the experiment, it is the teachers who are doing the learning in a decentralized manner and informing the center of what they found.
达卡—我们人类不但与其他各物种 — — 包括动物、植物乃至微生物 — — 分享地球；我们还需仰仗他们生存。	DHAKA – We humans do not only share the planet with a range of other species, including plants, animals, and even microbes; we also depend on them for our survival.
上个月，30多个国家 — — 包括欧元区成员国、加蓬、墨西哥、挪威、俄罗斯、瑞士和美国 — — 递交了2020年后温室气体减排计划。	Last month, more than 30 countries – including the European Union’s members, Gabon, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, and the United States – submitted their post-2020 plans to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
但尽管习近平目前有能力去应对日益复杂和敌对的外部经济环境，其国内依然存在着许多即将爆发的严重内部问题。	But while Xi has thus far managed to deal with an increasingly complex and hostile external economic environment, many serious internal concerns could easily erupt into bigger problems.
2015年，习近平的左右手、反腐运动主帅王岐山在一份文件中提出了中共“合法性”的问题。 这在此前一直是一个禁忌。	In 2015, Wang Qishan, Xi’s right-hand man who has been leading the anticorruption campaign, raised the question of the CCP’s “legitimacy” in a statement that previously would have been taboo.
在最近闭幕的第十一届全国人民代表大会上，讨论中听到最多的词是“幸福 ” ， 而不是以往官方词汇中的最常用的“经济发展 ” 。	At the recently concluded 11th People’s National Congress, the word heard most often in policy discussions was “happiness,” which had suddenly replaced “economic growth” as the official mantra.
全然不顾纳税人所遭受的风险，金融机构们利用拯救计划来恢复它们的赢利性，而它们损人利己的老习惯又开始死灰复燃。	Dismissing the risks that taxpayers incurred, financial institutions used the bailout to restore profitability and are now reverting to their old habits, which had worked so well for them and so badly for others.
他们认为各大中央银行当前有两个目标：恢复低失业率和低通胀情况下的强劲增长，以及维持金融稳定不出现泡沫。	Central banks, they argue, now have two goals: restoring robust growth and low unemployment with low inflation, and maintaining financial stability without bubbles.
皮凯蒂指出，在法国和其他国家 ， “ 资本”的崛起主要是因为房地产升值，其唯一原因是好地段在日益网络化的经济中变得更有价值。	The rise of “capital,” which Piketty documents in France and other countries, is caused mostly by the appreciation of real estate, simply because good locations become more valuable in an increasingly networked economy.
标准衡量指标表明生产率增长有所下降，但所有其他指标显示真实生产率增长正在上升，原因在于市场产品和服务于新兴信息和通讯技术的协同效应。	While standard measures show productivity growth falling, all other indicators suggest that true productivity growth is leaping ahead, owing to synergies between market goods and services and emerging information and communication technologies.
归根结底，无论中国的一党制国家资本主义还是俄国的财阀政治经济都与“自由”相去甚远，而这两国也并不避讳以军事手段维护其自我认同权。	After all, neither China’s one-party state-capitalist system nor Russia’s plutocratic political economy is particularly liberal, and neither country is especially averse to asserting its (self-identified) rights by military means.
如今，这样的例子包括缅甸和朝鲜；而实行经济自由化之前的中国、越南和印度同样如此。 对于发展中国家来说，为了彻底摆脱危机，为在全球化的世界中实现全面可持续性的增长打好基础，它们必须在2010年以及之后的岁月里，从历史中汲取正确的经验教训。	To ensure a durable exit from the crisis, and to build foundations for sustained and broad-based growth in a globalized world, developing countries in 2010 and beyond must draw the right lessons from history.
更令人惊奇的是，发过驳回了针对另一位亿万富翁、俄罗斯联邦议会前成员苏利曼·克里莫夫（Suleyman Kerimov）的洗钱指控，而他真的与克里姆林宫关系密切。	More surprising, France dismissed a money-laundering charge brought against another billionaire, Suleyman Kerimov, though Kerimov, a member of Russia’s Federation Council, does maintains close ties to the Kremlin.
荷兰的否决票是他们反对法国和德国利益控制下的合作主义欧洲的一个信号，也表达了他们对鲍肯内得（Balkenende）政府不得人心的保守说教政策的抗议。	A Dutch No would signal rejection of a corporatist Europe dominated by French and German interests, as well as representing a protest against the unpopular conservative and moralistic policies of the Balkenende government.
她预期欧盟提供的48亿欧元资金至少能够在撒哈拉以南非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲撬动660亿欧元的金融机构和私人企业投资。	She expects that €4.8 billion in EU grants would leverage at least €66 billion in investment in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America by financial institutions and private firms.
最新发布的报告《走向绿色经济：可持续发展和消除贫困之道 》 （ Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication）现实，现有的市场经济导致了资本前所未有的配置失当。	As the recently released report “Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication” shows, the market economy as currently constituted has resulted in the misallocation of capital on an unprecedented scale.
该步骤尽管基本无可挑剔，但是采取这一步骤明显准备不足，执行不力，并且政府对其给国家预算可能带来的效果犯了严重失算。	Despite the fundamental soundness of the step, it was poorly prepared and implemented, and the government seriously miscalculated its effects on the national budget.
以色列的右翼政党获得了来自正统派（Orthodox）和极端正统派社区、约旦河西岸定居者以及大量西班牙裔和俄罗斯裔犹太人的支持。	Israel’s right-wing parties draw support from the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox communities, West Bank settlers, and a large part of the Sephardic and Russian communities.
但在十九世纪，当玛丽安成为法兰西共和国标志的时候，只有希腊诸神和其他神话女主人公的绘画或雕塑等理想形式的裸体才可以被公众接受。	Yet, in the nineteenth century, when Marianne became a symbol of the French Republic, nudity was acceptable only in an idealized form, in paintings or sculptures of Greek deities and other mythical heroines.
年轻一代的伊朗人是后革命时期大规模婴儿潮的产物，他们正感到越来越沮丧，越来越没有信心，还有一点不出人们所料，那就是年轻的伊朗人生育子女的数量少于以往任何时候。	Iran’s youthful population – a product of the massive post-revolution baby boom – is increasingly frustrated and depressed; not surprisingly, young Iranians are having fewer children than ever.
当一个国家的国家艺术珍品被劫掠后，我们不能把归还成为“重新国有化 ” 。 因为这本来就属于这个国家。	When a country is robbed of a national art treasure, we don’t call its return “re-nationalization,” because it belonged to the country all along.
这是个危险而动荡的组合，其理论和方法基础曾经导致俄罗斯帝国 — — 不管是沙皇帝国还是苏联帝国 — — 失败和毁灭。	It is a dangerous and volatile mix, relying on principles and methods that led Russia’s empires – Czarist and Soviet – to failure and ruin.
公投结果出来后不出几小时 ， “ 脱欧”阵营领导人就开始“反水 ” ， 激起了许多选民的愤怒，特别是那些因为渴望削减移民而支持英国退出的人。	Within hours of the referendum result, the “Leave” campaign’s leaders began to backtrack, spurring anger among many voters, particularly those whose support for Brexit had been driven by the desire to cut immigration.
除了吸烟之外的风险因素包括食用饱和的动物油、肥胖、大量饮酒、缺乏运动以及缺乏食用水果和蔬菜。 减少这些风险因素的措施迄今没有什么成效。	Measures to reduce risk factors other than smoking – high intake of saturated animal fat, obesity, binge drinking of alcohol, physical inactivity, and low fruit and vegetable consumption – have had little success.
经济学家David Ricardo在1817年就指出如果英国和葡萄牙都能发挥各自的比较优势，那么这对双方都会是有利的。	The economist David Ricardo pointed out in 1817 that both Great Britain and Portugal would benefit if they exploited their comparative advantages.
在南斯拉夫，斯洛文尼亚，塞尔维亚以及克罗地亚在20世纪90年代初成功创建了独立的共和国，但是，在波斯尼亚－黑塞哥维那的穆斯林就不是那么成功了。	In Yugoslavia, the Slovenes, Serbs, and Croats managed to carve out independent republics in the early 1990’s, but the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina were less successful.
简言之，国大党领导的统一进步联盟（United Progressive Alliance，简称UPA）所采取的胆怯和犹豫到近乎瘫痪的地步的时代已经一去不返了。	In short, an era of timidity and hesitation, bordering on paralysis, under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) has ended.
这一关键事实将指引以“人类城市”为主题的6月举行的新城市基金会第二届年度峰会的讨论，并理应成为可持续城市化举措的核心议题。	This crucial fact will guide discussion at the New Cities Foundation’s second annual summit in June – the theme of which is “The Human City” – and should be at the heart of sustainable urbanization initiatives.
美国联邦调查局（FBI）所发布的文件显示，一名FBI特工“好几次”目睹被关押者“以婴儿的姿势被手脚同铐在地上 ” ， 没有椅子、食物或水。	The US Federal Bureau of Investigation released documents showing that an FBI agent witnessed “on several occasions” detainees who were “chained hand and foot in [a] fetal position to [the] floor,” without a chair, or food or water.
加拿大《环球邮报》在9月2日披露了陷入混战的卡扎非政权与一些和中国政府有直接联系的军火公司的谈判细节，其合同总值高达2亿美元。	On September 2, the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported on recent negotiations between the embattled Qaddafi regime and Chinese armaments companies with direct ties to China’s government for contracts worth $200 million.
更何况今年的焦点也无法逆转地从他们身上转向了别处：北非和中东的数百万民众开始争取一个具备基本民主权利和法治的正常社会。	And the focus this year has shifted decisively away from it. Millions of people in North Africa and the Middle East have started to demand a normal society with basic democratic rights and, above all, the rule of law.
如果说最近的事件教会了我们什么，那就是对欧盟的威胁不是来自财政风险共担不足，而是来自外交政策和安全挑战协作不够。	If recent events have taught us anything, it is that threats to the EU stem not from inadequate fiscal risk-sharing, but from insufficient coordination on foreign-policy and security challenges.
尽管脸书一直认定自己不会向广告商出售数据，但该公司最近发现政治咨询公司剑桥分析（Cambridge Analytica）已经从自己那里收集了将近9000万用户的数据。	Despite Facebook’s insistence that it does not sell data to advertisers, the company was recently found to have allowed nearly 90 million users’ data to be harvested by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
在上周方济各在罗马会见CEO们的同时，巴塞洛缪也召集了科学机构、联合国机构和雅典和伯罗奔尼撒的主要宗教人士，共同勾勒环境安全之路。	As Francis was meeting the CEOs in Rome last week, Bartholomew was similarly convening leaders of scientific institutions, UN agencies, and major faiths in Athens and the Peloponnese, to chart a path to environmental safety.
但有两点是比较明确的：不同的国家（不管是任意还是必须）所冀望的结果各有不同；而把各方协调在一个整体全球体制框架下则需要花费很大力气。	Yet two things seem clear: different countries are opting, either by choice or necessity, for different outcomes; and the global system as a whole faces challenges in reconciling them.
尽管由资源引发的战略竞争将持续影响亚洲的安全态势，但如果亚洲领导人建立以规则为基础的合作规则和制度其风险也可以相应减轻。	While strategic competition for resources will continue to shape Asia’s security dynamics, the associated risks can be moderated if Asia’s leaders establish norms and institutions aimed at building rule-based cooperation.
但它也有可能以进步联邦主义和抵制新时代元年而被铭记，进步联邦主义和抵制的排头兵是受到公民信任、相信它们能改善自己的生活和社区的州和地方政府。	But it may also be remembered as the start of a new era of progressive federalism and resistance, championed by state and local governments trusted by their citizens to help improve their lives and communities.
其基础设施，无论是物资还是智力，都更为匮乏，并且其经济结构不能适应新的挑战，主要原因是公司的规模、专注于传统行业以及教育和研发水平低下。	Its infrastructure, both material and intellectual, was poorer, and its economic structure was unfit for the new challenges, owing both to firm size and their specialization in traditional sectors, as well as low levels of education and R&D.
果不其然，2016年预计全球GDP增长率只有3.1 % ， 世界贸易增长更是大幅下降，从2.7%下降到只有1.9 % 。	And, sure enough, in 2016, it is estimated that global GDP again grew by only 3.1%, while world trade growth slowed substantially, from 2.7% to an anemic 1.9%.
纵观美国历史 ， 《 平价医疗法案 》 （ “奥巴马医疗法案 ” ） 成功地将更多人纳入私人保险系统，并使更多人能够享受医疗保健服务。	The Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) is providing more people with access to health care – and bringing more people to privately-issued insurance – than ever before in the United States.
对此欧元区两个最大的经济体 — — 法国和德国 — — 之间的新一轮大型谈判需要尽快展开而非拖而不决，而在此期间必须寻求制定一系列解决欧元困境的技术方案。	A new grand bargain between the eurozone’s two largest economies, France and Germany, will be needed sooner rather than later. In the meantime, the search for technical solutions to the euro’s woes must be pursued.
尽管法国政府跟西班牙和意大利两国政府有所区别，可以毫无困难地以低利率为自身融资，但在国家经济进入衰退时货币升值就像向未点燃的篝火增加燃料一样。	Although the French government, unlike its Spanish and Italian counterparts, has not yet had any difficulty financing itself at low interest rates, currency appreciation as the economy slides into recession is like fuel poured onto an unlit bonfire.
因此投资EMBI+意味着当华尔街分析师告诉您该国确实在让人民忍饥挨饿以避免重组您的债券时，您对此深感欣慰。	So investing in the EMBI+ means that you rejoice when Wall Street analysts inform you that the country is literally starving its people in order to avoid restructuring your bonds.
在1997之后，香港政府进一步确保了立法者在引发辩论、立法和修正法律方面本已有限的权力被进一步削弱。	After 1997, Hong Kong's government made doubly sure that legislators' already limited powers to initiate debates, legislation, and amendments to laws were further restricted.
除了改善公共产品的供给，他所推动的 “中华民族复兴之梦 ” ， 其部分目的也是为了鼓励人们超越对物质财富的追求。	Beyond improving the provision of public goods, his promotion of the so-called China Dream of national rejuvenation has been aimed, in part, at encouraging people to seek fulfillment beyond material wealth.
困扰整个中东的既有战争又有不断深化的发展失败：越来越严重的淡水紧张、荒漠化、青年失业率过高、糟糕的教育体系和其他严重的发展障碍。	The entire Middle East is beset not only by wars but also by deepening development failures: intensifying fresh water stress, desertification, high youth unemployment, poor educational systems, and other serious blockages.
这样的变化不过认可了人类一直以来就承认的事实：在遭受打击后出现剧烈的悲伤情绪虽然痛苦，但却是人类不可避免会出现的状况，而不一定是一种精神疾病。	Such a change would acknowledge what humans have always recognized: intense sadness after loss is a painful and perhaps inevitable aspect of the human condition, but it is not necessarily a mental disorder.
如今法国拥有了一位充满活力的新领导人，对应的德国首脑又一次得到了民众的授权，也就为两国共同去纠正这个作品的最严重缺陷创造了机会。	With a dynamic new leader in one country and a fresh popular mandate in the other, there is now an opportunity for France and Germany to correct their creation’s worst flaws.
随着互联网拓展至物联网实体空间等全新领域，无秩序主义代价将成为社会关键指标，利用大数据分析消灭无秩序主义将越来越具有诱惑力。	As the Internet expands into new realms of physical space through the Internet of Things, the price of anarchy will become a crucial metric in our society, and the temptation to eliminate it with the power of big data analytics will grow stronger.
曾经，决策通过政治中心的谈判形成 — — 这也是西方民主长期以来的“锚 ” — —而如今日益受到极左和极右顽固势力的影响。	Once formulated through negotiations conducted at the political center, where Western democracies have long been anchored, policymaking is increasingly shaped by stubborn forces on the extreme left and right.
亚洲的著名人士，如新加坡前领导人李光耀就警告欧洲人如果继续现在的道路，欧洲除了旅游业以及高尚私人宅第外将一无是处。	Prominent Asians, such as former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew, are now warning Europeans that if they continue on their current course, Europe will rapidly become irrelevant for anything other than tourism and high-end real estate.
哈佛经济学家里卡多·豪斯曼（Ricardo Hausmann）最近抨击了他所谓的“教育、教育、教育大军”鼓吹“只有教育”的增长战略。	Harvard economist Ricardo Hausmann recently berated what he describes as the “education, education, education crowd” for advocating an “education-only” strategy for growth.
目前正为卡扎非第三子沙阿迪提供庇护的尼日尔总统马哈马杜·伊素福正是依靠卡扎菲的金钱才能在今年3月赢得选举。	Niger’s President Mahamadou Issoufou, who is now harboring Qaddafi’s third son, Saadi, was able to win his country’s presidential election last March thanks to financial support from Qaddafi.
纽约 — — 德州州长佩里（Rick Perry）首次在德州之外开火了，他指责奥巴马“姑息”巴勒斯坦人。	NEW YORK – On a rare foray outside his native Texas, Governor Rick Perry accused US President Barack Obama of “appeasement” towards the Palestinians.
现在，假设阿根廷私营农业出口商也发行国际债券，用所筹得的美元扩大其一座竞争力很强的现代化牛奶厂，从扩大销往亚洲的奶粉量。	Now suppose one of Argentina’s private agricultural exporters also issues an international bond and uses the dollars to enlarge one of its modern, highly competitive dairy plants, in order to sell more powdered milk to Asia.
这与氦支持着美国大量就业的事实一起，已导致最近美国国会采取措施试图保证全球氦储备的三分之一流动起来，但价格会有所上涨。	This, together with the fact that helium underpins much US employment, may have contributed to the US Congress’s recent efforts to keep one-third of the world’s helium supply flowing, but at higher prices.
再进一步，假设希腊政府提出对苹果在雅典备案的欧洲其他地区的销售收入减免企业所得税20年 — — 比方说130亿欧元。	Suppose further that the Greek government proposed waiving corporate tax for 20 years on all revenue Apple earned in the rest of the EU but booked in Athens – say, €13 billion.
因此，我们不能因为它限制了自由而拒绝这样的法律，相反，我们应该捍卫它，将它视为让个人和企业巨头平等竞争的方法，让我们的理性和思考不再受到掣肘。	Instead of rejecting such laws as restricting freedom, therefore, we should defend them as ways to level the playing field between individuals and giant corporations that make no pretense of appealing to our capacities for reasoning and reflection.
去年9月，塞拉利昂对本国公共卫生设施和医疗人员的分布状况进行了评估，以指导有关“2017~21年医疗卫生人才战略”的讨论。	Last September, Sierra Leone conducted an assessment of the distribution of public-health facilities and health workers in the country, in order to guide discussions on the Human Resources for Health Strategy 2017-2021.
2014年，英国扩大了年收入不到16,190英镑的家庭的公共支持，以使两岁儿童能够接受每年38周、每周15小时的的教育。	In 2014, the United Kingdom expanded public support for families earning less than £16,190 ($23,648) per year to enable two-year-olds to receive 15 hours of education per week for 38 weeks per year.
2010年，IMF开始寻求振兴，试图在解决欧元危机中表现出核心作用 — — 第一步便是在希腊援助融资中起到作用。	In 2010, the IMF made a play for resurrection, presenting itself as central to solving the euro crisis – beginning with its role in financing the Greek bailout.
它们不但训练下一代医生、记者、律师和社会领袖；它们也为孩子们提供导师、食物、水和关于基本健康和卫生的知识。	They not only train the next generation of doctors, journalists, lawyers, and community leaders; they also furnish children with mentors, food, water, and knowledge about basic health and sanitation.
鉴于中国是全球第二大经济体，欧洲和国际货币基金组织的官员们也就迅速反应，分别调低了对本地区和全球经济的增长预期。	Given that China is the second largest economy in the world, it didn’t take long for European officials to reduce their own growth projections, and for the International Monetary Fund to revise downward its expectations for global growth.
所以说，那些查出某个因素与某种健康效应相关的研究只能被视为一个初步的研究成果，其作用仅限于指导研究人员继续深入研究和分析。	Studies that show an association between a factor and a health effect should be regarded as no more than a preliminary result that points researchers toward further research and analysis.
为了达到有效的平衡，行动计划建议成立两个公共所有的投资基金 — — 一个从机构投资者筹资，另一个从个人筹资。	To strike an effective balance, the action plan proposes two publicly owned investment funds – one raising money from institutional investors, and the other from individuals.
这里的讽刺之处 — — 并非只有大银行财务主管 — — 是银行在竭力通过发行股本和留存利润增加资本以满足审慎监管机构的要求，与此同时，这些资金又在以同样的速度被监管者罚没。	The irony here – not lost on the major banks’ finance directors – is that as fast as banks add capital from rights issues and retained earnings to meet the demands of prudential regulators, the funds are drained away by conduct regulators.
而这方面的指控势必会引起怀疑，质疑法院是否有反塞族的阴谋；倘若不指控的话，又会反过来激发对法院未能履行自身职责的指责。	Prosecuting that decision would have inflamed suspicions of an anti-Serbian plot; choosing not to prosecute would have incited countervailing charges that the Tribunal was not fulfilling its mandate.
那些技巧高超的人知道怎样通过认真准备茶道工具，有意义的谈话以及自然但是控制良好的身体动作，来改善客人的茶道体验。	Those with high ability know how the guests’ experience can be improved with careful preparations of tools, reflective conversations, and natural yet well-controlled body motions.
过去十五年中世界在帮助最穷人群方面取得的进步是千载难遇的好好消息，因此，当重大退步，比如新传染病的爆发发生时，通常并不那么引人注目。	The progress that the world has made in helping the poorest in the last 15 years is the kind of good-news story that happens one life at a time, so it often does not have the same visibility as a big setback, such as the outbreak of a new epidemic.
相反，心理驱动力 — — 包括提升自尊感、吸引力或男性气概的需求 — — 可能是捕食者滥用权力主宰或侮辱他人的驱动因素。	Rather, psychological drives – including the need to boost one’s sense of self-esteem, attractiveness, or masculinity – may be driving predators’ abuse of power in dominating or degrading others.
利用技术还需要落实明智的经济改革，进一步改善基础设施，提高机构执行力以及制定面向边缘人口提供数字解决方案的战略。	Harnessing technology will also require sensible economic reforms, better infrastructure, more capable institutions, and strategies to deliver digital solutions to marginalized populations.
这也绝不仅仅是一个比方：在普京领导下，俄罗斯已经至少修建了六座大桥，其中一座甚至将克里米亚与俄罗斯大陆相联通。	Nor is that a mere metaphor: under Putin’s leadership, Russia has built at least a half-dozen bridges, including one connecting Crimea to Russia’s mainland.
他还未能解决上述所有问题，然而除了允许自己任由以色列总理内塔尼亚胡摆布，以及令中国人相信他正在照中国的意思构建一个新的中美双边关系之外，似乎也没有出什么大的纰漏。	But it is difficult to see any really bad mistakes, except perhaps allowing himself to be pushed around by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and giving China the impression that he was prepared for a bilateral relationship entirely on China’s terms.
同样，Kureha这个年销售额1300亿日元的化工企业负责供应全球70%的锂电池黏性材料 — — 锂电池虽小，却是手机不可或缺的部件。	Likewise, the chemical manufacturer Kureha (¥130 billion in annual sales) has a 70% share of the global market for adhesive materials for lithium-ion batteries – a small but essential component of cell phones.
麦凯恩显然具有相同的品质，更不用说其个人的英勇程度远超我们多数人（应当指出的是卡林顿本人也是战斗英雄 ） 。	McCain plainly had the same qualities, not to mention a level of personal bravery far beyond what is expected of most of us (though it should be noted that Carrington was also a war hero).
社会保障体系的精算师们可能并没有完全认识到如今技术革命带来的冲击力，而是显而易见地继续推进了这一政府能够负担得起的体制的规模。	Social Security’s actuaries may not have fully recognized the impact of today’s technological revolutions, but they have markedly boosted the scale of the system that the US government can afford.
安全部门的有效治理需要政府高层拥有持续的政治意愿，尤其得准备对与安全部门有交集的政府和经济部门进行改革。	Effective governance of the security sector requires sustained political will at the top of the government, particularly a readiness to push reforms to sectors of the government and economy with which the security sector interacts.
美国经济 — — 以及其他许多国家的经济 — — 未来能够增长得更快，如果决策者实施恰当的改革的话。	America’s economy – and those of many other countries – could grow faster in the future if policymakers adopt the appropriate reforms.
在埃及，民选总统、穆斯林兄弟会的穆尔西的支持正仍在与军方和安全部队作斗争。 穆尔西于今年6月被军方推翻。	In Egypt, supporters of the democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood are still battling the army and security forces, which deposed him in July.
在美国它是美联储，以及由美联储和其他联邦，州还有自行监管机构所制定的大量关于如何汇款或提供信贷的规则。	In the United States, it’s the Federal Reserve, and there a large number of rules – made by the Fed as well as other federal, state, and self-regulatory bodies – regarding how one may send money or extend credit.
如今，所有来日旅客都会学会两个关键词 ： “ 多末 ” ， 意思是“你好 ” 、 “谢谢”或“很好 ” ； 以及“斯米马赛 ” ， 它包括了domo的全部含义，还可以表达“对不起”和“劳驾 ” 。	Anyone visiting Japan today would do well to learn two key words: domo, meaning “hello,” “thanks,” or “well,” and sumimasen, which can carry any of the meanings of domo, as well as “sorry” or “excuse me.”
但是，在美国，美国国家航空航天局在其超过100亿美元的年度预算中只花费4百万美元用于测绘大的构成危险的近距离小行星。	Nevertheless, in the United States, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spends only $4 million of its annual budget of more than $10 billion on mapping dangerously close large asteroids.
大量既得利益者，包括地方政府和国有企业，抵制变化；大量私人和公共债务将爆发问题；而中国领导层对于应该以多快的节奏实施改革措施也存在分歧。	Many vested interests, including local governments and state-owned enterprises, are resisting change; a huge volume of private and public debt will go sour; and the country’s leadership is divided on how quickly reforms should be implemented.
华盛顿 — — 随着世界在持续金融和经济危机的阴影下进入新的一年，我们必须以更广阔的视野去看待全球经济的未来轮廓。	WASHINGTON, DC – As the world enters yet another year in the shadow of continued financial and economic crisis, a broader view of the contours of the future global economy is required.
当然，鉴于发达经济体开始拥抱更偏重国内的民粹主义和民族主义政治，一个“大爆炸”式的重振特别提款权手段基本不可能被采用。	Of course, given the advanced economies’ embrace of more inward-looking, populist, and nationalist politics, a “big bang” approach to reinvigorating the SDR is highly unlikely.
但我们认为新公约所规定的、正被各成员国越来越多地使用的有效多数票（qualified majority voting）方式，也应该适用于公约的批准过程本身。	We believe, though, that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embodied in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself.
如果政府不能利用成本冲击和经济减速带来的机会实施必要的结构性改革，中国的潜在增长率将如TFP所显示的那样永远无法完全恢复。	If it fails to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the cost shock and economic slowdown to implement the necessary structural reforms, China’s potential growth rate, as dictated by TFP, will never rebound fully.
让这一不确定性与众不同并且将带来真正的后果的是其中两位候选人，即国民阵线的马丽娜·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）和极左翼领导人让-卢克·梅朗雄（r Jean-Luc Mélenchon ） ， 所支持的政策与法国和欧洲主流相去甚远。	What makes this uncertainty different and truly consequential is that two of the four, National Front leader Marine Le Pen and far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, support policies far outside the French and European mainstream.
而且人工智能的应用不仅限于在线零售：据A.T. Kearney咨询公司统计，实体商店依然在零售行业中占据90%的份额。	And AI’s applications extend beyond online retail: Brick-and-mortar stores still account for 90% of retail sales, according to the consultancy A.T. Kearney.
在执政两年间，利比亚国民议会（GNC）将权力交给国家以外的主体，各部委绕过军队委派民兵执行安全任务。 塔希夫塔意识到这种方法有问题。	In its two years in power, the parliament, known as the General National Congress (GNC), has empowered non-state actors, with ministries bypassing the army to task militias with security operations.
一个显著的例子是国际原子能机构在谈判期间被授权进入可疑设施，而当检查者到达时，遭到了地方军官的横眉冷对、礼送出境。	This was evident in cases where the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted access to suspected facilities during the negotiations, only to have local commanders turn away its inspectors when they arrived.
而他现在承担了在一片焦土上重新建设的重任，承担了确保一条设想的政治道路终结不会导致政治也随之终结的重任。	And to him now falls the task of rebuilding upon a ruined field, of working to ensure that the end of a certain way of conceiving politics does not mean the end of politics as such.
在奥朗德看来，经济好转 — — 复苏（la reprise ） — —才刚刚开始，希望的曙光刚刚显现。	According to Hollande, the economic upturn – la reprise – had just started, and hope was around the corner.
更糟的是，直到最近，一个负责评价经济学家的委员会甚至认为撰写一本与经典理论有不同观点的通俗经济学读物在专业上是不道德的。	Worse than that, at least until recently, a committee evaluating an economist would likely think that writing a popular economics book that does not repeat the received wisdom of the discipline might even be professionally unethical.
亚洲国家一向不愿意承担开发新药的成本，新药研发回报远低于美国水平，研发生产率也比美国和欧洲落后多年。	Asian countries have tended to be reluctant to shoulder the cost of developing new medicines, with reimbursements falling far short of US levels, and their R&D productivity will not match that of the US and Europe for several more years.
他的继任者，马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）实践了这一观点，用一系列关键指标指引下的限制性自由决定权取代了固定的政策法则。	His successor, Mark Carney, has come to embody this view, eschewing fixed policy rules in favor of the constrained discretion implied by guidance ranges for key indicators.
去年美国人口普查显示，生活在贫困线以下的美国人口数量显著增加，这当然与缺乏健康保险密切相关，但同时也反映出美国过度依赖以雇主为基础的保险覆盖体系。	The last US census showed a marked increase in the number of Americans living below the poverty line, a fact closely related to lack of health insurance, which in turn reflects over-reliance on employer-based insurance coverage.
她的崛起一直注重于象征意义-她在她治理的北方邦建造了无数贱民领导人的雕像，尤其是她自己的雕像，她对奢华的庆祝活动也特别爱好。	Her ascent has been marked by a heavy emphasis on symbolism – her rule in Uttar Pradesh has featured the construction of numerous statues of Dalit leaders, notably herself – and a taste for lavish celebrations.
一旦这些援助迅��到位，从前的士兵就会返回到自己的故里，并在敌对状态结束后通过种植第一季庄稼开始新的生活。	When such aid is made available quickly, former soldiers will return to their farms, and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities.
萨科奇上任后所体现出的疯狂特点已经开始弱化了：这个特点是一个动议分裂成另一个动议，每个都给手头上的问题提出了改造性的解决方案，而任何反对意见都被指责是谎言、不守诚信和怯懦。	The manic character of his presidency – initiative spilling into initiative, each being the transformative solution to the problem at hand, all opposition denounced as lies, bad faith, and cowardice – has worn thin.
但还有一位英国首相能与之媲美：她就是玛格丽特•撒切尔，一位非常有争议的人物，喜欢她的人和讨厌她的人一样多。	But there is one other British prime minister who may come close: Margaret Thatcher, a highly contentious figure, who was loved by some and loathed by others.
amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 鉴于难以在金融体制上开倒车以及欧洲单一市场的限制，因此欧洲国家行动的方向也就明了了。	Given the difficulty of rolling back the financial clock and the constraints of the Single Market, it is clear which way European countries will move.
总之，一方面要加强公共卫生、生物安全与生物安全（biosecurity ） ， 另一方面要防止生物恐怖主义。 这两类行动相互关联，互为补充。	In short, promoting public health, biosafety, and biosecurity, on the one hand, and protecting against bioterrorism, on the other, are linked, complementary activities.
同样，在其他情况下有可能将活跃投资者视为天敌的人可能会赞同他们的立场，比方说关注高管薪酬或企业的社会责任。	Likewise, those who in other circumstances might see activist investors as natural adversaries can agree with the positions that they take, such as concerns about executive compensation or corporate social responsibility.
很长时间以来，人们一直认为与参议院相比，民主党更有可能赢得众议院，因为即将参与选举的几个参议院席位都掌握在传统保守州的民主党人手中。	It has long been believed that the Democrats are more likely to win the House than the Senate, because several of the Senate seats in play are held by Democrats in traditionally conservative states.
在此看来陷入混乱的委内瑞拉成为第一个国家背书加密货币 （ “ Petro ” ） 的发行者绝非巧合。	It is no coincidence that dysfunctional Venezuela is the first issuer of a state-backed cryptocurrency (the “Petro”).
在过去十年中，数千万非洲人加入了中产阶级行列；我们的城市正在快速扩大；我们的人口也是世界上最年轻的。	Over the past decade, tens of millions of people across Africa have joined the middle class; our cities are expanding rapidly; and our population is the most youthful in the world.
香港—像我这样的经济学家，经常被人问到可能影响企业、个人和机构在经济、教育、就业以及政策预期等方面的选择的问题。	HONG KONG – Economists like me are asked a set of recurring questions that might inform the choices of firms, individuals, and institutions in areas like investment, education, and jobs, as well as their policy expectations.
在多边主义的框架下，各国必须通力合作，减少分歧并深化关系，因此我们必须克服的，就是那种将我们引向旧思维 — — 和旧联盟 — — 的惰性。	Within the framework of multilateralism, countries must make the effort to smooth over their differences and deepen their relations: we must conquer the inertia that moves us towards old thinking – and old alliances.
据联合国维和行动部的资料，UNIFIL的年预算是9400万美金并由于成员国拖欠付款而经受着长期的资金短缺。	According to the UN’s Department of Peacekeeping Operations, up to now UNIFIL has operated on an annual budget of $94 million and suffers chronic budget shortfalls due to unpaid assessments from member states.
同样欠妥的，还有布什关于必须接受以色列在巴领土上的永久性存在和不允许巴勒斯坦难民重返其以色列家园这些既成事实的言论。	The same is true with respect to the President’s assertion that Israel’s permanent presence in Palestinian territories and the non-return of Palestinian refugees to their homes in Israel must be accepted as realities on the ground.
有一条被认为重要的线路，是从欧洲（西班牙）出发，经由新加坡或者杜拜，穿过印度到尼泊尔或孟加拉国，然后再次返回到印度内的市场。	One such line, which is presumed to be significant, goes from Europe (Spain) via Singapore or Dubai, through India to Nepal or Bangladesh and back again to the market in India.
但如果世界领导人认真对待阻止森林流失的问题，就应该放弃REDD+，替之以解决大规模采伐的根本动机的机制。	But if world leaders are serious about halting forest loss, they should instead abandon REDD+ and replace it with a mechanism that addresses the underlying drivers of large-scale deforestation.
在这个过程中，它们采用了脸谱公司文化 — — “迅速移动，打破一切 ” — —丝毫不顾对人民、制度和民主所造成的影响。	In the process, they are adopting versions of Facebook’s corporate philosophy – “move fast and break things” – without regard for the impact on people, institutions, and democracy.
吉姆·沃尔芬森最强大的力量体现在他对世界贫穷人口的关注，他留给我们的是致力于消除世界贫困的世界银行。	Jim Wolfensohn’s greatest strength has been his genuine caring for the world’s poor. His legacy will include a World Bank that is firmly committed to a world free of poverty.
沙特阿拉伯也在1970年代意识到了这一点，为了扩展其影响力，该国资助了数千所学校和学院来传授其保守严厉的瓦哈比伊斯兰思想。	Saudi Arabia recognized it in the 1970’s as it sought to expand its influence, and over the years the Kingdom has funded thousands of schools and colleges that teach its stringent brand of Wahhabi Islam.
但如果我们对过去六十年所取得的成绩进行长久、冷静的思考 — — 同时也必须正视哪些问题抵制住了我们的努力 — — 那么有一点也非常清楚，那就是单靠有效的责任体系并不能解决问题。	Yet if we take a long, hard look at what has been achieved over the past six decades – and at what remains resistant to all our efforts – then it is also clear that this will not be enough.
事实上，劳动报酬不平等已成为收入不平等高企的最大原因，收入分配的最顶层除外，对他们来说，资本所得更加重要。	Indeed, inequality in labor compensation has been the largest driver of yawning income inequality, except at the very top of the income distribution, where capital income has been more important.
可能当我们意识到一个女性将对自身的认识构建那些外在的，职场上的成就之上是多么无意义的时候，就会一种醍醐灌顶的感觉 — — 而这也将成为我们迈向更深的自由，以及对女性命运更深认识的第一步。	Perhaps seeing how futile it is to rest one’s sense of self on externalized, professionalized achievement is a wake-up call – and a first step to a deeper freedom, and an even deeper sense of feminine destiny.
一个根本性（也被广泛接受的）协调目标应是减少类似于近几年来因欧盟外部盈余增加从而迫使许多新兴经济体赤字抬头而造成的失衡。	One essential (and generally agreed) goal of such coordination should be to reduce global imbalances like those caused in recent years by the European Union’s rising external surplus, which has forced many emerging economies to run growing deficits.
这要求建立和维持公平、高效的投入和产出市场，让他们有机会和大农一样进入实体和虚拟市场，从而增加收入。	This requires building and maintaining fair and efficient input and output markets that connect them – as well as larger-scale farmers – physically and virtually to opportunities to increase their incomes.
其次，中国希望推进其战略利益，包括扩大外交影响力、确保自然资源、扩大人民币的国际使用，以及获得相对其他强国的优势。	And, second, it hopes to advance its strategic interests, including expanding its diplomatic influence, securing natural resources, promoting the international use of its currency, and gaining a relative advantage over other powers.
如今马克隆也迎来了他的施罗德时刻，他似乎也选择了理性实用主义，拒绝盲目执行那些（在任何情况下都不合理的）僵化规则。	Now is Macron’s Schröderian moment. He, too, appears to have opted for reasoned pragmatism over the blind implementation of rigid rules (which cannot make sense under any circumstances).
格林发现当人们被要求对有关“个人化”侵犯（如将那个陌生人推下天桥）的情况做出道德判断时，他们的脑部与情感相关的区域活动增加。	Greene found that people asked to make a moral judgment about “personal” violations, like pushing the stranger off the footbridge, showed increased activity in areas of the brain associated with the emotions.
首先，正如已故的鲁迪格·多恩布什（Rüdiger Dornbusch）所言，金融危机可能需要很长时间发展，但一旦爆发，就会非常迅速、广泛、暴力 、 （ 似乎）不加区别地蔓延。	For starters, as the late Rüdiger Dornbusch argued, financial crises can take a long time to develop, but once they erupt, they tend to spread rapidly, widely, violently, and (seemingly) indiscriminately.
而在西班牙，另一个极左翼政党社会民主党（Podemos）的崛起终结了中左翼的西班牙社会工人党（Socialist Workers’ Party）和中右翼的人民党（Partido Popular）的传统霸权。	And in Spain, the emergence of Podemos, another new left-wing party, has ended the traditional hegemony of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party on the center left and the Partido Popular on the center right.
此外延迟加息也有其风险，因为这会鼓励渴望收益的投资者冒更大的风险 — — 而这可能会在未来造成更剧烈或更突然的利率变化。	Furthermore, a delay in raising rates carries its own dangers, encouraging yield-hungry investors to take larger risks – possibly necessitating a sharper or more abrupt change in interest rates in the future.
虽然对该余额的计算存在着国民生产总值（GDP）与国民总收入（GNI）两个数据之间的统计差异，但这不是一个理论，而是一个定义。	That’s not a theory. It’s an identity, save for any statistical discrepancy between gross national product (GDP) and gross national income (GNI).
其中一些经济学家虽然认识到当前紧张局势会增加政策意外或错误的风险，但将其视为摆明姿态和谈判的一部分。	For example, one group, while recognizing that the current tensions increase the risk of a policy accident or mistake, views them as part of a process of posturing and negotiation.
气候变化继续摧残着巴基斯坦，而巴基斯坦决不能允许它因为世界最大污染国蒙受数十亿美元的损失而得不到补偿。	As climate change continues to take its terrible toll, Pakistan cannot allow the billions of dollars in damages it suffers at the hands of the world’s largest polluters to go uncompensated.
近几年来，G-7央行之间再也没有进行过此类外汇操作，部分是因为，在理论上，除非汇率改变了货币供给，否则它们不会干预汇率。	Such foreign-exchange operations among G-7 central banks have fallen into disuse in recent years, partly owing to the theory that they do not affect exchange rates except when they change money supplies.
但是，不管宏观经济环境如何，从长期看独立工作占总工作的比重可能不断上升，原因就在于技术进步和个人偏好。	But, regardless of macroeconomic conditions, independent work is likely to account for a rising share of work in the long run, owing to technological advances and individual preferences.
美国入侵后，什叶派伊拉克军阀 — — 伊朗为他们提供资金和先机的爆炸装置支持 — — 时不时骚扰美军。	In the aftermath of the invasion, Shia Iraqi militias, which Iran had financed and armed with sophisticated explosive devices, regularly attacked US troops.
改革计划无疑将致力提升市场竞争力、实现信贷民主化、引入更先进的税收政策、改进公共服务的范围和质量，并且应对大规模和小范围的腐败举动。	The reform agenda will, no doubt, be defined by the need to make markets more competitive, democratize credit, introduce a more progressive tax policy, improve the quality and scope of public services, and tackle large-scale and petty corruption.
地区经济溢出效应因为借款人能够继续保持正常运行这一事实而得到遏制：信誉由借款人的基本面决定，而不是由其在哪个州决定。	The regional economic spillovers are limited by the fact that other borrowers can continue to function normally: creditworthiness is determined by a borrower’s fundamentals and not its state of residence.
这将需要在能源研究和开发新型技术方面持续加大投入 — — 需要更为强有力的公私营机构的合作予以支持。	This would require increasing investments in energy research and development for new and improved technologies – a process that needs to be supported by stronger public-private partnerships.
在危机发生之前，虽然包括IMF组织的在内，全球进行了多次高层对话，但所取得的成效甚微。 目前，危机已经蔓延到全球范围。	Prior to the crisis, there was plenty of talk, including high-level meetings brokered by the International Monetary Fund, but only minimal action.
莫斯科—在1979年的小说中《克里米亚岛 》 （ The Island of Crimea）中，瓦西里·阿克肖诺夫（Vasily Aksyonov）设想该地区因独立于苏联而繁荣。	MOSCOW – In his 1979 novel The Island of Crimea, Vasily Aksyonov imagined the region’s flourishing independence from the Soviet Union.
2007年世贸条约生效之前中国必须面对的最大挑战之一是为国内银行系统的民营化和与外国银行竞争做好准备。	One of the greatest challenges China must confront before the WTO treaty enters into force in 2007 is to prepare the country’s banking system for privatization and competition with foreign banks.
（上周这一主题还登上了《纽约时报》的头版，一篇文章引用一位前财政部官员的话说 ： “ 我们正在退出我们在国际舞台上的中心地位 。 ” ）	(Just last week, the topic made the front page of the New York Times, in an article that quoted a former treasury official as saying, “We’re withdrawing from the central place we held on the international stage.”)
而如果采用高盛公司自2013年开始应用的计算公式作为基准并撇除自那以后的实际升值的话，德国在欧元区内又会再便宜19 ％ 。	Moreover, Germany is 19% too cheap within the eurozone if one uses as a baseline a calculation by Goldman Sachs from 2013 and subtracts the appreciation in real terms since that time.
拉里·芬克、美国进步中心（Center for American Progress）和希拉里·克林顿都建议采取这一方针。	Among others, Larry Fink, the Center for American Progress, and Hillary Clinton propose this approach.
根据最新联合国报告，从1990年到2010年，非洲极端贫困人口增加了近40 % ， 达到4.14亿人。	According to a recent United Nations report, the number of Africans living in extreme poverty increased by almost 40%, to 414 million, from 1990 to 2010.
这一论调的另一个说法就是，中国具有自身民主形式，它建立在孔夫子政府仁义以及中国文化偏向于为了集体利益而牺牲个人权利的基础之上。	An alternative to this line of argument is to claim that China has its own kind of democracy, based on a Confucian idea of government benevolence and the Chinese people’s cultural propensity to sacrifice individual rights to collective goods.
布什政府必须领导西方与伊朗进行协调一致的直接谈判，并且要想使谈判取得成功，美国也必须同意提供适当的保证。	The Bush administration must lead the Western initiative in harmonized, direct negotiations with Iran, and, if these negotiations succeed, the US must also be willing to agree to appropriate guarantees.
自2009年第三季度大衰退结束以来的28个季度中，美国真实GDP增长只有2.1 % — —而此前可比的经济上升期平均增长率高达4 % 。	Real GDP growth in the US has averaged only 2.1% in the 28 quarters since the Great Recession ended in the third quarter of 2009 – barely half the 4% average pace in comparable periods of earlier upturns.
来自更高水平（政府）的金融支持总是以有助于不变化的形式出现（比如援助太大而不可倒的银行 ） ， 而不是以有助于变化的形式出现。	Financial support from higher levels (government) all too often takes the form of help not to change (bailouts of too-big-to-fail banks, for example), rather than help to change.
不幸的是，绝大多数人对这些研究成果视而不见，而且公司外汇销售人员可能厌烦了向客户提交大致相同的报告。	Unfortunately, these findings largely fell on deaf ears, and the firm’s foreign-exchange salespeople probably got bored passing on yet more of the same pieces to their clients.
考虑到这些挑战，在未来一段时间，化石燃料毫无疑问仍将在运输和重工业中起重要作用，即使它们在发电领域的作用日益衰减。	Given these challenges, fossil fuels will undoubtedly play a role in transport and heavy industry for some time to come, even as their role in electricity generation declines.
从1950年代到1980年代所进行的早期欧洲一体化使大国获得了显著得可以让政治家们轻易展现给选民看的利益。	In the earlier rounds of European integration, from the 1950’s to the 1980’s, the big states received very obvious gains, which their politicians could easily present as such to voters.
这个问题的答案不仅将决定总统奥朗德的政治前途，也将决定欧盟的未来，因为没有强大的德法联盟，欧洲危机将是不可克服的。	The answer will determine not only President François Hollande’s political future, but also the future of the EU, because, without a strong German-French tandem, Europe’s crisis cannot be overcome.
几个月来我一直在警告的金融崩溃在2月份爆发了，乌克兰格里夫尼亚在几天内贬值50 % ， 乌克兰国民银行不得不注入大量资金拯救银行系统。	The financial collapse of which I had been warning for months occurred in February, when the hryvnia’s value plummeted 50% in a few days, and the National Bank of Ukraine had to inject large amounts of money to rescue the banking system.
年轻的、特别是在西方的穆斯林正在确立一种范例，尽管中东国家予以大力压制，但还是缓慢地在那里得��回应。	Young Muslims, particularly in the West, are setting an example that is slowly being echoed in the Middle East, despite massive state repression.
（事实上，我是在一次招待会上对记者说这句话的，我说的是所有国家都需要改善其人权纪录 ， “ 即便是美国也不例外，但朝鲜大概是世界最差 。 ”	(What I had actually said, to a reporter at a reception, was that all countries need to work on their human-rights record, “even the United States, but North Korea’s is arguably the worst in the world.”)
这一问题，正如埃及研究员迪娜·埃尔哈瓦贾（Dina El-Khawaga）所指出的那样，在于可能无法“在结构性腐败的基础上引入改革 ” 。	The problem, as Egyptian researcher Dina El-Khawaga has argued, is that it may be impossible “to introduce reform on a structurally corrupt basis.”
事实上，日本至今仍在与失衡作斗争，因为它无法或不愿采取急需的结构改革 — — 即首相安倍晋三的被称为“A安倍经济学”的经济复苏战略的所谓的“第三支箭 ” 。	In fact, it still struggles with imbalances today, owing to its inability or unwillingness to embrace badly needed structural reforms – the so-called “third arrow” of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic recovery strategy, known as “Abenomics.”
他们宣称，涓滴经济学（trickle-down economics）最终将确保全体人口都获得经济收益。	Trickle-down economics, they claim, will ensure that, ultimately, the entire population benefits economically.
当然，他们只是表示了意向，并没有真正的付钱。 目前，每天都有新的用户注册登记，现在有1000人注册。	But the company’s Web site continues to attract new prospects, with 1,000 people now registered as likely or certain to buy such a vehicle.
首先，印度每年接收的汇款超过700亿美元，汇款金额为世界之最，在印度GDP中占比近4 % ， 超过了印度的教育支出。	For starters, India receives more than $70 billion in remittances every year, the largest sum worldwide, amounting to nearly 4% of its GDP, which is more than it spends on education.
比如，至2007年底，美联储和美国财政部极有可能已经见过至少一份宣称只有大规模干预支持次级贷款才能阻止灾难的发生的报告。	By late 2007, for example, the Fed and the US Treasury had most likely already seen at least one report arguing that only massive intervention to support subprime loans could forestall a catastrophe.
这样做需要更多地信息 — — 不是来自书本或研究文章，而是通过对习惯的了解以找到你个人对自由和自我控制这一永恒问题的答案。	The way to do that is with more information – not from books or learned articles, but through awareness of habits that can lead to finding one’s own answers to eternal questions about freedom and self-control.
当皮姆·弗杜恩决意在荷兰发起运动，抗拒穆斯林的影响，他的目标是捍卫性自由，而不是传统的基督教价值观。	When Pim Fortuyn in Holland decided to wage a campaign against Muslim influence, he was defending sexual freedom, not traditional Christian values.
我坚持认为他们对国际舆论的考虑-如果这种考虑如我所料地影响了他们的判决的话-也是为了国家利益而不是个人得失。	I contend that their concern for world opinion-if that concern played the role I am suggesting it did-was for their country, not for themselves.
德国总理安格拉·默克尔似乎是一位意识到美国领导力坍塌将以多快速度带来后1945年全球秩序终结的领袖。	German Chancellor Angela Merkel is one leader who seems to recognize how quickly the collapse of US leadership could bring about the end of the post-1945 global order.
欧盟委员会主席让-克劳德·容克（Jean-Claude Juncker）呼吁建立更强化的联邦制 — — 将更多的权力委托给欧盟管理机构。	European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for more federalism – for more power to be delegated to the EU’s governing institutions.
但如果中国和美国能就减少或消除双方扭曲的一揽子政策变化达成一项总体协议，那么可能更容易克服国内的抵制力量。	But if China and the US reach a grand bargain on a package of policy changes that would reduce or eliminate distortions on both sides, domestic resistance may be easier to overcome.
但常常需要等到旷日持久的政治和政策僵局已经到了不得不打破的程度 — — 并且常常造成高昂的代价，如群众暴力和生命损失。	But this typically happens only when an extended political and policy stalemate must be broken – and it often comes at a high cost in terms of public violence and loss of life.
在去年11月举行的华盛顿峰会上，欧盟提议了一个基本准则，即所有市场、所有区域与所有让全球金融体系陷入危险的行动人都应该被监视。	At the Washington Summit last November, the EU suggested a basic principle: all markets, all territories, and all actors putting the global financial system at risk should be monitored.
在逐渐滑向危机的前几年，收入不平等状况在许多国家进一步加剧，并对社会凝聚力带来了一些令人忧心的后果。	In the years leading up to the crisis, inequality rose in many countries, with worrisome consequences for social cohesion.
但从当下的危机中我们学到的教训是必须发展出一种全球经济治理的方式来管理、监管并遏制全球市场所释放出的创造性，但通常也是破坏性的力量。	But the lesson from the current crisis is that we will have to develop styles of global economic governance to manage, regulate, and mitigate the creative, but often disruptive forces unleashed by the global market.
我对常规凯恩斯主义观点表示赞同，即如果任何地方的经济出现放缓，就会降低世界总需求，从而对全球利率施加下行压力。	I appreciate the usual Keynesian thinking that if any economy anywhere slows, this lowers world aggregate demand, and therefore puts downward pressure on global interest rates.
克拉克每年能挣600万澳元，此外还有津贴 — — 每场国际测试赛都有14 000美元出场费费以及其他差旅费和奖金。	Clarke earns about $6 million (Australian dollars) per year; in addition to an annual retainer, he receives a $14,000 match fee for every international test match, along with other tour fees and bonuses.
这是隐藏在当前欧洲政策组合背后的理念，将财政紧缩与“结构性改革”相结合，减少构建社会安全网的支出，放宽那些保障劳动者权益的规定。	This is the thinking behind the current policy mix in Europe, where fiscal austerity is combined with “structural reform,” meaning less spending on the social safety net and less regulation to protect workers.
化学突触传导包括释放特定的分子 — — 散布于细胞间空间、与位于相邻神经元特定神经末梢互动的神经递质。	Chemical synaptic transmission involves the release of specific molecules, neurotransmitters, which diffuse through the intercellular space and interact with specific receptors located on an adjacent neuron.
葡萄牙不久前采取了进一步措施，投票确认消遣性质的吸毒，包括吸食海洛因和可卡因不属于刑事犯罪。 这项举措已使因吸毒造成的死亡人数大幅度降低，减少了新增艾滋病感染病例。	Portugal recently went a step further in voting to decriminalize recreational drugs, including heroin and cocaine – a move that has led to a significant decline in drug-related deaths and a fall in new HIV infections.
但是，正当世界强国的财政部长和中央银行行长本月聚会华盛顿参加半年一度的国际货币基金组织董事会会议之时，政策瘫痪还在延续。	Yet, as the world’s leading finance ministers and central bankers convene in Washington this month for the semi-annual International Monetary Fund board meetings, policy paralysis continues.
这些疾病不仅包括 HIV，还包括肺结核，光去年死亡人数就达到了32,000。 此外，其教育标准也在严重下滑。	It heads the list on the spread of preventable diseases – not only HIV, but tuberculosis, with 32,000 deaths last year alone – and its education standards are in severe decline.
当2001年孟加拉国总理卡莉达·齐亚（Begum Khaleda Zia ） — —遇刺的军事铁腕人物齐亚将军的遗孀，用“阿拉的主权”取代了宪法中的宗教和世俗分离的世俗主义，那个改变由此开端。	That began to change in 2001, when Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of the assassinated military strongman General Zia, replaced secularism in the Constitution with the “Sovereignty of Allah.”
更糟糕的是，由于出口拉动型复苏产生的收入变少 — — 出口可获得增值税退税，但进口需要交纳增值税 — — 貌似坚挺的政府财务状况很快便演变为巨额赤字。	Making matters worse, because an export-led recovery yields less revenue – value-added taxes are rebated on exports, but collected on imports – seemingly strong government finances quickly turned into large deficits.
在特拉亚罗纳遭到处决后，政府甚至在推特上发表了一张时任总统伊恩·卡马的照片，并配以“死刑符合国家利益”的标题说明。	After Tselayarona was executed, the government even tweeted a photo of then-President Ian Khama under a caption that read, “Death penalty serves nation well.”
这种做法曾经在东南亚和拉美缔造出强大的共产主义和反美民族主义联盟，同样的做法如今又使中东地区产生了极端伊斯兰主义和反美民族主义的联合运动。	Just as it produced a potent fusion of communism and anti-American nationalism in Southeast Asia and Latin America, it is now producing a similar combination of radical Islam and anti-American nationalism across the Middle East.
出资者将所谓的“捐助金内 ” （ in-donor）难民成本记录为ODA所依据的规则是经合组织-DAC统计报告条例在1988年制定的。	The rule enabling donors to report so-called “in-donor” refugee costs as ODA was introduced in the OECD-DAC Statistical Reporting Directives back in 1988.
但在荷兰、伦敦或湄公河三角洲，并没有人需要通过水肺设备来四处走动，因为那里的人们，早已对提供防洪保护的基础设施非常适应了。	But nobody in Holland, London, or the Mekong River Delta needs scuba gear to get around, because humanity has adapted with infrastructure that provides flood protection.
左转团体有一个帮助人们找到距离最近的国会摇摆区的非常有用的网站 — — 其意义在于确定民主党人应当在哪里集中投入他们的精力和捐款。	The group Swing Left has a helpful website that enables people to find the nearest congressional swing district – the point being to identify where Democrats should focus their attention and donations.
虽然对从中美洲取道墨西哥前往美国的移民大篷车多有讨论，但与中国、伊朗，朝鲜甚至俄罗斯的贸易以及网络暗战等事务都没有得到太多关注。	While much was made of the migrant caravan making its way from Central America through Mexico, issues such as trade with China, Iran, North Korea, and even Russia and cyber subterfuge didn’t get much traction.
当然，菲德尔司令步下权坛将完全是一桩生物学事件。 自他去年病倒后所公布的数张照片表明了生物学的作用。	Commandante Fidel’s departure from power, of course, will be solely a matter of biology, and the few pictures of him that have emerged since he took ill last year clearly show biology at work.
一项有趣的2014年研究发现，即使参与者表示他们想看积极报道，但他们的行为揭示他们更喜欢消极内容（他们并没有意识到这一篇好 ） 。	An intriguing 2014 study found that even when participants stated that they wanted to read positive stories, their behavior revealed a preference for negative content (a preference they didn’t even realize).
有几位颇具影响的瑞典学界和政界精英不仅没有将严厉批评的矛头指向审查制度的鼓吹者和暴力煽动者，反而不约而同地将矛头对准了威尔克斯。	A number of influential Swedish intellectuals and politicians have directed their harshest criticism against Vilks, not against those who have called for censorship and even incited violence.
但IMF的优雅的妥协将给希腊带来巨大的债务积压；要想降低债务，欧洲必须找到办法暂时将国家政治抛在一边，根据经济逻辑和必要性采取行动。	But the Fund’s elegant compromise still leaves Greece under the shadow of an enormous debt overhang; reducing it requires that Europe find a way to set aside national politics and act on the basis of economic logic and necessity.
出乎所有人的预料，英国提出可以放弃部分财政优惠，从而在道义上赢得了主动。 但兑现承诺的条件是欧盟其它国家（比如法国）同意对欧盟农业政策进行根本的改革。	Against all expectations, it struck a morally advantageous posture by offering to surrender some part of its budget rebate, but only if the rest of the European Union (i.e. France, in particular) would agree to fundamental reforms of EU farm policy.
问题是这些测试必须由受过训练的神经心理学家进行，需要一个多小时时间完成；此外，许多有温和认知损伤的人并不会出现痴呆。	The problem is that the tests must be administered by a trained neuropsychologist and take more than an hour to complete; moreover, many people with mild cognitive impairment do not progress to dementia.
幸运的是，现在我们知道我们能够阻止灾难性气候变化而不妨碍提供保持经济增长、就业创造和让数百万人脱贫所需要的能源。	Fortunately, we now know that we can prevent catastrophic climate change while still providing the energy needed to sustain economic growth, create jobs, and lift millions of people out of poverty.
高层政治和折磨人的技术细节使欧盟决策远远不如各成员国本国政治景象有趣，当然还加上另一个问 题，即如此多的议员都是不为人知的外国人。	The combination of high politics and grinding technical detail makes EU policymaking a much less interesting spectacle than national politics, and of course there’s the added problem that so many of the players are unknown foreigners.
梅还需要补偿保守党在伦敦所辖自治市肯星顿（Kensington）所犯的错误 — — 上周肯星顿格伦菲尔大楼（Grenfell Tower）发生大火，至少30人丧生，并且人数可能还会继续上升。	May will also need to atone for the sins of the Tories in the London borough of Kensington with regard to last week’s Grenfell Tower fire, in which at least 30 people, and perhaps many more, lost their lives.
在两次大战期间（1919—1939年 ） ， 美国人还没有做好承担责任的准备；但二战让他们领略了孤立主义的代价，1944年，他们终于迎难而上。	During the interwar period (1919-1939), Americans were unprepared to assume that mantle; but World War II taught them the cost of isolationism, and they rose to the challenge in 1944.
投资者们之所以来到这里，就是因为他们把爱尔兰的欧元区成员国地位和我国的长期经济稳定以及在有需要的情况下获取外界支持的渠道联系在了一起。	Investors come here because they link Ireland’s eurozone membership to our long-term economic stability and access to outside support if necessary.
这种基于相互认同和忍耐的体系通过所谓的《蓬托菲霍协定》于1958年在委内瑞拉正式固定下来，并在遭到查韦斯谴责和摧毁之前使该国的民主体制稳定运行了40年。	Such a system, based on mutual recognition and forbearance, was formalized in Venezuela in 1958, through what was known as the Punto Fijo Pact, which stabilized democracy for 40 years, before Chávez denounced and destroyed it.
所以，也难怪在过去的400年中唐吉诃德和潘沙繁衍出了许多亲戚或后代，包括无数对老大-仆人的小丑组合。	It is no surprise, then, that for the last 400 years Don Quixote and Panza have bred many relatives and successors, including countless buffoonish boss-and-servant couples.
从2001到2011，中国占韩国出口份额从12%增加了一倍，至24 % ； 占日本出口份额的增长则更快，从8%上升到20 % 。	From 2001 to 2011, China’s share of South Korean exports doubled, from 12% to 24%; its share of Japanese exports grew even faster, rising from 8% to 20%.
波兰，斯洛伐克，白俄罗斯和乌克兰 — — 以及这些国家的1亿人口 — — 将被剥夺掉一项收入的重要来源，这将在经济上削弱它们，使它们更容易受克里姆林宫摆布。	Poland, Slovakia, Belarus, and Ukraine – with their 100 million people – will be stripped of an important source of revenue, which will weaken them economically and make them more vulnerable to Kremlin pressure.
以作为各央行储备货币的国际使用以及作为外汇市场载体的标准看，美元坠落速度最快的阶段是1978—1991年和2001—2010年。	By the criteria of international use as a reserve currency among central banks and as a vehicle in foreign-exchange markets, the most rapid declines took place from 1978 to 1991 and from 2001 to 2010.
然而随着全球工业生产指数自2013年下半年以来持续攀升，尤其体现出发达经济体状况的好转，因此对商品市场的悲观预期似乎也不靠谱。	However, with global industrial-production indicators climbing since the second half of 2013, pointing especially to improvements in the advanced economies, gloomy forecasts for commodity markets seem off the mark.
中国可以以多种方式来鼓励创新，包括构建研发集群并通过加强知识产权保护以及改革企业市场化流程来鼓励发明创造。	China can support innovation in many ways, including by developing research-and-development clusters and helping inventors reap rewards through stronger intellectual property protection and reforms to the process of bringing firms to market.

无论沙赫扎德还是曾在2009年试图在航班上引爆炸药的尼日利亚“内衣炸弹”袭击者奥马尔·法鲁克·阿卜杜勒 - 穆塔拉都是工程学研究者。	Both Shahzad and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian “Underwear Bomber” who attempted to detonate explosives on a flight in 2009, studied engineering.
但女孩的支持者 — — 不论是政府、非政府组织还是发展和融资机构 — — 都在为了满足这些需要而奔波。	But girls’ advocates – in governments, non-governmental organizations, and development and funding agencies – struggle daily with meeting these needs.
几乎所有人都预期，如果美国利率开始升高，美元将升值，特别是因为欧盟和日本将继续实施宽松货币环境多个月甚至多年。	The dollar is almost universally expected to appreciate when US interest rates start rising, especially because the EU and Japan will continue easing monetary conditions for many months, even years.
仅仅四分之一个世纪之前，关于经济制度的争论 — — 国家管理的社会主义还是自由民主和资本主义 — — 似乎已经尘埃落定。	Just a quarter-century ago, the debate about economic systems – state-managed socialism or liberal democracy and capitalism – seemed to have been settled.
布宜诺斯艾利斯 — — 众所周知，美国共和党总统尼克松曾于1971年公开表示“现在我们都是凯恩斯主义者 。 ”	BUENOS AIRES – “We are all Keynesians now,” Republican US President Richard Nixon famously said in 1971.
盖茨基金已经明智地开始推进向主要科学家就加快强有力的新诊疗手段的研发进行的咨询活动，并且已经资助了一种疫苗，新药品以及新诊断技术的研发。	The Gates Foundation has sensibly begun to facilitate consultations with leading scientists on accelerating the development of potent new tools, and is already funding the development of a vaccine, as well as new drugs and diagnostics.
疫苗是性价比最高的预防儿童疾病的干预手段，最常见的细菌性肺炎（肺炎双球菌和乙型流感嗜血杆菌）以及腹泻（轮状病毒）疫苗早已面世。	Vaccines represent the most cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood illness, and they already exist for most common bacterial causes of pneumonia (pneumococcus and Hib) and for the leading causes of diarrhea (rotavirus).
如果他们失败 — — 如我们已经看到的 — — 那么其他人就会趁虚而入，可能打着救世主的未来的旗号行残暴之实。	If they fail, as we have seen, others will fill the void, potentially with a call for mayhem in the name of messianic futurity.
发自纽约 — — 其实早已有众多因素促成了今日中东的乱局：长达数十年的腐败与专制，教育程度不断提高且经由网络串联起来的社会，以及飙升的全球食品价格。	NEW YORK – Many factors underlay the ongoing upheavals in the Middle East: decades of corrupt and authoritarian rule, increasingly literate and digitally-connected societies, and skyrocketing world food prices.
习近平在9月22日的西雅图演讲中强调，中国和美国需要深化“相互理解战���意图 ” ， 这是双边关系的关键目标。	Speaking in Seattle on September 22, Xi stressed the need for both the US and China to deepen their “mutual understanding of strategic intentions” as a key objective for the bilateral relationship.
当然，由于中国人口比美国多四倍多，其12,900美元的人均GDP仍不足美国的54,700美元，这表明美国的生活水平比中国高得多。	Of course, because China’s population is more than four times larger, its per capita GDP, at $12,900, is still less than a quarter of the $54,700 recorded in the US, which highlights America’s much higher living standards.
至于如何防止不作为，决策者必须充分利用所有工具和手段优势，包括立法、报告指引、税收、激励和公共教育。	Policymakers must take advantage of the full range of tools available to them, including legislation, reporting guidelines, taxes, incentives, and public education about the costs of inaction.
这不但等于打了东南亚联盟主席国印尼一个耳光，也是对东南亚联盟本身的当头一棒，尤其是当该组织正寻求在2015年组成东南亚共同体的���候。	It was a blow not only to Indonesia as the chair of Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year, but also to ASEAN itself, particularly given the organization’s quest to become an ASEAN Community by 2015.
粮食成本巨幅上升已经在贫穷人口中造成更大的饥荒，降低了非贫穷人口的购买力以及三十多个国家中的因粮食引发的骚乱。	The skyrocketing cost of food has resulted in more starvation among the poor, reduced purchasing power among the non-poor, and food riots in more than 30 countries.
非包容性增长的溢出效应几乎随处可见，如社会极化、政策僵局和不连贯、普遍的公共信任缺失等，只是程度不同罢了。	The spillover effects of non-inclusive growth are already evident almost everywhere, to varying degrees, in the form of social polarization, policy gridlock and incoherence, and a generalized loss of public trust.
克莱蒙特，加利福尼亚州—最近，中国举行了一系列鲜为外界关注的高规格隆重仪式纪念前领导人邓小平110年诞辰。	CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – China has recently held a series of solemn, high-profile ceremonies, barely noticed by the outside world, in honor of the 110th anniversary of former leader Deng Xiaoping’s birth.
奥巴马变被动为主动，不再只是一味可堪怀疑的候选人，而是一位值得信任的总统，东部受灾人民眼睁睁地盼着他来救自己。	Obama swung into action, now not just a suspect candidate but a trusted president whose services were sorely needed by the battered population of the East Coast.
愤世嫉俗者认为这不过是用来推卸责任的言论，只是由于另外两个战争借口都已经土崩瓦解，它才开始被世界所关注。	Cynics view this as merely an argument of convenience, one that has gained in prominence only because the other two rationales for the war collapsed.
在确保风险管理的种种努力能增强安全，加强国际协作以确保非恶意使用科学进步方面，国际科学界将发挥重要作用。	The international scientific community has a key role to play in ensuring that efforts to manage the risks improve security and strengthen international collaboration to ensure non- maleficent use of scientific advances.
在1963年，底层90%的人口需要让其财富增加六倍后才能成为中间阶层的9.9 % ； 但到了2010年，从底层90%跳到中间阶层9.9 % ， 他们需要让财富增加25倍。	In 1963, the 90% would have had to increase their wealth sixfold to reach the level of the 9.9%; by the 2010s, they would need 25 times their wealth to reach that level.
纵观其历史，由于印度和中国的文明被广阔的青藏高原隔开，相互之间的文化和宗教互动因而受到了限制；而两国之间几乎不存在政治关系。	Throughout their histories, the Indian and Chinese civilizations were separated by the vast Tibetan plateau, limiting their interaction to sporadic cultural and religious contacts; political relations were absent.
此外他还为支持阿萨德政权的外部力量 — — 尤其是派出地面作战训练人员和军机来为阿萨德助战的俄罗斯 — — 留出了干预冲突的空间。	Moreover, he left space for external powers that support Assad – especially Russia, which has sent trainers and strike aircraft to help Assad’s forces – to intervene in the conflict.
有效经济平台的第四个板块是金融监管，这正是共和党在一个特别糟糕的时刻 — — 金融和商业周期的高峰 — — 所尝试削弱的。	The fourth plank of an effective economic platform is financial regulation, which Republicans are weakening at a particularly bad moment: the peak of the financial and business cycles.
事实上，即使是在宪法条约下，所有国家都知道，他们的伙伴拥有明确的撤退的权力，只要他们足够地清醒或把建立欧盟看作是一个坏主意。	Indeed, even under the Constitutional Treaty, all states know that their partners have the express right to withdraw if they should ever become sufficiently disenchanted or come to look upon the EU as a bad bargain.
而这场危机同时也危及到非欧洲国家，人们对美国银行和货币市场基金与受灾欧洲银行之间的牵涉情况感到忧虑，进而危害到了美国金融市场。	The crisis affects non-Europeans too; for example, concern over the exposure of American banks and money-market funds to troubled European banks is harming US financial markets.
但要想取得成功 ， “ 新绿色协议”必须解决发展中国家的某些重大挑战，全球变暖的后果在发展中国家最先被感知到，而且也最显著，因为经济的快速发展需要大规模扩张廉价能源。	But, to be successful, a “green new deal” will have to address some enormous challenges in the developing world, where the impact of global warming will be felt first and hardest, and where rapid growth requires massive expansion of cheap energy.
但美国也在付出沉重代价：其他国家，哪怕是海地和厄瓜多尔等贫穷的发展中国家，都已经学会了如何更好地管理自然灾害（常常要在为某个巨灾付出巨大代价之后 ） 。	But America is paying a high price as well: other countries, even poor developing countries, like Haiti and Ecuador, seem to have learned (often at great expense and only after some huge calamities) how to manage natural disasters better.
大量分析家，包括哈佛大学的史蒂芬·沃尔特（Stephen M. Walt ） ， 都指出这样的言论完全是无稽之谈，极尽夸张之能事。	Countless analysts, such as Stephen M. Walt of Harvard University, have shown these claims to be completely unfounded and hyperbolic in the extreme.
1982年未遂政变后，许多小报纸被国家关闭，1988—1990年间，至少有20家报纸被迫永久停止发行。	After an attempted coup in 1982, many smaller newspapers were shut down by the state, and between 1988 and 1990, at least 20 newspapers were forced to cease publication permanently.
但最重要的两个亚洲盟友之间的肆无忌惮的中伤阻碍了实现美国的主要目标 — — 包括确保其在该地区持久的长期军事存在 — — 所必须的实质合作。	But the relentless sniping by its two most important Asian allies has blocked the kind of concrete cooperation needed to help it achieve its main goals, including ensuring a durable, long-term military presence in the region.
“我们将进一步确保他们以反疫苗鼓吹者的面目出现 ， ” 新南威尔士州公平贸易部长斯图尔特·埃尔斯（Stuart Ayres）说 ， “ 我们希望确保他们不再传播误导性信息 。 ”	“We will continue to ensure that they present themselves as an anti-vaccination advocacy,” said New South Wales Fair Trading Minister Stuart Ayres. “We want to make sure that they don’t ever promote misleading information.”
实现自动化、脱媒化和降低远程成本的信息技术同样使建设越来越复杂、地缘上越来越多样的全球供应链和网络成为可能。	The same class of information technologies that automate, disintermediate, and reduce the costs of remoteness are also enabling the construction of increasingly complex and geographically diverse global supply chains and networks.
由七名法官组成的欧洲人权法院审议庭根据这一假设并考虑到所要解决的案件于2006年2月作出了原告败诉的裁决，并且判定，有关特殊学校的法律并不是特别针对罗姆人的，并且不是仅仅适用于他们的。	Working on this assumption and given the case it had to solve, an EHCR panel of seven judges ruled against the plaintiffs in February 2006, concluding that the law on special schools is not aimed specifically at Roma and does not apply only to them.
但缺乏自由派候选人无法解释为何普京在莫斯科赢得70%的选票，在圣彼得堡赢得75%的选票（投票率比全国平均水平低15 % ） 。	And yet the absence of liberal candidates does not explain why Putin won 70% of the vote in Moscow and 75% in St. Petersburg (where the turnout was 15% less than the national average).
伯克利—在整个欧洲-大西洋地区，2008—2009年衰退后的复苏一直步履蹒跚，将本可治愈的周期性失业拖成了结构性失业。	BERKELEY – Across the Euro-Atlantic world, recovery from the recession of 2008-2009 remains sluggish and halting, turning what was readily curable cyclical unemployment into structural unemployment.
为了满足选民，特朗普必须找出办法再分配力量，这种再分配的方法要超越收入而不只是收入本身，也不只通过税收和支出手段。	To satisfy his voters, Trump must find ways to redistribute power over income, not just income itself, and not just by taxing and spending.
从本质上说，这也正是潘基文对联合国成员国们所要说的话：让我们清晰地定义可持续发展目标，从而启发全世界公民、企业、政府、科学家和公民社会朝这些目标努力。	This is, in essence, Ban’s message to the UN member states: Let us define the SDGs clearly, and thereby inspire citizens, businesses, governments, scientists, and civil society around the world to move toward them.
但卡尔森总是悄悄地说，这也许是他在艾奥瓦州的的支持率高于其他共和党竞争者（在一项民调中与特朗普打了平手）的原因。	But Carson says them quietly, which may be why his favorability rating in Iowa is higher than that of his Republican competitors (pulling even with Trump in one poll).
作为在抗击HIV领域有10余年经验的非洲活动家，我希望世卫组织能在迈出建议使用PrEP这关键一步的基础上更上一层楼。	As an African activist with more than ten years of experience in the fight against HIV, I hope that the WHO will build on its important first step of advising the use of PrEP.
事实上，对他们而言，冲突终归象征不公正殖民秩序的时代错误永存，代表其政治抑郁，并且显示其绝无可能主宰自己的命运。	In reality, for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order, to represent their political malaise, and to embody the perceived impossibility of their being masters of their destiny.
但最近，超强厄尔尼诺让最新经济学研究纷纷开始反思这一观点。 厄尔尼诺是一种复杂的全球气候事件，其标志是厄瓜多尔和秘鲁太平洋沿岸海水特别温暖。	But recent economic research, bolstered by an exceptionally strong El Niño – a complex global climactic event marked by exceptionally warm Pacific Ocean water off the coast of Ecuador and Peru – has prompted a rethink of this view.

德国公众对于财政廉洁（fiscal probity）怀着牢不可破的支持，任何其他建议都不啻政治自杀。	Given the German public’s deep-rooted sentiment in favor of fiscal probity, anything else would have been politically self-defeating.
如果货币波动是经济波动的主因，并且你可以保证正确数量的货币支持正常的商业活动，那么就没有必要进行政府干预。	If monetary fluctuations are the main cause of economic fluctuations, and if one can ensure the right quantity of money to support normal business activity, there will be no need for government interference.
其他发达经济体或新兴市场（欧元区除G7外的其他国家；新西兰，冰岛，爱沙尼亚，拉脱维亚以及一些欧洲东南部经济体）也在进入衰退的硬着陆。	Other advanced economies or emerging markets (the rest of the euro zone; New Zealand, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, and some Southeast European economies) are also nearing a recessionary hard landing.
伦敦T5每小时包裹处理能力可达12，000件（如果T5还能够处理包裹的话 ） ， 每年旅客吞吐量可达3000万人，而北京T3每小时包裹处理能力达到20，000件，旅客吞吐能力达到5000万人。	Whereas T5 can handle only 12,000 bags an hour (when it handles them at all) and 30 million passengers per year, T3 can handle 20,000 bags an hour and 50 million passengers.
普京不仅为亚努科维奇提供庇护，而且拒绝承认基辅新政府；他开始协助组织 — — 和煽动 — — 克里米亚主要民族俄罗斯族的抵抗运动。	For his part, Putin not only provided sanctuary for Yanukovych and refused to recognize the new government in Kyiv; he began to help organize – and incite – resistance among Crimea’s ethnic Russian majority.
就威胁国际和平和安全的问题投票是安理会的常规工作，但是这个办法等于让一小撮国家来决定整个地球的命运。	The Security Council normally votes on issues that threaten international peace and security, but this method would allow only a small number of governments to decide Earth’s fate.
核心问题在于知识是一种（全球性）公共产品，一方面在技术意义上其使用者的边际成本为零，另一方面更普遍的意义在于知识的增加可以改善全球的福祉。	The central problem is that knowledge is a (global) public good, both in the technical sense that the marginal cost of someone using it is zero, and in the more general sense that an increase in knowledge can improve wellbeing globally.
在这一背景下，中国利用其不断增长的全球影响力引导新经济秩序 — — 一个美元不再拥有霸主地位的秩序 — — 不足为奇。	Against this backdrop, it is hardly surprising that China has been using its growing global influence to help engineer a new economic order – one in which the US dollar does not reign supreme.
1995年发动宫廷政变罢黜其父后，阿勒萨尼冷不防需要面对充满敌意的沙特阿拉伯和埃及，那些精英更喜欢他胆小怯懦的父亲，而鄙视这位雄心勃勃的年轻统治者。	After deposing his father in a palace coup in 1995, Al Thani was suddenly confronted with a hostile Saudi Arabia and Egypt, whose elites despised the ambitious young ruler and preferred his more timid father.
伊拉克有可能成为第一个什叶派穆斯林统治的阿拉伯国家，进而融入到不断扩张中的伊朗什叶派帝国之中。 在这种情况下，美国在该地区的逊尼派盟国现在认为美国是不可靠的。	With Iraq probably becoming the first Arab country to be ruled by Shiites, and hence integrated into an expanding Shiite Iranian empire, America’s Sunni allies in the region now view the US as unreliable.
就我所听到（或听说）的美国CEO的演讲而言，没有一个人提到美国总统特朗普（他也出参加了年会）的偏执 、 “ 直男癌”和种族主义。	Not one of the US CEOs whose speech I heard (or heard about) mentioned the bigotry, misogyny, or racism of US President Donald Trump, who was present at the event.
英国经济学家凯恩斯担心，如果人们不把英镑看作可靠的价值储备，那么，各国就不会用英镑来结算各自的交易结余。	The British economist John Maynard Keynes worried that countries would not use sterling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value.
当然，从长期看，新兴市场将从利率正常化中获益，因为它们不再需要面对导致不可持续增长路径的扭曲和失衡。	In the long run, of course, emerging markets will benefit from interest-rate normalization, because they will no longer suffer the distortions and imbalances that lead to unsustainable growth patterns.
在此引用一位年轻的英国穆斯林穆罕默德·斯迪克·翰（他参加了伦敦地铁爆炸案，操一口浓重的约克郡口音）的话语 ： “ （我这样做）是为我死去的穆斯林兄弟姐妹报仇 。 ”	As the young Muslim Briton Mohammed Sidique Khan put it (speaking in a heavy Yorkshire accent), he participated in the London Underground bombings “to avenge my Muslim brothers and sisters.”
但是，尽管许多人可能否认，但低技能劳动力供给的增加导致了均衡工资的降低 — — 只要需求曲线是正常的向下倾斜形状。	And yet, while many might deny it, an increase in the supply of low-skill labor leads – so long as there are normal downward-sloping demand curves – to lower equilibrium wages.
发展中国家饥饿人口的比例已显著下降 - 从1990-1992年的23.2％降至目前的14.9 ％ 。	The proportion of hungry people in developing countries has declined significantly – from 23.2% in 1990-92 to 14.9% today.
九国领导人还同意快速扩张TPP，考虑向其他成员开放 — — 其中最重要的便是最近才接受太平洋地区自由贸易协定思想的日本。	These leaders also agreed to fast-track the TPP initiative, and to consider opening it to other members – most importantly Japan, a late convert to the idea of a Pacific region free-trade agreement.
因此我们将会一直自在“未充分就业均衡”之下，除非英国和欧元区国家的政策发生改变（前提是美国的政策不会变得更糟糕 ） 。	So we will remain in a state of “under-employment equilibrium” until policy in the UK and the eurozone is changed (and assuming that policy in the US does not become worse).
如今，德国人必须扪心自问：作为从欧洲一体化中受益最大的群体，他们是愿意为此出点血，还是宁愿坐视欧洲一体化夭折？	Germans must now ask themselves whether they, who have profited the most from European integration, are willing to pay the price for it or would prefer to let it fail.
在比赛之前，裁判（同时也是神道教神职人员）在平台四角撒上海藻，盐和沙子来“净化”场地，相扑手则必须在上场之前沐浴更衣，洗净污秽，而中圈以内的沙子也是神圣之物，不能被鞋子和妇女所玷污的。	Before a match, referees (who double as Shinto priests) purify the seaweed, salt, and sake. Wrestlers wash their faces, mouths, and armpits before entering the dohyo (ring), on whose sacred sand neither shoes nor women may tread.
一个由财阀组成的政府 — — 大部分成员通过寻租活动，而不是生产性的企业家精神，攫取大量财富 — — 必然会大肆奖励自己。	An administration of plutocrats – most of whom gained their wealth from rent-seeking activities, rather than from productive entrepreneurship – could be expected to reward themselves.
不论关于贿赂、回扣、选举操纵和其他不法行为的流言和报道如何日嚣尘上，国际足联主席“赛普”约瑟夫·布拉特（Joseph “Sepp” Blatter）及其同僚和相关人士总是可以逍遥法外。	Whatever rumors flew or reports were made on bribes, kickbacks, vote-rigging, and other dodgy practices, FIFA President Joseph “Sepp” Blatter and his colleagues and associates always seemed to emerge without a scratch.
但美国永远无法从其担任总统时的卑劣、颟顸和面对中国的全球野心的令人迷惑的消极态度对美国文化和国际地位所造成的伤口中完全恢复。	But America will never recover completely from the unstanchable wound that his presidency’s baseness, bull-headed stupidity, and puzzling passivity in the face of China’s global ambitions has inflicted on its culture and international standing.
但是，在加入世贸组织十多年后，外资银行占中国市场的份额只有 2 % — — 这表明中国还需要改进准入、开放及公平竞争环境。	But, more than a decade after China’s accession to the World Trade Organization, foreign banks’ share of the Chinese market stands at a miniscule 2% – a reflection of Chinese regulators’ failure to create a level playing field.
英法协议并不影响两国对北约的承诺，须知作为美国的一项核心利益，任何驻外欧洲部队的削减都不可避免地意味着美国更沉重的财政负担。	The Franco-British treaties do not address commitments to NATO, a key US interest, because any reduction in the number of European troops deployed abroad inevitably implies a greater economic burden for the US.
该指数的下降主要是对当前经济形势更不利的评估的结果，但是它也被反映在对未来六个月经济预期的向下修正上。	That decline was primarily the result of more unfavorable appraisals of the current economic situation, but also reflected another downward revision of expectations for the next six months.
不幸的是，对未来赤字的新出现的自鸣得意之情让实施开启美国长期预算赤字整合过程所需要的立法变得十分困难（如果不是不可能的话 ） 。	Unfortunately, the new complacency about future deficits makes it difficult, if not impossible, to enact the legislation needed to begin the process of trimming America’s long-term fiscal deficit.
在和平解决1962年古巴导弹危机的协议中，美国从土耳其撤出了核弹头，而约翰·肯尼迪对公众隐瞒了这一点。	John F. Kennedy misled the public about the withdrawal of US nuclear warheads from Turkey in the deal that peacefully ended the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.
多年来，日本实体经济一直依靠高达GDP的6%的财政赤字，以及由日本银行行长黑田东彦于2013年4月开始实施的巨量量化宽松（QE）的支撑。	Japan’s real economy has been supported for years by fiscal deficits as high as 6% of GDP, and by extraordinary quantitative easing (QE), which BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda introduced in April 2013.
人口增长大概可以持续到本世纪中叶（拜寿命延长所赐 ） ， 但就新人替旧人而言，人类规模将不会再扩张了。	Population may keep growing until mid-century, owing to rising longevity, but, reproductively speaking, our species should no longer be expanding.
俄罗斯不再是超级大国，这个拥有1.45亿人口的国家经济依赖油气价格，也不再向世界传播政治领域的意识形态。	Russia is no longer a superpower, but rather a country of some 145 million people with an economy dependent on the price of oil and gas and no political ideology to offer the world.
历史也驳斥了芝加哥大学经济学家亨利·西蒙（Henry Simon）所呼吁的货币政策“规则而不是当局 ” 。	History has refuted the University of Chicago economist Henry Simons’s call for “rules rather than authorities” in monetary policy.
在阿富汗内战的背景下，奥萨马·本·拉登在塔利班统治下的阿富汗创建了恐怖组织 — — “基地组织 ” 。 该组织于2001年9月11日对美国发动了骇人听闻的恐怖袭击。	In the shadow of this second Afghan war, Osama bin Laden established his terrorist organization in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan: Al Qaeda, which, on September 11, 2001, carried out its terrible terrorist attack on the US.
正是由于有近期重建波斯尼亚、哥伦比亚以及其他遭受战争蹂躏的国家的不同经历，人们现在对斯里兰卡要做的包括重建措施的先后顺序在内的事情，有了更好的理解。	Some of what needs to be done, including the sequencing of reconstruction measures, is now better understood – not least due to the different recent experiences in rebuilding Bosnia, Colombia, and other war-torn states.
据报道，寨卡疫区婴儿小头症（一种出生缺陷）概率飙升让巴西、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔和萨尔瓦多政府警告女性公民“不要怀孕 ” 。	The reported spike in cases of microcephaly – a birth defect – among infants in Zika-affected areas led the governments of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and El Salvador to warn their female citizens “not to become pregnant.”
不仅如此，由于政府出台了大规模财政刺激政策以及部分私人亏损被全民分摊，目前出现了大规模的公共部门重建高杠杆的现象。	By contrast, as a consequence of fiscal stimulus and socialization of part of the private sector’s losses, there is now a massive re-leveraging of the public sector.
与此同时，尽量减少美国在世界银行的作用将导致中国 — — 这个特朗普的心腹大患 — — 乘虚而入，后者要么直接扩大在世界银行内部的势力，要么通过由其牵头组建的亚洲基础设施投资银行来笼络人心。	At the same time, minimizing the role of the US in the World Bank would create a vacuum to be filled by China, Trump’s bête noire, both in that institution and through the activities of the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
组团伊始时，这类质疑在金砖国家内部也存在，有人对金砖国家嗤之以鼻，认为它只是某家投资银行发明出来的国际组织。	Such skepticism has been leveled at the BRICS grouping itself from its inception, with some dismissing it as the only international organization invented by an investment bank.
除了这些人口监测功能之外，该登记系统还能使个人健康服务提供者和病人同时了解糖化血红蛋白的升降情况，进而对病人治疗方案提供支持。	Beyond these population-based surveillance functions, the registry was able to support patient care by ensuring that individual health-care providers and patients were made aware of elevated or rising HbA1c levels.
在当今的美国，这条皮带对肚皮来说已经足够松了 … … 但决定因素并不是货币的数量，而是支出的数额 。 ”	In the United States today, the belt is plenty big enough for the belly….It is [not] the quantity of money, [but] the volume of expenditure which is the operative factor.”
克莱蒙特，加利福尼亚—中国国家主席习近平在西雅图开始了访美之旅。 西雅图是许多世界领先的科技公司的总部所在地。	CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his trip to the United States in Seattle, home to many of the world’s leading technology firms, most observers are looking ahead to his subsequent meeting with President Barack Obama.
但是，确定同盟国战后对日领土疆界的基本立场的1943年开罗宣言中规定，日本必须强迫归还所有通过暴力占领的领土。	However, the 1943 Cairo Declaration, which stipulated the Allied Powers’ basic position on Japan’s territorial boundaries after WWII, stated that Japan would be expelled from all territories that it had annexed through violence.
他在1991年发表的货币政策论文被广泛引用，其中开创性地提出了要避免出现设定极低的通胀目标，以便在某种程度上给中央银行创造降低利率的空间。	His 1991 paper on monetary policy is widely cited as among the first to make the case for avoiding very low inflation targets, in part to give the central bank more room to lower interest rates.
但意大利这个在贝卢斯科尼骑士治国之下让人绝望的国家已经转变成现实乐观之源 — — 尽管这种乐观并不牢靠。	But Italy, a country that under Silvio’s Berlusconi’s cavalier rule was a source of despair, has turned into a source of real, if fragile, optimism.
最后，对伊朗进行军事打击也将标志着一场地区性并且可能是全球性军事和恐怖活动升级与扩大的开始，这对有关各方来说都不啻是一场可怕的梦魇。	Finally, a military attack on Iran would also mark the beginning of a regional, and possibly global, military and terrorist escalation – a nightmare for all concerned.
此外，那些不再享有医疗补助的人，也不会失去许多现在就因为医疗补助计划所允许的收费过低而拒绝接诊医疗补助患者的医生的服务。	Moreover, those who are no longer in the Medicaid program do not lose care from the many doctors who now refuse to serve Medicaid patients because of the low fees allowed in the program.
当2008年日本第一三共株式会社一掷46亿美元拿下了印度兰伯西制药集团的控制权之时，该公司显然是为自身未来的发展下了一笔赌注。	When the Japanese company Daiichi Sankyo paid $4.6 billion for majority control of the Ranbury pharmaceutical group in 2008, they were placing a bet on continuing corporate success.
当然，降低收入和权力不平等的经济和政治改革对于我们自身的命运和做出可信的共同牺牲诉求来说都是不可或缺的。	Of course economic and political reforms that reduce inequality of income and power are indispensable, both for their own sake and to make appeals to shared sacrifice credible.
如果一个国家投票决定2加2应该等于5，那么无论投赞成票的比例有多大或者“人民的呼声”有多响亮，这个“民主决定”最终都将服从于算术规则。	If a country votes to make two plus two equal five, this “democratic decision” will eventually be overridden by the rules of arithmetic, no matter how large the majority or how loudly “The People have spoken.”
同时美国对中国的态度也发生了巨大变化，过去那种认定必须与中国合作去管理全球需​​求的意识已经被保护主义和敌对情绪所取代。	The attitude toward China has also changed dramatically. Recognition that cooperation with China was necessary to manage global demand has given way to protectionism and hostility.
金正恩认为一旦没有了核武器，他就会跟其他那些放弃追求核武器的领导人 — — 比如伊拉克的萨达姆和利比亚的卡扎菲 — — 是一个下场了。	Without them, Kim believes, he would share the fate of others who abandoned their pursuit of nuclear arms, such as Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya.
“俄罗斯公民”在叙利亚，声明说 ， “ 他们是出于不尽相同的原因自愿前往 ， ” 而“军方没有权力评估他们的决定的可行性和合法性 。 ”	“Russian citizens” were in Syria, it said, “of their own free will and for different reasons,” and the “ministry does not have the authority to assess the validity and legality of their decisions.”
但我也不赞成那些认定革命制度党胜利就意味着一切将自动恢复原状的说法，似乎在他们看来墨西哥自身，该国与世界的联系以及革命制度党在过去12年都原地踏步似的。	But I reject the notion that a PRI victory would automatically restore the status quo ante, as if Mexico, its links to the world, and the PRI itself had stood still throughout the last 12 years.
当然，这种成功不仅是经济学意义上的：如果马来西亚遵循了国际货币基金组织推荐的政策，它就已经撕裂了其在过去四十年来所创建的社会结构。	This success was, of course, not only a matter of economics: had Malaysia followed the policies recommended by the IMF, it would have torn apart the social fabric created over the preceding four decades.
但对于这些政治陈词滥调，我们必须三思，就像本月早些时候我离开英国竞选舞台，出席洛杉矶米尔肯研究所全球会议（Milken Institute Global Conference）时那样。	But step back for a moment from these political clichés, as I did earlier this month when I fled the British election campaign to attend the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles.
乐观主义者则认为还存在极大的快速增长空间，因为宏观经济基本面已经大有改善，而且最先进技术也被广泛引入各国，带来更可靠的前景。	Optimists argue that the potential for rapid growth remains immense, owing to better macroeconomic fundamentals and the promise of best-practice technology spreading throughout the emerging world.
而作为政治外部人士，他拥有独一无二的地位引导印尼走向更繁荣、更团结的未来 — — 也使他本人进入印尼伟大领导人俱乐部。	And, as a political outsider, he is in a unique position to direct Indonesia toward a more prosperous, united future – and vault himself into the country’s pantheon of great leaders.
但购买我在一家加沙高档超市看到的果酱、健康麦片、香醋和罐装柠檬酱与普通百姓无关，80%的加沙民众依靠紧急粮食配给维持生计。	But the ability to buy the jams, muesli, balsamic vinegar, and pots of lemon curd that I saw in an up-market Gazan supermarket will not do much for ordinary people, 80% of whom depend on emergency food rations.
那时候的美国财政部副部长劳伦斯·桑莫斯（Lawrence Summers）试图改变世界银行对贫困问题所作的十年报告 — — 降低对安全缺乏和赋权问题的关注程度，把焦点更集中地放在收入问题上 — — 但是世界银行胜利了。	When then US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers tried to change the Bank’s Decennial report on poverty – to downgrade concerns about insecurity and empowerment and to focus more narrowly on income – the Bank prevailed.
通过互相连接以及将课程挂上网络，全世界大学可以在发现和促进基于科学的复杂问题解决之道方面变得更加高效。	By linking together, and putting their curricula online, the world’s universities can become even more effective in discovering and promoting science-based solutions to complex problems.
成功度过这些危机的金融机构再接再厉，在推动进一步的发展中发挥了关键性的作用，并且因为经受住了危机的考验而获得了更高的声誉。	The financial institutions that survived the crises went on to play a crucial role in pushing further development, and they had enhanced reputations because they withstood a crisis.
我们应该记得在冷战时期面临着同样战略担忧的美国及其盟国也支持了扎伊尔、智利和硬度尼西亚等国的暴虐政权。	It should be remembered that America and its allies, faced with strategic fears of a similar type during the Cold War, also supported repugnant and oppressive regimes in places like Zaire, Chile, and Indonesia.
事实上，基因，甚至完整的生命体，已经可以虚拟移动 — — 在每个移动端都是黏糊糊的生物质，但在移动途中只是一连串1和0。	In fact, genes, even entire organisms, can already move virtually – squishy and biological at each end, but nothing more than a series of ones and zeros while en route.
但真正的问题是自尊和社会比较过程。 据心理学家莱昂·费斯廷格（Leon Festinger）观察，这是普遍的人类心理。	But the real issue is self-esteem and the social-comparison processes that psychologist Leon Festinger observed as a universal human trait.
但另一方面，被认为是埃及最强的独立反对派集团的“穆斯林兄弟会 ” ， 却敦促其追随者凭良心投票，并不要支持任何“专制、腐败的统治者 ” 。	On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood, thought to be the single strongest opposition group in Egypt, are urging their followers to caste ballots and vote their conscience but not to give support to any ‘despotic, corrupt rulers.’
英国一位著名的移植外科大夫在《英国医学杂志》上号召为非亲活体捐赠者通过一个加以控制的捐献者补偿计划。	In the British Medical Journal , a leading British transplant surgeon called for a controlled donor compensation program for unrelated live donors.
NTC的无能在对卡扎菲的儿子赛义夫·伊斯兰·卡扎菲的审判上反映地尤其明显。 虽然安理会被视为“旧制度”最忠诚的守护者，但是在对他的起诉方面理事会的进展甚微。	The NTC’s paralysis is clearly reflected in the trial of Qaddafi’s son, Saif al-Islam el-Qaddafi. Though considered the most prized captive of the ancien regime, the Council has made little progress in prosecuting him.
多年来，美国一直要求只有中国开放资本账户、允许其货币自由浮动，并具备独立中央银行时才能将人民币纳入SDR。	The US had argued for years that the renminbi should be included in the SDR only if China opened its capital account, let its currency float freely, and had a more independent central bank.
当我们要求警官说出他们为什么把当事人列为嫌疑人的理由时，他们就会更多考虑当事人行为的因素，而不是仅仅出自偏见。	When officers are required to articulate grounds for suspicion, they are more likely to rely on behavioral factors rather than prejudice.
示威者动员了整个国家，他们决心要让亚努科维奇信守签署欧盟协议、不让乌克兰加入与俄罗斯的关税联盟的承诺。	Determined to hold him to his promise to sign the EU agreement and not take Ukraine into a customs union with Russia, the protesters mobilized the country.
天主教会曾经试图镇压科学和理性，最著名的便是迫害伽利略，而如今，天主教会在捍卫科学和理性，否认事实的是美国保守派政客。	Whereas the Catholic Church once tried to suppress science and reason, most notably in its condemnation of Galileo, it is now defending them, while conservative US politicians deny the facts.
英国保守党将东扩看作是延缓深层次融合的一种手段，而德国总理赫尔穆特·科尔却认为这两种动态是可以兼容的。	While British Conservatives saw expansion as a means to slow deepening integration, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl considered both dynamics compatible.
如果密克罗尼西亚联邦的承诺得到复制，那么构成太平洋地区经济支柱的自然资源控制权将重新回到太平洋民众的手中。	If FSM’s commitment is replicated, citizens of the Pacific could reclaim control over a natural resource that forms the backbone of the region’s economies.
假使这种变化成为趋势 — — 现在看来这种可能性很大 — — 必将影响到经济表现、市场运作和资产估价。	To the extent that this shift gains momentum – which appears likely – it will affect economic performance, the functioning of markets, and asset-price valuations.
当然，自从去年以来，东帝汶就处于政局不稳的状态。 安全部队的对立派别之间发生冲突导致该国进入短暂的法律与秩序崩溃状态。	Of course, Timor Leste has been in something of a political limbo since last year, when clashes between rival factions in the security forces led to a brief breakdown of law and order.
首先，全球房地产泡沫的屋顶正开始塌陷，因为不但是美国的房地产市场开始变得冷清，其他许多国家，包括房价飞涨的西班牙也正面临这一局面。	For starters, the roof is starting to collapse on the global housing bubble, as housing markets begin to freeze up not only in the United States, but also in many other countries, such as high-flying Spain.
我们有权力去除金融系统中迅速增加的债务，创造一个新的、与自由企业原则和法治精神相适应的货币秩序而不产生整个支付系统崩溃的风险。	We have it in our power to eliminate the financial system’s rapidly growing debt and to create a new monetary order that corresponds to free-enterprise principles and the rule of law, without risking a breakdown of the entire payment system.
伯克利—美国公众对政府，尤其是联邦政府的态度就像是巨蟒剧团（Monty Python）的《布莱恩的一生 》 （ Life of Brian）中的经典一幕。	BERKELEY – The American public’s attitude toward government, especially toward the federal government, recalls a classic scene in Monty Python’s “Life of Brian.”
5月2日，莫拉莱斯在对合同重新谈判之前一举转变了百分比，也就是在两个最大的油田运作的公司得到其产量的18 ％ 。	On May 2, Morales simply reversed the percentages, pending renegotiation of the contracts: the companies operating in the two largest fields would get 18% of the production for themselves.
监管者最近开始警觉该行业过度使用杠杆的激励 — — 也意识到了如此大的杠杆对贷款人和整体经济的风险。	Regulators have recently woken up to the incentives for excessive leverage in this sector – and to the risks that such leverage poses to lenders and the broader economy.
而第一个象征性步骤就是要让美国将其海军基地撤出冲绳 — — 这是一个长期承担着美国军事存在的压力，并已经不堪重负的地区。	Hence, the first symbolic step was to get the US to move its marines from Okinawa, an island that has carried the burden of a US military presence for much too long.
此外，该法案获得赞成票数足以推翻总统的否决权，因此特朗普别无选择，只能签署它，他也低调地这么做了，并没有按照惯例邀请法案发起人和媒体在场。	And, because the bill passed with enough votes to override a presidential veto, Trump had little choice but to sign it, which he did in private, without the customary presence of a bill’s sponsors and the press.
整体投资增长预计达到2.9 % ， 这按照过去的标准而言是软弱的，但是对于受伤的德国情绪而言却是大有希望的宽慰。	Total investment growth is expected to reach 2.9% – weak by past standards, but nonetheless a promising salve for the wounded German mood.
因此，对每100美元的注入资金，我们可以用60美元来购买资产而剩下40美元的用来补贴公司创造工作 — — 这对那些拥有允许短期雇佣的灵活劳动力市场的经济特别有效。	Thus, for every $100 of new liquidity, we could use $60 to purchase assets and the remainder to give firms a marginal job-creation subsidy, which could be especially effective in economies with flexible labor markets that enable short-term hiring.
这种起源神话会无限继续下去，直到我们找到人类的共同祖先，或者一个真正的神话 — — 在中国的一个黑蛋，在日本海的一个长矛，或者是在法国火与冰的交互作用。	The origin myth continues ad infinitum until we reach humanity’s common ancestor, or an actual myth – a black egg in China, a spear in the ocean in Japan, or the interaction of fire and ice in France.
市中心的一家餐馆，编辑蒂娜·布朗邀请了希拉里·克林顿和其他几位知名人士，包括卡罗琳·肯尼迪、导演迈克尔·摩尔和前任参议员乔治·麦戈文。	The setting is a downtown restaurant to which the editor Tina Brown has invited Hillary Clinton and a handful of notables, including Caroline Kennedy, filmmaker Michael Moore, and former Senator George McGovern.
报告作者认为 ， “ 数字隐私和安全主要不是取决于数字在真实世界的何处储存或发送，而取决于它如何储存和传输 。 ”	The authors conclude that “data privacy and security depend primarily not on where data is physically stored or sent, but on how it is stored and transmitted.”
这就是所谓的“战略轰炸 ” ， 有时也称为“威慑轰炸 ” ， 这种战争方式是为了通过摧毁一个民族的“生命中枢”摧毁他们的意志。	This is what used to be called “strategic bombing,” or sometimes “terror bombing,” a method of warfare designed to break the will of a people by destroying its “vital centers.”
如果时任政府选择使用财政政策，未来债务与GDP之比将进一步上升至相当于GDP100％以上，从而进一步推高长期利率。	If the government at that time chooses to use fiscal policy, the future debt-to-GDP ratio will rise further above 100% of GDP, forcing long-term interest rates even higher.
在塞尔维亚，大量的沼气（一种对温室效应影响极大的气体）都被封存在曾被称为“永久冻土”的地区，因为人们相信这些地区的土地都将永久处于封冻状态。	In Siberia, vast quantities of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, are locked up in what used to be called “permafrost” – regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen.
美国的真正问题不是来自中国的竞争；而是实现规模达到17.5万亿美元的经济从化石燃料转向低碳替代燃料的复杂性。	America’s real problem is not competition from China; it’s the complexity of shifting a $17.5 trillion economy from fossil fuels to low-carbon alternatives.
由此产生的道德风险又激励了另一轮大干快上的贷款，进一步推动了发展中国家在随后十年中多次爆发金融危机。	The resulting moral hazard would encourage another bout of exuberant lending, which led to further financial crises in developing countries in the subsequent decade.
如果考虑到许多别的国家彼此之间也有海洋领域的冲突，许多国际观察家也许会原谅中国在南中国海的所做作为。	Many international observers might forgive China its behavior in the South China Sea, given that many countries, large and small, have maritime disputes with neighbors.
ISP比起政府来说，应该提供简单的安全防范 — — 杀毒软件，反钓鱼软件，防范垃圾邮件等等 — — 这些都是一些基本的网络用户所需要的服务，实施起来也不会很困难。	The ISPs (rather than governments) should provide basic security – anti-virus, anti-phishing, anti-spam, and the like – as a regular feature of consumer Internet services.
而伊斯兰国的逊尼派极端主义者正在不惜一切手段寻求建立哈里发帝国。 伊斯兰国的崛起给伊拉克和叙利亚带来了难以名状的恐怖。	And the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State, whose dramatic rise has entailed untold horrors to Iraq and Syria, are seeking to establish a caliphate, by whatever means necessary.
当年明治维新在“富国强兵”的口号下创造了一支强大的军队，终于造成了尾大不掉之局，文职政府不得不受军队摆布。	The Meiji Restoration created a powerful military under the slogan “Enrich the country and strengthen the military.” The military eventually became so strong that it could dictate terms to the civilian government.
许多研究也显示很少有哪个主要资产价格上涨的时期不是伴着，如果不是跟着的话，货币和/或信贷的强劲上升。	Many studies have also shown that there is hardly any major asset price inflation episode which was not accompanied if not preceded by strong growth of money and/or credit.
美国和拉美的主流模式一直是占优势地位的白人群体拒绝与黑人和土著人种共享医疗和教育领域的公共投资，这种公共投资也被形象地称为“人的资本 ” 。	A dominant pattern in both the US and Latin America has been the resistance of the dominant white communities to sharing in the financing of public investments in the “human capital” (health and education) of the black and indigenous communities.
即便监管协调不会导致双方贸易竞争拼杀到最后一滴血，但投资者和出口商的不同利益会在社会和环境目标上笼罩一个比以往更深的阴影。	Even if regulatory harmonization does not create a race to the bottom, the interests of investors and exporters will cast a longer shadow than before over social and environmental goals.
换句话说，美国向其盟友传递的信息是，它不会在干预非当务之急的地区，除非其盟友率先行动，这就好比是投资者等待推销者付首付。	In other words, the US is conveying to its allies that it will no longer intervene in low-priority areas unless its allies commit first, just like an investor waiting for the promoter to make a down payment.
这样的饲养方法在本质上是要节约人工，从而降低牲畜管理的难度，使饲养着数以万计甚至十万计牲畜的养殖场能够减少雇工人数，降低对所雇人员的技能要求。	These methods are, essentially, labor-saving devices – they make management of the animals easier and enable units with thousands or tens of thousands of animals to employ fewer and less skilled workers.
正如布莱尔不久前所说的那样，这样一种自下而上的和平进程甚至可以同内塔尼亚胡的“经济和平”目标和谐共处，虽然它最终必将超越上述领域。	As Blair recently put it, such a bottom-up process may even go hand-in-hand with Netanyahu’s goal of an “economic peace,” though it would eventually have to go beyond it.
他是打败种族隔离制度 — — 然后让南非和平过渡到由人口占多数的黑人进行长期统治 — — 的自豪的一代人的一部分。	He is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid – and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black-majority rule.
我们现在已经知道高碳增长路径对自然环境造成的后果以及反过来对生活质量的影响，这些成本实际可能为负值。	Given what we know now about the consequences of the high-carbon path for the natural environment and, in turn, health outcomes and quality of life, those costs could actually be negative.
沙特阿拉伯 — — 其初生牛犊不怕虎的王储默罕默德·本·萨勒曼（Mohammed bin Salman）获得了特朗普的全力支持 — — 最近在也门朝利雅得发射导弹事件后指责伊朗的“战争行为 ” 。	Saudi Arabia – whose audacious young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has Trump’s full support – recently accused Iran of an “act of war” after a missile was launched from Yemen toward Riyadh.
不过，虽然他分而治之的策略在一段时间内发挥了作用，使得他手中聚集了前所未有的权力，但社会分裂和长期贫困的真相却无法掩饰。	But, though his divide and rule strategy worked for a while, allowing him to concentrate an unprecedented amount of power in his own hands, it could not hide the truth of our social divisions and continuing impoverishment.
显而易见的是，朝鲜成功无核化将需要大胆的政治决策 — — 比如正式结束朝鲜战争、开设联络处或者放松某些经济制裁 — — 以及务实的谨慎。	What is clear is that successful denuclearization of North Korea will require a combination of bold political decisions – say, formally ending the Korean War, opening liaison offices, or relaxing some economic sanctions – and realistic prudence.
在巴勒斯坦武装分子于1985年劫持了意大利邮轮“阿齐利·劳罗”号，杀死一名美国人并将船停泊在埃及港口时，美国要求穆巴拉克引渡这些人。	After Palestinians in 1985 hijacked the Italian ship Achille Lauro, killed an American, and berthed in Egypt, the US asked Mubarak to extradite them.
由于经济学有着引人入胜的外表，而社会民主不可或缺，因此两种思想发生了演变以互相适应 — — 这并不是说他们的结合是和谐的。	Because economics appears to be compelling, and because social democracy is indispensable, the two doctrines have mutated to accommodate each other – which is not to say that their marriage is a happy one.
今天，许多投资者把他们以前心目中无能的政府庞然大物看作金融天才，它们可以驾驭复杂的金融公式并且利用它们的超大规模和贸易信息来挤压利率和汇率市场的活力。	Today, many traders see formerly inept state giants as financial geniuses, capable of taming complex financial formulas and exploiting their superior size and trading information to squeeze the life out of currency and interest rate markets.
2009—2014年我出任北约秘书长期间，我们一再强调，北约导弹防御系统的目的是保护盟友免受来自欧洲-大西洋地区之外的威胁。	When I served as NATO Secretary General from 2009 to 2014, we repeatedly emphasized that the purpose was to defend Alliance members from threats originating outside the Euro-Atlantic area.
但路易斯维尔某些社区仅有最低限度的林木覆盖，导致这座城市成为美国发展最快的热岛之一 — — 并促使自然保护协会开展有针对性的植树工作。	Yet there are neighborhoods in Louisville with minimal tree cover, making the city one of the fastest-growing heat islands in the United States – and prompting The Nature Conservancy to initiate a targeted tree-planting effort.
但我们知道，新技术和创新正在推动能源生产、食品和清洁水市场以及如今正日渐稀缺和宝贵的基本生态服务的变革。	But we know that new technology and innovation are driving changes in the way that energy is produced, how new markets for food and clean water are emerging, and how basic ecological services are now becoming scarce and valued.
比方说，尽管古兰经允许对女性的继承权进行考量，但部族惯例对此却并不认可，这也可以解释为什么靠欺骗妇女放弃继承权来解决继承问题在部族委员会如此盛行。	For example, while the Koran allows for a measure of female inheritance, tribal custom does not authorize it, which explains the popularity of tribal councils to resolve inheritance problems and cheat women out of their rights.
第七，让我们希望以信息和通信技术为目标的新政策能够在所有利益相关者的竞争和合理关切之间取得适当的平衡。	Seventh, let us hope that new policies targeting information and communication technology (ICT) strike the right balance among all stakeholders’ competing and legitimate concerns.
持续强劲的增长以及上扬的总体需求还在中国以外的地方造成生产瓶颈，最主要的是在农业商品和采矿行业。 这就把石油价格推到了100多美元一桶。	Sustained robust growth and rising aggregate demand have also caused production bottlenecks outside of China, most notably in the agricultural commodity and mining sectors, which have helped lift oil prices to more than $100 per barrel.
此外，伊斯兰金融还更加公平：贷款人和借款人共担风险和盈利，因此能够更关注长期目标，抑制了过度承担短期风险的行为。	Moreover, Islamic finance is more equitable: lenders and borrowers share risks and rewards, which increases the focus on long-term goals and discourages excessive short-term risk-taking.
在东中国海和南中国海存在着武装冲突的危险，而朝鲜不顾美国和联合国的更严厉制裁持续研发核武器和弹道导弹。	There is a risk of armed clashes in the East and South China Seas, and North Korea continues to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, despite tougher sanctions pushed by the United States and the United Nations.
而虽然在金融危机的爆发过程中有许多壮举，但许多中央银行家在危机的余波中却表现得过度僵化。 一方面过于担心将通胀目标定得过高，另一方面又对通缩的动力估计不足。	And for all of their heroics during the financial crisis, many central bankers have been far too inflexible in the aftermath, worrying too much about overshooting inflation targets, and too little about deflationary dynamics.
因此人们被强制储蓄，以防止作弊 — — 在年轻时不储蓄，因为他知道老来无论如何都可以获得最低限度的社会福利。	So individuals are forced to save in order to prevent them from gaming the system – not saving when young, knowing that they will be assured a minimum level of support by a humane society when old.
在新书《炼金术的终结 》 （ The End of Alchemy）中英格兰银行前行长默文·金（Mervyn King）指出，用抑制信用直接干预按揭市场应该接受政治决定的约束。	In his new book The End of Alchemy, former BoE Governor Mervyn King argues that direct intervention in the mortgage market by restraining credit should be subject to political decision.
闻名遐迩的硅谷风投企业Sequoia Capital、Northgate Capital和Comcast Ventures都是它的投资者。	It counts influential Silicon Valley firms such as Sequoia Capital, Northgate Capital, and Comcast Ventures as investors.
在一个良性的正向全球供应冲击时期之后，一个正向的全球需求冲击已经导致全球经济过热和通货膨胀压力的加大。	Following a benign period of a positive global supply shock, a positive global demand shock has led to global overheating and rising inflationary pressures.
一个非政府组织在那天杀死的美国人比日本政府在另一个具有转折意义的日子，1941年12月7日，发动突然袭击杀害的人数还要多。	A non-governmental group killed more Americans that day than the government of Japan did with its surprise attack on another transformative date, December 7, 1941.
对于美国国会在前几次贸易协定（比如与秘鲁的贸易协定）中坚持的原则，USTR办公室出尔反尔 — — 比如非专利药问题。	The USTR’s office is backtracking on principles – for example, access to generic medicines – that Congress had inserted into earlier trade agreements, like that with Peru.
因此，和现在一样，监管机构需要先发制人地实施破产而不是依赖它，因为只要倒闭金融公司递交破产申请，就相当于签署了死亡保证书。	So, as it stands now, regulators need to preempt bankruptcy, not rely on it, because as soon as any failed financial firm files for bankruptcy, it has signed its own death warrant.
但回想一下过去一百年来的地缘政治动荡 — — 两次世界大战、苏联的崛起和衰亡以及其他 — — 我们就不能排除导致未来新超级大国对立的全球阵营。	But when we recall the geopolitical convulsions of the last century – two world wars, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and so forth – we cannot rule out a global realignment that leads to a future standoff between new superpowers.
我还与行业专家讨论了这个观点，他们大多相信存在这样一个平衡点，但它常常波动，因为受石油生产的边际成本影响极大，而这个成本本身是一个不稳定的变量。	I have also discussed the idea with industry experts, most of whom believe that one exists, but that it moves around a lot, because it is greatly influenced by the marginal cost of oil production – itself an unstable variable.
如果你时运不济，既没有在英格兰东南部买房，又没有参加最重薪资养老金计划，那么你的财富额就会停滞不前甚至缩水。	If you are not lucky enough to own property in the Southeast of England, and are not in a final-salary pension scheme, your wealth has stagnated or fallen.
任何新的金融机构监管体系都应该建立在运作良好的国家以及区域机构（在欧盟仍然不存在这样的机构）网络之上，并且也应该包含用全球视野对金融机构进行的真正的国际监管。	Any new regulatory system should be based on a well functioning network of national and regional authorities (still missing in the European Union) and include truly international supervision of financial institutions with a global reach.
美国土木工程师协会（American Society of Civil Engineers）的一份2013年报告给美国基础设施的总体评分是D+。	A 2013 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the US a pathetic overall grade of D+ for its infrastructure.
国民储蓄2005年已经差不多占到了国民生产总值的50 % ， 这显然意味着中国家庭对医疗、教育以及他们所梦想拥有的新住房的首期付款惶恐不安。	National savings amounted to roughly 50% of GDP in 2005, which apparently means that households are so afraid of hospital bills, school fees, and the down-payment on the new apartment they dream of that they save every penny they earn.
中国应该暂时免于承担和消费者相关联的责任，但在认识到这些部门实施有效减排需要相应的国际行动后，也应该承担自身在工业生产上的责任。	China should be excused of consumer-related obligations for the time being, but assume commitments on industrial production based on the recognition that effectively reducing emissions in these sectors requires coordinated international action.
此外，肯尼迪也从古巴导弹危机吸取了教训；1963年6月10日，他发表了一次旨在平息冷战紧张局势的演讲。	Moreover, Kennedy learned from the Cuban missile crisis as well; on June 10, 1963, he gave a speech aimed at easing Cold War tensions.
1971年，当二战后的美元固定汇率体系崩溃之后，当时担任美国财政部长的约翰•康纳利人所尽知地告诉其他国家的财长 ， “ 美元是我们的货币，但同时也是你们的问题 。 ”	In 1971, as the dollar collapsed towards the end of the post-World War II fixed exchange-rate system, US Treasury Secretary John Connally famously told his foreign counterparts that “the dollar is our currency, but your problem.”
问题在于他们常常用错了抗生素，要么把它们用于补救不合理的农业做法 — — 如过度拥挤的工厂化农场让疾病更加容易传播 — — 要么把它们用于加快生长和降低生产成本。	The problem is that they commonly misuse antibiotics either to compensate for poor agricultural practices – such as overcrowding on factory farms, which encourages the spread of disease – or to accelerate growth and reduce production costs.
他们不去想如何抵消经济活动中如1930年代深度收缩那样的过剩性波动，而是把焦点放在维持充分就业的所谓稳定性政策之上。	Instead of pursuing measures to counter excessive fluctuations in economic activity, such as the deep contraction of the 1930’s, so-called stabilization policies focused on measures that aimed to maintain full employment.
中国领导人知道，只要能获得公平市场准入待遇，民营中小企业将是远比大型国有垄断巨头更为可靠的创新和就业源泉。	China’s leaders know that private small and medium-size enterprises with fair market access would be a far more reliable source of innovation and jobs than are large state-owned monopolies.
俄罗斯天然气工业公司的产量正以令人震惊的速度下滑；在国内，那些只依靠一种产业存活的“单一城镇”正在衰亡。	Gazprom’s production is falling at a dizzying pace; the country’s single-industry “mono-towns” are dying.
1967年以来的每一位美国总统都试图解决以巴冲突，其中，克林顿所提出的和平协议条件最为周全合理，这是每一位外国政治家都承认的事实。	Every American president since 1967 has sought to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, with Bill Clinton offering the most thorough and judicious parameters for a peace settlement ever conceived by any foreign statesman.
布什政府对例如联合国 、 《 京都议定书 》 、 国际刑事法院、禁止地雷或反弹道导弹公约等事务方面也没有态度缓和的迹象。	There are no signs that the Bush administration is relenting on, for example, the UN, the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court, the ban on land mines, or the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
美国电影导演马丁·斯科塞斯（Martin Scorsese）正在构思基于远藤周作（Shusaku Endo）的小说《沉默 》 （ Silence）改编这些事件。	The American film director Martin Scorsese is now completing an adaptation of these events, based on Shusaku Endo’s novel Silence.
在《拉丁美洲如何抵御了全球金融危机 》 （ How Latin America Weathered the Global Financial Crisis）中，他结合近期历史和个人洞见提出了一套关于如何实施更平衡的政策方针的优美理论 — — 不管对于新兴市场还是其他地区。	In How Latin America Weathered the Global Financial Crisis, he combines recent history and personal insight to offer a fascinating account of how to apply a more balanced policy approach – both in emerging markets and more broadly.
东京—12月将是日本首相安倍晋三的妥协之月，他将与在二战中击败日本的两个国家的领导人会晤：美国和俄罗斯。	TOKYO – December will be a month of reconciliation for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as he meets with leaders from two countries that fought Japan in World War II: the United States and Russia.
英国和其他北欧国家的高级部长以扶手椅行为经济学为借口，提出地中海救援行动鼓励更多移民尝试危险的海洋偷渡。	Senior ministers in the United Kingdom and other northern European countries, relying on little more than armchair behavioral economics, argued that Mare Nostrum encouraged more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing.
这种恶性循环只有当英国消费者遭受实际收入下降时才会停止 — — 其下降幅度之大，在发达国家范围内都是罕见的。	This doom loop would stop only when British consumers suffered a fall in real income of a magnitude not typically seen outside developing countries.
好消息是私人和公共部门 — — 受粮食需求激增（特别是快速增长的非洲城市）和全球粮食价格上涨的推动 — — 似乎已准备推进这场变革。	The good news is that both the private and public sectors – motivated by soaring demand for food, especially in Africa’s rapidly growing cities, and rising global food prices – seem ready to propel this shift.
在2015年9月排名前十位的经济学家中，有六位在2006年12月便已进入前十，另有两人分别位居第11和第13。	Among the top ten economists in September 2015, six were already there in December 2006, and another two were ranked 11 and 13.
这似乎就是我们专注于像《京都议定书》这一类的让自我感觉良好的方式的原因。 它的根本问题从来就是既好高骛远，又不符合环境逻辑，还代价不菲。	This seems to be why we focus on feel-good approaches like the Kyoto Protocol, whose fundamental problem has always been that it is simultaneously impossibly ambitious, environmentally inconsequential, and inordinately expensive.
第四次工业革命将同样充满变革意味：单一技术无疑将极具影响力，但我们的社会和经济制度变化却更能塑造未来的生活。	The Fourth Industrial Revolution will be no less transformative: individual technologies will be influential, but changes in our social and economic systems will do far more to shape our future lives.
毕竟 ， “ 布鲁塞尔”搞的是独裁，他们说，而英国人 — — 或者说，英格兰人 — — 为民主而战。	“Brussels,” after all, is a dictatorship, they say, and the British – or, rather, the English – are standing up for democracy.
或许以色列采取顽固立场的最明确信号来自其经济部长纳福塔里·本尼特（Naftali Bennett）在去年7月所说的话。	Perhaps the clearest indication of Israel’s obstinacy came from its economy minister, Naftali Bennett, last July.
我相信，中国如果能够成功地和可持续性地提高消费，她的发展道路定将进入一个新的时代 - - 中国的经济将继续快速增长，创造更多的就业，增加社会福利，对自然资源的需求更少，最终达到大大提高的经济增长质量，并支持更平衡的全球经济增长。	A stronger currency would increase household income. It would also create a powerful incentive for companies to expand into the service economy, providing more jobs and more choices for Chinese consumers.
内生复苏不足以及经济达不到逃逸速度将使央行政策的效应消失殆尽，让政治僵局恶化，导致金融损失、波动性激增和大规模风险管理风险。	With insufficient endogenous healing and no economic escape velocity, the effectiveness of central banks’ policies wanes and political dysfunction increases, leading to financial losses, volatility spikes, and huge risk-management challenges.
我们需要采取所有上述的甚至更多的行动，来向俄罗斯发出信号，那就是欧洲不愿在俄罗斯重拾大国政治时袖手旁观。	All of this, and much more, is needed to send a clear signal to Russia that Europe is unwilling to stand idly by as it returns to great power politics.
让事情进一步复杂化的是，特朗普声称他对利率上升并不“感到兴奋”的讲话表明过度合规的美联储最终有可能会落后于通胀弧线。	Complicating matters further, Trump’s statement that he is not “thrilled” at the prospect of higher interest rates points to the risk of a too-compliant Federal Reserve ending up behind the inflationary curveball.
而从前的敌人并没有被惩罚，而是被教育 — — 通过大量美国资金补助的文化和政治项目 — — 变得更像是美国人。	And, instead of being punished, the former enemies were educated – through cultural and political programs, richly subsidized by US money – to be more like Americans.
如果美国要成为世界“不可或缺的伙伴 ” ， 它就必须重新致力于在过去七十年给它 — — 以及全世界 — — 带来无穷好处的基于规则的秩序。	"If the US is to serve as the world's “indispensable partner,"" it must recommit to the rules-based order that has served it – and the world – so well for the last seven decades."
在右翼，美国众议院议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）的美国扩张机会（Expanding Opportunity in America）认定美国已经花了足够多的钱，只需要更好地花这些钱。	On the right, Speaker of the US House of Representatives Paul Ryan’s Expanding Opportunity in America anchors the view that America already spends enough and just needs to spend it better.
相反，需要的是包括像中国、印度这样的重要国家以及其他对经济增长要比对“破坏”国际体系更感兴趣的国家的“稳定联盟 ” 。	What is needed, instead, is a “stability league” that includes prominent actors like China, India, and other countries that are more interested in economic growth than in “rocking the boat” of the international system.
1996年，在尼日利亚北部脑膜炎大规模流行期间，制药公司辉瑞向医务人员提供了口服抗生素特洛芬，目的是与另外一种药物头孢曲松钠进行对比。	In 1996, during a major meningitis epidemic in northern Nigeria, the drug company Pfizer supplied doctors with the oral antibiotic Trovan, which was being tested against another drug, ceftriaxone.
当国际特赦组织将其注意力扩展从国际政治和公民权利扩展到全方位的经济、社会和文化权利时，在方向上和影响上迷失了很长一段时间。	When Amnesty International broadened its focus from traditional political and civil rights to the whole range of economic, social, and cultural rights, it seemed for quite some time to lose direction and impact.
这还能提供一个可替代现有条件留在欧元区的方案，以此增强希腊在讨价还价中的筹码，谈判确保希腊不退出的协议。	It would also offer a credible alternative to remaining in the eurozone under current terms, thereby strengthening Greece's hand in bargaining for a deal that ensures that Grexit does not in fact occur.
悄无声息地采用自下而上的方法相当于心照不宣地承认不能强迫各国遵守一项严格的集中制度，即使上述制度的依据是科学。	The quiet adoption of a bottom-up approach is a tacit admission that countries cannot be forced to abide by a strict, centralized regime, even if it is based on scientific evidence.
在亚洲发展中国家中，侨汇（即移民工人寄给往往生活在贫困和边远地区的祖国家庭的汇款）的力量和潜力是巨大的。	In Asia’s developing countries, the power and potential of remittances – the money that migrant workers send home to their families (many of whom live in poor and remote areas) – is immense.
最高面额钞票 — — 100玻利瓦尔纸币 — — 在2008年引入时价值46.5美元，如今只值0.03美元，买点小东西都得用到一大捆钞票。	The highest-denomination banknote, the 100-bolivar bill, which was worth $46.5 when it was introduced in 2008, fell to just $0.03, requiring mountains of bills to make small payments.
但是，随着美国货币政策继续向利率正常化迈进，极有可能产生经济和金融连锁反应，特别是货币波动和破坏性流出新兴经济体。	But, as US monetary policy follows the path of interest-rate normalization, there could well be knock-on effects, both economic and financial, especially in the form of currency volatility and destabilizing outflows from emerging economies.
诺贝尔经济学奖得主阿马蒂亚·森（Amartya Sen）在会上指出，欧洲的危机源自于四个方面的失效 — — 政治、经济，社会和智力层面。	Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures – political, economic, social, and intellectual.
普京想表达的是，美国没有希望重新获得绝对的军事支配权，即使它决心像曾经的苏联那样在军备竞赛中流尽最后一滴血。	The message was that the US cannot hope to regain absolute military superiority, even if it decides to bleed itself dry in an arms race, as the Soviet Union did.
随着2003年3月土耳其议会对美国军队开辟伊战北线的计划投下反对票，土耳其与美国之间传统的战略伙伴关系终于走到了尽头。	When Turkey's parliament voted in March 2003 against allowing American troops to open a northern front against Iraq, Turkey's traditional strategic partnership with the United States ended.
可以肯定，未来的挑战涉及面既广泛又复杂；但人们越来越清楚地认识到过渡到低碳经济收获的经济利益将十分可观。	To be sure, the challenge ahead is as broad as it is complex; but it is becoming increasingly clear that making the transition to a low-carbon economy will bring considerable economic benefits.
如今这些城市农园仍然是英国都市人的一种流行维生方式；约有35万人被分配了土地，另有80万人正在排队等待分配。	Today, these urban gardens remain a popular means of sustenance for British urbanites; an estimated 350,000 people have allotments and another 800,000 want them.
但是，由于这无法同时在所有主要经济体发生 — — 一个国家（或一组国家）的紧缩意味着其他国家产品需求下降 — — 这些政策最终会导致以邻为壑局面。	But, because this cannot happen for all major economies simultaneously – one country’s (or group of countries’) austerity implies less demand for other countries’ products – such policies eventually lead to beggar-thy-neighbor situations.
相反，欧盟必须重组为两个核心圈：致力于加深一体化的内核，以及选民对单一货币和共同财政空间不感兴趣的外围。	Instead, the EU must reshape itself into two concentric circles: an inner core committed to deeper integration, and an outer ring whose voters have no interest in a single currency and a shared fiscal space.
欧盟委员会最新的《欧洲未来白皮书 》 （ White Paper on the Future of Europe）为欧洲列出了五条可能的道路，包括将欧盟注意力收缩到单一市场、深化和扩大一体化等。	The Commission’s recent “White Paper on the Future of Europe” that sets out five possible paths forward for Europe, from narrowing the EU’s focus to the single market to deepening and broadening integration.
一些欧元区决策者似乎自信满满地认为希腊退出欧元 — — 不管是硬退出还是软退出 — — 都不再是对其他外围国的威胁。	Some eurozone policymakers seem to be confident that a Greek exit from the euro, hard or soft, will no longer pose a threat to the other periphery countries.
而在2010年希腊危机爆发前，拜希腊政府使用金融衍生品和创造性会计手段所赐，希腊财政赤字和债务负担一直被认为比实际情况小得多。	And, until Greece’s crisis in 2010, the country’s fiscal deficits and debt burden were thought to be much smaller than they were, thanks to the use of financial derivatives and creative accounting by the Greek government.
美联储（以及其他国家央行和官方机构，如国际货币基金组织）所使用的通胀目标模型都假设存在着某个对非通胀型失业率的预设限值。	The inflation-targeting models used by the Fed (and other central banks and official institutions like the International Monetary Fund) all assume the existence of some pre-determined limit to non-inflationary unemployment.
最后，你很难从理论上论证为何卢克必须为Nexus缴纳“所得”税，而不必为Nexus所操作的收割机缴纳所得税。	Finally, it is hard philosophically to justify forcing Luke to pay “income” tax for Nexus but not for the harvester that Nexus operates.
未来，公司和国家之间应当达成一个简单的原则，那就是，借用美国前总统威尔逊令人难忘的话来说 ， “ 合同应当正大光明 ” 。	In the future, companies and countries should agree on a simple principle: there should be, to paraphrase President Woodrow Wilson’s memorable words, “open contracts, openly and transparently arrived at.”
这样持续的政治惰性最终将使越来越年轻化的阿拉伯人受到极端意识形态的吸引，同时驱使最有能力最聪明的人到其他地方寻求发展。	Such continuing political inertia leaves an increasingly young Arab population prey to the appeal of extremist ideologies, while driving the best and brightest to seek their fortune elsewhere.
更一般地，增长的减缓催生了群众游行和社会动荡，特别是在增长曾经很快的国家（如巴西、土耳其和南非 ） ， 因为这给不断提高的生活水平预期造成了影响。	More generally, lower growth is fueling popular protest and social unrest, particularly in countries that were growing rapidly (for example, Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa), owing to the impact of rising living standards on expectations.
相反，用詹姆斯·索罗维基（James Surowiecki）的妙语讲，今天的超级富豪堪称“呻吟大亨 ” 。	By contrast, today’s super-rich are “moaning moguls,” to use James Surowiecki’s evocative term.
传统智慧一直认为军队规模最大的国家将会胜出，但在信息时代获胜的也许是最会讲故事的国家（或非国家 ） 。	Conventional wisdom has always held that the state with the largest military prevails, but in an information age it may be the state (or non-state) with the best story that wins.
但迄今从预算中获益最多的老成员国—如西班牙、希腊和葡萄牙等较穷的国家—则希望预算能够增加以便他们继续接受资金支持。	But the old member states that have hitherto benefited most from the budget – poorer countries like Spain, Greece, and Portugal – want the budget to be expanded, so that they can continue to receive money.
但在2009年 — — 世界卫生组织实施FCTC仅仅六年后、哥伦比亚批准FCTC仅仅15个月后 — — 哥伦比亚政府就出台了全球最严格之一的控烟法。	But in 2009 – just six years after the World Health Organization adopted the FCTC and 15 months after Colombia ratified it – the Colombian government enacted one of the strongest tobacco-control laws in the world.
尽管他们的童年刚刚过去短短几年，但他们却像许多臭名昭著的成人评论家那样指责《哈利波特 》 ： “生编硬造 ” 、 “文笔糟糕 ” 、 “陈词滥调 ” 、 “令人厌烦 ” 。	Despite being only a few years removed from those childhoods, they laid into Harry Potter with the same fervor as many of the notoriously negative adult reviewers: “Derivative.” “Poorly written.”
所有部门都有其外部负责对象，但一些部门的前端“客户代表”性质更重：它们的核心任务包括协调经济中不同部分公共品的供应。	While all ministries have their external constituencies, some ministries have more of a front-end, “account executive” nature: their core mission involves coordinating the provision of public goods to different parts of the economy.
以公民为本的选区重划，公开初选，任职期限变更，多数通过预算，灾害应急基金和立法透明度都是那些有公民意识的领导者为公共利益实施动议程序的直接结果。	Citizen-based redistricting, open primaries, changes to term limits, majority-vote budgets, a rainy-day fund, and legislative transparency have all been the direct result of civic-minded leaders deploying the initiative process for the public good.
而即将于5月21~22日在东京举行的韩中日三国峰会将把核安全作为中心议题，并为创立一个更紧密区域合作的机制做准备。	The coming summit between South Korea, China, and Japan on May 21-22 in Tokyo, for example, will focus on nuclear safety and prepare a regime for closer regional cooperation.
如今，克格勃的继任者联邦安全局（FSB）完全控制了俄罗斯的安全机构，其所动用的手段包括逮捕其他执法机关的高层。	Today, the KGB’s successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB), has seized complete control over Russia’s security apparatus, including by arresting high-level generals in other law-enforcement agencies.
世界领导人需要认识到，当今民粹主义反动正在受到一种失去尊严的感觉的推动 — — 而这种感觉并没有在大部分决策者为经济增长和补偿性支付所开出的药方中获得考虑。	World leaders need to recognize that today’s populist revolts are being fueled by a sense of lost dignity – a sentiment that does not factor into most policymakers’ prescription for economic growth and compensatory payments.
即使在活动人士抵制和政府过度监管给研发工作造成很大障碍的情况下，世界不少地方的抗旱转基因作物品种仍然在研发系统中脱颖而出。	Even with research and development hampered by resistance from activists and excessive government regulation, drought-resistant GE crop varieties are emerging from the development pipeline in many parts of the world.
其他气候学家则更加乐观：他们指出，如果我们让大气二氧化碳上升至450 ppm，并由此带来2摄氏度的气温升高，我们仍有66.6%的机会避免灾难。	Other climate scientists are more optimistic: they argue that if we allow atmospheric CO2 to rise to 450 ppm, a level associated with a two-degree Celsius temperature rise, we have a 66.6% chance of avoiding catastrophe.
近80国已经通过一项执行联合��安理会第1325号决议的国家行动计划，该决议全面制定了女性参与安全政策方方面面的蓝图。	Nearly 80 countries have adopted a National Action Plan to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, which sets forth a blueprint for engaging women in all aspects of security policy.
这些手段均已进入了实施阶段，且中国领导人似乎下定了决心要推行能让中国人民和整个亚洲都能从中获益的新的增长战略。	All of these measures are already underway, and Chinese leaders appear committed to embracing a new growth strategy that will benefit both China’s population and Asia as a whole.
诚然，清算所能带来诸多好处，包括更大的透明度，更准确的定价以及更好的监管目标，我们要使得这些具有操作性。	Yes, clearinghouses offer many benefits, including greater transparency, better pricing, and better regulatory focus, and we should try to make them viable.
任何区域安全体制都将不得不以中东成为一个没有大规模毁灭性武器 — — 包括核武器，化学和生物武器 — — 的区域为前提。	Any regional security architecture will have to be premised on the Middle East becoming a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.
美国国会肯定是一无所知的；其成员仍然忙于为政府支持的住房抵押贷款机构 — — 房利美和房地美 — — 四处游说，从而把危机推向更深处。	Certainly the US Congress was clueless; its members were still busy lobbying for the government-backed housing-mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, thereby digging the hole deeper.
在21世纪的技术进步和全球化背景下，这场全球讨论中依然存在着一个关键问题，那就是在讨论过程中似乎依然在很大程度上将治理和公共政策视为民族国家的专属地盘。	A crucial problem for this global debate is that, despite the realities of twenty-first-century technology and globalization, it is still conducted largely as if governance and public policy were almost exclusively the domain of the nation-state.
英国民众投票脱欧，而且政治领袖坚称将尊重公投结果，因此要求他们尽快完成脱欧程序算不上是什么“惩罚 ” 。	The United Kingdom’s citizens voted to leave, and its political leaders insist that they will respect the referendum’s outcome, so it is not “punishment” to insist that they do so as soon as possible.
而Xtify要面对的挑战则是软件的推广问题；用户需要在他们的手机上安装特定的软件，才能让从指甲修饰师到机场按摩师的其他人找到你。	Xtify’s challenge will be to get distribution; users will need to add the app to their cell phone in order to be targeted by anyone from a manicurist to an airport massage booth.
斯坦福—美国总统特朗普自称“史上最伟大”经济是他的功劳，动辄用今天的经济情况与奥巴马在任期间的历史性萎靡复苏相比。	STANFORD – US President Donald Trump claims credit for “the greatest ever” economy, and constantly contrasts economic conditions today with the historically weak recovery under President Barack Obama.
经济和金融加速全球化且相关增长模式几乎不容置疑的日子已经一去不复返了，我们也正处在一个存在高度科技和政治流动性的时代。	Gone are the days when accelerating economic and financial globalization and correlated growth patterns went almost unquestioned. We are also in an era of considerable technological and political fluidity.
美国国会的冥顽不化导致基金组织错过了一个在其他大多数国家都批准了决议的情况下强化自身资金实力的机会。	Congressional obstinacy is forcing the Fund to miss out on an opportunity to strengthen its finances at a time when most other countries have already approved the initiative.
但在中国的7.7亿劳动力大军中，这五种行业合计来也只雇用了1400万人而已，少于他们十年前的雇用人数。	Yet these five industries combined employ only 14 million people out of a total labor force of 770 million and fewer people than they did a decade ago.
纽约—英国艺术家达米恩·赫斯特（Damien Hirst）曾把2001年对纽约世贸中心的袭击称为“一种独立艺术。	NEW YORK – The British artist Damien Hirst once referred to the 2001 attack on New York’s World Trade Center as “kind of an artwork in its own right.
比如，在核能被排除的情况下，如今德国想要兑现其遏制气候变化的承诺，只能通过伤害 — — 并有可能失去 — — 部分工业基础来实现。	With the nuclear phase-out, for example, Germany can now honor its commitments to combat climate change only by damaging, and perhaps losing, part of its industrial base.
欧洲难民危机 — — 或者更准确地说，是难民管理危机 — — 在2015年夏天达到顶峰，一年后，欧盟宣布情况已经得到控制。	A year after the European refugee crisis – or, more accurately, refugee-management crisis – peaked in the summer of 2015, the EU declared that the situation was under control.
专家们大谈“二次探底”衰退，但某些国家从来没有从第一次探底中恢复过来：希腊GDP已经连续三年下降了。	Pundits decry a “double-dip” recession, but in some countries the first dip never ended: Greek GDP has been dipping for three years.
当他说到“现代化”或“把事情带到二十一世纪”时，他设法暗示了一个陌生但具有吸引力的变化与平稳混合体。	When he speaks of “modernization,” or of “bringing things into the twenty-first century,” he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability.
也正因如此，英国保守党 — — 他们曾经对犹太民主持有不太友好的态度 — — 现在可以心安理得地谴责工党政客反犹。	And that is why British Tories, who once might have held less than friendly views of the Jewish people, can now in good conscience condemn Labour politicians as anti-Semites.
但最近，伦敦经济学院的约翰·范·里宁（John Van Reenen）指出，英国退出的经济理由在行动中难觅踪影。	But lately, as John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics recently put it, the economic case for Brexit has been largely missing in action.
共产党继而把暴力事件归咎于政治反对党，称其为“法西斯份子 ” ， 并指责罗马尼亚及摩尔多瓦境内的罗马尼亚民族统一势力。	In response, the Communists blamed the violence on the opposition political parties, which it called “fascists,” and on Romania and Romanian irredentists in Moldova.
为了确保今天和明天的工人能够获得信息时代的好处，我们就必须重新设计经济制度以刺激这些新型商品的创造。	To ensure that the workers of today and tomorrow are able to capture the benefits of the information age will require us to redesign our economic system to stimulate the creation of these new types of commodities.
尽管哈马斯对此次大选采取抵制态度，但许多哈马斯支持者表示还是会支持最能保护巴勒斯坦人民核心利益的候选人。	Although Hamas is boycotting the election, many Hamas sympathizers will vote for the candidate most committed to defending the Palestinians’ core demands.
如果失去了意义 — — 比如，如果民主理想和制度无法提供足够多的共同感和使命感 — — 人们就会到其他地方去寻找意义的感觉，有时候，这导致他们走上邪路。	If it is missing – if, say, democratic ideals and institutions are failing to provide a palpable enough sense of community and purpose – people seek a sense of meaning elsewhere, which in some cases leads them to malevolent causes.
他们成立了四个地区军事委员会，这有助于他们巩固领导权和对叙利亚广大地区的控制，特别是土耳其边境地区。	They have created four regional military councils, which have helped to consolidate leadership and solidify their control over significant areas of the country, particularly near the Turkish border.
纽约-为什么是法国、英国和美国的军舰满载着用于救助受到纳吉斯风暴袭击的灾民的食品和其他必需品停靠在缅甸海岸的附近，而不是中国或马来西亚的军舰呢？	NEW YORK – Why are French, British, and American warships, but not Chinese or Malaysian warships, sitting near the Burmese coast loaded with food and other necessities for the victims of Cyclone Nargis?
在这一危机时刻，IMF组织已经快速前进，为多个成员国提供了帮助，包括采用保护社会开支的方式来缓和危机对最易受伤者的影响。	The IMF has already moved quickly to help many of our member countries in this time of crisis, including by protecting social spending in order to cushion the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable.
美国需要有勇气推行平衡自由贸易方式的政治领袖，他们应当在倡导自由贸易长期利益的同时短期救济受损群体。	What Americans need are political leaders with the courage to pursue a balanced approach to free trade, championing its long-term benefits, while delivering short-term relief to those at risk of displacement.
但除去此类跟踪所涉及的公民自由问题外，任何一种技术都无法成功解决最根本的问题：那就是导致成百上千万人寻求避难的这场冲突。	Yet, aside from the civil-liberties problems with this kind of tracking, no technology can successfully address the underlying problem: the conflicts from which millions of people are seeking refuge.
在某种意义上说它们可能是对的，因为美洲国家组织大会的第二个值得关注之处则是墨西哥、巴西、智利和哥伦比亚这些拉美民主国家将如何行动。	They are probably right, up to a certain point, because the second lesson from the OAS assembly concerns the behavior of the Latin American democracies, mainly Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia.
而尽管难以想象全球经济发生更加混乱的事件，我们也难以知道意大利的前路会怎么走。 在欧元时代，意大利的人均收入实际上略有下降。	And, while it is hard to imagine a more chaotic event for the global economy, it is also hard to know the way forward for Italy, where per capita income has actually fallen slightly during the euro era.
在亚美尼亚，政府最近新成立了世界首个国家SDG创新实验室，这是一个为“加快”SDG实施而进行的合作项目。	In Armenia, the government recently created the world’s first national SDG innovation laboratory, a collaborative effort designed to “accelerate” SDG implementation.
从1985年到2005年的近20年时间里，世行一直拒绝使用已被证明效果良好的定向小地主支持项目以帮助贫困自耕农提高产量、走出贫困。	For around 20 years, roughly from 1985 to 2005, the Bank resisted the well-proven use of targeted support for small landholders to enable impoverished subsistence farmers to improve yields and break out of poverty.
但寻找、委任和接受独立法官的过程仍然困难重重、任重道远，特别是当执行伊斯兰教教法的权力仍旧归属教士而不是法官时更是如此。	But the task of finding, appointing, and accepting independent judges remains. It will be particularly difficult in an environment in which the sharia – that is, Islamic religious law administered not by judges but by priests – is never far away.
墨西哥石油公司曾经尝试把一种名叫“墨西哥宽边帽”的仪器放在“伊克斯托克”油井旁边收集海底的原油，但因为无法对仪器进行固定，所以计划最终没有成功。	Pemex tried to put a device called a “sombrero” over the Ixtoc leak to collect the oil at the ocean floor, but the plan failed because the structure could not be kept in place.
而原本应该代表这些股东利益的机构投资者（退休基金等等 ） ， 却由于利益、共事和熟稔，常常跟金融公司的CEO和管理层走得很近。	These shareholders are represented by institutional investors (pension funds, etc.) whose interests, agendas, and cozy relationships often align them more closely with firms’ CEOs and managers.
但他们绝不应该忽视算术约束，特别是在同一招数早就已经被用过 — — 并且带来了巨大的消极后果 — — 的时候。	But they shouldn’t be able to ignore the constraints of arithmetic, especially not when the same sleight of hand has been tried before – with profoundly adverse consequences.
尽管这个理由非常充分，但对现代监狱有了解的人却认定很多犯人并不那么容易悔过，他们这样的态度很难全部归咎于现有的关押条件。	But, while this is a compelling argument, those who know modern prisons recognize that many inmates are not susceptible to improvement – a fact that cannot be attributed only to conditions of detention.
私人激励与社会回报并不完美匹配：企业可以从增强器市场实力的创新中获益，使它们能够绕过监管或将本可能流向他人的租引导到自己囊中。	Private incentives are not well aligned with social returns: firms can gain from innovations that increase their market power, enable them to circumvent regulations, or channel rents that would otherwise accrue to others.
衰落中的国家 — — 比方说1914年的奥匈帝国 — — 往往更加危险，因为他们规避风险的意愿较弱。	States in decline – think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 – tend to become less risk-averse and thus much more dangerous.
问题的关键是在于这一协议将违背脱盟论者所有的本意（以及说辞 ） ， 因为这将意味着接受欧盟的“四大自由 ” ： 不仅是商品，服务和资本的自由流动 — — 还包括人。	The point is that such a deal would go against all the instincts (and rhetoric) of the Brexiteers, because it would mean accepting the EU’s “four freedoms”: not just the free movement of goods, services, and capital – but of people, too.
人们用它来形容奥巴马的美国新政，特别是与伊朗关系，至少在去年夏天伊朗备受争议的大选和随之而来的国内危机恶化之前“接触”是主基调。	It was used to describe Obama’s new American diplomacy, particularly with regard to Iran, at least until the disputed elections in Iran last summer and the worsening domestic crisis that has ensued.
仅中国中央电视台（CCTV）一家就拥有12个频道（许多频道全天24小时播放节目）和近3000名雇员。	China Central Television (CCTV) alone has 12 channels (many broadcasting 24 hours a day), and employs about 3,000 people.
但这不是一个其他地方的决策者和企业家可以模仿的创造就业和包容性增长的模式 — — 至少在做出一些根本性调整之前是如此。	But it is not a model for job creation and inclusive growth that policymakers and entrepreneurs elsewhere can emulate – at least not without making some fundamental adjustments.
从国际能源机构搜集的经合组织国家2010年1~4月核能发电数据来看，各月数据都与去年同期持平或更低。	Early results for the first four months of 2010 for the OECD countries, collected by the International Energy Agency indicate that so far the 2010 results are as low or lower than during the last year.
中国人大常委会罕见地介入“说明”基本法第104条，宣布所有官员就职宣誓必须“准确、完整、庄重、真诚 ” 。	In an extraordinary move, China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee stepped in to “clarify” Article 104 of the Basic Law, declaring that all oaths taken by office-holders must be “solemn, accurate, complete, and sincere.”
贸易谈判进展缓慢的主要原因并不是贸易保护主义的日渐增加；而是因为进一步自由化导致的复杂权衡取舍无法再被非常庞大的潜在利益所抵消。	The main reason for slow progress in trade negotiations is not increasing protectionism; it is the fact that further liberalization entails complex trade-offs no longer offset by very large potential benefits.
最终，面对反对财政巩固政策的政治阻力（尤其是在美国 ） ， 一个可能的风险就是各国政府会以持续铸币的做法来规避这些阻力。	Finally, in the face of political opposition to fiscal consolidation, especially in the US, there is a risk that the path of least resistance becomes continued monetization of fiscal deficits.
美国为世界带来了自由、规则基础下的多边主义思想 — — 这一机制的缺点凸显出该体系运行所依据的傲慢原则。	The United States gave the world the doctrine of liberal, rule-based multilateralism – a regime whose many blemishes highlight the lofty principles according to which the system has generally functioned.
国际货币基金组织和各国中央银行应当相互协调，以短期信贷的形式向受到资本流入和出口收入减少影响的新兴市场国家提供流动资金。	The International Monetary Fund and central banks should increase liquidity in a coordinated fashion in the form of short-term credit to emerging-market economies suffering from cuts in capital inflows and export earnings.
虽然他在1996年就当选巴勒斯坦立法委员会，但是他声名大振还是在2000年9月开始的因提法达起义中。	Although he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 1996, Barghouti’s reputation soared when the current Intifada began in September 2000.
可是，根据麦肯锡咨询公司提供的数据，没有清偿的信用卡信贷正在快速增长，2004年同比增长了四倍，占国民生产总值0.18 % 。	However, outstanding credit on cards is growing, more than quadrupling year on year in 2004, to 0.18% of GDP, according to the consulting firm McKinsey.
全球而言，据估计我们的农业系统产生了温室气体总排量的14 % ； 若将与毁林间接相关的排放和与化肥生产有关的排放也包括进来，这一比例将增加到24 % 。	Worldwide, our industrial agriculture system produces an estimated 14% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions; including emissions indirectly linked to deforestation, and those associated with fertilizer production, increases that share to 24%.
即使在今天，欧元区关键成员仍显然认为自己在隔岸观火，狭隘的国家观念正在欧盟死灰复燃，变革的渴望似乎正在熄灭。	Even today, with the eurozone’s essential players apparently convinced that they are out of the woods, national narrow-mindedness is experiencing a revival in the EU, and the desire for change seems to be slackening.
在刚刚过去的9月，政府间气候变化委员会（Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change）报告说海洋正在变暖，海水正在变酸，氧气浓度正在下降。	In late September, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that the oceans are warming, seawater is acidifying, and oxygen concentrations are dropping.
在美国，总统乔治W·布什的加强社会安全委员会（Commission to Strengthen Social Security）在它的声明中引用Siegel的话，政府应该鼓励人们投资股市。	In the United States, President George W. Bush’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security cited Siegel for its claim that the government should encourage people to invest in stocks.
但稳定局势方面的进展进一步凸显出俄国从未解决的问题，虽然始作俑者不是全球金融危机，但这些问题在全球金融危机中却变得更为严重。	But progress on stabilization only highlighted Russia’s unresolved problems, which the global financial crisis exacerbated, but did not cause.
美国共和党、英国保守党和共党，以及新领袖劳伦·弗基耶（Laurent Wauquiez）领导下的法国共和党都是如此。	This has been proven by Republicans in the United States, Conservatives and Labourites in the United Kingdom, and Les Républicains under the new leadership of Laurent Wauquiez in France.
一位名叫莫洛佐夫（Valery Morozov）的俄罗斯商人批评者指出，普金本人办公室的官员也要求吃合同回扣。	One critic, a Russian businessman named Valery Morozov, claims that officials in Putin’s own office demanded payoffs for contracts.
我引用了克鲁格曼此前的文章证明，首先，克鲁格曼在其经济评论中一再声称的“无往而不准”的东西是错误的。	By quoting his past writings, I showed, first, that Krugman’s repeated claims to have been “right about everything” in his economic commentary are false.
美联储主席本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke）所提到的“全球储蓄过量”概念经常被用来解释世界各地利率下降的状况。	US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s notion of a “global savings glut” is a commonly cited explanation for falling world interest rates.
事实上，按照纽约大学法学院和斯坦福大学法学院研究员在近期报告中的说法，在无人机目标区域生活的民众出现全面的恐怖化。	Indeed, according to a recent report by researchers at New York University School of Law and Stanford Law School, the people in the areas targeted by the drone campaign are being systematically terrorized.
但在7鱼粉，特朗普宣布了新一轮关税，目标新增价值2,000亿美元的中国商品，或对美出口总额的15 % 。	But in July, Trump announced a new round of tariffs targeting an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, representing about 15% of total exports to the US.
夏天来临之前那场关于我们是否面对一个低增长“新常态”的问题已经不复存在，因为已经没有任何东西能维持常态了。	The pre-summer debate about whether we faced a “new normal” of slower growth has been resolved: nothing now looks normal.
在阿根廷，当局与一小撮“投资者 ” （ 所谓的兀鹫基金）之间的缠斗阻碍了绝大多数阿根廷债权人自愿同意的完全债务重组方案。	In Argentina, the authorities’ battles with a small number of “investors” (so-called vulture funds) jeopardized an entire debt restructuring agreed to – voluntarily – by an overwhelming majority of the country’s creditors.
事实上，几个月来，美国和阿富汗政府进行了痛苦的谈判以确定可以让美国几乎无限制地在阿富汗保留军事基地的安全协议。	Indeed, for several months, the US has been involved in painstaking negotiations with the Afghan government to conclude a bilateral security agreement that would enable the US to maintain bases in Afghanistan virtually indefinitely.
但从这个角度看2008年全球金融危机前的长期停滞假说与核心事实不符：全球增长平均达到了4%以上，是有记录以来的最高值。	But from that perspective, the hypothesis of secular stagnation in the period leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis is at odds with a central fact: global growth averaged more than 4% – the highest rate on record.
其区别在于中国推行了结构性 — — 因此也会延续长时期 — — 的以信贷为基础的政策，而其他新兴经济体则陷入了一场周期性的贷款狂热。	The difference is that China has implemented structural – and thus longer-lasting – credit-based policies, while other emerging economies have been drawn into a cyclical lending binge.
这主要（尽管不完全）是欧洲殖民者的过错，在帝国主义的垂死挣扎中，这些殖民者建立了许多成熟后注定要解体的人为的国家。	This is largely, though not entirely, the fault of the European colonialists who, in the death throes of their own empires, created artificial states ripening for dissolution.
事实上，作为国际货币基金组织主要收入来源的公共资源账户(GRA)贷款的空前下降，迫使国际货币基金组织在2008年4月份宣布了一项1亿美元的支出削减计划。	Indeed, the unprecedented decline in GRA lending, the IMF’s main source of income, forced the Fund to announce a $100 million cost-cutting plan in April 2008.
2月，厄瓜多尔总统科雷亚宣布，如果古巴总统劳尔·卡斯特罗不能获邀参会，ALBA国家（古巴、委内瑞拉、厄瓜多尔、尼加拉瓜、玻利维亚和一些加勒比岛国）也不会与会。	In February, Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, declared that if Cuban President Raúl Castro were not invited to the Summit, the ALBA countries (Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and some of the Caribbean islands) would not attend.
这种崩盘的原因或许是金融公司内部混乱的监控，在政府潜在的担保下，过于慷慨给与冒险者的巨大经济回报；或许是经过长期的幸运之后，大家都变得过于乐观；或许简单地归结于大家一种非理性的恐慌行为。	To buy – or even to hold – risky assets in such a situation is a recipe for financial disaster. So is buying or holding equity in firms that may be holding risky assets, regardless of how “safe” a firm’s stock was previously thought to be.
她说出了一个基本事实 — — 她对世界公民权的驳斥充分说明了我们，世界金融、政治和技术官僚精英，如何与我们的同胞拉开了距离，失去了他们的信任。	It contains an essential truth – the disregard of which says much about how we – the world’s financial, political, and technocratic elite – distanced ourselves from our compatriots and lost their trust.
到去年9月，印度《经济时报 》 （ Economic Times）报道，出于这一风险，大部分年轻印度政客在社交网站上并不活跃。	As recently as last September, India’s Economic Times reported that, faced with such risks, most young Indian politicians were not active on any social-networking site.
在美国，2008年的预算赤字占美国GDP的5.8 % ， 根据同一份OECD预测报告，在2009年会达到GDP的10.2 % ， 这一比例就 变成和德国一样的了，即GDP的4.4 % 。	In the United States, the budget deficit in 2008 stood at 5.8% of GDP, and, according to the same OECD forecast, will amount to 10.2% of GDP in 2009, which translates into exactly the same economic stimulus as in Germany, 4.4% of GDP.
即便互联网和通讯技术在技术上让公开喊话变得比以往任何时候都更加容易，但无处不在的国家和商业监控确保了言论、结社和游行仍然受到约束。	Even as the Internet and communications technology have made speaking up publicly technically easier than ever, ubiquitous state and commercial surveillance has ensured that expression, association, and protest remain constrained.
事实上，如果工业化国家兑现一代人以前所做的承诺，做好阻止气候变化所需要事，缅甸和越南极有可能根本不会蒙受最近的“损失和伤害 ” 。	In fact, if the industrialized world had done what was needed to stop climate change, as promised a generation ago, Myanmar and Vietnam most likely would have been spared their recent “loss and damage.”
而且，它们在原则上没有什么明显可以辨别的区别可以让人们合理地预计其中一个政党的经济表现要优于另一个。	Nor are there clearly identifiable differences in doctrine that should translate into a reasonable expectation of better economic performance under one party than the other.
影片尚未发行 ， 《 帕德玛瓦蒂》便占据了无数新闻媒体头条，还在晚间新闻档掀起了各种争论，遭到各种歇斯底里的暴力威胁，四个印度人民党执政的邦甚至禁止它上映。	Despite not even having been released, “Padmavati” has already inspired countless front-page stories and debates on the evening news, hysterical threats of violence, and a ban in four states governed by India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
对未来的预期被这些深层次、多维度的因素影响，也许美国、欧洲和其他国家选民对体制表现出愤怒也就不足为奇了。	With expectations about the future being undermined by such deep-rooted and multifaceted forces, perhaps it should not be surprising that voters in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are expressing anger toward the establishment.
Lantos对此深有体会：年幼的他正是在Raoul Wallenberg的援救之下才摆脱了被布达佩斯的纳粹送入奥斯威辛集中营的厄运。	Lantos knows about moral compasses: as a boy, he was rescued by Raoul Wallenberg from being deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis in Budapest.
关税的最后关键支持者是美国贸易代表罗伯特·莱希泽（Robert Lighthizer ） ， 他以前曾在钢铁行业担任过律师。	A final key supporter of the tariffs is US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who formerly worked as a lawyer for the steel industry.
民主党方面，支持自称为民主社会主义者的伯尼·桑德斯的大批人群同样主要受到所谓经济不公的驱动（桑德斯已经注意到这群人中可能同时有特朗普的支持者 ） 。	On the Democratic side, the huge crowds turning up for the self-described Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders are also motivated largely by perceived economic injustice (creating a possible overlap – which Sanders has noted – with Trump supporters).
到目前为止，G20的呼吁已从“全球着眼”变成了“本国着手 ” 。 我们希望，G20领导人能在戛纳进行系统的思考，从本国出发，相互合作，扫除全球信用泛滥雷区。	So far, the G-20’s call to “think globally” has turned into “act locally.” We hope that the G-20 leaders will think systemically at Cannes, and act nationally and cooperatively to defuse the global credit glut minefield.
如果本地银行遭遇挤兑，或者公司难以延展债务，它们就必须能够从本地央行借到美元，而本地央行又只能从美联储获得美元。	If local banks suffer a run, or if corporations have trouble rolling over their debt, they need to be able to borrow dollars from the local central bank, which in turn may have no choice but to get those dollars from the Fed.
在阿根廷，拥有顽强生命力的庇隆正义党政策已经模糊了左右翼之间的鸿沟，该党于20世纪90年代推行了国企私有化，但后来又将企业重新收归国有。	In Argentina, the left-right divide has been blurred by the policies of the hydra-headed Perónist Justicialist Party, which privatized state companies in the 1990s, only to re-nationalize them later.
欧洲实际的经济增长是非常出色的，这归功于低廉的油价、很低的实际利率、坚实的收益和强劲的增长势头，并且在增长顶点到来以及通货膨胀压力显现之前还会一直很好地保持下去。	Europe’s actual economic growth has been quite good and – thanks to low gas prices, low real interest rates, solid profits, and strong growth momentum – promises to get better before the ceiling is hit and inflationary pressures set in.
但是，将动用的七千亿美元可能流入一个竹篮子里，而且世界各政府拿出的数以亿计的资金也可能落得如此下场。	But the $700 billion to be used may flow into a leaky bucket, and so may the billions provided by governments throughout the world.
在2011年，欧盟启动了塞尔维亚和科索沃之间的对话，并随之带来了行动自由、贸易自由、经济机会、安全、公正、互联互通以及其他许多方面的重大利益。	In 2011, the EU initiated a dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo that has since produced significant benefits in terms of freedom of movement, trade, economic opportunities, security, justice, connectivity, and much else.
比如，我们知道为了对抗经济停滞应该降低利率并注入流动性，而且应该提高政策利率和银行存款准备金率以抑制通胀。	For example, we know that we should lower interest rates and inject liquidity to fight stagnation, and that we should raise policy rates and banks’ cash-reserve ratios to stifle inflation.
这一三方自贸协议也有助于稳定三国互相之间麻烦不断的政治关系，并为朝鲜最终的经济结构调整提供一个更优质的环境。	A trilateral FTA would also most likely contribute to stabilizing the three countries’ troublesome political relations with each other, and could provide a better environment for North Korea’s eventual economic reconstruction.
由伊朗激进分子、美以公共事务委员会、沙特领导的逊尼派联盟、以色列政府和美国两党政客所组成的奇怪联盟已经迫使奥巴马政府承诺进一步制裁伊朗资助恐怖主义的活动。	An odd coalition of Iranian radicals, AIPAC, the Saudi-led Sunni alliance, the Israeli government, and US politicians from both parties have already compelled Obama to promise additional sanctions on Iran for its sponsorship of terrorism.
但卫生部一直无力为所有这些新设施配置设备并支付人员和运作费用，因为预算并未上升到足以配合系统扩张的水平。	The Ministry of Health has been unable to equip all of these new facilities and cover staff and operational costs, as its budget has not risen to match the system’s expansion.
过去的经验表明，真实率将至少升至2 % ， 即使通胀预期继续维持在2 % ， 总名义利率也将升至4%以上。	Past experience implies that the real rate will rise to at least 2%, taking the total nominal interest rate to more than 4%, even if expected inflation remains at just 2%.
即使这些群体规模相对较小，但在于贸易自由化对抗的过程中，他们表现出极强的纪律和团结，这能大大增加他们的政治影响力 — — 特别是如果某权势政治人物站在他们这一边的话。	Even if these groups are relatively small, the discipline and unity with which they fight trade liberalization can amplify their political influence considerably – especially if a powerful political figure takes up their cause.
两个没有协调的撤军，即从南黎巴嫩(占领22年后工党决定)以及从加沙(占领39年后利库德集团决定)撤军证明，不能简单地撤离某个地区并把它抛在脑后。	Both the uncoordinated withdrawals from south Lebanon (by the Labor party after 22 years of occupation) and from Gaza (by Likud after 39 years of occupation) proved that you can’t simply evacuate an area and forget about it.
有些生态系统服务 — — 包括清洁的空气和水、缓解洪水或干旱等极端气候事件和自然的消遣性用途 — — 根本就无法进口。	Some ecosystem services – including clean air and water, mitigation of extreme climate events such as floods or droughts, and recreational uses of nature – simply cannot be imported.
因此，各国政府必须与私人部门行动方建立创新合作模式，同时认识到能源作为一种公共品必须接受恰当的监管和监督。	That is why governments must build innovative partnerships with private-sector actors, while recognizing that energy, as a public good, must be subject to appropriate regulation and oversight.
但是，就在肯尼亚民主制度可以成为这面明镜的最大受益者的同时，在历史上坚持这样做的人现在却相信他们别无选择，只能镇压。	And yet, just when the country’s democratic institutions could most benefit from such a mirror, those who have historically held it up now believe they have no alternative but to put it down.
在伊朗，现政权仍在继续推进，但显然因经济危机（很大程度上是国际制裁的结果 ） 、 群众示威和内部分裂而受到了削弱，并因此变得十分好斗。	In Iran, the regime pushes ahead, but is clearly being hurt by an economic crisis (largely a consequence of international sanctions), popular protest, and internal bickering – and has turned bellicose as a result.
传统外交强调与国家和政府的关系多于与反对派或民间组织（即便它们明确存在）的关系，因此为自身发展带来了难以逾越的障碍。	By emphasizing the relations between states and governments over contacts with the opposition or civil societies (when they exist in an identifiable form), traditional diplomacy has created for itself a handicap that is difficult to overcome.
自杀现象屡见不鲜，暴力犯罪的性质也在悄然发生变化，新型非理性和无关自身利益的暴力行为变得越来越普遍。	Suicide became common, and the nature of violent crime changed, with a new type – irrational and unconnected to self-interest – becoming increasingly prevalent.
“重夺控制权”的矛头同时也直指位于卢森堡的欧洲法院，按照欧盟公约规定，其判决的效力超过各国本国法院。	“Getting back control” was also directed against the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg, whose judgments, by convention, have precedence over judgments by national courts.
过去五年来，欧盟面临着一系列看似无穷无尽的考验，包括波及整个欧元区的金融危机、俄罗斯入侵乌克兰、希腊重现违约担忧以及英国退出欧盟的隐患。	Over the last five years, it has confronted a seemingly endless series of tests, including a eurozone-wide financial crisis, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, renewed fears of a Greek default, and the prospect of a British exit.
大多数美国人都支持提高最低工资，有7位诺贝尔经济学奖得主也表示赞成；希望硅谷的那些全民基本收入倡导者们也能如此。	A majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage, as do seven Nobel laureates in economics; one hopes that Silicon Valley’s UBI proselytizers do, too.
（如果你需要一个小物件，那么只要是这个物件都符合你的要求；但如果你有了物件94303，那么只有零件94303A才符合你的要求。 ）	(If you want a widget, any widget will do, but once you have widget 94303, only part 94303A will satisfy you.)
如果土耳其成为欧盟成员国，那么欧洲从经济和军事上都能得到加强，而如果土耳其满足了包括言论自由在内的政治标准，那么它应该获得和其他成员国一致的准入谈判。	Europe would strengthen itself economically and militarily if Turkey became a member, and it should revive accession negotiations on the same basis as other member states if Turkey meets the political criteria, including press freedom.
危机对墨西哥而言曾经是家常便饭（虽然危机已有近20年未在墨西哥上演 ） ； 但危机爆发时总统任期往往接近尾声。	Mexico was once accustomed to crises (even if it hasn’t had one for 20 years); but they typically erupted at the end of a presidential term.
此外，事实上，一个不容否认的事实是弗里德曼的药方被证明并不足以应对大衰退 — — 这强烈地表明如果在大衰退期间使用，其效果也可能远远不够。	And, indeed, there can be no denying the fact that Friedman’s cure proved to be an inadequate response to the Great Recession – strongly suggesting that it would have fallen similarly short had it been tried during the Great Depression.
数据的产生量将出现剧烈增长，再加上各行业不断扩张的应用，有理由期待个体数据价值很快就会超过100美元/互联网用户。	Given the dramatic growth in the amount of data being generated, together with ever-expanding applications across industries, it is reasonable to expect that individual data will soon be worth more than $100 per Internet user.
巴黎 — — 八国集团、五国集团、二十国集团、两国集团、三国集团，现在又是十四国集团（八国集团加五国集团再加埃及 ） ： 世界秩序的“数学题”从来没有比今天更混乱、更复杂。	PARIS – G-8, G-5, G-20, G-2, G-3, and now the G-14 (the G-8 plus the G-5 plus Egypt): never have the “mathematics” of world order seemed more complex and confusing.
不知什么原因，获取达致完全就业的投资水平似乎需要实际负利率（排除通胀）才能实现，以致出现某种说法，认为必须先发钱给人们然后能产生投资。	For some reason, achieving a level of investment that would generate full employment seems to require negative real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates, which is another way of saying that people have to be paid to invest.
考虑到国家安全，空气和水的质量，以及单纯的经济效益方面的原因，中国领导人已经渴望控制高能耗高污染的工业了。	China’s leaders are already eager to rein in energy- and pollution-intensive industry for reasons of national security, air and water quality, and simple economic efficiency.
其中一个主要范例就是耳道假丝酵母菌（Candida auris）这种正在凸显成为全球严峻健康威胁的多药耐药性真菌感染。	A prime example is Candida auris, a multidrug-resistant fungal infection that is emerging as a serious global health threat.
泛阿拉伯报纸《生活报 》 （ Al-Hayat）华盛顿记者站主任乔伊斯·卡兰（Joyce Karam）认为其原因在于“穆斯林杀害穆斯林或阿拉伯人杀害阿拉伯人比以色列杀害阿拉伯人更容易接受 。 ”	Joyce Karam, the Washington bureau chief of the Pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat, believes that this is because “Muslim killing Muslim or Arab killing Arab seems more acceptable than Israel killing Arabs.”
这是因为我们一直几乎完全把抗生素看成是一种消费品 — — 我们要求医生给我们开出处方，并在我们感到合适的时候停药。	That is because we have come to regard antibiotics almost as consumer goods – ours to demand from doctors, and ours to take or stop taking as we see fit.
在法国，新上台的中左翼政府也面临着挑战：一方面要兑现自己增强社会团结的承诺，另一方面又得持续减少预算赤字。	In France, the new center-left government faces the challenge of delivering on its promise of strengthening social solidarity while substantially reducing the budget deficit.
贸易规则应进行更新，以反映1995年世贸组织成立以来市场和政策的转变，特别是要反映新兴经济体与日俱增的重要性。	Trade rules need to be updated to reflect the market and policy shifts that have occurred – particularly the increasing importance of emerging economies – since the WTO was established in 1995.
而今天，多亏卫星、气象气球、超级计算机和经验丰富的气象预报人士，我们提前一个星期就能预见灾害性天气的到来。	Today, thanks to satellites, weather balloons, supercomputers, and skilled forecasters, we can anticipate hazardous weather up to a week in advance.
俄罗斯天然气工业公司已经完全占有了土耳其市场、对乌克兰断气、威胁对白俄罗斯断气以及为愿意成为其合作伙伴的国家如意大利提供优惠的市场准入。	Gazprom has flooded the market in Turkey, withheld gas in Ukraine, threatened to do so in Belarus, and offered preferential market access to willing partners, such as Italy.
来自可口可乐和阿迪达斯的巨额企业资金涌入这个系统，流入第三世界当权者以及（据说）阿维兰热本人贪得无厌的腰包中。	Huge amounts of corporate money from Coca-Cola and Adidas went sloshing through the system, all the way to the roomy pockets of Third World potentates and, allegedly, of Havelange himself.
跟在硅谷屁股后面的经济规划者和决策者正渐渐明白他们并不总能复制那里正在蓬勃发展的创业文化和融资机制。	The economic planners and policymakers who are chasing Silicon Valley’s taillights are learning that they cannot always replicate the entrepreneurial culture and finance mechanisms that flourish there now.
该地区女权活动家们决不能陷入打着民族主义和领土争端招牌的陷阱而被洗脑，并沦为政治家手中的又一个的工具。	Women’s rights activists in the region should not fall into a brainwashing trap of nationalism and territorial disputes, becoming another tool in the hands of politicians.
俄罗斯周日议会选举的赢家在意料之中：弗拉基米尔•普京为首的统一俄罗斯党。 同样毫无悬念的是，普京将在2012年3月举行的总统大选中获胜。	Unlike Europe, beset by a sovereign-debt crisis, and the United States, whose leaders are wrangling over how to stem the deficit, Russia may look like an oasis of stability and continuity.
埃及当时的总统安瓦尔·萨达特允许流亡国外的伊朗国王定居埃及，并在伊拉克与伊朗伊斯兰共和国的八年战争中对伊拉克予以支持。	Egypt’s then-president, Anwar El Sadat, granted the exiled Shah of Iran permission to live in Egypt, and supported Iraq in its eight-year war with the Islamic Republic.
同样地，强大的城市化动力继续为中国的高投资经济提供坚固的支持，同时让相对贫穷的农民工能够通过在城市找到收入更高的工作来增加自身的收入。	Likewise, a powerful urbanization dynamic continues to deliver solid support for China’s high-investment economy, while enabling relatively poor rural workers to raise their incomes by finding higher-paying jobs in the cities.
在美国，妓女在工作场所被杀害的机率是妇女从事的第二危险的工作 — — 在酒类专卖店的工作 — — 的51倍。	In the United States, the rate at which prostitutes are killed in the workplace is 51 times that of the next most dangerous occupation for women, working in a liquor store.
但是布什政府可以寻求办法来遏制全球的能源价格，而这应该首先从拒绝被伊朗总统内贾德引诱进他随心所欲地逐步增强的紧张局势开始。	But the Bush administration can seek ways to contain global energy prices – and it should begin by refusing to be baited into escalating tensions whenever Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pleases.
美国总统德怀特·艾森豪威尔曾在1960年的国情咨文中简明扼要地表达了这一观点：实现盈余去偿还债务可以极有必要地“减少孩子们从我们这继承的贷款 ” 。	US President Dwight Eisenhower expressed this thought succinctly in his State of the Union message in 1960: generating a surplus to pay back debt was a necessary “reduction on our children’s inherited mortgage.”
生产率提高60%可以让每年的产出增加1.6万亿美元 — — 大约相当于一个加拿大经济 — — 让全球GDP增加2 % 。	A 60% increase in productivity would create an additional $1.6 trillion in annual output – roughly the equivalent of the Canadian economy – and add 2% to global GDP.
让我们来看一下国家应该通过税收以公共的方式还是应该通过健康保险和病人付费以个人的方式来给健康护理注资的问题。	Consider the issue of whether countries should fund health care publicly, through taxes, or privately, through health insurance and user fees.

2015年12月，美联储将隔夜利率仅仅提高了0.25 % ， 2016年12月可能再次仅仅提高25个基点。	The Fed increased the overnight rate by just 0.25% in December 2015 and is likely to add just another 25 basis points in December 2016.
自1993年以来，我们与近3,300个储蓄组织的73,000多位妇女进行了合作，为需要它们的妇女直接提供服务。	Since 1993, we have worked with more than 73,000 women in nearly 3,300 savings groups, bringing services directly to the women who need them.
令人遗憾的是，在唐纳德·特朗普总统领导下，美国政府及其监管机构已经完全掌握在化石燃料游说团体的手中，而欧盟仍在与煤炭生产国就何时以及以何种方式淘汰煤炭争论不休。	Regrettably, under President Donald Trump, the US government and its regulatory agencies are entirely in the hands of the fossil-fuel lobby, while the EU bickers with its coal-producing member states about how and when to phase out coal.
波兰外交部长路托斯特·瓦斯基科夫斯基（Witold Waszczykowski）指出 ， “ 骑自行车和吃素的欧洲 ” ， 及其天真的政治正确和自由主义文化，是一个威胁而非榜样。	As Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski put it, the “Europe of cyclists and vegetarians,” with its naive culture of political correctness and liberalism, represents a threat, not a model.
要想在星期一早晨有机会重新开张，破产银行的数十亿美元长期债务需要事先组织，从而让破产法院能够在周末消除它。	To have any chance of re-opening on Monday morning, a bankrupt bank’s billions of dollars in long-term debt would already have to be structured in such a way that a bankruptcy court could eliminate it over a weekend.
学术研究表明人均收入较高、收入差距较低且生育率较低的国家倾向于更多投资于子女教育，其公共支出导致入学率升高。	Academic research suggests that countries with higher per capita income, lower income inequality, and lower fertility rates tend to invest more in children’s education, with public expenditure leading to higher enrollment rates.
政府可以做到这些 — — 还能确保银行将偿还贷款（通过要求优质抵押品实现 ） ， 或者金融业整体能够覆盖贷款偿还额（多德-弗兰克法案授权并要求这样做 ） 。	The government can do that – and it can make sure that either the bank will repay the loans (by getting good collateral) or that the financial sector overall will cover the repayment (as Dodd-Frank authorized and required).
尽管联合国政府间气候变化工作小组已经确定了二氧化碳排放的年人均目标，我们仍然不清楚大气中不同含量的温室气体将在多大程度上导致变暖的结果。	Despite the IPCC’s target for annual per capita CO2 emissions, we still do not know how much warming various levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause.
尽管前瞻性指引是现代央行行长工具箱中颇为有用的组成部分，但在伦敦出现的这个盎格鲁-加拿大版本相当的复杂，这主要是因为它是被强行塞入一个为了其他目的设计的政策框架内的。	Though forward guidance is a useful part of the modern central banker’s tool kit, the Anglo-Canadian version on display in London is highly complex, mainly because it has been shoehorned into a policy framework designed for another purpose.
俄罗斯总统普京在全世界面前所保有的些许道德和政治立场也将蒸发殆尽，他很快就会在即将于圣彼得堡召开的G20峰会上发现这一点。	What little moral and political standing Russian President Vladimir Putin has retained in the rest of the world is also evaporating, as he will soon discover at the upcoming G-20 Summit in Saint Petersburg.
我们必须以克制和审慎 — — 而不是以反射性的“否 ” — —解决军事手段是否确保政治解决方案的必要条件这一难题。	"We must address, with restraint and prudence – rather than with a reflexive “nein"" – the difficult question of whether military means are necessary to safeguard political solutions."
3月中旬，人行宣布人民币/美元汇率日间运动区间幅度从±1%扩大到±2 % ， 以进一步打击热钱投机者的积极性。	In mid-March, the PBOC announced that the daily movement in the renminbi/dollar rate would be increased from ±1% to ±2%, to further dampen hot-money speculators’ enthusiasm.
通过这项计划，总统有权无偿向任何国家转移国会已向政府拨款的国防物资，只要接受国被认为对美国的安全至关重要。	Through that program, the president could transfer defense materials for which Congress had appropriated funds to the government of any country whose defense was considered vital to US security, without requiring compensation.
这些创新让我们越来越接近实现联合国在消除贫困、消除医疗不平等、提高入学普及、遏制全球变暖等关键问题上的可持续发展目标。	Innovations like these bring us closer to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on issues like eradicating poverty, ending health-care inequality, increasing access to schooling, and combating global warming.
现在的问题仍然是Bashar是否明白和平不仅仅关乎收复戈兰高地，也有赖于和以色列关系的正常化，而这一点正是他的父亲所抗拒的。	The question remains whether Bashar understands that peace is not only about regaining the Golan, but also about normalization of relations with Israel, which his father was reluctant to allow.
当然，如此激烈的竞争会腐蚀企业的利润 — — 这一影响可以通过用互联网科技整合后台运行和物流来抵消。	Of course, such intense competition will erode firms’ profit margins – a trend that they can offset by integrating Internet technologies into back-office functions and logistics.

任何由联合国部队解除真主党武装的企图都将意味着同真主党(以及背后的叙利亚和伊朗)的战争。 联合国部队无法完成这一任务。	Any attempt at disarming Hezbollah by the UN force would mean a war with Hezbollah (and with Syria and Iran in the background) -- a task the UN force cannot accomplish.
从传统来看，在Bengali Sufi神秘的宗义教导下，大部分穆斯林人与其他宗教信仰者和平相处，并且孟加拉国在妇女教育和妇女人权方面拥有良好纪录。	Traditionally, under Bengali Sufi mystical teachings, the majority Muslim population lived peacefully with other religions, and Bangladesh had a good record on education and civil rights for women.
虽然已经实施了一些旨在减少青年人失业的相关计划，但不了解哪些岗位已经存在而哪些依然短缺却严重制约着计划的效果。	Initiatives aimed at reducing youth unemployment, while numerous, can only be so effective if we don’t know which types of jobs already exist and which are needed.
但依赖于一种无视这些因素的手段无异于把消防局撤销，寄望于这能令人们更加小心防火，以为这就不会再有火灾了。	But adhering to an approach that overlooks these factors is akin to doing away with fire departments, on the grounds that without them people would be more careful – and so there would then be no fires.
埃尔文属于基督教民主党（Christian Democratic Party ） ， 在智利，该党从旧保守党的废墟的基础上建立。	Aylwin belonged to the Christian Democratic Party, which in Chile emerged from the ashes of the old Conservative Party.
当然，这个策略的其中一部分将是为低排放技术引入市场激励体制，以便让那些私人研究者在有利可图的情况下发展自己的新技术。	Of course, part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low-emission technologies, so that inventors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large profits if those ideas are right.
此外，奥巴马在去年春天因为美国国会政治僵局及其导致的政府关门而取消了亚洲之行，这给地区领导人造成了不良的印象。	And President Barack Obama’s cancellation of his trip to Asia last autumn, owing to domestic political gridlock in the US Congress and the resulting government shutdown, made a poor impression on the region’s leaders.
此外，发达国家和国际金融机构应效仿二战结束后的马歇尔计划，在尚处于转型阶段的阿拉伯国家实施全面的经济复苏计划。	Beyond this, advanced countries and international financial institutions should implement a comprehensive economic recovery program for the Arab countries in transition, similar to the Marshall Plan implemented after World War II.
换句话说，如果没有预算削减，英国大概已经和西班牙成为难兄难弟了 — — 甚至可能成为另一个葡萄牙或希腊。	Put differently: without the budget cuts, Britain would have been Spain – or perhaps even Portugal or Greece.
波兰斯基和卡恩的性侵行为对象都是与他们大不平等的女性（波兰斯基案中是年龄，而卡恩案中则是社会地位 ） 。	Both Polanski and DSK were engaged in sexual activities with women who were far from being their equals, in age and social status, respectively.

避免这一后果的唯一方式就是寻求一个高回报投资，高价值政府服务和高水平家庭消费三者结合的均衡发展计划。	The only way to avoid this outcome is by pursuing a balanced program comprising high-return investment, high-value government services, and a higher level of household consumption.
民粹主义者尼格尔·法拉奇（Nigel Farage）领导的联合王国独立党（United Kingdom Independence Party，UKIP）要求伦敦保护英国独立于欧盟官僚体制。	The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), led by populist Nigel Farage, looks to London to protect British independence against the EU bureaucracy.
如果疫情无法迅速得到扭转，利比里亚和塞拉利昂恢复和平和几内亚民主转型开始后所取得的多数经济和社会成果均有可能毁于一旦。	If the outbreak is not contained soon, most of the economic and social gains achieved since peace was restored in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and since Guinea’s democratic transition began, could be reversed.

目前煤炭占韩国全国能源消耗的1/4左右，而在过渡到更环保电力的过程中的“桥接燃料”将由天然气来承担。	Currently, coal accounts for about a quarter of the country’s energy consumption. Natural gas would be used as a “bridging fuel” during the transition to greener power.
但准确地对比巴西与其他新兴市场经济体（它们的腐败不逊于巴西）的经验应该会导致巴西在投资者心目中的地位提升。	But an accurate comparison of Brazil’s experience with that of other emerging-market economies, where corruption is no less a problem, would, if anything, lead to an upgrade of Brazil’s standing among investors.
通过这些转述，她的自焚（jauhar）成为抵抗贪财好色的穆斯林的英雄之举，她也成为清白无暇的印度教女德的榜样。	Through those retellings, her self-immolation (jauhar) became a noble act of resistance against the lustful Muslim, making her an exemplar of unsullied Hindu womanhood.
同时，因为他们明白保护和推进全球化是反对贫穷和不安全感的最好的方法，他们把自己看作是真正的进步人士。	Meanwhile, they regarded themselves as the true progressives, because they understood that safeguarding and advancing globalization was the best remedy against poverty and insecurity.
爱尔兰和希腊，这两个曾经欧洲最为贫穷的国家，现在经济却已经急速增长。 希腊已经接近于欧洲的平均水平，并且爱尔兰也已经在最富有国家中占有一席之地。	Ireland and Greece, once the two poorest countries of Europe have surged economically, with Greece coming close to the European average and Ireland having already taken its place among the richest.
既不愿扩大外国工人数量，也羞于改变工作习惯来鼓励更多已婚妇女加入劳动大军的状况可能源自于了日本目前享有相对富裕。	Reluctance to expand the number of foreign workers and to change work customs to encourage more married women to join the labor force may reflect the relative affluence that Japan currently enjoys.
以色列领导人知道哈马斯有中程导弹（主要通过西奈地下渠道走私进入 ） ， 但他们仍然指出，不对加沙进行包围，伊朗和其他国家就会提供更多更先进的武器。	Israeli leaders were aware of Hamas’s buildup of medium-range missiles, mostly smuggled through Sinai in underground tunnels, but continue to argue that, absent the siege, Iran and others would supply more (and more sophisticated) weapons.
美国总统奥巴马政府试图劝说所有美国盟友不要加入亚投行，但西欧国家在英国的领导下集体倒戈，澳大利亚和韩国随后也加入了亚投行。	After discouraging all US allies from joining the AIIB, President Barack Obama’s administration watched as Great Britain led a raft of Western European countries, followed by Australia and South Korea, into doing just that.
虽然它也会带动其他需求 — — 房地产热使上年纪的管道工业务增加，让他可以花更多的钱去集邮 — — 但说大部分举债维持的需求是较为集中的并无不妥。	While it catalyzes a more generalized demand – the elderly plumber who works longer hours in the boom spends more on his stamp collection – it is not unreasonable to believe that much of debt-fueled demand is more focused.
在威斯敏斯特大教堂，每一位新议会成员都要进行基督教的祈祷仪式，作为主持的议长可能是基督教徒、犹太教徒甚至是无神论者。	In Westminster, every parliamentary sitting begins with Christian prayers presided over by Speakers who could be Christians or Jews or non-believers.
如果没有核聚变，子孙后代的能源选择将会受限严重 — — 由此为发达及发展中国家带来的问题都非常严重。	Without nuclear fusion, future generations’ energy options will be severely limited – creating a serious problem for developed and developing countries alike.
在除此之外再无证据的情况下，结构主义模型应预测通胀率已经上升并呈现上扬趋势 — — 而通胀率并没有上升，即使美联储用流动性“漫灌”经济。	With no more evidence than that, a structuralist model would predict an inflation rate that is already elevated and rising – and the inflation rate is not running high, even though the US Federal Reserve has flooded the economy with liquidity.
巴黎协议承认，很多科学家认为变暖超过1.5摄氏度就有危险，尤其对发展中国家和岛屿国家而言，适应过程将付出巨大的代价。	As the Paris agreement recognizes, many scientists believe that warming above 1.5ºC is risky and that adaptation to it will be extremely expensive, particularly for developing countries and island states.

当一国走在内战边缘时（比如1980年土耳其战争，7月份的埃及也大有这一势头 ） ， 军事干预有理可据；但你不能把重建秩序和重建民主混淆起来。	A case can be made for military intervention when a country finds itself on the edge of civil war, as Turkey was in 1980 (and as Egypt arguably was in July); but one should not confuse restoring order with restoring democracy.
《哥伦比亚新闻评论 》 （ Columbia Journalism）称这是一篇“石破天惊”的报道，但最近与CNN的“嘴仗”表明人们还不太情愿接受BuzzFeed为正统的新闻组织 — — 或许也不愿接受新媒体战争的出现。	The Columbia Journalism Review called the article “groundbreaking,” though recent squabbles with CNN indicate a certain reluctance to accept BuzzFeed as a legitimate news organization – and, potentially, even the emergence of a new media war.
如果我们对上述可能性善加利用，公共及私营部门合作可以让数百万人摆脱贫困，并协助建设一个更加和平、繁荣和安全的世界。	If we take advantage of these possibilities, public-private cooperation can enable millions of people to lift themselves out of poverty and help to build a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure world.

公众也很愿意采用心理—社会疗法，比如与人交谈和寻求建议，或结交朋友乃至找一份工作，而不是通过药物、电击或进入精神病院治疗的方式。	The public also favors psycho-social approaches, such as talking to someone and getting advice, or help finding friends or a job, rather than drugs, electro-shocks, or admission to psychiatric hospital.

问题是上述呼吁更有可能吸引高学历、已经掌握优势的群体，而不是那些在今天全球经济中感觉权利被剥夺的失意者。	The problem is that this call is more likely to appeal to the highly educated, already privileged classes than to those who feel disenfranchised in today’s global economy.
否决权克制的关键点是至少要提高阻挠为了确保柬埔寨、卢旺达、斯雷布雷尼察和叙利亚悲剧不再发生而采取的行动的政治成本。	The point of the veto restraint is, at minimum, to raise the political cost for those who would block action designed to ensure that there are no more Cambodias, Rwandas, Srebrenicas, or Syrias.
比如，特朗普正试图复兴煤炭等肮脏能源 — — 它们为第一次工业革命提供了动力 — — 而不是去投资太阳能、风能和其他为“第四次工业革命”提供动力的可再生能源。	For example, Trump is trying to revive dirty fuels like coal, which powered the first Industrial Revolution, rather than investing in solar, wind, and other renewables that will power the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.”
以消费者和服务主导的经济结构修正方案最早在十二五规划中提出，又得到最近闭幕的三中全会支持，这意味着GDP增长速度将比1980-2010年间平均达10%年增长率有所放缓。	The consumer- and services-led rebalancing initially proposed in the 12th Five-Year Plan and endorsed by the recently concluded Third Plenum implies slower GDP growth than the 10% average annual rate recorded from 1980 to 2010.
布什说中东人民希望像韩国一样繁荣和自由是正确的，但他认为伊拉克战争不过是美国在亚洲政策延续的观点却再错误不过。	Bush is right to claim that people in the Middle East would like to be as prosperous and free as the South Koreans, but his notion that the war in Iraq is simply a continuation of US policies in Asia could not be more mistaken.
理论上负利率迫使商业银行实际上需要付钱给中央银行才能把钱存在那里，因此理应刺激面向公司的贷款，公司得到贷款就会增加支出，包括雇用更多员工。	In theory, negative rates, by forcing commercial banks essentially to pay the central bank to be able to park their money, should spur increased lending to companies, which would then spend more, including on hiring more employees.

没有科学公式可以描述如何在各个国家之间公平分担全球遏制气候变化的负担，每个国家的政府都可以自信地宣布它的政策符合任何给定的气温目标。	No scientific formula can describe how to share the burden of global mitigation equitably among countries, leaving every government able to declare confidently that its policies are in line with any given temperature target.
2000年选战期间，小布什承诺放弃海外建国行动，保持财政纪律，并将温室气体作为污染物写入清洁空气法。	During his presidential campaign in 2000, George W. Bush promised to renounce nation-building adventures abroad, to maintain fiscal discipline, and to treat greenhouses gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
所谓的政策措施的“成本计算 ” （ 确定某项改革所带来的节约的精确数字）需要专业技能和活的大量数据。	The so-called “costing” of policy measures (determining the exact amount of savings brought about by a reform) requires technical skills and access to extensive data.
这意味着一旦负面情绪由于某种原因再度出现，就可能引发其它的所有症状¾这个过程被称为“认知反应 ” ） 。	This means that when the negative mood returns, for any reason, it will tend to trigger all the other symptoms – a process called “cognitive reactivity”).
在这方面美国的原则是坚持国际法 — — 包括自卫权 — — 也适用于网络冲突，并可以依照相应导致的物理破坏使用任何武器来回应网络攻击。	US doctrine is to respond to a cyber attack with any weapon, in proportion to the physical damage caused, based on the insistence that international law – including the right to self-defense – applies to cyber conflicts.
它还为议会铺平了道路，超过四分之一的议员是妇女。 仅仅在五年前，该国的妇女还不准在没有男性亲属陪同的情况下离开家门。	It also paved the way for a parliament in which over a quarter of the members are women – this in a country where, just five years ago, women were not even allowed to leave the house without a male relative.
如今，美国的中产阶级规模很小，他们只持有22%的总净金融财富，是其他工业化国家平均水平的一半，而其财富集中度比任何其他国家都要高。	Today, the US has the smallest middle class, holding just 22% of total net financial assets, half the average of other industrialized countries, and the highest concentration of wealth than in any other country.
2012年行动援助（Action Aid）调查发现，针对妇女的暴力变得更加普遍了，87%的妇女遭受着家庭暴力。	A 2012 Action Aid survey found that violence against women has never been more prevalent, with 87% of women suffering domestic abuse.

而意大利球员却恰恰相反，所有人都大声唱出Il Canto degli Italiani（意大利之歌）的歌词。	Contrast that with the Italian players, all of whom belted out the words of Il Canto degli Italiani (The Song of the Italians).
到了2008年，日本盈余的GDP占比为3.2 % ， 德国为6.7 % ， 而中国则为9.8 % 。	In 2008, the Japanese surplus was 3.2% of GDP, Germany’s was 6.7%, and China’s was 9.8%.
事实上，穆巴拉克已经呼吁巴勒斯坦内部重开对话，这样的努力可能会带来再次成立民族联合政府，也就是以色列和美国拒绝与之打交道的同样类型的政府。	Indeed, Mubarak has already called for a resumption of inter-Palestinian dialogue, which might lead to yet another attempt at a national unity government, the same kind of government with which both Israel and the US refused to do business.
而克罗地亚的加入（继黑山和其他一些巴尔干国家之后）可以弥补希腊退出的缺憾（如果希腊真的退出的话 ） 。	And the entrance of Croatia, followed by Montenegro and a few other Balkan countries, could compensate for the departure of Greece (should it come to that for the Greeks).
这一转型把世界交给了年青一代，他们比老一辈更精于技术，通过打破领土、语言和政府界限的社交网络彼此相连。	This transformation has placed the world in the hands of a younger generation, more technologically savvy than their parents and connected to one another through social networks that are not confined by territory, language, or government.
拜一系列针对世俗论官员的虚伪神牌所赐，土耳其总统埃尔多安成功地重塑了军队层级，将自己人安插在最高层。	Thanks to a series of sham trials targeting secularist officers, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had managed to reconfigure the military hierarchy and place his own people at the top.
两家公司的创新成功推翻了制造、分销、媒体和金融之间的壁垒，帮助中国经济在规模、范围、与速度维度同步提升。	Both broke down barriers among manufacturing, distribution, media, and finance, thereby achieving scale, expanding scope, and increasing speed.
简而言之，在欧洲境内外的众多国家之中有如此多人渴望实现意义深远的革新，那么性别政治也会在其中大显身手。	The point, simply, is that with so many people in so many countries demanding far-reaching change, the politics of gender is very much in play – in Europe and beyond.
据说塞浦路斯总统阿纳斯塔夏季斯（Nicos Anastasiades）及其在欧洲机构的支持者渴望避免这一结果 — — 以金融稳定的名义。	Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, reportedly with some support from European institutions, desperately tried to avoid this fate – in the name of financial stability.
今天, 全世界约有1/5 女孩在18岁前结婚或处于某种非正式关系之中，而这些女孩中的大多数会在成年前成为母亲。	Today, roughly one in five girls worldwide is married or in an informal union before they turn 18, and most of these girls will become mothers before they reach adulthood.

这些选民形成了特朗普基本盘的核心，而他在吸引这些蓝领工人方面的成功 — — 以及希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）在这方面的惨败 — — 可以有力地解释为什么是他而不是她成为了美国总统。	These voters came to form the core of Trump’s base, and his success in wooing them, combined with Hillary Clinton’s stunning failure to do so, goes a long way toward explaining why he is president and she is not.
里夫林认为政策制定界普遍认同一系列基本的经济原则，而公共政策辩论中所使用的评估，预测和模型都将构建于这些原则之上。	Rivlin believes that there is a general consensus within policymaking circles about basic economic principles, and that those principles will underpin the assessments, estimates, and models used in public-policy debates.
然而鉴于各方缺乏在这一方面向前推进的政治意愿，从国家层面的解决方案开始着手可能是明智的做法，一旦成功，就可以为欧元区一级的政策安排铺平道路。	Given the lack of political will to make progress on this front, however, it may be sensible to begin by focusing on national-level solutions that, if successful, could pave the way for eurozone-level arrangements.
目前，中国正时刻关注着香港即将在9月12日进行的立法会选举。 该选举会向香港和中国的政府反映民众对改革步伐和方向的态度。	Currently, all eyes in China are on Hong Kong's upcoming legislative election on September 12, which will indicate to Hong Kong's government and to China's leaders what people think about the pace and direction of reform.
另一个成功的季节性实验是2005年由现任东京都知事小池百合子（时任环境大臣）所推出的“酷商务”政策。	Another successful seasonal experiment was the “Cool Biz” policy introduced by Governor of Tokyo Yuriko Koike in 2005, when she was serving as minister of the environment.

正如我们的政策选择导致了我们今天所面对的SS1的形成，不能实施旨在解决SS2的政策可能造成未来更加难以应付的潜在不稳定状况。	Just as our past policy choices helped to generate the SS1 we face today, failure to implement policies aimed at tackling SS2 could create a much more intractable and potentially unstable situation tomorrow.
沿用欧洲最糟糕的政治传统对欧盟来讲无异于自杀，这些传统都有着安抚罪恶和认为对他人的自由不闻不问是维护和平最佳方式的共同特点。	It is suicidal for the EU to draw on Europe’s worst political traditions, the common denominator of which is the idea that evil must be appeased and that the best way to achieve peace is through indifference to the freedom of others.
只要碰到困难就退而幻想纯国家主权能解决欧盟各国所有问题其实不过是一种认识谬误和政治幻想，因此会在社会上带来相当大的负面影响。	The idea that, when the going gets tough, an EU country can solve all of its problems by reverting to pure national sovereignty is an intellectual fallacy, a political chimera, and thus a source of considerable social frustration.
这意味着那些专门用于杀灭潜在微转移病症的癌症辅助疗法可能会忽略了一部分重要的弥散性癌症细胞，而这些细胞最终会醒来做恶。	This means that adjuvant cancer therapy, designed to kill presumed micrometastatic disease, may be missing an important fraction of disseminated cancer cells, some of which may eventually wake up.
讽刺的是，这一下滑伴随着与朝鲜关系的改善，而去年强劲的表现则是在朝鲜半岛游走在核边缘的情况下取得的。	Ironically, this slump coincides with improved relations with North Korea, while the strong performance last year occurred in spite of nuclear brinkmanship on the Korean Peninsula.
而且，因为其工作基本以项目为基础并由成员国为具体活动提供资金，其在减轻难民危机方面的表现在很大程度上取决于各成员国的目标和偏好。	And, because its work is largely project-based, with member states funding specific activities, its role in mitigating refugee crises is largely reliant on individual members’ preferences and priorities.
许多银行家都在银行倒闭后受到了直接经济损失，或者相关调查使他们在公众面前蒙羞，甚至有些人被投进了监狱。	Many bankers also suffered direct losses as their banks collapsed, or as investigations exposed them to public ridicule, and even jail.
这场战争已经变得如此生硬 — — 如此暴力 — — 以致于拉美很多人现在感到惊讶，弄不清病理性成瘾更为严重的究竟是哪一方。	So rote – and so violent – has that war become that many people in Latin America now wonder which side is suffering the more pathological addiction.
如果这些攻击包括迫使帕特尔出局，那么对印度储备银行 — — 也是印度普遍失能的官僚体系中唯一备受尊重的技术官僚机构 — — 的打击将会极为严重。	And if those attacks include forcing Patel out, the blow to the RBI – the only well-respected technocratic institution in India’s mostly dysfunctional bureaucracy – would be severe.
即使不存在直接的政治化，美联储也总是面临着华尔街的“认知俘获（cognitive capture ） ” 问题，在格林斯潘和伯南克主政时就是如此。	Even in the absence of direct politicization, the Fed always faces a problem of “cognitive capture” by Wall Street. That’s what happened when Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke were in charge.
这门入门课程通常会教授一个在很大程度上令人放心的信息：如果允许市场发挥作用，就必然会获得良好的结果 — — 如生产力增长、工资增长以及大众普遍共享的繁荣。	This introductory course is typically taught with a broadly reassuring message: if markets are allowed to work, good outcomes – such as productivity growth, increasing wages, and generally shared prosperity – will surely follow.
与此同时，危机爆发前所存在的金融不平衡和扭曲让应对实体经济中的技术和全球市场推动力的必要措施推迟了。	At the same time, the financial imbalances and distortions that precede a crisis delay appropriate and necessary responses to technological and global market forces in the real economy as well.
作为哈佛商学院美国竞争力项目的一部分，迈克尔·波特和詹·利夫金（Jan Rivkin）最近发表了一项可在未来两到三年内实施的八点计划。	As part of the Harvard Business School’s US Competiveness Project, Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin recently published an eight-point plan, which could be implemented within the next two to three years.
中欧和东欧国家的人均收入虽低，却蕴藏着丰富的高素质人力资源，而富裕程度远高于此地的奥地利则并非如此。	Central and Eastern European countries had low per capita income, but were rich in skills. Austria, far wealthier, was not.
其次，我们必须说服FARC领导人严肃对待谈判符合他们的自身利益，而通过暴力和游击战争是无法达到他们的目的的。	Second, we had to convince the FARC’s leaders that it was in their own personal interest to enter serious negotiations and that they would never achieve their objectives through violence and guerrilla warfare.
危机是在所有领域 — — 包括便利在发展中国家逃税的富裕国家的银行业务 — — 取得更大透明度的机会。	The crisis is an opportunity to achieve greater transparency on all fronts, including banking practices in rich countries that facilitate tax evasion in developing nations.
其中一种提法是由欧洲议会来决定欧洲央行的目标，理由是欧洲议会由民主选举¾就像签订《马斯特里赫特条约》不是一项民主进程。	One idea making the rounds is for the European Parliament to define the ECB’s objectives, on the basis that it is democratically elected – as if the Maastricht Treaty did not result from a democratic process.
但是，对英国人来说，存在互相竞争的索偿主张令它大舒一口气，这有助于英国抵挡蜂拥而至的对两个或更多世纪的对遥远殖民地的掠夺所带来的各种不公平拨乱反正的要求。	For the British, however, the existence of contending claims is a major relief, as it helps the country to fend off a blizzard of demands to undo the manifold injustices of two or more centuries of colonial exploitation of far-flung lands.
俄罗斯总统站在维克多·亚努克维奇这一边，因为他得到了俄国驻基辅大使、前总理维克多·谢赫诺密丁的公开支持。	Indeed, Russia's president is rallying behind Yanukovych, who has open backing from Russia's ambassador in Kiev, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
柏林—长期以来，工业农业（industrial-agriculture sector）一直被人诟病加剧了气候变化、环境破坏和农村贫困。	BERLIN – The industrial-agriculture sector has long faced criticism for practices that contribute to climate change, environmental destruction, and rural poverty.
互联网创业家提尔（Peter Thiel）和国际象棋传奇卡斯帕罗夫认为经济萎靡更加严重，经济学家戈登（Robert Gordon）亦作如是观。	The Internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and the legendary chess champion Garry Kasparov have suggested that the malaise runs even deeper, as has the economist Robert Gordon.
德国人通过把蛋糕做大来调解国家间利益冲突，在德国的帮助下，欧洲一体化在马斯特里赫特条约的签署和欧元的诞生中达到了高峰。	With the Germans helping to reconcile conflicting national interests by putting a little extra on the table, the process of European integration reached its apogee with the Maastricht Treaty and the introduction of the euro.
但是在撒哈拉以南非洲、中东和南亚很多低收入国家，女性的教育机会仍远远逊于男性，特别是在中学和大学教育阶段。	But, in many low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, girls still have far less access to education, especially at the secondary and tertiary levels, than boys do.
由于城市化进程的步伐迅猛，打造一个资源城市就需要技术来支撑，因此“同步失败”的风险就会持续增加。 东日本大地震就是一个例子。	Given the rapid pace of urbanization, and the technology base that a well-resourced city requires, the risk of “synchronous failure” is growing constantly, as the Great East Japan Earthquake demonstrated.
自从健康问题迫使菲德尔·卡斯特罗退出古巴领导班子以来，劳尔彻底向军队敞开了大门并开始排挤那些备受其兄器重的文官。	Since ill health forced Fidel Castro to retire from Cuba’s leadership, Raúl has opened the doors to the military and pushed out even those civilians who had been his brother’s trusted associates.
当然，在面临中国经济挑战的环境下，美国乐于与欧洲大陆构筑统一战线 — — 特别是在贸易问题上，而欧洲仍是世界领先的商业势力。	Of course, faced with the Chinese economic challenge, America would be happy to forge a united front – especially in matters of trade – with the continent that is still the world’s leading commercial power.
但是，如果没有广泛的一致方法，可能会出现各国监管各自为政的局面，跨国银行业务将因此变得效率更低、价格更高、也更难以驾驭。	But, without a broadly consistent approach, the authorities risk creating a legal patchwork that would make cross-border banking less efficient, more expensive, and more difficult to conduct.
参与该项目的五个欧洲公司（各占10%的股份）声称它们与俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司（拥有余下50％股份）的合作伙伴关系就是个单纯的商业计划。	According to the five European companies involved in the project (each with a 10% stake), their partnership with Russia’s Gazprom (which owns the remaining 50%) is simply a commercial business initiative.
此外私人银行也可以增加对这一货币单位的使用，就像当年一些欧洲银行使用所谓欧洲货币单位来为欧元铺平道路那样。	Moreover, private banks could increase their use of this monetary unit, just as some European banks used the so-called European Currency Unit, helping to pave the way for the euro.
通过Cataphora开发出来的名为“Digital Mirror（数码魔镜 ） ” 的新软件，你可以了解到自身关系网中的高度不对称性：你会首先对谁作出回应，又会对谁的邀约进行推辞，改期或者延后 — — 而谁又会对你做出同样的行为。	With Cataphora’s new software tool called Digital Mirror, you can see the top asymmetries in your own relationships: whom you respond to before others versus whom you postpone, reschedule, or otherwise delay – and who does the same to you.
但一些关于国际协作的呼声并不那么有用，特别是当它们的目标是指责外国人、从而转移对国内约束条件和分歧的关注时。	But some calls for international coordination are less useful, particularly when the aim is to blame foreigners in order to distract attention from domestic constraints and disagreements.
在一些情形中，领导人发现不可能及时充分地引导追随者，或者追随者分歧太大，无法形成可以保持集体行动的共识。	In some instances, leaders find it impossible to educate their followers adequately in time, or their followers are too deeply divided to reach a consensus that will sustain collective action.
纽约—前伦敦市长、左派工党政客肯·利文斯通（Ken Livingstone）因为宣称希特勒在20世纪30年代初是犹太复国主义者而被工党暂停党员资格。	NEW YORK – The former London mayor and left-wing Labour politician Ken Livingstone has been suspended from his party for claiming that Hitler was a Zionist in the early 1930s.
这么说可能有挖苦意味，但在历史上就是这样，面对无法解决的国内中产阶级的深层次忧虑，政府也是一直利用宽松的信贷政策作为权宜之计。	Cynical as it might seem, easy credit has been used throughout history as a palliative by governments that are unable to address the deeper anxieties of the middle class directly.
欧洲人几乎不可能走上街头去谴责美国的“本质 ” （ 即美国是什么和美国在干什么 ） ， 而在布什时代甚至克林顿时代他们就这样做了。	It is very unlikely that Europeans will take to the streets to denounce the “essence” of the United States – what America is as much as what America does – as they did during the Bush era and even during the Clinton years.
事实上，人类已知最致命的疾病是天花；直到1796年爱德华·詹纳（Edward Jenner）发明了天花疫苗前，它一直是欧洲的第一死亡原因。	In fact, smallpox is the deadliest disease known to humanity; until Edward Jenner developed the vaccine in 1796, it was the leading cause of death in Europe.
更广义而言，什叶派穆斯林可以利用这一规定，像伊朗那样，将他们的宗教领袖，阿亚图拉们置于民选的议会之上。 因为他们被授权可以独立决定伊斯兰的“法规 ” 。	More broadly, the Shias can use this provision to place their ayatollahs over the elected parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are authorized to determine the “rules” of Islam.
但是今天我们面临的任务是把这些科技的进展应用到给全世界，尤其是那些身处资源贫乏的国家的人民提供治疗和预防措施上去。	But nowadays our task is to apply these scientific and technological advances to delivering treatment and prevention strategies to people throughout the world, particularly those in resource-poor nations.
全民基本收入也是完全“随身 ” （ portable）的，从而能够帮助频繁跳槽的人士、无法长期依靠一个雇主获得社会保险的人士以及自由职业人士。	A UBI would also be totally “portable,” thereby helping citizens who change jobs frequently, cannot depend on a long-term employer for social insurance, or are self-employed.
如果你不是“标题党 ” ， 就会发现鼓吹将食肉客赶出餐厅、要求人人改变食谱的人，常常是断章取义而无视基本事实的人。	When you look beyond the headlines, those arguing for banishing meat-eaters from restaurants and calling on everyone to change their diets are often cherry-picking the data while ignoring basic facts.
纽约 — — 对美国（以及其他许多发达国家）经济来说，一个显而易见的事实是，过去5年来，银行家得到了巨量资金。	NEW YORK – For the American economy – and for many other developed economies – the elephant in the room is the amount of money paid to bankers over the last five years.
ISIS有一支小规模战斗力量，美国预测其在伊拉克和叙利亚有20,000到25,000人，在利比亚还有5,000人左右。	ISIS has a small fighting force, which the US puts at 20,000 to 25,000 in Iraq and Syria, and another 5,000 or so in Libya.
联邦众议院对德国的欧盟政策有着至关重要的影响，因此，目前的局面可能削弱默克尔政府提供欧洲目前所需要的领导力的能力。	Given the Bundestag’s central role in shaping Germany’s EU policy, this could weaken the capacity of Merkel’s government to provide the kind of leadership Europe now needs.
"中国的流行音乐爱好者们能够听任何想听的音乐，包括麦当娜所唱的""我会动摇整个体制 "" 。 普通的中国人也需要勇气呐喊这样的讯息。"	"While pop music fans in China can listen to whatever they like, including Madonna singing ""I'm gonna shake up the system,"" ordinary Chinese need courage to speak such messages aloud."
当总理埃尔多安的正义与发展党（AKP）于2002年上台时，它不但缺少民主文化，还颇可担心世俗-军队保守派如何反应。	When Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002, it not only lacked a democratic culture, but also had much to fear about how the secularist-military old guard might react.
对来自新兴国家的竞争的恐惧也是2000年资产投机泡沫破裂的自然结果；一些国家的股市市值跌倒不及顶峰时期的一半。	Increased fear of competition from emerging countries is also a natural consequence of the collapse of the speculative bubble in equities in 2000; stock markets in some countries fell to less than half their peak value.
委内瑞拉总统查韦斯已经公开提议废除央行的独立地位。 他呈交了一份允许他自由支配该国外汇储备的宪法改革方案。	Venezuelan Preseident Hugo Chávez has openly proposed abolishing the central bank’s independence, submitting a constitutional reform that would allow him to use the country’s international reserves as he sees fit.
在国家情报委员会看来，美国实力的多面性表明即使中国最早于2020年代在经济上超过美国，也很可能无法撼动2030年美国和其他大国同处全球领导地位。	In the NIC’s view, the multi-faceted nature of US power suggests that even as China overtakes America economically – perhaps as early as the 2020’s – the US will most likely maintain global leadership alongside other great powers in 2030.
奥巴马应该采取主动，使明年哥本哈根会议不再是讨论为低效的技术提供越来越高的补贴，而是把投资向未来的技术突破倾斜。	Obama should seize the initiative and make the meeting in Copenhagen next year not about bloated subsidies for inefficient technologies, but about lean investments in future breakthroughs.
与此同时，工资中位数却几乎没有增加 — — 这跟与第二次世界大战后那段时期大相径庭，那时生产率不断提高，令工资得以稳步增长。	At the same time, median wages have barely increased – a dramatic change from the immediate post-World War II period, when productivity increases led to steady wage gains.
欧洲就像一块吸引着数亿潜在经济移民的磁石，它能够、应该，并且我相信也必将重新控制自己的边境，让它变得更强，并对移民进行必要的限制。	Europe, a magnet for hundreds of millions of would-be economic migrants, could, should, and I believe would regain control of its borders, allowing it to strengthen and enforce necessary limits on migration.
就朝鲜问题而言，美国在这方面最精干的谈判者克里斯托弗·希尔（Christopher Hill）指出，美国应该澄清一点：解决朝鲜半岛分裂状态的任何方案都不会给中国造成战略损失。	In the case of Korea – as Christopher Hill, one of the most effective US negotiators on these matters, remembers – the US should make it clear that no possible solution for the divided peninsula would mean a strategic loss for China.
凯丽安妮·康维（Kellyanne Conway）是特朗普竞选经理，后转任白宫法律主管，关于她的一篇新特写指出，她没有“忘记，当人们认为她是板上钉钉的输家时，是怎么对待她的。	A new profile of Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager turned White House counselor, notes that she has not “forgotten how people treated her back when they thought she was a sure loser.
据巴勒斯坦发展和重建经济理事会（PECDAR）统计，加沙地带的年人均收入继续维持在大约700美元，而以色列的人均收入却达到了16，000美元。	According to the Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development (PECDAR), annual per capita income in Gaza continues to average roughly $700, while Israelis enjoy incomes averaging a $16,000 per capita.
他们倾听的目的可以是多种多样的 — — 从识别该提供什么产品或服务，了解何种客户需要什么东西，到弥补一些错误所导致的损失都可以。	They can listen for many purposes – from figuring out what products or services to offer and understanding which customer wants what, to repairing the damage done when something goes wrong.
去年一场资本海啸又激起一轮高潮，股权投资和固定收益投资资金争先恐后涌入新兴市场，因为觉得那里的宏观经济、政策与金融基本面依然强劲。	In the past year, the world has seen another boom, with a tsunami of capital, portfolio equity, and fixed-income investments surging into emerging-market countries perceived as having strong macroeconomic, policy, and financial fundamentals.
事实上，德国的贸易盈余与欧元没有什么关系；而欧元早已成为理所当然的替罪羊 — — 随时拿来替其他政策错误顶罪。	In fact, Germany’s trade surplus has little to do with the euro; which has become a convenient scapegoat – a stand-in for other policy mistakes.
使用“工作证明”技术的区块链 — — 许多流行的加密货币采取这种方式 — — 则会产生另外一个问题：它们需要巨量能源来保证。	Blockchains that use “proof-of-work,” as many popular cryptocurrencies do, raise yet another problem: they require a huge amount of raw energy to secure them.
中国最好的可再生能源供应（尤其是风能和太阳能）均位于国家西部，而大部分人口和能源需求均集中在东部的太平洋沿岸。	China’s best supplies of renewable energy (especially wind and solar power) are in Western China, while most of China’s population and energy demand are concentrated on the Pacific (eastern) seaboard.
俄罗斯巨大的天然气财富也吸引着中国，最近两国完成了一项为期30年、价值4,000亿美元的天然气供给协议，中国获得了极为优惠的价格。	Russia’s vast natural-gas wealth also appeals to China, which drove a hard bargain in the two countries’ recently concluded 30-year, $400 billion gas-supply deal.
持有黄金对像中国和印度这些国家的中产阶级和贫困家庭来说也有意义，因为这些国家大大限制国内人民的其它金融投资渠道。	Holding gold can also make sense for middle-class and poor households in countries – for example, China and India – that significantly limit access to other financial investments.
但它们近乎垄断的分销地位这使其成为公共事业企业，因此也应受到更严格的监管，以维护竞争，创新以及公平公开的准入机制。	But the fact that they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulation, aimed at preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open access.
主要是由于沙特和其他阿拉伯联盟国家的斡旋而建立了法塔赫和哈马斯民族团结政府。 美国和欧洲联合摧毁这一政府从而犯下了一个重大错误。	The Americans and Europeans committed a major error in conspiring to destroy the Fatah-Hamas national unity government, which was created largely thanks to the diplomacy of Saudi Arabia and other Arab League countries.
他们但愿社会和政治生活的全部最终都落在应该是“无许可 ” （ 向所有人开放）和“无信任 ” （ 不依赖银行等可信中介）的公共账簿上。	They would like the entirety of social and political life to end up on public ledgers that are supposedly “permissionless” (accessible to everyone) and “trustless” (not reliant on a credible intermediary such as a bank).
罗斯福说，布莱恩“就像是制陶家手上的粘土，被野心勃勃、肆无忌惮的伊利诺伊州共产主义者玩弄在股掌之间 。 ”	Bryan, Roosevelt said, “would be as clay in the hands of the potter under the astute control of the ambitious and unscrupulous Illinois communist.”
但是，与斯大林一样，他营造了一种恐惧和无法的气候，让克里姆林宫背后的团体觉得有责任竭尽全力揣摩领袖的意愿除掉他的反对者。	But, like Stalin, he has nurtured a climate of fear and lawlessness, in which those who rally behind the Kremlin feel a duty to eliminate the leader's opponents however they can, and in anticipation of his will.
这样看来，金正日想要避免伊拉克的萨达姆和利比亚的卡扎菲的覆辙相当合理，萨达姆和卡扎菲当初要是已经获得了可发射的核武器的话，现在肯定还活着掌权。	It is only logical, on this view, that Kim Jong-un wants to avoid the mistake made by Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi, both of whom would still be alive and in power had they acquired deliverable nuclear weapons.
上面所描述的就是所谓“错误配置”的结构性失业 — — 但这并不是我们当前面对的问题，至少在欧美地区来说。	That is what “mismatch” structural unemployment looks like – and it is not what we have today, at least not in Europe and North America.
但任命莫格里尼至少有一点令人振奋，尽管这个振奋点不太明显：欧洲央行行长马里奥·德拉吉（Mario Draghi）也是意大利人，这是一个有利因素。	But there is at least one encouraging, if hidden, signal from Mogherini’s appointment: The fact that the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is also an Italian was not an impediment.
事实上，国际原子能机构（IAEA）记录表明，每年都有大量与核材料和放射性材料有关的盗窃和其他非法行为。	Indeed, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) records numerous cases of theft and other unauthorized activities involving nuclear and radioactive material every year.
欧洲帝国主义列强用炮舰外交打开新市场和殖民前哨站，中国则用主权债务令其他国家屈服而不必耗费一枪一弹。	Just as European imperial powers employed gunboat diplomacy to open new markets and colonial outposts, China uses sovereign debt to bend other states to its will, without having to fire a single shot.
但是，几乎从一开始 — — 特别是在1971年《时代》杂志发表名为《新遗传学：从人变成超人》的特写文章以来 — — 科学和社会就高估了遗传学的影响。	But, almost from the beginning – and most intensely since 1971, when Time magazine published a special section entitled “The New Genetics: Man into Superman” – science and society alike have tended to overestimate the impact of genetics.
而那些虽然难以描述，但可以体现可信度并维护市场信心的一整套政策也可以召唤出保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）口中的“信心仙女 ” 。	So can the elusive set of policies that are supposed to show credibility and keep markets confident, summoning the “confidence fairy,” as Paul Krugman would say.
当中国的贸易顺差规模已经大幅缩小，经济增长对出口的依赖也进一步减轻之时，人民币的升值本应更早更快的启动，但这一进程的延迟令通过人民币升值来重新平衡经常账户所付出的代价更大。	RMB appreciation should have started earlier and at a faster pace, when China’s trade surplus was much smaller and its growth was much less dependent on exports. Delay has made current-account rebalancing via RMB appreciation costly.
只要银行 — — 政府亦然，它们的债务都被银行买去了 — — 可以从欧洲央行体系中获得任意数量的低成本信贷，欧洲就将维持高波动性的状态。	As long as banks – and thus governments, which sell their debt to the banks – can draw cheap credit up to any amount from the European System of Central Banks, Europe will remain volatile.
在美国，1980年的格拉姆-罗德曼-霍林斯（Gramn-Rudman-Hollings）法所规定的赤字上限从未被执行过，与GSP一样，该上限也被修订和扩大了。	In the US, the 1980’s deficit limits set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law were not met, and, like the SGP, were revised and extended.
但当2013年民主党参议员戴安妮·费恩斯坦（Diane Feinstein）提出类似的禁令时，共和党却一致反对她。	But when Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein proposed a similar ban in 2013, Republicans overwhelmingly opposed her.
工作、学习、休闲、保持健康和“生产性”应该成为我们生活的连续统的一部分，政策目标应该明确指向促进这一连续统、增加可测福祉。	Working, learning, enjoying leisure, and being healthy and “productive” should be part of a continuum in our lives, and policies should be explicitly aimed at what facilitates this continuum and increases measured wellbeing.
合格专业医护人员如此至少，这意味着修补医疗系统所需要的远不止于在利比里亚热带雨林深处的农村地区建设新医院和诊所。	With very few qualified health-care professionals, repairing the health-care system demands more than building new hospitals and clinics across Liberia’s densely rain-forested countryside.
它是否能有助于我们体会到，对我们的幸福感来说，很多事情比我们把钱花在时装、昂贵的手表和美食上的能力更重要？	Could it help us to appreciate that many things are more central to our happiness than our ability to spend money on fashion, expensive watches, and fine dining?
尽管公海水产养殖所需化石燃料比商业捕捞更少 — — 并且可以利用太阳能、风能和潮汐能等可再生能量源 — — 但和传统渔场相比仍属于能源密集。	Although open-ocean aquaculture should still require less diesel fuel than commercial fishing – and could run on renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or waves – offshore aquaculture is more energy-intensive than conventional fish farms.
媒体尽可以吹毛求疵、企业也不妨满腹牢骚，但解决全球问题需要加强 — — 至少也是改善、而不是削弱政府领导。	Business can moan and the media can carp, but the answer to many of the world’s great problems is more – or at least better – government, not less.
因此，在2004年4月26日，中国宣布了香港不会在2007年实现民主的单方面决定，并且没有说明香港何时实现民主。	Thus, on April 26, 2004, China announced its unilateral decision that Hong Kong is not to have democracy in 2007 without saying when Hong Kong will have it.
特朗普禁止七个主要穆斯林国家民众赴美的行政命令已经在法院三次被否决，而白宫现在表示它将不会上诉至最高法院。	Trump’s executive order to ban people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US has been rejected three times in court, and the White House now says that it will not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.
这些国家总体失业率极高（青年人失业率更是高到了足以拉响警报的程度 ） ， 而且无法自力更生实现增长。	They have high overall unemployment (and alarmingly high youth joblessness), and are unable to grow on their own power.
在这样的背景下，巴西20世纪70年代开始的推动可再生燃料发展的经验直接关系到今天对行业政策截然相反的观点。	In this vein, Brazil’s experience at promoting renewable fuels, beginning in the 1970’s, is directly relevant to today’s polarized views of industrial policy.
随着英国-欧盟谈判的启动，对企业来说至关重要的是要时刻牢记这一点，紧紧关注脱欧工作组，而企业的其他管理层要专注于商业大战略。	As the UK-EU negotiations get underway, it is critical that companies bear this in mind, by ring-fencing Brexit working groups and keeping the rest of the firm’s management focused on broader business strategy.
毫不奇怪，至少一部分美国证券和交易委员会（SEC）官员对此持消极态度 — — 毕竟这是在砸他们的场子。	Not surprisingly, at least some people at the US Securities and Exchange Commission have reacted negatively – this is stepping onto their turf, after all.
方济各通谕的标题参考了圣方济各歌颂创建一切的上帝的《太阳颂 》 （ Canticle of the Sun ） — —这也是罗马天主教传统中最重要的环境整体论表述。	The encyclical’s title refers to the Canticle of the Sun, St. Francis’s song of praise to God for all creation – the foremost expression of environmental holism within the Roman Catholic tradition.
这意味着科学家可以运用CRISPR-Cas机制来纠正基因组中的问题 — — 相当于文本中的拼写错误。	This means that scientists can apply the CRISPR-Cas mechanism to correct problems in the genome – the equivalent of typos in a written text.
这部分是因为中国担心朝鲜一旦崩溃将导致大量难民涌入并形成一个投靠美国的统一的韩国，因此它将继续保证朝鲜获得其所需要的燃料和粮食。	This is partly because China, fearing large refugee inflows and a unified Korea in America’s strategic orbit should North Korea collapse, will most likely continue to ensure that it gets the fuel and food it needs.
圣战组织救国阵线（Jabhat al-Nusra）已更名为胜利阵线（Jabhat Fatah al-Sham ） ， 并且据说已与基地组织脱离，这也使它能够更好地与其他同样拒绝了基地组织的叛军派系结盟。	Now that the jihadist group Jabhat al-Nusra has changed its name to Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and reportedly dissociated itself from al-Qaeda, it is better positioned to ally with other rebel factions that have also rejected al-Qaeda.
如果任由目前的趋势继续下去，世界多数现存的生物物种将在本世纪末灭绝，而造成这种局面的虽然也有其他因素，但最主要的还是粮食产量。	If current trends continue, the majority of the world’s remaining species will be extinct by the end of the century, and it is food production, above all other factors, that has driven the decline.
此外，烟民和PNV使用者一口一口地吞云吐雾，可以非常精确地控制他们所消费的尼古丁剂量，几乎完全杜绝了过量吸入风险。	Moreover, smokers and PNV users control very precisely, on a puff-by-puff basis, the dose of nicotine they consume, virtually eliminating the risk of overdose.
真正的问题是，土耳其既非在经济上准备就绪，而且最为重要的是，并不是一个符合欧盟成员资格的完全民主国家。 这一问题连大多数土耳其人都不质疑。	The real issue – not disputed even by most Turks – is that Turkey is neither economically ready nor, above all, a mature enough democracy for full EU membership.
布什政府把直接赠款作为起对外援助政策的核心，这种原则在新的援助机构“千年挑战帐户”中得到了充分的体现。	The Bush administration has put outright grants at the center of its foreign-assistance policy, a commitment that is embodied in its new aid agency, the “Millennium Challenge Account.”
但中国经济陷入了动荡，重要的东亚“小龙”经济体（如马来西亚和泰国等）颓势尽显，甚至新加坡也面临着经济模式是否可行的问题，难道这个“亚洲世纪”即将夭折？	But with China’s economy in turmoil, key East Asian “tiger” economies like Malaysia and Thailand floundering, and even Singapore facing questions about the vitality of its economic model, is this “Asian century” coming to a premature end?
除了一小撮顽固的马克思主义分子¾他们目前还把持着10%左右的选票¾人们都清醒地意识到要改变过去10年高失业和低增长的状况，必须要实行较为深入的改革。	Except for a fringe of die-hard Marxists – which can still collect up to 10% of the votes – there is a keen sense that deep reforms are needed to come to grip with the high unemployment and poor growth of the last decade.
具有讽刺意味的是，尽管法塔赫在议会选举中败北，冻结了巴勒斯坦资金的以色列人和国际社会还是想让阿巴斯继续控制安全部队。	Ironically, the Israelis and the world community, which had basically frozen Palestinian finances, wanted Abbas to continue to control the security forces, despite Fatah’s loss in the parliamentary elections.
但即使希腊债务完全得到豁免，从相当于10%的GDP的初级赤字转变为预算平衡仍要求大大地勒紧裤腰带 — — 以及不可避免的衰退。	But even if Greece’s debt had been completely wiped out, going from a primary deficit of 10% of GDP to a balanced budget requires massive belt tightening – and, inevitably, recession.
政府当时确实成功稳住了股价，但却是通过为经纪商创造额外激励机制，同时禁止卖空并对卖出股票设置一定的门槛来实现的。	The government did manage to stabilize prices, but it did so by creating added incentives for brokers and banning short-sells and the sale of stocks above a certain threshold.
虽然桑德斯的提案尤其在年轻人中颇受欢迎，但他的很多议程 — — 如将奥巴马医改转化为某种单一付款人的健康体制 — — 在政治领域的可行度不高。	While Sanders’s proposals are popular, particularly among young people, much of his agenda – such as transforming Obamacare into a single-payer health system – isn’t politically feasible.
直升机撒钱的概念由诺贝尔经济学奖获得者米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）在1969年提出，意指直接向公众分派新印钞票，并且央行承诺永不收回。	The idea, introduced by the Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman in 1969, entails the distribution of freshly printed money directly to the public, with a commitment from the central bank never to withdraw it.
联合国安理会通过了2254号决议，支持让叙利亚实现结束冲突的过渡，而国际叙利亚支持组织（International Syria Support Group，ISSG）已经定下了将在下个月进行的下一次会议的日期。	The United Nations Security Council has adopted Resolution 2254, expressing its backing for a transition out of the conflict, and the International Syria Support Group has set a date for its next meeting, to be held next month.
而最近一条则来自波士顿大学财富与慈善事业研究中心，中心预计美国人将在2010年拿出约2500亿美元的个人慈善捐助，比去年又增长了数十亿美元。	The newest bit of good news comes from The Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College, which estimates that Americans will give about $250 billion in individual charitable contributions in 2010, up several billion from last year.
稍稍更进一步，就可以用这些观点看待G20的基本经济问题 — — 金融稳定、宏观经济管理、贸易政策、结构性改革。	It is a small step from such arguments to consider the G20’s bread-and-butter economic issues – financial stability, macroeconomic management, trade policies, structural reform – in the same vein.
因此，德国联邦银行和荷兰央行不但要为来自西班牙的直接支付指令授信，还必须给因西班牙银行在第三国的回购所产生的间接指令授信。	Thus, the German Bundesbank and the Dutch central bank must credit not only the direct payment orders from Spain, but also the indirect orders resulting from the Banca de España’s repurchases in third countries.
结论是，德国陆军参谋长赫尔穆特·冯·毛奇（Helmuth von Moltke） 在1914年的夏天热切地渴望一场战争。	It turns out that the German Army Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke was eager for war in the summer of 1914.
巴勒斯坦民族权力机构(PA）没有这么极端，但是它的领导力量薄弱，没有控制加沙，而且仍然充斥着了强硬原素。	The Palestinian Authority (PA) is less extreme, but its leadership is weak, doesn’t control Gaza, and is still full of hard-line elements.
这些战略基金由从私营部门招募的财务专业人员进行管理，主要投资于股权，并在构建和安排新交易方面发挥积极作用。	Managed by finance professionals recruited from the private sector, these strategic funds invest primarily in equity, and take an active role in structuring and arranging new deals.
海空战让人想起北约在20世纪70年代末、80年代初所采取的空陆战（AirLand Battle）方针。 空陆战是为了抵抗日益增加的苏联对欧威胁。	Air-Sea Battle recalls the AirLand Battle idea that NATO adopted in the late 1970s and early 1980s to counter the growing Soviet threat to Europe.
欧盟放宽对塞尔维亚，黑山共和国和马其顿的签证限制的决定 — — 以及欧盟巴尔干整合战略的主要构建者乔治·帕潘德里奥在希腊重新掌权的事实 — — 都是令人感到乐观的理由。	The EU’s decision to liberalize its visa regime for Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia – and the fact that George Papandreou, the major architect of the EU’s Balkan integration strategy, is back in power in Greece – is another source of optimism.
与此同时，随着工作岗位的流失，税收收入也将流失，从AI中获利的公司亦不可能甘愿为它们的前雇员们提供充分的社会福利。	Meanwhile, as jobs go, so will tax revenues; and it is unlikely that the companies profiting from AI will willingly step in to support adequate social-welfare programs for their former employees.
而该国的后发地位正好解释了其33年的快速经济增长，所以要了解未来进一步快速增长潜力的关键就在于估算今后还能存在多大的后发优势。	Because the country’s latecomer status explains its 33 years of rapid economic growth, the key to understanding its potential for further rapid growth in the future lies in estimating how large those advantages still are.
三分之二人口的每日生活费用仍不足1.25美元，但贫困和儿童死亡率有所下降，免疫接种率和入学率有所上升。	While two-thirds of its people still survive on less than $1.25 per day, poverty and child mortality have fallen, while rates of immunization and school enrollment are rising.
成员国之间的合作以及如何处理和平与正义之间的关系都是需要代表们在会议期间以及未来持续关注的现实问题。	Cooperation from member states and the relationship between peace and justice are just two vital issues that require sustained attention at Kampala and beyond.
就连并不属于美国亲密盟友的国家 — — 比如判处两名路透社记者七年监禁的缅甸 — — 也不会面临美国的报复。	Even countries that are not particularly close US allies – such as Myanmar, where two Reuters journalists have been sentenced to seven years imprisonment – do not face pushback from the US.
尽管如此，虽然“一带一路”倡议显然是部分是由战略目标所驱动的，但成本效益分析表明其经济意义也极大 — — 大到有人或许会质疑为什么中国不早点执行。	Nonetheless, while the Belt and Road initiative is clearly driven partly by strategic objectives, a cost-benefit analysis shows that the economic case is also very strong – so strong, in fact, that one might ask why China didn’t undertake it sooner.
生产率增长萎靡部分是因为贸易开放度不足，这制约了巴西企业获得国外投入品和技术，也阻碍了有效的国内竞争。	Weak productivity growth partly reflects a lack of trade openness, which limits Brazilian firms’ access to foreign inputs and technologies, as well as barriers to effective domestic competition.
霍尼格和达拉斯联储银行主席理查德·费希尔（Richard Fisher）是美联储内部该问题的主管者。	Hoenig and Richard Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, have been leading the charge on this issue within the Federal Reserve System.
乐观的看法是只要那些兜售专长的人为赢得有识之士（即大众传媒）的注意而拼命竞争，那么市场机制就一定能够控制质量。	The sanguine view is that as long as those selling expertise compete vigorously for the attention of discriminating buyers (the mass media), market mechanisms will assure quality control.
毕竟，经济学家道格拉斯·斯泰格（Douglas Staiger ） 、 詹姆斯·斯托克（James H. Stock）和马克·沃森（Mark W. Watson）证明自然失业率并非可以准确测算的稳定参数已经过去了20多年。	After all, it has been more than 20 years since economists Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson showed that the natural rate of unemployment is not a stable parameter that can be estimated precisely.
当年林登·约翰逊（Lyndon Johnson）总统决定升级美国对越南的干预时，就引用了慕尼黑的例子 — — 后者因坐视希特勒的恶行而导致了灾难性的后果。	President Lyndon Johnson, when deciding to escalate US intervention in Vietnam, drew an analogy with Munich, when the failure to respond to Hitler’s aggression had catastrophic consequences.
事实上，因为在移民和融合方面做得太少，有些政府已经把控制权让给了人贩子和一心盘剥移民血汗的雇主，并因此助长了社会分裂和阻碍了发展经济。	Indeed, by doing too little to manage migration and integration, some governments have ceded control to smugglers, traffickers, and exploitative employers, thereby contributing to social division and hampering economic growth.
在几乎所有的发达经济体中，高度的不平等、中产阶段的压力和人口老龄化等问题，再加上失业和财政资源短缺，将激化政治冲突。	Indeed, in virtually all advanced economies, high levels of inequality, strains on the middle class, and aging populations will fuel political strife in a context of unemployment and scarce fiscal resources.
经合组织要求采取大杂烩式的改革，这将影响到公司治理、私人保险市场、薪酬政策、统计数据、医疗、技术、农业和其他许多监管领域。	The OECD demands a smorgasbord of reforms affecting corporate governance, private insurance markets, competition policy, statistics, health, technology, agriculture, and many other regulatory areas.
国际奥林匹克委员会是一家不受监管的全球垄断机构，它组织双年拍卖会，让全世界城市彼此竞争，证明自己才是合适的主办者。	The International Olympic Committee (IOC), an unregulated global monopoly, conducts a biannual auction whereby the world’s cities compete against one another to prove their suitability.
光是在2月，就有尼日利亚 (1,000百万瓦 ) 、 澳大利亚(2,000百万瓦)和印度(10,000百万瓦)等新项目公布。	In February alone, there were announcements of new solar power projects in Nigeria (1,000 megawatts), Australia (2,000 MW), and India (10,000 MW).
今天眼看着美国就要掉下二次探底的悬崖了；过了一晚，受消费回弹刺激和美国跨国公司终于开始着手使用手里的大把现金储备，看上去高速复苏又近在眼前了。	One day, the country is on the brink of a double-dip recession; the next, it is on the verge of a turbo-charged recovery, powered by resilient consumers and US multinationals starting to deploy, at long last, their massive cash reserves.
此外“独立”还将剥夺英国对未来欧盟改革 — — 包括单一服务业市场的最终构建 — — 的影响力，这些都是英国本该从中受益的改革。	And “independence” would deprive Britain of influence over future EU reforms – notably, the completion of the single market in services – from which it would benefit.
事实上，在一个对新兴经济体前景日渐担忧的世界里，由于财政状况稳定，加上美国经济复苏势头增强带来的商品需求增加预期，墨西哥正面临着一次机遇。	Indeed, in a world that has grown nervous about emerging economies, Mexico stands out as an island of opportunity, with a stable fiscal position and the prospect of rising demand for its goods as the US recovery gathers momentum.
欧元区最发达的国家德国经历了戏剧性的转折，2006年的国内生产总值增长了2.7 % ， 为2000年以后增长率之冠。	Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, had a particularly dramatic turnaround, with annual GDP up by 2.7% in 2006, the highest rate since 2000.
第二次失败发生在1936-1939年阿拉伯人为抗议英国人在巴勒斯坦的统治而发动的起义期间，这次起义伴随了对犹太公民大规模的恐怖袭击。	The second failure occurred during the Arab Revolt against British rule in Palestine in 1936-1939, which was accompanied by massive terror attacks against Jewish civilians.
而世界最富裕的六个国家 — — 美国、中国、日本、德国、法国和英国 — — 占了全球GDP的60 % ， 但去年只接受了不到9%的难民。	The world’s six wealthiest countries – the US, China, Japan, Germany, France, and the UK – account for 60% of global GDP, but they hosted fewer than 9% of all refugees last year.
用巴黎第十一大学医学伦理学教授伊曼纽尔·赫希的话说 ， “ 我们的生物伦理学标准究竟能在多长时间内抵御其他逻辑，特别是财务逻辑的崛起 ？ ”	In the words of Emmanuel Hirsch, professor of medical ethics at the University of Paris-XI, “How long can our bioethical standards continue to resist the rise of other logics – particularly financial ones?”
因为除了那些战乱地区之外，只有非洲有如此庞大的青年人群体 — — 占总人口的60 % — —随时准备冒一切危险逃离家园。	Apart from war-ravaged regions, only Africa has so many young people – some 60% of the population – who are prepared to brave any danger to flee their land.
到目前为止，联合国秘书长潘基文已经通过他的“调停”来关注危机，并任命易卜拉欣·甘巴里作为其对缅甸统治者的代表。	"To date, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has been addressing the crisis through the use of his ""good offices,"" with Ibrahim Gambari serving as his representative to Burma’s rulers."
乌克兰国家银行的领导层理解，该行必须采取行动来遏制通货膨胀，但是其坚持与美元挂钩限制了他们的行动，因为这不让他们有效地提高利率。	The NBU’s leadership understands that it must act to contain inflation, but its insistence on the dollar peg ties their hands, because it prevents them from raising interest rates sufficiently.
建言者没有具体说明美联储必须以同一价格向所有人提供黄金（如1933年以前那样）还只是向外国政府提供黄金（像1945—1971年那样 ） 。	The proponents do not specify whether the Fed would be obliged to provide gold at this price to all comers, as before 1933, or only to foreign governments, as between 1945 and 1971.
并且这对于俄罗斯本身来说也可能十分昂贵：莫斯科发生（类似于最近的安卡拉的）自杀式炸弹袭击只是时间问题。	And it could prove expensive to Russia itself: it is only a matter of time before suicide bombings (such as the recent attack in Ankara) occur in Moscow.
欧洲的历史将会如何发展也许现在还不明了，但欧洲黑暗历史的终点却近在眼前-只要欧洲人继续在一体化的道路上前行。	The end of history may not be at hand in Europe, but the end of Europe's dark history is clearly in sight - so long as Europeans continue on the path of integration.
我们想让所有新政府都把政治反对者抓起来 — — 如被推翻的乌克兰总统尤先科对前总理季莫申科所做的那样 — — 只因为政府拒绝他们所采取的政策，或不满于它所感到的政策结果吗？	Do we want every new government to jail its political opponents – as Ukraine’s deposed President Viktor Yanukovych did to former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko – because it rejects the policies they enacted or condemns the perceived outcomes?
欧盟15国的平均人口大约是2500万，比美国各州的平均人口600万要大得多，后者与欧盟地区，比如巴伐利亚、瓦隆区、法国和加纳利群岛的平均人口差不多。	The average population of the EU-15 is about 25 million, many more than the six million in the average US state, which more closely resembles the average population of EU regions, such as Bavaria, Wallonia, Île-de-France and the Canary Islands.
特朗普上台对美国经济和工人固然是个坏消息，其气候变化、人权、媒体和确保和平与稳定的政策对所有人的伤害也一样深远。	As bad as his administration will be for America’s economy and workers, its policies on climate change, human rights, the media, and ensuring peace and security are likely to be no less damaging for everyone else.
2017年，一项法国研究发现素食者往往比肉食者更加健康，因为他们所吃的食物更加丰富，同时减少了卡路里的摄取量。	A 2017 French study found that vegetarians are often healthier than meat eaters because they eat a more varied diet and consume fewer calories.
三年前，我认为智能机器所带来的好处能否被广泛分享并非取决于其自身功能设计，而是依赖于围绕它们的政策设计。	Three years ago, I argued that whether the benefits of smart machines are distributed broadly will depend not on their design, but on the design of the policies surrounding them.
自2012年上台以来，各种各样的人 — — 从香港小书商（包括一些非中国公民）到中国子夜领袖 — — 被秘密绑架并抓回中国。	Since he came to power in 2012, all sorts of people – from small-scale book publishers in Hong Kong (including some holders of non-Chinese citizenship) to Chinese business leaders – have been covertly kidnapped and returned to China.
因此，即便中国引入了更多的市场管制来取得一个积极的成效，它必须计划好用发达经济体在2008年危机前缺失的政策工具去限制信贷创造。	So, even as China introduces greater market discipline to a largely positive effect, it must plan to constrain credit creation with policy tools that were missing in the advanced economies before the 2008 crisis.
阿富汗是1947年巴基斯坦独立后加入联合国的唯一一个反对国，这导致两国近70年来双边关系一直很紧张。	Afghanistan was the only state that opposed Pakistan’s entry into the United Nations when it gained independence from British rule in 1947, contributing to nearly 70 years of bilateral tensions.
如果要在艰难境地下取得成功，政府意识到自身困境和弱点，能够清晰描绘和制定自身目标并不断寻求实现愿望的方法。	Success in the face of difficulties happens when governments are conscious of their predicament and their weaknesses, can articulate and own their goals, and search relentlessly for ways to achieve their aspirations.
美国西部电力协调委员会的研究已经发现寻找更好的方式来储存能量可以削减总浪费量的约18 % ， 并提高11%的电能使用效率。	Studies by the US Western Electricity Coordinating Council have found that finding better ways to store energy could cut total waste by about 18% and boost the efficiency of electricity use by up to 11%.
对印度来说，中国的入侵还威胁了它对达普桑以西的海拔6300米锡亚琴冰川（Siachen Glacier）的接近。	For India, the Chinese incursion also threatens its access to the 6,300-meter-high Siachen Glacier, to the west of Depsang.
据国际货币基金组织（IMF）的数据，2013年俄罗斯人均收入（以购买力平价衡量）大约为18,600美元，是中国人均收入10,000美元的近两倍。	Wrong. According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia’s per capita income in 2013, measured in terms of purchasing power parity, is roughly $18,600, nearly double China’s per capita income of around $10,000.
由国民阵线古老的法国极右翼势力和愤愤不平的工薪阶层选民组成的联盟像美英两国那样出人意料地不期而至将不太可能。	Its coalition of the old French far right and disaffected working-class voters will not arrive unannounced or defy expectations, as happened in the US and the UK.
在克里姆林宫的庇护下，这些地区已经沦为新闻和信息“黑洞 ” ， 在这些地方，政府可以自由行事，而不必害怕承担任何后果。	With the Kremlin’s blessing, these regions have been turned into news and information “black holes,” where the authorities are free to act without fear of consequences.
通过构建并制度化彼此之间的联系，美国的亚洲盟友能够改变以美国为中心的星系网络，形成更加类似于网格模式的地区安全网络，它们不但与美国相连，彼此之间也联系在一起。	By building and institutionalizing ties among themselves, US allies in Asia can reshape their regional security network from a US-centric star to a mesh-like pattern, in which they are as connected to one another as they are to the US.
这种愈演愈烈的疏离情绪在美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿对装备了核武器的巴基斯坦安全情况不断恶化且对美国“造成致命”威胁的指责中发挥了极大的作用。	This growing alienation probably played a considerable part in US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying that deteriorating security in nuclear-armed Pakistan “pose(d) a mortal” threat to the US.
中国对伊犁河水资源的截留也使哈萨克斯坦的巴尔喀什湖面临成为第二个咸海的危险，因为它的面积已经萎缩到不足原来的1/2了。	China’s water appropriations from the Illy River threaten to turn Kazakhstan’s Lake Balkhash into another Aral Sea, which has shrunk to less than half its original size.
事实上，在整个欧元区危机中，德国在援助欧盟伙伴国方面付出的是绝对最小值 — — 并且总是在最后关头才付出。	Indeed, throughout the eurozone crisis, Germany did the absolute minimum – and always at the last possible moment – to assist its EU partners.
布拉格 — — 欧洲政治结构的一个基本支柱就是对平等的、普遍的和不可剥夺的人权这个普世价值抱有强烈而坚定的信念。	PRAGUE – One of the fundamental pillars of Europe’s political architecture is a strong and enduring belief in the universal validity of equal, universal, and inalienable human rights.
不幸的是，对于某些国家来说，真正的弱点其实是在私人部门的资产负债表上，家庭和非金融企业都承担着极高的金融杠杆。	Unfortunately, the real vulnerability of some countries is rooted in private-sector balance sheets, with high leverage accumulating in both the household sector and among non-financial firms.
最后，最近人民币兑美元贬值幅度只有2.5 % ， 从6.2元兑1美元贬至6.35元兑1美元 — — 远远比不上日元、欧元和英镑两位数的贬值幅度。	Finally, the renminbi’s recent decline against the dollar was only 2.5%, from CN¥6.2 to CN¥6.35 – far below the double-digit declines of the Japanese yen, the euro, and the British pound.
我们应当做出政策和投资选择，缓解转型期所带来的痛苦，降低转型成本，并确保收入的增长部分在各团体间得到公平分配。	It is up to us to make the policy and investment choices that can ease the transition, reduce its costs, and ensure that the income gains are equitably shared.
此外，拙劣的物流基础设施、彼此不同的州税制，以及特殊企业的补贴让效率低下的公司能够存活下来并占据资源，拉低了平均生产率。	Moreover, weak logistics infrastructure, differentiated state tax regimes, and subsidies to specific firms enable less efficient companies to survive and retain resources, lowering average productivity.
叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德冷言支持政变表明有人希望将当今阿拉伯世界的斗争转变为穆斯林和世俗者的血腥冲突。	Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s cynical declaration of support for the coup is a sign that some want to turn today’s struggle in the Arab world into a bloody contest between Islamists and secularists.
普罗迪的左翼l’Union联盟是遍布所有政治领域的一个各党大杂烩，从坚定的共产主义者到以前的自由主义者（上次选举中共产主义者势力更强 ） 。	Prodi’s left-wing l’Unione coalition comprises a hodge-podge of parties spread all over the political spectrum, ranging from staunch communists to former liberals (with communists stronger than in the previous election).
美国直接动用联邦国防预算来做到这一点 — — 本年度该项支出已近7000亿美元，超过了中、俄、英，印、法、日，沙特和德国八国的国防预算总和。	The US simply does it though its federal defense budget – where outlays of close to $700 billion this year are more than the combined total earmarked for defense in China, Russia, the United Kingdom, India, France, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Germany.
根据新选举制度，所有这些政党相互竞争拉选票，并且每个政党将寻求保护其自身的选民或对已完成的事项邀功。	Under the new electoral system, all of these parties will be competing with each other for the same votes, and each one will seek to protect its own constituency or claim credit for whatever is accomplished.
就持久性和确定偏好（conviction of preferences）而言，大部分社会为寻求离婚的夫妻设置的障碍都要大于首相卡梅伦政府给脱离欧盟的决定所设置的障碍。	In terms of durability and conviction of preferences, most societies place greater hurdles in the way of a couple seeking a divorce than Prime Minister David Cameron’s government did on the decision to leave the EU.
生活在墨西哥的墨西哥人和美国的美籍墨西哥人普遍食用这种名叫Mayocoba、Canario或Peruano的黄豆。	The bean is consumed throughout Mexico and by Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the US who know it by the names Mayocoba, Canario, or Peruano.
立即行动可以想象成是购买金融家们所说的“长尾保险 ” — —以期获得针对所有可能结果中最坏结果的某种保护。	Acting now can be thought of as buying what financiers call “tail insurance” – some protection against the most adverse among all the possible outcomes.
在纽约州尼亚加拉福尔斯（Niagara Falls ） ， 我们和一个更大的团体见了面，其中包括去年主持了纽约州第一场同性恋婚礼的保罗·迪斯特（Paul Dyster）市长和一名带着抗议标语参加这场婚礼的牧师。	In Niagara Falls, New York, we met with a larger group, including Mayor Paul Dyster, who last year officiated at the state’s first gay wedding, and a pastor who had also attended that wedding, carrying a protest sign.
巴黎 — — 看看1950年5月9日通过欧洲煤钢共同体启动欧洲统一计划的《舒曼宣言 》 ， 再看看2010年5月9日在拯救希腊和欧元问题上战战兢兢的提案，两者间的对比真是判若云泥。	PARIS – The contrast between the Schuman Declaration of May 9, 1950, which launched the European unification project through the Coal and Steel Community, and the fearful bid to save Greece and rescue the euro of May 9, 2010, could not be more stark.
但是，在目前俄罗斯虎视眈眈以及拒绝从格鲁吉亚完全撤军的情况下，加速乌克兰加入北约的进程是不合时宜的。	But with Russia in a defiant mood and refusing to fully withdraw its troops from Georgia, now is not the time to accelerate efforts to bring Ukraine into the Alliance.
尽管零售消费增长率放缓至10.7 % ， 但《中国商业发展报告》仍然预测中国国内零售市场将在2020年达到50万亿元规模。	Though the consumption growth rate has slowed to 10.7%, the Blue Book projects that China’s domestic market may reach CN¥50 trillion by 2020.
这意味着今年印度对全球GDP增长的贡献可能只有0.6个百分点 — — 只有中国预计贡献幅度1.2个百分点的一半。	That means India’s contribution to global GDP growth is likely to be just 0.6 percentage points this year – only half the 1.2-percentage-point boost expected from China.
二月上旬，联合国环境规划署将在纽约联合国总部召集某些世界主要经济体国家开会。 会议上将会推出全球绿色新政计划。	In early February, the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world’s leading economists at the UN’s headquarters in New York.
但是，当朝鲜还是一个向中国进贡的臣属国时候，中国与日本有关朝鲜统治权之争是东亚之剧的焦点，作为清朝帝国的前哨地区的台湾仅仅只是一个小节目。	But, whereas the struggle between China and Japan for dominance over Korea was the focal point of the East Asian drama, Taiwan was but a side-show, a mere outpost to the Imperial Qing Dynasty, while Korea was a vassal paying tribute to China.
而且，信用评级机构穆迪指出中国选择参与其以基础设施为重点的一带一路倡议的都是那些全世界在财政上最不安全的国家。	And the credit-ratings agency Moody’s notes that many of the countries China has chosen to participate in its infrastructure-focused Belt and Road Initiative are among the world’s financially insecure.
法国维希政权信奉天主教社团主义，持同样观点的还有遍布比利时和捷克各地的德国保护国，以及约瑟夫·蒂索治下在名义上保持独立的斯洛伐克。	Vichy France embraced Catholic Corporatism, as did German protectorates over Belgium and the Czech lands, as well as nominally independent Slovakia under Monsignor Jozef Tiso.
例如2011年摩根大通就因违反美国对古巴，伊朗和苏丹的制裁而支付了88​​30万美元罚款，而其主席杰米·戴蒙可没被人从飞机上抓走羁押起来。	In 2011, for example, JP Morgan Chase paid $88.3 million in fines in 2011 for violating US sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. Yet Jamie Dimon wasn’t grabbed off a plane and whisked into custody.
放牧家畜让牧民得以在日益难以预测和具有挑战性的环境 — — 气候干旱、资源匮乏 — — 中创造生活。	Cattle herding allowed nomads to create livelihoods in an increasingly unpredictable and challenging environment, characterized by an arid climate and scarce resources.
类似地，印度学界或许也处于停滞不前的状态，但新Pratap Bhanu Mehta等公共知识分子正在崛起于主流之外。	Similarly, Indian academia may be moribund, but new public intellectuals like Pratap Bhanu Mehta have emerged from outside the mainstream.
联合国的衰落是实实在在的，但我们必须铭记联合国第二任秘书长哈马舍尔德的不朽名言 ： “ 联合国不是用来把我们带上天堂的，它是用来把我们带离地狱的 。 ”	The downsides are real, but we need to remember the immortal words of Dag Hammarskjold, the UN’s second secretary-general: “The UN was created not to bring us to heaven, but to save us from hell.”
贸易要想繁荣，必须有一个开放的环境，在这个环境中，自愿的参与者带着良好的意愿行动并受到明确的规则的管理。	Trade thrives in an open environment of willing participants acting in good faith and governed by clear rules.
2012年后，95%的小儿麻痹病例都出现在五个国家 — — 阿富汗、巴基斯坦、尼日利亚、索马里和叙利亚 — — 它们无一例外都是受伊斯兰叛乱影响的地区。	Since 2012, 95% of polio cases have occurred in five countries – Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia, and Syria – all of which are affected by Islamist insurgencies.
与阴谋论的内容相反，这个委员会没有什么权力；但和其他非正式的“蹊径”外交渠道一样，它使私人公民（private citizens）能够探索管理棘手问题的方法。	Contrary to conspiracy theories, the Commission has little power; but, like other informal channels of “track two” diplomacy, it allows private citizens to explore ways to manage thorny issues.
人们现在都想，当一个大到不允许崩坍的金融机构遇到问题的时候，政府便会介入疏通。 但是政府要帮到什么程度呢？	In the past, government bailouts have typically protected all contributors of capital of a rescued bank other than shareholders.
按照莱弗里特的说法，卡扎菲早在伊拉克战争开始前就已经做出了决定，而且他做出这样的决定显然是对结束对利比亚国际制裁的一种补偿。	According to Leverett, Khadafi’s decision predated the invasion and was a response to an explicit quid-pro-quo to end international sanctions against Libya.
类似地，比利双胞胎的例子表明，存在一种可替代基于症状的疗法的方案等着我们去实现：基因组技术的降临不但可以改变我们的知识，更重要的是，还可以我们对自己的看法。	Similarly, the example of the Beery twins shows us that an alternative to symptom-based medicine can be realized: the advent of genomics technology can change not just what is known, but, more importantly, how we think of ourselves.
朝鲜最新的洲际弹道导弹试射改变了亚洲乃至世界的外交和战争格局，因为这将核风险提升到了绝无仅有的程度，此前只在1962年的苏联身上发生过一次。	The North’s latest ICBM test has transformed the theater of diplomacy and war in Asia, and possibly the world, as it implies a level of nuclear risk witnessed only once before, with the Soviet Union in 1962.
这种倾向对商业社会和大学都非常不利，前者失去了高等教育所带来的文化财富，而后者也在这种潮流的冲击下，迷失了真实世界中本该属于自己的位置。	This tendency has been detrimental both for the business world, which is deprived of the cultural wealth provided by higher education, and for universities, because it removes them from their proper setting in the real world.
另一派系源于十九世纪“不可知论”的民粹主义，带有其高涨的民族主义的歇斯底里、为传统的偏见辩护以及憎恨知识分子和经济学精英。	The other faction was rooted in nineteenth-century “know nothing” populism, with its flights of nationalist hysteria, defense of traditional prejudices, and resentment of intellectual and economic elites.
中俄两国利用美国在从加沙到喀布尔的范围内不断日益增加的困境是一回事；但是，如果局势恶化到整个地区总体上失去稳定，那就是另外一回事了。	It is one thing for Russia and China to exploit America’s growing difficulties from Gaza to Kabul; but it is quite another if the situation deteriorates to the point of general destabilization in the region.
即使今天没有给予特朗普实际支持，但经常呼吁在全球动荡地区单方面使用武力的马克斯·布特等人为特朗普铺平了道路。	Those, like Max Boot, who have often called for the unilateral use of force in global trouble spots, paved the way for him, even if they do not today support him.
由我发起、前尼日利亚总统���巴桑约（Olusegun Obasanjo）担任主席的西非毒品委员会（West Africa Commission on Drugs）在新报告中指出，可卡因、海洛因以及本地生产的甲基苯丙胺在西非地区越来越容易获得。	The West Africa Commission on Drugs, which I convened and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo chairs, points out in a new report that cocaine, heroin, and locally produced methamphetamines have become increasingly available across the region.
因此中国的经常账户顺差从2007年占GDP超过10%的顶峰迅速下跌如今大概2%的情况也就不出所料了，	It is no surprise, then, that China’s current-account surplus has shrunk rapidly, from its 2007 peak of more than 10% of GDP to about 2% of GDP today.
事实上，人们认为当局对保证金借贷的严打 — — 以及全球市场下跌导致的信心损失 — — 才是引发市场崩溃的罪魁。	It was, in fact, the authorities’ clampdown on margin borrowing, together with a loss in confidence as global markets declined, that is thought to have triggered the market meltdown.
刺激计划的效果因为旨在减少日本巨额债务负担的增加消费税计划而被抵消不少。 增加消费税将令日本消费者减少消费支出。	The stimulus package is being offset by consumption-tax hikes aimed at reducing Japan’s massive debt burden – a process that will lead many Japanese consumers to adjust their spending downward.
伦敦 — — 在撒哈拉以南非洲，一个从来不乏发展挑战的地区，博茨瓦纳因其强劲的经济、稳定的民主和对法治的承诺脱颖而出。	LONDON – In Sub-Saharan Africa, a region with no shortage of development challenges, Botswana stands out for its strong economy, stable democracy, and commitment to the rule of law.
尽管20世纪80年代全球变暖的详细情况对多数人而言都还很陌生，但那些要为全球变暖承担大部分责任的企业却比绝大多数人都更了解后果。	Although the details of global warming were foreign to most people in the 1980s, among the few who had a better idea than most were the companies contributing the most to it.
目前流行的观点认为下行趋势在很大程度上反映了均衡或者“自然”利率的下跌，而这种下跌的原因来自储蓄和投资基本面的改变。	The prevailing view is that the downward trend largely reflects a fall in equilibrium or “natural” interest rates, driven by changes in saving and investment fundamentals.
虽然这早已不是​​第一次把这些主题提出来谈了 — — 比如2011年时法国就曾力推货币改革，无奈却被欧元区危机中途打断 — — 但这次时机已经成熟，是时候实现一些真正的进展了。	While this is far from the first time these topics have come up – in 2011, for example, France pushed for monetary reform, but was waylaid by the eurozone crisis – the time may be ripe for genuine progress.
在人民币升值的部分作用下，2017年中国经济总量达到12.7万亿美元，意味着仅用12个月就大幅增长了13 ％ （ 1.5万亿美元 ） 。	Owing partly to a strengthening renminbi, China’s total economic output grew to $12.7 trillion in 2017, representing a massive increase of 13% ($1.5 trillion) in just 12 months.
第三期IPCC报告显示强硬的气候政策也比之前所说的更加昂贵 — — 2030年将占GDP的4 % ， 2050年6 % ， 2100年11 % 。	The third installment of the IPCC report showed that strong climate policies would be more expensive than claimed as well – costing upwards of 4% of GDP in 2030, 6% in 2050, and 11% by 2100.
慕尼黑 — — 由于中国已经将其估值过低的货币人民币与美国挂钩，因此美国金融危机后美元每次贬值都意味着人民币对其他世界货币贬值。	MUNICH – Because China has pegged its undervalued currency, the renminbi, to the dollar, every weakening of the dollar in the wake of America’s financial crisis has also meant a weakening of the renminbi vis-à-vis other world currencies.
同样地，接受非暴力的伊斯兰主义者参与公共生活的权利并不意味着放弃挫败极端保守主义、以及在某些情况下的极权主义社会观念的政治和意识形态斗争。	Similarly, accepting the right of non-violent Islamists to participate in public life does not mean giving up on the political and ideological struggle to defeat ultra-conservative, and in some cases totalitarian, conceptions of society.
可以肯定的是，特朗普不太可能发起一场惊天动地的贸易战，因为美国施加的任何关税都会损害本国那些大型企业的利益 — — 它们在国外生产设施投资上可是花了大钱的。	To be sure, Trump is unlikely to start an outright trade war, because any US tariff would harm the interests of the country’s largest companies, which have invested huge sums in production facilities abroad.
英国和美国媒体将此与纳粹时代相提并论，有的甚至在法国犹太教堂遭袭后认为这是法国的“水晶破碎之夜 ” （ Kristallnacht ） 。	British and American media reports have made comparisons to the Nazi era, with some even referring, in the aftermath of attacks on French synagogues, to a French Kristallnacht.
行政当局认为TPP将创造一些好工作 — — 以此“补偿”那些失去工作的人，但这种补偿往往被证明收效甚微且被普遍认定是无意义的。	The administration argued that TPP would create some good jobs – and that people who lost jobs as a result could be “compensated.” But such compensation always proves to be minimal and is widely viewed as meaningless.
公司通过股票回购 — — 有时用债务融资进行 — — 最小化其全球税负、同时刺激每股收益的能力作为一个稳定的趋势，并不让我惊讶。	Companies’ ability to minimize their global tax burden, while boosting their earnings per share through buybacks – in some cases financed with debt – does not strike me as a stable trend.
毕竟，我们可以接受警察队伍和公共安全健康和的费用支出，这当然不仅仅是医院，而且包括干净的用水，安全食物等等。	After all, we accept the costs of police forces and health care, including not just hospitals, but also clean water, safe food, etc.
但我并没有让与会者们去推导紧缩政策将对这些过度负债的西方发达国家造成何种影响，而是询问他们在1990年代末经济危机期间和之后的经历。	Rather than ask the Asian panelists to theorize about the impact of austerity in the overly indebted developed West, I asked them to assess their own experiences during and after the crisis of the late 1990’s.
伊拉克战争将会激化该国逊尼少数派和什叶多数派之间的摩擦，而这种摩擦在其他什叶派和逊尼派共同生活的地方很有可能重演。	War in Iraq will only exacerbate frictions between the country’s Sunni minority and Shia majority, and such frictions could well be replicated elsewhere where Sunnis and Shia live side by side.
沙龙和贝京在1980年代早期为根除巴解组织—一个永远无法达成的目标—一路打到贝鲁特，并为此付出了血的代价。	Ariel Sharon and Menachem Begin went all the way to Beirut in the early 1980’s, paying a terrible and bloody price, to try to eliminate the PLO – a result that could never be obtained.
但摩洛哥现在面临着自己的“突尼斯时刻 ” — —类似于2010年街头小贩博阿齐齐（Mohamed Bouazizi）为反对国家对自己的骚扰而自焚。	But Morocco is now facing its own “Tunisia moment,” reminiscent of the street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi’s self-immolation in 2010, in protest against state harassment.
与其父不同，34岁的金正恩一直积极寻求以市场为导向的经济增长，他或许以模仿20世纪70年代后期中国改革开放的总设计师邓小平为目标。	Unlike his father, the 34-year-old Kim has been active in pursuing pro-market economic growth and may be aiming to emulate Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China’s reforms in the late 1970s.
土耳其政府的应对措施是将反对者列为敌人，试图通过颁布新法律破坏司法独立性，限制言论自由 — — 包括关闭Twitter和YouTube。	In response, the government has branded its opponents as enemies, and sought to promulgate new laws undermining the independence of the judiciary and restricting freedom of expression – including shutdowns of Twitter and YouTube.
另一方面，奥地利学派经济思想（特别是哈耶克的思想）的追随者认为有限政府和自由企业构成了唯一可行的自由和繁荣之路。	On the opposite side, followers of the Austrian School of economic thought, especially the ideas of Friedrich Hayek, assert that limited government and free enterprise form the only viable path to liberty and prosperity.
富有国家每1000名出生的婴儿中有7个在5岁以前死亡；而在最为贫穷的国家里，每1000名出生的婴儿有155个在5岁以前死亡。	For every 1,000 children born in rich countries, seven die before their fifth birthday; for every 1,000 births in the poorest countries, 155 children die before their fifth birthday.
这一阴谋是那些欧债危机国中不愿实施行动、不愿改革的人们所怂恿出的概念，他们的目的就是想要德国人买账。 目前为止，默克尔的联盟就像是违反交通规则开车的人一样，非常肯定地认为其他所有人的行动都错了。	So far, Merkel’s coalition is like someone driving against traffic, dead certain that everyone else is going the wrong way.
俄罗斯和中国不喜欢美国充当全球领袖，一有机会就从中作梗，希望为自己赢得更大的全球影响力，并且（和美国一样）定期回归合作多边主义。	Russia and China dislike the United States’ claim to global leadership, enjoy tweaking its tail whenever they can, want greater regional influence, and (like the US itself) periodically turn their back on cooperative multilateralism.
基利奇达罗格乌到达伊斯坦布尔时，游行者打出要求经济平等、教育机会、性别平等和保证没有种族、宗教和文化身份歧视。	By the time Kiliçdaroğlu arrived in Istanbul, marchers were calling for economic equity, educational opportunity, gender equality, and a guarantee of non-discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, religion, or cultural identity.
纽约 — — 2011年9月11日，基地组织对美国发动了恐怖袭击。 他们的意图是要给美国点颜色看看，但采用这样的方式恐怕连本·拉登自己都没有想到。	NEW YORK – The September 11, 2001, terror attacks by Al Qaeda were meant to harm the United States, and they did, but in ways that Osama bin Laden probably never imagined.
根据国际清算银行的数据，在2008至2017年间主要发达经济体（美国，欧元区和日本）央行的综合资产持有量合共增加了8.3万亿美元。	From 2008 to 2017, the combined asset holdings of central banks in the major advanced economies (the United States, the eurozone, and Japan) expanded by $8.3 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
从全球角度来看，现在有五个国家已经达到了占0.7%GNP的援助水平，它们分别是：丹麦、卢森堡、荷兰、挪威和瑞典。	From a global point of view, there are currently five countries that have reached 0.7% of GNP in aid: Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.
中国经历了加工贸易的飞速发展：组装从美日等国进口的中间零件，这里所说的中间零件本身具有较高的资金及技术含量。	China has witnessed rapid growth in the processing trade: assembling intermediate inputs – imported from countries like the US and Japan – that have high capital and skill content.
彼得•苏瑟兰，曾任关税及贸易总协定(GATT)总干事，世界贸易组织(WTO)总干事，现任高级别贸易专家小组联席主席，该团体由英国、德国，土耳其和印尼政府联合设立，专责研究世界贸易体系。	Most distressing of all, even now, with the consequences of failure staring our political leaders in the face, they do not get it.
由是，两个来自斯堪的纳维亚的富于创新性破坏思维的脑袋与爱沙尼亚的低成本、创业友好型环境结合在了一起。	Thus, the two Scandinavians’ creative-destructive thinking was combined with Estonia’s low-cost, enterprise-friendly environment.
有一种共识是鉴于许多风险资产的价格，包括股权价格，已经下降如此之多，市场现在已经处于底部并且将很快出现快速反弹。	An emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risky assets – including equities – have fallen so much that we are at the bottom and a rapid recovery will occur.
在2001年初，前联合国秘书长科菲·安南（Kofi Annan）启动了一场强大并极具说服力的呼吁行动来建立全球基金会。	In early 2001, former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan launched a powerful and persuasive appeal to establish the Global Fund.
而大多数预测者 — — 包括来自国际货币基金组织和世界银行的那批 — — 如今都预测全球增长会在2014年上扬，而且在全球主要经济区域中变得更加均衡。	And most forecasters – including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – are now predicting that global growth will pick up in 2014, and that it will be more balanced among the world’s major economic regions.
除要解决竞争不充分、监管不力、对联网设备和服务计划征收高额税费等各项问题外，还必须解决为偏远地区提供高性价比接入服务的根本性挑战。	Beyond the need to address insufficient competition, inadequate regulation, and high taxes on Internet-enabled devices and service plans, there is the fundamental challenge of supplying cost-effective access to the most remote regions.
1995年至2995年期间，斯堪的那维亚国家的年平均GDP增长达到2.2 % ， 低于非斯堪的那维亚的欧元区15国平均2.8%的水平。	With average yearly GDP growth of 2.2% from 1995 to 2005 it fell short of the non-Scandinavian countries of the EU-15, which grew by 2.8% on average.
但随后，诞生了 iTunes、 YouTube、 Facebook、 Twitter、 Skype和 Netflix。	But then along came iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, and Netflix.
美国的《宪法》统一了最早的 13 块殖民地，其《第十修正案》又将未明文规定赋予联邦政府的一切权利保留给了各州政府。	The US Constitution knitted together the thirteen original colonies, and its Tenth Amendment reserves to the states all powers not expressly delegated to the federal government.
如果这些成本无法得到控制，对资本主义的支持就可能消失 — — 同时消失的还有实现经济增长繁荣的人类最美好的希望。	If these costs cannot be controlled, support for capitalism may disappear – and with it, humanity’s best hope for economic growth and prosperity.
北约不再能够支持乌克兰，反而必须在自己的土壤上自卫，使欧盟和美国都暴露在你它们急切地想要避免的风险之下：与俄罗斯发生直接军事冲突。	Instead of supporting Ukraine, NATO would have to defend itself on its own soil, exposing both the EU and the US to the danger they have been so eager to avoid: direct military confrontation with Russia.
奥巴马政府的财政刺激措施也对经济大有助益。 虽然其中减税措施的效力还难以判断，但联邦政府对各州的资助却成功地保住了大量就业。	And the cost of carrying the extra debt incurred is extraordinarily low: $12 billion a year of extra taxes would be enough to finance the fiscal-stimulus program at current interest rates.
千年发展目标为可持续发展目标题铺平了道路，我本人也因为全球社会对实现后2015年发展议程所表现出来的坚定决心而感到鼓舞。	The MDGs paved the way for the SDGs, and I have been encouraged by the commitment the global community has shown to sustaining the post-2015 development agenda.
中国经常项目盈余已有所下降，但如今北欧国家盈余达到了5000亿美元，而南欧的需求在崩溃，美国也维持着近5000亿美元的赤字。	China’s current-account surplus has declined, but now northern Europe runs a $500 billion surplus, while demand in southern Europe is collapsing and the US is running a deficit that is close to $500 billion.
例如2017年10月印度国家投资和基础设施基金就宣布与全球最大的主权财富基金之一的阿布扎比​​投资局达成一项价值10亿美元的交易。	For example, in October 2017, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund announced a $1 billion deal with a unit of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds.
第三个因素是后福利国家。 这是法国公民资格模式的一部分，并且保证给所有全职雇员全世界最高的最低工资和很高的雇主支付的福利。	The third component is the post-welfare state, which is now part of the French model of citizenship and guarantees all full-time employees one of the highest minimum wages in the world and high employer-paid benefits.
而其他人则把责任推卸给发展中国家 — — 特指巴西，中国和印度 — — 因为这些国家不愿签署限制性碳减排条约。	Others blame developing countries – particularly Brazil, China and India – for a reluctance to sign up to binding carbon cuts.
从这个角度讲，卡塔尔方针在成员国坐拥世界石油储量近一半的海湾合作委员会（Gulf Cooperation Council）内部造成了罕见的分裂。	In this sense, Qatar’s tack has produced a rare schism within the Gulf Cooperation Council, whose members collectively possess nearly half of the world’s oil reserves.
为了落实其战略支点，美国几乎在每个转折点都受到其地位的困扰 — — 历史超级大国、军事霸权、亚洲盟友的安全守护者。	In attempting to execute its strategic pivot, the US is haunted at virtually every turn by its status as a historical hegemon, a military power, and the guarantor of its Asian allies’ security.
股票市场高歌猛进，频创新高，而美国经济在2017年上半年平均增长率只有2 % — —慢于奥巴马总统任职期间的增长率 — — 在今年余下的时间中也难有起色。	While stock markets continue to reach new highs, the US economy grew at an average rate of just 2% in the first half of 2017 – slower growth than under President Barack Obama – and is not expected to perform much better for the rest of the year.
富国将依然扮演全球的重要角色，但是随着全球化者相对经济实力的上升，它们将需要在国际事务中扮演更重要的角色。	The Affluents will continue to be major global players, but as the Globalizers’ relative economic power rises, they will demand a greater role in international affairs.
在此期间，据说副总统迪克·切尼（Dick Cheney）曾宣称前总统罗纳德·里根证明了“赤字不重要 ” 。	It was during this period that Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly declared that former President Ronald Reagan had proved that “deficits don’t matter.”
让我们回到倍受通胀困扰的20世纪70年代末，时任总统吉米·卡特任命保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker）担任美联储领导。	Let me explain by going back to the end of the inflationary 1970’s, when President Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker to lead the Fed.
如果其目的只在于追偿所欠税款，就没有必要进一步瓦解该公司¾这些巨额债务，尤科斯集团本可以通过分期偿还逐步解决的。	Had the goal been mere recovery of tax arrears, there would have been no need to break up the company: Yukos could have settled even these colossal liabilities on a civilized installment schedule.
阿拉伯之春暴乱导致了大部分受影响国家陷入暴力和动荡，其背后的主要推动力正是绝望的年轻人要求权利和机会。	The Arab Spring uprisings, which led to violence and instability in most affected countries, were fueled largely by desperate young people demanding rights and opportunities.
阿以冲突一个令人伤心的不断发生的状况就是受到羞辱的阿拉伯一方并没有因为任何一次战争的失败而达成和平协议，正如以色列所取得的任何压倒性胜利并没有使它的领导表现出胜利者的大度。	It has been a sadly recurrent condition of the Arab-Israeli conflict that no war lost by a humiliated Arab side has ever ushered in a peace settlement, just as no war overwhelmingly won by Israel has ever led its leaders to be magnanimous in victory.
所有这些都没有对埃尔多安的国内支持率造成影响，美国和欧盟虽然咬紧牙关，但仍然在最近爆发的政变企图中对埃尔多安表达了支持的态度。	None of this has eroded Erdoğan’s support at home, while the United States and the European Union found themselves supporting him, albeit through clenched teeth, against the latest coup attempt.
随着刚刚闭幕的法塔赫第六次代表大会首次在以色列占领区内召开，意味着那些来自黎巴嫩和约旦的游击队领导人都获得了以色列方面的入境许可。	Its just concluded sixth congress was held for the first time in the occupied territories, which meant that former guerrillas from Lebanon and Jordan were allowed entry by Israel.
哈斯南对《新科学家》杂志就喜马拉雅山冰川退化情况作出评论，是在 1999 年，当时是冰川后退速度见顶后的第五年，后退放缓迹象刚刚出现了两三年，因此，按当时的条件，远不足以判断冰川消退的趋势已有所改变。	Hasnain made his remark to the New Scientist in 1999, only five years after the retreat had reached its peak and only two to three years after the slowdown began – far too soon to say that the trend had changed.
这意味着，欧盟谈判者可以施加的障碍（这些障碍主要影响货物贸易）可能比英国施加的障碍（例如欧盟工人配额）产生的影响小得多。	This means that the barriers that EU negotiators are in a position to impose – which largely affect trade in goods – are likely to have a much smaller impact than the UK-imposed barriers, such as quotas on EU workers.
考虑以下事实：1955年的《财富》500强公司只有11%今天仍然存在，与此同时，保持前500强地位的平均持续时间从75年下降到15年。	Consider this: only 11% of the Fortune 500 companies from 1955 still exist today, while the average time that companies stay in the top 500 has fallen from 75 years to 15 years.
最后，也是最重要的是，让我们希望，各地的恐怖主义都能被挫败，冲突消退，民主与资本主义能恢复一些前进的势头，更大范围的文明与诚实的对话能回归公共领域。	Finally, and most important, let us hope that terrorism is thwarted everywhere, conflicts subside, democracy and capitalism regain some momentum, and greater civility and honest dialogue return to the public domain.
美联储理事丹·塔鲁罗(Dan Tarullo)明智地削弱了纽约联邦储备银行的管辖权，因为该行基本处于大银行的把持之下了。	Governor Dan Tarullo sensibly weakened the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which had become largely captured by big banks.
艾滋病毒疫苗临床试验在2017年年底启动，南非医生报告治愈了一位男幼童的艾滋病。 他从婴儿阶段接受治疗。	Clinical trials for an HIV vaccine started at the end of 2017, while doctors in South Africa reported curing a young boy of the disease after he received treatments as an infant.
诺贝尔物理学奖得主尼尔斯·玻尔（Niels Bohr）的一句名言很有道理 ： “ 预测是件极难的事情，特别是关于未来的话 。 ”	A quote often attributed to the Nobel laureate physicist Niels Bohr says it best: “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.”
布隆博格市场杂志最近发表了一篇文章，详尽报道最大的合同研究组织在佛罗里达州进行某些临床试验的不合乎伦理的做法。	Bloomberg Market magazine recently published an extensive article on the unethical practices of the largest contract research organization conducting some clinical trials in Florida.
如果全球经济环境不是如此严峻，就连曾经发誓再也不向国际货币基金组织借款的国家，都恭敬地来到它的门前，那么，这样的伪善就是非常可笑的。	Such hypocrisy would be laughable if global economic conditions weren’t so dire that even countries that once swore never again to deal with the IMF have returned to its door, cap in hand.
在这个永久性解决方案的基础上，他们可以找到巴勒斯坦难民问题的解决办法，为法塔赫和哈马斯之间的和解事业而奋斗。	On this new and permanent basis, they may find a solution for the Palestinian refugees and advance the cause of reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.
此外，BJP此前反对与巴基斯坦总理沙里夫互动，叫停了起诉和惩罚2008年孟买袭击实施者的程序。 孟买袭击案造成164人死亡，300多人受伤，其起诉该案实施者是一件深得人心的事。	Moreover, the BJP had opposed interaction with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, pending satisfactory progress on the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed 164 people and injured more than 300.
但教育-工作不匹配状况之所以困扰着全球经济，部分原因是正规教育的毕业生不具备与劳动力市场对接的技能和技术能力。	But education-job mismatches plague economies worldwide, partly because formal education fails to produce graduates with skills and technical competencies relevant to the labor market.
从这个角度讲，最近德克萨斯州联邦法官中止该命令实施的裁决 — — 奥巴马政府正在就此进行上诉 — — 无助于共和党，不管反移民力量多么欢欣鼓舞。	In this sense, the recent ruling by a federal judge in Texas halting the order's implementation – a decision that the Obama administration is appealing – does not help the Republicans, however joyous anti-immigration forces may be.
这些袭击行动中最恐怖的于2008年11月26日同时发生在孟买的多个地点，并导致166名无辜平民因此丧生。	The most horrific of these attacks, the assaults on multiple locations in Mumbai, starting on November 26, 2008, killed 166 innocent civilians.
有模型根据近年来风险在短暂时间段里的“正态分布”来进行预测，然而这些模型声名狼藉，因为它们不能捕捉政治体制里风险的真实数量。	Forecasting models, based on “normal distributions” of risk over short slices of recent time, are notoriously incapable of capturing the real amount of risk in a political system.
此外，它正在与中国周边邻国建立跨太平洋伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership ） ， 而中国则被排除在这一经济与贸易协议之外。	Moreover, it is helping to spearhead the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an economic and trade agreement that excludes China but includes many of its regional neighbors.
但是在掌权近14后，也许与普京最匹配的要算是阿根廷前领导人胡安·贝隆及其传奇妻子伊娃 （ “ 贝隆夫人 ” ） 的跨性别结合体。	But, after nearly 14 years in power, perhaps the best comparison now may be a transgender cross between the former Argentine leader Juan Perón and his legendary wife, Eva (“Evita”).
若要恢复到以往水平，这个过程将会是缓慢且艰辛，从总统和国会大选的准备阶段到结束，美国经济在这段时间内将会变得薄弱。	Progress towards recovery will be slow and difficult, and the US economy will be weak throughout the run-up to November’s presidential and congressional elections.
该平台将提供其自身的资本，以及依风险归类项目所需要的任何技术、经营和管理专业知识，从而编制指数以供投资者跟踪和研究。	The platform would provide its own capital, as well as any technical, operational, and managerial expertise required to classify projects according to risk, thereby enabling the creation of indices that investors could monitor and study.
几乎每个阿拉伯统治者都在某些时候试图通过关闭其当地分社并且迫使卡塔尔统治者钳制其直言无悔的记者来让这一电视台默不作声，但是都没有成功。	Almost every Arab ruler at one time or another attempted to silence the station by closing its local bureau and pressing the Qatari rulers to muzzle its freewheeling journalists. Neither worked.
但是，在中期，绝大部分公司和家庭将不得不面对一个更少支持他们实现潜力、让他们在面对位于更加支持性的体系的竞争对手时处于劣势的体系。	But, in the interim, the vast majority of companies and households will have to cope with systems that do relatively less to help them reach their potential, placing them at a disadvantage vis-à-vis competitors operating in more supportive systems.
以上计划能否具体实现仍有待观察，但能够确定的是，与西班牙不同，意大利的分离主义运动是通过一种非流血革命的方式来壮大发展的。	Whether such plans materialize remains to be seen. What seems certain is that, unlike in Spain, Italy’s separatist movements are gaining ground through a bloodless revolution.
首先，他攻击一本我写的关于我母亲在苏联劳改营所受创伤的书，而后他又协助组织了反对出版《恐惧隐藏在一切背后》的抗议活动。	First, he attacked a book I had written about my mother’s trauma in a Soviet gulag, and then he helped organized protests against the release of Fear Was Behind Everything.
赋予公民言论自由、独立自由选举权和集会自由的法案至关重要，必须让公众明白没有人能凌驾于法律之上，否则转型就有可能遭到破坏。	Legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression, free and independent elections, and freedom of association is crucial, and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law. Anything less will undermine the transition.
著名专栏作家Miguel Angel Granados Chapa上周就曾写道 ： “ 现在墨西哥就差受狗的胯下之辱了 。 ”	The noted columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa wrote last week: “All that’s missing is for Mexico to get peed on by a dog.”
尽管印度政府一度希望这些证据或许会让巴基斯坦软弱的民官政府收紧其社会中的不良分子，但是巴基斯坦当局的反应却是否认抵赖。	While India’s government had briefly hoped that the proof might enable Pakistan’s weak civilian government to rein in the malign elements in its society, the Pakistani authorities’ reaction has been one of denial.
如能制定及执行恰当的方针，十三五规划将极大地改进中国的市场竞争质量、政府问责性以及中国公共基础设施和公共服务的供给。	With the right approach, the 13th Five-Year Plan can bring about significant improvements in the quality of market competition, government accountability, and the provision of public goods and services in China.
但是，随着俄罗斯与印度战略伙伴关系的加强，包括通过一个联合机制购买俄制武器并交付给阿富汗政府，普京也获得了加强与巴基斯坦合作的信心。	But, as Russia’s strategic relationship with India has strengthened, including through a joint mechanism to purchase and deliver Russian weapons to the Afghan government, Putin has gained the confidence to bolster cooperation with Pakistan.
自2003年起，墨西哥对中国的贸易逆差达到九十亿，中国已经成为了墨西哥的第二大贸易伙伴，排名仅列美国之后。	Since 2003, China has become Mexico’s most important trading partner after the United States. Indeed, Mexico’s trade deficit with China reached $9 billion in 2003.
美国自然历史博物馆在其举办的2001年遗传学展览会开幕式上提出了一个挑战性的问题 ： “ 基因组革命已经来了，你准备好了吗 ？ ”	As the American Museum of Natural History provocatively asked at the 2001 opening of its genetics exhibition: “The genomic revolution is here – are you ready?”
最近关于建立更广泛的贸易口岸和银行分支的协议是一个很好的起点，巴基斯坦已经采取了一些动作回报印度所提供的实质上的最惠国贸易地位。	Recent agreements to establish more border trading posts and bank branches are good starting points, and Pakistan has already made some moves to reciprocate India’s offer of Most Favored Nation trading status under a different name.
紧接着亲三架马车政府垮台，随后在2015年1月，我们的激进左翼联盟政府上台，受命去挑战这些“救助”的基本逻辑。	The fallout was that the government collapsed and, in January 2015, our Syriza government was elected with a mandate to challenge the very logic of these “bailouts.”
这可能令人惊奇，因为在20世纪八九十年代，大部分布拉沃河（Rio Bravo，北美称为格兰德河，Rio Grande）以南国家从右翼独裁过渡到民主。	This might seem surprising, because most countries south of the Río Bravo (known to North Americans as the Rio Grande) moved from right-wing dictatorship to democracy in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
但两国情况已变化巨大，今天，同样这些公司更可能将中国企业视为竞争对手 — — 不仅在中国市场，甚至也在整个世界市场。	But the business landscape has changed dramatically, and today these same companies are more likely to view Chinese firms as competitors – not only in China, but around the world as well.
布鲁塞尔 — — 当各种问题像在欧洲一样累积时（英国退欧决策后接踵而来的是土耳其的政变失败 ） — —吸引人们注意力的往往是最近发生的问题。	BRUSSELS – When problems accumulate, as in Europe – where the failed coup in Turkey comes hard on the heels of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union – attention is often focused on the most recent issue to arise.
叙利亚多部领土已经成为极端主义思想的温床和恐怖分子的聚居地，这让人想起了20世纪90年代伊朗东境的情况，也令我深感忧虑。	I am also concerned that parts of Syrian territory have become breeding grounds for extremist ideologies and rallying points for terrorists, which is reminiscent of the situation on our eastern border in the 1990’s.
此外，这一趋势应该因为以下事实而得到确认：这一正向生产率冲击反映了全球资本-劳动比率的下降，而该比率的下降又是因为中国和印度工人融入全球经济造成的。	Moreover, this tendency should have been accentuated by the fact that the productivity shock reflected a decline in the global capital-to-labor ratio implied by the integration of Chinese and Indian workers into the global economy.
日本对中国新出现的地区强势表示担忧是正确的，而安倍最近的外交举动 — — 强化日本与东南亚、澳大利亚和印度的关系 — — 也不难理解。	Japan is right to be concerned about China’s new regional assertiveness, and Abe’s recent diplomatic push to strengthen Japan’s relations in Southeast Asia, and with Australia and India, is understandable in that context.
结果导致印度29个州议会每六个月就要举行投票，每一次投票在某种意义上都是就新德里政府举行的全民公决。	The result is a vote in some or other of India’s 29 state assemblies every six months or so, each one acting as a sort of referendum on the government in New Delhi.
但接下来，人类会培养出一个新物种和一股新民权运动（我会十分乐于加入其中 ） ， 要求给予Nexus自由和与肯一样的权利 — — 包括基本生活工资、最低福利和选举权。	But then humanity will have spawned a new species and a new civil rights movement (which I would gladly join) demanding freedom for Nexus and equal rights with Ken – including a living wage, minimum benefits, and enfranchisement.
不管你愿不愿意承认，欧元区是欧盟的前哨，因为拥有27个成员国的欧盟既没有意愿，也没有能力加快政治统一日程。	Like it or not, the eurozone will have to act as the EU’s avant-garde, because the EU as a whole, with its 27 member states, will be neither willing nor able to accelerate political unification.
处于世界经济中心外围的国家与更为发达的国家相比往往更加贫穷，并比他们更加依赖商品贸易，而且他们单独2009年就必须偿还超过1.4万亿美元的银行贷款。 没有国际援助，这些贷款就无法周转。	Countries on the periphery tend to be poorer and more dependent on commodities than the more developed world, and they must repay more than $1.4 trillion in bank loans in 2009 alone. These loans cannot be rolled over without international assistance.
通货膨胀的终结和所谓“大温和时期 ” （ the great moderation ） — —人们以此来描述最近30年经济动荡几乎消失的现象 — — 构成了某种基础，在此基础之上，世界的大部分都经历了自由化过程，信心、贸易与繁荣也得到增进。	The end of inflation and “the great moderation” of the past three decades were fundamental to the liberalization of large parts of the world and to increased confidence, trade, and prosperity.
尤其在涉及到环境保护和社会凝聚力的问题上，我们不仅犯下了一系列错误，更大的问题是未能采取行动保障长期可持续发展。	And we are compounding these serial miscarriages with a grand failure to act on longer-term sustainability, particularly when it comes to the planet and social cohesion.
他们想要在九月份加息，这样就可以在十二月在此加息(甚至在知道数据之前 ) ， 而且他们不会就此罢休。	They want to go in September so that they can go again in December (even before knowing the data)—and they won’t stop there either.
发自米兰 — — 直到最近一段时间，各国的所谓中等收入过渡阶段大多都是被忽视的 — — 有一部分原因是本应是过渡的阶段往往会沦为一个陷阱。	MILAN – Until relatively recently, countries’ so-called middle-income transitions were largely ignored – in part because what was supposed to be a transition often became a trap.
他莫名其妙地哄骗意大利人相信他们的经济和社会一切都好，即使在2008年全球经济危机爆发初期局势明显很糟时也不例外。	He somehow lulled Italians into believing that all was well in their economy and society, even in the wake of the 2008 global economic crisis, when plainly it was not.
这种情况当然有好的一面，但也伴随着严重的危险因素 — — 首先就是优秀新闻标准的丧失，就像以往在传统媒体机构所执行的那样。	This has its benefits, but it also carries serious risks – beginning with the loss of journalistic standards of excellence, like those typically enforced within established media organizations.
在柏拉图的《申辩篇 》 （ Apology）中，苏格拉底号召检讨生活 — — 严格自省，提出困难、异端乃至令人难以接受的问题。	In Plato’s Apology, Socrates advocates for the examined life – the habit of rigorous self-reflection and posing hard, heterodox, and possibly upsetting questions.
贫穷的农民可能没钱在这上面投资，或者没有这样做的动机－如果水能直接从公开的来源获得或者如果政府对这种水的使用提供补助。	Poor farmers may lack the capital to invest in it, or may lack the incentive to do so if water is taken directly from publicly available sources or if the government is subsidizing its use.
对于大多数以色列人而言，即使他们在加沙地带撤军后投票选举奥尔默特作为沙龙的遗产的继承人，他也只还是一个意外的总理。	For most Israelis, even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon’s legacy after the Gaza disengagement, Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister.
科学家和精神健康专业人士在主导型抑郁症的理解和治疗方面已取得重大的进展，包括发现了血清素和去甲肾上腺素等脑化学物的不平衡所起的作用。	Scientists and mental health professionals have made major strides in understanding and treating major depression, including the discovery of the role played by imbalances in brain chemicals such as serotonin and noradrenaline.
如果希腊政府当时没有进行这一调整，国内需求和就业率当然也会维持高位 — — 但进口和庞大的外部赤字也会不断上升。	If the Greek government had not made such an adjustment, domestic demand and employment would certainly have remained higher – but so would imports and large external deficits.
当地政府对新居民区该建在离海岸多远的地方心存顾虑，这也加重了那些被迫与陌生人一起住在陌生地区的临时住所的灾民的担心。	Local governments worry about how far from the coast new residential areas should be built, amplifying concerns about the future for people who are being forced to live with strangers in temporary housing in an unfamiliar area.
它既不能征税，也不能对外宣战或解散政府（即使在理论上它可以集体解散欧盟委员会的所有成员，即所谓的“核选择 ” ， 而这是不太可能被采用的 ） 。	It can’t raise taxes, declare war, or sack a government (even though in theory it can dismiss all the members of the European Commission en masse, the so-called “nuclear option” that is unlikely ever to be used).
政府已利用国家决定计划推出了几项雄心勃勃的目标，包括承诺到2030年实现零砍伐，并恢复该国流域的森林生态系统。	The government has used its INDC to set several ambitious goals, including commitments to zero deforestation by the year 2030 and to restoring forest ecosystems in the country’s watersheds.
那些一再无视削减过量赤字建议或是捏造官方统计的政府，他们的欧盟基金都将被冻结，同时还将剥夺他们的投票权。	Countries that repeatedly ignore recommendations for reducing excessive deficits, and those that manipulate official statistics, should have their EU funds frozen and their voting rights suspended.
在老龄化且不断减少的人口条件下，日本政府必须找到办法鼓励更多妇女去工作，引导日本老人留在工作岗位，并发展更有利于家庭的劳动力政策。	With an aging and shrinking population, Japan’s government must find ways to encourage more women to work, entice older Japanese to remain in the labor force, and develop more family-friendly labor policies.
所有人都必须反思这对学习、工作的性质以及各类相关利益方在确保全世界工人都能实现其潜力方面的角色和责任的意义。	All must rethink what it means to learn, the nature of work, and the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders in ensuring that workers around the world are able to fulfill their potential.
在更加技术导向的经济体，如美国、英国和北欧国家，一个风险是传统宏观经济模型将高估来自劳动力的成本压力。	In the more tech-oriented economies, like the US, the United Kingdom, and the Nordic countries, there is a risk that traditional macroeconomic models will overestimate the cost pressure from labor.
这一不遵守和去合法化的自我加强循环的一个有害副产品是对总体全球经济造成了损害，特别是对最需要外国投资的发展中国家。	The unfortunate byproduct of this self-reinforcing cycle of non-compliance and delegitimation is damage to the global economy in general, and, in particular, to the developing countries that are most in need of foreign investment.
即使手上已有数十个可靠的投资项目可供选择，但诺贝尔经济学奖获得者们通过对比数据发现打击营养不良的措施会是最有作用的选项之一。	Even with dozens of compelling investments to choose from, Nobel laureate economists poring over the data found that measures to combat malnutrition were among the most powerful options.
简言之，IMF不应该让欧洲的顾虑 — — 不管是关于传染还是关于债务偿付 — — 成为其决策的决定性因素。	In short, the IMF should not have made Europe’s concerns, about contagion or debt repayment, decisive in its decision-making.
也门总统阿里·阿卜杜拉·萨利赫（Ali Abdullah Salih）经常利用也门的瓦哈比教派来打击其国内的竞争对手 — — 开始是共产主义者，后来是扎伊迪什叶派（Zaidis ） ， 最后是什叶派青年运动（Huthis ） 。	President Ali Abdullah Salih has regularly used Yemeni Wahhabis to defeat his domestic opponents – first the Communists, then the Zaidis, and then the Huthis.
再度爱不分西方国家，普京遭人唾弃，习近平也信誉扫地，而穆罕默德王储作为改革家的名声也大大受损，或许已经无法修复。	In the majority of the Western world, Putin is regarded as an outcast, Xi is flirting with a similar loss of credibility, and Prince Mohammed’s reputation as a reformer has been severely damaged, perhaps beyond repair.
因此这次种族灭绝并不能归罪于塞尔维亚，即便塞尔维亚政府为马尔维奇和他的同僚们支付薪水，同时也给他们提供财政和军事援助。	The genocide could not therefore be imputed to Serbia, even if the Serbian government was paying salaries to Mladic and his colleagues, as well as providing them with financial and military assistance.
现在很多人认为巴希尔将竭力阻止全民公决实施，或者将公决结果当作与南方再启战端的借口 — — 这会给非洲之角带来毁灭性的后果。	Many now believe that Bashir will seek to prevent the referendum from taking place, or to use its result as a pretext to return to war with the South – with devastating consequences across the Horn of Africa.
会上英国和德国都出错了牌：英国首相大卫·卡梅伦把英国从欧洲孤立了出来，而德国总理默克尔则让欧元区完全脱离了现实。	Both Britain and Germany played the wrong game: British Prime Minister David Cameron isolated Britain from Europe, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel isolated the eurozone from reality.
他们的结论是 ， “ GDP中的设备投资占比每上升3或4个百分点，就与劳动者人均GDP增​每年1%的增​长相关 。 ”	They concluded that, “an increase of three or four percentage points in the share of GDP devoted to equipment investment is associated with an increase in GDP per worker of one percent per year.”
切断上述联系的努力并不成功，这一点从克里姆林宫不接受美国总统奥巴马双方削减核武器库存的提议就可以证实。	Progress on various efforts to sever this link have not been very encouraging, as was recently demonstrated by the Kremlin’s negative reaction to US President Barack Obama’s proposal that both sides cut their nuclear stockpiles.
即将上任的总统及其周围的顾问将面对压力迅速解决所有这些关注和问题，但他们在上述领域循序渐进才是明智之举。	The incoming president and those around him will come under pressure to address all these issues and concerns quickly, but they would be well advised to take their time.
面临普遍的商品短缺和市场瘫痪（包括外汇）的马杜罗政府已经失去了对国民大会的控制，反对派正在寻求通过宪法途径缩短他的任期。	Facing widespread shortages of goods and malfunctioning markets, including for foreign exchange, his government has already lost control of the National Assembly, and the opposition is now seeking to shorten his term by constitutional means.
如今欧盟正处于各国国内政治辩论的中心，而这些辩论越来越多地涵盖事关欧元区和整个欧洲计划存续的存在性问题。	Now, the EU is at the center of domestic political debates, which increasingly include existential questions about the survival of the eurozone and the entire European project.
美元升值25%将让进口成本下降20 % （ 正好抵消进口价格因为20%的税收而上涨的幅度 ） ， 同时提高美国出口品对外国买家的成本（正好抵消20%的隐含补贴 ） 。	A 25% rise in the dollar lowers the cost of imports by 20% (just enough to offset the increase in import prices caused by the 20% tax), while raising the cost of US exports to foreign buyers (just enough to offset the implied 20% subsidy).
在我们等待肯尼亚全民基本收入试点的结果并预测智能机器人将来会消灭工作的同时，我们需要对那些应对工人当前面临挑战的现有项目进行升级和强化。	While we await the results of the Kenyan UBI pilot and anticipate the future destruction of jobs by intelligent robots, we need to modernize and strengthen existing programs that address the challenges workers face today.
有鉴于此，正如中国农村减贫工作的成功可以作为其他国家的榜样一样，其他国家管理城市贫困的成功可以 — — 而且也应当 — — 有助于指导中国的工作。	Given this, just as China’s successful efforts to reduce rural poverty can serve as a model for others, other countries’ successes in managing urban poverty can – and should – help to guide China’s efforts.
而与FCL类似的预防和流动性额度（Precautionary and Liquidity Line ） ， 虽然门槛更低，但也只得两个受援国。	The FCL-like Precautionary and Liquidity Line, which has an even lower bar for eligibility, has only two takers.
从已故普拉哈拉德到贾德普•普拉胡的管理思想家已经向人们展示了如何重新配置产业，从而以洁净而廉价地方式制造高质量产品。	And management thinkers from the late C. K. Prahalad to Jaideep Prabhu have shown how industry can be reconfigured to produce high-quality products cheaply and cleanly.
在1999年启动欧元时摆脱了“欧洲病夫”外号的德国并没有尝试去激发自身的活力，而是通过削减成本来应对。	Written off as the “sick man of Europe” when the euro was launched in 1999, Germany responded not by boosting dynamism, but by cutting costs.
该技术可以成为消灭许多致命疾病的福音，也可能隐含严重的 — — 并且可能是完全不可预料的 — — 风险。	While the technology could prove a boon in the fight against many deadly diseases, it also implies serious – and potentially entirely unpredictable – risks.
自从十九世纪中叶以来，西方社会一直依靠它在技术上的创新和科学上的大胆行为来提高它的影响力和实现增长。	Since the mid-nineteenth century, the West has depended on technical innovation and scientific derring-do for its influence and growth.
在他们最新出版的重要著作《完全市场 》 （ Radical Markets）一书中，经济学家格林·维尔（Glen Weyl）和埃里克·波斯纳（Eric Posner）更进了一步，认为大科技企业应该为你的数据付费而不是据为己用。	In their important recent book Radical Markets, the economists Glen Weyl and Eric Posner go one step further and argue that Big Tech should have to pay for your data, instead of claiming it for their own use.
所谓的“沃克尔规则 ” （ Volcker Rule，由前美联储主席保罗·沃克尔提出）便是迷你版的格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案，它旨在禁止吸储的商业银行从事现在看来属于危险活动的衍生品交易。	The so-called “Volcker Rule,” proposed by Paul Volcker, the former US Federal Reserve chairman, is a mini-Glass-Steagall, aiming to bar deposit-taking commercial banks from derivatives trading – now seen to be a dangerous activity for them.
所有重要的事情都是为了取悦他们的企业金主，金主们将用献金来回来这个党派，这些献金将被用来换取选票，从而确保一个由企业驱动的政治议程不断延续下去。	All that matters is pleasing their corporate sponsors, who will reward the party with contributions, which will be used to buy votes, thereby ensuring the perpetuation of a corporate-driven political agenda.
在这方面我们掌握的信息很少，只有从国际并购中了解的有限信息和朝鲜带出材料上探测出的某些高浓缩铀（HEU）痕迹。	We have scant information about this, beyond some limited information about international acquisitions and some detection of traces of highly enriched uranium (HEU) on materials brought out of North Korea.
副总统迪克·切尼在酝酿伊拉克战争时多次表示这样的担心，宣称萨达姆·侯赛因为了“控制全球很大一部分能源供应 ” ， 在制造大量大规模杀伤性武器。	Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated these fears in the run-up to the Iraq War, claiming that Saddam Hussein was building a massive arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to “take control of a great portion of the world’s energy supplies.”
事实上，论文的作者们发现超过6%的抵押贷款错报了借款人的房屋使用状况，同时有7%的抵押贷款记录并未公开二次质押状况。	In fact, the authors find that more than 6% of mortgage loans misreport the borrower’s occupancy status, while 7% do not disclose second liens.
生物燃料技术其实一石四鸟：改善能源安全、促进垃圾回收、减少温室气体排放和（往往在农村地区）创造就业机会。	Biofuel technology kills four birds with one stone: It improves energy security, recycles waste, reduces greenhouse-gas emissions, and produces jobs (often in rural areas).
这种做法不仅虚伪；还妨碍就重要问题进行有建设性的探讨和质疑，更糟的是，挑战了现代文明赖以存在的科学流程和体系。	Not only is this disingenuous; it also prevents constructive discussion of important issues and, worse, calls into question the scientific processes and institutions on which modern civilization depends.
正如弗雷德·伯格斯坦提醒我们的那样，这一机制已经以1980年国际货币基金组织谈判过的“替换账户”的形式存在了。	As Fred Bergsten has reminded us, the mechanism is already available in the form of the “substitution account” that was negotiated in the IMF in 1980.
比如，低利率和资本成本增加了未来现金流的相对吸引力，从而增加了资本投资，这便是系统对高储蓄、低消费的自动平衡机制。	For example, lower interest rates and cost of capital raise the relative attractiveness of cash flows further in the future, and capital investment increases – the system’s natural homeostatic response to higher savings and lower consumption.
但事实上正是蒋介石委员长的儿子，已故前总统蒋经国推动了一场空前的民主改革，最终为陈水扁及其遭到查禁的民进党最终获得选举胜利铺平了道路。	But in fact, it was the late President Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who instituted the unprecedented democratic reforms that paved the way for the eventual electoral triumph of Chen’s formerly banned DPP.
虽然没有人知道什么会破坏威尔克斯盆地的稳定，但我们可以肯定温室气体排放造成的进一步全球变暖会加大这样的风险。	Although no one knows precisely what might destabilize the Wilkes Basin, we can be fairly certain that further global warming, caused by greenhouse-gas emissions, will increase the risk.
足够热、能够迅速产生就业岗位的经济 — — 包括最近的美联储主席耶伦在内的一些人称之为“高压经济 ” — —最终会给工人带来更高的实际工资和收入。	An economy running hot enough to create jobs at a rapid rate – what some, most recently Fed Chair Janet Yellen, have called a “high-pressure economy” – will eventually lead to higher real wages and incomes for workers.
胡锦涛统治下的中国可能已经找到了其发展模式，那就是列宁主义的资本主义，对更为民主的政府模式毫无愿望。	China under Hu has perhaps found its development model: a form of Leninist capitalism with no aspirations toward a more democratic form of governance.
现在的危险在于马克龙只能实现一个表面上的欧元区预算，以换取对国家预算的更紧的控制，而这有可能造成经济伤害和政治副作用。	The danger now is that Macron will achieve only a token eurozone budget in exchange for even tighter controls on national budgets, which would prove economically harmful and politically poisonous.
大银行高管通常希望增加他们的银行的杠杆，这往往是因为他们有各种形式的担保 — — 特别是存款保险以及以有利条件从央行获得融资。	Big banks’ executives often want to increase their institutions’ leverage, typically because they have various forms of guarantee – in particular, deposit insurance and access to central-bank financing on advantageous terms.
后冷战时代不是真正的“时代 ” ， 而是一个从双边对峙的冷战最终分析仍存在两个超级大国的更加复杂的国际秩序的逐渐转变时期。	The post-Cold War era was not really an “era,” but rather a gradual transition from a bilateral Cold War to a more complex international order that still involves, in the final analysis, two world powers.
在这样的背景下，全球经济的恢复力 — — 至少到目前为止 — — 显得尤其令人瞩目（尽管没人知道，全球经济如果能在更加稳定的环境中运行，表现会如何 ） 。	In this context, the global economy’s resilience – at least so far – is all the more remarkable (though it is of course impossible to know how the economy would be performing in a more stable political environment).
正如中国古代军事家孙子所建议的一样，毛泽东选择在全世界都关注朝鲜战争时吞并西藏，同样他也选择了一个完美的时机入侵印度。	Just as Mao Zedong started his invasion of Tibet while the world was preoccupied with the Korean War, so he chose a perfect time to invade India, as recommended by the ancient strategist Sun Tzu.
从拥有核武器的贱民，到与总统谈笑风生，毫不奇怪金正恩想要第二次峰会以巩固他新获得的国际合法性以及在全球舞台上的地位。	Having gone from nuclear-armed pariah to presidential negotiating partner, it is little wonder that Kim would want a second summit to consolidate his newfound international legitimacy and position in the global limelight.
毕竟，艾尔多安长期以来一直警告，土耳其绝不会容忍库尔德军事力量盘踞在其南境；最新的进攻行动似乎也表明，他在用行动证明这一点。	After all, Erdoğan has long warned that Turkey would never tolerate a Kurdish military presence on the country’s southern border; the recent offensive would seem to suggest that his words are being met with action.
如果这种说法正确，那么这份协议能够成为传播信息的最新工具，同时，这份协议也表达了贫困国家迎接国外直接投资的决心。	If this view is correct, an agreement could create new instruments for disseminating information, while signaling poor countries’ commitment to welcoming FDI.
虽然现阶段的美国总统选举进程并不特别侧重于政策，但随着选战迅速落幕，必将有人开始执政并实施各类政策。	While the US presidential election is not particularly focused on policy at the moment, the campaign will soon end, at which point people will govern and policies will be adopted.
很多人自然而然地将钦奈洪水和巴黎会谈相联，认为这次毁灭性降雨证明了人类活动对世界气候造成了灾难性的影响。	Inevitably, many linked the flooding in Chennai to the talks in Paris, seeing the devastating rains as proof of the catastrophic consequences of human action on the world’s weather.
好消息是，在发展政策方面已经取得了世纪进步，而且在意识形态不同的背后也存在一定程度的趋同 — — 不是关于什么才是有用的，而是关于我们应该怎��看待发展政策。	The good news is that there has been real progress in development policy, and, beneath the doctrinal differences, is a certain convergence – not on what works, but on how we should think about and do development policy.
更有可能的局面 — — 就像我们在希腊所看到的那样 — — 是中国将在一切尘埃落定之后派出企业寻找投资机会。	The more likely outcome – as we are seeing in Greece – is that China will unleash its companies to pursue investment opportunities after the dust settles.
尽管目前的关注目光集中在加泰罗尼亚地区的分离要求上，但西班牙在一些积极的关键角度上，在西方民主国家中显得鹤立鸡群。	Despite the attention now focused on the Catalonia region’s secession bid , Spain now stands out among Western democracies in a few critical – and positive – ways.
有时错误直到成为工作论文之后才被发觉，莱因哈特和罗格夫的论文就属于这种情形；也有可能在发表后才被发觉，诺贝尔奖获得者阿罗（Ken Arrow）就遇到过这种情形，他在证明他著名的不可能定理时犯了一个错误，不得不做出纠正。	Sometimes errors are not discovered until later, when they are working papers, as with Reinhart and Rogoff, or after publication, as with Nobel laureate Ken Arrow, who had to correct a mistake in the proof of his famous impossibility theorem.
欧盟号称是全球气候变化领头羊，但其领导人放任欧盟碳排交易机制（Emissions Trading Scheme）碳定价因为鲁莽的碳信用过度供给而崩溃。	The European Union claims the mantle of global leadership on climate change, yet its leaders have allowed the price of carbon in the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme to collapse, owing to reckless over-supply of carbon credits.
2015年，美国对101个国家存在贸易赤字 — — 这是一个源自储蓄短缺的多边问题，它无法通过针对具体国家的“疗法”解决。	The US had trade deficits with 101 countries in 2015 – a multilateral problem stemming from a saving shortfall that cannot be effectively addressed through country-specific “remedies.”
今日的欧洲不需要能够煽起民众狂热的传奇领袖，而需要能在一个复杂而多维的政治环境下工作的、受当地人民爱戴的领导人。	Europe today does not need inspirational leaders who can whip up a populist frenzy. Instead, it needs locally respected leaders who are capable of working in a complex and multi-dimensional political world.
然而调和左右两派当然主要靠阿里埃勒·沙龙（Ariel Sharon）的力量，虽然仍处在昏迷状态，但沙龙的崇高威望却丝毫没有受到影响。	But the rapprochement itself is, of course, mainly the work of Ariel Sharon, whose influence is by no means diminished because he is in a coma.
只有那些现在能借进长期贷款，锁定目前较低的实际利率，并投资扩大规模的企业可以在国内下注，赌利率上涨。	Only businesses that can borrow long-term now, lock in a low real interest rate, and invest in expanding their capacity can make the domestic bet that interest rates will rise.
1953年以来，美国一直反对伊朗的自治和经济发展，手段包括各种秘密行动、支持1953—1979年间的极权统治、军事支持伊朗的敌人，以及长达数十年的制裁等。	Since 1953, the US has opposed Iran’s self-rule and economic development through covert action, support for authoritarian rule during 1953-79, military backing for its enemies, and decades-long sanctions.
改善妇女条件的第一步必然是强化她们的性和生殖卫生和权利 — — 在这个问题上，非洲的一些指标在全世界排名倒数。	The first step to improving conditions for women must be to strengthen their sexual and reproductive health and rights – an issue concerning which Africa has some of the world’s worst indicators.
但是，对于恐怖主义，我们营造了一种恐惧氛围，这种氛围往往远甚于实际风险，给恐怖分子按上了过大的实力，从一开始就自己吓唬着自己。	When it comes to terrorism, however, we have created an atmosphere of fear that is wildly disproportionate to the actual risk, handing power to terrorists unnecessarily and harming ourselves preemptively.
如果这些新药针对的是那些影响富人或生活在有全民健康保险的国家的人的疾病，药厂就能为新发明的药品注册专利。	If they target diseases that affect affluent people, or people living in countries with national health insurance, they will be able to patent any new drugs they discover.
(某些专家预计，到本世纪中叶，人一般可以活到110岁到115岁。 也许有人会思考这对于像婚姻那样的其他社会习俗产生什么影响，但是我以后再讨论这一问题。	(With some experts predicting that individuals will routinely live beyond 110-115 years by mid-century, one might wonder what all this will do to other social conventions such as marriage, but I will leave this thought to another day.)
在低收入国家中，所有医疗保健支出中有一半（约占GDP的2.5 ％ ） 属于非预算款项开支，而这一比重在中等收入国家仅为GDP的2 ％ 。	In low-income countries, half of all health-care spending (about 2.5% of GDP) is out-of-pocket (compared to 2% in middle-income countries).
去年，中投公司的最大投资项目是收购了法国能源巨头GDF Suez 30 % （ 32亿美元）的股权。	The Chinese Investment Corporation’s biggest investment last year was a 30% ($3.2 billion) stake in the gas and oil exploration and production sector of the French energy giant GDF Suez.
在当时的大背景下，政府不愿去强制减轻债务，房地产价格大幅高估而某些领域的实际工资过高，当时如果能有适当的通货膨胀，应该是帮助极大的。	Back then, against a backdrop of government reluctance to force debt write-downs, along with massively over-valued real housing prices and excessive real wages in some sectors, moderate inflation would have been extremely helpful.
但这样的计划绝非万无一失 — — 这不仅因为很难发现隐蔽的核资产，而且还因为很难对反应堆采取保护措施。	Such plans, however, are by no means foolproof – not least owing to the difficulties of finding concealed nuclear assets and safeguarding reactors.
产业政策 — — 政府干预资源在各部门间的配置或优待某些技术 — — 有助于“婴儿经济体 ” （ infant economy）学习。	Industrial policies – in which governments intervene in the allocation of resources among sectors or favor some technologies over others – can help “infant economies” learn.
他也一直坚守这一规则，尽管缺乏证据显示该规则会比1970年代以来美联储的实际政策决策取得更好的结果。	And he has long clung to this rule, despite a lack of evidence that it would have delivered better results than the Fed’s actual policy decisions since the 1970s.
2017年美国与世界102个国家出现商品贸易逆差，而2016年中国则与世界169个国家拥有贸易盈余。	The US had merchandise trade deficits with 102 countries in 2017, whereas China had trade surpluses with 169 countries in 2016.
The real failure was that there was no agreement about how to achieve the lofty goal of saving the planet, no agreement about reductions in carbon emissions, no agreement on how to share the burden, and no agreement on help for developing countries.	The real failure was that there was no agreement about how to achieve the lofty goal of saving the planet, no agreement about reductions in carbon emissions, no agreement on how to share the burden, and no agreement on help for developing countries.
钱美国贸易代表米奇·坎托（Mickey Kantor）还记得克林顿与国会民主党讨价还价、说服他们加入共和党的行列通过NAFTA、克服两大政党的保护主义的情景。	Former US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recalls Clinton’s horse-trading with congressional Democrats to persuade them to join Republicans in passing NAFTA, overcoming both parties’ protectionist wings.
他抨击民主党总统候选人布莱恩（William Jennings Bryan）只不过是伊利诺伊州黑老大奥特戈尔德（John Peter Altgeld）的傀儡。	He denounced Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan as a mere puppet of the sinister governor of Illinois, John Peter Altgeld.
其实，近年来国际石油储备增长的绝大部分并不依赖新油田的发现，而是主要依靠提高现有油田产量以及开采速度的提高。	In fact, the bulk of recent growth in world reserves is due not to new discoveries, but mainly to reserve growth and improved recovery rates.
但是批判者们指出，最好的经理未必报酬最高，他们的市场不透明，而且董事会成员在确定薪金时往往偏向于公司的总裁。	But critics argue that the best managers are not necessarily the best paid, that the market for them is not transparent, and that boards of directors are often partial to their presidents when setting compensation.
这样做能使得政府和个人在加入恐怖主义阵营前三思而后行；也为那些反对实施恐怖主义行动的国际行动争取更多支持提供方便。	Doing so will make governments and individuals think twice before becoming a party to terrorism; it should also make it less difficult to garner support for international action against those who nevertheless carry it out.
上述势头将随新全球协议的订立而继续强化，相关协议不仅可以稳定碳市场，还能加速洁净能源行业的资金投入。 与此同时，协议也可以确保相对脆弱的国家不被边缘化。	This momentum would continue to grow with a new global treaty that not only brings certainty to carbon markets and triggers accelerated investments in clean-tech industries, but that also ensures that more vulnerable countries are not marginalized.
而俄国却恰恰相反，它任由通货膨胀把退休职工的收入侵蚀得一干二净，实际等于将依靠退休金维持生计的老年人抛到了一边。	Russia, by contrast, has essentially abandoned its pensioners by inflating away the value of their incomes.
因此，法律应该做出修订，通过要求所有退休金顾问必须时时刻刻根据客户的最佳利益行事来尽可能多地排除利益冲突。	That is why the law should be amended to eliminate as many potential conflicts of interest as possible, by requiring all retirement advisers to act in their clients' best interests at all times.
但是尽管政治 — — 至少目前为止 — — 并未像与其那样阻碍全球经济增长，但是政治动荡的长期代价可能更加高昂。	But while politics is not, at least for now, impeding global growth nearly as much as one might have thought, the long-run costs of political upheaval could be far more serious.
2007至2009年间，美国、英国、西班牙、爱尔兰，冰���和迪拜的股票、信贷以及房地产泡沫爆破导致了严重的金融危机和经济损失。	The collapse from 2007 to 2009 of equity, credit, and housing bubbles in the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, Iceland, and Dubai led to severe financial crises and economic damage.
从这个角度讲，按照祖马的说法，黑人个体投资者已拥有股票市场10%的成绩已经非常亮眼，因为市场主要掌握在机构而非个人投资者手中。	From this perspective, the fact that individual black investors, according to Zuma, already own 10% of the stock market is impressive, given the predominance of institutional, not individual, investors.
我们组织了方方面面的发言人，包括四位间谍软件提供商，但在台上我们礼貌地将他们的产品称为“广告软件 ” ； 一名美国联邦贸易委员会官员；几家反间谍软件厂商；以及一位著名的间谍软件研究者。	We assembled a diverse set of speakers, including four spyware makers, though we politely called their products “adware” on stage; an official from the US Federal Trade Commission; several anti-spyware vendors; and a well-known spyware researcher.
至少在进行竞选活动时，巴拉克·奥巴马拥有摇喊派教徒的所有魅力，在面对公众时闪烁着伟大传道者的修辞光芒。	Barack Obama, at least when he began his campaign, had all the charisma of the holy roller, turning on the crowds with the rhetorical spark of a great evangelist.
但预测危机却需要对各个经济学领域都有所涉猎的人 — — 正如我们需要一个优秀的全科医师去辨认某种外来病一样。	Yet, to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas – just as it takes a good general practitioner to recognize an exotic disease.
在巴勒斯坦方面，马哈茂德·阿巴斯领导的巴勒斯坦民族权力组织在2006年失去了对加沙地区的控制权 — — 该地区如今掌握在由哈马斯领导的一个非法政府手里 — — 并因此失去了代表全体巴勒斯坦人进行谈判的资格。	On the Palestinian side, Mahmoud Abbas’s Palestinian Authority lost control in 2006 of the Gaza Strip – now ruled by an illegitimate Hamas-led government – and thus cannot speak anymore for all Palestinians.
恰恰因为国际货币基金组织是超越地方政治的国际机构，因此就更应当保持谨慎，避免在2009年10月总统大选准备阶段给予竞选一方所需的一切弹药。	The Fund, precisely because it is an international institution that is above local politics, should be careful not to give one of the competing sides all the ammunition it needs in the run-up to the October 2019 presidential election.
在民主制度的推动下，印度的政治决策分散化了，但相当多的经济决策当局仍嵌在新德里僵硬的官僚体制中，阻挠着经济增长。	India was compelled by its democracy to pursue a politically decentralizing route, yet much economic decision-making authority remained embedded in New Delhi’s ossified bureaucracy, retarding growth.
在伦敦，即使是亲欧洲派也更愿意在国家层面上解决英国仍然面临的金融业挑战；结构上的差异意味着这是一个可以理解的选择。	In London, even pro-Europeans prefer to address Britain’s remaining financial-sector challenges on a national basis; the differences in structure make that an understandable choice.
毫不奇怪，全世界人民在前往美国之前都要三思，在特朗普的禁令首次提出后的几周中，机票价格预测应用Hopper上的赴美航班搜索量下降了17 % 。	Not surprisingly, people from around the world are thinking twice about visiting the US, with the airfare prediction app Hopper registering a 17% decline in online searches for flights to the US in the weeks after Trump’s ban was first proposed.
事实已经证明“禽流感”可以由鸟类向人类传染，现在连猫类也不能幸免，这预示着它可能成为下一种全球性致命疾病。	“Bird flu” has already shown that it can jump from fowl to humans, and now even to cats, which indicates that it might be the next global killer.
说到半岛的新闻表现，电视台由德高望重的职业记者，而不是挥舞政策利斧的美国或其它官员评判的时代已经一去不返。	As for Al Jazeera's journalistic performance, it is past time that the station be judged by respected professional journalists, not by US or other officials with a policy axe to grind.
政府可能会开始研发自动反击系统，即使这些系统还没有奇爱博士的末日机器那样威力巨大，但仍会将人类带入一个需要承受无数意外后果的世界当中。	Governments may start developing autonomous counterstrike systems that, even if they fall short of Dr. Strangelove’s Doomsday Machine, will usher in a world vulnerable to myriad unintended consequences.
柏林 — — 权力真空已经随英国退欧公投、意大利总理马特奥·伦齐在全民公投中失败并随后辞职以及唐纳德·特朗普当选美国总统在西方和欧洲各国形成。	BERLIN – The United Kingdom’s Brexit vote, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s referendum defeat and subsequent resignation, and Donald Trump’s election as President of the United States have created a power vacuum in the West, and in Europe.
例如，在危机年代，政府采用重商政策无可指责，然而如果这样行事，美国就已经失去了作为自由贸易支持者的道德制高点。	For example, in times of crisis it is no shame for a government to be mercantilist, but by behaving in this way, the US has lost the moral high ground as a champion of free trade.
· 第三，新气候协定应该为经济的根本转型打下基础，其中去碳化应该立刻开始，以实现在2050年左右建成零碳社会的目标。	· Third, the agreement should lay the foundation for a fundamental transformation of the economy, with deep decarbonization beginning immediately, in order to create a zero-carbon society by around 2050.
这意味着要倾听波兰实际领导者、正义与发展党主席卡钦斯基和匈牙利总理欧尔班领衔的反自由政策，并组织持续的对话。	This means listening to, and conducting a continuous dialogue about, the illiberal policies championed by Poland’s de facto leader, Law and Justice party chairman Jarosław Kaczyński, and Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán.
但即便如此，日本的情况也不像很多人想象的那样糟糕，因为日本对中国的风险暴露有限；比如，对华出口只占日本GDP的3 % 。	But even here Japan’s situation is not as dire as many seem to think, owing to its limited exposure to China; for example, exports to China amount to only 3% of Japan’s GDP.
事实上，除非欧洲能够向一体化迈进，否则它将在技术开发、就业创造、生产成本、人才和创造力等诸方面被新兴国家赶超。	Indeed, unless Europeans work toward integration, they may find themselves surpassed by emerging countries in terms of technological development, job creation, production costs, talent, and creativity.
完成向国际枢纽转型的舍内费尔德机场由于技术原因而推迟开放超过一年（这对德国以效率著称的声望构成了某种挑战 ） 。	The opening of Schönefeld Airport, transformed into an international hub, has been delayed for more than a year for technical reasons (a somewhat reassuring challenge to Germany’s reputation for efficiency).
实现这一点不是完全不可能的，因为沙特阿拉伯和也门都具有温和的固有伊斯兰传统，它们可以利用这一传统来反对伊斯兰圣战主义。	This should not be impossible, because both Saudi Arabia and Yemen have moderate, indigenous Islamic traditions that can be mobilized against jihadism.
巴勒斯坦对以色列商品的依赖恶化了这一问题，与此同时，以色列控制着流向约旦河西岸以及被封锁的加沙地带以及在上述两地区之内和之间的物流和人流。	Palestinian dependence on Israeli goods exacerbates the problem, as does Israeli control over the movement of goods and people to, within, and between the West Bank and the blockaded Gaza strip.
电影导演特奥·范霍赫（Theo van Gogh）被杀及清真寺、教堂和伊斯兰学校随后发生的纵火事件上周在荷兰家庭中引起的反思比过去20年里的更多、更深刻。	The murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh and the ensuing arson attacks against mosques, churches, and Islamic schools have caused more soul-searching in Dutch homes in the last week than in the past two decades.
更为重要的是，恢复真相将反击中国人将所有灾难归罪于外部力量的传统本性，并且可能让一个在新兴中国奋力寻找价值的民族获得精神顿悟。	More positively, restoring truth would counter the traditional Chinese instinct to blame all disasters on external forces, and might lead to a spiritual epiphany for a people struggling to find value in the emerging new China.
构成TPP基础的贸易和金融经济学十分简单，早在十九世纪就由英国政治经济学家大卫·李嘉图阐述得一清二楚。	The economics of trade and finance that form the TPP’s foundations are rather simple, and have been known since the British political economist David Ricardo described them in the nineteenth century.
没有人能够确定最近几年美国生产率的提高有多少是由于压榨人力资本取得的，因为这样的东西没有办法进行测量的。	No one can determine how much of America’s productivity gains in recent years have resulted from squeezing human capital, because such things are not measured.
在2007年，中国在医疗、社会保险和失业福利项目上的政府开支总计约880亿美元，即财政预算的15 % ， GDP的2.4 % （ 既远远低于发达民主国家，也远远低于发展中民主国家的一般百分比 ） 。	In 2007, government expenditure on health care, social security, and unemployment welfare programs totaled about $88 billion, or 15% of the fiscal budget and 2.4% of GDP (far below the typical percentage in both developed and developing democracies).
这些堕胎服务提供者承诺危险的“一日堕胎 ” ， 其中可能包括一刀切的各种药物和可能让妇女面临流产不尽、败血症甚至死亡的手术。	These providers promise dangerous “same-day abortions,” which can include an indiscriminate cocktail of pills and operations that put women at risk of incomplete abortions, sepsis, and even death.
我们很少触及能产生整体大于部分之和效应的整合发展金融机构（DFI）动作和私人和慈善项目方面的工作，即使有也流于表面。	We have barely scratched the surface in integrating the efforts of development finance institutions (DFIs) with private and philanthropic initiatives, which could make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
但金砖国家认识到经济实力可以转化为政治影响，于是在2006年召开了首次非正式会议，并在2009年召开了首次领导人峰会。	But, recognizing that economic power could translate into political influence, the BRICS held their first informal meeting in 2006, and their first leaders’ summit in 2009.
由于当前的国际储备货币安排存在以上的缺陷，所以，新的世界货币体系必须建立在真正的全球储备货币基础之上：这种真正的全球储备货币是一个得到世界各国中央银行支持的信用货币。	The deficiencies of current arrangements are why the world monetary system should be based on a truly global reserve currency: a fiduciary currency backed by the world’s central banks.
有了重新开业的银行、发挥作用的货币和偿债延期，国际货币基金组织提供一些短期贷款就可以增强人们的信心，帮助阿根廷克服信心危机。	With banks reopened, a currency that works, and suspension of debt servicing, some short-term IMF loans could boost confidence and help the country overcome its crisis of confidence.
除了这些短期的项目之外，长期分析研究显示，社会经济条件的改善也会起着一定的作用，从科学的角度来说，我们应该关注以下三个方面：	Beyond their short-term benefits to individuals, extensive economic analysis also has demonstrated significant financial benefits to society for years to come. Science points to three things that we can do to level the playing field:
在印刷机、送货卡车、报刊亭或转播塔是将印刷出版物或广播节目送到新闻消费者手中的唯一方式的时候，默认这种审查制度可能是必要的。	Acquiescing to such censorship might have been necessary when printing presses, delivery trucks, news kiosks, or transmission towers were the only way to get printed publications or broadcast programs to news consumers.
洛杉矶 — — 最近麦加发生的踩死千余朝圣者的踩踏事件悲情而有力地提醒人们这座城市在穆斯林世界的份量。	LOS ANGELES – The recent stampede in Mecca, in which more than a thousand pilgrims making the hajj were trampled to death, is a tragic but powerful reminder of the city’s prominence in the Muslim world.
就在最近，在特朗普声称韩国应该为在其领土上部署的10亿美元导弹防御系统买单后，麦克马斯特打电话给韩国国家安全主管承诺美国将承担这一成本。	Just recently, after Trump asserted that South Korea should pay for the deployment of a $1 billion missile-defense system on its territory, McMaster called South Korea’s national security chief to pledge that the US would shoulder the costs.
保障欧洲今天的利益意味着要和土耳其建立牢固的联系 — — 应该说是一种牢不可破的纽带，作为地区安全的基石。	Safeguarding Europe’s interests today means establishing a strong link – indeed an unbreakable bond – with Turkey as a cornerstone of regional security.
7月，安倍所在的自由民主党（LDP）得到了议会两院的控制权 — — 这次彻底的选举胜利带来了多年以来日本领导人最强的政治权力。	In July, Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won control of both houses of parliament – a resounding electoral victory that amounts to the strongest political mandate any Japanese leader has received in many years.
但到目前为止，特朗普表现出对规则和规范漠不关心，表现出对界限的无视，表现出极端的反复无常，以至于民主党和共和党都弥漫着一种不确定和不安的情绪。	But Trump has so far shown such indifference to rules and norms, such a disregard for limits, and such unpredictability, that the prevailing mood among Democrats and Republicans alike is one of uncertainty and unease.
这两个国家都是中东主要力量，目前处于严重对峙状态。 此次出访体现了习近平所主导的更加积极的外交政策方针，特别是在中东。	The visits reflect the more active foreign-policy approach that Xi has spearheaded, particularly in the Middle East.
例如，尼泊尔国会党（Nepali Congress Party）已经选择做反对派，它对毛主义者对民主政治的承诺表示怀疑。	The Nepali Congress Party, for example, has chosen to remain in opposition, dubious of the Maoists’ commitment to democratic politics.
在阿富汗，战术上美军极其依赖巴基斯坦，在不少情形中，美国还鼓励印度削减开发项目，如阿富汗基础设施的重建。	In Afghanistan, America’s military was so tactically dependent on Pakistan that, on several occasions, the US encouraged India to curtail development projects, such as rebuilding Afghanistan’s infrastructure.
但最大的负面效应将出现在加拿大和墨西哥这类与美国有紧密经济联系的国家，或者是德国，日本和新加坡这类深度整合进全球经济的国家。	But the greatest negative impact will be on countries such as Canada and Mexico, which have close trade links with the US economy or those, like Germany, Japan, and Singapore, that are deeply integrated into the global economy.
事实上他认为相比从前的科技进步 — — 例如电力、自来水、内燃机的发明和其他距今一百多年的突破性发明，现在的技术创新都黯然失色。	Indeed, he suggests that today’s technological innovations pale in significance compared to earlier advances like electricity, running water, the internal combustion engine, and other breakthroughs that are now more than a century old.
但“极端”和“异乎寻常”的干旱 — — 也就是最糟糕的一类 — — 规模扩大到覆盖该国领土的6.3 % ， 高于9月中旬的6 % 。	But “extreme” and “exceptional” drought – the worst categories – expanded to cover 6.3% of the country, up from 6% in mid-September.
欧元危机将金融体系推向了破产的边缘，而解决方法是向希腊等国提供刚够避免违约的借款并强制其采取严格的紧缩政策。	The euro crisis pushed the financial system to the verge of bankruptcy, which has been avoided by imposing strict austerity and lending countries like Greece just enough money to avoid default.
美联储已经授权普通银行直接动用它的信贷工具，而欧洲央行（ECB）也不再限制基础货币的供应，反而是银行要求多少流动性，它就提供多少。	The Fed has given ordinary banks direct access to its credit facilities, and the ECB no longer rations the supply of base money, instead providing as much liquidity as banks demand.
在这一思维定势的推动下，俄罗斯上层的重要部门极力恶化俄美关系。 他们特别是在过去几年中取得了某些成功。	As a result of this mindset, key elements in the Russian elite have tried mightily – and with some success, especially in recent years – to bring about a deterioration in Russian-US relations.
对此，我们需要塑造一个能同时对国家政府和民间社会起作用的，崭新的长期政策，这要求我们有足够的耐心和战略持续性。	We are faced with forging a new long-term policy that affects both states and societies. That task requires patience and strategic perseverance.
伊朗政府曾一贯在背后支持什叶派民兵，包括由激进教士萨德尔领导的救世军武装。 但是伊朗人从一开始也和由什业派领导的联合政府成员有着紧密的联系。	The Iranian government had been a major backer of Shiite militia groups, including the Mahdi Army, led by radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.�But the Iranians also had close ties from the beginning with elements of the Shiite-led coalition government.
美国和欧洲（欧盟各成员国政府以及欧盟本身）是联合国难民高级委员会的最大出资者，但许多其他国家政府不愿意承担公平份额。	The United States and Europe (both European Union member governments and the EU itself) are the largest contributors to the UN High Commission on Refugees, but many other governments are unwilling to commit their fair share.
随着新的知识不断扩散到商业活动之中，研究溢出到经济的其他部分，利用奥地利企业东欧子公司所生产的知识也成为东欧经济体实现快速增长的途径之一。	Research spills over to the rest of the economy, as new knowledge diffuses into commercial activities. Tapping the knowledge produced by Austrian subsidiaries was one of the ways Eastern European economies were able to grow so quickly.
因为其中许多激进在成为财务投资者之前就持有国有企业股份，它们的持仓往往十分多样化，通常包括同样的国有企业以及房地产和上市和非上市公司股份。	Because many of them held stakes in state-owned enterprises before becoming financial investors, their holdings tend to be diverse, and often include those same SOEs, as well as real estate and equity stakes in listed and unlisted companies.
税法中鼓励私人投资于困难地区的条款主要是建立“机会区 ” （ Opportunity Zones，OZ，这个词30多年前由纽约州州长马里奥·库默（Mario Cuomo）首次提出 ） 。	The provisions in the tax law to encourage private investment in impoverished areas center on the creation of “Opportunity Zones” (a term coined more than 30 years ago by New York Governor Mario Cuomo).
通过长时期的通货紧缩，他不仅改变了人们的期望和国家经济状况，还大幅提升了美联储在公众、金融市场和政策圈中的形象。	In delivering secular disinflation, he did more than change expectations and economic behavior. He also greatly enhanced the Fed’s standing among the general public, in financial markets, and in policy circles.
奥巴马的首席经济顾问劳伦斯·萨默斯(Larry Summers ) ， 最近也发表了全球化对工人的不利影响的看法。	His chief economic adviser, Larry Summers, has also been vocal of late on globalization’s adverse impact on workers.
正基于此疑问，为了维护自身的主权安全，法国在1966年退出了北约的军事体系（法国1960年成为有核国家 ） 。	Based on that doubt, France – a nuclear power since 1960 – withdrew in 1966 from the Alliance’s permanent centralized military command in order to assert its own deterrent capability.
另一个好消息是，欧洲各国现在已经放弃他们对重新任命货币基金组织总裁的声明（正如美国人对世界银行主席的相关声明 ） 。	Another piece of good news is that the Europeans have now given up their claim on naming the IMF’s managing director (as have the Americans their corresponding claim on the World Bank presidency).
我们也知道，这一冲突风格也是史蒂芬·班农（Stephen Bannon）和史蒂芬·米勒（Stephen Miller）等白宫幕僚的惯用伎俩。	And we know that this confrontational style is the modus operandi of senior White House advisers like Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller.
中国部署了数万名“网警 ” ， 以封锁网站、在网吧中进行巡查、监控移动电话的使用、并追踪互联网上的活跃人士。	China deploys tens of thousands of “ cyber police” to block Web sites, patrol cyber-cafes, monitor the use of cellular telephones, and track down Internet activists.
大约20年前，普林斯顿大学的艾伦·布林德（Alan Blinder）集合了包括我在内的多名经济学家一起考察已有的关于利润分享和生产率之间的关系的研究。	Some 20 years ago, Alan Blinder of Princeton University corralled a number of economists, including me, to examine existing studies on the link between profit-sharing and productivity.
其一，独裁制度本身丑陋不堪，难以被接受；其次，独裁制度排除了伊斯兰各政党在政治体系中参政议政的可能。	First, dictatorship itself is ugly and unacceptable; second, secular dictatorship excludes Islamic parties from participating normally in the political system.
G7经济体的最后一个国家加拿大应该已经从能源和商品价格的高涨中获益，但是由于美国经济的收缩，其GDP在第一季度有所收缩。	The last of the G7 economies, Canada, should have benefited from high energy and commodity prices, but its GDP shrank in the first quarter, owing to the contracting US economy.
其目的必须是令到该区域在遭遇自然灾害时具备更加强大的适应和复原能力，并成为一个更宏大区域合作框架的一部分。	The aim must be to make the region more resilient to natural disasters as part of a broader framework for regional cooperation.
俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司想要掌握天然气管道和能源运输基础设施的欲望必须受到控制，这就要求大力促进独立生产商的发展。	Gazprom’s ambitions for gaining control of pipeline and energy transport infrastructure must be slowed, which requires allowing independent producers to prosper.
当然，大大小小的论坛上讨论过一些金融业改革的问题，渐渐形成一个共识 — — 修订流动或增量资本充足率规则。	Of course, some discussion of financial-sector reform is taking place in a variety of forums, with a gradual consensus building around sliding or incremental capital-adequacy rules.
究竟有多戏剧性现在还无从得知，但候选人在初选期间讨好党内核心支持者而在大选期间转向中立的一般假设很可能对特朗普并不适用。	Just how dramatic cannot be known, but the normal assumption that candidates play to their party’s core supporters during the primary season but then tack to the center for the general election cannot be relied on in Trump’s case.
但欧洲复兴的前景似乎非常黯淡，如果不能寻找到足以适应 21 世纪深刻转型和变革所需要的精神或架构的话，那么欧洲就将继续衰落，继续被边缘化。	The EU will continue to decline and become increasingly marginalized as it fails to find the spirit or the structure to adjust to the profound transformations and challenges of the twenty-first century.
接下来，我们开发了一个七分的系统，+3表示一个给定的大目标或小目标能强烈推动另一个 ， - 3表示实现一个目标会导致另外一个目标几乎不可能实现。	We then developed a seven-point scale, ranging from +3 when a given goal or target strongly reinforces another, to -3 when achieving one goal makes it essentially impossible to reach another.
为确定世界能否在2030年截止日期前实现这些目标，我们考量了从一切照旧到全面经济转型等4种假设情况。	To determine whether the world may be able to meet these goals by the 2030 deadline, we considered four scenarios, ranging from business as usual to total economic transformation.
类似地，烟草公司也在寻求利用TPP禁止发展中国家 — — 它们代表了最大的烟草市场 — — 采取对其产品的新的管制措施。	Likewise, tobacco companies are seeking to use the TPP to prohibit developing countries – which represent the largest cigarette markets – from adopting new controls on their products.
该委员会应该包括商界领袖和特朗普政府的内阁级别代表，如交通部长赵小兰和国家经济委员会主任加里·科恩（Gary Cohn ） 。	The Commission should include business leaders and cabinet-level representatives of the Trump administration, like Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.
毕竟，美国已经接受了塔利班不现实的保证 — — 不会利用阿富汗作为在别的地区“挑起麻烦 ” （ 即进行恐怖袭击）的基地。	After all, the US has already accepted the Taliban’s unrealistic assurances that it will not use Afghanistan as a base from which to “foment trouble” – that is, execute terrorist attacks – elsewhere.
维萨公司全球金融包容性主管史蒂芬·吉欧（Stephen Kehoe）最近指出 ， “ 过去七年对于未来七年毫无指导意义 。 ”	As Stephen Kehoe, Head of Global Financial Inclusion at Visa, recently noted, “The last seven years provide absolutely no indication of what the next seven years will be.”
完善的CSDP — — 其本身可以作为欧洲进一步一体化的基石 — — 应该成为这一体系的关键组成部分。	A fully developed CSDP – itself the cornerstone of further European integration – must be a fundamental component of such a system.
对那些想凭实力参加比赛的运动员来说，他们便面临着被不比他们更快、更强或更努力，但因服用兴奋剂而赢得体能的选手打败的可能，这对于运动员个人来说有着深刻的影响。	For athletes who want to compete clean, the threat that they may be beaten by a competitor who is not faster, stronger, or more dedicated, but who takes a drug to gain the edge, is profoundly personal.
简言之，历史罪恶不再足以迫使德国支持以色列的错误政策 — — 特别是当这些政策伤害另一个群体 — — 巴勒斯坦人时。	Simply put, historic guilt is no longer adequate to compel Germany to support Israel’s wrongheaded policies – especially when those policies are victimizing another group, the Palestinians.
如果掌握了足够的数据，我们就能搞清同一种“疾病”实际上是一系列机能失调之和，某些已知的治疗方法会对其中这样或那种疾病产生效果，还有些疾病可能根本无法治愈。	With enough data, we can then figure out that the same “disease” is in fact a variety of different disorders, some susceptible to particular known treatments and some susceptible to others or simply incurable.
这样可能很残酷，但是它可以让希腊人免于遭受国内生产总值7%的下降以及上升至22%的失业率（包括高达48％的青年失业率的增加 ） 。	That would have been painful, but it could have spared the Greeks from a 7% decline in GDP and a rise in unemployment to 22% (including an increase in youth unemployment to a whopping 48%).
这是顶尖财经记者（也有例外，比如彭博社 / 《 新闻周刊 》 （ BusinessWeek ） ， 它们在这一点上向来谨慎得多）经常使用的说法。	This is an expression used with great regularity among top finance reporters (though not, for example, by Bloomberg/BusinessWeek, which has long been much more careful on this point).
但是 — — 矛盾就在这里 — — 较低的交易成本导致巨大交易量有可能会提高金融、社会和安全风险，而这又会增加系统性波动和地区间和行业间的“风险传染 ” 。	But – and herein lies the contradiction – massive numbers of transactions can raise financial, social, and security risks, which can fuel systemic volatility and contagion across regions and sectors.
在政治上发挥领导作用的国家将为国内产业在能源技术上提供领先地位，从而确保未来的市场，而这也是一项附带的利益。	Countries that lead the way politically will, as a collateral benefit, provide domestic industries with a leading position in energy technology, ensuring future markets.
比如，按照欧盟财政经济部长理事会的规定，调整欧洲央行的运营，使之更加适合欧洲发展政策需要的必要性已经显而易见。	For example, the need to adapt the operation of the European Central Bank to a policy of development for Europe, as laid out by the Ecofin Council, is already apparent.
丝绸之路基金的第一个项目 — — 16.5亿美元规模的巴基斯坦Karot水电站 — — 包括直接项目贷款和对负责建造大坝并管理30年的公司的股权投资。	The Fund’s first initiative, the $1.65 billion Karot hydropower dam in Pakistan, will entail both direct lending to the project and equity investment in the company responsible for building the dam and managing it for 30 years.
与其由各国政府提名候选人（它们往往不愿提名来自反对派的绝佳人选 ） ， 不如由一个国际提名委员会来进行提名。	For example, rather than nominations from governments, which often are reluctant to support excellent candidates from opposition parties, an international nominating committee could put forward names.
尽管美国等国际贸易伙伴可能会反对一些地方色彩浓郁具有中国特色的制度改革，中国在制度改革方面的大胆创新与试错的最终结果将是更加稳定和更有活力的市场。	Although trading partners like the US may object to the state-led nature of this approach, the end result will be more stable and dynamic markets.
北约的欧洲盟国通过援引北约宪章中第五条的共同防御条款作出回应，并在阿富汗（如今已驻扎了三万两千的北约军队）协助美国。	The European members of NATO responded by invoking the Article 5 mutual defense clause of the NATO charter and coming to the aid of the US in Afghanistan, where today there are 32,000 NATO troops.
转型或许免不了会带来些许伤害，但毫无疑问，亚洲世纪已经出现在地平线上，世界的化学成分将发生根本性改变。	While the transformation may not always be seamless, there is no longer room to doubt that an Asian century is on the horizon, and that the world’s chemistry will change fundamentally.
苏黎世—经历上一场房地产市场崩盘还不到十年，爱尔兰最近发生了价格大幅复苏的情况，都柏林房价较2010年上涨了50%左右。	ZURICH – After having endured the collapse of its housing market less than a decade ago, Ireland has lately been experiencing a blistering recovery in prices, which already have risen in Dublin by some 50% from the trough in 2010.
如果事实证明阿根廷比索表现比实际汇率更强（实际情况很可能是这样 ） ， 那么投资者获得的收益就会十分丰厚。	If the Argentine peso turns out to be stronger than that in real terms, which it probably will, investors stand to profit handsomely.
所有国家都有权利发展出于民用目的的核计划 — — 我们沙特阿拉伯也有 — — 但伊朗追求的是核武器，这只能给国家带来难堪。	While all countries have the right to develop a civilian nuclear program – we Saudis have our own – Iran’s attempt to pursue nuclear weapons has brought nothing but hardship to the country.
类似地，发展中世界的国家领导人 — — 大约三十亿发展中国家人民无法获得平价能源 — — 饱受着改善人民生活水平的巨大压力。	Similarly, national leaders in the developing world – where some three billion people do not have access to affordable energy – are under immense pressure to deliver standard-of-living improvements.
这意味着重新整合项目以及其他经济项目将成为胡萝卜，一方面鼓励谈判，另一方面也可用来维持长期和平与稳定。	This would entail using reintegration and other economic programs as a carrot to support the negotiations, and would also support peace and stability in the long run.
NDB绝对应该采取措施支持新结核病治疗和免疫研究，特别是针对抗药性菌株的研究，因为结核病在金砖国家非常普遍。	It seems only reasonable that the NDB should announce steps to support pharmaceutical research into new TB treatments and vaccines, particularly for drug-resistant strains, given that TB is especially prevalent in the BRICS.
换句话说，债券市场认为长期增长和通胀前景与2015年至去年初大致相同 — — 并且比十年前要弱得多。	In other words, the bond market believes that the long-term outlook for growth and inflation is more or less the same as it was in the period from 2015 until early last year – and much weaker than it was a decade ago.
如果战前死亡率太低和/或估计人口数太高¾比如，举个例子，他们忽略了伊拉克难民的外逃¾那么由此得出的伊拉克“死亡增量”数据就会被夸大。	If the pre-war mortality rate was too low and/or if the population estimates were too high – because, for example, they ignored outflows of refugees from Iraq – the resulting estimates of the number of Iraqi “excess deaths” would be inflated.
发自纽约 — — 印度精神领袖甘地曾说过一句名言 ： “ 地球上的一切足以满足每个人的需要，却不足以填满每个人的欲望 。 ”	NEW YORK – India’s great moral leader Mohandas Gandhi famously said that there is enough on Earth for everybody’s need, but not enough for everybody’s greed.
因此西方国家政府的最佳选择就是实施渐进性变革，用一系列适应性手段作推动，并随着时间推移最终惠及大多数人。	The best option for Western governments is thus to pursue gradual change, propelled by a variety of adaptive instruments, which would reach a critical mass over time.
财政部等政府部门、独立的英格兰银行和我们著名大学的完整性部分因为绝大多数议员赞成留欧而遭到围攻、同样遭到围攻的还有议会本身。	The integrity of government departments like the Treasury, the independent Bank of England, and our great universities came under attack, as did Parliament itself, partly because the overwhelming majority of MPs favored remaining in the EU.
由于担心阿拉伯起义会刺激本国被压迫的少数民族，他们拒绝接受通过联合国安理会促进阿拉伯世界的革命性变革。	Concerned that the Arab rebellions would radicalize their own repressed minorities, they refuse to allow the UN Security Council to be used to promote revolutionary changes in the Arab world.
美国剑桥—阅读托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）风靡一时的新书《二十一世纪资本论 》 （ Capital in the Twenty-First Century）会让你有这样一种感觉：自从强盗贵族和国王时代以来，世界从未如此不平等。	CAMBRIDGE – Reading Thomas Piketty’s influential new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, one might conclude that the world has not been this unequal since the days of robber barons and kings.
事实上，过去熊市之前的高点月份也往往展现出较高的实际收益增长：所有13次熊市平均下来是每年13.3 ％ 。	In fact, peak months before past bear markets also tended to show high real earnings growth: 13.3% per year, on average, for all 13 episodes.
而欧洲二战后的历史也明白地告诉我们，传统结盟制和综合性多边框架可以是互为补充的，也是维持区域和平稳定的必要条件。	As Europe’s post-1945 history clearly shows, traditional alliances and a comprehensive multilateral framework can be complementary, and are essential to maintaining regional peace and stability.
台湾民进党的热忱常常接近于原教旨主义。 陈水扁在他的党内的声望把他从一个有着强烈民主天性的人变成了一个视权力和特权为其一己利益的人的范例。	Chen’s popularity among his party followers, whose fervency often bordered on fundamentalism, changed him from a person with deep democratic instincts into a textbook case of a man who regards power and its prerogatives as being his by right.
但捐助资金同时也与话语权有关。 金砖五国 — — 不出意外 — — 也不断施压要求对世界货币基金组织的投票体制进行改革，并逐步与那些经济受灾国进行货币互换。	But contributing money also means having a say, and the BRICS – no surprise – are pressing their demand for voting reform in the IMF, and are increasingly offering currency swaps to economically troubled countries.
支持为自己珍视的普世价值观符合国际社会、尤其是西方国家的利益，这套价值观现在正在为欧洲邻国成百上千万民众所接受。	It is in the interest of the international community, especially the West, to support the universal values that it holds dear – the same values that are now being embraced by millions of Europe’s neighbors.
他们为病人提供的医疗服务减少了，因为要花更多的时间埋头于笔记本电脑输入数据，但这一切，至少目前来说，却并未提升他们的工作效率。	They are delivering less patient care as they spend more time hunched over their laptops, inputting data that add nothing, currently, to their productivity.
这一安排可以让财政不堪重负的国家维持承诺，如果它们采取一致行动，可以重新回到A欧元集团 — — 比它们使用自己的货币要容易得多。	This arrangement would hold out the promise to fiscally stressed economies that, if they get their act together, they could rejoin euro-A – and do so more readily than they could from their own currency.
毕竟大多数经济学家之所以未能预见危机的来临，就是因为他们已经与真实世界中人们的想法和行动完全脱节了。	After all, most economists did not see this crisis coming in part because they had removed themselves from what real-world people were doing and thinking.
巴罗佐称此协议为“具有历史意义的 ” ， 布莱尔则赞美它是“开创性的、雄心勃勃的目标 ” ， 德国总理默克尔甚至敢说这些承诺“能够避免人类灾难的发生 。 ”	Barroso calls the agreement “historic,” Tony Blair extols its “groundbreaking, bold, ambitious targets,” and German Chancellor Angela Merkel even ventured that the promises “can avoid what could well be a human calamity.”
但旧体系已不再能够提供有用的答案，俄罗斯通过无视联合国安理会（基于国家的国际制度的最高形式）关于乌克兰问题的决议以及在安理会叙利亚决议上从中作梗证明了这一点。	Yet the old systems no longer offer useful answers, as Russia has demonstrated by brushing aside the United Nations Security Council – the high altar of the state-based international system – over Ukraine and stalemating it over Syria.
但20世纪70年代石油价格暴涨、沙特财富暴增所导致的影响力扩大刺激了在该国占主要地位的严肃瓦哈比教派的传播。	But the rising influence of Saudi Arabia after the 1970s, when skyrocketing oil prices boosted the country’s wealth considerably, helped to spur the spread of the Kingdom’s dominant and austere Wahhabi sect.
虽然万维网的构想起源于1989年，网站数量突飞猛进、互联网科技开始改变全球供应链还仅仅是近15年的事。	While the World Wide Web was conceived in 1989, it was only in the last 15 years that the number of Web sites burgeoned, and Internet technology began to transform global supply chains.
美国也主宰了几个布雷顿森林机构 — — 国际货币基金、世界银行以及后来的世界贸易组织，它为全球贸易和金融秩序定规，美元成为主要储备货币。	The US also dominated the Bretton Woods institutions – the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and, later, the World Trade Organization – to determine the global trade and financial rules, with the dollar as the main reserve currency.
没有理由去认为固德拉克·乔纳森（Goodluck Jonathan）会抢先辞职，并且，在他担任总统后解除其总统职位极有可能激起三角洲地区空前的暴力活动。	There is no reason to believe that Goodluck Jonathan will preemptively resign, and removing him from office if he assumes the presidency might well stoke unprecedented violence in the Delta.
特别是当我们手头有可以利用资源 — — 辉瑞制药的专利，深圳的工厂，遍布全球的物流网络，或是在亚特兰大的购物中心等 — — 的时候，我们更愿意这么做。 其实，它并不在“手头 ” 。	It is also true that when we invest our wealth – in Pfizer’s intellectual property, factories in Shenzhen, worldwide distribution networks, or shopping malls in Atlanta – it is not , in fact, at hand.
罗斯熟稔地归纳了这一过程的悲剧和喜剧要素，我们也谈到了在特朗普的庸俗和暴力统治的黑暗中可能崛起哪些力量。	Roth skillfully distilled the tragic and the comic elements of this process, and we spoke of the forces that might be able to stand up to the dark tide of vulgarity and violence under Trump.
它虽然有来自石油的收入，但用美元来为经济输血，就其本身而言，对繁荣的促进程度可能并没有我们想象的那么大。	Although it had oil revenue, the flow of dollars into an economy, by itself, does not boost prosperity as much as one might think.
只有欧洲在国际舞台上展现出意志和实力，它才能转变其发展模式，而这或许也是中美“二国集团”所乐意看到的。	Europe could change the course of this development only if it presented itself as a serious player and stood up for its interests on the global stage. The “G-2” of China and the US would probably be happy about that.
如果乌克兰在其欧洲道路上取得成功，如果它能使其起作用，它就可以解决使俄罗斯文化痛苦了几个世纪的问题 — — 俄罗斯还是西方？	If Ukraine succeeds in its European choice, if it is able to make it work, it can settle the question that has bedeviled Russian culture for centuries – Russia or the West?
不仅如此，美元贬值还可能带来金融恐慌：美元计价的长期利率大幅提高会使持有大量短期负债和长期资产的大型金融机构陷入困境。	Moreover, there may be a financial panic: large financial institutions with short-term liabilities and long-term assets will have a difficult time weathering a large rise in long-term dollar-denominated interest rates.
Big Lift由一个县领导人组成的广泛联盟发起，资金来源包括县消费税、联邦拨款和慈善机构，目前已筹资2,800万美元，超过200个参与。	Initiated by a broad coalition of county leaders and funded by a combination of county sales tax, federal grants, and philanthropy, the Big Lift has raised $28 million and gotten more than 200 organizations involved.
作为摆脱困境的途径之一 ， “ 森利斯委员会 ” （ Senlis Council）正提议为研究针对阿富汗的鸦片许可体系而进行科学试点项目。 这可能会成为经济重建进程中的一个核心组成部分。	As a way to address this dilemma, the Senlis Council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for Afghanistan, which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process.
此外，在提前退休政策下欧盟约有3000万65岁以下的养老金领取者，也就是说大约25％的欧洲退休人员根本不算老。	Moreover, as a result of early-retirement policies, around 30 million pensioners across the EU are under 65 years old, which is to say that about 25% of all European retirees are not old at all.
如果你是一位每小时收入7.25美元联邦最低工资的劳动者，那么你只能在美国3007个县中的12个中租得起一个单间。	Of 3,007 counties in the US, a worker earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour can afford a one-bedroom rental in only 12.
伯克利 — — 在我往来联系的圈子里，存在着一种近乎普遍的共识：美国货币当局犯下了三个促成并加剧本次金融危机的严重错误。	BERKELEY – In the circles in which I travel, there is near-universal consensus that America’s monetary authorities made three serious mistakes that contributed to and exacerbated the financial crisis.
但中国的自信态度已经促成了接受由美国主导的亚洲多边体系的强烈意愿，亚洲国家宁愿接受由美国主导的多边体系，也不愿接受中国谋求领导的排他性制度。	But China’s assertiveness has provided enormous incentives to embrace an Asian multilateral system backed by America, rather than accept the exclusionary system that China seeks to lead.
同样，在爱尔兰，如果他们的候选名单中任一性别比例无法达到30 ％ ， 政党将失去50%的国家选举补助。	Similarly, in Ireland, political parties lose 50% of their state funding if their candidate pool includes less than 30% of either gender.
克劳迪奥·博里奥（Claudio Borio）在多年前指出，全球金融周期与实体经济周期相比变得越来越长，并且与主要储备货币美元的价值波动密切相关。	As Claudio Borio pointed out years ago, the global financial cycle is longer and larger than real economic cycles, and is closely associated with the fluctuating value of the dominant reserve currency, the US dollar.
在金融危机不断积蓄的过程中，德国各大银行拙劣的盈余储蓄投资手段推高了资产价格泡沫，又在随后引发了债务萎缩。	Its banks’ poor approach to lending their surplus savings inflated asset-price bubbles in the run-up to the financial crisis, and have imposed debt deflation since then.
但这样的论点立即激起了一片反对之声，因为贸易协定的任何停滞或逆转都将损害世界上最贫穷的人群，因为这些人失去了利用出口导向型增长来摆脱贫困的希望。	But such arguments immediately run up against the objection that any standstill or reversal on trade agreements would harm the world’s poorest, by diminishing their prospect of escaping poverty through export-led growth.
国际援助组织应该在州和联邦政府的帮助下，不但要解决贫困的近因，也要制定长期战略帮助农业社会安然度过坏收成。	International aid organizations, working with state and federal governments, should go beyond addressing the immediate causes of poverty to also develop long-term strategies for helping agricultural communities survive bad harvests.
柏林—欧盟可能从未遇到过这样的经验：乌克兰总统亚努科维奇的政府装作与欧盟谈判加入协定，直到最后一刻突然反悔。	BERLIN – The European Union has probably never experienced anything like it before: Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s government pretended to negotiate an association agreement, only to back out at the last minute.
有些，比方说希腊债务闹剧，属于经济灾难；其他，比方说叙利亚的国内崩溃，则属于暴力和政治混乱的范畴；还有些，尤其是乌克兰困境，介乎于两者之间。	Some, such as Greece’s debt drama, are economic disasters; others, like Syria’s implosion, are characterized by brutality and political chaos; and still others, most notably Ukraine’s predicament, fall somewhere in between.
为满足基本能源需求而在欧盟全境建设高压输电线路和蓄电设施至关重要，此外还需要建设分散的配电网络及大规模投资节能项目。	High-voltage transmission lines across the EU and storage facilities to overcome the problem of meeting basic energy demands will be crucial, as will decentralized distribution grids and higher investment in energy conservation.
必须牢记，今天所存在的怪异安排是为了克服金融业对成立中央银行的反对、通过1913年联邦储备法案而设计的。	It is important to recall that the peculiar arrangements prevailing today were designed to overcome the financial sector’s opposition to the establishment of a central bank when the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913.
投资者需要获得保证，债务付息成本处于可控状态、债务规模和赤字上限被严密监控以使违约风险最小化并使银行能够成为可持续增长的扎实根基。	Investors need to be reassured that debt-service costs are under control, and that debt volumes and deficit limits are firmly monitored in order to minimize default risks and strengthen banks’ ability to lay the groundwork for sustainable growth.
中国5月发布的军事战略白皮书鼓吹扩大国家防御边界计划，并因此加剧了邻国的担忧，很可能导致进一步扩大军费。	The white paper on military strategy that China released in May, which touted plans to expand the country’s defense perimeter, intensified neighbors’ concerns, making even more military spending likely.
该书的总印数超过了100万册，被看作美国精神病学的圣经；当然它的章节和片断还在学校、监狱、法庭以及被世界各地的精神健康专业人士引用。	With over a million copies in print, the manual is known as the bible of American psychiatry; certainly it is an invoked chapter and verse in schools, prisons, courts, and by mental-health professionals around the world.
即使普京的“挑衅”论破产，化学袭击也有可能是叙利亚军队中的流氓分子发动的，而巴沙尔为了保住总统宝座，必须否认他们的过失。	Even if Putin’s “provocation” thesis is dismissed, it is possible that the chemical attacks were unleashed by rogue elements in the Syrian army, whose culpability Assad had to deny to preserve his own position.
AFC领导的一个财团正为撒哈拉以南的非洲第一个深水集装箱港融资。 该港位于尼日利亚的Olokola，地处大西洋海岸线上。	An AFC-led consortium is financing a project that will develop Sub-Saharan Africa’s first deep-sea container port on the Atlantic coastline area of Olokola, Nigeria.
国内市场是当今中国的力量源泉，这意味着它近期内在这一领域做出的决策将在很大程度上决定其未来几十年的全球地位。	China’s domestic market is now the source of its power, which means that the choices it makes in this area in the near term will largely determine its global standing for decades to come.
预计今年将有约800,000名难民进入到德国境内，而英国首相戴维·卡梅伦却为不到 30,000份庇护申请大惊小怪，不怀好意地警告穿越北海的“大批人群 ” 。	Some 800,000 refugees are expected to enter Germany this year, whereas British Prime Minister David Cameron is making a fuss about fewer than 30,000 asylum applications and warning darkly about “swarms of people” crossing the North Sea.
如果被联邦调查局称之为“潜在破坏性装置”的这14枚自制炸弹发挥了预期的效果，那么炸弹制造者可能已经杀害或重伤了作为特朗普对手的名人。	Had the 14 crude bombs, which the FBI called “potentially destructive devices,” worked as intended, the bombmaker could have killed or gravely injured a who’s who of Trump adversaries.
从某种程度上说，这一点仍然成立，但一些关键之处已经发生了变化：足球和其他种类的营生一样，已经走向了全球化。	This is still true to some extent, but something crucial has changed: football, like other types of commerce, has gone global.
亚米恩没有释放这九个刑期被取消的人，而是宣布进入紧急状态，拘禁了五名最高法院法官中的两名，其中包括首席法官。	Instead of freeing those whose sentences were nullified, Yameen declared a state of emergency and jailed two of the Supreme Court’s five judges, including the chief justice.
把预算削减计划公布的时间就定在7国集团会议之后有助于伦敦会议能和谐一致地举行。 通过此会议，美国和欧洲可以一致宣称美国正在着手解决它的“双赤字 ” — —财政赤字和经常项目赤字。	Timing the budget’s release for just after the G-7 made for a harmonious London meeting in which both Americans and Europeans could claim that the US was taking care of business—that is, its twin fiscal and current-account deficits.
事实上，最近在英国召开的有关ECT的方针会议上，没有来自精神病治疗方面的代表，但是有许多来自病人团体的代表。	In fact, at recent guideline meetings in the United Kingdom on the issue of ECT, there have been no representatives from psychiatry, but many from patient groups.
他们被这样告知。 因此，他们加倍努力以发觉未来雇主可能欣赏的“激情 ” 、 摆放权要人物告诉他们的、存在于体内某个地方的虚幻的“真实”自我。	So they redouble their efforts to discover “passions” that future employers may appreciate, and to locate that mythical “true” self that people in positions of power tell them is somewhere inside them.
对于埃及的现任领导层来说，利比亚的卡扎菲和叙利亚的巴沙尔·阿萨德所采用的残暴策略在埃及的环境中起作用的可能性比上述两国都要大。	For Egypt’s current leadership, the brutal tactics employed by the likes of Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad are more likely to work in the Egyptian context than in those countries.
虽然这些批评不无道理，但过去20年来工厂养殖¾不仅包括肉鸡，还包括肉猪、肉用小牛和室外牧场饲养的肉牛¾在发展中国家，特别是亚洲国家得到迅速的推广。	Yet, despite these well-founded criticisms, over the last 20 years factory farming – not only of chickens, but also of pigs, veal calves, dairy cows, and, in outdoor feedlots, cattle – has spread rapidly in developing countries, especially in Asia.
能够看清楚的是 — — 至少从现在看 — — 我们不能指望美国充当变化中的基于规则的全球体系的主要发起者和设计者，从而公平地管理相互依存性。	What does seem clear, at least for now, is that the US cannot be counted on to serve as a principal sponsor and architect of the evolving rules-based global system for fairly managing interdependence.
在2011年完全暴露欧洲军力有限性的北约利比亚行动后，时任美国国防部长罗伯特·盖茨对布鲁塞尔进行了访问。	In 2011, after NATO’s operation in Libya, which fully revealed the limits of Europe’s military capacity, then-US Defense Secretary Robert Gates visited Brussels.
民族优越感必然会扭曲一个民族与世界其他部分的关系，以色列的实力迷信来自犹太人历史的深层经验，特别是非犹太世界永恒的、冷血的敌意。	Ethnocentrism is bound to distort a people’s relations with the rest of the world, and Israel’s doctrine of power was drawn from the depths of Jewish experience, particularly the eternal, unforgiving hostility of a Gentile world.
最新选举的第二个熟悉的特征是高投票率 — — 约为73 % ， 这已经成为有广受欢迎的改革派候选人参与的选举的一个标志。	The second familiar feature of the latest election was high voter turnout – about 73% – which has been a hallmark of elections involving popular reform-minded candidates.
事实上，当以色列民众提前原计划超过两年于三月再次投票表决时，内塔尼亚胡可能的落选不仅对以色列意义重大，而且影响着整个中东地区。	Indeed, when Israelis vote again in March, more than two years ahead of schedule, Netanyahu could be voted out of office, with important implications not only for Israel, but also for the wider Middle East.
发自斯坦福 — — 在过去一年中全球经济增长一直乏力 — — 而对2016年的预测也仅仅是稍好一点。	STANFORD – Over the last year, global growth has been anemic – and the forecast is only slightly better for 2016.
国际清算银行和巴塞尔委员会与国际货币基金组织相比处在更为有利的地位，但是要对它们进行根本性的改革以扩大它们的成员范围并避免巴塞尔委员会的主要问题：它缺乏对发展中国家的代表性。	The Bank for International Settlements and the Basel Committee are better placed, but a fundamental reform is needed to broaden their membership and to avoid a major problem of the Basel Committee: its lack of representation of developing countries.
但是，由于美国在其所干预的地区受到了诸多挫折，而国内则正在饱受经济低迷之苦，因此在如何应对国际局势变化上，美国需要面临诸多不确定性。	But, in the aftermath of setbacks in regions where it intervened, and with heightened economic distress at home, the US finds itself uncertain about how to respond to changing global events.
去中心化的组织、多极的领导层以及相互冲突的意识形态立场使得沙拉菲总是处于一盘散沙的状态，组织结构很不稳定，很容易受到操纵和渗透。	Decentralized organization, multiple leaderships, and conflicting ideological stances make the Salafi trend amorphous, volatile, and susceptible to manipulation and infiltration.
然而，尽管发生了巨大的变化，当今天的国外评论员想要在评论中国的作品中引用文学典故时，奥维尔的作品仍然是首选。	Still, despite all the changes, when foreign commentators nowadays want to spice up a China piece with a literary allusion, Orwell remains the seasoning of choice.
但大多数人收入停滞或下降为这一争论平添一个不同角度 — — 也要求强调让收入分布中的大多数工资增长的不同类型的解决办法。	But stagnating or falling incomes for the many add a different dimension to the debate – and demand different types of solutions that emphasize wage growth for the majority of the income distribution.
密歇根大学经济学家贾斯丁·沃尔夫斯（Justin Wlofers）在其《纽约时报》博客上为这一共识喝彩。	The University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers cheered the consensus in his New York Times blog.
这与美国士兵在伊拉克阿布格莱德监狱发生的虐囚行为如出一辙，表明社会学研究描述社会环境主宰了个体性格的说法很大程度上是正确的。	It goes on to establish direct parallels with the abuses committed by American soldiers at Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison, presenting much of the social science research illustrating the power of social situations to dominate individual dispositions.
此外，通过让所有人（不管他们的收入如何）都能获得平价的高品质医疗，政府呢能够在实现全民健康覆盖方面取得重大进展。	Moreover, by making affordable, quality health care available to everyone, regardless of their income, governments can take an important step toward universal health-care coverage (UHC).
不管采取什么措施，政府都是在竭尽全力干扰政治、社会和环境活动家的工作，其程度之深为四分之一世纪前欧洲共产主义倒台以来所未见。	Whatever the means, governments are striving to interfere with the work of political, social, and environmental activists to an extent not seen since before communism collapsed in Europe a quarter-century ago.
至于国有银行，也许可以利用它们的规模经济等优势为数以百万计的渴望影响和丰富新经济的中小企业提供多层次金融服务。	State-owned banks, for their part, might be able to provide multi-tiered financing for the millions of small and medium-size enterprises that are eager to shape and enrich the new economy.
因此，我们的挑战是增加汽车带来的好处，降低（并最终消除）汽车带来的伤害，从而让未来乘车旅行变得清洁、高效、安全且人人可行。	Our challenge, therefore, is to boost the benefits and reduce (and eventually eliminate) the harm done by our cars, so that the future of motor travel is clean, efficient, safe, and accessible to all.
一场悬而未决的金融危机，一场难民危机，日益恶化的安全环境，以及停滞不前的一体化进程令整个欧洲陷入了一种有害且极不稳定的政治环境中，而民粹主义和民族主义则在其上肆意滋长。	An unresolved financial crisis, a refugee crisis, a deteriorating security environment, and a stalled integration process have created throughout Europe a toxic, unstable political environment in which populism and nationalism thrive.
我说的不是欧洲债务危机，要解决它还得靠更多的合作和责任共担，不管是在欧元区各成员国内部还是债权国和债务国之间。	No, I am not talking here about Europe’s debt crisis, decisive resolution of which still requires greater cooperation and shared responsibility, both within individual eurozone member states and between creditor and debtor countries.
事实上，金砖国家已成为中国外交的力量放大器，只要中国在推进其国家利益的过程中不过于强硬，就能继续利用这一放大器。	Indeed, the BRICS has already proved to be a force multiplier for Chinese diplomacy, and can remain so if China is careful not to push its national interests too hard.
这场胜利，与居尔的当选一起确认了AKP作为一个再结盟政党的出现，同时也证明了尽管恐外民族主义在抬头，但土耳其人仍然想加入欧盟。	That victory, combined with Gül’s election, confirm the AKP’s emergence as a party of realignment, and that, despite an upsurge of xenophobic nationalism, Turks wanted to integrate with the European Union.
印度肯定警惕伊朗发展核武器的可能性，更不用说它对伊朗伊斯兰原教旨主义可能对克什米尔穆斯林造成的影响表示关注。	India is certainly alarmed at the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons, not to mention its concern at the possible effects of Iran’s Islamist fundamentalism on Kashmiri Muslims.
私营经济被彻底重建，并充满活力，但如果财政需求不降低，它也不能保持竞争力—这是整个欧洲的老大难问题。	The private sector has been entirely rebuilt and is vibrant, but it cannot remain competitive if fiscal demands are not reduced – a familiar problem in Europe as a whole.
但是，目前所有这些都没有发生，这大部分是因为尼古丁被认为是一种高致瘾性有毒物质，因此，即使是烟民，在尝试NRT或PNV时也会犹豫不决。	But, so far, none of this has occurred, largely because nicotine is viewed as a highly addictive and toxic substance, with even smokers hesitating to try NRT or PNV for this reason.
作为交换，希腊肯定希望获得债务豁免，意大利想要欧盟财政规则放松以及包括购买债券在内的欧洲央行职能转变；而保加利亚想要走加入欧元区的快车道。	In exchange, Greece no doubt wants debt relief; Italy wants looser EU fiscal rules and a change to the European Central Bank’s mandate to include bond purchases; and Bulgaria wants a fast track to eurozone accession.
遗憾的是，美国总统奥巴马及其政府仍未能理解这给美国在其欧洲盟友中间的信誉所造成的伤害的广度和严重度。	Regrettably, US President Barack Obama and his administration have yet to comprehend the scale and severity of the damage caused to America’s credibility among its European allies.
它不应该继续追求失衡的财政一体化，而必须致力于实施政治联盟的关键要素，包括一体化警察部队、共同避难法、单一外交政策，最重要的则是统一的军队。	Instead of continuing to push for unbalanced fiscal integration, it must work to implement key elements of political union, including an integrated police force, common asylum laws, a single foreign policy, and, above all, a united army.
2004年后的24个月里，FOMC以每次25个基点的节奏通过17次操作将联邦基金利率从1%提高到5.25 % 。	In the 24 months from June 2004, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate from 1% to 5.25% in 17 increments of 25 basis points each.
金融稳定论坛不是恐怖生物，而个体国家和国际监管者也有很大的自主空间，所造成的不愉快后果现在早已众所周知了。	The FSF was not a scary creature, and the individual regulators, national and international, were largely left to their own devices, with all of the unhappy consequences with which we have become acquainted.
所以，合作的主要领域一直集中在工具和技术的开发上，这些工具和技术用于确立目标，寻找生物标记物以确认药品的药效和毒性。	So it is not surprising that the main areas of collaboration have been in the development of tools and technologies for target validation and the discovery and validation of biomarkers for efficacy and toxicity.
由我牵头的联合国专家网络 — — 可持续发展方案网络（Sustainable Development Solutions Network）将在7月发布重要报告，指出各主要经济体应如何实现能源体系的去碳化。	The UN expert network that I direct, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UN SDSN), will issue a major report in July on how each of the major economies can successfully decarbonize the energy system.
截至2015年末，余额宝基金经理管理着1,650亿美元资产，并将支付宝数百万缺乏财务知识的小额储户转化为得到可观回报的投资者。	By the end of 2015, the Yu’e Bao fund manager was overseeing $165 billion in assets and had converted Alipay’s millions of small, financially unsophisticated savers into investors collecting respectable returns.
像英国退欧一样，不可思议的事情已经发生：唐纳德·特朗普现在是当选美国总统，表明本土主义已经对国际主义大获全胜。	And just like Brexit, the unthinkable has happened: Donald Trump is now President-elect of the US, signaling the triumph of nativism over internationalism.
但全面的贸易自由化会对那些最不发达的国家产生复杂的影响，其中一些国家可能会失去现在享有的通往发达经济体市场的优惠渠道，只有对此进行补偿才能让它们受益。	But full trade liberalization would have a complex impact on the least developed economies, some of which would benefit only if compensated for the loss of the preferential access to advanced-economy markets that they currently enjoy.
有时政府需要采取更具前瞻性的策略 — — 如税收激励、投资特区或有竞争力的货币 — — 已提高这类投资的盈利能力。	At other times, governments need more proactive strategies – such as tax incentives, special investment zones, or hyper-competitive currencies – to raise the profitability of such investments.
西门子英国公司首席执行官尤尔根·迈尔（Jürgen Maier）最近敦促英国领导人明确将如何与欧盟展开贸易，要求他们确保英国留在关税联盟中。	The CEO of Siemens UK, Jürgen Maier, recently urged British leaders to clarify how trade with the EU will work, urging them to ensure that the country remains in the customs union.
事实上，就在对白沙瓦袭击表面的愤慨背后，本案最大的嫌疑人 — — 联合国指定的恐怖分子、曾担任LeT最高行动首领的扎基 - 乌尔 - 拉赫曼·拉赫维被允许取保候审。	Indeed, under the cover of indignation over the Peshawar attack, the leading suspect in the case – UN-designated terrorist Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, who served as LeT’s operations chief – secured bail.
考虑到中国经济的快速增长和人民币的日渐强势，中国的GDP（以国际外汇市场美元汇率计算）将可能比原先预期更早地超越美国（大概会在10-15年内 ） 。	In light of China’s rapid economic growth and the renminbi’s growing strength, Chinese GDP (based on the market dollar rate) will likely exceed that of the US much earlier than expected, possibly in 10-15 years.
是时候让决策者认识到创新国际政策合作并非奢侈品；有时 — — 比方说今天 — — 就必须执行这样的合作。	It is time for policymakers to recognize that innovative international policy cooperation is not a luxury; sometimes – like today – it is a necessity.
第二，欧洲和美国看待彼此的方式之间存在一种持续的结构失衡：欧洲带着热情关注美国，而美国对欧洲兴趣一般，而且越来越不关心。	Second, there is a continuing structural imbalance between the way Europe looks at America, i.e., with passion and concern, and the way America looks at Europe, i.e., with mild interest giving way to growing indifference.
货运无人机特别适合所谓的地方代理人实现模式（local-agent delivery model ） 。	Cargo drones are particularly well suited to the so-called local-agent delivery model.
伦敦—在上个月的欧洲议会选举中，欧洲怀疑派和极端主义政党赢得 25%的群众选票，其中最大的胜利来自法国、英国和希腊。	LONDON – In last month’s European Parliament election, euroskeptic and extremist parties won 25% of the popular vote, with the biggest gains chalked up in France, the United Kingdom, and Greece.
华尔街预言家不应该拒绝接受货币理论和历史，而应该让目光超越美联储新闻稿，扪心自问：否定几百年的经验有意义吗？	Instead of rejecting monetary theory and history, the army of Wall Street soothsayers should look beyond the Fed’s press releases and ask themselves: Does it make sense to throw out centuries of experience?
他们认为金融部门是中性的，而不是基础性的 — — 正如约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter）所说的那样是资本主义的“监察官 ” 。	They regard the financial sector as neutral, not as fundamental (capitalism’s “ephor,” as Joseph Schumpeter put it).
这是美国财政部长小摩根索（Henry Morgenthau Jr . ） 在两年前，也就是1944年9月所提出、并由美国和英国联合签署的摩根索计划（Morgenthau Plan）明确表达的意愿。	That was the express intention of the Morgenthau Plan, devised by US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. and co-signed by the United States and Britain two years earlier, in September 1944.
这就带来了问题：到底是什么在阻挠经济学家和决策者设计 — — 或者说寻找 — — 大一统的经济学理论？	This raises the question: What is really preventing economists and policymakers from devising – or even seeking – a unified theory of economics?
对此哈特维尔研究小组明智地指出，为了实现目标，我们使用的气候政策必须可以带来明显的好处 （ “ 迅速而且可见的回报 ” ） ，对各阶层的人们都具有吸引力，而且产生具体可测的结果。	The Hartwell group correctly notes that in order to be successful, our approach to climate policy should offer obvious advantages (“rapid and demonstrable pay-back”), appeal to a wide variety of people, and produce measurable results.
其他国家应该希望这只是国际税收合作的暂时停止而非终结。 国际税收合作始于13年前墨西哥蒙特雷首届国际发展融资会议。	The rest of the world should hope this will prove to be a pause rather than an end to progress on international tax cooperation, which began 13 years ago, at the first International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico.
更何况新加坡几乎就在赤道上（在《摘金奇缘》其中一段让人感觉不可思议的片段中，有人开着敞篷吉普车到机场接尼克和瑞秋 ） 。	Yet Singapore is situated virtually on top of it. (In one implausible scene in “Crazy Rich Asians,” Nick and Rachel are picked up at the airport in an open-air jeep.)
这一指导原则只是将已有的欧盟政策正式化，但它还是立刻引来了批评，内塔尼亚胡说这“破坏了和平 ” ， 并在谈判中让“让巴勒斯坦更加被动 ” 。	While the guidelines simply formalized existing EU policy, they drew immediate criticism, with Netanyahu declaring that they “undermined peace” and “hardened Palestinian positions” during negotiations.
正如联合国的一份调查报告《不平等困境》中所示，不论贫富，几乎没有国家能够避免全球化大趋势和日益严重的不平等，或由这两者带来的教育、健康和社会福利方面的影响。	As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality, or to its consequences for education, health, and social welfare.
在孟加拉国，中央银行支持经济发展的措施包括为满足可再生能源、能源效率或废物管理目标的工程的银行贷款提供再融资。	In Bangladesh, the central bank’s efforts to support economic development include low-cost refinancing for banks lending to projects that meet goals for renewables, energy efficiency, or waste management.
因此，现有工作模式的破坏应该受到欢迎和“缓解 ” ， 如通过让教育和社会保障体系适应自动化驱动的就业市场的需要。	Thus, disruptions to existing work patterns should be welcomed and “mitigated,” by adapting education and social-security systems to the needs of an automation-driven job market.
不仅如此，单就对抗恐怖主义而言，民主制度无论从政治还是实际操作角度都更为有效，尤其在情报搜集领域更是如此。	When it comes to fighting terrorism, moreover, democracies are more effective both politically and operationally, particularly in terms of their intelligence services.
在东非共同体成员国看来，这个问题关乎去殖民化，即南苏丹民众几百年来被阿拉伯人奴役、羞辱、及遭受非人的待遇。	To EAC members, this is a matter of de-colonization, for southern Sudan’s people have been enslaved, dehumanized, and humiliated for centuries by the Arabs.
安倍经济学 — — 安倍晋三自六年前上台就任首相后发起的一系列改革 — — 原本承诺将通胀率提高到2 ％ 。	Abenomics, the cluster of reforms initiated by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe when he came to power six years ago, promised to get inflation up to 2%.
与其数字时代的继任者Instagram和Facebook相比，柯达（Kodak）等公司所需的基础设施建设规模要巨大得多 ， （ 当然）也雇用了多得多的员工。	A company like Kodak needed and built vastly more infrastructure than its digital successors Instagram and Facebook – and (of course) employed many more workers.
我们需要听到这样一次演说，它将详述五项任务。 为了弥补前一任政府对自由造成的损失，奥巴马必须象他处理最先两条行政命令那样来迅速执行这五项任务。	There is a speech that we still need to hear, detailing five tasks that, in order to repair the damage to liberty caused by the previous administration, he must pursue as quickly as he handled the first two executive orders.
德国政治家应该不会忘了另一位克里姆林宫统治者 — — 列宁 — — 的话 ： “ 那些资本家们如今出售给我们的绳子 ， ” 他说 ， “ 就是我们将来把他们吊死的那些 ” 。	German politicians would do well to recall the words of another Kremlin ruler: “These capitalists,” Lenin reputedly said, “will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.”
如果美国成功地施展其军事力量，将会缔造出一个崭新、民主的中东；可如果军事霸权遭受失败，带来的必将是地区的动荡和权力的真空。	Were the US to succeed in using its military strength, it would create a new, democratic Middle East. But were it, despite its military might, to fail, it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.
在应对全球金融、经济危机的节骨眼儿上，德国这个全欧盟最大的经济体并没有表现出举足轻重的领导力，反而不断缩回到自家的螺丝壳里。	Instead of providing resolute leadership in the global financial and economic crisis, the European Union’s largest economy is withdrawing into its shell.
净结果几乎肯定可以加速全球增长，因为如此巨大的收入再分配的受益者大多是中低收入家庭，他们会把所有的收益都花掉。	The net result will almost certainly accelerate global growth, because the beneficiaries of this enormous income redistribution are mostly lower- and middle-income households that spend all they earn.
如果合理假设成立 — — 即富人能够进行足够的储蓄 — — 那么只要平均资本回报率r高于总体经济增长率g，继承财富与收入（或工资）之比将呈现不断扩大趋势。	Under plausible assumptions – namely that the wealthy save enough – the ratio of inherited wealth to income (or wages) continues to increase as long as r, the average rate of return to capital, exceeds g, the growth rate of the economy as a whole.
欧盟从2014年以来一直在试图为解决这个问题制定一个一致框架。 当时它发布了一份关于产业政策利弊的分析。	The European Union has been trying to define a consistent framework for addressing the topic since 2014, when it published an analysis of industrial policy’s advantages and disadvantages.
从历史上看，结束长期冲突 — — 如镇压20世纪70年代在柬埔寨实施种族清洗的红色高棉 — — 需要依靠全面的战略，解除武装不是最重要的。	Historically, ending longstanding conflicts – for example, taming the Khmer Rouge, which had been responsible for the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s – has depended on comprehensive strategies that have not put disarmament first.
因此，中国可能会希望看到，例如，修改国际货币基金组织的工作或在国际货币基金组织的工作议程中增设一“章程 ” ， 以制约美国的货币供应量和债务积累。	So China might like to see, for example, amendments to the IMF mandate or the addition of a “chapter” to the IMF’s working agenda that discipline America’s money supply and debt accumulation.
如果他果真像他所说的那样对布吕尼爱得死去活来而且想要大操大办与她结婚，那么为何不利用即将到来的印度之行并让这一婚礼永志不忘呢？	If he really is as head-over-heels in love with Bruni as he claims, and plans to marry her imminently, why not take advantage of his upcoming trip to India and make this a wedding to remember?
在正常运转的民主国家中，这出政治大戏通常仍局限于选举和公投范畴 — — 如英国投票脱离欧盟和民粹主义局外人唐纳德·特朗普赢得美国总统大选。	In functioning democracies, the political drama usually remains confined to elections and referenda – such as the British vote to leave the European Union and the US presidential election, won by the populist outsider Donald Trump.
但严格来说，这确实意味着即便你相信日本央行的这些举措为使日本从低迷经济中走出来是必要的，它们肯定也是不充分的。	But, critically, it does mean that even if you believe that the BOJ’s actions are necessary for Japan to emerge from its economic malaise, they certainly are not sufficient.
这意味着专家们将定期召开会议，其权限也将得到扩展，而不仅仅是更新双税条约（double-taxation treaty）样板。	This meant that the experts would meet regularly and have an expanded mandate that went beyond merely updating a model double-taxation treaty.
在2016年的民主党总统初选中，自称社会主义者的佛蒙特州参议员伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）抨击了美国不平等性恶化的问题，而事实上，他也比许多人所预料的更加接近于当选总统。	In his 2016 Democratic primary campaign, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist, condemned America’s rising inequality and actually came closer to being elected president than many had expected.
芬兰通过投资于不受特定企业或行业局限、不受计算机化趋势影响的可转移技能，为如何适应技术升级提供了一份蓝图。	By investing in transferable skills that are not limited to specific businesses or industries, or susceptible to computerization, Finland has provided a blueprint for how to adapt to technological upheaval.
城市地区也许还需要设计合理的、可持续的基础设施来管理空气和水，以及集成清洁能源系统和高效的公共交通选择来降低污染和碳排放。	Urban areas may also need well-designed, sustainably built infrastructure to manage air and water, and integrated clean-energy systems and efficient public-transit options to help reduce pollution and carbon emissions.
在6月24日的第一起案件中，42岁的嘎玛桑珠（中国大陆地区最富有的西藏商人之一）被新疆地区一所法院以盗窃文物罪判刑15年。	In the first trial, on June 24, Karma Samdrup, 42, one of the wealthiest Tibetan businessmen in China, received a 15-year sentence from a court in Xinjiang for stealing antiques.
特朗普的许多具体政策方案本身已经足够令人担忧，但从他所说的关于一系列内政外交事务的内容（包括讲话和推特）看更加令人担忧。	Many of Trump’s specific policy proposals are worrisome enough in themselves; but they are even more worrisome in light of what he has said (viva voce and via Twitter) about a host of domestic and international issues.
如果他真的采取了这样的措施，据彼得森国际经济研究所估算无论实际来源是国产还是进口，美国的新车都可能增加1，400到7，000美元不等的成本。	If he follows through, the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the cost of a new car in the US could increase by $1,400-$7,000, regardless of whether it is made domestically or abroad.
但法国最优秀的政策经济学家之一让·皮萨尼-费里（Jean Pisani-Ferry）最近以政府智库法国战略研究所（France Stratégie）主任的身份加入马克龙团队，出任竞选计划主任。	But Jean Pisani-Ferry, one of the best policy economists in France, recently resigned as director of the government think tank France Stratégie to become Macron’s program director.
最近全球爆发的反抗说明一些公民已经意识到 ： （ 政界）赋予他们的（候选人）选择都是谬误的，甚至跟选择牙刷品牌一样毫无意义。	Recent rebellions worldwide show that some citizens recognize that they are being offered false choices, often no more meaningful than the choice between brands of toothpaste.
在去年五月，这位变革力量的代理人在开罗与法塔赫草签了一份和解协议，承诺要将哈马斯整合到一个巴勒斯坦联合政府之下，呼吁停止暴力行动，并接受在1967年边界基础上建立巴勒斯坦国的安排。	Last May, he signed an initial reconciliation agreement with Fatah in Cairo, which committed Hamas to a Palestinian unity government, called for a cessation of violence, and accepted the notion of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.
但只有给新兴经济体在全球治理上的真正的话语权 — — 从而减少信任赤字、重塑多边机构正统性 — — 才能让全球经济实现潜能。	But only by giving emerging economies a real voice in global governance – thereby reducing the trust deficit and restoring legitimacy to multilateral institutions – can the global economy reach its potential.
所有这些将在金融市场参与者中间引起一个预期，即央行和政府永远会出手干预平稳地消灭信用泡沫，减轻信用泡沫的后果，即使这意味着积累更多债务。	All of this would raise expectations among financial-market actors that central banks and governments would always step in to smooth out credit bubbles and mitigate their consequences, even if that meant accumulating more debt.
更重要的是，愿意达成协议的积极的日本对于推进前瞻思维和均衡贸易日程来说是一个有用的盟友，特别是在TTIP和TPP方向不同的情况下。	More significant, an engaged Japan that is willing to reach a deal will be a useful ally in pushing a forward-thinking and balanced trade agenda, particularly as the TTIP and the TPP appear headed for difficult waters.
"他们可能会过度强调经济成功的可能性 （ "" 我会在未来几年赚很多钱 "" ） 但却对时时威胁家庭预算的问题考虑不足 （ "" 我会失业或离婚 "" ） 。"	"They may overemphasize the likelihood of economic success (""I will be making a lot more money in a few years"") and underemphasize the commonplace problems that regularly challenge family budgets (""I will be losing my job or getting a divorce"")."
执政后的哈马斯是否会变得务实而且减低从事恐怖主义目前不得而知。 这当然有可能，但是我们不应该提前判断结果。	It is still an open question whether Hamas in government will become more pragmatic and less committed to terrorism: it certainly is a possibility, and one should not prejudge the outcome.
技术上，私密货币的供给是无限的：比特币的上限是2,100万个单位，但如果绝大多数“矿工 ” （ 向公开账目上增加分布式记账记录的人）同意，这一上限可以提高。	Technically, the supply of cryptocurrencies is infinite: bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, but this can be increased if a majority of “miners” (who add transaction records to the public ledger) agree.
但他也承诺保持退休金福利，并且他更加偏好北欧式的弹性安全（flexicurity）社会模式 — — 即高水平的经济安全与市场激励相结合。	But he has promised to maintain pension benefits, and his preferred social model appears to be Nordic-style flexicurity – a combination of high levels of economic security with market-based incentives.
在阿富汗的不自量力以及在大韩航空007航班坠毁事件上的撒谎让苏联体制的腐败暴露于众。 加速腐败导致苏联的崩溃难以避免。	By overplaying its hand in Afghanistan and lying to the world about the downing of KAL 007, the Soviet regime exposed and accelerated the rot that made its collapse inevitable.
类似地，几乎没有交易成本的集中式电子支付系统 — — Faster Payments、支付宝、微信支付、Venmo、Paypal、Square等 — — 在全世界已有数十亿人正在使用。	Similarly, centralized e-payment systems with almost no transaction costs – Faster Payments, AliPay, WeChat Pay, Venmo, Paypal, Square – are already being used by billions of people around the world.
并不只有哥本哈根做出这样的假设；英国能源与气候变化部预测到2030年化石燃料发电电价会出现51%的涨幅。	And Copenhagen is not alone in making such assumptions; the United Kingdom’s Department of Energy & Climate Change estimates a 51% price increase by 2030.
在那时，穆斯林的思想家们将他们自己社会的衰落与欧洲的活力进行对比。 欧洲成功地将穆斯林世界的很大部分殖民化的事实使得这种差别尤为痛苦。	Back then, Muslim thinkers contrasted the decline of their own societies with Europe's dynamism, a particularly painful distinction in light of European successes in colonizing large parts of the Muslim world.
至少在表面上，希腊和意大利国内非民选技术官僚在政治上的日益崛起已经暗示着：那条多年以来的禁忌 — — 不能让技术官僚政府在政治议程上唯欧盟马首是瞻 — — 已经被打破了。	The rise of unelected technocrats to political power in Greece and Italy suggests, at least superficially, that the old taboo against technocratic governments pursuing an EU-dictated agenda has been shattered.
即使美国的最终目的是迫使巴沙尔下台，其迫不及待的举动也会增加巴沙尔的抵抗，并且触犯其在联合国安理会的两大盟友俄罗斯和中国。	Even if the US ultimately sought to force Assad from office, its blunt action hardened Assad’s resistance, as well as that of his two allies in the UN Security Council, Russia and China.
这意味着IMF各成员国 — — 不管是发达经济体、新兴市场还是发展中经济体 — — 有更多的工作要做。	This means that the IMF’s members – whether advanced, emerging-market, or developing economies – have more work to do.
相反他们应采取更为细致的做法，一方面着通过投资选定的地区和市场来改善自身风险回报，一方面与合适的机构开展合作。	Instead, they should adopt a more nuanced approach, one focused on improving the risk-return profile by investing in selected regions and markets, while working with the right institutions.
接着，突然，国际货币基金组织已经作为似乎是能够阻止当前绑架新兴市场股票和债券的恶性下降螺旋趋势的唯一机构，来到了舞台的中心。	Suddenly, the Fund has moved to center stage as the only agency seemingly capable of stemming the vicious downward spiral that is currently seizing emerging-market stocks and bonds.
或者，这是因为预测者被暗示经济处于充分就业状态、财政扩张的唯一结果只能是通货膨胀的经济模型所迷惑了吗？	Or was it because the forecasters were in thrall to economic models that implied that economies were at full employment, in which case the only result of fiscal expansion would be inflation?
在能量与激情的推动下，波顿将BCHD打造成了欣欣向荣的健康（而非医疗）机构，其服务范围覆盖了洛杉矶西侧三座城市的30万人。	With energy and enthusiasm, Burden turned that operation into a thriving health (not health-care) agency that covers three cities and about 300,000 people on the western edge of Los Angeles.
事实上，它可能会掩盖一些重要的经验教训，这些教训不仅可以帮助埃及，还可以协助其他新兴经济体发挥其巨大潜力 — — 而且不仅限于足球方面。	Indeed, it risks obscuring important lessons that can help not just Egypt, but also other emerging economies, to fulfill their considerable potential – and not just in soccer.
这类投资的持续增长反映出数字化浪潮 — — 也是这一生产力增长疲软时期的第二个突出特点 — — 如今正席卷各个行业。	Continued growth in such investment reflects the wave of digitization – the second outstanding feature of this period of anemic productivity growth – that is now sweeping across industries.
他害怕乌克兰2014年起义演变为一场“革命的瘟疫 ” ， 仅仅因为同样的起义可能发生在莫斯科自己的广场上。	He fears Ukraine’s 2014 uprising as a “revolutionary plague” only because it might erupt in Moscow’s own squares.
这样，富兰克林·罗斯福可以在敦促美国人不让世界“落入 希特勒 和 墨索里尼 主宰”的同时，告诉他们“我们正在对 日本 发动战争 。 ”	Thus, Franklin Roosevelt could simultaneously urge Americans to keep the world from being “dominated by Hitler and Mussolini ,” even as he told them that “we are now in the midst of a war against Japan .”
近4亿人已经在LinkedIn上发布了自己的简历，2014年该网站在世界各地促成了一百多万次新的雇佣。	Nearly 400 million people have posted their resumes on LinkedIn, and in 2014 the site facilitated more than one million new hires worldwide.
会计复查账本，经历者把自己的故事告诉报纸（有时则是向法官陈述 ） ， 政客解释清理混乱的原因，最后由历史学家汇成一个完整的故事。	Accountants go over the books, the participants tell their tales to the newspapers (or sometimes before a judge), politicians explain why they are sorting out a mess, and in the end historians put together a story.
但在目前看来，有一种对立正在不断凸显，并可能重新塑造21世纪的左右派区分形式：在政策制定原则中对风险的预防性态度与“主动性”态度。	But one division that looms on the horizon could reinvent the right-left distinction for the twenty-first century: precautionary versus “proactionary” attitudes toward risk as principles of policymaking.
此外，中国是美国第三大出口市场（仅次于加拿大和墨西哥 ） ， 也是扩张最快的出口市场 — — 对于增长萎靡的美国经济来说，中国可谓牵一发而动全身。	Moreover, China is America’s third-largest export market (after Canada and Mexico) and the one that is expanding most rapidly – hardly inconsequential for a growth-starved US economy.
全球气候变化谈判同样也以失败告终，在新一轮全球资源争夺战中如何确保食品、能源安全这个问题，也充满了分歧。	Global climate-change negotiations have similarly ended in failure, and disagreement reigns concerning how to address food and energy security amid a new scramble for global resources.
埃及现金告急 — — 在最近的援助贷款之前，货币储备只能维持不到三个月的进口 — — 预料会出现未来短缺的埃及人纷纷囤积燃料和食品。	Egypt is running low on cash – before recent rescue loans, currency reserves covered less than three months of imports – and Egyptians are hoarding fuel and foodstuffs in anticipation of future shortages.
AfD诞生于2013年，最初是一个批判欧元的“教授政党 ” ， 其中很多成员是经济自由派，新自由主义也一直是流淌在其血液中的DNA。	The AfD was born in 2013 as a euro-critical “party of professors,” many of them economic liberals, and neoliberalism remains part of their offspring’s DNA.
中国领导人担心终端高空区域防御系统（萨德）影响到中国的安全，破坏地区战略平衡，因为它可以监控中国领土上起飞的飞机和发射的导弹。	Chinese leaders worry that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system will undermine its security and disrupt the regional strategic balance, by monitoring flights and missile launches in Chinese territory.
意大利超过90%的选民不赞成西尔维奥·布鲁斯科尼总理恢复核能发电的计划，而日本政府不久前宣布了分阶段逐步淘汰核能的计划。	In Italy, more than 90% of voters rejected Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s plan for a return to nuclear-power generation, and the Japanese government recently announced that it plans to phase out nuclear energy in stages.
由于大多数媒体的注意力都转移到了黎巴嫩，以色列可以从容不迫地继续给巴勒斯坦人施加压力而不招致国际社会的抗议。	Because most media attention has shifted to Lebanon, the Israelis have had a free hand to continue pressing the Palestinians without international protest.
2012年，奥巴马总统签署了便利真正的众筹企业的美国创业企业扶助法（Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act ） ， 这也是一项实验。	When the United States’ Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, which facilitated true crowd-funding of enterprises, was signed by President Barack Obama in 2012, it was an experiment, too.
真实标注普尔综合股价指数成分股过去十年每股收益增长与未来十年真实盈利增长为负相关（1881年以来为-17 % ） 。	And real earnings growth per share for the S&P Composite Stock Price Index over the previous ten years was negatively correlated (-17% since 1881) with real earnings growth over the subsequent ten years.
高企的能源价格（因为消费税和电费的增加 ） 、 信用瓶颈、细分专长恰好位于停滞出口市场，以及总体政策不确定都在起作用。	Higher energy costs (owing to increases in both excise taxes and electricity rates), credit bottlenecks, specialization in stagnant export markets, and generalized policy uncertainty all seem to have played a role.
如果中共因为公众对政治参与不足和长期社会压迫的不满而感到威胁，就可能滑向竞争性民族主义，颠覆已然摇摇欲坠的地区现状。	If the Chinese Communist Party feels threatened by a public frustrated with insufficient political participation and enduring social repression, it could slip into competitive nationalism, upending the already-delicate regional status quo.
由于大多数货币市场基金的资产都是那些来自各大银行的金融要求权，赎回行动削弱了本已摇摇欲坠的全球银行系统。	Since much of the money-market funds’ assets are IOUs from the world’s biggest banks, the withdrawals weakened the already-shaky global banking system.
向联合国提交了“九段线”地图后，中国陷入了一个无法取胜的局面，因为难以在国际法的框架下为这幅地图辩护。	Having tabled the nine-dotted line at the UN, China walked into a no-win situation, owing to the difficulty of defending the map under international law.
此等中产阶级包括有产工薪人士，其中不乏年轻人，将政府视作法律客观的执行者和中立的纠纷调停人，而不是谋求资金和恩惠的去处。	That middle class consists of propertied, salaried people, many of them young, who see government as an impersonal enforcer of the law and a neutral arbiter of disputes, rather than as a source of funds and favors.
但是，尽管历史充满了得到怯懦和受骗大众拥戴的杀戮性政权，民主国家更大的风险则是其公民退回到无动于衷以及为了当下的满足所进行的急功近利式的思考。	But, while history is replete with murderous regimes applauded by cowed and deceived masses, the greater risk for democratic nations is that their citizens withdraw into apathy and short-term thinking for immediate gratification.
20世纪六七十年代的越南战争、美元停止兑换黄金、1973年石油价格冲击以及大滞涨等事件对全球化进程形成了干扰。	This globalization process was interrupted during the late 1960s and early 1970s, owing to the Vietnam War, the suspension of the US dollar’s convertibility into gold, the 1973 oil price shock, and the great stagflation.
特别是，有大量证据表明伊斯兰革命卫队（Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ，IRGC）分裂成两大派别，一派支持贾里里，另一派支持卡利巴夫。	In particular, there is strong evidence that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) split into two major factions, with one supporting Jalili and the other backing Qalibaf.
但是，当美国将国际社会的领导权交给中国之前，我们应该看到中国不但存在着国内政治分歧，而且也不能使其国内政治与其不断增长的国际责任协调一致。	But, before the US hands over international leadership to the Chinese, it would be instructive to look at China’s own internal political divisions and inability to synchronize its domestic politics with its growing global responsibilities.
与此同时，在处理与发达国家对手的关系时，中国应该采取开放和务实的方针，倡导将发达国家和发展中国家联系在一起的包容的全球政策日程。	At the same time, in dealing with its advanced-country counterparts, it should be open and pragmatic, championing an inclusive global policy agenda that connects the developed and developing worlds.
大多数人也不会预料到中国对全球公共品贡献的日益增加，包括其旨在提供将欧亚地区（Eurasia）打造成一个单一巨大市场所需要的基础设施的“一带一路”战略。	Nor would most have anticipated China’s increasing provision of global public goods, including its “one belt, one road” strategy, which aims to provide the infrastructure needed to knit Eurasia into a single vast market.
在这种情况下应该受到责备的失败 — — 特别是性命攸关时，不是不同意科学家的意见，而是拒绝将科学作为一种探究的方法。	The culpable failure, especially when lives are at stake, is not to disagree with scientists, but to reject science as a method of inquiry.
此外，二十世纪三十年代事实上的内战所留下的伤疤并没有得到愈合：相互的猜疑和对血腥大屠杀的记忆使相互合作和信任变得不再可能。	Moreover, the scars of the 1930’s virtual civil war have still not healed: mutual suspicion and memories of internecine massacres vitiated cooperation and trust.
通过增税使消费转向投资是有可能的，但在政治上很成问题，因为责任由谁分担的问题往往最终会导致僵局与不作为。	Shifting consumption to investment via tax increases is possible, but too problematic politically, with the burden-sharing issue usually leading to impasse and inaction.
1996年的特别重大杀戮事件后，新任总理霍华德（John Howard）宣布，够了已经够了（enough was enough ） 。	After a particularly horrible massacre in 1996, a new prime minister, John Howard, declared that enough was enough.
然而西方各大央行 — — 甚至包括传统上一向“鹰派”的欧洲中央银行 — — 似乎都像鸵鸟一样把头埋在了沙里。	All the major Western central banks – including even the traditionally “hawkish” ECB – appear to be sticking their heads in the sand.
而更优秀之处在于央行数字货币不必仰仗于加密货币赖以构建的公开“免许可 ” ， “非信任”分布式记账。	Better yet, CBDCs would not have to rely on public “permission-less,” “trustless” distributed ledgers like those underpinning cryptocurrencies.
2012年，希腊债务-GDP之比一飞冲天，其私人债权人惨遭34%的“剃头 ” （ haircut ） 。	In 2012, as the debt-to-GDP ratio skyrocketed, Greece’s private creditors were given a significant 34% haircut.
除此之外还面临着内忧外患 — — 包括伊斯兰主义兴起、内战和人口大规模逃离冲突区 — — 一些阿拉伯国家的未来面临不确定性。	Add to that external and internal pressures – including from surging Islamism, civil wars, and mass migration from conflict zones – and the future of several Arab countries appears uncertain.
一个很好的出发点是寻求达成叙利亚和平协议，以使该国的不同社会 — — 目前他们处于互相杀戮的状态 — — 共同生活在这个国家中。	A good place to start would be to seek a Syrian peace deal that enables the country’s different communities – now butchering each other – to live in one state.

阿根廷的克里斯蒂娜·基什内尔、巴西的罗塞夫、冰岛的西于尔扎多蒂（Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir）以各种各样的方式为女性赋权并帮助她们在各自国家提高地位。	Leaders like Argentina’s Cristina Kirchner, Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, and Iceland’s Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir have all sought, in one way or another, to empower women and help them advance in their countries.
但是，尽管这种想法很值得赞赏，对于“恰当”的差异水平以及相互接近的正确速度并没有“科学的真实性 ” 。	But, however admirable this sentiment may be, there is no “scientific truth” about the “right” level of disparities and the correct speed of convergence.
作为2008金融危机之后的快速反应措施，G20在协调各国政府行动并防止贸易保护主义蔓延方面都有所建树。	In the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the G-20 seemed to help governments to coordinate their actions and avoid rampant protectionism.
他的思维是有多少利润和损失会立刻兑现 — — 他宣布美国的盟友需要为安全联盟做出更大贡献便是这一世界观的明证。	He thinks in terms of immediate profits and losses – a worldview that is exemplified in his declarations that US allies need to contribute more to security alliances.
为了对付这一果蝇，全球著名的东非ICIPE研究所最近前往斯里兰卡寻找天敌。 研究人员现在已经确定了一种天敌。	In a bid to counter the fly, a team from the world-renowned ICIPE institute in East Africa recently went to Sri Lanka looking for a natural predator.
低水平和稳定的通货膨胀，持续增长和高就业水平让许多人觉得中央银行犹如某种宇宙主宰，能够（并被认定）为所有人的福祉而管理经济。	Low and stable inflation, sustained growth, and high employment led many to view central banks as a kind of master of the universe, able – and expected – to manage the economy for the benefit of all.

阿姆斯特丹—作为一名盎格鲁-荷兰人 — — 母亲是英国人，父亲是荷兰人 — — 我无法不将英国退出视为个人大事。	AMSTERDAM – As an Anglo-Dutchman – British mother, Dutch father – I cannot help but take Brexit rather personally.
半决赛中，失去英雄内马尔的巴西队似乎陷入了瘫痪，内马尔和贝利球衣号码相同，但在之前那场比赛中严重受伤。	In the semifinal, Brazil appeared to be paralyzed without its hero, Neymar, who wore the same number as Pelé but had been badly injured in the previous match.
首先，欧洲央行重启债券购买时必须明确要将主权利率降低到可持续水平的目标，而可持续水平至少要比七月份的平均利率低200个基点。	First, the ECB’s renewed bond purchases must express the clear intention of reducing sovereign interest rates to sustainable levels, which are at least 200 basis points below their July averages.

尽管前不久扎卡维被美军在伊拉克击毙，但伊拉克和阿富汗的局势发展根本不能为布什政府的乐观看法提供理由。	Despite the recent death of Zarqawi in Iraq, the situation there, and in Afghanistan, does not justify the continued Bush administration’s optimism.
通过对能源消费实行高税收，欧洲人可以降低能源消费和国际市场上的能源价格，从而切断流向俄国和伊朗的资金。	By imposing a stiff tax on energy consumption, Europeans would reduce both consumption of energy and its price in world markets, in turn cutting the flow of funds to Russia and Iran.

在西方，自由先于民主产生：权力分隔、言论自由和法治在精英同意扩大公民权和群众治国（popular rule）之前便已存在。	In the West, liberalism preceded democracy: separation of powers, freedom of expression, and the rule of law were already in place before elites agreed to expand the franchise and submit to popular rule.

东京 — — 最近，日本因就日称尖阁列岛、中国称钓鱼岛的6平方公里的荒芜小岛与中国爆发争端而频频登上媒体头条。	TOKYO – Japan has been in the news lately, owing to its dispute with China over six square kilometers of barren islets in the East China Sea that Japan calls the Senkakus and China calls the Diaoyu Islands.

“气候传教”正是对 IPCC 所作所为的一个写照，因为它夸大了气候变化的某些影响，目的则是吸引政治家的关注。	Climate evangelism is an apt description of what the IPCC has been up to, for it has exaggerated some of the ramifications of climate change in order to make politicians take note.
有了新近获得的比较优势，他们可以积累不恰当的利润，将不义之财再投资于攫取更多不公平的租金（rent ） 。	With their newly acquired competitive advantages, they can accrue undue profits, reinvesting part of their haul in acquiring even more unfair rents.

这些宪法规定防止了各州出现欧元区那样的赤字和借贷问题，而资本市场也忽略了各单一欧洲国家缺乏货币独立性的事实。	These constitutional rules prevent the kind of deficit and debt problems that have beset the eurozone, where capital markets ignored individual countries’ lack of monetary independence.
已故的苹果公司创始人兼CEO史蒂夫·乔布斯是一位精明的商人，但让iPhone变得“智能”的每一项技术都是国家投钱开发的。	The late Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs was a smart businessman, but every technology that makes the iPhone “smart” was developed with state funding.
事实上，2004年的2月10日，曼昆一觉醒来时，等待他的却是《华盛顿邮报》上一篇令人生厌的报导 ： “ 布什总统的首席经济学家昨天声称对美国的服务性工作实行海外采购有利于美国经济的发展 . . . .

但是，建立可持续的包容经济固然需要商界领导力和集体行动（这也是敝委员会的报告的核心观点之一 ） ， 光靠私人部门的努力是不够的。	But, while business leadership and collective action are needed to create a sustainable and inclusive economy (a central message of our commission’s report), the private sector cannot do it alone.
罗马和雅典 — — 西方古典文明的两大起源 — — 的政权将回归温文尔雅、学富五车的精英人士，这不可不谓归得其所。	It is fitting that Rome and Athens, the two seats of classical Western civilization, have turned to these two urbane, erudite men for leadership.
这导致了世界贸易的崩盘，1932年世界贸易量下降60 % ， 让“大萧条”有了“大”字，也促成了德国和日本的偏激民族主义。	That contributed to a collapse in world trade, which fell 60% by 1932, helping to put the “Great” in “Great Depression” and facilitating the rise of rabid nationalism in Germany and Japan.
纽约—半个世纪前，约翰·肯尼迪观察道 ： “ 人类可以依靠平凡的双手战胜一切人类贫困，打造任何人类生活 。 ”	NEW YORK – A half-century ago, John F. Kennedy observed that, “man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.”
出口导向区只专注于生产出口品，它应该投资者提供税收激励、基本基础设施和服务、安全以及稳定的法律框架。	The ERZ, focused exclusively on producing goods for export, would provide tax incentives, basic infrastructure and services, security, and a stable legal framework to investors.

拉斐尔·迪·特拉（Rafael Di Tella）和罗伯特·麦考洛克（Robert MacCulloch）指出，世界上最贫穷的国家的特征不是天真地相信资本主义，而是完全不相信资本主义，这导致了大规模政府干预和商业管制。	As Rafael Di Tella and Robert MacCulloch have shown, the world’s poorest countries are not characterized by naive trust in capitalism, but by utter distrust, which leads to heavy government intervention and regulation of business.
但它也无法成为有用的先例，因为它建立了一个不切实际的工资底线 — — 比墨西哥制造业总体平均水平高出许多倍 。	But it is not an altogether salutary precedent either, insofar as it sets an unrealistic wage floor – many multiples higher than the average for the Mexican manufacturing sector as a whole.
为了确保数字经济的持续健康发展，应对突破性技术进步所带来的产业与社会风险，中国需要实施明智的监管机制。	If China is to ensure the continued development of its digital economy, while containing the risks associated with disruption, its leaders will need to implement smart regulations.
阿拉伯人可能永远不会接受锡安主义的道德正确性，但是，阿拉伯和平计划（Arab Peace Initiative）表明，他们会考虑接受以色列国的政治合法性。	The Arabs might never accept the moral justice of Zionism, but, as the Arab Peace Initiative indicates, they would consider accepting the political legitimacy of a Jewish state.

此外，担心SNB独立性的人也许会问一个根本性问题：如果不忽视那些抱怨央行不够利润导向的人，独立性有什么意义？	And, to those who are concerned for the SNB's independence, one might ask a fundamental question: What is independence for if not to ignore those who complain that the central bank is insufficiently profit-oriented?
对许多美国人来说，大选展示了这个国家最好的一面，但随之而来的是人们已耳熟能详的英雄被赶下神坛的桥段。	For many Americans, the election demonstrated what is best about the country, only to be followed by the sadly familiar process of knocking heroes off their pedestals.

中国政府的宏大的一带一路计划 — — 构建贯穿欧亚的贸易基础设施 — — 带来了大量用商业合同行使政治影响力的机会。	The Chinese government’s massive Belt and Road Initiative to build trade infrastructure throughout Eurasia provides ample opportunities to use business contracts to wield political influence.

这种争吵将分散法院的注意力和精力，使其不能完成更重要的职能，那就是为前南斯拉夫地区平民所遭受的严重罪行提供公平有效的审判并追究犯罪者的责任。	Such a debate would have diverted attention and energy from the imperative of fairly and effectively providing justice and accountability for the grave crimes then being committed against civilians in the former Yugoslavia.
缩减地方政府系统和巴基斯坦脆弱的民主制度的联合政府的政治分裂的同时发生继续阻碍着消灭小儿麻痹症项目的实施。	The simultaneous scaling back of the local-government system, along with the divisive politics of coalition governments in Pakistan’s fragile democracy, continues to undermine implementation of the polio eradication program.
在奥地利和其他国家的压力下，欧洲央行又花了一年时间才与匈牙利和波兰央行最终建立适当的外汇抵押品货币互换额度。	It took another year for the ECB, under pressure from Austria and other countries, to establish proper swap lines against foreign-currency collateral with the Hungarian and Polish central banks.
研究表明，即使是在民主社会中，女性在进行与职业生涯资源有关的谈判（比如薪资谈判）时所面临的社会风险也要高于男性。	Research shows that even in democratic societies, women face a higher social risk than men when attempting to negotiate for career-related resources such as compensation.
正如法国总统戴高乐曾经抱怨的那样 ， “ 因为美元在哪里都是被报价币，其它国家会因为美元的管理不善而受到影响。	As French President Charles de Gaulle once complained, “since the dollar is the reference currency everywhere, it can cause others to suffer the effects of its poor management.
事实上，正在接受技术、经济和社会快速变化考验的不仅限于威斯特伐利亚国家体系本身，而且还包括战后建立的地缘政治模式。	In fact, it is the Westphalian state system itself, not just the postwar geopolitical paradigm, which is being tested by rapid technological, economic, and social changes.
而那些被企业捐助者们好酒好肉伺候着的最高法院法官则在臭名昭着的公民联合会判决中为这些腐败资金的保密开了绿灯。	Supreme Court justices who themselves were frequently wined and dined by corporate donors gave the green light to keep these corrupt flows secret in their infamous Citizens United decision.
一旦世界走上实现可持续发展目标的正轨，冲突的数量和规模就会减少，自然灾害将得到更好的预测或预防，从而导致维和及紧急救援行动的需求下降。	Once the world is on a robust path to achieve the SDGs, the need for, say, peacekeeping and emergency-relief operations should decline as conflicts diminish in number and scale, and natural disasters are better prevented or anticipated.
因为特朗普充满敌意的推特和令人震惊的公开言论往往都会引来其内阁高级官员的更加谨慎的声明，金正恩可能根本没有认真对待。	Because Trump’s hostile tweets and swaggering public utterances are usually followed by more cautious statements from senior members of his cabinet, Kim might not take them seriously.
与此同时，各种穆斯林兄弟会将在叙利亚掌权，就像“阿拉伯觉醒”在中东各地正在造成或将要造成的局面一样。	At the same time, a variant of the Muslim Brotherhood will come to power in Syria, as has been or will be the case almost everywhere in the Middle East as a result of the “Arab Awakening.”
北京 — — 2017年初，中国宣布截止2020年将投资3，600亿美元用于发展可再生能源，并废除建设85座燃煤电厂的计划。	BEIJING – At the start of 2017, China announced that it would invest $360 billion in renewable energy by 2020 and scrap plans to build 85 coal-fired power plants.

亚洲拥有世界增长最快的经济体、膨胀最迅速的军费开支、最激烈的资源竞争。 而最重要的热点在于，全球秩序的钥匙显然含在亚洲嘴里。	With the world’s fastest-growing economies, fastest-rising military expenditures, fiercest resource competition, and most serious hot spots, Asia obviously holds the key to the future global order.
发自曼彻斯特 — — 刚刚落幕的英国议会大选本应形成一个(如保守党的竞选宣传口号所言 ) “ 强大而稳定”的政府。	MANCHESTER – The United Kingdom’s just-completed election was supposed to provide – as the Conservative Party’s campaign slogan put it – a “strong and stable” government.
但这些进展仍有昙花一现的可能，因为决策者、商业领袖和投资者着眼于短期考虑而不顾全球经济所面临的威胁。	And yet the risk remains that these gains will be frittered away, as policymakers, business leaders, and investors focus on short-term concerns at the expense of looming threats to the global economy.
20世纪30年代，随着欧洲落入暴君或陈腐的民主领袖手中，美国的考夫林和其他人在弗兰克林·罗斯福总统新政的对比之下显得黯然失色。	In the 1930s, as Europe drifted into the hands of either tyrants or banal democratic leaders, America’s Coughlins and others were overshadowed by President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.
这一基调似乎意味着对与该政权打交道的漫长过程的理解。 但奥巴马为巩固美国的利益可能愿意努力到什么程度则仍然是个未知数。	This formulation seems to suggest an understanding of the often-lengthy process of dealing with its regime, but it remains unclear how far Obama might be willing to go to secure America’s interests.
这一相对较小的投资将带来非凡的收益，尤其是每年可以预防140例神经管缺陷死亡事件和超过25万例贫血。	This relatively small investment would deliver extraordinary benefits, not least by preventing 140 neural-tube-defect deaths and more than 250,000 cases of anemia every year.
影响美国复苏的阻力 — — 被破坏的家庭资产负债表、萧条的住房市场以及政府支出和就业的下降 — — 正在消失。	The headwinds buffeting the US recovery – impaired household balance sheets, a depressed housing market, and government spending and employment cuts – are dissipating.
第三，卡什卡利提出手段的时机与新“区块链（blockchain ） ” 技术的到来恰巧同步，使得人们可能以更分散的方式来组织金融交易。	Third, Kashkari’s timing coincides with the arrival of new “blockchain” technology, which makes it possible to organize financial transactions in a more decentralized way.
在拉辛格枢机主教（Cardinal Ratzinger）成为本笃十六世前，他接受了一次采访，在采访中他谴责“生物的工业使用 ” ， 比如母鸡生活得“如此‘憋屈 ’ ， 活像是讽刺漫画上的鸟类 。 ”	Before Cardinal Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI, he gave an interview in which he deplored the “industrial use of creatures” such as hens living “so packed together that they become just caricatures of birds.”

因此尽管反对的理据铺天盖地，共和党人仍将继续欺骗自己，假装自己那套供给侧的涓滴型税收政策是会起作用的。	So, it looks like Republicans will continue to delude themselves that supply-side, trickle-down tax policies work, in spite of the overwhelming weight of evidence to the contrary.

布什政府辩解说推进民主所付出的高昂代价和风险大大低于容许独裁现状在中东无限期延续所付出的代价，这种说法也许有一定的道理。	The Bush administration may be correct in arguing that the extremely high costs and risks of promoting democracy are less than the costs and risks of allowing the authoritarian status quo in the Middle east to persist indefinitely.
而德国社会民主党党首马丁·舒尔茨（Martin Schulz）也在最近加入了支持“欧罗巴合众国”的行列。	And the leader of Germany’s Social Democrats, Martin Schulz, has also thrown his weight behind a “United States of Europe” in recent days.
但是要将适应一个国家的军队在一夜之间改变成为远征部队是不可能的，而且改革的开支还经常与为军事行动部署军队所需的开支竞争。	But it is not possible to convert territorial forces into expeditionary forces overnight, and the costs of transformation often must compete with the costs of deploying forces for operations.

在现时代，资本流出导致就业流出，技术转移导致国内生产可以再配置到外国 — — 从而加剧潜在就业损失。	In our own time, the emigration of capital has led to the emigration of jobs, as technology transfer has made possible the reallocation of domestic production to foreign locations – thus compounding the potential for job losses.
毕竟 ， “ 鱼鹰”的安全风险相对于朝鲜导弹或中国侵犯该地区（尤其是附近的钓鱼岛）的所引发的安全威胁来说简直是微不足道的。	After all, the Osprey’s safety risks are insignificant relative to the security threat posed by, say, a North Korean missile or Chinese aggression in the area, especially the nearby Senkaku Islands.
俄罗斯会震怒，因为它担心科索沃一旦分离，不管是否为国际所承认，都会进一步引发前苏联帝国内部主张独立的运动。	Russia would be furious, because it fears that Kosovo’s secession – whether or not it is internationally recognized – might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire.
特别是伊斯坦布尔的大公宗主教长制（Ecumenical Patriarchate）可以作为基督徒和穆斯林和平共处的范例。	In particular, the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul could be a great example of peaceful coexistence among Christians and Muslims.
证据还表明，一些甚至全部制裁，会随着时间最终取消，因为其他政府会接受一国的核地位，而专注于其他目标。	There is also evidence that some or all of the sanctions will eventually disappear, as other governments come to accept the reality of a country’s nuclear status and choose to focus on other objectives.
我们所知道的是，随着民众支持从大规模主流政党转向新贵政党和左右翼运动，整个欧盟的治理正变得越来越具有挑战性。	What we do know is that governance across the EU is becoming more challenging as large mainstream political parties lose support to upstart parties and movements of both the left and the right.

在所谓“单一性”的国家里，如英国。 法国、中国或肯尼 亚，基本上只有单一的一套政府义务：只有一支警察部队，公立学校教师只受雇于一个机构，只有一个总体的养老金制度，等等。	So-called “unitary” nations such as Britain, France, China, or Kenya, essentially have a single set of government obligations: one national police force, one employer for all public school teachers, one overall pension system, etc.
尽管如此，布哈林仍然配合斯大林清洗托洛茨基和其他坚守列宁遗训（以及他对斯大林的不利批评）的布尔什维克。	Nonetheless, Bukharin aligned with Stalin to purge Leon Trotsky and other Bolsheviks who sought to adhere more closely to Lenin’s dictates (and his testament against Stalin).

这一历史性胜利取决于让新芬党领导人参与其中。 这些爱尔兰共和国运动的领导人在许多情形下无法与爱尔兰共和军区分开来，而爱尔兰共和军则为了其政治目标对平民进行了轰炸和枪击并让他们落下终身残疾。	That historic triumph depended on bringing in Sinn Fein politicians – leaders of the Irish Republican movement who in many cases could not be distinguished from the IRA, which bombed, shot, and maimed civilians in pursuit of its political goals.
此外王储萨勒曼尽管有诸多缺点，但依然算是个改革者，知道自己国家的繁荣和王室的生存离不开开放和多元化。	Moreover, MBS, for all his faults, is something of a reformer, understanding that his country must open up and diversify if it is to thrive and the royal family is to survive.
比方说，与其说印度能源安全取决于掌握遥远脆弱国家的石油资产，还不如说取决于确保全球石油市场正常运行不受破坏。	India’s energy security, for example, depends not on owning oil assets in remote fragile countries, but on ensuring that the global oil market works well and is not disrupted.
为了从国外借款，美国必须拿出点什么给贸易伙伴来交换它们的资本 — — 这个交换物就是美国对海外制造产品的需求。	To borrow from abroad, America must give its trading partners something in return for their capital: US demand for products made overseas.
这对于发展中国家的影响尤其令人关注，因为许多发展中国家已经承受着中国减速对大宗商品价格的消极影响和干旱条件所导致的庄稼收成大降。	The effect on developing countries is of particular concern, because many are already reeling from the negative impact of China’s slowdown on commodity prices, and because drought conditions could lead to severe crop shortfalls.
切·格瓦拉炯炯的目光和缀着红星图案的贝雷帽被定格在阿尔贝托·科尔达的标志性照片中，催生了整整一代人的激情澎湃。	Che Guevara’s intense gaze and red-starred beret, captured in Alberto Korda’s iconic photograph, mobilized a generation.

菲永的支持者似乎一致反对同性恋婚姻，而自称天主教徒的菲永是迄今为止本次大选中社会观念最保守的候选人。	Fillon’s supporters seem to be united in their opposition to gay marriage, and Fillon, as an avowed Catholic, was the most socially conservative candidate on offer.
11月，道琼斯工业平均指数已站上19,000点，数不清的新闻报道都聚焦于它向20,0000点的冲击 — — 也许这篇评论发表的时候已经实现了。	The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been above 19,000 since November, and countless news stories have focused on its flirtation with the 20,000 barrier – which might be crossed by the time this commentary is published.
非洲领导人需要铲除贪污，加强能源公用事业治理（其中某些已经成为腐败和效率低下的核心）透明度、强化法律法规并加大对能源基础设施的公共投入。	African leaders need to root out graft, make the governance of energy utilities – some of which have been centers of corruption and inefficiency – more transparent, strengthen regulations, and increase public spending on energy infrastructure.
作为世界第三大经济体，日本的货币-收入比非常高（达到了20%左右 ） ， 因此比特币在日本取得成功是一场重大胜利。	Japan, the world’s third largest economy, has an extraordinarily high currency-to-income ratio (roughly 20%), so Bitcoin’s success there is a major triumph.
在此期间的大多数时候，凭借着货币政策委员会过往在稳定物价方面的杰出表现，英国公众都预期来年的通胀将比当年要低。	For most of this period, the British public expected inflation in the coming year to be lower than in the previous year, thanks to the MPC’s strong track record on price stability.
最近几十年来，大萧条最根本的内容在很多国家不断重复，唯一的区别是规模较小而已：通常的表现是金融市场先出现震荡，随之而来的就是国内生产总值急速下降。	The fundamental experience of the Great Depression has repeated itself, on a smaller scale, many times and in many countries in recent decades: a shock in financial markets, followed by a sharp decline in gross domestic product.
但即使能够实现独立划分选区，美国许多地区的选举仍将是非竞争性的，因为来自同一个政党的选民常常住得很近。	But even with independently drawn districts, elections in many parts of the country will not be competitive, because voters from the same party often live in close proximity.
支撑上述制度的伊拉克和叙利亚两国已经失去了中央政府，而且至少将在一代人的时间里无法摆脱政治分裂和社会分极。	The two states that gave weight to this system, Iraq and Syria, have lost their central authority, and will remain politically fragmented and socially polarized for at least a generation.
最重要的是，东道国政府可以帮助难民更加安全和自立，这主要可以通过提高他们的法律地位和扩大他们的工作权利实现。	Above all, host governments could help refugees become more secure and self-reliant, notably by upgrading their legal status and expanding the right to work.
加强常规免疫能够捍卫我们针对小儿麻痹症所取得的战果，让我们能够帮助到最难到达、服务水平最低的社区中的最脆弱的孩子。	Strengthening routine immunization will protect our gains against polio and enable us to reach the most vulnerable children in the hardest-to-reach and most underserved communities.
我接着问，为何他们中的大多数人又近乎本能地拥护自由贸易，而自由贸易其实也会导致一种类似的 — — 事实上甚至更大幅度的 — — 由输家到赢家的财富重新分配。	How is it possible, I asked, that almost all of them had instinctively favored free trade, which entails a similar – in fact, most likely greater – redistribution from losers to winners?
由于美元作为世界主要储备货币的地位，美国金融业得以在近几十年间为国际投资者提供一大堆诱人的金融产品。	Thanks to the dollar’s status as the world’s main reserve currency, the US financial industry has managed in recent decades to offer international investors a potpourri of alluring products.
现实情况是，虽然贝卢斯科尼肯定有他的魅力，但特朗普庞大的支持者群体似乎也在他身上看到了某种魅力元素（尽管特朗普的魅力可能没有那么富于诱惑 ） 。	The reality is that, while Berlusconi certainly has his charm, Trump’s swelling base of support seems to see a certain charm in him, too, even if it is a less seductive version.
目前欧元的构建者之一雅克•德洛尔称，自己创造单一货币的想法是好的，但是“实施的过程”有缺陷，因为较弱的国家举债过多。	Jacques Delors, one of the architects of the euro, now claims that his idea for a single currency was good, but that its “execution” was flawed, because the weaker countries were allowed to borrow too much.
事实上，对TTIP协定的支持大幅滑坡，以至于欧盟委员会主席容克要求领导人在本月的欧洲理事会上重申他们对该协定的承诺。	Support for the agreement has weakened so significantly, in fact, that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the deal at this month’s European Council.
安全部队袭击了和平的示威者，关押了反对派领袖，将数以千计的反对派投入可怕的集中营，诬陷独立的新闻记者犯有叛国罪 — — 此项罪名最高可以判处死刑。	Security forces attacked peaceful protesters, jailed opposition leaders, sent thousands of their supporters to gruesome detention camps, and accused independent journalists of treason – a crime punishable by death.
加总数据和微观粒子都印证了世界已变得紧密互联，跨境流在规模和复杂性上都有所增加，涉及的国家和参与者数量也有所扩大。	Both aggregate data and micro examples confirm that the world has become more tightly linked, with cross-border flows increasing in scope and complexity – and embracing a larger number of countries and participants within them.
伊斯兰堡—上个月，牛津大学格林坦普顿学院（GTC）在艾格洛夫公园（Egrove Park）召开了一年一度的新兴市场研讨会。	ISLAMABAD – Last month, Oxford University’s Green Templeton College held its annual Emerging Markets Symposium at Egrove Park.
它还支持基地组织的叙利亚分支沙姆征服阵线（Jabhat Fatah al-Sham，即前胜利阵线al-Nusra Front）的圣战分子。	Turkey also lent support to jihadists from al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (formerly the al-Nusra Front).
2008—2009年全球经济危机干扰但并未打断这一高速增长，直到2013年初，新兴经济体度过了一段反常的无危机的十年。	The global economic crisis of 2008-2009 disrupted, but did not derail, this rapid growth, and emerging economies enjoyed an unusually crisis-free decade until early 2013.
尤其是它能影响目前的“银行业联盟”计划，该计划需要三个要素：一个单一的监督机构、一个共同的决议机构以及一个可靠的存款保险系统。	In particular, it could affect current plans for a “banking union,” which needs three elements: a single supervisor, a common resolution authority, and a credible system of deposit insurance.
吉尔特·维尔德斯（Geert Wilders）的自由党（PVV）在5月15日的荷兰选举中令人意外地表现低迷，这似乎印证了这一点。	The unexpectedly weak performance of Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party (PVV) in the Dutch election on March 15 seems to suggest this.
发自伯克利 — — 美国总统唐纳德·特朗普和国会共和党人把对高收入者进行大幅减税列为高度优先事项，认为这种减税将刺激经济增长，创造就业机会，并借助因此增加的政府收入来维持运营。	BERKELEY – US President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have made large tax cuts for top earners a high priority, arguing that such cuts will stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and pay for themselves through increased revenues.

该使团希望能在阿萨德政权与反对派之间斡旋，令前者同意推行让后者满意的改革措施，但这样的时机（如果曾经存在过的话）其实早就一去不返了。	The time to try to broker a compromise, with Assad’s regime agreeing to reforms that would satisfy the opposition, is long gone (if it ever existed).
最近，2012年6月，欧盟领导人通过了《增长与就业契约 》 （ Compact for Growth and Jobs ） ， 计划动员1,200亿欧元资金。	More recently, in June 2012, EU leaders adopted a Compact for Growth and Jobs that was supposed to mobilize €120 billion.
毕竟，成功的经济发展 — — 如美国、德国、日本和中国 — — 取决于为生产性投资而创造的国内信用。	After all, successful economic development – in countries like the US, Germany, Japan, and China – has depended on domestic credit creation for productive investment.
人们应当咨询央行的意见，但其作用不应该是在不进行政治干预的情况下实现这些目标：也就是说我们要追求央行作为政策工具方面的独立性而非目标实现上的独立性。	The central bank should be consulted, but its role should be to implement the objective without political interference: independence in terms of policy tools, not goals.
他在伦敦的国家自由俱乐部中宣布了这个决定。 国家自由俱乐部是威廉·格莱斯顿和其他英国议会传统的忠实拥护者在19世纪成立的一个机构。	Indeed, he admitted as much in his speech at the launch of his political party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, from a safe distance of thousands of miles from an increasingly turbulent Pakistan.

莫斯科 — — 俄国总统德米特里·梅德韦杰夫面对联邦议会发表施政报告的时候，他的讲话似乎针对的是一个先进、繁荣的国家，而不是今天的俄罗斯，这着实令我感到惊讶。	MOSCOW – When Russian President Dmitri Medvedev delivered his annual address to the Federal Assembly I was struck by the fact that his speech seemed to be meant for an advanced, prosperous country, not the real Russia of today.
随后的关于特朗普的核心信念的热烈讨论 — — 也许他是个地下民主党，毕竟，他曾经资助过民主党候选人，并且同情民主党立场（比如堕胎问题 ） — —没有切中要害。	And the subsequent fevered discussions about Trump’s core beliefs – maybe he was a crypto-Democrat, who had, after all, donated to Democratic candidates at one time and sympathized with Democratic positions (such as on abortion) – missed the point.
由于阿拉伯温和人士普遍怀有矛盾的心态，因此我们还有机会孤立极端份子，逐步建立起为人们广泛参与的稳定政体。	Given ambivalence among Arab moderates, there remains a chance to isolate the extremists and gradually build stable polities with broader participation.
但如今，国际贸易落后于产出复苏（而产出复苏本身亦很平庸 ） ， 因为有利于全球化的全球政治秩序不再。	But it now lags behind the recovery of output (which is itself modest), because the kind of global political order hospitable to globalization is disappearing.
模仿李光耀的政府模式 — — 而不是它的讽刺漫画形象 — — 需要允许远超中共可容忍程度的民主制度。	To emulate Lee’s model of government – rather than its cartoon caricature – would require allowing a far more democratic system than the CCP would ever tolerate.
还有一点至关重要，那就是他们继续完善体制建设，为农村经济发展创造出有利的环境，实现从自耕农到企业家的转型。	It is also crucial that they continue to improve their systems to create an enabling environment for dynamic rural growth to transform subsistence farmers into entrepreneurs.
如果你在他们面前摆事实，比如说像这次听证会那样，他们就会变得好斗而不快 — — 好像一个个都是小号特朗普。	If you put the facts before them, as happened in that hearing, they become aggressive and unpleasant – sounding rather like smaller versions of Trump.
他习惯于通过推特直接向“民众”发布这些具有冒犯性的绰号，他把这样的沟通称之为“现代总统的”执政方式。	He is in the habit of tweeting these offensive epithets directly to “the people,” a type of communication he calls “modern day presidential.”
法国、爱尔兰、丹麦、荷兰、意大利和希腊等国多次公投结果因此得到逆转，即使其中涉及堕胎与离婚等有浓重感情色彩的内容。	That is how numerous referendum outcomes – in France, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, and Greece – have been reversed, even when deeply emotional issues, such as abortion and divorce, were involved.
今年的火灾是近20年来最大的，毁掉了三百万英亩土地，导致估计高达140亿美元的农业、森林、卫生、交通和旅游业相关损失。	This year’s fires are the largest in nearly 20 years, destroying three million hectares of land and causing an estimated $14 billion in losses related to agriculture, forest degradation, health, transportation, and tourism.
为了实现这一目标，大学应当升级其组织结构，避免明确划定院系界限，以创造一种跨艺术、科学、人文的连续统一体。	To that end, universities should update their organizational structure, moving away from clearly delineated departments in order to create a kind of continuum across the arts, humanities, and sciences.
但自从一位比利时外交部长（时任欧盟理��会主席）在1993年东盟会议上宣布“世界上只剩下两个超级强权，那就是美国和欧洲”之后，许多年都没有什么动静。	But it seems ages since a Belgian foreign minister (as chairman of the EU Council of Ministers) declared at an ASEAN meeting in Singapore in 1993: There are now only two superpowers left, the US and Europe!
由于工业化大国的债务 — — 如英国的和美国的 — — 都依靠外部融资，因此它们的政府总是可以将债务货币化也是站不住脚的。	Because the debts of the large industrial borrowers – the UK and the US – are externally financed, the argument that their governments can always monetize debt is not convincing.
欧洲经济共同体的成立形成了积极的经济效果，但与北美自由贸易区一样，它并没有削弱国家身份，也没有造成政治统一的氛围。	Establishing the EEC had favorable economic effects, but, like the North American Free Trade Area, it did not reduce national identification or create a sense of political unity.
尽管公众及其民意代表们早已见多识广，但银行家们为了一己私利而有计划有步骤地腐蚀这项全球市场基准指标 — — 还是以伦敦来命名首发 — — 存在基础的行为还是让前者大为震惊。	Despite all that had gone before, the public and their representatives were stunned to learn that bankers had systematically undermined the foundations of a global market benchmark – one with London in its name to boot – for personal gain.
加沙/耶路撒冷 — — 随着哈马斯和法塔赫在开罗会面举行第四轮民族团结谈判，不仅巴勒斯坦人、就连美国人和欧洲人也将密切关注谈判的进展。	GAZA/JERUSALEM – As representatives of Hamas and Fatah meet for the fourth round of national unity talks in Cairo, not only Palestinians but also Americans and Europeans will be watching closely.
正如我多年前在西班牙所做的那样，默克尔对独裁统治崩溃的反应是放弃物理投身公共服务，并最终使自己陷入了欧洲政治的漩涡之中。	Just as I had done in Spain a few years before, Merkel reacted to the collapse of the dictatorship she lived in by leaving physics to embrace public service. Eventually, she got caught up in the whirlwind of European politics.
再举一个非洲的例子。 20世纪60年代，尼日利亚东部决定脱离比夫拉（Biafra ） ， 而其他尼日利亚人拒绝答应，部分原因就在于比夫拉拥有尼日利亚石油储量的绝大部分。	To take another African example, when the people of eastern Nigeria decided to secede and form the state of Biafra in the 1960s, other Nigerians resisted, in part because Biafra included most of Nigeria’s oil.
对于一个尝试逐渐增加市场力量的中央计划经济而言，这样的具体但不完全的契约是无比宝贵的 — — 至少在一开始是这样。	For a centrally planned economy attempting to allocate more authority to the market, such contracts are invaluable – at least at first.
道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军的政府协助日本的自由人士恢复和完善战前的民主机构，而不是帮助老派的日本人恢复建立独裁系统。	Instead of helping Japanese of the old school restore an authoritarian system, General Douglas MacArthur’s administration helped Japanese liberals restore and improve their prewar democratic institutions.
金正日据闻死于心脏病突发，但此前已因癌症生命垂尾 — — 这无非是个花招，意在隐瞒兄长癌症病重期间金敬姬实质掌权的真相。	Kim Jong-il was said to have died suddenly of a heart attack, though he had been dying of cancer for some time – a subterfuge aimed at concealing Kim Kyong-hui’s de facto leadership during her brother’s cancer treatments.
因此它正在与债权人进行新一轮充满争吵、旷日持久的讨论 — — 最后的结果极有可能又是一个短期解决方案。	So yet another round of contentious and protracted discussions with its creditors is underway – one that may well produce yet another short-term solution.
最显著的变化是 ， “ 团结”工会的统一性质已经被社会分割所取代，对很多波兰人来讲，他们在很大程度上已经开始远离了政治和公众事业��	Most notably, the unifying character of Solidarity gave way to social divisions and, among many of Poland’s people, a large dose of alienation from both politics and civic engagements.
1856年出生在目前克罗地亚境内一个东正教塞尔维亚家庭，特斯拉的国籍到现在仍然是巴尔干地区争论的对象。	Born into an Orthodox Serbian family in 1856 in a town that is now part of Croatia, Tesla’s nationality remains an object of debate in the region.
事实上，HDP可能无法获得进入议会所需要的10%的支持率，这一结果将让AKP赢得足够大的多数，靠自己修订宪法。	Indeed, the HDP seemed at risk of failing to obtain the 10% of the vote it would need to enter parliament, an outcome that would have provided the AKP with a majority large enough to amend the constitution on its own.
特朗普的自恋、对曝光的渴望，以及对能够与前前总统奥巴马的诺贝尔和平奖相提并论的急切之心，便是金正恩所需要了解的一切。	Trump’s narcissism, hunger for the spotlight, and desperation to match former President Barack Obama’s Nobel Peace Prize are all that Kim needs to know about the man.
事实上，他的就职演说几乎全篇都在大谈政府在提供教育、对抗气候变化、重建基础设施、照顾穷人和残疾人以及一般化的未来投资方面的积极作用。	Indeed, he devoted almost the entire speech to the positive role of government in providing education, fighting climate change, rebuilding infrastructure, taking care of the poor and disabled, and generally investing in the future.
一个巨大的考验将会是看占总人口10%的、大多居住在帐篷里的10万流离失所的人是否有足够的安全感重回家园。	One big test will be whether the estimated 100,000 displaced people, amounting to 10% of the population, many living in tent camps, feel safe enough to return home.
新加坡的社交媒体创业企业Bubble Motion（最近更名为Bubbly）在最初两年就吸引了超过2，000万用户 — — 相当于Facebook或Twitter历史同期的近两倍之多。	Singapore’s social-media startup Bubble Motion (recently rebranded as Bubbly) generated more than 20 million users in its first two years – nearly double the number that Facebook or Twitter accrued in the same period in their history.
印度官员在公开场合对中印关系往往十分谨慎，并明智地希望双边贸易和投资有所增加，但他们的安全顾虑仍十分尖锐。	While Indian officials are often discreet in public about relations with China, and wisely want bilateral trade and investment to grow, their security concerns remain acute.
而它其实没有必要这样做：事后看来，我们似乎有理由假设如果中国人民银行能多一点耐心，2015年8月改革的成果就可能坚持下来。	And it didn’t have to: with the benefit of hindsight, it seems reasonable to assume that, had the PBOC simply been more patient, it could have stuck with the August 2015 reform.
类似地，尽管文件要求加强地方立法机构，但并没有拿出具体的计划限制地方政府在经济活动中的角色，而这是中国经济扭曲的来源之一。	Likewise, though the document calls for strengthening local legislatures, it proposes no concrete plan to curb local governments’ role in economic activities, which is one of the sources of distortions in the Chinese economy.
美国目前将国民生产总值的5 % ， 约合每年9000亿美元，用于军事相关开支（五角大楼、中情局、退伍军人及其他费用 ） 。	The US currently spends around 5% of GDP, or roughly $900 billion per year, on military-related spending (for the Pentagon, the CIA, veterans, and others).
相反，中国政府应该专注于其出于错误理由选择的行政长官所造成的问题，并且应该解决示威所反映的根本性治理问题。	Instead, it should focus on the problems created by the chief executives that it chose for the wrong reasons, and it should resolve the underlying governance problems that the demonstrations reflect.
如果巴勒斯坦人单方面宣布独立，然后某些国家不出所料地承认了这个新国家，那么以巴冲突的形式将发生戏剧化的转变。	If the Palestinians declared independence unilaterally, and if, as is expected, some sort of recognition by at least some states followed, the contours of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would change dramatically.
然而，在得到政府紧急融资、担保和低利率的支援后，许多银行又开始给高层管理者支付巨额的奖金，同时强烈地反对旨在限制他们冒险和补偿的改革。	But, buoyed by government bailout money, guarantees, and low interest rates, many banks have again begun to pay their top managers huge bonuses while fighting vigorously against reforms designed to restrain their risk-taking and compensation.
虽然基于市场的倡议是推动创新的重要因素，但在激活绿色金融、确保气候风险披露等工作需要政府和监管者更多地开展交流合作。	While market-based initiatives are important drivers of innovation, governments and regulators also have a crucial role to play in activating green finance and ensuring that climate risks are measured and reported accurately.
PayPal两次在纳斯达克上市、几乎在世界最大经济体经营了二十年，才积累了1.88亿活跃客户和2820亿美元的年支付额。	It took PayPal two NASDAQ listings and almost two decades operating in the world’s largest economy to reach 188 million active customers and $282 billion in annual payments.
为了弄清楚实际状况，国际贸易中心（ITC）不久前对东南亚民众如何管理野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约规定的蟒蛇贸易进行了研究。	To see what that looks like, the International Trade Center (ITC) recently examined how people in Southeast Asia sustainably manage the CITES-listed python trade.
对于受感染的个人来说这些费用包括治疗费和住院费用，从住所往返于医院诊所的交通费，误工时间，以及为防止更多的蚊子传播疾病而购置的灭蚊喷雾或蚊帐。	For an infected individual, those costs include treatment and hospital expenses, transportation to and from a health clinic or hospital, time spent out of work, and insect sprays or bed nets to protect against more disease-spreading mosquito bites.
但同样的油价变化在1973-4和1979-80的石油危机之后都有所发生。 在那两个时期，油价从最高峰回落之后却还保持了数年的高位，从而影响了股票市场、房屋市场和世界经济的成长。	But the same pattern followed the 1973-4 and 1979-80 oil crises, when prices dropped from their highest peaks, but stayed quite high for years, representing a drag on the stock market, the housing market, and the world economy.
在这一背景下，必须指出，尽管金正恩的和平提议是出于渴望重建饱受制裁摧残的朝鲜经济的动机，但改变一个惯于忍受极端艰难时期的国家的行为绝非仅靠制裁。	In this context, it is important to note that, while Kim’s peace overtures are motivated by a desire to rebuild North Korea’s sanctions-battered economy, sanctions alone did not change the behavior of a country long used to enduring extreme hardship.
要正确认识金融监管的细节，美国需要领导人拿出智慧、经验和韧性辨别正确的措施，推动立法，然后有效地执行。	To get the details of financial regulation right, the US needs leaders with the wisdom, experience, and perseverance to identify the right measures, push for their enactment, and then implement them effectively.
叙利亚的残酷战争已经夺去了250，000人的生命、导致2100万民众近半数流离失所，并驱使百万难民赴欧洲寻求庇护。	In Syria, a brutal war has already taken 250,000 lives, displaced half of the country’s 21 million people, and sent a million refugees to Europe seeking asylum.
该谈判本应在朝鲜负责对日关系正常化的大使宋日昊与负责释放羁押在朝日籍人士谈判的前政府大臣中井洽之间展开。	The negotiations were to be held between Song Il-ho, North Korea’s ambassador responsible for normalizing relations with Japan, and Hiroshi Nakai, a former minister who negotiates officially for the release of Japanese citizens abducted by the North.
但是，在19世纪40年代，由爱尔兰土豆饥荒导致的大量移民改变了马萨诸塞州的人口结构，民粹主义者控制了立法机构。	But, in the 1840’s, mass immigration, fueled by the Irish potato famine, altered the state’s demographic balance, enabling populists to gain control of the legislature.
即使英国拒绝这一安排，也不能阻止苏格兰这样做 — — 正如欧盟只能谴责但无法阻止黑山单方面使用欧元。	Even if the UK disapproved of the arrangement, it could not stop Scotland from adopting it – much as the European Union deplores but cannot stop Montenegro’s unilateral use of the euro.
在这里 ， “ 欧洲经济复苏计划”的推出 ， - 这是一个全欧盟范围的财政刺激方案，相当于1 .5％的国民生产总值，并在1 2月间得到了欧洲各国政府首脑的首肯-是向前迈进了一大步。	Here, the launch of the European Economic Recovery Plan – the initiative for an EU-wide fiscal stimulus equivalent to 1.5% of GDP, endorsed by the European Heads of Government in December – constitutes a major step forward.
如今，国际制裁正在令俄罗斯已然十分艰难的经济状况雪上加霜，克里姆林宫需要俄罗斯人民 — — 以及全世界 — — 承认这个现实。	At a time when international sanctions are exacerbating Russia’s already-grim economic conditions, the Kremlin needs to ensure that its people – and the world – recognize this reality.
这导致理论界陷入困境：这些政权并非主要依靠硬实力，也没有成功建立起软实力，但仍然能在国外发挥真实的影响。	Theorists are therefore in a bind: these regimes are not relying chiefly on hard power, are unsuccessful at generating soft power, but are still able to project real influence abroad.
这意味着不但中国、印度和巴西等主要新兴经济体代表力的增加，也意味着尼日利亚和印尼（两国人口之和超过四亿）等国家代表力的增加。	This means increasing representation not only for the major emerging economies, such as China, India, and Brazil, but also for countries like Nigeria and Indonesia, which together are home to more than 400 million people.
类似地，保守地假设有多少“真正的额外”资金通过海外援助和多边开发银行用于遏制气候变化将让这一数字有所缩小。	Similarly, conservative assumptions about how much “genuinely extra” money is being spent to fight climate change through overseas aid and the multilateral development banks might have produced a lower figure.
长期美国国债的低利率还提振了其他高收益长期资产的需求，包括股票、农地、高收益公司债券、黄金和房地产。	The low interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds has also boosted demand for other long-term assets that promise higher yields, including equities, farm land, high-yield corporate bonds, gold, and real estate.
而如今法国男性的预期寿命已近83岁，但实际退休年龄却为60岁低一点（虽说法定退休年龄是65岁，但实际上公共养老金可以更早地被提取 ） 。	Now, the effective retirement age in France is just below 60 (the official retirement age is 65, but in practice public pensions can be drawn much sooner), even though male life expectancy is nearly 83.
但如果这种代理谈判变成了直接会谈，而美国方面又不能亲身参与谈判的话，那就无法保证强大的一方不会去威吓弱小的一方。	If the proximity talks are replaced with direct talks in which the US is not physically inside the negotiating room, there is no guarantee that the stronger partner will not try to bully the weaker one.
所谓的八国集团为非正式团体，发起于 1975 年，由美国、欧洲四强 — — 英国、法国、德国和意大利、日本组成，后来又加上了加拿大。	What is now known as the G8 was launched in 1975 as an informal group of the United States, Europe’s Big Four – Britain, France, Germany, and Italy – and Japan, with Canada added as an afterthought.
当冲突无可避免地出现时，公众信心、政治信任和市场依赖都毫无意义地变成了的牺牲品¾俄国和乌克兰显然就属于这样的情况。	When the inevitable conflict occurs, public confidence, political credibility and market reliability are needlessly sacrificed – this has clearly occurred for Russia and for Ukraine.
亚洲集中了80%的世界灾难，但直接受灾难影响的亚洲人口数量在十年间下降了近十亿，原因就在于采取了印度洋海啸预警系统等措施。	In Asia, where 80% of the world’s disasters are concentrated, the number of people directly affected has dropped, decade-on-decade, by almost one billion, owing to measures like the Indian Ocean tsunami early-warning system.
这在1997-1998年的亚洲金融危机、2008年的全球金融危机和2010年的欧元区危机中都得到印证。	This pattern was evident in the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the eurozone crisis that erupted in 2010.
这些数字十分可观，而且相比治疗艾滋病所需的抗逆转录病毒药物，费用更是微不足道，后者每年的花费是200美元以上，而且必须每天服用，而不是每年一次。	These are impressive figures, and the expense is trivial compared to the anti-retroviral drugs needed to treat AIDS, which cost more than $200 annually and must be taken every day, not every year.
有必要回忆一下小布什总统也做出过类似的撕毁克林顿与朝鲜的“框架协议”的决定：金氏政权可以预测地立即开发出核弹。	It is worth recalling the outcome of President George W. Bush’s analogous decision to tear up Bill Clinton’s “framework agreement” with North Korea: the Kim regime promptly and predictably developed a nuclear bomb.
奥巴马因此提议在今年底终止2001和2003年对上述纳税人的减税政策，而对其他纳税人的减税政策都将继续执行下去。	That is why he is proposing that the 2001 and 2003 rate cuts for these taxpayers be allowed to expire at the end of the year, while the rate cuts for other taxpayers are extended.
但他的民粹主义其实是个假货：当班农在政治上为蓝领工人站台的时候，他手里的几百万美元却是靠当年在高盛集团任职以及对电视喜剧《宋飞正传（Seinfeld ） 》 的幸运投资赚来的。	But his was faux populism: while Bannon politically championed blue-collar workers, he lived on the millions he had attained from a stint at Goldman Sachs and through a fortunate investment in the TV comedy series “Seinfeld.”
即使在德国等表现最好的经济体，2008年以来的增长也变得非常缓慢，若是换作其他时期，只能用凄凉来形容。	In even the best-performing economies, such as Germany, growth since the 2008 crisis has been so slow that, in any other circumstance, it would be rated as dismal.
如果你像今秋的我一样去过美国或亚洲，那么欧洲的形象大概会有选择地更加光明一些：尽管欧洲仍被视为积极的模式，但已不再被看作全球行动者。	If one travels to America or Asia, as I did this autumn, Europe’s image becomes selectively brighter: while it continues to be perceived as a positive model, it is no longer considered a global actor.
由于发达国家至少在未来数年内都不得不将利率维持在极低水平，市场上存在很大的向高收益新兴经济体出口资本的激励。	Because interest rates must remain very low in developed countries at least for the next several years, there are now strong incentives to export capital to higher-yielding emerging economies.
鉴于经济表现扎实，加之中国人易于驯服，毫无疑问，胡锦涛二十一世纪的市场独裁将会在目前维持中共继续统治。	Given the economy’s solid performance and the docility of China’s population, there seems little doubt that Hu’s twenty-first-century market dictatorship will preserve the Party’s mandate to continue ruling – for now.
由于分离塑料费力费钱，因此最划算的办法通常是对少数商品热塑性塑料予以二级循环利用 — — 其中大部分是瓶子，其收集基础设施已经建成。	Given the difficulty and expense of separating plastics, the most economically viable option is often secondary recycling of a few commodity thermoplastics – mostly bottles, for which collection infrastructure is already in place.
更糟糕的是，它们有可能造成串联效应，比如传染病和导致金融或政治危机的网络袭击，给最脆弱人群带来最沉重的伤害。	Worse, they can have a cascading effect, with, say, a pandemic or cyber-attack provoking a financial or political crisis and imposing costs disproportionately on those who can least afford them.
科学家们甚至以“人类纪”来命名我们所处的时代，因为人类（希腊语词汇是“anthropos ” ） 正在对地球生态系统造成严重的影响。	Scientists have even given a name to our era, the Anthropocene, in which humanity (“anthropos” in Greek) is having a large-scale impact on the planet’s ecosystems.
布鲁塞尔－在讨论阿富汗问题时，许多报纸持续暗示一些欧洲的北约同盟国家在阿富汗表现不佳，这些国家要么不能要么不愿意作出更大的努力。	BRUSSELS – When discussing Afghanistan, many newspapers continue to suggest that some of Europe’s NATO allies are under-performing in Afghanistan, and are either unable or unwilling to make a greater effort.
对于特朗普，其目标似乎是系统性摧毁奥巴马总统的遗产，而这仅仅是为了兑现他的选举承诺（从某种意义上讲，他的选战从未结束 ） 。	In Trump’s case, the goal seems to be systematic deconstruction of President Barack Obama’s legacy, for no other reason than to be true to his electoral campaign (which, in a sense, has never ended).
关键不在于桑托勒姆的言论在事实上的对错，而是他所说的能使其追随者们“感觉”良好—因为这符合他们的偏见。	The point is not whether Santorum is right or wrong factually. What he says “feels” right to his followers, because it conforms to their prejudices.
首先，这些活动要比2014年的反对马杜罗的示威活动参与面更广、社会经济多样性更强。 2014年的示威活动的主要参与者是委内瑞拉中产阶级。	First, they are much broader and more socioeconomically diverse than the anti-Maduro protests in 2014, which seemed to comprise mostly middle-class Venezuelans.
未采取资本账户管制的土耳其央行期望通过用旨在遏制过度信用增长的国内宏观审慎工具为补充实现金融和价格稳定。	Without capital-account management, Turkey’s central bank expected to achieve financial and price stability by complementing the reduction in overnight rates with domestic macroprudential tools aimed at reducing excessive credit growth.
相比之下，古巴的新劳尔主义政治体系却取材于最纯粹的拉美军事专制传统中，只不过是以共产主义作为幌子而已。	By contrast, Cuba’s new Raúlist political structure takes its inspiration from the purest tradition of Latin American military caudillismo, using communist ideology pragmatically.
如果允许富人少纳税，国家修筑堤坝的资金就必然减少。 如果动用国民警卫队和物资储备在伊拉克打一场毫无希望的战争，就必然占用处理国内危机时所能动用的资源。	If it gives tax cuts to the rich, it will have less to spend on repairing levees; if it deploys the National Guard and reserves to fight a hopeless war in Iraq, there will be fewer resources at home to cope with a domestic crisis.
因此，非洲博客写手和在线活动家们必须更加紧密地与通讯企业的投资者和股东合作，说服他们力挺民主和人权，拒绝反自由的政府指令。	That is why Africa’s bloggers and online activists must work more closely with investors and shareholders of communications firms to convince them to stand up for democracy and human rights by resisting illiberal government directives.
他们认为，没有了英国的制肘，其实更容易推进一体化进程，因为剩余成员国之间的差异性较小，因此更可能协商一致，走出一些原本会遭到英国可能反对的步伐。	Without the UK, they argue, it will be easier to advance integration, as the remaining members are somewhat less heterogeneous, and therefore more likely to agree on steps that Britain might have opposed.
但如果这一方针失败 — — 不管是因为不正确的顺序还是因为群众不满暴增 — — 其他国家在放松管制、实现货币完全自由化时就会更加犹豫。	But if the approach falters – whether because of incorrect sequencing or a surge of popular dissatisfaction – other countries will become even more hesitant to lift controls and fully liberalize their currencies.
由于长期资产的真正价值很难预测，人们会自然而然地把注意力集中到观察价格的上涨比率，并仅仅由于价值的迅速提升而去关注这些资产。	Since the true value of long-term assets is so hard to estimate, it is human nature to focus on the rate of increase in their observed prices, and to allow one’s attention to become fixated on these assets just as their value is increasing very fast.
事实上，尽管就各国究竟在多大程度上吸取了过往教训方面还一直存在着不确定性，更别提各国之间的不一致性，但许多新兴经济体已经在较长时期内构筑了更加健全的基本面。	Indeed, despite enduring uncertainties over the degree to which they have absorbed the lessons of the past, not to mention inconsistencies across countries, many emerging economies have developed much sounder fundamentals over an extended period.
对于留欧派来说，在他们先前支持留在欧盟的时候没有提出争取EEA成员资格的理由是令人震惊的不负责任的行为。	For Remainers not to make the case for EEA membership, when they had previously been in favor of remaining in the EU, is an astonishing abdication of responsibility.
叙利亚民众太久以来一直为残酷和混乱所困；少有国家能给他们喘息的机会；他们被迫踏上极度危险的逃亡之旅。	Its people have been besieged by brutality and mayhem for far too long; they can find respite in far too few countries; and they are being forced to undertake journeys that are far too dangerous.
我们相信美国和俄罗斯的总统，加上其他拥有核武器的国家领袖，运用他们政治家的智慧和勇气，让我们摆脱核武器的阴影。	We trust that the US and Russian presidents, and leaders of all other nuclear powers, will show statesmanlike wisdom and courage and begin the process of freeing the world from the nuclear menace.
因此梁振英及其团队应该提出扩大选举委员会选基（electoral base ） 、 开放候选人提名程序的方案。	So Leung and his team should put forward proposals to broaden the electoral base of the election committee and open up the nominating process for candidates.
首先是埃沃·莫拉莱斯，一位Amayra印第安人，在社会主义运动的旗帜下，他有时被看做是玻利维亚第二个切•格瓦拉。	In first place is Evo Morales, an Amayra Indian running under the Movement Toward Socialism banner who is sometimes seen as Che Guevara’s second coming.
随后那些公关机器又被急速开动起来，宣传这些不相关的条款能使跨太平洋伙伴关系协议成为21世纪的“高质量”贸易协议，而实际上这只不过美国国内众多游说团体趁机敲竹杠的说辞而已。	The PR machine then went into overdrive by calling the inclusion of these extraneous conditions as making the TPP a “high-quality” trade agreement for the twenty-first century, when in fact it was a rip-off by several domestic lobbies.
仰光 - - 和中东地区一样，当今时代一个全球性的政治问题开始在缅甸浮出水面：应该如何从一个失败的独裁主义国家转向一个自立的多元主义国家？	RANGOON – Across the Middle East, and now in Burma (Myanmar), one of the great questions of contemporary global politics has resurfaced: How can countries move from a failing authoritarianism to some form of self-sustaining pluralism?
鲁伯特·默多克的儿子，新闻集团欧亚分部的主席和首席执行官詹姆斯·默多克批准秘密支付1亿英镑（约合1.6亿美元）的封口费给被窃听者。	James Murdoch, Rupert’s son and Chairman and Chief Executive of News Corporation’s European and Asian operations, authorized a secret payment of £1 million ($1.6 million) to buy the silence of hacking victims.
而当柯拉科夫斯基这位现代波兰最受人称道的哲学家迅速意识到，整个共产主义其实都是建立在谎言之上的时候，他只得惊恐的从中抽身。	Kolakowski, modern Poland’s most acclaimed philosopher, quickly learned that mendacity was the true building block of Communism, and he withdrew from it in horror.
安倍因此得以任用亲信操纵日本全国广播公司NHK董事会，此人公开宣扬军队妓院是彻头彻尾的私营企业，而南京大屠杀是外国的虚假宣传。	That is why Abe can get away with appointing cronies to the board of NHK, the national broadcasting company, who openly claim that the military brothels were an entirely private enterprise and that the Nanking Massacre was a foreign fabrication.
而民主作为一个整体概念也已经遭到了腐蚀和诋毁，与此同时，吞咽了许多穆斯林社会的极端主义却成功蔓延到了西方的移民社区当中。	The whole notion of democracy has been eroded and discredited, with the radicalization that engulfs many Muslim societies now spilling over into their emigrant communities in the West.
在试图以军事手段推翻哈马斯的选举胜利失败后，巴解组织与其伊斯兰教对手就国民和解问题达成了一致，但这份契约无异于废纸一张。	After having failed to reverse Hamas’s electoral victory by military means, the PLO agreed with its Islamist rivals on a plan for national reconciliation; but this pact remains a dead letter.
正如德国总理默克尔所指出的，尽管欧洲以占全世界7%的人口生产了25%的财富，但也占据了50%的全球福利支出。	As German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pointed out, though Europe is home to just 7% of the world’s population and produces 25% of the world’s wealth, it accounts for 50% of global welfare payments.
在这样的情况下，加强对科技行业的监管 — — 就像（比如）金融业那样 — — 已成为热门政策话题。 面对这样的担忧，领先科技公司股票市值下滑 — — 或者波动增加。	Stock-market values for leading tech companies are down – or perhaps just becoming more volatile – in the light of such concerns.
过去三十年来，现有的知识产权体制在知识的利用方面制造了越来越多的障碍，往往导致创新带来的社会回报与私人收益之间的差距不断扩大。	Over the last 30 years, the prevailing IP regime has erected more barriers to the use of knowledge, often causing the gap between the social returns to innovation and the private returns to widen.
如果竞技体育对成绩的狭隘关注限制了我们对冲浪美与和谐的体味，而因此硬要在冲浪时强行加入更多的转向恐怕就太遗憾了。	It would be highly regrettable if the competitive sport’s narrow focus on point-scoring were to limit our appreciation of the beauty and harmony we can experience riding a wave without fitting as many turns as possible into our time on it.
大约70年前，也就是大萧条时期，凯恩斯提出了他的失业理论。 这一理论讲述政府行为如何可以帮助恢复充分就业。	Some 70 years ago, during the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes formulated his theory of unemployment, which described how government action could help restore full employment.
但事实表明，中国海军在南海的活动越来越活跃，特别是在钓鱼岛和黄岩岛海域，在越南宣称拥有主权的南沙群岛也是如此。	But the fact is that China’s navy is becoming increasingly active in the South China Sea, at the Senkaku Islands and Scarborough Shoal in particular, but also around the Spratly Islands claimed by Vietnam.
在亚洲国家货币并不整体升值以及美国政策不变的情况下，可能只有大幅度经济衰退才会减少美国的整体经常项目赤字。	In the absence of a generalized appreciation of all Asian currencies and unchanged American policies, possibly only a deep recession could reduce the overall US current-account deficit.
在英国，英格兰银行已经宣布将在1月结束其抵押贷款融资换贷款计划（Funding for Lending Scheme ） — —该计划允许银行等出借方以超低利率获得融资来发放贷款。	In the UK, the Bank of England has announced that in February it will end its mortgage Funding for Lending Scheme, which allowed lenders to borrow at ultra-low rates in exchange for providing loans.
很小的短期利差有违于人们对即将到来的法国（以及意大利）的选举的关注，看上去选举结果隐含着切实的短期解体危险。	Small short-term spreads belie the focus on the forthcoming elections in France (and those in Italy), which supposedly imply a concrete short-run danger of a breakup.
企业愿意承担商务旅行的成本，这一事实表明，对于一些关键性任务，移动大脑要比将相关信息传递给大脑更加容易。	The fact that firms incur the cost of business travel suggests that, for some key tasks, it is easier to move brains than it is to move the relevant information to the brains.
根据国际移民组织（International Organization for Migration）的数据，截至7月，今年有大约150,000移民抵达欧洲，比2014年同期翻了一番。	According to the International Organization for Migration, as of July, some 150,000 migrants had reached Europe by sea this year, double the number during the same period in 2014.
对此态度更为审慎的人工智能发展联合会则成立了一个特别小组，专门研究其所谓的“计算机智能摆脱人类控制的潜在可能性 ” 。	The more cautious Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence has set up a special panel to study what it calls “the potential for loss of human control of computer-based intelligences.”
作为最大党，国大党成为新成立的联合进步联盟（United Progressive Alliance，UPA）的主导者。	As the largest party, Congress became the hub of the newly established United Progressive Alliance (UPA).
他们的想法非常简单：如果建立正确的激励机制，民众、政府和行业就能够保护和恢复热带雨林，而不是以开发的名义毁坏它。	The idea is simple: with the right incentives, people, governments, and industries will preserve and restore tropical forests, rather than plow them under.
在一次周日晨间脱口秀上，另一位共和党候选人、威斯康辛州州长斯科特·沃克尔（Scott Walker）称在加拿大边境建设一座边境墙是“一个我们看来相当合理的事项 ” 。	And on a Sunday morning talk show, another Republican candidate, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, described building a wall on the US-Canada border as “a legitimate issue for us to look at.”
但长崎 — — 更广义地说，也包括日本 — — 并不总是向世界开放，通过海洋与中国这样的近邻和美国这样的远邻连为一体。	But Nagasaki – and Japan, more broadly – has not always been open to the world, reaching across the ocean to connect with other countries, from near neighbors like China to faraway allies like the United States.
根据新古典主义经济学家的观点，答案是一个响亮的“是 ” ， 并且，在许多情况下，他们能够指出证实他们观点的重要证据。	According to neo-classical economists, the answer is a resounding “yes,” and, in many cases, they can point to substantial evidence to validate their claim.
但在几乎相同的时间，暴力也在委内瑞拉兴起，示威者开始死于政府代理人之手，美洲国家组织（Organization of American States，OAS）发声宣布 … … 它不会发声。	But when violence flared up – virtually simultaneously – in Venezuela and protesters began dying at the hands of government agents, the Organization of American States raised its voice to announce that...it would not raise its voice.
（克鲁格曼的立场有时被称为凯恩斯主义，但凯恩斯远比克鲁格曼清楚，我们不应该依赖机械的“需求乘数”来决定失业率。	(Krugman’s position is sometimes called Keynesianism, but John Maynard Keynes knew much better than Krugman that we should not depend on mechanistic “demand multipliers” to set the unemployment rate.)
他颇有争议地囚禁了军方高级将领伊尔克·巴斯布格（İlker Başbuğ ） 。 土耳其检方指控他意图颠覆政府 — — 尽管许多人认为这根本是无稽之谈。	Controversially, he has jailed the army’s top general, İlker Başbuğ, whom Turkish prosecutors have accused – many say implausibly – of plotting to overthrow the government.
在约旦，由捍卫记者自由中心（Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists）领导的联盟发起了一项新运动 — — “说话不是犯罪”以提高人们对媒体自由度下降的认识。	In Jordan, a coalition led by the Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists has launched a new campaign, “Talk is Not a Crime,” to raise awareness about declining media freedom.
随着各国变得日益富裕，非贸易服务构成了产出的更大份额，导致GDP增长快于贸易，同时全球产能过剩进一步遏制了贸易增长。	As countries become richer, non-traded services constitute a greater share of output, causing GDP to grow faster than trade, while global overcapacity has restrained trade growth further.
国际大赦组织记录了阻挡移民和难民越境进入希腊和保加利亚的普遍做法 — — 这种做法违反了国际法的原则。	Amnesty International has documented the widespread practice of pushing back migrants and refugees attempting to cross into Greece and Bulgaria – a practice that contravenes international law.
但不久之后美国总统小布什就发表了臭名昭著的“邪恶轴心”演讲，并将伊朗定义为为美国最危险的三大敌人之一 — — 这导致伊朗政策了发生逆转。	But US President George W. Bush’s notorious “axis of evil” speech – delivered just days later, and citing Iran as one of America’s three most dangerous enemies – spurred a reversal of Iranian policy.
但勒庞的两大竞争对手 — — 独立中间派候选人马克龙和中右翼共和党候选人菲永 — — 都支持开放和自由市场。	But Le Pen’s two main rivals – the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron and the center-right Republican François Fillon – both argue for more openness and freer markets.
这样的举动是中国的老习惯，美国必须促使中国人停止这种行为，明确告诉中国人这样的欺凌行为将破坏美中关系。	Such moves are an old habit for the Chinese, and the US must push them to break it, by making it clear that such bullying behavior will undermine China’s relationship with the US.
我们得出了一个结论，即至少经济的路径 — — 用失业、通胀和产出增长等常规宏观经济变量衡量 — — 不完全由总需求决定。	A conclusion we drew was that, at the very least, the path of an economy, measured by conventional macroeconomic variables of unemployment, inflation, and output growth, is not fully determined by aggregate demand.
在减少二氧化碳方面，太阳能电池和风力发电所需的面积还不到植树造林所需面积的1 ％ ， 而它们正变得越来越有效，它们往往可以被放在非生产用地上（如风力涡轮机可放在海上，太阳能电池板可放在沙漠里 ） 。	Solar cells and wind turbines require less than 1% of the area of forests to reduce CO2, they become increasingly efficient, and they can often be placed on non-productive land (such as wind turbines at sea and solar panels in deserts).
这样的话，汇率变动就会很小，而且只要在需要的时候才会有变动；汇率波动性会被遏制，这是因为不会再发生针锋相对的注入；投机行为也会减弱。	Exchange-rate movements would be minimal and only as intended, and volatility would be contained, because tit-for-tat injections would no longer occur and speculation would wane.
各项民意测验显示，支持“脱盟”运动的英国选民比例偏离幅度较大，从65%至35%都有，尤以未能完成高中，年逾 60 岁，或者从事“D、E类”蓝领工作的群体为高。	Opinion polls indicate that British voters back the “Leave”campaign by a wide margin, 65% to 35%, if they did not complete high school, are over 60, or have “D, E” blue-collar occupations.
如果对增加消费的新一轮强调能使中国储蓄相对GDP的比率下降5 % ， 那么中国依然会是全球储蓄率最高的国家，但这5%的下降将完全消灭中国的经常账户盈余。	If the new emphasis on increased consumption shrank China’s saving rate by 5% of its GDP, it would still have the world’s highest saving rate. But a five-percentage-point fall would completely eliminate China’s current-account surplus.
此书就世界是否会因为石油和其他自然资源短缺而面临严重的经济问题这一话题引发了国际性的辩论。 而18个月后欧佩克的石��减产似乎预示了这些问题的出现。	The book launched an international debate on whether the world would soon face immense economic problems due to shortages of oil and other natural resources - problems that seemed to be presaged by OPEC's production cuts eighteen months later.
与20世纪30年代真正的孤立主义者（他们激烈反对在二战期间援助英国）相比，所有这些总统都是坚定的国际主义者。	All of them were strong internationalists when compared to the true isolationists of the 1930s, who bitterly opposed coming to the aid of Britain in WWII.
自2006年创立以来，全球移民和发展论坛（Global Forum on Migration and Development）为各国以及其他利益攸关者之间关于移民和发展事务的对话提供了急需的平台。	Since its inception in 2006, the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) has provided a much-needed platform for dialogue among states and other stakeholders on issues related to migration and development.
最重要的是，要想让公司董事会 — — 以及为公司和个人提供咨询的律师、银行家和会计师 — — 严格对待法律和道德合规性问题，必须让它们相信它们将因为自己的行为而被问责。	Most important, if corporate boards – and the lawyers, bankers, and accountants who advise companies and individuals – are to be vigilant about legal and ethical compliance, they must believe that they will be held accountable for their actions.
事实上，中国电子商务的爆炸式增长表明了一条通往生机勃勃的新消费文化的捷径，这条捷径，今天的发达经济体处于相近发展阶段时是可望而不可及的。	Indeed, the explosive growth of Chinese e-commerce points to a shortcut toward a newly vibrant consumer culture that was unavailable to today’s advanced economies at a similar stage of development.
他所领导的政党在这三个州的胜利（没有任何政治专家或民调机构成功预测到这样的结果）其实也是他个人的胜利，他还巩固了国会在推动反对派在即将到来的大选中扮演击败人民党的关键角色。	His party’s victory in all three states (which no political pundit or polling organization had predicted) was a personal triumph and consolidated Congress as the lynchpin of the opposition’s drive to defeat the BJP in the coming general election.
法国作为欧盟轮值主席国在改善各成员国之间应对金融危机的协调度方面作了大量的工作。 而欧洲委员会也已经开始发挥更积极的作用（响应“欧洲之友”在10月10号的呼吁 ） 。	France’s EU Presidency has done much to improve coordination between member states’ responses to the financial crisis, and the European Commission has also begun to play the more active role that Friends of Europe called for on October 10.
其中一位难民告诉我，尽管在登陆希腊莱兹伯斯岛（Lesbos）的过程中经历了千辛万苦，但在整个艰难的旅程中，他们只有一次感到恐慌：当他们的手机没有信号的时候。	Despite all that they had endured, one of them told me, upon landing on the Greek island of Lesbos, that they had panicked only once during that perilous voyage: when their mobile phone signal disappeared.
第三，正如以往一样，只要有人敢于批评以色列对哈马斯火箭袭击反应过度及其对巴勒斯坦人的集体惩罚，以色列都指责为反犹主义。	Third, as usual, Israel has accused of anti-Semitism those who have dared to criticize its disproportionate response to Hamas’s indefensible rocket attacks and its collective punishment of Palestinians.
这就是美国科技企业高管（脸书的COO）谢丽尔·桑德伯格（Sheryl Sandberg）最近所暗示的状况，当时她建议将全面避免脸书进行数据收集的选项列为“付费产品 ” 。	This is what the US tech executive Sheryl Sandberg was hinting at recently, when she suggested that a full-blown opt-out from data collection on Facebook would be a “paid product.”
自从1973年加入欧盟以来，爱尔兰一直是欧盟援助的主要受益方。 2007年，它仍然从欧盟财政预算中净得五亿欧元。	Ireland has been a major beneficiary of EU subvention since joining in 1973, and, in 2007, it was still receiving a net total of €500 million from the EU budget.
目前，大部分人工智能决策由全球北方做出，较不发达国家的关注点没有得到强调，也让技术的两用（dual-use）变得更加困难。	At the moment, most AI policymaking occurs in the Global North, which deemphasizes the concerns of less developed countries and makes it harder to govern dual-use technologies.
但是，就更为全球化的范围而言，这好像是“老欧洲”决定现在是拨乱反正、证明自己比世界上的新兴力量更为富有活力的时候了。	More globally, however, it is as if “Old Europe” had decided that it was time to set the record straight and prove more dynamic than the world’s emerging forces.
我们在针对多个经济体样本的分析中发现，非金融企业在2010至2014年间以美元计价的债务平均增加达40 ％ ； 在2007至2015年期间，他们的偿债比率也飙升至40 ％ 。	Across a sample of these economies, non-financial corporations’ dollar-denominated debt rose by 40%, on average, from 2010 to 2014; from 2007 to 2015, their debt-service ratios also soared by 40%.
美国剑桥—诺贝尔经济学奖获得者保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）曾讽刺说 ， “ 加拿大其实与美国比与它自己更接近 。 ”	CAMBRIDGE – The Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman once quipped that “Canada is essentially closer to the United States than it is to itself.”
海南省政府并没有明确列出具体哪些将构成“非法”活动，但很多人担心这项命令将全权委托海警干涉中国南海的商业活动。	What constitutes “illegal” activity in the eyes of the Hainan authorities was not spelled out, but many worry that the order will give carte blanche to the maritime police to interfere with commercial activity in the South China Sea.
发自圣保罗 — — 毒品战争已经迷失了自己的方向，而2011年也是时候抛弃这个折磨人的做法，转而推动一系列与公共卫生，人权和常识有关的新政策。	SAO PAULO – The war on drugs is a lost war, and 2011 is the time to move away from a punitive approach in order to pursue a new set of policies based on public health, human rights, and common sense.
但是，让罗马峰会成为这样的场合所需要的诚实的、自觉的、明确的愿景对于欧盟领导人来说并不是理所当然，他们擅长漂亮的言辞远甚于务实的方案。	But the honesty, self-awareness, and clear vision needed to use the Rome summit in this way does not come naturally to EU leaders, who excel far more at lofty rhetoric than pragmatic solutions.
尽管有慷慨的税收减免激励，但韩国财阀仍对这场实验相当冷漠，至少有部分原因在于交通和通信问题迟迟得不到解决。	Despite generous tax incentives, South Korea’s huge conglomerates, the chaebol, have spurned the experiment, at least partly because of enduring transportation and communications problems.
如今，联盟党党魁、内政部长马特奥·萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）要求其他欧盟国家 — — 特别是法国 — — 接受更多寻求庇护者。	And now Matteo Salvini, the League party leader and Minister of the Interior, is demanding that other EU countries – particularly France – accept more asylum seekers.
我们长期关注的问题是捕渔应该具有选择性。 渔民的目的在于收获利润最大的鱼种和该鱼种中利润最大的个体。	The long-term concern is that fishing is intended to be selective; fishermen aim to harvest the most profitable species and the most profitable sizes within species.
危急之下务实的技术官僚一度掌握了权力，但随后油价的翻倍上涨则显示俄罗斯的经济危机已暂时过去，于是“斯洛维奇”们又卷土重来了。	The pragmatic technocrats took over, but the subsequent doubling of oil prices signals that the danger for Russia’s economy is over for now, so the siloviki are resuming command.
我们需要类似于澳大利亚慈善机构NPS MedicineWise所引入的方案。 NPS MedicineWise举办了一次增加公众抗生素用途知识的视频竞赛。	We need campaigns like the one introduced by the Australian charity NPS MedicineWise, which held a competition for videos promoting public awareness of antibiotic use.
今年早些时候，中国新规定了两个全国纪念日以纪念漫长的抗日战争：9月3日为“抗日战争胜利纪念日 ” ； 12月13日为“南京大屠杀死难者国家公祭日 ” 。	Last year, China introduced two new national memorial days to commemorate China’s long battle against Japanese aggression in World War II: “War against Japanese Aggression Victory Day” on September 3 and “Nanjing Massacre Day” on December 13.
一旦计算机能够以语义精确度来处理自然语言，高质量的信息将不再需要在流行以后才能到达最终用户那儿，这就不同于如今的搜索引擎所需要的条件了。	Once computers can handle natural languages with semantic precision, high-quality information will not need to become popular before it reaches the end user, unlike what is required by Web search today.
说到底，重大变革能否成为现实应该取决于央行干预是否实际加剧了当前危机，就像它在20世纪30年代所做的那样。	Ultimately, whether significant changes are warranted should depend on whether the central bank's interventions in fact aggravated the recent crisis, as they aggravated the crisis of the 1930s.
尽管前总统密特朗的第二家庭几乎完全是国家机密，只有一小撮精英知道，媒体也配合地帮忙隐瞒，但他的情人和他们的女儿仍参加了他的葬礼。	Though former President François Mitterrand’s second family was virtually a state secret, known only to a select elite and hidden from the public by a reverential press, his mistress and their daughter attended his funeral.
今年夏天，世卫组织为实现这一目标迈出了重要的一步，向所有男同性恋及男同性性行为群体推荐PrEP，从而成为首家采取上述措施的重要国际卫生机构。	This summer, the World Health Organization took an important step to that end, recommending PrEP for all gay men and men who have sex with men, making it the first major international health organization to do so.
我希望东西双方能致力于提出一个能产生更多长期效果的正式战略，而不仅仅是那些在危机时共同承诺的拯救计划。	I wanted East and West to commit to a formal strategy to deliver more enduring results than those promised by the rescue packages that we were putting together at the time.
至少它将为政治家们的行动带来条理性，而那些反对这种欧洲新平衡的探索的人 — — 大部分都是马克思主义者和民粹主义者 — — 将必须找到理由去说服他们自己。	At the very least, it would bring a sense of coherence to the actions of politicians, and those opposed to this search for a new European equilibrium – mostly Marxists and populists – would need to compete with a new vision of their own.
一个原因是在大部分上市公司中，股东都是消极投资者，他们向足够地了解企业以决定是买入还出卖出；他们并不像卷入企业决策中。	One reason is that in most publicly traded corporations, shareholders are passive investors who just want to know enough about the firm to decide whether to buy or sell; they do not want to get involved in decisions.
但《2014评估》清楚地表明，我们的伙伴期望在未来看到更加活跃 — — 甚至更加坚挺 — — 的德国外交政策。	Yet it is abundantly clear from the Review that our partners expect a more active – and even more robust – German foreign policy in the future.
如果所有人都吃掉欧盟公民平均水平的肉食，那么80%的世界适耕土地都得用来生产饲料，而目前的比例为33 % 。	If every human ate as much meat as the average EU citizen, 80% of the world’s arable land would have to be dedicated to producing it, compared to 33% currently.
2017年，他对十月革命百年纪念只字不提，而在此四年前，他发起了规模宏大的罗曼诺夫王朝400周年纪念。	Four years before famously shunning the centenary of the Russian Revolution in 2017, he sponsored lavish celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the House of Romanov.
当然，伊斯兰教武装有其自身的独特性，但领袖肉体消灭和组织生存之间的关系等等重要特点与其他某些武装组织相通。	Armed Islamism has its particularities, of course, but it also shares important characteristics with some of these groups, including the relationship between the physical elimination of a leader and organizational survival.
一开始是一个旨在降低贸易关税的直接计划，后来演化为一个拥有6亿消费者、直接与世界最大经济体竞争的生产基地的有活力的开放市场的蓝图。	What began as a straightforward push to reduce trade tariffs has evolved into a blueprint for a dynamic open market of 600 million consumers and a production base that can compete directly with the world’s largest economies.
发自纽约 — — 当经济是否正迸发“新芽”的讨论在美国国内不绝于耳之时，在许多国家，特别是那些发展中国家的形势却在不断恶化。	NEW YORK – While discussions about economic “green shoots” continue unabated in the United States, in many countries, and especially in the developing world, matters are getting worse.
因此，自相矛盾的是，英国尽管反对“深化”欧洲联合，恰恰给土耳其提供奥地利以及安格拉·默克尔所支持的“特殊伙伴关系 ” 。	Paradoxically, then, what the British, with their opposition to “deepening” European integration, are really offering the Turks is precisely the sort of “privileged partnership” that Austria, together with Angela Merkel, has been backing.
前佛罗里达州州长杰布·布什和新泽西州州长克里斯·克里斯蒂等“体制内 ” （ 即得到共和党领袖支持的）候选人能否赢得选民的欢心只有在爱荷华和新罕布什尔州投票后才会明朗。	Whether an “establishment” figure – one backed by the party leadership, such as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie – can catch on with voters will become clearer only after Iowa and New Hampshire have voted.
尽管如此，欧元区还是可以从韩国身上学到经验，后者当年以任何人都没想到的速度走出了危机，实现了明智的改革和快速复苏。	Nevertheless, the eurozone could learn from the experience of South Korea, which came through its crisis more quickly than anyone expected, combining sensible reforms with a rapid recovery.
国家的迅速进步被归因于制造业出口的强势，而带来制造业强势的企业只有在正负激励的帮助下才有能力在全球市场上竞争。	The country’s rapid progress is attributed to strong manufacturing exports, carried out by firms that were able to compete in global markets only with the help of government incentives.
尽管具体的目标发生了变化，但最重要的信念 — — 随着文化、教育和制度因素随技术和工业动态而趋同，科学知识改变人类生活 — — 依然坚挺。	While specific objectives have changed, the overarching belief that scientific knowledge transforms people’s lives – as cultural, educational, and institutional factors converge with technological and industrial dynamics – has remained strong.
第二组是所谓“精英控制组 ” ， 该组可以在不接受任何治疗的情况下携带艾滋病毒长达10年以上而不发病。	The second group are “elite controllers,” who can carry HIV for ten years or more without treatment and without falling ill.
比如，智利铜矿被迫启开始使用脱盐水来进行开采作业，瑞典的Boliden公司42%的能源需求用可再生资源满足。	In Chile, for example, copper mines have been forced to start using desalinated water for extraction, while Sweden’s Boliden sources up to 42% of its energy needs from renewables.
在2008年金融危机前的十年中，独立央行制定的通胀目标是2 % ， 这样做是为了为经济提供物价稳定之“锚 ” 。	"In the ten years prior to the 2008 financial crisis, independent central banks set an inflation target of about 2%, in order to provide economies with a price-stability “anchor."""
特拉维夫—以色列长期占领巴勒斯坦领土正在给其国际地位造成不可挽回的伤害 — — 或者传统智慧这样认为。	TEL AVIV – Israel’s persistent occupation of Palestinian lands is irreparably damaging its international standing – or so the conventional wisdom goes.
这句歌词正是今天墨西哥人的真实感受：正常的民主、可靠的医疗卫生体系、可信的政府都已远去，不见了家乡，只剩下危机重重。	That’s how it feels to live in Mexico nowadays: far from democratic normalcy; far from a health system that inspires confidence; far from a government that builds trust; far from home and close to everything that imperils it.
维穆拉是一位“达利特 ” （ Dalit ） ， 即曾经的“贱民 ” ， 属于印度教种姓制度的最底层。	Vemula was a Dalit – a member of what was once known as the “untouchables,” at the bottom of the Hindu caste system.
最积极的解释认为，马克龙已经决心要以深度果断的改革为重点，而在宏观经济问题上准备谨慎推进，一如其前任萨科齐和奥朗德。	The most positive interpretation assumes that Macron has decided to focus on deep and courageous reforms, while approaching macroeconomic issues with caution, much like his predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and Hollande.
阿布扎比峰会提供了明确的2018年计划 — — 这一战略将对其他努力形成补充，提高麻疹、肺炎和冠状病毒等疾病的免疫覆盖率。	And the summit in Abu Dhabi has provided a clear plan to get there by 2018 – a strategy that complements other efforts to raise immunization coverage for diseases such as measles, pneumonia, and rotavirus.
世界各地物理学家和我自己都在研究大爆炸后一微秒希格斯粒子可能产生的作用 — — 这或许可以解释宇宙的形状和命运。	My own research, along with that of physicists around the world, has focused on what effects Higgs particles might have had just fractions of a second after the big bang – effects that could explain the shape and fate of the universe.
与此同时，在非洲，世界银行为尼日利亚提供了3.5亿美元农村电气化贷款，国际太阳能联盟（International Solar Alliance）预计也将落实20亿美元印度信贷支持非洲项目，包括迷你电网。	In Africa, meanwhile, the World Bank has loaned Nigeria $350 million for rural electrification, while the International Solar Alliance is expected to secure a $2 billion line of credit from India to support projects in Africa, including mini-grids.
除了不可靠的政府资助之外，俄罗斯以及乌克兰大部分地区的减轻危害项目都缺乏一个基本工具：鸦片类物质替代物。	Aside from shaky funding, the harm-reduction efforts in Russia, and to a large degree in Ukraine, lack a fundamental tool: opiate-substitution treatment.
只有当以色列认真地想通过协议寻求和平，而不是想通过法令向它的邻居强加安全，它才能成为为黎巴嫩及其周边地区带来稳定的国际社会努力的伙伴。	Only an Israel seriously willing to seek security through agreement, not one that wants to impose her security on her neighborhood by fiat, can be partner to an international effort to bring stability to Lebanon and beyond.
但这一观点忽视了体育成功对国民士气带来的效应，而这是一国在其他更“严肃”的领域取得成功��无形因素。	But that argument ignores the effect of sporting success on national morale, an intangible factor in a country’s success in other, more “serious,” spheres of endeavor.
换句话说，卢旺达之所以能以如此快的速度取得如此大的成就，是因为我们投资于最贫困人群，从而获得了更高的回报率。	In other words, Rwanda has achieved so much so fast because we are enjoying higher rates of return by investing in the poorest.
这些风险可能反过来恶化土耳其国内动荡，而与此同时，执政的正义与发展党（Justice and Development Party）面临着保持群众支持的难题。	These risks could in turn exacerbate internal discord in the country at a time when the ruling Justice and Development Party is struggling to retain popular support.
在他的畅销书《人神：未来简史 》 （ Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow）中，历史学家尤瓦尔·诺亚·赫拉利（Yuval Noah Harari）预见到“数据主义”的诞生，即在算法的祭坛上牺牲个人自由意志。	In his bestselling book Homo Deus, the historian Yuval Noah Harari anticipates the advent of “dataism,” whereby personal free will is sacrificed at the altar of the algorithm.
随着针对父母的，基于所谓被压抑和被恢复的受虐记忆的指控的减少，那些针对诸如天主教会等大型机构的投诉却增加了。	While complaints against parents, based on allegedly repressed and recovered memories of abuse, have declined, those against large institutions, such as the Catholic Church, have increased.
在过去60年中只有少数几个国家完全赶上的发达国家的生活水平，而这些国家都是依靠出口导向型增长并通过制造业提高生产力和创造就业。	Only a handful of economies over the last 60 years have fully caught up to advanced-economy living standards, and all relied on export-led growth to drive productivity and job creation in manufacturing.
如果日本在1990年发行该股份的话，当年的名义GDP总量为443万亿日元，因此给投资者的分红则为443日元。	If the Japanese government had issued trills in 1990, when Japan’s nominal GDP was ¥443 trillion, the dividend paid to investors the first year would have been ¥443.
完全依靠产品商业号召力的企业能够放心引入的创新非常有限，因为如果某种产品在市场上遭遇失败，他们可能活不到下一个创新诞生的时刻。	Companies that depend solely on their products’ commercial appeal are limited in the kinds of innovations that they can safely introduce, because if one of their products fails in the marketplace, they may not survive to build another one.
因此停止并逆转全球海洋环境破坏之势需要改善治理机制，必须通过改善后的机制强化经济可行性和创新性解决方案。	So stopping and reversing the degradation of the world’s oceans requires improved governance mechanisms, which must be used to enforce economically sensible and innovative solutions.
萨科齐总统的外貌及其身体语言 — — 如果他是莎士比亚笔下的一个角色的话，他可能是《奥赛罗》中的反面人物伊阿古 — — 也是问题的一部分。	The president’s physical appearance and his body language – if he was a Shakespeare character, he would probably be the traitor Iago in Othello – are part of the problem.
这是好消息 — — 不仅仅对阿根廷是如此，因为阿根廷所发生的事情间更影响到其他国家的思维和行为，特别是巴西。	This is good news – and not just for Argentina, because what happens there will affect thinking and behavior elsewhere, particularly in Brazil.
这种状况会助长社会两极化，从而导致政治不稳定、社会陷入僵局或作出短视决策，从而为经济表现带来严重的长期后果。	This fuels social polarization, which can lead to political instability, gridlock, or short-sighted decision-making, with serious long-term consequences for economic performance.
让我们共同盼望发达国家的反自由化浪潮能够在蔓延到世界其他国家之前得到有效的遏制，避免最终带来我们都不希望看到的后果。	Let us hope that the de-liberalization seen in developed countries can be checked before it spreads to other parts of the world and ultimately brings undesirable consequences for all.
一些特朗皮的顾问试图向他解释，在一个因为发行世界主要储备货币而获益良多的经济中，贸易赤字为何是有用的。	Some of Trumpi’s advisers try to explain to him how trade deficits work in an economy that benefits enormously from having the world’s leading reserve currency.
最新的核武器和远程导弹测试 — — 包括上个月进行的朝鲜历史上最强力的核试验 — — 表明这个隐秘王国距离实现目标已经非常接近。	Recent tests of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles – including the country’s most powerful nuclear test ever, carried out last month – show just how close the Hermit Kingdom is to achieving its goals.
基于这一可能性，瓦鲁法基斯也许认为，他提出的将初级盈余从GDP的4%削减到1 % （ 而不是直接减到零）已是对其他欧盟财政部长的慷慨赏赐。	Given this possibility, Varoufakis may have believed that he was making other EU finance ministers a generous offer by proposing to cut the primary surplus from 4% to 1% of GDP, rather than all the way to zero.
悲观者认为更多的人意味着更少的食物，上升的资源需求意味着枯竭和战争，而近几十年来，扩张的产能意味着更多的污染和全球变暖。	Pessimists see a world where more people means less food, where rising demand for resources means depletion and war, and, in recent decades, where boosting production capacity means more pollution and global warming.
他们仍对普京从俄罗斯公司首席执行官向以意识形态为后盾、排除万难重塑祖国影响力的国家领袖的转变不知所措。	They remain overwhelmed by Putin’s transformation from CEO of Russia, Inc., into an ideology-fueled national leader who will stop at nothing to restore his country’s influence.
这不是因为它们愿意扮演这一角色，而是因为如若央行想要给出人们所盼望的更高增长、更多就业创造的结果，一个很重要的方面是提高资产价格。	This is not because they wish to play that role; rather, it is because higher asset prices are essential if central bankers stand any chance of delivering the desired economic outcomes of higher growth and stronger job creation.
12,000多人申请加入尼日利亚教育计划（Teach For Nigeria ） 。 这是一个全国性组织，招募和培训年轻教师，然后分配到急需他们的学校。	More than 12,000 people have applied to join Teach For Nigeria, a national organization that recruits, trains, and places young teachers in high-need schools.
对于在今年保持发达经济体增长来说，这已经足够；不幸的是，对于发达经济体人民 — — 以及全球经济 — — 所急需的更快的增长来说，这还不够。	That will be enough to keep the advanced economies growing this year; unfortunately, it will not be enough to attain the faster growth that their citizens’ wellbeing – and that of the global economy – urgently requires.
联合国难民事务高级专员署预测， 南奥塞梯的危机所造成的大约十二万七千名流离失所者中的七万三千人可能会在初冬返回其原住地。	The UN High Commission for Refugees forecasts that 73,000 of the roughly 127,000 IDPs created by the South Ossetian crisis will probably return to their place of origin by early winter.
比如，美国联邦政府通过九个不同机构开办着47种职业培训项目，每年需耗资200亿美元，据政府问责办公室的观点，其中绝大部分项目效率低下、经营不善。	For example, America’s federal government has 47 separate job-training programs in nine different agencies, costing almost $20 billion a year, most of which the Government Accountability Office reckons are ineffective or poorly run.
我们的访问还表明某些决策者仍盲目认为性别盲点具有积极意义：他们认为不考虑政策可能产生的性别影响有助于在更大程度上营造性别平等的氛围。	Our interviews also suggest that some policymakers still regard gender-blindness positively: not thinking about the possible gender-specific effects of policies, they believe, contributes to an atmosphere of greater gender equality.
事实上，日本相扑圈着越来越受到公众厌恶，以至于许多日本人开始怀疑这个国家在经历了20年的停滞之后，究竟有没有能力去净化自己。	Indeed, Japanese Sumo circles are now facing growing public infamy, causing many Japanese to wonder if the country, after 20 years of stagnation, is capable of purifying itself.
具体到瑞典，俄罗斯特工被控将假消息注入瑞典的社交媒体，而且因为这些消息含有一定的真实成分，之后就会被瑞典人自己分享。	In Sweden’s case, Russian agents are accused of feeding false narratives into the Swedish social-media mill, which, because they contain grains of truth, are then shared by Swedes themselves.
这一冲突将迫使西半球其他国家表明立场并有可能威胁其经济和国家安全利益。 它们力图避免这一争斗与其自身息息相关。	The hemisphere’s other nations have a direct stake in attempting to pre-empt a fight that would force them to take sides and might threaten their economic and national-security interests.
但有位在全国影响力不断攀升的民主党政治新星，参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦却拿出了一系列提案，极大挑战了上述观点。	But a serious challenge to all of these views has now emerged, in proposals by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a rising Democratic star who has become increasingly prominent at the national level.
珠三角大湾区的另一大主要资产是深圳，它是一个充满创新精神的“经济特区 ” ， 以活跃的资本市场和民营经济成为中国创新创业及融入全球供应链的试验田。	Another major asset is Shenzhen, a highly innovative “special economic zone” boasting a dynamic capital market and a tradition of experimentation with private-sector-driven job creation and integration into global supply chains.
尽管自欧洲货币联盟启动以来经济增长较为平稳，但人均GDP—可能是衡量经济成功的最佳指标—却显示欧洲落于其他地区，即便是统计数据由于劳动力规模的原因进行了调整之后依然如此。	While growth has been reasonably stable since EMU started, per capita GDP – probably the best measure of economic success available – shows that Europe has lagged other regions, even when the figures are adjusted for workforce size.
确实，民主党的计划(如果可以被称为计划的话)无视伊朗持续颠覆伊拉克国家机关，而伊拉克变得足够强大可以抵制这些阴谋前，这一颠覆还将继续。	Indeed, the Democratic plan (if it can be called one) ignores Iran’s ongoing subversion of Iraq’s state institutions, which will continue unless and until they become strong enough to resist such machinations.
这一方法来自我们的伊斯兰教。 伊斯兰教呼吁和平、崇尚生活、注重尊严、促进人类发展，教导我们与人为善。	This approach arises from our Islamic religion, which calls for peace, honors life, values dignity, promotes human development, and directs us to do good to others.
如今，与伊斯兰国的战斗已经进入尾声，美国似乎不再热情地支持我们，这让土耳其可以肆意向我们发射导弹和火箭而不会受到任何惩罚。	Now that the fight against ISIS is winding down, the US seems less eager to support us, which has allowed Turkey to fire missiles and artillery at us with impunity.
与此同时，墨西哥的媒体也变得比从前更自由，更优秀也更加强势 — — 即便他们的报道质量偶然也会让人大跌眼镜。	Meanwhile, Mexico’s media are freer, better, and stronger than ever, even if on occasion the quality of their output leaves much to be desired.
另有五个国家退回到残酷的独裁统治（包括乌兹别克斯坦、阿尔及利亚、土库曼斯坦和白俄罗斯 ） ， 而其他国家都在过渡期的某个阶段陷入停滞之中。	Five relapsed into brutal dictatorships (including Uzbekistan, Algeria, Turkmenistan, and Belarus), while the rest were stuck somewhere in transition.
在另一条tweet上，特朗普质问，在美国向台湾出售价值数十亿美元的武器的情况下，为什么他不能和台湾进行元首级别的互动。	In another tweet, Trump asked why he shouldn’t engage with Taiwan at the presidential level when the US is selling Taiwan billions of dollars worth of weapons.
相反，在他们所浪费掉的时间里，债务会进一步增加，不但削弱债务人的短期前景，还将阻止对于未来增长至关重要的新资本和投资的流入。	On the contrary, during the time they waste, the debt grows heavier, not only weakening the debtor’s short-term prospects, but also discouraging inflows of new capital and investments that are critical to future growth.
面对右翼分子要求更疯狂削减开支的叫嚣，那些谨慎胆小不敢增加公共支出的政治家至少会理智地忽略这些意见。	In the face of clamor from the right to cut even more savagely, statesmen who are too timid to increase public spending would be wise to ignore their advice.
第三个选项，即让有潜在威胁的国家获得核武器，是基于这样的假设：一国政府愿意使用核武器保护自己的国家（乃至其他国家 ） 。	The third option, acquisition of nuclear armaments by potentially threatened countries, was based on the assumption that a government would be willing to use such weapons to defend its own country, if not another one.
每个调查委员会的成立都发生在某次惊人的权力滥用事件后，它们建议“采取必要措施”对隐私权进行保护；而每一次，最后退缩的都是政府。	Each one, established after some egregious abuse, has recommended that “steps be taken” to protect privacy; and each time, the government has backed down.
这一问题可以通过多种方法解决，首先是要有更加灵活的职场政策、平价育儿服务，并扩大技能培训，特别是在STEM领域（科学、技术、工程和数学 ） 。	This problem can be addressed in a number of ways, starting with more flexible workplace policies, affordable childcare, and expanded skills training, particularly in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
而在本月初，特朗普表示任何来自朝鲜的威胁“都将遭遇前所未有的怒火与打击 ” ， 对此朝鲜领导人金正恩则以威胁袭击关岛的方式作出回应。	Earlier this month, when Trump said that any North Korean threat “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,” North Korean leader Kim Jong-un responded by threatening to attack Guam.
但是，阿卜杜勒-加里尔没有指明具体的外国势力，也未提供任何证据来支持其指控。 这听起来特别像是卡扎菲频繁地高声痛斥“帝国主义-犹太复国主义者阴谋 。 ”	But Abdel-Jalil named no specific foreign powers and offered no proof to support his allegations, which sounded much like Qaddafi’s frequent rants against “imperialist-Zionist plots.”
针对两种最常见病毒的HPV疫苗可以预防70%的病例，但前提是接种疫苗的少女还没有感染上HPV病毒。 这也就是说必须赶在发生性行为之前为她们接种疫苗。	HPV vaccines can prevent 70% of these cases by targeting the two most common types of the virus, but only if girls have not yet been exposed to the virus, which means vaccinating them before they become sexually active.
例如，当我们说美国的生活方式需要五个地球的时候，我们假设技术发展是停滞不前的，然而，全世界范围内的土地使用效率很可能将会大大提高。	For example, when we talk about American lifestyles needing five planets, we assume that technology is frozen, whereas it is likely that worldwide land-use productivity will increase dramatically.
随后尼泊尔各方达成结束冲突的和平协议，毛主义者进入临时国会和政府并承诺选举制宪会议成员，尼泊尔国王被迫将权力交还给政党。	The king was compelled to hand power back to the political parties, while a peace agreement emerged that ended the conflict, bringing the Maoists into an interim parliament and government and promising elections to a Constituent Assembly.
苏维埃帝国的继承者们做梦也没有想到他们的未来竟是成为西方的“小字辈 ” ， 成为西方更贫穷，并充满悔悟和羡慕的伙伴。	The inheritors of the Soviet empire never anticipated that their future was to become the West’s “junior,” poorer, repentant, and admiring partner.
在大部分时候的大部分国家，通胀都应该维持在极低水平，央行也应该通过稳定的长期目标锚定通胀预期，尽管如此，将目标改为名义GDP的替代方案也值得考虑。	In most countries, at most times, inflation should be kept very low – and central banks should anchor inflation expectations with a stable long-term target, although the alternative of targeting nominal GDP deserves to be discussed.
墨尔本 — — 对利比亚进行国际军事干预不是为了靠轰炸实现民主，也不是为了拿到穆阿迈尔·卡扎菲上校的人头 — — 更不是为了压制油价或谋取暴利。	MELBOURNE – The international military intervention in Libya is not about bombing for democracy or for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s head – let alone keeping oil prices down or profits up.
但在现实中，一切照旧将会被气候变化的现实后果所打破，不受控制的温度变暖将阻碍甚至逆转亚洲近期的经济进步。	Yet, in reality, it is business as usual that would be disrupted by the consequences of climate change, with unfettered warming impeding or even reversing Asia’s recent economic progress.
对于极左翼来说则更加困难，至少在法国是如此，因为他们得将对移民的传统自由主义观点与贸易保护主义经济政策结合在一起，而第二项政策看起来跟民粹主义右派所拥护的并无二致。	This will be more difficult for the far left, at least in France, which combines traditionally liberal views on immigration with protectionist economic policies that look at lot like those espoused by the populist right.
1955年，加菲尔德创建了科学文献索引（Science Citation Index，SCI ） ， 该数据库包括了名望最高的科学期刊中的所有被引用文献，构成了一张连接文献的庞大的网络。	In 1955, Garfield created the Science Citation Index (SCI), a database containing all of the cited references across the most highly respected scientific journals, thereby capturing the sprawling web of connections among texts.
他取消了几十年来政府对贸易、投资和开办企业的无效限制，开创了印度历史上从未有过的10多年的快速经济发展。	He dismantled decades of inefficient and ineffective government restraints on trade, investment, and entrepreneurship, unleashing more than a decade of the fastest economic growth in India's history.
通过广泛应用价格低廉的新技术，各国终于可以摆脱石油市场不可避免的波动，朝实现长期能源安全的目标迈出坚实的一步。	By taking advantage of new technologies, now widely available at affordable prices, countries can finally move toward long-term energy security and away from the inherent volatility of oil markets.
首先，一些有能力发展核武器的国家认为 — — 一些国家甚至是在启动核计划后这样认为 — — 这不会增加安全。	First, several countries capable of developing nuclear weapons concluded – in some cases, even after launching programs – that to do so would not increase their security.
梅希望她的承诺能够赢得欧洲领导人 — — 特别是最大的预算贡献者德国，以及主要预算受益者波兰和葡萄牙。	May hoped that her promise would win over European leaders – especially the biggest contributor, Germany, and the big net recipients, such as Poland and Portugal.
但是，他实施了一项在到期时替换日本银行资产负债表上的政府债券，同时不断增加央行账目上的政府债券数量的政策。	Nonetheless, he has initiated a policy of replacing the government bonds on the BOJ’s balance sheet once they mature, while constantly increasing the volume of government debt on the central bank’s books.
事实上，今天的科学家面临着极其激烈的资金和重磅成果发布竞争压力，这把他们的目标与他们所服务���大众的目标割裂开来。	Indeed, scientists today are engaged in a hypercompetitive race for funding and prestigious publications that has disconnected their goals from those of the public that they serve.
改变性别不平等需要我们明确上述偏见在哪里、为什么和怎样付诸实施，并制定系统的战略和干预措施来加以铲除。	Tackling gender inequality will require us to identify where, how, and why these biases materialize, and to develop systematic strategies and interventions to root them out.
另一个值得关注的倡议是香港证券交易所为排放衍生物提供交易平台的探索性项目，该项目很可能将传统排放物以及碳都包括在内。	Another initiative worth watching is the Hong Kong stock exchange’s exploratory project to offer a trading platform for emissions derivatives, which will most likely include conventional pollutants as well as carbon.
华沙 — — 20年前的夏天，从波罗的海塔林到亚得里亚海蒂拉纳的共产主义统治全线瓦解，迎来了自由选举、市场改革和蓬勃发展的公民自由。	WARSAW – It was two decades ago this summer that communist rule began to implode from Tallinn in the Baltic to Tirana in the Adriatic, ushering in free elections, market reforms, and expanded civil liberties.
大多数俄罗斯人不把欧洲逼迫他们国家的边界当作是经过许久最终完全回归自己所属的文明的标志，而把它视为不安全之源。	Most Russians do not regard Europe’s approach to their country’s borders as a sign that they have, at long last, fully united with the civilization of which they are a part, but as a source of insecurity.
因此，更有可能的是叙利亚的分崩离析导致一战后（或奥斯曼帝国后）的中东国家体系 — — 亦称“赛克斯-皮科 ” （ Sykes-Picot）体系 — — 陷入危机。	As a result, it is much more likely that Syria’s disintegration would call the entire post-World War I (or post-Ottoman) Middle Eastern state system – also called the “Sykes-Picot” system – into question.
比如 两位世界级的大慈善家，乔治·索罗斯 (George Soros) 和莫· 易卜拉辛 （ Mo Ibrahim ） 。	Consider the cases of two of the world’s biggest philanthropists, George Soros and Mo Ibrahim.
现实是，从绝对值衡量，美国经济和军事实力仍然无比强大，还拥有 — — 并且在可预见的未来继续拥有 — — 比任何竞争对手都要多得多的盟国、友邦和影响力。	The reality is that, in absolute terms, US economic and military power is still enormous, and that it has – and will have for the foreseeable future – far more allies, friends, and influence than any of its competitors.
随着中国城镇人口比例从1980年的20%增长到2016年的56 % — —到2030年极有可能达到70 % — —这绝不是一件小事。	With the urban share of China’s population rising from less than 20% in 1980 to more than 56% in 2016 – and most likely headed to 70% by 2030 – this is no trivial consideration.
如果要收到预期的效果，伴随着量化宽松政策的不应仅有政府恢复受损贷款渠道（特别是那些针对中小规模的企业）的努力，还有对银行贷款的具体目标。	To have the desired effect, QE should have been accompanied not only by official efforts to restore impaired lending channels (especially those directed at small- and medium-size enterprises), but also by specific lending targets for banks.
但事实上，削减对于未来的投资 — — 无论涉及人、地球、政治机构还是企业 — — 都是非常不理性的行为。	In fact, cutting investment in our future – be it in people, the planet, political institutions, or business – is deeply irrational.
对这些信息的分析了解可用于提高牛奶产量，帮助农民每年每头牛增收420美元，让每年的总收益增加50 ％ 。	Insights from this information are then used to improve milk production, helping farmers earn an extra $420 per cow each year, and increase overall profits by 50% annually.
伊朗伊斯兰共和国建立以来，一直都是弱势总统制度，最终的权力属于最高领导人，首先是霍梅尼，现在是哈梅内伊。	Since its inception, the Islamic Republic has had a weak presidency; ultimate authority rests with the Supreme Leader, first Ayatollah Khomeini and now Ayatollah Khamenei.
而与1991年在美国领导的海湾战争之后所召开的马德里会议不同，这次的会议是在公认美国在伊拉克的努力失败的情况下召开的。	The difference now is that, unlike the Madrid Conference after the 1991 American-led Gulf War, the current effort is coming after a perceived American defeat in Iraq.
而那些宣扬民族主义以及反欧洲的右翼民粹主义者看似独来独往，但似乎也很希望在欧洲层面相互扶持，利用互相之间在大多数问题（特别是移民，文化认同和贸易）上的共同立场来获利。	Right-wing populists, as nationalist and anti-European as they may be, also seem eager to support one another at the European level, taking advantage of their common platforms on most issues, particularly immigration, cultural identity, and trade.
此后，乌克兰、利比亚和伊拉克要么自愿，要么迫于压力放弃了核武器计划，结果是乌克兰被俄罗斯入侵，伊拉克被美国入侵，利比亚被美国及其一些欧洲盟友入侵。	More recently, Ukraine, Libya, and Iraq all gave up their nuclear weapons programs either voluntarily or under pressure. Subsequently, Ukraine was invaded by Russia, Iraq by the US, and Libya by the US and several of its European partners.
前印度驻阿富汗大使卡特居（Vivek Katju）信心满满地认为，阿富汗总统卡尔扎伊对塔利班卡塔尔策略的愤怒将长期推迟谈判。	India’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Vivek Katju, is confident that Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s anger at the Taliban’s gambit in Qatar will not delay negotiations for long.
这一反应的反穆斯林要素将成为中东宗教极端分子的“燃料 ” ， 因为这似乎确认了他们关于宗教和文明冲突不可避免的叙事。	Anti-Muslim elements of that reaction would become fodder for religious extremists in the Middle East, by seeming to confirm their narrative of inevitable religious and civilizational conflict.
袭击者提出了明确的要求：肯尼亚必须把两年前部署在索马里的军队（作为将青年军赶出索马里的国际行动的一部分）撤出索马里，把索马里还给政府，恢复正常生活的表象。	The attackers issued a clear demand: Kenya must withdraw the forces that it deployed two years ago as part of an international effort to drive al-Shabaab out of Somalia and return the country to government rule and a semblance of normal life.
单看数字显然有点吓人：中国的债务相对GDP比率当前约为250 ％ ， 私人部门债务则相当于GDP的210％左右。	The figures are certainly daunting: China’s debt-to-GDP ratio now stands at about 250%, with private-sector debt amounting to about 210% of GDP.
乌克兰俄语公民都亲眼目睹了由克里姆林宫导演策划支持自治运动以及由此引发的经济萧条和流血冲突，希望他们能够意识到他们正在被普京所利用。	It is to be hoped that Ukraine’s Russian-speaking citizens, having witnessed the economic despair – and sometimes the bloodshed – caused by the Kremlin’s manufactured pro-autonomy movements, will realize that they are being turned into Putin’s pawns.
难民接收国已经精疲力竭，因此，毫不奇怪，不管生活在难民营还是赤贫社区，难民的生活条件十分困难，得不到生活便利设施和卫生设施。	With host countries overstretched, it is unsurprising that refugees live in rough conditions, whether in camps or very poor neighborhoods, with no amenities or sanitation.
如今，你只要简单地点击一下某个应用（app ） ， 就能把钱汇到国家 — — 甚至世界 — — 的另一头。	Today, money can be sent to the other side of a country – or the world – simply by tapping an app, without ever interacting with a traditional financial-services company.
事实上，从2000到2004年，净政府开支额的增长占了收入增长的150 ％ ， 而其它的收入来源枯竭了。	Indeed, from 2000 to 2004, the increase in net government expenditures accounted for 150% of income growth, as other sources of income shriveled up.
在东亚，北朝鲜借核武器不扩散条约掩饰它的核武器计划后从该条约中退出，中国、美国、日本、俄罗斯和韩国正力图说服金正日政权改变该计划。	In East Asia, North Korea withdrew from the NPT after using it to disguise its weapons program, and China, America, Japan, Russia, and South Korea are trying to persuade Kim Jong Il’s regime to reverse course.
同时，我们可以期待一个成长中的大西洋共同体，因为后续的贸易自由化谈判使在欧盟和美国之间发展一个自由贸易区更加容易。	At the same time, we can expect a growing Atlantic community as successive rounds of trade liberalization make it easier to develop a free-trade area between the EU and the United States.
此外，随着土耳其经济增长势头的减弱，其政府立场的强硬，以及其外交表现日益令人失望，许多土耳其人如今公开质疑形势。	And, with their country’s economic growth faltering, its government hardening, and its diplomatic performance a source of growing disappointment, many Turks now openly wonder what happened.
1984年， 在马格丽特·撒切尔的力争下，英国得到了对其净财政派款的巨额减免。 这一额度今年达到了50亿欧元。	In 1984, Margaret Thatcher demanded and got a large rebate in the British net contribution, which this year is worth roughly €5bn.
至少一定水平的风险 — — 不管是来自人为失误或制度弱点，还是来自地震、飓风和其他各种原因 — — 是所有基础设施投资所固有的。	At least some level of risk – whether stemming from human error and institutional weakness, or from earthquakes, hurricanes, and countless other sources – is inherent in all infrastructure investments.
“日本参与亚洲安全的意愿 ， ” 美国前国防部长阿什·卡特（Ash Carter）最近说 ， “ 让它成为地区内日益重要的行动方 。 ”	“Japan’s willingness to participate in Asian security,” former US Defense Secretary Ash Carter recently said, “makes it an increasingly important player in the region.”
投资者一直都担心2015年的股灾会重演 — — 当时市场的动荡引发了政府出手干预，股价大幅下跌以及几次交易暂停。	And investors are wary of a repeat of 2015, when market turbulence led to government intervention, sharply falling prices, and several trading halts.
美国联邦储蓄系统（成立于1914年）是在1907年金融大危机之后建立的。 在这些例子中，央行是金融精英的一种工具这一怀疑也同样显而易见。	In these cases, too, there was an obvious suspicion that the central bank was a tool of the financial elite.
布基纳法索农业将以家庭所有的农场和高效率农业企业为基础，将保证所有公民都能获得维持健康、活跃的生命所需要的食物 。 ”	It will be founded on family-owned farms and efficient agricultural businesses, and will guarantee [that] all citizens have access to the food they need to lead healthy, active lives.”
博科圣地的主要目标是迫使尼日利亚接受伊斯兰教法，自2009年因军方处决其领袖尤素夫（Mohammed Yusuf）而向政府宣战以来，该组织表现出极强的韧性。	Boko Haram, whose primary objective is to compel Nigeria to adopt Sharia law, has proved surprisingly resilient since declaring war on the government in 2009, in response to the military’s execution of its leader, Mohammed Yusuf.
当局清除这些问题，也宣布了新的“以人为本”城镇化计划。 这一新型城镇化将更高效、更包容、更环境可持续。	The authorities are aware of these issues and have announced plans for a new, “people-oriented” urbanization model that would be more efficient, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable.
简言之，公众、媒体以及（特别是）决策者必须提高科学素养，这是识别并拒绝抹黑科学和科学家的无理行为的关键。	Simply put, a higher level of science literacy among the public, the media, and especially among policymakers is essential to recognizing and rejecting unreasoned attempts to discredit science and scientists.
此外，据美国能源部的最新报告，风能和太阳能行业就业数量光是在2016年就分别增加了32%和25 % 。	In addition, according to a recent US Department of Energy report, the number of jobs in the wind and solar industries increased by 32% and 25%, respectively, in 2016 alone.
因此，在不劳而获的福利 — — 在新国家定居的前几年所获得的税收和缴纳金融资的福利 — — 问题上，包容原则应该让位给母国原则。	Hence, in the case of unearned welfare benefits, tax-financed benefits, and contribution-financed benefits granted during the first years in the new country of residence – the inclusion principle should give way to the home country principle.
直到最近，普京与贝隆夫人的相似之处还不那么明显（尽管定期的肉毒杆菌抗皱纹治疗让前者看上去像经过防腐处理的后者 ） 。	Until recently, Putin’s resemblance to Evita was not so obvious (though his regular Botox treatments have given him the look that she took on after she was embalmed).
北朝鲜现在成了第九个拥有核武器的国家，在它前面是联合国安理会的五个常任理事国、以色列、印度和巴基斯坦。	North Korea is now the ninth state with nuclear weapons, joining the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Israel, India, and Pakistan.
由于显然缺乏一个精神中枢系统，它已经变成了一个机能紊乱的肌体，连普通的国家利益都无法实现，在维护国际利益方面更是乏善可陈。	Seemingly lacking a central nervous system, it has become a dysfunctional creature with little capacity to recognize any common national, much less international, interest.
在面临患者对标准疗法不见效果的情况下，医生可能会想到使用再利用的药物，但常常缺乏足够数据做出依据充分的决定。	After encountering patients who don’t respond to standard courses of treatment, doctors may want to dispense a repositioned drug, but often don’t have enough data to make an informed decision.
但10月28日，联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey）致信国会，宣布他要重启对克林顿在担任国务卿期间使用私人电子邮件服务器的调查。	But on October 28, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress announcing that he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State.
此外，一项最近的研究比较了手术切除前列腺患者和只接受观察的患者的治疗结果，结果发现两组患者的存活率并没有区别。	In addition, a recent study comparing outcomes for patients whose prostate gland was surgically removed to those for patients who underwent only observation found no differences in survival rates between the two groups.
一场更大规模的贸易战将会对美国制造和农业企业产生巨大的负面影响，而现在看来这种贸易战爆发的几率越来越高。	A larger-scale trade war (or wars), with a significant negative impact on US manufacturing and agriculture, appears ever more likely.
对可靠能源的全球性需求就像输送能源的全球性网络一样将我们紧密地联系在一起，如果某个环节出现了错误，将不可避免地影响到网络中的每一个人。	Our global need for energy reliability binds us together as surely as the global network that delivers it; a failure in one part of our network will inevitably affect everyone.
许多人主张，任何形式的补贴都不应当予以支持，部分原因是即使不再需要它们，取消这些补贴即使不是不可能的话，也是极为困难的事情。	Many argue that subsidies of any kind should never be countenanced, in part because they are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to abolish, even if they are no longer needed.
12年前，哈塔米和外交部长哈拉齐是“前去购物”而不是出席亚洲协会的一次文化活动，以避免与美国国务卿奥尔布赖特照面甚至握手。	Back then, Khatami and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi “went shopping,” rather than attend a cultural event at the Asia Society and risk crossing paths – and shaking hands – with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
但是，在追求融合的过程中，欧洲人应该认识到，他们的亚洲战略 — — 目前集中于商业，而对法治精神和人权的关注较少 — — 必须增加一个安全维度。	But, in pursuing such harmonization, Europeans should recognize that their Asia strategy – which has so far focused on commerce and, to a lesser degree, on the rule of law and human rights – will have to take on a security dimension.
潘基文的全球可持续发展委员会（Global Sustainability Panel，GSP）发布了一份新报告，列出了一个可持续发展框架。	The Secretary-General’s Global Sustainability Panel has issued a new report that outlines a framework for sustainable development.
两个令我最担心的问题是我们可能无法筹集所需的资金支持卫生和发展项目，以及我们不能齐心协力向明确目标努力，帮助最穷人群。	The two that worry me the most are the possibility that we will be unable to raise the funds needed to pay for health and development projects, and that we will fail to align around clear goals to help the poorest.
该报告由以前在高盛公司任职的财政部长汉克·保尔森所领头的多个部门共同编写。 这份报告辩解说，更严厉的管制是错误的，因为全球经济应对系统性风险的最好防御办法是投资对冲基金或与对冲基金相关的每一个人都运用常识和“尽职 ” 。	Greater regulation would be a mistake, the report argues, because the global economy’s best defense against systemic risk is the exercise of common sense and “due diligence” by each and every person who invests or interacts with hedge funds.
政治理论家亚查·芒克（Yascha Mounk）在其重要新著《人民与民主 》 （ The People vs. Democracy）中将这类体制 — — 它们与反自由民主构成了恰当的对称 — — “反民主自由 ” 。	In his new and important book The People vs. Democracy, the political theorist Yascha Mounk calls this type of regime– in apt symmetry with illiberal democracy – “undemocratic liberalism”.
相反，心理学研究无一例外地表明人们并不只是看重他们的绝对收入，也看重他们在社会金字塔上的位置以及这一位置是否公平。	On the contrary, psychological studies invariably show that people care not only about their absolute income, but also about where they stand in the social pyramid and whether their position is fair.
一代人之前，他们的观点应该是完全可以接受的，即使主流未必如此，生气勃勃的孟加拉（以及印度西孟加拉西部的）知识分子文化也必然可以接受。	A generation ago, their views would have been considered perfectly acceptable, if not mainstream, in the vibrant intellectual culture of Bengal (the Western portion of which is the Indian state of West Bengal).
最近的例子是德国，在经历了激烈的争论后，新的性别比要求，从2016年开始，大公司非执行董事席位的30%必须是女性。	The latest example can be found in Germany, where, after much debate, new quotas require that from 2016 large companies fill 30% of non-executive board seats with women.
相反，发展石化或钢铁厂，或将低薪钻石切割岗位从印度或越南转移到博茨瓦纳 — — 后者比前两者富裕四倍 — — 是不可想象的，也具有很大的制约性。	By contrast, developing petrochemical or steel plants, or moving low-wage diamond-cutting jobs from India or Vietnam to Botswana – a country that is more than four times richer – is as unimaginative as it is constricting.
其中的两者 — — 页岩能源和大数据分析学 — — 建立在不断的技术突破上，而技术突破主要取决于私人部门行为，而不是宏观经济和结构性政策，美国在这方面领先优势明显。	Two of these – shale energy and big-data analytics – build on ongoing technological breakthroughs in which the US has a strong lead and depend primarily on private-sector action, not macroeconomic or structural policies.
但Stratton Oakmont的贪得无厌绝非华尔街的特例，我问我的一位好友、在SEC工作了20年的监管者，欺诈到了什么程度，他告诉我 ： “ 我发现这是普遍现象。	But Stratton Oakmont’s peculations were hardly an exception on Wall Street. As a good friend, who was an SEC regulator for 20 years, told me when I asked about the extent of fraud, “I found it to be pervasive.
而如果拥有14亿人口的中国能维持过去二十年的经济轨迹，那么瑞士可能得在小沙伊得克兴建一个更大的新火车站。	And if China, with its population of 1.4 billion people, maintains its economic trajectory of the last 20 years, the Swiss will probably have to build a new, much larger station at Kleine Scheidegg.
俄罗斯邻国可以自由加入北约，这一状况的唯一自然结果只能是带来一条压迫俄罗斯联邦西面和南面边境的新的分割线。	With Russia’s neighbors free to join the alliance, the natural result could only be a new dividing line, one pressing up against the Russian Federation’s western and southern borders.
但不管在毛泽东当权期间曾犯下多少不可饶恕的错误，他的绝对权力带给中国的是一种共同的目的和团结，以及共同的艰苦奋斗精神。	But, whatever Mao’s terrible failings, during his years of absolute power there was a sense of common purpose and solidarity that went with shared hardship.
他们坚持认为美国经济在2007年增速会放缓，但是其实这种增速放缓已经发生了而它对美国经济和欧洲经济都影响甚微。	They are bracing for a 2007 US growth slowdown that already has taken place with little consequence for both the US and European economies.
更重要的是，这将让关于欧盟成员资格的真正的成本与收益的争论合法化，有可能促成关于政府退欧计划的第二次全民公投。	More important, it would legitimize a new political debate in Britain about the true costs and benefits of EU membership, possibly leading to a second referendum on the government’s Brexit plans.
但美国共和党却一直在寻求降低富人的税收，理据是通过降低边际税率来促进投资、就业和经济增长，从而实现财富向社会其他阶层“滴涓”渗透。	But US Republicans have long pushed to lower taxes on the rich, arguing that lowering marginal tax rates will promote investment, employment, and economic growth, which will cause the wealth to “trickle down” to the rest of society.
药物遗传学癌症药物赫赛汀的研究试验原始实验对象芭芭拉·布拉德菲尔德（Barbara Bradfield）因该药而情况稳定地生活了20多年。	Barbara Bradfield, one of the original subjects in research trials for the pharmacogenetic cancer drug Herceptin, has now been stable on the drug for more than 20 years.

比如，欧盟委员会无权建议欧洲议会增税和实施财政转移支付，因为任何与税收相关的决定都需要所有28个成员国的一致同意。	The Commission cannot, for example, propose to the parliament that it raise taxes and finance transfers, because any decision regarding taxation requires the unanimous agreement of all 28 member states.
或者像在德国一样，他们应敦促中左及中右翼党派大联盟在欧洲范围内变得更积极主动、更注重投资，这既是为了经济合理发展，也是为了打击极右翼民族主义者。	Or, as in Germany, they should urge the grand coalition of center-left and center-right parties to become much more dynamic and investment-oriented at European scale, both for the sake of economic good sense and to combat far-right nationalists.

创新产业和服务业的崛起帮助中国超越其作为世界工厂的角色。 在阿里巴巴和腾讯等互联网平台企业的推动下，中国已经开始发展自身的物联网行业。	Increased innovation and the rise of the services sector have helped China move beyond its role as the world’s factory to develop its own version of the Internet of Things, driven by platform companies like Alibaba and Tencent.
拉各斯/斯德哥尔摩 — — 在加纳，一群有创意的妇女和年轻人正在用竹子这种不太可能的材料来制造自行车。	LAGOS/STOCKHOLM – In Ghana, a group of enterprising women and young people is building bicycles out of an unlikely material: bamboo.
如果结局是被美国抛弃（如果不是背叛的话 ） ， 为什么还要在美国的压力下重启与以色列的最新正式对话？	Why resume, under US pressure, a nearly normal dialogue with Israel if the outcome is to be abandoned, if not betrayed, by American policy?
但无价可循的环境外部性 — — 比如全球变暖和缺水 — — 必须引起严重关注，采取具有远见卓识的应对措施。	But the un-priced environmental externalities – global warming and water depletion, for example – will require serious attention, not myopic, reactive mindsets and approaches.

从事生产者日益减少，坐等分配者却与日俱增，以至于整个经济肌体逐渐腐烂，最终社会将其他人创造的财富全都消耗殆尽。	Economic rot sets in as the ranks of dependent citizens grow, productive citizens dwindle in number, and society eventually runs out of other people’s money.

2003年伊拉克战争是一个重要事件，它加剧了该地区最重要国家之一的逊尼派-什叶派冲突，结果是该地区其他许多分裂社会的这一冲突也纷纷抬头。	The 2003 Iraq war was highly consequential, for it exacerbated Sunni-Shia tensions in one of the region’s most important countries and, as a result, in many of the region’s other divided societies.
根据某些解释，特朗普的煽动为其首席战略顾问斯蒂芬·班农服务，班农坚持即将打响的文明之战会出现不那么光明的未来。	On some interpretations, Trump’s demagogy is in the service of his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, who defends a dark vision of a coming war of civilizations.

这与许多其他成员国持有的观点不同，包括法国和德国，它们将欧盟单一市场视为通向更深层次一体化的垫脚石，而不是终点。	This contrasts sharply with the vision upheld by many other EU members, including core countries like France and Germany, which view the EU’s single market as a stepping stone toward deeper integration, not an end in itself.
祖马的青年时代是在放牧中度过的，他直到和曼德拉一起被关押在了臭名昭著的罗宾岛（Robben Island）监狱之后，才接受正式的教育的；祖马清醒地认识到，非洲最大的问题是不平等问题，而不是在世界上被边缘化了的问题。	Zuma, who spent his youth herding cattle and only gained formal education while in the notorious Robben Island prison with Mandela, is refreshingly aware that Africa’s biggest problem is its inequalities, not its global marginalization.
