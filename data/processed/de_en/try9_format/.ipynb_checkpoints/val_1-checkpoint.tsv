Bislang ist bei der Anwendung von UNO-Resolutionen eher selektiv vorgegangen worden, und ich halte es für ein schwerwiegendes Versäumnis, dass Herr Laschet dies in seinem Bericht nicht angesprochen hat.	"Initial translation: Up to now we have been witnessing selective sensibilities in the application of UN resolutions and I think that this is a serious omission in Mr Laschet's report.

Analysis: the translation accurately captures the meaning

"Ausgehend von einem Anteil von 70% Schwarzgeld bei der Finanzierung der Wahlkampagnen in Quebec witzelt er: ""Mir wurde gesagt, dass dies nur ein schwacher Abklatsch der Wirklichkeit sei."""	"Initial translation: Starting with an 70% black money rate in the financing of Quebec election campaigns, he says: 'I was told that this was just a weak reflection of reality.'

Analysis: '""
The German ""Ausgehend von"" should be ""Estimating"" not ""Starting with"" - this is about making an estimate, not beginning something.  ""Schwarzgeld"" should be ""dirty money"" not ""black money"" which is the proper English term for illegal political financing.  The phrase ""witzelt er"" means ""he says dryly/jokingly"" not just ""he says"" - the humor aspect is lost.  ""schwacher Abklatsch"" should be ""pale reflection"" not ""weak reflection"" - this is a more idiomatic English expression

Corrected translation: Estimating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec at 70%, he says dryly: ""I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."""	error_correction
Die vorgeschlagene Änderung könnte sich so auswirken, dass sie den breit und allgemein gedachten Anwendungsbereich des Absatzes, der sich mit dem entscheidenden Aspekt der Kontrolle der Kapazitäten von Drittländern befasst, einschränkt.

CNMV genehmigt die von der Investmentgesellschaft Mer vorgelegte öffentliche Ausschlussausschreibung von Paternina	"Initial translation: CNMV authorises the public tender process for the Paternina project promoted by the investment company Mer

Analysis: The German ""Ausschlussausschreibung"" should be ""exclusion take-over bid"" not ""public tender process"" - this is a specific financial term that was incorrectly translated. The phrase ""öffentliche Ausschlussausschreibung von Paternina"" should be ""exclusion take-over bid submitted by Inversora Mer"" - the model misunderstood the relationship and made it seem like Paternina was a project rather than the target company. The German ""vorgelegte"" means ""submitted"" not ""promoted"", showing a lexical error

Corrected translation: CNMV authorized the exclusion take-over bid submitted by Inversora Mer"	error_correction
Dazwischen gab es immer wieder längere Anstiege, für die lange Trials belohnten.	"Initial translation: There were long periods of time when the market was rising, and long trials were rewarded.

Analysis: The German ""längere Anstiege"" should be ""long uphill climbs"" not ""long periods of time when the market was rising"" - this is a major semantic error where the model confused hiking/climbing context with financial markets. The phrase ""für die lange Trials belohnten"" should be ""for which long trials were the reward"" not ""and long trials were rewarded"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the causal relationship. The German is talking about hiking/climbing challenges, not financial markets. The model completely misunderstood the context

Corrected translation: In between, there were time and again long uphill climbs, for which long trials were the reward."	error_correction

Als sich die Polizei in Richtung Westen durch den großen Durcheinander an persönlichen Sachen der Protestler, unter anderem Koffer, Kunstrasen und Tüten mit Kleider, bewegten, folgten ihr Angestellte der Stadtreinigung, die aufhoben, was zurückgelassen worden war.	"Initial translation: As the police moved westwards through the great confusion of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, articulated lorries and rubbish bags, the town cleaners followed behind to collect the rubbish.

Analysis: The German ""großen Durcheinander"" should be ""dense tangle"" not ""great confusion"" - physical vs mental state. The phrase ""Kunstrasen"" should be ""plastic lawn"" not ""articulated lorries"" - completely wrong translation. The phrase ""Tüten mit Kleider"" should be ""leaf bags stuffed with clothing"" not ""rubbish bags"" - more specific. The phrase ""Angestellte der Stadtreinigung"" should be ""crews from the Sanitation Department"" not ""town cleaners"" - more formal. The phrase ""aufhoben, was zurückgelassen worden war"" should be ""scooping up what was left behind"" not ""collect the rubbish

Fortuna soll der Legende nach allen hold sein, die die Wände in der Gasse mit ihrem Sternzeichen berühren.	"Initial translation: Fortuna is said to smile on all who touch the walls of the street with their star sign.

Analysis: The German ""allen hold sein"" should be ""fortune will come to you"" not ""smile on all"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a different expression. The phrase ""die die Wände in der Gasse mit ihrem Sternzeichen berühren"" should be ""if you touch the walls on the street of your sign"" not ""who touch the walls of the street with their star sign"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the structure from conditional to relative clause. The German ""Gasse"" should be ""street"" which the model correctly translated, but the overall meaning about touching walls of your zodiac sign street is different from touching walls with your star sign

Corrected translation: They say, if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, fortune will come to you."	error_correction
Die EU sollte daher konkrete Maßnahmen in die Wege leiten, um der Straffreiheit für Täter, die sexuelle Gewalt gegen Frauen und Kinder verüben, ein Ende zu setzen.

Vor langer Zeit hätte man den Lauf von Lyth verlängert, aber er hatte die Kontrolle über sein eigenes Schicksal.	"Initial translation: Long ago, they would have extended the course of the Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.

Corrected translation: A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny."	error_correction
"Zudem bringt der Skandal weniger die Opfer, als vielmehr die ""Scharfrichter"" in Bedrängnis."	"Initial translation: The scandal is not so much bringing the victims into disrepute as it is bringing the 'executioners' into disrepute.

Analysis: The German should be ""affects both the victims and the 'executioners' equally"" not a comparative construction. The phrase ""bringt...in Bedrängnis"" means ""puts in difficult position/affects"" not ""brings into disrepute

Corrected translation: The scandal affects both the victims and the ""executioners"" equally."	error_correction
In San Francisco, also an der Westküste, setzt man sich ans Lenkrad - mit der Aufgabe, als erster in New York zu sein.	"Initial translation: In San Francisco, on the West Coast, they are at the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.

Analysis: The German ""setzt man sich ans Lenkrad"" should be ""You get in the car"" not ""they are at the wheel"" - the model changed from second person (""you"") to third person (""they""). The phrase ""als erster in New York zu sein"" should be ""to be the first one to reach New York"" not just ""being the first in New York"" - the ""reach"" aspect is important for understanding this is about arrival/completion. The model lost the direct address to the reader and simplified the achievement description

"Initial translation: Against Michal Hasek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice Region and the head of the Olomouc Region, Martin Tesarik.

Analysis: The word ""Gegen"" was translated as ""Against"" when this context requires understanding that these are names being listed, not opposed. The phrase ""aus dem Bezirk"" should be ""commissioner for"" not ""from the Region"" - this misunderstands their official roles. The model treats this as a geographical reference rather than recognizing these are political appointments or positions

Corrected translation: These are Michal Hašek, commissioner for South Moravia, Radko Martínek, commissioner for Pardubice, and Olomouc commissioner Martin Tesařík."	error_correction

Dann per Direktabnahme, die Torwart Roberto mit dem Knie parierte (35.).	"Initial translation: Then, by direct free kick, Roberto saved with his knee (35).

Analysis: The German ""Direktabnahme"" should be ""shot"" not ""direct free kick"" - this is a lexical error where the model confused different soccer terms. The phrase ""die Torwart Roberto mit dem Knie parierte"" should be ""which the goalie parried with his knee"" not ""Roberto saved with his knee"" - this is a semantic error where the model made Roberto the subject when he should be identified as the goalkeeper. The German indicates the goalkeeper Roberto, not just Roberto as a player. The model also omitted ""minute"" from the time reference

Corrected translation: Then with a shot which the goalie parried with his knee in the 35th minute."	error_correction

"""Nennen wir es lieber eine Weggehparty, ganz locker, mit ein paar Freunden, ein paar Drinks, ein paar Spielen."""	"Initial translation: Let us call it a stroll, a walk, a party, a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.

Analysis: The German ""Weggehparty"" should be ""going away party"" not ""stroll, a walk, a party"" - this is a single compound concept, not multiple activities. The phrase ""ganz locker"" (really relaxed) was completely omitted. The structure should maintain the party context ""with a few friends, a couple of drinks and the odd game"" not fragment into separate items. The model broke down the compound word incorrectly and lost the coherent meaning

Corrected translation: ""Lets just call it a going away party, really relaxed with a few friends, a couple of drinks and the odd game."""	error_correction
"""Mit der Hand oder beim Hinsetzen darf man die Federn auf keinen Fall spüren"", warnt Helena Prokopová."	"Initial translation: Helena Prokopová warns that 'neither hand nor foot must touch the feathers'.

"Initial translation: With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., the time scheduled for the programme, the Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias landed at the Benito Juárez International Airport in Mexico City.

"Initial translation: Daniela Ruf points out that there are many of their own buildings which are not really moving forward, and now they are leaning out of the window to look at the Community space, she says: 'I find it difficult'.

Analysis: The German idiom ""sich aus dem Fenster lehnen"" should be ""going out of their way"" not literally ""leaning out of the window"" - this is about taking risks or making extra effort. The phrase ""mit denen man nicht so recht voran komme"" should be ""that are not really being forged ahead"" not ""not really moving forward"" to match the target's stronger language. The word ""Gemeinschaftsraum"" should be ""common room"" not ""Community space

Sieht sich Deutschland selbst in der Rolle als wichtiger internationaler Spieler - will Deutschland überhaupt eine Hauptrolle übernehmen?	"Initial translation: Is Germany itself going to play a major international role - does Germany want to play a major international role?

Analysis: The phrase ""wichtiger internationaler Spieler"" should be ""important international player"" not ""major international role"" - ""Spieler"" means player, not role.  The second part ""will Deutschland überhaupt eine Hauptrolle übernehmen"" should be ""does Germany actually want to assume a leading role"" not ""does Germany want to play a major international role"" - ""übernehmen"" means assume, and ""Hauptrolle"" is leading role.  The model repeated similar phrasing instead of capturing the distinction between viewing oneself as a player versus assuming a leading role

Corrected translation: Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role?"	error_correction

Er widerspricht auch der Behauptung, er sei nur ein Vorsitzender der Tschechen.	"Initial translation: It also contradicts the assertion that he is only the chairman of the Czechs.

Daraus formten alle vier Tiere einen Haken, mit dessen Hilfe sie dann das Eimerchen am Griff aus dem Röhrchen angelten.	"Initial translation: All four animals then formed a hook with which they then managed to catch the marble in the tube.

Analysis: The German ""Eimerchen"" means ""little bucket"" but was translated as ""marble"" - this is a significant object misidentification that changes the entire scenario from retrieving a bucket to catching a marble. The phrase ""am Griff aus dem Röhrchen angelten"" means ""fished the bucket out of the tube by its handle"" but became ""managed to catch the marble in the tube"" - this loses the fishing action and the specific detail about using the handle. The word ""Tiere"" was correctly translated as ""animals"" though the reference uses ""birds"" which might be more contextually accurate

"Initial translation: This year, as in previous years, there is a special 70-cent stamp designed by one of them for the Art & Enjoyment event, available at every art station.

Analysis: The German ""anlässlich von Kunst & Genuss"" should be ""designed on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss (art and enjoyment)"" - the target keeps the German name and adds translation in parentheses, while the model translates it completely. The phrase ""von ihnen entworfene"" should not include ""by one of them"" as this assumes a specific designer from a group not mentioned in this sentence.

Mit diesem Vorschlag schafft der Fotograf eine besondere Ikonografie der Flamencodarstellung auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen.	"Initial translation: This proposal creates a special iconography of flamenco representation at different levels.

Analysis: The German ""Mit diesem Vorschlag schafft der Fotograf"" should be ""This is the photograph's aim when collecting"" not ""This proposal creates"" - the model misunderstood the subject and purpose. The word ""Vorschlag"" in this context should be understood as the photographer's approach/aim, not a literal proposal. The phrase ""eine besondere Ikonografie"" should be ""an original iconography"" not ""a special iconography"" - different emphasis. The German ""auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen"" should be ""taken from different perspectives"" not ""at different levels"" - wrong interpretation of ""Ebenen"" in photography context. The model completely changed the meaning from a photographer's goal to collect iconography to a proposal creating representation

Corrected translation: This is the photograph's aim when collecting an original iconography of flamenco, taken from different perspectives."	error_correction
Wie immer gibt es auch mürrische Spielverderber, die sich immer über etwas beschweren müssen.	"Initial translation: As always, there are also grumpy people who always have to complain about something.

Analysis: The German ""mürrische Spielverderber"" should be ""po-faced killjoys"" not ""grumpy people"" - this is more colorful, specific language describing people who spoil fun in a sourly serious way. The phrase ""die sich immer über etwas beschweren müssen"" should be ""looking for something to complain about"" not ""who always have to complain about something"" - the reference suggests active seeking rather than compulsive behavior.

Analysis: The name ""El Juli"" should remain as ""El Juli"" not translated to ""July"" - this is a proper name (likely a bullfighter's stage name), not the month. The phrase ""Arena de Los Llanos"" should be ""bull-ring of Los Llanos"" not ""Arena de Los Llanos"" - using the English term for the venue type. The phrase ""ohne Schwierigkeit, aber auch ohne Ruhm"" should be ""gaining no glory, no penalty"" not ""without difficulty, but without glory"" - the reference emphasizes the neutral result with ""gaining no glory, no penalty"" rather than just describing absence of difficulty and glory. The phrase ""Und noch schlechter"" should be ""Among all, the worst"" not ""And even worse"" - this provides comparative context among multiple performers

Und ich habe auch schon im offenen Ganztag an der Schule gearbeitet.	"Initial translation: I have also worked in a full-time job in a school.

Analysis: The German ""im offenen Ganztag an der Schule"" should be ""at the full-day school in their supplementary activities"" not ""in a full-time job in a school"" - this is a semantic error where the model confused ""offenen Ganztag"" (open all-day program) with full-time employment. The phrase ""offenen Ganztag"" refers to an extended school day program with supplementary activities, not a full-time job. The model simplified the specific educational concept to general employment terms

"Von den hiesigen Einwohnern bekam das Haus mit seinen organischen Formen den Spitznamen ""Knochenhaus""."	"Initial translation: The locals called the House of Parliament 'bone house' because of its organic forms.

Analysis: The German text doesn't mention ""House of Parliament"" - this appears to be completely added by the model. The phrase ""bekam das Haus...den Spitznamen"" should be ""started to call it the House of bones"" not ""called the House of Parliament 'bone house'"" - the model inserted an incorrect building identification. The phrase ""Knochenhaus"" should be ""House of bones"" not ""bone house"" - different capitalization and structure. The phrase ""mit seinen organischen Formen"" should be ""for its organic shapes"" not ""because of its organic forms"" - different causal structure

Corrected translation: The locals started to call it the House of bones for its organic shapes."	error_correction
Schnell führten die Hausherren mit 8:1, auch die frühe Auszeit, die Bieletzki genommen hatte, fruchtete zunächst nicht.	"Initial translation: The House quickly led 8:1, and even the early bath that Bielecki had taken did not bear fruit at first.

Analysis: The German ""Hausherren"" should be ""home team"" not ""The House"" - this is a sports context referring to the team playing at home. The phrase ""Auszeit"" should be ""break"" or ""timeout"" not ""early bath"" which is completely wrong and suggests someone was bathing. The name ""Bieletzki"" was changed to ""Bielecki"" which is a different spelling. These errors completely change the sports context into something nonsensical

"Initial translation: However, they were all in agreement that without the preparatory work done by the previous coaching team, the game and the fight would not have been possible.

Analysis: The phrase ""spielerisch und kämpferisch starke Vorstellung"" should be ""strong performance, both in terms of play and spirit"" not ""the game and the fight"" - the model oversimplified and changed the meaning from a performance evaluation to basic activities. The phrase ""abgelöste Trainerteam"" should be ""replaced team of coaches"" not ""previous coaching team"" - ""abgelöst"" specifically means replaced/dismissed, not just previous. The model lost the nuanced description of the performance quality

The phrase ""die Zentralregierung mit der Lokalregierung in Dardjiling wolle"" should be ""the central government can negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling"" not ""wanted to intervene in the local judicial system"" - ""wolle"" here means ""wants to negotiate/work with"" not ""wanted to intervene

Versuchen Sie zu spüren, wann ein Kommilitone von Geselligkeit erschöpft ist - und schicken Sie ihm eine SMS statt anzuklopfen.	"Initial translation: Try to work out when a fellow student has had enough of socialising - and send him a text message instead of knocking on his door.

Analysis: The German ""spüren"" should be ""sense"" not ""work out"" - sensing is more intuitive while working out is more analytical. The phrase ""von Geselligkeit erschöpft"" should be ""exhausted from socialising"" not ""has had enough of socialising"" - exhaustion is a stronger physical state than just having enough. The target uses ""maybe text"" which is more casual than ""send him a text message,"" and omits ""on his door"" for brevity. The model's translation is more verbose and formal than the target

Corrected translation: Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking."	error_correction
"Nur so viel: ""Es schmeckt zusammen noch besser"", findet er."	"Initial translation: He says that it tastes even better.

Analysis: The German ""Nur so viel"" should be ""Just enough so that"" not omitted - this phrase provides important context about the limited information being shared. The phrase ""Es schmeckt zusammen noch besser"" should be ""They taste much better together"" not ""it tastes even better"" - this is about multiple items tasting better when combined, not one thing tasting better. The model omitted the collaborative aspect and the contextual framing. The word ""findet"" should be ""reckons"" not ""says"" for more informal tone

Corrected translation: Just enough so that, ""They taste much better together,"" he reckons."	error_correction
"Ob sein eigenes Paket an allen Ecken verfassungsfest ist und ob es tatsächlich ""zumutbar"" ist für den Koalitionspartner, muss sich erst noch zeigen."	"Initial translation: Whether his own package is watertight at all points and whether it is actually 'palatable' for the coalition partner will have to be seen.

Analysis: The German ""verfassungsfest"" means ""constitutional/in line with the constitution"" not ""watertight"" - this is a legal term about constitutional compliance. The word ""zumutbar"" means ""reasonable/acceptable"" not ""palatable"" - it's about what can reasonably be expected. The phrase refers to ""citizens"" not ""coalition partner"" - this changes the political context. The phrase structure should be ""However, it remains to be seen"" not ""will have to be seen""

Corrected translation: However, it remains to be seen whether his own package is in line with the constitution throughout, and whether it really is ""achievable"" for his coalition partner."	error_correction
Eine interessante Methode ist derzeit die Verwendung der zweiten Hand als etwas ungewöhnliche Projektionsunterlage.	"Initial translation: One interesting method is to use the second hand as an unusual projection surface.

Analysis: The German context seems to be about photography or imaging where ""zweiten Hand"" refers to ""second hand"" as in a clock hand, and this is used as ""a sort of matrix for the image"" not a ""projection surface"". The word ""Projektionsfläche"" would be projection surface, but the German says ""Projektions

Corrected translation: For now, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of matrix for the image."	error_correction

Das Brückenfest verband mit den bayerischen Nachbarn am Sonntag gesellig, tags zuvor ein Zweibrückenlauf sportlich - organisiert von der Union Wernstein und Bayern aus Neukirchen.	"Initial translation: The bridge festival brought the Bavarian neighbours together socially on Sunday, having run a 2-Bridge race on Saturday organised by the Union Wernstein and Bayern aus Neukirchen.

Analysis: The model misunderstood the complex sentence structure and relationship between events. The German should be understood as describing the Bridge Festival as a joint effort where ""the Bridge Festival Association organises the social event on Sunday and an athletic two bridge walk the day before with their Bavarian neighbours"" - the reference shows this as an ongoing organizational structure, not just a past event. The phrase ""tags zuvor"" should be ""the day before"" and the model correctly identified this, but lost the organizational context. The grammatical structure using ""having run"" creates confusion about timing and causation

Corrected translation: The Bridge Festival is a joint effort between Wernstein and Bavarians from Neukirchen; the Bridge Festival Association organises the social event on Sunday and an athletic two bridge walk the day before with their Bavarian neighbours."	error_correction

Ein weiteres Argument des Verteidigungsministeriums ist der Mengenrabatt für die 445 Kilometer Zündschnur.	"Initial translation: Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the volume discount for the 445 kilometres of fuse.

Analysis: The German ""Verteidigungsministeriums"" should be ""Ministry"" not ""Ministry of Defence"" - the target uses the shorter form. The phrase ""Mengenrabatt"" should be ""quantity discount"" not ""volume discount"" - these are subtly different commercial terms. The word ""Zündschnur"" should be ""ignition cords"" not ""fuse"" - the target uses the more specific technical term. The model was more specific with ministry type but less precise with technical terminology

Man muss sich ja immer wieder um eine Wiederwahl bemühen, das werde ich tun.	"Initial translation: You have to keep on trying to get re-elected, and I will.

Analysis: The German ""Man muss sich ja immer wieder um eine Wiederwahl bemühen"" should be ""A re-election should be attempted"" not ""You have to keep on trying to get re-elected"" - the target uses more formal, impersonal language. The phrase ""das werde ich tun"" should be ""and that is what I will do"" not ""and I will"" - the target is more specific about doing that particular thing

"Das Klavier-Solo demonstriert nun selbiges: Was wäre aus dem Komponieren Mozarts entsprungen, hätte ""das Nannerl"" die Tür unverhofft aufgemacht?"	"Initial translation: The piano solo now demonstrates the same: what would Mozart have written if 'Nannerl' had unexpectedly opened the door?

Analysis: The phrase ""Was wäre aus dem Komponieren Mozarts entsprungen"" should be ""How would Mozart's career as a composer turned out"" not ""what would Mozart have written"" - this is about his career development/outcome, not specific compositions.  The phrase ""hätte 'das Nannerl' die Tür unverhofft aufgemacht"" should be ""if his older sister 'the Nannerl' had suddenly opened the door"" not ""if 'Nannerl' had unexpectedly opened the door"" - missing the family relationship and the definite article

"Initial translation: Some of the defendants are now considering making a confession to the fraudulent accounting procedures that have already been laid before the public prosecutor.

Analysis: The German ""wird nun...gerechnet"" should be ""are likely to confess"" not ""are now considering"" - this is about expectation, not deliberation. The phrase ""Rechnungsfälschung"" should be ""invoice production"" not ""fraudulent accounting procedures"" - while related, the target uses different terminology. The phrase ""vor der Staatsanwaltschaft abgelegt wurden"" should be ""as they did at the attorney's department"" not ""laid before the public prosecutor"" - the target simplifies the legal language. The sentence structure is overly complex compared to the target's simpler phrasing

Corrected translation: Some defendants are likely to confess about the process of the invoice production - as they did at the attorney's department, too."	error_correction
Reicht es für den 18-Jährigen Ungarn, der im Januar 2016 noch die Nummer eins der Junioren-Weltrangliste war, nicht, füllt jemand aus dem Trainerstab um Marius Zay den Kader auf.	"Initial translation: Is it enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian who was number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, to fill the team with someone from the coaching staff, Marius Zay?

Analysis: which creates a conditional relationship (if not enough, then someone fills). Instead, the model created a question about whether it's enough to fill the team, completely inverting the meaning. The phrase ""jemand aus dem Trainerstab um Marius Zay"" should be ""someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay"" but the model placed ""Marius Zay"" incorrectly as if he's the person filling the squad rather than leading the coaching staff. The translation fails to complete the conditional logic properly

"Initial translation: Regine Kunde from the Working Group on the EU says that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying woolly mammoth, which has a particular problem.

Analysis: The German ""Arbeitskreis"" should be ""working group"" not ""Working Group on the EU"" - this is a named entity error where the model added ""on the EU"" which doesn't exist in the German. The phrase ""eierlegende Wollmilchsau"" should be ""jack-of-all-trades"" not ""egg-laying woolly mammoth"" - this is a lexical error where the model was too literal with a German idiom. The phrase ""die vor allem ein Problem hat"" should be ""to help anyone experiencing difficulties"" not ""which has a particular problem"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the meaning from helping people with problems to having a problem itself

"Initial translation: State money and subsidies from the self-government - in total HUF 65 million - were to have been partly paid into the accounts of the Young Democrats, partly into private accounts of individual people.

Analysis: The German ""Fiatal Baloldal"" should remain as ""Fiatal Baloldal"" (the actual organization name) not be translated to ""Young Democrats"" which is a different political organization. The phrase ""einzelner"" should be ""other people"" not ""individual people"" to match the target's simpler phrasing. The structure ""sollen...geflossen sein"" should be ""have been shared between"" not ""were to have been partly paid into"" which is more complex than needed.

Analysis: The German ""Entstanden sei eine Bilder-Bibel"" means ""The result is a picture Bible"" but this crucial concluding statement was completely omitted. The phrase ""auf Augenhöhe"" should be ""between partners"" not ""on an equal footing"" - while similar, ""between partners"" emphasizes the collaborative relationship aspect.

Analysis: The model missed that Putin ""decided not to travel to Zurich"" (omitted completely). The phrase ""unumwundenen Andeutung"" means ""veiled reference"" not ""unambiguous suggestion"" - it's actually the opposite, suggesting indirect/subtle reference. The model also misunderstood that Putin ""denounced"" the unfair competition rather than ""taking on board"" the suggestion.

Analysis: The German ""schwindsüchtigen Steuereingänge"" should be ""inadequate tax revenues"" not ""sickly tax revenues"" - while ""schwindsüchtig"" means consumptive/wasting, the target uses ""inadequate"" which is more appropriate for financial context. The phrase ""den Staat in Gefahr bringen, seinen Finanzierungsbedarf nicht mehr decken zu können"" should be ""placing the State in in danger of no longer being able to cover its financial requirements"" not ""threaten to bankrupt the state"" - the model simplified complex financial language.

The phrase ""vor rumäniendeutschen Schriftstellerkollegen"" should be ""before Romano-German writer colleagues"" not just ""among other writers"" - the model lost the specific ethnic/cultural designation and the formal ""before"" relationship.

The phrase ""bleiben dem Traditionsbewerb also erhalten"" should be ""are therefore surviving in the traditional competition"" not ""therefore remain"" - this is a semantic error where the model simplified the meaning of being preserved in the competition.

Während ich den Anschein gebe, die Jeans-Hotpants zu mustern, beobachte ich eine Gruppe junger Teenagemädchen, die sich für einen Moment um Polaroid Kameras gruppieren, bevor eine Vater und seine Tochter sich überlegen, einen Crosley Plattenspieler zu kaufen.	"Initial translation: While I appear to be measuring jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.

Analysis: The German ""den Anschein gebe...zu mustern"" should be ""giving the illusion of perusing"" not ""appear to be measuring"" - different sophistication level and ""perusing"" vs ""measuring

Corrected translation: While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player."	error_correction

Am Mittwoch und in der Nacht zum Donnerstag bläst der Föhn teilweise mit Sturmstärke durch die Föhntäler.	"Initial translation: On Wednesday and Thursday night, the foehn was blowing with storm force in the Föhn valleys.

Analysis: The German uses future tense ""bläst"" and ""Nacht zum Donnerstag"" should be ""continuing through the night"" not ""Thursday night"" - this changes Wednesday night to Thursday night. The phrase ""teilweise mit Sturmstärke"" should be ""sometimes at gale force"" not ""with storm force"" - the ""teilweise"" (partially/sometimes) qualifier was lost. The model also changed from future prediction to past tense reporting

Corrected translation: The foehn will blow through the Foehn Valleys on Wednesday, continuing through the night, sometimes at gale force."	error_correction
Geholfen wäre vielen Flüchtlingen aber auch schon mit mehr allgemeinmedizinischen Anlaufstellen in den Notfallambulanzen.	"Initial translation: But it would have helped many refugees if there had been more general practitioners in the emergency departments.

Analysis: The German ""Geholfen wäre vielen Flüchtlingen aber auch schon mit"" should be ""But many refugees would also already be helped with"" not ""it would have helped...if there had been"" - the model changed from conditional present to past counterfactual. The phrase ""allgemeinmedizinischen Anlaufstellen"" should be ""general medicine drop-in centres"" not ""general practitioners"" - this is about centers/facilities, not individual doctors. The word ""Notfallambulanzen"" should be ""emergency rooms"" not ""emergency departments"" to match target terminology. The grammatical mood was changed from possible help to hypothetical past help

"Initial translation: Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) 'calls on all parties involved to adopt a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision'; it calls on employees to act against the orders of authoritarian management.

Analysis: The German ""IE"" should be translated as ""CI"" (Competitive Intelligence) not kept as ""IE"" - this is the English equivalent. The phrase ""sie beansprucht von den Mitarbeitern einen Einsatz, dem die Anweisungen des autoritären Managements gänzlich widersprechen"" should be ""it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradicted by authoritarian management methods"" not ""calls on employees to act against the orders"" - the contradiction is inherent, not an instruction to oppose.

"Initial translation: According to pyrotechnicians who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech army is expecting the same problem in a few years' time with the disposal of hundreds of kilometres of fuse wire it has bought so cheaply today.

Analysis: The German ""Die tschechischen Streitkräfte"" should be ""The Czech one"" not ""the Czech army"" - more generic reference. The phrase ""bei der Liquidierung"" should be ""They will dispose of"" not ""with the disposal"" - different grammatical structure and subject. The word ""Zündschnüre"" should be ""igniter cords"" not ""fuse wire"" - different technical terminology. The structure should emphasize that they will face the disposal problem, not that they're expecting it. The model made the sentence more specific than the original and changed the technical terminology

Analysis: The German ""Unabhängig davon"" should be ""Either way"" not ""Independently"" in this context. The phrase ""die Wahl beeinträchtigt"" (affected the election) was omitted. The crucial phrase ""in ein schlechtes Licht gerückt"" should be ""casting suspicion on"" not just ""damaged

The phrase ""an diesem Donnerstag"" should be ""on Thursday"" not ""today"" - this is a temporal reference error. The word ""Tarifkonflikt"" should be ""pay dispute"" not ""tariff dispute"" - this is about salary negotiations, not trade tariffs.

Analysis: The German ""Biker-Frühschoppen"" was translated as ""biker breakfast"" but ""Frühschoppen"" specifically refers to a late morning social gathering with drinks, more accurately translated as ""biker brunch"" in the reference. The phrase ""es durfte sich...gestärkt werden"" (attendees had a chance to tuck into) was simplified to just ""with"" losing the sense of people actively strengthening themselves with food.

Analysis: The German ""dabei sein"" should be ""scrub in"" not ""be there for"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a less technical medical term. The phrase ""Blut abzutupfen"" should be ""blot blood away"" not ""stop the blood"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the action from blotting/dabbing to stopping.

Er liefert mir die Schlagringe ebenfalls nur deshalb, weil er weiß, dass ich ihn nicht verpfeife.	"Initial translation: He gives me the hooks because he knows I will not bite.

Analysis: The German ""Schlagringe"" means ""knuckle dusters/brass knuckles"" but was translated as ""hooks"" - this is a significant misidentification of a weapon type. The phrase ""dass ich ihn nicht verpfeife"" is idiomatic meaning ""that I won't rat him out/give him away"" but was translated literally as ""I will not bite"" - this completely misses the idiomatic meaning about not informing on someone. The reference correctly captures this with ""I won't give him away"" which preserves the sense of not betraying or informing on the person. Both errors fundamentally change the meaning from weapon trafficking with trust about silence to something about hooks and biting

The word ""Hansjakobdarsteller"" (actor portraying Hansjakob) was simplified to just ""actor"" losing the specific role information.

The model made it a comparison between Monica and other girls about keeping reputations, which isn't the intended meaning.

The phrase ""vor dem Deich"" should be ""in front of the embankment"" not ""before the dyke"" - while ""dyke"" is correct, ""embankment"" matches the reference and ""in front of"" is more natural than ""before

The phrase ""Straßenmeistereien"" should be ""snowploughs"" not just ""road authorities"" - these are specific winter road maintenance crews. The term ""schlecht befahrbar"" means ""difficult to pass"" not just ""in a bad state"" - it's about passability, not general condition.

Analysis: The German ""kreuzten...an"" should be ""ticked"" not ""were more likely to have had"" - wrong tense and meaning. The word ""Knödel"" should be ""dumplings"" not ""potatoes"" - these are completely different foods. The phrase ""waren bereit, weniger...zu essen"" should be ""limiting"" not ""were willing to eat fewer"" - the meaning implies they actually did limit, not just willingness. The structure should emphasize the positive choices (poultry/fish) and then mention the limitation aspect

Corrected translation: In addition, for their main course, children ticked poultry and fish more often, limiting sweet meals and dumplings."	error_correction

Insgesamt seien vier Verkehrsschauen durchgeführt worden, auch ein Kreisverkehr wurde angedacht, allerdings wegen der Enge in dem Kreuzungsbereich Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße wieder verworfen.	"Initial translation: Four traffic exhibitions have been held, including one roundabout, but the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße junction has led to the roundabout being abandoned.

Analysis: The German ""Verkehrsschauen"" should be ""road safety inspections"" not ""traffic exhibitions"" - these are formal safety assessments, not public displays. The phrase ""auch ein Kreisverkehr wurde angedacht"" should be ""and a roundabout was also considered"" not ""including one roundabout"" - this was considered but not built. The phrase ""wegen der Enge in dem Kreuzungsbereich"" should be ""on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junctions"" not ""but the narrowness of the junction has led to"" - the model structure suggests the roundabout was built then abandoned, when it was only considered then rejected

Corrected translation: A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered, however, this idea was rejected on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junctions."	error_correction
"""Er erwischte den Puck, ich nahm Fahrt auf und (Read) zog zu entfernteren Pfosten."""	"Initial translation: He caught the puck, I took off and (Read) went to the far post.

Analysis: The German ""erwischte"" in hockey context should be ""poked out"" not ""caught"" - this refers to deflecting the puck, not catching it. The phrase ""nahm Fahrt auf"" should be ""gained speed"" not ""took off"" - the latter implies leaving/departing rather than accelerating. The phrase ""zu entfernteren Pfosten"" should be ""to the more distant pole"" not ""to the far post"" - the comparative form is important, and ""pole"" is more accurate than ""post"" in this context. The translation maintains the bracketed ""(Read)"" correctly

Corrected translation: ""He poked out the puck, I gained speed, and Read went on to the more distant pole."""	error_correction
Herr Präsident, Herr Kommissar!

"Wie vielseitig die Aufgabenbereiche eines Gartenbauvereins sind, zeigten die Mitglieder der Hutschdorfer Jugendgruppe ""Maulwürfe"" unterhaltsam auf der Bühne."	"Initial translation: The diversity of tasks of a horticultural society was demonstrated by the members of the Hutschdorf youth group 'Mole' in an amusing manner on stage.

Analysis: The German ""Maulwürfe"" should be ""Maulwürfe"" (moles) with explanation, not just 'Mole' - the target shows the proper format with German name and English translation in parentheses. The phrase ""Wie vielseitig...sind"" should be ""how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are"" not ""The diversity of tasks...was demonstrated"" - the sentence structure should emphasize the demonstration of versatility. The word ""unterhaltsam"" should be ""entertainingly"" not ""in an amusing manner"" for more natural flow. The word ""Gartenbauvereins"" should be ""gardening club"" not ""horticultural society"" to match the target's simpler terminology

Corrected translation: The members of the Hutschdorf youth group ""Maulwürfe"" (moles) showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are."	error_correction
Dadurch, dass der Bericht die wunden Punkte des Waldes anerkennt, trägt er in begrüßenswerter Weise zur laufenden Debatte über Naturkatastrophen bei.

Ihr geht es wie der Linken, der SPD, den Grünen: in den Weiten des Landes kaum vorhanden.	"Initial translation: They are as rare as the left, the SPD and the Greens: few and far between.

Analysis: The German ""Ihr geht es wie"" means ""they are suffering like"" not just ""they are as rare as"" - it's about experiencing the same difficulty, not just similarity. The phrase ""in den Weiten des Landes kaum vorhanden"" means ""hardly present across large swathes of the region"" not just ""few and far between

Corrected translation: They are suffering like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present across large swathes of the region."	error_correction
Und die Geißel des Mesotheliom ist nicht auf ehemaliger Arbeiter der Baubranche beschränkt.	"Initial translation: And the whip of mesothelioma is not confined to former workers in the construction industry.

Analysis: The German ""Geißel"" means ""scourge"" not ""whip"" - while both are literal meanings, ""scourge"" is the appropriate metaphorical term for a disease/plague. The phrase ""ehemaliger Arbeiter"" should be ""veterans"" not ""former workers"" in this context about occupational disease. The term ""Baubranche"" is ""building industry"" but ""industrial building jobs"" is more specific to the hazardous exposure context. The model's translation is too literal

Corrected translation: And the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs."	error_correction

Die Zimmer von Menschen verwandeln sich oft in Getränke-Rezeptionen, Film-Nacht Veranstaltungsorte und kommunale Treffpunkte, aber sie sind auch die Stellen, an denen Menschen sich anziehen und ihre Unterwäsche zurechtrücken.	"Initial translation: Often, rooms become bars, nights of film become places of community, but they are also the places where people undress and where they get dressed.

Analysis: The German ""Getränke-Rezeptionen"" should be ""drinks receptions"" not ""bars"" - these are social events, not establishments. The phrase ""Film-Nacht Veranstaltungsorte"" should be ""movie-night venues"" not ""nights of film become places of community"" which is confusing. The phrase ""kommunale Treffpunkte"" (communal hangout spots) was completely omitted. The ending ""ihre Unterwäsche zurechtrücken"" should be ""adjust their underwear"" not ""undress and where they get dressed"" - the model changed and added actions

Corrected translation: People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear."	error_correction

Der Bahn macht auch seit Jahren zu schaffen, dass sie Achsen von ICE-Zügen deutlich häufiger in der Werkstatt prüfen lassen muss, nachdem ein ICE im Kölner Hauptbahnhof einen Achsenbruch hatte.	"Initial translation: The railways have been having to cope with axle failures on ICE trains for years, after an ICE broke an axle in Cologne Central Station.

Analysis: The German ""Der Bahn"" should be ""Deutsche Bahn"" not ""The railways"" - this refers to the specific German railway company. The phrase ""macht...zu schaffen, dass sie...prüfen lassen muss"" should be ""has been forced to have...checked significantly more frequently"" not ""have been having to cope with axle failures"" - the model misunderstood this as being about failures rather than increased inspection requirements. The phrase ""deutlich häufiger in der Werkstatt prüfen lassen"" means checking more frequently, not coping with failures

Corrected translation: Deutsche Bahn has also been forced to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more frequently for many years, after an ICE train's axle broke in Cologne's main station."	error_correction
Man kann nicht 7500 Mitarbeitern seine Kinder vorsetzen, wenn sie nicht ausreichend befähigt sind.	"Initial translation: You cannot put 7500 people's children in front of them if they are not properly qualified.

Analysis: The German ""Man kann nicht 7500 Mitarbeitern seine Kinder vorsetzen"" means ""one cannot put one's (own) children in charge of 7500 employees"" but the model misinterpreted this as ""put 7500 people's children in front of them"" - this completely reverses whose children are being discussed and changes from nepotism (boss's children managing employees) to some unclear scenario about employees' children. The phrase ""vorsetzen"" in this context means ""put in charge of"" not literally ""put in front of"". The pronoun reference was completely lost, fundamentally altering the meaning about nepotism in management

Corrected translation: One cannot put one's children in charge of 7,500 employees if they are not capable of this."	error_correction
In Petersburg haben wir welche, die Experten sein könnten, aber ihnen wird der Weg versperrt, da es hochrangigerer Experten bedarf, die die Ersteren richtig bewerten und ihnen den Weg freimachen.

Analysis: The model created redundancy with ""experts who could be experts"" when the German means ""people who could be experts

Die Nation verlor 50000 Soldaten in Vietnam und wurde mit einem Tritt in den Hintern wieder nach Hause geschickt.	"Initial translation: The nation lost 50 000 soldiers in Vietnam and was kicked out of the country with a kick in the backside.

Analysis: The German idiom ""mit einem Tritt in den Hintern"" should be ""with its tail between its legs"" not ""with a kick in the backside"" - while both convey humiliation, the target uses the more idiomatic English expression. The phrase ""wieder nach Hause geschickt"" should be ""sent home"" not ""kicked out of the country"" - the target is more direct and doesn't specify location

Corrected translation: In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with its tail between its legs."	error_correction

Analysis: The translation is incomplete - it omits crucial information about the reforms' relationship to austerity measures. The German ""die zu den Sparmaßnahmen hinzukommen"" meaning ""which are additional to measures of austerity"" was completely omitted. The phrase ""jedoch Wirkungen in näherer Zukunft zeigen sollen"" should be ""with a more rapid effect"" not ""will have an effect in the near future"" - the target emphasizes rapidity rather than just future timing. The sentence fragment lacks the context that explains what these reforms add to
