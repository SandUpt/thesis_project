Analysis: The German ""ausgetauscht"" should be ""exchanged"" not ""replaced"" in military/aviation context. The term ""doppelsitzigen"" (two-seat) was omitted

Corrected translation: ""Two-seat L-159T1 aircrafts were exchanged in the current condition and form,"" Pejsek told Pravo."	error_correction

Ein neugeborenes Kind kann im Orbit nicht wie ein Erwachsener zum Training in einen Belastungsanzug gesteckt werden."	"Initial translation: A newborn baby cannot be put in a pressure suit like an adult.

Analysis: The German ""im Orbit"" (in orbit) is completely omitted from the prediction - this crucial spatial context is missing. The phrase ""zum Training in einen Belastungsanzug gesteckt werden"" should be ""dressed...into a special loading suit for training"" not ""put in a pressure suit"" - ""loading suit"" vs ""pressure suit"" and the training purpose is less clear. The phrase ""wie ein Erwachsener"" should be ""as they do with adults"" not ""like an adult"" - different comparison structure

Corrected translation: It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training, as they do with adults."	error_correction

"Translate the following German to English:
Der Präsident zögerte drei Monate, ist aber auf keine bessere Idee gekommen und so hat er den General wenistens um 10.000 Soldaten betrogen."	"Initial translation: The President hesitated for three months, but he has come up with no better idea and so he has cheated the general by 10 000 soldiers.

Analysis: The German ""ist aber auf keine bessere Idee gekommen"" should be ""but failed to come up with anything better"" not ""has come up with no better idea"" - the tense should be past perfect. The phrase ""hat er den General wenistens um 10.000 Soldaten betrogen"" should be ""at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers"" - the model missed that this is an incomplete sentence structure where something is missing. The word ""betrogen"" in this context means the general was deprived/cheated out of having these soldiers, but the reference target suggests the sentence is incomplete

Corrected translation: The president hesitated for three months, but failed to come up with anything better, and so at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Die einen haben einen zu kurzen Hals, die anderen eine zu jungenhafte Figur ohne ordentliche Kurven und wieder andere sind mollig."	"Initial translation: Some have a neck too short, others are too young and have no proper curves, and others are just too soft.

Analysis: The German ""zu kurzen Hals"" should be ""short neck"" not ""neck too short"" - this is a grammatical error in word order. The phrase ""zu jungenhafte Figur"" should be ""boyish figure"" not ""are too young"" - this is a semantic error where the model confused ""jungenhafte"" (boyish) with age. The German ""mollig"" should be ""overweight"" not ""too soft"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a euphemism instead of the more direct term. The model also changed the structure from ""One has... the other has... yet another is

Corrected translation: One has a short neck, the other has a boyish figure without proper curves, yet another is overweight."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Nach meiner Karriere möchte ich zumindest einigermaßen gerade gehen können."	"Initial translation: I would like to be able to look back on my career and say that I have done something.

Analysis: The German ""zumindest einigermaßen gerade gehen können"" should be ""walk straight, to be honest"" not ""look back on my career and say that I have done something"" - this is a major semantic error where the model completely changed the meaning from physical mobility to career reflection. The phrase ""Nach meiner Karriere"" should be ""After my career"" which the model changed to ""look back on my career"". The model omitted the entire concept of physical walking and replaced it with abstract career satisfaction

Corrected translation: After my career I would like to walk straight, to be honest."""	error_correction

""Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn"", rief mir einer der Sanitäter auf Anfrage zu und verschwand im Getümmel."	"Initial translation: That is what they are for, said one of the paramedics when I asked him, and he disappeared into the crowd.

Analysis: The German dialect ""Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn"" means ""It's the ones that can't take any more"" but was completely misunderstood as ""That is what they are for"" - losing the meaning about people who can't cope anymore. The German ""rief mir...zu"" should be ""shouted when I asked him about it"" not just ""said when I asked him"" - missing the urgency and specific reference (""about it""). The phrase ""im Getümmel"" should be ""in the crowd"" not ""into the crowd"" - the paramedic disappeared within the existing crowd, not moving into it. The model fundamentally misunderstood the dialectal expression about human limits

Corrected translation: `It's the ones that can't take any more,' one of the paramedics shouted when I asked him about it, disappearing in the crowd."	error_correction

"Translate the following German to English:
Die Geburt könnte zum Beispiel auch in einer Spezialkammer stattfinden, um das Kind herauszupressen."	"Initial translation: The birth could also take place in a special room to force the child out.

Analysis: The German ""um das Kind herauszupressen"" should be ""she will push out the baby"" not ""to force the child out"" - this changes from the mother's active pushing to external force being applied. The word ""könnte"" should be interpreted as ""Maybe she will"" not ""could also"" - the target suggests possibility for the mother's action, not an alternative location. The phrase ""Spezialkammer"" should be ""special room"" which is correct, but the purpose clause changes the agency from mother to external force

Corrected translation: Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Das Bundesumweltministerium erklärt auf seiner Homepage im Hinblick auf die geltenden Höchstwerte aber, dass eine ""gesundheitliche Gefährdung der Allgemeinbevölkerung"" nicht zu erwarten sei."	"Initial translation: However, the Federal Environment Ministry's website states that it is not expected that the maximum values will be exceeded.

Analysis: The German ""Bundesumweltministerium"" should be ""German Environment Minister"" not ""Federal Environment Ministry"" - the target specifies the minister personally rather than the ministry as an institution. The German content ""dass eine 'gesundheitliche Gefährdung der Allgemeinbevölkerung' nicht zu erwarten sei"" should be ""that a 'health risk to the general population' is not anticipated"" but the model changed this to ""maximum values will be exceeded"" - completely different meaning. The phrase ""auf seiner Homepage"" should be ""on his home page"" not ""website"" to match the personal attribution

Corrected translation: The German Environment Minister, however, declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a ""health risk to the general population"" is not anticipated."	error_correction

Der Bundesvorstand der Juso-Hochschulgruppen forderte, die Gestaltung der Bildungspolitik solle künftig nicht mehr ""hinter verschlossenen Türen"" der Minister und Hochschulrektoren stattfinden."	"Initial translation: The Federal Board of the Juso-University Groups called for education policy to be formulated in future not 'behind closed doors' of ministers and university rectors.

Analysis: The German ""Juso-Hochschulgruppen"" should be ""Young Socialist University Groups"" not ""Juso-University Groups"" - the model failed to translate ""Juso"" properly. The phrase ""die Gestaltung der Bildungspolitik solle künftig nicht mehr"" should be ""the design of education policy should no longer"" not ""education policy to be formulated in future not"" - the model's phrasing is awkward. The word ""Hochschulrektoren"" should be ""university principals"" not ""university rectors"" to match the target terminology. The sentence flow could be more natural

Analysis: The model changed ""Was das wirklich mit mir tut"" (what this really does to me) to ""what was really happening to her,"" personalizing and changing the focus. The phrase should emphasize emotional impact, not events happening TO her. The model also used ""police shooting"" (singular) when ""police shootings"" (plural) is more natural and accurate.

Platz vier bei Olympia lag Biathlet Julian Eberhard lange im Magen."	"Initial translation: Biathlete Julian Eberhard has long been in fourth place at the Olympics.

Analysis: The German idiom ""lag...lange im Magen"" should be ""was sad for a long time"" not literally ""has long been in fourth place"" - this idiom means something bothered/upset someone for a long time. The phrase ""Platz vier bei Olympia"" should be ""about fourth place at the Olympics"" not ""in fourth place"" - this is about being bothered by the result, not currently holding the position. The model took the idiom literally instead of understanding its figurative meaning about lingering disappointment. The temporal context is about past regret, not present ranking

Corrected translation: Biathlete Julian Eberhard was sad for a long time about fourth place at the Olympics."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Hauptveranstalter ist die Vereinigung tschechischer Chöre in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium."	"Initial translation: The main organisers are the Czech Choral Union in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.

Analysis: The German ""Vereinigung tschechischer Chöre"" should be preserved as ""českých pěveckých sborů (Czech Choirs)"" not translated to ""Czech Choral Union"" - the target shows the Czech name should be retained with English translation in parentheses. The phrase ""Hauptveranstalter ist"" should be ""The chief organiser is"" (singular) not ""The main organisers are"" (plural) - this changes the grammatical number. The phrase ""Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium"" should be ""Jan Kepler's Grammar School"" not ""Johannes Kepler Gymnasium"" - the target uses the Czech form of the name and English terminology

Die Masse macht's: Alle zwei Jahre zeigen die Autobauer auf der IAA ihre Neuheiten."	"Initial translation: The masses make it: every two years, the car manufacturers show off their new models at the IAA.

Analysis: The German ""Die Masse macht's"" should be ""The chassis makes the difference"" not ""The masses make it"" - this is a complete misunderstanding where ""Masse"" refers to automotive chassis/body mass, not crowds of people. The phrase ""zeigen...ihre Neuheiten"" should be ""present their new models"" not ""show off their new models"" - ""present"" is more formal and appropriate for trade shows. The model fundamentally misinterpreted the automotive technical context as being about crowd appeal rather than engineering

The phrase ""keine Kosten"" means ""not costing...anything"" and the model omitted ""anything"" which changes the completeness of the statement.

The model completely misunderstood the context which is clearly about doping/drug testing. The word ""bestritt"" means ""said that she had not"" (a specific denial structure) not just ""denied"".

"Initial translation: He can easily get away with a little muscle ache, especially as he has gained a valuable insight into the work of the 'Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder' (Frankfurt) by taking part in the 8th Great Feldberg Ride.

Analysis: The phrase ""wegstecken"" should be ""put up with"" not ""get away with"" - the meaning is about enduring/tolerating, not escaping consequences. The German ""Großen Feldberg"" should be ""Grosser Felberg"" not ""Great Feldberg"" - this appears to be a specific place name that should match the target spelling. The phrase should be ""8th Cycling Event on the Grosser Felberg"" not ""8th Great Feldberg Ride"" to match the target format.

Analysis: The German ""wir wollen Hackebeil"" should be ""we do not want the blades of a guillotine"" not ""we want to see the Hackebeil"" - this is a semantic error where the model missed the negative meaning and left the German word untranslated. The phrase ""sondern eine kollektive Aufgabe"" should be ""but an exercise, joint"" not ""but we want to see a collective effort"" - this is a semantic error where the model added unnecessary repetition. The German ""aus vollem Recht, abgeklärt und stetig"" should be ""serene and ongoing"" not ""rightly so, and continuously"" - this is a lexical error where the model mistranslated ""abgeklärt"" (serene/composed) and changed the structure

"Initial translation: The CSSD has proposed that it will solve the flow of money solomonically - it will take the dividends from CEZ shares, in which the State is the majority shareholder, and will then put the money into the transport funds.

Analysis: The German ""den Abfluss von Geld salomonisch löst"" should be ""that the deficit be resolved Solomon-style"" not ""solve the flow of money solomonically"" - this is about resolving a deficit, not managing cash flow. The phrase ""greift die CEZ-Aktiendividenden an"" should be ""it should draw on ČEZ dividends"" not ""will take the dividends"" - this is about utilizing resources, not taking them. The phrase ""aus diesen dann das Geld in den Verkehrsfonds ausgeschüttet werden"" should be ""and use those to top up the transport fund"" not ""put the money into the transport funds"" - singular fund, not plural

The word ""Zerlegen"" should be ""carved"" not ""splitting"" - this refers to meat carving, not wood splitting. The phrase ""Handarbeit"" should be ""by hand"" not ""manual process"" for better flow.

Analysis: The German ""stimmabgebenden Unternehmern"" in this context should be ""votes"" not ""companies that voted"" - the target treats this as vote count rather than company count. The phrase ""So entschied"" should be ""It was chosen by"" not ""decided in favour"" - different agency and structure.

Analysis: The German ""Höchstaufwand"" was mistranslated as ""maximum effort"" when it should be ""large billboards"" based on the context of a visual advertising project. The phrase ""Fasen"" (phases) was correctly translated but the model missed that these should be ""three different phases"" according to the reference. The verb ""einnehmen"" was translated as ""include"" instead of ""dominate"", significantly weakening the impact description.

Analysis: The German ""Am bayerischen Papst arbeiten sich ja viele, die ihn nie verstanden haben, noch immer eifrig ab"" was misunderstood - ""sich an jemandem abarbeiten"" means ""slaving away at understanding/analyzing someone,"" not ""working to get rid of"" them. The model interpreted this as wanting to remove the Pope rather than continuing to struggle with understanding him. The phrase ""bayerischen Papst"" should be ""Bavarian Pope"" (referring to Pope Benedict XVI), and the meaning is about ongoing intellectual effort to understand him, not opposition

Analysis: The German sentence structure is completely changed - the model makes Deka Bank the subject who talks about consolidation, but the target means ""it's not the first time that the name Deka Bank crops up"" in discussions. The phrase ""ist...die Rede"" means ""the name crops up"" not ""is...to talk about"" - passive vs active construction. The phrase ""die zu den wichtigeren Arbeitgebern am Finanzplatz Frankfurt zählt"" (one of the more significant employers in the financial center of Frankfurt) is mostly omitted from the prediction. The phrase ""wenn es um Konsolidierung...geht"" should be ""in the context of...consolidation"" not just about talking

Analysis: The German sentence is about seeing someone's face/image on food packaging (""mug shots on jars""), but the model translated it literally as him physically standing on a plate. The phrase ""mit dem Fuß in Schalen"" doesn't mean ""standing on a plate"" but refers to his image appearing on containers. The context is about celebrity endorsements on food products, not physical presence. The word ""Gebäck"" means ""biscuits"" not ""cakes"".

The phrase ""beide...Schwestern"" in the target indicates this is specifically about female siblings in fashion. The grammatical agreement should be feminine throughout.

Hingegen fordert der Gründer der Dienstleistungsgruppe laut Familienprotokollen das Nutzungsrecht über 51% des Kapitals."	"Initial translation: On the other hand, according to the family protocols, the founder of the services group is demanding 51% of the capital.

Analysis: The German ""Nutzungsrecht"" (usufruct - legal right to use something) was completely omitted and simplified to just ""demanding 51% of the capital"" when it should be ""claims...the usufruct on 51% of the capital"" - this is a significant legal concept that was lost. The word ""Familienprotokollen"" was translated as ""family protocols"" but the reference uses ""familiar protocols"" - this might be a transcription issue or different interpretation.

Analysis: The German ""Erfindungsgabe"" means ""wittiness/inventiveness"" not ""invention"" - it's about cleverness, not creating something new. The phrase ""Regelumgebung"" appears to mean ""law fraud"" in this context, not ""regulation"" - this seems to be about bending rules fraudulently. The model missed the legal/fraud context entirely. The word ""verwischt"" means ""diffuse"" not ""blurred"" in this context. The translation appears incomplete compared to the target

"Translate the following German to English:
Hier gab es noch Reserven"", meinte P. K. Subban, einer der Abwehrspieler."	"Initial translation: There were still reserves', said P. K. Subban, one of the defencemen.

Analysis: The German ""Hier gab es noch Reserven"" was completely misunderstood - it should be ""That was our weakness"" not ""There were still reserves"" - the semantic meaning is opposite. The word ""Reserven"" in this sports context means ""weakness"" or ""room for improvement,"" not literal reserves. The punctuation is also wrong with a single quote instead of proper quotation marks. The grammatical structure ""einer der Abwehrspieler"" should be ""a defender"" not ""one of the defencemen"" for more natural English

Corrected translation: ""That was our weakness,"" a defender, P. K. Subban added."	error_correction

"Translate the following German to English:
Doch soll die Landespolitik in Großwallstadt nicht unter den Tisch fallen."	"Initial translation: However, the local policy in Großwallstadt must not be under the table.

"Translate the following German to English:
Es sind Elemente einer regionalen Zusammenarbeit, aber einer regionalen Zusammenarbeit, die eine große politische und auch humanitäre Bedeutung hat."

Wie bereits am Donnerstag gab es kein Menschengewühl auf den Bahnsteigen, da sich die Bewohner der Île-de-France auf die Situation eingestellt hatten."	"Initial translation: As was the case on Thursday, there was no crush on the platforms, because the people of Île-de-France had understood the situation.

Analysis: The German ""Menschengewühl"" was translated as ""crush"" when the reference uses ""trouble with crowds"" - ""crush"" is more physical/dangerous while the context suggests general crowding issues. The phrase ""Bewohner der Île-de-France"" was correctly kept as ""people of Île-de-France"" but the reference translates this as ""Parisians"" - a more natural localization. The German ""sich auf die Situation eingestellt hatten"" means ""had adapted/adjusted to the situation"" but was translated as ""had understood the situation"" rather than ""had gotten themselves organised"" - this misses the proactive adaptation aspect

Corrected translation: As on Thursday, there was no trouble with crowds on the platforms, as Parisians had gotten themselves organised."	error_correction

Trendsport-Wochenende, das hieß bislang, dass BMXer und Skateboarder voll auf ihre Kosten kommen."	"Initial translation: Trendsport-Wochenende, which used to mean that BMXers and skateboarders were paying for it all.

Analysis: The German ""voll auf ihre Kosten kommen"" should be ""has been a boon for"" not ""were paying for it all"" - this idiom means to get their money's worth/benefit fully, not to pay expenses. The term ""Trendsport-Wochenende"" should be translated as ""Trendsport weekend"" not left in German. The phrase ""das hieß bislang"" should be ""Up until now"" not ""which used to mean"" for clearer temporal reference. The model completely reversed the meaning from benefiting to paying costs

Corrected translation: Up until now, the Trendsport weekend has been a boon for BMX and skateboard enthusiasts."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Beim Mittagessen, also dem Hauptgericht, siegten Teigwaren knapp vor Geflügel."	"Initial translation: At lunch, the main course, the poultry was just pipped at the post by the cereals.

Analysis: The German ""Teigwaren"" should be ""pasta"" not ""cereals"" - ""Teigwaren"" specifically refers to pasta/noodle products, not grain cereals. The phrase ""siegten Teigwaren knapp vor Geflügel"" should be ""pasta won very tightly over poultry"" not ""poultry was just pipped at the post by cereals"" - the model reversed the winner and changed the food category completely. The structure should show pasta as the winner, not poultry as the near-winner

Corrected translation: As the main dish for lunch, pasta won very tightly over poultry."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Mit dieser Frage hat sich ""Autopapst"" und Wirtschaftsprofessor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer beschäftigt."	"Initial translation: This issue has been addressed by 'Auto-Pope' and Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.

Analysis: The German ""Autopapst"" should be kept as ""Autopapst"" in quotes since it's a specific German nickname, not translated as ""Auto-Pope"". The phrase ""Wirtschaftsprofessor"" means ""Professor of Economics"" not just ""Professor"" - the field specification was omitted. The German sentence structure ""Mit dieser Frage hat sich... beschäftigt"" should be ""On this issue have been working"" not ""This issue has been addressed by"" - the German emphasizes the ongoing work

Neben der Einstellung der Steife der Federleisten werden auch spezielle flexible Schultermodule geboten."	"Initial translation: In addition to the stiffening of the spring, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.

Analysis: The German ""Federleisten"" was translated as ""spring"" when it should be ""slats"" in this bedding/furniture context. ""Einstellung der Steife"" means ""adjusting the stiffness"" not ""stiffening,"" and the model missed that this is about bed slat adjustment. The phrase ""shoulder cradle"" was translated literally as ""shoulder modules"" instead of understanding it as the specific product name ""shoulder cradle

Corrected translation: In addition to adjusting the stiffness of slats you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle."	error_correction

""Wenn sie den ins Ziel bringen, kann so ein Spiel schon mal kippen"", weiß Büring aus jahrelanger Erfahrung."	"Initial translation: 'If they can pull it off, it could be a game-changer', says Mr Büring, with years of experience.

Analysis: The German phrase ""ins Ziel bringen"" means ""bring it to the finish"" literally (completing something) not ""pull it off"" which is too colloquial. The phrase ""kann so ein Spiel schon mal kippen"" means ""such a game can tip over quite easily"" referring to how games can change direction, not ""could be a game-changer"" which is a different metaphor. The word ""weiß"" means ""knows"" not ""says"" - it's about knowledge from experience, not a quote. The model added ""Mr"" to ""Büring"" unnecessarily

Corrected translation: If you bring it to the finish, such a game can also tip over quite easily, Büring knows from years of experience."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Am 11. August hatte François Richier ihr anvertraut: ""selbstverständlich wissen wir nicht, ob die Syrier was auch immer gemacht haben""."	"Initial translation: On 11 August, François Richier said to her: 'of course we do not know what the Syrians have done'.

Analysis: The German ""ihr anvertraut"" means ""confided to him/her"" but was simplified to ""said to her"" losing the sense of confidential disclosure. The phrase ""was auch immer"" (whatever/anything) was translated as ""what"" rather than ""anything"" which is less open-ended. Most critically, the reference translation includes additional French text ""bien sûr, nous ne savons pas si les Syriens ont fait quoi que ce soit"" which appears to be the original French quote that the German was translated from - this suggests the model missed important context or source material that should have been included

Corrected translation: On 11 August, François Richier confided him that the French did not of course know whether the Syrians had done anything.. ""bien sûr, nous ne savons pas si les Syriens ont fait quoi que ce soit."""	error_correction

"Translate the following German to English:
In Dornhan ist er beim Weihnachtsmarkt und bei der Narrenzunft bereits aufgetreten."	"Initial translation: He has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the carnival in Dornhan.

Analysis: The German ""Narrenzunft"" should be ""Narrenzunft (Fool's Guild event)"" not simply ""carnival"" - this is a specific German cultural institution

"Translate the following German to English:
Rolf Ihmig kürte die Allee in seinem schlagerartigen Lied zur ""Kö von Hiltrup""."	"Initial translation: Rolf Ihmig has written a song about the 'Kö of Hiltrup' which is a bit like a hit.

Analysis: The German ""kürte...zur"" means ""crowned/declared as"" but was misunderstood as simply ""written a song about"" - this loses the sense of designation or proclamation. The word ""Allee"" (avenue) was completely omitted from the translation, and there's no mention of ""Marktalle"" which appears in the reference. The phrase ""schlagerartigen Lied"" (hit-like/folk-like song) was simplified to ""a bit like a hit"" rather than the more specific ""folk-like song"".

"Translate the following German to English:
Auch die Doha-Runde sollte abgeschlossen werden, wobei beide Seiten am Scheitern schuld tragen."	"Initial translation: The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for its failure.

Analysis: The German ""sollte abgeschlossen werden"" should be ""was also expedited"" not ""should also be completed"" - wrong sense of urgency and completion status. The phrase ""wobei beide Seiten am Scheitern schuld tragen"" should be ""although both parties are responsible for the fiasco so far"" not ""with both sides to blame for its failure"" - the German implies ongoing responsibility for current problems, not completed failure. The word ""Scheitern"" should be ""fiasco"" not just ""failure"" - stronger negative connotation. The model treats this as a simple recommendation when the target suggests active expedition despite ongoing problems

Corrected translation: The completion of Doha Trade Round was also expedited, although both parties are responsible for the fiasco so far."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Seines Wissens gebe es aber in Hofheim auch eine Sonntagsleerung."	"Initial translation: I understand that there is also a Sunday clean-up in Hofheim.

Analysis: The German ""Seines Wissens"" should be ""To the best of his knowledge"" not ""I understand"" - this refers to someone else's knowledge, not the speaker's understanding. The phrase ""eine Sonntagsleerung"" should be ""a Sunday collection"" not ""a Sunday clean-up"" - ""Leerung"" in this context refers to garbage/mail collection, not cleaning. The model changed the perspective from third person (his knowledge) to first person (I understand) and misunderstood the type of Sunday service being referenced

Corrected translation: To the best of his knowledge, however, there is a Sunday collection in Hofheim."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Es ist schon fast ein rekurrentes Thema, auf das zwei Mitglieder dieser alt eingesessenen Kaste, die sich im Aufzug treffen, zurückgreifen können."	"Initial translation: It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this old established caste can meet in the lift.

Analysis: The German ""auf das...zurückgreifen können"" should be ""to make use of when"" not just ""that...can meet"" - this is about utilizing a conversational topic, not just meeting. The phrase ""die sich im Aufzug treffen"" should be ""recognize themselves in an elevator"" not ""meet in the lift"" - this is about recognition/identification, not arrangement to meet. The word ""Kaste"" should be ""ancient lineage of elected persons"" not just ""caste"" - the target is more specific about the political context. The model simplified the complex interaction to a basic meeting

Corrected translation: It's almost a recurrent theme to make use of when two members of this ancient lineage of elected persons recognize themselves in an elevator."	error_correction

Analysis: The phrase ""an gleicher Stelle"" (at the same position/venue) was completely omitted. The German ""sprach Klartext"" should be ""spoke in plain text"" rather than ""was very clear"" - this loses the specific idiomatic meaning. The word order and emphasis ""vor allem Joshua Kimmich"" (most notably Joshua Kimmich) was simplified

Corrected translation: Already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, at the same position the most notably in plain text spoke Joshua Kimmich."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Unser Gegner hat mit hohem Risiko aufgeschlagen, aber auch etliche Fahrkarten produziert."	"Initial translation: Our opponent has taken a high risk, but has also produced a number of tickets.

Analysis: The German ""aufgeschlagen"" in sports context means ""served"" (like in tennis/volleyball) not ""taken a high risk"" - it's about serving style. The phrase ""etliche Fahrkarten produziert"" is sports slang meaning ""produced countless penalty cards"" not literal ""tickets"" - ""Fahrkarten"" here refers to yellow/red cards in sports. The model misunderstood both the sports context and the idiomatic language. The tense should also be past ""struck"" not present perfect

Corrected translation: Our opponent struck with a high risk, but also produced countless penalty cards."	error_correction

"Initial translation: Mr Weinert is 'Opa' to his party colleagues and Mr Poche, who was caught out before the elections by party sponsorship machinations, is known as 'Igráček' (a Czech Lego figure).

Analysis: The model omitted the crucial detail about ""Ratsherr"" (Councilor) titles and the distinction between ""freundlich"" vs ""weniger freundlich"" (friendly vs less friendly) nicknames. The phrase ""Machenschaften beim Partei-Sponsoring"" was simplified to ""party sponsorship machinations"" when ""fraud in party sponsorship"" is more precise. The model also omitted ""bekannte tschechische Lego-Figur"" explanation and restructured the sentence, losing the parallel structure of the nicknames

"Initial translation: A survey of restaurants in the centre of town shows that the 17 December evening is the one that brings the providers to their knees.

Analysis: The German ""Bei einer Umfrage in diversen zentral gelegenen Restaurants"" should be ""In a poll made in diverse centric establishments"" not ""A survey of restaurants in the centre of town"" - different scope and terminology. The phrase ""stellt sich heraus, dass der Abend des 17. Dezembers die Anbieter zum Kollaps führt"" should be ""one can see the collapse of reservations for the night of the 17th"" not ""shows that the 17 December evening is the one that brings the providers to their knees"" - the model missed that it's about reservation collapse, not general business failure. The word ""Kollaps"" in this context refers to reservation system breakdown, not metaphorical collapse. The model made the sentence more dramatic than the original

Analysis: The translation is incomplete, missing the opening quotation mark and the word ""A"" at the beginning. The German ""Dickkopf"" should be ""thick head"" not ""stupidity"" - while both are negative traits, ""Dickkopf"" literally means thick head/stubborn head, not stupidity.

Analysis: The German ""Rechtsabbiegespur"" should be ""right-hand turning lane"" not ""legal brake"" - this is a major lexical error where the model completely mistranslated a compound noun. The word ""Rechts"" means ""right"" (direction) not ""legal"", and ""abbiegespur"" means ""turning lane"" not ""brake"". This is a semantic error that completely changes the meaning from road infrastructure to legal/braking concepts.

"Initial translation: The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the quarter-finals of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third division club FC Würzburger Kickers has now been definitively scheduled.

Analysis: The German ""Achtelfinale"" should be ""last 16"" not ""quarter-finals"" - wrong tournament stage (Achtelfinale = round of 16, Viertelfinale = quarter-finals). The phrase ""Bayerischen Fußball Totopokals"" should be ""Bavarian football pools cup"" not ""Bavarian Football Totopokals"" - the German name should be translated to English. The word ""terminiert"" should be ""scheduled"" which the model got correct, but ""definitively"" should be ""finally"" - slightly different emphasis. The word ""Drittligisten"" should be ""third league"" not ""third division"" - different sports terminology

Analysis: The German ""Bei diesem Panorama"" should be translated as ""In light of this"" not ""In this context"", as ""Panorama"" here refers to the overall situation/outlook rather than literal context. The phrase ""Plan 2000E"" was incorrectly expanded to ""2000E vehicle"" when it should remain as ""2000E purchase"" referring to a specific aid plan.

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""konnte Kimmich auch so deuten"" should be ""Kimmich could also interpret...as follows"" not ""could also be interpreted as a sign of Kimmich"" - the model completely changed who is doing the interpreting and what is being interpreted. The phrase ""das Zeichen vom Coach"" should be ""the signal from the coach"" not ""the coach's sign"" - ""signal"" is more specific than ""sign

Angst vor einem Gottesstaat am Nil von Gnaden der mächtigen Muslimbruderschaft."	"Initial translation: Fear of a theocratic Egypt, at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.

Analysis: The German ""Gottesstaat am Nil"" means ""God State on the Nile"" not ""theocratic Egypt"" - while similar in meaning, the poetic reference to ""the Nile"" should be preserved. The phrase ""von Gnaden"" means ""at the mercy of"" which was correctly translated. The model also omitted ""They are fearful of"" which provides the subject and makes the sentence more complete.

Analysis: The German ""vom Vermögen etwas üppiger ausgestattet ist"" should be ""rather better off in terms of assets"" not ""with a little more money"" - this is more formal and specific to assets rather than just money. The phrase ""eine Klientel"" should be ""clientele who were"" not ""a clientele"" - the grammar and number agreement should match the target.

"Initial translation: Milinkewitsch said that 'with the country's debt and the trade deficit increasing, it is only a matter of time before the'social security' that is reminiscent of a cemetery begins to crack'.

Analysis: The German ""Dank der Verschuldung des Landes"" should be ""Owing to the indebtedness of the country"" not ""with the country's debt"" - different grammatical structure and formality. The phrase ""an die Stille eines Friedhofes gemahnende"" should be ""similar to dead silence"" not ""that is reminiscent of a cemetery"" - the emphasis is on silence, not the cemetery itself. The word ""zu bröckeln beginnt"" should be ""break-down"" not ""begins to crack"" - different process description. The attribution structure should be ""Milinkevich claimed"" at the end, not ""Milinkewitsch said that"" at the beginning. The model made the sentence more complex than needed

Analysis: The phrase ""vereinsame man auch im Dolce Vita"" should be ""you can even become lonely when living the dolce vita"" not ""even the Dolce Vita is not enough"" - this is about loneliness despite a good lifestyle, not inadequacy of lifestyle. The phrase ""gibt die Fachbuchautorin Aussiedlungswilligen zu bedenken"" should be ""added the author, providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad"" not just ""says the author of the specialist book"" - the model omitted the specific audience (those wanting to emigrate) and the advisory nature

The phrase ""Ein Traumwetter"" should be ""perfect weather"" not ""A dream weather"" - grammatical issue with article and word choice. The phrase ""Tennisabteilung"" should be ""tennis division"" not ""tennis section"" - different organizational terminology.

The phrase ""wie daraus einmal ein schmackhaftes Getränk werden sollte"" should be ""how a tasty drink was to be made from it"" not ""how it would taste one day"" - completely different meaning from the process of making a drink to just tasting something.

"Initial translation: The decoder then notes and reads out: 'Throw' for dice, 'lose' as opposed to fixed; 'party' because he has been to Prague and knows about the window-falling.

Analysis: The German ""Verschlüsseler"" should be ""encryptor"" not ""decoder"" - these are opposite roles in cryptography. The phrase ""als Gegensatz zu Fest"" should be ""as opposed to 'solid'"" not ""as opposed to fixed"" - this is about physical properties. The reference suggests ""evidence"" as an alternative to ""Party"" but the model chose ""party"" without the proper context.

The phrase ""legt sich die Schlinge um den Hals"" should be ""puts the noose around his neck"" not ""hangs himself"" - the model jumped to the conclusion rather than describing the action of placing the noose.

Analysis: The German ""in der Nacht zum Mittwoch"" should be ""during Tuesday night"" not ""in the night"" - missing the specific day reference and wrong temporal preposition. The verb ""bricht...durch"" should be ""will break through"" not ""is blowing through"" - wrong tense (future vs. present) and wrong verb (break vs. blow). The phrase ""Auf der Alpennordseite"" should be ""on the northern sides of the Alps"" not ""On the Alpine north side"" - plural vs. singular and more formal structure. The model lost the temporal specificity and changed the meaning from a forecast of wind breaking through to current wind blowing

Corrected translation: The foehn will break through the valleys on the northern sides of the Alps during Tuesday night."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Sie ist wach, sie hört und sieht diesen Jungen, genauso wie sie das Mädchen in der Bank neben sich hört und sieht."	"Initial translation: She is awake, she is listening and she is seeing this young man, just as she is listening and seeing the girl in the bank beside her.

Analysis: The German ""diesen Jungen"" should be ""this boy"" not ""this young man"" to maintain the age distinction. The word ""Bank"" should be ""desk"" not ""bank"" - in this context it refers to a school desk or bench, not a financial institution. The model also made the sentence unnecessarily wordy with ""she is listening and she is seeing"" instead of the simpler ""she sees and hears

Corrected translation: She is awake, she sees and hears this boy, just like she sees and hears the girl at the desk next to her."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
In der Tat wurden sie auch sämtlich durch den Viminal kontrolliert: unter den nach Sofia gereisten befand sich niemand mit einem laufenden Stadionverbotsverfahren."	"Initial translation: Indeed, they were all controlled by the Viminal: no one who went to Sofia had a running stadium ban.

Analysis: The German ""Viminal"" should be ""Ministry of the Interior at Viminale"" not just ""the Viminal"" - the reference provides the full institutional context. The phrase ""laufenden Stadionverbotsverfahren"" should be ""none was banned, none had been forbidden to frequent a stadium"" not ""running stadium ban"" - the reference explains this as both current bans and prohibitions on stadium attendance. The model loses the detail that this involves multiple types of stadium-related restrictions. The word ""kontrolliert"" should be ""had in fact checked them all"" not just ""controlled"" - emphasizing the verification process

Corrected translation: And the Ministry of the Interior at Viminale had in fact checked them all: among those groups going to Sofia none was banned, none had been forbidden to frequent a stadium."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Als Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer in der 70. Minute Robin Westhues fällte, gab es 18 Meter vor dem Gästegehäuse einen indirekten Freistoß für die Platzherren."	"Initial translation: When Chris Naberbäumer of Altenrhein scored in the 70th minute against Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick 18 metres from the guest house.

Analysis: The German ""fällte"" should be ""cut down"" (fouled) not ""scored"" - this completely changes the meaning from a foul to a goal. The place name ""Altenrheine"" was changed to ""Altenrhein

Corrected translation: As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Westhues in minute 70, the home team got an indirect free kick 18 meters away from the goal."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Die Hypo Real Estate müsse nur den Teil verzinsen, den sie auch in Anspruch nehme."	"Initial translation: Hypo Real Estate would only have to pay interest on the part it also takes.

Analysis: The model missed translating ""in Anspruch nehme"" as ""ends up using"" instead of just ""takes

Corrected translation: Hypo Real Estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using, they said."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Das allein funktioniert heute nicht mehr, erklärt Andreas Reinhardt, Geschäftsführer der Modespitze Plauen."	"Initial translation: This is no longer enough, according to Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the Mode Spitzen Plauen.

Analysis: The German ""Das allein funktioniert heute nicht mehr"" should be ""This is no longer the case today"" not ""This is no longer enough"" - ""funktioniert nicht mehr"" means ""no longer works/functions,"" not inadequacy of amount. The company name ""Modespitze Plauen"" should remain as ""Modespitze Plauen"" (one word) not ""Mode Spitzen Plauen"" (separated) - this is a specific company name for a lace manufacturer. The model changed both the meaning and incorrectly split the company name

Corrected translation: This is no longer the case today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of Modespitze Plauen."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Zum diesjährigen ersten Jahrgang dieser speziellen Unterkategorie des Hauptwettbewerbs Vodafon Firma des Jahres meldeten sich Firmen an, für die der Erfolg nicht das einzige langfristige Ziel ist."	"Initial translation: This year's first year of this special category of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition has seen companies entering which are not only successful but also have a long-term vision.

Analysis: The German ""diesjährigen ersten Jahrgang"" should be ""first year of this special subcategory"" not ""This year's first year"" - this is awkward phrasing showing a fluency error. The phrase ""meldeten sich Firmen an"" should be ""companies signed for the competition"" not ""has seen companies entering"" - this is a semantic error in the verb choice. The German ""für die der Erfolg nicht das einzige langfristige Ziel ist"" should be ""for whom success in business is not the only long-term goal"" not ""which are not only successful but also have a long-term vision"" - the model completely changed the meaning from companies where success isn't the only goal to companies that are successful AND have vision

Den Preis für den besten Drink erhält dieser Mix, mit dem ein Kapselhersteller sich präsentiert, nicht zwingend."	"Initial translation: The price for the best drink is not necessarily won by this mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.

Analysis: The German ""Den Preis für den besten Drink erhält dieser Mix...nicht zwingend"" should be ""The mixture getting the prize for the best drink...not compulsory"" not ""The price...is not necessarily won"" - wrong grammatical structure and word choice. The phrase ""mit dem ein Kapselhersteller sich präsentiert"" should be ""presented by a capsule manufacturer"" not ""with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself"" - awkward reflexive construction. The word ""zwingend"" should be ""compulsory"" not ""necessarily"" - different semantic meaning. The model created an overly complex sentence structure when the original is more direct

"Translate the following German to English:
Man hat immer wieder andere Menschen vorm Kopf, die jeweils eine ganz andere Geschichte hinter sich haben."	"Initial translation: People keep coming forward with different stories, each one of them having a different background.

Analysis: The German ""hat...vorm Kopf"" means ""has at the front of their minds"" not ""keep coming forward"" - this is about mental focus, not physical action. The phrase ""Man hat immer wieder andere Menschen"" should be ""One always has other people"" not ""People keep coming"" - different subject and action. The phrase ""die jeweils eine ganz andere Geschichte hinter sich haben"" should be ""who all have totally different histories behind them"" not ""each one of them having a different background"" - the target emphasizes ""histories"" and ""totally different

Analysis: The German ""Gartenschuppen"" means ""garden shed"" not ""greenhouse"" - these are different structures. The phrase ""der einer betroffenen Frau einfiel"" means ""that the affected woman could think of"" not ""that a woman had with the organisation"" - the model misunderstood that this is about what came to mind, not organizational contact. The word ""betroffenen"" indicates she was a sufferer/victim, which was lost. The model added ""in the 1970s"" which doesn't appear in the German source

Für den Moment können die Behörden Gastarbeitern, die beim ersten Mal durch den Test fallen, nur versprechen, dass sie Zeit für einen Sprachgrundkurs erhalten."	"Initial translation: For the time being, the authorities can only promise that they will receive language courses for the first time.

Analysis: The German ""Gastarbeitern, die beim ersten Mal durch den Test fallen"" (migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time) was completely omitted, losing the key subject and context. The phrase ""dass sie Zeit für einen Sprachgrundkurs erhalten"" should be ""to give time to complete a basic language course"" not ""that they will receive language courses for the first time

The word ""Vervollständigung"" is better translated as ""completing"" rather than ""completion"" in this context.

Es zeigt, dass der Filter nicht gelbgesichtig ist, sondern dass das Gelbgesicht ins abwertende Extrem gezogen wurde."	"Initial translation: It shows that the filter is not yellow-tinted but that the yellow-tint has been taken to the extreme.

Analysis: The German ""gelbgesichtig"" and ""Gelbgesicht"" refer to ""yellowface"" (the racist practice of portraying Asian characters with yellow makeup) but the model translated this as ""yellow-tinted"" and ""yellow-tint"" which completely misses the cultural and racist connotations. This is a critical semantic error that transforms a discussion about racist representation into a technical discussion about color filters

Ihr Mode-Interesse hat Breit von ihrer Mutter in die Wiege gelegt bekommen."	"Initial translation: Her interest in fashion has been passed down from her mother.

Analysis: The German idiom ""in die Wiege gelegt bekommen"" means ""got from her mother when she was still in the cradle"" - it's about receiving something from birth. The model omitted the crucial ""cradle"" metaphor which emphasizes this was inherited from the very beginning of life. The phrase ""von ihrer Mutter"" should be ""from her mother"" (correct) but the timing aspect ""in die Wiege"" (into the cradle) was completely lost

Corrected translation: Breit got her interest in fashion from her mother, when she was still in the cradle."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""irgendwelche Videos"" should be ""I do not know what videos"" not ""some videos"" - the speaker is emphasizing uncertainty about the content. The phrase ""aufs E-Mail geschickt"" should be ""to the email"" not ""by e-mail"" to match the target's phrasing. The ending ""so ein Mist"" should be part of the speaker's frustration in the quote, and the target preserves the stream-of-consciousness flow better than the model's punctuated version.

Analysis: The German meaning about U:fon's creation demonstrating that operators can work together is reversed - the model says the cooperation shows U:fon was worthwhile, but the target says U:fon's difficult creation proves operators can cooperate when needed. The phrase ""wenn es um etwas geht"" should be ""when something is important to the operators"" not ""when it comes to something

Corrected translation: The tug-of-war surrounding the creation of U:fon attests to the fact that when something is important to the operators, they are able to pull for the same team."	error_correction

Und ganz vorne auf der Tribüne wehte einsam eine große Fahne mit Aufschrift ""Sektion Stadionverbot""."	"Initial translation: And at the front of the stand, all alone, was a large banner saying 'Section Stadionverbot'.

Analysis: The German ""wehte"" means ""blew in the wind"" but was completely omitted - this verb describes the flag's movement which adds visual detail. The word ""Fahne"" should be ""flag"" not ""banner"" - these are different objects with different connotations. The phrase ""Sektion Stadionverbot"" should be translated as ""Stadium Ban Section"" rather than left partially in German. The model lost the dynamic imagery of the flag moving in the wind

Beide Mannschaften kombinierten langwierig und so wurde vor allem um die Mittellinie gespielt."	"Initial translation: Both teams played a long ball game and the midfield was the area where most of the action was.

Analysis: The German ""kombinierten langwierig"" was mistranslated as ""played a long ball game"" when it should be ""found it difficult to join in the combination"" - this misses the difficulty aspect entirely. The phrase ""vor allem um die Mittellinie gespielt"" should be ""the game remained around the mid-field line most of the time"" not ""the midfield was the area where most of the action was"" - the original implies stagnation, not action.

Analysis: The German ""Land in Sonne"" should be preserved as ""Land in Sonne"" not translated to ""Land in the Sun"" - this is a proper name that should be kept in the original. The phrase ""Kleingärtner der Anlage"" should be ""allotment holders of the...facility"" not ""gardening scheme"" - the target uses more specific terminology. The word ""belegen"" should be ""occupy"" not ""farmed"" - this is about occupation/usage, not farming

Analysis: The German ""Aufsichtsrats"" was incorrectly translated as ""Supervisory Board"" when it should be ""Committee"" in this media context. The phrase ""infrage stehenden Folgen"" was translated as ""consequences"" but should be ""episodes in question"" - this is about TV episodes, not consequences. The phrase ""ein empfindliches Thema... angeschnitten hätten"" should be ""approached a delicate subject"" not ""would have been a sensitive issue"" - this changes the meaning from describing how something was approached to hypothetical consequences

The email domain should be ""gmail.com"" not ""gmx.de"" according to the target. The phrase ""dann klingt das schon sehr nach Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant und Konsorten"" (sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and the like) was replaced with ""he is definitely a romantic comedy in the making"" which loses the specific actor references.

Analysis: The phrase ""sah es... nach Regen aus"" means ""it looked like rain"" not ""saw that... of rain"" - this is about weather threatening, not actual rain. The subject ""es"" should be clearer in English. The phrase ""40 Minuten Wartezeit"" means ""waiting longer than 40 minutes"" not ""40 minutes of rain"". The model added ""and storm the house"" which appears to be additional content not in the German source. The structure should emphasize the rain threat during waiting time

The phrase ""mit viel Liebe erziehen"" should be ""educate him with bigger love"" not just ""love"" - the word ""bigger"" is specifically mentioned in the target. The grammatical structure places an unnecessary comma after ""will"" and changes the person reference incorrectly.

"Initial translation: Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós, in exchange for which he is to promise to postpone the Congress to the autumn of 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.

Analysis: The German ""vorzuverlegen"" means ""to bring forward/advance"" but was translated as ""postpone"" - this is the opposite meaning, changing from moving the congress earlier to moving it later. The phrase ""für...zu bürgen"" means ""to speak for/vouch for"" but was translated as ""guarantee"" which is less precise about advocacy vs financial guarantee. The word ""Parteispitze"" (party leadership) was correctly translated while the reference uses ""cupola"" (a more architectural metaphor).

Ab heute wird die Maßnahme gegen die jene Schlaumeier in Kraft treten, die erst abstempeln und dann während der Arbeitszeit Kaffeetrinken gehen."	"Initial translation: From today, the measure against those who stamp and then go off to drink coffee during working hours will come into force.

Analysis: The German ""Schlaumeier"" should be ""crafty skivers"" not omitted - this specific term for people who game the system is missing. The opening ""Ab heute"" should be ""But as from today, a new measure starts"" not just ""From today"" - missing the contrasting conjunction and ""new

Obwohl das Gericht die Zulässigkeit der von Frau Bettencourt-Meyers eingeleiteten Klage prüfen müsste, haben die Plaidoyers der Anwälte am Freitag zu einem großen Familiendebakel geführt."	"Initial translation: Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the complaint by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings on Friday led to a huge family debacle.

Analysis: The German ""Plaidoyers der Anwälte am Freitag zu einem großen Familiendebakel geführt"" misses the nuanced meaning - the reference shows this wasn't just a ""debacle"" but ""proceedings into an unveiling of intimate family matters"" indicating exposure of private affairs rather than just chaos. The phrase ""have...geführt"" should be ""at times turned proceedings into"" not ""led to"" - the reference shows this as a transformation of the legal proceedings themselves. The temporal reference ""As the court on Friday was due to examine"" is more precise than ""Although the court would have to examine

Corrected translation: As the court on Friday was due to examine the admissibility of the case brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleas from the lawyers at times turned proceedings into an unveiling of intimate family matters."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Und ""wenn Großbritannien Morgen diesen Freibrief gewährt, ist dies meiner Meinung nach erledigt."""	"Initial translation: And 'if Britain grants a free pass tomorrow, I think it is done.'

Analysis: '""
The model misunderstood the semantic context - the German describes a negative scenario where Britain denying the safe-conduct would end things, but the translation suggests Britain granting something positive.  ""Freibrief"" was translated as ""free pass"" when ""safe-conduct pass"" is more precise in this context.  The temporal element ""Morgen"" (tomorrow) was kept but the conditional logic was reversed.  The phrase ""he felt that"" from the target was omitted in the model's interpretation

Auffällig ist, dass in den letzten Wochen geradezu die klassischen Bürgergruppen die größte Distanz zur CSU äußerten: die freien Berufe, das gewerbliche Bürgertum und Wähler mit Abitur wie Hochschulabschluss."	"Initial translation: It is striking that in recent weeks, it is precisely the traditional citizen groups that have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the self-employed, the middle class and the voters with a high school or university degree.

Analysis: The German ""freien Berufe"" means ""liberal professions"" but was translated as ""the self-employed"" which is less specific - liberal professions refers to professional services like doctors, lawyers, etc. The phrase ""gewerbliche Bürgertum"" means ""commercial/industrial middle class"" but was simplified to just ""middle class"" losing the economic specificity. The term ""Abitur"" is specifically the German secondary school leaving certificate but was generalized to ""high school"" degree. The model's translation is more accessible but loses precision about German social and educational categories

Von dort geht es zum Flugplatz, bis zur Natter und über den Waldhof wieder zurück zum Wasserreservoir."	"Initial translation: From there it is to the airport, to the snake and through the wood to the water reservoir.

Analysis: The German ""Flugplatz"" should be ""airfield"" not ""airport"" - these are different types of aviation facilities. The phrase ""bis zur Natter"" should be ""to the Natter interceptor"" not ""to the snake"" - ""Natter"" is a proper noun referring to a specific aircraft/interceptor, not the German word for snake. The phrase ""über den Waldhof"" should be ""over Waldhof farm"" not ""through the wood"" - this is a specific place name, not a generic forest. The word ""wieder zurück"" meaning ""then back"" was omitted. The model consistently misinterpreted proper nouns as common nouns

Freie Betten an allen Winterterminen bietet immer stets auch das Reisebüro Ingtours in Vrchlabi an."	"Initial translation: Free beds are always available at all winter terms at the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi.

Analysis: The German ""Freie Betten"" should be ""vacancies"" not ""Free beds"" - in tourism context, this is about room availability, not literal beds. The phrase ""an allen Winterterminen"" should be ""throughout the winter"" not ""at all winter terms"" - the target is more natural. The structure ""bietet immer stets auch"" should be ""is still offering"" not ""are always available"" - the emphasis is on the agency's continued service.

The phrase ""gewinnen die Kosmonauten Routine"" should be ""cosmonauts practice skills"" not ""are gaining routine"" - this is about skill practice, not developing habits.

Analysis: The German ""Vorsitzende"" should be ""chairman"" not ""President"" - this is about corporate leadership, not political office. The phrase ""anzutreten, auf alles einzuschlagen"" should be ""coming in, crashing around"" not ""dare to take on everything"" - this is about aggressive action, not just taking responsibility. The word ""auseinanderzunehmen"" should be ""dismantling"" not ""try to change"" - this is about destruction, not reform. The phrase ""sich dabei selbst vielleicht um seinen Job bringt"" should be ""in case they put themselves out of a job in the process"" not ""risking his own job"" - the target is more specific about the consequence

"Initial translation: The perpetrators must have fled after the attack towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and must have fled from the gravel car park opposite the entrance to Parkhaus to the B 256 (Schladernring).

Analysis: The model omitted ""gerannt"" (run) which describes how they moved towards Gerberstraße - this detail about running is present in the reference ""must have run towards"". The phrase ""multi-storey car park"" was shortened to just ""Parkhaus"" without translation, making it less accessible to English readers. The word ""Schotterparkplatz"" was correctly translated as ""gravel car park"". The sentence structure is somewhat repetitive with ""fled"" used twice, while the reference varies this better. However, the model captured most of the complex directional information

Corrected translation: After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße along Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and then fled, possibly towards the B 256 (Schladern ring road) in the silver car from the Schotterparkplatz opposite the entrance to the multi-storey car park."	error_correction

The phrase ""nicht kalt lassen"" should be ""not be able to be indifferent"" not ""sit idly by"" - while similar in meaning, the target uses specific phrasing.

Analysis: The German ""zu passe kommen"" should be ""come in handy"" not ""be able to speak"" - this is about usefulness, not ability. The phrase implies the language would be useful/beneficial, not that they would gain the ability to speak it. The idiom ""zu passe kommen"" means to be convenient or useful, not to gain a skill

The phrase ""Profi- und...Nationalmannschaftskarriere"" was accurately translated but the model used ""professional and...national team career"" while the reference uses ""as a professional and...with the national team"" which flows better.

The phrase ""drei Zelte des Roten Kreuzes daneben"" should be ""three tents"" (with the Red Cross being the one erecting them) not ""three tents next to the Red Cross tents"" - the model misunderstood the relationship and suggests there were already existing Red Cross tents. The word ""Innenbehörde"" should be ""German Internal Affairs Authority"" not just ""Interior Ministry"" - the reference provides more specific institutional context.

Analysis: The translation is incomplete and grammatically broken. The German ""behältst du im Augen"" should be ""you are waiting the release"" not ""you have, in my eyes"" - this is about anticipating film releases, not personal opinion about past work. The phrase ""die Arbeiten, an denen du teilgenommen hast"" should be ""films you acted"" not ""work you have done"" - this specifically refers to acting in films.

Analysis: The German text should be ""They also see green buds in some companies that invite their employees and the grater the volume the better"" - the model completely misunderstood the meaning and added information not present in the German. The phrase ""weshalb die Angestellten wieder eingeladen werden"" doesn't mean ""back to the canteen"" but relates to general employee invitations.

Analysis: The German ""Brücken"" (plural) should be ""bridges"" not ""bridge"" (singular) - there are multiple bridges. The phrase ""Bauhofgebäude"" should be ""construction yard building"" not just ""building"" - missing the specific type. The word ""Sammelweiher"" should be ""lake reservoir"" not ""pond"" - this is a larger water collection facility. The phrase ""einspurig durch eine Ampel geregelt"" should be ""single-lane and regulated by lights"" not ""one-way through a traffic light"" - single-lane means alternating directions, not permanent one-way flow.

The phrase ""dass meine Schmerzen gelindert werden"" was correctly translated as ""my pain to be alleviated,"" but the target simplifies the second part to just ""I want to be relieved

Corrected translation: But this does not necessarily mean ""I want you to euthanise me,"" it means ""I want to be relieved."""	error_correction

"Translate the following German to English:
Sie sollen zu gleichen Teilen aus der EU, den USA und aus Drittstaaten stammen."	"Initial translation: They are to be equally divided between the EU, the US and third countries.

Analysis: The German ""zu gleichen Teilen"" should be ""in equal proportions"" not ""equally divided"" - proportions is more precise than division. The phrase ""aus...stammen"" should be ""come...from"" not ""be divided between"" - this is about origin, not distribution. The word ""Drittstaaten"" should be ""non-member countries"" not ""third countries"" - this is more specific to EU context where non-member is more accurate than third. The word ""sollen"" should be ""should"" not ""are to be"" to match the target's modal expression

Corrected translation: They should come in equal proportions from the EU, the USA and from non-member countries."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Nach kurzer Zeit gelang es, die erste Person zu finden und ins Freie zu geleiten."	"Initial translation: It was not long before the first person was found and led out into the open.

Analysis: The phrase ""ins Freie zu geleiten"" was translated as ""led out into the open"" when it should be ""direct them out of the building"" - the German suggests guiding someone to safety/outside a building, not just to an open area. The model used ""it was not long before"" which is more literary/formal than the direct ""after a short time"" used in the reference. The translation changes the emergency/rescue context to something more casual

Corrected translation: After a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building."	error_correction

In den nächsten beiden Instanzen bekam Freudenberg zwar recht, doch der Prozessgegner kämpft bis heute weiter."	"Initial translation: In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent of the process is still fighting.

Analysis: The German ""bekam...recht"" should be ""was proven right"" not ""was right"" - the target emphasizes the legal vindication. The phrase ""der Prozessgegner"" should be ""the opposing party"" not ""the opponent of the process"" - more formal legal terminology. The phrase ""kämpft bis heute weiter"" should be ""continues to contest the matter to this day"" not ""is still fighting"" - the target uses more formal legal language

Corrected translation: In the next two instances, Freudenberg was proven right, however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day."	error_correction

Die Regulierungsbehörde NICE des NHS hat eine vier Jahre lange Einnahme empfohlen, um das Risiko kardiovaskulärer Probleme weiter zu reduzieren."	"Initial translation: The NHS NICE regulatory body has recommended a four-year income to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.

Analysis: The German ""Einnahme"" should be ""it should be given to people"" not ""income"" - this is about medication administration, not earnings. The phrase ""Regulierungsbehörde NICE des NHS"" should be ""NHS watchdog NICE"" not ""NHS NICE regulatory body"" - watchdog is the more appropriate term.

Aus dem Publikum hört man: Der Vortrag sei ""opulenter"" und man könne damit die ""Platte im Grunde wegwerfen""."	"Initial translation: The audience is saying that the speech was 'opulent' and that it is 'basically throwing the record out of the window'.

Analysis: The German ""hört man"" should be ""one can hear"" not ""The audience is saying"" - this changes from an impersonal construction to direct attribution. The phrase ""Der Vortrag"" should be ""the performance"" not ""the speech"" - the target suggests this is about a musical performance. The phrase ""man könne damit die 'Platte im Grunde wegwerfen'"" should be ""it makes you want to 'chuck away the album'"" not ""throwing the record out of the window"" - the target is more colloquial and natural

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""sei...unterwandert"" suggests allegations but the model states this as fact. The target begins with ""There are allegations that"" which the model completely omits, changing a reported claim into a factual statement. The phrase ""unterwandert"" should be ""infiltrated"" not ""under the control of"" - infiltration suggests covert influence rather than overt control. The word ""Genpflanzen"" should be ""genetically modified crop"" not ""genetic crops

Analysis: The German ""wobei er seinen Mund weit öffnet, in dem einige Zähne fehlen"" (opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing) was completely omitted. This is significant descriptive detail about the character's appearance. The phrase ""mein ganzes Leben war"" should be ""has been my whole life"" not ""has been my life"" - the ""ganzes"" (whole) is important emphasis.

Es war ein rotes Kleid mit fliegendem Rock und einem drapierten Oberteil mit einem Dekolleté, das seinem Namen Ehre macht."	"Initial translation: It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that did justice to its name.

Analysis: The German ""fliegendem Rock"" should be ""frilly skirt"" not ""flying skirt"" - this is about ruffled/frilly fabric, not airborne movement. The phrase ""drapierten Oberteil"" should be ""draped 'corsage'"" not ""draped top"" - the target uses specific fashion terminology. The phrase ""einem Dekolleté, das seinem Namen Ehre macht"" should be ""a strapless neckline"" not ""a décolleté that did justice to its name"" - the target simplifies and specifies the neckline type.

Analysis: The German ""Die Älbler"" should be ""The Alb men"" not ""The Alblers"" - incorrect demonym formation. The word ""zwar"" was omitted entirely - this should be translated to show contrast. The phrase ""mit einer erfahrenen Mannschaft auf der anderen Netzseite"" should be ""stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team"" not ""had a team of experienced players on the other side"" - missing the emphatic ""undoubtedly"" meaning and the specific ""net"" reference.

"Translate the following German to English:
Aber natürlich muss man erst einmal Freunde haben, damit eine Freundschaft funktionieren kann."	"Initial translation: But, of course, you have to have friends first before you can have a friendship.

Analysis: This misinterprets the German text's meaning.

"Translate the following German to English:
Der Schwachpunkt ist natürlich, wie bei anderen städtischen Schulinspektoren, dass sie versucht, die weiße und schwarze Mittelschicht zu halten."	"Initial translation: The weakness, as with other city inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle classes.

Analysis: The German ""Schwachpunkt"" should be ""the rub"" not ""weakness"" - ""the rub"" is a more idiomatic expression for a problematic aspect. The phrase ""städtischen Schulinspektoren"" should be ""urban superintendents"" not ""city inspectors"" - this refers to education officials, not general inspectors. The phrase ""zu halten"" should be ""hold on to"" not just ""keep"" to convey the struggle/effort involved. The pronoun should be ""she's"" not ""they are"" to match the singular reference

Analysis: The German ""Amtshaftungsklage"" should be ""liability claim"" not ""action for damages"" - this is a specific legal term. The phrase ""das Land Berlin"" should be ""the state of Berlin"" not ""the country of Berlin"" - Berlin is a German state (Bundesland), not a country. The phrase ""unwürdigen Haftbedingungen"" should be ""unsuitable prison conditions"" not ""unworthy conditions of detention"" - more precise legal terminology.

Analysis: The German ""Rechteckschild"" should be ""rectangular shield"" not ""square shield"" - while similar, rectangular is more specific and accurate. The phrase ""Zuerst"" should be ""At first"" not ""First of all"" - the target uses more temporal language. The phrase ""an der Reihe"" should be ""lined up"" not ""in the line-up"" - different construction. The German ""Beinschiene am linken Bein und Armschiene am rechten Arm"" should be ""cuisse on the left leg, and a vembrace on the right arm"" not ""knee-brace and an arm-brace"" - these are specific medieval armor terms that the model simplified

Analysis: The German ""Er zerreißt sich für die Mannschaft"" should be ""He bends over backwards for the team"" not ""He tears himself apart for the team"" - while both convey extreme effort, ""bends over backwards"" is the proper English idiom for making extraordinary effort, while ""tears apart"" is too literal and violent. The phrase ""geht über Schmerzen drüber"" should be ""ignoring any pain"" not ""goes through pain"" - this is about disregarding pain, not experiencing it. The model's version suggests suffering while the reference suggests determination despite discomfort

Corrected translation: He bends over backwards for the team, ignoring any pain."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""Seidenvorhang"" should be ""silk curtain"" not ""veil"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a less precise word. The phrase ""gefangen sehen"" should be ""find ourselves trapped"" not ""be stuck"" - the model simplified the reflexive construction. The German ""aber doch irgendwie verloren"" should be ""but lost souls nonetheless"" not ""but somehow lost"" - the model lost the emphasis and nuance of the original

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""Mit einem solchen Wunsch sollen sich...an den US-Präsidenten gewandt haben"" should be ""Several groups of Sudeten Germans supposedly addressed the president of the USA with a wish of this type"" not ""according to the President"" - the model reversed who is the source of information. The phrase ""sollen sich...gewandt haben"" indicates reported/supposed action, not presidential confirmation. The word ""einige Gruppen"" should be ""Several groups"" not just ""some"" - this loses the group designation. The preposition structure changes the meaning from groups approaching the president to the president being the information source

Analysis: The German text describes a complex situation where ""Premium des Festivals Hay Festival"" should be ""Hay Festival prize"" and the comparison with ""Our mutual friend"" by Dickens is about an ancient edition being part of the prize, not comparing Vargas Llosa to the book. The phrase ""packed the theatre Juan Bravo with fans"" was completely lost and replaced with a simple ""is to be seen at"" which misses the impact and audience enthusiasm. The model misunderstood the relationship between the author, the prize (which included a Dickens book), and the packed theater

Analysis: The grammatical structure ""which it almost collapsed"" is incorrect - should be ""since it nearly collapsed"" with proper temporal sequencing. The phrase ""sich distanziert"" should be ""has retreated from them"" not ""distanced itself from the situation"" - the reference indicates retreating from specific entities/policies, not a general situation. The crucial phrase ""und gerettet werden musste"" (and had to be bailed out) is completely omitted from the model's translation.

The phrase ""ertüchtigt werden"" was translated as ""upgraded"" when ""beefed up"" is the more colloquial equivalent that matches the tone.

"Initial translation: Schöpf, who scored with a header, said: 'We all felt a great sadness, because I am actually the worst header of the ball in the team'.

Analysis: The German ""ein riesiger Stein vom Herzen gefallen"" should be ""felt a huge weight lifted off our shoulders"" not ""felt a great sadness"" - this idiom means relief, not sadness. The phrase ""keinen unwesentlichen Anteil hatte"" should be ""played no insignificant part"" not omitted - this means he played a significant role. The structure should start with the relief quote, then explain Schöpf's role. The word ""Kopfballspieler"" should be ""header"" (player who heads the ball) not ""header of the ball

Corrected translation: We all felt a huge weight lifted off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whose scoring header played no insignificant part: ""And I am actually the worst header on the team."""	error_correction

An diesem Ort blieb er 49 Tage nach einem zweiten Haftbefehl, nachdem der Beamte des Ministerio Público die Straftaten wegen Bestechung und organisierten Verbrechens verworfen hatte."	"Initial translation: He was there 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office, after the Public Prosecutor had rejected the charges of bribery and organised crime.

Analysis: The German ""nach einem zweiten Haftbefehl"" should be ""following the pronunciation of a second restriction order"" not ""after a second arrest warrant"" - the target uses different legal terminology. The phrase ""nachdem der Beamte des Ministerio Público die Straftaten...verworfen hatte"" should be ""after the prosecutor dismissed the crimes"" not ""after the Public Prosecutor had rejected the charges"" - while similar, the target uses ""dismissed"" and ""crimes"" rather than ""rejected"" and ""charges

So wurde das Fest der unbeständigen Witterung ausgesetzt, weshalb zwei von drei Feiern nicht stattfinden konnten."	"Initial translation: The Festival of Unstable Weather was exposed to the elements, so two out of three events could not take place.

Analysis: The German ""das Fest der unbeständigen Witterung ausgesetzt"" doesn't mean there was a ""Festival of Unstable Weather"" - this appears to be a misunderstanding where the model created a festival name from the weather description. The phrase means ""the festival was exposed to unstable weather"" but the model treated ""unbeständigen Witterung"" as part of the festival's name. The reference correctly interprets this as ""The weather was rather fierce against this Festival"" showing weather as the external force, not part of the festival's identity. This is a significant semantic misunderstanding that changes the entire scenario

Corrected translation: The weather was rather fierce against this Festival and prevented two over three celebrations."	error_correction

Die Deutsche Bahn in NRW kündigte an, alles zu tun, um die Auswirkungen möglichst gering zu halten."	"Initial translation: The German Railways in North Rhine-Westphalia announced that they would do everything possible to limit the effects.

Analysis: The German ""Deutsche Bahn in NRW"" should be ""Deutsch Bahn in NW"" not ""The German Railways in North Rhine-Westphalia"" - wrong abbreviation handling and company name translation. The phrase ""alles zu tun, um die Auswirkungen möglichst gering zu halten"" should be ""they will do everything they can to ensure disruptions are kept to a minimum"" not ""they would do everything possible to limit the effects"" - wrong tense (will vs. would), wrong object (disruptions vs. effects), and wrong verb phrase (ensure...kept to minimum vs. limit). The model was too explanatory with the state name and lost the specific focus on ""disruptions

Corrected translation: Deutsch Bahn in NW has announced that they will do everything they can to ensure disruptions are kept to a minimum."	error_correction

Die WM-Loipe in Östersund (SWE) liegt Eberhard: ""Die Strecke habe ich schon ins Herz geschlossen"", erinnert er sich er sich mit Freuden an seinen vierten Weltcupplatz im Einzelrennen im Vorjahr."	"Initial translation: Eberhard is looking forward to the World Cup in Östersund (SWE): 'I have already fallen in love with the course', he recalls with pleasure of his fourth World Cup podium in the individual race last year.

Analysis: The model translated ""liegt Eberhard"" as ""Eberhard is looking forward to"" when it should be ""is Eberhard's"" - the German means the course suits/fits Eberhard, not that he's anticipating it. The phrase ""vierten Weltcupplatz"" should be ""fourth place world cup finish"" not ""fourth World Cup podium"" - ""Platz"" means position/place, not podium (which implies top 3). The model misunderstood the context where Eberhard is explaining why the course works for him based on past experience, not expressing future anticipation. The grammatical structure ""liegt Eberhard"" is a complex construction meaning ""suits Eberhard"" that the model completely misinterpreted

Corrected translation: The world championship cross-country ski run in Östersund, Sweden is Eberhard's: “I have already taken the track to heart,” he says as he happily remembers his fourth place world cup finish in the individual race last year."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""Es gab erhebliche Überschreitungen"" was translated as ""significant overruns"" while the reference uses ""considerable infringements"" - both could be correct depending on context (budget overruns vs rule violations). However, the model completely omitted the second part of the sentence ""der sich selbst mal vor Ort über die Lage kundig machte"" (who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on) - this is significant contextual information about King's personal investigation that was entirely lost. The omission removes important credibility information about King's firsthand knowledge

Vergrämung sei nur als Ausnahme an Krankenhäusern, Altersheimen oder Schulen denkbar."	"Initial translation: Sadness is only possible in hospitals, old people's homes and schools.

Analysis: The German ""Vergrämung"" should be ""Deterrence"" not ""Sadness"" - this refers to deterring/scaring away (likely animals or pests), not emotional sadness. The phrase ""sei nur als Ausnahme denkbar"" should be ""would only be conceivable as an exception"" not ""is only possible"" - the conditional mood is important. The phrase ""Altersheimen"" should be ""retirement homes"" not ""old people's homes"" for more respectful language.

"Translate the following German to English:
Diese Lebensfreude strahle bereits Herr Li aus, schmeichelte er dem Gastgeber."	"Initial translation: This joy of life is already shining through Mr Li, he told the host.

Analysis: The German ""Lebensfreude"" should be ""zest for like"" not ""joy of life"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a more common expression but the reference has a typo (""like"" should be ""life""). The phrase ""strahle bereits Herr Li aus"" should be ""already beams out of Mr Li"" not ""is already shining through Mr Li"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the direction of the beaming. The German ""schmeichelte er dem Gastgeber"" should be ""he said flattering the host"" not ""he told the host"" - this is a semantic error where the model missed the flattering aspect of the speech

The phrase ""seit kurzem"" should be ""now"" not ""for some time now"" - this indicates recent action, not extended duration. The phrase ""nach Angaben der Behörde"" should be ""According to officials there"" not ""It is said...by the authorities"" which is more indirect.

Analysis: The model translated ""Schweizer Wiese"" literally as ""Swiss Meadows"" when it should remain as the proper name ""Schweizer Wiese"" in quotes. The German ""Bauzaun"" means ""hoarding"" (construction barrier) not just ""fence

Analysis: The German ""Eigenartige Mischungen"" should be ""Strange mashups"" not ""Strange mixtures"" - the target uses more contemporary terminology. The phrase ""wurden ausprobiert"" should be ""were tried"" not ""were tried out"" - more concise. The phrase ""da eine kalorienreiche und nährhafte Befriedigung Vorrang...hatte"" should be ""as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent"" not ""because...satisfaction was preferred"" - different causal structure and ""fulfillment"" vs ""satisfaction

Analysis: The German phrase ""in Schwierigkeiten geratenen"" should be ""troubled"" not ""in difficulties"" - more concise.

The German ""Abfertigungen, die im Übersee-Slang salopp 'Golden Handshake' genannt werden"" should be ""severance - which is simply called golden parachute in the overseas slang"" but the model omits the explanation and uses ""golden handshakes"" instead of ""golden parachute

Analysis: The German ""Es ist genial"" should be ""It is ingenious"" not ""It is wonderful"" - different intensity and connotation. The phrase ""unser Körper"" should be ""our bodies"" (plural) not ""our body"" (singular). The phrase ""zollen den Spendern Respekt"" should be ""show respect to the donors"" not ""pay tribute to those"" - ""donors"" is more specific than ""those

The phrase ""die die Vereinbarungen über die Mieterhöhung unterschreiben"" should be ""who sign the agreement to increase rents"" not ""who sign the agreements on rent increases"" - subtle difference in preposition and singular/plural.

Analysis: The German ""ließ sich einen zusätzlichen Dank nicht nehmen"" should be ""refused to part without offering additional thanks"" not ""was not about to let us off lightly"" - this is a major semantic error where the model completely changed the meaning from offering thanks to being strict. The phrase ""Vorsitzende"" should be ""chairwoman"" not ""Chair"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a less specific term.

The phrase ""anspringen"" should be ""latch on to"" not ""jump on"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a more literal translation. The German ""auf die wir Menschen so gerne anspringen"" carries the meaning of being attracted to sensational news, not literally jumping on disasters.

The phrase ""lagen zugedeckt auf einem Tisch"" should be ""were placed, covered, on a table"" not ""were underwritten on a table"" - ""zugedeckt"" means covered/concealed, not financially underwritten. The phrase ""humorvoll umschrieben"" should be ""humorously paraphrased"" not ""jokingly written out"" - this means described in humorous, indirect ways before revealing

Ansonsten bleibt nichts anderes übrig, als die Roste in unterschiedlicher Höhe zu montieren und das ist längst nicht bei jedem Bettrahmen möglich."	"Initial translation: Otherwise, there is nothing else to do but to mount the rust in different places and this is not possible in every bed frame.

Analysis: The German ""Roste"" means ""slatted bases"" (bed slats) but was translated as ""rust"" - this is a critical vocabulary error that changes from furniture assembly to metal corrosion. The phrase ""in unterschiedlicher Höhe"" means ""at different heights"" but was translated as ""in different places"" which loses the specific height adjustment aspect. The reference correctly identifies these as ""slatted bases into different heights"" which makes sense for bed construction, while the model's version about mounting rust makes no practical sense.

""So sind sie viel stärker eingebunden und es ist für die Kitaleitung einfacher, pädagogische Konzepte umzusetzen""."	"Initial translation: They are much more involved and it is easier for the Kitaleadership to implement educational concepts.

Dieser sympathische und intelligente, aber vom Leben gestrafte junge Mann könnte als Touristenführer, Kellner oder am Empfang eines Hotels arbeiten, aber stattdessen verrichtet er die Arbeit eines Tragesels."	"Initial translation: This sympathetic and intelligent young man, who has been punished by life, could work as a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he is a donkey.

Analysis: The phrase ""verrichtet er die Arbeit eines Tragesels"" should be ""he does the work of a mule"" not ""he is a donkey"" - the model lost the distinction between being something versus doing the work of something. The reference ""Punished for life"" better captures the permanent nature of ""vom Leben gestrafte"" compared to ""who has been punished by life"" which sounds more temporary. The word ""Tragesel"" should be ""mule"" not ""donkey"" - mules are specifically work animals, while donkeys are more general. The model's ending makes it sound like the person transformed into an animal rather than performing animal-like labor

Corrected translation: Punished for life, this pleasant, intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule."	error_correction

"Initial translation: The film starts and I am reminded that I am a long way from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.

Analysis: The German ""es kommt mir in den Sinn"" should be ""it occurs to me"" not ""I am reminded"" - different meaning. The phrase ""ein simuliertes Gähnen und eine Armeslänge"" should be ""a fake yawn and an arm stretch"" not omitted from ""I am a long way from"" - the model loses the specific imagery.

Analysis: The German ""Tutor"" should be ""don"" not just ""tutor"" - this is a specific academic title. The phrase ""(mittlerweile verstorben)"" (now deceased) was completely omitted. The model added ""my tutor"" and ""to me"" which don't exist in the German text, and changed the quote structure. The word order should preserve the formal academic tone

So öffnete er seine ""Schatzkiste"" und präsentierte den älteren Besuchern den neuesten Federweißen."	"Initial translation: He opened his 'treasure chest' and presented the older visitors with the latest white feather.

Analysis: The German ""Federweißen"" is a specific alcoholic beverage (new wine) that should be translated as ""Federweisser"" with an explanation like ""[alcoholic beverage]"" not literally as ""white feather"". This is a compound word where ""Feder"" doesn't mean feather in this context. The model completely misunderstood this cultural/culinary term.

Wieder umzuschalten auf die Gegenwart ist ein böses Erwachen, als ob man aus einem Traum gerissen wird."	"Initial translation: To wake up again to the present is a bad dream, as if you have been dragged out of a dream.

Analysis: The German ""umzuschalten"" should be ""cutting to"" not ""to wake up again to"" - this is about switching/cutting scenes (like film editing), not waking up. The phrase ""böses Erwachen"" should be ""rude awakening"" not ""bad dream"" - these are opposite concepts (awakening vs staying in dream). The phrase ""als ob man aus einem Traum gerissen wird"" should be ""like snapping out of a dream"" not ""as if you have been dragged out of a dream"" - the target emphasizes sudden breaking

Analysis: The model added ""on Tuesday"" which is not present in the German source but appears in the model's translation. The phrase ""Ein paar Hundert"" was translated as ""A few hundred"" while the reference uses ""several hundred"" which is more formal. The term ""lebendigen Schild"" was translated as ""living shield"" but the reference uses ""live chain"" which better captures the human chain concept. The phrase ""in dem Uran verarbeitet wird"" (in which uranium is processed) was simplified to just naming it as ""nuclear technology centre"" while the reference specifies ""Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility"" which is more precise

Analysis: The model completely omitted the key metaphor ""alle Eier in einen Korb legen"" (putting all eggs in one basket) which is central to understanding the strategy. The phrase ""Anstatt dass alle Kläger sozusagen"" means ""rather than piling all the plaintiffs into this case"" not ""to have a number of claimants"". The model missed the contrast being drawn and the specific imagery. The model also added ""to keep the pressure up"" which doesn't appear in the German source

The phrase ""es handelt sich um eine Art Tatra auf dem Meeresgrund"" should be ""it is a sort of underwater model of the Tatra Mountains"" not ""it is like a Tatra on the sea bed"" - missing the ""underwater model"" concept and the full mountain range reference. The word ""Meeresboden"" appears twice but should be distinguished as ""ocean floor"" and then ""underwater"" in the comparison.

"Initial translation: After the bullfighters announced that the ground of the arena was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival, which was to end the festival in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.

Analysis: The German ""feststellten"" should be ""had assured"" not ""announced"" - different type of communication. The phrase ""wurde...auf gestern Morgen verlegt"" should be ""were suspended yesterday morning"" not ""was moved to yesterday morning"" - suspended vs moved to a new time. The target indicates the bullfights were cancelled/suspended, not rescheduled. The phrase ""mit dem das Fest in Pozoblanco abgeschlossen werden sollte"" should be ""which were to seal the days of the festival"" not ""which was to end the festival"" - different imagery and emphasis

"Initial translation: Since both the timber export and the turn-off worked in the current state of the expansion, Mr Haas argued against the change of the level crossing.

Analysis: The German ""Holzabfuhr"" should be ""transportation of wood"" not ""timber export"" - this is about local wood transport, not international export. ""Abbiegen"" should be ""turning"" not ""turn-off"" - it refers to the turning movement of vehicles, not an exit ramp. ""Ausbauzustand"" should be ""current state"" or ""as things are"" not ""state of the expansion"" - this refers to the existing condition. ""Umbau des Bahnübergangs"" should be ""reconstruction of the railway crossing"" not ""change of the level crossing"" - the scale of work is different

The phrase ""in allen für ihn damals diffizilen Punkten"" should be ""in all points which were dangerous for him at the time"" not ""in all the difficult areas for him"" - ""dangerous"" is stronger than ""difficult"" and the temporal ""at the time"" is more precise.

Ihren Worten zufolge könnte es noch am Sonntag zu einer Endabstimmung kommen."	"Initial translation: According to you, there may be a final vote on Sunday.

Analysis: The German ""Ihren Worten zufolge"" should be ""According to her"" not ""According to you"" - ""Ihren"" is third person feminine (her words), not second person (your words). This is a basic pronoun error that changes who is being quoted. The phrase ""könnte es noch am Sonntag zu einer Endabstimmung kommen"" should be ""the final vote could take place as early as Sunday"" not ""there may be a final vote on Sunday"" - the reference emphasizes the earliness (""as early as"") and uses ""take place"" rather than just existence

Analysis: The German ""Wiese"" is a proper noun (surname) meaning ""Wiese"" (a person's name) not ""meadows"" - this is a complete misunderstanding of the context where charges are being considered against a person named Wiese. The phrase ""angezeigt wird"" should be ""charges are going to be pressed against"" not ""to show"" - this refers to legal charges, not displaying something. The model completely missed that this is about legal proceedings against an individual

The phrase ""für die Verwaltungsgemeinschaft"" should be ""for the joint association of administrations"" not ""for the administrative community"" - more specific terminology. The phrase ""der Bewerber"" should be ""applicants"" (plural) not ""the candidate"" (singular).

The technical term ""Schwarz-System"" was completely omitted, which appears to be the ""Svarc System"" mentioned in the reference - this is likely a specific policy or legal framework that was entirely lost.

Analysis: The German ""Münster"" should be ""cathedral"" not ""Münster"" - this is a named entity error where the model left the German word untranslated when it means cathedral in this context. The phrase ""die am Pilgerziel angekommenen Minis"" should be ""the children who had arrived at the pilgrimage site"" not ""the minis that had arrived from the pilgrimage destination"" - this is a lexical error where ""Minis"" should be ""children"" and the preposition should be ""at"" not ""from"". The German ""von Kooperator Markus Obert begrüßt"" should be ""welcomed by Chaplain Markus Obert"" not omitted - this is an omission error where the model left out who did the welcoming

The phrase ""3,5 Promille"" should be ""3.5 per mille"" not ""3.5%"" - these are different measurements.

Analysis: The German ""freie Objekte"" should be ""Properties are free"" not ""there are free objects"" - in real estate context, ""Objects"" is awkward English while ""Properties"" is the proper term. The phrase ""will seine Wohnung anbieten"" should be ""is prepared to let"" not ""wants to offer his home"" - the reference emphasizes willingness/preparation rather than desire, and ""let"" is the proper British term for renting out property.

Analysis: The German ""altersgerecht"" means ""age-appropriate"" not ""adapted to the needs of the elderly"" - while semantically similar, ""age-appropriate"" is more concise. The word ""Wohnung"" is better translated as ""apartment"" not ""dwelling"" in most contexts. The phrase ""damit barrierefrei"" means ""and therefore barrier-free"" not ""and made accessible"" - the word order and connecting phrase are different. The model added ""even if it is a beautiful dwelling"" which doesn't appear in the German source

Analysis: The place name ""Wolfratshausen"" was incorrectly changed to ""Wolfratshofen"" throughout - this is a different location entirely. The phrase ""Als Vorbild...führte...an"" should be ""As an example...led the project"" not ""was the inspiration for"" - the meaning is that he cited the French project as a model, not that he inspired the German project. The organization name ""Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde"" should be ""Wolfratshausen castle friends"" not ""Wolfratshofen Castle Friends"" due to the location error. The word ""Vorsitzender"" should be ""chairmen"" not ""president"" in this context

""Dann aber ist plötzlich ein Ruck durchs Team gegangen"", fasste Bieletzki die zweite Viertelstunde zusammen."	"Initial translation: However, suddenly, the team has changed tack, as Mr Bieletzki summed up the second half.

Analysis: The German ""ein Ruck durchs Team gegangen"" should be ""a jolt went through the team"" not ""changed tack"" - this loses the specific imagery. The phrase ""die zweite Viertelstunde"" means ""the second quarter-hour"" not ""the second half

Corrected translation: But then suddenly a jolt went through the team, summarized Bieletzki."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""startete"" means ""started out"" not ""was founded"" - this is about beginning activities, not establishment. The phrase ""im Gasthaus 'Leininger'"" was completely omitted - this specifies the location where they started. The word ""Mannschaften"" means ""teams"" (correct) and ""competitions"" is correct but should be ""round-robin competition"" (singular).

"Initial translation: The death of Paul Newman has left cinema-goers in a state of shock this weekend, while on the dark screen of memory all his great roles were played out.

Analysis: The German ""Tod"" should be ""disappearance"" not ""death"" according to the target - this may be using euphemistic language. The phrase ""in Taumel versetzte"" should be ""brought vertigo"" not ""left...in a state of shock"" - ""Taumel"" specifically means dizziness/vertigo.

Mit der Reform des Organgesetzes über den Kongress werde das Zweiparteiensystem eingeführt, beklagen sie."	"Initial translation: They complain that the reform of the Organic Law on the Congress is introducing a two-party system.

Analysis: The German ""beklagen sie"" should be ""they say"" not ""they complain"" - the tone is more neutral reporting than complaining. The phrase ""werde das Zweiparteiensystem eingeführt"" should be ""a 'two-party system' emerges"" not ""is introducing"" - the quotation marks around two-party system are important. The preposition should be ""of Congress"" not ""on the Congress

"Initial translation: This audience is full of dolls' names, such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofía of Habsburg.

Analysis: The German ""Modepuppen"" should be ""mannequins"" not ""dolls"" - this refers to fashion mannequins, not toys. The phrase ""strahlen Namen wie"" should be ""names stand out such as"" not ""is full of dolls' names"" - the names are prominent/glowing, not just present. The structure ""In diesem Publikum"" should be ""In this crowd"" not ""This audience is full of"" which changes the perspective. The model lost the fashion context and made it sound like toys rather than fashion displays

"Translate the following German to English:
Offensiv ""plätscherte alles so ein bisschen"" gegen ein Team, ""das nur verteidigen wollte."	"Initial translation: It was a bit of an offensive 'platitude' against a team that just wanted to defend.

Analysis: The German ""plätscherte alles so ein bisschen"" means ""everything just happened somehow"" or ""everything just trickled along"" - it's about lack of intensity, not a ""platitude"". The word ""plätscherte"" means to trickle or flow gently, indicating weak offensive play. The model misunderstood this as the English word ""platitude"" which is completely different.

Analysis: The German opening ""Vielmehr gibt er zu bedenken"" (He is far more concerned to point out) is completely omitted from the prediction. The phrase ""Kinderkrippe"" should be ""children's nursery"" not ""crèche"" - the target uses English terminology. The phrase ""Anwohner an der Einmündung"" should be ""people who live by the entrance"" not ""residents at the junction"" - more descriptive. The phrase ""benachbarten Realschule"" should be ""adjacent secondary school"" not ""nearby Realschule"" - the target translates the school type and uses ""adjacent"" not ""nearby

The word ""Aufrtitt"" (which appears to be a typo for ""Auftritt"") means ""performance"" not ""event"" - the model chose a more generic term. The phrase ""zum Aufrtitt"" indicates the gallery is about/of the performance, but the model's ""of the event"" loses this specificity. The model also omitted the word ""image"" and used ""picture"" instead, though this is a minor issue

"Initial translation: On Friday, the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for a new roof with the shrouding of the 301-year-old Mary Chapel in Rhöndorf.

Analysis: The German ""Dachmarke"" should be ""umbrella brand"" not ""roof"" - this is a marketing term for an overarching brand, not a building roof. The phrase ""Marienkapelle"" should be ""Lady Chapel"" not ""Mary Chapel"" - this is the proper English term. The phrase ""(Rundschau von Donnerstag)"" meaning ""(Thursday's Rundschau)"" was completely omitted from the translation. The context is about branding/marketing, not building construction, so the roof interpretation is semantically wrong

"Initial translation: The minis were clearly made easier and happier by the late afternoon and were able to pass through the door of mercy at Freiburg Cathedral.

Analysis: The German ""Sichtlich erleichtert und glücklich"" should be ""visibly relieved and happy"" not ""were clearly made easier and happier"" - this is a lexical error where ""erleichtert"" means ""relieved"" not ""made easier"". The phrase ""trafen die Minis am späteren Nachmittag am Freiburger Münster ein"" should be ""gathered together in Freiburg Cathedral late in the afternoon"" not ""by the late afternoon"" - this is a grammatical error where the model confused the timing. The German ""Pforte der Barmherzigkeit"" should be ""gates of mercy"" not ""door of mercy"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose singular instead of plural

Corrected translation: The children gathered together in Freiburg Cathedral late in the afternoon, visibly relieved and happy, and passed through the gates of mercy."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""Der Graben, den der Berliner Innensenator und die Polizei zwischen Hausbesetzern und ihren Nachbarn aufmachen"" should be ""The schisms that Berlin's Senator for the Interior and the police believe to have opened up"" not ""are not digging a trench"" - this is about perceived social divisions, not literal excavation. The phrase ""existiert so offenbar nicht"" should be ""do not exist"" rather than ""are not digging

Nach einigen Minuten erinnerten sich die Pferde an ihren Feierabend, sie jagten im schnellen Galopp nach Hause zu den Futtertrögen."	"Initial translation: After a few minutes, the horses remembered it was time for their tea and they galloped home.

Analysis: The German ""erinnerten sich die Pferde an ihren Feierabend"" should reference singular ""horse"" and ""wanted to go home"" not ""horses remembered it was time for their tea"" - the target uses singular form and the concept of wanting to go home, not remembering tea time. The phrase ""jagten im schnellen Galopp nach Hause zu den Futtertrögen"" should be ""raced back to its feeding trough at full tilt"" not ""galloped home"" - this omits the feeding trough destination and ""full tilt"" intensity.

Sie soll die Fahrer von zu schneller Fahrweise und Alkohol am Steuer abbringen."	"Initial translation: It is to discourage drivers from driving too fast and drinking and driving.

Analysis: The German ""von zu schneller Fahrweise"" should be ""from speeding"" not ""from driving too fast"" - ""speeding"" is more concise and natural. The phrase ""Alkohol am Steuer"" should be ""driving under the influence of alcohol"" not ""drinking and driving"" - the former is more formal and precise legal terminology. The structure ""It should discourage"" is more natural than ""It is to discourage

Analysis: The German ""mit Hilfe des ehemaligen Regierungspräsidenten Felipe González"" (with the support of ex-president Felipe González) is completely omitted from the prediction. The phrase ""stellvertretende Regierungschefin"" should be ""Vice-president"" not ""Deputy Prime Minister"" - different title. The phrase ""unterstützt...die Kritik an der Kanzlerin...als Verantwortliche"" should be ""has added to the critics to the councillor...her responsibility"" not ""is supporting the criticism of the Chancellor...for being responsible"" - the target has more complex structure about adding to critics and responsibility. The phrase ""die die derzeitige Krise herausbeschwört habe"" should be ""in untying the present crisis"" not ""for being responsible for the current crisis"" - different metaphor

Analysis: The German ""Hier wird mir rießigen Mengen gearbeitet"" should be ""Here they work with huge quantities"" not ""the amount of work that is going on here"" - the model misunderstood that this is about working with large quantities of product, not general work activity. The phrase ""staunen die Fernseh-Macher"" should be ""commented the television producers, astonished"" not just ""are amazed"" which loses the attribution structure. The product name ""Schwarzwälder Schinken"" should be translated as ""Black Forest ham"" not left in German. The sentence structure became fragmented instead of flowing naturally

Analysis: The German sentence structure was completely reorganized incorrectly. The phrase ""Gegen das...dezimierte Werder Bremen mussten die Stuttgarter zwischenzeitlich bangen"" should be ""The Stuttgarters had to take fear of the Werder Bremen, which...had been reduced to a team of ten"" - the model confused who was worrying about whom. The phrase ""wegen einer Gelb-roten Karte"" should be ""because of a yellow-red card"" not just ""red card"" - the yellow-red distinction is important. The word ""dezimierte"" should be ""reduced to a team of ten"" not just ""reduced...to ten men"" to match target phrasing. The model reversed the subject-object relationship

So etwa, als er einen Schuss von Ideye über die Latte lenkte (56.)."	"Initial translation: For example, when he put a shot over the bar from the edge of the box (56).

Analysis: The German ""lenkte"" means ""steered/directed"" not ""put"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a less precise verb. The phrase ""von Ideye"" (from Ideye) was completely omitted, losing the player's name. The model added ""from the edge of the box"" which doesn't exist in the German text - this is an addition error. The German ""über die Latte"" should be ""over the crossbar"" not just ""over the bar"" - missing the specific soccer terminology

Meine Mutter und meine Schwester sahen das auch und machten sich vor Lachen fast in die Hose, aber ich musste in die Notaufnahme."	"Initial translation: My mother and sister saw it too and they were laughing so much they nearly fell off their chairs, but I had to go to the emergency department.

Analysis: The German idiom ""machten sich...fast in die Hose"" should be ""started wetting themselves"" not ""nearly fell off their chairs"" - this is about uncontrolled laughter leading to potential incontinence, not falling. The phrase ""musste in die Notaufnahme"" should be ""had to be rushed to A & E"" not just ""had to go to the emergency department"" - the reference implies urgency with ""rushed"" and uses British terminology ""A & E

"Initial translation: The decision on which companies to bill was taken on that tour of the north of Lake Constance to which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.

Analysis: The place ""nördlich vom Plattensee"" should be ""in western Hungary"" not ""north of Lake Constance"" - ""Plattensee"" is the German name for Lake Balaton in Hungary, not Lake Constance. The phrase ""Die Entscheidung darüber, auf welche Firmen die Rechnungen ausgestellt werden sollen"" should be ""The selection of the companies in the name of which the bills were issued"" not ""decision on which companies to bill"" - this is about issuing bills in company names, not deciding who to bill. The phrase ""wurde auf jener Rundreise entschieden"" should be ""was completed on a trip"" not ""was taken on that tour"" - the reference suggests completion rather than decision-making. The structure should show János Zuschlag sent István Lados, not the other way around

""Hin und wieder überkommt einen solch ein Gefühl"", erklärte Jágr, nach dessen Aktion Giroux schon beim ersten Schuss der Flyers ein Tor erzielte."	"Initial translation: Jágr said, after Giroux's action, that he had 'a feeling' that he would score.

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""nach dessen Aktion Giroux schon beim ersten Schuss der Flyers ein Tor erzielte"" means ""after whose action Giroux scored"" - the model completely reversed who performed the action and when the scoring happened. The phrase ""Hin und wieder überkommt einen solch ein Gefühl"" should be ""You sometimes feel such things"" not ""had 'a feeling' that he would score"" - the model made it specific and predictive rather than general and reflective.

Einige, wie beispielsweise Frankreich, befinden 1 geliehenen € als äquivalent mit 1 gespendeten €."	"Initial translation: Some, such as France, are giving 1 for 1.

Analysis: The German ""befinden 1 geliehenen € als äquivalent mit 1 gespendeten €"" should be ""consider that a Euro lent is equal to a Euro donated"" not ""are giving 1 for 1"" - this is a major semantic error where the model simplified the concept of equivalence between lending and donating. The phrase ""geliehenen"" (lent) and ""gespendeten"" (donated) were completely omitted from the translation. The model lost the entire meaning about the equivalence of lending versus donating money

Corrected translation: Some, like France, consider that a Euro lent is equal to a Euro donated."	error_correction

Das Schöne bei Friends war, dass diese Fokussierung auf den Kopf gestellt wurde."	"Initial translation: The good thing about Friends was that it was put under the spotlight.

Kinochef Daniel Langlois hatte nach der eigenfinanzierten Konstruktion des Kinos über zehn Jahre lang unter großen Schwierigkeiten das Autorenkino in den Räumlichkeiten seines Kinokomplexes präsentiert, was die Ausnahmestellung seitens der Staatskasse rechtfertigen könnte."	"Initial translation: Daniel Langlois, the owner of the cinema, had, after building the cinema himself, been presenting the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years, which might justify the special status of the cinema in the state budget.

Analysis: The model added ""for more than ten years"" when the German ""über zehn Jahre lang"" in this context refers to duration, and omitted ""unter großen Schwierigkeiten"" (under great difficulties). The phrase ""Ausnahmestellung seitens der Staatskasse"" should be ""waiver by the Treasury"" not ""special status of the cinema in the state budget"" - this misses the specific concept of Treasury exemption. The reference also indicates ""previous owner"" which suggests the text continues beyond what the model translated, potentially making this an incomplete translation

Analysis: The German ""Schnelldurchläufe"" should be ""speedruns"" not ""run through the 100 metres"" - this is about video game speedrunning, not athletics. The phrase ""ganze Spiele in Rekordzeit absolvieren"" (complete entire games in record time) was completely omitted and replaced with ""100 metres"" which is wrong.

Analysis: The German ""Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS)"" should be ""Schotten Association for Tourism and Town Marketing (GTS)"" not ""Scottish Tourist Board"" - wrong location (Schotten is a German town, not Scotland). The phrase ""ein schönes Festambiente erhalten"" should be ""had acquired a lovely festive ambience"" not ""had been given a lovely festival atmosphere"" - different verb and formality. The German ""Leckereien"" should be ""nice nibbles"" not just ""treats"" - more specific food terminology. The phrase ""gut gekühltem Federweißer"" should be ""well-chilled Federweißer wine"" not ""cold white wine"" - Federweißer is a specific type of new wine, not generic white wine. The word ""natürlich"" (of course) was translated correctly

"Initial translation: The premium is EUR 1000 for the master's degree and EUR 2500 if graduates set up their own business within ten years of graduating.

Analysis: The German ""Prämie"" means ""prize/bonus"" but was translated as ""premium"" which has different connotations (insurance/subscription fee vs reward). The phrase ""Meisterprüfung"" means ""master craftsman examination"" but was simplified to ""master's degree"" - this loses the specific vocational/trade context of the German system. Similarly ""Meisterausbildung"" (master craftsman training) became just ""graduating"" losing the specialized training context.

The phrase ""wird...nicht nur...verändern"" should be ""does not want to change...just because of"" not ""will not only change...for"" - the model misses the negative intention and changes the causality. The phrase ""auf der Reus-Position"" should be ""just because of Reus's position"" not ""for Reus"" - the model simplifies the positional reference.

Analysis: The German ""unterschiedliche Wasserstände"" should be ""differing water levels"" (plural) not ""the level"" (singular) - this refers to multiple historical water marks. The phrase ""durch wechselnde Pegel des Rheins ablesbar"" should be ""caused by the varying levels of the Rhine can be read"" not ""can be seen by the changing levels"" - the water levels can be read/measured, not just visually observed. The word ""Mikwe"" should be ""Mikwe"" not ""mikveh"" - maintaining the German spelling as in the reference. The key concept that these are historical records that can be ""read"" (interpreted) is lost in favor of simple visual observation

The phrase ""in den Schubladen der Regierung"" should be ""on the Charest government programme"" not ""in the Charest government's drawers"" - the German idiom means ""in the plans/programme,"" not literal drawers. The model took both the military term and the metaphor too literally, changing the meaning from administrative planning to military storage.

The phrase ""heißt es 'Pump this party'"" should be ""the 'Pump this party' event will be taking place"" not ""it is 'Pump this party'"" - missing the event structure and future tense. The German ""am morgigen Samstagabend geht es mit einer Ü 25-Party weiter"" should be ""while one day later, on Saturday evening, festivities will continue with an over-25s party"" not ""tomorrow it is a 25-plus party"" - missing the continuity aspect, time specification, and event structure.

Analysis: The term ""Polyurethananzüge"" was literally translated as ""polyurethane suits"" when the reference uses ""full-length swimsuits"" - this is more descriptive and accessible to readers. The phrase ""gab es nur drei Weltrekorde"" was translated as ""there were only three world records"" but should be ""only three world records beaten"" to clarify that records were broken, not just present. The German ""Rekordflut"" was translated as ""record flood"" which is literal but the reference uses ""wave of them"" for more natural English

Mit der Frequentierung des Radweges bisher könne man nämlich sehr zufrieden sein."	"Initial translation: So far, the use of the cycle path has been very satisfactory.

Analysis: The German ""Mit der Frequentierung des Radweges bisher könne man nämlich sehr zufrieden sein"" has a complex structure where satisfaction is with the frequency of use, but the model translated this as ""the use...has been satisfactory"" which changes who/what is satisfied. The reference preserves the original meaning ""one can be very satisfied with how well the bicycle path is frequented"" showing that people are satisfied with the frequency of usage, not that the usage itself is satisfactory. The model's version suggests the usage quality rather than the satisfaction level with usage frequency

The phrase ""die man nicht mehr neu projektieren"" should be ""cannot be redesigned"" not ""cannot be re-projected"" - architectural/engineering context requires ""redesigned"". The key phrase ""are half-finished"" is completely omitted from the translation, losing important information about the construction state.

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""es ebenso wenig ein wie ein Teufelswerk ein Wundermittel zur Erzeugung von Elektrizität gibt"" is complex, meaning there is neither a miraculous nor diabolical source for electricity production. The model's translation ""no magic bullet, no more than there is a devil's work"" is incomplete and awkward - it fails to complete the thought about electricity production. The reference clearly states ""no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity"" which completes the intended meaning.

The model omitted the critical information about Proctor preferring ""Kunstleder normalem Leder"" (artificial leather over normal leather). The quote structure was destroyed and turned into indirect speech. The model created a completely different meaning about diet success rather than personal conviction about lifestyle choices

Analysis: The German ""nach dem Angriff auf die Küste über die 'Front am Gebirge' zu sprechen"" should be ""after approaching the coastline becomes 'necessary' to discuss about 'the mountain front'"" - the model misunderstood the temporal and causal relationships. The phrase ""der über die grünen Äpfel"" should be ""that of green apples"" referring to Cerda's speech topic, not describing Cerda himself as ""the green apple

Analysis: The German ""vor seinem Aus"" should be understood in sports context as ""before being substituted"" not ""before his exit"" - ""Aus"" in football means being substituted off the field. The word ""eingewechselte"" should be ""substitute"" not ""replacement"" - this is the proper football terminology.

Analysis: The German ""würden sie ganz von allein bei Freunden und Bekannten für ihren Arbeitgeber werben"" should be ""they will find you new employees among their friends and acquaintances"" not ""they will be your best advertisement"" - the model missed that this is specifically about recruiting/finding new employees, not general advertising. The phrase ""Bekannten"" should be ""acquaintances"" not ""family"" which changes the social circle reference.

Analysis: The model completely reversed the meaning - the German says these are ""Eigentumswohnungen"" (freehold flats) that are ""nicht interessant"" (not interesting) to people here because the locals ""nicht so gut betucht sind"" (aren't so well-off). The model made it sound like the properties are FOR poor people, when it means poor people aren't interested in expensive freehold flats.

The phrase ""in dem Brief des WestLB-Vorstands an die Mitarbeiter des Hauses"" should be ""In a letter from the WestLB board of directors to the bank's employees"" not ""The WestLB letter to staff"" - the target provides more formal detail including ""board of directors"" and ""bank's employees

Analysis: The German ""offener Mercedes-Oldtimer"" means ""open vintage Mercedes"" but the model specified ""Mercedes-Benz 300 SL"" which is not mentioned in the German - this adds specific model information not present in the source. The phrase ""in dem die Rheintöchter...posieren"" means ""in which the Rhinemaidens pose"" but was translated as ""with the Rhine maidens"" losing the important detail that they are posing inside the car. The word ""Rockergirls"" means ""rocker girls"" but was translated as ""biker girls"" which has different connotations (motorcycle vs rock music culture).

The phrase ""lobenswerte Sachen"" should be ""pieces you can praise"" (clothing items) not ""things to praise"" generally. The phrase ""was man dazu tragen kann"" should be ""what to wear them with"" not ""which you can contribute to"" - this is about fashion coordination, not charitable contribution. The word ""empfiehlt"" context should be ""recommend what to wear them with"" not general recommendation.

Analysis: The German ""In Kirchen"" should be ""in Kirchen"" (a place name) not ""in churches"" (religious buildings) - this is a proper noun. The word ""Urkunde"" should be ""deed"" not ""document"" - this is a specific legal document type. The phrase ""beide Orte"" should be ""both towns"" not ""both places"" - more specific terminology.

The phrase ""eine menschenunwürdige Unterbringung bescheinigt hatte"" should be ""had attested to inhumane accommodation"" not ""found...inhumanly detained"" - the prisoner attested to conditions, the court didn't find him detained. The word ""bescheinigt"" means certified/attested by the prisoner, not found by the court. The grammatical structure misattributes who did what to whom

The phrase ""dienten den Interessen des Islams"" should be ""served Islam"" not ""served the interests of Islam"" - the reference is more direct. The complex phrase ""entledigten sich in der Person des Diktators eines politischen Verbündeten"" should be ""got rid of a dictator, their political ally"" not ""got rid of a political ally"" - the reference emphasizes the dictator identity first, then explains the relationship.

Hinsichtlich des geschäftlichen Kompetenzbereiches oder dem Zielort der damit verbundenen Fonds hätte er niemals Kenntnis gehabt, so Simon."	"Initial translation: Simon said that he would never have known about the business competence or the target of the funds.

Analysis: The German ""Kompetenzbereiches"" in this context means ""award of contracts"" not ""business competence"" - it's about contractual authority. The phrase ""hätte er keinerlei Kenntnis gehabt"" should be ""he had no knowledge"" (past tense) not ""would never have known"" (conditional). The word ""Simon"" appears to be added incorrectly as it's not in the German source. The model also omitted ""damit verbundenen"" (related/associated)

Analysis: The German ""Im Konflikt um die Reichensteuer"" should be ""In the conflict regarding the tax on the wealthy"" not ""over the wealth tax"" - the target uses more formal language. The phrase ""der Profi-Fussball"" should be ""the professional football association"" not just ""professional football"" - the organizational aspect is missing. The phrase ""nach einem gescheiterten Schlichtungstreffen"" (following a failed mediation meeting) is completely omitted from the prediction. The phrase ""in eine Sackgasse manövriert"" should be ""have manoeuvred into a cul-de-sac"" not ""become stuck in a deadlock"" - different imagery and the action of maneuvering is lost

The phrase ""im Gymnasium"" should be ""in the grammar school"" not just ""at school"" - Gymnasium is a specific type of secondary school that should be identified.

The word ""krimellen"" should be ""criminal"" not leading to ""Crips"" - this appears to be a misinterpretation where the model confused similar-looking text.

Analysis: The German ""Bezirksliga-Staffel"" should be ""regional league's relay team"" not ""district league"" - the target emphasizes the team/relay aspect. The phrase ""SCW-Jungen"" should be ""SCW boys"" not ""SCW youths"" - more specific terminology. The phrase ""dort startet noch"" should be ""which is where...is also starting"" not ""where...is still playing"" - starting vs playing, and ""also"" vs ""still

Analysis: The translation is incomplete - it cuts off after ""185th"" in the target, failing to complete what event this was (likely Oktoberfest). The phrase ""schaffte es vor Millionenpublikum"" should be ""In front of millions of spectators...opened"" not ""managed to get through to millions of people"" - this changes the meaning from performing before an audience to achieving communication.

Analysis: The grammatical structure creates a run-on sentence listing slogans as the subject, when it should maintain the direct speech format with proper punctuation. The German ""ermächtigten Partisanen"" should be ""pro-government supporters"" not ""armed partisans"" - ""ermächtigt"" means empowered/authorized by government, not armed. The phrase ""mit erhobener Faust"" (with raised fists) is completely omitted from the translation. The word ""Dissidentinnen"" should be ""dissidents"" and the model correctly identified this. The punctuation and formatting of the quoted chants is inconsistent and unclear

Analysis: The German ""Randbefestigung"" was translated as ""side fence"" when it should be ""boundary fixing/boundary reinforcement"" - this is a specialized construction/surveying term that the model interpreted too literally. The phrase ""als Betriebsweg benutzt wird"" should be ""used as a passenger path"" not ""used as a road"" - ""Betriebsweg"" in this context refers to a service/operational path for pedestrians, not a vehicular road.

The phrase ""Besonders interessant"" should be ""This is particularly interesting"" not ""Very interesting"" to include the demonstrative reference. The model used ""birth clinic"" instead of ""maternity clinic"" which is the more standard medical terminology

Analysis: The German ""Wasserralle"" was mistranslated as ""water vole"" when it should be ""water rail"" - these are completely different animals (bird vs. rodent). The organization ""SPCA"" was unnecessarily expanded to the full name instead of keeping the standard abbreviation ""Scottish SPCA"". The phrase ""aufgepäppelt"" was translated as ""taken in"" but should be ""nursed back to health"" to convey the medical care aspect. The model missed the important detail about being ""put on a helicopter"" rather than just ""flown by helicopter""

"Translate the following German to English:
An einem Tisch sitzt die deutsche Gesellschaft, am Katzentisch die Migranten der ersten Generation."	"Initial translation: At the table is German society, at the cat's table are the first-generation migrants.

Analysis: The German ""Katzentisch"" should be ""kid's table"" not ""cat's table"" - this is a lexical error where the model was too literal. The German ""Katzentisch"" is an idiom meaning the children's table or less important table, not literally a cat's table. The phrase ""An einem Tisch sitzt die deutsche Gesellschaft"" should be ""The German society sits at the big table"" not ""At the table is German society"" - the model missed the contrast between the main table and the secondary table. The structure also lacks the emphasis of the original contrast

Corrected translation: The German society sits at the big table, the migrants of the first generation at the kid’s table."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Und weil er in der Krisenkommunikation danach so ziemlich alles falsch machte, was man falsch machen kann."	"Initial translation: And because he has made such a complete mess of crisis communication.

Analysis: The German ""in der Krisenkommunikation danach"" should be ""in the crisis talks afterwards"" not ""crisis communication"" - this is about talks/discussions, not general communication. The phrase ""so ziemlich alles falsch machte, was man falsch machen kann"" should be ""he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong"" not ""made such a complete mess"" - the target preserves the specific phrasing about doing everything wrong. The model condensed the detailed expression into a general summary, losing the specific meaning. The word ""danach"" meaning ""afterwards"" was omitted from the model translation

Corrected translation: And because in the crisis talks afterwards, he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong."	error_correction

Kinder hocken an ihren Köpfen, registrieren das gefälschte Blut und die stillen Körper und flüstern einander zu."	"Initial translation: Children huddle around their heads, registering the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whispering to each other.

Analysis: The German ""hocken an"" means ""crouch by"" not ""huddle around"" - it's about positioning, not grouping. The phrase ""gefälschte Blut"" should be ""fake blood"" not ""falsified blood"" - it's about special effects, not deception. The verb ""registrieren"" was correctly translated as noting/taking in, but ""take in"" is more natural than ""registering"" in this context. The model captured the scene but could improve precision and naturalness

"Translate the following German to English:
""Wir können auf ihn leider nicht zurückgreifen"", sagte Thomas Tuchel am Mittwoch."	"Initial translation: Unfortunately, we cannot go back to him, said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.

Analysis: The German phrase ""auf ihn zurückgreifen"" means ""isn't in the running"" or ""can't count on him"" (in sports context about player availability) not ""go back to him"" which suggests returning to someone. The phrase is about current availability/eligibility, not about returning to a previous relationship. In sports contexts, this typically means a player is unavailable due to injury or other reasons

Corrected translation: ""Unfortunately he isn't in the running,"" said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Bei dieser Angelegenheit sollte der dem Sportsgeist verursachte Schaden untersucht werden."	"Initial translation: This matter should be investigated to see if it is caused by the sporting spirit.

Analysis: The German ""der dem Sportsgeist verursachte Schaden"" means ""damage caused TO the sporting spirit"" but the model translated it as damage ""caused BY the sporting spirit"" - this completely reverses the meaning. The grammatical structure was misunderstood, changing who/what is causing versus receiving the damage

Corrected translation: The matter examines the type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""die in das Kriegsgeschrei über die 'Frühheimkehr' ausgebrochen sind"" should be ""sent into the turmoil of this war for an 'early return home'"" not ""who have started the war cry"" - the soldiers are sent into turmoil, not starting cries. The phrase ""ein Wunder schaffen"" should be ""bring about any miracles"" not ""do a miracle"" for better English flow. The structure ""kann nur eine wirklich romantische Seele"" should be ""Only a truly romantic soul...could believe"" not ending with ""is only a romantic soul

Jedem der Schläfer sollten mindestens 90 cm Liegebreite zur Verfügung stehen, zusammen also 180 cm."	"Initial translation: Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of bed space, so a total of 180 cm.

Analysis: The phrase ""der Schläfer"" should be ""one"" referring to one person in a double bed context, not ""the sleepers"" which suggests multiple people. The German is talking about width per person in a double bed scenario. The phrase ""Liegebreite"" means ""lying width"" which is more naturally ""width for one"" in this bed context. The structure should emphasize this is about double bed sizing

Corrected translation: The minimum width for one should be 90cm in double bed, i.e. 180 cm altogether."	error_correction

Eine angenehmere Feierstunde hatten sich am vergangenen Samstag wohl alle gewünscht, doch Petrus wollte dabei nicht mitspielen."	"Initial translation: A more pleasant occasion would have been wished for by all last Saturday, but Peter was not playing.

The phrase ""wollte dabei nicht mitspielen"" should be ""chose not to cooperate"" not ""was not playing"" - in the context of weather, this means the weather didn't cooperate. The opening should be ""Everyone had hoped for more pleasant conditions for the ceremony"" not ""A more pleasant occasion would have been wished for by all"" - more natural English and specifies it's about conditions/ceremony.

Analysis: The German phrase ""ließen die Parteichefs kaum in ihre Karten blicken"" was completely misunderstood - it should be ""there was hardly any chance to gain insight into the party leaders' cards"" (meaning revealing their strategies), but the model translated it as ""the party leaders have hardly been able to get a look in"" which suggests they couldn't participate rather than they didn't reveal their intentions. The phrase ""in den Debatten im öffentlich-rechtlichen Fernsehen"" should specify ""during the debate organized by the public television"" rather than just ""debates on public television"" to show it was a specific organized event

The phrase ""von Unterweißenbrunn aus auf die...Wiesen getrieben haben"" should be ""led their animals out of Unterweissenbrunn along the...meadows"" not ""drive their animals from...to the meadows"" - this is about movement along/through, not destination. The phrase ""mühselig gerodeten und von Steinen befreiten"" should be ""arduous, cleared and stoneless"" not ""which had been cleared and cleared of stones"" - the model repeated ""cleared"" unnecessarily. The model omitted ""According to his research"" and simplified ""are said to have

Corrected translation: According to his research, up to around 80 years ago, the goat herders are said to have led their animals out of Unterweissenbrunn along the arduous, cleared and stoneless meadows."	error_correction

`Wozu sollte ich einen Hamburger auf der Straße essen, wenn ich zuhause Filet habe?', scherzte er oft selbst."	"Initial translation: He would often joke that he would not eat a hamburger on the street if he had filet at home.

Analysis: The German ""Wozu sollte ich einen Hamburger auf der Straße essen, wenn ich zuhause Filet habe?"" should be ""Why am I going out to have my hamburgers, when I can have a good steak at home?"" not the model's indirect reporting - this should be a direct quote maintaining the rhetorical question format. The phrase ""auf der Straße"" should be ""going out"" not ""on the street"" in this context. The word ""Filet"" should be ""good steak"" for more natural English. The phrase ""scherzte er oft selbst"" should be ""used to joke himself"" not ""would often joke that he"" - maintaining the direct speech format

Zu ihrer Überraschung ließ das Miauen auch die Männchen nicht kalt - allerdings verhielten sie sich im Unterschied zu den Weibchen immer gleich."	"Initial translation: The males were also surprised by the meowing, but they remained silent, just as the females did.

Analysis: The German ""Zu ihrer Überraschung"" refers to the researchers' surprise, not the males being surprised - the model misattributed the surprise. The phrase ""ließ das Miauen auch die Männchen nicht kalt"" should be ""the miaowing didn't leave the male cats unaffected"" not ""remained silent"" - this is about emotional response, not silence. The key phrase ""im Unterschied zu den Weibchen immer gleich"" should be ""compared to their female counterparts, they always acted the same way"" not ""just as the females did"" - the model reversed the comparison, suggesting similarity when it should show consistent male behavior contrasted with varied female behavior. The grammatical subject misattribution fundamentally changes the meaning

Analysis: The translation is incomplete - it cuts off with ""because I am not"" without completing the thought. The German ""weil ich nicht so bin"" should be ""because this is not who I am"" not ""because I am not"" - the model fails to complete the meaning about identity/character.

The phrase ""gemusterten Samt"" should be ""patterned velvet"" not ""embroidered silk"" - both the pattern type and fabric are wrong.

The phrase ""damit uns der Brandmelder im Urlaub auf den Malediven mitteilt"" should be ""when you're lying on the beach in the Maldives"" not ""the fire alarm in the Maldives"" - the speaker is on vacation in the Maldives, the alarm isn't located there.

Analysis: The translation is incomplete - it cuts off with ""at least"" without completing the thought. The German ""schlimmstenfalls"" should be ""at best"" not ""at least"" - this reverses the meaning from worst case to best case. The phrase ""oder bestenfalls"" appears incomplete in both German and English, but the model should handle this more gracefully.

Analysis: The phrase ""ans Fastfood-Holen geht"" should be ""picking up some fast food"" not ""we go for fast food"" - the German emphasizes the action of fetching/getting food. The model's version is less natural English and misses the idiomatic expression ""right with you"" that captures the enthusiastic participation. The temporal phrase ""spätnachts beziehungsweise frühmorgens"" is better rendered as ""late at night, or early in the morning as the case may be"" rather than just ""late at night or early in the morning

Analysis: The German ""fiebert mit unseren Ladys mit"" should be ""cheers our ladies on"" not ""is in love with our ladies"" - the model completely misunderstood ""mitfiebern"" (to cheer on/support enthusiastically) as romantic love. The phrase ""Bayern-Legionär"" should be ""Bayern legionnaire"" not ""Bavarian Legionnaire"" - this refers to Bayern Munich football club, not Bavaria the region.

The phrase ""für das unaufgeklärte Ohr"" should be ""to the unenlightened ear"" not omitted - this qualifier is important for the perspective being described. The phrase ""passender für eine Clownsschule"" should be ""fitter for clown college"" not ""more like a circus school"" - ""clown college"" is the specific English term, and ""fitter"" is more precise than ""more like

The phrase ""liege mit etwa 1,8 Millionen Euro rund eine Millionen Euro über dem Ansatz"" should be ""at around EUR 1.8 million, also stood at around EUR one million above projections"" - the model missed that the 1.8 million IS the surplus amount, and it's one million above projections.

Analysis: The German ""abzuspeisen"" should be translated as ""fobbed off"" not ""feed"" - ""abspeisen"" means to dismiss someone with something inadequate, not literally to feed. The phrase ""Leistungskatalog"" should be ""catalogue of services"" not just ""benefits"" to be more specific.

The phrase ""Vorbote einer Achse der rechten Präsidentschaftskampagne"" should be ""forms part of the presidential re-election campaign"" not ""forerunner of a right-wing axis"" - the reference simplifies this complex political terminology.

Analysis: The German ""mitmischen"" should be ""will not miss"" not ""mixing it with the best"" - this is about participation, not competitive mixing. The phrase ""erfreulich ist auch"" should be ""And Czech football will thus gain"" not ""and it is also good"" - this is about gaining revenue, not general positivity.

The phrase ""mit demselben Team"" should be ""with similar equipment"" not ""with the same team"" - the reference interprets this as equipment, not teammates. The model misunderstood the sporting context and emotional tone

Corrected translation: The Argentinean has ended up being consoled with the medal of runner-up, and remained one step behind the winners and peculiarly with similar equipment he has played consecutive finals."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Dann gilt es, in Mainz die Königsklassen-Leistung im Liga-Alltag zu wiederholen."	"Initial translation: Then it is a matter of repeating the performance of the elite in the league.

Analysis: The German ""Königsklassen-Leistung"" refers specifically to ""Champions League performance"" not ""performance of the elite"" - this is a German football term where ""Königsklasse"" (literally ""king's class"") is the standard term for Champions League. The phrase ""dann gilt es"" should be ""will have to be"" not ""then it is a matter of"" for more natural English that matches the target structure

Corrected translation: The Champions League performance will have to be repeated in the day-to-day job of the league."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Ein Großteil der Lautsprecherdurchsagen fällt damit weg - der Lärmpegel soll so deutlich gesenkt werden."	"Initial translation: Much of the public address system announcements will be eliminated, thus reducing the noise level.

Analysis: The German ""Lautsprecherdurchsagen"" should be ""loudspeaker announcements"" not ""public address system announcements"" - the target is more direct. The phrase ""fällt damit weg"" should be ""will cease"" not ""will be eliminated"" - cease is less forceful and more natural. The phrase ""soll so deutlich gesenkt werden"" should be ""thus considerably reducing"" not ""thus reducing"" - the ""considerably"" adds important emphasis about the degree of reduction

Corrected translation: The majority of loudspeaker announcements will cease - thus considerably reducing the noise level."	error_correction

"Initial translation: The champion then provoked Johnson into pushing his sunglasses up his nose on Friday, saying that he wanted to see his eyes.

Analysis: The model reversed who did what - the German shows the champion ""knocked Johnson's sunglasses of his nose"" not that the champion ""provoked Johnson into pushing

Corrected translation: During weighing, the champion then allowed himself to be provoked to knock Johnson's sunglasses of his nose ""to be able to see into his eyes."""	error_correction

Das ist der eigentliche Hintergrund der Sache, über die der Richter in der Anhörung zur Behandlung der Anfechtungsklage, für die noch kein Datum festgelegt wurde, zu entscheiden hat."	"Initial translation: That is the real background to the case that the judge will decide on at the hearing to hear the appeal.

Analysis: The German ""Anfechtungsklage"" is specifically a ""demand of opposition/challenge lawsuit"" but was simplified to just ""appeal"" - this loses legal precision. The phrase ""über die...zu entscheiden hat"" was translated as ""will decide on"" but the reference suggests this should be ""has to be decided"" emphasizing obligation rather than future action. The model's version is clearer English but the reference maintains more complex legal language structure. The phrase ""für die noch kein Datum festgelegt wurde"" (for which no date has been set yet) was simplified compared to the reference's ""for which the date is no indicated yet"" which preserves the temporal uncertainty

Analysis: The German ""romantischen Kennenlern-Geschichten"" should be ""romantic ""How we met""-stories"" not ""romantic stories of meeting"" - the reference uses the more idiomatic English phrase. The phrase ""Putenfleisch"" should be ""turkey meat"" not ""pork"" - this is a completely different meat type. The phrase ""sich bei Aldi mal über Putenfleisch unterhalten"" should be ""head over to Aldi and talk about turkey meat"" not ""have a chat with Aldi about pork"" - this suggests going to the store and discussing turkey meat (presumably where a romantic encounter occurred)

"Initial translation: But the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland in 2015, hopefully on a fine day on 30 August or another weekend.

Analysis: The German complex sentence structure was severely simplified - the original has multiple clauses that should be preserved. The phrase ""Wir sehen uns im Jahre 2015 wieder bei hoffentlich schönen Wetter"" should be quoted as ""We shall see each other in 2015, hopefully with nice weather"" - the model removed the direct quotation. The phrase ""versprachen die Radfahrer aber trotzdem wieder ins Münsterland zurückzukommen"" should be ""the riders promised, but whatever the weather, they will return to Münsterland"" - the model omitted the weather condition clause. The phrase ""und die Veranstalter planen einen Neuauflage"" meaning ""and the organizers will plan a repeat"" was completely omitted

In der kommenden Nacht bricht in den Tälern der Alpennordseite der Föhn durch, wie Meteoschweiz am Dienstag mitteilte."	"Initial translation: Tonight, the valleys of the Alpine north side will be hit by a föhn, as MeteoSwiss announced on Monday.

Analysis: The German ""Meteoschweiz"" was correctly identified as ""MeteoSwiss"" but the day was changed from ""Dienstag"" (Tuesday) to ""Monday"" - this is a factual error about when the announcement was made. The phrase ""In der kommenden Nacht"" means ""in the coming night"" but was translated as ""Tonight"" which is less specific about timing. The word ""bricht...durch"" means ""breaks through"" but was translated as ""will be hit by"" which changes from the weather phenomenon breaking through to valleys being struck. The reference preserves ""foehn will break through"" which better captures the meteorological action

Corrected translation: The foehn will break through in the valleys on the northen side of the Alps in the coming night, Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday."	error_correction

"Initial translation: Money must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been updated in previous legislatures, must be brought up to date.

Analysis: While this is a reasonable translation of the German text, it completely misses the meaning conveyed in the target English, which seems to be a poorly constructed or mistranslated reference text about ""detonating tourist projects"" and ""labelling resources

Analysis: The German ""Der Hamelner"" refers to ""the Hamelin player"" (a person from Hamelin) but was translated as ""the Hameln"" which treats it as a place rather than a person. The phrase ""die Setzliste anführt"" should be ""is the top seed"" not ""leading the list"" - in sports contexts, ""top seed"" is the proper terminology. The verb ""erinnerte"" means ""remembers"" not ""reminds us"" - the model changed who is doing the remembering. These errors transform a description of a specific player's memories into a geographical entity reminding others

"Translate the following German to English:
Die unzähligen Male, die wir die Polizei hier sagen, sind unglaublich."	"Initial translation: The number of times we have told the police here is incredible.

Analysis: The German ""die wir die Polizei hier sagen"" should be ""we've seen the police down here"" not ""we have told the police here"" - this is about observing police presence, not communicating with them. The verb ""sagen"" appears to be a mistranslation or typo in the German source, but should be interpreted as ""sehen"" (see) based on context. The word ""unzähligen"" should be ""amount of times"" not ""number of times"" to match the target phrasing. The word ""unglaublich"" should be ""unbelievable"" not ""incredible"" to match the target

Corrected translation: The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Besonders kompliziert macht es immer das drohende Damoklesschwert Sonderbau und die Stellplatzverordnung."	"Initial translation: The most complicated thing is always the threat of special construction and the parking regulations.

Analysis: The German ""Besonders kompliziert macht es immer das drohende Damoklesschwert Sonderbau"" should be ""The sword of Damocles threatening special building projects...always make it complicated"" not ""The most complicated thing is always the threat of special construction"" - wrong grammatical structure and missing the classical metaphor emphasis. The phrase ""Damoklesschwert"" should be translated as ""sword of Damocles"" to maintain the classical reference. The word ""Stellplatzverordnung"" should be ""parking space regulations"" not just ""parking regulations"" - more specific terminology. The model reversed the emphasis from multiple things making it complicated to one most complicated thing

Analysis: The German ""Kopf des Kraken"" should be ""puppet master"" not ""head of the Kraken"" - this is a metaphor about control and manipulation, not literal tentacled leadership. The model completely omitted ""die Rothschilds"" (the Rothschilds), which is the crucial identification of which family is being discussed.

"Initial translation: Inside, the guests are packed in, dancing to live music until late at night or being dictated to by DJ rhythms and shouting at each other over cocktails.

Analysis: The German ""die Geladenen"" should be ""the invited"" not ""guests"" for more precision. The phrase ""weit nach Mitternacht"" should be ""way past midnight"" not ""until late at night

Voráček erkämpfte hinter dem Tor der Hurricanes den Puck und legte ihn zwischen den Kreisen dem erfolgreichen Maxim Talbot vor."	"Initial translation: Vránek fought for the puck behind the Hurricanes' net and put it between the pipes for the successful Maxim Talbot.

Analysis: The name ""Voráček"" was changed to ""Vránek"" - this is a different person. The phrase ""zwischen den Kreisen"" means ""between the circles"" (hockey terminology) not ""between the pipes"" (which means in the goal). The structure should be ""won the puck and presented it to Maxim Talbot, who scored"" not ""put it...for the successful Maxim Talbot

Die Studenten hätten ""Anspruch, Spielräume zu erhalten, die Eigeninitiative ermöglichen und fördern""."	"Initial translation: The students would have 'claims to have room to manoeuvre and to be able to take initiative'.

Analysis: The German ""hätten Anspruch"" should be ""are entitled"" not ""would have claims"" - this is a grammatical error where the model changed the modal structure. The phrase ""Spielräume zu erhalten"" should be ""to be granted leeway"" not ""to have room to manoeuvre"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a more complex phrase. The German ""die Eigeninitiative ermöglichen und fördern"" should be ""allowing and promoting initiative"" not ""to be able to take initiative"" - the model missed that the leeway itself should enable initiative, not that students should be able to take it

Corrected translation: The students are ""entitled to be granted leeway allowing and promoting initiative""."	error_correction

Analysis: The German idiom ""keine Bäume ausgerissen hat"" should be ""no't exactly in the best form at the moment"" not literally ""cut down any trees"" - this is an idiom meaning they haven't achieved much/performed well. The phrase ""Drittliga-Reserve"" should be ""third-tier reserves"" not ""reserve from Fredenbeck in the third league"" - the word order and specificity are different. The word ""warnend"" should be ""has issued a warning"" not just ""warns"" to match the target's more formal tone.

Analysis: The German ""Die gestiegenen Kosten pro Einheit sind immer noch geringer als bei derzeit verwendeten Maschinen"" means the increased costs are still lower than current machines, but the model added ""the cost of"" making it ""less than the cost of current...aircraft"" which changes the comparison structure. The phrase ""Maschinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe"" means ""machines with ten seats per row"" but was translated as ""ten-seater aircraft"" - this loses the crucial detail about seats per row vs total seats. The reference uses ""10-abreast"" which correctly captures the row seating arrangement. The model's version suggests total aircraft capacity rather than seating configuration

Corrected translation: The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use."	error_correction

"Initial translation: Réal Laporte, the big employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made a lot of people's noses wrinkle, because the agreement on the project management contract has been approved.

Analysis: The German ""der große Arbeitgeber"" should be ""The head of the Eastmain project"" not ""the big employer"" - the reference provides specific contextual information about his role. The idiomatic phrase ""die Nase...rümpfen lassen"" should be ""raised eyebrows"" not ""made people's noses wrinkle"" - while literally similar, ""raised eyebrows"" is the proper English idiom for expressing skepticism. The phrase ""nach Übereinkunft bewilligt"" should be ""awarded by mutual agreement"" not ""approved because the agreement"" - this is about contract awarding methodology, not approval reasoning. The model lost the specific project context and used awkward literal translations of idioms

Analysis: The German ""stieß...mit...an"" means ""clicked glasses with"" (a toast) not ""hit back at"" - the model completely misunderstood this as an attack rather than a friendly toast. The phrase ""der Funktionär aus Guangzhou"" should be ""the official from Guangzhou"" not ""The Guangzhou official"" - different word order. The phrase ""allerdings mit Rotwein"" should be ""albeit with red wine"" not ""with a glass of red wine"" - the model added ""glass"" and missed the concessive ""albeit

The phrase ""Verkehrseinrichtungen wie Leitplanken"" should be ""transport facilities such as crash barriers"" not ""traffic signs"" - the model omitted the crash barriers example and generalized incorrectly.

The phrase ""die man ihr noch schuldet"" means ""that still has to be paid"" not ""still owed to her"" - it's about general payment obligation, not specifically to her. The word ""infolgedessen"" means ""therefore"" which was omitted, breaking the logical connection.

Und diejenigen, die sich gegen Ansprüche wehren, wissen, dass die Zeit für sie ist, aber ganz sicher nicht mit den Klägern."	"Initial translation: And those who resist claims know that the time is now, but certainly not with the whingers.

Analysis: The German ""die Zeit für sie ist"" means ""time is on their side"" but was translated as ""time is now"" - this completely changes from having an advantage to urgency. The word ""Kläger"" means ""claimants/plaintiffs"" (legal term) but was translated as ""whingers"" which is pejorative and informal, losing the legal context. The phrase structure ""aber ganz sicher nicht mit den Klägern"" means the claimants don't have time on their side, but the model's version suggests disagreement with complainers rather than a legal time advantage

Corrected translation: And those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side, which the claimants certainly do not."	error_correction

Das kennt jeder, der sich schon mal aufregen musste, weil das Auto-Navi statt einer Umgehungsstraße eine grüne Wiese anzeigte."	"Initial translation: Everyone knows that if you get excited about the car navigation system, it will show you a green field instead of a detour.

Analysis: The German ""sich aufregen musste"" means ""has ever got worked up"" (past experience) not ""if you get excited"" (conditional). The model completely misunderstood the causal relationship - it's not that getting excited causes the problem, but that the navigation problem causes people to get worked up. The sentence structure and logic are backwards

Corrected translation: Anyone who has ever got worked up because the car's sat-nav is showing a green field instead of a bypass knows that."	error_correction

"Initial translation: The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for lost time with the Constitutional Treaty: 'The only goal is to get back to a major event, to win something.

Analysis: The German ""Pinzgauer"" refers to someone from the Pinzgau region, not just ""Pinzgauer"" - this is a named entity error. The phrase ""das verfehlte Edelmetall"" should be ""the missed medal"" not ""lost time"" - this is a semantic error where the model misunderstood the sports context. The German ""Verfassung"" should be ""constitution/form"" (physical condition) not ""Constitutional Treaty"" - major semantic error confusing sports terminology with political documents.

Analysis: The German ""Bezaubernde Jeannie"" should be translated as ""I Dream of Jeannie"" but the model left out this title completely and added content not in the original. The phrase ""netter Typ"" means ""decent guy"" not ""kindly patriarch"" - the model added the patriarchal role which wasn't in the German. The model also changed ""Years before"" to ""Before"" and added ""1960s and 1970s"" when the German specifies ""1965 bis 1970

The phrase ""der Steuerzahler"" should be ""the taxpayer"" not ""the public"" - this is more specific. The phrase ""der Staatskonzern trägt"" should be ""the state company"" not ""State-owned companies"" (plural vs singular).

Analysis: The German ""Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt"" should be ""Munich district mental asylum"" not ""Munich Circle Asylum"" - ""Kreis"" in this context means district, not circle. The phrase ""war entstanden"" should be ""had come to life"" not ""was created"" - the reference translation uses more vivid language suggesting organic development rather than simple creation.

The phrase ""die Leidenschaft, die er weiterhin weckt"" should be ""the passions it goes on engendering"" not ""the passion it arouses"" - ""engendering"" is more formal and ""goes on"" emphasizes continuation. The structure ""desto geringer"" should be ""the lower"" not ""the less"" to match the target's specific phrasing.

Analysis: The model missed that ""nasenbetäubenden Geruch"" means ""nose-numbing smell"" - this is about the actual overwhelming smell, not what you would imagine it to be like. The phrase ""So ungefähr muss man sich...vorstellen"" in this context means ""Now you have"" (experiencing it) rather than imagining it.

Liliane Bettencourt ""ist voll rechtsfähig, steht nicht unter Schutz und hat keinen Vormund."	"Initial translation: Liliane Bettencourt is 'fully capable, not under protection and has no guardian.

Analysis: The German ""wie sich Homosexuelle...gefühlt haben mussten"" should be ""the way homosexuals must have felt"" not ""as if I was a homosexual"" - this is about empathizing with their feelings, not identifying as one. The phrase ""vor der liberaleren Gesetzgebung"" should be ""before the liberal legislation of the Sixties"" not ""in the more liberal legislation"" - this is about the time before liberal laws, not during them.

Analysis: The German ""hatten es sich...gemütlich gemacht"" means ""had made themselves comfortable/at home"" but was interpreted as ""were well attended"" which changes from people settling in comfortably to simple attendance numbers. The phrase ""Rund um die Versorgungsstände"" (around the supply stands) was changed to ""The supply stations...were"" shifting from describing people gathering around stands to describing the stands themselves. The reference preserves the sense of people making themselves comfortable ""made themselves at home"" around the stands. The model lost the cozy, settling-in quality of the original

Der Rest der Stunde war ziemlich ruhig, doch als der Gong tönte, wurde ich regelrecht bestürmt."	"Initial translation: The rest of the evening was fairly quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was literally mobbed.

Analysis: The German ""Stunde"" means ""class/lesson"" not ""evening"" - this is a major semantic error that changes the entire context from a classroom to an evening setting. The word ""Gong"" should be ""bell"" in this school context, not ""gong"" which sounds unnatural. The phrase ""wurde ich regelrecht bestürmt"" should be ""they were all practically crowding me"" not ""I was literally mobbed"" - the model made it more dramatic and less precise than the original meaning

The term ""preiswert"" was translated as ""cheap"" when ""inexpensive"" would be more appropriate and less negative.

The phrase ""amtierenden Ratspräsidenten"" should be ""prime minister-designate"" not ""President-in-Office"" - this is about Italian politics

Corrected translation: ""Monti spoke about an important programme involving a lot of sacrifices,"" said Francesco Nucara, a deputy of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting the prime minister-designate."	error_correction

Portugal dominierte über mehr als eine Stunde klar die Partie, aber die Mannschaft war nicht imstande, der Sache den so wichtigen Stempel aufzudrücken, der den Druck von ihr genommen hätte."	"Initial translation: Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the final touches to the job, which was so important.

Analysis: The German ""der Sache den so wichtigen Stempel aufzudrücken"" means ""to reach this precious target"" (metaphorically putting a decisive stamp on the situation) but was translated as ""put the final touches to the job"" which sounds like manual work rather than achieving a crucial goal in football. The phrase ""der den Druck von ihr genommen hätte"" should be ""which would have consoled it"" not omitted - this explains the psychological relief the goal would have provided. The translation loses the emotional and strategic football context present in the original

Corrected translation: Whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour, it was not able to reach this precious target, which would have consoled it."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Mehrere Medien beriefen sich am Abend übereinstimmend auf ein gemeinsames Schreiben des Gremiums der Sachsen."	"Initial translation: Several media outlets referred to a joint letter from the Saxon parliament in the evening.

Analysis: The German ""Gremium der Sachsen"" appears to refer to ""the club's board"" according to the reference, but the model interpreted this as ""Saxon parliament"" - this could be context-dependent but suggests the model missed that ""Sachsen"" might refer to a sports club rather than the German state of Saxony. The word ""Schreiben"" means ""written statement/letter"" and both translations handle this adequately. The context seems to be sports-related based on the reference, but the model interpreted it as political. This demonstrates how context affects named entity interpretation

Corrected translation: In the evening several media outlets consistently referred to a joint written statement from the club’s board."	error_correction

Der Liederkranz Salzstetten sorgte mit seinem gemischten Chor und seiner Frauengruppe - dem ""Impulschor"" - für die Frauenquote des Festes."	"Initial translation: The Liederkranz Salzstetten provided the women's contribution to the festival with its mixed choir and women's group - the 'Impulschor'.

Analysis: The German ""sorgte für die Frauenquote des Festes"" should be ""ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival"" not ""provided the women's contribution to the festival"" - this is a semantic error where the model simplified the concept of fulfilling a quota. The phrase ""Frauengruppe"" should be ""ladies' ensemble"" not ""women's group"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a less formal term. The model also omitted the explanation that ""Impulschor"" means ""Impulse Choir"" in English

Corrected translation: With its mixed choir and its ladies' ensemble - the ""Impulschor"" (Impulse Choir), the Salzstetten Choral Club ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival."	error_correction

Branchenexperten schätzen den Wert der inzwischen in ""Greentowers"" umbenannten Türme der Zeitung zufolge auf rund 500 Millionen Euro."	"Initial translation: Industry experts estimate the value of the newspaper's 'Green Towers' at around EUR 500 million.

Analysis: The German ""der Zeitung zufolge"" means ""According to the newspaper"" but the model changed this to ""the newspaper's"" which makes it seem like the newspaper owns the towers rather than reporting the story. The phrase ""inzwischen in 'Greentowers' umbenannten Türme"" should be ""towers, renamed the 'Greentowers'"" not ""newspaper's 'Green Towers'"" - the model missed that these were renamed towers and incorrectly attributed ownership. The model also lost the attribution structure that shows this is newspaper reporting

Corrected translation: According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, renamed the ""Greentowers,"" at around 500 million Euros."	error_correction

Überraschenderweise zeigte sich, dass die neuen Räte in Bezug auf die diese neuen Begriffe etwas im Dunkeln tappen."	"Initial translation: Surprisingly, the new councils were not very clear about these new terms.

Analysis: The phrase ""die neuen Räte"" should be ""the new council members"" not ""the new councils"" - this is about individual members, not multiple councils. The German ""in Bezug auf die diese neuen Begriffe"" should be ""do not understand the well-known concepts"" not ""were not very clear about these new terms"" - the target suggests these are established concepts, not new ones, and ""understand"" is stronger than ""clear about

""Groß und Klein können an beiden Tagen verschiedene alte Handwerke erlernen"", heißt es in der Pressemitteilung."	"Initial translation: The press release says that 'big and small can learn different old trades on both days'.

Analysis: The German ""Groß und Klein"" should be ""adults and children alike"" not ""big and small"" - the target uses more formal terminology. The phrase ""alte Handwerke"" should be ""traditional handicrafts"" not ""old trades"" - the target emphasizes the traditional/cultural aspect. The word ""verschiedene"" should be ""various"" not ""different"" - more formal. The phrase ""heißt es in der Pressemitteilung"" should be ""said the press release"" not ""The press release says that"" - different attribution structure

"Translate the following German to English:
Insbesondere in den höheren Lagen ist daher erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit geboten."	"Initial translation: In particular, therefore, attention is needed in the higher areas.

Analysis: The German ""erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit geboten"" should be ""extra care should be taken while driving"" not just ""attention is needed"" - this omits the crucial ""while driving"" context that specifies the type of care needed. The phrase ""höheren Lagen"" should be ""higher levels"" not ""higher areas"" - levels is more specific to altitude/elevation context. The word ""geboten"" implies ""should be taken"" (an obligation) not just ""is needed"" (a requirement).

Analysis: The German phrase ""habe damit die Seiten gewechselt"" (has switched sides) was completely omitted - this is crucial information about changing allegiances. The phrase ""ohne Auflagen oder Übergangszeit"" should be ""without any restrictions or a transitional period being imposed"" not just ""without any conditions or transition period"" - the reference emphasizes the formal imposition aspect

Analysis: The German ""Bereits seit 15 Jahren"" should be ""It was 15 years ago that the Kaul family first invited"" not ""For 15 years now"" - this changes from a specific starting point to ongoing duration. The word ""Vesper"" should be ""snack"" not ""Vespers service"" - this is a German term for an afternoon snack, not a religious service. The sentence structure should emphasize the first invitation rather than ongoing repetition. The phrase ""danach zu einem Vesper"" refers to food, not prayer

The abbreviation ""ÚOHS"" should be translated to its English equivalent ""OPC"" (Office for the Protection of Competition) rather than left in Czech.

Analysis: The German ""auf die Opencard aufspielen"" should be ""add the electronic coupons to the Opencard"" not ""played on self-service machines"" - the model lost the specific Opencard system and the concept of loading/adding to a card. The phrase ""in einigen U-Bahn-Vestibüls"" should be ""in several vestibules of the metro"" not ""in some underground stations"" - vestibules are specific entrance areas, not stations generally. The verb ""aufspielen"" means to load/upload to a card system, not to play generally. The model missed the technical context of electronic payment systems

Analysis: The German opening ""Collage aus Prosatexten"" should be preserved as a headline ""In a collage of prose texts"" not omitted. The phrase ""stellt...zusammen"" should be ""creates a collage"" not ""has compiled a collage"" - different action and tense. The target provides English translation of the title ""(Summer lightning on the tip of your tongue)"" which is omitted from the prediction. The phrase ""zu sehen ist"" should be ""can now be seen"" not ""is now on"" - more formal construction. The phrase ""am Petersplatz"" should be ""on Petersplatz"" not ""in Petersplatz"" - preposition difference

Mit den harten und platzierten Aufschlägen taten sich die Gönninger äußerst schwer."	"Initial translation: The beneficiaries found it very difficult to cope with the hard and fast rules.

Analysis: The German ""Gönninger"" should be ""Gönningen"" (a place/team name) not ""beneficiaries"" - this is a proper noun referring to a sports team or location. The phrase ""harten und platzierten Aufschlägen"" should be ""hard and well-positioned offensive moves"" not ""hard and fast rules"" - this is about sports serves/attacks, not regulations.

"Initial translation: Proctor is doubtful about the vitamin B12 content of the meat that people buy from the fridge.

Analysis: This translation severely truncates the original content and omits critical information. The entire quote ""Da Tiere mit Futtermitteln genährt werden, statt auf der Weide zu grasen"" (Because animals are fed on fodder instead of grazing) is completely missing. The distinction between ""Kühltruhe"" (freezers) and ""fridge"" is lost. The quoted nature of the statement and Proctor's role as someone commenting rather than just being doubtful is not preserved.

The phrase ""Das wiederholte sich"" should be ""It happened again"" not just ""This happened"" - losing the repetition aspect that's central to the meaning. The model maintained ""much-quoted"" for ""viel zitierten"" but lost the temporal specificity and political context.

Analysis: The German ""fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete"" should be ""photoelectric homing rocket"" not just ""photoelectric rocket"" - missing the crucial ""homing"" capability. The phrase ""im darauf folgenden Jahr"" should be ""in the following year"" not ""in 1938"" - the model unnecessarily specified the year.

The word ""Meilen"" should be ""mileage award"" not just ""mileage"" - this is about reward points, not distance measurement. The phrase ""der Flugstrecke"" should be ""of the miles of the trip"" not omitted entirely.

The phrase ""ein großes Grab zu schaufeln"" was simplified to ""bury"" when it should be ""digging the graves of a large number"" - losing the metaphor and the quantifier ""large number"".

Analysis: The German ""Dreikönig-singer"" should be ""Dreikönig singers"" not ""Three Kings"" - this preserves the specific German cultural term. The phrase ""Jugenderinnerungen"" should be ""childhood memories"" not just ""memories"" - the youth aspect is missing. The quote ""Ach wie schön"" should be ""Oh how beautiful"" not ""Ah, how nice"" - the target uses more emphatic language.

Analysis: The German ""Zwischen all den futuristischen Konzeptfahrzeugen und neuen Oberklasse- und Luxusautos"" (In among all the futuristic concept vehicles and the new high-end and luxury models) is completely omitted from the prediction. This context is crucial as it contrasts the compact models with the luxury vehicles.

Analysis: The German ""preschte durch"" should be ""burst through"" not restructured as ""scored a try after"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the action sequence. The phrase ""weitere schwache Tacklings"" should be ""some more limp GB tackling"" not ""another weak tackle"" - this is a lexical error where the model simplified the plural and missed the emphasis of ""limp"".

The construction shows that the break was beneficial timing for him, not that he's suited for breaks in general.

Analysis: The German ""Mit Darina unterhalte ich mich ganz normal"" should be ""Darina and I communicate in a completely normal way"" not ""I am talking to Darina normally"" - the target emphasizes communication and uses different subject structure. The phrase ""nur das Bett teilen wir eben nicht"" should be ""only we do not share our bed anymore"" not ""but we are not sharing a bed at the moment"" - the ""anymore"" indicates a change, not current status.

The model misunderstood the causality: the jazz groups are struggling because of all-day school (students unavailable), not because they're doing the teaching. The phrase ""TV Jahn"" was truncated to just ""TV"" - missing part of the organization name. The word ""weiterführenden Schulen"" should be ""prep school"" not ""secondary schools"" - different educational terminology. The model reversed the subject-object relationship entirely

The German ""Fest"" should be ""party"" not ""celebration"" - there's a distinction between formal ceremony and informal party. The phrase ""rund um die Kirchtalhalle"" should be ""at the Kirchtalhalle"" not ""around the church hall"" - the model changed the specific venue name to a generic description and misunderstood the location reference.

The model only preserved ""It was not easy to tell him that"" but lost the attribution to Tedesco, the reference to Naldo, and the crucial information about not being in the starting lineup.

The phrase ""nicht mehr zu schaffen"" emphasizes the physical/mental capability to complete the journey, which the reference captures with ""be able to drive all the way home"" while the model's ""make it home"" is more generic.

The phrase ""der die Errettung der Menschheit symbolisiert"" should be ""which symbolizes the salvation of mankind"" not ""where salvation is symbolised"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the structure from relative pronoun to adverbial clause.

Es ist dort noch nicht einmal selbstverständlich, dass man einen Rollstuhlfahrer beispielsweise im Aufzug vorlässt."	"Initial translation: It is not even a given that a wheelchair user would be allowed to use the lift, for example.

Analysis: The German ""im Aufzug vorlässt"" means ""giving priority in lifts"" not ""would be allowed to use the lift"" - the model completely misunderstood the concept from courtesy/priority to basic access permission. The phrase ""nicht einmal selbstverständlich"" should emphasize that ""obvious things"" are not commonplace, but the model focused on prohibition rather than lack of courtesy. This changes the meaning from a discussion about social etiquette to one about accessibility restrictions

Corrected translation: Obvious things, such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts, are not commonplace there."	error_correction

Am Ende des Erhöhungszyklus fallen die Anleiherenditen sofort, sagte die Deutsche Bank."	"Initial translation: At the end of the cycle, the interest rates on bonds will immediately rise, according to Deutsche Bank.

Analysis: The German ""fallen die Anleiherenditen sofort"" should be ""bond yields fall immediately"" not ""will immediately rise"" - the model reversed the direction from falling to rising. The phrase ""Deutsche Bank"" should be ""Deutsche"" according to the target - this appears to be a shortened reference. The word ""Erhöhungszyklus"" should be ""hiking cycle"" not just ""cycle"" - this is about interest rate hiking cycles.

"Translate the following German to English:
Das Smartphone ist 20 Jahre nach seiner Erfindung eine Selbstverständlichkeit."	"Initial translation: The smartphone is 20 years after its invention, a given.

Analysis: The grammatical structure places ""20 years after its invention"" as an awkward parenthetical that disrupts the sentence flow. The German ""Das Smartphone"" should be ""smartphones"" (plural) as in the reference, not ""The smartphone"" (singular with definite article). The word ""Selbstverständlichkeit"" should be ""a fact of life"" not ""a given"" - while both convey obviousness, ""fact of life"" better captures the integration into daily existence.

Analysis: The German ""Schwarzwälder Füchse"" should be preserved as ""Schwarzwälder Füchse"" (with explanation ""Black Forest Chestnut Horses"") not translated as ""Black Forest foxes"" - these are horses, not foxes. The phrase ""Stilecht fuhr er"" should be ""True to style, he travelled"" not ""He drove"" - missing the style reference. The word ""vor"" at the end suggests arrival/appearance which is omitted.

Analysis: The German ""Nicht nur was das Leistungsvermögen betrifft"" should be ""And it was not only about top performance"" - the model missed the emphasis that it's NOT just about top performance. The phrase ""war die ganze Bandbreite an Sportlern vertreten"" means ""the entire range of athletic ability was represented"" but the model's version is awkward and unclear.

Analysis: The German ""zum zehnten Mal hintereinander"" should be ""for the tenth time in succession"" not ""once again"" - this is a semantic error where the model lost the specific numerical emphasis. The phrase ""die Liste der Neuanmeldungen in aller Welt anführe"" should be ""is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications"" not ""is the world leader in new cases"" - this is a semantic error where the model simplified ""trademark applications"" to just ""cases"" and omitted the specific context. The German ""teilt die Behörde mit"" should be ""informed the authority"" not ""the agency said"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a different verb and noun

The phrase ""profitierte nicht davon"" means ""did not benefit from it"" not ""was not involved"" - the model changed the meaning from lack of benefit to lack of participation.

The word ""Burgverein"" should be translated as ""castle club"" not left in German, as it's a compound noun that can be understood in English.

Analysis: The German phrase ""in die Konditorei zu gehen"" should be ""to go to a candy bar"" not ""to go to the bakery"" - this appears to be a coded reference or euphemism with a specific meaning. The model also lost the structure about being ""familiar with this character"" and ""guesses the right meaning"" versus simply ""knows what it means

Analysis: The German ""fragten mir Löcher in den Bauch"" should be ""bombarded me with one question after another"" not ""asking me to stick a hole in my stomach"" - this is a German idiom meaning to ask many questions persistently, not a literal action. The word ""durcheinander"" should be ""all at once"" not ""at cross-purposes"" - wrong interpretation of simultaneous talking. The word ""kicherten"" should be ""giggled"" not just ""laughing"" - more specific type of laughter.

The phrase ""das ist wohl allen Frauen eigen"" should be ""this is probably the nature all women"" not ""that is probably true of all women"" - missing the word ""nature"" and slightly different emphasis.

Mit einer FBI-Untersuchung im Turbotempo wollen die Republikaner im US-Senat die hauchdünne Mehrheit für den wegen Nötigungsvorwürfen umstrittenen Richterkandidaten Brett Kavanaugh sichern."	"Initial translation: With an FBI investigation in turbo-time, the Republicans in the US Senate are trying to secure the slim majority for the controversial judge Brett Kavanaugh.

Analysis: The German ""wegen Nötigungsvorwürfen umstrittenen"" (controversial due to coercion allegations) was simplified to just ""controversial"" - the specific reason for controversy was omitted. The phrase ""hauchdünne Mehrheit"" should be ""paper thin"" not just ""slim"" to capture the extreme precariousness. The model also omitted the context that this relates to Supreme Court nominations

Corrected translation: Republicans in the US Senate want the break-neck speed FBI investigation to help secure a majority for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has become paper thin amid allegations of sexual misconduct."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Nach dem offiziellen Teil wanderte die illustre Gesellschaft ins Springstadion, wo der Lavazza-Preis lief."	"Initial translation: After the official part of the evening, the illustrious company moved on to the Spring Stadium for the Lavazza Prize.

"Initial translation: This is a response to recent events: injuries from shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov's rampage.

Analysis: The target includes ""CLICK shots at weddings, where there were no casualties"" but the model says ""injuries from shootings"" - this changes the meaning completely, suggesting actual injuries when the target clarifies there were no casualties. The phrase about ""CLICK the death of seven people"" and ""massacre staged by"" is simplified to ""rampage

Corrected translation: This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents: CLICK shots at weddings, where there were no casualties, and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, resulting in CLICK the death of seven people."	error_correction

"Initial translation: And that was obvious when they first appeared in their bathing suits on the beach at the Hilton Hotel and when they appeared in their two outfits at the coronation.

Analysis: The German ""ihrer ersten Vorstellung im Badeanzug"" should be ""her first appearance in swimsuit"" not ""they first appeared in their bathing suits"" - this is about one person (singular feminine), not multiple people. The phrase ""bei ihren beiden Aufzügen bei der Krönungsfeier"" should be ""during her two shows at the evening coronation"" not ""when they appeared in their two outfits"" - ""Aufzügen"" means performances/shows, not outfits, and ""evening coronation"" was omitted.

Im Januar 2010 wurde sie unehrenhaft entlassen, so dass sie keinerlei Unterstützung erhält."	"Initial translation: She was sacked in January 2010 without any support.

Analysis: The German ""unehrenhaft entlassen"" should be translated as ""discharged under less-than-honorable terms"" not simply ""sacked"", as this refers to military/official discharge conditions rather than general employment termination. The phrase ""so dass sie keinerlei Unterstützung erhält"" was simplified to ""without any support"" but should be ""preventing her from receiving any benefits"" to show the causal relationship and specify ""benefits"" rather than general ""support"".

Die Niederlage in Kiel brachte die SPD ins Taumeln, die Düsseldorf-Pleite haute die Partei glatt um."	"Initial translation: The Kiel debacle brought the SPD to its knees and the Düsseldorf debacle finished it off.

Analysis: The German ""Taumeln"" should be ""tailspin"" not ""to its knees"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a different metaphor. The phrase ""die Düsseldorf-Pleite haute die Partei glatt um"" should be ""the Düsseldorf washout bowled the party clean over"" not ""the Düsseldorf debacle finished it off"" - the model lost the specific sporting metaphor of ""bowling over"" and the emphasis of ""glatt"" (clean). The model also repeated ""debacle"" instead of using varied vocabulary as in the original

"Translate the following German to English:
In die müsse investiert werden, sagen Trump und Clinton fast wortgleich."	"Initial translation: Trump and Clinton are almost saying the same thing.

Analysis: The crucial word ""müsse investiert werden"" (there has to be investment) was completely omitted. The German ""In die"" refers to infrastructure from the previous context, which should be ""There has to be investment in infrastructure

Es geht nicht nur darum, ein anständiger Mensch zu sein, sondern dass Sie im wahrsten Sinne des Sprichworts zu den Menschen gehören, die im Glashaus sitzen."	"Initial translation: It is not only a question of being a decent human being, but of being one of the people in the glass house in the true sense of the phrase.

Analysis: The phrase ""im wahrsten Sinne des Sprichwortes"" was translated as ""in the true sense of the phrase"" but should be ""proverbial"" - it's referring to the well-known proverb about glass houses and stones. The model translated ""Sprichwort"" as ""phrase"" instead of ""proverb"". The phrase should be ""you are the proverbial people in glass houses"" not ""being one of the people in the glass house"" - missing the idiomatic meaning. The structure is also awkward - ""a question of being"" should flow better as ""This isn't just to be""

"Translate the following German to English:
'Für mich wäre so eine Wohngemeinschaft aber nichts', meint sie mit einem Augenzwinkern."	"Initial translation: But, she says, 'for me, a shared house is not an option'.

Analysis: The German ""mit einem Augenzwinkern"" (with a wink) is completely omitted, which removes the playful tone of the statement. The phrase ""so eine Wohngemeinschaft"" should be ""this type of residential community"" not ""a shared house"" - the target uses more formal terminology. The word order ""However"" at the beginning is more natural than ""But"" for the target's formal tone. The verb ""commented"" is more appropriate than ""says"" for this context

"Initial translation: Hubert Wermters' story with the men's choir Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the herb festival, in which he was honoured with great ceremony.

Analysis: The German ""Herbsfestes"" appears to be ""Herbstfestes"" (Autumn Festival) but was translated as ""herb festival"" - this is likely a misreading or OCR error where ""Herbst"" (autumn) was seen as ""Herb"" (herb). The phrase ""Mit 60 Jahren als Sänger"" (Having been a singer for 60 years) was omitted from the model's translation, losing important context about his long career. The reference correctly identifies this as ""Autumn Festival"" and includes the 60-year detail. The possessive ""Wermters'"" should be ""Wermter's"" for proper English grammar

Alassane Pléa erweist sich im Sturm der Fohlen zusehends als Goalgetter."	"Initial translation: Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goal-getter in the storm of the foals.

The team name ""Fohlen"" should be presented as ""die Fohlen"" (with quotation marks) as it's a nickname, not translated as ""the foals

"Translate the following German to English:
Also muss man so tun, als ob der Zweifel fortan bestünde."	"Initial translation: So we must act as if the doubts will continue.

Analysis: The German ""als ob der Zweifel fortan bestünde"" should be ""that the doubt had always existed"" not ""will continue"" - this is about pretending the doubt existed in the past, not that it will continue in the future. The temporal reference is completely reversed from past existence to future continuation. The word ""fortan"" means ""from now on"" but in this context with ""bestünde"" (subjunctive past) it refers to acting as if doubt had existed historically. The grammatical mood and temporal logic are misunderstood

Corrected translation: It is now necessary to pretend that the doubt had always existed."	error_correction

"Initial translation: As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay USD 20 million, and Musk gives up the Chairman's position for three years, which is comparable to the German supervisory board.

Analysis: The German ""Vergleichs"" should be ""settlement"" not ""comparison"" - this is a legal settlement, not a comparison study. The phrase ""außerdem gibt Musk für drei Jahre das Amt des Chairman ab"" should be ""In addition, Musk is giving the office of chairman up for three years"" - the model added extra explanation about German supervisory boards that wasn't in the original. The phrase ""eine dem deutschen Aufsichtsratschef vergleichbare Position"" was correctly interpreted but should end the sentence there, not continue with additional explanation

The phrase ""anrief"" should be ""cold-calling"" not just ""called"" - this is a semantic error where the model missed the context that this was an unsolicited call.

Konsum hat überhaupt keine Kultur, das ist etwas ganz anderes."	"Initial translation: Consumption has no culture at all, that is something else.

Analysis: The model completely omitted the idiomatic expression ""from another opera"" which is crucial to understanding the meaning. The phrase ""das ist etwas ganz anderes"" should be interpreted as the idiomatic ""it's from another opera"" rather than the literal ""that is something else

The phrase ""dramatisch gestiegen"" in financial context should be interpreted as forced closure, not dramatic rise. The German ""die Aktien der europäischen Banken um mehr als 5%"" should be ""the rates of the European banks have raised more than 5%"" not ""stocks...have risen by more than 5%"" - the target uses ""rates"" not ""stocks"" and ""raised"" not ""risen

The phrase ""die Unbekannten"" should be ""the unknown assailants"" not ""the unknowns"" - more specific identification.

Ja, das würde ich tun, wenn er mir unsympathisch ist oder ich ihm eins auswischen will."	"Initial translation: Yes, I would do that if I do not like him or if I want to give him a slap.

Analysis: The German idiom ""ihm eins auswischen"" means ""to get back at someone"" or ""to get one over on someone"", but was literally translated as ""give him a slap"" which changes the meaning from psychological revenge to physical violence. The phrase ""wenn er mir unsympathisch ist"" should be ""if I didn't like somebody"" not ""if I do not like him"" - the reference uses the more natural indefinite pronoun.

The phrase ""wie das Finanzministerium jeweils aushilft"" should be ""the nature of the support provided by the Treasury"" not ""how the Finance Ministry helps"" - this is about the type/nature of support, not the manner of helping. The word ""Finanzministerium"" should be ""Treasury"" not ""Finance Ministry"" to match the target terminology.

The phrase ""zu bemerken"" should be ""noting"" not ""to say"" - this is a subtle but important difference in how the agreement is characterized.

The model added significant content about ""chanting the mantra of 'getting back to work'"" which doesn't appear in the German source shown

Corrected translation: Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also lastly from the CSU did not invoke the mantra ""return to work""."	error_correction

Da es auf diesen schnell Glätte gebe, ist, sobald die Temperatur unter zwei Grad fällt, der Streuer unterwegs."	"Initial translation: As soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the move.

Analysis: The German ""Da es auf diesen schnell Glätte gebe"" meaning ""As slippery ice quickly forms on them"" was completely omitted from the translation. This omission removes crucial context about why the gritter operates. The word ""Streuer"" should be ""gritter"" not ""spreader"" in this road maintenance context. The phrase ""ist...unterwegs"" should be ""sets off"" not ""is on the move"" - the German implies starting action, not ongoing movement

Analysis: The German ""sich ein Paar mit einer schwangeren Frau vorgeknöpft"" was completely mistranslated - ""sich jemanden vorknöpfen"" means ""to attack/confront someone"" and ""ein Paar"" refers to a couple (two people), not clothing.

Analysis: The German sentence structure suggests insurance companies as the subject, but the model adds ""He thinks that"" which changes the perspective. The phrase ""Krankenkassen"" should be ""Insurance companies"" not ""sick funds"" - more formal terminology. The phrase ""greifen...nicht nach Regressverfahren"" should be ""do not take regression procedures"" not ""do not resort to recovery procedures"" - the target uses specific legal terminology.

Analysis: The German ""Candiens"" should be ""Candiens"" not ""Czechs"" - this is a team name, not a nationality. The phrase ""erfahren Beck"" should be ""experienced back"" not ""experienced goalkeeper, Petr Cech"" - the model completely invented a name and position. The phrase ""büßten...ihre Führung ein"" should be ""lost their two-goal lead"" not just ""lost...their lead"" - the model omitted the two-goal specification.

The phrase ""auf ihren Sesseln kleben"" should be ""do not insist on their seats by all means"" not ""not going to stick around"" - this is about not clinging to positions of power, not general departure.

"Initial translation: For comparison, the annual consumption of pyrotechnic fuses by police pyrotechnicians to destroy ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brother army has been below 1 500 metres for several years.

Analysis: The German ""Zündschnüren"" should be ""firing lines"" not ""pyrotechnic fuses"" in this demolition context. The phrase ""Pyrotechnikern der Polizei"" should be ""police deminers"" not ""police pyrotechnicians"" - these are bomb disposal specialists.

The word ""Festzelt"" should be ""party tent"" not just ""big tent"" - missing the festive context. The explanation ""(Stoapfälzer rascals)"" was completely omitted from the translation, losing important context about what the group name means.

The phrase ""Selbstvertrauen"" should be ""self-confidence"" not just ""confidence"" for precision.

The model completely misunderstood the preposition structure - ""an der Uni"" (at university) and ""mit einer Beziehung"" (with a relationship) are separate prepositional phrases.

Analysis: The German ""Spottfrage"" means ""question asked with sarcasm"" not ""joke"" - it's about mockery, not humor. The model completely changed the context from sarcastic treatment of clients to collegiality among workers. The phrase should be about judgmental attitudes toward people seeking help, not about workers' relationships with each other. The model also added content like ""pharmacy staff and healthcare workers who do not want to work with young people, the correspondent said"" which appears to be additional material

The phrase ""Spartenverkäufe"" means ""sale of business units"" not ""specialised products"" - this refers to selling off divisions/subsidiaries.

The phrase ""mit der Kohlenstoff-14-Methode"" was correctly understood as carbon-14 analysis but the model changed it to ""carbon-14 content"" rather than ""carbon-14 dating"" which is more precise. This is a critical scientific error that completely changes the research methodology from examining shark eye lenses to fish livers

Corrected translation: They use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age."	error_correction

Nun gibt aber der Chef des Betriebes an, eine derart große Gruppe hätte nicht auf einmal in das Lokal hineingepasst."	"Initial translation: However, the manager of the business says that such a large group could not have all fitted into the restaurant at once.

Analysis: The German ""der Chef des Betriebes"" should be ""the director of the company"" not ""the manager of the business"" - ""Chef des Betriebes"" is more formal and should be ""director of the company,"" not the more casual ""manager of the business

Corrected translation: However, as the director of the company states, the establishment does not even have the capacity to provide seats for such a great number of people."	error_correction

Müller hatte von rechts mehr Glück, als seine Flanke aus dem rechten Halbfeld im linken oberen Toreck einschlug."	"Initial translation: Müller was luckier on the right than on his flank from the right-hand side into the left-hand corner.

Analysis: The grammatical structure creates an illogical comparison. The German describes a football play where ""his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal

Analysis: The German ""Rotkäppchenland"" should be ""Rotkäppchenland"" (Red Riding Hood Land) not ""Red Kettle country"" - this is a specific place name referring to the fairy tale character. The word ""Bahnradweg"" should be ""cycle track"" not ""cycle path"" - it's specifically a railway-converted cycle track. The phrase ""präsentiert sich schwer auffindbar"" should be ""accessing...is very difficult"" not ""is difficult to find"" - the emphasis is on access difficulty, not just finding it. The structure should emphasize the accessing challenge rather than just location identification

Corrected translation: Accessing the 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very difficult and heavily littered."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Sie muss es wissen und es sehen und darin aufgezogen werden."	"Initial translation: It must know and see it and be brought up with it.

Analysis: The German ""Sie muss es wissen"" should be ""She needs to know it"" not ""It must know"" - wrong gender/subject. The phrase ""darin aufgezogen werden"" should be ""be raised in it"" not ""be brought up with it"" - ""in it"" vs ""with it"" makes a difference in meaning about environment vs accompaniment

Corrected translation: She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it."	error_correction

Die polizeiliche Räumung des besetzten Casinos der Frankfurter Goethe-Universität schlägt weltweit Wellen."	"Initial translation: The police eviction of the occupied casino at Frankfurt University is making waves around the world.

Analysis: The German ""Räumung"" was correctly translated as ""eviction"" and ""besetzten"" as ""occupied"". The phrase ""schlägt weltweit Wellen"" was correctly rendered as ""making waves around the world"". The model simplified ""Frankfurter Goethe-Universität"" to ""Frankfurt University"" which loses the specific university name.

Mancher träumt in der Midlife-Crisis von einer neuen Karriere, andere wagen sich einfach mal aufs glatte Eis ihrer vagen Sehnsüchte."	"Initial translation: Some dream of a new career in midlife crisis, others just go for a ride on the smooth ice of their vague desires.

Analysis: The phrase ""in der Midlife-Crisis"" should be ""to escape a mid-life crisis"" not ""in midlife crisis"" - it's about escaping the crisis, not happening during it. The German ""wagen sich einfach mal aufs glatte Eis"" is an idiom meaning ""venture onto thin ice"" or ""test their vague aspirations"" not literally ""go for a ride on smooth ice"". The model missed the metaphorical meaning about taking risks. The model also added ""of their vague desires"" which doesn't appear in the German source

Corrected translation: Many dream of a new career to escape a mid-life crisis; others come to test their vague aspirations against the cold facts."	error_correction

Analysis: The German structure should be ""It performs the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law"" - the model added unnecessary words and changed the direct comparison. The phrase ""die mit der Funktion seiner Ehefrau oder seines Ehemannes verglichen werden kann"" should emphasize the functional comparison, not create a metaphorical likeness.

"Initial translation: The outsider team of captain Thomas Björn, with brilliant shots and great team spirit, dethroned the favourite USA, with a toothless Tiger Woods, in front of more than 150 000 spectators over three days at Le Golf National.

Analysis: The German ""Außenseiter-Team"" should be ""underdog team"" not ""outsider team"" - underdog is more common in sports contexts. The structure should be ""In front of 150,000 spectators at the Le Golf National, skipper Thomas Björn's underdog team displayed great shots"" rather than placing the crowd information at the end. The model's word order is less elegant and the sports terminology could be more precise

"Translate the following German to English:
Das Unternehmen hat am Standort gleich mehrere Eisen im Feuer."	"Initial translation: The company is in a number of difficult situations at the same time.

Analysis: The German ""mehrere Eisen im Feuer"" is an idiom meaning ""several irons in the fire"" (multiple projects/opportunities), not ""difficult situations"" - this is a major semantic error where the model misinterpreted the idiom completely. The phrase ""am Standort"" should be ""at the location"" not omitted - this is an omission error. The German ""gleich mehrere"" should be ""several"" or ""multiple"" not ""a number of"" - this is a lexical error.

Weit entfernt im weißen Haus scheint es, als wäre er ebenso einer Beteiligung abgeneigt."	"Initial translation: It seems a long way off in the White House that he is not interested in participating.

The phrase ""ebenso einer Beteiligung abgeneigt"" should be ""looking just as reluctant to be drawn in"" not ""not interested in participating"" - this suggests similar reluctance to previous mentioned parties. The phrase ""weißen Haus"" should be ""White House"" (capitalized as proper noun). The model misunderstood this as temporal/probability distance rather than physical location

The phrase ""während einer Benefiziveranstaltung"" should be ""at a black-tie fundraiser"" not ""during a benefit event"" - missing the formal dress code implication. The German ""mit schwebenden Verfahren am Gericht"" should be ""who have pending cases before the court"" not ""with pending cases in court"" - wrong preposition and missing relative pronoun structure.

The phrase ""riskieren den kompletten Verlust des Gehörs binnen von fünf Jahren"" should be ""risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period"" not ""risk losing their hearing completely within five years"" - the target emphasizes ""permanent"" and ""hearing ability"" with ""after"" rather than ""within

The phrase ""schmalen Kader"" should be ""slender squad"" not ""small squad"" - more precise terminology. The phrase ""mussten...antreten"" should be ""stepped into"" not ""had to play"" - different action emphasis.

Analysis: The German ""rausgeworfenes Geld"" was correctly translated as ""waste of money"" while the reference uses ""redundant"" which is less direct. The phrase ""die Hauptsache ist, dass ich etwas bringe"" means ""the main thing is that I contribute something"" but was translated with ""bring something"" which is less natural than the reference's ""sufficient to be good at something"". The phrase ""wie ich dabei aussehe"" means ""how I look while doing it"" but both translations simplify this. The model maintains first person ""I"" while the reference switches to third person ""they"" for more formal tone. The parenthetical explanation is clearer in the model's version

Analysis: The German ""Nach dem Einsatz von Streufahrzeugen"" should be ""as a result of chemical treatment"" not ""after snowploughing"" - Streufahrzeuge are salt/grit spreaders, not snowploughs. The word ""Schneematsch"" should be understood as the result of chemical treatment, not remaining snow. The phrase ""bleibt Schneematsch"" describes the slush that results from chemical treatment, not leftover snow. The model completely misunderstood the cause-and-effect relationship and the type of vehicles involved. The German describes the aftermath of chemical de-icing treatment

Analysis: The German ""Platz"" in this context means ""pitch/field"" (sports field) but was translated as ""place"" which is too generic - the reference correctly uses ""third pitch"" showing this is about sports facilities. The phrase ""Realschule am Salinensee"" should be ""secondary school on Salinensee Lake"" as the reference shows, but the model kept ""Realschule"" untranslated and used ""at Salinensee"" rather than explaining the lake connection. The model also used ""it was planned"" while the reference uses ""were considered"" which better captures the preliminary nature of the thoughts

Analysis: The phrase ""hat zu guter Letzt ihre eigenen Mütter und Väter gefressen"" is metaphorical meaning ""eats up its own supporters/creators"", but the model translated it too literally as ""devoured its own mothers and fathers"". The key missing element is understanding that this modernization policy had unintended consequences that hurt the party itself.

The phrase ""Wahr-Falsch-Referendums"" was simplified to just ""referendum"" when it should specify ""true-false Greek referendum

The reference captures this with ""If we are in real big trouble"" which conveys the intended meaning. The phrase ""bin ich immer gesprächsbereit"" was literally translated as ""I am always ready to talk"" while the reference uses ""then I might consider it"" which suggests more reluctance and conditionality.

Einige sind doppelt - das gleiche Gesetz wurde sowohl dem Kongress als auch dem Senat vorgelegt - andere weichen nur leicht voneinander ab."	"Initial translation: Some are double - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - and others are slightly different.

Analysis: The German ""Gesetz"" should be ""bill"" not ""law"" in legislative context. The phrase should be ""both the House and Senate"" not ""Congress and Senate

Veranstalter sind der Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, der Skiclub und die Traktorfreunde ""Zündkäpsele""."	"Initial translation: The organisers are the multi-purpose hall promotion association, the ski club and the tractor enthusiasts 'Zündkäpsele'.

Analysis: The German ""Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle"" should be ""community hall association"" not ""multi-purpose hall promotion association"" - it's more concise and natural. The word ""Traktorfreunde"" means ""tractor friends"" but in this context refers to a club, so should be ""tractor enthusiasts"" (which the model got right). However, the model should explain ""Zündkäpsele"" as ""(blasting caps)"" or similar since it's a regional nickname. The model also missed ""The event is organised by"" structure

Corrected translation: The event is organised by the community hall association, the ski club and the ""Zündkapsele"" (blasting caps) tractor enthusiasts."	error_correction

Denn blöder als bislang geht es nicht: Sommerferien, Hitze und Landtagswahlkampf - das beißt sich."	"Initial translation: Because it is not going to get any worse than this: summer holidays, heat and state election campaigns - it is a tough time.

Analysis: The German ""blöder als bislang geht es nicht"" was mistranslated as ""it is not going to get any worse than this"" when it should be ""The way things had been going was simply ridiculous"", completely changing the meaning from criticism of past ridiculousness to prediction about future difficulty. The phrase ""das beißt sich"" was translated as ""it is a tough time"" instead of ""they clash with one another"", losing the specific meaning of conflicting elements. The word ""Landtagswahlkampf"" should be ""state parliament elections"" not ""state election campaigns"" to be more precise

Corrected translation: The way things had been going was simply ridiculous: summer holidays, heat and state parliament elections - they clash with one another."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Daher habe man sich einen Teil der Aufwandsentschädigungen erst Jahre später, nämlich ab dem Jahr 2003, als ein Plus auf dem Konto gewesen sei, ausgezahlt."	"Initial translation: So, part of the back payments were paid years later, namely from 2003, when there was a surplus.

Analysis: The German ""Aufwandsentschädigungen"" should be ""expense allowance"" not ""back payments"" - these are different types of payments. The phrase ""ausgezahlt"" should be ""paid off"" not just ""paid"" - implying completion of a debt. The German ""als ein Plus auf dem Konto gewesen sei"" should be ""when the account went into credit"" not ""when there was a surplus"" - more precise financial terminology. The word ""Plus"" in banking context means credit balance, not general surplus. The model simplified the financial terminology and changed the payment type

Corrected translation: As a result, a part of the expense allowance was paid off years later, that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit."	error_correction

"Initial translation: Many of the actors he meets in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat themselves, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.

Analysis: The German ""Darsteller"" should be ""interpreters"" not ""actors"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a more general term. The phrase ""auf die er in `Sangre de mayo' stößt"" should be ""some of which fall within the cast of Sangre de mayo"" not ""he meets in 'Sangre de mayo'"" - this is a semantic error where the model simplified the meaning. The German ""müssen vor seiner Kamera wiederholen"" should be ""repeat in front of his video-camera"" not ""have to repeat themselves"" - this is a semantic error where the model made it reflexive when it should be about repeating performances. The model also changed ""Michael Rell"" to ""Miguel Rellán"" in the reference translation

Gar nicht erst zur Abstimmung war nach vielen Einsprüchen schon davor der Vorschlag gekommen, das Finale an einem neutralen Ort auszutragen."	"Initial translation: The final was to be held in a neutral venue even before the vote, after many objections.

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""Gar nicht erst zur Abstimmung war...gekommen"" means ""did not even make it to the vote"" but the model incorrectly parsed this as ""even before the vote"" - this completely reverses the meaning from something that never reached voting stage to something planned before voting. The word ""Vorschlag"" (suggestion/proposal) was omitted entirely. The complex German syntax with the negation ""gar nicht erst"" was not properly handled, leading to a fundamental misunderstanding of whether the vote happened or not

""Wir haben Geld vorgeschossen, unsere Lebensversicherungen als Sicherheit bei der Bank hingelegt"", sagte er bei der Einvernahme."	"Initial translation: He said that we had'shot money' and that we had 'put our life insurance in the bank'.

Analysis: The German ""Geld vorgeschossen"" should be ""advanced money"" not ""shot money"" - this is a major lexical error where the model completely mistranslated the verb. The phrase ""Lebensversicherungen als Sicherheit bei der Bank hingelegt"" should be ""deposited our life insurance policies with the bank as security"" not ""put our life insurance in the bank"" - this is a semantic error where the model simplified the concept of using insurance as collateral. The German ""bei der Einvernahme"" should be ""during the examination"" not omitted - this is an omission error. The model also has a punctuation error with ""had'shot"" instead of proper spacing

Analysis: The place name ""Weilen unter den Rinnen"" should remain as ""Weilen unter den Rinnen"" not changed to ""Weilen under the Rheineck"" - this is a specific place name that should not be altered or confused with a different location. The German ""Schwarzwurstbaron"" should be ""black sausage baron"" not ""black pudding baron"" - while related, these are different sausage types. The phrase ""Mit dabei sein wird"" should be ""will also be there"" not ""Among them will be"" for more natural English. The structure should emphasize he's ""better known as"" the nicknames

"Initial translation: While Clotilde Reiss is held in Iran, the Elysée is not holding back in its efforts to convince us that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is playing a 'key' and 'influential' role.

Analysis: The German ""schont...nicht"" means ""did not spare/control"" but was interpreted as ""is not holding back"" which changes the meaning from restraining efforts to intensifying them. The phrase ""mittels Verlautbarungen und von den Medien organisierter 'Fluchtversuche'"" (by means of communiques and media-organized ""leaks"") was completely omitted - this is crucial information about the methods being used. The verb tense shifted from past ""schont...nicht"" to present continuous. The model also added ""convince us"" which isn't present in the German

The phrase ""alles ist real"" should be ""everything is real"" not ""It is all very real"" - different emphasis and subject. The German ""auch später in der Erinnerung"" should be ""even later in his memory"" not ""and it is all very vivid in the memory"" - missing the ""even later"" temporal aspect and wrong possessive (his vs. the).

Analysis: The German ""Hoy"" is a person's name (Chris Hoy, the cyclist) but was translated as ""Today"" - a classic named entity error where the model confused a proper noun with a temporal adverb. The phrase ""sah von seiner Position als BBC-Experte aus zu"" should be ""watched on from his position as a BBC pundit"" not ""looked like a BBC expert"" - the model misunderstood the prepositional structure and changed the meaning from observing in his role to appearing like an expert. The phrase ""fiel...auf"" means ""caught the eye of"" but was translated as ""spotted"" - inverting who is doing the noticing

The phrase should show that this is about Guatemala responding to the US request, not just the US making a request. The reference shows this as ""the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of north country that claimed for Portillo to judge him there"" - indicating the bilateral nature and Guatemala's role.

"Translate the following German to English:
Wo sie entstanden sind und wie es dort aussieht, in seiner Heimat."	"Initial translation: Where they were born and how they look in their homeland.

Analysis: The German ""Wo sie entstanden sind"" should be ""Where they originated"" not ""Where they were born"" - wrong verb choice for non-living entities. The phrase ""wie es dort aussieht"" should be ""what it looks like"" not ""how they look"" - wrong subject and meaning. The word ""es"" refers to the place/situation, not ""they"" referring to the entities. The phrase ""in seiner Heimat"" should be ""in his home country"" not ""their homeland"" - wrong possessive pronoun and less formal term.

The phrase ""schon öfters"" should be ""from time to time"" not ""on several occasions"" to match the target's tone.

The phrase ""schwäbisch angehaucht"" means ""given a touch of Swabian colour"" not ""Swabian at heart"" - ""angehaucht"" suggests a light influence, not a core identity. The model also simplified the contrast structure and lost the geographical specificity.

This explanation is crucial for understanding the wordplay. The phrase ""gestaltet...den großen Unterhaltungsabend"" should be ""provide a great evening of entertainment"" not just ""provide the entertainment"" - missing the ""great"" qualifier.

"Initial translation: Broken glass, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, demolished bins and now defunct signposts - this is how the entrance to the Haaße hill in Treysa has looked for some time.

Analysis: The German ""Scherben"" should be ""shards"" not ""broken glass"" - less specific term. The phrase ""mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder"" should be ""now dismantled signs"" not ""now defunct signposts"" - ""demontiert"" means physically taken apart, not just non-functional. The German ""Sitzgruppe zum Radweg"" (seating area to the bike path) was completely omitted from the translation - missing important detail about the facilities. The word ""präsentiert sich"" should be ""presents itself"" not ""has looked"" - different verb choice and formality. The repetition ""rubbish and rubbish"" shows the model struggled with ""Müll und Unrat"" which should be ""garbage and rubbish

The phrase ""rechnet...mit einem Bedarf"" should be ""estimates that accommodation...will be required"" not ""is expecting to have"" - this is about estimating need, not having capacity. The word ""Quartieren"" should be ""accommodation"" not ""rooms"" - this is broader than just hotel rooms. The semantic difference is between estimating need versus having capacity

Analysis: The grammatical structure with ""in the eight- to 12-year-olds"" is awkward and unnatural in English

Unter anderem gibt es bei der Lufthansa künftig keinen Vorstand mehr für das Passagiergeschäft."	"Initial translation: For example, there will be no passenger business unit at Lufthansa in future.

Analysis: The German ""Unter anderem"" should be ""Among other things"" not ""For example"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a different transitional phrase. The phrase ""keinen Vorstand mehr"" should be ""no executive board"" not ""no business unit"" - this is a semantic error where the model confused organizational levels. The German ""Vorstand"" specifically refers to executive board/management board, not just a business unit. The model also changed ""Lufthansa in the future"" to ""at Lufthansa in future"" which is less precise

Corrected translation: Among other things, Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business."	error_correction

Typisches Beispiel: Beim engen Überholen oder Vorbeifahren an entgegenkommenden Autos ""streift"" man an manchen Stellen den anderen Wagen nur leicht, in anderen, nahezu identischen Situation kommt man aber ins Schleudern und dreht wilde Pirouetten."	"Initial translation: A typical example: when overtaking or passing close to oncoming vehicles, one may 'touch' the other car lightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations, one may spin out of control.

Analysis: The German sentence structure has two distinct parts, but the model omits the key second sentence. The phrase ""an manchen Stellen den anderen Wagen nur leicht"" should be ""you sometimes lightly touch the other car"" not ""touch the other car lightly in some places"" - ""Stellen"" refers to occasions, not physical locations. The second part ""in anderen, nahezu identischen Situation kommt man aber ins Schleudern und dreht wilde Pirouetten"" should be ""Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes"" - the model captured this but lost the structural separation and the ""wild pirouettes"" reference. The model also misses that this describes vehicle dynamics, not just contact

Corrected translation: Typically, when overtaking or passing cars tightly in common traffic, you sometimes lightly touch the other car. Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Dennoch erklärten sie gegenüber den die Informationen betreffend Zuständigen nicht wirklich besorgt wegen der allgemeinen Glaubwürdigkeit."	"Initial translation: However, they did not really express concern to the people responsible for the information.

Analysis: The German ""nicht wirklich besorgt wegen der allgemeinen Glaubwürdigkeit"" should be ""not openly declared to be less worried with respect to credibility"" not ""did not really express concern"" - the target has a more complex meaning about declaring worry levels regarding credibility. The phrase ""die Informationen betreffend Zuständigen"" should be ""information clerks"" not ""people responsible for the information"" - more specific terminology. The nuanced meaning about credibility concerns is lost in the prediction

Corrected translation: Yet, to the information clerks, they have not openly declared to be less worried with respect to credibility."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Ich habe Servietten daraus bei Festessen in den Kaminen schmoren sehen."	"Initial translation: I have seen serviettes used to wipe up the ashes from fires.

Analysis: The German ""schmoren sehen"" should be ""glowing"" not ""used to wipe up"" - the model completely misunderstood the meaning. The phrase ""bei Festessen in den Kaminen"" means ""on the hearths at banquets"" not ""ashes from fires

"Initial translation: The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after he had left the arena with great pleasure and aesthetics.

Analysis: The model omitted the key phrase ""was brought on shoulders"" which indicates the manner of triumph - being carried by the crowd. The phrase ""cut three ears"" should be ""cut three ears"" (correct) as this refers to bullfighting trophies. However, the ending ""left the arena with great pleasure and aesthetics"" seems to add content not present in the German source when it should be about being carried on shoulders

Corrected translation: This was the triumph of Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was brought on shoulders after he had bull fought with taste and aesthetics."	error_correction

The structure should be ""We cannot continue to tell ourselves that there is time left"" not ""We cannot continue as we are"" - the model lost the self-deception aspect. The attribution should be ""assesses the singer from Benin, Angelique Kidjo"" not ""said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin"" to match the target's formal tone and word order

""Fördern kann man dort auf einer Fläche von insgesamt 75.000 Quadratkilometern."	"Initial translation: It can be promoted over an area of 75 000 square kilometres.

Analysis: The German ""Fördern"" in this mining/extraction context should be ""mine"" not ""promoted"" - this is about mineral extraction, not advancement or promotion. The phrase ""kann man dort"" should be ""It is possible to"" not just ""It can be"" to match the target's more formal construction.

Analysis: The German ""Mehr als 20 Jahre wurden sie erwartet"" should be ""There were more than 20 years of wait"" not ""More than 20 years have been expected of them"" - this is about a waiting period, not expectations placed on the band. The phrase ""dass sich für sie ein Traum verwirklicht"" should be ""that for the member is also a dream turned into reality"" not ""their dream will come true"" - the reference suggests individual member perspective and uses ""turned into reality"" rather than ""come true

"Translate the following German to English:
Sollte der Druck zu weiteren Fusionen steigen, gehen ihr nach und nach die Partner dafür aus."	"Initial translation: If there is pressure for further mergers, they will gradually lose their partners.

Analysis: The German ""Sollte der Druck zu weiteren Fusionen steigen"" should be ""Should the pressure for more mergers increase"" not ""If there is pressure"" - wrong conditional structure (subjunctive vs. indicative). The phrase ""gehen ihr nach und nach die Partner dafür aus"" should be ""it will by degrees be running out of potential partners"" not ""they will gradually lose their partners"" - wrong subject (ihr = to it, not they) and wrong verb meaning (ausgehen = run out, not lose). The word ""Partner"" should be ""potential partners"" to capture the sense of available merger targets. The model changed the grammatical mood and misunderstood the subject reference

Corrected translation: Should the pressure for more mergers increase, it will by degrees be running out of potential partners."	error_correction

Analysis: The German structure ""Von der Beendigung des Vollversammlungsmodells...ist Puigcercós' Team...wie besessen"" should be ""Ending with the assembly model...has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós"" - the model restructured it completely. The phrase ""das schon auf den letzten beiden Kongressen dafür kämpfte"" should be ""that already battled in this sense in both last congresses"" not ""which has been fighting"" which changes the timeframe. The model's structure is clearer but doesn't match the target's specific phrasing and emphasis

Außerdem führen sie Praktika während des Jahres im M2 durch und unterrichten dann ein Jahr vor den Schülern als Lehrer im Praktikum."	"Initial translation: They also do internships during the year in M2 and then teach a year to the students as teachers in the internship.

Analysis: The German ""Praktika während des Jahres im M2 durchführen"" should be ""cover in-class placements throughout the M2 year"" not ""do internships during the year in M2"" - this is about structured educational placements, not general internships. The phrase ""vor den Schülern als Lehrer im Praktikum"" should be ""in front of pupils for a year as student teachers"" not ""teach a year to the students as teachers in the internship"" - the model confused the relationship and structure

Corrected translation: Furthermore, they will cover in-class placements throughout the M2 year, and will then be in front of pupils for a year as student teachers."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""Es scheint mir auch nicht schlecht zu sein"" should be ""It did not seem a bad idea"" not ""It seems to me that it is not bad"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the tense and certainty level. The phrase ""wenn sie dich schon vorgehen lassen"" should be ""if you're forced to go"" not ""if they let you go ahead"" - this is a semantic error where the model missed the reluctance/compulsion aspect. The German ""Staus auf der Straße"" was correctly translated as traffic jams, but the overall context suggests this might be about race queues, not traffic

Corrected translation: It did not seem a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it should be to withdraw all things (including the chip to avoid queues during the race)."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Wir erwarten ebenfalls, dass das Programm zum Kauf von Obligationen fortgesetzt und ein stärkendes Signal ausgeben wird."	"Initial translation: We also expect the programme of purchases of bonds to continue and to send out a strong signal.

Analysis: The German ""Obligationen"" was translated as ""bonds"" but the reference uses ""vouchers"" which suggests a different financial instrument. The phrase ""ein stärkendes Signal ausgeben"" should be ""give signs of intensifying it"" not ""send out a strong signal"" - the reference emphasizes strengthening/intensifying rather than just strong signaling. The model's translation is more literal but misses the specific context and nuance

Corrected translation: We also hope that they continue with their program of vouchers purchase and give signs of intensifying it."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Die Anrufung des Richters zur Anberaumung der Versammlung ist der einzige juristische Weg, der die Einberufung der Gesellschafterversammlung gewährleistet."	"Initial translation: The call for the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.

Analysis: The German ""Anrufung des Richters zur Anberaumung"" should be ""appeal to the judge for determining"" not ""call for the judge to convene"" - this is about judicial determination, not direct convening. The phrase ""bis zur Lösung des Konflikts"" (until the conflict is solved) is completely omitted from the translation. The word ""Gesellschafterversammlung"" should be ""the meeting's convention"" not ""shareholders' meeting"" - this maintains the reference's more general terminology. The translation loses the temporal context about conflict resolution that's important in legal proceedings

Corrected translation: The appeal to the judge for determining the assembly is, until the conflict is solved, the single legal mechanism that guarantees the meeting's convention."	error_correction

Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden nach Last-Minute-Pleite ""am Boden zerstört"""	"Initial translation: Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden after last-minute collapse 'destroyed'

Analysis: The German ""Verbandsliga"" should be translated as ""Association League"" rather than left untranslated, as this is a specific German sports league classification. The word ""Pleite"" in sports context means ""loss/defeat"" not ""collapse"" which suggests structural failure rather than a game result. The phrase ""am Boden zerstört"" should be ""devastated"" rather than just ""destroyed"" to better convey the emotional state after a sports defeat. The model kept German sports terminology and misinterpreted the sports-specific language

"Initial translation: Before the hospital in Horovice where he has worked for the past year, he was for ten years in the paediatric department of the Motol hospital where the ambulances brought drunk students from near and far.

Analysis: The German ""Er ist in meiner Seele"" should be ""It is in my soul"" not ""He is in my mind"" - this refers to an abstract concept or feeling (likely grief/memory) that exists in the soul, not a specific person in the mind. The phrase ""schlimmer, wenn der Jahrestag näher rückt"" should be ""worse when the anniversary gets close"" not ""worse as the anniversary approaches"" - the reference uses more direct, emotional language.

Analysis: The German ""abgeschundenen"" means ""battered"" not ""sunken"" - this suggests wear/damage, not collapse. The model changed ""Fersen"" (heels) to ""knees"" which is completely incorrect anatomy. The technical term ""Visco-Schaum"" should be ""lazy foam"" as in the target, not ""visco-elastic foam

The phrase ""milliardenschwere"" should be ""multi-billion Euro"" not ""EUR 100 billion"" - this is a semantic error where the model gave a specific figure instead of the general ""multi-billion"" concept.

The phrase ""aus der Taufe heben"" should be ""came to existence"" not ""baptised"" - this is a lexical error where the model was too literal with the German idiom.

Analysis: The German ""beschäftigte die Polizeiinspektion...gleich doppelt"" means ""kept the police station busy twice"" but was translated as ""was caught twice by the police"" - this changes the meaning from causing work/problems for police to being arrested. The phrase ""in der Nacht von Samstag auf Sonntag"" (during the night from Saturday to Sunday) was simplified to ""on Saturday night"" losing the Sunday connection. The concept of ""beschäftigen"" (to occupy/keep busy) was completely lost and replaced with ""caught"" which implies criminal apprehension rather than just requiring police attention

Corrected translation: During the night from Saturday to Sunday a 48 year old man gave the police station in Kulmbach twice something to do."	error_correction

Am Sonntag, an dem auch die Abtswinder Kirchweih gefeiert wurde, hatte der Verein aus Anlass des Jubiläums am Nachmittag die Getränkepreise wie vor 60 Jahren festgesetzt."	"Initial translation: On the Sunday when Abtswind also celebrated its church festival, the association set the prices for drinks in the afternoon to mark the anniversary.

Analysis: The German ""Abtswinder Kirchweih"" should be ""Abtswinder Kirchweih (parish fair)"" not ""Abtswind church festival"" - the reference provides the English explanation in parentheses and uses the German term. The phrase ""hatte der Verein aus Anlass des Jubiläums am Nachmittag die Getränkepreise wie vor 60 Jahren festgesetzt"" should be ""the association set the drink prices in the afternoon as they were 60 years to celebrate the anniversary"" not ""set the prices for drinks in the afternoon to mark the anniversary"" - the model omitted the crucial detail that prices were set to match what they were 60 years ago.

""Ich dachte, die Wehen würden einsetzen. Ich rannte schreiend aus dem Gerichtssaal."""	"Initial translation: I thought the pains would start, and I ran out of the courtroom screaming.

Analysis: The German ""Wehen"" should be ""labor"" not ""pains"" - in medical context, ""Wehen"" specifically refers to labor contractions during childbirth. The phrase ""Wehen würden einsetzen"" should be ""I was going to go into labor"" not ""the pains would start"" - this is about the onset of childbirth, not general pain. The quotation marks are missing from the model's translation. The coordinating conjunction should be ""I ran screaming from the courtroom"" not ""and I ran out of the courtroom screaming"" - the reference uses ""from"" not ""out of"" and omits ""and

Analysis: The German ""Carodisten"" should be ""supporters of Carod"" not ""carodists"" - this refers to political supporters, not a general group. The phrase ""einen Strafzettel verpassen"" should be ""carry certain vote of punishment"" not ""give a ticket"" - this is about political punishment, not traffic violations. The word ""Repressalien"" should be ""retaliation"" not ""reprisals"" to match the target. The model completely misunderstood the political context and made it sound like traffic enforcement

"Initial translation: It felt like a bus was coming for Tom Mitchell and Co. when Osea Kolinisau went over in the corner.

Analysis: The German ""als würde man in fahrende Busse laufen"" means ""as if running into moving buses"" (plural) but was translated as ""like a bus was coming"" (singular) which changes the imagery from running into multiple buses to one bus approaching. The phrase ""Die World Series-Gewinner gingen 5-0 nach oben"" (The World Series winners went 5-0 up) was completely omitted from the model's translation - this is crucial game information. The word ""rüberhechtete"" means ""dived over"" but was simplified to ""went over"" losing the specific diving action. The model lost the key sports context and score information

Analysis: The German ""derjenige, der über ein solches Territorium verfügt"" should be ""whoever finds himself to be the sovereign"" not simply ""the person who has such a territory"" - missing the sovereignty aspect. The phrase ""im Vorteil"" was translated as ""in a better position"" but should be ""surely holds more cards in his deck"" which is a more vivid metaphorical expression.

The phrase ""Käsewecken"" should be ""cheese rolls"" not just ""cheese"" - the bread component is missing. The phrase ""Danach gibt es"" should be ""Afterwards there will be"" not ""Then there is"" - different temporal structure and future tense.

Analysis: The German ""verteilt Swiss Schoggi"" means ""Swiss distributes chocolate"" where Swiss is the airline, not ""Swiss Schoggi is distributed"" - the model makes the product the subject instead of the company. The phrase ""Schoggi von Chocolat Frey"" should be ""chocolate from Chocolate Frey"" not ""Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey"" - the target treats ""Schoggi"" as the generic word for chocolate. The phrase ""auf der Kurzstrecke"" should be ""On short-haul routes"" not ""on short-haul flights"" - routes vs flights.

The phrase ""nahegebracht hat"" should be ""bringing them nearer to"" not ""bringing them into"" - this is about bringing closer/making familiar, not literal entry.

The phrase ""bekomme einen echten, im Zweifelsfall vermarktbaren Gegenwert"" was simplified to ""you get a real, marketable asset"" but should be ""are rather getting a genuine, when in doubt saleable, equivalent in value"" - losing the conditional ""when in doubt"" and the specific term ""equivalent in value

Corrected translation: I do not consume any foreign cholesterol and have increased my vitamin intake."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Wenn Justin Bieber einen Kaffee trinkt, staunt man an der Fensterscheibe."	"Initial translation: If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, people stop and stare at the window.

Analysis: The German ""staunt man an der Fensterscheibe"" should be ""people goggle through the window"" not ""stop and stare at the window"" - the reference captures the idea of looking through glass to observe someone, while the model suggests staring at the window itself. The verb ""staunen"" means to be amazed/goggle rather than simply stare. The preposition ""an"" in this context means people are positioned at the window looking through it, not looking at it as an object. The model misunderstood the spatial relationship and the nature of the observation

Corrected translation: When Justin Bieber drinks coffee people goggle through the window."	error_correction

Auf den Wert der Tochter muss die Hypo Real Estate nun Abschreibungen vornehmen, die einen ""wesentlichen materiellen Effekt"" auf die Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung der Gruppe haben werden, heiß es recht unbestimmt."	"Initial translation: Hypo Real Estate must now write off the value of its daughter, which will have a'substantial effect' on the group's profit and loss account.

Analysis: The German ""Auf den Wert der Tochter"" should be ""according to the subsidiary's worth"" not ""the value of its daughter"" - business terminology vs. family relationship. The phrase ""muss die Hypo Real Estate nun Abschreibungen vornehmen"" should be ""Now Hypo Real Estate has to induce write-offs"" not ""Hypo Real Estate must now write off"" - different structure and verb choice. The German ""wesentlichen materiellen Effekt"" should be ""significant, material effect"" (with quotation marks) not ""substantial effect"" - missing the material aspect and quotation marks. The phrase ""heiß es recht unbestimmt"" (it said rather vaguely) was completely omitted. The model confused business subsidiary with family daughter terminology

Corrected translation: Now Hypo Real Estate has to induce write-offs according to the subsidiary's worth that will have a `significant, material effect' on the group's profit-and-loss statement, it said rather vaguely."	error_correction

Analysis: The German source ""Diese Botschaft hat das Floß am Samstag auf der Isar"" is incomplete - it appears to cut off mid-sentence, but the model completed it as if it were a full sentence. This is an incomplete translation where the model should have indicated the sentence was unfinished. The phrase ""hat das Floß"" should be ""the raft had"" not ""was delivered"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the subject-verb relationship.

Analysis: The German ""griff er schon lange nicht mehr an"" means ""he did not attack"" not ""has not touched him"" - ""angreifen"" means to attack/criticize, not physical touch. The phrase ""der wiederum keinen trockenen Faden an Pelta lässt"" means ""who has constantly criticised Pelta"" not ""Pelta has not touched him either"" - the model completely misunderstood the relationship and direction of criticism.

Analysis: The German ""Verschönerungswunsch"" should be ""renovation request"" not ""beautification project"" - more formal terminology. The phrase ""für Ihre Einrichtung"" should be ""for their institution"" not ""for your establishment"" - the target uses third person rather than direct address. The phrase ""können Sie sich...bewerben"" should be ""they can register this"" not ""you can apply"" - different grammatical person and action

The parallel structure ""sie mag nicht, was Sie nicht mögen"" (she dislikes what you dislike) was similarly changed to ""whatever you do not like"" maintaining the loss of the third-person subject.

The phrase ""einen ungerechtfertigten Nutzen aus dem Gegenteam ziehen"" should be ""takes advantage unjustly of the opposite team"" not ""gaining an unfair advantage over the other team"" - the target emphasizes ""from"" (aus) the opposite team. The target has a more complex structure about ""the team of the law breaker players"" vs just ""the counterfeiters

Analysis: The German ""Fast drei Milliarden sank das Budget"" should be ""The budget is almost three billion shot"" not ""Almost EUR 3 billion was cut from the budget"" - ""sank"" here means the budget took a hit/was shot, not that money was cut from it. The phrase ""für verschiedene Entschädigungen"" should be ""to cover various damages owed"" not ""for various compensation"" - this is about covering debts/damages. The phrase ""für Aufwendungen für die Gerichtsstreite"" should be ""to meet the cost of judicial disputes"" not ""for court costs"" - more specific language. The phrase ""sogar für das Bausparen"" should be ""and even to cover building society savings"" not ""even for savings"" - ""building society"" is the specific type of savings

"Initial translation: They should also preferably have ventilation holes in the floor (if there are none already) and mattresses with a spring core and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket springs and fine upholstery.

Analysis: The German ""Platte"" should be ""board"" not ""floor"" in this furniture context. The phrase ""mit Federskelett"" should be ""with spring framework"" not ""with a spring core"" - framework is more specific to the structural element. The German ""Taschenfederkern"" should be ""springs in the bags (from German Taschenfederkern)"" not ""pocket springs"" - the target preserves the German term with explanation.

The phrase ""sich...beschäftigen"" should be ""mess with"" not ""are involved in"" - more aggressive action. The phrase ""heimlichen Start- und Landebahnen"" should be ""clandestine airstrips"" not ""secret runways"" - more specific terminology.

Analysis: The phrase ""kümmerte sich um die Kanalisation"" means ""plumbed"" (worked as plumbers) not ""was to do with sewers"" - it's about their profession, not association.

The phrase ""auf gut Deutsch"" should be ""In plain language"" not ""That is to say"" - this is a specific German idiom.

The phrase ""obligatorischen Gesangseinlagen"" should be ""obligatory vocal number"" not ""obligatory singing"" - ""vocal number"" is more appropriate for entertainment performances. The opening ""Nicht wenige"" should be ""Quite a few"" not ""Not a few"" - the reference uses more natural English phrasing.

The phrase ""schmerzhaft hinausschob"" means ""laboriously extended"" not just ""postponed"" - it emphasizes the painful/difficult nature of the delay. The model also simplified ""zur Rettung Griechenlands"" to ""on Greece's rescue"" when ""of rescuing Greece"" is more precise. The causal relationship and the country's perspective were lost

Corrected translation: The second headache for the Central European country was when Merkel laboriously extended the decision of rescuing Greece."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Dazu sei die Gemeinde auf die Mitwirkung der Bürger angewiesen."	"Initial translation: The community must rely on the participation of citizens.

Analysis: The German sentence is incomplete as provided, but the target adds context: ""In order to develop such a concept, the town is reliant on the cooperation of its citizens

Corrected translation: In order to develop such a concept, the town is reliant on the cooperation of its citizens."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Gleichzeitig dürfen die Grundrechte wie das Recht auf Gewerkschaftstätigkeit nicht unberücksichtigt bleiben."	"Initial translation: At the same time, fundamental rights, such as the right of trade union activity, cannot be set aside.

Analysis: the translation accurately captures the meaning

Corrected translation: At the same time, fundamental rights, such as the right of trade union activity, cannot be set aside."	clean_translation
"Translate the following German to English:
Professoren der University Toronto stehen darauf, der University of Cambridge, der Uni Wien oder aus Berkeley in Kalifornien."	"Initial translation: Professors at the University of Toronto want to go to the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.

Analysis: The German ""stehen darauf"" means ""are on it"" (on a list/roster) not ""want to go to"" - the model completely misunderstood the meaning. This changes from professors being listed/affiliated to professors wanting to travel. The sentence structure should show these are all equal affiliations, not a desire to move from Toronto to the others

Corrected translation: Professors of Toronto University are on it, as are those from the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna and Berkeley in California."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Wir sind in Dänemark dem Ziel einer höheren Beschäftigung und gesunden Staatsfinanzen ein gutes Stück nähergekommen, während wir uns gleichzeitig eine sozial verantwortungsvolle Gesellschaft bewahren und Rücksicht auf die Umwelt nehmen."

Es wäre für das Haus ausgesprochen nützlich, wenn der Ratsvorsitz uns darüber informieren könnte, welche Gründe und Rechtfertigungen die vier bereits erwähnten Regierungen für ihre Ablehnung des Statuts vorbringen."

"Translate the following German to English:
Latinos schlurfen immer noch zwischen Apartments umher, wie menschliche Packtiere beladen mit um die 50 gebügelten T-Shirts, die an einer auf ihren Schultern liegenden Joch-ähnlichen Stange hängen."	"Initial translation: Latinos are still slinking between apartments, carrying human pack animals, with 50 or so T-shirts hanging from a yoke around their necks.

Analysis: The German ""wie menschliche Packtiere beladen mit"" should be ""carrying, like human mules,"" not ""carrying human pack animals"" - the model misunderstood the simile structure. The phrase ""gebügelten T-Shirts"" should be ""pressed shirts"" not just ""T-shirts"" - the ironing detail is important. The phrase ""auf ihren Schultern liegenden Joch-ähnlichen Stange"" should be ""from a yoke across their shoulders"" not ""around their necks"" - the location is wrong and dangerous. The word ""schlurfen"" should be ""shuffle"" not ""slinking"" - this is about tired movement, not sneaky behavior

Corrected translation: Latino men still shuffle between apartment buildings carrying, like human mules, 50-odd pressed shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
""Fleischgerichte sind dagegen exklusiv, und zwar im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes, denn sie schließen andere aus"", stellt Proctor fest."	"Initial translation: Proctor says that'meat dishes are exclusive, and that is the real meaning of the word', and he is right.

Analysis: The phrase ""sie schließen andere aus"" (they rule others out) was completely omitted. The German ""stellt fest"" should be ""assessed"" not just ""says

Corrected translation: ""Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, as they rule others out,"" assessed Proctor."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Wenn Rychtář Iveta Bartošová in Zukunft doch verlassen sollte, dann wird er daheim sicher nicht offenen Armen empfangen."	"Initial translation: If Rychtář were to leave Iveta Bartošová in the future, he would certainly not be welcomed with open arms at home.

Analysis: The German sentence structure suggests that the relationship is between Rychtář and Bartošová, but the reference clarifies this as ""Even if one day Rychtář and Bartošová would split up, his wife will not welcome him"" - indicating that Bartošová is not his wife, but someone else he's involved with. The model misunderstood the relationship dynamics and translated as if Rychtář is leaving Bartošová to return to his wife, when the correct interpretation is about a potential split between Rychtář and Bartošová, after which his actual wife won't welcome him back. The grammatical conditional structure also differs from the reference's more definitive ""Even if one day"" construction

Corrected translation: Even if one day Rychtář and Bartošová would split up, his wife will not welcome him with open arms."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
""Um den Einfluss gewisser Interessengruppen zu beschränken, die dazu tendieren, Disziplinar- und Berufungskommissionen zu beeinflussen, was bis in widerwärtige Situationen ausartet"", führte Paclík an, der keinen Hehl aus seiner Antipathie zum Beispiel gegenüber dem Sparta-Chef Daniel Křetínský macht."	"Initial translation: Mr Paclík said that the aim was to curb the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which has led to unpleasant situations.

Analysis: The phrase ""was bis in widerwärtige Situationen ausartet"" should be ""leading to disgusting situations"" not ""which has led to unpleasant situations"" - ""widerwärtige"" is stronger than ""unpleasant

Corrected translation: ""To limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, leading to disgusting situations,"" Paclík said. He does not hide his antipathy for, e.g. Sparta's Director, Daniel Křetínský."	error_correction

"Translate the following German to English:
Ein dauerhafter mobiler Aufbau kann aber zu gefährlich oder aufwendig sein."	"Initial translation: However, a permanent mobile build-up can be too dangerous or too expensive.

Analysis: The German ""dauerhafter mobiler Aufbau"" should be interpreted as ""assembling and unassembling the speed camera at these points"" not ""permanent mobile build-up"" - the context is about speed cameras, and the target explains the specific action. The model completely omitted the crucial context about speed cameras and the specific locations (""at these points""). The phrase ""aufwendig"" should be ""expensive"" which is correct, but the context of what is expensive was lost. The semantic meaning changed from speed camera deployment logistics to general construction

Corrected translation: It can also be too dangerous or expensive to keep assembling and unassembling the speed camera at these points."	error_correction

Ich bin manchmal, zumindest in indirekter Form, an den Verhandlungen über einige der Fischereiabkommen beteiligt, und es ist äußerst schwierig, den Lauf der Dinge genau vorauszusagen.

Trotzdem bewies er viel mehr Geschick, wenn er seine Mitspieler ins Spiel brachte, und es war ein Pass von Ibrahimovic, den Di Maria in einen Drehschuss verwandelte, welcher von Wiland in der 52. Minute am Pfosten vorbeigelenkt wurde ..."	"Initial translation: owever, he was much more skilful in involving his team-mates and it was an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria converted into a scissor kick which Wiland deflected off the post in the 52nd minute...

Analysis: This translation has multiple serious issues. The opening word is missing the ""H"" from ""However"" indicating a truncation error. The German ""Drehschuss"" should be ""curling shot"" not ""scissor kick"" - these are completely different types of football shots. The phrase ""von Wiland...vorbeigelenkt wurde"" should be ""was tipped around the post by Wiland"" not ""deflected off the post"" - ""tipped around"" indicates goalkeeper skill, while ""deflected off"" suggests accidental contact. The translation appears incomplete with trailing ellipsis. The timing should be ""on 52 minutes"" not ""in the 52nd minute"" following football conventions

Corrected translation: Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Vor allem: Wo soll die Bauernmarkthalle während der Bauzeit hin?"	"Initial translation: Above all, where is the farmers' market going to be during the construction period?

Analysis: The phrase ""Vor allem"" was translated as ""Above all"" when ""In particular"" is more appropriate for this questioning context.  The construction ""soll. . . hin"" asking about location was simplified, losing some of the directional nuance.  The model understood the basic question but missed architectural and contextual precision

Corrected translation: In particular: Where should the covered market go while construction is ongoing?"	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Durch die nach wie vor bestehenden Unterschiede beim Arbeitsentgelt und bei den Renten sind Frauen besonders anfällig gegenüber den Folgen einer Aufweichung der öffentlichen Gesundheitssysteme und der kaum vorhandenen Betreuung alter Menschen."

Das sehen die überraschenden Pläne der Krankenhaus GmbH des Landkreises vor, die Landrätin Andrea Jochner-Weiß bestätigte."	"Initial translation: This is what the surprising plans of the hospital company of the district are, which was confirmed by the district president, Andrea Jochner-Weiß.

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""Das sehen...vor"" should be ""This allows for"" not ""This is what...are"" - different grammatical construction. The phrase ""Krankenhaus GmbH des Landkreises"" should be ""district's limited company hospital"" not ""hospital company of the district"" - the target emphasizes the legal structure (GmbH = limited company). The phrase ""Landrätin"" should be ""district administrator"" not ""district president"" - different administrative title. The phrase ""bestätigte"" should be ""confirms"" not ""was confirmed"" - different voice and tense

Corrected translation: This allows for the district's limited company hospital's surprising plans, confirms district administrator Andrea Jochner-Weiss."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
""Etwas einzugrenzen bedeutet immer, den nächsten Schritt festzulegen"", d.h. ihn zu überschreiten."	"Initial translation: To limit something means to define the next step, which is to go beyond it.

Analysis: The German ""einzugrenzen"" was translated as ""to limit"" when ""limiting"" (gerund form) would match the target structure better. The phrase ""festzulegen"" means ""setting up"" rather than ""define,"" and ""überschreiten"" means ""overcoming"" not ""go beyond it

Corrected translation: ""Limiting something is setting up the next step,"" meaning, overcoming."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Aus der täglichen Praxis wissen wir außerdem: Wenn ein neumodisches Gerät mal wirklich dringend gebraucht wird, ist garantiert der Akku leer."	"Initial translation: We also know from daily practice that if a new-fangled piece of equipment is really needed, the battery is bound to be flat.

Analysis: The German ""neumodisches Gerät"" should be ""new model gadget"" not ""new-fangled piece of equipment"" - ""new model"" is more neutral while ""new-fangled"" is somewhat pejorative. The phrase ""mal wirklich dringend gebraucht wird"" should be ""need a new model gadget to urgently work"" not ""is really needed"" - the reference emphasizes the gadget working urgently, not just being needed. The phrase ""garantiert der Akku leer"" should be ""will almost certainly be empty"" not ""is bound to be flat"" - ""empty"" is more precise than ""flat"" for batteries, and ""almost certainly"" is more measured than ""bound to be

Corrected translation: From everyday experience, we also know: If you need a new model gadget to urgently work, the battery will almost certainly be empty."	error_correction

In erster Linie gilt es sich jedoch in der Deckung zu steigern, die zuletzt alles andere als einen sicheren Eindruck hinterlassen hat."	"Initial translation: First and foremost, however, it is necessary to improve the coverage which has left a lot to be desired in recent years.

Analysis: The German ""Deckung"" in sports context should be ""cover play"" not just ""coverage"" - this is tactical terminology. The phrase ""zuletzt"" means ""recently"" not ""in recent years"" - this changes the timeframe. The idiom ""alles andere als einen sicheren Eindruck hinterlassen hat"" should be ""left much to be desired"" which the model got partially right but with wrong timeframe

Corrected translation: However, the top priority is to improve our cover play, which has recently left much to be desired."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Es war fast, als hätte mir jemand den Kopf endlich richtig aufgesetzt."	"Initial translation: It was almost as if someone had finally put my head straight.

Analysis: The German ""endlich richtig aufgesetzt"" should be ""had my head put on straight for me"" not ""put my head straight"" - the target uses the specific idiomatic expression ""put on straight for me"" which includes the assistance aspect. The phrase ""mir...aufgesetzt"" should be ""for me"" not omitted - this emphasizes that someone else did this action for the speaker. The model's version is close but misses the exact idiomatic phrasing and the ""for me"" element that indicates external help

Corrected translation: It's almost like I had my head put on straight for me."	error_correction
"Translate the following German to English:
Ohne die Einwanderer zu integrieren, ist es nicht möglich, dass 40 Millionen Menschen, die hierher gekommen sind, um bei uns zu leben, dies auch unter gleichen Bedingungen tun können."
