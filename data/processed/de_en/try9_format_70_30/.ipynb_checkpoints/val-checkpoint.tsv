An diesem Ort blieb er 49 Tage nach einem zweiten Haftbefehl, nachdem der Beamte des Ministerio Público die Straftaten wegen Bestechung und organisierten Verbrechens verworfen hatte.	"Initial translation: He was there 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office, after the Public Prosecutor had rejected the charges of bribery and organised crime.

Analysis: The German ""nach einem zweiten Haftbefehl"" should be ""following the pronunciation of a second restriction order"" not ""after a second arrest warrant"" - the target uses different legal terminology. The phrase ""nachdem der Beamte des Ministerio Público die Straftaten...verworfen hatte"" should be ""after the prosecutor dismissed the crimes"" not ""after the Public Prosecutor had rejected the charges"" - while similar, the target uses ""dismissed"" and ""crimes"" rather than ""rejected"" and ""charges

Corrected translation: In this place he remained for 49 days following the pronunciation of a second restriction order after the prosecutor dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime."	error_correction
Obwohl der Bücherberg unter einem Glassturz steht, scheint die Sonne selbst an sonnigen Tagen nur kurz ins Innere.	"Initial translation: Although the Book Mountain is on the verge of collapse, the sun itself seems to shine only for a short time even on sunny days.

Analysis: The German ""unter einem Glassturz steht"" should be ""has a glass cover"" not ""is on the verge of collapse"" - completely opposite meaning from protection to destruction. The word ""Glassturz"" is a glass cover/dome, not structural failure. The phrase ""scheint die Sonne selbst an sonnigen Tagen nur kurz ins Innere"" should be ""the sun only shines only briefly into the interior, even on sunny days"" not ""the sun itself seems to shine only for a short time even on sunny days"" - missing the ""into the interior"" location and wrong verb emphasis. The model completely misunderstood the structural situation, turning protective covering into imminent collapse

Corrected translation: Although the Bücherberg has a glass cover, the sun only shines only briefly into the interior, even on sunny days."	error_correction
"Kleine Parzellen belegen dort heute keine Landwirte mehr - sondern Kleingärtner der Anlage ""Land in Sonne""."	"Initial translation: Small plots of land are no longer farmed there - but are used by the 'Land in the Sun' gardening scheme.

Analysis: The German ""Land in Sonne"" should be preserved as ""Land in Sonne"" not translated to ""Land in the Sun"" - this is a proper name that should be kept in the original. The phrase ""Kleingärtner der Anlage"" should be ""allotment holders of the...facility"" not ""gardening scheme"" - the target uses more specific terminology. The word ""belegen"" should be ""occupy"" not ""farmed"" - this is about occupation/usage, not farming

Corrected translation: Today, it is no longer farmers who occupy small parcels there – rather, it is allotment holders of the ""Land in Sonne"" facility."	error_correction

Es ist schon fast ein rekurrentes Thema, auf das zwei Mitglieder dieser alt eingesessenen Kaste, die sich im Aufzug treffen, zurückgreifen können.	"Initial translation: It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this old established caste can meet in the lift.

Analysis: The German ""auf das...zurückgreifen können"" should be ""to make use of when"" not just ""that...can meet"" - this is about utilizing a conversational topic, not just meeting. The phrase ""die sich im Aufzug treffen"" should be ""recognize themselves in an elevator"" not ""meet in the lift"" - this is about recognition/identification, not arrangement to meet. The word ""Kaste"" should be ""ancient lineage of elected persons"" not just ""caste"" - the target is more specific about the political context. The model simplified the complex interaction to a basic meeting

Corrected translation: It's almost a recurrent theme to make use of when two members of this ancient lineage of elected persons recognize themselves in an elevator."	error_correction
Dazwischen gab es immer wieder längere Anstiege, für die lange Trials belohnten.	"Initial translation: There were long periods of time when the market was rising, and long trials were rewarded.

Analysis: The German ""längere Anstiege"" should be ""long uphill climbs"" not ""long periods of time when the market was rising"" - this is a major semantic error where the model confused hiking/climbing context with financial markets. The phrase ""für die lange Trials belohnten"" should be ""for which long trials were the reward"" not ""and long trials were rewarded"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the causal relationship. The German is talking about hiking/climbing challenges, not financial markets. The model completely misunderstood the context

Corrected translation: In between, there were time and again long uphill climbs, for which long trials were the reward."	error_correction
Danach gibt es in Kaiseringen im Schulhaus Kaffee, Kuchen, kühle Getränke, Saitenwürste und Käsewecken.	"Initial translation: Then there is coffee, cake, cold drinks, sausages and cheese in Kaiseringen in the school building.

Analysis: The German ""Saitenwürste"" should be ""Viennese sausages"" not just ""sausages"" - this is a specific type of sausage. The phrase ""Käsewecken"" should be ""cheese rolls"" not just ""cheese"" - the bread component is missing. The phrase ""Danach gibt es"" should be ""Afterwards there will be"" not ""Then there is"" - different temporal structure and future tense. The word order should place location information differently for natural English flow

Corrected translation: Afterwards there will be coffee, cakes, cold drinks, Viennese sausages and cheese rolls."	error_correction
Das Betriebssystem erfüllt die Funktion, die mit der Funktion seiner Ehefrau oder seines Ehemannes verglichen werden kann, wenn es darum geht, seiner Schwiegermutter etwas mitzuteilen.	"Initial translation: The operating system is like the wife or husband of a person who is trying to tell his mother-in-law something.

Analysis: The German structure should be ""It performs the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law"" - the model added unnecessary words and changed the direct comparison. The phrase ""die mit der Funktion seiner Ehefrau oder seines Ehemannes verglichen werden kann"" should emphasize the functional comparison, not create a metaphorical likeness. The model made the comparison more awkward and less direct than the original meaning

Corrected translation: It performs the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law."	error_correction

"Die Studenten hätten ""Anspruch, Spielräume zu erhalten, die Eigeninitiative ermöglichen und fördern""."	"Initial translation: The students would have 'claims to have room to manoeuvre and to be able to take initiative'.

Analysis: The German ""hätten Anspruch"" should be ""are entitled"" not ""would have claims"" - this is a grammatical error where the model changed the modal structure. The phrase ""Spielräume zu erhalten"" should be ""to be granted leeway"" not ""to have room to manoeuvre"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a more complex phrase. The German ""die Eigeninitiative ermöglichen und fördern"" should be ""allowing and promoting initiative"" not ""to be able to take initiative"" - the model missed that the leeway itself should enable initiative, not that students should be able to take it

Corrected translation: The students are ""entitled to be granted leeway allowing and promoting initiative""."	error_correction

Wieder umzuschalten auf die Gegenwart ist ein böses Erwachen, als ob man aus einem Traum gerissen wird.	"Initial translation: To wake up again to the present is a bad dream, as if you have been dragged out of a dream.

Analysis: The German ""umzuschalten"" should be ""cutting to"" not ""to wake up again to"" - this is about switching/cutting scenes (like film editing), not waking up. The phrase ""böses Erwachen"" should be ""rude awakening"" not ""bad dream"" - these are opposite concepts (awakening vs staying in dream). The phrase ""als ob man aus einem Traum gerissen wird"" should be ""like snapping out of a dream"" not ""as if you have been dragged out of a dream"" - the target emphasizes sudden breaking

Corrected translation: Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream."	error_correction
Neben der Einstellung der Steife der Federleisten werden auch spezielle flexible Schultermodule geboten.	"Initial translation: In addition to the stiffening of the spring, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.

Analysis: The German ""Federleisten"" was translated as ""spring"" when it should be ""slats"" in this bedding/furniture context. ""Einstellung der Steife"" means ""adjusting the stiffness"" not ""stiffening,"" and the model missed that this is about bed slat adjustment. The phrase ""shoulder cradle"" was translated literally as ""shoulder modules"" instead of understanding it as the specific product name ""shoulder cradle

Corrected translation: In addition to adjusting the stiffness of slats you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle."	error_correction
Denn blöder als bislang geht es nicht: Sommerferien, Hitze und Landtagswahlkampf - das beißt sich.	"Initial translation: Because it is not going to get any worse than this: summer holidays, heat and state election campaigns - it is a tough time.

Analysis: The German ""blöder als bislang geht es nicht"" was mistranslated as ""it is not going to get any worse than this"" when it should be ""The way things had been going was simply ridiculous"", completely changing the meaning from criticism of past ridiculousness to prediction about future difficulty. The phrase ""das beißt sich"" was translated as ""it is a tough time"" instead of ""they clash with one another"", losing the specific meaning of conflicting elements. The word ""Landtagswahlkampf"" should be ""state parliament elections"" not ""state election campaigns"" to be more precise

Corrected translation: The way things had been going was simply ridiculous: summer holidays, heat and state parliament elections - they clash with one another."	error_correction

Statt sich mit den Argumenten und Forderungen der Studierenden auseinanderzusetzen, habe man geräumt.	"Initial translation: Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have been evicted.

Analysis: The German ""sich mit den Argumenten und Forderungen der Studierenden auseinanderzusetzen"" should be ""taking the students' arguments and students seriously"" not ""dealing with the arguments and demands of the students"" - this is a grammatical error where the model changed the structure. The phrase ""habe man geräumt"" should be ""they organised this vacation"" not ""they have been evicted"" - this is a semantic error where the model confused who was doing the evicting. The German construction indicates that instead of engaging with students, the authorities chose to clear/evacuate the space

Meine Mutter und meine Schwester sahen das auch und machten sich vor Lachen fast in die Hose, aber ich musste in die Notaufnahme.	"Initial translation: My mother and sister saw it too and they were laughing so much they nearly fell off their chairs, but I had to go to the emergency department.

Analysis: The German idiom ""machten sich...fast in die Hose"" should be ""started wetting themselves"" not ""nearly fell off their chairs"" - this is about uncontrolled laughter leading to potential incontinence, not falling. The phrase ""musste in die Notaufnahme"" should be ""had to be rushed to A & E"" not just ""had to go to the emergency department"" - the reference implies urgency with ""rushed"" and uses British terminology ""A & E

Corrected translation: Then my mum and sister came to the realisation and they started wetting themselves, but I had to be rushed to A & E."	error_correction
Beide Mannschaften kombinierten langwierig und so wurde vor allem um die Mittellinie gespielt.	"Initial translation: Both teams played a long ball game and the midfield was the area where most of the action was.

Analysis: The German ""kombinierten langwierig"" was mistranslated as ""played a long ball game"" when it should be ""found it difficult to join in the combination"" - this misses the difficulty aspect entirely. The phrase ""vor allem um die Mittellinie gespielt"" should be ""the game remained around the mid-field line most of the time"" not ""the midfield was the area where most of the action was"" - the original implies stagnation, not action. The model completely reversed the intended meaning from teams struggling to combine to teams actively playing

Corrected translation: Both teams found it difficult to join in the combination; the game remained around the mid-field line most of the time."	error_correction

Die Masse macht's: Alle zwei Jahre zeigen die Autobauer auf der IAA ihre Neuheiten.	"Initial translation: The masses make it: every two years, the car manufacturers show off their new models at the IAA.

Analysis: The German ""Die Masse macht's"" should be ""The chassis makes the difference"" not ""The masses make it"" - this is a complete misunderstanding where ""Masse"" refers to automotive chassis/body mass, not crowds of people. The phrase ""zeigen...ihre Neuheiten"" should be ""present their new models"" not ""show off their new models"" - ""present"" is more formal and appropriate for trade shows. The model fundamentally misinterpreted the automotive technical context as being about crowd appeal rather than engineering

Die Deutsche Bahn in NRW kündigte an, alles zu tun, um die Auswirkungen möglichst gering zu halten.	"Initial translation: The German Railways in North Rhine-Westphalia announced that they would do everything possible to limit the effects.

The phrase ""alles zu tun, um die Auswirkungen möglichst gering zu halten"" should be ""they will do everything they can to ensure disruptions are kept to a minimum"" not ""they would do everything possible to limit the effects"" - wrong tense (will vs. would), wrong object (disruptions vs. effects), and wrong verb phrase (ensure...kept to minimum vs. limit).

"Initial translation: Since both the timber export and the turn-off worked in the current state of the expansion, Mr Haas argued against the change of the level crossing.

Analysis: The German ""Holzabfuhr"" should be ""transportation of wood"" not ""timber export"" - this is about local wood transport, not international export. ""Abbiegen"" should be ""turning"" not ""turn-off"" - it refers to the turning movement of vehicles, not an exit ramp. ""Ausbauzustand"" should be ""current state"" or ""as things are"" not ""state of the expansion"" - this refers to the existing condition. ""Umbau des Bahnübergangs"" should be ""reconstruction of the railway crossing"" not ""change of the level crossing"" - the scale of work is different

Das kennt jeder, der sich schon mal aufregen musste, weil das Auto-Navi statt einer Umgehungsstraße eine grüne Wiese anzeigte.	"Initial translation: Everyone knows that if you get excited about the car navigation system, it will show you a green field instead of a detour.

Analysis: The German ""sich aufregen musste"" means ""has ever got worked up"" (past experience) not ""if you get excited"" (conditional). The model completely misunderstood the causal relationship - it's not that getting excited causes the problem, but that the navigation problem causes people to get worked up.

The phrase ""beim Suchsdorfer SV sorgen"" was completely omitted - this should be ""that bring class and stability to Suchsdorfer SV

"Konzert der ""Studenten der samtenen Revolution"" mit Gesangsensembles der Karlsuniversität"	"Initial translation: Concert by the 'Students of the Velvet Revolution' with choirs from Charles University

Analysis: The model completely misunderstood the structure - ""UK's Choirs"" refers to the university choirs (UK = Univerzita Karlova/Charles University), not the country United Kingdom. The title structure was interpreted literally instead of understanding it as a concert title format. The German ""Gesangsensembles der Karlsuniversität"" should be understood as ""UK's Choirs"" in the context of the concert title

Er zerreißt sich für die Mannschaft, geht über Schmerzen drüber.	"Initial translation: He tears himself apart for the team, goes through pain.

Analysis: The German ""Er zerreißt sich für die Mannschaft"" should be ""He bends over backwards for the team"" not ""He tears himself apart for the team"" - while both convey extreme effort, ""bends over backwards"" is the proper English idiom for making extraordinary effort, while ""tears apart"" is too literal and violent. The phrase ""geht über Schmerzen drüber"" should be ""ignoring any pain"" not ""goes through pain"" - this is about disregarding pain, not experiencing it. The model's version suggests suffering while the reference suggests determination despite discomfort

Corrected translation: He bends over backwards for the team, ignoring any pain."	error_correction

"Initial translation: The beneficiaries of the 39-year-old hockey star's view were both Giroux, who added an assist and was named the game's best player.

Analysis: The German ""Nutznießer des Überblicks des neununddreißigjährigen Eishockeystars war in beiden Fällen Claude Giroux"" should be ""In both cases, Claude Giroux, used the experience of a thirty-nine year old star"" not ""The beneficiaries of the 39-year-old hockey star's view were both Giroux"" - Claude Giroux is the beneficiary, not multiple people, and it's about using someone else's experience. The phrase ""noch eine Assistenz hinzufügte"" should be ""he added an extra pass"" not ""added an assist"" - ""pass"" is more precise than ""assist"" in this context.

"Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden nach Last-Minute-Pleite ""am Boden zerstört"""	"Initial translation: Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden after last-minute collapse 'destroyed'

Analysis: The German ""Verbandsliga"" should be translated as ""Association League"" rather than left untranslated, as this is a specific German sports league classification. The word ""Pleite"" in sports context means ""loss/defeat"" not ""collapse"" which suggests structural failure rather than a game result. The phrase ""am Boden zerstört"" should be ""devastated"" rather than just ""destroyed"" to better convey the emotional state after a sports defeat. The model kept German sports terminology and misinterpreted the sports-specific language

Analysis: The German ""Gartenschuppen"" means ""garden shed"" not ""greenhouse"" - these are different structures. The phrase ""der einer betroffenen Frau einfiel"" means ""that the affected woman could think of"" not ""that a woman had with the organisation"" - the model misunderstood that this is about what came to mind, not organizational contact. The word ""betroffenen"" indicates she was a sufferer/victim, which was lost. The model added ""in the 1970s"" which doesn't appear in the German source

Corrected translation: In one case the only contact the woman sufferer could think of was pulling down a garden shed in the 1970s."	error_correction

Nicht wenige Promis trinken sich auch für die obligatorischen Gesangseinlagen Mut an.	"Initial translation: Not a few celebrities are also drinking to the obligatory singing.

Analysis: The German idiom ""sich Mut antrinken"" should be ""need the liquid courage"" not ""drinking to"" - the model lost the idiomatic meaning about drinking alcohol to gain courage for performance. The phrase ""obligatorischen Gesangseinlagen"" should be ""obligatory vocal number"" not ""obligatory singing"" - ""vocal number"" is more appropriate for entertainment performances. The opening ""Nicht wenige"" should be ""Quite a few"" not ""Not a few"" - the reference uses more natural English phrasing. The model misunderstood both the idiomatic expression and the entertainment context

Corrected translation: Quite a few celebs also need the liquid courage for the obligatory vocal number."	error_correction
Aber es schade auch niemandem aus anderen Ecken Deutschlands, einmal Angela Merkel zuzuhören.	"Initial translation: But it is no good for anyone in other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.

Analysis: The German ""schade auch niemandem"" means ""won't do any harm"" but the model translated it as ""is no good"" - this reverses the meaning from harmless to harmful. The phrase ""einmal...zuzuhören"" should be ""to listen...for once"" not just ""to listen"" - the ""once"" aspect suggests giving it a try. The name should be ""Angela Merkal"" not ""Angela Merkel"" according to the target's specific spelling

So etwa, als er einen Schuss von Ideye über die Latte lenkte (56.).	"Initial translation: For example, when he put a shot over the bar from the edge of the box (56).

Analysis: The German ""lenkte"" means ""steered/directed"" not ""put"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a less precise verb. The phrase ""von Ideye"" (from Ideye) was completely omitted, losing the player's name. The model added ""from the edge of the box"" which doesn't exist in the German text - this is an addition error.

The phrase ""Straßenmeistereien"" should be ""snowploughs"" not just ""road authorities"" - these are specific winter road maintenance crews. The term ""schlecht befahrbar"" means ""difficult to pass"" not just ""in a bad state"" - it's about passability, not general condition.

Analysis: '""
The German metaphor ""Einen Pickel im Gesicht können wir schließlich am besten selbstbewusst ertragen"" refers to ""a pimple on the face"" as a metaphor for minor problems, but the model translated this as ""scratches on our faces"" which changes it from a metaphor about accepting imperfections to literal physical damage.  The reference correctly interprets this as ""We should have the self-confidence to live with this problem"" - a general statement about problem acceptance.  The model also said ""animals"" when the reference specifies ""birds,"" and changed ""Information boards"" to ""Infotafels"" mixing languages

"""Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn"", rief mir einer der Sanitäter auf Anfrage zu und verschwand im Getümmel."	"Initial translation: That is what they are for, said one of the paramedics when I asked him, and he disappeared into the crowd.

Analysis: The German dialect ""Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn"" means ""It's the ones that can't take any more"" but was completely misunderstood as ""That is what they are for"" - losing the meaning about people who can't cope anymore. The German ""rief mir...zu"" should be ""shouted when I asked him about it"" not just ""said when I asked him"" - missing the urgency and specific reference (""about it""). The phrase ""im Getümmel"" should be ""in the crowd"" not ""into the crowd"" - the paramedic disappeared within the existing crowd, not moving into it.

The phrase ""einen Rassismus gegenüber"" should be ""the racism against"" not ""racism against"" - definite vs indefinite article.

Analysis: The German ""Nicht nur deshalb"" should be ""Therefore, for this reason and others"" not ""Not only for that reason"" - the target emphasizes positive reasoning rather than negative construction. The inversion ""have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written"" is awkward in English - it should be ""Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written"" for natural flow. The German title should include both the original German and English translation as shown in the target: ""(Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives)

The phrase ""ein schönes Festambiente erhalten"" should be ""had acquired a lovely festive ambience"" not ""had been given a lovely festival atmosphere"" - different verb and formality. The German ""Leckereien"" should be ""nice nibbles"" not just ""treats"" - more specific food terminology.

Alessandro Schöpf brachte die Heimequipe in der elften Minute nach starker Vorarbeit von Jewgeni Konopljanka per Kopf in Führung, in der Folge konservierten die Gastgeber das Minipolster mit einer kompakten Defensivleistung.	"Initial translation: Alessandro Schöpf put the home team ahead in the eleventh minute with a well-worked goal, and the hosts then kept the scoreboard ticking over with a solid defensive performance.

Analysis: The German should be ""secured the lead"" not ""put ahead

Corrected translation: Alessandro Schöpf secured the lead of the home team in the eleventh minute after heavy preparatory head work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, as a result of which the home team preserved the mini buffer with a solid defensive performance."	error_correction
Dies ist der Gegenstand von vier amerikanischen Forschungszentren, von denen eines nun scheinbar fast am Ziel angelangt ist.	"Initial translation: This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems to be almost there.

Und ich habe auch schon im offenen Ganztag an der Schule gearbeitet.	"Initial translation: I have also worked in a full-time job in a school.

Analysis: The German ""im offenen Ganztag an der Schule"" should be ""at the full-day school in their supplementary activities"" not ""in a full-time job in a school"" - this is a semantic error where the model confused ""offenen Ganztag"" (open all-day program) with full-time employment. The phrase ""offenen Ganztag"" refers to an extended school day program with supplementary activities, not a full-time job. The model simplified the specific educational concept to general employment terms

Corrected translation: And I have also worked at the full-day school in their supplementary activities."	error_correction
Die Bank hat sich seitdem distanziert, als sie vor acht Jahren fast kollabierte und gerettet werden musste.	"Initial translation: The Bank has since distanced itself from the situation, which it almost collapsed eight years ago.

Analysis: The grammatical structure ""which it almost collapsed"" is incorrect - should be ""since it nearly collapsed"" with proper temporal sequencing. The phrase ""sich distanziert"" should be ""has retreated from them"" not ""distanced itself from the situation"" - the reference indicates retreating from specific entities/policies, not a general situation. The crucial phrase ""und gerettet werden musste"" (and had to be bailed out) is completely omitted from the model's translation. The relative clause construction is malformed and creates confusion about what collapsed

Corrected translation: It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out."	error_correction

Gegen das wegen einer Gelb-roten Karte gegen Milos Veljkovic schon vor der Pause dezimierte Werder Bremen mussten die Stuttgarter zwischenzeitlich bangen.	"Initial translation: Stuttgart had to worry about a red card for Milos Veljkovic before the break, which had already reduced Bremen to ten men.

Analysis: The German sentence structure was completely reorganized incorrectly. The phrase ""Gegen das...dezimierte Werder Bremen mussten die Stuttgarter zwischenzeitlich bangen"" should be ""The Stuttgarters had to take fear of the Werder Bremen, which...had been reduced to a team of ten"" - the model confused who was worrying about whom. The phrase ""wegen einer Gelb-roten Karte"" should be ""because of a yellow-red card"" not just ""red card"" - the yellow-red distinction is important. The word ""dezimierte"" should be ""reduced to a team of ten"" not just ""reduced...to ten men"" to match target phrasing. The model reversed the subject-object relationship

Analysis: The German ""Zugezogene"" should be ""people who have moved in"" not ""newcomers"" - more specific. The phrase ""sich über Farbbomben ärgern"" should be ""irritated by paint bombs"" not ""angry about colour bombs"" - ""irritated"" is more precise, and ""paint bombs"" is more specific than ""colour bombs

"Ihre Aufwartung machten anschließend die Dreikönig- singer, die Hansjakob zu dem Ausruf veranlassten: ""Ach wie schön, da werden wieder Jugenderinnerungen an meine eigene Dreikönigzeit lebendig""."	"Initial translation: Their visit was followed by the Three Kings, who led Hansjakob to exclaim: 'Ah, how nice, that brings back memories of my own Three Kings time'.

Analysis: The German ""Dreikönig-singer"" should be ""Dreikönig singers"" not ""Three Kings"" - this preserves the specific German cultural term. The phrase ""Jugenderinnerungen"" should be ""childhood memories"" not just ""memories"" - the youth aspect is missing. The quote ""Ach wie schön"" should be ""Oh how beautiful"" not ""Ah, how nice"" - the target uses more emphatic language. The phrase ""wieder...lebendig"" should be ""back to life"" not just ""back"" - the revival aspect is missing

Freie Betten an allen Winterterminen bietet immer stets auch das Reisebüro Ingtours in Vrchlabi an.	"Initial translation: Free beds are always available at all winter terms at the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi.

Analysis: The German ""Freie Betten"" should be ""vacancies"" not ""Free beds"" - in tourism context, this is about room availability, not literal beds. The phrase ""an allen Winterterminen"" should be ""throughout the winter"" not ""at all winter terms"" - the target is more natural. The structure ""bietet immer stets auch"" should be ""is still offering"" not ""are always available"" - the emphasis is on the agency's continued service. The place name should be ""Vrchlabí"" with accent marks preserved

Corrected translation: The Vrchlabí travel agency Ingtours is still offering vacancies throughout the winter."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""nach dem Angriff auf die Küste über die 'Front am Gebirge' zu sprechen"" should be ""after approaching the coastline becomes 'necessary' to discuss about 'the mountain front'"" - the model misunderstood the temporal and causal relationships. The phrase ""der über die grünen Äpfel"" should be ""that of green apples"" referring to Cerda's speech topic, not describing Cerda himself as ""the green apple

Analysis: The station name ""Puorta Nuova"" was changed to ""Porta Nuova"" - while this might be a correction, proper names should typically remain as given. The phrase ""Busparkplatz"" should be ""parking lot for buses"" not ""bus park"" for more natural English. The Italian phrase ""destinazione Monaco, festa della birra"" should be kept in Italian with backticks as in the target, not translated to English.

Analysis: The German ""mit einem Augenzwinkern"" (with a wink) is completely omitted, which removes the playful tone of the statement. The phrase ""so eine Wohngemeinschaft"" should be ""this type of residential community"" not ""a shared house"" - the target uses more formal terminology.

"Initial translation: Söllner read out a statement in which he admitted to working as an informer for the Romanian secret service, the Securitate, among other writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.

Analysis: The German ""Sichtlich verunsichert und verlegen"" meaning ""Clearly unsettled and embarrassed"" was completely omitted from the translation. The phrase ""vor rumäniendeutschen Schriftstellerkollegen"" should be ""before Romano-German writer colleagues"" not just ""among other writers"" - the model lost the specific ethnic/cultural designation and the formal ""before"" relationship. The word ""IM"" (informant/informer) was translated as ""informer"" which is acceptable, but the formal context was lost

Analysis: The German ""fliegendem Rock"" should be ""frilly skirt"" not ""flying skirt"" - this is about ruffled/frilly fabric, not airborne movement. The phrase ""drapierten Oberteil"" should be ""draped 'corsage'"" not ""draped top"" - the target uses specific fashion terminology. The phrase ""einem Dekolleté, das seinem Namen Ehre macht"" should be ""a strapless neckline"" not ""a décolleté that did justice to its name"" - the target simplifies and specifies the neckline type.

Analysis: The German ""Es gab erhebliche Überschreitungen"" was translated as ""significant overruns"" while the reference uses ""considerable infringements"" - both could be correct depending on context (budget overruns vs rule violations). However, the model completely omitted the second part of the sentence ""der sich selbst mal vor Ort über die Lage kundig machte"" (who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on) - this is significant contextual information about King's personal investigation that was entirely lost.

The phrase ""die Torwart Roberto mit dem Knie parierte"" should be ""which the goalie parried with his knee"" not ""Roberto saved with his knee"" - this is a semantic error where the model made Roberto the subject when he should be identified as the goalkeeper.

The phrase ""Ein Traumwetter"" should be ""perfect weather"" not ""A dream weather"" - grammatical issue with article and word choice. The phrase ""Tennisabteilung"" should be ""tennis division"" not ""tennis section"" - different organizational terminology. The target includes explanation ""(Rohrdorf Sports Fans)"" which is omitted.

"Initial translation: A typical example: when overtaking or passing close to oncoming vehicles, one may 'touch' the other car lightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations, one may spin out of control.

Analysis: The German sentence structure has two distinct parts, but the model omits the key second sentence. The phrase ""an manchen Stellen den anderen Wagen nur leicht"" should be ""you sometimes lightly touch the other car"" not ""touch the other car lightly in some places"" - ""Stellen"" refers to occasions, not physical locations. The second part ""in anderen, nahezu identischen Situation kommt man aber ins Schleudern und dreht wilde Pirouetten"" should be ""Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes"" - the model captured this but lost the structural separation and the ""wild pirouettes"" reference.

Ich denke, daß wir der Tatsache Aufmerksamkeit schenken sollten, daß die Europäische Union solch ein Embargo nie gebilligt, sondern sich für das Gespräch und Überzeugungsarbeit ausgesprochen hat, um einen Wandel in Europa zu begünstigen.	"Initial translation: I think that it is worthwhile drawing attention to the fact that the European Union never endorsed such a boycott, preferring discussion and persuasion as a means of trying to seek change within Europe.

Gewiss muss die Politik der Europäischen Union eine Politik der Friedensförderung sein, aber mehr noch und vor allem eine Politik der Demokratieförderung.

Kurz vor Torschluss am Montag waren es noch 9380 gewesen.	"Initial translation: Just before the final whistle on Monday, there were still 9380.

Analysis: The German ""Torschluss"" should be ""closing of the gate"" not ""final whistle"" - while both suggest deadlines, ""Torschluss"" literally means gate closure and is used metaphorically for deadline, whereas ""final whistle"" is specifically sports terminology. The phrase ""waren es noch"" should be ""the number was"" not ""there were still"" - the target emphasizes the specific count more formally

Corrected translation: Shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday the number was 9,380."	error_correction
Aber das Zeichen vom Coach konnte Kimmich auch so deuten.	"Initial translation: But the coach's sign could also be interpreted as a sign of Kimmich.

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""konnte Kimmich auch so deuten"" should be ""Kimmich could also interpret...as follows"" not ""could also be interpreted as a sign of Kimmich"" - the model completely changed who is doing the interpreting and what is being interpreted. The phrase ""das Zeichen vom Coach"" should be ""the signal from the coach"" not ""the coach's sign"" - ""signal"" is more specific than ""sign

Corrected translation: But Kimmich could also interpret the signal from the coach as follows."	error_correction
Daß er darin die Ursache für die organisierte Kriminalität und für gesellschaftliche Probleme sieht, ist wirklich empörend.	"Initial translation: The fact that he quotes this as a cause of organised crime and social problems is truly appalling.

"Er habe ihn in allen für ihn damals diffizilen Punkten ""herausgehauen"", so Markel."	"Initial translation: He has 'come through' in all the difficult areas for him, said Mr Markel.

Analysis: The German ""herausgehauen"" should be ""boxed him out"" not ""come through"" - completely different meaning involving aggressive protection vs personal achievement. The phrase ""in allen für ihn damals diffizilen Punkten"" should be ""in all points which were dangerous for him at the time"" not ""in all the difficult areas for him"" - ""dangerous"" is stronger than ""difficult"" and the temporal ""at the time"" is more precise. The name should be ""Markel"" not ""Mr Markel"" according to the target

Corrected translation: He ""boxed him out"" in all points which were dangerous for him at the time, said Markel."	error_correction
Kinder hocken an ihren Köpfen, registrieren das gefälschte Blut und die stillen Körper und flüstern einander zu.	"Initial translation: Children huddle around their heads, registering the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whispering to each other.

Analysis: The German ""hocken an"" means ""crouch by"" not ""huddle around"" - it's about positioning, not grouping. The phrase ""gefälschte Blut"" should be ""fake blood"" not ""falsified blood"" - it's about special effects, not deception. The verb ""registrieren"" was correctly translated as noting/taking in, but ""take in"" is more natural than ""registering"" in this context. The model captured the scene but could improve precision and naturalness

Corrected translation: Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other."	error_correction
Es ist Aufgabe der politisch Verantwortlichen der verschiedenen Mitgliedsstaaten, unabhängige, in diese Richtung gehende Aktionen zu unterstützen.	"Initial translation: Political leaders in the various Member States have a responsibility to encourage independent approaches along these lines.

Mit 60 Jahren als Sänger ist Hubert Wermters Geschichte beim Männergesangverein Cäcilia fast doppelt so lange wie die des Herbsfestes, in dessen Rahmen er feierlich geehrt wurde.	"Initial translation: Hubert Wermters' story with the men's choir Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the herb festival, in which he was honoured with great ceremony.

Analysis: The German ""Herbsfestes"" appears to be ""Herbstfestes"" (Autumn Festival) but was translated as ""herb festival"" - this is likely a misreading or OCR error where ""Herbst"" (autumn) was seen as ""Herb"" (herb). The phrase ""Mit 60 Jahren als Sänger"" (Having been a singer for 60 years) was omitted from the model's translation, losing important context about his long career. The reference correctly identifies this as ""Autumn Festival"" and includes the 60-year detail. The possessive ""Wermters'"" should be ""Wermter's"" for proper English grammar

Corrected translation: Having been a singer for 60 years, Hubert Wermter's story with the Cäcilia Male Choral Society is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, during which he was ceremonially honoured."	error_correction
Ja, das würde ich tun, wenn er mir unsympathisch ist oder ich ihm eins auswischen will.	"Initial translation: Yes, I would do that if I do not like him or if I want to give him a slap.

Analysis: The German idiom ""ihm eins auswischen"" means ""to get back at someone"" or ""to get one over on someone"", but was literally translated as ""give him a slap"" which changes the meaning from psychological revenge to physical violence. The phrase ""wenn er mir unsympathisch ist"" should be ""if I didn't like somebody"" not ""if I do not like him"" - the reference uses the more natural indefinite pronoun. The overall tone is more awkward and direct compared to the natural English reference

Corrected translation: I would do it if I didn't like somebody, or they made me want to do it."	error_correction
Vorgesehen ist eine Prämie von 1000 Euro für die bestandene Meisterprüfung und 2500 Euro, wenn sich Absolventen innerhalb von zehn Jahren nach der Meisterausbildung selbstständig machen.	"Initial translation: The premium is EUR 1000 for the master's degree and EUR 2500 if graduates set up their own business within ten years of graduating.

Analysis: The German ""Prämie"" means ""prize/bonus"" but was translated as ""premium"" which has different connotations (insurance/subscription fee vs reward). The phrase ""Meisterprüfung"" means ""master craftsman examination"" but was simplified to ""master's degree"" - this loses the specific vocational/trade context of the German system. Similarly ""Meisterausbildung"" (master craftsman training) became just ""graduating"" losing the specialized training context. The reference preserves the specific craftsman terminology which is important for understanding the German vocational system

Corrected translation: A prize of 1000 euros is envisaged for passing the master craftsman examination, and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of their master craftsman training."	error_correction
Dettori sprüht Champagner nach einem Double bei Newmarket, der ihm 3.000ten Gewinn bringt	"Initial translation: Dettori is celebrating a double at Newmarket, his 3000th winner

Analysis: The German ""sprüht Champagner"" should be ""sprays champagne"" not omitted - this specific action is part of the celebration description. The phrase ""der ihm 3.000ten Gewinn bringt"" should be ""takes him to 3,000 wins"" not ""his 3000th winner"" - the model missed that this double at Newmarket specifically brings him to the 3,000 milestone. The model also changed ""sprüht"" (sprays) to generic ""celebrating"" losing the specific champagne-spraying detail

Corrected translation: Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins"	error_correction
Mancher träumt in der Midlife-Crisis von einer neuen Karriere, andere wagen sich einfach mal aufs glatte Eis ihrer vagen Sehnsüchte.	"Initial translation: Some dream of a new career in midlife crisis, others just go for a ride on the smooth ice of their vague desires.

Analysis: The phrase ""in der Midlife-Crisis"" should be ""to escape a mid-life crisis"" not ""in midlife crisis"" - it's about escaping the crisis, not happening during it. The German ""wagen sich einfach mal aufs glatte Eis"" is an idiom meaning ""venture onto thin ice"" or ""test their vague aspirations"" not literally ""go for a ride on smooth ice"". The model missed the metaphorical meaning about taking risks. The model also added ""of their vague desires"" which doesn't appear in the German source

Corrected translation: Many dream of a new career to escape a mid-life crisis; others come to test their vague aspirations against the cold facts."	error_correction
Das ist eine von jenen Katastrophenmeldungen, auf die wir Menschen so gerne anspringen.	"Initial translation: This is one of those disasters that we humans are so keen to jump on.

Analysis: The German ""Katastrophenmeldungen"" should be ""startler"" not ""disasters"" - this is a lexical error where the model was too literal. The phrase ""anspringen"" should be ""latch on to"" not ""jump on"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a more literal translation. The German ""auf die wir Menschen so gerne anspringen"" carries the meaning of being attracted to sensational news, not literally jumping on disasters. The model also missed the nuance that these are news reports about disasters, not actual disasters

Corrected translation: It is just another startler, which we like to latch on to."	error_correction

"""Er ist fast verblutet, war ohnmächtig, hat sich dann raus geschleppt auf die Straße - das hat er uns so erzählt letzte Woche"", zitiert die ""WiWo"" SAP-Mitbegründer Hasso Plattner."	"Initial translation: He was almost dead, he was unconscious, he dragged himself out onto the street - that is what he told us last week, according to the WiWo.

Analysis: The German ""fast verblutet"" means ""almost bled to death"" not just ""almost dead"" - the specific cause (bleeding) was omitted. The phrase ""zitiert die 'WiWo' SAP-Mitbegründer Hasso Plattner"" should be ""the 'WiWo' quoted SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner"" - the model restructured this as ""according to the WiWo"" which loses the specific attribution to Hasso Plattner. The model simplified the medical specificity and altered the quotation attribution structure

Corrected translation: ""He almost bled to death, he was unconscious, then he dragged himself out onto the road - so he told us last week,"" the ""WiWo"" quoted SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner."	error_correction
Und wem es nur ums Raten geht und nicht um Siegpunkte, der kann auch leicht eine Version für zwei dazuerfinden.	"Initial translation: And if anyone is only interested in scoring points and not in paying, they can easily find a version for two.

Analysis: The model completely misunderstood ""ums Raten"" which means ""about guessing"" not ""scoring points,"" and ""nicht um Siegpunkte"" means ""not about winning"" not ""not paying

Corrected translation: And if it's all about guessing and not about winning, it's easy to play a version for two."	error_correction

Eine Regierung, welche die Staatsverschuldung verschweigt, Wahlen und eine neue Regierung, die am gleichen Strang zieht.	"Initial translation: A government which hides the national debt, elections and a new government which is on the same wavelength.

Analysis: The German ""Staatsverschuldung"" was translated as ""national debt"" when it should be ""public deficit"" in this political context. The idiomatic phrase ""am gleichen Strang zieht"" was translated as ""on the same wavelength"" but should be ""pulls up the rug"", which conveys a different meaning about revealing or exposing something rather than agreement. The model missed the political metaphor about uncovering hidden information

Corrected translation: A Government which hides the public deficit, elections and a new Government that pulls up the rug."	error_correction
Dem stehen jedoch die Haushaltskürzungen entgegen, die vor allem die Frauen im öffentlichen Dienst betreffen.	"Initial translation: In direct opposition to this concept are the budget cutbacks which affect in particular women in the civil service.

Die Bahn macht mit, auch weil die Risiken des größten Infrastruktur-Einzelprojekts der Republik der Steuerzahler und nicht der Staatskonzern trägt.	"Initial translation: The railways are also involved, because the risks of the biggest infrastructure project of the public and not of the State-owned companies.

Analysis: The German ""Die Bahn"" should be ""German Rail"" not ""The railways"" - this refers specifically to Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company. The phrase ""der Steuerzahler"" should be ""the taxpayer"" not ""the public"" - this is more specific. The phrase ""der Staatskonzern trägt"" should be ""the state company"" not ""State-owned companies"" (plural vs singular). The grammar ""will be borne by"" is missing - the model doesn't show the future passive construction properly

Corrected translation: German Rail is participating, also because the risks of the Republic's biggest single infrastructure project will be borne by the taxpayer and not the state company."	error_correction
Um 19 Uhr gestaltet die biraböhmische Blasmusik aus Schömberg den großen Unterhaltungsabend.	"Initial translation: At 7 p.m. the biraböhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg will provide the entertainment.

Analysis: The model completely omitted the extensive explanation that ""biraböhmische"" is ""a play on words alluding to the regions pear trees, Bohemia, and perhaps their love of beer as well!"" This explanation is crucial for understanding the wordplay. The phrase ""gestaltet...den großen Unterhaltungsabend"" should be ""provide a great evening of entertainment"" not just ""provide the entertainment"" - missing the ""great"" qualifier. The time should be ""19:00"" not ""7 p.m

Corrected translation: At 19:00, the ""biraböhmische"" (a play on words alluding to the regions pear trees, Bohemia, and perhaps their love of beer as well!) wind music group from Schömberg, provide a great evening of entertainment."	error_correction
"""Uns ist allen ein riesiger Stein vom Herzen gefallen"", sagte Schöpf, der daran mit seinem Kopfballtreffer keinen unwesentlichen Anteil hatte: ""Dabei bin ich eigentlich der schlechteste Kopfballspieler in der Mannschafft""."	"Initial translation: Schöpf, who scored with a header, said: 'We all felt a great sadness, because I am actually the worst header of the ball in the team'.

Analysis: The German ""ein riesiger Stein vom Herzen gefallen"" should be ""felt a huge weight lifted off our shoulders"" not ""felt a great sadness"" - this idiom means relief, not sadness. The phrase ""keinen unwesentlichen Anteil hatte"" should be ""played no insignificant part"" not omitted - this means he played a significant role. The structure should start with the relief quote, then explain Schöpf's role. The word ""Kopfballspieler"" should be ""header"" (player who heads the ball) not ""header of the ball

Corrected translation: We all felt a huge weight lifted off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whose scoring header played no insignificant part: ""And I am actually the worst header on the team."""	error_correction
