Die gestiegenen Kosten pro Einheit sind immer noch geringer als bei derzeit verwendeten Maschinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe.	"Initial translation: The increased cost per unit is still less than the cost of the current ten-seater aircraft.

Analysis: The German ""Die gestiegenen Kosten pro Einheit sind immer noch geringer als bei derzeit verwendeten Maschinen"" means the increased costs are still lower than current machines, but the model added ""the cost of"" making it ""less than the cost of current...aircraft"" which changes the comparison structure. The phrase ""Maschinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe"" means ""machines with ten seats per row"" but was translated as ""ten-seater aircraft"" - this loses the crucial detail about seats per row vs total seats. The reference uses ""10-abreast"" which correctly captures the row seating arrangement. The model's version suggests total aircraft capacity rather than seating configuration

Corrected translation: The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use."	error_correction
Daher müssen gemeindliche Wohnungen ertüchtigt werden, wie es so schön heißt.	"Initial translation: Therefore, municipal housing must be upgraded, as it is so beautifully put.

Analysis: The German ""gemeindliche"" was translated as ""municipal"" when it should be ""commune's"" to maintain the specific political context. The phrase ""ertüchtigt werden"" was translated as ""upgraded"" when ""beefed up"" is the more colloquial equivalent that matches the tone. The phrase ""wie es so schön heißt"" was translated as ""so beautifully put"" when ""so neatly put"" better captures the slightly ironic tone

Corrected translation: This is why the commune's homes need to be beefed up, as it is so neatly put."	error_correction
Und dann würden wir uns jetzt nicht hinter dem Seidenvorhang gefangen sehen - mit einem angenehmen Leben in den Vereinigten Staaten, aber doch irgendwie verloren.	"Initial translation: And then we would not be stuck behind the veil - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.

Analysis: The German ""Seidenvorhang"" should be ""silk curtain"" not ""veil"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a less precise word. The phrase ""gefangen sehen"" should be ""find ourselves trapped"" not ""be stuck"" - the model simplified the reflexive construction. The German ""aber doch irgendwie verloren"" should be ""but lost souls nonetheless"" not ""but somehow lost"" - the model lost the emphasis and nuance of the original

Corrected translation: And we wouldn't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless."	error_correction

Doch nicht nur bei der Infrastruktur - auch bei internationalen Handelsabkommen sind die beiden Konkurrenten nicht allzu weit voneinander entfernt.	"Initial translation: Not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.

Analysis: The German sentence structure should be rendered more fluently as ""But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of international trade agreements as well"" rather than the stilted parallel construction. The word ""Konkurrenten"" should be ""candidates"" not ""competitors"" in political context. The phrase ""nicht allzu weit voneinander entfernt"" should be expanded to ""taking a rather similar stance...they agree"" rather than the literal ""not too far apart"" which is less natural in English political discourse

Fortuna soll der Legende nach allen hold sein, die die Wände in der Gasse mit ihrem Sternzeichen berühren.	"Initial translation: Fortuna is said to smile on all who touch the walls of the street with their star sign.

Analysis: The German ""allen hold sein"" should be ""fortune will come to you"" not ""smile on all"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a different expression. The phrase ""die die Wände in der Gasse mit ihrem Sternzeichen berühren"" should be ""if you touch the walls on the street of your sign"" not ""who touch the walls of the street with their star sign"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the structure from conditional to relative clause. The German ""Gasse"" should be ""street"" which the model correctly translated, but the overall meaning about touching walls of your zodiac sign street is different from touching walls with your star sign

Corrected translation: They say, if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, fortune will come to you."	error_correction
Die Risikoaufschläge der Euro-Peripheriländer sind dramatisch gestiegen und die Aktien der europäischen Banken um mehr als 5%.	"Initial translation: The risk premiums of the euro peripheral countries have risen dramatically and the stocks of European banks have risen by more than 5%.

Analysis: The German ""Die Risikoaufschläge der Euro-Peripheriländer sind dramatisch gestiegen"" should be ""The differentials of peripherals have closed by force"" not ""have risen dramatically"" - completely different meaning and direction. The phrase ""dramatisch gestiegen"" in financial context should be interpreted as forced closure, not dramatic rise. The German ""die Aktien der europäischen Banken um mehr als 5%"" should be ""the rates of the European banks have raised more than 5%"" not ""stocks...have risen by more than 5%"" - the target uses ""rates"" not ""stocks"" and ""raised"" not ""risen

Corrected translation: The differentials of peripherals have closed by force and the rates of the European banks have raised more than 5%."	error_correction
"Und ganz vorne auf der Tribüne wehte einsam eine große Fahne mit Aufschrift ""Sektion Stadionverbot""."	"Initial translation: And at the front of the stand, all alone, was a large banner saying 'Section Stadionverbot'.

Analysis: The German ""wehte"" means ""blew in the wind"" but was completely omitted - this verb describes the flag's movement which adds visual detail. The word ""Fahne"" should be ""flag"" not ""banner"" - these are different objects with different connotations. The phrase ""Sektion Stadionverbot"" should be translated as ""Stadium Ban Section"" rather than left partially in German. The model lost the dynamic imagery of the flag moving in the wind

Corrected translation: And right at the front, on the stand, a single large flag with the text ""Stadium Ban Section"" blew in the wind."	error_correction

Wenn die Carodisten dem Präsidenen einen Strafzettel verpassen wollten, könnten sie dies tun, ohne Repressalien befürchten zu müssen.	"Initial translation: If the carodists wanted to give the President a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.

Analysis: The German ""Carodisten"" should be ""supporters of Carod"" not ""carodists"" - this refers to political supporters, not a general group. The phrase ""einen Strafzettel verpassen"" should be ""carry certain vote of punishment"" not ""give a ticket"" - this is about political punishment, not traffic violations. The word ""Repressalien"" should be ""retaliation"" not ""reprisals"" to match the target. The model completely misunderstood the political context and made it sound like traffic enforcement

Corrected translation: If the supporters of Carod want to carry certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do it without fear to retaliation."	error_correction

Der Graben, den der Berliner Innensenator und die Polizei zwischen Hausbesetzern und ihren Nachbarn aufmachen, existiert so offenbar nicht.	"Initial translation: The Berlin Senate and the police are not digging a trench between squatters and their neighbours.

Analysis: The German ""Der Graben, den der Berliner Innensenator und die Polizei zwischen Hausbesetzern und ihren Nachbarn aufmachen"" should be ""The schisms that Berlin's Senator for the Interior and the police believe to have opened up"" not ""are not digging a trench"" - this is about perceived social divisions, not literal excavation. The phrase ""existiert so offenbar nicht"" should be ""do not exist"" rather than ""are not digging

Analysis: The German ""einschläfern"" was translated as ""put you to sleep"" when in this medical context it means ""euthanise"" - this is a critical medical terminology error. The phrase ""dass meine Schmerzen gelindert werden"" was correctly translated as ""my pain to be alleviated,"" but the target simplifies the second part to just ""I want to be relieved

Dort ist sie nach Angaben der Behörde seit kurzem als Gebrauchsmuster geschützt.	"Initial translation: It is said to have been protected as a utility model by the authorities for some time now.

Analysis: The German ""Gebrauchsmuster"" should be ""registered design"" not ""utility model"" - these are different types of intellectual property protection. The phrase ""seit kurzem"" should be ""now"" not ""for some time now"" - this indicates recent action, not extended duration. The phrase ""nach Angaben der Behörde"" should be ""According to officials there"" not ""It is said...by the authorities"" which is more indirect. The model changed the timeframe and used less precise legal terminology

Corrected translation: According to officials there it is now protected as a registered design."	error_correction

"Initial translation: This sympathetic and intelligent young man, who has been punished by life, could work as a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he is a donkey.

Analysis: The phrase ""verrichtet er die Arbeit eines Tragesels"" should be ""he does the work of a mule"" not ""he is a donkey"" - the model lost the distinction between being something versus doing the work of something. The reference ""Punished for life"" better captures the permanent nature of ""vom Leben gestrafte"" compared to ""who has been punished by life"" which sounds more temporary. The word ""Tragesel"" should be ""mule"" not ""donkey"" - mules are specifically work animals, while donkeys are more general.

Analysis: The German ""mitmischen"" should be ""will not miss"" not ""mixing it with the best"" - this is about participation, not competitive mixing. The phrase ""erfreulich ist auch"" should be ""And Czech football will thus gain"" not ""and it is also good"" - this is about gaining revenue, not general positivity. The currency should be ""Czech Crowns"" not ""EUR"" as this is about Czech domestic football revenue. The model misunderstood both the participation context and the financial specifics

Corrected translation: The wonderful Petr Čech is one of the reasons the Czech representation team will not miss the next year's European Championship. And Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech Crowns."	error_correction
Am bayerischen Papst arbeiten sich ja viele, die ihn nie verstanden haben, noch immer eifrig ab.	"Initial translation: Many people in Bavaria are still working hard to get rid of the Pope they never understood.

Analysis: The German ""Am bayerischen Papst arbeiten sich ja viele, die ihn nie verstanden haben, noch immer eifrig ab"" was misunderstood - ""sich an jemandem abarbeiten"" means ""slaving away at understanding/analyzing someone,"" not ""working to get rid of"" them. The model interpreted this as wanting to remove the Pope rather than continuing to struggle with understanding him. The phrase ""bayerischen Papst"" should be ""Bavarian Pope"" (referring to Pope Benedict XVI), and the meaning is about ongoing intellectual effort to understand him, not opposition

Corrected translation: Indeed, lots of people are still slaving away assiduously on the Bavarian Pope who have never understood him."	error_correction
Auch in einigen Firmen sieht man grüne Sprossen sprießen, weshalb die Angestellten wieder eingeladen werden. Das vermittelt den Eindruck, dass die Gruppenessen wieder im Aufschwung sind.	"Initial translation: Even in some companies, green shoots are beginning to appear, so that employees are being invited back to the canteen, which gives the impression that the staff canteen is back on the up.

Analysis: The German text should be ""They also see green buds in some companies that invite their employees and the grater the volume the better"" - the model completely misunderstood the meaning and added information not present in the German. The phrase ""weshalb die Angestellten wieder eingeladen werden"" doesn't mean ""back to the canteen"" but relates to general employee invitations.

Analysis: The German ""offener Mercedes-Oldtimer"" means ""open vintage Mercedes"" but the model specified ""Mercedes-Benz 300 SL"" which is not mentioned in the German - this adds specific model information not present in the source. The phrase ""in dem die Rheintöchter...posieren"" means ""in which the Rhinemaidens pose"" but was translated as ""with the Rhine maidens"" losing the important detail that they are posing inside the car. The word ""Rockergirls"" means ""rocker girls"" but was translated as ""biker girls"" which has different connotations (motorcycle vs rock music culture).

"Ein Banker sagte, am Tegernsee gebe es ""eine Klientel, die vom Vermögen etwas üppiger ausgestattet ist""."	"Initial translation: A banker said that there was a clientele in Tegernsee 'with a little more money'.

The phrase ""eine Klientel"" should be ""clientele who were"" not ""a clientele"" - the grammar and number agreement should match the target.

The phrase ""SCW-Jungen"" should be ""SCW boys"" not ""SCW youths"" - more specific terminology. The phrase ""dort startet noch"" should be ""which is where...is also starting"" not ""where...is still playing"" - starting vs playing, and ""also"" vs ""still

The term ""preiswert"" was translated as ""cheap"" when ""inexpensive"" would be more appropriate and less negative.

Analysis: The German ""wie menschliche Packtiere beladen mit"" should be ""carrying, like human mules,"" not ""carrying human pack animals"" - the model misunderstood the simile structure. The phrase ""gebügelten T-Shirts"" should be ""pressed shirts"" not just ""T-shirts"" - the ironing detail is important. The phrase ""auf ihren Schultern liegenden Joch-ähnlichen Stange"" should be ""from a yoke across their shoulders"" not ""around their necks"" - the location is wrong and dangerous.

The phrase ""lädt in die Manege auf dem Ziegel­wasen zum Träumen ein"" should be ""is issuing an invitation to dream in the ring at the Ziegelwasen"" not ""is inviting us to dream in the big top on the Ziegelwiese"" - this is a semantic error where the model simplified the formal invitation structure.

Analysis: The German ""Ohne große Anstrengung"" should be ""Without playing a great match"" not omitted - this is an omission error. The phrase ""erspielten sich"" should be ""created"" not ""had"" - this is a semantic error where the model simplified the active creation of opportunities. The German ""zahlreiche Torchancen"" should be ""the most occasions"" not ""numerous chances to score"" - this is a semantic error where the model missed the emphasis on having the most chances.

Wenn Justin Bieber einen Kaffee trinkt, staunt man an der Fensterscheibe.	"Initial translation: If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, people stop and stare at the window.

Analysis: The German ""staunt man an der Fensterscheibe"" should be ""people goggle through the window"" not ""stop and stare at the window"" - the reference captures the idea of looking through glass to observe someone, while the model suggests staring at the window itself. The verb ""staunen"" means to be amazed/goggle rather than simply stare. The preposition ""an"" in this context means people are positioned at the window looking through it, not looking at it as an object. The model misunderstood the spatial relationship and the nature of the observation

Corrected translation: When Justin Bieber drinks coffee people goggle through the window."	error_correction

"Initial translation: What was not mentioned was the total amount still owed to her and the number of cheques that are still being issued in her favour.

Analysis: The German ""Was nicht erwähnt wurde"" should be ""What wasn't reported"" not ""What was not mentioned"" - ""erwähnt"" in this context is about reporting, not just mentioning. The phrase ""die man ihr noch schuldet"" means ""that still has to be paid"" not ""still owed to her"" - it's about general payment obligation, not specifically to her. The word ""infolgedessen"" means ""therefore"" which was omitted, breaking the logical connection. The model also added ""that are still being issued in her favour"" which doesn't match the target about checks to be written

"Initial translation: Already 15 years ago, there were first thoughts about solving the problem, when it was planned to build a third place on the football club's ground or at the Realschule at Salinensee.

Analysis: The German ""Platz"" in this context means ""pitch/field"" (sports field) but was translated as ""place"" which is too generic - the reference correctly uses ""third pitch"" showing this is about sports facilities. The phrase ""Realschule am Salinensee"" should be ""secondary school on Salinensee Lake"" as the reference shows, but the model kept ""Realschule"" untranslated and used ""at Salinensee"" rather than explaining the lake connection. The model also used ""it was planned"" while the reference uses ""were considered"" which better captures the preliminary nature of the thoughts

Corrected translation: It was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first considered, when the construction of a third pitch on the football club site or at the secondary school on Salinensee Lake were considered."	error_correction
Aber - vorrangig sollen diese denjenigen Leute zugute kommen, die die Vereinbarungen über die Mieterhöhung unterschreiben.	"Initial translation: However, - first and foremost, these are to benefit those people who sign the agreements on rent increases.

Analysis: The German ""Aber - vorrangig sollen diese denjenigen Leute zugute kommen"" should be ""Priority will be given to people"" not ""However, - first and foremost, these are to benefit those people"" - the target is more concise and direct. The phrase ""die die Vereinbarungen über die Mieterhöhung unterschreiben"" should be ""who sign the agreement to increase rents"" not ""who sign the agreements on rent increases"" - subtle difference in preposition and singular/plural.

So wurde das Fest der unbeständigen Witterung ausgesetzt, weshalb zwei von drei Feiern nicht stattfinden konnten.	"Initial translation: The Festival of Unstable Weather was exposed to the elements, so two out of three events could not take place.

Analysis: The German ""das Fest der unbeständigen Witterung ausgesetzt"" doesn't mean there was a ""Festival of Unstable Weather"" - this appears to be a misunderstanding where the model created a festival name from the weather description. The phrase means ""the festival was exposed to unstable weather"" but the model treated ""unbeständigen Witterung"" as part of the festival's name. The reference correctly interprets this as ""The weather was rather fierce against this Festival"" showing weather as the external force, not part of the festival's identity. This is a significant semantic misunderstanding that changes the entire scenario

Corrected translation: The weather was rather fierce against this Festival and prevented two over three celebrations."	error_correction

Angst vor einem Gottesstaat am Nil von Gnaden der mächtigen Muslimbruderschaft.	"Initial translation: Fear of a theocratic Egypt, at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.

Analysis: The German ""Gottesstaat am Nil"" means ""God State on the Nile"" not ""theocratic Egypt"" - while similar in meaning, the poetic reference to ""the Nile"" should be preserved. The phrase ""von Gnaden"" means ""at the mercy of"" which was correctly translated. The model also omitted ""They are fearful of"" which provides the subject and makes the sentence more complete.

"Initial translation: The perpetrators must have fled after the attack towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and must have fled from the gravel car park opposite the entrance to Parkhaus to the B 256 (Schladernring).

Analysis: The model omitted ""gerannt"" (run) which describes how they moved towards Gerberstraße - this detail about running is present in the reference ""must have run towards"". The phrase ""multi-storey car park"" was shortened to just ""Parkhaus"" without translation, making it less accessible to English readers. The word ""Schotterparkplatz"" was correctly translated as ""gravel car park"". The sentence structure is somewhat repetitive with ""fled"" used twice, while the reference varies this better. However, the model captured most of the complex directional information

Corrected translation: After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße along Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and then fled, possibly towards the B 256 (Schladern ring road) in the silver car from the Schotterparkplatz opposite the entrance to the multi-storey car park."	error_correction

The phrase ""ebenso einer Beteiligung abgeneigt"" should be ""looking just as reluctant to be drawn in"" not ""not interested in participating"" - this suggests similar reluctance to previous mentioned parties.

Es war fast, als hätte mir jemand den Kopf endlich richtig aufgesetzt.	"Initial translation: It was almost as if someone had finally put my head straight.

Analysis: The German ""endlich richtig aufgesetzt"" should be ""had my head put on straight for me"" not ""put my head straight"" - the target uses the specific idiomatic expression ""put on straight for me"" which includes the assistance aspect. The phrase ""mir...aufgesetzt"" should be ""for me"" not omitted - this emphasizes that someone else did this action for the speaker. The model's version is close but misses the exact idiomatic phrasing and the ""for me"" element that indicates external help

Corrected translation: It's almost like I had my head put on straight for me."	error_correction
Zum diesjährigen ersten Jahrgang dieser speziellen Unterkategorie des Hauptwettbewerbs Vodafon Firma des Jahres meldeten sich Firmen an, für die der Erfolg nicht das einzige langfristige Ziel ist.	"Initial translation: This year's first year of this special category of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition has seen companies entering which are not only successful but also have a long-term vision.

Analysis: The German ""diesjährigen ersten Jahrgang"" should be ""first year of this special subcategory"" not ""This year's first year"" - this is awkward phrasing showing a fluency error. The phrase ""meldeten sich Firmen an"" should be ""companies signed for the competition"" not ""has seen companies entering"" - this is a semantic error in the verb choice. The German ""für die der Erfolg nicht das einzige langfristige Ziel ist"" should be ""for whom success in business is not the only long-term goal"" not ""which are not only successful but also have a long-term vision"" - the model completely changed the meaning from companies where success isn't the only goal to companies that are successful AND have vision

Corrected translation: In the first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafone competition Company of the year 2010, companies, for whom success in business is not the only long-term goal, signed for the competition."	error_correction

Diese Botschaft hat das Floß am Samstag auf der Isar	"Initial translation: This message was delivered on Saturday on the Isar

Analysis: The German source ""Diese Botschaft hat das Floß am Samstag auf der Isar"" is incomplete - it appears to cut off mid-sentence, but the model completed it as if it were a full sentence. This is an incomplete translation where the model should have indicated the sentence was unfinished. The phrase ""hat das Floß"" should be ""the raft had"" not ""was delivered"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the subject-verb relationship. The German indicates the raft had the message, not that the message was delivered

Corrected translation: The raft on the Isar had this message on Saturday"	error_correction
Portugal dominierte über mehr als eine Stunde klar die Partie, aber die Mannschaft war nicht imstande, der Sache den so wichtigen Stempel aufzudrücken, der den Druck von ihr genommen hätte.	"Initial translation: Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the final touches to the job, which was so important.

Analysis: The German ""der Sache den so wichtigen Stempel aufzudrücken"" means ""to reach this precious target"" (metaphorically putting a decisive stamp on the situation) but was translated as ""put the final touches to the job"" which sounds like manual work rather than achieving a crucial goal in football. The phrase ""der den Druck von ihr genommen hätte"" should be ""which would have consoled it"" not omitted - this explains the psychological relief the goal would have provided. The translation loses the emotional and strategic football context present in the original

Corrected translation: Whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour, it was not able to reach this precious target, which would have consoled it."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""Schöne Münchnerin"" (Beautiful Munich Woman/Beauty of Munich) was completely reduced to just ""Munich"" - this omits the key concept that this is about a beauty pageant or competition, not just the city. The model stripped away the entire meaning of ""Schöne"" (beautiful/beauty) and ""Münchnerin"" (Munich woman), losing the context that this appears to be about a beauty contest or similar event. The capitalization of ""Nine"" was also lost to ""nine""

"""Wir können auf ihn leider nicht zurückgreifen"", sagte Thomas Tuchel am Mittwoch."	"Initial translation: Unfortunately, we cannot go back to him, said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.

Analysis: The German phrase ""auf ihn zurückgreifen"" means ""isn't in the running"" or ""can't count on him"" (in sports context about player availability) not ""go back to him"" which suggests returning to someone. The phrase is about current availability/eligibility, not about returning to a previous relationship. In sports contexts, this typically means a player is unavailable due to injury or other reasons

Corrected translation: ""Unfortunately he isn't in the running,"" said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday."	error_correction
Das sei eben nicht so, denn mit dem Erwerb der Fläche gebe man keinen Zuschuss, sondern bekomme einen echten, im Zweifelsfall vermarktbaren Gegenwert, lautet die Gegenrede.	"Initial translation: That is not the case, because when you buy the land you do not get a subsidy, but you get a real, marketable asset, according to the other side.

Analysis: The model translated ""gebe man keinen Zuschuss"" as ""you do not get a subsidy"" when it should be ""they are not giving away any grants"" - completely reversing the direction of the financial transaction. The phrase ""bekomme einen echten, im Zweifelsfall vermarktbaren Gegenwert"" was simplified to ""you get a real, marketable asset"" but should be ""are rather getting a genuine, when in doubt saleable, equivalent in value"" - losing the conditional ""when in doubt"" and the specific term ""equivalent in value

Corrected translation: That is simply not true according to the counterargument, for by purchasing the plot they are not giving away any grants, but are rather getting a genuine, when in doubt saleable, equivalent in value."	error_correction
Je höher der Kirchturm, so scheint es, desto geringer die Leidenschaft, die er weiterhin weckt.	"Initial translation: The higher the steeple, it seems, the less the passion it arouses.

Analysis: The German ""Kirchturm"" should be ""spire"" not ""steeple"" - these are different architectural elements. The phrase ""die Leidenschaft, die er weiterhin weckt"" should be ""the passions it goes on engendering"" not ""the passion it arouses"" - ""engendering"" is more formal and ""goes on"" emphasizes continuation. The structure ""desto geringer"" should be ""the lower"" not ""the less"" to match the target's specific phrasing. The model simplified the formal language and used less precise architectural terminology

Corrected translation: The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it goes on engendering."	error_correction

"Initial translation: The Deka Bank, with its 3000 employees, is not the first to talk about consolidation in the savings bank sector.

Analysis: The German sentence structure is completely changed - the model makes Deka Bank the subject who talks about consolidation, but the target means ""it's not the first time that the name Deka Bank crops up"" in discussions. The phrase ""ist...die Rede"" means ""the name crops up"" not ""is...to talk about"" - passive vs active construction. The phrase ""die zu den wichtigeren Arbeitgebern am Finanzplatz Frankfurt zählt"" (one of the more significant employers in the financial center of Frankfurt) is mostly omitted from the prediction. The phrase ""wenn es um Konsolidierung...geht"" should be ""in the context of...consolidation"" not just about talking

Analysis: The translation is incomplete - it omits the crucial subject ""NATO"" entirely.

The phrase ""nicht kalt lassen"" should be ""not be able to be indifferent"" not ""sit idly by"" - while similar in meaning, the target uses specific phrasing. The translation becomes meaningless without identifying who ""it"" refers to

Corrected translation: If that is true, Nato would not be able to be indifferent to such a development."	error_correction

Um das Alter der Tiere zu ermitteln, analysierten sie mit der Kohlenstoff-14-Methode den Linsenkern der Haie.	"Initial translation: To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the carbon-14 content of the hake's livers.

Analysis: The German ""Linsenkern der Haie"" means ""lens core of the sharks"" but was completely mistranslated as ""hake's livers"" - this changes both the animal type (sharks vs hake fish) and the body part being analyzed (eye lens vs liver). The phrase ""mit der Kohlenstoff-14-Methode"" was correctly understood as carbon-14 analysis but the model changed it to ""carbon-14 content"" rather than ""carbon-14 dating"" which is more precise. This is a critical scientific error that completely changes the research methodology from examining shark eye lenses to fish livers

Corrected translation: They use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age."	error_correction
Laut Piffl soll der neue Vorsitzende dann in das Gespräch mit dem Burgverein gehen.	"Initial translation: According to Piffl, the new President will then have to talk to the Burgverein.

Analysis: The German ""Vorsitzende"" means ""chairperson"" not ""President"" - these are different leadership roles. The word ""Burgverein"" should be translated as ""castle club"" not left in German, as it's a compound noun that can be understood in English. The phrase ""in das Gespräch... gehen"" means ""enter into discussions"" not just ""talk to"" - it implies more formal dialogue

"Große Erwartungen setzt der Asylkoordinator auch in die ORF-Aktion ""Helfen wie wir""."	"Initial translation: The Asylum Coordinator also has high expectations of the ORF action 'Helfen wie wir'.

The phrase ""Große Erwartungen setzt"" should be ""has also got high expectations"" not ""also has high expectations"" - the reference uses more emphatic language. The word ""Aktion"" should be ""campaign"" not ""action"" for more specific terminology

Corrected translation: The asylum coordinator has also got high expectations of the ORF ""Help the way we are"" campaign."	error_correction
Ich werde, meinem Kind große Glücksgefühle vermitteln und es mit viel Liebe erziehen.	"Initial translation: I will, my child, give you a lot of happiness and love.

Analysis: The German ""meinem Kind große Glücksgefühle vermitteln"" should be ""give my son a lot of happiness"" not ""give you a lot of happiness"" - the model incorrectly switched to second person. The phrase ""mit viel Liebe erziehen"" should be ""educate him with bigger love"" not just ""love"" - the word ""bigger"" is specifically mentioned in the target. The grammatical structure places an unnecessary comma after ""will"" and changes the person reference incorrectly. The word ""Kind"" should be ""son"" not ""child"" according to the target specification

Corrected translation: I will give my son a lot of happiness and I will educate him with bigger love."	error_correction
Diejenigen, die Musik diese Grenze überschreiten, riskieren den kompletten Verlust des Gehörs binnen von fünf Jahren.	"Initial translation: Those who cross this line risk losing their hearing completely within five years.

Analysis: The German ""Diejenigen, die Musik diese Grenze überschreiten"" should be ""People who listen to music under such conditions for longer durations"" not ""Those who cross this line"" - the model omitted crucial context about music listening and duration. The phrase ""riskieren den kompletten Verlust des Gehörs binnen von fünf Jahren"" should be ""risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period"" not ""risk losing their hearing completely within five years"" - the target emphasizes ""permanent"" and ""hearing ability"" with ""after"" rather than ""within

"Der Verschlüsseler notiert also und liest laut vor: ""Werfen"" für die Würfel, ""Lose"" als Gegensatz zu Fest; hier wäre natürlich auch so etwas wie ""Party"" möglich und ""Prag"" weil er in der Schule aufgepasst hat und den dortigen Fenstersturz kennt."	"Initial translation: The decoder then notes and reads out: 'Throw' for dice, 'lose' as opposed to fixed; 'party' because he has been to Prague and knows about the window-falling.

Analysis: The German ""Verschlüsseler"" should be ""encryptor"" not ""decoder"" - these are opposite roles in cryptography. The phrase ""als Gegensatz zu Fest"" should be ""as opposed to 'solid'"" not ""as opposed to fixed"" - this is about physical properties. The reference suggests ""evidence"" as an alternative to ""Party"" but the model chose ""party"" without the proper context. The phrase ""Fenstersturz"" should be ""defenestration of Prague"" not ""window-falling"" - this is a specific historical term. The model also incorrectly suggests personal experience (""he has been to Prague"") rather than academic knowledge (""he read some history books"")

Analysis: The German ""dritte Aspekt"" should be ""gloom aspect"" not ""third aspect"" - this appears to be about the gloomy/depressing nature, not numerical ordering. The phrase ""um ein, zwei und bis zu drei Mal nachzudenken"" should be ""to push people to think not just once but twice or even three times"" not ""to think, think again and think again"" - the target emphasizes the pushing action and graduation. The phrase ""nach keinem Kredit zu fragen"" should be ""before applying for a loan"" not ""whether it is the right time to ask for no credit"" - this is about loan applications, not avoiding credit

Er steigt auf einen Lautsprecher und legt sich die Schlinge um den Hals.	"Initial translation: He gets up on the speaker's platform and hangs himself.

Analysis: The German ""steigt auf einen Lautsprecher"" should be ""climbs on a speaker"" not ""gets up on the speaker's platform"" - this is about climbing on the audio equipment, not a speaking platform. The phrase ""legt sich die Schlinge um den Hals"" should be ""puts the noose around his neck"" not ""hangs himself"" - the model jumped to the conclusion rather than describing the action of placing the noose. The sequence is about preparation (putting on noose) not completion (hanging). The model added interpretation beyond what the German describes

Analysis: The German ""berichtete Tedesco von dem Moment, als er Naldo gesagt hatte, dass er nicht in der Startelf stehe"" was almost completely omitted. The model only preserved ""It was not easy to tell him that"" but lost the attribution to Tedesco, the reference to Naldo, and the crucial information about not being in the starting lineup.

Das ist eine Randbefestigung, die auch als Betriebsweg benutzt wird.	"Initial translation: This is a side fence that is also used as a road.

Analysis: The German ""Randbefestigung"" was translated as ""side fence"" when it should be ""boundary fixing/boundary reinforcement"" - this is a specialized construction/surveying term that the model interpreted too literally. The phrase ""als Betriebsweg benutzt wird"" should be ""used as a passenger path"" not ""used as a road"" - ""Betriebsweg"" in this context refers to a service/operational path for pedestrians, not a vehicular road.

The phrase ""wie das Finanzministerium jeweils aushilft"" should be ""the nature of the support provided by the Treasury"" not ""how the Finance Ministry helps"" - this is about the type/nature of support, not the manner of helping. The word ""Finanzministerium"" should be ""Treasury"" not ""Finance Ministry"" to match the target terminology. The semantic focus shifts from payment restrictions to salary reductions, changing the meaning

Corrected translation: The restriction of payments is introduced in certain cases only, limitations depend on the nature of the support provided by the Treasury."	error_correction

Ihre Absicht ist es, für Puigcercós zu bürgen. Im Gegenzug soll dieser versprechen, den Kongress in den Herbst 2011 vorzuverlegen, was die Parteispitze bereits für einen Fakt hält.	"Initial translation: Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós, in exchange for which he is to promise to postpone the Congress to the autumn of 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.

Analysis: The German ""vorzuverlegen"" means ""to bring forward/advance"" but was translated as ""postpone"" - this is the opposite meaning, changing from moving the congress earlier to moving it later. The phrase ""für...zu bürgen"" means ""to speak for/vouch for"" but was translated as ""guarantee"" which is less precise about advocacy vs financial guarantee. The word ""Parteispitze"" (party leadership) was correctly translated while the reference uses ""cupola"" (a more architectural metaphor). The timing error fundamentally changes the political strategy being described

Corrected translation: Its intention is to speak for Puigcercós in exchange for promising to advance the congress to the autumn of 2011, something that the cupola considers already done."	error_correction
Auch auf der Kurzstrecke verteilt Swiss Schoggi von Chocolat Frey, sowohl in der Business als auch in der Economy Class.	"Initial translation: Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey is also distributed on short-haul flights, both in Business and Economy Class.

Analysis: The German ""verteilt Swiss Schoggi"" means ""Swiss distributes chocolate"" where Swiss is the airline, not ""Swiss Schoggi is distributed"" - the model makes the product the subject instead of the company. The phrase ""Schoggi von Chocolat Frey"" should be ""chocolate from Chocolate Frey"" not ""Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey"" - the target treats ""Schoggi"" as the generic word for chocolate. The phrase ""auf der Kurzstrecke"" should be ""On short-haul routes"" not ""on short-haul flights"" - routes vs flights. The grammatical structure should emphasize Swiss (the airline) as the active agent: ""Swiss hands out

Corrected translation: On short-haul routes too, Swiss hands out chocolate from Chocolate Frey, both in business and in economy class."	error_correction

Die Kinder kreuzten im Fragebogen auch viel öfter Geflügel oder Fisch als Hauptgericht des Tages an und waren bereit, weniger Knödel oder süße Speisen zu essen.	"Initial translation: Children in the questionnaire were also more likely to have had poultry or fish as the main course of the day and were willing to eat fewer potatoes or sweet foods.

Analysis: The German ""kreuzten...an"" should be ""ticked"" not ""were more likely to have had"" - wrong tense and meaning. The word ""Knödel"" should be ""dumplings"" not ""potatoes"" - these are completely different foods. The phrase ""waren bereit, weniger...zu essen"" should be ""limiting"" not ""were willing to eat fewer"" - the meaning implies they actually did limit, not just willingness. The structure should emphasize the positive choices (poultry/fish) and then mention the limitation aspect

Corrected translation: In addition, for their main course, children ticked poultry and fish more often, limiting sweet meals and dumplings."	error_correction

Besonders kompliziert macht es immer das drohende Damoklesschwert Sonderbau und die Stellplatzverordnung.	"Initial translation: The most complicated thing is always the threat of special construction and the parking regulations.

Analysis: The German ""Besonders kompliziert macht es immer das drohende Damoklesschwert Sonderbau"" should be ""The sword of Damocles threatening special building projects...always make it complicated"" not ""The most complicated thing is always the threat of special construction"" - wrong grammatical structure and missing the classical metaphor emphasis. The phrase ""Damoklesschwert"" should be translated as ""sword of Damocles"" to maintain the classical reference. The word ""Stellplatzverordnung"" should be ""parking space regulations"" not just ""parking regulations"" - more specific terminology. The model reversed the emphasis from multiple things making it complicated to one most complicated thing

Corrected translation: The sword of Damocles threatening special building projects, and parking space regulations, always make it complicated."	error_correction

Vor allem: Wo soll die Bauernmarkthalle während der Bauzeit hin?	"Initial translation: Above all, where is the farmers' market going to be during the construction period?

Analysis: The phrase ""Vor allem"" was translated as ""Above all"" when ""In particular"" is more appropriate for this questioning context.  The construction ""soll. . . hin"" asking about location was simplified, losing some of the directional nuance.  The model understood the basic question but missed architectural and contextual precision

Corrected translation: In particular: Where should the covered market go while construction is ongoing?"	error_correction
"Einen mächtigen Stamm zeigten wir bei unserer Rätselaufgabe der Sommerserie ""Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück"" am vergangenen Freitag."	"Initial translation: We had a powerful tribe last Friday in our summer series 'My piece of Rhine luck' quiz.

Analysis: The German ""mächtigen Stamm"" should be ""mighty tree trunk"" not ""powerful tribe"" - this is about showing a tree trunk, not having a group of people. The place name ""Rhöner"" should be ""Rhön"" not ""Rhine"" - these are different German regions. The word ""Glück"" should be ""happiness"" not ""luck"" in this context. The phrase ""zeigten wir"" should be ""we showed"" not ""we had"" which changes the action. The model completely misunderstood both the object (tree vs people) and the location

Im Januar 2010 wurde sie unehrenhaft entlassen, so dass sie keinerlei Unterstützung erhält.	"Initial translation: She was sacked in January 2010 without any support.

Analysis: The German ""unehrenhaft entlassen"" should be translated as ""discharged under less-than-honorable terms"" not simply ""sacked"", as this refers to military/official discharge conditions rather than general employment termination. The phrase ""so dass sie keinerlei Unterstützung erhält"" was simplified to ""without any support"" but should be ""preventing her from receiving any benefits"" to show the causal relationship and specify ""benefits"" rather than general ""support"".

Analysis: The German ""preschte durch"" should be ""burst through"" not restructured as ""scored a try after"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the action sequence. The phrase ""weitere schwache Tacklings"" should be ""some more limp GB tackling"" not ""another weak tackle"" - this is a lexical error where the model simplified the plural and missed the emphasis of ""limp"". The German ""stürmte bis zur Linie, um ein Tor zu machen"" should be ""stormed to the line to score"" not ""stormed over the line"" - the model missed the ""bis zur"" (to the) distinction

Insbesondere in den höheren Lagen ist daher erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit geboten.	"Initial translation: In particular, therefore, attention is needed in the higher areas.

Analysis: The German ""erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit geboten"" should be ""extra care should be taken while driving"" not just ""attention is needed"" - this omits the crucial ""while driving"" context that specifies the type of care needed. The phrase ""höheren Lagen"" should be ""higher levels"" not ""higher areas"" - levels is more specific to altitude/elevation context. The word ""geboten"" implies ""should be taken"" (an obligation) not just ""is needed"" (a requirement).

Analysis: The German ""würden sie ganz von allein bei Freunden und Bekannten für ihren Arbeitgeber werben"" should be ""they will find you new employees among their friends and acquaintances"" not ""they will be your best advertisement"" - the model missed that this is specifically about recruiting/finding new employees, not general advertising.

The phrase ""im Vorteil"" was translated as ""in a better position"" but should be ""surely holds more cards in his deck"" which is a more vivid metaphorical expression.

Seiner Meinung nach greifen die Krankenkassen jedoch nicht nach Regressverfahren, um die zur Heilung der trunkenen Kinder notwendigen Kosten von den Eltern einfordern.	"Initial translation: He thinks that the sick funds do not resort to recovery procedures to recover the costs of treating drunk children.

Analysis: The German sentence structure suggests insurance companies as the subject, but the model adds ""He thinks that"" which changes the perspective. The phrase ""Krankenkassen"" should be ""Insurance companies"" not ""sick funds"" - more formal terminology. The phrase ""greifen...nicht nach Regressverfahren"" should be ""do not take regression procedures"" not ""do not resort to recovery procedures"" - the target uses specific legal terminology. The complex meaning about parents covering costs is simplified in the prediction

Vargas Llosa, der Premium des Festivals Hay Festival gewonnen hat und dem die meisten Anwesenden ihre Stimme gabe, wird mit der alten Ausgabe von `Our mutual friend' verglichen und ist im Theater Juan Bravo zu sehen.	"Initial translation: Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival's Hay Prize and who was the most popular author with the audience, is compared with the old version of `Our mutual friend' and is to be seen at the Teatro Juan Bravo.

Analysis: The German text describes a complex situation where ""Premium des Festivals Hay Festival"" should be ""Hay Festival prize"" and the comparison with ""Our mutual friend"" by Dickens is about an ancient edition being part of the prize, not comparing Vargas Llosa to the book. The phrase ""packed the theatre Juan Bravo with fans"" was completely lost and replaced with a simple ""is to be seen at"" which misses the impact and audience enthusiasm. The model misunderstood the relationship between the author, the prize (which included a Dickens book), and the packed theater

"Rolf Ihmig kürte die Allee in seinem schlagerartigen Lied zur ""Kö von Hiltrup""."	"Initial translation: Rolf Ihmig has written a song about the 'Kö of Hiltrup' which is a bit like a hit.

Analysis: The German ""kürte...zur"" means ""crowned/declared as"" but was misunderstood as simply ""written a song about"" - this loses the sense of designation or proclamation. The word ""Allee"" (avenue) was completely omitted from the translation, and there's no mention of ""Marktalle"" which appears in the reference. The phrase ""schlagerartigen Lied"" (hit-like/folk-like song) was simplified to ""a bit like a hit"" rather than the more specific ""folk-like song"".

The phrase ""nicht einmal selbstverständlich"" should emphasize that ""obvious things"" are not commonplace, but the model focused on prohibition rather than lack of courtesy.

Analysis: The German ""Wimpernschlagfinale"" should be translated as ""the leading riders were neck and neck"" not ""the final sprint was a photo finish"" - the model lost the specific cycling context about riders being close.

Analysis: The German ""Lebensfreude"" should be ""zest for like"" not ""joy of life"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a more common expression but the reference has a typo (""like"" should be ""life""). The phrase ""strahle bereits Herr Li aus"" should be ""already beams out of Mr Li"" not ""is already shining through Mr Li"" - this is a semantic error where the model changed the direction of the beaming.

Im Tarifkonflikt mit der Pilotenvereinigung Cockpit (VC) sollen die Verhandlungen nach dem gerichtlich gestoppten Streik an diesem Donnerstag wieder aufgenommen werden.	"Initial translation: Talks are to resume today in the tariff dispute with the pilots' union, Cockpit.

Analysis: The German ""nach dem gerichtlich gestoppten Streik"" meaning ""Following the strike which was halted on legal grounds"" was completely omitted from the translation. The phrase ""an diesem Donnerstag"" should be ""on Thursday"" not ""today"" - this is a temporal reference error. The word ""Tarifkonflikt"" should be ""pay dispute"" not ""tariff dispute"" - this is about salary negotiations, not trade tariffs.

Réal Laporte, der große Arbeitgeber der Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), hat eine Erklärung abgegeben, die die Nase über das Faktum hat rümpfen lassen, dass der Vertrag über die Projektleitung nach Übereinkunft bewilligt wurde.	"Initial translation: Réal Laporte, the big employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made a lot of people's noses wrinkle, because the agreement on the project management contract has been approved.

Analysis: The German ""der große Arbeitgeber"" should be ""The head of the Eastmain project"" not ""the big employer"" - the reference provides specific contextual information about his role. The idiomatic phrase ""die Nase...rümpfen lassen"" should be ""raised eyebrows"" not ""made people's noses wrinkle"" - while literally similar, ""raised eyebrows"" is the proper English idiom for expressing skepticism. The phrase ""nach Übereinkunft bewilligt"" should be ""awarded by mutual agreement"" not ""approved because the agreement"" - this is about contract awarding methodology, not approval reasoning. The model lost the specific project context and used awkward literal translations of idioms

The phrase ""schätzte Jandura"" should be ""estimates Jandura"" not ""said Jandura"" - ""schätzen"" means to estimate or assess, not just to say.

The phrase ""drei Zelte des Roten Kreuzes daneben"" should be ""three tents"" (with the Red Cross being the one erecting them) not ""three tents next to the Red Cross tents"" - the model misunderstood the relationship and suggests there were already existing Red Cross tents. The word ""Innenbehörde"" should be ""German Internal Affairs Authority"" not just ""Interior Ministry"" - the reference provides more specific institutional context.

Analysis: The phrase ""spielerisch und kämpferisch starke Vorstellung"" should be ""strong performance, both in terms of play and spirit"" not ""the game and the fight"" - the model oversimplified and changed the meaning from a performance evaluation to basic activities. The phrase ""abgelöste Trainerteam"" should be ""replaced team of coaches"" not ""previous coaching team"" - ""abgelöst"" specifically means replaced/dismissed, not just previous.

The word ""Vorschlag"" in this context should be understood as the photographer's approach/aim, not a literal proposal. The phrase ""eine besondere Ikonografie"" should be ""an original iconography"" not ""a special iconography"" - different emphasis. The German ""auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen"" should be ""taken from different perspectives"" not ""at different levels"" - wrong interpretation of ""Ebenen"" in photography context.

Das wiederholte sich vor drei Jahren bei den Bundestagswahlen 2005, also noch in der viel zitierten Stoiber-Ära.	"Initial translation: This happened three years ago, in the much-quoted Stoiber era.

Analysis: The model completely omitted ""bei den Bundestagswahlen 2005"" (during the Bundestag election 2005) - this is crucial contextual information about when the event occurred. The phrase ""Das wiederholte sich"" should be ""It happened again"" not just ""This happened"" - losing the repetition aspect that's central to the meaning. The model maintained ""much-quoted"" for ""viel zitierten"" but lost the temporal specificity and political context. The omission of the election reference significantly changes the meaning and context

The phrase ""eierlegende Wollmilchsau"" should be ""jack-of-all-trades"" not ""egg-laying woolly mammoth"" - this is a lexical error where the model was too literal with a German idiom.

Analysis: The grammatical structure creates a run-on sentence listing slogans as the subject, when it should maintain the direct speech format with proper punctuation. The German ""ermächtigten Partisanen"" should be ""pro-government supporters"" not ""armed partisans"" - ""ermächtigt"" means empowered/authorized by government, not armed.

"Dort war 1858/59 die Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt ""Auf der Auer Lüften"" entstanden."	"Initial translation: There, in 1858/59, the Munich Circle Asylum, 'Auf der Auer Lüften', was created.

Analysis: The German ""Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt"" should be ""Munich district mental asylum"" not ""Munich Circle Asylum"" - ""Kreis"" in this context means district, not circle. The phrase ""war entstanden"" should be ""had come to life"" not ""was created"" - the reference translation uses more vivid language suggesting organic development rather than simple creation. The reference suggests a more naturalistic emergence of the institution

Corrected translation: The Munich district mental asylum ""Auf der Auer Lüften"" had come to life there in 1858/59."	error_correction

"Im Jahr 1937 tauchte in der Fachpresse der von Ing. Rohoziński stammende Entwurf einer fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete auf, und im darauf folgenden Jahr erschien das Werk ""Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza"" des Autors Leliwa-Krzywoblocky."

Rohoziński appeared in the technical press, and in 1938, the work 'Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza' by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.

Analysis: The German ""fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete"" should be ""photoelectric homing rocket"" not just ""photoelectric rocket"" - missing the crucial ""homing"" capability. The phrase ""im darauf folgenden Jahr"" should be ""in the following year"" not ""in 1938"" - the model unnecessarily specified the year. The author name ""Leliwy-Krywoblocki"" was spelled incorrectly as ""Leliwa-Krzywoblocky"" - wrong spelling of the surname. The word ""Fachpresse"" should be ""trade press"" not ""technical press"" - different industry terminology

Tüten haben auch schon Verkehrseinrichtungen wie Leitplanken verdeckt und dadurch Unfälle ausgelöst.	"Initial translation: Bins have already hidden traffic signs and caused accidents.

Analysis: The German ""Tüten"" should be ""Bags"" not ""Bins"" - these are plastic bags, not garbage containers. The phrase ""Verkehrseinrichtungen wie Leitplanken"" should be ""transport facilities such as crash barriers"" not ""traffic signs"" - the model omitted the crash barriers example and generalized incorrectly. The word ""verdeckt"" should be ""covering"" not ""hidden"" - this is about physical covering, not concealment. The phrase ""have also been seen covering"" was simplified to just ""have...hidden

Corrected translation: Bags have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barriers, thus causing accidents."	error_correction
"Offensiv ""plätscherte alles so ein bisschen"" gegen ein Team, ""das nur verteidigen wollte."	"Initial translation: It was a bit of an offensive 'platitude' against a team that just wanted to defend.

Analysis: The German ""plätscherte alles so ein bisschen"" means ""everything just happened somehow"" or ""everything just trickled along"" - it's about lack of intensity, not a ""platitude"". The word ""plätscherte"" means to trickle or flow gently, indicating weak offensive play. The model misunderstood this as the English word ""platitude"" which is completely different. The phrase should indicate that the offense was lackluster and unfocused

Analysis: The German ""mit Hilfe des ehemaligen Regierungspräsidenten Felipe González"" (with the support of ex-president Felipe González) is completely omitted from the prediction. The phrase ""stellvertretende Regierungschefin"" should be ""Vice-president"" not ""Deputy Prime Minister"" - different title. The phrase ""unterstützt...die Kritik an der Kanzlerin...als Verantwortliche"" should be ""has added to the critics to the councillor...her responsibility"" not ""is supporting the criticism of the Chancellor...for being responsible"" - the target has more complex structure about adding to critics and responsibility. The phrase ""die die derzeitige Krise herausbeschwört habe"" should be ""in untying the present crisis"" not ""for being responsible for the current crisis"" - different metaphor

Besonders interessant in Zeiten in denen in Nagold die Geburtsklinik wegrationalisiert werden soll.	"Initial translation: Very interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalised.

Analysis: The German ""wegrationalisiert"" should be translated as ""do away with"" not ""rationalised"" - ""wegrationalisiert"" specifically means to eliminate through rationalization, not to make more rational. The phrase ""Besonders interessant"" should be ""This is particularly interesting"" not ""Very interesting"" to include the demonstrative reference. The model used ""birth clinic"" instead of ""maternity clinic"" which is the more standard medical terminology

Das zweite Zeichen setzte das mitteleuropäische Land, als Merkel die Entscheidung zur Rettung Griechenlands schmerzhaft hinausschob.	"Initial translation: The second sign was given by the Central European country when Merkel postponed the decision on Greece's rescue.

Analysis: The model missed that ""Zeichen"" here means ""headache"" (problem/signal) not just ""sign,"" and it's a headache FOR the Central European country, not given BY it. The phrase ""schmerzhaft hinausschob"" means ""laboriously extended"" not just ""postponed"" - it emphasizes the painful/difficult nature of the delay. The model also simplified ""zur Rettung Griechenlands"" to ""on Greece's rescue"" when ""of rescuing Greece"" is more precise. The causal relationship and the country's perspective were lost

The phrase ""Wie vielseitig...sind"" should be ""how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are"" not ""The diversity of tasks...was demonstrated"" - the sentence structure should emphasize the demonstration of versatility.

The second part ""will Deutschland überhaupt eine Hauptrolle übernehmen"" should be ""does Germany actually want to assume a leading role"" not ""does Germany want to play a major international role"" - ""übernehmen"" means assume, and ""Hauptrolle"" is leading role.

The phrase ""vierten Weltcupplatz"" should be ""fourth place world cup finish"" not ""fourth World Cup podium"" - ""Platz"" means position/place, not podium (which implies top 3).

Analysis: The name ""El Juli"" should remain as ""El Juli"" not translated to ""July"" - this is a proper name (likely a bullfighter's stage name), not the month. The phrase ""Arena de Los Llanos"" should be ""bull-ring of Los Llanos"" not ""Arena de Los Llanos"" - using the English term for the venue type. The phrase ""ohne Schwierigkeit, aber auch ohne Ruhm"" should be ""gaining no glory, no penalty"" not ""without difficulty, but without glory"" - the reference emphasizes the neutral result with ""gaining no glory, no penalty"" rather than just describing absence of difficulty and glory. The phrase ""Und noch schlechter"" should be ""Among all, the worst"" not ""And even worse"" - this provides comparative context among multiple performers

Corrected translation: Among all, the worst was El Juli, who passed by the bull-ring of Los Llanos gaining no glory, no penalty."	error_correction
"""Nennen wir es lieber eine Weggehparty, ganz locker, mit ein paar Freunden, ein paar Drinks, ein paar Spielen."""	"Initial translation: Let us call it a stroll, a walk, a party, a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.

Analysis: The German ""Weggehparty"" should be ""going away party"" not ""stroll, a walk, a party"" - this is a single compound concept, not multiple activities. The phrase ""ganz locker"" (really relaxed) was completely omitted. The structure should maintain the party context ""with a few friends, a couple of drinks and the odd game"" not fragment into separate items. The model broke down the compound word incorrectly and lost the coherent meaning

Corrected translation: ""Lets just call it a going away party, really relaxed with a few friends, a couple of drinks and the odd game."""	error_correction

"Initial translation: As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay USD 20 million, and Musk gives up the Chairman's position for three years, which is comparable to the German supervisory board.

Analysis: The German ""Vergleichs"" should be ""settlement"" not ""comparison"" - this is a legal settlement, not a comparison study. The phrase ""außerdem gibt Musk für drei Jahre das Amt des Chairman ab"" should be ""In addition, Musk is giving the office of chairman up for three years"" - the model added extra explanation about German supervisory boards that wasn't in the original. The phrase ""eine dem deutschen Aufsichtsratschef vergleichbare Position"" was correctly interpreted but should end the sentence there, not continue with additional explanation

Corrected translation: As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla are each paying 20 million US dollars. In addition, Musk is giving the office of chairman up for three years."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""neumodisches Gerät"" should be ""new model gadget"" not ""new-fangled piece of equipment"" - ""new model"" is more neutral while ""new-fangled"" is somewhat pejorative. The phrase ""mal wirklich dringend gebraucht wird"" should be ""need a new model gadget to urgently work"" not ""is really needed"" - the reference emphasizes the gadget working urgently, not just being needed. The phrase ""garantiert der Akku leer"" should be ""will almost certainly be empty"" not ""is bound to be flat"" - ""empty"" is more precise than ""flat"" for batteries, and ""almost certainly"" is more measured than ""bound to be

""Schwarzgeld"" should be ""dirty money"" not ""black money"" which is the proper English term for illegal political financing.

"Initial translation: He says, in his office, a wooden hut once used as a guardhouse, 'It would be a disgrace if they were to be pulverised or disappear into a landfill site'.

Analysis: The German ""Schande"" should be ""crime"" not ""disgrace"" - while both convey disapproval, ""crime"" is stronger and more appropriate for the context. The phrase ""zu Schotter gemahlen"" should be ""ground into gravel"" not ""pulverised"" - this is more specific and accurate. The word ""Deponie"" should be ""landfill"" not ""landfill site"" - the extra word is unnecessary.

Analysis: The German ""Darsteller"" should be ""interpreters"" not ""actors"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a more general term. The phrase ""auf die er in `Sangre de mayo' stößt"" should be ""some of which fall within the cast of Sangre de mayo"" not ""he meets in 'Sangre de mayo'"" - this is a semantic error where the model simplified the meaning. The German ""müssen vor seiner Kamera wiederholen"" should be ""repeat in front of his video-camera"" not ""have to repeat themselves"" - this is a semantic error where the model made it reflexive when it should be about repeating performances. The model also changed ""Michael Rell"" to ""Miguel Rellán"" in the reference translation

Ein bewaffneter Mann hat am Montagabend eine Apotheke in der Bundesallee in Berlin-Friedenau überfallen.	"Initial translation: A man armed with a gun robbed a pharmacy on Monday evening in Berlin-Friedenau.

The phrase ""in der Bundesallee in Berlin-Friedenau"" should be ""on Bundesallee in Berlin-Friedenau"" not just ""in Berlin-Friedenau"" - the street name was omitted. The word ""überfallen"" should be ""held up"" not ""robbed"" - these are slightly different types of crimes. The model added ""with a gun"" which isn't in the German text

Analysis: The German structure ""ist sie allein"" should be ""single"" not ""wrote alone"" - the model incorrectly connected ""allein"" with the writing action rather than her relationship status. The word ""eigenartig"" should be ""weird"" not ""strange"" and ""sauer"" should be ""upset"" not ""grumpy"" - these are more precise translations.

Analysis: The German ""Geholfen wäre vielen Flüchtlingen aber auch schon mit"" should be ""But many refugees would also already be helped with"" not ""it would have helped...if there had been"" - the model changed from conditional present to past counterfactual. The phrase ""allgemeinmedizinischen Anlaufstellen"" should be ""general medicine drop-in centres"" not ""general practitioners"" - this is about centers/facilities, not individual doctors. The word ""Notfallambulanzen"" should be ""emergency rooms"" not ""emergency departments"" to match target terminology. The grammatical mood was changed from possible help to hypothetical past help

Analysis: The German ""Nur - in der Ära nach Hašek"" should be ""However, Hašek's era sees"" not ""Only - in the era after Hašek"" - the reference treats this as present ongoing situation during Hašek's era, not post-Hašek. The phrase ""brachen...erneut aus"" should be ""sees football back in quarrels"" not ""have broken out again"" - the reference frames this as current state rather than past events. The word ""Verbandskammern"" should be ""association chambers"" and the model correctly identified this. The relative clause ""die sich nicht...einigen können"" should be integrated as ""unable to agree on a common candidate"" not as a separate coordinate clause with ""and they cannot

Analysis: The German ""den Abfluss von Geld salomonisch löst"" should be ""that the deficit be resolved Solomon-style"" not ""solve the flow of money solomonically"" - this is about resolving a deficit, not managing cash flow. The phrase ""greift die CEZ-Aktiendividenden an"" should be ""it should draw on ČEZ dividends"" not ""will take the dividends"" - this is about utilizing resources, not taking them. The phrase ""aus diesen dann das Geld in den Verkehrsfonds ausgeschüttet werden"" should be ""and use those to top up the transport fund"" not ""put the money into the transport funds"" - singular fund, not plural

Analysis: The German ""spüren"" should be ""sense"" not ""work out"" - sensing is more intuitive while working out is more analytical. The phrase ""von Geselligkeit erschöpft"" should be ""exhausted from socialising"" not ""has had enough of socialising"" - exhaustion is a stronger physical state than just having enough.

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""es ebenso wenig ein wie ein Teufelswerk ein Wundermittel zur Erzeugung von Elektrizität gibt"" is complex, meaning there is neither a miraculous nor diabolical source for electricity production. The model's translation ""no magic bullet, no more than there is a devil's work"" is incomplete and awkward - it fails to complete the thought about electricity production. The reference clearly states ""no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity"" which completes the intended meaning.

Und weil er in der Krisenkommunikation danach so ziemlich alles falsch machte, was man falsch machen kann.	"Initial translation: And because he has made such a complete mess of crisis communication.

Analysis: The German ""in der Krisenkommunikation danach"" should be ""in the crisis talks afterwards"" not ""crisis communication"" - this is about talks/discussions, not general communication. The phrase ""so ziemlich alles falsch machte, was man falsch machen kann"" should be ""he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong"" not ""made such a complete mess"" - the target preserves the specific phrasing about doing everything wrong. The model condensed the detailed expression into a general summary, losing the specific meaning. The word ""danach"" meaning ""afterwards"" was omitted from the model translation

Corrected translation: And because in the crisis talks afterwards, he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""stieß...mit...an"" means ""clicked glasses with"" (a toast) not ""hit back at"" - the model completely misunderstood this as an attack rather than a friendly toast. The phrase ""der Funktionär aus Guangzhou"" should be ""the official from Guangzhou"" not ""The Guangzhou official"" - different word order. The phrase ""allerdings mit Rotwein"" should be ""albeit with red wine"" not ""with a glass of red wine"" - the model added ""glass"" and missed the concessive ""albeit

Bei diesem Panorama und im Unterschied zu den Personenkraftwagen, haben die finanziellen Unterstützungen beim Kauf eines Fahrzeugs des Plans 2000E wenig geholfen.	"Initial translation: In this context and unlike cars, the financial support for the purchase of a 2000E vehicle has not been very helpful.

Analysis: The German ""Bei diesem Panorama"" should be translated as ""In light of this"" not ""In this context"", as ""Panorama"" here refers to the overall situation/outlook rather than literal context. The phrase ""Plan 2000E"" was incorrectly expanded to ""2000E vehicle"" when it should remain as ""2000E purchase"" referring to a specific aid plan. The phrase ""wenig geholfen"" was translated as ""has not been very helpful"" but should be the stronger ""has done little"" to match the reference meaning

The phrase ""unter 1,5 Millionen Kontrollen"" (out of 1.5 million controls) was completely omitted from the translation. The German ""ungerechtfertigt oder zu lang"" should be ""unjustified or too long"" not ""inadequate or excessive"" - losing the precise legal terminology. The word ""realisierten"" (carried out/performed) was also omitted

Ich glaubte, die Fahrt nach Hause nicht mehr zu schaffen.	"Initial translation: I thought I would not make it home.

Analysis: The German ""Ich glaubte, die Fahrt nach Hause nicht mehr zu schaffen"" means ""I didn't think I was going to be able to drive all the way home"" but the model simplified this to ""make it home"" losing the specific reference to driving (""Fahrt""). The phrase ""nicht mehr zu schaffen"" emphasizes the physical/mental capability to complete the journey, which the reference captures with ""be able to drive all the way home"" while the model's ""make it home"" is more generic. The reference better preserves the sense of doubt about completing the specific act of driving home

Analysis: The German ""Einstellung...zum sog.

The technical term ""Schwarz-System"" was completely omitted, which appears to be the ""Svarc System"" mentioned in the reference - this is likely a specific policy or legal framework that was entirely lost. The phrase ""negatives Praxisbeispiel"" should be ""example of improper practice"" not just ""negative example of practice"" which is less precise

Analysis: The German ""auf die Opencard aufspielen"" should be ""add the electronic coupons to the Opencard"" not ""played on self-service machines"" - the model lost the specific Opencard system and the concept of loading/adding to a card. The phrase ""in einigen U-Bahn-Vestibüls"" should be ""in several vestibules of the metro"" not ""in some underground stations"" - vestibules are specific entrance areas, not stations generally. The verb ""aufspielen"" means to load/upload to a card system, not to play generally. The model missed the technical context of electronic payment systems

Analysis: The German text doesn't mention ""House of Parliament"" - this appears to be completely added by the model. The phrase ""bekam das Haus...den Spitznamen"" should be ""started to call it the House of bones"" not ""called the House of Parliament 'bone house'"" - the model inserted an incorrect building identification. The phrase ""Knochenhaus"" should be ""House of bones"" not ""bone house"" - different capitalization and structure. The phrase ""mit seinen organischen Formen"" should be ""for its organic shapes"" not ""because of its organic forms"" - different causal structure

"""Sie glaubten, wenn sie heimkämen, würde ihnen das Tschechische zu passe kommen"", so Chalupa."	"Initial translation: Chalupa said that they thought that when they came home, they would be able to speak Czech.

Analysis: The German ""zu passe kommen"" should be ""come in handy"" not ""be able to speak"" - this is about usefulness, not ability. The phrase implies the language would be useful/beneficial, not that they would gain the ability to speak it. The idiom ""zu passe kommen"" means to be convenient or useful, not to gain a skill

Am Ende des Erhöhungszyklus fallen die Anleiherenditen sofort, sagte die Deutsche Bank.	"Initial translation: At the end of the cycle, the interest rates on bonds will immediately rise, according to Deutsche Bank.

Analysis: The German ""fallen die Anleiherenditen sofort"" should be ""bond yields fall immediately"" not ""will immediately rise"" - the model reversed the direction from falling to rising. The phrase ""Deutsche Bank"" should be ""Deutsche"" according to the target - this appears to be a shortened reference. The word ""Erhöhungszyklus"" should be ""hiking cycle"" not just ""cycle"" - this is about interest rate hiking cycles. The fundamental economic direction was completely reversed, changing the meaning from bonds becoming more attractive to less attractive

Analysis: The German ""Der Hamelner"" refers to ""the Hamelin player"" (a person from Hamelin) but was translated as ""the Hameln"" which treats it as a place rather than a person. The phrase ""die Setzliste anführt"" should be ""is the top seed"" not ""leading the list"" - in sports contexts, ""top seed"" is the proper terminology. The verb ""erinnerte"" means ""remembers"" not ""reminds us"" - the model changed who is doing the remembering.

Analysis: The German ""Nach dem Einsatz von Streufahrzeugen"" should be ""as a result of chemical treatment"" not ""after snowploughing"" - Streufahrzeuge are salt/grit spreaders, not snowploughs. The word ""Schneematsch"" should be understood as the result of chemical treatment, not remaining snow. The phrase ""bleibt Schneematsch"" describes the slush that results from chemical treatment, not leftover snow.

Instead, the model created a question about whether it's enough to fill the team, completely inverting the meaning.

Der Bayern-Legionär ist ja quasi Klubkollege von ÖFB-Kapitänin Schnaderbeck und fiebert mit unseren Ladys mit.	"Initial translation: The Bavarian Legionnaire is, in fact, a clubmate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is in love with our ladies.

Analysis: The German ""fiebert mit unseren Ladys mit"" should be ""cheers our ladies on"" not ""is in love with our ladies"" - the model completely misunderstood ""mitfiebern"" (to cheer on/support enthusiastically) as romantic love. The phrase ""Bayern-Legionär"" should be ""Bayern legionnaire"" not ""Bavarian Legionnaire"" - this refers to Bayern Munich football club, not Bavaria the region. The phrase ""ÖFB-Kapitänin"" should be ""ÖFB captain"" not ""ÖFB captain"" - though this is correct, the context suggests this is about sports team support, not romance

"Initial translation: Whether his own package is watertight at all points and whether it is actually 'palatable' for the coalition partner will have to be seen.

Analysis: The German ""verfassungsfest"" means ""constitutional/in line with the constitution"" not ""watertight"" - this is a legal term about constitutional compliance. The word ""zumutbar"" means ""reasonable/acceptable"" not ""palatable"" - it's about what can reasonably be expected. The phrase refers to ""citizens"" not ""coalition partner"" - this changes the political context. The phrase structure should be ""However, it remains to be seen"" not ""will have to be seen""

Corrected translation: However, it remains to be seen whether his own package is in line with the constitution throughout, and whether it really is ""achievable"" for his coalition partner."	error_correction
"Das Bundesumweltministerium erklärt auf seiner Homepage im Hinblick auf die geltenden Höchstwerte aber, dass eine ""gesundheitliche Gefährdung der Allgemeinbevölkerung"" nicht zu erwarten sei."	"Initial translation: However, the Federal Environment Ministry's website states that it is not expected that the maximum values will be exceeded.

Analysis: The German ""Bundesumweltministerium"" should be ""German Environment Minister"" not ""Federal Environment Ministry"" - the target specifies the minister personally rather than the ministry as an institution. The German content ""dass eine 'gesundheitliche Gefährdung der Allgemeinbevölkerung' nicht zu erwarten sei"" should be ""that a 'health risk to the general population' is not anticipated"" but the model changed this to ""maximum values will be exceeded"" - completely different meaning. The phrase ""auf seiner Homepage"" should be ""on his home page"" not ""website"" to match the personal attribution

"""Die Überzeugung kam aber nicht nur wegen der Ernährung, sondern aufgrund der Schuhwahl"", sagt Proctor, der Kunstleder normalem Leder vorzieht."	"Initial translation: Proctor is also convinced that the shoes are the key to the success of the diet.

Analysis: The German quote ""Die Überzeugung kam aber nicht nur wegen der Ernährung, sondern aufgrund der Schuhwahl"" was completely lost and replaced with a different statement. The model omitted the critical information about Proctor preferring ""Kunstleder normalem Leder"" (artificial leather over normal leather). The quote structure was destroyed and turned into indirect speech. The model created a completely different meaning about diet success rather than personal conviction about lifestyle choices

Corrected translation: ""However, it wasn't just the diet that convinced me, but also my choice of shoes,"" said Proctor, who prefers artificial leather over normal leather."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""Böllerer"" refers to ""cannon shooters"" (people who operate cannons) but was left as ""Böller"" which doesn't translate the meaning for English readers. The term ""Böllertreffens"" should be ""Cannon Meeting"" not ""Böller meeting"" - the English needs the full translation.

Analysis: The German ""Vereinbarung darüber, dass es zu einer Verabschiedung kommt"" should be ""agreement that the approval will take place"" not ""agreement to adopt"" - ""Verabschiedung"" in this context means approval/passage (of legislation), not adoption. The phrase ""ist in diesem Moment das Wichtigste"" should be ""is the most important thing at this time"" not ""at the moment"" - ""this time"" is more formal. The word ""betonte"" should be ""emphasized"" not ""said"" for stronger expression. The model misunderstood the legislative context of approval/passage

gab aber zu, dass in China Größenvorgaben in Stellenanzeigen für beiderlei Geschlecht nicht unüblich sind.	"Initial translation: admitted that in China, there are cases of job advertisements specifying the size of the applicant.

The phrase ""dass in China Größenvorgaben in Stellenanzeigen für beiderlei Geschlecht nicht unüblich sind"" should be ""that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes"" not ""there are cases of job advertisements specifying the size of the applicant"" - the model missed ""both sexes,"" changed ""height"" to generic ""size,"" and understated ""standard"" as just ""cases

Für die Brücken zwischen dem Bauhofgebäude und dem Sammelweiher in Richtung Schramberg ist der Verkehr einspurig durch eine Ampel geregelt.	"Initial translation: Traffic is one-way through a traffic light on the bridge between the building and the pond at Schramberg.

Analysis: The German ""Brücken"" (plural) should be ""bridges"" not ""bridge"" (singular) - there are multiple bridges. The phrase ""Bauhofgebäude"" should be ""construction yard building"" not just ""building"" - missing the specific type. The word ""Sammelweiher"" should be ""lake reservoir"" not ""pond"" - this is a larger water collection facility. The phrase ""einspurig durch eine Ampel geregelt"" should be ""single-lane and regulated by lights"" not ""one-way through a traffic light"" - single-lane means alternating directions, not permanent one-way flow. The model lost precision in infrastructure terminology and traffic control concepts

Analysis: The German suggests positive impact, not mockery. The phrase ""wesentlich mehr als ein Ausdruck"" was translated literally when ""go far beyond any word"" is more natural. The structure and emotional tone were generally captured but the meaning was completely reversed in the final clause

Analysis: The German phrase ""in Schwierigkeiten geratenen"" should be ""troubled"" not ""in difficulties"" - more concise. The phrase ""können allerdings damit rechnen"" should be ""should count on that"" not ""can expect"" - different modal meaning. The German ""Abfertigungen, die im Übersee-Slang salopp 'Golden Handshake' genannt werden"" should be ""severance - which is simply called golden parachute in the overseas slang"" but the model omits the explanation and uses ""golden handshakes"" instead of ""golden parachute

Doch das soll sich ändern: Die Rechtsabbiegespur soll verlängert werden.	"Initial translation: However, this is to change: the legal brake is to be extended.

Analysis: The German ""Rechtsabbiegespur"" should be ""right-hand turning lane"" not ""legal brake"" - this is a major lexical error where the model completely mistranslated a compound noun. The word ""Rechts"" means ""right"" (direction) not ""legal"", and ""abbiegespur"" means ""turning lane"" not ""brake"". This is a semantic error that completely changes the meaning from road infrastructure to legal/braking concepts. The model preserved the sentence structure correctly but the core meaning is entirely wrong

Tatsächlich war es bald ein familiäres Miteinander bei Kaffee und Kuchen von den Ehrenamtlichen des Kulturbahnhofs.	"Initial translation: In fact, it was not long before there was a family atmosphere of coffee and cake among the volunteers at the Culture Station.

The phrase ""von den Ehrenamtlichen"" should be ""from the volunteers"" not ""among the volunteers"" - they provided the coffee and cake.

Analysis: This translation is confusing and doesn't capture the meaning properly. The German ""kann es sich zweifelsohne nicht leisten... zu verwirken"" should be about not being able to afford to squander/forfeit the situation, but the model translated this as ""to be able to do without

"Initial translation: The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the quarter-finals of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third division club FC Würzburger Kickers has now been definitively scheduled.

Analysis: The German ""Achtelfinale"" should be ""last 16"" not ""quarter-finals"" - wrong tournament stage (Achtelfinale = round of 16, Viertelfinale = quarter-finals). The phrase ""Bayerischen Fußball Totopokals"" should be ""Bavarian football pools cup"" not ""Bavarian Football Totopokals"" - the German name should be translated to English. The word ""terminiert"" should be ""scheduled"" which the model got correct, but ""definitively"" should be ""finally"" - slightly different emphasis.

Analysis: The German ""irgendwelche Videos"" should be ""I do not know what videos"" not ""some videos"" - the speaker is emphasizing uncertainty about the content. The phrase ""aufs E-Mail geschickt"" should be ""to the email"" not ""by e-mail"" to match the target's phrasing. The ending ""so ein Mist"" should be part of the speaker's frustration in the quote, and the target preserves the stream-of-consciousness flow better than the model's punctuated version.

"Initial translation: The bridge festival brought the Bavarian neighbours together socially on Sunday, having run a 2-Bridge race on Saturday organised by the Union Wernstein and Bayern aus Neukirchen.

Analysis: The model misunderstood the complex sentence structure and relationship between events. The German should be understood as describing the Bridge Festival as a joint effort where ""the Bridge Festival Association organises the social event on Sunday and an athletic two bridge walk the day before with their Bavarian neighbours"" - the reference shows this as an ongoing organizational structure, not just a past event. The phrase ""tags zuvor"" should be ""the day before"" and the model correctly identified this, but lost the organizational context. The grammatical structure using ""having run"" creates confusion about timing and causation

The word ""Festzelt"" should be ""party tent"" not just ""big tent"" - missing the festive context.

The phrase ""die Informationen betreffend Zuständigen"" should be ""information clerks"" not ""people responsible for the information"" - more specific terminology.

"Sie erwähnte auch den neuen Mann von Witwe Dash und schrieb dass Lee Glenn ""Getränke jeglicher Art verkauft und was-auch-immer zu Stundenzimmern passt."""	"Initial translation: She also mentioned the new man in Mrs Dash's life, Lee Glenn, who'sells all kinds of drinks and whatever suits the hour'.

Analysis: The German ""Witwe Dash"" should be ""Widow Dash"" not ""Mrs Dash"" - losing the important detail about her marital status. The phrase ""was-auch-immer zu Stundenzimmern passt"" should be ""whatever goes with transient rooms"" not ""whatever suits the hour"" - completely missing the concept of hourly rental rooms. The word ""Stundenzimmern"" refers to rooms rented by the hour, typically for transient purposes, not time-based activities. The punctuation is also incorrect with missing quotation marks

Corrected translation: She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn ""sells drinks of all kinds and whatever goes with transient rooms."""	error_correction
Ihren Worten zufolge könnte es noch am Sonntag zu einer Endabstimmung kommen.	"Initial translation: According to you, there may be a final vote on Sunday.

Analysis: The German ""Ihren Worten zufolge"" should be ""According to her"" not ""According to you"" - ""Ihren"" is third person feminine (her words), not second person (your words). This is a basic pronoun error that changes who is being quoted. The phrase ""könnte es noch am Sonntag zu einer Endabstimmung kommen"" should be ""the final vote could take place as early as Sunday"" not ""there may be a final vote on Sunday"" - the reference emphasizes the earliness (""as early as"") and uses ""take place"" rather than just existence

Corrected translation: According to her, the final vote could take place as early as Sunday."	error_correction

Es handelt sich überwiegend um die im Wettbewerb gewonnenen Abschnitte, die man nicht mehr neu projektieren und eventuell verbilligen kann.	"Initial translation: It is mostly about the competitive sections that cannot be re-projected and possibly discounted.

Analysis: The German ""im Wettbewerb gewonnenen Abschnitte"" should be ""sections that have been tendered out"" not ""competitive sections"" - this refers to construction contracts won through competitive bidding. The phrase ""die man nicht mehr neu projektieren"" should be ""cannot be redesigned"" not ""cannot be re-projected"" - architectural/engineering context requires ""redesigned"". The key phrase ""are half-finished"" is completely omitted from the translation, losing important information about the construction state. The word ""verbilligen"" should be ""made any cheaper"" not ""discounted"" in this construction context

"Auf die Antworte beide, denn die Jets ließen im dritten Viertel 21 Punkte zu ohne einen einzigen zu erzielen, sagte Mangini: ""Glaub mir, ich habe das zweite Viertel mehr genossen als das dritte."	"Initial translation: Answer both, because the Jets scored 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single one, Mangini said: 'Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.

Analysis: The opening ""Answer both"" should be ""When he was told both"" - the German ""Auf die Antworte beide"" refers to being informed of both facts, not giving answers. The phrase ""ließen...21 Punkte zu"" means ""allowed 21 unanswered points"" not ""scored 21 points"" - this reverses who scored the points. The word ""unanswered"" is omitted, which is crucial context in sports. The grammatical structure ""When he was told both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said"" is broken in the model's version. The closing quotation mark is missing, creating incomplete punctuation

The phrase should maintain the quote structure and flow better. The model shortened the technical legal language but lost precision. The punctuation and quote formatting could be improved

The model also changed ""durchfahren"" (drive through) to ""negotiated"" which is less specific.

Wir haben ihn wohl oft mit dem Fuß in Schalen voll Vinaigrette, in Saucen, Gebäck oder anderen Lebensmitteln stehen sehen, und dies für ziemlich geschmacklos gehalten, obwohl wir es anfangs noch lustig fanden.	"Initial translation: We have often seen him standing on a plate full of vinaigrette, sauces, cakes and other foods, and we thought it was disgusting, although we used to laugh at it at first.

Analysis: The German sentence is about seeing someone's face/image on food packaging (""mug shots on jars""), but the model translated it literally as him physically standing on a plate. The phrase ""mit dem Fuß in Schalen"" doesn't mean ""standing on a plate"" but refers to his image appearing on containers. The context is about celebrity endorsements on food products, not physical presence. The word ""Gebäck"" means ""biscuits"" not ""cakes"". The model also added content about reactions (""disgusting"", ""laugh at it"") that doesn't appear in the German source

Das Smartphone ist 20 Jahre nach seiner Erfindung eine Selbstverständlichkeit.	"Initial translation: The smartphone is 20 years after its invention, a given.

Analysis: The grammatical structure places ""20 years after its invention"" as an awkward parenthetical that disrupts the sentence flow. The German ""Das Smartphone"" should be ""smartphones"" (plural) as in the reference, not ""The smartphone"" (singular with definite article). The word ""Selbstverständlichkeit"" should be ""a fact of life"" not ""a given"" - while both convey obviousness, ""fact of life"" better captures the integration into daily existence. The comma placement creates an unnatural pause in English

Corrected translation: 20 years after their invention, smartphones are a fact of life."	error_correction
Der Gesinnungswandel des griechischen Wahr-Falsch-Referendums hätte in dieser Hinsicht doppelt aufschlussreichen Charakter gehabt: einmal den der Notwendigkeit einer kraftvollen Rückkehr der Politik, auf der anderen Seite aber auch denjenigen des beunruhigenden Gefühls von deren Unmöglichkeit, ihrer Unangebrachtheit.	"Initial translation: The change of heart of the Greek referendum would have been doubly revealing: firstly, the need for a strong return of politics, and secondly, the feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.

Analysis: The German ""Gesinnungswandel"" was translated as ""change of heart"" when it should be ""palinode"" (a formal recantation), which is more precise in this political context. The phrase ""Wahr-Falsch-Referendums"" was simplified to just ""referendum"" when it should specify ""true-false Greek referendum

Corrected translation: In this respect, the palinode of a true-false Greek referendum will have a double revelatory value, that of a need of a powerful reversal of policy, but also that of the worrying sentiment of its impossibility and of its incongruity."	error_correction
"""Voraussetzung ist, aber, dass wir noch besser harmonieren und wir uns im Aufbau nicht so viele Abspielfehler leisten."""	"Initial translation: But we must do better at harmonisation and we must not make so many mistakes in the construction phase.

The phrase ""dass wir noch besser harmonieren"" should be ""that we harmonise even better together"" not ""do better at harmonisation"" - the reference emphasizes togetherness and uses ""even better

The company name should be ""Commercial Mexicana"" not ""Comercial Mexicana"" - the English equivalent name should be used.

The phrase ""Krankenhaus GmbH des Landkreises"" should be ""district's limited company hospital"" not ""hospital company of the district"" - the target emphasizes the legal structure (GmbH = limited company). The phrase ""Landrätin"" should be ""district administrator"" not ""district president"" - different administrative title.

Zu ihrer Überraschung ließ das Miauen auch die Männchen nicht kalt - allerdings verhielten sie sich im Unterschied zu den Weibchen immer gleich.	"Initial translation: The males were also surprised by the meowing, but they remained silent, just as the females did.

The phrase ""ließ das Miauen auch die Männchen nicht kalt"" should be ""the miaowing didn't leave the male cats unaffected"" not ""remained silent"" - this is about emotional response, not silence. The key phrase ""im Unterschied zu den Weibchen immer gleich"" should be ""compared to their female counterparts, they always acted the same way"" not ""just as the females did"" - the model reversed the comparison, suggesting similarity when it should show consistent male behavior contrasted with varied female behavior.

Dieser Stoff wird als krebserregend betrachtet, und es gibt nun Alternativen auf dem Markt, sodass die Verwendung dieses Hormons überflüssig ist und ganz verboten werden kann.

Meiner Meinung nach sollten dann, wenn nach einer Erhöhung der Beiträge von Mitgliedstaaten um lediglich die Inflationsrate nicht genügend Finanzmittel zur Verfügung stehen, Wege gefunden werden sollten, um Haushaltslinien neu zuzuweisen, damit Defizite ausgeglichen werden können.

Auffällig ist, dass in den letzten Wochen geradezu die klassischen Bürgergruppen die größte Distanz zur CSU äußerten: die freien Berufe, das gewerbliche Bürgertum und Wähler mit Abitur wie Hochschulabschluss.	"Initial translation: It is striking that in recent weeks, it is precisely the traditional citizen groups that have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the self-employed, the middle class and the voters with a high school or university degree.

Analysis: The German ""freien Berufe"" means ""liberal professions"" but was translated as ""the self-employed"" which is less specific - liberal professions refers to professional services like doctors, lawyers, etc. The phrase ""gewerbliche Bürgertum"" means ""commercial/industrial middle class"" but was simplified to just ""middle class"" losing the economic specificity. The term ""Abitur"" is specifically the German secondary school leaving certificate but was generalized to ""high school"" degree. The model's translation is more accessible but loses precision about German social and educational categories

Corrected translation: What is also remarkable is that during the last weeks, mainly classical civil groups were departing from CSU; people of the liberal professions, industrial workers, people with secondary school certificate, people with college or university degree."	error_correction
Aber welcher neu ankommende Vorsitzende würde es riskieren, anzutreten, auf alles einzuschlagen und eine Institution auseinanderzunehmen, die so komplex ist wie eine chinesische Dynastie, während er sich dabei selbst vielleicht um seinen Job bringt.	"Initial translation: But which new President would dare to take on everything and try to change an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while at the same time perhaps risking his own job.

Analysis: The German ""Vorsitzende"" should be ""chairman"" not ""President"" - this is about corporate leadership, not political office. The phrase ""anzutreten, auf alles einzuschlagen"" should be ""coming in, crashing around"" not ""dare to take on everything"" - this is about aggressive action, not just taking responsibility. The word ""auseinanderzunehmen"" should be ""dismantling"" not ""try to change"" - this is about destruction, not reform. The phrase ""sich dabei selbst vielleicht um seinen Job bringt"" should be ""in case they put themselves out of a job in the process"" not ""risking his own job"" - the target is more specific about the consequence

Corrected translation: But what incoming chairman would risk coming in, crashing around and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process."	error_correction
Ich werde hier nichts anlecken, weil es hier drinnen ekelhaft ist.	"Initial translation: I will not touch it here because it is disgusting in here.

Analysis: The German ""anlecken"" should be ""lick"" not ""touch"" - completely different action. The phrase ""hier drinnen"" should be ""in there"" not ""in here"" - different spatial reference point. The rest of the translation is structurally correct, but the key action is wrong

Corrected translation: I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there."	error_correction
Und die Geißel des Mesotheliom ist nicht auf ehemaliger Arbeiter der Baubranche beschränkt.	"Initial translation: And the whip of mesothelioma is not confined to former workers in the construction industry.

Analysis: The German ""Geißel"" means ""scourge"" not ""whip"" - while both are literal meanings, ""scourge"" is the appropriate metaphorical term for a disease/plague. The phrase ""ehemaliger Arbeiter"" should be ""veterans"" not ""former workers"" in this context about occupational disease. The term ""Baubranche"" is ""building industry"" but ""industrial building jobs"" is more specific to the hazardous exposure context. The model's translation is too literal

Corrected translation: And the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs."	error_correction

Corrected translation: Anyone can handle the operation of the simplest - not necessarily the most inexpensive (see our selection) - music players."	error_correction
Die haben zwar eine schottische Tradition, sind aber auf dem Kaltenhof schwäbisch angehaucht.	"Initial translation: They may have a Scottish tradition, but they are Swabian at heart.

Analysis: The model missed the specific location ""auf dem Kaltenhof"" (at the Kaltenhof event grounds) which is crucial context. The phrase ""schwäbisch angehaucht"" means ""given a touch of Swabian colour"" not ""Swabian at heart"" - ""angehaucht"" suggests a light influence, not a core identity. The model also simplified the contrast structure and lost the geographical specificity. The translation became too general when the German is quite specific about a particular venue and cultural adaptation

Corrected translation: While they are of course a Scottish tradition, they have been given a touch of Swabian colour at the Kaltenhof event grounds."	error_correction

Wem technische Abkürzungen nicht liegen, der mag sie bei ihrem Spitznamen Südliches Feuerrad nennen.	"Initial translation: If you do not have technical short cuts, you may call it the Southern Firewheel.

Scherben, Zigarettenkippen, Müll und Unrat, demolierte Mülleimer und mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder - so präsentiert sich seit Längerem der Einstieg mit Sitzgruppe zum Radweg auf dem Haaße-Hügel in Treysa.	"Initial translation: Broken glass, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, demolished bins and now defunct signposts - this is how the entrance to the Haaße hill in Treysa has looked for some time.

Analysis: The German ""Scherben"" should be ""shards"" not ""broken glass"" - less specific term. The phrase ""mittlerweile demontierte Hinweisschilder"" should be ""now dismantled signs"" not ""now defunct signposts"" - ""demontiert"" means physically taken apart, not just non-functional. The German ""Sitzgruppe zum Radweg"" (seating area to the bike path) was completely omitted from the translation - missing important detail about the facilities. The word ""präsentiert sich"" should be ""presents itself"" not ""has looked"" - different verb choice and formality. The repetition ""rubbish and rubbish"" shows the model struggled with ""Müll und Unrat"" which should be ""garbage and rubbish

Mit den harten und platzierten Aufschlägen taten sich die Gönninger äußerst schwer.	"Initial translation: The beneficiaries found it very difficult to cope with the hard and fast rules.

Analysis: The German ""Gönninger"" should be ""Gönningen"" (a place/team name) not ""beneficiaries"" - this is a proper noun referring to a sports team or location. The phrase ""harten und platzierten Aufschlägen"" should be ""hard and well-positioned offensive moves"" not ""hard and fast rules"" - this is about sports serves/attacks, not regulations. The model completely misunderstood the sports context and turned it into a bureaucratic scenario

Insgesamt seien vier Verkehrsschauen durchgeführt worden, auch ein Kreisverkehr wurde angedacht, allerdings wegen der Enge in dem Kreuzungsbereich Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße wieder verworfen.	"Initial translation: Four traffic exhibitions have been held, including one roundabout, but the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße junction has led to the roundabout being abandoned.

Analysis: The German ""Verkehrsschauen"" should be ""road safety inspections"" not ""traffic exhibitions"" - these are formal safety assessments, not public displays. The phrase ""auch ein Kreisverkehr wurde angedacht"" should be ""and a roundabout was also considered"" not ""including one roundabout"" - this was considered but not built. The phrase ""wegen der Enge in dem Kreuzungsbereich"" should be ""on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junctions"" not ""but the narrowness of the junction has led to"" - the model structure suggests the roundabout was built then abandoned, when it was only considered then rejected

Corrected translation: A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered, however, this idea was rejected on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junctions."	error_correction

Nicht nur was das Leistungsvermögen betrifft, war die ganze Bandbreite an Sportlern vertreten.	"Initial translation: Not only in terms of performance, but also in terms of the whole range of sportspeople, there was a great deal of representation.

Analysis: The German ""Nicht nur was das Leistungsvermögen betrifft"" should be ""And it was not only about top performance"" - the model missed the emphasis that it's NOT just about top performance. The phrase ""war die ganze Bandbreite an Sportlern vertreten"" means ""the entire range of athletic ability was represented"" but the model's version is awkward and unclear. The meaning is about diverse skill levels being welcome, not just elite athletes. The structure is redundant

Corrected translation: And it was not only about top performance - the entire range of athletic ability was represented."	error_correction

Wie immer gibt es auch mürrische Spielverderber, die sich immer über etwas beschweren müssen.	"Initial translation: As always, there are also grumpy people who always have to complain about something.

Analysis: The German ""mürrische Spielverderber"" should be ""po-faced killjoys"" not ""grumpy people"" - this is more colorful, specific language describing people who spoil fun in a sourly serious way. The phrase ""die sich immer über etwas beschweren müssen"" should be ""looking for something to complain about"" not ""who always have to complain about something"" - the reference suggests active seeking rather than compulsive behavior.

Alassane Pléa erweist sich im Sturm der Fohlen zusehends als Goalgetter.	"Initial translation: Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goal-getter in the storm of the foals.

The phrase ""mit einer erfahrenen Mannschaft auf der anderen Netzseite"" should be ""stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team"" not ""had a team of experienced players on the other side"" - missing the emphatic ""undoubtedly"" meaning and the specific ""net"" reference.

Analysis: The German ""Bezaubernde Jeannie"" should be translated as ""I Dream of Jeannie"" but the model left out this title completely and added content not in the original. The phrase ""netter Typ"" means ""decent guy"" not ""kindly patriarch"" - the model added the patriarchal role which wasn't in the German.

The phrase ""Als Vorbild...führte...an"" should be ""As an example...led the project"" not ""was the inspiration for"" - the meaning is that he cited the French project as a model, not that he inspired the German project. The organization name ""Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde"" should be ""Wolfratshausen castle friends"" not ""Wolfratshofen Castle Friends"" due to the location error.

Hand aufs Herz - das ist wohl allen Frauen eigen.	"Initial translation: Hand on heart - that is probably true of all women.

Analysis: The German ""Hand aufs Herz"" should be ""Let's be frank"" not ""Hand on heart"" - this is an idiomatic expression meaning ""let's be honest/frank,"" not a literal gesture. The phrase ""das ist wohl allen Frauen eigen"" should be ""this is probably the nature all women"" not ""that is probably true of all women"" - missing the word ""nature"" and slightly different emphasis. The model translated the idiom too literally, losing the conversational frankness implication. The German idiom implies a moment of honest admission rather than a literal heart gesture

Analysis: The translation is incomplete - it cuts off with ""at least"" without completing the thought. The German ""schlimmstenfalls"" should be ""at best"" not ""at least"" - this reverses the meaning from worst case to best case. The phrase ""oder bestenfalls"" appears incomplete in both German and English, but the model should handle this more gracefully.

The phrase ""das werde ich tun"" should be ""and that is what I will do"" not ""and I will"" - the target is more specific about doing that particular thing

Corrected translation: A re-election should be attempted and that is what I will do."	error_correction
"Die sagt: ""Eigentlich müsste meine Wiktoria in der zehnten Klasse im Gymnasium sitzen."""	"Initial translation: She says: 'My Victoria really ought to be in the tenth grade at school.'

Analysis: '""
The German name ""Wiktoria"" should be preserved as ""Viktoria"" not changed to ""Victoria"" - these are different name spellings and the original should be maintained.  The phrase ""im Gymnasium"" should be ""in the grammar school"" not just ""at school"" - Gymnasium is a specific type of secondary school that should be identified.  The model simplified both the name and the school type, losing cultural and educational specificity

Corrected translation: She says: ""My Viktoria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the grammar school at the moment."""	error_correction
Hingegen fordert der Gründer der Dienstleistungsgruppe laut Familienprotokollen das Nutzungsrecht über 51% des Kapitals.	"Initial translation: On the other hand, according to the family protocols, the founder of the services group is demanding 51% of the capital.

Analysis: The German ""Nutzungsrecht"" (usufruct - legal right to use something) was completely omitted and simplified to just ""demanding 51% of the capital"" when it should be ""claims...the usufruct on 51% of the capital"" - this is a significant legal concept that was lost. The word ""Familienprotokollen"" was translated as ""family protocols"" but the reference uses ""familiar protocols"" - this might be a transcription issue or different interpretation. The overall structure changed the legal precision of the original claim

Corrected translation: The founder of the service group claims, nevertheless, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols."	error_correction
"""Hin und wieder überkommt einen solch ein Gefühl"", erklärte Jágr, nach dessen Aktion Giroux schon beim ersten Schuss der Flyers ein Tor erzielte."	"Initial translation: Jágr said, after Giroux's action, that he had 'a feeling' that he would score.

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""nach dessen Aktion Giroux schon beim ersten Schuss der Flyers ein Tor erzielte"" means ""after whose action Giroux scored"" - the model completely reversed who performed the action and when the scoring happened. The phrase ""Hin und wieder überkommt einen solch ein Gefühl"" should be ""You sometimes feel such things"" not ""had 'a feeling' that he would score"" - the model made it specific and predictive rather than general and reflective. The model also omitted the fact that this was on the ""first Flyers' shot"" and misattributed the sequence of events

Corrected translation: ""You sometimes feel such things,"" explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal on the first Flyers"" shot."	error_correction

"""Ich dachte, die Wehen würden einsetzen. Ich rannte schreiend aus dem Gerichtssaal."""	"Initial translation: I thought the pains would start, and I ran out of the courtroom screaming.

Analysis: The German ""Wehen"" should be ""labor"" not ""pains"" - in medical context, ""Wehen"" specifically refers to labor contractions during childbirth. The phrase ""Wehen würden einsetzen"" should be ""I was going to go into labor"" not ""the pains would start"" - this is about the onset of childbirth, not general pain. The quotation marks are missing from the model's translation. The coordinating conjunction should be ""I ran screaming from the courtroom"" not ""and I ran out of the courtroom screaming"" - the reference uses ""from"" not ""out of"" and omits ""and

Corrected translation: ""I thought I was going to go into labor - I ran screaming from the courtroom."""	error_correction

In der kommenden Nacht bricht in den Tälern der Alpennordseite der Föhn durch, wie Meteoschweiz am Dienstag mitteilte.	"Initial translation: Tonight, the valleys of the Alpine north side will be hit by a föhn, as MeteoSwiss announced on Monday.

Analysis: The German ""Meteoschweiz"" was correctly identified as ""MeteoSwiss"" but the day was changed from ""Dienstag"" (Tuesday) to ""Monday"" - this is a factual error about when the announcement was made. The phrase ""In der kommenden Nacht"" means ""in the coming night"" but was translated as ""Tonight"" which is less specific about timing. The word ""bricht...durch"" means ""breaks through"" but was translated as ""will be hit by"" which changes from the weather phenomenon breaking through to valleys being struck. The reference preserves ""foehn will break through"" which better captures the meteorological action

Corrected translation: The foehn will break through in the valleys on the northen side of the Alps in the coming night, Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday."	error_correction

Wie vielen anderen Vereinen macht auch den Jazzgruppen im TV Jahn der Ganztagsunterricht an den weiterführenden Schulen zu schaffen.	"Initial translation: Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV are also faced with the problem of full-time teaching at the secondary schools.

Analysis: The German ""macht auch den Jazzgruppen im TV Jahn der Ganztagsunterricht...zu schaffen"" should be ""the jazz group also runs a day-long class in TV Jahn in order to make it to the prep school"" not ""are also faced with the problem of full-time teaching"" - completely different meaning. The model misunderstood the causality: the jazz groups are struggling because of all-day school (students unavailable), not because they're doing the teaching. The phrase ""TV Jahn"" was truncated to just ""TV"" - missing part of the organization name. The word ""weiterführenden Schulen"" should be ""prep school"" not ""secondary schools"" - different educational terminology. The model reversed the subject-object relationship entirely

Corrected translation: Like many other clubs, the jazz group also runs a day-long class in TV Jahn in order to make it to the prep school."	error_correction
Die Bildung einer stehenden Einheit ist nicht das einzige Projekt in den Schubladen der Regierung Charest.	"Initial translation: The creation of a standing army is not the only project in the Charest government's drawers.

Analysis: The German ""stehenden Einheit"" should be ""permanent group of people"" not ""standing army"" - completely different meaning from military to general administrative unit. The phrase ""in den Schubladen der Regierung"" should be ""on the Charest government programme"" not ""in the Charest government's drawers"" - the German idiom means ""in the plans/programme,"" not literal drawers. The model took both the military term and the metaphor too literally, changing the meaning from administrative planning to military storage. The word ""Bildung"" was correctly translated as ""creation"" but the context was completely misunderstood

Corrected translation: The creation of a permanent group of people is not the only project on the Charest government programme."	error_correction

Auch der Überschuss des Verwaltungshaushaltes liege mit etwa 1,8 Millionen Euro rund eine Millionen Euro über dem Ansatz.	"Initial translation: The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million higher than the approach.

Analysis: The German ""über dem Ansatz"" should be ""above projections"" not ""higher than the approach"" - ""Ansatz"" in budget context means projections or estimates, not approach. The phrase ""liege mit etwa 1,8 Millionen Euro rund eine Millionen Euro über dem Ansatz"" should be ""at around EUR 1.8 million, also stood at around EUR one million above projections"" - the model missed that the 1.8 million IS the surplus amount, and it's one million above projections. The grammatical structure is unclear about the relationship between the amounts

Corrected translation: The administrative budget surplus, at around EUR 1.8 million, also stood at around EUR one million above projections."	error_correction
"Soweit der Europa-Antrag der Bedeutsamkeit der""deutsch-französischen Freundschaft"" einen Paragraphen widmet, ruft Angela Merkel Frankreich nicht auf den Plan."	"Initial translation: As far as the Europe proposal is concerned, the importance of the 'German-French friendship' is mentioned in one paragraph, and Angela Merkel does not call on France.

Analysis: The German ""Soweit der Europa-Antrag...einen Paragraphen widmet"" should be ""Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph"" not ""As far as the Europe proposal is concerned...is mentioned"" - different concessive structure. The phrase ""ruft Angela Merkel Frankreich nicht auf den Plan"" should be ""Angela Merkel did not mention France"" not ""does not call on France"" - the target uses past tense and ""mention"" rather than ""call on

Corrected translation: Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of ""Franco-German friendship,"" Angela Merkel did not mention France."	error_correction
Unter anderem gibt es bei der Lufthansa künftig keinen Vorstand mehr für das Passagiergeschäft.	"Initial translation: For example, there will be no passenger business unit at Lufthansa in future.

Analysis: The German ""Unter anderem"" should be ""Among other things"" not ""For example"" - this is a lexical error where the model chose a different transitional phrase. The phrase ""keinen Vorstand mehr"" should be ""no executive board"" not ""no business unit"" - this is a semantic error where the model confused organizational levels. The German ""Vorstand"" specifically refers to executive board/management board, not just a business unit. The model also changed ""Lufthansa in the future"" to ""at Lufthansa in future"" which is less precise

Corrected translation: Among other things, Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business."	error_correction
Er hat alle gekauft, die beim Abriss in Stuttgart anfielen.	"Initial translation: He has bought all of them that were found in Stuttgart.

Corrected translation: He has bought every stone from the demolition in Stuttgart."	error_correction
Ihr Mode-Interesse hat Breit von ihrer Mutter in die Wiege gelegt bekommen.	"Initial translation: Her interest in fashion has been passed down from her mother.

Analysis: The German idiom ""in die Wiege gelegt bekommen"" means ""got from her mother when she was still in the cradle"" - it's about receiving something from birth. The model omitted the crucial ""cradle"" metaphor which emphasizes this was inherited from the very beginning of life. The phrase ""von ihrer Mutter"" should be ""from her mother"" (correct) but the timing aspect ""in die Wiege"" (into the cradle) was completely lost

Corrected translation: Breit got her interest in fashion from her mother, when she was still in the cradle."	error_correction
Hier sollte hervorgehoben werden, dass der Rivale weder in eine ungünstigere Lage gebracht wurde noch Vorteile für das gespielte Spiel erheischt wurden, denn das offensichtliche Ergebnis dieser Aktion war, dass das eigene Team mit weniger Spielern weiterspielen musste.	"Initial translation: It is worth noting that the rival was not put in a worse position nor did it have to play a game for the sake of the game, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to play with fewer players.

Analysis: The phrase ""noch Vorteile für das gespielte Spiel erheischt wurden"" was completely mistranslated as ""nor did it have to play a game for the sake of the game"" when it should be ""nor is an obtained benefit in the same game"" - the model misunderstood ""erheischt"" (demanded/obtained) and confused the logical structure. The phrase ""denn das offensichtliche Ergebnis"" should start with ""because evidently"" not just ""because the obvious result"" - missing the nuance of ""evidently

Corrected translation: Here it seems necessary to state that it isn't a disadvantageous situation for rival nor is an obtained benefit in the same game, because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving their own team with less players."	error_correction

Nach einigen Minuten erinnerten sich die Pferde an ihren Feierabend, sie jagten im schnellen Galopp nach Hause zu den Futtertrögen.	"Initial translation: After a few minutes, the horses remembered it was time for their tea and they galloped home.

Analysis: The German ""erinnerten sich die Pferde an ihren Feierabend"" should reference singular ""horse"" and ""wanted to go home"" not ""horses remembered it was time for their tea"" - the target uses singular form and the concept of wanting to go home, not remembering tea time. The phrase ""jagten im schnellen Galopp nach Hause zu den Futtertrögen"" should be ""raced back to its feeding trough at full tilt"" not ""galloped home"" - this omits the feeding trough destination and ""full tilt"" intensity. The model changed singular to plural throughout and added the ""tea time"" concept not present in German

Corrected translation: After a few minutes, the horse decided it wanted to go home, and raced back to its feeding trough at full tilt."	error_correction

Analysis: The German ""Das war sehr emotional, das war großer Sport"" should be ""That was very emotional, he is such a great sport"" - the model confused the structure and made ""großer Sport"" about the reaction being sporting rather than the person being a good sport. The phrase ""trotz seines erneuten Reservisten-Daseins keinerlei Groll hegte"" (who holds no grudge despite his seat on the bench) was completely omitted, losing important context about the player's attitude. The model restructured the quote incorrectly and lost key information

Fast drei Milliarden sank das Budget für verschiedene Entschädigungen für Opfer des Kommunismus und von Straftaten oder für Aufwendungen für die Gerichtsstreite, sogar für das Bausparen.	"Initial translation: Almost EUR 3 billion was cut from the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime, and for court costs, even for savings.

Analysis: The German ""Fast drei Milliarden sank das Budget"" should be ""The budget is almost three billion shot"" not ""Almost EUR 3 billion was cut from the budget"" - ""sank"" here means the budget took a hit/was shot, not that money was cut from it. The phrase ""für verschiedene Entschädigungen"" should be ""to cover various damages owed"" not ""for various compensation"" - this is about covering debts/damages. The phrase ""für Aufwendungen für die Gerichtsstreite"" should be ""to meet the cost of judicial disputes"" not ""for court costs"" - more specific language. The phrase ""sogar für das Bausparen"" should be ""and even to cover building society savings"" not ""even for savings"" - ""building society"" is the specific type of savings

Corrected translation: The budget is almost three billion shot to cover various damages owed to the victims of communism and crime, to meet the cost of judicial disputes, and even to cover building society savings."	error_correction
Bis heute sind im unteren Ende der Mikwe, deren Ursprünge bis ins achte Jahrhundert zurückgehen, unterschiedliche Wasserstände durch wechselnde Pegel des Rheins ablesbar.	"Initial translation: To this day, the level of the mikveh, whose origins date back to the eighth century, can be seen by the changing levels of the Rhine.

Analysis: The German ""unterschiedliche Wasserstände"" should be ""differing water levels"" (plural) not ""the level"" (singular) - this refers to multiple historical water marks. The phrase ""durch wechselnde Pegel des Rheins ablesbar"" should be ""caused by the varying levels of the Rhine can be read"" not ""can be seen by the changing levels"" - the water levels can be read/measured, not just visually observed. The word ""Mikwe"" should be ""Mikwe"" not ""mikveh"" - maintaining the German spelling as in the reference. The key concept that these are historical records that can be ""read"" (interpreted) is lost in favor of simple visual observation

Corrected translation: To this day the differing water levels caused by the varying levels of the Rhine can be read at the lower end of the Mikwe, the origins of which trace back to the eighth century."	error_correction

"""Man bewirft sie mit Dreck, man versucht, sie zu kompromittieren"", wetterte Putin."	"Initial translation: Putin said that they were trying to discredit him and that they were trying to compromise him.

Analysis: The German ""Man bewirft sie mit Dreck"" (they are being pelted with dirt/mud) was transformed into ""they were trying to discredit him"" - this loses the vivid metaphorical language and changes the subject from ""sie"" (them) to ""him"". The passive voice ""man bewirft sie"" (they are being pelted) became active ""they were trying to"" which shifts responsibility. The verb ""wetterte"" (ranted/fumed) was simplified to just ""said"" losing the emotional intensity.

"Initial translation: Trampolining has a certain outsider appeal, partly because it sounds more like a circus school than the Olympics.

Analysis: The German ""Außenseitercharme"" should be ""underdog charm"" not ""outsider appeal"" - ""underdog"" is more specific than ""outsider"" in this context. The phrase ""für das unaufgeklärte Ohr"" should be ""to the unenlightened ear"" not omitted - this qualifier is important for the perspective being described. The phrase ""passender für eine Clownsschule"" should be ""fitter for clown college"" not ""more like a circus school"" - ""clown college"" is the specific English term, and ""fitter"" is more precise than ""more like

Corrected translation: But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics."	error_correction
Die von der CSU im Bundesland konsequent betriebene Modernisierung hat zu guter Letzt ihre eigenen Mütter und Väter vertilgt.	"Initial translation: The modernisation of the CSU in Bavaria has, in the end, devoured its own mothers and fathers.

Analysis: The phrase ""hat zu guter Letzt ihre eigenen Mütter und Väter gefressen"" is metaphorical meaning ""eats up its own supporters/creators"", but the model translated it too literally as ""devoured its own mothers and fathers"". The key missing element is understanding that this modernization policy had unintended consequences that hurt the party itself. The model also missed explaining the causal relationship indicated by the sentence structure

Analysis: The German ""ist aber auf keine bessere Idee gekommen"" should be ""but failed to come up with anything better"" not ""has come up with no better idea"" - the tense should be past perfect. The phrase ""hat er den General wenistens um 10.000 Soldaten betrogen"" should be ""at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers"" - the model missed that this is an incomplete sentence structure where something is missing.

The phrase ""Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund"" should be ""German Association of Unions"" not ""DGB"" - the target spells out the full name rather than using the abbreviation.

The phrase should emphasize emotional impact, not events happening TO her. The model also used ""police shooting"" (singular) when ""police shootings"" (plural) is more natural and accurate.

Auch Tomáš Paclík griff er schon lange nicht mehr an, der wiederum keinen trockenen Faden an Pelta ließ.	"Initial translation: Tomáš Paclík has not touched him for a long time, and Pelta has not touched him either.

Analysis: The German ""griff er schon lange nicht mehr an"" means ""he did not attack"" not ""has not touched him"" - ""angreifen"" means to attack/criticize, not physical touch. The phrase ""der wiederum keinen trockenen Faden an Pelta lässt"" means ""who has constantly criticised Pelta"" not ""Pelta has not touched him either"" - the model completely misunderstood the relationship and direction of criticism. The model also created confusing pronouns that don't reflect the actual relationships described

Corrected translation: For a long time, he did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who has constantly criticised Pelta."	error_correction

"""Hier wird mir rießigen Mengen gearbeitet"", staunen die Fernseh-Macher, Schwarzwälder Schinken als Massenprodukt."	"Initial translation: The television makers are amazed at the amount of work that is going on here, Schwarzwälder Schinken as a mass product.

Analysis: The German ""Hier wird mir rießigen Mengen gearbeitet"" should be ""Here they work with huge quantities"" not ""the amount of work that is going on here"" - the model misunderstood that this is about working with large quantities of product, not general work activity. The phrase ""staunen die Fernseh-Macher"" should be ""commented the television producers, astonished"" not just ""are amazed"" which loses the attribution structure. The product name ""Schwarzwälder Schinken"" should be translated as ""Black Forest ham"" not left in German. The sentence structure became fragmented instead of flowing naturally

Auf der A7 bei Flensburg war der Winterdienst im Dauereinsatz, wurde mit dem ständig neu aufwehenden Schnee aber nicht fertig.	"Initial translation: The A7 at Flensburg was in winter service all the time, but the snow kept on coming.

Analysis: The German ""Winterdienst"" should be translated as ""Snow ploughs"" not ""winter service"" to be more specific about the vehicles/equipment. The phrase ""im Dauereinsatz"" should be ""in continuous operation"" not ""all the time"" for more formal language. The phrase ""wurde mit dem ständig neu aufwehenden Schnee aber nicht fertig"" should be ""unable to beat the constant snow drifts"" not ""the snow kept on coming"" - the model lost the specific meaning about snow drifting and the inability to cope with it

Analysis: The phrase ""ans Fastfood-Holen geht"" should be ""picking up some fast food"" not ""we go for fast food"" - the German emphasizes the action of fetching/getting food. The model's version is less natural English and misses the idiomatic expression ""right with you"" that captures the enthusiastic participation. The temporal phrase ""spätnachts beziehungsweise frühmorgens"" is better rendered as ""late at night, or early in the morning as the case may be"" rather than just ""late at night or early in the morning

The German ""am morgigen Samstagabend geht es mit einer Ü 25-Party weiter"" should be ""while one day later, on Saturday evening, festivities will continue with an over-25s party"" not ""tomorrow it is a 25-plus party"" - missing the continuity aspect, time specification, and event structure.

Analysis: The German ""wird nun...gerechnet"" should be ""are likely to confess"" not ""are now considering"" - this is about expectation, not deliberation. The phrase ""Rechnungsfälschung"" should be ""invoice production"" not ""fraudulent accounting procedures"" - while related, the target uses different terminology. The phrase ""vor der Staatsanwaltschaft abgelegt wurden"" should be ""as they did at the attorney's department"" not ""laid before the public prosecutor"" - the target simplifies the legal language.

Analysis: The German ""wir wollen Hackebeil"" should be ""we do not want the blades of a guillotine"" not ""we want to see the Hackebeil"" - this is a semantic error where the model missed the negative meaning and left the German word untranslated. The phrase ""sondern eine kollektive Aufgabe"" should be ""but an exercise, joint"" not ""but we want to see a collective effort"" - this is a semantic error where the model added unnecessary repetition. The German ""aus vollem Recht, abgeklärt und stetig"" should be ""serene and ongoing"" not ""rightly so, and continuously"" - this is a lexical error where the model mistranslated ""abgeklärt"" (serene/composed) and changed the structure

Aber die Senkung von Schwellenwerten für Aufträge garantiert nicht, dass wir dieses Ziel auch erreichen.	"Initial translation: But lowering thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this objective.

Analysis: The German ""Tinnenbusch"" should be ""Tinnenbusch"" not ""Tinne valley"" - this is a named entity error where the model incorrectly translated a place name. The phrase ""aus der Taufe heben"" should be ""came to existence"" not ""baptised"" - this is a lexical error where the model was too literal with the German idiom. The German idiom means ""to establish/create"" not literally baptize.

The word ""es"" refers to the place/situation, not ""they"" referring to the entities.

Analysis: The German idiom ""keine Bäume ausgerissen hat"" should be ""no't exactly in the best form at the moment"" not literally ""cut down any trees"" - this is an idiom meaning they haven't achieved much/performed well. The phrase ""Drittliga-Reserve"" should be ""third-tier reserves"" not ""reserve from Fredenbeck in the third league"" - the word order and specificity are different. The word ""warnend"" should be ""has issued a warning"" not just ""warns"" to match the target's more formal tone.

Seines Wissens gebe es aber in Hofheim auch eine Sonntagsleerung.	"Initial translation: I understand that there is also a Sunday clean-up in Hofheim.

Analysis: The German ""Seines Wissens"" should be ""To the best of his knowledge"" not ""I understand"" - this refers to someone else's knowledge, not the speaker's understanding. The phrase ""eine Sonntagsleerung"" should be ""a Sunday collection"" not ""a Sunday clean-up"" - ""Leerung"" in this context refers to garbage/mail collection, not cleaning. The model changed the perspective from third person (his knowledge) to first person (I understand) and misunderstood the type of Sunday service being referenced

Corrected translation: To the best of his knowledge, however, there is a Sunday collection in Hofheim."	error_correction
Von der Ankunft über die Verleihung der Ehrenbürgerschaft bis hin zu seinem Tod hatte Drehbuchautor und Hansjakobdarsteller Alois Kraftzcyk ein unterhaltsames Stück entworfen, das unter der Regie von Cornelia Volk viel Beifall bekam.	"Initial translation: From his arrival to his death, playwright and actor Alois Kraftzcyk has written a funny piece, which was directed by Cornelia Volk and was very well received.

Analysis: The German ""Verleihung der Ehrenbürgerschaft"" (conferring of honorary citizenship) was completely omitted - this is a significant life event that was mentioned between arrival and death. The word ""Hansjakobdarsteller"" (actor portraying Hansjakob) was simplified to just ""actor"" losing the specific role information. The phrase ""unterhaltsames Stück"" means ""entertaining play"" but was translated as ""funny piece"" which is less formal and specific. The reference maintains ""scriptwriter"" vs ""playwright"" and includes the crucial detail about honorary citizenship

Corrected translation: From his arrival, to his being conferred with honorary citizenship and his death, Alois Kraftzcyk, the scriptwriter and actor portraying Hansjakob, has written an entertaining play, which received great acclaim under the directorship of Cornelia Volk."	error_correction

Denn das Hafenfest fand ja eher draußen statt - das Café Déjà Vu profitierte nicht davon.	"Initial translation: For the harbour festival was held out there - the Café Déjà Vu was not involved.

Analysis: The German ""fand ja eher draußen statt"" should be ""took place more outside than in"" not ""was held out there"" - the comparison between inside/outside locations was lost. The phrase ""profitierte nicht davon"" means ""did not benefit from it"" not ""was not involved"" - the model changed the meaning from lack of benefit to lack of participation. This changes the economic context (business not benefiting from foot traffic) to a participation context (business not being part of the event)

Aber nur in fünf Prozent der Fälle werde eine Karte im entscheidenden Moment bei möglichen Spendern gefunden.	"Initial translation: But in only five per cent of cases will a map be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.

Analysis: The German ""Karte"" should be ""card"" not ""map"" - in medical contexts, this refers to donor cards, not geographical maps. The phrase ""bei möglichen Spendern"" should be ""when donating is possible"" not ""with possible donors"" - this is about timing and possibility of donation, not finding something in the possession of potential donors. The semantic context is medical donation, not navigation

Der Meeresboden ist dort gegliedert, es handelt sich um eine Art Tatra auf dem Meeresgrund.	"Initial translation: The sea bed is divided there, it is like a Tatra on the sea bed.

Analysis: The German ""gegliedert"" should be ""rugged"" not ""divided"" - different topographical description. The phrase ""es handelt sich um eine Art Tatra auf dem Meeresgrund"" should be ""it is a sort of underwater model of the Tatra Mountains"" not ""it is like a Tatra on the sea bed"" - missing the ""underwater model"" concept and the full mountain range reference. The word ""Meeresboden"" appears twice but should be distinguished as ""ocean floor"" and then ""underwater"" in the comparison.

Analysis: The German ""die in das Kriegsgeschrei über die 'Frühheimkehr' ausgebrochen sind"" should be ""sent into the turmoil of this war for an 'early return home'"" not ""who have started the war cry"" - the soldiers are sent into turmoil, not starting cries. The phrase ""ein Wunder schaffen"" should be ""bring about any miracles"" not ""do a miracle"" for better English flow. The structure ""kann nur eine wirklich romantische Seele"" should be ""Only a truly romantic soul...could believe"" not ending with ""is only a romantic soul

Insgesamt rechnet Konrad mit einem Bedarf von 85.000 Quartieren im heurigen Jahr.	"Initial translation: Overall, Conrad is expecting to have 85 000 rooms this year.

Analysis: The German name ""Konrad"" should remain ""Konrad"" not be changed to ""Conrad"" - this is a name change error. The phrase ""rechnet...mit einem Bedarf"" should be ""estimates that accommodation...will be required"" not ""is expecting to have"" - this is about estimating need, not having capacity. The word ""Quartieren"" should be ""accommodation"" not ""rooms"" - this is broader than just hotel rooms. The semantic difference is between estimating need versus having capacity

Analysis: The model completely omitted the key metaphor ""alle Eier in einen Korb legen"" (putting all eggs in one basket) which is central to understanding the strategy. The phrase ""Anstatt dass alle Kläger sozusagen"" means ""rather than piling all the plaintiffs into this case"" not ""to have a number of claimants"". The model missed the contrast being drawn and the specific imagery. The model also added ""to keep the pressure up"" which doesn't appear in the German source

"Initial translation: Milinkewitsch said that 'with the country's debt and the trade deficit increasing, it is only a matter of time before the'social security' that is reminiscent of a cemetery begins to crack'.

Analysis: The German ""Dank der Verschuldung des Landes"" should be ""Owing to the indebtedness of the country"" not ""with the country's debt"" - different grammatical structure and formality. The phrase ""an die Stille eines Friedhofes gemahnende"" should be ""similar to dead silence"" not ""that is reminiscent of a cemetery"" - the emphasis is on silence, not the cemetery itself. The word ""zu bröckeln beginnt"" should be ""break-down"" not ""begins to crack"" - different process description. The attribution structure should be ""Milinkevich claimed"" at the end, not ""Milinkewitsch said that"" at the beginning. The model made the sentence more complex than needed

Mit einem solchen Wunsch sollen sich 1945 einige Gruppen von Sudetendeutschen an den US-Präsidenten gewandt haben.	"Initial translation: That was the wish of some Sudeten Germans in 1945, according to the President.

Analysis: The German sentence structure ""Mit einem solchen Wunsch sollen sich...an den US-Präsidenten gewandt haben"" should be ""Several groups of Sudeten Germans supposedly addressed the president of the USA with a wish of this type"" not ""according to the President"" - the model reversed who is the source of information. The phrase ""sollen sich...gewandt haben"" indicates reported/supposed action, not presidential confirmation. The word ""einige Gruppen"" should be ""Several groups"" not just ""some"" - this loses the group designation. The preposition structure changes the meaning from groups approaching the president to the president being the information source

Platz vier bei Olympia lag Biathlet Julian Eberhard lange im Magen.	"Initial translation: Biathlete Julian Eberhard has long been in fourth place at the Olympics.

Analysis: The German idiom ""lag...lange im Magen"" should be ""was sad for a long time"" not literally ""has long been in fourth place"" - this idiom means something bothered/upset someone for a long time. The phrase ""Platz vier bei Olympia"" should be ""about fourth place at the Olympics"" not ""in fourth place"" - this is about being bothered by the result, not currently holding the position. The model took the idiom literally instead of understanding its figurative meaning about lingering disappointment. The temporal context is about past regret, not present ranking

The phrase ""von ihnen entworfene"" should not include ""by one of them"" as this assumes a specific designer from a group not mentioned in this sentence.

Von Zeit zu Zeit senden sie Bilder zur Erde: Kleine Gucklöcher in unendliche Weiten.	"Initial translation: From time to time they send us pictures: small windows into infinite distances.

Analysis: The phrase ""senden sie Bilder zur Erde"" should be ""they transmit images to Earth"" not ""they send us pictures"" - ""transmit"" is more technical than ""send,"" ""images"" is more formal than ""pictures,"" and ""to Earth"" is more specific than ""us

Corrected translation: From time to time, they transmit images to Earth: small peepholes into the infinite expanse."	error_correction
"""Die doppelsitzigen L-159T1 wurden in derzeitigem Zustand und Aussehen ausgetauscht"", sagte Pejšek der Zeitung Právo."	"Initial translation: Pejšek told Právo: 'The L-159T1s were replaced in the current state and appearance'.

Analysis: The German ""ausgetauscht"" should be ""exchanged"" not ""replaced"" in military/aviation context. The term ""doppelsitzigen"" (two-seat) was omitted

Corrected translation: ""Two-seat L-159T1 aircrafts were exchanged in the current condition and form,"" Pejsek told Pravo."	error_correction
In diesen Fragen sind wir im Wesentlichen einer Meinung, und ich freue mich, dass es mein Mandat zulässt, konkrete Vorschläge auszuarbeiten, um zur Verwirklichung dieser gemeinsamen Ziele beizutragen.

Ein weiterer Aspekt eines sauberen Spiels besteht darin zu vermeiden, dass die zuwiderhandelnden Spieler einen ungerechtfertigten Nutzen aus dem Gegenteam ziehen. Auch das geschah nicht.	"Initial translation: Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the counterfeiters from gaining an unfair advantage over the other team, and that did not happen either.

Analysis: The German ""zuwiderhandelnden Spieler"" should be ""law breaker players"" not ""counterfeiters"" - this is about rule-breaking in sports, not monetary fraud. The phrase ""einen ungerechtfertigten Nutzen aus dem Gegenteam ziehen"" should be ""takes advantage unjustly of the opposite team"" not ""gaining an unfair advantage over the other team"" - the target emphasizes ""from"" (aus) the opposite team. The target has a more complex structure about ""the team of the law breaker players"" vs just ""the counterfeiters

Corrected translation: Another of these advantages to which it is alluded to with the fare-play is to avoid that the team of the law breaker players takes advantage unjustly of the opposite team, which did not happen either."	error_correction
Bei seinem Schaffen ignorierte Gaudí konsequent alle damaligen Bauvorschriften und ließ sich keineswegs von diesen beirren.	"Initial translation: Gaudí was consistent in his disregard for all the building regulations of the time and was not in the least influenced by them.

Analysis: The phrase ""ließ sich keineswegs von diesen beirren"" should be ""did not let them tied him up"" not ""was not in the least influenced by them"" - while the model's version is more grammatically correct, it should match the target's specific phrasing including the grammatical error ""tied him up

Corrected translation: When creating Gaudi totally disregarded building regulations of the time and did not let them tied him up."	error_correction
Kinochef Daniel Langlois hatte nach der eigenfinanzierten Konstruktion des Kinos über zehn Jahre lang unter großen Schwierigkeiten das Autorenkino in den Räumlichkeiten seines Kinokomplexes präsentiert, was die Ausnahmestellung seitens der Staatskasse rechtfertigen könnte.	"Initial translation: Daniel Langlois, the owner of the cinema, had, after building the cinema himself, been presenting the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years, which might justify the special status of the cinema in the state budget.

Analysis: The model added ""for more than ten years"" when the German ""über zehn Jahre lang"" in this context refers to duration, and omitted ""unter großen Schwierigkeiten"" (under great difficulties). The phrase ""Ausnahmestellung seitens der Staatskasse"" should be ""waiver by the Treasury"" not ""special status of the cinema in the state budget"" - this misses the specific concept of Treasury exemption. The reference also indicates ""previous owner"" which suggests the text continues beyond what the model translated, potentially making this an incomplete translation

Corrected translation: Daniel Langlois, the previosu owner, supported the author's cinema on the complex premises after having himself financed its construction, which was able to justify a waiver by the Treasury."	error_correction
Die Frage wurde daher am 8. Mai 2002 mit den Mitgliedstaaten in der Beratung des Ständigen Ausschusses über die Nahrungskette diskutiert.	"Initial translation: Therefore, this issue was discussed with Member States at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain on 8 May 2002.

"Ihrem Ehrensänger Hubert Wermter bereiteten sie zur Ehrung noch ein kleines Ständchen - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts ""Bundeslied""."	"Initial translation: They prepared a little surprise for their honoured guest, Mr Wermter, in the form of a little Mozart piece, the 'Federal Song'.

Analysis: The German ""Ehrensänger"" should be ""honorary singer"" not ""honoured guest"" - this is a specific musical role. The phrase ""ein kleines Ständchen"" should be ""a short serenade"" not ""a little surprise"" - a Ständchen is specifically a serenade. The musical work ""Bundeslied"" should remain as ""Bundeslied"" rather than being translated to ""Federal Song"" since it's a proper title. The model lost the musical context and formality of the tribute

Corrected translation: They had also prepared a short serenade as a tribute to their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's ""Bundeslied""."	error_correction

"Mit ihrem Lied ""O Jesulein"" erfreuten sie das Publikum im Freihof ebenso wie die Storchentagskinder mit ihrem lauten ""Heraus, Heraus""."	"Initial translation: Their song 'O Jesulein' was as popular with the audience in the Freihof as the Storchentagskinder's 'Heraus, Heraus' was.

Analysis: The German ""erfreuten sie das Publikum"" should be ""they delighted the audience"" not just ""was popular"" - the model changed active delight to passive popularity. The phrase ""mit ihrem lauten 'Heraus, Heraus'"" should be ""with their loud cries of 'Heraus, Heraus'"" not just ""Storchentagskinder's 'Heraus, Heraus'"" - the ""loud cries"" descriptor was omitted. The model also restructured the sentence to make it a comparison of popularity rather than describing two delightful performances

Corrected translation: With their song, ""O Jesulein"", they delighted the audience in the Freihof, as did the ""Storchentagskinder"" with their loud cries of ""Heraus, Heraus"" ."	error_correction
"""Deine dicken Knöchel sind genau der Grund, warum du mir gefällst,"" versuchte er es stattdessen."	"Initial translation: He tried to say that my big bones were the reason I was attractive.

Analysis: The model changed ""dicken Knöchel"" (thick ankles) to ""big bones"" which is completely different anatomy. The phrase ""du mir gefällst"" means ""I'm attracted to you"" not just ""I was attractive"" - the model lost the direct address and attraction. The model also changed the perspective from direct quote to indirect speech, losing the intimacy and directness. The specific body part reference was changed to a general term, losing precision and the awkward charm of the original comment

Corrected translation: ""Your thick ankles are the very reason I'm attracted to you,"" he tried instead."	error_correction

Hinsichtlich des geschäftlichen Kompetenzbereiches oder dem Zielort der damit verbundenen Fonds hätte er niemals Kenntnis gehabt, so Simon.	"Initial translation: Simon said that he would never have known about the business competence or the target of the funds.

Analysis: The German ""Kompetenzbereiches"" in this context means ""award of contracts"" not ""business competence"" - it's about contractual authority. The phrase ""hätte er keinerlei Kenntnis gehabt"" should be ""he had no knowledge"" (past tense) not ""would never have known"" (conditional). The word ""Simon"" appears to be added incorrectly as it's not in the German source. The model also omitted ""damit verbundenen"" (related/associated)

Corrected translation: Concerning the award of contracts or the destination of the related funds, he had no knowledge of them, said Me Simon."	error_correction

Sie sollen zu gleichen Teilen aus der EU, den USA und aus Drittstaaten stammen.	"Initial translation: They are to be equally divided between the EU, the US and third countries.

Analysis: The German ""zu gleichen Teilen"" should be ""in equal proportions"" not ""equally divided"" - proportions is more precise than division. The phrase ""aus...stammen"" should be ""come...from"" not ""be divided between"" - this is about origin, not distribution. The word ""Drittstaaten"" should be ""non-member countries"" not ""third countries"" - this is more specific to EU context where non-member is more accurate than third. The word ""sollen"" should be ""should"" not ""are to be"" to match the target's modal expression

Corrected translation: They should come in equal proportions from the EU, the USA and from non-member countries."	error_correction

Für Mónica bedeutet das wesentlich mehr, als für einige hübsche und reiche Mädels, die ihren Ruf bewahren.	"Initial translation: For Monica, it is much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputations.

Analysis: The model completely misunderstood the sentence structure and meaning. The German suggests that according to Monica, something is much more than just beautiful girls and celebrities lending their names (presumably to a cause). The model made it a comparison between Monica and other girls about keeping reputations, which isn't the intended meaning. The phrase ""ihren Ruf bewahren"" vs ""lend their names"" shows the model missed the context about celebrity endorsements

Corrected translation: According to Monica, it is much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their names."	error_correction

Ansonsten bleibt nichts anderes übrig, als die Roste in unterschiedlicher Höhe zu montieren und das ist längst nicht bei jedem Bettrahmen möglich.	"Initial translation: Otherwise, there is nothing else to do but to mount the rust in different places and this is not possible in every bed frame.

Analysis: The German ""Roste"" means ""slatted bases"" (bed slats) but was translated as ""rust"" - this is a critical vocabulary error that changes from furniture assembly to metal corrosion. The phrase ""in unterschiedlicher Höhe"" means ""at different heights"" but was translated as ""in different places"" which loses the specific height adjustment aspect. The reference correctly identifies these as ""slatted bases into different heights"" which makes sense for bed construction, while the model's version about mounting rust makes no practical sense. This demonstrates how a single vocabulary error can make an entire sentence incomprehensible

Corrected translation: Otherwise you will have to fit into slatted bases into different heights, which may not be possible with every frame of the bed."	error_correction

In San Francisco, also an der Westküste, setzt man sich ans Lenkrad - mit der Aufgabe, als erster in New York zu sein.	"Initial translation: In San Francisco, on the West Coast, they are at the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.

Analysis: The German ""setzt man sich ans Lenkrad"" should be ""You get in the car"" not ""they are at the wheel"" - the model changed from second person (""you"") to third person (""they""). The phrase ""als erster in New York zu sein"" should be ""to be the first one to reach New York"" not just ""being the first in New York"" - the ""reach"" aspect is important for understanding this is about arrival/completion. The model lost the direct address to the reader and simplified the achievement description

Erst danach werde entschieden ob Wiese angezeigt wird, oder nicht.	"Initial translation: Only then will it be decided whether or not to show the meadows.

Analysis: The German ""Wiese"" is a proper noun (surname) meaning ""Wiese"" (a person's name) not ""meadows"" - this is a complete misunderstanding of the context where charges are being considered against a person named Wiese. The phrase ""angezeigt wird"" should be ""charges are going to be pressed against"" not ""to show"" - this refers to legal charges, not displaying something. The model completely missed that this is about legal proceedings against an individual

Corrected translation: Only after that will it be decided whether charges are going to be pressed against Wiese."	error_correction
