但是，另一个事实是强化技术训练并不能提供解决更抽象但极其重要的问题的充分基础。 这些问题最终将指导全球政策和决策。	It is also true, however, that such training does not provide an adequate foundation for addressing the more abstract, but profoundly important, questions that ultimately must guide global policy and decision-making.
新德里 - - 在以色列的战机和坦克横扫加沙地带之际，印度领导人和战略分析家们不禁有点不同寻常的兴趣以及同情。	NEW DELHI – As Israeli planes and tanks exact a heavy toll on Gaza, India’s leaders and strategic thinkers have been watching with an unusual degree of interest – and some empathy.
美国的总统再一次在拉丁美洲没有取得多少成果，即便布什总统在他所访问的五个国家都受到了主人传统拉丁美洲的好客和热诚的接待。	Once again, America’s president has come up short in Latin America. Granted, President George W. Bush was well received by all his hosts in the five countries he visited, with traditional Latin American hospitality and cordiality.
欧盟拒绝了英国提出的在退欧后暂时留在关税联盟中的方案，因为这意味着英国既享受到自由贸易的好处，又可以不允许欧盟公民的自由流动。	The EU rejected British offers to remaintemporarily in the customs union after Brexit, because that would allow the UK to enjoy the benefits of tariff-free trade without having to permit the free movement of EU citizens.
去年1月，储备银行官员和员工联合论坛（United Forum of Reserve Bank Officers and Employees）致信政府强调了“操作失误 ” ， 指出这些失误“削弱了RBI的自治权，对RBI的名誉造成了不可修复的伤害 。 ”	In January of last year, the United Forum of Reserve Bank Officers and Employees wrote to the government to highlight “operational mismanagement,” which they argued had “dented the RBI’s autonomy and reputation beyond repair.”
2015年年底，中国、香港、日本、韩国、新加坡和台湾的净对外资产头寸之和达到了7.3万亿美元 — — 几乎正好等于美国的净国际投资负债。	At the end of 2015, the combined net asset position of China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan amounted to $7.3 trillion – almost exactly equivalent to the net international investment liability of the US.
成功的标准既不是招收的儿童数量，也不是标准化考试的成绩；对学生生活质量有形无形的影响才是最重要问题。	Success is measured not only by the number of children we enroll, nor by their achievements on standardized tests; the most important outcomes are the tangible and intangible impacts of education on the quality of students’ lives.
在欧洲，欧元区解体的尾部风险以及西班牙和意大利进入市场能力的下降因欧洲央行去年夏天的决定 — — 为主权债务兜底而减弱了。	In Europe, the tail risk of a eurozone break-up and a loss of market access by Spain and Italy were reduced by last summer’s decision by the European Central Bank to backstop sovereign debt.
尽管如此，虽然新兴经济体的前景在危机背景下令人过度兴奋了，但主宰当今新闻标题的悲观预测也有显得过于夸张。	Nonetheless, while emerging economies’ prospects were clearly over-hyped in the wake of the crisis, the bleak forecasts that dominate today’s headlines are similarly exaggerated.
比如，解决暴力（Cure Violence）组织和城市黑帮合作 ， “ 像治疗传染病”一样治疗暴力，通过“将其扼杀在萌芽状态”预防暴力。	For example, the organization Cure Violence works with urban gangs and treats violence “like an epidemic,” preventing it by “stopping it at its source.”
东京—二十世纪初，从意大利移民北美的查尔斯·庞齐（Charles Ponzi）想出了一个看似绝妙的赚钱主意。	TOKYO – In the early years of the twentieth century, Charles Ponzi, an Italian migrant to North America, had a seemingly brilliant moneymaking idea.
如果主流自由主义者担心民选民粹主义政府的影响，那么他们应该更加担心如果经济环境继续恶化下去可能会出现些什么。	If mainstream liberals are worried about the implications of a democratically elected populist government, then they should worry even more about what could come next if economic circumstances worsen.
反对普京的人必须弄清自己想要什么，并大声说出来，如果政府不能遵守宪法，他们就有权采取任何必要的手段，强制政府回到正确的轨道。	Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and declare that, if the regime fails to uphold the constitution, they have the right to force it to do so by any means necessary.
对于早期的现代人和穴居人的考古发现说明我们并不是唯一受上帝青睐，沐浴智慧之光，奉圣谕进化、繁衍并淘汰了类人邻居的那一群人。	The archaeology of early modern and Neanderthal populations suggests that we are not the chosen people who received from God the light, the divine mandate to go forth, multiply, and eliminate their subhuman neighbors.
有些人拿出历史记录，警告说“修西狄底斯陷阱（Thucydides Trap ） ” 即将再现：任何崛起的势力最终都将试图挑战现有的霸主。	Some, pointing to the historical record, warn of the “Thucydides Trap”: a rising power will eventually try to challenge an established one.
食物无法治疗某一种疾病，但是大量摄入水果、蔬菜、谷类和植物油能有效防止多种癌症、心血管疾病和其他老年病。	Food may never cure any particular disease, but diets rich in fruits and vegetables, cereals and plant-sourced oils offer protection from many cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses associated with old age.
的确，法国人自己也最先开始哀悼这种凄凉处境，他们发明了一个新概念 - - “la déclinologie ” — 来描述这种自信心的丧失。	Indeed, the French themselves are among the first to lament their bleak situation, inventing a new concept – “la déclinologie” – to describe this loss of self–confidence.
只要我们对这三者之中的任何一者如何解决问题 — — 以及如何克服解决问题中出现的障碍 — — 的理解有了突破，都能将其推广到其他两者。	As we improve our understanding of the problems that any one of these devices solves – and how it overcomes obstacles in doing so – we learn something valuable about all three.
当1980年���翰·列农被谋杀后，他的一座雕像立即出现在布拉格，每年他的遇难纪念日时都有要求和平和民主的游行。	In 1980, after John Lennon was murdered, a monument to him spontaneously appeared in Prague, and the anniversary of his death was marked by an annual procession for peace and democracy.
但是，不管你讨厌他还是喜欢他（似乎在与他打交道的人中很少有对此无所谓的 ） ， 瓦鲁法基斯从来不是希腊命运的裁判官。	But, love him or hate him (and, it seems, very few people who have encountered him feel indifferent), Varoufakis was never the arbiter of Greece’s fate.
在非盟派遣士兵控制冲突的同时，资源和设备则由联合国和国际社会负责提供，而人们普遍认为这两样处于严重的短缺状态。	While the AU is providing soldiers to police the conflict, the United Nations and the international community have been tasked with providing resources and equipment, which are widely viewed as inadequate.
这些债券的息票率实际比相近期限的主权债务还要低1.5个百分点，这也是不同寻常的，特别是考虑到俄石油目前正在被西方制裁。	The coupon on these bonds was actually 1.5 percentage points below sovereign bonds of similar maturity, which is also unusual, especially given that Rosneft currently is subject to Western sanctions.
类似地，布基纳法索国家农村地区规划（National Program for Rural Areas）也要“以可持续的方式促进粮食和营养安全，重塑经济增长，减少贫困 。 ”	Likewise, the aim of Burkina Faso’s National Program for Rural Areas is to “contribute in a sustainable way to food and nutrition security, to strong economic growth, and to reducing poverty.”
大部分埃及伊斯兰主义者，特别是从流亡沙特归来者，都属于严格限制妇女的瓦哈比（Wahhabi）派，这意味着妇女地位将远不及革命前的状态。	Most of Egypt’s Islamists, particularly those who returned from exile in Saudi Arabia, adhere to the Wahhabi sect, with its severe restrictions on women, implying that women’s status would be much worse than it was before the revolution.
这也跟前总理温家宝的评论是一致的，他在2007年3月曾经警告说，中国经济越来越“不稳定，不平衡，不协调，并（最终）不可持续 ” 。	It is also consistent with the critique of former Premier Wen Jiabao, who in March 2007 famously warned of a Chinese economy that was becoming increasingly “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and [ultimately] unsustainable.”
自从二十世纪九十年代逊尼和什叶派冲突最初爆发以来，巴林领导人一直指责伊朗干预其内部事务（尽管就此提供的证据非常薄弱 ） 。	Ever since Sunni-Shia strife first erupted there in the 1990s, Bahrain’s leaders have accused Iran of meddling in its affairs (despite offering flimsy evidence).
贸易、移民、毒品、安全和地区问题将继续主导双边议程，而在上述所有领域，奥夫拉多尔将面对近一个世纪以来怀有最强敌意的美国总统。	Trade, immigration, drugs, security, and regional issues will continue to dominate the bilateral agenda, and on all these fronts, AMLO will face the most adversarial US president in nearly a century.
忘记、抑或尽量忘记因为选择暴力应对叙利亚人民的和平起义，25万人的死亡必须由巴沙尔·阿萨德直接或间接负责。	Forget, or try to forget, the quarter-million deaths for which Bashar al-Assad is responsible, directly or indirectly, since choosing to respond with violence to a peaceful uprising of the Syrian people.
现在意大利有了毕普·格里罗，格里罗成功赢得刚刚结束的大选使他成为有史以来领导欧洲主要政党的首位专业喜剧演员。	And now Italy has Beppe Grillo, whose success in the country’s recent election makes him the first professional comedian to lead a major political party in Europe.
英国拥有丰富的外交经验，强大的国际影响力以及军事和经济资源，可用来支持联合行动，同样地，欧盟的支持能够大大提升英国政策在世界舞台的影响。	The UK has significant diplomatic experience, international influence, and military and economic resources that can be brought to bear on joint ventures, just as the EU’s backing can provide a major boost to UK policies on the world stage.
利用合作社的成功方面，总结其缺点教训，可以使我们在寻找更加开放包容的可持续发展模式，更加新颖的知识构建和知识分享体系时，拥有更多的选择。	Capitalizing on cooperatives’ successes and learning from their mistakes can help us to expand the menu of options as we search for more inclusive and sustainable models of development, and new ways of building and sharing knowledge.
而这样一个“实打实”的选择要求有全欧洲所有党派的竞选活动来共同组成，其中还包括让选民通过决定欧洲议会选举的结果来选定谁是欧盟委员会主席。	And a real choice requires Europe-wide election campaigns by all parties. This would also involve making the choice of the European Commission’s president dependent on the outcome of the EP elections.
此外，以色列也关心诸如巴基斯坦等国（有朝一日，伊朗也可能跻身其间）在核原料以及核技术出口方面的潜力。	The potential for export of nuclear material and know-how by countries such as Pakistan – and perhaps one day Iran – is also a matter of concern for Israel.
2014年人民币兑美元的略微贬值并非货币操纵的证据；其他许多货币 — — 最值得关注的包括日元和欧元 — — 去年贬值幅度大得多。	The renminbi's slight depreciation against the dollar in 2014 is not evidence of it; many other currencies, most notably the yen and the euro, depreciated by far more last year.
西方和非洲的观察员指责选举中大量的投票舞弊行为玷污了选举的结果，然而，尼日利亚最高法院尚未对选举合法性的挑战作出裁决。	Western and African observers charged that widespread vote-rigging had tainted the official result, and Nigeria’s Supreme Court has yet to rule on challenges to the election’s legality.
1969年中苏军事冲突爆发后，美国对华政策立刻进入了第三阶段，美国积极寻求利用共产主义世界内部裂痕，拉拢中国进入其反苏战略中。	The third phase began immediately after the 1969 Sino-Soviet military clashes, with the US actively seeking to exploit the rift in the Communist world by aligning China with its anti-Soviet strategy.
实际上，看电视是种危险陋习的证据已经十分明显，以至于没有人提出强烈的警告和有效的防御措施，的确让人感到非常奇怪。	Indeed, by now the evidence that television watching is a dangerous habit has grown to such proportions that it is a wonder that stronger warnings and effective prevention have not been adopted.
查韦斯，以及随后的马杜罗，所采取的政策让委内瑞拉岌岌可危：挥霍、征没、价格和外汇管制，以及肆无忌惮地从海外借钱。	Chávez, and then Maduro, adopted policies that put Venezuela in a very weak position: lavish spending, expropriation, price and foreign-exchange controls, and reckless borrowing abroad.
（1981年以色列轰炸了伊拉克Osirak的核反应堆，然而九年后，萨达姆·侯赛因还是具备了在一年内制造出原子弹的能力。 ）	(Nine years after Israel’s bombing raid on Iraq’s nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981, Saddam Hussein was nevertheless within a year of having an atomic bomb.)
加州大学伯克利分校的卢卡斯·戴维斯（Lucas Davis）的研究表明，墨西哥城在1989年实施过类似政策，但并没有减轻空气污染（这是政策的初衷 ） ， 也没有大幅缓解交通拥堵。	Research by Lucas Davis of the University of California, Berkeley, had already shown that a similar policy, implemented in Mexico City in 1989, did not reduce air pollution – the intended goal – or significantly ease traffic congestion.
对美国开明领导的潜在全球需求最早始于第一次世界大战结束之时，并能在预算收缩甚至误入歧途的军事干预中保存下来，但却逃不过美国国会对这一利益的主动放弃。	Latent global demand for enlightened US leadership, which first appeared at the end of World War I, can survive budgetary constraints and even misguided military interventions. What it cannot survive is an abdication of interest by the US Congress.
潜在的希腊退出将在未来几个月内给中国带来完全不同的新挑战，中国不能因为对此风险敞口小而高枕无忧，需要马上制定出立足现在、着眼未来的作战计划。	A potential Grexit will present entirely new challenges to China in the coming months, and the country must avoid complacency over its own exposure. A battle plan for both the present and the future is needed now.
排日风潮包括（日本 ） “ 主动”对威胁美国重工业的商品出口进行限制。 （美国国内）在这方面游说的政治势力非常强大和集中。	Whereas Japan bashing included “vol­untary” restraints on exports that threatened US heavy industries, where lobbies were concentrated and politically potent, recent Chinese exports have mainly been low- to middle-tech products of light industry.
明年举行的巴黎峰会需要达成更具实质内容的协议，采取包括试行全球碳定价在内的统一有效手段来支持国家实现减排目标。	The Paris summit next year needs to produce a more substantial agreement, with national emissions-reduction targets underpinned by adequate and coordinated tools for implementation, including a trial global carbon price.
2012年俄罗斯外国直接投资有大约一半去向荷兰、塞浦路斯和瑞士（非欧盟成员，但在欧盟影响力范围内 ） ， 而流入的外国直接投资有75%来自欧盟国家。	Roughly half of Russian foreign direct investment in 2012 went to the Netherlands, Cyprus, and Switzerland (which is not an EU member, but is subject to EU pressure), while an estimated 75% of Russia’s inward FDI comes from EU countries.
我知道，那些景象鼓励人们抛售股票，对1987年股市大跌起到推波助澜的作用，因为我在随后的一周对个体和机构投资者进行了调查。	I know that those images contributed to the severity of the 1987 crash by encouraging people to sell, because I ran a survey of individual and institutional investors the following week.
尽管德国经济引擎动力十足，并且起到了推动欧元区增长、保持其稳定的作用，但对德国巨额外部盈余的批评仍然日益严重。	Despite the vitality of the German economic engine, and the role it plays in fueling growth and maintaining stability in the eurozone, criticism of the country’s massive external surplus is mounting.
但最终获得战略纵深的其实是塔利班 — — 它在以巴基斯坦为基地与阿富汗开展的游击战争取得了优势，而这场战争则对巴基斯坦的安全构成严重威胁。	But it is the Taliban that ultimately gained strategic depth in its Pakistan-based guerrilla war with Afghanistan – a war that has become a serious threat to Pakistan’s security.
随着特朗普混乱的总统任期的继续展开，有一件事是肯定的：他所引入的任何政策、所采取的任何行动，都将基于深刻的无知乃至元无知（meta-ignorance ） 。	As Trump’s chaotic presidency continues to unfold, one thing that we can know for sure is that any policy he introduces, and any action he takes, will occur against a backdrop of deep ignorance, and even meta-ignorance.
在这一“高度全球化”时期，世界上两个收入得以增加的群体是富国和穷国中最顶层的那1％富人，还有一些亚洲国家（中国，印度，印尼，泰国和越南）的中产阶级。	During this period of “high globalization,” the two segments of the world making gains were the wealthiest 1% in rich and poor countries and the middle class in a few Asian countries – namely China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
当两个泡沫均以破灭收场时，过度消费的美国家庭别无选择，只能削减开支，通过偿还巨额债务和补充耗竭的储蓄来重建其受损的资产负债表。	When both bubbles burst, over-extended US households had no choice but to cut back and rebuild their damaged balance sheets by paying down outsize debt burdens and rebuilding depleted savings.
拜新信息和通讯技术所赐，非洲人，特别是非洲年轻人，对信息了解得更多，也更积极地参与民间和政治事务，越来越具备问责领导人的能力。	Owing to new information and communication technologies, Africans, particularly young Africans, are better informed, more engaged in civil and political discourse, and increasingly capable of holding their leaders accountable.
新产业需要创新型、富于创造力的人力资源，我们将改变我们的补贴方向，让身处夕阳产业、得不到适当工作岗位的工人找到朝阳产业的前途光明的工作。	New industries require innovative and creative human resources, and we will redirect our subsidies so that workers without meaningful employment in declining industries can move on and find rewarding work in rising sectors.
不幸的是，特朗普总统的政府并不在这一“普遍同意”的行列中，因为该政府正忙于在一系列活动中废止环保措施。	Unfortunately, “widely accepted” does not include by President Donald Trump’s administration, which is busy rolling back environmental protections across a broad range of activities.
伊斯兰国现在也在使用相似的战略，以残忍的军事行动与煽风点火的社交媒体攻势相结合，以残忍行刑的照片和视频 — — 包括将美国和其他西方公民斩首的画面 — — 为武器。	The Islamic State is now employing a similar strategy, mixing ruthless military operations with an incendiary social-media campaign, punctuated by photos and videos of brutal executions, including the beheading of US and other Western citizens.
在美国能够建立起包罗万象、目的导向的框架来与世界发生关系之前，难免要采取被动方式，我们在本月所看到的轩然大波将继续成为常态。	Until the US is able to establish an overarching, purpose-oriented framework through which it relates to the world, a reactive approach is inevitable, with high-intensity incidents such as we have seen this month continuing to be the norm.
无论是科学出版物、研究人员或接受高质量高等教育人群的总体数量，欧洲与国际合作伙伴（同时也是竞争对手）相比都毫不逊色。	In terms of numbers – whether of scientific publications, researchers, or overall access to high-quality tertiary education – Europe compares favorably with its international partners (which are also competitors).
但托尼·布莱尔失去最出色、也最忠诚的内阁友人Alan Milburn，则纯粹是因为后者希望有更多时间陪伴家人。	But Tony Blair lost one of his best and most loyal cabinet friends, Alan Milburn, because he genuinely wanted to spend more time with his family.
一个并不过分的比较是，如今美国所面临的问题是是否能在将保护其全球影响力的责任委托给他人或技术工具的情况下维持其世界领先的实力。	Without making undue comparisons, the question for the United States today is whether it can remain the world’s leading power while delegating to others or to technological tools the task of protecting its global influence.
这也要求明年在美国举行的致力于叫停和销毁所有大规模杀伤性武器（核武器、化学武器和生物武器）的2002年全球伙伴（Global Partnership）计划重新启动并扩大规模。	This will also require that the 2002 Global Partnership, dedicated to securing and eliminating all weapons of mass destruction – nuclear, chemical, and biological – is renewed and expanded when it convenes next year in the US.
具有讽刺意味的是，这发生在国际货币基金组织应该希望借出资金的时候：它流动性充裕，并且除了成员国偿还其贷款外几乎没有其他的收入来源。	Ironically, this is happening at a moment when the Fund should want to be lending: it is awash in liquidity and has almost no sources of income other than repayment of its loans.
该企业以发展第一个横扫人类世界冠军的Go围棋程序而天下闻名 — — 据说中国军方就是在这个信号的激发下开始全力以赴研究人工智能。	DeepMind is famous for developing the first world champion-beating Go program, a signal moment that reputedly sparked the Chinese military to start an all-out effort to lead in AI.
但我们还应该扩大STEM教育的范围，以确保学生学会评估和应对他们的工作所带来的社会、经济和政治后果。	But we should also expand the scope of STEM education, to ensure that students learn to evaluate and respond to the social, economic, and political consequences of their work.
选用这样的措辞并非偶然，而是表明美国在伊朗问题上正在改变方针。 10多年来 ， “ 伊朗核问题是谁的问题 ？ ”	Indeed, Israel’s critics were already arguing that this was another case of the tail wagging the dog – that Israel and its American lobby were trying to push the US into serving Israel’s interests rather than its own.
奥地利和匈牙利犹太人是奥匈国王最为忠诚的支持者，因为他让犹太人免受占人口多数���的暴力性收归国有。	Austrian and Hungarian Jews were among the most fiercely loyal subjects of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor, because he shielded them from the violent nationalism of the majority populations.
然而即便是将企业税率从35％降至30％都很困难，共和党人将不得不通过迫使那些目前缴税较少的行业（如药品和科技行业）更多缴税来扩大税基。	Even cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 30% would be difficult. Republicans would have to broaden the tax base by forcing entire sectors – such as pharmaceuticals and technology – that currently pay little in taxes to start paying more.
换句话说，投资者愿意以垄断财富为抵押，为公司债务提供融资，股市的大部分交易因此也可以视为是垄断财富所有权的交易。	In other words, investors have agreed to finance corporate debt by using monopoly wealth as collateral, and most trading in the stock market can therefore be thought of as traded ownership of monopoly wealth.
但这些罪行和他们70年前在伏尔加河畔对人类 — — 特别是对西欧人 — — 做出的贡献一比不值一提。	But these crimes fall short by an order of magnitude of the great service to humanity – and especially to western European humanity – that they gave in the rubble along the Volga River 70 years ago this fall.
那些经受不断上涨现在高达两位数的通货膨胀的国家将不得不提高其利率，同时其他高通胀国家将失去出口竞争优势。	Those experiencing rising and now double-digit inflation will have to raise interest rates, while other high-inflation countries will lose export competitiveness.
这个数字背后的残酷现实是：很多年轻母亲们正死于缺少多数人在二十一世纪已经习以为常的服务 — — 那就是负担得起的医疗保健服务。	The harsh reality behind these figures is this: mothers, very often young, are dying for lack of what most of us take for granted in the twenty-first century – access to affordable health care.
政府官员想必已经意识到英国达不到2%的目标所能带来的尴尬，因此他们在四处寻找能塞进国防部预算、以抬高开支的计划。	Government officials presumably recognize the embarrassment that would be caused were Britain to fall short of the 2% target, so they seem to be looking for programs that can be squeezed into the Defense Department’s budget to pad spending.
2007—2011年担任智利中央银行行长的德格雷戈里奥（José De Gregorio）是一个显著的例外。	José De Gregorio, the governor of the Central Bank of Chile from 2007 to 2011, is an important exception.
在2007-2008年危机面前目瞪口呆的美联储一而再、再而三地压注于战略对策，先是推出两轮量化宽松又继之以目前开放式的重复操作，并因此不断加深对问题的误判。	Blindsided by the crisis of 2007-2008, the Fed has compounded its original misdiagnosis of the problem by repeatedly doubling down on tactical responses, with two rounds of QE preceding the current, open-ended iteration.
一百年前，俄国革命面临着列宁的钢铁意志和克伦斯基（Alexander Kerensky）的优柔寡断之间的抉择，后者最后黯然离开圣彼得堡，逃离布尔什维克之手。	A century ago, the Russian Revolution came down to a showdown between the iron will of Vladimir Lenin and the indecisiveness of Alexander Kerensky, who ended up sneaking out of Saint Petersburg to escape the Bolsheviks.
今年前两个月，西奈省报告其摧毁了25部装甲车（包括坦克、扫雷车和推土机 ） ， 杀掉了100名士兵（军方承认的死亡人数为37人 ） 。	In the first two months of this year, SP reported that it had destroyed 25 armored vehicles (including tanks, minesweepers, and bulldozers) and killed 100 soldiers (the military acknowledged 37).
实际上，知识产权永远也不该成为贸易谈判的内容，这至少部分是因为知识产权规定显然超出了贸易谈判代表们所能处理的范畴。	In fact, intellectual property should never have been included in a trade agreement in the first place, at least partly because its regulation is demonstrably beyond the competency of trade negotiators.
但不幸的是，虽然显然无法永远维持这种和谐状态，但当前的情况却往往被视为半永久性的，制造出一种稳定的幻觉，也削弱了实施推动未来增长的艰难改革的决心。	Unfortunately, though such accommodation cannot be sustained forever, today’s conditions are often viewed as semi-permanent, creating the illusion of stability and reducing the incentive to undertake difficult reforms that promote future growth.
安倍将在今年新加坡香格里拉对话（Shangri La Dialogue）的政策演说中阐释这一点。 香格里拉对话是亚洲军事和文职领导人年会。	Abe will make this clear when he delivers the keynote address in Singapore at this year’s Shangri La Dialogue, the annual meeting of Asian military and civilian military leaders.
对于那些像我们这样信仰多维文化的人来说，我们对他所作的巨大努力、对他对“天主教教义”所作的原意阐述及其兼容并包的挂念关心深表感激。	Those of us who believe in a multidimensional culture will be grateful to him for his enormous efforts, thus for his “catholicism” in the original sense of the word, his all-embracing concerns.
其次，确实选择了德国、法国、斯堪的纳维亚英国或匈牙利为目的地的少数人也不是为了摧毁我们，甚至不是为了寄食于欧洲纳税人。	Second, the minority who do choose Germany, France, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, or Hungary are not enemies who have come to destroy us or even to sponge off of European taxpayers.
沃尔特·白芝浩1873年的经典著作《朗伯德街》将伦敦形容为“全球有史以来经济力量和经济脆弱性最完美的结合 。 ”	Walter Bagehot’s 1873 classic Lombard Street described the City of London as “the greatest combination of economic power and economic delicacy that the world has ever seen.”
由美国参议员卡尔·莱文（Carl Levin）和约翰·麦凯恩（John McCain）牵头的关于著名的“伦敦鲸”交易的最新两党调查报告只是一个例子。	The report of the recent bipartisan investigation, led by US Senators Carl Levin and John McCain, into the infamous “London Whale” trades provides just one example.
此外，奥巴马还面临了重大约束，包括全球经济危机、国内政治两极分化、敌意国会，以及需要美国又不愿接受美国主导的新兴大国的崛起。	Moreover, Obama has been confronted with significant constraints, including the global economic crisis, domestic political polarization, a hostile Congress, and the rise of emerging powers that need the US but are unwilling to accept its dominance.
当然，克林顿 — — 在顽固的民主党建制派的“帮助”下 — — 的选战活动表现绵软无力、毫无远见卓识，完全忽视了感到被全球化抛弃的数百万人不断发酵的愤怒，也是她输掉竞选的原因。	It did not help, of course, that Clinton – enabled by an obstinate Democratic Party establishment – ran a weak and visionless campaign that ignored the mounting anger of millions of voters who felt left behind by globalization.
皮尤研究中心的最新研究指出，2014年美国人的收入比2000年少4 % ， 并且40多年来第一次出现中产阶级不再占人口大部分的情况。	A recent study by the Pew Research Center noted that Americans earned 4% less income in 2014 than they did in 2000, and for the first time in more than 40 years, middle-class Americans no longer constitute a majority of the population.
最后，由于政策制定者无疑会在未来的裁军谈判中提出与核查有关的要求，因此得到有力技术证据支持的可信回应对于缓解作弊的恐惧至关重要。	Finally, because policymakers will no doubt make demands related to verification during future disarmament negotiations, persuasive answers, supported by strong technical evidence, will be critical to allaying fears about cheating.
预计塞浦路斯也将加入“计划国 ” （ 希腊、爱尔兰和葡萄牙）行列，要求大规模正式融资；而在上述三国中，只有爱尔兰接近于重新正常进入资本市场。	Cyprus is expected to join the other three “program countries” (Greece, Ireland, and Portugal) in requiring considerable official financing; and, of the other three, only Ireland is getting close to regaining normal access to capital markets.
Project Syndicate集团最初由另外一名亿万富翁乔治·索罗斯赞助，现在独立运营发表鲜有经济效益的观点和分析文章（在可以预见的未来既没���软广告也没有产品评述 ） 。	Originally funded by yet another billionaire, George Soros, Project Syndicate operates independently to provide hard-to-monetize informed opinion and analysis with nary an “advertorial” or product review in sight.
随着乌克兰危机的展开，俄罗斯决策者和评论家大谈“后冷战时代的结束 ” ， 而俄罗斯副总理罗戈津（Dimitri Rogozin）甚至表示了欢迎新冷战的开始。	As the Ukraine crisis unfolded, Russian policymakers and commentators talked about “the end of the Post-Cold War era,” while Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dimitri Rogozin even appeared to welcome the start of a New Cold War.
自实施以来，ECT被针对东道国的能源企业援引过100多次，其中一些是对国家能源政策，如德国逐步退出核电的战略的挑战。	Since its inception, the ECT has served as the basis for more than 100 claims by energy firms against host countries, with some challenging national environmental policies, such as the nuclear phase-out in Germany.
在危机伊始，美国各大金融机构在拉美债务上的风险敞口达到200 % ， 在这种情况下，过于坦率地承认债务不可持续性几乎一定会搞垮全球金融体系。	At the outset of that crisis, major US financial institutions’ capital exposure to Latin America was near 200%, making candid recognition of debt unsustainability the surest route to wiping out the global financial system.
例如，深受捷克总统瓦克拉夫•克劳斯影响的捷克公民民主党将波兰形容为捷克共和国最重要的盟友和新成员国应该如何接近欧盟的范例。	For example, the Czech Civic Democratic Party, heavily influenced by Czech President Vaclav Klaus, describes Poland as the Czech Republic's chief ally and an example of how new members should approach the EU.
意大利等较大的国家有激励忽视在本国海岸登陆的大量难民，因为它们知道，如果什么都不做，这些难民有可能会去往别的地方（主要是北欧 ） 。	And larger countries like Italy have an incentive to overlook the large numbers of refugees landing on their shores, knowing that, if nothing is done, those refugees will likely head elsewhere (mainly to northern Europe).
这段时间中超过一半 — — 就算85年吧 — — 还有一个公认的理论，那就是为了防范流动性紧张或通胀泡沫出现，即便在正常情况下也不要信任市场。	For more than half that time – say, 85 years – it has been accepted doctrine that markets are also not to be trusted even in normal times, lest doing so lead to a liquidity squeeze or to an inflationary bubble.
旨在遏制仇恨言论、暴力或假新闻的法律可能用意不坏，但执行过程却草率不堪，缺乏确保问责制、透明度或可逆性的相关机制。	Laws meant to curb hate speech, violence, or “fake news” may be well intentioned, but their implementation has been sloppy, with few mechanisms to ensure accountability, transparency, or reversibility.
发自首尔 — — 中日韩三国领导人已经在上个月达成共识，同意在今年晚些时候启动与一项三边自由贸易有关的协议。	SEOUL – Last month, the leaders of China, Japan, and South Korea agreed to begin negotiations later this year on a trilateral free-trade agreement.
亚洲区别的理由很多：历史、文化多样性、尚未解决的领土和政治争议、缺乏多边经验以及一个或两个权力中心的控制。	There are many reasons why Asia is different: history, cultural diversity, unresolved territorial and political disputes, a lack of multilateral experience, and the predominance of one or two centers of power.
允许外国人拥有企业全部产权以及合理保护他们的财产权利的立法亦然 — — 这还会带来额外的好处，即鼓励侨民在本地储蓄和投资。	So, too, would legislation to allow full ownership of enterprises by foreigners and the proper protection of their property rights – which would have the added benefit of encouraging expatriates to save and invest locally.
这两个新兴大国仍由极权政府领导，主宰它们的执政精英之腐败 — — 从他们所聚敛的财富看 — — 堪称历史之最。	These two large emerging countries are still led by authoritarian governments, headed by ruling elites who – given how much wealth they have amassed – may be the most corrupt in history.
以低廉的价格购买一半的比雷埃夫斯港与其说是从长远角度投资希腊的经济和金融，还不如说是趁火打劫占取便宜。 但实际情况是否真的如此？	To buy half of the Piraeus harbor at a knockdown price may seem more advantageous than investing in the long-term consolidation of the Greek economy and its finances, but is that really the case?
虔诚的穆斯林 — — 特别是那些认为土耳其的城市开发产生了太多的寻租和太多的暴富的人 — — 也也加入了示威活动，一些极左组织亦然。	Pious Muslims – particularly those who believe that Turkey’s urban development has created too much rent-seeking and too many easy fortunes – joined the demonstrations as well, as did some far-left groups.
随着时间的推移，在经济自由主义挤出长久以来平等和社会团结原则的同时，造成了巨大的贫富差距，并因此侵蚀了许多西方国家的政治。	Over time, as economic liberalism has crowded out longstanding principles of equality and social solidarity, vast wealth disparities have emerged, corrupting many Western countries’ politics.
这一战略与普京在叙利亚的战略配合得天衣无缝，俄罗斯在叙利亚已经成为根除伊斯兰国（ISIS）行动的一股重要力量。	This strategy aligns seamlessly with Putin’s approach in Syria, where Russia has already made itself a vital partner in any effort to root out the Islamic State (ISIS).
今年上半年真实GDP增长率约为4 % （ 尽管在第三季度又回到了2%以下 ） ， 据此，第一支箭可谓正中目标，可以打一个A+。	With real GDP growth around 4% in the first half of the year (though it did fall below 2% in the third quarter), the first arrow has already hit the bull’s eye – a performance worthy of an A+.
这次峰会可谓及时，因为金融稳定性委员会将很快迎来新的领导人，现任主席马里奥·德拉基（Mario Draghi）将于11月出任欧洲央行行长。	The meeting is particularly timely, because the FSB will soon be under new leadership, as its current chairman, Mario Draghi, takes over in November as President of the European Central Bank.
以色列和美国将哈马斯从加沙驱逐出去的努力以及迫使哈马斯接受条件以换取结束对其的国际封锁都彻底失败了。	Israel and the United States failed resoundingly in their attempt to dislodge Hamas from Gaza, or in forcing it to accept conditions for an end to the international boycott.
例如许多学者，专家和实践者都赞同谷歌母公司Alphabet执行主席埃里克·施密特（Eric Sc​​hmidt）的说法，认为技术现象具有人类“无法理解”也不应该去“扰乱”的一系列固有特性。	Many scholars, pundits, and practitioners would agree with Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt that technological phenomena have their own intrinsic properties, which humans “don’t understand” and should not “mess with.”
与此同时，对高收入劳动者的工资税上限可能被提高，而针对高收入家庭的扭曲性税收减免（例如相关抵押贷款利率）则会收紧。	At the same time, the cap on payroll taxes for upper-income workers could be raised, and distorting tax deductions, like that for mortgage interest, could be tightened for upper-income households.
内部的单一市场对欧盟得以成为全球最繁荣区域至关重要，而在环境可持续发展方面欧盟在世界上也扮演着领导角色。	The single market has been crucial to making Europe one of the most prosperous places on the planet. And the EU has been a global leader on environmental sustainability.
如果认识正确，同时致力于根本性、哪怕是渐进的变化，数字平台的社会和政治影响力可以创造 — — 或至少是改善当今陷入困境的民主体制的安全环境。	With the right insights, and a commitment to fundamental, if incremental, change, the social and political impact of digital platforms can be made safe – or at least safer – for today’s beleaguered democracies.
随着该国本土研发能力 — — 更不用说技术吸收 — — 的大幅提升，几乎没有必要继续去保护中国的所谓“新生”产业。	With the country’s capacity for indigenous R&D – not to mention technological absorption – having progressed substantially, there is little need to continue protecting Chinese “infant” industries.
但事实上核事务只是双方���以对峙合理化的工具，伊朗领导人用它来向国内听众煽动核爱国主义情绪，而美国人则借此向国外听众宣扬核浓缩威胁论。	Indeed, the nuclear issue has served to rationalize the face-off, with Iran’s leaders playing to their domestic audience by whipping up nuclear nationalism and the US playing to the international audience by harping on the proliferation threat.
而事实上在陈水扁的政策之下，台湾社会几近分裂，变成一个“本地”和“非本地”华人互相视为潜在敌人的社会。	Indeed, under Chen’s policy, Taiwan nearly became a rigidly divided society, where “local” and “not native” Chinese lived as potential enemies.
尽管朴槿惠的北京之行并没有完全弥合中国和韩国关于朝鲜核问题的分歧，但的确为两国政府跟紧密的合作做了铺垫。	Though Park’s visit to Beijing has not closed the gap between the Chinese and South Korean approaches to the North Korean nuclear issue, it does seem to have prepared the ground for closer coordination between the two governments.
而在2009年，随着全球危机的蔓延，却很难区分赢家和输家；每个人似乎都是输家，即使有些国家比其它国家受到的影响更大。	Everyone seems to be a loser, even if some are more affected than others.
通过制定明智、全面、明确的策略，私人公司不但能因为自己的努力而获得赞誉；还能助力政府为SDG建立现实的预算和明确的融资计划。	By creating smart, comprehensive, and clearly defined strategies, private companies can not only get credit for their efforts; they can also help governments to establish realistic budgets and clear financing plans for the SDGs.
可以效仿的榜样很多：迪拜、新加坡、泰国、马来西亚、墨西哥、印度尼西亚和韩国都是非洲人民所景仰的成功实现转型的经济体。	There are plenty of models to follow: Dubai, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, and South Korea are all admired by Africans as economies that managed to transform themselves.
中国上升的贸易顺差让某些观察家呼吁对人民币重新估价，以便修正他们所认为的中国在国际市场中维持的不公平的竞争优势。	China’s rising trade surplus has led some observers to call for a revaluation of the renminbi to correct what they see as an unfair competitive advantage that China maintains in international markets.
在这样的条件下，过去半个世纪的课程表必须重新设计，一个指导事项是要确保工人具备更高水平的能轻松适应范围甚广的多种行业的“元技能 ” 。	In this context, curricula that have defined education for the last half-century must be rethought, with a view toward ensuring that workers are equipped with higher-level “meta-skills” that can be adapted easily to a broad array of industries.
1894年，法国陆军上尉阿尔弗雷德·德雷福斯（Alfred Dreyfus）在受到操纵的庭审中蒙冤被控叛国，这导致法国社会分裂为两个阵营，一边是反德雷福斯者，大多是保守派，另一边是身为犹太军官的德雷福斯的捍卫者，大多是自由派。	When the French army captain Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused of treason in a rigged trial in 1894, French society was divided between mostly conservative anti-Dreyfusards and liberal defenders of the Jewish officer.
特里谢在记者见面会上对这一消息断章取义，令人听起来似乎是ECB想要将政策转变为准备降息（easing bias）而不是“等着瞧”的中立。	Trichet somehow garbled the Council’s message in his press conference, making it sound as if the ECB wanted to shift to an easing bias instead of “wait and see” neutrality.
只有三项试验 — — 全都在欧洲进行 — — 把伪针灸作为了一种控制手段，由于面临很大的文化障碍，没有报道称在中国进行过安慰性的或伪针灸的针灸试验。	And only three trials—all conducted in Europe—used sham acupuncture as a control, whereas no acupuncture trials controlled with placebos or sham acupuncture have been reported in China, owing to high cultural barriers.
参议员桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）提出、并获得国会通过的艾滋病奖励基金法（Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act）只是一个开始。	The Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act, a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, is just such an initiative.
而“开放数据”概念则全球规划机构所采纳的其中一项最重要创新，任何人都可以利用这些信息来改善公共生活的方方面面。	One of the most significant innovations being embraced by the world’s planning agencies is the concept of “open data,” information that can be used by anyone to improve any aspect of public life.
现今繁荣的这些经济活动长期以来是被归入服务业，而非制造业的，但是服务业并不意味着脱离实际，与世隔绝。	Previously, the economic activities that are now flourishing weren’t categorized as manufacturing industries at all, but as “services.” But services do not exist in a vacuum.
当失业上升、收入下降到历史最低点以及内部紧张局势升级之时，哈马斯和法塔赫两派支持者之间的战斗开始了。	With unemployment rising, income dropping to record low levels, and internal tensions escalating, fighting between supporters of Hamas and Fatah began.
最高领导人哈梅内伊主要通过控制伊朗和区域内宗教权威机构和什叶派组织的经济来源，成功地促使什叶派宗教机构实现了政治化。	Khamenei, the supreme leader, has succeeded in politicizing the Shiite clerical establishment, primarily by controlling the financial resources of the religious authorities and Shiite institutions in Iran and the region.
前首相小泉纯一郎（于2000至2004年间执政）和他的首席经济顾问兼财政大臣竹中平藏对日本在生产率方面节节败退的情况十分清楚。	Former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi (in power between 2000 and 2004) and his chief economic adviser and minister of finance, Heizo Takenaka, understood all too well that Japan was losing ground in terms of productivity.
“我们已经从过去15年的错误中，特别是从在某种程度上忽略了人民运动的错误中，吸取了教训 。 ” 他在四月份于非洲国民大会党横扫对手取得胜利之前，如是说。	“We have learned from the mistakes of the past 15 years, especially the manner of which we may have, to some degree, neglected the people’s movement,” he said in April, before his African National Congress swept to victory.
伊拉克的现任政治领导人需要从这些历史中吸取教训，并保证伊拉克的所有派别都不会被边缘化或受到歧视，这些教训是从穆斯林世界的全部历史中提炼出来的。	Iraq’s current political leaders need to learn from this past and ensure that none of the country’s communities face marginalization or discrimination – lessons that apply throughout the Muslim world.
我们不应垂头丧气，而应遵循德国社会学大家麦克斯·韦伯所珍视的一项区别，因为责任伦理优先于信仰伦理之上，现在恰逢其时。	Instead of throwing up our hands in despair, we should adhere to a distinction dear to the great German sociologist Max Weber, for now is a time when the ethics of responsibility must prevail over the ethics of conviction.
尽管伊朗官员竭尽全力降低了制裁的影响，但通货膨胀仍然难以控制在30%以下，今年的GDP增长率预计只有1 % 。	Despite Iranian officials’ best efforts to downplay the sanctions’ impact, it is difficult to spin inflation in excess of 30% and projected GDP growth of just 1% this year.
尽管我将在2018年年底从联合利华退休，但我相信，这家我所领导了十多年的公司，将继续在注重加强可持续性的情况下改善商业流程。	Although I will be retiring from Unilever at the end of 2018, I am confident that the company I have led for more than a decade will continue to improve business processes with an eye toward strengthening sustainability.
一份国际货币基金组织（IMF）对危机前监管的研究表明 ， “ 有统一监管机构的国家[在当时一般不属于央行 ] ， 监管质量的一致性更好 。 ”	An International Monetary Fund study of pre-crisis regulation concluded that “countries with integrated supervisory agencies [at that time generally outside the central bank] enjoy greater consistency in quality of supervision.”
这意味着欧洲央行能为提交由国际货币基金组织、欧洲央行和欧洲委员会这三驾马车共同监管的财政紧缩计划的国家设定借贷成本上限。	This will enable the ECB to put a lid on the borrowing costs of countries that submit to an austerity program under the supervision of the Troika (the IMF, the ECB, and the European Commission).
由于国际银行不管位居何处都喜欢用美元借贷，因此这些互换安排相当于让外国中央银行能够在紧急情况时向本地银行提供美元贷款。	Because international banks, wherever they are located, tend to borrow in dollars, the swap arrangements allow foreign central banks to lend dollars to their local banks in times of emergency.
目的是支持他的要求 — — 在到达北京后，他将重申这个要求，即中国要遵守它在联合国安理会做出的承诺，加紧对朝鲜的制裁。	The aim is to buttress his demand, which he will reiterate when he reaches Beijing, that China follow through on its pledges in the United Nations Security Council to tighten sanctions on North Korea.
这更需要我们所有人的努力，加强国际间的相互协调和利用大规模的生态工程项目来“优化”气候，不过，至少目前来说，我们对大部分领域还一无所知。	This will require appropriate human behavior at all levels, and may well involve internationally accepted, large-scale geo-engineering projects to “optimize” climate. At this stage, however, we are still largely treading on terra incognita .
但如果这个机器人被设计为拥有人类的能力，并随之意外导致了意识的产生，那么我们就有理由相信它身上真有意识存在。	But if the robot was designed to have human-like capacities that might incidentally give rise to consciousness, we would have a good reason to think that it really was conscious.
首先，尽管某些服务业细分领域是可贸易的，并且在全球商业中日益重要，但这些领域往往是高度技能密集部门，只需要极少普通工人。	First, while some segments of services are tradable and are becoming more important in global commerce, these typically are highly skill-intensive sectors that employ comparatively few ordinary workers.
首先，不像其他某些国家，中国的商业银行也从强制性的央行储备中获得了合理的利息（除了其自身持有的“额外储备”外 ） ， 因此人行的冲销政策对各银行造成的损失不会太大。	First, unlike in some other countries, Chinese commercial banks are paid reasonable interest rates on required reserves, except for the “extra reserves” that they hold. So they do not lose much, if anything, from the PBC’s sterilization policies.
你会觉得上帝才是你唯一的朋友和家人，因为在连一个可信赖的牧师都被禁止接触的时候，没有人能聆听你的忧虑和希冀。	God, one realizes, is one’s only friend and only available family, because – deprived even of access to a trusted priest – there is no one else in whom to confide one’s worries and hopes.
陈光诚的案件揭露出中国法律体系的弱点，应该可以推动中国人权活动家和更广泛的法律界人士建立更牢固的关系。	Chen’s case reveals weaknesses in China’s legal system, and it should spark a push to build stronger ties between China’s human-rights activists and the broader legal profession.
但是印度和中国的崛起意味着西方民主对新兴国家受到时间验证的姿态，即“按照我们说的去做，不要按照我们做的去做 ” ， 已经不再那么站得住脚了。	But the rise of India and China means that the time-tested posture of Western democracies toward emerging states to “do as we say, not as we do” will become less tenable.
对这些国家来说，成立一个巨型基金测试数百种药物是比培育生物科技初创企业或为大型制药企业提供激励好得多的赌注。	For these countries, forming a megafund to test a few hundred compounds could be a much better bet than seeding biotech startups or offering incentives to big pharmaceutical firms.
纽约—罗西尼·巴尔（Roseanne Barr）是一位美国喜剧演员，他的同名虚构电视角色是一位支持特朗普的工作阶级。	NEW YORK – Roseanne Barr is an American comedian whose fictional TV character of the same name is a working-class Trump supporter.
当然，气候支持者也许会指出，太阳能板和风电涡轮机能为大约2,200万人提供电力 — — 尽管无法做到不间断供电。	Of course, climate campaigners might point out that the solar panels and wind turbines will give electricity – albeit intermittently – to about 22 million people.
也许是受最近美元升值及其影响净出口的首批信号的刺激，国会中的民主党和共和党正在再次考虑采取立法对付它们眼中的不公平货币贬值。	Perhaps spurred by the recent appreciation of the dollar and the first signs that it is eroding net exports, congressional Democrats and Republicans are once again considering legislation to counter what they view as unfair currency undervaluation.
现在每年的维护费用仍高达600万美元，目前只有罗马尼亚议会和艺术博物馆两家使用者，因此70%的面积处于空置。	It still costs more than $6 million a year to maintain the palace, which now houses the Romanian parliament and an art museum, leaving 70% of the building unused.
如果在太平洋地区发生自然灾害，美国和马来西亚已经建立的关系可以在一次联合救灾过程中挽救成千上万人的生命。	In the event of, say, a natural disaster in the Pacific, the bonds that the US and Malaysia have fostered could help save thousands of lives during a combined crisis response.
事实上，墨西哥的齐塔复仇女神最初接受过20世纪90年代向选定的特种部队士兵提供的反暴动训练，而后逃离了特种部队。	Indeed, the furies of the Zetas in Mexico originate in the counter-insurgency training provided in the 1990’s to a select group of special-forces soldiers, who later deserted.
现在，我们必须抛弃意识形态藩篱 — — 不管是左派还是右派 — — 在政策争论中弄清什么才是当务之急。	It is time to look beyond ideology – on the left as well as on the right – and frame the policy debate with that key consideration in mind.
邓小平在上世纪 70 年代末推动中国对外开放时说过一句名言 ： “ 不管黑猫白猫，抓住老鼠的就是好猫 。 ”	When Deng Xiaoping began to open China in the late 1970’s, he said, “It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white. As long as it catches mice, it is a good cat.”
社会党（Socialist Party）候选人席尔瓦（Marina Silva）要求巴西央行正式独立 — — 该主张随后被社会民主党（Social Democratic Party）候选人内维斯（Aécio Neves）采纳，他将在第二轮选举中与罗塞夫一决高下。	Marina Silva, the Socialist Party’s candidate, demanded formal bank independence – an argument subsequently adopted by the Social Democratic Party (PSDB) candidate, Aécio Neves, who now faces Rousseff in the election run-off.
每一天，都有曾经生气勃勃的叙利亚学校被轰炸或武装入侵，200万儿童沦落在难民营或居住在临时搭建的帐篷和小屋中。	Every day, another once-vibrant Syrian school is bombed or militarized, with two million children now in refugee camps or exiled to makeshift tents or huts.
军事领导人已经显示在他们需要时，他们可以迅速地动员军队，这一点已经为去年他们暴力镇压成千上万的和尚和政治激进分子的行动所证实。	The military leaders have shown that they can mobilize their forces in short order when they want, as evidenced by their violent crack down on thousands of monks and political activists last year.
2000年11月，普京批准成立了由政府监管的垄断武器出口机构俄罗斯国防出口公司，从而结束了该国主要武器出口企业间形成的恶性竞争。	In November 2000, Putin approved the creation of a single government-supervised arms exporting agency, Rosoboronexport, to end the self-destructive competition that had developed between the country’s major weapons-exporting enterprises.
在几乎所有其他先进经济体所采用的领土税制下，美国公司将能以很少或免征额外税收的情况下回流其外国子公司的税后利润。	Under the territorial method, which virtually every other advanced economy uses, US corporations will be able to repatriate their foreign subsidiaries’ after-tax profits with little or no extra tax.
能被多数人接受的组织会应运而生，虽然它们并不完美，却至少能产生合法的政府－这样的政府不仅有效，也能被大多数人所接受。	Viable units will emerge that are less than ideal but at least capable of creating legitimate government - meaning a government that is both effective and acceptable.
皮昂泰克还曾描述过“麦克瑞维奇与俄罗斯流氓黑社会头子及金融家塞米昂·莫吉列维奇和俄罗斯主要情报部门的诸多长期关系 。 ”	Piątek has also delineated “numerous and long-term connections between Macierewicz and Russian gangster and financier Semion Mogilevich and the Russian GRU.”
国家对处于困境的公司提供支援的做法非常普遍，旨在确保商品和服务自由流通的共同规则也没有得到成员国的完全遵守¾在这方面公共采购和能源市场就是最主要的例子。	State aid to ailing companies remains ubiquitous, and common rules designed to ensure free circulation of goods and services are not fully respected by the member states - public procurement and energy markets being prime examples.
它甚至有可能说服某些愤怒而可怜的特朗普支持者，让他们认识到他的伪民粹主义政策不是为了帮助铁锈城市和农村腹地的那些留守民众，而是为了让少数人拥有更多财富。	And it might even persuade some angry, poor Trump supporters to recognize that his pseudo-populism is not about helping the left-behind folks in Rust Belt cities and rural hinterlands. It is about giving even more money to the very few.
经济学家阿夫纳·格里夫（Avner Greif）指出，从整个历史过程中看，这些跨种族网络的持续性和恢复力体现了他们在现有制度框架不那么可靠的情况下远程执行契约的能力。	The economist Avner Greif argues that these co-ethnic networks’ durability and resilience throughout history reflects their ability to enforce contracts at long distances when the existing institutional framework could not do so reliably.
在没有共产党控制的情况下，这些安全官员背叛了他们的企业伦理，参与交易，并且在交易不顺利的时候施加力量。	In the absence of Communist Party control, these security officers betrayed their corporate ethic and engaged in horse-trading, applying force when a trade did not go well.
塞齐维克在采访我时提出了一个有趣的观点：由于近年来许多资产价格的波动性急剧下降，石油和其他商品价格的走势趋稳可能只是时间问题。	While interviewing me, Sedgwick raised an interesting point: Given that the volatility of many other asset prices has declined sharply in recent years, it might just be a matter of time before oil and other commodity prices do the same.
例如，在法国，马克龙的政党可以吸收中右翼的法国共和党（Les Republicains ） ， 或者进一步向左翼移动，借助一个社会团结计划来配合其已经采取的自由市场措施。	In France, for example, Macron’s party could absorb the center-right Les Republicains, or it could shift further to the left, with a social solidarity program to accompany the liberal market measures it has already taken.
因此，消费 — — 经济增长的主要引擎 — — 自2000年以来便停滞不前，而失业率几乎在所有国家都在上升，甚至给仍保有工作的人也造成了动荡效应。	For this reason, consumption – the main driver of economic growth – has stagnated since 2000, while unemployment rates have risen almost everywhere, creating instability that affects even those who still have jobs.
压力测试是用来反映大量持有房屋贷款和金融衍生产品的银行未经审计的有害资产的真实情况的，因而，进行压力测试背后的理由似乎是无懈可击的。	The tests were supposed to reveal the true conditions of banks saddled with unaudited toxic assets in housing loans and financial derivatives. The reasoning behind the tests seemed unimpeachable.
在美国，穆迪（Moody’s）30年公司债券月度总回报指数（可追溯至1857年）的全球金融数据（Global Financial Data，GFD）扩展的最大啊单年跌幅为12.5 % ， 发生在1979年3月—1980年2月。	In the US, the biggest one-year drop in the Global Financial Data extension of Moody's monthly total return index for 30-year corporate bonds (going back to 1857) was 12.5% in the 12 months ending in February 1980.
毕竟，SDR篮子在全球金融中只是个配角，而允许人民币加入其中被视为是为了让中国留在布雷顿森林体系所付出的微小代价。	After all, the SDR basket plays a minor role in global finance, and admitting the renminbi was seen as a small price to pay to keep China embedded in the Bretton Woods institutions.
类似地，尽管美国不会弱化其与以色列的双边关系，但以色列总理内塔尼亚胡和奥巴马之间的关系已经创出了新的低点。	Likewise, while the US will not relinquish its bilateral relationship with Israel, relations between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Obama have reached a new low.
如果批评者不理解这一点并采取相应行动，民粹主义者在富裕国家的机会就会像曾经在拉丁美洲一样漫长（且具有破坏性 ） 。	If critics do not understand that and act accordingly, populists will have as long (and destructive) a run in the rich countries as they once had in Latin America.
如今，欧洲政府和公司纷纷敞开怀抱欢迎外国投资者，而中国公司则可望更大的市场、技术和多元化的机会，应该可以在欧洲找到大把机会。	Today, when governments and companies in Europe are opening their arms to foreign investors, Chinese companies eager for markets, technologies, and diversification should find rich pickings.
简言之，支持全球金体系的持续努力显然收到了成效，特别是在增强资本缓冲和清理银行系统的最重要部分的资产负债表方面。	In short, ongoing measures to buttress the global financial system have undoubtedly paid off, especially when it comes to strengthening capital cushions and cleaning up balance sheets in important parts of the banking system.
Facebook联合创始人、硅谷UBI支持领袖克里斯·修斯（Chris Hughes）也呼吁扩大EITC。	Even Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder and leading UBI booster in Silicon Valley, calls for an expanded EITC.
但这类干预十分复杂 — — 不仅是因为它们必须考虑该国货币政策方针与相关国家货币政策方针之间的关系。	But such interventions are complicated – not least because they must account for the relationship between the country’s monetary-policy approach and that of other relevant countries.
随着更多的药物被允许用于治疗双相障碍以及众多警告医生们防范诊断不足的报告的出台，似乎过度诊断已经成为了一个比诊断不足更大的问题。	With the greater number of medications approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder, along with multiple reports cautioning clinicians against under-diagnosis, it appears that over-diagnosis has become a greater problem than under-diagnosis.
当年国际货币外交主要集中在创设一个新型国际储备，并最终演化成为国际货币基金组织的特别提款权（Special Drawing Rights ） 。	Back then, international monetary diplomacy focused on creating a new form of international reserves, what became the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights.
但是，假设储蓄率为20 % （ 接近于发展中国家的平均水平 ） ， 那么每年的侨民储蓄将超过5,000亿美元。	But, assuming a 20% saving rate (close to the average for developing countries), this implies total annual diaspora saving of more than $500 billion.
美国国会目前正在讨论一项法律，该法律上将会对那些已经确定的对马格尼茨基的拘留和死亡负有责任的60余人实行冻结资产和签证禁令。	The United States Congress is currently debating a law that would impose asset freezes and visa bans on the 60 people identified as having had some responsibility for Magnitsky's detention and death.
《中国日报》日前在头版刊登了一则新闻，文章讲述了沃尔福威茨运用威胁性和下流的语言向世界银行的高级官员施压。	The China Daily recently ran a front-page story recounting how Paul Wolfowitz used threats and vulgarities to pressure senior World Bank staff.
但有一个缺陷：天然气协议进一步放大了两国已然十分巨大的双边贸易失衡 — — 俄罗斯向中国出口原材料并从中国进口制造品。	But there is a hitch: the gas deals amplify a significant bilateral trade imbalance, with Russia supplying raw materials to China and importing Chinese manufactures.
这是个典型的囚徒困境：如果所有国家都为共同目标努力，则所有国家都会受益，但国家选举的压力阻碍了政客推行这一目标的能力。	It is a classic prisoner’s dilemma: all countries are better off if they contribute to a common cause, but the pressure of national elections impedes politicians’ ability to champion that cause.
所有证据表明只有一个更可持续、开放和包容的世界经济才能为人类安全、经济繁荣和社会公正的未来提供支持。	All the evidence indicates that only a more sustainable, open, and inclusive world economy can support an environmentally secure, economically prosperous, and socially just future for humanity.
我希望这样的情况还会发生在其他地方，不仅是在罗马尼亚人中间，也在所有准备好面对我们这个时代的挑衅的人们中间。	It will happen, I hope, also in other places and not only with Romanians but with all the people ready to face the provocations of our time.
但在一个真正的债务管理机构和遗留债务管理制度下，成员国新释放出来的财政能力就可能有助于缓解会对这种集权式解决方案的需求。	But, with a real debt-management agency and a regime for managing legacy debt, member states’ newly liberated fiscal capacity might relieve the need for such a centralized solution.
特朗普和国会共和党还将试图撤销2008年金融危机后实施的多德-弗兰克（Dodd-Frank）金融监管，从而让银行和其他金融机构获得更大的自由。	Trump and congressional Republicans will also try to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial regulations that were enacted after the 2008 financial crisis, thereby giving banks and other financial institutions freer rein.
尽管某些日本人由于日本接受了运用武力的限制条款而抱怨同盟安全条款不平等，但在这些新领域中，日本是更强有力的伙伴。	Although some Japanese complain about the unequal nature of the alliance’s security components, owing to the limits that Japan has accepted on the use of force, in these new areas, Japan is a stronger partner.
在这样的环境下自由主义者应该有何作为显而易见：只要普京政权保持自由秩序的基础和制度，自由主义这就应该支持普京。	What liberals should do in these circumstances is obvious: support Putin’s regime insofar as it maintains the foundation and institutions of a liberal order.
当一国放弃其货币主权时，其银行实际上用外币借款，这让它们极易受到流动性冲击，比如2010—2011年引起欧洲银行系统大动荡的那种。	When a country gives up its monetary sovereignty, its banks are effectively borrowing in a foreign currency, making them exceptionally vulnerable to liquidity shocks, like that which sparked turmoil in Europe’s banking system in 2010-2011.
在3月份时，美国前副总统阿尔·戈尔的科学顾问，著名气候研究专家吉姆·汉森公开宣称，当面对全球变暖问题时“民主程序不管用 ” 。	In March, Al Gore’s science adviser and prominent climate researcher, Jim Hansen, proclaimed that when it comes to dealing with global warming, the “democratic process isn’t working.”
但是，普通欧洲人开始观查看地图，而他们所看到的地理情况无法否认：土耳其95％的领土和80％的人口分布在亚洲。	But ordinary Europeans have begun looking at maps, and the geography that they see cannot be denied: 95% of Turkey’s territory and 80% of its population is in Asia.
葡萄牙，西班牙，匈牙利，爱尔兰，比利时，意大利和英国国债赤字累累，正在经受着严峻的考验。 不过，荷兰和奥地利都还算好一些，德法两国更好一些。	Despite high unemployment and low growth, Germany does not face a short-term threat to macroeconomic stability, though the country’s population is declining and aging, implying huge challenges in the decades ahead.
帕多克今年64岁，曾经是一名会计师，没有犯罪记录，最后他被发现在饭店房间中，已经死亡，身边有23支枪，其中包括十多支突击武器。	Paddock, a 64-year-old former accountant with no criminal record, was ultimately found in his hotel room, dead, with some 23 guns, including more than ten assault weapons.
但逮捕并审判暴力领袖也许是宣告组织终结的更好的方式 — — 如果该领导人宣布放弃自己的信仰并号召追随者放下武器，恐怖组织瓦解的可能性就会增大。	But capturing and trying violent leaders is probably a better marker of the end of such organizations – the chances of such an outcome being higher when such leaders recant their views and call on their followers to lay down their arms.
同性恋早在1995年就可以注册同性公民结合，从2009年起就拥有登记结婚的权利。 而且维基解密创始人朱利安·阿桑格可以证明，瑞典也是对女权理解最为激进的国家之一。	Homosexuals have been able to register civil partnerships since 1995 and marry since 2009, and the country is one of the most radical in its understanding of women’s rights – as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange can attest.
由于中国，韩国和日本在历史上的恩怨，至今为止，东北亚经济强国之间依然还心怀芥蒂，成为世界上最后一个地区壁垒，政府之间的沟通不像东盟国家之间那样顺畅。	As a result of historical suspicion between China, Japan, and Korea, Northeast Asia’s economic heavyweights are the world’s last remaining regional bloc that still lacks an inter-governmental organization of the likes of ASEAN.
ISRO首席科学家拉德哈克里什南（K. Radhakrishnan）并不想与他国作比较 ： “ 我们是在与自己竞争 ， ” 他说 ， “ 在我们为自己所划定的领域 。 ”	The ISRO’s chief scientist, K. Radhakrishnan, is not interested in comparisons with other countries: “We are in competition with ourselves,” he declared, “in the areas we have charted for ourselves.”
尽管如此，对于最近大热的“北极圈竞赛 ” ， 虽然各主张方之间的氛围冷到了极点，但并不必担心马上会产生冲突。	Nonetheless, for all the hype about a “race for the Arctic,” and despite the rather icy atmosphere among the claimants, there is little reason to fear conflict.
不少于187个国家 — — 不管大小、是否发达 — — 在会议开始前几个月宣布了减排目标，这位达成里程碑式协定创造了势头。	No fewer than 187 countries – large and small, developed and developing – announced emissions-reduction targets in the months before the conference, which created the momentum to reach a landmark accord.
但它却被包装成抵消也是共和党提出的削减公司税的影响的应对措施 — — 公司税的削减最终有利于收入分配的顶层。	Yet it has been promoted as a way to offset the corporate-tax cuts that Republicans are also pushing – cuts that would ultimately benefit those at the top of the income distribution.
在我作为一方参与的谈判期间（1月5日—7月5日 ） ， 我反复向希腊债权人提出进行一系列明智的债务互换。	During the negotiations to which I was a party, from January 25 to July 5, I repeatedly suggested to our creditors a series of smart debt swaps.
无论领导者是否可以长期连任，将中国从一个贫穷的大型发展中国家转变为近乎一个繁荣的现代化高收入经济体的趋势不会改变。	Succession or not, there can be no turning back from a transition that has brought a large, poor developing country to the brink of prosperity as a modern, high-income economy.
显然，任何一个社会的基尼系数都落在两个极端之间，想对平等的国家如丹麦基尼系数在0.25左右，相对不平等的国家如美国和土耳其则接近0.4。	Naturally, all existing societies fall somewhere between these two extremes, with relatively egalitarian countries like Denmark at around 0.25, and less egalitarian countries like the US and Turkey closer to 0.4.
2010年，就在右翼民粹主义势力青年民主联盟党执政后不久，政府官员解雇了一批曾在竞选期间对青年民主联盟持批评态度的MTVA记者。	In 2010, not long after the right-wing populist Fidesz party came to power, government officials fired a number of MTVA journalists who had been critical of Fidesz during the election campaign.
特朗普对中国的态度在批评贸易问题和赞美习近平主席之间摇摆，他需要在强调对贸易的合理关切和避免启衅贸易战之间实现平衡。	Trump, who vacillates between tough criticism of China over trade and encomiums to President Xi Jinping, will have to balance pressing his legitimate concerns over trade with the need to avoid starting a trade war.
这两个目标被牺牲都是为了恢复超级富豪的财富，或许伴随着一种遥不可及的希望，那就是有一天这些财富会向普通民众“涓流 ” 。	Both objectives were sacrificed in the interest of restoring the fortunes of the super-rich, perhaps with a distant hope that the wealth would “trickle down” someday.
大而无当、缺陷百出的2010年多德-弗兰克立法只是一项权宜之计；尽管这部立法厚达数千页，但几乎没有严肃认识将它视为长期解决方案。	The unwieldy and deeply imperfect 2010 Dodd Frank legislation, with its thousands of pages of provisions, is a stopgap measure; few serious people view it as a long-term solution.
这种方法和当前不处理资金更困难的实体持有的流动性不足的资产所带来的威胁的做法非常不同（在当前的做法中，国家给予资本良好实体的资金更多 ） 。	This differs substantially from the current approach (in which well-capitalized entities are given even more capital), which does not deal with the overhang of illiquid assets that more distressed entities hold.
鉴于已经取得的成果和预算紧张的现状，美国已经制订了二十一世纪新的国防战略，强调灵活性、技术和力量投射。	As a result of these efforts and the reality of budget constraints, the US has developed a new defense strategy for the twenty-first century, one that emphasizes agility, technology, and force projection.
同样，就什叶派而言，他们为什么不仿效北部的库尔德人的成功模式在南部建立自己的政治架构，而却要臣服于逊尼派的霸权呢？	Similarly, why should the Shias, for their part, submit to Sunni hegemony rather than building up their own political structure in the south, modeled on what the Kurds have already achieved in the north?
如果你想了解他们的运作方式，合理的方法是从简单的小型设备着手，而后对其进行系统性分拆直到它不再履行任何功能。	If you want to understand how they work, it makes sense to start with the simplest and smallest device, then systematically carve off pieces until it stops working.
关键的考验在于他改革劳动力市场的能力，而劳动力市场僵化被广泛认为是法国经济表现相对落后的主要原因。 在过去25年时间里，法国的失业率从来就没有低于8 % 。	The crucial test will be his ability to reform the labor market, whose rigidities are widely seen as the main cause of France’s relatively poor economic performance, with an unemployment rate that has never dipped below 8% over the last 25 years.
正如我们在很多情况下所领悟到的，适应新的变化并不容易：只要对比一下法国阿尔卡特和美国朗讯合并与中海油收购雪佛龙或者米塔尔收购阿赛洛所引起的截然不同的反应，这一点就再清楚不过了。	As we know from other contexts, adjustment to newcomers is not easy: compare, say, the reaction to the tie-up between France’s Alcatel and America’s Lucent to the bids by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Chevron or Mittal for Acelor.
此外，伊朗继续偷偷摸摸地事实吞并部分伊拉克领土 — — 令人惊讶的是这种做法得到了美国的认可 — — 因为除所谓“伊斯兰国”以外没有人愿意站出来和伊朗对抗。	Meanwhile, Iran’s creeping de facto annexation of parts of Iraq – astonishingly, with American acceptance – continues because no one except the so-called “Islamic State” has the stomach to stand up to it.
一旦政府发现一个能通过这三项测试的运作契机，就更有利于它们有效地运用类似临时补贴或指定激励措施这类手段。	Once governments identify an opportunity that passes these three tests, they are in a much better position to use measures like temporary subsidies or targeted incentives effectively.
特别是，非盟以捍卫非洲民主、选举和治理宪章（African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance）的名义多次出手。	In particular, the African Union (AU) has acted repeatedly in the name of enforcing the African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance.
因此中国的未来技术选择将取决于“清洁煤”技术是否有效应用并大规模推广，而整个国家的二氧化碳减排策略在很大程度上将取决于“碳捕捉和封存”技术的早期测试成果。	China’s future choices depend on whether “clean coal” can really work effectively and on a large scale. Thus, China’s emissions path depends crucially on early testing of the CCS technologies.
但��们也不能自欺欺人地以为把现在的座驾换成普瑞斯，或把白炽灯换成节能荧光灯就能很好地应对气候变化。	But we shouldn’t fool ourselves into thinking that swapping our current car for a Prius, or replacing our incandescent lights with energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs, will strike a meaningful blow against climate change.
其中一位年轻人说他计划为小学配备更多电脑；另外一位则在塞内加尔首都达卡尔的城市混乱中建立起了联系农村求职者的网络。	One young man said he planned to put more computers into primary schools; another had set up a network to connect rural job seekers in the urban tumult of Dakar, Senegal’s capital.
长期以来，不管是在意识形态领域还是在政治联盟战略上，民主党一贯支持更多的政府开支，让更多的人民得到更多的好处。 与此相对，共和党一直拥护低税收政策。	Just as Democrats have long championed more government spending, and more benefits for more people, either on ideological grounds or as a political coalition-building strategy, so Republicans have regarded the goal of lowering taxes.
1970到1998年间，那里的小学入学率增长到90%以上，中学入学率从32%上升到75 % ， 大学教育也几乎翻番。	Between 1970 and 1998, its primary school enrollment rates grew to over 90%, secondary schooling soared from 32% to 75%, and university education doubled.
我在其他文章中指出，美国总统候选人唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）之所以能崛起，背后的许多因素与勒庞越来越受到欢迎是一样的。	As I have argued elsewhere, American presidential candidate Donald Trump owes his rise to many of the same factors that are driving Le Pen’s growing popularity.
这就意味着他将会向把他扶上权力的人负责并且依赖于他们。 这并非在某个象征的意义上，而是在履行诺言并且如果不这样做就面临制裁的实际意义上。	This means that he will be accountable to and dependent on those who raised him to power, not in a symbolic sense, but in the quite real sense of fulfilling promises and facing sanctions if he does not.
IMF预测世界GDP将在2015年之前保持4.5%的年增长率，略高于危机前十年的速度，而平均年通货膨胀率预计会有所降低，为2.9 % 。	The forecast was for world GDP to grow at about 4.5% annually until 2015, which is slightly higher than the pace during the pre-crisis decade, while the average annual inflation rate was projected to be lower, at 2.9%.
这一过程始于2009年4月，当时中国开始试点人民币贸易结算机制（RTSS ） ， 企事业单位（尤其是大型企事业单位）可以在大陆和香港之间转移资金。	That process began in April 2009, when China launched the pilot RMB Trade Settlement Scheme (RTSS), which enables enterprises, especially larger ones, to channel their funds between Mainland China and Hong Kong.
另一位著名经济学家，哈佛大学的劳伦斯·萨默斯（Lawrence Summers）则对此表示反对，认为这个故事和另一个最新趋势 — — 25-54岁的男性就业率下降 — — 无法匹配。	Another prominent economist, Harvard’s Lawrence Summers, has objected that this story is incompatible with a second recent trend, namely declining employment of men aged 25-54.
而没有一本教科书预见到欧洲合作会向危机国施加亲周期紧缩，制造出一场在一定程度上堪与20世纪30年代相提并论的萧条。	And no textbooks predicted that European cooperation would impose pro-cyclical austerity on crisis-struck countries, creating depressions that in some cases have rivaled those of the 1930s.
其一是世界舞台上的政治，一个拥有全球成就的政治人物可以大大提升欧盟的政治形象，并确保其在后危机时代的全球经济规则重塑中取得重要的发言权。	The first is the politics of world theatre, where a political figure of global stature could do much to raise the EU’s profile and ensure that it has a major say in re-ordering the post-crisis global economic rulebook.
尽管巴西人每年缴纳的税收高达GDP的37 % — —与欧洲人相当 — — 但巴西公共服务水平十分低下。	Though Brazilians pay 37% of GDP in taxes each year – about the same rate as Europeans – the quality of their public services remains very low.
今年是一战爆发一百周年纪念，回顾历史，我们一再看到，唯一可能的安全之路只有受联合国支持和各方尊重的国际法。	As we look back in this centennial year toward the outbreak of WWI, we see again and again that the only possible route to safety is international law, upheld by the United Nations and respected on all sides.
产量普遍难以糊口，到处是严重的作物减产，同时长期的全球气候变化 — — 主要是由富裕国家对能源的大量消耗造成的 — — 或许还在提高旱灾的频率和严重性。	Yields, on average, barely support survival, and crop failures are common and deadly, while long-term global climate change, caused mainly by high energy consumption in the rich countries, may be exacerbating the frequency and severity of droughts.
身为资深海洋人士，弗朗西斯在通谕Laudato Si' 中强调有必要建立严格的公海调控机制 — — 从而向削减碳排放迈出了坚实的一步 — — 这一举措令我备受鼓舞。	As an Ocean Elder, I was also heartened by Francis’s emphasis in Laudato Si' on the need for strict mechanisms of regulation and control on the open seas – a real step forward in this regard.
如果欧洲妇女在更高质量的工作中工作更长的时间，那么，这将会刺激像清洁和托儿等服务性工作，从而降低低技能工人的失业率。	If women in Europe work more hours in better quality jobs, it will stimulate demand for service jobs like cleaning and child care, thus reducing unemployment among low-skilled workers.
当我和母亲重返故土与在大屠杀中幸存的亲友团聚时，S-21(也被称为Tuol Sleng)是我们最先参观的场所之一。	When my mother and I journeyed home to reunite with relatives who had survived the genocide, S-21 (also known as Tuol Sleng) was among our first stops.
但是，鉴于该地区政府、文化、语言和宗教各异，加之东盟不干涉成员国内部事务这一中心政策，反恐合作说起来容易做起来难。	But cooperation against terror is easier said than done, given the region’s diversity of governance, culture, language, and religion, as well as ASEAN’s central policy of keeping out of non-interference in its members’ internal affairs.
但国际货币基金组织则认定尽管只需支付较低利息，希腊的再融资需求会在某个时刻超过GDP的15 ％ （ 当然这个阈值的设定过于武断 ） — —这个时刻最快可能在15年后到来。	The IMF, however, argues that, despite these low interest payments, the refinancing needs of Greece will surpass 15% of GDP (an arbitrary threshold, to be sure) at some point – perhaps as soon as 15 years.
与少数民族叛军的和平谈判取得了进展 — — 此类冲突的根源可以追溯到殖民地时期的分割统治策略，在独立后的60余年里，缅甸统治者也延续了这一策略。	Progress has been made on peace agreements with ethnic-minority insurgents – conflicts rooted in the divide-and-rule strategy of colonialism, which the country’s post-independence rulers maintained for more than six decades.
纽约—欧盟需要接受共同庇护政策缺位的责任。 共同庇护政策的缺位导致今年不断增加的难民流入从一个可管理的问题演变为又一场政治危机。	NEW YORK – The European Union needs to accept responsibility for the lack of a common asylum policy, which has transformed this year’s growing influx of refugees from a manageable problem into yet another political crisis.
美国应当作出保证它不会利用朝鲜重新统一谋取战略优势，同时警示中国朝鲜目前的做法对其自身利益所构成的威胁。	The US should offer some reassurances that it would not exploit Korea’s reunification for strategic advantage, while warning China of the dangers North Korea’s current path poses to its own interests.
当国际社会的目光还停留在达尔富尔、索马里和津巴布韦的问题之上时，加纳、坦桑尼亚，莫桑比克和利比里亚等一批非洲国家的经济形势已经悄悄发生了逆转。	While international attention has been understandably focused on events in Darfur, Somalia and Zimbabwe, countries across the continent including Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique and Liberia have been quietly turning their economies around.
俄罗斯的外交政策主要关注其国有公司的利益，特别是Gazprom。 这家公司和许多国家和外国公司达成了垄断供应的协定。	Russia’s foreign policy is focused on the interests of its state-dominated corporations, notably Gazprom, which has concluded agreements with many foreign countries and companies for monopolistic deliveries.
危机肇始时，人们还没想到欧元有可能会崩溃：以共同货币计价的资产和债务你中有我，我中有你，欧元的崩溃会造成不可控制的大灾难。	At the onset of the crisis, a breakup of the euro was inconceivable: the assets and liabilities denominated in a common currency were so intermingled that a breakup would have led to an uncontrollable meltdown.
其中的假设是，如果新闻机构只报道“事实 ” ， 读者和评论者就永远能够从他们获得的故事中得出正确的结论。	The assumption is that if news outlets were to report only the “facts,” readers and viewers would always reach the right conclusion about a given story.
2011年底，中央政府净资产为87万亿人民币，占GDP的192 % ， 其中33万亿为国有企业的股本。	At the end of 2011, the central government’s net assets amounted to CN¥87 trillion ($14 trillion), or 192% of GDP, of which CN¥33 trillion comprised equity in state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
这堪称一场正在酝酿的悲剧，因为各方其实可以从已达成的谈判共识中获取可观的收益，并将成为全球经济的重要推动力。	This is a tragedy in the making, because the gains available from what has already been agreed upon in the negotiations are considerable, and would provide a major boost to the global economy.
发自堪培拉 — — 美国在本月早些时候对伊朗实施的制裁目的在于在经济上孤立该国，并迫使政权更替或大幅转变其行为。	CANBERRA – The sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States earlier this month are designed to isolate the country economically, and to force either regime change or a dramatic shift in the regime’s behavior.
其结果是，劳动力总和收入 — — 工作岗位数乘以工作小时数乘以每小时平均工资 — — 下降的幅度很大。	As a result, total labor income – the product of jobs times hours worked times average hourly wages – has fallen dramatically.
欧洲能否在国际事务中促进公平竞争？ 还是不得不承认新的大国竞争游戏不可避免，然后也投身到这场喧嚣之中？	Can Europe promote fair play in international affairs, or must it accept a new game of great power rivalry as inevitable and throw itself into the fray?
被称为“亲爱的领袖”的金正日（也就是“伟大领袖”金日成的儿子）将冬天变成了春天，并被天堂里一颗明亮的星星所照耀。	The birth of Kim Jong-il, also known as the Dear Leader (his father, Kim Il-sung, was the Great Leader), turned winter into spring and was illuminated by a bright star in heaven.
具有讽刺意味的是，塞尔维亚对阿赫蒂萨里计划的拒绝削弱了对生活在科索沃的塞族人的保护，并且增加了他们遭到虐待的危险。	Ironically, Serbia’s resistance to the Ahtisaari plan undermines protection for Kosovo’s Serbs and increases the risk that they will be mistreated.
毕竟，在痛苦的去杠杆过程中（即减少开支、增加储蓄以降低债务 ） ， 国内私人和公共需求将受到抑制，重塑增长的唯一希望是贸易平衡的改善，而这要求欧元大幅贬值。	After all, with painful deleveraging – spending less and saving more to reduce debts – depressing domestic private and public demand, the only hope of restoring growth is an improvement in the trade balance, which requires a much weaker euro.
其他中国官员也在此问题上大做文章，暗示中国纪念二战结束70周年的仪式将排除日本 — — 除非日本就其历史罪行做出忏悔。	Other Chinese officials have picked up the theme, dropping hints that China’s 70th anniversary celebration of the end of World War II could exclude Japan – unless, that is, Japan is more contrite about its historic transgressions.
相反，我们的观点（在大量数据支持下）认为价格的快速上升通常意味着非理性繁荣，而且是由钓鱼行为所助力和唆使的。	By contrast, our view (supported by plenty of data) is that rapidly rising prices usually reflect irrational exuberance, aided and abetted by phishes.
上个月，奥斯本的继任者菲利普·哈蒙德（Phillip Hammond）表示他将签署390亿英镑资金支持北方强区铁路项目。	Crucially, what came to be called the northern powerhouse model was designed in such a way as to complement London, rather than undercut it through competition.
缺少利润并不会削弱校友主导的董事会通过聘任杰出教员、录取杰出学生、争夺体育和艺术荣誉等方式竞争社会地位的动力。	The lack of profit does not diminish an alumni-dominated board’s incentive to compete for prestige by, for example, hiring distinguished faculty, accepting meritorious students, and striving for athletic or artistic achievement.
在这样一场至关重要的辩论中，所提供的信息质量尤为关键，那些反对干细胞研究的人一定会避免一场将迫使他们面对科学辩论的公众讨论。	In such a crucially important debate, the quality of the information offered is paramount, and it is no coincidence that those who oppose stem cell research prefer to avoid a public debate that would force them to confront scientific arguments.
与3年前相同，中国首当其冲，其年出口增长率从2010年10月的31%下降到了2011年10月的16 % ， 未来数月可能进一步下降。	As was the case three years ago, China is leading the way, with annual export growth plummeting in October 2011, to 16%, from 31% in October 2010 – and likely to slow further in coming months.
按照目前水平，国家航空航天局可能无法完成下一个十年的任务，即使这样的测绘对于防止小行星撞击地球而言是关键因素，因为测绘可以给我们好几年的预警时间。	At the current rate, NASA may not complete the task for another decade, even though such mapping is the key to an asteroid defense because it may give us years of warning.
社会科学家 — — 特别是经济学家 — — 使用简单的概念框架 — — 他们口中的“模型 ” — —来分析世界。	Social scientists – and economists in particular – analyze the world using simple conceptual frameworks that they call “models.”
形形色色经济和政治体制国家的决策者正在参与解决细菌耐药性上升问题，其中某些国家已经在采取针对性措施。	Policymakers from countries with a wide variety of economic and political systems are engaging on the AMR problem, with some countries already taking steps to tackle it.
因此，IMF认为大部分发达国家步调一致地采取过度前瞻的财政紧缩将恶化2013年的全球增长前景是完全正确的。	The International Monetary Fund is thus absolutely right in arguing that excessively front-loaded and synchronized fiscal austerity in most advanced economies will dim global growth prospects in 2013.
而服务提供者也应该意识到，正如任何关系那样，用户也希望他们之间的关系能实现纯净透明，互相尊重和互相认可。	Service providers should understand that their users will expect the transparency, respect, and recognition that are fundamental to any relationship.
20世纪90年代初，美国就考虑对尚处于萌芽状态的朝鲜核计划予以军事摧毁，但因为担心引发第二次朝鲜战争而作罢。	In the early 1990s, the US considered using military force to nip the North Korean program in the bud, but held off for fear of triggering a second Korean War.
政府同时还要关注那些私人企业在有竞争力的新产品方面所取得的进展，并支持私人部门不断增大在新产业中创新成果的比例。	The government should also pay attention to the development by private enterprises of new and competitive products, and support the scaling up of successful private-sector innovations in new industries.
正在实施的包含了一系列雄心勃勃的宏观经济、法制和宪法改革方案的“肯尼亚2030年远景框架”就是在与世界银行密切合作下进行的。	The “Kenya vision 2030 framework,” a set of ambitious macroeconomic, legal, and constitutional reforms, was being implemented in close partnership with the World Bank.
尤其重要的是将国有企业利润 — — 目前接近4 000亿美元 — — 的30%用于资金严重不足的社会安全网。	Especially important is the proposal to channel 30% of the profits of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) – currently running at close to $400 billion – into the country’s woefully under-funded social safety net.
比如 ， 《 1995年东南亚无核区条约》成立了委员会，在“无法形成共识”的情况下，可以按照三分之二多数原则决策。	For example, the 1995 Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone established a commission that, “failing consensus,” can make decisions by a two-thirds majority.
举例来说讲，几乎在1979年实行独生子女政策的同时，中国的储蓄也开始增长，储蓄的增长防止了在1966－1976年文化大革命后人口的大幅反弹。	For example, the uptrend in saving in China began at around the same time as its one-child policy was implemented in 1979. This prevented the birth rate from rebounding after the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76.
前南国际刑事法庭的使命一如既往，是有效和重要的。 那就是表明，犯下人类社会中最严重的罪行后可以逍遥法外的时代正在终结。	The ICTY’s mission is as valid and as vital as ever: to show that the era of impunity for some of humanity’s worst crimes is coming to an end.
哥本哈根共识中心研究了最佳研发机会，结果刚刚由英国智库政策交流中心（Policy Exchange）发布。	The Copenhagen Consensus has studied the best R&D opportunities, and the results have just been published by the British Policy Exchange think tank.
“绝大部分美国人连给司法部长打个电话都做不到 ， ” 凯勒赫提醒我们 ， “ 更不用说找到他、要他停止提起将把摩根大通被控非法行为的细节公诸于众的诉讼了 。 ”	“Few if any Americans have the ability to even get the AG on the phone,” Kelleher reminds us, “much less the power to get him to stop him from filing a lawsuit that would have revealed to the public the details of JPMorgan’s alleged illegal conduct.”
上述经历的共同之处在于它们往往是出于提高生活水平的愿望，无论是通过获得更有声望的职位、更高的薪酬亦或是人身安全的增加。	What these experiences do have in common is they are generally driven by a desire to raise one’s living standards, whether through a more prestigious position, a higher salary, or increased physical safety.
与此同时，巴沙尔的支持者，特别是少数教派阿拉维（Alawite ） ， 必然会担心一旦他倒台就会遭到大屠杀。	At the same time, Assad’s loyalists, especially members of the minority Alawite sect, must fear that they would be massacred if his regime fell.
但在毫无意义的极端和平主义和超过道德边界的战争之间存在一个可以尝试让毫无争议的战争残酷性最小化的中间地带。	But between the untenable extremes of pacifism and the elevation of war to something beyond morality, there is a middle ground that seeks to minimize the unquestionable evil of war.
但是，在中国经济和地缘政治崛起的同时，美国似乎在竭尽全力浪费其所拥有的经济、科技和地缘政治优势，这着实令人惊讶。	Still, it is striking that just as China is rising economically and geopolitically, the US seems to be doing everything possible to waste its own economic, technological, and geopolitical advantages.
大西洋这边对三位剩下的侯选人的人格和智力素质难免有点嫉妒。 人们可以听到这样的话 ： “ 我们能不能只借一个侯选人呢 ？ ”	The human and intellectual qualities of the three remaining candidates are even viewed with some envy on this side of the Atlantic, where you can hear statements such as: “Could we borrow just one of your candidates?”
之前，穆尔西提供了一个平台，排除基督徒从事政治生活以及授予伊斯兰学者监督权，这确保了所有的立法均符合伊斯兰教教法。	In the past, Morsi advocated a platform that excluded Christians from political life and granted Islamic scholars oversight authority to ensure that all legislation complied with Sharia law.
通过狡猾地运用影射性字句和身体语言去在塞族人中鼓动一种受害者情绪，米洛舍维堪称欧洲近几代人中最能蛊惑人心的民族主义者。	With his crafty use of code words and body language to encourage a sense of victimhood among Serbs, Milošević was one of the most demagogic nationalists Europe had seen in generations.
越来越多的投资者正在寻找负责任的投资或“影响力投资 ” （ impact investment，兼顾财务和社会回报）的机会。	A growing number of investors are looking for responsible investment or “impact investment” opportunities that promise a mix of both financial and social returns.
罹患高风险癌症并接受高剂量化疗的儿童在治疗期间有超过80%概率会遭受一次以上危及生命或致命的严重药物毒性损伤。	Children with high-risk cancers who receive dose-intensive chemotherapy have a greater than 80% chance of experiencing at least one severe, life-threatening, or fatal drug-related toxic event over the course of their treatment.
该卫星发射计划在金正日时代就已开始谋划，显然，该计划是为了给缺少军队经验的新领导人提供“威武”的军事成就。	The decision to launch the satellite, which had been planned by Kim Jong-il, is clearly intended to provide a “heroic” martial achievement for a new leader who lacks any military experience.
目前，民粹主义不满的政治 — — 从唐纳德·特朗普的总统选战到英国可能退出欧盟 — — 正在吸引全世界的关注。	For now, the politics of populist discontent – from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to the potential of a British exit from the European Union – are capturing the world’s attention.
最近，这场冲突决定着叙利亚内战的进程，伊朗支持代表什叶派伊斯兰教中的阿拉维派的总统巴沙尔·阿萨德，而沙特支持反阿萨德的逊尼派力量。	More recently, it has shaped the course of Syria’s civil war, in which Iran backs President Bashar al-Assad, who represents the Alawite sect of Shia Islam, while the Saudis are supporting anti-Assad Sunni forces.
好消息是德国正在着手于将过于庞大的混合联合企业削减至有效规模，以使得资本市场能有效运作并能改善资源分布。	The good news is that Germany’s overblown conglomerates are being scaled down to an efficient size and that the capital market is able to do its job, improving the allocation of resources.
尽管推测起来非常容易，但奥巴马合作的政策态度向特朗普更极端的策略转变可能对地区稳定造成何种影响仍然有待于观察。	It remains to be seen how the turn from Obama’s collaborative policy approach to Trump’s more polarizing tactics might affect regional stability, though it is easy enough to speculate.
但同时，许多世界上真正贫穷的国家变得更为落后（特别是在发展常常被形容为灾难的非洲 ） ， 并且大多数国家内部的不平衡变得更为严重。	But, at the same time, many of the world’s truly poor countries have fallen further behind (particularly in Africa, where developments are often described as catastrophic), and inequality within most countries has risen.
在我们叛逆的年龄段，很多人会对这一陈腐的校训嗤之以鼻（事实上，也许是对任何校训或口号都会如此 ） 。	In our cynical age, many might scoff at such an old-fashioned motto (or, indeed, at the power of any motto or slogan).
据联合俄国贸易和发展会议（Conference on Trade and Development）的数据，跨国公司 — — 它们占发展中国家潜在公司税基的三分之一 — — 的BEPS行为导致的每年损失高达1,000亿美元。	According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, such activities by multinationals – which represent one-third of the potential corporate-tax base in developing countries – result in annual losses of $100 billion.
明年1月伊拉克大选的可能性肯定到不了50 % ， 而且我们可以认定，这绝不会是自由、公正的全国性大选。	The probability of Iraqi elections being held this coming January must be lower than 50%, and we can be certain that these will not be free and fair elections throughout the entire country.
阿齐兹的财富大概有2700亿美元，死前就分配给了各位儿子，以便巩固他们在激烈的王子竞争中的政治地位。	Sultan’s fortune is estimated at $270 billion, which he distributed between his sons prior to his death in order to shore up their political position in the competitive princely arena.
如果它们成为欧洲政策的指导方针，那么欧洲的经济将会变得僵化、停滞不前，从而无法支付即使是温和程度的社会资金转移。	If they came to be accepted as the guiding principles of European policy, Europe’s economy would become petrified, with stagnant growth making it impossible to afford even modest levels of social transfers.
即使上限仅适用于“分项扣减 ” （ itemized deduction）和医保豁免，也仍然能够在第一年筹集2 500亿美元，并在此后的第一个十年里筹集3万亿美元。	Even if the cap were applied only to “itemized deductions” and the health-insurance exclusion, it would raise about $250 billion in the first year and about $3 trillion over the first decade.
如果美国在实行二级制裁方面太过激进，那么其他国家可能要么研发自身的支付系统，要么禁止其国内公司进一步与美国公司开展业务。	If the US is too aggressive in its enforcement of secondary sanctions, other countries might either develop payment systems of their own or forbid their companies from doing further business with US firms.
此后我迎来了灿烂的人生，但右手残疾时刻提醒着我消灭小儿麻痹症、确保所有儿童都能获得他们所需要的疫苗是一项无比紧迫的任务。	I have gone on to live a wonderful life, but the paralysis in my hand is a daily reminder of why we must urgently pursue the eradication of polio and ensure that all children have access to the vaccines that they need.
但是那些引领一个经济体的人应该把重点放在评估结果和分配模式上，而不是关注一个永远无法彻底解决的难题。	But those guiding an economy should focus on assessing outcomes and modes of distribution rather than on a puzzle that will never fully be solved.
本笃十六世还引用了法国首席大拉比Gilles Bernheim的话，后者表达了类似的传统家庭生活受到了威胁的观点。	Tellingly, Benedict quoted Gilles Bernheim, the Chief Rabbi of France, who has expressed similar views on the threats to conventional family life.
在寻找预测石油价格更完美方式的过程中，我从几年前开始注意五年远期石油价格与布伦特原油现货价格，即今天每桶石油价格的对比。	In my ongoing quest to become better at forecasting, I began, a few years ago, to pay attention to the five-year forward oil price as it compares to the Brent crude oil spot price, the price of a barrel of oil today.
此外，人民币真实价值（经通胀调整）正在快速上升，这主要是由中国通胀差异和中国工资增长（特别是其出口部门）引起的。	Moreover, the real (inflation-adjusted) value of the renminbi is now rising quickly, owing to inflation differentials and Chinese wage growth, particularly in the country’s export sectors.
他们声称美国经常项目赤字（或贸易赤字）是德国/中国这两个经常项目盈余国玩弄不公平贸易手段的表现 — — 但这其实是美国储蓄率低下且不断下降的结果。	They claim that America’s current-account deficit (or trade deficit), which is in fact the result of America’s low and falling saving rate, is an indicator of unfair trade practices by Germany and China, two current-account surplus countries.
最近，我和路易斯维尔大学的罗纳德·阿特拉斯教授一起向《科学》杂志递交了一份题为《生命科学的伦理规范》的提案。	Professor Ronald Atlas of the University of Louisville and I recently presented a proposed Code of Ethics for the Life Sciences in the journal Science .
随着国际干细胞公司（ISCC）在欧洲为一项激活未受精卵细胞单性生殖制造干细胞株的技术申请专利，现在已经是时候回答这个问题。	With the International Stem Cell Corporation (ISCC) seeking patents in Europe for a technology that produces stem cell lines from the parthenogenetic activation of an unfertilized ovum, the time has come to answer that question.
美国、国际社会和世界银行自身一再强调改善治理的重要性，但行长任命权实际归属美国总统这一事实让这一切看上去颇为可笑。	While the US, the international community, and the Bank itself repeatedly emphasize the importance of good governance, a selection procedure that de facto leaves the appointment to the US president makes a mockery of it.
与此同时，欧盟几十年来的不断扩张也吸引进了其他有力的竞争者，主要是西班牙和英国，以及那些不愿意在法-德领导下俯首称臣的小国家。	At the same time, successive EU enlargements over the decades have brought in other powerful contenders, chiefly Spain and the UK, as well as smaller countries who are unwilling to bow before French-German leadership.
此外，希腊总理齐普拉斯和前南斯拉夫马其顿共和国（FYROM）总理扎伊夫举行了两国七年来首次总理级会晤。	Moreover, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and the prime minister of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Zoran Zaev, held the first prime-ministerial-level meeting between their two countries in seven years.
公共债务也依然太高，更加糟糕的是，相比以前，如今多得多的部分持有在官方而不是私人债权人手中（这会导致不得不进行债务重组时局面更加混乱 ） 。	Public debt remains too high as well, and, making matters worse, much more of it is now owed to official rather than private creditors (which would complicate debt restructuring should it become necessary).
通过接受这类学校所代表的隔离主义的观念，英国人现在在说的是 ： “ 这是你的身份，你不能再有其他身份了 。 ”	By embracing the kind of separatism that such schools represent, the British are now saying, “This is your identity and you can have nothing else.”
这意味着需要改变目前政府预算赤字下降的趋势。 中国预算赤字从2013年占GDP的2%下降到去年的1.8 % 。	This would mean reversing the recent decline in the government budget deficit, which narrowed to 1.8% last year, from 2% of GDP in 2013.
投资规模从2000年占GDP的22.3%下降到2013年的17 % ， 包括高速公路，桥梁甚至基尔运河这样的基础设施项目都在遭到数年的冷落后最终下马。	Investment has fallen from 22.3% of GDP in 2000 to 17% in 2013. Infrastructure, such as highways, bridges, and even the Kiel Canal, is crumbling after years of neglect.
经历了足够的分裂活动，目睹着仇恨步步累积，一个国家就这样变成了一个满目疮痍的社会，其所拥有的仅仅是一个地理领土范围。	Arm some of these manufactured minority structures so that they can demand autonomy at the barrel of a gun, and you get the kind of chaos the Kremlin can use to reassert its control.
阿拉伯人对民主的偏好较低（差距为11 % ） ，公民活跃程度较低（差距8 % ） ，更尊重威权（差距11 % ） ，也更强烈地接受父权价值（差距为惊人的30 % ） 。	Arabs have a lower preference for democracy (with a gap of 11%), are less civically active (a gap of 8%), respect authority more (by 11%), and embrace patriarchal values much more strongly (by a whopping 30%).
此外日本自1990年代以来的持续通货紧缩不是业已证明，通货紧缩不会因为货币扩张政策或者财政赤字而得到逆转吗？	And doesn’t Japan’s persistent deflation since the early 1990’s also show that, once it begins, deflation cannot be reversed by a policy of easy money or fiscal deficits?
从最低程度上说，当俄罗斯再次被视为欧洲的威胁的情况下，美国人不会欢迎和苏格兰领导人就在苏格兰部署核武器和潜艇的问题进行艰难的争议性公共争论。	To say the least, Americans would not welcome a difficult, controversial public debate with Scotland’s leaders over the stationing of nuclear weapons and submarines on their territory at a time when Russia is again seen as a threat to Europe.
在美国考虑对中国发动核打击时，澳大利亚总理罗伯特·孟席斯悄悄对美国总统艾森豪威尔说 ， “ 如果目的是争夺台湾，这场战争和我们无关，只是你们自己的问题 。 ”	As the US contemplated a possible nuclear attack on China, Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies quietly told US President Dwight Eisenhower, “If there is a war over Taiwan, it is your affair and not ours.”
以色列外长利伯曼（Avigdor Lieberman）建议废除1993年9月与巴勒斯坦解放组织签署的奥斯陆协议（巴勒斯坦权力机构正是根据该协议于1994年成立的 ） 。	Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman suggested canceling the Oslo Accords, signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization in September 1993, which provided the basis for the creation of the Palestinian Authority in 1994.
归根结底，是白人企业精英，而非贫困的非洲裔、西班牙裔和其他少数族裔美国人剥夺了工薪阶层白人享有优质公共教育、廉价医疗和环境安全的权利。	It is, after all, white corporate elites, not poor African-Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities, who deprive working-class whites of quality public schools, affordable health care, and environmental safety.
今天，当各国领导人思考后2015年发展计划时，宽带作为实现未来目标所需基础设施的重要性已经不容忽视。	Today, as world leaders consider the post-2015 development agenda, we cannot overlook the importance of including broadband as a key part of the infrastructure needed to achieve future goals.
朱棣文和骆家辉深知，中美两国目前是世界上最大的温室气体排放国家。 如果要解决这个问题，两国必须找到一个合作的方法。	Both Chu and Locke are aware that the US and China are now the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, and that, if there is any hope of remedying global climate change, the two countries must quickly find a way to collaborate.
一份2014年的报告指出 ： “ [存在背叛者这一事实]打破了团结的形象，也打破了[该集团]试图展现的决心 。 ”	As a 2014 report states, “[the very existence of defectors] shatters the image of unity and determination that [the group] seeks to convey.”
韩日曾是历史上的死敌，而今作为美国的两大盟友，它们提升了双边安全关系。 中国和俄罗斯都担心，一个如同“小北约”的、紧密的美日韩三边同盟将出现在两国的东翼。	But as the two US allies, who were once bitter enemies, improve their bilateral security relationship, China and Russia both fear that a close US-Japan-South Korea alliance could emerge as the equivalent of a mini-NATO to their east.
从乌克兰到希腊的一系列事件让欧洲大陆从受尽煎熬到面对熊熊战火，期间伴随着连绵不断的首脑会议、正式宣言和边缘政策。	From Ukraine to Greece, events have led the continent from the frying pan to the fire and back again, with all of the attendant summitry, declarations, and brinkmanship.
安理会承认解决问题的最佳途径是实现西撒哈拉去殖民化，保护人权，确保撒哈拉民众拥有自决权并为该地区实现长期稳定奠定基础。	The Security Council recognizes that this is the best route to achieving decolonization in Western Sahara, protecting human rights, enabling self-determination by the Saharawi people, and setting the stage for long-term stability in the territory.
比如，埃塞俄比��等国家不应该大量投资于地区一体化所需要的基础设施，投资于建设工业园并用公路将它们与吉布提的港口连接起来效果更好。	For example, instead of investing heavily in the infrastructure needed for regional integration, a country like Ethiopia would be better off building industrial parks and linking them by road to ports in Djibouti.
结果，欧元区目前存在近3.5%的盈余，尽管 — — 可能也是因为 — — 多年来地中海成员内需萎靡。	As a result, the eurozone now has a surplus close to 3.5%, despite, and probably because of, years of weak domestic demand in the Mediterranean member states.
倘若我们不在真正权力归属的问题上自欺欺人，那么就让总统们和议会们多如牛毛吧，如果那样能让人们觉得舒服的话。	Provided we do not deceive ourselves about where real power lies, let presidents and parliaments be three a penny if that is what makes people feel good about themselves.
近期非洲通信部门的繁荣 — — 这带来了整个工业的革命，更不用说人们的生活方式了 — — 说明了这一方法可以有多大的效果。	The recent boom in Africa’s telecommunications sector – which has revolutionized entire industries, not to mention people’s lifestyles – demonstrates just how effective such an approach can be.
但事无巨细的艰难谈判进行了十年 — — 并且同时花了巨大的力气强化欧盟外部边界 — — 才在1995年实现基本取消内部边境控制。	But it took another decade of hard-nosed, detailed negotiations, entailing efforts to strengthen the EU’s external borders, to reach the point, in 1995, where internal border controls could actually be lifted.
现在，这位年轻的独立候选人真的可能在5月7日举行的总统选举中当选，并因此彻底破坏第五共和国的政治制度。	Now, there is a real chance the young independent could be elected president on May 7, upending the Fifth Republic’s political system.
避免这一结果需要加强对2015年巴黎气候协定等多边条约的支持，而因为美国的退出，巴黎协定受到了削弱。	Avoiding such outcomes will require renewed support for multilateral treaties such as the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which has been weakened by the withdrawal of the United States.
这场持续 5 天的网上讨论将包含 10 个主题，从人权到海盗问题，危机准备，气候变化，发展以及冲突防止问题。	The five-day Internet debate will include 10 topics, ranging from human rights to piracy, from crisis preparedness to climate change, and from development to conflict prevention.
中国专注于这些目标已有五年 — — 试图将强大但失衡的、主要基于出口和投资的模式转变为日益由其消费者驱动的模式。	China has been focused on these objectives for five years – seeking to transform a powerful yet unbalanced growth model based largely on exports and investment into one driven increasingly by its consumers.
发自东京 — — 无论是全球经济向亚洲倾斜的不断倾斜，还是中国作为一个超级大国的日益崛起 — — 这可是我们时代的核心历史事件，将带领全球事务走向可见的未来 — — 都没能吸引美国的目光。	TOKYO – Despite the relentless shift of global economic might to Asia, and China’s rise as a great power – the central historical events of our time, which will drive world affairs for the foreseeable future – America’s focus has been elsewhere.
中国目前仍然遵守国际规则，但却不断告诉世界它希望在亚洲平等国家中拥有首席地位（长期以来美国在美洲就拥有这样的地位 ） 。	China is currently playing by the international rules but is increasingly signaling that it expects to be treated as first among equals in the region (as the US has long insisted with respect to its position in the Americas).
如果这是真的话，这个针对嘎玛桑珠的事件就意味着西藏当地官员的权力正不断膨胀，甚至能超出自己的管辖范围去处理一些显然属于私人恩怨的问题。	If it is true, the case against Karma suggests that officials stationed in Tibetan areas may be gaining more power, able to reach out beyond their jurisdictions to pursue what appear to be little more than personal grievances.
。 边沁所谓的“就业”是指政府支出，他认为这之所以是一个谬误，原因在于一边倒地反对增加政府支出没有考虑到增加的雇员所能带来的好处。	By “jobs,” he meant government spending, and he considered this a fallacy because blanket opposition to more government spending fails to take into account the good that the extra employees will be able to achieve.
日内瓦—尽管俄罗斯中央银行上个月实施了半夜加息的紧急措施，但卢布看似绝望的急剧贬值仍唤起了1998年俄罗斯经济崩溃的幽灵。	GENEVA – The rapid depreciation of the ruble, despite a dramatic – and seemingly desperate – late-night interest-rate hike by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) last month, has raised the specter of Russia’s economic meltdown in 1998.
同样，尽管为达成一项富国和穷国都可以接受的全球性协议还任重而道远，但是包括中国和印度在内的主要发展中国家似乎也不再不愿同意一项规划。	Likewise, the unwillingness of major developing countries such as China and India to sign on to a plan also seems to be ending, though considerable work remains to craft a global agreement to which both rich and poor countries can agree.
政治上的问题在于，第二种解决方案尚得不到德国选民的支持，更不用说法国国民阵线和芬兰纯正芬兰人党（True Finns）这样的民族主义党派了。	The political problem is that the second solution cannot yet be sold to German voters, let alone to nationalist fringe parties like France’s National Front and Finland’s True Finns.
严重的不平等性让我们产生比平常更渴求的物质欲望，因为我们时时刻刻都会认为我们比相邻的家伙拥有得更少。	Great inequality makes us hungrier for goods than we would otherwise be, by constantly reminding us that we have less than the next person.
克里米亚鞑靼人根本不关注法西斯主义者统治乌克兰的海外奇谈；他们还记得父辈和祖父辈所遭遇的大规模野蛮凶残的大驱逐，下令的是斯大林，执行的是NKVD。	Crimean Tatars pay no heed to the fairy tales about fascists ruling Ukraine; they can still remember the brutal and murderous mass deportations of their parents and grandparents, ordered by Stalin and carried out by the NKVD.
虽然这一点值得注意，但大背景是因为更多二氧化碳为植被提供营养，气候变化导致世界自1982年来实际增加了相当于一整块大陆的绿色物质（各类植物 ） 。	But while this deserves attention, the bigger story is that, because more carbon dioxide fertilizes vegetation, climate change has actually increased the world’s green matter (plants of all sorts) since 1982 by the equivalent of an entire continent.
马歇尔计划的设计师查尔斯·金德尔伯格（Charles Kindleberger）认为20世纪30年代国际秩序的崩溃是因为美国没有提供与其世界主宰性强国的地缘政治地位相符的全球公共品。	Charles Kindleberger, an architect of the Marshall Plan, blamed the breakdown of the international order in the 1930s on America’s failure to match its provision of global public goods to its new geopolitical status as the world’s dominant power.
那一天的压轴表演是古典音乐会及随后的庄严的火花。 音乐会堪称法国版伦敦逍遥音乐会（Proms in London ） ， 结合了轻古典乐和流行歌曲。	The classical concert that preceded the magisterial fireworks that ended the day was the closest thing to a French version of the Proms in London, mixing light classical and popular songs.
共和党众议员援引胡佛研究所学者的研究结论，认为修改破产法 — — 创建所谓的第14章 — — 可以令这些企业在不产生负面系统性后果的情况下实施破产。	House Republicans, drawing on work by scholars at the Hoover Institution, have argued that modifying the bankruptcy code – creating a so-called Chapter 14 – would allow such firms to fail without the risk of adverse systemic consequences.
事实上正如我们所见，在美国卫生和人类服务部生物医学高级研发管理局以及威康信托基金(Wellcome Trust)的大力资助下，在这方面已经取得了长足的发展。	And, as it happens, this is an area where there has been genuine progress, thanks largely to financing from the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Wellcome Trust.
以色列仍在约旦河西岸不断地建设定居点，这使得阿巴斯及其同事愈加认定靠谈判无法达成建设性成果，只能寄希望于联合国一地两国的解决方案了。	And Israel’s continuing settlement construction on the West Bank has sharpened their sense that negotiations would not be productive, whereas the raft of UN resolutions supporting a two-state solution could now be put to the test.
在2003年早些时候，与布什当局的说法相反的是，其在伊拉克的现场检查员确认萨达姆并没有核子武器项目。	In early 2003, its onsite presence in Iraq established that Saddam did not have a nuclear weapons program, contrary to the Bush administration’s representations.
针锋相对之下，中国威胁对美国106种出口产品（包括大豆，汽车和飞机）加征25％关税，一旦美国关税生效就立刻执行。	In response, China threatened 25% tariffs on 106 US exports (including soybeans, cars, and airplanes), to go into effect whenever the US tariffs do.
确保“滴渗”财富渗透得更快的唯一办法是进一步降低边际税率，或者改善穷人的“人力资本 ” ， 从而增加他们对雇主的价值。	The only secure way to get “trickle-down” wealth to trickle faster is by cutting marginal tax rates still further, or, alternatively, by improving the “human capital” of the poor, so that they become worth more to their employers.
为了制造这样一种“治疗仪 ” ， 至少需要一项深远的创新：为整个系统建模的更加方法，该方法必须能为生物学和计算机科学带来新概念工具。	In order to build a “curing machine” of this kind, at least one far-reaching innovation is needed: a better way of modeling entire systems, which would deliver new conceptual tools to both biology and computer science.
越来越高涨的“愤怒”背后的联系因素是对存在于现实和想象中的不平等现象的抗拒 — — 其中包括待遇和经济条件上的不平等。	The unifying factor behind this rising “anger” is rejection of both real and perceived inequality – inequality in both treatment and economic conditions.
后来，奥托曼土耳其数百年来被视为“欧洲音乐会”的一部分，并且在确定和确保欧洲大陆列强战略平衡中不可或缺。	Later, Ottoman Turkey was for centuries considered a part of the “concert of Europe,” proving indispensable in defining and securing the strategic balance among the European continent’s Great Powers.
特朗普更喜欢自由的会面，而会面所产生的书面结果可以非常模糊（如新加坡）或根本不存在（如赫尔辛基 ） 。	Trump prefers free-flowing sessions in which the written outcome can be vague, as it was in Singapore, or non-existent, as it was in Helsinki.
这些运动并不是2001年9月11日以后在美国或者欧洲产生的，而且他们不会等候、依赖美国或者欧盟来采取行动。	These movements were not created in the US or Europe after September 11, 2001, and they will not wait for or depend on the US or the EU to act.
政府拒绝服从，然后，5万人走向了充满传奇色彩的伊斯兰堡主干道（Grand Trunk Road ） ， 在36个小时内完成了300公里长征。	When the government did not oblige, 50,000 people set out on the fabled Grand Trunk Road to Islamabad, taking 36 hours to complete the 300-kilometer trek.
捕捞压力的大幅减轻给了遭受毁灭性打击的鱼类种群以喘息之机，事故发生5年后，人们必需仔细观察才能发现残留的原油和对鱼群的影响。	The dramatic reduction in fishing pressure allowed the devastated populations to recover, and five years later one had to look carefully to spot either remaining oil or damaged populations.
我们已经可以看到机器人带来的影响 — — 不仅局限于汽车业 — — 机器人能够胜任曾经需要数千中等收入流水线工人来完成的工作。	We have already seen the impact – not least in the car industry – of robots that can carry out the routine jobs that were once performed by thousands of middle-income assembly-line workers.
我们呼吁把资源投入到在当地儿童出生的头1000天内进行的针对性干预措施上；而一个更具前景的进展是，我们的研究被纳入了孟加拉国的《第二次国家营养行动计划》中。	We called for more investments in targeted interventions that reach children in their first 1,000 days; and in a promising development, our research factored into Bangladesh’s Second National Plan of Action for Nutrition.
主流经济学家往往将合约网络系统视作理所当然的，以至于几乎对其视而不见。 合约网络界定了市场体系内的正式与非正式规则，同时塑造并约束了个人及社会行为。	This web of contracts – often taken for granted in mainstream economics, to the extent that it becomes almost invisible – embodies the formal and informal rules embedded in the market system that shape and constrain individual and social behavior.
在2008年获选总统的任何人所面临的问题都将是寻求推进民主价值观的适当的现实主义途径并对官方论调做出相应调整。	The problem for whoever is elected president in 2008 will be to find appropriate realistic means to advance democratic values and adjust official rhetoric accordingly.
但同时也需要有效地与美国人民沟通，让他们知道与中国的关系兹事体大，不能出现差错，因此必须有深思熟虑的长期计划。	But it also needs effective communication that makes clear to the American people that the relationship with China truly is too big to fail and thus requires a long-term process of thoughtful engagement.
他还力图与邻国委内瑞拉激化矛盾，希望借此来浑水摸鱼。 他寄希望于自己选定的继承人前国防部长胡安·曼努埃尔·桑托斯联合国内的右翼势力，以确保他的政策能够继续实施。	He has also sought to benefit from ratcheting up tensions with neighboring Venezuela, and counts on his dauphin, former Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, to unite the country’s right-wing forces in order to ensure continuity with his policies.
事实上，对于当今欧洲来说，最麻烦的事情不是英国脱离，而是剩余27国的脆弱性和离心离德，欧洲民主共识已经蒸发殆尽。	Indeed, the most troubling thing about Europe today is not the United Kingdom’s departure, but the fragility and disunity of the remaining 27 states, where the domestic consensus for Europe has all but evaporated.
不幸的是，人口增长、城市化和糟糕的地权情况正在推高土地需求，进而削弱了许多农民投资和移植产权的能力。	Unfortunately, population growth, urbanization, and weak land rights are driving up demand for land, thereby undermining many farmers’ ability to invest in and replant their property.
2010年12月爆发的阿拉伯之春革命在2011年始终呈燎原之势，在这场革命后，联合国开发计划署开始编制2015年阿拉伯人类发展报告，重点探讨阿拉伯青年的困境。	After the Arab Spring, which began in December 2010 and gained momentum through 2011, the UNDP began the 2015 AHDR, which focused specifically on the plight of Arab youth.
即便美国真的决定完全退出伊核协议，该协议的其他缔约方 — — 中国、俄罗斯甚至包括欧洲（法国、德国和英国 ） — —都不会仿效美国的榜样。	Even if the United States does decide to withdraw from it completely, none of the other parties – not China or Russia or even the Europeans (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) – will follow suit.
从撒切尔夫人引入人头税到布莱尔支持美国领导的支持伊拉克战争，再到卡梅伦决定举行英国退出公投，这些决定破坏了英国的制度。	From Margaret Thatcher’s introduction of a poll tax to Tony Blair’s support for the US-led invasion of Iraq, to David Cameron’s decision to hold the Brexit referendum, such decisions have undermined the British system.
要出台财政巩固政策，美国还面临一些政治障碍：美国人自欺欺人地以为，他们一方面可以享受欧洲式的社会福利，另一方面还能享受像里根执政时期那样的低税率。	The US also faces political constraints to fiscal consolidation: Americans are deluding themselves that they can enjoy European-style social spending while maintaining low tax rates, as under President Ronald Reagan.
他还宣称，该决定“绝不是为了表明我们抛弃了推动长期和平协议的承诺 ， ” 这是一个“对以色列和巴勒斯坦都非常好的方案 。 ”	He also claimed that the decision “is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement,” one “that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.”
但正如金融监管一样，欧盟境内的核监管，即使是在欧洲原子能共同体内部的监管，在很大程度上还是各国内部事务。	But, like financial regulation, nuclear regulation in the EU, even with its Euratom treaty, is still essentially national.
事实上，研究志愿者很少有收到自己基因组数据的，这辜负了参与者对研究者的信任 — — 希望研究结果不仅能被用于增加科学知识储量，还能产生可起诉的结果。	Indeed, research volunteers rarely receive their genomic data, which betrays the trust that participants place in researchers to use their findings not only to increase the stock of scientific knowledge, but also to deliver actionable results.
领导人可能成为“梦游者 ” ， 无法通过（比如）建立能够协调导致和助长国际冲突的对立利益的机构遏制风险。	Leaders can be “sleepwalkers” who fail to manage risk by, say, establishing institutions that can channel the rival interests and claims that fuel international conflict.
举例而言，英国是十九世纪中叶的全球主导力量，但却任由普鲁士在欧洲大陆的核心缔造了强大的新德意志帝国。	For example, Britain was the dominant world power in the mid-nineteenth century, but it let Prussia create a powerful new German empire in the heart of the European continent.
在哥伦比亚总统桑托斯领导该国与哥伦比亚歌名武装力量（FARC）举行五十年激烈冲突史中最有希望的和平谈判时，他必须仔细考虑这一问题。	As President Juan Manuel Santos leads Colombia through the most promising peace talks in five decades of brutal conflict with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), he will have to consider this question carefully.
中国官方愿意公布的上一个关于年度劳工抗议活动的数字是1999年的100000起。 而据公安部2001年的一份内部报告披露，该数字自1997年以来“如疾风般增长 ” 。	The last annualized figure for labor protests that Beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999.
由此带来的一个结果是亚洲国家之间从未建立过直接的安全合作渠道，而这又导致了东亚国家之间缺乏信任，即使是同为美国盟友的日本和韩国。	One result is that no direct channel for security cooperation among Asian countries was ever established, which has contributed to the low level of trust in East Asia, even among close US allies like Japan and South Korea.
正如一位前白宫顾问指出的那样，小布什“痴迷于把民主带到中东这样的宏大理想，与其父亲谨慎渐进的作风截然不同 ” 。	As one former adviser put it, he was “irresistibly drawn to Big Ideas like bringing democracy to the Middle East, Big Ideas that stood in sharp contrast to the prudent small ball played by his father.”
在2012和2013年的大部分时间里西班牙和 意大利政府需要为十年期债务付出5.5 % — 7%的利率，而德国的利率还不到2 % 。	For much of 2012 and 2013, the Spanish and Italian governments were paying 5.5-7% for ten-year money, while the German rate was below 2%.
拉巴尼遇刺后不久，愤怒的总统卡尔扎伊与印度签署了“战略合作伙伴”协议（不过事后他又安慰性地说 ， “ 巴基斯坦是我们的同胞手足 ” ） 。	Soon after, an outraged President Hamid Karzai signed a “strategic partnership” agreement with India (though he added, as a placatory afterthought, that “Pakistan is our twin brother”).
第二个解释是，投资者从此前的冲击中判断 — — 如2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击 — — 决策者会用强力货币和财政政策宽松来支撑经济和金融市场，从而拯救世界。	A second explanation is that investors are extrapolating from previous shocks, such as the attacks of September 11, 2001, when policymakers saved the day by backstopping the economy and financial markets with strong monetary and fiscal policy easing.
尽管听起来像是诡辩，但继续以目标值来作为经济目标给人的信息是坚决明确的指导，这与政府的市场导向意图相悖。	While it may seem like splitting hairs, continuing to frame the economic goal as a target sends a message of determined and explicit guidance that now seems at odds with the government’s market-oriented intentions.
单一市场成立时，许多人认为它将为本国企业和决策者提供足够的激励发展可靠的国家层面的机构，以便抓住诱人的新机会。	When the single market was created, many assumed that it would provide ample incentives for domestic firms and policymakers to develop sound national-level institutions, in order to capitalize on lucrative new opportunities.
首先，暴跌的股价导致投资者账户中的股票下降到维持保证金水平以下，于是经纪商开始催缴保证金，迫使投资者甩卖更多资产以获得所需要的现金。	First, as plummeting stock prices caused the equity in investors’ accounts to fall below the maintenance margin, brokers began issuing margin calls, forcing investors to offload more assets to come up with the needed cash.
但维也纳协议理应获得广泛支持，因为其他办法 — — 最好情况是继续尖锐地区对立，最坏情况是军事冲突 — — 更加糟糕。	But the Vienna agreement deserves wide support, and not just because the alternatives – continuation of acute regional tension at best, and catastrophic military conflict at worst – are so unappealing.
据国际货币基金组织（IMF）数据，2017年中国国民储蓄可能高达GDP的45 % ， 远高于28%的日本储蓄率。	According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s national savings is likely to hit 45% of GDP in 2017, well above Japan’s 28% saving rate.
他的干预将人们的注意力从当时所犯的巨大的政策错误上引开：信用去监管，它导致了20世纪90年代的深度金融危机，也是2008年爆发的全球危机的先声。	His interventions diverted attention from the grave policy error being made at the time: deregulation of credit, which led to a deep financial crisis in the 1990s and anticipated the global crisis that erupted in 2008.
但想象一下：2010年，北卡罗来纳州海岸资源委员会科学小组采用先进方法估算海平面上升可能会在下个世纪对某些低洼群体构成威胁。	But consider this: In 2010, the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission’s Science Panel, using advanced methods, estimated a sea-level rise that could threaten certain low-lying communities over the next century.
同样，在首先从未承认过罪责的奥地利，总理塞巴斯蒂安·库尔兹（Sebastian Kurz）的极右翼反移民联盟已经准备好要终结欧盟的“去身份化”政治。	Similarly, in Austria – which, to be sure, never admitted guilt in the first place – Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s far-right, anti-immigration coalition is poised to end the EU’s politics of “identity annihilation.”
但是，尽管这一方针在过去也许起了作用，但它也会导致忽略人才在构想和实现让增长成为可能的思想方面的作用。	But, although this approach may have worked in the past, it risks giving short shrift to the role that talent plays in generating and realizing the ideas that make growth possible.
这次不同于伦敦的20国集团会议，他们应该充分做好他们的工作 — — 不仅仅是为了保护我们的气候，也是为了重振全球经济。	This time, unlike at the London G-20 meeting, they should do the job properly – both to protect our climate and to reboot the global economy.
佩尔米诺夫的态度跟这差不多，他似乎认为只有那些已经有能力搞大型航天项目的国家才有资格加入阿波菲斯方案的决策圈。	Perminov similarly seemed to suggest that only countries with large existing space programs could participate in the Apophis decision.
商界中间阶层的下滑也可能产生一些反弹，尽管这一影响在不同行业可能存在差异，并将不断受到结构性逆向因素的挑战。	The decline of the middle in business is also likely to result in some pushback, though the impact will differ significantly by industry and will be continuously challenged by structural headwinds.
社交媒体自认为已经完全攫取了报纸所拥有的影响力，这一幻觉蒙蔽了它们的双眼，结果，社交媒体专家们颠覆就媒介的尝试以贻笑大方收场。	Blinkered by the illusion of having snatched whatever influence newspapers commanded, social media’s mavens bungled their attempts to dethrone the older medium.
此外，由于中国的债务绝大多数是国有银行对国有企业的贷款，因此存款人和投资者都很有信心（不管对错）地认为他们的资产有政府的隐性担保。	Moreover, because China’s debt consists overwhelmingly of loans by state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises, depositors and investors feel confident (rightly or wrongly) that their assets carry an implicit government guarantee.
是的，叙利亚世俗反对派既软弱又分歧严重，而圣战份子无疑更有力量；但即使反对派胜出也并不一定由圣战份子领导。	Yes, Syria’s secular opposition is weak and divided, while the jihadis are more dynamic; but jihadi supremacy in the event of an opposition victory is not inevitable.
但改变中国治国的制度（system of government）不是特朗普政府最紧迫的重点工作，尽管美国贸易代表罗伯特·莱特希泽（Robert Lighthizer）和白宫国家贸易委员会主任彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro）气势汹汹。	But the Trump administration has more urgent priorities than changing China’s system of government, notwithstanding the aggressive rhetoric of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro.
审计办公室的全部结论是，先前宏观经济不景气，而如今情况有所好转 — — 这显然不是什么意义重大的发现。	All that the GAO established is that the macroeconomy was previously in bad shape and it is now doing somewhat better – hardly a profound finding.
但特朗普认为 — — 受到了为他说话的人的遥相呼应 — — 碧和巴尔一样坏，甚至犹有过之，则忽视了一个关键区别。	But Trump’s view – echoed by people who speak for him – that Bee was as bad as Barr, if not worse, ignores a crucial distinction.
更合理的解释是，战略轰炸确实事关士气，但不是敌人的士气，而是在其他手段都没有效果时，必须提振大后方的士气。	A more plausible explanation is that strategic bombing is indeed about morale, but not that of the enemy. It is the morale of the home front that must be boosted, when other methods appear to fail.
与伊朗的核协议对中东和东南亚也具有类似的重要影响 — — 这一前景可以很好地解释以色列和沙特阿拉伯对谈判的频频作梗。	A nuclear deal with Iran would have similarly important implications in the Middle East and Southwest Asia – a prospect that largely explains fervent opposition to negotiations by Israel and Saudi Arabia.
但如今，由于当局为了维持中国的惊人增长而启动新的进程，他们应该迅速采取行动，在自己的政策议程内部实现更大的一致性。	Now, however, as the authorities set out on a new course aimed at sustaining China’s extraordinary progress, they should act quickly to achieve greater coherence in their policy agenda.
库尔德人在该国的主要代表库尔德工人党（PKK）明确信仰世俗、马克思式的民族主义，数十年来一直在与土耳其政府进行斗争。	The Kurds’ main representative in that country, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – which champions a distinctly secular, Marxist brand of nationalism – has been fighting the Turkish government for decades.
丽莎·萨克斯（Lisa Sachs）和我最近指出，负责任的投资者必须尽快询问这些公司有什么计划应对2℃升温限制。	As Lisa Sachs and I recently explained, responsible investors must urgently query these companies about their business plans to comply with the 2º limit on warming.
考虑到支票的扫描间几乎可以在瞬间得到电子化处理，这个依然存在的滞后只能归因为“浮利 ” — —也就是尽可能长时间截留款项所获得的利息。	Given that scanned images of checks could easily be processed electronically almost instantaneously, the enduring delay can be explained only by “float” – that is, the interest earned by holding onto money for as long as possible.
但是，拟议中的美印协议却由于第二个、也是远远更有争议的原因而引起人们的注意。 那就是，人们担忧，这一协议不仅不会促进，反而会削弱抵制世界范围内核武器的进一步扩散。	But the proposed US-India accord is attracting notice for a second, and far more controversial, reason: concern that it could weaken, rather than advance, efforts to resist the further worldwide spread of nuclear weapons.
在它的支持下通过了“保护责任 ” ， 即要求国际社会在国家政府无力保护民众免遭大规模暴行的情况下承担起这个职责。	And it underpinned the adoption of the “responsibility to protect” principle, which demands that the international community defend a country’s people from mass-atrocity crimes when their own government fails to do so.
为了缩小自身与公众之间对经济的预期差异，美联储公布了每位公开市场委员会成员对未来几年的预期利率范围。	To narrow any gap between its expectations for the economy and those of the public, the Fed publishes each FOMC member’s view of the range of interest rates that should be expected over the next few years.
在德国，启蒙运动渗透着康德“永恒和平”的愿景，他要求根据可以成为普遍规律的箴言的“绝对规则”行事，而不是屈从于某个人的一时好恶和狭隘的自利原则。	In Germany, it was imbued with Immanuel Kant’s vision of “perpetual peace,” grounded in the “categorical imperative” to act according to maxims that can be made into a universal law, rather than according to personal whims and narrow self-interest.
欧洲目前也在面临着危机，作为世界经济重要的一部分，欧洲正经历着有史以来最大的衰退，德国政府甚至警告说，2009年的GDP可能下滑6 % 。	Europe, too, faces challenges, and not just from the fact that it now has the worst downturn of the world’s major economic regions, with Germany’s government warning of a surreal 6% decline in GDP for 2009.
虽然伊斯兰国和基地组织存在这样那样的意识形态和战略分歧，但结成抗敌 — — 现任阿拉伯政权和西方 — — 联盟的可能性却无法完全排除。	The ideological and strategic rift between ISIS and Al Qaeda notwithstanding, an alliance against the common enemy – the incumbent Arab regimes and the West – cannot be entirely discounted.
事实上，要想说服高收入国家 — — 及其纳税人增加发展援助支出，我们必须更注重于性价比，并认识到并非所有发展目标都是平等的。	In fact, to persuade high-income countries – and their taxpayers – to increase their development-aid outlays, we will have to be more mindful of costs and benefits, and recognize that not all development targets are equal.
应当以回收二氧化碳经济可行的方式建造新型电厂，而建造新的管道将二氧化碳运送到储存地点，设计新的监控系统来控制泄漏。	New kinds of power plants will have to be built to make carbon capture economical, new pipelines will have to be built to transport the CO2 to storage sites, and new monitoring systems will have to be designed to control leaks.
伦敦 — — 我提笔写这篇文章时，我妻子抛出了一个应景的难题 ： “ 圣诞节就要到了，人们应该享受和平快乐。	LONDON – As I put pen to paper, my wife threw out a seasonal challenge: “Christmas is approaching – the time for peace and joy and all that.
最终，绝大多数公司没有破产，主要是由于阿根廷退出方案中的第四条：资本管制给公司外债争取到了时间和法律保护。	Eventually, most companies avoided bankruptcy, mainly owing to the fourth ingredient in Argentina´s exit toolkit: capital controls that provided the legal umbrella to stop external corporate debt servicing.
其实正如西巴尔所说，即使在印度领导不结盟运动期间，该运动对长达数十年的“美国/西方技术制裁”也没有提供任何帮助。	Indeed, as Sibal points out, NAM did not protect India from decades of “US/Western technology-related sanctions,” even when it was the movement’s leader.
这就是我的老板比尔·盖茨最近在伦敦皇家联合军种防务研究所（Royal United Services Institute）面对英国著名军事和安全思想家时所提出的概念。	That is a point that my boss, Bill Gates, drove home recently, when he addressed the United Kingdom’s leading military and security thinkers at the Royal United Services Institute in London.
在独立五十年之际，有必要反思肯尼亚所取得的成就和失败，特别是教育领域 — — 该领域是经济机会和公共部门专业化的关键。	The anniversary provides a reason to reflect on some of the country’s achievements and failings, especially in the field of education – the key to economic opportunity and professionalization of the public sector.
如果2016年中国GDP增长达到6.7 % — —与政府官方目标一致，略高于国际货币基金组织（IMF）的最新预测6.6 % — —则中国将为世界GDP增长贡献1.2个百分点。	If Chinese GDP growth reaches 6.7% in 2016 – in line with the government’s official target and only slightly above the International Monetary Fund’s latest prediction (6.6%) – China would account for 1.2 percentage points of world GDP growth.
有关各方对其发动了一场破坏性的战争而没有借助于国际论坛。 这场战争不止推翻了萨达姆的统治，也给成千上万的平民造成了伤害。	Instead of recurring to an international forum, a devastating war was declared that went beyond deposing Saddam, wreaking damage on tens of thousands of civilians, and thus confounding the message of condemnation.
但随着对他们应该“普通 ” 、 尽可能准确地代表其人民的习惯和品位的期望越来越高，这一角色也变得日益不切实际。	But this role has atrophied with the rising expectation that they should be “normal,” representing their populations’ habits and tastes as closely as possible.
这是因为，动物农业产生了整整三分之一的人造甲烷和三分之二的一氧化二氮排放 — — 这两种气体都是固热能力比二氧化碳还要强的强力温室气体。	This is because the animal sector is responsible for a third of all anthropogenic methane and two-thirds of nitrous oxide emissions – both potent greenhouse gases that trap more heat than carbon dioxide.
相比于美国在国际货币基金组织中16.8%的投票份额，以及亚洲开发银行12.8%的份额（日本的该两项比例为6.2%和12.8 % ） ，中国则只有区区3.8%及5.5 % 。 。	China accounts for a 3.8% voting share of the IMF and a 5.5% share of the ADB, compared to 16.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the United States and 6.2% and 12.8% for Japan.
随着银行被鼓励放松贷款标准，特别是对中产阶级家庭的贷款标准，住宅建设和债务融资消费的回升间更进一步刺激增长。	As banks are encouraged to loosen lending standards, especially for middle-income households, an upswing in residential construction and debt-financed consumption should add further growth impetus.
对于博物馆策展人塔蒂亚娜·尼古拉夫娜·维特洛娃（Tatiana Nicolaevna Vetrova）来说，贝阿铁路是团结的象征。	To Tatiana Nicolaevna Vetrova, the museum’s curator, the BAM was a symbol of unity.
但是，美联储随后两次QE，即QE2和QE3，并没有大量外国购买与之配合，给金融市场造成的影响也相当温和，这一事实很能说明问题。	It is instructive, however, that the Fed’s next two policy installments, QE2 and QE3, were not matched by large foreign purchases and appeared to have only modest effects in financial markets.
有些地方部门干脆直接吊销了有问题企业的生产许可证，这样一来，正如一位监管者所言，这些企业就“不存在”了。	And there were also jurisdictions that had canceled the licenses of the operators in question, so that, as one regulator put it, they simply “didn’t exist.”
相反，它将促使成员国政府超越狭隘的国家利益，捍卫开放性和多边主义，直面最近方兴未艾的排斥性政治势力。	On the contrary, it would compel member states’ governments to look beyond narrow national interest, defend openness and multilateralism, and confront head-on the exclusionary political forces that have lately been gaining ground.
即使足球并未引发真实的流血事件，它也能激起人们强烈而原始的部族情感，让人联想到脸上涂满油彩的战士上窜下跳地跳起战舞，并像猩猩一样大声呼喊。	Even when football doesn’t lead to actual bloodshed, it inspires strong emotions – primitive and tribal – evoking the days when warriors donned facial paint and jumped up and down in war dances, hollering like apes.
财政部求助亚洲开发银行，后者确认大量资金从发电机组租赁协议中漏出，许多租赁单位的发电量远低于承诺值。	The finance ministry called in the Asian Development Bank, which confirmed that a large amount of money had leaked from the agreements, and that many of the rental units generated much less power than promised.
没有它们的介入，巴沙尔政权极有可能仍然会采取高压政策；有了它们的参与，叙利亚变成了大规模死亡和毁灭之地。	Without their involvement, Assad’s regime would most likely have remained repressive; with their involvement, Syria has become a site of mass death and destruction.
我们不明白邓小平理想中的一套“有中国特色的社会主义制度”的经济安排是如何的。 我想他自己也很可能不甚清楚。	We do not know what Deng’s desired set of economic arrangements for a system of “socialism with Chinese characteristics” was, and, in all likelihood, he did not know, either.
央行应该培养年轻人、女性和少数群体，以扩大方针、机能、角度和专业性的范围，这些都是未来高效货币决策的必要条件。	Central banks ought to be cultivating younger people, women, and minorities, in order to broaden the range of approaches, skills, perspectives, and expertise that effective monetary policymaking will require in the future.
以跳楼价私有化 — — 所得资金大部分用来还债 — — 不可能让希腊议会或公众充满热情地推动结构改革。	Privatization at fire-sale prices, with most of the proceeds used to pay down debt, will not put Greek parliamentarians or the public in a mood to press ahead enthusiastically with structural reform.
比如，ICG创始人所看到的主要的未满足需要是为了安全和预算原因补充政府的日益无能，开发关于冲突区到底在发生什么的准确图景。	The primary unmet need seen by the founders of the ICG, for example, was to compensate for governments’ growing incapacity, for both security and budgetary reasons, to develop an accurate picture of what was happening on the ground in conflict zones.
从经济危机的爆发开始，时间已经过去了8个月，我们还只是停留在临时的紧急救助计划上，而不是对整个系统进行修补。	It is now in the process of being better funded, but we are eight months into a crisis in which international capital flows became volatile and were driven largely by emergency responses rather than underlying economic fundamentals.
比如国际关系学者就用1938年英国首相张伯伦和希特勒在慕尼黑的会议作为一个模型来解释对一个扩张主义政权使用绥靖政策可能会是无效（或危险）的。	For example, international-relations scholars use the famous meeting between Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler in Munich in 1938 as a model of how appeasing a power bent on expansionism can be futile (or dangerous).
在债务过多和储蓄不足的环境下，财富效应对于改善资产负债表衰退作用甚微。 当房产和信用泡沫破裂时，资产负债表衰退令美国家庭遭受重创。	In an environment of excess debt and inadequate savings, wealth effects have done very little to ameliorate the balance-sheet recession that clobbered US households when the property and credit bubbles burst.
包括穆罕默德•阿卜杜和加马勒丁•阿尔阿富汗尼在内的早期改革者没有能够如其所愿地广泛发动群众，也就未能够通过宗教手段矫治社会的不幸。	These early reformers, among them Muhammad Abduh and Jamaleddin al-Afghani, did not ignite the mass mobilization they hoped for, and were not able to redress social ills through better implementation of religious prescriptions.
这一模式将在最新选举中实施（这也是2009年12月里斯本条约生效以来的首次选举 ） ， 从民主角度看，这一方案好处多多。	This formula will be implemented in the upcoming election (the first since the Lisbon Treaty entered into force in December 2009), and there is much to say in its favor from a democratic standpoint.
洛杉矶—沙特阿拉伯宣布了一项名为《愿景2030 》 （ Vision 2030）的宏大计划，吸引了全世界的注意。	LOS ANGELES – Saudi Arabia has captured the world’s attention with the announcement of an ambitious agenda, called Vision 2030, aimed at overhauling the structure of its economy.
放弃为经济刺激计划而设定的各国拿出2%的GDP目标，就外围国家需要国家援助保护他们的金融系统和参与反周期的各项政策达成共识���足可实现的。	Instead of setting a universal target of 2% of GDP for stimulus packages, it is enough to agree that the periphery countries need international assistance to protect their financial systems and engage in countercyclical policies.
但是，决大西洋两岸的决策者并没有继续完成改革过程，而是似乎准备开倒车，取消带来现有进步的大部分措施了。	But, instead of completing the reform process, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic seem determined to undo most of the measures underpinning what progress has been achieved.
届时太平洋在世界上的影响可能扩大，大西洋的影响将会减小，同时势必以中美两国为轴心构成全球政治新的联合体。	The world will be more Pacific and less transatlantic, and the new axis of global politics will be formed by the Sino-American tandem.
乔伊斯·班达基金会（Joyce Banda Foundation）的目标之一是强化马拉维妇女的经济独立，从而为作为未来领导者的年轻女孩的发展和崛起创造条件。	One of the objectives of the Joyce Banda Foundation is to strengthen the financial independence of Malawian women, and thereby create the conditions for the development and emergence of young girls as future leaders.
因此，他们必须与决策者合作，包括财政当局和金融监管当局，来确保正确的货币和财政政策组合和结构性改革。	That is why they must cooperate with policymakers, including fiscal authorities and financial regulators, to ensure the right mix of monetary and fiscal policy, as well as structural reform.
几周之前，评论家和分析师们还在大谈拯救欧洲的时间只剩下了几个月，而如今，连轴转出席峰会的政治领导人已开始用“天”作为计时单位。	Whereas a few weeks ago, commentators and financial analysts argued that only a few months remained to rescue Europe, leading politicians, lurching from summit to summit, have recently talked in terms of days.
欧洲的调整可能更加痛苦，因为主权债务危机对所有人都形成了抑制效应，消费者、投资者、公共部门，概莫能外。	The adjustment will be even more painful in Europe, because a sovereign-debt crisis has a depressing effect on everyone – consumers, investors, and the public sector alike.
在全国层面复制这项计划 — — 有时被称为介于“志愿消防队和国民卫队”之间的力量 — — 能够加强美国在这方面的能力。	Replicating this program – described as something between a “volunteer fire department and the national guard” – on a national level could bolster US capabilities.
其中的五项改革尤为有效：放开汇率、增持外汇、控制顺周期财政政策、巩固经常账户和减少以美元及其他外币计价的借债。	Five reforms were particularly effective: more flexible exchange rates, larger foreign-currency holdings, less pro-cyclical fiscal policy, stronger current accounts, and less debt denominated in dollars or other foreign currencies.
令人感到惊讶的是，各政党的政治家们-甚至包括那些在意识形态上强烈捍卫市场不受干预的人们-是如此愿意接受这样的观念，即，当银行和保险公司遇到麻烦的时候，国家应给予解救。	It is surprising how readily politicians of all parties – even strong ideological defenders of the unregulated market – accepted the idea that the state should bail out banks and insurance companies when they got into trouble.
这个国家方兴未艾的经济和政治发展让生活在这里的人，以及像我这样的关注它的观察者，对它的未来感到喜忧参半。	The country’s ongoing process of economic and political development has left those living here, as well as concerned observers like me, both hopeful and worried about the future.
随着资本撤出新兴市场，这些国家将被迫采取自身的紧缩措施并形成经常项目盈余，一如欧元区外围国今天的行为。	As capital withdraws from emerging markets, these countries soon will be forced to adopt their own austerity measures and run current-account surpluses, much like the eurozone periphery today.
我们必须教导人们，尤其是我们的孩子，把他们自己想象成“将会成为英雄 ” ， 在遇到也许在他们的一生中只会发生一次的特定情境下会随时做出英雄的举动。	We must teach people, especially our children, to think of themselves as “heroes-in-waiting,” ready to take heroic action in a particular situation that may occur only once in their lifetime.
在十二世纪，一群波利尼西亚人找到了一个偏远的火山岛，岛上有茂密的森林提供食物、动物和工具和材料，让他们得以打造数百个复杂而神秘的石像。	Sometime in the twelfth century, a group of Polynesians found their way to a remote volcanic island where dense forests provided food, animals, and the tools and materials to build hundreds of complex and mysterious stone sculptures.
奥巴马把7870亿美元的财政刺激计划外包给国会，而不出人们所料，把持国会的大佬们又在计划中塞入了笼络人心的社会工程及好处费。	Obama outsourced the details of the $787 billion fiscal stimulus to Congress and, no surprise, the old barons of the House stuffed it with pork and social engineering.
迷你电网所需要的资本投资要小于电网扩张，因此更容易确保融资，这意味着它们可以为原本需要等待多年才能接入电网的社区提供电力。	Because mini-grids require less capital investment than grid expansion, it can be easier to secure financing for them, meaning that they can electrify communities that might have to wait years for a grid connection.
这是给已经不堪重负的美国财政雪上加霜，美国的预算赤字已超GDP的10 % ， 公共债务到2014年预计达到GDP的两倍。	Thus, an already unsustainable US fiscal path, with budget deficits above 10% of GDP and public debt expected to double as a share of GDP by 2014, becomes even worse.
她是四个孩子的母亲，宣传相信传统家庭价值观，对于右翼选民很有吸引力；而其与奥朗德的非婚关系则让她显得是一个典型的现代女性。	A mother of four children who proclaims to believe in traditional family values, she is attractive to right-wing voters, while her non-matrimonial relationship with Hollande makes her seem a quintessentially modern woman.
国际货币基金组织也开始减少条件，并且终于开始质疑人们对资本市场自由化的期待究竟有多高，这原先可是该基金议程的重中之重。	The Fund, too, began to reduce conditionality, and eventually it began to question the desirability of capital market liberalization, which previously had been central to its agenda.
当时像现在一样，有一点非常清楚：那就是支持数十年高增长、结构转型、就业及收入上升和贫困显著下降的政策相辅相成。	Then, as now, one thing is clear: the policies that underpin multi-decade periods of high growth, structural transformation, rising employment and incomes, and dramatic reductions in poverty are mutually reinforcing.
平心而论，各国外交决策者经常必须在相互矛盾的道德价值之间 — — 比如公正和和平 — — 做出艰难抉择。	To be fair to diplomatic policymakers everywhere, it is often the case that hard choices between competing moral values – for example, justice and peace – simply have to be made.
当技术进步和全球化，更不要说社会和文化变革，超过了人们的适应能力，他们就会变得焦躁且具备破坏性和压倒性。	When technological progress and globalization, not to mention social and cultural change, outpace people’s ability to adapt, they become too jarring, disruptive, and overwhelming.
这些探索是最近才开展的，原因是到目前为止，以整组基因的方式进行基因不平衡性全面评定的技术还达不到要求。	This discovery was made recently because until now, the technology was not available to comprehensively assess genomic imbalances in a genome-wide fashion.
在那种情况下，喀土穆、杰济拉和两个北部省份等剩余的“苏丹”领土也许会进一步退化，甚至可能演变为全球范围内的伊斯兰恐怖主义基地。	In that case, what remains of “Sudan” – Khartoum, Gezira, and the two northern states – might degenerate even further, probably turning into a base for global Islamic terrorism.
尼日尔三角洲的石油清理行动给尼日利亚、石油产业以及国际社会提供了一个理想的机会来向世界昭示 — — 一个新的时代已经到来了。	The cleanup of the Niger Delta provides an ideal opportunity for Nigeria, the oil industry, and the international community to show convincingly that a new age has dawned.
1997年3月，沈良西（Sam Rainsy）领导的反对运动遭遇手榴弹袭击，造成16人死亡、一百多人手上。	A grenade attack on an opposition rally led by Sam Rainsy in March 1997 killed 16 people and injured more than a hundred.
显然，德班会晤并没有就建议中的新开发银行的细节和结构给出多少信息，这表明自上届新德里会晤以来，在这方面并未取得多少进展（开发银行的计划正是在新德里提出的 ） 。	Tellingly, the meeting in Durban failed to produce any details of the structure of the proposed new development bank, suggesting that little progress had been made in the year since the BRICS’ last meeting in New Delhi, where the plan was announced.
包括伊斯兰国战斗人员在内的叙利亚武装分子已经渗透到黎巴嫩，威胁重燃该国民族战争的战火，并破坏作为安全保障的真主党合法性。	Syrian militants, including Islamic State fighters, have penetrated Lebanon, threatening to rekindle the country’s ethnic war and undermining Hezbollah’s legitimacy as the guarantor of its security.
如果问题出现，政府对银行的支持会给银行带去信心；并且，当一些国家的政府比其它国家的政府处境好很多时，其对于银行的隐性补贴也比别的国家大很多。	It is confidence that if trouble arises the government will support the banks that gives confidence in the banks; and, when some governments are in a much stronger position than others, the implicit subsidy is larger for those countries.
换句话说，地区贸易协定并没有刺激总体贸易增长，而主要是让贸易发生转移：协定参与国之间的贸易有所增加，并产生收益，但第三方贸易萎缩，并导致（较小的）损失。	In other words, rather than spurring increased trade overall, regional agreements may primarily divert it: trade increases among participating countries, to their benefit, but declines for third parties, which incur (small) costs.
在欧盟内部营造能源税收公平竞争的环境，这将有助于协调经济激励措施，消除司机为降低成本而跨越国界的高风险旅游方式，改善所有欧洲经济体的商业环境。	Creating a level playing field on energy taxation in the EU would harmonize economic incentives, eliminate gas-tank tourism by drivers crossing borders for lower prices, and improve the business climate in all of Europe’s economies.
如果要符合这一重要条件的话，西方各国政府就必须与这个内部存在分歧且相对缺乏经验的反对派展开紧密合作。	Western governments need to work much more closely with the divided and relatively inexperienced opposition if this imperative is to be met.
几种金属的价格无法评判枝节横生的马尔萨斯对丰饶（Malthus vs. Cornucopia）的争论，正如一个简单的失业数据无法权威判定科文和卡普兰之间的争议。	A handful of metal prices cannot settle a sprawling Malthus vs. Cornucopia argument, just as a single data point for unemployment cannot be the final word in the dispute between Cowen and Caplan.
例如在同一项调查中，一些正在进行数字化转型的公司反映其核心产品或服务中17％的市场份额竟然是被自己的数字产品或服务蚕食掉了。	For example, in the same survey, companies with digital transformations under way said that 17% of their market share in core products or services was cannibalized by their own digital products or services.
事实上，到本月为止，埃尔多安总理在最近访问了许多中东国家-叙利亚，黎巴嫩，埃及，阿尔及利亚，约旦、沙特阿拉伯、伊朗和伊拉克，但他自2005年以来还没有过到布鲁塞尔。	In fact, whereas Erdoğan recently visited many Middle East countries – Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq – until this month, he had not been to Brussels since 2005.
对冲基金艾略特管理公司（Elliot Management）旗下的NML资本公司在保罗·辛格（Paul Singer）的带领下于2008年花了4,800万美元购买这些债券；根据葛里萨的裁决，NML资本公司现在应该获得8.32亿美元 — — 回报超过1,600 % 。	NML Capital, a subsidiary of the hedge fund Elliot Management, headed by Paul Singer, spent $48 million on bonds in 2008; thanks to Griesa’s ruling, NML Capital should now receive $832 million – a return of more than 1,600%.
事实上，这要求两家机构的新领导人 — — 日本银行的黑田东彦和欧洲央行的马里奥·德拉吉(Mario Draghi ) — —最终开始指定正确的货币政策。	Indeed, it required new leaders in both institutions – Haruhiko Kuroda at the BOJ and Mario Draghi at the ECB – finally to set monetary policy right.
首先，欧元区似乎如一个真正的货币联盟在运转：资本市场一体化加速；跨境活动增加；成员国之间人均GDP差距减小。	At first, the eurozone seemed to function like a true currency union: capital-market integration was accelerated; cross-border activity increased; and the per capita income gap between member countries decreased.
主流观点仍认为危机前的时期属于常态，至少从实体经济增长模式的角度看是如此，因此人们认定当前挑战在于用危机前模式重塑增长。	Because the dominant narrative still maintains that the pre-crisis period was normal, at least in terms of the growth pattern in the real economy, the perceived challenge is to restore growth according to the pre-crisis pattern.
鉴于欧洲已经成功地缔造了欧洲货币联盟 、 《 马斯特利赫特条约》和《稳定与增长协定 》 ， 建立一个确定G-7式成员资格的体系对于欧元区的专家们来说应该相对容易。	Given that Europe managed to construct EMU, the Maastricht Treaty, and the stability and growth pact that underlines the euro, it should be relatively easy for euro-zone experts to help devise a system for judging G-7 type membership.
因此，第一和第二部分无须新辩论就可通过并能为形成新条约打下基础，因此尼斯条约将继续适用；并且有关欧洲社会模式的辩论将持续下去。	So the first and second parts could be ratified without new negotiations and could form the basis for the new Treaty, so that the Treaty of Nice would still apply; and the debate on the European social model would continue.
新政策应着眼于扩大青年大规模失业国家的经济机会，这样年轻人就不会觉得冒着生命危险前往欧洲是他们未来的唯一机会。	The new policy should focus on contributing to the creation of economic opportunities in countries with large unemployed youth populations, so that young people no longer feel that risking their lives to reach Europe is their only chance at a future.
实际上，该决议着眼扭转真主党取得的优势，并且忽略黎巴嫩社会发生的深刻变化，最为重要的就是什叶派社区日益提高的自信。	In effect, the resolution envisaged reversing Hezbollah’s gains and ignores the deep changes that have occurred in Lebanese society, most importantly the Shia community’s growing self-confidence.
但对美国和全球经济的更积极展望暗示假以时日美联储和其他各国央行都将退出量化宽松和零政策利率，而这意味着实际利率将会攀升而非下降。	But the more positive outlook about the US and the global economy implies that over time the Federal Reserve and other central banks will exit from quantitative easing and zero policy rates, which means that real rates will rise, rather than fall.
各国具体情况各不相同，但由经济学家菲利普·阿齐安（Philippe Aghion）和彼得·霍伊特（Peter Howitt）提出的注重创新的新熊彼特主义增长理论提供了了一些重要洞见。	While the specifics vary across countries, the innovation-focused Neo-Schumpeterian growth theory, proposed by the economists Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt, offers some important insights.
但政治还远不足以取代经济学的地位，它们依旧声名狼藉，因为主流领导人 — — 特别是在北美和欧洲 — — 仍要仰仗经济学理论论证他们的政策选择。	But politics, far from rising to take its place, continues to be discredited, as mainstream leaders – particularly in North America and Europe – call on economic theories to justify their policy choices.
拥有博士学位的经济学家，比如那些充斥着美联储工作和领导团队的人，总是偏向同类人，而质疑其他人担任货币政策最高职位的资质。	PhD economists, like those who dominate the Fed’s staff and leadership, tend to favor their own kind and doubt others’ qualifications for top monetary-policy jobs.
这些对比并非是中立的，人们也许会看到，用今天的中国和十九世纪的德国相比较，是对别人的麻烦抱着一种幸灾乐祸的态度，用德语说就是“Schadenfreude ” 。	These comparisons are not neutral, and one may detect in the analogy between China today and nineteenth-century Germany an element of that guilty pleasure in others’ troubles that the Germans call “Schadenfreude.”
该银行由哈萨克斯坦实际经营，但铀将由国际原子能机构所有和控制，并且只能用于无核武器国家，条件是（不管出于什么原因）它们无法从商业市场上获得它们所需要的低浓缩铀。	While Kazakhstan will physically operate the bank, the uranium will be owned and controlled by the IAEA, and made available to non-nuclear-weapon states if, for any reason, they cannot secure the LEU they need from the commercial market.
然而弗朗哥万万没想到胡安▪卡洛斯在一位聪颖而年轻的弗朗哥时期官员阿多夫▪舒瓦雷茨的帮助下所建立的是今天这样现代、民主的西班牙。	Little did Franco realize that what Juan Carlos would build, with the help of a clever young Franco-era bureaucrat named Adolfo Suarez, was the modern, democratic Spain of today.
据报导微软的一位发言人说该公司已经封锁了中国的“很多站点 ” ， 而且几个月来外界传言微软在华的博客工具一直从标题中过滤“民主”和“人权”这样的字眼。	A Microsoft spokeswoman was reported as saying that the corporation has blocked “many sites” in China, and it has been known for several months that Microsoft’s blog tool in China filters words like “democracy” and “human rights” from blog titles.
在世界局势日趋复杂和美国越来越不愿承担国际责任的条件下，制定充分规则并指定贯彻裁判的必要性变得日益突出。	Confronted with the world’s increasing complexity and America’s decreasing appetite for international responsibilities, the need for adequate rules – and for a referee to enforce them – is greater than ever.
因此，在未来若干年内，中亚将在很多领域面临领导权力的更替，而像土库曼那样在支撑国家政权时一直扮演重要角色的安全机构将很可能发挥重要的政治作用。	So, in the next few years, Central Asia will face leadership change on many fronts, with security apparatuses – which, as in Turkmenistan, have been crucial to buttressing these countries’ regimes – likely to be important players.
如今，欧元区正在走向银行联盟，或许喉头还会有财政联盟，而这反过来会产生真正的政治联盟，将重要经济决策的主权集中化。	Today, the eurozone is on its way toward implementing a banking union, probably followed by a fiscal union, which in turn will lead to a genuine political union that centralizes sovereignty over essential economic policymaking.
合在一起，这两种全球化反对力量解释了为何即使在长期以来一直鼓吹加强开放的西方发达国家，阻碍商品、资本和劳动力自由流动的保护主义壁垒也一直存在。	Taken together, the two types of backlash against globalization explain why protectionist barriers to the free flow of goods, capital, and labor have been erected even in developed Western countries that long advocated greater openness.
从这种意义上说（也仅仅在这个意义上 ） ， 引起变化和运动远离过时技术的短期投资 — — 在零售业以及整个经济中 — — 可能会很好地促进长期繁荣。	In this sense (and only this sense), short-term thinking that induces change and movement away from obsolete technology – here and throughout the economy – may well facilitate long-term prosperity.
特别地，在乌克兰问题上与欧洲和美国的紧张对立将让俄罗斯的能源和原材料出口 — — 以及相关管道 — — 转向亚洲和中国。	In particular, the tension with Europe and the United States over Ukraine will shift Russia’s energy and raw-material exports – and the related pipelines – toward Asia and China.
现在自己却成了官方犹太人的代表，他似乎没有记住Pirkei Avot （ 《 父辈的伦理 》 ） 一书中那句令人毛骨悚然的格言 ： “ 切勿与统治者寻求不当的亲密关系 。 ”	And now he had been consecrated as an official Jew, seeming to have forgotten the chilling maxim from Pirkei Avot (“Ethics of the Fathers”): “Seek not undue intimacy with the ruling power.”
其他努力包括以厨师杰米·奥利弗为首的名人呼吁，以及像芝麻街风格平台Kickin’ Nutrition那样的同龄人学习尝试（全面披露：这个节目的创始人是我的妻子 ） 。	Other efforts include appeals by celebrities like the chef Jamie Oliver and attempts to use peer-based learning, such as the Sesame Street-inspired platform Kickin’ Nutrition (full disclosure: the creator is my wife).
坎布里奇—美国当选总统唐纳德·特朗普尚未履新，但自11月出人意料地赢得大选以来，其漏洞百出的产业政策已经充分展现在人们眼前。	CAMBRIDGE – US President-elect Donald Trump has yet to take office, but his brand of flawed industrial policy has been on full display since his surprise win in November.
但是，该地区的君主以及世俗独裁者们压制所有的阿拉伯反对派，这意味着“保卫清真寺”成为政治参与的唯一框架。	But repression of all Arab opposition movements by the region’s monarchs and secular dictators meant that “protection of the Mosque” became the only umbrella under which to engage politically.
类似的事件令许多并不像那些纠察队员那般崇敬牛的人们感到危机四伏，还导致对某些群体在经济上陷入了困境。	Such incidents have heightened the sense of vulnerability felt by many who do not necessarily share the vigilantes’ reverence for cows. They have also led to serious economic challenges for some groups.
一份由意大利银行研究员马格达·彼安科（Magda Bianco ） , 西尔维亚·吉阿科迈利（Silvia Giacomelli）和贾科莫·罗丹诺（Giacomo Rodano）共同撰写的报告指出意大利国内依然存在大量阻碍经济扩张的制度性障碍。	Magda Bianco, Silvia Giacomelli, and Giacomo Rodano, researchers at the Bank of Italy, report that these institutional roadblocks to expansion remain substantial in Italy.
所以请忘掉区块链，比特币和其他加密货币，并着手投资于那些拥有真实商业模式的，正在为金融服务业带来革命性冲击的金融科技企业。	So, forget about blockchain, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, and start investing in fintech firms with actual business models, which are slogging away to revolutionize the financial-services industry.
在柏林，尽管很多人担忧犹太人大屠杀纪念馆会遭到亵渎，但是，这一纪念馆的美国设计师彼得·爱森曼对他的设计会被如何评论以及动作并不以为然。	In Berlin, there is much concern about the possible desecration of the Holocaust Memorial, although its author, the American architect Peter Eisenmann, takes a relaxed view of what is said and done about his creation.
考虑到基因改造农产品在健康方面的好处 — — 更不用说其更高也更可靠的产量 — — 各国政府都应当引入法案促进这类基因改造谷物以及其他作物的推广。	Given the health benefits – to say nothing of the often higher and more reliable yields – governments should introduce incentives aimed at increasing use of such genetically engineered grains and other crops.
而因为中国出于自身原因愿意为美国的赤字提供融资，美元和人民币似乎陷入了偏离（misaligned positions ） 。	And because China has been willing, for its own reasons, to finance the US deficit, the dollar and the renminbi now seem to be locked into misaligned positions.
最近的政治漫画画着英国轰炸机起飞执行任务，一名飞行员对旁边的人说 ， “ 轰炸伦敦南部的几个年轻人似乎有很长的路要走 。 ”	A recent political cartoon showed British bombers taking off on a mission, with one pilot saying to the others, “It seems a long way to go to bomb a few young men from South London.”
随着数字化工作平台的影响力不断扩大，美国劳动力本已摇摇欲坠的社会安全网对越来越多的劳动力而言正在四分五裂。	With the proliferation of digital job platforms, the social safety net for workers in the US – threadbare to begin with – is at risk of unraveling for a growing share of the workforce.
法国短期来看不容乐观。 财政赤字超过GDP的6 % ， 贸易逆差，国债占GDP的80 % ， 不过这只比德国和荷兰低一些，比其他欧洲国家都要好。	Of course, unethical behavior by officials – the root of the current crisis – is unacceptable.
作为一个二战后成立的组织，世界货币基金组织最初的作用是在一个固定汇率系统中资助各成员国之间的暂时不平衡，而自从1971年美元固定汇率系统终止之后，该组织也一直在找寻自身存在的意义。	Created after WWII to finance temporary imbalances of the members of a fixed-exchange rate system, the IMF has been in search of a cause since the demise of the dollar exchange-rate system in 1971.
美国的国民债务水平在过去五年里翻了一倍，除非支出和税收的变革得到实施，否则必将在未来十年中突破GDP的100 % 。	America’s national debt has more than doubled in the past five years, and is set to rise to more than 100% of GDP over the next decade unless changes in spending and taxes are implemented.
在东盟成员国必须追加投资重新培训劳动力队伍并为这一新时代开发基础设施的那一刻，国家预算必将受到挑战。	National budgets will be challenged at exactly the moment when ASEAN members must increase their investment in reskilling labor forces and developing infrastructure for this new age.
当然，花1,000美元出席杰克森霍尔会议的金融家和公司高管有不同看法：低工资意味着高利润，低利率意味着高股价。	Of course, the financiers and corporate executives who pay $1,000 to attend the Jackson Hole meeting see things differently: Low wages mean high profits, and low interest rates mean high stock prices.
不管习近平向印度建议“尽快形成边境框架”是劝告还是警告，其他亚洲国家都无法再忽视其自身与中国的边境纠纷了。	Whether Xi’s appeal to India to “settle the boundary framework quickly” was an exhortation or a warning, other Asian countries can no longer afford to ignore their own border disputes with China.
但是对日本而言，正像1972年日中联合公报所表明的那样，中华人民共和国显然取代了台湾中华民国的合法地位，而六年后又在日中联合公报的基础上签署了日中和平友好条约。	But, for Japan, the PRC has clearly succeeded the ROC in Taiwan, as demonstrated by the 1972 Japan-PRC Joint Communiqué, on the basis of which the bilateral Treaty of Peace and Friendship was concluded six years later.
中国官员还声称可能停止对日稀土出口 — — 这是许多日本企业生产所必须的关键原材料 — — 也最终实施了非正式的稀土禁运。	Chinese officials also suggested the possibility of banning exports to Japan of rare-earth elements – raw materials crucial for many Japanese manufacturing processes – and appear to have done so informally.
我和我的同事们所主持的一项经合组织新研究《2018年的脆弱之国 》 （ States of Fragility 2018）试图回答这些关键问题。	These are among the key questions that colleagues and I have attempted to answer in a new OECD study, States of Fragility 2018.
普林斯顿 — — 从智利到德国，西方各国燃起的抗议活动既缺乏思考又缺乏定义，这一点令人感觉十分怪异。	PRINCETON – The protest movements that have flared up across the West, from Chile to Germany, have remained curiously undefined and under-analyzed.
外界对日内瓦会谈几乎不抱什么希望，以致于巴沙尔·阿萨德总统的谈判代表和反对派同坐在一间屋子里（虽然并没有坐在一张桌前）这样微不足道的琐事都被看做是一种成功。	Expectations for the Geneva talks are so low that trivial matters – such as the fact that President Bashar al-Assad’s negotiators and the opposition are sitting together in the same room (though not at the same table) – are being hailed as successes.
将公债保持在中低水平是很重要的，因为债务水平一旦达到GDP的80-90 % ， 将会严重拖累经济的增长。	Having low to moderate levels of public debt is important, because debt levels that reach 80-90% of GDP become a serious drag on economic growth.
在一篇测算垄断力的经济效应的最新论文中，我对正常水平（normal levels）进行了估算，在这个水平之上的利润和股票估值，便不属于纯粹的机会事件，而是垄断力的反映。	In a recent paper measuring the economic effects of monopoly power, I approximated normal levels above which profits or stock values are not purely chance events, but rather reflective of monopoly power.
最近，加拿大政府以34亿美元向得克萨斯州能源企业金德尔摩根公司（Kinder Morgan）购买了一条已有65年历史的管道，以确保这一该公司认为风险过大的扩张计划。	Most recently, the government stepped in and paid the Texas-based energy firm Kinder Morgan $3.4 billion for a 65-year-old pipeline in order to ensure its planned expansion, which the company had deemed too risky.
马里的 人口十分多样化：北方分布着沙漠游牧部落，主要是图阿雷格人（Tuareg ） ， 南方分布着占据多数的定居黑人。	Mali’s population is diverse: desert nomads, notably Tuaregs, in the north, and a majority of sedentary black populations in the south.
无论如何，土耳其缺少快速制造核武器的知识和技术基础，并且需要很长时间 — — 有可能是十年以上 — — 发展这一能力。	In any case, Turkey lacks the know-how and technical infrastructure to produce a nuclear weapon quickly, and the country would need a long time – probably more than a decade – to develop this capacity.
而国际上的善意的支持可能是他是否能取得成功的关键，这种成功如果不是在重新建立美国霸权方面，那么至少是在使美国重新成为一个“不可或缺的国家 ” 。	International goodwill will probably be the key to his success, if not in re-establishing American hegemony, then at least in making America the “indispensable nation” once more.
与此同时，粮农组织估计全球8.7亿人 — — 其中90%生活在发展中国家 — — 受困于慢性营养不良症。	At the same time, the FAO estimates that 870 million people worldwide – 90% of them living in developing countries – suffer chronic undernourishment.
原则上，德国可以通过增加杠杆提振内需；但是，除非汇率向上调整从而在边际上抑制可贸易部门，否则这会造成通货膨胀。	In principle, Germany could try to boost domestic demand by leveraging up; but, unless the exchange rate adjusts upward to shrink the tradable sector at the margin, doing so would be inflationary.
许多知名经济学家 — — 包括由诺贝尔奖获得者斯蒂格利茨领衔的联合国专家委员会成员们 — — 建议用“全球储备体系”代替美元独大的现状。	Many prominent economists, including the members of a United Nations panel headed by the Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, are recommending a “Global Reserve System” to replace the dollar’s hegemony.
其后随着市场机制在中国的引入及发展，催生了价格双轨制，使得那些有能力获得产品配额的人只需支付较低的价格。	As the free market developed, a dual-price system emerged, in which those with access to quota-allocated goods paid less.
在所有这些例子中，经济失败以及穷人和年轻人看不见机会和希望助长了政治和宗教极端主义和对西方的仇恨，一些国家甚至因此兴起了恐怖主义。	In all of these cases, economic failure and a lack of opportunities and hope for the poor and young are fueling political and religious extremism, resentment of the West and, in some cases, outright terrorism.
市政领导人还与本地企业合作，将资源用于促进企业家精神和移民工作培训。 在新西兰奥克兰，三分之一的人口出生于国外。	Collaborating with local businesses, municipal leaders have also channeled resources toward promoting entrepreneurship and work training for migrants.
的确，许多印度官员发现与巴基斯坦平民政府举行和谈非常令人沮丧 — — 因为只有军方才有资格在巴基斯坦发号施令 — — 导致平民政府似乎不愿或无法兑现其诺言。	It is true that many Indian officials have found it frustrating to talk peace to a civilian government that – because the military calls the shots in Pakistan – seems unable or unwilling to deliver on any commitments.
但对该地区最近形势发展的另一种解释认为首先后共产主义改革作为加入欧盟的条件，在很大程度上是由外部因素左右的。	But another explanation of recent developments in the region begins by noting that post-communist reforms were largely dictated from outside, as a condition of admission to the European Union.
本质上，虽然伊拉克的所有政治派别都非常有兴趣建立一个表面上拥有全部职能的中央政府，这样的政府实际上权力有限。	In essence, while all of Iraq’s factions have a strong interest in promoting a central government that appears fully functional, that government’s powers will in fact be limited.
例如，1990到2015年间，非洲民众平均预期寿命增加、婴儿死亡率减半、中学入学率飙升，而基础设施方面的差距也得到了改善。	For example, between 1990 and 2015, average life expectancy increased, infant mortality rates were halved, secondary school enrollment soared, and infrastructure gaps narrowed.
但是，尽管左翼联盟（Syriza）的胜利导致希腊股票和债券跳水，但没有迹象表明暴跌会传染给欧元区其他受困外围国家。	But, though the Syriza party’s victory sent Greek equities and bonds plummeting, there is little sign of contagion to other distressed countries on the eurozone periphery.
内塔尼亚胡甚至可能将伊扎克·赫尔佐格的犹太复国主义联盟融入其政府，从而为摇摇欲坠的执政联盟争取支持。	Netanyahu may even succeed in bringing Yitzhak Herzog’s Zionist Union into his government, thereby shoring up his shaky coalition.
本文作者之一参与编写新书《中国未来：佛山模式 》 （ China’s Evolving Growth Model: The Story of Foshan ） ， 对其中一个已经步入高收入的先锋城市，广东省的佛山市，展开了详细的案例研究。	A new book, China’s Evolving Growth Model: The Story of Foshan (coauthored by one of us), offers a case study of one of those cities.
国家电力公司必须务实灵活 — — 愿意与独立个体电力生产商合作 — — 并启用智能电网来更好地管理供给和需求。	National power utilities must become nimble – willing to work with independent and individual power producers – and enable smart grids that can better manage supply and demand.
作为回报，沙皮洛则向以色列神谕党的极端犹太正统派领导人递交了一份前往白宫的邀请函，而阿巴斯也从米切尔手里得到了类似的一份信函。	In exchange, Shapiro handed the ultra-orthodox leader of Israel’s Shas party an invitation to the White House. Mitchell gave a similar invitation to Abbas.
因此，我的组织格雷米恩基金会（Grameen Foundation）运用数字技术和移动电话将储蓄组织和其他服务提供者联系在一起。	That is why my organization, the Grameen Foundation, is using digital technology and mobile phones to connect savings groups with other service providers.
一些欧盟成员国 — — 包括奥地利、匈牙利、斯洛文尼亚、西班牙、法国以及最初欢迎移民的丹麦和瑞典 — — 的应对措施是事实暂停了申根协定，重新开启边境控制。	Some EU members, including Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Spain, France, and the initially welcoming Denmark and Sweden, have reacted by practically suspending the Schengen Agreement and reinstating border controls.
“通过移民实现人口年轻化是一个无底洞 ， ” 他说 ， “ 要保持赡养比一次性的下降需要移民永无止尽地保持流入。	“Rejuvenation through immigration is an endless treadmill,” he says. “To maintain a once-and-for-all reduction in the dependency ratio requires a never-ending stream of immigrants.
获得教育、资本、市场和技术能让妇女处理、打包和推销她们的产品，特别是面向非洲不断增加的中产阶级，从而同时改善收入和粮食供给。	Access to education, capital, markets, and technologies would allow women to process, package, and market their products, especially for Africa’s growing middle class, bolstering both earnings and food supplies.
在像德国这样的国家，在恐怖袭击和民粹主义政治言论的驱使之下，社会对移民的抵制可能会降低这种方案的吸引力。	Social resistance to immigration in a country like Germany, fueled by terrorist attacks and populist political rhetoric, could undermine the appeal of such a program.
第三种选择，或许也是赞同人数最多的选择，是撤到掩体背后束手无策，为从天堂被放逐而恸哭不已，为即将到来的末日而忧心忡忡。	The third, comprising perhaps the largest camp, is to retreat below deck and wring one’s hands, bemoaning the expulsion from paradise and fearful of a looming apocalypse.
在这次访问中，我得以出席与他和其他伊朗高层领导人的会晤，包括伊朗外交部长、后来在维也纳谈判中担任伊朗首席谈判员的扎里夫（Mohammad Zarif ） 。	During that visit, I was able to attend meetings with him and other top Iranian leaders, including Mohammad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister and, later, its chief negotiator in the negotiations in Vienna.
中国急切地建设新坝的计划注定要引起亚洲关系动荡，引发水的更大竞争，妨碍已然进展缓慢的地区合作和一体化的制度化进程。	China’s rush to build more dams promises to roil relations across Asia, fostering greater competition for water and impeding the already slow progress toward institutionalizing regional cooperation and integration.
尽管如此，蓬勃发展的美国经济至少应当让那些赞成用狭隘的经济因素来解读当前民粹主义浪潮的人停下来想一想。	Still, the booming US economy should at least give pause to those who favor the narrowly economic interpretation of the current wave of populism.
在那些降低了家庭让女童接受教育的成本的国家（不论是通过免学费还是为女童入学提供补贴 ） ， 女童的入学率都增加了。	In countries where the family’s cost of schooling girls is lowered either by a no-fee policy or by a stipend for girls who enroll in school, girls’ enrollment rate increases.
其中最广为人知的是E·怀特·巴克（E. Wight Bakke ） — —此君当时还是位研究生，后来成为耶鲁大学经济学教授 — — 对康涅狄格州纽黑文市长期失业的研究。	The most famous such study, of the long-term unemployed in New Haven, Connecticut, was conducted by E. Wight Bakke, a graduate student and subsequently a professor of economics at Yale University.
病人的知情同意通常不能为非劣效性试验提供一个清晰的描述。 而且缺乏附加值意味着在很多情况下新药的研发是被商业目的而非病人需求所驱动。	Patients’ informed consent usually does not provide a clear description of a non-inferiority trial, and the lack of added value indicates that in many cases the development of a new drug is driven by commercial aims rather than patients’ needs.
萨拉姆·法耶兹这位精力充沛而又受过西方训练的巴勒斯坦总理正在努力描绘一张细节化的蓝图，力促在2011年8月宣布巴勒斯坦国的事实成立。	Salam Fayyad, the energetic Western-trained Palestinian prime minister, has implemented a detailed blueprint for declaring a de facto Palestinian state by August 2011.
但是，如果没有美国的军事支持或间接（在某些情形中是隐藏的）政治支持，你很难想象英国、法国和以色列会做出这些高风险动作。	Yet, without direct US military support or indirect (and in some cases implicit) political support, it is difficult to imagine that such risky operations would have been launched.
事实上，马克龙胜出可能形成对当前席卷全球的民粹主义趋势的反制，因为这将燃起所有左翼和右翼同情者的希望，同时引起民粹主义和狂热民族主义的焦虑。	Indeed, a Macron victory could launch a counter-trend to the populism that is sweeping the globe, by giving hope to all who are sympathetic to the left or right, but anxious about populism and hyper-nationalism.
所以，几乎所有的拉丁美洲都深受美国当前的移民环境的影响，并且，都会从约翰·麦凯恩和巴拉克·奥巴马都支持的那种全面移民政策改革中，受益巨大。	So almost all of Latin America is deeply affected by the current immigration climate in the US, and would benefit greatly from the type of comprehensive immigration reform that both John McCain and Barack Obama have supported.
蔡还要等四个月才能就职，因此马政府在此期间的所作所为可能是决定性的 — — 特别是如果他不顾选举失利继续与中国合作。	Tsai will not be inaugurated for another four months, so how the Ma government behaves in the interim could be decisive – especially if he ignores his electoral rebuke and continues to make overtures to China.
但陈还不是与克林顿抢镜的唯一因素；她的老板总统奥巴马也盖过了她的风头，奥巴马午夜时分在喀布尔降落，与阿富汗签订战略协议，并在黎明到来前返回美国。	But Chen was not the only one to upstage Clinton; her boss, President Barack Obama, did so as well, landing at midnight in Kabul, where he executed a strategic pact with Afghanistan, flying back to the US before dawn.
世界银行应当能够在没有中央政权担保的情况下与它们合作，并增加用当地货币提供的贷款，这是因为这些合作伙伴无法承受货币风险。	The Bank should be able to work with them in the absence of sovereign guarantees, and increase its loan offerings in local currencies, since these partners cannot afford currency risk.
2008年时各国政府手中还握有防止经济自由落体式下跌所需的政策工具，而必须直面下一次经济衰退的政策制定者却将受到束缚，而且总体债务水平还要高于上次危机期间。	Unlike in 2008, when governments had the policy tools needed to prevent a free fall, the policymakers who must confront the next downturn will have their hands tied while overall debt levels are higher than during the previous crisis.
可以肯定，不存在量化信任赤字的正式数据，因为该地区剩下的基督徒太少，导致已经无法进行有意义的数据比对工作。	To be sure, there are no official data quantifying the deficit; in most parts of the Middle East, too few Christians are left to make meaningful statistical comparisons.
虚弱的土地权利可能限制农民得不到农作物保险，导致他们的孩子难以在学校注册就读，甚至可能导致更高的自杀率。	Weak land rights can limit farmers’ access to crop insurance, make it difficult for their children to register for school, and can even contribute to higher rates of suicide.
在一宗证据确凿的案件中，某军事基地的一位为葛兰运动卖命的无关军官因为印制意在抹黑其他军官的材料而被抓获。	In one well-documented case, a non-commissioned officer at a military base, acting on behalf of the Gülen movement, was caught planting documents in order to embarrass military officials.
IMF的另一个失误是没有充分认识到资本流应该在“两端”同时监管，或者说，至少发达国家的监管没有让事情更糟。	The IMF also fails to appreciate fully that capital flows should be regulated at “both ends,” or at least that advanced-country regulations will not make matters worse.
这些是我在不久前访问贝宁、加纳、埃塞俄比亚、埃及、纳米比亚、尼日利亚、塞内加尔和南非等国家时亲眼所见。	I’ve seen this for myself during recent travels to Benin, Ghana, Ethiopia, Egypt, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa.
NIE还确认了一直指导欧洲外交策略的两种假设：伊朗会对外部的积极和消极因素做出回应，考虑伊朗人的合法利益是对伊朗领导人施加影响的最佳方式。	The NIE also confirmed two assumptions that have since guided European diplomatic approach: Iran reacts to external incentives and disincentives, and taking legitimate Iranian interests into consideration is the best way to influence Iran’s leaders.
现有的改革未能充分缓解这一风险，主要是因为它们需要依赖当局和各家银行在某家银行破产后48小时内完成复杂而未经测试的还款流程。	Existing reforms do not adequately mitigate this risk, largely because they depend on the authorities and the banks to complete a complex and untested repayment process within 48 hours of a bank’s collapse.
我们拥有正义的事业和很多潜在的盟友，但如果不能将硬性和软性力量结合成明智的策略，将可能给我们带来致命的打击。	We have a just cause and many potential allies, but our failure to combine hard and soft power into a smart strategy could be fatal.
曾记得当年许多国家代表团启程奔赴日本京都之时，都是准备好了要接受对温室气体排放征税，至少是对二氧化碳这种最常见的温室气体征税这一理念的。	One might recall that many delegations arrived in Kyoto resignedly willing to accept the idea of a tax on greenhouse-gas emissions, or at least on carbon dioxide, the most commonly encountered greenhouse gas.
现在的情况是，普京已经牢牢掌握了在这个国家占压倒地位的统一俄罗斯党，决定作为这个党名列首位的候选人参加11月份的议会选举。	As it happens, Putin is now entrenching the already dominant United Russia party by his decision to head the party’s candidate list in December’s parliamentary election.
比如按照诺贝尔奖得主罗伯特·福格尔的说法，工业革命以来医学及营养学的进步加速并主导了人类进化，使现代人与智人有了本质上的不同。	For example, according to Nobel laureate Robert Fogel, medical and nutritional advances since the Industrial Revolution have accelerated and directed the evolutionary process, making modern humans a fundamentally different species from Homo sapiens.
的确，在与中国电视人共事的过程中，我发现了一种微妙的，近乎本能的避免任何特别、新颖、非正统，更别说是颠覆性的内容的倾向。	Indeed, working daily with Chinese TV creators, I noticed a subtle, almost instinctive tendency to avoid any content or format that is unusual, novel, or unorthodox, never mind subversive.
在2005年联合国召开的上一次“五年评估大会”上，只有以色列、印度、巴基斯坦和北朝鲜没有出席—前三个国家拥有先进的核武库，而第四个则正在成形中。	In the last five-year review conference at the United Nations in 2005, only Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea were not participating – the first three have nuclear arsenals that are advanced, and the fourth’s is embryonic.
奥尼尔最近对《中国日报》表示 ： “ 南非加入金砖国家何其幸运，因为从经济上讲，它与其他四国相比规模相当小 。 ”	As O’Neill recently told China Daily, “South Africa is quite fortunate enough to be in the group, as, economically, it is rather small compared to the others.”
一段时间以来，美国和国外许多人已经相信了美国衰落的神话，越来越依赖能源进口往往被视为美国衰落的证据。	For some time, many people in the US and abroad have bought into the myth of American decline. Increasing dependence on energy imports was often cited as evidence.
像埃及政府那样利用暴徒实行广泛恐吓绝非吉兆，专制政权对几十万普通埃及民众以和平抗议为主的运动进行了暴力歪曲。	Resorting to thugs to carry out widespread intimidation, and blaming violence on the largely peaceful protests of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Egyptians, as their government has done, is not a good omen.
法国人感叹欧洲其他国家对其马里和中非共和国行动给予的支持微乎其微 — — 德国拒绝设立欧盟成员国行动基金就是最好的例子。	The French have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of Europe for its operations in Mali and the Central African Republic – exemplified by Germany’s refusal to create a fund for EU member-state operations.
此外，自从哈马斯掌权以来，法塔赫对这一新巴勒斯坦统治者的挑战进一步升级。 其背后是从美国和欧洲获得的慷慨财政支持和来自于美国及阿拉伯国家的大量武器供应。	Moreover, since Hamas’s rise to power, Fatah’s challenge to the new Palestinian rulers was enhanced by lavish financial support it secured from the United States and Europe, and by a generous supply of weapons from both the US and Arab countries.
前财政部长拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）和经济顾问委员会前任主席贾森·弗尔曼（Jason Furman）曾就我们的结论提出了一些技术性问题。	Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Jason Furman, raised several technical questions about our conclusions.
随着这些机器人的能力不断进化 — — 从协助病人下床到为残疾和抑郁人士提供理疗疗程和情感救助 — — 他们所做的将会继续被重新定义，	And what they do will continue to be redefined as those robots’ capabilities evolve from getting patients out of bed to giving physical therapy sessions and providing emotional succor to the depressed and disabled.
例如，中国政府在利比亚危机中一如既往地重申了不干涉内政的外交原则，但却批准了联合国对卡扎菲政府的制裁决议。	For example, the Chinese government reiterated its core diplomatic principle of non-intervention in other countries’ affairs during the Libya crisis, yet China accepted the imposition of United Nations’ sanctions on Muammar Qaddafi’s government.
要想使他的目的以及未来政策拥有神圣的光辉，需要关注他如何行动 — — 关注他的所作所为，而不是他的言辞。	To divine his intentions and future policies requires focusing on his actions – what he does, not what he says.
因此，在许多政策问题上，所有人的目光都集中在众议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）身上，他可能成为制衡克林顿的力量 — — 有时候与克林顿合作，也可能为特朗普指引方向，成为他的经常性伙伴。	As a result, on many policy issues, all eyes will be on House Speaker Paul Ryan, who would likely operate either as a counterbalance – and occasional partner – to Clinton, or as a guide and more regular partner for Trump.
比如，在巴西，公民社会代表占据了国家粮食和营养安全委员会（National Council on Food and Nutrition Security）的三分之二席位，因此有机会影响最高层的决策。	In Brazil, for example, civil-society representatives comprise two-thirds of the National Council on Food and Nutrition Security, and thus have the opportunity to influence policymaking at the highest level.
当南非一流的黑人免疫学家马克沟巴(Malegapuru Makgoba)教授警告��贝基总统的政策会使南非成为世界科学界的笑柄时，姆贝基办公室指责他是在为种族主义的西方观点辩护。	When Professor Malegapuru Makgoba, South Africa’s leading black immunologist, warned that the president’s policies would make South Africa a laughingstock in the world of science, Mbeki’s office accused him of defending racist Western ideas.
1994年种族灭绝前夕，卢旺达米勒·柯林斯自由广播电视台（Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines）用同样的词汇描述图西族人��一如当年朱利乌斯·施特赖歇尔（Julius Streicher）的纳粹报纸《先锋报 》 （ Der Stürmer）描述犹太人。	Rwanda’s Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines used the same word to describe Tutsis in the run-up to the 1994 genocide, as did Julius Streicher’s Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer to describe Jews.
马斯克发现，诀窍在于以长期可盈利和可持续的方式解决这些需要，接着，当找到有益的商业方案时，合作推动它的大规模部署。	As Musk has found out, the trick is to address those needs in ways that are profitable and sustainable in the long run, and then, when a beneficial business solution is identified, to work together to facilitate its large-scale deployment.
军队和穆斯林兄弟会冲突的原因不仅仅是宗教问题，而是充斥着整个阿拉伯社会的社会问题，其中就包括不平等性问题。	Underlying the contradiction between the military and the Muslim Brotherhood is not only the question of religion, but also all of the social problems, including inequality, that riddle Arab societies.
这反过来鼓励了企业更多地使用污染更严重的煤 — — 在全球变暖问题上危害最大的燃料 — — 而如果气候变化政策依然是以价格机制为的基础的话，这一切都不会发生。	This, in turn, has encouraged greater reliance on highly polluting coal – the worst energy source, from the standpoint of global warming. That would not have happened if the price mechanism still underpinned climate-change policy.
20世纪40年代的巴尔干移民、1956年的匈牙利移民，1973年军事政变后的智利移民，1979年革命有的伊朗移民 … … 几十年来，瑞典工业一直依赖移民工人。	People came from the Baltic countries in the 1940s, Hungary in 1956, Chile after the 1973 coup, and Iran after the 1979 revolution. For decades, Swedish industry was dependent on immigrant workers.
他认为动物只是机灵的机械装置，我们不应该把它们的嚎叫和挣扎视为痛苦的表现，就像我们不应该把闹钟的响声作为闹钟有意识的表现一样。	Animals, he maintained, are merely ingenious mechanisms, and we should not take their cries and struggles as a sign of pain, any more than we take the sound of an alarm clock as a sign that it has consciousness.
巴厘岛 — “ 今天，发生经常项目赤字是一种犯罪，这太疯狂了 。 ” 新加坡副总理尚曼达（Tharman Shanmugaratnam）在本月国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行巴厘岛年度会议上哀叹。	BALI – “Today it is a sin to run a current-account deficit, and that is crazy,” lamented Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam at the annual gathering of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in Bali this month.
“我们要收回控制权”是脱欧分子的获胜口号，其中所表达的情感显然与支持脱欧的微弱多数英国选民是有共鸣的。	“Let’s take back control” was the Brexiteers’ winning slogan, expressing a sentiment that clearly resonated with the slim majority of British voters who supported withdrawal from the EU.
20世纪60年代，法国财政部长德斯坦（Valéry Giscard d’Estaing）就有过著名的批评，他称美元的地位让美国拥有了“过度特权 ” 。	In the 1960s, French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing famously condemned the “exorbitant privilege” that the dollar’s status bestowed upon the United States.
此外，乐施会（Oxfam）和无国界医生（Medecins Sans Frontières）等私人出资组织配置资源的效率高于政府，真正做到了将援助送到最需要的人手里。	Moreover, privately funded organizations like Oxfam or Medecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) tend to allocate resources more effectively than governments, delivering genuine gains where they are needed most.
在阿根廷，30%的通胀率、大规模腐败丑闻加上外汇购买限制才让马克里的中右翼政党在最近的总统选举中险胜。	In Argentina, it took a 30% inflation rate, massive corruption scandals, and restrictions on foreign-currency purchases to bring about a slim majority for the center-right Mauricio Macri in the recent presidential election.
若能如此，中国将更有可能改善其法律制度、增加政治问责、强化私人产权保护、让政府真正“为人民服务 ” （ 毛泽东语 ） 。	At that point, China will have a better chance of improving its legal institutions, increasing political accountability, strengthening protection of private property rights, and making the government genuinely – in Mao’s words – “serve the people.”
现在还不太可能知道像文特尔的JCVI-syn 3.0这样的合成有机物还是基因编辑技术将主导生物技术的商业应用 — — 或者实质上这两种方法都将被其他某种方法所取代。	It is impossible to know whether synthetic organisms like Venter’s JCVI-syn 3.0 or gene-editing techniques will prove to be commercially dominant in biotechnology – or indeed whether some other method will supplant both.
例如，最近一项研究结果显示，在54名接受大脑半球切除术切除半个大脑用以治疗严重和顽固性癫痫的儿童当中，除4人外均表现出相同甚至更好的智力。	For example, a recent study showed that all but four of 54 children who underwent a hemispherectomy, in which half the brain is removed to treat severe and intractable epilepsy, showed the same or even improved intellectual capacity.
受危机影响的远远不只希腊：无序破产可能把欧盟南部周边经济体（包括某些大国在内）拖入财政深渊，而主要欧洲银行和保险公司也将同时倒下。	The crisis was always about much more than Greece: a disorderly insolvency there would threaten to pull other economies on the EU’s southern periphery, including some very big ones, into the fiscal abyss, along with major European banks and insurers.
欧洲政客认为引入环境保护机制会影响已经相当疲软的欧盟经济，因此，毫不奇怪遏制空气污染的措施远远达不到要求。	With European politicians arguing that introducing environmental safeguards will hurt the EU’s already-weakened economy, it comes as little surprise that measures to limit air pollution fall far short of the mark.
毫不奇怪，这加剧了通胀担忧，1月份消费者物价指数（CPI）同比涨幅仅0.8 % ， 而生产者物价降幅扩大至4.3 % 。	Unsurprisingly, this has exacerbated the fear of deflation, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising by just 0.8% year on year in January, and the annual decline in producer prices steepening, to 4.3%.
20世纪70年代美国决定让美元浮动时，IMF��乎被晾在一旁，直到1982年墨西哥债务危机才得到了救赎，这场危机让IMF成为全球金融卫士。	It was almost made redundant in the 1970s, when the US floated the dollar, only to be saved in 1982 by the Mexican debt crisis, which propelled it into the role of global financial lifeguard.
比如，克林顿是第三位美国女国务卿，但她是第一位感觉自己地位足够安全，能够引领全球妇女和女孩运动的女国务卿。	Clinton, for example, was the third woman US Secretary of State but the first who felt secure enough to be able to champion the cause of women and girls worldwide.
拜两个多世纪的持续增长所赐，经合组织国家平均人均GDP已接近40,000美元，分别比拉丁美洲、南亚和撒哈拉以南非洲高3.3、11.3和17.7倍。	Thanks to more than two centuries of sustained growth, average per capita income in the OECD countries is just under $40,000 – 3.3, 11.3, and 17.7 times more than in Latin America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, respectively.
在中国国外，商界领袖普遍持有的观点是习近平主席的新政府已经巩固了权力，并获得了足够的权威来推行深刻的经济改革。	Outside China, the prevalent view among business leaders is that President Xi Jinping’s new administration has consolidated its power and acquired enough authority to push through far-reaching economic reforms.
由持续低利率所引发的南欧国家通胀信贷泡沫削弱了这些国家的竞争力，并将资产和房产价格推高到了不可持续的高水平。	The inflationary credit bubble spurred in southern European countries by the persistence of lower interest rates undermined their competitiveness and drove asset and property prices to unsustainably high levels.
但英国国际发展部的一项研究表明千禧村仅产生了“微弱的积极效应 ” ， 而对“消除贫困的整体影响不大 ” 。	But a study by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development shows the villages had “moderately positive impacts,” and “little overall impact on poverty.”
但是没有人知道中国的婴儿脚步是不是更有力措施的前奏，而中国的领导人前一天还在这样暗示，第二天又予以否认。	But no one knows whether China’s baby step is the start of something much bigger, as China’s authorities hint one day and deny the next.
这适用于针对中国或俄罗斯等主要行动方的外交动作、制裁机制、国际协定，以及欧洲卫星导航系统伽利略等战略计划。	This applies to démarches regarding major actors like China or Russia, sanctions regimes, international agreements, and strategic programs like Galileo, the European satellite navigation system.
欧盟三国 — — 英国、法国和德国 — — 正试图劝说伊朗放弃它的浓缩核计划，该计划将使得它在迅速退出条约后获得可使用的核弹材料。	Three European Union countries – Britain, France, and Germany – are trying to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear enrichment program, which would give it bomb material to use after a quick withdrawal from the treaty.
欧盟正站在关键性的历史分隔点上，我们需要有自己的东向支点 — — 建立在欧洲的优势上的明确果断的亚洲战略。	The European Union is at a critical historical juncture, one that demands its own pivot eastward – a coherent and decisive Asian strategy that builds on Europe’s strengths.
问题在于2005年法国针对欧盟宪法的全民公投否决了政治一体化进程的深入，而经济一体化进程的深入则可能因为德国的犹豫而陷入失败。	The problem is that the French referendum on the EU constitution in 2005 vetoed further political integration, while further economic integration may now fail because of Germany.
其次，只有在债务最小化 — — 也就是说，当资产增值的资本收益高于利息支出之时 — — 财富效应才会最大化。	Second, wealth effects are maximized when debt service is minimized – that is, when interest expenses do not swallow the capital gains of asset appreciation.
随着巴基斯坦和总统穆沙拉夫的前景因为贝·布托的遇刺而变得不确定起来，人们开始联想起1979年发生在伊朗的国王被驱赶下台和伊斯兰革命。	As the future of both Pakistan and its president, Pervez Musharraf, wallow in uncertainty in the wake of Benazir Bhutto’s assassination, parallels are being drawn to the 1979 fall of the Shah and the Islamic Revolution in Iran.
7月，波罗申科剥夺了格鲁吉亚前总统米哈伊尔·萨卡什维利（Mikhail Saakashvili）的乌克兰公民身份，而后者正是由波洛申科邀请到乌克兰并于2015年被任命为敖德萨省长的。	In July, Poroshenko stripped the citizenship of Mikhail Saakashvili, the former President of Georgia whom Poroshenko invited to Ukraine and appointed governor of Odessa in 2015.
到目前为止，随着总统选举委员会的负责人在埃及电视上宣布拒绝对选举过程实施全民监督，形势似乎进入了一个平局。	Thus far, a standoff looks likely, as the head of the presidential election commission has stated publicly on Egyptian television that he refuses all citizen monitoring of the election process.
自数字媒体和社交媒体问世以来，新闻周期被缩短为仅仅几分钟，鼓励媒体去生产那些有失准确，耸人听闻，虚假或偏见极深的内容。	Since the advent of digital and social media, the news cycle has been shortened to minutes, encouraging a continuous flow of imprecise, sensational, false, or deeply biased content.
最令人鼓舞的是，一场新的大型国际惠东正在让政策焦点转向使用核武器带来的可怕的人道主义灾难并制造��成全面禁止核武器条约的条件。	Most encouraging of all, a major new international movement is gathering pace to focus policy attention on the horrific humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons, and to create the conditions for a treaty to ban them once and for all.
合规成本过高（特别是对于小型银行而言 ） ， 而对那些“太大而不能倒”的机构进行压力测试的初始门槛 — — 资产规模达500亿美元 — — 又太低。	Compliance costs were excessive, especially for small banks, and the original threshold for stress-testing “too big to fail” institutions – $50 billion in assets – was too low.
巴黎气候协定包括一个将全球变暖幅度限制在“显著低于前工业化水平以上2摄氏度”的承诺（pledge ） 。	The Paris climate agreement includes a pledge to keep warming “well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.”
美国并非这一错误计算的唯一例外，我和费德里克·斯图尔泽尼格（Federico Sturzenegger）指出，差异是系统性的，并且规模很大。	The US is not the only exception in this miscalculation, and the gaps are systematic and large, as Federico Sturzenegger and I have shown.
这一政策的作用是让化石燃料失去经济上的竞争力 — — 并创造激励促使哥斯达黎加交通部门几乎100%使用可再生电力，以降低石油依赖。	This policy has the effect of rendering fossil fuels economically uncompetitive – and creating incentives to use Costa Rica’s nearly 100% renewable power in the transportation sector to cut our dependence on oil.
相比之下，像中国这样的新兴市场，合约网络尚没有那么成熟。 然而，随着时间推移，尤其是通过参与国际贸易，新兴市场国家也会发展出越来越复杂的合约网络及系统性的关联结构。	By contrast, emerging markets like China have less sophisticated systems and evolve more complex contractual/institutional links over time, particularly through globalized transactions.
对于许多行业来说，如果要在世界经济论坛的克劳斯·施瓦布（Klaus Schwab）所谓的第四次工业革命中保全自己，就意味着要对科技进行规管。	For many industries, navigating what the World Economic Forum’s Klaus Schwab has called the Fourth Industrial Revolution means regulating technology.
但它面临着严重的障碍：首先是有限的体制和人力资源的潜力 — — 这一约束可能会阻碍国内创新和有效资源分配。	But it faces serious obstacles, beginning with limited institutional and human capabilities – a constraint that could hinder domestic innovation and efficient resource allocation.
世贸组织香港回合会议即将开始，让我们设想一下如果来自世界各地的贸易部长们离开谈判桌时做出如下声明 ： “ 我们这次没能达成协议，我们下次会争取做得更好 。 ”	Imagine that the world’s trade ministers simply walk away from their forthcoming Hong Kong meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) with this simple declaration: “We failed to reach an agreement; we’ll try to do better next time.”
纳税人和政府不得不出手援助债权人，即使援助会鼓励过度冒险的行为也在所不惜，因为他们害怕倒闭产生毁灭性效应会蔓延开来。	Taxpayers and governments alike are tired of bailing out creditors for fear of the destructive contagious effects of failure – even as bailouts encourage excessive risk taking.
技术让真正意义上的象棋全球化得到了实现，印度的Vishy Anand是首个亚裔世界冠军，帅气的小伙子Norwegian Magnus Carlson已经具备摇滚明星水准。 自此人机慢慢形成了一种共生状态。	Imagine, someday you might actually prefer digital to human operators.
智利也是一个忠实的自由贸易国，与20多个国家签订了自由贸易协定，也是新生的跨太平洋伙伴关系中的一员。	Chile is also a devoted free trader. It has free-trade agreements with more than 20 countries and is a member of the nascent Trans-Pacific Partnership.
在美国，美联储主席伯南克完美地在最近的经济大减速中演绎了弗里德曼主义，结果是如此并不足以保护经济或快速使之快速恢复充分就业。	In the United States, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has executed the Friedmanite playbook flawlessly in the current downturn, and it has not been enough to preserve or rapidly restore full employment.
在这一大背景下，采取升级经济体制所需的措施，包括改善美国的基础设施以及完善欧洲尚未完成构建的联盟，或是应对难民危机这类自古有之的挑战，似乎全都变得不太可能了。	In this context, taking the steps needed to upgrade economic systems, including infrastructure in the US and the incomplete union in Europe, or to meet historical challenges like the refugee crisis, seems all but impossible.
这一增幅发生在个人收入占中国经济比重大幅增加的背景下。 服务业拉动的就业增长以及城市化的收入杠杆效应使得个人收入占中国经济比重大增。	This has occurred despite a significant increase in the personal income share of the Chinese economy, driven by services-led employment growth and the income leverage of urbanization.
在秘鲁，尽管党派结构薄弱，但阿兰·加西亚（Alan García）首个总统任期期间的恶性通胀教训为国家带来了随后25年的宏观经济稳定。	In Peru, the lessons of hyperinflation during Alan García’s first presidency have underpinned 25 years of macroeconomic stability, despite a weak party structure.
最后，正如诺贝尔奖经济学奖得主迈克尔·斯宾塞所展示的那样，增长如今已经成为创造就业的一个必要但不充分条件。	Finally, as the Nobel laureate economist Michael Spence has shown, growth is now a necessary but insufficient condition for job creation.
卡钦斯基渴望一场压倒性的胜利，而他知道他和国防部长安东尼·马切雷维奇是波兰政界最不受民众欢迎和信任的人物。	Kaczyński wants an overwhelming victory, and he knows that he, along with Antoni Macierewicz, the defense minister, is one of Poland’s least popular or trusted politicians.
任何经验丰富的银行家都知道，管理良好的银行应该将定期进行内部“压力测试”作为良好的企业管理的一部分。	As any seasoned banker knows, a well-managed bank should undertake internal “stress tests” regularly as a matter of good housekeeping.
贾尼是前世界银行高级官员，他不但有意寻求伊斯兰极端主义问题的持久解决之道，也试图将阿富汗引上可持续经济发展之路。	A former senior World Bank official, Ghani is interested not only in finding a durable solution to the problem of Islamic extremism, but also in setting his country on a path of sustainable economic development.
共和党在财政方针一致性方面的肤浅承诺如今已经露出马脚，因为他们主张大幅削减企业和巨富阶层的税收，而这将导致在未来十年内增加一万亿美元的赤字。	The Republicans’ shallow commitment to fiscal rectitude is now being exposed as they advocate massive tax cuts for corporations and billionaires that will add one and half trillion dollars to the deficit over the next decade.
从那以后，我看到两个相关联的概念在越来越多的市场上流行：基于时间的定价以及对所谓“消逝性资产”的更有效利用 — — “消逝性资产”指的是那些只有被使用才能产生收益的生产资料。	Over the years, I watched as more and more markets picked up two related concepts: time-based pricing and more efficient use of so-called “vanishing assets” – or capital goods that generate revenue only as they are used.
所有债权人都接受了这一条件，除了一小撮顽固派 — — 他们廉价收购剩余债券，然后诉诸法庭要求足额偿付，美国纽约南区地方法院受理了此案。	All, that is, except for a few holdouts who bought up the remaining bonds on the cheap and went to court, specifically to the US District Court of the Southern District of New York, asking to be paid in full.
在缅甸，我们看到了另外一种模式-几十年来，他们以一种既受控制同时又带有目的性的方式进行军事运动，现在是一种大胆的尝试，力图建立一个包容性的新政府。	In Burma, we see another model – a bold attempt after decades of military rule to move in a controlled but purposeful way toward a new, inclusive form of government. Here there are striking similarities to what happened in Poland as communism ended.
记者拉赫曼（Gideon Rachman）指出 ， “ 非西方经济体的崛起有深刻的历史变革根源，可以应对任何数量的经济和政治冲击 。 ”	The journalist Gideon Rachman has suggested that “the rise of non-Western economies is a deeply rooted historic shift that can survive any number of economic and political shocks.”
但玻利维亚宪法法院却裁定他可以参选，因为新通过的宪法将玻利维亚改名为多民族玻��维亚国；因此莫拉莱斯之前担任的是另一个国家的元首。	But Bolivia’s constitutional court has ruled that he can, because the adoption of a new constitution redefined the country as the Plurinational State of Bolivia; Morales, therefore, served his first term as the head of a different state.
拥有20万会员的“工会联盟”已经加入了反对派阵营。 Siniora的提案会进一步激发基层民粹主义者的民族主义情绪。	Already the 200,000-member Federation of Labour Unions has joined the opposition bandwagon, and Siniora’s proposals will further fuel grassroots populist nationalism.
席勒认为，新的“叙事经济学”应当研究流行叙事的传播和动态 . . . — —特别是那些涉及人类利益或情感的流行叙事 — — 以及这些变化如何随时间推移来理解经济波动 。 ”	A new “narrative economics,” Schiller maintains, should study “the spread and dynamics of popular narratives... – particularly those of human interest or emotion – and how these change through time, to understand economic fluctuations.”
这些温和的阿拉伯领导人几十年来一直利用对巴勒斯坦人事业的关注增强对其自身软弱无力及不民主的政权的民众支持，现在由于伊朗谋求霸权他们处于守势。	After decades of using concern for the Palestinian cause to shore up popular support for their own ineffective and undemocratic regimes, these moderate Arab leaders have now been put on the defensive by Iran’s quest for hegemony.
这些会议绝非日常事务，而是关于领导层如何看待中国全球地位的最清晰表达，同时也向世界传达了许多关于中国的信息。	These meetings are not everyday affairs. They are the clearest expression of how the leadership sees China’s place in the world, but they tell the world much about China as well.
日本成为世界排名第二的工业强国，而且几乎所有日本国民都享受到超出其父辈想象的社会保障水平和生活方式。	Japan became the world’s second-ranking industrial power, and almost all Japanese enjoyed lifestyles and levels of social security that their parents could never have imagined.
但由于所有的国家都不可能自行其是，也不会拒绝保持政治控制，我们就必须把欧盟的政策与各成员国的政策很好地结合起来。	But as the states won’t be able to do everything alone and won’t renounce maintaining political control, we must be able to link the Union’s policies and those of specific states.
但是至少在两年的时间里，穆沙拉夫想要兼得鱼和熊掌。 他一方面按照美国的要求在与阿富汗接壤的西部边境上打击伊斯兰分子，另一方面则在与印度接壤的东部边境上扶植他们。	For at least two years, though, Musharraf tried to have it both ways, cracking down at America’s behest on the Islamists on Pakistan’s western border with Afghanistan while sponsoring them on the eastern border with India.
迎接挑战需要克服海洋保护领域最棘手的障碍之一：在不归属单一国家管辖的约60%的世界公海海面上确保生物多样性可以持续。	Meeting it will require overcoming one of the most intractable obstacles to marine conservation: ensuring the sustainability of biodiversity in the roughly 60% of the world’s oceans that lie beyond the jurisdiction of individual states.
比如，诺华制药的新疆自治区“健康快车”便是由诺华公司和当地政府合作的旨在扩大药品覆盖面、建立医护能力、以及教育公众的项目。	For example, Novartis’s Jiankang Kuaiche (“Health Express”) program in Xinjiang is a partnership between Novartis and the local government that aims to expand access to medicine, build capacity, and educate the public.
里根时代的国务卿乔治·舒尔茨曾把他的角色比作园丁 — — “不断地培育复杂的行动者、利益和目标的复杂综合体 ” 。	Former Secretary of State George Shultz, who served under Ronald Reagan, once compared his role to gardening –“the constant nurturing of a complex array of actors, interests, and goals.”
专家不用面对诘难，他们往往使用模糊的字眼，比如“失业将保持高企多年”或“特朗普的支持率将大跌 ” 。	Left unchallenged, pundits routinely use vague language, such as “unemployment will remain high for years” or “Trump’s support will slide.”
长期以来，经济学假定关于我们偏好的信息都是外生于所要研究的问题的：即乔治·施蒂格勒（George Stigler）和加里·贝克尔（Gary Becker）所提出的“青菜萝卜，各有所爱 ” （ de gustibus non est disputandum ） 。	Economics has long assumed that whatever informs our preferences is exogenous to the issue at hand: de gustibus non est disputandum, as George Stigler and Gary Becker argued.
目前大部分相关研发都在美国，欧洲和中国进行，但大部分代码都是开源的，这意味着这项工作可能在任何地方完成。	Currently, the bulk of AGI R&D is carried out in the United States, Europe, and China, but much of the code is open source, meaning that the work potentially can be done from anywhere.
纽黑文—1998年9月，在亚洲金融危机最危险的时候，时任美联储主席格林斯潘的立场很简单：在步履蹒跚的世界中，美国无法成为繁荣的绿洲。	NEW HAVEN – In September 1998, during the depths of the Asian financial crisis, Alan Greenspan, the United States Federal Reserve’s chairman at the time, had a simple message: the US is not an oasis of prosperity in an otherwise struggling world.
而英国失业率为4.2 ％ — —与英国央行眼中的充分就业水平一致 — — 因此招聘人手就意味着要支付更高的工资。	With UK unemployment at 4.2% – a level consistent with full employment in the BoE’s view – hiring workers will mean higher wages.
仅仅在五年前，当来自前社会主义阵营的新兴民主国家加入欧盟时，人们对此还怀有很强烈的感情，并抱有很大的期望。	Emotions and expectations ran high when the new democracies from the former East Bloc joined the EU only five years ago.
经济学家所宣扬的最合理的方案 — — 如全球温室气体排放限额和相关的交易制度，或通过全球二氧化碳排放税执行世界范围内的碳定价 — — 得不到多少支持。	There is not much support for the most desirable solutions advocated by economists, such as a global cap on greenhouse-gas emissions, coupled with a trading system, or the enforcement of a worldwide carbon price through a global tax on CO2 emissions.
该项目包括九个大型工业区、高速货运路线、三个港口、六个机场、六车道高速公路和一个400万千瓦的电站。	The project includes nine large industrial zones, high-speed freight lines, three ports, six airports, a six-lane expressway, and a 4,000-megawatt power plant.
实际上，一旦地位得以巩固，垄断者就可以借用市场的力量来压制竞争者，就像微软公司在网景浏览器一案中所充分表现的那样。	Indeed, once established, a monopoly can use its market power to squelch competitors, as Microsoft so amply demonstrated in the case of the Netscape Web browser.
而当老布什组织多国联合控诉海湾战争时，他把一些阿拉伯国家也包括了进来 — — 这不是为了确保军事胜利，而是为了增加行动的合法性。	And, when Bush organized his international coalition to prosecute the Gulf War, he included several Arab countries – not to ensure military success, but to boost the mission’s legitimacy.
伊斯兰国不久后失去了对所有这些水坝的控制，但却在失控前成功地利用它们来淹没或者饿死下游人口，迫使他们投降。	ISIS subsequently lost control of all of them, but not before using them to flood or starve downstream populations, to pressure them to surrender.
最新的卢旺达会议由下一个爱因斯坦论坛（Next Einstein Forum）组织，总统卡加姆主持，旨在帮助该日程重回正轨。	The recent meeting in Rwanda, hosted by President Paul Kagame and organized by the Next Einstein Forum, was designed to help get the agenda back on track.
尽管神经科学家长于研究疼痛，但动物模型无法解释其中的“情感动机”要素，即疼痛的情感、感知和情景特征。	Although neuroscientists are adept at studying pain, animal models fail to account for its “affective-motivational” component – that is, pain’s emotional, cognitive, and contextual features.
土耳其的成功反映出数十年投资和可以追溯到奥斯曼帝国时代的数百年历史，并深深扎根于政府及普通民众所拥有的技能。	Turkey’s successes have deep roots in governmental capacity and its people’s skills, reflecting decades of investment and centuries of history dating back to Ottoman times.
具有讽刺意味的是，南欧各国原本欢迎欧元的主要原因在很大程度上是在1980~90年代，普通民众渴望能享有德国马克那样的的价格稳定。	Ironically, by far the main reason why euro adoption was originally so popular in Southern Europe was that back in the 1980s and 1990s, ordinary people longed for the price stability Germans enjoyed with their Deutsche Mark.
克林顿不需要与同僚辩论，相反，她需要确保六方框架中的其他国家，特别是中国和南朝鲜，和美国保持一致的步调。	Rather than debate with her counterparts, Clinton needs to ensure that other countries in the six-party framework, especially China and South Korea, are on the same page as the US.
此外，在一些国家 — — 比如英国 — — 工资下降和弹性劳动法规鼓励企业用劳动力代替资本，从而降低了员工人均产出。	Moreover, in some cases – for example, the United Kingdom – wage decreases and flexible layoff rules have encouraged firms to substitute labor for capital, reducing output per employee.
但是与贝布托达成的让她担任总理的协议会削弱军队的影响力，从而也会最终削弱它对穆沙拉夫担任总统的支持。	But a deal that makes Bhutto prime minister would undermine the military’s influence – and eventually its support for Musharraf’s presidency. As prime minister, she could eventually revisit her deal with Musharraf from a position of strength.
现实是，发的发世界央行在全球金融危机期间和之后保持物价稳定和货币购买力方面取得了成功 — — 而且是不折不扣的了不起的成功。	The reality is that central banks in the developed world have – in a truly fascinating way – succeeded in maintaining price stability and the purchasing power of money during and after the global financial crisis.
如今，标普500指数可以产生7%的年收益，因此理应无人问津美国政府的30年经通胀调整的债券 — — 收益率只有每年1 % 。	In a world in which the S&P 500 has a 7% annual earnings yield, nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1% per year.
为了描述新兴的社会技术模式（包括学科合并以及人类生活与上述领域进步的融合 ） ， 将当今时代称之为“混合时代”最恰如其分。	In order to describe emerging socio-technological patterns – including the merging of scientific disciplines and the fusion of human life with progress in these fields – the current era should be called the “Hybrid Age.”
换句话说，从越南的统计口径看，美国仍是其第一大出口市场，领先中国17 % ， 且这一差距在2018年前三个月保持稳定。	In other words, by Vietnam’s count, the US remained its largest export market by a margin of 17%, a gap that held steady during the first three months of 2018.
由于生产技术先进，内部整合迅速，净生产率高，这些国家的城市发展迅猛，急剧膨胀，而今许多城市都已达到空前规模，经济发展“气喘吁吁 ” 。	Because the growth of these cities has been accelerated and magnified by productive technologies, rapid internal migration, and high net reproduction rates, many have reached unprecedented sizes at breathless speed.
上个月，纳勒斯在社会民主党内部发起了一场辩论，她宣称德国“不能接收所有人 ” ， 这似乎是对右翼言论的一种呼应。	Last month, Nahles launched the debate within the SPD when, seemingly echoing right-wing rhetoric, she declared that Germany “cannot accept all.”
“经济爱国主义”是法国总理多米尼克·德维尔潘（Dominique de Villepin）在2005年7月百事公司传闻收购达能集团后创造出来的口号，也可能是对上述政治责任的最佳概括。	“Economic patriotism,” the slogan coined by France’s Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin following PepsiCo’s rumored attempt in July 2005 to takeover Danone, perhaps best encapsulates the political imperative.
显然，抱怨世界贸易组织或贸易协定的人是可怕的保护主义者，而那些支持世贸组织和贸易协定的人永远是天使。	Apparently, those who complain about World Trade Organization rules or trade agreements are awful protectionists, while those who support them are always on the side of the angels.
这种类型的转基因目前在英国尚不合法，尽管“肉体”基因组编辑 — — 实施于个体患者的不可遗传基因 — — 是允许的。	This type of gene modification is not currently legal in the UK, although “somatic” genome editing – performed on the non-heritable genes of individual patients – is permitted.
在2012年，两国间贸易额达到近20亿美元 — — 仅为韩国总贸易量的2 % ， 但相当于朝鲜方面的29 % 。	In 2012, inter-Korean trade amounted to $2 billion – only 0.2% of South Korea’s total trade, but 29% of North Korea’s.
这种状况如果长期得不到改善，后果就会越来越明显，因此，考虑到我们的渔业治理现状，只有很少数的鱼类个体能够长大，长成。	Mortality acts cumulatively, so, given the way we manage fisheries, few individuals survive to become big and old. Yet left to their own devices, cod are thought to live for at least thirty years.
即使德国仍然滞后于全球经济，如此增长的投资需求将会为GDP增长作出贡献。 Ifo估计，德国2006年的GDP增长率为1.7 % 。	Even if Germany remains the world’s laggard, rising investment demand as such will contribute to GDP growth, which Ifo estimates at 1.7% in 2006.
这一方面是因为2008年秋天20国集团和国际货币基金组织基金共同发出了实施���务融资型财政刺激政策的绝望呼吁。	This was partly because, in the fall of 2008, the G20 and the Fund issued desperate appeals for debt-financed fiscal stimulus.
“毫无疑问，存在一种非常重要但无组织的知识，从知识的一般规则来看，它们绝对称不上科学。 这就是关于特定环境和场合的知识。	“[T]here is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of particular circumstances and place.
我们需要新的、更为全面系统地分析工具来了解这些长期效果，同时还要有足够的培训来确保新的方法能够恰当地运用到实际中。	New and more sophisticated analytical tools are needed to understand these long-term effects, along with sufficient training to ensure that new methods are applied properly in the field.
在委内瑞拉，10月7日的总统大选可能会宣告查韦斯14年统治结束，与之一起结束的是对经济的系统性破坏、媒体管制和无穷无尽的干涉他国内政。	In Venezuela, the October 7 presidential election may put an end to Hugo Chávez’s 14 years in power, along with his systematic destruction of the economy, media clampdowns, and endless meddling in other countries’ affairs.
旧的观念是，大公司要负责从摇篮到坟墓的员工福利，不仅要发工资和奖金，还要提供运动设施、廉价的休假和慷慨的退休补助。	The old notion that large companies are responsible for their employees' welfare from cradle to grave - providing not only wages and bonuses, but sports facilities, cheap holidays, and generous retirement benefits - fell into desuetude.
美国对脱欧的英国的特殊关照 — — 特朗普反常地自称为“英国脱欧先生 ” — —确实表明了这两个采取各自经济民族主义的国家之间的团结。	A special US tenderness for Brexit Britain – Trump oddly referred to himself as “Mr. Brexit” – rather suggests the solidarity of two countries embarking on their own forms of economic nationalism.
匈牙利方面则刚刚通过了所谓的阻止索罗斯法，该法规定个人或非政府组织协助非法移民寻求避难的任何努力皆为非法。	Hungary, for its part, has just adopted the so-called Stop Soros Law, which criminalizes any effort by an individual or NGO to help an illegal immigrant claim asylum.
攻击移民或少数群体 — — 不管是通过言语赤裸裸地攻击还是通过政策更加巧妙地攻击 — — 在无论什么地方都是不可接受的。	Attacking migrants or minorities – whether crudely, through language, or more subtly, through policy – is unacceptable everywhere, full stop.
到目前为止，解决冲突的工作一直局限在奥斯陆框架的范围内，该协议规定巴勒斯坦民众的自决之路重要性大于就边界问题、定居点和返回权等问题达成协议。	Until now, efforts to resolve the conflict have been confined to the contours of the Oslo model, according to which the route to Palestinian self-determination traverses bilateral agreement on borders, settlements, territory, and the right of return.
因为它忽视了一种可能性，比如英国议员们可以利用在自己日常工作中所获取的信息进行股票交易，因为他们显然不符合“内幕交易者”的定义。	For example, it creates the possibility that, say, British MPs could legally trade shares on information acquired in the course of normal business, because they do not qualify as “insiders.”
发自维也纳 — — 团结是民主社会所必须具备的元素；如果失去了团结，整个社会就会陷入分裂，倘若社会成员之间彼此猜忌，有些成员又觉得被其他人所抛弃，那么在情况恶化到一定程度后，整个社会就会陷入瘫痪了。	VIENNA – Solidarity is essential to democratic societies; otherwise, they fall apart. They cannot function beyond a certain level of mutual distrust or a sense on the part of some members that other members have abandoned them.
尽管关于皮克提著作的争论大多集中在发达经济体，但这一基本概念同样适用于近年来中国的经验，因此值得我们进一步深入探讨。	While debate about Piketty’s work has focused largely on the advanced economies, this fundamental concept fits China’s recent experience, and thus merits closer examination.
但是，一些科学家（还有经济学家）根据地表温度推断的也反映了自然气候变化，因此不能通过减少二氧化碳排放遏制。	But some of the threats that scientists (and economists) deduce from the surface temperature also reflect natural climate change, and thus cannot be mitigated through the reduction of CO2 emissions.
纳伊夫亲王在公共演讲中禁止使用“改革”一词，因为这个词暗示了体系中的问题；他更喜欢的词语是“发展 ” 。	Prince Naif bans the very word “reform” from public discourse, because it suggests that there is something wrong with the system; his preferred term is “development.”
同样，如果改革纲要承诺发挥市场的“决定性作用 ” ， 最终提高中国贫困人口的工资，国内需求可能增加，但中国将在国际市场上失去其主要的竞争优势。	Likewise, if the reform outline’s promise of a “decisive role” for the market ends up raising wages for poor Chinese, domestic demand might increase, but China will lose its main competitive advantage in international markets.
类似地，公路智能交通系统可以让资产利用率提高一倍或两倍 — — 其成本往往是增加同等实体运能的几分之一。	Similarly, intelligent transportation systems for roads can double or triple the use of an asset – typically at a fraction of the cost of adding the equivalent in physical capacity.
但这不足以拯救政府在6月邦选举中的命运，在选举中上台的共产党政府支持酒精是魔鬼的教育，而不实施禁酒令，承诺重新评估禁酒政策。	But that was not enough to save the government in June’s state election, which produced a new communist administration that, advocating education about the evils of alcohol instead of a ban, has promised to review the prohibition policy.
对文化绝望的政治经历了自杀式的疯狂和血腥的失败，随后诞生了经济奇迹，德国也成了世界上最繁荣的国家之一，近60年来德国的民主制度也日益巩固。	The murderous triumph and bloody defeat of the politics of cultural despair was followed by an economic miracle that made Germany one of the world’s most prosperous countries, with nearly six decades of increasingly stable democracy.
但是，在达沃斯世界论坛演讲时，他没有把握这一机会，而是说了些中东地区各国政府应该倾听人民的声音、为年轻提供“工作和希望”之类的陈词滥调。	But, addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, he squandered it, sticking to platitudes about the need for governments in the region to listen to their citizens and provide young people with “jobs and hope.”
数以百计的地方儿童解放组织 — — 其中不少位于最偏远顽固的地区 — — 开始为儿童的公民权利斗争。	Hundreds of local child-liberation groups, some in the least promising of places, have emerged to fight for children’s civil rights.
在此期间，纽约人遭遇了飓风桑迪（Hurricane Sandy ） ， 台风海燕（Typhoon Haiyan）摧毁了菲律宾。	In the interim, New Yorkers faced Hurricane Sandy, while Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines.
因此，真正重要的是二氧化碳随时间排放量的累计值 — — 这一事实可见于政府间气候变化委员会（Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change）最新的第五版评估报告。	In this context, what really matters is the cumulative amount of CO2 being released over time – a fact that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recognized in its recently released Fifth Assessment Report.
也许有一天，我们会发现我们并不是宇宙中唯一存在的智能生物。 或许我们会讨论和这些不同物种之间的关系问题。	Perhaps one day we will find that we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe, and perhaps we will be able to discuss issues of interspecies ethics with such beings.
特朗普任命加里·科恩（Gary Cohn）为国家经济委员会（National Economic Council）主任，任命史蒂文·努钦（Steven Mnuchin）为财政部长。	Trump appointed Gary Cohn as Director of the National Economic Council and made Steven Mnuchin his Treasury Secretary.
20世纪90年代，我奔走反对希腊加入欧盟，一如英国工党领袖杰瑞米·科尔宾在20世纪70年代奔走反对加入欧盟。	Back in the 1990s, I campaigned against Greece’s entry into the eurozone, just like Britain’s Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, campaigned in the 1970s against joining the EU.
最能说明问题的迹象便是2010—2016年间担任财政大臣的乔治·奥斯本（George Osborne）无法实现任何预算目标。	The most telling indicator was the inability of George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016, to achieve any of his budget targets.
世界可持续发展商业委员会和全球消费品论坛等机构正在联合主要企业向政府施压，要求他们加入到探索可持续资本主义的行列中去。	Bodies like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the global Consumer Goods Forum are uniting key industry players and putting pressure on governments to join forces in the search for sustainable capitalism.
俄罗斯官方观点着眼于“EEU和丝绸之路经济带互相渗透、互相融合 ” ， 形成一个“大欧亚 ” ， 为“俄罗斯和中国提供稳定发展的安全的共同周边环境 。 ”	Official Russian opinion looks forward to “the interpenetration and integration of the EEU and the Silk Road Economic Belt” into a “Greater Eurasia,” which will afford a “steady developing safe common neighborhood of Russia and China.”
凯恩斯主义经济学的共同发明者之一波兰经济学家米哈尔·卡莱茨基（Michal Kalecki，也是我的一个远房亲戚）在1943年时就以惊人的准确性预测了这一政治推动的意识形态反转：	The Polish economist Michal Kalecki, a co-inventor of Keynesian economics (and a distant relative of mine), predicted this politically motivated ideological reversal with uncanny accuracy back in 1943:
我当时为一家大型美国银行工作，对当时频繁参加跨大西洋电话会议讨论意大利的债务与GDP比率的情景依然记忆犹新。	I was working for a very large American bank at the time, and I can still remember joining frequent transatlantic conference calls to discuss Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio.
英国脱欧公投的最初内容并未提及欧盟关税同盟和单一市场，也没有提及欧洲法院，但梅却宣布英国必须脱离这三个体系的管辖。	The language of the Brexit referendum did not include any mention of the EU customs union and single market, or of the European Court of Justice. But May announced that Britain must leave the jurisdiction of all three.
这一概念的逻辑很简单：如果我们想要让日益增加的人口变得更加健康，而不顾我们的自然资源的健康和安全，那么我们将举步维艰，甚至已经取得的进步也有可能遭到逆转。	The concept’s logic is simple: if we try to deliver better health to a growing population, without regard for the health and security of our natural resources, we will not just struggle to make new strides; we will reverse the progress already made.
与此同时，Uber等打车应用和Airbnb等民宿平台正在向人们表明城市如何成为科技发展最肥沃的土壤。	Meanwhile, vehicle-hailing apps like Uber and apartment-sharing platforms like Airbnb are demonstrating how cities have become some of the most fertile environments for technological development.
选民们将如何解释注定要浮出水面的该死真相，现在科米的前任罗伯特·米勒已经被任命为调查俄罗斯和特朗普竞选活动联系的特别顾问。	What will voters make of the damning revelations that are sure to come to light, now that Comey’s predecessor, Robert Mueller, has been appointed as special counsel to investigate the ties between Russia and Trump’s election campaign?
特朗普极尽奉承之事的 外国领导人莫过于中国国家主席习近平。 特朗普说习近平是“完人 ” 、 “了不起的绅士 ” 。	Trump has not flattered any foreign leader more than Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he called “terrific” and “a great gentleman.”
另外一种方法通过计算相对于战前的死亡率变化来估算战争所造成的总的死亡率变化（包括因战争原因直接或间接造成的死亡 ） 。	Another approach estimates the total change in mortality that the war caused (including deaths due to the war’s direct and indirect effects) by calculating the change in the death rate from the pre-war period.
确保城市宜居、环境可持续需要政府花大力气提供充足的公共交通、公共学校、公共医院、公园和有效的区划以及其他公共品。	Ensuring that cities are livable and environmentally sustainable will require strong government action to provide sufficient public transport, public schools, public hospitals, parks, and effective zoning, among other public goods.
此外，美国使用的大部分医疗IT系统主要用于协助提高缴费效率，而不是提高看护效率，将医院和诊所的商业利益置于医生和病患的需要之上。	Moreover, most health IT systems in use in America today are designed primarily to facilitate efficient billing, rather than efficient care, putting the business interests of hospitals and clinics ahead of the needs of doctors and patients.
但大部分印度人认为BJP施压EC尽可能推迟选举，以便其通过最后的赠品吸引选民 — — 这与抗洪救灾完全没有关系。	But most Indians believe that the BJP pressured the EC to delay the announcement as long as possible, so that it could attract voters with last-minute giveaways that had nothing to do with flood relief.
新的改革“领导小组”正在边缘化发改委，而中国最高级财政和货币决策者 — — 楼继伟和周小川 — — 快要卖出市场经济长征的最后一步了。	A new “leading committee” on reforms is marginalizing the NDRC, and China’s most senior fiscal and monetary policymakers – Lou Jiwei and Zhou Xiaochuan – are close to taking the final step in the long journey to a market-based economy.
主要问题不是IMF无法提供资金，而是它重蹈在希腊身上犯过的错误，没有让债务国和债权人达成现实的协议。	The main concern is not that the IMF will fail to deliver funds, but that it will make the same mistake it did in Greece, by not imposing a realistic deal on debtors and creditors.
美联储警告说，它可能提高联邦基金利率，如果预期年度通货膨胀率从目前的略低于2%升高到2.5%以上的话。	The Fed warns that it might increase the federal funds rate if the anticipated annual inflation rate rises from its current level of a bit less than 2% to more than 2.5%.
正是民粹主义的这种特点 — — 相信民众只有一种愿望，且只有唯一的真正代表可以实现他们这个愿望 — — 能够解释民粹主义和技术官僚政府间（常被提起，但却鲜有说明）的近似之处。	It is this feature of populism – the idea that the people want only one thing, and that only true representatives can give it to them – that explains a symmetry (often evoked, but seldom spelled out) between populism and technocratic government.
他受到这个思想的迷惑 — — 如他的保守派同志米尔顿·西美尔法布（Milton Himmelfarb）的名言 — — “犹太人赚钱的时候像是圣公会教徒，投票的时候像是波多黎各人 。 ”	He was baffled by the idea that, as his fellow conservative Milton Himmelfarb famously quipped, “Jews earn like Episcopalians and vote like Puerto Ricans.”
原有服务经济在路易十四宫廷时期达到顶峰，当时有专门的臣子满足太阳王包括最隐私需要在内的所有需求（有���门的仆人服侍国王如厕 ） 。	The zenith of the old service economy was the court of Louis XIV, where specialist courtiers attended to the Sun King’s every need, even the most intimate (there was a Groom of the King’s Close Stool).
但节俭的德国储户 — — 家庭、银行和保险公司 — — 对欧洲央行从他们（以及其他欧元区核心国）身上征税补贴欧元区外围饱受诘难的不知节制的花钱大户和借款人十分愤怒。	But Germany’s thrifty savers – households, banks, and insurance companies – are furious about ECB policies that tax them (and others in the eurozone core) to subsidize the eurozone periphery’s alleged reckless spenders and debtors.
卢萨卡 — — 当非洲领导人在定于2018年3月21日召开的卢旺达基加利首脑会议上发起成立大规模大陆自由贸易区（CFTA）时，避免推出某种空洞或冗余的条款应当是他们的首要任务。	LUSAKA – When African leaders launch the massive Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) on March 21, 2018, at a summit in Kigali, Rwanda, their top priority should be to avoid rolling out something that is either hollow or redundant.
但奥巴马医保能否成功的最大威胁在于大量没有从雇主处获得保险的个人将选择不为自己保险，而选择支付占收入1%的罚金（2015年后将永久提高到2.5 % ） 。	But the biggest danger to Obamacare’s survival is that many individuals who do not receive insurance from their employer will choose not to insure themselves and will instead pay the fine of just 1% of income (rising permanently after 2015 to 2.5%).
比如，在韩国的西式饭店，你会看到厕所贴着使用说明 — — 坐在抽水马桶上，而不是像使用传统韩国厕所那样蹲着。	For example, at my Western hotel in South Korea there was a pictogram alongside the toilet explaining how to use it properly – that is, to sit on the seat, rather than crouching over the bowl, as one would on a traditional South Korean toilet.
美国记者霍华德·弗兰奇描绘了非洲如何成为“中国的第二大陆 ” ， 因为超过100万新来的中国移民正在改造撒哈拉以南非洲。	The American journalist Howard W. French describes how Africa has become “China’s second continent,” as more than a million new Chinese settlers remake Sub-Saharan Africa.
预计非洲大陆的年轻人口到2050年将增加一倍至8.4亿，而非洲的学校和大学并没有培养出足够数量的能在明天工作岗位上取得成功的掌握技能技术的毕业生。	The continent’s youth population is projected to double by 2050, to 840 million, and yet Africa’s schools and universities are not producing enough graduates with the technical skills to succeed in the workplace of tomorrow.
圣保罗州州长、中间道路的巴西社会民主党候选人杰拉尔多·奥尔克明（Geraldo Alckmin）亦然。	So is Geraldo Alckmin, the São Paulo governor and candidate of the centrist Brazilian Social Democratic Party.
除非公司管理层与董事会之间存在利益冲突，否则如果经理做出错误、愚蠢的经营或战略决策，或者伤害到股东利益的时候，普通法国家的所有者可谓求诉无门。	Unless there is a conflict of interest between a company's management and its board, owners in common-law countries have no legal recourse when managers' operational or strategic decisions are bad, stupid, or otherwise harmful to shareholders.
挑战不在于再次试图“重启”双边关系，而是（在乌克兰危机消弭后）找到一个基础，让双方可以在利益重叠之处合作。	The challenge is not to try again to “reset” bilateral relations, but rather to find – once the Ukrainian crisis abates – a basis on which the two sides can collaborate where their interests overlap.
新的世贸组织贸易便利协定（WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement）将提升发展中国家的贸易能力、增强世贸组织的发展号召力、刺激全球经济增长，从而让所有人受益。	A new WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement would benefit all by increasing developing countries’ capacity to trade, strengthening the WTO’s development mandate, and boosting global economic growth.
其二，运转良好的金融-保险系统将大规模、低流动性的投资项目与相对较小、由看重流动性的个人储蓄者提供的资金组成的资金池匹配了起来。	Second, well-functioning financial systems match large, illiquid investment projects with the relatively small pools of money contributed by individual savers who value liquidity highly.
另一个关键性周期指标是制造业和服务业月度采购经理人指数（PMI）调查，包括存货和销售的基础次级指数。	Another key cyclical indicator is reflected in monthly Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) surveys for manufacturing and services, which include underlying sub-indices for inventories and sales.
显然，能够为游客提供如此卓越的接待的城市理应高枕无忧，也许只有一个例外：如何最好地利用它的能力和企业家天赋。	Surely any city that can look after visitors so superbly should have nothing to worry about, except, perhaps, how best to use the proceeds of its competence and entrepreneurial genius.
毕竟，西蒙·波利瓦尔因为一次邻国新格拉纳达（也就是今天的哥伦比亚）组织和出资的一场1814年侵略战争而获得了委内瑞拉解放者的称号。	After all, Simón Bolívar gained the title of Liberator of Venezuela thanks to an 1814 invasion organized and financed by neighboring Nueva Granada (today’s Colombia).
几十年来，伊斯兰堡和喀布尔政府在剿灭这两个集团的据点方面收效甚微，他们能够自由穿行于巡防松弛的边界间。	Over the decades, the governments in Islamabad and Kabul have done little to remove the sanctuaries established by the two groups, whose members freely cross the poorly patrolled frontier.
直到第二次世界大战后 — — 当关税及贸易总协定（1995年由WTO成功签署）开始了多边贸易自由化进程 — — 斯穆特-霍利关税法案的破坏性遗留问题才被终结。	It was only after World War II – when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (succeeded in 1995 by the WTO) began the process of multilateral trade liberalization – that Smoot-Hawley’s destructive legacy was finally overcome.
如果谷物生产国和消费国精诚合作，阻止此类政府干预 — — 可以通过世界贸易组织来实现 — — 世界价格的波动性是可以降低的。	If producing and consuming countries in grain markets could cooperatively agree to refrain from such government intervention – probably by working through the World Trade Organization – world price volatility might be lower.
而到了80多年后的今天，一位美国总统又拾起了这一口号，准备采取与威尔逊所信奉的信念截然相反的外交立场。	But now, for the first time in more than 80 years, a US president has taken it up again, to promote a foreign-policy stance that directly controverts the doctrine Wilson embraced.
中情局广泛招募穆斯林民众（包括欧洲的穆斯林民众）组成圣战游击队，这是一支由多国组成的逊尼派战斗部队，目的是将苏联异教徒赶出阿富汗。	The CIA recruited widely from Muslim populations (including in Europe) to form the Mujahideen, a multinational Sunni fighting force mobilized to oust the Soviet infidel from Afghanistan.
特朗普能够将朝鲜重新打入支恐名单，而丝毫没有引起官僚混乱和国际反应，这表明了为何这个名单是美国可以随意支配的有用的制裁。	The fact that Trump can put North Korea back on the terrorism list with little bureaucratic fuss and virtually no international repercussions demonstrates why the list is a useful sanction for the US to have at its disposal.
诚然，一些人仍坚持认为如果美联储不尽快提高利率、控制货币供给，美国经济将步津巴布韦的后尘（津巴布韦通胀率在2008年底远远超过了25,000 % ） 。	True, some people still insist that if the Fed doesn’t urgently raise interest rates and rein in the money supply, the US economy will go the way of Zimbabwe (where inflation far exceeded 25,000% in late 2008).
两人都强调 ， “ 太复杂而管不了”和“太大而管不了”基本上是同义词，至少对今天的美国银行系统是如此。	Both of them emphasize that “too complex to manage” is almost synonymous with “too big to manage,” at least within the US banking system today.
但是九十年代出现了巴尔干危机，最终人们意识到只有美军才能阻止塞尔维亚总统米洛塞维奇对科索沃的种族清洗。	But then came the Balkans crises of the 1990s, culminating in the realization that only American military power could put a stop to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic’s ethnic cleansing of Kosovo.
但开放政治经济网络（Open Political Economy Network）的李-牧山浩石（Hosuk Lee-Makiyama）和菲利普·勒格雷因（Philippe Legrain）最近对其成果进行了严厉的批评。	But Hosuk Lee-Makiyama and Philippe Legrain of the Open Political Economy Network recently delivered a scathing assessment of the results.
但这也存在一些风险，例如剩下来的三分之一人口（大多数是一些小国家）的利益如何体现出来，特别是他们在全球经济架构中的位置如何得以保证。	But there is a risk that the interests of the remaining one-third of the world’s people (and the majority of the small countries) will not be adequately represented as the international architecture for managing the global economy evolves.
1914年7月，各国外交官试图找出一个解决方案，让哈布斯堡王朝加入跨国政策谈判 — — 恐怖袭击的必然结果。	In July 1914, diplomats were trying to devise a solution that would permit the Habsburg Empire to deal with the cross-border police investigation that was inevitable after a terrorist attack.
低油价也提供了一个减少补贴的理想契机，令到政府可以将这些资金用在基础服务以及协助脱贫的社会福利项目之上。	Low oil prices offer an ideal opening to reduce subsidies, thereby releasing funds that governments can spend on basic services and social-welfare programs that advance poverty reduction.
事实上在许多方面看来这一举动是合乎逻辑的，毕竟民意调查显示，梅的保守党在比其对手工党领先了近20个百分点。	In fact, in many ways, it was a logical move. After all, opinion polls put May’s Conservative Party some 20 percentage points ahead of the opposition Labour Party.
为了实现这一目标，他必须全面运用手中的工具，包括像他曾威胁的那样削减美国对埃及武装部队的大规模军事援助。	To achieve this, he would need to use all of the leverage at his disposal, including cutting off the massive military assistance that the US provides to Egypt’s armed forces, as he has threatened to do.
“好”好是税收改革势在必行，并且很可能由众议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）和他的团队执行 — — 为富人制定累进性较低、对资本较友好的税制，这是共和党长期追求的目标。	The “good” news is that tax reform was inevitable, and was likely to be undertaken by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and his staff – giving the rich the less progressive, more capital-friendly tax system that Republicans have long sought.
中国贸易顺差自2008年年末开始的下降主要来自于全球增长的放缓以及政府的经济刺激计划，而不是人民币汇率的变化。	The fall in China’s trade surplus since late 2008 is attributable mainly to the global slowdown and the stimulus package introduced by the Chinese government, rather than to changes in the RMB’s exchange rate.
但是，由于政治、社会和经济体制的地区差异 — — 这些差异通常体现在本土历史和文化的特殊性中 — — 市民行为及态度仍存在很大区别。	But, given regional differences in political, social, and economic arrangements – often reflecting the particularities of local history and culture – significant divergences in citizens’ attitudes remain.
但现在所实施的财政紧缩有一个马上产生的效果 — — 让人们失业，导致他们只能用被拒绝和被排斥的感觉填充他们的生活。	But the kind of fiscal austerity that is being practiced now has the immediate effect of rendering people jobless and filling their lives with nothing but a sense of rejection and exclusion.
但西班牙并没有坐视去殖民化进程，而是与摩洛哥和毛里塔尼亚签署了三方“马德里协议 ” ， 之后两国都派兵进驻吞并西撒哈拉。	And rather than allowing a process of decolonization, Spain signed the tripartite “Madrid Accords” with Morocco and Mauritania, both of which subsequently moved in to annex the territory.
经济学家的模型就是一种意识形态：它们简化世界、强调特定的因果关系并尽可能忽略其他，从而让我们能够了解谁正在对谁做什么。	Economists’ models are a kind of ideology: they simplify the world, emphasize certain causal links and minimize others, and allow us to get a sense of who is doing what to whom.
其实大多数人都能忍受相当程度的政治压迫，比如秘密警察，严刑拷打和贪污腐败，只要这个政府能提供安全和一点点的繁荣和公平就行了。	Most people, it seems, will tolerate a modest amount of political repression, including secret police, torture, and corruption, if it delivers security and a modicum of prosperity and fairness.
这就只能靠国务卿蒂勒森，国防部长詹姆斯·马蒂斯（James Mattis）和其他希望减轻所谓“怒火与打击”的好战言论（总统在某高尔夫球场俱乐部会所里随性发出的）的人们去消除这一影响。	This has called for assurances from Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and others eager to mitigate the impact of bellicose exclamations – incongruously issued off the cuff from the clubhouse of a golf course – about “fire and fury.”
但是公共投资与其他类型的政府支出（比如对公共部门工资和社会转移支付）不同，公共投资的作用是积累资产，而不是消耗他们。	But public investment is different from other types of official outlays, such as expenditures on public-sector wages or social transfers. Public investment serves to accumulate assets, rather than consume them.
与AIG的合约是衍生品合约，通过清算所交易；但与花旗银行的合约类型有所不同，比如属于常规贷款，因此并不经过清算所进行。	The contract with AIG is a derivatives contract, which goes through the clearinghouse; but the contract with Citibank is another kind of contract, maybe just a regular loan, and does not go through the clearinghouse.
事实上，在阿萨德政权倒台后，约旦可能成为下一个危机热点，关于约旦是“真正”巴勒斯坦国的争论将死灰复燃。	Indeed, after the Assad regime falls, Jordan could prove to be the next crisis hotspot, which might revive the debate over Jordan as the “real” Palestinian state.
同时因为这个孩子长大后难以找到一份好的工作，所以营养不良不仅仅左右了他或她的生活，也会波及到他们的下一代。	And because it is harder for that child to get a good job when he or she grows up, malnutrition shapes not just his or her life, but also the lives of the next generation.
没有哪个执政党能容忍如此无能的部长和领导；过去四年中，默克尔站在一旁冷眼目睹自由派在公众面前自寻死路。	No governing party can afford such woefully incompetent ministers and leadership; Merkel had merely to stand back and watch the liberals’ public suicide over the last four years.
离岸人民币枢纽在法兰克福、巴黎、米兰、卢森堡、布拉格和苏黎世纷纷涌现，大部分欧洲央行都将人民币加入（或考虑加入）其货币组合。	Offshore renminbi hubs have emerged in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, Luxemburg, Prague, and Zurich, and most of Europe’s central banks have added – or are considering adding – China’s currency to their portfolios.
美联储依然希望流动性和市场信心能够很快被恢复，而2007年的夏天可以为未来的经济学家树立金融市场可以怎样与真实经济中消费和生产的流动脱节的范例。	The Fed still hopes that liquidity and confidence can be restored quickly, and that the summer of 2007 will serve future economists as an example of how de-linked financial markets can be from the flows of spending and production in the real economy.
在有许多公司为给人们提供长期的、确定金额的退休养老金之时，政府建立一个平行的、确定金额的体制并且要求工人们参加就没有什么优势可言了。	When there are lots of companies offering workers long-term defined-benefit retirement pensions, there are fewer advantages to the government in setting up a parallel defined-benefit scheme and requiring workers to participate in it.
伊斯兰金融禁止收取利息、并要求投资用于实体经济，再加上其收益和损失分担的做法加大了金融行业的稳定度。	Its prohibition of interest and requirement that investments be linked to the real economy, together with its approach to profit- and loss-sharing, add stability to the financial sector.
这表明新的神经细胞不是通过已有的细胞的分裂产生的，而是在大脑的其他地方产生，然后迁徙过来的，而在迁徙过程中，它们并没有表现出是神经细胞。	This told us that the new neurons were not born by division of existing neurons, but were born elsewhere in the brain and went through a migratory stage during which they were not recognized as neurons.
近一半阿拉伯人需要仰仗来自非阿拉伯国家 — — 包括土耳其和尼罗河上游国家 — — 的淡水流入这一事实可能将进一步加剧水危机。	The fact that nearly half of all Arabs depend on freshwater inflows from non-Arab countries, including Turkey and the upstream states on the Nile River, may serve to exacerbate water insecurity further.
最重要的是，总理雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安和由副总理阿里·巴巴詹领导的经济团队一直坚持从基础做起，并秉承长远的眼光。	Most important, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his economics team, led by Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan, have stuck to basics and looked to the long term.
有一条分界线横亘在两种社会之间：容忍通过政治来实现自身富裕的社会，以及要求政治和财富相互分离的社会。	One dividing line is between societies that tolerate self-enrichment through politics, and those that demand that the two spheres be kept separate.
更广泛的中国学界一直是中共政权寻找敌人的首要目标 — — 大学常常开除信奉宪政等“煽动性”思想的教授。	Chinese academia more broadly has been the regime’s chief target in its search for enemies, with universities dismissing professors for espousing “seditious” ideas like constitutionalism.
但如果认为仅靠市场就可以管理其革命性影响是纯粹的荒唐事 — — 事实上，这一点在最近发生的植根于肆无忌惮金融创新的全球经济危机中已经得到了证实。	But to think that markets alone can manage its transformative impact is pure folly – a fact that the recent global economic crisis, which was rooted in unbridled financial innovation, made clear.
盟国在二战中的胜利和《大西洋宪章》所带来的是一项全球新政：通过同意遵守国际规则并借助国际机构行事，各国可以共享战后的繁荣。	What came of the Allies’ victory in World War II and the Atlantic Charter was a Global New Deal: by agreeing to play by international rules and institutions, countries could participate in the post-war bonanza.
加州的计划基于吉拉杜奇（Teresa Ghilarducci）及其同事的方案，将自动注��符合条件的员工（员工人数五人及以上的私人部门员工，雇主不提供退休计划 ） 。	The California plan, based on a proposal by Teresa Ghilarducci and her colleagues, would automatically enroll eligible employees, defined as private-sector workers at firms with five or more employees that do not offer retirement plans.
人们还说确立简单多数的表决原则也很重要。 清迈倡议的投票权大体同各成员经济体出资比例相当，这意味着没有任何一个国家能够阻挠共同行动。	Also significant, we are told, is the agreement to make decisions by simple majority, with countries’ votes to be roughly in proportion to their contributions.
欧盟的某些人 — — 主要在法国、德国和奥地利 — — 似乎对这个问题上可能发生的冲突幸灾乐祸，认为这样会促使土耳其放弃对加入欧盟的追求。	Some in the EU – mainly in France, Germany, and Austria – seem smugly pleased by the prospect of a clash on this issue, believing it will force Turkey to give up its drive for membership.
预期的调查结果预测，截至2050年，全球近90%的贫困人口将集中在撒哈拉以南非洲地区，而2/3的世界最贫困人口将集中生活在十个国家。	Among the expected findings is a prediction that by 2050, nearly 90% of global poverty will be concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, and two-thirds of the world’s poorest people will live in just ten countries.
崇尚鲜活社会主权的国家主义含蓄而又彻底地削弱了上帝的地位；即便与宗教融合并以宗教用语的形式出现，也无法改变其根本的世俗性质。	By considering a living community sovereign, nationalism implicitly but drastically reduced the relevance of God; even when combined with religion and presented in a religious idiom, it was essentially secular.
伟大的佛罗伦萨自由派政治家里卡索利（Bettino Ricasoli）认为托斯卡纳大区根本无法在财政上自立根生。	The great Florentine liberal statesman, Bettino Ricasoli, concluded that Tuscany was simply financially unviable on its own.
发自加利福尼亚克莱尔蒙特 — — 几乎所有国家（不管是民主还是专制政体）的统治精英都认为漂亮的口号能鼓舞民众并使其权力合法化。	CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Ruling elites almost everywhere – whether in democracies or in authoritarian regimes – believe that clever sloganeering can inspire their people and legitimize their power.
圭亚那将科纳克里机场精神渗透到了整个国家，作为商品资源丰富国家，圭亚那是少数逃脱了自然资源禀赋丰富国常见的腐败诅咒和经济衰退的国家之一。	By amplifying such exemplars into a national project, Guinea could join the small group of commodity-rich countries that have bucked the curse of corruption and economic decay that often accompanies large natural-resource endowments.
联合国秘书长潘基文在他的《尊严之路 》 （ The Path to Dignity）报告中呼吁我们采取行动，可持续发展之年已经开始。	With United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s call to action in his report “The Road to Dignity,” the Year of Sustainable Development has begun.
辅助和教唆小布什的是美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan ） ， 他怪异地认为盈余是一个威胁。	He was aided and abetted by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who bizarrely considered the surpluses a threat.
大部分西部片的故事是一曲开放的田园牧歌，人在其中找到完美的自主权，而威胁这个田园牧歌的则是由人造法律治理的国家。	The story of most Westerns is of a wide-open rural idyll, where man has found perfect autonomy, threatened by a state ruled by man-made laws.
为了遏制这一趋势，凯恩斯提出用调整的压力在债务人和债权人之间对称分担的体系取代“调整过程对债务人来说是义务，对债权人来说是志愿”的体系。	To counter this tendency, Keynes advocated replacing any system in which “the process of adjustment is compulsory for the debtor and voluntary for the creditor” with one in which the force of adjustment falls symmetrically upon debtors and creditors.
惟其如此，我们才能看清投资和创新对激励的反应有多大，免费全民教育的中期成本有多大，人口结构如何影响不同的社会政策。	Only then could we gauge how strongly investment and innovation would respond to incentives, how much free universal education would cost in the medium term, or how demographic structures would affect different social policies.
但成功需要在维持系统稳定和允许中国这个庞大经济体不断适应及成长之间保持平衡 — — 这正是中国几百年以来面临的巨大挑战。	But success will require striking a balance between maintaining systemic stability and allowing the country’s massive economy to adapt and grow – a challenge with which China has struggled for centuries.
这意味着实现现有福利结构所需的税率必须从目前的12％上升到2030年的18 ％ ， 其他主要国家也面临着类似的问题。	That implies that the tax rate needed to achieve the current benefit structure would have to rise from 12% today to 18% in 2030. Other major countries face a similar problem.
另一个更加中性的可能是市场之所以没有对不同种类的债券分别定价，是因为它们不理解计划会让一些债权人受损，而让另一些债权人安全。	Another more neutral possibility is that markets aren’t pricing the different types of debt differently because they do not understand that the plan involves hitting some creditors hard and keeping others safe.
但是，最有可能的是，2011年美国和欧洲的早已是众人皆知、且迄今为止治理大为不善的经济和政治问题将在2012年继续恶化。	The likelihood, though, is that the economic and political problems that were so manifest in the US and Europe in 2011 – and which have so far been tremendously mismanaged – will only grow worse in 2012.
梅德韦杰夫的看法佐证了他对俄国问题源于政治的理解 — — 执政党派的堕落、反对力量的缺失、以及缺乏对少数政治势力的尊���。	Medvedev’s assessment attested to his understanding that Russia’s problems are rooted in its politics – in the degradation of the ruling party, in the absence of a real opposition, and in the lack of respect for the rights of political minorities.
但利比亚标志着一个新概念的开端，这一新概念正适用于如今的马里，可以称之为“从上面跟随 ” （ following from above ） 。	Yet Libya marked the beginning of a concept – applicable to Mali today – that might be termed “following from above.”
在边境面对毒品、传染病和恐怖主义变得漏洞百出的世界里，美国必须协助成立国际联盟和机构，应对共同面临的挑战和威胁。	In a world where borders are more porous than ever to everything from drugs to infectious diseases to terrorism, America must help build international coalitions and institutions to address shared threats and challenges.
即便如此，基地组织首脑人物的陆续覆灭，美国情报部门的不断强化，更加严格的边境管制以及美国联邦调查局与中央情报局的更紧密合作也令美国（及其盟友）变得更加安全。	Even so, the elimination of top Al Qaeda leaders, the strengthening of American intelligence, tighter border controls, and greater cooperation between the FBI and the CIA have all clearly made the US (and its allies) safer.
这或许可以有助于说明为什么北京T3航站楼是如此的成功，也有助于解释为什么中国目前空前团结，同声谴责任何出于某种不可告人的目的而挟持或者玷污奥运的企图	This may help explain why T3 in Beijing is such a success, and why Chinese are now more united than ever before in condemning attempts to hijack or sully the Olympics for ulterior motives.
在最佳状态下，该协议将补充所谓的产品研发伙伴关系，而上述关系已经协助解决了包括结核病在内的许多被忽视的疾病。	In the best-case scenario, that agreement will supplement the so-called product development partnerships that have already helped tackle many neglected diseases, including TB.
继金担任英格兰银行行长的马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）说，在提供流动性贷款为大银行兜底方面 ， “ 我们采取开放态度 。 ”	Mark Carney, King’s successor at the BoE, said, “We are open for business,” in terms of providing liquidity loans to backstop big banks.
目前，联邦税占GDP之比为18.3 % ， 预计未来几十年内将维持在这一水平，除非税收规则或税率发生改变。	Federal taxes now take 18.3% of GDP and are projected to remain at that level for the next decade, unless tax rules or rates are changed.
2013年第二季度的首个正式GDP增长数字将于7月31日披露，有可能连1%都不到，这意味着今年上半年的年度GDP增长远低于2012年。	The first official estimate of GDP growth in the second quarter of 2013, to be released on July 31, is likely to be less than 1%, implying that annual GDP growth in the first half of this year was considerably slower than in 2012.
新总统的任期将从2013年1月开始，与目前奥巴马和罗姆尼竞争口号中所描述的情形相反，上台者将会发现没有多少空间可以用于调整经济政策。	By the time the next presidential term starts in January 2013, and contrary to the current narratives advanced by the Obama and Romney campaigns, the incumbent will find himself with limited room for maneuver on economic policy.
这是一个众所周知的现象；事实上，乔治·阿克罗夫（George Akerlof）因为对汽车“柠檬（在美国口语中意为次品 ） ” 市场的研究，获得了诺贝尔奖。	This is a well-known phenomenon; indeed the study of the market for automotive “lemons” won George Akerlof the Nobel Prize.
牛津—IMF总裁拉加德最近在论及尚未完成的全球金融部门改革日程时说 ： “ 首先，我们需要在太重要而不能倒难题上取得真正的进展。	OXFORD – Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, recently said of the unfinished agenda for global financial-sector reform: “To start, we need concrete progress with the too-important-to-fail conundrum.
这一问题通常乍看上去很不起眼，但却恰到好处地触及了我们实际上想知道的东西：抑制人们长期支出意愿的深层次焦虑和担心是什么。	That question is usually not singled out for attention, but it appears spot-on for what we really want to know: what deep anxieties and fears do people have that might inhibit their willingness to spend for a long time.
纳瓦兹·谢里夫（Nawaz Sharif）总理的新策略 — — 寻求与巴基斯坦塔利班达成互不干扰协议 — — 将可能导致更多的国内危机。	And Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s new strategy – to seek a non-interference agreement with the Pakistani Taliban – will probably lead to even more domestic insecurity.
事实上，去监管话要求他们把日本的长期利益置于他们自身的短期利益之前 — — 到目前为止，他们对此十分抵触。	Indeed, deregulation would require them to put their country’s long-term interests above their own short-term interests – a choice that they have so far resisted.
事实上，最近几个月来关于硅谷的最有说明性的事实是包括苹果、谷歌、Facebook和Twitter在内的大型科技公司的极端道德和性别失衡。	Indeed, one of the most revealing facts to come to light about Silicon Valley in recent months is the extreme ethnic and gender imbalance at large technology companies, including Apple, Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
蒂尔顿—1957年罗马条约（Treaty of Rome，最终形成欧盟的基本文件）的第一句话呼吁建立“一个欧洲各民族间更加紧密的联盟 ” 。	"TILTON – The first sentence of the 1957 Treaty of Rome – the founding document of what would eventually become the European Union – calls for “an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe."""
值得记住的是，在第二十世纪经历了两次世界大战之后，和平才是第一要务，其优先级与繁荣等同，甚至要高于繁荣。	It is worth remembering that in the twentieth century, following two world wars, peace was the top priority, along with – or even before – prosperity.
而且，虽然根本不发表讲话可能是最明智的对策，他仍然可以利用这个机会巩固日本作为亚洲积极力量的国家形象。	And, though not delivering a speech at all might have been the most prudent course, he can still use the occasion to reinforce an image of his country as a positive force in Asia.
在管理朝向多极的转变中，西方最大的挑战在亚洲 — — 这个地区既充满活力、面向未来，又深受历史恩怨和分裂纠缠。	In managing the transition toward multipolarity, the West’s greatest challenge lies in Asia – a region that is simultaneously dynamic and future-oriented and hampered by historical tensions and divides.
过紧的宏观经济政策，特别是房地产调控政策，将增加减速风险，目前，在政府严厉措施的作用下，全国房价都呈现出下降态势。	Over-tightening of domestic macroeconomic policies, especially those aimed at the real-estate market, could heighten the risk of a slowdown, with house prices currently falling across China, owing to stringent government measures.
但是，从数以千万计的工人中征收工资税并开具数以千万计张的养老金支票是政府所可以做得好的例行公事以及半自动化的任务。	But the collection of payroll taxes from tens of millions of workers and the writing of tens of millions of pension checks is the kind of routine, semi-automatic task that government can do well.
我们逃避了自己对后人的责任，也逃避了对如今生活在世界上其他地方为数众多的、正在承受我们的短视造成的后果的人们的责任。	We have sidestepped our duties both to our descendants and to the large number of people alive here and now in other parts of the world who are suffering the consequences of our myopia.
当前我们遇到的是中间派政治崩溃所产生的自然反应，而导致这一切的则是全球资本主义危机 — — 金融危机导致经济大萧条再到如今的大通缩。	What we are experiencing today is the natural repercussion of the implosion of centrist politics, owing to a crisis of global capitalism in which a financial crash led to a Great Recession and then to today’s Great Deflation.
事实上，特朗普政府发表的官方国家安全战略描绘了美国为维护全球秩序而作出的努力是如何产生反作用和自我挫败的。	Indeed, the Trump administration’s official National Security Strategy portrays US efforts to safeguard the global order as counterproductive and self-defeating.
并非所有人都同意这样的观点；与私营部门和非政府机构在教育领域的部分伙伴关系引发了相当大的争议，而且毫无疑问，利比里亚的桥梁模式仍处在推进的过程中。	Not everyone will agree; partial partnerships with the private sector and NGOs in education generates considerable controversy, and there is little doubt that in Liberia, the Bridge model remains a work in progress.
毛泽东主义是阶级斗争和社会主义性质的平均主义之间的一种奇特而独特的结合体，毛泽东将这些观念清楚的表达为，他认为每一个体 — — 或者至少是毛泽东本人 — — 能够塑造历史，而不是单单被历史的潮流与趋势所塑造。	Maoism was a curious and unique mixture of class warfare and socialist leveling, all enunciated by a man who believed that individuals – or at least Mao himself – could shape history rather than be formed by its tides and currents.
在没有全球治理机构和法律框架指导国际合作的情况下，多数国家不得不退而求其次，依赖于本国国内的移民流动单边管理。	Without global-governance institutions and legal frameworks to guide international cooperation, most countries must resort to unilateral management of their own migration flows.
为了解决气候变化和全球性不平等等迫切的全球问题，我们必须要重新思考主导经济模式，引入其他激励机制，借以改变人们的行为。	In order to address pressing global problems like climate change and inequality, the predominant economic models must be rethought, incorporating other motivational systems that can induce different human behaviors.
唐纳德·特朗普的竞选团队每天要对 40-50,000个广告选项进行评估，而后再根据评估状况定制、并针对性地发布相关的消息。	Donald Trump’s campaign was measuring responses to 40-50,000 variants of ads every day, then tailoring and targeting their messaging accordingly.
上世纪 90 年代，欧盟大力推行前所未有的财政规范 — — 通过伪造账目向希腊施以援手 — — 葡萄牙、意大利、希腊和西班牙（被戏称为 “ 欧猪四国 ” ） 于 2002 年借此成功加入了欧盟。 但是，各国此后便又再次肆无忌惮起来。	True, Germany ultimately acquiesced in a deal that would provide, if needed, a combination of bilateral loans from eurozone members and IMF financing to prevent a Greek default.
如果各国的财政部长仅仅坐在一起央求美联储主席伯南克和欧洲央行行长特里谢削减利率来拯救他们那真是太不幸了。	It would be unfortunate if the finance ministers merely sit around and beg Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank head Jean-Claude Trichet to rescue them with rate cuts.
普京说，他支持特朗普（但是当然了，他并没有干预选举令特朗普获益 ） ， 因为他们都渴望改善双边关系。	According to Putin, he rooted for Trump (but of course did not interfere on Trump’s behalf) because they shared a desire to improve bilateral relations.
但这一回，军队并未走出军营，原因很简单：觉醒的民众、活跃的公民社会和充满活力的自由媒体不会容忍政治再次落入军方之手。	But this time the soldiers have remained in their barracks, for the simple reason that an awakened populace, an active civil society, and a free and vibrant media would not tolerate another venture into politics by the army.
在中国崩溃情形中，这一出口需求将干涸 — — 大约会将2016年美国经济增长率拉低0.2—0.3个百分点，而美国经济原本已相当疲软，预计增长率只有1.6%左右。	In a China-implosion scenario, that export demand would all but dry up – knocking approximately 0.2-0.3 percentage points off already subpar US economic growth of around 1.6% in 2016.
如今，政变已经失败，他将拥有政治顺风实现他早有企图的宪法修订，强化总统权力，将权力都集中在自己手中。	Now that the coup has failed, he will have the political tailwind to make the constitutional changes he has long sought to strengthen the presidency and concentrate power in his own hands.
但独立的中央银行如果不准备直面市场、做出负责任的经济管理工作所要求的严守纪律的艰难抉择，还要它们做什么？	But what do independent central banks stand for if they are not prepared to face up to the markets and make the tough and disciplined choices that responsible economic stewardship demands?
据预计，在2015—2020年间，数字化在这些国家所创造的就业岗位要比它们所消灭的就业岗位多出160—230万个。	Digitization is expected to generate between 1.6 million and 2.3 million more jobs than it eliminates in these countries between 2015 and 2020.
危机国家希腊求助于亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯的极左翼激进联盟，同时之前占主导地位的新民主和泛希社运党联袂获得了不到三分之一的民众选票。	Among crisis countries, Greece turned to Alexis Tsipras’s far-left Syriza coalition, while the former dominant parties, New Democracy and Pasok, jointly gained less than one-third of the popular vote.
从诸多方面看，这一动作是非常积极的，但一个突出的原因是这将把全球农商（agribusiness）贸易中长期存在的利益冲突曝光于天下。	This move is welcome for many reasons, but especially because it will begin to expose the conflicts of interest that are endemic in the global agribusiness trade.
比如，捐赠誓言就是世界上最富有的一群人 — — 包括沃伦·巴菲特和比尔·盖茨在内 — — 把自身大部分财富用于慈善的承诺。	For example, the Giving Pledge is a commitment by some of the world’s richest people, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates among them, to devote the majority of their wealth to philanthropy.
2013年5月，伯南克释放出可能退出QE的信号，这又让新兴经济体面临相反的压力：资本外流和汇率急剧波动。	Since May 2013, when Bernanke signaled the possibility of unwinding QE, emerging economies have faced the opposite type of pressure: capital outflows and sharp currency adjustments.
最后，但同样重要的是，要想确保第四次工业革命转化为经济增长并惠及所有人，我们必须同心协力创造新的监管生态系统。	Last but not least, to ensure that the Fourth Industrial Revolution translates into economic growth and bears fruit for all, we must work together to create new regulatory ecosystems.
在访问拉合尔的前一天，他告诉阿富汗议会，他希望“巴基斯坦成为南亚和阿富汗之间的桥梁 ， ” 并讨论了该地区国家如何“实现共同繁荣 ” 。	The day before he visited Lahore, he told Afghanistan’s parliament that he hopes “Pakistan will become a bridge between South Asia and Afghanistan and beyond,” and discussed how the region’s countries “can all prosper together.”
全球经济的极限则是最近出现的，其源头是空前膨胀的世界人口，以及前所未见的，几乎遍布全世界的经济增长。	The limits to the global economy are new, resulting from the unprecedented size of the world’s population and the unprecedented spread of economic growth to nearly the entire world.
与会机构穆斯林公共事务委员会代表Riham Osman表示使用诸如“激进伊斯兰”这样的词汇有损于打击暴力的事业。	"Riham Osman, speaking on behalf of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which participated in the summit, said that using terms like “radical Islam"" harms the cause of stopping the violence."
加快和综合实施本文所述的三种干预手段能够极大地改善肺炎和腹泻的预防情况，特别是对最脆弱儿童而言，让他们能够过上健康的、富有创造力的生活。	But the accelerated and coordinated implementation of the three interventions described here could go a long way toward preventing pneumonia and diarrhea, especially for the most vulnerable children, enabling them to lead healthy, productive lives.
正如一位政治科学家安德鲁·海克最近所说的 ， “ 布什正是给了超过六千万的人们一个对他们自己感觉良好的机会，才得以多票当选 。 ”	As the political scientist Andrew Hacker recently put it, “the Bush candidacy was framed to make a majority by giving some 60 million people a chance to feel good about themselves.”
讽刺的是，在近几年中贯彻肯尼迪总统“不惜一切代价 ” 、 “战胜一切负担”捍卫自由的口号最力、并以此为荣的正是共和党。	Ironically, it is the Republicans who have prided themselves in recent years as the party that took up President John F. Kennedy’s call to “pay any price” and “bear any burden” in defense of liberty.
我们专注于无甚大用 — — 但成本高昂 — — 的绿色政策，这让我们感到好受，但忽略了甚至积极地抑制着能大量减排、经济上也划算的政策。	We are focusing on insignificant – but very costly – green policies that make us feel good, while ignoring or actively discouraging policies that would dramatically reduce emissions and make economic sense.
优惠融资可能有助于中国国有公司拿下巨额海外合同；但这也埋下了新的资产质量风险，从而加剧了中国银行系统所面临的挑战。	Concessionary financing may help China’s state-owned companies bag huge overseas contracts; but, by spawning new asset-quality risks, it also exacerbates the challenges faced by the Chinese banking system.
在哈梅内伊公开支持内贾德2009年充满争议的竞选连任时，没有人能够预料这两大权威将随后陷入史无前例的紧张关系。	When Khamenei publicly supported Ahmadinejad’s controversial reelection in 2009, no one could have predicted the unprecedented tensions that would subsequently emerge between the country’s two main authorities.
至此，上述这些考量都引出了一种具有可替代性的未来前景：能否催生一个拥有对内对外都更加温和的领导层的伊朗，一个放弃发展一切与核武有关事务的国家。	These considerations raise the prospect of trying to bring about an alternative future: an Iran with a political leadership that is more moderate at home and abroad, and that forgoes developing a nuclear weapon or anything close to it.
朝鲜领导人金正恩没有表现出任何谈判兴趣，甚至不愿意听到任何人对他不顾后果追求核武器和发射核武器用的远程导弹置喙。	North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has shown no interest in negotiation, or even in listening to what anyone has to say about his reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and the long-range missiles needed to deliver them.
就好像以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突的深度和持续时间还不够催生国际解决方案一样，这当中还夹杂着巴勒斯坦对美国根深蒂固的不信任。	As if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict’s depth and duration were not enough to merit an international solution, there is also the issue of Palestine’s mistrust of the US.
无论结果如何，特朗普都最好反躬自问他所取得的成果是否比被他形容为“有史以来最差交易”的与伊朗签署的全面联合行动计划更好。	Whatever the outcome, Trump would do well to ask himself if it is any better than the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, which he has described has “the worst deal ever.”
与伊斯兰国等组织进行合作令人不快，但同样重要的是要记住根除脊髓灰质炎运动这样的努力的目标是改善人们的健康，不管他们生活在何处。	As objectionable as working with groups like the Islamic State might be, it is important to remember that the main objective of efforts like the campaign to eradicate polio is to improve the health of people wherever they may live.
其次，我的同事苏菲（Amir Sufi）与合作者米安（Atif Mian）指出，在美国，家庭过度负债和需求下降都是本地化的。	Second, household over-indebtedness in the US, as well as the fall in demand, is localized, as my colleague Amir Sufi and his co-author, Atif Mian, have shown.
此时，央行必须出手干预，将流动性设定在合理的价格水平上 — — 使之成为中央计划和管理的价格 — — 而不是任由它根据私有部门的供求而自由涨落。	At such a time, central banks must step in and set the price of liquidity at a reasonable level – make it a centrally-planned and administered price – rather than let it swing free in response to private-sector supply and demand.
布鲁塞尔的精英们不大可能不再骚扰就承认这一事实。 他们的高谈阔论依旧在极度悲观主义和某种亲欧洲的公共关系之间摇摆不定。	The Brussels elites are not likely to admit this fact without further ado: their rhetoric still oscillates between doom-and-gloom pessimism and a kind of pro-European PR that is concerned only with how best to “sell” the Union to Europe’s citizens.
冷战结束已经整整20年了，对于那些意识形态斗争中真正意义上的 “间接受害者 ” ， 西方有时也会意识到自己的补偿责任。	Twenty years after the Cold War’s end, the West has at times recognized its duty to make amends to those who were, in a very real sense, the “collateral damage” of that ideological struggle.
阿富汗战争是美国打得最久的战争，花费（到目前为止）超过了5550亿美元，更有上千万阿富汗人民和近3100名美国士兵丧命。	The US fought its longest-ever war in Afghanistan, at a cost (so far) of more than $555 billion, not to mention tens of thousands of Afghan civilian casualties and close to 3,100 US troops killed.
《世界经济展望》强调这些因素的暂时性质，认定尽管世界GDP增长在上半年只有大约3 % ， 但会在下半年加速。	Emphasizing the temporary nature of these factors, the reports insist that, though world GDP growth amounted to roughly 3% during the first half of the year, it will pick up in the second half.
然而，另一个符合生物学和地质学事实的替代解释是，在数百万年中，我们已经演进了一种可以产生有关对错的直觉的道德能力。	But an alternative explanation, consistent with the facts of biology and geology, is that over millions of years we have evolved a moral faculty that generates intuitions about right and wrong.
在反犹热情问题上，侯赛尼的记录几乎不需要任何虚假的注脚 — — 除非，显而易见，有人想把巴勒斯坦人说成是大屠杀的同谋。	When it comes to anti-Jewish zeal, Husseini’s record hardly needs false footnotes – unless, apparently, one has an interest in presenting the Palestinians as co-perpetrators of the Holocaust.
据Massolution研究公司的数据，众筹市场呈现出指数增长特点，其规模从2010年8.8亿美元增加到2014年162亿美元。	According to the research firm Massolution, the crowdfunding market has grown exponentially, from $880 million in 2010 to $16.2 billion in 2014.
十年前，德国还是欧洲病夫，如今，崛起的德国固执（也可以说是草率）地对强化了它的经济的改革反其道而行之。	Having emerged from the position of the sick man of Europe only a decade ago, Germany is now willfully, if thoughtlessly, undoing the reforms that had so strengthened its economy.
选举时我们就在那儿，而且走访了8家城乡投票点，还和大约100名投票民众、选举官员、观察家和6个政党的官方人士进行了交谈。	We were there, and visited eight urban and rural polling places, talked with roughly a hundred voters, election officials and observers, as well as officials from six parties.
而韩国也实现了类似的转变，从1996~1997年度相当于GDP的2.8%经常账户逆差变成1998~1999年度的8.6%顺差	A similar transformation occurred in South Korea, where a 2.8% current-account deficit in 1996-1997 became an 8.6% surplus in 1998-1999.
因此，将特朗普支持者一般化地称为种族主义者或如希拉里·克林顿所言，把他们称为“可悲”和“不可救药”效果是灾难性的。	Hence the disastrous effect of generalizing about Trump’s supporters as racists or, as Hillary Clinton did, “deplorables” who are “irredeemable.”
如果两个或三个国家不得不离开，那么许多国家都会感到挫败感、信任的缺失以及深深的伤害，这将振动整个欧盟。	The sense of failure, loss of trust, and the damage inflicted on so many if two or three countries had to leave would shake the entire Union.
但波斯湾国家武装叙利亚反对派的动作不足以决定性地解决这场冲突，特别是在巴沙尔政权拥有重武器的情况下。	But the efforts of the Gulf states to arm the Syrian opposition are insufficient to set the conflict on a definitive course, especially given the heavy weapons that the Assad regime has at its disposal.
如果银行大到不能倒闭时，监管者就应该出手，监管职业式证券交易的赔偿方案，以确保风险和受益正确地配置。	If a bank is too big to fail, regulators should go even further, and regulate proprietary traders’ compensation packages to ensure that risks and rewards are properly aligned.
谨慎设计的公私合作 — — 国家直接向穷人发放补贴，然后穷人从私人农民和贸易商手中购买粮食 — — 能让所有人受益。	A carefully designed public-private partnership – in which the state gives a subsidy directly to the poor, who then buy food from private farmers and traders – would benefit all.
笔者认为这项事务并非与伊斯兰教本身有关：在欧洲，天主教在一段长的历史时期内都是民主和自由的最大敌人。	The issue, one should emphasize, is not Islam as such: in Europe, the Catholic Church was for a long time the greatest enemy of democracy and liberalism.
类似地，绝大多数欧洲国家 — — 从芬兰到葡萄牙 — — 都不想毫无保护地暴露在俄罗斯核弹头的打击范围之下。	Likewise, the vast majority of European countries – from Finland to Portugal – have no wish to reside in the shadow of Russian nuclear warheads with nothing to protect them.
如果我们要让经济增长与能源消费脱钩，在拥有九十亿人口的世界中实现真正的资源效率，更不用说保证所有人的公平，就不能让经济挂帅。	If we are to decouple economic growth from energy consumption and achieve real resource efficiency in a world of nine billion, much less ensure justice for all, we cannot let the economy lead the way.
新政（交易）建立的形象是商业交易，比方说企业收购或者高管激励 — — 签约双方可以在讨价还价之余达成一致。	The New Deal created an image of a commercial transaction, like the buyout of a company or an incentive package for executives – something that contracting parties bargain over and agree to.
如果你的移动电话是在印度组装的，但是是在芬兰研发和设计的，那么它是一个印度产品还是是一个芬兰产品呢？	If your mobile phone was assembled in India, but developed and designed in Finland, is it an Indian or a Finnish product?
其实，哈马斯早在2012年就曾对迪莫纳反应堆发动过类似的袭击，1991年伊拉克也进行过同样的努力，目的是释放该反应堆内容物，从而对以色列民众造成辐射。	In fact, Hamas made similar attempts to attack the Dimona complex in 2012, as did Iraq in 1991, with the aim of releasing the site’s contents to inflict radiological damage on Israel’s population.
麦肯锡的研究表明，页岩能源和大数据技术将在未来数年内给美国经济的潜在增长带来等量齐观的好处，它们是新的局面改变因素。	McKinsey’s research suggests that shale energy and big-data technologies will be game changers with similar benefits for the economy’s potential growth over the next several years.
只有两大事件有力量激发起民众的爱国主义情绪： 1917年的10月革命和1941-1945年的卫国战争。 卫国战争使苏联和俄罗斯得以跻身于世界强国之列。	Only two events have the power to mobilize and energize this sense of patriotism: the October revolution of 1917 and the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, which turned the USSR and Russia into a great world power.
自从美国宇航局前科学家詹姆斯·汉森首次“高度自信地”警告人类活动正在导致地球变暖以来，30年已经过去。	Three decades have passed since former NASA scientist James Hansen first warned “with a high degree of confidence” that human activity was making the planet hotter.
自文化大革命以来，中共一直遵循一条不成文的规矩，政治局常委，不管在任还是退休，都可以获得刑事豁免权。	Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, the CCP has adhered to the implicit rule that members of the Politburo Standing Committee, sitting or retired, enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution.
大量老人和退休人员意味着医疗保健和社会保障开支现在占到总体预算的29.2 % ， 比2000年增长了三分之一。	The large number of elderly and retired people means that spending on health care and social security now consumes 29.2% of the budget, a one-third increase since 2000.
这个议程包括中国人民银行和各外国央行之间的货币互换协议谈判，而目前已签署超过24项。 它还包括指定中国金融机构为每个主要金融中心的人民币交易提供清算和结算服务（例如9月份中国银行就被选为纽约的官方清算银行 ） 。	The Chinese argue that the renminbi’s addition to the SDR basket should be seen in a broader context.
而我之所以认为这场战争不可能获胜的原因，是因为它违反了“鲍威尔法则 ” ， 而这条法则是 18 年前时任美国参谋长联席会议主席的柯林斯·鲍威尔根据第一次海湾战争的经验总结出来的。	And I believe that it is unwinnable because it fails to comply with the tenets of the Powell Doctrine, elaborated 18 years ago by Colin Powell, then Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, in relation to the first Gulf War.
鲁哈尼明确指出，他想通过取消4,700万注册公民的月度津贴，以此为新医疗保险提供资金。 注册公民月度津贴是内贾德在取消大量补贴后采取的措施。	Rouhani has made it clear that he wants to pay for the new health care by phasing out the monthly state stipends paid to more than seventy-four million registered citizens, which Ahmadinejad offered when he eliminated a wide range of subsidies.
一位记者最近表达观点认为法国在欧洲的特殊作用是源于其“中心性 ” ， 即法国人同等地对世界开放而又执著于本国。	A journalist recently expressed the view that France’s special role in Europe was due to its “centrality,” meaning that the French are, in equal measure, both open to the world and attached to their nation.
组织必须采取更多的行动来增加自己在网络，学校和大学的曝光率，因为学生往往是最容易接受全球公民这一概念的人。	The Fund must also do more to enhance its presence on the Web and in school and university classrooms, especially as students are often the most receptive to ideas about global citizenship.
2005年，国际社会重申其帮助最贫困国家实现联合国千年发展目标的承诺，该目标计划到2015年将贫困减少一半。	In 2005, the international community renewed its commitments to help the poorest countries meet the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s), which aim to halve poverty by 2015.
而在欧洲，党派纪律非常强大，并且由党派、而不是候选者个人，负责为竞选活动提供资金，因此金钱所起的作用相对就没有那么重要。	In Europe, where party discipline is strong and the parties, not the individual candidates, finance election campaigns, money plays a smaller role.
当我就此提出疑问时，政府雇员解释说 — — 这对他们来说是理所当然的 — — “人们只有有问题了才会打电话来 。 ”	When I asked about it, the employees explained what to them was obvious: “People call offices only about problems.”
去年12月议定的巴黎协定是一项重大成就，是为了应对我们的未来福祉和繁荣所面临的最危险、最复杂的威胁而做出的前所未有的政治团结表现。	The Paris agreement, concluded last December, was a major accomplishment and an unprecedented display of political unity in the effort to tackle one of the most dangerous and complicated threats to our future welfare and prosperity.
与罗斯福不同，他完全理解所面临的经济挑战的性质，而且像丘吉尔一样，他同样拥有了民众的支持，他的人民愿意在民族团结的大背景下追随他的脚步，至少在短期内确实如此。	Unlike Roosevelt, he has a perfect understanding of the nature of the economic challenges facing him, and, like Churchill, he benefits from the support of a population ready to follow him in a climate of national unity, at least in the short run.
石油、金属和粮食价格自2003年以来增长迅猛，在2008—2011年间创出了历史高位，但没人预计未来还会出现如此价格涨势。	While prices of oil, metals, and food rose very significantly after 2003, reaching historic highs sometime between 2008 and 2011, nobody expects similar price increases in the future.
如果没有2011年的爆发，那么阿拉伯人将度过又一个独裁的年头，大街小巷上流传的将更多的是王朝传承的问题。	If the 2011 uprisings had not occurred, we would now be witnessing another year of autocracy, with more talk of dynastic successions.
财富税的道德问题在今天比以往更具紧迫性，因为如今的失业率仍处在衰退水平，而深刻的经济不平等正在挑战社会规范。	The moral case for a wealth tax is more compelling than usual today, with unemployment still at recession levels, and with deep economic inequality straining social norms.
此外，在减排约60-70%的情况下，探索更多的减排机会将不会影响 — — 或者甚至能增强 — — 行业的竞争力。	Moreover, in an estimated 60-70% of cases, exploring the additional abatement opportunity would have no effect – or would even strengthen – the industry’s competitiveness.
像埃尔多安这样的领袖很容易落入普京的现代专制主义陷阱，现代独裁主义利用假新闻和民主陷阱来支撑统治者的个人力量。	Leaders like Erdoğan easily fall for Putin’s brand of modern dictatorship, which relies on disinformation and the trappings of democracy to bolster the ruler’s personal power.
皮克提和他的合作者阿玛努尔·萨茨（Emmanuel Saez）所描述的过去15年中的事实包含了晦涩难懂的学术争论。	There are various arcane technical debates surrounding the facts that Piketty has established over the past 15 years with his co-author Emmanuel Saez.
比如，中国与巴基斯坦完成了数十亿美元的交易，在瓜达尔开发港口，原因就在于这里霍尔木兹海峡口的战略区位，这足以抵消该港口商业潜力有限的弊端。	For example, China concluded a multi-billion dollar deal with Pakistan to develop the port at Gwadar, owing to its strategic location at the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz, which more than offsets the port's limited commercial potential.
此外，巴切莱特的儿子卷入了腐败丑闻，执政的中左翼联盟尽显弱势，中右翼在2017年的总统选举中重获权力的可能性日增。	Add to that corruption scandals involving Bachelet’s son and weaknesses in the ruling center-left coalition, and the center right’s return to power in the 2017 presidential election seems increasingly likely.
这些风险包括可能由贸易战导致的消极的供给冲击、由出于政治动机的供给约束导致的石油价格上涨，以及美国国内的通胀性政策。	These risks include the negative supply shock that could come from a trade war; higher oil prices, owing to politically motivated supply constraints; and inflationary domestic policies in the US.
正如美国财政部长小摩根索（Henry Morgenthau, Jr . ） 在会议前夕所指出的 ， “ 我们感到这次会议对世界有利，对国家有利，对民主党有利，因此我们上了 。 ”	As US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. stated in advance of the conference, “We felt that it was good for the world, good for the nation, and good for the Democratic Party, for us to move.”
更深层次的经济衰退 — — 就像委员会计划所预期的那样 — — 将进一步减少岛内机会，从而促使更多移民流向大陆。	A deeper recession – as anticipated by the Board’s plan – will further decrease opportunities in the island, fueling more migration to the mainland.
当人们吸入PM2.5时，细小的固体和液体灰尘、污垢、有机化学物质和金属液滴可以深入肺部，甚至进入到血液当中。	When people inhale PM2.5, microscopic solids and liquid droplets of dust, dirt, organic chemicals, and metals can travel deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream.
现在，显然克里米亚不会再回到基辅手中；但同样显然的是5月选举的延期将意味着乌克兰的末日，我们都知道这一点。	It is now clear that Crimea will not return to Kyiv; but it is also clear that postponement of the May election will mean the end of Ukraine, as we know it.
本月早些时候，国际食品巨头嘉吉选择该市著名的拉斯维加斯大道发布它所期待的下一代重磅产品：与甜叶菊有着相同成分的甜味剂EverSweet。	Earlier this month, the international food conglomerate Cargill chose the city’s famous Strip to introduce what it hopes will be its next blockbuster product: EverSweet, a sweetener made of “the same sweet components in the stevia plant.”
任何破坏国际贸易这一战后全球经济增长主要引擎的做法将不可避免地提高每个人的生活成本 — — 包括那些作为特朗普政治基础的劳动阶层。	Any effort to undermine international trade – a leading engine of global economic growth since the end of WWII – will inevitably impose high costs on everyone, including the working-class members of Trump’s political base.
目前，印度外交部长苏什马·斯瓦拉伊（Sushma Swaraj）默默地 警告，如果中国 — — 目前其对印度贸易有每年600亿美元的盈余 — — 继续干扰边境和平，将对其采取经济制裁。	Already, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has tacitly warned of economic sanctions if China, which is running an annual trade surplus of nearly $60 billion with India, continues to disturb border peace.
克里米亚已经归附俄罗斯（许多人认为是吞并 ） ； 东乌克兰大部被亲俄叛军占据；西方和俄罗斯的关系也比冷战初期以来的任何时候都要紧张。	Crimea has been reabsorbed by Russia (in what many consider an annexation); much of eastern Ukraine is held by pro-Russia rebels; and relations between the West and Russia are more tense than at any time since the early days of the Cold War.
工党和保守党均存在内部分裂，但两党各自的领导人杰里米·科尔宾和特雷莎·梅都坚决致力于实现脱欧目标，以至于他们同意合作。	Both Labour and the Conservatives are internally divided, but their leaders, Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, respectively, are so determined to deliver Brexit that they have agreed to cooperate to attain it.
防务五十年来一直依赖美国，在欧洲形成了强大的“和平产业 ” ， 其主要业务就是竭尽全力与国防开支作斗争。	Fifty years of defense dependence on the US has created a powerful “peace industry” in Europe whose primary business is to fight defense spending tooth and nail.
即使6月选举后上台的新政府让退出暂时中止，老方一帖的无用政策（必须的紧缩和结构性改革）也不能重塑增长和竞争力。	Postponing the exit after the June election with a new government committed to a variant of the same failed policies (recessionary austerity and structural reforms) will not restore growth and competitiveness.
不管西方政策曾经多么险恶，伊斯兰教力量终究是阿拉伯土地上的自然结果，是对阿拉伯世俗民族主义和现代阿拉伯国家失败的真实反应。	However pernicious Western policies might have been, Islamist forces are a natural outcome in Arab lands, a genuine response to the failures of secular Arab nationalism and the modern Arab state.
为了理解这一点，可以考虑以下问���：美国或其他国家认真地建议伊朗签署核不扩散条约 — — 即让伊朗放弃核弹是在什么时候。	To see this, consider the following question: When was the last time that the US or anyone else seriously proposed that India sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – that is, that India give up the Bomb.
虽然减少二氧化碳排放和如何筹集减排资金是必然目标，但地缘政治的现实告诉我们，气候变化问题不可能脱离了贸易或者货币汇率，国际货币基金组织，联合国改革等种种议题来进行讨论。	Although cuts in CO2 emissions and agreement on funding and finance are necessary goals, the geopolitical reality is that climate change cannot be decoupled from trade or discussions on exchange rates, the IMF, reform of the UN, and so on.
热浪、干旱、洪水、森林大火、冰川消融、河流污染、极端暴风肆虐地球的频率越来越高，而这一切都是人类活动导致的。	Heat waves, droughts, floods, forest fires, retreating glaciers, polluted rivers, and extreme storms buffet the planet at a dramatically rising rate, owing to human activities.
在减贫、疾病控制和普及全球最贫困国家（特别是非洲国家）的教育和基础设施等方面，MDG确实带来了令人瞩目的成就。	There has been marked progress on poverty reduction, disease control, and increased access to schooling and infrastructure in the poorest countries of the world, especially in Africa, as a result of the MDGs.
2013年，美国能源部批准了第一批大规模天然气出口设施；尽管这一气源并未形成稳定的天然气流，但美国和全球气价之间的差异意味着它潜力无限。	In 2013, the US Department of Energy authorized the first substantial gas-export facilities; while the trickle is not yet a steady flow, the gap between US and much-higher world prices implies tremendous potential benefits.
投资者有时会获得不错的收益，尽管有很多情况下都是内部人员通过为自己开出过分慷慨的报酬，执行高风险操作或实施其他更为欺诈性的做法来攫取超出本分的好处。	Investors sometimes get a good ride, though there are plenty of instances where insiders take excessive advantage by awarding themselves overly generous compensation, taking on excessive risk, or engaging in other, more devious practices.
欧盟在庆祝克罗地亚入盟 — — 这毫无疑问会给整个西巴尔干地区的改革过程带来短期提振 — — 但其进入该地区面临着重大抉择。	As the EU celebrates the accession of Croatia – which will undoubtedly provide a short-term boost to the reform process throughout the western Balkans – it faces a profound choice in its engagement with the region.
发布声明对无法形成谈判解决办法表示遗憾、提出明确的短期和长期计划管理违约、列明令人信服的复苏和增长战略要好得多。	Issuing a statement of regret at the inability to reach a negotiated solution, offering clear short- and long-term plans to manage the default, and outlining a compelling strategy for recovery and growth would be far preferable.
多数欧洲国家都产生了强烈的政治反弹，原因是移民流入速度过快（仅去年一年移民人数就超过百万）和许多新移民的穆斯林背景。	In most European countries, the political backlash has been sharp, owing to the rapid rate of the inflows (more than a million people in the past year) and the Muslim background of many of the newcomers.
发自新德里 — — 在大多数全球化的批评者眼中贸易是罪魁祸首，加剧了劳动者之间的不平等和日益严重的经济不安全感。	NEW DELHI – For most critics of globalization, trade is the villain, responsible for deepening inequality and rising economic insecurity among workers.
它所推动的两项大型协议 — — 包含12国的《跨太平洋伙伴关系协议》以及《跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系协议 》 — —将使美国成为涵盖全球经济总量三分之二的整合性市场的核心。	The two grand agreements that it pursued – the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – would have put the US at the center of an integrated market comprising two-thirds of the global economy.
随后的大屠杀是一次有预谋、成系统、遍及全国，其中爪哇中部和东部、巴厘和苏门答腊北部的暴力最恐怖、最严重。	The resulting carnage was deliberate, systematic, and spanned the country, with the most horrific and intense violence in Central and East Java, Bali, and northern Sumatra.
2014年，美国出口了4,000亿美元的需要信息和通讯技术的服务 — — 占美国服务出口总量的近一半。	In 2014, the US exported $400 billion in information and communication technologies (ICT)-enabled services – almost half of all US services exports.
在目前困难重重的全球经济及地缘政治环境下，只有充分发挥每一美元多边发展资金的作用才有可能实现可持续发展目标。	In a challenging global economic and geopolitical environment, achieving the SDGs will be possible only if we make the most of every multilateral development dollar.
距离第三次以色列对加沙开战不到六年后，许多巴勒斯坦人开始质疑继续战斗的目的，希望能出现不必增加他们的痛苦的解决方案。	After the third Israeli war on Gaza in less than six years, many Palestinians are questioning the purpose of continuing to fight – and hoping for a solution that does not increase their suffering.
而纽约人也越来越对关于地铁英雄的报道司空见惯 — — 那些勇敢的人奋不顾身跳下铁轨营救失足的旅客，却往往在他人安全脱险之后悄悄溜走，不希望引起注意，也不渴望得到表扬。	And New Yorkers have grown accustomed to reading about subway heroes – brave souls who leap onto the tracks to rescue fallen commuters and then often slip away, uncomfortable with attention or credit.
东京—当日本首相安倍晋三拜访存在争议的东京靖国神社时，中国领导人如意料之中谴责安倍瞻仰“侵华战争”背后的人。	TOKYO – When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Tokyo’s controversial Yasukuni Shrine last month, Chinese leaders predictably condemned his decision to honor those behind “the war of aggression against China.”
讽刺的是，正是这一识字率提高和现代技术的组合煽动着两类“改革者 ” — —宗教复兴派和西方导向的现代派之间的冲突之火。	Ironically, it is the combination of increased literacy and modern technology that is fanning the flames of conflict between the two types of “reformers” – religious revivalists and Western-oriented modernizers.
一个对极端主义日渐缺乏免疫力的社会中 — — 再加上一个完全失效的政府 — — 当局实际上是在引火烧身。	In a society with weakened immunity to extremism – and with an utterly dysfunctional government – the authorities are, perhaps literally, playing with fire.
2001年9月11日恐怖份子对美国发动攻击以来的安全环境已经清楚地表明联合国、甚至作为世界唯一超级军事大国的美国在维持国际安全方面上的局限性。	The security environment since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States has clearly demonstrated the limits of the United Nations, or even the US as the world’s sole military superpower, to maintain international security.
目前也正和中国发生激烈领土冲突的菲律宾外长不顾本国曾在日本占领中所受的痛苦，要求日本重新武装以维持对华的军事平衡。	The foreign minister of the Philippines, which is also currently engaged in a heated territorial conflict with China, called on Japan to rearm itself to balance China militarily, notwithstanding his country’s bitter legacy of Japanese occupation.
无论从旅行的方便程度还是他们定居的生活条件，以上两者的经历都与希望在德国等待叙利亚内战结束的叙利亚难民的经历大不相同。	From the ease of the journey to the living conditions into which they settle, both the experiences of both are very different from those of a refugee from Syria hoping to wait out that country’s civil war in Germany.
但如果它最终提醒我们自由贸易给人们带来的风险，以及我们是否改善了我们的保险机制来帮助他们，那么它可能会得到有一个圆满的结局。	But it could have a happy ending if it eventually reminds us of the risks that free trade imposes on people, and if we improve our insurance mechanisms to help them.
财富可以被重新定义和界定，从而将获得基本商品和服务 — — 包括清洁空气、稳定气候、清洁水源等自然免费提供之物 — — 包括进来？	Can wealth be redefined and reframed to include access to basic goods and services, including those provided by nature free of cost, such as clean air, a stable climate, and fresh water?
阿盟应该公开要求安理会放弃其维持国际和平和安全的责任，号召在该地区有重大利益的各国加入它们，采取行动。	The Arab League should publicly charge the Security Council with abdicating its responsibility for preserving international peace and security and call on countries with important interests in the region to join with them in taking action.
政治领导人不偏不倚地对他们表示信心、允许他们不受干扰地展开工作、不去胡乱质疑他们的结论，这是其中的关键。	It is crucial that political leaders express confidence in their impartiality, allow them to carry out their work unobstructed, and not second-guess their conclusions.
例如，接管或压制私人媒体不仅会带来与反对派的冲突，而且会触动根深蒂固的商业利益，而后者在国外的影响力远比波兰饱受批评的法院大得多。	Taking over or suppressing the private media, for example, would bring the party into conflict not just with the opposition, but also with entrenched business interests, which carry much more clout abroad than Poland’s beleaguered courts do.
我们完全可以建立一个新的全球融资体系，将储蓄引向需要最紧迫的领域：可持续发展和气候安全 — — 为了我们自己和我们的子孙后代。	We have within our reach the makings of a new global financial system that directs savings where they are urgently needed: sustainable development and climate safety, for ourselves and for future generations.
脱欧倡导者提出，一旦摆脱有缺陷的共同农业政策束缚，英国就可以建立一个更具竞争力的农业部门，更好地服务于农民和农业工作者的利益，包括减少依赖扭曲资源配置的补贴。	Once freed from the flawed CAP, Brexit’s proponents argue, the UK will be able to build a more competitive agricultural sector that better serves farmers and agricultural workers, including by reducing dependence on distorting subsidies.
多边贷款机构可以通过限制对煤这种最具（气候）破坏性化石燃料的公共融资条件并对排放报告要求更高的透明度来树立榜样。	Multilateral lenders can lead by example by restricting conditions for public financing of coal, the most damaging fossil fuel, and by pressing for greater transparency in reporting on emissions.
如果中国能够帮助找到一种方法，来对高贷款审核标准和无可避免的快速分散贷款项目进行平衡，全球经济治理就将极大受益。	If China can help find a way to balance the need for high standards and safeguards in project lending with the imperative of rapid loan dispersion, global economic governance would benefit significantly.
在2000年，欧��制定了一个经过协议的改革目标的十年计划，然而在很大程度上其成员国缺乏实施这些目标的政治意愿。	In 2000, the EU set a ten-year program of agreed reform targets, yet in many cases its member states have lacked the political will to implement them.
为了抵消这一影响，美国众议院议长保罗·瑞恩（Paul Ryan）提出在此前基础上增加净进口（进口减去出口）税。	To offset this, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, has proposed adding a tax on net imports (imports minus exports).
但仍存在巨大的不确定性，不仅是关于最近沪深交易所崩盘的原因的不确定性，还包括关于此次崩盘对中国金融改革意味着什么的不确定性。	But considerable uncertainty remains, not only about what caused the recent plunge in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, but also about what the episode will mean for China’s financial-reform efforts.
但是，尽管法兰西的民族认同与法国的国际地位 — — 即它在世界人民心目中的形象 — — 息息相关，干预的热情却在减退。	But, while French national identity is intimately bound up with France’s international standing – how it is perceived in the world – enthusiasm for intervention has receded.
本意是让欧洲能够更好响应外部变化的流程现在必须进行反思，以体现欧洲人认识到如今需要经历根本性转型的是欧盟本身。	A process that was intended to enable Europe to respond better to external changes now must be rethought to reflect the recognition that it is the EU which is now set to undergo a fundamental transformation.
事实上，像戈培尔一样，苏尔科夫明白当公共生活和私人表达可以用来作秀，那么表演和现实之间就已经没有任何区别。	Indeed, like Goebbels, Surkov understands that when public life and private expression can be turned into theater, there is no difference between performance and reality.
但如果现在形势朝着有利于偏好更开放的系统和更激烈的有意义的政治竞争的人的方向发展，我们也不必感到惊奇。	But it would not be a surprise if the pendulum now starts to swing back in favor of those who would prefer more open systems and a greater degree of meaningful political competition.
当然，奥巴马不必为俄罗斯入侵和吞并克里米亚负责，也不必为普京在乌克兰东境集结俄军以恐吓基辅政府负责。	Of course, Obama is not responsible for Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea, or for Putin’s massing of Russian troops on Ukraine’s eastern border in an effort to intimidate the government in Kyiv.
但是大门毕竟已经敞开，这是研究策略概念化并以种族为制药基础迈出的第一步，接下来的进展也不会等待太久。	Here was the foot in the door, the first step toward conceptualizing strategies of research and then delivery of drugs to populations that are defined by ethnicity and race. The next step was not long in coming.
俄罗斯总统警告说 ， “ 今天，许多国家都忙于修改自己的价值观念和道德准则，因此削弱了民族传统及民族文化差异 。 ”	“Today, many nations,” he warned, “are revising their moral values and ethical norms, eroding ethnic traditions and differences between peoples and cultures.”
尽管该体系在1971年已事实解体，但美元在国际货币体系中的核心地位并未受到动摇 — — 许多国家日益不愿接受这一现实。	While the system was effectively eliminated in 1971, the US dollar’s central role in the international monetary system has remained intact – a reality that many countries are increasingly unwilling to accept.
如今，中东乱局又使油价进一步上涨，迫使美国人为原油进口付出更多的钱，这些钱原本可以用来购买美国制造的商品。	Then, as now, disruption in the Middle East led to higher oil prices, forcing Americans to spend money on oil imports that they otherwise could have spent buying goods produced in the US.
而尽管我不是英国大使，但我仍然乐于表明我的态度：英国政府加入亚投行是明智之举，而美国政府表示反对不是明智之举。	And though I am not the British ambassador, I will be happy to state my belief that the UK government was wise to join the AIIB, and that the US administration, in voicing its opposition, was not.
潜在的借款国已经积累了巨量的资金储备，并在一定区域内汇集这些储备以使自己免于外部冲击和投机资本的危害，但是这不是在国际货币基金组织的敦促下完成的。	Potential borrowers have been accumulating massive reserves and pooling them regionally to protect themselves against shocks and speculative capital, but not at the Fund’s urging.
考虑到这一点，可以预期中国将继续在一定程度上管理资本账户交易，包括使用宏观审慎政策以及在适当时候采取直接资本管制。	Given this, China can be expected to continue to manage capital-account transactions to some extent, using macroprudential measures and, when appropriate, direct capital controls.
其次，随着反全球化的主角们纷纷涌现并质疑主流正统政治观念，老牌政党都从内部产生了分化 — — 如果不能称之为破坏的话。	Second, establishment parties are being disrupted – if not destroyed – from within, as champions of anti-globalization emerge and challenge the mainstream orthodoxy.
全世界范围内，在像中东这样一块动荡不安的土地上重建一个满目战争疮痍、内部四分五裂、又遭外国干涉力量困扰的国家，其艰难程度难以想象。	Rebuilding a country devastated by war, riven by internal divisions, and plagued by foreign intervention in a part of the world as volatile as the Middle East is one of the most daunting tasks imaginable.
有些央行官员喜欢回忆温斯顿·丘吉尔为决战英国的英雄主义者所唱的赞歌 ： “ 如此多的人欠少数人巨额债务的状况在人类历史上是绝无仅有的 。 ”	Some central bankers like to recall Winston Churchill’s paean to the heroism of those who fought the decisive Battle of Britain: “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.”
上述举措再加上为快速增长的青年人口更好地提供支持和机遇一道，理应在未来五年内将失业率从11.6%降到9 % 。	That, together with improved support and opportunities for the fast-growing population of young people, should reduce the unemployment rate from 11.6% to 9% in the next five years.
事实上，在参拜靖国神社前一天，他刚刚完成了长期未能完成的美国所支持的双边协议，将美国驻冲绳空军基地迁往冲绳岛人口较少的地区。	Indeed, Abe’s visit to Yasukuni came only a day after he completed a long-elusive, US-backed bilateral deal to relocate America’s airbase in Okinawa to a less populous area of the island.
伟大的军事思想家克劳斯·冯·克劳塞维茨关于将“决定性战役”作为战争的“重心”的理念在全然没有“重心”的冲突中也失去了用武之地。	The great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz’s notion of “decisive battles” as the “center of gravity” of war is simply irrelevant to conflicts that have no visible “center of gravity.”
不过，这个数字却在美国媒体和政府一致宣称的“无平民伤亡战争”的说法中被策略性地忽略了。 因为他们眼里没有无辜百姓，只有伊拉克叛军士兵。	Yet this carnage is systematically ignored in the United States, where the media and government portray a war in which there are no civilian deaths, because there are no Iraqi civilians, only insurgents.
不过，我也再一次看到了战胜贫困的社区精神力量 — — 那种让五十年前让韩国实现农村现代化的团结与坚定。	Yet I also saw, once again, the power of community spirit to overcome it – the same sense of solidarity and determination that launched Korea’s rural modernization five decades ago.
此外，如果通胀在未来数年略有上升，2008年金融危机爆发以来的去杠杆化也会更加容易，IMF在一年前就鼓励讨论这样做。	Moreover, the deleveraging underway since the 2008 financial implosion could be easier if inflation were moderately higher for a few years, a debate the International Monetary Fund encouraged a year ago.
例如，唐纳德·特朗普总统非常富有，而且名气比任何与他竞选美国总统的对手，包括希拉里·克林顿，都要大。	President Donald Trump, for example, is a very wealthy man, who was more famous than any of his rivals for the US presidency, including Hillary Clinton.
尽管包括国家安全委员会高级亚洲主管在内的美国低级官员曾经会晤缅甸对口部门，并就权利问题向其施压，但特朗普却从未对洪森的所作所为进行过任何负面评价。	And although lower-ranking US officials, including the Senior Director for Asia on the National Security Council, have met with their Cambodian counterparts to press them on rights issues, Trump has said nothing negative about Hun Sen’s actions.
由于还在超过一千个论点上未能达成共识，因此最近跟我交流过的所有政策制定者都说，他们看不到能在12月哥本哈根出台一个有实际意义之协议的可能性。	With more than a thousand points still to be agreed, all the policymakers I’ve spoken to recently say that they cannot see how a meaningful deal can be reached by December in Copenhagen.
虽然特朗普的单边主义将破坏以规则为基础的国际秩序，但一个未能保持上述联系的真正孤立内向的美国将会造成更大的损失。	As damaging as Trump’s unilateralism will be to the rules-based international order, its consequences would pale in comparison to the harm wrought by a truly isolationist and withdrawn US that fails to uphold these bonds.
所以，除非美国开始更多地储蓄，否则，它将很难对为外部赤字提供资金的形式，也就是股本而非债务提出抱怨。	So unless the US starts to save more, it will find it hard to complain about the form – equity rather than debt – that the financing of its external deficit takes.
在这个正确的方向下，在改革的过程中维持相对稳定快速的增长，并避免硬着陆，不仅对中国有利，还能确保全球经济所亟需的增长与稳定。	With the right approach, relatively stable and rapid growth can be maintained throughout the reform process. Avoiding a hard landing would be good not only for China; it would ensure much-needed growth and stability for the global economy.
并且，确实也从来没有哪一位日本首相在南京下跪过，就像德国总理勃兰登在华沙的犹太人区所做的那样，他在那里为德国的罪行表示了道歉 ， “ 没有人能够逃脱历史 ， ” 他说道。	And, true, no Japanese prime minister has yet fallen to his knees in Nanjing the way Chancellor Willy Brandt did on the site of the Warsaw Ghetto, where he apologized for the crimes of Germany by saying, “No people can escape from their history.”
正如印度商业分析家维纶德拉·帕雷科（Virendra Parekh）所观察到的 ： “ 世界上增长第二快的国家现在一点都不值得羡慕，因为他们的金融市场在亚洲是堕落最快的 。 ”	As the Indian business analyst Virendra Parekh has observed: “The second fastest-growing economy in the world now has the unenviable distinction of having the fastest falling financial markets in Asia.”
除非20116年做出建设性政治动作，否则波多黎各向50州的移民规模将堪与20世纪30年代阿肯色州俄克拉荷马沙尘碗（Dust Bowl）大逃亡和其他被气候摧毁的州相提并论。	Unless a constructive course of political action is found in 2016, Puerto Rican migration to the 50 states will rival the scale of the 1930s Dust Bowl exodus from Oklahoma, Arkansas, and other climate-devastated states.
而数字化的生态系统 — — 不仅包括电子商务和支付平台，还包括社交媒体 — — 则成为了这些传统本地生态系统的涡轮增压版本。	Digitally enabled ecosystems – including not just e-commerce and payment platforms, but also social media – function as turbo-charged versions of these traditional local ecosystems.
他将毫无疑问地提高世卫组织的士气和世卫组织工作人员实现最大价值和效率的动力 — — 为了所有成员国和它们的人民的利益。	He would undoubtedly boost organizational morale and motivate the staff to deliver maximum value and efficiency – to the benefit of all member states and their citizens.
1月29日，圣彼得堡将举行列宁格勒保卫战胜利大阅兵，这可能会激发爱国主义，但并不能反映这座城市挨饿的居民的真实情景。	The grand military parade commemorating the anniversary of the end of the Siege of Leningrad, planned for January 29 in St. Petersburg, may inspire patriotism, but it will in no way reflect the real drama of the city’s starving inhabitants.
比如，在斯里兰卡，稻米产量到2050年可能下降高达20 % ； 而在斐济，木薯产量可能暴跌36 % 。	In Sri Lanka, for example, rice yields could drop by up to 20% by 2050; in Fiji, cassava output could plummet by 36%.
比如说，即使是美国和墨西哥之间轻微的贸易摩擦也会为汽车制造商带来极为高昂的成本，因为某些组件在整个生产过程中会穿越两国边界多达八次。	Even a mild trade tussle between the US and Mexico, for example, could be extremely costly for car manufacturers, given that some components currently cross the US border as many as eight times during the production process.
同时奥运会还存在成为一场政治马戏的危险，因为国际社会对奥运会的关注给公众抗议活动带来了令人难以拒绝的机会。	There is also the risk that the Games will become a political circus, as the international spotlight generates irresistible opportunities for public protest.
细菌的两种突变需要我们特别注意：以敌对形态发生，使他们具备超强抗药性的适应性突变；或是在“安全”的细菌群落中的致命性变种。	Bacteria should be checked for two types of mutation: adaptation by a hostile form that enables it to become super-immune to drugs, or a deadly mutant strain that appears in one of the multitude of “safe” bacteria.
正如奥巴马所说 ， “ 如果伊朗抓住这一机会，伊朗人民就能从重新回到国际社会获益良多，而我们也可以开始消弭存在于我们两国之间的不信任。	As Obama put it, “If Iran seizes this opportunity, the Iranian people will benefit from rejoining the international community, and we can begin to chip away at the mistrust between our two nations.
如今，反犹主义、伊斯兰恐惧症、种族主义、仇外主义和反移民情绪再次在欧洲横行，如今，我们必须停下来准确地评估一下我们身在何处。	Today, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, xenophobia, and anti-migrant sentiment are again rising across Europe, and we must stop now and reassess precisely where we are.
克里姆林宫的宣传向来主要渲染俄罗斯遭到袭击，而普京就是陷入敌对的西方重围的城堡上的指挥官 — — 军事、经济乃至国际体育领域的指挥官。	The narrative that Russia is under attack has long dominated Kremlin propaganda, with Putin positioning himself as the commander of a fortress besieged – militarily, economically, and even in the domain of international sports – by a hostile West.
伯克利—哈佛教授Dani Rodrik—可能是我们这一代最好的政治经济学家—最近在他的博客里说他的一位同事将过去的三十年称为“米尔顿•弗里德曼时代 ” 。	BERKELEY – Harvard professor Dani Rodrik – perhaps the finest political economist of my generation – recently reported on his blog that a colleague has been declaring the past three decades “the Age of Milton Friedman.”
但在过去五十年来一直研究这类问题的经济学家们（包括我）发现，围绕一些本质上毫无价值的资产的价格泡沫最终一定会爆破。	But economists (including me) who have worked on this kind of problem for five decades have found that price bubbles surrounding intrinsically worthless assets must eventually burst.
例如，欧洲在20国集团世界峰会上代表过多，但是四名欧洲国家领导人的出席，再加上像巴罗佐这样的欧盟代表，削弱而不是增强了欧洲的政治影响。	It is over-represented at G-20 world summits, for instance, but the presence of four European national leaders, plus EU representatives like Barroso, weakens rather than strengthens its political weight.
他们主要研究巴西的诺梅尔卡多 - - - 这是股票交易市场为首次公开募股公司新设立的交易平台。 他们研究这一平台是如何保护那些给新入市的公司注入资金的投资者的利益。	An analysis by Ronald Gilson, Henry Hansmann, and Mariana Pargendler of Brazil’s Novo Mercado – the stock exchange’s special voluntary listing segment, which provides strong protections for investors in newly listed companies – supports this view.
第二个障碍则是与格鲁吉亚的边境管制问题，而且主要还是政治上的：究竟阿布哈兹和南奥塞梯地区应该如俄方所言，是独立的政治实体，还是如世界所相信的那样是格鲁吉亚的一部分？	The second obstacle is border controls with Georgia, a mainly political issue: whether Abkhazia and South Ossetia are independent, as Russia maintains, or are part Georgia, as the rest of the world believes.
特别是，美联储和欧洲央行需要退出宽松货币政策 — — 特别是欧元区所保证的财政援助计划，该计划人为地将资本导向了南欧。	In particular, the Fed and the ECB need to end their loose monetary policies – especially the fiscal bailout packages and ECB guarantees that are artificially redirecting capital into Southern Europe.
事实上，随着最初的袭击和困惑已被更加冷静的审视所取代，在那个可怕的日子所发生的恐怖袭击正在日渐被认为是民族主义众多里程碑中的一个，确实应该如此。	In fact, now that the initial shock and confusion have given way to a more sober perspective, the terrorist attacks of that awful day are increasingly seen – as they should be – as one among numerous other nationalist milestones.
同样重要的是，央行需要向公众发出这样的讯号，即它现在关注实际汇率，因其对于出口、就业和可持续增长都很重要。	Equally important, the central bank needs to signal to the public that it now cares about the real exchange rate, because it is important to exports, jobs, and sustainable growth.
比如，2013年美联储暗示它将开始逐渐减少量化宽松计划之一，结果引发了“削减恐慌 ” （ taper tantrum ） ， 资金纷纷逃离债券市场，债券收益率飙升。	In 2013, for example, the US Federal Reserve’s suggestion that it would begin to taper off one of its quantitative easing programs triggered a “taper tantrum,” with money pouring out of the bond market and bond yields rising substantially.
现在，国际货币基金组织又提供了下面一针安慰剂 ： “ 你可能很吝啬，也可能没有信守你的承诺，但你的钱说到底可能也起不到什么作用 。 ”	Now, the IMF offers the following reassurance: ”You may be stingy, you may not be living up to your commitments, but the money probably wouldn’t have made much difference anyway.”
1986年，布坎南因将经济学家使用已久的对私人经济决策的有效分析引入对政府和政府官员行为的研究而获得诺贝尔经济学奖。	Buchanan was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1986 for bringing to the study of government and the behavior of government officials the same rigorous analysis that economists had long applied to private economic decision-making.
G-20成员国占了世界经济的85 % ， 它们肩负着应对这些影像这全世界数百万人生活与繁荣的挑战的责任。	The G-20, whose members account for about 85% of the world economy, has an important responsibility to respond to challenges that affect the lives and prosperity of millions of people around the world.
与此同时，四分之三的接近退休人群 — — 即50—64年龄段 — — 年收入低于52 201美元，总退休储蓄少于27 000美元。	Meanwhile, three-quarters of near-retirees – those aged 50-64 – have annual incomes below $52,201 and average total retirement savings of less than $27,000.
感谢卫星电视，全世界都可以在电视机前看到萨拉热窝的居民以联合国提供的食品为生、因周围群山中发来的炮击和冷枪而丧命。	Thanks to satellite television, the world had a front-row seat to watch the citizens of Sarajevo, who were kept alive by UN food deliveries, being killed by shelling and sniping from the surrounding hills.
我号召全国各州重新开始美国公民学的研究，以便我们将培养出这样的公民：他们懂得我们的遗产，并能在宪法和自由受到威胁的时候保卫它们。	I call on states throughout the land to re-institute the study of US civics so that we will produce citizens who understand our legacy and can defend liberty and the Constitution when it is threatened.
惠灵顿-扑热息痛（在美国又名醋氨酚）是世界上最常用的药物之一。 由于其安全性，它成为解热镇痛的首选药物。	WELLINGTON – Paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the United States) is one of the world’s most commonly used drugs.
第二个问题是将国际货币基金组织，而不是G-7 — — 或任何其他的G什么国家，置于全球宏观经济政策协调的中心���置的必要性。	The second issue is the need to place the IMF, not the G-7 – or any other “G” – at the center of global macroeconomic policy coordination.
由此导致的巴基斯坦邦级卫生体系的缺陷暴露无遗 — — 不但体现在无法消灭小儿麻痹症上，也体现在夺走300多名儿童生命的最新的麻疹大爆发上。	The resulting shortcomings in the country’s provincial health systems have manifested themselves not just in the inability to eradicate polio, but also in a recent measles outbreak, which has killed more than 300 children.
然而在美国，政府研发支出已经从20世纪80年代初占国内生产总值的1.2%下降到近年来占比仅为当时的一半。	Yet in the US, government R&D spending has fallen from 1.2% of GDP in the early 1980s to half that level in recent years.
据说一些美国官员现在正在考虑与巴沙尔结盟与伊斯兰国进行军事对抗，而后者的崛起正是拜美国所支持的暴乱所赐。	Some US officials are now reportedly considering an alliance with Assad to fight the militant Islamic State, whose rise was enabled by the US-backed insurrection.
它开始于一刀切的“移民”概念（一种法律异形）的建立，这一概念模糊了作为法律核心的区别，即经济和政治移民的区别，或者逃离贫困的人和因为战争而被迫离开家园的人的区别。	It began with the creation of the catch-all concept (a legal freak) of a “migrant,” which obscures the difference, central to the law, between economic and political migration, between people escaping poverty and those driven from their homes by war.
法国、美国、英国和土耳其已将叙利亚国民联盟（SNC）承认为未来过渡政府，尽管报告显示SNC的263位创始者中有三分之二与穆斯林兄弟会有关。	France, the US, the UK, and Turkey have recognized the Syrian National Coalition as Syria’s future interim government, despite reports that two-thirds of the SNC’s 263 founders are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood.
从他的导师和榜样身上汲取了如此之多公共和私生活灵感的首位法国社会党总统奥朗德会有一天被称为“小密特朗”吗？	Will Hollande, who seems to take so much inspiration for both his public and private life from his mentor and model, France’s first-ever Socialist president, one day be described as “Mitterrand le petit”?
最后，对于像美国、英国、法国和荷兰这样的发达国家，应该把对外援助用于大规模扩大在各基本领域非洲人培训。	Finally, foreign aid should be used to expand training massively for Africans in all the essential fields in rich countries like the US, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands.
我的好友贝塔·卡塞雷斯（Berta Cáceres）和我在2015年获得了戈德曼环境奖，贝塔在获奖演说上说道 ： “ 我将我的生命献给地球母亲 。 ”	When my dear friend Berta Cáceres and I won the prize in 2015, Berta said in her acceptance speech, “I have given my life for the service of mother earth.”
但发达国家的财政动作的空间比2007—2008年期间小了很多，美国政治僵局也有所深化，这些都排除了通过预算渠道实施进一步刺激的可能。	But the advanced economies’ room for fiscal maneuver is more limited than it was in 2007-2008, and America’s political gridlock has deepened, all but ruling out further stimulus through budgetary channels.
最近一次袭击是开罗赫尔旺（Helwan）郊区发生的抢手袭击便衣安全车事件，八名武装保安全部丧生，抢手随后消失在工人阶级的水泥丛林中。	Most recently, gunmen attacked an undercover security minibus in Cairo's Helwan suburb last May, killed all eight armed security agents, and vanished into the working-class cement jungle.
超过70%的土耳其人敌视美国，埃尔多安指责后者是社交媒体崛起的始作俑者（社交媒体是土耳其今天面临的“最大威胁 ” — —甚至似乎比伊斯兰国在土耳其城市发动的致命袭击威胁更大 ） 。	And more than 70% of Turks have a negative view of the US, which Erdoğan blames for the rise of social media (the “worst menace” facing Turkey today – trumping, it seems, even the Islamic State’s deadly attacks in Turkish cities).
各国政府为了缓解危机，不但要提供一系列公开援助，制定保障存款的新法律，还要帮助他们的选民抵御日渐不稳的国际影响。	Governments not only needed to help by providing a combination of public assistance and new legislation guaranteeing deposits, but also were called on to shield their constituencies from destabilizing international influences.
如果世界未能在这方面大幅加速推进和扩大相关投资，人口的快速增长将逆转当前所取得的成果, 儿童新娘的数量将再次增长。	If the world does not dramatically accelerate progress and scale up investments, rapid population growth will reverse current gains, and the number of child brides will grow once more.
上述举措导致孕产妇死亡率大幅下降，2005到2015年间从每100,000活产儿450例大幅下降至220例。	This contributed in a steep drop in the MMR, from 450 to 220 per 100,000 live births, between 2005 and 2015.
发自曼谷 — — 就在上星期，台湾台北市地方法院依贪污罪，判处曾于2000-2008年间任台湾总统的陈水扁无期徒刑。	BANGKOK – Last week, a Taiwanese court sentenced Chen Shui-bien, Taiwan’s president from 2000 until 2008, to life imprisonment for corruption.
倘若中国这个美国第三大和增长最快的出口市场也实施报复性关税，可能会使美国对该国的主要出口产品 — — 大豆、飞机、各类机械设备以及汽车零部件 — — 带来很大的麻烦。	For example, retaliatory tariffs by China – the third-largest and fastest-growing US export market – could put a real crimp in America’s leading exports to the country: soybeans, aircraft, a broad array of machinery, and motor vehicles parts.
如此，某些妄想类似米洛塞维奇一样所犯罪行的人必须认识到，总有一天他们会受到审判。 这一天已经为期不远了。	We are thus slowly reaching the point where some of those contemplating crimes such as those committed by Slobodan Milosevic must recognize that one day they could be held accountable.
首任特首董建华于2003年面对50万人的抗议；2005年，在第二任任期过半的时候，对他不断增长的民众不满迫使他辞职。	The first, Tung Chee-hwa, faced a half-million protesters in 2003; in 2005, halfway through his second term, his ever-growing unpopularity drove him to resign.
由电力系统本身的特点所引发的主要暴力危险是由对日益脆弱的电力输配网络发起的真实或虚拟攻击所导致的严重停电事故。	The main risk of violence created by the nature of the electricity system itself is the danger of serious power outages due to physical or cyber-attacks on the increasingly fragile transmission and distribution grid.
如果美国出口持平，即没有增长，且其他条件保持不变（相当大胆的假设 ） ， 总体真实GDP将趋向1.4 % 。	Under a flat-line export scenario, with no rise in US exports, and if everything else remains the same (always a heroic assumption), overall real GDP growth would converge on that 1.4% bogey.
1999年，在艾略特联合工作四诉秘鲁共和国国民银行案（Elliot Associates, LP v. Banco de la Nacion and the Republic of Peru）中，第二巡回上诉法院裁决原告购买折价债务的意图是为了获得足额偿付，否则原告就会上诉。	In 1999, in Elliot Associates, LP v. Banco de la Nacion and the Republic of Peru, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the plaintiff’s intent in purchasing the discounted debt was to be paid in full or otherwise to sue.
建立巴勒斯坦国的第三个挑战是建立国家机构，也就是医院、机场、道路、法院、警察局、税务局以及政府档案。	The third challenge in establishing a Palestinian state is to create the institutions of statehood: hospitals, ports, airports, roads, courts, police stations, tax offices, and government archives.
制造业集团如现代、LG和三星已经演变成高效的全球巨头，但它们的增长却导致国内的高质量工作岗位日渐稀少。	Manufacturing conglomerates such as Hyundai, LG, and Samsung have morphed into highly productive global giants whose growth creates fewer high-quality jobs at home than before.
但也有许多人，比如诺贝尔经济学奖获得者安格斯·迪顿（Angus Deaton ） ， 对世界银行的整体表现提出了批评。	But many, such as the Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton, have criticized the World Bank’s overall performance.
即使失业率下降也无法大幅提振需求，因为其下降很可能主要系劳动力参与率下降所推动，美国经常发生这样的情况。	Not even a decline in unemployment would do much to boost demand, not least because such a shift could well be driven by falling labor-force participation, as has often been the case in the US.
二战后的几十年中，美国经济平均年增长率为3 % ， 但在过去十年，增长率从未连续三个季度超过3 % 。	The US economy grew at an average annual rate of 3% during the decades after World War II, but it has not had even three consecutive quarters of 3% growth during the past decade.
之后，各方重新回到谈判桌前，谈判的目标既包括实现半岛无核化，也包括建立半岛和平机制，以结束60多年前的朝鲜战争的停战状态。	Second, all parties involved return to the negotiating table, with the parallel goals of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and concluding a peace accord to replace the 60-year-old Korean War Armistice Agreement.
当前美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘说“这次危机不同 — — 这是一个深深植根于对主要金融机构破产的恐惧中的一个世纪发生一次或两次的危机”的时候，他可能是对的。	Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan may be right when he says: “This crisis is different – a once or twice a century event deeply rooted in fears of insolvency of major financial institutions.”
毕竟，这些战略 — — 它们是巴黎协定的一部分 — — 方面的进展将给渴望降低气候相关风险、抓住可再生能源、电动汽车和电池等领域的新机会的投资者释放强烈的信号。	After all, progress on such strategies – part of the Paris agreement – sends a strong signal to investors seeking to mitigate climate-related risks and take advantage of new opportunities in renewables, electric vehicles, and batteries.
穆斯林世界中出现了数十篇研究杰哈德战略的文本，其中在西方名气最大的当数《野性的管理 》 ， 究其原因只是因为这篇文章被译成英文并被公开发表。	Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies. The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public.
在这种情况下，地方当局是否应该承担其成本，或者是否应借助公私合作伙伴关系来利用向用户收取使用费的方式筹措项目资金？	In that case, should the local authority pick up the cost, or should projects be financed through public-private partnerships, with tolls charged to users?
根据欧洲央行行长德拉吉在杰克森霍尔（Jackson Hole）的最新讲话，欧洲央行也为欧元区准备了类似的计划。	It now appears – based on European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s recent Jackson Hole speech – that the ECB has a similar plan in store for the eurozone.
通过投资和传播创新技术、增强市场联系、鼓励远见卓识的领导并将目标定位在最需要帮助（童儿也是最有潜力）的群体，我们就能养活全世界。	By investing in and spreading innovative technologies, strengthening market linkages, encouraging visionary leadership, and targeting those most in need – and thus with the most potential – we can feed the world.
大规模地区性自由贸易协定正在成型，与此同时，欧盟也在继续释放明确的承诺信号，通过成熟的双边协定实现自由贸易。	As large-scale regional free-trade arrangements take shape, the EU continues to signal unequivocal commitment to free trade through sophisticated bilateral agreements.
类似地，国家宇航局的重要地球科学研究项目也会分流给其他政府机构 — — 并削减预算，让它们无以为继。	Similarly, NASA’s important earth-science initiatives may be shunted off to other government agencies – where they can be defunded and left to die.
赞同紧缩的论点纯粹只是一个主张，但它应该是一个可测量的主张，所以计量经济学家一直忙于证明政府支出越少，经济增长越快。	The pro-austerity argument is pure assertion, but it is meant to be a testable assertion, so econometricians have been busy trying to prove that the less the government spends, the faster the economy will grow.
双方都同意，在一个日渐相互依赖的世界中，国际合作是十分必要的，而分歧之处主要在于应该为此付出多大努力。	Both also agree on the need for international cooperation in an increasingly interdependent world, with differences mainly concerning how much effort to spend on it.
而另一边，在1982年的塞维利亚，法德之间充满戏剧性的半决赛在两国的外交关系和两国人民的关系上都没有引起政治涟漪。	At the opposite end of the spectrum, the dramatic semi-final between France and Germany in Seville in 1982 produced no political ripples, either for diplomatic relations between the two countries or for relations between the two peoples.
如果这个叙事正确，那么政策结论就很简单：逐出唯银行家马首是瞻的官员，对富人课税，并更加激进地进行收入再分配。	If this story is right, the policy conclusion is simple: throw out the rascals who did the bankers’ bidding, tax the rich, and redistribute income more aggressively.
而这个名字则源自于大气中每百万份之350的二氧化碳含量值，照全世界最杰出的气候科学家吉姆·汉森所说，如果我们要避免遭遇潜在大规模气候变化的话，那么大气中的二氧化碳含量就不能超出这个数。	The name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that, according to Jim Hansen, perhaps the world’s leading climate scientist, we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.
他的税收改革计划，特别是大大降低“传递性”企业所得最高税率的措施，意味着收入再分配进一步向富人倾斜。	His tax reform plan, and especially its much lower top rate for “pass-through” business income, implies significant further redistribution of income to the wealthy.
最重要的是，欧洲仅仅通过大手笔投资于关贸总协定及其后的世界贸易组织所打造的多边贸易体系就达到了这一成就。	Most important, Europe was able to achieve it only by investing heavily in a multilateral trade system through the GATT and then the World Trade Organization.
尽管一开始的薪酬很低（也许每个月只有100美元 ） ， 但经验和培训能让这些年轻工作者获得持续教育（如护理 ） 、 提升技能和更高的收入。	Though initial compensation is very modest (perhaps $100 per month), the experience and training can put these young workers on a path toward further education (such as nursing), rising skills, and higher incomes.
贸易赤字确实膨胀了，但威尼斯人没有因此付出任何代价，因为这些商品由威尼斯自己的货币计价，换取其他国家自由提供的商品。	Trade deficits do swell, but they cost Venice nothing, because they are denominated in Venice’s own currency, in exchange for which other countries freely provide goods.
我离开投票站的时候，我的外甥女玛莎（Masha，大学一年级新生）指出 ， “ 普京是我唯一认识的领导人 。 ”	As I was leaving for the polling station, my niece Masha, a first-year college student, pointed out, “Putin is the only leader I have ever known.”
此外，移民总是比非移民生更多的孩子，这一倾向让美国人口增长快于其他发达国家（比如欧洲国家和日本 ） 。	Moreover, immigrants’ tendency to have more children than non-immigrants do keeps the US population growing faster than in other developed countries (for example, in Europe or Japan).
这条途径可以通过民族主义、宗派主义和身份政治找到 — — 即基于文化价值和符号而不是面包和黄油利益的政治。	Such an alternative is provided by the politics of nationalism, sectarianism, and identity – a politics based on cultural values and symbolism rather than bread-and-butter interests.
不严格遵守治疗方法、临床医生不正确用药和药物相互作用或吸收障碍都可能导致细菌生长被部分抑制，产生具有耐药性的有机生物。	Poor adherence to the therapeutic regimen, improper prescribing by clinicians, and drug interactions or malabsorption can result in partial suppression of bacterial growth and the emergence of resistant organisms.
比如，2011年8月，来自加沙的一个圣战团体夺取了埃及在埃以边境上的一个哨所，杀死了八名以色列公民。	For example, in August 2011, a jihadi group from Gaza seized control of an Egyptian outpost on Israel’s border and killed eight Israeli civilians.
在那种情况下，领导层会利用某种共同身份来动员追随者 — — 如中东地区现代冲突中这种共同身份是宗教、而非洲许多冲突的共同身份则是种族。	In that case, leaders will appeal to a common identity – for example, religion in the case of contemporary conflicts in the Middle East, or ethnicity in many African conflicts – to mobilize followers.
巴勒斯坦在基础建国问题上的一无所成导致目前几乎不可能与以色列进行任何有意义的和平谈判 — — 更不要说签订协议了。	The Palestinians’ basic failure at nation-building makes any meaningful peace talks with Israel – let alone an agreement – almost impossible at the moment.
因此他们不问喜欢什么工作，只想什么工作能让他们能够偿还学生贷款 — — 常常需要20年甚至更长时间才能偿清。	So they do not ask what job they would like; they simply ask what job will enable them to pay their college loans, which often will burden them for 20 years or more.
否则，我们永远无法实现哥伦比亚人民的伟大梦想：实现与哥伦比亚革命武装力量 — — 这支拉丁美洲历史最悠久也最庞大的游击队伍 — — 的和平。	Otherwise, we could never achieve the great dream of the Colombian people: peace with the FARC, Latin America’s oldest and largest guerrilla army.
去年，兰德公司（Rand Corporation）估计，光是保护朝鲜的核武器就需要270,000军队。	Last year, the Rand Corporation estimated that as many as 270,000 troops would be needed just to secure the North’s nuclear weapons.
美联储和其他央行现在都在非正式地探索这一选项，因为这可以将均衡利率提高到5—6 % ， 并降低在新的衰退中触及零下限的风险。	The Fed and other central banks are informally exploring this option now, because it could increase the equilibrium interest rate to 5-6%, and reduce the risk of hitting the zero lower bound in another recession.
中国领导人必须不惜一切代价确保这一减速不被视为长期趋势 — — 否则，经济所急需的消费和投资可能遭到破坏。	China’s leaders must do what it takes to ensure that such a slowdown is not viewed as secular trend – a perception that could undermine the consumption and investment that the economy so badly needs.
虽然政治联盟或许可以稳定欧元，但除非欧洲领导人们能够解决这一重大缺陷，否则就无法维持和加强民主制度。	While political union may stabilize the euro, it will not sustain or strengthen democracy unless Europe’s leaders address this critical failing.
最重要的是，它们应该形成一个指导性目标日期 — — 五年到15年不等 — — 以实现所有这些最初目标。	Most important, they should agree on indicative target dates – from five to 15 years – for achieving all of these initial objectives.
世行确实为各国的各种项目提供贷款，也为这些国家渡过危机提供帮助（如在1997-1998年间，为韩国提供了100亿美元的贷款 ） 。	It does lend money to countries to undertake a variety of projects, and to help them through crises (such as the $10 billion it provided to Korea in 1997-1998).
他们一直在忙于说服金氏政权收敛气焰，接受“大谈判 ” ： 正式承认和正常化其与所有邻国以及美国的关系，以此作为其去核化的交换条件。	They have been struggling to persuade the Kim regime to temper its volatility and accept a “grand bargain”: official recognition and normalization of relations with all of its neighbors, and with the United States, in exchange for denuclearization.
因此，日本视李明博近期的行为 — — 要求日本对战争进行道歉，对被迫做慰安妇的朝鲜妇女进行经济补偿，以及要求日本承认韩国对日本海洋面各岛屿的所有权 — — 为一种背叛。	As a result, the Japanese view his recent demands for apologies, money, and recognition of Korean sovereignty over the islands in the Sea of Japan as a kind of betrayal.
即使没有美国，JCPOA的剩余缔约国也能够支持伊朗温和派领导人减轻新制裁的效果，以此挽救JCPOA的核心目标。	Even without the US, the JCPOA’s remaining signatories can salvage the agreement’s central tenets by supporting Iran’s moderate leaders in mitigating the effects of new sanctions.
当长篇大论的多德-法兰克法案还在试图确保银行家们不再把美国纳税人置于危险中时，公众的注意力早就转移到了实体经济和就业之上。	Even as the United States’ voluminous Dodd-Frank bill tried to ensure that bankers never subjected American taxpayers to undue risk again, public attention had moved on to the state of the real economy and unemployment.
不仅如此，美国曾经要求苏联尊重门罗主义，而门罗主义在规定拉美是美国势力范围的同时，却不愿接受苏联在东欧地区的霸权。	Moreover, the US had demanded that the Soviet Union respect the Monroe Doctrine, which assigned Latin America to America’s sphere of interest, but was unwilling to accept Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe.
东部地区的反对派已经对那些卡扎菲支持者们实施了报复 — — 大部分被清算者都曾任职于令人谈之色变的利比亚安全机构“革命委员会 ” 。	Already, Libyan rebels in the east have exacted revenge on Qaddafi loyalists, many of whom worked for his feared revolutionary committees.
他拿出下面的图表来说明问题：该图标显示希腊商业信心在2015年春崩溃，直到我从财政部长任上辞职后才开始反弹。	To illustrate, he posted the diagram below, showing how business confidence collapsed in Greece during the late spring of 2015, and picked up again only after my resignation from the finance ministry.
但是，他的前任皮亚斯十一世在教皇 Mit Brennender Sorge （ “ 随着燃烧的关怀 ” ） 的通告中已经这样做了。	But his predecessor Pope Pius XI had already done that, in the Encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge (“With Burning Concern”).
考虑到特朗普进口关税升级和中国、欧盟和其他国家所采取的报复性措施，如果全球贸易萎靡趋势持续下去也不足为奇。	Given the worrying escalation of Trump’s import tariffs and the retaliatory measures being pursued by China, the European Union, and others, one should not be surprised if the weakening of global trade persists.
那些保证通过拒绝“欧洲 ” 、 反抗“伊斯兰化”以及驱逐移民来恢复国家主权的民粹主义者正好利用了这一不信任感。	And populists who promise to restore national sovereignty by rejecting “Europe,” fighting “Islamization,” and kicking out immigrants are exploiting this distrust.
同时，委员会公布了一份关于土耳其的国家发展报告，承认在总理雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安带领的伊斯兰温和派政府的领导下，土耳其的各项改革正在进行中，虽然步伐比较缓慢。	Meanwhile, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey that granted that reforms were continuing, albeit at a slower pace, under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s mildly Islamic-minded government.
平均名义GDP增长率与长期平均利率之间的差额可以用来估算一个国家金融抑制的程度，差额越大表示抑制越严重。	The degree of financial repression in a country can be estimated by calculating the gap between the average nominal GDP growth rate and the average long-term interest rate, with a larger gap indicating more severe repression.
针对国际足联的不当行为指控从国际足联执行委员会委员的假球和贿赂到卡塔尔为何被选为2022年世界杯的主办国。	Allegations of wrongdoing range from match-fixing and bribery among members of FIFA’s Executive Committee to questions about how Qatar was chosen to host the World Cup in 2022.
她觉得自己生病已经有两个月左右，来到诊所后，她描述自己出现了体重减轻、疲倦、气短、发热、夜间盗汗、冷战、食欲不振、呼吸和咳嗽时伴有疼痛等症状。	She had been feeling sick for about two months, and when she went to a health clinic, she described symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, shortness of breath, fever, night sweats, chills, loss of appetite, and pain when breathing and coughing.
立宪大会主席内姆邦（Subash Chandra Nembang）试图以自己的方式解决这一问题，他制作了有争议的宪法草案的调查表。 如果宪法草案采用，将在事实上引入多数程序。	Constituent Assembly Chairman Subash Chandra Nembang has attempted to resolve the problem his own way, preparing questionnaires on disputed constitutional issues that, if used, would effectively institute a majority process.
更加可以肯定的是，只要社区里出现武装反对派，就会招来空袭，摧毁民用基础设施，让没能逃脱的居民丧命或致残。	What is more certain is that the presence of armed fighters in a neighborhood provokes aerial attacks that destroy civilian infrastructure and maim and kill those residents who have not fled.
西方苦口婆心地宣传必须建立一个统一的、民主选举的政府，但考虑到利比亚社会和政治的严重分裂状态，这一宣传听起来完全与利比亚不相干。	Pious Western sermons about the need to form a unified, democratically elected government sound utterly irrelevant, given the extent of social and political fragmentation.
土耳其好像收到了欧盟委员会的最后通牒，那就是在一个月内向来自塞浦路斯的船只开放港口，否则，就有暂停目前正在进行的入盟谈判的危险。	Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission: open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month, or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway.
为此，英国医药与健康产品管理委员会(MHRA)第一次公布了一份调查摘要，申明此决定是在评估了所有案例的功效性和安全性数据之后作出的，无论这些数据曾经被公布与否。	For the first time, the MHRA made public a summary of the review that this decision was based on, including both efficacy and safety data for all of the trials, regardless of whether they had previously been published or not.
在年内接受墨西哥杂志《Proceso》采访时，规模庞大的锡那罗亚卡特尔的二号人物伊斯梅尔•尚巴达明确指出 ： “ 毒品问题涉及成百上千万人口。	Interviewed by the Mexican magazine Proceso this year, the second-in-command of the giant Sinaloa cartel, Ismael Zambada, made the point clearly: “The narco problem involves millions of people.
球队管理者没能将从原本一个点的优势中继续发展出多点优势，而是陷入了“积极的惯性 ” — —很想有所建树，但却依然死守既定的路径，即使该路径已经遇到了根本性的挑战。	Rather than diversify from a position of strength, managers became stuck in “active inertia” – trying to do more, but still locked into their established approach, even as it came up against fundamental challenges.
正如最近发布的美国《国家安全战略报告》所指出的那样 ， “ 在印度洋-太平洋地区存在着自由和压迫性这两个世界秩序愿景之间的地缘政治竞争 。 ”	As the most recent US National Security Strategy report put it, “A geopolitical competition between free and repressive visions of world order is taking place in the Indo-Pacific region.”
事实亦然：货币政策显然只是为家庭、金融部门和主权部门赢得时间修复资产负债表，为强化增长的政策赢得起效时间。	And, in fact, it wasn’t: monetary policy was explicitly intended to buy time for households, the financial sector, and sovereigns to repair their balance sheets and for growth-enhancing policies to kick in.
这个法庭—以几乎不可能的方式集结了柬埔寨本国和外国的法官、律师及适用法律—旨在这个国家长久以来法律惩戒形同虚设的国家成为司法改革和司法独立的样板。	The court – with its improbable blend of Cambodian and foreign judges and attorneys as well as laws – is meant to be a model for judicial reform and independent justice in a country where impunity has long been the rule.
但是，统一的欧洲政策不能仅仅局限于地缘政治方面，因为如果是这样的话，共同利益就不足以强大到推翻国家利益的程度。	Yet, the unified European policy must not be purely geopolitical, because if it were, the common interest would not be strong enough to override national interests.
但这无非意味着我们幸运地生活在现在，而不是一个世纪前（当然，比生活在两个世纪前或生活在中世纪就更加幸运了 ） 。	But that just means that we are lucky to be living now rather than a century ago (and even luckier to be living now than two centuries ago or in the middle ages).
当传统市场机制失灵时 ， “ 可转移的市场排他性”等工具可以起到帮助作用。 这一机制允许制药公司将某种抗生素的知识产权转移到另一种药品身上。	When traditional market mechanisms fail, instruments such as “transferable market exclusivities” can help, by allowing drug makers to transfer an antimicrobial medicine’s intellectual-property benefits to another drug.
事实上，中国国家主席习近平所实施的转型日程受到新加坡模式的巨大影响 — — 不懈的反腐斗争、大范围打击异见人士，以及市场经济改革。	Indeed, Chinese President Xi Jinping is pursuing a transformative agenda heavily influenced by the Singapore model – a relentless war on corruption, a broad crackdown on dissent, and pro-market economic reforms.
但当前周期似乎不可能导致类似的过度投机行为并以类似的爆破收场，因为欧元区外围国家的增长模式已经发生了很大变化。	But it seems unlikely that the current cycle will lead to similar excesses and end in a similar bust, because the growth pattern in the peripheral eurozone countries has changed considerably.
由于美国社会的深刻分裂，特朗普孤立、反自由主义的政府可能已经缺乏推迟、更不要说逆转全球力量向中国大规模转移的政治资本和决心。	Owing to the deep divisions within American society, Trump’s isolationist, anti-liberal administration may already lack the political capital and determination to delay, let alone reverse, the momentous shift in global power toward China.
世界经济论坛创始人克劳斯·施瓦布（Klaus Schwab）指出，2015年可能是“人类命运之年 ” 。	According to WEF founder Klaus Schwab, 2015 can be a “year of destiny for humankind.”
20世纪90年代前，阿尔巴尼亚被称为欧洲的朝鲜，后来阿尔巴尼亚放弃了对自给自足的狂热追求，开始为意大利制造商缝衣裁鞋，并逐步有了自己的 完全整合的公司。	Known as the North Korea of Europe until the early 1990s, when Albania abandoned its quixotic quest for autarky, it started cutting and sowing garments and shoes for Italian manufacturers, gradually evolving its own fully integrated companies.
波多黎各所需要的不仅仅只有短期援助（尽管这也颇为紧急 ） ； 还需要两党共同支持它重建，其中，首要的重点是建立更稳定、更廉价的电力供应。	Puerto Rico needs more than short-term assistance (although this is also urgent); it needs bipartisan support to rebuild, with an initial and essential focus on a more robust and cheaper supply of electricity.
这样做不容易，更需要花费时间，但总比让机会不平等性高到十分危险的程度或让一大部分人口需要依赖转移支付过活强。	This will not be easy or quick, but it beats having corrosively high levels of inequality of opportunity, as well as a large segment of the population dependent on transfers.
蔡英文以56.1%的得票率赢得大选表明尽管许多台湾人希望与中国建立良好关系，但他们反对北京一再宣称的“一个中国”政策。	Tsai’s election, with 56.1% of the vote, demonstrates that, while many Taiwanese want good relations with China, they are opposed to the “One China” policy repeatedly asserted in Beijing.
第一个问题是具体因素 — — 不管是真实因素还是人们所认为的因素 — — 导致一些选项无法进入调整候选清单。	The first problem arises when specific factors, real or perceived, block some options from the adjustment menu.
他们并没有承诺给出一整套急需的强化措施，而是沉溺于徒劳地寻求“大杀器”来一次性解决美���的所有经济问题。	Rather than committing to a comprehensive set of urgently-needed reinforcing measures, they seem obsessed with the futile search for the one “killer app” that will solve all of the country's economic problems.
“在发达经济体，所有情景 ， ” 麦肯锡写道 ， “ 都表明到2030年将实现充分就业，但转型可能包括失业率高企和[趋于下降的]工资调整时期 ， ” 这取决于适应的速度。	“In advanced economies, all scenarios,” McKinsey writes, “result in full employment by 2030, but transition may include periods of higher unemployment and [downward] wage adjustments,” depending on the speed of adaptation.
如果世界银行不将IDA资金的12%用于印度，就有足够的资源投资于非洲 — — 即使捐赠规模保持不变。	If the World Bank did not send 12 cents out of every dollar of IDA funding to India, it would have ample resources to invest in Africa – even if donations remained flat.
共产党的领导层因为它在国际社会越来越高的地位而变得更加自信，但是它是否能跟上国内所发生的变化的步伐也变得更加不确定了。	The Party leadership has grown more self-assured in its growing international role, but its ability to manage the pace of change at home has become more uncertain.
英格兰银行的安德鲁·哈尔丹（Andrew Haldane）和动物学家罗伯特·梅（Robert May）的一篇论文指出，衍生品就像是病毒。	As a paper by Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England and the zoologist Robert May points out, derivatives were like viruses.
各国政府（虽然目前焦点都集中在希腊和意大利身上，但它们并不是孤例）对过多的人许下了过多也过久的承诺。	Governments (the focus is on Greece and Italy at the moment, but they are not alone) have promised too much, to too many, for too long.
如今，世界民主国家所面临的任务是继续现代性工程，领会地球极限的最新知识，同时拖动广泛的民主参与、减少贫困和社会不公。	The task that the world’s democracies face today is to continue the project of modernity, embracing the latest knowledge about planetary boundaries, while advancing broad democratic participation and reducing poverty and social injustice.
这样就能够充分发挥美军向世界各地快速派遣军队的能力，同时也使这种做法更为灵活、更符合当今的政治潮流。	This will capitalize on the US military’s ability to project force around the world quickly, while providing a more flexible and politically palatable way of doing so.
并非所有的银行都是自愿买入受困国政府债券的 — — 一些是迫于监管者压力，一些是迫于政府要求 — — 但确实有很多银行做出了不明智的投资决策。	Not all banks voluntarily loaded up on distressed government bonds – some were pressured by supervisors, others by governments – but many have made unwise bets.
毕竟，完全分离意味着存在于给定银行集团别处的资源无法被用于解决因为住房和商业地产价格下跌而导致的零售银行危机。	After all, full separation implies that resources from elsewhere in a given banking group are unavailable to address a retail-banking crisis resulting from, say, a slump in residential and commercial property prices.
对于出于正当理由而并不支持恐怖份子激进主张的各国政府和个人而言，表示反美并不提供保护或者让他们能够幸免。	Expressions of anti-Americanism will provide no protection or immunity to governments or individuals who for good reason are not prepared to endorse the terrorists’ radical agendas.
遗传学和生物学在人类的领导人中起作用，但是它们不是以传统的英雄战士的领导方法显示的方式来起决定作用。	Genetics and biology matter in human leadership, but they do not determine it in the way that the traditional heroic warrior approach to leadership suggests.
但与此同时，虽然发表了充满良好意愿的声明以及相对明确的姿态，中国的新领导层仍未订立一个切实明确，足以解决当前经济中存在的深层次问题的改革计划。	But, despite well-intentioned statements and narrow gestures, China’s new leadership has yet to establish a concrete, bold reform plan capable of resolving the economy’s deep-rooted problems.
用交通打比方，几乎没有负面溢出效应的政策可以给予“绿灯 ” ； 应该临时使用的政策应该给予“黄灯 ” ； 不论何时都应该避免的政策应该给予“红灯 ” 。	To use a traffic analogy, policies with few adverse spillovers should be rated “green”; those that should be used temporarily could be rated “orange”; and policies that should be avoided at all times would be “red.”
没人能质疑现代物理学所取得的预测性成就，但人们也必须牢记：当一个人在解释自然的时候，他其实不一定懂得自然。	One can hardly challenge the predictive success of modern physics, but one should remember that one is describing nature, and not always understanding it.
在中东，只有伊朗和黎巴嫩真主党支持叙利亚总统巴沙尔的政权，而叙利亚内战已处于不可挽回的边缘，黎巴嫩和约旦也极有可能因此受到动摇。	In the Middle East, only Iran and Hezbollah support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in a civil war that is nearing the point of no return and destabilizing Lebanon and Jordan.
法国总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德已经要求美国总统奥巴马介入此事以减少罚款额，欧盟内部市场及服务专员米歇尔·巴尼埃（Michel Barnier）也提出了同样的请求。	French President François Hollande asked US President Barack Obama to intervene to have the fine reduced, as did the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market and services, Michel Barnier.
如果中国采取干预措施使人民币贬值，美国对反华贸易行动的政治支持毫无疑问会有所加紧，让世界前两大经济体朝着保护主义越走越近。	If China intervenes to push its currency lower, US political support for anti-China trade actions will undoubtedly intensify, pushing the world's two largest economies closer to the slippery slope of protectionism.
如果国家预计会经历自然风险，比如破坏性暴风季或大地震，那么投资时间和资源用于为冲击做好准备就能够拯救生命、保护社会免受其他损失。	If countries expect to experience natural hazards, such as violent storm seasons or major earthquakes, then investing time and resources in preparing for shocks will save lives and protect communities from other losses.
而比哈尔邦的首席部长尼替什·库玛尔就通过启动认真改革，仅仅5年时间就在这个曾经以腐败和无能闻名的穷邦做出了成绩。	And, to be fair, Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, a poor state that previously was a byword for corruption and incompetence, has shown what can be done by beginning a serious transformation of his state in just five years.
在西欧和美国，建于1950年代和60年代战后重建和经济繁荣期间的桥梁，道路和铁路如今都已老旧，过时和过度使用。	In Western Europe and the United States, bridges, roads, and railways built in the 1950s and 1960s during the post-war reconstruction and economic boom are now old, obsolete, and overused.
失业年轻人在阿尔及利亚南部的石油业中心举行示威，认为高失业与军方控制阿尔及利亚自然资源之间存在直接联系。	Demonstrations by unemployed young people in southern Algeria, the center of the oil industry, drew a direct link between high unemployment and the military’s control of the country’s natural resources.
而直到事发后第五天，内贾德才发布了一份反驳美国指控的声明 — — 其中表达的立场还不如哈梅内伊强硬。	Only after five days did Ahmadinejad issue a statement denying the accusations – and not as strongly as did Khamenei.
对欧元危机的模糊而被动的反应反映了一种妥协，传统政党为了在代际差异日益极端时保有权力而做出了这一妥协。	The muddled, reactive response to the euro crisis reflects the compromises that traditional political parties have made in order to remain in power as generational differences have become increasingly extreme.
该协议还要求到2023年，40~45%的汽车产量必须来自平均工资超过每小时16美元的工人，这远高于墨西哥的工资水平。	It also requires that by 2023, 40-45% of production come from workers who are paid an average of more than $16 per hour, well above Mexican wage levels.
在更早的年代里，当原罪被比以现在更严肃的态度来看待的时候，动物遭遇的不幸对擅于思考的基督徒来说是一个非常困难的问题。	In earlier times, when original sin was taken more seriously than it generally is today, the suffering of animals posed a particularly difficult problem for thoughtful Christians.
要想达成能够确保伊朗继续去核化、让其弹道导弹计划接受检查，并鼓励其减少外交政策中的敌意的新协议，制裁和颠覆政权都不能作为选项。	In order to reach a new deal that ensures Iran’s continued denuclearization, puts its ballistic missile program under surveillance, and encourages a less hostile foreign policy, both sanctions and regime change must be taken off the table.
问题在于，在决定是否要这么做的时候，特朗普和中国国家主席习近平的首要乃至唯一关注点有可能是国家利益和个人政治考虑。	The problem is that, in deciding whether to do so, Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, will probably focus primarily, if not exclusively, on national interests and personal political calculations.
事实上，美国两名学者 — — 坎普顿（Willett Kempton）和巴蒂沙克（Cory Budischak ） — —的最新研究表明，到2030年，可再生能源和氢能相结合的储藏就能以与今天相当的成本全面承担起大型电网的供电任务。	Indeed, the bottom line of a new study by two American researchers, Willett Kempton and Cory Budischak, is that the combination of renewables and hydrogen storage could fully power a large electricity grid by 2030 at costs comparable to those today.
埃尔多安政府最近残忍地镇压了反对伊斯坦布尔Taksim Gezi公园改建计划的群众游行，这让土耳其看起来像是一党独裁。	The Erdoğan government’s recent brutal crackdown on popular protests against planned construction in Istanbul’s Taksim Gezi Park made Turkey look like a one-party dictatorship.
其中一小部分或许可以救活，但根本现实是，这是改变二战后全球经济面貌的多边贸易谈判史上一次独一无二的失败。	While a small portion of the project may be saved, the essential reality is that this is a unique failure in the history of multilateral trade negotiations, which have transformed the global economy since World War II.
因此，如果OMT制度在当前条约框架下不可行，则条约必须修改 — — 毕竟条约是人定的，而不是天定的。	So, if the OMT scheme is not feasible under current treaty provisions, these provisions – which, after all, are of human, not divine, origin – must be amended.
（当然对于所有国家整体而言保护主义就是一场灾难；一国的支出转移被其他国家自身转移所抵消的程度要更大。 ）	(Of course, for all countries taken together, protectionism spelled disaster; one country’s expenditure shift was more than offset by others’ own shifts.)
巴黎—2001年，法国提出一项议案，建议联合国安理会五大常规任理事国 （ “ 五常 ” ） 自愿在群众暴行（mass-atrocity）犯罪问题上克制使用否决权。	PARIS – Back in 2001, France floated a proposal that the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (P5) should voluntarily refrain from using their veto power when dealing with mass-atrocity crimes.
美国的内部财政困局和外部的种种麻烦事，再加上中国经济地位的提升，令许多人在去年不禁想象是否会出现某种中美两国共同统治世界的景象。	America’s financial difficulties and foreign entanglements, together with China’s economic ascent, led many last year to envisage the emergence of a sort of global condominium between the two countries.
在过去三十年中，大规模高质量劳动力队伍所带来的明显好处帮助亚洲成为了全球供应链的枢纽 — — 并以此不断向发达经济体的收入和生活水平靠拢。	Over the last three decades, significant gains in workforce size and quality helped Asia to become a hub of global supply chains – and thus to sustain rapid progress toward advanced-economy income levels and living standards.
太多的人感到被边缘化，被遗忘，被剥夺 — — 对放任这些情况发生的领导人和机构充满了愤怒 — — 国内政策压力也随之日益加剧，导致各国不得不向内转。	With too many people feeling marginalized, forgotten, and dispossessed – and angry at the leaders and institutions that have allowed this to happen – domestic policy pressure has intensified, causing countries to turn inward.
根据经济学家托马斯·皮凯蒂（Thomas Piketty）的研究，收入不平等的高点通常会伴随一场严重的危机。	According to research by the economist Thomas Piketty, a spike in income inequality is often followed by a great crisis.
但是我们无法单靠我们自己去实现这一目标，更无法通过与那些在他们有关一个稳定与和平的中东的概念中并没有以色列的位置的人谈判去实现这一目标。	But we cannot reach that goal alone, much less negotiate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful Middle East is one that has no place for Israel.
但是他接着又指出了他自己的不同意见。 他说 ： “ 时间已经过了将近三十年，我们已经不再是一只绵羊，而美国也已经不再是以前的豺狼了 ” 。	But the official went on to add his own twist, “Nearly 30 years have passed, and we are not that lamb anymore, and maybe the US is not the same wolf it once was.”
2011年5月，哥伦比亚大学的贾格迪什·巴格瓦提（Jagdish Bhagwati）和我共同主持了由英国、德国、土耳其和印尼首相/总理组成高级别小组，试图推动多边程序的进步。	In May 2011, Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University and I co-chaired a High Level Group convened by the prime ministers of the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, and Indonesia to attempt to move the multilateral process ahead.
例如在越南，如果考虑到该国规模庞大的非正规经济领域，面临威胁的工作岗位比例从国际劳工组织预测的70%下降到仅15 % 。	In Vietnam, for example, the share of jobs at risk falls from the ILO’s predicted 70% to just 15% when the country’s large informal economy is taken into account.
还有，因为欧洲的收益很高，那么为了保证物价稳定而有可能会在将来提高的实际利率只会带来更大的收益而不会引起经济的震荡。	Moreover, because profits are high in Europe, likely future increases in real interest rates needed to ensure price stability easily can be financed out of profits without economic disruption.
马里、中非共和国、南苏丹和索马里等一些非洲国家都被卷入无休无止的内战，民众连饮水都有困难，更不要说享受学校、医院和其他社会基础设施了。	Several African countries – Mali, Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Somalia – are engulfed in permanent civil war, leaving citizens without potable water, much less schools, hospitals, and other social infrastructure.
对此普林斯顿大学的安格斯·迪顿教授在他精心研究撰写的新书《大逃亡：健康，财富，以及不平等的本原》中提出了警告。	In his eloquently written and deeply researched new book The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality, Princeton University’s Angus Deaton urges caution.
唯一两例总统弹劾的先例（包括1868年弹劾安德鲁·约翰逊滥用权力，以及1998年弹劾比尔·克林顿作伪证和妨碍司法）其结果均不尽如人意：这两者最终都被参议院无罪开释。	The only two presidential precedents (Andrew Johnson, impeached in 1868 for abuse of power, and Bill Clinton, impeached in 1998 for perjury and obstruction of justice) are hardly encouraging: both ended in acquittal by the Senate.
也许假以时日，以主之名扼杀一幅漫画的野蛮屠夫终究会发现，他们无法阻止我们，每一次尝试都只能让我们更加坚定（原文如此 ） 。 ”	Maybe with time, the murderous savages that kill for a drawing in the name of their god, will get it through their thick heads that they can never stop us, and every attempt to only fuels our cause more (sic).”
尽管伯南克的表态让市场关注“逐渐减少”将于何时开始以及将以何种速度实行，但这些决定不会影响未来一两年已经上升的利率水平。	Although Bernanke’s announcement has focused markets on exactly when this “tapering” will begin and how rapidly it will proceed, these decisions will not affect the increased level of rates a year or two from now.
尽管朝鲜的共产主义制度已经与中国有着本质的不同，但仍有些中国人担心朝鲜秩序崩溃可能会改变这场辩论的走向。	And, while North Korea’s communist system and that of China have become profoundly dissimilar, some Chinese worry that a collapse of North Korea’s order could shift the battle lines of that debate.
阿拉法特逝世后几小时，阿巴斯就被推举为巴解组织执委会总书记，牢牢获得该组织的支持。 巴解组织代表了全巴勒斯坦人，包括那些在外散居的犹太人。	By being voted chairman of the PLO’s executive committee hours after the death of Yasser Arafat, Abbas clinched the support of the organization that represents all Palestinians, including those in the diaspora.
不平等性的加剧正在让收入向高储蓄倾向人群（富人和公司）转移，而资本密集型、劳动力节约型技术创新加强了这一趋势。	Rising inequality is redistributing income to those with a high propensity to save (the rich and corporations), and is exacerbated by capital-intensive, labor-saving technological innovation.
这种旅游所赚取的收入可以帮助该国建立自己的卫生体系，确保所有印度人 — — 包括贫困人口，特别是营养不良的儿童 — — 都能获得优质的医疗保健服务。	The income earned from such tourism could help the country to shore up its own health system, ensuring that all Indians – including the poor and especially children, among whom malnourishment remains rampant – have access to quality health care.
例如，借出少量资金或注销债务来帮助极端贫困人口意在帮助最弱势群体，而这两种方法似乎都具有完全合理性。	For example, lending small amounts of money or writing off debts to help the extreme poor are intended to help the most vulnerable, and both approaches seem entirely sensible.
塞内加尔的首位总统列奥波尔多·赛达尔·桑戈尔坚定地信奉白人至上，他曾经写道“白人的代名词是理智，而黑人的代名词是感情 。 ”	Senegal’s first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, was a strong believer in white supremacy who once wrote that “reason is Helennic; emotion is Negro.”
当我们要将自己的栗子从火中取出来的时候，求助于国际货币基金组织或者其他人，不会为我们带来欧洲一体化中所需的信心。	Turning to the International Monetary Fund or others when it comes to pulling our chestnuts out of the fire will not bring us the needed confidence in the European project.
可是到1992年，过度捕捞却使曾经高产的捕鱼业被彻底关闭，而且尽管采取了种种措施，但纽芬兰大浅滩却再也未能恢复到从前的盛况。	By 1992, however, over-fishing had forced the total closure of this once highly productive fishery, and, despite all efforts, Newfoundland’s Grand Banks has never recovered.
身为非法毒品主要生产国和消费国的西非国家政府应该为预防、治疗和减少伤害机制提供资金，而不仅仅是投资于缉毒和执法。	Governments in those West African countries that are the principal producers and consumers of illegal drugs should fund prevention, treatment, and harm-reduction initiatives, rather than only investing in interdiction and law enforcement.
在税率提高、税收负担向最高收入群体转移的背景下，国会以收入中性的方式降低最高税率、扩大税基不足为奇。	Against this background of rising tax rates and a shift in the tax burden to those with the highest income levels, it would not be surprising if Congress reduced the top tax rates and broadened the tax base in a revenue-neutral way.
像银行一样，所有这些金融机构都面临着流动性或资金周转的风险，如果它们的债权人无法周转它们的短期贷款额度，它们就会垮掉。	Like banks, all these financial institutions are subject to liquidity or rollover risk – the risk of going belly up if their creditors do not rollover their short-term credit lines.
非洲拥有富于创造力的大量劳动力资源，其背后起支撑作用的是到2050年有望翻番至8.3亿以上的青年人口。	Africa boasts a large and creative labor pool, buttressed by a youth population that is expected to double, to over 830 million, by 2050.
覆盖这些成本需要私人部门参与或共同投资于项目之中，通过同时代表政府负责项目管理的融资工具（financial vehicle）实现。	Recovering these costs would require participating in the project or co-investing with the private sector through some financial vehicle that also manages the project on behalf of the government.
墨西哥的杀人案发率仍将居高不下，公安机关仍将对导致国家边缘化的绝大多数暴力案件的预防、侦破或惩罚束手无策。	The homicide rate in the country will continue to soar, and public security agencies will remain incapable of preventing, detecting, or punishing the vast majority of violent events that have placed the country on edge.
神经科学 — — 关于大脑，即那个人类脑袋内部的器官，如何工作的科学 — — 正在改变我们关于人类如何决策的看法。	Neuroscience – the science of how the brain, that physical organ inside one’s head, really works – is beginning to change the way we think about how people make decisions.
换言之，政府应当在需救助事件发生之前就制定好一套救助政策，而不是当金融机构遇到麻烦的时候才临时做出某种决定。	In other words, governments should establish bailout policies before the need to intervene arises, rather than make ad hoc decisions when financial firms get into trouble.
填补这一差距要求我们认识到，我们生活在一个新型的创新驱动的经济中，新的全球规范、标准、政策和惯例都必须捍卫公共信任。	Closing that divide requires us to recognize that we are living in a new type of innovation-driven economy, and that new global norms, standards, policies, and conventions are needed to safeguard the public trust.
当然，没有公司能这样做，但是许多美国公司已经在大量剥离工人和中层经理 — — 2008年1月份的数字比去年同期增加了19 % 。	Of course, no company can do that, but many US companies have been shedding workers and middle managers in great numbers – the figures for January 2008 were up 19% from a year earlier.
相反，与（在当前经济状态下）需要什么或合理均衡状态所能产生的自由市场、弹性价格经济相比，利率太高而通胀太低。	On the contrary, compared to what is needed (given the current state of the economy) or to what a free-market, flexible-price economy in proper equilibrium would deliver, interest rates are too high and inflation is too low.
你可以同时是一个骄傲的瑞典人，又是一个骄傲的欧洲人；你可以既是德国人，也是土耳其人，并从这种双重性中获取优势。	One can be a proud Swede and a proud European at the same time; one can also be both German and Turkish, and derive strength from that duality.
再加上管理松散、人满为患、清洁环境恶劣的庞大的城市贫民窟 — — 上述国家一直拼命试图遏制疫情因此也就不足为怪。	Add to that sprawling urban slums – semi-governed, overcrowded, and poorly sanitized – and it is not surprising that these countries have struggled to contain the epidemic.
也可以从另一个角度看待苹果问题：如果苹果继续成功，它难道不能从它的巨星产品中 — — 如iPad、iPhone和MacBook — — 获得创新所需要的现金吗？	Here is another way of looking at the Apple problem: If Apple continues to succeed, won’t it generate the cash that it needs for innovation from its super-products, like the iPad, the iPhone, and the MacBook?
工业化国家长期以来产生大量的排放和其他类型污染，同时以自身发展的名义消耗绝大多数世界资源 — — 包括世界水资源的90 % 。	The industrialized countries have long produced massive amounts of emissions and other kinds of pollution, while consuming a huge share of the world’s resources – including 90% of the world’s water – all in the name of their own development.
日本，特别是像我这样的日本政治领袖，有责任保证我们的教训在全球核电站的安全建设规则和标准中有所体现。	It is Japan’s responsibility, particularly of political leaders like me, to ensure that our experiences are reflected in the creation of safe building codes and standards for such plants worldwide.
结果，他们可用来消除生产率增长障碍、构建结构更合理的经济以应对迅速的科技进步和全球经济环境变化的能力雪上加霜。	As a result, they have even less capacity to dedicate to removing impediments to productivity growth and building a more agile economy capable of responding to rapid technological advances and changes in the global economic environment.
事实上，如今环境是中国的一个热点话题，纪录片《穹顶之下》即时明证。 该片以批判的角度讲述了空气污染和中国煤炭和石化公司在其中所起的“作用 ” 。	Indeed, the environment is a hot topic in China today, exemplified by the response to the documentary film “Under the Dome,” which takes a critical look at air pollution and the role of the country’s coal and petrochemical companies.
但假如能反映出全世界最活跃的经济体已经出现期待已久的结构性改革的话，较为缓慢的GDP增长对中国来说就是件好事。	But slower GDP growth is actually good for China, provided that it reflects the long-awaited structural transformation of the world’s most dynamic economy.
不论我们是否愿意，也不论我们是否做好了准备，这些科技发展会使我们逐渐成为全球生态系统的管理者而不仅仅是参与者。	Like it or not, ready or not, these scientific developments are putting us on the road to becoming the managers of the global ecosystem, rather than just a participant in it.
当然，如果希腊的债权人接受债务减免，国际货币基金组织的贷款将变得更加安全 — — 利益冲突也会因此减少。	Of course, if Greece’s creditors accept a haircut, the IMF’s credits would become more secure – hence the conflict of interest.
因为现在的金融危机已经使许多西方资产变得很便宜，它们现在处在俄罗斯政府和主要俄罗斯公司伸手可及的范围之内。	As today’s financial crisis has made many Western assets cheap, they are now within reach of Russia’s government and leading Russian companies.
2月20日，当人民向基辅的武装部队发起自杀式袭击时，他们代表“国家”的感觉压倒了他们对个体死亡的担心。	When civilians launched a suicidal attack on an armed force in Kyiv on February 20, their sense of representing “the nation” far outweighed their concern with their individual mortality.
但是，当一些著名的活动家警告气候变化即将带来的灾难时，我们看到的更真实的情景是这些城市应对这些变化的能力。	But, while celebrity activists warn about the impending doom posed by climate change, a more realistic view is offered by these cities’ ability to cope.
第三，近几个季度，英国经济增长相当缓慢，大刀阔斧的财政瘦身政策生不逢时，上扬的通胀令英格兰银行不敢出台宽松的货币政策来加以配合。	Third, economic growth has been flat on average in the UK over the last couple of quarters, with front-loaded fiscal austerity coming at a time when rising inflation is preventing the Bank of England from easing monetary policy.
Moins de 2 % du PIB de l’Union européenne est consacré à la recherche, comparé à 2,5 % aux États-Unis et à 3 % au Japon.	Less than 2% of the European Union’s GDP is devoted to research, compared to 2.5% in the US and 3% in Japan.
在印度和印度尼西亚，莫迪和维多多分别当选总理和总统让人们寄希望于他们为如今看起来步履蹒跚经济改革带来新活力。	In India and Indonesia, hopes that the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joko Widodo, respectively, would spark a new wave of economic reform now seem to be running into the sand.
诚然，启蒙时代苏格兰的伟大思想家 — — 如大卫·休谟、亚当·斯密乃至于国民诗人罗伯特·彭斯（Robert Burns ） — —无不是“英国性”的强烈支持者，不管今天这可能意味着什么。	True, Scotland’s great minds in the age of Enlightenment, such as David Hume, Adam Smith, and even the national poet, Robert Burns, were all fervent advocates of “Britishness,” whatever that might mean today.
政府希望，这样的信息可以稳定市场，以便“有毒”资产的价格可以上涨到银行家在卖掉它们时可以感觉不太为难的水平。	This message, it was hoped, would stabilize the market so that prices for “toxic” assets could rise to a level at which bankers might feel comfortable selling them.
而暗示元首对犹太人的仇恨让他与渴望建立自己的国家以逃避暴力反犹主义的犹太人站在同一边绝对是一种冒犯甚至更糟糕的说法。	And the implication that the Führer’s hatred of the Jews put him on the same side as Jews who wished to build their own state to escape from violent anti-Semitism is offensive, to say the least.
两位作者居然都粗心地忽略了某些数据，使用了有问题的加权方法，并采用了错误的观察方法来评定GDP增长。	The authors had inadvertently omitted data, used a questionable weighting scheme, and employed an erroneous observation on GDP growth.
日积月累之下，MedRewards, Contagion Health， HealthRally以及其他公司会用数据来证明自己的价值。	Over time, MedRewards, Contagion Health, HealthRally, and others will have to prove their worth with data.
在2012年7月，法国和阿尔及利亚将举办庆祝阿尔及利亚共和国成立50周年的庆典，而这场庆典恰好是在法国总统大选结束之后进行。	In July 2012, France and Algeria will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the birth of the Algerian Republic.
只用了短短一年时间，卢旺达就报告93%以上的少女接种了人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）疫苗 — — HPV病毒是宫颈癌最主要的致病元凶。	After just one year, Rwanda reported vaccinating more than 93% of its adolescent girls against the human papillomavirus (HPV) – by far the largest cause of cervical cancer.
今天西方自由民主国家都想拼命避免一场身份危机，但结果却使这场危机愈演愈烈，最终威胁到当前的社会契约，并有可能毁灭现有的社会秩序。	Liberal democracies in the West today are struggling to avoid – and in doing so are exacerbating – a crisis of identity, which puts the existing social contract at risk and threatens their implosion.
事实上，直到1994—1995年比索危机爆发，世界才发现墨西哥私有银行通过表外借贷（衍生品）承担了巨大的货币风险。	Indeed, it was not until after the eruption of the 1994-1995 peso crisis that the world learned that Mexico’s private banks had taken on a significant amount of currency risk through off-balance-sheet borrowing (derivatives).
查哥伦比亚大学的尔斯·卡罗米里斯（Charles Calomiris）提出了他所谓的“财政程序的真正破坏”质疑 — — 资金的来源和去向都不透明。	Charles Calomiris of Columbia University has challenged what he calls “a real subversion of the fiscal process” as funds are raised and spent in non-transparent ways.
和方济各一样，全球各大主要宗教的宗教领袖敦促我们从信仰和气候科学中汲取智慧，以旅行我们对人类和对地球未来的道德责任。	Like Francis, religious leaders of all the world’s major religions are urging us to take wisdom from faith and climate science in order to fulfill our moral responsibilities to humanity and to the future of Earth.
那么，其他国家 — — 从欧洲大亚洲 — — 是否应该欢迎美国和中国事实达成的“负优先贸易协定”呢？	So, should other countries – from Europe to Asia – welcome the “negative preferential trade agreement” according to which the US and China are effectively operating?
朝鲜在1984年正式开始对外国投资者开放，当时朝鲜政府看到了中国在这方面的成功，并颁布了类似的《外国合资企业法 》 。	Officially, North Korea began opening up to foreign investors in 1984, when the government enacted the Foreign Joint Venture Law, following the success of a similar law in China.
但这一不可持续的扩张需要外国借款支持，通货膨胀率也高攀至15%以上，经常项目赤字超过GDP的5 % 。	But this unsustainable expansion was financed by foreign borrowing, and the inflation rate has since skyrocketed to over 15%, with the current-account deficit exceeding 5% of GDP.
1989-1993及2002-2006年间，随着发展中国家加大劳动密集型产品的生产及出口，他们的经常账户盈余平均增长了近3.6 % 。	As developing countries increased their labor-intensive production and exports, their current-account surpluses rose – by almost 3.6 percentage points, on average, between 1989-1993 and 2002-2006.
他们的土地权利受《民事和政治权利国际公约 》 （ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights）保护，而德国是签约国之一。	They found no remedy, in either Uganda or Germany, for the violation of rights that, according to the Committee, they possess under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Germany is a signatory.
其军队没有能力在干预沙特阿拉伯防务的同时既维持国内安全，又时刻准备着对付印度（巴基斯坦将军们执着不放的敌人 ） 。	Its military lacks the capacity to intervene in Saudi Arabia’s defense while maintaining not only domestic security, but also readiness for war against India (an obsession of Pakistani generals).
世界可能没在迈向冷战，而是在迈向由四方力量领导的国际体系，美国、中国、俄罗斯和德国主导各自的地区，并在国际谈判中争夺上风。	Rather than a cold war, the world may be heading toward an international system led by four powers, with the US, China, Russia, and Germany dominating their respective regions and seeking the upper hand in international negotiations.
其互联网审查的诸多要素 — — 从屏蔽政治敏感的维基百科文章到过滤在线搜索关键词 — — 一起构成了所谓的防火长城。	Its many elements of Internet censorship – from blocking politically sensitive Wikipedia articles to filtering certain key words out of online searches – come together to form the so-called Great Firewall of China.
私有化的拥护者们宣称他们相信市场，但是他们却提议使用可以移走账面损失的预算伎俩，似乎市场可以就这样被容易地愚弄。	Advocates of privatization claim to believe in markets, but they are proposing budget gimmickry that would move those losses off the books, as if markets could be easily fooled.
在1994年9月，执政基督教民主联盟的两位议员发表了一份对欧洲的政治声明，对欧洲的未来，尤其是大欧洲联邦的前景提出了自己的想法。	In September 1994, two MPs from the majority Christian Democratic Union published a political statement on Europe, questioning its future, particularly the prospect of federalism.
战争结束5年后的1950年，德国战后首任总理康拉德·阿登纳同样提议成立财政联盟（这次是法德财政联盟 ） — —借以摆脱战败国的生存危机。	In 1950, five years after the war, Germany’s first postwar chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, also proposed a union – this time between France and Germany – as a way out of his defeated country’s existential crisis.
不过大多数住在非洲城市里的人都有办法在农村弄到土地，这就是为什么利比里亚政府如此肯定地强调农业的拓展潜力。	Nevertheless, most people living in Africa’s cities have access to land in the countryside, which is why Liberia’s government rightly highlights the potential for farm expansion.
习近平说，在根本层面 ， “ 亚洲的事情要靠亚洲人民来办，亚洲的问题要靠亚洲人民来处理，亚洲的安全要靠亚洲人民来维护 。 ”	According to Xi, at the fundamental level, “it is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the problems of Asia, and uphold the security of Asia.”
更意味深长的是，随着美国最近发布有关台湾问题的讲话，美国和日本准备使用联合军事力量阻止、遏制并最终阻挠中国可能在台湾海峡发动的军事行动。	More significantly, with the latest statement over Taiwan, the US and Japan are poised to use their joint military forces to deter, deny, and ultimately defeat potential Chinese military actions across the Taiwan Strait.
但因为工资水平世界最高且19%的GDP来源于制造业（美国的相关数据为12 % 、 英国只有10 % ） ，瑞士本应在理论上面对中国竞争和破坏工作机会的自动化挑战时更加难以抵抗。	But with wage levels among the world’s highest and 19% of its GDP coming from manufacturing (compared with 12% in the US and 10% in the UK), it should, in theory, be highly vulnerable to Chinese competition and job-destroying automation.
这是实施量化宽松计划如火如荼的面联储所面临的问题，其每个月都买长期资产的操作驱使渴望收益的投资者涌入这些国家，造成它们的货币升值、资产价格上涨。	That was the question faced by the Federal Reserve at the height of its quantitative-easing program, when its monthly purchases of long-term assets drove yield-hungry investors into these countries, causing their currencies and asset prices to rise.
虽然CAFTA代表着该地区寻求扩大美国市场准入的过程中的一个重要机会，但新规则究竟是会加强还是会削弱中美洲生产者的实力现在还是个未知数。	Although CAFTA represents an important opportunity in the region's quest to expand its access to the US market, it is unclear whether the new rules will strengthen or weaken Central American producers.
在7月8日的预算公告中，英国财政大臣奥斯本（George Osborne）提出要在未来四年削减120英镑福利支出，作为其削减赤字计划的一部分。	In his July 8 budget announcement, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne proposed to cut £12 billion ($18.6 billion) from the welfare bill over the next four years as part of his deficit-cutting plan.
得益于较高的收入水平，美国在适应气候变化挑战方面处于比印度和中国这类低收入国家更好的地位，更别提那些低收入的非洲国家了。	With its high income, the US is in a far better position to adapt to the challenges of climate change than poor countries like India and China, let alone a low-income country in Africa.
这一歧视在基于信息的社会中正开始被打破，但把我们在信息时代所需要的新的领导风格简单地归为“女性世界”是不对的。	This bias is beginning to break down in information-based societies, but it is a mistake to identify the new type of leadership we need in an information age simply as “a woman’s world.”
这一实验室曾经在沃森的领导下成为世界顶尖的生物科学研究和教育机构。 洛克菲勒大学也取消了沃森原定的一场讲座。	This was not, he claimed, what he meant, and more importantly, “there is no scientific basis for such a belief.”
12月，梅输掉了第一场重要的退欧战役，工党议员联合12位保守党叛徒通过了一份修正案，要求一切与欧盟谈成的协议都需要国会法案批准。	In December, May lost her first important Brexit battle, when Labour MPs united with 12 Tory rebels to pass an amendment requiring a specific Act of Parliament to approve whatever deal is negotiated with the EU.
在最近的总统竞选中，在高投票率的推动下，奎萨达凭借60%多的支持率赢得胜利，而他的反对者准备限制同性恋婚姻，这是哥斯达黎加长期以来坚持人权政策的倒退。	In the recent presidential election, a large turnout carried Carlos Alvarado Quesada to victory with more than 60% of the vote, against an opponent who would have rolled back longstanding commitments to human rights by restricting gay marriage.
然而，尽管这些技术已经存在，但要想取得成功，还需要推广免耕农业，采用永续栽种原则，加强湿地管理，使用轮牧技术等。	But while the techniques already exist, success will require increasing the use of no-till farming, adopting permaculture principles, better managing wetlands, and using rotational grazing techniques, among other measures.
而国际货币基金组织正在保护的新兴市场国家央行行长们也在传达一个同样强烈的信息：赶紧决定吧；不确定性快要害死我们啦！	And yet central bankers in the very emerging markets that the IMF is supposedly protecting have been sending an equally forceful message: Get on with it; the uncertainty is killing us.
其中值得注意的一点是，僵尸企业和僵尸银行之间的邪恶勾当堵塞了实体经济的动脉 — — 导致生产率增长大幅放缓，至今都未扭转这一状况。	Significantly, the insidious interplay between zombie corporates and zombie banks clogged the arteries of the real economy – sparking a sharp slowdown in productivity growth that Japan has yet to reverse.
贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁非常受欢迎的原因是因为大家知道他珍惜言论自由，认真对待批评他的人的意见，并捍卫他们和他持不同意见的权利。	Jawaharlal Nehru was hugely popular because he was known to cherish free speech, take seriously the views of his critics, and defend their right to disagree with him.
俄罗斯电视评论员把支持欧洲导向的乌克兰的瑞典以及已经被纳入瑞典轨道的波兰和立陶宛称为想为波尔塔瓦战役复仇。	Russian television commentators describe the countries most engaged in supporting a European-oriented Ukraine – Sweden, along with Poland and Lithuania, which had been brought into the Swedish orbit – as seeking revenge for Poltava.
为了抵消高油价的负面作用，石油进口国采取了扩张性的经济政策，降低利率并增加政府支出，使得经济能在高油价下继续增长。	To combat the effect of high oil prices, consuming countries adopt expansionary economic policies, lowering interest rates and increasing government spending. This enables continued economic growth with high oil prices.
在演讲的“不设限问答”缓解，奥哈尼安没有接受关于Pizzagate 、 “ The_Donald”和仇恨言论的问题。	During an “Ask Me Anything” session after his speech, Ohanian took no questions about Pizzagate, “The_Donald,” or hate speech.
而我所属的记者保护委员会也通过发布年度全球犯罪不受惩罚指数来支持这一努力，该指数显示出墨西哥、巴西、印度，巴基斯坦和菲律宾等民主国家一直都未能对杀害记者的人定罪。	My organization supports this effort with our yearly Global Impunity Index, which shows that democracies like Mexico, Brazil, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines consistently fail to convict journalists’ killers.
但在偏远农村社区，我们所研究的方案更稳定、更方便、更有效，不断对沙蝇如此，对其他携带疾病的昆虫，如携带寨卡病毒的蚊子也是如此。	But in isolated rural communities, the solutions that we are researching may be more robust, convenient, and effective against not just sandflies, but also other kinds of disease-carrying insects, such as Zika-infected mosquitos.
只有调低工资、适应全新国际环境的需要，德国工人才能重拾竞争力，国内的就业水平才能回升，人力资源也才能得到充分的利用。	Only if wages adjust downward to accommodate the new international environment can German workers become competitive again, so that the country returns to a higher employment level, exploiting its human capital up to the capacity constraint.
事实上，尽管在20世纪90年代，建立货币联盟是否值得追求便已值得商榷，但现在解散欧元区会触发整个欧洲的深刻的经济、社会和政治剧变 。 。	Indeed, while the desirability of establishing a monetary union may have been open to question in the 1990’s, dismantling the eurozone now would trigger profound economic, social, and political upheaval throughout Europe.
然而克里姆林宫似乎隐隐约约地看到了一道烟幕，掩盖了欧盟的真实意图，尽管欧盟和俄罗斯最近的高峰会议提供了澄清事实的机会。	The Kremlin, however, seems to see in such vagueness a smokescreen hiding the Union’s true intentions, though the recent EU-Russia summit provided an opportunity to clear the air.
很难想象美国驻联合国大使萨曼莎·鲍尔（Samantha Power，她在人权保护方面记录优异）一心游说为以色列洗白。	It is difficult to imagine that US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, who has a fine record on human-rights protection, had her heart in lobbying to whitewash Israel.
忽略目前对可能不计后果行为的市场处罚或为后代着想的制度杠杆，就必定要承担巨大的风险，或许不是今天或明天，但总有一天，你的余生会为此受到威胁。	Omit either a market penalty now for behavior that may become reckless or the institutional levers that give a voice to future generations, and you run grave risks – perhaps not today or tomorrow, but someday, and for the rest of your life.
毫无疑问，长于数据管理和高级分析的员工供不应求，新出现的“译员 ” （ translator，即疏通IT和数据、分析和商业决策关系的人才）群体亦然。	To be sure, workers skilled in data management and advanced analytics are in short supply, as are members of an emerging class of “translators” – those whose talents bridge IT and data, analytics, and business decision-making.
因为缺乏民族认同感 — — 黎巴嫩已经分不清韧性和希望 — — 因为黎巴嫩在某种程度上像伊拉克一样受困于严重的社会分歧，以及软弱且臭名昭著的国家机构。	Lebanon’s resilience has confounded expectations, given its lack of a shared national identity – a result of deep social divisions that resemble, to some extent, those besetting Iraq – and notoriously weak state institutions.
他没有赋予反对他的美国多数民众任何改变意愿的理由，他也没有向支持者咨询持久政策、而非转瞬即逝的立法胜利需要采取哪些举措。	He has not given the majority of Americans who oppose him any reason to change their minds, nor has he counseled his base on the need for durable policies rather than evanescent legislative victories.
在这方面，政府投资的丹麦气候投资基金与大型丹麦养老基金联手，可以在惠及丹麦企业的气候项目上成为别国仿效的典范。	In this, the Danish Climate Investment Fund, through which the government invests, together with large Danish pension funds, in climate projects for the benefit of Danish companies, could serve as an example for others.
1949年，整个世界迅速分裂为东西两大政治军事集团，与这两大集团并存的还有声势浩大的“不结盟运动 ” 。	In 1949, the world was rapidly dividing into two principle political-military blocs, East and West, alongside a large “non-aligned movement.”
Notre expérience actuelle nous enseigne que les dirigeants des universités ne doivent pas accueillir le nombre croissant d’étudiants en se contentant d’augmenter leurs activités de base.	Our experience so far has taught us that university managers should not accommodate rising student populations by inflating their core business.
至少对于概论性质的大课，为何不让学生自己去观看由全世界最好的教授和讲师录制的课程，就像我们在音乐、体育和娱乐等领域所做的那样？	At least for large-scale introductory courses, why not let students everywhere watch highly produced recordings by the world’s best professors and lecturers, much as we do with music, sports, and entertainment?
因此，跨国经营的俄罗斯寡头和企业 — — 比如与特朗普组织打过交道的那些 — — 都是俄罗斯外交政策的可用棋子。	Russian oligarchs and companies operating internationally – such as those that have interacted with The Trump Organization – are thus potential instruments of Russian foreign policy.
但艾琳·阿贝尔鲍姆（Eileen Appelbaum）和罗斯玛丽·巴特（Rosemary Batt）新书《私募股权揭秘 》 （ Private Equity at Work）详细解释了一小撮人如何通过巧妙的债务战略一夜暴富。	But a new book, Private Equity at Work, by Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt, explains exactly how a few people have become immensely rich through the shrewd strategic use of debt.
确实，新兴市场和富含石油的国家的储蓄率自二十世纪七十年代以来是上升的，但是它被发达国家下降的储蓄率抵消了。	True, savings rates in emerging markets and oil-rich countries have been increasing since 1970, and especially in the last few years, but this has been offset by declining saving rates in advanced countries.
在中国，申请专利的热潮有时被认为是为了维护普通中国人的面子，因为这些人在中国政府大肆吹嘘本土技术的情况下反对购买国外技术。	In China, the rush to apply for patents is sometimes said to be about saving face with ordinary Chinese, who might well object to buying technology from abroad when China’s government so often lauds homegrown technology.
如果以后这个妇女想要一个孩子，为什么她使用她的较早的堕胎掉的胎儿的DNA，而不去通过通常的方式怀上另一个胎儿呢？	If, at a later date, the woman wants to have a child, why should she use the DNA of her earlier, aborted fetus rather than conceiving another fetus in the usual way?
现在，滞胀冲击可能源自以色列对伊朗核设施的袭击。 在以色列对伊朗的意图发出强烈警告的时候，这个地区的地缘政治危机在最近几个星期加剧了。	Today, a stagflationary shock may result from an Israeli attack against Iran’s nuclear facilities. This geopolitical risk mounted in recent weeks as Israel has grown alarmed about Iran’s intentions.
我们也有充分的理由相信中国新的领导人现在下定决心要使其经济从不断增加（而且不稳定）债务中解脱出来 — — 尤其是在其快速扩张的“影子银行”系统。	There is good reason to believe that China’s new leaders are now determined to wean the economy off ever-mounting (and destabilizing) debt – especially in its rapidly expanding “shadow banking” system.
"例如弗吉尼亚的人权活动家们就报道说在两间 ""超大""监狱的犯人就被戴上头套并遭受了""监狱管理人员过度和恶意的暴力 "" ， 通常包括电击装置和橡皮子弹。"	"In Virginia, for instance, human rights advocates report that inmates at two ""supermax"" prisons have been hooded and subjected to ""excessive and malicious use of force by prison staff,"" often involving electric shock devices and rubber bullets."
最后一个关键指标是每月公布的德国Ifo商业气候指数，它是体现欧洲整体情况的有用的周期性数据，因为德国欧洲经济当之无愧的核心。	The last key indicator is the monthly Ifo Business Climate Index in Germany, which contains useful cyclical data for Europe overall, owing to Germany’s centrality in the continent’s economy.
但欧元区的基础制度 — — 货币政策集中，但预算和经济政策仍有各国政府自行决定 — — 从长期看是不可行的。	But the eurozone’s architecture – in which monetary policy is centralized, but budgetary and economic policies are left up to individual governments – is not viable in the long term.
这个被称为“正式部门参与 ” （ official sector involvement，OSI）的项目包括数项旨在让希腊债务/GDP比率在2020年降至124%的计划，如今这一比例大约为200 % 。	Referred to as “official sector involvement” (OSI), it includes several initiatives aimed at reducing Greece’s debt/GDP ratio to 124% in 2020, from roughly 200% today.
关键在于，将大胆的想法与切实可行、功效卓著的技术联系起来，然后将想法和技术通过大规模公民行动推向前进。	The key is to link a bold idea with a practical and powerful technology, and then to push the idea and technology forward through mass citizen action.
利比亚国家过渡委员会正在讨论由谁接手利比亚央行和LIA的资产。 这一决定非同小可，因为据估计，利比亚的石油产量在近几年内都不会回到战前水平。	The National Transitional Council is debating who should take over Libya’s Central Bank and the LIA’s assets – an especially important decision, given that oil production is not expected to return to pre-war levels for several years.
当“反紧缩”的民众显然相信有简单易行的周期性方法去解决困难的结构性问题时，评论家们被成为了政客的大棒，用以抨击所有可见的目标。	Commentators are consumed by politics, flailing away at any available target, while the “anti-austerity” masses apparently believe that there are easy cyclical solutions to tough structural problems.
维也纳－新自由主义的拥护者认为，国家不仅要像公司那样经营，而且应该尽可能地不干预经济；他们坚持认为，市场可以自己调节自己。	VIENNA – Apologists for neo-liberalism assume not only that states should be run like companies, but also that, as far as possible, they should not intervene in the economy. The market, they insist, regulates itself.
全国1，600万人口中有超过70%每天依靠不到1.9美元生活，而肯尼亚的4，800万人口中仅有46%处在相同的境遇。	More than 70% of the country’s 16 million people live on less than $1.90 a day, compared to 46% of Kenya’s 48 million people.
哈梅内伊控制着伊朗的核计划和外交政策，但美国和以色列不但要在各自的政治制度内部形成一致，还必须在彼此之间消除分歧。	Khamenei controls Iran’s nuclear program and its foreign policy, but the US and Israel must work to reach consensus not only within their respective political systems, but also with each other.
在2005年三月的一次演讲中，Bernanke 说这一“过剩 ” ， 可以用来解释美国经济的几个特点，其中还可能包括巨大的财政和贸易赤字。	In a March 2005 speech, Bernanke argued that this “glut” helps explain several features of the American economy, possibly including the enormous fiscal and trade deficits.
具体而言，该报告建议以受保护资本和基础设施为标准，基于被保险和工程业通通采用的方法估算海岸生态系统的价值。	Specifically, the report recommends calculating the value of coastal ecosystems in terms of protected capital and infrastructure, based on approaches commonly used by the insurance and engineering industries.
最新的ABC新闻台 - 《 华盛顿邮报》民调显示，39%的美国人目前认为保护隐私比调查恐怖威胁更重要，而2002年只有18 % 。	A recent ABC News-Washington Post poll showed that 39% of Americans now say that protecting privacy is more important than investigating terrorist threats, up from only 18% in 2002.
但他可能因此触怒那些下岗工人并助长效率低下的权贵资本，而如果改革步伐太慢的话又无法满足那些投票反对（以及上街抗议）他的人。	But he risks angering laid-off workers and empowering inefficient crony capitalists, while moving too slowly to satisfy the desires of those who voted (and took to the streets to protest) against him.
有效市场假说 — — 认为平均而言金融市场对风险正确地进行了定价 — — 为20世纪八九十年代银行监管的大规模放松提供了理论基础。	The efficient-market hypothesis – the belief that financial markets price risks correctly on average – provided the intellectual argument for extensive deregulation of banking in the 1980s and 1990s.
默多克向来是澳大利亚碳定价的反对者，也是顽固的美国总统奥巴马的反对者，他大声赞美紧缩和最小监管的好处，抨击社会安全网的消极作用。	A fervent opponent of Australia’s carbon price, and a battle-hardened opponent of US President Barack Obama, Murdoch lauded the virtues of austerity and minimal regulation, and railed against the corrosive effects of social safety nets.
事实上，与其他东南亚独裁者一样，洪森现在似乎认为自己得到了全权政治委任，因为美国总统唐纳德·特朗普对人权问题的重视程度并不高。	In fact, Hun Sen, like other Southeast Asian autocrats, now seems to believe that he has political carte blanche, given the low priority that US President Donald Trump has placed on human rights.
这足以支付1.5万亿美元额外债务所带来的600亿美元利息支出，剩下的钱则用于增加政府支出或减少个人所得税。	That is enough to cover the $60 billion in interest payments on the $1.5 trillion of extra debt, with money left over to increase government spending or reduce personal taxes.
但是，当他5月7日宣誓就职时，他将重新统治这个国家，而这个国家的政治，甚至普京自己的政治前途，已经变得不可预知。	But, when he is sworn in on May 7, he will retake formal charge of a country whose politics – even Putin’s own political future – has turned unpredictable.
当然，在某个点上普京也许会选择孤注一掷，制造真正的大规模国际危机，也许还会引爆新形式的东西方直接战争，这种危险是存在的。	There is, of course, a danger that at some point Putin may choose to lash out and create a truly massive international crisis, and perhaps precipitate some new form of direct East-West warfare.
仅靠这两项措施 — — 两者都可以由政府监管机构颁布 — — 就可以减少近80%的抗生素用量，从而大大延缓抗生素耐药性的产生。	These two measures alone – both of which could be enacted by governmental regulatory agencies – would reduce the use of antibiotics by nearly 80%, slowing the rise of antibiotic resistance substantially.
相反，那次会议后，在吞并克里米亚期间被拘留的乌克兰电影人奥列格·肖斯托夫以目前被关押在俄罗斯的64名乌克兰政治犯的名义发起了绝食运动。	On the contrary, since the event, Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker detained during the annexation of Crimea, launched a hunger strike in the name of the 64 Ukrainian political prisoners currently held in Russia.
结果，政府忙不迭地讨好伊斯兰教徒，采取了禁止“伤害宗教情绪”的立法并据此干扰和逮捕无神论者和自由派。	As a result, the government has not hesitated to try to curry favor with the Islamists by using legislation that prohibits “hurting religious sentiments” to harass and arrest atheists and liberals.
此外，通过借助税收法案中的针对性条款来压榨包括加利福尼亚州和纽约州在内的“蓝色 ” （ 民主党主导）州，不仅进一步扩大了美国的政治分歧，而在经济学上也是败笔。	Moreover, squeezing the “blue” (Democratic) states, including California and New York, by including provisions in the tax bill aimed specifically at them, not only further widens America’s political divide; it’s also bad economics.
之所以危险，是因为实现目标所需要的政策可能会带来有害副作用；之所以是幻觉，是因为目前并没有理由应该追逐现在的目标。	It is dangerous because the policies needed to achieve the objective could have unwanted side effects; and it is a delusion because there is currently no good reason to be pursuing the objective in the first place.
皮诺切特将军将他和我们的家庭赶出了智利，我的少年时光和成人的早期阶段都在流亡中度过，我和其他来自智利、阿根廷、巴西和乌拉圭的流亡者具有共同的希望和恐惧。	General Augusto Pinochet kicked him and our family out of the country, and I spent my adolescence and early adulthood in exile, sharing hopes and fears with other expatriates from Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.
而其中一个最明显的系统性欺骗行为，就是许多中国官员都利用假冒或者循不正常途径取得的学历文凭来粉饰自己的简历。	One of the most obvious signs of systemic cheating is that many Chinese officials use fake or dubiously acquired academic credentials to burnish their resumes.
通过重新分配来自政界和企业窃贼及其法律和金融宗主的盗窃财产，反腐败运动不仅要让强权人物为自己的腐败行为负责。	By redistributing stolen assets from political and corporate thieves and their legal and financial enablers, anti-corruption campaigns do not just hold the powerful to account.
结果，欧洲一直在抱薪救火 — — 德国人一直在强推紧缩 — — 其结果是，短短三年后，欧元区财政危机演变成了一场欧洲存亡危机。	As a result, Europe continues to try to quench the fire with gasoline – German-enforced austerity – with the consequence that, in a mere three years, the eurozone’s financial crisis has become a European existential crisis.
应对贸易协定带来的经济、政治和人道主义问题的最佳办法是通过转移支付、临时性收入支持以及再培训，而不是维持保护主义壁垒。	The best way to deal with the economic, political, and humanitarian concerns raised by trade agreements is via transition rules, temporary income support, and retraining, as opposed to maintaining protectionist barriers.
事实上，由于中国 — — 与（比如）欧洲不同 — — 大部分银行贷款现在锁定在基础设施和其他实体资产中，因此刺激需求比去杠杆化更好。	Indeed, because most bank loans in China – unlike, say, in Europe – are now locked up in infrastructure and other physical assets, boosting demand is preferable to deleveraging.
私有企业的投资人应该表现得更加情愿地拿出钱凑足350亿美元，因为当金融资产价格在它们目前的价值与正常价值没有任何差异时，它们就能赚上一笔。	Private-sector investors ought to be more than willing to kick in that $35 billion, for they stand to make a fortune when financial asset prices close some of the gap between their current and normal values.
偏好投资于亚洲以外地区是亚洲主要高储蓄国家和地区，包括中国、香港、韩国、台湾所共有的特征，虽然亚洲的回报总体而言要高于其他地区。	This preference for investing outside Asia is shared by the region’s other major savers – namely, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore – even though returns within Asia are generally higher than elsewhere.
去年夏天总理雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安所在的公正和发展党的改选，紧接着阿卜杜拉·居尔当选为第一位妻子戴着头巾的总统，这好像都强化了反对伊斯兰的欧洲人的担心。	Last summer’s re-election of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s AKP, followed by the election of Abdullah Gul as the first president whose wife wears a headscarf, seemed to confirm the fears of anti-Islamic Europeans.
这些经济体经常项目盈余以及大量的资本流入让它们的货币财政机关试图防止其货币升值，以便维持其产业的竞争力。	These economies’ current-account surpluses, together with massive inflows of capital, have led their monetary authorities to try to prevent their national currencies from appreciating in order to maintain the competitiveness of their industries.
更重要的是，受过高等教育的移民实际对发达国家的公共财政作出了积极的贡献，因为这些劳动者所缴纳的税收超过了他们所使用的公共产品和服务。	More important, highly educated immigrants have actually contributed positively to public finances in developed countries, because these workers pay more in taxes than they use in public goods and services.
认为日本过去财政刺激无效 — — 唯一结果是将大量投资浪费在无用的基础设施上 — — 的批评家犯了两个错误。	Critics who argue that fiscal stimulus in Japan failed in the past – leading only to squandered investment in useless infrastructure – make two mistakes.
不管怎样，认为从几个世纪和无数国家收集来的所有这些证据对于现在和将来的状况已经失去任何意义了，如果不是太傲慢的话，是不是有点太早了呢？	After all, is it not premature – if not plainly arrogant- to claim that all this evidence collected over many centuries and across numerous countries has lost any meaning for the present and the future?
发自蒂拉纳 — — 由于委内瑞拉的人道主义灾难日益恶化，该地区及其他地区的政府都在思考如何应对，而或许也是时候让民间社会去创造一些新的行动方式了。	TIRANA – As Venezuela’s humanitarian catastrophe worsens by the day, governments in the region and beyond ponder how to respond. It may be time for civil society to invent new ways of taking action.
特朗普的财政部长史蒂文·莫尼辛（Steven Mnuchin）宣称因为技术对工人的取代“甚至不在[行政部门]的视野之内。	Trump’s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has declared that the possible technological displacement of workers is “not even on [the administration’s] radar screen.”
在行政机构中，为了鼓励、事实上是强制多方合作并避免独权专治带来的风险以及对独教掌权镇压的恐惧，部长理事会由基督教徒和穆斯林派的双方力量平衡组成。	In the executive branch, the council of ministers is balanced among Christians and Muslims in order to encourage, indeed force, cooperation and to avoid the risk of domination the fear of oppression by one group.
但是这些分化过去被犬儒主义方式操纵着。 斯洛布登‧米洛赛维齐和弗拉特科·杜子曼都在昔日的南斯拉夫国用同样的方法以使塞尔维亚、克罗地亚和波斯尼亚反目成仇。	But those divisions were manipulated with the same sort of cynicism that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman used to pit Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian against each other in the former Yugoslavia.
比如，在美国，最顶端的1%人口占收入的比例比20世纪70年代末翻了一番多，从年GDP的8%上升为目前的20%以上，上一次达到如此程度还是在20世纪20年代。	In the United States, for example, the income share of the top 1% of the population has more than doubled since the late 1970’s, from about 8% of annual GDP to more than 20% recently, a level not reached since the 1920’s.
美国参谋长联席会议主席邓普希（Martin Dempsey）承认，对于叙利亚局势，美国缺少明确的路线图。	Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, has admitted that the United States lacks a clear picture of the situation in Syria.
此外，监管边界问题依然存在：冒险行为可能被转移到监管较松的领域，形成影子银行系统，让问题死灰复燃 — — 这正是当前危机的写照。	And the regulatory boundary problem persists: risky activities may migrate to areas where regulation is lax and reproduce the problems with the shadow banking system that we have witnessed during the crisis.
随着抑郁状态的加重，病人除了感到极度的悲伤和无助，还会伴有丧失自信、内疚、失忆和精力难以集中等症状，导致他们陷入极度的痛苦之中。	As depression worsens, feelings of extreme sadness and hopelessness combine with low self-esteem, guilt, memory loss, and concentration difficulties to bring about a severely painful state of mind.
但尽管“假新闻”是一个非常真的问题的有用的标签，它并没有告诉我们，我们是否真的生活在一个“后真相 ” （ post-truth）的世界中；以及，如果答案是肯定的话，我们中谁必须为此负责。	But while “fake news” is a useful label for a very real problem, it does not tell us if we are in fact living in a “post-truth” world; and, if so, whom we should hold responsible.
但这个王国却依然无动于衷，犹豫于是否让遭到炸弹袭击而在利雅得就医的也门总统阿里·阿卜杜拉·萨利赫回国恢复统治。	But the Kingdom remains paralyzed, still wavering on whether to allow President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is convalescing in Riyadh from injuries sustained in a bomb attack, to return to Sana to resume his rule.
这些群体的态度更一般地映射出美国人民的态度：69%的天主教徒和62%的主流新教徒表示气候变化正在发生，福音派教徒对此表示同意的比例则为略占多数（51 % ） 。	These groups’ attitudes mirror those of Americans more generally: 69% of Catholics and 62% of mainline Protestants responded that climate change is happening, with a smaller majority of Evangelicals (51%) agreeing.
受到向低工资国家的资本流动、专业化、外包甚至移民的影响，整个富有世界国家中低技能劳工的平衡价格都已下降。	Prompted by capital flows to low-wage countries, specialization, outsourcing, and even immigration, the equilibrium price of unskilled labor has fallen throughout the western countries.
同样，一些移民怀疑论者或那些“焦虑中间派”人士可能会在极端观点主导的公开辩论中感到自己被错误代表或曲解了。	Similarly, some immigration skeptics, or those belonging to the “anxious middle,” may feel misrepresented or misinterpreted in a public debate dominated by extreme views.
我只希望美联储在未来18个月中将利息升高足够多，以避免长时间过度宽松货币政策可能导致的金融不稳定和长期通胀。	I only hope that it raises them enough over the next 18 months to avoid the financial instability and longer-term inflation that could result from the long era of excessively easy monetary policy.
但是，如果以色列迫使哈马斯接受其边境控制和正式停火的条件，哈马斯作为巴勒斯坦抵抗运动守护人的形象就会遭到严重的破坏。	But if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire, Hamas’s image as the guardian of Palestinian resistance will be severely damaged.
如果“巴基斯坦国的理念还不如巴基斯坦人的理念强烈 ” ， 正如著名作家阿克巴尔（M.J. Akba）写道，这个国家怎么能够进步呢？	How can it progress if, as the noted author M.J. Akbar wrote, “the idea of Pakistan is weaker than the Pakistani.”
反对者用危机之前的措辞称，金融交易税会降低市场的效率，导致交易到其他地方进行。 “这又怎么样呢 ？ ”	Defending his creation, Volcker harks back to a simpler time for the financial system, and refers to “overly liquid, speculation-prone securities markets.”
伦敦 — — Facebook网站上一个名叫“我们都是奥萨马·本·拉登”的组织称“他生为英雄，死为烈士…他们杀死一个奥萨马，一千个奥萨马会就此诞生 。 ”	LONDON – “He lived a hero, he died a martyr...if they killed one Osama, a thousand others will be born,” says a comment on a Facebook group called “We are all Osama bin Laden.”
尼哈拉尼领导下的审查委员会对于道德监督严格到什么程度呢？ 007系列电影《幽灵党》的吻戏被认为太长（因此被剪掉 ） 。	To get an idea of the scale of the Nihalani-led review board’s moral policing, a kiss in the James Bond movie Spectre was deemed too long (and therefore trimmed).
尽管叙利亚国民革命联盟（National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary）和反对军（Opposition Forces）获得了全世界的承认，但巴沙尔政权的无序倒台仍可能导致该国分裂为多个自治领地。	Notwithstanding the worldwide legitimacy now enjoyed by the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, a disorderly collapse of the regime might yet lead to the country’s division into autonomous ethnic enclaves.
重点在于穆斯林旅行禁令 — — 在这个角度，也包括墨西哥边境墙 — — 与明言的理由关系不大，而与未明言乃至无意识的考虑关系更大。	The point is that a travel ban on Muslims – or the Mexican border wall, for that matter – may be less related to their expressed justifications than to other, even unconscious considerations.
即便如此，无论是阿尔贝亲王、廷德尔还是台下那些受人景仰的听众都不可能预料到150年后这次实验的结果将在多大程度上主宰世界。	But neither he, nor Tyndall, nor anyone in their distinguished audience could possibly have anticipated the extent to which the experiments’ results would preoccupy the world 150 years later.
而塔利班得以卷土重来的其中一个关键因素则是因为他们找到了位于巴阿两国边境的庇护所，以及来自巴基斯坦国内一些组织源源不断的支持。	A critical factor in the Taliban’s revival was the haven that it found in the distant reaches of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and the support that it continued to receive from elements within Pakistan.
在2002—03学年，平均每28位小学生和18名中学生拥有一名教师；到2012—13学年，这一比率分别降至20人和16人。	In the 2002-03 school year, there were 28 students per teacher in primary education and 18 in secondary schools; by 2012-13, this had fallen to 20 and 16, respectively.
“考虑到核武器对全人类所造成的破坏 ， ” NPT开宗明义 ， “ 因此，绝对有必要竭尽全力避免核战争的危险，采取措施保护人类安全 。 ”	“Considering the devastation that would be visited upon all mankind by a nuclear war,” the NPT begins, there is a “consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of such a war and to take measures to safeguard the security of peoples.”
这两个问题比其他任何以色列威胁（这在很大程度上是虚构的 ） ， 对现有国家的威胁都要大得多，并且该地区的领导人很清楚这一点。	These two problems pose far greater dangers to the existing states than does any (largely fabricated) Israeli threat, and the region’s rulers know it.
事实上，美国总统奥巴马推动美国在宏观经济管理、金融监管、环境政策和医疗卫生等方面走向更大的政府积极主义。	Indeed, President Barack Obama moved the US toward greater government activism in macroeconomic management, financial regulation, environmental policy, and health care.
如果每个个人都像富人那样花大量的能量和资源用於避免公平税负，那么税收系统要么将崩溃，要么被更具侵略性和强制性的机制取代。	If every individual devoted as much energy and resources as the rich do to avoiding their fair share of taxes, the tax system either would collapse, or would have to be replaced by a far more intrusive and coercive scheme.
事实上，美国接受该地区的伊斯兰政党 — — 从突尼斯复兴运动到埃及穆斯林兄弟会 — — 这一事实表明对伊斯兰组织的怀疑正在消退。	Indeed, America’s acceptance of Islamist parties in the region, from Ennahda in Tunisia to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, suggests that skepticism of Islamist groups may be losing ground.
英国金融服务管理局已经使用相同的理由来要求外资银行建立当地子公司，而不是通过母公司下属的分公司来进行存款或贷款。	The UK’s Financial Services Authority has been invoking the same rationale for requiring foreign banks to establish local subsidiaries, rather than taking deposits or lending through a branch of the parent bank.
每人每年投资四美元就可以挽救11，000到36，000人的生命，并减轻对成百上千万人造成的负面健康影响。	An investment equivalent to $4 per person could save 11,000-36,000 lives annually and reduce adverse health effects for tens of millions of people.
去年，由于这些机构从他们冒险和激进的商业策略“挣来”的巨额利润，五大投行的雇员拿到的奖金累计超过了360亿美元。	Collectively, their employees shared more than $36 billion dollars in bonuses last year, thanks to the huge profits these institutions “earned” on their risky and aggressive business strategies.
具体到世界经济这样的复杂系统，了解过去 — — 如过去20年来几乎所有国家制造业就业人数的大幅下滑 — — 本身已经具有很大难度。	For a complex system such as the world economy, understanding the past – for example, the massive decline in manufacturing employment in almost all countries over the past two decades – is already hard enough.
但由于贷款人和借款人的利益分歧，清迈倡议从未付诸实施 — — 就连2008年全球金融危机达到顶峰时都从未实施过。	But, given the divergent interests of lenders and borrowers, it has never been used – not even in 2008, at the height of the global financial crisis.
贝索斯是今日永存基金会（我也是该基金会的董事成员）慷慨的捐助者，其个人还创办并且拥有一家叫蓝源（Blue Origin）的火箭公司（而我则是其竞争对手XCOR公司的董事 ） 。	This is a man who is a generous donor to the Long Now Foundation (I am on its board) and who personally founded and owns a rocket company, Blue Origin (I am on the board of a competing company called XCOR).
在这些例子中 — — 比如在推进贸易协定时 — — 躲在大同主义身后是凭借自身“硬”赢得政策战斗的拙劣替代品。	Hiding behind cosmopolitanism in such instances – when pushing for trade agreements, for example – is a poor substitute for winning policy battles on their merits.
后来他承认，谈判一直继续到2016年6月，特朗普 — — 自2015年6月加入总统竞选以来，他反复声明与俄罗斯没有生意往来 — — 赢得共和党提名为止。	He later admitted that the talks had continued until June of that year, after Trump, who had repeatedly stated since entering the race in June 2015 that he had no business with Russia, had sewn up the Republican nomination.
自危机以来，它们已经采取了不少重大改革步骤，但它们都仍在经历两位数的失业率和停滞不前的增长，并且，正如上一期国际货币基金组织《财政观察 》 （ Fiscal Monitor）所揭示的，它们都仍在为严重的债务问题焦头烂额。	All are still experiencing double-digit unemployment rates amid moribund growth, and, as the last International Monetary Fund Fiscal Monitor made abundantly clear, all still suffer from significant debt problems.
的确，在谢瓦尔德纳泽统治时期，稳定并不总是与民主相关。 谢瓦尔德纳泽是前苏联外长，在玫瑰革命中被赶下总统宝座。	To be sure, stability was not always identified with democracy during the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Union foreign minister who was ousted as our president by the Rose Revolution.
比如，在许多难民来源国，同性恋、双性恋、两性人和阴阳人（LGBTI）的健康问题仍然是一个禁忌，即使在医生中间也不例外。	For example, in many countries where refugees originate, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) health concerns remain taboo, even among medical professionals.
现今，石油是最重要和最有价值的国际贸易商品。 它对我们文明的重要性由于我们对其消耗殆尽的担忧而更加凸显。	Today, oil is the most important and valuable internationally traded commodity, and its significance to our civilization is underscored by the recurrent worry that we are running out of it.
这样也会导致民众不愿帮助弱势群体：有报道称见到地中海私人船只绕开遇险移民船，目的是避免受到欧洲边境巡逻部队的申斥。	It may also discourage people from helping the vulnerable: there are reports in the Mediterranean of private vessels avoiding migrant boats in distress for fear of being reprimanded by European border patrols.
大部分项目的投资规模宏大，因此国际上通行的项目融资方法会有很大的帮助 — — 基于预期现金流而不是出资者的资产负债表 — — 和有效的风险共担机制将起到很大的作用。	Given the scale of most investments, project finance – which is based on projected cash flows, rather than its sponsors’ balance sheets – will prove highly useful, as will effective risk-sharing mechanisms.
自20世纪90年代以来，中国决策者一直希望发展人民币在国际金融中的作用，从而增强中国的地缘政治地位。	Chinese policymakers have been hoping to develop the renminbi’s role in international finance, in order to strengthen China’s geopolitical standing, since the 1990s.
比如，怀俄明州选出了两位共和党参议员来代表近580,000人，而有着3,900万人的加利福尼亚州，选择了两位民主党参议员。	Wyoming, for example, elects two Republican senators to represent its nearly 580,000 residents, while California’s more than 39 million residents elect two Democratic senators.
该国橙色反对派运动最近在议会中赢得了关键职位，而且目前而言，它也在听取前联合国秘书长安南以及非洲联盟代表保持冷静的呼吁。	The country’s Orange opposition movement has recently won key posts in parliament and, for the moment, is heeding calls for calm from former United nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and representatives of the African Union.
西雅图—美国总统特朗普新公布的2018年预算蓝图提出要大幅削减美国对外援助，这引发了一场关于对外援助支出在改善全球最脆弱群体的健康和福利方面的作用的讨论。	SEATTLE – US President Donald Trump’s recently released 2018 budget blueprint proposes deep cuts in US foreign aid, prompting a discussion on the role of such spending in improving the health and wellbeing of the world’s most vulnerable people.
此外，我们的方法所带来的好处不仅仅是一目了然的定量结果，因为它集合了来自不同学科的科学家为同一个目标而努力。	Moreover, our approach had benefits beyond the immediate quantitative findings, because it united scientists from different disciplines around a shared goal.
但欧洲的构建逻辑要求法国来补充德国 — — 现在还需要其他主要欧盟国家的补充，包括意大利、西班牙、英国和波兰。	But the logic of how Europe was constructed requires that France complement Germany – and now that other major EU countries, including Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Poland, do so as well.
此类产业不匹配在衰退期间有所恶化，反映的是随工人在衰退和扩张部门之间的流动而产生劳动市场的波动；会随着经济的复苏而减弱。	Such industrial mismatches become larger during recessions, reflecting greater churn in the labor market as workers move between shrinking and expanding sectors; but they decline as the economy recovers.
但只要到非洲村庄里亲自走走，就不难发现问题更多地涉及在恶劣自然条件下人类的生存努力，而不是非洲所特有的所谓独特社会问题。	But a visit to Africa’s villages makes clear that the problems have more to do with the struggle for survival under difficult physical conditions than with any special problems that are unique to African societies.
这一合并的支持者们认为这将会提高俄国飞机产业的效率，而且，通过降低成本，可以让俄国飞机对外国买家更具有吸引力。	Proponents of the merger believe it will improve the efficiency of the Russian aircraft industry and, by lowering costs, make Russian planes more attractive to foreign buyers.
坎布里奇 — — 俄罗斯干预2016年美国总统大选，并被怀疑入侵法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙的竞选服务器不会令任何人感到吃惊，因为弗拉基米尔·普京总统理解（或者说误解）了软实力。	CAMBRIDGE – Russia’s interference in the 2016 US presidential election, and its suspected hacking of French President Emmanuel Macron’s campaign servers, should surprise no one, given President Vladimir Putin’s (mis)understanding of soft power.
如今，交易成本已经极低，上班工作的主要好处在于固定模式中的身体互动能激发组织文化和提升创造力，而不在于效率和生产率。	Now that transaction costs are so low, the primary benefit of working at work is that the physical interactions foster an organizational culture and boost creativity, rather than efficiency or productivity, within an established routine.
正如我们已经注意到的那样，在俄罗斯出现了对电视广播缺乏多样性的正当投诉，但是布什并没有对美国联邦通信委员会努力削弱媒体集中化法律作法提出反对。	There are, as we noted, justified complaints about the lack of diversity in television broadcasting in Russia, yet Bush has not opposed efforts by America’s Federal Communications Commission to weaken laws on media concentration.
但直到去年11月这个问题才得到广泛认可，当月联合国安理会轮值主席国赛内加尔主持召开了联合国有史以来首次有关水资源、和平与安全问题的正式辩论。	But it was not until last November that the issue gained widespread acknowledgement, with Senegal – that month’s UN Security Council president – holding the UN’s first-ever official debate on water, peace, and security.
此外，在这十年末期预算赤字上升 — — 以及随后国家负债暴涨 — — 的阴云也在压抑着投资和消费者支出。	Moreover, the cloud of rising budget deficits at the end of the decade – and exploding national debt after that – is also discouraging investment and consumer spending.
帕布给人留下最深印象的承诺问题也最大 — — 向市场贷款人筹措1400亿美元，但却没有明确铁路偿还贷款的方式。	Prabhu's most impressive promise – to raise $140 billion from market lenders – is also his most problematic, as he has failed to clarify how exactly the railways would repay the loans.
但用一颗原子弹在广岛杀死100，000人和用燃烧弹整晚对东京进行轰炸造成更多伤亡究竟有没有明确的道德区别？	But is there really a clear moral distinction between killing roughly 100,000 people in Hiroshima with one atom bomb and killing even more people in Tokyo in a single night of incendiary bombing?
这一威胁只是间接的；大部分下来人不愿意希腊退出，而瓦罗法基斯和总理齐普拉斯最近也终于没有说出这一意图。	The threat is only implicit; most Greeks do not want Grexit, and Varoufakis and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras have shied away of late from stating such intentions.
新环境条约的投资保护条款也应该剔除化石燃料项目，如法国总统马克龙在9月的联合国大会上所提出的《全球环境公约 》 （ Global Pact for the Environment ） 。	Fossil-fuel projects could also be exempted from investment protection in new environmental treaties, such as the Global Pact for the Environment presented by French President Emmanuel Macron to the UN General Assembly in September.
美元是主要全球货币，美联储的扩张性政策会给世界其他地区带来严重的外部效应 — — 这一点肯定不会进入美联储的考虑范围内。	Given the role of the US dollar as the dominant global currency, the Fed’s expansionary monetary policy generates significant externalities for the rest of the world – effects that the Fed is certainly not taking into account.
激进分子会提醒巴勒斯坦国民：这两项让步代表美国和以色列的胁迫，试图迫使巴勒斯坦人在占领和剥夺的事实面前低头。	Radicals will remind Palestinians that these two concessions represent a US-Israeli imposition and an attempt to force the Palestinians to bow to the realities of occupation and dispossession.
但“退出战略”方面的文献 — — 即关于如何以更具弹性的汇率取代货币盯住 — — 清楚地表明，中国已经错失平稳过渡的时机。	But the literature on “exit strategies” – on how to replace a currency peg with a more flexible exchange rate – makes clear that the moment when China could have navigated this transition smoothly has now passed.
而且，大约60个国家目前正扩散安全倡议中通力合作来防止危险武器和原料运送到恐怖分子或者非法政权手中。	Furthermore, roughly 60 nations are currently cooperating in the Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent dangerous weapons and materials from being transported to terrorists or outlaw regimes.
1989年和平席卷中国的政治运动最终阻止了赵紫阳为之献身的具有广泛基础的进步改革，这个结果充满了悲剧色彩。	It was a tragic paradox that the political movement that so peacefully swept China in 1989 ended up arresting the process of broad-based, evolutionary reform to which Zhao consecrated his life.
更不祥的是，这场冲突越来越像一场伊朗和逊尼派阿拉伯国家之间的代理人战争，而后者将本国的少数什叶派教徒视为伊朗的第五纵队。	Ominously, the conflict looks increasingly like a proxy war between Iran and the Sunni Arab states, which regard their own minority Shia populations as a potential Iranian fifth column.
欧盟的马斯特里赫特标准规定，赤字不得超过GDP的3 % ， 也属���类似情况：在政治压力转变以后，此类措施完全可能松懈下来，但最初在削减赤字和借贷成本方面，它们的确功不可没。	The European Union’s Maastricht criteria, which cap deficits at 3% of GDP, belong in the same category: a measure that could be relaxed as the political pressure changed, but which did help initially in reducing deficits and borrowing costs.
我访问的这些村庄 — — 遍布塔吉克斯坦、也门、马里、埃塞俄比亚、卢旺达、马拉维、柬埔寨及其他地方 — — 反映了全世界数以亿计的贫困人口的现状。	The villages that I visited – in Tajikistan, Yemen, Mali, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Malawi, Cambodia, and elsewhere – reflect the condition of hundreds of millions of impoverished people worldwide.
巴黎协议是一次跃进，表明了如何达成国际协定 — — 它兼具硬规则、不具约束力的承诺以及起支配作用的框架，让195个国家达成了协定。	That deal represented a leap forward in how international agreements are made, as it wove together hard rules, non-binding pledges, and overarching frameworks to enable an agreement among 195 countries.
这个人，现在坐在我身边，轻描淡写地解释说 ： “ 当然我必须依然保持对中国法制的信心，尽管我必须承认这次事件在某种程度上使我不再那么乐观了 。 ”	The man, now sitting next to me, explains with a bit of understatement, “Of course I must continue to have faith in the Chinese legal system, although I must admit that this incident has somewhat dampened my optimism.”
由于货币和财政安排没能抑制或消除道德风险，资本流造成这些内生不对称冲击的风险将继续维持相当高的水平。	To the extent that monetary and fiscal arrangements fail to reduce or eliminate moral hazard, the risk that capital flows create these endogenous asymmetric shocks will remain commensurately high.
技术的传播和积累非常缓慢，主要通过在职学习，这是一个模仿与重复的漫长过程：技术的学习主要通过实际操作。	Knowhow is transmitted and accumulated slowly, mostly on the job, through a protracted process of imitation and repetition: learning by doing.
后革命的理想破灭，特别是在反对共产主义的革命之后的理想破灭（乌克兰的情况则是反对后共产主义革命）扎根于人们的心理。	Post-revolutionary disillusion, especially after the revolutions against communism - and in Ukraine's case revolution against post-communism - is rooted in psychology.
但是，尽管这些扩张政策确实可能给其他经济体带来衰退性影响，但现代国际金融理论表明“货币战争”的概念纯属神话。	But, while it is true that such expansionary policies can have a recessionary impact on other economies, modern international-finance theory shows that the concept of a “currency war” is a myth.
可以肯定，全球贫困率已经达到历史低点，2010年极端贫困率（指按购买力平价计算生活费低于每天1.25美元的人口比例）比1990年下降了半数还多。	To be sure, the incidence of poverty worldwide has reached an historic low, with the extreme-poverty rate (the share of the population living on less than $1.25 a day, in purchasing-power-parity terms) falling in 2010 by more than half since 1990.
但是，尽管边际震慑是重要的，我相信杀人犯甚至可能以自身生命的代价拒逋，的确是罪犯们害怕死刑的间接证据。	But, while marginal deterrence is important, I believe the resistance of murderers to being captured, possibly at the expense of their own lives, is really indirect evidence that criminals do fear capital punishment.
病毒携带者/艾滋病患者也容易感染其他疾病：估计70%的南非艾滋病患者同时感染肺结核，而半数病毒携带者在一生中会有感染肺结核的经历。	HIV/AIDS patients are also prone to other infections: an estimated 70% of South Africans with AIDS also contract tuberculosis, while half of those carrying the HIV virus are expected to do so during their lifetime.
当内塔尼亚胡前往华盛顿，在美国国会上做关于伊朗的争议演说时，他被他的美国支持者称为“丘吉尔式”的人物，孤独地发声警告踌躇满志的世界警惕邪恶力量。	When Netanyahu traveled to Washington, DC, to deliver his controversial speech on Iran to the US Congress, he was described by his American supporters as “Churchillian,” the lonely courageous voice warning a complacent world against an evil force.
最终演变成我们今天熟知的混乱但具有革命意义的改变世界的力量（教皇弗朗西斯不久前称之为“来自上帝的礼物 ” 。 ）	Ultimately, it became the chaotic but revolutionary world-changer that we know today (“a gift from God,” as Pope Francis recently put it).
DFIC的危机解决能力对大型而复杂的跨境金融企业并不起作用。 原因很简单：美国法律只能创立在本国境内有效的危机处理机构。	The FDIC’s resolution powers will not work for large, complex cross-border financial enterprises. The reason is simple: US law can create a resolution authority that works only within national boundaries.
标准经济学假设社会由自利个体组成，他们在市场中交易，他们的选择通过“看不见的手”放大成一种效率状态（efficient state ） 。	Standard economics assumes that society is driven by self-seeking individuals trading in markets, whose choices scale up to an efficient state via the “invisible hand.”
他们需要想到2050年的世界和那时的90亿人口，并在今天做出正确的决策，确保给我们的子孙后代留下适宜生活的世界。	They need to imagine the world of 2050, with its nine billion people, and take the right decisions now to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a liveable world.
随着美国对集体责任的接受，也就是意味着放弃美国在IMF的一票否决权，对其他大多数的国家来说是一件好事。 同样欧洲也应该放弃在IMF任命执行总裁的权力。	This acceptance of collective responsibility should come with abandoning US veto power in the IMF by lowering required voting majorities, as well as abandoning Europe’s prerogative of appointing the Managing Director.
该地区人口中有60%是穆斯林，18%是佛教徒，17%是基督教徒，继续歧视罗兴亚人已经引起提供庇护的国家的同情的伊斯兰极端组织的大声疾呼。	The region’s population is 60% Muslim, 18% Buddhist, and 17% Christian; continued discrimination against the Rohingya already has become a rallying cry for sympathetic Islamic extremist groups in countries that provide asylum.
左翼联盟的经济计划拒绝接受所谓的“三驾马车 ” （ IMF、欧洲央行和欧盟委员会）所支持 — — 或如某些人所说为三驾马车所实施 — — 的紧缩政策。	Syriza’s economic program rejects the austerity policies supported – or, some might say, imposed – by the so-called “troika” (the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission).
即使如希腊激进左翼联盟这样的政党，一朝上台，也只能背弃选举承诺并不得不接受紧缩政策，因为知道退出欧盟代价更高。	Even Syriza, once in power, backpedaled and had to accept austerity, as an EU exit would have been much costlier.
更糟的是，传统经济的就业率增长加快，使得劳动力从高生产力领域流向低生产率领域 — — 这与所有经济体的目标背道而驰。	Worse, employment is growing faster in the traditional economy, in effect shifting labor from high-productivity to low-productivity work – the opposite of what any economy wants.
而在肯尼亚，年仅20岁的沙拉·奥米加在医院里挣扎了18个小时，尽管她自己在极大的痛苦下死里逃生，但没能保住肚里孩子的生命。	Or Sarah Omega, just 20, who spent 18 hours in labor at a hospital in Kenya. Her baby died, but she survived, despite terrible injuries, determined to speak out so that others would not have to endure the same ordeal.
此外，如德拉吉所言，真实短期和中期利率已经提高；长期利率则否，因为长期名义利率在下降，并且绝不仅限于欧元区。	Moreover, as Draghi noted, real short- and medium-term rates have increased; long-term rates have not, owing to a decline in long-term nominal rates that extends far beyond the eurozone.
公民对欧洲精英和超国家机构（如欧盟委员会）越来越不信任，因为它们所实施的规则和监管与其国家的经济利益和主权相冲突。	Citizens are becoming increasingly disenchanted with European elites and supra-national institutions such as the European Commission, which impose rules and regulations that conflict with their countries' economic interests and sovereignty.
此外，相对于1989年的东欧剧变，2011年的中东革命缺乏任何像北约和欧盟这样的外部稳定性架构，而这些组织可以用获取成员国资格的前景来影响地方改革。	Moreover, compared to Eastern Europe in 1989, the Middle East in 2011 lacks any stabilizing external structures, such as NATO and the European Union, that could influence domestic reforms by holding out the prospect of membership.
如今，尽管高姿态的措施 — — 比如扩大反腐运动 — — 吸引了大量注意力，但中国面临的更深层次的问题是国家和市场的合适角色问题。	And today, while high-profile initiatives – for example, the government’s widening anti-corruption campaign – receive much attention, the deeper issue that China faces concerns the appropriate roles of the state and the market.
类似地，哥斯达黎加国民银行（Banco Nacional）将几十名女性提拔到管理层；现在，该银行是女企业家金融的地区领先提供商。	Similarly, Costa Rica’s Banco Nacional has promoted dozens of women into managerial roles; the bank is now a leading regional provider of financing to female entrepreneurs.
除了那些部分或完全受到海平面上升的威胁国家，全球气候变暖还将主要影响沙漠带和那些地区已经岌岌可危的水供应。	Apart from those countries that are threatened – partly or completely –by rising sea levels, global warming will primarily affect the desert belts and their already precarious water supplies.
但即便美国及其盟国试图控制伊朗，伊朗政权仍继续激怒以色列，一边号召将以色列彻底消灭，一边向其黎巴嫩和加沙反对势力出口军事用品。	And, even as the US and its allies attempt to restrain Iran, its regime continues to goad Israel, calling for its extinction and exporting military wares to its Lebanese and Gazan adversaries.
但东欧签名者中影响力最大的要数格鲁吉亚第一夫人，而该国的爱滋病感染者数量（2700名）仅占整个地区的0.018 % 。	But the most influential Eastern European signatory was the First Lady of Georgia, a country whose estimated 2,700 HIV-infected people account for just 0.018% of the regional total.
但仍然爆发了反对TTIP的示威 — — 以及（在较小的程度上）反对欧盟目前与加拿大的贸易协议的示威 — — 因为一些人反对据说会让本地标准和监管低贸易伙伴一等的“新”协议。	But there are still protests against the TTIP – and, to a lesser extent, against the EU’s recent trade deal with Canada – because some object to “new” deals that supposedly subordinate local standards and regulations to those of trading partners.
塞巴斯蒂安·皮涅拉（Sebastián Piñera）指出，智利是成功市场改革的例子。 他将于3月11日卸任总统。	Chile is a case of successful pro-market reform, argues Sebastián Piñera, who stepped down from the presidency on March 11.
而令我记忆最深刻的，是那些成百上千张贴满墙壁的囚徒和受害者的黑白照片—人类苦难的恐怖蒙太奇，至今仍在我脑海中挥之不去。	Mostly, I remember the hundreds of black and white mug shots of prisoners and victims that covered every inch of the walls – a ghastly montage of human suffering that haunts me to this day.
同样重要的还有世界其余部分的经济和政治事件、国内外科技和人口力量，以及前任政府的政策（可能扩大或制约现任总统的选择范围 ） 。	Of equal importance are economic and political events in the rest of the world, technological and demographic forces at home and abroad, and the policies of previous administrations, which can expand or constrain a sitting president’s options.
克里克和沃森在富兰克林（Rosalind Franklin）和威尔金斯（Maurice Wilkins）工作的基础上发现了DNA的双螺旋结构，第一次窥探了生命体如何继承和储存生物信息。	Building on the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, they had discovered DNA’s double-helix structure, providing the first glimpse into how organisms inherit and store biological information.
由于在此期间农业产量将增加一倍以上，气候变化所带来的最坏的影响也不过是导致全球粮食产量翻一番不是在2080年而是延后到2081年实现。	Because agricultural output will more than double over this period, climate change would at worst cause global food production to double not in 2080 but in 2081.
这是一段超现实的体验，因为，在其2004年的小说《反美阴谋 》 （ The Plot Against America）中，罗斯准确地描述了美国目前身处其中的罪恶和令人发指的噩梦。	This was a surreal experience, given that, in his 2004 novel, The Plot Against America, Roth precisely described the sinister and chilling nightmare in which the United States now finds itself.
在发现了人类免疫缺陷病毒（HIV）是艾滋病的致病原因后，接着有解释了它的致病机理、自然史、流行病学，创立了诊断性血液检验、开发了抗逆转录病毒药物。	The discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the cause of AIDS was followed by elucidation of its pathogenesis, natural history, and epidemiology, the creation of a diagnostic blood test, and the development of antiretroviral drugs.
通过联合密克罗尼西亚联邦共同开展这些工作，瑙鲁协定缔约国可以提升透明度要求，并设定渔业管理的新标准。	By joining FSM in these efforts, the PNA could raise the bar for transparency and set a new standard for fisheries management.
另一方面，如果人民民主党能够达到10%的门槛，那么它的命运 — — 连同埃尔多安的命运 — — 都将走向另一个方向。	If, on the other hand the HDP can reach the 10% threshold, its fortunes – and Erdoğan’s – will swing in the other direction.
尽管中国对朝鲜越来越不耐烦的态度被视为最终政策转变的先兆而颇受欢迎，但中国新思维并没有阻止美国强化与韩国和日本的军事合作。	And, while growing signs of impatience with North Korea have been welcomed as a harbinger of an eventual policy shift, fresh thinking in China has not been sufficient to forestall US efforts to step up military cooperation with South Korea and Japan.
1945年，他在致艾略特（T. S. Eliot）的信中写到 ： “ 以投资作为手段实现充分就业的政策只是理论定理的一项具体应用。	In 1945, he wrote to T.S. Eliot: “[T]he full employment policy by means of investment is only one particular application of an intellectual theorem.
想一想：在过去几年中，许多候选HIV、登革热、疱疹、肺结核和金黄葡萄球菌疫苗遭遇了失败，超过10亿美元随之��流。	Consider this: In just the past few years, many candidate vaccines against HIV, dengue, herpes, tuberculosis, and staphylococcus aureus have failed, at a cost of more than $1 billion.
有些国家希望订立一个安全保证条约，确保无核国家不会受到核武器威胁；而另一些国家则试图订立条约防止在外太空出现军备竞赛。	Some want a treaty on security guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon states to assure them against the threat or use of nuclear weapons; others want a treaty to prevent an arms race in outer space.
此外，尽管阿巴斯或许会被粉饰现状的方案诱惑，但大部分巴勒斯坦人也许会认为这是赤裸裸的欺骗，断然拒绝。	And, although Abbas might be tempted by cosmetic changes to the status quo, most Palestinians probably would reject them as fraudulent.
拟议中在美国和墨西哥边境筑墙也是如此，这堵墙将令特朗普已经授权建造的从巴西到印度尼西亚的世界所有国家的建筑相形见绌。	That is also true of his proposed wall on the US border with Mexico, which will outshine all the buildings around the world – from Brazil to Indonesia – to which he has licensed his name.
俄罗斯不但向分裂组织提供重武器和先进武器，还部署特种部队支持他们，而如今，俄罗斯似乎还在派遣“志愿者”前去训练分裂势力部队，使其立刻可以继续战斗。	"Beyond supplying the separatist groups with heavy and advanced weapons, and deploying special units and forces to support them, Russia now appears to be sending in “volunteers"" to train a separatist army that could ultimately go on the offensive."
而且，现在不是我们对中国经济刺激计划 不 知情的东西让人感觉棘手，而是我们已经知道了的东西令人觉得如此。	Still, it is not what we don’t know about the stimulus plan that is troublesome.
但是，自朝鲜战争的顶峰（7 % ） 以来，全球成本一直在稳步下降，1980年大约为3.5 % ， 现在为1.7%左右。	Yet, since the Korean War peak of 7%, global costs have declined steadily, reaching 3.5% in 1980 and about 1.7% today.
从跨国监管者网络，国际公民社会组织到多边机构，新的治理模型正在超越并取代那些只为单一国家服务的立法者。	New modes of governance, ranging from transnational networks of regulators to international civil-society organizations to multilateral institutions, are transcending and supplanting national lawmakers.
独立的中央银行发展到现在这个阶段，产业核心的货币政策还远非完美，但却比以前好得多，从而代表了技术统治论的胜利。	Monetary policy in the industrial core has been far from perfect in this age of independent central banks, but it has been much better than what came before, representing a victory for technocracy.
70/30的分割进一步凸显了挑战：美国必须直面一次根本性的调整 — — 逐渐摆脱对国内需求的过度依赖，并向外部需求争取更多的支持。	The 70/30 split underscores the challenge: the US must face up to a fundamental rebalancing – weaning itself from excessive reliance on internal demand and drawing greater support from external demand.
我们正在重整这个曾经动荡不安的国度，连希望 — — 这个至关紧要的元素 — — 也开始回到了人民心中。	We are restoring our once-vibrant nation, and the crucial component -- hope -- has already been revived.
多数民众认同奥巴马总统的观点，即降低财政赤字应对过去30年来收入和财富增长最多的前2-3%的纳税人增税。	The majority of citizens agree with President Barack Obama that tax increases for deficit reduction should fall on the top 2-3% of taxpayers, who have enjoyed the largest gains in income and wealth over the last 30 years.
他已经发现推动民主运动的一个根本缺陷：告诉别人怎样推进民主改革与冒险亲身实验并承担责任并不是一回事。	He had identified a fundamental shortfall in the movement to promote democracy: telling someone how to implement democratic reforms is not the same as taking on the risks and responsibilities of actually doing it.
社交媒体号称要取代传统新闻组织，成为世界信息平台，但社交媒体巨头似乎对于忽视新闻的基本价值观、程序和目标感到心安理得。	Despite pushing to displace traditional news outlets as the world’s information platforms, social media’s moguls appear content to ignore journalism’s fundamental values, processes, and goals.
据估计，美国有九分之一的桥梁具有结构缺陷，42%的城市道路存在拥挤，每年浪费掉的时间和能源成本据估计高达1,010亿美元。	An estimated one out of every nine US bridges is structurally deficient, and 42% of urban roads are congested, costing the economy an estimated $101 billion a year in wasted time and fuel consumption.
2月，在民粹主义内政部长的命令下，奥地利警方突击搜查了奥地利主要情报机关 — — 负责监控右翼极端主义的组织。	In February, on orders from the populist interior minister, Austrian police raided the country’s main intelligence agency – the very organization charged with monitoring right-wing extremism.
去年据经济与气候全球委员会研究测算2010年仅悬浮颗粒物一项就在世界最大的煤炭消费国中国造成123万人死亡。	Research for the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate last year calculated that particulate matter alone caused 1.23 million premature deaths in China – the world’s top coal-consuming economy – in 2010.
与此同时，减疟伙伴关系最近已经启动了一项全球商业计划，以统一抵抗疟疾的各界人士的行动，并刺激更多的投资。	At the same time, the Roll Back Malaria Partnership has recently launched a long-term Global Action Plan to unify the actions of the malaria community and spur additional investment.
国际制度没能有效地解决中东核问题的主要原因是俄罗斯－美国的分歧，而刚愎自用的美国策略是造成这一分歧的主要原因。	The international system’s failure to address effectively the nuclear issue in the Middle East stems mostly from the Russia-US divide, to which wrongheaded American strategy has contributed mightily.
而尽管围绕英国退欧的细节还存在很多不确定性，但几乎没有人怀疑，不论欧盟采取什么计划，英国都不再是其中一分子。	And, despite the uncertainty surrounding the details of Brexit, there is little doubt that, whatever plans the European Union makes, it will be doing so without the United Kingdom as a member.
目前，最重要的国际机构 — — 世贸组织和国际货币基金组织（IMF ） — —都无法通过自身有效应对可能的货币操纵。	As it stands, the relevant international institutions – the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund – are not organized to respond effectively to possible currency manipulation on their own.
叙利亚代尔祖尔省（Deir al-Zour）和伊拉克安巴尔省（Anbar）的社会、部落和经济联系很强，随着叙利亚和伊拉克政府控制的松动，这种联系进一步强化了。	Social, tribal, and economic ties between the provinces of Deir al-Zour in Syria and Anbar in Iraq are strong and have strengthened further as control by the Syrian and Iraqi governments has loosened.
而事实上，他的多卷本二战著作内容全部是他最值得铭记的事件 （ “ 光荣时刻 ” ， “从未有如此之少的人，在如此之短的时间内,为如此之多的人，作出如此之大的牺牲 ” ） ；此外还充斥着对他在战时行为合理性的论证。	And, indeed, his multi-volume opus on World War II contains not only many of his most memorable lines (“their finest hour,” “so much owed by so many to so few”); it is also packed with justifications for his actions during the war.
同样 ， “ 网络战争”一词被用来松散地指代一系列行为，反映出从武装冲突到敌对较量等各式各样的字典涵义（如“两性战争”或“禁毒战争 ” ） 。	Similarly, the term “cyber war” is used loosely to cover a wide range of behaviors, reflecting dictionary definitions of war that range from armed conflict to any hostile contest (for example, “war between the sexes” or “war on drugs”).
所以，最后，希望在世界食物安全峰会上，各国政府都能够拿出令人信服的诚意，为一个共同目标而努力：让世界免于饥饿。	So finally let the World Summit on Food Security provide tangible evidence of a commitment from all governments to a common objective: a world free of hunger.
目前，公司税收入占GDP的2 % ， 减税方案将让其下降到GDP的1%左右，按目前的经济规模计算，即1,900亿美元。	With corporate-tax revenue currently equal to 2% of GDP, the proposed rate cut would reduce revenue by about 1% of GDP, or $190 billion a year in today’s economy.
第三，政府资助的大型抵押贷款企业房利美和房地美应当发挥宏观经济政策工具的作用，让住房建设恢复到其长期趋势水平。	Third, the large government-sponsored mortgage enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should be used as macroeconomic-policy tools to restore housing construction to its long-term trend level.
维也纳—四十年前，欧洲安全与合作会议（Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe）促成了赫尔辛基最终决议（Helsinki Final Act ） ， 这是一次历史性胜利，合作战胜了冲突，并为冷战的结束搭好了舞台。	VIENNA – Forty years ago, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe concluded with the signing of the Helsinki Final Act, a historic triumph of cooperation over conflict that set the stage for the end of the Cold War.
克林顿在他当选之前也说了同样的话，然而在他当选后的第一任期中对纽特·金里奇领导的在国会占多数的共和党进行打击，在他的第二个任期中忙于击退对他的弹劾。	Bill Clinton said much the same thing before he was elected, and then spent his first term in a knockdown fight with Newt Gingrich’s Republican majority in Congress, and his second term fighting off impeachment.
而事实上，可以想象推进改变反射率的研究共同努力能够刺激减排行动，就像化疗副作用的照片促使一些人戒烟那样。	And, in fact, it is conceivable that a concerted effort to advance research on albedo modification could spur action to cut emissions, much like a graphic look at the side effects of chemotherapy prompts some to stop smoking.
岛上使用美元货币，且美国国会在波多黎各强制推行联邦最低工资标准，尽管像安妮·克鲁格所指出的那样 ，岛上的人均收入仅为美国最贫困州的一半。	The island uses the US dollar, and the US Congress imposed on Puerto Rico the federal minimum wage, even though its per capita income is – as Anne Krueger has pointed out – about half that of the poorest US state.
这种广泛流行的误解，至少部分源自一个事实，即妇女相对来说更可能知道他们是否感染了艾滋病毒，因为他们在产科诊所作怀孕测试或身体检查时，检查艾滋病毒是常规的检测项目。	This popular misconception springs, at least in part, from the fact that women are more likely to know their HIV status because they are routinely tested for HIV at maternity clinics when they seek pregnancy tests or examinations.
事实上，墨西哥的垄断结构和权力的巨大集中仍然未被触及 — — 和卡尔德龙唯一的两位民主前任欧内斯托·塞迪略（Ernesto Zedillo）和福克斯时期一样。	Indeed, Mexico’s monopoly structures and immense concentration of power remain untouched – as they were under Calderón’s only two democratic predecessors, Ernesto Zedillo and Fox.
在伊斯兰政党政府的四个部门中，他们对女性工作人员强加诸多限制，引发了大规模的抗议，最终这四个部门部长被迫辞职。	In the four ministries the Islamists ran, they imposed restrictions on female staff members, triggering widespread protests that ultimately forced the four ministers to resign.
当然，正如我和我的审查报告共同撰写者在《超级细菌：针对细菌的军备竞赛》一书中所指出的那样，这个提案相当于一种温和的“要么出钱要么出力”资本主义形式。	To be sure, as my Review colleagues and I note in Superbugs: An Arms Race Against Bacteria, this proposal amounts to a mild form of “pay or play” capitalism.
这些难民大部分来自中东 — — 特别是叙利亚，也有的来自阿富汗、伊拉克、也门和利比亚 — — 因此中东地区承担了绝大部分难民负担亦不足为奇。	With most of the refugees originating in the Middle East – especially Syria, but also Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, and Libya – the fact that the region is shouldering the overwhelming share of the burden is not surprising.
圣安德鲁斯，苏格兰—上个月，电影发烧友们纷纷涌入影院观看《猩球崛起3：终极之战 》 。 在这部影片中，一支经逆转录病毒“改造”过的灵长类大军，向人类发起了战争。	ST ANDREWS, SCOTLAND – Last month, moviegoers flocked to theaters to see War for the Planet of the Apes, in which an army of retrovirus-modified primates wage war against humanity.
抗议者发言人帕特里克·摩尔（Patrick Moore，他本人早先也是绿色和平组织成员）指责该组织是每年两百万儿童死亡的帮凶。	Patrick Moore, a spokesperson for the protesters – and himself an early Greenpeace member – accused the organization of complicity in the deaths of two million children per year.
左倾政府在拉丁美洲的崛起，特别是埃沃•莫拉莱斯（Evo Morales）当选为玻利维亚总统，是否预示着整个拉美政治在向强硬的左倾路线过渡？	Does the rise of left-leaning governments in Latin America, particularly the election of Evo Morales as President of Bolivia, presage a shift to the hard left across the continent?
如果信任崩溃且伊朗政府决定废除所有相关国际协议，那么即使伊朗遭到反复轰炸，这个国家仍极有可能最终研制出核武器。	If trust were to collapse, and the Iranian regime decided to abrogate all of the relevant international agreements, it is highly likely that it would get its weapon, even if the country itself was bombed repeatedly.
鉴于上述研发的安全影响，以及诸如数据隐私和安全、社会分裂及外国干预选举等一系列问题，各国不愿放弃监管互联网。	Given the security implications of these developments, as well as a host of issues like data privacy and security, social fragmentation, and foreign interventions in elections, countries are unwilling to leave the Internet unregulated.
由于这种煽动性主张在新闻中占据主导地位，因此官员们不必承认他们缺乏准备，且未能采纳和执行恰当的法律和安全法规。	With such incendiary claims dominating the news, officials avoid having to admit their lack of preparedness and their failure to adopt and enforce appropriate laws and safety regulations.
国际刑事法院利（IVCC）比亚代表艾哈迈德最近告诉我说 ： “ 我们利比亚人不能开始对赛义夫的审判。	Ahmad Jihani, Libya’s representative to the International Criminal Court, recently told me that, “we as Libyans cannot begin Saif’s trial.
德拉吉和欧洲央行理事会内的鸽派 — — 即欧洲南部各国央行的行长们 — — 似乎认为，他们只需给一辆车加油就能让它跑起来，即便其离合器早已失灵。	Draghi and the doves on the ECB Governing Council – namely, the presidents of southern European countries’ central banks – seem to think that they can get a car moving simply by giving it more gas, even if its clutch is broken.
该回报率接近在艾滋病毒和儿童免疫领域最成功的全球健康投资，而且因为同样的原因应该是非常值得的投资项目：和平包容的全球经济需要以健康、高效的生活为条件。	That return is comparable to the most successful global health investments in HIV and childhood immunization, and it is an investment worth making for the same reason: a peaceful, inclusive global economy presupposes healthier, more productive lives.
发自华盛顿 — — 阿拉伯世界的经验表明，在涉及到安全部门改革问题的时候，光靠技术官僚的手段是不够的。	WASHINGTON, DC – Experience across the Arab world demonstrates that when it comes to security-sector reform, technocratic approaches are inadequate.
如果寇蒂斯失败的话，他早就被遗忘在历史长河中了，即使被记住，也是作为愚蠢的自大狂 — — 居然不自量力地想打败伟大的帝国。	Had Cortés’s strategy failed, he would have gone down in history – if he was remembered at all – as an arrogant fool who thought that he could defeat a great empire.
沃伦提供了一个具有说服力，温和的替代性金融部门政策方案，而且会在党内初选中占优势并在总统大选中赢得广泛支持。	Warren offers a plausible, moderate alternative approach to financial-sector policy that would play well in the primaries and attract a great deal of support in the general election.
与此同时，国民储蓄有所下降，占GDP之比与2007年相比下降3.5个百分点（据IMF估计，2013年底官方数据 ） 。	Meanwhile, there has been some decline in national saving, by perhaps 3.5 percentage points of GDP compared to 2007 (according to IMF estimates, as official data end in 2013).
而在今时今日油价戏剧性回落之后，这种慷慨疏财之举就再也行不通了。 经济专家们更一致认为，俄罗斯石油经济的发展潜力已经被过早地耗尽了。	Today, with oil prices dramatically reduced, this largesse is no longer available, and economic experts agree that the growth potential of Russia’s petro-economy has been exhausted.
但是1973年的教训就是，波斯湾石油供应中断将会太高价格，破坏富国和穷国的经济，而无论其自身的供应有多么的可靠。	But the lesson of 1973 is that a disruption of Gulf oil supplies would raise prices and damage both rich and poor economies, regardless of how secure their own sources of supply might be.
一次大战和奥特曼帝国沦陷后，胜利的联军曾许诺他们建立自己的国家¾这一誓言却为顾全英法帝国的利益而遭到可耻的被判。	After World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Allies promised them a state of their own - a promise that was cynically betrayed when British and French imperial interests took precedence.
在不久之前，诸如前脑叶白质切除术和ECT这样的医学治疗方法仍然可以在没有得到病人的同意下在他们身上使用，并且有时候是为了达到惩罚的目的。	Not so long ago, physical treatments such as lobotomy and ECT could be inflicted on patients without their consent, and sometimes for punitive purposes.
La recherche fondamentale est l’organisme de base de la chaîne alimentaire de l’effort scientifique.	Basic research is the primary organism in the food chain of scientific endeavor.
相反，可支配收入增长（以及它所带来的消费增长）在去年之所以能够持续，是因为增加了1.4万亿美元的减税并延长了转移支付，而这意味着公共债务又增加了1.4万亿美元。	Rather, growth in disposable income (and thus in consumption) has been sustained since last year by another $1.4 trillion in tax cuts and extended transfer payments, implying another $1.4 trillion of public debt.
它不是由直接投资或组合投资驱动的，而主要来自中国人民银行，后者囤积了3.5万亿美元外汇储备，其中大部分是美国国债。	Rather than being driven by direct or portfolio investment, they came primarily from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), as it amassed $3.5 trillion in foreign reserves – largely US Treasury securities.
德国总理默克尔给出了正确的答案。 上个月，在与特朗普和其他G7领导人会晤之后，默克尔说欧洲不能继续“完全仰仗他人 ” ， 而必须“靠自己为自己的未来奋斗 。 ”	Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel gave the right answer when, after meeting with Trump and other G7 leaders last month, she said that Europe could no longer “fully count on others,” and would have to “fight for our own future ourselves.”
在发达国家，近90%15至64岁的民众都至少接受过某种程度的中等教育，而发展中国家这一比例只有63 % 。	In advanced countries, almost 90% of the population aged 15-64 has attained at least some secondary education, compared to only 63% in developing countries.
经济压力本来就已经在不断撩动着西班牙，意大利甚至法国的反欧洲情绪；如果任由其发展，这种情绪将将最终导致独立行为，为欧元区以及欧洲整体带来灾难性的后果。	Already, economic pressures have fueled anti-European sentiment in Spain, Italy, and even France; if allowed to continue, such sentiment could culminate in secession, with devastating consequences for the eurozone and Europe as a whole.
2005年，阿根廷政府终于拨冗参与债务互换谈判时，它几乎可以任意指定条件 — — 70%的“剃头 ” （ haircut ） 。	When, in 2005, the government finally got around to negotiating a debt swap, it could almost dictate the terms – a 70% “haircut.”
匈牙利政府缴纳了100,000欧元（合117，000美元）罚款，但巴卡的职务和法治体系均未能得到恢复。	The Hungarian government paid a €100,000 ($117,000) fine, but neither Baka’s position nor the rule of law was restored.
但正如希腊近来已经了解的那样，外部自然资源依赖国可能在商品价格上涨或自身支付能力下降时出现经济震荡。	But, as Greece has recently learned, countries dependent on external natural resources can experience economic shocks when commodity prices increase or their ability to pay otherwise declines.
过往灾难的大众想像是民间传说的一部分，它们经常被掩埋在记忆的阴暗之端，但是它们不时会重新显现，给我们造成麻烦。	Popular images of past disasters are part of our folklore, often buried in the dim reaches of our memory, but re-emerging to trouble us from time to time.
但这也不太可能，因为计划早就在金融圈中公布了，穆迪（Moody’s）等评级机构也认为吸收损失的债务比常规债务风险更大。	But this is also unlikely, because the plan has been well publicized in financial circles, and ratings agencies like Moody’s count the loss-absorbing debt as riskier than banks’ regular debt.
发自香港 — — 经济学家阿克塞尔·莱琼霍夫德（Axel Leijonhufvud）在近期的一篇文章中将市场体系定义为一个合约网络。	HONG KONG – In a recent article, the economist Axel Leijonhufvud defines the market system as a web of contracts.
欧元区尤其如此。 加入共同货币区时，欧元区成员国放弃了加速过程的关键工具 — — 调整汇率以契合不同经济体的生产率水平。	This is particularly true in the eurozone, whose members abandoned a crucial tool for accelerating the process – exchange-rate adjustments to account for different economies’ productivity levels – when they adopted the common currency.
如今，来到我们的数字家门口的大部分东西最多只算得上是“假新闻 ” ： 骗人的故事、宣传和其他形式的误导信息。	Much of what arrives on our digital doorstep these days is best described as “fake news”: hoax stories, propaganda, and other forms of misinformation.
但是，尽管全球储蓄完全足够推动可持续发展转型，但到目前为止，全球金融体系并没能在供给和需求之间搭起有效的桥梁。	But although global savings are more than adequate to fuel the transition to sustainable development, the global financial system has so far failed to effectively intermediate supply and demand.
同样，债务回购也将是对官方资源的严重浪费，因为回购使会高估这些债券的折余价值，从中受益的将主要是债权人，而不是主权债务人。	Likewise, debt buybacks would be a massive waste of official resources, as the residual value of the debt increases as it is bought, benefiting creditors far more than the sovereign debtor.
发自剑桥 — — 随着这几年私人资本崛起以及来自中国的资金激增，世界银行的融资角色已经黯然失色，其领导人一直在想方设法寻求新的使命。	CAMBRIDGE – In recent years, as the World Bank’s financing role has been eclipsed by the rise of private capital and a surge in money from China, its leaders have been desperately seeking a new mission.
20世纪20年代早期的大通胀期间，最严重的时候物价一天涨好几回，打垮了中产阶级，动摇了政治稳定，为希特勒的最终上台创造了机会。	The Great Inflation of the early 1920’s, which culminated in a hyper-inflation in which prices changed several times daily, destroyed the middle classes and bred the political instability that eventually opened the way to Hitler’s rise.
爱尔兰民主联盟党拒绝接受一切特殊安排或“兜底”来让北爱尔兰留在关税联盟以代替英国-欧盟自由贸易协议。	The DUP has denounced all talk of a special arrangement or “backstop” to enable Northern Ireland to remain in the customs union in lieu of a UK-EU free-trade deal.
比如，航空公司 — — 它们实际上只服务于7%的全球人口 — — 免于缴纳燃料税是没有道理的，特别是在机票价格处于历史地位时。	For example, it makes little sense that airlines – which actually serve just 7% of the global population – are exempt from paying fuel taxes, especially at a time when ticket prices are at an historic low.
而如果PPBM成为捍卫马来人高人一等地位的对手，巫统将失去在这一问题上 的垄断权，让马来政治陷入更大的斗争。	And if the PPBM is established as a rival defender of Malays’ favored status, the UMNO would lose its monopoly on the issue, making Malay politics more competitive.
签署宣言即做出了政治承诺保护教育，即使是在最残酷的冲突中也是如此 — — 也就是说，这是一个保护全世界儿童的承诺。	Signing the Declaration amounts to a political commitment to protect education, even during the most savage conflicts – which is to say that it is a commitment to protect the world’s children.
我们所做的选择要么会在加强国际合作的基础上协助建立更加开放的社会，要么会助长独裁政府及其民族主义议程。	Depending on the choices we make, we will either help create more open societies, based on greater international cooperation, or we will abet authoritarian governments and their nationalist agendas.
但是，尽管法国的大选结果很大程度地取决于欧洲债务危机的策略，德国政府的行为似乎表明这一结果与其毫无关系。	But, while the French election’s outcome will hinge to a crucial extent on European crisis politics, Germany’s government acts as if this were none of its concern.
当今贸易战的第一次正式宣战发生在钢铁行业 — — 最出类拔萃的“旧经济”行业，但深受产能过剩的困扰（特别是在中国 ） 。	The first formal manifestation of today’s trade tensions occurred in the steel sector – an “old economy” industry par excellence, one that is plagued, especially in China, by enormous excess capacity.
但没人应该被这种时髦的行话说蒙蔽：新的生产技术通常会在该模式的好处彻底实现之前杀死老的产业和就业机会。	But no-one should be gulled by jargon: New ways of producing things often kill off old industries and jobs before the full benefits of the successor mode of production are realized.
中国政府一向对外交礼节斤斤计较，因此，人们难以想象，中国政府并无刻意安排，从而显示出美国相对于持有一万四千亿美元国债的国家衰落这一鲜明形象。	It is hard to imagine that China’s government, which obsesses over every minute issue of diplomatic protocol, had not orchestrated this stark image of America’s decline relative to the country to which it owes $1.4 trillion.
但就像我们近来所看到的那样，资本流动变幻莫测，如果撒哈拉以南非洲要充分利用目前的全球经济增长，那么决策者就必须在还有能力的情况下正面弥补公共债务漏洞。	But, as we have seen recently, capital flows are fickle, and if Sub-Saharan Africa is to take full advantage of the current global economic upswing, policymakers must tackle public-debt vulnerabilities head-on while they can.
在安倍最新首相任期的前六个季度里，年化真实GDP增长平均只有1.4 % — —只比1992年以来长期低迷的总平均水平1%略高。	In the six quarters of Shinzo Abe’s latest stint as prime minister, annualized real GDP growth has averaged just 1.4% – up only slightly from the anemic post-1992 average of 1%.
但当时全世界领导人都盛赞巴黎协定是遏制气候变化的一次突破，是国际合作的一次胜利，是全球经济的一个福音。	But leaders from around the world have already hailed the agreement as a breakthrough for the fight against climate change, a victory for international cooperation, and a boon to the global economy.
我们寄希望于今天的领导人明白这一点，也能坚守这一点，从而将他们的创新能量放在构建让国家走向更繁荣、更平等之路的新的愿景上。	Our best hope is that today’s leaders understand it and will adhere to it, thereby putting their creative energies to work on a new vision that places their countries on a path to greater prosperity and equity.
毕竟我们需要它们来执行标准，原则，规范以及决策程序，以求在处于准无政府状态的国际社会中某些国家自己不动手应对，却从别人的应对措施中占便宜的问题。	We need their help to implement norms, principles, rules, and decision-making procedures, thereby mitigating the endemic free-rider problems in quasi-anarchical international society.
联合国秘书长潘基文呼吁在2014年举行气候变化领导人峰会；如今，这一峰会应该成为公众压力的焦点，以促使在2015年达成协定。	UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for a leader’s summit on climate change in 2014; that summit must now become the focus of public pressure to move toward an agreement in 2015.
像阿拉伯之春这样的事件所释放出来的长期受到压制的思想和能量必须先经历成熟的过程，才能够全面地影响社会。	The long-suppressed ideas and energies unleashed by events like the Arab Spring must mature before having their full effect on society.
如果世界银行平静地接受这个提议，即通过耗尽最贫穷国家的储备来为减免他们的债务融资、然后通过减少世界银行的贷款资本让贫穷国家为最贫穷国家付钱，那对布什会大有帮助。	It would have been helpful for Bush if the World Bank quietly accepted proposals to finance debt relief for the poorest countries by depleting its reserves, thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the Bank’s lending capacity.
那些认为危机爆发前除了银行在疯狂放贷之外经济一切都好的人相信未来要防止这样的危机只需要进行银行业的改革。	Those who believe that all was fine with the pre-crisis economy except for banks making crazy loans are convinced that preventing such crises in the future requires only banking reform.
只要该地区各经济体继续欣欣向荣，就不会有人有动力认识 — — 更不用说纠正 — — 它们所面临的问题。	As long as the region’s economies were thriving, there was little incentive to identify – much less address – the problems facing them.
大多数印度的穷邦 - - 如比哈尔邦(Bihar ) 、 中央邦(Madhya Pradesh ) 、 奥里萨(Orissa ) 、 拉贾斯坦(Rajasthan)和北方邦（Uttar Pradesh ） - -都面临着经济发展缓慢但人口增长迅速的问题。	Most of India's big poor states - Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh - suffer from a combination of relatively slow economic growth and rapid demographic growth.
）1971年来秘书长职务已经在西欧、拉美、非洲和亚洲（目前正履行第二届任期的秘书长潘基文来自韩国）轮换了一遍，只有一个联合国地区尚未选出代表，那就是东欧。	With the position having cycled, since 1971, through Western Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia – Ban Ki-moon, the current second-term secretary-general, hails from South Korea – only one UN region has yet to be represented: Eastern Europe.
在西方国家，特别是美国，当民主产生的时刻（对其他人来说这首先意味着“选举 ” ） 到来时，往往过份的想当然。	In Western countries, notably in the US, people tend to assume too much when it comes to bringing democracy – meaning elections in the first instance – to others.
这种行事方式从一开始就是东盟经济战略不可或缺的一部分，并将继续延续下去，与即将建立的区域综合经济伙伴关系框架下将东盟与中国、日本、韩国、印度、澳大利亚和新西兰连结起来。	This approach has been integral to ASEAN’s economic strategy from the beginning, and continues with the soon-to-be concluded Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership joining ASEAN with China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand.
今年4月，因为诚实守信给她打高分的民主党人仅有40 % ， 而且仅有50%的民主党人认为她总体而言是讨人喜欢的。	In April, only 40% of Democrats gave her high marks for being honest and trustworthy, and only 50% of Democrats rated her favorably overall.
因此，俄罗斯用类似于保护责任的概念论证自己的干涉看上去颇为讽刺。 俄罗斯实际上是在保护政府免遭公民侵犯，而不是相反。	So it is ironic, to say the least, that Russia is using a concept similar to R2P to justify its intervention, only in this case it is defending the government from its citizens, rather than the other way around.
投资者还需要考虑“碳泡沫 ” ， 即基于化石燃料公司能够一直将全球储量燃烧殆尽的假设给予这些公司过高的估值。	Investors also need to consider “carbon bubbles,” the overvaluation of fossil-fuel companies based on the assumption that they will be able to continue burning the world’s reserves until depletion.
上个月，习近平在中央委员会十一届三中全会上宣布了全套改革措施，提出了“实现中华民族伟大复兴” 的目标。	Last month, President Xi Jinping announced a set of sweeping economic reforms at the Central Committee’s Third Plenum, setting forth his vision of “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”
它们对联盟党应该也具有新引力，因为支持五星运动党首马特奥·萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）的企业主将得益于成本下降和竞争力增强。	They should also appeal to the League, insofar as business owners who support party leader Matteo Salvini will benefit from declining costs and enhanced competitiveness.
此次书展是为了纪念最终导致巴基斯坦军方朝达卡大学学生开火的1952年示威而举办的一年一度的活动，也是典型的孟加拉人应对暴力的方式。	The book fair, held annually to commemorate the 1952 protests that culminated in the Pakistani military opening fire on students at the university, is a typically Bengali response to violence.
这需要增加欧洲战略投资基金（European Fund for Strategic Investments）的长期资金，而德国政府应该为此做出直接贡献。	This would require more funding in the long run for the European Fund for Strategic Investments, to which the German government should contribute directly.
不过，在欧元危机中，核心国的责任要比1982年和1997年更大：核心国设计了一个有缺陷的货币体系，又没能纠正其中的缺陷。	Yet, in the euro crisis, the center’s responsibility is even greater than it was in 1982 or 1997: it designed a flawed currency system and failed to correct the defects.
赵紫阳之死不仅提醒了我们他曾经遇到过怎样的不公正待遇，而且再一次让我们想起了中国的改革是多么不平衡。	Zhao Ziyang’s death reminds us not only of how unjustly he was treated, but of how lopsided China’s reforms have been.
其中有些可以学习和培养，事实证明教授积极思维习惯 — — 比方说学会欣赏重要事务或避免纠结于挫折 — — 的课程已经对幸福造成了重大改变。	Some of these can be learned or cultivated, and courses that teach positive mental habits – like appreciating things that matter or avoiding dwelling on setbacks – have demonstrated measurable improvements in wellbeing.
过度慷慨的养老金福利破坏了公共财政的稳定，损害了代际之间社会契约，并助长了对极右翼民粹主义运动的支持。	Overly generous pension benefits are destabilizing public finances, compromising the intergenerational social contract, and fueling support for far-right populist movements.
当然，如果这位居民已经拥有了可售住房，那么他可能认为价格上涨等于是天降横财，可以卖了房子带着这笔横财离开。	Of course, if that inhabitant already owned a house there that they can sell, they may regard the price increase as a windfall that they can claim by departing.
由我担任主席的抗耐药性评估（Review on Antimicrobial Resistance）已经建议中国承担这样的责任，并在与一些中国决策者的讨论中提出了这一点。	We at the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance (which I chair) have already recommended such a role for China, including in discussions with some Chinese policymakers.
增加新功能可以加快转型的速度，但必要的却只是让新系统在某些方面与现有系统不兼容，还要有足够数量的人认为新系统将要成为新的标准。	Adding new features can speed the transition, but what is necessary is only that the new system be incompatible with existing systems in certain respects, and that a sufficient number of people expect that it will become the new standard.
华盛顿 — — 众所周知，已故英国历史学家埃里克·霍布斯鲍姆（Eric Hobsbawm）将1914年弗朗兹·费迪南大公遇刺和1991年苏联解体之间的这段时期称之为“浓缩的二十世纪 ” 。	WASHINGTON, DC – The late British historian Eric Hobsbawm famously called the period between Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s assassination in 1914 and the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991 the “short twentieth century.”
批评者警告这会导致人才外流，但我们真的认为，1%的税收会让风险资本家彼得·提尔（Peter Thiel）这样的人收拾家当搬到新西兰去吗？	Critics will warn of a brain drain, but do we really think that a 1% tax would convince, say, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel to pack up and move to New Zealand?
尽管如今更多的人反对紧缩，但经济学家完全没有注意到新兴经济体在被危机袭击时受到的煎熬，这是极不明智的。	While many more protest austerity today, it was not that smart economists were totally oblivious of the pain emerging economies were going through when they were hit by crisis.
美国和世界其他国家都应该从中汲取许多教训；其中最重要的是对金融行业更严格的监管，特别是针对掠夺性的贷方提供更好的保护和更高的透明度。	There are many lessons for America, and the rest of the world; but among them is the need for greater financial sector regulation, especially better protection against predatory lending, and more transparency.
美国总统特朗普在得知化学袭击之后大发雷霆，但这只不过是暴露了他在处理叙利亚问题手法上的朝三暮四和前后矛盾，以及真正战略眼光的缺失。	US President Donald Trump’s bluster in the wake of the chemical attack exposes the incoherence and contradictions of his approach, as well as his lack of any real strategy in Syria.
虽然1999年还戴着欧洲病夫的帽子，但今天的德国拥有欧洲大陆最强势经济，以及约占欧洲四分之一的出口份额。	Regarded as the sick man of Europe as recently as 1999, today the country boasts the continent's strongest economy, accounting for roughly a quarter of its exports.
2010年墨西哥湾深海钻井漏油事件后，奥巴马政府建立了X奖基金会（X-Prize Foundation ） ， 向提供最有效原油回收方案的团队奖励140万美元。	After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Obama administration teamed up with the X-Prize Foundation to offer a $1.4 million prize to the group that produced the most efficient oil-recovery solution.
为了扩大融资手段，国家可以通过建立信用局（credit bureaus，发展中国家不常见）和培训和认证产权评估师改善贷款的发放。	To expand access to finance, countries can improve underwriting by establishing credit bureaus, which are uncommon in developing economies, and training and certifying property appraisers.
2014年，欧盟移民和庇护紧急资金总额只有250亿欧元 — — 对于一项集体行动来说，这个数字低得可怜，尽管有来自成员国的资金补充。	In 2014, the EU's emergency funding for migration and asylum totaled a mere €25 million ($28 million) – a pathetic exercise in collective action, albeit one supplemented by funds from member states.
议会发言人比里、真主党秘书长纳斯鲁拉和“自由爱国运动”领袖奥恩对于参与寻求一位新的国家元首犹豫不决。	Parliament Speaker Nabih Birri, Hizbullah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and Michel Aoun, leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, remain reluctant participants in the search for a new head of state.
而虽然很有必要去知道是谁得到了习主席的重用，但我并不觉得这一事件的场景和阴谋论跟它所呈现的那般有趣。	But while it is important to know who Xi’s favorites are, I do not find the theater and intrigue of the event to be as interesting as it is made out to be.
因为长期培养恐怖分子代理组织，巴基斯坦军方已经使其他武装力量在该国根深蒂固，并使圣战文化渗透到每一个角落。	By continuing to nurture terrorist proxies, the Pakistani military has enabled other militants to become entrenched in the country, making the culture of jihad pervasive.
时任乌克兰总统亚努科维奇（Viktor Yanukovych）一逃离基辅，俄罗斯总统普京就开始发动对克里米亚的吞并。	As soon as Ukraine’s then-President Viktor Yanukovych fled Kyiv, Russian President Vladimir Putin began engineering the annexation of Crimea.
对价值550亿美元的投资组合而言，区区3%的收益就将超过该市目前的总收入，而且是波士顿现行资本计划的数倍之多。	A modest yield of 3% on a portfolio worth $55 billion would amount to an income exceeding its current total revenues, and many times more than Boston’s current capital plan.
习近平还强调加强国家治理，特别是要“坚持党对一切工作的领导 ” 、 “坚持全面依法治国 ” 、 及“全面从严治党 ” 。	Xi also emphasized strong governance, specifically “ensuring Party leadership over all work,” “ensuring every dimension of governance is law-based,” and “exercising full and rigorous governance over the Party.”
即便是在2008年全球金融危机之前，中国的年均投资/GDP比率就达到极高的40%水平，而经济学家们也在呼吁向更消费导向的增长形势转型。	Even before the 2008 global financial crisis, China’s annual investment/GDP ratio was running at an exceptionally high 40%, and economists were calling for a transition to more consumption-led growth.
两大基本事实造成了全球经济无解的两难处境，也把诸如阿根廷和希腊的一些国家变成一种“不可能的逻辑”的受害者。	Two fundamental facts have created an apparently insoluble dilemma for the global economy, and have turned countries like Argentina and Greece into victims of an impossible logic.
事实上，这甚至比达成必须涵盖关税、配额、质量标准、特定行业的监管制度以及相关微观经济问题等问题的贸易协定更加困难。	Indeed, it is even more difficult than reaching trade agreements, which must cover issues like tariffs, quotas, quality standards, regulatory regimes for particular sectors, and relevant microeconomic issues.
因此，一种对宗教正统派学说的尖锐而集中的挑战已经出现在一些重要的思想家（如伊朗的阿卜杜卡利姆•索鲁什、突尼斯的阿卜德马吉德•沙非、巴基斯坦的法兹鲁尔•拉曼和苏丹的马赫穆德•穆罕马德•塔哈）的著作之中。	Thus, a sharp, focused challenge to the assertions of religious orthodoxy has emerged in the work of such important thinkers as Abdolkarim Soroush (Iran), Abdelmajid Charfi (Tunisia), Fazlur Rahman (Pakistan), and Mahmud Muhammad Taha (Sudan).
除非欧元区领导人反思这一方针，否则极端政党左翼联盟（Syriza）在最近的希腊大选中获胜将只是欧洲滑向社会分裂和政治动荡过程中的一小步。	Unless eurozone leaders rethink their approach, the radical Syriza party's success in Greece's recent general election could turn out to be just one more step toward a future of social fragmentation and political instability in Europe.
这个争斗的一个方面是，大部分逊尼派穆斯林领导的国家面临着主要是由什叶派穆斯林领导的竞争对手建立区域霸权的挑战。	An aspect of this is that the largely Sunni Muslim-led states face a largely Shia Muslim-led competitor for regional hegemony.
那些负责欧洲日常运作的人，包括欧洲中央银行的委员会，将对欧洲议会负责，而议会也可以因为他们失职而罢免他们。	Those responsible for the EU’s day-to-day operations, including the Board of the European Central Bank, would be accountable to the Parliament, which could dismiss them for failing to carry out their mandates.
希腊的公共债务总额已经相当于该国官方GDP的160 % ， 如果要下降到《马斯特里赫特条约》中公共债务不得超过GDP60%的限制条件估计得花上25年。	Greek public debt today stands at nearly 160% of the country’s official GDP. Suppose Greece took 25 years to bring it down to the Maastricht ceiling of 60%.
虽然现任总司令阿什法克·克亚尼并不像他的前任佩尔韦兹·穆沙拉夫将军那样有着统治巴基斯坦的野心，但军队必须服从而不是凌驾于巴基斯坦的政治领导人。	Army commander Ashfaq Kiyani has shown no interest in taking over the state, as his predecessor, General Pervez Musharraf, did. But the army must accept its subservience to Pakistan’s political leadership.
但历史总是由压倒性的非人力量决定的 — — 如宗教、种族身份和文化态度 — — 这些力量不容于基于武力的解决方案，更不用说外国军队的干预了。	But history is frequently shaped by overwhelming impersonal forces – such as religion, ethnic identity, and cultural attitudes – that are not receptive to solutions based on force, let alone intervention by foreign armies.
然而因为市场信号没有给出正确的刺激，以及各国政府还没有在这方面进行充分的合作以发展及推广新节能技术的使用，在新节能技术上的投资还没有达到足够的规模。	Yet investments in new resource-saving technologies are not being made at a sufficient scale, because market signals don’t give the right incentives, and because governments are not yet cooperating adequately to develop and spread their use.
他们就像被关在一个圆形监狱中，无处躲避可以让他们获得喘息机会（或知道谁能给他们喘息机会）的人的关注。	As if in a Panopticon, they cannot hide from the attention of those who might give them a break (or know others who might).
除非政策制定者们着力实行政治和解与统一—而不是最优的经济政策—这一重中之重，否则任何向和平过渡的进程都会夭折。	Any transition to peace may well prove ephemeral unless policymakers make political reconciliation and integration – not optimal economic policies – the bedrock priority.
埃及总统胡斯尼·穆巴拉克领导的政府审判两名高级法官的决定在埃及国内掀起了一场轩然大波，这两名法官之所以被起诉是因为他们揭露了去年秋天议会选举中的舞弊行为。	The decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s government to try two senior judges for blowing the whistle on vote rigging in last autumn’s parliamentary elections has rocked the country.
首先，它指责中国“强迫技术转让 ” ， 认为美国公司必须拱手交出专利技术和操作系统的蓝图才能在中国开展业务。	First, it accuses China of “forced technology transfer,” arguing that US companies must turn over the blueprints of proprietary technologies and operating systems in order to do business in China.
剩下的两个职位，也就是欧洲议会主席以及容克尔目前担任的“欧洲先生”职务也将会促进总体平衡并且反映2009年年中欧洲议会选举的结果。	The remaining two posts, president of the European Parliament and the “Mr. Euro” job currently held by Juncker, will also have to contribute to overall balance and reflect the outcome of the European Parliament elections in mid-2009.
黎巴嫩南部的真主党武装分子随后又杀死三名以色列士兵并且俘虏了其他两名士兵，并且坚持要求以色列从有争议的领土撤军以及交换几千名被关押的黎巴嫩人。	Hezbollah militants in south Lebanon then killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others, and insisted on Israel’s withdrawal from disputed territory and an exchange for some of the several thousand incarcerated Lebanese.
据莫斯科社会和经济科学学院教授达吉雅娜·沃罗哲伊基娜（Tatyana Vorozheykin ） ， 俄罗斯摧毁阿勒颇让普京多了一项“胜利”可供标榜。	According to Tatyana Vorozheykina, a professor at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences, Russia’s destruction of Aleppo has given Putin another “win” to tout.
德国式的学徒制结合课堂作业和实际操作，可以让参与者在拿工资的同时不断学习，即使对中年失业的劳动者而言也可以成为重要的出路。	German-style apprenticeships combining classroom work and practical work, and enabling participants to earn a salary while learning, could be important solutions even for middle-aged displaced workers.
布鲁塞尔 — — 奥巴马·巴拉克总统在北美以外的第一次露面，即他的伦敦，斯特拉斯堡，布拉格和伊斯坦布尔之行， 引起了全球的关注。	BRUSSELS – President Barack Obama’s first appearances outside North America – in London, Strasbourg, Prague, and Istanbul – galvanized world attention.
2008—2011年的经验表明，全球投资者风险厌恶程度升高会导致流向新兴市场的资本流减少，即使它们并非风险发源地。	As the 2008 and 2011 experiences demonstrate, heightened risk aversion among global investors reduces capital flows to emerging markets, even when they are not the source of risk.
这些有思想的少数派需要一个有效的法律和政府系统，真实的总统选举，有所作为的议会，还有独立的司法体系，而不是仅仅遵从上面的意思。	The thinking minority needs a system of laws and institutions, real presidential elections, a working parliament, and justice that is independent, rather than merely following orders from above.
而谈判的最终失败将导致各主要发达和发展中贸易国的领导人之间硝烟再起，并可能导致全球经济每年减少7000亿美元的额外收入。	Failure would thus constitute a serious indictment of political leaders in major trading countries in both the developed and developing worlds, possibly costing the global economy $700 billion in additional annual income.
相比之下，多边金融机构倾向于强调其董事会中的国家代表性，导致其董事会针对相关经济部门所具备的财务专业知识相对较少。	MFIs, by contrast, tend to emphasize country representation on their boards, leaving these boards with less financial-sector expertise in the relevant sectors.
考虑到当前的经济和政治困局，这种拖延症式的冲动是可以理解的；可这一旦涉及公共养老金，拖延所付出的代价就会极高 — — 甚至比全球变暖的后果更为严重。	The impulse to put things off for a later day is understandable, given current economic and political troubles; but when it comes to public pensions, procrastination comes at a high cost – even more so than in the case of global warming.
第三世界水管理中心（Third World Centre for Water Management）估算，只有大约10—12%的非洲人口能够获得充分的家庭和工业废水收集、处理和排放。	The Third World Centre for Water Management estimates that only about 10-12% of Africa’s population has access to adequate domestic and industrial wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal.
泛太平洋伙伴关系协定(Trans-Pacific Partnership)推进相对较快，其中包含除美国之外的11个国家，合共占全球GDP份额的40 % ， 但重点是并未将中国包括在内。	The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is further along, and involves 11 countries, besides the US, that collectively produce as much as 40% of global output; but China, crucially, is not among them.
如果脆弱国家和国际捐助者将更多资源用于强化幼儿、小学和中学等教育的三大支柱，那么全世界的严重脱轨国家都将最终有机会重新回到轨道上。	If fragile states and international donors directed more resources to strengthening education’s three pillars – early, primary, and secondary – the world’s SOTCs would finally have a chance to get back on track.
一百多万个签名迅速汇至一个互联网上的申诉书，要求日本政府彻底解决遗留化学武器问题，互联网聊天室里这种对日本大张挞伐的言论可谓司空见惯。	One million signatures were rapidly gathered on an Internet petition demanding that the Japanese government thoroughly resolve the chemical weapons issue, while Internet chat rooms filled with anti-Japanese invective.
"我在Lexis-Nexis数据库里搜索了全世界英文报纸中关于""外包 "" 、 ""工作""和""印度""三个关键词的新闻报道。"	"I searched the Lexis-Nexis database of English-language newspaper stories around the world that contained all three of the words ""outsourcing,"" ""jobs,"" and ""India."""
由此造成的财政紧缩加剧了经济不平等，导致很多人跌落到贫困线以下，而很多造成2008年萧条的私营机构却利用公共经费迅速恢复了元气。	The resulting fiscal austerity plunged many below the poverty line and accelerated economic inequality, while many private institutions, having caused the 2008 bust, recovered on the public dime.
确实，如今中央几乎完全操控俄国的国内经济和政治，尽管这不是在一个专制或者集权的框架下，而是在民主和基于市场的形式进行。	Indeed, today the center almost completely dictates Russian internal politics and economics, though not within a totalitarian or autocratic framework, but in a democratic and market-based fashion.
将其与政府的通胀保护债券相比显示出相应的预期通胀率为五年期0.9 % ， 十年期1.3%和三十年期1.7 % 。	Comparing these interest rates with the yields on government inflation-protected bonds shows that the corresponding implied inflation rates are 0.9% for five years, 1.3% for 10 years and 1.7% for 30 years.
非技术性工种工资增长的长期停滞被归咎于低成本、劳动力密集型的进口产品，同时却有意无意地忽视了西方民众对劳动密集型亚洲产品的消费抵消了实际收入增长停滞这种必然的结果。	The longstanding stagnation in wages for unskilled labor was attributed to low-cost, labor-intensive imports, ignoring the corollary that Western workers’ consumption of labor-intensive Asian goods offset the effect on real wages.
埃尔多安继续将库尔德人民民主党视为贱民，而且根本不去考虑与库尔德反政府武装之间达成和平，甚至热衷于重新开战。	Erdoğan continues to treat the HDP as a pariah. And, far from contemplating peace with the Kurdish rebels, he seems to relish the resumption of war with them.
通过提振生产率、增加投资回报和促进技术改造和创新，韩国充分的高教育程度工人成为其出口导向型发展政策的基础。	By boosting productivity, increasing returns on investment, and facilitating technological adaption and innovation, South Korea’s abundance of well-educated workers has served as the foundation for its export-oriented development strategy.
普京还管理着一台非常有效的宣传机器，它炮制了一出后现代主义苏联口号、革命前宗教仪式以及的受“消费主义”西方启发的尖端营销艺术的混成曲。	Putin also manages a highly effective propaganda machine, which churns out a post-modernist pastiche of old Soviet slogans, pre-revolutionary religious rituals, and state-of-the-art marketing ploys inspired by the “consumerist” West.
已经有人要求赞助商，包括麦当劳、维萨、可口可乐、阿迪达斯、百威、俄天然气、起亚和现代，向FIFA和卡塔尔施压，要求它们改善工作条件。	There have also been calls for sponsors, including McDonalds, Visa, Coca-Cola, Adidas, Budweiser, Gazprom, KIA, and Hyundai, to place pressure on FIFA and Qatar to improve working conditions.
如果你认为一个和数个欧元区外围国家应该脱离欧元“休个假 ” ， 那你必定低估了这一事件的经济和政治后果。	Those who argue that one or more countries on the eurozone’s periphery should take a “holiday” from the euro underestimate both the economic and political repercussions of such a move.
这是非常严重的问题，因为再过一年多时间，全世界的领导人将会在哥本哈根聚会，谈判京都议定书失败后的后续条约。	This matters, because in little more than a year, the world will sit down in Copenhagen to negotiate the follow-on treaty to the failed Kyoto Protocol.
由于2008年大崩盘的影响，一些成员国处于过度负债状态，风险溢价导致欧元区永久分裂为债权国和债务国两个阵营。	As a consequence of the crash of 2008, several member countries became over indebted, and risk premia made the eurozone’s division into creditor and debtor countries permanent.
沙特阿拉伯可以和另外一个为圣战主义提供资金的国家卡塔尔断交，但它在也门和伊朗进行着一场残酷的代理战争。 这场战争让也门和伊拉克和利比亚一样，眼看着就要成为一个失败之国。	Saudi Arabia may have fallen out with a fellow jihad-bankrolling state, Qatar, but it continues to engage in a brutal proxy war with Iran in Yemen, which has brought that country, like Iraq and Libya, to the brink of state failure.
还有些人顽强抵抗，而且更加愿意让欧元升值。 这是因为，随着加息不再进行，强势欧元可能是对付他们所担心的通货膨胀的唯一途径。	Some are recalcitrant and are more than willing to see the euro rise because, with rate hikes off the table, the strong euro may be the only way left for fighting the incipient inflation they fear.
要么英国政府连夜宣布退出欧元区，根本不需要公民投票甚至议会投票，要么德国和法国不得不同意立即废除欧洲央行禁止货币融资的禁令。	Either the British government would have, overnight, declared its exit from the euro, without a referendum or even a parliamentary vote, or Germany and France would have had to agree to scrap immediately the ECB’s prohibition of monetary financing.
十多年前，人们开始预测“亚洲世纪”即将出现，其背后的主要动力是不可阻挡的中国，而美国看似不可避免的衰退则提供了助力。	A little over a decade ago, people began to speculate about an emerging “Asian century,” driven by an unstoppable China and enabled by America’s supposed inevitable decline.
我们正在这样做，我们着眼于和美国建立更深化、更“正常”的关系，专注于我们可以共同完成什么，而不是美国可以为我们做什么。	As we do so, we look forward to a deeper and more “normal” relationship with the US, focused on what we can do together rather than on what Americans can do for us.
发自纽约 — — 脸书（Facebook）的联合创始人克里斯·休斯（Chris Hughes）最近指出，公众对脸书的监督“早就该实施了 ” ， 宣称“令人我感到震惊的是，他们之前竟然无需回答更多关于正方面的这些问题 。 ”	NEW YORK – Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, recently noted that the public scrutiny of Facebook is “very much overdue,” declaring that “it’s shocking to me that they didn’t have to answer more of these questions earlier on.”
这些力量包括社会老龄化、不平等性加剧（以收入、财富和机会衡量 ） 、 多个人口细分群体的社会和经济不安全，以及对机构和专家观点失去信任。	These forces include societal aging, rising inequality (in terms of income, wealth, and opportunity), social and economic insecurity among broad segments of the population, and a loss of trust in institutions and expert opinion.
扩大SDR篮子的建议受到了IMF总裁克里斯汀·拉加德的大力支持，预计IMF执委会将在本月底做出最终决定。	The recommendation to enlarge the SDR basket has been warmly backed by Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director, and a final decision by the Fund’s executive board is expected at the end of the month.
这些移民中有三分之二生活在发达国家，即生产率往往是最高的地区，因此他们的工作影响能得到最大化，形成影响深远的经济收益。	Because roughly two-thirds of these migrants reside in developed countries, where productivity tends to be highest, they are maximizing the impact of their work, with far-reaching economic benefits.
这些受过精良训练的人士创造数不清的新技术，包括计算机图形、半导体、网络设备、突破性软件以及互联网本身。	These highly trained people created countless new technologies, including computer graphics, semiconductors, networking equipment, groundbreaking software, and the Internet itself.
受日益恶化的通胀和失业权衡的警示，凯恩斯主义决策者试图通过收入政策维持繁荣 — — 通过国家与工会的协议控制工资成本。	Alert to a worsening tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, Keynesian policymakers tried to sustain the boom through incomes policy – controlling wage costs by concluding national agreements with trade unions.
反对伊拉克战争并且赞成与伊朗直接对话的候选人赢得决定性的胜利无疑将会对美以关系以及和平进程产生关键的影响。	The decisive victory of a candidate who opposed the Iraq war and favors direct talks with Iran will no doubt have a major influence on US-Israel relations and the peace process.
最终，特朗普如何打好美国在以巴冲突中的手牌 — — 美国拥有不可或缺的影响力的唯一一个中东问题 — — 可能取决于当事方之间发生了什么。	In the end, how Trump uses US leverage in the Israel-Palestine conflict – the only issue in the Middle East where the US enjoys such indisputable influence – might depend on events on the ground.
加拿大石油和天然气行业时常会拖动冰山以避免对离岸采油平台造成伤害，但对阿联酋来说，需要将冰山向南拖动10,000多公里，耗时可能长达一年，这绝非易事。	While Canada’s oil and gas industry regularly tows icebergs to avoid damage to offshore platforms, for the UAE, keeping ice intact over a 10,000-kilometer (6,200-mile) southward journey, which can take up to a year, is no easy feat.
这两大危机之间没有任何共同点，但是其解决之道却在很大程度上取决于这两大联合国常任理事国是否动用其否决权。	The two crises have nothing in common, but their resolution will depend in large part on whether these two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council use their veto power.
保护臭氧层的蒙特利尔议定书主要内容是框定有害物质，试图加快除去这些物质，而不是制定一个稳定臭氧层的目标。	The Montreal Protocol for protecting the ozone layer primarily addresses harmful substances, trying to accelerate their phase-out, rather than defining a stabilization target for the ozone layer.
费加罗报上的关于如何缩减自己的开支的一个版面则预测“价值观革命” 的来临，并声称，人们将把家庭放在工作之前。	In the newspaper Le Figaro, a section on how to scale back one’s expenses predicted a “revolution in values” and claimed that people will put family ahead of work.
MILF并没有因为1986年继反对派领袖小贝尼诺·阿基诺（Benigno Aquino, Jr . ） 遇刺而起的群众推翻马科斯20年独裁统治事件而有所退缩。	The MILF was not deterred by the popular overthrow of Marcos’s 20-year dictatorship in 1986, following the assassination of the opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr.
美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马2009年的布拉格讲话确实引起了全球的关注，这次讲话令人信服地强调了建设无核武器世界的重要性。	US President Barack Obama did capture global attention with his Prague speech in 2009, which made a compelling case for a nuclear weapon-free world.
“亚洲四小龙 ” （ 香港、新加坡、韩国和台湾）也在达到类似的相对收入水平后出现了GDP增长放缓的过程。	The “Four Asian Tigers” (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) experienced a slowdown in GDP growth at a similar relative income level.
三年前，在坎昆联合国COP 16气候变化上，各国同意在2020年把排放量降低到足以阻止全球平均气温比工业化之前高2℃的水平。	Three years ago, at the United Nations COP 16 climate-change meeting in Cancún, countries agreed to reduce their emissions by 2020 to a point that would prevent the average global temperature from rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
各央行最先进的宏观经济模型也非常不幸地未能发挥作用 — — 以至于经济学业界当今时今日才开始完全承认的程度。	Central banks’ state-of-the-art macroeconomic models also failed miserably – to a degree that the economics profession has only now begun to acknowledge fully.
1984年，一家位于印度博帕尔（Bhopal）的农药厂泄露了27吨异氰酸甲酯，这是一种用来制造农药的气体。	In 1984, a pesticide-manufacturing plant in Bhopal, India, released 27 tons of methyl isocyanate, a gas used to produce some pesticides.

虽然像美联储前主席保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker）这样的专家都推荐美国进行银行国有化，但是，奥巴马政府却连非常短暂的国有化也不愿意进行，因为它不想因为国有化银行而被贴上“社会主义者”的标签。	But the Obama administration did not want to be tagged as “socialist” for nationalizing banks, however temporarily, even though experts such as former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker had recommended just that.
中国信用泡沫的破裂可能导致随后四年平均GDP年增长率下���至1—2%的水平（假设每年资本支出下降2 % ， 而消费增长率仍能保持在不错的3—5 % ） 。	The collapse of China’s credit bubble would likely cause annual GDP growth to drop to 1-2%, on average, for the subsequent four years, assuming a 2% annual decline in capital expenditure and a still-respectable consumption-growth rate of 3-5%.
近30年前，当美国在冷战结束后成为全球霸主以及软实力这个词被引入时，政治和分析人士并没有对今天控制俄罗斯和中国的政权进行过充分的思考。	Nearly three decades ago, when the United States emerged from the Cold War as a global hegemon and the term soft power was introduced, political analysts did not take sufficient account of regimes like the ones in control of Russia and China today.
但是，取消能源补贴固然对平衡预算、巩固经济基础具有绝对必要的作用，但这些措施也有可能大大影响东乌克兰，而东乌克兰有大量俄裔居民。	But, while abolishing energy subsidies is absolutely essential to balance the budget and put the economy on a sound footing, these steps also risk hitting eastern Ukraine, which contains a substantial Russophone minority, particularly hard.
布鲁塞尔/墨西哥城—2008年全球经济衰退开始以来，争论一直集中在解决危机、创造复苏的宏观经济战略和工具上。	BRUSSELS/MEXICO CITY – Since the global economic downturn began in 2008, debate has centered on the macroeconomic strategies and instruments used to address the crisis and foster recovery.
这不但不能降低风险，反而可能让朝鲜更加大胆地回到用常规手段施压韩国的老路上去，就像2010年其击沉韩国护卫舰、杀害46名水兵并占领韩国岛屿那样。	And, rather than reduce risks, it may embolden the North to return to risky conventional pressure on South Korea, such as in 2010, when it sank a South Korean corvette, killing 46 seamen, and shelled South Korean islands.
但此后，在1949年中国革命和1975—1979年的柬埔寨噩梦之间的那段短暂的时间里，人们有了一个发现：革命越是彻底，就会变得越血腥和野蛮。	But then, in the short span of time between the Chinese revolution of 1949 and the Cambodian nightmare of 1975-1979, a discovery was made: the more radical the revolution, the more bloody and barbaric it becomes.
这不无道理：这个话题范围甚广，从网络空间中的国家行为国际规范到网络犯罪和日益增加的审查等挑战无所不包。	This is to some extent justifiable: The breadth of topics is staggering, ranging from international norms for state behavior in cyberspace to challenges like cybercrime and growing censorship.
当（且仅当）CCS可以成功地得到大规模应用时，中国、印度和美国等依赖煤炭的国家便（才）可以继续使用它们的储量。	If (and only if) it proves successful for large-scale use, coal-dependent countries like China, India, and the United States could continue to use their reserves.
2009年对65位美国总统学者的调查将肯尼迪列为最重要总统第六名；而对英国美国政治专家的最新调查把肯尼迪排在第14名。	A 2009 poll of 65 American presidential scholars rated JFK as the sixth most important president, while a recent survey of British experts on American politics put Kennedy in 15th place.
在法国，国民阵线（National Front）领导人马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）希望凭借民族主义在明年的大选中问鼎总统宝座。	In France, the National Front’s leader, Marine Le Pen, hopes to ride nationalism to power in next year’s presidential election.
当然，对这种灾难的最好保护是加强土耳其的民主系统，而最好的办法就是让它在类似的民主国家中深深地扎根。	Surely, the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey's democratic system, which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries.
在这三个之外，凯恩斯会加上第四条，我们如今称之为“格林斯潘对策 ” — —利用货币政策去将泡沫最高峰时的资产价格合理化。	To these solutions, Keynes would have added a fourth, one known to us today as the “Greenspan put” – using monetary policy to validate the asset prices reached at the height of the bubble.
现在，保卫东正教已成为俄罗斯国家理念的支柱之一，普京要靠此来维护自己政权的合法性。 这一新的政治因素让普京在邀请教皇问题上，更为谨慎。	That wariness is reinforced by a new political factor: a defense of Orthodoxy has become a pillar of the national idea on which Putin seeks to base the legitimacy of his regime.
日本的经验给欧洲带来了重要教训，其中最主要的一个是，刺激政策尽管对于短期支持需求必不可少，但无法解决长期结构性缺陷。	Japan’s experience holds important lessons for Europe, the main one being that stimulus policies, though necessary in the short run to support demand, cannot address long-term structural deficiencies.
此外，必不可少的还有权力集中的银行业监管政策，掌握处理银行危机的生杀大权，并对无法挽救的银行展开清算工作。	Moreover, it must have centralized banking supervisory policies, with strong powers to manage bank crises and to liquidate banks that cannot be rescued.
特朗普面不改色心不跳地高举阶级大旗并吸引 — — 不管多么伪善 — — 穷得买不起车、更不用说把孩子送进哈佛的阶级。	Trump had no compunction to speak clearly about class, and to embrace – however deceitfully – those too poor to buy a car, let alone send their children to Harvard.
1986年以来的30年中，高收入纳税人所得税率大幅提高，从28%增长到39.6 % ， 而他们的投资收益还要额外缴纳3.8%的税收。	In the 30 years since 1986, the tax rates for high-income taxpayers rose significantly, from 28% to 39.6%, with an extra 3.8% tax on these taxpayers’ investment income.
比如，欧盟-加拿大全面经济和贸易协定花了七年时间才谈成 — — 并险些被比利时瓦隆尼亚（Wallonia）地区议会所阻挠。	The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, for example, took seven years to hash out – and was almost scotched by the parliament of Belgium’s Wallonia region.
在欧洲，因为80%的银行资产是由跨国银行集团所持有的，所以危机管理机制必须到位，以应对本质上高度融合的资本市场。	In Europe, crisis management mechanisms must be put in place to manage their deeply integrated nature, as 80% of Europe’s banking assets held in cross-border banking groups.
要想实现绿色能源目标我们必须放弃对不靠谱的太阳能和风能的过时补贴政策，这项政策失败了20年，再过22年仍然不会成功。	To green the world’s energy, we should abandon the old-fashioned policy of subsidizing unreliable solar and wind – a policy that has failed for 20 years, and that will fail for the next 22.
最后，能够以前所未有的低利率借钱的政府（比如，德国可以以0%的真实利率发行10年期以上的国债）应该承担起支持需求的责任。	Last but not least, governments that can borrow at unprecedentedly low rates – 0% in real terms over 10 years in the case of Germany – must play their role in supporting demand.
当其他人指出我们排除了刚果和埃塞俄比亚等人口更多的国家时，我会将埃塞俄比亚比作未来11国之外的索尔斯克亚（Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ） — —英超曼联队1990年代的出色替补得分手。	When others would point out that we had excluded more populous countries such as Congo and Ethiopia, I would muse that Ethiopia could be the N-11’s Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, in reference to Manchester United’s brilliant sub-in scorer during the 1990s.
问题在于一旦灾难来袭政府很可能面对高额成本，也就是说政府要在最必要的时刻为保持财政地位付出更高的期权价值。	The problem is that the government likely faces high costs if a disaster strikes, which implies a high option value to preserving fiscal space for when it is most needed.
美国向玉米农民发放乙醇补贴，但这么做并没有能够达到政客拍胸脯保证的环境目标，却平白消耗了大量谷物，助长了食品价格。	Ethanol subsidies, such as those paid to American corn farmers, do not accomplish policymakers’ avowed environmental goals, but do divert grain and thus help drive up world food prices.
在美国，大约1%的劳动力就能生产足够多的食品为全国人口提供足够的卡路里和必要营养素，而运输和分销这些食品则需要另外1%的劳动力即可。	In the US, roughly 1% of the labor force is able to grow enough food to supply the entire population with sufficient calories and essential nutrients, which are transported and distributed by another 1% of the labor force.
在最近的危机之前，经济学家一直在大谈“大稳健 ” （ great moderation ） ： 经济波动将趋缓，许多人认为经济稳定政策效果达到了新的高度。	Until the recent crisis, economists were talking up the “great moderation”: economic fluctuations were supposedly becoming milder, and many concluded that economic stabilization policy had reached new heights of effectiveness.
此外，明年的经济增长仍将微弱（较之2%或者更高的普遍观点 ） 、 而失业率仍将高企（约为10 % ） ，以致于让我们感到仍然处在衰退之中。	Moreover, growth next year will be so weak (0.5 to 1%, as opposed to the consensus of 2% or more) and unemployment so high (above 10%) that it will still feel like a recession.
如果中国存款减少－如果真像官员们所说的那样执行多样化的储备投资政策－那么谁还有能力为美国每天超过20亿美元的贸易赤字买单？	If China saves less – and if, as officials have announced, it pursues a more diversified policy of investing its reserves – who will finance America’s more than $2 billion a day trade deficit?
两个支柱战略是对我们（依然）缺乏一个连贯并且坚实地包含了经济或基础部门以及货币因素的模型的事实的一个回应。	The two pillar strategy responds to the fact that we (still) lack a model which encompasses both dimensions, the economic or real and the monetary, in a consistent and robust manner.
可是对一个从不相信威慑能对现有核威胁产生作用的国家，现在依靠这种方法实际是一个新的，并不情愿的赌注。	But, for a country that has had little faith in deterrence when it comes to existential nuclear threats, relying on it now would mark a new, uncomfortable bet.
如果这一结构如宣传的那样起效，那么国会必须达成妥协，而要达到妥协，政客就必须再一次说服两极分化的选民以避免更糟糕的结果。	If this structure works as advertised, Congress will be forced to reach a compromise, which can be sold once again by politicians to their polarized constituencies as being necessary to avoid a worse outcome.
最终的成功还取决于世界各国同时实行财政扩张政策，各国的扩张程度应当与其国内财政空间和经常账户状况相对照。	Success also hinges on the simultaneous pursuit of fiscal expansion worldwide, with each country’s efforts calibrated according to its fiscal space and current-account position.
在现有的国家治理体系下，中国的各个部门及地方已经在各自的职权范围内开始解决这些长期积累的经济与社会问题，以创造更平等，更有创新力、及更有适应力的社会。	The current bureaucracy, working within its silos, is already addressing these problems, in order to create a more equitable society that is also innovative and adaptable.
他将他的理论称为“通论 ” ， 以区别于凯恩斯之前的理论。 此前的理论假设一个独特的产出水平 — — 充分就业。	He called his theory “general” to distinguish it from the pre-Keynesian theory, which assumed a unique level of output – full employment.
微软的首席执行官是印度裔，同样情况的还有英特尔奔腾处理器的发明人、摩托罗拉前首席技术官和谷歌的首席执行官。	Microsoft’s chief executive is of Indian origin, as is the inventor of the Intel Pentium processor, the former chief technology officer at Motorola, and the CEO of Google.
由于未能拿出完整的核裁军计划，美国、俄罗斯和其他有核国家正在用不作为把全世界引入不得不使用核武器的未来。	By failing to propose a compelling plan for nuclear disarmament, the US, Russia, and the remaining nuclear powers are promoting through inaction a future in which nuclear weapons will inevitably be used.
对共和党来说，不幸的是他们还没有找到如何取代奥巴马医保的办法，因此他们目前的政策是“撤销并拖延 ” 。	Unfortunately for Republicans, they haven’t figured out how to replace Obamacare, so their current policy is “repeal and delay.”
来自IMF、世界银行、欧洲复兴开发银行和双边贷款人的资金以及来自官方和商业银行债权人的债务豁免帮助该地区缓解了压力。	Financing from the IMF, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and bilateral lenders, along with debt relief from official and commercial bank creditors, helped relieve the pressure.
事实上，尽管关于欧元区生存的担忧总是集中在债务国，但欧洲货币联盟的风险是失去仅有的几个仍保有3A新用评级的成员国之一：芬兰。	In fact, while concerns over the eurozone’s survival tend to focus on its indebted members, Europe’s monetary union is at risk of losing one of the few members that still enjoys a triple-A credit rating: Finland.
他们认识到，他们的国家的债务减少取决于名义经济增长，而它们的经济增长前景 — — 更不用说持续和平了 — — 取决于世界的复苏。	They recognized that their countries’ debt-reduction prospects depended on nominal economic growth, and that their economic-growth prospects – not to mention continued peace – depended on a worldwide recovery.
在20年前的中东欧地区，一场全面的变革要求人们抛弃，更换或者重新建立所有的政治和经济体制；这意味着把全部整个社会的“硬件”换一遍。	In Central and Eastern Europe 20 years ago, comprehensive change demanded that all political and economic institutions be discarded, altered, or built anew; a complete change in society’s “hardware” was required.
相反，它们的基础是因为对美国和欧洲所坚持的过时特权的共同不满 — — 这些特权降低了布雷顿森林机构的信誉和效率。	Instead, they are founded on a shared frustration with the outmoded entitlements to which the US and Europe are clinging – entitlements that are diminishing the Bretton Woods institutions’ credibility and effectiveness.
但事实上事情往往无法如预期般推进，而这也正是为何在制定央行的目标时应该为政策制定者在极端事件发生时留出灵活性 — — 或者是违反规则的高度抽象性许可。	The fact that things often do not work out as expected is precisely why central banks’ objectives should be written to give policymakers flexibility – or poetic license to bend the rules – when extreme events occur.
实际上，从我在前任总统Chernyenko的葬礼上作为苏共总书记首次露面起，就曾说过每个国家都对自己的政治负有责任。	Indeed, from my first appearance as General Secretary of the USSR, at the funeral of my predecessor, Constantine Chernyenko, I said that every country should be responsible for its own politics.
但美国总统特朗普的政府和（不像特朗普政府那么好斗的）欧盟委员会一直宣称德国的高盈余肯定意味着总需求相对供给而言比较萎靡引起的宏观经济失衡。	Yet US President Donald Trump’s administration and (less pugnaciously) the European Commission continue to push the narrative that Germany’s high surplus must indicate a macroeconomic imbalance caused by low aggregate demand, relative to supply.
如果低于正常趋势的增长持续下去，货币政策很可能会耗尽解决这一问题的手段，尤其是如果尾部风险 — — 经济，金融，政治和地缘政治 — — 也对复苏构成了影响的时候。	If below-trend growth continues, monetary policy may well lack the tools to address it, particularly if tail risks – economic, financial, political, or geopolitical – also undermine recovery.
最重要的是，尽管依赖债务让金融机构风险增加，但债权人知道，危机来袭时政府可能会援助最大的金融机构（如果不是所有金融机构的话 ） 。	Most important, while reliance on debt made financial institutions riskier, creditors knew that, in a crisis, the government would probably bail out the largest, if not all of them.
该集团在美国也类似有类似的作为，就是利用其自身企业媒体力量来向一个长期孤立的政治组织 — — 茶党 — — 打强心针。	In the US, it has behaved similarly, using corporate media power to breathe life into a stand-alone political organization, the Tea Party.
随着中国和印度等石油进口国加入美国的石油大买家行列（尤其是中东石油 ） ， 原油价格已经飙升到100美元一桶。	Oil prices have surged to more than $100 per barrel, as China, India, and other oil-importing countries join the United States in a massive scramble to buy up supplies, especially from the Middle East.
上月末，正当我们的《Haykakan Zhamanak 》 （ 《亚美尼亚时代报 》 ） 进入新一期收尾工作时，办公室外传来爆炸声。	Late last month, while putting the finishing touches on the next edition of our newspaper, Haykakan Zhamanak (The Armenian Times), we heard an explosion outside our office.
但有一个问题：让经济回归增长的宽松货币政策正在达到极限，现在，它们有可能在为新的金融危机创造条件，对复苏起到干扰作用。	But there’s a hitch: the easy monetary policies that have largely enabled economies to return to growth are reaching their limits, and now threaten to disrupt the recovery by creating the conditions for another financial crisis.
现在，中国就像一家公司的股东，而这家公司却暗中增加了自身股票的供应：因此虽然现在这家公司还维持着自身的股价，但总有一天会跌的。	China is like the shareholders of a company that has increased the supply of its shares in a stealthy way: the share price may not have fallen yet, but it will.
特朗普在臭名昭著的“走近好莱坞”录像带发布不久后举行的选举中得到了众多女性的支持，而特朗普在录像中吹嘘自己犯下各式各样的性侵丑闻。	Trump gained a strong plurality from women in an election held shortly after the release of the notorious “Access Hollywood” tape, on which Trump was heard boasting about sexual assaults he had committed.
而这些举措在法国造成了自相矛盾的结果，不管那些反全球化的言论说得多么动听，这里的麦当劳是全欧洲最受欢迎的。	This produces paradoxical results here in France, where – despite all the anti-globalization rhetoric – McDonald’s is more popular than anywhere else in Europe.
所谓的TARGET2余额常常用来表示资本外逃情况：有可能放弃欧元的国家的投资者也许会将资金转移到德国。	These so-called TARGET2 balances are often taken as a sign of capital flight: investors in countries at risk of abandoning the euro might be tempted to transfer their funds to Germany.
从极度紧俏的美国劳动力市场中得出的第二个结论是，与前段时间那种国内工资压力受全球价值链压制的低失业状况不同，由于全球价值链抵消作用变弱，因此对当今不断上升的工资通胀的舒缓作用也较小。	The second conclusion to draw from an extremely tight US labor market is that, unlike earlier periods of low unemployment when domestic wage pressures were constrained by GVCs, today’s mounting wage inflation will be tempered by a smaller GVC offset.
前者要求进一步一体化，但这样做的经济副作用可能抑制后者加入欧洲货币联盟（这也是制度竞争不可能永远压制的又一信号 ） 。	As the former press on with greater integration, the adverse economic consequences of doing so are likely to deter the latter from EMU participation (which may be another sign that institutional competition cannot be suppressed forever).
中国通过建立强大的劳动密集型工业基础、将工人从农业转移到制造业和建筑业以及改善全部门生产率实现了农业经济的转型。	China transformed its agrarian economy by building a strong, labor-intensive industrial base, shifting workers from agriculture to manufacturing and construction, and improving productivity across all sectors.
4月，匈牙利总理维克托·奥尔班在将竞选活动的重点放在所谓由穆斯林移民造成的对“基督教价值观”的“威胁”后，成功赢得了压倒性的胜利。	In April, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán won a landslide election victory after running a campaign that focused on the “threat” to “Christian values” supposedly posed by Muslim immigrants.
这一分析呼吁最彻底的行动：发展一套资源 — — 特别是财富和权力 — — 均匀分配的经济和社会制度。	This analysis calls for the most radical action: to develop an economic and social system in which resources, particularly wealth and power, are more evenly distributed.
坎布里奇 — — 自从年内早些时候就任总统以来，巴拉克·奥巴马就将首要的立法重点放在了改革美国医疗体系的筹资方式上。	CAMBRIDGE – Since assuming the presidency earlier this year, Barack Obama’s primary legislative focus has been on reforming the financing of American health care.
但令人吃惊的是，在美国、欧洲、印度，中国和其他大部分地区，人们更倾向于认为自己是某一国的公民，而不是属于某一当地社区。	But, strikingly, national identity overshadowed even local identity in the United States, Europe, India, China, and most other regions.
出于这些原因，我提出一个较为中庸的观点。 我预测，到2030年，中国平均潜在GDP增长率将下降至5—6 % 。	For these reasons, I take a more moderate view, predicting that China’s average potential GDP growth will fall to 5-6% by 2030.
事实上，考虑到贸易协定的复杂性 — — 包括对难以量化的非关税壁垒的强调 — — 这些估算可能非常不准确。	In fact, given the complexity of the trade agreement – including the emphasis on hard-to-quantify non-tariff barriers – these estimates are likely to be highly imprecise.
我们无法确定选举观察团在韦德最终承认败于萨尔的结果中起到了什么作用，但知道选举正在接受地区监督一定集中了他的精力。	We cannot be sure what impact the mission had on Wade’s ultimate decision to concede defeat to Sall, but knowing that the region was watching must have focused his mind.
在这种情形下，监管者就不能袖手旁观了，因为如果越来越多的市场参与者都这么想的话，就会造成连锁反应，一旦出了问题，局面不可收拾，金融系统由此就会崩盘。	Regulators, by contrast, cannot ignore these imbalances, because if too many participants are on the same side, positions cannot be liquidated without causing a discontinuity or, worse, financial collapse.
相反，KRG试图打造库尔德走廊直通地中海必然会遇到阻力，不但来自土耳其，也将来自其他叙利亚战斗派系。	In contrast, any attempt by the KRG to establish a Kurdish corridor to the Mediterranean would certainly meet resistance, not only from Turkey, but also from other warring factions in Syria.
意大利贝卢斯科尼政府对待罗姆人定居点的手段 — — 拆毁他们的住房，只因为他们是罗姆族裔就要求其留下指纹 — — 公然践踏了人权。	In Italy, the Berlusconi government’s treatment of Roma settlements – destroying homes and fingerprinting Roma based solely on their ethnicity – blatantly violated human rights.
实际上，西奈的贝多因人有权使用却无权占有土地，因为行事昏庸、不时贪污腐化的政府似乎把西奈看作一块军事领地，根本不相信西奈人对国家的忠诚。	Indeed, Sinai Bedouins have the right of use but not ownership of land, because a lethargic, occasionally corrupt bureaucracy still deems the Sinai a military zone and its natives’ loyalty questionable.
在共和党候选人竞争中领跑的唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）一再建议沿着墨西哥边境全线建立一座墙。	The Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, has repeatedly proposed building a wall along the entire border with Mexico.
2015年杰伊·瓦格纳和安托尼·法格为国际新闻研究所提交的一份报告用“琐碎”来形容许多近期案例，并把民事诽谤法视为发泄“个人不满”的渠道。	A report in 2015 by A. Jay Wagner and Anthony L. Fargo for the International Press Institute describes many of the recent cases as “petty” and regards the civil libel law as a better recourse for “personal grievances.”
如今，随着俄罗斯入侵乌克兰、吞并克里米亚（显然是因为害怕乌克兰深化其与欧盟和北约的联系 ） ， 这一可能性甚至想都难以想象。	That possibility is difficult even to consider today, after Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea (apparently carried out in response to fears that Ukraine would deepen its ties with the European Union and NATO).
如果欧洲人决心要以统一的声音讲话，要在多边体制中从联合国安理会开始推举出统一的代表，那么他们的意见将会得到更多的关注。	If Europeans were to set for themselves the goal of speaking with one voice, of having one representative in the spectrum of multilateral institutions – starting with the UN Security Council – they would be taken more seriously.
中东问题四方(美国、俄罗斯、欧盟以及联合国) 过去向来被视为“三加一 ” 。 但是，现在已经不是这样了。	The Quartet (the US, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations) used to be regarded as “One plus Three,” but that is no longer the case.
自从萨尔瓦多在1992年结束了长达10年的内战以来，保守的共和联盟党一直统治着这个国家，为阻止马解阵线赢得大选，该党用尽了一切手段，甚至再次用上了给人扣红帽子的各种把戏。	The conservative ARENA party, which has governed El Salvador since the country’s 10-year civil war ended in 1992, did everything possible to prevent an FMLN victory, resorted, once again, to every red-baiting trick in the book.
如果退休基金和政府都无法为老年人提供养老金，那么整个欧洲大陆的各国可能面临日益严重的社会动荡 — — 即希腊闹剧的放大版。	If pensions and governments both prove unable to provide for the elderly, countries across the continent could experience rising social instability – a broader version of the saga playing out in Greece.
更糟糕的是，新天然气生产往往不能取代煤炭，而是会取代风能和太阳能项目，后两者现在在许多地区已经比煤炭和天然气更加便宜。	Worse, new gas production often displaces not coal, but wind- and solar-energy projects, both of which are now cheaper than coal and gas in many regions.
人口稀少的澳大利亚捐助额是美国的两倍，日本比美国高出50 % ， 而欧洲承诺的金额也达到了美国的5倍。	Lightly populated Australia offered more than twice America’s assistance, Japan promised almost 50% more, and Europe pledged more than five times as much.
而体现中国影响力的则是国有的中国国家开发银行和中国工商银行在2016年向巴基斯坦提供了9亿美元的紧急援助，帮助其政府避免或至少推迟了向国际货币基金组织求助的计划。	Illustrating China’s leverage, in 2016 the state-run China Development Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China provided $900 million of emergency assistance to Pakistan, helping its government avoid, or at least delay, recourse to the IMF.
首先，它从联合国人口基金（UNFPA）中撤资。 UNFPA是为难民受人道主义危机影响的和其他妇女提供生殖保健和家庭规划服务的联合国机构。	For starters, it has withdrawn funding from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN agency that provides reproductive health-care and family-planning services for refugees and other women affected by humanitarian crises.
在这场对抗中，国际可信性和合法性将是决定性因素，确保具备可信性和合法性将需要美国进行富有远见、冷静清醒、恰到好处的领导。	In this confrontation, international credibility and legitimacy will be the deciding factors, and ensuring them will require far-sighted and cool, calculated American leadership.
在最近关于电子窃听的汹涌民意中，谁可以获得个体的个人数据必须由个体自己决定这一概念显得特别有号召力。	Amid the current furor over electronic eavesdropping, the notion that individuals should decide who can access their personal data is particularly appealing.
相反，中国与印度等其它新兴经济体的成长是能够为全球再平衡做出贡献的，并可以真正加强全球经济和地缘政治的稳定性。	On the contrary, China – along with other emerging economies, such as India – can contribute to a global rebalancing that actually strengthens economic and geopolitical stability.
但这种处事方式在美国共和党，特别是其茶党派系看来无异于一种诅咒，他们可能让被中国日益增长的军事实力弄得紧张兮兮的众多亚洲人丧失勇气。	But such approaches are anathema to the US Republican Party, and to its Tea Party faction in particular, and they might unnerve the many Asians who are nervous at China’s growing military might.
SLCP包括黑炭或油烟（颗粒物质的主要成分，也是日益严重的重大健康威胁 ） 、 氟氢碳化物（HFC，冰箱中最常用 ） ； 以及甲烷和对流层（或地面）臭氧。	These include black carbon or soot (the primary component of particulate matter that is also a major and growing health concern); hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), used most commonly in refrigeration; and methane and tropospheric (or ground-level) ozone.
在本世纪初那几年，投资者们赌人民币升值，在2004~2006年间又押注资产价格升值，导致短期资本开始流入中国。	In the early 2000s, short-term capital began to flow into China, with investors betting on the renminbi’s appreciation and, from 2004-2006, on rising asset prices.
我告诉他们说我方已经将过渡国民议会视为新的合法政治对话方，并准备好给予相应支持，但我方希望得到的回报则是过渡国民议会能向着建立透明民主政府的最佳标准迈进。	I told them that we considered the TNC to be our new legitimate political interlocutors in Libya and were ready to support them, but that in return we expected the TNC to work towards the best standards of transparent democratic government.
当时全球正面对两位数的通胀忧心不已，而该理论的出世恰恰为央行行长采用那些极为不受欢迎的行动提供了借口。	The theory’s publication at a time of worldwide alarm about double-digit inflation offered central bankers exactly the pretext they needed for desperately unpopular actions.
柏林—德国持续的高经常项目盈余问题也许不在本周汉堡G20峰会的正式日程上，但它必然会在参会的领导人中间制造紧张态势。	BERLIN – Germany’s persistently high current-account surplus may not be on the official agenda of this week’s G20 summit in Hamburg, but it is bound to provoke tensions among the assembled leaders.
但是，税收以及福利以外的原因也造成欧元区经济体的三大国的低就业率，也就是较高的最低工资以及就业保护法律的某些特征减缓了工人通过就业市场的流动。	But factors beyond taxes and benefits also contribute to low employment rates in all the three major euro-zone economies: high minimum wages and some features of employment protection legislation slow down the flow of workers through the job market.
2010年，文特里亚公司向美国食品药品监管局（Food and Drug Administration，FDA）申请承认这些蛋白质“总体安全 ” （ 一个艺术性的监管用词 ） ， 结果没有得到��何回复。	When Ventria approached the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010 for recognition that these proteins are “generally recognized as safe” (a regulatory term of art), it received no response.
由于英国本身是一个资本输入国，因此我们可以猜测，伦敦并不是自己持有这些债券，而是通过简单地重新包装这些债券，然后为这些债券取个印有伦敦盖章的新名字，然后转售到世界其他地方。	Since the United Kingdom itself is a large capital importer, we can assume that the City is not holding the paper itself but merely restructuring it and then selling it to the world under a new name and with the London stamp on it.
无论哪里的初创企业均有助于创造就业机会、提升竞争力、提高生产率和促进经济增长，而且有助于减少贫困和应对气候变化。	Startups anywhere contribute to job creation, competitiveness, higher productivity, and economic growth, while helping to reduce poverty and fight climate change.
耶伦不仅理解金融市场和货币政策，也理解劳动力市场 — — 在失业和工资增长停滞成为主要担忧的时期，这是至关重要的。	Yellen brings to bear an understanding not just of financial markets and monetary policy, but also of labor markets – which is essential in an era when unemployment and wage stagnation are primary concerns.
这个董事会的成员，其职位独立于各国政府，任期也设置得相当长，整个董事会就像一个中央银行的货币政策委员会那样运作。	Its members, with statutory independence and long terms in office, could function like the monetary policy committee of a central bank.
以1990年代初的波斯尼亚冲突为例，当时安理会决定只派出联合国维和部队，而不是按照《联合国宪章》第七章所允许的方式部署更强大的多边武装。	Consider the Bosnian conflict in the early 1990s, when the Security Council decided to send in UN peacekeepers, rather than deploying a more robust multilateral presence, as would have been allowed under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.
但阿巴斯外交策略最大的失败之处是，即使成功了也看不到有形的好处，这会损害他在巴勒斯坦人心中的信誉，加强哈马斯的政治影响力。	But the ultimate failure of Abbas’s diplomatic strategy – the absence of tangible benefits even if it succeeds – will damage what is left of his credibility among the Palestinians and strengthen Hamas’s political clout.
但对任何超越纯粹自卫范畴的国际军事行动来说，其合法性都要得到国际社会的广泛认可¾缺乏合法性的军事行动注定难逃失败的厄运。	But the legitimacy of any international military action that goes beyond immediate self-defense requires broad international approval - and action without legitimacy is bound to fail.
尽管以色列总理奥尔默特在2007年沙姆沙伊赫峰会上作出了值得称赞的姿态，但是峰会的成果注定是短命的。	Notwithstanding Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s commendable gestures at Sharm el-Sheikh in 2007, the summit’s achievements are bound to be short-lived.
在这方面，英国像极了日本人：越来越少的年轻人学外语、出国留学，然后沿着传统老路去香港、新加坡和澳大利亚工作。	Here the British are very much mimicking the Japanese: fewer and fewer are learning foreign languages, studying abroad, and following the old path of working in Hong Kong, Singapore, or Australia.
对日本真实发展的更深入了解可以从另一个来源得出：联合国统计委员会发布的最新国际统计标准 — — 新的2008年版国民经济计算准则。	More insights into Japan’s real progress can be derived from another source: the new System of National Accounts 2008, the latest international statistical standard for national accounting by the United Nations Statistical Commission.
但完全是对一段复杂历史的过度简单化解读 — — 与其说这段历史是一段宗教冲突史，不如说它更具有同化和共存的特征。	This is a highly simplistic interpretation of a complex history – one characterized far more by assimilation and co-existence than by religious conflict.
这需要对免疫接种工作、改进数据收集和分析方法以及新工具和新方法展开进一步的投资，而且最重要的是，需要建立强有力的伙伴关系来支持这项工作。	This will require further investment in immunization, improved data collection and analytics, new tools and approaches, and most importantly, strong partnerships.
这应该视为特朗普对相对较穷的州的农村选民和中西部锈带城市选民的背叛，他们最需要联邦政府的帮助来免于破产和保持健康。	This should be seen as a betrayal of many Trump voters in the rural areas of relatively poor states and the Rust Belt cities of the Midwest, where people most need the federal government’s help to remain solvent and healthy.
左派鼓吹退出是否明智取决于摆脱欧盟机构的民族国家是否能提供更加肥沃的土壤培育再分配、劳动权利和反种族主义的进步日程。	Whether it makes sense for leftists to advocate exit hinges on whether a nation-state freed from EU institutions provides more fertile ground for cultivating a progressive agenda of redistribution, labor rights, and anti-racism.
在经历了长达十年的经济不景气后，选民们对给出经济增长和生活水平提高等生硬承诺的主流政治家持怀疑态度。	After a decade of economic malaise, voters are skeptical of mainstream politicians who offer rote promises of growth and improved standards of living.
即便如此，监管机构也必须承担此项任务：一旦他们采取什么行动，市场就会有相应的反馈，他们可以根据反馈作出相应的修正。	Even so, financial authorities must accept the assignment: while they are bound to be wrong, feedback from the markets will tell them whether they have done too much or too little. They can then correct their mistakes.
NPT是将世界有核国家数量限制在当前的九个，而不是一代人之前人们普遍担心的20—30个的唯一最重要的原因。	The NPT has been the single most crucial factor in limiting the world’s nuclear-armed states to the current nine, rather than the 20-30 widely feared a generation ago.
美国第一任财政部长亚历山大·汉密尔顿认为，允许成本更低的进口品涌入会阻碍国内“婴儿”产业的发展，后者需要时间扩大规模从而将成本削减至有竞争力的水平。	Alexander Hamilton, the first US treasury secretary, argued that allowing lower-cost imports would impede the development of domestic “infant” industry, which needed time to scale up enough to reduce costs to a competitive level.
历史证据 — — 更别提当年日元贬值的经验教训 — — 表明在人们感知到货币贬值的积极影响之前往往要经历数个季度，甚至数年。	Historical evidence, not to mention Japan’s experience with a falling yen, suggests that it takes several quarters, or even years, before the positive impact of currency depreciation on net exports is felt.
中国官方与谷歌公司的冲突，以及美国对美方目标遭到网络攻击的抗议提醒了外界以及美国的媒体和政治精英们：两国价值观之间的差异究竟有多大。	China’s clash with Google and US protests at cyber attacks on American targets remind the outside world, as well as America’s media and political elites, of the difference in values between the two countries.
可持续发展目标4 — — 到2030年确保平等包容的教育 — — 是可以实现的，但解决方案必须要“接地气 ” ， 即要接入最渴望教育的非洲人民这个“地气 ” 。	Sustainable Development Goal 4 – to ensure equitable and inclusive education for all by 2030 – is attainable, but only if solutions come from the ground up, which means from the Africans most committed to them.
他的西班牙同行佩德罗·桑切斯（Pedro Sánchez）则更进一步，任命了一个女性人数超过男性的内阁。	His Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez has gone a step further, appointing a cabinet where women outnumber men.
事实上，他已经表示要对欧洲汽车实施进口关税 — — 特别是宝马和奔驰 — — 以帮助美国汽车制造商，尽管这会伤害美国消费者。	Indeed, he has already pledged to impose tariffs on European cars – targeting, in particular, BMW and Mercedes – to help US car producers, even though this will also hurt American consumers.
但只要想一想权力在加密货币“矿工 ” 、 交易所、开发者和财富所有者手中大量集中，就能看出区块链与去中心化和民主根本无关；它只和贪婪有关。	But one need only consider the massive centralization of power among cryptocurrency “miners,” exchanges, developers, and wealth holders to see that blockchain is not about decentralization and democracy; it is about greed.
历史上从未有哪个经济体经历过如此大规模、如此快速的增长，因此，用邓小平的话说，管理中国发展的唯一办法是“摸着石头过河 ” 。	Because no economy had ever experienced such rapid growth on such a large scale, the only way to manage China’s development was, as Deng put it, to “cross the river by feeling the stones.”
此外，在哈马斯与埃及穆斯林兄���会关系密切的问题上（隶属于后者的政党将穆尔西推上了总统宝座 ） ， 以色列也保持了克制，没有对来自加沙的恐怖主义和火箭袭击反应过激。	And, in view of Hamas’s close links with Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, whose political party backed Morsi’s successful presidential run, Israel has restrained its response to terrorist and rocket attacks from Gaza.
此外，针对某些在第一次公投中导致选民投反对票或弃权票的议题，爱尔兰政府还从其欧盟伙伴处得到了法律保证。	In addition, the Irish government secured legal guarantees from its EU partners on the issues that most concerned voters who voted No or abstained in the first referendum.
同样，过度关注那些“不死巨兽”将引发一种新的危险思维，认为只要我们能找到并纠正一些关键的市场失灵行为，那么我们就至少能维持一个稳定而且能够自我平衡的系统。	There is therefore a danger that excessive focus on “too big to fail” could become a new form of the belief that if only we could identify and correct some crucial market failure, we would, at last, achieve a stable and self-equilibrating system.
太多观察家仍沉迷于美国国会中的传统党派分歧，而没有关注更深层次的人口变化，而这一变化很快就将成为决定性因素。	Too many observers remain fixated on the traditional party divides in the US Congress, not on the deeper demographic changes that will soon be decisive.
1933年，美国通过田纳西流域管理局法案（Tennessee Valley Authority Act ） ， 成立了一个负责沿田纳西河建造水电站的机构。	In 1933, through the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, the United States established an agency whose purpose was to build hydroelectric dams on the Tennessee River.
在垃圾堆里工作的儿童容易发生皮肤和呼吸系统的问题，那些与油漆打交道的儿童最终会对他们吸入的有毒物质上瘾。	Children who work in the garbage dumps are prone to skin and respiratory problems, while those who work with paints eventually become addicted to the intoxicants that they inhale.
往好了说，这种批评堪称睁眼说瞎话；往坏了说，它可能会导致亟待进行的，目的包括确保发放生产性而非政治性贷款的银行业改革停滞不前。	This criticism is disingenuous at best. At worst, it could bring to a grinding halt much-needed banking-sector reforms aimed at, among other things, ensuring productive, rather than politically motivated, lending.
放眼全球，带着尚未独立的子女的母亲平均而言收入要少于没有未独立子女的妇女，也要少于具备类似家庭和就业特征的父亲。	Around the world, mothers with dependent children earn, on average, less than women without dependent children, and less than fathers with similar household and employment characteristics.
它只是取消了一个很小的中间机构，几乎无人为它惋惜的美国储蓄管理局（Office of Thrift Supervision ） ， 同时又加上了另一个 — — 消费金融保护局（Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ） ， 现任政府非常不喜欢这个机构，让人担心它还能存在多久。	It abolished only one small agency, the unlamented Office of Thrift Supervision, and added another, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a body so little loved by the current administration that one wonders about its longevity.
那些通过援助有效的卫生服务，建造干净饮用水设施，为儿童接种麻疹疫苗而实现了儿童死亡数目下降的人们却依然默默无闻。	The people who contributed to this drop by delivering effective basic health care, building a supply of safe water, or immunizing children against measles remain largely unknown.
比如说证券化可以帮助在适当的框架下降低风险并增加风险借款人的可动用信贷额，但2008年全球金融危机明显表明，如果过度使用这一手段就可能意味着巨大的成本。	Whereas securitization, for example, can help to reduce risk and increase the availability of credit for risky borrowers under the right framework, the 2008 global financial crisis starkly demonstrated that it can imply huge costs if it goes too far.
做得好的公司将能够以更低的成本设计更好的产品；但只有当它们能够跨越国界和行政区来比较数据时才能取得显着的效果。	Companies that do this well will be able to design better products, at lower costs; but they will achieve significant gains only if they can compare data across borders and jurisdictions.
Sandarmokh是发展最好、最重要的俄国纪念地，但遗憾的是，即便是邻近的斯堪的纳维亚人也不清楚它的存在。	Sandarmokh is the most important, and best developed, Russian site of memory. Unfortunately, it is unknown even to neighbors as close as the Scandinavians.
相反，重商主义则提供了一个合作主义的视角 — — 政府与私人企业是盟友，并为追求共同的目标 — — 例如国内经济增长或国家实力 — — 而合作。	Mercantilism, by contrast, offers a corporatist vision in which the state and private business are allies and cooperate in pursuit of common objectives, such as domestic economic growth or national power.
因此，我们应该更加相信俄罗斯普京的话，而不是叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的话；更相信美国总统特朗普的话，而不是普京的话。	So one should prefer Russian President Vladimir Putin’s account to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s, and US President Donald Trump’s account to Putin’s.
因为即使在在实施“有限核部署”之后可以及其幸运地避免核冲突失控升级，也只需要一枚战术武器就可以产生与广岛和长崎核爆相当的破坏。	Even in the highly improbable event that an uncontrolled escalation could be avoided after “a limited nuclear employment,” one tactical weapon alone could generate an explosion comparable to those that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
年轻人不会因为父辈的文化被西方忽略而成为原教旨主义者，相反，原教旨主义的虔诚既是个人行为，也代表了一个时代对父辈宗教信仰的反抗。	Young people do not become fundamentalists because their parents' culture is ignored by Western civilization. Fundamentalist religiosity is individual and generational, a rebellion against the religion of one's parents.
"此外，本次投票人数只占到了登记选民总数的57 % 。 投票之前，欧洲安全与合作组织就说""公众对这次选举的兴趣似乎并不高 "" ， 还有其它专家提到了""选民疲劳症 。 """	"Turnout was relatively high, at 57% of registered, particularly given that the OSCE had intoned that ""public interest does not seem to be high""; other experts wrote of ""voter fatigue."""
作为总理默克尔的新执政大联盟新任命的内政部长，他试图让自己也举起民粹主义的大旗，包括在内政部的名称中恢复Heimat（祖国 ） 。	And as the recently instated interior minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s new grand coalition government, he has sought to burnish his own populist credentials, including by restoring the word Heimat (homeland) to the ministry’s name.
第七，将财政赤字货币化在短期内不会导致通货膨胀，同时，生产和劳动力市场的疲软意味着巨大的通货紧缩压力。	Seventh, monetization of fiscal deficits is not inflationary in the short run, whereas slack product and labor markets imply massive deflationary forces.
在2005年，Hadjiev一家的汽车被一种类似于炸弹的装置烧毁。 他们将此事件解释为让其停止对保加利亚—及可能对土库曼—当局的挑战的警告。	In 2005, the Hadjievs’ car was incinerated by a bomb-like device, which they interpreted as a warning to cease their defiant challenges to the Bulgarian – and possibly Turkmen – authorities.
此外，最近一些新的科技进展更加促进了磷虾的捕捉。 比如说真空泵，它使得一只捕鱼船就能捕捉和加工极大数量的磷虾，每个季节超过12万公吨。	Moreover, krill fishing has recently been fueled by new technological advances such as vacuum pumps, which allow a single fishing vessel to catch and process huge amounts – up to 120,000 metric tons per season.
在这里，我不同于其他许多经济学家，包括我的好朋友约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz ） 、 让-保罗·费托西（Jean-Paul Fitoussi）和弗拉基米尔·柯文特（Vladimir Kvint ） — —他们喜欢使用生活质量标准。	Here I differ with many economists – including my dear friends Joseph Stiglitz, Jean-Paul Fitoussi, and Vladimir Kvint – whose preferred standard is the quality of life.
唯有在思考和行动过程中始终不忘这一战胜一切差异的基本练习，唯有培养跨越世代的普世团结，我们才能真正在前路上迈出扎实的步伐 。 ”	Only by thinking and acting with constant concern for this underlying unity that overrides all differences, only by cultivating a sense of universal intergenerational solidarity, can we set out really and resolutely on the road ahead.”
利用更多的资源和优化的治理架构，东盟+3宏观经济研究室可以在区域经济监测上扮演一个更加有效的角色，而且也无须承担一个可能由金融安全网相关的道德风险。	With greater resources and an improved governance structure, AMRO could play a more effective role in regional economic surveillance and monitoring, without which moral-hazard risks associated with financial safety nets would rise.
不计国企及地方债务，中国的政府总债务/GDP之比只有53 % ， 远低于美国的80%和日本的226 % ， 因此有充足的空间采取债务-股本互换来解决内债问题。	With China’s total government debt/GDP ratio amounting to only 53% – much less than America’s 80% and Japan’s 226% – there is sufficient space to undertake debt-equity swaps to tackle the internal-debt problem.
如果各国对危机都无动于衷，那么我们就面临危险，即重返20世纪30年代大萧条时的政治与经济的悲哀，那次危机最终让世界陷入一种毁灭性的冲突之中。	If collective inaction prevails, we risk a return to the political and economic woes of the 1930’s, which paved the way to a devastating world conflict.
而德国公司部门仍不愿再国内借钱和投资，因为它们看不到长期经济增长的希望，这又是因为人口即将减少且生产率增长停滞不前。	Yet Germany’s corporate sector remains reluctant to borrow and invest in the country, because it sees little reason to expect long-term economic growth, given that the population is set to decline and productivity gains remain anemic.
联合国安理会的制裁是方向正确的一步，但还不够，因为它没有禁止向朝鲜供给原油，而这显然是因为中国和俄罗斯的反对。	The UN Security Council sanctions are a step in the right direction, but they are not enough, as they do not ban supplies of oil to the North, apparently due to Chinese and Russian opposition.
接下来几周将会最终解决巴尔干半岛留下的最后的领土问题，不管是以哪种方式。 二十世纪九十年代在那里发生的战争最终导致了北约1995年在波斯尼亚、1999年在科索沃的介入。	The next few weeks will see the resolution, one way or another, of the last territorial issues remaining in the Balkans, where the wars of the 1990’s ended with NATO interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999).
由于美国当前的储蓄不足状况在去年不合时宜的减税时点下进一步恶化，美国只能更加依赖中国这样的盈余储蓄者来填补空缺。	With America’s saving shortfall now worsening in the aftermath of last year’s poorly timed tax cuts, the US will only become more reliant on surplus savers like China to fill the void.
与此同时，美国所支持的跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership，TPP）也在北京取得了进展。	Meanwhile, the US-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) also moved forward in Beijing.
《华盛顿邮报》为读者提供了对一个名叫奥马尔·卡德尔（Omar Khadr）的未成年的加拿大人的刑讯审问录像报道，奥马尔·卡德尔展示了他仍然流着血的腹部伤口，哭泣着向抓捕他的人求饶。	The Washington Post gave readers actual video footage of the abusive interrogation of a Canadian minor, Omar Khadr, who was seen showing his still-bleeding abdominal wounds, weeping and pleading with his captors.
诚然，它仍是世界第八大经济体，人均收入大约为26,000欧元，毛储蓄率也较高，为GDP的18 % 。	To be sure, it remains the world’s eighth-largest economy, with a per capita income of roughly €26,000 ($29,300) and a relatively high gross savings rate of 18% of GDP.
事实上，事故发生短短几年后，驾直升机空中调研的白俄罗斯科学家所搜集的废弃区域资料已经表明野猪、麋鹿和狍子的数量明显上升。	Indeed, as early as a few years after the accident, data collected by Belarusan scientists flying helicopter surveys over the abandoned area showed rising numbers of wild boar, elk, and roe deer.
此外，韩国需要对产业集中度进行检视，政府应该花大力气提供激励、确保资本获得渠道和降低市场进入壁垒以支持新领域的中小企业成长。	A review of industrial concentration is warranted, as is a major government effort to foster SME growth in new ventures by offering incentives, ensuring access to capital, and lowering barriers to market entry.
而在这样的情况下，核不扩散和裁军事业 — — 这个美国已经为之努力了近70年的目标 — — 将几乎陷入绝境。	With that, the cause of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament – a goal that the US has pursued for almost 70 years – will be all but dead.
西方民主国家的摇滚迷听滚石、地下丝绒（Velvet Underground）和弗兰克·扎帕的发明母亲（Frank Zappa’s Mothers of Invention）等乐队是为了找乐子。	Rock fans in Western democracies listened to groups like the Rolling Stones, the Velvet Underground, or Frank Zappa’s Mothers of Invention, for pleasure.

他不仅支持李森科的理论，还相信出于顽固的意识形态而坚持共产主义统治能够克服自然定律的工程师和地质学家。	He not only supported the Lysenko theories, but also believed ideologically hardened engineers and geologists who insisted that the rules of communism could defy the laws of nature.
在这样一个如此之多的国家似乎执意修墙的时刻，目睹巴尔干修筑沟通的桥梁既颇具讽刺意味，又令人感到深深的满足。	At a time when so many countries seem intent on building walls, it would be ironic and deeply gratifying to see the Balkans build bridges.
在他们的各项努力中，最重要的便是为金融衍生品（即导致金融危机中AIG和其他机构倒闭的金融工具）设立清算所。	Central to their effort has been to bolster clearinghouses for derivatives – instruments that exacerbated the implosion at AIG and others in the last financial crisis.
如果不是拯救计划提供了债务社会化，瓦鲁法基斯（或其他任何希腊财政部领导人）都不得不宣布破产，然后直面来自各个国家的私人债权人。	Without the socialization of debt provided by the rescue packages, Varoufakis, or whoever led Greece’s finance ministry, would have had to declare insolvency and then confront private creditors from a variety of countries.
以色列害怕制裁行动失败可能导致美国接受与装备了核武器的伊朗共存的现实，就像冷战时期接受与苏联共存一样，这种担心并不是完全没有依据的。	Israel ’s fear that the failure of sanctions might bring the United States to accept coexistence with a nuclear-armed Iran in the way it did with the Soviet Union during the Cold War is not entirely unfounded.
只有代表最初提名政党竞选的候选人才被允许竞选连任，独立候选人、公民投票和全民公决的授权法律仍不甚明确。	Reelection is permitted only for candidates nominated by the same party for which they originally ran, and the enabling legislation for independent candidates, ballot initiatives, and referenda remains unclear.
20世纪80年代初，四位工党的叛逆者因为工党的左倾倾向和反欧盟立场，而脱党另立社会民主党（SDP ） 。	In the early 1980s, four defectors from Labour, alarmed by their party’s leftward shift and anti-EU stance, created the Social Democratic Party.
黎巴嫩的传统政治阶级可能不会喜欢这些，但是，正如其中越来越多的人所意识到的那样，建立一种全新的总统制度势不可挡。	Lebanon’s traditional political class may not like it, but, as more of its members are now recognizing, the momentum for a new kind of presidency will not be stopped.
通过承诺在更长时期内采购超过必要购买量更多的俄罗斯天然气，欧盟实际上是在资助俄罗斯构建其军事力量，而这堪称对欧洲和平的直接威胁。	By committing to buy more Russian gas than necessary, and for a longer time, the EU would be helping to finance Russia’s military build-up, which represents a direct threat to peace in Europe.
其次，实际增长保持萎靡并低于潜在趋势，原因在于痛苦的去杠杆化过程还在继续 — — 先是美国，然后是欧洲，现在是高杠杆新兴市场。	Second, actual growth has been anemic and below its potential trend, owing to the painful process of deleveraging underway, first in the US, then in Europe, and now in highly leveraged emerging markets.
将这样的问题不是作为穆斯林的问题，而是作为其解决方法能提升欧洲社会建立基础的价值的问题来处理，人们具有共同的责任。	There is a collective responsibility to treat such problems not as Muslim issues, but as problems whose solutions will enhance the values on which European society is based.
随着衰退的继续恶化，许多背负着过高的债务以及没有足够流动资金的杠杆收购会像利润越来越低或亏损越来越高的公司一样无法偿还它们的贷款。	With a worsening recession, many LBOs that were loaded with too much debt and not enough equity will fail as firms with lower profits or higher losses become unable to service their loans.
最重要的是，默克尔终于可以着手处理近几年来被搁置一旁的重要问题了，目前的组阁协议对这些问题光说不练。	Most important, Merkel could finally tackle the important issues that have fallen by the wayside in recent years, to which the current coalition agreement pays only lip service.
但我们同时也应该对另一个在押的中国异见分子给予同样关注，他在中国司法系统中的困境与刘晓波类似 — — 且更深刻地揭露了所谓许可之下的异见的界限。	But we ought to pay equally close attention to another jailed Chinese activist, one whose plight at the hands of China’s justice system is just as troubling as Liu’s – and far more revealing of the boundaries of permissible dissent.

黎巴嫩反抗叙利亚霸权的斗争日益激烈，但这只是叙利亚需要解决的四个问题之一，在上述四个方面，叙利亚所作的努力都远远不够。	Growing opposition to Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is but one of four related problems Syria faces, all of which it has addressed inadequately.
金本位制时代 — — 伴随着资本自由流动以及开放贸易 — — 在1914年突然终止，并且在第一次世界大战后也没能得到恢复。 我们将要见证另一个类似的全球经济崩溃吗？	The gold standard era – with its free capital mobility and open trade – came to an abrupt end in 1914 and could not be resuscitated after World War I. Are we about to witness a similar global economic breakdown?
他们没有领会1980年耶路撒冷法（Jerusalem Law）的精神。 耶路撒冷法宣布了该市 — — “保持统一完整状态 ” — —成为以色列首都实际上没有带来统一。	What they fail to grasp is that the 1980 Jerusalem Law, which declared the city – “united in its entirety” – to be Israel’s capital did not actually result in unity.
在近年来经历了快速增长和发展的东亚地区，政策制定者不仅允许，甚至鼓励企业赚取更高利润，只要后者能转向生产性投资。	In East Asia, which has experienced rapid growth and development in recent years, policymakers have not only allowed, but encouraged, higher corporate profits, so long as they are channeled into productive investments.
伊斯兰国在地面战争中损失越大、失去的叙利亚和伊拉克领土越多，他们就越有动机将战争扩大化，以防止进一步的干预。	The more the Islamic State is defeated on the ground and loses control of territory in Syria and Iraq, the more it is tempted to externalize the war to deter further intervention.
麦克法登已准确地找到了的全球化挑战的核心解决方案：那就是赋予民众“谋取全球化世界利益的工具 ” ， 从而使“高度互联的世界更好地为人们服务 ” 。	McFadden has pinpointed the central solution to globalization’s challenges: giving people “the tools to reap the benefits” of the globalized world, thereby making the “connected world work better for people.”

即使它最终在6月采取量化宽松，步子也不会很大，因为欧洲央行行长德拉吉及其团队不愿采取可能惊动他们的政治主子的大手笔。	If it finally turns to quantitative easing in June, it will take only baby steps down this path, because ECB President Mario Draghi and his team remain reluctant to embrace the kind of radical measures that would shock their political masters.
在美国，刚上任的共和党总统米特·罗姆尼在随后进行的艰苦拼搏的竞选运动中嘲笑奥巴马对中国经济政策的态度太软弱了。	In the US, President Mitt Romney has just taken office, following a hard-fought campaign in which he derided Barack Obama for being too soft on China’s economic policies.

更糟糕的是，根据原告所诉，尽管任何国家对外部伙伴的债务被限制在该国资本权重之内，但这一限制并不适用于其他签署国。	Worse, according to the plaintiffs, although the liability of any country vis-à-vis external partners is limited to that country’s share of capital, this limitation does not apply to other signatory states.
如果我与任何哪怕受过中等教育的伊斯兰国支持者辩论该组织是否忠实于伊斯兰教的教义，我都很可能没有胜机。	If I tried to get into a debate with any moderately well-educated Islamic State supporter about whether that organization is true to the teachings of Islam, I would lose the argument.

“如果民主的价值、人权的尊重、法治的精神不能得到完全的承认和尊重，就不可能建立任何战略合作伙伴关系 。 ”	Some profess to be “sick and tired of dealing with Brussels bureaucrats.” As Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Russian Duma’s foreign relations committee, put it, “In Germany, Italy, France, we can achieve much more.”
对私营企业施加什么样的激励是很关键的，如果这种激励违背社会利益，其结果将是过度冒险、过度短视和创新怪胎。	Private incentives matter, and if they are not well aligned with social returns, the result can be excessive risk taking, excessively short-sighted behavior, and distorted innovation.
2014年斯德哥尔摩双边谈判期间，金正恩政府同意开始新一轮调查，条件是调查开始后日本同意解除部分制裁。	During bilateral talks in Stockholm in 2014, the Kim regime agreed to pursue a new investigation, in exchange for Japan’s agreement to lift some sanctions once the inquiry began.
最后，他必须毫不含糊地向安理会表明，面对某些事件无动于衷或熟视无睹的做法既违背了《联合国宪章 》 ， 也是一种不作为之罪。	Finally, he must make clear to the Security Council, in no uncertain terms, that its inaction or complacency is inconsistent with the UN Charter and constitutes a crime of omission.
顶尖大学教授今天要想脱颖而出并非依靠对真实世界的正确判断，而是靠想象力来扭曲理论、或者发掘新的证据。	Professors at the top universities distinguish themselves today not by being right about the real world, but by devising imaginative theoretical twists or developing novel evidence.
比如，如今尚无碳的全球价格刺激全球投资从化石燃料转向可再生能源；但我们知道，要想将全球变暖幅度限制在2℃界限内，这一价格很快就会出现。	For example, today there is no global price on carbon to shift energy investment from fossil fuels to renewable sources; but we know that, in order to keep global warming below the 2º limit, such a price is coming soon.
据穆尔西阵营的说法，政治化的宪法法院倾向于解散咨询委员会（议会上院）和制宪大会，这是一些法官公开暗示的。	According to the Morsi camp, the politicized Court intended to dissolve the Consultative Council (the upper house) and the Constitutional Assembly, as some of its judges publicly hinted.
由于社会福利人为地给非熟练工人创造了高工资，并同步引发了过度的移民和失业问题，西欧福利国家已经经历了三十年的非直接移民。	Western Europe has already experienced three decades of indirect migration into the welfare state, as social benefits have created artificially high wages for the unskilled, simultaneously fueling excessive immigration and unemployment.
刘鹤最近被提拔为国家发展和改革委员会副主任，该机构专责为国务院提供关于经济发展策略和宏观经济政策方面的建议。	He has recently been promoted to the post of Deputy Director of the National Development and Reform Commission, the principal body that advises the State Council on economic-development strategy and macroeconomic policy.

新西兰最近退出的“维基储蓄”以及英国2007年的养老金法案同样也基于雇员自动参加，但有自由退出条款。	New Zealand’s recent “KiwiSaver” plan and the United Kingdom’s Pensions Act of 2007 are similarly based on automatic enrollment for employees with free opt-out provisions.
毕竟它才刚刚上台，在国内民望甚高，并处在一个实际上可以做些好事的位置，同时也正在挑战一系列亟需改革的财政规则。	After all, it is still very new, is domestically popular, is in a position actually to do some good, and is challenging fiscal rules that needed to be reformed anyway.

而中国的二氧化碳排放中有超过70%来自工业，光是钢铁生产就消费了国家能源资源的18 % ， 几乎是全中国所有家庭消费量的两倍。	In China, more than 70% of emissions come from industry. Steel production alone consumes 18% of the country’s energy resources, nearly twice as much as all Chinese households.
众议院议长保罗·瑞恩（Paul Ryan）和其他人支持采取边境调节税，即对美国公司所销售的商品所产生的现金流征税，不论产品产自何处，而出口可以免征。	House Speaker Paul Ryan and others favor moving to a border adjustment tax that would tax corporate cash flows regardless of where the goods sold by US companies are produced, while exempting exports.
用奥巴马本人的棒球比喻来说，追求可以实现的上一垒和二垒安打常常比在实现本垒打和被震出局之间大幅波动更有效。	To use Obama’s own baseball metaphor, aiming for achievable singles and doubles is often a more effective strategy than swinging wildly in an effort to hit a home run, only to strike out.

可以肯定，煤炭行业已协助数十亿人摆脱贫困，尤其以中国为首，20世纪90年代以来燃煤发电已支撑人均收入实现近700%的增长。	To be sure, the coal industry has helped billions of people escape poverty, not least in China, where coal-fired power has underpinned the nearly 700% growth in per capita income since 1990.
尽管也门在地理位置上归属于阿拉伯半岛，但却由于国土面积的原因被排除在海湾合作委员会之外 — — 也门是半岛上人口最为稠密的国家 — — 这本来应该是增加也门影响力的砝码。	Although Yemen is geographically part of the Arabian Peninsula, it was excluded from the Gulf Cooperation Council, primarily because its size – it is the most populous state on the peninsula – would have given it great influence.
即便是那些采取控制通胀政策且誓言要令本国货币汇率上升的国家 — — 巴西、哥伦比亚，秘鲁和智利 — — 也都采取了相关措施，而且购买的金额都相当庞大。	Even countries that practice inflation targeting and have otherwise vowed to let their exchange rates float – Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Chile, for example – have done it, and in large quantities.
与西方估计不同的是，中国国内互联网检查制度大多数并不是由政府网络警察执行的，而是由中国网页托管公司落实的。 这些公司对其用户发表的言论负有法律上的责任。	Contrary to Western expectations, most of this domestic Internet censorship is carried out not by the government's Internet police, but by Chinese Web hosting companies, which are being held legally responsible for what their users publish.

而特朗普的重要商界票仓 — — 塔吉特（Target）和沃尔玛等依赖进口的零售商 — — 将强烈反对。	And an important part of Trump’s business constituency – import-dependent retailers like Target and Walmart – are actively hostile.
因此，中国还需要与美国合作，保持外交方面的努力，达成关于如何稳定朝鲜半岛局势、消除军事冲突风险的共识。	Given this, China would also need to engage with the US in sustained diplomatic efforts to reach a consensus on how to stabilize the Korean Peninsula and eliminate the risk of a military conflict.
如今，叙利亚的痛苦事实是政府从内部崩溃很可能导致种族灭绝，增加几百万流离失所者，伊斯兰国也有可能在大马士革建立所谓的哈里发。	The painful truth in Syria today is that a government implosion would most likely lead to genocide, millions more displaced people, and the establishment of the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate in Damascus.
没有数据，我们就不会知道吸烟引起肺癌和冠心病，不会知道头盔能降低摩托车事故的死亡率，不会知道改善妇女教育状况能增加儿童存活率 — — 这样的例子不胜枚举。	Without it, we wouldn’t know that smoking causes lung cancer and coronary disease, that helmets reduce death rates for motorcycle accidents, and that better education for women improves child survival – and much else.
没有任何一个欧盟成员国的政府愿意邀请这样的一个政府加入俱乐部。 它包括了罗马尼亚远比勒彭和 海德更为不堪的人物。	No EU government will want to invite into the club an administration that contains Romania's far uglier version of Le Pen and Haider.
要弱化这种抵制，其中的一条途径就是不但让政府的部长和领导们相互交流政策设计的信息，同时让那些抵制变革的人，尤其是工会也参与进来。	One way to weaken this resistance is to involve not only ministers and heads of government in exchanging information on policy design, but also those who resist change, notably trade unions.
我在建立国际刑事法庭以及现在暂停死刑的奋斗中所学到的一大的教训就是，很多时候退而求其次往往要好一点。	One big lesson I learned during the struggle to create the International Criminal Court (ICC), and now during the battle for a moratorium on the death penalty, is that it is often better to aim for a realistic result rather than a perfect one.
不幸的是，他的春风得意将不可避免地引起人们的经济反思，而这将冲击显然是毫无戒心的法国公民，也将给法国精英“建设欧洲”的计划蒙上一层阴影。	Unfortunately, his streak of success will inevitably call forth an economic reckoning that will shock France’s apparently unsuspecting citizens and doom the French elite’s approach to the “construction of Europe.”
希腊的问题比韩国还要糟糕，在如今正在谈判中的86亿欧元援助计划之前，已经在2010年和2012年进行了1,100亿欧元和1,300亿欧元规模的援助。	In Greece, the problem is even worse, as the €86 billion ($94 billion) plan now under discussion follows a €110 billion bailout in 2010 and a €130 billion rescue in 2012.
绝不可能会有很多英国人因为仰望了纳尔逊的雕像，或途径了牛津奥里尔学院，就会收到启发进而支持奴隶制或在非洲构建一个帝国。	It is highly unlikely that many British people gazing up at Nelson on his column or passing Oriel College, Oxford, will be inspired to advocate slavery or build an empire in Africa.
美国可以通过改善教育系统、提高储蓄率和对过去投资项目的投资、修补降低就业和利润的税收和转移支付系统来增加未来增长率。	The US can increase its future growth rate by improving its education system, raising its rates of saving and investment to where they were in the past, and fixing the features of its tax and transfer systems that reduce employment and earnings.
它仍然拥有高度创新的经济，每年注册的新专利数超过所有欧洲国家的总和 — — 日本在这方面仅次于美国，比中国和印度领先好几个世纪。	It retains a highly innovative economy, which registers more new patents each year than all European countries combined – second only to the US and eons ahead of China and India.
最后，我敦促在消灭其他大规模杀伤性武器及限制导弹、太空武器和传统武器方面取得更大的进步 — — 要想建设一个无核世界，所有这些进步都非常必要。	Finally, I am urging progress in eliminating other weapons of mass destruction and limiting missiles, space weapons and conventional arms — all of which are needed for a nuclear-weapon-free world.
目前，世界经济正处于动荡之中，台湾和中国大陆及亚洲地区其他伙伴国之间的正式经济联系就显得更为重要，只有大家共同努力，才能将危机的损害降到最低。	At this time of economic turmoil around the world, increasing Taiwan’s formal economic links with China and its regional partners can only benefit everyone involved, because an inevitable side-effect will be a lessening of tension.
如果被大数据损害的民众没有追索途径，那么就像数据学家凯蒂·奥尼尔在其最新著作数学武器毁灭中所展示的那样，将有可能带来影响深远的有害结果。	When people who are harmed by Big Data have no avenues for recourse, the results can be toxic and far-reaching, as data scientist Cathy O’Neil demonstrates in her recent book Weapons of Math Destruction.
1915年，一百多万土耳其亚美尼亚人因为在战时“不忠”而被杀或逃入叙利亚沙漠九死一生，但他们一直受到密集的国际审视、研究和宣传。	But at least the fate of the more than one million Turkish Armenians killed outright or death-marched into the Syrian desert in 1915 for their wartime “disloyalty” remains the subject of immense international scrutiny, research, and advocacy.
基金主要由私营部门的专业人士组建，其中许多人已经实现了高水平的私营部门共同投资，从而扩大了可用于基础设施投资的资金池。	Staffed primarily by private-sector professionals, many have achieved high levels of private-sector co-investment, thereby expanding the pool of capital available for infrastructure investment.
不出所料，阿根廷的干预通过了之前说到的三项测试：市场协调失败，而通过由适当机构执行的公共政策而得到有效解决。	Unsurprisingly, the intervention in Argentina passed all three tests: the market suffered a coordination failure that was addressed effectively through public policy carried out by appropriate institutions.
美国退休人员协会无疑是实力强劲的倡导者：其成员的关注 — — 至少是该协会版本的成员关注 — — 往往能够抵达政府最高层。	The AARP is surely a powerful advocate: its members’ concerns – or at least the AARP’s version of those concerns – are often taken into account at the highest levels of government.
如果一名首席执行官无法赢得他的领导团队的尊重，那么他就无法领导公司取得成功，即使大部分员工认为他很了不起。	If a CEO can’t command the respect of his leadership team, he can’t lead the company to success, even if most of the employees think he’s great.
奥巴马担任总统、加之中国的崛起、非西方移民知名度大增和女权主义的挑战，显示出世界发生了多么大的变化。	Obama’s presidency, along with the rise of China, the visibility of non-Western immigrants, and the challenges of feminism, showed how much the world has changed.

教皇约翰保罗二世公开宣称他对进化论基础科学的支持，罗马天主教主教非常支持在基于科学依据之上限制人类活动引起气候变化。	Pope John Paul II declared his support for the basic science of evolution, and Roman Catholic bishops are strongly in favor of limiting human-induced climate change, based on the scientific evidence.
葛兰自我流放地生活在宾夕法尼亚州，并在宾夕法尼亚主持着一个由跨越五大洲的学校、智库、企业和媒体组成的巨大的地下网络。	Gülen lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, where he presides over a huge informal network of schools, think tanks, businesses, and media across five continents.
克里米亚曾是俄国一部分的吞并理由根本站不住脚，因为如果同样的理由在其他地方适用，相当于认可欧洲大部分地区可以凭武力重新绘制边境版图。	Crimea was annexed on the spurious grounds that it had once been part of Russia – a justification that, if applied elsewhere, could underwrite the violent redrawing of boundaries in much of Europe.
在2010年12月被IMF理事会批准之前，已在G-20首尔峰会上达成一致的这一改革方案被称为“历史性”突破。	Prior to its approval by the IMF Board in December 2010, the reform, agreed at the G-20 Seoul Summit, had been hailed as a “historic” breakthrough.

但在某种程度上说，两部影片都是年度最有口碑影片，两部影片都抓住了如今俄罗斯和美国可能开始新冷战的实质。	Yet both, in a way, are the most representative films of the year, as each captures the essence of why Russia and the United States now seem doomed to wage a new Cold War.
在其1873年的作品《伦巴第街》中，英国商人兼《经济学家》的编辑沃尔特·白芝浩( Walter Bagehot ) ， 完美地描述了这种周期。	In his 1873 book Lombard Street , Walter Bagehot, the British businessman and editor of The Economist , described these cycles perfectly.
相反，自然发生的传染病爆发时不时就会发生，且代价更加高昂，即使它们并不具备引起轰动的生化恐怖主义的“恐慌因子 ” 。	Naturally occurring outbreaks, by contrast, occur regularly and are far more costly, even if they lack the sensational “fear factor” of bioterrorism.
这份资产负债表十年后给人的感觉也许会有所变化，但此时此刻，多数美国人认为怀疑者所言有理，并进而影响到美国当前的外交政策。	Perhaps this balance sheet will look different a decade from now, but at this point most Americans have concluded that the skeptics are right, and that thinking has influenced current US foreign policy.
对金融市场的影响将是破坏性的，无论美联储是大幅收紧货币政策以防止物价上涨还是坐视经济“火热”一两年，允许通胀加速。	The impact on financial markets will be disruptive, regardless of whether the Fed aggressively tightens monetary policy to pre-empt rising prices or lets the economy “run hot” for a year or two, allowing inflation to accelerate.
普京尖锐地向听众指出，东乌克兰在沙皇时代被称为“Novorossiya ” （ 新俄罗斯 ） ， 显然，如今那里可以再次成为Novorossiya。	Putin pointedly reminded listeners that eastern Ukraine was called “Novorossiya” (New Russia) in Czarist times, clearly implying that it could be Novorossiya again.
事实上，欧洲专利局（EPO）从未特别关注过评估其所授专利的道德影响问题；在它看来，只有发明真正离谱的极端情况才涉及破坏“公共秩序”的问题。	In fact, the European Patent Office (EPO) is not particularly committed to assessing the moral implications of the patents it grants; in its view, “ordre public” would be violated only in the extreme case of a truly outrageous invention.
作为1970年代受雇于美联储的经济学家，我亲眼目睹了大通胀（the Great Inflation，几乎贯穿整个1970年代的美国经济危机）的诞生 — — 以及笨拙无能的央行在这场危机的催生中所扮演的角色。	As a staff economist at the Fed in the 1970s, I witnessed first-hand the birth of the Great Inflation – and the role played by inept central banking in creating it.
显而易见，执政的法律和正义党并没有意识到这是一种讽刺，因为恰恰波兰移民是引发英国和其他国家对抗情绪的根源。	Apparently, the ruling Law and Justice party does not see the irony that it is Polish immigrants who have been the source of antagonism in Britain and elsewhere.
上述干预措施通常目的是协助代理政治势力战胜其军事政治对手，而不是为避免人道主义灾难或在战后建设非暴力的冲突解决机制。	Such interventions were usually aimed at empowering a proxy political force over its military and political rivals, instead of averting humanitarian disaster or institutionalizing a non-violent conflict-resolution mechanism following a war.
现在，美国使用微型无人航天器进行“逼近操作 ” （ proximity operations ） ： 接近其他卫星而不引起它们的主意。	The US now uses an unmanned miniature version of the space shuttle to practice “proximity operations”: approaching other satellites without harming them.
这一公式可能包括销售额、薪资和有形资产等要素（就像加拿大和美国那样 ） ； 或者是计算不包括出口的增加值，以便衡量各国所“产出”的增值部分。	The formula could include such factors as sales, payroll, and tangible assets, as in Canada and the United States, or value-added, adjusted to exclude imports in order to measure the value-added “produced” in each country.
特朗普肯定知道此举能换取来自国内钢铁和铝产地的潜在政治收益，还能在重新谈判《北美自由贸易协定》的过程中对加拿大和墨西哥两国施加压力。	Trump no doubt sees potential political gains in steel- and aluminum-producing districts and in increasing the pressure on Canada and Mexico as his administration renegotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement.
然而，同是这个人，作为古巴内部安全机器的首脑，多年以来代表着一个铁腕政权的威力，直接对监禁—并时常折磨—成千的持不同政见者负责。	However, this is the same man who, as the head of Cuba’s internal security apparatus, for many years represented the knuckles of an iron-fisted regime, directly responsible for imprisoning – and often torturing – thousands of dissidents.
顶层10%能够轻松获得高等教育，让他们的孩子获得与他们一样的特权；而底层90%必须加倍努力才能付得起高昂的学费，通常他们毕业的时候便已经负债累累。	The top 10% have easy access to higher education that will enable their children to have the same privileges as them; the bottom 90% must work much harder to cover sky-high tuition fees, and typically graduate with a heavy debt burden.
1832年《改革法案 》 （ Reform Act）授予财产不少于10英镑的个人投票权 — — 平心而论标准不低，但已足以让中产阶级获得选举权。	The 1832 Reform Act gave the vote to individuals with at least £10 of property – not an inconsequential sum, to be sure, but low enough to enfranchise the middle class.
另外一个结果就是欧洲各国的管理竞争可能会加剧，因为在税收或管理环境不那么有利的情况下，本地利益不再能约束公司继续把总部设在“本国 ” 。	Another consequence is that regulatory competition is likely to increase in Europe, as companies are less bound by local interests to keep their headquarters at “home” if the tax or regulatory environment becomes unfavorable.
的确，在世界的许多地方，这样的经济改革已经妨碍了经济增长和政府的推动作用，同时在其他方面增加了总体的不平等。	Indeed, in much of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government, while otherwise increasing overall inequalities.
多年来，雀巢一直因在发展中国家推广婴儿配方而饱受诟病，因为这些地区的女性往往可以母乳喂养，且比人工喂奶更加健康。	For many years, Nestlé was criticized for marketing infant formula in developing countries, where breast-feeding was available and much healthier than bottle-feeding.
在其他民主国家，国旗可以自由地印在衬衫、鞋子、胸罩甚至内裤上而不受惩罚，但在印度，任何艳俗的小玩意儿都是对庄严的国旗的玷污。	Whereas in other democracies, flags are used freely and harmlessly on t-shirts, boots, bikinis, and even underwear, in India, the majesty of the flag can, it seems, be tarnished by any tawdry manufacturer of gewgaws.
如今，采取非军事强制手段已经无法再取得很好的效果，尽管安理会威胁要将暴行 — — 包括任何使用化学武器的行为 — — 送上国际刑事法庭不能取消。	It is too late now for non-military tools of coercion to have much effect, although Security Council threats of International Criminal Court prosecution for atrocity crimes – including any use of chemical weapons – must remain on the table .
政治家们无需具备经济学家的头脑就能理解他们所听到的建议，更可况其中许多人还是博学多才，饱读诗书之辈。	Political leaders need not be economic geniuses to understand the advice that they hear, and many are both intelligent and well-read.
但随着科尔认识到戈尔巴乔夫是认真的，他立刻祭出了构建信任战略，与戈尔巴乔夫建立了紧密的个人关系。 如果没有戈尔巴乔夫，欧洲冷战地图就绝不可能和平地发生改变。	But as Kohl recognized Gorbachev’s seriousness, he hurriedly applied his trust-building strategy and established a close personal relationship with the man without whom no peaceful change of Europe’s Cold War map would have been possible.
而如果全世界要用尽一切手段去对抗气候变化的话，那么所有上述相关气体的排放也都必须得到科学评价，并予以立刻处理。	If the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change, emissions of all substances that contribute to it must be scientifically evaluated and urgently addressed.

尽管没有人怀疑正义与发展党知道包括数百名将军在内的案件受害者遭到诬陷，但因为害怕被贴上居伦“平行集团”的标签，所以没有几个土耳其人敢站出来讲话。	While there was no doubt that the AKP knew that the victims of the lawsuits, including hundreds of generals, were framed, few Turks said a word, for fear of being labeled part of Gülen’s “parallel state.”
到20世纪80年代，阿萨姆邦学生仍因为对失去土地和工作机会的前景感到怒不可遏而举行大规模抗议活动，抗议活动偶尔会导致暴力冲突的爆发。	By the 1980s, Assamese students – angry at the prospect of losing land and job opportunities – were staging mass protests, which occasionally erupted into violence.
但乌克兰的抵抗力度和国际社会防止暴力为所欲为的能力取决于世界领导人是否明白绥靖只会引发进一步的侵略。	But Ukraine’s ability to resist, and the international community’s ability to prevent brute force from having free rein, depends on whether world leaders understand that appeasement begets only further aggression.
因此，即使我们需要公司提供越来越多的重要服务 — — 从交通到医疗和疏散计划 — — 但我们对它们的信任越来越少。	So, even as we need companies to provide more and more vital services, from transportation to health care to evacuation plans, we trust them less and less.
为取代特朗普政府的这种做法，中国应该考虑与澳大利亚、加拿大、欧盟、日本、墨西哥和新西兰合作考虑与特朗普政府开展新一轮WTO谈判。	In lieu of such an approach by the Trump administration, China should consider launching a new round of WTO negotiations in cooperation with Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and New Zealand.
这意味着你根本不了解情况，或者更有可能你出于某些理由希望德国大都市位于距离坦帕（Tampa）两小时船程的地方 。 ”	It means you have absolutely no clue, or more likely, have some reason you want a major German metropolis to be a two-hour boat ride from Tampa.”
这两种类型的企业在同一个低迷经济中的共存状况催生了一种意想不到地下交易的机会 — — 否则的话��数的企业可能永久关门。	The coexistence, in the same depressed economy, of these two types of businesses gives rise to unexpected opportunities for shadowy trades without which countless businesses might close their doors permanently.
战后秩序早在1941年就开始形成，当时美国总统富兰克林·罗斯福和英国首相丘吉尔在一艘停泊在加拿大普拉森西亚湾的船上起草了《大西洋宪章 》 。	The postwar order had begun to take shape as early as 1941, when US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill drafted the Atlantic Charter on a ship anchored in Canada’s Placentia Bay.
在最近访问非洲时，我听到了一个令人痛心的故事，那里的妇女和新生儿常常被医院扣为人质 — — 时间往往长达数月 — — 直至家属能够凑钱结清账单为止。	On a recent trip to Africa, I heard a harrowing story of a hospital where women and their newborns are routinely held hostage – often for months – until families can find the money to settle their bills.
相反，曼德拉领导的南非政府认为国家的多样性是长期统一和福祉的潜在资源，决心采取令人瞩目的包容性方针。	Instead, the Mandela-led government recognized the country’s diversity as a potential source of long-term unity and wellbeing, and decided to pursue a remarkably inclusive approach.
尽管绝大部分新产妇能够母乳，但并非所有妇女都能产生足够的母乳，原因包括疲倦、抑郁或产后手术导致的身体虚弱。	Even though the majority of new mothers are able to breastfeed, not all women can produce enough milk, owing to exhaustion, depression, or physical weakness following postpartum surgery.
Lamentablemente, la crueldad del azar también está al centro de los siglos de desconfianza entre Polonia y Rusia.	Unfortunately, the cruelty of chance also lies at the heart of the centuries of mistrust between Poland and Russia.
后通胀时代的挑战在艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）就任美联储主席的十八年半中达到顶峰。	The challenges of the post-inflation era came to a head during Alan Greenspan’s 18-and-a-half-year tenure as Fed Chair.
中国的减速以及欧洲部分地区衰退的延长削弱了全球商品市场需求，抑制了商品出口国（如巴西、俄罗斯和南非）的增长。	China’s slowdown and prolonged recession in parts of Europe have weakened demand in global commodity markets, depressing growth in commodity-exporting countries like Brazil, Russia, and South Africa.
如果如今安倍晋三重启这一方案，将有助于打破他在试图让日本成为能够参与地区集体防务的“正常”国家的过程中所面临的地区敌对情绪。	If Abe revived this initiative today, he could help to dampen the regional antagonism he faces in trying to make Japan a “normal” country, with a military capable of participating in collective regional defense.
市政负责了德国总公共投资的一半，目前未完工投资项目价值为1,360亿欧元，或GDP的4.5 % ； 光是学校建筑就需要增加350亿欧元用于修缮。	Its municipalities, which are responsible for half of all public investment, currently have unrealized investment projects worth €136 billion, or 4.5% of GDP; Germany’s school buildings alone need another €35 billion for repairs.
拥有股票即代表你对公司盈利拥有长期索取权，公司可以将盈利用于向所有人发放股票红利，或进行再投资从而在未来给股东提供更多的红利。	Ownership of stock represents a long-term claim on a company’s earnings, which the company can pay to the owners of shares as dividends or reinvest to provide the shareholders more dividends in the future.
（克林顿也表态反对TPP，但这种反对或许仅仅是战术性的；但就特朗普而言，没有任何证据能支撑这种假设。 ）	(Clinton has also turned against the TPP, but this can be assumed to be merely tactical; in Trump’s case, no such assumption is warranted.)
在澳大利亚，每年大约每五个成年人中就有一位被确诊的心理健康问题影响，但他们中有很多人得不到专业帮助。	In Australia, roughly one in five adults is affected by a diagnosable mental-health problem each year, but many of these people receive no professional help.
人们认为这无伤大雅 — — 那是比赛的一部份，不过是沙场上的角斗士或者对立党派成员发泄激情的一种方式而已。	They were not serious – just part of the game, uttered in the heat of the gladiatorial contest on the field and the passionate partisan cheering in the stands.
但如果出现那种情况，我们必须明白我们 — — 包括欧盟及各成员国在内 — — 实际接受了自己越来越无关紧要的现实。	But, in that case, we should understand that we – both the EU and individual countries – are effectively resigning ourselves to increasing irrelevance.
贾里德·库什纳急于寻找维持现金流的大笔资金导致他寻求外国贷款，其中包括一位接近弗拉基米尔·普京的俄罗斯银行家。	Jared Kushner’s eagerness to secure the large sums needed to stay afloat has led him to seek foreign lenders, including a Russian banker close to Vladimir Putin.
这与主权或辖地无关，只是一个关于我们知识产权和技术转让方式上更偏向于中国还是西方，还是在食品和农业标准更倾向于欧盟还是美国的选择问题。	This is not about sovereignty or satrapy. It is simply a question of whether we would prefer China’s approach to intellectual property and technology transfers over those of the West, or European food and agricultural standards over those of the US.
它们应当听听这一谚语，否则，它们在伊朗核问题上将会一无所获，而剩下唯一的一个无用的选择就是军事打击了。	Otherwise, they could end up without any handle on the Iranian nuclear program, and only one – useless – option left, a military strike.
尽管澳大利亚的暴力犯罪并未因此销声匿迹，但谋杀案有所下降，更重要的是，1996年之后再未发生过死亡人数三人或以上的大规模枪击时间（3人死亡是很多研究中所定义的大规模枪击事件标准 ） 。	While violent crime has not ended in Australia, murders are down, and, even more dramatically, there has not been a single mass shooting since 1996 in which three or more people died (the definition used in many studies of mass shootings).
1795年，斯宾汉兰（位于伯克夏的一个村庄）当局批准了一项根据资产状况调查发放的按比例工资补贴方案。	In 1795, the authorities of Speenhamland, a village in Berkshire, authorized a means-tested sliding scale of wage supplements.
美国和朝鲜在技术上仍然处于战争状态，因为自1950~53年朝鲜战争虽然以停火停战告终，但至今尚未达成任何正式和平条约。	The United States and North Korea are technically still at war, because a formal peace treaty has not been concluded since the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended with a ceasefire and an armistice.
作为目前实现亚洲开发银行支出目标的唯一一个亚洲新兴经济体，中国可以利用担任G-20主席国的机会说服邻国增加该地区的投资。	China, the only major Asian emerging economy that is currently meeting the ADB’s spending target, could use its G-20 presidency to persuade its neighbors to increase investment in this area.
我所在的讨论组的主题是中国国家主席习近平所提出的中国经济的“新常态 ” ： 在三十年的两位数经济扩张期后，中国将迎来一个增长相对较缓的时期。	The topic of my panel was what President Xi Jinping has called the Chinese economy’s “new normal”: an era of relatively slower growth, following three decades of double-digit economic expansion.

正在与欧盟谈判的跨大西洋贸易和投资合作伙伴关系（Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership）则提供了另一个促进贸易的一大步。	The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership being negotiated with the European Union offers another major step toward increasing trade.
对这一弱点心知肚明的俄罗斯向叙利亚提供了更先进的S-300导弹；但没有证据表明这些导弹已经运抵叙利亚，更不用说完成部署了。	Mindful of this weakness, Russia has offered Syria its more modern S-300 missiles; but there is no evidence that they have arrived, let alone been deployed.
与此同时，银行出现了减磅外国资产的偏好，风险管理者试图用国内资产匹配国内负债，而不是将欧元区作为一个整体这个考虑问题。	Simultaneously, banks gave preference to shedding assets outside their national borders, and risk managers try to match assets and liabilities at home, rather than within the eurozone as a whole.
具体而言，希腊及其债权人必须在一套可信的减债计划上达成一致，该计划要支持重启希腊增长引擎、使其内部债务与其能力相符所需要的国内改革。	Specifically, Greece and its creditors must agree to a credible debt-reduction program that would support the domestic reforms needed to re-invigorate Greece’s growth engines and place its internal obligations in line with its capabilities.
但有一位旅行者很快认识到，写99美元是更好的选择，因为这会带来2美元额外奖励，从而让总数达到101美元。	One traveler, however, quickly realizes that writing $99 would be a better option, because it would garner that extra $2 reward, and thus a total of $101.
在很长一段时间里，以色列领导人游说像我这样的支持者（出于大屠杀的原因，我一直支持犹太人民捍卫国家和安全的权利 ） 。	For a long time, Israeli leaders have lobbied supporters like me, who, since the Holocaust, have defended the Jewish people’s right to security and statehood.
责任在于我们这些一厢情愿想要改善欧洲的效率、降低它的总体不公正性、致力于欧元区的再政治化并以此作为迈向民主化的第一步的人。	It is incumbent upon those of us who wish to improve Europe’s efficiency, and lessen its gross injustices, to work toward re-politicizing the eurozone as a first step toward democratizing it.
即便生产率能保持同样的增长速度，全球GDP增长可能放缓至年均略超2个百分点 — — 与过去50年相比下降40 % 。	Even if productivity continues to rise at the same rate, global GDP growth could slow to just over 2% annually, on average – a 40% drop from the last 50 years.
事实上，不论政权和反对派之间的实力平衡如何，叙利亚或许在数十年内（也许是永远）都无法重建强大的中央集权政府。	In fact, regardless of the balance of power between the regime and its opponents, Syria probably will not reestablish a strong, centralized government for decades, if ever.
44名Huji成员遭到逮捕，其中2名据称是由奥索玛·本·拉登（Osama Bin Laden）从南非和巴基斯坦派来将钱分发给极端主义madrassas的。	Forty-four Huji members were arrested, two of whom claimed to have been sent from South Africa and Pakistan by Osama Bin Laden to distribute money to the extremist madrassas.

希腊和葡萄牙所需贬值幅度分别为30%和35 % ， 但西班牙和意大利的数字之高已足以引起人们对欧元区未来的担忧。	While Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling 30% and 35%, respectively, the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone.
要想实现尼雷尔的让非洲成为一个强大的、有尊严的大洲的愿景，非洲需要一个自由的新时代，为非洲妇女经济赋权能够为这个时代增添动力。	To realize Nyerere’s vision of a strong, dignified continent, Africa needs a new era of liberation, one that is fueled by the economic empowerment of the continent’s women.

其次，对于这些经济政策，应辅之以明确的社会政策组合 — — 在这方面，潜在改变空间极大 — — 以满足公平负担共担的需要。	Second, he would accompany this with an explicit set of social policies – and here the potential differences are profound – that addresses the need for equitable burden-sharing.

这种理论让人想起了英国历史学家阿诺德·汤因比的说法，他认为未能正确地应对外部挑战是国家崩溃的主要原因。	This theory recalls that of the British historian Arnold Toynbee, according to which empires collapse because they are unable to react to external challenges.
在这样做的时候不应该把目标局限于国有企业，中国还有越来越多的活跃中小私人企业，范围涉及经济的所有部门。	In so doing, they should aim not only for big state-owned companies, but also for the rising number of vibrant, private small and medium-size enterprises in China that can be found in all sectors of the economy.
除了定义我们的偏好的标准的自私要素外，他们指出，人们将自己视为“社会分类”的成员。 他们从社会分类中获得身份。	Besides the standard selfish elements that define our preferences, they argue that people see themselves as members of “social categories” with which they identify.
尽管这样的体系看起来非常稳固，但从本质上讲却十分脆弱，因为对大多数人来讲，无法无天、缺乏公正和一贫如洗与上述体系如影随形。	While such systems may appear stable, they are inherently fragile, for they are synonymous with lawlessness, injustice, and abject poverty for the majority of the population.
上述对策在两次世界大战之间表现为两种致命形式：一是社会党及共产党人选择社会改革、二是法西斯份子渲染民族情绪。	The response took one of two fatal forms in the interwar period: Socialists and communists chose social reform, while fascists chose national assertion.
在梅内德斯看来，特朗普政府可以为总统和朝鲜领导人金正恩之间的峰会做准备，但不应以这种出格而隐秘的方式。	For Menendez, the audacity and secrecy of the Trump administration’s preparations for a planned summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was unacceptable.
美国不应该削减已被证明了的商业活动的谁手机里，至少一部分因降低公司税率造成的收入损失应该用提高公司股东税率的办法来补偿。	Instead of cutting proven tax incentives for business investment, the US should offset at least some of the revenue losses from a lower corporate-tax rate by raising tax rates on corporate shareholders.
在他们的著名赌局结束后，西蒙和欧利希曾考虑过进行第二次赌局，对象包括了范围甚广的一揽子指标；但这场赌局从未成行，部分是因为两人互不买账。	After their famous bet, Simon and Ehrlich considered a second bet involving a large basket of measures; but it never came about, partly because of personal antipathy between the two men.
他们身居豪宅，驾驶顶级的奔驰豪华轿车。 而在这个国家中，只有13%不到的人口拥有电力，大多数人必须靠每年200美元不到的收入过活。	Afghans are fed up with arrogant and well-armed tycoons who live in mansions and drive top-of-the range Mercedes limousines – this in a country where barely 13% of the population have electricity and most people must survive on less than $200 a year.
梅断然否认其政府与英格兰银行行长卡尼之间有任何分歧，但显然，20年来���一次，货币政策成为政治争论的主题。	While May has denied any split between her government and BoE Governor Mark Carney, it is clear that monetary policy has become a subject of political debate for the first time in 20 years.
诺贝尔经济学奖得住阿玛蒂亚·森（Amartya Sen）指出，我们可以学会带着这些多重身份生活，甚至与这些身份所带来的公民身份和忠诚的多样性共同繁荣。	Amartya Sen, the Nobel laureate economist, has argued that we can learn to live with these multiple identities and even thrive with the diversity of citizenship and loyalties that they allow us.
金融市场行为管理局的提案假设“投资者和市场有足够的能力去评估主权所有权所引发的额外风险 ” ， 但这个说法是有问题的。	The FCA proposal assumes that “investors and the market are sufficiently able to assess the additional risks arising from sovereign ownership.” But this is questionable.

如果你赢了彩票 — — 并且你所获得的巨额奖金被用来诱使其他人高估获奖机会并购买彩票从而肥了彩票商 — — 你是否“应得”你的奖金？	If you win the lottery – and if the big prize that you receive is there to induce others to overestimate their chances and purchase lottery tickets and so enrich the lottery operator – do you “deserve” your winnings?
二战结束时，根据旧金山条约第三条，钓鱼岛由美国控制，但美国于1972年将控制权交还给了日本（作为交还冲绳管辖权协议的一部分 ） 。	At WWII’s end, in accordance with Article 3 of the Treaty of San Francisco, the islands were placed under United States control, but reverted to Japan in 1972, as part of the agreement that returned to it administration of Okinawa.
但另一种可能是，当英国公民和领导人懂得从盟友的角度看待退欧时 — — 明白这是个自私的破坏性背叛 — — 已为时已晚。	But it is also possible that by the time the UK’s citizens and leaders see Brexit from their allies’ perspective – as a selfish and destructive act of betrayal – it will be too late.
虽然其领导风格各不相同，但亚洲强人们都具备一个关键特征：他们都善于利用人们对经济的无知来获取公众支持，而且尤其喜欢借助一种流行的理念，认为那些集中政治权力的领导人可以更自由地带领经济增长。	But all of Asia’s strongmen share a key characteristic: they secure public support by preying on economic ignorance. In particular, they trade on the popular belief that leaders who concentrate political power are freer to guide economic growth.
第二次巴勒斯坦大起义（Second Intifada）伴随着自杀式恐怖袭击潮，数以百计的无辜公民因此丧生，随后以色列早2000年戴维营峰会中做出了让步。	The Second Intifada, with its waves of suicide terrorist attacks that slaughtered hundreds of innocent civilians, followed the Israeli concessions offered at the 2000 Camp David Summit.
在朝鲜以及伊朗的核武器领域，国际社会有足够的理由对此不予姑息迁就，并且拒绝其要求与印度一视同仁的呼吁。	The world has good reason to be far less tolerant of what North Korea or Iran do in the realm of nuclear weapons and to reject their calls for equal treatment with India.
即便如此，美国自由主义鹰派和强硬保守派依旧认为奥巴马内阁比不上德怀特·艾森豪威尔和里根等所谓强硬派总统。	Even so, hawkish American liberals and hardline conservatives are comparing Obama’s leadership unfavorably with supposedly tougher presidents like Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.
但如果美国不急于离开，如果逊尼派国家政府愿意贡献资金和人力，如果可以说服俄罗斯扮演更具建设性的角色，那么限制暴力并改善至少部分叙利亚人的生活或许是可能的。	But limiting the violence and improving the lot of at least some Syrians might be possible if the US does not rush to leave, if Sunni governments contribute soldiers and money, and if Russia can be persuaded to play a somewhat more constructive role.
但腐败在某种程度上存在于所有国家，因此发达国家也需要保护基础设施项目不受不合适的私人影响和官员的肆意干涉。	But corruption afflicts all countries to some extent, so advanced countries also need to protect infrastructure projects from undue private influence and arbitrary official interference.
唯一的前进之道是剔除（至少暂时剔除）最不愿意接受移民的国家，在愿意共同承担责任的国家之间形成一个解决方案。	The only way forward is to leave out the countries that are most averse to accepting immigrants, at least temporarily, and create a solution involving just those that are willing to share the burden.
1945年，乔治·奥威尔（George Orwell）在回顾1936年奥运会时观察道 ， “ 竞技体育 … … 是没有硝烟的战争 。 ”	In 1945, George Orwell looked back at the 1936 Games and observed that, “serious sport … is war minus the shooting.”

类似的指控助长了民族主义、仇恨和反西方西斯底里，将俄罗斯人的注意力从普京对俄罗斯经济危机的责任上移开。	Allegations like these have whipped up nationalism, hatred, and anti-Western hysteria, distracting Russians from Putin's culpability for their country's economic crisis.
冲突和贫困仍然在许多非洲地区肆虐，但我们的大洲不��比以往任何时候都更加稳定，也拥有雄踞世界之首的经济增长率。	While conflict and poverty remain serious problems in many African regions, our continent is not only more stable than ever before; it is also experiencing some of the highest economic growth rates anywhere on the planet.

不管是在职场还是在校园，甚至是在约会应用中，我们都已经习惯于用非人工具评估我们的资格，然后分配给我们某个层级的位置。	Whether it is at work, in school, or even on dating apps, we have already become accustomed to having our eligibility assessed by impersonal tools, which then assign us positions in a hierarchy.
在前OMT时期的制度中，西班牙的资本外流 — — 不管是通过国债出售还是私人债务清算 — — 都会导致货币条件趋紧。	Under the pre-OMT regime, a capital outflow from Spain, whether through the sale of government bonds or the liquidation of private claims, resulted in tighter monetary conditions.
契约也应该透明化，并应该确保万一价格上涨 — — 一再发生的事情 — — 飞来横财不会完全流入公司的腰包。	Contracts, too, should be transparent, and should ensure that if prices soar – as they have repeatedly – the windfall gain does not go only to the company.
摆脱国际资本市场压力后，中国当局将顺从国有企业和地方官员，他们更想继续保持宽松的流动性供给，想让银行为他们的债务展期。	Freed of pressure from international capital markets, the Chinese authorities would defer to state-owned enterprises and local officials who prefer continued easy provision of liquidity and would rather see the banks simply roll over their loans.
这将让欧盟得以开启入盟谈判的第23章和24章 — — 与权利、基本自由和司法有关的内容 — — 就像 欧洲议会和欧盟委员会所宣扬的那样。	This would enable the EU to open chapters 23 and 24 of the accession talks – those that deal with rights, fundamental freedoms, and the judiciary – as the European Parliament and the European Commission advocate.
在这样牵一发而动全身的大背景下，欧盟威胁中止与西岸定居点以色列企业的业务往来似乎很成问题，此外还有针对以色列的学术和科研抵制。	In this fragile context, EU threats to halt business with Israeli companies present in the country’s West Bank settlements are problematic, as are academic and scientific boycotts against Israel.
我参与建立的日本新经济联盟（Japan Association of New Economy）认为，如果日本公司想要在国际上竞争，就必须能够招募更大的人才库。	The Japan Association of New Economy, which I helped to establish, has concluded that if Japanese companies are to compete internationally, they need to be able to recruit from a larger pool of talent.
所有以增值税为准的购买收据将会显示出支付给欧盟的金额数量，使欧盟公民意识到他们所付的数目。 这些资金将自动转账到欧盟账户并将不再算在国家预算中。	The receipts for all purchases subject to VAT would show the amount paid to the EU, making citizens aware of their contribution, which would be transferred automatically to Union accounts and would no longer be shown on national budgets.
技术创新取代了电池、假牙材料和温度计中的汞，到2000年，汞消费量下降了98 % ， 价格下跌了90 % 。	Technological innovations have replaced mercury in batteries, dental fillings, and thermometers: mercury consumption is down 98% and, by 2000, the price was down 90%.
2014年，我祖国所在的非洲和其他地区的领导人挑战了国际刑事法院的客观性和有效性。 国际刑事法院的建立曾经是结束国家领导人可以逍遥法外状况的斗争的里程碑。	In 2014, leaders in my native Africa and elsewhere challenged the objectivity and effectiveness of the International Criminal Court, the creation of which was a major milestone in the struggle to end impunity for national leaders.
事实上，麦肯锡全球研究所（MGI）的新研究发现，只要能够加快性别平等方面的进展，那么到2025年，亚太经济体GDP总量每年可以提高4.5万亿美元。	In fact, new research from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) finds that Asia-Pacific economies could boost their collective GDP by $4.5 trillion per year by 2025, just by accelerating progress toward gender equality.
时任军事管制状态下（戒严令一直持续到1983年）国家检察官的彼得罗维奇目前是法律与正义党政府夺取波兰司法控制权运动的领导者。	Stanisław Piotrowicz, the state prosecutor under martial law (which remained in effect until 1983), is currently leading the PiS government’s campaign to seize control of the Polish judiciary.
而且还不仅仅是右翼：像哥伦比亚大学马克·里拉这样的自由派知识分子正越来越有说服力地证明身份政治是糟糕选举政治的一种。	And not only the right: liberal intellectuals like Mark Lilla of Columbia University are making the increasingly persuasive case that identity politics is bad electoral politics.
人们过去将国际货币基金组织（IMF）的英文首字母缩写非正式地理解为“主要是财政（It’s Mostly Fiscal ） 。 ”	The IMF’s acronym used to stand informally for “It’s Mostly Fiscal.”
美联储几乎肯定会在12月开始加息，但货币紧缩会比以往的经济周期要慢得多，主要动机也将是金融稳定而非通胀。	The Fed will almost certainly start raising rates in December, but monetary tightening will be much slower than in previous economic cycles, and it will be motivated by concerns about financial stability, not inflation.
如果欧洲要克服当前的金融约束、获得满足其新角色要求的军事能力和协作水平，就必须更有效地集中和共享它的资源。	If Europe is to overcome its current financial constraints and acquire the military capacity and level of coordination needed to fulfill its new role, it must pool and share its resources more effectively.
媒体称之为阿根廷违约，但Twitter标签更加正确 — — “葛里萨违约 ” （ #Griesafault ） 。	The media called it a default by Argentina, but the Twitter hashtag #Griesafault was much more accurate.
但也存在匈牙利这样的特例，那里的房主愚蠢地借入了看似便宜的欧元和瑞士法郎贷款，又一次证明了这条颠扑不破的真理。	Exceptions like Hungary, where homeowners had foolishly borrowed in seemingly cheap euros and Swiss francs, proved the rule.
如果在奥运会期间有什么事或者任何事出了差错，国际的批评家可能会穷追不舍，尤其是如果它压制不满的声音并且通过有线电视和因特网将消息24小时不间断地传播到整个世界的话。	International criticism is sure to follow if something, anything, goes wrong during the Games, especially if it involves the suppression of dissent and is vectored around the world via 24-hour cable television and the Internet.
比如，挪威难民委员会（Norwegian Refugee Council）和国际救援委员会（International Rescue Committee）正在做非常重要的工作，为叙利亚提供跨国人道主义供应，帮助难民和四个难民接收国当地社区。	The Norwegian Refugee Council and the International Rescue Committee, for example, are doing important work, delivering cross-border humanitarian supplies into Syria and helping refugees and host communities in four countries.
其他各种裙带贷款也受到鼓励，一个证明是，截至3月底，不到5,000家大借款人产生了不良资产总量的90 % — —以及超过一半的印度银行贷款总量。	Other sorts of crony lending were also encouraged, reflected in the fact that fewer than 5,000 large borrowers accounted for 90% of total non-preforming assets – and more than half of all Indian bank loans – at the end of March.
这样做也许可以促使债务人和债权人共担负担，阻止“我们与他们”的对立情绪的出现 — — 后者正是恶化希腊与欧元区机构关系的罪魁。	Doing so might have facilitated the sharing of the burden between debtors and creditors and prevented the emergence of the us-versus-them attitude that poisoned the relationship between Greece and the institutions of the eurozone.
事实上，当金本位分崩离析的时候，他正在跨越大西洋的旅途当中。 英格兰银行的工作人员给他发了一封密语般的电报 ： “ 老妇人去了 。 ”	Indeed, he was literally at sea crossing the Atlantic when the gold standard broke down; the Bank of England staff advised him with a cryptic cabled message, “Old lady goes off.”
巴勒斯坦国的组织架构一旦就位，人民的意愿加上全世界的支持，必将在不使用暴力的情况下压倒一切试图剥夺巴勒斯坦民族自决权的行为。	Once the institutions of the Palestinian state are in place, the will of the people, coupled with world support, will nonviolently overcome all efforts at denying Palestinians their right to self-determination.
他随后拒绝接受国际《海洋法公约 》 ； 反对世界银行推进节能减排；命令美国撤出联合国教科文组织；还跟特朗普一样发誓要减少美国对国际组织的贡献。	He subsequently rejected the international Law of the Sea Treaty; opposed the World Bank’s promotion of energy conservation; withdrew the US from UNESCO; and, like Trump, pledged to reduce America’s contributions to international organizations.
但是如果美国过早撤离，当选的伊拉克政府又可能无力应付叛乱局面，从而使伊拉克陷入上世纪80年代黎巴嫩、或者90年代阿富汗的状态。	But, if America leaves too soon, the elected Iraqi government may be unable to cope with the insurgency, sending Iraq the way of Lebanon in the 1980’s or Afghanistan in the 1990’s.
）历史经验没有告诉我们，数量上大得多的移民会带来怎样的社会和政治后果，也没有告诉我们，战后来到欧洲的移民（特别是穆斯林移民）的更加显著的文化差异会带来怎样的社会和政治后果。	Historical experience offers little guide to the social and political consequences of the much greater numbers and more pronounced cultural differences at stake in the postwar migrations to Europe, especially from the Muslim world.
也许如此，但如果你仅仅因为一项实验性癌症治疗方法在小白鼠身上出现了令人欣喜的效果就开始抽烟，那你一定是疯了。	Maybe so, but it would be barking mad to take up smoking simply because an experimental cancer treatment showed some promise on a lab rat.
尽管如此，报告认为，目前美国对外出口仍然面临数千项保护主义阻挠措施，这给了特朗普提高美国贸易壁垒的借口。	Nonetheless, the report argues, the thousands of protectionist measures that still impede US exports in other countries may well give Trump the excuse he needs to increase barriers of his own.
如今，昂山素季无法竞选总统，因为一条犬儒主义宪法条文禁止任何配偶或子女拥有外国护照的人竞选总统（昂山素季与已故英国丈夫的两个儿子持有英国护照 ） 。	For now, Suu Kyi is precluded from running for President by a cynical constitutional provision that excludes anyone whose spouse or child has a foreign passport (Suu Kyi’s two sons by her late English husband hold British passports).
但是，同样根本性的分化却发生在伊拉克的富人和穷人之间。 这一分化造成的暴乱如同因种族矛盾以及反抗美军率领的军事占领所造成的一样巨大。	But an equally fundamental division – one that has contributed as much to the ongoing insurrection as sectarian strife and opposition to the American-led military occupation – is the widening gap between Iraq’s rich and poor.
所以，如果有几个中期因素在抑制全球经济恢复持续增长的能力，经济稳定的嫩芽就可能会被滞胀的枯草所代替。	So, green shoots of stabilization may be replaced by yellow weeds of stagnation if several medium-term factors constrain the global economy’s ability to return to sustained growth.
多哈 — — 当海湾阿拉伯国家6月5日宣布因卡塔尔与恐怖分子有染而切断与其的外交关系时，所传递出的信息明确无误：要么遵守区域政策，要么付出代价。	DOHA – When Gulf Arab powers announced on June 5 that they were severing diplomatic ties with Qatar over its ties to terrorists, the message was clear: get in line with regional policies, or pay the price.
但伦齐更大的问题在于他是一个在上一任总理任期中间切入的非选举上台总理，而且在2014年承诺为这个国家带来变革 — — 这个词汇早就让意大利人听得耳朵起茧子了。	But Renzi’s bigger problem is that he is a mid-term, unelected prime minister who promised, in 2014, to bring change to a country that has heard it all before.
本纳拉殴打示威者的一段11秒视频节选在新闻频道反复播放，有关总统夫妇私生活的怪诞猜测几乎同时在新闻频道播出。	An 11-second clip from the original video of Benalla beating a demonstrator played in a loop on the news channels, running nearly simultaneously with grotesque speculations about the private life of the presidential couple.

另外一间企业则叫做Xtify，是老牌企业家安德鲁·韦里奇创立的一间公司，主要业务是帮助企业向顾客提供当日报价，而这种顾客则是在附近活动并可以用手机联系得到的那一群人。	Next is Xtify, founded by long-time entrepreneur Andrew Weinreich, which is focused on time-of-day pricing targeted at people who are nearby and reachable on their mobile phones.
要那些居住在贫困国家、无法获得清洁能源和技术的16亿人民去承担技术改革所需的费用是不现实的，尽管这样的技术改革非常必需。	It is unrealistic to ask poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies, to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change.
首先，尽管战略武器控制协议和单方面裁军已经搞了几十年，国际社会却依然未能拿出一个标准化手段来保证一个自称解除武装的国家实际上履行了承诺。	First, despite decades of strategic arms-control agreements and unilateral disarmament, the international community has no standardized way to guarantee that a country claiming to disarm is actually doing so.
纽约 — — 在巴黎联合国气候变化大会（COP21）召开之前，150多个国家政府提交了截止2030年的碳减排方案。	NEW YORK – In the run-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, more than 150 governments submitted plans to reduce carbon emissions by 2030.

在许多人看来，当今个人主义的发展是对团结的最大威胁，但这种观点其实是拘泥于一种逐渐走向没落的共同身份定义。	Many view the development of an individualistic outlook as the greatest threat to solidarity nowadays. But this is closely linked to a diminishing sense of common identity.
根据世界货币基金组织的统计，运用消费者价格指数所衡量的世界通货膨胀自2005年以来在总体上呈下降的趋势，只不过在2007年有小幅的上涨。	According to the IMF, world inflation, as measured by consumer price indices, has generally been declining since 2005, and has picked up only slightly in 2007.
但最近《金融时报 》 / 哈里斯民意调查在美国、德国、法国、英国、意大利和西班牙的结果却显示，认为全球化利大于弊的人数上升了近三倍。	But a recent Financial Times/Harris poll in the US, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain found people nearly three times more likely to say that globalization is negative than positive.
虽然跨太平洋伙伴关系尚未集齐其所有11个签署国的批准，但如果这些国家可以齐心协力推动协议达成，说不定韩国和印尼等其他亚洲国家也会有意加入。	The TPP has not yet been ratified by all of its 11 remaining signatories. But if these countries can come together and push the agreement through, one can imagine that other Asian powers such as South Korea and Indonesia will be tempted to join.
此外，专注于提高回报率的巨额金融投资很有可能会推动技术创新，并由此进一步加大对金融和其他监管体系所造成的压力。	Meanwhile, enormous financial investments focused on securing a higher rate of return are likely to fuel technological innovation, further stressing regulatory systems in finance and beyond.
消费者不仅面临更高的汽车成本；现有有效供应链的中断甚至可能导致美国汽车业生存环境整体恶化，因为它破坏了北美产品的国际竞争力。	Not only will consumers face higher costs for autos; the disruption of existing efficient supply chains may even leave the US auto industry as a whole worse off, as it undermines the international competitiveness of North American output.
但是，银行利润和奖金早已恢复了原状，贷款却没有复苏，即使是创纪录的长期和短期利率也没能让贷款活跃起来。	But, while bank profitability and bonuses have returned, lending has not recovered, despite record-low long- and short-term interest rates.

他还拒绝签署最近的七国集团公报，声称美国就像一个“每个人都在（利用不公平交易手段）抢劫”的“小猪储蓄罐 ” 。	Similarly, his refusal to sign the recent G7 communiqué was couched in the claim that the US is like a “piggy bank that everybody is robbing” through unfair trading practices.
而笔者于1985的关于通货膨胀和中央银行的独立性的研究表明，在正常情况下，人们需要一个比普通的知情公民更重视与失业相关的价格稳定的中央银行家。	My own research in 1985 on inflation and central-bank independence showed that, in normal times, one generally wants a central banker who places greater emphasis on price stability relative to unemployment than an ordinary informed citizen might do.

这一一体化能源市场将带来巨大的节约 — — 到2030年估计可达每年400亿欧元 — — 从而带来急需的竞争力提振。	Such an integrated energy market would lead to significant savings – estimates go as high as €40 billion ($51 billion) annually by 2030 – thereby providing a much-needed competitiveness boost.
新技术甚至可以让迷你电网提供商为比常规的基于公用事业的方法效率更高、恢复力更强的电力系统开发全新的组织模式。	New technologies could even enable mini-grid providers to develop entirely new organizational models for electricity systems that are more effective and resilient than the conventional utility-based approach.
伯克利—美国和其他发达经济体私人投资疲软，2008年全球金融危机后的复苏的这一特征令人担忧，也令人困惑。	BERKELEY – The weakness of private investment in the United States and other advanced economies is a worrisome – and perplexing – feature of the recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis.
不管未来几年医生使用什么预测方法，也许都能使他们能够告知存在温和认知损伤的患者短期内罹患阿尔茨海默症的概率。	Whichever predictive methods doctors use over the next few years will probably enable them to inform those patients with mild cognitive impairment about their chances of developing Alzheimer’s in the short term.
毕竟，尽管国会毫无必要地让经济增长处于潜在水平之下（如果国会不谨慎行事，极有可能进一步下降 ） ， 但仍然再一次胜过了欧洲。	After all, economic growth, while unnecessarily held below potential by Congress (and vulnerable to decline if Congress is not careful), has again outpaced that of Europe.
这一自我加强的金融反馈对于传播全球经济传染病的效力远远大于常规商业或贸易风险暴露，2008—2009年的经验已经说明了这一点。	Such self-reinforcing financial feedback is much more powerful in transmitting global economic contagion than ordinary commercial or trade exposures, as the world learned in 2008-2009.
其次，在利库德集团的本杰明·内塔尼亚胡担任总理的情况下，以色列的现政府愿意 — — 或者能够 — — 做出重大让步，从西岸撤出数十万以色列定居者的可能性大大降低。	Second, with Likud’s Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister, Israel now has a government which is far less likely to be willing – or able – to make major concessions and evacuate hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers from the West Bank.
布什总统最初把萨达姆发展大规模杀伤性武器计划、该政权被指称与基地组织的联系以及伊拉克违反人权和缺乏民主作为入侵伊拉克的理由。	President Bush initially justified intervention in Iraq on the grounds of Saddam’s programs to develop weapons of mass destruction, the regime’s alleged links to al-Qaida, as well as Iraq’s violation of human rights and lack of democracy.
有观察家声称欧洲现在分裂为自由民主的西方和极不自由的选民授权民粹主义分子的东方其实犯了用文化来解释政治结果的同样的错误。	Observers who claim that Europe is now split between a liberal-democratic West and an East where deeply illiberal electorates have brought populists to power make the same mistake of explaining all political outcomes in terms of culture.
如果东南亚联盟无法从中斡旋，泰柬两国将会求助于联合国安理会，而正是联合国早前在泰柬两国的努力游说下将这一事务委派给东南亚联盟。	If ASEAN is not allowed a mediating role, the Thai-Cambodian spat may wind its way back to the United Nations Security Council, which earlier delegated the issue to ASEAN amidst heavy lobbying by Cambodia and Thailand.
因此，我与来自包括哈佛、耶鲁、伯克利的美国顶尖法律专家联名致信总统奥巴马，解释这些条款对我们的司法制度造成了怎样的伤害。	That is why I joined leading US legal experts, including from Harvard, Yale, and Berkeley, in writing a letter to congressional leaders explaining how damaging to our system of justice these agreements are.

尽管无法得知她是否还建议除掉张成泽，但健康状况日益恶化的她认为不能让金氏王朝落入其夫之手并不令人奇怪。	Though it cannot be known whether she also proposed killing him, it is not surprising that she believed that, with her own health failing, she could not leave the family dynasty to her husband’s care.
