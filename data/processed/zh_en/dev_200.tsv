到20世纪80年代，阿萨姆邦学生仍因为对失去土地和工作机会的前景感到怒不可遏而举行大规模抗议活动，抗议活动偶尔会导致暴力冲突的爆发。	By the 1980s, Assamese students – angry at the prospect of losing land and job opportunities – were staging mass protests, which occasionally erupted into violence.
这些运动并不是2001年9月11日以后在美国或者欧洲产生的，而且他们不会等候、依赖美国或者欧盟来采取行动。	These movements were not created in the US or Europe after September 11, 2001, and they will not wait for or depend on the US or the EU to act.
但欧洲的构建逻辑要求法国来补充德国 — — 现在还需要其他主要欧盟国家的补充，包括意大利、西班牙、英国和波兰。	But the logic of how Europe was constructed requires that France complement Germany – and now that other major EU countries, including Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Poland, do so as well.
更深层次的经济衰退 — — 就像委员会计划所预期的那样 — — 将进一步减少岛内机会，从而促使更多移民流向大陆。	A deeper recession – as anticipated by the Board’s plan – will further decrease opportunities in the island, fueling more migration to the mainland.
比如，在美国，最顶端的1%人口占收入的比例比20世纪70年代末翻了一番多，从年GDP的8%上升为目前的20%以上，上一次达到如此程度还是在20世纪20年代。	In the United States, for example, the income share of the top 1% of the population has more than doubled since the late 1970’s, from about 8% of annual GDP to more than 20% recently, a level not reached since the 1920’s.
而其中一个最明显的系统性欺骗行为，就是许多中国官员都利用假冒或者循不正常途径取得的学历文凭来粉饰自己的简历。	One of the most obvious signs of systemic cheating is that many Chinese officials use fake or dubiously acquired academic credentials to burnish their resumes.
但如果它最终提醒我们自由贸易给人们带来的风险，以及我们是否改善了我们的保险机制来帮助他们，那么它可能会得到有一个圆满的结局。	But it could have a happy ending if it eventually reminds us of the risks that free trade imposes on people, and if we improve our insurance mechanisms to help them.
《华盛顿邮报》为读者提供了对一个名叫奥马尔·卡德尔（Omar Khadr）的未成年的加拿大人的刑讯审问录像报道，奥马尔·卡德尔展示了他仍然流着血的腹部伤口，哭泣着向抓捕他的人求饶。	The Washington Post gave readers actual video footage of the abusive interrogation of a Canadian minor, Omar Khadr, who was seen showing his still-bleeding abdominal wounds, weeping and pleading with his captors.
然而即便是将企业税率从35％降至30％都很困难，共和党人将不得不通过迫使那些目前缴税较少的行业（如药品和科技行业）更多缴税来扩大税基。	Even cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 30% would be difficult. Republicans would have to broaden the tax base by forcing entire sectors – such as pharmaceuticals and technology – that currently pay little in taxes to start paying more.
的确，在谢瓦尔德纳泽统治时期，稳定并不总是与民主相关。 谢瓦尔德纳泽是前苏联外长，在玫瑰革命中被赶下总统宝座。	To be sure, stability was not always identified with democracy during the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Union foreign minister who was ousted as our president by the Rose Revolution.
无论是科学出版物、研究人员或接受高质量高等教育人群的总体数量，欧洲与国际合作伙伴（同时也是竞争对手）相比都毫不逊色。	In terms of numbers – whether of scientific publications, researchers, or overall access to high-quality tertiary education – Europe compares favorably with its international partners (which are also competitors).
随着抑郁状态的加重，病人除了感到极度的悲伤和无助，还会伴有丧失自信、内疚、失忆和精力难以集中等症状，导致他们陷入极度的痛苦之中。	As depression worsens, feelings of extreme sadness and hopelessness combine with low self-esteem, guilt, memory loss, and concentration difficulties to bring about a severely painful state of mind.
法国总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德已经要求美国总统奥巴马介入此事以减少罚款额，欧盟内部市场及服务专员米歇尔·巴尼埃（Michel Barnier）也提出了同样的请求。	French President François Hollande asked US President Barack Obama to intervene to have the fine reduced, as did the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market and services, Michel Barnier.
比如，在巴西，公民社会代表占据了国家粮食和营养安全委员会（National Council on Food and Nutrition Security）的三分之二席位，因此有机会影响最高层的决策。	In Brazil, for example, civil-society representatives comprise two-thirds of the National Council on Food and Nutrition Security, and thus have the opportunity to influence policymaking at the highest level.
中国官方愿意公布的上一个关于年度劳工抗议活动的数字是1999年的100000起。 而据公安部2001年的一份内部报告披露，该数字自1997年以来“如疾风般增长 ” 。	The last annualized figure for labor protests that Beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999.
但是，在中国经济和地缘政治崛起的同时，美国似乎在竭尽全力浪费其所拥有的经济、科技和地缘政治优势，这着实令人惊讶。	Still, it is striking that just as China is rising economically and geopolitically, the US seems to be doing everything possible to waste its own economic, technological, and geopolitical advantages.
如果谷物生产国和消费国精诚合作，阻止此类政府干预 — — 可以通过世界贸易组织来实现 — — 世界价格的波动性是可以降低的。	If producing and consuming countries in grain markets could cooperatively agree to refrain from such government intervention – probably by working through the World Trade Organization – world price volatility might be lower.
“我们已经从过去15年的错误中，特别是从在某种程度上忽略了人民运动的错误中，吸取了教训 。 ” 他在四月份于非洲国民大会党横扫对手取得胜利之前，如是说。	“We have learned from the mistakes of the past 15 years, especially the manner of which we may have, to some degree, neglected the people’s movement,” he said in April, before his African National Congress swept to victory.
事实上，考虑到贸易协定的复杂性 — — 包括对难以量化的非关税壁垒的强调 — — 这些估算可能非常不准确。	In fact, given the complexity of the trade agreement – including the emphasis on hard-to-quantify non-tariff barriers – these estimates are likely to be highly imprecise.
如今，采取非军事强制手段已经无法再取得很好的效果，尽管安理会威胁要将暴行 — — 包括任何使用化学武器的行为 — — 送上国际刑事法庭不能取消。	It is too late now for non-military tools of coercion to have much effect, although Security Council threats of International Criminal Court prosecution for atrocity crimes – including any use of chemical weapons – must remain on the table .
如今，标普500指数可以产生7%的年收益，因此理应无人问津美国政府的30年经通胀调整的债券 — — 收益率只有每年1 % 。	In a world in which the S&P 500 has a 7% annual earnings yield, nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1% per year.
在最近关于电子窃听的汹涌民意中，谁可以获得个体的个人数据必须由个体自己决定这一概念显得特别有号召力。	Amid the current furor over electronic eavesdropping, the notion that individuals should decide who can access their personal data is particularly appealing.
消费者不仅面临更高的汽车成本；现有有效供应链的中断甚至可能导致美国汽车业生存环境整体恶化，因为它破坏了北美产品的国际竞争力。	Not only will consumers face higher costs for autos; the disruption of existing efficient supply chains may even leave the US auto industry as a whole worse off, as it undermines the international competitiveness of North American output.
土耳其好像收到了欧盟委员会的最后通牒，那就是在一个月内向来自塞浦路斯的船只开放港口，否则，就有暂停目前正在进行的入盟谈判的危险。	Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission: open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month, or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway.
但另一种可能是，当英国公民和领导人懂得从盟友的角度看待退欧时 — — 明白这是个自私的破坏性背叛 — — 已为时已晚。	But it is also possible that by the time the UK’s citizens and leaders see Brexit from their allies’ perspective – as a selfish and destructive act of betrayal – it will be too late.
以低廉的价格购买一半的比雷埃夫斯港与其说是从长远角度投资希腊的经济和金融，还不如说是趁火打劫占取便宜。 但实际情况是否真的如此？	To buy half of the Piraeus harbor at a knockdown price may seem more advantageous than investing in the long-term consolidation of the Greek economy and its finances, but is that really the case?
因为现在的金融危机已经使许多西方资产变得很便宜，它们现在处在俄罗斯政府和主要俄罗斯公司伸手可及的范围之内。	As today’s financial crisis has made many Western assets cheap, they are now within reach of Russia’s government and leading Russian companies.
有些央行官员喜欢回忆温斯顿·丘吉尔为决战英国的英雄主义者所唱的赞歌 ： “ 如此多的人欠少数人巨额债务的状况在人类历史上是绝无仅有的 。 ”	Some central bankers like to recall Winston Churchill’s paean to the heroism of those who fought the decisive Battle of Britain: “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.”
辅助和教唆小布什的是美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan ） ， 他怪异地认为盈余是一个威胁。	He was aided and abetted by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who bizarrely considered the surpluses a threat.
英国拥有丰富的外交经验，强大的国际影响力以及军事和经济资源，可用来支持联合行动，同样地，欧盟的支持能够大大提升英国政策在世界舞台的影响。	The UK has significant diplomatic experience, international influence, and military and economic resources that can be brought to bear on joint ventures, just as the EU’s backing can provide a major boost to UK policies on the world stage.
纳税人和政府不得不出手援助债权人，即使援助会鼓励过度冒险的行为也在所不惜，因为他们害怕倒闭产生毁灭性效应会蔓延开来。	Taxpayers and governments alike are tired of bailing out creditors for fear of the destructive contagious effects of failure – even as bailouts encourage excessive risk taking.
脱欧倡导者提出，一旦摆脱有缺陷的共同农业政策束缚，英国就可以建立一个更具竞争力的农业部门，更好地服务于农民和农业工作者的利益，包括减少依赖扭曲资源配置的补贴。	Once freed from the flawed CAP, Brexit’s proponents argue, the UK will be able to build a more competitive agricultural sector that better serves farmers and agricultural workers, including by reducing dependence on distorting subsidies.
的确，在与中国电视人共事的过程中，我发现了一种微妙的，近乎本能的避免任何特别、新颖、非正统，更别说是颠覆性的内容的倾向。	Indeed, working daily with Chinese TV creators, I noticed a subtle, almost instinctive tendency to avoid any content or format that is unusual, novel, or unorthodox, never mind subversive.
现在，显然克里米亚不会再回到基辅手中；但同样显然的是5月选举的延期将意味着乌克兰的末日，我们都知道这一点。	It is now clear that Crimea will not return to Kyiv; but it is also clear that postponement of the May election will mean the end of Ukraine, as we know it.
立宪大会主席内姆邦（Subash Chandra Nembang）试图以自己的方式解决这一问题，他制作了有争议的宪法草案的调查表。 如果宪法草案采用，将在事实上引入多数程序。	Constituent Assembly Chairman Subash Chandra Nembang has attempted to resolve the problem his own way, preparing questionnaires on disputed constitutional issues that, if used, would effectively institute a majority process.
这个国家方兴未艾的经济和政治发展让生活在这里的人，以及像我这样的关注它的观察者，对它的未来感到喜忧参半。	The country’s ongoing process of economic and political development has left those living here, as well as concerned observers like me, both hopeful and worried about the future.
此外，明年的经济增长仍将微弱（较之2%或者更高的普遍观点 ） 、 而失业率仍将高企（约为10 % ） ，以致于让我们感到仍然处在衰退之中。	Moreover, growth next year will be so weak (0.5 to 1%, as opposed to the consensus of 2% or more) and unemployment so high (above 10%) that it will still feel like a recession.
美国参谋长联席会议主席邓普希（Martin Dempsey）承认，对于叙利亚局势，美国缺少明确的路线图。	Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, has admitted that the United States lacks a clear picture of the situation in Syria.
针对国际足联的不当行为指控从国际足联执行委员会委员的假球和贿赂到卡塔尔为何被选为2022年世界杯的主办国。	Allegations of wrongdoing range from match-fixing and bribery among members of FIFA’s Executive Committee to questions about how Qatar was chosen to host the World Cup in 2022.
上个月，奥斯本的继任者菲利普·哈蒙德（Phillip Hammond）表示他将签署390亿英镑资金支持北方强区铁路项目。	Crucially, what came to be called the northern powerhouse model was designed in such a way as to complement London, rather than undercut it through competition.
现今繁荣的这些经济活动长期以来是被归入服务业，而非制造业的，但是服务业并不意味着脱离实际，与世隔绝。	Previously, the economic activities that are now flourishing weren’t categorized as manufacturing industries at all, but as “services.” But services do not exist in a vacuum.
但如果美国不急于离开，如果逊尼派国家政府愿意贡献资金和人力，如果可以说服俄罗斯扮演更具建设性的角色，那么限制暴力并改善至少部分叙利亚人的生活或许是可能的。	But limiting the violence and improving the lot of at least some Syrians might be possible if the US does not rush to leave, if Sunni governments contribute soldiers and money, and if Russia can be persuaded to play a somewhat more constructive role.
毕竟，在痛苦的去杠杆过程中（即减少开支、增加储蓄以降低债务 ） ， 国内私人和公共需求将受到抑制，重塑增长的唯一希望是贸易平衡的改善，而这要求欧元大幅贬值。	After all, with painful deleveraging – spending less and saving more to reduce debts – depressing domestic private and public demand, the only hope of restoring growth is an improvement in the trade balance, which requires a much weaker euro.
当南非一流的黑人免疫学家马克沟巴(Malegapuru Makgoba)教授警告��贝基总统的政策会使南非成为世界科学界的笑柄时，姆贝基办公室指责他是在为种族主义的西方观点辩护。	When Professor Malegapuru Makgoba, South Africa’s leading black immunologist, warned that the president’s policies would make South Africa a laughingstock in the world of science, Mbeki’s office accused him of defending racist Western ideas.
受日益恶化的通胀和失业权衡的警示，凯恩斯主义决策者试图通过收入政策维持繁荣 — — 通过国家与工会的协议控制工资成本。	Alert to a worsening tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, Keynesian policymakers tried to sustain the boom through incomes policy – controlling wage costs by concluding national agreements with trade unions.
事实上，特朗普政府发表的官方国家安全战略描绘了美国为维护全球秩序而作出的努力是如何产生反作用和自我挫败的。	Indeed, the Trump administration’s official National Security Strategy portrays US efforts to safeguard the global order as counterproductive and self-defeating.
最近的政治漫画画着英国轰炸机起飞执行任务，一名飞行员对旁边的人说 ， “ 轰炸伦敦南部的几个年轻人似乎有很长的路要走 。 ”	A recent political cartoon showed British bombers taking off on a mission, with one pilot saying to the others, “It seems a long way to go to bomb a few young men from South London.”
组织必须采取更多的行动来增加自己在网络，学校和大学的曝光率，因为学生往往是最容易接受全球公民这一概念的人。	The Fund must also do more to enhance its presence on the Web and in school and university classrooms, especially as students are often the most receptive to ideas about global citizenship.
政府官员想必已经意识到英国达不到2%的目标所能带来的尴尬，因此他们在四处寻找能塞进国防部预算、以抬高开支的计划。	Government officials presumably recognize the embarrassment that would be caused were Britain to fall short of the 2% target, so they seem to be looking for programs that can be squeezed into the Defense Department’s budget to pad spending.
在最近的危机之前，经济学家一直在大谈“大稳健 ” （ great moderation ） ： 经济波动将趋缓，许多人认为经济稳定政策效果达到了新的高度。	Until the recent crisis, economists were talking up the “great moderation”: economic fluctuations were supposedly becoming milder, and many concluded that economic stabilization policy had reached new heights of effectiveness.
剩下的两个职位，也就是欧洲议会主席以及容克尔目前担任的“欧洲先生”职务也将会促进总体平衡并且反映2009年年中欧洲议会选举的结果。	The remaining two posts, president of the European Parliament and the “Mr. Euro” job currently held by Juncker, will also have to contribute to overall balance and reflect the outcome of the European Parliament elections in mid-2009.
其结果是，劳动力总和收入 — — 工作岗位数乘以工作小时数乘以每小时平均工资 — — 下降的幅度很大。	As a result, total labor income – the product of jobs times hours worked times average hourly wages – has fallen dramatically.
德国总理默克尔给出了正确的答案。 上个月，在与特朗普和其他G7领导人会晤之后，默克尔说欧洲不能继续“完全仰仗他人 ” ， 而必须“靠自己为自己的未来奋斗 。 ”	Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel gave the right answer when, after meeting with Trump and other G7 leaders last month, she said that Europe could no longer “fully count on others,” and would have to “fight for our own future ourselves.”
关键的考验在于他改革劳动力市场的能力，而劳动力市场僵化被广泛认为是法国经济表现相对落后的主要原因。 在过去25年时间里，法国的失业率从来就没有低于8 % 。	The crucial test will be his ability to reform the labor market, whose rigidities are widely seen as the main cause of France’s relatively poor economic performance, with an unemployment rate that has never dipped below 8% over the last 25 years.
任何破坏国际贸易这一战后全球经济增长主要引擎的做法将不可避免地提高每个人的生活成本 — — 包括那些作为特朗普政治基础的劳动阶层。	Any effort to undermine international trade – a leading engine of global economic growth since the end of WWII – will inevitably impose high costs on everyone, including the working-class members of Trump’s political base.
他不仅支持李森科的理论，还相信出于顽固的意识形态而坚持共产主义统治能够克服自然定律的工程师和地质学家。	He not only supported the Lysenko theories, but also believed ideologically hardened engineers and geologists who insisted that the rules of communism could defy the laws of nature.
如果以后这个妇女想要一个孩子，为什么她使用她的较早的堕胎掉的胎儿的DNA，而不去通过通常的方式怀上另一个胎儿呢？	If, at a later date, the woman wants to have a child, why should she use the DNA of her earlier, aborted fetus rather than conceiving another fetus in the usual way?
事实上，他已经表示要对欧洲汽车实施进口关税 — — 特别是宝马和奔驰 — — 以帮助美国汽车制造商，尽管这会伤害美国消费者。	Indeed, he has already pledged to impose tariffs on European cars – targeting, in particular, BMW and Mercedes – to help US car producers, even though this will also hurt American consumers.
第三，近几个季度，英国经济增长相当缓慢，大刀阔斧的财政瘦身政策生不逢时，上扬的通胀令英格兰银行不敢出台宽松的货币政策来加以配合。	Third, economic growth has been flat on average in the UK over the last couple of quarters, with front-loaded fiscal austerity coming at a time when rising inflation is preventing the Bank of England from easing monetary policy.
他还力图与邻国委内瑞拉激化矛盾，希望借此来浑水摸鱼。 他寄希望于自己选定的继承人前国防部长胡安·曼努埃尔·桑托斯联合国内的右翼势力，以确保他的政策能够继续实施。	He has also sought to benefit from ratcheting up tensions with neighboring Venezuela, and counts on his dauphin, former Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, to unite the country’s right-wing forces in order to ensure continuity with his policies.
中国政府一向对外交礼节斤斤计较，因此，人们难以想象，中国政府并无刻意安排，从而显示出美国相对于持有一万四千亿美元国债的国家衰落这一鲜明形象。	It is hard to imagine that China’s government, which obsesses over every minute issue of diplomatic protocol, had not orchestrated this stark image of America’s decline relative to the country to which it owes $1.4 trillion.
上个月，纳勒斯在社会民主党内部发起了一场辩论，她宣称德国“不能接收所有人 ” ， 这似乎是对右翼言论的一种呼应。	Last month, Nahles launched the debate within the SPD when, seemingly echoing right-wing rhetoric, she declared that Germany “cannot accept all.”
事实上，尽管关于欧元区生存的担忧总是集中在债务国，但欧洲货币联盟的风险是失去仅有的几个仍保有3A新用评级的成员国之一：芬兰。	In fact, while concerns over the eurozone’s survival tend to focus on its indebted members, Europe’s monetary union is at risk of losing one of the few members that still enjoys a triple-A credit rating: Finland.
这个法庭—以几乎不可能的方式集结了柬埔寨本国和外国的法官、律师及适用法律—旨在这个国家长久以来法律惩戒形同虚设的国家成为司法改革和司法独立的样板。	The court – with its improbable blend of Cambodian and foreign judges and attorneys as well as laws – is meant to be a model for judicial reform and independent justice in a country where impunity has long been the rule.
这一一体化能源市场将带来巨大的节约 — — 到2030年估计可达每年400亿欧元 — — 从而带来急需的竞争力提振。	Such an integrated energy market would lead to significant savings – estimates go as high as €40 billion ($51 billion) annually by 2030 – thereby providing a much-needed competitiveness boost.
1832年《改革法案 》 （ Reform Act）授予财产不少于10英镑的个人投票权 — — 平心而论标准不低，但已足以让中产阶级获得选举权。	The 1832 Reform Act gave the vote to individuals with at least £10 of property – not an inconsequential sum, to be sure, but low enough to enfranchise the middle class.
正如奥巴马所说 ， “ 如果伊朗抓住这一机会，伊朗人民就能从重新回到国际社会获益良多，而我们也可以开始消弭存在于我们两国之间的不信任。	As Obama put it, “If Iran seizes this opportunity, the Iranian people will benefit from rejoining the international community, and we can begin to chip away at the mistrust between our two nations.
而虽然很有必要去知道是谁得到了习主席的重用，但我并不觉得这一事件的场景和阴谋论跟它所呈现的那般有趣。	But while it is important to know who Xi’s favorites are, I do not find the theater and intrigue of the event to be as interesting as it is made out to be.
但事实上核事务只是双方���以对峙合理化的工具，伊朗领导人用它来向国内听众煽动核爱国主义情绪，而美国人则借此向国外听众宣扬核浓缩威胁论。	Indeed, the nuclear issue has served to rationalize the face-off, with Iran’s leaders playing to their domestic audience by whipping up nuclear nationalism and the US playing to the international audience by harping on the proliferation threat.
这种行事方式从一开始就是东盟经济战略不可或缺的一部分，并将继续延续下去，与即将建立的区域综合经济伙伴关系框架下将东盟与中国、日本、韩国、印度、澳大利亚和新西兰连结起来。	This approach has been integral to ASEAN’s economic strategy from the beginning, and continues with the soon-to-be concluded Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership joining ASEAN with China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand.
2005年，阿根廷政府终于拨冗参与债务互换谈判时，它几乎可以任意指定条件 — — 70%的“剃头 ” （ haircut ） 。	When, in 2005, the government finally got around to negotiating a debt swap, it could almost dictate the terms – a 70% “haircut.”
但维也纳协议理应获得广泛支持，因为其他办法 — — 最好情况是继续尖锐地区对立，最坏情况是军事冲突 — — 更加糟糕。	But the Vienna agreement deserves wide support, and not just because the alternatives – continuation of acute regional tension at best, and catastrophic military conflict at worst – are so unappealing.
有些国家希望订立一个安全保证条约，确保无核国家不会受到核武器威胁；而另一些国家则试图订立条约防止在外太空出现军备竞赛。	Some want a treaty on security guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon states to assure them against the threat or use of nuclear weapons; others want a treaty to prevent an arms race in outer space.
不严格遵守治疗方法、临床医生不正确用药和药物相互作用或吸收障碍都可能导致细菌生长被部分抑制，产生具有耐药性的有机生物。	Poor adherence to the therapeutic regimen, improper prescribing by clinicians, and drug interactions or malabsorption can result in partial suppression of bacterial growth and the emergence of resistant organisms.
1914年7月，各国外交官试图找出一个解决方案，让哈布斯堡王朝加入跨国政策谈判 — — 恐怖袭击的必然结果。	In July 1914, diplomats were trying to devise a solution that would permit the Habsburg Empire to deal with the cross-border police investigation that was inevitable after a terrorist attack.
倘若我们不在真正权力归属的问题上自欺欺人，那么就让总统们和议会们多如牛毛吧，如果那样能让人们觉得舒服的话。	Provided we do not deceive ourselves about where real power lies, let presidents and parliaments be three a penny if that is what makes people feel good about themselves.
在20年前的中东欧地区，一场全面的变革要求人们抛弃，更换或者重新建立所有的政治和经济体制；这意味着把全部整个社会的“硬件”换一遍。	In Central and Eastern Europe 20 years ago, comprehensive change demanded that all political and economic institutions be discarded, altered, or built anew; a complete change in society’s “hardware” was required.
崇尚鲜活社会主权的国家主义含蓄而又彻底地削弱了上帝的地位；即便与宗教融合并以宗教用语的形式出现，也无法改变其根本的世俗性质。	By considering a living community sovereign, nationalism implicitly but drastically reduced the relevance of God; even when combined with religion and presented in a religious idiom, it was essentially secular.
他还宣称，该决定“绝不是为了表明我们抛弃了推动长期和平协议的承诺 ， ” 这是一个“对以色列和巴勒斯坦都非常好的方案 。 ”	He also claimed that the decision “is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement,” one “that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.”
如果被大数据损害的民众没有追索途径，那么就像数据学家凯蒂·奥尼尔在其最新著作数学武器毁灭中所展示的那样，将有可能带来影响深远的有害结果。	When people who are harmed by Big Data have no avenues for recourse, the results can be toxic and far-reaching, as data scientist Cathy O’Neil demonstrates in her recent book Weapons of Math Destruction.
这个数字背后的残酷现实是：很多年轻母亲们正死于缺少多数人在二十一世纪已经习以为常的服务 — — 那就是负担得起的医疗保健服务。	The harsh reality behind these figures is this: mothers, very often young, are dying for lack of what most of us take for granted in the twenty-first century – access to affordable health care.
其次，我的同事苏菲（Amir Sufi）与合作者米安（Atif Mian）指出，在美国，家庭过度负债和需求下降都是本地化的。	Second, household over-indebtedness in the US, as well as the fall in demand, is localized, as my colleague Amir Sufi and his co-author, Atif Mian, have shown.
只要该地区各经济体继续欣欣向荣，就不会有人有动力认识 — — 更不用说纠正 — — 它们所面临的问题。	As long as the region’s economies were thriving, there was little incentive to identify – much less address – the problems facing them.
如果你认为一个和数个欧元区外围国家应该脱离欧元“休个假 ” ， 那你必定低估了这一事件的经济和政治后果。	Those who argue that one or more countries on the eurozone’s periphery should take a “holiday” from the euro underestimate both the economic and political repercussions of such a move.
美国第一任财政部长亚历山大·汉密尔顿认为，允许成本更低的进口品涌入会阻碍国内“婴儿”产业的发展，后者需要时间扩大规模从而将成本削减至有竞争力的水平。	Alexander Hamilton, the first US treasury secretary, argued that allowing lower-cost imports would impede the development of domestic “infant” industry, which needed time to scale up enough to reduce costs to a competitive level.
但就像我们近来所看到的那样，资本流动变幻莫测，如果撒哈拉以南非洲要充分利用目前的全球经济增长，那么决策者就必须在还有能力的情况下正面弥补公共债务漏洞。	But, as we have seen recently, capital flows are fickle, and if Sub-Saharan Africa is to take full advantage of the current global economic upswing, policymakers must tackle public-debt vulnerabilities head-on while they can.
俄罗斯正竭力把乌克兰重新揽入它的轨道，另一个古代日期的重要性因此显现：1709年，彼得大帝在波尔塔瓦战役（Battle of Poltava）中大破瑞典和哥萨克军队。	As Russia struggles to bring Ukraine back into its orbit, another ancient date looms large: 1709, when Czar Peter the Great crushed the Swedish and Cossack armies at the Battle of Poltava.
主流观点仍认为危机前的时期属于常态，至少从实体经济增长模式的角度看是如此，因此人们认定当前挑战在于用危机前模式重塑增长。	Because the dominant narrative still maintains that the pre-crisis period was normal, at least in terms of the growth pattern in the real economy, the perceived challenge is to restore growth according to the pre-crisis pattern.
该卫星发射计划在金正日时代就已开始谋划，显然，该计划是为了给缺少军队经验的新领导人提供“威武”的军事成就。	The decision to launch the satellite, which had been planned by Kim Jong-il, is clearly intended to provide a “heroic” martial achievement for a new leader who lacks any military experience.
我们无法确定选举观察团在韦德最终承认败于萨尔的结果中起到了什么作用，但知道选举正在接受地区监督一定集中了他的精力。	We cannot be sure what impact the mission had on Wade’s ultimate decision to concede defeat to Sall, but knowing that the region was watching must have focused his mind.
这是非常严重的问题，因为再过一年多时间，全世界的领导人将会在哥本哈根聚会，谈判京都议定书失败后的后续条约。	This matters, because in little more than a year, the world will sit down in Copenhagen to negotiate the follow-on treaty to the failed Kyoto Protocol.
由于美国当前的储蓄不足状况在去年不合时宜的减税时点下进一步恶化，美国只能更加依赖中国这样的盈余储蓄者来填补空缺。	With America’s saving shortfall now worsening in the aftermath of last year’s poorly timed tax cuts, the US will only become more reliant on surplus savers like China to fill the void.
同样，就什叶派而言，他们为什么不仿效北部的库尔德人的成功模式在南部建立自己的政治架构，而却要臣服于逊尼派的霸权呢？	Similarly, why should the Shias, for their part, submit to Sunni hegemony rather than building up their own political structure in the south, modeled on what the Kurds have already achieved in the north?
在寻找预测石油价格更完美方式的过程中，我从几年前开始注意五年远期石油价格与布伦特原油现货价格，即今天每桶石油价格的对比。	In my ongoing quest to become better at forecasting, I began, a few years ago, to pay attention to the five-year forward oil price as it compares to the Brent crude oil spot price, the price of a barrel of oil today.
1795年，斯宾汉兰（位于伯克夏的一个村庄）当局批准了一项根据资产状况调查发放的按比例工资补贴方案。	In 1795, the authorities of Speenhamland, a village in Berkshire, authorized a means-tested sliding scale of wage supplements.
在其1873年的作品《伦巴第街》中，英国商人兼《经济学家》的编辑沃尔特·白芝浩( Walter Bagehot ) ， 完美地描述了这种周期。	In his 1873 book Lombard Street , Walter Bagehot, the British businessman and editor of The Economist , described these cycles perfectly.
但是至少在两年的时间里，穆沙拉夫想要兼得鱼和熊掌。 他一方面按照美国的要求在与阿富汗接壤的西部边境上打击伊斯兰分子，另一方面则在与印度接壤的东部边境上扶植他们。	For at least two years, though, Musharraf tried to have it both ways, cracking down at America’s behest on the Islamists on Pakistan’s western border with Afghanistan while sponsoring them on the eastern border with India.
毫无疑问，长于数据管理和高级分析的员工供不应求，新出现的“译员 ” （ translator，即疏通IT和数据、分析和商业决策关系的人才）群体亦然。	To be sure, workers skilled in data management and advanced analytics are in short supply, as are members of an emerging class of “translators” – those whose talents bridge IT and data, analytics, and business decision-making.
华盛顿 — — 众所周知，已故英国历史学家埃里克·霍布斯鲍姆（Eric Hobsbawm）将1914年弗朗兹·费迪南大公遇刺和1991年苏联解体之间的这段时期称之为“浓缩的二十世纪 ” 。	WASHINGTON, DC – The late British historian Eric Hobsbawm famously called the period between Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s assassination in 1914 and the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991 the “short twentieth century.”
但最终，确保对发展援助或债务减免的额外财政支持只有三条途径：更高的税收，更多的债务（即对未来世代的更高税收 ） ， 和/或货币扩张。	But, in the end, there are only three ways to secure additional financing for development aid or debt relief: higher taxes, increased indebtedness (that is, higher taxes for future generations), and/or monetary expansion.
为了理解这一点，可以考虑以下问���：美国或其他国家认真地建议伊朗签署核不扩散条约 — — 即让伊朗放弃核弹是在什么时候。	To see this, consider the following question: When was the last time that the US or anyone else seriously proposed that India sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – that is, that India give up the Bomb.
他们主要研究巴西的诺梅尔卡多 - - - 这是股票交易市场为首次公开募股公司新设立的交易平台。 他们研究这一平台是如何保护那些给新入市的公司注入资金的投资者的利益。	An analysis by Ronald Gilson, Henry Hansmann, and Mariana Pargendler of Brazil’s Novo Mercado – the stock exchange’s special voluntary listing segment, which provides strong protections for investors in newly listed companies – supports this view.
没有它们的介入，巴沙尔政权极有可能仍然会采取高压政策；有了它们的参与，叙利亚变成了大规模死亡和毁灭之地。	Without their involvement, Assad’s regime would most likely have remained repressive; with their involvement, Syria has become a site of mass death and destruction.
左翼联盟的经济计划拒绝接受所谓的“三驾马车 ” （ IMF、欧洲央行和欧盟委员会）所支持 — — 或如某些人所说为三驾马车所实施 — — 的紧缩政策。	Syriza’s economic program rejects the austerity policies supported – or, some might say, imposed – by the so-called “troika” (the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission).
美国应当作出保证它不会利用朝鲜重新统一谋取战略优势，同时警示中国朝鲜目前的做法对其自身利益所构成的威胁。	The US should offer some reassurances that it would not exploit Korea’s reunification for strategic advantage, while warning China of the dangers North Korea’s current path poses to its own interests.
其实，哈马斯早在2012年就曾对迪莫纳反应堆发动过类似的袭击，1991年伊拉克也进行过同样的努力，目的是释放该反应堆内容物，从而对以色列民众造成辐射。	In fact, Hamas made similar attempts to attack the Dimona complex in 2012, as did Iraq in 1991, with the aim of releasing the site’s contents to inflict radiological damage on Israel’s population.
合规成本过高（特别是对于小型银行而言 ） ， 而对那些“太大而不能倒”的机构进行压力测试的初始门槛 — — 资产规模达500亿美元 — — 又太低。	Compliance costs were excessive, especially for small banks, and the original threshold for stress-testing “too big to fail” institutions – $50 billion in assets – was too low.
在这样一场至关重要的辩论中，所提供的信息质量尤为关键，那些反对干细胞研究的人一定会避免一场将迫使他们面对科学辩论的公众讨论。	In such a crucially important debate, the quality of the information offered is paramount, and it is no coincidence that those who oppose stem cell research prefer to avoid a public debate that would force them to confront scientific arguments.
欧盟三国 — — 英国、法国和德国 — — 正试图劝说伊朗放弃它的浓缩核计划，该计划将使得它在迅速退出条约后获得可使用的核弹材料。	Three European Union countries – Britain, France, and Germany – are trying to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear enrichment program, which would give it bomb material to use after a quick withdrawal from the treaty.
获得教育、资本、市场和技术能让妇女处理、打包和推销她们的产品，特别是面向非洲不断增加的中产阶级，从而同时改善收入和粮食供给。	Access to education, capital, markets, and technologies would allow women to process, package, and market their products, especially for Africa’s growing middle class, bolstering both earnings and food supplies.
没有哪个执政党能容忍如此无能的部长和领导；过去四年中，默克尔站在一旁冷眼目睹自由派在公众面前自寻死路。	No governing party can afford such woefully incompetent ministers and leadership; Merkel had merely to stand back and watch the liberals’ public suicide over the last four years.
目前，公司税收入占GDP的2 % ， 减税方案将让其下降到GDP的1%左右，按目前的经济规模计算，即1,900亿美元。	With corporate-tax revenue currently equal to 2% of GDP, the proposed rate cut would reduce revenue by about 1% of GDP, or $190 billion a year in today’s economy.
类似地，国家宇航局的重要地球科学研究项目也会分流给其他政府机构 — — 并削减预算，让它们无以为继。	Similarly, NASA’s important earth-science initiatives may be shunted off to other government agencies – where they can be defunded and left to die.
由于社会福利人为地给非熟练工人创造了高工资，并同步引发了过度的移民和失业问题，西欧福利国家已经经历了三十年的非直接移民。	Western Europe has already experienced three decades of indirect migration into the welfare state, as social benefits have created artificially high wages for the unskilled, simultaneously fueling excessive immigration and unemployment.
“好”好是税收改革势在必行，并且很可能由众议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）和他的团队执行 — — 为富人制定累进性较低、对资本较友好的税制，这是共和党长期追求的目标。	The “good” news is that tax reform was inevitable, and was likely to be undertaken by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and his staff – giving the rich the less progressive, more capital-friendly tax system that Republicans have long sought.
首先，暴跌的股价导致投资者账户中的股票下降到维持保证金水平以下，于是经纪商开始催缴保证金，迫使投资者甩卖更多资产以获得所需要的现金。	First, as plummeting stock prices caused the equity in investors’ accounts to fall below the maintenance margin, brokers began issuing margin calls, forcing investors to offload more assets to come up with the needed cash.
“在发达经济体，所有情景 ， ” 麦肯锡写道 ， “ 都表明到2030年将实现充分就业，但转型可能包括失业率高企和[趋于下降的]工资调整时期 ， ” 这取决于适应的速度。	“In advanced economies, all scenarios,” McKinsey writes, “result in full employment by 2030, but transition may include periods of higher unemployment and [downward] wage adjustments,” depending on the speed of adaptation.
由于还在超过一千个论点上未能达成共识，因此最近跟我交流过的所有政策制定者都说，他们看不到能在12月哥本哈根出台一个有实际意义之协议的可能性。	With more than a thousand points still to be agreed, all the policymakers I’ve spoken to recently say that they cannot see how a meaningful deal can be reached by December in Copenhagen.
特朗普更喜欢自由的会面，而会面所产生的书面结果可以非常模糊（如新加坡）或根本不存在（如赫尔辛基 ） 。	Trump prefers free-flowing sessions in which the written outcome can be vague, as it was in Singapore, or non-existent, as it was in Helsinki.
问题在于一旦灾难来袭政府很可能面对高额成本，也就是说政府要在最必要的时刻为保持财政地位付出更高的期权价值。	The problem is that the government likely faces high costs if a disaster strikes, which implies a high option value to preserving fiscal space for when it is most needed.
奥巴马担任总统、加之中国的崛起、非西方移民知名度大增和女权主义的挑战，显示出世界发生了多么大的变化。	Obama’s presidency, along with the rise of China, the visibility of non-Western immigrants, and the challenges of feminism, showed how much the world has changed.
穆斯林世界中出现了数十篇研究杰哈德战略的文本，其中在西方名气最大的当数《野性的管理 》 ， 究其原因只是因为这篇文章被译成英文并被公开发表。	Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies. The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public.
各国政府（虽然目前焦点都集中在希腊和意大利身上，但它们并不是孤例）对过多的人许下了过多也过久的承诺。	Governments (the focus is on Greece and Italy at the moment, but they are not alone) have promised too much, to too many, for too long.
合在一起，这两种全球化反对力量解释了为何即使在长期以来一直鼓吹加强开放的西方发达国家，阻碍商品、资本和劳动力自由流动的保护主义壁垒也一直存在。	Taken together, the two types of backlash against globalization explain why protectionist barriers to the free flow of goods, capital, and labor have been erected even in developed Western countries that long advocated greater openness.
此外，由于中国的债务绝大多数是国有银行对国有企业的贷款，因此存款人和投资者都很有信心（不管对错）地认为他们的资产有政府的隐性担保。	Moreover, because China’s debt consists overwhelmingly of loans by state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises, depositors and investors feel confident (rightly or wrongly) that their assets carry an implicit government guarantee.
"我在Lexis-Nexis数据库里搜索了全世界英文报纸中关于""外包 "" 、 ""工作""和""印度""三个关键词的新闻报道。"	"I searched the Lexis-Nexis database of English-language newspaper stories around the world that contained all three of the words ""outsourcing,"" ""jobs,"" and ""India."""
尼日尔三角洲的石油清理行动给尼日利亚、石油产业以及国际社会提供了一个理想的机会来向世界昭示 — — 一个新的时代已经到来了。	The cleanup of the Niger Delta provides an ideal opportunity for Nigeria, the oil industry, and the international community to show convincingly that a new age has dawned.
而我之所以认为这场战争不可能获胜的原因，是因为它违反了“鲍威尔法则 ” ， 而这条法则是 18 年前时任美国参谋长联席会议主席的柯林斯·鲍威尔根据第一次海湾战争的经验总结出来的。	And I believe that it is unwinnable because it fails to comply with the tenets of the Powell Doctrine, elaborated 18 years ago by Colin Powell, then Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, in relation to the first Gulf War.
事实上，直到1994—1995年比索危机爆发，世界才发现墨西哥私有银行通过表外借贷（衍生品）承担了巨大的货币风险。	Indeed, it was not until after the eruption of the 1994-1995 peso crisis that the world learned that Mexico’s private banks had taken on a significant amount of currency risk through off-balance-sheet borrowing (derivatives).
从撒切尔夫人引入人头税到布莱尔支持美国领导的支持伊拉克战争，再到卡梅伦决定举行英国退出公投，这些决定破坏了英国的制度。	From Margaret Thatcher’s introduction of a poll tax to Tony Blair’s support for the US-led invasion of Iraq, to David Cameron’s decision to hold the Brexit referendum, such decisions have undermined the British system.
具体而言，希腊及其债权人必须在一套可信的减债计划上达成一致，该计划要支持重启希腊增长引擎、使其内部债务与其能力相符所需要的国内改革。	Specifically, Greece and its creditors must agree to a credible debt-reduction program that would support the domestic reforms needed to re-invigorate Greece’s growth engines and place its internal obligations in line with its capabilities.
如果如今安倍晋三重启这一方案，将有助于打破他在试图让日本成为能够参与地区集体防务的“正常”国家的过程中所面临的地区敌对情绪。	If Abe revived this initiative today, he could help to dampen the regional antagonism he faces in trying to make Japan a “normal” country, with a military capable of participating in collective regional defense.
几十年来，伊斯兰堡和喀布尔政府在剿灭这两个集团的据点方面收效甚微，他们能够自由穿行于巡防松弛的边界间。	Over the decades, the governments in Islamabad and Kabul have done little to remove the sanctuaries established by the two groups, whose members freely cross the poorly patrolled frontier.
其后随着市场机制在中国的引入及发展，催生了价格双轨制，使得那些有能力获得产品配额的人只需支付较低的价格。	As the free market developed, a dual-price system emerged, in which those with access to quota-allocated goods paid less.
在边境面对毒品、传染病和恐怖主义变得漏洞百出的世界里，美国必须协助成立国际联盟和机构，应对共同面临的挑战和威胁。	In a world where borders are more porous than ever to everything from drugs to infectious diseases to terrorism, America must help build international coalitions and institutions to address shared threats and challenges.
俄罗斯电视评论员把支持欧洲导向的乌克兰的瑞典以及已经被纳入瑞典轨道的波兰和立陶宛称为想为波尔塔瓦战役复仇。	Russian television commentators describe the countries most engaged in supporting a European-oriented Ukraine – Sweden, along with Poland and Lithuania, which had been brought into the Swedish orbit – as seeking revenge for Poltava.
但最近《金融时报 》 / 哈里斯民意调查在美国、德国、法国、英国、意大利和西班牙的结果却显示，认为全球化利大于弊的人数上升了近三倍。	But a recent Financial Times/Harris poll in the US, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain found people nearly three times more likely to say that globalization is negative than positive.
柏林—希腊经济危机还在肆虐，从保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）等诺贝尔经济学奖获得者到美国财政部长杰克·卢等名声显赫人士纷纷呼吁采取更宽大的援助条件和债务纾困。	BERLIN – With Greece’s economic crisis still raging, prominent voices, ranging from Nobel laureate economists like Paul Krugman to officials like US Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew, are calling for more lenient bailout terms and debt relief.
此外，在哈马斯与埃及穆斯林兄���会关系密切的问题上（隶属于后者的政党将穆尔西推上了总统宝座 ） ， 以色列也保持了克制，没有对来自加沙的恐怖主义和火箭袭击反应过激。	And, in view of Hamas’s close links with Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, whose political party backed Morsi’s successful presidential run, Israel has restrained its response to terrorist and rocket attacks from Gaza.
如果脆弱国家和国际捐助者将更多资源用于强化幼儿、小学和中学等教育的三大支柱，那么全世界的严重脱轨国家都将最终有机会重新回到轨道上。	If fragile states and international donors directed more resources to strengthening education’s three pillars – early, primary, and secondary – the world’s SOTCs would finally have a chance to get back on track.
事实上，美国接受该地区的伊斯兰政党 — — 从突尼斯复兴运动到埃及穆斯林兄弟会 — — 这一事实表明对伊斯兰组织的怀疑正在消退。	Indeed, America’s acceptance of Islamist parties in the region, from Ennahda in Tunisia to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, suggests that skepticism of Islamist groups may be losing ground.
通过接受这类学校所代表的隔离主义的观念，英国人现在在说的是 ： “ 这是你的身份，你不能再有其他身份了 。 ”	By embracing the kind of separatism that such schools represent, the British are now saying, “This is your identity and you can have nothing else.”
但这种处事方式在美国共和党，特别是其茶党派系看来无异于一种诅咒，他们可能让被中国日益增长的军事实力弄得紧张兮兮的众多亚洲人丧失勇气。	But such approaches are anathema to the US Republican Party, and to its Tea Party faction in particular, and they might unnerve the many Asians who are nervous at China’s growing military might.
《世界经济展望》强调这些因素的暂时性质，认定尽管世界GDP增长在上半年只有大约3 % ， 但会在下半年加速。	Emphasizing the temporary nature of these factors, the reports insist that, though world GDP growth amounted to roughly 3% during the first half of the year, it will pick up in the second half.
这些移民中有三分之二生活在发达国家，即生产率往往是最高的地区，因此他们的工作影响能得到最大化，形成影响深远的经济收益。	Because roughly two-thirds of these migrants reside in developed countries, where productivity tends to be highest, they are maximizing the impact of their work, with far-reaching economic benefits.
在所有这些例子中，经济失败以及穷人和年轻人看不见机会和希望助长了政治和宗教极端主义和对西方的仇恨，一些国家甚至因此兴起了恐怖主义。	In all of these cases, economic failure and a lack of opportunities and hope for the poor and young are fueling political and religious extremism, resentment of the West and, in some cases, outright terrorism.
里根时代的国务卿乔治·舒尔茨曾把他的角色比作园丁 — — “不断地培育复杂的行动者、利益和目标的复杂综合体 ” 。	Former Secretary of State George Shultz, who served under Ronald Reagan, once compared his role to gardening –“the constant nurturing of a complex array of actors, interests, and goals.”
最新的ABC新闻台 - 《 华盛顿邮报》民调显示，39%的美国人目前认为保护隐私比调查恐怖威胁更重要，而2002年只有18 % 。	A recent ABC News-Washington Post poll showed that 39% of Americans now say that protecting privacy is more important than investigating terrorist threats, up from only 18% in 2002.
如果欧洲妇女在更高质量的工作中工作更长的时间，那么，这将会刺激像清洁和托儿等服务性工作，从而降低低技能工人的失业率。	If women in Europe work more hours in better quality jobs, it will stimulate demand for service jobs like cleaning and child care, thus reducing unemployment among low-skilled workers.
特里谢在记者见面会上对这一消息断章取义，令人听起来似乎是ECB想要将政策转变为准备降息（easing bias）而不是“等着瞧”的中立。	Trichet somehow garbled the Council’s message in his press conference, making it sound as if the ECB wanted to shift to an easing bias instead of “wait and see” neutrality.
但只要想一想权力在加密货币“矿工 ” 、 交易所、开发者和财富所有者手中大量集中，就能看出区块链与去中心化和民主根本无关；它只和贪婪有关。	But one need only consider the massive centralization of power among cryptocurrency “miners,” exchanges, developers, and wealth holders to see that blockchain is not about decentralization and democracy; it is about greed.
但仍存在巨大的不确定性，不仅是关于最近沪深交易所崩盘的原因的不确定性，还包括关于此次崩盘对中国金融改革意味着什么的不确定性。	But considerable uncertainty remains, not only about what caused the recent plunge in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, but also about what the episode will mean for China’s financial-reform efforts.
到目前为止，随着总统选举委员会的负责人在埃及电视上宣布拒绝对选举过程实施全民监督，形势似乎进入了一个平局。	Thus far, a standoff looks likely, as the head of the presidential election commission has stated publicly on Egyptian television that he refuses all citizen monitoring of the election process.
当然，如果希腊的债权人接受债务减免，国际货币基金组织的贷款将变得更加安全 — — 利益冲突也会因此减少。	Of course, if Greece’s creditors accept a haircut, the IMF’s credits would become more secure – hence the conflict of interest.
这意味着需要改变目前政府预算赤字下降的趋势。 中国预算赤字从2013年占GDP的2%下降到去年的1.8 % 。	This would mean reversing the recent decline in the government budget deficit, which narrowed to 1.8% last year, from 2% of GDP in 2013.
由于国际银行不管位居何处都喜欢用美元借贷，因此这些互换安排相当于让外国中央银行能够在紧急情况时向本地银行提供美元贷款。	Because international banks, wherever they are located, tend to borrow in dollars, the swap arrangements allow foreign central banks to lend dollars to their local banks in times of emergency.
但是，如果没有美国的军事支持或间接（在某些情形中是隐藏的）政治支持，你很难想象英国、法国和以色列会做出这些高风险动作。	Yet, without direct US military support or indirect (and in some cases implicit) political support, it is difficult to imagine that such risky operations would have been launched.
2010年，文特里亚公司向美国食品药品监管局（Food and Drug Administration，FDA）申请承认这些蛋白质“总体安全 ” （ 一个艺术性的监管用词 ） ， 结果没有得到��何回复。	When Ventria approached the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010 for recognition that these proteins are “generally recognized as safe” (a regulatory term of art), it received no response.
因此，在许多政策问题上，所有人的目光都集中在众议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）身上，他可能成为制衡克林顿的力量 — — 有时候与克林顿合作，也可能为特朗普指引方向，成为他的经常性伙伴。	As a result, on many policy issues, all eyes will be on House Speaker Paul Ryan, who would likely operate either as a counterbalance – and occasional partner – to Clinton, or as a guide and more regular partner for Trump.
中国通过建立强大的劳动密集型工业基础、将工人从农业转移到制造业和建筑业以及改善全部门生产率实现了农业经济的转型。	China transformed its agrarian economy by building a strong, labor-intensive industrial base, shifting workers from agriculture to manufacturing and construction, and improving productivity across all sectors.
克林顿不需要与同僚辩论，相反，她需要确保六方框架中的其他国家，特别是中国和南朝鲜，和美国保持一致的步调。	Rather than debate with her counterparts, Clinton needs to ensure that other countries in the six-party framework, especially China and South Korea, are on the same page as the US.
在中国崩溃情形中，这一出口需求将干涸 — — 大约会将2016年美国经济增长率拉低0.2—0.3个百分点，而美国经济原本已相当疲软，预计增长率只有1.6%左右。	In a China-implosion scenario, that export demand would all but dry up – knocking approximately 0.2-0.3 percentage points off already subpar US economic growth of around 1.6% in 2016.
如果认识正确，同时致力于根本性、哪怕是渐进的变化，数字平台的社会和政治影响力可以创造 — — 或至少是改善当今陷入困境的民主体制的安全环境。	With the right insights, and a commitment to fundamental, if incremental, change, the social and political impact of digital platforms can be made safe – or at least safer – for today’s beleaguered democracies.
神经科学 — — 关于大脑，即那个人类脑袋内部的器官，如何工作的科学 — — 正在改变我们关于人类如何决策的看法。	Neuroscience – the science of how the brain, that physical organ inside one’s head, really works – is beginning to change the way we think about how people make decisions.
他随后拒绝接受国际《海洋法公约 》 ； 反对世界银行推进节能减排；命令美国撤出联合国教科文组织；还跟特朗普一样发誓要减少美国对国际组织的贡献。	He subsequently rejected the international Law of the Sea Treaty; opposed the World Bank’s promotion of energy conservation; withdrew the US from UNESCO; and, like Trump, pledged to reduce America’s contributions to international organizations.
20世纪20年代早期的大通胀期间，最严重的时候物价一天涨好几回，打垮了中产阶级，动摇了政治稳定，为希特勒的最终上台创造了机会。	The Great Inflation of the early 1920’s, which culminated in a hyper-inflation in which prices changed several times daily, destroyed the middle classes and bred the political instability that eventually opened the way to Hitler’s rise.
接下来几周将会最终解决巴尔干半岛留下的最后的领土问题，不管是以哪种方式。 二十世纪九十年代在那里发生的战争最终导致了北约1995年在波斯尼亚、1999年在科索沃的介入。	The next few weeks will see the resolution, one way or another, of the last territorial issues remaining in the Balkans, where the wars of the 1990’s ended with NATO interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999).
确实，新兴市场和富含石油的国家的储蓄率自二十世纪七十年代以来是上升的，但是它被发达国家下降的储蓄率抵消了。	True, savings rates in emerging markets and oil-rich countries have been increasing since 1970, and especially in the last few years, but this has been offset by declining saving rates in advanced countries.
如果你想了解他们的运作方式，合理的方法是从简单的小型设备着手，而后对其进行系统性分拆直到它不再履行任何功能。	If you want to understand how they work, it makes sense to start with the simplest and smallest device, then systematically carve off pieces until it stops working.
考虑到新成员国加入欧盟之前的高期望值和欧盟吝啬的现实态度，即使一种反欧洲的情绪很快在上述国家滋生也不足为奇了。	Given the high hopes that preceded ascension to the EU, and the stingy attitude of the Union to its new members, it should not surprise anyone if an anti-European reaction soon starts to brew in these countries.
如果国家预计会经历自然风险，比如破坏性暴风季或大地震，那么投资时间和资源用于为冲击做好准备就能够拯救生命、保护社会免受其他损失。	If countries expect to experience natural hazards, such as violent storm seasons or major earthquakes, then investing time and resources in preparing for shocks will save lives and protect communities from other losses.
“经济爱国主义”是法国总理多米尼克·德维尔潘（Dominique de Villepin）在2005年7月百事公司传闻收购达能集团后创造出来的口号，也可能是对上述政治责任的最佳概括。	“Economic patriotism,” the slogan coined by France’s Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin following PepsiCo’s rumored attempt in July 2005 to takeover Danone, perhaps best encapsulates the political imperative.
如果欧洲要克服当前的金融约束、获得满足其新角色要求的军事能力和协作水平，就必须更有效地集中和共享它的资源。	If Europe is to overcome its current financial constraints and acquire the military capacity and level of coordination needed to fulfill its new role, it must pool and share its resources more effectively.
事实上，欧洲专利局（EPO）从未特别关注过评估其所授专利的道德影响问题；在它看来，只有发明真正离谱的极端情况才涉及破坏“公共秩序”的问题。	In fact, the European Patent Office (EPO) is not particularly committed to assessing the moral implications of the patents it grants; in its view, “ordre public” would be violated only in the extreme case of a truly outrageous invention.
应当以回收二氧化碳经济可行的方式建造新型电厂，而建造新的管道将二氧化碳运送到储存地点，设计新的监控系统来控制泄漏。	New kinds of power plants will have to be built to make carbon capture economical, new pipelines will have to be built to transport the CO2 to storage sites, and new monitoring systems will have to be designed to control leaks.
比如，在许多难民来源国，同性恋、双性恋、两性人和阴阳人（LGBTI）的健康问题仍然是一个禁忌，即使在医生中间也不例外。	For example, in many countries where refugees originate, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) health concerns remain taboo, even among medical professionals.
盟国在二战中的胜利和《大西洋宪章》所带来的是一项全球新政：通过同意遵守国际规则并借助国际机构行事，各国可以共享战后的繁荣。	What came of the Allies’ victory in World War II and the Atlantic Charter was a Global New Deal: by agreeing to play by international rules and institutions, countries could participate in the post-war bonanza.
新环境条约的投资保护条款也应该剔除化石燃料项目，如法国总统马克龙在9月的联合国大会上所提出的《全球环境公约 》 （ Global Pact for the Environment ） 。	Fossil-fuel projects could also be exempted from investment protection in new environmental treaties, such as the Global Pact for the Environment presented by French President Emmanuel Macron to the UN General Assembly in September.
笔者认为这项事务并非与伊斯兰教本身有关：在欧洲，天主教在一段长的历史时期内都是民主和自由的最大敌人。	The issue, one should emphasize, is not Islam as such: in Europe, the Catholic Church was for a long time the greatest enemy of democracy and liberalism.
在共和党候选人竞争中领跑的唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）一再建议沿着墨西哥边境全线建立一座墙。	The Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, has repeatedly proposed building a wall along the entire border with Mexico.
私有企业的投资人应该表现得更加情愿地拿出钱凑足350亿美元，因为当金融资产价格在它们目前的价值与正常价值没有任何差异时，它们就能赚上一笔。	Private-sector investors ought to be more than willing to kick in that $35 billion, for they stand to make a fortune when financial asset prices close some of the gap between their current and normal values.
欧盟的某些人 — — 主要在法国、德国和奥地利 — — 似乎对这个问题上可能发生的冲突幸灾乐祸，认为这样会促使土耳其放弃对加入欧盟的追求。	Some in the EU – mainly in France, Germany, and Austria – seem smugly pleased by the prospect of a clash on this issue, believing it will force Turkey to give up its drive for membership.
目前，世界经济正处于动荡之中，台湾和中国大陆及亚洲地区其他伙伴国之间的正式经济联系就显得更为重要，只有大家共同努力，才能将危机的损害降到最低。	At this time of economic turmoil around the world, increasing Taiwan’s formal economic links with China and its regional partners can only benefit everyone involved, because an inevitable side-effect will be a lessening of tension.
但这一不可持续的扩张需要外国借款支持，通货膨胀率也高攀至15%以上，经常项目赤字超过GDP的5 % 。	But this unsustainable expansion was financed by foreign borrowing, and the inflation rate has since skyrocketed to over 15%, with the current-account deficit exceeding 5% of GDP.
目前，联邦税占GDP之比为18.3 % ， 预计未来几十年内将维持在这一水平，除非税收规则或税率发生改变。	Federal taxes now take 18.3% of GDP and are projected to remain at that level for the next decade, unless tax rules or rates are changed.
俄罗斯官方观点着眼于“EEU和丝绸之路经济带互相渗透、互相融合 ” ， 形成一个“大欧亚 ” ， 为“俄罗斯和中国提供稳定发展的安全的共同周边环境 。 ”	Official Russian opinion looks forward to “the interpenetration and integration of the EEU and the Silk Road Economic Belt” into a “Greater Eurasia,” which will afford a “steady developing safe common neighborhood of Russia and China.”
不管未来几年医生使用什么预测方法，也许都能使他们能够告知存在温和认知损伤的患者短期内罹患阿尔茨海默症的概率。	Whichever predictive methods doctors use over the next few years will probably enable them to inform those patients with mild cognitive impairment about their chances of developing Alzheimer’s in the short term.
更糟糕的是，新天然气生产往往不能取代煤炭，而是会取代风能和太阳能项目，后两者现在在许多地区已经比煤炭和天然气更加便宜。	Worse, new gas production often displaces not coal, but wind- and solar-energy projects, both of which are now cheaper than coal and gas in many regions.
在2012年7月，法国和阿尔及利亚将举办庆祝阿尔及利亚共和国成立50周年的庆典，而这场庆典恰好是在法国总统大选结束之后进行。	In July 2012, France and Algeria will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the birth of the Algerian Republic.
在演讲的“不设限问答”缓解，奥哈尼安没有接受关于Pizzagate 、 “ The_Donald”和仇恨言论的问题。	During an “Ask Me Anything” session after his speech, Ohanian took no questions about Pizzagate, “The_Donald,” or hate speech.
毫不奇怪，这加剧了通胀担忧，1月份消费者物价指数（CPI）同比涨幅仅0.8 % ， 而生产者物价降幅扩大至4.3 % 。	Unsurprisingly, this has exacerbated the fear of deflation, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising by just 0.8% year on year in January, and the annual decline in producer prices steepening, to 4.3%.
哥本哈根共识中心研究了最佳研发机会，结果刚刚由英国智库政策交流中心（Policy Exchange）发布。	The Copenhagen Consensus has studied the best R&D opportunities, and the results have just been published by the British Policy Exchange think tank.
而令我记忆最深刻的，是那些成百上千张贴满墙壁的囚徒和受害者的黑白照片—人类苦难的恐怖蒙太奇，至今仍在我脑海中挥之不去。	Mostly, I remember the hundreds of black and white mug shots of prisoners and victims that covered every inch of the walls – a ghastly montage of human suffering that haunts me to this day.

在这一“高度全球化”时期，世界上两个收入得以增加的群体是富国和穷国中最顶层的那1％富人，还有一些亚洲国家（中国，印度，印尼，泰国和越南）的中产阶级。	During this period of “high globalization,” the two segments of the world making gains were the wealthiest 1% in rich and poor countries and the middle class in a few Asian countries – namely China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
这些探索是最近才开展的，原因是到目前为止，以整组基因的方式进行基因不平衡性全面评定的技术还达不到要求。	This discovery was made recently because until now, the technology was not available to comprehensively assess genomic imbalances in a genome-wide fashion.

到目前为止，解决冲突的工作一直局限在奥斯陆框架的范围内，该协议规定巴勒斯坦民众的自决之路重要性大于就边界问题、定居点和返回权等问题达成协议。	Until now, efforts to resolve the conflict have been confined to the contours of the Oslo model, according to which the route to Palestinian self-determination traverses bilateral agreement on borders, settlements, territory, and the right of return.
埃尔多安继续将库尔德人民民主党视为贱民，而且根本不去考虑与库尔德反政府武装之间达成和平，甚至热衷于重新开战。	Erdoğan continues to treat the HDP as a pariah. And, far from contemplating peace with the Kurdish rebels, he seems to relish the resumption of war with them.
