但更有可能普京是因为国内原因才吞并了克里米亚 — — 为了将俄罗斯人的注意力从国家经济不景气上移开，也是为了一雪亲欧示威者推翻他所支持的乌克兰政府的耻辱。	But it is more likely that Putin acted for domestic reasons – to distract Russians’ attention from their country’s failing economy and to salve the humiliation of watching pro-European demonstrators oust the Ukrainian government he backed.
背后的操作机制在技术上非常复杂，但由此得出的结果却相当直接：那就是一页文字，其中包含10个蓝色的链接。	The engineering behind it was technically complicated, but what you got was pretty rough: a page of text, broken up by ten blue links.
银行必须改变奖励过度冒险的薪酬模式；保护揭发者；招聘和培训合乎职业伦理的员工；并确保董事会扮演更加活跃的监督角色。	Banks must change compensation practices that reward excessive risk; protect whistleblowers; recruit and train staff to reflect proper ethics; and ensure that their boards of directors play a more active oversight role.
更不用说新兴市场国家的政客们没能明白的一点：即便美国袖手旁观，单方面降低他们过度的进口限制也会是个好主意。	And this is not to mention emerging market politicians’ failure to grasp that unilaterally reducing their excessive import restrictions would be a good idea even if rich countries sat on their hands.
然而，如今看来，美国的银行反倒不是危机的最大受害者，其中颇有一些 — — 包括几家出了名的问题银行 — — 居然在危机中坐大，成了长时段上的赢家。	But the banks that were most affected were elsewhere, and the long-term winners will be a few American banks – including some of the most notoriously weak banks – which will get bigger as a result of the crisis.
“我们不会在意是亚美尼亚人还是土耳其人 — — 只会在意是不是最好的 ， ” 一位土耳其与会者这样说。	“We weren’t focused on being Armenian or Turkish – just on being the best,” a Turkish participant noted.
然而听任赤字无限扩大或在提振就业和增长的进一步刺激过程中不断累积也会招致衰退，因为债券市场上的“志愿巡逻队”会把借贷成本推得老高。	But recession could also result if deficits are allowed to fester, or are increased with additional stimulus to boost jobs and growth, because bond-market vigilantes might push borrowing costs higher.
比如，汇回海外收入所享受的免税期被称为“美国就业创造法 ” （ American Job Creation Act ） 。	For example, a tax holiday to repatriate foreign earnings was called the “American Job Creation Act.”
特朗普团队的计划必须认识到，在这一漫长的货币扩张期内，金融市场和资源配置都被扭曲了，这恶化了财富不平等程度。	The plan must recognize that, during this protracted period of monetary expansion, both financial markets and resource-allocation have been distorted, worsening wealth inequality.
吸引和留住这些外国人才在英国退出后将变得更加困难，流向英国的欧盟公认不再能够随身转移养老金权利，其他单一市场的便利条件也将失去。	Attracting and retaining this foreign talent will become harder after Brexit, when EU workers moving to Britain will no longer be able to take their pension rights with them, and the other conveniences of a single labor market are lost.
中国以其一贯的敏感应对石原慎太郎的主张：拒绝接受石原慎太郎之子、日本主要反对党自民党总干事的访问计划。	China reacted to Ishihara’s proposal with its usual sensitivity: it refused to receive the scheduled visit of Ishihara’s son, who is Secretary-General of Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party, the country’s main opposition party.

同样，古兰经规定必须有四名目击证人才能证实通奸罪，但仅仅怀疑一名女性可能发生过违法性行为就足以按照习惯法的规则对其处以石刑。	Similarly, whereas the Koran requires four eyewitnesses as proof of adultery, mere suspicion of some unregulated, potentially sexual conduct by a woman warrants stoning under customary law.

据气候变化政府间委员会的数据，甲烷的吸热作用可以在20年时间里比二氧化碳厉害86倍，它造成了人为引起的变暖的五分之一。	According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane is 86 times more potent than CO2 as a heat-trapping gas over a 20-year period, and is responsible for about a fifth of the warming caused by humans.
例如有些记者遭到逮捕，罪名是在“Ergenekon”组织的授意下撰写文章和书籍，但问题是官方在多年调查之后连这个所谓的恐怖组织是否存在都尚未弄清	For example, journalists have been imprisoned for producing articles and books at the behest of an alleged terrorist organization called “Ergenekon,” whose existence has yet to be confirmed, despite years of investigation.
在美国，预算自动减赤（sequester）和其他税收和支出政策导致了巨大的2012—2014年财政拖累。	In the US, a budget sequester and other tax and spending policies led to a sharp fiscal drag in 2012-2014.
只有少数国家在核不扩散条约框架外开发核武器，而全面禁止核试验条约让核试验的数量从十年平均500起下降到几乎为零。	Only a handful of countries have developed nuclear weapons outside of the NPT, and the CTBT has reduced the number of nuclear tests from an average of 500 per decade to a mere trickle.

我们不需要等待十年去弄清楚欧盟是否可以帮助稳定乌克兰，同时还得面临领导层因其民主和法治精神的基本价值而感到威胁的俄罗斯。	We will not have to wait a decade to find out whether the EU can help to stabilize Ukraine while confronting a Russia whose leadership feels threatened by its fundamental values of democracy and the rule of law.
在美国总统特朗普威胁挑起贸易战、将欧洲拱手推给俄罗斯总统普京的复仇主义掠夺行为时，英国脱欧单干的时机非常危险。	And with US President Donald Trump threatening to start trade wars and abandon Europe to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s revanchist predations, this is an especially dangerous time for the UK to go it alone.
他强调降低国内税收，宣称这将释放新一波企业家精神；他提出要以保护主义方向重新谈判贸易协议，让就业机会留在美国。	He stresses cutting domestic taxes, which he asserts will unleash a new flurry of entrepreneurism, and renegotiating trade deals in a protectionist direction, to keep jobs in America.
萨默斯在最近的国际货币基金组织（IMF）会议上指出，到2005年左右，美国新投资的平均预期回报比可以预见的所有美联储基准利率降息都要低。	By the mid-2000’s, Summers argued at a recent International Monetary Fund conference, the average prospective return on new investment in the United States had fallen below any feasible reduction in the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate.
但是，由于我们的努力和长期一起的共同生活，最重要的是，由于家人和好友的支持，我们从沮丧、愤怒到悲伤的情绪反应得到了缓解和升华。	But our emotional reactions, from frustration and anger to sadness, have been cushioned and sublimated by our work, the long rhythm of our days together, and, above all, by the support of family and close friends.
货币是一种公共产品，它允许每个人进行自由交换，而不必诉诸传统社会所依赖的那种模糊且低效的以物易物模式。	Money is a public good that allows individuals to enter into free exchange without having to resort to the kind of imprecise, inefficient bartering on which traditional societies depended.
艾滋病运动的教训可以写全整个字母表，但在H结尾比较合适，因为人权推动了艾滋病响应机制，也应该推动NCD响应机制。	The list of AIDS lessons could continue throughout the alphabet, but ending with “H” is apt, given that human rights drove the response, and should drive the response to NCDs.
尽管一些医院仍饱受人手不足之苦，但政府已经开始填补这一空缺，启动了一项从20多家美国机构聘请专家协助本国临床专家的计划。	While some hospitals still suffer from staff shortages, the government has sought to patch these holes through an initiative that employs faculty from over 20 US institutions to assist in training our clinical specialists.
那场名为伊拉克战争的历史性失败、世俗阿拉伯国家主义的终结和高涨的石油和天然气价格给该地区带来了深远的变化。	The historical failure named Iraq war, the demise of secular Arab nationalism and the soaring oil and gas prices have wrought profound changes in the region.
但如果欧盟国家开始竞争中国的市场份额，那么俄罗斯可能很快就会不敌诱惑而向北京的共产党政权出售他们最好的武器。	However, if EU countries start competing for a share of the Chinese market, the Russians could soon be tempted to sell their best arms to the communist regime in Beijing.

除非很快采取变化，否则作为这一模式的基础的外汇机制和资本管制将会变得过于根深蒂固，调整的机会窗口也会错失。	Unless change comes soon, the foreign-exchange regime and capital controls on which the model relies will become too deeply entrenched, and the window of opportunity for adjustment will be missed.
特朗普则没有表现出任何策略思维迹象；事实上，他的政策冲动有可能给叙利亚挖下一个更深的深坑，美国、英国和俄罗斯都会深陷其中。	Trump has shown no evidence of it; in fact, his policy impulsiveness risks digging an even deeper hole for Syria, into which the US, Britain, and Russia will be sucked.
在2003年7月1日，香港回归六周年的纪念日当天，有近百万人走上香港街头举行反对一项反颠覆立法的和平抗议。 该项立法本可能会侵蚀新闻、宗教和集会的自由。	On July 1, 2003, the sixth anniversary of the handover, nearly a million people took to Hong Kong’s streets in a peaceful protest against an anti-subversion bill that would have eroded freedom of the press, of religion, and of association.

无奈欧洲的政治机构不愿采用上述任何一个选项，而是选择去敷衍拖延希腊的破产状况 — — 并假装已经通过新一批的贷款解决了这一问题。	Alas, Europe’s political establishment, unwilling to adopt either option, has chosen to extend Greece’s insolvency – which it pretends has been resolved through new loan tranches.
政治伊斯兰教形式多种多样，其中就包括1928年成立的穆斯林兄弟会（Muslin Brotherhood ） 。	The phenomenon took many forms, including the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928.

但是，如果中东局势恶化，构成联合国五大常任理事国的集体责任感，那么，如今中俄两国的差别在明天也就不再重要。	But the differences between Russia and China today may prove to be less significant tomorrow if the deterioration in the Middle East imposes a sense of collective responsibility on all five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
下一任总统能否在不挑起军事干预和圣战的情况下宣传民主价值观，并同时在建立和维护相互依赖世界所需机构的过程中成功地成为非霸权主义主导？	Can the next president promote democratic values without military intervention and crusades, and at the same time take a non-hegemonic lead in establishing and maintaining the institutions needed for a world of interdependence?
共和党的尼克松1968年当选美国总统，靠的是缩减民主党的扩张性大社会（Great Society）计划。	The Republican Richard Nixon was elected US President in 1968 on a platform of scaling down the Democrats’ expensive Great Society programs.

一些人认为政策可以调整从而避免带来有意义的伤害，这通常是因为政策所产生的经济条件方面的改善将消除进一步刺激的需要。	Some believe that policy can be calibrated to stop short of inflicting meaningful harm, usually because the resulting improvement in economic conditions will obviate the need for continued stimulus.
中国正在受到停止在世界货币市场内支撑美元的干涉政策的压力，其反对者强调这样的政策正在给其他国家造成多大的伤害。	China is being pressured to halt its interventions to prop up the US dollar in world currency markets, with opponents emphasizing how much harm the policy is causing to other countries.
金砖国家的崛起说到底是世界经济的幸事，但皮克的兴起带来了实实在在的威胁 — — 特别是当他们开始将对抗式方针用于外交事务和全球经济治理中时。	Unlike the emergence of the BRICS, which ultimately was a boon to the world economy, the rise of the PEKOs poses a real threat – especially as they begin to apply their confrontational approach to foreign affairs and global economic governance.
实际上，黎巴嫩和加沙的危机让人意识到，如果希望回到和平进程中，关押在以色列的阿拉伯囚犯以及以色列的单边主义这两大痛苦的问题必须得到解决。	Indeed, the crises in Lebanon and Gaza have brought about a realization that two festering issues – Arab prisoners in Israel, and Israeli unilateralism – must be resolved if there is to be any hope of a return to the peace process.
没有吸取20世纪30年代最有力的教训之一（是的，就是凯恩斯主义 ） — —财政政策是摆脱流动性陷阱的唯一办法 — — 也许是最大的悲剧。	Failing to heed one of the most powerful (yes, Keynesian) lessons of the 1930s – that fiscal policy is the only way out of a liquidity trap – could be the greatest tragedy of all.
如此严重的收入失衡不仅与人们普遍信奉的社会公平和机会均等准则无法匹配；更对美国的经济和民主制度造成了严重威胁。	Such a high level of inequality is not only incompatible with widely held norms of social justice and equality of opportunity; it poses a serious threat to America’s economy and democracy.

两国政府正在考虑的诸多非市场的“贸易措施”或许会让双边贸易失衡下降，但同时也会使它们与世界其它国家的失衡加大。 这种拆东墙补西墙的解决方法将令两国及世界其它国家的消费者甚至企业蒙受损失。	The non-market “trade remedies” being considered by the US and China might produce a smaller trade imbalance between the two economies, but at the cost of a larger imbalance with the rest of the world.
另外，除了政治的考量之外，一些以美元为主要储备货币的国家也会因为担心美元的动荡引起自身的损失，目前考虑到另一种���代的储备货币。	And, apart from possible political considerations, large holders of dollars would find a substitution account attractive as a form of protection against strong fluctuations in the dollar’s value.
艾滋病的传染将戛然而止，正如大都市地区麻疹在儿童中的传染情况在80%的儿童获得免疫时就会结束，即使另外20%儿童没有接种。	The ongoing epidemic would grind to a halt, just as a measles epidemic among children in a metropolitan area ends when 80% percent of the children are vaccinated, even if the other 20% percent of children remain unvaccinated.
也许是衰落的标志，我们现在也有了黑色星期五，这是美国的舶来品，我们被鼓动本着现代圣诞精神大肆欢饮 ， “ 买买买”直到手软。	And just in case there was any sign of flagging, we now have Black Friday, an export from the United States, when we are all encouraged to drink deep of the modern Christmas spirit and shop until we drop.
明年，当跨政府气候变化委员会（Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change）开始发布其最新的科学证据评估报告时，气候变化失控的迹象必定会在文明社会掀起波澜。	And next year, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change begins publishing its latest assessment of the scientific evidence, the prospect of runaway climate change is bound to mobilize civil society.
在发达国家，资产价值的下跌以及随之而来的普遍的恐惧心理沉重地打击了消费者和企业的信心，这导致消费持续下降以及公司削减投资。	In the advanced countries, the fall in asset values and, more generally, fear of what comes next has shattered consumer and business confidence. Consumption is dropping, and companies are cutting investment.
这虽然能在一段时期内刺激增长，但当泡沫破灭，金融体系的巨额债务立马将经济拖入通缩和停滞的漩涡，而且日本到现在还没有完全脱身。	That may have spurred growth for a while, but when the bubbles burst, the financial system’s huge debts helped push the economy into a bout of deflation and stagnation from which it has still not fully emerged.

事实上，就在曼德拉走过罗本岛监狱大门，宣告非洲自由斗争胜利20年后的今天，科特迪瓦和津巴布韦等国的“强人”却继续罔顾人民的意愿，紧抱着权力不放。	Indeed, more than two decades after Mandela walked through the prison gates, supposedly completing Africa’s struggle for freedom, “Big Men” in countries like Congo and Zimbabwe continue to cling to power against the will of their people.
萨默斯和德隆还计算出设备投资的社会回报远大于私人回报，并因此得出了“一个强有力的论据似乎存在以证明经济政策不会惩罚 — — 而实际上是回报 — — 那些设备投资者 ” 。	Summers and DeLong also calculate that the social returns from equipment investment are far larger than private returns.
但中国领导人从未划定过“九条虚线”的确切位置，也没有明确过他们的要求是仅仅针对某些地貌，还是更为宽泛的海洋和大陆架。	But China’s leaders have never been clear about the exact location of the “nine-dotted line,” or about whether their claims refer only to certain land features, or also to more extensive continental shelves and seas.
其中一些预测者要比另外一些更为悲观（相比之下英国预算责任办公室算是尤其乐观的 ） ， 但似乎没有人能悲观到足够接近真相的程度。	Some forecasters are more pessimistic than others (the OBR has a particularly sunny disposition), but no one, it seems, has been pessimistic enough.

我们预测工资将承受下行压力，并通过抑制国内需求导致更低的就业和更高的不平等性（所有国家组别都是如此 ） 。	We projected downward wage pressure, which, by depressing domestic demand, would lead to lower employment and higher inequality in all country groupings.
与此同时，大规模的腐败彻底破坏了埃及的经济，近两年来的经济增长减少将近一半以上，随之而来的还有失业率上升、通货膨胀增大和货币贬值。	Meanwhile, massive corruption is devastating Egypt’s economy, with growth falling by half in the last two years, accompanied by rising unemployment, higher inflation, and currency depreciation.
阿根廷采取了极富创新精神的措施，用老债务换新债务 — — 大概是三折多一点的折算比例 — — 加上GDP指数债券。	In a highly innovative move, Argentina exchanged old debt for new debt – at about 30 cents on the dollar or a little more – plus a GDP-indexed bond.
许多欧盟领导人在与中国的“战略性合作”方式中看到了这种尊种，而这一新合作方式将有助于抑制超级大国美国的权利。	Many EU leaders see newfound respect coming in the form of a “strategic partnership” with China that is designed to balance the power of the United States.

Cohen have outlined, the US should act now to revive its pragmatic industrial-policy tradition, put finance back to work for the real economy, and invest in new activities that can reinvigorate a struggling middle class.
在希腊问题上，这些经济学家认为，财政政策转向“紧缩 ” — —即缩小公共部门 — — 导致了需求急剧萎缩，从而发生萧条。	Looking at Greece, these economists argue that a shift in fiscal policy to “austerity” – a smaller public sector – has brought an acute deficiency of demand and thus a depression.
相反，近年来这些赞助人的位置正逐渐被一批背景可疑的新富人所取代，这些人往往从事的是高利贷或者其他不正当行业。	Instead, these respectable supporters have gradually been replaced over the years by a shady new class of rich Japanese, who have risen through loan-sharking and other dubious businesses.
当前的僵持始于6月中旬，当时，印度的紧密盟友不丹发现解放军正在扩建一条通过洞朗的公路。 洞朗是喜马拉雅山区的一片高原，属于不丹领土，但中国对其有领土主张。	The current standoff began in mid-June, when Bhutan, a close ally of India, discovered the People’s Liberation Army trying to extend a road through Doklam, a high-altitude plateau in the Himalayas that belongs to Bhutan, but is claimed by China.

他相信，他在做正确的事，等待叙利亚冲突自己水落石出，同时将美国人民生民安全威胁最小化，这才是审慎的战略。	He believes that he is doing the right thing and following the prudent course in waiting for the Syrian conflict to burn itself out in some way while minimizing the long-term risk to American lives.
世界银行的新教育战略 — — “有教无类 — — 为促进发展投资人类知识和技能 ” （ Learning for All – Investing in People’s Knowledge and Skills to Promote Development ） — —便以此为目标。	The World Bank’s new education strategy, “Learning for All – Investing in People’s Knowledge and Skills to Promote Development,” highlights this imperative.

这就是为什么必须以税收替补的形式实施能源税，而所得税和工资税同时降低来让实际转移给政府的资源保持相同的水平。	That is why the energy tax must be imposed as a tax substitution, with income or payroll taxes simultaneously reduced to keep real resource transfers to government at a constant level.

美国是在19世纪进入后三分之一阶段随着全球化刚刚开始崛起的世界大国，这与美国西部开放的时间恰好是一致的。	America was just beginning to emerge as a world power during the surge of globalization in the last third of the nineteenth century, which coincided with the opening up of the American West.
如何能既鼓励那些革命性的主宰整个市场的创新，又能限制对市场支配力的滥用，这个问题在数字时代之前早就已经存在了。	The question of how to encourage transformational, market-dominating innovations while limiting the abuse of market power long precedes the digital age.
这不足为奇，全世界有超过5.7亿农民和七十亿消费者，但从田间到店头，全球工业农业的价值链控制在一小撮公司手中。	This is not surprising. Although there are more than 570 million farmers and seven billion consumers worldwide, just a handful of companies control the global industrial-agriculture value chain – from field to shop counter.
联合国儿童基金会巴基斯坦消灭脊髓灰质炎计划主管艾丹·奥利里（Aidan O’Leary）指出 ， “ 女接种员推动了每一项任务的进展 。 ”	As Aidan O’Leary, UNICEF’s chief of anti-polio efforts in Pakistan, has noted, “female vaccinators are driving every single operational gain that is being made.”
在去年12月的一次会议中，我询问SEC主席夏皮罗（Mary Schapiro ） ， 她的手下准备何时重新实施该规则。	At a conference last December, I asked SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro when her agency was planning to reintroduce the rule.
事实上，与其说是燃油税本身还不如说是其背后所代表的因素引发了这次黄背心抗议运动：那就是政府对生活在法国规模最大的城市中心以外的中产阶级的困境漠不关心。	In reality, the eruption of the Yellow Vest protests was less about the fuel tax than what its introduction represented: the government’s indifference to the plight of the middle class outside France’s largest urban centers.
2016年的潘多拉魔盒所释放出来的魔鬼 — — 回荡在关于特朗普支持者对美国有色人种的法西斯主义辱骂的广为流传的报道中 — — 将在美国的自我认知中自由游动，同时毒害其他所有人的认知。	And the demons released from Pandora’s box in 2016 – echoing in widespread reports of racist taunts by Trump supporters of non-whites in America – will continue to roam free in the country’s self-perception, and taint everyone else’s perception, too.
这意味着要在美国这类民族和种族多元化社会维持强大的社会福利国家的挑战并不现实，但可以促进相互尊重和包容。	However, this means that the challenge of maintaining a strong social welfare state in ethnically and racially diverse societies such as the US is not economic, but one of promoting respect and inclusiveness.
那一刻标志着多年来的战争以及难以言说的苦难终于终结，而革命在经历了流血与牺牲，英雄主义与敌人的错误以及斯大林这个所谓朋友的操纵与干预之后，终于获得了胜利。	That moment marked the end of years of war and terrible hardship; the revolution had been won through blood, sacrifice, heroism, the mistakes of enemies, and the manipulative assistance of Stalin, who purported to be a friend.
比如波兰前总统列赫·瓦文萨(Lech Walesa)最近就前往突尼斯，为一个旨在协助该国建立完善宪政改革和选举法的波兰项目提供顾问意见。	For example, former President Lech Wałesa recently visited Tunisia to offer advice as part of a Polish program to help Tunisia devise robust constitutional reforms and election laws.
但是，更确切地说，学者们所言是 自由 民主政体之间几乎从不开战，这很可能是因为自由主义宪政文化比仅仅选举的事实更重要。	But, more carefully stated, what scholars show is that liberal democracies almost never go to war with each other, and it may be that a liberal constitutional culture is more important than the mere fact of elections.
其实《里斯本条约》的通过已经为欧洲政治的组成元素增添了兼具长远眼光的现实主义理念，而欧盟未来的扩张至此已不再存在任何制度上的障碍。	The ratification of the Lisbon Treaty allows for an element of visionary realism in European politics, as there are no longer any institutional obstacles to the future enlargement of the EU.
印度与伊朗的密切关系建立在长期文化、社会、政治和经济关系的基础之上，目前印度正在出资进行伊朗港口查赫巴尔的修缮工作，以期通过该港口打通阿富汗的直达通道。	India has a strong relationship with Iran, underpinned by long-standing cultural, social, political, and economic ties, with India now funding an overhaul of the Iranian port of Chabahar, which will give it direct access to Afghanistan.
普京一直是“强力集团 ” （ siloviki，前苏联军事和情报官员）的拥趸，他们占据了普京内阁的大部分职位，负责克里姆林宫主宰俄罗斯政治生活的权力。	Putin has always been a great fan of the siloviki – former Soviet military and intelligence officers – who make up the bulk of his cabinet and account for the Kremlin’s unchecked power over Russian political life.
在1993年，在挪威的秘密双边谈判中（美国不知情 ） ， 以色列和巴勒斯坦解放组织就相互承认和建立临时巴勒斯坦自治政府达成协议。	In 1993, in secret bilateral negotiations in Norway (unknown to the Americans), Israel and the PLO reached an agreement about mutual recognition and the creation of a provisional Palestinian Autonomous Authority.
去年，英国、欧盟其他国家以及全世界大大小小的公司举行了数不清的会议和高规格规划研讨会为英国脱欧投票做好准备。	In the past year, companies big and small in the UK, elsewhere in the EU, and around the world have held countless meetings and high-level planning sessions to prepare for a Brexit vote.
如果美联储采取任何贷款-价值比上限政策，还将激起美国人对集中金融权力的担忧 — — 这一担忧自危机以来便有所增强。	Any attempt by the Fed to impose caps on loan-to-value ratios would also excite Americans’ fears of concentrated financial power – fears that have intensified since the crisis.
在今年3月，已经批准财政协议的欧洲理事会将注意力转向了重振经济增长方面，而这也是实现长期财政稳定的关键。	In March, having agreed on the fiscal treaty, the European Council turned its attention to reviving economic growth, which will be the key to long-term fiscal sustainability.
另一个同样重要的挑战则是北约与俄罗斯之间的合作，双方于今年11月的北约里斯本峰会上同意在导弹防御系统上展开合作。	Another, equally important challenge is cooperation between NATO and Russia, which agreed at NATO’s Lisbon summit in November to collaborate on the Alliance’s anti-missile defenses.
巴黎 - - 拯救金融体系是经济史上的一个怪异时刻，因为它的最大受益者是那些从市场的非理性繁荣中获得最多利益的人 - - 金融公司的大佬们。	PARIS – The bailout of the financial system was a bizarre moment in economic history, for it benefited those who benefited most from the markets’ irrational exuberance – the bosses of financial firms.
这还不算，巴西的巨型国家石油企业巴西石油公司（Petrobrás）已经着手实施沿里约热内卢海岸线发现的两块巨型深水油田的开发工作。	And, as if this good news were not enough, Brazil’s giant state oil company, Petrobrás, is already at work developing two huge deep-water oil fields discovered in the sea off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.
以人权的名义，现在是时候揭开战后人员失踪真相，以及为什么在10年时间里，联合国官员不理睬受害者家属提出的申诉，没有进行任何刑事调查。	And in the name of human rights, it is time for the truth to come out about the people who went missing after the conflict, and about why, for a decade, UN officials ignored appeals by the victims’ families and launched no criminal investigation.
美国在过去五十年里无论有多少缺陷，但毕竟还是一个良性的强国。 尽管我们重视中国和印度等新强国的兴起，但是，这些国家是否会像美国那样还有待观察。	As much as we all value the rise of new powers like China and India, it remains to be seen whether these countries will become as benevolent a power as America, however flawed, has been over the past half-century.
然而在长期看来，投资新兴市场经济体，尤其是那些宏观经济基础良好，政治环境稳定且中产阶级不断壮大的国家，是前景良好的。	Over the long term, however, the outlook for investing in emerging-market economies, particularly those with strong macroeconomic fundamentals, stable political environments, and an expanding middle class, is promising.
德国的抵制导致欧洲央行迟迟不能干预债券市场；最后欧洲央行终于启动了其债券购买计划，但也是在德国的默许下。	And German resistance contributed to a delay in the ECB’s intervention in bond markets; when the ECB finally did launch its bond-buying program, it did so with Germany’s tacit approval.
这些作家们认为，民主的生活方式趋向于摧毁原创性思维并且压制文化中的阳春白雪，造成平庸，从而使得公民受到民主的敌人们的蛊惑。	The democratic way of life, these writers argue, tends to destroy original thought and to suppress “high” culture, yielding a mediocrity that leaves citizens vulnerable to democracy’s enemies.
但是，在高能效的瑞士，创造每一千美元的能源使用量仅为100公斤，丹麦为110公斤，相比之下美国的能源使用量高达190公斤。	But, in energy-efficient Switzerland, energy use is just 100 kg per $1,000 of GDP, and in Demark it is just 110 kg, compared with 190 kg in the US.
平心而论，美国质疑中国希望构建的新秩序是否能与美国所领导的秩序一样公开并以规则为基础 — — 从而让中国获得实现其壮观经济崛起所需要的市场 — — 这是正确的。	To be sure, the US is right to wonder whether the new order that China hopes to build will be as open and rules-based as the American-led order – the one that gave China the market access it needed to achieve its spectacular economic rise.
1980年春，我还是德克萨斯州 油田上的一名年轻工人，我目睹美国基准原油价格上涨到每桶45美元 — — 相当于今天的138美元。	As a young man working in the Texas oil patch in the spring of 1980, I watched prices for the US benchmark crude rise as high as $45 a barrel – $138 in today’s dollars.
布雷顿森林机构（世界银行和国际货币基金组织 ） 、 马歇尔计划、欧洲经济共同体等项目支持了世界经济重要部分的复兴。	Initiatives like the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund), the Marshall Plan, and the European Economic Community supported the reconstruction of significant portions of the world economy.
但是那对于海豹、阿黛利企鹅、座头鲸、蓝鲸以及其他许多物种来说却是一个坏消息，因为绝大部分南极海洋生态系统的生物体依靠吃磷虾或者其他吃磷虾的东西为生。	But that’s bad news for leopard seals and Adelie penguins, humpback and blue whales, and many other species, because most organisms in the Antarctic marine ecosystem eat either krill or something that eats krill.
因为新闻投诉委员会“没有能力处理系统性非法侵犯隐私权的行为 ” ， 议会联合委员会提出建议改革监管机构。	Because the PCC “was not equipped to deal with systemic and illegal invasions of privacy,” the committee set out proposals for a reformed regulator.
通过积极参政、在理性自利的基础上进行投票以及培养抵制独裁所需的节制感，中产阶级极大地推动了民主进程。	By participating actively in politics, basing their electoral choices on rational self-interest, and developing the sense of moderation needed to resist dictatorship, the middle class promotes democratic progress.
最后，偿债能力比率应该有所补充 — — 通过让银行承担发行大量无抵押可转换债务（100%由其自有资本做支持）的义务来实现。	Finally, solvency rules should be complemented by an obligation that banks issue a substantial amount of non-collateralized debt – on the order of 100% of their capital – that is convertible into equity.
波恩—去年12月在巴黎，世界领导人齐聚一堂，就一系列全球经济去碳化和提升我们适应气候变化的能力的目标和路径形成了一致。	BONN – Last December in Paris, world leaders came together to agree on a set of goals and pathways for decarbonizing the global economy and increasing our capacity to adapt to climate change.
例如，在目前由参与计划的专家承包机构负责管理的免费公立学校，计划实施的第一年学习成绩就有了60%的提升。	For example, at the free public schools currently managed by expert contractors participating in the program, learning outcomes improved by 60% in the first year.
此外，过去十年中国建设了许多必须的硬件基础设施（也许有些领域有过量之嫌 ） ， 现在中国政府开始强调建软件基础设施，包括为促进市场发展的法律、会计、金融、及互联网等服务行业。	Moreover, having built the needed physical infrastructure in the last decade (perhaps to excess), China is now emphasizing the software infrastructure needed to sustain the growth of its burgeoning services sector.
简而言之，他们处在一个大部分国际债务 — — 以及更大份额的全球贸易 — — 仍然是以硬通货币计价的世界里。	Simply put, they live in a world where a large fraction of international debt – and an even larger share of global trade – is still denominated in hard currency.
事实上，他是我见到过最具魅力的迷人领袖；另外两位 — — 前联合国秘书长科菲·安南和前美国国务卿柯林·鲍威尔 — — 不是非洲人就是非洲裔美国人。	In fact, he is among the most charismatic and charming leaders I have met; the other two – former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former US Secretary of State Colin Powell – also are either African or African-American.
近日，国防部长阿什顿·卡特敦促美国网络司令部 — — 即致力于网络空间作战的军事部门 — — 加强反对伊斯兰国的战斗。	Recently, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter urged US Cyber Command – the arm of the military dedicated to cyberspace operations – to “intensify the fight” against ISIS.
去年十一月被亚努科维奇拒绝的联合协定 — — 当时这一决定曾引发导致其政府垮台的民众抗议 — — 自2007年来就一直处在谈判的过程当中。	The Association Agreement that Yanukovych rejected last November – a decision that incited the popular protests that brought down his government – had been under negotiation since 2007.
坎布里奇 — — 上个月，联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯呼吁采取全球行动，尽可能减少电子战对平民所造成的危害。	CAMBRIDGE – Last month, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for global action to minimize the risk posed by electronic warfare to civilians.
以畜牧生产为例，肉、蛋、奶等很多食物来源于畜牧生产 — — 它丰富了发展中国家食物的品种，同时有数百万人以此谋生。	Consider livestock production, which accounts for many foods – including milk, eggs, and meat – that have enriched diets in developing countries and provide livelihoods for millions.
在其他北欧债权国的支持下，德国无情地强制实行其财政原则，尽管这样做的系统性后果是造成压力（比如，希腊和西班牙的政府都已经改变 ） 。	Supported by other northern European creditors, Germany enforced its fiscal principles relentlessly, despite the systemic consequences for those it was pressuring (Greece and Spain, for example, now have different governments).
2013年的首要问题是穆尔西能否再续加沙辉煌，解决另一个重大的外交难题：结束超过30年的相互敌视并重塑与伊朗的关系。	The big question for 2013 is whether Morsi will follow his achievement in Gaza by tackling another major diplomatic challenge: rebuilding relations with Iran after more than three decades of animosity.
在经历过一年多的时间里天天发生的闹剧后，世界开始逐渐适应特朗普政府的执政现状，包括经常对外国领导人发起人身攻击和即便是与亲密盟友的关系都变幻莫测。	After over a year of near-daily drama, the world has begun to adjust to the reality of the Trump administration, which includes frequent ad hominem attacks on foreign leaders and capriciousness in relations even with close allies.
它不会将扣减和豁免数字限制在AGI的2 % ， 只是将由此产生的个人利用这些特别条款获得的税收减免额 — — 也就是税收福利 — — 限制在这一范围内。	It would not limit the amount of deductions and exclusions to 2% of AGI, but rather would limit the resulting tax reduction – that is, the tax benefit – that the individual gets by using all these special features.
在这样的压力下，医学科学家们容易产生幻想，认为他们的研究工具和过程在一定程度上将他们从自身的精神和身体局限中解脱出来。	Under this strain, medical research scientists are susceptible to the dream that their instruments and procedures have somehow freed them from the limitations of their minds and bodies.
全球权力分配所引发的结构性反美运动在伊拉克战争爆发前就非常明显，这与克林顿在任时由美国领导的全球化形成了鲜明的对照。	The structural anti-Americanism arising from the global distribution of power was evident well before the Iraq war, in the opposition to American-led globalization during the Clinton years.
我自己则发现只要对谷歌翻译做一些修改，就能得到不错的结果，因此剩下了不少翻译成本，不过这对我请来做翻译的研究生来说意味着收入损失。	I myself have saved on translation costs since realizing that, with some edits by me, Google Translate can work just fine, though this means lost income for the graduate students whom I used to hire the task.
于是敏突出强调沃尔特斯支持特朗普“废除和取代”廉价医保法案（即“奥巴马医保法案 ” ） 的企图，还强调她对特朗普更大范围预算缩减计划的支持。	So Min has highlighted Walters’ support for Trump’s attempt to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”), as well as her backing for his broader budget-cutting agenda.
此外，尽管杀虫剂和其他污染物被认为会杀死一半人类，良好的杀虫剂管制让每年美国死亡人数只有20例，同时，杀虫剂的使用创造了更廉价、更充足的粮食供给。	And, while pesticides and other pollutants were seen to kill off perhaps half of humanity, well-regulated pesticides cause about 20 deaths each year in the US, whereas they have significant upsides in creating cheaper and more plentiful food.
希腊现已驱逐两名俄罗斯外交官，致使俄罗斯取消外交部长谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫访问雅典的行程，并宣布将希腊外交官逐出莫斯科。	Greece has now expelled two Russian diplomats, leading Russia to cancel an upcoming visit to Athens by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and to announce the expulsion of Greek diplomats from Moscow.
中国当然不希望看到一个拥有核武器或四处叫战的朝鲜，但它更害怕的是一个令无数难民争相涌入己方边境的失败国家。	China does not want a nuclear or belligerent North Korea, but it is even more concerned about a failed state collapsing on its border.
比如，我们在课程之处的调查表明，只有21%的人自称“几乎每次都会”交叉验证自己所接触到的新闻，在一个媒体信任度低但新闻消费率高的的国家，这一比例令人担忧。	For example, when we surveyed people at the beginning of the course, only 21% said that they “almost always” crosschecked the news they consume, a troubling rate for a country where trust in media is low but consumption is high.
综合起来考虑，很容易设想得到GDP增长走向在未来十年 — — 可能不止十年 — — 比正常水平低1 % 。	Taken together, these factors make it easy to imagine trend GDP growth being one percentage point below normal for another decade, possibly even longer.
公共支出改革的政治经济学很复杂，精心设计的宏观经济计划可能被分赃政治（pork-barrel politics）绑架。	The political economy of public-spending reform is tricky, and well-designed macroeconomic plans can be taken hostage by pork-barrel politics.
随后巴基斯坦建立了议会民主制，由富有魅力的总理扎比卡尔·阿里·布托（Zulfikar Ali Bhutto）所领导。	Afterwards, Pakistan was governed as a parliamentary democracy, led by the charismatic Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
无论如何，民族主义政客都有一个巨大的优势，他们必须要务实的计划：所有好东西都会随着主权的到来而到来。	Either way, nationalist politicians enjoy the huge advantage of not requiring a practical program: all good things will flow from sovereignty.
当然，如果外汇储备继续以每年5,000亿美元（2015年的数字）的速度消耗，这一缓冲将在六年后耗尽。	Of course, this cushion would effectively vanish in six years if foreign reserves were to continue falling at the same $500 billion annual rate recorded in 2015.
然后还有英国政治领导层的问题，对于他们来说扩大是一种阻止机构深化改革，以及实际上化解将欧洲政治化的一个途径。	Then there is Britain’s political leadership, for whom enlargement is a way to avoid deepening, and, indeed, to dissolve political Europe.
而其成本是每年1万亿美元或以上 — — 这是一个昂贵得令人咋舌的方法，而不会在本世纪末之前造成潜在洪水和干旱发生率的有意义的变化。	And it would cost $1 trillion a year or more – an incredibly expensive way to make no meaningful difference to a potential increase in flooding and droughts at the end of the century.
收入增长加速，财富主要靠挣（不管公不公平 ） ， 政治由中产阶级主宰，经济不平等也相当温和（即使种族和性别平等仍然大大落后 ） 。	Income growth accelerated, wealth was predominantly earned (justly or unjustly), politics became dominated by the middle class, and economic inequality was modest (even if race and gender equality remained a long way off).
作为回报，土耳其将帮助KRG建设输油管道基础工程，出口土耳其的油气将不必依赖伊拉克国有管道，后者控制在巴格达中央政府手中。	In return, Turkey is to help the KRG build pipeline infrastructure that will allow oil and gas to be exported to Turkey without relying on Iraq’s national pipeline, which is controlled by the central government in Baghdad.
20世纪七八十年代，林德贝克干预瑞典选举，援引微观经济学理论对抗社会民主，并警告说高税收和充分就业导致灾难。	During the 1970s and 1980s, Lindbeck intervened in Swedish elections, invoked microeconomic theory against social democracy, and warned that high taxation and full employment led to disaster.
在特朗普的种族民族主义圈子里影响甚巨的弗兰克·戈夫尼（Frank Gaffney）说穆斯林是“白蚁 ” ， 他们“掏空公民社会和其他制度的骨架 。 ”	Frank Gaffney, an influential figure in Trump’s ethnic nationalist circles, spoke of Muslims as “termites,” who “hollow out the structure of the civil society and other institutions.”
主要专注于和平和安全问题的NGO要少得多（大概只有几百家 ） ， 不过一些主要专注于人权的组织，比如人权观察组织（Human Rights Watch）和国际特赦组织（Amnesty International）在这方面也很活跃。	A much smaller number – a few hundred at best – work primarily on peace and security issues, though some primarily human rights-focused organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are influential here.
当时，人们重视欧洲一体化，因为它不仅不会带来任何事实上的主权损失；反而能够提供巨大的社会经济优势，从而允许其成员国最大限度地发挥国际影响力。	At the time, European integration was valued because it did not entail any de facto loss of sovereignty; on the contrary, the EU offered great socioeconomic advantages, enabling its members to maximize their international influence.
是的，在过去十年里，人们越来越多地使用全球治理标准 — — 这些标准主要是在美国发展起来的 — — 来评估世界各国和公司是怎样保护小投资者利益的。	Yes, over the last decade, there has been growing use of global governance standards, largely developed in the United States, to assess how countries and companies around the world protect minority investors.
这个观点的另一个含义就是中国储蓄的急剧上升在很大程度上是由中年中国人储蓄率的上升（而不是年轻人贷款率下降）所导致的。	Another implication of this view is that the steep rise in savings in China is largely driven by a rise in the savings rate of middle-aged Chinese (rather than a fall in the borrowing rate of the young).
美国的其他长期优势 — — 灵活性、再生能力、经济流动性、国际监管优势以及世界主要储备货币 — — 将继续保持。	And the country’s other longstanding advantages – flexibility, capacity for renewal, economic mobility, international regulatory strength, and the world’s main reserve currency – remain in place.
即便是双方最温和的领导人都无法就冲突的一连串核心问题达成和解：边界、定居点、耶路撒冷，还有1947~1948年间的巴勒斯坦难民以及后裔的安置问题。	Even the most moderate leaders on both sides could not agree on the core issues of the conflict: borders, settlements, Jerusalem, and the fate of 1947-1948 Palestinian refugees and their descendants.
而且要是仔细看看中国人对西藏骚乱和四川地震是如何反应的话，就可以发现切实迹象，也就是中国人正在接受更大程度的言论自由。	And when one looks more closely at how Chinese responded, both to the unrest in Tibet and the Sichuan earthquake, one sees tangible signs that the Chinese are embracing a greater degree of free speech.
巴塞罗纳－金融危机、信贷紧缩以及随之而来的经济下滑，已经严重损害了金融市场、金融机构以及交易商的信誉。	Barcelona – The financial crisis, credit crunch, and ensuing economic downturn have severely damaged the credibility of financial markets, institutions, and traders.
处理那些“大而不倒”企业/政府的问题当然重要，但相对于经济危机所造成的损失来说，为纳税人为救助银行而支付的直接成本其实不那么重要。	Fixing the “too big to fail” problem is certainly important, but the direct taxpayer costs of bank rescues were small change compared to the damage wreaked by the financial crisis.
在这方面，NPT要求所有签署方“在谈判时要真心实意地相信要在核武器竞赛的萌芽期就采取有效措施予以扼杀，也要采取有效措施核裁军化 。 ”	To this end, the treaty committed all signatories to “undertake negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.”
该管道由俄罗斯－德国－荷兰三国合资联营，但其中能源巨头俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司却独占51％的股份并因此牢牢掌握着主导权。	The pipeline has been established as a Russian-German-Dutch consortium, but it is the Russian energy giant Gazprom that is in the driver’s seat with 51% of the shares.
国际货币基金组织和七国集团国家的中央银行必须担当起作为最后手段的全球借款者的角色并提供大量的流动资金，迅速地并且不附加太多条件地支持新兴市场的货币。	The International Monetary Fund and the G7 countries’ central banks must act as global lenders of last resort and provide ample liquidity – quickly and with few strings attached – to support emerging markets’ currencies.
放眼未来，污垢动力燃料电池能够点亮边远村庄，让孩子们能够学习，而大型水源淡化工厂能够从海洋生产饮用水。	Looking forward, dirt-powered fuel cells could light remote villages so children can study, and large-scale water desalination plants may generate drinking water from the ocean.
今年早些时候，美国环境保护署（EPA）得出结论 ： “ 基于现有数据的证据采纳权重，2,4-D应被划为‘不太可能对人类产生致癌效果 ’ 。 ”	Earlier this year, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concluded that “based on weight of evidence consideration of the available data, 2,4-D would be classified as ‘Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans.’”
然而实际上，陈在进一步融入全球经济面前畏缩不前，拒绝对外国投资者开放台湾所有的经济领域，这本可以增强台湾的竞争力和效率。	Instead, Chen balked at further integration into the global economy, refusing to open all of Taiwan’s economic sectors to foreign participation, which would have strengthened Taiwan’s competitiveness and efficiency.
现在和当时一样，非洲政府、医疗服务提供商、制药企业和非政府组织之间的合作决定了抗击癌症能否取得成功。	Now, as then, success depends on coordination among African governments, health-service providers, drug makers, and non-governmental organizations.
德国新政府宣誓的那一天以来，很显然默克尔的招牌式策略 — — 通过将潜在批评者纳入内阁来消除批评已不再管用。	Since the day the new German government was sworn in, it has been clear that Merkel’s trademark tactic of neutralizing potential critics by including them in her cabinet would no longer work.
关键洞见是，当现有企业受到保护，怀揣新概念的新来者无法进入市场时，结果将是 — — 用哈耶克（Friedrich Hayek）的话说 — — 创新和对变化的世界的“适应”的损失。	The key insight is that when existing enterprises are protected from new market entrants bearing new ideas, the result will be less innovation and less “adaptation” to a changing world, to use Friedrich Hayek’sterm.
但要想确保高投票率，只有一个现实的选择：反腐运动领导者、大声批评克里姆林宫的阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexei Navalny ） 。	But there is only one real option to secure a large voter turnout: the anti-corruption campaigner and vocal Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
归根结底，朔伊布勒也明白自己提出的条件并不为政界所接受。 因此，朔伊布勒提出，无法满足其条件的国家 “ 在确保欧盟成员国资格的前提下，最终都应退出货币同盟 。 ”	After all, Schauble knows that the conditions he proposes would be politically unacceptable, so he says that any country unable to meet them “should, as a last resort, exit the monetary union, while being able to remain a member of the EU.”
如果我冒险猜测一下，我会说，作为一个社会，我们从信息时代技术中获得的好处被我们生活在前所未有地不平等的世界中所带来的嫉妒和怨气所中和了。	If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that, as a society, the benefits we have received from information-age technology have been neutralized by the envy and spite that results from living in a world that is ever more unequal.
保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker）在1980年代早期带领美联储应对猛烈通胀压力时就知道这一点。	Paul Volcker knew that when he led the charge against raging inflation in the early 1980s.
沙特同样也渴望遏制伊朗的威胁以及不断增长的“什叶派新月 ” 。 这一“什叶派新月”由于什叶派在伊拉克坐大已经向西转移，包括沙特王国的什叶派地区。	Saudi Arabia is just as eager to contain the Iranian threat and the growing “Shi’a crescent” that, with the empowerment of the Shi’a in Iraq, has moved westward to begin to include the Shi’a regions of the Kingdom.
这就是最近的世界经济论坛（WEF）阿布扎比会议所提出的问题。 这次会议集中讨论了信息革命所带来的三种潜在情景中的未来治理。	That is what the World Economic Forum (WEF) asked at a recent meeting in Abu Dhabi that focused on the future of governance under three potential scenarios arising from the ongoing information revolution.
只要看看Omar Barghouti、Ali Abunimah和其他运动发起人的声明，就知道他们恰恰最不希望订立两国协议。	One has only to read the declarations of Omar Barghouti, Ali Abunimah, and other promoters of the BDS movement to see that this solution is precisely what they do not want.
不幸的是，如果完全由委内瑞拉人民自行处理，镇压和极端化就不可能结束，因为在过去15年中，委内瑞拉人从未找到过走出困境的办法。	Unfortunately, none of this seems likely if left exclusively in the hands of Venezuelans, who have failed repeatedly over the past 15 years to find solutions to their dilemmas.
1995年，我在五角大楼供职，当时中国刚开始建设美济礁。 美济礁是菲律宾宣布主权的岛礁，距离菲律宾海岸比中国海岸更近。	In 1995, when I was serving in the Pentagon, China began building structures on Mischief Reef, which is claimed by the Philippines and lies much closer to its shores than to China’s.
阿富汗的农民素来置强迫清除鸦片以及改换作物的激励于不顾而种植罂粟。 如此还会为他们提供一种受到法律调整的选择，而且最终会对海洛因交易产生影响。	It would also provide Afghan peasants, who have been growing poppy despite forced eradication of the plant and incentives to change crops, with an option that is regulated by law and that, in time, could have an impact on the heroin trade.
迎接气候变化的挑战需要将减排与为大部分人创造更美好的未来以及提供依靠体面的工作维生的机会融合起来的新的发展模式。	Meeting the challenge of climate change will require a new development model that combines reduced emissions with a better future for the vast majority of people and the opportunity to earn a living in a decent job.
毕竟，欧盟（包括由17个成员国组成的欧元区）仍只是国家的组合，各国在经济、金融和社会条件诸方面存在巨大差异。	After all, the European Union (including the eurozone’s 17 members) remains a collective of nation-states with notable divergences in economic, financial, and social conditions.
华盛顿—美国宪法的起草者做出了根本性的选择：他们应该将权力集中在一个人手里，还是设计一套政治制度，让决策影响力更加分散？	WASHINGTON, DC – The drafters of the United States Constitution had to make a fundamental choice: Should they concentrate power in the hands of one man, or devise a political system in which decision-making influence would be more diffuse?
欧洲一体化越深入，国家政府就越无力实施再分配，因为个人、公司和就业岗位必定会离开高税率国家，在法国等国家这一现象已经出现了。	The more deeply integrated Europe becomes, the less capacity national governments have for redistribution, because individuals, companies, and jobs can simply leave countries with higher tax rates, as has already happened in countries like France.
欧盟明确规定只要 “ [ 转基因生物]成分属无意进入产品且含量小于0.9 % ” ，食品就可以贴上有机标签。	EU rules are clear that food may be labeled as organic as long as “the ingredients containing [genetically modified organisms] entered the products unintentionally” and amount to less than 0.9% of their content.
在受到贸易战威胁的严峻国际形势下，中国应该致力于进一步提高已经取得成功的城市群的升级发展，特别是粤港澳大湾区。	China should also work to foster even faster growth in urban clusters that are already successful.
几乎同时在瓦伦西亚一年一度的火节庆典上，出现了装扮成邪恶女校长的默克尔将“灭绝女王安吉拉十诫”亲手交给西班牙政府首脑及各部部长。	In Valencia at around the same time, on the occasion of the annual Fallas celebration, there was Merkel as an evil headmistress delivering to the head of the Spanish government and his ministers “The Ten Commandments of Angela the Exterminator.”
它提供的不是可信的汇率升值压力抵抗力（这是它的初衷 ） ， 而是引发了彻底的反转，贬值预期开始在外汇市场上愈演愈烈。	Instead of providing credible resistance to upward pressure on the exchange rate, as intended, it triggered an outright reversal, with depreciation expectations beginning to creep into foreign-exchange markets.
事实与认识之间的不对等反映了双边联盟衰退的根本原因：双方都不充分领会持续结盟的必要性，也不了解为了确保安全所必须承担的政治成本。	This disparity between fact and perception reflects the root cause of the decay in the bilateral alliance: neither country fully appreciates the ongoing need for the alliance, or the political costs that it must bear for the sake of security.
移出名单的标准 — — 过去六个月中没有恐怖活动或与恐怖组织合作 — — 足够灵活，因此可以用来作为现成的外交谈判筹码。	The standard for de-designation – no acts of terrorism or cooperation with terrorist groups in the past six months – is flexible enough that removal from the list can readily be used as a diplomatic bargaining chip.
他们认为稳健复苏和就业创造会从天上掉下来；因此，欧洲非但没有迎来可持续增长，反而进入了一种新模式 — — “可持续停滞 ” 。	They assume that robust recovery and job creation will emerge simply of their own accord; as a result, rather than enjoying sustainable growth, Europe is heading toward a model for which a new term – “sustainable stagnation” – might be appropriate.
令人悲哀的是，世界很多地方的男男女女似乎并没有摆脱圣经中“以眼还眼”的训诫，他们渴望对犯罪行为施以惩罚。	Sadly, in many places in the world, it seems that men and women have not advanced beyond the biblical admonition of “an eye for an eye” in their yearning for retribution.
事实上，如果官方融资地位较低，那么它相当于在为私人债权人提供更大的损失缓冲垫，从而更多地拯救私人债权人。	Indeed, if official funding were junior, it would be providing a larger cushion to private creditors – and thus bailing them out to an even greater extent.
首先是遗漏错误（errors of omission ） — —共识中的盲点让经济学家难以看到未来的麻烦。	First, there are errors of omission – cases in which blind spots in the consensus prevent economists from being able to see troubles looming ahead.
世界银行计划于明年春天发布的个人银行账户最新统计数据预计将会表明越来越多的人开始持有银行或其他正式金融机构的账户。	The World Bank’s latest figures on individuals’ bank accounts, to be released next spring, are expected to show that the number of people holding accounts at banks or other formal financial institutions has grown.
20世纪60年代，华沙美中双边会谈一直没有取得进展，直到尼克松及其国务卿基辛格另辟蹊径，在巴基斯坦的协助下与中国开展了更加直接的交流。	The bilateral US-China talks in Warsaw in the 1960’s were fruitless until Richard M. Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger opened a different, more direct discussion through the auspices of Pakistan.
处理和储存信息的成本在最近几年大大下降了，因此，拥有规模优势的企业，运营成本会更低，而随着用户的倍增，利润也会迅速上升（谷歌和Facebook都是很好的例子 ） 。	Because the cost of processing and storing information has declined in recent years, a firm with a size advantage has smaller operating costs, and profits rise rapidly as the number of users multiplies (Google and Facebook are good examples).
除非投资者认为美联储会永远买入债券不停歇，否则美联储减少购买量的新闻应该只会对他们关于美联储的最周债券存量持有量的预期产生温和影响。	Unless investors thought the Fed was going to buy bonds forever, news about a reduction in Fed purchases should have had only a mild effect on their expectations of the eventual stock of bonds the Fed would hold.
三十多年来，中国TFP平均增长率为4 % ， 并且可能在未来十年有所下降，因此这一情景可能无法实现。	Given that China’s TFP growth has averaged 4% for more than 30 years, and is likely to slow in the coming decade, this scenario is improbable.
而且，通货膨胀在实行价格管制的情况下仍然超过200 % ， 因为央行货币化的财政赤字超过GDP的20 % 。	And, despite price controls, inflation is above 200%, because the central bank monetizes a fiscal deficit of more than 20% of GDP.
法律像经济一样，长期以来一直扮演着政治的替身，这当中体现出一种观点，那就是因为别无选择必须实行自由民主和自由市场，所以政治可以与技术统治相等同。	The law – like the economy – has served as a stand-in for politics for too long, embodying the idea that, with no alternative to liberal democracy and free markets, politics can be reduced to technocracy.
第二个改变更加不明显，但却更为重要：从2002年巴西总统路易斯 伊纳西奥 卢拉 达席尔瓦胜选后所带来的政治稳定。	The second change is both less obvious and more important: the political stability that came with the election in 2002 of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
逊尼派军事组织博科圣地（Boko Haram）因为在4月份 劫持276名女生并强迫她们嫁给其成员而在全世界臭名昭著。 该组织扰乱尼日利亚已有多年。	The Sunni militant group Boko Haram, known internationally for abducting 276 schoolgirls in April and forcing them to marry its members, has been wreaking havoc in Nigeria for years.
这场起义结束了一个腐败的政权，把权力 — — 在自由公正的选举之后 — — 交给了乌克兰有史以来最有改革思维的政府。	That uprising ended a corrupt regime and brought to power – after a free and fair election – what appears to be Ukraine’s most reform-minded government ever.
可能绝大部分的非洲人至少可以在紧急情况下能找到手机并使用手机 - 或是他们自己的手机，或是朋友的手机，或是商业性的电话服务处。	Probably a significant majority of Africans have at least emergency access to a cell phone, either their own, a neighbor’s, or one at a commercial kiosk.
事实上，尽管做出了就成立新开发银行展开“正式谈判”的承诺，但该银行的规模和出资份额等问题仍有待解决。	In fact, despite a commitment to launch “formal negotiations” to establish the bank, disagreements about the size and shares of the bank’s capital have not been resolved.
原因很简单：长期以来，美国人一直对“大政府”持狐疑态度，这演变为一种政治自恨（self-hatred ） ， 不管是决策者还是公民，都相信政府不管政，才是最好的。	The reason is simple: Americans’ longstanding suspicion of “big government” morphed into a kind of political self-hatred, with policymakers and citizens alike led to believe that government is at its best when it does not govern.
接下来的步骤更为具有挑衅性。 这包括修改标准工作合同以及要求邀请所有的工人在罢工八天以后都参加投票。	Even more provocative are the next steps: a plan to revamp the standard work contract and to require that all workers be invited to vote after eight days of a strike.
我不想给人留下消极的印象，但我不知道什么时候这样的日子才能结束 ， ” 在女儿玛丽亚·冈萨雷斯·萨格拉里奥·弗洛雷斯失踪并被杀十八年后的2016年7月3日，墨西哥华雷斯的保拉·弗洛雷斯如是说。	I don’t want to be negative, but I don’t know when this will stop,” said Paula Flores of Juárez, Mexico, on July 3, 2016, 18 years after the disappearance and murder of her daughter, María Sagrario González Flores.
美国疾病控制中心最近发布了一份报告，估算美国有40％的人肥胖（定义为身体质量指数BMI为30或更高 ） ， 其中包括20.6％的12~19岁青少年。	Recently, the US Centers for Disease Control estimated that a stunning 40% of all Americans are obese (defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher), a figure that includes 20.6% of adolescents (12-19 years old).
上述事件的时机非常尴尬，恰恰发生在荷兰国王威廉·亚历山大准备出访俄罗斯庆祝所谓“荷兰—俄罗斯年”两国友好关系之前。	The timing of all of this was awkward. The Dutch king, Willem Alexander, was about to visit Russia to celebrate the two countries’ friendly relations in the so-called “Netherlands-Russia Year.”
拜大宗商品价格下跌和美国量化宽松结束所赐，整个地区的经济增长都有所下降，但哥伦比亚的经济实际上还有所加速。	As growth slows throughout the region, owing to falling commodity prices and the end of quantitative easing in the United States, Colombia’s economy is actually accelerating.
非洲力量采取了“以交易为中心的方针 ” ， 建立团队理顺“东道国政府、私人部门和出资人”之间的激励。	Power Africa takes a “transaction-centered approach,” creating teams to align incentives among “host governments, the private sector, and donors.”
此外在构建一个切实可行的战略时，日本必须优先考虑深化与诸如印度、印尼和韩国等亚洲民主国家的盟友关系。	In constructing a viable strategy, deepening Japan’s partnerships with Asia’s great democracies – India, Indonesia, and South Korea – must be a priority.
曾被凯末尔世俗国家压制的风俗习惯（比方说妇女在公共场所佩戴头巾）重新出现是因为土耳其农村民众的影响力更大。	Customs that the Kemalist secular state suppressed, such as women’s use of headscarves in public places, have reappeared, because rural Turks have more influence.
考虑到由欧洲主权债务和银行危机所引发的全球威胁，巩固欧洲银行系统和鼓励财政整合的措施在最近墨西哥洛斯卡沃斯（Los Cabos）举行的G20峰会上得到了推进。	Given the global menace posed by Europe’s sovereign-debt and banking crises, measures to strengthen the European banking system and encourage fiscal integration gained some momentum at the recent G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico.
他的敌人不仅仅是穆斯林，还有西方那些自由派精英及其子女，这些人都在利用“文化多元主义”和“文化马克思主义”来毁灭欧洲。	His enemies are not just Muslims, but the liberal Western elites, and their children, who were destroying Europe from within through “multiculturalism” and “cultural Marxism.”
但特朗普不太可能权衡将家庭成员塞进内部圈子的利弊，尤其因为其自身经历使然：自从他的父亲带他进入家族企业，他就从来没有在其他地方做过任何工作。	Yet Trump is unlikely to weigh the pros and cons of stacking his inner circle with family members, not least because of his own experience: ever since his father brought him into the family business, he has never worked anywhere else.
显然，近期趋势 — — 失业率的大幅下降以及相当漂亮并且还在加速的经济增长 — — 让克鲁格曼的宏观经济诊断令人质疑（但他的进步政治学除外 ） 。	Obviously, recent trends – a significant decline in the unemployment rate and a reasonably high and accelerating rate of economic growth – cast doubt on Krugman’s macroeconomic diagnosis (though not on his progressive politics).
互联网不仅将在未来数年中位中国创造经济动力；它还将有助于基于固定资产投资和廉价劳动力的不可持续的增长模式的转变。	The Internet will not only create economic momentum for China in the years ahead; it will help to transform an unsustainable growth model based on fixed investment and cheap labor.
澳大利亚前外长加雷斯·埃文斯已经认为逮捕令是“强有力的外交工具 ” ， 《华盛顿邮报》则表示可以把逮捕令当成“和巴希尔先生以及他的中国和阿拉伯盟友讨价还价的筹码”来使用。	Gareth Evans, a former Australian Foreign Minister, has called it “a powerful diplomatic tool,” while the Washington Post has called for the warrant to be used “as a bargaining chip with Mr. Bashir and his Chinese and Arab allies.”
据全球经济指标官方“仲裁官 ” — —国际货币基金组织（IMF ） ， 中国经济贡献世界GDP的17.3 % （ 以购买力平价衡量 ） 。	According to the International Monetary Fund – the official arbiter of global economic metrics – the Chinese economy accounts for 17.3% of world GDP (measured on a purchasing-power-parity basis).
就算世界实现巴黎气候协定将全球气温升高限制在比前工业化水平高2℃的目标，因为极端天气现在已经成为新常态，能否适应依然至关重要。	Even if the world meets the Paris climate agreement’s target of limiting the increase in global temperature to 2º Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels, adaptation will still be critical, because climate extremes are now the new normal.
对于科恩来说，一个积极的进展就是第二轮公民复决很有可能将会唤起人们记住爱尔兰加入欧盟以来在经济领域获得的好处。	One positive development for Cowen is that a second referendum would most likely bring back into play the significant economic dimension of Ireland’s EU membership.
但是，一些国家仍有提高某些商品的关税的空间，如果它们能开发可再生能源资源，加强保护措施，能源出口也可能增长。	Still, some countries may have room to raise tariffs on certain consumer goods. And if they develop renewable-energy sources and step up their conservation efforts, they can increase their energy exports.
在欧洲气候基金会对特定化学产品的试点研究中，来自麦肯锡的专家确认二氧化碳排放量存在进一步减少50-75%的潜力。	In a pilot study on specific chemical products for the European Climate Foundation, experts from McKinsey identified the potential for a further 50-75% reduction in CO2 emissions.
从尼日利亚到印度，社区在卡达斯塔基金会的帮助下，御用手持设备丈量土地，用硬证据支持土地权利主张，从而实现土地所有权的逐步强化。	Together with the Cadasta Foundation, communities from Nigeria to India are using hand-held devices to map property and support land claims with hard evidence, thereby allowing for incremental strengthening of tenure.
在最初两年，欧盟每年至少应该为寻求庇护者提供人均15,000欧元以帮助他们覆盖住房、医疗和教育成本 — — 也让成员国感到接受难民是一件有吸引力的事。	The EU should provide €15,000 ($16,800) per asylum-seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, health care, and education costs – and to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states.
事实上，朝鲜的大部分研发活动，包括对核裂变材料的浓缩活动，都是在外部调查者难以进入的秘密设施中进行的。	Indeed, most of North Korea’s R&D, not least its enrichment of fissile materials, occurs in secret facilities inaccessible to outside inspectors.
西方的那套冷战对抗和遏制政策必将遭到中国人的强烈反抗, 而中国的全球杠杆作用（尤其在金融方面）也已强大到无法被忽视。	A Cold War-style confrontation and containment policy from the West will be met with strong resistance from the Chinese, whose global leverage, particularly in finance, cannot be ignored.
时任美国财政部长的安德鲁·梅林（Andrew Mellen）曾主张将工人、农场主、证券和房地产债务清盘 ， “ 把脓水挤掉 ” 。	Andrew Mellon, the United States Treasury Secretary at the time, talked about liquidating workers, farmers, stocks, and real estate in order “to purge the rottenness out of the system.”
日内瓦—近三十年前，柏林墙倒塌，代表着国家从全球经济中撤退的最高潮，也标志着社会主义经济学在全世界的一败涂地。	GENEVA – The fall of the Berlin Wall almost 30 years ago represented a high-water mark in the retreat of the state from the global economy, signaling a defeat of socialist economics virtually worldwide.
对于高储蓄率的传统解释（缺乏社会安全网，有限的公共服务，人口老化，消费信贷的不发达）只是这一迷局的其中一部分。	Traditional explanations for the high savings rate (lack of a social safety net, limited public services, aging of the population, underdevelopment of consumer finance, etc.) are only part of the puzzle.
但那些对中国标志性GDP增长的肤浅成见依然存在，因此下降25%至年均7~8%的放缓被认为是预示着当代世界最伟大增长神话的终结。	Yet a superficial fixation on China’s headline GDP growth persists, so that a 25% deceleration, to a 7-8% annual rate, is perceived as somehow heralding the end of the modern world’s greatest development story.
一年前，欧洲领导人们就承认如果没有经济增长，希腊的状况便无法得到恢复，并且只是通过紧缩政策经济不会得到增长。	A year ago, European leaders acknowledged that Greece could not recover without growth, and that growth could not be achieved by austerity alone.
有见及此，中国领导人必须将金融部门改革和提高公共部门积极性相结合,以增加与高潜在回报部门资金的联系渠道。	Given this, China’s leaders must use a combination of financial-sector reforms and improved public-sector incentives to increase access to capital in sectors with high potential rates of return.
2010年，乔弗里·韦斯特（Geoffrey West）与一群研究者一起发现，不少社会经济指标 — — 既有积极指标，也有消极指标 — — 随地方人口的增加而增加。	In 2010, Geoffrey West, together with a team of researchers, discovered that several socioeconomic measures – both positive and negative – increase with the size of the local population.
而且事实上，尽管纳赛尔具有亲苏倾向，直到1967年与以色列的灾难性战争冻结埃美关系之前，埃及一直是美国对外援助的最大接受国。	And, in fact, despite Nasser’s pro-Soviet bent, Egypt was the largest recipient of American foreign aid until its disastrous war with Israel in 1967 froze relations.
十余年来，金融市场给了直到2014年仍担任总理的埃尔多安疑罪从无的信任，并以宽松的信贷条件助推土耳其经济。	For more than a decade, financial markets gave Erdoğan, who was Prime Minister until 2014, the benefit of the doubt and supplied the Turkish economy with easy credit.
一开始，俄罗斯的反应是冷淡，这主要是因为，考虑到以色列日益成为中东的一股能源力量，土以关系破冰妨碍了俄罗斯增加对土能源出口的计划。	At first, Russia’s reaction was lukewarm, largely because, given Israel’s role as a rising energy power in the Middle East, the reconciliation jeopardized Russia’s plans of boosting energy exports to Turkey.
国际货币基金组织长久以来一直都是左派与右派的替罪羊 — — 为前者替罪，是因为该组织将工作重点聚焦在财政廉洁与经济正统上；而为后者代罪，则是因为该组织的作用在于救援那些负债累累的国家。	The IMF has long been a whipping boy for both left and right – the former because of the Fund’s emphasis on fiscal rectitude and economic orthodoxy, and the latter because of its role in bailing out indebted nations.
登山者将在冰川逐渐融化的喜马拉雅山上拉起横幅标语，而在遭到气候变化威胁的澳大利亚大堡礁，潜水员们也将有所宣示。	There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas, where the glaciers are melting, and scuba divers at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which is threatened by climate change.
日本是世界上唯一一个受到如此限制的国家 — — 之所以如此，不但是要防止军国主义复燃，也是要惩罚日本战时政府的政策 — — 继续遵守这样的限制是不现实的。	Japan is the only country in the world bound by such restrictions – imposed not just to prevent a militarist revival, but also to punish Japan for its wartime government’s policies – and continued adherence to them is unrealistic.
反之，特朗普说他不会动社会安全，将废除奥巴马医保用新政策取而代之，并提高政府支出的效率和效果（尽管他并没有提出具体做法 ） 。	By contrast, Trump says he will leave Social Security as is, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make government spending more efficient and effective (though here he has not been specific).
今天，太阳能和风能仅能满足我们一小部分能源需求 — — 风能仅占总需求的0.7 % ， 而太阳能仅占0.1 % 。	Today, we produce only a small fraction of the energy that we need from solar and wind – 0.7% from wind and just 0.1% from solar.
一个以民主价值观和无与伦比的人类自由承诺而闻名于世的国家竟然堕落到去杀害无辜的男人、妇女和儿童，这种行径是非常可耻的。	It is shameful that a country known for its democratic values and its unparalleled commitment to human freedom should stoop so low as to kill innocent men, women, and children.
而特朗普则发推特说 ： “ 我惊讶地发现哈雷竟然是所有企业里第一个举白旗的 。 ” 并许下一个无法兑现的承诺 ： “ . . . . . .	Trump then took to Twitter to say that he was, “Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag.”
因此只是针对中国或任何其他国家而不去解决低储蓄的根本问题就像用手去挤一个灌了点水的气球：水只是跑到另一端而已。	Consequently, going after China, or any other country, without addressing the root cause of low saving is like squeezing one end of a water balloon: the water simply sloshes to the other end.
"由""无边界记者组织""发布的2003年度《世界新闻自由报告》将中国排在全部166个国家的中的第161位，大致位于伊朗和北朝鲜之间。"	The 2003 World Press Freedom report put out by the group Reporters without Borders ranks China 161st among 166 nations, somewhere between Iran and North Korea.
继承了决定其国民性的帝国传统的俄罗斯正在重新树立其在中东的地位和作用，堪与帝俄时代和斯大林时代相媲美。	Heir to an imperial tradition that has shaped its national identity, Russia is resuming in the Middle East a role and status more in tune with the one it had from the Czarist era to Soviet times.
问题在于缺乏可靠数据可以让保护特定物种的必要性显得抽象和不那么紧迫，削弱政府抵制其他更直接需求的能力，特别当牵涉到对相关人员的生计予以保护。	The problem is that the absence of reliable data can make the need to protect a species seem more abstract and less urgent, weakening governments’ capacity to resist other, more immediate demands, especially the need to protect relevant livelihoods.
在最近几十年中，中国利用国际社会对缅甸的孤立来为自己的战略利益服务，兴建了大量连接本国西部地区和印度洋的铁路，港口和输油管道。	In recent decades, China took advantage of the international community’s shunning of Burma to secure its own strategic interests, building highways, railways, ports, and pipelines that connect southern and western China to the Indian Ocean.
2014年11月，共和党完全控制了国会，压倒性的传统智慧认为奥巴马政府在其最后两年中不会有多少作为。	With the Republicans having taken full control of the Congress in November 2014, the overwhelming conventional wisdom was that the administration would be blocked from accomplishing much in its final two years.
简而言之，特朗普总统将联邦的教育，培训，环境，民用科学，外交，住房，营养以及其他民众急需的优先事项都排除在外了。	Trump would, in short, gut the federal programs for education, training, the environment, civilian science, diplomacy, housing, nutrition, and other urgent civilian priorities.
格鲁吉亚政府由于没有西方的明确的支持，可能会同意这一交易。 摩尔多瓦的天然气供应在元旦被切断，刚刚同意了类似的交易。	The Georgian government, without clear support from the West, may yet agree to such a deal, something that Moldova, which saw its gas cut off on January 1st, has just done.
自从2004年安全部队在卡米什利东北小镇杀害数十名手无寸铁的示威者以来，叙利亚库尔德人反抗执政40余年的阿萨德家族复兴党独裁统治的斗争就变得尤为艰苦。	For Syria’s Kurds, the struggle against more than four decades of the Assad family’s Ba’athist dictatorship became particularly harsh after 2004, when security forces killed dozens of unarmed protesters in the northeastern town of Qamishli.
马来西亚在减小不同族群之间的收入差距方面也成效卓越。 其做法不是削减高收入族群而是为低收入族群增收。	Malaysia has succeeded in markedly reducing the income divides that separated various ethnic groups, not by bringing the top down, but by bringing the bottom up.
而这笔债务是欧元区中最大的一笔 — — 大约2万亿欧元，或相当于其GDP的120 % — —这意味着意大利只能被帮助，不能被救助。	That debt is the largest in the eurozone – at roughly €2 trillion ($2.6 trillion), or 120% of the country’s GDP – which means that Italy can be helped, but not rescued.
其秘鲁人民革命同盟由德拉托尔在二十世纪二十年代创立，是该地区历史最长、最为与时代格格不入的民粹主义组织。	His APRA party, founded by Victor Raúl Haya de la Torre in the 1920’s, is one of the region’s oldest and most anachronistic populist organizations.
但欧洲仍把自己当作世界中心，以“传播文明”为名将对手送往非洲和亚洲，而完全没有注意到新世界的惨痛教训。	But a Europe that considered itself the center of the world, exporting its rivalries to Africa and Asia in the name of a “civilizing mission,” was utterly incapable of paying attention to the harsh lessons of the New World.
但是，由于沙特也想让叙利亚包括在阿卜杜拉国王的地区和平计划之中，以及美国计划在十一月举行地区和平会议，因此，沙特并不寻求与阿萨德无休止地对抗。	But, as the Saudis also want Syria to be included in King Abdullah’s regional peace plan, and with the US planning to hold a regional peace conference in November, they are not looking for an open-ended confrontation with Assad.
但是，尽管主要经济体采取了一些结构性改革以改善潜在增长，变化的速度远远赶不上潜力最大化的要求，规模也过于温和。	Yet, while major economies pursue some structural reforms to improve potential growth, the pace of change is much slower, and its scope more modest, than is needed to maximize potential.
我们甚至被告知，在今后几十年内，我们需要以前所未有的规模从空气中去除二氧化碳，而实现这一目标需要依赖完全未经测试的技术。	We are even told that within a few decades, we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on an unprecedented scale, with totally untested technology.
相反，在美国，有偏见的新闻报道，特别是社交媒体上的报道，对选民产生了强大的影响，也让政治极化达到了前所未有的程度。	In the United States, by contrast, biased news stories, especially on social media, appear to be having a powerful effect on voters, and have propelled political polarization to unprecedented levels.
如果央行在相当长的一段时间内坚持不升息，资产泡沫可能会继续发展 — — 不仅仅是股市和房地产市场，还包括（比如）虚拟货币 — — 导致另一场金融危机。	If central banks continue to postpone interest-rate increases for much longer, asset bubbles might develop – not just in the stock and housing markets, but also in, say, virtual currencies – leading to another financial crisis.
文在寅会对特朗普施加怎样的压力，让他采取不同的朝鲜方针，还有待观察，但有一点是确定的：特朗普在韩国人中间的地位不会让文在寅闭嘴。	How hard Moon presses Trump for a different approach to North Korea remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Trump’s standing among South Koreans won’t be what keeps Moon mum.
加州大学洛杉矶分校学者阿南亚·罗伊（Ananya Roy）指出，绝对贫困人群被剥夺了机会和改变地位的途径。	As the UCLA scholar Ananya Roy points out, people in absolute poverty are deprived of both the opportunities and the means to change their status.
如果欧盟能成功解决英国退欧问题，就可以抓住乌克兰和东南欧国家的投资机会，并以此来补充其政治资本及再次提高生产率。	If it succeeds in this, it can pursue investment opportunities in Ukraine and southeast Europe that stand to replenish its political capital and renew its productivity growth.
结果是史上最巨额的纳税人支持贷款，贷款条件为希腊追求严格的紧缩措施，以至于其公民损失了四分之一的收入，导致无从偿付私人或公共债务。	The result was the largest taxpayer-backed loan in history, provided on the condition that Greece pursue such strict austerity that its citizens have lost one-quarter of their incomes, making it impossible to repay private or public debts.
上海—近几年来，中国经济的运行轨迹不可不谓引人注目：从打破纪录的增长发动机沦为了重大全球风险，至少在某些人眼里是如此。	SHANGHAI – China’s economy has followed a remarkable course in recent years: from record-breaking powerhouse to major global risk, at least in the eyes of some.
这些又因为市场、投资者和消费者对于欧元取代各自国家的货币将作何反应的战略上的不确定性而变得更加复杂。	This was compounded by strategic uncertainty related to how markets, investors and consumers would react to the replacement of national currencies with the Euro.
人们只是希望此举能聊表慰藉，并给予那些与刘晓波志同道合的中国人以道义上的鼓舞；但对于那些笃信当前中国民族主义正统思想的人士而言，此举不太可能令其受到震动。	One hopes that this will lend comfort to him, and give a moral boost to Chinese who share his views. But it is unlikely to impress those who believe in the current orthodoxy of Chinese nationalism.
除了俄罗斯掌握的核武库以及作为联合国安理会常任理事国所享有的否决权外，其战略影响力的基础其实相对薄弱。	Aside from Russia’s nuclear arsenal and the veto power that it enjoys as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, its foundation of strategic influence is weak.
因此，金融市场对中国的重要性甚至比美国和欧洲还要高，并且有清晰的信号表明中国的投资生产率在快速下降。	Financial markets are thus even more important for China than for the US or Europe, and there are clear signs that the productivity of investment has been declining rapidly in China.
一个国家的国内政治经济制度改革与加入欧盟和北约通常都是相随而行的，因为选民们为了争取成员国资格往往愿意承受一些改革的阵痛。	Reform of a country’s political and economic institutions and its accession to the EU and NATO usually go hand in hand, because the prospect of membership makes painful decisions electorally acceptable.
2004年至2008年期间，曾长期以未来之国著称的巴西 — — “一直都是也永远都会是 ” — —其GDP年增长率为5.5 % 。	In 2004-2008, Brazil, which had been perennially known as the country of the future – as in “always has been and always will be” – recorded 5.5% annual average GDP growth.
媒体和国际货币基金组织（IMF）和其他机构的官方报告严重警告美联储的首次动作对金融市场和其他经济体的影响。	The media and official publications from the International Monetary Fund and other institutions have raised dire warnings about the impact of the Fed’s first move on financial markets and other economies.
在过去十几年中，女生在大学生中的比例从36%增至57 % ， 从1993年的不到15000人增加到2010年的436000人。	Their share of total college enrollment has increased from 36% to 57% over the last couple of decades, rising from less than 15,000 in 1993 to 436,000 in 2010.
这一趋势的受益者积累了足够的政治影响力来维持现状，凸显出在理解政策反应及其缺位的问题中受到太少关注的分配问题。	The beneficiaries of these trends may have accumulated enough political influence to maintain the status quo, highlighting distributional issues that have generally received too little attention in understanding policy responses or their absence.
十九世纪有记录以来最炎热的年份是2005、2010和2014，而去年的纪录几乎肯定会在今年被再次打破。	The hottest years since record-keeping began in the nineteenth century were 2005, 2010, and 2014, and last year’s record will almost certainly be broken again this year.
在这样的环境下，毫不奇怪普通公民会对未来深感不确定，对政府没有保护他们免受全球化副作用伤害深感失望。	In this context, it is not surprising that ordinary citizens feel uncertain about the future and frustrated with their governments, which have so far failed to protect them from globalization’s fallout.
此类政策给莫斯科赫尔辛基集团带来了沉重的打击，因为该机构被迫选择失去其大部分资金，进而解雇大部分员工。	Such policies have hit the Moscow Helsinki Group hard, because it was forced to choose losing much of its funding and, in turn, its staff.
这里的要点不是要抛弃经济学的伟大成就于不顾，而是要创造我们所谓的“人文经济学 ” ， 即让每个学科都保持自身独特的品质。	The point is not to abandon the great achievements of economics, but to create what we call a “humanomics,” which allows each discipline to keep its own distinctive qualities.
而且，像新闻主笔急于提醒我们的那样，在世界金融体系在次级抵押贷款危机下岌岌可危以及美国进入衰退的时候，本回合失败的负面影响尤其巨大。	And, as the editorialists hasten to remind us, the downside is especially large at a time when the world’s financial system is reeling under the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the United States is entering a recession.
所谓的买春法规定购买性服务为犯罪（但出卖性服务非罪 ） ， 瑞典、挪威、冰岛和北爱尔兰都已经实施了该法。	The so-called Sex Buyer Law, criminalizing the purchase, though not the sale, of sexual services has been implemented in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Northern Ireland.
全球金融体系在2008年近乎崩溃后触发的大幅衰退几乎让每个人都猝不及防，包括那些原本被认为最有能力去预见其降临的专家。	The deep recession that followed the near-collapse of the global financial system in 2008 caught nearly everyone by surprise – including the experts who were presumably the best equipped to see it coming.
最关键的是，报告呼吁加强全球金融安全网，以确保各国针对资本流过度波动和自我实现的金融市场恐慌做好准备。	Most crucially, the report calls for an enhanced global financial safety net to ensure that countries are well protected against excessive capital-flow volatility and self-fulfilling financial market panics.
与此同时，极端分裂已经成为其任期内的政治标志， 叙利亚、黎巴嫩和加沙地带潜在战争的战鼓声更是震耳欲聋。	At the same time, extreme divisiveness has become a political hallmark of his tenure, and the drumbeat of potential war in Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza has grown deafening.
农业是主要经济活动，主要分布在广袤的尼日尔河内陆三角洲，这里也是众多部落的大本营，包括以雕塑和建筑著称的多贡族（Dogon ） 。	Agriculture is the main economic activity, notably in the vast internal delta of the Niger River, home to many tribes, including the Dogon, a people remarkable for their sculpture and architecture.
但是，在一个普京式的政权中，政府决定了谁可以称为候选人，网络摄像头根本就是一场闹剧，不能让任何人害怕。	But, in a regime like Vladimir Putin’s, where the government decides who may be a candidate, the webcams would be farcical were they not also so intimidating.
事实上，从1965年到1990年，阿根廷的实质人均GDP下降了15 % ， 而这25年期间亚洲某些经济体却增长了5倍。	In fact, real GDP per capita declined 15% over the 25-year period from 1965 to 1990 – a period that saw some Asian economies quintuple in size.
一些人认为安理会授权是必不可少的绝对条件，也有人认为在没有授权的情况下出于权宜之计进行人道主义干预可以成为“严格定义的例外情形 ” 。	Some argued for an absolute requirement of Security Council authorization, while others recognized an imperative to contemplate humanitarian intervention without such authorization in “very narrowly defined exceptional cases.”
弗里德曼说，公司应该“赚尽可能多的钱，与此同时要遵守社会的基本规则，既包括法律中写的规则，也包括世俗伦理规则 。 ”	In his words, companies should “make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.”
但发达国家和新兴经济体的结构改革都远低于最优水平，因为结构改革的成本和混乱是前置的，而收益要到中期和长期才能显现。	But such reforms are occurring at suboptimal rates in both advanced and emerging economies, because all of the costs and dislocations are frontloaded, while the benefits occur over the medium and long term.
经济增长模式、地缘政治局势、实现人类团结的社会契约、以及地球生态系统都在经历彻底而同时的变革，让人感到焦虑，也让很多地方陷入了动荡。	Economic growth patterns, the geopolitical landscape, the social contract that binds people together, and our planet’s ecosystem are all undergoing radical, simultaneous transformations, generating anxiety and, in many places, turmoil.
尽管经济萧条，伊朗仍然好斗不已，通过其黎巴嫩代理人真主党发动了至少一次针对以色列的成功的无人机空袭，最近，据说还发动了网络袭击。	Amidst a crumbling economy, the country remains belligerent, using its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, to launch at least one successful drone flight above Israel and reportedly initiating recent cyber attacks.
相反在中国，尽管自从毛泽东主义消亡以来，人们获得了许多的个人自由，但是他们并不能自由地建立任何不是受到共产党控制的组织。	In China, by contrast, while individuals have regained many personal freedoms since the death of Maoism, they are not free to organize anything that is not controlled by the Communist Party.
的确，巴勒斯坦权力机构在困难的情况下执政，但是，又有哪一个新的解放运动在最终必须执政管理的时候不是面临严重的挑战呢？	To be sure, the new Palestinian Authority (PA) took power under difficult conditions, but which new liberation movement does not face serious challenges when it finally must govern?
哥本哈根—尽管寿命预期有了提高、教育更加普及、贫困和饥饿率也有所下降，但世界在改善人民生活质量方面仍有很长的路要走。	COPENHAGEN – Despite gains in life expectancy, expanded access to education, and lower rates of poverty and hunger, the world has a long way to go to improve the quality of people’s lives.
修正教育并非一两天就能完成的事情 — — 自20世纪70年代的福特开始，历任美国总统都呼吁进行教育改革，但收效甚微。	There are no easy and quick fixes to education – every US president since Gerald Ford in the mid-1970’s has called for educational reforms, with little effect.
我已与双方领导人进行了长时间的讨论（其中既包括单独讨论，也包括双方都在场的讨论 ） ， 我向他们说明：塞浦路斯的命运完全掌握在其手中。	First, there is a strong, shared commitment between Christofias and Talat. They have met almost 70 times over the past 16 months, including two weeks of intensive talks immediately prior to my visit.
乌克兰本身拥有欧洲第三大储量；其他拥有庞大储量的国家包括波兰、法国、中国、印尼、澳大利亚、南非、阿根廷和墨西哥。	Ukraine itself has the third-largest reserves in Europe; other countries with large deposits include Poland, France, China, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, and Mexico.
在危险的时代，当风险的出现、时机和扩散都可能造成瘫痪性后果时，重要的不仅是我们取得什么成就，而是我们如何取得成就。	In perilous times, when the emergence, timing, and diffusion of risks can have a paralyzing effect, what matters is not simply what we accomplish, but how we accomplish it.
按照格雷厄姆的说法 ， “ 一个衰落的俄罗斯至多可以凭借乌拉尔以东稀少的人口及其广袤的资源成为大国，尤其是中美两国争夺的对象 。 ”	According to Graham, “At the extreme, a weak Russia, with its vast resources and sparse population east of the Urals, could become the object of competition among the great powers, notably China and the United States.”
他认为创造力被一种叫社团主义（corporatism）的公共哲学所桎梏，只有通过彻底改革金融和其他领域的私人机构才能重塑个性和活力。	He believes that creativity has been stifled by a public philosophy described as corporatism, and that only through thorough reform of our private institutions, financial and others, can individuality and dynamism be restored.
真正的浮动汇率发挥了其作用：消除积累外部债务的诱因，激励了实体经济内部的灵活性，并促进了深度兼具流动性的资本市场的发展。	Truly floating exchange rates generally served their purposes: removing the incentive to accumulate external debt, encouraging flexibility within the real economy, and promoting the development of deep and liquid capital markets.
最有力的证据显示美国人每天平均看电视5小时以上 — — 别忘了在看电视之前他们还花了几个小时在其他的视频设备上，这是一个多么惊人的数字啊。	The best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average – a staggering amount, given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices.
· 单位劳动力成本大幅下降，可以通过加速结构改革、让生产力增长快于工资增长来实现。 这也是不可能的，因为德国走完这一重塑竞争力之路花了足足15年。	· A rapid reduction in unit labor costs, via acceleration of structural reform and productivity growth relative to wage growth, is also unlikely, as that process took 15 years to restore competitiveness to Germany.
仅有一种假设情景可以在保障环境可持续性的同时改善人类福祉：那就是向非常规政策和措施转型所带来的“转型变革”之路。	There is just one scenario that can deliver improvements to human wellbeing in an environmentally sustainable way: the path of “transformational change,” brought about by a shift to unconventional policies and measures.
实际上，为了追求国家的经济稳定，奥巴马的领导班子显然正往施行某种政府干预的方向努力，而在过去二十年里，中国一直推行着这种政府干预。	Indeed, in pursuit of national economic stability, the Obama administration is clearly moving towards the kind of government intervention that China has been promoting over the past two decades.
如今在放弃了最初的计划之后，共和党人声称他们希望实施一项不会对财政收入构成影响的减税措施，其中包括不会对最顶端1％的高收入者进行减税。	Now, after abandoning their initial plan, Republicans claim they want a revenue-neutral tax cut that includes no reductions for the top 1% of earners.
通过支持外语教学和资助学生交流，他们就能像《阿拉伯发展报告》中规定的那样，帮该地区的人们实现自己的目标。	By supporting the teaching of foreign languages and financing student exchanges, they can help people in the region accomplish their own goals as spelled out in the Arab Human Development Report .
而共同货币脆弱性的根源则来自于《马斯特里赫特条约》框架的缺陷，该框架规定欧元区成员国在维持共同货币政策的同时可以制定符合共同财政规则的单一财政政策。	At the root of the common currency’s fragility are flaws in the Maastricht Treaty framework, which dictates that eurozone members maintain a common monetary policy and individual fiscal policies that conform to shared fiscal rules.
与此同时，大多数新兴市场国家拥有足够强大的财政实力，也有足够的汇率变化空间去实现一场非破坏性的调整以应对适度提升的全球利率。	Moreover, most emerging-market countries have strong enough fiscal positions and can afford flexible enough exchange rates to manage a non-disruptive adjustment to moderately higher global interest rates.
新千年伊始之际，世界各国领导者们庄重许诺，将致力于寻求和平方案、解决贫困问题，创造一个更为清洁的环境。	When the millennium opened, world leaders pledged to seek peace, the end of poverty, and a cleaner environment.
同样是这些共和党人，在赞成限制政府开支的同时又阻挠对国会程序进行制度改革。 这些改革是限制开支所必需的。	These same Republicans also argued for government spending restraint while blocking the institutional changes to Congressional procedures needed to make spending restraint possible.
事实上，债权人理应承担更大的责任：通常它们是成熟的金融机构，而借款人常常不太适应市场的变幻莫测以及与不同契约安排有关的风险。	In fact, creditors arguably are more responsible: typically, they are sophisticated financial institutions, whereas borrowers frequently are far less attuned to market vicissitudes and the risks associated with different contractual arrangements.
将这一借款权外包给国家投资银行只是一个释放信号的办法，表明任何新增借款都会被用于投资，而不会被用于当前支出。	Outsourcing such borrowing power to a National Investment Bank is merely a way to signal that any additional borrowing will be used for investment, not for current spending.
对畜牧动物所受待遇表示担忧的人绝不仅限于数量不多的素食者或严格素食主义者，也就是不吃一点动物产品的人。	Concern about how we treat farm animals is far from being limited to the small percentage of people who are vegetarians or even vegans – eating no animal products at all.
这些装置可以使动物在某种程度上控制它们生活的环境，比如通过移动到笼子的另一层或躲起来以逃避生活在同一只笼子内的其他动物的攻击。	Such devices enable animals to exert some control over their environment, such as escaping an attack from a cage-mate by moving to another level in the cage or hiding.
她也许不会强调缅甸的实际需要 — — 严肃的土地改革、反腐运动、将经济从寡头控制中解放出来 — — 而是陷入为不受欢迎的少数群体的辩护。	Instead of highlighting the country’s real needs – serious land reform, an anti-corruption drive, and freeing the economy from oligarchic control – she may instead be drawn into defending an unpopular minority.
美联储在有目的地破坏激励系统 — — 具体地说，是在扭曲资金价格所提供的信号 — — 这将会导致投资不当（而当公债被货币化时，还会产生通货膨胀 ） 。	The Fed is purposefully and insidiously distorting the incentive system – specifically, signals provided by the price of money – resulting in mal-investment (and, when public debt is monetized, inflation).
类似地，从2000年到2014年，33个州实行了各自的能源政策 — — 有的制定了广泛的气候行动计划，有的建立了可再生能源标准 — — 既减少了二氧化碳排放，也扩张了经济。	Likewise, from 2000 to 2014, by enacting a variety of energy policies – from broad climate action plans to mandated renewable-energy standards – 33 states cut carbon dioxide emissions while expanding their economies.
首先，那些离开的人通常是在意大利政府的资助下接受教育：每个大学毕业生整个学习生涯的总花费约为60万美元。	First, those who leave are usually educated in Italy at government expense: around $600,000 for the full school career of each college graduate.
大众欧洲的代表是领衔英国退出运动的英国独立党（Independence Party ） ， 它们就像莫内的反面，抓住TTIP或乌克兰入盟协定等外交妥协，将它们内部政治化。	The demotic Europe, exemplified by the UK Independence Party, which helped spearhead Brexit, is like Monnet in reverse, taking diplomatic compromises like the TTIP or the association agreement with Ukraine, and intentionally politicizing them.
从永恒的角度来看这样的不幸相对无关紧要，可是如果没有不幸，或者至少没有大部分不幸，这个世界将更美好。	Relatively insignificant as this suffering may be from the perspective of eternity, the world would be better without it, or at least without most of it.
伊拉克观察家乔尔·韦恩指出，公共部门就业从2005到2010年翻了一番，现在占到全职劳动力约60%的份额。	And, as Iraq observer Joel Wing has pointed out, public-sector employment doubled from 2005 to 2010, and now accounts for roughly 60% of the full-time labor force.
从长期看，卡斯特罗时代的结束加上对美关系的改善可能带来类似于西班牙在弗朗哥倒台后所走过的向完全的自由民主的转型。	In the longer term, the end of the Castro era, together with improved relations with the US, is likely to bring about a repeat of Spain’s transition toward full-fledged liberal democracy after the fall of Francisco Franco.
在选战期间，他似乎认识到，实现好的经济结果比政治身份政治更重要。 他的政党在政治身份政治方面臭名昭著。	During the election campaign, he seemed to recognize that achieving good economic results was more important than the politics of religious identity for which his party had been notorious.
斯大林的一位主要计划官员层被问及为何要为一系列荒唐的方案辩护，他的回答堪称经典 ： “ 我宁可站着制定（stand for）不现实的计划，也不要坐着（牢，sit in jail）制定现实的计划 。 ”	"When one of Joseph Stalin's chief planners was asked why he was willing to defend a series of ludicrous proposals, he famously replied, “I'd rather stand for unrealistic plans than sit [in jail] for realistic ones."""
香港政府认为可以不顾民众意见，在大多数功能性立法委员和少数亲政府的直选立法委员的支持下强行通过该议案。	Hong Kong's government felt it could ignore public opinion and push the bill through with a large majority of the functional members, plus a handful of directly elected pro-government legislators.
报告还强调，流行病在中等收入国家正在快速转变，而可传染、产妇、新生儿和营养失调在撒哈拉以南非洲根深蒂固。	It also highlighted the rapid pace of epidemiological transition in middle-income countries and the persistence of communicable, maternal, newborn, and nutritional disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa.
但在常规环境下，国家公共预算已能自动起到稳定作用 — — 通过失业保险、累进税收等措施实现 — — 并且这是一个衍生功能，而非主要目标。	But, under normal circumstances, national public-sector budgets already perform the stabilizing role automatically – through unemployment insurance, progressive taxation, and the like – and this is a derived role, not the primary objective.
古生物学、考古学以及（尤其是）遗传学的最新发现表明，现在的人类和一些古代人具有惊人的相似之处，这让评估现代人起源的工作更加复杂了。	Recent discoveries in paleontology, archaeology, and especially genetics of striking similarities between extant humans and some ancient populations are further complicating assessments of modern humans’ origins.
从中东到拉丁美洲和亚洲，许多专制政权或正逐渐采取步骤朝着更民主和更负责任的政府形式的方向迈进，或已成为羽翼丰满、功能完善的民主政体。	From the Middle East to Latin America and Asia, many autocracies are taking gradual steps towards more democratic and accountable forms of government, or have become fully-fledged and well functioning democracies.
这些发展趋势挑战了欧洲的价值、社会模式的可行性以及世界的长期安全，因此欧洲领导人必须专注于构建新的能源体系以确保可靠供给、合理定价和生态可持续性。	As these developments challenge Europe’s values, its social model’s viability, and the world’s long-term security, EU leaders must focus on building a new energy system that ensures a reliable supply, sensible pricing, and ecological sustainability.
东京—20世纪60年代，当莫洛伊斯兰解放阵线（Moro Islamic Liberation Front，简称MILF）游击队在菲律宾揭竿而起时，费迪南德·马科斯（Ferdinand Marcos）还没有成为总统，更不用说变成独裁者了。	TOKYO – When the Moro Islamic Liberation Front guerrilla movement took up arms in the Philippines in the 1960’s, Ferdinand Marcos had yet to become the country's president – let alone dictator.
事实上，在2008至2009年间外部融资突然断流的时候，希腊就已经存在着非常庞大的经常账户赤字 — — 规模超过GDP的10%以上，迫使其对国内支出进行调整。	In fact, Greece was running very large current-account deficits – exceeding 10% of GDP – when external financing dried up suddenly in 2008-2009, forcing an adjustment in domestic spending.
为了理解科学之于欧洲的作用，关键是要先明确科学 — — 也就是由好奇心驱动的尖端研究 — — 不能给欧洲带来什么：不能得到立即可以商业化的研究成果。	In order to understand what science can do for Europe, it is important to clarify what science – that is, curiosity-driven frontier research – cannot do for Europe: deliver results that can immediately be commercialized.
毕竟，真主党是黎巴嫩在抵抗以色列1982年入侵时的产物。 现在它正通过将自己刻画成阿拉伯—伊斯兰事业，也就是在巴勒斯坦问题上的领军人物，而努力重树自己在国内和更广泛地区的影响力。	Hezbollah is, after all, a creature of Lebanon’s resistance to Israel’s 1982 invasion, now trying to reassert its influence at home and in the wider region by portraying itself as a champion of the Arab-Islamic cause, namely in Palestine.
为了在此基础上更进一步，日本承诺下个月开始大规模财政扩张，有人称之为零散性、暂时性“直升机撒钱 ” （ 政府债务永久货币化 ） 。	To build on these gains, Japan has promised a large fiscal expansion next month, which some describe as a piecemeal, temporary version of so-called “helicopter drops” (permanent monetization of government debt).
如果上个月在北京讨论的方案能够实现的话，因此产生的自贸协议将在整合程度以及对世界经济的重要性方面超越北美自贸协议。	But if the proposals discussed in Beijing last month are realized, the resulting FTA could surpass NAFTA in its degree of integration and importance to the world economy.
但这项工作相当繁重，美联储官员塔鲁罗（Daniel Tarullo）承认 ， “ 清晰完整的解决方案还没有成型 。 ”	But it is uphill work, and Daniel Tarullo, a governor of the Federal Reserve, has acknowledged that “a clean and comprehensive solution is not in sight.”
2001年阿根廷单方面违约后，许多投资者更加认清了需要事先明确允许不太极端的替代方案，因此在债务契约中引入了所谓的“集体诉讼条款 ” 。	After Argentina’s unilateral default in 2001, many investors saw more clearly the need to allow explicitly for less drastic alternatives ahead of time, and so incorporated so-called “collective action clauses” into debt contracts.
瑞典首相洛夫文9月在蒙特利尔表示 ， “ 今天我们关注全球基金，但愿我们明天不要忘记为整个全球卫生安排提供充足的资金 。 ”	As Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said in Montreal in September: “Today we are focusing on the Global Fund, but tomorrow let’s not forget to provide sufficient funding for the entire global health architecture.”
但采取可持续土地管理战略能够贡献实现巴黎气候协定所指定的、将全球变暖控制在前工业化水平以上2℃以内的目标所需要的短期减排量的三分之一强。	But adopting sustainable land management strategies could provide more than one-third of the near-term emission reductions needed to keep warming well below the target – 2°C above pre-industrial levels – set by the Paris climate agreement.
事实上，从2002年10月至2005年4月这31个月的实际（去除通货膨胀的影响）联邦基金利率是负的。	Indeed, the real (inflation-corrected) federal funds rate was negative for 31 months, from October 2002 to April 2005.
但她表示SEC有很多事情要做，此事得先等一等 — — 这无异于委婉地表示SEC像当年在天安门广场上请愿的学生那样，已经屈服于不可抵挡的压力了。	But she confessed that the SEC had many other items on its agenda, and had placed the issue on the back burner – a polite way to say that the SEC, like the heroic students in Tiananmen Square, had surrendered under irresistible pressure.
美国贸易代表（USTR）办公室提出了正确的概念，它的谈判目标覆盖了劳工问题和工资、透明度、腐败，以及一些人权问题。	The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has the right idea, with negotiating objectives that cover labor issues and wages, transparency, corruption, and some aspects of human rights.
在这种情况下，尽管查韦斯的政策没有使得其核心选民受益，但是他仍然可以我行我素。 超过一半的委内瑞拉人生活在困苦绝望之中。	In such circumstances, Chávez can afford to be bold, despite his policies’ failure to benefit his core constituency: the more than 50% of Venezuelans who live in destitution and despair.
你也许会想，茨威格会为二战后成立的联合国和布雷顿森林体系感到欣慰，更不用说此后数十年的复兴和和解时期。	One imagines that Zweig would have been comforted by the post-WWII creation of the United Nations and the Bretton-Woods system, not to mention the subsequent decades of reconstruction and reconciliation.
这种席卷全球富裕经济体的私人固定金额养老金的衰减是一件坏事，因为资产价格构成表明，年轻以及中年工人们极为重视固定金额的养老金。	This fall-off in private defined-benefit pensions all across the rich core of the world economy is a bad thing, because the configuration of asset prices suggests that young and middle-aged workers value defined-benefit pensions extremely highly.
比方说，一名前基地组织成员不久前曾经表示英国当局未能很好地解释不干预叙利亚内战的原因有可能进一步激化穆斯林的激进情绪。	A former Al Qaeda member, for example, recently stated that the UK authorities’ failure to explain properly why it had not intervened in Syria’s civil war risked radicalizing more Muslims.
亚特兰大 — — 波兰执政的法律与正义党（PiS）最近颁布的一部引起争议的法律因为将“波兰死亡集中营”这样的表述定义为刑事犯罪而引发了世界各国的广泛关注。	ATLANTA – A controversial law recently enacted by Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has attracted a tremendous amount of attention around the world for its criminalization of expressions like “Polish death camps.”
它不仅未能结束长期存在的巴以冲突，反而通过推翻伊拉克政府制造了新的问题。 西方在阿富汗出资支持圣战者，同时支持赞同其伊拉克、叙利亚、埃及和其他国家安全议程的独裁专制人员。	It failed to end the long-standing Palestinian conflict, and it created new problems by dismantling the Iraqi state, funding mujahedeen in Afghanistan, and backing dictators who supported its security agenda in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and elsewhere.
但捍卫作为这些起诉基础的核心原则也很重要，即普遍管辖权（universal jurisdiction）的概念。	But it is also important to preserve the core principle underlying these prosecutions: the concept of universal jurisdiction.
此外，哥伦比亚已经成为越来越具有吸引力的投资目的地，因为它在减少贫困，创造就业，基础设施发展和教育改革方面都取得了长足的进步。	Moreover, Colombia has become an increasingly attractive investment destination, as it has made great strides in poverty reduction, job creation, infrastructure development, and education reform.
亚努克维奇代表的是顿涅茨克派别，是几个地理上被定义为主张寡头政治的团体之一，这些团体争相控制乌克兰的商业和政治。	Yanukovych represents the Donetsk clan, one of several geographically defined oligarchic groups that compete to dominate Ukrainian business and politics.
许多人都担心这仅仅是长期冲突的开始，这样的冲突可能用到远超贸易范畴的武器，并带来远超贸易范畴的伤亡。	Many fear that this is only the beginning of a long conflict that could include weapons – and casualties – far outside the realm of trade.
就拿印度洋和其他东亚地区的领土纠纷来说吧。 中国一再地 — — 并且越来越坚决地 — — 主张其广大的海洋国土面积。	Consider the territorial disputes roiling the Indian Ocean and other East Asian regions, sparked by China’s repeated – and increasingly assertive – efforts to claim sovereignty over vast maritime areas.
11月，俄罗斯与巴基斯坦的外交关系也取得了突破，绍伊古（Sergei Shoigu）成为1969年以来第一个访问巴基斯坦的俄罗斯国防部长。	November was also a good month for Russian diplomacy in Pakistan, with Sergei Shoigu becoming the first Russian defense minister to visit the country since 1969.
并且，更常见的情形是他们观看的是个人成就 — — 山地车速降选手的凝神聚气、动如脱兔和勇气，或者体操选手完美规范的动作 — — 而不是真正的团队努力。	And, more often than not, what we are witnessing is individual achievement – the deeply concentrated agility and courage of the downhill racer or the finely disciplined movements of the gymnast – rather than true team effort.
事实上，糖的吸引力是造成加工食品业目前利润率保持在5 % （ 之前仅有1 % ） 的主要原因，这也能够解释为什么我们许多人生病、肥胖、愚蠢、破产、抑郁并陷入彻头彻尾的痛苦之中。	In fact, sugar’s allure is a big reason why the processed food industry’s current profit margin is 5% (up from 1%), and why so many of us are sick, fat, stupid, broke, depressed, and just plain miserable.
“为了给这片土地上的人民提供更好的生活， 应该更加关注实质而不是形式 。 ” 在即将举行就职典礼之前，奥巴马接受采访时如是说。	“In delivering a better life for people on the ground, one should be more concerned with substance than with form,” Obama stated in an interview just before his inauguration.
威尔逊无法像英法领导人常作的那样要求他的人民去“杀死德国佬 ” ， 因为威尔逊的太多战士至少从种族渊源上划分本身就来自德国。	Wilson could not implore his people to “kill the Krauts,” as British or French leaders frequently did, because so many of Wilson’s soldiers were, by ethnicity at least, Krauts themselves.
全球每年要生产3亿吨肉食，联合国粮农组织估算，如果需求继续按照当前增长率增长，2050年肉食产量将增加到4.55亿吨。	Worldwide, 300 million tons of meat are produced each year, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that the annual amount will increase to 455 million tons by 2050 if demand continues to grow at the current rate.
穷国可以效仿南非和博茨瓦纳，通过限��出口原始形式的原材料（这一政策在当地被称为“矿物增效 ” （ beneficiation ） ） 利用自然财富强行推动工业化。	Poor countries could follow the example of South Africa and Botswana and use their natural wealth to force industrialization by restricting the export of minerals in raw form (a policy known locally as “beneficiation”).
此外，贫穷地区经济活动较少，相应的税收总量也较低，阻碍了他们利用税收来提高人民生活质量和兴建基础设施。	Poor regions have a low base of economic activity to tax, which prevents them from investing in human and physical capital.
中国政府最近修改了税法，将雇主支付雇员退休金计划开支从应税所得中扣除，并且养老金计划中所累计的资金均可免税。	The Chinese government recently modified the tax law to exclude employers’ contributions to employee pension plans from taxable income and to allow the funds in those plans to accumulate tax-free.
来自心理学研究的第二个洞见由布鲁斯·胡德（Bruce Hood）在其新书《自我幻觉 》 （ The Self Illusion）中进行了总结。	The second insight from psychological research, summarized by Bruce Hood in his recent book The Self Illusion, relates to the role of consciousness in decision-making.
中国的外部收支已相当接近于平衡，因此我们大有理由认为人民币在自2005年中以来升值近三分之一后，已经相当接近“公允价值”了。	With China’s external position much closer to balance, there is good reason to argue that the renminbi, having appreciated by nearly one-third since mid-2005, is now within a reasonable proximity of “fair value.”
例如，德国总理安格拉·默克尔刚刚开始了她第四个四年任期 — — 欧洲其他国家大体对这种进展持欢迎而非批评态度。	For example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just begun her fourth four-year term – a development that the rest of Europe has largely welcomed rather than criticized.
首先，在债权国和债务国经济和金融差异越拉越大之时（目前已有人开始论及文化差异 ） ， 法国是联系南欧和北欧不可或缺的节点。	First, France is an indispensable link between southern and northern Europe at a time of growing economic and financial division between creditors and debtors (a fissure that has begun to assume a cultural dimension).
正如较受欢迎且一贯理智的Vox.com新闻网头条所言 ： “ 对于其他国家的穷人来说，没有什么比伯尼·桑德斯的言论最更可怕了 。 ” 。	“If you’re poor in another country, this is the scariest thing Bernie Sanders has said,” ran a headline in the popular and normally sober Vox.com news site.
拉丁美洲和南亚已经快速地提供了专业护理，但是，根据目前非洲的进步水平，在2015年的时候仍然有50％的妇女在生产时没有专业护理。	Latin America and Southeast Asia have rapidly increased coverage, but at the current rate of progress in Africa, 50% of women will still deliver without skilled care in the year 2015.

就算进去了，也对中国让自身货币成为国外私人及官方投资者广泛使用的第一流国际交易和储备货币的目标没什么影响。	Inclusion would make no difference in terms of progress toward China’s goal of developing its currency into a first-class international and reserve currency widely used by private and official foreign investors.
但是，尽管我总是会选平均水平的司机而不是两分水平的司机，但由于在选择两分司机和瞎选之间，我还是会选择两分司机，因为害怕选到更差的司机让我不会选择冒险。	But, while I would always pick an average driver over a driver with a rating of two, given the choice between a two driver and a blind pick, I might pick the two, because the fear of someone even worse would keep me from taking a risk.
一些证据表明，新的东盟经济共同体（地区自由贸易协定框架）正在帮助东南亚国家抵御日益动荡的全球经济环境。	Some evidence also suggests that the new ASEAN Economic Community, a framework for a regional free-trade agreement, is helping Southeast Asian countries weather an increasingly turbulent global economic environment.

叙利亚国内和周边地区还分布着竭力拓展自身势力的极端伊斯兰团体 — — 他们反应迅速，擅长利用任何国家出现的动荡局势。	The region in and around Syria is also populated by extremist Islamist groups that are attempting to expand their spheres of influence - and that are quick to capitalize on instability in any country.
现今，在颇具争议的大选后于2007年6月掌权的Umar Yar’Adua总统誓愿在2020年将让尼日利亚跻身全球前20大经济体的行列。	Nowadays, the mantra of President Umar Yar’Adua, who took power in June 2007, following controversial elections, is to transform the country into one of the world’s 20 largest economies by 2020.
当和平面临严重威胁时，比如眼下的美朝僵局，联合国政治事务局通常会站出来为重要的幕后外交斡旋提供便利。	When a dire threat to peace arises, such as the current standoff between the US and North Korea, it is the UN’s Department of Political Affairs that often facilitates vital, behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
企业会持续对自己的工人进行投资和再投资，因为1951年制定的《共同决定法 》 （ Codetermination Law）规定后者在董事会中占有一个席位，令工人可以坚持要求企业这样做。	Companies invest and reinvest in their workers, because the latter can insist on it, possessing as they do a seat in the boardroom as a result of the 1951 Codetermination Law.

事实上，仅仅是叙利亚冲突就足以改变冲突图表 — — 如果将伊拉克、也门和利比亚的死亡人数包括进来，上升趋势将更加陡峭。	Indeed, the Syrian conflict alone has been enough to change the graph of conflict — and the upward trajectory becomes even steeper when the deaths in Iraq, Yemen, and Libya are included.
2011至2017年间，因避难申请被拒或被发现没有身份证件，欧洲潜在回流者数量达550万，比之前增加了4倍。	Technological disruption is also putting pressure on labor markets.
2009年，我即将成为乌干达第六名神经外科医师，在穆拉戈国立中心医院（Mulago National Referral Hospital，乌干达最高级的医院）就职。	In 2009, I was on track to become only the sixth neurosurgeon in Uganda, working at Mulago National Referral Hospital, the country’s main tertiary institution.
印度尼西亚是全世界婴儿死亡率最高的国家之一，该国棉兰（Medan）农村地区的助产士使用移动应用收集孕妇的医学数据。	In Indonesia, which has one of the world’s highest infant mortality rates, midwives in the rural area of Medan collect medical data from pregnant women using a mobile app.
此外，后计划检查程序并没有给予官方债权人“三驾马车 ” — —欧盟委员会、欧洲央行和国际货币基金组织（IMF ） — —想要的对希腊的支配权。	Moreover, the post-program surveillance procedure does not give the “troika” of official creditors – the European Commission, the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund – the leverage over Greece that they desire.
在如此紧张的局势下，毫不奇怪，在经历了七十年的间断后，反犹主义是否回归法国的问题正在全球引起轩然大波。	In this tense setting, it comes as no surprise that the question of whether anti-Semitism has returned to France, after a seven-decade hiatus, is making international headlines.
凯恩斯认为经济可能会陷入长期性的“不充分就业均衡 ” ； 在这种情况下，就需要某种外部刺激来使其恢复到更高的就业水平上。	Economies, Keynes believed, can become stuck in prolonged periods of “under-employment equilibrium”; in such cases, an external stimulus of some kind is needed to jolt them back to higher employment.
发自布鲁塞尔 — — 自2007~09年大衰退以来，大多数经济学家都开始将金融视为商业周期的关键驱动力，但对这一动力究竟如何运作方面还是缺乏全面的了解。	BRUSSELS – Since the Great Recession of 2007-2009, most economists have begun to regard finance as a key driver of the business cycle. But the precise dynamics are not yet fully understood.
而为什么这次情况会不同则可在奥斯卡·乔达（Òscar Jordà ） 、 莫利兹·舒拉里克（Moritz Schularick ） 、 艾伦M·泰勒（Alan M. Taylor）最近发表的论文里找到答案。	The reason why things were different this time can be found in a recently published paper by Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor.
所以，当工人和中层经理离开这些公司的时候，他们带走的不仅是许多重要的信息，而且通常也带走了他们公司的心脏和灵魂，从而对美国的竞争力产生深远的影响。	So, as workers and middle managers have been departing these companies, they have taken with them not only much critical information, but often also the hearts and souls of their enterprises, with profound effects on American competitiveness.
这样，各企业投资于扩大产能就越发具有价值。 它们把能够在今天分配给股东的现金交换用来获得更佳的市场地位从而可以在今后回报他们的股东。	This makes it more worthwhile for businesses to invest in expanding their capacity, thus trading away cash they could distribute to their shareholders today for a better market position that will allow them to reward their shareholders in the future.

从长远来看，遏制严重气候相关问题的唯一办法是制定更好的适应性战略，碳捕获和封存技术，以及无政府补贴即可规模生产的可再生能源。	Over the long term, the only way to limit serious climate-related problems is to develop better adaptation strategies, carbon-capture and sequestration technologies, and renewable-energy sources that can reach scale without government subsidies.
更重要的是，伊朗承诺遵守国际原子能机构附加协议，未来15年终，国际原子能机构可以随时随地获得其核计划的所有要素信息。	Most important, Iran has committed itself to apply the Additional Protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency, providing the organization with round-the-clock access to all components of its nuclear program for 15 years.
尽管突尼斯避免了灾难，但大部分其他受影响国家最终都陷入了混乱，而叙利亚的残酷内战更是助长了伊斯兰国的崛起。	While Tunisia has averted disaster, most of the other affected countries have ended up mired in chaos, with Syria’s brutal civil war facilitating the rise of the Islamic State.

中国在全球范围内难以与美国竞争的事实并不意味着它也不能在东亚范围内对美国形成挑战，否则有关台湾的战争就不可能了。	China’s inability to compete with the US on a global basis does not mean that it could not challenge the US in East Asia, or that war over Taiwan is impossible.

在“有效控制”边界问题的基础上更多地关注“贸易及多边问题 ” ， 因为在上述领域取得成功能够翻开两国关系史上更受人欢迎的“新”篇章。	With the border issue “effectively controlled,” there should be greater focus on “trade and multilateral issues,” where success could bring about a “new” and welcome “chapter” in bilateral ties.
从PiS支持的波兰总统安德烈·杜巴拒绝在前任议会所选定的三位宪法法庭法官面前宣誓就职开始，波兰面临着一场宪政危机。	Poland is experiencing a constitutional crisis that began when PiS-backed Polish President Andrzej Duda refused to swear in three Constitutional Tribunal judges chosen by the previous parliament.

归根结底，尽管收入增长、生育率下降是中国和很多发展中国家的共同特色，但高储蓄快增长的良性循环在中国的发展势头远比其他发展中国家更为强劲。	After all, the virtuous circle of high savings and rapid growth operates more strongly in China than in other developing countries where incomes are rising and birth rates are falling.
日内瓦报道－当瑞士国家银行（简称“瑞行 ” ） 最近将利率下调到0.25 % ， 该行宣布其将实行“定额放松”政策，实则是在紧跟美联储与英格兰银行所实行的措施。	GENEVA – When the Swiss National Bank (SNB) recently brought its interest rate down to 0.25%, it announced that it would engage in “quantitative easing,” following in the footsteps of the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.

马耳他自 1964 年独立以来议会里就只有两个政党，如今这两党还沆瀣一气搞寡头政治，垄断了该国一切事务。	There, the only two political parties represented in parliament since independence in 1964 have ganged up to ensure for themselves an oligarchic duopoly on anything that goes on in the country.
但即便健康服务使用水平相同 — — 比如非洲的HIV/艾滋病案例 — — 基于性别的预期让HIV阳性男性无法获得与需要相配的抗逆转录病毒药物。	But even when health-care use would be expected to be equal, such as care for HIV/AIDS in Africa, gender-based expectations impede HIV-positive men from obtaining antiretroviral drugs proportionate to their needs.
但对于一些经济学领域的人来说，这种将心理学研究纳入到经济学研究（哪怕只是其中一部分）的观念就足以对他产生多年的敌意了。	For some in the profession, the idea that psychological research should even be part of economics has generated hostility for years.
再加上令人堪忧的增长前景，美国股市将承受压力，而就业和家庭收入的下降可能导致美国和中国都蒙受巨大的GDP损失。	That, together with diminished growth prospects, would depress equity markets, and declining employment and household income could lead to a sizeable loss of GDP in both the US and China.
如今，显而易见世界上许多经济体正在经历某种结构性变化，并且，这一变化导致了“就业岗位-生产率-收入”分配三角发生倾斜。	It should be evident by now that many of the world’s economies are undergoing some form of structural change, and in the wake of that change, the “jobs-productivity-income” distribution triangle has gone askew.
其实，早在1979年Howard Morland就在《进步》杂志上公开了氢弹的“秘密 ” ， 当时美国政府还提出起诉，企图查禁，不过败诉了。	Indeed, the “secret” of the hydrogen bomb was published in 1979 in an article by Howard Morland in The Progressive magazine, sparking a failed legal suit by the US government to suppress it.
此外，积极的反恐措施和修建隔离墙成功地抑制了跨境袭击，并随着冲突的不断发酵而导致巴勒斯坦内部压力越积越多。	Moreover, aggressive counter-terrorism activities and the separation barrier have decisively reduced cross-border attacks, containing mounting pressure in Palestine as the conflict remains on the back burner.
但20世纪80年代以来的教训是只要有助于维护合理开放的世界经济，超级全球化的某些逆转并不一定是件坏事。	But the lesson from the 1980s is that some reversal from hyper-globalization need not be a bad thing, as long as it serves to maintain a reasonably open world economy.
但如果各国想要在女孩保护和赋权方面取得成功，就必须做好一个关键步骤：扩大人乳头瘤病毒疫苗的普及度。 人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）是绝大部分宫颈癌的致病原因。	But if countries are to succeed in protecting and empowering girls, they must also embrace the promise of a key initiative: to expand access to the vaccine for human papillomavirus, which causes the vast majority of cervical cancer cases.
将养老金系统视为管理 — — 失业、疾病、利率波动、猝死或长寿 — — 风险的一种方式对解决问题会有所帮助。	To address that problem, it helps to think of any pension system as a way of managing risks – of unemployment, illness, volatile interest rates, sudden death, or a very long life span.
货币联盟之所以成为你可能，唯一的原因是欧盟国家间已经实现了深度一体化 — — 而共用一种货币深化了这个一体化。	Monetary union is possible only because of the substantial integration already achieved among European Union countries – and sharing a single currency deepens that integration.

用某高级非政府组织人权领导者的话说 ， “ 它们在惩罚叙利亚人民，原因是它们不满北约下令保护利比亚平民，最终却变为下令改变利比亚体制 。 ”	In the words of a senior NGO human rights leader: “They’re punishing the Syrian people because they were unhappy that NATO took the mandate of protecting civilians in Libya and transformed it into a mandate for regime change.”
八国集团为了挽救其信誉度，就需要再一次明确表明它将会履行承诺，到2010年每年向非洲增加援助250亿美元。	To salvage its credibility, the G-8 needs to make crystal clear ­– once again – that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to Africa by $25 billion per year by 2010.
我们的选民不可能在不必担心精神错乱的情况下在某次选举中选择某一个方向，而在下一次选举中选择另一个截然相反的方向。	Our voters cannot stroll in one direction during one poll, and in the opposite direction the next time they vote, without worrying about falling over the edge.
事实上，除了在圣诞前夜宣布削减预算，美国驻联合国大事尼基·哈雷（Nikki Haley）还警告美国着眼于进一步削减预算。	Indeed, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, accompanied the Christmas Eve announcement with a warning that the US would be on the lookout for further reductions.
类似地，基于技术的医疗通过手机或平板电脑实现，能够改善健康结果，即使是最偏远地区的妇女也能获得这些服务，而不再需要冒风险长途跋涉去看医生。	Likewise, technology-enabled health care delivered via phone or tablet improves health outcomes, as it reaches women even in the remotest areas, sparing them a long and often risky trek to see a doctor.

在去年12月，白宫同意了共和党人提出的一项提案，将法案中一条关于限制各美国银行巨头过度投机行为的条款废除（而该提案的文本正是由花旗银行执笔的）	In December, the White House agreed to a Republican proposal to repeal a provision of Dodd-Frank that would have limited the risk-taking of the country’s largest banks (in fact, the proposal’s language was drafted by Citigroup).
在经济学方面，卡罗·阿尔贝托奖 — — 该奖项两年一度，颁发给40岁以下优秀意大利经济学家 — — 的8位获奖者中有7位是在国外顶尖大学就职。	In economics, seven of the eight recipients of the Carlo Alberto Medal, which is awarded biennially to an outstanding Italian economist under the age of 40, were teaching in elite foreign universities.
据埃默里大学的马诺基·贾殷说，每年美国有20万病人可以靠人工心脏维持更长的生命，每名患者花费20万美元，共400亿美元。 这是一个合理利用资源的国家吗？	In countries that provide free health care to their citizens, it is extraordinarily difficult for officials to tell anyone that the government will not pay for the only drug or medical device that can save their life – or their child’s life.
但在（比如）印度，流产是合法的，并且没有可比的计划生育政策，这一数字要显著更低 — — 也许没有印度卫生和家庭福祉部所公布的每年630,000起那么低。	But in, say, India, where abortion is legal and no comparable family-planning policy exists, the figure is significantly lower – though probably not as low as the 630,000 annual figure provided by the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
第一个要素是，法兰西共和国素来禁止在官方人口普查中，或者由政府机构或私营企业收集有关种族、宗教甚至是社会阶层的数据。	The first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enterprises – on ethnicity, religion, and even social class.
据两位麻省理工学院研究人员的新研究，最富有的1%的美国人要比最穷的1%多活近15年；而最富有的1%的美国妇女要比最穷妇女多活十年。	According to a new study by two MIT researchers, the wealthiest 1% of American men tend to live almost 15 years longer than the poorest 1%; and the wealthiest 1% of American women can expect to live ten years longer than their poorer counterparts.
一方面，由于二氧化碳是一种肥料，其水平的增加有利于农业，最大的积极效应也在于此，相当于GDP的0.8 % 。	On one hand, because CO2 works as a fertilizer, higher levels have been a boon for agriculture, which comprises the biggest positive impact, at 0.8% of GDP.
新德里 — — 过去八年来，随着中国在亚洲的姿态越来越激进，许多人批评美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马未能勇敢地面对这个亚洲巨人。	NEW DELHI – Over the last eight years, as China’s posturing in Asia became increasingly aggressive, many criticized US President Barack Obama for failing to stand up to the Asian giant.

MBS在玩火，美国总统特朗普则给了他相当广泛的支持，这是因为特朗普自己十分憎恶伊朗，也许还希望沙特阿拉伯支持美国领导的巴勒斯坦和平计划。	As MBS plays with fire, US President Donald Trump has offered him broad support, owing to his own animosity toward Iran and, perhaps, the hope that Saudi Arabia will support a US-led peace plan on Palestine.
将在下个月举行会晤的美国总统特朗普和中国国家主席习近平必须共同遏制朝鲜半岛的紧张局面 — — 在他们被发现没穿裤子之前。	US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who will meet next month, must work together to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula, before they are caught with their pants down.

发自哥本哈根 — — 针对全球变暖问题的讨论正越来越被某种思维所占据：它试图消灭那些“动机不纯”的想法，甚至还质疑民主辩论本身的价值。	COPENHAGEN – Discussions about global warming are marked by an increasing desire to stamp out “impure” thinking, to the point of questioning the value of democratic debate.
鉴于政府历史上显示出的干预市场及社会的能力，危机发生时，中国的上下阶层往往默认应依赖政府措施而非市场力量来应对，而不是容忍市场自身无序的自查自纠。	Given the government’s proven capacity to intervene, the default option during a crisis has been to rely on administrative measures rather than on market forces.
因此，我们要求全世界的政府和出资者给予产科应有的关注。 产科是全球一大卫生问题的显而易见的解决办法。	That is why we are asking governments and donors around the world to give midwifery the attention that it deserves as a commonsense solution to a global health problem.
同一时期世界其余国家净跨境投资头寸增加3万亿美元，主要原因是大宗商品繁荣，而随着中国经济减速，大宗商品已经回落。	The rest of the world’s net investment position strengthened by $3 trillion during this period, owing mainly to the commodity boom, which faded as China slowed.
引入西方式的租市场能够让囊中羞涩或无法获得父母亲支持的家庭移民到城市中（目前这样的家庭必须买房 ） 。	And the introduction of a Western-style rental market will allow families without substantial cash or parental support to move to cities (where families currently must purchase their apartments).
通过彻底放松管制，特朗普内阁实际正乞求企业损害消费者利益、破坏环境，而且从长远角度看，损害他们自身的利益。	By pursuing radical deregulation, the Trump administration is practically begging businesses to harm consumers, the environment, and, in the long run, themselves.
这有望改善土耳其的女性劳动力参与率 — — 目前平均水平为30%左右，但有大学文凭者高达72 % 。	This is likely to improve female labor-force participation in Turkey, which is around 30% on average, but 72% for those with a university diploma.

“系统重要性”成为维持不可逾越的准入壁垒的接口（也是高管希望自己的公司变得太大而不能倒的又一原因 ） 。	“Systemic importance” has become an excuse for maintaining impenetrable entry barriers (yet another reason why executives want their firms to be regarded as too big to fail).
"甚至没有人想到过给这种20世纪60年代曾被我们强烈反对的""分离而平等""理念取个名字：在平等的公共领域中存在着迥然不同的个人生活。"	"No one has yet found a name for this new version of the ""separate but equal"" doctrine that some of us fought so hard against in the 1960's: separate private lives in a common public space that is equal for all."
发自剑桥 — — 当巴基斯坦军队在斯瓦特谷地与塔利班浴血奋战之时，他们其实是在为巴基斯坦的精神而战。	CAMBRIDGE – As its army confronts, ever more bloodily, the Taliban in the Swat Valley, Pakistan is fighting for its very soul.
国际社会要么团结起来，共同应对贫困、资源耗尽和气候变化，要么下一代将面临资源战争、政治动荡和环境崩溃。	Either the global community will join together to fight poverty, resource depletion, and climate change, or it will face a generation of resource wars, political instability, and environmental ruin.
纽约—金融危机十年后，世界各地的经济环境或多或少地回归了常态，如今，民族主义民粹主义被视为全球复苏的最大威胁。	NEW YORK – With economic conditions returning more or less to normal around the world after a decade of financial crises, nationalist populism is now seen as the biggest threat to global recovery.
是否是因为大屠杀的记忆蒙蔽了以色列领导人的视野并扰乱了他们的思维 — — 那为什么在以色列建国之初大屠杀的影响却微乎其微？	Or perhaps the weight of Holocaust remembrance has blinded Israel’s leaders and distorted their thinking – in ways that, at the time the State of Israel was created, the Holocaust itself almost miraculously did not.
纽顿的枪击事件不但可怕可悯，而且反映了日趋常见的模式 — — 心理学家和精神专家已有深入研究的一种特殊的杀戮式自杀（murder-suicide ） 。	The shooting in Newtown was not only especially horrific and heartbreaking, but is also part of an increasingly common pattern – a specific kind of murder-suicide that has been carefully studied by psychologists and psychiatrists.
这些国家不仅在上述领域指标领先；而且可以从过去半个世纪的电脑、手机、互联网和铁氟龙等技术创新中受益。	Not only did these countries achieve better social indicators in these dimensions; they also could benefit from the technological innovations of the past half-century: computers, cellphones, the Internet, Teflon, and so on.

自动预算削减 — — 它可能让2013年增长降低了1.75个百分点 — — 在继续进行，但比以前温和了许多。	Automatic budget cuts – which reduced 2013 growth by as much as 1.75 percentage points from what it otherwise would have been – continue, but in a much milder form.
事实上，那位以最明确的态度告诉我，他对哪怕只是略微令人不快的事实也没有任何兴趣的众议员，即凯文·布雷迪（Kevin Brady）如今身居众议院筹款委员会（Ways and Means Committee）主席。 该委员会在税收政策方面起着关键作用。	In fact, Kevin Brady, the representative who told me most clearly that he was not interested in looking at even moderately inconvenient facts, is now Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, which plays a key role in what happens with taxes.
他们希望与会的决策者们知道他们的决定影响着普罗大众，而不只是担心通胀如何影响自己的债券的价值或升息如何影响自己的股票组合的金融家。	They wanted the assembled policymakers to know that their decisions affect ordinary people, not just the financiers who are worried about what inflation does to the value of their bonds or what interest-rate hikes might do to their stock portfolios.
无法掌控的历史大潮将前这位前克格勃陆军中校从不知名的角落席卷出来，带到了权力的顶峰，但命运也可能以同样的速度将他再次冲走。	A historical wave beyond his control had lifted the former KGB lieutenant colonel from out of the shadows to the pinnacle of power. But fate might also just as suddenly wash him away.
但在当前的政治气候下此举变得太过危险，许多农民只能举债喂养老牛，而在印度已经越来越难以承载如此庞大的牛只数量。	But, because that would be far too dangerous in the current political climate, many farmers are being driven into debt caring for old cows, while the cow population in India becomes increasingly unsustainable.
应该指出的是，在乌克兰，人们被迫发动一次又一次的革命 — — 先是推翻总统列昂尼德·库奇马（Leonid Kuchma ） ， 接着把维克托·亚努科维奇（Viktor Yanukovych）赶下台 — — 以防止这种体制的确立 (第三次革命是否正在酝酿之中尚待观察 ) 。	In Ukraine, it should be noted, revolutions have been required – first under Leonid Kuchma, and then under Viktor Yanukovych, to prevent such a system from being established (whether a third attempt is currently underway today remains to be seen).
因此他们找到了用来自我怜悯的共同语言，就像奥尔班、萨尔维尼，怀尔德斯和其他人声称被“达沃斯党”压迫一样。	Hence the common language of self-pity, as though Orbán, Salvini, Wilders, and the rest were being oppressed by the “Davos Party.”
但安倍同时参观、并表示希望回到被视为民族主义圣地的东京靖国神社，那里供奉着14名甲级战犯，所供奉的乙级和丙级战犯数更是超过1，000人。	But he did so while visiting – and voicing his wish to return to – Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, a nationalist pilgrimage site that commemorates, among others, 14 Class A and more than 1,000 Class B and C war criminals.
这些来自气候议会的呼声也汇入到了那些著名公众人物日渐增强的诉求之中 — — 他们提出我们需要清理自身的能源使用习惯。	The voices from the Climate Parliament join a growing crescendo of influential actors who are speaking out about the need to clean up our energy habits.
去年，民主刚果中部的开赛（Kasai）地区有140万人流离失所，使得失去家园的总人口达到了410万 — — 也是非洲规模最大的国内难民群体。	Last year, conflict in the DRC’s central Kasai region displaced some 1.4 million people, bringing the total displaced population to 4.1 million – the largest concentration of internal refugees anywhere in Africa.
只有认识到旧增长模式的弱点、追求必须的结构性改革，新兴经济体才能获得强劲、稳定和可持续的GDP增长 — — 并充分实现它们成为全球经济主要引擎的潜力。	Only by recognizing the weaknesses of old growth patterns and pursuing the needed structural reforms can emerging economies achieve strong, stable, and sustainable GDP growth – and fulfill their potential as the global economy’s main engines.
尽管用“无根游子”一词形容讨厌的犹太人的是斯大林，但反犹主义者认为犹太人是天生的布尔什维克，并且有可能连苏联也是他们把持的。	"Though it was Stalin who used the phrase “rootless cosmopolitans"" to describe unwanted Jews, anti-Semites believed that Jews were natural Bolsheviks and probably pulled the strings in the Soviet Union, too."
哥伦比亚 20世纪90年代曾经出现过这种状况，当时咖啡价格的意外下降拉低了咖啡主产区的收入，加剧了那里的紧张局势。	This occurred in Colombia in the 1990’s, when an unexpected drop in coffee prices lowered wages and intensified conflict in coffee-dependent regions.
如果说土耳其的货币政策实验给了我们什么教训，那就是国内审慎监管和货币政策工具应该被视为资本账户管理的补充而不是替代措施。	If there is a lesson to be learned from Turkey’s monetary-policy experiment, it is that domestic prudential regulations and monetary-policy tools should be viewed as complements to – not substitutes for – capital-account management.
但不管是法国对货币和信用的近乎完全的控制，还是其在政治和安全方面的强大影响力，都不能承担让法郎区国家陷于贫困和动荡陷阱无法自拔的责任。	But neither France’s near-total control of money and credit, nor its strong influence over politics and security, is wholly responsible for keeping the franc-zone countries mired in poverty and instability.
当我们可以完全将一个人的生命换算为货币，我们应该接受这个小小的胜利，然后再去追求大项目，大项目的价格也许更大，并且不能保证成功。	When we can completely transform someone’s life for pennies, we should accept that small victory before pursuing grand projects with even grander price tags and no guarantee of success.
在欧洲，包括欧洲央行在内的决策者要求重债国实行整合，但在谈判中态度颇为灵活；不过选民拒绝了这一要求 — — 最新的例子是意大利。	In Europe, policymakers, including the European Central Bank, demand consolidation for high-debt countries, but are flexible in negotiations; voters, however, reject it – most recently in Italy.
在某种层次上，这一事实令人沮丧：我们经济学家相信人们有足够的智慧理解周边的环境，也有足够的能力保护自己的利益。	On one level, this is very frustrating: we economists believe that people are smart enough to understand their situation and capable enough to pursue their own interests.
现在，当局正在利用一场打击“淫秽”互联网内容的斗争来清除政治敏感内容，包括对零八宪章的讨论。 中国网民在网上发现了这一亲民主的文章后有几千人签名。	Now, a new crackdown against “vulgar” Internet content is being used to clean up politically sensitive writings – including discussion of Charter 08 , a pro-democracy treatise signed by thousands of Chinese who discovered it online.
自去年11月以来，萨勒曼以可疑的罪名抓捕了数百名沙特精英阶层 — — 包括王子和在国际上赫赫有名的商人 — — 丝毫不顾法治。	Since last November, MBS has had hundreds of members of the Saudi elite – including princes and businessmen with international profiles – arrested on dubious grounds, and with no regard for the rule of law.
以移民为例，虽然绝大多数非法移民都在努力操持家庭并改善自己子女的生活，但也有些人犯下严重罪行或参加暴力团伙。	While the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants are working to support their families and improve the lives of their children, some commit serious crimes or belong to violent gangs.
但得益于公共资金的银行现在变得比以前更大，不透明的金融工具再一次成为时尚；银行家的奖金池也再一次溢满。	But the banks that benefited from public money are now bigger than ever; opaque financial instruments are once again de rigueur; and bankers’ bonus pools are overflowing.
毕竟，黎巴嫩已经比许多其他国家做出了大得多的贡献，在本地人口和经济饱受压力的情况下接收了超过一百万叙利亚难民。	After all, Lebanon has already done far more than many other countries, accepting well over a million Syrian refugees despite the intense pressure on the local population and economy.
热带农业国际中心负责人Joachim Voss出面确认这种黄豆已收入该中心的基因库，并确认这种黄豆原产于墨西哥。	Joachim Voss, then CIAT’s director, confirmed that the yellow beans were present in CIAT’s gene bank, and that they had originated in Mexico.
但除了伊朗之外，沙特阿拉伯和其他海湾国家、土耳其和埃及冲突双方等所有主要地区力量想实现这一目标都有充分的理由。	But, Iran aside, all of the region’s major players – Saudi Arabia and its fellow Gulf states, Turkey, and both sides in Egypt – have plenty of reasons to want to see it realized.
现在，剩下的只是朝鲜能不能将核弹头微型化，让洲际弹道导弹携带 — — 这一里程碑估计要不了几年就能实现。	All that is left now is for the North to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to be deliverable by such an ICBM – a milestone that is thought to be not more than a few years off.
但他是在疫情已经酝酿了几个月后才做出的这项决定，经过确诊的埃博拉病例达到6，000起，而且有不少病例尚未被发现。	But his decision came only after the epidemic had been smoldering for many months, with 6,000 Ebola cases confirmed and many more believed to be undetected.
更糟的是，当只有印度百分之一大小的国家在一个接一个的获得金牌而印度运动员只有在失利中才被提到时，我们都感受到了一天又一天等待印度出现在奖牌榜上的羞耻。	Worse yet, we have all known the shame of waiting day after day for India to appear on the list at all, as countries a hundredth our size record gold upon gold and Indian athletes are barely mentioned among the also-rans.
然而，在世界上那么多的连续冲突和没有任何结果的和平进程中，尼泊尔的成功故事应该得到世界的认可和支持。	Yet, amid too many continuing conflicts and failing peace processes around the world, a success story deserves to be recognized and supported.
日本的经济规模大约是美国的一半，其增长动力仍然很弱。 在2008年的第二季度，日本经济以2.4%的年化率收缩，这主要是因为疲弱的出口造成的。	In Japan, with an economy of about half the size of the US, growth forces remain weak. In the second quarter of 2008, the Japanese economy shrank at an annualized rate of 2.4%, primarily due to weak exports.
在国内方面，两党都承诺要治理腐败，颠覆它们所谓的谋私利的政治建制派，同时采取激进政策降低失业、重新分配收入。	On the domestic front, both parties have promised to tackle corruption and topple what they see as a self-serving political establishment, while introducing radical policies to reduce unemployment and redistribute incomes.
尽管日本NSC长期缺位，但对日本来说，现在成立NSC、获得它几乎必将带来的政策方向和一致性改进为时未晚。	Although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue, it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring.
印度环境部部长拉姆·拉梅什说 ： “ 在气候科学和气候传教之间是有清晰的区别的，而我本人站在气候科学这一边 。 ”	India’s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, declared: “There is a fine line between climate science and climate evangelism. I am for climate science.”
他们当代的继承者通过与主流的现代思想的全面接触，力求更好地了解如何通过穆斯林的传统表达伊斯兰的公理。	By engaging fully with the main currents of modern thinking, their contemporary successors seek to better understand how universal principles can be expressed through Muslim tradition.
尽管其他捐助国，包括加拿大和法国，有时会对洪森的侵权行为提出反对意见，但作为拥有最多筹码的美国政府在历史上一直是主要的指控方。	Although other donor countries, such as Canada and France, have at times spoken out against Hun Sen’s abuses, the US government, as the actor wielding the most leverage, has historically led the charge.
凯恩斯在1931年向英国议会提交的《麦克米伦报告（Macmillan Report ） 》 中建议，将进口关税与出口补贴配套使用这将实现与汇率贬值相仿的效应，同时又能维持黄金与英镑的平价关系。	In his 1931 Macmillan Report to the British Parliament, Keynes proposed that an import tariff be paired with an export subsidy, which would mimic the effects of exchange-rate devaluation, while maintaining the gold-pound parity.
通过推进全球化 — — 通过迫使民众吞下更多开放的苦果 — — 他们成功积累了大量财富，然后通过避税、离岸外包和其他见不得人的手段来加以保护。	By advancing globalization – by forcing ever-more openness down the people’s throat – they have accumulated massive wealth, which they then protect through tax avoidance, offshoring, and other schemes.
在功能生，这等价于刺激新一波“僵尸贷款 ” — —20世纪90年代贷给毫无偿债能力的日本借款人的不符合经济学原理的贷款。	This is the functional equivalent of promoting another surge of “zombie lending” – the uneconomic loans made to insolvent Japanese borrowers in the 1990s.
而亚洲基础设施投资银行或许无法做到的则是帮助提升亚洲的经济治理水平 — — 尤其是因为日本，澳大利亚，印尼和韩国这几个GDP总量加起来几乎与中国相等的国家尚未成为银行成员。	What the AIIB may not be able to do is contribute to improved economic governance in Asia – not least because Japan, Australia, Indonesia, and South Korea, whose total GDP is roughly equal to China’s, are not yet members.
还有最后一个令人痛苦的事实：如果说民粹主义的崛起反映了对再分配的要求，那么我们应该看到左翼而非右翼得势。	There is one final prickly fact to consider: if surging populism reflected a demand for redistribution, we would expect the surge to be on the left, not the right.
比如，德国在2003—2006年的改革大大地增加了灵活性（尽管它所处的全球和欧元区条件更为有利 ） 。	For example, the German reforms of 2003-2006 increased flexibility significantly (though in a more benign global and eurozone setting).
但对于可能的税收变化的细节，我仍然要看过去几年中由众议长保罗·瑞恩（Paul Ryan）及其同事们所制定的计划。	But for the details of the potential tax changes, I still look to the plans developed over the past several years by House Speaker Paul Ryan and his colleagues.
当我们回望二十世纪 — — 人类历史上经济增长最为成功的阶段，并作出推断的时候，我们也有带着选择偏误。	There is also the selection bias that we infer from looking at the twentieth century, the most successful in terms of economic growth in human history.
不难预测，这一讨论目前又陷入了国家模式：债权国不反对通缩，因为这增加了它们的投资的价值；而债务国的偿债负担会日益沉重。	The discussion has so far followed easily predictable national patterns: Creditor countries do not object to deflation, because it increases the real value of their investment, whereas debtor countries’ repayment burdens would grow heavier.
由于缺乏大规模常备部队（19世纪70年代，美国海军的规模还比不上智利 ） ， 美国在19世纪全球权力平衡中发挥的作用并不重要。	Lacking a large standing army (and with a navy that in the 1870s was smaller than Chile’s), the US played a minor role in the nineteenth-century global balance of power.
一直有人指责非国家行动者在叙利亚和伊拉克北部使用化学武器，这尤其令人担心，因为这增加了有毒化学品正在用于恐怖袭击的可能性。	Persistent allegations that non-state actors are using chemical weapons in Syria and northern Iraq are of particular concern, as they raise the possibility of toxic chemicals being used in terrorist attacks.
在伊拉克一战中，若美国能获得国际舆论的支持，那么它所采取的行动即使面对否决票也能获得一定的合法性，但是布什总统没有这么做。	In the case of the Iraq War, President Bush never established a broad consensus that might have provided legitimacy in the face of a veto.
尽管意识到美国并不是它一直宣称那样充满机会的事实令世界其他国家的人和美国人一样感到窘迫不安，但全球层面上的机会不平等更严重。	While the realization that America is not the land of opportunity that it has long claimed to be is as disconcerting to others as it is to Americans, inequality of opportunity at the global scale is even greater.
如果欧元想生存下来的话，欧元区成员国必须行动起来，而其他对欧洲一体化有不同程度承诺的成员国则依然处于边缘地位。	If the euro is to survive, eurozone members must act, while other EU members with various levels of commitment to European integration remain on the fringe.
根据一个可靠的、经过同行评议的模型，欧盟减排20%的效果在2100年也只能将变暖推迟两年，而其成本却将是每年约900亿美金。	According to one well-established and peer-reviewed model, the effect of the EU cutting emissions by 20% will postpone warming in 2100 by just two years, yet the cost will be about $90 billion annually.
他们没能看出美国官员认为叙利亚与巴勒斯坦、伊拉克和黎巴嫩领土上的伊斯兰恐怖组织串通一气，大搞恐怖活动。	They fail to see that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamist terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories, Iraq, and Lebanon.
认识到武装或支持任何地方的伊斯兰激进派最终都将助长国际恐怖主义，这样的便利联盟（alliances of convenience）应该避免。	Recognizing that arming or supporting Islamist radicals anywhere ultimately fuels international terrorism, such alliances of convenience should be avoided.
最近的金融危机爆发以来，修正这一失衡的必要性日益凸显，银行重建资本基础（以及满足更严格的监管要求）导致了信用配给现象。	The need to redress that imbalance has become increasingly evident since the recent financial crisis, as banks' efforts to rebuild their capital bases (and meet stricter regulatory requirements) has led to credit rationing.
遏制无序蔓延需要协调性的领地战略，以便各城市能够解决共同的问题，如商品运输、住房和服务集群以及产业走廊的管理和部署。	Limiting sprawl requires a coordinated territorial strategy, so that cities can address common concerns, like the transportation of goods, clustering of housing and services, and management and placement of industrial corridors.
上个月，这位同一个总统所统率的军队把一枚导弹瞄准了一个靠近阿富汗边境的巴基斯坦村庄达马多拉的一个房子。	Last month, the military forces that this same president commands aimed a missile at a house in Damadola, a Pakistani village near the Afghanistan border.
此外，他的提名将引起另一位德国人、欧洲央行理事会唯一的女委员劳腾施莱格尔（Sabine Lautenschläger）辞职。	Moreover, his nomination will trigger the resignation of another German, Sabine Lautenschläger, the only woman on the ECB’s executive board.
造成这种混乱的原因非常复杂，但归根结底，美国、欧洲和国际机构根本不愿为流离失所的穷人考虑是一切混乱的源泉。	Many factors contribute to this disarray, beginning with the shocking inability of the US, Europe, and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people.
与此同时，在俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司对其核心活动，即生产的投资持续下降的情况下，一场危机正在降临，而这需要欧盟出面来掌控局势。	Meanwhile, with investment in Gazprom’s core activity – production – steadily declining, a crisis is looming, one that requires the stewardship and steady hand of the EU.
为了认定是否应该放开人类器官移植或者使用雇佣兵参战，我们需要深刻思考与人类尊严和公民责任有关的问题。	To decide whether we should allow the buying and selling of human organs for transplantation, or hire mercenaries to fight our wars, we have to think through hard questions about human dignity and civic responsibility.
哈佛大学肯尼迪学院的兰特·普里切特为印度发明了一个新专属名词 ： “ 失控的国家 ” — —在这个国家里，能力卓著的政府高层无法控制低效的底层人员，从而影响了执政效率。	Lant Pritchett of the Harvard Kennedy School has coined a new name for India: a “flailing state” – a state where the government’s extremely competent upper echelons are unable to control its inefficient lower levels, resulting in poor performance.
只要拥有核武器依然是国家展示其大国地位最明确的方式，保持核武器的研发能力对伊朗这样的国家就极具诱惑力，甚至不惜作伪证。	As long as possessing nuclear weapons remains a state’s clearest way to demonstrate its bona fides as a great power, maintaining the potential to develop such weapons will be too tempting for countries like Iran to forswear.
但葛里萨的裁决却在鼓励高利贷行为，威胁了国际金融市场的运行，也践踏了现代资本主义的一条基本原则：资不抵债的债务人需要从新开始。	Griesa’s ruling, however, encourages usurious behavior, threatens the functioning of international financial markets, and defies a basic tenet of modern capitalism: insolvent debtors need a fresh start.
在休斯敦，当局为飓风哈维做好了准备，这部分来源于从飓风卡特里娜中所吸取的教训，卡特里娜曾于2005年将新奥尔良变成了一片废墟。	In Houston, authorities were ready for Harvey in part because of lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005.
当选的18名成员中（巴勒斯坦自治机构领导人穆罕默德·阿巴斯随后将增加任命4名成员 ） ， 不超过两位，即只有纳比尔·沙阿斯和穆罕默德·施塔耶是真正的温和派。	Of the 18 elected members (Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas will appoint four more later), no more than two (Nabil Shaath and Muhammad Shtayyeh) are really moderate.
与此同时，科技巨头也可以辩解说，如果它们可以更快地进入效率低下的生产和分销领域，尤其是移动支付，中国的整体生产率增长还能更快。	The tech giants, meanwhile, argue that if they could just move faster into inefficient production and distribution areas, not least mobile payments, productivity growth would accelerate.
坎登的巨大成功促使该基金会又资助了波士顿、克利夫兰、辛辛那提、西密歇根和加州洪堡县（Humboldt County）的类似实验。	The remarkable success in Camden has prompted the foundation to fund similar experiments in Boston, Cleveland, Cincinnati, western Michigan, and Humboldt County, California.
不甘落后的“尼基塔飓风”抓住一切机会搅动外交这趟浑水，边吹口哨边拍桌子 — — 甚至据说脱下鞋子来敲打桌面。	Not to be outdone, “Hurricane Nikita” used every opportunity to stir the diplomatic pot, whistling and banging his fists – and even, allegedly, his shoe – on the desk.
一些民主党人放下了他们的民族自豪感，说最近被《时代》杂志冠以欧洲国王名号的法国的年轻总统马克龙更适合介入接手伊拉克和伊朗问题。	Some Democrats swallow their national pride and say that France’s young president, Emmanuel Macron, newly crowned by Time magazine as king of Europe, is in a better position to step in and stay the hand of Iraq and Iran.
上个月，默克尔宣布自己不会再寻求连任总理，并且将在今年年底辞去基督教民主联盟（简称基民盟）的领导职务。	Last month, Merkel announced that she would not be seeking another term as chancellor, and that at the end of this year, she would step down as leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
在2007年“藏红花革命 ” （ Saffron Revolution）中勇敢面对缅甸军方的和尚，如今正在对该国穆斯林罗兴亚人行使暴力。	Some of the same Buddhist monks who braved Myanmar’s military junta in the “Saffron Revolution” of 2007 today incite violence against members of the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority.
人们对发生另一场欧洲战争的担忧促成了欧洲统一的梦想，天真地希望独立国家已经过时并将让位于出众的欧洲人，这种希望支持着该梦想，这个不切实际的梦想破灭了吗？	Was the dream of a unified Europe – inspired by fears of another European war, and sustained by the idealistic hope that nation-states were obsolete and would give way to good Europeans – a utopian dead end?
同时，在土耳其对待它的邻国的态度转变的时候，它的统治精英已经注意到欧盟把那些拥有更弱小市场经济和更短的民主历史的前共产主义国家接纳为会员。	Meanwhile, as Turkey’s attitude toward its neighbors has changed, its governing elite has watched the EU embrace ex-communist countries with far shakier market economies and shorter democratic records.
如果作为伯克（Edmund Burke）和贝恩（Tony Benn）的故乡的英国可以发生这种事，其他地方绝对也可以发生。	If it can happen here – in the homeland of Edmund Burke and Tony Benn – it truly can happen anywhere.
更令人担心的是强大的新网络、生物和纳米技术带来的不利风险：通过错误或者恐怖，一小撮人可能带来社会的急速崩塌，政府根本来不及响应。	Even more worrying are the downside risks of powerful new cyber, bio, and nanotechnologies: A few individuals, via error or terror, could ignite a societal breakdown so quickly that government responses would be overwhelmed.
因此，张成泽的处决是对中国国家主席习近平的直接挑战 — — 在常规情形中，这一动作将使中国中止、至少暂时削减对朝支持。	Chang’s execution was thus a straightforward challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping – a move that, under normal circumstances, would prompt China to suspend, or at least reduce, its support for North Korea.
美国尤其如此，市场非常欢迎美联储延长近零利率（负真实利率）政策、激进的政策指导以及资产购买方案的三管齐下 — — 所有这些都让投资者更多地承担风险。	This is most evident in the US, where markets love the Federal Reserve’s trifecta of near-zero policy interest rates (negative in real terms), aggressive forward policy guidance, and asset purchases – all of which push investors to take more risk.
也许约翰·斯坦贝克（John Steinbeck）说得对 ： “ 社会主义之所以未能在美国扎根，是因为穷人总觉得自己不是被剥削的无产阶级，而是暂时陷入困境的百万富翁 。 ”	Perhaps John Steinbeck got it right when he supposedly said that, “Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.”
实际上他们把注意力都放在了美国的外债上，却忽视了家庭负债（抵押贷款和消费者债务 ） 、 公共负债，商业债务和金融债务等方面的问题。	Instead, they focused exclusively on US foreign debt, ignoring household debt (mortgage and consumer debt), public debt, business debt, and financial debt.
考虑到我们面临的挑战（IPCC已清楚阐明其量级和性质 ） ， 下半年的哥本哈根会议必须就充分处理气候变化问题达成多边协议。	Given the challenge facing us, the magnitude and nature of which were clearly brought out by the IPCC, the Copenhagen Conference later this year must produce a multi-lateral agreement that deals adequately with climate change.
库尔德地区在朝自治的方向前进，而逊尼派受到宗教色彩强烈的、由什叶派主导的威权中央政府的排挤，日渐被边缘化。	Kurdistan has embarked on a path toward increased autonomy, while the Sunnis are increasingly marginalized by a sectarian and authoritarian Shia-dominated central government.
美国发动阿富汗战争以来已导致超过40,000名平民丧生，因为巴基斯坦政府与助其掌权的势力展开了罪恶的合作。	More than 40,000 citizens have been killed since the beginning of the US war in Afghanistan, because Pakistan’s government criminally collaborates with forces that facilitated its rise to power.
博岑（波尔扎诺）的贷款成本是临近的因斯布鲁克的两倍，这是完全不合理的；事实上，如此武断的差异只能破坏竞争，导致经济停滞。	There is no reason why loans in Bozen (Bolzano) should cost twice as much as those in nearby Innsbruck; in fact, such arbitrary divergences merely undermine competition and cause economic stagnation.
这些天来，我一直在想这一挑战。 因为我的新项目HICCup（健康计划协调委员会，Health Initiative Coordinating Council）旨在（部分地）帮助大量的人这样做，尽管一开始该项目的对象只局限在少数社区。	I think about this challenge a lot these days, because my new startup, called HICCup (Health Initiative Coordinating Council), aims (in part) to help people do just that on a massive scale, though initially concentrated in just a few communities.
那些在这一领域的人了解这项技术，其中一些人还会按照商定的标准来设计这项技术；但不能让他们独自去制定这些标准。	Those in the field know the technology and will be the ones to design it according to agreed standards; but they must not decide alone what those standards will be.
包括机器人在内的先进制造技术意味着创造出的少数工作将需要更高的技能，将被安置在那些与流失就业岗位所在地不同的地点。	Advanced manufacturing technology, including robots, means that the few jobs created will require higher skills and will be placed at different locations than the jobs that were lost.
这一思维状态的受益者是反建制候选人，他们力挺反对自由贸易和移民改革，要求彻底改变当前税收和支出政策。	The beneficiaries of this state of mind are anti-establishment candidates who espouse policies in opposition to free trade and immigration reform and who call for a radical overhaul of current tax and spending policies.
比如马尔万·巴尔豪迪这个依然在押的暴力活动领袖就获选为中央委员会的新成员，而中央委员会则是法塔赫的最高执行机构。	A jailed intifada leader, Marwan Barghouti, was among the highest elected new leaders to the central committee, the movement’s executive body.
也许是担心导致更大的社会动荡，因此西西至今仍未满足去年11月国际货币基金组织（IMF）所提出的作为其120亿美元援助计划的一部分的条件。	Perhaps fearing even greater social unrest, Sisi has yet to meet the conditions set last November by the International Monetary Fund as part of a $12 billion bailout.
但为何当选总统比君主更适合刺激关于社会价值和当务之急的公共争论？ 最重要的原因是他更有可能具有出众的能力。	But the most important reason why an elected president is better equipped than a monarch to catalyze a public conversation about a society’s values and priorities is that he or she is more likely to be a person of superior ability.
就业问题甚至可能被进一步利用，发展中国家常见的工作环境差、工资水平低、童工和其它问题也无一例外成了博取支持的武器。	The jobs issue could be exploited further by citing poor working conditions, low wages, child labor, and other problems commonly found in developing countries.
而欧洲当局推迟了重要的难民政策决定，以避免对英国全民公决造成消极影响，从而让加莱等地的乱象持久持续。	And the European authorities delayed important decisions on refugee policy in order to avoid a negative effect on the British referendum vote, thereby perpetuating scenes of chaos like the one in Calais.
从1980年以来，全球能源需求增加了50%以上，而且预计将会从现在起到2030年每年增加1.6 % 。	Worldwide energy demand has increased by more than 50% since 1980, and is expected to grow annually by 1.6% between now and 2030.
泥浆、垃圾和人的排泄物构成了苦难的岩浆，带刺铁丝网和官方的冷漠 — — 欧盟和希腊当局提供的少得可怜的资源就是明证 — — 构成了地狱界。	Mud, refuse, and human excrement formed a magma of misery, a hellscape surrounded by barbed wire and the official indifference reflected in the puny resources provided by the European Union and Greek authorities.
因为在1960年代，包括美国前总统约翰·F·肯尼迪在内许多人都曾经认为到今天世界上将存在数十个拥有核武器的国家，而且这些国家极有可能会动用核武器。	Many people, including President John F. Kennedy, believed in the 1960’s that there would be dozens of countries with nuclear weapons by now, and that their use would be highly probable.
在特朗普就任总统期间和在那之后，上述转移将只会加速，除非为了保住美国来之不易且代价昂贵的全球优势而做出重大的变革。	That shift will only accelerate further during and after Trump’s presidency, unless major changes are made to retain America’s costly, hard-earned global preeminence.
这部现在被引为电视史上收视率最高的纪录片《浩劫后》使得美国总统罗纳德·里根感到“万分沮丧 ” ， 并重新思考自己的核战略。	The Day After, now cited as the highest-rated film in TV history, left then-US President Ronald Reagan “greatly depressed” and caused him to rethink his nuclear strategy.
确实，看起来克里姆林宫的每个人都在阅读纳粹法学家施密特的著作。 施密特教诲说，指出你的敌人是政治的中心使命。	Indeed, it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt, the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics.
如果希腊等国想���保未来几十年国内民众的健康和繁荣，他们就必须想法设法防止当前经济活动进一步加剧本已不可持续的环境债务。	If Greece and other countries are to ensure the health and prosperity of their citizens in the decades to come, they will have to find a way to prevent current economic activity from increasing an already unsustainable burden of environmental debt.
结果，这些国家中的城市被一一铲平，杀害平民的不仅有纳粹，还有入侵波兰为纳粹德国国防军提供西线战争所需物资的苏联军队。	As a result, cities in those countries were flattened and people killed not only by the Nazis, but also by their Soviet ally, which invaded Poland and supplied the Wehrmacht with the material it needed for its war against the West.
我们并不是那么习惯于以促进清洁能源、霍乱疫苗或者帮助非洲贫困农民抵御干旱的作物等新技术来思考全球合作问题。	We are less accustomed to thinking of global cooperation to promote new technologies, such as clean energy, a malaria vaccine, or drought-resistant crops to help poor African farmers.
即使签订了核协议并得到了实施，也不能影响这一现实，反而有可能让形势变得更加糟糕，因为伊朗可能会获得更好的名声，并且其建造核武器的长期选择并未受到影响。	Even a nuclear agreement that is signed and implemented will not affect this reality and might even make it worse, as Iran could well emerge with its reputation enhanced and a long-term option to build nuclear weapons intact.
此外，如 波兰总理塔斯克（Donald Tusk）所提出的，欧盟应该认真思考将能源采购从第三方手中集中过来。	Moreover, the EU should contemplate centralizing the purchase of energy from third parties, as proposed by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.
梅在访问华盛顿时就采用了这种策略，她在特朗普在联合记者会上公开声明支持酷刑时默默站在一边什么都没说。	That is the approach May took on her visit to Washington, DC, when she stood by silently as Trump openly declared his support for the use of torture at their joint press conference.
此外，我们的公务员注重解决问题，表现出一定程度的足智多谋，发明了许多地方化的方案以解决诸如确保食品安全、清洁水和住房的充足供应等人类发展挑战。	Moreover, our civil servants embrace problem solving, demonstrating a level of resourcefulness that has produced many localized solutions to human development challenges such as ensuring food security and adequate supplies of clean water and housing.
到2030年，它希望能够从可再生能源中获取40％的电力供应，最早从2022年开始通过太阳能发电获得100兆瓦的电力。	It hopes to generate 40% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, and it expects 100 gigawatts of that to come from solar energy by as early as 2022.
2008年穆沙拉夫在民众压力下辞职，在随后的新一轮选举中贝纳齐尔·布托（在去年12月死于暗杀）的鳏夫阿西夫·扎尔达里（Asif Zardari）胜出并担任总统职务。	In 2008, Musharraf resigned under popular pressure, and a new election brought Asif Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, who had been assassinated the previous December, to the presidency.
他们认为如倘若欧洲真的想作为全球事务参与者被受到重视的话，就必须在送钱的同时展示一下自己的一身肌肉。	If Europe is to be taken seriously as a global player, they argue, it must also flex some muscle when it delivers the money.
As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.	Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
传统上，低收入国家的债权人是富裕国家政府和多边机构，如果索债意味着借款国必须削减教育和卫生等关键公共服务，就会饱受政治压力。	Traditionally, low-income countries’ creditors were rich-world governments and multilateral organizations that found it politically unfeasible to call in debts if this meant that borrowers had to cut vital public services such as education or health.
发自雅典 — — 当欧元区建立之时，它的缔造者们希望它能逐渐朝着以财政统一，人员自由流动以及政治联盟为特点的“优化货币区 ” 。	ATHENS – When the eurozone was established, its creators envisioned gradual progress toward an “optimal currency area,” characterized by fiscal integration, the free movement of labor, and political union.
更重要的是在过去10年间，铀矿的开采只能满足全世界核能发电燃料总需求量的2/3 — — 2010年度需求量约为6.8万当量吨天然铀。	Furthermore, during the past 10 years, only about two-thirds of worldwide demand for nuclear fuel – about 68,000 tons of natural uranium equivalent are needed for 2010 – was met from resources obtained from mining.
这差不多等于美国与1951年的日本，1967年的新加坡，1975年的台湾，1977年的韩国之间的差距 — — 这四个国家正是发展委员会研究的13个成功的经济体中的4个。	That is roughly the same gap that existed between the US and Japan in 1951, Singapore in 1967, Taiwan in 1975, and South Korea in 1977 – four economies that are also among the 13 successful economies studied by the Growth Commission.
一项针对总统修辞学方面的详细研究也证明即便是富兰克林·罗斯福或者罗纳德·里根这样的著名演说家都无法仅靠个人魅力来推动政策项目。	One careful study of presidential rhetoric found that even such famous orators as Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan could not count on charisma to enact their programs.
欧洲人不应该为了促进贸易而损害他们对隐私的真正关注，因为贸易（有时）只是实现更高生活水平的手段而已。	Europeans should not have to compromise their genuinely held concerns about privacy just to promote trade, which is simply a means (sometimes) to achieving higher living standards.
但是，尽管这并没有实现，但欧洲原则也显然没有失去吸引力，最近乌克兰总统亚努科维奇决定与欧洲决裂的消息引起乌克兰人民示威游行就是明证。	But, while that did not occur, European principles certainly have not lost their allure, as recent protests in Ukraine, triggered by President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to shun closer ties with Europe, have shown.
即使这种错误的激励措施都被避免，为了控制成本, 还有更棘手的问题需要面对。 其中之一就是新药物的花费。	Development costs have to be passed on in drug prices, which may be exceptionally high when a drug benefits only a relatively small number of patients.
据国际货币基金组织（IMF ） ， 2009—2016年世界贸易量年增长平均刚刚超过3 % — —只有1980—2008年期间6%的一半。	According to the International Monetary Fund, annual growth in the volume of world trade has averaged just 3% over the 2009-2016 period – half the 6% rate from 1980 to 2008.
除了美国士兵在监狱内外的暴力之外，伊拉克妇女每天都面临来自武装人员假借宗教和“解放”名义施加的暴力。	In addition to violence by US troops inside and outside of prisons, women in Iraq face daily violence from militants under the guise of religion and “liberation.”
但伊朗的不光彩的遗产 — — 从197年人质危机到如今的干涉叙利亚 — — 不是许多美国决策者可以轻易原谅或忘却的。	But the country’s dark legacy, from the hostage crisis in 1979 to its involvement in Syria today, is not one that many US policymakers will readily forgive or forget.
鉴于法官的同业公会在过去半个世纪以来一直对行政权力之争保持相对独立的姿态，所以这一决定是向更公平的选举迈进了一大步。	This was a major step toward fairer elections, as the judges’ professional union has remained fairly independent over the past half-century of executive power grabs.
官方的统计数字很可能高估了经济增长水平，因为该统计忽略了一些重要事实，即小企业的经营情绪（business sentiment）极其低落，它们的产出仍在急剧下滑。	But official measures of GDP may grossly overstate growth in the economy as they don't capture the fact that business sentiment among small firms is abysmal and their output is still falling sharply.
一些大学成立了委员会，就大学受托人投资组合中的环境、社会和治理（ESG）相关内容提供建议，最常见的情形是要举行支持ESG方案的代理投票时。	Several have committees that advise university trustees on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in their portfolio, most commonly when proxy votes in support of ESG proposals are to be held.
成为真正的全球领袖意味着决定和联结市场赖以运行的全球经济结构 — — 美国承担这一角色已接近70年。	Being a true global leader means shaping and connecting the global economic structures within which states and markets operate – something the US has been doing for almost 70 years.
短期和长期的政策也因此紧密地联系了起来；除非临时应急措施能与根本性的长期结构改革相结合，另一个与目前类似（甚至更加恶劣的）灾难将在劫难逃。	Short-term and long-term policies are therefore closely related; unless temporary stopgaps are combined with fundamental long-term structural reform, another disaster like the current one – or worse – will become inevitable.
公民社会团体、政治党派、联合国甚至一些企业利益集团都强烈反对该立法，因此政府的这一行为是难以理解和宽恕的。	Given strong opposition from civil-society groups, political parties, the United Nations, and even some business interests, the government’s behavior was both understandable and inexcusable.
比如，作为下一个即将面临选举的主要领导人的英国首相托尼·布莱尔大打人格魅力牌并大谈政治事务，但是他代表的毕竟是中层阶级的价值观。	For example, Prime Minister Tony Blair, the next major leader to face an election, plays the personality card and talks about policies, but he represents above all a set of middle-class values.
美国梦正在让位给阶级意识 — — 对于这个建立在人人都能通过努力工作改善生活的理想的国家来说，这是个影响深远的变化。	The American Dream is giving way to class consciousness – a profound change for a country founded on the ideal that anyone can improve his or her lot through hard work.
根据世界银行的统计，彻底消除所有的商品贸易障碍对发展中国家收入的最终推进比例不超过1 % ， 对发达国家收入的影响就更小了。	According to World Bank estimates, complete elimination of all merchandise trade restrictions would ultimately boost developing-country incomes by no more than 1%. The impact on developed-country incomes would be even smaller.
WWF全球总干事詹姆斯·李普（James Leape）解释说，它提供了一个“全球平台，使亿万人可以表达他们对气候变化的灾难性后果的担忧之情 。 ”	As WWF Director-General James Leape explained, it provides “a global platform for millions of people to voice their concern about the devastating effects of climate change.”
此外，能源和食品价格的波动非常剧烈而且基本上不可预测，与此同时，其价格的变化速度也随着这种波动越来越快。	Moreover, energy and food price shocks can be both large and largely unpredictable, while the speed of price changes tends to increase with big shocks.
伦敦 — “ 那个在你手指上的钻石，说一下它是怎么样变成你的 ？ ” 莎士比亚笔下的辛柏林（Cymbeline）问。	LONDON – “That diamond upon your finger, say how came it yours?” asks Shakespeare’s Cymbeline.
比如我的一位亲戚眼睛出了毛病，她的医生将其转给了另一个眼科医生，但眼科医生检查之后认为没必要做手术，于是又把她转回去了原来的医生处。	A member of my family recently had an eye problem, and was referred by her general practitioner to an eye surgeon. The surgeon examined the eye, said that it didn’t need surgery, and sent her back to the general practitioner.
但这一建议不但受到担心国际货币基金组织对问题债务国太友好的债权国的反对，也受到预料到近期信誉可能遭到质疑的新兴市场的反对。	But the proposal faced sharp opposition not only from creditors who feared that the IMF would be too friendly to problem debtors, but also from emerging markets that foresaw no near-term risk to their perceived creditworthiness.
像今年这样的厄尔尼诺相关天气事件（更准确地说应该是“厄尔尼诺南部震荡 ” ） 的影响因为其全球效应而显得尤其巨大。	The impact of El Niño-related weather events like the one this year (known more precisely as “El Niño Southern Oscillation” events) can be especially large because of their global reach.
他未能充分认识到这些战斗人员对土耳其自身安全造成的威胁，尤其当伊斯兰教附属团体的诸多参与者对土耳其怀有的敌意并不逊于阿萨德。	He failed to recognize fully the danger these fighters posed to Turkey’s own security, particularly as many of them joined Islamist-affiliated groups that are as hostile to Turkey as they are to Assad.
这一减税方案应该与经济状况挂钩，随着就业的复苏（比如就业人口占总人口比例恢复到2007年水平时）而降级。	These tax cuts should also be linked to the state of the economy, so that they would wind down as employment recovers (for example, to its level in 2007, relative to total population).
奥巴马总统在亚洲推进了TPP，但知道最近才要求国会授予便宜行事谈判权（即要求国会进行投票表决并且不对方案进行修订 ） 。	President Barack Obama has promoted the TPP in Asia, but he only recently asked Congress for fast-track negotiating authority (the ability to request an up-or-down congressional vote without amendments).
他把他的正义和发展党（Justice and Development Party）发展成了穆斯林世界的欧洲基督民主（Christian Democratic）党，将经济增长、反腐���政策和自由选举相结合。	He presented his Justice and Development Party as the Muslim equivalent of Europe’s Christian Democratic parties, combining economic growth, anti-corruption policies, and free elections.
有122个国家赞成了该条约，但一个国家反对，一个国家弃权，另有69个国家，包括有核国家和北约成员国，没有投票。	Whereas 122 countries voted for it, one voted against, one abstained, and 69, including the nuclear powers and NATO members, did not vote.
一方面，利比亚伊斯兰主义者与埃及穆斯林兄弟会和突尼斯复兴运动党（Ennahda）有一个显著不同 — — 制度化水平和群众互动。	A striking difference between Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood and Tunisia’s Ennahda, on the one hand, and Libya’s Islamists on the other is the level of institutionalization and interaction with the masses.
如果我们不去应对那个自由金融市场可以催生有害杠杆水平的根本现实，就等于没有在2008年危机中汲取最重要的教训。	If we do not address the fundamental fact that free financial markets can generate harmful levels of private-sector leverage, we will not have learned the most important lesson of the 2008 crisis.
这与其他强人的方针形成了鲜明对比。 比如，已故的委内瑞拉领导人查韦斯用漫长的石油繁荣的收入来支撑慷慨的社会福利计划，以此来维持公共支持率。	This contrasts sharply with the approach of, say, Venezuela’s late strongman leader Hugo Chávez, who maintained popular support for 14 years by spending the proceeds of a long oil-price boom on generous social programs.
与NCD相关的身体和经济负担最重的正是那些最容易受影响的国家：中低收入国家占了NCD相关死亡人数的80 % 。	The physical and economic burdens associated with NCDs fall the hardest where they are least easily borne: low- and middle-income countries, where 80% of NCD-related deaths occur.
法国很久以来以让·雅克·卢梭的哲学体系为特色，一直把公意的代表，也就是法律尊奉为最高等级的司法规范。	France has long been characterized by Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s philosophy, which placed the law – the expression of the General Will – at the absolute top of the hierarchy of judicial norms.
简言之，在萨默斯所预言的长期停滞中，低利率是抵消低投资回报的必要条件，而长期停滞的发生很有可能是拜戈登所强调的提振生产率的技术变革发展缓慢所赐。	In short, the secular stagnation that Summers has predicted, with low interest rates being necessary to offset low returns on investment, could well be caused by the slowdown in productivity-enhancing technological change that Gordon highlights.
另一个讽刺之处是，新兴世界所需要的大部分投资项目是长期项目，大量可用储蓄 — — 退休账户、养老基金和主权财富基金拥有数万亿美元 — — 亦然。	There is another irony. Most of the investment projects that the emerging world needs are long term, as are much of the available savings – the trillions in retirement accounts, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds.
欧盟一位高级官员解释其中的含义说 ： “ 在最近一段时间，有很多案例显示要么是巴基斯坦人潜入欧洲，要么是欧盟公民奔赴巴基斯坦参加培训并被洗脑 。 ”	A senior EU official spelled out what this means: there had been “many cases in the recent past where either Pakistanis were coming to Europe or young EU citizens were going to Pakistan for training and being brainwashed.”
但他们确实发现了阿族目击者指称科索沃解放军将被俘的塞尔维亚人、阿尔巴尼亚人和罗马人带到阿尔巴尼亚，并在阿境内将他们杀害。	They did, however, find Albanian witnesses who asserted that UCK members took captured Serbs, Albanians, and Roma into Albania, where they were killed.
我本人是五零后，我感到羞愧和懊恼的是，我担心我们这代人在发达经济体将作为丧失经济主动权的一代被载入史册。	I am in my late fifties, and I worry that our generation in the advanced world will be remembered – to our shame and chagrin – as the one that lost the economic plot.
如果美国的目的是给伊朗放风 — — “当心，没准你就是下个目标 ” — —那么很多人会质疑美国是否真的想约束以色列。	If America’s purpose is to deliver a message to Iran – “Beware, you could be the next target” – many will question its sincerity about restraining Israel.
正如2015年国际货币基金组织《世界经济展望》报告所显示的那样，尽管某些国家可能处于全球价值链上游，但汇率对出口增长仍然很重要。	As the 2015 IMF World Economic Outlook report shows, despite the rise of global value chains, the exchange rate still matters for export growth.
投资者-国家纠纷解决（ISDS）条款允许外国投资者在新监管规则降低了他们的预期未来利润时追求有法律约束力的针对政府的仲裁。	Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions allow foreign investors to pursue binding private arbitration against governments if new regulations reduce their expected future profits.
20世纪70年代，印度取消了药品专利，逐步形成了能为发展中国家民众提供平价药品的先进、高效的仿制药行业。	In the 1970s, India abolished pharmaceutical patents, creating an advanced and efficient generics industry capable of providing affordable medicines to people throughout the developing world.
由于负面财富效应以及不确定性增加，10月份消费支出大幅下降，但随后又迅速回稳，投资支出基本保持不变。	Consumer spending dropped sharply in October, owing to negative wealth effects and heightened uncertainty, but it quickly stabilized and recovered, while investment spending remained essentially unchanged.
集体诉讼条款可以强制执行大部分债权人接受的条件，已经成为主权债务的标准条款，但2001年危机爆发之前所发行的阿根廷债务并不包含此项条款。	These clauses became standard in sovereign bonds but were missing in those issued by Argentina before 2001, when the crisis hit.
现在，制宪会议中几乎1/3的成员是妇女 — — 这一比例在南亚是最高的，在世界各国由全国选民选举的机构中排名14。	Now nearly one-third of the Constituent Assembly’s members are women – the highest proportion in South Asia and fourteenth place in the world for nationally elected bodies.
新抗癌药物或更快速的计算机这样的创新应该惠及全人类 — — 而不仅仅是幸运地生在实现这些发现的国家的人。	Innovations like new cancer drugs or faster computing should benefit people everywhere – not only those fortunate enough to live in the country where the discoveries happen to have been developed.
这是一个需要考虑的重要问题，因为人们相对来说较少关注一个紧密相关、同样重要的人类生存威胁：令人吃惊的全球生物多样性丧失速度。	That is an important question to consider, in view of the relative lack of attention devoted to a closely related and equally important threat to human survival: the startling pace of global biodiversity loss.
大约就是在1948年到1973年这一阶段，社会学家们开始发现，大部分美国人开始将自己定位为中产阶级而不是工人阶级了。	It was during this era – roughly from 1948 to 1973 – that sociologists found that a majority of Americans had come to define themselves not as working class, but as middle class.
面对主要来自中东和非洲地区的持续移民和难民涌入，欧洲选民已经将近期一系列选举转化成了有关移民问题的公投行动。	Faced with a sustained influx of refugees and migrants, primarily from the Middle East and Africa, European voters have transformed a series of recent elections into popular referenda on immigration.
受夏洛特维尔事件的刺激，英国也出现了一批人想要将著名的伦敦特拉法加广场的纳尔逊将军雕像移除，因为这位英国海军英雄支持奴隶贸易。	Inspired by the events taking place in Charlottesville, advocates have emerged in Britain seeking to pull Admiral Nelson off his famous column on Trafalgar Square in London, because the British naval hero supported the slave trade.
正如卡门·莱因哈特与肯尼思·罗格夫最近发表的一篇国际货币基金组织论文所指出的那样，那些发达经济都面临着一些无法仅仅借助一系列紧缩，拖延和增长就能消除的债务负担。	As a recent IMF paper by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff illustrates, advanced economies face debt burdens that cannot be reduced simply through a mix of austerity, forbearance, and growth.
柏林 — — 2001年9月11日的“基地”组织恐怖袭击后美国已发动对“基地”组织、阿富汗和伊拉克的三次战争。	BERLIN – The United States has waged three wars since Al Qaeda’s terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001: against Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan, and in Iraq.
有些人希望高级军备贸易也能在这一新型合作中有所体现 — — 这一观点最近正在推动欧盟解除对华实施长达15年的军售禁令。	Some want that partnership to include trade in advanced weaponry—witness the recent push to remove the EU’s 15-year-old ban on arms sales to China.
复苏赢得了动力（特别是在一些发达经济体 ） ， 但世界经济仍然没有达到马力全开的状态 — — 未来几年可能将依然处于动力不足的状态。	While recovery gained momentum, particularly in some advanced economies, the world economy is not yet flying on all engines – and is likely to remain underpowered next year as well.
包括古斯塔夫·克虏伯（Gustav Krupp ） 、 弗雷德里希·弗里克（Friedrich Flick ） 、 弗里茨·冯·欧宝（Fritz von Opel）在内的20多位德国顶级产业家听取了希特勒的演讲，他承诺他们的资产可以在他的统治下保全。	More than 20 of Germany’s top industrialists, including Gustav Krupp, Friedrich Flick, and Fritz von Opel, listened to a speech by Hitler, who promised them that their assets would be safe under his rule.
其一是中国主席习近平提出的“修西得底斯陷阱 ” ， 指的是古希腊历史学家修西得底斯警告如果一个现有大国（如美国）太过恐惧一个正在崛起的大国（如中国 ） ， 那就有可能爆发灾难性的战争。	The “Thucydides Trap,” cited by Chinese President Xi Jinping, refers to the warning by the ancient Greek historian that cataclysmic war can erupt if an established power (like the United States) becomes too fearful of a rising power (like China).
首先，危机爆发时，时任IMF总裁斯特劳斯-卡恩（Dominique Strauss-Kahn）在法国总统选举中领先。	For starters, at the onset of the crisis, then-IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn was a leading candidate to become President of France.
但时间是最重要的因素；外交手段需要加快进程，否则就会被伊朗核武器发展进度赶上，果真如此，西方真得面临冲突了。	But time is of the essence; diplomacy needs to move faster if it is not to be overtaken by Iran’s march to a nuclear weapon – and, with it, the march to conflict.
与此同时，全国人本发展计划（National Initiative for Human Development）帮助摩洛哥最脆弱公民群体（特别是女性）摆脱贫困、融入社会。	Meanwhile, a new National Initiative for Human Development is helping to end poverty and social exclusion among Morocco’s most vulnerable citizens, especially women.
对于军政府的将军们来说，这一点使得他们的退却痛苦得犹如伤口上撒盐。 因为此前，东盟一直是缅甸抵御国际社会压力的最坚实的挡箭牌之一。	This must have made the retreat doubly painful for the generals, as ASEAN was previously one of the junta’s strongest shields against international pressure.
英国臭鼬大麻的HTC水平较高，而几乎不含CBD；另一方面，hash大麻的HTC和CBD含量基本相同。	Skunk in the UK has high levels of THC while being virtually devoid of CBD; hash, on the other hand, has roughly equal quantities of the two components.
不幸的是，到目前为止，欧盟国家针对民粹主义威胁作出了与20世纪30年代以邻为壑的保护主义政策相类似的回应，每个国家都试图将问题推给其他国家，直到最终所有国家面对问题都无法继续逃避。	Unfortunately, the response to populist gains so far has been similar to the beggar-thy-neighbor response to protectionism in the 1930s, with each country trying to shift the problem on to others until it comes back to bite everyone.
尽管房地产投资的大幅下降会给中国的经济增长带来严重负面影响 — — 这一点可以也应该预防 — — 但只要跌幅不是太猛，对中国就是利大于弊的。	Although a significant decline in real-estate investment will have a very serious negative impact on China’s growth – which can and should be prevented – as long as the fall is not too drastic, it is a welcome development.
以色列阿拉伯人将被要求将国籍、国民身份和投票权 — — 但不包括敌据点 — — 转换至新的巴勒斯坦国。	Israeli Arabs would then be required to transfer their citizenship, national identity, and national voting rights – but not their residence – to the new Palestinian state.
而美国的贸易伙伴们自然会对这一强加的关税实施报复 — — 这正是今年早些时候实施钢铁和铝关税之后发生的事情。	There would naturally be retaliation in the form of higher tariffs imposed by America’s trading partners, which is exactly what happened after the steel and aluminum tariffs were imposed earlier this year.
而在法国，一个大胆出格的说法就是除非恢复其货币主权，否则就将陷入比以往任何时候都更深层次的经济萎缩之中。	In France, the idea that now dares to speak its name is that the country will sink into an ever-deeper economic malaise unless it regains its monetary sovereignty.
我担心这意味着过早地从消费者拉动模式回到中国的舒适区 — — 长期以来更加顺从于中央计划的产业工程的生产者模式。	I worry that it could indicate a premature shift away from the consumer-led model back to China’s comfort zone of a producer model that has long been more amenable to the industrial engineering of central planning.
其说辞 — — 至少从一方看 — — 类似于丘吉尔1946年的《铁幕》演说。 丘吉尔的这次演说是冷战拉开序幕的标志性事件之一。	And the rhetoric – at least from one side – has come to resemble that of Winston Churchill’s 1946 “Iron Curtain” speech, one of the inaugural events of the Cold War.
正如前总理唐纳德·图斯克在推特上所评论的那样 ： “ 那些散布‘波兰死亡集中营’这个伪词汇的人正在损害波兰的良好声誉和利益。	As former Prime Minister Donald Tusk commented on Twitter: “Whoever spreads the false phrase ‘Polish death camps’ is harming Poland’s good name and its interests.
根据国际妇女研究中心和世界银行的数据，终结童婚可以节省出数十亿美元的年度福利开支，到2030年时总共为全球节省超过4万亿美元。	According to the International Center for Research on Women and the World Bank, ending the practice of child marriage would save billions of dollars in annual welfare expenditures, resulting in global savings of more than $4 trillion by 2030.
比如，在中东，身份政治正在以最邪恶的形式展现：逊尼派和什叶派之间的混乱而暴力的冲突，伊斯兰国的崛起就是明证。	In the Middle East, for example, identity politics is manifesting itself in its most sinister form: a chaotic and violent clash between Sunni and Shia Muslims, exemplified by the rise of the Islamic State.
今年晚些时候，IMF将重新制定其账户单位 — — 由目前包括美国、欧元、英镑和日元的一揽子货币所组成的所谓的特别提款权的权重。	Later this year, the IMF will recalibrate the weights in its unit of account, the so-called Special Drawing Rights, which comprises a basket of currencies that currently includes the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen.
拜所有这些因素所赐，赢家和输家的平衡变得更加极端和难以管理，不仅经济上是如此，政治和社会上也是如此。	As a result of all of this, the balance of winners and losers has become increasingly extreme and more difficult to manage, not just economically, but also politically and socially.
尽管我十分希望他们最终能被证明是正确的，但最新的疲软经济数字（包括5月就业岗位净增量仅仅69000个）确认了我的怀疑。	While I hoped that they might be proven right, the recent stream of weak economic data, including May’s timid net job creation of only 69,000, confirmed my doubts.
尽管如此，中国人民银行的战术性决定也存在潜在漏洞，因为这鼓励了信用规模扩张，而中国正在竭力摆脱债务密集型增长。	Nonetheless, the PBOC’s tactical decision is not without potential pitfalls – not least because interest-rate cuts encourage the extension of more credit at a time when China is trying to wean itself from debt-intensive growth.
当面临这个挑战时，其过程很有可能是局部且不平衡的，它会突显出一些差异性，并在国家、地区及全球层面上产生棘手的协调问题。	And, when it is met, the process will most likely be partial and uneven, accentuating differences and posing tricky coordination issues at the national, regional, and global levels.
由于三分之一的选民认为他胜之不武，再加上墨西哥法治目前的微妙处境，卡尔德龙所处的地位就更加不值得羡慕。	Given that roughly a third of the electorate does not think he won fairly, and in view of the precariousness of the rule of law in the country, Calderón’s position is even less enviable.
最近中国获得斯里兰卡汉班托塔港99年的租赁权，而按照纳希德的说法，中国还从债务深重的马尔代夫手中收购了17 个岛礁用作投资用途。	Just as China recently secured the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota on a 99-year lease, it has, according to Nasheed, quietly acquired 17 islands in the heavily indebted Maldives for investment purposes.
毕竟，在核惩罚因太过严厉而缺乏可信度的情况下，美国采取了常规的灵活策略，在遏制苏联入侵西欧的行动中加入了防卫的元素。	After all, when nuclear punishment seemed too draconian to be credible, the US adopted a conventional flexible response to add an element of denial in its effort to deter a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.
政府还应当拨出充足的国内资金实现上述目标，比方说非洲国家首脑切实履行2001年阿布贾宣言承诺，拿出国家预算的至少15%投资公共卫生部门。	Governments would also be expected to allocate adequate domestic funds to achieve these goals, with, for example, African heads of state fulfilling the 2001 Abuja Declaration’s pledge to allocate at least 15% of national budgets to the health sector.
对欧洲银行来说 — — 它们在追求跨境兼并时必须面对巨大的文化、语言和法律差异 — — 这要困难得多，特别是因为它们中有许多还需要大量削减过剩产能。	For European banks – which must navigate vast differences in culture, language, and law in pursuing cross-border mergers – this has been much more difficult, especially because many of them also need to cut overcapacity drastically.
本月早些时候，IMF、世界银行和世界贸易组织发布了一份联合报告，报告称赞贸易是生产率增长、竞争和消费选择的推进器。	Earlier this month, the IMF, World Bank, and World Trade Organization published a joint report extolling the benefits of trade as a driver of productivity growth, competition, and consumer choice.
武装英美干预，特别是在没有获得联合国批准的情况下，会破坏自由及民主人士的可信性，而他们需要不惜一切代价取得信任。	Armed Anglo-American intervention, especially if it is not sanctioned by the United Nations, would do much to undermine liberals and democrats, who need all the credibility they can get.
美国真正的问题并不是被中国或其他竞争对手所超越，而是众多其他参与者（包括国家和非国家行为主体）权力资源的增加将阻碍全球治理的最新举措。	The real problem for the US is not that it will be overtaken by China or another contender, but that a rise in the power resources of many others – both states and non-state actors – will pose new obstacles to global governance.
这可以通过结束中央情报局-沙特合作推翻巴沙尔·阿萨德的行动实现，从而让阿萨德（在俄罗斯和伊朗的支持下）打败伊斯兰国、稳定叙利亚（并在相邻的伊拉克采取类似方针 ） 。	This can be accomplished by ending the CIA-Saudi alliance to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, thereby enabling Assad (with Russian and Iranian backing) to defeat the Islamic State and stabilize Syria (with a similar approach in neighboring Iraq).
利马集团（Lima Group）的12个拉美成员国，美国，加拿大，欧盟等国家和地区都应该拒绝向这类人发放签证和提供本国公司提供的服务。	The 12-member Lima Group of Latin American countries, the US, Canada, the European Union, and others, should deny visas and access to services provided by national companies.
或者它们可以有助于监督脸谱（Facebook）和谷歌等外国科技巨头进入中国市场，确保这些外国公司可以带来良性竞争及优质服务但不会完全垄断中国市场 。	Or they might help to guide the entry of foreign tech giants like Facebook and Google into the Chinese market, to ensure that those companies do not become too dominant.
比如，伊斯兰历史上曾允许某种形式的一夫多妻制，但是没有哪个自由社会会愿意把宗教的自由延伸到损害其对性别平等的承诺的范畴。	Islam, for example, has historically permitted certain forms of polygamy, but no liberal society is obliged to extend religious freedom in ways that undermine its commitment to gender equality.
上升的防务支出和布什减税政策一起，使得美国财政从布什当选时的2%GDP盈余相当于一路恶化到如今赤字和债务水平岌岌可危的程度。	Increased defense spending, together with the Bush tax cuts, is a key reason why America went from a fiscal surplus of 2% of GDP when Bush was elected to its parlous deficit and debt position today.
认为“转基因”是一种有意义的（也是危险的）的分类不但导致了对田间实验的破坏，也导致了对实验室的破坏和对研究者的人身伤害。	The assumption that “genetically engineered” or “genetically modified” is a meaningful – and dangerous – classification has led not only to vandalism of field trials, but also to destruction of laboratories and assaults on researchers.
阿富汗是一个重要的例子，巴基斯坦没能和印度解决克什米尔纠纷也是一个，这两个失败都加强了国内恐怖团体的力量。	Afghanistan is a prime example, as is the failure to settle the Kashmir imbroglio with India. Both failures have strengthened domestic terrorist groups.
任何曾经参加过竞选的人都曾听到过选民那种熟悉的疑虑 ： “ 我们只在选举的时候才能看到你们政治家 。 ”	Anyone who has ever campaigned for office has heard voters’ familiar refrain: “We only see you politicians at election time.”
除非有灾难性的事件发生 — — 例如流星撞击地球，世界大战或是瘟疫的流行 — — 人类将在接下来的很长一段时间都是影响环境的主要力量。	Unless there is a global catastrophe – a meteorite impact, a world war, or a pandemic – mankind will remain a major environmental force for many millennia.
即便随着经济的发展各方面的条件得到改善，但是随着气候变化造成越来越严重的影响，减少碳排放从长期来看还是变得越来越重要。	Even as development improves conditions, however, reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe.
截止2012年，农业增加值年增长率最高的非洲国家包括布基纳法索、埃塞俄比亚、尼日利亚、马里、莫桑比克、卢旺达和坦桑尼亚。	As of 2012, the African countries with the highest agricultural value-added in terms of annual growth included Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania.
他们将战斗、牺牲、获胜并消灭纳粹主宰欧亚大陆（哪怕继续主宰一年）的希望，让希特勒建立千年帝国的大梦毁灭。	They would fight, die, win, and thus destroy the Nazi hope of dominating Eurasia for even one more year – let alone of establishing Hitler’s 1,000-year Reich.
但旅游业的蓬勃发展并不是注定的 — — 尤其因为激进伊斯兰教的重新崛起，这将导致北非有可能在未来面对恐怖袭击。	But a flourishing tourism sector is not in the cards – not least because of the resurgence of militant Islamism, which will leave North Africa exposed to the risk of terror attacks for years to come.
这一误解被称为“货币错觉 ” ， 也就是相信，货币的名义单位是价值的最佳衡量标准，即使实际价值并不稳定。	The error is called the “money illusion ” – the belief that a nominal unit of currency is the best measure of value, even though its real value is unstable.
到那天傍晚，在威斯康辛州举行的一次集会上，特朗普就开始取笑自己“试图变得和善”的行为，并称媒体应对此次暴力行为负责。	By that evening, at a rally in Wisconsin, he was making fun of his “trying to be nice” act and blamed the media for the violence.
但越来越多的基金会 — — 如比尔和梅琳达•盖茨基金会、洛克菲勒基金会, 和 克雷斯基基金会（Kresge Foundation ） — —正在提高用于扩大慈善的投资的比例。	But a growing number of foundations – such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Kresge Foundation – are increasing the share of assets they direct toward investments that further their philanthropy.
世界银行集团2015/2016 全球监测报告（Global Monitoring Report）强调，各国的政策应对措施的不同导致人口趋势对人口福利的影响大相径庭。	As the World Bank Group’s 2015/2016 Global Monitoring Report emphasized, countries’ policy responses make all the difference in how demographic trends affect the wellbeing of the population.
与此同时，印度必须与中国、俄罗斯和美国就巴基斯坦、阿富汗和中亚国家圣战主义大爆发的问题达成战略谅解。	At the same time, India must develop a strategic understanding with China, Russia, and the US concerning the jihadist explosion in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Central Asian countries.
政策制定者经常试图去阻止变革发生，却不知阻止变革虽然可以保护现有行业和就业岗位，却也极大阻碍了投资并最终伤害了增长和就业。	Too often, policymakers want to prevent change from occurring at all. But while blocking change can protect existing industries and jobs for a while, doing so dramatically deters investment, and eventually hurts growth and employment.
从十九世纪初以来，主要的国际货币都一直都是由是处于民主政治体制下的国家发行，而在这些国家官方是不能任意行动的，债权人的权利也因此得到良好的保障。	Since the early nineteenth century, the leading international currencies have been those of countries with democratic political systems, where arbitrary official action is constrained and creditors are well represented.
让我最担心的是，十年前，这种意识形态是基地组织撼动世界所需要的唯一凭借，哪怕他们需要在阿富汗的原始山洞中完成这一“壮举 ” 。	What most worries me is that a decade ago, such an ideology was all that Al Qaeda needed to destabilize the world, even from a primitive base in the caves of Afghanistan.
在我的政府开始执政的一年中，辞职思维让位给了无限可能思维 — — 具有代表性的例子便是东京赢得2020年夏季奥运会和残奥会举办权。	In the year since my government took office, a mindset of resignation has given way to one of limitless possibility – a shift symbolized for many by Tokyo’s winning bid for the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
我们很容易把非洲大陆罕见的成功案例¾博茨瓦纳和毛里求斯¾归结为外国对其出口产品的需求（两者分别是钻石和成衣 ） ， 但其神话恐怕也仅限于此。	It is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes – Botswana and Mauritius – to foreign demand for their exports (diamonds and garments, respectively), but that story goes only so far.
此外，这一协会提案进一步激发了主要金融中心之间的串通行为：只有那些在一组有限的司法管辖区拥有债券的债券人才可以决定是否推行集体行动条款。	Moreover, the ICMA’s proposal promotes collusive behavior among the major financial centers: The only creditors whose votes would count for the activation of CACs would be those who owned bonds issued under a restricted set of jurisdictions.
可以确认的是，在以色列撤离之后加沙出现的混乱景象和巴勒斯坦权力当局在我们眼前的崩溃使得人们更为真切地感受到了沙龙退出政坛以后留下的真空。	What is certain is that the vacuum left by Sharon’s departure from politics is all the more striking in view of the images of chaos emerging from the Gaza that Israel has vacated, and the collapse of the Palestinian authority before our eyes.
同样，长期以来一直谴责“超自由主义”的英国哲学家约翰·格雷（John Grey）试图将英国脱欧投票 — — 某种明显的本土主义和仇外心理的爆发 — — 归咎于其上。	Similarly, the British philosopher John Gray, who has long decried “hyper-liberalism,” has attempted to turn the Brexit vote – a clear outburst of nativism and xenophobia – on its head.
但这些话只说对了一半，因为研究同样也证明超速驾车造成了大量伤亡，因此把限速指标下降到蜗牛那样就最好了。	But this misses half the story. We could just as well point out that since science tells us that speeding cars kill many people, we should cut speed limits to almost nothing.
但每当新的中东危机爆发时 — — 最新的例子是伊斯兰国的狂飙突进 — — 美国就会再次干预，或者是改变政府（如刚刚在伊拉克所导演的 ） ， 或者是发动新一轮轰炸袭击。	Yet whenever a new Middle East crisis erupts, the latest being triggered by the Islamic State’s recent gains, the US intervenes again, perhaps to change a government (as it has just orchestrated in Iraq) or to launch a new bombing assault.
中国特别希望通过打造绿色和高效的城市群来提高市民的受教育程度、生产力、收入水平等，以创造可持续的消费。	Specifically, China hopes to create green and efficient urban clusters populated by increasingly educated workers who can consume in a sustainable manner.
抗议者中还包括许多年轻人，他们不仅对养老金改革感到愤怒，这在很长一段时间内还不会影响到他们，普京政权在更大范围内的失败更令他们无法接受。	Protesters included many young people, who are angry not just about the pension reform, which will not affect them for a long time, but about the Putin regime’s wider failings.
2010年1月，就在华尔街又一次大发奖金之后，马萨诸塞州针对已故参议员泰德·肯尼迪（Ted Kennedy）的参议院席位举行了一次特别选举，共和党人斯科特·布朗（Scott Brown）夺得该席位。	In January 2010, Massachusetts held a special election for the late Ted Kennedy’s Senate seat, just after Wall Street paid extravagant bonuses, and elected the Republican Scott Brown.
如果没有根本性社会变革，其短期目标极难实现；而即使这些目标实现了，从中期看也未必充分，长期就更不用说了。	Not only would its short-term goals be extremely difficult to achieve without more fundamental societal changes; even if they were attained, they would probably prove inadequate in the medium term, and certainly in the long term.
再往深里看，民粹主义者掌权的时期是潜在不稳定性的表象。 这种不稳定既不利于国家进步，也无益于国际秩序。	Beyond that, populist episodes are signs of an underlying instability that neither serves national progress nor contributes to international order.
但是，这类报道辨别可能影响多年后的政治日程和公共生活的问题，并把它们曝光于天下，其影响可能十分巨大。	Yet, by identifying and bringing to the fore issues that may influence political agendas and public life for years to come, the impact of such reporting can be enormous.
而同期举行的合作政策会议则聚集了全球的学者和艺术家，共同探讨文化习俗和公共政策的关系并提出文化外交的新方向。	A companion policy conference has attracted scholars and artists from around the world exploring the relationship between cultural practice and public policy and suggesting new directions for cultural diplomacy.
确实，在许多情况下，CEO — — 通常是华尔街认可的“超级明星”空降下来“进行彻底的整合 ” — —现在就是公司，尽管其对公司的产品、客户和竞争对手知之甚少。	Indeed, in many cases, the CEO – frequently a Wall Street-endorsed “superstar” parachuted in to “shake things up” – now is the company, despite having little knowledge of its products, customers, and competitors.
新兴经济体对布雷顿森林制度的信任正在加快流失，这一问题在发达国家陷入低增长和持续经济疲软的当下特别严重。	The accelerating erosion of emerging economies’ trust in the Bretton Woods institutions is particularly problematic now, given slow growth and continued economic weakness in advanced countries.
但当轮到美国出手的时候，美国最大限度仅能减免埃及一亿美元债务，提供一亿美元贷款担保以及对私人投资的更多保险保障。	Yet when it came to US action, the most that the US could offer financially was slight debt relief for Egypt ($1 billion), scant loan guarantees ($1 billion), and some insurance coverage for private investments.
对于央行角色也没有一致意见：大约三分之一的国家，央行是主要监管者；三分之一的国家央行只负责银行；还有三分之一的国家央行只是系统监督者。	There is no consensus on the role of the central bank: in around a third of countries, it is the dominant player, in another third it has responsibilities for banks only, while in the remaining third it is a system overseer only.
到了1975年，当时毛泽东依然在世，文化大革命的怒潮也尚未平息，而阶级斗争理论则依然吃香，整个中国既没有私人汽车，商店，也没有商业广告和私有财产，但我却终于来到了北京。	But in 1975, while Mao still lived, the Cultural Revolution still raged, class politics still held sway, and there were no private cars, shops, advertisements, or private property, I arrived in Beijing.
像普里莫·列维和凯尔泰斯·伊姆雷（还有多少其他人？ ）一样，他们瘦弱的身躯背负着600万犹太人的灵魂，要把他们几乎令人难以觉察的存在写进伟大的死亡之书中。	He shares with Primo Levi and Imre Kertész – how many others? – the terrible privilege of having felt six million shadows pressing against his frail silhouette, in an effort to gain their almost imperceptible place in the great book of the dead.
莫内和舒曼指出，一个类似于美国的政治联盟能够避免导致三场欧洲大战的冲突，这一观点着实诱人，但却忽略了可怕的美国南北战争。	Monnet and Schuman argued that a political union similar to America’s would prevent the types of conflict that had caused three major European wars – an appealing idea, but one that overlooked America’s horrific Civil War.
比方说在埃及，默罕默德·穆尔西总统政府将民主制度理解为赢家通吃的方案 — — 并因此在执政一年多后被推翻。	In Egypt, for example, President Mohamed Morsi’s government treated democracy as a winner-take-all proposition – and was ousted after little more than a year.
这样做可能不会带来任何好处；他们指出，这也许可以救几条人命，但叙利亚有如此多的不同国家通过如此多的相互敌对的集团开展着代理战争，因此安全区不可能改变冲突的整体动态。	And perhaps it would do no good; it might save a few lives, they argue, but, with so many different countries fighting a proxy war via so many different groups of opposition fighters, it would not change the overall dynamic of the conflict.
尼罗河三角洲—在埃及解放广场，也就是2011年埃及骚乱的震中以北大约60英里的地方，有一所被学生们称为“监狱”的中学。	NILE DELTA – About 60 miles north of Cairo’s Tahrir Square – the epicenter of the Egyptian uprising in 2011 – there is a secondary school students call “the prison.”
直到20世纪70年代末，新上任的美联储主席保罗·沃尔克（Paul Walker）才开始收紧货币政策，使通胀下降。	It was only at the end of the 1970’s that the Fed, under its new chairman, Paul Volcker, tightened monetary policy and caused inflation to fall.
反过来，加纳医疗服务局、卫生部、国家医疗保险局（National Health Insurance Authority）和通讯部扩大了试点项目，并将远程医学纳入了卫生部的全国电子医疗战略。	In turn, the Ghana Health Service, the Ministry of Health, the National Health Insurance Authority, and the Ministry of Communications expanded the pilot program, and built telemedicine into the Ministry of Health’s national e-health strategy.
拉古娜海滩—在最近的中东之旅中，我震惊于国与国之间差距的增加 — — 夸张到什么程度呢？ 离开时，我相信如今谈论作为整体的地区团结已经毫无意义。	LAGUNA BEACH – During a recent trip to the Middle East, I was struck by the growing gap between countries – so much so that, more than ever, I came away convinced that it makes no sense today to talk of the region as a coherent whole.
在美国，共和党总统候选人唐纳德·特朗普承诺要对中国实施贸易关税、在美墨边境建造一道隔离墙，并禁止穆斯林进入美国。	In the United States, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has promised to impose trade tariffs on China, build a wall on the border with Mexico, and bar Muslims from entering the country.
结果导致拉美各地组建游击队，宗旨是推翻军事独裁政权并实现民主、自由和政策改革 — — 他们坚信无法通过和平手段实现这些目标。	As a result, throughout Latin America, guerrilla groups emerged, seeking to destabilize military dictatorships and attain democracy, freedom, and policy reform – goals that they believed could not be achieved peacefully.
在新经济对传统经济具有大规模冲击力的时代，在突破性技术进步、人口老化和气候变化等因素相互作用的环境下，这一点尤其重要。	This is all the more true at a time of large-scale disruptions, owing to rapid technological progress, demographic shifts, and climate change.
美国纳税人因此必须在未来30年内为这笔增加的债务付出每年20亿美元的真是利息，然后偿付2000亿美元本金或将债务展期。	American taxpayers would then have to pay $2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years, and then pay off or roll over the entire $200 billion.
尽管有很多关于中国将来会转向内需导向的说法，中国现在依然严重依赖出口和外部需求 — — 这是其经济增长的主要动力。	Despite all the talk about the coming shift to internal demand, China remains heavily dependent on exports and external demand as major drivers of economic growth.
如果我们能弄明白这一过程，就能治疗许多恶疾，既包括神经疾病（如帕金森病和老年痴呆症 ） ， 也包括衰退性疾病（包括癌症等与年纪相关的疾病 ） 。	If it were understood, it could lead to cures for many crippling diseases, both neurological (like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s) and degenerative (including those, like cancer, associated with aging).
由于规避风险的行为，投资者的去杠杆化以及更严格银行监管的综合影响，2年和5年期美国回购利率一直会被定期推入负值区域。	Both the two-year and five-year US repo rates have been pushed periodically into negative territory, owing to the combined effects of risk-averse behavior, investor deleveraging, and stricter banking regulation.
因此，他们的后继者，中华人民共和国主席习近平及其台湾同道马英九最近在新加坡的碰面称为历史性可谓实至名归。	So the recent meeting in Singapore between their heirs, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic and his Taiwanese counterpart, Ma Ying-jeou, could legitimately be described as historic.
每个月，我们都要确保卫生工作者完成“最后一英里 ” ， 将疫苗和其他卫生服务送到边远农村的母亲和儿童手中。	And once a month, we make sure that health workers deliver vaccines and other health services “the last mile” to mothers and children in remote rural areas.
恰恰相反，由于锁定了专利所有者的优势并推升了新技术成本，这样的保护往往会减少后续的创新数量、延缓专利扩散并提高市场集中度。	On the contrary, because they lock in incumbents’ advantages and drive up the costs of new technology, such protections are associated with less new or follow-on innovation, weaker diffusion, and increased market concentration.
这意味着除非政府支出能够搭起需求的桥梁，该经济体的大型非贸易部门就不能驱动经济增长也不会创造新的工作机会。	This means that, unless government spending provides the demand bridge, the large non-tradable part of the economy cannot drive growth and job creation.
他认为，只要你不是疯子，就不会渴望比凯恩斯得到的还要多的必需品、改善品和奢侈品，因此，经济问题是可以解决的。	And, because he imagined that no sane person could want more of the necessities, conveniences, and luxuries of life than a Keynes had, the economic problem would be solved.
因此，考察特朗普最近的税收方案十分重要，他的方案四个首要方面 — — 并且全部可以归结为为富人减税。	This is why it is important to examine Trump’s recent tax proposal, which has four salient features – all of which amount to tax cuts for the rich.
但2008年9月全球各大银行（以及保险公司和共同基金）破产和濒临破产的浪潮则表明这种看法是大错特错的。	In September 2008, the wave of failures and near-failures at global banks (and insurance companies and mutual funds) demonstrated that this view was deeply mistaken.
一个潜在竞争者或许想去进入这一市场，但考虑到大量的规则性准入壁垒，它可能最终还是决定留在原来所在的行业。	A potential competitor might consider entering that market; but, given substantial regulatory entry barriers, it might ultimately decide to remain in its current business.
在上西区由中央公园、林肯中心和哈得逊河构成的三角形区域中心，我曾经习惯于每天清晨以一种奇异的献身方式和谦卑的礼仪开始一天的生活。	Here on the Upper West Side, in the middle of a triangle formed by Central Park, Lincoln Center, and the Hudson River, I was once in the habit of beginning each day with an exotic act of devotion, a ritual of humility.
"当小孙孙问起20世纪初移民美国的俄国妇女，他们的祖先是不是和朝圣者一起坐着""五月花""号轮船到达美国时，她回答说 ： "" 不是，我们的船有个不一样的名字，但我们现在都是美国人 。 """	"""No,"" the Russian woman who came to the US in the early twentieth century replied to the grandchild who asked whether her ancestors arrived with the Pilgrims on the Mayflower. ""Our ship had a different name, but now we are all Americans."""
令一名重要的共和党人麦凯恩参议院尽管经常与布什意见相左，还表达对平民死亡的遗憾，但是补充说 ： “ 我不能告诉你我们不会再这样做了 。 ”	Senator John McCain, another leading Republican, though one often ready to disagree with Bush, expressed regret for the civilian deaths, but added, “I can’t tell you that we wouldn’t do the same thing again.”
唯一的乐观音符是有人评论达沃斯的一致预测几乎总是错误的，所以也许这次的预测可能会被证明是过于悲观了。	The only upbeat note was struck by someone who remarked that Davos consensus forecasts are almost always wrong, so perhaps this time it would prove excessively pessimistic.
与其他外科领域一样，手术过程干预肢体越少，对病人生活质量的副作用就越小，病人恢复正常活动所需的时间也越短。	As in any other surgical field, the less the procedure interferes with the body, the less likely it is to affect the patient’s quality of life adversely, and the sooner the patient will be able to return to normal activity.
2004年白俄罗斯议会选举观察团的最终报告明确指出，投票数“大大低于欧洲安全与合作组织的规定 。 ”	As the Final Report of its 2004 mission to observe the Belarusian parliamentary elections clearly stated, the vote “fell significantly short of OSCE commitments.”
确保研究和开发成为世界应对气候变化的组合应对方式的一部分将使减弱气候变化的影响的努力变得更加有效，并且能够大大增强其在下一世纪减少碳排放的能力。	Ensuring that research and development is part of the world’s climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century.
中国挑战日本对一座7个多平方公里小岛的控制权 — — 这座小岛地处中国东海，日本称之为尖阁列岛，而中国则称之为钓鱼岛。	China challenges Japanese control over more than seven square kilometers of islets – called the Senkaku Islands in Japan, and the Diaoyu Islands in China – in the East China Sea.
类似地，丝绸之路 — — 主要是指途径阿拉伯世界抵达欧洲的陆路通道 — — 让中国接触到印度的天文学、植物和草药，也接触到了佛教和伊斯兰教信仰。	Likewise, the Silk Road – primarily the overland route, which also passed through the Arab world to Europe – gave China access to Indian astronomy, plants, and herbal medicines, while introducing it to the Buddhist and Islamic faiths.
多数发展中国家已经在很大程度上实现了向对外贸易开放，放弃了过去那种最为有害的贸易政策（比如对进口采取数量限制 ） 。	Most developing nations have opened themselves significantly to foreign trade and no longer employ the most damaging policies of the past (such as quantitative restrictions on imports).
一个社会中的大部分工人都自我就业 — — 成为店主、独立专业人士或艺术家 — — 有各自的就业条件，同时能够过上体面的生活，这种社会只有在全经济生产率相当高的情况下才可行。	A society in which most workers are self-proprietors – shopkeepers, independent professionals, or artists – and set their own terms of employment while making an adequate living is feasible only when economy-wide productivity is already very high.
在多年的市场份额下跌之后，这一萎靡的表现难以解释，因为欧元区外围国的所有其他国家都录得稳健的出口增长。	This lackluster performance, which followed years of decline in market shares, is difficult to explain, given that all other countries on the eurozone periphery recorded solid export growth.
短短一年内，特朗普就从一位电视现场秀主持人兼故弄玄虚的房地产大亨，摇身一变成为全世界最强大国家的领导人，让共和党建制派颜面扫地。	In just over a year, Trump went from reality-television host and showboating property magnate to leader of the world’s most powerful country, leaving the Republican Party establishment with whiplash.
历史的经验告诉我们，市场的波动是不稳定的，波动越是剧烈，后期的翻转效应也越是明显 — — 对金融体系和经济的影响也越是明显。	History teaches that such swings are not sustainable, and that the more excessive they become, the sharper and more costly are the eventual reversals – and the graver the consequences for the financial system and the economy.
到20世纪八九十年代改革之时，将个人捆绑在文化、国家、单位和户口登记制度上的束缚在很大程度上已经不复存在。	By the time of the reforms of the 1980’s and 1990’s, bonds tying individuals to culture, the state, the work unit, and household-registration systems, for example, had largely unraveled.
但当中央银行在维持独立性所需的那种狭隘且只关注国内事务的政治授权下运作时，追求全球目标就极为困难甚至近乎不可能。	But the pursuit of global objectives is difficult, bordering on the impossible, when central banks function under the kind of narrow, domestically focused mandates that independence requires.
这样的想法要追溯至马克思 韦伯的观点。 他的观点认为有效的商业环境需要一套法律结构，这种结构应该像钟表一样准确。	Such thinking goes back at least as far as Max Weber’s argument that an effective business environment requires a legal structure as predictable as a clock.
最令我动容的是她在那时就已经预见到部落冲突的开始和伊斯兰主义者在原教旨主义纯洁性领域压倒彼此的竞争。	What strikes me the most is that she sees, even then, the beginnings of the tribal conflicts and the coming contest among Islamists to outdo one another in fundamentalist purity.
事实上，从产出、经济政策、通货膨胀和重要资产价格和金融市场的行为看，2016年将又是一个新反常态（New Abnormal）之年。	Indeed, the world economy in 2016 will continue to be characterized by a New Abnormal in terms of output, economic policies, inflation, and the behavior of key asset prices and financial markets.
但是为了支持共同的财政立场并实现货币和财政政策的更好结合，我们需要第三个组成部分：一个独立的，专注于创建风险共担机制的联邦财政机构。	But, to support a shared fiscal stance and achieve a better mix of monetary and fiscal policy, a third component is needed: an independent federal fiscal authority focused on creating risk-sharing mechanisms.
毕竟他们的历史 — — 当然包括被错误定义为“大规模现代化”的1980至2008年间 — — 都是以循环往复为主。	After all, their histories – and certainly during what was mislabeled as the “Great Moderation” between 1980 and 2008– have been predominantly cyclical.
北京—在当今世界最大的二氧化碳排放国中国，正在发生可能让有些人感到惊奇的事情 — — 随着中国寻求构建更清洁、更高效的经济，它有可能成为气候政策方面的全球领袖。	BEIJING – In what some might consider a surprising development, China – currently the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide – is emerging as a global leader in climate policy as it seeks to build a cleaner and more efficient economy.
更糟的是，美国一直阻挠其盟友印度 — — 也是巴基斯坦支持恐怖分子的主要打击目标 — — 对巴基斯坦实行任何制裁政策。	Making matters worse, the US has dissuaded its ally India – a major target of Pakistan-supported terrorists – from imposing any sanctions on the country.
通过恢复基础设施、住房和其它服务设施，并通过促进创造就业机会，使受冲突影响的人们的生活条件得以改善，来解决国内流离失所者的问题，这些事格鲁吉亚所面临的挑战。	The challenge for Georgia is to find a solution to the IDPs by rehabilitating infrastructure, housing, and other services, and by facilitating job creation so that the conflict-affected population’s living conditions can improve.
此外，随着俄罗斯政治制度变得日益高压、司法制度变得日益专断，俄罗斯富人将比现在更想在海外为财富和家庭建立安全港。	Moreover, as Russia’s political system becomes ever more oppressive, and its legal system ever more arbitrary, rich Russians will be more inclined than they already are to establish a safe base abroad for their wealth and families.
1971年，在苏联而不是不结盟运动的支持下，印度克服了巴基斯坦在孟加拉国的种族灭绝所导致的难民危机。	In 1971, it was the Soviet Union’s support, rather than that of the NAM, that helped India to overcome the refugee crisis caused by Pakistan’s genocide in Bangladesh.
就像在苏联时期一样，国家和政府官员将会被变成党的暗号，这就是梅德韦捷夫总统在普京总书记领导下所扮演的角色。	As in the Soviet era, state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers – the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin.
人们在十年前就应当明确认识到这一现实，当时由于一心一意地关注利润最大化，金融市场的系统脆弱性已经暴露无余。	That should have become obvious a decade ago, when the systemic vulnerabilities of financial markets, with their single-minded focus on profit maximization, were laid bare.
"没有美国的积极领导-即没有崇信自由贸易的政府和国会-贸易自由化就不会实现，并且会出现更多的""紧急""关税 ， "" 特别""配额和""主动""出口限制。"	"Without aggressive US leadership - which means a US executive and congress that believe in free trade - trade liberalization simply will not happen, and there will be more ""emergency"" tariffs, ""extraordinary"" quotas and ""voluntary"" export restraints."
2008年危机爆发后，意大利只拿出其他许多发达经济体的一小部分款项（相对于在国内生产总值中的占比）来救助银行。	Italy spent a fraction of what many other advanced economies marshaled (as a share of GDP) to bail out banks after the 2008 crisis.
类似地，萨尔瓦尼的德国同仁霍斯特·希霍夫（Horst Seehofer）为了保证针对试图从奥地利入境德国的寻求庇护者采取新措施，不惜在联合政府内部制造 一场危机。	Likewise, Salvini’s German counterpart, Horst Seehofer, created a crisis in the governing coalition in order to secure new measures against asylum seekers trying to enter Germany from Austria.
这就意味着欧洲复兴开发银行在未来5年内将能够每年平均投资100亿欧元来保证能够继续完成我们的目标，为东欧和私营行业提供必不可少的帮助和资金支持。	This would mean that the EBRD could invest up to €10 billion annually over the next five years, enabling us to continue to fulfill our role, providing vital backing and financial support to Eastern Europe and the private sector.
几个月后，BuzzFeed写了一篇8,500字的报道曝光前布莱巴特新闻（Breitbart News）明星评论员米罗·杨诺波罗斯（Milo Yiannopoulos ） 。	A few months later, it produced an 8,500-word expose on Milo Yiannopoulos, a former star commentator for Breitbart News.
基拉里将军将不仅仅作为一个勇士，而是一个人道主义者被世人所牢记。 作为调解人，他在1989年之后没有任何报复性举动。	Király will be remembered not merely as a warrior, but as a humanist, the conciliator who called for no reprisals after 1989, and a liberal model for many Hungarians.
例如，欧盟没能在关键时刻支持其在当地的自己人、能干的斯洛伐克外交官米罗斯拉夫·拉卡克（Miroslav Lajcak ） ， 从而严重地损害了他的威信。	It failed, for example, to back its man on the ground, the able Slovak diplomat Miroslav Lajcak, at a crucial moment, fatally undermining his authority.
与此同时，在以伊朗和真主党为代表的伊斯兰什叶派狂热分子则与致力于颠覆冷战后世界秩序、彻底改变中东的战略格局的俄罗斯政府狼狈为奸，组建了一个邪恶的联盟。	Meanwhile, an unholy alliance has formed among Shia zealots, represented by Iran and Hezbollah, and a Russian government committed to unraveling the post-Cold War order and radically changing the strategic game in the Middle East.
在某种程度上欧洲人都是基督教徒，因为人们将宗教看作么每个人自身与心目中的“神”的关系；而穆斯林则将其视为某种组织性的社会准则。	To the extent that Europeans are Christian at all, we see religion as a matter of an individual’s relationship with his or her God; Muslims see it as an organizing social principle.
有人把特朗普的胜利与西方迈向民粹主义的宏观趋势联系起来，而该现象在欧洲则尤其以英国在6月份公投脱欧为标志。	Some correlate Trump’s victory with a broader trend toward populism in the West, and, in particular, in Europe, exemplified in the United Kingdom’s vote in June to leave the European Union.
如果欧盟领导人真的关注增长和就业，他们就应该尽力修复在某些行业名存实亡的欧洲统一市场，让更多创新及高效的企业可以更快成长。	If EU leaders are committed to growth and jobs, they should work on repairing a European single market that in several sectors is “single” in name only, so that more innovative and more efficient companies can grow faster.
归根结底，爆发最严重的安全失败 — — 如日本偷袭珍珠港将美国拖入第二次世界大战，以及2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击 — — 往往都是由于准备不足。	After all, the worst security failures – for example, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which dragged the US into World War II, and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks – tend to arise from inadequate preparation.
比如，它需要制定有效的土耳其政策。 土耳其是北约成员国，在叙利亚有很大的利益 — — 并且有时候与美国存在利益冲突。	For example, it will need to devise an effective policy toward Turkey, a NATO member with strong interests in Syria – interests that, at times, conflict with America’s.
苹果公司董事长乔布斯倒签股票期权丑闻代表了创新、追查以及改革的微观生态。 现在制定规则禁止倒签，这一特定的骗术就不会重演了。	The options backdating scandal that recently caught Apple’s chairman, Steve Jobs, is a microcosm of innovation, prosecution, and reform; now that a rule has been written to prohibit backdating, this particular scam will not happen again.
还有比这种景象更典型地反应出西方世界对伊斯兰世界的社会习俗的不自在吗？ 或是，从相反角度来看，是伊斯兰世界对西方世界习俗的不自在？	Could this image be any more iconic of the discomfort the West has with the social mores of Islam, and vice versa?
银行家希望去年的债券得到偿付（产生捍卫稳定的激励 ） ， 但又希望今年获得高薪（产生利润最大化的激励，而利润最大化常常包含着冒险 ） 。	The banker wants last year’s bonds to be paid (creating an incentive to safeguard stability) but wants a high payment this year (creating an incentive to maximize profit, which usually entails risk-taking).
如果你是购买理应有效果的产品的顾客，你会想要第九名（共十名）的计划；如果你是自认为能增加价值的风险资本家，你会想要第八名（共二十名 ） 。	If you are a customer buying a product that should work, you want the nine out of ten; if you are a venture capitalist who thinks she can add value, you want the eight out of 20.
当然，由于日本人口在快速老化，儿童数量在下降，投资者将会提出一个显而易见的问题：日本到哪里去寻找它所需要的创新型、富于创造力的人力资源？	Of course, given that Japan’s population is rapidly aging, and the number of children is falling, investors find themselves asking an obvious question: “Where will Japan find the innovative and creative human resources that it needs?”
商业银行由于获得了央行的资金而兴奋不已，把钱借给了大量并不靠谱的投资项目，而金融创新的大爆发（特别是衍生工具）更是助长了这一借贷疯狂。	Commercial banks, flush with central banks’ money, advanced credit for many unsound investment projects, with the explosion of financial innovation (particularly of derivative instruments) fueling the lending frenzy.
非正统量化宽松 （ “ 货币化二号 ” ） 能避免这一问题，因为央行的借款不需要偿付；央行资产冲抵政府负债。	Unorthodox QE (“monetization two”) avoids this problem, because the central bank’s borrowing will not be repaid; central-bank assets net out against government liabilities.
尽管最初的GDP大幅下降发生在2008年四季度和2009年一季度，但许多西方经济体至今仍没能很好地恢复，更不用说维持能全面恢复失去的就业岗位和收入的增长率了。	Notwithstanding the initial sharp drop in GDP in the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, too many Western economies have yet to rebound properly, let alone sustain growth rates that would make up fully for lost jobs and income.
基础经济学课程都有提到“向后弯曲的储蓄供给曲线”这一奇特现象：在一定的环境中，降低利率导致储蓄增加。	Basic economics courses cover the curious case of the “backward-bending supply curve of savings”: In some circumstances, lower interest rates can lead to higher savings.
但是，除了深度衰退情形，凯恩斯主义所宣称的推迟减支是避免伤害经济的必要手段的观点充其量只能说有待商榷，并且会导致唯一控制支出的时机只有长期繁荣这一推论。	But, other than in deep recessions, the validity of the Keynesian claim that delaying spending cuts is necessary to avoid undermining the economy is at best unclear, and would leave a long boom as the only time to control spending.
去年，中央政府将更多的教育和医疗支出分给了地区政府，但又没有配置更多资源 — — 也没有人能为此做些什么。	Last year, the central government delegated more education and health-care expenditures to regional bodies, without allocating more resources – and there was nothing anyone could do about it.
如果一家英国公司将程序工作外包给班加罗尔，则称为“贸易 ” ， 如果印度程序员在伯明翰做同样的工作，则称为“移民 ” — —但交易是类似的。	It is called “trade” if a British company outsources computing work to Bangalore, and “migration” if Indian programmers do the same work in Birmingham – yet the transactions are analogous.
美国共和党候选人已开始利用最近的巴黎大谋杀指责总统奥巴马 — — 并将指责对象扩大到所有未来民主党候选人 — — 表现软弱。	Republican candidates in the US are already using the recent murder spree in Paris to blame President Barack Obama, and by extension any future Democratic candidate, for being weak.
同一张报纸援引特朗普的崛起证明，在美国制度中，政治领导人在解决种族对峙等“复杂社会冲突”和其他群众不满根源方面很“无助 ” 。	The same paper used Trump’s rise to show that, in the American system, political leaders are “helpless” to address “complex social conflicts” like racial tensions and other sources of popular discontent.
根据这份报告的建议，巴拉克·奥巴马总统日前颁布了一项行政命令，呼吁所有美国政府机构利用手中的权力来促进竞争。	Acting on its recommendations, President Barack Obama recently issued an executive order calling on all US government agencies to use their authority to promote competition.
那么，如果消费者们花12美元一磅购买他们知道由现在可以供得起他们的孩子们上学的农民们采用无毒化学品、在让鸟类存活的绿茵树下种植的咖啡时，经济学家们为什么要提出批评呢？	So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children?
该委员会提交的报告（目前仅限于德语版）开始时采用了禁止关系当事者、特别是那些成年后才知道对方是自己同父异母兄弟姊妹的当事者的证词。	Its report (currently available only in German) begins with testimony from those in a forbidden relationship, particularly half-brothers and sisters who came to know each other only as adults.
电子空间将会和超短起飞和降落新技术一道，让安全、安静、可以承受并且是就在你家房子面前的马路的个人空中交通工具摆在面前。	Together with new technologies enabling Super-Short Takeoff and Landing (superSTOL) a digital airspace would put safe, quiet, affordable, street-in-front-of-your-house personal air vehicles within sight.
当前主流的“有效市场管理论”只是说市场反映了公众所知的信息，也难以持续地从市场中赚钱 — — 我们从某些投资者在危机中遭重创的投资组合中可以发现这点。	The dominant “efficient markets theory” says only that markets reflect what is publicly known, and that it is hard to make money off markets consistently – something verified by the hit that most investor portfolios took in the crisis.
而投资不足也不是因为利润 — — 不管是税前还是税后；税后公司利润占GDP之比在过去30年中几乎翻了两倍。	And the lack of investment is not because profits, either before or after tax, are too low; after-tax corporate profits as a share of GDP have almost tripled in the last 30 years.
对市场的道义批评主要集中在它倾向于让道义上有欠缺的品质类型受益、给予令人不快的动机以特权以及促成不受欢迎的结果。	Moral criticisms of the market focus on its tendency to favor a morally deficient character type, to privilege disagreeable motives, and to promote undesirable outcomes.
汉堡的海港新城有限公司和城市港口开发公司重新开发的哥本哈根部分地区不过是城市地区利用这种发展机制的两个世纪的例子。	Hamburg’s HafenCity GmbH, and parts of Copenhagen that were revitalized by the City & Port Development Company, are just two examples of urban areas that have used this type of development mechanism.
该国高速的经济增长，战略潜力，庞大的国内市场以及对基础设施，教育和科研的巨额投资，还有大规模军备建设都证明了这一判断。	The country’s rapid economic growth, strategic potential, huge internal market, and enormous investment in infrastructure, education, and research and development, as well as its massive military buildup, will see to that.
我们将我们在其中工作的组织视同于一个有权利、义务、价值、声誉和脾气的人，其管理者认为自己代表这个“人”行动。	We think of the organization in which we work as if it was a person with rights, obligations, values, reputation, and temperament, on whose behalf managers regard themselves as acting.
以习近平命名的政治意识形态，是不同于自由民主派的另外一种选择，现在既然得以确立，成为中共思想体系的一部分，那么挑战习近平就无异于挑战共产党的信仰体系。	Now that Xi’s eponymous political ideology, which proposes an alternative to liberal democracy, is part of the school of thought around which the CPC coalesces, challenging Xi is tantamount to challenging the Party’s very belief system.
来自RNA的“翻译”从22种必需氨基酸中制造出了三维蛋白质 — — 之所以必需是因为我们的身体无法制造它们，而必须从我们的饮食中摄取。	Translation from RNA creates three-dimensional proteins from combinations of 22 essential amino acids – essential only because our bodies are not able to make them, so they must be obtained from our diet instead.
初始条件很重要，在这方面，美国的政策框架似乎确保了美国经济拥有相对较高的恢复力，不仅在面临全球危机时如此，在面临国内政策动荡时亦然。	Initial conditions matter, and in this respect America’s policy framework seems to have ensured the US economy’s relatively higher resilience not only to the global crisis, but also to domestic political volatility.
负责内部市场和服务的欧盟委员巴尼耶（Michel Barnier）提出的方案十分大胆，但欧洲确实需要强大、有效的解决机制确保及时采取行动，解决银行危机。	The proposal presented by Michel Barnier, European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, is bold, but Europe does indeed need a strong, efficient resolution mechanism that ensures timely action to address banking crises.
但是，对于承受着中国关于领土和领海纠纷的坚决主张压力的国家来说，美国的强调经济参与激发了对其承诺的新疑虑。	But, for the countries bearing the brunt of China’s recalcitrant approach to territorial and maritime disputes, this emphasis raises new doubts about America’s commitment.
但是，由于自由、稳定、繁荣的乌克兰十分符合欧洲的战略利益，因此欧盟成员国政府也应该分担金融改革的负担。	But, given that a free, stable, and prosperous Ukraine is very much in Europe’s strategic interest, the EU’s member governments should also share the burden of financing reform.
发自纽约 — — 在先后被白宫和布雷巴特新闻网（Breitbart News）扫地出门后，人称特朗普总统大选总教头的斯蒂芬·K·班农（Stephen K. Bannon）发誓要重塑欧洲。	NEW YORK – After being cast out of the White House and Breitbart News, Stephen K. Bannon, often referred to as the mastermind of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, has vowed to remake Europe.
特许费制药公司专注于有可能一炮而红的已批准药物，实现了稳定的收入流和令人印象深刻的股东回报 — — 即使在股市波动最剧烈的时期。	Royalty Pharma focused on approved drugs with blockbuster potential, creating stable revenue streams and impressive equity returns – even during periods of extreme stock-market volatility.
关键在于取消诽谤案的刑事性质，从而使它们不会带来牢狱之灾；将它们只作为民事案件起诉，对被判诽谤行为成立者课以适当的罚款。	The key will be to remove the criminal element from defamation cases, and thus the prospect of imprisonment, and instead prosecute them as civil cases, with those found guilty of defamation being subject to reasonable fines.
但是世界其他国家能容纳日本大胆的经济政策实验么，还是会采取自保手段从而阻碍这个重要政策传导机制的运行？	But will the rest of the world accommodate Japan’s bold policy experiment, or will it take protective steps and thus impede the operation of a crucial policy transmission mechanism?
去年7月，NTC军队领导人阿尔-欧贝迪（Abdul Fatah Younis al-Obeidi）在一团迷雾中遇刺。	Last July, the Council’s military leader, Abdul Fatah Younis al-Obeidi, was assassinated under ambiguous circumstances.
事件发生时它依然保持冷静，并会不惜任何代价来避免做出那些可能会被视为鼓励过度冒险或是制造一小轮通胀的举措。	It remains calm in the face of events, seeking at all cost to avoid doing anything that might be construed as encouraging excessive risk-taking or creating even a whiff of inflation.
中国固定资产投资占GDP的比重正在接近前无古人的50 % ， 因此西方分析师担心新的投资导向的财政刺激只能让中国加速迈向崩溃的宿命。	With fixed investment nearing the unprecedented threshold of 50% of GDP, they fear that another investment-led fiscal stimulus will only hasten the inevitable China-collapse scenario.
只有集合众人的力量，我们才能建立一个支持气候领导力的民意风潮并营造出一个正确的发展势头，确保能快速过渡到一个可持续且公平的世界。	Only by coming together can we build a groundswell of support for climate leadership and create the right momentum to secure a fast transition to a sustainable and equitable world.
几乎所有主要标志，包括资产和住房价格攀升、贸易平衡赤字、政府和居民负债猛增以及危机以前的增长轨迹等等都给美国亮出了红灯。	Across virtually all the major indicators – including equity and housing price runs-ups, trade balance deficits, surges in government and household indebtedness, and pre-crisis growth trajectories – red lights are blinking for the US.
比如，租车服务商Uber不但改变了人们的出行方式；也在引领一场零售业革命，商品和服务可以“Uber化 ” — —客户花钱使用而不拥有它们。	"The car-sharing service Uber, for example, has not only changed how people get around; it also appears to be leading a retail revolution in which goods and services are “Uberized"" – customers pay to use them, not own them."
这些女性可能有一天会追随舒雅德·阿德拉希姆（Souad Abderrahim）的脚步 — — 她在伊斯兰复兴运动党的支持下成功当选首都突尼斯市首位女市长。	Some may one day follow in the footsteps of Souad Abderrahim, who was elected the first woman mayor of Tunis with the support of the Islamist Ennahda Movement.
但是目前也出现了投资增长快于储蓄增长的势头，美国经常账户赤字 — — 从2006年占GDP的6%下降到去年的2.5 % — —有再次扩大的危险。	But, as investment now rises relative to saving, there is a danger that the US current-account deficit, which fell from 6% of GDP in 2006 to barely 2.5% of GDP last year, will widen again.
有太多实际或潜在的“民族”可以形成世界国家体系的基础。 更重要的是，它们中的许多经过了数世纪以来的相互纠葛，早已是剪不断，理还乱。	There are simply too many “nations,” actual or potential, to form the basis of a world system of states, not least because so many of them, having been jumbled up for centuries, cannot now be disentangled.
在许多发展中国家，税收总收入有三个主要来源：对商品和服务收取的国内税（销售税和消费税 ） 、 直接税（主要对公司收取）以及最重要的对外贸易税（进口关税 ） 。	In many developing countries, total tax revenue is derived from three main sources: domestic taxes on goods and services (sales and excise taxes), direct taxes (primarily on corporations), and, most important, taxes on foreign trade (import duties).
特别是，动画、艺术、设计和软件等创新性产业 — — 大多以个人能力和天赋为基础 — — 相对更能适应冲突。	In particular, creative industries, such as animation, arts, design, and software – which are mostly based on individual skills and talent – tend to be more resilient to conflict than others.
当法国成为纳粹的傀儡政府的时候，他们都加入了抵抗组织，当法国重新获得阿尔及利亚的主权之后，他们两人又同时为其独立呐喊。	Both joined the Resistance when France was a Nazi puppet state, and both called for Algerian independence after France regained its sovereignty.
陈水扁发动的这场运动是如此坚持不懈，甚至令某些人回想起了当年毛泽东发动的文化大革命，那时整个中国都被分裂成“敌 ” “ 我”两派。	So insistent was Chen’s campaign that it reminded some people of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a time when Chinese were divided into “us” and “them.”
此外，由于水短缺是行业所面临的最艰巨的挑战之一，因此生态友好型（eco-friendly）方案要比常规方案具备更强的可行性。	And, because water scarcity is among the top challenges facing the industry, eco-friendly solutions are often more viable than conventional ones.
即将召开的罗马第二届国际营养会议将通过改善政策及增进国际团结为所有人提供制定政治目标加强营养的历史性机遇。	The upcoming Second International Conference on Nutrition in Rome will provide a historic opportunity to galvanize political commitment to enhance nutrition for all through better policies and international solidarity.
美国的反应让中国深感不安，特别是美国所谓的“重返亚洲”或“战略再平衡 ” ， 其潜台词都是遏制中国。	The US response has put China on edge, particularly America’s so-called “Asian pivot,” or “strategic rebalancing,” with its subtext of containing China.
在许多国家，一方面是30~45%的适龄劳动人口失业，闲赋在家，或只能找到兼职工作，另一方面却是企业抱怨在技术到卫生医疗等各个岗位招不到人。	In many countries, 30-45% of the working-age population is unemployed, inactive, or working only part-time. Meanwhile, companies are complaining that they cannot fill open positions in sectors ranging from technology to health care.
（至少在第一个任期内）也没有一位女性特别关注与妇女有关的议程，而研究证实农村妇女的地位在她们治下也缺乏改善。	None was particularly focused on a women’s agenda (at least not in their first terms in office), and studies show that rural women did not fare particularly well under their rule.
今天，中国已成为位居世界第二的经济体，拥有蓬勃发展的制造业和迅速壮大的富裕中产阶级。 当今中国15亿人口中有超过半数居住在城市。	Today, it boasts the world’s second-largest economy, a thriving manufacturing sector, and a rapidly growing, prosperous middle class, while more than half of China’s 1.5 billion citizens now live in cities.
马克龙劳工市场改革背后的逻辑推动了30年来从国际货币基金组织到经合组织的政策经济学家和国际机构的结构改革议程。	The logic behind Macron’s labor-market reforms has driven the structural-reform agenda of policy economists and international institutions ranging from the International Monetary Fund to the OECD during the last three decades.
土耳其、埃及和突尼斯是非常不同的国家，但有一点是相同的，他们都有伊斯兰政府（至少在埃及最新事件之前是如此 ） 。	Turkey, Egypt, and Tunisia are very different countries, but one thing that they share are Islamist governments (at least until recently in Egypt’s case).
自从11月4日以来，美国在欧洲的形象已经大变，而一旦奥巴马接任总统，他的外交风格可能还会巩固这种变化。	America’s image in Europe has changed profoundly since November 4, and the style of Obama’s diplomacy once he becomes president will probably confirm that change.
在最近的保守党年度大会上，首相梅及其内阁成员的讲话表明他们准备追求“硬退欧 ” ， 取缔给英国经济带来巨大好处的贸易安排。	At the recent Conservative Party annual conference, speeches by Prime Minister Theresa May and members of her cabinet revealed an intention to pursue a “hard Brexit,” thereby dismantling trading arrangements that have served the economy well.
安曼 — — 今年3月22日的世界水日有机会凸显出许多国家所面临的严峻现实：淡水供应已日益成为地区和全球事务中一种决定性的战略因素。	AMMAN – This year’s World Water Day, on March 22, provides an opportunity to highlight what in many countries has become a grim reality: The availability of fresh water is increasingly a defining strategic factor in regional and global affairs.
但穆巴拉克却拒绝了这一要求，还声称如果美国国务卿乔治·舒尔茨认为埃及会背叛巴勒斯坦斗争事业的话就一定是“疯了 ” 。	But Mubarak refused, saying that Secretary of State George Shultz was “crazy” if he believed that Egypt would betray the Palestinian cause.
最近，两位JBS高管 — — 乔斯利和韦斯利·巴蒂斯塔（Joesley and Wesley Batista）兄弟因腐败问题被捕，揭开了行业腐败的面纱。	The recent corruption-related arrests of two JBS executives, the brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, pulled back the curtain on corruption in the industry.
这些益处还累积于相对贫困的工人们，这些工人们缺乏讨价还价的力量来使得老板们提供他们所的确想要、而且需要的养老金。	They also accrue to relatively poor workers who lack the bargaining power to induce bosses to offer the pensions they really want – and need.
如今，中国故技重施，入侵范围包括中国、印度和巴基斯坦三国的边界点 — — 即去年解放军深入其中并导致三周军事对峙的地方。	Now, China is at it again, including near the convergence point of China, India, and Pakistan – the same place last year’s PLA encroachment triggered a three-week military standoff.
为了避免这种结果，只要中国的GDP增长超过经合组织成员国，我们的名义利率也应该相应提高，汇率应该更具弹性，而且必须承受更高的结构性通胀或人民币升值。	To avoid this outcome, as long as China’s GDP growth exceeds that of OECD economies, its nominal interest rates must also be higher, its exchange rate must be more flexible, and it must tolerate higher structural inflation.
70%的印度受访者 — — 相比之下，澳大利亚受访者的这一比例只有21 % — —同意以下说法 ： “ 母亲出去赚钱，孩子就会受罪 。 ”	And 70% of Indian respondents – compared to just 21% of Australian respondents – agreed with the statement: “When a mother works for pay, the children suffer.”
但在试图证明俄罗斯可以克服美国可能采取的任何新的战略防御措施时，普京暴露出他对俄罗斯战略核武库可能会丧失意义的担忧。	But in his attempt to prove that Russia can overcome any new strategic defense measures the US might put in place, Putin betrayed his fear that Russia’s strategic nuclear arsenal could be rendered irrelevant.
除了显而易见的好处，这些收益的重要性还体现在，如联合国儿童基金会最近所指出，一国针对脆弱儿童的社会服务投资的潜在回报，在福利抵达最脆弱群体的情况下，能够提高两倍。	Aside from the obvious benefits, these gains matter because, as UNICEF recently noteda country’s potential return on investment in social services for vulnerable children is two times greater when the benefits reach the most vulnerable.
尽管如此，欧洲央行是正确的：它在不同成员国面临截然不同的货币条件；事实上，欧元区就像是拙劣的固定汇率系统，存在固定汇率系统的所有风险。	Nonetheless, the ECB is right that it is faced with very different monetary conditions in different member states; indeed, the eurozone is akin to a badly working fixed-exchange-rate system, with all of the attendant risks.
也许必须对智力给予一些关注，然而忽略起码是同样重要的认知能力—这一趋势却不合理：正是这种能力支撑起理性的思维和行为。	Perhaps some of this attention to intelligence is necessary, but what is not warranted is the tendency to ignore cognitive capacities that are at least equally important: the capacities that sustain rational thought and action.
在这个世界上已经充斥着太多在缓解区域性贫困方面缺乏成效的发展援助计划，而中国在世界各地逐渐明朗的身影则提供了丰富的机会去重构全球经济援助和资助项目的大局。	In a world weary of the limited effectiveness of most development programs in curtailing endemic poverty, China’s growing role in countries around the world provides ample opportunity to reconstruct the landscape of economic aid and financing.

我们是否有政治意愿实施有效控制则是 — — 永远都是这样 — — 另一个问题，很大程度上，这是因为大银行很有权力，并且它们希望影子永不变。	Whether we have the political will to implement effective controls is, as always, another question – in large part because the big banks are very powerful and they would like the shadows to remain as shadowy as they are now.
特别是，EFA可以成立一个债务削减基金（Debt Reduction Fund ） — —由默克尔经济顾问委员会提出并得到德国社会民主党和绿党支持的欧洲偿债协议（European Debt Redemption Pact）改进版。	In particular, the EFA could establish a Debt Reduction Fund – a modified form of the European Debt Redemption Pact that was proposed by Merkel’s Council of Economic Advisers and endorsed by Germany’s Social Democrats and Greens.
他们相信政府干预本身会因为官僚的无能和寻租理论带来代价惨重的失败，私有利益通过这些因素试图使政策向有利于自身利益的方向发展。	They believe that government intervention tends to generate its own costly failures because of bureaucratic incompetence and rent-seeking, whereby private interests try to steer policy to their own advantage.
至于政府债务和不可持续的财政赤字方面，那些警告必须迅速实施紧缩政策否则危机不可避免的算命先生们可能要失望了。	As for government debt and unsustainable fiscal deficits, doom-mongers who warn of an inevitable crisis if belt tightening is not soon imposed are likely to be disappointed.
这并不是说中国令人印象深刻的增长记录不重要 — — 以10%左右的速度连续增长三十年，这绝对是一个历史奇迹。	This in no way detracts from the country’s impressive growth record, which, at about 10% per year for three decades, constitutes a historical miracle.
宗教 — — 其对许多人身份认同的影响力不亚于肤色 — — 应该被归为意识形态还是更加接近于民族仍有待争议。	Whether religion, which for many people establishes their identity as much as the color of their skin, should be classified as ideological, or as something closer to ethnicity, is debatable.
在中国发展高层论坛上，他强调了当前局面与1972年他与时任总统尼克松首次与毛泽东和周恩来会面时的不同。	At the CDF, he stressed how different the situation is now, compared to 1972, when he and then-President Richard Nixon first met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.
如果伊朗拒绝这个提议或没有忠于自己的承诺，这将使它国际社会中彻底孤立，并且为采取进一步措施提供了有力的依据。	Were Iran to refuse the offer or fail to honor its obligations, it would totally isolate itself internationally and provide emphatic legitimization to further measures.
恰恰由于已经有如此多的情绪被投入到了量化宽松政策之上，因此回复常态所带来的心理冲击可能是极为危险且出乎意料的。	Precisely because so much emotion has been invested in QE, the psychological effects of returning to normalcy are going to be perilous and unpredictable.
加州海岸委员会（California Coastal Commission）甚至在考虑大规模“有管理的撤退 ” ， 让居民远离海岸。	And the California Coastal Commission is even considering a massive “managed retreat” plan to move residents away from the shoreline.
在此之后，最终支撑今天欧盟一体化的构架往往更加注重经济，并任由北约和美国安全保护伞来负责欧洲的领土防御。	After that, the structures of integration that would eventually underpin today’s EU tended to be more economically oriented, and territorial defense was left to NATO and the US security umbrella.
作为总统，他受到了来自改革派的批评，指责他未能抵抗暗中破坏经济改革的多个强力集团，也没能改善伊朗和西方世界的关系。	As president, he faced criticism from reformists for his failure to resist a range of powerful groups that sabotaged economic reform and improvement in Iran’s relations with the west.
目前看来，盖特纳的“压力测试”似乎成功了，因为事实上，股票市场不只是稳定下来而已，像花旗集团和美国银行这样的银行股票的价格，还从最低点上涨了四倍。	So far, Geithner seems to have succeeded in his “tests,” as the stock market has indeed more than stabilized, with prices of bank shares such as Citigroup and Bank of America quadrupling from their lows.

相比之下，要记住前总统比尔·克林顿从未向参议院提交过《京都议定书 》 ， 尤其在95名参议员已经签署了反对此议定书的“参议院意见”决议之后。	For perspective, it is worth remembering that former US President Bill Clinton never submitted the Kyoto Protocol to the Senate, not least because 95 senators had signed on to a “sense of the Senate” resolution against it.
不过正如共和党人指出的那样，西欧国家的生活水平平均低于美国30 % ； 欧洲也面临着经济增长放缓，高失业率和不断紧绷的社会压力。	But, as Republicans point out, Western Europe’s standard of living is 30% lower than that of the US, on average; Europe also faces slower growth, higher unemployment, and heightening social tensions.

事实上，只要以色列和美国不承认，即使巴勒斯坦获得国家地位也无济于事，而墨西哥和智利将因为与美以联盟在对其具有重大意义的问题上保持距离而失去很多东西。	Indeed, little would change on the ground even with full Palestinian statehood if Israel and the US do not accept it – and Mexico and Chile could lose much in distancing themselves from an ally on a question of great importance to it.
比如说在2010年，随着中国在针对其邻国的外交政策上转趋强硬，它和印度，日本和韩国的关系都遭到了削弱。	In 2010, for example, as China became more assertive in its foreign policy toward its neighbors, its relations with India, Japan, and South Korea suffered.
中国理应对美国表现出感激和遵从，因为美国让它获得了从150年来的西方帝国主义列强和日本的蹂躏下崛起赶超的权利。	China was supposed to show gratitude and deference to the US for the right to catch up from 150 years of abuse by Western imperial powers and Japan.
结果，伊朗出现了自暴力镇压2009年绿色运动（Green Movement）以来首次严重的反对现有政权的公共不满。	The result is the first signs of serious public discontent with the regime since the violent repression of the Green Movement in 2009.
2017年4月2日，特朗普还给中国贴上货币操纵“世界冠军”的标签，但一周后他就不得不自扇耳光，告诉《华尔街日报 》 “ 他们不是货币操纵国 ” 。	As late as April 2, 2017, Trump labeled the Chinese the “world champions” of currency manipulation, only to reverse his position a week later, telling The Wall Street Journal, “They’re not currency manipulators.”
事实上，教育的回报率一直在下降，部分原因在于高技能工人的供给速度快于需求，而这又是因为非正式企业不需要高技能工人。	In fact, returns to education have been falling partly because the supply of skilled workers has outpaced demand, as most informal firms do not require them.
IMF一开始预计希腊真实（经通胀调整的）GDP将在2010—2011年间收缩5%左右，在2012年稳定下来，并在此后开始增长。	The IMF initially projected that Greece’s real (inflation-adjusted) GDP would contract by around 5% over the 2010-2011 period, stabilize in 2012, and grow thereafter.
资本流 — — 用股票和债券购买量、外国直接投资和贷款衡量 — — 在2007年至2015年间下降了三分之二，从11.9万亿美元减少到3.3万亿美元。	Capital flows – in the form of equity and bond purchases, foreign direct investment, and lending – fell by over two thirds, from $11.9 trillion to $3.3 trillion, between 2007 and 2015.
科学家们运用两种方法进行研究：一是提取出具有特定健康问题的人的特定基因DNA序列，将其与其他人群进行对比并找出两者的差异之处。	Scientists are taking two approaches. In one, they sequence the DNA of particular genes in many individuals with or without some determined health condition and look for differences between the two groups.
但印度社会的偏见太深，许多转信锡克教的人发现，他们的高种姓的新教友们主宰着这一信仰的正式宗教机构，他们获得的对待并不比在印度教中强。	But so deep is the prejudice in Indian society that many converted Sikhs found that their new co-religionists of higher castes, who dominate the faith’s official religious bodies, treated them no better than Hindus had.
但是到2013年，这一比例一举飙升至26 % ， 而且即使按照对新兴市场增长最为悲观的假设，我们预计该比例将在2025年达到39 % ， 更乐观的估计甚至可能达到50%的份额。	By 2013, this share had soared to 26%, and, even on the most pessimistic assumptions for emerging-market growth, we expect it to rise to 39% by 2025 and to as high as 50% on more bullish assumptions.
一家荷兰或马来西亚法院，甚或是联合国授权的一家特别法院（比如1988年起诉泛美洛克比空难的法院）将决定在法律层面谁来为击落MH17航班负责。	A Dutch or Malaysian court, or even a special tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations (like the one that prosecuted the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie bombing), will ultimately determine who bears legal responsibility for the downing of MH17.
但很多时候，本可以为难民提供帮助的发展组织面临经费不足和规定僵化的困扰，导致难民的需求无法得到满足。	And yet, too often, development organizations that could provide refugees with a hand up face insufficient funding and stiff regulations that prevent them from addressing refugees’ needs.
近年来，对房地产行业管制从严及从紧的货币政策已经导致固定资产投资增长率从2008年以前的年均超过25%下降到今天的20%左右。	In recent years, tight monetary policy and increasingly strict controls on the real-estate sector have caused the growth rate of fixed-asset investment to fall, from more than 25% annually before 2008 to around 20% today.
佛罗伦萨 — — 美国总统奥巴马最近出台的银行业“大修”草案，其核心思想来自美联储前主席保罗·沃尔克。	FLORENCE – Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker provided the central inspiration for President Barack Obama’s proposal for overhauling banking.
在调查期间，摩托车乘客占该院1，500起创伤病例的41 % ， 而骑车者的伤害占该院手术预算的62.5 % 。	During the survey period, motorcycle passengers accounted for 41% of the hospital’s 1,500 trauma cases, and riders’ injuries consumed 62.5% of the hospital’s surgery budget.
但是，奥巴马确实承诺要改变政策，指出在任何袭击发动前，他都要求“几乎确定不会有平民被杀或受伤 — — 这是我们所能设立的最高标准 。 ”	Obama did, however, promise a change of policy, indicating that before any strike was undertaken, he would require “near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured – the highest standard we can set.”
宪政爱国主义是由两位德国哲学家斯滕贝尔格和雅士培提出的理念。 其目的是在德国代替由于纳粹历史而彻底失信的民族主义。	Constitutional patriotism, a concept developed by two German philosophers, Dolf Sternberger and Karl Jaspers, was intended to replace the nationalism that had been discredited in Germany by the country’s Nazi past.
进一步的模拟表明，专注于某些药物类型 — — 如“孤儿病”药物 — — 的激进可能只需要2.5—5亿美元规模、包含较少的 药物就可以实现两位数的回报率。	Further simulations suggest that funds specializing in some drug classes, such as therapies for orphan diseases, could achieve double-digit rates of return with just $250-500 million dollars and fewer compounds in the portfolio.
伊拉克的民兵组织不会安稳地离开,然而它们的解散对于长期稳定是至关重要的,它本身对于该地区的稳定就是必不可少的条件。	Iraq’s militias will not go quietly, yet their dissolution is essential for long-term stability, itself a sine qua non for stability in the region.
可惜到了2015年，鉴于欧元区成员国长期积累的公共债务和银行亏损，这种方案会导致外围国家陷入更深的经济衰退，几乎肯定会导致货币联盟的解体。	Alas, in 2015, given the eurozone members’ legacy public debts and banking losses, such a scheme would cause a deeper recession in the periphery and almost certainly lead to the monetary union’s breakup.
首先，尽管有些国家可以采取财政刺激手段，但是许多国家中这一手段是有限的。 因此，该地区作为整体必需保护其来之不易的较低的公共债务。	· First, while there may be scope for fiscal stimulus in some countries, in many countries it is limited; hence, the region as a whole must protect its hard-won low level of public debt.
第二种观点是，近几十年来，金融部门一直在努力游说去监管化，花了大量的时间和金钱说服政客这才是安全而现代化的银行业方式。	The second view is that the financial sector lobbied long and hard for deregulation in recent decades, and spent a great deal of time and money persuading politicians that it constituted the safe and modern approach to banking.
标准普尔公司（Standard & Poor’s）认为，一年后，这些企业的总债务将达到14.2万亿美元，超过美国未偿还债务规模（13.1万亿美元 ） ， 使中国成为世界上第一大企业债发行国。	Standard & Poor’s found that, a year later, these firms’ total debt amounted to $14.2 trillion, eclipsing the $13.1 trillion of outstanding debt in the United States and making China the world’s largest issuer of corporate debt.
首先，关于责任分担的辩论不应该仅仅局限于现在在阿富汗的军队级别，因为，不管这些军队级别如何重要，它们只是说明了部分的事实。	First of all, the debate about burden-sharing should not be reduced solely to today’s force levels in Afghanistan, because, however important these force levels are, they tell only part of the story.
特别是习近平关于在历史发展方面存在可以辨认且永恒不变的“法则 ” — —而且既可指定又可预测 — — 的观点在上月的外事会议上显得尤为突出。	In particular, Xi’s view that that there are identifiable immutable “laws” of historical development, both prescriptive and predictive, was particularly prominent at last month’s foreign policy conference.
这种说法乍听上去不失公正，而且在一段很短的时间内，它的确获得了不完全了解情况的执政者和投资者的认同。	The message sounded fair and it did, for a short time, appeal to some policymakers and investors not fully apprised of the situation.
一些伊朗改革派和流亡人士则以一种积极的态度看待艾哈迈迪内贾德的当选。 他们认为这一届政府更可能会表现出现政权的真正立场并破除西方任何认为伊朗会妥协的奢望。	Some Iranian reformers and exiles put a bright face on Ahmadinejad’s election, arguing that his administration is more likely to show the regime’s real face and disabuse any Western hopes of compromise.
由于过去几个月民众情绪发生了很大转变，许多民主党人现在相信他们将赢得席位，甚至可能重新夺回众议院的控制权。	Owing to a major shift in public sentiment in the past few months, many Democrats are now convinced that they will win seats, and potentially reclaim control of the House of Representatives.
如果说卡梅伦的顾问们高估了他们可以从默克尔和其他人那里获得的支持，那么他们显然低估了欧洲议会的权力和效率。	If Cameron’s advisers overestimated the support that they might have received from Merkel and others, they clearly underestimated the power and effectiveness of the European Parliament.
印度近两年增长强劲（2010年11.2 % ， 2011年7.7 % ） ，但2012年放缓至4 % 。	India had a couple of years of strong growth recently (11.2% in 2010 and 7.7% in 2011) but slowed to 4% in 2012.
• 各国需深化金融体系，引导国内和该地区的大量储蓄为发展需求融资；例如，消除该地区的基础设施缺口仍然至关重要。	· Countries need to deepen their financial systems to channel the large pool of domestic and regional savings toward financing their development needs; closing the region’s infrastructure gaps, for example, remains critical.
但只有在各国都保护其母语并且公民们不让英语占领所有重要领域的前提下，英语和其他国家的语言才能够共存。	But English and national languages can co-exist only if the state protects the indigenous language and citizens do not allow English to take over all prestigious domains.
为什么在她们的州滑向毁灭边缘的时候，这些在华盛顿的政治家们却置若罔闻呢？ 这在相当程度上说明了美国政治中的失败之处。	Why these Washington politicians are idle while their state slides towards ruin says much about what’s broken in American politics.
但情况每况愈下，部分是因为中国经济减速、大宗商品繁荣结束、国际金融条件趋紧、全球增长萎靡和多年来的政策管理不善。	But the situation has only deteriorated, owing partly to China’s economic slowdown, the end of the commodity boom, tighter international financial conditions, weak global growth, and a years-long legacy of policy mismanagement.
在劳动收入下降的同时，政府对存款利率设置了上限，而是银行存款是大部分家庭的主要储蓄方式，导致家庭的资本收入偏低。	Concurrent with diminishing labor income, government-imposed ceilings on bank deposits – the primary savings vehicle for most households – have held down household capital income.
阿拉伯国家向更多元政治发展的走向令社会对警务工作的性质和宗旨产生了严重分歧 — — 而这些分歧对又反过来令改革进程变得复杂化。	The move toward more pluralist politics in Arab states has unleashed deep social divides over the nature and purpose of policing – divides that invariably complicate the reform process.
BNP似乎将宗教极端主义看作一个打破反对党 — — 受到世俗主义的城市中产阶级大力支持的孟加拉国人民联盟（Awami League）权力的武器。	The BNP appears to view religious extremism as a tool to break the power of the opposition Awami League, which is largely supported by the secular and urban middle classes.
相反，风险存在于增长如何实现的方式上 — — 换句话说，过度依赖于过时且消耗性的增长模式，而不是全面采用新的模式。	Rather, the risk lies in the manner in which this growth is likely to materialize – namely, by depending too much on old and exhausted growth models, rather than by comprehensively embracing new ones.
债务水平和剩余赤字意味着需要非常小心，但是，只要存在采取行动的共同意愿，就有在欧洲规则框架内调整的空间。	Debt levels and remaining deficits underscore the need for extreme caution, but, assuming a common will to undertake action, there would be room for maneuver within the European rules.
所有这些都是通过一个叫作ooniprobe的软件曝光的。 这个软件是为了测量网络、侦测网络审查而设计。	All of this was uncovered through the use of software called ooniprobe, which is designed to measure networks and detect Internet censorship.
从发展中国家向发达国家的移民形成最大的生产率增幅，因此这些目的国收获了移民对全球GDP总贡献的90 % 。	Because flows from developing to developed countries generate the largest productivity increases, these destinations account for more than 90% of migrants’ total contribution to global GDP.
特蕾莎修女曾在加尔各答贫民窟与结核病患者相处数十年，她观察的结果是 ， “ 当今最严重的疾病不是麻风病和结核病，而是被社会抛弃的感觉 。 ”	Mother Teresa worked for decades with TB’s victims in the slums of Calcutta, and observed that, “The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the feeling of being unwanted.”
萨尔科奇所喜欢的<<星期日>>杂志报导说两人打算结婚引发大众猜测婚礼究竟何时举行。 二人已经交换定情物。	The news in Sarkozy’s favored media outlet Journal du Dimanche that the couple plan to marry touched off a flurry of fevered speculation on when the happy event might occur.
在1999年，随着尼日利亚独裁统治的垮台和民主政治的引进，主要是穆斯林的北部省份的地方长官认为他们已经和南部的地方长官就两地轮流担任国家总统达成了共识。	With the fall of Nigeria’s dictatorship and the introduction of democracy in 1999, governors in the mainly Muslim northern provinces believed they had struck a deal with their southern counterparts on a regional rotation of the country’s presidency.
这包括推广能提高一线疗法效力的全新药物系列，以此来缩短治疗时间，从根本上防止耐药性的出现。 但光有新药是不够的。	This includes promoting new drugs lines that can enhance the potency of first-line regimens, thereby shortening treatment duration and preventing the emergence of resistance in the first place. But new drugs are not enough.
20世纪30年代初，在经历了一段时间相对自由的国际贸易后，出现了极端保护主义，最终为第二次世界大战埋下了祸根。	Extreme protectionism in the early 1930s, following an era of relatively free international trade, had devastating consequences, ultimately setting the stage for World War II.
许多选民似乎并未感觉到自身境遇有所改善，而这种感觉也是有道理的：在历经七年的痛苦煎熬之后，人均收入依然没有抬头迹象。	Too many voters, it seems, still do not feel better off, and for good reason: average incomes have barely begun to rise, following seven painful years.
年收入低于35,000美元家庭的儿童学习无能比例比年收入高于100,000美元家庭的儿童高出近一倍。	Learning disabilities occur almost twice as frequently among children in households earning less than $35,000 a year than they do in households earning more than $100,000.
此外，如果按照拟议中的方案，上述税收（现已遭到废除）既非收入中性也并非旨在为帮助法国苦苦挣扎的家庭（尤其是在农村和小城市地区）的项目提供资金。	Moreover, as proposed, the tax (which has now been rescinded) was neither revenue-neutral nor intended to fund expenditures aimed at helping France’s struggling households, especially in rural areas and smaller cities.
但是一种越来越充满敌意的、伊斯兰教和人道主义、基督教和犹太教传统之间的文化冲突正在欧洲出现 — — 尤其在法国、德国、西班牙和荷兰。	But an increasingly virulent and violent clash of cultures is emerging in Europe – particularly in France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands – between Islam and the humanitarian, Christian, and Jewish traditions.
尽管伊拉克战争和2010年12月开始的阿拉伯革命间不存在因果关系，但两者的影响已经以恶性的方式互相结合。	While there is no causal link between the Iraq war and the Arab revolutions that began in December 2010, their implications have combined in a malign manner.
然后，他们又清醒过来，看清了现实：其实没什么大的改变，几周或几月之后，老问题会重新出现，而且变得更棘手。	Then they awaken to the reality that not much has really changed, and that in a few weeks or months the problems will reappear in a seemingly even more intractable form.
即便是该计划的最佳部分 — — 即准备（但并未实际通过）让希腊主权债务的私人投资者损失50 % — —也不足以稳定希腊沉重的债务和增长问题。	Even the best part of the plan, the proposed (but not really agreed) 50% haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt, is not sufficient to stabilize that country’s profound debt and growth problems.
举了例子，假设希腊政府希望为其颓败的经济吸引6000个就业岗位而承诺向苹果公司提供每个岗位每年11万欧元，或者一次性6.6亿欧元的补贴。	Suppose, for example, that the Greek government, seeking to attract 6,000 jobs to its ravaged economy, offered Apple a subsidy of €110,000 per job per year, or €660 million.
一向狂热的中国宣传部门官员显然害怕自己没有对新的党委总书记展示足够的忠诚和尊重，很快就劫持了这个口号；中国梦已经取代了官方政治宣传中的“中国模式”标牌。	China’s ever-zealous propaganda officials, evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for the new party chief, quickly hijacked the slogan; the China Dream has replaced the “China Model” in official political branding.
官方统计说美国有15%的贫困人口，但如果我们把那些在医疗，住房，就业等方面苦苦挣扎的家庭计算在内的话，实际的数目会更加庞大，但民主共和两党却对此绝口不提。	Neither party even mentions the poor, who now officially make up 15% of the population but in fact are even more numerous, when we count all those households struggling with health care, housing, jobs, and other needs.
他们会齐心协力创造一个没有核武器的世界，在上述世界中法治而非暴力才是至高无上的准则，合作才是实现国际和平最好的担保。	They will work to achieve a world in which such weapons are no more – where the rule of law, not the rule of force, reigns supreme, and cooperation is seen as the best guarantor of international peace.
但决策者不应该因此而忽略其他东西，乃至无法为其他两起可能的风暴 — — 以及更加令人担心的，为它们汇聚形成灾难性完美风暴的可能性做好准备。	But policymakers should not be so distracted by it that they fail to prepare for the other two possible storms – and, much more worrisome, the possibility that they merge into a single more devastating one.
学生们被迫参加难道变态的考试 — — 每年参加IIT联考的人数有500,000，只有大约10,000能上线 — — 而他们往往很讨厌这些考试科目。	Students are forced to pass brutally difficult examinations – only about 10,000 of the 500,000 who take the IIT-JEE each year score high enough to be admitted – in subjects they often detest.
他们的假设 — — 并没有明说，也很可疑 — — 是在可预见的未来，美国仍能以极低的利率出售任意数量的国债。	The assumption here – unstated and highly questionable – is that the US will be able to sell an unlimited amount of government debt at low interest rates for the foreseeable future.
仍有可能，土耳其政府找到办法释放布朗森，而美国总统特朗普 — — 他急于向其核心票仓之一的福音派表忠心 — — 将取消关税。	It is still possible that the Turkish government will find a way to release Brunson, and that US President Donald Trump, anxious to demonstrate fealty to the evangelicals who form a core part of his base, will rescind the tariffs.
而随着巩固财政还是确保增长的辩论日趋激烈，显然除了实施大规模刺激政策之外，在如何启动经济方面并未形成多少共识。	As the debate on fiscal consolidation versus growth intensifies, it is clear that there is little agreement on how to kick-start the economy, beyond fielding broad stimulus packages.
如今，在位居广受关注的《美国新闻和世界报道 》 （ US News and World Report）大学排名20强的大学中，有19所是由校友控制的（以校董事会人数超过半数为标准 ） 。	Today, 19 of the top 20 American universities in US News and World Report’s much-watched rankings are controlled by alumni (defined as 50% or more representation on the Board of Trustees).
此外，不仅日本经济中的贸易部门极易受到中国经济放缓的影响，最近在尖阁列岛/钓鱼岛问题上的冲突也提升了经济减速的预期。	Moreover, not only is the tradable sector of Japan’s economy highly vulnerable to a slowdown in China, but the recent conflict over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands raises the prospect of economic decoupling.
中国电影<<卧虎藏龙>>成为非英语电影中最高收入影片，而像<<季风婚礼>>那样的印度电影则成为全球票房收入的成功典型。	The Chinese film “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” became the highest grossing non-English film, and Indian movies like “Monsoon Wedding” were global box-office successes.
事实上，德国成功降低了其总公共债务，从2012年占GDP的79.7%下降到去年的71 % ， 但法国和（特别是）意大利尽管采取了严厉的财政控制，债务比继续攀升。	Indeed, while Germany has managed to reduce its gross public debt, from 79.7% of GDP in 2012 to 71% last year, debt ratios in France and Italy have continued to rise, despite tight fiscal controls (especially in Italy).
在加纳，一种维生素和矿物质强化的新型婴儿玉米食品填补了市场空白，它价格低廉，且可以与母乳喂养自然结合。	In Ghana, a new instant maize-based product, enriched with vitamins and minerals, is the first of its kind on the market, owing to its affordability and natural integration with breastfeeding.
G20的领袖们需要再度处理棘手的国内压力，走出狭隘的议题并抵受住民粹主义的诱惑 — — 以证明那些怀疑论者都是大错特错了。	G-20 leaders need again to manage difficult domestic pressures, overcome narrow agendas and resist populist temptations – and prove the sceptics wrong.
对投资者来说，西班牙房地产资产是伟大的投资，因为欧元所带来的经济趋同的力量必然会提升其价格，也因为西班牙不再有可以贬值的比塞塔。	To investors, Spanish housing assets seemed a great investment, because the forces of economic convergence unleashed by the euro would surely push up their prices – and because there was no peseta that could lose value.
此外还需要一些收入再分配，从而让低收入工人能够投资自己 — — 当他们连覆盖基本需要都难以实现时，很难做到投资自己。	Furthermore, some income redistribution will be needed, in order to enable low-income workers to invest in themselves – which is impossible when they have just enough to cover their basic needs.
类似地，被解职的公诉官没有拿出任何有力证据证明被指控杀戮示威者的穆巴拉克的安全主管和官员的罪行，导致他们几乎全被无罪释放了。	Likewise, the sacked public prosecutor had failed to present any solid evidence against those of Mubarak’s security chiefs and officers who were accused of killing protestors, leading to acquittals for almost all of them.
如果建立在比共同利益更为深厚的东西之上，那就有所帮助。 这些东西包括语言、共同的历史感以及为文化成就而自豪。	It helps if this is based on something deeper than shared interests: a language, a sense of common history, pride in cultural achievements.
高频交易带来的快速又巨大的转变很可能继续。 交易速度低于一秒一次才过了十年，现在其速度已经与眨眼一样快了。	Indeed, HFT firms talk of a “race to zero,” the point at which trading takes place at close to the speed of light.
于是在年轻埃米尔的铁腕领导下 ， “ 半岛电视台”对两国政府发动了长年的攻击，几乎将卡塔尔和这两个国家的外交关系推上绝路。	In response, under the young Emir’s firm hand, Al Jazeera delivered a more assertive line of criticism against governments, such as those of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, that other Arab mainstream media would do their best to avoid alienating.
近几年来，公投往往不合决策者之意 — — 法国、荷兰和爱尔兰皆是如此 — — 因此没人希望走到这一步。	Given how often such referenda have been defeated in recent years – for example, in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland – that is a scenario that everyone wants to avoid.
在这种情况下开展测试只会带来极大的不安全性，导致对携带者造成不必要的困扰并给非携带者及其亲属带来虚假的安全感。	In these circumstances, testing them would only provoke massive insecurity, leading to unnecessary interventions in carriers and a false sense of security in non-carriers, as well as in their relatives.
用世界经济论坛创始人克劳斯·施瓦布的话讲 ， “ 只有释放其全部人才能力的经济体才能保持竞争优势，实现持续繁荣。	In the words of Klaus Schwab, the WEF’s founder, “Only those economies which have full access to all their talent will remain competitive and will prosper.
为了抵消由此带来的一些税收收入损失，新税法可能会取消州和地方税收抵扣，并对某些目前享受非税待遇的福利性收入征税。	To offset some of the resulting revenue loss, the new law might eliminate tax deductions for state and local taxes, and tax some of the fringe benefits that are currently excluded from taxable income.
通过用正式的和平协议来取代64年前的停战协定，就可以为针对核武升级以及其他区域稳定威胁的更广泛讨论铺平道路。	A dialogue to replace the 64-year-old armistice with a formal peace agreement could pave the way for broader discussions about nuclear escalation and other threats to regional stability.
有关石油生产的“哈伯特顶峰”理论认为，我们已经达到了生产能力的上限，油井已经干枯，石油产量将从此下滑。 如今，这一理论的信徒为数众多。	Nowadays, there are many adherents of the “Hubbert’s peak” theory of oil production, which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity, the wells are running dry, and it is all downhill from here.
以人均国内生产总值为例，其反映了一个国家的平均劳动生产率和整体工业技术成就，也是估算后发优势的一个有效标示物。	Per capita GDP, which reflects a country’s average labor productivity and its overall technological and industrial achievement, is a useful proxy to estimate latecomer’s advantage.
要求银行要有更高的股本对大经济来说是有好处的 — — 这让金融危机(和停滞的经济状态)变得更不可能，不那么严重或者两者兼而有之。	Higher equity-capital requirements for banks are good for the broader economy – they make financial crises (and the zombie-syndrome) less likely, less severe, or both.
无论如何，如果一国已经过度负债，那么可能发现无论多少实际调整和融资都不足够 — — 这个诅咒被经济学家称为“债务积压 ” 。	In any case, if a country is already too deeply indebted, it may find that no amount of realistic adjustment and financing is enough – the curse of what economists call the “debt overhang.”
他与Rawls进行过极其有价值的智慧讨论，这促使他写了几篇有关经济公正理论的论文以及在1974年出版了一本专著，这本书今天仍在被使用。	He had extremely valuable intellectual conversations with Rawls, prompting him to write several essays on the theory of economic justice and publish a book on the subject in 1974 – a book still used today.
换句话说，尽管特朗普的王朝宫廷给美国造成了一个问题，但作为隐喻，它也提供了一个解决办法 — — 它点燃了美国人对君主制的与生俱来的怀疑。	In other words, while Trump’s princely court poses a problem for America, as a metaphor, it could also provide a solution, by stoking Americans’ natural suspicion of monarchy.
正如牛津大学经济学家约翰·穆尔鲍尔（John Muellbauer）所说，国债和央行已经“将减少政府总负债相对GDP比率的重要性深深地根植到私人部门的意识中了 ” 。	As the Oxford economist John Muellbauer says, treasuries and central banks have been “hammering into the consciousness of the private sector the importance of reducing gross government debt relative to GDP.”
耐药性结核病的发病率正在上升，因为贫穷国家的医疗卫生系统缺乏筛查结核病的资源和帮助患者接受治疗的方法。	The incidence of drug-resistant TB is on the rise, because the health-care systems of poor countries lack the resources to screen for TB and to help patients comply with their therapies.
其他顾问警告他，任何可能的行动 — — 比如，在土耳其边境设立可以向外扩展的安全区 — — 都需要在整个叙利亚部署防空力量。	Other advisers warn him that any possible action – a safe zone on the Turkish border, for example, that could expand outward – requires taking out anti-aircraft defenses all over Syria.
麦肯锡全球研究所（MGI）的新研究发现，在此期间，商品、服务、金融、人员和数据的跨境流动将世界GDP推高了10%左右 — — 光是在2014年，就增加了7.8万亿美元。	New research from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) finds that cross-border flows of goods, services, finance, people, and data during this period increased world GDP by roughly 10% – roughly an additional $7.8 trillion in 2014 alone.
更低的出生率使得停滞永久化，汉森推断说，因为人们不需要在孩子身上花这么多钱，也觉得不必为未来进行那么多投资。	Fewer births perpetuated the stagnation, Hansen surmised, because people did not need to spend as much on children, and felt less need to invest in the future.
然而，在共同货币引入后第一个 10 年间，欧元区大行其道的不是迅速同化，而是不断异化。 欧元区各国关系将进一步紧张。	After the common currency’s first decade, however, increased divergence, rather than rapid convergence, has become the norm within the euro area, and tensions can be expected to increase further.
关键基本服务 — — 如教育和医疗 — — 的公共供给也许永远不如私人部门替代方案那样高效；但在高效率会造成排斥和机会不平等的领域，公共供给并不是错误。	Public provision of critical basic services like education or health care may never be as efficient as private-sector alternatives; but where efficiency entails exclusion and inequality of opportunity, public provision is not a mistake.
此外，尽管食品卫生、食品溯源和标签在改善，但任何食品安全方面的疏忽都可能在复杂而互相关联的全球粮食链中引起深远的后果。	In addition, while food hygiene, traceability, and labeling are improving, any amount of negligence when it comes to food safety could have far-reaching consequences in the complex and interconnected global food chain.
尽管普京一直在俄培植民族主义 — — 按照哈佛大学科尔顿在瓦尔代辩论俱乐部最近一次会议上的说法，普京自称为俄国“最坚定的民族主义者 ” — —俄罗斯的民族主义土壤肥沃。	Though Putin has cultivated nationalism in Russia – according to Harvard University’s Timothy Colton, at a recent meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, Putin called himself the country’s “biggest nationalist” – he found fertile ground to plow.
即便投资者依然将其当作银行账户般看待，但由于证券交易委员会的不做为，货币市场基金将继续在银行式的资本和储备规则之外运作。	As a result of the SEC’s inaction, money-market funds will continue to operate outside the scope of bank-style rules on capital and reserves, even though investors treat them like bank accounts.
其中一位是1898年创造了“花园城市”一词的英国远见人士埃比尼泽·霍华德，他将其定义为围绕开放空间、公园、工厂和农场建造的住宅社区。	One of these visionaries was Britain’s Ebenezer Howard, who in 1898 coined the term “garden city” – which he defined as residential communities built around a mix of open spaces, parks, factories, and farms.
其后传出的消息表明辛格所宣布的行动并非印度首次跨越控制线的军事打击行动；前任政府治下也曾发生过几次，作为对袭击印度领土的报复行为。	It has since emerged that the operation announced by Singh was not India’s first military strike across the LoC; several had occurred under the previous government as well, in response to military raids on Indian territory.
这不是因为默克尔缺乏远见：她曾在2010年4月描述过一个以教育升级和创新为动力的德国，那时她总结说只有一个科技不断向前推进的社会才能为所有人提供体面的就业机会。	This is not because Merkel lacked vision: in April 2010, she described a Germany powered by improved education and innovation. Only a society that advanced technologically, she concluded, could provide decent opportunities for all.
在欧盟内部，这些新成员国的环保效率已经是最高的，因此，委员会这样做，是在奖励低效率，会降低欧盟为净化环境所做 努力的效果。	In doing so, the Commission is rewarding inefficiency and reducing the effectiveness of its commitments to clean up the environment.
特别是叙利亚边境的关闭破坏了地区贸易 — — 连接大黎凡特地区、波斯湾国家和土耳其的一条关键路径被关闭。	Syria’s border closures, in particular, have impeded regional trade, by cutting off a key route connecting the wider Levant, the Gulf States, and Turkey.
在安南正在竭尽全力用其外交技巧解决叙利亚危机时，塞内加尔、马里、马拉维和几内亚比绍等国的动荡被该地区的其他力量快刀斩乱麻地解决了。	While Annan has been trying his diplomatic best to resolve Syria’s crisis, upheavals in Senegal, Mali, Malawi, and Guinea-Bissau have been swiftly addressed by other regional powers.
1834年，斯宾汉兰制度被新济贫法（New Poor Law）取代，新济贫法规定救济只限于救济院，并且需要满足非常苛刻的条件以迫使人们回到劳动力市场。	In 1834, the Speenhamland system was replaced by the New Poor Law, which confined relief to workhouses, under conditions sufficiently odious to force people back into the labor market.
因为占人口总数不到25%的阿拉伯逊尼派知道，他们无法赢得一场民主的选举。 许多逊尼派领导人还鼓励联合抵制选举。	Because Sunni Arabs, comprising less than 25% of the population, knew that they could not win a democratic election, many of their leaders urged a boycott.
如果这种后备资金的金融体系在危机发生之前就实施，问题银行就会被后备债权人重组，同时避免了正式破产程序所需的复杂的法律程序。	If such a contingent-capital structure had been in place before the crisis, troubled banks would have been recapitalized by the contingent debt holders while avoiding the complications and legal posturing inevitable in formal bankruptcy.
在即将到来的2018年3月总统选举中，得到了俄罗斯精英全力支持以及全面控制了媒体和国家机器的普京只会面对一些摆摆样子的对手。	In the March 2018 presidential election, Putin – who has the full support of Russia’s elites as well as full control of the media and state apparatus – will run against token opponents.
在当前的伊拉克战争前不久，当布什政府的经济学家林德赛提出战争花费可能介于1000亿到2000亿美元之间时，其他官员立即反对。	Shortly before the current Iraq war, when Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs might range between $100 and $200 billion, other officials quickly demurred.
更准确地说，前瞻盈利收益率 — — 即市盈率的倒数 — — 等于无风险利率加上股票风险溢价再减去盈利增长率。	More precisely, the forward earnings yield – that is, the inverse of the P/E ratio – is equal to the risk-free rate plus the equity premium, minus the growth rate of earnings.
由于被剥夺了已经被承诺和期待的资金，海地没有支付偿还借款的资金，而这会使泛美开发银行启动阻止银行贷款发放的银行政策。	Deprived of funds that had already been committed and expected, Haiti fell into arrears on money owed for loan repayment, triggering IDB policies that prevented the Bank from releasing loans.
我们已经用了技术可以以安全、廉价和足够大的规模使用这些替代能源取代几乎所有我们现在所使用的煤炭和大部分的石油。	The technology exists to use these alternatives safely, affordably, and at a scale large enough to replace almost all of the coal, and much of the oil, that we use today.
这明显地体现在一个事实中：过去15年来，真实联邦基金利率（美联储的基准政策利率，经通胀调整）在超过六成的时间里位于负区间，自2001年5月以来的平均水平为-0.6 % 。	This is apparent in the fact that, over the last 15 years, the real federal funds rate – the Fed’s benchmark policy rate, adjusted for inflation – has been in negative territory more than 60% of the time, averaging -0.6% since May 2001.
他说，2001年9月11日美国遭到了袭击，因此针对基地组织、塔利班以及它们的同谋势力的战争是一场正义战争。	The US, he said, was attacked on September 11, 2001, so the war it is waging against Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces is a just one.
对他们来说，特朗普简单的口号 — — “让美国重新伟大”听起来就好像是“让你重新伟大 ” ： 芸芸众生将获得经济力量，而已经获得成功的人不会失去任何东西。	To them, his simple slogan, “Make America great again,” sounds like “Make YOU great again”: economic power will be given to the multitudes, without taking anything away from the already successful.
布达佩斯—最近我参加了一个布达佩斯中欧大学（Central European University）的劳动经济学博士研讨班。	BUDAPEST – I recently attended a PhD seminar in labor economics at the Central European University in Budapest.
在这方面，它要求其他欧元区成员国央行 — — 以德国联邦银行为甚，在一些案例中也包括荷兰央行 — — 对德国和荷兰债券卖家的支付指令（payment orders）授信。	To this end, it asks other eurozone members’ central banks, particularly the German Bundesbank and, in some cases, the Dutch central bank, to credit the payment orders to the German and Dutch bond sellers.
相反，2004年3月11日马德里铁路系统遭到炸弹袭击并导致200人死亡后，西班牙出现了一个“文明的联盟 ” （ alliance of civilizations ） ， 通过构建与伊斯兰教之间的桥梁来解除恐怖主义的武装。	By contrast, after the March 11, 2004, bombings of Madrid’s train system, which left nearly 200 dead, an “alliance of civilizations” arose in Spain to disarm extremism by building bridges with Islam.
从管理艾滋病毒的例子中我们可以看到，投资于公共卫生能创造良性循环：人民和社会体验到更好的健康状况，就会加大投资将健康列为重点。	As we have learned from managing HIV, investments in public health create a virtuous cycle: as people and communities begin to experience better health, they invest further in making health a priority.
第一个也源于加菲尔德的构思，名为影响因子（impact factor，IF ） ， 该指标以所刊文章在前两年中平均被引用的次数为基础推定学术期刊的质量。	The first – another brainchild of Garfield’s – is impact factor (IF), which offers a putative indication of an academic journal’s quality based on the average number of times its articles were cited during the previous two years.
但是，转变正在进行 — — 从美国主导的结构性关系（structured relationships）和常设机构的世界转变为另外一个世界。	Still, a shift away from a US-dominated world of structured relationships and standing institutions and toward something else is under way.
在 2008 年，国内投资额达到 200 亿美元，而在 2009 年，资本外逃总量也达到了 200 亿美元。	Whereas inward investment reached $20 billion in 2008, capital outflows totaled $20 billion in 2009.
民主党选战的最新参与者吉姆·韦布才华横溢、但欠缺稳重，曾历任助理国防部长、海军部长和弗吉尼亚州参议员等职。	The latest entry into the Democratic race, Jim Webb – who has served as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, and Senator from Virginia – has talent, but lacks steadiness.
考虑到这个因素，应该已经有不止一位政治家步肯尼迪的后尘，在提供实现目标所需的公共财政支持的同时，站出来宣布当今一代最重要的登月计划。	With this in mind, more than one politician should have already followed in JFK’s footsteps, stepping forward to announce this generation’s critical moonshot, and to offer the public finances needed to make it happen.
而大多数中国人似乎对政府的政策非常支持，人们对政府对少数民族的残酷镇压以及对民主自由的抵制行径都表示认同。	Yet a majority of the Chinese population seems to support its’ government’s policies, including its brutal suppression of minorities and denial of democratic freedoms.
这一新民族主义具有不同的经济形式：贸易壁垒、资产保护、针对外国直接投资的行动、偏袒本国工人和企业的政策、反移民措施、国家资本主义以及资源民族主义。	This new nationalism takes different economic forms: trade barriers, asset protection, reaction against foreign direct investment, policies favoring domestic workers and firms, anti-immigration measures, state capitalism, and resource nationalism.
让我们把这笔费用与实施《东京议定书》将要耗费的1800亿美元作一下比较，何况实施《东京议定书》实际上并不会起到什么作用。	Compare that to the $180 billion cost of implementing the Kyoto Protocol, which will have virtually no effect.
从这个角度看，朝鲜最近宣布将开设其他14个特别经济区是一个积极的信号 — — 其背后有重要的金融动机支撑。	Seen from this perspective, North Korea’s recent announcement that it will open another 14 special economic zones is a positive development – one that is underpinned by significant financial incentives.
若资产价格因紧急甩卖而下跌，其他企业的偿债能力就会受到影响 — — 即便基础资产的信誉实际并未发生变化。	When asset prices fall as a result of such selling, the solvency of other firms can be affected – even if the creditworthiness of the underlying asset has not really changed.
一位首席执行官不应该得到他的员工平均工资500倍的工资并不符合我们的道义直觉，而如果某个人所得到的市场出清工资过低而不足以维持生活他不应该被允许饿死也不符合我们的信念。	It does not conform to our moral intuition that a CEO should not be paid 500 times the average wage of his workers, or to our belief that if someone’s market-clearing wage is too low to support life, he should not be allowed to starve to death.
相比之下英国监管部门的薪资水平更高，但依然不断有人从监管部门跳槽到金融机构，而且情况有愈演愈烈之势。	The United Kingdom pays its regulators more, but there is still a lot of “in and out” activity, and more than there used to be.
为了迎接即将到来的中国经济放缓和试图降低区域不稳定风险，亚洲经济体必须扩大内需，减少对中国出口的过度依赖。	As they prepare for the coming Chinese slowdown and seek to minimize the risk of regional destabilization, Asian economies must strengthen domestic demand and reduce excessive reliance on exports to China.
戴维斯，加利福尼亚州—在最近的致美国总统奥巴马的信中，思科系统公司CEO约翰·钱伯斯（John Chambers）要求美国国家安全局（National Security Agency）停止截取该公司产品并安装用于侦听外国客户的装置。	DAVIS, CALIFORNIA – In a recent letter to US President Barack Obama, the CEO of Cisco Systems, John Chambers, requested that the National Security Agency stop intercepting the company’s products to install devices for spying on foreign customers.
须知当基辛格在40年前飞抵北京的时候，他带来的可不仅仅是一场冷战的转变，还迎来了一个中美合作的新时代。	When Kissinger landed in Beijing four decades ago, he ushered in not only a Cold War transformation, but also a new era of US-Chinese engagement.
惠及数量巨大的这部分民众的工作不仅要关注培训和教育，而且还要注重允许各国充分利用自然资本的全新模式 — — 其中包括地形地貌、流域和海域 — — 但同时要避免谋求发展采取耗尽资源的方式。	Efforts to benefit this huge population must focus not only on training and education, but also on new models that allow countries to capitalize on their natural capital – the landscapes, watersheds, and seascapes – without depleting it.
类似地，民调和选举结果表明，民粹主义在整个欧洲都在抬头，而金融市场冷酷无情 — — 因为根据怀疑派的计算，欧盟拿不出必要的资金重塑信誉。	Likewise, polls and elections signal the ascent of populists across Europe, while financial markets’ vulture-like behavior stems from the cynical calculation that the EU lacks the wherewithal to restore its credibility.
76年前，约翰·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）写到，如果政府无法履行这一职责，同时“需求不足 … … 每个企业主 … … 都在相当不利的情况下经营。	If the government falls down on the job, John Maynard Keynes wrote 76 years ago, and “demand is deficient…the individual enterpriser...is operating with the odds loaded against him.
正如国际货币基金组织总裁克里斯蒂娜·拉加德今年在达沃斯世界经济论坛会议上所指出的那样，年轻的欧洲人“正在搁置自己的梦想 。 ”	As Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, noted at the World Economic Forum’s meeting in Davos this year, young Europeans “are putting their dreams on hold.”
经济学家理查德·伊斯特林（Richard Easterlin）有一个著名的观察：对“幸福”的调查令人吃惊地表明，二战以来人们的幸福几乎没有增长，尽管趋势收入增长相当大。	The economist Richard Easterlin famously observed that surveys of “happiness” show surprisingly little evolution in the decades after World War II, despite significant trend income growth.
利马—在全球央行行长和财政部长齐聚秘鲁参加国际货币基金组织（IMF）年会之际，新兴世界呈现出各种经济脆弱性增加的症候。	LIMA – As central bankers and finance ministers from around the globe gather for the International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings here in Peru, the emerging world is rife with symptoms of increasing economic vulnerability.
但2015年后，整个撒哈拉以南非洲地区的增长有所放缓，而大宗商品价格的悲观前景也让人们开始质疑非洲的经济前途，许多人开始怀疑“非洲崛起”叙事 — — 更有人宣布非洲崛起的概念已死。	But, since 2015, growth across Sub-Saharan Africa has weakened, and the poor outlook for commodity prices has cast doubt on Africa’s economic promise, leading many to question the “Africa rising” narrative – and some to pronounce it dead.
在缺乏成功的平民主义政治家的非洲，祖马的行为榜样可能来源于拉丁美洲。 在拉丁美洲，收入不平等问题也是极端严重的，而且，工会运动和南非一样，非常强大而好战。	In an Africa bereft of successful populist politicians, Zuma’s role models may come from Latin America, where income inequality is also extreme and the trade-union movement, as in South Africa, is strong and militant.
只不过几个小时，3000多无辜平民被突如其来的暴行夺去了生命，其中大多是美国人，但也有来自其他115个国家的人。	In a matter of hours, more than 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans, but also people from 115 other countries, had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them.
自十一届三中全会结束习的改革计划公诸于世以来，许多中国观察家都称赞他是邓小平以来最具变革精神的领导者。	Since the Third Plenum ended and the scope of Xi’s reforms has become clear, many China watchers have hailed him as the most transformative leader since Deng.
去年九月，鲁哈尼的魅力攻势在联合国大会上大放异彩，当时他可以提供实实在在的东西 — — 关于伊朗核计划的协议 — — 让人们认为伊朗的强硬外交政策立场终于要软化了。	It worked well in the United Nations General Assembly last September, when he had something solid to offer – a deal on his country’s nuclear program – raising hopes that Iran’s hardline foreign-policy stance would finally soften.
但讽刺的是，在支付区刚开始建立的时候，许多私有银行自愿将自己的系统整合进支付区，但许多国有银行系统却是苦心经营了多年。	The irony here is that, at its beginning, participation by private banks in SEPA was strictly voluntary. But many of the national systems have been evolving for many years.
专家对这样的宣传嗤之以鼻，但民调显示这些广告是有效的，而在那一年的选举中，许多民主党在任者 — — 特别是女性 — — 败走麦城。	Experts ridiculed these claims, but polling suggests that the advertisements were nevertheless effective, and a number of Democratic incumbents, and women in particular, lost elections that year.
一厢情愿的美国新保守主义者严重低估了这项任务的难度 — — 而伊朗革命党人却恰恰相反，他们迅速行动夺走了美国种下的果实。	The US neocons, with their wishful thinking, grossly underestimated the scale of the task at hand – unlike the revolutionaries in Iran, who quickly moved in to reap what the US had sowed.
无论是沿海地区对内陆地区还是城乡之间经济发展的不平等，这些国家必须想办法解决越来越大的差距，因为严重的不平等势必会影响它们继续保持增长的能力。	Whether it is coastal versus inland or rural versus urban, these countries must tackle the widening disparities, because high inequality may well threaten their very ability to continue growing as they have.
自尊的缺失严重拖累了许多欧盟成员，首当其冲的就是德国，尽管它对自己的未来已经恢复了信心，但仍然死命地捍卫者自己的资源。	Such a dispensation is severely lacking in many parts of the EU, beginning with Germany, which, despite having regained confidence in its own future, jealously guards its resources.
更为重要的是，不仅仅是德国足球队，而且是整个国家都在以一个年轻、帅气、悠闲以及无忧无虑形象昂首阔步，也就是汇纳百川、友善以及风趣幽默。	More importantly, not only in the German team, but also in the country as a whole, a young, cool, laid-back, and carefree Germany is raising its head – a Germany that is cosmopolitan, friendly, and good-humored.
此外，同等重要的还包括制定有关隐私和加密安全、后门、删除儿童色情、仇恨言论、虚假消息和恐怖威胁的规则。	Equally important is the development of norms regarding privacy and security regarding encryption, back doors, and the removal of child pornography, hate speech, disinformation, and terrorist threats.
美国国务卿约翰·克里在寻求以巴和解过程中的所作所为就好像各方可以凭借良好意愿，通过非强制性的解决方案来化解冲突。	US Secretary of State John Kerry, in his bid for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement, operated as if conflict resolution could be achieved through non-coercive solutions, deriving from the good will of the relevant parties.
两年时间，对再培训来说也够长了。 两年以后，员工可能不需要政府补贴便能拿到更高的工资，这似乎也合情合理。	It seems plausible that two years is long enough for retraining, after which the employee might command a higher wage without a government subsidy.
多年来的研究，以及全世界各地患者的强烈请求，终于打开了一条通向体细胞核转移技术之路，也就是人们所知道的“治疗性克隆 ” — —那也许会为我们所有人的健康带来跨时代的改变。	Years of studies, and the passionate pleas of patients worldwide, are finally opening the way to a technique – somatic cell nuclear transfer, also known as “therapeutic cloning” – that may bring about epochal changes for the health of us all.
事实上，特朗普可以为实现其他目标而采取行动 — — 从推动美国经济到强化美国全球影响力 — — 但同样也可以推进气候议程。	In fact, there are actions that Trump can take for other ends – from boosting the US economy to enhancing America’s global influence – that would also advance the climate agenda.
事实上，非洲农业仍由小农主导，他们无法获得提高生产率的技术，主要集中于少数产品，与市场、制造业和更广义的经济联系也不太密切。	Indeed, African agriculture is still dominated by small-scale farmers who lack access to productivity-boosting technology, focus mainly on a narrow range of products, and remain poorly linked to markets, manufacturing, and the broader economy.
此外，如果英国首相特蕾莎·梅（Theresa May）维持其原定每年净移民减少到10万以下的目标，英国将不得不采取大规模 — — 也可能耗资巨大 — — 的措施去关闭英国劳动力市场。	Moreover, if British Prime Minister Theresa May follows through on her stated goal of reducing annual net immigration to less than 100,000, the UK would have to implement drastic – potentially costly – measures to close off the UK labor market.
东道国可以自由选择自己的谈判团队，但必须要由账户管理人在一支由专家志愿者组成的国际顾问委员会的协助下来确认这支团队是世界级的。	The country would be free to choose its own team, but the escrow account manager, aided by an international advisory board of expert volunteers, would need to agree that it is, in fact, world-class.
在这一紧张气氛下，北部的总统候选人阿拉萨内· 瓦塔拉（Alassane Ouattara ） ， 一位曾任国际货币基金组织高级官员的穆斯林被剥夺了2005年总统大选的参选权。	In this tense climate, the northern candidate, Alassane Ouattara, a Muslim and former senior official at the International Monetary Fund, was denied the right to run in the 2005 presidential election.
但在世界其他角落，一些当前最重大的问题则带有某种黑格尔哲学的意味 — — 它们都是从前为解决某些问题或者某些成功事件所导致的结果。	Elsewhere, some of our biggest problems have a sort of Hegelian quality. They are the result of solving past problems or of past success.
但如果西方希望遏制基地组织在也门的活动，就需要推动萨利赫与胡塞和南方叛军达成谅解，而这无疑将意味着双方共享权力。	But if the West is to curtail Al Qaeda’s activities in Yemen, it will need to push Saleh into reaching accommodations with both the Houthis and the southerners, and this will undoubtedly mean sharing power with them.
除非中国将身为现代化全球大国的责任置于其狭隘的国家利益之上，否则朝鲜的危险局势将伴随金氏政权的动荡而日益恶化。	Until China puts its responsibilities as a modern global power ahead of its narrow national interests, the danger from North Korea will grow as the Kim regime becomes ever more unstable.
欧盟要想继续朝着强大而紧密的政治经济实体迈进（尽管还算不上真正的联邦国家 ） — —它就必须为所有民众创造美好而可靠的生活。	For the EU to continue its march toward a stronger and closer polity and economy –one that nevertheless falls far short of a federal state – it must offer the credible prospect of a better life for all of its citizens.
中国和其他国家将会发展这些能力，但是据许多军事分析家认为，中国要在短期内缩短与美国的差距的可能性不大。	China and others will develop some of these capabilities, but, according to many military analysts, China is not likely to close the gap with the US soon.
纽约 — — 近期，中国政府宣称将在2020年之前将上海打造成全球金融中心， 类似于伦敦和纽约目前的地位。	NEW YORK – Recently, China’s government announced that it wants Shanghai to become a global financial capital equal to London and New York by 2020.
当主流政治家，报纸和教会都对以色列大加斥责之时，许多瑞典穆斯林也无可避免地认为这是给他们开了绿灯，让他们可以像普通犹太人宣泄自己的敌意。	When mainstream politicians, newspapers, and churches rail against Israel, many Swedish Muslims inevitably see this is a green light for them to unleash their own hostility toward ordinary Jews.
美国情报机构曾就俄方这一策略向奥巴马提出警示，而总统则在2016年9月与普京会面时警告对方不要贸然行事。	US intelligence agencies alerted President Barack Obama of the Russian tactics, and he warned Putin of adverse consequences when the two met in September 2016.
纯科学就像这个名称所表现的那样，被人们理解为“核心问题 ” ， 它没有被有关实际的考量所沾染，以来自自然的正确的经验和理论调查为根基。	Pure science, as the name suggests, is presented as the “real thing,” untainted by practical considerations and rooted in properly conducted empirical and theoretical investigation of nature.
莫扎特之所以叫它“不和谐四重奏 ” ， 很大程度上是因为第一乐章的不同寻常。 而这一标题倒是很好地契合了如今法国政坛的丑陋窗台。	The title, linked to its highly unusual first movement, describes perfectly the far less beautiful state of French politics today.
没人会认为伊朗是模范国际公民，或者很快会成为模范世界公民，但对伊朗核野心的这一看法构成了对形势的一个根本性误解。	While no one should be under any illusion that Iran has been a model international citizen, or is likely to become one any time soon, this perception of the country’s nuclear ambitions involves a fundamental misreading of the dynamics in play.
班加罗尔—美国总统奥巴马最近在联合国谈到了如何打击伊斯兰国，许多批评者抱怨他过于强调外交，而对使用武力强调不够。	BANGALORE – When US President Barack Obama recently spoke at the United Nations about countering the Islamic State, many of his critics complained that he put too much emphasis on diplomacy and not enough on the use of force.
但这些数字固然巨大，与商业银行、机构投资者和其他私人金融机构和个人所持有的305万亿美元金融资产相比只是九牛一毛。	But such figures, though large, pale in comparison with the $305 trillion worth of financial assets held by commercial banks, institutional investors, and other private financial institutions and individuals.
回到1950年代，六个发起国的外交部长很快便转向他们的比利时同僚Paul-Henri Spaak寻求新的提案。	Back in the 1950’s, the founding nations’ foreign ministers promptly turned to their Belgian colleague, Paul-Henri Spaak, for fresh proposals.
韩国就是这方面最好的例子。 但与此相对的情况也很常见，比如香港，那里飞速的经济发展与中央计划的教育政策毫不相关。	But for every such case – South Korea is the favorite example – there is another, like Hong Kong, where meteoric economic growth had nothing to do with centrally planned education policy.
1997年，我在卸任末代港督、离开香港前夕，访问了一家精神病医院，一位住院病人问了我一个精神非常健全的问题。	Just before I left Hong Kong in 1997, after departing from my post as the city’s last British governor, I visited a hospital for the mentally ill, where an in-patient asked me an eminently sane question.
而就连建立联系的过程也并不严格：例如，科达伊的方法鼓励不按特定书面曲谱来进行团体合唱，目的是促进小组成员之间的互动。	And even that process is not rigid: for example, his method encourages group singing without adherence to particular written notes, in order to foster interactions within the group
对于共和党而言，把佩林有关美国在反恐战争中的神圣使命放在一边不谈，人们很难相信麦凯恩确实相信美国在伊拉克无限期驻军是可以维系的事情。	As for the Republicans, setting aside Sarah Palin’s talk of America’s divine mission in the war on terror, it is inconceivable that John McCain truly believes that a US presence is sustainable in Iraq into the indefinite future.
这在很大程度上取决于外部援助何时或是否能落实，而后者又取决于埃及32亿美元IMF贷款谈判能否获得批准。	Much depends on when, or whether, external aid materializes, which is contingent on approval of Egypt’s renegotiated $3.2 billion IMF loan.
随着希腊留在欧元区的希望逐渐渺茫，将爆发存款挤兑，导致银行系统 — — 最终将是实体经济 — — 崩溃。	As confidence that Greece will remain in the eurozone plummets, a run on deposits will cause the banking system – and, eventually, the real economy – to collapse.
法国总统候选人马丽娜·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）想退出欧盟的原因是，如她所说 ， “ 欧洲人民不想再要它了 。 ”	French Presidential candidate Marine Le Pen wants to kill off the EU because, she says, “the people of Europe do not want it anymore.”
这场危机决不能成为借口，让人可以创造新的制度形式来破坏欧盟不同制度间的微妙平衡。 这种平衡—通过适当的调整—已经经受住了时间的考验。	The crisis must also not become an excuse to create new institutional formats that jeopardize the delicate balance between the different EU institutions, a balance that – through appropriate adjustments – has been proven by the test of time.
伯克利—美国正面临新一轮联邦政府支出削减，这一回至少要从GDP增长中削去0.5%个百分点，减少至少100万个就业岗位。	BERKELEY – The United States is confronting another round of cuts in federal government spending, this time threatening to trim at least 0.5 percentage points from GDP growth and to precipitate a loss of at least one million jobs.
普林斯顿—比尔·克林顿1992年竞选首席战略顾问詹姆斯·卡维尔（James Carville）有句名言，道出了赢得大选的一点现成内幕智慧 ： “ 经济最重要，笨蛋 。 ”	PRINCETON – James Carville, Bill Clinton’s chief campaign strategist in 1992, famously expressed a bit of established insider wisdom about winning elections: “It’s the economy, stupid.”
但是，左派的退位并不表示右派就有条理清晰的经济方案，因为法律与公正党（PiS）和公民纲领党（PO）的成功结盟在自由主义（PO）和民粹主义（PiS）之间的摇摆中岌岌可危。	But the demise of the left does not mean that the right has a coherent economic program. For the victorious coalition of the Law and Justice (PiS) party and Civic Platform (PO) is torn between liberal (PO) and populist instincts (PiS).
像波兰这样具有强烈民族牺牲意识的基督教国家一样，朝鲜曾在漫长的历史上被大国所主导，这些大国主要是中国，但也包括俄罗斯，其中最明显的是16世纪日本统治者野蛮的侵略历史。	Like Poland, which has a strong Christian self-image of national martyrdom, Korea has a history of being dominated by greater powers, mainly China, but also Russia, and, most notably since the brutal invasions of the sixteenth century, Japan.
自2005年以来，在国内储蓄过剩、资本账户严格管制和信贷高速扩张的背景下，中国商业银行的官方利率相对需求一直处于过低水平，而且受限于存款和贷款利率的严格管制。	Given excess domestic savings, a tightly controlled capital account, and rapid credit creation, interest rates have been low relative to demand since 2005.
但是，这种竞争在揭示新的全球稀缺资源的同时，也会带来价格的提升，从而鼓励生产者们增加产量并提高产能。	But, while such competition would reveal new global scarcities, it would also bring higher prices, thereby encouraging producers to increase yields and productivity.
亚投行和即将成立的由金砖国家（巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非）经营的新开发银行的国际化特征最为明显，但它们只是冰山一角。	While the AIIB and the forthcoming New Development Bank, operated by the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), are the most visible internationally, they are only the tip of the iceberg.
中国和印度或许不满于俄罗斯在乌克兰的行动，但新兴经济体都不会在联合国安理会上投票反对俄罗斯，即使投票说到底没有什么意义。	China and India may not have been happy about Russia’s actions in Ukraine, but none of the emerging economies could bring itself to vote against Russia in the United Nations General Assembly, even though the vote was ultimately meaningless.
海洋生物多样性的其他部分 — — 尤其是珊瑚、海洋哺乳动物、海鸟和海龟 — — 也正在疲于应对人类的压力。	Many other components of marine biodiversity – especially corals, marine mammals, seabirds, and turtles – are also struggling to withstand human pressures.
发自新加坡 — — 由于在新兴市场（尤其是中国）的销售额走低，财务数据令投资者感到忧虑，奢侈品牌公司的股价在7月大幅下挫。	SINGAPORE – Luxury-brand companies’ stock prices plunged in July, after their financial results disappointed investors, owing largely to slower sales in emerging markets, especially in China.
但虽然俄罗斯二战盟国均来自欧洲和北美，但西方领导人却不会出席纪念活动 — — 这是西方对普京入侵乌克兰及吞并克里米亚不满的反映。	Yet, though Russia’s WWII allies were from Europe and North America, no Western leaders will attend the commemoration – a reflection of the West’s disapproval of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.
这意味着沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（Mohammed bin Salman）的雄心勃勃的计划面临着一个漫长而不确定的过程。 萨勒曼王储意欲将基于石油的沙特经济转型为现代工业经济。	This implies that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious plan to transform his country’s oil-based economy into a modern industrial economy will require a long and uncertain process.
选民们反复选出新内阁，他们对经济的方向十分不满 — — 而新政府总是继续听命于布鲁塞尔、法兰克福和柏林所规定的方向。	Repeatedly, voters have thrown out incumbents, dissatisfied with the direction of the economy – only to have the new government continue on the same course dictated from Brussels, Frankfurt, and Berlin.
用人民币来结算中国的国际贸易账户能助中国免受美国以邻为壑政策（即允许美元对其贸易对手大幅贬值）的冲击。	Using the renminbi to settle China’s international trade accounts would help China escape America’s beggar-thy-neighbor policy of allowing the dollar’s value to fall dramatically against trade rivals.
但2004年对俄罗斯总统普京来说也是苦涩的失败之年，他试图通过支持大规模操纵投票让他所中意的总统候选人亚努科维奇（Viktor Yanukovych）上台。	But 2004 was also a bitter failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who tried to bring his favored presidential candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, to power in Kyiv by supporting massive vote manipulation.
联合国气候小组和国际能源机构都赞同这种观点，坚持提出高能效可以降低能耗30%之多 — — 提高能效也因此成为控制气候变化的一种有效途径。	The United Nations’ climate panel and the International Energy Agency both echo this sentiment, insisting that higher energy efficiency could reduce energy consumption by up to 30% – making improved efficiency an effective remedy for climate change.
撤出乌兹别克斯坦的喀什－迦拿巴（Karshi-Khanabad）空军基地后，使用吉尔吉斯斯坦的玛纳斯（Manas）空军基地已经成了从中亚地区为美国在阿富汗驻军补充给养的主要方法。	With the loss of the use of the base at Karshi-Khanabad in Uzbekistan, access to Manas airfield in Kyrgyzstan has become the main means of re-supplying US troops in Afghanistan from Central Asia.
或许这最终会发生，但是，尽管美国和国际货币基金组织（IMF）在G-20框架下做出了大量努力，但这一再平衡过程仍未结束。	This is likely to happen eventually; but, despite efforts by the US and the International Monetary Fund in the context of the G-20, this rebalancing process has not yet been completed.
例如，根据经济学人杂志报导，麦当劳巨无霸汉堡包在欧元区的售价是大约三欧元，根据目前的汇率大致为四美元，但是在美国只有大约3.2美元。 这表明欧元价格高估大约25 % 。	For example, according to The Economist , a Big Mac hamburger sells in the euro zone for about three euros – roughly $4 at the current exchange rate – but for only about $3.20 in the United States, implying that the euro is overvalued by about 25%.
更糟的是，特郎普的影响甚至可能超越美国影响到其他地方的极右翼领袖，比如奥地利的诺伯特·霍费尔，后者可能模仿他的策略煽动并利用尘封已久的本土主义。	Making matters worse, Trump’s impact may even extend beyond the US, with far-right leaders elsewhere, such as Austria’s Norbert Hofer, emulating his tactics to stoke and capitalize on atavistic nativism.
例如，1908年在西伯利亚上空爆炸的小行星具有一颗氢弹的威力，如果在一座大城市上空爆炸，就有可能杀死数以百万计的人口。	For example, the asteroid that exploded above Siberia in 1908 with the force of a hydrogen bomb might have killed millions of people had it exploded above a major city.
以色列副总理佩雷斯说，以色列希望通过与逊尼派阿拉伯势力范围公开的合作来孤立并且遏制什叶派和波斯势力范围。	According to Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres, Israel hopes to isolate and contain the Shi’a/Farsi spheres of power by forging open cooperation with the Sunni/Arab domain.
让所有给政府的支付透明化将会带来更大的进步，而西方国家政府只要通过把这一要求与税收抵扣捆绑在一起就可以鼓励做到这一点。	Making all payments to governments transparent would bring further progress, and Western governments could encourage this simply by tying this requirement to tax deductibility.
最后，难民危机引发了一项包含欧盟外部边境执法，各成员国之间寻求庇护者分配机制以及拨款协助这些人融入所在国的联合计划。	Finally, the refugee crisis has led to a discussion of a joint scheme for enforcing the EU’s external borders, allocating asylum-seekers among its member countries, and financing their integration.
沙特能对西岸执政的巴勒斯坦政党法塔赫运动施加财务影响，而且他们愿意考虑边缘化哈马斯，而后者是在加沙地区执政的伊斯兰民兵力量。	The Saudis have financial leverage over Fatah, the ruling Palestinian party in the West Bank, and they are open to marginalizing Hamas, the Islamist militia that rules in Gaza.
但是两国的经济结构，以及推动能源需求的因素—于是包括温室气体的排放—却大相径庭。 正是这种差异为正面处理气候变化提供了最佳时机。	But the structure of the two countries’ economies, and what drives their energy needs – and thus greenhouse gas emissions – are very different. It is this difference that offers the best chance for addressing climate change head-on.
这些调查的目标应该是厘清青少年的可避免风险因素暴露情况，比如酒精和违禁药物使用、不安全性行为、暴力、肥胖、缺乏运动以及不健康饮食等。	Among other things, such surveys should aim to create a clear picture of adolescents’ exposure to avoidable risk factors, such as alcohol and illicit drug use, unsafe sexual behaviors, violence, obesity, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet.
但反过来，那些业已存在的机构也在拼命维护自己的自主权，反抗任何试图迫使他们采纳哪怕极为微小的协调和规管的举动。	In response, the existing bodies are vigorously defending their autonomy, resisting any attempts to impose on them a modicum of coordination and discipline.
这些活动都与农业规模的扩大紧密相关，因为这些卖家都更偏爱临近的种植者，即便这些“农夫”越来越都是些城里人。	Such campaigns go hand-in-hand with expanded farming, because sellers of these foods prefer nearby growers – even if these growers increasingly live in the city.
它将把所有作实际工作的人，也就是商人、武士、记者以及其他人统统置于政党理论家之下，而这些理论家唯一的工作就是寻找敌人。	It will subordinate all who really do work – traders, warriors, journalists, and others – to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies.
“这让拿下总体日程价值更低的政党 — — 比如希特勒 — — 站出来说，既然游戏规则导致长期大面积失业，那么就应该改变游戏规则 。 ”	“It was left to other parties with less worthy overall agendas – Hitler, for example – to step in and say that if the rules of the game led to prolonged spells of mass unemployment, then the rules of the game had to be changed.”
但其中许多这类决定却导致了糟糕的后果，而这很大程度上是因为信息技术（电脑以及其运用方式）消灭了很多中产阶级的工作。	Many of these decisions turned out badly, largely because information technology (computers and how they are used) eliminated many middle-class jobs.
法国、意大利以及西班牙在南黎巴嫩都驻扎有大量的联合国部队，2006年夏天的战争结束后部队规模扩大了。	France, Italy, and Spain all have large contingents in the UN force in south Lebanon that was expanded after the summer 2006 war.
但共和党推出了一位富有的“大嘴巴”加入战团，他抨击传统政客是“蠢货 ” ， 并称他单枪匹马就可以解决战斗。	But it suited a wealthy, noisy braggart who barreled into the race attacking conventional politicians as “stupid” and insisting that he alone could get things done.
两个月后，葡萄牙举行的类似游行高举同样希特勒化的默克尔肖像，高声叫喊的示威者身着丧服，谴责德国领导人实习“屠杀穷人的政策 ” 。	Two months later, in Portugal, similar parades featured the same Hitlerized Merkel caricatures, borne by howling demonstrators dressed in mourning clothes and decrying the German leader’s “policy of massacring the poor.”
同时蒙蒂联盟因经典资产阶级政党在意大利向来缺乏吸引力而功亏一篑，因此许多观察家都好奇他将在下届政府中扮演何种角色。	At the same time, with Monti’s coalition failing to gain traction, reflecting the historically limited appeal of classic bourgeois parties in Italy, many observers are wondering what his role in the next government will be.
与此相反，像中国和印度等避免资本大量流入的国家力保具有高度竞争力的本国货币，从而维持了利润率和较高的投资水平。	By contrast, countries like China and India, which avoided a surge of capital inflows, managed to maintain highly competitive domestic currencies, and thereby kept profitability and investment high.
既然中国的多边贸易顺差是一个经济问题，许多国家也对此表示担忧，那么美国应该寻求一个多边的，有规则可依的方案。	Since China’s multilateral surplus is the economic issue and many countries are concerned about it, the US should seek a multilateral, rules-based solution.
阿拉伯社会，尤其是动荡中的阿拉伯社会，正日渐回归到另一位法国社会理论家涂尔干所谓的“机械性团结”之中。	Arab societies, particularly those in turmoil, are regressing to what another French social theorist, Émile Durkheim, called “mechanistic solidarity.”
因此，基金组织发出的信息是，明年经济增长将反弹至3.6 % 。 正如德意志银行所指出的，国际货币基金组织的预测表明，2020年陷入衰退的国家将比近几十年的任何时候都要少。	After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.
中国经济增长已经放缓，出口急剧回落，失业率大幅上升，而且其主流的观点认为 ， “ 先责怪美国”的策略是很有道理的。	Growth has slowed, exports have plummeted, and unemployment has jumped, and the prevailing view has been that a “blame America first” strategy makes the most sense.
日本从传统上就不是移民国家，而世界经济论坛的全球性别差距报告总共统计了136个国家，其中日本排在第105位。	Japan has not traditionally been a country of immigration, and the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report, which ranks 136 countries, has Japan in 105th place.
沙特阿拉伯不会停下脚步，除非伊朗 — — 及其什叶派代理人 — — 放弃其革命幻想，开始致力于将和平与稳定带给中东和更广阔的阿拉伯世界。	And Saudi Arabia will not stop until Iran – and its Shia proxies – abandons its revolutionary fantasies and begins working to bring peace and stability to the Middle East and the wider Arab world.
如果“成家”依然是女性的职业壁垒，而对男性并非如此，那么这便是一个女性权利问题（从而也是人权问题 ） 。	If “having a family” is still a career barrier for women, but not for men, that, too, is a matter of women’s rights (and thus of human rights).
另外还有欧洲金融稳定机构的主管克劳斯·雷格林，德国联邦银行主席阿塞尔·韦伯，还有现任欧洲央行执行董事会董事的荣根·斯塔克。	Others include Klaus Regling, head of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), Axel Weber, President of the Bundesbank, and Jürgen Stark, a current member of the ECB’s Executive Board.
八年过去了，MIST经济体在未来仍有机会各自占到全球GDP的2~3％左右，但这四个国家都不太可能达到金砖四国的经济规模（或许除了俄罗斯之外 ） 。	Eight years later, the MIST economies still have a chance to account for around 2-3% of world GDP in the future. None is likely to reach the size of any of the BRIC economies, except, perhaps, Russia.
2007年，联邦最高法院大法官以5票赞成4票反对的比数作出裁决，支持州一方。 而在2009年，美国国家环境保护局得出结论，认定特定种类的温室气体会危及公共福利。	In 2007, the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision, siding with the states; and in 2009, the EPA concluded that certain greenhouse gases endanger public welfare.
1966~1967年的收支危机反映出英国的工资增速要高于其生产力增速，并随之产生贸易逆差，而外国投资者们也不愿意去出资支撑一个在他们看来不可持续的点位。	The balance-of-payments crisis of 1966-7 reflected the tendency of British wages to grow faster than productivity, the consequent trade deficits, and foreign investors’ reluctance to finance a position they saw as unsustainable.
此外，尽管叛军仍然主要局限在埃及外围，主要是东北部的西奈半岛和西部沙漠的部分地区，以及尼罗河谷地区的零星打击，但在开罗也有所抬头。	And, though the insurgency has remained largely limited to Egypt’s periphery, primarily Northeastern Sinai and parts of the Western Desert, with occasional strikes in the Nile Valley, it has also reared its head in Cairo.
对于后者，被提名人 — — 他已开始迷惑这个职位值不值得如此大动干戈 — — 将与该参议员会面，以打消“误会 ” 。	In the latter case, the nominee, already beginning to wonder whether the job is worth the aggravation, meets with the senator to clear up “misunderstandings.”
Y, no obstante, el accidente que cubrió de luto a toda Polonia no fue ninguna de esas cosas.	Yet the crash that has sent all of Poland into mourning was none of these things.
香港—日益升高的中美贸易战风险迫使国际社会不得不思考一个迫切及根本性的难题：如何建立一个地缘政治中立且公平的国际货币体系。	HONG KONG – As the risk of a US-China trade war mounts, creating a geopolitically neutral and fair monetary system has become increasingly urgent.
他们还有时间做出反应 — — 通过向世人表明强大的领导力和把增长置于短视政策之前 — — 但时间已经不多，而倒计时的钟在滴答作响。	There is still time to react – by demonstrating strong leadership and prioritizing growth over short-sighted policies – but that time is limited and the clock is ticking.
在将多个国家的人均收入和自我评估的幸福水平做了相关性分析后，他得到了一个令人吃惊的结论：或许并非如此。	After correlating per capita income and self-reported happiness levels across a number of countries, he reached a startling conclusion: probably not.
和许多同龄人一样，从20世纪60年代我的学生时代起，曼德拉就一直是积极反对种族隔离制度的我心目中的英雄。	Mandela had long been my personal hero, from my student days in the 1960’s, when – like so many others of my generation – I was an anti-apartheid activist.
事实上，尽管在地缘政治问题上分歧颇多，世界最大的民主国家和世界最大的独裁国家却在对待国际法的问题上有很多共同之处。	Indeed, despite their geopolitical dissonance, the world’s most-powerful democracy and its most powerful autocracy have much in common when it comes to how they approach international law.
声称其查韦斯死后选举的胜利被窃走的卡普利亚斯最近身在智利，但智利总统皮涅拉只同意在私人晚餐上与他会晤，而不是在拉莫内达宫（La Moneda Palace）举行正式会晤。	Capriles, who claims that victory in the post-Chávez election was stolen from him, was recently in Chile, but President Sebastián Piñera agreed to meet with him only at a private dinner, not at an official meeting in La Moneda Palace.
在其《彭博商业周刊》的文章中，库克描述了成为同性恋是如何影响他的 ： “ 我是同性恋，我骄傲，我认为成为同性恋是上帝赐予我的最大礼物。	In his Bloomberg Businessweek article, Cook describes how being gay has affected him: “I’m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.
尽管地理给了中国基于陆地、辐射南海的实力，但美国在南海没有领土主张，并在其余95%的世界海洋地带拥有海上支配权。	And while geography gives China land-based power projection over the South China Sea, the US has no territorial claims there and enjoys naval supremacy over the remaining 95% of the world’s oceans.
发达国家逐渐堆积的债务（其实早就在迅速增长，只不过最近这场大萧条将其推到了几乎无法维持的境地）就反映了类似的算计。	The build-up of public debt in industrial countries (which was rising briskly well before the Great Recession pushed it to near-unsustainable levels) reflects this kind of calculus.
政府了解选民的苦衷，但也知道提高教育质量绝非易事，因为提高质量要求政府的政策有实质而有效的改革，而改变现状是很多既得利益者不愿看到的。	Politicians feel their constituents’ pain, but it is hard to improve the quality of education, for improvement requires real and effective policy change in an area where too many vested interests favor the status quo.
这一假设成为全球在贸易规则领域具有广泛共识的一个基础，包括各国拥有或正在努力建立相对一致的产权保护规则。	This assumption underpinned a broad global consensus on trade rules, including the relatively consistent protection of property rights.
除减少债务外，智利还利用这笔额外收入补充了两项财政基金的资源： 衰退开始时，这两项基金总额累计超过220亿美元。	In addition to reducing debt, Chile used its additional revenues to increase the resources of two fiscal funds: when the recession began, there were more than $22 billion in assets in both funds.
我们需要的迅速进展要求大幅降低二氧化碳排放量，这可以通过增加开发和扩张更清洁、更高效的能源的投资实现。	The rapid progress that is needed will require major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, achieved through increased investment in the development and expansion of cleaner and more efficient energy.
参与全球价值链是另一种方法，这一“干中学 ” （ learn by doing）方法从本质上远远强于对外国竞争封闭市场。	Participating in global value chains is an alternative way to learn by doing that is potentially more powerful than closing markets to foreign competition.
皮克提说，过去几十年来资本回报有所上升，这是对的，但他对关心这一现象原因的经济学家之间的广泛争论所知太少。	Though Piketty is right that returns to capital have increased in the last few decades, he is too dismissive of the wide-ranging debate among economists concerning the causes.
最后，在美国，二战的逼近以及伴随而生的军工产品需求使得私人部门雇主开始以可接受的工资水平雇用长期失业者。	In the end, in the US, it was the approach of World War II and the associated demand for military goods that led private-sector employers to hire the long-term unemployed at wages they would accept.
在这方面，他与伟大的十七世纪苏格兰经济学家亚当·斯密英雄所见略同，斯密的著作也被贝克尔认为是对自己职业生涯影响最大的。	In this sense, he was very much in the tradition of the great eighteenth-century Scottish economist Adam Smith, whose writings Becker regarded as one of the greatest influences on his career.
麦肯锡（McKinsey）的新研究发现如今数字驱动的知识密集型商品占据了全球跨境贸易的整整50 % — —并且在以比传统贸易形式高1.3倍的速度增长。	A new study by McKinsey finds that digital-driven, knowledge-intensive goods today comprise a full 50% of total global cross-border trade – and are growing at least 1.3 times as fast as other types of trade.
最终，美国提供了75%的情报、监视和侦察（ISR ） ， 75%的空中加油和90%的定点情报 — — 毫无疑问贡献卓著。	In the end, the US delivered 75% of the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), 75% of air-to-air refueling, and 90% of the targeting intelligence – an indisputably significant contribution.
最重要的是，区块链技术有潜力去大幅减少 — — 或甚至消除 — — 那些可信中介机构（如大型银行）的存在价值。	Most important, blockchain technology has the potential to reduce substantially, or even eliminate, the value of being a trusted intermediary such as a large bank.
为了核野心，伊朗领导人可能已准备好人民“吃草，甚至挨饿 ” 。 但人们希望，伊朗饱受剥削的中产阶级不会向这种屈辱低头。	Iran’s leaders might be ready to let their people “eat grass and even go hungry” for the sake of their nuclear ambitions, but Iran’s squeezed middle class, one hopes, will not submit to such degradation.
事实上这个没人能回答的问题意味着，即使是奥巴马治下的美国，仍然好像斯大林时代的苏联或艾哈迈迪·内贾德统治下的伊朗一样，人民凭空“消失 ” ， 连审判过程都不必经过。	The fact that no one can answer this question yet means that even in Barack Obama’s America, as in Stalin’s Russia or Ahmadinejad’s Iran, people can simply be disappeared without trial.
最近的阿根廷也是如此：资本流入突然停止后，本币失去了一半价值，经济陷入衰退（万幸没有随之爆发全面金融危机 ） 。	It is also what happened to Argentina recently: after a sudden stop in capital flows, the local currency lost half of its value and the economy lurched into recession (mercifully, a full financial crisis did not follow).
比如，到2025年，知识工作的自动化 — — 软件和系统日益能够从事需要判断的人力任务 — — 将影响到1,900—2,900万工作岗位。	For example, the automation of knowledge work – the software and systems that are increasingly capable of performing human tasks that require judgment – could affect 19-29 million jobs by 2025.
但构建这样一个网络的基础所需的规则很显然必须遵循国际法，而东盟区域论坛会议的最终声明也清晰地反映了这一理念。	But the rule needed to form the foundation of such a network must obviously adhere to international law, and the ARF meeting’s final declaration clearly reflected this concern.
在防止问题发生这一方面，通过像修建防洪堤或提供医院和学校的防震标准这样简单的行动就可以挽救无数的生命。	On the preventive front, countless lives can be saved by simple actions such as flood-proofing coastlines, or strengthening earthquake codes for hospitals and schools.
但在纪念活动前，政府已禁止许多机动车上路行驶（按照车牌号码 ） 、 阻止特定的工厂开工并迫使某些企业临时搬出市区。	But, before the commemorations, the government had prohibited many cars from driving (based on their license-plate numbers), stopped selected factories from operating, and forced some firms to move out of the city temporarily.
但法国的债务/GDP之比将在今年年底上升到96 % ， 2012年为91 % 。 而意大利将达到135 % ， 2012年为127 % 。	Yet France’s debt/GDP ratio will rise to 96% by the end of this year, from 91% in 2012, while Italy’s will reach 135%, up from 127% in 2012.
美国将回到在2008年几乎让世界金融体系彻底崩溃 — — 也让美国损失了至少一年的GDP（超过20万亿美元 ） — —的安排上。	The US would return to the arrangements that brought the world’s financial system to the brink of complete collapse in 2008 – and caused the country to lose at least one year’s GDP (more than $20 trillion).
大萧条开始三年半时间内，美国总统赫伯特·胡佛的首要任务是平衡预算，并竭力恢复企业信心（但他的努力最终没有成功 ） 。	For three and a half years following the start of the Great Depression, US President Herbert Hoover’s top priority was to balance the budget, trying – but ultimately failing – to restore business confidence.
目前这场金融危机就是个完美的例子，因为对银行业监管不利，才导致如此众多的世界经济大国陷入到困境之中。	The current financial crisis offers a perfect example, as it was poor governance in the banking sector that brought so many of the world’s great economies to their knees.
由于存在选举人团制度，选民投票选举的对象是支持他们选项的党派积极分子（包括竞争者的朋友和盟友）选举人团，而不是直接为候选人投票。	Due to the Electoral College, voters cast their ballots not for a candidate but for a slate of electors – party activists, including friends and allies of the contender – who will support their choice.
发自纽黑文 — — 表面上看，美国贸易代表罗伯特·莱希泽尔（Robert Lighthizer）在3月22日发布的所谓对华301条款报告似乎已被办成了铁案。	NEW HAVEN – On the surface, United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer appears to have made an ironclad case against China in the so-called Section 301 report issued on March 22.
基于对不断提升的风险敏感性以及在新兴市场资产所遭遇的意外损失，投资者的鉴别能力有所增强，开始区分对待不同国家和行业部门。	In response to heightened sensitivity to risk and unanticipated losses on their emerging-market assets, investors have become more discriminating, differentiating among countries and sectors.
我们消费越多俄罗斯天然气，普京就有越多的钱投入军队现代化建设和“混合战争（hybrid warfare ） ” 之中，让俄罗斯可以利用非正规部队和网络武器来充实常规武装力量。	The more Russian gas we burn, the more money Vladimir Putin has for military modernization and “hybrid warfare,” when Russia augments conventional forces with irregular troops and cyber weapons.
其中许多人都专门点了德国总理安格拉·默克尔的名，认为她未能像其前任和导师赫尔穆特·科尔那样为欧洲树立一个长远的愿景。	Many have singled out German Chancellor Angela Merkel for failing to promote a vision of Europe similar to that of her predecessor and mentor, Helmut Kohl.
超常规货币政策催生了资产热潮，表现为股价飙升、纽约、伦敦、巴黎、里约热内卢和上海等经济中心的房价飞涨，令国内购房者望而却步。	Non-conventional monetary policies fueled an asset boom, with share prices soaring and property prices in economic hubs like New York, London, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, and Shanghai shutting out domestic purchasers.
但是没有人怀疑巴基斯坦一手遮天的军事情报系统在过去二十年里建立和支持了恐怖组织，以作为该国对印度和阿富汗政策的工具。	Yet no one doubts that Pakistan’s all-powerful military intelligence has, over the last two decades, created and supported terror organizations as instruments of Pakistani policy in Afghanistan and India.
此外，哈佛大学的杰弗里·弗兰克尔（Jeffrey Frankel）指出，监管者在今年数次提高保证金要求，使得借钱买股票更加困难。	Furthermore, as Harvard’s Jeffrey Frankel has pointed out, regulators increased margin requirements several times this year, making it harder to buy stocks with borrowed money.
其他菲律宾领导人 — — 包括阿基诺三世之母、在推翻马科斯后当选为总统的柯拉蓉·阿基诺（Corazon Aquino）在内 — — 只是口头反腐，而阿基诺三世直击腐败的根源。	Whereas other Filipino leaders – including Aquino’s mother, Corazon Aquino, who was elected president after Marcos’s overthrow – spoke out against corruption, Aquino has attacked it at its roots.
在31年的总理生涯中，李光耀打造了独特的政府制度，复杂而巧妙地将极权和民主、国家资本主义和自由市场相平衡。	During his 31 years as prime minister, Lee crafted a unique system of government, intricately balancing authoritarianism with democracy and state capitalism with the free market.
从执政之初开始，马克龙就需要承担真理和团结的职责，作为基督教哲学家保罗·吕格尔（Paul Ricoeur）的犀利读者，他提出了他的竞选焦点。	From the first hours of his term, Macron will have to apply himself to the task of truth and unity that, as a perceptive reader of the Christian philosopher Paul Ricoeur, he made the focus of his campaign.
当地违法行为已经引起了黑帮火拼以及层出不穷的管道偷油案件，这又进一步导致了大量石油泄漏事故并导致了造成大量人员死亡 — — 包括许多无辜受殃者 — — 的频繁爆炸事件。	Local lawlessness has led to gang warfare and persistent illegal tapping into the pipelines to steal oil, leading to further massive oil spills and frequent explosions that kill dozens, including innocent bystanders.
现在是时候评估哪里出了问题，以及这个国家可以 — — 而且必须 — — 做什么来防止再次出现不稳定。	Now is the time to assess what went wrong, and what the country can – and must – do to prevent instability from returning.
然而，当我们处在深渊的边缘时，我们很有必要重新审视我们关于贫穷孕育了冲突，而社会经济的发展必然会促进政治的稳定并且减少了诉诸暴力的想法的臆断。	Nevertheless, as we sit on the brink of the abyss, it is worth re-examining our assumptions that since poverty breeds conflict, socio-economic development must foster political stability and reduce recourse to violence.
事实上，哈佛大学肯尼迪学院的包容性安全研究所（Institute for Inclusive Security）跟踪观察了女性参与和平谈判时所造成的不同。	And indeed, the Institute for Inclusive Security at Harvard’s Kennedy School has tracked the differences women make as part of peace negotiations.
正如被谋杀的荷兰导演提奥·梵高和他的前辈英国小说家萨尔曼·拉什迪一样，威尔克斯被自由主义者和左翼指为以作品引发动荡局势。	Like murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh and the British novelist Salman Rushdie before him, Vilks was criticized by liberals and the left for causing unrest with his art.
你可以在YouTube的网站上搜索“Carl Sagan – Pale Blue Dot”时，你会看到这段，并能听到萨根亲口告诉我们，我们必须珍惜我们的世界，因为我们人类所生活的前提就是我们拥有这个“暗淡蓝点”	If you go to YouTube and search for “Carl Sagan – Pale Blue Dot,” you can see it, and hear Sagan himself telling us that we must cherish our world because everything humans have ever valued exists only on that pale blue dot.
与此相反，如果国际货币基金组织试图扮演各国汇率政策国际公断人的角色，那就将面临无法克服的实施以及接受问题。 国际货币基金组织的使命是以有意不扣除风险因素的条件提供财政援助。	By contrast, an IMF that attempted to act, say, as an international umpire of national exchange-rate policies would face insurmountable implementation and acceptance problems.
这一转变有可能动摇整个联盟，但日产管理者似乎认为这比被事实合并更好 — — 这也正是东京所传出的戈森阴谋。	This shift risks destabilizing the alliance, but Nissan managers appear to regard that as preferable to being subsumed in a de facto merger – which is what the stories emerging in Tokyo suggest Ghosn was plotting.
"因此，与其寻求一种欧洲同一性，还不如达成共同的教育目标以加强欧洲人对于作为其兄弟姊妹的""他人""的意识。"	"So, rather than embarking on a search for a European identity, we should agree on mutual educational objectives to increase the awareness of all Europeans of the ""others"" who are their brethren in Europe."
孟加拉国北部偏远地区布拉马普特拉河附近的德克霍拉（Deukhola）的一位农民尖锐地指出 ， “ 我们的生存就系于此 。 ”	As a rural villager from Deukhola, near the Brahmaputra River in remote northern Bangladesh, starkly put it: “Our survival depends on it.”
此外，今天的降息空间也比1987年要低，因为当时联邦基金利率超过6 ％ ， 大银行的最优惠利率高于9 ％ 。	Moreover, there is less room to cut interest rates today than in 1987, when the fed funds rate exceeded 6% and the prime rate charged by big banks was above 9%.
花旗集团此举既证明了他们在华盛顿仍拥有政治实力，也表明他们想继续承担过多金融风险（这一特别立法变化允许这样做 ） 。	At a stroke, Citi executives demonstrated both their continued political clout in Washington and their continued desire to take on excessive amounts of financial risk (which is what this particular legal change permits).
但在2015年年底，中国总对外资产相对国际水平太低，仅相当于GDP的57.2 % ， 而日本和许多欧洲国家为180%左右，美国为130%左右。	At the end of 2015, China’s gross foreign assets were relatively low, at 57.2% of GDP, compared to about 180% for Japan and many European countries and around 130% for the US.

发自巴黎-刚刚落下帷幕的欧洲议会竞选活动在欧盟的27个成员国当中都有着相似的氛围，那就是选民、候选人和媒体都把主要焦点放在了各国的国内议题之上。	PARIS – In each of the 27 states of the European Union, the campaign for the just concluded elections for the European Parliament occurred in an atmosphere of indifference, with voters, candidates, and the media focusing mostly on domestic issues.
巴西众议院通过了真正的互联网“权利法案 ” ， 并由参议院一致批准，上周经总统罗塞夫签字生效。 公民社会支持者对这一结果十分满意。	Brazil’s House of Representatives has passed a genuine Internet “Bill of Rights,” which was unanimously approved by the senate and signed into law by President Dilma Rousseff last week – much to the delight of civil-society advocates.
否则，中国人民银行行长周小川说，中国将面临“明斯基时刻 ” ， 即在过度乐观和债务融资投资的高潮中迎来金融危机。	Otherwise, according to Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, the country might face a “Minsky moment,” in which excessive optimism and debt-financed investment culminate in financial crisis.
国际社会需要据此行动起来，加紧抵制、撤资和制裁，直到巴勒斯坦人可以在真正独立的国家中自由地与以色列共存。	The international community needs to respond accordingly, intensifying boycotts, divestments, and sanctions, until Palestinians are allowed to live freely in a truly independent state alongside Israel.
这些措施包括与省级政府合作 — — 省级政府承担着小学和中学教育的主要责任 — — 制定全民入学的路线图。	Those steps include cooperation with provincial governments – which bear the primary responsibility for primary and secondary education in Pakistan – to devise a roadmap for universal enrollment.
这一问题导致欧元区内部国家贸易极度不平衡，而南欧和法国庞大财政赤字和公共债务庞大，使这一问题更为复杂，原因很大部分要归咎于外国债权人。	The result has been large trade imbalances between eurozone countries, a problem compounded by large fiscal deficits and high levels of public debt in southern Europe (and France) – much of it owed to foreign creditors.
在两年前的三中全会上，中国领导人承诺要追求更深刻的改革，宣布市场必须“在资源配置中起到决定性作用 ” 。	Two years ago, at the Third Plenum, China’s leaders committed to pursue far-reaching reforms, declaring that markets must “play a decisive role in allocating resources.”
有人也许不确定什么构成性服务，加拿大司法部对该用语进行了有帮助的定义，其中包括了大腿舞，但不包括脱衣舞或“与产生色情有关的行为 ” 。	For those who are uncertain about what might constitute a sexual service, the term is helpfully defined by Canada’s Department of Justice to include lap-dancing, but not stripping or “acts related to the production of pornography.”
"例如，在2002年的弗吉尼亚一案中，高院裁定处决智障犯人是被《美国宪法》所禁止的""残酷而非常规的惩罚方式 "" 。"	"For example, in a 2002 Virginia case, the high court ruled that the execution of the mentally retarded is forbidden by the American Constitution as ""cruel and unusual punishment."""

真相是技术革命和亚洲消费的崛起 — — 而不是英国与欧盟的关系 — — 才是未来几十年推动营商方式改变的因素。	The truth is that it is the technological revolution and the surge in consumption in Asia – not the UK’s relationship with the EU – that will transform the way business is done over the next couple of decades.

我们相信即将在基加利召开会议的各国政府理解强势氢氟碳化物修正案的必要性，该修正案可以推动马拉喀什联合国可持续发展目标等其他议程项目。	We are confident that the governments preparing to meet in Kigali understand the need for a strong HFCs amendment, which would give momentum to other agenda items, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in Marrakesh.
现在恢复谈判的唯一希望就是“只有尼克松才能够打开中国大门”这一老观点，也就是只有一位真正坚定右翼领导人才有威信来与巴勒斯坦媾和。	The only hope now for resuming negotiations is the old “only Nixon could open up China” argument, meaning that only a truly hard-right Israeli leader would have the credibility to make peace with the Palestinians.
如果媒体渠道不为政府或民众所有或所用，媒体的记者编辑们就难以逃脱审查、恫吓、税务监察，有时甚至是暗杀的厄运。	When media outlets aren’t owned – and tamed – by the authorities or people close to them, they still face censorship, intimidation, tax audits, and occasionally assassination of their journalists and editors.
但更频繁出现的情况时是国家内部出现了大的变故 — — 政权无法实现经济增长，失去其合法性，人民开始设法转移到其他国家（或至少将资金转移出国 ） 。	But, more frequently, the big problems are internal – the regime cannot deliver growth, its legitimacy fades, and people start to head for the exits (or at least get their money out).
与此同时，政府应该采取进一步措施提振北部的教育和技能培训，同时也要授予地区和地方政府更大的决策自主权。	At the same time, the government should be pursuing further initiatives to boost education and skills-training in the north, while also devolving more decision-making authority to regional and local governments.
太阳能使植物吸收碳性气体并由此不仅制造氧气，还制造出其它物质—动物王国的食物和我们的机器所消耗的能源。	Solar energy enables plants to absorb carbon gas and thereby produce not only oxygen, but also matter that the animal kingdom uses for food – and that our machines can use for energy.
在经过近期在马萨诸塞州选举中的失败之后，由前美联储主席保罗 · 沃尔克起草的一份减少银行权限的报告，开始被重新重视起来。	That, in turn, allowed them to escape even the very weak special conditions that had been laid down by the government relating to bonuses and remuneration.
举例来讲，医疗保健行业可以与政府合作提供健康促进服务 — — 如远程病人监控、健康程序和患者求诊工具 — — 当然还有药物治疗。	For example, the health-care industry could work with governments to offer health-enhancing services – such as remote patient monitoring, health apps, and patient-engagement tools – in addition to medications.
意大利对欧盟有些合理的怨恨：不平等的伪善的庇护和海洋资源政策、适得其反的财政规则，以及缺乏经济常识的金融政策。	Italy has legitimate grievances against the EU: hypocritical and inequitable policies on asylum and sea rescues, self-defeating fiscal rules, and economically illiterate financial policies.
过去近20年来 ， “ 四方 ” — —联合国、美国、欧盟和俄罗斯 — — 都同意，巴勒斯坦权力机构和以色列政府应该以两个相互分离的共存国家身份实现和平。	It is almost two decades since the “quartet” – the UN, the United States, the European Union, and Russia – agreed that the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government should establish peace by coexisting as two separate states.
但该命令本身可能涉嫌违法；在联邦法院考虑这一问题时，起诉将继续进行，而且让被拆散家庭团聚还没有任何计划。	But that order itself may be illegal; while a federal court considers the issue, prosecutions will continue, and there is no plan in place for reuniting families that have already been divided.
不幸的是，当前关于气候工程的争论不是民主讨论，而是被技术官僚世界观、自然科学和工程思维，以及化石燃料业的既得利益所主导。	Unfortunately, current debates about climate engineering are undemocratic and dominated by technocratic worldviews, natural science and engineering perspectives, and vested interests in the fossil-fuel industries.
俄罗斯的主要战略目标是，作为反对俄罗斯的军事联盟的北约的削弱，或者甚至后退，并且重新建立其在东欧和中亚的势力范围。	Moscow’s main strategic objective is the weakening or even roll-back of NATO as an Ant-Russian military alliance and the re-establishment of its East European and Central Asian zones of influence.

苹果公司的iPhone发布于2007年，谷歌的Android手机发布于2008年，都赶上了危机的起点，但它们在此后持续增长。	Apple’s iPhone was launched in 2007, and Google’s Android phones in 2008, just as the crisis was beginning, but most of their growth has been since then.
一条早已为人所知的原理是税收和支出的平衡扩张能刺激经济，如果有一个设计良好的计划（对尖端人士征税，并增加教育方面的支出 ） ， GDP和就业将能有巨大改善。	A long-recognized principle is that balanced expansion of taxes and spending stimulates the economy; if the program is well designed (taxes at the top, combined with spending on education), the increase in GDP and employment can be significant.
而将外国影响与一场合法性反腐运动相结合将损害这一积极动力，也可能对中国实施增长模式转型及实现高收入状态的目标带来严重的潜在后果。	Lumping outside influences together with a legitimate anti-corruption campaign would undermine this positive dynamic, with potentially serious consequences for China’s quest to transform its growth model and achieve high-income status.
随着这种趋势的加剧，经济学家和市场参与者需要对挑战性状况下传统经济和金融政策制定的隐性权衡进行更加深入的思考和密切沟通。	As this trend intensifies, economists and market participants need to think harder about, and communicate much better, the implicit tradeoffs of conventional economic and financial policymaking under challenging circumstances.
但就算人们不共事，将世界带入每个人的起居室（或茅舍）的全球化，也使他们能够将自己的生活水平进行更为广泛的比较。	But even when people do not work together, globalization, by bringing the world to everyone’s living room (or hut), enables them to make much wider comparisons of their living standards.
这表明，E-RISC报告的发现和所使用的方法对传统主权风险分析带来了附加值，因为它们提供了对相关但目前未加解释的参数的洞察。	This suggests that the findings and methodologies applied in the E-RISC project bring added value to traditional sovereign-risk analysis, by providing insights into relevant but currently unaccounted-for parameters.
智利，尽管其自身机构也能力不俗，却转向第三方波士顿咨询集团，以确保能客观地挑选出那些最有前途的行业。	Chile, despite possessing reasonably strong institutions, turned to a third party, the Boston Consulting Group, to ensure that the most promising sectors were selected objectively.
当专家们忙着试图解释毛派主义者史无前例的胜利的时候，人民把希望寄托在了新近当选的有601个席位的议会成员上。	While experts are busy trying to explain the Maoists’ unprecedented triumph, much hope rests on the newly elected members of the 601-seat Constituent Assembly.
据佩尔米诺夫介绍， Roscosmos 的方案不是想摧毁这颗小行星，而是想利用物理学法则改变它的轨道。	According to Perminov, the proposals that Roscosmos is considering do not envision trying to destroy the asteroid, but rather to use the laws of physics to change its path.
以个人贡献为基础的保险权益体系正日益取代国家卫生和养老制度，这项变革意义深远，但在过渡期内却带来了不少问题。	Insurance-based systems of entitlements created by personal contributions are increasingly taking the place of national health and pension services. This is a profound change that creates much friction in the transitional phase.
在与欧盟领导人就移民问题争论数周后，政府现在正在挑战《马斯特里赫特条约》的规则，而这一切都是为了维护自身的民望。	After spending weeks arguing with EU leaders about migration, the government is now challenging the Maastricht Treaty’s rules, all in an effort to maintain popular support.
功利原理要求调查和论证，但边沁认为主张这些先验权利的人蔑视调查和论证，并且更有可能鼓动人们使用暴力。	Whereas the principle of utility calls for inquiry and argument, Bentham believes that those who advocate such pre-existing rights disdain both and are more likely to stir people up to use force.
用占GDP比重衡量，住房投资仍处在历史低点，这是2003—2008年房地产泡沫期的过度建房以及随后按揭止赎风暴带来的后果。	Residential investment is still at an historic low as a share of GDP as a result of overbuilding during the 2003-2008 housing boom and the tsunami of foreclosures that followed.
可是，假定我们能克服爱尔兰选民所设置的障碍，经验也表明布鲁塞尔日益发展的集权和各成员国在权力上的撤退将会成为欧盟未来发展的标志。	But, assuming that the obstacle thrown up by Ireland’s voters can be overcome, experience has shown that the EU’s future evolution will be marked by increasingly centralized power in Brussels and the retreat of individual states.
克鲁格曼的争议结论则是，即使真的发生这一幕，利率也不会上升，同时贬值对美国经济将具有扩张效应（通过增加净出口 ） 。	Krugman’s controversial claim is that, even if this were to happen, interest rates would not rise, while the depreciation’s effect on the US economy would be expansionary (via an increase in net exports).
相反，民粹主义者当权的特点是只关注自己的目标客户（其余人完全不配得到关注 ） 。 这些人更乐于使用强硬手段，而不是制衡之术。	Rather, what is distinctive about populists in power is that they attend only to their clientele (the rest of the population is utterly undeserving) and ride roughshod over checks and balances.
内塔尼亚胡的利库德集团的主要反对者 — — 犹太复国主义联盟（Zionist Union）将焦点主要集中于住房、高生活成本和日益加剧的经济不平等性等国内问题。	The Zionist Union, the principal opponent of Netanyahu’s Likud party, focused mostly on domestic issues like housing, the high cost of living, and growing economic inequality.
尽管面临数据问题，一个由哥本哈根共识（Copenhagen Consensus）召集的诺贝尔奖得主组成的小组仍将这些措施列为最值得追求的19项发展目标之一每一美元投入能够产生价值超过15美元的收益。	Despite data problems, a panel of Nobel laureates convened by Copenhagen Consensus identified such measures as one of the 19 best development targets to pursue, with every dollar spent producing benefits worth more than $15.
我怀疑基于这些思想的就职演说是否能够在毕业典礼上震撼和激发大量听众，特别是当许多听众是其他国家的公民的时候。	I doubt that an inaugural address based on these ideas will awe and inspire many audiences at commencement ceremonies, especially where many of those in attendance are citizens of other countries.
而对于塞巴斯蒂安·利佩（Sebastian Leape）这位最近几周都在营地里度过的志愿者来说，这些资金究竟都到哪里去了是他最想探究的问题。	Where exactly past funds have gone is now the subject of searching questions by Sebastian Leape, a volunteer who spent recent weeks in the camp.
从非金融企业的资产负债表来看，从1995年至2014年间投资利润比逐步下降，而巴西，马来西亚，韩国和土耳其等地的下降趋势尤其剧烈。	Judging by non-financial firms’ balance sheets, investment-to-profit ratios decreased from 1995 to 2014, with especially steep declines in Brazil, Malaysia, South Korea, and Turkey.
去年，在所有通过大学入学考试的学生中，女生占了60 % ， 在传统上男生占绝大多数的专业（如工科 ） ， 女生的表现也极为出色。	Last year, women made up 60% of all students passing university exams, and women have done well in traditionally male-dominated disciplines like engineering.
这一亲欧洲的公关只是关心如何最好地向欧洲公民“兜售”欧盟。 但是，如果没有能够兜售自己的愿景，那时不可能的。	But PR won’t work unless there is a vision that ultimately sells itself.
其中一个例子就是人们在很长一段时期后才认识到那些似乎是惰性且无害的卤代碳氢化合物原来正在破坏地球臭氧层。	One example is the belated recognition that seemingly inert and benign halogenated hydrocarbons were interfering with the ozone layer.
巴西的罗塞夫被弹劾，以及她的失败的经济政策被承认财政债务和赤字无法永远增长的方针所取代，则有可能代表巴西的转折点。	So did the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff in Brazil, and the replacement of her failed economic policies with an approach that recognizes that fiscal debts and deficits cannot keep growing forever.
于是他们携手建立了一套安全联盟、多边体制和经济政策相对开放的系统，这套系统由美式和平或“自由国际秩序”构成。	Together, they created a system of security alliances, multilateral institutions, and relatively open economic policies that comprise Pax Americana or the “liberal international order.”
贪婪的贷方进而推出了负摊销贷款（negative amortization loans ） ， 从而使借款人的负债连年攀升。	Predatory lenders went further, offering negative amortization loans, so the amount owed went up year after year.
比如，1846年英国废除谷物法有利于国际贸易中的自由市场，也加速了第一次世界大战爆发前的全球化进程。	For example, the repeal of the Corn Laws in the UK in 1846 favored a free market in international trade and accelerated globalization until the outbreak of World War I.
在更发达的经济体（如美国和欧洲 ） ， 众多机构投资者 — — 他们往往专注于长期基本面 — — 有助于稳定股市。	In more developed economies, such as the United States and Europe, many institutional investors – who tend to be focused on long-term fundamentals – help stabilize stock markets.
纽约—美国总统奥巴马提名金辰勇为世界银行行长之举受到了广泛好评 — — 理应如此，特别是其他提名也已昭告天下之时。	NEW YORK – US President Barack Obama’s nomination of Jim Yong Kim for the presidency of the World Bank has been well received – and rightly so, especially given some of the other names that were bandied about.
美国国会即将起草完成一项法案，计划新组建一个涵盖整个金融系统的委员会，并授权其处理和美国各大财政机构有关的解救方案。	The United States Congress is about to finalize a bill that will grant resolution authority over major US financial institutions to a newly formed systemic council.
看过日本海啸的镜头之后，想像的难度已经大大降低 — — 只有一点，我们必须想像没有日本修建的海啸防波堤会是什么样子。	Now that we have seen the footage of the tsunami that hit Japan, the demands on our imagination have been lessened – except that we have to imagine away the sea walls that Japan had built to reduce the impact of the tsunami.
在十七世纪，经济学家和投资者威廉·佩蒂爵士（Sir William Petty）领受了一个任务：去爱尔兰丈量大片（其中大部分闲置）的军队土地。	In the seventeenth century, the economist and investor Sir William Petty was tasked with surveying large swaths of army land, much of which lay fallow, in Ireland.
路德维希·艾哈德（Ludwig Erhard）的自由经济方案起效了，社会学家的观点出现在社会民主党的计划中，而基督民主党被彻底忘却。	Ludwig Erhard’s liberal economic approach worked and the socialist ideas found in the party programs of the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats were forgotten.
相反，曾在1936年西班牙、1953年伊朗、1973年智利、1980年土耳其、1989年苏丹和1992年阿尔及利亚和塔吉克斯坦上演的戏码却往往导致军事独裁、内战或两者兼而有之。	On the contrary, that pattern – seen in Spain in 1936, Iran in 1953, Chile in 1973, Turkey in 1980, Sudan in 1989, and Algeria and Tajikistan in 1992 – usually leads to military dictatorships, civil wars, or both.
但是，如果说投票人数之多是来自此次伊拉克大选的好消息（虽然与其说是对民主持有信念，还不如说是基于公利与私利的考虑 ） ， 那么坏消息就是，他们所选择的这个政权，也并非具有民主思想的政权。	But if high turnout, albeit based more on communal self-interest than belief in democracy, was the good news from Iraq’s election, the bad news is the leadership they chose, which is not democratically minded.
这意味着我们不应将经济与社会视为僵化的层级或机械式运作的市场，而应将其视作一个网络体系或生命网络，而存在于其中的合约，不管是正式还是非正式，履行了还是违反了，都是人类活动的根本。	This means that we should view the economy and society not as rigid hierarchies or mechanical markets, but as networks or webs of life, in which contracts, formal and informal, fulfilled or violated, are the essence of human activity.
此外，与饱受战争摧残的利比亚人相比，外来工人甚至更加脆弱，因为他们被排除在以保护公民为目的的政策之外。	And, while Libyans were badly affected by the war, foreign workers were even more vulnerable, as they were largely left out of schemes aimed at protecting civilians.
价格水平不太可能下降，然而，为规避商业周期导致的中期风险，人们持有资产的渴望完全掩盖了上述远期基础风险因素。	The price levels are unlikely to go down. Yet the desire to hold assets that avoid the medium-term risks associated with the business cycle has overwhelmed this long-run fundamental risk factor.
甚至优质学校也存在学生所需要的技能 — — 如批判性思维和解决问题的能力 — — 与他们学到的东西之间的断层。	Even good schools exhibit a gap between the skills students need – like critical thinking and problem solving – and what they are being taught.
1974年初，爱德华·希思（Edward Heath）的保守党内阁跟势力很大的煤炭工会为了“谁统治英国”而缠斗不休。	In early 1974, Edward Heath’s Conservative government was locked in a struggle with the powerful coal miners’ union over “who rules Britain.”
但自1900年以来，这方面的收益不可谓不巨：1900年全世界寿命预期为32岁，如今为69岁（2050年的预测值是76岁 ） 。	Yet it is difficult to overstate the magnitude of the gain since 1900: in that year, life expectancy worldwide was 32 years, compared to 69 now (and a projection of 76 years in 2050).
从拯救世界的角度讲，可持续发展鼓励用全面的视角审视人类福利，这一视角囊括了经济进步、强大的社会联系和环境可持续性。	As a method of helping to save the world, sustainable development encourages a holistic approach to human well-being, one that includes economic progress, strong social bonds, and environmental sustainability.
当然，科学家在上述领域所用的研究工具 — — 包括研究大脑愉悦中心的高科技成像到微观经济学的幸福方程式 — — 都还没有得到过证实。	Of course, the tools that scientists are using – from advanced imaging to examine the brain’s pleasure centers to microeconomic happiness equations – are not proven in this area.
为近期朝鲜半岛局势发展做出最大贡献的韩国总统文在寅无意之中强化了这种误解，因为他将与金正恩的首脑会晤归功于特朗普对朝鲜的“最大压力”政策发挥了作用。	South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in, who deserves the most credit for recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, unwittingly stoked this misperception by attributing his summit with Kim to Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” on the North.
国际刑警组织成员国包括世界某些最具压迫性的政府，其领导人经常滥用国内的刑事司法体系来遏制言论自由和政治反对。	Interpol’s members include some of the world’s most oppressive governments, whose leaders routinely misuse their own criminal justice systems to silence free speech and political opposition.
有篇文章的标题是“美联储与风险的无谓调情 ， ” 之后是连篇累牍的警告量化宽松可能“加大金融领域的不稳定性 ” 。	The article’s headline, “The Fed’s Needless Flirtation With Danger,” is followed by warnings that quantitative easing could “increase the risk of financial instability.”
至于美国，在这一情景中，特朗普政府继续追求大大削弱潜在增长的贸易方针 — — 包括一边倒地有利于富人的减税、贸易保护主义和移民限制。	As for the US, the Trump administration, in this scenario, continues to pursue a policy approach – including a tax cut that overwhelmingly favors the rich, trade protectionism, and migration restrictions – that may well reduce potential growth.
蒋介石（Chiang Kaishek）无从选择而不得不以德报怨，放弃要求日本赔偿并秘密安排关东军的前主要人物加入台湾与共产党的对抗活动。	Chiang Kaishek had no choice but to return good for evil by abjuring compensation claims on Japan, as well as by secretly arranging for the Kwantung Army’s ex-Chief of Staff to join Taiwan’s efforts in confronting the Communists.
发自剑桥 — — 今年是美国两项重大经济政策制度创新的100周年纪念：开征联邦收入所得税以及成立美联储。	CAMBRIDGE – This year marks the 100th anniversaries of two distinct institutional innovations in American economic policy: the introduction of the federal income tax and the establishment of the Federal Reserve.
（自从2005年7月，中国开始上调汇率以来，大多数专家认为，调整的额度要么是需要值的一半，要么超出。	(Since it began revaluing its exchange rate in July 2005, the adjustment has been half or more of what most experts think is required.)
例如，当央行发现某些特殊领域，例如房地产或是消费信贷等领域出现经济过热现象，它就应该对商业银行与此相关领域的信贷作出限制。	For example, we had no financial crises when central banks instructed commercial banks to limit their lending to particular economic sectors that they believed were overheating, such as real estate or consumer loans.
事实上，建设强大、公平的经济的整个过程不但应该致力于改善当下的公民生活；也必须为法国的未来打下基础。	Indeed, the entire process of building a strong and equitable economy should aim not just to improve citizens’ lives today; it must also prepare France for the future.
由于它是一场经济危机，多数人都不自觉地从经济学家那儿开始挖它的学术根子。 除了一些例外，经济学家的公信力大打折扣。	Since it is an economic crisis, most people seeking its intellectual roots are tempted to begin with economists, who, with a few exceptions, look particularly discredited.
然而对一个统治者的真正考验并不是盲从于人民的期望，而是放眼未来，并将国家的雄心与其需求和实力契合起来。	Yet the true test of a ruler is not to pander to his people’s expectations, but to peer into the future and match the country’s aspirations with its needs and capacities.
尽管从原则上说，信息革命能够遏制大国实力，增加小国和非国家行动者的实力，但政治和权力比技术所能决定的程度更复杂。	While the information revolution could, in principle, reduce large states’ power and increase that of small states and non-state actors, politics and power are more complex than such technological determinism implies.
但如果鲁哈尼不下台 — — 或由另一位温和派取代他 — — 那么这些压力有望提供足够的掩护，让伊朗收回外交冒险主义并改革国内经济。	But if Rouhani retains the presidency – or another moderate takes his place – there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back Iran’s foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy.
而且，当尼泊尔渴望成为一个联邦民主共和国的时候，不同的团体对他们对其生活和资源有更多的控制的期望是很高的。	Moreover, as Nepal aspires to become a federal democratic republic, expectations are high among diverse groups for greater control of their lives and resources.

为了鼓励中国在催生缅甸民族和解的进程中担负起领导���的责任，国际社会必须让中国相信推动改革能够成为一个双赢的计划。	To encourage China to take the lead in fostering national reconciliation in Burma, the international community must convince China that pushing for reform and change can be a win-win proposition.
这部戏的第一幕发生在2013年的秋天，时任乌克兰总统亚努科维奇欺骗了欧盟及其领导人，拒绝签署一份长期策划的入盟协议。	The first act began in the fall of 2013, when then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych duped the European Union and its leaders by refusing to sign a long-planned association agreement.
lamp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 中国有大约1000家太阳热能公司，营业收入25亿美元，下属60万工人从事制造和安装工作。	·China has some 1,000 solar thermal energy firms, generating sales of $2.5 billion and employing 600,000 workers in manufacturing and installation.
博纳的辞职虽然被某些人视为为达成政府短期结算协议扫清了障碍，但实际只是凸显了任何“负责任”的共和党领导人只能有限度地控制党内越来越强的原教旨主义倾向。	Boehner’s resignation, though viewed by some as clearing the way for a short-term deal to fund the government, merely underscores the limited ability of any “responsible” Republican leader to control the party’s increasingly fundamentalist caucus.
虽然高院对该案的分析主要基于对国内因素的考虑，但法官们同时也援引了欧盟的一份法律纲要，其中描述了国际社会对这种做法的强烈反对。	While most of the Court's analysis focused on domestic considerations, the Justices also invoked a legal brief filed by the European Union that described the overwhelming disapproval of the practice in the world community.
反之，潜在的领导者可以学会更多软实力技巧的来源与局限性，这些技巧涉及情商、预见力和交流能力；他们还可习得硬实力层面的政治与组织技巧。	Potential leaders, in turn, can learn more about the sources and limits of the soft-power skills of emotional IQ, vision, and communication, as well as hard-power political and organizational skills.
但美联储的下一任领导人应该致力于确保美国失业率回落到现有的不可接受的高水平之下；高达7%甚至6%的失业率不应该是“难免”的。	But the next leader of the Fed should be committed to ensuring that America’s unemployment rate falls below its current unacceptably high level; an unemployment rate of 7% – or even 6% – should not be viewed as inevitable.
当然，如果中国的决策者当时能预料到现在在世界经济中已经发生了的情况的话，他们可能就不会那么严厉地遏制增长了。	Of course, if Chinese policymakers could have predicted what has now happened in the world economy, they might have been less stringent in trying to rein in growth.
他，像他所说的，走“到世界的尽头 ” （ 位于耶路撒冷的以色列国会 ） ， 并且通过这样的举动使这个地区的政治发生了翻天覆地的变化。	He had, as he put it, gone “to the end of the earth” (the Knesset in Jerusalem), and in doing so transformed the region’s politics beyond recognition.

小布什政府过分简单粗暴的民主实践在伊拉克和加沙地区都造成了恶果，加沙地区的选举甚至导致了敌对的哈马斯政府上台。	Simplistic endorsement of democracy by George W. Bush’s administration was costly both in Iraq and in Gaza, where elections gave rise to a hostile Hamas-led government.
在Facebook以及所有网络社区里，我通过发出一篇帖子并邀请“好友团”继续深入调查和讨论体验到了这种模式令人惊叹的巨大潜力。	On Facebook, of all places, I experienced the amazing potential of posting an item and then inviting my “community” to continue the research as well as the debate.
他的司法管理完全不能给普通人民带来安心；而由于被忽视和无人负责，俄罗斯的军事设施、潜艇、钻井平台、挖矿机、医院和养老院不断地萧条、崩溃和沉没。	His managed judiciary provides no comfort to ordinary people; and the country’s military installations, submarines, oilrigs, mining shafts, hospitals, and retirement homes regularly blow up, collapse, or sink, owing to neglect and zero liability.
一个重物（或者一只苹果！ ）的下落可以联系到月亮绕地球旋转的轨道甚至包含几十亿个太阳系的银河系的结构。	The fall of a weight (or an apple!) can be connected to the moon’s orbit around the earth and even to the structure of galaxies holding billions of solar systems.
毕竟平等机会主义者认为，如果每个人都有着相同的起点，那么一个不好的最终结果必然是源自于个人自己的失误。	After all, equal opportunists argue, if everyone begins at the same starting point, a bad outcome must be due to an individual’s own missteps.
但是，恢复后的中俄联姻总是更多的带有便利的味道 — — 事实上是为了制衡美国的霸权 — — 而不是真正的罗曼蒂克。	But that renewed Sino-Russian marriage always smacked more of convenience – aimed as it was at checking American hegemony – than of true romance.
巴克莱员工泄漏出来一段据称是博达文同英格兰银行副行长保罗·塔克（Paul Tucker）的谈话，其内容似乎意味着，是英格兰银行授意巴克莱虚报利率的。	His staff leaked the contents of a conversation he claimed to have had with Paul Tucker, a senior Bank of England official, suggesting that the BoE had told Barclays to report inaccurate interest-rate numbers.
但是，正如知名的石油问题历史学家耶金指出的那样，预言大难临头的预言家宣称世界石油耗尽已经至少有四次了。	However, as leading oil historian Dan Yergin points out, prophets of doom have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already.
目前科学家估计约有50%的气候变化是由二氧化碳以外的各种气体和污染物所导致的，其中包括一些氮化合物，由污染产生的低空臭氧以及炭黑。	Scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50% of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than CO2, including nitrogen compounds, low-level ozone formed by pollution, and black carbon.
大幅度缩减贸易赤字的惟一方法是进口净值下降，这就要求要么相对急剧地降低美元价值从而提高进口价格，要么美国出现经济萧条。	And the only way for the trade deficit to shrink substantially is for net imports to fall, which requires either a relatively sharp decline in the value of the dollar, thereby raising import prices, or a depression in the US.
你可以想象一下，20年后，如果我们可以给年青一代提供很好的教育，让他们掌握迎接重大经济和技术时代挑战的技能和创造力，世界将会变得怎样。	Imagine our world, 20 years from now, if we could educate a new generation of young people so that they have the skills and creativity to take on the great economic and technological challenges of the day.
由于议会中业已存在的僵局会削弱改革的可能性，导致公司延缓投资，而消费者则更有可能合拢钱包，因为官方政策比现在还要更加捉摸不定。	Because the expected gridlock in parliament would make reforms less likely, companies might hold off on investment, while consumers would be more likely to keep their wallets closed, because official policy would be even less clear than it is now.
拉各斯—既美联储关于其量化宽松（QE）政策的“收回之怒 ” （ taper tantrum）后，去年春天新兴市场金融动荡遭到了金融动荡的打击。	LAGOS – The financial turmoil that hit emerging-market economies last spring, following the US Federal Reserve’s “taper tantrum” over its quantitative-easing (QE) policy, has returned with a vengeance.
事实上，多元体系已经在中国共产党的名义下展开 — — 这一过程可能最终使公民在公共政策中的声音制度化。	In fact, a pluralistic system is already evolving under the umbrella of the Chinese Communist Party – a process that may eventually lead to citizens gaining an institutionalized voice in public policy.
与此同时，生产商品和服务然后出售，这些业务的价值相对而言有所下降，因为营销、广告和交易成为最主要的重点。	At the same time, the value of producing the good or service to be sold has diminished in relative terms, as marketing, advertising, and deal making have become top priorities.
研究表明政客和利益集团会利用全民就业支持代价昂贵的保护主义政策，在为部分人带来好工作的同时却让更多人进入非正式经济队伍。	Research suggests that politicians and interest groups would use a full-employment target to support expensive, protectionist policies that generate great jobs for some but drive many into the informal economy.
反过来，2008年俄罗斯又借口自决支持阿布哈兹脱离格鲁吉亚，并在2014年借口自决入侵并吞并克里米亚。	In turn, Russia invoked self-determination to support Abkhazia’s secession from Georgia in 2008, and its invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014.
从2011年一季度到2016年三季度，中国累计经常项目盈余为1.28万亿美元，而净外国资产下降了124亿美元。	From the first quarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2016, while China’s cumulative current-account surplus was $1.28 trillion, its net foreign assets fell by $12.4 billion.
更好的做法是保持工资的缓慢上升，从而让人们能够得到工作，同时寻找其他补贴教育和医疗的方法以满足有需要的人群。	It would be better to keep wage increases modest so that people get jobs and to look for other ways to subsidize education and health care for those who need such help.
温家宝最具争议的经济政策就是其政府为应对2008年金融危机所实施的4万亿人民币（约合5860亿美元）刺激计划。	Wen’s most contentious economic policy was the CN¥4 trillion ($586 billion) stimulus package that his government launched in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
根据非洲进步委员会（Africa Progress Panel）最新的年度报告 — — 《谷、鱼、钱 — — 为非洲的绿色和蓝色革命融资 》 （ Grain, Fish, Money – Financing Africa’s Green and Blue Revolutions ） ， 问题是显而易见的：形势不利于非洲农民。	According to the Africa Progress Panel’s latest annual report, Grain, Fish, Money – Financing Africa’s Green and Blue Revolutions, the problem is straightforward: the odds are stacked against Africa’s farmers.
欧元集团（由欧元区成员国财政部长组成）内的激烈争论不但制约了货币联盟各成员国之间的关系，还加剧了国家政府内部的紧张。	The bitter dispute within the Eurogroup (comprising the eurozone countries’ finance ministers) not only strained relations among the monetary union’s members, but also fueled tensions within national governments.
互联网让基于知识的服务 — — 如软件编程、工程与设计、医学筛查以及会计、法律和咨询工作 — — 能够在一瞬间实现跨境流动。	The Internet has also enabled instantaneous cross-border dissemination of knowledge-based services such as software programming, engineering and design, medical screening, and accounting, legal, and consulting work.
事实上，往返叙利亚的航班都没有中断，也没有其他任何措施争取让大马士革和阿勒颇的民众反对阿萨德政府和结束这��危机。	Indeed, there has been no stoppage of flights to and from the country, or any other measures that could tilt the population of Damascus and Aleppo against the regime and bring the crisis to an end.
事实上，他甚至激怒了美国，这一台湾唯一的军事保护者，因为他常常采取挑衅性的举动，如推动台湾迈向独立，而这是与美国长期坚持的“一个中国”的政策背道而驰的。	Indeed, he even angered the United States, Taiwan’s only military protector, by his frequent confrontational tactics, such as pushing Taiwan towards independence, which runs counter to America’s longstanding “One-China” policy.
安倍没有向伊斯兰国的要求屈服，而伊斯兰国的随后又放出了第二份视频，称汤川已被斩首。 汤川于去年8月被伊斯兰国抓住，据报道，当时他在叙利亚准备成立一个设在日本的私人保安公司。	When Abe failed to bow to its demands, ISIL released a second video claiming that Yukawa, who was seized last August in Syria while reportedly preparing to establish a Japan-based private security company, had been beheaded.
但这些目标只有在欧盟解决自身金融危机、迎来可持续复苏并（也是最重要的）成为包融性经济体的情况下才能实现。 否则的话，欧盟将心安理得地把罗姆人当作替罪羊。	But these goals can be achieved only if the EU resolves its financial crisis, embarks on a sustainable recovery, and, above all, becomes an inclusive economy.Otherwise, Roma will inevitably serve as the EU’s convenient scapegoats.
以色列原教旨主义者认为我们其他人眼中技术进步和全球化的自由化影响反应出西方殖民主义不可一世的重新抬头。	Islamic fundamentalists reckon that what the rest of us regard as the liberalizing influence of technological progress and globalization is a brash re-run of Western colonialism.
但意大利的社会早已今非昔比：如今大部分女性都是职业女性，因此对贝卢斯科尼那套陈词滥调及其胡作非为的大男子主义失去了兴趣。	But Italian society has changed: most women are now working, and they are no longer willing to accept Belusconi’s anachronistic and outrageous chauvinism.
但它也必须面对来自国内农业利益集团的强硬反抗，而且后者为此动员的力量可能要比当年反对与美国签订自贸协定时更强大。	But it, too, will have to face strong opposition from domestic agricultural interest groups and manufacturing sectors, which might mobilize even more strongly than they did in opposing the FTA with the US.
不幸的是，许多被广泛使用的抗生素正在失去它们保护患者、治疗疾病的能力；一个关键原因是农业作业对抗生素的日常滥用。	Unfortunately, many widely used antibiotics are losing their ability to protect patients and treat disease; routine misuse of antibiotics in farming is a key reason why.
因此美国退出当前重启谈判的行为将明确传达一条信息：错误的行为不会被纵容，并将促使极度渴望和平的以色列人改变其政府的立场。	Withdrawal by the US from the current push to restart negotiations would send a clear message that bad behavior will not be tolerated, and would encourage Israelis, who overwhelmingly want peace, to force a change in their own government’s position.
平心而论，美军的存在仍然提供了大部分行动方都能共存的秩序；但也有可能将世界最大军事强国拖入琐碎的地区冲突，在1914年后一百年的今天，这一前景应该引起我们的警觉。	To be sure, the US military presence still imposes a certain order with which most parties can live; but it risks dragging the world’s largest military power into petty regional conflicts, a prospect that should alarm us one century after 1914.
联合国难民署和 国际救援委员会等国际组织和非政府机构，以及教皇弗朗西斯和坎特伯雷大主教等宗教界领袖也参与进来。	International organizations and non-governmental agencies such as the UNHCR and the International Rescue Committee, and religious leaders such as Pope Francis and the Archbishop of Canterbury, have weighed in as well.
其中一些，如丹麦人民党（People’s Party ） ， 希望效仿英国榜样举行欧盟成员资格公决。	Some, such as the Danish People’s Party, want to follow the United Kingdom’s lead and hold a vote on EU membership.
然而，下降的主要原因是世界人口的增加，而不是实际饥饿人数的略有减少（从大约9.8亿减少到今天的8.52亿 ） 。	However, this decrease owes more to a rise in the world’s population than it does to the slight reduction in the actual number of hungry people (from about 980 million to 852 million today).
那么，得知康多莉扎·赖斯－犯下这些罪行的罪犯之一，刚刚在联合国安理会领导了一个关于把性暴力作为战争武器的辩论，是多么的令人意外。	How extraordinary, then, to learn that one of the perpetrators of these crimes, Condoleezza Rice, has just led the debate in a special session of the United Nations Security Council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.
对其他问题的澄清也是必要的。 伊朗准备接受就欧洲和其他国家关于其核计划的担忧作出的妥协，从而取得广泛的经济、能源、技术和科学合作吗？	Other clarifications are also needed. Is Iran prepared to accept a compromise that responds to European and other international concerns about its nuclear program, and thereby gain wide-ranging economic, energy, technology and science cooperation?
总体而言，35个部长席位中改革派力量仅占10个左右，余下的则是旧政权人物和并未公开宣布政治背景的技术专家的组合。	Overall, only ten of the 35 ministries went to pro-change forces, with the other ministers a combination of old-regime figures and technocrats without any publicly declared political affiliation.
诚然，许多问题仍然存在，包括欧洲银行的疲软，中国地方政府的过度负债，以及美国金融监管的毫无必要的复杂程度。	True, many problems remain, including weak banks in Europe, over-leveraged local governments in China, and needlessly complicated financial regulation in the United States.
全世界最大的20个城市中有75%位于亚洲，到2025年，这20个城市预计将产生3,600万套新住房的需求。	The world’s 20 largest cities, 75% of which are in Asia, will need an estimated 36 million new housing units by 2025.
该法引起了严重的真实世界后果：在过去两年中，58位印度人根据刑法典第377条因为在家中进行私密活动而被捕。	The real-world consequences of this are jarring: In the last two years, 58 Indians have been arrested under Section 377 for acts carried out in the privacy of their homes.
莫伊只是我心目中一个虚构的人物，因为他并不住在Nairagie Enkare地区，但他经常在收音机里出现，而收音机这种高科技对一个孩子来说实在太难理解了。	Moi was a mythical figure to me, because he didn’t live in Nairagie Enkare, yet he was always present through radio, a technology too complicated for a child like me to understand.
柏林 — — 自2010年希腊债务危机伊始，欧洲主要国家就应该已经清楚它可能给欧盟带来什么样的风险和后果。	BERLIN – From the start of the Greek debt crisis in 2010, the major European players should have understood the risks and consequences that it posed for the European Union.
东京 — — 在十月初结束的第15次会议上，联合国人权理事会通过一项决议，鼓励政府消灭针对麻风病人及其家属的歧视问题。	TOKYO – At its 15th session, which ended at the beginning of October, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution encouraging governments to eliminate discrimination against people affected by leprosy – and their family members.
尽管捷克斯洛伐克通过“天鹅绒分离”和平地分为两个国家，这十分鼓舞人心，但是无论在欧洲还是其他地方，这种现象都不是常态。	However encouraging, Czechoslovakia’s peaceful “velvet divorce” into two states has not been the norm in Europe or elsewhere.
但是她却没有告诉我们，即使以高昂的代价大幅度减少排放，到2050年的时候对积雪融化的影响还是无法衡量。	What she fails to tell us is that even a substantial reduction in emissions – at a high cost – will have an immeasurable effect on snowmelt by 2050.
到2020年，肯尼亚和坦桑尼亚两国可再生迷你电网接入数量预计将从12,000座增肌到145,000座。	By 2020, the number of renewable mini-grid connections in these two countries is expected to climb from 12,000 to more than 145,000.
农村迷你电网常常需要在没有金融支持的条件下展开（而大电厂总能获得金融支持 ） ， 尽管它们所提供的服务不亚于大电厂。	Rural mini-grids are often required to operate without the financial backing that larger utilities regularly receive, despite providing equivalent or better service.
尽管这一威胁处于科学家直接控制范围之外，但改善与政治领袖和公众的沟通有助于减少错误信息、提振对科学的信心。	Although such threats are outside of scientists’ direct control, improved communication with political leaders and the public could help to reduce misinformation and bolster confidence in science.
而在实际操作中，拯救银行的行为依然由各国政府主导，所有的国家都是被“自己的”银行困扰但援助的能力就大不相同：法国和德国的银行将被拯救；塞浦路斯的银行就没那么好运了。	In practice, then, rescuing banks will remain in the hands of national governments, all of which are captured by “their” banks but whose capacity to bail them out varies: French and German banks will be rescued; Cypriot banks will not.
但是，和英国人和美国人不同，日本人的崛起是不光彩的，是通过大量向美国出口以及不公平地将美国货排除在其本身国内市场之外实现的。	But, unlike the British or the Americans, the Japanese allegedly were gaining ground in nefarious ways, exporting aggressively to the US and unfairly excluding US exports from their domestic market.
在我看来，对于这个有着上千年的历史和已经被世界上150多个国家承认的国家而言，要求巴勒斯坦人的承认显然是多此一举。	In my opinion, it is superfluous to ask the Palestinians to recognize the nationhood of a people with thousands of years of history and a state that maintains diplomatic relations with 150 countries around the world.
剑桥 — — 目前，关于“总量管制和排放交易”在国际间被广泛接受，很有可能引发新一轮的贸易保护主义。 而且在近期乃至将来对经济造成非常不好的影响。	CAMBRIDGE ­– There is a serious danger that the international adoption of cap-and-trade legislation to limit carbon-dioxide emissions will trigger a new round of protectionist measures.
而缺少全欧范围内统一的财政政策导致在大规模紧急援助后突然面对巨额不良债务时，欧洲央行自身的融资渠道还存在很大的不确定性。	And the absence of a Europe-wide fiscal policy creates significant uncertainty about how the European Central Bank would finance itself if it suddenly faced large losses on junk bank debt after a big bailout.
对一个超级巨星来说（他甚至经常出现在主要刊物的封面上 ） ， 费舍尔的生活可谓穷困潦倒，如今，他终于坐在了价值250,000美元的对局边上。	After a lifetime of living in relative poverty for a superstar (even though he frequently appeared on the cover of major magazines), Fischer finally found himself playing in a match with a $250,000 purse.
相反，我们认为历史学家会将注意力集中在“奥巴马医保”如何鼓励了逐渐控制一个功能失调的系统的不断上升的成本的创新上，即使它让数百万此前被排除在外的美国人也获得了医疗保险。	Instead, we think that they will focus on how “Obamacare” encouraged a wave of innovation that gradually tamed the spiraling costs of a dysfunctional system, even as millions of previously excluded Americans gained access to health insurance.
上述病例对普遍的用血安全都有着重要的意义。 它们表明要加强对献血者的条件限制，以及改善对血液和血液制品的加工处理。	These cases have major implications for blood safety everywhere, implying additional restrictions on eligibility for blood donation and on the processing and handling of blood and blood products.
在以色列方面，您和沙龙单方面决定与你们自己的意识形态背道而驰并且毅然撤出犹太人定居点，从而展示了你们对政治进程的信仰。	On the Israeli side, your faith in the political process was demonstrated recently when you and Sharon decided unilaterally to go against your own ideology and take on the powerful settler movement.
而且鉴于他要等到10月才会宣判，所以不能认为他已经面临严厉的惩戒（这是美国开国元勋们所担心的关键问题 ） 。	And, given that he was not to be sentenced until October, one cannot argue that he faced draconian punishment (a key concern for America’s founders).
今天，美国医疗业绝大部分均为利润驱动，从研发什么样的药品到谁能获得保险的几乎所有决策无不体现这一核心宗旨。	Today, most of the US health-care industry is profit-driven, and this is reflected in nearly every decision, from which drugs get developed to who gets insured.
粮食损失 — — 在地头、在加工过程中、在运输期间、在市场交易中 — — 威胁着大部分发展中国家的粮食安全，收获后损失可能高达产量的40 % 。	Food loss – on farms, during processing, transport, and at markets – undermines food security in most developing countries, where post-harvest losses can reach as high as 40% of production.
伦敦—新闻学教室中也许大部分是女性，但全球媒体仍然由男性主宰，他们占据了大部分管理岗位，报道更多新闻，也更常代表专业声音发声。	LONDON – Journalism classrooms may be dominated by women, but global media are still ruled by men, who occupy the majority of management positions, report more news stories and are more frequently presented as expert voices.
但十月下旬，欧盟成员国商定了2030年 气候与能源全新政策框架 — — 该框架与 欧盟2020年气候与能源一揽子计划相似，缺乏赖以存在的坚实的基础。	Yet, in late October, EU member states agreed on a new policy framework for climate and energy for 2030 – one that, like the EU’s 2020 climate and energy package, lacks a solid foundation.
这些专业人士以其取得的成就而自豪，而且甚至可能得到崇拜成功而不问成功之道的美国公众的尊敬。 这一事实让人们对卡尔波普的开放社会的概念产生怀疑。	These professionals take pride in their ac­complishments, and may even enjoy the respect of an American public that admires success no matter how it is achieved.
比如，为了确保所有工作30年或以上的人都不会在晚年致贫，社会安全需要提高低收入工人的最低福利，而较丰裕的年长者，其长期福利的增加幅度将会更少。	For example, to ensure that no one who has worked for 30 or more years will live in poverty in old age, Social Security needs a higher minimum benefit for lower-income workers, with more affluent seniors seeing less growth in benefits over time.
在经历了几十年的高增长和成功政策实验后，周期性超调 — — 体现在过剩产能、鬼城和地方债务积压等现象上 — — 已见怪不怪。	After decades of high-speed growth and policy experimentation, cyclical overshoots – reflected in excess capacity, ghost towns, and local-debt overhangs – are no surprise.
在去年四月的一个采访中，德尔纳地区的安萨尔·沙里夫组织指挥官，前关塔纳摩监狱囚犯苏菲安·本·库目（Sufian bin Qumu）说 ： “ 没有人叫我们加入军队或警队 ” ， “他们甚至没有给我或我的部下一点参加战斗的报酬 。 ”	“Nobody asked us to join the army or the police,” Sufian bin Qumu, Ansar al-Shariah’s commander in Derna and a former Guantánamo detainee, said in an interview last April. “They did not even give me or any of my men a reward for fighting.”
"从拉丁美洲国家抵达美国要比从欧洲或亚洲抵达美国容易得多。 这得""感谢""拉丁美洲的运输量、航班数量、相对松弛的出关控制以及不够严密的边境。"	Access to the US from many countries in Latin America is much easier than from Europe or Asia, owing to the volume of traffic, the number of flights, the comparative laxity of exit controls, and the porousness of borders.
消除补贴和贸易壁垒意味着资源将会更为有效地得以利用，就会有更多的手段来减少不平等和贫困、社会紧张关系、环境破坏、营养不良以及疾病。	Eliminating subsidies and trade barriers would mean that resources could be used more efficiently, so there would be more scope to reduce inequality and poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, malnutrition, and disease.
伟大的古巴裔美国经济史家卡洛斯·迪亚兹-亚历杭德罗（Carlos Díaz-Alejandro）指出：	As Carlos Díaz-Alejandro, the great Cuban-American economic historian, put it:
比如，如果希腊（或任何国家）为了缓冲重获竞争力所需要的极端工资下调压力以及避免过快减债所造成的严重社会动荡而退出欧元区将会怎样？	For example, how would Greece (or any country) exit the euro in order to cushion the extreme downward wage adjustment required to regain competitiveness, and to avoid the severe social unrest that could result from reining in debt too rapidly?
如果布什和施罗德现在要向世界展示他们如何融洽相处，那不是因为他们正准备一个新开始，而是因为那符合他们的战略利益。	If Bush and Schroeder are now showing the world how well they get along together, it is not because they are off to a new start, but because it suits their tactical interests.
东京—4月13日上午7:39，顶着几乎全体国际社会的反对之声，朝鲜发射了一枚导弹（他们称之为卫星 ） 。	TOKYO – At 7:39 a.m. on April 13, North Korea fired a missile (which it called a satellite launch) in the face of opposition from almost the entire international community.
虽然这种让步尚未全部达成，越来越多的人承认它将赋予都柏林巨大的喘息机会，从而举行一次更有效的二次复决。	Although this concession is not yet a done deal, there is increasing acknowledgment that it would give Dublin considerable breathing space to conduct a more effective second referendum campaign.
现在的激烈冲突在很大程度上是由于法塔赫在国际社会联合抵制哈马斯的形势鼓励下从未真正接受自己在选举中的失败和哈马斯的统治权。	The current flare-up is largely due to the fact that Fatah, encouraged by the international community’s boycott of Hamas, never really accepted its electoral defeat and Hamas’s right to govern.
对外直接投资在2009年继续增至570亿美元，而同期的全球直接外资额锐减50 % ， 令中国成为全世界第五大对外投资国。	Outflows continued to rise to $57 billion in 2009, a time when global FDI flows had collapsed by 50%, making China the world’s fifth largest outward investor.
墨尔本—上个月，教皇方济各在从菲律宾返回罗马途中向记者说了一位女性的故事。 这位女性通过剖腹产生了七个孩子，现在又怀上了第九个。	MELBOURNE – As Pope Francis was returning to Rome from the Philippines last month, he told journalists about a woman who had had seven children by caesarean section and was now pregnant again.
同样，由于新成员国在给予私有产业的银行信贷方面也远低于西欧成员国的平均水平，贷款活动还有很大的发展空间。	Similarly, with bank credit to the private sector in the new members well below averages in the West, the scope for increasing lending activity is also substantial.
这将减轻欧洲央行的政策负担。 目前，欧洲央行被迫追求多重宏大目标，这远远超过了其保证增长、就业、通胀和金融稳定的持续好结果的能力。	This would ease the policy burden on the ECB, which is currently being forced to pursue multiple ambitious objectives that far exceed its capacity to deliver sustainably good outcomes regarding growth, employment, inflation, and financial stability.
在我的2003年的<<金融新秩序>>一书中，我提议把这样的单位称为“篮子 ” 。 这是因为消费者物价指数是具有代表性的商品和服务市场化篮子价格。	In my 2003 book The New Financial Order, I proposed that such units be called “baskets,” since a consumer price index is the price of a representative market basket of goods and services.
因此，世界脊髓灰质炎日是一次敦促政治家重申消灭脊髓灰质炎承诺的机会，并借此吸取全球根除脊髓灰质炎行动的经验，以改善世界各地的健康状况。	World Polio Day is thus an occasion to urge politicians to renew their commitments to polio eradication, and to apply lessons from the GPEI to improve health everywhere.
其银行业萎靡不振不但威胁到经济复苏、阻碍了投资，并且其银行业的麻烦尖锐地反映了一个影响到整个欧元区的问题。	Not only is its dysfunctional banking sector undermining economic recovery and inhibiting investment; the sector’s troubles are the sharp end of a problem that affects the entire eurozone.
然而谷歌和脸书使用的微型精准广告模式一方面搅乱了印刷新闻媒体的传统收入来源，另一方面也影响了国家和地方政府的信息发布方式。	And yet the microtargeted advertising model used by Google and Facebook has disrupted print journalism’s traditional source of revenue, along with coverage of state and local governments.
尽管民族主义情绪渐浓、互相怀疑之风日盛，中东欧国家也设法避免了冲突，这主要是因为它们很快地被北约和欧盟接受了。	Despite rising nationalist sentiments and mutual suspicions, Central and Eastern European countries also managed to avoid conflict, thanks to their rapid acceptance into NATO and the European Union.
贸易数据告诉我们：在2008年之前那十年，世界贸易以每年7%左右的速度增长，但在2009年其降速却快于全球GDP的降速（也比大萧条时期更剧烈 ） 。	Trade data tell the story: after increasing by about 7% annually in the decade before 2008, world trade fell faster than global GDP in 2009 (and more sharply than during the Great Depression).
我们计划迅速召集议会选举，这将比原计划中提前一年，以便用一届正常议会替代拉贾帕克萨的影子议会对政府进行监督。	We plan to quickly call a Parliamentary election, which will take place one year ahead of schedule, in order to replace Rajapaksa’s echo chamber with a fully functioning assembly, one that holds the government to account.
实现这些目标不仅能够改善数十亿人民的生活，还能将因贫困、饥荒和争夺稀缺资源而引发的暴力冲突扼杀于未萌。	Achieving these goals would not only improve the lives of billions of people, but would also forestall violent conflicts that are stoked by poverty, famine, and struggles over scarce resources.
所有这些行动方的背景、经济利益和观点各不相同，但它们都必须充分了解信息，参与到这场认识到未来一切复杂性和挑战的争论中。	Despite their varied backgrounds, economic interests, and points of view, all of these actors must engage in an informed debate that recognizes all of the complexities of the challenge ahead.
相反，美国和日本都面临着充分就业时财政赤字高于GDP的3%的情况 — — 大约比欧元区的水平高2—3个百分点。	By contrast, both the US and Japan are facing full employment with fiscal deficits higher than 3% of GDP – about 2-3 percentage points higher than those of the eurozone.
问题是当许多国家的贫困率也不断上升之时，高收入人群在经济大饼中占据的份额不断加大，而中等收入群体却未能从经济增长中获益。	The problem is not only that the top income groups are getting a larger share of the economic pie, but also that those in the middle are not sharing in economic growth, while in many countries poverty is increasing.
诸如韩国、台湾以及日本等其他的儒家社会，如今都已拥有繁荣的自由民主制度，人们没有理由相信：中国不可能经历这种转型。	Other Confucian societies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, now have thriving liberal democracies, and there is no reason to believe that such a transition is impossible in China.
尽管季莫申科在乌克兰处于领导角色，但是如果俄罗斯总统普京被一名女性所取代的话那会令人非常惊讶，而尽管中国有一个女性的副总理，但是没有迹象表明日本会很快出现一名女首相。	Despite Tymoshenko’s leading role in Ukraine, it would be surprising to see Russian President Vladimir Putin replaced by a woman, and, while there is a female vice-president in China, there is no sign of a woman becoming Japanese prime minister soon.
尽管民意调查一再显示犹太人是美国最自由的族群，但委员会却越来越贴近共和党议程和以色列福音派基督教支持者。	It is increasingly identified with the Republican agenda and Israel’s evangelical Christian supporters, even though polls have repeatedly shown that Jews are America’s most liberal ethnic group.
更糟的是，债务和信心危机也是欧盟自创立以来最严重的政治危机： 这次危机能否化解直接关系到欧盟本身的未来。	Worse still, Europe’s debt and confidence crisis is also the EU’s gravest political crisis since its inception: at stake is nothing less then the future of the European project itself.
我们在中国缓和朝鲜核危机以及草拟了安理会最近在达尔富尔问题的决议上看到了它们在这方面越来越好的表现。	We see this in the higher profile that China has taken in defusing the North Korean nuclear crisis and in drafting the recent Security Council resolution on Darfur.
如果企业在制裁所覆盖的领域经营，并且受影响产品的特殊性质决定了很难在其他地方出售，那么它有资格获得补偿。	A firm could be eligible for compensation if it operated in the sectors covered by sanctions, and if the product in question had special characteristics that prevented sales from being redirected elsewhere.
英国对宏大欧洲计划的抵制可以称得上可能迈向官僚主义的实体（尽管初衷良好）的民主抑制剂，应该被视为纠正技术官僚乌托邦主义的必要措施。	British resistance to grand European plans is the democratic grit in an enterprise that could become authoritarian, despite having the best intentions, and should serve as a necessary corrective to the utopianism of the technocrats.
老阿贝迪六年前返回利比亚，与被称为的黎波里旅（Tripoli Brigade）的新成立的西方支持的军阀并肩战斗。	The elder Abedi returned to Libya six years ago to fight alongside a new Western-backed Islamist militia known as the Tripoli Brigade.
情况的波动性太大，以至于我们无法知道法案到底包含什么 — — 以及哪些特殊利益集团会胜出 — — 直到它被通过之后才会真相大白。	The situation is so volatile that we may not know everything the bill contains – and which special interests won out – until after it is passed.
本次Heligendamm八国集团峰会可以促进两年前在格伦伊格尔斯做出的承诺，并且将世界带近到一个更为可持续发展的未来。	The meeting in Heiligendamm can advance the commitments made at Gleneagles two years ago and bring the world closer to a more sustainable future.
普京控制着一整套国家宣传机器，一套比任何一位俄国沙皇曾经拥有过的更无孔不入的镇压机制 — — 经历了几十年的极权主义，这套机制几乎已经刀枪不入。	Navalny has a YouTube channel; Putin controls the entire state apparatus, a mechanism of suppression vaster than any of the Russian czars ever had – and one that decades of totalitarianism have made virtually bulletproof.
然而奥克塔维奥·帕斯、巴勃罗·聂鲁达、加布里埃尔·加西亚·马尔克斯、卡洛斯·富恩特斯、迭戈·里维拉、古巴新吟游音乐运动及其后继者并没有随着拉美代表制民主的诞生而淡出人们的视线。	But Octavio Paz and Pablo Neruda, Gabriel García Márquez and Carlos Fuentes, Diego Rivera and the Nueva Trova Cubana and their successors did not fade into the background as representative democracy emerged in Latin America.
这些决定影响了26个核反应堆，然而61个核反应堆正在全世界范围内兴建，另外还有156个正在计划进行，还有343个反应堆政府正在考虑。	These decisions affect a total of 26 reactors, while 61 reactors are under construction around the world, with another 156 projected and 343 under official consideration.
首先，与之前所有的制度一样，美元本位制度是让国际收支逆差的国家承担调节收支平衡的责任，而不是让国际收支顺差的国家承担这个责任。	First, as with all systems that preceded it, it puts the burden of adjustment on deficit countries, not on surplus countries.
与十九世纪的安德鲁·杰克逊和威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩和二十世纪的休伊·朗和乔治·华莱士等领袖相关的传统被唐纳德·特朗普所利用。	Donald Trump tapped into a tradition associated with leaders like Andrew Jackson and William Jennings Bryan in the nineteenth century and Huey Long and George Wallace in the twentieth century.
英国退欧派也在吸引“普罗大众 ” ， UKIP领导人尼格尔·法拉奇（Nigel Farage）和“普通老百姓”一起在酒吧喝酒的形象就是明证。	Brexiteers, too, embraced the “great unwashed,” reflected in images of UKIP leader Nigel Farage drinking in pubs with “average blokes.”
普京最近的公开表态造成了这样一种印象：一个占统治地位的中右执政党，还有一个作为替代的（非马克思主义的）社会民主党时刻准备着在这个主要党派出现动摇时出面维持政府的稳定。	Putin’s recent public statements point to such a vision: a dominant center-right ruling party, with a (non-communist) social democratic alternative waiting in the wings to maintain stable government should the main party falter.
具体而言，它们承诺从2020年开始每年给予1,000亿美元的气候相关融资，而今年这一数字为250—300亿美元左右。	Specifically, they have promised $100 billion in climate-related financing per year, starting in 2020, up from around $25-30 billion this year.
这意味着，潜在的借款国没能充分吸收它们可以吸收的进口商品，并且没有按照应该的那样，依靠国际货币基金组织打算使用的为其成员国“提供信心”的多边资金储备积累。	The implication is that potential borrowers are not absorbing as many imports as they could and not relying, as they should, on the multilateral pooling of reserves that the Fund is meant to use to “give confidence” to its members.
发自北京 — — 整个2010年，中国都淹没在美国（及其他各国）国会关于“操纵”人民币以抢占出口优势并维持贸易顺差的指责之中。	BEIJING – Throughout 2010, China was criticized by the United States Congress (and many others) for “manipulating” its currency in order to maintain an advantage for exports, and thus preserve its trade surplus.
再后来，奥布斯菲尔德（Maurice Obstfeld）指出，除了财政转移，货币联盟还需要有明确定义的最后贷款人规则。	Later, Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that, in addition to fiscal transfers, a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort.
更重要的是，此次任命有欲盖弥彰的嫌疑：在日本众议院的480个议席中，只有39个（或7.9 % ） 为妇女。	More important, the appointments amounted to painting over the cracks: Only 39 of the 480 members of the Japanese Diet’s lower house, or 7.9%, are women.
当然，所有社会都应该关注最贫困的成员、实现社会流动最大化，同时奖励企业家精神、谴责只顾改善自己生活的人。	Of course, all societies should look out for their poorest members and maximize social mobility, while also rewarding entrepreneurship and challenging people to improve their lot.
在被问及莫斯科修建斯大林像的问题时，他搬出十七世纪英国内战议会派领袖克伦威尔，反问 ： “ 克伦威尔和斯大林的真正区别在哪里 ？ ”	Asked about Moscow’s plans for a statue of Stalin, he pointed to Oliver Cromwell, the leader of the Parliamentarian side in the seventeenth-century English Civil War, and asked: “What’s the real difference between Cromwell and Stalin?”
肯尼亚总统肯雅塔（Uhuru Kenyatta）几乎立刻阐明了态度 — — 上周的事件不会削弱肯尼亚维持其索马里政策的决心，即使他坦诚自己也在内罗毕大屠杀中失去了至亲。	President Uhuru Kenyatta made clear almost immediately that last week’s events will not weaken Kenya’s determination to maintain its policy on Somalia, even as he confirmed that he, too, lost loved ones in the Nairobi massacre.
此外，即便根据最乐观的估计，美国公众是否愿意在加强国内安全或许就能解决问题的情况下卷入另一次军事冒险也很值得怀疑。	Moreover, the American public’s willingness to become enmeshed in yet another risky military venture, when boosting homeland security could suffice, is dubious, at best.
中国认识到需要从专注于出口和投资驱动型生产（通过制造业）的模式转变为私人消费驱动型生产（通过服务 ） 。	It recognized the need to switch from a model that focused mainly on export- and investment-led production (via manufacturing) to one led by private consumption (via services).
如果在未来20年中继续爆炸式的增长，美国人是否会在某一天把它们的扩散视为未能采纳地区性平衡增长的巨大失败的例子呢？	If they continue their explosive growth over the next 20 years, will Americans someday come to regard their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure to adopt region-wide blueprints for balanced growth?
通过创造工作机会、加强沟通和数字连接以及为战后重建奠定基础，一个破碎地区的民众可以开始规划更加繁荣的未来。	By ensuring access to work, strengthening communication and digital access, and laying the groundwork for post-war reconstruction, the people of a shattered region can begin planning for a more prosperous future.
私人投资者可以提供风险资本、创新和管理方面的专长，既可以充当公共融资项目的承包人，也可以作为能产生收入的项目的合作方。	And private investors can provide risk capital, innovation, and management expertise, both as contractors on publicly funded projects and as partners in revenue-generating projects.
如今，委内瑞拉的经济已经演变成一场彻头彻尾的灾难，经济增长崩溃以及近乎恶性的通货膨胀使得该国处处民不聊生。	Today, Venezuela’s economy is a full-blown disaster, with the collapse in growth and near-hyperinflation causing widespread human suffering. In such circumstances, one might expect a traditional Latin American military coup.
他的操作从韩国开始，试图用同胞民族主义（ethnic nationalism）在韩国和它的美国盟友之间制造裂痕，甚至说服韩国放弃与美国结盟。	His campaign begins with South Korea, where he is attempting to use ethnic nationalism to drive a wedge between that country and its US ally and potentially even to convince it to abandon the alliance altogether.
一位评论家说他 ： “ 和摇滚明星一样帅，和公关一样有魅力 。 ” 前加拿大银行行长马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）履新英格兰银行行长第一周就带来了一场风暴。	With what one commentator described as “his rock star looks and PR charm,” Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada, has taken the city by storm in his first weeks as Governor of the Bank of England.
韩国生育率为每位妇女生育1.2胎 — — 为世界最低之一 — — 到2050年，其劳动力规模将缩小四分之一，65岁及以上人群将占总人口的35 % ， 而今天只有13 % 。	Given a fertility rate of just 1.2 births per woman – among the lowest in the world – South Korea’s labor force is set to shrink by a quarter by 2050, with people aged 65 and over accounting for 35% of the total population, up from 13% today.
那些对他们大受欢迎的党首杰里米·科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn）的左倾经济和外交政策立场表示怀疑的工党党员，仍然认为最明智的策略是保持耐心，在时机成熟时夺回他们的政党。	Those in Labour who are deeply suspicious of the left-wing economic and foreign-policy stance of their popular leader, Jeremy Corbyn, still think the most sensible strategy is to be patient and, when the opportunity arises, to recapture their party.
更强的竞争力：吸引外国公司的必要条件包括特别服务、工人的培训计划甚至是经营场地补贴。 而非洲的领导人在这方面的意识相对迟钝。	• Greater Competitiveness : African leaders have been slow to realize that they must woo foreign corporations with special services, training programs for workers, and even subsidized offices.
此外，猛然推翻巴沙尔可能给叙利亚国家带来致命打击，这一结果不符合任何人的利益（伊斯兰国和其他极端分子除外 ） 。	Furthermore, the abrupt removal of Assad could deal a fatal blow to the Syrian state – an outcome that is in no one’s interest (with the exception of ISIS and other extremists).
面临着波及全球范围的经济危机，世界各地的人们，不管是消费着还是投资者，都在削减开支，就象1930年代的大萧条那样。	People everywhere, consumers and investors alike, are canceling spending plans, because the world economy seems very risky right now. The same thing happened during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
如果非洲人试图改变这一点的话，他们就必须展开集体反思：在这场大规模贫困中，那些本土精英们究竟负有何种程度的合谋责任。	If Africans want to change this, they cannot spare themselves a collective debate about their elites’ complicity in widespread impoverishment.
欧洲对所有人公平竞争的信仰反映了它自身的利益，至少在某些方面如此，因为世界上的势力平衡正在发生变化。	Europe’s belief in fair play for all reflects its self-interest, at least in some ways, because the world’s balance of power is changing.
中方接受了这一证据，也同意盗窃工业技术与其他形式的间谍活动是不一样的并表示中国政府未来不会协助这类盗窃活动。	The Chinese accepted the evidence, agreed that stealing industrial technology was different from other forms of espionage, and said that the Chinese government would not assist in such theft in the future.
（特朗普从官方的@POTUS账户转发了他对这家企业的攻击言论，其顾问康韦其后在全国电视网插入了推销伊万卡产品的内容。	(Trump re-tweeted his attack on the company from the official @POTUS account, and his adviser Kellyanne Conway then plugged Ivanka’s line on national television.)
随着“中心一代”在一个纯正丹麦市民社会的基础上成长，并以丹麦人而不是外来人的视角来看待这个世界，获益的将不不止是他们自己，还有这个国家。	These young people and Denmark itself will benefit, as this “KVINFO generation” grows up with a genuine stake in Danish civil society, and seeing the world as Danes, not as guests.
欧洲仍处于一片混乱，伊朗危机仍无法靠外交手段解决，在这样的情况下，美国的新外交政策现实主义必然意味着美国不管有多不情愿，最终都将被迫重新祭出“再平衡战略 ” 。	With Europe in disarray, and Iran’s nuclear crisis still resistant to diplomatic resolution, America’s new foreign-policy realism could well imply that the US, however reluctantly, will ultimately be forced to revisit its “rebalancing strategy.”
它之所以让人诧异是因为法国不仅仅是欧盟共同体的创建国之一，也是为实现“前所未有的紧密联邦”而实施的所有重大步骤背后的主要推动力。	It is amazing because France is not just a founding member of the European Community, but also has been the main driving force behind all major steps toward “ever closer union.”
这一特朗普在国会山台阶上反复呼号的口号还让前3K党党魁大卫·杜克（David Duke）之流暴露出自己的真面目，叫嚣“我们做到了 ！ ”	And it is this slogan, which Trump repeated on the Capitol steps, that leads the likes of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke to unmask himself and crow, “We did it!”
伊斯坦布尔/吉隆坡—去年9月，世界领导人承诺在2030年终结饥饿，这是联合国可持续发展目标（SDG）的一部分。	ISTANBUL/KUALA LUMPUR – Last September, world leaders made a commitment to end hunger by 2030, as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
如果你认为社会、经济和政治挑战急需解决方案 — — 就像我一样 — — 那么民族情绪就有必要复兴以确保服务于“社会国家”的社会凝聚力。	For anyone who considers social, economic, and political challenges to be in urgent need of remedy – as I do – it makes sense that national sentiment would be revived to secure social cohesion in the service of a “social state.”
要让贪婪有所收敛，只能利用人们对损失的畏惧，要通过实例让人们得到教训 — — 没有人会为冒失的金融企业和代理人的错误埋单。	Greed has to be controlled by fear of loss, which derives from knowledge that the reckless institutions and agents will not be bailed out.
一些人坚持希腊必须完成偿付，不管这样会造成怎样的伤害和经济后果 — — 全然不顾此前诸任希腊政府都没有满足这一要求。	Some insist that Greece finish its payment program, regardless of the humanitarian and economic consequences – not to mention the failure of all previous Greek governments to meet its terms.
其间当然也不乏显著的进步：过去25年里，世界多养活了20亿人口 — — 尽管有57个国家未能实现目标 — — 但发展中国家整体饥饿率已经下降了近一半左右。	Of course, there has also been remarkable progress: over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra two billion people, and – for all the 57 failures – the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate.
在这些情形中，自由家长主义者对控制并向我们强加选择并没有感到不安 （ “ 系好安全带参加养老金计划，最终你会感谢我 ” ） 。	In these situations, liberal paternalists feel no qualms about taking control and forcing choices upon us (“Wear seat belts and enroll in the pension plan, and in the end you’ll thank me”).
日本首相近卫文磨试图接近美国包括与美国总统罗斯福举行直接会谈，但是都无功而返。 他深感受挫而在10月16日辞职，把首相位子让给了强硬派陆军大臣东条英机。	Feeling defeated by a series of failed approaches to the US, including an overture to hold direct talks with Roosevelt, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned on October 16, making hard-line Army Minister Hideki Tōjō his successor.
媒体对最新GFCI发布的主要关注点集中在排名榜最靠前的位置的变化：纽约取代伦敦名列榜首，香港和新加坡分列三四。	The press headlines accompanying the release of the latest GFCI focused on the change at the top of the league: New York leapfrogged ahead of London, while Hong Kong and Singapore held on in third and fourth place, respectively.
2008年金融危机后不久，美国司法部就同意了富国银行和美联银行的兼并和其他几宗兼并案，英国公平贸易办公室（UK Office of Fair Trade）反对苏格兰哈里法克斯银行（HBOS）和劳埃德集团（Lloyds）的立场也被压制。	The US Department of Justice agreed to the merger between Wells Fargo and Wachovia, among others, soon after the 2008 financial crisis, and the UK Office of Fair Trade was overruled in the merging of HBOS and Lloyds.
以色列和塞浦路斯正计划联合开发：以色列和希腊正讨论建管道，土耳其和黎巴嫩正在勘探；埃及正计划申请批准勘探。	Israel and Cyprus are planning joint exploration; Israel and Greece are discussing a pipeline; Turkey and Lebanon are prospecting; and Egypt is planning to license exploration.
美俄之间的脆弱和解可能无法坚持，特别是如果美国打破近来有益的沉默，再次提出谈判桌上没有阿萨德的位置。	The fragile rapprochement between the US and Russia may not hold, particularly if the US again insists – breaking its recent helpful silence – that Assad has no place at the negotiating table.
在这场经济挑战的完美风暴中，对于中国国家主席习近平是否像所有人认为的那样，一切尽在掌握的问题，也越来越受到质疑。	Amid this perfect storm of economic challenges, there are also growing questions about whether Chinese President Xi Jinping has as strong a grip on events as he would like everyone to think.
正如耶鲁历史学家保罗·肯尼迪一直以来所强调的那样，当一个国家的军事力量投射脱离了其不稳固的经济基础时，就会出现“帝国过度扩张”的状况。	As Yale historian Paul Kennedy has long stressed, a condition of “imperial overreach” arises when the projection of military power outstrips a country’s shaky economic foundations.
总的国防开支仅相当于目前国内生产总值的3.2 ％ ， 并预计在未来十年内下降至2.6％并在之后20年内保持在相同水平。	Total defense spending is now just 3.2% of GDP and is expected to decline to 2.6% over the next ten years and to remain at that level for the next 20 years.
而“国会和特朗普政府还应该审慎地使用财政政策来保持增长和就业 ” — —即使“联邦预算赤字的恶化 … … 将不幸地进一步制约”这一方向的措施。	And, “Congress and the Trump administration should also use fiscal policy prudently to maintain strong growth and employment” – even though “the worsening federal budget deficit … will unfortunately further handcuff” efforts in this direction.
《蜗居》这部片其实是改编自一部小说，书中描述了当今不择手段追求财富的中国，城市 — — 尤其是上海 — — 房价飞涨以及房地产狂热对中国年轻一代的影响。	“Wo Ju” is an adaptation of a novel about recent skyrocketing housing prices in Chinese cities – especially in Shanghai – and the effect of real-estate fever on young Chinese men and women in today’s get-rich-by-any-means China.
联合国气候变化专家小组就是这样告诉我们的。 最佳的模式表明，本世纪内海平面上升18到19厘米（7到24英寸 ） ， 一般估计为30厘米（一英尺 ） 。	This is what the United Nations climate panel is telling us; the best models indicate a sea-level rise over this century of 18 to 59 centimeters (7-24 inches), with the typical estimate at 30 centimeters (one foot).
这个方向的一个例子是我的卡尔加里大学研究团队和MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates工程师联合研发的神经之手（neuroArm ） 。	One example of this convergence is neuroArm, developed by my research team at the University of Calgary in conjunction with engineers at MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates.
此外，比尔梅斯和我在《三万亿美元战争 》 （ The Three Trillion Dollar War）一书中指出，布什战争进一步恶化了美国宏观经济，从而增加了赤字和债务负担。	Moreover, as Bilmes and I argued in our book The Three Trillion Dollar War, the wars contributed to America’s macroeconomic weaknesses, which exacerbated its deficits and debt burden.
卡塔尔领导人情愿挑战邻国，原因很简单：他们相信他们所支持的草根伊斯兰运动能赢得最终胜利。 在他们眼里，这一运动代表了大部分人的政治愿望。	Qatar’s leaders are willing to challenge their neighbors for a simple reason: They believe that the grassroots Islamist movements they support – which, in their view, represent majority political aspirations – eventually will win.
主要的问题看起来是缺乏创业精神以及投资工厂和设备的倾向低下，特别是提高可以在国际市场中进行交易的产品产量。 凯恩斯称之为“低下的动物精神 ” 。	The main problem seems to be the paucity of entrepreneurship and low propensity to invest in plant and equipment – what Keynes called “low animal spirits” – especially to raise output of products that can be traded on world markets.
这种关联在世界所有主要的地区都存在，在经过对其他危险因素的调整后估计会使患哮喘的危险性增加46 % 。	The association was present in all major regions of the world, with an estimated 46% increased risk following adjustment for other risk factors.
香港爆发了大规模示威活动反对大屠杀，每年6月香港都要举行大规模纪念仪式，保持在中国其余部分受到压制、正在逝去的鲜活记忆。	Huge demonstrations took place in Hong Kong to protest the massacre, and massive commemorations of the event are held every June, keeping alive a memory that is repressed and fading in the rest of China.
它们会用金钱或其他类型的贿赂来奖赏那些与官方保持统一口径的记者，而那些拒绝被收买的人可能会被剥夺某些基本权利（例如护照续签）或者遭到抹黑。	They might reward journalists for toeing the official line, using financial or other kinds of bribes. Those who refuse to be bought, however, may suffer the loss of basic rights (such as passport renewal), or have their reputations destroyed.
意大利太大，因此不能倒；同样，因为它太大，因此救不起。 如今，意大利正处于走向不归路的边缘，欧元区终结的大幕正在拉开。	With Italy too big to fail, too big to save, and now at the point of no return, the endgame for the eurozone has begun.
这一信息促使危地马拉政府重新评估了该国的森林法，出资采取新策略控制木柴使用、阻止非法采伐以及鼓励家庭使用替代能源资源。	This information has spurred the Guatemalan government to review the country’s forestry law, and to fund new strategies to control firewood use, prevent unauthorized logging, and encourage families to use alternative energy sources.
新的数据库将对被各国采用以促进了解教育体系各方面的政策予以编目，包括教师政策、学生评定和学校融资机制。	Its new databases will catalogue which policies countries have adopted to promote learning in each part of the education system, in areas ranging from teacher policies to student assessment to school financing mechanisms.
有机生产的另一个局限性在于它与强化土地质量的最佳办法背道而驰。 要强化土地质量，最好尽可能减少对土壤的扰动（如犁和耕 ） ， 并使用遮盖作物。	Another limitation of organic production is that it works against the best approach to enhancing soil quality – namely, the minimization of soil disturbance (such as that caused by plowing or tilling), combined with the use of cover crops.
美元仍是世界储备货币，2008年，危机一冒头，投资者们便纷纷涌向美国国债，这表明美国仍然拥有安全港的地位（尽管美国正是危机的始作俑者 ） 。	The dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, and investors’ scramble into US government debt at every peak in the crisis since 2008 has underscored America’s safe-haven status (even in crises that America caused).
无论是他的继任者戈登·布朗，还是乔治·布什的继任者，都不会也没有能力再发动一场类似于科索沃，更不用说伊拉克式的干预了。	Neither his successor, Gordon Brown, nor George W. Bush’s successor, whoever he or she turns out to be, will be able to mount another intervention similar to that in Kosovo, let alone Iraq.
在俄罗斯，这是普京经济学，匈牙利是奥班经济学，土耳其是厄尔多安经济学，还有意大利迄今还未爬出大坑的为期十年的贝卢斯科尼经济学。	Call it Putinomics in Russia, Órbanomics in Hungary, Erdoğanomics in Turkey, or a decade of Berlusconomics from which Italy is still recovering.
最重要的是，接下来的巴勒斯坦领袖必须做出艰难的决策，并尽快取得实质性的成果，才能使自己的领导地位更加稳固。	Most importantly, in order to consolidate his leadership, the next Palestinian leader must make some hard decisions and show some tangible results quickly.
事实上，各地区联储银行的领导人被称为“总裁 ” （ governor ） — —这一头衔与历史悠久的欧洲中央银行领导人相同 — — 来体现他们的权威。	The fact that the heads of each of the regional Fed banks were called “governor” – the same title given to heads of the long-established European central banks – was indicative of their authority.
奥斯陆进程开始后，他拒绝接受巴权力机构内部的任何官方职务，而是选择继续与当地的法塔赫干部保持密切联系。	When the Oslo process began, he refused to accept any official position within the Palestinian Authority, choosing instead to remain close to the local Fatah cadres.
大部分人会同意，通过入不敷出的社会保障和保险和对资源的滥用实现在总量上超过应有水平的生活水平会给子孙后代造成负担。	Most people might agree that living beyond our means in the aggregate, via unfunded social services and insurance, or disproportionate use of resources, imposes a burden on our offspring.
波兰的生育率 — — 1989年后就已下降至欧洲最低水平 — — 自2016年来已经从每名妇女1.29上升至1.42。	Poland’s fertility rate – which had fallen after 1989 to among the lowest in Europe – has risen since 2016 from 1.29 to 1.42 births per female.
1962年10月27日，就在苏联军队刚刚在古巴击落一架美国侦察机（导致飞行员丧生）后不久，一架类似的飞机在阿拉斯加附近常规搜集空气样本时无意间侵犯了苏联的西伯利亚领空。	On October 27, 1962, just after Soviet forces in Cuba shot down a US surveillance plane (killing the pilot), a similar plane taking routine air samples near Alaska inadvertently violated Soviet air space in Siberia.
欧盟领导人们在全面检视该组织的决策机制的《改革公约》上达成的年中协议令人可以舒一口气，但这一新协定能否得到27个成员国的批准仍然是个未知数。	Sighs of relief greeted EU leaders’ mid-year agreement on a Reform Treaty aimed at overhauling the Union’s decision-making mechanisms, but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in 27 countries.
保护和恢复泥炭地可以大幅减少全球二氧化碳排放，因此，2015年北欧部长理事会（Nordic Council of Ministers）做出承诺保护该地区泥炭地。	Conserving and restoring peatlands could significantly reduce global CO2 emissions, which is why, in 2015, the Nordic Council of Ministers announced a commitment to preserve the region’s peatlands.
他们认为尽管叙利亚政权令人厌恶，但如今却要在穆斯林世界实现民主的假想前景与危及基督徒生命的真实风险之间作出选择。	While the Syrian regime is odious, they argue, the choice is between a hypothetical hope of democracy in the Muslim world and the real risk of endangering Christians’ lives.
华尔街的朋友们却提出了相反的论调：如果任何金融机构很认真地，甚至举债来赌未来5年内美元与人民币之比会大幅度下降，那么，一旦交易出了问题，该机构就会面临生存危机。	Wall Streeters, however, offer a counterargument: for any financial institution to, say, bet on the decline of the dollar against the yuan over the next five years in a serious, leveraged way is to put its survival at risk should the trades go wrong.
尽管预算赤字不断膨胀，但美元在短期仍能保持强势，因为减税刺激了美国消费，提高了利率，反过来促使资本从海外流入。	Despite soaring budget deficits, the dollar remains strong in the short term, as the tax cuts have fueled US consumption and rising interest rates, which in turn pull in capital from abroad.
如果引入强有力的政策，由此释放的技术创新和学习曲线效应可能会像再生能源一样证明初始成本估算是悲观的。	If strong policies were introduced, the technological innovations and learning-curve effects unleashed would probably, as with renewable energy, prove the initial cost estimates to be pessimistic.
我们必须修复并强化监管框架，与此同时也要牢记，简单地要求银行业竞争压力最大化已不再可行，也不再可取，试图完全消除不稳定性亦然。	Let us fix and strengthen that framework, while bearing in mind that a simple mandate to maximize competitive pressure in banking is no more possible, or desirable, than one that would aim at eliminating instability completely.
新德里－在世界等待着北京奥运会开始的时候，许多人也想知道中国的盛大露面舞会是否也是其扭转美国在奖牌数上优势的场所。	NEW DELHI – As the world awaits the Beijing Olympics, many wonder whether China’s grand coming-out party will also mark the occasion when it wrests dominance of the medal tally from the United States.
也许对思考宇宙和生命的兴趣的增加要归因于这样一个事实：至少有十亿地球人，它们的衣食住行和安全问题已经基本得到了解决。	Perhaps the growing interest in reflecting on the universe and our lives is the result of the fact that, for at least a billion people on our planet, the problems of food, shelter, and personal security have largely been solved.
他们有能力组建一个政府性的机构去管理加沙地带吗？ 抑或该地区会陷入巴勒斯坦血腥的派系斗争之中并成为发动会招致以色列报复性打击的恐怖袭击的基地呢？	Will it be able to put together an effective governmental authority to rule the Gaza Strip, or will that area dissolve into bloody battles among Palestinian factions and a staging area for attacks into Israel that will bring reprisal raids?
大规模的重新评估最终正在进行。 美国的精英们现在承认市场资本主义处于危机之中，而其他国家不要盲目追随美国。	A massive reassessment is finally in progress, with US elites now recognizing that market capitalism is in crisis, and that the world will not blindly follow their lead.
让双方和解的努力开始于加沙，随后转移到开罗和大马士革，最后到麦迦在沙特国王阿卜杜拉的监督下进行。 沙特几十年来一直为巴勒斯坦提供资金支持。	Attempts to reconcile the parties began in Gaza, before moving to Cairo, Damascus, and finally Mecca under the supervision of Saudi King Abdullah, whose country has been a financial backer of the Palestinians for decades.
莫·易卜拉欣奖在2007年才成立，意味着候选人们的任期主要都是在奖项设立之前，因此也无法为了奖金改变其行为。	The Ibrahim Prize was established only in 2007, which means that the candidates have served most of their terms in office at a time when the prize could not have influenced their behavior.
出于同样的原因，法国总统奥朗德将内部安全摆在第一位（也许这和他的选民的偏好一致 ） ， 对财政规则的支持前后不一。	For the same reasons, French President François Hollande puts internal security first (possibly in line with the preferences of his electorate), and honors fiscal rules inconsistently.
纽黑文—非洲锥虫病（human African trypanosomiasis，HAT，又名昏睡病）长期以来让非洲撒哈拉以南农村人口饱受折磨。	NEW HAVEN – Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) – also known as sleeping sickness – has long plagued rural sub-Saharan African populations. A parasitic infection, it is often fatal when left untreated.
事实上，发动恐怖袭击的不仅包括伊斯兰国，还包括库尔德武装，后者要求自治挑战了土耳其民族不可分割的理念，而这也是凯末尔政府的一项基本原则。	Indeed, terrorist attacks have been launched not only by the Islamic State, but also by Kurdish militants, whose demands for autonomy challenge the concept of an indivisible Turkish nation – a cornerstone of the Kemalist state.
动用军队控制冲突影响地区不是让脊髓灰质炎工作人员进入那里的唯一办法，在一些地区，这也不是最有效的办法。	Using troops to assert control over conflict-affected areas is not the only way to improve access for polio workers, and in some cases it may not be the most effective.
而大会则向外界显示出，虽然法塔赫在其创建者和长期领导者亚希尔·阿拉法特去世后遭受了重创，但如今该组织已经成功地再次团结起来，并正在努力复兴。	The conference, it appears, succeeded in reuniting and reinvigorating the movement, which has suffered since the death of its founder and long-time leader, Yasser Arafat.
尽管如此，美俄关系永远是一分为二的，有许多迫在眉睫的多边问题美国必须与俄罗斯合作，特别是叙利亚、伊朗和阿富汗（美国将在今年撤军）问题。	Nonetheless, the US-Russia relationship has always been compartmentalized, and there are pressing multilateral issues on which the US must work with Russia, particularly Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan (where the US will withdraw its troops this year).
中国官员已经准备好收紧货币政策并实施管制手段以限制债务增加，而这必然意味着牺牲短期经济增长以将其扭回到一个更稳定的路径之上。	Chinese officials are poised to tighten monetary policy and impose regulatory measures to curb debt momentum, which is bound to mean sacrificing short-term economic growth in order to put growth back on a stable footing.
20世纪90年代初以来，雅加达政府为了改善交通流，采取了一项措施，高峰时段的私家车必须搭载三位或更多乘客才能进入雅加达市中央商务区。	Since the early 1990s, Jakarta’s government has sought to improve traffic flows with a rule that private cars driven during rush hours in the city’s central business district must contain three or more passengers.
美联储前主席沃尔克（Paul Volcker）绝非投资银行的游说者，但他一段时间以来一直持有相同的论点。	Former Fed Chair Paul Volcker, hardly a lobbyist for investment banks, has been making the same argument for some time.
特别是，这些地区应该培训和部署新的社区卫生工作者骨干队伍，识别疾病症状、提供疫情监控，并实施诊断和合理治疗。	In particular, these regions should train and deploy a new cadre of community health workers, trained to recognize disease symptoms, provide surveillance, and administer diagnoses and appropriate treatments.
法国的国民阵线（National Front ） — —现在改名叫国民联盟（National Rally ） — —则是一个努力跟其反犹太主义维希派根源撇清关系的勒庞家族企业。	France’s National Front, now called the National Rally, is a Le Pen family enterprise trying hard to dissociate itself from its anti-Semitic, Vichyite roots.
事实上，有包容性利润共享和雇员持股计划的公司，其员工所获得的工资常常显著高于没有这类安排的可比公司。	Indeed, workers in companies with inclusive profit-sharing and employee-ownership programs typically receive significantly higher wages than workers in comparable companies without such arrangements.
但和官方纸币不同，它们也没有相应的负债，这意味着不存在类似于央行的机构来维持其币值的义务及相应利益。	But, unlike official money, they also have no corresponding liability, meaning that there is no institution like a central bank with a vested interest in sustaining their value.
在《新约圣经》里，耶稣对是否要服从世俗权威这个问题有一个著名的回答，他拿出一枚罗马帝国的货币端详一番，对法利赛人说 ， “ 让凯撒的归凯撒 ” 。	In the New Testament, Christ famously answers a question about obedience to civil authorities by examining a coin and telling the Pharisees, “Render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s.”
新的风险偏好似乎正在席卷整个欧洲；Atomico的报告指出，85%以上的创始人认为开办自己的公司“在文化上可以接受 ” 。	A new appetite for risk seems to be sweeping the continent; Atomico reports that more than 85% of founders say it is “culturally acceptable” to start one’s own company.
外交政策问题没有几个月以前那么突出的另一个原因是随着国家情报评估机构最近有关伊朗核计划报告的出台，美国和伊朗爆发战争的可能性已经减少了。	Foreign policy has also become less salient than it was only months ago as the chance of war between the US and Iran has diminished, following the recently published National Intelligence Estimate on Iran’s nuclear program.
1999年一整年 ， 《 Oragir》遭遇的法律诉讼比亚美尼亚自1991年独立后所有诉讼媒体案例总数都要多。	Throughout 1999 there were more court cases against Oragir than against all other Armenian media combined since independence in 1991.
尽管爱沙尼亚的在线投票率在2007至2011年的选举中增加了近20 % ， 但总投票率只增加了两个百分点不到（从61.9%增加到63.5 % ） 。	Although the rate of online voting in Estonia increased by nearly 20% between the 2007 and 2011 elections there, overall voter turnout increased by fewer than two percentage points (from 61.9% to 63.5%).
但特朗普是位电视真人秀老手，他知道垄断观众的注意力才是成功的关键，而且要靠极端言论才能做到这一点，而不是谨慎地看待真相。	But Trump is a veteran of reality television, where he learned that the key to success is to monopolize viewers’ attention, and that the way to do that is with extreme statements, not careful regard for the truth.
本周，由联合国秘书长潘基文主持的气候峰会旨在让团结政府、商业和公民社会领袖齐聚一堂，为气候行动增加动力。	This week’s climate summit, hosted by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, was aimed at increasing the momentum for action by gathering government, business, and civil-society leaders.
来自东欧的新移民可能是对“和平群众”的制约。 对于他们来说，削减社会服务并不违反诺言，而且有工作和工资水平更为重要。	A counterweight to the “peace crowd” may be new migrants from Eastern Europe, for whom cuts in social services would break no promises, and for whom job availability and wage levels are more important.
富裕国家小家庭人均浪费更多，因为很难做到物尽其用，而富裕家庭“仅为安全起见”额外采购导致了浪费的增加。	Smaller households in rich countries waste more per person, because it is harder to put everything to use, while richer households add waste when they can afford to buy extra “just to be on the safe side.”
因此，值得一问投资者是否低估了这些冲突中的一个或多个引发严重危机的可能，以及如果真的发生严重危机的话，他们会遭到怎样的冲击。	So it is worth asking if investors are underestimating the potential for one or more of these conflicts to trigger a more serious crisis, and what it would take to shock them out of their complacency if they are.
纽约—一个完整的欧元危机解决方案必须包含三大主要部分：银行体系改革和资本结构调整、欧元债券机制，以及退出机制。	NEW YORK – A comprehensive solution of the euro crisis must have three major components: reform and recapitalization of the banking system, a eurobond regime, and an exit mechanism.
此外，当地的研究型大学，社区学院以及其他教育和社会机构一直都在出手协助社区将自身的公民更新愿景转化为行动。	Moreover, local research universities, community colleges, and other educational and social institutions have been stepping up to help communities translate their visions of civic renewal into action.
持有大量黑钱的人似乎已经找到了洗白的方法，而不是如政府所预期那样销毁这些钱以避免吸引税务人员的注意。	Those who held large quantities of black money seem to have found creative ways to launder it, rather than destroying it to avoid attracting the taxman’s attention, as the government expected.
而加利福尼亚的最核心问题则是其混乱的累进税收系统，其在个人所得，消费，企业所得以及燃油方面的征税额度都排在全美前列，只有不动产方面的税率低于全美平均水平。	At the heart of California’s problem is its deranged progressive tax system, which includes among the highest personal-income, sales, corporate, and gas rates of any state. Only property taxes are below the US average.
中东地区的动向令人担忧：弱国无力治理领土；极少数相对较强的国家为主宰权而互相争夺；军事和恐怖组织影响力日盛；而国家边界日益模糊。	The region’s trajectory is worrisome: weak states unable to police their territory; the few relatively strong states competing for primacy; militias and terrorist groups gaining greater influence; and the erasure of borders.
事实上，即使生物制药作物污染粮食作物，消费者通过玉米片、意大利面或豆腐摄入有害量处方药的可能性也非常低。	In fact, even if biopharmed plants were to contaminate food crops, the likelihood that consumers would end up with harmful amounts of prescription drugs in their corn flakes, pasta, or tofu is very small.
20世纪20~30年代和70年代充斥着中央银行家不了解这些基本原理的例子，而这些人所在的国家也因此在经济上付出了代价。	The 1920’s, 1930’s, and 1970’s are replete with examples of central bankers who did not understand the basics, and whose economies paid the price.
随着雨季的来临，可能爆发多种传染病，导致医疗体系无力应对，因此，动员、训练和提高公民应对能力就成为更加紧迫的任务。	As the rainy season approaches, threatening to facilitate the emergence of multiple epidemics that will overwhelm the health-care system’s capabilities, the need to mobilize, train, and equip citizens to respond has become even more urgent.
随着劳动力和资本从低生产率部门和地区转移到高生产率活动去，资源配置也变得更有效率，真实工资有所增长，经济结构也获得了升级。	As labor and capital moved from low-productivity sectors and regions to high-productivity activities, resource allocation became more efficient, real wages rose, and the economic structure was upgraded.
接着，希腊又做出了毫无意义的挑衅，拒绝与三驾马车谈判，尽管事实上这三家机构远比德国政府更加同情希腊的要求。	Then came the pointless provocation of refusing talks with the troika, despite the fact that the three institutions are all much more sympathetic to Greek demands than the German government.
第一次是1971年，美国结束了美元与黄金的可兑换性，开启了基于汇率自由浮动的法定纸币的新货币制度的大门。	First, in 1971, the US terminated the dollar’s convertibility to gold, opening the way for the emergence of a new exchange-rate regime, based on freely floating fiat currencies.
第二次重启发生在克林顿执政期间，其目标更大：建设全面的合作伙伴关系，促进美国大面积参与俄罗斯经济和变化中的政治制度。	The second reset, under President Bill Clinton, was more ambitious: a full-fledged effort to create a partnership that promoted substantial US involvement in Russia’s economy and evolving political system.
巴黎 — — 1983年，美国经济学家兼诺贝尔经济学奖得主瓦西里·列昂惕夫做出了在当时称得上是令人震惊的预测。	PARIS – In 1983, the American economist and Nobel laureate Wassily Leontief made what was then a startling prediction.
上次出现利率过低、持续时间过长（2001－2004年 ） ， 且其后正常化太过缓慢的情况直接导致了信贷、住房和股市的严重泡沫。	Last time, interest rates were too low for too long (2001-2004), and the subsequent rate normalization was too slow, inflating huge bubbles in credit, housing, and equity markets.
国际货币基金组织的一份报告显示，对已有资金及国内投资记录的发达国家而言 ， “ 统一税率并没有那么大吸引力 ” 。	For developed countries that already have capital and a track record of inward investment, “the appeal of the flat tax is consequently less,” as a report by the International Monetary Fund concludes.
但代际（generation）生命表 — — 用于回溯确定给定的年龄群体能活多久 — — 常常给出远高于阶段性生命表的平均寿命预期。	But generation life tables, which are used to determine retrospectively how old a given age group has become, usually show a much higher average life expectancy than period life tables.
据贸易部统计，自2004年以来大米的产量增加了2.5倍达到180，000吨，而同时进口大米的消费仅在2004至2005年之间就下降了一半。	Rice output has risen by two and a half times since 2004, according to the Ministry of Trade, to 180,000 metric tons, while consumption of imported rice fell by half from 2004 to 2005 alone.
他将之称为他在名著《道德谱系学 》 （ On the Genealogy of Morality）中猛烈抨击的“奴隶道德”的一个例子。 奴隶道德是“低级”道德方法，只注重减少痛苦。	He called it an example of the “slave morality” that he lambasts in his great work On the Genealogy of Morality – a “lowly” approach to morality, focused simply on relieving suffering.
鉴于他过去曾批评过美国的前线基地，他可能会做出一种戏剧性的表态，表明美国无意利用韩国驻军来对抗朝鲜的力量。	Given that he has criticized America’s forward bases in the past, he may suggest a dramatic gesture to show that the US has no intention of using its troops in South Korea against the North.
即便电池性能大幅改良延长了无人机航程，但人们对大批人员空中运输车辆的迷恋会造成令人望而生畏的安全风险因素。	Even with dramatically improved batteries extending drones’ range, the crush of vehicles needed to move large numbers of people overhead would present a daunting safety hazard.
阿波罗计划为创新者明确制定了目标和实现步骤：先将动物送入轨道，之后是人，之后是向月球发射探测器，最后将人送上月球。	The Apollo program gave innovators clearly defined goals and a roadmap for getting there: first put animals in orbit, then put people there, then send probes to the moon, then send people there.
目前中国政府鼓励各方资源，计划投入1800亿美元在未来7年内建成本国的5G移动网络，同时支持量子技术的发展。	The authorities are now mobilizing resources to invest $180 billion in building China’s 5G mobile network over the next seven years, and are supporting the development of quantum technology.
但叙利亚内战似乎没有平静下来的趋势，而叙利亚作为统一国家事实上的内爆将继续挑战土耳其政治及社会凝聚力，造成试图涌入土耳其的难民越来越多。	Yet Syria’s civil war does not appear to be winding down, and the de facto implosion of Syria as a coherent state will continue to challenge Turkish politics and social cohesion, with more and more refugees trying to cross into Turkey.
这一政策背后的思想是劳动力需求是不变的，而雇主为满足最终需求所需要的这一固定数量的总劳动时间可以在工人之间更加平均地分配，以减少失业。	The idea behind the policy is that demand for labor is a constant, and that this fixed number of aggregate working hours required by employers to meet final demand can be spread more evenly among workers to reduce unemployment.
对于关注世界肾脏日来说，还有比全球的健康领袖们迈出勇敢的一步，敦促各国试行为捐赠者提供回报更好的方法吗？	What better way to mark World Kidney Day than for global health leaders to take a bold step and urge countries to experiment with donor rewards?
参议员保罗·松加斯（Paul Tsongas）于1992年竞选总统时的口号就是“冷战结束，日本赢了 。 ”	Senator Paul Tsongas campaigned for president in 1992 on the slogan, “The Cold War is over and Japan has won.”
这种精明是（比如）爱尔兰政治制度实现强力转变的关键。 这个深度保守的国家选举印度裔同性恋人士沃尔德卡为总理。	Such canniness was vital to bring about the powerful shift in Ireland’s political system, for example, with the deeply conservative country electing Leo Varadkar, a gay man of Indian origin, as its prime minister.
但它却仅占全球二氧化碳排放的2.3 % ， 部分原因是三分之二的非洲人口（6.21亿）还没有用上电。	Yet it accounts for only 2.3% of global CO2 emissions. That is partly because two-thirds of Africans – 621 million people – do not have access to electricity.
《里斯本条约》在联盟如何运作的问题上重新设计了一个基本框架，然而即便提升欧盟机构灵活性和适应性的需要已经迫在眉睫，条约却依然停留在等待批准的阶段。	The Lisbon Treaty offers a fundamental redesign of how the Union works, but, despite the pressing need to enhance EU institutions’ mobility and flexibility, it is still awaiting ratification.
另一位已故斯坦福大学教授，诺贝尔奖获得者肯尼思·阿罗（Kenneth Arrow，也是萨默斯的叔叔）的一篇经典论文中也研究得出了潜在的超量有利经济效应。	The potential outsize beneficial economic effects were developed in a classic paper by another late Stanford University colleague (and Summers’s uncle), Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow.
私有市场会接手的宣传进行了二十年，然而这些贫困地区距离改良种子、肥料、以及小规模的灌溉技术却越来越远。	And still, after twenty years of preaching that private markets would pick up the slack, these impoverished communities are further away than ever from using improved seeds, fertilizers, and small-scale water management technologies.
当前的金融危机突出了这一需要，也就是奥巴马应该在其任期内尽早处理该地区的新现实。 这一金融危机十分清除地表明全球经济实力已经移向东方。	The need for Obama to address the region’s new realities early in his tenure has been underlined by the current financial crisis, which has made abundantly clear that the center of global economic power has shifted toward the East.
当收入与生产率水平相去甚远时（目前就是如此 ） ， 提振增长就需要改变贸易条件，改变贸易条件可以通过汇率（不管是汇率管制还是由市场决定）实现。	When incomes get significantly out of line with productivity levels (as they have recently), reviving growth requires resetting the terms of trade, which can be done with exchange rates, whether managed or set by markets.
大阿亚图拉侯赛因·阿里·蒙塔泽里曾是伊朗最高级的神职人员，假使他没有在霍梅尼死前数月和最高领袖兼伊斯兰共和国创始人大阿亚图拉霍梅尼闹翻他自己就会继任成为伊朗的最高领袖。	Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, one of Iran’s most senior clerics, would have been Supreme Leader himself had he not fallen out with Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic’s founder, a few months before Khomeini’s death.
但世贸组织规则在发生冲突时占据上风，因为世贸规则赋予所有世贸成员国可以执行的权利，而只有少数国家能享受到优惠贸易协定中规定的权利。	But, when there was a conflict, WTO rules prevailed, because they conferred enforceable rights that extended to all WTO members, whereas PTA-defined rights extended only to the PTA’s few members.
柏林 — — 在当今全球金融危机的背景下，黑天鹅的形象已经成为表面看似不可能的事情但不知何故而发生，最终导致世界起伏跌宕的象征。	BERLIN – In today’s global financial crisis, the image of a black swan has become a symbol for the seemingly impossible that somehow occurs, turning the world upside down.
在这方面，基础设施计划应该让州和地方在选择为那些项目提供资金方面扮演关键角色，这些政府单元也应该承担部分成本，将自己的利益牵涉其中。	To that end, an infrastructure program should give states and localities a key role in selecting the projects to be funded, and these governmental units should have “skin in the game” by funding part of the costs.
总而言之， 2009 年拉美的综合局势错综复杂，既有经济、政治和国际领域的进步，但同时也伴随着后退趋势和令人担忧的潮流。	In sum, 2009 ended with a mixed panorama in Latin America, with economic, political, and international progress accompanied by regressive and worrying trends.
不仅如此，确保欧盟实现战略自主性需要有竞争力的欧洲国防工业，并需要各国共同确保大幅追加国防科技研发投资。	Moreover, in order for the EU to achieve strategic autonomy, it needs a competitive European defense industry, with investment in research and development of defense technologies rising substantially as part of a common effort.
许多欧洲人会认为，这进一步表明（如果有任何需要的话）美国将永远 — — 也是灾难性地 — — 保护以色列免于面对其行为的国际和名誉后果。	Many Europeans will conclude that this is further evidence (if any was needed) that the US will always – and disastrously – protect Israel from the international and reputational consequences of its actions.
在此之前，2000年第三季度至2002年第一季度，纽约标准普尔500指数实际收益下跌了55 % ， 是自1957年该指数创建以来最大的跌幅。	Before that, between the third quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2002, real S&P 500 earnings fell 55% – the biggest-ever decline since the index was created in 1957.
暴跌总是会引起人们的关注，而这促使一些人对未来的下跌变得尤为警惕，并且准备在下一次暴跌来临时卖掉手里的股票。	Big drops get their attention, and this primes some people to be attentive for them in the future, and to be ready to sell if another one comes.
但是，尽管乌克兰大拉比和犹太领袖强烈反对普京关于反犹太过度的主张，但在乌克兰现代史上充满了令人担忧的憎恨和流血。	Still, though Ukraine’s chief rabbis and Jewish leaders have emphatically rejected Putin’s claims of anti-Semitic excesses, there is enough hatred and blood in Ukraine’s recent history to make one worry.
最后，拉美能源经济和中国在区域内日益增长的重要地位催化了从2004年开始的井喷式增长，但高科技制造和服务出口所占的份额已经有所降低。	Finally, while Latin America’s resource-based economic model and the increasing importance of China in the region catalyzed the growth spurt that began in 2004, the share of high-technology manufacturing and services exports has decreased.
诺贝尔奖获得者、自由派改革者巴拉迪与法官俱乐部（Judges Club）头目、忠于穆巴拉克的辛德（Ahmed El-Zind��几无相同之处。	Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, a liberal reformer, has little in common with Ahmed El-Zind, the head of the Judges Club and a Mubarak loyalist.
不幸的是，由于意大利明年仍将处于衰退，其实际赤字预计将达到GDP的1.8 % ， 这笔赤字将加到国民债务头上。	Unfortunately, because Italy will still be in recession next year, its actual deficit is expected to be 1.8% of GDP, adding to the national debt.
在1973年能源价格跳涨以后，年度全球增长从1960年到1973年的大约5%下降到1973年到1989年的约3 % 。	After the upward jump in energy prices in 1973, annual global growth fell from roughly 5% between 1960 and 1973 to around 3% between 1973 and 1989.
从现在起三十年后，没有貌似心灵感应般的数字助理我们就不知道要怎样生活，就像今天每隔几分钟不看看口袋里那台的二十世纪八十年代的大型计算机就会令人觉得难以想象。	Thirty years from now, we will wonder how we ever got along without our seemingly telepathic digital assistants, just as today it’s already hard to imagine going more than a few minutes without checking the 1980s mainframe in one’s pocket.
好消息是，分开看，这些投资约束的每一个都可以 — — 也应该 — — 得到解决；最新的美国商业投资数据就表现出一些改善。	The good news is that each of these constraints on investment can – and should – be addressed; and recent US business investment data suggest some progress.
无知之幕改变了几乎每一个问题的讨论性质，从高管薪酬、工资差异、工作环境到长期战略、接班人计划等莫不如此。	The veil of ignorance changes the nature of the discussion on almost every issue, from executive pay, wage discrepancies, and working conditions to long-term strategy, succession planning, and much more.
波兰目前最大的困难是失业率居高不下，一直徘徊在20%左右，超过了其它所有的欧盟国家。 另一个问题就是贫富差距日益扩大。	The most difficult problems in Poland are unemployment, which hovers around 20% – the highest rate in the EU – and the growing divide between rich and poor.
在此承诺之下，世界银行加入到了一个包含联合国、国际货币基金组织和经合组织在内的不断扩大的国际组织群体之中，共同呼吁中止这类补贴。	With this pledge, the World Bank joined an expanding list of international bodies, including the UN, the IMF, and the OECD, that are calling for an end to such subsidies.
毕竟，全球化的的确确从根本上改变了经济现状，实现了低技能工作向发展中国家的转移 — — 民粹主义分子对这一点的强调永远都是不厌其烦的。	It is true, after all, that globalization has fundamentally transformed economies, sending low-skill jobs to the developing world – a point that populist figures never tire of highlighting.
这种冲击会通过减少对当地商品和服务的消费而成倍放大，意味着整个地方经济中的劳动者和雇主都会受到冲击。	The impact is multiplied through reduced spending on local goods and services, which means workers and employers across the entire local economy feel the hit.
从我的角度看，公私伙伴关系模式已经使利比里亚的教育发生了革命性的变化，而我坚定地认为这种模式在非洲其他地区也能取得效果。	From my perspective, the public-private partnership model has revolutionized education in Liberia, and I am confident that it can work in other parts of Africa, too.
克服这些障碍最重要的是各PTA之间需要有一定程度的一致性，在监管问题上，各种不同协议应该遵循大致相同的原则。	Overcoming these obstacles will require, first and foremost, some level of coherence among PTAs, with the various deals following roughly similar principles when addressing regulatory issues.
英国大学管辖权1992年后就从教育和科学部转移到了教育和就业部，之后又在2009年转移到了新设立的商业、创新和技能部就是生动的例子。	A telling example is the shift in jurisdiction over British universities since 1992 from the Department of Education and Science to the Department for Education and Employment, and, in 2009, to a new Department for Business, Innovation, and Skills.
意大利总理还可以强制要求议会二号人物重新考虑他们的决定（在英国，国王将这一权力外包给了上议院 ） 。	The Italian president can also compel parliamentary deputies to rethink their decisions (in the United Kingdom, the monarch has outsourced this authority to the House of Lords).
最终，瓦哈比派的宗教狂热成为现代逊尼派伊斯兰恐怖主义的温床，而沙特阿拉伯本身也被自己所创造出来的东西所威胁。	Ultimately, Wahhabi fanaticism became the basis of modern Sunni Islamist terror, and Saudi Arabia itself is now threatened by its own creation.
欧盟委员会前任主席珀斯在1991年面临南斯拉夫解体的时候曾经发表现在受到嘲笑的著名声明。 他说 ： “ 这是欧洲的时刻，而不是美国人的时刻 。 ”	Confronting the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991, former EU Council President Jacques Poos made his famous but now derided statement: “This is the hour of Europe… not the hour of the Americans.”
在此期间，我们建立了联合国、通过了世界人权宣言，并且无休止地探讨政府对民众的“保护责任 ” 。 但眼看叙利亚的悲剧不断发展，人们可能认为情况没有发生任何变化。	In that time, we have created the United Nations, adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and discussed endlessly governments’ “responsibility to protect” their citizens.
这些国家可以让美洲国家组织大会轻易地通过接纳古巴的决议，并给奥巴马留下更多时间去说服国会和民众，好让美国可以通过一部可以微妙平衡各方面利益的古巴法案。	They could have easily let the OAS assembly go by, giving the new American president more time to prepare his Congress and public opinion for a delicate balancing act.
经济学家艾米丽·奥斯特（Emily Oster）指出，中世纪烧死巫师风潮最盛的时候正是经济剥削和显而易见与气候相关的粮食短缺时期，这段时间有数十万巫师（大部分是女巫）被杀死。	Economist Emily Oster has argued that the biggest spikes in witch burnings in the Middle Ages, in which hundreds of thousands (mostly women) were killed, came during periods of economic deprivation and apparently weather-related food shortages.
华盛顿 — — 即使在美国及其盟国在伊拉克和叙利亚展开空中轰炸的同时，他们的目标伊斯兰国可能正在准备在另一条战线上展开报复行动。	WASHINGTON, DC – Even as the United States and its allies carry out aerial bombardments in Iraq and Syria, their target, the Islamic State (ISIS), may be preparing to retaliate on another front.
一位新当选的共和党国会议员格雷戈·甘安福特听从了特朗普的建议，在被问及对医疗保健问题的看法后袭击了一位卫报记者。	One newly elected Republican member of Congress, Greg Gianforte, took this literally and assaulted a Guardian reporter after being questioned about his views on health care.
发自拉古纳海滩 — — 金融市场似乎确信，最近商业和消费者对美国经济的信心回升将迅速反映在诸如GDP增长，商业投资，消费和工资等“硬”数据上。	LAGUNA BEACH – Financial markets seem convinced that the recent surge in business and consumer confidence in the US economy will soon be reflected in “hard” data, such as GDP growth, business investment, consumption, and wages.
“尼赫鲁共识”促进了印度民主的成熟，协调了印度的多样化利益，没有让任何一个群体或部分主宰这个方兴未艾的民族国家。	The “Nehruvian consensus” facilitated India’s democratic maturation and accommodated the country’s many diverse interests, without permitting any one group or section to dominate the nascent nation-state.
除一处相对次要的电子表格错误外，他们发现莱因哈特/罗格夫研究所采用的某些方法使人对结果的可靠性产生了怀疑。	Along with a relatively minor spreadsheet error, they identified some methodological choices in the original Reinhart/Rogoff work that threw the robustness of their results into question.
但对于现在，我看见实证证据、国际比较、时间序列研究和美国国内地方差异研究都一边倒地表明财政政策是有作用的。	But, for now, I find the empirical evidence, international comparisons, time-series studies, and studies of local variation within the United States compelling in suggesting that fiscal policy works.
经济学家毛里斯·奥布斯菲尔德（Maurice Obstfeld）和加里纳·赫尔（Galina Hale）最近指出，德国和法国银行在为亚洲储蓄者和欧洲外围国家充当中介的业务中赚取了大量利润。	As the economists Maurice Obstfeld and Galina Hale recently noted, German and French banks earned large profits intermediating flows between Asian savers and Europe’s periphery.
如果英国过渡性支付在五六年中一直保持在当前水平（10亿欧元）左右 — — 这是谈判永久性贸易关系的现实要求 — — 其总和也将达到这一规模。	If Britain’s transitional payments continued near the current level of €10 billion for the five or six years realistically required to negotiate a permanent trading relationship, they would add up to the same amount.
美国民主 — — 以及美国外交政策 — — 至少需要两大政党，不能只有一个主流政党而另一个极端边缘化。	American democracy – and US foreign policy – needs at least two major parties, not one in the mainstream and the other on the extreme fringe.
一个值得探索的短期选择方案是成立一个仍以阿拉维少数派代表为首的联合政府，这是让巴沙尔远离权力的必要的让步。	One near-term option worth exploring is a coalition government still headed by a representative of the Alawite minority, a concession that could well be the price of moving Assad out of power.
最重要的是，如今大部分新兴经济体的金融状况要比十年或二十年前可靠得多。 当时，金融脆弱性导致了货币、银行和主权债务危机。	Above all, most emerging markets are financially more sound today than they were a decade or two ago, when financial fragilities led to currency, banking, and sovereign-debt crises.
比如，始于2008年的全球金融和经济危机 — — 及税后监管者和决策者的应对 — — 影响了经济增长、就业创造和收入平等。	For example, the global financial and economic crises that began in 2008 – and the subsequent responses by regulators and policymakers – have impacted economic growth, job creation, and income equality.
相反，世界正在对难以言喻的暴行画面表现出纯粹的愤怒 — — 包括阿萨德政权的酷刑拷问或反对派执行的处决。	Instead, the world is responding to graphic images of unspeakable brutality – torture by the regime or executions carried out by the opposition – with sterile shows of outrage.
现在医疗保险约占美国所有支出的六分之一, 私人医疗保险和公共医疗保险都一样 , 并且将在2035年翻番。	There are many places where savings can be made. Encouraging people to exercise, to avoid smoking, to use alcohol only in moderation, and to eat less red meat would help to reduce health-care costs.
在这里，我得回顾一下20世纪30年代，想想历史事件是如何循环的 — — 先是一场悲剧，随后马克思主义横空出世，带来另一场悲剧。	And here I reflect on the 1930’s, and on how historical events recur, appearing first as tragedy and then, pace Karl Marx, as yet another tragedy.
直到最近，普遍的观点依旧认为一个“成熟”的主权国家必须能承担起自己的负债，只有那些经济单一，政局混乱的“香蕉共和国”才会欠债不还。	Until recently, the conventional view was that “mature” sovereigns always honored their debts, while only banana republics failed to do so.
尽管确实存在一些相似之处，但她认为世界各地不同流派的左翼民粹主义都“需要根据其不同背景来理解 ” 。	Despite some resemblances, she believes that the different varieties of left-wing populism around the world “need to be apprehended according to their various contexts.”
俄罗斯的手段可谓肆无忌惮，据说2015年乌克兰政府警告在Facebook和美国政府的官员，俄罗斯可能对美国也如法炮制。	The Russian effort has been so aggressive that, in 2015, the Ukrainian government reportedly warned officials at Facebook and within the US government that a similar strategy could be used against the US.
国际货币基金组织（IMF）的研究表明这些财政乘数 — — 被预测者忽略的第二大因素 — — 随基本经济条件的波动而变化。	Research by the International Monetary Fund has indicated that these fiscal multipliers – the second factor overlooked by forecasters – vary with underlying economic conditions.
与此同时，印度也已开始连接东印度曼尼普尔邦至缅甸北部的公路建设，印度边境公路组织（Border Roads Organization）正在完成这条连接两国的第一条全天候公路。	Meanwhile, India has already opened up road communications linking the East Indian state of Manipur to North Myanmar, with India’s Border Roads Organization completing the first all-weather road connecting the two countries.
此外，类似保罗•普雷维什（Raúl Prebisch）这样的左翼经济学家后来又进一步推广了初级商品的“贸易条件衰退”理论：这些产品的价格相对于制成品价格来说在长期趋势上是下跌的。	Left-wing economists like Raúl Prebisch, moreover, later advanced the theory of “declining terms of trade” for primary products: their prices’ long-run tendency to fall relative to the prices of manufactured goods.
罗斯福的密友、财政部长小亨利·摩根索（Henry Morgenthau Jr . ） 写道 ， “ 八年后 … … 我们的失业与开始是一样高 … … 此外还背上了巨额债务 。 ”	FDR’s close friend, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., worried that “after eight years…we [will] have just as much unemployment as when we started…and an enormous debt, to boot.”
教育是进步的基石，受过教育的女性会给非洲带来力量，因此目前的当务之急是督促未能缩小差异的国家改变现状。	Education is the bedrock for progress and educated women will empower Africa, so the focus now must be on those countries that are failing to close the gap.
但是，在伊拉克的混乱和废墟之下，一个粗糙而又跌跌撞撞的私营部门从美国入侵以来就一直在扩大，并且获益于高昂的石油收入以及更为自由化的经济政策。	Yet beneath Iraq’s chaos and the rubble, a rough and tumble private sector has been expanding since the US invasion, benefiting from higher oil revenues and more liberal economic policies.
在布什总统的第一个任期内，国务卿鲍威尔理解并提出柔性力量，而拉氏在2003年被问及柔性力量的时候回答说 ： “ 我根本就不知道它是什么东西 ” 。	During President George W. Bush’s first term, Secretary of State Colin Powell understood and referred to soft power, whereas Rumsfeld, when asked about soft power in 2003, replied “I don’t know what it means.”
得益于2008年雷曼兄弟破产后采取的扩张性财政政策，去年日本经济实现了相对健康的3%年增长率，高于美国和欧盟。	Last year, Japan’s economy grew at a relatively healthy 3% annual rate, higher than in the United States or the European Union, owing mainly to the fiscal expansion undertaken after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
为什么不让中国主席胡锦涛来代替普京的席位，因为（按世界价格计算 ） ， 中国经济已经牢牢占据了世界第二的位置。	Why wasn’t Chinese president Hu Jintao, whose country’s economy is the world’s second largest (when measured at world prices), given a seat at the table instead of Putin?
超过五分之一的15—24岁非洲人没有工作，只有三分之一完成了小学教育，而尽管取得了一些进展，但较高层次教育就学率仍然很低。	More than one in five Africans aged 15-24 is unemployed, only one-third have completed primary school, and, despite some progress, the rate of higher education remains low.
很难想象支持虐童、种族仇恨或虐待的艺术作品值得赞美（尽管和性内容比起来，对人们的刺激作用并不那么大 ） 。	It is hard to imagine admiring art that espouses child abuse, racial hatred, or torture (even though this seems to get people much less agitated than sexual content).
考虑到各种不确定性 — — 为何它会奏效、怎样做才最有效率，以及如何退出 — — 为何央行行长们 — — 对他们来说 ， “ 创新”通常是褒义词 — — 在采纳它时会一改保守主义作风？	Given all the uncertainty – why it works, how to make it most effective, and how to exit – why have central bankers, for whom “innovative” is usually an epithet, departed from their usual conservatism in adopting it?
作为出口导向型经济和拥有世界最大规模外汇储备的国家 — — 更不用提其保守的国内金融体系了 — — 中国已暴露在国际经济和金融的动荡之下。	With an export-oriented economy and the world’s largest pile of foreign reserves, not to mention a conservative domestic financial system, China is exposed to international economic and financial volatility.
莫迪显然是拥护经济增长的，并且他一贯认为他的成功基础正是在家乡古吉拉特邦担任首席部长时在建设公路、保证电力供应等方面的成就。	Modi has certainly championed economic growth, and he constantly points to his success in building roads and ensuring power supply as Chief Minister in his home state of Gujarat.
在即将召开的峰会中，领导人们应该重申EDA的重要性。 由于几个成员国的抵制，EDA预算一直处于冻结状态。	At the upcoming summit, leaders should reiterate the importance of the EDA, whose budget has remained frozen at the insistence of certain member states.
虽然俄罗斯的主权财富基金和国有公司不大可能在一夜之间发生改变，但是，在不远的将来，它们一定会变得更加透明而高效。	While it is unlikely that Russian sovereign wealth funds and state-owned companies will change overnight, they will certainly become more transparent and efficient in the near future.
但监管草案的内容与2012年高级别转接小组的建议相去甚远，专家小组的建议包括建立一道绝缘墙，隔绝银行的投机性交易业务和零售及商业银行业务。	But the draft regulation falls far short of the recommendations made by a high-level expert group in 2012, which included an impermeable wall between banks’ speculative-trading business and their retail and commercial banking activities.
我本人所在的州也将从更松散的联邦中获益，利用扩大了操作空间加紧监管、增加社会服务，资金可以来自节省下来的上缴给联邦政府的税金。	My own state would thrive in such a looser federation, using its increased margin of maneuver to tighten its own regulations and to scale up its social services with the savings in taxes now paid to the federal government.
2014年，格雷罗因为利用数据改善健康状况而获得鲁克斯奖（Roux Prize ） ， 这进一步提升了他的工作的知名度。	In 2014, Guerrero won the Roux Prize for his use of data to improve health, further elevating awareness of his work.
“为了成为真正意义上的发达现代化国家 ， ” 格雷厄姆继续写道 ， “ 俄罗斯在今后十年中需要投入至少1万亿美元，用于实现基础设施现代化。	“In order to become a genuinely developed and modern country,” Graham continues, “in the coming decade Russia will need to invest at least one trillion dollars in modernizing its infrastructure.
各个国家需要重新制定各自的能源政策 - - 包括提高生产和精炼能力，多样化能源，给节能注入新的动力。	Countries need to reformulate their energy policies - including by boosting production and refining capacity, diversifying energy sources, and giving new impetus to conservation.
在由学者和记者组成的Odlišnost （差别）杂志，我们为确定1990到2015年间移民对欧洲和中东本土工人的影响回顾了20项实证研究结果。	At Odlišnost (Distinction), a collective of academics and journalists, we have reviewed 20 empirical studies to determine the effect that immigrants had on native workers in Europe and the Middle East between 1990 and 2015.
这番话的重点是同性恋者本质上都是恋童癖；要在索契确保安全，他们只需要在俄罗斯期间控制住自己，回到各自的堕落国家后便可以老方一帖。	The assumption here is that homosexuals are pedophiles at heart; to be safe in Sochi, they need only to control themselves until they return home to their decadent countries.
但是，采取可能有预料地杀死无辜的行动是可以接受的信条将会产生导致我们理应善待而不不善待被杀身亡的人的结果。	Nevertheless, the doctrine that it is acceptable to take actions that will foreseeably kill innocent people can have the effect of leading us to treat more lightly than we should the deaths of those killed.
如果说衍生品和短期回购协议等金融创新让市场变得更加波动、更加脆弱的话，那么托宾税有助于稳定和强化市场。	And, if financial innovations like derivatives and short-term repurchase agreements have made markets more volatile and fragile, a Tobin tax could help to stabilize and strengthen them.
法国人十分难过地意识到，他们不仅仅在世界政治，在文化、科学，尤其是语言方面的地位和权威性正在日益下滑。	The French regard with great sadness their declining status and prestige – not only in world politics, but also in culture, science and, importantly, language.
而考虑到货币市场基金可能为全球金融系统带来的风险 — — 正如其在2008年所扮演的不稳定角色—自然也不难明白人们为何如此忧虑。	Given the risks that money market funds can pose to the global financial system, as shown by their destabilizing role in the 2008 financial crisis, it is not hard to see why they are worried.
言下之意，我们认为如果没有北美自由贸易协定，那么墨西哥今天的情况将会更糟，就协定本身而言，它给墨西哥带来的更多的还是积极有利的一面。	We thus implicitly suggest that Mexicans would be far wose off today without NAFTA and its effects weighing in on the positive side of the scale.
但欧洲的长期掠夺性殖民主义史让人们很难猜测，如果欧洲人带来的只是贸易而没有征服，亚洲和非洲的制度和机构会发展成怎样。	But Europe’s long history of exploitative colonialism makes it hard to guess how Asian and African institutions would have evolved in a parallel universe where Europeans came only to trade, not to conquer.
2009年，反腐律师谢尔盖·马格尼茨基（Sergei Magnitsky）因为被禁止接受致命状况的治疗而死在狱中。	In 2009, Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer campaigning against corruption, died in prison after being denied medical care for life-threatening conditions.
据说，银行建立起来的市场实际上是它们的内测市场，主要功能是方便银行及其客户对某些金融工具进行定价 — — 没有市场交易，这种定价通常是不可能的。	The banks themselves established what in effect were their own substitute markets, which allowed their customers and themselves to price instruments that would otherwise have been impossible to value.
奥巴马在2014年国情咨文中指出 ： “ 在充满复杂威胁的世界中，我们的安全取决于我们的实力的所有要素 — — 包括强势的有原则的外交 。 ”	As Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address, “in a world of complex threats, our security depends on all elements of our power – including strong and principled diplomacy.”
随着地区冲突越来越凸显出逊尼派-什叶派对峙的特征，什叶派占主导地位的伊朗将越来越难以在逊尼派占多数的国家形成影响力。	As regional conflicts are increasingly defined along Sunni-Shia lines, it is becoming more difficult for Shia-dominated Iran to gain influence in Sunni-majority countries.
他们目睹了极端天气事件可能对家庭，基础设施和人民生计造成的破坏，并且他们听到气候科学家警告说情况只会恶化。	They see the damage extreme weather events can inflict on homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods, and they hear climate scientists’ warnings that conditions will only deteriorate.
未来30年，由于每年0.5%的人口递减率，即便希腊人均收入以德国1.5%的水平增长，债务仍将难以偿还。	With its population set to contract by 0.5% annually over the next 30 years, even if per capita income in Greece were to rise at the German rate of 1.5% per year, the debt would be difficult to service.
如今，理论天平大概回到了国家行为可以收拾市场混乱的信条上，正如紧随20世纪20年代的市场崇拜之后出现的是国家崇拜。	Now the intellectual pendulum may be swinging back to the belief that state action can mop up markets’ messes – just as veneration of the state in the 1930’s followed market worship in the 1920’s.
毕竟，如果普京成功地将乌克兰变成陷入长期冲突的失败国家，他会在从爱沙尼亚到希腊的整个欧盟边境试图达到同样的目的。	After all, if Putin succeeds in turning Ukraine into a failed state with a frozen conflict embedded within it, he will seek the same outcome all along the EU’s borders, from Estonia to Greece.
相比而言，新保守主义的追随者对于埃德蒙德·柏克所称的连接“逝去的人、活着的人和尚未出生的人”的纽带毫无兴趣。	By contrast, neo-conservatism’s adherents are unconcerned with what Edmund Burke called the ties that bind “the dead, the living, and the yet unborn.”
这一协议需要跟进，即努力结束对巴勒斯坦的经济和行政制裁以及与以色列展开严肃认真的谈判以结束对约旦河西岸以及加沙地带长达39年的占领。	The agreement needs to be followed by an effort to end the economic and administrative siege of Palestine, as well as serious peace talks with Israel aimed at ending the 39-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
国会对美联储处理危机的手段大加责难，而认为美联储的存在本身就是违宪的德克萨斯州参议员罗恩·保罗将在1月接掌相关国会监察委员会。	Congress has disparaged the Fed’s handling of the crisis, and Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who believes that the Fed’s very existence is unconstitutional, will take over one of the key congressional oversight committees in January.
这只是三大盟国 — — 德国、荷兰和美国 — — 所部属的六个爱国者导弹基地其中之一。 这六个基地保护着土耳其南部叙利亚边境上的数百万人民。	This is just one of six Patriot batteries from three Allied countries – Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States – providing protection for millions of people along Turkey’s southeastern border with Syria.
除了分配和交易温室气体（主要是碳和“碳等价物 ” ） 排放许可外 ， “ 互助税 ” （ solidarity levy）还可以用于机票以及对飞机和轮船燃料所征的税收。	Aside from allocating and trading greenhouse-gas (mainly carbon or “carbon equivalent”) emissions allowances, “solidarity levies” could be imposed on airplane tickets, and taxes imposed on aviation or ship fuel.
欧洲的“自动稳定器”尽管毫无疑问减轻了危机的影响，但如今也被认为不足以确保经济复苏（但大量证据表明正好相反 ） 。	While undoubtedly mitigating the impact of the crisis, Europe’s “automatic stabilizers” are now said to be enough to ensure recovery, despite strong evidence to the contrary.
实际上，报告谈到他有权独自决定军事开支和军事进口，每批准一项交易显然都会给他带来极为丰厚的回扣酬劳。	In effect, the report states, he has a monopoly on military spending and imports, apparently a rich source of kickbacks each time he approves a deal.
除了隔绝，其他问题还有如非洲的干旱（那里的农民依赖于降雨超过灌溉 ） ， 热带国家遭遇疟疾、登革热以及其它致命疾病的疾病负担。	In addition to isolation, other problems include droughts in Africa, where farmers depend on rainfall rather than irrigation, and high disease burdens in tropical countries suffering from malaria, dengue fever, and other killer diseases.
但是菲尔普斯选择了耶鲁大学，在那里他遇到了James Tobin 和Thomas Schelling。	But Phelps chose Yale, where he came into direct contact with James Tobin and Thomas Schelling.
在他看来这种做法会导致过度的产业流动性，令经济效率降低，因为企业只会一味追求利润而罔顾迁移对某个社区造成的影响。	Such practices, he argued, would lead to inefficiently high levels of industrial mobility, because corporations would pursue profits wherever they could, regardless of the impact on individual communities.
事实上，普京快刀斩乱麻地吞并克里米亚让欧洲各国政府对俄罗斯的态度迅速统一起来，其效果远好于数十次双边和多边会议。	Indeed, Putin’s swift move to annex Crimea has done more to harmonize European governments’ views on Russia than dozens of bilateral or multilateral meetings.
报告的建议包括加强性犯罪（包括性骚扰）惩罚、要求警官报告每一起强奸指控以及采取更多措施纠正普遍存在歧视妇女现象。	Among the report’s recommendations were stronger penalties for sex crimes, including harassment; a requirement that police officers report every instance of alleged rape; and broader measures to address pervasive discrimination against women.
金融动荡风险卷土重来凸显出第四个、也是最后一个结果：危机的主要引发者没能以可信、可持续和对社会负责得分方式重新振作起来。	Renewed risks of financial instability point to the fourth and final surprise: the failure to recast major contributors to the crisis in a credible, sustainable, and socially responsible manner.
环境项目援助占双边援助的比例从1980年的5%左右增加到今天的近30 % ， 相当于每年250美元。	Aid for environmental projects has increased from about 5% of measured bilateral aid in 1980 to almost 30% today, bringing the annual total to about $25 billion.
当环节之间联系不过分紧时，规范机制有可能会更加稳定，而在眼下，一个涵盖一切的联合国条约可能不利于这一灵活性。	A regime of norms may be more robust when linkages are not too tight, and an over-arching UN treaty would harm such flexibility at this point.
最终欧盟在1999年通过了禁止密集笼箱养鸡的禁令，但为了让禽蛋生产商们能有足够的时间来逐步淘汰这些设备，最后的生效日期被推迟到了今年1月1日。	A ban on battery cages in the EU was eventually adopted in 1999, but, to ensure that producers would have plenty of time to phase out the equipment in which they had invested, its implementation was delayed until January 1, 2012.
例如，西班牙“我们可以”党最初的选举策略建构师伊尼戈·埃雷宏（Íñigo Errejón）的博士论文就是关于莫拉莱斯的崛起 — — 他本人也公开表示过对莫拉莱斯的敬佩。	For example, Íñigo Errejón, the architect of Podemos’s original electoral strategy, wrote his doctoral thesis on the rise of Morales, whom he openly admires.
该国西南边境与南高加索和土耳其处于同一纬度，这两个国家都已经是这一政策的国家，而土耳其还是欧盟成员候选国。	The country’s southwest edge is on the same longitude as the countries of the south Caucasus and Turkey, all of which are already ENP countries or in the case of Turkey an EU candidate.
他们希望这个体系能在允许本国稀缺工人合法入境的同时阻止非法偷渡；取缔那些剥削移民的雇主；并为移民融入当地社区提供资源。	They want a system that allows for the legal entry of needed workers, while preventing illegal entry; clamps down on exploitative employers; and provides resources to integrate immigrants into communities.
在国际关系中，现实主义是一种将国家视为中心行为者和分析单位，同时将国际机构和法律置于辅助地位的理论。	In international relations, realism is a theory that regards states as the central actors and units of analysis, relegating international institutions and law to an ancillary status.
我们必须相信科学方法，这样才能看清不确定的世界，才能帮助我们如何最好地抚育和保护我们的孩子和我们自身。	We must trust in it to help make sense of an uncertain world, and to help us determine how best to nourish and protect our children and ourselves.
欧盟是世界最大经济体，其年度GDP超过15.5万亿欧元（21.3万亿美元 ） ， 同时欧盟也是世界最大的贸易体，占全球贸易的20 % 。	The EU is the world’s largest economy, with annual GDP of more than €15.5 trillion ($21.3 trillion), and its greatest trading power, accounting for 20% of world trade.
但我们如何将这类创新与激光、晶体管、图灵机和人类基因组图谱这样的创新相比？ 后四者都带来了如潮水般的变革型产品。	But how can we compare these innovations with those like the laser, the transistor, the Turing machine, and the mapping of the human genome, each of which has led to a flood of transformative products?
这种以达卡国际腹泻疾病研究中心为主研发的口服溶液从二十世纪六十年代以来挽救了世界各地约4，000万人的生命，并被称为二十世纪一项最重要的医疗发明。	That solution, which icddr,b played a central role in developing, has prevented an estimated 40 million deaths globally since the 1960s, and has been called one of the most important medical inventions of the twentieth century.
以货币和财政政策为例，尽管几十年来我们都小心收集数据并进行数学和统计学研究，在很多大问题上我们也只不过是比一般经验知道得多一点而已。	Consider monetary and fiscal policies. Despite decades of careful data collection and mathematical and statistical research, on many large questions we have little more than rules of thumb.
其不断的扩张导致了气候变化、森林采伐、生物多样性损失和人权侵犯 — — 而这都是为了满足西方对廉价肉食的不健康胃口。	Its remorseless expansion is contributing to climate change, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and human-rights violations – all to satisfy Western societies’ unhealthy appetite for cheap meat.
当时此举对于大多数参与国来说都是合情合理的：支撑各国负债的真正因素有三：政府的税基，高度发展完善的体制，以及相对稳定的政治局势。	The sales made sense at the time for most of the participating countries: The real backing for their debt was the tax reach of their governments, their high levels of institutional development, and their relative political stability.
当然，跨国恐怖分子通常没有“回复地址”以使得相互威慑的恐吓能够奏效，但是北���鲜或伊朗在道德上没有权利将这种风险强加于别人身上。	Of course, transnational terrorists usually have no “return address” that allows the threat of mutual deterrence to work, but North Korea or Iran has no moral right to impose this risk upon others.
比如，一项最新研究强调G-20领导人没能在2008年危机后给出一致的、可实现的金融监管日程实施路线图。	For example, a recent study highlighted the failure of G-20 leaders to define a consistent and achievable roadmap for implementing the financial-reform agenda announced after the 2008 crisis.
货币市场领域，非洲金融共同体法郎区各成员国废除了在法统期将他们合为一体的联邦制，转而设立了贸易壁垒。	On the monetary front, the CFA Franc Zone’s member countries dismantled the federal structure that united them during French occupation and erected trade barriers instead.
多年来，国际货币基金组织让其成员国参与到“监控”的进程之中。 在这一进程中，国际货币基金组织监视、分析并且会商各国的经济政策。	For many years, the IMF has engaged its member countries in a process known as “surveillance,” in which it monitors, analyzes, and consults on each country’s economic policies – both exchange rate policies and relevant domestic policies.
前美联储主席沃克尔在会议中指出，答案在于我们应该回到起点 — — 2008年9月雷曼兄弟倒闭所引起的恐慌和信用市场冻结。	The answer, as former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker implied at the meeting, is that we would be right back where we started – in the panic and frozen credit markets that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
如果领导人足够勇敢，想要在不到一年的时间里废止大面额纸币，他们可以向试图大量兑换纸币的任何人提出尖锐的问题。	If leaders are brave and want to invalidate a high-denomination note in less than one year, they can ask tough questions of anyone who tries to exchange a large quantity of them.
因此，美国需要一位把美国放在第一位、知道如何在每一次机会中如何获得最佳协议、用美国的全部力量推进它的利益的总统。	It follows that the US needs a president who will put America first and knows how to extract the best deals for it at every opportunity, using the country’s full might to advance its interests.
美国银行在美联储金融压力测试中表现差劲，而监管者则在批评高盛和摩根大通的融资计划，导致两者调低了计划中的分红和股票回购。	Bank of America performed poorly on the US Federal Reserve’s financial stress tests, and regulators criticized Goldman Sachs’ and JPMorgan Chase’s financing plans, leading both to lower their planned dividends and share buybacks.
但要想充分利用数据共享，捐助者还应当转变他们的思维方式并在项目实施过程中加强对高质量数据和数据搜集管理工作的投资，同时为数据集的管理和数据分析提供资金支持。	Yet, to make the most of data sharing, donors should also shift their mindset and invest more in quality data collection and management during project implementation, and sustain funding for curation and continued analysis of datasets.

过去几个月来，美国的报纸和杂志一直在鼓吹长达10年之久的房价上涨也许即将结束，泡沫的破灭也许就在眼前。	In the United States, newspapers and magazines are trumpeting reports in the last few months that the decade-long boom in home prices may be at an end, and that the bubble may be bursting.
相反，在英国，最大额罚金以补偿金的形式付给了买有支付保护保险（Payment Protection Insurance）的个人按揭借款人。	In the UK, by contrast, the biggest penalties have come in the form of compensation payments made to individual mortgage borrowers who were sold Payment Protection Insurance.
与毒品交易不同，合法化不会使很多问题迎刃而解���但是它们所面对的情况却是类似的，因为经济都在这里扮演了一个比人们通常认为的更重要的角色。	Unlike the drug trade, legalization would not make much of the problem go away, but the issue is similar, because economics plays a much bigger role than is generally acknowledged.
随着气候的变化，与天气有关的灾害，比如洪水、飓风、塌方和台风等，频率、烈度和持续时间都会增加，影响到个人的生计和整体经济。	As the climate changes, weather-related calamities such as floods, hurricanes, landslides, and typhoons will increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, undermining individual livelihoods and the broader economy.
在媒体记者和保安人员的一阵混乱中，他们拦住了海牙国际刑事法庭负责前南问题的首席检察官迪旁蒂（Carla Del Ponte ） 。	In a flurry of media and security, they confronted Carla Del Ponte, chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague.
在马拉维布兰太尔的乔伊斯·班达基金会学校，教育工作者采用了基于四个基本要素的课程：普世价值，全球认知，为人类造福和追求卓越。	At the Joyce Banda Foundation School in Blantyre, Malawi, educators have adopted a curriculum based on four building blocks: universal values, global understanding, service to humanity, and excellence.
不仅如此，激进的青年人到波斯尼亚、车臣、阿富汗或克什米尔参战，而不是留在他们生长的国家，因为他们没有把中东看作被十字军围困的穆斯林文化中心。	Moreover, young radicals go to fight in Bosnia, Chechnya, Afghanistan, or Kashmir rather than in their countries of origin, because they do not regard the Middle East as the heart of a Muslim civilization under siege by crusaders.
所幸的是该领域的其他专家确实希望追寻其中的关联，也经历了五年的历练。 在这五年里，经济模型所预测的那些一百万年才发生一次的价格运动在一周内就能出现几次。	Fortunately, others in the profession do aspire to relevance, and they have been chastened by the events of the last five years, when price movements that the models predicted should occur once in a million years were observed several times a week.
正是我们对欧洲的信心，作为促进和平与繁荣的催化剂，使我们与土耳其达成和解，并支持其加入欧盟的渴望。 当泛希腊社会主义运动（PASOK）政府在我担任外交部长期间出台其希腊-土耳其睦邻友好的政策时，许多人都对这一与夙敌修好的政策表示怀疑。	Greece and Turkey have signed eighteen mutually beneficial agreements in areas ranging from trade and energy, to environmental protection and the fight against organized crime.

比如美国主导的马歇尔计划的目的不仅仅是支援二战后西欧重建，同时也是为了恢复美国的出口市场并抗衡苏联。	The US-led Marshall Plan was aimed not just at supporting the reconstruction of Western Europe after World War II, but also at reviving markets for US exports and containing the Soviet Union.
去年经济学家安妮·凯斯和安格斯·迪顿的一项重要研究显示，美国受教育程度较低的中年白人男性死亡率大幅上升，某些观察家将其称之为“绝望的死亡”浪潮。	According to a major study by the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton last year, the mortality rate for middle-aged, less-educated white men in the US has been surging, in what some observers have called a wave of “despair deaths.”
如果鼓励选民反思他们这辈子最重大的政治决定继续被视为对民主的背叛，那么英国将失去对永久性自残的唯一的保护。	If encouraging voters to think again about the biggest political decision of their lifetimes continues to be treated as an affront to democracy, the UK will lose its only safeguard against permanent self-harm.
问题不仅出现在印尼、墨西哥和巴西等新兴市场国家，那里日益壮大的左翼势力未能找出可行的方法来替代备受攻诘的经济自由化“华盛顿共识 ” 。	The problem is not just in emerging markets such as Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil, where an ascendant left has failed to find a viable alternative to the much reviled “Washington Consensus” of economic liberalization.

在领导印度独立并独掌大权数十年的国大党执政政府中愈演愈烈的腐败现象表明政治已经成为一个怎样有利可图的职业。	Increasing corruption within governments run by the Congress party, which led India to independence and monopolized political power for decades, showed what a lucrative career politics had become.
到2007年底为止已经有超过600个生产组织 — — 代表58个国家的140万农民 — — 在销售公平贸易产品。	By the end of 2007, more than 600 producers’ organizations, representing 1.4 million farmers in 58 countries, were selling fair-trade products.
我们知道当不同宗教信仰的群众为了更广泛的群体利益而走到一起，他们对对方的了解能够有助于抵御极端分子的诱惑。	We know that when people of different religions work together for the good of the wider community, they come to understand one another in a way that helps them resist the call of extremists.

剑桥 — — 随着全球经济形势逐渐稳定，一种担忧之声不断渐渐响起：美国和中国是否会重复走经济危机发生之前的老路，如果这样的话，这不仅关系到美中之间，整个世界都会处于危险之中。	CAMBRIDGE – As the global economy stabilizes, there is a growing danger that the United States and China will slip back into their pre-crisis economic patterns, placing themselves and the rest of the world at risk.
日常的钓鱼行为可以影响任何市场，但我们最重要的观察则在于金融市场 — — 考虑到2009年以来大规模的资产和地产市场泡沫，以及上个月以来全球资产市场的混乱，也是是时候这样做了。	Routine phishing can affect any market, but our most important observations concern financial markets – timely enough, given the massive boom in the equity and real-estate markets since 2009, and the turmoil in global asset markets since last month.
但是美国的社会保障体系却能提供一种私有化无法提供的保险形式，保证个人不受市场和通货膨胀各种风险的影响。	America’s Social Security system insulates individuals against the vagaries of the market and inflation, providing a form of insurance that the private market does not offer.
在最近的马拉喀什气候会议（COP22）上，人们的注意力集中在特朗普政府的众多可能扼杀去年在巴黎COP21上所形成的气候协定的行动上。	At the recent climate conference meeting (COP 22) in Marrakesh, attention focused on the various ways a Trump administration might kill the climate agreement reached at COP 21 in Paris last year.
然而，人们倾向于在完成这个过程中，对这些方法怎样－或者是是否－注入更多的社会、文化甚至经济相关性没有太多的考虑。	Yet, this agenda tends to be pursued without much concern for how – or if – these measures feed into something of greater social, cultural, and even economic relevance.
那次旱灾，加之不可持续的农业耕作和糟糕的资源管理，导致150万叙利亚人在国内流离失所，并催化了2011年起义爆发前的政治动荡局势。	That drought, together with unsustainable agricultural practices and poor resource management, contributed to the internal displacement of 1.5 million Syrians and catalyzed political unrest ahead of the 2011 uprising.
通过任命新的美联储主席（或重新任命珍妮特·耶伦）以及其他美联储执行委员, 下任总统会对利率、 汇率和全球金融市场产生间接影响。	By appointing a new Fed Chair (or reappointing Janet Yellen), and possibly other Fed governors, the next president will have an indirect influence on interest rates, exchange rates, and global financial markets.
IMF的贷款都是短期的，因此有激励忽视紧缩的影响，从而实现增长预测，而实现增长预测意味着有偿付能力。	Because the IMF lends money on a short-term basis, there was an incentive to ignore the effects of austerity in order to arrive at growth projections that imply an ability to repay.
此外，许多新兴市场国家已经注意到，和20世纪90年代及21世纪初它们所得到的资金相比，如今注入欧洲的数千亿美元所附带的条件可要宽松多了。	Moreover, many emerging-market countries have noted that the policy conditionality attached to the tens of billions of dollars that have been shipped to Europe pales in comparison with what was imposed on them in the 1990’s and early 2000’s.
他们并没有试图回到迭戈·加西亚岛，因为该岛至今还是美国军事禁区，租约持续到2016年 — — 而且依然在西方国家安全和防御方面扮演重要的角色。	They have never sought to resettle on Diego Garcia, which remains off-limits and leased to the US government until 2016 – and continues to play a vital role in Western security and defense.
这三个国家都在经历重大政治转型 — — 或者是新领导人选举，或者是领导人的关键决定 — — 全球经济的未来也迎来了决定形时刻。	With all three undergoing significant political transitions – whether electing a new leader or experiencing a recently installed leader’s first key decisions – this is a decisive moment in shaping the global economy’s future.
决策者将这一挑战简单化了，他们专注于NCD越来越普遍的发生 — — 即罹患疾病人数的陡峭增加，但我认为，真正的问题并不在这里。	Policymakers have oversimplified the challenge by focusing on the growing prevalence of NCDs – the sheer number of people with these diseases – which, I argue, is not really the problem.
现有政府只有在历史理由充分、证据确凿且拥有民众广泛支持的情况下才能同意考虑建国要求，而且拟议中的新实体必须具有可行性。	Existing governments would agree to consider bids for statehood only in cases where there was a historical justification, a compelling rationale, and popular support, and where the proposed new entity is viable.
这些结论并不意味着男人和女人不应努力调整各自的愿望，要求分担家务劳动的责任，或期望“有人听自己说话 ” 。	None of this means that men and women should not try to adjust to each other's wishes, ask for shared responsibility with housework, or expect to be “heard.”
正如金砖银行拒绝西方主导的经济机构，发展中经济体可以很好地驱逐外国银行并允许地方金融机构为生产性目的创造货币。	Just as the BRICS have rejected Western-led economic institutions, developing economies would do well to expel foreign banks and allow local financial institutions to create money for productive purposes.
也可建立一套科学公开透明的基本推定，同时在有真正风险时，在科学知识可能被用来造成严重伤害时，考虑到意外情况的发生。	It can also establish a basic presumption of scientific openness and transparency, while allowing for exceptions when there is a real risk that scientific knowledge could be used to cause serious harm.
目前已不确定是否是美国盟友，但依然是北约成员国的土耳其或许太过关注国内政治动荡而无暇顾及到对策的细节。	Turkey – an uncertain US ally nowadays, yet still a NATO member – may be too preoccupied with domestic political turmoil to respond in detail.
美元开始疲软前，25个欧盟成员国的年出口增长率是6.5 % ， 对应的消费增长是2 % ， 投资增幅为3 % 。	Before the dollar started to weaken, exports from the 25 EU member states were growing at 6.5% per year, compared with 2% for consumption and 3% for investment.
以圣战组织的兴盛为例，包括仍在蚕食伊拉克和叙利亚领土的伊斯兰国和在尼日利亚实施野蛮绑架、轰炸和谋杀的博科圣地（Boko Haram）组织。	Consider the proliferation of jihadist groups, such as the Islamic State, which continues to seize territory in Iraq and Syria, and Boko Haram, which has been engaged in a brutal campaign of abductions, bombings, and murder in Nigeria.
第四，它们让操作员得以利用大量数据，有助于管理工作流、提供情境、实现持续学习、改善预测、改进经营效率。	Fourth, they allow their operators to make sense of large amounts of data, helping manage workflows, providing context, and allowing for continuous learning, better forecasting, and improved operational effectiveness.
坎布里奇—今年年底，世界贸易体系将面临重要转折点，这个转折点因为近15年前中国加入世贸组织而延迟到现在。	CAMBRIDGE – The global trade system faces an important turning point at the end of this year, one that was postponed when China joined the World Trade Organization almost 15 years ago.
这就是为何它努力要将温度上升幅度限制在1.5摄氏度 — — 得益于论坛的努力，在这项内容也被涵盖于巴黎协定内。	That is why it has fought to limit the rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees – an ambition that was included, thanks to the forum’s efforts, in the Paris agreement.
目前，特朗普正在加倍下注 — — 还威胁要关闭政府，甚至赖掉联邦债务，除非国会为他承诺不会给美国纳税人造成任何成本的高墙拨款。	Now, Trump is doubling down – and threatening to shut down the government, or even default on the federal debt, unless Congress provides funding for a wall that he promised would cost US taxpayers nothing.
但由于日常体验把中国公民置于一个相比西方高管绝对有利的位置去评估中国官员及其行为，因此人们必然得出结论说前者基本上是完全正确的。	But, given that daily experience places Chinese citizens in an infinitely better position than Western executives to evaluate Chinese officials and their conduct, one would have to conclude that they are almost certainly right.
但这种说法的错误在于假定与生活在独裁政权中的人们相比，开放社会的公民更纵容恐怖活动，也更容易遭受恐怖分子的袭击。	The mistake, however, is to assume that open societies are more permissive and vulnerable to terrorism than those who live under authoritarian regimes.
去年所实施的全球卫生、赋权和权利法案（Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights Act，HER法）禁止收取美国援助的外国非政府组织采取限制性资格要求。	The Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights Act (HER Act), introduced last year, would prohibit the application of restrictive eligibility requirements for foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive US assistance.
如果金融公司资本金偏低，也就是说股东投进赌局里的本钱并不多，他们就会鼓励CEO和银行家多用杠杆多冒风险，因为就算赌输了，他们自己也不会蚀多少老本。	If financial institutions do not have enough capital, and shareholders don’t have enough of their own skin in the game, they will push CEOs and bankers to take on too much leverage and risks, because their own net worth is not at stake.
20多年前，时任美联储主席格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）开始指出，美国GDP增长不再主要由试图获得更多东西的消费者驱动。	More than 20 years ago, Alan Greenspan, then-Chair of the US Federal Reserve, started pointing out that GDP growth in the US was becoming less driven by consumers trying to acquire more stuff.
欧洲人很容易把他们自己的历史投射到亚洲身上，并把现在的发展看作不过是对欧洲曾经发生过的事情的一种重复，如果不是模仿的话。	It is tempting for Europeans to project their own history onto Asia and to view current developments there as a mere repetition, if not an imitation, of what occurred in Europe.
2010年以来，这两个条件左右着整个如何巩固欧元的讨论，也是成立欧洲银行联盟迟迟得不到进展的主要原因。	Since 2010, these two refrains have shaped the entire discussion of how to shore up the euro, and they largely account for the anemic progress being made on the creation of a European banking union.
布雷顿森林体系将美元与黄金挂钩（35美元兑1盎司黄金 ） ， 其他货币则与美元挂钩（偶尔也允许调整 ） 。	The Bretton Woods system linked the US dollar to gold at $35 per ounce, with other currencies linked to the dollar (though occasionally allowed to make adjustments).
尽管上述印象不尽准确 — — 也许恰恰因为不准确，鲁哈尼政府为核谈判和政治解决叙利亚问题提供了一个意想不到的机会。	Despite these perceptions – or perhaps precisely because of them – Rowhani’s presidency offers an unexpected opportunity for both the nuclear negotiations and a political solution in Syria.
无论哪种情况出现，长期利率的上升将会抑制复苏，而货币供应大幅度增加会导致通货膨胀的前景很可能导致一个时期的滞涨。	Either way, a rise in long-term interest rates is liable to choke off the recovery. The prospect of the greatly increased money supply turning into inflation is likely to lead to a period of stagflation.
在这样的背景下，欧洲法院（European Court of Justice）的最新裁决是一个巨大的隐患。 该裁决承认“被忘记的权利 ” ， 因此要求谷歌按要求移除搜索信息 — — 即使是合法的。	In this context, the European Court of Justice’s recent ruling, which recognizes a “right to be forgotten” – and thus requires Google to remove search information, even when legal, on demand – represents a significant danger.
不管在国家电视台还是在政府控制的报纸上 — — 那时候还没有言论自由、互联网和有线电视新闻 — — 埃及人民看到的是埃及已夺回命运主动权的豪言壮语。	Whether on state television or in government-controlled newspapers – at the time, there was no free press, Internet, or cable news – citizens were reassured that Egypt had regained control of its destiny.
其中压力最大的是所谓“脆弱五国 ” — —巴西、印度、印尼，南非以及土耳其（1月份爆发小型危机的阿根廷并未计算在内 ） 。	Pressure has been strongest on the so-called “Fragile Five”: Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey (not counting Argentina, where January’s mini-crisis started).
上周两名内阁部长辞职之后，议会和媒体还在穷追猛打，他们指控一名内阁部长在萨科奇的总统竞选筹款中涉嫌腐败。	But the constitution established by General Charles de Gaulle is strong, and Sarkozy will keep his position until the end of his mandate in 2012. The main opposition Socialist Party’s weak electoral prospects are also helping Sarkozy.
面对日益严峻的全球失序 — — 包括中东动荡、涌入欧洲的难民潮和中国的单方面领土主张 — — 联合国还有未来吗？	In the face of growing global disorder – including turmoil in the Middle East, waves of migrants flooding into Europe, and China’s unilateral moves to enforce its territorial claims – does the UN have a future?
比如，但国家根据结果（比如儿童接种疫苗的数量或比例）向私人部门支付时，我们了解到问责性和结果都得到了改善。	For example, when the state pays the private sector based on outcomes (for example, the number or share of vaccinated children), both accountability and results have been known to improve.
特朗普政府希望我们相信，在总统放松管制，大规模减税和大幅扩大国防开支的推动下经济增长加速，带动了美元升值。	The Trump administration would like us to believe that the dollar’s rise reflects faster economic growth, driven by the president’s agenda of deregulation, massive tax cuts, and substantially expanded defense spending.
今年惠普也采用了这种方式，之前采取同样方式的还有Sprint和Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia。	This year, HP joined Sprint and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia down this road.
这些差异部分解释了为何英国不愿参与欧洲银行联盟，而一些其他非欧元区国家则急切地想加入其中，担心若非如此，它们可能被实际排除在欧洲央行决策之外。	These differences may partly explain the UK’s reluctance to participate in the European banking union, while some other non-eurozone countries are keen to join it, fearing that, otherwise, they might be effectively excluded from ECB policymaking.
尽管贬值的欧元不会增加它们相对于德国和其他欧元区国家的竞争力，但可以改善它们相对非欧元区国家的竞争力。	Although a weaker euro would not increase their competitiveness relative to Germany and other eurozone countries, it would improve their competitiveness relative to all non-eurozone countries.
在两轮选举之间，下列简单思想深入选民之心：国民阵线可以随心所欲地改变它的面貌，但它从未成为、现在不是、将来也不可能变成正常的政党。	Between the two rounds, the following simple idea sank in among the electorate: The National Front can revamp its façade all it wants, but it has never been, is not, and can never be a normal party.
如果推行（和尚未推行）国家宽带计划的110个国家有意就上例进行过专门的思考，我们实现积极变革的可能性就会大幅度增加。	If these examples were deliberately and specifically considered by the 110 countries that have national broadband plans (and those that still do not), we would be much more likely to achieve the positive transformations that we all want.
有关石油峰值的争论把公众的注意力引向了错误的话题，而不是将目光集中在石油工业所面临的主要长期与短期挑战之上。	Rather than focusing on the major short- and long-term challenges facing the oil industry, the debate about peak oil diverts attention to the wrong problems.
这意味着成员国的某部分债务将会被重组：单一政府的债务将变成欧洲债券，并因此产生一个所有成员国共同承担的联合责任。	It means that some portion of members’ debts will be mutualized: individual governments’ debts would become Eurobonds, and thus a joint obligation of all members.
大选前三天。 温和派阵营中唯一的其他候选人阿里夫（Mohammad Reza Aref）应哈塔米要求退出竞争。	Three days before the election, the only other candidate in the moderate camp, Mohammad Reza Aref, dropped out of the race at Khatami’s request.
他们在委内瑞拉24个州中的每一个组织代表大会，并邀请了超过12，000名代表参加。 而且，在11月26日，他们召集了一次全国性活动，发表了一份宣言具体描绘了重回民主的路线图。	They have organized congresses in each of Venezuela’s 24 states, attended by over 12,000 delegates, and, on November 26, they held a national event to issue a manifesto delineating a path back to democracy.
股权相关头寸（包括外国直接投资和投资组合）目前已占到跨国资本流动的69 % ， 而2007年这一数据仅仅为36 % 。	Equity-related positions (FDI plus portfolio investments) now account for 69% of cross-border capital flows, up from 36% in 2007.
这一冻结行动包括一项“环境评估 ” ， 它比较清楚地表明了文在寅意欲在国家安全和朝鲜政策上拥有更大的主动权。	The freeze, which includes an “environmental review,” is a none-too-veiled signal to expect more assertiveness on national security and North Korea policy.
欧盟内部的问题及其没完没了的主权债务危机显然与其制度疲软大有关系，欧洲外围国家民主制度不够坚挺也是原因之一。	The European Union’s internal problems, and its ongoing sovereign-debt crisis, are clearly linked to the weakness of its institutions, and, on Europe’s periphery, it still confronts feckless democracies.
前执政党Fretilin和由抵抗印尼占领的英雄Xanana Gusmão领导的新组建的CNRT 都没有获得压倒性多数。	Neither the former ruling party, Fretilin, nor the newly formed CNRT, led by Xanana Gusmão, the hero of the resistance to Indonesia’s occupation, won an outright majority.
无论是中国还是日本，党派大佬消灭恼人对手的方式就是通过公众丑闻让他们倒台，先把消息透露给手下俯首帖耳的媒体，然后再煽风点火。	The way that party bosses, in China no less than in Japan, get rid of irksome rivals is to bring them down through public scandals, leaked to an obedient press, which then fans the flames.
再举个例子，十九世纪初最富有的人、纳丹·梅耶·罗斯柴尔德（Nathan Mayer Rothschild）五十多岁时就因为浓重感染而死亡。	To take one more example, the richest man in the early nineteenth century, Nathan Mayer Rothschild, died in his fifties from an infected abscess.
尽管有英国脱欧冲击、中东和朝鲜半岛疑云、反覆无常的美国总统特朗普等事件，但投资和工资的增长以及失业率的下降似乎就在眼前。	Despite the shock of Brexit, storm clouds over the Middle East and Korean Peninsula, and US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable behavior, rising investment and wages, alongside falling rates of unemployment, appeared to be in the offing.
实现这一目标并不一定要加重税收，但我们可以说服有钱人无休无止地追求物质利益对提高自身生活质量既没有必要也无法持久。	We need not impose more taxes to achieve this, but we can persuade the wealthy that the eternal pursuit of material gain is both unsustainable and unnecessary for their own quality of life.
中国基本上可以毫无限制地进入发达国家市场，因此可以充分利用全球外需并提升其GDP增长潜力，这正是中国过去二十年来做法。	With nearly unlimited access to advanced-country markets, China can tap into global external demand and raise its GDP growth potential, as it has done for the past two decades.
事实上，从1989年欧洲共产主义失败到俄罗斯和西方冲突重燃，可以说历史在四分之一个世纪的时间里完成了一个完整的循环。	In fact, history could be said to have come full circle in the space of a quarter-century, from the fall of communism in Europe in 1989 to renewed confrontation between Russia and the West.
但是，令人悲哀的现实是，尽管由诸多发展伙伴和出资国的支持，但对生殖健康和计划生育的援助在过去十年中下降了一半。	However, the sad reality is that, despite support from various development partners and donors, assistance for reproductive health care and family planning fell by half in the last decade.
这一表述脱胎自在1992年教皇若望·保禄二世《天主教教理问答》中，它说 ， “ 让动物受苦或毫无必要地死去有悖于人类尊严 。 ”	That statement, which originally appeared in the Catechism of the Catholic Church issued by Pope John Paul II in 1992, calls it “contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die needlessly.”
随着这种向身份政治 — — 这是一个不是特别容易实现妥协的领域 — — 的转变，人们对民主体制的态度也发生了转变。	With the shift toward identity politics – a terrain that is not particularly amenable to compromise – has come a shift in attitudes toward democratic institutions.
托马斯·杰菲逊认为伊利运河项目是疯狂之举，但这条运河以现值计算约1，000亿美元的成本却相对较快地得到了回收。	Thomas Jefferson thought that the Erie Canal project was madness, yet its cost – around $100 billion in today’s dollars – was recouped relatively quickly.
“在任何一个给定时间 ， ” 作者们写道 ， “ 都有数百万人存在偶然失去饭碗、寻找工作的可能性，而在衰退和经济减速时期，这些数字还会飙升 。 ”	“At any given time,” the authors write, “millions of people are likely to be out of jobs involuntarily and looking for work, and in times of recession and economic slowdown, those numbers will spike.”
在更加开放的体系中，阿拉伯政府需要实现国有控股企业私有化，同时大大降低企业家注册初创企业和开创全新业务的难度。	In a more open system, Arab governments will need to privatize many state-controlled companies, and make it far easier for entrepreneurs to register start-ups and launch new businesses.
毕竟，如果美国在过去的一年里让IMF配额改革再次无功而返，它基本上就将全球经济领导力的钥匙传给了中国。	After all, if the United States had let yet another year go by without ratifying the IMF quota reform, it would have essentially handed over the keys of global economic leadership to China.
正是印度储备银行的地位和独立性帮助了帕特尔及其副手 — — 如同他们的前任一样 — — 驾驭该机构穿越了众多经济和政治雷区。	It helps the RBI’s stature and independence that Patel and his lieutenants, like their predecessors, are experienced at navigating the RBI through economic and political minefields.
当然，绑架的实施者 — — 博科圣地（Boko Haram）领袖丧心病狂的话只是这一意识形态最极端的代表。	Of course, the hideous and crazed words of the leader of Boko Haram, the group that kidnapped the girls, are representative only of the most extreme fringe of this ideology.
事实上，新兴国家大多已经认识到全面战略的需要，将定向政策与深层次结构性改革相协调，从而开发新的增长源。	Indeed, emerging countries have largely recognized the need for a comprehensive strategy, comprising targeted policies and deep structural reforms, to develop new sources of growth.
一方面各国都本能地欢庆并支持民主在地中海沿岸推行的局面，但另一方面又被危机可能蔓延到欧洲的恐惧所困扰。	The natural instinct to celebrate and support democratization across the Mediterranean has been tempered by concerns that the crisis will spill onto European shores.
用特朗普最爱的赤字和盈余的说法讲，美国可能因为开发商的交易而产生5,000万美元的“货币赤字 ” ， 但会实现价值5,000万美元的“商品盈余 ” 。	To use the language of deficits and surpluses that so trips up Trump, the US might have a “currency deficit” of $50 million following the developer’s transaction, but it would also have a “goods surplus” worth $50 million.
即使一些作物被污染，活跃药物成分出现以足够大量出现在最终食品产品中、足以给人类健康造成负面影响的概率也十分低。	Even if some crops were to become contaminated, the chances that active drug substances would be present in the final food product at sufficient levels to have an adverse effect on human health would remain very small.
美国可以认为在墨西哥和哥伦比亚的缉毒战争取得了部分胜利，但中美洲的危险之处在于并不具备上述国家的制度弹性，从而使开辟新战线成为可能。	The US may view its war on drugs in Mexico and Colombia as partially successful; the danger is that Central America does not have those countries’ institutional resilience, leaving the way open for new fronts to be opened.
类似地，我们有空间取消税务对冲（taxing hedge）和以优惠税率对私募股权基金的“附带收益”征税的过时做法。	Likewise, there is scope for removing the antiquated practice of taxing hedge and private-equity funds’ “carried interest” at a preferential rate.
这种有利于各方的非正式协议事实上暴露了现行财政政策（即惩罚性营业税）可怕的低效率，以及资本管制是如何将其进一步放大的。	The fact that this informal deal benefits all sides exposes the terrible inefficiency of current fiscal policy (namely, punitive business taxes) and how capital controls magnify it.
此外，如果欧洲和中国想要跟它们所说的那样坚持以规则为基础的多边贸易体制，就不应把特朗普的单边主义做法复制到自己手中并且单打独斗。	Besides, if Europe and China want to uphold a rules-based multilateral trade regime, as they say they do, they cannot mirror Trump’s unilateralism and take matters into their own hands.
要想成功，亚洲领导人就必须排除外交干扰 — — 包括2012年有所加剧的地区领土纠纷 — — 进一步动摇已然不确定的经济和地缘政治环境。	To be successful, Asia’s leaders must not allow diplomatic distractions – including territorial disputes in the region, which intensified in 2012 – to destabilize further an already uncertain economic and geopolitical environment.
科学家是提供这份路线图的理想人选，因为他们知道如何提出正确的问题、设计实验、形成基于证据的结论，并将新信息应用到已知的知识中。	Scientists are well positioned to provide this roadmap, because they know how to ask the right questions, design experiments, draw evidenced-based conclusions, and apply new information to existing knowledge.
更多轮次正在进行中，一些问题 — — 包括监管透明度保证以及成立有效的纠纷解决机制 — — 仍未得到充分解决。	Many more rounds are on the way, as some significant issues – including guarantees of regulatory transparency and the creation of an effective dispute-settlement mechanism – have yet to be fully agreed.
降低公司税自然会被认为将推高股价，而降低个人所得税可能导致更高的住房价格（尽管其效果可能被税制的其他变化抵消 ） 。	Lower corporate taxes are naturally supposed to lead to higher share prices, while cuts in personal income tax might lead to higher home prices (though possibly offset by other changes in the tax system).
这样的努力在宗教层面得到绝大部分非叙利亚籍阿拉伯领导人的支持 — — 比如沙特阿拉伯的阿布杜拉·穆罕默赛 — — 叙利亚战斗人员并没有质疑他所颁布的宗教法令。	That effort is supported, on the religious side, by leaders who are largely non-Syrian Arabs – for example, Abdullah al-Muhaysini is from Saudi Arabia – whose religious edicts are not questioned by the largely Syrian fighters.
新加坡—明年是东盟成立五十周年。 东盟没能就中国的南海领土主张问题形成共识，这引起了整个地区的担忧。	SINGAPORE – As the Association of Southeast Asian Nations approaches its 50th anniversary next year, its failure to reach a consensus regarding Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea has raised concerns throughout the region.
但认为独裁主义的崛起完全来源于意识形态、或其代表了对民主、自由主义或人权及公民权利的普遍否定同样是一种误读。	Yet it is a mistake to think that the rise of autocrats is all about ideology, or that it represents a widespread rejection of democracy, liberalism, or human and civil rights.
这些影响在本已不稳定的情况下将尤其不稳定，导致诸如治理薄弱、经济不平等和社会紧张等挑战恶化 — — 并引发真正的高毒性冲突。	These effects will be particularly destabilizing in already-volatile situations, exacerbating challenges like weak governance, economic inequality, and social tensions – and producing truly toxic conflicts.
柏林—在经过了几个月的谈判后，德国正在形成新一届大联合政府 — — 由总理默克尔的基督教民主联盟（CDU）和不太情愿的社会民主党（SPD）组成。	BERLIN – After months of negotiations, another grand coalition government – comprising Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and a grudging Social Democratic Party (SPD) – is taking shape in Germany.
此外，建筑行业有各式各样的方法让无数人在风景胜地拥有自己的家，而他们所要做的不过是在当地建设更多高密度、高层次的公寓大楼。	Moreover, there are plenty of ways for the construction industry to offer untold millions more people the opportunity to call some beautiful place home, simply by building more high-density and high-rise vacation apartment buildings there.
马克龙预料到德国的反应，反驳道 ： “ 你不能说我支持强欧洲和全球化，但除非我死了，否则我就不支持转移支付联盟 。 ”	Anticipating the German reaction, Macron has countered it: “You cannot say I am for a strong Europe and globalization, but over my dead body for a transfer union.”
次贷危机后系统性地帮助金融企业脱困，已经令这种道德风险问题变得更加严重，就算为了避免全球金融崩溃有必要这样做。	The systematic bailouts of the latest crisis – however necessary to avoid a global meltdown – worsened this moral-hazard problem.
女性仍然肩负着巨大的家庭负担，而来自社会和文化规范的压力常常剥夺她们上学、创业或参与公共生活的机会。	Women still bear disproportionate domestic burdens, and pressures stemming from social and cultural norms often rob them of the chance to attend school, start businesses, or participate in public life.
但今天，随着中国企业正在开发属于自身的宝贵的知识产权，他们的全球轨迹逐渐变得更大、更强，而互惠的知识产权保护能够同样惠及中国企业和外国经营者。	Today, however, as China’s firms are developing their own valuable IP, and their global footprint has grown much larger, stronger and reciprocal IP protections would benefit Chinese firms as much as foreign companies.
只有当德国和波兰，会同其他较小的东欧成员国一起，主张对乌克兰实行“东方”睦邻政策，欧盟的整体策略才能表现出必要的力度和耐心。	Only if Germany and Poland, together with the smaller eastern member states, jointly advocate such an “eastern” and neighborhood policy towards Ukraine, will EU policy as a whole receive the necessary power and perseverance.
她也是现代以来英国最有争议的首相，崇拜者和憎恨者等量齐观，这既是拜她的自负路线所赐，也是因为政策本身。	She was also the most divisive British prime minister of modern times, admired and reviled in equal measure, owing as much to the self-righteous way she pursued her policies as to the policies themselves.
中国对取得俄罗斯亚洲部分的实际控制权也没有多少兴趣，尽管俄罗斯战略学者耸人听闻地说这才是中国真正的目标。	Nor do the Chinese have much interest in assuming de facto control of Asiatic Russia, despite shrieks from Russian strategic pundits that this is China’s real goal.
但最近在人工智能相关技术领域上的突破确实提供了从交通到教育和缉毒在内的一系列应用中爆发巨大积极进步的潜力。	But recent breakthroughs in AI-related technologies do offer enormous potential for positive advances in a range of applications from transportation to education and drug discovery.
因此目前正在落实计划，研究并分发相关的信息分析工具，发现其中的关联之处（资料勘察 ） ， 并以图形和表格的形式显示结果。	So there are plans afoot to develop and distribute tools to analyze information, discover correlations (data-mining), and display the results as graphs and charts.
其实从2000年启动以来，全球疫苗免疫联盟已经辅助4.4亿新增人口进行了预防接种，为挽救600万人的生命尽了一份力。	Indeed, since its launch in 2000, GAVI has already supported the vaccination of 440 million additional people, helping to save six million lives.
卡梅伦对欧盟的四个主要要求之一是英国可以背离统一规则的要素。 欧洲央行正在寻求将统一规则纳入欧元区银行联盟，以保证各国方针的一致性。	One of Cameron’s four major demands of the EU is a national derogation from elements of the uniform rulebook which the European Central Bank is seeking to introduce in the eurozone’s banking union to ensure a consistent approach across countries.
但塞申斯作为第一位支持特朗普的共和党参议员，正在十分愉快地取消公民权利等领域的大量奥巴马时代的保护法令，拒绝辞职。	But Sessions, the first Republican senator to endorse Trump, was enjoying rolling back numerous Obama-era protections in areas like civil rights, and refused to resign.
当前的中国领导层承诺要建立一个更为均衡的发展模式，并相信市场会在实现这一目标的过程中扮演“决定性的角色 ” 。	China’s current leadership is committed to building a more balanced model, and believes that the market must play a “decisive role” in achieving that.
19世纪的“无知 ” （ Know Nothing）运动便是建立在反对移民，特别是爱尔兰移民的基础上的。	The nineteenth-century “Know Nothing” movement was built on opposition to immigrants, particularly the Irish.
这次会谈标志着“科孚进程”的延续，该进程在欧洲安全与合作组织支持下，始于6月在科孚岛召开的非正式部长会议。	The talks mark the continuation of the “Corfu Process,” anchored in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which began with an informal ministerial meeting on Corfu in June.
此外，虽然信贷增长按照国际标准来说极高 — — 而这一关键指标暗示着潜在的危机 — — 其进一步刺激经济增长的效果却不断减弱。	Moreover, while credit growth is high by international standards – a key indicator of a potential crisis – its ability to spur further growth is diminishing.
埃德蒙顿 — — 就好比马塞诸塞殖民地民众不可能理性地探讨巫术一样，今天的人们也不可能平心静气地探讨环境问题。	EDMONTON – Calm discussion of the environment nowadays is about as plausible as reasoned dialogue on witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts.
哥斯达黎加的方法始于20世纪90年代的改革，当时，国家承诺要采取一些简单的改变，旨在升级其医疗服务。	Costa Rica’s approach began with reforms in the 1990s, when the country committed to a few simple changes designed to upgrade its health-care services.
许多参与时下这场不平等之争的人都会援引法国经济学家汤玛斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）2014年出版的著作《二十一世纪资本论 》 ， 并依此提出三个关键点。	Many of those engaged in the debate on inequality nowadays cite the French economist Thomas Piketty’s 2014 book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which makes three key points.
事实上，智能手机/平板的故事似乎是一个先兆，这些设备所创造的的财富会集中到极少数也许生活在遥远的国家的科技创业家手里。	This time, in fact, the smartphone/tablet story is associated with a sense of foreboding, for the wealth that these devices generate seems to be concentrated among a tiny number of tech entrepreneurs who probably live in a faraway country.
事实上，菲律宾（二战时被日本占领）前外交部长罗萨里奥（Albert del Rosario）如今强烈支持以重新武装的日本制衡中国。	Indeed, Albert del Rosario, the foreign minister of the Philippines, which was under Japanese occupation during WWII, now strongly supports a re-armed Japan as a counterweight to China.
但是，仅仅是态度强硬和严厉对话尚不足以回应，因为这一手段进一步羞辱那些已经感到受辱的人，并且让那些原本温和派离心离德。	However, high-handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response, for this approach further humiliates those who already feel humiliated, and alienates those who might otherwise proffer a more moderate voice.
并且许多抵押贷款持有人或许期望，在他们的利息达到月还款额的三倍或四倍之前，为他们的抵押贷款再次贷款。	And most mortgage holders probably expected to refinance their mortgages before their rising interest-rate trebled or quadrupled monthly repayments.
发自巴黎 — — 全球市场，政策制定者和风险管理者都在密切关注意大利政府与欧盟委员会之间的预算冲突。	PARIS – Global markets, policymakers, and risk managers are watching the budget skirmish between Italy’s government and the European Commission closely.
经济活动受信心的影响：消费者相信他们的收入可能上升（或者能够保住）吗？ 公司相信未来增长足够强劲，能保证当前投资的回报吗？	Economic activity is affected by confidence: Do consumers believe their incomes are likely to rise (or even prove secure), and do companies believe that future growth will be buoyant enough to warrant current investment?
但担忧利润的建筑业对这些规则进行了激烈批评，贷款申请被拒、因此不得不在规模很小的租房市场寻找适合房子的普通人也是如此。	But the construction industry, worried about its profits, has been harshly critical of the rules, as have ordinary people who have been denied credit, and thus must struggle to find suitable housing in a small rental market.
它的独特性 — — 中共的权威与其保持经济增长的能力相挂钩 — — 并不意味着它的幸灾乐祸是理性的。	But what makes it unique – the link between the CCP’s authority and its ability to sustain economic growth – does not make its gloating any more rational.
发自纽黑文 — — 在日益紧密关联的全球经济中，跨境贸易和金融-资本方面的联系变得比以往任何时候都更加重要。	NEW HAVEN – In an increasingly interconnected global economy, cross-border trade and financial-capital linkages have come to matter more than ever.
后一趋势的一个潜在驱动因素在于通过大幅扩大全球劳动力供给，中国和印度等多人口国家的全球一体化进程提高了资本对劳动力的议价能力。	One potential driver of the latter trend is that, by drastically enlarging the global labor supply, the economic integration of countries with large populations like China and India has increased the bargaining power of capital relative to labor.
尽管兜售官僚方案的西方专家强化了以服饰、语言和生活方式为基础的肤浅的现代感，很多穆斯林却在扩大经济机会和社会流动性方面看不到任何真正的好处。	While Western experts peddling bureaucratized solutions enforced superficial modernity, based on dress, language, and lifestyles, many Muslims saw no real benefit in the form of expanded economic opportunity and greater social mobility.
它既可以选择走上领导中东进入活力四射的多宗派民主政治之路，也可以后退陷入外部势力监护之下的腐朽地方政治之路。	It can choose to lead the Middle East into vibrant multi-sectarian democracy or slump back into corrupt local politics under foreign tutelage.
但目前，ISP由相互之间的价格战，也许不这么做，所以说用户应该对ISP提出这样的要求，ISP也应该有行业的规范，对那些没有安全设施的ISP作出限制。	But they won’t, because they compete mostly on price. So customers need to demand security as part of their service, while ISPs need to shun ISPs that don’t comply.
上个月，伊万罗杰斯爵士（Sir Ivan Rogers）被迫辞去英国驻欧盟永久代表一职，因为他质疑梅的谈判方针。 本周，他预测英国和欧洲之间将有一次“血腥、苦涩和扭曲的”分离。	Sir Ivan Rogers, who was forced to resign last month as the UK’s Permanent Representative to the EU because he questioned May’s negotiating approach, predicted this week a “gory, bitter, and twisted” breakup between Britain and Europe.
事实上自金融危机于2008年9月爆发以来，中国实现了比世界任何国家都更快的信贷增长，有历史记录以来的任何一场信贷热潮都难以与之匹敌。	Since the financial crisis erupted in September 2008, China has had the fastest credit growth of any country in the world. Indeed, it is hard to point to another credit boom of this magnitude in recorded history.
指责瓦鲁法基斯没有关起门来实施B计划也是不负责任的。 毕竟，希腊是否留在欧元区，决定权很大程度上掌握在其他人（特别是德国、欧洲央行和IMF）手中，现在仍是如此。	It also would have been irresponsible for Varoufakis not to work behind closed doors on a Plan B. After all, Greece’s eurozone destiny largely was – and remains – in the hands of others (particularly Germany, the ECB, and the IMF).
为了阻止巴尔干通道上的移民流，匈牙利开始在边界进行管制 — — 德国、奥地利、斯洛伐克、克罗地亚、斯洛文尼亚、捷克、荷兰和波兰也迅速跟进。	To staunch the flow of migrants over the Balkan route, Hungary has imposed controls on its borders – and was promptly followed by Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland.
冷战期间，开放的文化交流 — — 如让年轻人互相交流的萨尔茨堡研讨会（Salzburg Seminar ） — —证明了人口之间的联系要有意义得多。	During the Cold War, open cultural exchanges – such as the Salzburg Seminar, which enabled young people to engage with one another – demonstrated that contact among populations is far more meaningful.
虽然中国的GDP规模极为庞大且持续增长，其人均收入却一直偏低，奉行的经济政策也与亚太地区的经合组织国家大不相同。	Although Chinese GDP is large and growing, its per capita income is still low, and its economic policies differ sharply from those prevailing in the region’s OECD countries.
但是，没有密切的监督，主权财富基金免不了要面对东道国出于政治动机的限制，因此强化自我监督符合主权财富基金的利益。	But, without closer monitoring, SWFs will inevitably face politically motivated restrictions by some host countries, so it is in their interest to intensify their efforts at self-regulation.
在美国，国家医保（National Institutes of Health ，NIH）每年要花 370亿多美元用于生物医学研究，特别是在对私人部门来说风险过高的领域。	In the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) spends more than $37 billion on biomedical research every year, particularly in areas that are too risky for the private sector.
就像我们一位机构代表团代表所指出的那样 ， “ 他们似乎很感兴趣，但说不准什么时候就不感兴趣了 ” 。	As a member of our interagency delegation noted, “They seem to be interested in things until they are not.”
但因为土耳其迄今为止未能满足约定条件 — — 包括大规模修改其反恐立法 — — 欧盟不太可能兑现这一承诺，而且政变发生后似乎更不可能。	But, with Turkey having so far failed to meet the agreed conditions, including overhauling its anti-terrorism legislation, that may not happen – an outcome made even more likely by the coup attempt.
如果这个推测正确的话，那么阴谋的目标自然不是朱拜尔，而是政府内部致力于亲美外交的派系 — — 内贾德及其党羽。	If so, the plot’s target likely was not al-Jubeir himself, but rather those elements in the regime that seek a diplomatic opening to the US – namely, Ahmadinejad and his circle.
就在斯诺登泄密事件后，法国政府悄然通过了军事拨款法，大幅增加了政府因“商业”等原因实施网络监控的权利。	Immediately following the Snowden revelations, the French government snuck into a military appropriations bill the authority to increase government surveillance of the Internet dramatically, including for “commercial” reasons.
印度人仍然百思不得其解，为何美国国务院会有意地因为几十年来司空见惯的驻外外交官的行为而破坏被美国官员称为“战略性”的印美关系。	Indians remain bewildered that the US State Department would so willfully jeopardize a relationship that American officials had been describing as “strategic” over a practice routinely followed by foreign diplomats for decades.
比如，在澳大利亚，公投只能在特定的条件下举行，并且只有（在总体多数通过的基础上）多数州都经多数通过才算成功。	In Australia, for example, referenda can be used only under certain circumstances and can pass only with majority support in a majority of states (in addition to an overall majority).
发自莫桑比克首都马普托 — — 在过去十年的发展援助中所取得的其中一项重大成就莫过于对抗艾滋病，肺结核及疟疾的全球援助。	MAPUTO – One of the greatest successes in development aid in the past decade has been the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
自从国安局的互联网窃听被曝光以来，美国国外的政府和大公司便开始质疑美国IT企业保证其产品安全性的能力。	Since the scale of the NSA’s Internet eavesdropping came to light, governments and large companies outside of the United States are questioning the capacity of American IT firms to guarantee their products’ security.
每一个关注奥运会的印度人在浏览每日的奖牌名单时都心有悲戚，他们的眼睛在扫过了几十个大大小小的国家之后才最终落在了一个孤零零的印度获得的网球或摔跤铜奖上。	Every Indian who follows the Olympics has cringed scanning the daily list of medal winners, eyes traveling down past dozens of nations big and small before alighting on a solitary Indian bronze in tennis or wrestling.
有时这些杀手也会为自己的行为找一些意识形态上的理由：建立纯粹的伊斯兰国，为实现共产主义或者法西斯主义而奋斗，或者拯救西方。	And sometimes the killers reach for ideological justifications: building pure Islam, struggling for communism or fascism, or saving the West.
可卡因的流行是因为它的吸引力：白色，不是暗色；吸食，不用注射；能在起居室或时尚的夜店中消费，而不用屈身穷街陋巷。	Cocaine is fashionable because it is attractive: white, not dark; sniffed, not injected; consumed in a living room or a fashionable night-club, not in a dark alley.
这项黄金购买政策将官方黄金价格从1933年的20.67美元一盎司提高到1934年1月的35美元（实验随后终止了 ） 。	The gold-buying policy raised the official gold price from $20.67 an ounce in October 1933 to $35.00 an ounce in January 1934, when the experiment was discontinued.
我们必须这样做，这不仅是出于正义精神，也是因为，在一个受极端不公折磨的世界中，最贫困居民根本无从发出声音，即使他们拥有投票权。	We must do this not only out of a sense of justice, but also because, in a world afflicted with such extreme disparities, its poorest residents lose their voice, even when they have the right to vote.
拉丁美洲最老牌的游击队 — — 哥伦比亚革命武装力量（Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia）与大毒枭结成联盟。	The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – Latin America’s oldest guerilla group – formed alliances with narcotics cartels.
尽管这些价值不可能通过武力强加或如同速溶咖啡那样制造出来，如果各国能够更体面地对待自己的公民，世界将变得更和平、更稳定、更繁荣。	Though these values cannot be imposed by force or manufactured like instant coffee, the world is likely to be more peaceful, stable, and prosperous the more that countries treat their own citizens decently.
事实上，宪政委员会的评估是一种预先评估，时间就选择在法律通过后的一个月，而且只有总统、总理、国民议会和参议院主席等四名官员有权发起审阅。	Indeed, the Constitutional Council made its assessments a priori, one month after adoption of the law, and only four officials could initiate a review: the president, the prime minister, and the presidents of the National Assembly and the Senate.
为了维系和平条约，埃及和以色列应该重新协商军事附则，允许埃及在先前的限制区部署军队并重新获得西奈半岛的完全主权。	In order to sustain the peace treaty, Egypt and Israel should renegotiate its military annex to allow Egypt to deploy forces in previously restricted zones and re-establish full sovereignty over the Sinai.
在计划生育和妇科医疗方面（如在撒哈拉以南非洲和南亚地区提供紧急避孕服务）支出39亿美元，可以避免140万婴儿死亡和142000桩与妊娠相关的妇女死亡。	Spending $3.9 billion on family planning and maternal health initiatives, such as provision of emergency contraception in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, could avert 1.4 million infant deaths and 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths in women.
与他对不公平贸易赤字的猛烈抨击相反，中国对美国的真正挑战不在经济方面，而更多是在技术和军事优势方面的竞赛。	Contrary to his bluster over unfair trade deficits, China’s real challenge to the United States is less about economics and more about the race for technological and military supremacy.
而另一些学者则持有不同意见。 他们认为（人的）头脑可以通过将创痛的记忆从意识中消除的方式来保护自身，从而使受害者很难回忆起他们最为可怕的经历。	Others disagree, arguing that the mind can protect itself by banishing memories of trauma from awareness, making it difficult for victims to remember their most horrific experiences until it is safe to do so many years later.
第三也是最关键的，所有缔约各方，包括有核国家，同意进行核裁军 — — 事实上，还有一般裁军 — — 谈判。	Third, and crucially, all parties to the treaty, including the nuclear powers, agree to negotiate nuclear – and indeed general – disarmament.
2012年德国也被迫做出过妥协，默克尔同意了银行联盟和欧洲央行的“直接货币交易”计划，该计划在事实上将欧洲政府债券变成了欧元债券。	Germany was also forced to compromise in 2012, when Merkel was pushed into agreeing to a banking union and the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” program, which effectively turned European government bonds into Eurobonds.
尽管实验动物生活的环境通常在光线、温度和湿度等方面有良好的控制，但是在动物生活的设施内还是有许多未得到控制的噪音的来源，其中大部分来自人类的活动。	Although the environments of laboratory animals are usually well controlled in terms of lighting, temperature, and humidity, there are many uncontrolled sources of noise in animal facilities, most of which derive from human activities.
最后，G20应该授予金融稳定性委员会足够的制度地位以便让它完成自己的使命，同时又免于沦为一个官僚机构。	Finally, the G-20 should provide the FSB with adequate institutional capacity to address its tasks, but without creating a bureaucracy.
如果伯南克听后说 ： “ 这正是我们正在做的 ， ” 而不是寻找共识 — — 也就是说，如果伯南克的美联储和昔日的美联储一样 — — 2008年会做出更好的货币政策决策吗？	If Bernanke had then said, “This is what we are going to do,” rather than seeking consensus – that is, if Bernanke’s Fed had been like the old Fed – would better monetary-policy decisions have been made in 2008?
汉密尔顿和美国留给欧洲人的教训是，即使有了必要的制度，如果没有较大程度的一直道德观，这些制度也起不了作用。	The lesson to be learned from Hamilton and the US is that the necessary institutions will not function without a greater degree of moral consensus as well.
理论上，欧盟对于这个问题制定了明确的规则：根据所谓的都柏林规则，寻求庇护者所抵达的第一个欧盟国家负责审查他们的申请。	On paper, the EU has clear rules on the matter: under the so-called Dublin Regulation, the first EU country that asylum seekers enter is responsible for examining their applications.
创业企业Handy公司希望它的应用能取得类似的成功 — — Handy让客户联系独立承包商提供各种家政服务。	The startup Handy hopes that its app achieves similar success in connecting customers to independent contractors providing various household services.
我还询问了新近的购房者们是否同意美国（和其它许多发达国家）的房地产价格大幅上扬是因为人们担心失去工作这一理论。	I asked this question of recent homebuyers on the theory that fear of job loss might help explain the remarkable boom in home prices in the US (as well as many other advanced countries).
多数新闻消费者不了解这些报道的部分原因是像我所在机构这样的组织一直试图确保记者本身不成为新闻报道的主角。	Part of the reason most consumers of news do not know these stories is that organizations like mine have long worked to ensure that journalists never become the story.
北京会议提出的思想是R2P应该通过接受补充性的“责任保护 ” （ Responsible Protection）原则得到“强化 ” 。	The idea was that R2P should be “enriched” by the acceptance of a complementary principle, called “Responsible Protection.”
如今这个假设已基本崩溃，我们可能会面临贸易，投资，技术以及国家在经济中的作用方面不同行事手段之间的长期紧张态势。	Now that this assumption has largely collapsed, we are likely to face a prolonged period of tension over differing approaches to trade, investment, technology, and the role of the state in the economy.
如果这一模式意味着土耳其更加愿意接纳其传统和宗教遗产，其结果对于其大多数公民以及它的战略盟国来说将会相对良好。	If such a model means a Turkey that is more willing to embrace its traditional and religious heritage, the outcome would be relatively benign for most of its citizens as well as its strategic alliances.
施罗德在21世纪初重组德国劳动力市场的努力在当时引起了巨大的争议；但是，事后看来，施罗德的努力将德国从欧洲病夫变为欧洲大陆的出口冠军。	Schröder’s reshaping of Germany’s labor market in the early 2000s was hugely controversial at the time; but, in retrospect, it turned Germany from the sick man of Europe into the continent’s export powerhouse.
初具雏形的“世界公民社会”的出现，提升了人们对世界性和富有魅力的领袖人物的需求。 这样的人物不仅满足人们对全球性责任的希望，还带有浓厚的平民色彩。	The emergence of an embryonic “world civil society” heightens demand for universal and charismatic figures, holding out the hope of global accountability, but also carrying populist overtones.
麦肯锡的最新研究表明，因收入导致的教育机会和程度差距造成美国经济永久性地衰退了GDP的3—5 % 。	And a recent study by McKinsey suggests that the gaps in educational opportunity and attainment by income impose the equivalent of a permanent recession of 3-5% of GDP on the US economy.
对吉西他滨化疗产生抗药性的肺癌细胞比对药物治疗敏感的其他肿瘤细胞的扩散性、侵略性和能动性都有所下降。	Lung cancer cells that are resistant to the chemotherapy gemcitabine are less proliferative, invasive, and motile than their drug-sensitive counterparts.
我并不是心怀怨恨；我只是想别让其他乘客也有这么差的体验，我也希望这样的反馈能鼓励他改善工作或换个工作。	I was not being vindictive; I wanted to save other passengers from an unpleasant experience, and I hoped that maybe feedback would encourage him to improve or find another line of work.
接下来美国又退出伊核协议，这再次为特朗普提供了绝佳机会尽情享受欧洲，特别是德国总理安格拉·默克尔的无能和软弱。	Next came the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which offered Trump yet another splendid opportunity to luxuriate in Europe’s powerlessness, and especially that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
随着冷战（及随后的美国主宰时期）所确定的全球秩序正在成为历史，必须发展出新的机构和协定保护全球体系的核心稳定。	As the global order defined by the Cold War (and then by a briefly dominant America) recedes into history, a new set of institutions and agreements must be developed to protect the core stability of the system.
从巴基斯坦的角度来看，过去这段关系则更多是充满着背叛，美国一时会与巴基斯坦打得火热，可一但其领导人改变了想法，又会随时切断援助。	From the Pakistani perspective, the past would be mostly a narrative of multiple betrayals, featuring a US that gets close to Pakistan for a time, only to cut off aid whenever its leaders see fit.
比如，二十世纪初，在北海一条成熟的鳕鱼一般不短于五十厘米，而到了八十年代，一条成熟的鳕鱼就只有十五厘米那么长了。	For example, early in the twentieth century, you would not find a mature cod in the North Sea less than about 50 centimeters in length, whereas by the 1980's mature cod were as small as 15 centimeters.
印度的民主和急速发展的经济使其成为亚洲力量平衡格局的一个重要因素，而不久前对孟买的恐怖袭击则让人们再次注意到反抗伊斯兰暴力极端主义的共同的斗争。	India’s democracy and burgeoning economy make it a major factor in the Asian balance of power, and the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai underscore a shared struggle against violent Islamic extremism.
因此我们必须确保研发工作列入5月日本七国集团峰会的讨论议程，重点关注那些既能挽救生命又能大幅改善最贫困群体经济前景产品的研究和部署。	That is why we must ensure that R&D is on the agenda at the G7 summit in Japan in May, with a focus on developing and deploying products that both save lives and dramatically improve the economic prospects of the poorest.
15年前，很少有人能够预测像谷歌或领书这样的大型平台将成为图像识别、人工智能和自动驾驶汽车（包括军用汽车）研发领域的关键参与者。	Fifteen years ago, few would have predicted that mega-platforms like Google or Facebook would become key players in areas like image recognition, artificial intelligence, and the development of autonomous vehicles (including military vehicles).
在某些显然不太有文化的校园常见的可怕行话（所谓的“无平台化 ” ） 里，某些人说话的机会被彻底剥夺。	Some people are being denied the chance to speak as well – so-called “no platforming”, in the awful jargon of some clearly not very literate campuses.
与此相比，控制进程就可能重新塑造全球化，从而全球化最终可以实现其潜力及其前景，那就是全世界所有人更高的生活水准。	By contrast, taking control of the process holds out the possibility of remaking globalization, so that it at last lives up to its potential and its promise: higher living standards for everyone in the world.
欧洲和美国的社会各界 — — 公司、非政府组织或国际专家委员会 — — 比从前更积极地加入其中是至关重要的。	It is all the more important that societal stakeholders – companies, NGOs, or international commissions of experts – both here and in the US become more heavily involved than before.
目前，存储问题导致近20%的印度新鲜农产品遭到浪费，因此大多数个体农户不会冒险种植易腐作物，而这些作物所带来的收入往往比种植主食要多得多。	Currently, nearly 20% of India’s fresh produce is wasted because of storage problems, so most small farmers do not risk growing perishable crops that would yield more revenue than staples.
从2004年到2013年，中国人民银行购入了数万亿美元的外汇储备，从而防止人民币升值幅度大于自由浮动的情形。	From 2004 to 2013, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) bought trillions of dollars in foreign-exchange reserves, thereby preventing the renminbi from appreciating as much as it would have had it floated freely.
他们似乎都已经适应了增长放缓 — — 尽管一开始有些惊讶，因为官员此前指出中国需要高速增长维持就业、避免政治动荡。	They all seemed reconciled to slower growth, which was initially surprising, because officials previously argued that China needed rapid growth to maintain employment and avoid political unrest.
沙特阿拉伯新王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（MBS）也在力推沙特-以色列恢复邦交，他在追求内政和外交的现代化。	The Saudi-Israeli rapprochement has been helped along by Saudi Arabia’s new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), who is pursuing a program of modernization, both domestically and in foreign-policy terms.
事实上， 研究表明如果所有育龄妇女都能接受中学教育，那么五岁以前死亡的儿童人数每年将下降约350,000人。	In fact, research shows that if all childbearing-age women were to complete secondary education, the number of children dying before age five would drop by about 350,000 each year.
在其他国家（如希腊以及西班牙和意大利的部分地区 ） ， 政府领导的招工潮为教育程度不高者提供了就业保障。	In other countries, like Greece, as well as under regional administrations in Italy and Spain, a government-led hiring spree created secure jobs for the moderately educated.
事实上，和大部分发展中国家一样，中国仍然是“不成熟的债权人 ” ， 主要用美元贷款；而如果它需要从国际市场上借钱，大部分债务也必须用美元而不是人民币发行。	Indeed, like most developing countries, China remains an “immature creditor” that lends mainly in dollars; and if it needed to borrow in international markets, it would have to issue most of its debt in dollars, not renminbi.
比尔·盖茨和埃伦·巴菲特名列美国富豪第一和第二，可能也是全球富豪前两名。 他们时常被人说成是卡内基著名的1889年“财富的福音”一文的崇拜者。	Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, the richest and second richest person in America, and perhaps the world, are often described as admirers of Andrew Carnegie’s famous 1889 essay “The Gospel of Wealth.”
它将针对仍然能从贸易中获得极大收益的领域，例如国际劳动者流动性，而不是那些只会让特殊利益者受益的领域。	And it would target areas where the gains from trade are still very large, such as international worker mobility, instead of areas that benefit only special interests.
2013年，四家碳排大户 — — 雪佛龙、埃克森美孚、英国石油和壳牌 — — 利润总额达到了940亿美元。	In 2013, the combined profits of just four majors – Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP, and Shell – topped $94 billion.
中国还动用了“法律武器 ” ， 有选择性地援引殖民地时代的协定，而忽视其自身违反时间上更近的双边协定的行为 — — 不丹和印度都指出过。	China has also employed “lawfare,” selectively invoking a colonial-era accord, while ignoring its own violations – cited by Bhutan and India – of more recent bilateral agreements.
如果他们希望获得难民地位 — — 更不要说食物、衣物、住所和其他基本的生活必需品 — — 他们就必须提供非政府组织、政府间机构、援助机构和人道主义工作人员所要求提供的任何信息。	If they hope to be granted refugee status – not to mention food, clothing, shelter, and other basic necessities – they have to give whatever information the NGOs, IGOs, aid agencies, and humanitarian workers request.
这些数据似乎与埃及最近的议会选举结果矛盾，在这次议会选举中，穆斯林兄弟会和萨里发原教旨主义者共获得了约65%的大众选票。	These figures seem at odds with the results of Egypt’s recent parliamentary election, in which the Muslim Brothers and the Salafi fundamentalists together gained about 65% of the popular vote.
世界经济现在拥有能发挥作用的国际机构 — — 如国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界贸易组织（WTO ） — —这些机构在二战之前都尚未建立。	The world economy now has functional international institutions – such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization (WTO) – that it lacked prior to the Second World War.
这一方法称为“可持续集约化 ” ， 其目的是用整合作物管理和先进虫害控制等技术，提高现有耕地的产出。	This approach, known as “sustainable intensification,” aims to boost the output of existing farmland using techniques such as integrated crop management and advanced pest control.
而中共处理这些问题的能力未必如人们所认为的那样坚挺，最近其处理股市波动的拙劣管理表现清楚地表明了这一点。	And the Party’s ability to address them cannot be taken for granted, as its muddled management of recent stock-market volatility made clear.
有时候她的努力是很拙劣的，例如她将拥抱艾滋病受害者作为社会包容的隐喻；有时候她的努力是事与愿违的，例如她为人所知的和仆人的亲密关系，在其死后为泛滥成灾的揭秘书籍提供了素材。	Sometimes her efforts were heavy-handed, as when she embraced AIDS victims physically as a metaphor for social inclusion; sometimes they backfired, as when her shared intimacies with servants provided fodder for a flood of posthumous tell-all books.
《原子科学家文摘 》 （ Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist）上刊登了六篇系列文章《德国的退核 》 （ The German Nuclear Exit ） ， 文章认为告别核能已经“产生了可观的经济和环境好处 。 ”	A six-article series, “The German Nuclear Exit,” in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist argues that the move away from nuclear energy is already “yielding measurable economic and environmental benefits.”
而且毋庸置疑，由于冲突的直接影响以及迫使阿萨德同意政治解决（尽管这种努力最终失败）而实施的制裁，叙利亚的经济已经遭到了彻底破坏。	And, needless to say, the country’s economy has been shattered, owing to the direct effects of the conflict and to sanctions that were imposed as part of the failed effort to force Assad into a political settlement.
梅算不上顽固强硬的铁娘子，她开始了新一轮努力，要从欧洲领导人口中榨取更多的让步，让她的分手协议更能够被她的政党乃至大部分老百姓所接受。	Not so much an iron lady as a stubborn and dogged one, May has begun another round of effort to extract a few further concessions from European leaders to make her divorce agreement more palatable to her party, if not a majority of the public.
事实上，在贫困线较低、现有社会安全网管理起来事倍功半的地方，基本收入在财政上很有可能是可行的 — — 从社会角度更是令人向往。	In fact, a basic income may very well be fiscally feasible – not to mention socially desirable – in places where the poverty threshold is low and existing social safety nets are both threadbare and expensive to administer.
其次，该地区的各国政府 — — 叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、土耳其、伊朗、伊拉克、埃及等 — — 有动力也有办法达成互相妥协。	Second, the region’s governments – in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and elsewhere – have both the incentive and the means to reach mutual accommodations.
2015年，英国立法者批准了一种叫做“线粒体捐赠”的种系转基因 — — 通常也称为“三亲”体外受精（IVF ） 。	In 2015, British lawmakers approved a form of germline modification known as “mitochondrial donation” – commonly referred to as “three-parent” in vitro fertilization (IVF).
诚然，最近人民币兑美元有所贬值，但贬值幅度不及日元、欧元和英镑 — — 并且这些贬值也不是因为对美国经济信心相对较强而导致的。	Yes, the Chinese renminbi has declined recently against the dollar, but not as much as the Japanese yen, the euro, or the British pound – and those declines have been driven by relative confidence in the US economy.
国内政策调整为里拉提供了短期喘息，但可能既不全面，也不充分，无法让土耳其回归包容经济增长和持续金融稳定的希望之路。	While the domestic policy adjustments provide short-term relief for the currency, they may be neither comprehensive nor sufficient as yet to return Turkey to a promising path for inclusive economic growth and durable financial stability.
纽约—美国上诉法院的最新决定可能会让全球主权债务市场天翻地覆，甚至会导致美国不再被视为发行主权债务的理想之地。	NEW YORK – A recent decision by a United States appeals court threatens to upend global sovereign-debt markets. It may even lead to the US no longer being viewed as a good place to issue sovereign debt.
发达国家不再只是进步的促成者，而是将国内GDP的一定百分比专用于支持发展中国家消除贫困、改善健康状况和提高生活水平的目标。	Developed countries are no longer just enablers of progress, earmarking a percentage of their GDP to support the efforts of developing countries to reduce poverty, improve health, and raise living standards.
这与中国的“重大空间”战略概念相吻合，这一空间包括陆地、海上、空中以及太空的国家战略活动的所有方面。	This is consistent with the Chinese strategic concept of “vital space,” which includes all spheres of a state’s strategic activities, on land, at sea, under water, in the air, and in space.
如果响应能力缺乏或不足，则可能导致可怕的生命和生活损失 — — 2005年摧毁海地和新奥尔良的卡特里娜飓风就是明证。	When it is absent or deficient, the loss of life and livelihoods can be horrific – witness Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged Haiti and New Orleans in 2005.
1998年，法国总统雅克·希拉克和英国首相托尼·布莱尔共同发表了《圣马洛宣言 》 ， 表达了两国增强欧盟安全和防卫能力的决心。	In 1998, the Saint Malo Declaration by French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair indicated both countries’ determination to reinforce the EU’s security and defense capabilities.
而且，尤其鉴于英国对其自身决策后果令人惊叹的毫无准备 — — 英国的战略、优先事项甚至脱欧时间表都依然无法确定 — — 这意味着欧盟必须开始思考如何争取最好的结果。	And, especially given Britain’s stunning unpreparedness for the consequences of its own decision – its strategy, priorities, and even its timetable remain uncertain – that means that the EU must start figuring out how to make the best of it.
很多国家都有过类似的经历，因为发现自然资源而喜出望外，最终却落得失望的下场，天赐良机白白浪费，国民的生活质量却没有大的改善。	Many countries have been in this position before, exhilarated by natural-resource bonanzas, only to see the boom end in disappointment and the opportunity squandered, with little payoff in terms of a better quality of life for their people.
如此掣肘恰恰暴露了前南国际法庭的根本弱点：与纽伦堡法庭不同，国际社会是在战争中，而不是在战后，召集了前南国际法庭。	Such foot-dragging exposes the ICTY’s fundamental weakness: unlike the Nuremberg tribunal, the international community convened it during, not after, a war.
而就连这个数字都可能不保：由于无法筹集到维持每月运营所需的3万欧元（折合3.49万美元 ） ， 联合国儿童基金会管理的最大型非正式教育中心将于12月关闭。	And that number may be set to fall: the largest informal education center, run by UNICEF, is set to close in December, because the €30,000 ($34,900) per month needed to operate it cannot be found.
自然，同样的事情也发生在一群年轻人身上，他们决定通过劫持民航客机撞向纽约和华盛顿的公共建筑来自杀和屠杀别人。	The same is true, naturally, of a group of young men who decide to commit suicide and mass murder by flying commercial airliners into large public buildings in New York and Washington.
比如，他们现在所攻讦的个人强制保险，原本就是由保守派智库提出的，目的是要设计一个政府在其中的作用最小化的可行的全国医保体系。	For example, the individual mandate that they now decry was originally developed by conservative think tanks seeking to devise a workable system of national health insurance with the smallest possible role for the government.
对于公共机构来说，调整的过程更加艰巨，特别是考虑到它们还要充当各种看门人、促进因素和监管部门的角色。	The adjustment process is even trickier for public institutions, especially given their wide-ranging roles as gatekeepers, enablers, and regulators.
在中国方面，这包括“一带一路”计划及其结构性改革计划。 一带一路着重于战略性投资，结构性改革着重于让经济进一步市场化以及鼓励创新。	On China’s side, these include the “one belt, one road” initiative, which focuses on strategic investment, and its structural reform plans, which focus on making the economy more market-oriented and bolstering innovation.
纽约 — — 大多数观察者认为，非传统货币政策，如量化宽松（QE ） ， 是让当前乏力的经济重新启动的必要手段。	NEW YORK – Most observers regard unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing (QE) as necessary to jump-start growth in today’s anemic economies.
这就是为什么一些人建议中国采取一次性大幅升值的策略 — — 一次升足，打消人民币进一步走强的预期，阻止投机性“热钱”的涌入。	That is why some people are advocating that China undertake a one-shot, big-bang appreciation – large enough to defuse expectations of further strengthening and deter inflows of speculative “hot” money.
Wolfensohn发起的抵制腐败运动也代表了思想的一个重大转变，从 减小 国家 规模 转而 改善 国家。	Wolfensohn’s campaign against corruption also represented a major change in thinking, a shift from downsizing the state to improving the State.
其中最著名的包括在2007~2017年间任厄瓜多尔总统拉斐尔·科雷亚（Rafael Correa ） ； 委内瑞拉的乌戈·查韦斯及其继任者尼古拉斯·马杜罗日益残酷的政权；以及玻利维亚现任总统埃沃·莫拉莱斯（Evo Morales）的政府。	These include, most notably, Rafael Correa’s 2007-2017 presidency in Ecuador; the increasingly brutal regime of Hugo Chávez and his successor, Nicolás Maduro, in Venezuela; and the administration of President Evo Morales in Bolivia.
朝鲜在亚洲已陷入越来越孤立的状态，如果其内部冲突变得更加尖锐，那么中国可能会发现很难再自持金正恩，只能漠然地看着他自生自灭。	Given its increasingly isolated international position in Asia, if North Korea’s internal conflicts become acute, China may find it difficult to behave toward Kim Jong-un with anything but cold and anxiety-ridden indifference.
虽然《稳定和增长公约》可能有足够的弹性来允许一些成员国的赤字刺激方案，但是，有些国家仍然可能会觉得不能像自己想的那样采取激进的措施。	Although the Stability and Growth Pact may be elastic enough to permit some deficit stimulus, a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressively as it wants.
只有少数职业经济学家预见到危机的来临 — — 而危机的余波至今仍在震荡 — — 这让许多人质疑经济学界是否给社会做出了重大贡献。	The failure of all but a few professional economists to forecast the episode – the aftereffects of which still linger – has led many to question whether the economics profession contributes anything significant to society.
尽管我们在改善女童教育和健康状况方面取得了令人瞩目的成本就，但亚太地区妇女仍然面临传统偏 — — 持家才是她们的主要角色。	While there have been notable advances in girls’ education and health, women across the region remain subject to traditional attitudes that define their primary role as being in the home.
通过向提供低收入户免费银行借记账户 — — 也可以用来接收政府的转移支付，该方案得以在金融上存在一定的包容性。	The plan provides for financial inclusion by offering low-income households free debit accounts, which could also be used to make government transfer payments.
2013年所实施的宪法改革以及其他政策扩大了行政机关的权力，并成立了一个由青年民主党党员把持的新的国家委员会来监管媒体。	The constitutional reforms implemented in 2013, among other things, expanded the executive’s authority and created a new state council, stacked with Fidesz members, to regulate the media.
普纳（Pune）的一位年轻的穆斯林技术工人更惨，他因为完全与他无关的冒犯性社交媒体言论而惨遭“报复 ” ， 被殴致死。	A more tragic fate befell a young Muslim tech worker in Pune, who was beaten to death in “retaliation” for a defamatory social-media post with which he had no connection.
随着中国不断强化其网络战能力并投资于重要的电信基础设施，美国政府最近认为有必要禁止美国公司向中国电信巨头中兴通讯销售组件。	With China expanding its cyberwarfare capabilities and investing in vital telecom infrastructure, the US government recently saw fit to bar US firms from selling components to the Chinese telecom giant ZTE.
于是只剩下了外部需求，而这也许代表了安倍经济学中最严重的战略缺陷：它没有考虑某些全球经济中有可能发生的最大变化。	That leaves external demand, which underscores what is perhaps Abenomics’ most serious strategic flaw: It does not take into consideration some of the biggest changes that are likely to occur in the global economy.
今天，世界十个增长最快的经济体有六个在非洲，今年非洲GDP 增长预计将达4.1 % ， 而2017年为3.6 % 。	Six of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies are now located in the region, and the continent’s GDP is expected to grow at a rate of 4.1% this year, up from 3.6% in 2017.
单凭市场的力量无法解决例如温室气体排放等的客观事实，在政府垄断着当前包括石油等的能源前提下，大量贫困人口依然无法享用基本的能源。	And market forces alone are unable to cope with major externalities such as greenhouse-gas emissions, with overwhelming government control over major energy sources such as oil, and with huge numbers of people too poor to constitute a market.
许多拒绝接受蒙难难民的国家后来纷纷被纳粹占领和蹂躏 — — 急切地需要它们在1938年拒绝了犹太人的同情心。	Many of the countries that refused to take in suffering refugees were themselves, in due course, occupied and brutalized by the Nazis – and desperate for the compassion that they denied the Jews in July 1938.
这有些奇怪，因为阅读另一部出色的新书、安格斯·迪顿（Angus Deaton）的《大脱贫 》 （ The Great Escape，我最近为它写了书评）会让你觉得世界比从前任何时候都更加平等。	That is odd, because one might conclude from reading another excellent new book, Angus Deaton’s The Great Escape (which I recently reviewed), that the world is more equal than ever.
结果，美国及其盟友 — — 包括我的祖国澳大利亚，当时我也在澳大利亚政府任职 — — 当时及此后都没有兴趣详细追查苏哈托的新秩序是如何巩固权力的。	As a result, there was no appetite among the US and its allies – including my own country, and the Australian government of which I was a member – to look closely, then or since, at how Suharto’s New Order consolidated its power.
作为困难时期新兴市场的一个亮点，印度的确是世界上增长最快的主要经济体，因此它是举办此次会议的一个吉祥场所。	India, a bright spot among emerging markets in these difficult times – indeed, the world’s fastest growing major economy – is an auspicious place to hold this gathering.
纽约—印度最高法院拒绝支持瑞士制药巨头诺华公司著名抗癌药物格列卫（Gleevec）专利的决定对广大印度癌症患者来说不啻福音。	NEW YORK – The Indian Supreme Court’s refusal to uphold the patent on Gleevec, the blockbuster cancer drug developed by the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, is good news for many of those in India suffering from cancer.
比如，南欧国家的增长潜力或许在于放松服务部门的监管、减少就业保护以为丢掉工作的政府员工和失业青年创造更多的私人部门工作岗位。	For example, Southern Europe’s growth potential may consist in deregulating service sectors and reducing employment protection to spur creation of more private-sector jobs for retrenched government workers and unemployed youth.
通过制定一个在适当的时候确定汇率的强制性方法，并向公众公布，金融市场将能够更加准确地预测将来的参考汇率。	By developing and disclose to the public a compelling rationale for what will determine the exchange rate when the time comes, the financial markets would then be able to forecast the future reference exchange rate more precisely.
改革授权宪政委员会重新审议一系列从未进行过合宪性审议的法律，主要原因是这些法律都是1958年之前通过的。	The reform has allowed the Constitutional Council to reconsider a whole set of laws that had never before been submitted for constitutional review, mainly because they were drafted prior to 1958.
事实上，公决甚至可能已经促使欧盟国家 — — 包括丹麦和瑞典等国吵吵闹闹的欧洲怀疑主义政党 — — 为支持欧盟资格而相互团结。	In fact, the referendum may have even prompted EU countries – including those with noisy Euroskeptic parties, such as Denmark and Sweden – to close ranks in support of EU membership.
它们受益于“后发优势 ” ： 技术创新与产业升级可以通过模仿，进口来实现，以及/或者与现有的技术和产业整合，而所有这一切都意味着更低的研发费用。	As a result, they benefit from the “latecomer’s advantage”: technological innovation and industrial upgrading can be achieved by imitation, import, and/or integration of existing technologies and industries, all of which implies much lower R&D costs.
而这种观点也得到了最近的科学研究的支持，研究显示我们的大部分行为都是基于非常快速，直觉和感性的反应。	That view is supported by recent scientific work showing that much of our behavior is based on very rapid, instinctive, emotionally based responses.
在1966年，你站在华盛顿的一间政府办公室里，看到一位身着制服的官员对一位商务打扮的人说 ： “ 你的任务是消灭一个敌人，这个敌人杀掉的人比两次世界大战加起来还要多。	You are standing in a government office in Washington, DC, watching a uniformed official tell a man in business attire, “Your mission is to eradicate an enemy that has killed more people than both world wars combined.
几周前，人们还在担心濒临崩溃的叙利亚政权可能会把大规模杀伤性武库部分转移给真主党，其中一部分可能落到圣战组织手中。	Just a few weeks ago, it was feared that Syria’s crumbling regime might transfer part of its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to Hezbollah, or that some of that arsenal might fall into jihadis’ hands.
"通过对美国的种族隔离政策违反了""平等的法律保护""的宪法条款的裁决，高院的正义一击对美国国内和其在海外的战略利益产生了重要影响。"	"By holding that American apartheid violated the constitutional command of ""equal protection of the laws,"" the court struck a blow for justice at home and American strategic interests abroad."
如今，针对化石燃料行业的股东积极主义大多集中在，随着世界日益摆脱化石燃料，企业的碳氢化合物储量最终将失去经济性。	Nowadays, much of the shareholder activism against the industry focuses on the extent to which firms’ hydrocarbon reserves ultimately may prove commercially nonviable as the world shifts away from fossil fuels.
研究表明，极少有成功的企业是从非正式小企业起步的；相反，它们开创时便已大多具有相当大的规模，由企业家凭借他的技能和市场知识在经济较先进的部分创办。	Studies show that few successful businesses begin as small, informal firms; they are started, instead, at a fairly large scale, by entrepreneurs who pick up their skills and market knowledge in the more advanced parts of the economy.
与此同时，其他地方的央行则要扪心自问：为什么要囤积世界上两大治理最不力的货币 — — 美元和欧元 — — 作为国际储备？	Meanwhile, central bankers everywhere ask themselves: why keep ever-larger international reserves in two of the world’s most mismanaged currencies, the US dollar and the euro?
英国退出投票表明，欧洲政治阶级极大地低估了跨境自由流动所造成的张力 — — 这是最大化市场资源配置这一失败的新自由主义计划的陈词滥调。	As the Brexit vote shows, Europe’s political class greatly underestimated the strains caused by free mobility across borders – a shibboleth of the failed neoliberal project of maximizing market-based resource allocation.
对于每个主要问题，诸如饥荒、文盲、营养不良、疟疾、艾滋病、干旱等等，也有相应能够承受且已被证明可操作的解决方法。	For every major problem - hunger, illiteracy, malnutrition, malaria, AIDS, drought, and so forth - there are practical solutions that are proven and affordable.
类似地，美国谘商会（Conference Board）消费者信心指数也在2月份达到了15年来的高点。	Likewise, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index hit a 15-year high in February.
另外，与这样一个公然极端的伊朗（甚至以强硬派政权的标准来看也甚为激进）打交道，不仅对美国，对欧洲也同样是一个挑战。	Moreover, dealing with such an openly extreme Iran – radical even by the hardline regime’s standards – will be a challenge not just for the US, but for Europe as well.
事实上，危机正在侵蚀欧洲一体化的基石 — — 法德合作伙伴关系和跨大西洋合作伙伴关系。 二战以来，这一秩序保证了欧洲大陆没有重蹈历史覆辙，实现了长时间的和平与繁荣。	Indeed, the crisis is beginning to erode the very foundations – the Franco-German and transatlantic partnerships – of a post-war European order that has ensured a period of peace and prosperity without precedent in the history of the continent.
挪威现在树立了一个良好的范例。 这是超越在许多公司和机构中依然盛行的性别偏见和成见文化的最佳做法，欧洲应该予以效仿。	Norway has set an excellent example – one that all of Europe should follow as the best way to transcend the culture of gender bias and stereotyping that is still prevalent in many companies and institutions.
这出戏中的恶棍就是弗拉季米尔·普京。 他在前任叶利钦实施的市场改革所带来的经济快速成长之上风光了8年。	The villain in this drama is Vladimir Putin, who has thrived on eight years of rapid growth generated by the market reforms of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
具体到叙利亚问题，西方国家曾多次在排除军事行动可能性的前提下呼吁外交解决，这样做显然不会取得太好的结果。	In the case of Syria, the West has repeatedly called for diplomacy while ruling out any military action, with predictably bad results.
事实上，美国已经在这方面有所行动了：这是一个被称为“短时补偿 ” （ Short-Time Compensation）的项目。	In fact, the US already has something along these lines: a program known as Short-Time Compensation.
通过证明只有约半数燃烧化石燃料产生的二氧化碳残留在空气中，该委员会证明了地球并非温室气体的来源，而只是作为吸收器，吸收了人类半数的二氧化碳排放。	By showing that only about half of the CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels remains in the atmosphere, the committee proved that the earth acts not as a source of greenhouse gases, but as a sink, soaking up half of our emissions.
但我们的远见终将开启北朝鲜问题的解决方式。 这不仅能为北朝鲜带去更好的未来，还能令朝鲜半岛成为东北亚和平与繁荣的门户。	But our vision will eventually open up ways to solve North Korea’s problems, not only bringing a better future for the North, but also making the Korean Peninsula a gateway for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia.
他说，印度刑法主要是“英国人为了殖民需要而制定 ” ， 必须进行修订以反映我们的“当代社会良知 ” 。	India’s criminal law, he declared, was largely “enacted by the British to meet their colonial needs,” and must be revised to reflect our “contemporary social consciousness.”
按照国际社会为了和平稳定所做的努力，草案还在每个军事部署内创建了一个核心单位，并建立了一套统一的行动制度。	In conformity with the international community’s efforts to secure peace and stability, the draft also creates a core unit within each of the military branches, and establishes an integrated operational system.
虽然不同国家的改革计划差异显著，但它们同样涉及到五大重点领域，这五大领域相互结合就构成了旨在巩固地区转型的焦点政策领域。	That agenda, with obvious country differences, spans five important areas, which together should be the focus of policy attention aimed at solidifying the region’s transformation.
ITER合作国 — — 中国、欧盟、印度、日本、俄罗斯、韩国和美国 — — 占据了全世界将近一半的人口总数。	The ITER partners – China, the European Union, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States – represent half the world’s population.
她直言不讳 ： “ 比较可能起到误导作用；不管波斯尼亚的情况多么可怕，把它与不可比较的犹太人的苦难相比，都不会让任何人感到舒服 。 ”	She did not mince words: “Comparisons can be misleading; however awful the Bosnian situation may be, you do no one any favors by identifying it with the incomparable suffering of the Jews.”
可是怀旧情绪使得这两个国家错误地估计了目前所面临的挑战，无论是把基地组织与萨达姆·侯赛因的伊拉克连在一起，还是把真主党与伊朗和叙利亚扯到一块都是这种错误的典型表现。	But nostalgia has led both states to misinterpret the challenges they now face, whether by linking al-Qaeda to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, or Hezbollah to Iran and Syria.
此外，不仅仅是郑筱萸一个人被处决了，药品注册司原司长曹文庄因为从药品生产厂家那儿收受了大约30万美元的贿赂也被判处了死刑。	Moreover, not only was Zhen Xiaouyu executed, but Cao Wenzhuang, who was in charge of drug registration at the SFDA, was sentenced to death for accepting roughly $300,000 in bribes from drug manufacturers.
例如，在有限资产公司的案例中，破产受益人只获得了很不合理的少量补偿。 而且，随意地，不加选择地任命破产案产业管理人造成了有时组织臃肿，有时又人手不足的困境。	For example, receivers are paid unreasonably poorly in cases of limited assets; furthermore, the random, indiscriminate appointment of receivers sometimes leaves cases over- or understaffed.
在本周末的慕尼黑，当代和未来施密特们和基辛格们将有机会参与可能是现时代最重要的战略讨论：如何防止西方在数字时代落于人后。	This weekend in Munich, the Schmidts and Kissingers of today and tomorrow will have an opportunity to engage in what is probably the most important strategic debate of our time: how to prevent the West from falling apart inthe digital age.
相反，各国的不平等率是相对的 — — 这是一个狭隘的方法，忽略了从总体经济趋势到不同社会环境中财富不平等性对人口的影响的不同的各种因素。	Instead, countries’ rates of inequality are measured against one another – a narrow approach that ignores everything from broader economic trends to differences in the impact of wealth inequality on populations in different social environments.
这或许是因为专家和知识密集型组织的专业人士更愿意由在本领域取得过出类拔萃成绩的老板来领导自己的工作。	This might be because experts and professionals in knowledge-intensive organizations prefer a boss who has excelled in their field.
其中之一在关于皮克提的书的争论中鲜有提及，即巨富之间的联姻倾向 — — 随着更多女性加入高收入行列，这一现象正变得日益普遍。	One that has been largely neglected in the debate about Piketty’s book is the tendency of the superrich to marry one another – an increasingly common phenomenon as more women join the group of high earners.
没有什么伊斯兰军队会入侵欧洲。 实际上，大多数革命伊斯兰主义的受害者居住在中东，而非欧洲，而内贾德尽管其言辞可恶但是其实力不可与希特勒相提并论。	No Islamist armies are about to march into Europe – indeed, most victims of Revolutionary Islamism live in the Middle East, not in Europe – and Ahmadinejad, his nasty rhetoric notwithstanding, does not have a fraction of Hitler’s power.
实际上早在十年前，查戈斯人就已经取得了一场重大司法胜利，英国最高法院裁定当年对岛民的驱逐不合法，而且应该允许岛民回归。	Ten years ago, the Chagossians won a tremendous victory in the British High Court, which ruled that the islanders’ expulsion had been unlawful, and that they should be allowed to return.
这意味着通过采取更高管理标准 — — 比如要求公司投资组合包含一定的可持续性目标 — — 鼓励负责任的投资。	That means encouraging responsible investing by adopting ever higher standards of stewardship – for example, by requiring companies' portfolios to meet certain sustainability targets.
即使是现在，土耳其对欧洲的一厢情愿仍旧可能转变为厌恶，到时，伊斯兰原教旨主义和大土耳其民族主义将继续代表其他向东方倾斜的选择。	Even now, Turkey’s unrequited love for Europe can still fade into aversion, with Islamic fundamentalism and Greater Turkey nationalism continuing to represent other, eastward-leaning options.
在疟疾肆虐的国家，灭蚊计划可以提高产量，甚至还可以提高土地有效使用率，使那些不适于人居住的耕地变得可居住。	In a malaria-infested country, mosquito eradication programs can boost production and even increase effective land usage, as acres that were almost uninhabitable become livable.
但这也解释了为什么突尼斯的一次自焚事件能够点燃阿拉伯之春，而三十多名西藏喇嘛的自焚没能在西藏点燃类似的群众运动。	But it may also explain why one self-immolation in Tunisia helped to kindle the Arab Spring, whereas some three dozen self-immolations by Tibetan monks and nuns have failed to ignite a similar popular movement against the Chinese state.
而在波兰首都，天主教和保守派政党，再加上名为“团结”的贸易联盟，在保守基督教“玛利亚电台”的鼓动下，出于政治和文化 — — 而非经济 — — 的原因走上街头。	In the Polish capital, Catholic and conservative parties, together with the “Solidarity” Trade Union, inspired by a reactionary Christian radio network, “Radio Maria,” gathered for political and cultural, rather than economic, reasons.
这些加密货币并没有表现出比常规货币更高效的支付手段和价值储藏功能，反倒刺激资源从生产性用途中分散 。	Far from being more efficient as a means of payment or store of value than conventional money, cryptocurrencies seem to encourage the diversion of resources away from productive uses.
结果，身体上的暴力以及言语上的挑衅文化在普京统治下的俄国扎根，非常令人担忧，而我们却对中国的不良行为即使不是无动于衷，也是怀有更大的距离感。	As a result, the culture of physical violence and verbal provocation that is gaining ground in Putin’s Russia is deeply disturbing, whereas we tend to judge Chinese misdeeds with a greater sense of distance, if not indifference.
这些地区包括撒哈拉以南的非洲地区和中亚在内，由于出口收入，订单和资本流入出现下降，它们正在备受全球危机的折磨。	These regions, including Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia, are suffering harshly from the global crisis, owing to falling export earnings, remittances, and capital inflows.
2000—2008年，14家领先金融企业顶级高管的现金报酬（包括工资、奖金和/或已执行的股票期权）总数约为25亿美元，最多的五人就拿到了20亿美元。	The top executives at 14 leading financial firms received cash compensation (as salary, bonus, and/or stock options exercised) totaling roughly $2.5 billion in 2000-2008 – with five individuals alone receiving $2 billion.
但是，由于胎儿至少在堕胎时的发育阶段尚未发育出任何意识，这样也就有理由认为，结束它们的生命的严重性要比杀死一个正常的人要轻得多。	But, because fetuses, at least at the stage of development when most abortions are performed, have yet to develop any kind of consciousness, it seems reasonable to regard ending their lives as much less serious than killing a normal human being.
如果认为俄罗斯语西方之间的冲突将再次决定整个国际体系、进而让俄罗斯重获从前的超级大国地位，那么这些一厢情愿的预言并不难理解。	Such wishful thinking is predicated on the notion that conflict between Russia and the West would once again come to define the entire international system, thereby returning Russia to its former superpower status.
德国有限的军力、管制过度的服务业，以及基础设施投资的不足都表明，它在某些关键发展指标上已经落后东欧十年，虽然它是欧洲最强大经济体。	Germany’s limited military capacity, over-regulated service sector, and lack of infrastructure investment all indicate that it is lagging a decade behind Eastern Europe on some key development metrics, even if it is Europe’s foremost economic power.
但是，在1991年，在第一次海湾战争开始前，由于沙特阿拉伯认为这些在沙特工作的也门人是其国内安全的一个威胁，所以将 800,000个也门人驱逐出境。	But in 1991, 800,000 Yemenis were expelled because they were seen as a domestic security threat in the run-up to the first Gulf war.
但两百年来的大部分时间里，美国公民一直对联邦政府权力表示怀疑，包括从本质上说属��联邦特权的保持赤字的权力。	But for the better part of two centuries, its citizens have been suspicious of federal government power, including the power to run deficits, which is fundamentally a federal prerogative.
美国之所以“过度延伸”是因为它的全球负债与其国家资产之间已经逐渐失衡，而负有“领导义务”则是因为我们所熟知的这个世界就是围绕着这一点而设计的。	America was overstretched because its global liabilities were increasingly out of balance with its national assets, and it was bound to lead because the world as we know it is arranged favorably for it to do so.
去年其追随者在推倒残暴的独裁者穆阿迈尔·埃尔·卡扎菲（Muammar el-Qaddafi）上校一事上的确起了很重要的作用。	Last year, its adherents did play an important role in the removal of Libya’s brutal dictator, Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi.
欧洲需要拧成一股绳，这样才能在东进过程中稳稳地把自身锚定，而各自为政无法让欧洲在未来几年的动荡中屹立不倒。	A thickly woven cord is needed to keep Europe reliably anchored as it points eastward, whereas separate strands would withstand only a limited degree of strain in the turbulent years ahead.
上述风险包括自然灾害、极端天气、减少温室气体排放的政府行动以及可再生能源、节能和替代技术等技术革命所产生的连锁效果。	These risks include natural disasters, more extreme weather, efforts by governments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and the knock-on effect of a technological revolution in renewables, energy efficiency, and alternative technologies.
这些批评者担心，这将导致集体努力不够充分时说服各国进一步削减排放的难度增加，甚至让一些国家采用不合规的测量方法。	Such critics worry that this will make it harder to persuade countries to cut emissions further when it becomes clear that their collective efforts are not enough, and that it may even allow some countries to use irregular accounting methods.
中国和美国的确在反对伊斯兰极端恐怖主义的斗争中拥有共同的利益，中国也并未在联合国安理会阻止美国发动伊拉克战争。	China does have some common interests in fighting Islamic extremist terrorism, and it did not try to block America's path to the Iraqi war in the UN Security Council.
美国和欧洲仍享有巨大的资本存量的好处 — — 过去几十年甚至几百年所建成的机器、建筑和公共基础设施。	The US and Europe still enjoy the services of a vast capital stock – machines, buildings, and public infrastructure built over decades or even centuries.
要让退休金占GDP之比降低一个百分点，只需要经济以名义率4%增长两年 — — 根本不需要进一步削减。	To get pensions down by one percentage point of GDP, nominal economic growth of just 4% per year for two years would suffice – with no further cuts.
后来的研究者开始认识到成功的货币联盟还���要其他关键要素，而这些要素在没有深度政治一体化的情况下很难实现。	Later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union, which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration.
目前，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的部队自2012年以来首次重新控制了阿勒颇全境。 而巴沙尔是一位野蛮的独裁者，他想自己的人民（包括平民）发动战争，甚至使用化学武器。	President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces now control all of Aleppo for the first time since 2012, is a brutal dictator who has waged war on his own people, including civilians, and has even used chemical weapons.
这将节省���额开支，而且这些钱也可以重新投入到科技进步中去，并因此进一步武装欧洲海军去应对未来的威胁。	This would bring massive savings, which could be reinvested in technological advances, thereby further equipping Europe’s navies to meet future threats.
人们可以预料得到的是布什当局根据先前的联合国决议中隐含的警告正在推动新的和更加严厉的制裁，而且正如其在入侵伊拉克前夕那样说联合国的信誉度与此息息相关。	The Bush administration, predictably, is pushing for new and tougher sanctions, based on an implied warning in the earlier UN Resolution, and arguing, as it did in the run-up to the invasion in Iraq, that the UN’s credibility is at stake.
大脑、计算机和经济，这三者均是以通过个体单元 — — 神经元、晶体管或个人 — — 的合作和行为解决基本信息问题的机制。	The brain, the computer, and the economy: all three are devices whose purpose is to solve fundamental information problems in coordinating the activities of individual units – the neurons, the transistors, or individual people.
一旦巴沙尔总统垮台，叙利亚局势也可能向类似方向演变 — — 后卡扎菲的利比亚和后萨列赫的也门表明，此类国家要建立起一个团结的民主政权困难重重。	A similar scenario could unfold in Syria, if and when President Bashar al-Assad falls from power, while both post-Qaddafi Libya and post-Saleh Yemen point to the difficulties that these countries face in constructing a coherent democratic regime.
全球化也许偶尔碰壁，比如目前世界贸易的减速，但推动互联性的根本性技术变革必将继续让人和国家走得更近。	Globalization may occasionally hit speed bumps, such as the current slowdown in world trade; but the underlying technological changes driving interconnectivity will only continue to bring people and countries closer together.
赶在第二天早上游客到来之前，他们又开闸放水，于是这个死一般寂静的瀑布突然又像安装了某种虚拟视觉装置那样转眼间变得生机勃勃了。	Then, each morning, before the tourists reappear, they unceremoniously open the gates again, so that the eerily silent falls suddenly revive in a simulacrum of normalcy.
第二任期总统通常会使用典型的美国范式来处理棘手问题，而在第一个任期中他们无法这样做，因为连任才是第一要务。	Presidents in their second terms often apply old-fashioned American pragmatism to tough issues, which they often cannot do during their first terms, when reelection is their first priority.
联合国赞助了政府间气候变化委员会。 这是一个由全世界数百名科学家组成的组织，每隔几年向公众汇报有关气候变化的科学。	The UN sponsors the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a worldwide body of hundreds of climate scientists who report every few years to the public on the science of climate change.
因此无国界记者组织（Reporters Without Borders，RSF）与诺贝尔奖得主、科技专家、记者和人权活动家一起，发起了信息和民主委员会（Information and Democracy Commission ） 。	That is why Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is joining with Nobel laureates, technology specialists, journalists, and human rights activists to launch the Information and Democracy Commission.
中央银行客户是银行；银行可以在真正需要时向中央银行借钱，而中央银行的功能是支持银行部门，使银行可以在合理的业务经营中获得合理的利润。	Its clients are the banks; it is a place where banks can go to borrow money when they really need to; and its functions are to support the banking sector so that banks can make their proper profits as they go about their proper business.
对于许多女性及其家庭来说，成为一位母亲 — — 这一母亲节所赞美的庄严仪式 — — 却意味着要背负起恐惧，忧愁和牺牲的千斤重担。	Becoming a mother – the rite of passage that Mothers’ Day celebrates – can carry a terrible burden of fear, anxiety, and loss for many women and their families.
中东分析家侯赛因（Murtaza Hussain）最近观察道 ： “ 作为击败奥斯曼帝国统治者而建国的叙利亚和伊拉克曾经是统一国家，现在已经名存实亡 。 ”	As Middle East analyst Murtaza Hussain recently observed: “Syria and Iraq, formerly unified Arab states formed after the defeat of their former Ottoman rulers, exist today only in name.”
类似地，日本和印度也一直视为周边国家中的民主堡垒，在它们的邻国中，柬埔寨和老挝等国家一直被中国的霸权主义牢牢地控制着。	Likewise, Japan and India have long regarded Thailand as a democratic bulwark in a neighborhood where some regimes – Cambodia and Laos – are firmly under China’s hegemonic sway.
他们渴望用工作创造一个未来，让他们的生活称为世界最佳，有绿色的空间、可持续的公共交通、清洁的空气、漂亮的房子和安全的街道。	They want to work toward a future in which their quality of life is among the best in the world, with green spaces, sustainable public transport, clean air, well-built houses, and safe streets.
不但两者之间存在深刻的不信任，更广义的社会也没有形成更合理或更符合公共利益的更紧密关系。 这是有原因的。	Not only is it characterized by deep distrust, but the broader society does not find a closer relationship to be either legitimate or in the public interest, and for good reason.
欧盟把能源问题视为双边事务来处理的日子已成过去，因为目前有一些较大的成员国正尝试在牺牲欧洲整体利益的情况下维护自己的狭隘利益。	So it is past time that the European Union stopped treating energy as a bilateral issue, with some of the larger member states trying to protect their own narrow interests at the expense of the common European good.
事实上，如今和核能要比以前安全多了，但是，对很多人来说，一次类似福岛的大事故，不管最后结果怎样，便已足矣令他得出反对的结论。	Indeed, nuclear energy is a safer proposition now than ever before, but, for many people, the mere spectacle of an event like Fukushima – regardless of the outcome – is sufficient to draw the opposite conclusion.
税收方案主要是关于将中等收入家庭 — — 特别是那些来自倾向民主党的高税率州，比如纽约和加利福尼亚州 — — 的收入再分配给那些最富有的美国人。	The tax package is primarily about redistribution from middle-income households – particularly those in high-tax, Democratic-leaning states such as New York and California – to the richest Americans.
短期诱惑会不会太大以至于苹果公司管理层不愿把这1370亿美元放在银行，而是把一部分甚至全部投资于无法获得长期成功的项目中？	Could it be too tempting in the short run to Apple’s management to have that $137 billion in the bank, so that it spends some or all of it on investments that fail to pan out in the long run?
所有从亚伯拉罕传承下来的宗教信仰都有为了获得宗派社会的尊重而考虑新的环境因素从而做出改变的内在机制。	All the religions that descend from Abraham have internal mechanisms for change that allow them to reckon with new circumstances in ways that the confessional community can respect.
灵活信用额度（Flexible Credit Line）机制允许各国在无需回答任何问题的情况下迅速获取基金资源。	The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) facility grants immediate access to Fund resources, no questions asked.
2001、2002、2003年创纪录的低利率并未引发美国人更大的投资热情—超额产能（excess capacity）已经出现。	Record-low interest rates in 2001, 2002 and 2003 did not lead Americans to invest more – there was already excess capacity.
这不属于政客对海平面上升和气候变化问题是否要解决或如何解决存在分歧的状况；那些是适合民主制度探讨的政治问题。	These are not cases of politicians disagreeing about whether or how to address threats like sea-level rise and climate change; those would be political issues, and appropriate topics of discussion within a democratic system.
如今，美国政府即将撤销多德-弗兰克法（Dodd-Frank Act ） ， 近几年来的金融改革将倒退。	We now face the prospect of the US government revoking the Dodd-Frank Act and rolling back the financial reforms of recent years.
这个词由亚历山大·罗斯托（Alexander Rüstow）提出。 1932年，罗斯托宣称旧自由主义已经终结，呼吁采取以强国家角色为企业经营打造扎实法律基础为特征的新的自由主义。	It was coined by Alexander Rüstow, who in 1932 proclaimed the end of old liberalism and called for a new liberalism featuring a strong state that lays down a solid legal framework within which firms operate.
与此同时，许多高技能岗位 — — 主要是大规模能源和资本补贴的产物 — — 需要降级以产生更多的中等技能岗位。	At the same time, many high-skill jobs, largely a product of massive energy and capital subsidies, need to be downgraded to create more medium-skill positions.
依照这个观点，只有让人们亲眼看到巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿巴斯以及以色列总理内塔尼亚胡一起坐在了谈判桌前，后者所领导的右翼联合政府才有理由去部分冻结定居点建设。	According to this view, Netanyahu's right-wing coalition might be persuaded to accept the continuation of the partial settlement freeze, but only if the Israeli public sees President Mahmoud Abbas and Netanyahu publicly engaged in negotiations.
并非如此，战略投资分析师胡德·布洛克（H. Wood Brock）在其颇有意思的新书《美国僵局 》 （ The American Gridlock）中反驳道。	Not so, replies strategic investment analyst H. Wood Brock in an interesting new book, The American Gridlock.
只要每年花50亿美元，就有望保证受过良好训练的工作者遍布每一个非洲社区提供救命干预、有效响应埃博拉等卫生经济状况。	At a cost of just $5 billion per year, it would be possible to ensure that well-trained health workers are present in every African community to provide lifesaving interventions and respond effectively to health emergencies like Ebola.
法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙9月在巴黎索邦大学上发表一场引发了广泛影响的讲话，为欧盟在这一领域的决策注入了新的活力。	In a wide-ranging speech at the Sorbonne in September, French President Emmanuel Macron injected new energy into EU policymaking in this area.
面对这样的数字时，悲观者的回应是坚持中国最近的强劲经济表现只是暂时的 — — 是更加不可持续的刺激的产物。	When confronted with the numbers, pessimists respond by insisting that China’s recent strong economic performance is only temporary – a product of yet more unsustainable stimulus.
所以其实是我们欧洲人资助了俄罗斯在乌克兰和叙利亚的军事行动，以及该国对克里米亚，南奥塞梯，阿布哈兹，德涅斯特河沿岸地区的军事占领，还有俄罗斯军机在波罗的海和其他地方的挑衅性飞行。	So it is we Europeans who finance Russia’s wars in Ukraine and Syria, its military occupation of Crimea, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Transnistria, and the provocative flights of Russian military aircraft in the Baltic and elsewhere.
如果私营部门不能填补这一空白，那么责任就落在了多边开发银行和开发融资机构身上，而根据定义，它们就是为此目的而存在的。	If the private sector won’t fill this void, then the onus is on MDBs and DFIs, which, by definition, exist for this purpose.
为避免他们所谓的“政府控制 ” ， 报业业主成立了一个独立的新闻标准机构（IPSO ） ， 不对除本行业以外的任何人负责。	To preempt what they called “state control,” the newspaper proprietors set up an Independent Press Standards Organization (IPSO), accountable to no one but itself.
在这样的背景下，韩国诉诸世贸组织的举动 — — 以及正式纠纷可能对中国的国际声誉造成的潜在影响 — — 可能让中国领导人的精力集中在遏制风险升级上。	In this context, South Korea’s move to involve the WTO – and the risk to China’s international reputation that a formal dispute would imply – may have focused Chinese leaders’ minds concerning the risks of escalation.
与已经成为过去的超级大国和附属国家的时代不同，美国的影响力早已不在体现在美国大使废立领导人的能力上。	Unlike in the bygone era of superpowers and captive nations, American influence can no longer be defined by the ability to install and depose leaders from the US embassy.
但经济研究令人信服地证明，尽管补贴可以买来就业增加，但最终需要用增税来筹资，造成其他部门同样数量的岗位缩减。	But economic research convincingly shows that while subsidies can buy extra jobs, they eventually have to be financed with increased taxes, costing an equal number of jobs elsewhere.
在为阿萨德王朝卖命多年后，真主党目前正致力于恢复其在国内的合法性，甚至支持反伊朗运动3·14联盟（March 14 Alliance）的逊尼派领导人萨德·哈里里（Saad Hariri）重新担任总理。	After years of service to the Assad dynasty, Hezbollah is now working to recover its domestic legitimacy, even pushing for the return of Saad Hariri, the Sunni leader of the anti-Iranian March 14 Alliance, to his post as prime minister.
如今，新兴国家制造商提供了联合国机构发展中世界疫苗采购量的约50 % ， 而1997年时这一比例还不到10 % 。	Today, emerging-country manufacturers produce about 50% of vaccines purchased by United Nations agencies for use in the developing world, up from less than 10% in 1997.
2009年10月，亚美尼亚和土耳其在苏黎世签署了远见卓识的协议；但更广泛的地区力量最终阻碍了进展，其中俄罗斯的干预是决定性的。	A far-sighted agreement was signed by Armenia and Turkey in Zürich in October 2009; but wider regional forces eventually blocked progress, with Russian intervention decisive.
2016年，中国的经常项目盈余下降到只有GDP的2.1 % ， 国际货币基金组织（IMF）预测，随着出口的继续下降，中国的经常项目盈余还将进一步减少。	China’s current-account surplus fell to just 2.1% of GDP in 2016, and the International Monetary Fund projects it to narrow further, as exports continue to fall.
欧盟15国自1995年来共有26次移民政策改革：其中三分之二都增加了签证申请人面对的程序障碍，缩短了工作许可的有效时间，抑或增大了家庭团聚的难度。	Since 1995, there were 26 reforms of migration policies in the EU-15: two-thirds tightened regulations by increasing procedural obstacles faced by visa applicants, reducing the duration of work permits, or making family reunification more difficult.
平心而论，特朗普对博弈论的直觉式使用风险很高，因为他在与对合作没有表现出任何兴趣的行动方玩边缘政策。	To be sure, Trump’s intuitive use of game theory is risky, because he is pursuing brinkmanship with actors that have shown zero interest in cooperation.
在拥有250名成员的中国共产党中央委员会（这是一个包含中共首脑和地方省市大员的精英团体）中，有60人声称自己拥有博士学位。	Of the 250 members of provincial Communist Party standing committees, an elite group including party chiefs and governors, 60 claim to have earned PhDs.
去年5月，在国防大学（National Defense University）的演讲中，奥巴马为美国使用无人机开脱。	Last May, in a speech at the National Defense University, Obama defended America’s use of drones.
但墨西哥不是个例，它的经历对所有新兴经济体都有借鉴意义，因为特朗普质疑的是整个全球贸易框架和开放性。	But Mexico is not alone, and its experience is relevant for all emerging economies, because Trump has called into question the entire framework of global trade and openness.
提尔反驳了机器人末日论者常常持有的观点 — — 人工智能和先进机器人对劳动力的影响将复制全球化对发达国家工人影响。	Thiel, for his part, refutes the argument – often made by robot doomsayers – that the impact of artificial intelligence and advanced robotics on the labor force will mirror globalization’s impact on advanced-country workers.
但仅有15%的最边缘农民（拥有土地面积不到一公顷）能够得到正式信贷，因此信贷豁免对最贫困人口几乎没有什么帮助。	However, only 15% of the most marginal farmers (those with less than one hectare of land) have access to formal credit, so a loan waiver does little to help the poorest.
基拉里、柯拉科夫斯基和赫鲁晓夫：这三人各自的人生都是如今新欧洲团结趋势下的典型，在这个欧洲里，那些昔日对手之间洋溢着的，是和睦和谅解的气氛。	Király, Kolakowski, and Khrushchev: each in his own way is a symbol of today’s new and uniting Europe, a Europe of rapprochement and forgiveness among erstwhile opponents.
1960年，联合国食品和农业组织（FAO）谈到了不经济的伐木行为，例如“ 木头滚滑法（head-skidding ） ” （即将木头滚下山去，同时将树木带着土壤连根拔起 ） 。	In 1960, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization spoke of wasteful logging practices, such as “head-skidding” (in which a log is rolled downhill, ripping up plants and soil).
首先，他表示在科罗拉多州和华盛顿州强推联邦大麻相关法律并不是其政府的当务之急；他“另有要事”要先办。	First, he said that enforcing federal marijuana legislation in Colorado and Washington was not a priority of his administration; he had “other fish to fry.”
“如果印钞可以让银行和企业免于灭顶之灾 ， ” 他在1966年指出 ， “ 那么今天的选民将会保证任何上台的政党[这样]做 。 ”	“If printing bits of green can save banks and business from ruin,” he argued in 1966, “today’s electorate will ensure that either party in power will [so] act.”
较低的长期利率和较弱的美元对美国股市来说是利好，而特朗普的亲商日程理论上对个股来说也是利好，即使目前的氛围让人们要退出所谓的特朗普再通胀交易。	Lower long-term interest rates and a weaker dollar are good news for US stock markets, and Trump’s pro-business agenda is still good for individual stocks in principle, even if the air has been let out of the so-called Trump reflation trade.
对于美国来说，如果要实现目标，就意味着要减少目前人均碳排放量的10 % 。 而对中国来说，就是实现一种全新的低碳排放发展模式。	For the US, such commitments would mean cutting emissions to around one-tenth of today’s per capita level, while for China it would mean creating a new low-carbon model of economic development.
全球金融危机后，美国很快开始严重依赖扩张性货币政策，其特征是近零利率和大规模资产购买，美元于是贬值，从而刺激出口。	Soon after the global financial crisis, the US relied heavily on expansionary monetary policy, characterized by near-zero interest rates and large-scale asset purchases, which weakened the dollar, thereby boosting exports.
阿尔•穆拉的意思是，虽然伊斯兰主义者在埃及最近的选举中获胜，但是他们既不能获得行政权也无法控制新宪法的形成。	Al-Mulla’s message was that the Islamists’ victory in Egypt’s recent election gives them neither executive power nor control of the framing of a new constitution.
不幸的是，去年7月的军队干涉也仅仅是扶持了另一个无力构建长期性机制的政权，自然也无法去孕育政治和解并实现包容性增长。	Unfortunately, the military intervention last July gave rise to yet another regime that seems unable to build durable institutions that could foster political reconciliation and deliver inclusive growth.
但西班牙的出口比英国的出口复苏得快，而由汇率所传导的通胀压力目前已成为英国未来货币政策的主要制约因素。	But Spanish exports recovered more quickly than British exports, and inflationary pressure via the exchange rate is now a major constraint on future British monetary policy.
过不了多久，在加纳路边购买“Kofi broke man ” — —烤芭蕉配花生 — — 可以不需要现金，从而让小贩富在当下，储为未来。	Before too long, buying a “Kofi broke man” – a roasted plantain with groundnuts – by the roadside in Ghana could be a cashless transaction, one that helps the vendor prosper in the present – and save for the future.
我们有信心，欧洲会团结起来共同行动应对这些挑战，我们也将继续支持欧洲的努力，因为欧洲稳定和增长与我们所有人息息相关。	We are confident that Europe will act together to meet these challenges, and we will continue to support such efforts, because European stability and growth matter for us all.
在多个平台上设置不同的议程 — — 五年计划，三中全会和中央经济工作会议 — — 是解决困惑和潜在冲突的良药。	Setting different agendas on multiple platforms – Five-Year Plans, Third Plenums, and Work Conferences – is a recipe for confusion and potential conflict.
因此，他们广邀在国民会议中未得充分代表的那一部分国民。 他们在宪法进程当家作主的意识不仅对于实施宪法、而且对于弥合民族伤口而言都是十分重要的。	Accordingly, they sought out those who were under-represented in the Assembly, but whose sense of participation in and ownership of the process was essential, not merely to the constitutional exercise, but to binding the nation’s wounds.
在这种情况下西方领导人选择了后者，扩大北约和欧盟，将俄罗斯自由派人士关于这些政策会强化俄罗斯专制主义的警告置诸脑后。	In the event, says Lukin, Western leaders chose the second option, expanding NATO and the European Union, while paying no heed to Russian liberals who warned that these policies would strengthen Russian authoritarianism.
报告显示，尽管绝大多数市民相信在本地区内爆发进一步的武装冲突不太可能，但公众的情绪 — — 除科索沃和阿尔巴尼亚以外 — — 却都甚为悲观。	While the overwhelming majority of citizens are convinced that further armed conflict in the region is unlikely, the public’s mood – with the exception of Kosovars and Albanians – is pessimistic.
前犹他州州长、共和党总统候选人约恩·亨茨曼（Jon Huntsman）在寻求赢得党内提名以挑战总统奥巴马（以失败而告终）的过程中明确地提出了这一问题并一再强调。	Former Utah Governor and Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman addressed this issue clearly and repeatedly as he sought – unsuccessfully – to win his party’s nomination to challenge President Barack Obama.
在其选举后的第一次公开演讲中，巴拉克·奥巴马宣称，其任期“在美国在气候变化上的领导地位方面，标志着一个增强我们的安全并创造大量的新工作机会的新篇章 ” 。	In his first, post-election public address, Barack Obama declared that his presidency “will mark a new chapter in America’s leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs.”
只要你稍懂物理学和工程学 — — 俄罗斯人对这两个学科可是很擅长的 — — 就能看出，该系统正是为了这一目的而设。	Anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of physics and engineering – two subjects at which Russians excel – can see that the system is designed to do precisely that.
美国对2001年9月11日恐怖袭击对策的某些方面也反映了同样的趋势 — — 但其规模和造成的影响却远远超过以色列。	Some aspects of the United States’ response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, reflect the same tendency – but on a significantly larger scale and with more far-reaching consequences.
这些疾病每年都要影响约14亿人，八廓5亿多儿童，造成鲜为人知的病痛，并且因为导致生产率损失而恶化贫困循环。	These illnesses afflict approximately 1.4 billion people per year, including more than 500 million children, causing untold pain and suffering and, through lost productivity, contributing to the cycle of poverty.
但如今债务水平已大幅上升，全球实际利率的急剧上升几乎肯定会使当前正在酝酿的危机蔓延到已遭打击的少数几个国家（包括阿根廷和土耳其）之外。	Today, however, debt levels have risen significantly, and a sharp rise in global real interest rates would almost certainly extend today’s brewing crises beyond the handful of countries (including Argentina and Turkey) that have already been hit.
如今，邓小平为了防止中国再次陷入独裁而规定的主席任期限制已经被取消，中共王朝的未来将系于最高领袖一身。	Now that the presidential term limits introduced by Deng Xiaoping to insulate the country against another one-man dictatorship have been eliminated, the future of the Communist dynasty rests on the shoulders of one supreme leader.
在这种情况下，推行如此规模的改革可能进一步打击土耳其民主，为埃尔多安获得推行其越来越任性的外交政策创造更多空间。	In these circumstances, a reform of this magnitude would be another blow to Turkish democracy, with Erdoğan gaining even more latitude to pursue his increasingly wayward foreign policy.
只要看看越来越多在德国取得骄人成绩的土耳其人后裔，再想想那些身着西服、手提笔记本电脑飞遍全球的英国第二代印度和巴基斯坦人后裔就明白了。	Look at the growing number of prominent citizens of Turkish origin in Germany. Consider the many second generation Indian and Pakistani Britons who are now seen in business suits carrying laptop computers and flying around the world.
如果缅甸士兵滥用武力甚至将枪口对准平民，缓和紧张局势就无从谈起；事实上，这样的方针更有可能助长而不是平息暴力圣战。	It will be impossible to ease tensions if soldiers are using disproportionate force, much less targeting civilians; indeed, such an approach is more likely to fuel than quell violent jihadism.
中国在韩国出口总量中所占的份额随着中国的经济增长而大幅飙升，从2001年到2013年间实现了翻番，从12%增长到24 % 。	As China’s economic growth soared, so did its share of South Korea’s total exports, which doubled, from 12% to 24%, in the period from 2001 to 2013.
诚然，所有这些不只是占领军队的善举，也是冷战初期的结果，也是双方力图巩固“他们”那部分的德国的结果。	All this, to be sure, was not just benevolence on the part of the occupying powers. It was also a result of the incipient Cold War, and the desire of both sides to consolidate “their” part of Germany.
与此同时，正如笔者在近二十年来一直指出的那样，所有这些现金都主要用于促进地下经济 — — 而非合法经济 — — 的增长。	And, as I have been arguing for two decades, all this cash is facilitating growth mainly in the underground economy, not the legal one.
这个组织在去年六月也引起过公众的注意 — — 300名全副武装的成员在班加西游行，煽动利比亚人民的愤怒情绪。	The Brigade attracted public attention last June as well, when around 300 armed members staged a rally in Benghazi, sparking outrage among Libyans.
这一战略应该基于弗里德曼的“直升机撒钱”主张 — — 大规模印钞并分配给公众总是能够刺激经济、解决通缩问题。	Such a strategy should be based on Friedman’s assertion that “helicopter drops” – printing large sums of money and distributing it to the public – can always stimulate the economy and combat deflation.
这相当于符合资格的国家可以根据其基本面状况以及政策记录随时获取一笔预先批准好的贷款,因此也是防止自我强化型流动性危机的完美工具。	It amounts to a pre-approved loan that eligible countries can obtain whenever they want, on the basis of the strength of their fundamentals and policy record. It is thus the perfect tool for preventing self-fulfilling liquidity crises.
财政研究中心（Institute for Fiscal Studies，IFS）的分析认为，国库将节约120亿英镑，而提高最低工资所导致的薪酬总增量仅为40亿英镑。	An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has concluded that while the Treasury will save £12 billion, the gross increase in pay from the higher minimum wage amounts to only £4 billion.
此外，根据双边协定，美国将有权使用七座哥伦比亚基地，并部署高达 1400 名（包括 800 名士兵和 600 名私人承包商）不受哥伦比亚法律管辖的人员。	Moreover, under a bilateral agreement, the US will have access to seven Colombian military bases, deploying up to 1,400 men (800 soldiers and 600 private contractors) with legal immunity under Colombian law.
约翰·克里国务卿有关美国对古塔大屠杀的军事应对计划可能“令人难以置信的微不足道”的描述几乎彻底消灭了美国在叙利亚和俄罗斯官员眼中的威胁。	Secretary of State John Kerry’s description of the planned US military response to the Ghouta massacre as likely to be “unbelievably small” almost derailed the utility of the US threat in concentrating Syrian and Russian officials’ minds.
在信仰犹太教的以色列也并非与这种现象绝缘，在那里信仰弥赛亚的狂热分子和宗教民族主义者笃信一种质疑民主制度的合法性的政治神学。	Nor is the Jewish state of Israel, where Messianic fanatics and religious nationalists have embraced a political theology that questions the very legitimacy of the democratic institutions, immune from this phenomenon.
《纽约时报》告诉读者 ： “ 在越南，有超过2000万人口，而此区域内的人口几近总人口数的1/4，这片将被淹没的区域 ” 。	The Times told readers, “More than 20 million people in Vietnam, almost one-quarter of the population, live on land that will be inundated.”
除非破产人和失败的项目可以迅速而平稳地退出系统，否则市场将饱受坏账和烂尾工程的纠缠，耗费宝贵的信贷资源，拖累收入、增长及就业表现。	Unless failed borrowers and projects exit the system quickly and smoothly, the market will be saddled with bad debt and incomplete projects, undermining its performance.
人们不管如果各国政府让它们的货币与美元自由浮动，而非采取严格的联系汇率，绝大多数的危机本来可以避免，至少可以大幅度减轻。	Never mind that most of the crises could have been avoided, or late least substantially mitigated, if governments had let their currencies float against the dollar, rather than adopting rigid exchange-rate pegs.
联合国负责人道主义救援的官员珍·艾格兰德不加修饰的称西方国家尤其是美国 “吝啬 ” ， 可谓一语中的。	Plainly, the comment by Jan Egeland, the United Nations official in charge of humanitarian assistance, calling the West “stingy,” hit home, especially in the United States.
而那些高明的政策制定者们则殚精竭虑，誓为美国问题丛生的货币系统找一个替代品，甚至暗示要回归金本位了。	Prominent policymakers, desperate for alternatives to America’s malfunctioning monetary system, have gone so far as to allude to a return to the gold standard.
为了平衡巴基斯坦的未来，西方的帮助和支持将是至关重要的。 但这就意味着承认穆沙拉夫不是唯一能够解决巴基斯坦众多的问题和管理反恐战争的领导人。	With Pakistan’s future in the balance, the West’s help and support will be crucial, but that means recognizing that Musharraf is not the only leader who can resolve Pakistan’s myriad problems and manage the war on terror.
这一政策持续实施的空间已经快要告罄了，因为从四猪国流向欧元区核心国的欧洲央行货币流正在挤出通过在四猪国进行的再融资操作所创造的货币。	The capacity for continuing this policy will soon be depleted, as the central-bank money flowing from the GIPS countries to the core countries of the eurozone increasingly crowds out the money created through refinancing operations there.
我们需要一个生产率高、适应性好、创新性强、技能多样的世界，用技术和文化去寻找我们所面临的诸多挑战的解决办法。	We need a world of people who are productive, resilient, creative, and versatile enough with technology and culture to find solutions to the many challenges we face.
此项收入占上述国家GDP的约7 % （ 委内瑞拉和玻利维亚超过11 % ， 厄瓜多尔和墨西哥则占8 % ） 。	This comes to around 7% of GDP in these countries (more than 11% in Venezuela and Bolivia, and 8% in Ecuador and Mexico).
《金融时报》的马丁·桑德卜（Martin Sandbu）强烈支持这一观点：可行的货币和金融联盟并不要求财政一体化。	Martin Sandbu of the Financial Times has been a strong proponent of the view that a workable monetary and financial union does not require fiscal integration.
但1933年的先例能给我们以某种启示，当时富兰克林·罗斯福为一个处在经济灾难和公众信心崩溃边缘的民族奉献了鼓舞人心的讲演和“大胆的实验 ” 。	But a more instructive precedent is 1933, when Franklin Roosevelt offered inspiring rhetoric and “bold experimentation” to a nation facing economic meltdown and a breakdown in public confidence.
以至于在可能性和必要性之间左右为难的以色列人和巴勒斯坦人，都已经学会了如何在没有和平方案的情境下生活。	Trapped between the possible and the necessary, Israelis and Palestinians simply learned to live without a solution.
但是欧盟委员会要做的应该在联盟各方履行其竞选承诺后在2020年更好地推动更具针对性的结构改革，而不是通过叫停意大利2019年预算来冒着危机全面爆发的风险。	But, rather than risk a full-scale crisis by blocking Italy’s 2019 budget, the European Commission would do better to push for more focused structural reforms in 2020, after the coalition parties have met their campaign promises.
前南国际法庭的第一位首席检察官理查德·戈德斯通（Richard Goldstone）呼吁谴责种族迫害，目的是使所有各方超越身份政治，建立起更为自由的政治秩序。	The ICTY’s first chief prosecutor, Richard Goldstone, called for condemnation of ethnic persecution in order to enable all sides to transcend identity politics and move towards a more liberal political order.
其次，对大部分全球投资者来说，这些经济体的债券几乎是资产组合配置的天然组成部分，因此这些国家的政府预算赤字部分可以用其他国家的储蓄来融资。	Second, for most global investors, these economies’ bonds are a quasi-automatic component of portfolio allocations, so their governments’ budget deficits are financed in part by other countries’ savings.
皇家帝斯曼公司（Royal DSM由本文作者之一领导）制定了每吨50欧元的碳价格，与米其林、达能和通用汽车等跨国公司一起运用有意义的碳定价来让业务“与时俱进 ” 。	Royal DSM (which is led by one of the authors) has set a carbon price of €50 ($59) per ton, joining other global companies like Michelin, Danone, and General Motors in applying meaningful carbon prices to “future-proof” their business.
埃克森美孚、雪弗龙、美国商会和科赫工业都是主要的参与者，几乎所有共和党国会议员都参与了这种可耻的行动。	ExxonMobil, Chevron, the US Chamber of Commerce, and Koch Industries are all major players, and almost all of the Republican members of Congress are implicated in this disgraceful behavior.
事实上，增长复苏极有可能导致更大的经常项目赤字，即便储蓄率有所改善、国内能源产量增加减少石油和天然气进口。	Indeed, it is very likely that reviving growth will lead to larger current-account deficits, even if the savings rate improves and domestic energy production curtails oil and gas imports.
归根结底，这位以色列总理已经明确表示他倾向于与“经济和平”有关的持续性冲突管理，而不是以相互尊重与合作为基础的影响深远的政治进程。	After all, the Israeli Prime Minister has made it clear that he favors continued conflict management in terms of “economic peace” over far-reaching political processes based on mutual respect and cooperation.
在这一情形中，如果市场是经济学家所谓的完美竞争市场，则一旦所有投入的机会成本都得到补偿，就不会剩下什么可供分配。	In this context, if markets are characterized by what economists call perfect competition, once the opportunity cost of all inputs has been paid, there is nothing left to distribute.
因此这类直接和谈的前景并不只有内塔尼亚胡和阿巴斯决定，而取决于两人如何与各自阵营内部的极端派别打好关系。	The future of these direct peace talks thus depends not only on Netanyahu and Abbas, but also on how they relate to the extremists within their camps.
20世纪80年代叙利亚主导“阿拉伯威慑部队”干预黎巴嫩内战的情况也并未好到哪去，既未能结束那场残酷的战争，也未能保护弱势的巴勒斯坦难民群体。	The Syria-dominated “Arab Deterrent Force” did not fare much better when it intervened in Lebanon’s civil war in the 1980s, failing either to end the brutal fighting or to secure vulnerable Palestinian refugees.
但这个金额仅相当于德国年度GDP0.1%的计划更像是为了安抚欧洲其他国家的权宜之计，而非一个真心诚意的政策变革。	But, at just 0.1% of Germany’s annual GDP, Schäuble’s scheme looks more like an attempt to quiet criticism from the rest of Europe than a genuine policy shift.
简言之，我不苟同大众观点，他们认为因特网和私人计算机出现后，下一轮革新典范的出现将历时颇长。 人工智能使未来十年摇摇晃晃。	Barring another round of deep financial crises, it won’t be – as long as politicians do not stand in the way of the new paradigm of trade, technology, and artificial intelligence.
人们会对我说 ， “ 要是能坐在比尔·盖茨旁边就好了 … … ”上周，一位朋友在一次会议上把我拉到一旁询问 ： “ 有什么好办法让会议更有利于人们会面 ？ ”	Just last week, a friend pulled me aside at a conference to ask for advice. “What’s the best way to make conferences more efficient for meeting people?” he asked.
尽管金融产品创新不断引导环境、社会和治理投资，但绿色债券等环境、社会和治理金融工具的供应却依然不足。	Despite innovation in the financial products channeling ESG investment, the supply of ESG instruments, such as green bonds, remains insufficient.
高技能移民是不少世界领先的科技和创新枢纽实现增长的关键因素 — — 从硅谷到爱尔兰、印度和中国台湾莫不如此。	Skilled migrants have been essential to the growth of some of the world’s leading hubs of technology and innovation – from Silicon Valley to Ireland, India, and Taiwan.
许多其他服务内需的行业也取得了双位数的增长，表明国内消费已经在为中国的GDP增长做出更重要的贡献了。	Many other industry segments serving domestic demand are also growing at double-digit rates, suggesting that domestic consumption is already making a more significant contribution to China’s GDP growth.
这些目标极为重要，因为它们将决定超过2.5万亿美元的发展资金如何分配给从气候变化到疟疾等诸多发展目标。	These targets are vitally important, because they will determine how more than $2.5 trillion in development money is spent on everything from climate change to malaria.
将欧盟结构性资金导向创新领域是很重要的，因为与我们的全球伙伴比起来，我们在研发方面的支出之少足以引起警惕。	Channeling EU structural funds towards innovation is essential, given that spending on research and development is alarmingly low compared to our global partners.
加州虽然大力增税并削减开支，但仍面对 200 亿美元的财政赤字，其财政困境正是其他次国家或国家政府的先兆。	Now facing another $20 billion deficit despite temporary tax hikes and spending cuts, California’s fiscal woes foreshadow those of many sub-national – or, indeed, national –governments globally.
事实上，有史以来最成功的出口导向型增长经历 — — 来自日本，韩国，台湾和中国 — — 都是在美国和欧洲设置的进口关税出于中等水平时发生的，而且那时的关税比现在要高。	In fact, the most phenomenal export-oriented growth experiences to date – Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China – all occurred when import tariffs in the US and Europe were at moderate levels, and higher than where they are today.
达到这种高水平的认知功能需要的不仅仅是文化智力，还需要文化的逐步积累，即对文化的修正会随着时间的推移而不断累积。	To achieve such high levels of cognitive functioning requires not just cultural intelligence, but also cumulative culture, in which modifications accumulate over time.
英国查塔姆研究所（Chatham House）和其他独立观察家警告，在促进卫生改善方面花费达到GDP的5%的建议目标的国家太少，特别是发展中国家。	As Chatham House and other independent observers have warned, too few governments – particularly in developing countries – spend the recommended 5% of annual GDP on promoting health.
此外，与软件开发相比，这些活动还要求更多的基础设施、物流、监管、资质、供应链和其他商业服务 — — 所有这些都需要协调众多公共和私人实体。	And, compared to software development, these activities also require more infrastructure, logistics, regulation, certifications, supply chains, and a host of other business services – all of which demand coordination with public and private entities.
如果特朗普希望在2020年大选之前在对华贸易上实现“大胜 ” ， 那么他需要尽可能快地与习近平达成协议。	If Trump wants a “big win” on Chinese trade to boast about ahead of the 2020 election, he will need to strike a deal with Xi fairly quickly.
比如说一个汽车工程师可能不会购买汽车公司的股票甚至会故意做空其中某个股票，以便对冲他或者她自身特定种类的人力资本风险。	For example, an automotive engineer might not buy automotive stocks – and might even short them – as a way to hedge the risk to his or her own particular type of human capital.
但这些发现或许会对当今的政策制定者有所裨益 — — 比如有助于确立一系列法案的先后次序，或者确定哪些政策介入的新可能性需要进一步研究。	Yet the findings may be useful to lawmakers even today – for example, in assigning priorities among several plausible initiatives, or in identifying new possibilities for policy interventions that deserve further study.
但据俄罗斯公共意见研究中心的民意调查，如果总统选举现在才举行的话，普京可能只能获得47%的选票，他将被迫进入第二轮选举。	But according to a poll conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, if a presidential election were held now, Putin would probably receive only 47% of the vote, forcing him into a second-round run-off.
麦肯锡全球研究院的一项研究指出，到2025年时全面联网的物联网每年可为全球经济规模额外增添11万亿美元。	According to a McKinsey Global Institute study, a fully networked Internet of Things (IoT) could add up to $11 trillion to the global economy every year by 2025.
马尼拉—一些专家说，中国的经济奇迹 — — 让3亿人摆脱贫困并改变了世界地缘政治重心 — — 正在走向混乱的终局。	MANILA – To hear some pundits tell it, China’s economic miracle – one that lifted 300 million people out of poverty and shifted the world’s geopolitical center of gravity – is coming to a tumultuous end.
也许最重要的是，即使经济增长减速，科技变革仍能以极快的速度发展，这就引起了一个似乎无法解决的问题，即其对全球经济的潜在影响力几何。	Perhaps most important, even as economic growth slows, technological change continues at a breakneck pace, raising seemingly unanswerable questions about its potential impact on the global economy.
其次，显然，如果希腊已经无法偿付现有贷款 ， “ 援助”所要求的紧缩条件将摧毁希腊的名义收入，让国民债务更加不可持续。	Second, it was obvious that if Greece already could not repay its existing loans, the austerity conditions on which the “bailouts” were premised would crush Greek nominal incomes, making the national debt even less sustainable.
因此，我们耳熟能详的主张 — — 不平等性加剧是现时代的核心经济事实 — — 也许是因为另外一种差异：在国际争论中，发达国家专家和新闻媒体影响太大。	So the often-heard assertion that rising inequality is the central economic fact of our times is probably due to a disparity of a different kind: the outsize impact of rich-country pundits and news outlets on international debates.
7月，两位总理在俄罗斯乌法进行了意料外的会面，但双边关系并未获得进展，双方立刻就否认了对方关于讨论内容和所达成的一致的陈述。	An unexpected meeting of the two prime ministers in Ufa, Russia, in July produced little progress, with both sides immediately repudiating each other’s statements about what was discussed and agreed.
该计划由彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro，加州大学欧文分校经济学家）和威尔伯·罗斯（Wilbur Ross，投资者）执笔，宣称特朗普总统将提振增长、降低国民债务。	Authored by Peter Navarro (an economist at the University of California-Irvine) and Wilbur Ross (an investor), the plan claims that a President Trump would boost growth and reduce the national debt.
在1970年开始的审查中，联合农药残留会议一直认定如果按正确方式施用， 2,4-D 不会危害陆地或水域中任何人或物的健康。	In reviews beginning in 1970, the JMPR has always found that when 2,4-D is applied correctly, it does not pose a health threat to anyone or anything on land or water.
目前美国是墨西哥最大的商品贸易伙伴 — — 该国约80％的商品都出口到美国，而墨西哥反过来也是美国第三大贸易伙伴（继加拿大和中国之后 ） 。	The US is by far Mexico’s largest trading partner in merchandise – about 80% of its goods exports go to the US – while Mexico is America’s third-largest trading partner (after Canada and China).
认为不需在伊朗问题上继续进行外交努力的还有另一个源头：处于伊朗核弹头射程内的以色列，它将受有核伊朗威胁最大的国家。	There has been another avenue to cutting short diplomacy with Iran: Israel, which would lie within range of a nuclear-armed Iranian missile, and therefore is most threatened by that prospect.
当金融危机爆发时，南欧欧元区国家利用它们的印钞权利，实质上从欧元系统中借取它们在市场中无法借到的资金。	When the financial crisis hit, the southern euro countries took advantage of their right to print money, effectively borrowing from the euro system what they could not borrow in the markets.
实现所有这些目标需要各级官员一心一意地服务经济，而不是像在多数情况下那样 — — 反过来要经济适应他。	Achieving all of this requires that the bureaucracy focus on serving the economy, rather than – as has too often been the case – vice versa.
就算不作为（或者是着眼于长远的行动）才是最佳政策，但对那些通过民主选举出来的政客来说这可不是一个选项，选民希望他们能有所行动，于是无法避免地意味着采取一些追求短期效应的行为。	Even if inaction (or action oriented towards the longer term) is the best policy, it is not an option for democratically elected politicians, whom voters expect to govern, which inevitably means action with the potential for quick results.
因此我组织了多项研究帮助我们制定扩大9月入学规模的战略，并在教育和高等教育部建立了一个项目管理团队，他们的唯一任务是确保我们能够实现这一目标。	So I have commissioned a number of studies to help us craft a scaled-up enrollment strategy for September, and installed a project-management team in the ministry whose sole task is to make sure that we can reach this goal.
尽管这样的交易能满足以色列安全需要，但这意味着放弃强硬���犹太复国主义者和宗教极端分子的大以色列计划。	Although such a deal might satisfy Israel’s security needs, it would mean abandoning the Greater Israel project championed by hardline Zionists and religious extremists.
弗兰克·拉姆齐（Frank Ramsey）在1927年发表了一篇经典论文，指出如果要尽量减少因税收引起的经济扭曲，就该对所有的活动都征税，并提出了一个税率设定方法。	Frank Ramsey published a classic paper in 1927 arguing that to minimize taxation-induced distortions, one should tax all activities, and he proposed how to set tax rates.
第二，我认为存在人权遭到极大践踏、人们不得不不顾国际法受到道义驱使采取行动的情形，但是科索沃并不属于这种情况。	Secondly, I argued that while there might be occasions when, regardless of international law, human rights abuses are so severe that one is morally obliged to act, Kosovo was not such a case.
长期零真实利率会带来资产泡沫、资源配置不当和意料之外的收入不平等等风险，最近的历史（不仅仅是美国和日本）证明了这一点。	Long periods of zero real interest rates carry the danger of asset bubbles, misallocation of resources, and unintended effects on income inequality, as recent history – not least in the US and Japan – demonstrates.
用这些原则来衡量，里根在第2和第4项上是失败的，并也只是在默认的情况下采取了第1项—Paul Volcker在1980年代的反通胀政策让里根及其亲信们深感沮丧。	Measured against these principles, Reagan failed on (2) and (4) and adopted (1) only by default – Paul Volcker’s anti-inflation policy in the 1980’s dismayed many of Reagan’s close aides.
在2008年，政府不顾其他政党的强烈反对，修改了《社团组织法》并允许宗教少数群体组织购买地产（并接受金额不限的海外捐助 ） 。	In 2008, the government, despite fierce opposition from other political parties, changed the Law of Associations and allowed religious-minority associations to purchase real estate (and to receive contributions, regardless of size, from abroad).
一个模式是《蒙特利尔破坏臭氧层物质议定书 》 （ Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer ） ， 该议定书显著降低了含氯氟烃水平，彰显出包容性多边主义的潜力。	One model is the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which has succeeded spectacularly in reducing levels of chlorofluorocarbons, highlighting the continued potential of inclusive multilateralism.
但是，在任何一个给定时点，仅仅是达到这些目标（或更糟糕的，仅仅是接近这些目标）并不能构成成员资格的全部基础。	But merely hitting these targets (or, worse, just approaching them) at any given point in time has proved to be an inadequate foundation for membership.
在1960年代的经济起飞之际，日本开始了和该地区主要国家的严肃对话，以求增进与这些一度被其征服和占领过的国家之间的关系。	In the 1960’s, as its economic takeoff was proceeding, Japan initiated a serious dialogue with regional players, aiming to build stronger relations with countries that it had once conquered and occupied.
2004年，在中国对日本的亚洲杯决赛上，中国球迷穿着20世纪30年代的日本军服来表达他们对日本队的敌意。	During the 2004 Asia Nations Cup final, which pitted China against Japan, Chinese supporters wore 1930’s-style Japanese military uniforms to express their hostility to the Japanese team.
美国支持者相信，伊朗公民社会和社交媒体的活跃有利于这个国家，希望一个向全球市场开放的伊朗在政治上也变得自由。	American supporters believed that the vibrancy of Iranian civil society and social media boded well for the country, and hoped an Iran that was open to global markets would become more liberal politically.
从这种意义上来说 ， 《 路西法效应》祝贺了人类选择善良而不是残忍，关爱而不是冷漠，创造而不是破坏，以及英雄主义而不是邪恶行为的能力。	In this sense, The Lucifer Effect is a celebration of the human capacity to choose kindness over cruelty, caring over indifference, creativity over destructiveness, and heroism over villainy.
在这方面，地区贸易壁垒 — — 阿拉伯世界的这个问题甚至比撒哈拉以南非洲还要普遍 — — 必须打破。	To this end, regional trade barriers, which are more pervasive in the Arab world than even in Sub-Saharan Africa, must be dismantled.
欧盟领导人必须明确承诺不惜一切代价解决难民危机 — — 即使这意味着通过既不便利也不受欢迎的扩大合法移民方案的措施。	EU leaders must make a clear commitment to do what it takes to address the refugee crisis – even if that means pushing through measures, such as expanded options for legal migration, that are neither expedient nor popular.
为了研究PKDL患者是否是黑热病的携带者 — — 从而加强我们根治这种疾病的能力 — — 我的团队和我建立了无菌培养室繁殖沙蝇。	In order to find out whether PKDL patients can act as a reservoir for VL – and therefore boost our capacity to eradicate the disease – my team and I have set up an insectarium to breed sterile sandflies.
1919年，约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯建议一战后欧洲的政治家们摒弃复仇式的爱国主义，通过欧洲一体化来缔造将来的和平环境。	In 1919, John Maynard Keynes told the statesmen of post-World War I Europe to abandon their vindictive patriotism for the sake of building a future of peace based on European integration.
在1998-2008年间被投资并再投资于标普的成分股的资金所产生的真实回报为零：该股票组合所收益的股息正好可以抵消通胀。	Funds invested, and reinvested, in the S&P composite from 1998-2008 have yielded a real return of zero: the dividends earned on the portfolio have been just enough to offset inflation.
在冷战期间，美国能够保护柏林是因为北约联盟和美军进驻使我们的承诺真实可信，如果苏联进攻，美国士兵的生命将处在危险之中。	During the Cold War, the US was able to defend Berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the NATO alliance and the presence of American troops, whose lives would be on the line in the event of a Soviet attack.
虽然经济快速增长提振了许多发达国家的人均收入，但增收状况并不均匀，导致数亿人在没有充分增收的情况下面临更高的粮价。	Although rapid economic growth has boosted per capita incomes in much of the developed world, income gains are not spread evenly, leaving hundreds of millions of people to face higher food prices without sufficient increases in income.
几分钟后，这艘小船倾覆，蕾哈娜·库尔迪（Rihanna Kurdi）和她的两个孩子加里布（Ghalib）和阿兰（Aylan）溺亡。	A few minutes later, the dinghy capsized, and Rihanna Kurdi, together with her two children, Ghalib and Aylan, drowned.
但如今，印度必须接受世贸组织TRIPS协定的约束，据此重新修订其专利法，这在发展中世界造成了普遍的焦虑 — — 可负担药物的全球供给告急。	But India is now bound by the World Trade Organization’s TRIPS agreement, and has revised its patent laws accordingly, causing widespread anxiety in the developing world about the implications for global provision of affordable medicines.
但没有一个主流德国政党 — — 更不用说默克尔自己的政党 — — 会与联邦众议院第三大党德国另类选择党（AfD）联合执政。 AfD是一个极右翼反欧盟政党，它赢得了13%的选票。	But no mainstream German party, let alone Merkel’s, would govern with the third-largest faction in the Bundestag, Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right anti-EU party that garnered 13% of the vote.
在200名最有影响力经济学家的更新率只有25 % — —而前100名只有16 % — —而在这个十年中，主流经济学理论的解释力显然需要大幅增加。	The rate of renewal among the 200 most influential economists was as low as 25% – and just 16% among the top 100 – during a decade in which the explanatory power of prevailing economic theory had been found severely wanting.
监管机构给ISDA的致函要求衍生品行业重写标准合约，以便破产公司的组合不会在递交破产申请后立刻被了结。	The regulators’ letter to the ISDA asked the derivatives industry to rewrite its standard contracts, so that a bankrupt firm’s portfolio is not ripped apart as soon as it files.
但马拉维市的示威表明了一个更加复杂的长期动态，这一动态正在中国已与国家政府达成协议的非洲和拉丁美洲上演。	The Marawi City protests, however, signal a more complex long-term dynamic, one that is playing out in parts of Africa and Latin America where China has made deals with national governments.
但目前正在引发激烈争论的是美国总统唐纳德·特朗普最近对阿帕约的赦免，因为它提出了有关总统赦免权的根本性问题，而赦免权问题从美国诞生之日起就一直是美国决策过程的一部分。	But it is US President Donald Trump’s recent pardon of Arpaio that currently is spurring heated debate, as it raises fundamental questions about the presidential pardon power that has been a part of US policymaking from the country’s birth.
华盛顿 — — 纵观历史，虐待种族、宗教、语言、文化、区域、意识形态、性别或其他领域的少数族裔在世界各地无不对暴力和社会破坏起到推波助澜的效果。	WASHINGTON, DC – Throughout history, mistreatment of minorities – whether ethnic, religious, linguistic, cultural, regional, ideological, sexual, or other – has fueled violence and devastated societies worldwide.
首先，最重要的是，存在“全球储蓄过剩 ” 。 这一概念由美联储现任主席伯南克在2005年的一次演讲中提出。	First and foremost, there is the “global savings glut,” an idea popularized by current Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in a 2005 speech.
首先，进行正式转交的是锡克帝国末代大君杜力普·辛格（Duleep Singh ） ， 当时只有十岁 — — 很有可能根本没得选择。	For starters, the formal handover was conducted by the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, Duleep Singh, who was only ten years old – and most certainly was not given a choice.
因此，从现在开始到下一次法国总统大选到来之前的30多个星期里，今天所做的任何预测都有可能在投票前发生逆转、再发生逆转。	So, in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election, any prediction made today could be reversed, and reversed again, before the vote.
2002年蒙特雷发展金融会议在国外和国内投资、对外债务、国际合作、贸易和系统治理问题上取得了重大突破。	And the 2002 Monterrey FfD conference produced major breakthroughs on foreign and domestic investment, foreign debt, international cooperation, trade, and systemic governance issues.
伦敦—英国退欧日 — — 2019年3月29日，皇家海军不列颠海盗号（HMS Buccaneer Britannia）将起航巡航“英国势力圈 ” 。	LONDON – On Brexit day – March 29, 2019 – the HMS Buccaneer Britannia will set sail in search of the riches of the “Anglosphere.”
但尽管土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安执政比印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪早11年，但他们的个人和职业轨迹的许多特点却使得人们无法抗拒比较。	But, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan rose to power 11 years before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there is much about their personal and professional trajectories that makes comparison irresistible.
但电子邮件问题凸显了民众不喜欢克林顿的某些原因：说得好听一点，她在回答问题时一直对这种毋庸置疑的鲁莽行为持避重就轻的态度。	But the email row has highlighted some of the reasons people don’t like Clinton: To put it charitably, she’s been evasive in her responses to questions about what was undeniably a reckless act.
同样，尽管最新的措施可能会发挥一定作用，比如让低利息导致狂热的中国房地产市场降降温，但从长期来看还是需要解决根本的货币政策缺陷。	Likewise, although the latest measures might have some impact, cooling China’s turbulent property market – which relies on cheap credit – in the long term will require addressing underlying monetary-policy weaknesses.
因此，政府对“西方价值观”的镇压 — — 更不用说无情的互联网战争了 — — 可能促使中国最优秀、最聪明的头脑外流。	As a result, the government’s suppression of “Western values” – not to mention its relentless war on the Internet – is likely to spur an exodus of the country’s best and brightest.
计算机软件或硬件的换代可能会带来更高的能力、效率或绩效，但这些进步的效果至少有一部分被使用者不得不花在学习如何使用上的时间所抵消。	While a new iteration of computer software or hardware may offer more capacity, efficiency, or performance, those advantages are at least partly offset by the time users have to spend learning to use it.
萨科齐认为，并不能因为自由市场允许杠杆存在就认为它一定是好的，投机客的行为有时也会会造成不良后果，此言不差。	Sarkozy is right that leverage is not necessarily good just because the free market allows it, and that speculators occasionally act in a destabilizing way.
所有人都会换尿布，但不是所有人都能以能够塑造神经元参与、刺激和响应婴儿或幼童，拥有契合儿童发育阶段的传授技能的人就更少了。	Anyone can change a diaper, but not everyone can engage, stimulate, and respond to a baby or a toddler in a way that will build neurons, much less impart skills calibrated to the child’s stage of development.
事实上，欧洲央行很快就必须面对一个事实：结构性改革和财政紧缩远不足以成为解决欧洲债务问题的完整方案。	Indeed, the ECB will soon have to confront the fact that structural reforms and fiscal austerity fall far short of being a complete solution to Europe’s debt problems.
事实上令人瞩目的经济增长带来的就是埃及和突尼斯阿拉伯青年不断上升的预期 — — 也随之推动了阿拉伯之春。	Indeed, the rising aspirations of Arab youth in Egypt and Tunisia, the wellspring of the Arab Spring, followed impressive economic growth that had failed to trickle down.
但是，虽然没有适当的防卫预算的替代品，我们可以以目前的开支水平取得更多的物资，特别是通过一个更聪明的军事采办方法来达到这一点。	But, while there is no substitute for appropriate defense budgets, we could get more from current spending levels, especially through a smarter approach to defense acquisition.
第三个案件则重新揭示了一位政治家在几十年前对巴基斯坦“三驾马车 ” — —总统，总理以及武装部队总参���长 — — 的控诉。	The third case opened an old complaint lodged by a politician decades ago against the “troika” – composed of the president, the prime minister, and the chief of army staff – that then governed Pakistan.
而那些将原因单纯归咎于某种理念的解释也是站不住脚的，须知作为一个群体，无论是那些将市场效率视为笑话的行为经济学家；还是不相信自由市场的发展经济学家，都没能预测到这场危机。	But there is a better reason to be skeptical of explanations relying on ideology. As a group, neither behavioral economists, who think that market efficiency is a joke, nor progressive economists, who distrust free markets, predicted the crisis.
最为可能的解释是二者兼而有之，因为他和布什都在实施共同的“饿死牲畜”的政治战略，也就是利用减税来降低财政收入，从而迫使公营部门减小规模。	The most likely explanation is a combination of the two, for he and Bush were pursuing the same “starve the beast” political strategy, which calls for tax cuts to be used to reduce revenues, thereby forcing the public sector to be downsized.
尽管如此，我们的发现给出了迈向防止银行资本流失的简单的第一步：禁止存在资本短缺的银行发放红利（包括员工奖金等内部红利 ） 。	Nonetheless, our findings suggest a simple first step toward preventing bank capital erosion: stop banks with capital shortfalls from paying dividends (including internal dividends such as employee bonuses).
而在上台还不到100天的时候，他为了在叙利亚被杀害的人发布了一道命令，同时大谈特谈“你能见到的最美妙的巧克力蛋糕 ” 。	And, not even 100 days into his presidency, he had issued an order for people to be killed in Syria while gushing about “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake you’ve ever seen.”
保守党的成功做成并且做得相当聪明的是说服英格兰人民他们只是在“收拾工党的烂摊子 ” ， 并且，要不是紧缩，英国将“是另一个希腊 ” — —而这正是弗格森的观点。	What the Conservatives did succeed in doing, and doing brilliantly, was to persuade English people that they were only “cleaning up Labour’s mess,” and that, but for austerity, Britain would have “gone the way of Greece” – exactly Ferguson’s view.
公决措辞确定后举行的民调 （ “ 苏格兰是否应当成为独立国家 ？ ” ）显示“赞成独立”的一方不大可能占据明显多数。	Opinion polls taken since the wording of the referendum (“Should Scotland be an independent country?”) was announced indicate that the “yes” side is unlikely to gain a clear majority.
���这又能让我们在迈向全面禁止全球核试验 — — 不管是地面、海底、外太空还是地下 — — 的道路上更进一步。	That would bring us closer to a global ban on nuclear tests in any environment – the atmosphere, undersea, in outer space, or underground.
希腊官员在考虑选项时最好记住，主权债务违约的方式也分好坏 — — 特别是如果渴望尽快重塑国家信誉的话。	As Greek officials consider their options, they would do well to bear in mind that there are better and worse ways to default on sovereign debt – especially given countries’ desire to reestablish their creditworthiness as soon as possible.
依我来看，这至少是由于对1930年和2000年的记忆占据了投资者头脑中过大的位置。 当时，股票业绩极差。	In my opinion, at least, this is partly because the memory of years like 1930 and 2000, when stocks performed very badly, occupies too large a place in investors’ minds.
但埃尔多安的第三项决策彻底葬送了这种可能性：埃尔多安主动选择与法土拉·葛兰决裂，这位外籍传教士颇具影响力的追随者 — — 也就是所谓的服务（Hizmet）运动 — — 多年以来一直是埃尔多安最重要的同盟军。	But a third decision ruled that out: Erdoğan chose to break with Fethullah Gülen, the expatriate cleric whose influential followers – the so-called Hizmet movement – had for many years been among Erdoğan’s most important allies.
众多演员在布赖恩·伊诺、埃尔维斯·科斯特洛、凡妮莎·帕拉迪丝、罗杰·沃特斯及其他明星的领导下公开表达了他们不清楚是否要出现在“巴勒斯坦被占领区 ” 。	And then there are the many performers who – following the lead of Brian Eno, Elvis Costello, Vanessa Paradis, Roger Waters, and others – wonder out loud whether or not to appear in “occupied Palestine.”
但是，如果欧盟允许其对黎巴嫩的承诺变成美国加剧如今的什叶派和逊尼派分裂、从而孤立伊朗的呼之欲出的战略的一部分，那么，其声誉就会恶化。	But the Union could see its reputation worsen if it allows its commitment to Lebanon to become part of the emerging US strategy of isolating Iran by hardening today’s regional Sunni-Shia divisions.
除非中国领导人改革增长战略以刺激技术进步和制度转型，否则高收入将仍是这个世界第二大经济体和第一大人口国可望而不可及的成就。	Unless China’s leaders upgrade the country’s growth strategy to stimulate technological progress and structural transformation, high-income status will continue to elude the world’s second-largest economy and most populous country.
但通过更仔细的解读可以发现，两位作者保留了对美联储的最严厉的批评 — — 没能在1930年上半年实施购买证券的联合计划以防止银行倒闭。	But a close reading reveals that the authors reserve their most scathing criticism for the Fed’s failure to initiate a concerted program of security purchases in the first half of 1930 in order to prevent those bank failures.
教育将继续停滞不前，因宗族、部落和宗教的不同而彼此割裂的阿拉伯社会将经历越来越多的冤冤相报和暴力相向。	Education would continue to stagnate, and Arab societies, which are divided across sectarian, tribal, and regional lines, would experience rising levels of retribution and violence.
本来凭借其在议会中无法撼动的绝对多数，它可以进行连贯的供应学派的改革，即使在开始阶段存在面临抵制的风险。	With an unassailable parliamentary majority, it could have undertaken coherent supply-side reforms, even at the risk of some initial unpopularity.
随着公平且稳固的以色列—巴勒斯坦和平关系的确立，叙利亚也许不得不被迫撤走其在黎巴嫩的驻军，并减少对黎巴嫩政治的干预。	With a just and stable Israeli-Palestinian peace, Syria might be forced not only to withdraw its troops, but also to lessen its interference in Lebanese politics.
领导人还试图通过拒绝接触可能持批评态度的媒体组织来控制媒体叙事，美国就是如此，而在总统马杜罗治下危机重重的委内瑞拉做得更加激进。	Leaders may also try to control the narrative by denying access to potentially critical media organizations, as has occurred in the US and, more aggressively, in crisis-ridden Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro.
更重要的是，即使美国可以利用它的实力在双边谈判环境中确保更有利的条件，但这样带来的收益未必能多于规模更大的协定。	More important, even if the US can use its weight to secure more favorable provisions in a bilateral negotiating context, the benefits do not necessarily outweigh those of larger-scale agreements.
但是，鉴于我们面临巨大的全球性压力、包括收入差异悬殊以及巨大的环境破坏，我们必需为我们的问题找到新的技术解决方案。	Yet, given the enormous global pressures that we face, including vastly unequal incomes and massive environmental damage, we must find new technological solutions to our problems.
铲除罂粟种植在阿富汗永远不会成功，因为它摧毁的是唯一一种能在南方的恶劣气候中生长的作物—而它又是上百万人的主要收入来源。	Eradication will never be successful in Afghanistan, because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south’s harsh climate – and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people.
这种局势的危害就是开国先贤采取第二修正案的原因。 第二修正案意味着把维持国内治安的责任局限在民兵身上：即国民警卫队和和民警，而民兵是向民众负责的。	“The danger of that situation is why the Founders adopted the Second Amendment, which is meant to restrict domestic policing to militia – the National Guard and civilian police – that are answerable to the people.
相反意大利可能会寻求实现一个零核风险环境，因为该国本身并不生产核电，电都是从其国土附近100英里内的各国核电站（其中法国6座，斯洛文尼亚和瑞士各一座）买来的。	Italy, on the other hand, might wish for a zero-nuclear risk environment, as it does not produce electricity from nuclear power but is surrounded (within about 100 miles) by one Slovene, one Swiss, and six French nuclear-power plants.
同样毋庸置疑的是巴勒斯坦人民做出了民主的选择，而这一选择又必然意味着与以色列通过谈判达成和平的抉择。	Nor is there any doubt that the Palestinian people made a choice for democracy, which entails a choice for a negotiated peace with Israel.
但随着中国实力不断增长并重新争取其在亚洲和世界本来拥有的历史地位，它还会等多久才提出重塑国际规则的要求？	But, as China grows stronger and reclaims what it believes to be its historic position in Asia and the world, how long will it wait to insist on reshaping the international rules?
事实上，过去一百年来，工业发展的历史大多可以归结为教育程度不断提高的劳动力与降低他们的技能要求的新技术之间的竞争。	Indeed, much of the story of industrial development over the last century can be seen in terms of competition between an increasingly educated workforce and new technology that would dispense with their skills.
2010年的核不扩散会议将紧急呼吁这个问题的重要性。 先期的筹备委员会将于今年5月份在纽��碰头，前期的工作也将开展起来。	The 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference calls for an urgent formulation of priorities.
尽管体重指数正常，但代谢肥胖群体 — — 可能在正常体重群体中占比高达24 % — —可能对胰岛素具有耐药性，同时罹患心脏代谢疾病的风险也增大。	Despite their normal BMI, metabolically obese individuals – who may comprise as much as 24% of a normal-weight population – may be insulin-resistant and suffer increased cardio-metabolic risks.
失业率减少的原因很简单，当然不是由于商业信心恢复，而是那场该死的战争本身：大量的人员或是被直接卷入战争，或是为战争相关产业服务。	It was because of a nasty war, plain and simple, with people drafted into fighting, or into industries supplying the war effort.
法国相信，展现胜任的军力是实力的表现 — — 对于这一看法，绝大部分欧洲国家都是不认同的，它们对战争持有集体厌恶。	It believes that operational military capability is a condition of power – a view that is not shared by the overwhelming majority of European states, which continue to display a collective aversion to war.
更糟糕的是，银行家现在踌躇满志地坐在自己的座位上，赚着大多数工人一辈子都不敢想的奖金，而努力学习、循规蹈矩的年轻人却面临着失业的前景。	Worse, the bankers are now back at their desks, earning bonuses that amount to more than most workers hope to earn in a lifetime, while young people who studied hard and played by the rules see no prospects for fulfilling employment.
尽管这一缺口已从2006年占GDP的5.8%的最高峰下降到2014年的占GDP的2.4 % ， 但仍意味着美国要想增长就必须严重依赖外国储蓄盈余。	While this shortfall has narrowed from a peak of 5.8% of GDP in 2006 to 2.4% in 2014, it still leaves the US heavily dependent on surplus foreign savings in order to grow.
但是，就我所听到的争论而言，我不得不疑惑，如此之多��智力和感情聚焦于如此之小的细枝末节 — — “婚姻”这个词而不是其含义，这也算是人类历史上的奇谈了吧。	But, as I have sat and listened to the debate, I cannot help wondering what a break it is in human history for so much intellect and feeling to be focused on such a small matter as the state’s withholding of a word, marriage, but not its substance.
奥巴马稳定银行体系的措施也还算成功，尽管它留下了许多遗憾：我原本希望，资本注入的力度能够更大一些，总统能够运用权力，炒掉那些应该为金融危机的爆发负首要责任的金融高管。	I would have preferred bigger capital injections. I would have liked to see his administration use its leverage to replace the management responsible for creating the financial mess in the first place.
简言之，今日亚洲面临的关键挑战是维持经济增长 — — 以有所降低但仍令人羡慕的速度，并改善增长质量。	In short, the key challenges facing Asia today are to sustain economic growth – at lower, but still enviable, rates – and to improve its quality.
把这两种情况放在一起考虑，你就会发现欧盟与美国的贸易谈判会的阻碍在哪里 — — 它放弃了原本雄心勃勃（尽管并非完全不切实际）用来实现这一大计的两年时间表。	Put the two together and you get a barrier to EU-US trade negotiations – one that renders ambitious (though not entirely unrealistic) the two-year timeline that has been set for completing the deal.
除了威胁到新兴市场的稳定，突然而剧烈的美元升值 — — 特别是其所造成的贸易竞争力的损失 — — 有可能让已经十分微妙的贸易谈判变得更加复杂。	Beyond challenging emerging markets’ stability, a sudden and sharp appreciation of the US dollar – and, specifically, the losses in trade competitiveness that it causes – threatens to complicate already-delicate trade negotiations.
如此多的电影选择彻底颠覆既定的国家叙事方式，暗示人们不再愿意盲目接受由精英们出于其自身的目的而塑造出来的历史。	The many movies that critically revise settled national narratives suggest that people are no longer willing to accept history that has been crafted by elites for their own purposes.
据传言，Daniel Barenboim离开芝加哥交响乐团在一定程度上就是因为不满该团对他的筹款要求。	Daniel Barenboim is rumored to have left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands that were being made of him.
想和阿萨德合作的魔法师的学徒似乎没有认识到一旦时机来临，他们极有可能很难与阿萨德拉开距离，因为这个曾经的盟友在分享胜利果实的时刻丝毫不会害羞。	What the sorcerer’s apprentices who want to work with Assad ignore is that they would most likely have a great deal of trouble, when the time comes, distancing themselves from an ally who would not be shy about claiming his share of the victory.
但今天，约90%的美国育种母猪¾也就是人类饲养和宰杀后制成鲜肉、咸肉和火腿的肉用猪的母亲¾一生绝大多数时间都是在只有2英尺乘7英尺（0.6米乘2.2米）的铁笼中渡过的。	Today, however, about 90% of US breeding sows – the mothers of the pigs that are raised and killed for pork, bacon, and ham – spend most of their lives locked in cages that measure about two feet by seven feet (0.6 meters by 2.2 meters).
黎以交战进入第四个星期时，埃及政权当然的继承人贾迈勒·穆巴拉克(Gamal Mubarak)也站到了黎巴嫩一边，率领70人的代表团访问贝鲁特。	Egypt’s heir apparent Gamal Mubarak followed suit in the fourth week of the fighting by heading a 70-member delegation on a solidarity visit to Beirut.
奥朗德向全世界宣布能够熟练掌握全球事务通用语言，从而给自己披上了现代政治家的外衣，同时，他又暗示法国将尽力维持自己在国际社会中的影响力。	In proclaiming his mastery of the lingua franca of global affairs, Hollande was asserting himself as a modern statesman, while also suggesting that France will remain as influential as possible on the international scene.
面对这些力量强大但喜欢突然行事的德国人，密特朗这次“出使”的动机其实是想判定究竟可以（或应该）采取何种预防措施来应对他们的未来动向。	The motive of Mitterrand’s “mission” was to determine what precautions could or should be taken against the potential vagaries of this powerful but unpredictable people.
此外，英国退出欧盟的决定所带来的主要问题 — — 其他国家是否会效仿，以及，事实上欧盟自身还有没有未来 — — 也远未解决。	Moreover, the main questions raised by Britain’s decision to leave – whether other countries will follow and, indeed, whether the EU itself has a future – remain far from resolved.
借助一系列手段来评估职业针对电脑化的受影响程度，最近一项覆盖702种职业的研究发现其中近一半的美国劳动者都面临着风险。	Using a variety of measures to assess the susceptibility of jobs to computerization, a recent study of 702 occupations finds that nearly half of total US employment is at risk.
斯坦福 — — 1961年的一天，一位名叫丹尼尔·埃尔斯伯格的美国经济学家偶然发现了一篇与世界末日有关的论文。	STANFORD – One day in 1961, an American economist named Daniel Ellsberg stumbled across a piece of paper with apocalyptic implications.
但如今，它面临着严峻的考验：在73个Gavi延长支持的国家中，有三分之一要么正处于过渡期，要么刚刚结束过渡期。	But it is now being put to a stern test: one-third of the 73 countries to which Gavi extends support are either in the midst of the transition process or have just completed it.
也许好不令人奇怪的是，妇女 — — 包括记者和政治活跃分子 — — 成为印度人民党喷子所钟爱的目标，他们不但质疑她们的道德、污蔑她们的长相，还常常发出强奸威胁。	Perhaps unsurprisingly, women – including journalists and political activists – are favorite targets of the BJP’s trolls, who not only question their morals and disparage their looks, but routinely issue rape threats.
事实上，如今沙特贵族-平民比例大约为1:1000（而英国的比例为1:500万 ） ， 如何治理王子特权和收入已经成为一项挑战，而王子们对职位的要求也越来越高。	Indeed, with the ratio of royals to commoners now at one to a thousand (compared to one to five million in the United Kingdom), the challenge of managing princely privileges, salaries, and demand for jobs has never been more intense.
费城—印度和中国军队在多克拉（Doka La，不丹、中国和印度三国交界处）的对峙已经持续了近一个月，是两军自1962年以来维持时间最长的僵持。	PHILADELPHIA – Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a standoff in Doka La – where the borders of Bhutan, China and India meet – for almost a month now, the longest such impasse between the two armies since 1962.
类似地，默克尔的膝跳反射式决定 — — 如日本福岛事故不出几个月就宣布德国逐步退出核电，以及允许难民从安全的第三国进入德国等 — — 也将无法推行。	Likewise, kneejerk decisions by Merkel – such as her move to phase out nuclear power within a few months of the Fukushima accident in Japan, or to allow refugees to enter Germany from safe third countries – will now be impossible.
但是欧洲独立安全和防务政策得以全面落实后就不一定无条件地追随美国，特别是如果美国的政策继续像在伊拉克问题上那样偏离国际法准则。	But the ESDP, once fully developed, will not necessarily follow America’s lead unconditionally, especially if American policy continues to deviate from the norm of international law, as in Iraq.
一个极具说服力的观点认为，中国的贬值导致泰国、韩国、印度尼西亚、马来西亚和菲律宾竞争力下降，后几个国家货币都盯住（或准盯住）美元。	It has been persuasively argued that the Chinese devaluation resulted in a loss of competitiveness for Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, which had pegged (or semi-pegged) their currencies to the US dollar.
足球场上的行为准则 — — 我们期待球员在独立裁判当场执行明确规则的情况下尽全力争胜 — — 从根本上讲也是我们希望场下管理机构能够做到的。	The code of conduct on the field – where we expect players to give their all under clear rules that are swiftly enforced by independent referees – is fundamentally the same as what we expect from governing bodies off the field.
公民与国家之间的契约，即国家经济的基石，无法在欧洲层面复制，因为不存在可以与之达成这个协议的欧洲国。	And the contract between citizens and states on which national economies depend cannot be reproduced at the European level, because there is no European state with which to conclude the deal.
继2013年爆发针对2014年世界杯花费太多问题的骚乱后，示威活动一直持续到6月份，甚至世界杯举办期间都没有停息。	Following the 2013 riots over the amount of money being spent on the 2014 soccer World Cup, protests continued up to, and even during, the tournament in June.
哥伦比亚需要委内瑞拉总统马杜罗的合作维持与FARC游击队的谈判；而智利新总统巴切莱特的软肋一直是查韦斯主义及其作态。	Colombia needs President Nicolás Maduro’s cooperation to sustain negotiations with the FARC guerrillas; the new Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, has always had a soft spot for Chavismo and its antics.
此外，希腊的社会稳定已经无法维持；希腊是个小国，但它的全面崩溃可能对其他地区造成极严重的消极金融和心理效应。	The situation in Greece, moreover, has become socially unsustainable; Greece is small, but a total collapse there could have very negative financial and psychological effects elsewhere.
在饮食和营养领域有一个根本性的争论，即卡路里斗士和具体饮食方法之争 — — 不管是低热量派、低碳水化合物派还是“订购我的昂贵配方餐”派。	In the field of diet and nutrition, there is a fundamental debate between calorie counters and proponents of specific diets, whether low-fat, low-carbohydrate, or buy-my-line-of-expensive-formulated-products.
事实证明国际社会无法终结那些不断制造出难民的危机，但生物医学工程师至少可以确保这些人能得到他们所需的护理。	The international community has proved incapable of ending the crises that are currently sending refugees in search of safety. But biomedical engineers can at least ensure that they receive the care they need.
在最根本的层面上，英国在欧盟的利益集中在后者是一个超强自由能贸易区，并能带来金融服务“通用护照 ” 。	At the most fundamental level, Britain’s interest in the EU has centered on its status as a kind of supercharged free-trade area and an enabler of a “common passport” for financial services.

两位约旦前首相阿卜杜勒·萨拉姆·马贾利和塔希尔·马斯里，还有侯赛因国王的前顾问阿德南·阿布奥德都图谋推动一个约旦-巴勒斯坦合并解决方案。	Jordanians of the caliber of Former Prime Ministers Abdelsalam Al-Majali and Taher al-Masri, as well as a former adviser of King Hussein, Adnan Abu-Odeh, have been advancing schemes for a Jordanian-Palestinian solution.
一个典型的国家，随着它日益富裕、教育程度日增、政治日益开放，对民主的支持和对公民参与的准备也会增加，而对威权的副总和对父权价值的支持则会降低。	As a typical country becomes richer, more educated, and more politically open, support for democracy and readiness for civic engagement rise, and obedience to authority and support for patriarchal values fall.
事实上，从某种程度而言，欧文·克里斯托、诺曼·波德霍雷茨和老一辈的新保守主义政治家，当他们还是年轻的托洛茨基主义者时就被他们反对的共产主义教条所限制。	Indeed, in a certain sense, Irving Kristol, Norman Podhoretz, and other neo-conservative elder statesmen remain defined by the communist dogmatism they sought to oppose when they were youthful Trotskyists.
与伊朗的协议不但可以巩固核不扩散条约，还可以开辟一条谅解伊朗之路，这是任何控制和阻止暴力席卷西亚的广义外交行动的关键。	As it is, not only will an agreement add cement to the NPT; it could also open the way to the sort of understanding with Iran that is essential to any broad diplomatic moves to control and halt the violence sweeping across western Asia.
与美国不同 — — 美国建立在反对英国殖民主义的政治目标基础上，这铸造了共同的国民身份 — — 加入欧盟的诸国只是为了寻求进一步躲避大陆战乱。	Unlike the US, which was founded on a political cause – opposition to British colonialism – that forged a common national identity, countries joining the European Union sought simply to avoid further warfare on the continent.
可惜，卢克准备用机器人Nexus替换肯，它可以更长时间、更安全、全天候地操作收割机，而不用午歇、假期和病假补贴。	Alas, Luke is about to replace Ken with Nexus, a robot that can operate the harvester longer, more safely, in any weather, and without lunch breaks, holidays, or sick pay.
孟买 — — 私有和公共部门的去杠杆化在美国经济持续疲软的背景下齐头并进，已经导致失业率居高不下和经济增长低于预期。	MUMBAI – The ongoing weakness of America’s economy – where deleveraging in the private and public sectors continues apace – has led to stubbornly high unemployment and sub-par growth.
不管是什么计划，公民肯定会经受一些痛苦，与此同时，市场必须认为这些痛苦在政治上是可接受的，至少要比替代方案好。	While any plan will involve pain for citizens, the markets must deem the pain politically tolerable, at least relative to the alternatives.
与此同时，尽管经济复苏的曙光隐约初现，但全球实际工资的增速在继2008年大幅放缓之后，预期将在2009年进一步下滑。	In this climate, globalization has come under heavy criticism, including from leaders of developing countries that could strongly benefit from it.
我的公司诺华所研发的一种新肺癌药物只对发生了一种特殊基因突变的非小细胞（non-small-cell）肺癌患者有效。	A new lung cancer drug developed by my company, Novartis, is effective only in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who have a particular genetic mutation.
伊斯坦布尔—2009年初，塔吉克斯坦卡特隆省（Khatlon）局部发生山体滑坡灾难，巴尔德朱万村（Baldzhuvan）做得准备工作比较充分。	ISTANBUL – When landslides devastated parts of Tajikistan’s Khatlon province in early 2009, the village of Baldzhuvan was better prepared than most.
目前它尚没有能力建立 — — 更不用说监督 — — 新的地区秩序，原因很简单：克里姆林宫在这里缺乏真正的盟友。	It is not currently capable of helping to establish – much less oversee – a new regional order, for a simple reason: the Kremlin lacks true allies there.
按萨默斯的说法，造成这一局面的可能原因有两个：来自亚洲的储蓄过剩以及由IT造成的资本品相对价格的长期下跌降低了投资相对储蓄的需求。	There are, according to Summers, two possible reasons for this: a saving glut coming from Asia or a long-term IT-induced decline in the relative price of capital goods that has reduced needed investment relative to saving.
这些年轻活动家也许尚未在Twitter或Facebook上热门起来，甚至在自己的国家中也没有什么名气，但对他们的事业的支持正在快速扩大。	These young activists may not yet be trending on Twitter or Facebook, or even be household names in their own countries, but support for their cause is growing fast.
灾难的起因是斯大林深信富农拒不将藏匿的粮食交给苏维埃政府，他以此为依据征用种粮，并认为这样做就会迫使富农用藏匿的粮食来做种子。	The catastrophe was unleashed when Stalin, convinced that the kulaks were hiding grain from the Soviet state, requisitioned the seed grain, believing that this would force the kulaks to use the hidden grain as seed.
但政府应该直接提高低技能劳动力的价格，这样的建议可能令人倒吸一口凉气，也会让人小声议论我一定是疯了。	Yet the suggestion that governments should act directly to raise the price of lower-skilled labor is likely to be met with sharp intakes of breath and sotto voce comments that I must be mad.
我们新的民主联盟党解放者/占领者在宣布胜利后所做的第一件事就是修建一座库尔德工人党被监禁领袖阿卜杜拉·奥贾兰的巨型雕像。	One of the first things that our new PYD liberators/occupiers did after declaring victory was to display their own foreign identity by installing a huge portrait of the PKK’s jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
事实上 ， “ 民族主义”反对派只是众多负责保护小片领土的派系的松散组合 ， “ 自由叙利亚军 ” （ Free Syrian Army）则无异于幻想。	"Indeed, the “nationalist"" opposition is merely an assortment of factions responsible for protecting small territories, and the “Free Syrian Army"" is little more than a fantasy."
但一年获得1,000多亿美元又不会影响到美国消费者和生产者，这样的前景将促使国会推进总体计划中的这一部分。	But the prospect of raising more than $100 billion a year without hurting US consumers or producers will drive Congress to move forward with this feature of the overall plan.
20世纪90年代末，当数字技术开始让常规就业岗位自动化和脱媒化时，通往财富和收入不平等的变化更是如同快马加鞭。	In the late 1990s, when digital technologies began to automate and disintermediate more routine jobs, the shift toward higher wealth and income inequality became turbocharged.
就像硅谷创业计划一样，该项目联合学术界、人才济济的本地企业和跨国公司携手完成共同的目标 — — 具体地讲就是全世界最大射电望远镜的建造。	Like Silicon Valley-based initiatives, the project unites academia, talent-rich local companies, and multinationals behind a common goal – in this case, to build the world’s largest radio telescope.
但贸易自由化的政治学 — — 即各国怎样接受自由贸易 — — 要复杂得多，这主要是因为受到冲击的特殊利益集团从中作梗。	But the politics of trade liberalization – that is, the way in which countries proceed to accept free trade – is much more complex, largely because of those particular groups it hurts.
《福布斯》杂志报道“数百名以色列和巴勒斯坦人正在成为创业企业中实实在在的同事和商业伙伴，这些企业正逐渐改变巴勒斯坦、至少是西岸经济 。 ”	Forbes magazine reports that “hundreds of Israeli[s] and Palestinians are becoming actual business partners and colleagues in startups that are slowly transforming the Palestinian economy, at least in the West Bank.”
他们承认不平等性是一个问题，并且在原则上他们支持提供高质量教育和医疗服务的政府政策，但他们不信任政客或官僚。	They recognize inequality as a problem, and in principle they support government policies that provide high-quality education and health-care services, but they do not trust politicians or bureaucrats.
取而代之，它很可能支持表面的政治改革，包括制订一部新的法律正式地把军队领导人的角色与国家元首的角色分离开。	Instead, they will most likely support cosmetic political reforms, including a new law that formally separates the roles of army commander and head of state.

等到海岸警卫队和印度海军将足够的船只和飞机调往受灾地区，距离奥基掀翻大量渔船已经过去整整24小时了。	By the time the Coast Guard and the Indian Navy had brought enough ships and planes to the affected area, a full 24 hours had passed since Ockhi capsized numerous fishing boats.
本周在缅甸发生的新一轮针对中国矿业投资的示威确认了这一趋势，而中国领导要么认为这一无关紧要，要么认为这与其恃强凌弱的行为没有什么关系。	Renewed protests over China’s mining investments in Myanmar this week confirmed this trend, one that China’s leaders seem either to dismiss as trivial, or to regard as somehow unrelated to their bullying.
但这些方法本身并非没有问题，包括狭隘主义以及竞选频率过大所导致的政客受制于资助其竞选活动的特殊利益集团而非选民。	But these solutions are not without their own problems, including parochialism and the risk that the frequency of elections will make politicians beholden not to voters, but to the special interests that finance their campaigns.
我们不能忘记地区紧张局势的起源，被称为“阿拉伯之春”的这起事件其根源恰恰在于青年人缺乏实现其梦想和抱负的机会。	We do not forget that the genesis of the tension in our region, the events dubbed the “Arab Spring,” was squarely rooted in the lack of opportunities for young people to achieve their dreams and ambitions.
在王国正式谴责真主党之后，沙特国家呼吁其官方瓦哈比教士们发布伊斯兰法令，谴责真主党是什叶派离经叛道之徒和异教徒。	Following the Kingdom’s official denunciation of Hezbollah, the Saudi state called on its official Wahhabi clerics to issue fatwas condemning Hezbollah as Shiite deviants and heretics.
这种模式还包括政府开支的过度扩张，导致公务员薪资膨胀，基础设施建设大干快上，一旦油价下跌，两者都将不可持续。	The pattern also includes an exuberant expansion of government spending, which can result in bloated public payrolls and large infrastructure projects, both of which are found to be unsustainable when oil prices fall.
虽然德国投资顺差过大有损国内生产率和经济增长，但它并非增长乏力、失业率高企、竞争力低下和欧洲其他国家各项经济问题的主要负责人。	While Germany has a large investment gap that hurts domestic productivity and growth, it is not the main culprit behind tepid growth, high unemployment, low competitiveness, and other economic ills elsewhere in Europe.
1939年最后时刻英国允许约10，000名犹太儿童前来英国，但前提是他们在当地要有人抚养，并且离开自己的父母。	Britain allowed about 10,000 Jewish children to come in 1939, at the very last minute, but only if they had local sponsors and left their parents behind.

布鲁塞尔现今是一个与华盛顿类似的政府所在地，即便它也是一个欧盟27个成员国间错综复杂的谈判在磕绊中缓慢进展的地方。	Brussels is nowadays a government town akin to Washington, D.C, even if it is also a place where complex negotiations among the Union’s 27 members grind forward only slowly.
两年前内贾德当选总统，人们寄予厚望。 他保证“把石油价格下降到每个伊朗家庭都能承受的水平 ” ， 而且要打击腐败。	Ahmedinejad’s election two years ago came with great expectations, with the new president pledging to “bring oil prices to the dining table of all households in Iran,” and to crack down on corruption.

2013年，巴勒斯坦政策和调查中心进行的民调显示，55%的巴勒斯坦人支持约旦选项 — — 比五年前增加了10 % 。	In 2013, according to polls conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, 55% of Palestinians supported the Jordanian option – a 10% increase from five years earlier.

如果他们认为它们有可能生活在受漏油影响的社区，他们就会就会希望采取鲁棒而非最低限度的安全标准，也不会寻求绕过法规。	If they believed that they might live in a community affected by an oil spill, they would want robust, not minimal, environmental safety standards, and they would not seek to circumvent the rules.
更有问题的是，以色列在加沙的行动很可能助长了其面对恐怖袭击的脆弱性，因为报复行动不仅助长了对以色列的仇恨，还显示内塔尼亚胡政府很有可能因为采取过激反应而名誉扫地。	More problematic, Israel’s actions in Gaza probably increased its vulnerability to terrorist attacks, not only by fueling animosity toward Israel, but also by suggesting that Netanyahu’s government will most likely discredit itself with its response.
这不但是在任美国总统首次访问1945年毁于美国核弹的广岛；也吸引了人们对奥巴马在核不扩散问题上的记录的关注。	Not only did it mark the first visit by a sitting US president to that city, which was destroyed by an American nuclear bomb in 1945; it also drew attention to Obama’s record on non-proliferation.

但监督委员所提出的新财政计划和COFINA协议将浪费掉宝贵的时间，导致波多黎各长达十年的挣扎将继续并变得更加糟糕。	But by pursuing its new fiscal plan and the COFINA deal, the oversight board has squandered valuable time, ensuring that Puerto Rico’s decade-long struggle will both continue and grow worse.
这场所谓的“大稳定”令许多政策制定者产生了某些错误的安全感，高估了自己管理经济和处理金融危机的能力。	The so-called “Great Moderation” lulled many policymakers into a false sense of security about their ability to manage the economy and deal with financial crises.
它应该是一家起催化作用的贷款机构，其对欧元区计划的残余应该是锦上添花而非雪中送炭，这样才有不同意和退出的可能性。	It should become a catalytic lender whose participation in eurozone programs remains desirable but not indispensable – giving it the possibility to disagree and walk away.
就连全世界最富有的国家美国也竭力落实针对某些最重要社会机构的急迫的改革措施 — — 其中包括美国的医疗和教育体系。	Even the world’s richest nation, the United States, struggles to implement much needed reforms for some of its most important social institutions – including its health and education systems.
尽管其前无古人的非常规政策立场招来了颇多不无道理的质疑，但美联储仍准备在经济疲软时采取更加积极的手段。	Despite legitimate questions about the effectiveness of its unconventional and ever-experimental policy stance, the Fed appears willing to be even more activist if the economy weakens.
IMF在二战后国际秩序的重要特征，其成立初衷是作为一个全球保险机制，而不是被用来满足当代外交利益的工具。	The IMF was a critical feature of the post-WWII international order, intended to serve as a universal insurance mechanism – not one that could be harnessed to advance contemporary diplomatic interests.
普京领导的俄罗斯还不遗余力，按照美国特别检察官罗伯特·穆勒的话讲，实施“以干预美国政治和选举进程为目的的欺诈和欺骗，其中也包括2016年举行的美国总统大选活动 。 ”	Putin’s Russia also went to great lengths, in the words of US Special Counsel Robert Mueller, to carry out “fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the US political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.”
我与文森特·莱因哈特（Vincent Reinhart）和克里斯托弗·特雷贝施（Christoph Trebesch）的新研究表明，国际资本流周期的波峰和波谷非常危险，违约总是在资本流入潮结束后大量涌现。	As my recent work with Vincent Reinhart and Christoph Trebesch reveals, peaks and troughs in the international capital-flow cycle are especially dangerous, with defaults proliferating at the end of a capital-inflow bonanza.
而东京都知事石原慎太郎最近呼吁日本政府从日本“私人”土地所有者手中“买下”这些岛屿的行为就可以在这一背景下得到解释。	Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara’s recent call for Japan’s government to “purchase” the islands from “private” Japanese owners can be explained in this context.
反对增税者应该看到，由于这类开源实际上是政府支出削减，因此并不会产生增加边际税率所能导致的负面激励效应。	Opponents of tax increases should see that, because such revenue-raising is really cutting government spending, it does not imply the adverse incentive effects of raising marginal tax rates.
既是出于必要，也是出于选择，中国开始变得以自我为中心的“后责任 ” （ post-responsible）力量。	By necessity, but also by choice, China has since become a self-centered, “post-responsible” power.
总体生育率（每位妇女生孩子的数量）仅2.14，位居世界最低行列，也远远低于不需要移民就可以维持人口规模的水平2.1。	The total fertility rate (the number of children per woman), at 1.24, is one of the lowest in the world, and well below the level – 2.1 children per woman – needed to sustain a population without immigration.
在短期内，美国恢复对世界秩序不可或缺的传统外交政策或许会因为其中蕴含可预测性更强的地缘政治环境而减少危机爆发的可能。	In the short term, the resumption of conventional foreign policy by the US – which remains indispensible to the world order – could reduce the chance of crisis, because it implies a more predictable geopolitical environment.
比如说，当公共采购丑闻频发，或自然资源使用费在征收时即被盗用，抑或私营部门被一小撮朋党垄断时，公众就无法实现他们的潜力。	When, say, public-procurement fraud is rampant, or royalties for natural resources are stolen at the source, or the private sector is monopolized by a narrow network of cronies, populations are unable to realize their potential.
有可能中国马上会回归大规模经常项目盈余 — — 必须足以满足美国的融资需求，还要给世界其他部分留出足够的份额。	It is likely that China will soon return to running very large current-account surpluses – potentially large enough to fund the US, with plenty left over for the rest of the world.
在这样的背景下，市场对美国增长保持乐观可能会导致比以往更严重的贸易及资本流动失衡，冲击并动摇国际货币体系。	In this context, market optimism about US growth could lead to ever-larger imbalances and possibly disrupt the international monetary system.
科克伦并没有为这个理论辩护，他承认“资产价格比未来预期的合理现金流走得要远 ” 。 不幸的是 ， “ 目前并没有特别好的理论出现 。 ”	And the one thing we do know is that however badly asset markets behave, government control “has always been much worse.”
通过对欧洲问题的积极参与，我们可以向外界表明英国不仅是英美特殊关系中的一方、不仅是北约联盟的二十八分之一、更远远不仅是不断发展的欧盟当中的一个成员国。	Through active engagement with Europe, we can show that we are more than one half of a special relationship with America, more than one twenty-eighth of the NATO alliance, and much more than just one member of an ever-growing EU.
恰恰相反，布什应该制定一个两年计划，在美军撤离前，给予伊拉克政府尽可能充分的施展机会，同时还要强调伊拉克在美军撤离之后必须对自身的安全和政治拯救负责。	Instead, Bush should plan on a two-year window to give the Iraqi government as strong a chance as possible before the Americans leave, while emphasizing that Iraqis will thereafter be responsible for their own security and political salvation.
但不管你属于何种基因型，你对食物的选择，自身的运动习惯，如何减压以及和朋友相处都会提升或者降低上述概率。	Moreover, regardless of your genotype, you can raise or lower those chances through diet, exercise, avoidance of stress, and engagement with friends.
道达尔、埃尼、挪威石油公司（Statoil）和壳牌公司支持用碳定价（如征税或许可制度）加快向低碳能源的转型，并正在开始从内部为此做好准备。	Companies like Total, ENI, Statoil, and Shell are advocating for a carbon price (such as a tax or permit system) to hasten the transition to low-carbon energy and are beginning to prepare internally for it.
许多正统印度教徒，尤其是位处北部印度各邦的神牛带状区域（Cow Belt）的民众，崇拜牛并将其视之为gau mata，既“万物之母 ” ， 因为牛通过提供的牛奶维持人们的营养和生计 — — 但牛肉除外。	Many orthodox Hindus, particularly in the northern Indian states that comprise the so-called Cow Belt, worship the cow as gau mata, the “mother of all,” which provides nourishment and sustenance through its milk – not its meat.
当然，虽然援助并不是唯一的药方，但当其他经济来源面临枯竭之时它就是最为现实和关键的一环。 而这些援助款项将可以为刺激私人部门增长的计划提供一个坚实的基础。	It is needed to lay the foundations to help stimulate private sector growth.
大量民兵都参与进来同卡扎菲军队进行作战。 之后，NTC无法向这些民兵施加纪律，甚至无法将外国武器有效地运用于刚刚成立的利比亚国家军队。	Later, the NTC was unable to impose discipline on the myriad militias that formed to fight Qaddafi’s troops, or even to direct foreign weapons efficiently to the fledgling Libyan National Army.
向国际货币基金组织求助需要付出政治代价，但这件事必须要做：只有备足了资金弹药阿根廷才能说服投资者其有能力偿还债务，而且比索不会持续暴跌。	Going to the IMF imposes a political cost, but it had to be done: only with sufficient firepower can Argentina convince investors that debts will be paid and the currency will not keep plunging.
与教育、医疗和就业前景一同到来的希望是比用无人机打击叛乱远远更加有效的武器。 叛乱带来了绝望、贫困、失业和基本服务丧失。	Providing the hope that comes with education, health care, and the prospect of a job is a far more effective weapon than a drone to combat an insurgency that feeds on despair, poverty, joblessness, and the absence of basic services.
萨迪被塔利班领导人奥马尔称为“阿拉伯酋长 ” ， 也是LIFG反民主宣言《选择是他们的 》 （ The Choice is Theirs）的执笔者，如今，他也接受了利比亚自由力量获得了胜利这一显而易见的事实。	The man whom Taliban leader Mullah Omar once called the “Sheikh of the Arabs,” and who authored the LIFG’s anti-democracy manifesto The Choice is Theirs, accepted the apparent victory of Libya’s more liberal forces.
倘若你能用心聆听，而非仅仅从主流媒体的哈哈镜中来了解他们，你会听到一些有着深邃思想的牢骚，还有超越了时代的方案。	If you actually listen to them, instead of just reading accounts transmitted through the distorting mirror of the mainstream media, you hear grievances that are profound, as well as some proposals that are actually ahead of their time.
在接下来的七年里，团结工会为再次获得合法身份进行了斗争，并建立起欧洲自希特勒战争以来最大的地下抵抗网络。	For the next seven years, Solidarity fought for re-legalization, building the biggest underground network of resistance Europe had seen since Hitler’s war.
对某些国家来说，2012年的政治是一股积极力量：例如意大利总理马里奥·蒙蒂（Mario Monti）将自己的国家从金融风暴边缘力挽狂澜的能力。	In some cases during 2012, politics was a force for good: consider Prime Minister Mario Monti’s ability to pull Italy back from the brink of financial turmoil.
《欧洲联盟基本权利宪章》将具有法律效力，对公民的司法保护也将通过降低欧洲法院的门槛以及扩大该法院的司法裁决权而得到加强。	The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights will become legally binding and the judicial protection of citizens will be enhanced by facilitating their access to the European Court of Justice and by extending the Court’s jurisdiction.
正是这些不完全契约构成了中国过去三十多年市场竞争不断加强的基础。 而在制度和意识形态逐渐变化后，许多不完全契约就顺利过渡到了有明确私有产权的民营企业及上市公司。	In that sense, these incomplete contracts laid the foundation for market-oriented competition in China, before it was possible – owing to institutional and ideological barriers – to achieve clearly defined private property rights.
由于政治家顺应民意而不是领导民意，因此不能指望当选官员在公众不知情的情况下拯救公众，而必须由公众自身明确地提出生存要求。	Since politicians follow public opinion rather than lead it, it must be the public itself that demands its own survival, not elected officials who are somehow supposed to save us despite ourselves.
最近由国际货币基金组织研究部门进行的一项研究用过去30年的数据来评估金融全球化的影响，传达了两条信息。	A recent study by the IMF’s research department, using data from the past 30 years to assess the effects of financial globalization, conveys two messages.
总统普京对邻国和中东的干预，及其针对美国和其他国家的网络攻击，虽然本意是让俄罗斯看上去重新强大起来，但从长期看只能让俄罗斯的长期前景更加恶化。	President Vladimir Putin’s interventions in neighboring countries and the Middle East, and his cyber attacks on the US and others, though intended to make Russia look great again, merely worsen the country’s long-term prospects.
从我个人的经验出发，我知道上哲学课能让学生成为素食主义者，让他们追求将一般收入贡献给慈善事业，甚至让他们向陌生人捐献肾脏。	I know from my own experience that taking a course in philosophy can lead students to turn vegan, pursue careers that enable them to give half their income to effective charities, and even donate a kidney to a stranger.
反对派的英雄领导人昂山素季和新任缅甸总统登盛能像20世纪90年代初曼德拉和德克拉克在南非那样推行巧妙而和平的政治转型吗？	And can Aung San Suu Kyi, the heroic opposition leader, and Thein Sein, Burma’s new president, engineer a political transition as skillfully and peacefully as Mandela and de Klerk did for South Africa in the early 1990’s?
要想成功，这种向和平的过渡就必须要遣散军队、解除武装并使从前的战士重新融入社会，以及进行社会服务和基础设施的重建和恢复。	To succeed, the transition to peace requires demobilization, disarmament and reintegration of former combatants, as well as reconstruction and rehabilitation of services and infrastructure.
然而绝大多数经济学家却预测此举对经济增长率的提升将远低于特朗普和他的经济顾问们吹嘘的每年1 % （ 或更多 ） 。	But, by an overwhelming majority, economists predict that the increase in the growth rate will fall far short of the annual gain of one percentage point (or more) hyped by Trump and his economic advisers.
自从法国和荷兰对提议中的欧盟《宪法条约》说“不”以来，形势按着不可避免的轨迹发展，而其速度比我们预想的还要块。	Since the shock of the French and Dutch “no” votes against the European Union’s proposed Constitutional Treaty, events have followed their inevitable course, but more rapidly than expected.
随之而来的是身着无聊蓝西装的谨小慎微的政客，他们承认困难的问题没有容易的解决办法，鄙视空洞的承诺，赞成丘吉尔式的汗水和劳作。	What comes next is the era of the prudent politician in a boring blue suit who acknowledges that hard problems have no easy solutions, and who spurns towering promises in favor of Churchillian sweat and toil.
正如五角大楼副主任罗伯特·凯斯伦准将所说的那样 ， “ 我们消灭他们的速度远远比不上他们自我复制的速度 。 ”	As Brig. General Robert Caslen, the Pentagon’s deputy director for the war on terrorism, put it, “We are not killing them faster than they are being created.”
哥伦比亚的新总统胡安·曼努埃尔·桑托斯停止了与委内瑞拉的战争势头，通过恢复地区外交渠道安抚了整个“玻利瓦尔轴心 ” （ 委内瑞拉、厄瓜多尔以及玻利维亚 ） ， 以此表现出了真正的气概。	Colombia’s new president, Juan Manuel Santos, showed genuine courage in cutting short a march to war with Venezuela and calming down the entire Bolivarian axis (Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia) by reviving the region’s diplomatic channels.
决策者对危机的反应并没有纠正这些问题；更糟糕的是，反而加剧了其中一些问题并创造了新的问题 — — 不仅美国是如此。	Policymakers’ response to the crisis failed to address these issues; worse, it exacerbated some of them and created new ones – and not just in the US.
他们发现HIV/艾滋病、饥饿、自由贸易和疟疾是人类的当务之急。 我们在这些事务方面的投入会取得最佳效果。	They found that dealing with HIV/AIDS, hunger, free trade, and malaria were the world’s top priorities, where we could do the most good for our money.
与其苦苦寻觅针对某些特定选项风险的全面权威性判断，不如考察这一判断背后的多种假设 — — 因为它们才是决定相关决策情景的核心因素。	Instead of seeking definitive global judgments about the risks of particular choices, it is wiser to consider the assumptions behind such advice – since these are central in determining the conditions under which the advice is relevant.
债务 — — 比如某种政府或企业债券，它以某个价格买卖，这个价格又是通货膨胀和违约风险的函数 — — 可以在国内交易。	Debt – for example, a government or corporate bond that is bought and sold for a price that is a function of inflation and default risk – can be traded domestically.
此外，尽管原油价格下跌本身有利于作为主要净进口国主义的日本，但其对其他主要经济体的消极效应正在溢出影响日本出口商。	Moreover, while the decline in the price of crude oil is, in itself, beneficial for Japan, a major net importer, its negative impact on other major economies is spilling over onto Japanese exporters.
区分Nexus和 “他”所操作的收割机这一概念问题将导致人们无法在如何实施机器人税方面无法达成一致。	The conceptual problem of differentiating between Nexus and the harvester “he” operates would make it impossible to agree on how a robot tax should work.
按照目前的宪法，地方政府有权享受所辖领土上发现新油田带来的收益，与此同时，只有现存油田的一部分收入必须上缴伊拉克中央政府。	Under the current constitution, local governments have the right to exploit (and profit directly from) oil extracted from new sites beneath their territory, while only a share of the income from existing sites must go to Iraq’s central government.
南非的城市目前仍处于种族分割，空间效率低下的状况，大量民众仍然生活在非正式居住区，而这些地方往往跟用工地点相距甚远。	South Africa’s cities are still racially fragmented and spatially inefficient. Too many people still live in informal settlements, often far from available work opportunities.
但强化促进社会包容的领域的制度也是文化改革的一种形式，这里的目标是让增长对广义生活水平的贡献最大化和强化其恢复力。	But the strengthening of institutions in areas that promote social inclusion is also a form of structural reform, in this case aimed at maximizing the contribution of growth to broad living standards and strengthening its resilience.
这些转变可能使今天人们寻求平衡的人民币兑美元汇率的努力在事后看起来也许像以前对人民币兑美元平衡汇率的计算一样完全是一种妄想。	These changes are likely to make today’s attempts to find an equilibrium yuan-dollar exchange rate seem just as chimerical in hindsight as previous calculations of the yen-dollar equilibrium rate.
这对比较所有投资方案至关重要，而且还可以确定资产管理绩效是否令人满意，并向利益相关方证明他们的财富正在被负责任的管理着。	This is crucial for comparing all investment options, but also for determining whether performance has been satisfactory, and to show stakeholders that their wealth is being managed responsibly.
尽管有民主的前提，但大多数西方国家政府在与这些党派接触方面还是颇为勉强，在接受伊斯兰主义者通过选举掌权的事实上也是如此。	Despite this democratic endorsement, most Western governments have been reluctant to engage with these parties or to prepare for Islamists coming to power through the ballot box.
没有任何一个国家胆敢如此漠视欧盟的预算规定，或是积累了如此巨大的公共债务负担，也没有一个欧盟国家能将一个无法运作的国家机器和一个缺乏竞争力的私营经济结合到如此恶劣的程度。	No other country flouted the European Union’s budget rules the way Greece did, or has accumulated as large a public-debt burden, and no other EU country combines to the same extent a dysfunctional state and an uncompetitive private economy.
尽管如此，各种计划和峰会固然能够为世界发展中和最不发达国家提供提高连通性的起点，但要想弥合数字差距，还需要更多的支持。	Still, while programs and summits can offer the world’s developing and least-developed countries a place to start in their push for greater connectivity, more support is needed if we are ever to close the digital divide.
其他欧盟成员国则需要决定留在缩编后的欧元区还是重新采用其自身的国家货币，并可能盯住重新启用的德国马克或法郎。	For their part, other EU member countries would have to decide whether to retain the euro in its truncated form or revert to their own national currencies, possibly pegging them to the revived Deutsche Mark or franc.
尽管研究表明，当人们参与到卫生规划时，医疗服务会有所改善，但“参与式治理”在许多发展中国家并不常见。	Although research shows that services improve when people participate in health planning, “participatory governance” is not a common feature in many developing countries.
但允许希腊违约而继续留在欧元区绝不是选项之一：这将向其他欧元区国家释放一个信号，你可以累积巨额债务，由欧洲央行供应资金，根本不需要考虑偿还问题。	But allowing Greece to default and still remain in the eurozone is not an option: it would signal that other eurozone countries could amass huge debts, funded by the ECB, without having any intention of repaying.
现在已经有传言说前进党内部要有宫廷政变，目的在于用副总理、元老佩雷斯或者广受欢迎的外长利夫尼取代奥尔默特。	There are already rumors about a palace coup within Kadima, aimed at replacing Olmert with either the deputy prime minister, the veteran Shimon Peres, or the popular foreign minister, Tzipi Livni.
克里姆林正在东乌克兰和叙利亚地区进行军事冒险，尽管这些冲突规模有限，但人们不禁怀疑这个国家是否真正有能力承担。	The Kremlin is pursuing military adventures in Eastern Ukraine and Syria, and though these conflicts are limited in scope, one wonders if the country can really afford them.
那场失败，以及双方针对究竟在会谈上提出了哪些条件的情绪化反应，在某种程度上导致了2000年冬的第二次巴勒斯坦人暴动以及随之而来的暴力对抗。	That failure, and the emotional responses from both sides as to what was or was not offered in the talks, helped spark the violence which led to the second intifada in the winter of 2000.
如果能在国际社会的支持下获得增长和利用，那么直到今天还被认为是“穷人的能源”的生物质完全可以成为财富之源。	Considered the “energy of the poor” until today, biomass could become a source of wealth if it is grown and harnessed with the support of the international community.
董事的作用不仅是确保投资回报；他们还要在决策时适当考虑社区、雇员、供应商、消费者甚至整个经济的利益。	Board directors’ role is not simply to ensure return on investment; it is also to make decisions with due consideration for the community, employees, suppliers, consumers, and even the overall economy.
（普京不会承认这一点，但他很渴望来自印古什领导人的赞美，因为和相邻的车臣和达吉斯坦一样，印古什也常常成为伊斯兰激进主义的温床。	(Putin wouldn’t admit it, but he covets praise from the leader of Ingushetia, which, like neighboring Chechnya and Dagestan, is often a breeding ground for Islamist radicalism.)
同样道理，政府在体育领域受人关注的程度远不及世界杯，但很多政治报导却对哪位政治家步步高升、哪位政治家灰头土脸更加津津乐道。	Likewise, government is vastly inferior to the World Cup as a sporting spectacle, but much political reporting focuses on who played well and who played badly.
乌克兰所捍卫的原则 — — 即作为欧盟基础的原则 — — 将会被抛弃，欧盟将不得不投入比帮助新乌克兰获得成功更多的钱捍卫它自己。	The principles that Ukraine is defending – the very principles on which the EU is based – will be abandoned, and the EU will have to spend a lot more money on defending itself than it would need to spend helping the new Ukraine succeed.
欧洲领导人急切地想打消其他成员国效仿英国的念头，可能不会向英国提供有助于减轻脱欧痛苦的条件 — — 特别是在进入欧洲统一市场方面。	European leaders, eager to deter other member states from following suit, may be in no mood to offer the UK terms – particularly concerning access to Europe’s single market – that would soften the pain of leaving.
相比之下，在法国和荷兰投否决票之后的两年，尽管推动否决的那些法国政客们一再要求，也还没有任何迹象表明有后备计划出台。	By contrast, two years after the French and Dutch No votes, there is no sign of a Plan B, despite the claims of the French politicians who helped mobilize the No vote.
但是，德国的外交政策素来以连续性著称，前总理施罗德办公厅主任、新任外长弗兰克·沃尔特·施泰因迈尔多次重申土耳其应当具有完整的成员资格。	But German foreign policy has always been marked by continuity, and the new foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the chief of staff under former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, has repeatedly advocated full membership for Turkey.
但国会共和党决定撤销SEC规则，并且立刻经由特朗普签署为法律，这是一次赤裸裸的犬儒主义行动，只能让特朗普宣称要大力铲除的“腐败”制度持久化。	But congressional Republicans’ decision to scrap the SEC rule, which Trump quickly signed into law, was an act of pure cynicism that helps perpetuate the “corrupt” system that Trump claims he ran against.
国际刑事法院启动了并开始运行，包括墨西哥在内的107个国家已经批准了设立该法庭的条约，并加入其司法管辖范围。	The International Criminal Court is up and running, and 107 states, including Mexico, have ratified the treaty establishing the court and acceded to its jurisdiction.
到2007年底，全世界所有国家的政府都应该开始为2012年以后的气候变化体系进行谈判。 那时，现在的京都议定书就将失效。	By the end of 2007, all of the world’s governments should begin negotiations on a climate-change system for the years after 2012, when the current Kyoto Protocol expires.
成百上千万缺乏能源、散居各地的非洲人日均收入不到2.5美元，但却构成了每年超过100亿美元的能源大市场。	Millions of energy-poor, disconnected Africans earning less than $2.50 a day constitute an energy market worth $10 billion a year.
在美国总统选战中，推定共和党提名人唐纳德·特朗普在提到他在初选中最接近的竞争对手时总是称其为“撒谎的泰德·科鲁兹 ” 。	In the United States’ presidential election campaign, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, seldom referred to his closest competitor in the primaries without calling him “Lying Ted Cruz.”
要对2013进行预言，就是要预计美国政府内部分裂有多严重，一个分化的欧洲国家又会对各自的危机作何反应。	To forecast 2013 is to predict how divided government in the US and a divided Europe respond to their respective crises.
由于未偿还私人和公共债务数量巨大，因此恶性通胀，布特尔写道 ， “ 是一个超越人类想象力的噩梦 。 ”	"Given the huge levels of outstanding private and public debt, bad deflation, as Bootle writes, “is a nightmare almost beyond imagining."""
虽然经济学家们对资本投资，技术革新以及提高劳动者知识技术水平这三者中哪种更能提升生产力众说纷纭，但它们都有其积极作用。	Productivity can be enhanced by capital investment, technological innovation, and improvements in the knowledge and skills of the labor force, though economists disagree on which has the largest impact.
事实上，在2011年承认这一点的恰恰是名为阿方索·卡诺（吉列尔莫·萨恩斯·巴尔加斯的化名）的哥伦比亚革命武装力量前领导人。	Indeed, none other than the FARC’s former leader, Alfonso Cano (the nom de guerre of Guillermo Sáenz Vargas), acknowledged this in 2011.
在这样的环境下，决策者很可能会如同此前多次发生过的那样，将宏大的欧元区改革计划往后推，认为危机期间所采取的改革已经足够。	In this context, policymakers may well decide, as they have so many times before, to put ambitious eurozone reforms on the back burner, deciding that the reforms pursued during the crisis are sufficient.
尽管如此，在过去30年中，工资占国民收入比重在下降，MIT教授埃里克·布莱恩约尔弗森（Erik Brynjolfsson）和安德鲁·麦克菲（Andrew McAfee）认为原因在于“第二机器时代 ” 。	However, over the last 30 years, the share of wages in national income has been falling, owing to what MIT professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee call the “second machine age.”
amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 因此在各国预见危机的时候，结果将会是欧元区扩大而非缩小。	The implication, then, is a larger euro area, not a smaller one, as more countries see the writing on the wall.
以安吉莱德斯（Phil Angelides）为首的金融危机调查委员会（Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission）确实给出了关于危机的报告 — — 事实上，给出了三份报告。	The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, chaired by Phil Angelides, did produce a report on the crisis – in fact, three reports.
我希望通过HICCup的工作学到很多经验，但我已经可以确定，最大的问题将是找到人手在各社区应对挑战。 可复制性和人情味之间的最优平衡点在哪里？	While I expect to learn much more as I work on HICCup, I am already sure that the biggest problem will be finding people to take on the challenges in each community. What’s the optimal balance between replicability and the human touch?
这意味着培训卫生工作者；建立社区级支持网络（如母亲互助团体 ） ； 投资于移风易俗运动；建立欢迎和鼓励母乳喂养的文化等。	That means training health workers; establishing community-level support networks, such as mother-to-mother groups; investing in behavioral-change campaigns; and creating a culture in which breastfeeding is welcome and encouraged.
瑞典国家应急机构表示俄罗斯的目标是助推瑞典国内争端 ，从而转移人们对俄罗斯在欧洲其他地区活动的注意力。	The MSB said Russia’s goal was to fuel Swedish domestic disputes and divert attention away from Russian activities elsewhere in Europe.
50年代来自煤和钢社团的外溢效应导致了欧洲经济共同体的产生，接着又出现了欧洲共同体，最后成立了欧盟。	Spillover effects from the original Coal and Steel Community of the 1950's led to the creation of the European Economic Community, then to the European Community, and finally to the creation of the Union.
尽管它规定税收必须以一致同意（common consent）为前提，但这一同意是通过高等和低等贵族、主教和修道院长的集会形成 — — 在骑士制度时代，就连骑士也无资格与会。	Although it established the requirement of common consent to taxation, that consent was to be obtained from an assembly of earls, barons, bishops, and abbots – in the age of chivalry, not even knights were invited to participate.
这个问题有时被称为“复原格拉斯-斯蒂格尔（Glass-Steagall）法案 ” ， 是引用了大萧条时期的立法 — — 1933年的银行法案 — — 将商业银行和投资银行业务各自区分开来。	This issue is sometimes referred to as “reinstating Glass-Steagall,” a reference to the Depression-era legislation – the Banking Act of 1933 – that separated commercial and investment banking.
但是，近几年来，麻疹日益普遍，2013年病例数达到了150以上，去年又增加至644人 — — 这是20世纪90年代以来全年报告人数最多的一年。	In recent years, however, measles has become increasingly common, with the number of cases climbing above 150 in 2013, and then jumping to 644 last year – the most cases recorded in a single year since the late 1990s.
纽约 — — 继希腊、爱尔兰分别爆发危机之后，财政瘟疫传染到了葡萄牙、西班牙甚至意大利，欧元区已陷入严重危机之中。	NEW YORK – After the Greek and Irish crises and the spread of financial contagion to Portugal, Spain, and possibly even Italy, the eurozone is now in a serious crisis.
从传统货币收入定义出发，CBO发现实际中位家庭收入在1980—2010年间仅仅增加了15 % ， 与人口普查局的测算相当。	With the traditional definition of money income, the CBO found that real median household income rose by just 15% from 1980 to 2010, similar to the Census Bureau’s estimate.
平心而论，纳瓦尔尼的支持者可以方便地移民国外；但是，受纳瓦尔尼选战的鼓舞，他们愿意看看他能否带来不同。	To be sure, Navalny’s backers could emigrate comfortably; but, invigorated by their candidate’s campaign, they are willing to see whether he can make a difference.
两者之差为GDP的3 % ， 因此，20%的进口税和20%的出口补贴将让GDP净增0.6 % ， 或每年1,200亿美元。	Given the difference of 3% of GDP, the 20% import tax and 20% export subsidy raises a net 0.6% of GDP, now equal to $120 billion a year.
没错，考虑到爱尔兰可以自己印刷货币来偿还那些利率只有1%的外债，上述大部分成果都仅仅是缓解了债务偿付问题。	True, much of this is mere debt-service relief, given that Ireland was able to repay its foreign liabilities with self-printed money, for which it pays only 1% interest.
随着辩论的焦点从通货紧缩转至旨在刺激经济增长的措施上，实行更明智的税收政策对于维持当前经济的适度平衡至关重要。	As the debate shifts from austerity towards measures aimed at stimulating growth, smarter taxation will be essential to getting the balance right.
去年，亚马逊因为出售印有印度诸神的门垫而激怒了许多印度人，催生了愤怒的热门标签#BoycottAmazon（抵制亚马逊 ） 。	Last year, Amazon enraged many Indians by offering doormats with pictures of Indian gods and goddesses, prompting the furious hashtag #BoycottAmazon.
欧元区政治领导人同意开始就规模大大增加（价值860亿欧元，几乎等于希腊GDP的一半）的方案进行谈判。	The eurozone’s political leaders agreed to start negotiations on a much larger package, worth €86 billion, almost half of Greece’s GDP.
有人可能认为此类学校或许会令巴切莱特这样的进步领袖感到自豪 — — 原因之一是她本人也曾毕业于类似的学校。	One might expect that such schools would make a progressive leader like Bachelet proud – not least because she herself attended one.
该调查的范围有所扩大，特朗普的女婿贾雷德·库什纳（Jared Kushner）和他的儿子小唐纳德都已经受到牵连。	That investigation has broadened to include Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his son Donald Jr.
四大支柱支撑着亚太战略调整的努力。 首先是美国对20世纪成功推动该地区和平安全的一整套处事原则的长期坚持。	This effort rests on four pillars.The first is America’s longstanding commitment to a set of principles that helped to advance peace and security in the region in the twentieth century.
新产品陷入停滞，老产品不再像过去那样盈利丰厚（因为竞争对手学会了如何让产品更好 ） ， 而市场和消费者会喜新厌旧。	New products stall, old products are not as profitable as they once were (because competitors figure out how to make something better), and markets and consumers move on.
斯坦福—在今天的媒体上，子虚乌有的观点、天花乱坠的宣传和流言层出不穷，科学方法 — — 我们根据实证和可测的证据确定什么是真的手段 — — 应该成为现实性的试金石。	STANFORD – In today’s media landscape, where unfounded opinions, hype, and rumors are rife, the scientific method – the means by which we determine, based on empirical and measurable evidence, what is true – should serve as a touchstone of reality.
首先，东盟应该遵循2006年东盟资深顾问团（Eminent Persons Group）做出的建议，引入多数决策规则。	For starters, it should follow a previous suggestion, made by the ASEAN Eminent Persons Group in 2006, to introduce majority decision-making.
但在这样的环境中生活的难度却远远不像继续在孤儿院生活那样令人望而生畏，而这种假设的前提是戴维在孤儿院里能够存活下来。	The difficulties of living in such circumstances, however, are surely less daunting than the hazards David would have faced had he stayed in the orphanage – assuming that he would have survived at all.
如果脱盟在英国这么一个稳定和政治冷漠的国家都能实现，金融市场和世界各地的企业都会在欧洲其他地区和美国的民粹主义回潮忐忑不安。	If Brexit wins in a country as stable and politically phlegmatic as Britain, financial markets and businesses around the world will be shaken out of their complacency about populist insurgencies in the rest of Europe and the US.
因此，亚洲正在向我们走来：亚洲市场、亚洲国家、亚洲消费者、亚洲金融家（比如，亚洲中央银行负责为美国巨额预算赤字筹集资金 ） 、 亚洲科学家、亚洲工程师和亚洲公司。	So the Asians are coming: as markets, as states, as consumers, as financiers (Asian central banks, for example, are responsible for financing America’s whopping budget deficits), as scientists and engineers, and as corporations.
可以肯定，慢性及传染性疾病也需要引起我们的重视；我们无法在一夜之间重组整个卫生系统，而且我们也不应当抛弃那些因为非手术型疾病而接受治疗的人。	To be sure, chronic and infectious diseases need our attention, too; we cannot restructure health systems overnight, nor should we turn our backs on those being treated for non-surgical illnesses.
对于捷克共和国、匈牙利和斯洛伐克而言，与波兰的紧密合作并不一定是保护它们在欧盟的利益的最佳方式。 因为它们的利益与���个人口众多而充满自信的波兰的利益可能并不相同。	For the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, close cooperation with Poland may not be the best way to protect their interests in the EU, as their interests and the interests of a big, self-confident Poland may not be identical.
也许是意识到获得充分娱乐和心不在焉的老百姓不太会对公共政策发牢骚，共产党已经允许娱乐节目沿袭西方的模式从而放宽了在微观上的审查。	Perhaps realizing that an entertained and distracted populace is less likely to complain about public policy, the Party has allowed entertainment programming to follow the Western model, lessening the need for micro-managed censorship.
但以前总统乌里维（Álvaro Uribe）为首的反对阵营预计将迫使总统桑托斯重回谈判桌，与FARC谈判截然不同的新和平协议。	Yet the deal’s opponents, led by former President Álvaro Uribe, expect to force President Juan Manuel Santos to head back to the negotiating table and produce a radically different kind of peace agreement with the FARC.
14英尺的潮涌乘着一个世纪以来全球变暖所造成的海平面上升以及变暖的地球的变暖的海水的东风，留下一地狼藉。	Its 14-foot surge of seawater was backed by the sea-level rise already caused by a century of global warming, and the storm’s sweep and intensity was fueled by a warming planet’s warmer ocean waters.
该峰会还将研究确保发展援助投向穷人的更加办法，学习抗艾滋病、结核病和疟疾全球基金（Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria）等成功计划的经验。	It will also identify better ways to ensure that development aid reaches the poor, taking lessons from successful programs such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
因此，在近几年来石油价格下跌的情况下，公司能够裁撤数千工人而不必担心失业率升高或给政府带来巨大的财政压力。	As a result, following the rapid decline in oil prices of recent years, companies could lay off thousands of workers without having to worry about raising the unemployment rate or putting a substantial burden on government coffers.
因此，2003年3月，美国入侵伊拉克，造成了长达十余年的持续内战；无效的巴格达中央政府和现在伊斯兰国的崛起。	So, in March 2003, the United States invaded Iraq, resulting in a state of near-constant civil war for over a decade; an ineffectual central government in Baghdad; and now the rise of the Islamic State.
批准1951年《难民公约》的国家在实践中从未真正严格执行过，这导致联合国难民事务高级专员公署的行动能力是十分有限的。	Countries that ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention have never fully adhered to it in practice, which limits the UNHCR’s ability to act.
而贝卢斯科尼则像一部肥皂剧的男主角那样疲于应付自己接连不断的性丑闻，根本无力遏制北方联盟这边大张旗鼓的挑衅。	And Berlusconi, consumed as he is with defending his difficult position as the main protagonist in a seemingly endless soap opera of sex scandals, is not capable of reining in such blatant provocations on the part of the Lega Nord.
德国成功保留了其工业基础，这与富裕国家的标准做法 — — 将制造业外包给劳动力成本更低的地区形成了鲜明对比。	Germany’s success in retaining its industrial base contradicts rich countries’ standard practice of outsourcing manufacturing to locations with lower labor costs.
伦敦—希腊银行已经重新开门，希腊政府也按期偿付了欧洲央行和国际货币基金组织（IMF ） 。 那么，希腊差点死去的经验是否标志着欧元危机的结束？	LONDON – Now that Greek banks have reopened and the government has made scheduled payments to the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, does Greece’s near-death experience mark the end of the euro crisis?
墨西哥领导人一直在谈论地区自由贸易谈判的问题，但很容易就能发现，他们的真正兴趣在美国市场，其80%的出口都流向美国。	Its leaders always talked the talk of regional free trade, but no Sherlock Holmes was needed to discover that their real interest lay in the US market, where over 80% of Mexican exports go.
但如果选民现在抛弃左翼力量及其所谓的“亲民”政策，这并非是因为他们现在更喜欢“阶级敌人 ” ， 而是因为他们已经改变了叙事方式。	But if voters are now jettisoning the left and its supposedly “pro-people” policies, it is not because they now prefer the “class enemy.” It is because they have changed narratives.
作为联合国秘书长，潘基文已经实践了他自称的成为完美外交官的理论，并且在遏制联合国官僚机构膨胀和中东问题上都取得了很大的进展。	As Secretary-General, Ban has lived up to his self-styled vision of being the consummate diplomat, and has made some important gains in tackling the UN's bureaucratic bloat as well as dealing with the Middle East.
南非总统姆贝基召集津巴布韦的政治团体进行和谈，但是如此没有成果以致最近反对派领导人一致指责姆贝基在和谈进程的问题对世界撒了谎。	South African president Thabo Mbeki convened negotiations with Zimbabwe’s political groups; but they have been so unfruitful that opposition leaders recently all but accused Mbeki of lying to the world about the progress of the talks.
哈萨克斯坦获得独立时正逢国际合作、自由贸易和集体安全大受鼓舞的时期，长期以来，它也致力于支持这些原则。	Kazakhstan achieved independence at a time when international cooperation, free trade, and collective security were encouraged, and it has long worked to support these principles.
根据最新的美国人口普查报告，2013年中位全职男性工人工资收入是50,033美元，和1973年的可比（经通胀调整）数字49,678美元相差无几。	According to a recent US Census report, the median full-time male worker earned $50,033 in 2013, barely distinguishable from the comparable (inflation-adjusted) figure of $49,678 in 1973.
即使一大批目的地国都各自实施了一套连贯一致的移民政策，总供应量将充分增加以满足总需求的可能性依然是非常低的。	Even if a wide range of destination countries each implemented a coherent set of immigration policies, the chances that total supply would rise sufficiently to meet total demand is highly unlikely.
人们通常认为，美国比其他国家更加乐善好施；但是，就人口捐钱比例而言，缅甸、马耳他、爱尔兰、英国、加拿大、荷兰和冰岛都比美国做得更好。	The US is often said to be more charitable than other countries; but, in terms of the proportion of the population donating money, Myanmar, Malta, Ireland, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and Iceland all do better.
在第三种情况下，继任者可能是像梅德韦杰夫那样的自由派，而在第四种情况下，可能由目前负责管理国防的副总理德米特里·罗戈津那样的保守派人士来成为继任者。	In the third scenario, that successor might be a liberal like Medvedev, whereas in the fourth scenario, it would be a conservative like Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who currently oversees the defense industry.
某些领导人的短期利益（通常被粉饰为“国家利益 ” ） 成为了自冷战结束以来最为扰乱国际关系的因素之一。	Certain leaders’ short-term interests, often presented as “national interests,” are one of the factors roiling international relations more than any time since the end of the Cold War.
尽管微软也许会把传统的“doc”文件作为MS Word的缺省格式，但这样做却并非它的目的：最终，在全世界足够数量的人掏钱购买了Office 2007之后，无论如何挣扎喊叫，那些坚守阵地的人都会被拖着向前走。	While Microsoft could have kept the traditional “.doc” as its default format for MS Word, this would not have served its purpose: eventually, after enough of the world pays for Office 2007, holdouts will be dragged along, kicking and screaming.
不久之后，2000年到2001年互联网泡沫的破灭带来的不是萧条，而只是一场产量下滑，程度之轻，刚够用得上“衰退”这个词。	The collapse, not long after, of the dot-com bubble in 2000-2001 brought on not a depression but merely an output decline so mild as to barely warrant the name “recession.”
虽然一些政策制定者确实认识到食品行业正在模仿大型烟草公司的策略，但卢梭预测了一个更普遍的趋势：城市财富其实与公共自由不相容。	Although some policymakers do recognize that the food industry is emulating Big Tobacco’s tactics, Rousseau predicted a more general trend: urban wealth is incompatible with public liberty.
该国的旅游业也可以开发和升级，不仅面对每年前往麦加和麦地那朝拜的数百万穆斯林朝圣者，同时也面对休闲游客。	The country’s tourism sector could be developed and upgraded, not only for the millions of Muslim pilgrims who visit the holy sites of Mecca and Medina every year, but also for leisure tourists.
克劳迪娅·戈丁（Claudia Goldin）和劳伦斯·卡茨（Lawrence Katz）指出，美国的教育“例外论”让其能够先发制人，领先在人力资本方面投资不足的欧洲国家。	As Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz have shown, it was American “exceptionalism” in education that enabled the country to steal a march on European countries that were under-investing in human capital.
因为世界绝大多数人口生活的环境资源有限，我们必须认可 — — 并投资于 — — 那些正在拓展发展中世界医学前沿的科研人员所做的工作。	With the majority of the world’s population living in resource-challenged settings, we must recognize – and invest in – the efforts of those who are pushing the frontiers of medical science in the developing world.
这样能让该组织更好地实行管理（尽管斯特劳斯-卡恩的领导力堪称典范 ） ， 并将提高两大权威机构在发展中国家心目中的合法性。	This will provide for better governance (although Strauss-Kahn’s leadership has been exemplary), and will enhance both institutions’ legitimacy in the eyes of developing nations.
这些因素，加上急剧下降的商品价格，将使发达经济体的通货膨胀下跌到1%的水平，从而使人们担心会出现通货紧缩而不是滞胀。	These factors, combined with sharply falling commodity prices, will cause inflation in advanced economies to ease toward the 1% level, raising concerns about deflation, not stagflation.
奥萨马·本·拉登既没有威胁也没有收买2001年9月驾机撞向世贸中心大楼的恐怖分子：吸引他们作恶的是他的思想。	Osama bin Laden neither threatened nor paid the men who flew aircraft into the World Trade Center in September 2001: he attracted them by his ideas to do evil.
事实上，维基解密曾援引美国前国务卿希拉里·克林顿的演讲指责卡塔尔和沙特阿拉伯勾结“基地、塔利班和其他恐怖组织 。 ”	Indeed, Wikileaks quotes former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accusing Qatar and Saudi Arabia of collusion “with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other terrorist groups.”
其中一些是机构性原因：全球而言，储蓄率非常高，亚洲尤其如此，欧洲也比较高（德国的个老龄化国家存钱以备退休 ） 。	Some are structural: saving is high globally, especially in Asia but also in Europe, where aging countries like Germany put money aside for retirement.
碰巧生活和工作在受全球化冲击的传统制造业地区的人沦为多重输家：他们的工作、家庭财富以及孩子和亲人的命运都与此息息相关。	Those who happen to live and work in traditional manufacturing districts caught in the turmoil of globalization are multiple losers: their jobs, their housing wealth, and the fortunes of their children and relatives are all highly correlated.
自独立以来，政府由占多数的缅族垄断，这导致后殖民地时代本土主义于众多少数族群爆发冲突和内战，少数族群抱怨缅甸采取了地理种族隔离（geographic apartheid）制度。	Since independence, governments dominated by Myanmar’s Burman majority have allowed postcolonial nativism to breed conflict or civil war with many of the country’s minority groups, which have complained of a system of geographic apartheid.
随着肯尼亚和津巴布韦探索各自的政治未来，两国的很多情况毫无疑问将会发生改变 — — 我们当然希望是向好的方向改变。	As Kenya and Zimbabwe navigate their political futures, much in both countries will no doubt change – one hopes for the better.
他们知道，德国非常想在AMR问题上起领导作用，而德国是今年G20的主席国，届时有可能会拿出更加果断的方案。	They knew that Germany, an enthusiastic champion in the fight against AMR, would be chairing the G20 this year, and could be expected to bring bold proposals to the table.
在位于坦桑尼亚的乞力马扎罗山区 — — 在那里我们可以清晰地感受到全球变暖的影响 — — 研究员遇见了雷赫玛·伊布拉希姆。	On Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania – where the effects of global warming can already be felt – our researcher encountered 28-year-old Rehema Ibrahim.
尽管大约三分之二的公共场合枪击犯在作案前夕遭到过创伤事件 — — 通常是被炒或被甩 — — 但大部分会花几周乃至几年时间思考和准备复仇。	Though roughly two-thirds of mass public shooters experience a traumatic event immediately before carrying out the attack – usually the loss of a job or relationship – most spend weeks or even years deliberating and preparing to get their revenge.
如果超高的资源消耗发生在像中国这样的经济和影响力不断上升的人口大国，问题就会很严重。 这方面气候变化政府间委员会（Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change）等机构已经提出了令人担忧的警告。	But China’s economy and influence are growing at a time when, as dire warnings by bodies like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change demonstrate, that is not really an option.
比如，20世纪中叶，磷矿开采带来的繁荣让密克罗尼西亚岛国瑙鲁从粮食短缺和饥饿之地变成全球肥胖和2型糖尿病最严重的国家。	In the mid-twentieth century, for example, a boom in phosphate mining transformed the Micronesian island state of Nauru from a land of food shortages and starvation to the world’s leader in obesity and type-2 diabetes.
这比大萧条对美国生产力的侵蚀比例还要大 — — 而��国经济规模比1928年大了16倍（以人均衡量则大了5.5倍 ） 。	That is a higher share of America’s productive capabilities than the Great Depression subtracted – and the US economy is 16 times larger than it was in 1928 (5.5 times larger in per capita terms).
2006年6月的总统选举中他得到了45.5 %的选票 — — 虽然不足以击败阿兰·加西亚，但却足以证明他承载了众多秘鲁人的信任和希望。	In the presidential election of June 2006, he received 45.5 % of the vote – not enough to defeat Alan García, but sufficient to show how deeply he had tapped into the hopes and trust of many Peruvians.
20 ％的温室气体排放，是由于对热带森林的砍伐造成的，而要解决这一问题，明确要求我们在未来十年或二十年中停止砍伐。	One clear requirement is that tropical deforestation, which is responsible for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions, be halted within the next decade or two.
而新的哈里发帝国主张者 — — ISIS埃米尔巴格达迪（Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi）可以。	The new caliphal claimant, the Islamic State’s emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, can.
而对于那些几乎无法维持有尊严的生活，更别提花钱买票去现代“斗兽场”看场橄榄球赛的人来说，愤怒的推特显然是毫无意义的。	Raging tweets are meaningless to people who can scarcely afford a dignified living, let alone tickets to the modern-day Colosseum to watch football.
认为汇率升值会减少一国贸易盈余的观点是错误的，因为在全球一体化的经济中，国内投资会随汇率的升值而下降。	The claim that exchange-rate appreciation will reduce a country’s trade surplus is false, because, in globally integrated economies, domestic investment falls when the exchange rate appreciates.
要想做到这一点，他必须制定新的社会契约，面对灵活开放的21世纪经济不可避免的快速变化和突然破坏为最弱势群体提供保护。	To do that, he will have to forge a new social contract that protects the most vulnerable from the rapid shifts and abrupt disruptions inherent in a flexible, open twenty-first-century economy.
这次的焦点在于哈西娜如何对待诺贝尔奖得主穆罕默德·尤努斯，尤努斯是小额信贷的先驱和孟加拉乡村银行的创始人。	This time, the issue was Hasina’s treatment of the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the microcredit pioneer and founder of the Grameen Bank.
法院也并未研究被激活卵细胞 — — 即单性生殖单倍体 — — 是否构成生殖细胞，后者在欧盟同样不允许申请专利（尽管法院确实在听证会上对申请者提出了这个问题 ） 。	And it did not consider whether the activated egg cell – a “parthenote” – counts as a germ cell, which also cannot be patented in the EU (though it did pose the question to the applicants at the hearing).
当政策方向错误时，承担错误责任的现任可能 — — 也常常 — — 会通过选举被赶下台，被（至少在理论上）胜任的对手取而代之。	When policy goes awry, the incumbents responsible for the mistake can be, and often are, voted out of office, to be replaced, in principle at least, by more competent rivals.
美国政府甚至承认如果没有燃煤发电厂，南非的“经济复苏，电气化，就业以及社会指标都将受到不利影响 。 ”	The US government even acknowledged that, without a coal-fired power plant, South Africa’s “economic recovery will suffer, adversely impacting electrification, job creation, and social indicators.”
一个极端情况是每天都有400多非洲妇女和女孩在怀孕或生产中死亡，给她们的家庭造成创伤，也让遗孤陷入苦难。	At the extreme, more than 400 African women and girls die every day during pregnancy or childbirth, scarring families and plunging surviving children into hardship.
事实上，2010年亚努科维奇当选总统标志着乌克兰亲欧洲的橙色革命的结束。 2004年的橙色革命挫败了他窃取总统宝座、将乌克兰引向俄罗斯阵营的图谋。	Indeed, his election in 2010 marked the end of Ukraine’s pro-European Orange Revolution, which had defeated his effort to steal the presidential election in 2004 and keep Ukraine in the Russian camp.
根据这种解释，特朗普攻击媒体、情报机构和联邦调查局意在提前破坏上述机构的可信度，进而对它们进一步揭露特朗普和俄罗斯的交易内容造成影响。	On this interpretation, Trump’s attacks on the press, the intelligence agencies, and the FBI specifically aim to discredit these organizations in advance of further revelations regarding his dealings with Russia.
事实上，我继续写道 ， “ 考虑到中国的全面改革日程，进一步开放资本账户可以等一等；而从自由化收益不明但风险巨大的情况看，也应该等一等 。 ”	In fact, I continued, “Given China’s extensive reform agenda, further opening of the capital account can wait; and, in view of liberalization’s ambiguous benefits and significant risks, it should.”
一批新领导人进入中国的高级职位，而且提议扩大到包括食品和产品安全、能源效率和安全以及环境可持续性，因此，这一会议是在一个敏感时期召开的。	The meeting comes at a delicate time, as a new group of leaders moves into China’s senior positions, and as the agenda has been broadened to include food and product safety, energy efficiency and security, and environmental sustainability.
显而易见的问题是俄罗斯政府为何不惜牺牲公共支持也要采取无效的改革，而改革目标只是降低退休金支出，而不是真正让退休金体系走上财务可靠之路。	The obvious question is why Russia’s government is sacrificing public support to pursue an ineffective reform aimed simply at cutting pension expenditure, rather than genuinely trying to place the system on a sound financial footing.
由金及其同事，哈佛大学的保罗·法莫共同领导的非政府组织“健康伙伴 ” （ Health in Health）一直在使用抗逆转录病毒的药物（AVR）来治疗约1，000名被艾滋病毒感染的贫困的海地乡村居民，并使他们的健康和希望得以恢复。	Partners in Health, the NGO led by Kim and his colleague, Harvard University’s Paul Farmer, had used antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to treat around 1,000 impoverished HIV-infected rural residents in Haiti, and had restored them to health and hope.
无论我们多希望能够坐视不管，允许叙利亚流血事件自生自灭可能会对该地区和西方国家的安全构成严重的威胁。	However much we may wish to look away, the consequences of allowing the bloodbath in Syria to take its own course may well be disastrous for the region and for the West’s security.
希尔提出的其他一些想法，比如放松长期投资的资本要求，与将在明年实施的欧盟保险商和养老基金偿债能力要求相违背。	Some of the other ideas that Hill has floated, such as relaxing the capital standards for long-term investments, run counter to the EU solvency standards for insurers and pension funds that will be implemented next year.
它因为自由贸易、低税率和香港和澳门两大高度全球化的城市而获得巨大的优势，后两者都是中国“一国两制”下的“特别行政区 ” 。	It gains a distinct advantage from the free-trade, low-tax, and highly globalized cities of Hong Kong and Macau; both are “special administrative regions” under China’s “one country, two systems” principle.
斯坦福大学的拉伊·切蒂（Raj Chetty）和其他人指出，这绝非美国现在的情况，并且其他国家也能观察到类似的模式。	As Raj Chetty of Stanford and others have shown, this is far from being the case in the US, and similar patterns can be observed in other countries.
此外，美国经济学家卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff ）在一篇颇有影响的论文指出当一国的公共债务上升到GDP的90%以上时，其经济增长会急剧下降。	Moreover, an influential paper by the American economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff suggests that economic growth falls sharply when a country’s public debt rises above 90% of GDP.
因此，从经济上讲非理性的锁定效应（lock-in effect ） ， 以及由此导致的工人无力变换工作的情况，得以避免。	That way, economically irrational lock-in effects, whereby workers simply cannot afford to change jobs, are avoided.
如果你觉得这有些牵强，可以关注一下这一点：Instagram联合创始人麦克·克雷格（Mike Krieger）就是背井离乡来到旧金山追求财富的巴西人。	If that sounds farfetched, consider this: Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger is a Brazilian who left home to find his fortune in San Francisco.
-在不涉及使用基金组织财力的前提下，针对所有议题将采取自由抢占位置的管理模式，除非它被扩大的理事会明确否决。	- Management would be free to take a position on all issues not involving the use of Fund resources, unless it is was explicitly overruled by the expanded board.
1947年的印度就是如此，当时，英国人走了，巴基斯坦分裂出去了，大约一百万印度教和穆斯林死于互相杀戮。	That happened in India in 1947, when the British left, Pakistan broke away, and roughly a million Hindus and Muslims died in mutual slaughter.
据联合国儿童基金会和世界卫生组织的水和卫生服务供应联合监测计划的最新报告，在1990年到2008年期间获得供水的12亿多人中，大部分都获得了接到住处的水管供水。	According to a recent report by UNICEF and the World Health Organization on their joint monitoring program for water supply and sanitation, more than 1.2 billion of those who gained access to water from 1990 to 2008 had it piped to their premises.
不过，塞浦路斯仍然是一个冲突区域：尼科西亚仍然可以见到建有防御工事的街道，一支联合国维和部队在缓冲区内巡逻，而且有大量的土耳其军队在北部地区驻扎。	However, Cyprus remains a conflict zone: there are still fortified streets in Nicosia, a United Nations peacekeeping operation patrols the buffer zone, and there is a substantial Turkish military force in the north.
强化的立法基础能让美国军队与日本自卫队之间的合作更加强大，让美日同盟更加紧密，为地区和平提供可信的威慑力。	These enhanced legislative foundations should make cooperation between the US military and Japan’s Self-Defense Forces even stronger, and the alliance still more solid, providing credible deterrence in the service of peace in the region.
里根税收计划利用抵扣规定的变化和其他会计规则变化来抵消税率的大幅降低（最高税率从50%下降到28 % ） 。	The Reagan tax plan used changes in deductions and other accounting rules to pay for major cuts in tax rates that lowered the top rate from 50% to 28%.
但特朗普上台后，这些谴责失去了信誉，因为特朗普时常赞美习近平，说他是“完人 ” 、 “了不起的绅士 ” 。	But, under Trump, those condemnations have lost credibility, and not just because they are interspersed with praise for Xi, whom Trump has called “terrific” and “a great gentleman.”
（公共投资也是如此，尽管该指标占GDP比重很小，大西洋两岸的差异不足以在三年时间里造成彼此增长的重大差异 ） 。	(The same is true of public investment, though this constitutes such a small proportion of GDP that transatlantic differences could not have had a large impact on growth over a three-year horizon.)
中国政府需要在政府利益和个人权利之间、经济增长和环境保护之间以及市场角色和国家角色之间找到正确的平衡。	The government will need to find the right balance between government interests and individual rights, between economic growth and environmental stewardship, and between the role of markets and that of the state.
因此，尽管美联储购买长期资产（所谓的量化宽松，简称QE）的手笔可能有所减小，但利率告别历史低位可能不会遭遇2015年。	Thus, while there may be some reduction of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of long-term assets (so-called quantitative easing, or QE), a move away from rock-bottom interest rates is not expected until 2015 at the earliest.
最后，因为温和派的鲁哈尼目前担任总统，美国的军事打击可能破坏美伊双方就伊朗核计划达成能为双方保存颜面的方案的黄金机会。	Finally, with the moderate Rouhani now installed as President, a US military strike could undermine a golden opportunity for America and Iran to reach a face-saving solution (for both sides) on Iran’s nuclear program.
但土耳其在面对金融市场从拥抱风险（risk-on）到厌恶风险（risk-off）的突然转换时所表现出来的脆弱性其实是可预见的。	But Turkey’s vulnerability to an abrupt shift in financial markets from risk-on to risk-off was foreseeable.
超过40%的选民支持特朗普，但在全国失业不高的情况下，只有一小部分���以主要归因于他在经济萧条地区所受到的支持。	More than 40% of the electorate backs Trump, but with low unemployment nationally, only a small part of that can be explained primarily by his support in economically depressed areas.
但这不是一个系统性问题；事实上，黄金价格的上涨将弥合针对安全资产的一部分供需缺口，而这一缺口正是由于利率的零下限而导致的。	But this is not a systemic problem; and, in fact, a rise in gold prices would close part of the gap between demand and supply for safe assets that has emerged due to the zero lower bound on interest rates.
表面上看，美国直面俄国威胁的决策提醒人们欧洲此前曾怎样无力应对其临近地区发生的威胁 — — 其中尤以20世纪90年代的波斯尼亚最令人难忘。	On its surface, America’s decision to confront Russia recalls previous occasions when Europe proved unable to respond to challenges in its neighborhood – most memorably in Bosnia in the 1990s.
正如希腊经济部长米哈利斯·赫里索希季斯（Michalis Chrysochoidis）所说，这都要怪欧盟实施的补贴政策，搞得企业家们都跑到进口部门去挣快钱了。	As the Greek economics minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, has said, this is attributable to European Union subsidies, which drove entrepreneurs to follow the easy money into the import sector.
为了促使世界领导人抓住这一机会，ICRICT给出了一系列建议，被容包括规则和全球公司税治理机构改革等。	To help induce world leaders to take advantage of this opportunity, the ICRICT has issued a set of recommendations for reform of the rules and institutions governing international corporate-taxation.
毕竟，朝鲜、印度、巴基斯坦和以色列对美国和俄罗斯将核武器库存从杀伤力严重过剩削减至杀伤力略有过剩不会留下太深刻的印象。	After all, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Iran, and Israel might not be particularly impressed by a reduction in the US and Russian nuclear-weapons stockpiles from gross overkill to merely mild overkill.
在这样的背景下，难怪有47%的南方人都投票给五星运动，该党派推行全面补助的提案对于因法西斯时代社团主义而停滞不前的经济看上去似乎非常适合。	Against this backdrop, it is little wonder that 47% of Southerners voted for M5S, whose proposal for a universal subsidy would well suit an economy held back by fascist-era corporatism.
希腊的退出之举可能会对西班牙、意大利和法国这样的国家起到警示作用，在这些国家，强烈反欧洲反建制的呼声正在上升。	A Greek exit may serve as a warning to countries like Spain, Italy, and France, where strong anti-Europe or anti-establishment parties are on the rise.
而美国总统特朗普和国会共和党似乎还想通过取消和取代2010年平价医疗法 （ “ 奥巴马医保 ” ） 剥夺2,300万美国人的医疗保险。	And yet US President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seem intent on depriving 23 million more Americans of health insurance by repealing and replacing the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”).
事实上，美国现有的“技术官僚”制度 — — 确保政策制定能遵循正确的分析和经验证据 — — 所倚仗最多的人，莫过于里夫林了。	Indeed, America owes its current system of “technocracy” – which ensures that policymaking follows sound analysis and empirical evidence – more to Rivlin than to any other living human.
土耳其应邀参加欧洲理事会会议；它可以参与各种欧盟项目和《欧洲共同外交政策》的实施；同时，作为北约的成员，它也是欧盟—北约安全合作的伙伴。	Turkey is invited to Council meetings, it can participate in various EU programs and in manifestations of the European Common Foreign Policy, and, as a member of NATO, it is a partner in EU-NATO security cooperation.
但重点在于把大众的眼球和注意力吸引到有关希望与目标的故事上 — — 去提高公众的意识，而不是分散他们的注意力。	But the point is to fix eyes and hearts on a narrative of hope and purpose – to uplift, rather than distract, the public.
如今，全世界有1,800名十亿美元级富翁，其中70人生活在富有的世界大都市伦敦，而伦敦居民一边倒地反对英国退欧。	There are now 1,800 billionaires globally, 70 of whom live in wealthy and cosmopolitan London, where residents overwhelmingly opposed Brexit.
事实上，通胀风险在于增加，特别是如果美联储坚持将真实短期利率为负的情况一直保持到2016年底、并在2017年底前只提高一个百分点的话。	Indeed, the inflation risk is on the upside, especially if the Fed sticks to its plan to keep its real short-term interest rate negative until the end of 2016 and to raise it to one percentage point only by the end of 2017.
如果我们的目标是要对抗营养不良，那么给那些需要的人增加营养在挽救生命上比花几十亿美元减少碳排放量要有效5000倍。	If our goal is to fight malnutrition, policies like getting nutrients to those who need them are 5,000 times more effective at saving lives than spending billions of dollars cutting carbon emissions.
以色列和冰岛随后在1955年发行了该债券，接着，巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、阿根廷、英国、澳大利亚、墨西哥、加拿大、瑞典、新西兰、美国、法国、日本和意大利也开始发行。	Israel and Iceland were next, in 1955, followed by Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Argentina, the UK, Australia, Mexico, Canada, Sweden, New Zealand, the US, France, Japan, and Italy.
我用“繁荣 ” （ flourishing）来描述进入未知领域的旅途所带来的满足感 — — 即挑战和克服障碍的诉求带来的激动感。	I use the word “flourishing”to refer to the satisfaction from a journey into the unknown – the excitement of the challenges and the appeal of overcoming obstacles.
在十七世纪，荷兰学者雨果·格劳修斯（Hugo Grotius，他被认为是国际法的起草者）指出海盗可以在抓获他们的船上被起诉，不管他们的犯罪地点在哪里。	In the seventeenth century, the Dutch scholar Hugo Grotius, who is recognized for codifying international law, argued that pirates could be tried for their crimes, regardless of where they were committed, aboard the ships that captured them.
它利用自己可观的资本 — — 世界第三大经济体、超凡的高科技技能，以及新近摆脱了一些法律和宪法限制的军队 — — 提高自己的地缘政治实力。	Taking advantage of its considerable assets – the world’s third-largest economy, substantial high-tech skills, and a military that has recently been freed of some legal and constitutional constraints – Japan is boosting its geopolitical clout.
为了报复日方拒绝释放船长的举措，中国暗示其将召回驻日大使，停止双边部长级交流，并取消1万名中国游客的赴日行程。	In retaliation for Japan’s refusal to release the trawler captain, China hinted that it might recall its ambassador from Tokyo, suspended bilateral ministerial-level exchanges, and canceled a tour to Japan for about 10,000 Chinese.
我上大学时 ， “ 家长制”的女权主义解决方案是想象中没有等级制度的世界，人们在这里整天靠语言交流，建立起情感方面的联系。	When I was in college, the feminist solution to “patriarchy” was an imagined world without hierarchy, where people verbalized all day long and created emotional bonds.
在灾难袭来之前，双方都必须持续评估当前的法律是否为科学家和官员们的分析和公共沟通提供了清晰可行的操作标准。	Both sides must continually determine, before disaster strikes, whether existing laws provide scientists and administrators with clear, realistic standards for their analyses and public communications.
36年前，当美中两国意识到是苏联、而非各自两国构成更大威胁的时候，尼克松和毛泽东把世界政治搞得天翻地覆。	Thirty-six years ago, Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong turned world politics upside down, as both America and China realized that it was the Soviet Union, and not each other, that posed the greater threat.
"半岛的格言""观点和反面观点""已经给阿拉伯观众留下了深刻的印象，因为在阿拉伯大陆电视台，人们几乎听不到针锋相对的观点冲撞。"	"Al Jazeera's motto, ""opinion and opposing opinion,"" has galvanized Arab viewers, because clashing opinions are rarely heard on terrestrial Arab television stations."
但其实是我经常俗称为“曼—谢—利—浦”的区域最终导致北方经济引擎出类拔萃，而位于引擎核心地带的曼彻斯特无疑是早期受益者之一。	But it is what I often inelegantly call “Man-Sheff-Leeds-Pool” that distinguishes the Northern Powerhouse, and Manchester, which sits at the heart of it, is certainly among the early beneficiaries.
这一投资下降意味着更缓慢的生产率增长，而与此同时，发达国家的老龄化 — — 现在越来越多的新兴市场（如中国、俄罗斯和韩国）也是如此 — — 降低了投入生产的劳动力。	That falloff in investment implies slower productivity growth, while aging populations in developed countries – and now in an increasing number of emerging markets (for example, China, Russia, and Korea) – reduce the labor input in production.
国际社会又开始密切关注中国与其难以控制的盟友之间的关系，并希望中国作为一个想要向世界昭示自身和平崛起的新兴超级大国能发挥建设性的作用。	The international community is again firmly focused on China’s relationship with its rogue ally, and expects that, as an emerging superpower seeking to reassure the world of its peaceful rise, China will play a constructive role.
这意味着更多的杀虫剂、洗涤剂、抗生素、胶水、润滑油、防腐剂和塑料，其中有许多包含类似于哺乳动物激素的化合物。	It means more pesticides, detergents, antibiotics, glues, lubricants, preservatives, and plastics, many of which contain compounds that mimic mammalian hormones.
5月，这个包括了多位前总统、首相、外交部长、欧盟委员和高级外交官的小组向欧盟领导人提出了一系列建议。	This group, which included former presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, European Union commissioners and senior diplomats, sent a set of proposals to EU leaders in May.
通过使大量金融资源流动起来，并为政策可信度提供支持，IMF能够帮助降低高额的经济和社会成本，而这些成本常常和危机联系在一起。	With its ability to mobilize large financial resources and buttress policy credibility, the IMF can help mitigate the large economic and social costs often associated with crises.
但总统普京和国家杜马（议会）最近的提高退休年龄的决定无法解决问题 — — 反倒制造了更加严重的问题。	But the recent decision of President Vladimir Putin and the Duma (parliament) to raise the retirement age will not fix the problem – and may create more serious problems than it solves.
同样，如果一个国家通过对革新劳动市场或者保持较低的实质工资水平而实现��产力强劲增长，估计也会面临惩罚。	The same is true of a country that undergoes a period of strong productivity growth because it has reformed its labor market or kept real wages low and has a current-account surplus.
至少部分金砖国家（巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非）正在失去经济动力；而墨西哥等新新兴大国虽然看起来诱人无比，但实际上可能相当脆弱。	At least some of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) appear to be running out of steam economically; and, while new emerging powers, such as Mexico, are tempting, they may prove to be more fragile than they look.
这场根植于两国传统对立情绪和殖民时代遗毒的斗争正在侵害整个区域的利益，两方的敌对状态竟然恶化到连一个短期协议都需要第三方从中斡旋。	Rooted in ancient enmities and the legacy of the colonial era, the fighting is damaging the entire region. So virulent is the dispute that even a short-term settlement will require third-party mediation.
自20世纪70年代以来，巴沙尔一直没能培养出阿拉伯民���主义从而将信仰不同的人民统一起来，而是采用分裂的宗派政治控制叙利亚人民。	Since the 1970’s, the Assads have failed to foster Arab nationalism in order to unite the religiously divided population, resorting instead to divisive sectarian politics to control Syria’s population.
在加沙地区之外，阿拉伯之春国家（被别是埃及和突尼斯）伊斯兰政治势力的崛起为哈马斯创造了有利的周边环境。	Beyond Gaza, the rise of political Islam in the Arab Spring countries, particularly Egypt and Tunisia, has created a more Hamas-friendly neighborhood.
来自民族主义反西方政党自由民主党的代表在哈巴罗夫斯克（伯力）和弗拉基米尔地区的地方选举第二轮角逐中大胜统一俄罗斯党的候选人。	Representatives of the nationalist, anti-Western Liberal Democratic Party trounced the United Russia candidates in second-round run-offs in the gubernatorial elections in the Khabarovsk and Vladimir regions.
世界极少见到1972年尼克松访问中国或1977年埃及总统萨达特（Anwar el-Sadat）访问耶路撒冷这样的改变历史的举动。	Too seldom does the world see history-changing steps like Richard Nixon’s trip to China in 1972 or Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat’s visit to Jerusalem in 1977.
事实上，如果最低工资按国会民主党的建议提高到10.10美元/小时，将会有大约3,000万工人从中受益。	Indeed, about 30 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, as proposed by Congressional Democrats.
SEC主席怀特（Mary Jo White）否认了关于该规则马上会被实施的传闻，她最近对律师说，这个问题并不在最优先事项名单中。	Denying rumors that such a rule will be promulgated soon, SEC Chair Mary Jo White recently told lawmakers that this issue is not at the top of her list of priorities.
这些领导人 — — 他们主张只需要他们就能解决国家的问题 — — 常常在公司届寻找，并且常常可以找到。	These leaders – who assert that they alone can fix their countries’ problems – are often sought, and found, in the corporate world.
另一个问题是主宰农产品营销、生产和投资的跨国企业出现寡头化倾向，这在很大程度上使小农和消费者，尤其是穷人，遭受损害。	Another problem is that fewer and fewer transnational agro-businesses now dominate marketing, production, and inputs. This comes largely at the expense of small farmers and consumers, particularly the poor.
古特雷斯感慨道“对此类战争尚没有任何监管计划 ” ， 并指出“尚不清楚该领域将以何种方式适用日内瓦公约或国际人道主义法 。 ”	Guterres lamented that “there is no regulatory scheme for that type of warfare,” noting that “it is not clear how the Geneva Convention or international humanitarian law applies to it.”
最好机会摆在默克尔面前 — — 她的新政府应该任命独立的专家委员会评估替代方案，不要被现存禁忌所束缚。	The best way to make one would be for Merkel’s next government to appoint an independent expert commission to evaluate the alternatives, without regard to the prevailing taboos.
颇能说明问题的是，有影响力的新保守主义者理查德·派瑞2003年的时候说他 仍然 是一名注册的民主党党员，这是出于对体现了这些诺言的强有力的前参议员亨利·杰克逊的“留恋 ” 。	Tellingly, the influential neo-conservative Richard Perle said in 2003 that he was still a registered Democrat, out of “nostalgia” for Henry “Scoop” Jackson, the powerful former Senator who embodied these commitments.
穆尔西选择的时机颇值一提：在因牵线加沙停战协议而赢得国际喝彩后的那一天，他正面袭击了襁褓中的埃及民主。	Morsi’s timing was remarkable: the day after winning international acclaim for his successful efforts to broker a truce in Gaza, he staged a frontal assault on Egypt’s nascent democracy.
当美国和欧洲政客、记者和人权专家想了解土耳其问题时，他们找到葛兰分子的自由派受益者，听这些人讲述早已编好的故事。	When American and European politicians, reporters, and human rights specialists looked for insight on Turkey, they turned to the Gülenists’ liberal beneficiaries, who fed them the established narratives.
打破这一循环 — — 从而有效遏制气候变化 — — 的唯一办法是管理好水和能源之间的联系（还有粮食，粮食生产需要依靠水和能源 ） 。	The only way to break this cycle – and thus to mitigate climate change effectively – is to manage the nexus between water and energy (as well as food, production of which depends on water and energy).
而在2008年后，顺周期财政收缩模式又导致收入下降和债务-GDP比上升，不仅希腊如此，爱尔兰、意大利、葡萄牙和西班牙也是如此。	And, after 2008, the pattern of pro-cyclical fiscal contraction, leading to falling income and rising debt-to-GDP ratios, played out not just in Greece, but in Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain as well.
即使算上变暖导致的主要环境损害，我们也会赔钱，因为挽回的��失只有6850亿美元而我们在这上面的投入达8000亿美元。	Even accounting for the key environmental damage from warming, we would lose money, with avoided damages of just $685 billion for our $800 billion investment.
如果他们的说法得到确认，那么愤世嫉俗者们终于不幸言中：我们的革命不过是决定这个或那个阶级、这个或那个人，能够大权在握，来贯彻自身的意志。	If their claim is upheld, then the cynics are right: our revolution was merely about whether one class or another, one person or another, would obtain the power to work his or her will.
直到几十年前，民主领导人需要一轮一轮沿着选举的阶梯往上爬，经历零售式政治（retail politics ） 、 树桩演讲和集合大多数工作阶级的要求等历练。	Until a few decades ago, democratic leaders had to climb the electoral ladder, rung by rung, acquiring along the way a facility for retail politics, stump speaking, and the demands of assembling a working majority.
大多数电视频道被四大集团所拥有，控制人大多与执政党乌克兰地方党（Party of Regions）关系密切。	Most television channels are in the hands of four groups, most of which have close links to the ruling Party of Regions.
当时他的行动在国内外都得到了广泛支持，人们都认为这是个勇敢无畏，早该拍板而且必须下达的决定，并预计行动的成果必将立竿见影。	Back then, Calderón received broad support, both domestically and from abroad, for what was viewed as a brave, overdue, and necessary decision. Tangible results were predicted to come soon.
表面上，民主自卫似乎是合法的目标。 美国最高法院法官罗伯特·杰克逊（Robert Jackson，他也是纽伦堡审判美国主检察官）指出，宪法不是“自杀契约 ” 。	On the face of it, democratic self-defense seems a legitimate goal.
他们的画廊以一种非常明显和公开的方式向人们展示着他们的鉴赏力和判断力，这些能力是他们金融业务赖以的生存之道。	Nor was it simply a very expensive hobby. Their galleries showed in a visible and very public way the discernment and judgment that their financial business depended on.
在过去的几年中，世界经济最发达的国家的人们开始对中国、印度和其它拥有廉价劳力大军的新兴国家的经济实力极度担心。	Within the last few years, people throughout the world's most advanced economies have become acutely worried about the economic prowess of China, India, and other emerging countries with large low-wage populations.
伊拉克战争获得了五千亿美金的拨款—这一数额几乎等于过去一千年以来在基础研究方面所获得的全部资金支持。	Half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years.
但如今关于周永康命运的怀疑已经被打消 — — 近段时间以来中国媒体曝出一系列未受管制的新闻报道，披露了周永康家庭成员和前下属所涉及的令人震惊的腐败细节。	But doubts about Zhou’s fate have now been dispelled by a recent flurry of uncensored news stories in the Chinese media that revealed shocking details of corruption involving Zhou’s family and former subordinates.
如果美国不能刺激国内储蓄，那么中国资本告急可能迫使美国为外部融资支付更加高昂的代价 — — 可能是美元贬值或提高真实利率，或两者兼而有之。	To the extent that America fails to boost its domestic saving, the lack of Chinese capital may well force the US to pay a steeper price for external financing, through a weaker dollar, higher real interest rates, or both.
与外国所认识到的相反，中国只有少数媒体 — — 如《人民日报 》 、 《光明日报》和《经济日报 》 — —还依靠政府资金为生。	Contrary to foreign perceptions, only a handful of Chinese media – for example, People’s Daily, Guang Ming Daily, and the Economic Daily – still live on government funds.
过分简单化的意识形态将世界拖入了现在这场混乱当中，而同样过分简单化的拯救方案（即便是以“辣手仁心的紧缩”形式）也只会令问题更加复杂化。	Simplistic ideologies got the world into the mess in which it now finds itself, and simplistic prescriptions (even of the “tough-love austerity” form) will only compound the problems.
曾几何时被视为阿拉伯世界终极敌人和异教徒的以色列所取得的经济和军事成就长期以来被视为衡量阿拉伯世界失败的一种手段 — — 这既是充满感染力的仇恨也是心怀怨恨的钦佩的共同来源。	The economic and military achievements of Israel, once the Arab world’s ultimate enemy and infidel, were long viewed as a measure of Arab failure – a source of endemic hatred alloyed with grudging admiration.
过去三十年里，中国的企业合约实现了指数式增长。 由于国有企业在中国经济占据了主导地位，这给中国的企业合约带来了一些中国特色。	Chinese corporate contracts have grown exponentially over the last 30 years, but they have special characteristics that reflect the primary role of Chinese state-owned enterprises.
可以肯定，普京基本不可能再恢复苏联帝国在中东地区的荣光 — — 不仅因为俄罗斯维持其境外军事行动的能力依然极为有限。	To be sure, Putin is nowhere near securing a return to the Soviet Union’s imperial days in the Middle East – not least because Russia’s capacity to sustain a military operation beyond its borders remains severely limited.
尽管TPP的具体条款还没有公之于众，但成员国的政治领导人预测，该协议一旦被批准和实施，将给各国经济带来数千亿美元的提振并增加就业。	Though the TPP’s precise provisions have not been made public, political leaders in the member countries predict that the deal, once ratified and implemented, will add hundreds of billions of dollars to their economies and bolster employment.
在2013年和2014年，能源企业占了企业投资的主导地位，而该部门的削弱将转而导致相关就业岗位流失以及行业背后的制造商和服务企业需求下降。	In 2013 and 2014, energy firms dominated business investment, and cutbacks in the sector will translate into lost jobs and dropping demand for the manufacturers and service companies supplying the industry.
无可否认，新兴经济体的年均生产力增长需要提升57 % ， 也就是从2.8%上升到4.4 % ， 才能完全补偿由于人口构成变化所带来的负面效应。	To be sure, annual productivity growth in emerging economies would need to accelerate by 57%, from 2.8% to 4.4%, to compensate fully for the demographic shift.
事实上，大气中的温室气体的累积速度仍然很快，1.5℃的阈值很快就会被突破，突破之后，气候变化的一些最糟糕的效应就很难遏止了。	In fact, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are still accumulating at a rate that will soon take us well above the 1.5°C threshold, beyond which some of the worst effects of climate change cannot be staved off.
这不无道理，在常态时大体上正是如此，但如果各国主权财富基金为了应对突发不确定性和市场波动，从而出于外交和商业原因同时撤资，事情又会如何？	That is true, on average and in normal times, but what happens if many SWFs, responding to sudden uncertainty and volatility, pull back at the same time for diplomatic or commercial reasons?
如果这一情况持续，就会日益将欧洲分裂为“拥有 ” （ haves）和“无有 ” （ have-nots）两个阵营。	If it persists, it will reinforce the growing division of Europe into “haves” and “have-nots.”
其次，过去的经验一再表明弱势阶层必须得到保护；必须为有可能因新技术出现而失业的工人留出调整的时间和手段。	Second, past experience has repeatedly shown that disadvantaged classes must be protected; workers who are vulnerable to being displaced by technology must have the time and means to adjust.
作为一个宣布放弃研制和拥有核武器的国家，印度尼西亚一直在致力于防止核扩散的工作，以实现一个没有核武器威胁的安全世界。	As a declared non-nuclear weapon state, Indonesia has always striven for nuclear non-proliferation - indeed, for a world free of nuclear weapons.
而这份报告的重点正是奥巴马政府执政16个月以来所追求的政治目标 — — 对话、国际承诺、核不扩散以及裁军。	As with the politics pursued in the Obama administration’s 16 months of office – dialogue, international commitment, nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament – the document’s strength lies in the position that it takes.
相反如果回合谈判能圆满结束的话，除了上述的好处之外，那些世界上最贫穷的国家也将获得切实且重要的利益。	By contrast, if the Round is completed, aside from this generalized gain, specific and important improvements would benefit the world’s least developed countries.
即便发达国家和新兴经济体的增长都不如人意，即便东欧和中东的地缘政治危机不断升温，股票市场却似乎不闻不问地屡创新高。	Apparently unfazed by disappointing growth in both advanced and emerging economies, or by surging geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, equity markets have set record after record this year.
王毅已经在北京会见了到访的朝鲜副外相李吉成。 他将在3月18日会见美国国务卿蒂勒森，并就中国国家主席习近平与特朗普的首次会晤进行协调。	Wang has met with North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Ri Kil-song in Beijing, and he will meet with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on March 18, in an effort to coordinate a first meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump.
在日本方面，对中国强大经济和军事实力的忧虑与日俱增，以至于某些民族主义者想要尽快在对日本有利情况下把这件事“敲定”下来。	On the Japanese side, there is growing anxiety over China’s increasing economic and military prowess, such that some nationalists would like to “settle” the matter in Japan’s favor as soon as possible.
根据2010年联合国创新型经济报告，2002—2008年，创新性商品对的全球贸易以每年14%的速度增长。	According to a 2010 United Nations report on the creative economy, global trade in creative goods grew at an annual rate of 14% from 2002 to 2008.
按比例动作缩放 — — 该技术让机器手在小得多的规模上精确模拟外科医生的动作 — — 将能使外科医生操纵肉眼无法察觉的组织。	Motion scaling – which allows the robotic arms to mimic the exact movements of the surgeon’s hands, but on a much smaller scale – will enable surgeons to manipulate tissue that is too small for the naked eye to detect.
华盛顿—如今，美国所面临的主要金融风险与2007—2008年大麻烦的起因十分相似：大银行资产负债表上债务过多，股本过少。	WASHINGTON, DC – The main financial risk facing the United States today looks very similar to what caused so much trouble in 2007-2008: big banks with too much debt and too little equity capital on their balance sheets.
推进技术带来的教育挑战影响到每个人，因此各国应共同努力解决这些问题，包括通过学生和教师的交流以及信息通信技术基础设施的建设和升级。	The education challenges raised by advancing technologies affect everyone, so countries should work together to address them, including through exchanges of students and teachers and construction and upgrading of ICT infrastructure.
但英国政府却岿然不动，事后证明其遭受的羞辱所带来的心理和政治影响比英格兰银行所蒙受的财政损失所带来的还要重大。	But the UK government steered clear, with the psychological and political impact of its humiliation proving even more significant than the financial losses incurred by the BoE.
在过去的四分之一世纪里，该党有时似乎更注重赢得那些资本收益者 — — 而不是工薪阶层 — — 的支持。	Over the last quarter-century, the party has sometimes seemed more focused on winning the support of those who live on capital gains than those who live on wages.
事实上，巴西亚马逊地区的土著保留地在降低森林采伐率方面发挥了关键的作用 — — 并为此付出了相当大的代价。	Indeed, indigenous reserves in the Brazilian Amazon have played a critical role in lowering deforestation rates – at a considerable cost.
即便同情巴希尔的各国首脑们成功劝说联合国安理会延迟对其起诉—可能性极小—这些指控也会继续悬在巴希尔的头上挥之不去，除非（直到）他出庭受审。	Even if Bashir’s fellow heads of state succeed in their effort to persuade the United Nations Security Council to defer prosecution – which is highly unlikely – the charges will continue to hang over Bashir’s head unless and until he stands trial.
不幸的是，美国衰落的说法在近几年中获得了巨大的市场，就连美国官员也似乎已经开始相信它，推行弱势的零星政策（在有些问题上甚至无所作为 ） 。	Unfortunately, the narrative of American decline has gained so much traction in recent years that even US officials seem to have started to believe it, pursuing weak and piecemeal policies (or, in some cases, doing nothing at all).
日本也能为其赤字融资，尽管其公债水平已达天文数字。 这是因为它借钱用日元，且债权人绝大部分来自日本机构投资者。	Japan, too, can finance its deficits, despite astronomical public debt, because it borrows in yen – and overwhelmingly from Japanese institutional investors.
塞浦路斯人必须抓住这个机会建设一个健康、统一的国家，最大限度地发掘地区经济潜力，并且安全自信地在世界事务中发挥自身的作用。	Cypriots must seize this chance to build a healthy, reunited country that can make the most of its economic potential in the region, and play its part in world affairs with confidence and security.
通过释放Hadjiev并收回将其引渡回土库曼斯坦的威胁，保加利亚可以明确地显示其对履行自身义务的承诺。	By releasing Annadurdy Hadjiev from jail and withdrawing the threat of extradition to Turkmenistan, Bulgaria would unequivocally demonstrate its commitment to fulfilling its obligations.
在2008年11月举行的G-20峰会上，各国领袖们强烈谴责了贸易保护主义，并且承诺本国不会实行保护主义。	At their November 2008 summit the G-20 leaders strongly condemned protectionism and committed themselves not to engage in it.
像产量缺口在新凯恩斯主义推荐货币政策使用的指数中扮演着中心角色，这样一些无法观测的指数，大家都知道是很难被实时预测的。	Unobservable indicators like the output gap, which plays e.g. a central role in neo-keynesian recommendations for monetary policy, are generally known to be very difficult to estimate in real time.
让我们希望新的《改革条约》能够帮助使批评家确信欧盟将进入一个新的并且更积极的一体化阶段，并且条约能够为这一进程铺平道路。	Let us hope that the new Reform Treaty will help to reassure the critics and pave the way for a new – and more robust – phase of integration.
但认为贸易是零和博弈博弈的人根本就是在回避难题：应该由谁来承担贸易和新技术所造成的痛苦的错位（dislocation）成本？	But those who suggest that trade is a zero-sum game are simply avoiding the hard questions: Who should bear the painful dislocation costs from trade and new technologies?
但是，它没有坚持这一立场，将关于债务减免的争论引向德拉吉式的转移注意力战术，而是在几天之内就放弃了这一要求足。	But, instead of sticking to this position and turning a debate over debt forgiveness into a Draghi-style diversionary tactic, Greece abandoned this demand within days.
现在的IMF比过去要公正很多 — — 虽然它还可以做的更好一些。 这些措施还应该包括废除任何地区或国家任命IMF管理层的权利。	The IMF has, however, become far more neutral than it is given credit for – though it could take more steps to distance itself from its past.
但越来越多的人 — — 目前已接近3亿 — — 面临着城市贫民窟的严峻现实，这里资源紧缺，经济机会微乎其微。	But an increasing number of people – already nearly 300 million – are facing the harsh reality of the urban slum, where resources are scarce and economic opportunities are elusive.
阿富汗的未来同样无法确定，十多年的国际参与和援助都未能建立起一个有能力的政府，也未能平息塔利班及其他武装反对派。	Just as uncertain is the future of Afghanistan, where more than a decade of international involvement and assistance has failed to bring about a capable government or quell the Taliban and other armed opposition groups.
这将不可避免地引发多边机构中公平代表份额和治理的问题，以及该体系在大规模失衡的应对以及经济和政策绩效差异方面持续存在的偏向性。	This will inevitably raise issues of fair representation and governance in multilateral institutions, as well as the persistent bias in the system’s response to large imbalances and to divergence in economic and policy performance.
毫无疑问，马利基在要求美国提供一个严格的撤军时间表问题上表现出的强硬立场，是伊朗决定在背后助其一臂之力的关键因素。	No doubt Maliki’s hard-line stance on the need for a firm timetable for the withdrawal of US troops was critical to Iran’s decision to throw its weight behind him.
除了现金、选民以及游说集团，近几年来还发生了一些根本性变化让民主党感到恐慌：以色列与巴勒斯坦的冲突如今被美国右翼用来作为打击自由派的利器。	Cash, voters, and lobbies aside, something fundamental has changed in recent years, and this scares the Democrats: Israel’s conflict with Palestine is now being used by the American right as a cudgel to beat up liberals.
如果他当选，伊朗与P5+1（联合国理事会五大常任理事国加上德国）之间的核协议的未来将打上一个大大的问号。	Had he been elected, the future of the Iranian nuclear deal with the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany) might have been called into question.
TPP的原型可以追溯到甘利明加入谈判之前的2006年的所谓“太平洋4 ” （ P-4）贸易协定。 该协定只包括了新加坡、新西兰、智利和文莱。	The TPP’s origins, pre-dating Amari’s involvement, go back to a 2006 trade agreement among only Singapore, New Zealand, Chile, and Brunei – the so-called “Pacific 4.”
尽管有数百人丧生，更多人患病，但政府、非政府组织、当地社区 — — 包括红十字会运动支持的国家红十字会 — — 共同组织的集体响应还是遏制了疫情。	Although hundreds died and many more became sick, the collective response managed by governments, NGOs, and local communities, including the national Red Crescent Societies supported by the Red Cross movement, contained the disease.
谁知到了2010年，日本GDP还停留在479万亿日元的水平，同样的万亿票只能分发479日元的红利，相比最初收益并无多少起色，也令许多投资者深感失望。	In 2010, when GDP was still only ¥479 trillion, the same trills would pay a dividend of ¥479, not much larger than the initial yield and no doubt disappointing many investors.
戈尔的气候顾问，杰姆斯·汉森（James Hansen）认为，如果我们允许发展中国家“达到发达国家的水平，那么地球就完了 。 ”	Al Gore’s climate adviser, James Hansen, argues that if we allow developing countries to “come up to the level of the developed world, then the planet is done for.”
剧中的土著女英雄，最终成为主角恋人的内特丽说“你本不该来 ！ ” ，仿佛她在说这话时所面对的是所有的美国海外企业。	“You should not be here!” exclaims the indigenous heroine, and eventual love interest, Neytiri, as if she is speaking of the entire US enterprise overseas.
人人平等和拥有平等的权利的思想在很大程度上确实是出自西方文明史，从苏格拉底的“自然公正”到基督教教义再到法国的人权宣言无不传递这样的思想。	The ideal of universal equality and rights does owe something to the history of Western civilization, from Socrates’ “natural justice” to Christianity and France’s Declaration of the Rights of Man.
超低的借贷成本也刺激了对杠杆的过度依赖，弱化了提振潜在增长所需的改革意愿 — — 从而进​​一步加剧了经济遭遇利率或投资者情绪转变时的脆弱性。	Rock-bottom borrowing costs also spur excessive reliance on leverage, weakening the will to undertake reforms needed to boost potential growth – and further exacerbating the economy’s vulnerability to a shift in interest rates or investor sentiment.
如果埃塞俄比亚承认索马里兰独立，其他非盟国家很可能会纷纷仿效 — — 美国和欧盟成员国也有可能会跟进，拼命努力将索马里硬凑在一起让他们感到越来越绝望。	If Ethiopia were to recognize Somaliland as sovereign, other African Union countries would likely follow – and so, perhaps, would the United States and EU member states, which increasingly despair of patching Somalia together.
比如，在印尼，同性恋的社会容忍度很低，这是其封禁众多LGBTQ+网站的原因之一，虽然该国官方并不限制LGBTQ+权利。	In Indonesia, for example, low social tolerance for homosexuality may have played a role in the blocking of numerous LGBTQ+ websites, even though the country does not officially restrict LGBTQ+ rights.
去年的伦敦银行同业拆借利率丑闻揭露了银行为操纵金融工具价格而人为地扭曲 利率，这恰恰是上述风险的集中反映。	Last year’s LIBOR scandal, in which banks were found to be reporting inaccurate interest rates in order to manipulate the prices of financial instruments, epitomized this risk.
须知民粹主义并不是某个心怀恶意的外来势力强加于欧洲身上的；而是在欧洲内部有机地滋生，并在真实存在且广泛的不满情绪的推动下蔓延开来。	No malicious external actor is imposing populism on Europe; it has emerged organically, fueled by real and widespread grievances.
恢复还远没有结束，世界对这场灾难的反应体现了爱和热情，让我们深受感动，幸存者的坚毅精神和互助精神也让我们动容。	While the recovery is far from complete, the love and compassion reflected in the world’s response touched us deeply, as has the survivors’ spirit of perseverance and mutual aid to overcome hardship.
据政府自己的数据统计，它们只相当于GDP的1 % - -作为拉美税收最低的经济体之一，这点提高是微不足道的。	According to the government’s own figures, they equal just 1% of GDP – a pathetic increase in an economy with one of Latin America’s lowest tax takes.
现在假设您想继续持有委内瑞拉国债，因为您希望尼古拉斯·马杜罗总统下台，让位给一个更符合您道德取向也更明智的民主政府。	Now assume that you want to hold Venezuelan debt because you are hoping that President Nicolás Maduro will lose power and that a more sensible, democratically minded government, more in line with your moral compass, will emerge.
美联储的研究发现，在危机后时期，受高于预测的净投资组合流入（主要是债券流）推动，新兴经济体的总净资本流入高于预期。	The Fed study finds that emerging economies’ total net capital inflows have been higher than expected in the post-crisis period, driven by larger-than-predicted net portfolio inflows (mainly bond flows).
结果是，每年数以百万计的人死于没有新药可治的疾病，而药品公司却投入数十亿的资金来开发治疗勃起功能不良和脱发的药品。	As a result, millions of people die every year from diseases for which no new drugs are in the pipeline, while drug companies pour billions into developing cures for erectile dysfunction and baldness.
只有我们作出成绩出来，大家才会对欧盟选举感兴趣。 如果被选举出来的人只是来投反对票或是代表着欧洲黑暗势力的极端分子，那么整个欧洲民主的精神和进程都会蒙上阴影。	Unless we do that better, fewer people will vote for MEPs, more of them will be elected simply on a protest vote and represent Europe’s murky extremes, and the whole practice and principle of European democracy will be discredited.
大型金融公司早就买通了必要的政治保护（打着去监管化的旗号 ） ， 这使得它们不断壮大，也不断变得更危险。	Big financial firms can more readily buy the necessary political protection (in the form of deregulation), enabling them to become even bigger and more dangerous.
这些国家的当选领导人制定政策能力面临机制限制。 这些限制包括制衡行政的议会以及制衡前两者权力的法院。	Elected leaders in these countries face institutional constraints – parliaments that check the powers of the executive and courts that check the powers of both – on their ability to shape policy.
比如，斯大林崇拜 — — 普京身上颇可以找到一些斯大林的影子 — — 显然让许多俄罗斯人对镇压有了更大的接受度。	For example, the veneration of Stalin, with whom Putin shares more than a few traits, has no doubt contributed to many Russians’ greater willingness to accept repression.
环境税费 — — 如提高汽车注册费、污染费和改善公用设施成本覆盖 — — 也有所助益，还能同时纠正城镇环境问题。	Environmental charges and levies – such as higher registration fees for motor vehicles, pollution charges, and improved cost recovery on utilities – might also help, while simultaneously addressing urban environmental problems.
但是，多年以来，世界经济继续不停顿地增长，而在当前全球化的时代看似不可限量。 罗马俱乐部悲观的预计已经越发成为笑柄。	Over the years, however, as the world economy continued to grow without interruption – and, in the current age of globalization, seemingly without limits – the dire predictions of the Club of Rome have become increasingly an object of ridicule.
为了阻止记者报道当时的反对派领导人雷拉·奥丁加（Raila Odinga）所举行的示威，肯尼亚政府强迫三家私人电视台停播多日，完全无视法院停止播送管制的裁决。	To prevent journalists from reporting on a political rally by then-opposition leader Raila Odinga, the Kenyan government forced three private television stations off the air for days, ignoring court orders to end the blockade.
尽管没有重大金融传染风险，新政府与欧洲机构之间的谈判的持续而严重的破裂所导致的希腊危机复萌仍将是欧洲合作的巨大问题。	Despite the lack of significant financial contagion risk, a renewed Greek crisis, stemming from a lasting and serious breakdown of negotiations between the new government and EU institutions, would constitute a major problem for European cooperation.
但另一项安排将使用全球共同领土（如南极洲和其他“专属（国家）经济区”之外的区域）自然资源开采特许费。	Yet another scheme would deploy royalties for natural-resource extraction from the global commons, such as Antarctica and other areas beyond “exclusive [national] economic zones.”
为了避免严重的经济和社会冲击，保护至关重要的生态系统，我们急需将全球气温升高幅度限制在前工业化水平1.5℃以内。	To avoid severe economic and social shocks and protect essential ecosystems, we urgently need to limit the increase in global temperature to within 1.5° Celsius of the pre-industrial level.
但当今对美国的主要威胁其实并非来自于中俄，而是源自于特朗普打破了美国数十年来帮助建立和捍卫的国际秩序而引发的政策混乱局面。	But the principal threat to the US today does not come from China or Russia; it comes from the confusion characterizing its own policies, owing to Trump’s rejection of the very international order that the US helped forge and defend for decades.
但是，要保证欧洲的整体要大于各个部分之和，保证所有欧盟成员国之间的公平，所有欧盟国家都必须在欧盟政策的范围内活动，正如它们在乌克兰的问题上所做的一样。	However, to ensure that the European whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and to guarantee fairness to all Union members, all EU states must work within the parameters of EU policy, as they have in the case of Ukraine.
穆尔西承诺会尊重少数民族权利。 但其后旨在赋予他史无前例行政权力的行为却引发了人们对这些早期积极措施的忧虑。	Yet subsequent actions designed to give him unprecedented executive power raise concerns about these early positive steps.
而虽然海军部署有时无法制止冲突，它们却是对任何危机的军事回应中不可或缺的部分，也是维护欧洲安全的关键。	And yet, while naval deployments do not always end conflicts, they are a vital component of the military response to any crisis, and are critical to guaranteeing Europe’s security.
决策者同样必少不了与美国的跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系 — — 这对创造大西洋两岸的就业机会起到关键作用。	The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States is another imperative for policymakers – one that is key to creating jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.
无论怎样，中美洲民主一直伴随着经济开放政策和吸引外资的努力，2005年《中美自由贸易协定》的签署使这种努力达到了高潮。	For better or for worse, democracy in the region has been accompanied by policies of economic liberalisation and efforts to attract foreign investment, culminating in the signing of the Central American Free Trade Agreement with the US in 2005.
特别是，我们认为三个领域 — — 技术、激励和看似“非卫生”投资 — — 都有可能大大推动全民医疗覆盖。	In particular, we believe that three areas – technology, incentives, and seemingly “non-health” investments – have the potential to advance universal health coverage dramatically.
此外，尽管合成肥料的主要成分 — — 氮可以用生物方法可持续地生产，但这种生产方法不利于一小撮权势肥料生产商和分销商的利益。	And, though their main component, nitrogen, could be produced biologically and sustainably, that would run counter to the interests of a handful of powerful fertilizer producers and distributors.
最后，那些有权制定和执行欧盟财政和货币规则的人都完全明白如果意大利爆发一次希腊式危机，那么欧元区也会跟着完蛋。	At the end of the day, those with the power to set and enforce EU fiscal and monetary rules know full well that the eurozone could not survive a Greek-style crisis in Italy.
不具代表性的治理机构会增加不确定性和受其决策影响群体的沮丧感，破坏其行动合法性 — — 从而降低效率。	A governing body that is not representative fuels uncertainty and frustration among those subject to its decisions, undermining the legitimacy – and thus the effectiveness – of its actions.
事实上，有人认为收入不平等性推动经济增长，而再分配转移支付削弱工作激励，反过来抑制生产率、降低投资，最终伤及整个社会。	Indeed, some contend that income inequality drives economic growth and that redistributive transfers weaken the incentive to work, in turn depressing productivity, reducing investment, and ultimately harming the wider community.
为获取专利，申请人必须证明某一项发明符合新面世、非显见（其中涉及发明步骤）和具备实用价值（即发明能起到所称的作用）等项条件。	To obtain a patent, an applicant must demonstrate that an invention meets three criteria: newness, non-obviousness (that there is an inventive step), and utility (the invention does what it claims to do).
美国的金融企业利润中34%要缴税，此外尽管它们可以把向债权人支付的利息从应税所得中扣除，但股本仍需要纳税。	Financial firms in the United States pay about 34% of their profits in taxes, and, while they can deduct interest payments to creditors from taxable income, equity is not taxed as favorably.
一个误导性的修辞得到了一字不差地执行，引发了多个战线的真实战争，包括伊拉克、加沙、黎巴嫩、阿富汗和索马里。	A misleading figure of speech has been applied literally to unleash a real war on several fronts, including Iraq, Gaza, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Somalia.
我们怎么能够接受法国人因其犹太身份而遭到杀戮 ？ ” 之后他警告法国反犹主义（比方说把大屠杀写入法国教科书所引发的担忧）的复兴显示民主已经陷入危机。	He then warned that the revival of anti-Semitism in France – apparent, for example, in the anxiety over the Holocaust’s inclusion in the French school curriculum – indicates a crisis of democracy.
类似地，尽管压低就业是提振生产率的一种办法，但这隐含着高昂的宏观经济成本，如岁入损失和更高的社会支出。	Likewise, while reducing employment is one way to boost productivity, it implies high macroeconomic costs in terms of lost revenues and higher social spending.
与拿两三项设计供RCT慢慢测试（就像在学校里使用平板电脑或挂图）不同，大部分社会干预存在数百万种设计可能性，其结果取决于这些可能性之间的复杂组合。	As opposed to the two or three designs that get tested slowly by RCTs (like putting tablets or flipcharts in schools), most social interventions have millions of design possibilities and outcomes depend on complex combinations between them.
1978年，在阿拉木图举行的国际初级医疗会议（International Conference on Primary Health Care）上，134个国家签署了一份宣言，要求到2000年让所有人都得到充足的医疗 。 。	In 1978, at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma-Ata, 134 states signed a declaration calling for adequate health care for all by the year 2000.
但尽管结核病和NCD属于截然不同的健康威胁，应对它们的最佳手段是一样的：我们必须构建更强大的卫生体系，实现全民健康覆盖（UHC ） 。	But while TB and NCDs are very different types of health threats, the best response to them is the same: We must build stronger health systems that are capable of delivering universal health coverage (UHC).
因此，设立一个法律框架，给所有国家制定明确共同的规则是至关重要的，也是我们唯一能够获得的确保实施保护最脆弱国家措施的办法。	So, having a legal framework with clear and common rules to which all countries are committed is critically important – and the only assurance we have that action will be taken to protect the most vulnerable.
马万达马位于深受贫困困扰的非洲南部国家马拉维，那里再一次勾起了我年轻时对农村贫困的挑战和艰难的回忆。	As in my youth, I saw once again the challenges and hardship of rural poverty.
但现实是官僚体系及其特权网在改革过程中不仅成了最大的既得利益，而大量的官员腐败还形成了非源于市场的第二种不平等。	But the bureaucracy and its privileged networks benefited most, and a second, non-market source of inequality – endemic official corruption – became entrenched.
除了略微降低每年的增长目标至6 % ， 当局必须提供更多的货币和财政支持以抵消可以预料到的投资、消费和政府支出的放缓。	Beyond setting a slightly lower growth target of 6% per year, the authorities must provide more monetary and fiscal support to offset the expected slowdown in investment, consumption, and government expenditures.
比如，全球收入平等对国家政治领袖来说就不是一个可信的义务，但同样是这位领袖，他可以声称应该做更多事减少全世界的贫困和疾病，以此招徕追随者。	Global income equalization, for example, is not a credible obligation for a national political leader; but such a leader could rally followers by saying that more should be done to reduce poverty and disease worldwide.
罗马俱乐部想象在田园诗般的过去，我们没有悬浮颗粒空气污染，都是快乐的农民，而在未来，暖气烟囱将让我们无法呼吸。 现实与此完全相反。	Whereas the Club of Rome imagined an idyllic past with no particulate air pollution and happy farmers, and a future strangled by belching smokestacks, reality is entirely the reverse.
比如，胡佛大坝（Hoover Dam）创造了美国最大的水库米德湖（Lake Mead ） ， 它建于大萧条期间，是罗斯福新政的一部分。	The Hoover Dam, for example, which created Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, was built in 1936 during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal.
此外，以个人社会责任取代企业社会责任还有一个好处：因为其优势在于可以利用多种途径来具体实现利他主义。	There is also an added advantage in replacing CSR with PSR: there is virtue in diversity of approaches to altruism.
但他们都能通过向各自的叙利亚客户释放相同的信号 — — 即排除一方对另一方的军事胜利 — — 来改善局面。	But all of them could improve conditions for negotiations by sending the same message to their respective Syrian clients, namely that they henceforth exclude a military victory by one side over the other.
丹佛—一位反对朝鲜和伊朗的俄罗斯高级外交官曾经对我说 ： “ 朝鲜半岛就像是一对旗鼓相当的邻家对头小孩。	DENVER – A senior Russian diplomat, in contrasting North Korea and Iran, once said to me: “The North Koreans are like neighborhood children with matches.
六个月的学习费用 — — 不管你学多少门课 — — 是2,890美元（包括教材费和一名导师的费用 ） ， 与大部分州立大学比起来十分便宜。	The cost for six months, regardless of how many courses a person takes, is $2,890 (including books and a mentor) – a bargain, compared to most state universities.
波兰在过去20年之所以能取得成功，一个关键因素就是在后共产主义转型初始就在政治和商业间实现了明确的区分。	A key ingredient of Poland’s success in the last 20 years was a clear separation, from the very beginning of the post-communist transition, between politics and business.
毕竟伊朗不需要铀浓缩技术：这个国家只有一个民用核反应堆，作为燃料的铀棒可以由俄罗斯提供，而伊朗目前正在发展的相关技术也无法应用在这个反应堆上。	After all, Iran does not need uranium-enrichment technology. The country has only one civilian nuclear reactor, with fuel rods supplied by Russia, and the Iranian technology now being developed cannot be used in it.
早些时候，夹在中印之间的缅甸叫停了中国支持的密松大坝的建设，但它有朝一日极有可能成为促进两个大国经济联系的节点。	Sandwiched between China and India, Myanmar, which had earlier suspended construction of the Chinese-backed Myitsone Dam, may one day be the link that facilitates closer economic ties between the two giants.
只要和谈过程开始，强大的既得利益就会开始 — — 暴力地 — — 搞破坏，因为和平协议将破坏他们的权力基础和他们可以从继续冲突中获得的政治支持。	As soon as the process begins, powerful vested interests are likely to disrupt it – violently – because a peace agreement would undermine their power base and the political support that they derive from continuing the conflict.
现在，许多与这些政策有关联的前官员们（如前信息部长穆萨希德·侯赛因）也承认巴基斯坦本应该早就遏制住了交战状态。	Today, many former officials associated with those policies, such as Mushahid Hussain, a former information minister, concede that Pakistan should have contained militancy long ago.
首先，针对妇女和儿童的家庭暴力每年耗费8万亿美元的社会成本，使之成为巨大 — — 而且被严重低估的全球性问题。	First, domestic violence against women and children imposes a social cost of $8 trillion each year, making it a huge – and vastly underreported – global issue.
2008年经济危机后，欧洲引入了“扭转多数规则 ” ， 根据这一规则，欧盟委员会的任何罚款建议都是最终建议，除非欧盟财政部长们以三分之二多数反对。	After the 2008 economic crisis, Europe introduced a “reverse majority rule,” under which any Commission proposal to impose a fine is final, unless EU finance ministers can muster a two-thirds majority against it.
莫斯科 — — 俄罗斯的民间团体机构面对着比世界其他国家更多的挑战，而全世界民间团体所面临的挑战有很多相似之处。	MOSCOW – The challenges facing civil-society organizations are greater in Russia than in many parts of the world, but the challenges facing civil society itself are similar everywhere.
虽然我们无法确切知道会发生什么，但审慎的做法莫过于打起精神迎接另一次下坠 — — 同时竭尽所能，避免车毁人亡。	While we cannot know for sure what will happen, it would be prudent to brace ourselves for another drop – and do what we can to avoid a crash.
但印度、巴基斯坦和尼日利亚等高致死率国家的政治精英 — — 也就是在SDG上签字的那些人 — — 显然没能兑现承诺。	Yet political elites in high-mortality countries like India, Pakistan, and Nigeria – the same elites who have signed up to the SDGs – have conspicuously failed to deliver.
但这种方法会形成一种自我局限的模式，因为资产负债表受到了损坏，需求得不到提振，而预期不得不向下修正。	But this approach establishes a self-limiting pattern, because balance sheets are damaged, demand falters, and expectations have to be adjusted downward.
但他的治国风格属于哲学家以赛亚·柏林所谓的自由派狐狸（知道很多事 ） ， 而不是柏林所谓的刺猬（知道一样大事 ） 。	Yet he governed in the style of the philosopher Isaiah Berlin’s liberal fox, who knows many things, as opposed to Berlin’s hedgehog, who knows one big thing.
美联储有全球责任，是因为两个关系紧密的原因，这两个原因都和避免巴西前财政部长曼特加（Guido Mantega）深深忧虑的“货币战争”的需要没什么关系。	The Fed has global responsibilities for two closely related reasons, neither of which has much to do with the need to avoid the “currency wars” that so concerned former Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega.
事实上，普京的权力基石 — — 也就是他在一代人时间里苦苦建立起来的依恃主义的经济模式 — — 已经成为他政治生存的主要威胁。	In fact, the bedrock of Putin’s power – the clientelist economic arrangements that he has assiduously consolidated over the past generation – has become the main threat to his political survival.
来自企业方面的调查数据显示，近三个月流失的工作岗位约有60万个；而来自家庭方面 — — 其中包括自由职业者和小企业主 — — 的调查结果则表明，工作岗位流失的数量超过200万。	And, while data from firms suggest that job losses in the last three months were about 600,000, household surveys, which include self-employed workers and small entrepreneurs, suggest that those losses were above two million.
尽管一些人警告科技进步将让许多人失业，但其他人仍相信被替代的工人能够在从前不存在的岗位上找到新工作，一如过去所发生的那样。	While some warn that technological progress will leave many unemployed, others remain convinced that displaced workers will find new jobs that do not yet exist, as has occurred in the past.
一开始，人们找不到以什么为基础来对它们进行理性的重新估价，因为所发生的事件（美国房价在和平时期下跌）是前所未有的。	Initially, there was little basis for re-pricing them rationally, because the event (a peacetime decline in US house prices) was unprecedented.
他们似乎并不在意艾森豪威尔从未采取任何措施阻止苏联坦克镇压1956年匈牙利起义，也不在意里根无意支持反对波兰共产主义政权的团结工会积极份子。	Never mind that Eisenhower did nothing to stop Soviet tanks from crushing the Hungarian uprising in 1956, or that Reagan had no intention of supporting Solidarity activists when they rose against Poland’s communist regime.
如果有一本书告诉你说经济预测最好交由电脑模型去完成，而作为一个普通读者，你必须拥有一个博士学位才能搞懂这些模型，那该是多么沉闷乏味啊。	It is no fun to read a book or article that says that economic forecasting is best left to computer models that you, the general reader, would need a Ph.D. to understand.
这一进步是无可争议的;但是为了避免描画得过于美好，我们也应该考虑全球不平等状况，因为自1950年以来世界各国就没有显示出任何向着一个共有的繁荣水平靠拢的迹象。	This is indisputable progress of one kind; but, to avoid painting too rosy a picture, we should also consider global inequality. The world’s countries have shown no sign since 1950 of converging at a shared level of prosperity.
上个月，中国宣布了一项5860亿美元的经济刺激计划，其中大约25%的资金将用于帮助支持环境保护以及在可再生能源方面的努力。	Last month, China announced a $586 billion economic stimulus package, some 25% of which is to help bolster conservation, environmental protection, and renewable energy efforts.
但是，随着贸易自由化降低了关税，贸易税的比重有所降低，���其他收入源又不足以补偿贸易税收入的下降。	But, as trade liberalization has lowered tariffs and duties, the share of trade taxes has declined, while other sources have not compensated for falling trade revenue.
欧盟，特别是有19个成员的欧元区，因此就成为德国巨大的基地（home base ） ， 供它发动对外国市场的进攻。	The EU, especially the 19-member eurozone, thus functions as a vast home base for Germany, from which it can launch its assault on foreign markets.
在欧元区，风险因其主要的宏观审慎工​​具 — — 稳定与增长公约 — — 在限制各国支出上的无能而加剧，因为更低的利率给了债务国增加支出的空间。	In the eurozone’s case, the risk is compounded by the ineffectiveness of its key macroprudential instrument, the Stability and Growth Pact, in limiting countries’ spending, as lower interest rates give debtor countries leeway to spend more.
种姓是无比强大的自我认同，成为印度选举民主中极有用的政治动员工具：印度人的选票常常投给同一种姓的候选人。	Because caste was such a powerful source of self-identification, it proved to be a useful tool for political mobilization in India’s electoral democracy: When Indians cast their vote, they too often vote their caste.
但从那以后它就静静躺在纽约联合国开发计划署阿拉伯发展局的抽屉里，很大部分原因可能是由于对阿拉伯权力精英的严厉批评。	But it has lain in the drawers of the UNDP Arab Bureau in New York ever since, probably in no small part due to its harsh judgment of the Arab power elite.
比如说，一个学生只需运用第一学期所学的公式就能完美解释陀螺仪的运作特性；随后工程师们就可以着手制造旋转罗盘来引导飞机或导弹飞向指定目标。	For example, one needs only first-semester equations to describe reasonably well the behavior of a gyroscope; engineers can then go off and build gyrocompasses that guide aircraft or missiles to their destinations.
债权国纳税人的钱为什么非得用来担起为欧元危机融资的责任，特别是在高私人财富/GDP的原因可能正是长期以来的低税，而低私人财富/GDP则是高税的反映的情况下？	Why should taxpayers in creditor countries have to take responsibility for financing the euro crisis, especially given that high private wealth/GDP ratios may result from low tax revenues over time, while lower ratios may reflect higher tax revenues?
因此以色列实现和平的战略总是在两种愿景之间振荡：左派将巴勒斯坦为题视为当务之急，而右翼则倾向于寻求与阿拉伯大国之间的协议。	The Israeli strategy of peacemaking therefore oscillates between two visions: while the Israeli left gives priority to the Palestinian problem, the Israeli right prefers pursuing a settlement with the big Arab powers.
通过研究心理、文化、生物、历史和遗传学领域的相互影响和共同进化，我们有可能取得人类心理学领域的重要突破。	By examining the rich interaction and co-evolution of psychology, culture, biology, history, and genetics, we have the possibility to gain important insights into human psychology.
经合组织国际学生评估项目（Program for International Student Assessment）标准差评分每前进一位，意味着���国增加2%的长期人均增长率。	One step up the standard deviation score on the OECD’s Program for International Student Assessment is associated with a 2% increase in a country’s long-run per capita growth rate.
这一德国式欧洲改革思维的批评者可能会不无道理地问，为何人们应该履行他们的理性职责，而不在经受时间考验的狭隘自利的老路上一直走下去？	A critic of this German idea for reforming Europe might credibly ask why anyone should do their rational duty, rather than remain on the time-honored path of narrow self-interest?
更令人担忧的是，如果叙利亚工程师在建有实验室，或在其他叛军控制地区建有实验室从核反应堆乏燃料中提取铀，则叛军甚至可能已经获得了制造原子弹的原料。	Far more worrying, had Syrian engineers built a lab at the site, or in other rebel-held territory, to extract plutonium from the reactor’s spent fuel, the insurgents might even have found themselves with the ingredients of an atomic bomb.
梅关于同时追求退欧协议和贸易协议的承诺 — — 并且两者都要在退欧过程（她宣称将从3月底启动）开始两年内完成 — — 也非常不现实。	May’s promise to pursue an exit deal and a trade deal simultaneously – and both within two years of the formal start of the withdrawal process (which she aims to initiate by the end of March) – is similarly unrealistic.
类似地，联合国日内瓦裁军会议通过的《化学武器公约》至今仍是人们谈成的最有力的有关大规模杀伤性武器的武装管制条约。	Likewise, the Chemical Weapons Convention, steered through the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, is still the most robust arms-control treaty related to weapons of mass destruction ever negotiated.
在多元化民主模式下生活多年的西方人可能很难理解这一举措对于一个50多年持续处于军事统治下的国家来说是一次多么巨大的转变。	Westerners used to pluralistic democracy may find it hard to understand what a potentially huge shift this will be in a country accustomed to military rule for over 50 years.
《营商环境报告》是世界银行为数不多的成功领域之一，过去十年录得近2000项改革，并已证明是发展中经济体决策者刺激改革、强化投资的有力工具。	The project has been a rare World Bank success, recording almost 2,000 reforms over the past decade, and has proved to be a valuable tool for policymakers in developing economies to spur reform and enhance investment.
到1982年时美元兑德国马克的汇率上涨了50 % ； 到里根第一任任期结束时其价值实际上已经翻了一番。	By 1982, it had risen by half against the Deutsche Mark; and by the end of Reagan’s first term in office, it had actually doubled in value.
共和党试图吐出美国劳动阶级的心声 — — 境况越来越差，而政府支出越来越大，同时也试图代表劳动致富的富人表达心中的愤怒。 他们知道，维系选民支持比捍卫原则容易多了。	Republicans, trying to give voice to many working Americans’ ambient uneasiness with rising government expenditures, as well as to the growing anger of the working rich, find it easier to defend a principle than a particular constituency.
而这些存在于现代化大生产之前的淘汰行业之所以能存在，就是因为互联网降低了分散作业的成本 — — 须知这些工作过去只能被迫集中于工厂和办公室中完成。	This throwback to the cottage industries that preceded modern production is possible today because the Internet is lowering the costs of dispersion that once compelled the concentration of work in factories and offices.
他总是把对“无意义”和平谈判的批评挂在嘴边，在到访德黑兰时还许诺哈马斯的“抵抗”将持续到“所有巴勒斯坦土地都得到解放的那一天 ” 。	He missed no opportunity to criticize “futile” peace negotiations, and, in Tehran, he pledged that Hamas’s “resistance” would continue “until all Palestinian land has been liberated.”
俄罗斯的权力架构与美国的一样，必须进行调整以便进行一场长期的斗争。 这与老一套的苏联克格勃压制不同政见的方式完全不同。	Russia's power structures, like those of America, must now be readied to conduct a very long struggle, entirely different from the old Soviet KGB way of suppressing dissent.
尽管他宣称如果真的是沙特杀害了卡绍吉，将采取“严厉惩罚 ” ， 但他拒绝取消军备合同，而是哀叹这会给美国就业带来多少损失。	Though he vowed “severe punishment” if the Saudis did indeed kill Khashoggi, he refused to countenance canceling military contracts, instead lamenting what their loss would mean for American jobs.
反对创造欧洲单一货币然后允许希腊作弊获得欧元区成员资格的批评可以在20世纪90年代很有道理 — — 理论上，它们至今仍然如此。	The arguments against creating a European single currency and then allowing Greece to cheat its way into membership were valid back in the 1990s – and, in theory, they still are.
如果你胆敢要一个大盘子或者额外的帮助，服务小姐便会给你一个俄罗斯式的厌烦眼神 ― ― 你要得太多了。	If you dare to ask for a bigger plate or an extra helping, the waitress gives you that withering Soviet look - you want too much.
如果罗塞夫采取这一政策，巴西将与墨西哥一起稳定2015年的拉丁美洲，帮助该地区克服低油价扰动委内瑞拉经济带来的破坏效应。	If she delivers, Brazil would join Mexico in anchoring a more stable Latin America in 2015, helping the region to overcome the disruptive effects of a Venezuelan economy roiled by lower oil prices.
后苏联时代，古拉格不为多数人知晓的最引人注目的纪念碑是500卢布纸币，它发行于20世纪90年代末，直到今天依然被广泛使用。	The most arresting but unrecognized of all post-Soviet monuments to the Gulag is the 500 ruble banknote, issued in the late 1990's and widely used today.
在美国，以及西班牙和爱尔兰，银行和家庭成为《金融时报》专栏作家马丁·沃尔夫（Martin Wolf）所谓的“固定资产的高杠杆投机者 ” 。	In the US, as well as in Spain and Ireland, banks and households became what the Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf called “highly leveraged speculators in a fixed asset.”
没有哪个国家能像塞浦路斯那样从土耳其实现稳定民主中获取那么大的好处，而在邻国分崩离析环境下的去民主化的土耳其将严重威胁塞浦路斯和欧洲的利益。	No country would gain more than Cyprus from stable democracy in Turkey, whereas a de-democratizing Turkey in an unraveling neighborhood seriously threatens Cypriot and European interests alike.
这一一体化方法在实体经济与金融部门紧密相连的国家或许会见效，它能确保政策及时、有序地实施，同时防止消极溢出效应。	This integrated approach could prove effective in countries where the real economy and the financial sector are closely linked, ensuring the timely, orderly implementation of policies, while preventing adverse spillovers.
不过，短期内必须执行非常强硬的货币和财政政策（传统的和非传统的 ） ， 从而确保滞缩不会延续到2010年及其之后，虽然2009年已经无法避免这次滞缩。	Nevertheless, in the short run, very aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions – both traditional and non-traditional – must be undertaken to ensure that the inevitable stag-deflation of 2009 does not persist into 2010 and beyond.
日本的军事潜力和政策的渐进式变化虽然是必要的和有效的，但也只能建立在对其国防利益的全民共识的基础之上。	But these incremental changes in Japan's military capacity and policies, though necessary and effective, can be sustained only with a clear national consensus on the country's defense interests.
还有像卢克·费里和伊曼纽尔·托德那样的知识分子，他们认为破坏者如此轻而易举地靠近、攻陷和洗劫凯旋门可能并不是“偶然”的。	And there the intellectuals who, in the manner of Luc Ferry and Emmanuel Todd, suggest that it was perhaps not “by chance” that the wreckers had such an easy time approaching, storming, and sacking the Arc de Triomphe.
这份报告发表两周前，台风海燕（当地称之为Yolanda）摧毁了菲律宾独鲁万（Tacloban）地区。	The report was released just weeks after Typhoon Haiyan (or Yolanda as it was known locally) tore through the Tacloban region in the Philippines.
而富裕国家确实有道义上的责任去带头和更快地行动起来 — — 利用其政策，科技和金融 — — 以减少导致全球变暖的排放量。	And the rich world does have a moral obligation to move first and faster – with policies, technologies, and finance – to reduce the emissions that cause global warming.
与希特勒不同，查韦斯在经济假象破灭之前就去世了，这使得人们更倾向于谴责马杜罗而不是与查韦斯主义 — — 当前灾难的意识形态根源 — — 划清界限。	Unlike Hitler, Chávez died before the economic mask came off, making it easier to denounce Maduro without coming to terms with Chavismo – the ideology underpinning the current disaster.
领馆官员并不享有与高级外交官同等的豁免权，因此虽然手段（比方说对科巴拉加德进行脱衣搜查）可能有越轨之嫌，但警方并未越权行事。	Because consular officials do not enjoy the same degree of immunity as higher-ranking diplomats, the police were acting within their authority, even if their methods – strip-searching Khobragade, for example – might be considered excessive.
即使是最保守的联邦预算赤字估计也认为，已经饱受抑制的净国民储蓄率可能在2018—2019年间的某个时点重新滑入负区间。	Even the most conservative estimates of the federal budget deficit suggest that the already-depressed net national saving rate could re-enter negative territory at some point in the 2018-2019 period.
由什叶派政治势力统治的伊朗也密切关注着叙利亚局势。 土耳其亦然，直到最近，叙利亚一直是该国地区政策的关键着眼点。	Iraq, governed by Shia political forces, also keeps close tabs on Syria’s evolution, as does Turkey, which, until fairly recently, considered Syria a keystone of its regional policy.
与此同时，无论生产率如何增长，以比特币计算的名义工资实际上将永远增长，进一步增加了爆发经济灾难的可能性。	At the same time, nominal wages in Bitcoin would increase forever in real terms, regardless of productivity growth, adding further to the likelihood of an economic disaster.
但欧洲的反应，就如同美国在其它事件上的反应一样，凸显了联合国和更广泛国际机构的支持者们所遭遇的一些关键性问题。	But Europe’s response, like the US response in other cases, highlights a critical issue for all supporters of the UN and international institutions more generally.
美还将加大援助力量解决巴勒斯坦难民问题，包括巴勒斯坦境内、其他阿拉伯国家境内以及以色列出于人道主义原因批准的在其境内的特殊地区。	Help would also be extended to settle the Palestinian refugees, whether in Palestine, other Arab countries, or, in special cases where Israel agrees for humanitarian reasons, in Israel itself.
但欧洲央行并未因此重新思考其战略，而是开始考虑双倍下注：购买更多债券，并进一步将其基准利率降为负值，而这将酿成大错。	But instead of rethinking its strategy, the ECB is considering doubling down: buying even more bonds and lowering its benchmark interest rate even further into negative territory. This would be a serious mistake.
在著名期刊拥有高出版率的学者和科研机构效率得分较高，进而在职业生涯发展和研究经费支持方面得到更多奖励。	Scholars and institutions with high publishing rates in the established journals receive better productivity scores, which translate into bigger rewards, in terms of enhanced careers and greater research funding.
必须时刻铭记一个简单的现实：始于第二次世界大战后欧洲一体化工程给欧洲大部带来了近四分之三个世纪的前所未有的稳定与繁荣。	A simple reality must be kept in mind: The European integration project that began in the wake of World War II has helped to bring unprecedented stability and prosperity to much of the continent for nearly three-quarters of a century.
毕竟在谷歌、维基百科、Skype、推特、脸书、YouTube、位智（Waze ） 、 Yelp（点评网站 ） 、 Hipmunk（机票预订网站 ） 、 Pandora（定制电台）等其他许多公司的帮助下我们的生活效率和生产力比过去提高了许多。	After all, our lives have been made dramatically more productive thanks to Google, Wikipedia, Skype, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Waze, Yelp, Hipmunk, Pandora, and many other companies.
显然，避免彻底冲突符合所有行动方的利益，因此我们看到了中国国家主席习近平与日本首相安倍晋三上个月在北京貌合神离地握了手。	Because it is so obviously in every player’s interest to avoid outright conflict, we have stony handshakes like that between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Beijing last month.
以色列并不打算将来宣布拥有这片土地，以前从来也没有从那里得到任何经济利益，现在将留守在那里视为一个安全问题，而不是一个资产。	Israel does not intend to claim this land in the future, never derived any economic benefit from it, and now regards staying there as a security problem rather than an asset.
但法国还需要更复杂的结构改革，其中最紧迫的改革是放松和简化复杂的劳动法。 目前的劳动法让雇用和解雇员工过于困难。	But France also needs more complex structural reforms, the most urgent one being liberalization and simplification of the country’s complex labor code, which makes it too difficult to hire and lay off workers.
即便缓慢增长的经济以及更智能机器的劳动替代作用也削弱了对高技能高分析能力职业的需求，但这些差距在最近十年依然存在。	These differences have persisted in the most recent decade, even though tepid economic growth and labor displacement by smarter machines have weakened demand for high-skill, high-cognition occupations.
美国必须在情报、武器和实施干涉的政治意愿方面做好准备 — — 如有必要甚至单方面采取行动 — — 以阻止伊朗核计划，如果伊朗真的试图追随朝鲜的脚步。	The US must be prepared, in terms of intelligence, weapons, and political will, to intervene – unilaterally, if needed – to stop Iran, should it try to follow in North Korea’s footsteps.
这一金融承诺从根本上说只是象征性的，但却是首尔G-20领导人峰会所达成的更大的协议 — — 改变IMF的出资结构，让新兴经济体用有更大的代表权 — — 的一部分。	The financial commitment was essentially symbolic, but it was part of a larger agreement reached at the Seoul Summit of G-20 leaders to regularize the IMF’s resources and enhance the representation of emerging economies.
公共领域中人们的背景非常多元化，但却奉行共同的价值观甚至讲同样的语言，而人们的私生活却－用个不太好听的字眼来形容－形形色色。	The public space is multicultural in terms of people's backgrounds, but is governed by agreed values, even a common language, whereas the people's private lives are - to use an ugly word - ghettoized.
随着国际政治逐渐演变为竞争信誉的游戏，在学生和年轻领导者之间建立个人关系的交流计划往往成为软实力最有效的创造活动。	With international politics becoming a game of competitive credibility, exchange programs that develop personal relations among students and young leaders are often far more effective generators of soft power.
此外，两党在某些政策上还存在着巨大分歧，自由党人总是把政治改革放在议程的第一位，以便建立一个对它们有利的选举体制。	Moreover, there are substantial policy differences between the two parties, with Liberals placing political reform at the top of their agenda, in order to establish an electoral system that would suit them better.
而谈判的场合也是现成的：1945年，为了给在战争与和平之间来回摇摆的世界谈判解决办法而成立的联合国安理会。	And there is a venue for this: the UN Security Council, created in 1945 to negotiate solutions when the world hovers between war and peace.
一个很有希望的创新是“盒中电站”项目。 这是一个模块化、可扩展的迷你电网方案，目前正在印度和其他国家进行现场测试。	One promising innovation is a “utility in a box” system – a modular, scalable mini-grid solution that is currently being field-tested in India and elsewhere.
不仅如此，有几家极右翼组织支持菲永在初选期间的竞选资格，因为他对旨在禁止布基尼（即穆斯林女性穿着的全身泳衣）的立法持坚定的支持态度。	Meanwhile, a number of far-right organizations supported Fillon’s candidacy during the primaries, owing to his strong support for laws that would ban the burkini, a full-body bathing suit worn by Muslim women.
另一方面，你们的经常项目盈余在2007年达到了峰值，占GDP的10 % ， 而现在只占GDP的1.3 % 。	On the other hand, your current-account surplus peaked at 10% of GDP in 2007, and now stands at a mere 1.3% of GDP.
例如，由于工资集中谈判，意大利南部私营部门的平均薪酬仅比北部低6 % ， 而北部的生产率则远远领先于南部。	For example, as a result of centralized wage bargaining, average private-sector compensation is just 6% lower in Italy’s South than in the North, even though the North’s productivity lead over the South is far greater.
除了战略优势之外，美国与这些石油酋长国（也是世界上外汇储备最为庞大的一些国家）的亲密关系也为美元撑了腰。	In addition to the strategic advantages, America’s close ties with the oil sheikhdoms – which are among the world’s leading holders of foreign-exchange reserves – contribute to propping up the dollar.
幸而借助共同的历史和使命感，再加上一点幽默，我们共同做到这一点，我和查韦斯之间的私人关系也逐渐从对立变得亲切。	And thanks to a sense of shared history and purpose, not to mention a little humor, we were able to do just that, with our personal relations gradually shifting from antagonistic to cordial.
当巴基斯坦方面提议会晤印度克什米尔分离主义领导人时，双方外长之间的会谈被取消 — — 巴基斯坦会晤克什米尔分离主义领袖是一种普遍做法，之前印度政府的回应大都是官方的漠不关心。	Talks between their respective foreign ministers were called off when the Pakistanis proposed meeting Indian Kashmiri separatist leaders – a common practice, to which earlier Indian governments had responded with official indifference.
在2010年，参加东盟区域论坛的部长们利用一个简化的标准格式扩大了展望的范围，���中包括公布国家国防方针，国防支出以及各国武装部队总兵力。	In 2010, ARF ministers widened the Outlook’s scope with the Simplified Standardized Format, which includes publication of national defense doctrines, defense expenditure, and the total number of personnel in a country’s armed forces.
可贸易行业 — — 最容易受到专属权问题影响的行业 — — 的可盈利性会受到打击，从而投资需求进一步下降。	The profitability of tradable industries – those most likely to suffer from appropriability problems – takes a hit, and investment demand falls further.
他甚至出现在犯罪现场 — — 不是城市暴乱，而是私人的冲动型犯罪，其中没有任何国家方面��原因可以解释共和国总统的到来。	He has even appeared at crime scenes – not urban riots, but private crimes of passion, where no reason of state could possibly warrant the presence of the President of the Republic.
我想，在十八世纪，引用伏尔泰是一回事，但负责任地行动必须以克制不冒犯其他人最珍视的东西为前提，不管这个东西是基督、穆罕默德还是大浩劫（Shoah ） 。	To invoke Voltaire is one thing, I thought at the time, but to act responsibly may presuppose refraining from insulting what is most sacred to others, whether it be Christ, Muhammad, or the Shoah.
在这两起坦桑尼亚案件中，当地法院均裁定妇女与丈夫的共同财产所有权应归小叔所有，其中也包括用她的劳动所得购买的财产。	In both of the Tanzanian cases, local courts ruled that the property the woman had shared with her husband, including items that had been purchased with proceeds from her labor, should go to her brother-in-law.
总而言之，中央银行必须确保货币供给足够大，仅仅出现流动性不足而非资不抵债情形不会迫使银行破产、走向清盘。	Above all, the central bank must ensure that the money supply is large enough that mere illiquidity, rather than insolvency, does not force banks into bankruptcy and liquidation.
平衡这一态势需要更多吸收移民，并让更多女性加入劳动力队伍 — — 实现这两项目标中的哪项都很不容易。	Offsetting this trend will require increased immigration and greater female labor-force participation – neither of which will be easy to bring about.
当人们终于意识到钻石也能为暴力冲突火上浇油时，钻石行业建立起了一套名为“金伯利进程”的审核程序，确保“血钻”无法进入国际贸易环节。	When diamonds’ role in fueling violent conflict in Africa gained worldwide attention, the diamond industry established the Kimberley Process in order to keep “blood diamonds” out of international trade.
暗指“波兰水暖工”偷走当地人工作的指责，无论多么毫无道理而且有辱人格，都引起了深刻的共鸣，尤其是在法国，而法国和荷兰两国最终都投票否决了这个雄心勃勃的宪政项目。	Allusions to “Polish plumbers” coming to steal locals’ jobs, however unjustified and derogatory, resonated deeply, especially in France, and both the French and the Dutch ended up rejecting the ambitious constitutional project.
很长时间以来谷歌无需付出多少努力就能继续坐稳网络搜索领袖的宝座，他们把主要经历都放在“准入”领域，完成其自命的“汇聚全球信息，让它们能为所有人有效服务”的目标。	For a long time Google didn’t need to do much to remain the leader in Internet search, focusing primarily on the “access” part of its self-proclaimed mission “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”
因此在向诗作者奥西普·曼德尔施塔姆（Osip Mandelstam）表示歉意的情况下，我建议与会者读一篇由《克里姆林宫登山家 》 （ 又名《斯大林讽刺诗 》 ， 曼德尔施塔姆正是因为这首嘲讽诗而惨遭放逐而死）改编的讽刺诗。	So, with apologies to Osip Mandelstam, I recommend to conference attendees an adaptation of “The Kremlin Mountaineer” (also known as “The Stalin Epigram”), the mocking poem that cost Mandelstam his life.
伊斯兰教除了解答他们为何生活得不快乐的问题，还能给予他们一种自我价值感和一项可以为之献身的伟大事业。	Islamism, besides offering them an answer to the question why they do not feel happy with the way they live, gives them a sense of their self-worth and a great cause to die for.
事实上，为参与劳动力大军的妇女创造机会是日本政府的改革方案，即所谓的“安倍经济学 ” （ Abenomics）的重要支柱。	Indeed, creating opportunities for women in the workforce is an essential pillar of the government’s reform program, so-called “Abenomics.”
他们就生活在这样的情景中，他们是日益难以预测的气候的受害者；而随着气候变化效应的加剧，他们的数量有可能急剧增加。	They are living it now, as an increasingly unpredictable climate takes its toll; and their numbers are likely to soar as the effects of climate change intensify.
我们必须学会如何人道地捕捞和屠宰野生鱼类 — — 如果这不可能实现的话，去寻找一个没那么残忍和更可持续的方法去食用它们。	We need to learn how to capture and kill wild fish humanely – or, if that is not possible, to find less cruel and more sustainable alternatives to eating them.
但是，在国内，对佐科维治理腐败的能力和决心的信心随着他提名 — — 最近才收回 — — 以不干净手段致富并且拥有极大政治人脉的候选人为印尼警察总长而下滑。	But, domestically, confidence in Jokowi's capacity and will to tackle corruption has eroded with his nomination – only very belatedly withdrawn – of a suspiciously wealthy but politically well-connected candidate for National Police Chief.
但增加家庭占总收入比例的举措将产生极大的破坏效应，因为这会导致一大批国企，出口企业和地方政府破产，而这些又是在政治上很有权势的部门。	But boosting the share of income that goes to the household sector could be hugely disruptive, as it could bankrupt a large number of SOEs, export-oriented firms, and provincial governments, all of which are politically powerful.
此刻的工作萎缩，产量下滑和贸易流动下挫后面还存在着一股压倒性的力量， 它甚至比2008年9月雷曼兄弟银行破产后的金融恐慌更值得重视。	The overwhelming force behind the current collapse of jobs, output, and trade flows, is even more important than the financial panic that followed Lehman Brothers’ default in September 2008.
由前南非总统姆贝基（Thabo Mbeki）为首、非洲财政部长发起的项目正在调查非洲大陆的这一问题。 在非洲，过去三十年中不正当外流资金损失高达1.4万亿美元。	An initiative of African finance ministers, chaired by former South African president Thabo Mbeki, is investigating the issue on the continent, where up to $1.4 trillion was lost to illicit outflows over the last three decades.
巴黎—欧盟和美国开始谈判自由贸易协定 — — 正式名称是跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系（TTIP ） — —标志着欧盟和世界贸易的重要转折。	PARIS – The start of negotiations for a free-trade agreement between the European Union and the United States – officially called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – marks a key turning point for EU and world trade.
第三，拉加德在帮助世界认识技术变迁的全部影响方面 — — 其中一些将造成令人害怕的破坏性影响 — — 起到了重要作用。	Third, Lagarde has done important work in helping the world begin to understand the full implications – some of them frighteningly destabilizing – of technological change.
譬如，像伊拉克这样的一个国家，拥有多种多样的人口：阿拉伯和库尔德人，逊尼派和什叶派，更不要说各种其它宗教少数民族和民族团体。	A country like Iraq, for example, is home to a diverse and varied population: Arab and Kurd, Sunni and Shi’ite, not to mention minorities of other religions and ethnic groups.
但另一方面，区域裂痕表明尽管阿根廷、巴西和墨西哥已加入 20 国集团，但拉美目前的集体谈判力量却在持续削弱。	On the other hand, intra-regional ruptures were an indication of the deterioration of Latin America’s current collective negotiating power, despite the inclusion of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico in the G-20.
全面禁止核试验条约组织筹备委员会正在建立一个监察体系，而该体系已经一再证明即便是小型地下核试验也无法逃过其耳目。	The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is creating a verification regime that has repeatedly proven its reliability in detecting even small underground nuclear tests.
印度储备银行行长拉詹（Raghuram Rajan）呼吁IMF不但要考察非常规货币政策在实施国的效应，也要考察它们对世界其他国家的效应。	Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has called on the IMF to examine the effects of unconventional monetary policy not just on the countries that implement them, but also on the rest of the world.
但市场表现得好像风险很低一样，让VIX和美国国债利率节节下跌，而股票、垃圾债券和新兴市场证券节节走高。	Yet markets acted as if risk was low, driving down the VIX and US Treasury bill rates, and driving up prices of stocks, junk bonds, and emerging-market securities.
首先，揽下现存州债务转换为联邦债务与允许个别成员国发行所有成员国共同兜底的“连带”责任债券是截然不同的。	First, taking over a stock of existing state debt at the federal level is very different from allowing individual member states to issue bonds with “joint and several” liability underwritten by all member states collectively.
结构性改革的缺位意味着各大央行向本国经济体注入的破纪录规模的过剩流动性并没有分配到经济体中最能发挥效用的领域。	The lack of structural reform has meant that the unprecedented excess liquidity that central banks injected into their economies was not allocated to its most efficient uses.
这些选择都在某种程度上反映了实用主义的观点：所有旨在防止意西两国借债状况恶化的金融推进方案都会引发诸多法律，政治和治理难题。	These choices partly reflect pragmatic concerns: all of the financial-engineering schemes that have been proposed to protect Italy and Spain from aggravated borrowing conditions raise legal, political, or governance difficulties.
两年来，我像许多美国人那样，全心专注于证明、揭露以及提醒整个美国有关布什政府的犯罪行为及其违反《美国宪法》和法治的事实 — — 这在国内通常被边缘化了。	For two years, I, like many Americans, have been focused intently on documenting, exposing, and alerting the nation to the Bush administration’s criminality and its assault on the Constitution and the rule of law – a story often marginalized at home.
帕菲特在书中所持有的全套世俗主义观点，以及他在应对矛盾立场时所使用的综合性方法，在过去几十年来首次使那些反对伦理客观性的人陷入了被动。	Parfit’s entirely secular arguments, and the comprehensive way in which he tackles alternative positions, have, for the first time in decades, put those who reject objectivism in ethics on the defensive.
他们因为觉得被边缘化而心怀愤恨，因此会转向社会媒体等公共平台和街头去主张他们的看法、破坏被反对者的权威。	Feeling marginalized and resentful, they may turn to public platforms like social media and the streets to advance their causes and undermine their opponents’ authority.
变化的始作俑者是《名利场》杂志刊登安吉丽娜·朱莉与她蹒跚学步儿子的合影，这个孩子是她从柬埔寨领养的：性感的年轻女人与她的儿子一起待在豪华的酒店卧室，这让单身母亲看上去既有趣又光彩夺目。	Angelina Jolie’s photo spread with her toddler son, adopted from Cambodia, in Vanity Fair heralded this shift: the sexy young woman and her son in a luxurious hotel bedroom made single motherhood look fun and glamorous.
美国国防情报局（Defense Intelligence Agency）认为朝鲜很可能已经开发出了可以用这种导弹携带的小型化核弹头。	The US Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded that North Korea may well have already developed a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could be delivered on such a missile.
他尤其对禁止日本保有“陆、海及空军力量”的宪法规定表示忧虑，认为它似乎与该国的自卫队存在直接相抵触。	He is particularly concerned with the constitutional provision that prohibits Japan from maintaining “land, sea, and air forces,” arguing that it seems to be in direct contradiction with the existence of the country’s Self-Defense Forces.
民主党认为，美国公司不论在哪里开展经营活动，都得益于美国的法治和确保它们不受不公对待的实力（通常通过条约保证 ） ， 因此它们应该为这些和其他优势买单。	Democrats believe that, because US corporations, wherever they operate, benefit from America’s rule of law and power to ensure that they are not mistreated (often guaranteed by treaty), they ought to pay for these and other advantages.
尽管中国的人均收入在短时间内上涨了很多，但现在仍和阿尔巴尼亚相当 — — 即位列199个国家的中游。	Though it has come very far in a short time, its per capita income is now about the same as Albania’s – that is, in the middle of the distribution of 199 countries.
去年秋天苹果地图的拙劣表现把许多人引向了错误的方向，造成了严重的公众不满和一次管理层地震，这是否意味着苹果的最好时代已经过去了？	Could the rollout last fall of the inferior Apple Maps, which sent people to the wrong destination – causing severe public embarrassment and leading to a managerial shakeup – foreshadow a time when Apple’s best days are behind it?
今年，G20将在德国的领导下关注构建恢复力、改善可持续性、承担气候变化责任 — — 数字化是这些领域解决方案必不可少的一部分。	This year, the G20, under Germany’s leadership, will focus on building resilience, improving sustainability, and assuming responsibility for climate change – all areas where digitization must be part of the solution.
但关于液压致裂法���最关键（通常也总是被忽略）的一个要点是页岩气和其他碳氢化合物一样，都是不可再生的。	But the most crucial – and almost always overlooked – point about fracking is that shale gas, like all hydrocarbons, can be used only once.
但彻底解决腐败、污染、产能过剩和债务还需要靠大手笔供给侧结构性改革，特别是与完善产权及契约制度相关的改革。	But it has not been enough to root out corruption fully, and problems with pollution, overcapacity, and debt remain, which can be addressed only through a major supply-side structural-reform program.
在法国，我创建的智库机构“自由世代 ” （ GenerationLibre）发布了一份长达150页的个人数据所有权报告并引发了激烈的公众辩论。	In France, the think tank I created, GenerationLibre, issued a 150-page report on personal data ownership, which prompted a fierce public debate.
制定国内制度和在对社会包容而言十分重要的广大其他领域的适当的激励将是改善生活水平、同时增强增长过程本身的关键。	Developing domestic institutions and appropriate incentives in a broad range of other areas that are relevant for social inclusion will be vital to improving living standards, while reinforcing the growth process itself.
2014年商品价格崩溃导致拉美风险价差扩大，但只提高了1.5个百分点，约为雷曼兄弟时期震荡率的1/3。	The commodity-price collapse in 2014 caused Latin American risk spreads to grow, but only by 1.5 percentage points, which was about one-third the impact of the Lehman Brothers shock.
这就造成了一种可能性，即美国的投票权可能暂时下降到15%以下，也就是无法达到否决需要IMF成员国85%支持率的决定的阈值。	This opens the possibility that the US’s voting power could temporarily fall below the 15% threshold needed to veto decisions that require the support of 85% of IMF members’ votes.
由于美国贸易缺口的最大一部分来自中国这个被诽谤为货币操纵作弊者的国家，双边贸易逆差因而成为了诋毁中国者的指路明灯。	Because the biggest share of the US trade gap is with China, a country vilified as a currency-manipulating cheater, the bilateral trade deficit has become the lightening rod for China bashers.
前两次工业革命的基础是伟大发明家灵光一现制造的机器，它们被狡猾的企业家买下，并要求获得“他们的”机器所产生的收入流的产权。	The first two industrial revolutions were built on machines produced by great inventors in glorified barns and bought by cunning entrepreneurs who demanded property rights over the income stream “their” machines generated.
和民主党初选中的伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）一样，他一开始通过与本党主流要人决裂吸引大众。	Like Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, he started drawing large crowds by breaking ranks with his party’s mainstream.
如果欧洲的领导人希望鼓励自己的人民去建立一个共同的未来，他们必须首先展现出对这一未��面目的理解 — — 以及如何最大程度地实现它 。	If Europe’s leaders are to inspire their people to build a shared future, they must demonstrate an understanding of what that future has in store – and how to make the most of it.
但是，如今叙利亚陷入了野蛮内战并已经造成130,000多人死亡，利比亚正处于崩溃边缘，埃及权力也回归军方并取缔了穆斯林兄弟会，突尼斯成了唯一的成功例子。	But, with Syria immersed in a brutal civil war that has claimed more than 130,000 lives already, Libya on the verge of collapse, and Egypt returning power to the army and proscribing the Muslim Brotherhood, Tunisia has been the only success.
其次，越来越长的圣诞节前消费旺季倾向于扩张信用，从而导致玩具和电子产品市场的秋季泡沫，泡沫将在1月破灭，给接下来的11个月带来潜在破坏后果。	Second, the ever-lengthening pre-Christmas consumption boom tends to expand credit, thus causing bubbles in the toy and electronics market during the fall that will burst in January, with potentially damaging consequences for the rest of the year.
一些人指出，美国可以通过向朝鲜妥协增强其在东北亚的安全 — — 具体而言，就是能诺不袭击或颠覆金氏政权。	Some people argue that the US could enhance security in northeast Asia by compromising with the North Koreans – specifically, by promising not to attack or attempt to topple the Kim regime.
1999年，他们强制大规模迁移，随后北约进行了干预，结果结束了塞尔维亚的统治并且建立了联合国管理下的准国家。 结果，唯有独立方能够让他们容忍。	Their forced mass exodus in 1999 and NATO’s subsequent intervention, which ended Serbia’s rule and established a quasi-state under UN administration, has made anything other than independence intolerable.
与此同时，天然气占据了能源消费的51 % ， 石油占32 % ， 煤、可再生及水电核电占17 % 。	At the same time, natural gas accounts for 51% of energy consumption, compared to 32% for oil and barely 17% for coal, renewables, and hydroelectric and nuclear power.
当人们的欢腾喜悦之情褪去，巴勒斯坦应得的赞扬之辞逐渐远去，阿拉伯统治者和阿拉伯大众（大多被媒体称为“阿拉伯街道 ” ） 也许将开始问一些尖锐问题。	"When the jubilation and the justly earned compliments for the Palestinians subside, both Arab rulers and Arab masses (the much hyped ""Arab street"") may start asking some hard questions."
伦敦—自70年前中国共产党领袖毛泽东与他的国民党对手蒋介石会面以来，台湾海峡便成为一道不可逾越的海峡。	LONDON – A great deal of water has flowed through the Taiwan Strait in the 70 years since the leader of China’s Communists, Mao Zedong, met the leader of his nationalist opponents, Chiang Kai-shek.
如今，在美国抛弃自由贸易之际，中国能够站出来推动自由贸易，从而改善其作为主要力量的形象，证明其对全球治理和发展的承诺。	Now, with the US abandoning free trade, China can take up the mantle of promoting it, thereby improving its image as a major power and demonstrating its commitment to global governance and development.
事实上，乌克兰要想实现和平 — — 防止普京把同样的招数用到其他区域 — — 世界各国就必须让他明白有些界限永远不能越过。	Indeed, if peace is to come to Ukraine – and if Putin is to be prevented from using the same strategy elsewhere – the world must let him know that some lines may never be crossed.
所有195个签署国都提交了各自的国家自主贡献目标（Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ） 。	All 195 signatories have offered their own Intended Nationally Determined Contributions.
一些批评家认为，即使实施了这些措施，东盟也难以成为平稳运行的单一实体，因为成员国经济发展水平差异太大。	Some critics insist that, even with such efforts, ASEAN members vary too widely in terms of their level of economic development to create a smoothly functioning single entity.
唯一允许参选的候选人都具有无懈可击的宗教信仰，效忠一个体制 — — 虽然在这个体制里最重要的决定是由非选举产生的神职人员来做出的。	The only candidates allowed to run were men with impeccable religious credentials, loyal to a regime whose most important decisions are made by unelected clerics.
食品行业正是这么做的，为了改善口感、延长保质期，西方饮食越来越多的将两者同时纳入，从而恶化了胰岛素抵抗和慢性新陈代谢病。	The food industry does precisely that, mixing more of both into the Western diet for palatability and shelf life, thereby intensifying insulin resistance and chronic metabolic disease.
就算这是他的功劳，强势美元也并不一定有利于他的政策目标；而汇率甚至都算不上是衡量货币真实实力的准确指标。	But even if he could, a strong greenback is not necessarily good for his policy objectives; nor is the exchange rate even an accurate measure of the currency’s true strength.
这不仅将向伊朗统治者表明美国对协议的态度非常严肃，而且要让他们明白，美国所提出的将是他们可以期望得到的最好的交易。	That should signal to Iran’s rulers not only that the US is serious about a deal, but also that whatever the US offers is likely to be the best deal that they can get.
欧洲央行与欧元区国家关系紧张，无论针对外部的其他货币，或是内部的通货膨胀，都不利于维持共同货币稳定。	Tensions at the ECB and between the euro-zone countries do not bode well for the stability of the common currency, both externally, vis-à-vis other currencies, and internally, in terms of inflation.
包括我在内的一些经济学家现在主张将获取完全福利的年龄再提高三年到70岁，然后按照生活指数去调整未来合资格领取全部福利的年龄以保持受益人的预期寿命不变。	Some economists, including me, now advocate raising the age for full benefits by another three years, to 70, and then indexing the future age for full benefits to keep the life expectancy of beneficiaries unchanged.
中西部和西南部各州经历了很可能因为长期变暖而导致的长期干旱，农业大州的经济非常依赖于大型的地下水库，但水库的水量却因为过度抽取正在日益枯竭。	Midwestern and southwestern states have been in a prolonged drought that might well be the result of long-term warming, and the farm states rely heavily on water from a huge underground reservoir that is being depleted by over-pumping.
但欧洲人民党投票的主要原因是其希望保住作为规模最大的欧盟政党的机会，同时确保韦博成为下一任欧盟委员会领导者。	But the EPP’s vote was largely motivated by its desire to preserve its chances of remaining the largest EU party and ensuring that Weber becomes the next European Commission leader.
由于私人债务可以转变为公共债务，因此事实上，政府债务的低负担也许并不能如这些国家所愿地为它们提供缓冲。	Since private debts have a way of turning into public liabilities, a low government-debt burden might not, in fact, provide these countries with the cushion that they think they have.
这些问题的答案不仅对于这些国家本身十分重要，对于它们的邻国也很重要，因为邻国可能因此出现免疫退步的情况。	The answers to these questions are important not only for the countries themselves, but also for their neighbors, which could be put at risk by backsliding on immunization.
果真如此的话，蕞尔小国哥斯达黎加将成为未来的希望灯塔，证明有可能存在另一个世界，在这里，启蒙价值观 — — 道理、理性对话、科学和自由 — — 将会兴盛发达，让所有人都受益。	If it does, Costa Rica, despite its small size, will be a beacon of hope for the future, showing that another world is possible, one where Enlightenment values – reason, rational discourse, science, and freedom – flourish, to the benefit of all.
葬礼最后演化成了暴乱，数千名送行者在葬礼结束离开途中被袭。 警方向人群发射了催泪弹，严阵以待教堂外人群投掷汽油瓶、石块袭击教堂内人员。	Police fired tear gas into the compound, standing by as those outside the cathedral launched petrol bombs, hurled rocks, and shot at those inside.
在下周的UNFCCC会议上，一些政府将援引FCTC作为重要的先例支持化石燃料行业应该被排除在进行中的气候谈判之外，因为它与可靠气候政策之间存在利益冲突。	At the UNFCCC conference next week, some governments will hold up the FCTC as a strong precedent to argue that the fossil-fuel industry must be excluded from ongoing climate negotiations, owing to its conflicts of interest with sound climate policy.
首先，为回应2001年袭击制定的“先发制人”的总体策略被不恰当地扩大到涵盖伊拉克和其它威胁要发展大规模杀伤性武器的其它所谓“流氓”国家。	First, the doctrine of “preemption,” which was devised in response to the 2001 attacks, was inappropriately broadened to include Iraq and other so-called “rogue states” that threatened to develop weapons of mass destruction.
经合组织将PISA立为全球评估，因为在当今全球化的世界中，学生必须能够与来自多种背景的人合作，接受不同的思想、观点和价值。	The OECD established PISA as a global assessment, because in today’s globalized world students must be able to collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds and appreciate different ideas, perspectives, and values.
另外，许多沙龙的支持者在这项计划所包含的成本和利益之间进退两难。 他们有的弃权，有的甚至投票反对，但仍然都希望沙龙担任他们的领导。	In addition, many Sharon supporters, torn by what they saw as the plan's combination of costs and benefits, stayed home or even voted against it, but still want Sharon as their leader.
同一年，另一名律师、人权领袖斯坦尼斯拉夫·马尔科洛夫（Stanislav Markelov）在一次新闻发布会后遭射杀。	The same year, another lawyer, Stanislav Markelov, a champion of human rights, was shot following a news conference.
虽然对于其它种族仇恨而言也同样如此，但是二战犹太人大屠杀使得反犹主义显得独一无二，因为它与那场几乎灭种的大屠杀串通一气。	This is true also for other kinds of group hatred, but the Holocaust makes anti-Semitism unique, because it is an emotion complicit in the near annihilation of an entire people.
人们开始以自己的方式寻求解决问题的办法。 其具体表现形式是参加集会、签名请愿和向政治党派和活动集团捐助的市民达到了前所未有的人数。	People began taking matters into their own hands by attending rallies, signing petitions, and donating to political parties and activist groups in unprecedented numbers.
最后的担忧是，尽管尚未完成整个周期，全球情绪已经从担忧政治风险转变为忘记，尽管许多政治风险仍然相当巨大。	One final concern is that, while not having gone full circle, the global mood has shifted from fear about political risks to obliviousness, even though many such risks still loom large.
但要使其有效，政策制定者应该把重点放在三个关键领域：预防措施；对无家可归者的快速和直接支持；并为那些向更稳定住房过渡的人提供援助。	But for it to be effective, policymakers should focus on three key areas: prevention; immediate and direct support for the homeless; and assistance for those making the transition to more stable housing.
最根本的观点分歧可能是在各党派对控制未来的理解上 — — 在后萨达姆时代创建更美好的生活以及更安全的社会的可能性。	The most radical differences in opinion can be found in communal perceptions of control of the future – the possibility of building a better life in post-Saddam Iraq – and security.
布拉格之春是共产党内部危机造成的，但是说它仅仅是共产党党内斗争的结果却是在篡改历史，并且是在否定民族遗产中的重要一部分。	The Prague Spring was provoked by a crisis in the Communist Party, but the claim that it was merely a result of political squabbles among Party members falsifies history and rejects a significant fragment of the national heritage.
2007年9月份，在世界金融危机从出现预警信号到变成完全的金融危机的前一年��斯特劳斯-卡恩自己暗示国际货币基金组织处于“身份危机”之中。	In September 2007, a year before warning signs gave way to a full-blown financial meltdown, Strauss-Kahn himself suggested that the IMF was in a “crisis of identity.”
丹麦的政策对于全球的总体贡献(根据有关标准进行衡量，例如，增加的农业生产以及湿地保护等等) 将会是大约110亿欧元。	The total advantage to the world (measured according to all relevant criteria, such as lives saved, agricultural production increased, wetlands preserved, etc.) from Denmark’s policy would be about €11 million.
专家们认为如果共和党人反对这一改革的话，他们就将在下一代选民中丢失拉丁裔选票，并使之降格成为一个几乎永远在野的状态。	Pundits argued that if the Republicans resisted reform, they would lose the Latino vote for the next generation, relegating their party to near-permanent opposition status.
事实上，在关于欧元区通缩风险的喧闹的争论中，欧洲央行在国际货币基金组织、经合组织、金融市场分析师和盎格鲁-撒克逊经济学家的攻势下相当被动。	Indeed, the ECB already has been driven onto the defensive by the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, financial-market analysts, and Anglo-Saxon economists in the wake of feverish discussion of the risk of deflation in the eurozone.
在1960年到1991年间美国的经济复苏速度都相当快，那时从衰退的最低点恢复到衰退前产出水平平均只要不到2个季度，而就业在八个月以内就恢复到原来水平了。	From 1960 until 1991, US recoveries were typically rapid. From the trough of recessions, recovery to pre-recession output levels took less than two quarters on average, and employment recovered within eight months.
面对美国众议院威胁要通过一项谴责土耳其人在90年前对亚美尼亚族人实施种族灭绝的决议，两国在伊拉克问题上产生分歧真是显得特别不合时宜。	With the threat that the US House of Representatives will approve a resolution that accuses Turks of genocide against ethic Armenians nine decades ago, this is a particularly inopportune moment for the two countries to be at odds over Iraq.
真正的问题在于市场竞争没能带来替代的提供者以及降低对我们目前的富商一代为他们的工作所要求获得的财富的出价。	The problem is a broader failure of market competition to give rise to alternative providers and underbid the fortunes demanded for their work by our current generation of mercantile princes.
我们必须拆分这些庞大而不能倒闭的银行。 没有任何证据可以说明这些“金融怪兽”在接受救援后，会给社会大众带来任何好处。	We need to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; there is no evidence that these behemoths deliver societal benefits that are commensurate with the costs they have imposed on others.
下一个经济合作协议是跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） ， 该协议包括了世界最大贸易区内的12个国家。	Next in line is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would unite 12 countries in the world’s largest trading area.
该机构坚持不懈，还发现了伊朗的核子项目，尽管这是伊朗的异议团体揭发伊朗政权的某些秘密设施之后才发现的。	The IAEA’s tenacity also has smoked out much of Iran’s nuclear program, albeit only after an Iranian dissident group disclosed the existence of some of the regime’s secret facilities.
除削减其潜在的监狱刑期外（削减的具体年限尚不清楚 ） ， 马纳福特还要求制定一项能保障他家人安全的计划。	Aside from having his potential prison sentence reduced (to an unknown amount), Manafort also wanted an arrangement that would keep his family safe.
相反，他们有可能重点关注美国政治极化和简单的意识形态 — — 一些理应更加了解情况的人也是如此 — — 如何让美国陷入了一场毫无必要的有百害而无一利的冲突。	Instead, they are likely to focus on how America’s political polarization and simplistic ideology – shared by many who should know better – drove it into a highly damaging and utterly pointless conflict.
为唯一的恢复之道 — — 因此也是唯一提高勘探和产量的办法 — — 是修订立法和监管以确保行业利益得到更好的保护。	And the only way to restore it – and thereby increase exploration and production – will be to overhaul legislation and regulation to ensure stronger protection of industry interests.
华盛顿—过去三年，几十个国家每年7月都要开会展示它们为实现可持续发展目标（SDG）而制定的国家计划。	WASHINGTON, DC – For the last three years, dozens of countries have gathered each July to present their national plans to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
自大、无知和对商业利益的屈服在1990年引起了最大后果，当时，英国农业大臣约翰·古墨（John Gummer）用电视直播其女吃汉堡的镜头，宣布英国牛肉是安全的。	This mixture of hubris, ignorance, and subservience to commercial interests reached peak toxicity in 1990, when the UK’s agriculture minister, John Gummer, televised his daughter eating a hamburger, declaring that British beef was safe.
就像美国媒体反映美国人民的愿望，并在战争时期充当美国军队的啦啦队长一样，半岛电视台的阿拉伯情结也谈不上什么罪过。	But this is no more a crime than the fact that America's media reflects American aspirations, and in times of war behaves like a cheerleader for US forces.
对冲基金，共同基金，资产管理公司，养老基金和主权财富基金在全球各地运作，涵盖了各个合法司法管辖区以及著名作家毛姆（W. Somerset Maugham）所谓“那些见不得光的人公开活动的地方 ” 。	Hedge funds, mutual funds, asset-management companies, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds operate from all across the globe, in legitimate jurisdictions and in what W. Somerset Maugham once described as “sunny places for shady people.”
卡塔米(1997-2005)试图实行大刀阔斧的政治改革，而拉夫桑贾尼(1989-97)则企图让伊朗经济向西方开放。	Muhammad Khatami (1997-2005) tried to implement dramatic political reform, while Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-97) tried to open the Iranian economy to the West.
一旦出现这种情况，欧洲央行可能不得不通过自身所谓的“直接货币交易”计划来大规模购入欧元区各国政府债券 — — 而该计划正是许多德国政策制定者和经济学家坚决反对的。	If that happens, the ECB may well be compelled to initiate large-scale purchases of eurozone government bonds through its so-called “outright monetary transactions” scheme – a plan that many German policymakers and economists staunchly oppose.
如今，安德烈·卢戈沃伊（Andrei Lugovoi，克格勃特工，英国政府怀疑是他用钋投毒杀了利特维年科）在俄罗斯杜马供职。	Today, Andrei Lugovoi, the KGB agent that the British government suspects of delivering the polonium that killed Litvinenko, sits in the Russian Duma.
在如斯洛伐克和波兰等一些国家，极右的民族主义党派提供了另一种选择。 它们通过提供传统价值观和熟悉的敌人来慰籍民心，取得支持。	In some countries, like Slovakia and Poland, far-right nationalist parties provide another alternative, by offering the soothing appeal of traditional values and familiar enemies.
远隔重洋的军事灾难不断消耗着这个国家的财政资源，美国人为此付出的代价有可能达到数万亿美元之巨，这一触目惊心的数据来自于琳达·比尔梅斯和约瑟夫•斯蒂格利茨不久前所进行的研究。	Far-flung military misadventures continue to stretch the country’s fiscal resources, with costs potentially running into many trillions of dollars, according a recent study by Linda Bilmes and Joseph Stiglitz.
但尽管Facebook缺乏透明度 — — 且无视客户的担忧 — — 肯定令人不安，但所有这些投诉都有些不得要领。	But, though Facebook’s lack of transparency is certainly disconcerting – as is its deafness to its users’ concerns – these complaints miss the point.
纽约-现在存在着这样一种共识，已经持续了一年的美国经济衰退可能会漫长而且深入，而且几乎所有国家都将受到影响。	NEW YORK – A consensus now exists that America’s recession – already a year old – is likely to be long and deep, and that almost all countries will be affected.
比较而言，它们向叙利亚、阿富汗、索马里、南苏丹和苏丹 — — 这些寻求庇护者最主要的来源国 — — 投入的ODA为32亿美元。	By comparison, they spent $3.2 billion of ODA in Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan – the top five countries from which those asylum-seekers had fled.
真正有帮助的是让欧元坚挺起来 — — 即让投资者确信，这一共同货币拥有光明的未来，因为它有强大的货币、财政、金融和政治联盟做后盾。	What would help is to turn the euro around – in the sense of convincing investors that the common currency has a bright future, because it is underpinned by a stronger monetary, fiscal, financial, and political union.
第一项协定是11月底以比尔·盖茨、马克·扎克伯格和杰夫·贝佐斯为首的一群亿万富翁宣布成立一个200亿美元的基金支持清洁能源研究。	The first happened at the end of November, when a group of billionaires led by Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos announced the creation of a $20 billion fund to back clean-energy research.
温斯顿·丘吉尔（Winston Churchill）曾后悔自己在任财政大臣时让英国在1925恢复了金本位，那堪称一场灾难。	Winston Churchill famously regretted overseeing the United Kingdom’s catastrophic return to the gold standard in 1925, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer.
但梅德韦杰夫这个当今的政府首脑，则更像是一个年轻的合伙人而不仅仅只是一个推销员，而且将继续增加自己的才干和影响力，以便有朝一日接管整间商店。	But Medvedev, today’s front-office guy, is more of a junior partner than a simple salesperson. He may yet grow in stature and influence, and eventually inherit the store.
虽然难以预测奥巴马在这条路上会走多远，但在这样的情况下会晤北朝鲜的领导人在政治上将是困难的。 这一点奥巴马在上任之初就会明白。	While it is difficult to predict how far he might move in this direction, it would be politically difficult for Obama to meet the North Korean leader in such a manner, something that he is likely to learn early in his presidency.
印度的政治领袖平均年龄与公民平均年龄之差为世界之最，而莫迪将是印度第一位出生于1947年独立后的总理。	In a country where the gap between the average age of political leaders and citizens is one of the world’s widest, Modi will be the first prime minister born after India gained independence in 1947.
2016年也好不到哪里去，经合组织产出增长预计为2.5 % ， 而其他地区GDP增长率预计为3.8 % — —接近危机前平均水平。	And 2016 is shaping up to be no better, with output in the OECD growing by 2.5%, while the rest of the world’s GDP expands at a 3.8% rate – close to the pre-crisis average.
对世界上许多“无银行服务”的人（即无法累积存款或建立信用记录的人）来说，唯一的选择是为高贷款-房价比按揭支付极高的风险溢价。	For the world’s many “unbanked,” who cannot accumulate savings or establish a credit record, the only option is to pay steep risk premiums for high loan-to-value mortgages.
但是如果新兴市场迫使欧洲承接所有的调整，结果将是灾难性的，欧元对美元的比价将达到1.5、1.6甚至更到，这对贸易将造成绝对可怕的后果。	But if emerging markets force Europe to take all the adjustment, the results would be catastrophic, pushing up the euro to $1.50, $1.60 or beyond, with truly dire consequences for trade.
如果德国联邦议院代表德国选民点了头，那么就不会有阻碍EFA成立的条约或宪法性条款；否则的话，当初ESM也就不会成立了。	There can be no treaty or constitutional clause preventing the establishment of the EFA if the German electorate, as represented by the Bundestag, approves it; otherwise, the ESM could not have been created.
但是，在一家公司存在一个控股股东的情况下，控制权之争就不太可能发生，因此，在股权受控的公司里这样的控制权争夺安排就无关紧要了。	When a company has a controlling shareholder, however, control contests are not possible, and the arrangements governing such contests are thus irrelevant.
这可以解释被弓形虫感染的老鼠为什么多巴胺水平居高不下，也可以解释多巴胺抑制剂为什么可以抑制他们因寄生虫感染所导致的行为。	This would explain why rats infected with T. gondii have higher levels of dopamine, and why dopamine inhibitors can suppress their parasite-induced behavior.
但我们只消回顾一下2010年匈牙利和2015年波兰的关键选举：我的同事Kim Lane Scheppele指出，当时的选民们严格履行了民主理论两党制度下对他们的要求。	But recall the crucial elections in Hungary in 2010 and Poland in 2015: as my colleague Kim Lane Scheppele has pointed out, voters then did exactly what democratic theory told them they should do in a two-party system.
发自剑桥 — — 随着一年的增长迟缓继续蔓延到下一年，人们对未来几十年的未来走向也出现了越来越多的争议。	CAMBRIDGE – As one year of sluggish growth spills into the next, there is growing debate about what to expect over the coming decades.
而日本的最新经验表明，对抗最强大的威胁 — — 9.0级地震及随后三米高的海啸 — — 要求大规模、高投入的建设项目。	And, as Japan’s recent experience demonstrated, protecting against the most powerful threats – such as the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake and the subsequent three-meter tsunami – would require massive, costly construction projects.
这样一来，市场经济鼓励专业化：我们熟练掌握狭窄范围内的某种技能或产品，并以此来换取数以百万计我们不知道怎么制作的其他物品。	As a result, a market economy encourages specialization: We become very good in a narrow set of skills or products, and exchange them for millions of other things we have no clue how to do or make.
谈到成为1979年革命宣言的Jalal Al-e Ahmad1962年的著作Gharbzadegi （ 《 西方中毒 》 ） 时，德黑兰的一位世俗学者对我说��“现在已经没人再读Al-e Ahmad的书了。	Referring to Jalal Al-e Ahmad’s 1962 book Gharbzadegi (“West-toxication”), which became one of the manifestos of the 1979 revolution, one secular intellectual in Teheran remarked to me that, “Nobody reads Al-e Ahmad anymore.
作为美国联邦储备委员会主席，在最近一段时间里，他比其他任何央行行长更加积极地试图使用货币政策刺激经济。	As Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board, he has gone further than any other central banker in recent times in attempting to stimulate the economy through monetary policy.
房价上升引起建筑活动激增，建筑活动激增创造年轻的低技能工人的就业机会（这些人的就业选择十分有限 ） ， 并为房地产开发商和承建商带来巨额利润。	Rising prices trigger a surge in building activity, which creates job opportunities for young, low-skill workers, whose employment options are otherwise limited, and generates large profits for property developers and builders.
当然，极权体制已经对危险有所警觉 — — 我们应该预见到他们会用各种严苛的做法剥夺持有加密货币的权利。	Of course, authoritarian regimes are already waking up to the dangers – and we should expect them to proscribe holding cryptocurrencies in various draconian ways.
但大部分英国年轻人实际上并没有行使投票权，这使得英国年长者 — — 他们大多支持退欧 — — 赢得了胜利。	But most young British did not actually show up to cast their votes, allowing the UK’s older, predominantly pro-Brexit cohorts to win the day.
伦敦—十年前的这个月，法国巴黎银行（BNP Paribas）决定限制投资者提取他们在三只基金中的存款。	LONDON – Ten years ago this month, the French bank BNP Paribas decided to limit investors’ access to the money they had deposited in three funds.
1968年5月，法国的学生们¾¾至少是其中的一部分人¾¾他们走上街头打算创建一个新世界。 他们梦想着毛泽东时代的中国，那个处在残酷且失去理智的文化大革命中的中国。	In May 1968, in France, the students – or some of them, at least – who took to the streets to invent a new world were dreaming of Maoist China, a China in the midst of the brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution.
就在最近G20多伦多峰会举行的前夕，中国宣布了一项让人民币略微升值的方案，但是一些美国国会议员仍然心存质疑，并且威胁对中国商品增加关税。	Just before the recent G-20 meeting in Toronto, China announced a formula that would allow modest renminbi appreciation, but some American Congressmen remain unconvinced, and threaten to increase tariffs on Chinese goods.
美国对外政策上的昏招令伊朗成为整个区域的地缘政治核心力量，成为连结起该区域东西地带不稳定因素的桥梁。	As a result of America’s foreign-policy folly, Iran became the central geo-political player in the entire region, linking the western and eastern part of this long belt of instability.
显然，以下国家不会或无法承担领导者角色：英国自绝于欧洲；法国在明年总统选举前都将陷入瘫痪，总统选举后也未必能恢复；而西班牙甚至连政府都组织不起来。	The obvious candidates will not or cannot take on the role: Britain has excluded itself; France is paralyzed until next year’s presidential election and possibly beyond; and Spain cannot even form a government.
朱利安尼断言说，特朗普完全可以在椭圆形办公室内枪杀了前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey）但无须被起诉。	Giuliani asserted that Trump could have shot and killed former FBI director James Comey in the Oval Office and not be indicted for it.
同时，随着欧洲委员会在政策目标和上限方面表现出更多的灵活性，欧元区其他地区也能更有效地利用财政政策。	And, with the European Commission showing more flexibility on targets and ceilings, the rest of the eurozone may also be able to use fiscal policy more effectively.
但欧洲央行为自己的年会选择了一个类似的“非货币”话题 （ “ 发达国家的投资与增长 ” ） 就很能说明问题了。	But it is telling that the European Central Bank chose, for its own annual gathering, a similar “non-monetary” topic (“Investment and Growth in Advanced Countries”).
在最近的峰会上，欧盟领导人强调，将在2013年1月1日前完成单一监督机制的设计，并于2013年底之前开始实施。	At their most recent summit, European Union leaders reiterated their commitment to finalize the design of a single supervisory mechanism by January 1, 2013, and to activate it by the end of next year.
风险尤其大的是那些几乎完全用美元借贷但美元收入有限的新兴国家公司，它们的资产和负债或者收入和支出之间存在严重的货币错配。	At particular risk are emerging-country companies that, having borrowed overwhelmingly in dollars but generating only limited dollar earnings, might have large currency mismatches in their assets and liabilities or their incomes and expenditures.
尽管有无数的倡议要审视它的战争罪行，尤其是它对中国的占领，但是迄今为止官方并没有作出这样的举动，而德国人则对他们的战争罪行承担了集体责任。	Although there have been numerous initiatives to investigate its war guilt, especially its occupation of China, there has not yet been an official effort comparable to what the Germans undertook to take collective responsibility for their war crimes.
比如，在感恩节后的星期五，特朗普自己的政府发布了一份主要报告，警告不受遏制的气候变化将给美国造成巨大的经济和人力成本。	On the Friday after Thanksgiving, for example, Trump’s own government published a major report warning that unchecked climate change will impose massive economic and human costs on the United States.
在如此展示武力之后，美国国防部长马蒂斯（Jim Mattis）不诚实地声称“显然，我们并不是要介入叙利亚内战 。 ”	Following this show of force, US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis disingenuously stated that, “Obviously, we are not getting engaged in the Syrian civil war.”
民主党方面，希拉里·克林顿的竞选文宣和党的政纲提出了一项具体计划捍卫多德-弗兰克立法，并在敦促大企业减少复杂性并（如有必要）减小规模方面更进了一步。	On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton’s campaign materials and the party platform point to a detailed plan to defend Dodd-Frank and to go further in terms of pressing the largest firms to become less complex and, if necessary, smaller.
上合组织不仅为中国提供对抗亚太地区现存的美国领导的联盟的平台，而且正日益被用来防止形成美国领导的限制中国推进的网络。	The SCO provides China not only with a platform to confront the existing US-led alliance in the Asia-Pacific region, but is increasingly being used to prevent the formation of a US-led network to restrain China’s advance.
特朗普的前任奥巴马在2014年俄罗斯吞并克里米亚后（此举一开始令普京支持率大增）对俄罗斯实施了制裁，制裁所造成的经济不安全让俄罗斯人怨声载道。	Russians resent the mounting economic insecurity brought about by the sanctions Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, initiated after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 (a move that initially bolstered Putin’s flagging approval ratings).
发自摩尔多瓦首府基希讷乌 — — 当年在前苏联势力范围内被视为灵丹妙药的“颜色革命”如今似乎已经落伍了。	CHISINAU – Today, “color revolutions,” which a few years ago were seen as promising developments in the post-Soviet space, seem to be out of fashion.
印度驻美国大使拉奥（Nirupama Rao）称这些防务交易为美印关系“新前沿 ” ， 且“前途十分光明 ” 。	Nirupama Rao, India’s ambassador to the US, has called such defense transactions “the new frontier” in US-India relations and “a very promising one at that.”
被这样逼到了墙角之后，许多巴勒斯坦人已经开始看不到除了极端策略之外，他们还能有任何其他选择来实现自己的国家梦想。	Pushed to the wall in this way, many Palestinians are beginning to see no other option for fulfilling their national aspirations than radical tactics.
当前政策制定者所面对的堪称一个极端左右为难的困局，这意味着在重大经济危机的背景下他们应该更灵活地使用通胀目标原则。	The current high-stakes conundrum faced by policymakers suggests that they should apply inflation-targeting principles more flexibly in the context of a major economic shock.
比如，欧盟长期以来一直秉承“预防原则 ” ， 阻止可能危害人类健康的产品进入欧盟市场，即使科学证据尚不足以彻底否定这一产品。	For example, the EU has long been committed to the “precautionary principle,” which prevents products that may harm human health from entering the EU market – even if the scientific evidence is not yet conclusive.
这种仇恨并没有随着纳粹主义的消亡而寿终正寝，在解放奥斯维辛65年后，我们还可以亲身感受到这种可怕的仇恨情绪。	It is a hatred that did not disappear with Nazism, and that one can still, 65 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, glimpse in terrifying manifestations.
沙龙和您可能感觉到，在加沙地带需要单方面的行动。 但是，如果双方都采取行动，从加沙撤军对双方所产生的利益要大很多。	Sharon and you might have felt that unilateral action was needed in Gaza, but the withdrawal from Gaza could have produced many more benefits for both sides had it been done bilaterally.
再加上异乎寻常的低波动性 — — 在美国，标普500指数在2017年（至当日为止）呈现了历史上的最低单日损失 — — 让投资者几乎可以在夜里睡个好觉了。	Add to that unusually low volatility – in the US, 2017 so far has shown the lowest daily loss in the entire history of the S&P 500 index – and there has been little to keep investors up at night.
拉皮德（Yair Lapid）的新中间派党未来党（Yesh Atid）取得了令人瞩目的成功，这让内塔尼亚胡与其传统极端主义盟友组成右翼联盟的希望渺茫。	The remarkable success of Yair Lapid’s new centrist party, Yesh Atid (“there is a future”), makes it practically impossible for Netanyahu to form a right-wing coalition with his traditional allies from the lunatic fringe.
问题油然而生：为何人们不把钱从TIPS（还有美国国库债券和其他安全性资产）中转投给股市（以及其他相对有风险的资产 ） ？	It naturally raises the question: why aren’t people moving their money from TIPS (and US Treasury bonds and other safe assets) to stocks (and other relatively risky assets)?
其中最大的资金流出渠道是银行渠道，在2015年一年内各大国际银行就将其在发展中国家的信贷总量削减了超过8000亿美元。	The largest outflows have been through banking channels, with international banks reducing their gross credit exposures to developing countries by more than $800 billion in 2015.
当然，官方新闻语言在很多地方仍然大行其道，在官方的声明和行动中也肯定有奥维尔的作品中所描述的那些事情的痕迹。	Of course, Newspeak is alive and well in many places, and there are certainly Orwellian echoes in the authorities’ pronouncements and actions.
比如，美国各大院校提供大相径庭的核心课程（如大一微积分、经济学和美国历史等 ） ， 并且动辄开设500人以上的大课，意义何在？	For example, what sense does it make for each college in the United States to offer its own highly idiosyncratic lectures on core topics like freshman calculus, economics, and US history, often with classes of 500 students or more?
作为支持南北和达尔富尔和平进程的交换条件，美国将推行一个明确，连贯而有约束力的方案以实现两国关系正常化。	In exchange for action on the North-South and Darfur peace efforts, the US would implement a clear, sequenced, and binding path to normalization of relations.
在经历了9月选举惨败后，SPD起先决定成为反对党，这是个真心实意的决定，甚至可以说在策略上相当合理。	The SPD’s initial decision to go into opposition after its poor election result in September may have been sincere, and even strategically sound.
在其最新报告中，中国人民银行敦促中国公司把收购外国企业作为中国资本市场管制放松十年计划的第一步，而这一目标也是美国决策者早就制定了的。	In a recent report, the People’s Bank of China urged Chinese companies to acquire foreign firms as the first stage of a ten-year plan to ease China’s capital-market restrictions – long a goal of US policymakers.
同样的局面也出现在巴基斯坦的史瓦特河谷（Swat Valley ） 。 2009年，史瓦特河谷被军事接管，在几个月的时间里，这一地区都无法进入。	A similar outcome was observed in Pakistan’s Swat Valley after the militant takeover of 2009 rendered the region inaccessible for months.
我相信，俄罗斯应该明白无误地声明、而且国际社会应该明白无误地对俄罗斯声明，俄罗斯的边界是确定的、不会受到怀疑，因为边界争议时大多数冲突和战争的根源。	Russia, I believe, should clearly say – and the international community should clearly say to Russia – that it has defined borders that will not be questioned, because disputed borders lie at the core of most conflicts and wars.
由于人从根据理想行动中获得满足，他们的行为不仅仅是为了获取（acquire ） ， 也是为了成为（become ） 。	And, because people derive satisfaction from behaving in accordance with the ideal, they behave not just to acquire, but also to become.
我们拥有知识、专业技术和伙伴关系，可以对世界各地的生物多样性保护产生真正非常积极的影响，我们欢迎来自社会各界的支持，帮助我们实现这个目标。	We have the knowledge, expertise, and partnerships to make a very real positive difference to biodiversity conservation worldwide, and we welcome support from all parts of society to help us deliver this.
至少她的命运看上去要比戈森强。 戈森在乘坐私人飞机降落东京后被捕，现面临挪用公款、通过隐性薪酬中饱私囊数百万美元的指控。	At least her fate looks to be better than that of Ghosn, who was arrested in Tokyo when he landed there in a private jet, and now faces accusations that he misappropriated company funds and paid himself millions of dollars in hidden compensation.
毕竟 ， “ 随着现代化和重组的实际支出数字的增加，并有公私合作计划（其价值将根据未来私有化的可能性而得到提升）的助推，资产价值应该有更大的增加 。 ”	After all, “asset values should increase by more than the actual amount spent on modernization and restructuring, aided by a program of public-private partnerships whose value is boosted according to the probability of future privatization.”
事实上，全球经济正日益向知识经济转变，一国人民的教育和技能对于保证国家未来的意义比以往任何时候都更加重大。	In fact, with the global economy becoming increasingly knowledge-based, the education and skills of a country’s people are more important than ever in securing its future.
如果让鳕鱼处于自然生态环境，它们至少能存活三十年；可是一旦进入渔场，它们死在渔民手里的可能性比其他所有导致死亡的原因累加起来都要大。 这可以说是人类开发海洋生物资源高效性的有力证明。	It is a testament to the great efficiency with which we exploit living marine resources that fish like cod are now much more likely to die at the hands of fishermen than for all other reasons put together, once they get into the fisheries.
Uber只是颠覆性创新大幅提高效率、同时带来实际社会和制度挑战的一个实例。 法国经济部长伊曼纽尔·马克隆在经济论坛会议讲话中重点强调了这一问题。	Uber is just one example of disruptive innovation that brings huge increases in efficiency, as well as real social and regulatory challenges, a point that French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron emphasized in his speech at Rencontres Économiques.
如今，新任金融市场委员、英国的希尔勋爵（Lord Jonathan Hill）不可避免地承担了给出这一计划细节的任务。	Now, the new financial markets commissioner, the United Kingdom's Lord Jonathan Hill, has been assigned the unenviable task of putting flesh on bare bones.
人类需要学习新方法制造和使用低碳能源、可持续地种植粮食、建设宜居城市、治理全球共有的海洋、生物多样性和大气。	Humanity needs to learn new ways to produce and use low-carbon energy, grow food sustainably, build livable cities, and manage the global commons of oceans, biodiversity, and the atmosphere.
事实上，国际货币基金组织（IMF）最近报告，发展中国家因为BEPS行为而蒙受的公司税收入损失是发达国家的三倍。	Indeed, the International Monetary Fund recently reported that developing countries lose three times more of their corporate-tax revenue to BEPS activities than their developed counterparts.
我的组织在乌克兰的最新经验表明，媒体素养方面的正式训练也许是赢得有政治动机的国家支持的宣传战的最佳策略。	And, as my organization’s recent experience in Ukraine demonstrates, formal training in media literacy may be the best means of winning the war on state-sponsored, politically motivated propaganda.
另一方面，如果欧洲央行更想让主要国家（如意大利）对其债务违约，那么欧元可能会进一步贬值，因为投资者会担心违约将蔓延。	On the other hand, if the ECB preferred to let major countries, such as Italy, default on their debts, this would likely weaken the euro even further, as investors feared a contagion of defaults.
她们并没有把自己的斗争看作是男女之间的文化或意识形态冲突，而恰恰看成是使自己避免暴力和性侵害、被迫早婚和焚妻、以及法律不平等的一项实际的工作。	They did not see their struggle as a cultural or ideological clash between men and women, but rather as a very practical effort to live free from violence and sexual assault, forced child marriage and bride-burning, and legal exclusion from parity.
这次恐怖袭击可能是由巴基斯坦的恐怖组织虔诚军(Lashkar e Taiba ) — —它是一个由对世俗印度的仇恨支撑着并受到阴暗的巴基斯坦机构和街头组织支持的恐怖组织。	It is likely that this operation was propelled from Pakistan through the Lashkar e Tauba, a terrorist organization sustained by hatred of secular India and backed by shadowy Pakistani agencies and street support.
在欧盟正在承受看似无休无止的欧元区主权债务危机所���来的痛苦并且对未来决策架构的探讨已经迫在眉睫的情况下，EADS和BAE的合并失败恐怕仅仅是历史书上的一个脚注。	With the EU in the throes of the seemingly endless eurozone sovereign-debt crisis and facing a looming debate over its future decision-making architecture, the collapse of the EADS-BAE merger will be no more than a footnote in the history books.
首先，经济学教学与研究被建立在奖励正统、惩罚异类的制度结构基础上 — — 这与许多意识形态运动十分相似。	For starters, economics teaching and research is deeply embedded in an institutional structure that, as with any ideological movement, rewards orthodoxy and penalizes heresy.
林文夫和神原英资 — — 实际上几乎所有的日本经济学家 — — 已经或多或少地就如此壮观停滞的根本原因达成了共识： 日本人已经不再奋力工作。	Hayashi and Sakakibara – indeed, most Japanese economists – more or less agree on the fundamental reason for such spectacular stagnation: the Japanese have stopped working hard.
类似地，非洲各经济体本身之间的差异日益扩大，因此，应该根据各自的经济政策的利弊，对它们进行单独的评估。	Similarly, African economies are increasingly differentiating themselves, and should thus be evaluated individually, on the merits of their respective economic policies.
该项条款的支持者们辩护说这不会对像美国这样拥有良好法治的国家产生什么不利后果，并将促进对越南这类法治不完善国家的投资。	Proponents defend ISDS by saying that it will not have much consequence for countries, such as the US, where there is good rule of law, and that it will promote investment in countries, such as Vietnam, where there is not.
从地域上看，菲永几乎在除朱佩波尔多大本营以外的所有地区获胜，包括地中海南部的普罗旺斯-阿尔卑斯-蓝色海岸（PACA ） ， 该地区原本是萨科奇的坚定支持者。	Geographically, Fillon won almost everywhere outside of Juppé’s Bordeaux bastion, including the southern Mediterranean Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (PACA) region, which was originally Sarkozy’s strongest base of support.
近年来，比特币，以太坊和其他加密货币已经与价格波动，猖獗的投机以及 — — 不瞒您说 — — 大量盗窃行为联系在一起。	Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies have become associated in recent years with price volatility, rampant speculation, and – to be frank – a great deal of theft.
宏观经济模型均值表明从2020年到本世纪末的每一年，欧盟气候政策的总成本将高达2090亿欧元（合2800亿美元 ） 。	The average of macroeconomic models indicates that the total cost of the EU’s climate policy will be €209 billion ($280 billion) per year from 2020 until the end of the century.
保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）和伊尔哈南·赫普曼（Elhanan Helpman）引入了以往被忽视的不完全竞争和规模随回报提升等因素。	Paul Krugman and Elhanan Helpman introduced the previously neglected elements of imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale.
他关于哺乳动物完全无性生殖的推论 — — 更不用说他使用了“无原罪怀胎”一词来形容上述过程 — — 引发了公众关于科学家是否应当“扮演上帝”的忧虑。	His speculation about complete parthenogenesis in mammals – not to mention his use of the term “immaculate conception” to describe the process – prompted public concern about whether scientists should be “playing God.”
"大公司甚至没有把非洲放在他们考虑外包地点的版图上 "" ， 山布•马卡洛如是说。 他是马里人，正企图说服美国雇主将服务性工作转移到非洲 。 """	"""Big corporations don't even have Africa on the map when they consider outsourcing locations,"" says Sambou Makalou, a native of Mali who tries to persuade US employers to shift service jobs to Africa."
3月26日，四国领导人将在南非 — — 该国于2010年加入金砖四国行列 — — 举行了第五届金砖国家峰会，届时，这些国家的进步和潜力将会得到重新评估。	When the four countries’ leaders gather on March 26 in South Africa – which joined their ranks in 2010 – for the fifth BRICS summit, their progress and potential will be reassessed.
这不但要求与哈马斯实现停火，还要恢复巴勒斯坦民族联合政府，因为只有它能够提供今天的和平进程所缺乏的重要的合法性。	This requires not only a cease-fire with Hamas, but also a return to a Palestinian national unity government that alone can offer the peace process the vital legitimacy that it lacks today.
智利的国家公共投资系统（National Public Investment System）用标准格式、流程和打分项目评估所有计划公共项目 — — 拒绝率高达35 % 。	And Chile’s National Public Investment System evaluates all proposed public projects using standard forms, procedures, and metrics – and rejects as many as 35%.
我们也明白融合过程中找到工作的重要性，知道怎样更好地识别移民的技能，知道怎样为他们提供正确的语言培训，知道怎样克服招聘中的歧视。	We know how to recognize immigrants’ skills better, and how to provide the right kind of vocational training. We know how to ward off discrimination in hiring.
但这种对裙带关系的厌恶不合逻辑 — — 李光耀一般而言极重逻辑，甚至为此到了不讲情面的地步 — — 因为他本人对新加坡的分析能顺理成章地告诉人们他为什么要这样做。	Yet this abhorrence of nepotism was illogical – and Lee was generally nothing if not logical, even ruthlessly so – because in this case a perfectly good justification for it followed smoothly from his own analysis of Singapore.
而如果提供无限支持的话，每一个投机者都会被制服，也无需承受任何损失（因此支撑一个弱势货币的干涉手段也能获得成功 ） 。	With unlimited support, by contrast, every single speculator could be quashed, and no loss would be borne (since intervention to support a weak currency would succeed).
航空公司经理 — — 称为“财务高手 ” — —不知道陶器的价格，他需要开动脑筋来确定恰当的赔偿数字。	Because the airline manager – known as the “financial wizard” – has no idea what the price of the pottery is, a creative solution is needed to determine the appropriate amount of compensation.
一国要想平稳取消盯住汇率，唯有在人们对其经济充满信心时着手，让人们相信根据弹性的汇率既可以贬值，也可以升值。	Countries can exit a pegged rate smoothly only when there is confidence in the economy, encouraging the belief that the more flexible exchange rate can appreciate as well as weaken.
由欧洲人担任IMF总裁或许也是去年年底IMF决定将人民币加入决定其特别提款权价值的货币篮子的有利因素之一。	The leadership of a European managing director probably facilitated the IMF’s decision late last year to add China’s renminbi to the basket of currencies underpinning its Special Drawing Rights.
用《经济学人 》 （ Economist）的话说 ， “ 国大党 … … 四面楚歌 ” ， “面临长期衰落 … … 的危险 ” 。	According to The Economist: “The Congress Party…is in a funk” and “in danger of…long-term decline.”
鉴于欧洲货币联盟的架构，没有政府来监管欧洲央行，虽然也有相关约束条件对具体政策进行限制，但也同时存在“目标独立”和“工具独立 ” 。	Given the structure of the European Monetary Union, there is no government oversight of the ECB, which thus has both “target independence” and “instrument independence,” though restrictions preclude specific policies.
中国的一党领导的政治体制在实现强劲增长方面非常高效，但如今则必须应对日益蔓延的腐败和官僚主义，因为这些不但排挤了私人部门，还遏制了创新。	In China, the one-party system has been effective in delivering strong growth, but it must now address the rampant corruption and excessive bureaucracy that has crowded out the private sector and limited creativity and innovation.
从历史上说，像政府或者投资级别的债券等那样的低风险资产以及类似股票和房地产等那样的高风险资产之间的预期回报率差异非常高。	Historically, the gap between expected returns on low-risk assets like government or investment-grade bonds and high-risk assets like stocks and real estate has been very high.
国际社会必须清楚地表明中国的利益会在缅甸向更开放的社会转型的过程中得到保护，并且任何一个新政权都会支持某种形式的输油管道项目。	The international community must make clear that China’s interests would be protected during a transition to a more open society in Burma, and that some version of the oil pipeline project will be supported by any new regime.
对于像我们这些声称与凯恩斯主义的传统有某种关联的人来说，现在是一个胜利的时刻，毕竟在过去三十多年里，我们一直被遗忘甚至被回避。	For those of us who claimed some connection to the Keynesian tradition, this is a moment of triumph, after having been left in the wilderness, almost shunned, for more than three decades.
以巴西和阿根廷为例，两国分别已加大对中国的农产品出口，而中美洲和墨西哥则大幅提升了对中国产品的进口量。	Brazil and Argentina have, for example, significantly increased agricultural exports to China, while Central America and Mexico have seen their imports from China increase dramatically.
不丹人可以从印度带入少量香烟和烟叶供自己使用，但不允许进行销售 — — 而且在公共场合吸烟时必须随时携带进口税完税凭证。	Bhutanese may bring into the country small quantities of cigarettes or tobacco from India for their own consumption, but not for resale – and they must carry the import-tax receipt with them any time they smoke in public.
我们迫切呼吁希腊在和平进程中扮演更加建设性的角色，详细说明与土耳其实现关系正常化的好处，明确支持这个国家获得欧盟成员资格。	Greece is urgently called upon to play a more constructive role in the peace process by explaining the benefits of its own normalization of relations with Turkey and its support for that country’s EU membership.
今年夏天，对政府和传统政客的深恶痛绝像龙卷风一样席卷整个总统竞争，一些曾被视为资深竞争者的选战一败涂地。	Revulsion at government and traditional politicians hit the presidential contest like a tornado in the summer, flattening the campaigns of some who were once seen as serious contenders.
在欧尔班的领导下，匈牙利不仅违反难民待遇人权公约而且镇压民间社会，尤其是那些资金来自国外的民间组织。	Under Orbán’s leadership, breaches of human-rights conventions in the treatment of refugees have been accompanied by a crackdown on civil society, particularly on organizations that receive money from outside the country.
文化差异不会也不应当消失，但如果民众自身学会接受文化差异，那么民粹主义分子利用它们作为政治武器的图谋就不会成功。	Cultural differences will not and should not disappear, but if the people themselves have learned to live with them, populists will not succeed in using them as political weapons.
1963年冷战最高峰时，美国总统肯尼迪和苏联领导人赫鲁晓夫成功地达成了有限禁止核试验条约（1979 seizure of America’s embassy in Tehran，LTBT ） ， 这给了我们一个很有裨益的例子。	The success of US President John F. Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in reaching the 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, at the height of the Cold War, provides an instructive lesson.
我所建立的基金网与 2005 年启动的“罗姆人融入社会十年”项目合作，与世界银行结成联盟，将世行的罗姆人教育计划转移到新近成立的罗姆人教育基金之中。	In conjunction with the launch of the Decade of Roma Inclusion in 2005, my foundation network formed an alliance with the World Bank and transferred its Roma educational programs to a newly established Roma Education Fund.
（有的时候足球场上的胜利会与“真的”历史混淆在一起；高傲的荷兰队在1974年的世界杯上被德国队击败的历史也需要得到补偿。 ）	(Sometimes football history gets mixed up with “real” history; the defeat of a superior Dutch team by Germany in the World Cup final of 1974 also needed to be redressed.)
尽管我们不知道仍被劫持的女孩的未来，但在57名获救的女孩中，有15名已经回到学校，勇敢地面对博科圣地再次袭击学校、绑架更多学生的危险。	While we cannot know the future for the girls still in captivity, 15 of the 57 girls who escaped their kidnappers are now back at school, braving Boko Haram’s threats to return and abduct more students.
这一伙伴计划极大提升日本的贸易前景，包括像在农业这样的敏感部门，因为像鲜花和蔬菜之类快速消费品的出口将因此而受益。	The TPP would improve Japan’s trade prospects considerably, including in sensitive sectors like agriculture, where exports of fast-moving consumer goods like flowers and vegetables would benefit.
然而，从长远来看，要解决毛泽东极权主义的方法就是建立更宽广更包容的民主制度，一个生机勃勃享有自由的新闻界，以及公民自由。	In the long run, however, the answer to Maoist totalitarianism is greater and more inclusive democracy, a vibrant free press, and civil liberties.
其发展不平衡也变得更严重 — — 投资占GDP的比重接近50 % ， 而私人消费占GDP的比重还不到35 % 。	Its imbalances have gotten worse as well, with the investment share of GDP approaching 50% and private consumption falling below 35% of GDP.
治理不善限制了一国建设创造持久财富和生产力的能力 — — 即使这些短处要到繁荣破灭时才会显现和形成伤害。	Poor governance limits a country’s ability to create lasting wealth and productive capacity – even if the shortcomings become evident and damaging only when booms turn to busts.
亚洲领导人应该认识到，私人基础设施项目融资的缺乏不是一两个问题那么简单，他们应该寻找全面的解决方案彻底解决这一挑战。	It is time for Asia’s leaders to recognize that the lack of private funding for infrastructure projects cannot be reduced to one or even two problems, and to develop comprehensive solutions that account for the full scope of the challenge.
其霸权受到了更激进的伊斯兰圣战组织（Islamic Jihad，仍是伊朗的盟友）和其他一系列沙拉菲派和其他圣战组织的挑战，其中一些与西奈的激进分子有关联，这使得哈马斯与埃及的关系复杂化了。	Its hegemony is challenged by the more radical Islamic Jihad (which remains allied with Iran) and a host of Salafi and jihadi groups, some connected to radical elements in Sinai, which complicates Hamas’s relations with Egypt.
但是，德国作为首席债权人的地位让其取得了领头羊的位置，如今，德国总理默克尔政府正在寻求建立一个更加德国的欧洲。	But, with Germany’s position as creditor-in-chief having thrust it into the driver’s seat, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration now seeks to create a more Germanic Europe.
由于肯尼迪和赫鲁晓夫过人的冷静，再加上一些好运气，人类最终得到了救赎；苏联撤出了导弹，美国也承诺不会再次发动入侵。	Through dazzling restraint by both Kennedy and Khrushchev, and no small measure of good luck, humanity was spared; the Soviet missiles were removed, and the US pledged not to launch another invasion.
正如纽约的对外关系委员会前主席Leslie Gelb最近说的那样，欧洲和美国的领导人已经丧失了严肃合作的传统。	As Leslie Gelb, the former president of The Council on Foreign Relations in New York, recently remarked, leaders in Europe and the US have lost the habit of serious cooperation.
现在，作为撒哈拉以南非洲国家经济引擎和最先进的大学、媒体以及公司所在地的南非，拥有了一位曾经当过牧羊人的领导人 — — 一位罕见的具有平易近人品质的非洲领导人。	Now South Africa, the region’s economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities, media, and corporations, has a former goat herder at its helm, a rare African leader with the common touch.
但对那些想要理解成功和虐待行为之间显性关系的心理学家来说，韦恩斯坦显而易见的垮台仅仅是揭开了分析冰山的一角。	But for psychologists seeking to understand the apparent nexus of success and abuse, Weinstein’s apparent downfall is just the tip of an analytic iceberg.
最近冰岛的巨额贸易赤字和巴西新任财政部长所引发的波澜，触动了世界的敏感神经，并提醒全球投资家们：虽然有很多新兴市场正逐渐向投资级的地位迈进，但大多数却仍然长路漫漫。	Recent jitters about Iceland’s gaping trade deficit and Brazil’s new finance minister rippled around the world, reminding global investors that while many emerging markets are gradually moving towards investment-grade status, most are not there yet.
在国内，政府基本上放弃了将主权持仓多样化、实现多重“口袋”以反映激进多样化的投资目标和广泛的政治考虑的努力。	Domestically, governments have largely abandoned their efforts to divide sovereign holdings into multiple “pockets” that reflected the funds’ diverse investment objectives and wider political considerations.
那么让我们转而支持一个公平贸易的经济模式，拒绝在那些受到反不公平雇佣运动人士锁定的商店购物(更多信息，请查阅http : / /www.worldwatch.org/node/1485 ) 。	Let us support a fair-trade economy, and refuse to shop at outlets targeted by activists for unfair employment practices (for more information, go to http://www.worldwatch.org/node/1485).
那么那些全球化的批评者 — — 那些错误地将其视为零和游戏的人 — — 是否就是反对消除全球贫困的呢？	Are globalization’s critics – those who wrongly consider it a zero-sum game – against eradicating global poverty?
那么，法国和德国的领导人们又为何如此奋力去阻止 — — 或者更精确地说，拖延 — — 这件必将发生的事件？	Why, then, are political leaders in France and Germany trying so hard to prevent – or, more accurately, to postpone – the inevitable?
伊拉克在20世纪80年代对伊朗使用过生化武器，埃及60年代在也门使用过，伊拉克对其国内的库尔德人也使用过。	Iraq used them against Iran in the 1980’s, Egypt in Yemen in the 1960’s, and Iraq against its own Kurds.
新德里 — — 在新任主席习近平领导下，中国是否正在谋求与美国“亚洲核心”政策相对应的外交核心政策？	NEW DELHI – Is China, under its new president, Xi Jinping, undertaking its own diplomatic pivot, parallel to the United States’ “pivot to Asia”?
不久以后，许多国家都会去占领月球，从而引发我们在南极洲所碰到的同样令人不快的暂时性的状况：即各个国家在未合法拥有的情况下悍然撷取其中的资源。	Soon nations will colonize the moon, giving rise to the same unsatisfactory and tentative situation we have in Antarctica, where nations essentially take without legally owning.
与那些回顾过往并得出结论认为这是房地产泡沫必然后果的人不同，金奈伊奥利和施莱夫认识到了应急措施在危机及其后果中发挥的核心作用。	Unlike those who look back and conclude that it was all an inevitable consequence of the housing bubble, Gennaioli and Shleifer recognize the central role that contingency played in the crisis and its aftermath.
例如在芬兰，十年以来的可持续性公共基金支持正对私人投资产生催化作用，从而促成了研发预算的规律性增长。	In Finland, for example, ten years of sustained public funding is now catalyzing private investments and fueling regular increases in R&D budgets.
毕竟，对自然资源课以高额税收不会让它们消失，这意味着以自然资源为主要收入来源的国家可以用它们来为教育、医疗、发展和再分配融资。	After all, taxing natural resources at high rates will not cause them to disappear, which means that countries whose major source of revenue is natural resources can use them to finance education, health care, development, and redistribution.
美国总统尼克松曾赞誉1971年代的史密森协定（Smithsonian Agreement）是“世界历史上最具意义的货币协定 。 ”	President Richard Nixon hailed the 1971 Smithsonian agreement as “the most significant monetary agreement in the history of the world.”
拜我们和其他类似的项目所赐，难民能够 利用这段时间获得宝贵的技能乃至职业能力倾向的认证评估，为进入就业市场做好准备。	Thanks to our initiative and others like it, refugees can use this time to prepare to enter the job market, by gaining valuable skills, not to mention a certified assessment of their occupational aptitude.
虽然在中央银行的货币注入下还能继续维持一段时间，但市场参与者最终会意识到没有足够的储蓄去完成所有投资，于是泡沫开始破灭。	But market participants eventually realize that there are not enough savings to complete all the investment projects. At that point, boom turns to bust.
墨西哥城－虽然许多美国人认为，移民是一个不应该包含在与其他政府会谈中的国内问题，但是，这并不是其他国家持有的观点 — — 也不是美国持有的观点。	MEXICO CITY – Although many Americans believe immigration is a domestic issue that should be excluded from talks with other governments, this is not a view held by other nations – or by the United States.
历史上，中国的出口拉动增长战略取得了巨大的成功，再加上以中国为中心的全球供给链的快速成长，共同构成了我从来不信什么脱钩论的主要原因。	Historically, China’s hugely successful export-led growth strategy, together with the rapid growth of China-centric global supply chains, was the major reason why I never bought the decoupling story.
自由市场固然能指引世界走向更富裕、更健康的未来，但相信斯密的“看不见的手”能赢得与气候变化的斗争将是一个悲剧性的错误。	While free markets may have steered much of the world toward a wealthier, healthier future, placing our faith in Smith’s “invisible hand” to win the fight against climate change would be a tragic mistake.
但浮出的一个共同的模式是，因为圣战的信息所承诺的意义和身份，它们似乎对那些搞不清楚他们是谁和他们要去哪里的人特别具有吸引力。	But one common pattern that does emerge is that the jihadi message, because it promises meaning and identity, seems to appeal particularly to people who are unsure about who they are and where they are heading.
假定金正恩是理性的，那么他一定有很好的理由认为，即使他处决了中国所喜欢的朝鲜传话人，仍能够维持中国生命线。	Assuming that Kim is rational, he must have had good reason to believe that the Chinese lifeline would be sustained, even if he executed China’s favorite North Korean interlocutor.
它应该处于国际金融市场的中心，并且不仅仅为各国中央银行和财政部、同样也为监管机关、标准制定者以及市场参与者提供分析平台。	It should be positioned at the center of international financial markets and provide an analytical platform, not only for central banks and finance ministries, but also for regulators, standard setters, and market participants.
但这份公报也旋即成为了他信反对者手中的致命武器，而其中的领导势力则是泰国人民民主联盟（简称民盟 ） 。	The communiqué became a lightning rod for Thaksin’s opponents at home, spearheaded by the People’s Alliance for Democracy.
就算是拥有长期合作历史的欧洲各国，其互相之间贷款安排的监测（surveillance）和贷款条件（conditionality）的拟定等职能也是外包给IMF的。	Even in Europe, with its long history of cooperation, surveillance and conditionality are outsourced to the IMF.
但这些非常规政策正在转变为经典的博弈论坏均衡：每个央行都能从保持低利率中获利，但从集体角度，它们的方针却构成了一个陷阱。	But these unconventional policies are turning out to be a classic game-theoretic bad equilibrium: each central bank stands to gain by keeping interest rates low, but, collectively, their approach constitutes a trap.
但卡梅伦的保守党及其自身的内阁也陷入了深深的分歧，而伦敦的民粹主义市长鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）已经加入支持英国退出阵营。	But Cameron’s Conservative Party and his own cabinet are deeply divided, while London’s populist mayor, Boris Johnson, has joined the supporters of British exit.
在全球化降低了将生产和服务岗位从富国转移到穷国的难度后，不断发展的自动化正威胁将工作从人转到机器人手中。	After globalization made it easier to move manufacturing and service jobs from rich to poor countries, growing automation now threatens to move jobs from humans to robots.
在这一切发生了之后，俄副总理伊戈尔·谢琴与国防部长阿纳托利·谢尔久科夫就被派到吉尔吉斯斯坦首都比什凯克，试图为俄方挽回点利益。	Soon after this, Russian Vice Premier Igor Sechin and Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov were sent to Bishkek in an effort to get something for Russia’s money.
经济学 — — 市场如何运作，为何有时会崩溃，如何合理估算项目的成本 — — 应该符合大部分人的利益。	Economics – how markets works, why they sometimes break down, how to estimate the costs of a project properly – ought to be of interest to most people.
许多英国政策制定者 — — 以及“脱欧”运动的所有成员 — — 都忽视了退出欧盟单一市场所可能产生的成本。	Many UK policymakers – and all members of the “Leave” campaign – are ignoring the likely costs of exiting the EU single market.
与显然为寻求快速贸易“胜利”而放弃经济逻辑的美国不同，欧盟是一家动作迟缓的机构，往往更加看重经济逻辑而非地缘政治并更加偏爱长期协议。	Unlike the US – which has apparently abandoned economic logic in its search for quick “wins” on trade – the EU is a slow-moving entity that generally prioritizes economic logic above geopolitical considerations and favors long-term agreements.
当今的核电站使用一种特殊的铀元素（铀235）作为燃料，通过从一个原子核裂变反应中释放中子并引发另一原子核裂变的链式反应来产生能量。	Today’s power plants use as a fuel a special kind of Uranium, U-235, which is burned in a chain process whereby the neutrons from one nuclear decay induce the next decay.
在做出这些投资的同时，决策者也绝不能忘记近期非洲的大部分增长要归因于良好的宏观经济政策和可靠的经济管理。	As they make these investments, policymakers must not forget that much of Africa’s recent growth can be credited to good macroeconomic policies and sound economic management.
要回答这个问题，需要可能影响公众对经济的思考 — — 或避免思考 — — 的现有叙事和观念的大致特征（impressionistic characterizations ） 。	To answer it requires impressionistic characterizations of the extant stories and ideas that might influence public thinking – or avoidance of thinking – about the economy.
上述战略的基本主旨不出所料，中国改变投资结构，从出口主导的经济增长模式向着更平衡的消费和服务经济转型。	There were no surprises in the basic thrust of the strategy – a structural shift in China’s investment- and export-led growth model toward a more balanced consumer-based and services-led economy.
越来越“社会主义”的AfD背后的推动力可以从德国东部寻找，图林根州的煽动政党领导人比约恩·霍克（Björn Höcke）等人早就要求“ 一个爱国团结的党 ” 。	The driving forces behind a more “socialist” AfD can be found in Germany’s east, where firebrand party leaders like Björn Höcke of Thuringia have long called for “a party of patriotism and solidarity.”
这“可能包括将汇总的遗传和自我报告信息向第三方非盈利和/或商业研究伙伴披露，但这些信息不会发表在同行评议的科学期刊上 。 ”	This “may include disclosure of Aggregated Genetic and Self-Reported Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.”
尽管如此，就算是个象征性的姿态，布什将朝鲜移除名单的决定与特朗普将其重新列入名单的决定有着完全不同的背景。	Still, even as a symbolic gesture, the context of Bush’s decision to remove North Korea from the list was entirely different from that of Trump’s decision to restore it.
最后，继2014年挑起克里姆林与西方不和的俄罗斯吞并克里米亚行动后，土耳其在俄欧双方之间取得了战略优势地位。	Finally, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, which drove a wedge between the Kremlin and the West, Turkey had carved out a strategically advantageous position between the two sides.
半个世纪以前，自由市场经济学家弗·冯·哈耶克（Friedrich von Hayek）提出，大型公共部门将威胁民主本身，将欧洲国家置于“受奴役的地位 ” 。	Half a century ago, the free-market economist Friedrich von Hayek argued that a large public sector would threaten democracy itself, putting European countries on a “road to serfdom.”
如果现在美联储认为经济具备了更大的不引起剧烈通胀的超趋势扩张容量，那么，用约翰·列侬（John Lennon）的话说，可以“给增长一个机会 ” 。	If the Fed now believes that the economy has greater capacity for above-trend expansion without generating much inflation, it can, to paraphrase John Lennon, “give growth a chance.”
当然，这番话也遭到了质疑和批评，但与前任工党首相遭到劈头盖脸的抗议，要求其为经济陷入困境负责的遭遇不同的是，外界对这番声明的回应相当客气，也非常理智。	And, of course, there have been demurrals and criticisms. But, aside from former Labour ministers, protesting bitterly at being blamed for the state of the economy, the response has been remarkably civil and thoughtful.
发生在2006至2007年间的种族清洗是可怕的，但它使逊尼派暴乱分子无法藏身也无法与其他居民杂居，也切断了他们的后勤和财政方面的来源。	The ethnic cleansing of many Baghdad neighborhoods in 2006 and 2007 was deplorable.
其次，它还必须确保一体化程度不断增强的欧元区无权单方面出台财政和监管决策，通过重塑统一市场或金融行业而严重影响到英国。	Second, it must ensure that an increasingly integrated eurozone does not gain the authority to make unilaterally fiscal and regulatory decisions that, by reshaping the single market or the financial sector, have significant implications for the UK.
为在结核病领域实现恰当的平衡，国际社会必须通过向外界展示9月所达成的 财务领导协议来重新致力于研发活动。	To strike the right balance with TB, the international community must recommit to R&D initiatives by showing the financial leadership agreed upon in September.
受损严重的经济体能看见独立复苏的有限前景，它们会拒绝接受国际合作带来的机会，这一观点可能无法令人信服。	Perhaps the idea that severely damaged economies, with limited prospects for independent recoveries, would pass up the opportunity that international cooperation presented was implausible.
我们的分析显示，一切照旧模式不会在2030年前在实现可持续发展目标领域取得显著进展，也无法提高环境的可持续性。	The business-as-usual scenario, our analysis shows, would not bring significant progress toward achieving the SDGs or boosting environmental sustainability by 2030.
马德里和华沙示威之间的差别表明新旧欧洲之间的区分依然有效 — — 虽然已经不是拉姆斯菲尔德的原意了。	The differences between the demonstrations in Madrid and Warsaw suggest that the distinction between Old and New Europe remains valid, though not in the way that Rumsfeld meant.
批判性思想越来越被作为精英主义行为嗤之以鼻，而不负责任的社交媒体 ， “ 假新闻”和“另类事实”则主导着民众探讨。	Critical thought is increasingly dismissed as an elitist endeavor, while unaccountable social media, “fake news,” and “alternative facts” dominate public discussion.
但修辞的变化并没有带来战略改变，奥巴马政府仍然超越了安全顾虑的边界，利用其反恐活动为美国更宽泛的地缘政治利益服务。	But the rhetorical shift did not translate into a change in strategy, with the Obama administration moving beyond security concerns to use its anti-terrorism activities to advance America’s broader geopolitical interests.
希格斯和他的同事们提出就像数学模型所要求的那样，单个基本粒子的质量的确为零，因此所有粒子通常都会以光速向四周运动。	Higgs and his colleagues suggested that every elementary particle really is massless, just as the mathematical models require, and hence all particles would ordinarily zip around at the speed of light.
事实上，你可能会对总统有一个左右逢源的助手而对他抱有一丝同情，科恩就是如此 — — 他让他的痛苦众所周知，但并没有因为痛苦而做出什么行动。	Actually, one can have some sympathy for a president with an aide who wants to have it both ways, as Cohn did – letting his apparent anguish be known without acting on it.
纽黑文—如果你想寻找一个说明金融市场为何如此难以良好地运转的完美例子，你只需要看看围绕美国众筹（crowdfunding）所出现的困难和争议就行了。	NEW HAVEN – If one were seeking a perfect example of why it’s so hard to make financial markets work well, one would not have to look further than the difficulties and controversies surrounding crowdfunding in the United States.
外交政策在这次大选中还很少露脸，但据估计最后一次辩论将以此为主题，从而向选民们展示两位候选人是如何看待世界的。	Foreign policy has made few appearances in the campaign, but the final debate is supposed to be devoted to the subject, thereby giving voters a sustained view of how the candidates view the world.
事实上，同样的步骤早就在2006年时的泰国和2007年的缅甸付诸实施 — — 只不过是泰国用了10天而缅甸用了7天而以。	These same ten steps occurred in Thailand in 2006 – in ten days, and in seven days in Myanmar a year later.
当西方给予莫布图（Mobutu）资金时，他们知道钱款进入了瑞士的银行账户，而并没有用于赈济扎伊尔（现刚果）人民。	When the West gave money to Mobutu, they knew that the funds were going to Swiss bank accounts rather than benefiting the people of Zaire (now Congo).
塔克认为，在理想状态下那些关键问题 — — 比如说管理所谓“大而不能倒”的银行 — — 应该交由国会一级决定，因为这在某种程度上需要更多的透明度以及真正的问责制。	Ideally, in Tucker’s view, vital issues – like how much to regulate so-called too-big-to-fail banks – should be decided at the congressional level, in part because this implies more transparency and real accountability.
在经历了近几年的下跌后，11月以来韩国贸易出现复苏信号，主要表现在出口增长上；1月份，韩国贸易数字强劲反弹。	After trending down in recent years, South Korean trade since November has shown signs of recovering, notably in terms of export growth; and in January, it bounced back significantly.
例如在德国，联邦政府的缩短工时（Kurzarbeit）项目规定如果一个劳动者因为工时缩短而导致收入下降超过10%时，政府将给予占该下降幅度相当一部份的补偿。	In Germany, for example, the federal government’s Kurzarbeit program makes up a significant fraction of the difference when, owing to short hours, a worker’s earnings fall by more than 10%.
然而，如果公众支持这种由规则向自由裁量权的转换，那么欧元区成员国的财政管理制度就必须服从于现实的市场原则。	If the public is to support such a shift toward discretion over rules, however, the system of fiscal governance for the eurozone members must be subject to real market discipline.
尽管如此，蒂尔森认为朝鲜准备和美国谈判的说法可能是对的 — — 但只能一个核武国家与另一个核武国家之间的谈判。	Nonetheless, Tillerson is probably right that North Korea is ready to talk to the United States – but only as one nuclear-weapons state to another.
美国似乎可以让世界充斥美元货币和债务，而不必为更高的通货膨胀或者利率而付出代价。 德斯坦对此十分气恼。	D’Estaing was incensed that the US seemed to be able to flood the world with dollar currency and debt without ever seeming to pay a price in terms of higher inflation or interest rates.
但当进一步数据分析显示该药对黑人患者的潜在疗效更为显著时，科研人员又针对1，050名现行疗法无效的自我认定的“黑人”严重心衰患者进行了新的试验。	But when more detailed analysis of the data revealed potentially elevated benefits for black patients, a new trial was performed on 1,050 self-identified “black” patients with severe heart failure for whom available treatments had proved ineffective.
亨利的方案，用他自己的话说 ， “ 因为不具备管理上的可行性或被视为无法对犯罪行为形成长期影响的短期行动而被否决 。 ”	Henry’s proposal was, in his own words, “dismissed as either administratively impractical or as a one-shot action that would have no long-run impact on criminal behavior.”
但是，尽管欧元区年轻人失业率自2009年以来有所上升，其失业比率一直保持稳定（但两者均远高于2008年的水平 ） 。	But, while the eurozone’s youth unemployment rate has increased since 2009, its ratio has remained the same (though both significantly exceed pre-2008 levels).
如今，地理因素仍起着作用，尽管让美国不愿就其言论自由状况大做文章的原因已不再是苏联，而是叙利亚、伊拉克和伊朗。	Today, geography still plays a role, though it is Turkey’s contiguity with Syria, Iraq, and Iran that has left the US reluctant to make a fuss about press freedom.
希腊人称之为民主的东西，在其他许多国家 — — 它们与希腊一样民主 — — 称之为不负责任的单边主义。	What the Greeks call democracy comes across in many other – equally democratic – countries as irresponsible unilateralism.
上周，来自163个国家的101位领袖召开会议，确定12月即将在哥本哈根召开的联合国气候变化会议的重要步骤。	Last week, 101 leaders from 163 countries met to chart the next steps toward December’s all-important UN climate change conference in Copenhagen.
显然，如果中国强劲的增长迎来一次暂停，将会造成新兴市场的地震，与之相比，今天新兴市场的波动只不过是打了个嗝。	Certainly, if there ever is a pause in China’s heady growth, today’s emerging-market turmoil will seem like a mere hiccup compared to the earthquake that will ensue.
世界其他部分的责任在于为寻找办法的努力提供稳定支持：构建一个所有国家都遵守同样的规则和范式的包容性国际体系。	The responsibility of the rest of the world is to build a stable backdrop for such efforts: an inclusive international system in which countries abide by the same rules and norms.
土耳其说，它已经花费了78亿美元用于照顾两百多万难民；而到目前为止，土耳其只获得了4.15亿美元来自其他国家的资金（尽管欧盟已承诺再支持30亿欧元 ） 。	Turkey says it has spent $7.8 billion to care for more than two million refugees; thus far, it has received only $415 million from others (though the EU has promised another €3 billion).
四年后，在卡塔尔多哈举行的第二届发展融资会议上，决策者承认在税收���题上做得不够，并要求ECOSOC考虑加强制度安排。	Four years later, at the Second Conference on Financing for Development, in Doha, Qatar, policymakers acknowledged that more needed to be done in tax matters, and asked ECOSOC to consider strengthening institutional arrangements.
但是，他们并没有试图抵挡经济从农业进步到工业再进步到服务业的自然演化，而是成功地让英国获得了整整一百年的持续经济增长。	But, by not standing in the way of the economy’s natural evolution from agriculture to industry and then to services, they enabled the United Kingdom to enjoy a full century of sustained economic growth.
电视上播放的战争造成的灾难，以及可以���特写镜头观察到残缺，可以并且也必须加以阻止，以免 — — 像在刚果经常发生的那样 — — 危机从新闻报道头版消失了，但是杀戮却以世人看不见的方式在继续。	The televised tragedy, and the shortcomings that can be observed close up, can and must be stopped, lest – as often happens with Congo – the crisis disappears from the front pages, while the killing continues unseen.
虽然苏联最后几个月里的经济条件非常可怕，但人们能够看到自由正在降临，并且和今天不同的是，他们都愿意为自由挺身而出。	Even though economic conditions were dire in the USSR’s final months, people could see the freedoms that were coming and, unlike today, were willing to stand up for them.
好消息是特朗普政府没有追求激进的保护主义政策，比如将某些国家列为货币操纵国、征收跨境关税，或推行边境调节税等。	The good news is that the administration has not pursued radically protectionist policies, such as branding countries as currency manipulators, introducing across-the-board tariffs, or pushing for the border adjustment tax.
今天的绿色经济并不是以反思经济学，将经济运行与环境极限和当务之急相适应，而是试图改造自然，让它来适应现有经济体系。	Instead of rethinking our economies with a view to adapting their functioning to environmental limits and imperatives, today’s green economy seeks to redefine nature, in order to adapt it to existing economic systems.
具体形式既可以是由美国国防部或美国国立卫生研究院（NIH）等机构直接出资，也可以采用税收减免、采购及学术实验室或研究中心补贴等间接形式。	The funding can be direct, through institutions like the Defense Department or the National Institutes of Health (NIH), or indirect, via tax breaks, procurement practices, and subsidies to academic labs or research centers.
首先，奥巴马并没有公开批评中国政府恶劣的人权纪录，也没有利用自己的影响力去劝告中国释放在押的政治犯，而这两点都是他的前任到访中国时常有的举动。	First, Obama did not openly criticize the Chinese government’s notorious human rights record, nor did he use his influence to persuade China to release any prisoner of conscience, as his US predecessors always did when visiting the country.
讽刺的是，随着加沙发射的火箭落在了特拉维夫郊区，那些支持分治的以色列人并不认为满足分治计划的另一半人有多重要。	It is ironic that, as rockets from Gaza reach the outskirts of Tel Aviv, those Israelis who celebrated the partition, and their descendants, do not see the importance of fulfilling the other half of the partition plan.
高技能、高薪酬岗位数量增加，特别是所谓的STEM领域（科学、技术、工程、数学 ） ， 目前仍有240万个岗位虚位以待。	The number of high-skill, well-paid jobs is increasing, particularly in so-called STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, math), where 2.4 million jobs remain unfilled.
如果达成全球共识 — — 比如通过G20或联合国大会达成 — — 选择对农业抗生素征税的国家可以用所得税收收入推动替代农业作业的转型。	If a global consensus were reached – for example, through the G20 or the United Nations General Assembly – countries choosing to tax agricultural antibiotics could use the revenue to help ease the transition to alternative farming practices.
说真的，按照欧盟委员会的估计，仅按它所酝酿的税率 — — 股票和债券交易的0.1 % 、 衍生品交易的0.01 % ， 有关财政每年便可增加500亿欧元进项。	Indeed, the European Commission estimates that its proposed tax of only 0.1% on stock and bond trades, and 0.01% tax on derivatives, will raise more than €50 billion per year.
此外，与阿富汗签订允许阿富汗货物过境运往印度的贸易协议可能是与这个高速发展的邻国改善经济关系的第一步。	Moreover, a trade agreement with Afghanistan that allows Afghan goods to cross Pakistan en route to India may be one step towards an improvement of economic relations with that large and rapidly growing neighbor.
尽管颁布有禁止“掠夺性”定价和“反竞争”并购的相关规定，但价格战和增加市场领导者支配力的收购行为在实际操作上也是被允许的。	Despite rules prohibiting “predatory” pricing and “anti-competitive” mergers, price wars and acquisitions that increase market leaders’ power are permitted in practice.
不无讽刺的是，伊朗的民用核计划会通过使更多的石油和天然气供应到全球市场从而增强美国和世界的能源安全。	Ironically, an Iranian civilian nuclear program would enhance US and world energy security by making more oil and gas available in the global market.
债券市场大亨布莱恩（Bill Blain）这样评论高盛的股票买入行为 ： “ 脑海中突然浮现出‘买在地位，稍稍上涨后卖掉，出货完毕逃之夭夭。 ’这句话 。 ”	As for Goldman’s equity play, as bond-market guru Bill Blain put it, “the words ‘buy cheap, sell a bit dearer on the up, and then dump and run’ spring to mind.”
该国同时还斥资数百万美元从身兼核科学家和黑市商人双重身份的“巴基斯坦核弹之父” 阿卜杜勒·卡迪尔·汗那里购买浓缩技术和核弹设计图纸。	The country has also spent millions of dollars on illegal purchases of enrichment technology and nuclear-weapon designs from the Pakistani nuclear scientist and black marketeer A.Q. Khan, the “Father of the Pakistani bomb.”
由于这一联系影响所有需要原材料投入的制造品，因此毫不奇怪，随着大宗商品价格下跌，全球贸易也跟着萎缩。	Given that this connection affects all manufactured goods that require raw material inputs, it should be no surprise that, as commodity prices have declined, so has global trade.
不幸的是，在过去20年中，针对劳动力市场的公共开支相对于GDP的比率在美国下降了0.5个百分点，在加拿大，德国和斯堪的纳维亚半岛地区下降了超过3个百分点。	Unfortunately, in the past two decades, public spending on labor markets, relative to GDP, has declined by 0.5 percentage points in the United States, and by more than three percentage points in Canada, Germany, and Scandinavia.
但是 ， “ 政府借钱越多，就必须掏更多的钱用于偿还它的借款”这样的说法有时是正确的，有时是错误的。	But the statement, “The more the government borrows, the more it has to pay for its borrowing,” is sometimes true and sometimes false.
事实上，教宗科学院的前身可以追溯到400等多年前的猞猁学院（Accademia dei Lincei ） ， 伽利略1661年开始在该学院任职。	Indeed, the founding of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences traces its origins back more than 400 years, to the Academy of Lynxes (Accademia dei Lincei), which inducted Galileo in 1611.
自然法传统提供了一个中世纪学者所熟悉的答案。 对他们来说，自然法可以通过我们的自然理性（natural reason）理解，相反，另外一些法律只能通过天启（divine revelation）发现 ） 。	The tradition of natural law offers an answer that was familiar to medieval scholars, for whom natural law was knowable to us by our natural reason (as opposed to those laws that could be discovered only through divine revelation).
因此今天，与其纠结美国制度能否在特朗普任职期间生存下来，我们必须搞清这套制度怎样才能服务于错误的目标。	So today, instead of asking whether American institutions will survive the Trump presidency, we must ask how American institutions can be put in the service of wrongful ends.
事实上，一些新兴经济体 — — 主要是受中国减速影响的石油和大宗商品生产国 — — 的严重金融问题与美联储的动作无关。	In fact, serious financial problems in several emerging economies – particularly oil and commodity producers exposed to the slowdown in China – are unrelated to what the Fed does.
伦敦—有记录表明巴西新外交部长欧内斯托·阿罗约（Ernesto Araújo）相信气候变化是一场“文化马克思主义者”发动的阴谋，意图破坏西方经济。	LONDON – Brazil’s new foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, is on record as believing that climate change is a plot launched by “cultural Marxists” to stifle Western economies.
毕竟，谁会容忍名义利率的零下限成为不可逾越的技术障碍，在创新性金融便利手段拯救华尔街的同时阻挡救助民生之路？	After all, how could one let a technical hitch like the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates stand in the way of rescuing Main Street when innovative financing facilities had been used to save Wall Street?
在联合国贸易和发展会议上，我们依靠一个新建立的56个发达和发展中国家上市公司数据库将研究延伸到了美国经济之外。	At the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), our research looks beyond the US economy, relying on a newly constructed database for publicly traded companies in 56 developed and developing countries.
在美国，30年国债收益率在1月30日创下了2.25%的历史低点（自1972年美联储系列债券诞生以来 ） 。	In the United States, the 30-year Treasury bond yield reached a record low (since the Federal Reserve series began in 1972) of 2.25% on January 30. The yield on the United Kingdom's 30-year government bond fell to 2.04% on the same day.
如果我们能够利用资金和政治意愿保证每个儿童，不论其收入、所在地或社会地位，都能学习，教育委员会就取得了成功。	The Education Commission will have succeeded if we are able to leverage the funding and political will to ensure that every child learns, regardless of their income, location, or social status.
富内斯是个温和左派， 不但把自己和巴西总统卢拉以及美国总统奥巴马相提并论，同时还反对委内瑞拉总统查韦斯。	He is a moderate, modern leftist who has openly identified himself with Brazilian President Lula and Barack Obama, as opposed to Chávez.
以色列和美国都非常怀念21世纪的民族国家世界，它们有这样的想法顺理成章，因为在那个世界里，它们所拥有的传统力量最容易发挥作用。	Both Israel and the US are nostalgic for a twentieth-century world of nation-states, which is understandable, since that is the world to which the kind of conventional power they possess is best suited.
像艾米尔·杜尔凯姆、费迪南德·托尼斯、格奥尔格·齐美尔等社会学巨擎很久以前就开始担忧从传统向现代社会的转型过程破坏了传统的支撑结构，导致社会中的个体感到被孤立和不快乐。	Giants of sociology, like Émile Durkheim, Ferdinand Tönnies, and Georg Simmel, worried long ago that the transition from traditional to modern society undermined traditional support structures and left individuals feeling isolated and unhappy.
美国人开始乐于接受总统奥巴马用来描述美国在利比亚扮演所边沿角色的话，即“从幕后领导 ” ， 或许对于其盟国而言，美国退得太多了。	Americans are starting to enjoy – probably too much for their allies – what President Barack Obama, describing the US role in Libya, called “leading from behind.”
自2009年中期大衰退结束以来，相同的情况发生过两次 — — 2010年第二季度和第三季度的年化增长率平均为3.4 % ； 2011年四季度和2012年一季度平均增长了4.3 % 。	The same thing has happened twice since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 – a 3.4% average annualized gain in the second and third quarters of 2010 and a 4.3% average increase in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012.
看起来，将如此多国家的如此多的部门包括进来更有利于克服抵制，因为这样能分散反对意见，防止任何一个特殊利益集团取得上风。	It seems that involving so many sectors in so many countries actually made it easier to overcome resistance, as it diffused the opposition and prevented any single specific interest from getting the upper hand.
几个世纪以来，大规模食物中毒事件的最大元凶往往是真菌毒素对未处理谷物的污染 — — 当昆虫侵袭农作物并造成伤口，令真菌（霉菌）得以附着之时，这一风险也随之急剧扩大。	Over the centuries, the main culprit in mass food poisoning often has been contamination of unprocessed crops by fungal toxins – a risk that is exacerbated when insects attack food crops, opening wounds that allow fungi (molds) to get a foothold.
政治领导人在必须就某事件作出反应之前的自由度越来越低了，而事件发生后，政治领导人不但要和其他政府沟通，也要和公民社会沟通。	Political leaders enjoy fewer degrees of freedom before they must respond to events, and must then communicate not only with other governments, but with civil society as well.
同样，被误导的财政紧缩政策既非不可避免，其与全球化之间的联系也并非是无法化解的 — — 尤其是调节短期资本流动的明智政策。	Likewise, misguided fiscal austerity is neither unavoidable nor inextricably linked to globalization – especially the smart kind that moderates short-term capital movements.
上述2015年联合国第三大胜利或许有助于实现第四大胜利：12月在联合国气候变化框架公约支持下在巴黎签署全球气候控制协议。	This, the UN’s third triumph of 2015, could help to bring about the fourth: a global agreement on climate control, under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Paris in December.
当然，支持快速城市发展需要大量的资本支出，以建设高效的运输、供水、固体废物管理、污水排放和处理系统。	Of course, financing rapid urban development requires significant capital outlays to build efficient systems for transport, water provision, solid waste management, and sewage removal and treatment.
不妨将这称为“安全港诅咒 ” ： 只要美国仍然是任何风暴最安全的避风港，那么它就没有动力马上修复自己的弱点。	Call this the “safe-haven curse”: as long as the US remains the safest port in any storm, it faces no immediate pressure to address its weaknesses.
现在，美国已不再背负着一位在世界各地受人讨厌的总统，普京已经失去了一个帮助他提高俄罗斯的国际地位的重要工具。	Now that America is no longer saddled with a president loathed around the world, Putin has lost one of the key tools that had helped him boost Russia’s international standing.
经济学家罗伯特·索洛（Robert Solow）就曾有一句著名的论断，说信息和通信技术革命在世界各地都是可见的 — — 除了生产力统计数字之外。	The ICT revolution was visible everywhere, the economist Robert Solow famously noted, except in the productivity statistics.
这个月在新加坡举行的东盟领导人峰会的首要议题是通过一部《宪章》来体现东南亚“同一愿景、同一身份、同一社会”的理念。	At the top of the agenda at ASEAN’s Leaders Summit in Singapore this month is the adoption of a Charter to embody its “One Vision, One identity, One Community” concept for Southeast Asia.
但是，从长远看，对各种石油工业变量的统计分析显示，不管石油是由国内还是国际石油公司所有和生产，弱势美元都通过降低石油产量来影响供应。	In the long run, however, statistical analysis of various oil industry variables indicates that a weaker dollar affects supply by reducing production, regardless of whether oil is owned and produced by national or international oil companies.
一份计划位列十项计划的第九位，另一份计划位列20项计划的第八位；签一份计划很棒，但上升空间有限；后一项计划没有那么棒，但有卓越的潜质。	One proposal might be ranked nine out of ten, while another is eight out of 20; the first is pretty good but with limited upside, while the second is not so good, but has the potential to be great.
但当然，民众怒火也是迫使德国政府在2015年对希腊采取过度严格条款，从而激起该国民粹主义反叛的原因。	But, of course, popular anger is also what forced the German government to impose overly strict terms on Greece in 2015, thus inflaming a populist revolt in that country, too.
但是，如果没有从世界人权宣言引发的合法性及其促进遵守的作用，非政府人权组织是无法发展成为全球势力的。	Yet without the legitimacy derived from the Universal Declaration and its role in promoting compliance, the nongovernmental human rights movement could not have developed into a global force.
在其它的主要经济体中，类似的担保与银行救援行为也出现过（欧洲中央银行没有发挥这种作用；国家政府在履行这种职责 ） 。	Analogous guarantees and bank bailouts have occurred in the other major economies (the ECB does not play this role for Europe; national governments do).
比如，我们不知道伊朗是否在未遭披露的地方进行秘密的活动，伊朗何时能研发出粗糙的核武器，据估计是在几个月到几年之间。	For example, we do not know whether Iran is conducting secret activities at undisclosed sites, or when Iran could develop a crude nuclear weapon, with estimates ranging from several months to several years.
虽然许多政治家都赞成对气候变化采取强力行动，但其中大多数人所认为的“强力行动”并不足以把我们带回到350ppm的大气二氧化碳含量水平。	Many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change, but what most of them regard as “strong action” will not be enough to get us back below 350 ppm.
2000年以来的住宅价格上涨更可能是源于建筑行业的供应瓶颈（无法足够迅速地满足市场的投资需要）并被（在某些地方将被）随之涌出的大量供应所抵消。	The housing-price boom of the 2000’s was little more than a construction-supply bottleneck, an inability to satisfy investment demand fast enough, and was (or in some places will be) eliminated with massive increases in supply.
让风吹吧，让风暴肆虐吧，让大雨瓢泼吧，让海平面升高吧，让空气污染杀死人吧，反正这不可能与人类温室气体排放有任何关系。	Let the winds blow, the storms rage, the rain pour, the sea levels rise, and the air pollution kill, while denying that it could possibly have any relationship to humans greenhouse-gas emissions.
更广泛地说，如新的青少年健康和福利柳叶刀委员会（Lancet Commission on Adolescent Health and Wellbeing）所强调的，全球健康和社会政策几乎完全忽略了青少年健康。	More broadly, as the new Lancet Commission on Adolescent Health and Wellbeing highlights, global health and social policy largely tends to ignore adolescent health.
如果失业率能以一个更为决定性和持续性的方式下降的话，美国经济当然有能力 去达到国家所需的“逃逸速度 ” 。	The US economy is certainly capable of reaching the “escape velocity” that the country needs if unemployment is to fall in a more definitive and lasting manner.
即便批评者们说该运动的唯一成就就是让消费者们对自己感觉良好 — — 就像从前在天主教堂购买赎罪券那样，但这其实是低估了公平贸易。	While cynics say that its only achievement is to make consumers feel better about their purchases – rather like buying indulgences in the old Catholic Church – this is to sell fair trade short.
而中国当局目前正在削减中国增长的另一主要推进器 — — 公共部门投资的规模，因为低回报项目所形成的总需求很快就会变得不可持续。	And the Chinese authorities are now scaling back the other major driver of their country’s growth, public-sector investment, as low-return projects seem to generate aggregate demand but prove unsustainable fairly quickly.
The Kyoto approach allocated emission rights, which are a valuable asset.	The Kyoto approach allocated emission rights, which are a valuable asset.
美国每年给埃及13亿美元军事援助（仅次于给以色列的数字 ） ， 但民用项目和计划的援助只有2.5亿美元。	The US gives Egypt $1.3 billion in annual military aid (second only to Israel), but just $250 million for civilian projects and programs.
如今，经济增长已经慢了下来 — — 官方年增长率数据为7 % ， 但大部分观察者认为接近5 % （ 甚至更低 ） — —中国的治理问题也变得不容忽视。	Now that economic growth is flagging – official statistics put the annual rate at 7%, but most observers believe the real number is closer to 5% (or even lower) – China’s governance problems are becoming impossible to ignore.
这样的亲欧盟联盟为欧盟赢得了体制改革的时间，令欧盟得以推行共同的外交政策并启动以投资和创新为主导的绿色经济增长，从而代替自满和紧缩。	Such pro-EU alignments give the EU time to reform its institutions, stake out a common foreign policy, and initiate investment- and innovation-led green growth in place of austerity and complacency.
由于无法继续升读乌克兰的大学，这些学生别无选择，只能去匈牙利找一些只需中学文凭的工作或者移居匈牙利。	Unable to attend a Ukrainian university, these students have little choice but to find local work in Hungarian that requires only a secondary-school education, or move to Hungary.
当中央银行负责保证系统中有充足流动性的时候，所谓“微观谨慎”的 金融监管应当独立监督金融机构的稳健性并对存款人进行保护。	While central banks should be in charge of maintaining adequate levels of liquidity in the system, so-called “microprudential” financial regulation should independently oversee financial institutions’ soundness and the protection of depositors.
（事实上，若作为主权国家，加州和得州分别是2012年世界第12大和第14大经济体，位于荷兰、墨西哥和韩国之前。 ）	(In fact, as sovereign countries, California and Texas would have been the world’s 12th and 14th largest economies, respectively, in 2012 – ahead of the Netherlands, Mexico, and South Korea.)
如今，瓦鲁法基斯已退出希腊政府，而这三个问题依然十分重要，一点都不亚于他在拜访欧洲各国和紧张的布鲁塞尔谈判最后关头的时候。	These issues remain as relevant today, with Varoufakis out of government, as they were when he was tirelessly advocating for them during visits to European capitals and in tense late-night negotiations in Brussels.
在2015年纽约举行的联合国可持续发展高峰会议上，中国承诺出资20亿美元协助实施可持续发展议程，而作为中国发展援助旗舰的一带一路计划在拟议战略中纳入了卫生领域的合作。	At the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York, China pledged $2 billion to help implement the SDG agenda, and China’s flagship “Belt and Road Initiative” includes health cooperation as part of its proposed strategy.
最新措施 — — 对欧洲央行主要再融资操作实施零利率、月度资产购买量从600亿欧元增加到800亿欧元，以及进一步将存款利率下调到-0.4 % — —也无法改变局面。	The latest measures – a zero interest rate on the ECB’s main refinancing operations, an increase in monthly asset purchases from €60 billion ($67 billion) to €80 billion, and an even lower deposit rate of -0.40% – are unlikely to change this.
示范课程不必局限于教授黄金法则或乐观看待普世宗教公理的影响力，还应当支持向学生讲授多样化力量对社会有利的课程。	A model curriculum need not be limited to teaching the Golden Rule or making optimistic appeals to universal religious axioms. It should also support courses that teach pupils that diversity is a strength and a public good for their societies.
有人的反应是参与骚乱；有人支持极右翼的排外政党；而更多人则默默压抑着怒火，对政治家及其所代表制度不满的情绪越来越强。	Some have reacted by rioting; others have backed far-right xenophobic political parties; many more seethe quietly, growing ever more resentful of politicians and the system they represent.
因此可以归纳出宏观经济政策的第一条原则：因为只有政府才能生产出萧条中紧缺的投资级别金融资产，所以它必须承担这一责任。	Thus, the first principle of macroeconomic policy is that because only the government can create the investment-grade financial assets that are in short supply in a depression, it is the government’s task to do so.
端坐在电视镜头前的人与工厂、办公室、酒吧、教堂、学校和医院距离太远，而那些地方才是观众形成决定他们如何处理信息的关系的地方。	Men and women talking in front of TV cameras are too far removed from the factories, offices, bars, churches, schools, and hospitals where viewers form the relationships that determine how they process information.
结果，减贫方案常常间接假定只要提高物质财富、改善生活条件，就能自动带来包括精神福利改善在内的无形收益。	As a result, solutions to poverty often implicitly assume that more material wealth or improved living conditions will automatically translate into non-tangible benefits, including improved mental wellbeing.
在最近的历史上，不同的区域性强国—沙(Shah, 伊朗国王的称号—译者注)的伊朗和纳塞尔的埃及—曾经在中东崛起。	In recent history, a variety of regional powers – the Shah’s Iran and Nasser’s Egypt – have arisen in the Middle East.
第四种解释是，儿童时期智力较高的人通常会获得较好的教育，从事更多的专业工作，具有更高的收入，而且居住在更富有的区域。	A fourth type of explanation is that people with higher intelligence in childhood tend to attain better educational qualifications, work in more professional jobs, have higher incomes, and live in more affluent areas.
即使仅仅是核打击威胁也有可能引发动荡，前提是上述威胁促使韩国和日本等美国相关盟国增加他们的军事开支并重新思考他们不拥核的立场。	Even just the threat of such a strike could be destabilizing, if it drives concerned US allies such as South Korea and Japan to increase their military spending and reconsider their non-nuclear postures.
导致欧盟国际地位和声誉下滑的原因很多，其中一个原因就是欧盟正逐渐退化成一座偏远而又官僚气息浓厚的孤城。	There are many causes for the decline of the EU’s global position and prestige, one of which has been the way in which the Union has evolved as an aloof and bureaucratic citadel.
尽管鲁哈尼在这一问题上无法一言九鼎，但他必须直面这一问题，如果他的计划是实现伊朗国际关系的真正改善的话。	Though Rowhani will not have sole decision-making power on this issue, he will have to face it squarely if his plan is truly to recalibrate Iran’s international relations.
因此他协助创建了农业信贷协会 — — 最初是以客户的身份，后来逐渐成为顾问和董事，这是一套国家银行合作网络，其目的是帮助当地农民度过尘暴天气。	So he helped guide – first as a customer, and later as an adviser and director – Farm Credit, a national banking cooperative network, in its efforts to help local farmers weather the Dust Bowl years.
这创造了全世界执政者和被执政者之间最大的年龄差，并引起了人们对决策者能否理解年轻人期望和需求的担心。	That is the world’s largest age gap between governors and the governed, and it raises concerns about how well decision-makers understand the needs and aspirations of young people.
命令和控制性的贷款资助（也被经济学家称为“指令性贷款 ” ） 在修建桥梁的时候还可以奏效。 但是在选择哪些公司值得存活的时候，它就相形见绌了。	Command and control financing (“directed lending,” as economists call it) works well when it comes to building bridges; it is a lot less effective when it comes to choosing what companies deserve to survive.
相比之下，由太阳活动所导致的地球能源总量变化幅度只有上述原因的1/10，而且起的还是反作用：近几年的太阳是1970年代开始卫星观测以来光线最为黯淡的。	The changes in the planet’s energy budget caused by solar variations are at least ten times smaller in comparison. And they go in the wrong direction: in recent years, the sun has been at its dimmest since satellite measurements began in the 1970’s.
特拉维夫—以色列和阿拉伯领导人多年来一直在警告伊朗领导的什叶派帝国的崛起。 这个帝国覆盖了中东大部。	TEL AVIV – Israeli and Arab leaders have spent years warning of the rise of an Iranian-led Shia empire covering much of the Middle East.
总统对司法部长杰夫·塞申斯（Jeff Sessions）也仍然非常愤怒，作为自2016年竞选早期阶段特朗普仅有的参议院支持者，塞申斯主动申请回避调查。	The president remains furious that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was Trump’s sole Senate backer from early in the 2016 campaign, has recused himself from the investigation.
激励的减少 — — 以及市场通过价格信号传递激励信息的能力的下降 — — 无异于收走增长引擎中的燃料。	Whittle away at incentives – and at the market’s ability to communicate them through price signals – and you starve the growth engine of its fuel.
纽约大学麦伦研究所（Marron Institute）的马可·克莱曼（Mark Kleiman）指出，共和党僵化而死硬地在思想上反对“向富人征税[已经]在实际层面破坏了相信自由贸易让所有人都能获利的理论基础 ” 。	As Mark Kleiman of NYU’s Marron Institute points out, the Republican Party’s rigid and die-hard ideological opposition to “taxing the rich [has] destroyed, on a practical level, the theoretical basis for believing that free trade benefits everyone.”
与此同时，美国与巴基斯坦的战略合作关系（在这方面，奥巴马除掉了本·拉登，赢得了重要的象征性胜利）也是千疮百孔。	Meanwhile, America’s strategic partnership with Pakistan, where Obama won a significant symbolic victory by eliminating Osama bin Laden, is in tatters.
从加纳到卢旺达，高农业投资水平正在推动农业地区令人印象深刻的经济增长，从而增加了就业、减少了贫困和饥饿。	From Ghana to Rwanda, high levels of agricultural investment are fueling impressive economic growth in rural areas, thereby boosting job creation and reducing poverty and hunger.
接着，为了捍卫堕胎合法化，她就像奥逊·威尔斯（Orson Welles）的《审判 》 （ The Trial）中的角色罗米·施耐德（Romy Schneider ） ， 坚定而局促不安。	Then, defending the legalization of abortion, she resembled Romy Schneider in Orson Welles’s The Trial, determined but ill at ease.
本月，副总统彭斯猛烈指责中国在美国“利用政治、经济和军事工具以及宣传手段提高影响力、满足其利益 ” 。	And, just this month, Vice President Mike Pence bluntly accused China of “using political, economic, and military tools, as well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests” in the US.
结果，紧缩横行，只有法国的马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）和意大利的毕普·格里洛（Beppe Grillo）等民粹主义者提出异议，而他们的经济方案更加不可能见效。	As a result, austerity reigns, and dissent is left to populists like France’s Marine Le Pen or Italy’s Beppe Grillo – whose economic proposals seem even less likely to be effective.
20世纪90年代初的市场改革改变了这一模式，在国大党的领导下，年增长率加速至7 % ， 随后滑落到5 % 。	Market-oriented reforms in the early 1990s changed that pattern, and annual growth accelerated to 7% under the Congress party, before slumping to 5%.
候选人 — — 特别是欧洲社会党（Party of European Socialists）领袖马丁·舒尔茨（Martin Schultz ） — —的竞选活动也超越了国界。	The candidates, particularly Martin Schulz, the leader of the Party of European Socialists, campaigned beyond their national borders.
货币操纵在近几年中可谓声名狼藉 — — 也给美国相关行业和社区造成了不利影响 — — 当选代表不可能对此视而不见。	Currency manipulation has become a little too ugly in recent years – with associated adverse effects on sectors and communities in the US – for elected representatives to ignore.
阿根廷汽车使用压缩天然气为燃料的比例世界最高；家庭也大量使用天然气；大部分电力由天然气提供；石化行业也建立在天然气的基础上。	Argentina has the world’s largest fleet of vehicles running on compressed natural gas; families use gas intensively; most electricity is generated with gas; and the petrochemical industry is based on it.
在英国，英格兰银行附属的金融政策委员会（Financial Policy Committee）负责监控金融业失灵的“系统风险 ” ， 审慎监管局（Prudential Regulatory Authority）负责监管具有系统重要性的机构。	In the UK, a Financial Policy Committee within the Bank of England is to monitor the “systemic risk” of financial failure, with a Prudential Regulatory Authority supervising systemically important institutions.
更令事态恶化的是，在反对派在2008年12月重夺大权后，这些攻击之词的始作俑者竟然在军方支持的总理阿披实·维乍集瓦内阁当上了外交部长。	Exacerbating matters, the PAD progenitor of that insult became Thailand’s foreign minister after Thaksin’s opponents regained power in December 2008, led by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and reinforced by the army.
他认为我们对泡沫的认知跟通货膨胀一样多，同时应该明确认定央行调整利率的理由不能仅限于短期控制消费价格走势等目标。	We know as much about bubbles as we do about inflation, Caruana argues, and central banks’ need to move interest rates for reasons other than the short-term control of consumer-price trends should be explicitly recognized.
现在已经弄清楚了的是，是一系列复杂的关系、相互影响、事件以及众多不同市场参与者的疏忽，而不是某个单一因素，应该对经济危机负责。	What is clear is that a complex set of relationships, interactions, events, and omissions on the part of many different actors, rather than any single factor, was to blame.
只要足够大比例的艾滋病毒阳性个体接受ARV疗法，就不但可以拯救他们的生命，还能打破病毒本身的传播链，从而消灭这一传染病。	If a high enough proportion of HIV-positive individuals receive ARV treatment, it is possible not only to save their lives, but also to break the transmission of the virus itself, thereby ending the epidemic.
德国和日本说他们想在联合国安理会获得常任理事国的席位，但他们都没有坚持承诺去帮助世界上最贫穷的人们。	Germany and Japan say that they want a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, but neither has yet followed through on its own pledges to help the world's poorest people.
欧盟同时应该在下一个伙伴和合作协议谈判中商定一个框架文件以明确能源宪章条约，尤其是越境转运议定书中所包含的义务。	The EU should also negotiate a framework document in the context of the next Partnership and Cooperation Agreement negotiations in order to clarify the obligations contained in the Treaty, in particular its Transit Protocol.
就像《圣经》里彼得和约翰对一个乞丐说 ， “ 站起来向前走 ， ” 非洲人被呼唤着远离无知、惰性、冷漠和宿命。	As in the Bible story, when Peter and John said to a beggar, “rise up and walk,” Africans are called upon to walk away from ignorance, inertia, apathy, and fatalism.
不幸的是，即将做出承诺的有效性 — — 尤其是在索马里、尼日利亚北部和伊拉克安巴尔省等惨遭蹂躏的土地上 — — 完全是不确定的。	Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the pledges that will be made – particularly in ravaged lands like Somalia, northern Nigeria, and Iraq’s Anbar province – is entirely uncertain.
这两位新上任的官员都将在准备特朗普与金正恩即将召开的峰会期间开始新的工作 — — 这也是特朗普再次突然单方面决定的结果。	Both are expected to start their new jobs in the run-up to Trump’s expected summit with Kim Jong-un – the product of yet another abrupt unilateral decision by Trump.
它们可以从贷款人手中购买不良贷款，并免除部分可偿还本金，同时降低贷款人的抵押品要求和借款人的债务积压。	They could buy bad loans from lenders and forgive part of the principal payable by borrowers, simultaneously reducing lenders’ collateral requirements and borrowers’ debt overhang.
而事实上，近二十年前我领导以色列谈判团队时，双方都接受了将耶路撒冷根据种族边界一分为二的方案（尽管这一边界具有一定灵活性 ） 。	And, in fact, when I led the Israeli negotiating team almost two decades ago, both sides accepted the idea of Jerusalem being partitioned, albeit with flexible borders, along ethnic lines.
欧盟从中扮演了一个协调人的角色：我们敦促双方领导人及时把握住这个机会，并着眼于通往欧洲大家庭的国家未来，更何况他们自古就是这个家庭的其中一员。	The EU has offered to play a facilitating role: we urge both leaderships to promptly seize this opportunity, with a view to their states’ further steps along the path towards the European family to which all Balkan countries naturally belong.
如果这种情况真的发生的话，就会出现一个无任何党派占明显多数的议会，一个由少数派执政的一个政府，称为“第三阵线 ” ， 有可能得到某个大党口头上的支持。	In that case, a “hung parliament” could see a “third front” coming to power as a minority government, supported tactically by one of the big parties.
在通常是遭受残酷折磨之后才被杀死的几千人中，许多人，如果不是大多数人的话，是毒品卡特尔的成员以及他们的家人。	Of the thousands who have been killed, often after being horribly tortured, many, if not most, have been members of the drug cartels and their families.
过去几年的一个显而易见的痛苦事实是，劳动力市场的长期不振意味着大部分工人实际工资的下降，工人在工资分布中的地位下移，由此进一步加剧了消极影响。	As has been painfully obvious during the last several years, prolonged labor-market slack means falling real wages for most workers, with the negative effect intensifying as one moves down the wage distribution.
非法监禁、绑架、失踪、虐待、强奸和非人道关押自从20世纪80年代以来便不绝于人权组织和少数埃及法庭记录中。	Unlawful detentions, kidnappings, disappearances, systematic torture, rape, and inhuman prison conditions have all been documented since the 1980’s by human-rights organizations and a few Egyptian courts.
20世纪90年代末尤其如此，当时的中国领导人在第一线目睹了储备���尽和相关货币的崩溃是如何席卷看似坚不可摧的经济体的。	That is especially the case concerning the experience of the late 1990s, when Chinese leaders saw firsthand how a run on reserves and a related currency collapse can wreak havoc on seemingly invincible economies.
我们需要成立统一的边防部队和欧洲庇护办公室，每个国家都将在欧洲内部安全委员会的管理下，严格执行控制义务并致力于欧洲团结进程。	We will need a common border force and a European asylum office, strict control obligations and European solidarity to which each country will contribute under the authority of a European Council for Internal Security.
这将让低碳能源体系转型获得全球规模的融资，并且融资方式能通过投资致力于绿色能源和可持续技术的研发来稳定全球经济。	This would enable the transition to a low-carbon energy system to be financed on a global scale and in a manner that stabilizes the global economy through investments in research and development dedicated to green energy and sustainable technologies.
在过去十几年间，韩国一直是朝鲜最主要的外部食品供应者，要么直接援助粮食（针对某些紧急情况 ） ， 要么输送化肥。	In past years, South Korea has been the primary external source of food, through either direct food assistance (for the immediate problem) or deliveries of fertilizer.
在这个被针对移民、银行家、穆斯林 、 “ 自由派精英 ” 、 “欧盟官员 ” 、 世界主义者或哪怕仅有些许陌生的任何事物的不满所占据的世界里，像这样明智的看法已经十分罕有。	In a world increasingly dominated by grievances – against immigrants, bankers, Muslims, “liberal elites,” “Eurocrats,” cosmopolitans, or anything else that seems vaguely alien – such wise words are rare.
各种用首字母缩写命名的机构、智库、任务组等都认为，自动化和人工智能很快就会消除或改变为数庞大但难以估量的人类就业岗位。	According to acronymically named institutions, think tanks, task forces, et hoc genus omne, automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will soon eliminate or alter a large but unpredictable number of human jobs.
一些同源体的结构比另一些更“松 ” （ 即包装更简单）它们表面区域能被水侵蚀，水可以轻易地与蛋白质主干链产生互动，从而破坏其结构。	The structure in some seems “looser” than in others – less well packed, with surface regions that enable surrounding water to penetrate and disrupt the structure by interacting favorably with the protein backbone.
东扩的进程或者将被推迟，或者将彻底陷入停滞，原因是欧盟无法继续按照《尼斯条约》的规定吸收新加盟的成员。	The process of enlargement will either be delayed or stopped completely, because the EU can no longer admit new members on the basis of the “Nice constitution.”
其二，伊朗人深知俄罗斯和中国都绝对不会允许其拥有核武器，一旦伊朗核武化，那么这两大强权也不会再在联合国安理会上维护伊朗。	Second, it is well understood that there is zero tolerance in Russia and China for an Iranian bomb, and all the rope that that these powers have so far given Iran in the Security Council will run out if Iran weaponizes.
理论上，借以时日，可能产生一个更具代表性的国家政府，尽管不论在何种情形下，要在18个月内举行选举都只是幻想。	In principle, and over time, a more representative national government could come about, although talk of holding elections in 18 months is fanciful under any scenario.
按照这种观点，所有用来补充的细胞按照功能在结构上被组合在一起并形成主要的路径，组成大脑的“硬件 ” 。	In this view, the total complement of cells, anatomically organized by function and forming major pathways, constituted the brain’s “hardware.”
问题列表继续将焦点放在能够解决粮食生产和解决饥荒的农业技术以及增加洁净饮用水的供给和改善公共卫生的技术上。	The list goes on to focus on agricultural technologies to tackle food production and hunger, as well as technologies to boost the supply of clean drinking water and improve sanitation.
只要强化政治意愿和明智投资，完成可持续发展目标为子孙后代减少贫困和保护野生动物的双重任务是完全可能的。	With more political will and smart investments, there is no reason we can’t reach the SDGs to both reduce poverty and safeguard wildlife for future generations.
同时，他们也会削弱自身的国际影响力，使其他势力在欧美的争斗中渔翁得利，还会断送通过改革后的美国重建西方社会的最后机会。	At the same time, they will undermine their own international influence, allow others to play off Europe against America, destroying as well what chance remains for rebuilding the West with a reformed America.
像弗拉基米尔·普京在最近和国有俄罗斯外贸银行（VTB）的首席执行官的会议中谈及的那样 ， “ 或许我们应该〔在国外〕买一些东西？	As Prime Minister Vladimir Putin remarked at a recent meeting with the CEO of state-owned bank VTB, “Perhaps we should buy something [abroad]?
从长期来看，我们需要研究一些新的技术，例如碳捕获及存储技术（CCS ） ， 加大核���的开发，以及对太阳能的进一步利用等。 目前和未来科技的发展将会给我们带来什么成果，目前还不可预知。	In the longer term, we also need technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), expanded nuclear power, and new generations of solar energy, together with the development of technologies whose potential or even existence is still unknown.
大城市房价飞涨首先始于1996年的伦敦，繁荣心理随后在1997年迅速传到了洛杉矶、纽约和悉尼，1998年传到巴黎，2001年传到迈阿密、莫斯科和上海，2002年又轮到了温哥华。	The first big city to boom was London, starting around 1996. Boom mentality spread to Los Angeles, New York, and Sydney around 1997, to Paris in 1998, to Miami, Moscow, and Shanghai in 2001, and Vancouver around 2002.
美国致力于重启以巴和谈的进程，但伊朗固守30年以来的政策，坚决反对任何促进该区域和平的努力，并对美国造成了极大阻力。	American efforts to re-start Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have faced adamant opposition from Iran, which maintains its 30-year-old policy of opposing any effort to promote peace in the region.
它不像酸雨或者灰霾那样是一个“常规环境问题 ” ， 而更像一个能源问题，经济发展问题以及土地使用问题。	Unlike, say, acid rain or smog, it is not “a conventional environmental ‘problem.’” It is as much “an energy problem, an economic development problem, or a land-use problem.”
实际上，特别是在欧洲，极右势力和伊斯兰激进主义之间的关系根深蒂固，这两个群体的追随者拥有某些共同的重要特质。	In fact, the relationship between the extreme right, particularly in Europe, and Islamist radicalism runs deep, with adherents of both groups sharing some important traits.
根据这一观点，欧洲一体化从一开始（60多年前）就是有缺陷的，因为它最先是作为一项精英工程为人所知和发展的。	According to this view, European integration was flawed from the outset, more than six decades ago, because it was conceived and developed as an elite project.
比如 ， （ RED）工程是一项旨在为全球艾滋病、结核病和疟疾斗争基金筹资的项目，它将出售打有项目标识的消费品，将收入的一部分用于该基金。	For example, the project (RED) is a corporate campaign that aims to raise money for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria by donating a portion of proceeds from consumer products branded with the cause.
与往往造成赢家通吃局面的市场主导需求不同，政府资助需求营造出技术问题多重解决方案并存及共同发展的环境。	Unlike market-driven demand, which too often results in a winner-takes-all dynamic, state-sponsored demand creates an environment in which multiple solutions to technical problems can proliferate and coexist.
就像西班牙不是加泰罗尼亚的占领国一样，西方并不将试图阻止库尔德独立的土耳其、伊拉克、叙利亚和伊朗视为真正的殖民国家。	Just as Spain is not an occupying power in Catalonia, the West does not regard the countries seeking to prevent Kurdish independence – Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran – as true colonial powers.
半岛电视台的记者是家喻户晓的名人，他们需要比其他重要新闻机构的同行忍受更多的骚扰、监禁，甚至付出生命的代价。	Al Jazeera journalists are household names; they also suffer more harassment, imprisonment, and fatalities than their colleagues at other major news organizations.
但《柳叶刀》杂志的一篇2017年的研究发现，在结核病较为普遍的国家 ， “ 家庭联系调查仍然严重欠缺 。 ”	A 2017 study in The Lancet, however, finds that “household contact investigation remains severely underutilized” in countries where TB is common.
在其他国家 — — 首推巴西 — — 左倾政府以不稳定的强力方式推进产业升级，以至于最终结果是意在推进的部门反而遭到了削弱。	In others – Brazil comes to mind – left-leaning governments practiced industrial promotion in such a heavy-handed and erratic way that they ended up weakening whatever it was they wanted to promote.
某些研究课题所牵涉的利益和潜在的回报极为巨大，这也就是为什么最近披露韩国科学家黄禹锡炮制他的干细胞研究结果造成了巨大的反响。	The stakes and potential rewards for a few research topics are exceptionally high, which is why the recent finding that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk fabricated the results of his work on stem cells has reverberated so widely.
边境争端仍然没有得到解决，定期的有中国的军队侵入印度的领土，此外还有新的导致两国关系紧张的因素，例如在印度被给予庇护的西藏流亡者反对中国的抗议。	The border dispute remains unresolved, with periodic incursions by Chinese troops onto Indian soil and new irritants such as the anti-Chinese protests by Tibetan exiles who have been given asylum in India.
自我封闭不参与全球经济让巴西失去了急需的动力，给巴西家庭造成了严重后果，近几年中，巴西家庭收入增长十分低迷。	Sealing itself off from the bracing effects of global competition is sapping Brazil of much-needed momentum, with serious consequences for households, most of which have experienced only modest income growth in recent years.
美国知识分子没能挑战这些思想 — — 并帮助美国人民抵制产生自无知的自大态度 — — 这让溺爱公众的文化永久化了。	American intellectuals’ failure to challenge these ideas – and to help the US population shed complacent attitudes based on ignorance – perpetuates a culture of coddling the public.
与痛恨或破坏半岛电视台相反，如果政治家们意识到阿拉伯民主之路是一个十分棘手的过程，那么他们理应鼓励这块言论自由的阵地。	But instead of bashing or seeking to undermine Al Jazeera, politicians should encourage this bastion of free expression, recognizing that Arabs will need to endure a messy process on the way to democracy.
大企业和小企业可以造成各种各样的外部性，而这些外部性必须冷静仔细地予以考察 — — 这也正是斯坦的建议。	Big and small firms can create a wide variety of externalities, and these have to be examined carefully and dispassionately – exactly as Stein is recommending.
随着关于合约和资源分配腐败横行的证据浮出水面，政府部长、官僚和企业高管纷纷被捕，一些人被判处长期徒刑。	As evidence emerged of widespread corruption in contracts and resource allocation, ministers, bureaucrats, and high-level corporate officers were arrested, and some have spent long periods in jail.
但如果共和党外交机构真想了解像特朗普这样的候选人来源于何处，那么老大党的党员应当好好审视一下队伍中某些人的言行。	And yet, if the GOP foreign-policy establishment wants to understand where a candidate like Trump came from, its members would do well to look at the behavior of some within their own ranks.
如果研究表明，至少在某些情况下先进发达国家的政策不符合发展中国家的利益，那么你是否对这些研究持开明态度？	Will you be open to research even when that research shows that policies of the advanced industrial countries may, at least in some circumstances, not be in the interests of developing countries?
但大量证据表明，对欧洲来说，真正的竞争挑战将来自东方特别是中国。 中国正在采取保护主义和扩张主义方针确保其未来数字主宰力。	But there is mounting evidence that the real competitive challenge for Europe will come from the East, especially China, which is taking a protectionist and expansionist approach to securing its future digital dominance.
就像特朗普许多种族主义及其他煽动性言论（更不要说行动）一样，这样的言论显然不符合英国领导人的形象要求。	Such statements are clearly not befitting of a British political leader, much like many of the racially charged and otherwise incendiary comments (not to mention actions) that Trump has made.
我来这里是考察OCP集团项目的可持续性。 OCP集团是全球领先的磷酸盐生产商，开采着全球大约70%的磷酸盐储备，我是其国际顾问委员会成员。	OCP Group is a leading phosphate producer, with access to approximately 70% of the world’s phosphate reserves.
但是，尽管非洲可以被认为是希望之洲，它却不可能成为“新亚洲 ” ， 即全球增长的长期发动机，这是文化、政治、地缘政治也许还有心理因素共同作用的结果。	But, though Africa can be described as the continent of hope, it is unlikely to become the “New Asia” – that is, a long-term dynamo of global growth – for a combination of cultural, political, geopolitical, and perhaps psychological reasons.
在每个项目中专家们都撰写了数十篇研究报告，研究从武装冲突，生物多样性破坏，到传染病和卫生设施的各种问题上投入资源的最佳方式。	In each of these projects, experts wrote dozens of research papers examining how best to spend resources on a variety of issues, from armed conflict and biodiversity destruction to infectious disease and sanitation.
想一想莫斯科，这是一个很老练的模仿者（尽管比不上圣彼得堡那个涅瓦河畔模仿意大利的巴洛克风格城市 ） 。	Consider Moscow, a highly seasoned imitator (though nowhere in the league of St. Petersburg, that baroque Italianate city on the Neva, as an urban mimic).
美国的量化宽松不可能全球经常项目平衡如此大规模波动的原因，因为在近几年中美国的对外赤字并没有发生大变化。	Quantitative easing in the US cannot have been behind these large swings in global current-account balances, because America’s external deficit has not changed significantly in recent years.
因此，国际媒体协助中心（Center for International Media Assistance）刚刚发布的一份新报告重点阐述了这一现象 — — 并呼吁采取办法解决这个问题。	That is why the Center for International Media Assistance has just released a new report shining a spotlight on the phenomenon – and calling for solutions.
英国于1973年加入欧盟的前身欧洲经济共同体，此前它在1963年和1967年两次申请加入，但都被法国总统戴高乐否决。	The UK joined the European Economic Community, the predecessor to the EU, in 1973, on its third attempt, after French President Charles de Gaulle vetoed its applications in 1963 and 1967.
而巴勒斯坦人也会将任何可能得到以色列同意的难民问题方案视为对其民族主义精神（即所谓家园回归权）的背叛。	And Palestinians would view any solution to the refugee problem that Israel might accept as a betrayal of the ethos of Palestinian nationalism, namely the Right of Return.
对高收入人群收取更多的所得税可以产生收入，用来资助所需的公共投资，同样也为那些包括失业人口在内的底层人民提供一些社会保障。	Higher taxes at the top could generate revenues to finance needed public investment, and to provide some social protection for those at the bottom, including the unemployed.
尽管精心构思新贸易协定的前景不乐观，但信息革命仍然加强了全球供应链，并且，与20世纪30年代（甚至80年代）不同，保护主义也没有回潮的趋势。	While the prospects for elaborate new trade agreements have suffered, the information revolution has strengthened global supply chains and, unlike in the 1930s (or even the 1980s), there has not been a reversion to protectionism.
接着欧盟理事会主席安吉拉·默克尔把它称为一个“突破 ” ， 欧洲委员会主席若泽·曼努埃尔·巴罗佐宣布它是“历史上最有雄心的一揽子计划 ” 。	Then EU Council President Angela Merkel called it “a breakthrough,” and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso proclaimed it “the most ambitious package ever.”
这一安排给了多国央行 — — 特别是欧洲的央行，由于美国投资者的逃离，它们面临着美元短缺 — — 所需要的美元贷给苦苦挣扎的国内金融机构。	This gave central banks – especially those in Europe, which faced a dollar shortage as US investors fled – the dollars they needed to lend to struggling domestic financial institutions.
两项最近的两党法案 — — 众议长保罗·瑞恩（Paul Ryan）和其他人似乎对这两个法案持支持态度 — — 将这些改革和联邦基础设施资金直接挂钩。	Two recent bipartisan bills – which seem to have the support of Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, among others – link such reforms directly to federal infrastructure funding.
孟买、内罗毕和金沙萨等特大城市其实是处在巨型贫民窟包围中的小城镇 — — 就像一片绝望海洋中的财富绿洲。	Megacities like Mumbai, Nairobi, and Kinshasa are essentially small cities surrounded by huge slums – pockets of wealth in a sea of despair.
尽管主权财富基金国际工作组的最新报告表明，使用统一治理标准尚有诸多困难有待克服，但我们仍然需要一些措施，把利比亚重新纳入全球资本市场。	Although recent reports of the International Working Group of sovereign funds have indicated the difficulties in applying uniform governance standards, several measures are needed in order to bring Libya back to global capital markets.
我们显然用了耕地、牧场、森林和渔场来生产食品、纤维和木材，而且我们还需要空间来造房、修路和建设城市。	We obviously use cropland, grazing land, forests, and fishing grounds to produce our food, fiber, and timber, and we need space for our houses, roads, and cities.
德意志银行丑闻让人们得以一瞥有望拯救欧洲工程的最后选择 — — 类似于美式橄榄球中的“万福玛丽亚传球 ” 。	What the Deutsche Bank scandal has done is shine a light on a last-resort option – a kind of “Hail Mary pass,” in American football terms – that could potentially save the European project.
我是一个社会民主派人士，我相信，如果说公民极为重视某一种经��服务或者利益而且只有各国政府才能够提供的话，那么，政府就应责无旁贷地予以提供。	I am enough of a social democrat to believe that if there is an economic service or benefit that citizens value extremely highly and that only the government can provide, then the government should provide it.
为了打消韩朝之间深刻的互相怀疑，我们将致力于强化韩朝内部对话，慎重地考虑各个问题，同时兑现已经达成一致的承诺。	To chip away at the deep-rooted suspicion between the two Koreas, we will work to strengthen inter-Korean dialogue and discuss matters prudentially while keeping promises on what is agreed.
美国领导的联军临时权力机构授权的新一批政治精英根本不信任彼此，更重要的是，他们未能就治理国家的共同目标达成妥协。	The United States-led Coalition Provisional Authority empowered a new group of political elites who fundamentally distrusted one another and, more important, failed to coalesce around a shared vision for governing the country.
斯沃斯莫尔—如今，在美国和其他国家，民粹主义政客常常声称宽松的货币政策正在伤害普通工人，从而加剧收入不平等。	SWARTHMORE – In the United States and elsewhere nowadays, populist politicians often claim that easy monetary policy is hurting ordinary workers, thereby exacerbating income inequality.
例如最近由智库机构欧洲贸易研究组（European Trade Study Group）研究员法兰切斯科·埃罗（Francesco Aiello ） ， 格兹埃拉·布南诺（Graziella Bonanno）和阿列西亚·维阿（Alessia Via）共同发表的一篇论文就显示“长期出口水平似乎与英国的实际汇率无关 ” 。	For example, a recent paper by Francesco Aiello, Graziella Bonanno, and Alessia Via of the European Trade Study Group finds that “the long-run level of exports appears to be unrelated to the real exchange rate for the UK.”
有一点可以肯定，那就是1989年以来把持波兰政局的共产主义者和后共产主义者已经被人们彻底地抛弃¾左翼党派在议会投票中只赢得了11%的选票。	To be sure, the communists-cum-postcommunists who have dominated Polish politics since 1989 were utterly repudiated – the left got scarcely 11% of the vote in the parliamentary poll.

俄罗斯总统普京甚至警告说，没有俄罗斯核威慑的制衡，美国将对更多国家进行军事干预，一如前南斯拉夫、伊拉克和利比亚的成例。	Russian President Vladimir Putin has even warned that, left unchallenged by Russia’s nuclear deterrent, the US would be tempted to intervene militarily in more countries, as it did in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Libya.
在欧元区，形形色色的政府你方唱罢我登场，一直在威胁实施德国政府所要求、欧盟委员会所采取的漏洞百出又不公平的政策。	In the eurozone, successive governments of all stripes have been bullied into implementing flawed and unjust policies demanded by Germany’s government and imposed by the European Commission.
桑德斯阵营主张美国所能筹集的数额将是英国在其较窄的交易税上所筹集数额的五倍多 — — 相当于个人所得税收入的10%以上。	The claim is that the US can collect more than five times the amount the UK collects on its narrow tax – an amount equal to more than 10% of revenue from personal income tax.
注资人不应该通过不可靠、资金不足的年度人道主义呼吁提供援助，而应该提供可预测的多年期融资，如英国所做的那样。	Instead of delivering aid through unreliable, underfunded annual humanitarian appeals, donors need to provide predictable multi-year funding, as the United Kingdom has done.
1991年，石油价格暴跌45 % ， 2003年则下跌了35 % ， 都是在美国发动袭击不出一个月发生。	Oil prices plunged by 45% in1991, and by 35% in 2003, within a month of the US launching its attacks.
人们担忧的主要原因是美国的收入不平等已经回到了镀金时代的极端状况；但是在世界其他国家不平等现象愈演愈烈的同时，拉美的不平等依然没有缓和的迹象。	A major reason is concern in the United States that income inequality has returned to Gilded Age extremes; but inequality has increased in many other parts of the world as well, and remains high in Latin America.
剑桥 — — 1831年，当查尔斯·达尔文登上贝格尔号开始其为期五年的探险之旅时，船只的航行还离不开能够显示参考位置准确时间的经线仪的帮助。	CAMBRIDGE – In 1831, when Charles Darwin boarded The Beagle for its five-year voyage of exploration, ships navigated with the help of chronometers, which showed the precise time at a reference location.
他们还选择了新的写作主题：Tripathi挖掘古神话题材，写出了关于湿婆神的三部曲；Bhagat开始写印度年青一代、向上奋斗的中产阶级的生活。	They also chose new themes: Tripathi dipped into ancient mythology to write a trilogy about the god Shiva, while Bhagat began to write about the lives of India’s young, upwardly mobile middle class.
大部分人都能走路、操纵物体、在幼儿期就能理解复杂的语言，从来不必关注完成这些任务需要消耗多少计算量和能量。	Most humans can walk, manipulate objects, and understand complex language from an early age, never paying much attention to the amount of computation and energy needed to perform these tasks.
现在，他必须一鼓作气，仿效印度，在本国创造出一个公开的，具有包容性的氛围。 让僧伽罗人和泰米尔人共荣共生。	He must now follow up by creating an open, inclusive environment, like India’s, that will enable both Sinhalese and Tamils to thrive.
尽管西方政治家可能会对克里姆林宫破坏现状的努力作出强硬表态 ，但他们的所作所为却往往暴露出虚弱的真面目。	And although Western politicians may talk tough in response to the Kremlin’s efforts to upend the status quo, their actions often betray a weaker hand.

但有些隔夜贷款人可以获取更高的利率 — — 只要他们肯接受安全系数较低的抵押贷款资金池作为抵押品，很多人也都采纳了这一选项。	But overnight lenders could command even higher interest rates if they took as collateral a less-safe mortgage pool, so many did just that.
镀金时代的不平等性在全球北方的社会民主时期，即1930年到1980年间大幅扭转，其间对富人课税的增加帮助支付了政府福利和计划。	Gilded Age inequality was significantly reversed during the period of social democracy in the global north, between 1930 and 1980, when higher taxes on the wealthy helped pay for new government benefits and programs.
可以肯定，美国可以通过拦截美元交易对毒枭和恐怖组织进行严厉打击，合法的银行经理仅仅想到失去美元交易资格也会吓得脸色发白。	To be sure, the US can strike a severe blow against terrorist organizations and drug kingpins by preventing them from transacting in dollars, and legitimate banks’ managers turn pale at the mere thought of losing dollar access.
当时国际货币基金组织借钱给负债累累的国家，将将能够挽救全球银行体系；债务违约得以避免，但代价却是旷日持久的经���低迷。	Back then, the International Monetary Fund saved the global banking system by lending just enough money to heavily indebted countries; default was avoided, but at the cost of a lasting depression.
如果没有哪家生产企业站出来提供所需的钢材，那么申请人按照规定可以在公众审查期结束七天内得到一年的豁免资质。	If no producer steps forward to furnish the needed steel, the applicant is supposed to receive a one-year exemption within seven days after the public-review period.
目前推特朗普政府的重点还相当困难，但很显然，特朗普政府对于采取哪些政策让增长模式变得更加平等和可持续，还没有形成任何一致的小范围焦点。	While it is hard to detect the Trump administration’s priorities at this point, it would be hard to argue that they include a concerted and narrow focus on policies designed to make growth patterns more equitable and sustainable.
它们加起来将在未来五年向六个合作国家的能源部门提供70多亿美元的融资、贸易信用、保险、小企业补助和直接政府支持。	Together, they will commit more than $7 billion over five years in financing, trade credits, insurance, small business grants, and direct government support to the energy sector in six partner countries.
虽然仍有一些女性领导人是在某种程度上利用家族影响力登台，但她们如今却开始更自信地将妇女事务直接列为自身政治议程的核心。	We still have women leaders who came to power at least partly because of their family ties. But they now seem to use their positions with far more confidence in putting women and their concerns squarely at the center of their agendas.
二战后哈里·杜鲁门总统在世界政治领域放弃孤立并开启“美国世纪”的决策导致了永久性的伙伴关系和海外军事存在。	The turn away from isolation and the beginning of the “American century” in world politics was marked by President Harry Truman’s decisions after WWII, which led to permanent alliances and a military presence abroad.
今年春天将不会出现巴勒斯坦国;全球气候变化协议或新的贸易协定也不会达成；贫困、种族灭绝的行为或疾病的流行也不会马上结束。	There will be no Palestinian state this spring; nor will there be a global climate change pact or a new trade accord or an end to poverty or genocide or disease anytime soon.
即使假设利率在2016年上升到1—1.5 % ， 它们也远低于历史水平，不管是绝对水平还是相对通胀的水平。	And even assuming that interest rates reach 1-1.5% by the end of 2016, they will still be very low by historic standards, both in absolute terms and relative to inflation.
此外也没有切实证据支持特朗普政府关于更快增长带来的滴流效益将“在极为保守估计下令美国家庭平均收入每年增加4000美元”的声明。	Moreover, there is no credible evidence to support the Trump administration’s declaration that the trickle-down benefits of faster growth will “increase average household income in the United States by, very conservatively, $4,000 annually.”
太多领导人对国内民族主义者和民粹主义者只是动动嘴皮子，错误地认为这样就能捍卫他们的国内支持率，而他们实际上应该表现出真正的领导力以及为人民利益而斗争。	Too many leaders are paying lip service to domestic nationalists and populists, mistakenly thinking that this will preserve their domestic poll ratings, when they should be showing genuine leadership and fighting for the common good.

他的参选使奥孔乔-伊韦拉看上去像一个只为某区域服务的“非洲候选人 ” ， 而奥坎普本人则被视为“拉美”候选人。	His candidacy made Okonjo-Iweala look like a regional “African candidate,” while Ocampo was the “Latin American” candidate.
或者他们将依靠非正统或为经检验的经济模型来论证他们的减税真的是税收收入中性的，并能给增长带来比标准模型所预测的更大的影响。	Or they might rely on unorthodox and untested economic models to claim that their cuts actually are revenue-neutral, and will have a much larger impact on growth than what standard models project.
这项涉及大约170个金融机构的倡议还预计到2020年市场对清洁和可再生能源的投资可能会达到19000亿美元。	The Initiative, which involves some 170 financial institutions, also estimates that market financing for clean and renewable energies could reach $1.9 trillion by 2020.
当然，选举制度有利于大党的程度 — — 通过议会普选高门槛，或通过选区赢者通吃制 — — 影响着政治碎片化的程度。	Of course, the extent to which an electoral system favors large parties – by having high popular-vote thresholds to enter parliament, or through winner-take-all constituencies – affects the degree of political fragmentation.
国家政要不能继续宣称布鲁塞尔或欧盟委员会是所有问题的根源，同时实行以自我为中心的短视政策并最终导致危机进一步加剧。	National political figures cannot continue to claim that Brussels or the European Commission is the source of all their problems, and pursue self-centered and shortsighted measures that ultimately exacerbate crises.
但尽管正在采取某些措施 — — 去年9月召开的一次联合国高级别会议提出了某些国际政策建议 — — 但采取的措施还远远不够。	But while some steps are being taken – a high-level United Nations meeting last September produced proposals for some international measures – they are far from adequate.
特别是，它们可以用比较昂贵的国家的生产成本作为中国真正成本的标准，这样就提高了发现倾销的可能性和倾销利润估计。	In particular, they could use production costs in more expensive countries as a proxy for true Chinese costs, increasing both the likelihood of a dumping finding and the estimated margin of dumping.
在柏林，越来越多的人提出这样一个问题 ： “ 这对德国来说意味着什么 ？ ” 而不问“这对欧洲来说意味着什么 ？ ”	In Berlin, the question asked more and more often is, “What does this mean for Germany?” rather than, “What does this mean for Europe?”
随着在1840年代将自由贸易赋予世界的英国现在决定独自行事，这对《大西洋宪章》的老盟友正在将国家主权置于全球公共物品之上。	With the UK, which gave the world free trade in the 1840s, having now decided to go it alone, the old Atlantic Charter allies are putting national sovereignty ahead of global public goods.

欧洲已经拥有可观的规范的实力 — — 即通过所谓的布鲁塞尔效应建立全球标准的能力 — — 其对科技公司的约束就是明证。	Europe already has considerable normative power – that is, the capacity to create global standards through the so-called Brussels effect – which can be seen in its efforts to rein in technology companies.
但美国宪法的一个基本原则是国会控制钱袋子 — — 这意味着自由裁量支出，比如建造边境墙的开支 — — 要经过正式的拨款程序。	But a fundamental principle of the US Constitution is that Congress controls the purse strings – meaning that discretionary spending, such as outlays for a border wall, is subject to the formal appropriations process.
在相当晦涩的言辞辩论中，哈马斯在以前的谈判中拒绝承诺“遵守”过去巴解组织与以色列订立的协议，而是提出要“尊重”协议内容。	In a rather obscure linguistic debate, Hamas has in previous negotiation rounds refused to “commit’ itself to past PLO agreements with Israel, but has instead offered to “respect” them.
格罗克•马尔克斯（1890-1977，美国著名喜剧演员-译者）曾有一句嘲讽的名言说他不愿意加入任何一家愿意吸收他为会员的俱乐部。	Groucho Marx once famously quipped that he did not want to join any club that would have him as a member.
换句话说，如果你不能及时偿还按揭款，贷款人可以取消你的贷款偿还权并收走你的房子 — — 过去十年有几百万屋主有过这种经验。	In other words, if you fail to make your payments on time, the lender can foreclose on the loan and take possession of the property – as millions of homeowners have experienced in the last decade.
第二个力量是数字经济的“赢家基本通吃”市场，这意味着主宰企业拥有过大的权力，可以提高价格而不会失去许多客户。	The second force is the digital economy’s “winner-takes-most” markets, which give dominant firms excessive power to raise prices without losing many customers.
如果欧盟想要解决能源安全、竞争性定价和可持续性等方面的关键挑战，就需要统一、全面和令人信服的政策方针。	If the EU is to address the key challenges of energy security, competitive pricing, and sustainability, it will need a unified, comprehensive, and compelling policy approach.

因此，中国让朝鲜就范的能力 — — 特别是美国相信习近平有此能力 — — 实际上取决于让解放军完全听命于中央的意义更加重大的斗争。	Thus, China’s ability to bring North Korea into line – a capacity that the US, in particular, believes Xi has – may in fact depend on the outcome of a more epochal struggle to bring the PLA fully under central authority.
不仅如此，曾一度成为工薪阶层白人高收入主要来源的制造业岗位在过去一代人间急剧下降，目前仅占劳动力总量的12 % 。	Moreover, manufacturing employment, once a prime source of high-paying jobs for working-class whites, has fallen sharply over the last generation, to just 12% of the workforce.
许多注意力都被集中到了两位总统候选人外交政策的不同上面，而这在许多方面是既明显又值得注意的，是有充分理由的。	For good reason, much attention is focused on foreign policy differences between the two nominees, which in many areas are both obvious and considerable.
尽管俄中天然气协议经过漫长谈判终告成功，或许反映了两国关系的深化，但中国从俄罗斯那里要到了极低的天然气价。	Though the conclusion of long-negotiated gas deals between Russia and China may seem to reflect a deepening of the bilateral relationship, China extracted an exceedingly low price from Russia for the gas that it will receive.
更严重的是，城市的空气污染率往往更高，尤其是化石燃料和生物质燃烧所产生的微细颗粒物（PM）每年造成高达三百万人死亡。	Making matters worse, cities tend to have higher rates of air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM) resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, which contributes to up to three million deaths every year.

农业投资是改善非洲食品安全的最为有效的方式，同时还要确保处在气候变化斗争第一线的民众能够保持繁荣的经济发展和可持续的健康环境。	Investing in agriculture is the most efficient way to improve food security in Africa, while ensuring that people on the front lines of the fight against climate change can maintain thriving economies and sustainable, healthy environments.
以葡萄酒为例： 既可以按价格、年份、原产地分类，也可以分为红酒、白酒或玫瑰红酒，还可以分为有气或无气。	Consider wines: you can sort them by price, year, or region of origin, by red, white, or rosé, or by sparkling or still.
而来自南部的获胜者洛朗·巴博（Laurent Gbagbo）又在2005年拒绝承认被瓦塔拉所击败，导致一系列暴力冲突，还引发了爆发长期内战以及发生潜在种族灭绝事件的担忧。	The winner, the southerner Laurent Gbagbo, then refused to concede his defeat by Ouattara in 2010, leading to violent conflict and fear of a long and potentially genocidal civil war.
土耳其对军事政变策划者的里程碑式的审判如今被广泛认为是冤假错案 — — 是基于脆弱甚至完全捏造的证据的政治迫害。	Turkey’s landmark trials of the alleged military-coup plotters are now widely recognized for what they were – witch hunts based on evidence that was flimsy at best, and often simply concocted.
继2011年欧洲法院裁定上述细胞构成人类胚胎后，英国和其他国家均延迟甚至拒绝为单性生殖细胞申请专利。	Following a ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2011 that those cells constitute human embryos, patent applications for parthenogenetic cells in the United Kingdom and other countries have been delayed and even rejected.

一个有趣的问题是：如果德国和法国开始废除现行规则并引入一个运作成熟的财政联盟，当下那些支持脱欧的人又会怎样想？	The interesting question is: How would those who support Brexit today feel had Germany and France moved to scrap the current rules and usher in a fully-fledged fiscal union?
相反，由于这种调整导致的可持续繁荣将会为继续在欧洲寻求一个“更紧密的联盟”创造一个更加健康的长期基础。	On the contrary, the sustainable prosperity that would result from that adjustment would create a much healthier long-term foundation for continuing the quest for an “ever closer union” in Europe.

华沙—不知何时才能结束的欧元区财政问题争论过度地关注了正式援助，特别是计划中的欧洲央行大规模购买国债的方案。	WARSAW – The seemingly never-ending debate over the eurozone’s fiscal problems has focused excessively on official bailouts, in particular the proposed purchase of government bonds on a massive scale by the European Central Bank.

阿卜杜拉继承其父法赫德（执政23年，2005年去世）后，建立了一个效忠委员会（Allegiance Council ） ， 这是一个外人莫名其妙的神秘家族机构，类似于梵蒂冈枢机主教团。	After Abdullah succeeded his brother Fahd, who ruled for 23 years until his death in 2005, he created an Allegiance Council, an ambiguous and mysterious family body that resembled the Vatican’s College of Cardinals.
虽然不一定完美也不够全面，但这样做的目的不是要解决所有问题，而是准确找出一小部分可以用来解释关键因素的变量。	The objective is not to account for everything, but rather to pinpoint a small number of variables than can explain key factors, albeit neither perfectly nor fully.
在2017年，他们需要重新评估全球经济的运作模式，并以此重新校准其对每只在售股票或债券的评估，因为即使某些市场基本面保持不变，许多其他因素也会有所改变。	In 2017, they will need to reappraise how the global economy works, and recalibrate accordingly their assessment of every stock or bond on sale, because even if some market fundamentals remain the same, many others have clearly changed.
同样令人不安的是五角大楼力促研发装配核武器的无人驾驶飞机 — — 此类飞机可以通过远程控制投掷氢弹。	Just as unsettling is the Pentagon’s push for the development of nuclear-armed drones – H-bombs deliverable by remote control.
20世纪90年代初以来，联合国和非盟在索马里的干预包括派驻来自美国和该国主要基督教邻国，肯尼亚和埃塞俄比亚的部队。	Since the early 1990s, interventions by the United Nations and the African Union in Somalia have included troops from the United States and from the country’s predominantly Christian neighbors, Kenya and Ethiopia.
欧盟委员会目前所提出的解决之道 — — 比如鼓励众筹和证券化条件标准化 — — 似乎无助于刺激非银行融资的快速增长。	And the remedies that the Commission has suggested so far – for example, encouraging crowdfunding and standardizing the terms of securitization – appear unlikely to promote rapid growth in non-bank finance.
欧洲中央银行可能会扩大其债券购买计划；但鉴于欧元区失业率仍然维持在平均为10％左右，表明产量距离理想状态依然存在相当差距，使其有必要检讨一下量化宽松政策的成果。	The European Central Bank will likely extend its bond-purchasing program; but it has reason to question the results of its quantitative-easing policy, given that eurozone unemployment still averages around 10%, indicating a sizeable output gap.
同样，奥巴马政府的政策制定者们仍然在为自己阻止了大萧条重演而相互道贺，并表示尽管2010年中期选举后共和党不断利用其议会大多数地位来捣乱，但自己也做出了最大的努力。	Likewise, Obama administration policymakers still pat themselves on the back for preventing a second Great Depression, and say they did the best they could, given recalcitrant Republican congressional majorities after the 2010 midterm elections.
此外还可以取消美国核武三元配备中陆基部分的现代化计划，该计划预计在未来30年内产生至少1.24万亿美元的费用，却对改善国家安全作用不大。	Furthermore, they could cancel plans to modernize the land-based component of the US nuclear triad, which is projected to cost at least $1.24 trillion over 30 years while failing to improve national security.
因为经济的年基本增长率（未计算气候变化影响）被设定为1.3 % ， 那么2020年损失20%相当于把年增长率降到1.2 % 。	Since the base rate of economic growth (before calculating the climate change effect) was taken to be 1.3% per year, a loss of 20% in the year 2200 amounts to reducing the annual growth rate to 1.2%.
同时“物联网”可以合理安排生产工艺并早期发现潜在故障，监测土地湿度以提高作物产量，并显著降低远程监控患者健康的费用。	And the “Internet of things” will rationalize production processes by detecting potential failures early, boost crop yields by measuring the moisture of fields, and dramatically reduce the cost of remotely monitoring patients’ health.
例如脑部扫描显示，每当人们听到他们认为是真实的表述 — — 该表述事实上真实与否其实无关紧要 — — 多巴胺就会冲击神经。	For example, brain scans show that when people hear a statement that they believe is true – the veracity is irrelevant – they get a dopamine hit.
就其本身而言，财政政策会受到庞大预算赤字和公共债务膨胀的制肘，许多国家甚至实施紧缩政策来确保债务可持续性。	Fiscal policy, for its part, was constrained by large budget deficits and rising stocks of public debt, with many countries even implementing austerity to ensure debt sustainability.
这项新奖项产生于一个由来已久的冲突：一方是富裕阶层（better off）的利益，即物价稳定；另一方是其他所有人的利益，即通过税收、社会投资和转移支付等手段降低不安全感。	The new prize arose from a longstanding conflict between the interests of the better off in stable prices and the interests of everybody else in reducing insecurity by means of taxation, social investment, and transfers.
尽管为独立工作服务的数字平台仍处于发展早期阶段，并且只被15%的独立工作者使用，但它们正在蓬勃发展，迅速扩张。	While digital platforms for independent work are still in the early stages of their development, and are being used by only 15% of independent workers, they are proliferating and expanding rapidly.
德国经济思想以前凯恩斯时代的思想为正统，德国人从道德上讨厌“借贷的罪恶 ” （ 而因此忽视总需求 ） ， 这也起不了促进作用。	The persistence of pre-Keynesian orthodoxy in German economic thought, with its moral abhorrence of the “sin of borrowing” (and thus its neglect of aggregate demand), does not help, either.
事实上，许多发展中国家，因为害怕如发生在1997年亚洲金融危机中的情况出现，即把经济主权丧失给了国际货币基金组织，它们因此积累了数千亿美元的外汇储备。	Indeed, many developing countries, fearful of losing their economic sovereignty to the IMF – as occurred during the 1997 Asian financial crisis – accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves.
这一行动有可能必须等到低增长、高不平等、国际贸易和投资不信任以及央行失去独立性的后果大到难以承受才有可能实施。	Such action will probably have to wait until the political consequences of low growth, high inequality, mistrust of international trade and investment, and the loss of central-bank independence become too great to bear.
在这种团结的鼓舞下，并借助像大都会、C40城市及百强城市等国际网络建立的相互联系，各地市政领袖正在形成伙伴关系，共同制定统一的城市规划。	Inspired by this solidarity, and connected through international networks like Metropolis, C40 Cities, and 100 Resilient Cities, municipal leaders everywhere are forging partnerships to create united urban agendas.
韩国已经和美国加强了军事同盟，日本先前要求美军空军基地撤出冲绳，如今也重投美国的怀抱。 在亚洲诸国中，印度、越南，印尼和菲律宾都和美国走得更近了。	South Korea has tightened its military alliance with the US, Japan has backed away from a move to get the US to move its Marine airbase out of Okinawa, and India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, among others, have drawn closer to the US.
"该法官总结说德克萨斯的狱警经常依赖于过渡的暴力，官员对性奴役置若罔闻，且该州的隔离单位功能（isolation units function）成为""心理变态的有效孵化器 "" 。"	"Texas prison guards regularly rely on excessive force, the judge concluded, officials ignore sexual enslavement, and the state's isolation units function as ""virtual incubators of psychoses."""
比如，在高速公路项目的早期阶段，道路设计和建设的地质学、未来交通流量、环境影响以及公众反应都未知或未能全知。	For example, in the early phase of a highway project, the geology relevant for road design and construction, the amount of future traffic, the environmental impact, and the public response are unknown or only partly known.
来自150个国家的5,000多名全球领导人、决策者和支持者与会讨论如何打破损害妇女健康的贫困和性别不平等的循环以及其他问题。	More than 5,000 global leaders, policymakers, and advocates from 150 countries are convening to discuss, among other issues, how to break the cycle of poverty and gender inequality that undermines women’s health.
尽管阻止全球违禁核材料的防扩散安全倡议（PSI）已经生效，但据国际原子能机构报告仍存在少量的核材料走私。	While the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is already in place to stop the smuggling of nuclear contraband worldwide, the International Atomic Energy Agency reports continued trafficking of small amounts of nuclear material.
比如在4月，美国财政部部长杰克·卢宣布5、10和20美元的纸币将采用全新图案，上述全新图案包括女性及人权运动领袖。	For example, in April, United States Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced that the $5, $10, and $20 bills will be replaced with new designs that include women and civil-rights leaders.
联合国发展计划（UNDP）将社会和经济包容列为其2016年人类发展报告《为了每个人的人类发展 》 （ Human Development for Everyone）的主题就是明证。	To highlight this problem, the United Nations Development Program has made social and economic inclusion a major theme of its 2016 Human Development Report, “Human Development for Everyone.”
"与此同时，随着执委会的技术内涵日益减少、政治内涵日益扩大，所谓的""民主赤字""问题也会变得越来越突出。"	"At the same time, to the extent that the Commission becomes less a body of technocrats and more a political body, the so-called ""democratic deficit"" will increasingly become a problem."
毕竟，群众示威运动并未形成气候；巴沙尔牢牢地控制着叙利亚；而既无宪法又无议会的埃及即使不能说陷入了一片混乱，显然也在和民主渐行渐远。	After all, popular protests have failed to gather steam; Bashar al-Assad’s regime has held firm in Syria; and Egypt, with neither a constitution nor a parliament, has apparently veered from democracy, if not descended into chaos.
而且，像戴高乐一样，普京通过确立符合国家使命和尊严的大众感觉，以及被解释为“主权”的国家利益的作用寻求把他的国家从屈辱和失败中解救出来。	And, like de Gaulle, Putin has sought to rescue his country from humiliation and defeat by carving out a role consonant with popular feelings of national mission and pride, with national interest interpreted as “sovereignty.”
伦敦 — — 7月9日，世界上最大经济体的国家首脑们将在意大利的拉奎拉聚会，参加主要经济体论坛（MEF ） 。 在会上，大家将讨论如何推进全球气候协议的达成。	LONDON – On July 9, the leaders of the world’s largest economies will meet in L’Aquila, Italy, at the Major Economies Forum (MEF) to discuss progress towards a new global climate agreement.
但乌克兰和俄罗斯天然气争端所提出的问题已经超越了能源安全的范畴，它再次将乌克兰在欧洲和世界的地位问题摆在了我们面前。	But the issues raised by the gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia go beyond energy security, reviving questions about Ukraine’s place in Europe and the world.
伯克利 — — “那只不过是希腊危机 ” ， “那只不过是希腊和爱尔兰的危机 ” ， 人们曾经那样以为，可是现在不行了，因为那显然已经是一场欧元区的危机。	BERKELEY – What once could be dismissed as simply a Greek crisis, or simply a Greek and Irish crisis, is now clearly a eurozone crisis.
德国南部的法兰克人讨厌拿破仑战争迫使他们遵守巴伐利亚规则这一事实，他们将建立德国视为利用普鲁士和柏林作为制衡慕尼黑领导权的机制。	Franconians in southern Germany disliked the fact that the Napoleonic Wars subjected them to Bavarian rule; they saw German nationalism as a way to use Prussia and Berlin as a counterweight to Munich’s hegemony.
在2010年为防止金融形势继续恶化而紧急成立的欧洲财政稳定基金（EFSF）将很快具备筹集500亿欧元资金的能力，足以帮助那些遭遇严重流动性问题的国家渡过难关。	The European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF), hurriedly established in May 2010 in an effort to stop the rot, will shortly be able to call on some €500 billion in the event that any more eurozone countries face serious liquidity problems.
在美国，定期资产抵押政权贷款便利（Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility，TALF）和公私投资计划（Public-Private Investment Program，PPIP）便是事实上的以次级按揭贷款持有者为目标的债务免除机制，但规模实在太小。	In the US, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) program and the Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP) were in effect debt-forgiveness schemes aimed at sub-prime mortgage holders, but on too small a scale.
到目前为止，死亡人数累计达到22人，其中很多人是儿童。 这使得曼彻斯特体育馆恐袭事件成为造成52人死亡的2005年7月伦敦地铁爆炸案之后英国最严重的恐怖事件。	So far, the death toll stands at 22, many of them children, making the attack on the Manchester Arena Britain’s worst encounter with terrorism since the London Underground bombings in July 2005, which killed 52.
在美国的大错被纠正、阿拉伯世界正在走向完整时，这些国家为它们所想见到的逊尼派重握政权投入了巨大的代价 — — 2010年国民选举就是明证。	These states contribute enormously – as they did in the 2010 national elections – to what they hope will be a Sunni restoration, when the Americans’ great error is corrected and the Arab world is made whole.
此外，国民阵线的经济计划也确实和左翼阵线（Left Front，由法国共产党和左翼党组成的选举联盟）十分相似。	And, indeed, the National Front’s economic program is rather similar to that of the Left Front (an electoral bloc comprising the French Communist Party and the Left Party).
但是根据安迪·瑞德利（Andy Ridley）的说法 ， “ 地球一小时”实际上还有一个更具体的目标。	But according to Andy Ridley, Earth Hour actually has a more specific agenda than that.
巴勒斯坦、阿拉伯国家和其他以穆斯林为主体人口的国家允许以色列不承认巴勒斯坦难民不可剥夺的返回故土的权利。	By accepting the words “agreed upon,” Palestinians, Arabs, and other Muslim-majority countries have conceded that Israel will not recognize Palestinian refugees’ inalienable right to return to their homes.
这两个国家的两个极右翼政党 — — 法国国民阵线（French National Front）和荷兰自由党（Dutch Freedom Party）如今抢在2014年5月的欧洲议会选举前结成了同盟。	Two far-right parties from these countries, the French National Front and the Dutch Freedom Party, have now formed an alliance ahead of the European Parliament elections in May 2014.
当荷兰1988年得报一箭之仇，击败德国队成为欧洲杯冠军时，上街跳舞欢庆的荷兰人比1945年真正的战争结束日还要多。	When the Dutch had their revenge in 1988 and beat Germany to go on to become European champions, more people danced in the streets in Holland than on the day that the real war ended in May 1945.
如果巴勒斯坦领导人真的希望结束加沙的暴力循环，就必须从解决自身内部争端，形成一个团结、可靠、有担当的谈判方开始。	If Palestine’s leaders truly want to end the cycle of violence in Gaza, they must begin by resolving their own internal disagreements and present themselves as a cohesive, reliable, and committed negotiating party.
在任何情况下，实行新的SDR分配都需要国际货币基金组织董事会85%的票数支持。 由于主要股东都反对，这一提案在可以预见的将来还不能实现。	In any case, new SDR allocations require the support of 85% of votes within the IMF’s board, which appears unachievable in the foreseeable future, as major shareholders are opposed.
这些因素缓和了信贷质量的风险，加之65%左右的存贷比相对较低，应该可以为中国的银行系统提供必要的缓冲。	That tempers the risks to credit quality and, along with relatively low loan-to-deposit ratios of around 65%, should cushion the Chinese banking system.
虽然每吨375美元是一个非常高的价格，反映了当前石油的极低价格，但即使是较低的碳价 — — 每吨150~250美元的范围 — — 都将足以满足未来十年的国际气候目标。	While $375 per ton is a very high price, reflecting the particularly low price of oil today, even a lower carbon price – in the range of $150-250 per ton – would be sufficient to meet international climate goals over the next decade.
两种类型世界都需要，取决于具体的情况，但我们需要避免的错误是想当然地认为变革型园林设计师就一定比谨慎的园丁更好。	There is a role for both, depending on the context, but we should avoid the common mistake of automatically thinking that the transformational landscape architect is a better leader than the careful gardener.
如果我们不知道我们会在孟加拉国工厂流水线上工作还是在美国朝阳高管办公室上班，就不会有人否认保证孟加拉国工人健康和安全的责任。	If we didn’t know whether we would be working on a factory floor in Bangladesh or in a shiny head office in the United States, no one would disavow responsibility for the health and safety of Bangladeshi workers.
例如，像高素质劳动力等因素，或者整合进入运行良好的产业集群中所带来的好处，或许都发挥着更重要的作用。	For example, factors like highly qualified labor, or the benefits of being integrated into well-functioning clusters, probably play a more important role.
而那些反对如此普遍使用药物的人则特别指出狂躁抑郁症的诊断率爆增了40倍，没有过度诊断也就不可能有过度用药。	Those opposed to such rampant use of drugs note that diagnostic rates for bipolar disorder, in particular, have skyrocketed by 4,000% and that overmedication is impossible without over-diagnosis.
比如，要尽量减轻在不熟悉的监管和法律环境中经营的风险，企业应该事先建立好与当地各方面利益相关者的联系，以有效进行在当地的建设、经营管理和社会活动。	For example, to minimize the risks associated with operating in an unfamiliar regulatory and legislative environment, businesses should establish links in advance with a local entity to guide their activities.
在2011年及2012年初有很多关于中国房地产市场崩盘及地下信贷网络和地方政府金融平台违约的连锁反应的言论。	In 2011 and early 2012, there was much talk of a crash in China’s housing market, and a chain-reaction of defaults in underground credit networks and local-government finance platforms.
国内外公司均增加在美投资能够刺激经济增长，与此同时，由此带来的资本增加 — — 新企业、工厂、设备和研究 — — 能够改善生产率。	Higher investment in the US by both domestic and foreign companies would boost economic growth, while the resulting increase in capital – new businesses, factories, equipment, and research –would improve productivity.
药品在市场上不成功有两个主要原因，其一是药品在人体内没有产生药效，其二就是药品本身存在不可预测的毒性。	The two major causes of drug failure are lack of efficacy in humans and unexpected toxicity.
无论如何，如果只是为了表明结构改革符合各国自身利益，那么不进行必要改革的成本肯定会被实施改革的成本所抵消。	In any case, the costs of not carrying out necessary reforms would have to be offset against the costs of doing so, if only to make clear that structural reforms are in individual countries’ own interest.
从1918年到1939年国际经济合作非常罕见 — — 这在很大程度上是因为由引人注目的国际会议统一审核所有的拟定议案。	From 1918 to 1939, international economic cooperation was hard to come by – in large part because all of the attempted deals were put together at high-profile international conferences.
供给的增加 — — 特别是来自北美的页岩资源的供给 — — 给价格造成下降压力，与此同时，欧元区、日本、中国和其他新兴市场需求减少也起到了同样的效果。	And, while increased supply – particularly from North American shale resources – has put downward pressure on prices, so has weaker demand in the eurozone, Japan, China, and many emerging markets.
他们多数已经开通了Twitter或Facebook账户，或者频繁地在YouTube上发帖，目的是让所在国（以及美国本土）民众了解他们的日常活动，偶尔表达对某个问题的看法，甚至表露他们的心情。	Most have a Twitter or Facebook account, or post frequently on YouTube, in order to keep the public in the countries where they serve (and at home) informed of their daily activities, or occasionally their thinking about an issue or even their mood.
这一概念并不新颖：比如，几十年前人们就已经知道，有的人体内一种叫G6PD的酶存在基因缺陷，某些药物可以导致他们产生严重的急性贫血。	This concept is not new: it has been known for decades, for example, that people who have a genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD can experience severe and precipitous anemia if they are exposed to certain drugs.
这一逻辑或许促使莫迪决定邀请SAARC领导人 — — 包括巴基斯坦的纳瓦兹·沙里夫（Nawaz Sharif ） — —出席他的总理宣誓就职仪式。	This logic likely drove Modi’s decision to invite SAARC leaders – including Pakistan’s Nawaz Sharif – to witness his swearing in as Prime Minister.
本着这样的宗旨，催化剂基金会正在评估区域内及东欧、非洲及美国的公民教育试点项目 — — 目的是研究学校课程如何才能最有效地培育不同信仰群体间的相互理解。	With this in mind, the Catalyst Foundation is assessing pilot civic-education projects in the region – as well as in Eastern Europe, Africa, and the United States – to determine how school curricula can best cultivate inter-faith understanding.
由世界最大发达经济体和主要新兴经济体组成的G-20 — — 但目前仍未在世界舞台上留下浓墨重彩 — — 在匹兹堡召开会议，制定应对全球金融危机的措施。	The G-20, an assembly of the world’s largest developed and major emerging economies – which had thus far failed to make a serious mark on the world stage – was meeting in Pittsburgh to formulate a response to the global financial crisis.
上周，欧洲央行决定暂停向希腊银行系统供应流动性，导致希腊银行关门，这一做法十分不智，并且具有灾难性结果。	The ECB’s decision last week to withhold credit to the country’s banking system, and thereby to shutter the banks, was both inept and catastrophic.
北极本身的变暖速度远快于地球平均水平，可能造成全球范围的严重气候破坏 — — 美国中纬度地区最近所观察到的极端天气也许也是因此导致的。	The Arctic itself is warming far faster than the planetary average, potentially causing massive, global-scale climate disruptions – which may include the extreme weather patterns recently observed in the US mid-latitudes.
它单方面拒绝在泰柬边境部署区域观察员的安排，而这一安排是由印尼外交部长马提·纳塔莱加瓦在2月斡旋设立的。	It unilaterally ruled out the presence of regional observers on the Thai-Cambodian border, a deal mediated by Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa in February.
美国和欧盟是最大的外国投资来源地和目的地，占全球FDI流出总量的56%和流入总量的42 % ， 它们在确保国际投资机制的良好运转上利益最大。	As the two largest sources and destinations for foreign investment, accounting for a combined 56% of global FDI outflows and 42% of inflows, the US and EU have a particular interest in ensuring a well-functioning international investment regime.
但对民粹主义者来说，真正的敌人（可能比移民本身更为邪恶）则是那些容忍甚至鼓励这类恐怖行动的“城市精英阶层 ” 。	For the populists, however, the real enemies – perhaps even more nefarious than the immigrants themselves – are the “cosmopolitan elites” who tolerate and even encourage these horrors.
一是所谓的愿景2030计划，即实现沙特经济多样化，降低对石油收入的严重依赖，创造石油业之外的优质工作岗位。	The first, which he outlines in a program called Vision 2030, is to diversify the Saudi economy, by reducing its heavy dependence on oil revenues, and creating good jobs outside of the oil sector.
它们也明白，在自利前提下，如果外国消费者认为使用美国社交媒体和搜索引擎会让他们暴露在美国情报机构的监视下，这些消费者就会转向其他提供商。	They also understand, in a more self-interested vein, that if foreign consumers believe that using American social media and search engines exposes them to the scrutiny of US intelligence agencies, those consumers will turn to other providers.
归根结底，中国的政治制度已经是“有中国特色的社会主义 ” ， 包含着越来越多的市场经济的成分，经济开放和透明度也在日益增加。	After all, if China’s political system can still be called socialism, it is at best “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” which embodies an increasing amount of market-oriented economic activity and greater economic openness and transparency.
政府经过长时间辩论与主要反对党达成了到2014年实现消费税从5%到8%翻番，而后到2015年再增长到10%的最新协议，这项协议表明日本的政治瘫痪已经结束。	The recent agreement, after a long debate, between the government and leading opposition parties to double the consumption tax – from 5% to 8% in 2014, and then to 10% in 2015 – suggests that it has.
但是，与美国在2008年危机前扩大房屋所有权的措施一样，中国的政策过犹不及，造成了一个金融上不可持续的局面，并极有可能出现剧烈的价格下跌和混乱。	But, like the United States’ effort to expand home ownership in the years preceding the 2008 crisis, Chinese policies went too far, creating a financially unsustainable situation that implied the possibility of major price declines and dislocations.
他们也许不喜欢这种依赖性，但他们更讨厌另一条路 ： “ 全新开始 ” ， 手握一手无法让他们获得曾经被视为中产阶级生活方式基本要求的烂牌。	While they may not like this kind of dependence, they dislike even more the alternative: a “fresh start” in which the cards are stacked against their attainment of anything approaching what was once viewed as a basic middle-class lifestyle.
而意大利官员（以及其他各国）在面对近期移民潮时的所作所为主要源自于其国内右翼民粹主义政党所施加的压力 — — 这些政党在政治上早已转受为攻了。	The problem for Italian officials, as for the other governments concerned by the recent migration flows, is the pressure of right-wing populist parties, which no longer need to be on the defensive.
发自剑桥 — — 自从土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安（Recep Tayyip Erdoğan）于2002年赢得了第一次大选以来，被政变夺权的梦魇就时时困扰着他。	CAMBRIDGE – Ever since Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won his first general election in late 2002, he has been obsessed with the idea that power would be wrested from him through a coup.
这些补贴是危险的；它们鼓励了过度承担风险和使用极高杠杆的行为 — — 这意味着每个银行的股本都需要应付大笔债务，而整体经济的债务比率也实在太高。	These subsidies are dangerous; they encourage excessive risk-taking and very high leverage – meaning a lot of debt relative to equity for each bank and far too much debt relative to the economy as a whole.
新成员国没有就集体的京都议定书目标达成共识，但是作为一个群体，它们计划到2010年，比 1990年削减大约20%的排放量。	The new members have not agreed to a collective Kyoto goal, but as a group they are projected to reduce emissions relative to 1990 by around 20% by 2010.
直至最近之前，市场似乎对这一轮轮冲击波视而不见。 除了有几天因为日本和中东恐慌而略有调整之外，各大金融市场持续上行。	Until recently, markets seemed to discount these shocks; apart from a few days when panic about Japan or the Middle East caused a correction, they continued their upward march.
就在谈判因为希腊举行公投而戛然而止之前，双方已经就希腊财政目标形成了一致；剩下的内容只是确定这��目标如何达到。	Right before the talks were abruptly cut off for Greece to hold its referendum, the two sides had agreed on fiscal targets for Greece; all that was left was to determine how the targets should be reached.
特朗普绝非第一位抱怨中国滥用知识产权的美国总统，他的抱怨也是正确的（尽管发动贸易战绝非解决方案 ） 。	Trump is hardly the first American president to complain on this score, and he is right to do so (though starting a trade war cannot be the solution).
2013年以来，习近平一直在推动中国的大规模“一带一路”计划，该计划旨在通过全球互通和基础设施投资刺激增长。	Since 2013, Xi has been rolling out China’s massive “one belt, one road” program, designed to stimulate growth through global connectivity and infrastructure investment.
事实上，基于达尔文的假设，大多数人类学家声称现代人类仅仅是克鲁马努人的后裔，因为后者消灭了其它更不适应竞争的对手。	In fact, based on Darwin’s assumptions, most anthropologists claim that modern humans were simply descended from Cro-Magnons, who had exterminated their less-fit adversaries.
而市场容易受到暂时性群情激昂的影响 — — 对象可以是新兴市场债务，可以是互联网股票，可以是住房按揭支持证券，可以是希腊政府债务。	And the market is prone to temporary fits of shared enthusiasm – for emerging-market debt, for Internet stocks, for residential mortgage-backed securities, for Greek government debt.
无论如何，有760万选民认为勒庞是领到法国的正确人选（投票前三天香榭丽舍大道发生的恐怖袭击可能增加了勒庞的票数 ） 。	Whatever the case, some 7.6 million voters have now acknowledged Le Pen as the right person to lead France (a total probably boosted by a terrorist attack on the Champs Elysées three days before the vote).
政府官员必须摆脱眼前利益的羁绊去理解叙利亚政策，比方说与俄罗斯、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、埃及和以色列保持必要接触。	Officials have an obligation to look beyond the current news cycle, and especially to understand that policy aimed at Syria, for example, engages policy toward Russia, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and Israel.
事实上，习近平的整风运动也许正在经历最危险的时刻 ， — —最近，成都军区副司令员被拿下，他的职位至关重要，因为成都军区需要负责地域广袤、桀骜不驯的藏区。	Indeed, the most perilous phase of Xi’s purge may now be underway, given the recent arrest of the deputy commander of the Sichuan Military District – a key post, given the district’s large and restive Tibetan population.
第二个关键资本来源是私人和社区慈善基金会，根据美国法律，这些机构每年至少要将5%的资产用于慈善目的。	A second key source of capital lies with private and community philanthropic foundations, which are required by US law to donate at least 5% of their assets to charitable causes annually.
但是，这一短视的重商主义手段在像达尔富尔那样的问题上造成外交问题，而且，这也并不在供应中断的时候可以切实确保提供给中国的供应。	However, while this short-sighted mercantilist approach creates foreign policy problems over issues like Darfur, it will not really protect China in a time of supply disruption.
而在条约签订之后，美国主持召开了一场核不扩散峰会，这对于把核不扩散斗争当作招牌政策的奥巴马政府来说堪称一个里程碑式的事件。	After the treaty was signed, the US hosted a nuclear non-proliferation summit, a landmark event for the Obama administration, which has made the fight against nuclear proliferation a trademark policy.
在冷战时期的美苏武器控制谈判，以及最近的伊朗核计划国际谈判中，西方和伊朗物理学家常常能够比政客更加容易地找到共同点。	During US-Soviet arms-control negotiations during the Cold War, and, more recently, during international negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, Western and Iranian physicists often found common ground more readily than the politicians.
从这个角度讲，能源效率增进70%是欧洲 — — 以及全世界 — — 在当前全球增长水平上实现真正的可持续性的最低要求。	Seen in this light, a 70% improvement in energy efficiency is the minimum Europe – and the world – can aim for to reach real sustainability at current levels of global growth.
格林斯潘以不愿意干预金融市场而闻名，即使在杠杆大幅提高、资产价格看起来早已脱离现实支撑的情况下也是如此，这才是问题的根源。	It was Greenspan’s notorious reluctance to intervene in financial markets, even when leverage was growing dramatically and asset prices seemed to have lost touch with reality, that created the problem.
在这种人看来，物价稳定可以减少不稳定因素，从而使公司和个人得以做出正确的决定，因此对经济活动有益无害。	Price stability, according to this view, reduces uncertainty, thereby enabling firms and individuals to take the right decisions, so it is good, not bad, for economic activity.
报告还批评了联合国对发生在波斯尼亚、卢旺达和达尔弗尔的种族屠杀行为的处理方法以及对于艾滋病情况处理的迟缓行动。	The report is critical of the organization’s performance on genocide in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Darfur, as well as the late response to HIV/AIDS.
也难怪，到2003年下半年末，政府准备动用法律手段 — — 以大规模税款申索的方式 — — 以打垮该公司的意图已十分明显。	Never mind that by the second half of 2003, it had become obvious that the government intended to use legal means – in the form of massive tax claims – to destroy the company.
推迟违约意味着为两国金融机构赢得时间去注入资本，使之能在贷款到期后不再继续借贷从而减少与希腊各银行的关联，并将希腊债券出售给欧洲央行。	Postponing a default gives the French and German financial institutions time to build up their capital, reduce their exposure to Greek banks by not renewing credit when loans come due, and sell Greek bonds to the European Central Bank.
因此越来越多的教职人员都穿着短袖衬衫授课，就像半个世纪以前加州理工学院（该校位于甚至更远的南部，在帕萨迪纳）的人们穿着的那样。	And so, more and more of us now lecture in short-sleeve button-down shirts like those worn a half-century ago by the denizens of CalTech (even farther south, in Pasadena).
美国剑桥—6月以来，石油价格暴跌40 % — —这对石油进口国来说是好消息，但对俄罗斯、委内瑞拉、尼日利亚和其他石油出口国来说是坏消息。	CAMBRIDGE – Oil prices have plummeted 40% since June – good news for oil-importing countries, but bad news for Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria, and other oil exporters.
而在叙利亚问题上，框架连提纲都算不上，因为该决议对于叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的政治命运以及下台时间只字未提。	In this case, it was less than that, because the resolution was silent about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s political fate and the timing of his departure.
不出五年 ， “ 被认为是‘不自由’的国家 — — 如中国、俄罗斯、沙特阿拉伯等 — — 所占全球收入比重将超过西方自由民主国家 。 ”	Within the next five years, “the share of global income held by countries considered ‘not free’ – such as China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia – will surpass the share held by Western liberal democracies.”
尽管存在海关管制以及其他类似原产地规则这样的贸易壁垒，但这将提供一条进入欧洲单一市场（不参与的欧盟农业和渔业政策）的近乎全方位的渠道。	That would provide almost full access to the single market (with opt-outs from EU agriculture and fisheries policies), albeit with customs controls and other trade barriers such as rules-of-origin requirements.
在下一次出现经济萧条，或地方经济遭受严重打击，或银行利息率迅速回升时，大城市的房价很有可能急剧下跌。	Prices in glamour cities are likely to drop sharply the next time there is a serious recession, or if the local economy suffers a severe shock, or if interest rates rise too fast.
如果他想要的只是安全，我们可以不管他，可以签订和平条约，放松制裁，让经济增长逐渐改变朝鲜政权（就像中国那样 ） 。	If all he wants is security, we could leave him alone, perhaps sign a peace treaty, relax sanctions, and let economic growth change the regime over time, as in China.
大部分家庭继续面临着收入停滞或下降 — — 年轻一代也因此将比父辈更加贫穷 — — 这样的情况更是急需这样的解决办法。	With most households continuing to face stagnating or falling incomes – and with younger generations thus on track to be poorer than their parents – such solutions are urgently needed.
事实上，约70%的香港上市公司都在加勒比地区进行过注册，就连包括互联网巨头阿里巴巴在内的一些大型内地企业也在海外避税天堂注册以求避税。	Indeed, some 70% of all Hong Kong-listed companies have a Caribbean registry, and even a number of major mainland companies, including the Internet giant Alibaba, are registered in offshore tax havens.
美国主要公司的领导人们都认为全球人为的气候变化是不争的事实，必须加以控制，而商界在这一过程中必须发挥建设性的作用。	Leaders of major US companies have decided that global man-made climate change is real, must be controlled, and that business must play a constructive part in the process.
类似地，在美国，对联邦政府权力的根深蒂固的怀疑 — — 特别是在权力被用来废除奴隶制和推进公民权利的南方 — — 导致美国人对反周期宏观经济政策怀有敌意。	Similarly, in the US, deep-rooted suspicion of federal government power – especially in the South, where it was used to abolish slavery and enforce civil rights – has resulted in hostility to countercyclical macroeconomic policy.
事实上，世界贸易组织再一次陷入了危机，印度政府威胁要否决去年在巴厘岛达成的促进贸易协定（Agreement on Trade Facilitation ） ， 因为它不同意其中食品存储和补贴的内容。	Indeed, the World Trade Organization is once again in jeopardy, with the Indian government threatening to veto the Agreement on Trade Facilitation reached in Bali last year, owing to disagreements about food stockpiling and subsidies.
得到了比尔·克林顿总统和托尼·布莱尔首相的首肯，Collins和Venter公开宣布在分子级别进行种族划分没有意义，因为人类99.9%的DNA完全一致。	With President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair nodding their approval, Collins and Venter agreed that racial classifications make no sense at the molecular level; we humans are 99.9% alike in our DNA.
吞并克里米亚后普京的国内支持率飙升，任何抗议活动真正破坏 — — 更不用说推翻其政府的可能性非常之低。	In the wake of his annexation of Crimea, Putin’s domestic approval rating has soared, and the chances that any protest would succeed in genuinely undercutting – much less toppling – his administration are very low.
虽然细节仍未明朗，但一场对欧洲政治现状的彻底重组 — — 这在很大程度上是由人们对欧洲的态度所决定的 — — 似乎是板上钉钉的事情。	Although the details remain unclear, a thorough restructuring of the European political scene – shaped largely by attitudes toward Europe – seems certain.
电缆传输技术的进步令爱尔兰和法国连接起来，那么即便英国议会投票选择置身于电网之外，也可以让前者有另一条连结欧洲能源市场的通路。	Advances in cable technology would allow Ireland to link to France, providing an alternative route to European markets if the UK elects to remain outside the network.
很多人相信，国大党秉承了务实的价值观，采取有利于经济发展和帮助穷人的政策，如果这样走下去，印度就会变成一个伟大的国家。	Many believe that Congress – with its commitment to secular values, economic growth, and helping the poor – now has a mandate to transform India into a great power.
比如，对石油来说，页岩气、致密油、液化天然气和竞争力日益增强的太阳能和风能正在刺激能源供给，即使十年来的高价刺激了储备，降低了需求。	When it comes to oil, for example, shale gas, tight oil, liquefied natural gas, and increasingly competitive solar and wind energy are boosting energy supply, even as a decade of high prices has spurred conservation and reduced demand.
塞尔维亚便是建立在冲突后的一系列妥协基础上的社会，十分适合在担任欧安组织主席国期间协调欧洲所急需的安全对话 — — 我们的转型便是在欧安组织的帮助下实现的。	Serbia, a post-conflict society built on a series of compromises, is well placed to coordinate Europe’s much-needed security dialogue during its chairmanship of the OSCE – an organization that helped us through our own transition.
如果苏格兰人希望获得主权，他们就需要自己的货币 — — 以及自己的中央银行：苏格兰银行将无法求助于英国最后贷款人。	If the Scots want sovereignty, they will need their own currency – and their own central bank: no British lender of last resort would be available to Scotland’s banks.
世界首家可再生能源/氢气混合发电厂 — — 既发电，也生产作汽车燃料使用的氢气 — — 在2011年秋开始投入生产。	And the world’s first renewable energy/hydrogen hybrid power plant, producing both electricity and hydrogen as car fuel, started production in the fall of 2011.
回归凯恩斯主义需求管理也许是即将履新的美国唐纳德·特朗普政府的主要经济红利，扩张性财政政策将取代效率低下的货币刺激。	A return to Keynesian demand management could be the main economic benefit of Donald Trump’s incoming US administration, as expansionary fiscal policies replace much less efficient efforts at monetary stimulus.
如果政府投资不得不成为主要的拉动力，那么修建急需的学校和医院也比修筑“偏远的桥梁”要好得多。 （就像日本在1990年代遭遇类似状况时所做的那样。	If government investment has to be the main vehicle, then it would be far better to build desperately needed schools and hospitals than “bridges to nowhere,” as Japan famously did when it went down a similar path in the 1990’s.
它们很可能是开放骗局，策划者引诱容易上当的业余爱好者绕过商业计划致命的漏洞，或者对漏洞遮遮掩掩，使用非常不起眼的小字进行披露。	It may well be open deception, with promoters steering gullible amateurs around a business plan’s fatal flaw, or disclosing it only grudgingly or in the fine print.
卫星的设计和制造还具有低成本的显著特征，总花费还不到7 300万美元，是其他极少数试图探索火星的国家的花费的五分之一。	They also did so at a remarkably low cost, with the total bill coming in at under $73 million, or about a fifth of what the few other countries that have sought to explore Mars have spent.
对应地，结构性合作最低限度必须将欧盟资金集中于存在长期经常项目赤字的国家，其目的必须是通过人力资本投资改善竞争力。	As a counterpart, structural coordination must, at a minimum, focus European Union funds on countries with long-term current-account deficits, the aim being to improve their competitiveness through investments in their human capital.
不但安倍本人否认了指控，前大阪大学教授八田达夫（<>Tatsuo Hatta）和前爱媛县知事加户守行（Moriyuki Kato）也作证整个决策过程是公平合法的。	Not only did Abe himself deny the accusations; Tatsuo Hatta, formerly of Osaka University, and Moriyuki Kato, former Governor of Ehime Prefecture, testified that the process had been conducted fairly and lawfully.
历史经验表明，新产业和机会将取代消失的旧产业和机会；尽管如此，转型过程将是十分痛苦的，并且可能延续几十年之久。	If history is a guide, new industries and opportunities will replace those that are lost; nonetheless, the transition will be painful and could last decades.
在某处，伊斯兰武装分子们正向着穆沙拉夫磨刀霍霍。 他们为他在阿富汗和克什米尔的隐蔽战争中立下汗马功劳，而后却被抛弃。	Somewhere out there, gunning for Musharraf, are Islamic militants furious at being dumped after they fought his covert wars in Afghanistan and Kashmir.
不像财政悬崖，结构性的赤字问题并非迫在眉睫的问题：与赤字鹰派危言耸听的警告相反，美国面对的并不是一个相对紧迫的债务危机。	Unlike the fiscal cliff, the structural deficit problem is not imminent: contrary to deficit hawks’ dire warnings, the US does not face a time-sensitive debt crisis.
更糟糕的是，奥巴马计划用导致伊斯兰国崛起的策略与伊斯兰国斗争：授权中央情报局在该地区几个 石油酋长的协助下训练和武装数千叙利亚叛军。	Making matters worse, Obama plans to use the same tactics to fight the Islamic State that led to its emergence: authorizing the CIA, aided by some of the region’s oil sheikhdoms, to train and arm thousands of Syrian rebels.
但债券市场不够大，吸收不了那么多流动性，因此其中一些流动性又回到了股市，股价出现了局部反弹，上证综指达到了3,500点。	But the bond market is not large enough to absorb it all, so some has now returned to the stock exchanges, leading to a partial recovery in share prices, with the Shanghai index reaching 3,500.
这一消息最早出现在一本新闻周刊上，然后被张贴在了互联网网站上，从电子邮件中被发送出去，又连续几天在卫星电视和电台中重复之后才发现了事实真相。	First published in a weekly news magazine, the story was then posted on Web sites, sent in e-mails, and repeated on satellite television and radio stations for days before the facts could be discovered.
中国面临巨大的内部挑战，如高企并仍在不断加剧的不平等性、严重的空气和水污染、向低碳经济转型的必要性以及令美国和欧洲也深受困扰金融市场动荡风险。	China faces huge internal challenges, including high and rising income inequality, massive air and water pollution, the need to move to a low-carbon economy, and the same risks of financial-market instabilities that bedevil the US and Europe.
在三中全会的决定之前，9月份在上海成立了自由贸易区，自贸区将向外国投资开放新部门，允许基本由市场决定的金融交易和资本流。	The Third Plenum’s decisions follow the launch in September of the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, which will open new sectors to foreign investment and permit largely market-based financial transactions and capital flows.
虽然特朗普很想告诉外界他凭借一己之力就可以管好美国，但事实是政府这家企业太过复杂，一个人无法管理和指挥。	As much as Trump may like to claim that he alone can fix the US, the truth is that government is too complex an enterprise for one person to manage and direct.
中国经济的这一特点，以及中国拥有的3.8万亿美元外汇储备和庞大（尽管正在下降）的经常项目盈余，让中国经济不必依赖外国储蓄和投资。	It helps that, with $3.8 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves and a large (though declining) current-account surplus, China’s economy does not depend on foreign saving and investment.
但英国人崇拜以“装死 ” （ keeping a stiff upper lip）来不变应万变的英雄。	But Britons admire a hero who can face adversity by doing nothing, while “keeping a stiff upper lip.”
当乌克兰为新一年对抗做好准备之际，世界各国应当明白有一个事实一点不能商量：我们的国家必须是完全独立的主权国。	As Ukraine prepares for another year of confrontation, the world should understand that one fact is non-negotiable: our country will be an independent, fully sovereign state.
其次，全球价值链使得低收入国家更难以利用其劳动力成本优势来抵消其技术劣势，因为它降低了它们使用其他生产性投入来替代低技能劳动力的能力。	Second, GVCs make it harder for low-income countries to use their labor-cost advantage to offset their technological disadvantage, by reducing their ability to substitute unskilled labor for other production inputs.
空中客车警告说 ， “ 无协议”的结果将迫使他们重新评估在英国的长期策略，数千个英国就业岗位将面临危险。	Airbus has warned that a “no deal” outcome would force it to reassess its long-term position in the country, putting thousands of British jobs at risk.
但是，即便政客和经济学家在为欧元辩护方面早已词穷，也没人干预挑战其基本结构，更不用说给出替代方案了。	But, even as politicians and economists run out of arguments in favor of the euro, few dare to challenge its fundamental structure, let alone propose alternatives.
联合利华许多品牌现在都有了相关的社会使命 — — 例如，多芬产品在营销的同时致力推动女性自尊运动，而Lifebuoy香皂则通过全球洗手计划应对传染病。	Many of its brands now have social missions – for example, Dove products are marketed with an accompanying women’s self-esteem campaign, and Lifebuoy soap targets communicable diseases through its global hand-washing programs.
但在过渡到另一个职业世界的过程中，我们可不能那么快就将机器人税排除在外，而是应该将其归入针对机器人革命所产生后果的更宏大应对方案中。	But let’s not rule out so quickly at least modest robot taxes during the transition to a different world of work. Such a tax should be part of a broader plan to manage the consequences of the robotics revolution.
不过，我还不能肯定人们对全球经济所面临的一些基本问题有足够的理解，没有这一点，目前的全球经济衰退是不太可能给强劲的经济增长让路的-无论美联储的工作做得有多么出色。	Still, I am not sure that there is sufficient appreciation of some of the underlying problems facing the global economy, without which the current global recession is unlikely to give way to robust growth – no matter how good a job the Fed does.
但西方民主中自由与秩序的结合 — — 西方献给世界的最珍贵礼物 — — 是漫长历史演变的产物，也是无法在短期内轻易复制的。	But Western democracies’ combination of freedom and order – the West’s most precious gift to the world – is the product of a long history that cannot be replicated in short order.
比如，IT行业的思科公司与非政府组织合作建立了社区之间的联系并帮助学生发展信息和通信技术方面的技能。	The IT company Cisco, for example, works with NGOs to connect communities and help students develop skills in information and communications technology.
但是，随着全球价值链（GVCS）的逐步普及，它们的方法已经过时了。 因此，我们最近和王直共同提出了一种新的计算实际有效汇率的方法，解决了目前的不足。	After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.
这名警官所描述的正是一种教科书式的“以种族相貌取人”的例子。 执法人员在决定是否叫停、搜查或拘留当事人时，依据的信息不是关于当事人行为的，而是套用了一种思维定势。	This police officer was describing a textbook example of “ethnic profiling”: law enforcement officials use of stereotypes, rather than specific information about behavior, in deciding to stop, search, or detain people.
口号和滚动播出的声音吸引着大部分目光，而更深层次的问题让6月23日的全民公决结果仍然高度不确定 — — 也许只需要一个事件就能最终左右结果。	While slogans and sound bites capture most of the attention, deeper issues in play leave the outcome of the June 23 referendum subject to a high degree of uncertainty – so much so that a single event could end up hijacking the decision.
今年年初，该国推出了一个随劳动者个人转移的“个人活动账户 ” ， 使得劳动者能够在多个工作岗位上获得受培训的权利，而不仅仅在特定职位或企业内累计这些权利。	Early this year, the country launched a portable “personal activity account,” which enables workers to accrue rights to training across multiple jobs, rather than accumulating such rights only within a specific position or company.
从长远看，拉丁美洲民主的发展不仅会使社会更加公正，经济更为繁荣，还能够扩大在医疗、教育和职业技能等领域的公共投入。	In the longer term, the spread of democracy in Latin America promises not only fairer societies, but also economically more dynamic societies, through increased public investments in health, education, and job skills.
由于欧洲的短视，土耳其实际上放弃了自己的入盟梦想并转而走上了一条寻求成为中东重要势力的准土耳其帝国之路 — — 而这也是一条反映出其利益和意识形态的政策。	Because of Europe’s short-sightedness, Turkey has in effect abandoned its ambitions for EU membership and opted for the neo-Ottoman project of becoming a Middle Eastern power – a policy shift that reflects both interests and ideology.
这让历史上的人们相信，是一些情趣高雅的高等生物创造了我们，我们定居在一个刻意设计的世界中，就像我们的抽象的超级马里奥。	It has led people throughout history to believe that some tasteful higher being created us, and that we inhabit a consciously designed world, like our notional Super Mario.
如果世界想要实现巴黎协定的气温目标、减缓变暖速度，那么每一种可能造成地球变暖的气体 — — 而不仅仅是二氧化碳 — — 都必须得到测量和适当的管理。	If the world is to meet the temperature targets of the Paris accord and slow the pace of warming, every gas responsible for a warmer planet – not just CO2 – must be measured and appropriately managed.
为此卢卡申科需要与白俄罗斯人谈一场新的“交易 ” ， 其中的内容也是他盘算好的：经济上的现代化与政治上的“稳定 ” 。	He needs to strike a new bargain with Belarusians, and he knows it: economic modernization with political “stability.”
伦敦—在伊斯兰国崛起的过程中，最令人心寒的也许是如此之多的西方国家公民加入其中，沦为人肉炸弹和断头人质。	LONDON – Among the most chilling developments in the rise of the Islamic State is that so many citizens of Western countries have joined the group’s ranks, becoming suicide bombers and beheading hostages.
但它们仍未经测试，由于其规模相对较小，无法让市场安心或为危机中的国家提供足够的紧急支持，尤其是在遭遇大规模系统性冲击的事件之中。	But they remain untested and, given their relatively small volumes, cannot reassure markets or provide adequate emergency support to crisis countries, especially in the event of large-scale systemic shocks.
二百五十家最大的私营和公营企业建立了一个组织，旨在和政府合作让它们第一次记述歧视性的雇用做法并加以矫正。	Two hundred and fifty of the largest private and public enterprises have created an organization aimed at working with the government to allow them, for the first time ever, to document, and then redress, their discriminatory employment practices.
但欧盟的风险尤其尖锐，因为民粹主义政治力量一旦赢得权力，就有可能打着国家主权的旗号拒绝构成欧洲机构基石的吵过架规则。	But the risk is particularly acute in the EU, because populist political forces, should they win power, are likely to reject, in the name of national sovereignty, the supranational rules that form the basis of European institutions.
相反，战后改革者相信，需要清除的乃是植根于帝国崇拜、武士道传统和极权“封建制度”等的具体的军国主义形式。	What needed to be purged instead, postwar reformers believed, was a specific form of Japanese militarism, rooted in emperor worship, the samurai tradition, authoritarian “feudalism,” and so on.
为了微观经济分析的精致性，行为科学的洞见重视不够 — — 甚至完全视而不见，结果它们变得很容易建立模型但缺乏现实性且过度简化。	And insights from behavioral science were inadequately regarded – if not shunned altogether – in favor of analytically elegant microeconomic underpinnings that were model-friendly, but unrealistic and overly simplistic.
因为所有27个成员国都必须批准该条约，因此显然它不可能被以现在的形式生效，同时“说是”的国家也不可能在不修改该条约的情况推动条约的批准。	Because all 27 states must ratify the Treaty, it therefore seems obvious that it cannot enter into force in its current form, and that the “yes” countries cannot push ahead with it unchanged.
此外，这意味着尼日利亚获得了比它所应该获得的更多的国际援助 — — 这些援助本可以用于更加需要的国家。	Moreover, it meant that Nigeria was allocated more international aid than it merited – aid that could have gone to needier countries.
阿拉伯联盟的立场是除非以色列停止在西岸及东耶路撒冷地区兴建定居点的行为，否则不会接受任何亲近会谈的提议。	The Arab position is that no proximity talks can be held until Israel freezes its settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
随着固定收益投资回报的下降，投资者被迫进军股市，拜金融和经济稳定的不确定性日益增加，股市变得越来越危险、越来越昂贵。	With returns on fixed-income investments decreasing, investors are being forced into equity investments, which have become riskier and more expensive, owing to increased uncertainty about financial and economic stability.
谁知到了 11 月，当伊朗政府认为自己已经通过街头暴力手段威吓住了人们的街头抗议之后，伊朗官员当即就放弃了妥协。	In November, when the government thought that street brutality had intimidated the protest movement, Iranian officials backed away from the compromise.
这项比喻赢得了压倒多数选民的认可，代表罗斯福的目标是以本质上不违反资本主义的创新方法来挽救疲弱的经济。	The metaphor, overwhelmingly endorsed by voters, stood for Roosevelt’s mandate to fix the ailing economy along lines that were innovative but still essentially capitalist.
如果能有更好的跨境交通基础设施和更灵活的医疗、金融和社会服务供给机制，香港退休公民的生活就可以突破香港的城市边界，而为年轻人腾出空间。	With better cross-border transport infrastructure and more flexible schemes for delivering medical, financial, and social services, senior citizens could retire outside of Hong Kong’s city limits, creating space for younger workers.
根据世界银行最近一项研究，分布式可再生能源“将是非洲少数家庭成本最低的选择，即使有可能考虑在未来20年削减成本 。 ”	According to a recent World Bank study, distributed renewable energy “will be the lowest cost option for a minority of households in Africa, even when likely cost reductions over the next 20 years are considered.”
从本质上来说，贸易流量取决于寿命长度，那些预计将来会出现相对较多老年人口的国家应该现在实行贸易盈余，以后实施贸易赤字。	Trade flows may be driven substantially by longevity: countries expecting a relatively large number of elderly in the future should be running trade surpluses now and deficits later.
与此同时，昂山素季未能行使任何道德权威，她坚持认为“虚假消息的巨型冰山”正在“保护恐怖分子利益”的观点就像军方的辩护律师。	Suu Kyi, meanwhile, has failed to exercise any moral authority, sounding instead like an apologist when she insists that “a huge iceberg of misinformation” is “promoting the interest of the terrorists.”
结果，在发达经济体高流动性、低收益率时期流向新兴市场的资本目前正在逃离许多热钱导致财政、货币和信用政策过度宽松的国家。	As a result, the capital that flowed to emerging markets in the years of high liquidity and low yields in advanced economies is now fleeing many countries where easy money caused fiscal, monetary, and credit policies to become too lax.
事实上，诚然各部门总是试图捍卫自己的地盘，在大问题上毫无疑问存在着互相掣肘，但在中国改写世界经济秩序的努力中，它们一直是精诚合作的。	Indeed, although ministries, seeking to protect their own turf, undoubtedly impede one another on major issues, they have been collaborating wholeheartedly in China’s effort to reshape the world economic order.
被称为“亚洲四小龙”的香港，台湾，新加坡和韩国都在教育上倾注了极大的投资，而回报它们的则是一支有能力且现代化的劳动力大军。	The East Asian tigers invested heavily in education, and it paid off in terms of a capable and modern workforce.
他们只要花点钱按一个水泵就万事大吉 — — 他们很乐意这样做，结果是如今水泵数量增加到了2,300万个。	They had to invest only in installing the actual pumps – and they did so willingly, resulting in a total of 23 million water pumps today.
商业和可持续发展委员会（BSDC）的报告指出，投资于SDG能带来巨大的回报，包括新机会、巨大的效率改善、创新推动力、名声改善等。	The Business and Sustainable Development Commission (BSDC) has reported that investments in the SDGs bring enormous returns, including new opportunities, massive efficiency gains, impetus for innovation, and improved reputations.
即使在两国政府仍然无法达成一致的问题上 — — 比如多哈回合贸易谈判和气候变化解决方案 — — 开展全新创造性合作的潜力也远远超过了他们之间的分歧。	Even where the two governments continue to disagree – for example, on the Doha round of trade negotiations and on the solution to climate change – the potential for new and creative cooperation outweighs their differences.
唯有联合的国际战略 — — 其中复活的TPP是必不可少的一部分 — — 有希望迫使中国领导人按规则行事。	Only a concerted international strategy, with a revived TPP an essential component, stands a chance of compelling China’s leaders to play by the rules.
2009年4月在伦敦召开的最成功的G-20峰会媒体报导所广泛采用的官方照片准确捕捉到了全球经济体制变化的崭新氛围。	The new mood of global economic regime change was captured in the official photograph that was widely used in coverage of the most successful of the G-20 summits, held in London in April 2009.
有一条原则的确还是对的：当失业率威胁上升的时候，央行应该试图通过促进资产价格上升来保持经济基本实现充分就业。	One principle does remain true: central banks should try to keep the economy at near full employment by pushing asset prices up when unemployment threatens to rise.
政府已经采取了一些积极措施：比如北京周边地区的空气质量在今年冬天大幅改善，这要归功于关闭污染企业并用天然气代替煤炭供暖。	The government has taken some positive steps: the air quality around Beijing, for example, has improved considerably this winter, thanks to efforts to shut down polluting factories and replace coal with natural gas for household heating.
这种观念上的差异在社会众多领域显而易见，尤其是在英美两国医院，掌握大量知识的执业医生与管理者分开工作。	This difference in attitude is evident in many areas of society, not least in hospitals in the United States and the United Kingdom, where knowledge-intensive medical practitioners operate separately from managers.
直到生命的最后一天都身穿军装的阿布•阿马尔（阿拉法特的革命化名）不认为在以色列占领仍然继续的时候自己应该以平民总统的姿态出现。	Dressed in his military suit until his last day, Abu Ammar (Arafat’s revolutionary nom de guerre) did not believe that it was time to become a civilian president while the Israeli occupation continued.
他在2005—2012年担任埃塞俄比亚卫生部长期间着力推进所有埃塞俄比亚人民的利益，强化了该国的基本医疗。	As Ethiopia’s health minister from 2005 to 2012, he championed the interests of all of the country’s citizens, and strengthened primary-care services.
但就业仍然萎靡不振，这主要是拜劳动力节约技术和全球供应链重构（低附加值细分市场和功能倾向于向低收入国家集中）等长期因素所致。	And yet employment still lags, owing to longer-term factors like labor-saving technology and reconfigurations of global supply chains, in which lower-value-added segments and functions tend to be concentrated in lower-income countries.
事实上，政府债务和国内生产总值的比例约为20 ％ ， 而美国为80 ％以上， 日本为160 ％ ， 欧洲则是60-90 ％ 。	Indeed, the government debt-to-GDP ratio is about 20%, compared with more than 80% in the United States, 160% in Japan, and 60-90% in Europe.
如果我们削减援助额，我们将会失信，而贫国将再一次了解到富国的那些激动人心的减少世界贫困的华丽的辞藻不会全部付诸实践。	If we cut back on aid, we will fail to keep our promise, and poorer countries will learn, once again, that rich countries’ actions fall short of their inspiring rhetoric about reducing world poverty.
经济模型表明成功的多哈回合谈判将使全球经济到2030年每年增加11万亿美元财富，其中多数收益将流向发展中国家。	Economic models indicate that a successful Doha round would make the global economy $11 trillion richer each year by 2030, with most of the benefits going to developing countries.
如果日本银行停止购买政府债券，就像引发一场主权危机并导致自身投资组合的价值受损（尤其当它开始出售自身资产负债表上的债券时 ） 。	If it stopped buying government debt, it could trigger a sovereign crisis and reduce the value of its own portfolio (especially if it started selling the bonds on its balance sheet).
是的，在美国仍然存在一场金融危机，但是高涨的通货膨胀仅仅是一种令人难以置信的不公平且无效的解决方式。	Yes, there is still a financial crisis in the US, but stoking inflation is an incredibly unfair and inefficient way to deal with it.
好消息是打击疟疾的斗争最近有所进展，疟疾传染情况在大部分地区稳步下降，疟疾相关死亡数量也自2010年以来下降了29 % 。	The good news is that the fight against malaria has lately gained momentum, with infections falling steadily in most places and malaria-related deaths down by 29% since 2010.
发自纽约 — — 如今发行代币（Initial Coin Offering，简称ICO）已经成为了加密货币企业的最常见融资手段，眼下已经有近1600个这类项目且增势不减。	NEW YORK – Initial coin offerings have become the most common way to finance cryptocurrency ventures, of which there are now nearly 1,600 and rising.
收入差距从后者的超过七比一，西班牙和摩洛哥之间的4.5比1，美国和墨西哥之间的4.3比1一直到希腊和阿尔巴尼亚之间的四比一。	The income gaps range from more than seven to one in the latter case to 4.5 to one in the case of Spain and Morocco, 4.3 to one between the US and Mexico, and four to one between Greece and Albania.
即将离任的美洲人权委员会言论自由专员卡特琳娜·波特罗表示 ， “ 厄瓜多尔和古巴两国对言论自由的限制最为严重 。 ”	According to Catalina Botero, the outgoing rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, “Ecuador is, along with Cuba, the country that most restricts freedom of expression.”
或者他可以发布更多关于伊斯兰教邪恶性的煽动性推文，从而将受到骚扰和边缘化的个人驱入伊斯兰国或其他极端主义团体的怀抱。	Or he could post further inflammatory tweets about the evils of Islam, thereby driving disturbed and marginalized individuals into the arms of the Islamic State (ISIS) or other extremist groups.
事实上，尽管欧洲人民党赢得了29%的席位，而社会党和民主党进步联盟（Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats，简称S&D）只获得了24 % ， 但后者仍可以宣布获胜。	In fact, though the EPP won 29% of the seats, versus 24% for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the S&D can claim victory.
不出四年，美国总统富兰克林·罗斯福的新当选政府通过了格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案（Glass-Steagall Act ） ， 禁止商业银行用客户的存款交易证券。	Less than four years later, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s newly elected government passed the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from trading securities with clients’ deposits.
我在我的书《欧洲之春 》 （ European Spring）中指出，一个有缺陷的、技术官僚的欧盟需要果断的领导人、政治企业家、草根运动和更多的协商式民主（deliberative democracy）实验来实现改变。	In my book European Spring, I argue that a flawed, technocratic EU needs bold leaders, political entrepreneurs, grassroots movements, and more experiments with deliberative democracy to deliver change. Macron has proposed all four.
在美国，2000年高科技泡沫的破裂导致市值缩水4万亿美元，但当时美国股市的破灭并没有导致系统性经济危机。	In the US, the collapse of the tech bubble in 2000 entailed a $4 trillion loss in market capitalization. But the US managed to avoid a systemic crisis.
但美国向台湾军售成为缓和紧张局势的一个主要的障碍，此次军售包括30架阿帕奇战斗机和330枚爱国者导弹，总价高达65亿美元。	But there is a major obstacle to easing tensions: the proposed $6.5 billion sale by the United States to Taiwan of 30 Apache attack helicopters and 330 Patriot missiles.
对很多经济自由派和传统保守派而言，这些“税收竞赛”是一件好事，因为他们认为降低税收能够解放市场力量，从而推动创新和增长。	To many economic liberals and traditional conservatives, such “tax competition” is a good thing, because it is assumed that lower taxes will unleash market forces, thereby fueling innovation and growth.
在未来几十年，人口构成变化，气候变化和人员流动将使得病原体更容易传播，从而令抗生素耐药性状况进一步恶化。	Over the coming decades, demographic shifts, climate change, and human migration, will compound AMR by making it easier for pathogens to spread.
十七项SDG包括了169个具体的小目标（target ） ， 它们构成了一个宏大的日程，意在解决从性别平等到可持续城市和气候变化在内的所有问题。	The 17 SDGs, which include 169 individual targets, constitute an ambitious agenda to address everything from gender equity to sustainable cities and climate change.
但归根结底，互联网构成了重大的治理挑战，这既体现在努力理解流动性无所不在的影响，也体现在“大数据”的存储和搜集。	Ultimately, however, the Internet poses a major governance challenge, exemplified in ongoing efforts to understand the implications of ubiquitous mobility and the collection and storage of “big data.”
如今，我们知道儿童肥胖已是很多国家的一个普遍问题，2型糖尿病和冠心病的高发也是一个令人警惕的信号，会对子孙后代的预期寿命带来巨大的消极影响。	What is known so far is that childhood obesity has become an epidemic in many countries, with an alarming rise in rates of type 2 diabetes and coronary disease implying a significant negative impact on life expectancy in future generations.
尽管我个人的猜测是美联储将在3月提高利率，但什么时候开始并不重要，重要的是提高利率的节奏，以及2015年年底时的利率水平。	Although my own best guess is that the Fed will start to raise rates in March, the starting date is less important than the pace of the rate increase and where the rate will be by the end of 2015.
定期碰头对节目进行评估的部门领导和审片委员会很少指定节目的内容。 他们仅仅是将发现的问题和建议下达给节目编导。	The department heads and oversight committees that meet to evaluate programming seldom dictate content, but merely pass their complaints and recommendations down to programming heads.
显而易见，没有任何措施能保护新奥尔良彻底免受卡特里娜飓风的影响，但飓风所造成的破坏却肯定能够得以减轻。	Clearly, nothing could have spared New Orleans completely from Katrina’s impact, but the devastation could certainly have been lessened.
在气候变化方面，寻求“迷你协定”制定最低限度的标准提高能源效率、减缓森林采伐和限制最大经济体的碳排放更有意义。	On climate change, it makes sense to seek “mini-agreements” that set minimum common standards for fuel efficiency, slow deforestation, or limit the largest economies’ carbon output.
而被评为非投资级的公司和小公司，其融资通常是靠银行贷款而不是资本市场，它们仍然面临严峻的信贷枯竭形势。	And the credit crunch for non-investment-grade firms and smaller firms, which rely mostly on access to bank loans rather than capital markets, is still severe.
正如前美联储主席伯南克在2011年的一次讲话中所指出的 ， “ 如果我们能够更有效地测量创新行为、了解它们在经济增长中的作用，我们就更能促进这类行为 。 ”	As former US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke noted in a 2011 speech, “We will be more likely to promote innovative activity if we are able to measure it more effectively and document its role in economic growth.”
在我们药到病除的愿望驱使下，制药业充分发挥其巨大能量，将“症”和“病”的概念引入了我们生活的方方面面。	The pharmaceutical industry, fueled by our desire for quick fixes, has effectively deployed its considerable power to promulgate the notion of “disorders” and “illnesses” in all domains of our lives.
法国年轻工人们感到困惑，如果全球化意味着接受更低的工资和更弱的工作保证，它又如何让他们生活更好呢？ 他们提出的这一问题无法再回避了。	The questions posed by young French workers, who wonder how globalization will make them better off if it means accepting lower wages and weaker job protection, can no longer be ignored.
尽管特朗普不惜重金意在使性伴侣保持沉默，比如成人电影明星兼脱衣舞女斯托米·丹尼尔斯，但特朗普的婚外情依旧人尽皆知。	Trump’s extramarital affairs are common knowledge, despite hefty pay-offs intended to silence his sexual partners, such as the adult film performer and stripper known as Stormy Daniels.
被获准驻扎在巴基斯坦北部北瓦济里斯坦的部落机构庇护所的贾拉鲁丁·哈卡尼部落是巴基斯坦政府打算用来维护其在阿富汗利益的盟友。	The Jalaluddin Haqqani group, which was allowed to base itself in a sanctuary in Pakistan’s North Waziristan tribal agency, was one such ally that Pakistan’s government thought could be used to further its interests in Afghanistan.
欧盟应该考虑从长期目标，如建立地中海共同市场促进北非经济体增长，最终将该地区转变为移民目的地而不是转运区。	The EU should consider longer-term goals, like creating a common Mediterranean market to allow North African economies to grow, eventually transforming the region into a destination for migrants rather than a transit zone.
维也纳—土耳其执政党正义与发展党（Justice and Development Party，AKP）在最近的议会大选中没能保住多数席位，这让土耳其滑向了陌生的政治领域。	VIENNA – Turkey is moving into unchartered political territory, following the failure of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to retain its parliamentary majority in the country’s recent general election.
特别是美国，劳动力捍卫自己占国民收入中的比例的能力，以及中低收入家庭捍卫自己在工资总量中的比例的能力都大幅下降。	In the US, in particular, the ability of labor to protect its share of national income, and of lower- and middle-income households to protect their share of the wage pool, eroded substantially.
根据宾大全球图表的数据，1950年时有2/3的国家人均实际GDP高于或低于全球平均水平至少45 % ， 差距幅度可以高达225 ％ 。	According to the PWT data, two-thirds of all countries in 1950 had real per capita GDP veering above or below the global average by at least 45%, and by as much as 225%.
工会在智识上的受尊敬程度与其政治影响力一样在复苏。 几十年来，经济学家们诽谤说工会增加了失业并限制增长。	Along with their political clout, unions’ intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance.
在这种崭新的社会关系当中，买什么，何时买和从谁处买都任由消费者自由选择，还常常能跟卖家讨价还价一番。	In this novel social relationship, the customer was free to buy whatever he wanted, whenever and from whomever he chose, often bargaining with the seller about the price.
我们现在知道只需一次简单的基因类型测定即可了解干扰素对特定患者的疗效，而那些疗效不佳的患者可以服用很多正在研制的新药。	We now know that a simple genotype sorts out who will or will not benefit from interferon, and there are many new drugs in development for those who will not.
特朗普最初承诺要将美国大使馆迁往耶路撒冷，并支持以色列在西岸地区兴建定居点在美国的阿拉伯盟友看来是尤其值得警惕的。	Trump’s early pledge to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, and his support for Israeli settlements in the West Bank, was particularly alarming to America’s Arab allies.
2012年—2013年，生产一辆汽车所需要的原材料价值上升到2,000美元左右，约占同一辆汽车的10 % （ 汽车单价丈涨幅要小得多 ） 。	By 2012-2013, the value of the raw materials needed for a car increased to about $2,000, about 10% of the cost of the same car (prices of cars had increased by much less).
最显而易见的含义是，方济各对极化十分厌倦，希望两人同时封圣有助于促进“大一统”的天主教，吸引更广泛的教众。	The most obvious implication is that Francis is weary of polarization, and hopes that the dual canonization will help to propel a shift toward a “big tent” Catholicism that appeals to a broader range of people.
欧洲央行正在二级市场暗地里买进各国政府债券，但它的新行长马里奥·德拉吉却坚称这种介入行为只是暂时，有限且仅仅是为了“修复货币流动渠道的功能 ” 。	The ECB is stealthily buying government bonds on the secondary market, but its new governor, Mario Draghi, insists that such intervention is temporary, limited, and intended solely to “restore the functioning of monetary transmission channels.”
墨尔本—1809年，功利主义（utilitarianism）创始人边沁开始写作《谬误集 》 （ The Book of Fallacies ） 。	MELBOURNE – In 1809, Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, set to work on The Book of Fallacies.
总体经济增长大约为工作时长（劳动者数量或者工作小时数的增长）以及生产力（每小时劳动的产出）增长的总和。	Total economic growth amounts to roughly the sum of the growth of work hours (an increase in the number of workers or the amount of hours that they work) and productivity (output per hour of work).
那时，已经有不容忽视的证据表明一个急需解决的严重问题的存在，而自那以后的数据—如与两极的冰盖快速消融相关的数据—更是强化了这一结论。 约有近1/4的温室气体排放产生于土地使用的改变，其中又以采伐森林为主。	At the time, there was already overwhelming evidence of a serious problem that needed to be addressed, and data since then ­­– concerning, for example, the rapid melting of the polar ice cap – have strongly reinforced this conclusion.
同一年，在也门（逊尼派占多数的国家 ） ， 沙特领导的联军与栽德派什叶派胡塞叛军作战。 伊朗为了控制也门、获得在阿拉伯半岛的立足点而为胡塞叛军提供武装。	This year in Yemen (a predominantly Sunni country), a Saudi-led coalition is fighting the Zaydi Shia Houthi rebels, whom Iran armed in order to take over the country and gain a foothold on the Arabian Peninsula.
莫斯科—去年八月发生在格鲁吉亚的危机考验了欧洲的安全体系，该体系没有能够完成其确保欧洲大陆共同安全的核心任务。	MOSCOW – The crisis in Georgia last August tested Europe’s security system, and the system failed to fulfill its core task of ensuring common security for the continent as a whole.
日本执政党和最大反对党均支持该协定，奥巴马邀请中国加入的举动表明美国在可行的时候也在试图打造地区共识。	Japan’s ruling party and leading opposition party are coming around to support the idea, and Obama’s invitation to China to join suggests that the US is trying to forge regional consensus where it can.
多德－弗兰克金融改革创建了消费者金融保护局，从而使非公开发行的金融产品能更好地为公众服务，同时也创造出在公开市场交易衍生品的激励机制。	The Dodd-Frank financial reforms created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, so that privately issued financial products would serve the public better, and created incentives for derivatives to be traded on public markets.
德拉吉的干预（或者说德国总理默克尔、法国总统奥朗德和意大利总理蒙蒂给他的公众支持）能产生多久的效果还未可知。	It remains unclear how long-lasting the effects of Draghi’s intervention – or of the public support offered to him by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, and Italian premier Mario Monti – will prove to be.
那些支持收紧政策的人也会注意到对于储蓄者，保险公司和养老基金来说低利率是有问题的，因为它们投资组合中的股票比例通常较低。	Those in favor of a policy tightening would also note that low rates are problematic for savers, insurance companies, and pension funds, whose portfolios often include few equities.
如果真是这样的话，药物引发的死亡数量将在引发死亡原因中（根据使用不同的死亡率估算法）排名第四或第五。	If true, drug-induced death would qualify as the fourth or fifth leading cause of death (depending on which mortality estimates are used).
在棉兰老岛（Mindanao ） ， 日本建立了一个女性职业培训中心，让纺织机的旋转的运转声取代了枪声和愤怒的哭喊声。	In Mindanao, where Japan built a vocational training center for women, the sounds of gunshots and angry cries have been replaced by the whir of sewing machines.
雄蚊不会咬人，因此释放它们不会造成健康风险，而由于它们不会有子孙后代，大自然中也不会有转基因蚊子出现。	Male mosquitoes do not bite, so their release presents no health risk, and, because their progeny die, no genetically engineered mosquitoes persist in the environment.
我们有理由相信商品繁荣对拉美贸易条件的积极影响将长期持续 — — 也许10－15年 — — 但却不会永远持续下去。	It is reasonable to presume that the commodity boom’s positive effect on Latin America’s terms of trade will last for an extended period – perhaps 10-15 years – but that it will not be permanent.
他在网上公布的一次采访中对自己的女儿说 ： “ [克劳利]当时应该对我说 ， ‘ 对不起，先生，祝您好运。	As he put it to his daughter in an interview published online: “[Crowley] should have gotten out of there and said, ‘I’m sorry, sir, good luck.
果真如此的话，只要中国执政者继续强化社会安全网，储蓄的下降就能匹配设想中的投资下降，保持较低水平的经常项目盈余。	In that case, as long as China’s rulers continue to strengthen social safety nets, the decline in saving could match the envisaged decline in investment, keeping the current-account surplus low.
但如果贸易赤字收窄是因为家庭增加储蓄和政府赤字减少，那么有投资有可能会提高 — — 从而提高长期收入。	But if the trade deficit narrows because households save more and government deficits are reduced, it is possible to have a higher level of investment – and thus higher incomes in the long term.
技术进步显然有利于促进增长，但20世纪90年代以来的金融崛起可能具有消极效应 — — 通过金融危机和债务积累突显。	While technological progress clearly fosters growth, the rise of finance since the 1990s has probably had an adverse effect, via financial crises and the accumulation of debt.
哈梅内伊在升任伊朗最高政治和宗教领袖之前曾经担任过总统，因此，很容易看出，如果保守派候选人莱西当选，就很有可能成为哈梅内伊的继承人。	With Khamenei having served as president before rising to Iran’s highest political and religious leadership position, it is easy to see that the conservative candidate Raisi, had he been elected, could have become Khamenei’s successor.
与此同时，由希腊非盈利组织莫里亚国际紧急响应中心（Emergency Response Center International in Moria）天天都会遇到自残的情况，自杀也屡见不鲜。	In the meantime, a small clinic run by the Greek nonprofit Emergency Response Center International in Moria confronts cases of self-harm daily, and suicide is not uncommon.
与此同时，中国 — — 世界领先的可再生能源项目投资者 — — 正在经历从世界低成本工厂向全球绿��创新领袖兼清洁技术主要出口者的转型。	Meanwhile, China – the world’s leading investor in renewable-energy projects – is undergoing a transformation from the world’s low-cost factory to a global leader in green innovation and a major exporter of clean technologies.
简言之，和其他几种SDR篮子中的货币不同，人民币还在成为国际货币的路上，正如中国还在成为经济和金融大国的路上。	In short, unlike the rest of the currencies in the SDR basket, the renminbi is an international currency in the making, just as China is an economic and financial power in the making.
更令人不安的是利比亚暴力事件揭示了中东地区的某些特点，这些特点在突尼斯和开罗令人兴奋的成功之后被忘得一干二净。	More troubling still is that Libya’s violence reveals certain features of the Middle East that had been forgotten after the heady success in Tunis and Cairo.
如果普京党只是引诱普通的欧洲民粹主义煽动家，如英国的法拉奇（Nigel Farage）和匈牙利的奥班（Viktor Órban ） ， 便已经够坏的了。	If Putin’s Party were enticing only the usual European populist demagogues, from Nigel Farage in the United Kingdom to Viktor Órban in Hungary, it would be bad enough.
在洪水方面，IPCC更是直言不讳。 它说，从全球层面看 ， “ 没有信心”认为气候变化引起洪水变多还是变少。	On flooding, the IPCC is even blunter: It has “low confidence” at a global level whether climate change has caused more or less flooding.
此外，高存款贮备金率和强制购买央行票据严重积压了商业银行的利润空间 — — 该情况在利率管制放松之后还将进一步恶化。	Furthermore, the high reserve ratio and forced purchase of central-bank bills squeezes commercial banks’ profits severely – a phenomenon that will be intensified by interest-rate liberalization.
在这些快速变化中还需建立一个精心设计且覆盖全面的社会安全网 — — 包括失业保险和公共医疗保险 — — 以保护弱势劳动者。	Well-designed and comprehensive social safety nets – including, for example, unemployment insurance and public health insurance – will also be needed to protect vulnerable workers amid rapid change.
如果 — — 现在看起来颇有可能 — — 特朗普的私人利益不能与公共责任充分剥离，共和党的不满有可能加剧，这将让特朗普陷入难堪。	Republicans’ disaffection could be enhanced if – as now appears likely – Trump’s private interests are not sufficiently disentangled from his public responsibilities, making him something of an embarrassment.
另一个选择是激活欧洲央行的“直接货币交易 ” （ OMT）计划，即欧洲央行在二级市场购买欧元区成员国的债券。	An alternative option would be to activate the European Central Bank’s “outright monetary transactions” program, in which the ECB would purchase eurozone member states’ bonds in secondary markets.
我也知道，在今天的赢家的热诚中，在他的喜悦中，在他的年轻的乐观主义中（这种乐观同时是克制的、强烈的、说教的 ） ， 有一些应对法国文明的弊病的东西。	And I know that there is, in the enthusiasm of today’s winner, in his joy, in his youthful optimism (an optimism at once measured, fervent, and didactic), something that responds to the malaise of French civilization.
西方援助计划固有的缺陷所造成的空白已经在巴基斯坦等地催生了本土化的解决方案，在上述地区，有社会责任感和企业家精神的宗教领袖毛拉正在发挥越来越重要的作用。	The void created by the shortcomings of Western aid programs has produced homegrown solutions in places like Pakistan, where socially minded, entrepreneurial religious leaders – mullahs – are increasingly making their presence felt.
类似的二分法也适用于其他许多关键问题，包括适应气候变化、改善资源管理的措施、城市化和大都市的兴起、劳动力流动性的增加和人力资本扩张等。	A similar dichotomy applies to many other critical issues, including adaptation to climate change, efforts to improve resource management, urbanization and the rise of megacities, increased labor mobility, and human-capital expansion.
他们回答说他们以前曾经采取过这样的行动，但是没有得到响应。 他们还提醒我说哈马斯此前曾坚持在包括加沙和西岸的整个巴勒斯坦地区实现停火，但是被以色列拒绝了。	They responded that such previous action by them had not been reciprocated, and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine including both Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel had refused.
本质上，这是知识压力测试 — — 迫使中国领导人在严格而理性的外部专家面前为其新制定的战略和政策辩护。	It is, in essence, an intellectual stress test – forcing Chinese leaders to defend newly formulated strategies and policies before a tough and seasoned audience of outside experts.
福娄拜对《唐吉诃德》的评论也许最能解释这个原因 ： “ 我在这本书中找到了自己的根源，这种根源是我在识字以前就已经用心感受到 。 ”	The simplest explanation for this may be found in Flaubert’s words about Don Quixote : “I found my origins in this book, which I knew by heart before I learned how to read.”
但事实却恰恰相反，这一幕仅仅再次表明在俄罗斯没有真正的“二号人物 ” ， 只有普京一个人控制着联邦安全局、法院和经济领域的最高指挥权。	Instead, the episode has merely shown, yet again, that there is no real “number two” in Russia; there is only Putin, controlling the FSB, the courts, and the commanding heights of the economy.
放大这条妙计的是普京愤怒的呼声 — — 俄罗斯不会允许斯诺登滞留国内，除非他停滞泄漏“旨在伤害我们的美国伙伴”的情报。	This coup de théȃtre was magnified by Putin’s cynical claim that Russia would allow Snowden to stay only if he stopped leaking information “aimed at inflicting damage on our American partners.”
这不仅因为其与1965年后的3.8％增长趋势大同小异，还由于2017~18年的预期增长是在经历了大萧条后异常疲软的复苏之后发生的。	Not only is it little different from the post-1965 trend of 3.8% growth, but the expected gains over 2017-2018 follow an exceptionally weak recovery in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
正如特朗普的“重商”立场可以提升信心，甚至有时会乐观过度，那种认为某位领导者持有“轻商”立场的看法也会导致信心下降。	Just as a “pro-business” stance like Trump’s can boost confidence, perhaps even excessively, the perception that a leader is “anti-business” can cause confidence to fall.
唐纳德·特朗普的英国密友、前英国独立党领导人尼格尔·法拉奇（Nigel Farage）建议特朗普把这尊铜像迎回椭圆办公室。	Donald Trump’s British crony, Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, suggested that Trump should put the bronze bust back in the Oval Office.
华盛顿—身为希拉里·克林顿，全世界最著名的女性之一、美国政坛地位最高的人物之一、有可能的下任美国总统，可谓苦恼重重。	WASHINGTON, DC – Being Hillary Clinton, one of the most celebrated women in the world, holder of some of the highest offices in American politics, and possibly the next president of the United States, has had more than its share of agony.
中国起领导作用的很多环保主义者都曾是1989年天安门事件中的学生和知识份子领袖，他们都深信：环境行动主义可以为更为广泛的政治改革开辟道路。	Many of China’s leading environmentalists are former students and intellectual leaders from the Tiananmen protests of 1989 who believe that environmental activism offers an avenue for advancing broader political reform.
很显然，为了充实达尔文主义，我们必须明白达尔文主义中处于核心地位的三个过程：我们要知道生物是怎样发展和繁衍的，什么被遗传以及是怎样遗传的，以及遗传变异是怎样发生的。	To flesh out Darwinism, we obviously have to understand the three processes that are at its core. We need to know how organisms develop and reproduce, what is inherited and how it is inherited, and how heritable variations are generated.
后冷战时代世界的规则正在改变，但并不是符合俄国的最终利益。 俄国低估了其行动会让西方团结一致的效果。	The rules of the post-Cold War world are changing – but not to the ultimate benefit of Russia, which has underestimated the unifying effect its actions will have on the West.
以卢旺达为例。 卢旺达可谓成功的先驱，自1995年以来其GDP平均年增长率高达令人诧异的9.6 % （ 人均收入增长年率为5.2 % ） 。	Consider Rwanda, a much-heralded success story where GDP has increased by a whopping 9.6% per year, on average, since 1995 (with per capita incomes rising at an annual rate of 5.2%).
关于方济各的奇闻异事听起来煞有介事 — — 比如他常常把自己的电话给那些遭难的人们，以及他决定为罪犯、穆斯林和女性洗脚（这令一些教会人士大惊失色 ） 。	Anecdotes about Francis – from his propensity for making personal phone calls to those in distress to his decision to wash the feet of criminals, Muslims, and women (to the horror of some churchmen) – ring true.
墨西哥城—要知道普通美国人对美国和墨西哥关系的看法，看看热播剧《绝命毒师 》 （ Breaking Bad）就好了。	MEXICO CITY – For a glimpse of the average American’s understanding of the relationship between the United States and Mexico, one only has to watch the critically acclaimed television series Breaking Bad.
加泰罗尼亚为机是一次强烈的历史暗示，表明欧洲需要制定新的主权类型，这种主权类型强化城市和地区，淡化国家忠诚，坚持民主规范。	The Catalonia crisis is a strong hint from history that Europe needs to develop a new type of sovereignty, one that strengthens cities and regions, dissolves national particularism, and upholds democratic norms.
既然曾经成功推翻了前总统胡斯尼·穆巴拉克（Hosni Mubarak）并把国家武装力量送回兵营，很多人都随时准备再次走上街头去让领导人承担罪责。	Empowered by their success in ousting former President Hosni Mubarak, and then sending the country’s armed forces back to the barracks, many are readily returning to the streets to hold leaders accountable.
这笔资金能够支持实现被写入巴基斯坦宪法的承诺 — — 巴基斯坦将“在尽可能短的时间内实现免费中学义务教育 ” — —的必要措施。	Such funding will support the steps needed to fulfill the promise, contained in our country’s constitution, that the state will “provide free and compulsory secondary education within minimum possible period.”
当威尔逊在1976年突然辞职，把唐宁街10号交给已故的卡宁汉时，人们开始怀疑：他是否被与南非有牵连的特工密谋所赶下台呢？	When Prime Minister Harold Wilson suddenly resigned in 1976 and left No. 10 Downing Street to the late James Callaghan, people became suspicious: had he been forced out by some secret service plot concerning South Africa?
没错，埃及曾经催生了激进的穆斯林兄弟会，但它也同样是伊斯兰社会主义和反殖民主义、阿拉伯团结的发源地，而今又以民主的方式肯定了人民的意志。	True, it once spawned the radical Muslim Brotherhood, but it also gave birth to Islamic socialism and anti-colonialism, Arab unity, and now a democratic affirmation of the people’s will.
然而，过去一个世纪以来的趋势是小国家的数量不断增多，这主要是由于针对多民族帝国的民族主义反抗的发生：最近一次大规模的建国潮出现在前苏联解体之后。	Yet the trend over the past century has been towards a continuous increase in the number of small states, mainly owing to nationalist revolts against multi-national empires: the latest bout of state creation followed the disintegration of the USSR.
小微企业需要的是新资本以创造就业、做大经济蛋糕；而与经济活动关联的银行账户能确保即使是路边小贩也能从经济蛋糕中分得一块。	What small businesses and micro-enterprises need is fresh capital to create employment and expand the economic pie, and bank accounts connected to economic activity ensure that even those selling goods by the roadside can secure a piece of that pie.
如果全球经济曾经有过一个公平的竞技场，那它已经不再存在了：美国所提供的巨额补贴和紧急援助已经改变了一切，而且这种改变也许是不可逆转的。	If there was ever a level playing field in the global economy, it no longer exists: the massive subsidies and bailouts provided by the US have changed everything, perhaps irreversibly.
但是，Nathalie Rykiel -或法国、意大利、美国富裕的精英们-有多少可能认同这些价值观呢？	But what are the chances of Nathalie Rykiel – or the affluent elites of France, or Italy, or the United States – adopting those values?
传统科学还原论者专注于“自下而上”机制，不足以理解自上而下和循环的因果关系，也不能理解嵌套过程的世界。	Traditional reductionist views of science, with their focus on “bottom-up” mechanisms, do not suffice in the quest to understand top-down and circular causality and a world of nested processes.
母亲们为这场古老的斗争注入了直接、个人和情感的因素，坚持要求她们子女作为公民和人类的权利和存在必须得到保护。	Mothers bring a direct, emotional, and personal component to this age-old struggle, insisting on their children’s existence as citizens and human beings whose rights must be upheld.
诚然，世界总会有一定程度的不平等性存在；事实上，和失业一样，有限程度的不平等是值得追求的，它可以推动竞争和增长。	To be sure, there will always be a certain amount of inequality in the world; in fact, as with unemployment, a limited amount is desirable as a driver of competition and growth.
1973年，在多数新闻媒体都放弃报道这一事件后 ， 《 华盛顿邮报》卡尔·伯恩斯坦和鲍勃·伍德沃德的顽强报道维系了水门事件的活跃度。	In 1973, dogged reporting by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward of the Washington Post kept the Watergate story alive, after most news outlets had dropped it.
随着暴力犯罪令人震惊地大幅度增加，随着骇人听闻的强奸和虐待儿童罪行变得日益恶化，如今恢复死刑的呼声常常充盈于耳，而且得到了公众的广泛支持。	With violent crimes on a shocking upsurge, with the hideous crimes of child rape and abuse on the increase, there are nowadays frequent calls – backed by wide public support – to restore capital punishment.
但是二十世纪的最后十年还是由于前南斯拉夫以及卢旺达的种族灭绝而蒙垢。 在现今的十年中，潮流好像逆转对人权事业不利。	But the last decade of the twentieth century was also indelibly stained by ethnic cleansing in ex-Yugoslavia and genocide in Rwanda, and during the current decade the tide has seemed to turn against the rights cause.
事实上，美国追求的是一个主导亚洲的战略，而不是平等关系，这与中国内部的紧张因素一道削弱了中国积极参与区域和全球对话的能力。	Indeed, the US is pursuing a strategy of primacy in Asia, not a partnership between equals, and this, together with China’s own internal tensions, is undermining China’s ability to participate productively in regional and global forums.
这证明了米尔顿·弗里德曼和埃德蒙·菲尔普斯（Edmund Phelps）及其他人的批评，他们开始指出，菲利普斯曲线只代表了短期关系。	This vindicated criticism by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, among others, who had already begun to argue that the Phillips curve represented merely a short-term relationship.
CARe研讨会的一些与会者强调这个问题，指出要成功实施耐药性策略，政府必须在全球医疗责任和本地公共品之间达成一个平衡。	Several participants at the CARe symposium highlighted this problem, noting that to implement drug-resistance strategies successfully, governments must strike a balance between global medical responsibility and local public good.
最后，尽管对“应试教育”的担心不无道理，但有证据表明设计合理的教师评估体系可以改善公立和私利学校的激励和表现。	Finally, despite legitimate concerns about “teaching to the test,” there is evidence that properly designed teacher evaluations can improve incentives and performance in public and private schools alike.
而衡量股票市场价格是否处于合理范围的周期调整市盈率数据CAPE现在也高于2008年危机前，甚至1929年大萧条初期的水平。	The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which measures whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is now higher than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great Depression in 1929.
只有充分考虑到不同国家间的移民流动，才能确保在欧洲范围内采取现实的管制措施，而实现这样的目标需要整个欧盟采取共同认可的政策。	Realistic restrictions in Europe can be adopted only by taking into account migration spillovers across jurisdictions, which requires implementing policies that are agreed at the EU level.
布雷顿森林机构的失败之一是它有一个全职股东董事会来代表出资国意愿，该董事会总是因为过度微观管理而破坏项目的效果，并且常常要求互相矛盾的贷款条件。	One failing of the Bretton Wood institutions is their full-time shareholder boards of directors, which tend to undermine effectiveness by micro-managing and often requesting conflicting lending conditions.
2017年选举结果的详细分析表明明，工党出人意料的胜利几乎完全可以归因于出于希望“搅黄”英国退欧动机的富裕年轻选民。	Detailed analysis of the 2017 election returns has shown that Labour’s unexpected gains were due almost entirely to affluent young voters whose motivation was the hope of derailing Brexit.
这一微小的激励起了作用：收到食用油的家长的女儿，在16岁前结婚的可能性要低30 % ， 所产生的收益四倍于成本。	This modest incentive worked: daughters of recipients were up to 30% less likely to marry before 16, yielding benefits four times higher than the costs.
问题是这些来自短期再购协议的现金却成为了许多关键金融企业资产负债表中的主要部分，一旦金融市场像2008年那样发生动荡，这些企业就将遭受重创，大批企业一时间断绝了再购协议资金来源，而其中有一些企业，比如贝尔斯登，只能宣告破产。	But, with the cash coming from short-term repos making up much of core financial firms’ balance sheets, tremors in financial markets could hit them hard, drying up repo financing for a few, as occurred in 2008. Some, like Bear Stearns, then failed.
这就是我决定投资6500万美元给全球抗击艾滋病、结核病和疟疾基金（Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria，以下简称全球基金）的原因。	That is why I have decided to invest $65 million in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
这一集中在单一的、挑战重重的地区的目标相当温和；但也相当现实并且可以实现 — — 而潜在回报相当巨大。	This goal, which focuses on a single challenge-plagued region, may seem modest; but it is also realistic and achievable – and the potential returns are massive.
世界需要在整个地区内遏制伊朗的政策 — — 包括支持伊拉克北部和叙利亚的库尔德人以及其他反抗伊朗的组织和国家。	What is needed is a policy of containment of Iran across the region – including support for the Kurds in northern Iraq and Syria, as well as of other groups and countries that are pushing back against Iran.
但这种管制与杀伤性低价策略相结合则暴露出了中国垄断稀土的企图，而对日本的实质性稀土禁运则似乎是对这种垄断迷梦的一次利益测试。	But this regulation, when combined with China’s aggressive pricing, suggests a desire to assert monopoly control, and the de facto ban of rare-earth exports to Japan looks like an effort to test the benefits of this looming monopoly.
因此，我们首先必须重新恢复G20增长协议（该协议如今已降格为国际货币基金组织所谓“一项针对那些财政失衡国家的深入分析报告 ” ） 所包含的全球合作大视野。	So, first, we must restore the broad vision of global cooperation contained in the G-20 growth pact (which has since been downgraded to what the IMF now calls “an in-depth analysis of…those countries identified as having large imbalances”).
如果沙特王朝垮台且国家分裂成由圣战派别和部落所统治的敌对领土，叙利亚和利比亚的内战相比之下将会成为次要冲突。	Should the Al Saud dynasty fall and the country splinter into rival territories ruled by jihadi factions and tribes, the civil wars in Syria and Libya will seem like minor conflicts in comparison.
欧盟最近通过了一项措施确保被算法影响的民众拥有“解释权 ” ； 但只有时间才能告诉我们这种方法的实际效果。	The European Union recently adopted a measure guaranteeing people affected by algorithms a “right to an explanation”; but only time will tell how this will work in practice.
教育不但能传授生活技能，更能提高适应力和自力更生的能力，有助于满足受冲突影响的儿童的心理和社会需求，因此，这是难民的一项基本需求。	Because education not only imparts life skills, but also promotes resilience and self-reliance, and helps address the psychological and social needs of children impacted by conflict, it is a basic need for refugees.
但是，我们似乎存有一种独特的“解释深度错觉 ” 。 这一错觉相信，我们所掌握的有关深奥的因果关系的理解要高于我们的实际理解。	But we seem to have a specific “illusion of explanatory depth” – the belief that we possess a more profound causal understanding than we really do.
今年，世界领导人将讨论下一代可持续性、发展和气候框架，在此过程中，他们需要将安全和互相依赖置于应对措施的核心。	This year, as world leaders discuss the next generation of sustainability, development, and climate frameworks, they will need to put their security and mutual dependence at the heart of the responses.
但是，似乎没有人愿意考虑她的英雄般的资格的缺乏，可以在万一总统心跳停止倒下时她是否有能力接任总统的职位。	But no one seems disposed to contemplate her heroic lack of qualifications to sit a heartbeat away from the Oval Office.
但这也并不是说美国从未违反国际规则；它最近的举动可比那些它们本应回应的中国政策更加明显地违反了这些规则。	And it is not as if the US has never violated international rules; its recent moves amount to clearer violations of those rules than the Chinese policies to which they are supposed to be a response.
正如英国退出的可能性在一开始没有引起重视，美国共和党和民主党的政治精英们也极少有人从一开始就认真对待特朗普要争取共和党提名的企图。	Just as the possibility of Brexit was initially dismissed, few political elites, Republican and Democratic alike, took seriously Trump’s bid for the Republican nomination.
但她的欧元区政策是意大利现任民粹主义政府发誓要阻挠未来欧盟贸易协定、煽动难民危机并威胁造成又一次欧元区恐慌的一个主要因素。	And yet her eurozone policies are a big reason why Italy now has a populist government vowing to block future EU trade deals, inflaming the refugee crisis, and threatening another eurozone panic.
肇始于 2007 年美国次贷危机的这一轮金融海啸，起源地是美国一些“大到倒不得”的银行。 危机伊始，不少观察家便由此断定，它标志着美国式金融资本主义的终结。	The crisis that began in 2007 originated in the sub-prime mortgage sector in the United States, and in US banks that were “too big to fail,” prompting many observers at the outset to predict the end of American financial capitalism.
由于伪旗的不完善性以及关于攻击来源的传闻被广泛认为是可靠的（尽管未经法律验证 ） ， 对攻击者软实力的名誉伤害也能形成威慑。	To the extent that false flags are imperfect and rumors of the source of an attack are widely deemed credible (though not legally probative), reputational damage to an attacker’s soft power may contribute to deterrence.
对于欧元区，认为其经济增长可能即将起飞或许已经足以 — — 至少到目前为止是如此 — — 让人觉得你应该去看看精神科医生。	When it comes to the eurozone, embracing the idea that economic growth may be about to take off might be enough, at least until recently, to earn one a referral to a mental-health specialist.
这些后果包括：日益加剧的不平等，居高不下还在上升的失业率，伴随失业的经常性公司结构重组、公共服务和社会福利项目所面临的威胁，以及一种普遍的不安全感。	As a result, France suffers from growing inequality, high and still-rising unemployment, constant corporate restructurings entailing layoffs, threats to public services and social welfare programs, and a general feeling of insecurity.
事实上，自21世纪初沦为“欧洲病夫”的失去的十年以来，德国只在几个领域实现了对其他发达经济体的赶超。	In fact, since its lost decade as the “sick man of Europe” in the 2000s, Germany has caught up with other advanced economies in only some areas.
如果我们用推销 “替代方案”的头脑空空的民粹主义者来取代自私自利的精英，那么把这些人赶出政府实现不了我们的目标。	Tossing out self-serving elites will not work, if we replace them with clueless populists peddling “alternative facts.”
同样令人联想到跨太平洋伙伴关系的是，协议也制定了数字经济和扩大版权及生物数据等领域知识产权覆盖的相关条款 — — 这对美国企业而言是一种胜利，而对反全球化势力而言则是一种失败。	Also reminiscent of the TPP, there are provisions for the digital economy and the extension of intellectual property rights in areas like copyright and biologics data – wins for US corporations and setbacks for anti-globalizers.
这是一个奇怪的历史扭曲。 在日本北方四岛被占领后，岛上的日本原住民或者被杀，或者被逐，而许多乌克兰人在苏联时代移民到这些岛上，至今仍生活在那里。	In a strange historical twist, given the Crimean annexation, after the Japanese citizens native to the Northern Territories were killed or expelled, many Ukrainians were brought to the islands during the Soviet years, and still live there.
这个不寻常但准确的表述使人回想起奥古斯特·奈哈特·冯·格奈森瑙将军与普鲁士国王之间的著名问答。 国王认为冯·格奈森瑙在十九世纪早期的爱国主义忧思“不过是些诗歌而已 ” ， “那么宗教，祈文，对领袖的爱，对祖国的爱，这些不是诗歌又是什么呢 ？ ”	That unusual but accurate formulation is reminiscent of General August Neidhardt von Gneisenau’s famous reply to the Prussian King, who dismissed as “nothing more than poetry” von Gneisenau’s patriotic concerns in the early nineteenth century.
当公民得到力量时 — — 比如通过当选某个职位从而得以决定谁可以获得贩酒牌照或谁会因为持有枪支被捕 — — 公众就有权利了解他们。	When citizens acquire power – through, say, an elected position, a job that lets them decide who gets a liquor license or who gets arrested with a gun – the public has a right to know more about them.
但是绝大多数俄罗斯人认为他是一个伟大的领导人，认为是他在短短七年时间里把这个国家从叶利钦时代的破产和绝望中拯救出来走向了今天的繁荣富强。	But most Russians think he is a great leader, crediting him with taking the country from the bankruptcy and despair of the Yeltsin era to wealth and prosperity in just seven years.
熊彼特最著名的弟子之一 — — 已故的罗伯特·海尔布伦纳（Robert Heilbronner ） — —将经济学看作为“世俗的哲学 ” 。	The late Robert Heilbronner – one of Schumpeter’s most renowned students – viewed economics as “worldly philosophy.”
特朗普那种美国关税将等同于对中国出口商征税还能同时在美国国内创造就业机会的想法可能在经济衰退和大规模失业时是对的。	Trump’s belief that US tariffs would act as a tax on Chinese exporters, while creating jobs in America, might have been valid at a time of recession and mass unemployment.
他们共赢得42%的选票，较2015年11月的选举下降7个百分点，能够确保议会600个议席中的293个。	With a tally of 42%, down seven points compared to the November 2015 election, the AKP was able to secure 293 of the parliament’s 600 seats.
一是一方拒绝向另一方拱手让出领土，导致所谓的“非法占有 ” ； 二是拉德克利夫留下了许多小领地，这些领地属于某一方，但完全被另一方的领土所包围。	In some cases, one country refused to relinquish territory to the other, resulting in so-called “adverse possessions”; in others, Radcliffe left small areas of one country completely surrounded by the other’s territory.
不论她会见哪个高级官员，她都会要求为她转交礼物和传达对赵紫阳的最佳祝愿，中国领导人想必因此会明白外部世界仍然记得赵紫阳，希望赵紫阳获得自由。	By asking whichever senior officials she saw to pass on her gift and her best wishes to Zhao, the Chinese leadership would understand that the outside world was still thinking of him and wanted to ensure his survival.
欧洲央行宣布将提供新的货币政策支持，并决定使用除量化宽松之外的一切工具（它仍然没有购买主权债券 ） 。	The European Central Bank has announced that it will offer new monetary-policy support and has decided to use all instruments short of direct quantitative easing (it is still not buying sovereign bonds).
事实上，布雷维克在他篇杂乱无章的《欧洲独立宣言》中所写的内容或多或少都是霍尔特·怀德斯这些民粹主义者的言论。	In fact, what Breivik wrote in his rambling manifesto, entitled A European Declaration of Independence, is more or less what populists, such as Geert Wilders, have been saying.
因此，目前的美中贸易冲突引起人们担心会造成严重破坏，特别是如果冲突导致更大规模的保护主义和更广范围的“贸易战”的话。	This is why the current confrontation between the US and China has raised fears of serious damage, particularly if it leads to ever-greater protectionism and a wider “trade war.”
这一过程必然还将充满进一步的不确定性和政治风险，因为它所牵涉到的不仅仅是英国的实际或想象中的优势，而是整个欧洲工程的存亡。	That process is sure to be fraught with further uncertainty and political risk, because what is at stake was never only some real or imaginary advantage for Britain, but the very survival of the European project.
德国公共部门目前维持大约相当于GDP的1.3%的盈余，但这主要是因为运气好，而不是政策好：要不是利率低迷、劳动力市场强劲，联邦预算早就变成赤字了。	While Germany’s public sector currently boasts a surplus of about 1.3% of GDP, that is largely the result of good luck, not good policy: without low interest rates and a strong labor market, the federal budget would be in deficit.
随着苏维埃帝国的解体，德国领导人意识到只有在加强欧洲团结的背景下，才有可能实现德国的统一。 他们也准备付出巨大的牺牲去实现这一目标。	As the Soviet empire disintegrated, Germany’s leaders recognized that German reunification was possible only in the context of a more united Europe, and they were prepared to make considerable sacrifices to achieve it.
我们的观点对于SNC及其主要支持者土耳其来说显得太过自由化了，土耳其外交部长声称叙利亚的圣战分子与恐怖主义没有关系。	Our views are much too liberal for the SNC, and its key backer, Turkey, whose foreign minister has said that jihad in Syria is not related to terrorism.
但是，在此期间，各国政府可以要求欧洲央行有所动作 — — 欧洲央行正是由欧元区成员国按比例提供完全担保的。	But, in the meantime, governments can call upon the European Central Bank, which the eurozone member states already fully guarantee on a pro rata basis.
事实上，证据指向了相反的方向：最高法院裁定Myriad公司的BRCA（乳腺癌）基因专利无效催生了大量创新，带来了成本更低、效果更好的测试手段。	In fact, there is evidence to the contrary: When the Supreme Court invalidated Myriad’s patent on the BRCA gene, it led to a burst of innovation that resulted in better tests at lower costs.
还有一种选择是，他可以撤回中国一直反对的美国新型萨德（末段高空防御）反导系统 — — 前提是朝鲜废除其核计划。	Alternatively, he could offer to withdraw the US’s new THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile system – to which China has objected – from South Korea as soon as North Korea scraps its nuclear program.
内塔尼亚���会认为，伊核协议开启了一个10—15年的机会窗口以供创造性政治家精神重塑地区政治，这一概念纯属政治失心疯。	Netanyahu would dismiss as political lunacy the notion that the nuclear agreement opened a 10-15-year window for creative statesmanship to reshape regional politics.
他已经三次被一家莫斯科刑事法庭传唤在一起事涉阿列克谢•乌卢卡耶夫（Alexei Ulyukaev）的诉讼中作证，乌卢卡耶夫曾担任经济发展部部长。	He has been summoned three times by a Moscow criminal court to testify in a case against Alexei Ulyukaev, a former minister of economic development.
如果中国的终极目标包括人民币国际化，那么其更为直接的目标，部分也是由于美国对中国和其他国家实施的关税和制裁，则是推动国际体系的去美元化进程。	If China’s ultimate goals include internationalizing the renminbi, its more immediate objective, prompted in part by US tariffs or sanctions on China and other countries, is de-dollarization of the international system.
此外，如果世界银行全球贫困委员会采取多维度贫困衡量指标，将刺激其他组织收集和共享更加详细的贫困数据。	Moreover, if the World Bank’s Commission on Global Poverty adopts multidimensional poverty measures, it will spur other organizations to produce and share more detailed poverty data.
19世纪60年代，女性印度博帕尔穆斯林统治者Sikandar Begum写了一篇毫不掩饰的评价，说麦加是一座“野蛮忧郁的”城市 ， “ 肮脏且排水不良”的街道充斥着疾病和混乱。	In the 1860s, the female Indian Muslim ruler of Bhopal, Sikandar Begum, wrote a warts-and-all account of Mecca as a “wild and melancholy-looking” city whose “dirty and ill-drained” streets were filled with disease and disorder.
我们最近进行的研究表明，这样的“财政货币贬值 ” ， 无论在国内生产总值，消费还是就业和通胀方面，对经济产生的影响与贬低本国货币汇率产生的影响相当。	Our recent research demonstrates that such a “fiscal devaluation” has very similar effects on the economy in terms of its impact on GDP, consumption, employment, and inflation.
如果发生这一情形，该国债务负担就会再次激增，达到不可持续水平，迫使政府 — — 在阿根廷的例子中，政府正在偿付大部分债务 — — 对所有债权人违约。	If that happens, the country’s debt burden will surge again, become unsustainable, and force the government – in this case Argentina, which is servicing most of its debt – to default again on all creditors.
除了欧元区危机之外，亚洲国家也应当在本区域1990年代的危机中的得到教训，认识到对跨境资金流的有效管理需要构建完善的国家，区域和全球应对措施。	Asian countries have learned from their region’s own crisis in the 1990’s, as well as from the eurozone’s ongoing crisis, that effective management of cross-border capital flows requires well-constructed national, regional, and global responses.
可一旦英国脱欧就得在所有主要边境口岸设立海关检查站，也将对20年前恢复了北爱尔兰地区和平的《耶稣受难日协定》产生潜在的危险影响。	But if either were to leave, customs checkpoints would have to be established at all major border crossings, with potentially dangerous implications for the Good Friday Agreement, which restored peace in Northern Ireland a generation ago.
根据联合国气象主席克里斯蒂安娜·菲格雷斯（Christiana Figueres）所说，煤作为燃料的发展“对环境和人类健康的成本高得令人无法接受 。 ”	According to Christiana Figueres, the United Nations climate chief, coal-fueled development has “an unacceptably high cost to human and environmental health.”
而在墨西哥唯一一个规定代孕行为合法的行政区划塔巴斯科，已经限制只能为妻子不孕的异性已婚夫妇提供代孕服务。	And in Mexico, the state of Tabasco, the only jurisdiction in the country where surrogacy is legal, has restricted it to Mexican heterosexual married couples in which the wife is infertile.
如果您是一个体面人，借用美国联邦调查局前局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey）最近向美国国会作证时使用的一个短语，投资委内瑞拉债券应该让您“略感恶心 ” 。	If you are a decent human being, investing in Venezuelan bonds should make you feel “mildly nauseous,” to borrow a phrase recently used by former FBI Director James Comey while testifying to the US Congress.
阿根廷退出锁定美元事件是一场灾难，它导致大量的合同违约，财富重新分配，破产，储户挤兑存款，汇率限制，短期内对资本流动的严格限制。	Argentina’s exit from its dollar peg was a traumatic experience, concentrating contract violations, wealth redistribution, defaults, bank runs, exchange restrictions, and severe limitations on capital movements into a short period of time.
八国集团代表了将近10亿人口，已经承诺将向非洲提供的援助从2004年的250亿美元提高到2010年的500亿美元。 这一数字差额只是富有的援助国家收入的1%的十分之一不到！	The G-8, representing nearly one billion people, has promised to increase aid to Africa from $25 billion in 2004 to $50 billion in 2010 – a difference that represents less than one-tenth of one 1% of the income of the rich donor world!
什么让以色列总理 、 “ 比比 ” （ Bibi）内塔尼亚胡接受美国国会共和党的邀请前来抨击总统奥巴马的伊朗政策还不让白宫知道？	"What possessed Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin “Bibi"" Netanyahu to accept an invitation from the Republicans in the US Congress to come and attack President Barack Obama's policy on Iran without letting the White House know?"
阿拉斯加陆地油田和俄罗斯北部陆上天然气田大规模产出碳氢化合物已有多年，但相比北冰洋底的预测储量根本算不了什么。	On land, oil fields in Alaska and gas fields in northern Russia have been producing hydrocarbons on a large scale for many years, but the estimated reserves under the Arctic Ocean are much larger.
平均而言，斯堪的那维亚国家里国家就业的份额在整个就业中占据32.7 % 。 与此相比，非斯堪的那维亚的欧盟15国平均为18.5 % 。	On average the share of state employment in the workforce across Scandinavia is 32.7%, compared to only 18.5% on average in the non-Scandinavian countries of the EU-15.
而从大部分发达经济体持续低迷的增长和通缩风险看，货币决策者将不得不继续用新的“非常规非常规”货币政策一个人战斗。	And, in view of persistent lackluster growth and deflation risk in most advanced economies, monetary policymakers will have to continue their lonely fight with a new set of “unconventional unconventional” monetary policies.
重塑公共信任需要深度持续的投入，以及足够广泛、能够克服如今在发达经济体普遍存在的政治和社会分裂的新共识。	Restoring public trust will require a deep and sustained commitment, and a new consensus that is broad enough to overcome the political and social divides that are now legion across advanced economies.
伦敦 — — “阿拉伯春天运动”开始后中东政治动荡的三年间，沙特一直试图利用一切必要手段确保其地区领导地位。	LONDON – During the three years of political upheaval in the Middle East since the “Arab Spring” began, Saudi Arabia has attempted to maintain its dominant status in the region by any means necessary.
诺贝尔奖获得者弥尔顿·弗里德曼 — — 也是我最喜爱的经济学家之一 — — 曾于1970年撰写了一篇影响极大的文章，认为企业的唯一社会责任就是增加其利润，而我对此则不以为然。	In 1970, the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman – one of my favorite economists – wrote an influential article arguing that the only social responsibility of business is to increase its profits. On that point, I disagree with him.
我邀请他们出席3月17—18日在巴登巴登（Baden-Baden）举行的G20财政部长和央行行长会议。	I have invited them to attend the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting on March 17-18 in Baden-Baden.
据估计，欧洲将发生巨大的电子技能缺口，如能填补这一缺口，将可以给2015年带来850,000个潜在工作岗位，到2020年还能再翻一番。	It is estimated that Europe will have an e-skills gap that, if filled, could lead to 850,000 potential jobs in 2015, rising to twice that by 2020.
然而，书生气而且虚弱的左派，却在不停地发表数据观点、政策摘要以及白皮书 — — 并且自从克林顿时代以来，基本上是一直失败的 — — 直到一对年轻的夫妇出现并且明白了，美国人不仅阅读；他们还看。	Meanwhile, the nerdy, wonky left kept issuing data points, policy summaries, and white papers –�and generally, since Clinton, kept losing – until a young couple showed up and understood that Americans don’t just read; they watch.
至于网络技术，我们是不是应该担心另一幕科幻小说场景 — — 计算机网络能够发展出其自身的意识并威胁到全人类？	And, as for cybertechnology, should we worry about another science fiction scenario – that a network of computers could develop a mind of its own and threaten us all?
但大部分国家染上了正好相反的综合症：过度依赖资本流入，而资本流入通过刺激国内信用和消费产生了暂时的增长。	But most have suffered from the opposite syndrome: excessive reliance on capital inflows, which, by spurring domestic credit and consumption, generate temporary growth.
此外，在石油价格高企、委内瑞拉经济繁荣、社会主义体制尚未摧毁生产的时候，数百万哥伦比亚人可以去委内瑞拉找到工作。	Moreover, during Venezuela’s boom years, when oil prices were high, and the socialist regime had not yet decimated production, several million Colombians were able to find work in Venezuela.
而追随者们在感觉需要做出变革 — — 在个人，组织或者社会遭遇危机的时候 — — 更容易在领导人身上发现魅力。	Followers are more likely to attribute charisma to leaders when they feel a strong need for change, often in the context of a personal, organizational, or social crisis.
尽管在此轮暴力活动中专家几乎从未做出过正确的推断，但对当前总体军事形势的最佳评估是危机最尖锐的阶段已经过去了。	Though pundits have been wrong about almost everything so far in this round of violence, the best current assessment of the overall military situation is that the acute phase of the crisis is past.
正如笔者在拙作《权力的未来》一书中所论证的那样，信息时代其中一个最重大的权力转换就是非国家参与者的实力增强。	As I argue in my book The Future of Power, one of the great power shifts of this global information age is the strengthening of non-state actors.
也许回答这个问题的最简单方法与我的抗菌素耐药性审查工作有关，这是由前英国首相戴维·卡梅伦于2014年启动的项目。	Perhaps the simplest way to answer this question relates to my work on the AMR review, which was launched by former British Prime Minister David Cameron in 2014.
但是，这里存在困难：如果选择的结构在决定结果上真的是如此重要，是用操纵而不是用强迫来使我们选择其它人已经决定的对我们完全有好处的东西，重要吗？	But here lies the rub: if the architecture of choice is truly so important in determining outcomes, does it really matter if manipulation rather than coercion is used to make us choose what someone else has decided is ultimately good for us?
今天的问题本质上是国内问题，因此不能通过国际机构制定规则来加以解决，更何况破坏国内政策的那些既得利益能够轻易影响所谓的国际体系。	They are domestic in nature and cannot be fixed by rule making through international institutions, which are easily overwhelmed by the same vested interests that undermine domestic policy.
也许更重要的是，国际社会没能站出来讨论如何处理津巴布韦的问题再一次严重地显示了它缺乏制止可预见的危机的政治意愿。	Perhaps more significantly, the international community’s failure to address Zimbabwe seriously shows, once again, that it lacks the political will to prevent foreseeable crises.
华盛顿—至少从2008年秋天开始，领先经济体官员们都 — — 在原则上 — — 同意必须对“太大而不能倒”的金融企业做些什么。	WASHINGTON, DC – At least since the fall of 2008, leading economies’ officials have agreed – in principle – that something must be done about financial firms that are “too big to fail.”
詹姆斯·乔伊斯（James Joyce ） — —他本人并未摆脱爱尔兰民族主义痕迹 — — 写道 ， “ 国籍、语言 、 [ 和]宗教”是“人类诞生”于其中的“网 ” 。	James Joyce – himself not devoid of traces of Irish nationalism – wrote that “nationality, language, [and] religion” are “the nets” into which “a man is born.”
长期来看，中国的核心利益和政策重点在于国内现代化、执政党地位的持续稳定和国家统一（包括台湾问题 ） 。	As a result, China will become a largely inward-looking superpower, which – precisely for that reason – will pursue its foreign-policy interests in a completely unsentimental manner.
埃及和巴勒斯坦当局在阿拉伯世界的眼里很糟糕，这是因为它们拒绝让埃及对加沙负责并可能让���旦对西岸负责。	Egypt and the Palestinian Authority have been made to look bad in the eyes of the Arab world, owing to their refusal to make Egypt responsible for Gaza and possibly Jordan for the West Bank.
美国总统特朗普放大了这些风险，他在外交政策上犯了许多错误，既没能处理好朝鲜危机，还威胁要废除伊朗核协议。	These risks are being exacerbated by US President Donald Trump, who has made a number of foreign-policy missteps, from mishandling the North Korea crisis to threatening to abrogate the Iran nuclear agreement.
更概括的讲，国际社会 — — 尤其是各非洲国家 — — 必须把苏丹人民的利益看得比领导人的利益更重。	More generally, the international community – and African nations in particular – must put the needs of Sudan’s people before the interests of its leaders.
发自纽约 — — 在全世界大部分注意力都集中到了美国总统特朗普贸易战所造成的经济损失上之时，全球贸易的孪生姐妹 — — 外国直接投资 — — 却在很大程度上遭到了忽视。	NEW YORK – While much of the world’s attention is focused on the economic damage being wrought by US President Donald Trump’s trade wars, global trade’s twin – foreign direct investment – has largely been neglected.
首先，为了维持一个低估的实际利率，中国陷入了一个所谓的“美元陷阱 ” ， 以牺牲自身为代价提升了美元的国际地位。	For starters, by maintaining an undervalued real exchange rate, China has fallen into the so-called “dollar trap,” boosting the US dollar’s international importance at China’s own expense.
而乌克兰政府方面则声称本国所面对的经济困难 — — 尤其是军事冲突带来的经济冲击和本国货币格里夫尼亚的大幅贬值 — — 使得自身债务负担无以为继。	Ukraine’s government, for its part, argues that the country’s financial difficulties – in particular the economic effects of the conflict and the plunge in the value of the hryvnia – have made its debt burden unsustainable.
这是有记录以来最疲软的消费复苏 — — 比危机之前12年（1996—2007年）的趋势增长率（3.6 % ） 低整整1.5个百分点。	That is the most anemic consumer recovery on record – fully 1.5 percentage points slower than the 12-year pre-crisis trend of 3.6% that prevailed between 1996 and 2007.
许多化学调节因子也参与其中，包括肾上腺分泌的血浆皮质醇和肾上腺素、其他的荷尔蒙和神经传递素（如血清素和去甲肾上腺素 ） 、 以及自律系统和免疫系统的反应。	Many chemical mediators are involved, including cortisol and adrenalin from the adrenal glands, other hormones and neurotransmitters (such as serotonin and noradrenalin), and responses from the autonomic and immune systems.
1998年10月 ， 《 经济学人 》 （ The Economist）刊登了生动的封面配图，中国废墟被一个强大的漩涡吞没。 这说明了一切。	An October 1998 cover story in The Economist, vividly illustrated by a Chinese junk getting sucked into a powerful whirlpool, said it all.
而如果发达经济体目前的情况再维持一个十年，那么直升机撒钱、债务货币化和现金税可能成为新的QE、CE、FG、ZIRP和NIRP。	And if current conditions in the advanced economies remain entrenched a decade from now, helicopter drops, debt monetization, and taxation of cash may turn out to be the new QE, CE, FG, ZIRP, and NIRP.
比如，以色列总理内塔尼亚胡一直要求巴勒斯坦权力机构停止为杀害以色列人的囚犯的家庭发放社会福利，试图将这些配给说成是某种形式的报酬。	For example, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has been calling on the Palestinian Authority to halt social benefits to the families of prisoners who killed Israelis, attempting to portray those allocations as some kind of payoff.
如果不进行大规模干预，朝鲜扩充核武库（预计现在拥有8—12枚装置）并实现核武器微缩化以增加导弹打击面和打击精度将只是时间问题。	Absent a major intervention, it is only a matter of time before North Korea increases its nuclear arsenal (now estimated at 8-12 devices) and figures out how to miniaturize its weapons for delivery by missiles of increasing range and accuracy.
这一策略的高峰出现在1945年8月，美国人用靓妹原子弹从地球上抹去了广岛和长崎 — — 李伯曼对于这幕大概铭记在心。	The bloody high point came in August 1945, when the United States used atomic bombs to obliterate Hiroshima and Nagasaki – which is what Lieberman may well have had in mind.
这也是其他已经签署了建立无核武器条约的五个地区 — — 拉美、南太平洋、东南亚、中亚和非洲 — — 所要汲取的教训。	This is also the lesson of the other five world regions – Latin America, the South Pacific, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Africa – that have adopted treaties establishing zones free of nuclear weapons.
突尼斯民众在拒绝压榨的愤怒中产阶级领导下，自然而然地让人们重温了当今驱动个人和国家行为的稳定而不可抗拒的力量。	The Tunisian people, led by a frustrated middle class that refused to be cowed, thus provide a healthy reminder of the steady and compelling forces driving the behavior of individuals and nations nowadays.
当沙特阿拉伯和科威特等重质原油出口者只失去了很少一部分美国市场份额时，轻质低硫原油出口者 — — 如阿尔及利亚、安哥拉和尼日利亚 — — 几乎丢失了所有在美市场份额。	Exporters of light sweet crude – such as Algeria, Angola, and Nigeria – lost nearly all of their market share in the US, while exporters of sour or heavier crude, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have lost little.
随着肉类消费的增加，光是大豆产量就将接近翻番，这意味着土地、化肥、杀虫剂和水等投入品用量的相应增加。	With expanded meat consumption, soybean production alone would nearly double, implying a proportional increase in the use of inputs like land, fertilizer, pesticides, and water.
对梅隆门下的“清算主义者”来说，2008年之前的经济充斥着危险的增长 — — 无论是银行业、房地产还是股票 — — 要使经济恢复稳健增长就得将其切除。	To “liquidationists” of Mellon’s ilk, the pre-2008 economy was full of cancerous growths – in banking, in housing, in equities – which need to be cut out before health can be restored.
与其父哈桑二世国王不同，穆罕默德支持拉夫地区的本土柏柏尔（Berber）文化，并投入资金将里夫沿海地带改造为制造业枢纽。	Unlike his father, King Hassan II, Mohammed has supported the region’s indigenous Berber culture, and made investments to turn the Rif coastal region into a manufacturing hub.
借助正确的措施，它就能实现从中等收入到高收入状态的平稳过渡 — — 这不仅关乎13亿中国人的福祉，也会降低全球经济风险和不确定性因素。	With the right approach, it can manage a smooth transition from middle- to high-income status – a transition that would not only improve the wellbeing of China’s 1.3 billion citizens, but also reduce risks and uncertainties in the global economy.
左翼退欧派拒绝DiEM25（ 2月份成立于柏林的激进党派欧洲运动民主党）所提出的从内部改变欧盟的泛欧洲运动。	Lexiteers reject the call issued by DiEM25 (the radical Democracy in Europe Movement, launched in Berlin in February) for a pan-European movement to change the EU from within.
法国总统候选人菲永（François Fillon）在刚刚举行的法国大选中承诺，如果他当选就会举行两次公投 — — 并且表示法国需要多达五次公投。	François Fillon, a candidate for the French presidency, promised two referenda if he won the recent election – and suggested that France needs as many as five.
除与俄罗斯有着长期的文化联系外，塞尔维亚完全依赖俄罗斯的能源供应，以及俄罗斯作为联合国安理会常任理事国的否决权。	In addition to its longstanding cultural ties with Russia, Serbia depends on Russian energy supplies, as well as Russia’s veto power as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
由于人类倾向于通过联想起相关事例的难易程度来评估一种情况出现的可能性，而这种认知偏好又是普遍存在的 — — 也就是所谓的“可用性启发（availability heuristic ） ” ，通常会令事情变得更加模糊不清。	The “availability heuristic” – a pervasive cognitive bias caused by people’s tendency to estimate the likelihood of a phenomenon by how easily an example of it comes to mind – routinely clouds the issue.
凡勃伦是作为社会科学家、通过提炼道德判断写下这番话的，尽管他令读者毫不质疑在大量人口生活在贫困时他对这类支出的态度。	Veblen wrote as a social scientist, refraining from rendering moral judgments, though he left readers in little doubt about his attitude toward such expenditure in a time when many lived in poverty.
特朗普最近更加奇怪的举动 — — 包括更加频繁、更加歇斯底里的推特 — — 被广泛认为是因为他 越来越意识到，民主党掌控众议院对他的总统生涯意味着什么。	Trump’s ever-stranger behavior of late – including more frequent and more hysterical tweets – has been widely attributed to his growing realization of what the Democrats’ takeover of the House of Representatives means for his presidency.
那种更大的目标是英国的“留欧”宣传除前首相戈登·布朗的“引领 — — 而非退出”的主题演讲外，未能为其国内选民提供的东西。	That larger vision is one the UK’s “Remain” campaign, with the notable exception of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s “Lead – Not Leave” speech, did not offer to its own constituency.
这里的自相矛盾之处在于，欧洲监管机构（包括德国监管机构）实际上一直在与美国的谈判中要求放宽这些监管规定的应用。	The paradox here is that European regulators, including German regulators, have in fact been arguing for looser application of those regulations in negotiations with the United States.
法兰克福—自欧洲经济与货币联盟（EMU）成立以来，从未取得迈向政治联盟的进步 — — 甚至连真正的尝试都没有。	FRANKFURT – Since Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was created, no progress toward political unification has been made – or even really attempted.
文学、历史和艺术 — — 学习同理心、开发情商、将批判性思维和普世价值相调和 — — 并没有因为学习机会的减少而变得不再有意义。	The rationale for studying literature, history, and art – to learn empathy, develop our emotional intelligence, and reconcile critical thinking with universal values – has not disappeared with the opportunities to do so.
2015年中国跨境贸易中有35%为人民币结算（其余大部分为美元结算 ） ， 而今天这一比例下降到12%左右。	And whereas 35% of China’s cross-border trade was settled in RMB in 2015 (with most of the remainder in dollars), that share has fallen to about 12% today.
正在上演欧元区危机主要集中在欧洲，但是紧缩和增长的论战如何在那里收场，这关系到更多的国家，包括美国。	The drama of the ongoing eurozone crisis has focused attention on Europe, but how the austerity-growth debate plays out there is more broadly relevant, including for the United States.
但是，如果这些经济刺激计划得以明智地实施，就将会带来影响深远以及变革性的趋势，为二十一世纪急需的、更为可持续的绿色经济奠定基础。	Spent wisely, however, these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends, setting the stage for a more sustainable, urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century.
该行业不仅是主要出口来源（2017年食品、饲料和饮料的出口额高达1330亿美元 ） ， 而且很多农村地区都是支持特朗普和共和党的大本营票仓。	Not only is the sector a major exporter ($133 billion of foods, feed, and beverages in 2017), but many rural areas are bastions of support for Trump and the Republicans in general.
就象秘鲁作家Mario Vargas Llosa指出的那样，那些以保持文化身份为由反对全球化的人，其实暴露了一种停滞的文化态度，不会被历史所接受。	As the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has put it, those who argue in favor of cultural identity and against globalization, betray a stagnant attitude towards culture that is not borne out by historical fact.
在这样的环境下，重组是值得追求的选择，因为这能够防止IMF所注入的资金全都被用于偿付债权人 — — 在乌克兰的例子中还包括俄罗斯。	In such circumstances, restructuring is desirable, because it prevents the money injected by the IMF from simply going to pay off a country’s creditors, which in Ukraine’s case includes Russia.
《利维坦》的主角、脾气暴躁的尼古拉（Nikolai）眼睁睁看着自己的生活沦为与镇长争夺他的海滨产业的斗争。	Nikolai, Leviathan's hotheaded main character, sees his life consumed by the fight to save his seashore property from the town's mayor.
讽刺的是，美国和沙特口风升级之前两天，即5月19日，伊朗刚刚进行了大选，现任总统鲁哈尼领导的温和派击败了他们的强硬派反对者。	Ironically, the escalation of US and Saudi rhetoric came just two days after Iran’s May 19 election, in which moderates led by incumbent President Hassan Rouhani defeated their hardline opponents at the ballot box.
如果该国重新捡起2008年时的政策应对措施 — — 即完全依靠大规模财政和货币刺激措施来支撑需求，那么情况可能会变得更糟。	The situation could be made worse if the country repeats the policy responses of 2008 – namely, relying exclusively on massive fiscal and monetary stimulus to prop up demand.
事实上，此类企业几乎在不知不觉间从新加坡和上海这样的亚洲特大城市到芬兰埃斯波和荷兰德文格洛这样的欧洲小城如雨后春笋般随处可见。	In fact, such firms are emerging – almost unnoticed – everywhere, from Asian megalopolises like Singapore and Shanghai to small European cities like Espoo in Finland and Dwingeloo in the Netherlands.
相反，特朗普试图让剩余的美军叙利亚，声称部队在此的主要目的 — — 击败伊斯兰国 — — 已经实现。	On the contrary, Trump is about to withdraw the remaining US troops from Syria, arguing that their main objective – defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) – has been achieved.
在美国，街头抗议终结了越南战争，而大规模的民权运动，正如马丁·路德·金所说的那样，使“正常的商业活动”都难以进行。	In the United States, street protests helped bring the Vietnam war to an end, and the mass protests of the civil rights movement showed that, as Martin Luther King, Jr. put it, “business as usual” could no longer continue.
而该国在很大程度上同质化的人口 — — 逊尼派穆斯林占90%以上 — — 也令其避免陷入困扰伊拉克和叙利亚等国家的宗派冲突并且成立了强大的中央政府。	And its largely homogenous population – 90% Sunni Muslim – has allowed it to avoid the sectarian conflicts plaguing countries like Iraq and Syria, and to forge a strong central government.
天安号的沉没似乎并不是一个孤立事件，而是北朝鲜整体行为模式所发生的变化，这些因素也使围绕应对之策所展开的争论变得更加复杂。	The debate about how to respond is complicated by the fact that the Cheonan’s sinking does not seem to be a stand-alone event, but was, instead, part of a change in North Korea’s general pattern of behavior.
相反，在过去30年，一个“卓越阶级 ” （ overclass）浮现，这一阶级比镀金时代的强盗大亨的相对经济实力还要强。	Instead, during the past 30 years, an “overclass” has emerged, one that exercises even more relative economic power than Gilded Age robber barons did.
当然，美国还是以色列的人寿保险单，但是，即使不是以色列社会，以色列外交官也开始认为外交联盟的扩大和多样化是关键的。	America, of course, remains Israel’s life insurance policy, but enlargement and diversification of diplomatic alliances is starting to be seen as crucial by Israeli diplomats, if not by Israeli society.
仔细规划、资源充足的污染控制策略应用能让发展中国家避免过去的经济增长所伴随的最糟糕的人道和生态灾难。	Careful planning and well-resourced application of pollution-control strategies can enable developing countries to avoid the worst kinds of human and ecological disasters that have accompanied economic growth in the past.
在数字化技术 — — 常被描述为21世纪的工业革命 — — 迅速推广的前提下，欧盟生产率增长下降的情况其实相当出人意料。	The decline in productivity growth in the EU is surprising, given the rapid onset of digitalization – often described as the industrial revolution of the twenty-first century.
但非洲国家的确具有某些共同之处：农业政策领域的大规模改善，人口状况的提高以及新技术在未来十年间创造的崭新机遇。	But African countries do have some things in common: widespread improvements in farm policy, improved demographic conditions, and the availability of new technologies create new opportunities for the decade ahead.
同样，2012年截止到11月的后四个月中个人储蓄率仅为3.5 % ， 这还不到1970~1999年7.9%的平均储蓄率的一半。	Similarly, the personal-saving rate, at just 3.5% in the four months ending in November 2012, was less than half the 7.9% average of 1970-99.
但是“反恐战争”并不能够开脱美国攻击一个主权国家并且推翻其政府的决定。 美国的推测是错误的，也就是伊拉克藏有大规模杀伤性武器并且与2001年的恐怖攻击事件有牵连。	But the “war on terror” did not warrant the decision to attack a sovereign state and topple its government on the flawed presumption that it housed weapons of mass destruction and was linked to the 2001 attacks.
接受高等教育的女性比例正在接近60%大关，2010年女大学生入学率增加28 % ， 1993年增长率为20 % 。	The proportion of women receiving higher education is approaching the 60% mark, owing to an impressive 28% annual rate of growth in their enrollment numbers in 2010, up from a 20% increase in 1993.
但政府也必须落实其2011年所承诺的政治改革；放松对经济的把持；并促进包容性增长和繁荣，包括解决深刻的地区差异。	But the government will also have to follow through on the political reforms it promised in 2011; loosen its grip on the economy; and promote inclusive growth and prosperity, including by addressing deep regional disparities.
尽管印度的教育正在发展，特别是在初高中教育方面，但印度高等教育体系 — — 包括技术和职业教育与培训 — — 仍然不足。	Despite India’s educational expansion, especially at the secondary and tertiary levels, its system of higher education, including technical and vocational education and training, remains inadequate.
原因在于通过数字就业平台找工作的多数个人是以独立承包商的身份，致使他们享受不到全职和兼职员工标准雇佣合同规定的福利和保护。	This is because most individuals who find work through digital job platforms operate as independent contractors, leaving them without the benefits and protections provided in standard employment contracts for full-time and part-time workers.
只要收入源以及新规则的未来影响尚不明确，受这些政策伤害最大的人群 — — 美国最大的储蓄者 — — 就不可能投资。	As long as that revenue’s sources, and the future effects of new regulations, remain uncertain, those whom the policies would most harm – the country’s largest savers – are unlikely to invest.
中国的巨额外部盈余 — — 2007年超过GDP的10 % — —在最近几年大幅收窄，贸易失衡程度已下降至GDP的约2.5 % 。	China’s large external surplus – above 10% of GDP in 2007 – has narrowed significantly in recent years, with the trade imbalance falling to about 2.5% of GDP.
值此脸书、亚马逊、腾讯和阿里巴巴等科技巨头正在借助以数字技术为基础的配对商业模式推动面向“超集中”的转变时，这种情况就更加明显。	This is all the more true at a time when tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, Tencent, and Alibaba – with matchmaking-based business models turbo-boosted by digital technology – are propelling a shift toward “ultra-concentration.”
但是他们还是大失所望。 欧盟积极推动申请入盟国家的人权，但是并没有表现出它有能力在全世界施加影响力。	The European Union has been a positive force in promoting rights in those countries aspiring to membership, but it has not demonstrated a capacity to exercise influence worldwide.
去年 12 月，萨利赫号召举行全国对话，但前提是必须遵守他所制定的章程：胡塞人和南方领袖将被排除在谈判之外，除非他们支持让萨利赫几十年来一直执掌大权的也门宪法。	Last December, Saleh called for national dialogue, but on his own terms: the Houthis and the southern leaders are to be excluded from the discussions unless they support the Yemeni constitution that has kept Saleh in power for decades.
本拉登经常引用诗歌来强调某一观点并且把他自己与勇猛善战而又饱学多识的武士联系起来。 这些武士情愿为了伊斯兰的荣耀而成为烈士。	Bin Laden often recites poetry to underscore a point and to associate himself with chivalrous and learned warriors who were willing to become martyrs for Islam’s honor and glory.
但即使你跑起来，你也无法真正跨出跑步机，进入新领域 — — 因此你永远不会比跑步机设定的速度跑得更快。	But when you run, you can never really get ahead of the treadmill and cover new terrain – so you never run faster than the speed that is set.
第三次工业革命期间，电子和信息通信技术导致生产模式进一步自动化，从而使很多人类工作从制造业向服务业转移。	During the Third Industrial Revolution, modes of production were further automated by electronics and by information and communication technology, with many human jobs moving from manufacturing into services.
美国增长相对强劲的预期早已反映在市场中 — — 贸易加权的美元价值自2014年年中以来已升值9 % 。	The expectation of relatively strong US growth is already being reflected in the markets, with the dollar up 9% in trade-weighted terms since mid-2014.
与此相反，在中国这样的一党制国家中，他们发现与官员做生意更容易，因为官员们可以迅速做出决定并且在同一时间执行。	By contrast, in China’s one-party state, they find it is easier to do business with officials who can make quick decisions and implement them almost instantly.
原因之一是叙利亚的防空力量要强得多，必须通过轰炸行动才能压制，而轰炸可能会造成大量平民伤亡，飞机和飞行员也有可能遭受损失。	One reason is that Syria has a substantial air-defense system, which would have to be suppressed by a bombing campaign – causing significant civilian casualties and risking the loss of aircraft and crews.
虽然如今大多数法国人可能会倾向支持萨科齐的反移民论调，但这并不保证他就能在2012年继续获得人民的支持。	For, although a majority of French today may be inclined to sympathize with Sarkozy’s immigrant-bashing rhetoric, there is no guarantee that they will re-elect him in 2012.
她可能需要放弃与奥尔斯特的民主联盟党（Democratic Unionist Party）的错误结盟，更加团结一致地与想要软化英国脱欧立场的苏格兰保守党站在一起。	She may have to abandon her ill-considered alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party in Ulster and side more emphatically with the Tories of Scotland, who are keen on a softer version of Brexit.
马凯硕（Kishore Mahbubani）在其著作《大分歧 》 （ The Great Convergence）中如是说。	This is Kishore Mahbubani’s argument in his book The Great Convergence.
最近，中国新增大量美元计价负债，国际清算银行的数据认为在1万亿美元左右（短期和长期债务之和 ） ， 绝不能忽视外部脆弱性。	Given China’s recent build-up of dollar-denominated liabilities, which the Bank for International Settlements currently places at around $1 trillion (for short- and long-term debt, combined), external vulnerability can hardly be ignored.
首先，在欧盟讨论如何对美国10%铝关税和25%钢关税采取反制措施时，着眼点应该超越这一纠纷的经济意义，看到所涉商品的生态意义。	For starters, with the EU debating countermeasures to US tariffs of 10% on aluminum and 25% on steel, it is worth looking beyond the economic significance of the dispute, to the ecological aspects of the commodities in question.
如果进行这一投票 — — 很有可能是10月 — — 由所有反对党和几十位亲欧派保守党组成的策略性联盟很有可能击败政府。	When this vote occurs, probably in October, a tactical alliance of all opposition parties with a dozen pro-European Tories could well defeat the government.
他们必须负责提供安全水源、垃圾收集、安全住房、基础设施、改善贫民窟、保护受灾者，以及在灾难发生时采取紧急措施。	They are the ones responsible for providing safe water, garbage collection, safe housing, infrastructure, upgraded slums, protection from disasters, and emergency services when catastrophes hit.
他们那些勇敢的支持者们节制忍让，奉行非暴力抵抗，却没有意识到当局为了维护权力是不惜动用武力来血腥镇压的。	While their courageous supporters espouse tolerance and practice non-violence, they are overwhelmed by armed government forces who are willing to kill and die to retain power.
虽然一些鲁莽的印度人现在呼吁印度政府采取包括袭击巴基斯坦境内恐怖分子的设施的军事行动，但是，这肯定会导致一场两败俱伤的战争。	Though some hotheads in India now call for military action, including strikes on terrorist facilities in Pakistani territory, this would certainly lead to a war that neither side could win.
我们可以对这句话进行补充 ， “ 希望、希望，当希望丧失殆尽 ， ” 因为让希望保留下去是我们的责任。	To that we might add, “‘Hope, hope’ when there is no hope,” because it is our responsibility to keep hope alive.
其中有一个问题就是所谓的美洲自由贸易区，这一想法由老布什总统于1990年提出，但在2005年的阿根廷马德普拉塔美洲峰会上谈崩了。	One such issue was the so-called Free-Trade Area of the Americas, which was proposed by former US President George H.W. Bush in 1990, and then collapsed at the Mar del Plata summit in Argentina in 2005.
现实是对宽松的货币政策所营造的飞来横财的依赖可能带来严重的长期影响，特别是如果它们被用来延迟解决基本问题的措施的话。	The reality is that recourse to easy windfalls produced through loose monetary policy could have serious long-term repercussions, especially if they are used to delay efforts to address underlying issues.
此外任何脱离这一传统空间概念的理论都需要实现相当大的观念跳跃，而宇宙项并未对其他预测造成可测量的差异。	Moreover, anything beyond that traditional conception of space required a considerable conceptual leap, while the cosmological term made no measurable difference to other predictions.
由于这三国的媒体都几乎是自闭的 — — 除了“国家”观点之外一切都视而不见 — — 这些政治目的也就从未被适当地阐述过。	Since the press in all three countries is almost autistic in its refusal to reflect anything but the “national” point of view, these politics are never properly explained.
著名美国经济学家欧文·费雪（Irving Fisher）真的构建了一部带有泵和杠杆的精致的液压机，让他能够直观演示市场均衡价格如何应供需变化而动。	The renowned American economist Irving Fisher actually built an elaborate hydraulic machine with pumps and levers, allowing him to demonstrate visually how equilibrium prices in the market adjust in response to changes in supply or demand.
此外，去年12月年度消费者和生产者通胀率分别下降到1.5%和-3.3 % ， 部分原因是全球油价暴跌。	Moreover, annual consumer and producer inflation dropped to 1.5% and -3.3%, respectively, last December, owing partly to the sharp decline in world oil prices.
这些过渡将会很长，一些人将会得利，而另一些人被迫进行艰难的调整，它们的生产率效应需要相当时间才会体现在总数据中。	These transitions will be lengthy, rewarding some and forcing difficult adjustments on others, and their productivity effects will not appear in aggregate data for some time.
但全世界还是以一种另类的方式遂了愿：这玩意在升空1分钟后就爆炸了，碎片落入了大海，没有造成任何伤害。	In a perverse way, the world got its way, because the vehicle exploded a minute after takeoff, its debris falling harmlessly into the sea.
但是，如果说能源价格高企导致了出口下降，那拥有某些世界上最激进气候政策的德国又如何从2000年起出口量增加了一倍？	But if high energy prices lead to declining exports, how is it that Germany, which boasts some of the world’s most ambitious climate policies, has doubled its exports since 2000?
确实，现在有人把萨尔科奇看作是传统戴高乐派人物。 这些人想要通过人为地让欧元贬值来帮助法国的制造商。	Indeed, some now view Sarkozy as a traditional Gaullist who wants to help French producers by artificially devaluing the euro.
与布什为美国高收入阶层制定的大幅减税方案造成的赤字以及为老年人提供健康医疗的医疗保险赤字相比，社会保障体系赤字可谓是相形见拙。	The Social Security deficit pales by comparison with the deficits created by Bush’s huge tax cuts for upper-income Americans or in comparison with the deficit in Medicare, which provides health care for the aged.
印尼种族灭绝 — — 必须这样描述它，即使它的目的是意识形态而非种族、宗教或民族 — — 是大屠杀政治的一个令人警醒的案例研究。	The Indonesian genocide – and it deserves to be so described, even if its impulse was ideological rather than ethnic, religious, or national – is an alarming case study in the politics of mass murder.
今天，用北约秘书长拉斯穆森的话说，北约正逐步演变为“安全伙伴关系的网络枢纽和全球安全事务的咨询中心 。 ”	Today, NATO is becoming, in the words of its secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, “a hub of a network of security partnerships and a center for consultation on global security issues.”
而虽然零碳经济显然在技术上可行且经济上负担得起，但如果没有强有力的公共政策和前瞻性的商业战略就无法实现。	But while a zero-carbon economy is undoubtedly technically feasible and easily affordable, it will not be achieved without strong public policies and forward-looking business strategies.
但真正阻碍诺基亚创造出iPhone和安卓机所带来的那种直观、友好的智能机用户体验的却是公司拒绝放弃曾造就其辉煌的解决方案。	But the largest impediment to Nokia’s ability to create the kind of intuitive, user-friendly smartphone experiences that iPhones and Android devices offered was its refusal to move beyond the solutions that had driven its past success.
事实上，前国务卿赖斯明确地将俄罗斯在乌克兰的行动与“阿富汗撤军谈判”挂钩 ， “ 不论从安全局势看这是否必要 ” 。	In fact, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice explicitly linked Russia’s actions in Ukraine with “talk of withdrawal from Afghanistan, whether the security situation warrants it or not.”
在过去，人们只期望富国降低温室气体排放，在联合国气候变化框架公约中，发展中国家被明确免去了减排责任。	In the past, only rich countries were expected to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions; developing countries were explicitly spared that within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
工作阶级选民群情激奋，因为他们不但觉得自己在经济上遭到了抛弃，在社会上和文化上也遭到了鄙视和边缘化。	Working-class voters have lashed out because they feel not just economically abandoned, but also socially disdained and culturally marginalized.
报告还建议对饲养和保留黑猩猩采取特殊要求：以群的方式饲养，每群至少七只，每只黑猩猩的活动空间不少于1 000平方英尺并配有攀爬设施，为黑猩猩提供寻找食物的活动。	The report also recommends special requirements for keeping the remaining chimps: housing in groups of at least seven, with a minimum of 1,000 square feet per chimp, room to climb, and opportunities to forage for food.
我们这个时代的全球问题需要合作，政治决心和牺牲才能得到解决，而这也是我们为何奉行一个积极的多边机制以推动对全球资源的公平共享。	The global problems of our times necessitate cooperation, political will, and sacrifice. That is why we are following a proactive policy in multilateral institutions to facilitate an equitable sharing of our world’s resources.
因感染好氧革兰氏阳性菌白喉棒状杆菌所造成的白喉是一种毒素介质的急性病，可以表现为上呼吸道感染或皮肤感染。	Diphtheria, caused by the aerobic gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheria, is an acute, toxin-mediated disease that can manifest as an upper respiratory tract infection or a skin infection.
自两年前欧元危机爆发以来，德国的政治路线让它成了孤家寡人，默克尔在意大利、西班牙和法国找不到一位盟友。	Germany’s political course since the beginning of the euro crisis two years ago had left it isolated, and she was no match for an alliance of Italy, Spain, and France.
公共观点必须略微更加反对退欧决定。 目前，认为它“事后看来是个错误”的人要比不那么认为的人多4 % 。	Public opinion must shift slightly further against the Brexit decision, which is already viewed as “wrong in hindsight” by a 4% point margin.
据布什回忆录记载，2007年春，埃胡德·奥尔默特总理径直就叙利亚核反应堆请求美国总统 ： “ 乔治，我请你轰炸核电厂 。 ”	According to Bush’s memoir, in the spring of 2007, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made a blunt request of the US president regarding Syria’s reactor: “George, I am asking you to bomb the facility.”
中国反对印度要求成为核供给集团（Nuclear Suppliers Group）的动议（美国强烈支持 ） 。	China opposed India’s bid (strongly supported by the United States) for membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
曾经与顽固右派眉来眼去的新保守主义评论家威廉·克里斯托尔（William Kristol）表示他讨厌特朗普，为此米勒的导师大卫·霍洛维茨（David Horowitz）说克里斯托尔是“犹奸 ” 。	When William Kristol, a neo-conservative commentator who once flirted with the hard right, expressed his disgust with Trump, David Horowitz, one of Miller’s mentors, called Kristol a “renegade Jew.”
哥伦比亚今天的局势比以往若干年都好，这不能不说是阿尔瓦罗·乌里韦·贝莱斯（Alvaro Uribe）总统领导有方；但哥伦比亚在很多方面却十分怪异，不得不去面对奇怪而又棘手的挑战。	Colombia is in better shape today than it has been for years, thanks largely to President Alvaro Uribe’s leadership, but it remains a bizarre place, one facing strange and intractable challenges.
东盟的十个经济体加上另外六国（澳大利亚、中国、印度、日本、韩国和新西兰）已经同意成立地区全面经济合作伙伴关系。	The ten economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), together with six more countries (Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand), have already agreed to launch the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
我们再也无法忍受无孔不入、无所不能的共产党爪牙，忍受不了他们对工作场所、居住社区、甚至是休闲地域的统治。	We simply had reached the end of our endurance with the omnipresent and all-powerful communist apparatchiks who ruled in our workplaces, neighborhoods, even places of rest.
事实上，这些大幅增加的劳动力压低了劳动力密集型产品的相对价格，该类产品从1989到2008年间价格降低了约15 % 。	Indeed, that massive addition of labor helped to drive down the relative price of labor-intensive goods, which fell by roughly 15% between 1989 and 2008.
例如，法国，意大利和英国的受访者分别认定会有35 ％ ， 34％和38％的本国低收入阶层儿童仍然贫穷，但实际情况是29 ％ ， 27％和31 ％ 。	For example, French, Italian, and British respondents said, respectively, that 35%, 34%, and 38% of low-income children will remain poor, when the reality is that 29%, 27%, and 31% will.
强化和收紧联合国安理会1718号决议（在朝鲜2006年10月第一次核试验之后出台的决议）是最直接的行动措施。	Strengthening and tightening United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, crafted in the wake of North Korea’s first nuclear test in October 2006, should be the immediate task.
可以肯定，随着中东地区的无果战争令美国筋疲力尽，欧洲也把注意力转向自身的危机，今天实现多极话语权的理由比冷战后任何时点都更有说服力。	To be sure, with America exhausted from its fruitless wars in the Middle East, and Europe turning inward as it faces its own crises, the case for a multipolar discourse is more convincing today than at any other time since the Cold War.
直到9月中旬Facebook才同意披露有关政治竞选广告的信息，但仍然拒绝提供与其他形式虚假信息有关的资料。	It was not until mid-September that Facebook even agreed to disclose information about political campaign ads; it still refuses to offer data on other forms of disinformation.
而那些国会议员们 — — 其中许多人都拿到过脸书的助选资金 — — 很大程度上都将话题集中在谴责脸书的粗心大意，而扎克伯格也一本正经地承诺会在安全方面进行更多投资。	Members of Congress – many of whom have received campaign contributions from Facebook – largely limited themselves to denouncing Facebook’s carelessness, and Zuckerberg earnestly promised to invest more in security.
而授予马拉拉·尤沙夫赛（Malala Yousafzai）2014年诺贝尔和平奖也堪称实至名归。 尤沙夫赛是一位巴基斯坦花季少女，因为勇敢地宣扬女孩受教育权而遭到塔利班的枪击。	And it was right on the mark to award the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize to Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager shot by the Taliban for her brave advocacy of girls’ education.
到目前为止，只有少数组织或政府（包括世界银行、美国马萨诸塞州和法国的法兰西岛地区）发行了绿色债券，总的来说数量极为有限。	Until recently, only a few organizations or governments, including the World Bank, the American state of Massachusetts, and the French region of Île de France, issued green bonds, and generally the amounts involved were modest.
中国在过去的一个世纪内发生了巨大的变化，但在某一个方面，它却依然如故：宗教式的政治观念仍在统御着这个国家。	China has changed a great deal in the last century, but it has remained the same in one respect: it is still ruled by a religious concept of politics.
在美国，根据美联储数据，一大半美国家庭没有资格获得能够让他们购买最便宜的在售汽车的贷款（日产骐达轿车，价格为12,825美元 ） 。	In the United States, more than half of American families did not qualify, according to Federal Reserve data, to take out a loan that would allow them to buy the cheapest car for sale (the Nissan Versa sedan, priced at $12,825).
你也许已经预料到了这一转型 — — 对美国来说，2000年是这一转型关键的一年 — — 导致了失业（至少在经济进行了调整之前是如此 ） ， 并伴随生产率的提高。	One might have expected this transition, which reached its pivotal year in the United States in 2000, to cause unemployment (at least until the economy adjusted), accompanied by a rise in productivity.
银行，航空公司，信用卡公司，社交媒体公司，连锁酒店，社团俱乐部和其他组织也应参与其中，以避免被视为依赖通过为这些罪犯服务牟利。	Banks, airlines, credit card companies, social media firms, hotel chains, social clubs, and other organizations should participate as well, to avoid being perceived as profiting from serving such criminals.
到了2011年，危机逐渐向核心区域转移，意大利和西班牙开始坐立不安，甚至有越来越多的人开始质疑欧元区本身的生存能力。	In 2011, the crisis moved to the core, with Italy and Spain feeling the heat, and concerns mounting about the viability of the eurozone itself.
事实上，欧洲央行是第一批与美联储达成协议的央行之一，随后则是其他主要发达国家央行，包括瑞士国民银行、日本银行和加拿大银行。	Indeed, the ECB was among the first banks to reach an agreement with the Fed, followed by other major advanced-country central banks, including the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Canada.
但推动欧元区 — — 包括遭受危机冲击最严重的欧元区外围国家 — — 当前复苏的周期有可能会持续一段时间。	But the one driving today’s recovery in the eurozone, including the peripheral countries that were hardest hit by the crisis, may be set to persist for a while yet.
ampnbsp;ampnbsp;ampnbsp; 我提出这些世界面临的挑战的目的就是要表明，即使奥巴马和世界其他领导人步步为营，美国和全球经济还是会进入一个困难时期。	The point of reciting these challenges facing the world is to suggest that, even if Obama and other world leaders do everything right, the US and the global economy are in for a difficult period.
这些债务几乎肯定要被重组，但在放任这些银行盲目使用高杠杆并积累大量有毒金融衍生品之后，欧中央行现在对任何形式的债务重组和减记都开始持反对态度。	This debt almost surely needs to be restructured, but, having allowed the banks to leverage themselves beyond any level of prudence and load up on toxic derivatives, the ECB is now warning against any sort of restructuring or write-down.
但那些对武器削减持怀疑态度的人可不这样认为：在整个冷战期间，他们将美国对发展和部署核武器的限制视为对国家安全的出卖。	But arms-control skeptics take issue with this. Throughout the Cold War, they viewed restraints on America’s development and fielding of nuclear weapons as compromising national security.
虽然我们还不知道这个大型项目背后的确切动力是什么，但可以确信的是，通过更完善的基础设施来连接中国，欧洲一起其他地区的做法将对世界贸易产生重大的积极影响。	While we don’t yet know the precise dynamics of this grand project, it is safe to assume that linking China, Europe, and everywhere in between through better infrastructure will have a significant positive impact on world trade.
吉拉尼也好，辛格也罢，两人都无法确定本国人民是否支持改善双边关系，因此只能十分小心谨慎，而不是顺应当前的形势大胆作为。	Neither Gilani nor Singh was certain of domestic public support for further warming of relations, so they played it safe, rather than displaying the bold leadership that the occasion demanded.
当然，像挪威那样富裕的国家很少，但其中的原则 — — 包括照顾老人的支持 — — 可以适用于30周、40周或50周。	Of course, few countries are as wealthy as Norway; but the principle – including support for elder care – can be applied to 30-, 40-, or 50-week periods.
但3月下旬，由于担心货币走弱对通胀的影响，阿根廷央行再次开始干预，而且似乎将汇率固定在20比索兑一美元左右。	But in late March, concerned by the effect of a weakening currency on inflation, the central bank once again began intervening, and appeared to be fixing the exchange rate at around 20 pesos per dollar.
奥巴马应当充分利用印美私有部门的专业知识和能力，在气候变化、农业转型、教育和艾滋病毒/艾滋病等复杂的全球问题上建立起公－私合作的关系。	Obama should tap the expertise and energy in the Indian and American private sectors to foster public-private partnerships on complex global problems such as climate change, agricultural transformation, education and HIV/AIDS.
欧洲需要做出的努力就是构建一支由欧盟、土耳其和阿拉伯国家的军队组成的武���，在联合国的授命下进驻黎巴嫩和加沙。	What is needed is a European initiative that is backed by a credible military deterrent, consisting of forces from the EU, Turkey, and Arab countries, to be dispatched under a UN mandate to Lebanon and Gaza.
其内部受制于一个政治观点与欧洲长期进步不兼容的保守派别；在外部又受到最近声势日隆的极右翼德国新选择党（Alternative for Germany）制肘。	Internally, it is limited by a conservative wing defined by views that are not compatible with long-term progress in Europe. Externally, it is limited by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has lately grown in popularity.
更糟糕的是，为了防止选民基础被不断侵蚀，许多主流政党都开始仿效这些破坏性力量，参与到对欧盟的抨击之中。	Even worse, faced with an erosion of their voter base, many mainstream parties are playing catch-up with these destructive forces, engaging in EU-bashing of their own.
西班牙也陷入了严重的麻烦，因为其传统上拥有自主权的地方政府预算赤字太大、其银行太过疲软、其主权债务余额每年都必须大量展期。	Spain, too, is in serious trouble, owing to the budget deficits of its traditionally independent regional governments, the weakness of its banks, and its need to roll over large sovereign-debt balances each year.
且不论是对是错，俄罗斯和中国认为报复傲慢自大的西方世界的时机到了，因为它们认为自己在对利比亚进行“人道主义干涉”的真正意图上遭到了欺骗 — — 。	Rightly or wrongly, Russia and China believe that the time has come to take their revenge over an arrogant West that deceived them about the true purpose of “humanitarian intervention” in Libya.
作为第一步，针对政治人物和议会成员的所谓个人制裁应该取消，以便它们重新参与寻求双方都能接受的方案的过程。	As a first step, the so-called personal sanctions that affect political figures and parliamentarians should be lifted, so that they can rejoin the process of seeking mutually acceptable solutions.
其追随者信奉中世纪9世纪学说来证明自己竭尽全力重建哈里发，目的是让“酋长、团体、国家和组织的合法性全部失效 ” ， 并执行即刻处决和强制奴役。	Its adherents espouse a medieval ninth-century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate, in which “the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations becomes null” and summary execution and slavery are mandatory.
它们被锁定在一个不受欢迎的大联盟中，这样的意识形态再梳理将让政府越来越难以找到共同点，在联邦选举中体现出来。	Locked in an unpopular grand coalition, such an ideological realignment would make finding common ground in the government increasingly challenging and could well result in an early federal election.
埃尔多安本可利用这个机会去超越伊斯兰，自由主义，世俗主义和库尔德人的身份认知，围绕民主规范构建一个新的政治共识，有机会成为实现一个民主团结的领袖。	Erdoğan could have used the opportunity to rise beyond Islamist, liberal, secularist, and Kurdish identities to establish a new political consensus around democratic norms. He had a chance to become a democratic unifier.
但如果改革能够实施和维持，并且核协议能够避免强硬派的干扰，伊朗将能够与它的过去决裂，成为国际社会的正常成员。	But if reforms can be implemented and sustained, and if the nuclear deal can be protected from hardliners, Iran will be able to break free of its past and become a normal member of the international community.
11月的20国集团首脑会议首次邀请作为积极利益相关方的正在崛起的国家参加，大家一起探讨解决全球金融危机。	November’s G-20 summit brought to the table for the first time the rising powers as active stakeholders to address the global financial crisis.
伦敦—英国全国医保制度（National Health Service，NHS）迎来了70岁生日，这也是思考NHS过去和未来的良机。	LONDON – The United Kingdom’s National Health Service marked its 70th birthday this year, so this is a good time to reflect on the NHS’s past and consider its future.
但它手上只有1亿美元（假如上面的权利义务包括了美国银行的全部资产和负债 ） ， 将赔付AIG和花旗银行各5000万美元。	Having only $100 million (if these obligations are its only assets and liabilities), BofA would have to pay AIG and Citibank $50 million each.
在这种情况下，既然泛大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系协定的缔约方都是北美和欧洲的发达经济体，又为何需要附加上述条款呢？	In that case, it is unclear why ISDS provisions are needed for the TTIP, which covers the advanced economies of North America and Europe.
最后，艾哈迈迪内贾德在颠覆伊朗的稳定方面更为大胆，而他的胜利又会鼓励激进的伊朗官员和伊拉克的极端主义分子。	Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to be bolder in subverting stability in Iraq, and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and extremists within Iraq itself.
他已经愈发依赖于这一浅显的观点，那就是，由国家赞助的爱国主义和民族主义可以让中国迥异的各阶层连接在一起。	He has become increasingly reliant on the facile notion that state-sponsored patriotism and nationalism can hold China’s disparate groups together.
此时他被迫断绝了与这些被保护人的关系。 巴基斯坦的联合情报部门(ISI)建立了塔利班并且在关键性战役中指挥他们，而本拉登则在塔利班的统治下建立了安全老巢。	The Taliban, under whose rule Osama bin Laden had found a safe haven, had been created (and, in crucial battles, led) by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).
出口导向增长模式的亚洲经济体 — — 如越南（出口贡献了GDP的90 % ） 、马来西亚（71 % ） 和韩国（45 % ） — — 将遭受重创。	The Asian economies with export-dependent growth models – such as Vietnam (where exports constitute 90% of GDP), Malaysia (71%), and South Korea (45%) – would be hit particularly hard.
美国国务卿亨利·基辛格曾在1973年赎罪日战争后引导以色列与埃及和叙利亚签订了开创性的临时解决方案。	Secretary of State Henry Kissinger used it to lead Israel toward groundbreaking interim settlements with Egypt and Syria following the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
如果看一下援助资金的情况，我们会发现尽管发展援助在2005年增加到了1070亿美元，但是其中大部分增加的资金都是被安排给“特殊情况”的，比如债务免除以及援助伊拉克和阿富汗的资金。	If one considers the issue of aid flows, one finds that though development aid rose in 2005 to $107 billion, most of the increase was geared towards “special circumstances,” such as debt forgiveness and for Iraq and Afghanistan.
如果允许这样的通货膨胀继续并加深的话，可能很容易产生与该地区领导人努力避免的汇率升值一样的有害后果。	If this inflation is allowed to continue and deepen, it is likely to have effects easily as pernicious as the exchange-rate appreciation the region’s leaders are striving so hard to avoid.
12月，当卢布暴跌时，俄罗斯财政部 — — 它通过两家主权财富基金持有俄罗斯外汇储备的近一半1,690亿美元 — — 认为中央银行的干预不够充分。	When the ruble tumbled in December, the finance ministry – which holds almost half of Russia’s foreign reserves, $169 billion, in two sovereign-wealth funds – deemed the central bank’s intervention to be insufficient.
不错，如果巴基斯坦的局势进一步恶化，穆沙拉夫完全可以像他在十一月份所做的那样，再次被迫宣布国家进入紧急状态。	Indeed, Musharraf might be compelled to impose emergency rule again, as he did in November, should Pakistan’s stability further deteriorate.
人类社会一直认为，有些��物的价值远远超过了知识产权。 防止过度垄断权力的需要曾经导致了反托拉斯权威机构强制要求转让专利所有权（美国政府也曾对美国电话电报公司提出过同样的要求 ） 。	Society has always recognized that other values may trump intellectual property. The need to prevent excessive monopoly power has led anti-trust authorities to require compulsory licensing (as the US government did with the telephone company AT&T).
法德关系的力量就是皮萨尼-费里/恩德莱恩的方案所代表的 — — 并且可以在得到足够政治支持的情况下重新激活欧洲。	The power of that relationship is what the Pisani-Ferry/Enderlein initiative represents – and what could, with sufficient political support, revitalize Europe.
虽然这显然不是最好的办法，幸而一家独大的美国愿意且能够把这些国际机构拧成一股绳，使得各方依然能实现合作。	This was clearly never the best approach. But, with a hegemonic United States willing and able to hold international institutions together, cooperation remained viable.
在一次针对克林顿的亲信胡马·阿贝丁（Huma Abedin）的分居丈夫的单独调查期间，在他的笔记本电脑中发现数千封电子邮件。	Thousands of emails had been discovered on the laptop of the estranged husband of Clinton’s closest assistant, Huma Abedin, during a separate inquiry into his own activities.
当然，世界银行的下一任行长需要重建公信力并履行世行的承诺，与我们的国家伙伴同心协力为推进良好的治理而战。	The next president of the World Bank will, of course, need to rebuild credibility and deliver on the Bank’s promises to work vigorously with our country partners in the fight for good governance.
政府的政策未能解决潜藏的问题，而保护银行而非抵押贷款持有者的举措进一步加剧了美国富人和穷人之间的差距。	The administration’s policies failed to deal with the underlying problems, and by protecting the banks rather than mortgage holders, they exacerbated the gap between America’s haves and have-nots.
事实上，一份关于全球连通性如何影响经济增长的评估报告指出，通过更深入地与世界融合，巴西可以让其平均年GDP增长率提高1.25个百分点。	In fact, an assessment of how global connections affect economic growth suggests that, by pursuing deeper engagement with the world, Brazil could boost its average annual rate of GDP growth by up to 1.25 percentage points.
穆尔西的正义和公正党（Freedom and Justice Party，由穆斯林兄弟会创立）赢得多数，伊斯兰两大阵营加起来获得了约三分之二的选票。	Morsi’s Freedom and Justice Party, created by the Muslim Brotherhood, secured a plurality, and the two major Islamist blocs together received roughly two-thirds of the vote.
原因很简单：刚刚失去正常运作的BRCA1或BRCA2等位基因、并且很快将转变成肿瘤的细胞也是难以经受重组的。	The reason is simple: cells that have recently lost the functional BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele and that will later grow into tumors will also be unable to undergo recombination.
在21世纪的复杂全球经济下，长期持续的良好经济成效取决于一整套运作良好的机制，不可被一个单一领导人所左右。	In the complex global economy of the twenty-first century, sustained good economic performance requires a panoply of well-functioning institutions that do not fall within a single leader’s purview.
首先，争取人类尊严和对生命尊重的斗争如同任何一场人权斗争一样，受到民主社会全体成员的顽强推动，而个人为推动人权所付出的努力要远远超过国家。	First, the fight for human dignity and respect for life, as with any struggle for human rights, is set in motion and tenaciously pursued by members of civil society, by individuals more than by states.
马蒂厄上校是当前反起义正统方式的无名英雄：将针对目标国家的出兵规模降至最低，派遣人员主要是情报机构（如中央情报局）和“特别部队”人员。	Colonel Mathieu is the unsung hero of current counter-insurgency orthodoxy, which requires a minimum military presence in the target country, mainly of intelligence agencies like the CIA and “special forces.”
既然奥巴马将会出席，其他领导人不会放过与他分享自己对于越来越热的“毒品战败”话题的观点的机会。 这一反毒品计划最初由美国总统尼克松于1971年发起。	Because Obama will be present, other leaders may seize the opportunity to share with him their views on what is increasingly called the “failed war on drugs,” the anti-drug program originally launched by US President Richard Nixon in 1971.
这种状态随着1989年共产主义崩溃而达至巅峰，但是克服欧洲大陆历史性分裂的机遇现在需要重新定义欧洲计划。	This phase culminated with the collapse of communism in 1989, but the chance to overcome the Continent’s historical divisions now required a redefinition of the European project.
此外，镇压异见势力的决心也影响到了城市的中产阶层，不然的话他们可能是该领域安全部门改革的最强烈支持者。	Furthermore, the determination to crush dissent affects the urban middle classes, which might otherwise be the strongest proponents of security-sector reform in this area.
这些资金流的其中一部分是相当稳定的，因为它们主要用来满足国内家庭支出；但也有很大一部分是追求回报的机会主义投资。	Part of this flow is steady, because it supports families at home; but much of it is opportunistic investment seeking real returns.
但如果国际经济危机持续的时间超过了2010年的上半年则全盘皆输，哥伦比亚将在���个经济普遍萎缩的地区挣扎着寻找经济发展的出路。	But if the international crisis lasts longer than the first half of 2010, all bets are off, and Colombia will struggle to find its economic footing in a region devastated by generalized contraction.
自从荷兰在北海地区发现石油和天然气之后，整个国家就一直被不断上升的失业率和劳动力失去劳动能力的问题所困扰（许多找不到工作的人发现失去劳动能力救济要比失业救济更有利可图。	The Netherlands, after its discovery of North Sea gas and oil, found itself plagued with growing unemployment and workforce disability (many of those who could not get jobs found disability benefits to be more generous than unemployment benefits.)
事实上，马克龙已经跨入了西方“新政治”的未知领域，该领域不再完全由大规模中左及中右党派之间的竞争来界定。	In fact, Macron has taken a leap into the unknown of the West’s “new politics,” a terrain no longer defined entirely by competition between large center-right and center-left parties.
在全世界的许多家庭中，妇女是家庭水、食品和能源线条上的核心 — — 因此往往能第一手地了解到这方面的挑战和潜在解决方案。	In many homes around the world, women are at the heart of the household's nexus of water, food, and energy – and thus often know firsthand about the challenges and potential solutions in these areas.
在20世纪90年代的巴尔干战争中，在同一片土地上共同生活了几个世纪的社区以及从小一起长大、在同一间学校上学的个体之间激烈地打斗着。	In the Balkan wars of the 1990’s, communities that had shared the same landscapes for centuries, and individuals who grew up together and went to the same schools, fought one another ferociously.
而让人民涌向街头，让国家走向崩溃，让数百万人走出家园的愤怒背后正是对明晰的权利的渴望，包括保护财产的权利。	And much of the anger that drove people to the streets, led countries to the point of collapse, and drove millions from their homes was motivated by a desire for clear rights, including those protecting property.
随着货币政策的正常化 — — 美国已开始进入这一阶段 — — 无风险利率预期将上升至与稳定的通胀水平（2 % ） 相一致的水平，这反过来对应着一定水平的失业率。	As monetary policy normalizes – a process that has already begun in the United States – the risk-free rate is expected to rise to a level that is consistent with stable 2% inflation, which, in turn, corresponds with a level of unemployment.
在基于科学的国际发展项目的支持下，新成立的本地水管理委员会与国境线对面的哈萨克斯坦的一个类似的委员会进行着会议。	Supported by a science-based international development program, the newly created local water management council now meets with a similar council across the international border in Kazakhstan.
尽管中亚国家大体上与中俄关系良好，但也忌惮俄国的军事力量和中国的经济力量，担心形成牺牲它们利益的中俄主导权。	Although the region’s leaders generally enjoy good relations with both countries, they fear that Russian military and Chinese economic dominance could lead to the rise a Sino-Russian condominium at their expense.
而且，选用衡量不同国家同样一揽子商品服务价格的购买力平价数据，经济学家可以调整GDP，对生活水平得出更深入的认识。	And, by using purchasing power parity, which measures the cost of the same basket of goods and services in different countries, economists can adjust GDP to gain better insight into living standards.
中国的成功一直是由基于廉价劳动力的廉价出口、廉价银行资金支持的国有企业建设的基础设施以及土地销售提供资金的政府预算推动的。	China’s success has been driven by cheap exports based on cheap labor, infrastructure built by state enterprises with low-cost bank funding, and government budgets funded by land sales.
第一个局限显然已经不适用于发达经济体，而第二个局限无关紧要，因为目标不是激励人们去工作，而是让人们可以脱离工作生活。	The first objection is surely no longer true of the advanced economies, while the second is irrelevant, given that the goal is not to strengthen the incentive to work, but to enable people to live without work.
名义债券对于通胀的避险功能较弱，并且长期来看，未得到有效控制的可变现资产很容易受到金融秃鹫们的攻击。	Nominal bonds are not well hedged against inflation, and, over the long run, assets that are claims to cash without effective control are highly vulnerable to financial vultures.
中国领导人在十八届三中全会上明确指出，消除武断的条条控制能够让各大城市和地方根据自身的比较优势进一步发展。	As China’s leaders explicitly recognized at the Third Plenum, the removal of arbitrary tiao tiao controls can enable cities and local communities to evolve according to their own comparative advantages.
正如国务卿康多莉扎·赖斯在不久前的开罗讲话中谈到的那样 ， “ 自由和民主是战胜仇恨、分离和暴力的最有力的思想武器 。 ”	As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice put it in a recent speech in Cairo, “Freedom and democracy are the only ideas powerful enough to overcome hatred, division, and violence.”
DAC成立了一个难民和移民问题临时工作小组帮助确定出资者是否在正确的时间为它们所提供的援助制定了正确的针对目标。	It has established a Temporary Working Group on Refugees and Migration to help determine whether donors are targeting their assistance in the right way, in the right place, and at the right time.
但这一转变或废除了中国旧的斯大林主义经济体制的摧枯拉朽的过程却并没有和一个改变政治体制的过程相辅相成。	But the demolition process that has transformed or razed so many of China's old Stalinist economic institutions has not been matched by a demolition of stultifying political structures.
与之形成鲜明的对照，按照传统方法饲养的禽鸟可能比囚禁在狭小环境内性格压抑、基因相似的禽鸟具有更强的免疫力。	By contrast, birds that are reared by traditional methods are likely to have greater resistance to disease than the stressed, genetically similar birds kept in intensive confinement systems.
相比之下，其他地区经验 — — 涉及长期专制统治以及忽视长期存在的不满 — — 一直在煽动冲突的烈火。	By contrast, the rest of the region’s experiences – which involve a long history of autocratic governance and neglect of long-simmering grievances – have fanned the flames of conflict.
6月份，英国以退欧投票证明了这一点 — — 这一决定直接否认了留在欧盟符合英国的最佳利益这一经济共识。	The United Kingdom proved that in June, with its Brexit vote – a decision that directly defied the broad economic consensus that remaining within the European Union was in Britain’s best interest.
奇怪的是，重新翻开1948年档案的是以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡，他的目的是要求巴勒斯坦人承认以色列这个犹太国家。	Oddly, it was Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu who, by requesting that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, reopened the 1948 file.
根据一份最近发布的测算数据，美国从墨西哥进口的最终产品中有40％的增值来自美国；墨西哥贡献了30~40％的价值；其余由国外供应商提供。	According to a recent estimate, 40% of the value added to the final goods that the US imports from Mexico come from the US; Mexico contributes 30-40% of that value; the remainder is provided by foreign suppliers.
因此我们必须理解并增强总体恢复力 — — 系统应对各种 — — 全方位影响其运转的 — — 冲击的能力。	So we have to understand and enhance general resilience – a system’s capacity to cope with a variety of shocks, in all aspects of its functioning.
新技术正逐步消灭那些常规性的手工和中等认知技能工作，加剧了劳动收入的不平等，也是总体收入不平等的最重要来源。	New technologies are wiping out routine manual and cognitive middle-skill jobs, and exacerbating labor-income inequalities, the most important source of overall income inequalities.
我们还需要“措施”和“姿态”引导三分���一30岁以下人民和近一半的工业和服务业工人，据说他们通过给国民阵线投票来表达“沮丧”和“焦虑 ” 。	We will also need “efforts” and “gestures” directed toward the one-third of people under 30 and the nearly one-half of industrial and service workers who are said to have expressed their “frustration” and “anxiety” by voting for the FN.
对梅来讲，今后几个月的核心挑战将是在现实基础上确定在与欧盟关系（在贸易领域则涉及与世界关系）的艰苦谈判开始后英国的目标应当是什么？	For May, a central challenge over the next few months will be to determine what, realistically, Britain should be seeking when it begins the laborious negotiations on its relationship with Europe (and, on the trade front, with the world).
当执法部门和司法机构沦为有组织犯罪的鹰犬时，记者们就明白当他们挖掘那些威胁犯罪分子或腐败官员利益的报道时只能后果自负。	When law enforcement and the judiciary are in thrall to organized crime, journalists know that no one will protect them when they dig up stories threatening the interests of criminals or corrupt officials.
联合国环境规划署估算，按照当前粮食消费趋势，到2050年，必须让面积介于巴西和印度之间的土地转化为耕地。	The UN Environment Programme estimates that, by 2050, an area between the size of Brazil and India will have to be repurposed into cropland if current food-consumption trends continue.
这一战略可以追溯到文在寅所支持的、韩国实施了十年的“阳光政策 ” 。 前总统卢武铉采取这一方针与朝鲜周旋，但以失败告终。	The strategy harks back to the South Korea’s decade-old “Sunshine Policy,” former president Roh Moo-hyun’s unsuccessful outreach to the North, which Moon supported.
在维多利亚时代的伦敦，工程师约瑟夫·巴泽尔杰特修建了一套寿命长达150年的污水系统；现在才开始进行这套系统的扩建工程。	In Victorian London, the engineer Joseph Bazalgette built a sewage system with enough capacity to last for over 150 years; it is only now being expanded.
2月11日媒体又故伎重演 ： “ 民主党 . . 昨天批评布什总统的首席经济学家对美国工作流往海外的赞美之辞 . . .	It happened again on February 11: “Democrats...lit into President Bush’s chief economist yesterday for his laudatory statements on the movement of U.S. jobs abroad....
政府官僚喜欢走后门，隐瞒服务提供差距，夸大表现 ， （ 或者更糟糕地）在有机会的时候假公济私，这些都已是老生常谈。	It is a truism that government bureaucracies cut corners, hide gaps in service delivery, exaggerate performance, or, in the worst cases, simply steal when they can get away with it.
南韩演进中的对外政策可能也包括与中国走得更近。 韩国的民族主义者在对抗日本对东中国海和日本海的碳氢化合物储藏的所有权要求的过程中与中国人同声同气。	South Korea’s evolving foreign policy also may involve moving closer to China, as Korean nationalists join the Chinese in resisting Japan’s rival claims to potential hydrocarbon deposits in the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan.
东京—对日本领导人和日本人民来说，普京总统的悍然吞并克里米亚只不过是对俄罗斯历史常规范式的正常回归。	TOKYO – For Japanese leaders and citizens, President Vladimir Putin’s brutal annexation of Crimea was an unsurprising return to the normal paradigm of Russian history.
美联储与英格兰银行都将短期存款利息指标降低到了几乎零利息，并在采纳“定量放松 ” ， 也就是说连续不断地进行现金注入。	The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England lowered short-term interest-rate targets to near zero and are adopting “quantitative easing” – i.e., continuous infusions of money.
在此次宣告前，银行中持异议的成员向新闻界透露的消息就已经在公众心中播下了困惑的种子，不清楚银行的顾虑与意图何在。	Press leaks by dissident members had sowed confusion in the public’s mind as to the bank’s concerns and intentions before the announcement.
五星联盟肆无忌惮地侮辱和威胁那些对其提出批评的记者，而联盟党则不断丑化移民并纠缠那些向冒着生命危险穿越地中海前来避难的难民提供庇护的地方政府。	M5S goes out of its way to insult and threaten critical journalists, and the League disparages immigrants and badgers local governments that show hospitality toward asylum seekers who have risked their lives crossing the Mediterranean.
随着这一额外的刺激助推已经接近充分就业的经济，通胀必然会加速，而保护主义贸易关税和可能的“边境税”将更进一步推高进口商品价格。	As all this extra stimulus fuels an economy already nearing full employment, inflation seems bound to accelerate, with protectionist trade tariffs and a possible “border tax” raising prices even more for imported goods.
不采取补偿措施 — — 包括最好从幼儿时期就开始的学前教育 — — 机会不平等就会在儿童达到五岁时转化为一生结果的不平等。	Without compensatory measures – including pre-school education, ideally beginning at a very young age – unequal opportunities translate into unequal lifelong outcomes by the time children reach the age of five.
他希望通过对巴格达政权的改变可以将伊拉克民主化，从而使得周边的阿拉伯国家受到影响，迫使他们也向民主转型。	He expected regime change in Baghdad to lead to a democratic Iraq, a development that would in turn transform the region when people elsewhere in the Arab world saw this example and forced their own governments to follow suit.
我个人认为肥胖应当归咎于某些根深蒂固的人类本能，那就是乐于坐在那里猛吃高盐、高脂、高糖的零食，而不愿从事耗费体力的劳动。	I personally blame some hardwired human instinct for sitting around eating salty, greasy, sugary snacks in preference to hard physical labor.
具有讽刺意味的是，欧洲央行不得不提前更大幅度地降息，因为其通胀偏见正在让欧元升值到对于当前欧洲经济状况危险的水平。	Ironically, the ECB will have to cut interest rates sooner, and by greater amounts, because its inflationary bias is sending the euro to dangerous levels for the current state of its economy.
此外，尽管这样的指令在其他经历政治过渡的国家导致了独裁而不是民主，但没有一个国家存在破坏民主化进程的政治化的司法实体。	And, while such decrees have led to dictatorships, not democracies, in other countries undergoing political transition, none had a politicized judicial entity that played the role of spoiler in the democratization process.
我们会重写《利维坦 》 ， 或者殊途同归的《威斯特伐利亚和约 》 ， 而不必再次经历悲剧性的欧洲激进化并且酝酿或爆发世界大战吗？	Will we rewrite Leviathan or, what amounts to the same thing, the Peace of Westphalia, without this time having to pass through the tragic radicalization of Europe and the brewing or raging of world wars?
在倒台前夕，一些阿拉伯独裁者实际上一直被世界银行和国际货币基金组织（IMF）赞扬其在实施“正确的”经济政策方面的所谓的成功。	On the eve of their downfall, a few Arab autocrats were actually being lauded by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for their supposed success in adopting the “right” economic policies.
这些发现支持只有智人才有资格被认为是真正现代人的考古学观点，而尼安德特人等非现代人群体的复杂程度充其量只能称为雏形。	These discoveries support some archaeologists’ view that only Homo sapiens was advanced enough to be considered truly modern humans, while non-modern groups like the Neanderthals displayed, at best, only incipient signs of such complexity.
但双边贸易在2011—2012年期间只有184亿美元，远远不如中印贸易，和中日贸易相比更是不值一提。	But bilateral trade amounted to only $18.4 billion in 2011-2012 – far smaller than India-China trade and a pittance compared to Japan-China trade.
根据联合国发布的《2016年世界经济形势与展望》报告，这些国家在2015年的平均增长将只有3.8 ％ — —是2009年全球金融危机以来最低水平，萧条程度也跟2001年并无二致。	According to the UN report World Economic Situation and Prospects 2016, their growth averaged only 3.8% in 2015 – the lowest rate since the global financial crisis in 2009 and matched in this century only by the recessionary year of 2001.
最好的例子莫过于联合国气候变化委员会（IPCC ） ， 该委员会明确表示，总体干旱程度并未呈现上扬。	The best evidence comes from the United Nations’ climate change panel, the IPCC, which has clearly shown that there has been no overall increase in droughts.
一些国家，如英国、挪威、瑞典、韩国和澳大利亚，正在增加它们的外国援助预算；其他国家，如日本和荷兰，则在削减这一预算，尽管传统上它们是慷慨的援助者。	Some countries, like the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, and Australia, are increasing their foreign-aid budgets; others, even traditionally generous donors like Japan and the Netherlands, have reduced theirs.
20世纪70年代，美国对德、法、英发起的金融攻击（比如通过实现美元浮动）遭遇了欧洲统一机构的顽强抵抗。	In the 1970s, America’s financial assault on Germany, France, and Britain (for example, by floating the dollar) was met by a united European establishment.
某些公司一直拿不定主意将生产企业转移到国外还是中国内陆省份，而人民币升值会推动他们做出向国外转移的决定。	Some of these firms have been weighing whether to move production abroad or to inland provinces of China; revaluation could push them in the former direction.
《纽约时报》的口民调分析发现，年收入50,000美元以下的选民以十个百分点的优势支持克林顿，而年收入50,000美元以上的选民对两位候选人的支持不分伯仲。	A New York Times analysis of exit polls found that voters with annual incomes below $50,000 backed Clinton by about a ten-point margin, while voters with incomes above that level split evenly between the two candidates.
在特朗普手中，这种本来旨在缓解刑事司法“必要严酷性”的宪法权力正在被一位正式宣誓的官员用来支持残忍。	In Trump’s hands, a constitutional power intended to mitigate the “necessary severity” of criminal justice was deployed to sanction cruelty by a sworn officer of the law.
我们在埃及、土耳其、甚至叙利亚等国所看到的现象���伟大英国自由主义哲学家以赛亚·伯林所述同等善物不相容的典型代表。	What we see in countries such as Egypt and Turkey – and even in Syria – is what the great British liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin described as the incompatibility of equal goods.
有些人像往常一样阿拉伯与以色列之间的冲突是伊斯兰与西方社会之间矛盾的根源，而解决了巴勒斯坦的困难就能够大大地促进双方更加和睦的关系。	Some, as usual, will claim that the Arab-Israeli conflict lies at the root of the problems that exist between Islam and the West, and that resolving the Palestinians’ plight will contribute immensely to smoother relations.
而在其他国家，如希腊、意大利、保加利亚、匈牙利、爱沙尼亚、波兰、马来西亚、菲律宾和斯里兰卡，同样出现了超过10%的农业就业比重下降。	In others, like Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Estonia, Poland, Philippines, and Sri Lanka, the decline exceeded 10%.
“德拉吉说 ” — —即财力雄厚的欧洲央行将会尽一切努力挽救欧元和每一个危机国家 — — 似乎真地起了作用，至少在一段时间内是如此。	The “Draghi put” – the notion that the European Central Bank, with its deep pockets, would and could do whatever necessary to save the euro and each of the crisis countries – seemed to have worked, at least for a while.
美国农民布雷克·赫斯特提醒道 ： “ 即使采用全面养殖法混养作物野草也会不断生长，如果没有农药，就只能靠人工除草来保护作物 。 ”	American farmer Blake Hurst offers this reminder: “Weeds continue to grow, even in polycultures with holistic farming methods, and, without pesticides, hand weeding is the only way to protect a crop.”
全球有25亿人得不到周到的银行和金融服务，金融包容正是向他们提供参与正式金融系统的机会、从而帮助他们走出贫困、进入经济主流。	Financial inclusion is about providing an opportunity for the world’s 2.5 billion unbanked and financially underserved to participate in the formal financial system, thereby helping to lift them out of poverty and enter the economic mainstream.
但是，在下一个五年期间，这一数量下降到了26个，而在最近的期间（2000年到2004年 ） ， 只有21个。	In the next two five-year periods, however, the number fell to 26, and in the most recent period (2000-2004), there were only 21.
和平只有在冲突成为决议的成熟动因时才会到来，而要达到这一条件，冲突主角各方领导人都要拿出意愿和具备能力形成妥协。	Peace comes only when a conflict becomes ripe for resolution, which happens when the leaders of the principal protagonists are both willing and able to embrace compromise.
对于那些在2028年回顾今日的人来说，当欧洲政客开始放弃并缩减定向债权南北转移支付之时，从2018年开始的那十年将被铭记。	For those looking back in 2028, the decade starting in 2018 will be remembered as one when European politicians began to waive and abate the Target claims through north-to-south fiscal transfers.
去年11月，伊斯兰北非基地组织（AQIM）指挥官贝尔莫赫塔��Mokhtar Belmokhtar）证实，革命爆发时，AQIM曾抓住机会弄到了这批军火中的一部分。	Last November, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the commander of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), confirmed that AQIM seized the opportunity to secure some of this arsenal when the revolution started.
只有当资本金比率被大幅提高 — — 达到“震慑”的水平 — — 那些银行高管才会意识到在放宽监管指令的情况下，承担过度风险是不符合银行自身或其股东利益的。	Only if capital were increased substantially – to “shock and awe” levels – would the banks and their executives conclude, without regulatory instruction, that it is not in their or their stockholders’ interest to take on much risk.
此外，城市化的蔓延和其他非农业用地的增加减少了可以用于提高食品产量的耕地数量，与此同时有越来越多的农业用地却被用来生产食品之外的其他商品，比如生物燃料。	Moreover, growing urbanization and other non-agricultural uses of land have reduced acreage available for food production, while agricultural land is increasingly used to produce commodities other than food, such as bio-fuels.
腐败、收买选票、足球高官对国际特权的荒谬的渴望、昂首挺胸接受奖牌和花环 — — 所有这些都是意料中事。	The corruption, the vote-buying, the absurd thirst of soccer bosses for international prestige, the puffed-out chests festooned with medals and decorations – all of that is par for the course.
近期选举的获胜者中不乏来自传统社会地位低下阶层者，他们通过选票的力���获得了祖先想都不敢想象的地位。	Among the victors in recent elections have been people from traditionally underprivileged backgrounds who have risen through the power of the ballot to positions their forefathers could never have dreamed of.
哈马斯是否能获胜，以及巴勒斯坦人是否信任他们要取决于最终达成的停火的种类 — — 如果最终达成了正式停火协议的话。	Whether Hamas can claim a victory – and whether Palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of ceasefire that is eventually agreed, if a formal one is eventually agreed.
正如危机前的资金并非贷款人推到大众面前，如今贷款人也无法强迫负债深重的家庭借钱，也不能强迫企业在市场萎靡不振的情况下借钱扩张产能。	Just as lenders did not force money on the public before the crisis, so now they cannot force heavily indebted households to borrow, or businesses to seek loans to expand production when markets are flat or shrinking.
我们拥有来自盟国和其他友邦的明确而热烈的支持，包括所有东盟成员国、美国、澳大利亚、印度、英国、法国等。	We enjoy the explicit and enthusiastic support of our allies and other friendly countries, including every ASEAN member country and the United States, Australia, India, the United Kingdom, and France, among others.
由于政府决策程序极端不透明且小圈子作业，而政策执行的任务又委派给了不可靠的官僚机构，因为普京政治模式所无法避免的结果就是深层次和大面积的腐败。	With policymaking fully nontransparent and reduced to a very closed circle, and implementation delegated to an unaccountable bureaucracy, the inevitable result of Putin’s political model was pervasive corruption.
特别地，中国需要改革抑制房地产泡沫。 房地产泡沫的罪魁是找不到其他可盈利投资渠道的巨额储蓄和外国资本流入。	In particular, the reforms were needed to deflate an emerging property bubble resulting from huge savings and foreign capital inflows that had no other profitable investment outlet.
这些女性正是我们每个人都应该加以培养和支持的领袖人士，而不是用“中东根本不存在这样的女性”的谬论来忽略她们。	These women are exactly the kind of leaders that everyone should be cultivating and supporting, rather than overlooking because of a belief that they cannot exist in the Middle East.
而更令人担心的一点则是缺乏勇气：很显然许多觉得特朗普有问题的人都不愿发出自己的呼声，因为害怕自己（及其公司的股价）被称为推文攻击的对象。	Even more worrying was the lack of courage: it was clear that many of those who were concerned about Trump were afraid to raise their voices, lest they (and their companies’ share price) be targeted by a tweet.
人们可能会思考如果这意味着世界银行能有更多资源来促进贫穷国家的发展，那么这种类似浮士德与魔鬼交易的做法是否也值得一试。	One might wonder whether such a Faustian bargain could be worthwhile if it means that the World Bank has more resources to promote development in poor countries.
这一铁轨除了会明显让伊朗总统内贾德受益外，还将灵巧地削弱南高加索与西方的联系。 美国和欧洲花了十年时间培植这一联系。	Besides its obvious benefits to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s retrograde government, this will deftly weaken the South Caucasus’s links with the West, which the US and Europe have spent a decade fostering.
事实上，在我逗留该国期间，杰马伊斯兰党人告诉我，他们制定了一个30年计划要把伊斯兰教法引进到孟加拉国。	The Jamaat-e-Islami Party, indeed, told me during my stay that they had a 30-year agenda to introduce Sharia law into Bangladesh.
（事实上，欧盟建立的政治过程的名字 ， “ 新功能主义 ” （ neo-functionalism）之抽象和繁琐与“两国安全套主义”如出一辙。	(Indeed, the name of the political process by which the EU was to be constructed, “neo-functionalism,” was every bit as abstract and cumbersome as “two-state condominialism.”)
但老牌中国观察家比尔·奥佛霍尔特（Bill Overholt，他是第一批预言中国崛起的外国专家之一）在其新著《中国源于成功的危机 》 （ China’s Crisis of Success）中指出，中国的改革推动力是“恐惧和简单性 ” 。	Yet the veteran China watcher Bill Overholt – one of the first to predict China’s rise – argues in his latest book, China’s Crisis of Success, that the country’s reforms were driven by “fear and simplicity.”
而市场也已开始更多依赖美联储，要求得到更多的关注和支持（每当感到失望就开始大发脾气，类似的例子是一年之前 ） 。	And the markets have come to depend much more on the Fed, expecting more frequent attention and support from it (and throwing a short tantrum when they feel disappointed, as was the case a year ago).
乌克兰和叙利亚旷日持久的冲突暗示了美俄之间陷入新冷战，这些国家和其他地方的混乱局面正日益严重地影响到国家经济和安全机制。	Protracted conflicts in Ukraine and Syria hint at a new Cold War between the US and Russia, and the turmoil in those countries, as well as elsewhere, is increasingly disrupting national economies and security regimes.
在2009年的选举中，前进党（Kadima party）在奥尔默特的继任者利夫尼（Tzipi Livni）的领导下比利库德集团多赢得一个席位，但无法组建联合俄政府。	In the 2009 election, the Kadima party, under his successor, Tzipi Livni, received one seat more than Likud, but was unable to form a government coalition.
在基加利强势签署氢氟碳化物协议将推动上述工作的开展，为希望采用新技术但囿于目前财力不足的发展中国家提供资金支持。	A strong HFCs agreement in Kigali would add momentum to these efforts and provide financial support for developing countries that want to move to newer technologies but currently can’t afford it.
因为如果我们不这样做，那我们很可能将面临范围广泛的拖欠债务、银行控制以及保护主义，这样的结果可能会在未来数年造成这些国家以及全球经济的衰退。	The alternative is the prospect of widespread debt default, banking controls, and protectionism – an outcome that would set back these countries, and the global economy as a whole, for years to come.
发自北京 — — 虽然尚未到达警戒水平，但中国外汇管理局于四月公布的国际收支数字依然引发了外界的严重关注。	BEIJING – The balance-of-payments figures that China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) released in April should have triggered serious concern, if not alarm.
事实上，大部分日本人这一举动是由存在于俄罗斯政治DNA中的扩张主义基因决定的，而不是由普京本人或乌克兰危机的具体环境决定的。	Indeed, most Japanese regard the move as having been determined by some expansionist gene in Russia’s political DNA, rather than by Putin himself or the specifics of the Ukraine crisis.
安倍通过大规模开支计划来作为自身货币政策的开局，主要集中于维修和更换受2011年东日本地震影响的基础设施。	Abe began his fiscal policy with a substantial spending program, focused primarily on repairing and replacing infrastructure affected by the 2011 earthquake.
发自新德里 — — 1997年10月，当全球领导人齐聚挪威首都奥斯陆，共同为终结童工制度制定战略时，人们雄心万丈，为变革许下了坚定的承诺。	NEW DELHI – In October 1997, when global leaders gathered in Oslo to strategize how to end child labor, we brought a huge ambition and a deep commitment to change.
但在今年，中国选择不与印度共享这些数据，这削弱了印度洪水早期预警系统的效率 — — 在亚洲夏季季风时节也是如此。	Yet, this year, China decided to withhold such data from India, undermining the efficacy of India’s flood early-warning systems – during Asia’s summer monsoon season, no less.
在东方，中国的增长模式是不可持续的，如果投资不振情况期许而提振消费的改革来的太晚、力度太轻，则可能将于2013年陷入衰退。	In the east, China, its growth model unsustainable, could be underwater by 2013, as its investment bust continues and reforms intended to boost consumption are too little too late.
为了应对今天的挑战，我们必须充分发挥普通士兵的主观能动性，鼓励他们承担责任，还要训练他们接到通知后迅速有效的反应能力。	To meet today's threats, troops must be able to take individual responsibility and initiative, and need to be trained to react resourcefully and at a moment's notice.
卢旺达人将教会他们的国际客人们，在非洲，家庭是一个包罗万象的概念，而在卢旺达，一代人将下一代人全体都视为自己的孩子。	Rwandans will teach their international guests that in Africa, family is an all-encompassing concept, and that, in Rwanda, an entire generation treats the next as its own children.
在2008年危机爆发前的那几十年中，两党之间达成了广泛的共识，允许大型金融企业按照自身认为合适的方式行事。	In the decades leading up to the crisis of 2008, there was a broad bipartisan consensus in favor of allowing large financial firms to do as they saw fit.
欧盟机制的运作，包括欧洲央行、欧盟委员会以及稳定和增长公约等面临严重的批评，但是这些批评并非是以对于国家主权的怀旧的名义进行的。	The operation of European institutions – the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the Stability Pact – is facing severe criticism, but not in the name of a nostalgia for national sovereignty.
但美国的要求 — — 巴沙尔下台或被迫远离权力 — — 无济于事；事实上，这样的要求让美国边缘化的效果大于对巴沙尔。	But the US demand that Assad step down or be removed from power has not been helpful; indeed, it has marginalized the US more than it has Assad.
中国、美国和其他参与者不但在数据思维、隐私和国家主权等方面竞争，也在二十一世纪国际秩序的诸多愿景之间竞争。	China, the US, and other participants not only have competing ideas about data, privacy, and national sovereignty, but also divergent visions of what the twenty-first-century international order should look like.
显然，中国因为转向国内消费的再平衡而减速给一切全球大宗商品价格踩了刹车，2015年金属指数也剧烈下跌。	Certainly, a slowing China that is rebalancing toward domestic consumption has put a damper on all global commodity prices, with metal indices also falling sharply in 2015.
如果保护这一风险加权等价值所需要的银行资本比重为10 % ， 则银行只需要拿出2,000美元的资本就可以发起这笔贷款，其余198,000美元都是银行借来的。	If the amount of bank capital needed to protect that risk-weighted equivalent is 10%, then the bank requires just $2,000 of its own capital to fund the mortgage, $198,000 of which the bank itself borrows.
由于主要出口以美元计价而主要进口则以欧元计价，这种长期的结构性赤字几乎为西非法郎区经济带来毁灭性打击，不久可能又要发生第二次货币贬值。	With the bulk of their exports denominated in US dollars and their imports priced mainly in euros, chronic structural deficits have wrecked the Franc Zone economies, and the prospect of a second devaluation looms larger by the day.
肝脏线粒体无法处理能量的猛攻，只能动用很少使用的安全阀，即所谓的“脂肪再生 ” （ de novo lipogenesis ） ， 将多余的能量基础转变为肝脂肪。	The liver mitochondria could not keep up with the energy onslaught, and had no choice but to employ a little-used escape valve called “de novo lipogenesis” (new fat-making) to turn excess energy substrate into liver fat.
实际上，法国民众对于罗雅尔的能力和萨尔科奇的本性一直抱有疑虑是他在民意调查中大幅上升的原因。 他的支持率从竞选之初的7%上升到了现在的22 % 。	Indeed, persistent doubts among the French about Royal’s competence and Sarkozy’s character are the primary reasons for his dramatic rise in public opinion polls, from 7% support at the start of the campaign to 22% now.
华盛顿 — — 许多媒体分析人士已经正确认识到“假新闻”所带来的危害，但却往往会忽视这一现象对记者本身的意义。	WASHINGTON, DC – Many media analysts have rightly identified the dangers posed by “fake news,” but often overlook what the phenomenon means for journalists themselves.
或者存款可以是KKR大西洋金融公司发行的求购纸，而贷款可以是KKR大西洋投资组合中的债务抵押凭证次级抵押贷款等级块。	Or the deposits can be consumer paper issued by KKR Atlantic Financing, and the loans can be CDO sub-prime mortgage tranches that KKR Atlantic holds in its portfolio.
国家也颁布了一系列新法并建立了一个相当先进的法律框架来结束对妇女的歧视，其中包括一部能将任何针对妇女的暴力行为定罪的法律。	The country has enacted several new laws and established a fairly advanced legal framework to end discrimination against women, including a new law that criminalizes any act that results in violence against women.
除了架桥建屋和创造工具之外，工程师还可以通过开发能更快诊断疾病和提供医疗服务的手段来协助提高全球卫生保健质量以及降低患者负担。	Beyond building bridges and creating gadgets, engineers can help improve the quality and affordability of health care around the world, by developing faster methods for diagnosing diseases and delivering medical services.
跨国势力、国家和非国家行动者皆参与其中，它们的目标各异，有时甚至争锋相对，不存在维持现状的共同承诺。	Transnational forces, states, and non-state actors are all involved, and their goals are complex and sometimes contradictory, with no universal commitment to preserving the status quo.
这些基金将在最大程度上改善 — — 而不是削减 — — 在获得教育途径和教育质量上所普遍存在的全球性差距。	These funds would at best ameliorate – not eliminate – prevailing global disparities in educational access and quality.
在实施了八年的激进刺激后，发达经济体正在走出漫长的去杠杆化过程。 这一过程具有天然的需求侧增长抑制作用。	After eight years of aggressive stimulus, developed economies are emerging from an extended deleveraging phase that naturally suppressed growth from the demand side.
本月，中国两年内第五次否决了联合国制裁位于巴基斯坦的穆罕默德军头目阿扎尔（Masood Azhar）的制裁提案。 联合国在多年前便已将巴基斯坦军列为恐怖组织。	This month, China torpedoed, for the fifth time in two years, proposed UN sanctions on Masood Azhar, the Pakistan-based head of Jaish-e-Mohammed, which the UN designated as a terrorist outfit years ago.
欧盟若要取得成功，就必须追求由法国总统推出的政策，把停止战争作为头等大事并和以色列的对武力的过度使用保持距离。	For the EU to succeed, it must pursue the policy launched by the French Presidency, giving priority to stopping the war and distancing itself from Israel’s disproportionate use of force.
包括瑞典的Spotify、爱沙尼亚的Skype、以色列的Waze和最新涌现的中国的阿里巴巴等众多的国际创业公司都已被估值数十亿美元。	Many international startups – including Sweden’s Spotify, Estonia’s Skype, Israel’s Waze – and, most recently, China’s Alibaba – have gained billion-dollar valuations.
但他似乎也因为精英阶层可能将其视为粗俗暴发户而不满，他名下拥有荒诞的金色摩天楼，豪宅里摆放着全镀金的洛可可式椅子和吊灯。	And yet he, too, appears to seethe with resentment against the elites who might look down on him as an uncouth arriviste, with his absurd golden skyscrapers and rococo mansions full of gilded chairs and massive chandeliers.
上个月，在斯特拉斯堡欧洲议会全体会议上，欧盟委员会支持了我的让私人部门站出来、集中于发展项目的计划。	Last month, at a European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg, the European Commission threw its support behind my plan to put the private sector front and center in development projects.
对于其中一些女性来说，这个“短板”可以被视为优点，使她们可以在自己丈夫或父亲曾经的位置上塑造一个清白而纯洁，甚至是殉道者的形象。	For some, this “shortcoming” was seen as an advantage, enabling some of them to project an image of innocence and purity, even martyrdom, as they stood in the place of their deceased husbands or fathers.
而美联储新任监察副主席兰达尔·K·夸尔斯（Randal K. Quarles）的早期动向表明他很可能会在特朗普和财政部的支持下持续腐蚀金融保护措施（虽然目前为止布林纳德仍然留任 ） 。	And early indications from the Fed’s new vice chair for supervision, Randal K. Quarles, suggest the potential for a steady erosion of safeguards, cheered on by Trump and the Treasury Department. (Brainard remains on the Board, at least for now.)
）在美国的例子中，这一上限将大大影响中国、墨西哥、日本和德国，它们在2017年分别贡献了3,750亿、710亿、690亿和640亿美元的美国贸易赤字。	In the US case, this ceiling would largely affect China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany, which contributed $375 billion, $71 billion, $69 billion, and $64 billion, respectively, to the overall trade deficit in 2017.
相比之下，美国人均国民收入在1929年到达顶峰的四年后仍然停留在下降28％的水平，并且花了整整十年也无法重回这一高峰。	By contrast, four years after US per capita national income peaked in 1929, it was still down 28%, and would not return to its 1929 peak for a full decade.
特别是，英国脱离欧盟和苏格兰脱离英国将加剧北爱尔兰亲英国的统一党（Unionist）和想要加入爱尔兰的共和党（Republican）之间的对立。	In particular, Great Britain’s departure from the EU and Scotland’s departure from the UK would add to tensions in Northern Ireland between pro-UK Unionists and Republicans seeking to join Ireland.
对于非包容性挑战的诸多维度，我们已经有了许多专门的应对计划。 这些挑战既包括收入和财富不平等，也包括自动化、人工智能和工作的未来。	There are already many important initiatives dedicated to various dimensions of the inclusiveness challenge, which include not just income and wealth inequality, but also automation, artificial intelligence, and the future of work.
现在被特朗普选中替代即将退休的最高法院大法官安东尼·肯尼迪的布雷特·卡瓦诺的提名同样正处在随时可能被撤回的千钧一发的时刻。	And now the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s selection to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, is hanging by the slimmest of threads and could be withdrawn at any moment.
虽然某些领军人物依然不愿承认，但2007~2008年的全球金融危机已经使“理性预期”经济学颜面尽失，并使凯恩斯和哈耶克这两大理论重新回到了后发制人的擂台上。	The global economic collapse of 2007-2008 discredited “rational expectations” economics (though its high priests have yet to recognize this) and brought both Keynes and Hayek back into posthumous contention.
这次选举的结果表明，印度经济发展将不受干扰，继续保持已有高成长性，它将为改善贫穷人口的生活水准质量继续努力。	The result should help India to continue – not without occasional turbulence – its journey toward becoming a high-growth economy that raises the standard and quality of life for the poor.
但是，除非纽约的民粹主义新市长比尔·德布拉西奥（Bill de Blasio）想把银行赶出纽约，否则上述城市就不可能在短时间夺走华尔街的皇冠。	But, unless New York’s populist new mayor, Bill de Blasio, tries to run the banks out of town, Western sheriff-style, these cities do not seem likely to steal Wall Street’s crown anytime soon.
而去年12月又有一个欧洲极右翼政客代表团参观了西岸占领区的犹太人定居点，并确信这就是“犹太人的土地 ” ， 令东道主庆幸不已。	And, in December, a delegation of European far-right politicians toured Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank, pleasing their hosts by reassuring them that this was “Jewish land.”
为一场持续复苏构筑基础需要一些能巩固公共和私人部门资产负债表的措施，再结合旨在提高生产力并增加增长潜力的结构性改革。	Laying the foundations of a sustained recovery requires measures to strengthen public- and private-sector balance sheets, together with structural reforms aimed at raising productivity and improving growth potential.
在五页长的遗书中，特立帕提表示对于自己被迫学习工科感到沮丧，她真正的志向是成为一名美国宇航局（NASA）科学家。	In a five-page suicide note, Tripathi expressed her frustration at having been compelled to study engineering, when her real ambition was to become a NASA scientist.
这一决定只不过是确认了美联储并非对国际金融压力无动于衷，而且其风险管理手段仍然坚定倾向于“更低、更长期”的方针。	The Fed’s decision merely confirmed that it is not indifferent to international financial stress, and that its risk-management approach remains strongly biased in favor of “lower for longer.”
在一些例子中，民粹主义帮助扩大了特许权；带来了累进所得税和社会保险；构建了实体和人力资本；开放了经济；让充分就业成为重点；并鼓励了移民。	In some cases, populism has helped in extending the franchise; enacting a progressive income tax and social insurance; building physical and human capital; opening economies; prioritizing full employment; and encouraging migration.
这意味着朝鲜认为韩国会祈求它重开开城工业园是一种错误，开城工业园是2003到2009年双方关系缓和期北南双方最雄心勃勃的一项合作。	That means the North would be wrong to assume that the South will beg it to reopen the Kaesong Industrial Complex, one of the most ambitious North-South cooperative efforts of the 2003-2009 détente era.
昆塔莱利在与我的私人交流中表示，在历经六年的准备和辩论后，欧盟的《通用数据保护条例》将于5月25日生效，并“可以在某些方面起到指导作用 。 ”	In personal communications with me, Quintarelli says that the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which takes effect on May 25, following six years of preparation and debate, “can serve as guidance in some aspects.”
这并不是任何预先设想的行动计划的一部分，但是它却显示了只要有政治意愿，欧盟是可以在推动民主和稳定方面发挥积极作用的。	This was not part of any prefigured Action Plan, but it shows that, given the political will, the EU can play an active role in promoting democracy and stability.
总统奥巴马和国务卿希拉里·克林顿声称他们已经进入了“巧实力”的时代，这意味着他们将有效地采用一切外交手段去取得外交成果，文化外交当然也赫然在列。	President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton say that theirs will be an age of “smart power” that will effectively use all tools of diplomacy at their disposal, including cultural diplomacy.
比如，尽管大都市有望为工人和企业创造新机会，但它们无法解决气候变化等全球性问题，也无法管理国家和全球层面公共品的生产和保护。	For example, although megacities have the potential to create new opportunities for workers and businesses, they cannot solve universal problems like climate change or manage the production and protection of national and global public goods.
上周，反对派政治领袖、叶利钦政府副总理鲍里斯·涅姆佐夫（Boris Nemtsov）被杀，这早已不足为奇。	The murder last week of Boris Nemtsov, a leading opposition politician and a former deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, should come as no surprise.
接着，在上周，流亡沙特记者贾马尔·哈绍吉（Jamal Khashoggi）在来到沙特阿拉伯驻伊斯坦布尔领事馆办理离婚文件，以便在第二天与一位土耳其妇女结婚时失踪。	Then, last week, Jamal Khashoggi, an exiled Saudi journalist, vanished after entering Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul to obtain a document confirming his divorce, so that he could marry a Turkish woman the next day.
尽管2004年7月结束的财政年度里中国的消费价格指数上涨了5.3 % ， 但造成上涨的主要原因是食品价格居高不下，而无论此前还是此后，通货膨胀都小到可以忽略不计。	While China’s consumer price index rose 5.3% in the year ending in July 2004, this was due primarily to a spike in food prices; both before and since, inflation has been negligible.
鼓励一个经济体去挥霍其储蓄以及超前消费的政策使得贸易逆差成为一种宿命 — — 这种可能伴随着不择手段聚敛国外资本的讨价还价一同出现的，看似不公平的贸易操作也是如此。	Fostering policies that encourage an economy to squander its saving and live beyond its means makes trade deficits a given – as are the seemingly unfair trading practices that may come with this Faustian bargain for foreign capital.
随着以特朗普为代表的人物积极反对欧洲的努力并在全球经济互联水平要求加强规则制定的情况下反而支持放松监管，就更加凸显出欧洲的现状难以尽如人意。	This has become all the more true with figures like Trump actively working against its efforts and espousing deregulation at a time when the level of global economic interconnectedness demands just the opposite.
但是，要想获得建设性方案，各方都需要承认一些令人不快的事实 — — 并认识到今天的全球化与二十年前的全球化不是同一个现象。	In order to yield constructive solutions, however, all sides will need to concede some inconvenient truths – and to recognize that globalization is not the same phenomenon it was 20 years ago.
另一个值得关注的指标是h指数。 该指标由物理学家乔治·赫西（Jorge Hirsch）提出，旨在衡量学者的生产率和影响。	Another notable measure is the h-index – conceived by the physicist Jorge Hirsch – which aims to measure scholars’ productivity and impact.
亚太地区约占世界人口的55 % ， 全球年收入的44 % ， 但在安理会席位中仅仅占据20 % （ 15席中的3席 ） 。	The Asia-Pacific region accounts for roughly 55% of the world’s population and 44% of its annual income but has just 20% (three out of 15) of the seats on the Security Council.
然而，在经过了将近两个世纪的战争、政治和社会灾难以及非殖民化后，这种观念才至少是在理论上为全球所接受。	However, it took nearly two centuries of wars, political and social disasters, and decolonization before this idea became globally accepted, at least in theory.
作为在保护和扩展国际体系开放性上利益巨大的具有决定力的大国，德国有着帮助全球新大国融���这一体系的特殊责任。	As a shaping power with an enormous stake in preserving and extending the openness of the international system, Germany has a special responsibility to help integrate new global powers into that system.
国际社会应该谴责中国对南沙群岛的军事化，促使其改变策略，从而最大限度地避免爆发可能对海洋环境带来更多灾难性风险的冲突。	The international community should condemn China’s militarization of the Spratly Islands and urge it to reverse course, thereby minimizing the risk of a conflict that could be even more disastrous for the marine environment.
最糟的情况则可能是中国无视亲民主派在2007和2008年选举中的决定性胜利并继续坚持香港民众还没有准备好迎接民主的立场或宣称亲民主阵营被外来势力左右。	The worst case would be if China disregarded a decisive pro-democracy win in 2007 and 2008 and continued to insist that Hong Kong's people were unready for democracy or to allege foreign manipulation of the pro-democracy camp.
美国需要巧妙的方针，这也是我们在我们的新书《战略保证与决心 》 （ Strategic Reassurance and Resolve）中所述及的。	What is needed is a nuanced approach, which is what we develop in our new book Strategic Reassurance and Resolve.
目前，美国在全球教育和军事相关项目上的开支非常不平衡：前者每年要花10亿美元，后者则高达9,000亿美元。	The current imbalance in US spending on global education and military-related programs is staggering: $1 billion per year on the former, and roughly $900 billion on the latter.
但巴勒斯坦人的情况却恰恰相反：以难民困境为核心的离散族群思想一直是巴勒斯坦事业的心脏和民族运动决策的核心。	But the situation was reversed in the case of the Palestinians: the ethos of the diaspora, with the plight of the refugees at its center, has been the beating heart of the Palestinian cause and the focus of decision making for the national movement.
如今问题在于总统对北约的看法是否适用于国际货币基金组织（WTO ） ， 世界银行，世界贸易组织和巴塞尔银行监督委员会。	The question now is whether what is true for NATO is also true for the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
直到今天 ， 《 世界人权宣言》依然是跨越民族、意识形态和文化分野来探讨道德价值观的唯一一个最重要的基准点。	To this day, the Universal Declaration remains the single most important reference point for discussion of ethical values across national, ideological, and cultural divides.
但几乎委员会所有共和党人都准备迅速推进他的提名：尽管他算不上一个受欢迎的选择，但他却得到了共和党选民的支持，包括绝大部分基督教右翼人士。	But almost all of the Republicans on the committee were prepared to push his nomination through quickly: though he was an unpopular choice, he had the support of the Republican base, including much of the Christian right.
事实上，美国在20世纪60年代的经验应该成为欧元区创立者的警告：束缚国家货币当局的双手也许并不是出色的主意。	In fact, America’s experience in the 1960s should have warned the eurozone’s creators that tying national monetary authorities’ hands might not be such a good idea.
由此可以推断出一个市场观点：苹果公司不仅能够持续创新，同时也能抵御来自任何对手的竞争，投资者们将该公司的股票价格推到了一个令人眩晕的高度。	Extrapolating this into a market view that Apple could not only innovate continuously, but also fend off any and all competitors, investors took the company’s share price to dizzying heights.
事实上，牛津大学教授Pavlos Eleftheriadis最近对某希腊选民的评论应该引起亚洲领导人的注意 ： “ 对接受不诚实地引发问题的人领导怒不可遏 ” 。	Indeed, they should heed a recent comment by Oxford University’s Pavlos Eleftheriadis about a Greek electorate “livid at being led by those who dishonestly caused the problem.”
之后，美国与让-贝尔特朗·阿里斯蒂德长达15年的破坏性关系开始了。 阿里斯蒂德深受海地穷人的爱戴，但为大多数商人和美国许多著名的政治人物所猜忌。	The US then entered into a destructive 15-year relationship with Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is massively popular among Haiti’s poor, but distrusted by most of the business sector and many leading US politicians.
这种想法的错误性可以从那些利用美国声誉和影响力的削弱来大肆捞取利益的人身上可以看出来，从俄罗斯的弗拉基米尔·普京、委内瑞拉的雨果·查维斯，到伊朗的艾哈迈迪·内贾德和津巴布韦的罗伯特·穆加贝。	That this is untrue is demonstrated by those, from Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez to Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, who are exploiting America’s loss of standing and influence.
与此同时，美国在英国的帮助下，制定了一套1945年后的新国际秩序，这套秩序基于自由贸易、超国家机构，以及（至少在理论上）对自由民主的推动。	At the same time, the United States, with the help of Britain, set up a new international order after 1945, based on free trade, supranational institutions, and, in theory at least, the promotion of liberal democracy.
具体方案是与六所试点学校合作，包括阿拉伯联合酋长国的一所中学、美国和欧洲的几所高中以及接收叙利亚难民学生的一所黎巴嫩初中。	The proposal is to work with some half-dozen pilot schools, including a secondary school in the United Arab Emirates, high schools in the US and Europe, and a secondary school in Lebanon that is taking in Syrian refugee students.
与此同时，如果保守党想将此作为重议众多欧洲条约的第一步，那么他们将有可能失去解决一个关键问题 — — 改革欧元区和非欧元区欧盟成员国关系 — — 的机会。	In the meantime, the Tories risk losing their way on a crucial issue – reform of the relationship between the eurozone and non-euro EU members – if they try to use it as leverage to renegotiate the various European treaties.
巴黎—马里是一个西非内陆国家，有1 500万人口，1 240 000平方公里领土，其中四分之三是沙漠。	PARIS – Mali is a landlocked West African country of 15 million people, covering 1,240,000 square kilometers (478,800 square miles), three-quarters of it desert.
但我同时也可以忍受他们说“我们担心如果我们等待太久，我们将不得不过快过剧烈地收紧（货币政策 ） 。 ”	But I also could live with, “We are worried that if we wait too long, we will have to tighten too hard and too fast.”
在他们对人性的嘲讽模仿中，唐吉诃德和桑丘·潘沙成为了世界文学中生命最为持久同时也是最受喜爱的一对小丑。	In their burlesque approach to humanity, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are the most enduring and endearing clownish couple in world literature.
我们或许会认为进化导致那些只为自身利益考虑的个体 — — 以及他们的亲族 — — 才能被筛选留存下来，因为携带这类特性的基因更可能开枝散叶。	We might think that evolution leads to the selection of individuals who think only of their own interests, and those of their kin, because genes for such traits would be more likely to spread.
即将实施三项大规模增税政策： 600,000多农民将被要求补缴2014年税款，并预缴50%以上的来年预估税赋。	Three highlight the tax avalanche that awaits: More than 600,000 farmers will be asked to pay additional back taxes for 2014 and to pre-pay over 50% of next year’s estimated tax.
欧洲央行知道，其声称的ELA贷款是有抵押贷款的说法并不可靠，因为其中大量抵押品评级低于BBB - ， 因此不属于投资级。	It knows that its argument that the ELA loans are collateralized is wearing thin, given that, in many cases, the collateral has a rating below BBB-, thus falling short of investment grade.
从这个意义上讲，那些女性劳动参与率较低（如意大利）或最有经验的65岁以上劳动者不再工作的国家（如意大利和法国）均呈现出明显的劣势。	In this sense, countries with low female labor-force participation (like Italy) or where the most experienced workers, those over age 65, no longer work (like Italy and France) are at a distinct disadvantage.
由于认定联邦紧急措施署属于“过度膨胀的福利项目”以及 “政府的职能不是提供服务 ” ， 布什任命的首位联邦紧急措施署署长制定了新的外包计划，开始了全面的私有化进程。	Believing FEMA to be an “oversized entitlement program” and that the “business of government is not to provide services,” Bush’s first FEMA director instituted new outsourcing requirements as part of a major privatization effort.
总而言之，自动化会降低那些低工资重复性工作对中低技能劳动力的需求，同时增加了对高技能，高收入劳动力的需求，因为后者可以执行需要技术和问题解决技能的抽象任务。	On balance, automation reduces demand for low- and middle-skill labor in lower-paying routine tasks, while increasing demand for high-skill, high-earning labor performing abstract tasks that require technical and problem-solving skills.
它把罪犯当成人来看待，把他们当做有责任感、有廉耻心的主体，我们要做的是把他们重新纳入社会，而不是就此排斥在外。	It regards the offender as a person, as a subject with a sense of responsibility and a sense of shame, who needs to be reintegrated into the community and not ostracised.
总的来说，首要事项必须是改善经济和政策基本面，以便更好地验证现有的高资产价格，同时为更大的收益打下基础。	In general, the top priority must be improvement in economic and policy fundamentals to the point that they better validate existing elevated asset prices, while laying a foundation for greater gains over time.
可是，尽管从某些角度看目前的危机至少部分来源于金融创新，但事实却证明金融市场自由化从整体上看仍然利大于弊。	But, while it does sometimes appear that the current crisis is due, at least in part, to financial innovation, financial-market liberalization has been shown to be a good thing overall.
可以想象，虽然中国政府在这方面的态度会随着中国逐渐成为新技术的开发者而发生变化，而私有财产的神圣性在中国国家社会主义制度中一直受限。	While one can imagine the Chinese government’s attitude changing as the country becomes a developer of new technology, the sanctity of private property has always been limited in China’s state socialist system.
这一方案与产品和劳动力市场的提振增长的改革相结合，能产生持续性供给端效益（通过减税）和有助于欧元区增长复苏的暂时性需求提振。	Combined with pro-growth reforms of product and labor markets, such a program could yield both lasting supply-side benefits (through lower taxation) and a temporary demand boost that would help to revive eurozone growth.
我自己的猜测是 — — 我在会上警告我很有可能是错的 — — 美国能够在特朗普下台后恢复期领导力，如果它能够重温与他人一起运用实力和用实力凌驾于他人的教训的话。	My own guess, which I warned the group might be wrong, is that the US can recover its leadership after the Trump years if it relearns the lessons of using power with others as well as over others.
有了哈梅内伊的支持，鲁哈尼能够以他的务实派前任拉夫桑贾尼和哈塔米无法做到的方式驾驭伊朗权力格局中的顽固派。	With Khamenei’s support, Rouhani will be able to rein in recalcitrant forces in Iran’s power structure in a way that his pragmatic predecessors, Rafsanjani and Khatami, could not.
鉴于这些投资人管理着120万亿美元左右的资产，因此产生制约作用的瓶颈绝不是缺乏资金，而是缺少准备充分且值得投资的项目。	Given that these investors have some $120 trillion in assets under management, the bottleneck is not a shortage of capital, but rather a dearth of well-prepared, bankable projects.
它或许可以组织实施全球范围内的监督和报告 — — 即统计发病和死亡人数 — — 但它的政策作用应该受到严格的限制。	It may be able to perform and report worldwide surveillance – i.e., count numbers of cases and fatalities – but its policy role should be drastically reduced.
关于俄经济的旧病复发，在学术界，研究对外政策的学究们和受过教育的投资者中引发了一场争论：是否增加新的国家进入新兴市场国家名单之中。	In all of these revisions, Russia survives, despite the writing on its economic wall.
但尽管在布什政府开始时大幅削减了所得税边际税率，但2000年到2007年间的就业增长仅为前30年速度的一半。	Despite large cuts in marginal income-tax rates at the start of the Bush administration, however, job growth between 2000 and 2007 was half the rate of the previous three decades.
与此同时，正如人们在雅瑟·阿拉法特（Yasir Arafat）的巴勒斯坦政权中亲眼所见，一个腐败的政府促使人们变成极端伊斯兰主义分子，这些人为塑造诚实的形象耗费了巨大的努力。	At the same time, as was seen in Yasir Arafat’s Palestine Authority, a corrupt regime encourages people to turn to radical Islamists, who work hard to present themselves as honest.
我们这类担心美联储的手段导致美国经济困境极大恶化并导致其周期性失业转变为持久性长期结构性非就业的人们已经在其国内货币政策讨论中败下阵来。	Those of us who fear that the Fed’s approach has greatly deepened the US economy’s malaise and is turning America’s cyclical unemployment into permanent long-term structural non-employment have lost the domestic monetary-policy argument.
这都需要有效的领导，但虽然各国政府间的合作有助于推动一些气候行动，可国际社会日益碎片化的局面使这一手段的局限性日益凸显。	This will require effective leadership. But, while collaboration among governments has helped drive some climate action, growing fragmentation within the international community has made the limits of this approach clear.
对俄罗斯来说，北极地区永远是至关重要的战略要地，贡献了俄罗斯天然气产量（主要基于西西伯利亚）的约85 % 。	The Arctic region has always been strategically vital for Russia, accounting for roughly 85% of Russia’s natural-gas production, which is based primarily in Western Siberia.
一方面，这种集中化的经济力量使得各国更加难以实现工业化，因为当地公司无法指望与那些成熟跨国企业竞争。	For one thing, such concentrated economic power makes it more difficult for countries to industrialize, because local companies cannot expect to compete with established multinationals.
事实上，有一个重要得多的问题应该成为英国关于欧盟的争论的主要焦点：英国作为非欧元区国家在欧盟内部的未来地位。	In fact, there is a far more important issue that should serve as the main focus of the British debate on the EU: the UK’s future status inside the EU as a non-member of the eurozone.
由此带来的战略空白创造出由其他某种全球势力接过领导责任的机遇 — — 事实上也是一种不顾一切的必需。	The resulting strategic lacuna creates an opportunity – indeed, a desperate need – for some other global actor to take up the mantle of leadership.
迪顿的书所提出的最重要的事实是，最近几十年中，生活在发展中世界的数十亿人（特别是在亚洲 ） ， 名符其实地逃脱了令人绝望的贫困。	The overarching fact in Deaton’s book is that over the last few decades, several billion people in the developing world, particularly in Asia, have escaped truly desperate levels of poverty.
这个美国政策可能的进步的结果是，压力会转移到其他国家，特别是中国和印度，迫使它们接受对自身的经济行为的一些限制。	One result of this likely evolution in US policy is that pressure will shift to other countries, particularly China and India, to accept some limits on their own economic behavior.
此举减少了约3亿吨美国二氧化碳排放 — — 超过全世界所有风能及太阳能减排的总和 — — 同时还为美国人节省了能源开支1000亿美元。	This has cut about 300 million tons of US emissions – more than all the world’s solar and wind power combined – and at the same time has profited Americans by saving them $100 billion in energy costs.
欧盟委员会接受了改革，此后又进行了几次变革，每一次都骄傲地宣布SGP比以往更加“灵活”和“智能 ” 。	The Commission accepted the reform, and has since made several additional changes, each time proudly declaring that the SGP is more “flexible” and “intelligent” than ever.
中国正在走自己的路，仍有待证明集中化的制度能够比任何人所想象的更快更深地推动发展，远不止于成为一个增长的中等收入国家。	China is following its own path and may yet prove that centralized systems can push development further and faster than anyone had imagined, far beyond simply being a growing middle-income country.
发现之一是过多地看电视会让人变得被动，无论从神经还是行为反应上都是如此。 它会影响人们学习新知识，影响他们参与政治活动。	Among the many findings is that watching too much television induces passivity, both at the level of neural functioning and of behavior and that it interferes with learning and reduces political and civic participation.
如果民主党人足够聪明，他们应当遏制住自己的仇视情绪，并认识到特朗普在反移民共和党人一方享有的信誉使其处于达成两党合作的理想位置。	If the Democrats were smart, they would curb their detestation, and recognize that Trump’s credibility with anti-immigration Republicans puts him in an ideal position to negotiate a bipartisan package.
外国投资者们已经开始重新分配他们的投资组合，将货币转换成欧元、英镑，甚至是新兴市场国家货币例如巴西的雷亚尔和南非的兰特。	Foreign investors are already reshuffling their portfolios, moving into euros, pounds, and even emerging-market currencies like the Brazilian real and the South African rand.
按照澳大利亚旅游出口委员会总裁马修·辛格提的说法，世卫组织的流行病公告给该国造成了数千名旅游者的损失。	According to Matthew Hingerty, the managing director of Australia’s Tourism Export Council, the country lost thousands of tourists because of the WHO’s pandemic declaration.
五十年前，全国民事骚乱咨询委员会（人称克纳委员会）发表一份报告，毫不留情地描述出了骚乱背后的美国社会状况。	Fifty years ago, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (more widely known as the Kerner Commission), issued its report, providing a stark account of the conditions in America that had led to the disorders.
今天的决策者应该重申这一基本任务，唯有让创新匹配文明社会的当务之急，我们才能让医疗保健再上一个台阶。	Today’s policymakers should reaffirm that basic mission. Only by aligning innovation with the priorities of a civilized society can we finally take health care to the next frontier.
就连在1997年协议实行的特别一次性SDR的发行，由于反对派的阻力也至今尚未实行。 这次发行的目的本是为了确保该组织的成员国都能获得一份“公正”的累计SDR分配。	Even the special one-time issuance of SDR’s, agreed upon in 1997 to ensure that all Fund members receive an “equitable” share of cumulative SDR allocations, has still not been activated, owing to insurmountable opposition.
举例来讲，德国不久前提出把实现欧洲共同目标的开支－比如支持生产率提高的里斯本议程所需的研发经费从赤字中排除出去。	For example, Germany recently proposed that expenditures undertaken to meet European commitments – such as Rampamp;D spending to support the Lisbon agenda of enhanced productivity – be exempted.
也许更重要的是，如果美国能够与伊朗展开谈判，达成叙利亚问题和平协议的可能性也会大大增加 — — 伊朗对叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的作用远大于俄罗斯。	Perhaps most important, a peace settlement in Syria would be much more likely – and more likely to endure – if the US could talk to Iran, which has far more leverage with President Bashar al-Assad’s regime than Russia does.
举例来讲，新生效的以色列器官移植法鼓励人们签署器官捐赠卡，并承诺签署捐赠卡的人可以在等待移植时受到照顾。	For example, the new Israeli transplant law provides incentives for people to sign a donor card by giving them and their relatives priority on transplant waiting lists.
一开始时这不过意味着一种买卖书籍、收藏品的新方法；到如今电子商务已经无处不在，向客户出售各类全新和二手商品，同时成为物流和零售领域的一股全球性力量。	In the beginning, that meant new ways of buying and selling books and collectibles; but now e-commerce is everywhere, offering customers new goods and used goods – and becoming a global force in logistics and retail.
此外他们每千居民中科学家、工程师和技术人员的数量少于10人，全球均值为40人 — — 发达国家更是高达140人。	They also have fewer than ten scientists, engineers, and technicians per thousand residents, compared to the global average of 40 – and 140 in the developed world.
允许环境问题在当前这一地缘政治和社会动荡期半途而废是一个错误，这不仅是因为目前恰恰是管理气候变化之战的关键时期。	Allowing environmental issues to fall by the wayside at this time of geopolitical and social instability is a mistake, and not just because this happens to be a critical moment in the fight to manage climate change.
如果英国成为除俄罗斯之外仅有的自绝于欧盟单一市场的欧洲国家，其就不可能获得经济成功，不管人民怎么投票。	If Britain becomes the only European country apart from Russia to exclude itself from the EU single market, it will not succeed economically, regardless of how people vote.
结果，伊朗觉得必须做出回应 — — 包括但不限于袭击英国大使馆：袭击发生前几天，伊朗议会以多数通过将伊朗同英国的外交关系级别降格。	As a result, Iran felt compelled to respond – and not solely with the assault on the British embassy: a few days prior to the attack, a majority in the Iranian parliament voted to downgrade the country’s diplomatic relations with Britain.
与此形成对比的是，2000—2014年，中国对印投资只有4亿美元，占印度流入外国投资的0.18 % 。	This compares with just $400 million, or 0.18% of India’s inward foreign investment, in Chinese investment from 2000 to 2014.
虽然这个细菌的绝大部分结构都是复制自另一个天然细菌，但创造者向其基因组中嵌入了一组特别的DNA序列来证明它不是一个自然产物。	Although it is very similar to a natural bacterium from which it was largely copied, the creators put distinctive strings of DNA into its genome to prove that it is not a natural object.
起初，土耳其似乎支持叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德领导的阿拉维派，其后又转变立场加入逊尼派阿拉伯国家联盟，参与了迄今为止消灭阿萨德的灾难性努力。	At first, Turkey seemed to support Syria’s Alawite leadership under President Bashar al-Assad, then switched sides, joining a coalition of Sunni Arab states in the so-far disastrous effort to remove Assad.
然而我们并没有被告知，在过去40年间 — — 当气温同样在上升的时候 — — 全球北极熊的数量从5000只增加到了25000只。	We are not told, however, that over the past 40 years – while temperatures have risen – the global polar bear population has increased from 5,000 to 25,000.
伦敦—1923年，凯恩斯提出了一个至今仍有意义的经济学基本问题 ： “ 通货膨胀和通货紧缩是不恰当的 ， ” 他写道 ， “ 在这两个东西中，也许通缩 … … 更加糟糕；因为引起失业比令食租者失望 … … 更糟糕。	"LONDON – In 1923, John Maynard Keynes addressed a fundamental economic question that remains valid today. “[I]nflation is unjust and deflation is inexpedient,"" he wrote."
中国的第一艘航空母舰可能投入现役。 日本参与到演进中的亚洲安全框架中来，对于地区的稳定具有根本性的意义。	At a time of regional uncertainty about North Korea and China – including the looming prospect of China’s first aircraft carrier – Japan’s participation in the evolving Asian security framework is fundamental to stability.
公平地讲，没有任何一位联合国秘书长对人权运动理想的尊重超过了科菲·安南，也没有任何人比安南更愿意把人权理想与联合国运作结合在一起，哪怕这种结合仅仅停留在口头上。	In fairness, no UN Secretary General has paid greater homage to the ideals of the human-rights movement, or attempted, at least rhetorically, to associate the UN with those ideals, than Kofi Annan.
最新研究显示这会对极端气候事件，水供应，作物产量，珊瑚礁退化，以及海平面上升产生极大且可以测量的影响。	As the latest research shows, it would have a dramatic and measurable impact on extreme weather events, water availability, crop yields, coral-reef degradation, and sea-level rise.
发自纽约 — — 十五年前我写过一本名为《​​全球化及其不满情绪》的小书，描述发​​展中国家对全球化改革越来越强烈的抵抗情绪。	NEW YORK – Fifteen years ago, I wrote a little book, entitled Globalization and its Discontents, describing growing opposition in the developing world to globalizing reforms.
一个协调就业市场变化与我们的生活经验和这些统计数字的办法是注意到我们生产的许多东西与我们过去所制造的东西区别很大。	One way to reconcile the changes in the job market with our lived experience and statistics like these is to note that much of what we are producing is very different from what we have made in the past.
目前，俄罗斯威胁，如果乌克兰不屈从于俄罗斯的国有天然气公司GAZPROM的要价，它就会切断乌克兰的天然气供应。 因此，施罗德明显的道德错误就更为严重了。	His apparent ethical lapse is magnified by the fact that, at this very moment, Russia is threatening to cut off Ukraine’s gas supplies if that country does not give in to the pricing demands of Kremlin’s state-owned gas behemoth, Gazprom.
过去的经验让中国的实体工程师明白，摆脱通缩的唯一办法是通过痛苦的结构改革 — — 而不是宽松的货币和竞争性贬值。 问题在于美国和其他储备货币国是否会共同承担维持全球货币稳定的负担。	Past experience has taught China’s real engineers that the only way to escape deflation is through painful structural reforms – not easy money and competitive devaluation.
迪拜—1906年9月，来自伊朗、伊拉克、科威特、沙特阿拉伯和委内瑞拉的代表齐聚巴格达，组成了石油输出国组织（欧佩克 ） 。	DUBAI – In September 1960, delegates from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela met in Baghdad to form the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
更恐怖的是，许多发达经济体对财政赤字货币化开始习以为常了，其央行已大量购买短期、长期政府票据，使货币基数猛增。	More ominously, monetization of these fiscal deficits is becoming a pattern in many advanced economies, as central banks have started to swell the monetary base via massive purchases of short- and long-term government paper.
但一个日益明显的倾向是做好执政四年的计划，从而领导人不再将立法时期用于法律争论，而是用于实施此前形成一致的政策。	But there is a growing tendency to plan out four years of governing, with leaders then using legislative periods not to debate laws, but rather to enact previously agreed policies.
布特的反应，还有他的其他说服之道，指出了一个真实的困境。 这一困境总是发生在极权体制之下，而这些体制采用一些民主的假象来支持它们的合法性。	The reaction of Boot, and others of his persuasion, points to a genuine dilemma that always occurs in authoritarian systems that use some semblance of democracy to bolster their legitimacy.
在马哈茂德·阿巴斯领导下的巴勒斯坦政权就更虚弱了，它已经在去年哈马斯暴力暴动之后失去了对加沙的控制权。	The Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas is even weaker, having lost control of Gaza to Hamas after a violent putsch last year.
预计这种交通工具的全球市场在一万亿美元上下，而它们的运用将会通过建立三百公里的“通勤线”以及节省修建道路和桥梁的巨额费用而削弱定期的国内航班客户基础。	The estimated worldwide market for such vehicles is in the range of $1 trillion, and their use would erode the scheduled domestic airline customer base by enabling 300 kilometer “commutes” and providing huge cost avoidance for roads and bridges.
接着，在1鱼粉，五家主要电视台因为在去年地方选举期间转播法律和人权中心（Legal and Human Rights Center）的有关可能存在侵犯权利现象的言论而被罚款。	Then, in January, five prominent television stations were fined for airing a statement by the Legal and Human Rights Center regarding possible rights violations during local elections last year.
更令人震惊的是法国保证西非法郎与硬通货自由兑换，但最初的条件是所有15个法郎区国家向法国财政部100%上缴本国的外汇储备。	More appalling is the fact that France guarantees the CFA franc’s free convertibility into hard currency, originally on the condition that all 15 Franc Zone countries surrender 100% of their foreign reserves to the French Treasury.
而在接下来的几年里，全世界对这一基本矛盾的解决方法将会对经济增长、就业率、收入分配及全球经济运行的前景产生重大的影响。	How the world resolves this basic inconsistency over the next few years will have a major impact on prospects for growth, employment, income distribution, and the functioning of the global economy.
美国独立战争大局已定后，法国精英并没有回到违约的老路上去 — — 最近一次是1770年 — — 而是竭尽全力避免这一结果。	After the conclusion of the American War of Independence, instead of returning to the old model of default, which had been applied as recently as 1770, the French elite did everything it could to avoid that outcome.
如今这几大市场死气沉沉，资金就必须另找出路 — — 欧洲不是个好去处，因为银行和债务危机尚未消散；美国的宽松货币政策又使国债投资收益甚微。	Today, that market is dead and the money must go elsewhere. Europe, gripped by a tremendous banking and debt crisis, is not an attractive destination, and loose monetary policy in the US has produced ultra-low bond yields there.
但是，这里就有一个明显的矛盾，因为流动性过度怎么会最终导致流动性短缺，结果不得不由中央银行来弥补呢？	But there is an obvious paradox here, because how can an excess of liquidity result ultimately in a shortage of liquidity that has to be made up by central banks?
今天的建筑采暖主要采用锅炉、散热器以及以石油和天然气为燃料的采暖炉；这些都需要由通过电力采暖的建筑来取代。	Today’s buildings are heated mostly by boilers, radiators, and furnaces fueled by heating oil and natural gas; these need to be replaced by buildings heated by electricity.
蒙蒂之前试图解决这个问题，但要把目前的均衡状态转化为另一个更好的均衡 — — 即避税是例外而不是常态 — — 是一项长期的工程。	Monti attempted to address this, but moving from the current equilibrium to a better one, in which tax evasion is the exception rather than the norm, is a long-term project.
由世界银行领导的类似工作也正在非洲展开，而在中美洲，各国政府也正在和美洲间发展银行和中美洲经济一体化银行进行合作。	Similar work is underway in Africa, led by the World Bank and in Central America various countries’ governments are collaborating with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration.
幸运的是，情况正好相反：受战后重建繁荣刺激，联邦岁入增长了三倍，并因为美国在斩获蹂躏欧洲大陆时保持中立而持续快速增长。	Fortunately, the opposite happened: federal revenues tripled under the impact of a rapid post-war reconstruction boom, and continued to grow rapidly, aided by the country’s ability to remain neutral while wars ravaged the European continent.
今年早些时候，亚洲基础设施投资银行（亚投行）的成立吸引了全世界的关注，不仅是因为美国的强烈反对，也时因为英国和德国不顾美国的反对加入其中。	The establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) captured global headlines earlier this year, not just because of strong US resistance, but also because countries like Britain and Germany joined anyway.
欧盟委员会要求芬兰央行行长里卡南（Erkki Liikanen）为首的杰出专家小组在欧洲层面上考察这一问题。	The European Commission asked an eminent-persons group, chaired by Erkki Liikanen, the head of the Finnish central bank, to examine this issue on a European scale.
而中国领导人必须维持高速经济增长从而让大量人民走出贫困 — — 并摆脱合法行危机 — — 这决定了全球食品、能源和矿产价格不可能下跌。	And the rapid economic growth that China’s leaders must sustain in order to lift enormous numbers of people out of poverty – and thus prevent a crisis of legitimacy – places a floor under global food, energy, and mineral prices.
也许布什认为全球变暖的后果在他离职很多年后才会得以显现，而且只会影响到孟加拉这样贫困、没有地位的热带国家，而不是跨越若干气温带的富裕的美国。	Perhaps Bush had hoped that the consequences of global warming would be felt long after he left office – and would be felt more by poor, low-lying, tropical countries like Bangladesh than by a rich country astride the temperate zones.
而要不是纳粹德国入侵波兰令欧洲沦为（二战）战场的话，我们也无法设想1930年末在欧洲爆发的那场萧条会引发何种后果。	In a third case, Europe at the end of the 1930’s, we do not know what would have happened had Europe not become a battlefield following Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland.
央行对通胀的重新关注也不大可能有助于解决问题，因为这将破坏经济活动并加深那些最脆弱群体所承受的痛苦，对那些人来说，失业要比物价上涨更为难熬。	The central bank’s new focus on inflation is unlikely to help matters, either, because it will undermine economic activity and exacerbate the pain experienced by the most vulnerable, for whom unemployment may be worse than rising prices.
克林顿政府曾经试图遏制时任以色列总理的内塔尼亚胡在伯利恒附近建立新定居点，但在暂缓了一阵时候，建设一切照旧。	The Clinton administration attempted to put brakes on then-Prime Minister Netanyahu’s efforts to construct a new settlement near Bethlehem. After a short hiatus, construction resumed.

不仅量化宽松政策重启那些饱受危机折磨且资产负债表受制的经济体的能力有限；它还冒着模糊货币政策和财政政策之间区别的重大风险。	Not only is QE’s ability to jumpstart crisis-torn, balance-sheet-constrained economies limited; it also runs the important risk of blurring the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy.
尽管专制政权结束后经历短期动荡亦属正常现象，但冗长持久的过渡过程代价极其惨重，可能需要几十年才能逐步复苏。	While short-term pain is not unusual following the end of despotic regimes, long and protracted transitions can be terribly costly, requiring decades for societies to recover.

但斯蒂格利茨和哈佛大学的大卫·肯尼迪（David Kennedy）在2013年出版的《中国特色的法律与经济学 》 （ Law and Economics with Chinese Characteristics）一书中写道 ， “ 市场是建立在一定的法律安排基础之上，并通过监管框架来实现稳定的 。 ”	But, as Stiglitz and Harvard’s David Kennedy wrote in the 2013 book Law and Economics with Chinese Characteristics, “markets are built upon a foundation of legal arrangements and stabilized by a regulatory framework.”
这是一场髙赌注赌局：民族国家可以经历失去的十年甚至更长时间而活下来；但作为民族国家的不完全联盟的欧盟很容易因此崩溃。	The stakes are high: Nation-states can survive a lost decade or more; but the EU, an incomplete association of nation-states, could easily be destroyed by it.
从认识世界角度讲，可持续发展实践者研究经济、环境、政治和文化的互动及其对繁荣、社会包容和环境可持续性的影响。	As a method of understanding the world, sustainable-development practitioners study the interactions of the economy, the environment, politics, and culture and how they influence prosperity, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.

Who knows?

如果增长率再低一些，中国的财政状况将会恶化 — — 最初比较缓慢，然后急速恶化 — — 最终公共债务对GDP比率将上升到一个无法维持的水平。	Given a lower growth rate, China’s fiscal position will deteriorate – gradually at first, and then rapidly – with the public debt/GDP ratio eventually rising to an unsustainable level.
其他国家无法简单地复制这些成就；但他们仍然可以汲取这个“刺激”时代人们常常遗忘的主要教训 — — 杜绝泡沫化和短期思维。	Other countries cannot simply copy these achievements; but they can still learn the main lesson that is too often forgotten in a world of “stimulus,” bubbles, and short-term thinking.
一个更具扩张性的货币政策立场或许能大幅强化这场复苏，但对此付出的成本，则是加剧了欧元区本已危险的失衡状况。	An even more expansionary monetary-policy stance might strengthen the recovery marginally, but at the cost of increasing the eurozone’s already-dangerous imbalances.
新斗争情景 — — 更小的作战单位、更大的战斗力、更快的部署 — — 无法用当前现有的军备控制机制覆盖。	New combat scenarios – smaller units, higher fighting power, faster deployment – are not covered by today’s existing arms-control regimes.
"P53蛋白参与所谓的""凋亡""过程，命令受损细胞""自我终结 "" ， 以确保自身的基因缺陷不会遗传给下一代。"	"This protein is involved in a process called apoptosis in which damaged cells commit ""suicide"" to ensure that their defective genes are not passed on to daughter cells."

在过去，赶超的一大动力 — — 如果用增量增长衡量的话 — — 是服务业和制造业的许多活动从发达经济体转移到低工资的发展中国家。	A major driver of past catch-up, if only in terms of incremental growth, was the shift of many activities in both the services and manufacturing sectors from advanced economies to developing countries with lower wages.
我曾于1990年代中期供职于气候变化国际委员会（International Panel for Climate Change ） ， 对关于温室气体排放增长规模的科学证据和随之产生的经济和社会影响进行评估。	I served on the International Panel for Climate Change in the mid-1990’s, reviewing the scientific evidence concerning the magnitude of increases in greenhouse gasses and their economic and social consequences.
德国、意大利、西班牙和瑞典在移民问题上一致，而希腊、法国、意大利和葡萄牙在欧元区宏观经济政策上站在同一阵营。	Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden may agree on the immigration issue, while Greece, France, Italy, and Portugal agree on eurozone macroeconomic policies.
类似地，尽管日本的“安倍经济学”让日元贬值从而复杂化了邻国的决策，但也是一项为了结束长期存在通缩的值得赞赏的措施。	Likewise, though Japan’s “Abenomics,” by depressing the yen, complicates policymaking for the country’s neighbors, it also constitutes a commendable effort to bring deflation to a long-overdue end.
凯南警告正如第一次车臣战争孕育了国家和个人的不满，美国在阿富汗和伊拉克的战争只会助长更多的仇恨和挫折 — — 而这最终会报应回美国。	Kennan warned that, just as the first Chechen war bred national and individual resentment, America’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq would only fuel more hatred and frustration – which would eventually blow back onto the US.
事实上，像容克和马克龙所提出的那种激进的动作，不仅仅不是默克尔的风格；更需要她为此投入全部剩余政治资本。	Indeed, bold action of the type Juncker and Macron have proposed would not just be uncharacteristic for Merkel; it would also require her to invest all of her remaining political capital.
它正确的强调了每个国家都应该设计自己的复合解决方案，而不是提供诸如“让市场起作用”或“把国家治理弄好”这样简单的答案。	Rather than offering facile answers such as “just let markets work” or “just get governance right,” it rightly emphasizes that each country must devise its own mix of remedies.
与此同时，英国首相梅的政府 — — 它承诺要保持与欧洲的“深刻而特殊”的关系 — — 将试图谈判一个新的与欧盟的“基于条约的协定 ” 。	In the meantime, British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, having promised to maintain a “deep and special” relationship with Europe, would try to negotiate a new “treaty-based arrangement” with the EU.
1918年，奥斯瓦尔德·史宾格勒（Oswald Spengler）出版了《西方的衰落 》 （ The Decline of the West ） 。	In 1918, Oswald Spengler published The Decline of the West.
令人难以置信的是，美国纽约第二巡回上诉法院判决这意味着如果阿根廷十足偿付欠接受债务重组者的债务，那么它也必须十足偿付欠兀鹫基金的债务。	Incredibly, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York decided that this meant that if Argentina paid in full what it owed those who had accepted debt restructuring, it had to pay in full what it owed to the vultures.
从国家干预主义的法国到共产主义的中国，经济模式各异的各国都开始采取更加放任自由的决策方法，信奉国家干预越少越好的信条。	From dirigiste France to communist China, countries with widely divergent economic models began to adopt a more laissez-faire policymaking approach, predicated on the idea that the less state intervention, the better.
归根结底，正如专栏作家大卫•布鲁克斯近来所观察到的 ， “ 如果美国真的拥有所谓的软性权力天赋，那就是他们构想新世界的愿望 。 ”	After all, as the columnist David Brooks recently observed, “If there is one soft power gift that America does possess, it is the tendency to imagine new worlds.”
Proctor要求继续对专利进行审核，提交其他几项专利申请甚至几次更换律师（目的就是争取将诉讼时间拖得更长 ） 。	Proctor requested that the patent examination be continued, submitting additional patent claims and even changing his lawyers several times (allowing more bureaucratic delay).
比如，去年塞舌尔宣布与巴黎俱乐部债权人和大自然保护协会进行历史上首次“自然债务 ” （ debt for nature）互换。	For example, last year, the Seychelles announced a first-of-its-kind “debt for nature” swap with its Paris Club creditors and The Nature Conservancy.
这一动作要求无数项目减少支出，包括许多防务研究项目。 美国总统奥巴马政府将其描述为“大大破坏了国家安全 ” 。	The move, which requires reduced spending in numerous programs, including many defense research initiatives, was described by US President Barack Obama’s administration as “deeply destructive to national security.”
同样地，将本来应该出产可持续的建筑材料的土地用于生产生物燃料会推高这些建筑材料的价格，并且使人们转而使用像水泥和钢材这些不可持续的材料。	Similarly, to cultivate bio-fuels on land that would otherwise be used to produce sustainable construction materials would drive up the prices of these materials and encourage their substitution by non-sustainable materials like concrete and steel.
尽管GDP测量一国国内生产的所有商品和服务，但数字时代的许多明星企业（如维基百科、Facebook、Twitter、Mozilla、网景和其他）并不生产产品，并且提供的是免费服务。	While GDP measures the market value of all goods and services produced within a country, many stars of the digital age (think Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, Mozilla, Netscape, and so on) produce no goods and provide free services.
和全世界所有年轻人一样，难民理应获得品质教育 — — 包含官方认可课程、基于严格的评估和升学制度的教育。	Refugees, like all young people around the world, deserve a quality education – one that follows an accredited curriculum, and is based on a rigorous system of evaluation and advancement.
减轻朝鲜核威胁又不让中国占上风的唯一方法是在确保朝鲜半岛全面和平协议的过程中表现出真正的外交领导力。	The only way to mitigate the North Korean nuclear threat, without giving China the upper hand, is to show true diplomatic leadership in securing a comprehensive peace accord on the Korean Peninsula.

类似的反精英情绪 — — 部分受工人阶级对世界主义和经济不平等的怨恨的推动 — — 支持了英国的脱欧运动。	Similar anti-elite sentiment, fueled partly by working-class resentment of cosmopolitanism and economic inequality, underpinned the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union.
欧洲和日本明确表示了宁愿给本国政府和制造企业增加成本，也要缓解全球变暖的燃眉之急，即使这样做会损失自己在竞争中的优势地位也在所不惜。	Europe and Japan have shown their commitment to reduce global warming by imposing costs on themselves and their producers, even if it places them at a competitive disadvantage.
美联储 — — 同理，也包括欧洲央行 — — 需要把存款利率提高到何种程度才能阻止银行贷款的过度扩张？	How high would the Fed – or the ECB, for that matter – have to raise the interest rate on deposits to prevent excessive growth in bank lending?
更多的关于早期非洲土著和澳大拉西亚（如澳大利亚、新几内亚和布干维尔）的杂交例子让情况进一步复杂化了。	The situation is further complicated by additional instances of ancient interbreeding among native populations in Africa and Australasia (for example, Australia, New Guinea, and Bougainville).

其中将不存在有吸引力的选项，而结果 — — 不论双方带着多大的谈判诚意 — — 将让英国和欧盟到遭到国际地位的显著削弱。	There would be no attractive options, and the result – regardless of how much goodwill both sides bring to the talks – would leave both the UK and the EU visibly diminished, not least on the world stage.
上述借贷的条款如此模糊，以至于只有中国才掌握未偿还贷款的数量、到期日和相关成本，这些信息往往都出于政治或战略原因，仅仅在双边基础上予以公布。	The terms of this lending are so murky that only China has information about the volume, maturity, and cost of outstanding loans, which are issued on a bilateral basis, often for political or strategic reasons.
几十年来，化解矛盾及其最显著的成就 — — 法德亲善 — — 是创建一个更加亲密的欧洲的标志性工程。	For decades, “reconciliation” and its most remarkable achievement – the Franco-German rapprochement – was the trademark of the project to create an ever closer union in Europe.
（美国宇航局多年来一直受制于美国国会的政治内讧和赞助，以致于其任务更像是在创造就业机会，而不是太空探索。 ）	(NASA in particular has been constrained by years of political infighting and patronage in the US Congress, to the point where its mission seems to be employment maintenance rather space exploration.)
中国所谓的减速已经引起了一片哀嚎，但中国领导人也许有着比发达经济体领导人更加现实和建设性的宏观经济政策评估。	For all the handwringing over China’s so-called slowdown, it seems as if its leaders may have a more realistic and constructive assessment of the macroeconomic policy challenge than their counterparts in the more advanced economies.
欧盟的目标只有通过灵活性和勇气才能实现，它必须是保持一项可行的工程 — — 从而成为新秩序规则的撰写者之一。	The EU’s goal, achievable only with flexibility and courage, must be to remain a viable project – and thus be one of the authors.
其他相关类别包括商业（含雇主、行业和雇员等实体 ） 、 生物、航天和其他很多领域，还包括阐明其相互关系的描述 — — 如图示、时间安排和表格。	Other categories include business (with entities such as employers, industries, and employees), biology, space flight, and many more, and include representations – such as graphs, timelines, and tables – of how they are connected.
在此间的十年中，阿根廷总统费尔南德兹·基什内尔及其已故丈夫兼前任总统捏斯托·基什内尔实施了一系列糟糕透顶的经济政策。	In the intervening decade, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her late husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner, have pursued a variety of spectacularly bad economic policies.
习近平已经排除了动员群众支持其改革计划的做法，因此唯一迫使官员按其改革计划行事的办法只剩下腐败调查和起诉威胁。	Given that Xi has ruled out mobilizing the Chinese public to support his reform plans, his only means of forcing the bureaucracy to comply with his agenda is the threat of corruption investigations and prosecutions.
一项影响力较大的最新文章的标题总结了争论 ： “ 地位威胁，而非经济困难，解释了2016年总统选情 。 ”	The title of one influential recent paper summarizes the debate: “Status threat, not economic hardship, explains the 2016 presidential vote.”
西班牙足球队的成功不是偶然，而是西班牙从弗朗哥主义“西班牙狂怒 ” （ furia española）的过去中浴火重生、走向胜利的长期演化过程的顶峰。	Spain’s soccer victory was not a fluke but the culmination of a long evolution to emerge as a winning machine from its Francoist furia española past.

约有一百万海地民众现在生活在多米尼加，但只有约10%拥有合法的劳工资格，他们也因此成为贪婪雇主的剥削对象。	About one million Haitians now live in the Dominican Republic, but only about 10% of the Haitian laborers in the country are there legally, a condition that invites their exploitation by greedy employers.
2010年，英格兰银行前行长金（Mervyn King）用数独填表游戏来描述全球储蓄失衡，他强调指出，表格中的数字无法独立选择。	In 2010, former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King famously used the game of Sudoku to depict global savings imbalances, highlighting that the numbers in the table cannot be chosen independently.

这一突出的悖论背后是“双面墨西哥”现象。 “双面墨西哥”是麦肯锡全球研究所（McKinsey Global Institute）发明的词汇，形容墨西哥经济的极端两面性。	What lies behind the apparent paradox is the phenomenon of “the two Mexicos,” the McKinsey Global Institute’s evocative term for the extreme dualism that characterizes Mexico’s economy.
这位将军长期与美国在也门频繁打击的伊斯兰圣战分子过往甚密，同时也早已对总统本人心怀不满，而他本次的举动仅仅是要跟总统家族划清界限而已。	The disgruntled general, who has long-standing ties to the type of jihadists that the United States is battling in Yemen, merely sought to settle a score with the president’s family.
但是对此的回答已经都摆到台面上来了。 有人认为人民币的价值根本没有被低估，而另外一些人则认为它应该对美元升值超过30 % 。	But the answers have been all over the map, with some finding that the yuan is not undervalued at all, while others argue that it should appreciate against the dollar by more than 30%.
从墨西哥到俄罗斯到南韩，这些被慢性债务危机困扰的国家都竭力阻击着投机资本的流入。 这些资本来自于那些为在美元崩溃时寻找资本退出机制的投资者。	Chronic debt-crisis countries from Mexico to Russia to South Korea are all fighting off capital inflows from investors looking for an exit as the dollar collapses.
美国电话电报公司（本文一名作者为该公司董事会成员 ） 、 星巴克和其他企业所展现的企业与教育机构之间的合作可以为工人提供所需的强化新技术。	Collaboration between companies and educational institutions, as AT&T (on whose board one of the authors serves), Starbucks, and other firms are showing, can provide workers with the new or enhanced skills that are increasingly needed.
在华盛顿，许多民主党的议员利用政策辩论的机会将公众的愤怒引向华尔街的大佬,以此为自己谋求政治资本，而共和党人也在寻找机会将公众的愤怒情绪引向民主党人。	In Washington, many Democrats will use these policy debates to capitalize on popular fury at Wall Street, while many Republicans look for an opening to capitalize on hoped-for public anger at the Democrats.
据慈善评估机构Givewell估算，预防疟疾基金会拯救一名儿童的生命需要花费3,500美元，而肯尼亚的一项研究发现，只要在蚊帐推广方面花费1,000美元，就能让一名儿童免于死亡。	According to the charity evaluator Givewell, the Against Malaria Foundation saves a child’s life with every $3,500 it spends, and one study in Kenya even found that as little as $1,000 spent on bed-net distribution can prevent a child’s death.
两个家族的长老花了四天时间谈判出一个较不血腥的方案，商定的价码是一百头骆驼—价值七千美金—作为补偿。	The elders of the two sub-clans spent four days negotiating a less bloody solution, and the agreed price of 100 camels – worth $7,000 – was paid as compensation.
但在包括欧洲大陆和日本在内的世界大部分地区这一走势则明显不同，其中前1％人的收入占比大约是100年前的一半。	But the experience is markedly different in most of the world, including continental Europe and Japan, where the top 1% earn about half what they did 100 years ago.
在过去十五年中，日本都在与增长缓慢、家庭需求长期萎靡（特别是较贫穷家庭）以及不平等性和贫困加剧作斗争。	Japan has spent the last 15 years struggling with slow growth, anemic household demand (especially among poorer families), and rising inequality and poverty.
当美国总统奥巴马在3年前时被授予该奖时，有人批评挪威诺贝尔奖评选委员会把奖颁给了一个尚未拥有成绩的人。	When the choice alighted on Barack Obama three years ago, the Norwegian Nobel Committee was criticized for honoring someone whose achievements were still to come.
而倘若连钻石行业都能将自身建立在道德基础之上的话，那其他那些从世界上最贫穷的人民手中窃取资源以牟利的行业也会有走向正途的一天。	And, if the diamond industry can put itself on an ethical footing, it might send a message to other industries that deal in resources that are effectively being stolen from some of the world’s poorest people.
英国政府于2010年6月宣布赤字削减计划，但现在，它所必须借入的资金规模比计划中多了1120亿英镑。	The British government already must borrow £112 billion ($172 billion) more than it had planned when it announced its deficit-reduction plan in June 2010.
两天半后，只是因为美国副总统迪克·切尼出面干预，这几名土耳其士兵才得以获释。 他们的罪名是：企图在库尔德地区策划秘密行动。	Only intervention by US Vice President Dick Cheney two and a half days later secured the release of the soldiers, who were alleged to have been planning clandestine operations within the Kurdish zone.
发自牛津 — — 虽然欧洲紧缩政策面临的社会阻力与日俱增，但至少该政策在原理上还具备简单直接的优点。	OXFORD – While austerity in Europe faces increasing social resistance, in principle it has the merit of simplicity.
在西班牙和希腊，年轻人失业率超过50 % ， 受危机冲击的塞浦路斯、葡萄牙、意大利和克罗地亚情况也很糟糕。	In Spain and Greece, youth unemployment is above 50%, and the situation is not much better in crisis-hit Cyprus, Portugal, Italy, and Croatia.
发自剑桥 — — 在许多方面，共和党在美国征收一项“边境调整税”的计划都是特朗普总统计划在美墨边境修建的实体围墙的虚拟补充。	CAMBRIDGE – In many ways, the Republican Party’s plan to implement a “border adjustment tax” in the United States is the virtual complement of the physical wall President Donald Trump plans to erect on the US-Mexican border.
其经济增长在2012年最后一个季度提速至7.9 % — —比第三季度7.4%的GDP增长速度高出半个百分点。	Economic growth picked up in the final quarter of 2012 to 7.9% – half a percentage point faster than the 7.4% increase in GDP in the third quarter.
现有的农业、医疗、教育和基础设施方面的应用加起来每年可以增加1,600—2,800亿美元的GDP — — 更重要的是，能让普通印度人获得更多的实力。	Existing applications in agriculture, health care, education, and infrastructure can collectively contribute $160-280 billion to annual GDP – and, more important, empower ordinary Indians.
这意味着并不是美国民众的态度有问题，而是在联邦层级上，美国的政治系统给予了那些拥有巨额选举资金的行业过分巨大的力量，足以将大多数民众的意愿置诸脑后。	That suggests that the problem may not be with US citizens’ attitudes, but rather that, at the federal level, the US political system allows industries with large campaign chests too much power to thwart the wishes of popular majorities.
即使在这些地方什么都没发现也很有意义，因为这些新的数据具有预测性，能够缩小可能存在生命的行星或卫星范围。	Even finding nothing in such places is important, because these new data have predictive power, narrowing the field of planets, or moons, that might harbor life.
塔德里给伊斯兰堡政府发出了20天最后通牒，要求政府净化腐败猖獗的政治制度、重组选举委员会，并任命看守当局监督新选举。	Qadri issued a 20-day ultimatum to the government in Islamabad to purge the political system of rampant corruption, reconstitute the Election Commission, and appoint a caretaker administration to oversee the upcoming vote.
我们来进行一个个案研究，最近一次总体性的商品价格繁荣－崩溃周期导致商品价格从20世纪60年代到20世纪80年代普遍上涨（虽然涨幅或大或小 ） ， 然后开始普遍下跌直到20世纪90年代才结束。	Let’s take a case study, the last generalized boom-bust cycle in commodity prices, which caused these prices generally to rise (more or less) from some time in the 1960’s until the 1980’s, and then generally to fall until the mid-1990’s.
于是，在二十世纪的最后几十年中，目的截然相反的反改革浪潮席卷全球，推崇将资本尽可能地分散以使每个人都能成为所有者。	Then, in the closing decades of the twentieth century, a counter-revolution swept the world, pushing for just the opposite: disperse capital as widely as possible by getting everybody involved as owners.
可靠的公共财政不但需要较低的公债水平，也需要合理的预算政策，包括在繁荣期而不是衰退期（如现在）减少支出（或增加税收 ） 。	Sound public finances require not only low public debt, but also appropriate budgetary policy, which includes cutting spending (or raising taxes) during boom times, not during downturns, as was recently the case.
尽管伊朗与其逊尼派对手的冲突以及叙利亚内战迫使它放松了与伊朗和叙利亚的关系，投入逊尼派阵营，但从诸多方面看，这都是令人满意的变化。	Although the conflict between Iran and its Sunni rivals and the Syrian civil war forced it to loosen ties with Iran and Syria and move into the Sunni fold, in many respects this has been a comfortable shift.
如果说过去38年民主过渡的辉煌历史给我们留下了什么经验，那就是当精英和公众反抗独裁统治，他们就会竭尽所能建设新的体系。	If there is one lesson to be learned from the remarkable history of the democratic transitions of the past 38 years, it is that when elites and the public reject authoritarian rule, they do their best to make the new system work.

While the world dawdles, greenhouse gases are building up in the atmosphere, and the likelihood that the world will meet even the agreed-upon target of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius is diminishing.
因此，金融市场预测美国增长会加速。 这一认识促使美元兑大部分货币（包括人民币）汇率强劲升值，并导致资本逃离新兴经济体。	As a result, financial markets are anticipating faster growth in the United States – a perception that is boosting the dollar’s exchange rate against most currencies, including the renminbi, and triggering capital flight from emerging economies.
但是，在解放伊拉克的过程中，美国并没有质问暴君一开始是如何上台的，以及（因此引出的）推翻他的挑战又是哪些。	Yet, in liberating Iraq, the US failed to ask how the tyrant gained power in the first place, and what, therefore, the challenges in replacing him would be.
该会议本是为了解决“可持续性 ” ， 在会议上看不到人们拿出京都议定书的后续条约的豪情壮举实在令人悲哀。	For a conference that is supposedly addressing “sustainability,” it is worth lamenting the absence of a heroic effort to agree on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Accord.
各国协同下的财政刺激手段在2009年经济危机中拯救了世界，但它也随着政府的注意力转向国内政治以及优先事项而很快消失。	The coordinated fiscal stimulus that saved the world from economic collapse in 2009 disappeared too quickly, with governments shifting their focus to domestic politics and priorities.
正因如此，不仅需要严惩腐败官员，让他们明白滥用权力是不可容忍的并放弃对市场行为的不合理的干预，也需要给予努力工作的官员恰当的激励，如更高的薪水及明确的业绩指标和奖励。	That is why the bureaucracy must be given incentives – higher salaries, clear performance indicators, and awareness that abuses of power will not be tolerated – to abandon the micro-management of market activities.
在布什的第二任期，一些最极端的单边主义者离开了政府，而总统本人在处理北朝鲜或伊朗等更复杂的问题时也采用了比在第一个任期更为多边的策略。	In Bush’s second term, some of the most extreme unilateralists have departed from the government, and the president has approached difficult problems like North Korea or Iran with a more multilateral approach than during his first term.
这次会议由智利政府和联合国开发规划署（UNDP）主办，ILO和联合国妇女组织（UN Women）协办，将强调性别平等在私营部门的重要性。	The gathering – organized by the Chilean government and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the ILO and UN Women – will highlight the importance of gender equality in the private sector.
法国道德和政治权威一直在告诫我们，对国民阵线的“玷污 ” （ stigmatization）不起作用，这只能增强而不是削弱它。 这一情况已经持续了多久了？	For how long have France’s moral and political authorities been telling us that “stigmatization” of the National Front doesn’t work, that it strengthens the party instead of weakening it?
虽然某些工厂岗位可以实现外包或自动化，但机器人还不能改造建筑、在屋顶安装光伏太阳能电池或者建造垂直农场。	While some factory jobs can be outsourced or automated, robots cannot yet retrofit buildings, install solar PV cells on rooftops, or construct vertical farms.
现在是时候重新考虑我们的公共卫生投资和宣传，评价我们捐赠的善款是否发挥了最大的作用，思考我们是否应该加大对一直以来被我们忽视的疾病的力度。	Now is the time to rethink our public-health investments and messaging, and evaluate whether we are getting the best value for our donor dollars, or whether we should do much more to tackle diseases that we have so far largely ignored.
相反，各成员国秉承欧盟最基本的价值观，理应共同承担地中海行动的搜索和救援开支；加强对难民权利的保护；并共同承担起庇护之责。	Instead, acting on the EU’s founding values, member states should co-finance a search and rescue operation along the lines of Mare Nostrum; strengthen their efforts to protect the rights of refugees; and share the burden of granting asylum.
可以想象，如果美国与其盟友之间紧密的军事联盟有所松懈，它们和其他国家的金融行为将会发生巨大的改变，对美元汇率和美国借贷成本造成不利影响。	One can imagine that the financial behavior of these and other countries would change dramatically, with adverse implications for the dollar’s exchange rate and US borrowing costs, were America’s close military alliances with its allies to fray.
对教义的不同诠释使穆斯林成了一盘散沙，不再扮演他们曾经在世界上扮演的角色；相反，他们变得虚弱，饱受迫害。	Divided by their different interpretations, Muslims do not play the role they once did in the world; instead, they are weakened and victimized.
最后，但不是最为次要的一点是，国际货币基金组织作为担负维持全球金融稳定职责的多边机构应当提供更大的领导作用。	Last but not least, the IMF, as the multilateral agency charged with maintaining global financial stability, ought to be providing more leadership.
发达国家政客陷于古怪并且常常有害的冲突之中，而没有在关于如何摆脱长期不平等低增长时期的问题上按照日益一致的经济共识行事。	Advanced-country politicians are locked in bizarre, often toxic, conflicts, instead of acting on a growing economic consensus about how to escape a protracted period of low and unequal growth.
在发达国家，问题的根源在于前所未有的政治极化。 政治极化阻碍了全面应对措施，也给中央银行造成了过重的政策负担。	In the developed world, the problem is rooted in unprecedented political polarization, which has impeded comprehensive responses and placed an excessive policy burden on central banks.
我们在有生之年亲眼见证了从冷战最黑暗的时期到一个崭新时代的令人欢欣鼓舞的过渡，冷战时期的欧洲面临着毁灭性常规及核战争的现实威胁，但现在类似这样的现实威胁已经解除。	In our lifetimes, we have seen a welcome change from the darkest days of the Cold War, when a devastating conventional and nuclear war in Europe was a real possibility, to a new era in which no state faces this type of existential threat.
所有公民都应获得优质、健康而又廉价的食品；提升的农业生产率将惠及农村地区，并使农民在欧盟不断增长的财富中获得相称的一份。	Good, healthy, and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens. Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union’s growing wealth.
这一赌注的第一项 — — 更包容的全球增长 — — 认为美国经济将持续复苏，强健的工资增长将让今年的增长率达到3 % 。	The first component of the bet – more inclusive global growth – anticipates continued economic recovery in the United States, with a 3% growth rate this year bolstered by robust wage growth.
萨勒曼·本·阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹国王是国家无可争议的领袖，但其子穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼·萨乌德王子目前掌握着大部分权力。	King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is the country’s above-the-fray ruler, but his son, Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, currently wields much of the power.
美国驻印度大使鲍威尔（Nancy Powell）在纽约给印度人民的信中沮丧地说，印美关系“因为牵涉到你们的领事官员及其本国工人的事件的不同反应而受到了伤害 。 ” 但印度人民依然怒气冲天。	Tempers remain inflamed, with US Ambassador Nancy Powell, in a New Year’s message to Indians, ruefully acknowledging that ties have been “jolted by very different reactions to issues involving one of your consular officers and her domestic worker.”
的确，伊拉克的儿童由于各种原因，不论年龄都经常遭到殴打，因此他们就在这样的环境中成长为缺乏安全感、充满敌意和有暴力倾向的人。	Indeed, Iraqi children are exposed to beating without regard for their age and for myriad reasons, thus growing up insecure, hostile, and violent.
我们的许多建议被忽视（如此之多的自由市场解决方案从未被使用过！ ） ， 这一事实令我们颇为尴尬，于是我们把政客和官僚本身的行为也纳入了我们的分析范围。	Frustrated by the reality that much of our advice went unheeded (so many free-market solutions still waiting to be taken up!), we turned our analytical toolkit on the behavior of politicians and bureaucrats themselves.
当黎巴嫩和索马里依然满目疮痍，毫无进步的时候，越南和东南亚自身的地区和国内因素则缓和了美国撤军的后果—即今天世界看到的这个局势稳定的地区。	While Lebanon and Somalia remain damaged and failed states, respectively, regional and domestic factors have cauterized the consequences of America’s retreat from Vietnam and Southeast Asia. The result is the stable region that the world sees today.
欧洲各国（特别是德国）观察家现在已经意识到合并失败将会产生的重大后果。 德国媒体一直对“消极政治”如何决定合并提案的命运持有极端批评的态度。	The significance of the merger’s collapse is now becoming clear to observers across Europe, especially in Germany, where the media have been extremely critical of how “negative politics” sealed the proposed merger’s fate.
与此同时，伊朗人民 — — 包括位于富尔道（Fordow）核设施附近的圣城库姆（Qom）的神职人员 — — 十分担心袭击的后果。	Meanwhile, Iran’s citizens – including clergy in the holy city of Qom, near the Fordow nuclear facility – are deeply concerned about the consequences of an attack.
但是，伊拉克战争爆发时，条件已经发生了变化：美国相对于世界其它国家力量变得如此强大，缺乏协商互动即便对美国最亲密的盟友来说也成为了愤怒的源泉。	But, by the time of the Iraq war, conditions had changed: the US had grown so powerful relative to the rest of the world that the lack of reciprocity became an intense source of irritation even to America’s closest allies.
去年12月与默克尔的柏林会晤中，卢拉坚持巴西政府的传统立场：即像美国拼命鼓吹的那种制裁不会有任何结果，取得进展的最佳方式是展开对话。	During his meeting in Berlin with Merkel last December, Lula insisted on the Brazilian government’s traditional position: sanctions, such as those that the United States strongly advocates, lead to nothing; the best way forward is dialogue.
2007~2009年的金融危机本也预示着类似的后果，但这次全球政府和央行都联合起来果断出手干预，拿出了规模足够大的刺激政策。	The 2007-2009 financial crisis portended a similar outcome, but this time the world’s governments and central banks intervened promptly, in a coordinated fashion, and with an appropriately high volume of stimulus.
到2025年世界上将有大约1000亿个互联设备，而为了从这些连接中获取最大价值，我们需要优化各项网络，不论它们是为物还是为人而设。	By 2025, the world will have some 100 billion connected devices, and to derive maximum value from these linkages, we will need to optimize our networks for things as well as people.
新概念总是难以令人接受，它们要求人们采取新思维，即便是斯蒂格利茨和萨默斯这样的睿智之士，也有可能难以吸收。	New ideas are often difficult to accept, and they require investment in a different way of thinking that can be difficult to absorb, even for people as smart as Stiglitz and Summers.
结果将类似于美国国会1930年批准、由声誉不佳的前共和党总统胡佛签署的史穆特-哈雷关税（Smoot-Hawley Tariff ） — —该措施加剧了大萧条。	The consequences would resemble those of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, enacted by the US Congress in 1930 and signed by an earlier, disgraced Republican president, Herbert Hoover – a measure that exacerbated the Great Depression.
现有的养老金体系经常惩罚那些希望在正式退休年龄以后工作的人，而年龄歧视阻碍了许多有能力工作到六七十岁的人。	Existing pension systems often penalize people who wish to work beyond the official retirement age, and age discrimination impedes many who are capable of working into their sixties and seventies.
实际的资金外流极为有限，也没有发达经济体国家大幅提高利率；事实上，随着美国的经常账户赤字不断缩减，来自美国的净资本流入在过去12个月内不断增加。	Actual capital-flow reversals have been very limited, and no advanced country will raise interest rates sharply; in fact, with the United States’ current-account deficit diminishing, net flows from the US have increased over the last 12 months.
截止来年，每名商人从挣第1块欧元起就必须缴纳26%的营业税 — — 此外还被要求在2016年预缴高达75%的2017年赋税。	As of next year, every merchant will face a 26% turnover tax from the first euro they earn – while being required to pre-pay in 2016 a full 75% of their 2017 taxes.
尽管2009年大衰退时期油价出现了崩盘，但随后又迅速恢复，俄罗斯产出的价值在2012—2013年达到了又一顶峰 — — 这也正是俄罗斯对欧盟-乌克兰入盟协议态度开始强硬的时候。	Though prices collapsed during the Great Recession of 2009, they quickly recovered, with the value of Russian output reaching another peak in 2012-2013 – precisely when Russia’s position on the EU-Ukraine association agreement hardened.
多亏有了他指责的改革所带来的经济增长，印度和巴西这些国家如今才能有更多的财政收入去提供公共产品，其中就包括穷人的医疗卫生保障。	Thanks to the economic growth that resulted from the reforms that he denounced, countries like India and Brazil now have higher revenues to spend on health care for the poor, among other public goods.
1980年，生物学家保罗·欧利希（Paul Ehrlich）和经济学家朱利安·西蒙（Julian Simon）进行了另一场著名的赌局 — — 十年后五种金属的价格。	In 1980, the biologist Paul Ehrlich and the economist Julian Simon made another famous wager – on the price of five metals ten years later.
一般而言，提高通胀的三个关键是工资增长（源自劳动力的稀缺 ） 、 公众未来通胀预期升高，以及有利的外部环境。	Generally, three keys to higher inflation are wage increases, resulting from labor scarcity; expectations of higher future inflation among the public; and a favorable external environment.
这解释了为何比特币软件客户端Bitcoin Core每秒钟只处理5—7笔交易，而维萨卡每秒钟可以可靠地处理25,000笔交易。	This explains why Bitcoin Core, the Bitcoin software client, processes only 5-7 transactions per second, compared to Visa, which reliably processes 25,000 transactions per second.
报纸和电视媒体在丑闻报道中毫不留情，从而向巴西民众和国外投资者证明了巴西的政治体制足够稳定，能够经受得起公开责难的考验。	Newspapers and television commentators have been relentless in reporting the scandals, helping to prove to Brazilians and foreign investors alike that the political system is sufficiently stable to withstand open criticism.
至于物价稳定使命，石油价格崩盘必然地影响了去年的标题数字，但核心通胀（剔除能源）趋势表明美联储已经落后于形势。	As for the price-stability mandate, the oil-price collapse has naturally affected headline figures over the past year, but the trend in core inflation (excluding the energy component) suggests that the Fed is falling behind the curve.
他在宣布导弹袭击时明确阐述了这一目标 ： “ 在任何情况下美国都不会寻求在叙利亚无限期的军事存在 ， ” 他说。	He made this clear when he announced the missile strikes: “America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria under no circumstances,” he said.
比起处理那些关于如何分配有限资源的棘手问题，民主政府似乎觉得自己可以独占全部好处：一面维持低税率，一面依赖充足的债务融资来发动战争或者推动社会项目取悦选民。	Rather than tackle thorny questions about how to allocate limited resources, democratic governments seem to believe that they can have it all: low taxes and ample debt finance to fund wars or electorate-pleasing programs.
鱼类储备补充匮乏的年份意味着渔场会失去新的鱼群和大部分产卵鱼，因为产卵鱼在得以再次产卵之前就已被捕捞。	A bad year for recruitment in a fished-down stock means losing both the new cohort and most of the spawners, because the latter are caught before they can spawn again.
它不但出现了十多年来第一个亏损季度；还达成了初步协议向美国政府支付130亿美元罚款作为不当出售按揭支持证券的处罚。	Not only has the bank just reported its first quarterly loss in more than a decade; it has also agreed to a tentative deal to pay a fine of $13 billion to the US government as punishment for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.
日本和欧洲的强劲出口支持经济恢复增长、也稳定了投资者的心态，进而又为新兴的工业化国家，特别是中国，提供了进一步的出口机遇。	Robust exports from Japan and Europe supported economic recovery and steadied investor confidence, providing, in turn, further export opportunities for newly industrializing countries, most notably China.
与此相似，英国石油公司公布的“深水地平线”泄漏数据为每天800吨，而独立专家小组所做的估算比这高出很多倍。	Similarly, whereas BP has been using a release figure of 800 tons per day From Deepwater Horizon, estimates by independent experts are many times higher.
此外，她的阵营正在苦苦摆脱一项披露所造成的困局：在担任奥巴马的国务卿期间，她通过私人邮件服务器处理公务。	Moreover, her campaign is struggling to escape the quagmire produced by revelations that she conducted official business on a private email server during her tenure as Obama’s Secretary of State.
从这个角度看，可持续发展应该定义为“满足当前需求，同时保护当前和子孙后代所依赖的地球生命支持系统的发展 ” 。	Viewed this way, sustainable development should be redefined as “development that meets the needs of the present while safeguarding the Earth’s life-support system, on which the welfare of current and future generations depends.”
加入的成员国只是建立一个共同的中央银行，但并没有设立相关共同税收系统，这项原则在马斯垂克条约的 125 条中有清楚的写明。	The participating states established a common central bank, but they explicitly refused to surrender the right to tax their citizens to a common authority.
就其本身而言，苹果的果糖并不是特别健康，因为如果大量食用会导致罹患糖尿病、心脏病和其他非传染性疾病的风险增加。	By itself, the fruit’s fructose isn’t particularly healthy, and when eaten in large quantities, it increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and other non-communicable diseases.
巴勒斯坦军队司令的职务理论上把巴勒斯坦军队、安全和情报单位划归一人领导，由他来确保巴勒斯坦的法治进程。	The position of the commander of the Palestinian forces supposedly puts the various Palestinian military, security, and intelligence units under one leader, who is expected to ensure the rule of law.
诺斯的理论遗产对于未来几年中国决策者应对制度改革挑战至关重要，因为它给出了关于如何应对快速制度变化的实用指引。	North’s theoretical legacy could prove vital for China’s policymakers in the coming years, because it gives them specific guidance about how to cross the river of rapid institutional change.
但这在民众逐渐认同某种新身份的城市并不是一种牵强的转变 — — 民众分化为纳赛尔的支持者、叙利亚社会党党员、伊斯兰分子或共产主义分子 — — 同时淡化了他们的地区起源和部落血统。	But this was not a farfetched transformation in a city where people were assuming new identities – such as Nasserist, Baathist, Islamist, or communist – downplaying their regional and tribal origins.
西非爆发的埃博拉疫情应当促使国际医疗卫生政策做出修正，推动建立快速反应机制和高效的医疗卫生基础设施。	The West African Ebola epidemic should inspire a course correction on international health policy, reinforcing the need for rapid-response tools and strong health-care infrastructure.
虽然债券很难对这种风险进行完美对冲，但它们的作用通常要好于股票（除非发生波及全球的灾难，两者的回报率都出现问题 ） 。	Though bonds are hardly a perfect hedge against such risks, they typically beat stocks (except, perhaps, in cases of global conflagration, when both fare badly).
某种程度上讲，女性所取得的进展只不过是二十世纪六十年代慢慢开始形成的给予男性和女性平等机会的运动的一个正常结果。	In a sense, women’s advance is simply the normal consequence of the gradual move to effective equality of opportunity that began in the 1960’s.
在这出大戏背后，特朗普有着确定的清晰目标，以及所见略同的内阁和部门首脑 — — 还有并没有因为被曝光的总统行为“猛料”而分散注意力的人们。	Behind the drama, Trump has certain clear goals, and cabinet and agency heads who share them – and who don’t get distracted by the publication of a juicy account of the president’s behavior.
此外，20位领导人还支持全球基础设施计划（Global Infrastructure Initiative ） ， 准备建立一个全球基础设施枢纽（Global Infrastructure Hub）作为政府、私人部门、开发银行和国际组织共享知识的平台。	Moreover, the 20 leaders endorsed the Global Infrastructure Initiative, which will create a Global Infrastructure Hub to serve as a knowledge-sharing platform for governments, the private sector, development banks, and international organizations.
目前，约有46%的选民年龄在30岁以下。 以过去的选举经验来看，年轻的选民比年老的有更高的投票率，一些人士预测，超过半数的参与投票选民的年龄将在16—29岁之间。	Some 46% of the electorate is under the age of 30. In previous elections, younger voters have turned out in greater numbers than their elders, leading some to predict that half of the voters will be in the 16-to-29 age bracket.
如果他们认为他们可以仅凭解释当前全球经济体系的好处，以及调整政策补偿落后群体就能平息公众质疑的话，他们将遭到当头棒喝。	If they think they can allay public concerns simply by explaining the benefits of the current global economic system and tweaking policies to compensate those left behind, they are in for a rude awakening.
具体而言，欧洲最强大的经济体德国和欧洲统一思想的发源地法国应该同时宣布退出欧元区，从新采用德国马克和法郎。	Specifically, Germany, Europe’s greatest economic power, and France, the intellectual progenitor of European unification, should announce their simultaneous exit from the euro and re-adoption of the Deutsche Mark and the franc.
中国人成功的秘诀在于，一个聪明的农家少年所在的村庄不遗余力地为他提供教育，而在他成功踏上仕途的过程中，所有帮助过他的人的地位都得以提升。	The Chinese myth of success was the bright peasant boy whose village clubbed together to educate him and whose subsequent success resulted in the elevation of all who had helped him on his way into the civil service.
显而易见，全球经济最近几十年的增长 — — 包括过去五年许多发展中国家的出色表现 — — 并未能创造出足够的好工作岗位。	Evidently, the global economy’s growth in recent decades – including the last half-decade when many developing countries did quite well – has not created enough good jobs.
大多数专家预计，这一举动会把包括委内瑞拉、尼日利亚以及其他美国、中国以及印度所消费的石油价格推到100美元以上。	Most experts predict that such a move would drive the price of oil – including the Venezuelan, Nigerian, and other oil that the US, China, and India consume – above $100 per barrel.
类似地，他的标志性医疗改革 — — 患者保护和平价医疗法（Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act）也获得了通过。	Likewise, he got his landmark health-care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed.
他（或她）将会继续留守伊拉克，继续以支持以色列的姿态介入以巴冲突，应对更为强悍的俄罗斯和更有雄心的中国，并面对全球变暖的挑战。	He (or she) will have to stay in Iraq, engage in the Israel-Palestine conflict on the side of Israel, confront a tougher Russia, deal with an ever more ambitious China, and face the challenge of global warming.
在这种意义上，本·拉登期望美国会禁不住引诱，像20年前苏联一样，在阿富汗发动一场血腥的战争。 苏联那次入侵为圣战分子创造了甚为肥沃的人员招募土壤。	In that sense, bin Laden hoped that the US would be lured into a bloody war in Afghanistan, similar to the Soviet intervention two decades earlier, which had created such a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists.
但与此同时，信息社会和全球化造就了一个愈来愈不安全的世界，在这个环境中，我们不得不承担难以为日常政治下定义的风险性。	At the same time, the information society and globalization have made ours a more insecure world, where we experience risks that politics-as-usual has been unable to address.
这种方式比传统的贷款获利更加丰厚：一些银行家可以在不为人知的情况下放出大量贷款 — — 除了一个细节：那些积累了低成本借款的政府有时确实会赖帐。	It was more lucrative business than traditional lending: a few bankers could lend enormous sums with little due diligence – except for the small detail that governments plied with easy credit do sometimes default.
在这个共和党主导州的民主党领导的城市，两党一致 — — 归功于前市长朱利安·卡斯特罗（Julián Castro）和州长格雷格·阿伯特（Greg Abbott）的努力 — — 至关重要。	For a Democrat-led city in a Republican-dominated state, bipartisan agreement – achieved through the efforts of former Mayor Julián Castro and Governor Greg Abbott – was essential.
这份研究还发现 ， “ 依靠固体有机物质的集约有机农业，如在播种前向土壤中加入粪堆肥，会产让大量硝酸盐渗入”地下水。	The study also found that “intensive organic agriculture relying on solid organic matter, such as composted manure that is mixed in to the soil prior to planting, resulted in significant down-leaching of nitrate” into groundwater.
外人可以并应该使他们的观点为中国所知，但是，这应该是私下里进行并且不应该说和做可能激起我们不提倡的民族主义的事情。	Outsiders can and should make their views known, but mostly in private and without saying and doing things likely to stimulate the very nationalism we want to discourage.
如果欧洲人被自我封闭小国寡民的虚幻幸福承诺所迷惑，并在最需要深度合作的时刻抛弃了60年以来的深度合作，这将是非常讽刺的。	It would be ironic if Europeans, enthralled by illusory promises of blissful national self-containment, threw away 60 years of deep cooperation at a moment when such cooperation is needed more than ever.
在整个所谓“恐怖战争”时期，伊斯兰与西方之间的“文明冲突”这一概念一直因政治上不准确、知性上固执而遭到驳斥。	Throughout the so-called “war on terror,” the notion of a “clash of civilization” between Islam and the West has usually been dismissed as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded.
不管普京对乌克兰的行为可以带来什么短期好处，都无法抵消长期坏处 — — 俄罗斯将无法获得现代化其工业、将其能源勘探扩展到北冰洋地区所需要的西方技术。	Whatever short-term gains Putin’s actions in Ukraine provide will be more than offset in the long term, as Russia loses access to the Western technology it needs to modernize its industry and extend energy exploration into frontier Arctic regions.
此外，最难办到的是，需要更新调查的氛围，以降低部门偏见（departmental bias）的风险，特别是当证据指向官方或政府实体的时候（这种可能性相当大 ） 。	And, most challenging of all, a new investigative ethos is needed to reduce the risk of departmental bias, especially if evidence points toward official or government entities, as some suggest it might.
工人面临着种种困境：从对大龄人员（35岁以上者）的极端歧视到身体虐待，上卫生间的时间不足，没有加班费，工资也少得可怜。	Workers face everything from rampant discrimination against older people (those over 35) to physical abuse, lack of bathroom breaks, no overtime pay, and poverty wages.
但世卫组织从未在其治理机构世界卫生大会（World Health Assembly）上提出这一建议，之所以如此，是因为部分成员国将拒绝该定义，也拒绝在国内推广该定义所伴生的义务。	But WHO has never proposed such a definition to its governing body, the World Health Assembly, presumably because some of its member states would reject the definition and the accompanying obligations to promote it domestically.
个中的悖论是地处下游的巴基斯坦利用该条约 — — 全世界最慷慨的水资源共享协议 — — 为自身保留了印度六河体系超过80%的水资源 — — 以便支持印巴冲突。	The paradox here is that downstream Pakistan has used that treaty – the world’s most generous water-sharing deal, reserving for Pakistan more than 80% of the waters of the six-river Indus system – to sustain its conflict with India.
此后，日本决策者一直致力于启动安倍所谓的第三支“箭 ” ： 重要行业的艰巨改革计划以及破除增长的结构性壁垒。	Since then, Japanese policymakers have been working to launch what Abe calls the third “arrow” of his agenda: arduous reforms of key industries and the demolition of structural barriers to growth.
李光耀执意成立高尚委员会证明家人当政不是依靠裙带关系，之后又着手对任何敢于挑战这一观点的人进行起诉。	Lee established a high-minded committee to establish that nepotism was not the reason, and then set about suing anyone who dared to suggest otherwise.
欧洲政治联盟还能够将欧洲打造成能与美国分庭抗礼的一极，从而让外交网络的法国在欧洲和世界事务上扮演重要角色。	A European political union could also make Europe a power comparable to the United States, and thereby give France, with its sophisticated foreign service, an important role in European and world affairs.
正如我在别处所指出的，长期以来，政府都在提供大面额钞票，这是拣了芝麻丢了西瓜，因为大面额钞票的大部分都用在了地下经济和非法活动上。	And, as I have argued elsewhere, governments have long been penny-wise and pound-foolish to provide large-denomination notes, given that a large share are used in the underground economy and to finance illegal activities.
目前，至少有60家央行将人民币纳入了外汇储备组合，因此明年对中国来说是一个推进其改革全球货币体系的长期目标的理想机会。	With at least 60 central banks now including renminbi among their foreign reserves, next year could present an ideal opportunity for China to advance its long-term goal of reshaping the world monetary system.
事实上，阿文德·萨布拉曼尼安（Arvind Subramanian）指出，中国GDP和贸易占世界之比才是让人民可能成为全球储备货币的因素。	Indeed, as Arvind Subramanian has argued, China’s share of global GDP and trade is what makes the renminbi likely to become a global reserve currency.
核追踪技术远非完美，但只有九个国家拥有核武器；其核材料的同位素标识都明确地为外界掌握；而非国家参与者的进入壁垒很高。	Nuclear attribution is not perfect, but there are only nine states with nuclear weapons; the isotopic identifiers of their nuclear materials are relatively well known; and non-state actors face high entry barriers.
多数公众喜欢他用粗俗而尖刻的语言抨击包括法国总理多米尼克·德维尔潘（Dominique de Villepin）在内的其他右派人士，尤其喜欢听他攻击希拉克。	Much of the public likes his raw language and harsh criticism of the rest of the right, notably of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, but above all of Chirac.
在现实中，在“阿拉伯之春”爆发近三年后，土耳其迷失自我的程度更甚于欧洲，即使土耳其需要欧洲的程度更甚于土耳其人之所愿承认。	In reality, nearly three years after the beginning of the “Arab Spring,” Turkey is more in search of itself than it is of Europe, even if it needs Europe more than Turks are willing to admit.
联合国开发计划署的2004年度伊拉克生活水平调查是有关伊拉克就业情况的唯一的可信的调查。 该调查表明伊拉克的失业率为10.5 % 。	The only decent survey of employment in Iraq, the United Nations Development Program’s Iraq Living Standards Survey of 2004 , measured unemployment at 10.5%.
SDG无法确保全球行动，但如美国总统约翰·肯尼迪曾经评论联合国协议的那样，它们可以起到杠杆作用，促使世界采取行动。	The SDGs will not ensure global action, but, as US President John F. Kennedy once said about UN agreements, they can serve as a lever to help move the world toward action.
但是，除了给唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）这类认为中国是不公平交易者的人提供佐证之外，对一个并不能得到金融市场完全信任的政府来说这将是非常危险的策略选项。	But, aside from providing fodder for the likes of Donald Trump, who believes that China is an unfair trader, this would be a very dangerous choice of strategy for a government that financial markets do not really trust.
不幸的是，刺激性消费和对金融系统的紧急援助，再加上衰退期间收入的下降效应，共同铸成了多数发达国家超过GDP10%的财政赤字。	Unfortunately, stimulus spending and the related bailout of the financial system, together with the recession’s effect on revenues, contributed to fiscal deficits on the order of 10% of GDP in most advanced economies.
具有讽刺意味的是，国际货币基金组织第一个促进资本市场长期自由化的企图仓促而就，其记忆还是今天的一个障碍。	Ironically, bad memories of the IMF’s first, premature attempt to promote long-term capital market liberalization remain an obstacle today.
我很自豪凭借马佐维耶茨基执政期间及其后积累的经验，波兰仍能为欧盟的东南部邻国、以及突尼斯和缅甸等国家提供有价值的建议。	I am proud that Poland, thanks to the expertise gained in the Mazowiecki years and after, can provide advice to the European Union’s eastern and southern neighbors, as well as countries like Tunisia and Burma.
委内瑞拉应否推迟重建民主，先着手驱逐总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗（Nicolás Maduro）和恢复经济，还是在解决经济问题之前先重新建立民主？	Should Venezuela postpone the reestablishment of democracy and focus on ousting President Nicolás Maduro and reviving the economy, or should it reestablish democracy before tackling economic matters?
但青年、失业、对未来的迷茫，以及造成全国性痼疾泛滥的令人窒息的国家温情主义，却像线索一样把它们紧紧地联系在一起。	But their unifying thread is youth, unemployment, and uncertainty about the future, as well as the suffocating state paternalism that underlies the wider malaise itself.
正如已故芝加哥大学经济学家舍温·罗森（Sherwin Rosen）所假设的那样，全球化和信息交流技术的变革逐渐令明星经济在许多领域变得重要。	As the late University of Chicago economist Sherwin Rosen postulated, globalization and changing communication technologies have increasingly made the economics of superstars important in a variety of fields.
当然，欧盟采取行动的能力取决于其成员国的意愿，虽然其中一些领头国家不断推进这一动议，但其他国家却对此不甚热心。	Of course, the European Union's ability to act is dependent on the willingness of its member states; and, though some of the continent's leaders have championed the initiative, others have proved less enthusiastic.
禁闭在小箱子里的时间不能超过2小时，但是如果犯人可以在箱子里站起来，则每次可持续8小时，每天18小时。	Confinement in a small box could not exceed two hours, but if the prisoner could stand in the box, it could continue up to eight hours at a time, 18 hours a day.
欧元的推行 — — 以及其中所暗含的较低的欧元区整体通胀率 — — 将希腊和其他高利率国家的利率大幅拉低。 这些国家经不住低利率的诱惑，提高了政府借贷，希腊和意大利的债务占GDP比重均超过了100 % 。	Until recently, the bond markets treated all euro sovereign debts as virtually equal, not raising interest rates on high-debt countries until the possibility of default became clear.
如今，页岩革命将美国从能源进口国变为能源出口国，北美有望在未来十年中实现自给，而中国越来越依赖进口能源。	Now the shale revolution has transformed it from an energy importer to an exporter, and North America may be self-sufficient in the coming decade at the same time that China is becoming more dependent on energy imports.
普林斯顿 — — 两百年前的同一个月，拿破仑·波拿巴在滑铁卢战役中败于威灵顿公爵所率盟军之手重新塑造了欧洲的未来。	PRINCETON – Two hundred years ago this month, at the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon Bonaparte’s defeat at the hands of an allied army, led by the Duke of Wellington, reshaped Europe’s future.
这不但是因为我曾经指出关于全球变暖的基本研究方法是错的，也更因为他们对我一直坚持的观点 — — 大幅度削减碳排放的做法是错误的 — — 既感到恼火，又觉得沮丧。	This is not because I have ever suggested that the basic science of global warming is wrong. Rather, it reflects anger and frustration over my insistence on pointing out that drastic carbon cuts make no sense.
在每一个工作日，人们可以把许多不同的活动混在一起来做 — — 或许伏案工作，也可能与好友午餐，健身，干些零散事情，出差公干，上网购物 … … 不一而足。	In the course of a work day, people mix and match many activities – they may work at a desk, but they may also meet a friend for lunch, go to the gym, do chores, travel on business, shop online, and so on.
相反，果糖虽然也是一种能量，但对人类而言却是一种退化的营养素；我们的细胞不需要吸收果糖才能发挥作用。	Conversely, fructose, while also an energy source, is a vestigial nutrient for humans; our cells do not need it to function.
显然，CCS在商业上可行的唯一办法是用于EOR，这意味着煤炭本身永远无法成为清洁能源，即使可以用现代过滤装置来减少微粒空气污染。	It is already clear that CCS is commercially viable only when used for EOR, which means that coal itself will never be a clean fuel, even if modern filters can be used to reduce particulate air pollution.
目前，加大参与多边机构对中国的改变比反过来更大，即使在中国投票权增加到能够更好地反映其贡献的程度的情况下也是如此。	For now, increased engagement in multilateral institutions seems likely to change China more than it changes the institutions, even as China’s voting power increases to reflect better its growing contributions.
特拉维夫—已故历史学家埃里克·霍布斯鲍姆（Eric Hobsbawm）将二十世纪称为“极端的年代 ” ， 在这个时代，社会主义带来了古拉格；自由资本主义带来了周期性萧条；民族主义带来了两次世界大战。	TEL AVIV – The late historian Eric Hobsbawm described the twentieth century as the “age of extremes,” in which state socialism led to the gulag; liberal capitalism led to cyclical depressions; and nationalism led to two world wars.
如果日本银行正确，那么它应该维持现有方针，同时政府应该中止下一步消费税提高或将其分解为两次1%的提升而不是一次性提高2 % 。	If the BOJ is right, it should maintain its current approach, while the government should either postpone the next consumption-tax increase or implement it in two 1% increments, instead of a single 2% hike.
报告提出要为农业和农商企业发展提供支持，让它们与其他部门形成连接，并采取措施加强对价格冲击的恢复力。	It suggests support for agriculture and agribusiness development and linking them with other sectors, as well as measures to boost resilience to price shocks.
因为来源往往很难分清，所以此前的成功、引用偏好、目前的知识局限和公理让圈内人对“可能”的定义产生了约定俗成的认识。	Those who are immersed in a field have an established view of what is possible, based on some combination of previous successes, citation bias, current limits of knowledge, and truth – and it is often difficult to distinguish these sources.
有些孩子因伤或肿瘤而失去了分泌生长激素的能力；也有人由于基因突变从一出生就缺乏正常的生长激素活动；还有人根本就没有生长激素的基因密码。	Some children lose the ability to make growth hormone due to injury or tumors; others lack normal growth-hormone activity from birth, owing to a genetic mutation; and others are missing the gene that codes for the hormone altogether.
但ISSG中既有盟友也有对手 — — 比如沙特阿拉伯和伊朗 — — 这意味着能否继续取得进展仍是个挑战。	But the ISSG comprises both allies and adversaries – for example, Saudi Arabia and Iran – meaning that continued progress will be a challenge.
即使在最近的经济衰退之前，阿拉伯世界的失业率也达到了14%的水平 — — 除了撒哈拉以南非洲之外这个数字堪称全世界最高。	Even before the current economic recession, unemployment in the Arab world was estimated at 14% – the world’s highest average outside sub-Saharan Africa.
比如，美国对墨西哥打击卡特尔运动的支持似乎牢不可破，国会显然已经做好准备为又一年的军事和安全设施升级提供3亿美元的经费。	For example, US support for Mexico’s campaign against the cartels looks set in stone, with Congress apparently ready to provide $300 million for another year of military and security upgrading.
事实上，卡扎菲确信官僚主义阻碍其向民众传达讯息的想法促使他定期破坏部委，并把特权阶层的个人关系凌驾于地方机构之上。	Indeed, Qaddafi’s belief that the bureaucracy impeded the transmission of his message to the masses spurred him to dismantle ministries periodically and place privileged personal relationships above institutional hierarchies.
这种平衡事实上是对200年来历史的反常行为的一种纠正。 期间，亚洲地区在全球国民生产总值的份额下降了近50 % ， 曾经一度不到全球国民生产总值的10 % 。	Even before the crisis, there was a rebalancing of economic power – in fact, a correction of a 200-year historical anomaly, in which Asia’s share of global GDP fell from nearly 50% to, at one point, below 10%.
有人甚至提出这可能在明年大选中促使民众选择一个更加激进的什叶派政府 — — 这样的政府对库尔德人的态度可能远不像现在这般宽容。	Some argue that it might even drive voters to choose a more radical Shia government in next year’s elections – one that would be far less accommodating toward the Kurds.
这种教训也适用于中越两国：1979年，中国重施故技，突袭越南。 中国领导人邓小平承认这一袭击就是要给越南“一个教训 ” 。	The same lesson is applicable to the Sino-Vietnamese context: In 1979, China replicated the 1962 model by launching a surprise blitzkrieg against Vietnam that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping admitted was designed to “teach a lesson.”
美联储没有避免二十世纪九十年代的经济衰退。 研究一下格林斯潘当时向国会所做的证词就可以知道经济问题的基本性质并未得到很好地理解。	The Fed failed to avert the economic downturn of 1990, and a reading of Greenspan’s testimony to Congress during that period makes clear that the basic nature of the economy’s problems was not well understood.
马德里 — — 欧盟由成员自由意志、而非军事力量推动的民主整合已经站在了制度创新的最前沿，并且达到了前所未有的高度。	MADRID ‒ The European Union has taken democratic integration – driven by the free will of its members, rather than military force – to unprecedented levels, securing its place at the forefront of institutional innovation.
他指出市场经济的民主化只有在“民主政治的相应深化发展”后才有可能实现，而这意味着“市场本身的制度重建 ” 。	The democratization of the market economy, he says, is possible only with “a corresponding deepening of democratic politics,” which implies “the institutional reconstruction of the market itself.”
它们还大大地帮助使资产价值总体上处于一个很高的水准，并且创造了令当今的饥渴的年轻投资者们如此羡慕的巨大的财富。	They have also contributed mightily to the high general level of asset prices, helping create the vast riches of which today’s hungry young traders are so jealous.
但对他来说公共财政仍是一个不解之谜：他在直觉上认为规模达万亿且每秒增加5170英镑的国债是一件非常糟糕的事情。	But public finance is a mystery to him: he just had the gut feeling that a national debt in the trillions and growing by £5,170 a second was a very bad thing.
作为公民，我们有义务要求国家领导人坚持上述原则，只有这样在伊斯坦布尔达成的协议才不会沦为一场乌托邦式的美梦。	It is our task as citizens to demand that our national leaders uphold these principles, so that the agreements reached in Istanbul do not remain utopian wishes.
即使在越战期间，以及从东南亚狼狈地撤退之后，人们也从未真正怀疑过美国应对冷战这个当时的核心战略挑战的权威和能力。	Even during the Vietnam War and following its humiliating withdrawal from Southeast Asia, there was never any serious doubt about America’s authority and ability to deal with what was then the central strategic challenge, the Cold War.
对于饥渴而贫困的农村经济，比如中国20世纪70年代以及现在非洲的大部分地区，一个主要的出发点是提高农业生产力。	In a hungry and poor rural economy, as China was in the 1970’s and as most of Africa is today, a key starting point is to raise farm productivity.
智利经济学家和政治家卡洛斯•奥米纳米在其无所不谈的回忆录《秘密的联盟 》 （ Secretos de la Concertación）中发出疑问，如果中国经济放缓或其房地产泡沫破灭会出现什么情况。	Chilean economist and politician Carlos Ominami, in his tell-all memoir Secretos de la Concertación, wondered what would happen if China's economy slowed or its real-estate bubble burst.
但这样的反应表现出的狭隘思维，与导致梵文学者温迪·唐尼格（Wendy Doniger）的印度教著作被“化为纸浆”的臭名昭著的运动如出一辙。	But such responses reflect the same narrow-mindedness that led to the notorious “pulping” of Sanksrit scholar Wendy Doniger’s erudite books on Hinduism.
对于财政目标可以以多快速度实现，可以有回旋余地，特别是眼下已经发生了大量前期紧缩、市场对公共债务的可持续性已不再十分担忧时。	There is some flexibility in how fast the fiscal target can be achieved, especially now that a lot of front-loaded austerity has occurred and markets are less nervous about the sustainability of public debt.
毕竟，除了在政治上没有得到充分代表外，德国每年向欧盟预算提供资金(最近是74亿欧元 ) ， 遥遥领先成为最大的净贡献国。	After all, aside from political under-representation, Germany’s annual contribution to the EU budget (most recently €7.4 billion) makes the country by far the largest net contributor.
批评人士称财政调整太过缓慢无法安抚市场，而市场似乎并不关心在邻国巴西，总体预算差额为GDP的8%左右。	Critics claim that the fiscal adjustment was too slow for comfort, yet markets seem unconcerned that in neighboring Brazil the headline budget gap is 8% of GDP.
特朗普希望控制全国对话；他不需要担心他的假话连篇会使他的支持者疏远他，因为他们已经相信“自由派”媒体讨厌他们和他们所选择的总统。	Trump hopes to control the national conversation; and he need not worry that his mendacity will alienate his supporters, because they already believe that the “liberal” media detest them and the president they elected.
但当前的事态发展却几乎全部是反面证明：今天，一次又一次危机中美国领导作用的缺失彰显出美国的重要性 — — 最显而易见的例子是叙利亚危机。	But the proof has been almost entirely negative: Today, America’s importance has become apparent from the absence of US leadership in one crisis after another – an absence that is most immediately obvious in Syria.
因此从特朗普到马琳·勒庞等右翼政治家在重新确立国家地位的主张中掺入大量反穆斯林象征主义也就毫不奇怪了。	So it is not a surprise that rightist politicians from Trump to Marine Le Pen lace their message of national reassertion with a rich dose of anti-Muslim symbolism.
它成立了世界中小企业论坛（World Small and Medium Enterprise Forum ） ， 旨在加强中小企业对全球经济的贡献。	It has launched a World Small and Medium Enterprise Forum aimed at enhancing the contributions of SMEs to the global economy.
不幸的是，这些数字不能累计，而且联邦政府债务爆炸和政府低效的微观经济管理为未来经济发展埋下了两枚定时炸弹。	Unfortunately, the numbers don’t add up and he is laying twin time bombs with the explosion of federal government debt and inefficient government micromanagement of the economy.
伦敦 — — 我们被告知自己生活在一个充满焦虑的年代，需要操心的地方很多，令人安心的确定性却少之又少。	LONDON – We are told that we live in anxious times, with lots to worry about and no more comforting certainty.
在列宁掌权的时代，这并不困难：尽管新的政权造成了大量流血，但大规模杀戮并不是它的主要目的或能量来源。	This wasn’t so difficult while Lenin was in charge: despite the bloodshed the new regime engendered, mass murder wasn’t its main purpose or source of energy.
事实上，从升级自身日程的问题看，明年将是发展中亚洲的良机，而这反过来将给予发达经济体所需要的满足其自身经济潜力的灵活性和机会。	Indeed, the coming year will mark a seminal moment for developing Asia in terms of advancing its own agenda, which, in turn, will give developed economies the flexibility and opportunities that they need to fulfill their own economic potential.
但她的政府依然有三年时间推行支持服务业、初创企业和中小企业等韩国全新增长引擎兴起的改革，上述行业能在今后30年为韩国提供更有活力的创新经济。	But her government still has three years to pursue reforms that support the emergence of the services sector, start-ups, and SMEs as South Korea’s new growth engines, capable of powering a more dynamic and innovative economy for the next 30 years.
其结果是显而易见的：在关于欧洲将如何发展的斗争中，欧盟机构缺乏足够的权威或支持去投身大多数争论 — — 甚至无法完全介入讨论。	The result is clear: in the struggle over how Europe will develop, the EU institutions lack the authority or support to put up much of a fight – or even fully enter the ring.
肯尼亚的全民基本收入项目依赖M-Pesa系统 — — 它是一个在对外援助，私人企业和前瞻性政府 — — 而非善意慈善家 — — 的支持下构建的盈利性移动银行系统。	The Kenya UBI relies on M-Pesa, a for-profit mobile banking system that was built with the support of foreign aid, private companies, and a forward-looking government – not well-meaning philanthropists.
但消费品（3，700亿美元 ） 、 酒店和娱乐（2，600亿美元 ） 、 医疗保健（1，750亿美元 ） 、 金融服务（850亿美元）和电信服务（650亿美元）同样将会增长强劲。	But there will also be strong growth in consumer goods ($370 billion), hospitality and recreation ($260 billion), health care ($175 billion), financial services ($85 billion), and telecommunications ($65 billion).
这场争论代表了又一次挑起针对不受欢迎的少数族裔的偏见，并且借机在2017年大选中从极右翼国民阵线候选人马琳·勒庞手中争夺选票的机会。	The controversy represents yet another opportunity to stoke prejudice against an unpopular minority, in the hope of siphoning votes from the far-right National Front’s Marine Le Pen in the 2017 election.
在欧安组织应对乌克兰国内和周边危机的行动中，最显眼的部分是三方联络小组（Trilateral Contact Group）和特别监控任务（Special Monitoring Mission ） 。	The most visible aspects of the OSCE response to the crisis in and around Ukraine have been carried out by the Trilateral Contact Group and the Special Monitoring Mission.
但是服务提供系统却不尽人意，所以焦点转移到促进该项目的绩效，埃斯特·迪弗洛等麻省理工学院贫穷行动实验室的研究人员率先对此进行了随机对照试验。	But service delivery remained disappointing, so the focus shifted to improving project performance, which researchers like Esther Duflo at MIT’s Poverty Action Lab have pioneered with randomized controlled experiments.
这也许将有利于世界大部分经济体，但会给美国和中国造成严重后果 — — 两国消费者和依靠进口机械的企业必须付出更高的代价。	This may benefit most of the world’s economies, but it will also have serious consequences for the US and China, where consumers and enterprises relying on imported machinery will have to pay more.
相反，加密货币只有在（同一加密系统内的）所有人就谁昨天持有一个价值单位、今天又转移给谁的问题达成一致的情况下才能起作用。	By contrast, cryptocurrencies work only if everyone (within that crypto system) agrees on who held a unit of value yesterday and to whom it was transferred today.
这意味着与法国总统马克龙合作推进欧洲工程、实现德国公共管理体系现代化、促使劳动力为数字化做好准备、解决移民问题等。	This means cooperating with French President Emmanuel Macron to move the European project forward; modernizing Germany’s public administration system; preparing the labor force for digitization; and tackling immigration issues.
可是，一些制造业活动集中的沿海城市正在经历创造性破坏发展过程 — — 这是一个必须经历的过程，但会带来巨大的短期挑战。	By contrast, China’s coastal cities, where manufacturing activities are concentrated, are experiencing creative destruction – a necessary process that nonetheless presents significant short-term challenges.
让他们活得更多收入不仅能够减少贫困，还能刺激消费支出，这在需求不足继续阻碍着复苏和就业创造的时期是至关重要的。	Putting more income into their hands would not only reduce poverty; it would stimulate consumer spending at a time when inadequate demand continues to impede recovery and job creation.
新抗生素的研发难度大且投入昂贵 — — 而且关键是与癌症和糖尿病等其他重要投资领域相比带来的利润没那么多。	Developing new antibiotics is difficult and expensive – and, crucially, far less profitable than investments in other important fields, such as cancer and diabetes.
代表欧盟的一名德国发言人认为“宗教诽谤”的概念在人权背景下应视为无效，因为人权应当隶属于个人，而非隶属于机构或者宗教。	Speaking on behalf of the European Union, a German spokesperson rejected the concept of “defamation of religion” as not valid in a human rights context, because human rights belonged to individuals, not to institutions or religions.
历史上，中国人民银行每天都会在毫不顾及市场情绪的情况下制定一个人民币汇率；只允许人民币在极窄的限定范围内进行交易。	Historically, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had fixed the renminbi’s exchange rate on a daily basis, without regard to underlying market sentiment; and it had allowed for the renminbi to trade only within very narrow limits.
全球经济发展和人口不断增长给自然环境带来了前所未有的压力，而这些压力又给我们的社会带来了前所未有的挑战。	Global economic growth and rising populations are putting unprecedented stresses on the physical environment, and these stresses in turn are causing unprecedented challenges for our societies.
毕竟，地方政府拥有并经营大部分机场和港口以及水、下水道和电力等公用设施 — — 所有这些都急需资金。	After all, local governments own and operate most airports and ports, as well as utilities such as water, sewerage, and electricity – all of which are in desperate need of funding.
2003年10月的“尝试演练”未获成功，因为当时的反对党未能团结在唯一的候选人周围，在总统选举中向伊尔哈姆提出挑战。 反对派宣布选举结果有假，号召人们上街游行。	A “dress rehearsal” failed in October 2003, when the opposition, incapable of uniting around a single candidate to challenge Ilham in the presidential election, declared the results to have been falsified and called people into the streets.
上月在戴维营举行的八国集团（G8）会议上，由德国主导的针对欧元区南部问题成员国的紧缩措施遭到了强力抵制。	At last month’s G-8 meeting at Camp David, the German-led austerity program for the eurozone’s troubled southern members ran up against substantial resistance.
这样的结果将刺激其他国家的民粹主义鼓吹在大部分专家眼里毫无经济意义的孤立主义政策的力量 — — 从意大利到法国到美国都是如此。	Such an outcome will bolster populist forces elsewhere – from Italy to France to the US – in their advocacy of isolationist policies that most experts regard as economic nonsense.
正如第一财政大臣罗伯特·皮尔（Robert Peel）所写的 ： “ 在需要勇敢地承担责任的时候，我敢说，人们会乐于站出来承担责任的 。 ”	As First Lord of the Treasury Sir Robert Peel wrote: “If it be necessary to assume a grave responsibility, I dare say men will be willing to assume such a responsibility.”
1871年，法国在普法战争中惨败，深受刺激的顾拜旦第一次把通过组织运动会作为激发法国男性男子气概的方式。	Baron Pierre de Coubertin, shocked by France’s defeat in a disastrous war with Prussia in 1871, initially aimed to restore French males’ virility by encouraging organized games.
西藏和新疆没有批准军队镇压分裂主义活动的法律，但中国政府从来没有停止野蛮地迫害那里要求独立的个人和群体。	The absence of laws mandating force to block separatist activity has never stopped Chinese authorities from brutally persecuting individuals and groups who have called for an independent Tibet or Xinjiang.
这大约体现了一种观念，即，如果谈判破裂导致希腊再度爆发危机，对欧元区和更广泛的欧盟的系统风险将远小于几年前。	This largely reflects the belief that, if a breakdown of negotiations triggers another Greek crisis, the systemic risks to the eurozone and the wider European Union would be far smaller than they were just a few years ago.
2004年6月政权移交之时，众多专家预言，选举产生的国民会议将会对由非经选举产生的管理委员会起草、占领当局颁布的过渡宪法置之不理。	At the time of the transfer of authority in June of 2004, many pundits predicted that an elected National Assembly would ignore an interim constitution drafted by an unelected Governing Council and promulgated by an occupying authority.
随着中国将自身经济模式由大幅基础建设投资和大型制造业转向其他方面，许多小型工业城市开始失去其核心产业。	As China shifts its economic model away from heavy infrastructure investment and bulk manufacturing, many of these small industrial cities will lose their core industry.
换句话说，我们必须承认两个伊斯兰教陷入了一场死亡斗争，而由于战场是地球，战争威胁到西方所持有的价值，因此这场战斗不仅仅是穆斯林的事务。	In other words, we must acknowledge that two Islams are locked in a fight to the death, and that because the battlefield is the planet and the war threatens values that the West embraces, the fight is not solely the Muslims’ affair.
该学院在加州最贫困邮政编码区帮助了1,200户自愿参与家庭，并以获得资金支持在未来两年在帮助2,300户家庭。	Located in the poorest postal code in California, the program has helped 1,200 families who enrolled voluntarily and is funded to serve an additional 2,300 families over the next two years.
按照联合国粮农组织总干事 何塞·格拉齐亚诺·达席尔瓦的话讲，生物燃料“可以成为强化粮食安全的有效途径 。 ”	In the words of José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, biofuels “can be an effective means to increase food security.”
评估过度专业细分是否已在德国发生，必须把注意力改换集中到劳动力市场，因为专业细分进程就是在这里组织的。	To assess whether excessive specialization has occurred in Germany, we must focus on the labor market, for it is here that the effect of specialization is most visible.
这凸显出一个更大的问题：欧盟缺少足够强的统一叙事以阻止其内部出现互相冲突 — — 并且极具破坏力 — — 的不同叙事。	This highlights a larger problem: the European Union lacks a unifying narrative strong enough to prevent the emergence of conflicting – and highly destructive – narratives within its borders.
随着美国众议院被置于“新管理层”之下（包括创纪录的民主党女议员人数 ） ， 特朗普有了一个诱人的目标。	With the US House of Representatives under “new management,” including a record number of Democratic women, Trump has a tempting target.
但这些潜在的好处只有在美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马给予印度问题以应有的重视，并允许印美两国私有部门参与进来，解决单靠政府解决不了的问题从而加大战略赌注时才有可能实现。	But these potential gains will be realized only if US President Barack Obama gives India the attention it deserves, and if both countries broaden the strategic stake by involving their private sectors in issues that governments alone cannot resolve.
总体而言，由于政府可以依靠出口收入而无需同其社会“妥协 ” ， 因此，类似石油、天然气、钻石以及其他稀有金属的天然资源会促生腐败。	In general, natural resources like oil, gas, diamonds, and other precious minerals breed corruption, because governments can live off of their export earnings without having to “compromise” with their own societies.
但尽管各国政府全力以赴，在2015年的既定期限之前全部达成这些目标的可能性对于很多国家而言还是微乎其微，更别说非洲了。	But, despite the best efforts of governments, reaching those goals by the 2015 target date still remains a distant prospect for many countries, not the least of in Africa.
特朗普知道欧洲在资金、技术和专门技能领域有能力成为与美国对等的全球大国，而欧洲缺乏充分发挥潜能的意愿不该由他来负责。	Trump knows that the EU has the money, technology, and know-how to be a global power equal to the US, and it is not his problem that Europe lacks the political will to harness its full potential.
看起来有两个因素非常重要。 第一，美国的经济、政治以及教育领域相对宽松，允许移民进入这些美国生活中的主要领域。	Two factors seem significant: first, relatively porous economic, political and educational arenas that allow immigrants entry to these key areas of American life.
而即便是那些相对准备较充分的国家都痛苦地感受到了一连串后危机效应：出口市场严重萎缩，商品价格下滑，以及信贷市场失灵。	Even those countries that were better prepared were made painfully aware of the after-effects of crisis: export markets collapsed, commodity prices fell, and credit markets seized up.
在大学这个个案中，这就意味着允许那些因不具备思想、政治或财政资源而无法独立得出研究成果的学生掌握相关知识。	In the case of the university, this means allowing access to knowledge to students who lack the intellectual, political, or financial resources that might have enabled them to produce it for themselves.
衰老的欧洲需要有活力的年轻人干本地人不愿意干（或缺少技能干）的工作、为老年人的医疗费用买单、开办企业、追求提振经济增长的新点子。	A graying continent needs dynamic young workers to do jobs that locals spurn (or for which they lack the skills), pay for and care for the old, start businesses, and pursue spark new ideas that boost economic growth.
中国真正的核心利益并不在领土扩张和称霸四邻，���在于提升人权和改善中国人民的福利，这也是世界对中国的核心利益。	China’s real core interests are not in territorial expansion and hegemony over its neighbors, but in upholding the human rights and improving the welfare of its own citizens, which is the world’s core interest in China.
同样，所谓的“社会基金 ” ， 由于需要社区设计项目并争取资金，也提升了发展项目的参与度和“拥有度 ” （ “ownership ” ） 。	Similarly, so-called “Social Funds,” whereby communities design projects and compete for money, have enhanced participation and “ownership” of development projects.
伦敦—在上周四的罗马会议上，欧元区四大经济体领导人就迈向银行联盟和温和刺激方案以补充欧元区新“财政契约”的步骤达成了一致。	LONDON – At their meeting in Rome last Thursday, the leaders of the eurozone’s four largest economies agreed on steps towards a banking union and a modest stimulus package to complement the European Union’s new “fiscal compact.”
而尽管英国和新西兰等国家尝试了授予央行规定贷款-价值比上限的权力，但对美国来说，这仍然是“遥远的桥 ” 。	And, while countries like the United Kingdom and New Zealand have experimented with giving central banks the power to place ceilings on loan-to-value ratios, this remains a bridge too far in the United States.
研究者对41个最贫穷国家的十种疾病的儿童接种的健康和经济影响进行了建模，测算出这些疫苗在2016—2030年可以防止3,600万例死亡。	By modeling the health and economic impact of childhood vaccines for ten diseases in 41 of the poorest countries, the researchers estimate that from 2016 to 2030, these vaccines will prevent 36 million deaths.
当欧盟坚持拒绝对年轻一代爱尔兰人肩上不公平的负担进行合理债务减免时，爱尔兰却仍然确信欧盟为了外国银行的权益来损害本国主权的做法是正确的。	With the EU still refusing meaningful reduction of a debt burden unfairly borne by the younger generation, the Irish remain convinced, correctly, that the EU violated their sovereignty on behalf of foreign bankers.
事实上，东盟长期以来一直以其“开放的区域主义”而备受赞誉，因为它在成员国之间追求经济一体化的同时也不会歧视其他非东盟经济体。	Indeed, the bloc has long been praised for its “open regionalism,” whereby it pursues economic integration among member states without discriminating against non-ASEAN economies.
他们是反卡扎菲的先锋队，有突尼斯和埃及同胞成功先例可循，且在利比亚这个保守穆斯林国家拥有宗教象征的宣传优势。	They spearheaded the opposition to Qaddafi, were advised by their Tunisian and Egyptian brethren, and larded their rhetoric with religious symbolism in a conservative Muslim country.
管理全球风险挑战的重要性并不亚于避免“历史结束 ” — —这种结束不是自由民主全球胜利的卓越巅峰，而是我们能够想象得到的最可怕的集体失利。	The challenge of governing global risks is nothing less than the challenge of preventing the “end of history” – not as the placid apotheosis of liberal democracy’s global victory, but as the worst collective failure we can imagine.
过度负债不但导致了2008年危机，20世纪90年代的东亚危机和80年代的拉美危机也是拜过度负债所赐。	Excessive debt caused not only the 2008 crisis, but also the East Asia crisis in the 1990s and the Latin American crisis in the 1980s.
至于稳定大气层中二氧化碳水平的代价，根据《斯特恩报告》的预计，在国民生产总值3.5%到-3.9%的范围内（因为节约能源减少了能源成本，后一预计数字并不像它看起来那么惊人 ） 。	As for the cost of stabilization, estimates in the Stern Review range from 3.4% of GNP to -3.9% (since saving energy reduces energy costs, the latter estimate is not as startling as it appears).
举例来说，如果那些燃煤发电厂希望自己能继续作为能源供给结构的重要组成部分存在的话，那么就要应用捕获并储存二氧化碳的技术，这个技术过程被称为“碳捕捉和封存 ” （ 简称CCS ） ， 但却还未经研究证明有效。	For example, coal plants, if they are to remain a major part of the energy mix, will need to capture and store their CO2, a process called “carbon capture and sequestration,” or CCS for short. Yet this technology remains unproved.
有鉴于此，特郎普的崛起对美国犹太人而言是个非常坏的消息 — — 而且实际上所有美国少数族裔群体都应为此而感到担忧。	Given this, Trump’s rise is very bad news for American Jews – and, indeed, all of America’s minority groups.
他提前一个月向市场透露行动计划，使用“警惕”一类的暗号来提示政策变动。 同时他又总是一脸严肃地表示ECB从不“预先承诺”其政策立场。	He tips them off about what he plans to do one month in advance, using code words like “vigilance” to signal policy change, all the while maintaining with a straight face that the bank never “pre-commits” its policy stance.
这些行动方坚持私有化、去监管化以及资本市场和贸易的自由化 — — 即所谓的华盛顿共识 — — 这套政策肥了商界和金融精英，导致了剧烈的危机，也破坏了新兴经济体增长。	These actors’ insistence on privatization, deregulation, and liberalization of capital markets and trade – the so-called Washington Consensus – enriched business and financial elites, led to acute crises, and undermined emerging economies’ growth.
"环境援助资金的年平均数额约为20亿美金-远低于国际社会首先在1992年的""里约峰会""及后在2002年的""约翰内斯堡峰会""上声明的数额。"	Aid for the environment averaged about $2 billion per year - far short of what the international community, first at the Rio Summit in 1992 and then at the Johannesburg Summit ten years later, said was needed.
联合国工业发展组织全力支持合作伙伴调动资源，同时为非洲国家提供了国家伙伴关系项目（PCP）这样一个经过验证的模式。	UNIDO has put its full support behind partnerships for mobilizing resources, and is offering a tested model for African countries to follow: the Programme for Country Partnership (PCP).
此外，与西方不同，中国专门以股市为目标的措施使得流动性溢出至其他资产市场从而造成金融传染的风险降到最低。	And, unlike in the West, China’s targeted equity-specific actions minimize the risk of financial contagion caused by liquidity spillovers into other asset markets.
总债务（政府、家庭、非金融企业和金融机构债务之和）略高于GDP的315 % ， 与瑞士（313 % ） 、法国（323 % ） 、美国（296 % ） 甚至德国（285 % ） 差别不大（均为2009年数字 ） 。	Aggregate debt (government, household, non-financial corporations, and financial institutions) is slightly more than 315% of GDP, similar to Switzerland (313%), France (323%), the United States (296%), and even Germany (285%), all 2009 numbers.
在我们这个全球化的世界,一个国家的最佳产业结构，即所有的产业都符合国家的相对优势，在国内国际市场具有竞争优势，这种产业结构是由该国的禀赋结构所决定的。	In our globalized world, a country’s optimal industrial structure – in which all industries are consistent with the country’s comparative advantages and are competitive in domestic and international markets – is determined by its endowment structure.
虽然它与GDP有着基本的关系，但 GNI 与我们这个全球化时代更相关，因为它针对外国企业和外国居民所产生的收入进行了调整。	Though it shares fundamental elements with GDP, GNI is more relevant to our globalized age, because it adjusts for income generated by foreign-owned corporations and foreign residents.
马德里 — — 在整个后二战全球秩序遭唐纳德·特朗普这位新晋总统质疑的令人眼花缭乱的几个月后，地缘政治现状似乎已重新成为主流。	MADRID – After a dizzying few months, in which Donald Trump’s young presidency called into question the entire post-World War II global order, the geopolitical status quo appears to have reemerged.
在一些以色列战略学者的思维中，以色列还必须继续坚持两三代人的时间，使这个国家变成该区域的一个不可更改的存在以及国际体系中一个合法的“既成事实 ” 。	In the minds of a few Israeli strategic thinkers, Israel must resist firmly for two or three more generations in order to become an irreversible reality in the region and a legitimate “accomplished fact” of the international system.
他不但声称伊朗的战略应该是进攻性的，而不是防御性的，还威胁说，如果以色列胆敢和伊朗伊斯兰共和国动武的话，哈马斯和黎巴嫩真主党将对特拉维夫发动袭击。	He not only argued that Iran’s strategy should be offensive rather than defensive, but also threatened that Tel Aviv would be attacked by Hamas and Hezbollah if Israel went to war with the Islamic Republic.
民意调查显示欧盟民众理解有必要在欧盟范围内建立控制金融行业（尤其是跨境金融行业）的框架、管理难民潮并落实应对气候变化及减轻其影响的各项措施。	Opinion polls show that EU citizens understand the need for a Europe-wide framework to control the financial sector (particularly cross-border banking), manage refugee flows, and implement measures to fight climate change and mitigate its effects.
身水身汗，如果放任产能过剩继续给物价造成下降压力，中国的经济增长将无法稳定在与其潜力一致的水平上；相反，中国经济将陷入债务通缩的恶性循环。	In fact, if overcapacity is allowed to continue putting downward pressure on prices, China’s economic growth will not stabilize at a rate consistent with its potential; instead, the economy will be pushed into a vicious spiral of debt deflation.
简言之，全球经济的核心占据着一个无法正常运转的政治机制，这套机制时不时发出世界主要储备资产违约的风险。	Simply put, the global economy has at its center a dysfunctional political regime that generates recurrent threats of default on the world’s major reserve asset.
如果2067年想要成为上述突破合格的百年纪念日，那么现在的动荡必须激励世界领导人竭尽全力制定并落实创造更加繁荣、平等和稳定未来所需的创新政策。	If 2067 is to be a fitting centenary for these breakthroughs, the current turmoil must motivate world leaders to work to develop and implement the novel policies we need to create a more prosperous, equitable, and stable future.
相反，与潜在未来损失相比，欧洲银行最近留存的资本仍显太少 — — 切这笔资本是通过会计花招变出来的，而不是真正的用于吸收损失的股本金。	On the contrary, compared to their likely future losses, European banks have raised relatively little capital recently – and much of this has been creative accounting, rather than truly loss-absorbing shareholder equity.
此外，还不确定EIB是否能够从再保人那里得到更多的支持以帮助他们控制发行这种债券可能出现的风险，因为再保人还不知道他们如何能全面防范相关的风险。	Moreover, it is not clear that the EIB can get further help from reinsurers in managing the risks it assumes by issuing such bonds because reinsurers do not yet see how they can fully hedge the risks involved.
在对华关系方面，他不仅威胁要征收关税，而且还可能推翻他前任共和党和民主党总统几十年来一贯秉承的“一个中国”政策。	With regard to China, he has not only threatened to impose tariffs, but also raised the possibility that he will defy the “One China” policy that his predecessors, Republicans and Democrats alike, have respected for decades.
最明显的例子，莫过于原本似乎神圣不可侵犯 — — 而且费用也居世界前列 — — 的公共服务和社会福利不再是政治禁区，并将遭到削减。	It is clear, for example, that the sacred cows of public services and social benefits – among the most extensive in the world – will not remain untouched. Both will be subject to cuts.
非金融企业实现了恢复力和灵活性兼具，这与世界范围内不少家庭和政府所面临的的情况 — — 过度杠杆留下的后遗症 — — 形成了鲜明对比。	Non-financial firms have achieved a mix of resilience and agility that contrasts sharply with prevailing conditions for some households and governments around the world that have yet to confront adequately a legacy of over-leverage.
但是，欧洲的首要能源消费者是个体家庭，如果有正确的政治领导、足够的投资和欧洲人自身的长期承诺，未来几年家庭能源效率可以提高两倍。	Rather, the principal energy consumer in Europe is individual households, where energy efficiency can be tripled in the coming years with the right political leadership, sufficient investment, and long-term commitment from Europeans themselves.
在新书《现金的诅咒 》 （ The Curse of Cash）中肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）主张取消高面额钞票以打击逃税和犯罪行为。	In a new book, The Curse of Cash, Kenneth Rogoff champions the elimination of high-denomination notes in order to fight tax evasion and criminal activity.
10月12日，俄罗斯海军联合战略火箭部队进行了一场十分协调的演习，演习期间还从不同的地面和潜艇发射平台试射了三个远程弹道导弹，进行了同时发射试验。	On October 12, the Russian Navy joined with the Strategic Rocket Forces to conduct a well-integrated exercise involving near-simultaneous testing of three long-range ballistic missiles from separate ground and submarine launch platforms.
考虑到一直困扰着巴西的制度动荡和2005、2006年几乎吞噬卢拉政府的系列重大腐败丑闻，这一成绩的取得绝非易事。	There is nothing modest about that achievement, given Brazil’s traditional institutional instability and the series of major corruption scandals that engulfed Lula’s government in 2005 and 2006.
巴黎 — — 亚历西斯·托克维尔在《论美国民主》一书中指出公众信任可以缓解政府压力，提高政府的运作效率。	PARIS – In Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville argued that the public’s trust alleviates pressure on the state, allowing it to function more effectively.
同样，由伊布哈迪斯和逊尼派统治的阿曼与伊朗关系密切，它与伊朗而非沙特共同拥有霍尔木兹海峡关键油运航道的控制权。	Similarly, Oman, dominated by Ibhadis and Sunnis, has a closer relationship with Iran, with which it shares control of the vital oil-shipping lanes in the Strait of Hormuz, than it does with Saudi Arabia.
更能说明问题的是，朔伊布勒为欧洲中央银行“直接货币交易”计划（这将允许欧洲央行无限量购买较弱欧元区国家的政府债券）的辩护。	More revealing is Schäuble’s defense of the European Central Bank’s “outright monetary transactions” scheme (which would permit the ECB to purchase unlimited amounts of weaker eurozone countries’ government bonds).
但这在逻辑上是不成立的：随着实际贬值的发生，即使通缩了，实际购买力也会想将，而债务的实际价值会升高（债务通缩 ） 。	But that is logically flawed: even with deflation, real purchasing power would fall, and the real value of debts would rise (debt deflation), as the real depreciation occurs.
因此必须要实现某种平衡：国际社会必须让15亿人摆脱贫困，同时要限制世界最富裕消费者导致绝大部分生态退化的过度消费行为。	So a balance must be struck: the global community must lift 1.5 billion people out of poverty, while the excesses of the world’s richest consumers – which cause the vast majority of ecological degradation – must be limited.
美国经济增速有可能会加快；特朗普可能以某种方式通过一些促进增长的政策；而且欧洲的增长可能会逐渐减弱。	The US economy could start to grow at a faster rate; Trump might somehow get some of his growth-boosting policies enacted; and Europe’s growth may taper off.
纽约—美国总统特朗普的政府和国会共和党多数“取消和取代”2010年平价医疗法 （ “ 奥巴马医保 ” ） 失败，现在，他们转向了税收改革。	NEW YORK – Having failed to “repeal and replace” the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”), US President Donald Trump’s administration and the Republican congressional majority have now moved on to tax reform.
因此，2014年也许将是有历史纪录以来最暖的一年，也是灾难性干旱、洪水、高影响风暴和热浪频发的一年。	As a result, 2014 is now likely to be the warmest year in recorded history, a year that has also brought devastating droughts, floods, high-impact storms, and heat waves.
但是汇率确实会影响经济的增长方式。 脱离对出口引导的增长形式的高度依赖，重组增长结构，是符合中国自身利益的。	But exchange rates do affect the pattern of growth, and it is in China’s own interest to restructure and move away from high dependence on export-led growth.
所谓的“武器出口三大原则”对那些原本可以出售或向国外提供的武器作了荒谬的限制，甚至连用于海上救援的水上飞机也被禁止出口。	And the so-called “three principles on arms exports” have placed absurd limits on what may be sold or supplied abroad, as even flying boats used for sea rescue have been viewed as banned from export.
amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 伯克利 - - 全球金融危机给欧元即将崩溃这一老生常谈注入了新的生命力。	BERKELEY – The global financial crisis has breathed new life into hoary arguments about the euro’s imminent demise.
2012年，极右翼的国民阵线领导人马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）将作为宗教象征的犹太圆顶小帽和作为政治象征的面纱相提并论（为了同时谴责它们 ） 。	In 2012, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, lumped together (in order to condemn them both) the religious symbol that is the yarmulke and the political emblem that is the veil.
2005年联合国大会一致通过的保护责任原则（在某种程度上为了应对10年前卢旺达的种族灭绝行动）的前提是政府有义务保护本国公民免受人身伤害。	Adopted unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly in 2005 (partly in response to Rwanda’s genocide a decade earlier), R2P was premised on the notion that governments are obliged to protect their citizens from physical harm.
但这些组织却最终导致暴力局势进一步恶化，它们在这场近五十年的漫长冲突中发挥了不可忽视的作用，导致平民因此而失去土地、流离失所。	But these organizations ultimately exacerbated violence, generated land dispossession and forced displacement, and helped to prolong the conflict for nearly five decades.
中国的外交政策之所以散乱无序，其原因在于中国领导层无力影响和塑造其国内政治动向：许多中国人仍旧将负隅顽抗的小国朝鲜当做自己的朋友和盟友。	The origin of China’s desultory policy lies in its leadership’s failure to shape or sharpen the drift of domestic politics: many Chinese still see plucky little North Korea as a friend and ally.
对预言了同名事件的约翰内斯·斯蒂尔（Johannes Steele）1934年的著作《第二次世界大战 》 （ The Second World War）的关注表明，对大战的担忧一定获得了大量的讨论，足以导致某些犹豫。	The attention devoted to Johannes Steele’s 1934 book The Second World War, which predicted that eponymous event, indicates that fear of war must have been talked about enough to underpin some hesitation.
但我们却没有这样做，我们只是从2008年的金融海啸中侥幸生还，又在同一个地方进行重建，又走上了同一条错误金融路线，用的也还是那个有缺陷的设计。	Instead, we survived the financial tsunami of 2008, only to rebuild in the same place, on the main financial fault-lines, using the same flawed design.
其次，对新一代学生来说，凯恩斯的重要性与其说在于他所提出的针对失业的具体办法，不如说在于他对经济学所提出的批评 — — 基于不现实的假设建立模型。	Second, for new generations of students, Keynes’s relevance may lie less in his specific remedies for unemployment than in his criticism of his profession for modeling on the basis of unreal assumptions.
但阿巴斯还面临着哈马斯的拒不让步，自2006年以来，哈马斯一直控制着加沙，其对暴力的坚持堪称内塔尼亚胡“通过强大实现和平”理念的镜像。	But Abbas has his own intransigents in the form of Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2006, and whose commitment to violence is a mirror image of Netanyahu’s “peace through strength.”
此外，不少以愤怒的中产阶级为成员主题的重要机构，比如国家审计署（Comptroller and Auditor General）和司法部，也开始了调查。	Moreover, key institutions, such as the Comptroller and Auditor General and the judiciary, staffed by an increasingly angry middle class, also launched investigations.
如果餐厅和食品制造商不愿自觉停止使用反型脂肪（就像荷兰的情况那样 ） ， 那么如下几点就足以确认立法干预降低反型脂肪消费的必要性和重要性：	If restaurants and food manufacturers will not voluntarily eliminate trans fats (as has largely been done in the Netherlands), several points validate the need for, and the importance, of legislative measures to reduce the consumption of trans fats:
坎布里奇 — — 上个月，荷兰人举办了2015年网络空间全球会议。 那次会议吸引了近2，000名政府官员、学者、行业代表和其他人士。	CAMBRIDGE – Last month, the Netherlands hosted the Global Conference on Cyberspace 2015, which brought together nearly 2,000 government officials, academics, industry representatives, and others.
由共和党支持的对民主党总统在本党全力支持下所谈关键协议的讨伐已经对以色列美国事业的两党基础构成了威胁。	The Republican-backed crusade against a key agreement negotiated by a Democratic president, with his party’s overwhelming support, has threatened the bipartisan foundations of Israel’s cause in America.
因此，我和其他考虑降低预算的人重���关注改变税收规则以限制被称为“税收支出”的特别项（即税法中的政府支出 ） 。	That’s why I and others who think about shrinking the deficit focus on changing tax rules to limit the special features known as “tax expenditures,” which represent government spending built into the tax code.
为了有效、合理地定向，各国所采取的政策需要对增长潜力进行精准判断，并在可贸易和不可贸易部分双管齐下。	To be effective and properly targeted, policies need to include an accurate diagnosis of growth potential and impediments in both the tradable and non-tradable parts of the economy.
就像这些都还不够糟一样，达沃斯论坛开幕时美国众议院通过了一项议案，要求经济刺激方案下进行的花费必须使用美国钢铁，虽然20国集团（G-20）呼吁避免采取保护主义来应对危机。	As if all this were not enough, as the Davos meeting opened, America’s House of Representatives passed a bill requiring American steel to be used in stimulus spending, despite the G-20’s call to avoid protectionism in response to the crisis.
其他任何想得到的货币联盟模式 — — 包括基于如欧洲央行那样的不可问责的中央银行的模式 — — 也将遭到拒绝。	Any other conceivable model of monetary union – including one based on a central bank as unaccountable as the European Central Bank – would be subject to the same rejection.
虽然真实的微观经济模型确实比它们的理���化教材版本更为复杂，但掌握它们并不一定就需要多年的研究经验。	While it is true that realistic microeconomic models are more complex than their idealized textbook counterparts, grasping them does not necessarily require years of research experience.
事实上，德国、日本和中国等出口导向型经济的成功很大程度上要归功于美国吸收大部分全球出口的能力 — — 它们也需要继续花钱请美国扮演这一角色。	In fact, export-oriented economies like Germany, Japan, and China owe much of their success to America’s capacity to absorb a massive share of global exports – and they need to keep paying America to play this role.
美国在2000年代中期不断扩大的经常项目赤字实际上是资产和信贷市场形成危险泡沫时期转向依赖资产的储蓄所造成的扭曲的明显警告。	America’s gaping current-account deficit of the mid-2000’s was, in fact, a glaring warning of the distortions created by a shift to asset-dependent saving at a time when dangerous bubbles were forming in asset and credit markets.
这有些时候会起作用，但是据称，试图让美国更加公开地参与巴基斯坦的政治不会巩固反而会削弱其掌控的大权。	This worked for some time, but an alleged attempt to involve the United States more openly in Pakistani politics weakened, rather than strengthened, his hold on power.
在2017年针对外国直接投资流入限制的经合组织评比中，中国在60多个国家中的排名甚至在菲律宾，沙特阿拉伯和印尼之后。	In 2017, China ranked behind only the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia among the 60-plus countries rated by the OECD according to the restrictiveness of their inward FDI regimes.
卢梭对城市化的恶劣影响深信不疑，以至于他“宁愿看到人们在草地上拔草吃，也不愿目睹他们在城市中相互吞噬 。 ”	Rousseau was so convinced of the malign effects of urbanization that he “would rather see men grazing on meadow grass than devouring each other in cities.”
首先，中国与周边许多邻国（包括日本，越南和菲律宾）的领土纠纷正不断威胁区域稳定，更别提对经济一体化的影响了。	For starters, China’s territorial disputes with many of its neighbors, including Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines, are undermining regional peace, not to mention economic integration.
正如那个由加州大学伯克莱分校一帮电脑迷在1980年代组建的“家庭电脑组装俱乐部”一样，当时很多人都是从组装小元件起家，最后意识到一个巨大的商业机会已经降临到自己头上。	Like the founders of the Homebrew Computer Club, a seminal group of Berkeley computer geeks who got together in the 1980’s, many started by rigging up gadgets and later realized that they had come across a commercial opportunity.
按照现实技术，那些 公开承认 的较难的铀浓缩活动才更应该被称作核武器计划，因为这才是原子弹的核心来源。	In light of the technical realities, it would have been more accurate to designate the difficult and openly acknowledged enrichment activity as the nuclear weapons program, for this is what can supply the guts of an atomic bomb.
贝卢斯科尼确实在按照精英公司的方法治国：如同私人采邑一样提拔亲信、威吓批评者，用大把金钱换取人们如奴婢般的忠诚。	Berlusconi did indeed run Italy the way he runs his companies: like a private fiefdom, promoting cronies, intimidating critics, and paying people vast sums of money in exchange for their slavish devotion.
在2012年，破产的希腊政府向欧洲纳税人借了410亿欧元（折合450亿美元，或相当于希腊不断萎缩的国民收入的22 ％ ） 来注资该国无力偿付的商业银行。	In 2012, the insolvent Greek state borrowed €41 billion ($45 billion, or 22% of Greece’s shrinking national income) from European taxpayers to recapitalize the country’s insolvent commercial banks.
当世界商品价格上涨时（如过去十年那样 ） ， 习惯于市场决定的国内价格的公民更有可能接受官员无法将他们与冲击隔离开来的现实。	When world commodity prices rise, as they often have over the last decade, citizens who are accustomed to the domestic price being set in the market are more likely to accept the reality that officials cannot insulate them from the shock.
除了与2009年底、2009年初的全球金融危机的大乱象，从2004年到2014年期间，货币崩溃非常罕见（见图 ） 。	Excluding the mayhem associated with the global financial crisis of late 2008 and early 2009, currency crashes were few and far between from 2004 to 2014 (see figure).
雅加达省省长佐科维也将面临类似的挑战，如果他赢得7月印尼总统大选的话。 因为他所在的印尼民主斗争党（Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle）不可能赢得议会多数。	Jokowi, the governor of Jakarta, will face a similar challenge if he wins Indonesia’s presidential election in July, given that his party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, will not have a majority in parliament.
但有主权的苏格兰政府可能会商量取得豁免 — — 这样做将让它加入其他寻求走出欧洲货币联盟犯下的大错的欧洲国家的行列。	But a sovereign Scottish government might try to negotiate an exemption to this rule – and, in so doing, join the tide of other European countries seeking a way out of the great blunder that Europe’s monetary union has turned out to be.
7月4日，脱欧阵营最高调、最极端的领袖法拉奇（Nigel Farage）决定辞去英国独立党领导人的职位，他说 ， “ 我想找回我的生活 。 ”	When Nigel Farage, one of the Leave campaign’s most vociferous and extreme leaders, decided to step down as leader of the UK Independence Party on July 4, he said, “I want my life back.”
社会民主党于1994年重新上台，但接受了比尔特的心财政政策，甚至还在1998年推出了革命性的退休改革，将福利与支付合理地挂钩起来。	The Social Democrats returned to power in 1994, but they accepted Bildt’s new fiscal policies, and even carried out a revolutionary pension reform in 1998 that properly tied benefits to payments.
去年的巴黎袭击应当已经表明无国界恐怖主义需要无国界的情报，但欧盟成员国却依然关注个体主权胜于集体安全。	The attacks in Paris last November should have made it obvious that borderless terrorism demands borderless intelligence, yet EU member states continue to put individual sovereignty ahead of collective security.
这些数据很有可能为谷歌、脸书和其他技术巨头们带来麻烦，因为像传统媒体机构一样，它们的业务也同样依赖于人们的信任。	These figures will likely trouble Google, Facebook, and other tech giants whose businesses are no less reliant on trust than traditional media organizations.
欧盟不应该把利比亚干预视为例外，而应该认识到加强其在捍卫全球安全中的角色的必要性 — — 不仅仅是捍卫其自身获得繁荣稳定周边环境的利益。	Instead of viewing that intervention as an anomaly, the EU should recognize the need to enhance its role in defending global security – not least to uphold its own interest in a prosperous and stable neighborhood.
奥巴马已经表示在保护其他纳税人的前提下如果税收改革对排名前2-3%人群税额的提高幅度至少与税率提高相等，那么他愿意考虑这种方式。	Obama has signaled that he is willing to consider this approach, provided it increases tax revenues from the top 2-3% by at least the same amount as higher rates while protecting other taxpayers.
联合国的千年发展目标（Millennium Development Goals）承诺 — — 其中包括四个健康相关目标、覆盖了营养、母婴健康和传染病 — — 体现了改善全球健康的政治共识。	The UN’s commitment to the Millennium Development Goals – which included four health-related targets, covering nutrition, maternal and child health, and infectious diseases – reflected a political consensus to improve health worldwide.
新的基于网络的平台让普通人 — — 没钱也没有特殊技能 — — 共享汽车、闲置房间甚至DIY工具，从而对全球公司的主导构成了挑战。	New Web-based platforms allow ordinary people �� without money or special skills – to share their cars, spare bedrooms, or even do-it-yourself tools, thus challenging the dominance of global corporations.
而最激进的例子发生在中国，时间仅仅50余年 — — 红卫兵摧毁佛寺，焚烧儒家著作（事实上是一切旧的、传统的东西 ） ， 拉开了文化大革命的帷幕。	The most radical example occurred in China only a little more than 50 years ago, when Red Guards destroyed Buddhist temples and burned Confucian books – or indeed anything old and traditional – to herald the Cultural Revolution.
但普京最近对俄罗斯联邦议会的讲话与其说是一个崛起帝国的战斗呐喊，还不如说反应了普京对俄地缘政治边缘化的不满情绪。	But Putin’s recent address to Russia’s Federal Assembly was more a reflection of his resentment of Russia’s geopolitical marginalization than a battle cry from a rising empire.
受助国政府可能滥用援助致使援助无法抵达支出或投资者手中；援助金可能存在条件，必须花在来自援助国的商品和服务上。	Recipient governments might misuse the aid, preventing it from trickling down to those who would spend or invest it, or the money may be given on the condition that it is spent on goods or services from the donor country.
当月戛纳举行G20峰会时，意大利（以及欧洲）岌岌可危，而贝卢斯科尼政府在减少意大利债务利息支付负担所必须的政策方面分裂为两个阵营。	At the time of the G-20 summit in Cannes that month, Italy – and Europe – was dangerously close to collapse, with Berlusconi’s government deeply divided about the fiscal measures needed to bring down the country’s debt-service costs.
如果特朗普任职期间兑现他在虚伪粗俗竞选活动时所作出的承诺，他有可能会破坏一项复杂的创造，这项创造耗费了数十年才得以完成，并已经惠及了成百上千万的民众。	If Trump does in office what he promised to do during his crude and mendacious campaign, he could wreck a highly sophisticated creation, one that took several decades to develop and has benefited billions of people.
我在近著《思维、现代性和疯病 》 （ Mind, Modernity, Madness）中说明了严重精神疾病如此集中高发于发达西方的原因在于西方社会的性质。	As I argue in my recent book Mind, Modernity, Madness, the reason for high concentrations of severe mental illness in the developed West lies in the very nature of Western societies.
关税将立即损害美国消费者的利益，而其他国家的报复性防御措施可能给已经十分虚弱的世界贸易造成致命一击，从而动摇全球繁荣的关键源头。	Tariffs would immediately hurt American consumers, and defensive, retaliatory responses from other countries could fatally undermine already feeble world trade, thus choking off a critical source of global prosperity.
智利设立了一个按周期调整的财政平衡目标，即，在考虑了商品价格和国内产出与趋势水平的离差之��，必须实现财政平衡。	Chile sets a target for its cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance – that is, the balance that emerges after accounting for the deviations in commodity prices and domestic output from their trends.
不幸的是，由前任立法机关最后一刻仓促颁布的这一新法存在一个愚蠢的公式，并不保证在参议院获得同样安全的多数票。	Unfortunately, the new law – hastily enacted at the last minute of the previous legislature – has a silly formulation that does not guarantee an equally safe majority in the Senate.
他已开始着手根除贪污、限制行政审批权、削减国有部门的权力、明确土地的产权、提升福利、税收和金融监管的透明度及公平性等改革。	He is already working to eliminate graft, restrict the scope of administrative approvals, reduce the state-owned sector’s advantages, clarify property rights in land, and simplify welfare, tax, and financial regulations.
当年经济金融化是目标，新自由主义是它的意识形态外衣，保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker）时代的美联储加息则是它的 触发器，总统比尔·克林顿（Bill Clinton）在位时最为接近这种浮士德式的魔鬼交易。	Financialization of the economy was the goal, neoliberalism was its ideological cloak, the Paul Volcker-era Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes were its trigger, and President Bill Clinton was the ultimate closer of the Faustian bargain.
但该工厂工人的工资并不由他们卓越的生产率决定，而由他们若回到闹饥荒之前的爱尔兰的土豆地能赚到多少决定。	But the factory workers’ wages were set not by their extraordinary productivity, but by what they would earn if they returned to the potato fields of pre-famine Ireland.
其实两国在减轻艾滋病危害方面已经接受了足量的的国际援助：大部分资金来自于联合国全球防治艾滋病、结核病和疟疾基金会。	International aid supports harm-reduction efforts in both countries on a modest scale: most of the money comes from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
工程专家将向美国国会建议如何对每一种碳基原材料征税，使最后的效果等于每吨二氧化碳征收40美元（或其他任何想要的税收总额 ） 。	Engineering experts can advise the US Congress how much to tax each type of carbon-based raw material to achieve a tax equal to $40 per ton of CO2 (or whatever level of overall tax is desired).
这份遗产依旧在所谓“前线组织”认知的阴暗世界中盘恒：那些真正的“外国代理人”虽然表面上独立且致力于有价值的事业，但是受到外国的秘密控制。	It is a legacy still mired in the murky world of “front organizations”: real “foreign agents,” apparently independent and devoted to worthy causes, but secretly controlled from abroad.
按照维基解密的说法，前总理优素福·拉扎·吉拉尼批准美国发动无人机袭击，表示 ： “ 只要他们找对目标我并不反对他们这样做。	According to WikiLeaks, former Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani approved the US drone strikes, saying: “I don’t care if they do it as long as they get the right people.
自此以后，流血事件的陡然增加让和平谈判的希望更加渺茫了，甚至说已经完全扼杀了谈判希望，巴沙尔的反对者不会接受任何让巴沙尔不下台的安排。	Since then, the sharp rise in bloodshed has made it increasingly unlikely, or even impossible, that Assad’s opponents would consent to any arrangement that kept him in power.
根据联合国的数据，2002年美国的人均温室气体排放高出印度16倍，孟加拉国60倍，比埃塞俄比亚、马里或者乍得高出200倍以上。	According to United Nations figures, in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the US were 16 times higher than in India, 60 times higher than in Bangladesh, and more than 200 times higher than in Ethiopia, Mali, or Chad.
说真的，美国的低利率虽然作为一种应对金融危机的国内措施无可厚非，但它加剧了全球套息交易 — — 投机者借入美元，投向受危机冲击较小的主要新兴市场经济体。	Indeed, low US interest rates, though an appropriate domestic response to the financial crisis, have pushed a global carry trade in which people borrow in dollars to fund investments in the apparently less crisis-hit large emerging-market economies.
扑热息痛依然是为感染哮喘的儿童或成人解热或镇痛的首选药物，因为阿斯匹林或其他不含类固醇的消炎药可能会使存在该症状的易感人群反复感染哮喘。	Paracetamol also remains the preferred drug to relieve pain or fever in children or adults with asthma, because aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may provoke attacks of asthma in susceptible people with this condition.
进一步压缩已然孱弱不堪的国内储蓄头寸意味着经常项目和贸易赤字继续增加 — — 这可不是美国一贯欣赏的宏观经济学的基本准则。	Further compression of an already-weak domestic saving position spells growing current-account and trade deficits – a fundamental axiom of macroeconomics that the US never seems to appreciate.
在今年秋天斯坦福大学的两位计算机科学教授将自己的课程放上网络；而选修该课程的学生竟有5.8万人之多。	At Stanford University this fall, two computer-science professors put their courses online for students anywhere in the world; now they have an enrollment of 58,000.
上述观点认为增强灵活性将使法国企业能更有效地适应市场环境变化，从而增强其活力和竞争力，进而对法国经济起到推动作用。	Greater flexibility, according to this view, will enable French firms to adjust more efficiently to changing market conditions, which in turn will make them more competitive and dynamic, giving the French economy a boost.
但邀请他的明德学院学生也有必要向他们的良知，他们的神，以及其他所有人去解释为何他们觉得穆雷的理念还值得考量。	But the Middlebury students who invited him also owe it to their consciences, their God, and the rest of us to explain in good faith why they think his ideas are still worthy of consideration.
低碳补助开始可能很高但随时间推移逐步下降，因为在二氧化碳排放税增加的同时，新能源技术成本会随着经验和创新而不断下降。	These subsidies could start fairly high and decline gradually over time, as the tax on CO2 emissions rises and the costs of new energy technologies fall with more experience and innovation.
9/11袭击后所产生的对恐怖主义暴力的恐惧对美国的自由所造成的伤害比9/11自杀式袭击所导致的几千条美国人民的生命更大。	Fear of terrorist violence after the 9/11 attacks did more damage to freedom in the United States than the suicidal murder of thousands of its citizens.
当海湾国家领导人商讨投入数十亿美元重建智慧之家时，原本的智慧之家是否不过是某位哈里发从父辈那里继承的一间小图书馆在他们看来并不重要。	When Gulf state leaders talk about their multi-billion-dollar visions of creating a new House of Wisdom, they are not concerned about whether the original was just a modest library that a caliph inherited from his father.
当一场拯救和生存之战转变为征服、占领和吞并之战时，国际社会强烈反弹，以色列也转主动为被动，并在此后一直处于被动。	When a war of salvation and survival turned into a war of conquest, occupation, and annexation, the international community recoiled and Israel went on the defensive. It has remained there ever since.
当然，美国也需要对任何三边东北亚自贸协议的实现做出回应，以维护自身在全球贸易 — — 以及主宰亚洲经济的供应链中的角色。	The US would, of course, need to respond to the conclusion of any trilateral Northeast Asian FTA in order to preserve its own role in global trade – and in the supply chains that dominate the Asian economies.
据世界银行估计，中国在上世纪80年代初有约5亿人口极度贫困，日均收入只有1美元，但在2000年这个人数已经减少到九千万。	The World Bank estimates that dire poverty in China, calculated as individual income of $1 per day, has been reduced from about 500 million people at the start of the 1980’s to less than 90 million in 2000.
不过这个研究可是花了20位科学家10年时间才宣告完成，总费用估计高达4000万美元，因此很显然只有商业投资者才是最主要的资金来源。	But the work has taken 20 scientists a decade to complete, at an estimated cost of $40 million, and commercial investors are an obvious source for such funds.
如果这一趋势持续几年，欧元崩溃或许能够不引发灾难，但仍会让债权国拥有大量债务国债权，而债务国偿还起来困难重重。	If this continued for a few years, a euro breakup would become possible without a meltdown, but it would leave the creditor countries with large claims against debtor countries, which would be difficult to collect.
特别要指出的是，现在可不是忽视拉丁美洲和加勒比地区的时候，因为这些地区有着广泛的投资需求 — — 在最近于阿根廷召开G20会议期间已经有所展现 — — 并且还提供了广泛的增长机会。	In particular, now is not the time to ignore Latin America and the Caribbean, which have a wide range of investment needs – touched upon during the recent G20 meetings in Argentina – and also offer a broad range of growth opportunities.
或者，EMDC可以转而投靠新的保护人 — — 中国 — — 寻求支持和帮助它们抵挡超过它们控制范围的全球市场波动。	Alternatively, EMDCs might turn to powerful new patrons – namely China – to support and shield them from global market swings that are beyond their control.
《怨恨政治学 》 （ The Politics ofResentment）一书的作者凯瑟琳·克莱默（Katherine Cramer）在威斯康辛州获得了关于这一结果的一些洞见。	Katherine Cramer, author of The Politics of Resentment, gained some insight into this outcome in Wisconsin, where, like Trump, the state’s governor, Scott Walker, has been popular among working-class voters.
由于老年人相对劳动年龄人口的数量越来越多，因此对劳动人口造成的压力也越大越大，偿还政府债务、资助公共服务及养老体系所需的税收收入不断萎缩。	As the elderly increasingly outnumber working-age people, pressure is building on the labor force, and tax revenues, needed to service government debt and fund public services and pension systems, are diminishing.
在此过程中，需要考虑到地方因素，如人口趋势、自然资源，包括国内日益增长的中等收入游客对美好自然景区的旅游需求等。	In the process, China will need to take into account local factors, such as population trends, natural resources, and regions’ appeal to middle-income domestic tourists.
2009年春季的官方预测既没有预见一场缓慢复苏的到来，也不知道原本局限在美英两国的危机竟然会迅速在欧元区引爆。	Official forecasts in the spring of 2009 anticipated neither a slow recovery nor that the initial crisis, which was essentially confined to the United States and the United Kingdom, would soon fuel a knock-on crisis in the eurozone.
而政府手中资源的大幅度缩减可能最终将政府推上改革之路，但这也可能导致更可怕的蜕变 — — 一连串更强力的政治高压，经济国有化和孤立主义政策。	A dramatic curtailment of state resources may eventually push the government toward modernization, but it might also produce an uglier shift— toward harder political crackdown, economic nationalism and an essentially isolationist course.
但是，正如欧元区深陷麻烦的经济体货币高估，德国面临着货币低估，这会造成外部盈余，根据定义，这必然导致储蓄超过投资。	But, just as the eurozone’s struggling economies have an overvalued currency, Germany has an undervalued one, which tends to produce external surpluses and, by definition, an excess of savings over investment.
一项计划 — — 2017年经合组织发起的走向数字化工程 — — 正在帮助各国抓住机会，为技术破坏做好准备。	One effort – the Going Digital project, launched by the OECD in 2017 – is helping countries seize opportunities and prepare for technological disruption.
当时，似乎每个人都真切地感受到被创造出来的短暂财富 — — 真到他们去花钱，真到伤及背负偿还这些财富的人受到伤害。	The stores of transitory wealth that were created seemed real enough to everyone at the time – real enough to spend, and real enough to hurt those who were obliged to pay them back.
新任财政部长阿让·杰特里（Arun Jaitley）政治经验丰富，在前任人民党政府中担任过部长职位。	The new finance minister, Arun Jaitley, is an experienced political leader who served in ministerial positions in previous BJP governments.
中国经济专家说，服务部门产出增速足以抵消工业产出增长只有5%甚至以下带来的影响，从而维持当前7%左右的总体经济增长率。	Chinese economic experts say that the output of the service sector is growing fast enough to offset growth in industrial output of 5% or even less, thereby achieving the current overall growth rate of about 7%.
确实，国际货币基金组织和美国的官员们都承认格鲁吉亚在实行健全的宏观经济政策和改革以改善商业环境方面，取得了无可置疑的成功。	To be sure, the International Monetary Fund and United States officials have recognized Georgia’s unquestionable success in adopting sound macroeconomic policies and reforms to improve the business climate.
如今，他们占据了克里米亚人口的12—20 % （ 取决于不同的统计 ） ； 但是，在普京针对其他穆斯林的高压政策的威胁下，他们重新提出全体鞑靼人回家的口号。	Today, they compose 12-20% of the Crimean population (depending on who is counting); but, threatened by Putin’s repressive policies toward other Muslims, they might well renew their call for all Tatars to return.
“在1980~2000年间美国净增了近4000万个就业岗位 ， ” 他指出 ， “ 而你知道自那以后发生了什么吗：更低的税率以及更低的就业职位增长 。 ”	“A net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000,” he noted. “You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.”
他推断，事实是，这些令生存更为艰难的特征向未来的配偶表明，能够合理地处理这些阻碍性特征的个体会拥有极好的遗传结构，因而可能产生强壮的后代。	The very fact, he reasoned, that these features make life harder signals to prospective partners that individuals who can do reasonably well with them have an especially good genetic set-up and are thus likely to produce strong offspring.
如今，欧洲央行拥有类似于美联储、日本银行和英格兰银行那样的政府债务货币化权力，可以保护欧元区免受金融传染影响。	With powers to monetize government debts similar to those exercised by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England, the ECB can now guarantee the eurozone against financial contagion.
）本月早些时候，以色列驻莫斯科大使在以色列议会外交事务和防务委员会的讲话中赞扬了双边关系“以前所未见的方式蓬勃发展 。 ”	Earlier this month, speaking before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Israel’s ambassador to Moscow praised the “flourishing in an unprecedented manner” of the bilateral relationship.
但即便在2003年玫瑰革命后开始逐渐淡出公众视线，当他被过去的门生米哈伊尔·萨卡什维利驱逐时，他的狡猾和政治手腕依然使他成功地将过去的经历转化为优势。	Yet, even if he was largely forgotten after the Rose Revolution of 2003, when he was ousted by his one-time protégé, Mikheil Saakashvili, his cunning and skill at manipulating political forces still enabled him to manage his legacy to his advantage.
今年六月，国际货币基金组织的执行委员会采取了这一步骤。 委员会打成一致意见更新监控，使得它更为具有针对性和有效。	This June, the IMF’s Executive Board did just that, reaching a broad consensus on updating surveillance to make it more focused and effective.
假如印度的穷人能够享有充分的初级教育或者，就此而言，美国贫穷的城市黑人能够享有的话，就没有必要在高等教育和其它领域设置保留地。	Were adequate primary education available to India’s poor – or, for that matter, to America’s poor urban blacks – there would be no need for reserved places in higher education and elsewhere.
但是，经济学家不应该将此指责为全球政策协调的大失败，而应该接受失衡是世界的常态并试图遏制由此带来的扭曲。	But, far from decrying this as a major failure of global policy coordination, economists should accept imbalances as the natural state of the world and try to manage the resulting distortions.
但是，不管普京到底会怎么做，他的个人影响力以及他带领俄罗斯所走的战略方向在以后多年都将占据主导地位。	But, regardless of what Putin does, his personal influence and the strategic direction in which he has taken Russia will remain dominant for years to come.
但是你对他的处境表示同情。 如果你不是用最好的论据来确立你的理论、排挤你的论敌这样他们就没有神学和科学上的理由来进行攻击，你也会一样遭到当众嘲弄。	But you empathize with his position: you will be pilloried in the same way if you don’t nail down your theory with the best arguments possible and marginalize your opponents so that they have neither theological nor scientific reasons to attack you.
而如果说在过去40年中西方女性究竟学到了点什么，那就是如何对现状感到不满 — — 这也是我们在输出西方女权主义价值观时，其他国家的人们必须明白的，非常重要的一点。	If Western women have learned anything in the past 40 years, it is how to be unsatisfied with the status quo – an important insight for the rest of the world, as we seek to export Western-style feminism.
超级富豪已经获得了一轮又一轮的减税和特别税收优惠，他们能够轻松得到央行贷款，并在推高利润的同时获得非技术工人薪酬降低带来的巨大好处。	The super-rich have received round after round of tax cuts and special tax breaks, easy credits from central banks, and exceptional gains from technologies that are boosting profits while lowering unskilled workers’ wages.
自1990年代末以来，在美联储超级调和政策的协助和怂恿下，美国这种依赖资产的经济形式与那个由泡沫估值下的抵押品承保的、同样有害的杠杆周期之间的相互作用就从未消停过。	Aided and abetted by the Federal Reserve’s über-accommodation since the late 1990s, there was no stopping the interplay between America’s asset-dependent economy and an equally pernicious leverage cycle underwritten by bubble-inflated collateral.
军事资源不过是所有工具中的一种，而且一般来讲，它们的部署和利用有着明确的限制，不但在时间上有很高的要求，而且必须与民间行动协调一致。	Military resources are only one tool among many others, and, generally speaking, their deployment is clearly defined, limited in time, and coordinated with civilian action.
伦敦—一个广泛承认的共识是，2008—2009年的危机肇因在于过度的银行借贷行为，而之所以在危机之后不能完全复苏，也是因为银行由于“损坏的”资产负债表拒绝借贷。	LONDON – It is generally agreed that the crisis of 2008-2009 was caused by excessive bank lending, and that the failure to recover adequately from it stems from banks’ refusal to lend, owing to their “broken” balance sheets.
但正如2016年10月经合组织的一份研究报告所指出的那样，这一事件引发了对“用于定义GDP以充分反映经济现实的概念性会计框架的能力”的严重质疑。	As an October 2016 OECD working paper noted, the episode raised serious questions about the “ability of the conceptual accounting framework used to define GDP to adequately reflect economic reality.”
议会还为印度储备银行（RBI）成立了一个货币政策委员会，该委员会将确保政策考虑多重观点并改善持续性。	And parliament has created a monetary-policy committee for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which should ensure that multiple views are embedded in policy and improve continuity.
还有19个国家（或国家地区 ） — —其中多数来自欧洲和南北美 — — 制定了允许同性恋伴侣结婚的法律。	Nineteen other countries (or regions of countries) – mostly in Europe and North and South America – now allow gay couples to marry legally.
十年前，时任美国国防部长的唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德（Donald Rumsfeld）根据对美国以及伊拉克战争的态度下了一个将欧洲分为“新 ” “ 旧”两块的著名论断。	Ten years ago, then-US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld famously distinguished between “Old” and “New” Europe on the basis of their attitudes toward the United States and the war in Iraq.
但是这些天达沃斯上空耀眼的阳光并不能掩盖笼罩全球的金融危机所带来的阴影，从而使今年的会议充塞了沮丧和灾难的气氛。	But the superb sunshine in Davos these days cannot avoid the shadows of the financial crisis that have enveloped the world, casting an atmosphere of gloom and doom on this year’s meeting.
相对政府债券，这类债券提供较小的溢价，有望吸引退休基金等长期投资者，否则这类投资者将面临零甚至负实际回报。	Offering a small premium on government securities, such bonds would likely attract long-term investors like pension funds, which otherwise face zero or even negative real returns.
安抚这些担忧需要明确我们不是要以牺牲某些人为代价来抬高另一些人；性别平等必须达到双赢、而非零和的效果。	Addressing such concerns will require us to show that we are not promoting some people at the expense of others; gender parity must be win-win, not zero-sum.
其中一些是由非国家行为人犯下的，一些是国家行为人犯下的；但所有这些都是在以宗教信仰不同为表现的分歧和冲突的环境中犯下的。	Some of it is committed by non-state actors, and some of it by state actors; but all of it is committed in the context of division and conflict defined by differences of religious faith.
随着奥巴马的当选，美国已经在全球化和多极化的世界框架中面对未来；而另一方面，欧洲却在当今的危机中重新挖掘其采取国家行动的效果，因此还在吃老本。	With the election of Obama, America has turned toward the future within a globalized, multipolar world; Europe, on the other hand, is rediscovering national action in this time of crisis, and thus banking on the past!
西雅图—过去十五年来，世界最穷人群的生活的改善比以往任何时候都要快，但我乐观地认为，未来十五年会变得更好。	SEATTLE – The lives of the world’s poorest people have improved more rapidly in the last 15 years than ever before, yet I am optimistic that we will do even better in the next 15 years.
除了让朝鲜获得技术、学习市场经济商业实践外，开城工业园区每年还为工人发放大约8000万美元薪酬（160美元的月薪水平远远超过朝鲜国内薪资水平 ） 。	Aside from enabling the North to acquire technology and learn market-oriented business practices, the Kaesong complex generates about $80 million annually in workers’ compensation (the monthly wage of $160 is far higher than in North Korea).
在欧洲十国（包括像英国、波兰和匈牙利等所谓欧洲怀疑论的堡垒）所进行的皮尤研究中心调查发现，74%的受调查者支持欧盟在海外采取更加果断的行动。	A Pew Research Center study in ten European countries (including supposed bastions of Euroskepticism like the UK, Poland, and Hungary) found that an average of 74% of those polled supported more decisive action by the EU abroad.
但UNRWA预算的绝大部分用于教育儿童和青年，其中有一半人居住在黎巴嫩、叙利亚和约旦，其他人居住在加沙和约旦河西岸。	But the majority of UNRWA’s budget goes towards educating children and young people, half of them in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, and the rest in Gaza and the West Bank.
虽然这种做法似乎离总统有些距离，但至少在一个能迅速随意玩弄事实的营销大师操纵下，这种方法能够发挥不错的效果。	While the approach may not seem very presidential, it works, at least when carried out by a master marketer who plays fast and loose with the facts.
欧洲央行很明白疲软的银行所带来的风险；但是，欧元区经济严重依赖银行信用，因此不能直截了当地解决这一问题。	The European Central Bank is well aware of the risk from weaker banks; but, with the eurozone economy heavily reliant on bank credit, addressing it is not straightforward.
当今美国就像魏玛共和国，仇恨者和恐惧者对主流政治和经济机构毫无信任可言，因此追随承诺最大程度破坏的领导人。	In the US today, as in the Weimar Republic, the resentful and the fearful have so little trust in prevailing political and economic institutions that they follow a leader who promises maximum disruption.
对他们，也对特朗普而言，奥巴马是罪魁：他没有抵挡住外交领导人（内塔尼亚胡可能会反对这一点 ） ； 他过早从伊拉克撤军（尽管撤军时间表是他的共和党前任制定的 ） ； 他甚至为美国而“道歉 ” 。	For them, and for Trump, Obama is to blame: he doesn’t stand up to foreign leaders (Binyamin Netanyahu might disagree); he withdrew from Iraq too soon (though the timetable was set by his Republican predecessor); he even “apologizes” for America.
那么，委内瑞拉是如何让GDP萎缩幅度超过大萧条、西班牙内战（GDP下降29 % ） 甚至最近的希腊危机（经济萎缩了26.9 % ） 的呢？	How is it, then, that Venezuela can have a GDP contraction that dwarfs that of the Great Depression, the Spanish Civil War (when GDP fell by 29%), or even the recent Greek crisis (when the economy shrank by 26.9%)?
当探险家约翰·卡博特500年前驶离纽芬兰海岸的时候，大群的鳕鱼减缓了船只行驶的速度；船员们可以从船边放下水桶，拎起满满一桶鳕鱼。	When the explorer John Cabot sailed off the coast of Newfoundland more than 500 years ago, vast shoals of cod slowed down his ships; crews could lower buckets over the side and fill them with fish.
在为北京奥运会设计总体规划时，小斯佩尔这位享有盛名的建筑师和城市规划师而像他的父亲一样试图创造一个未来国际大都市。	While designing the master plan for the Beijing Games, Speer Jr., an acclaimed architect and town planner, also sought, like his father, to create a futuristic global metropolis.
如果特朗普背弃这些原则 — — 并且，如果在随之而来的沮丧情绪中坚持这些原则变成了多愁善感的浪漫之举 — — 他赢得选举的解释失败的代价将极其高昂。	If Trump refutes those principles – and if, in the despondency that follows, invoking them comes to be seen as a sentimental, romantic act – the price of the failures of representation that led to his election will be high indeed.
1996年，对于一类名为蛋白酶抑制剂的首批药物的批准带来一种多药、抗HIV疗程，即高效抗逆转录病毒治疗（HAART）的被采用。	In 1996, the approval of the first drug of a class called protease inhibitors led to the adoption of a multi-drug, anti-HIV regimen known as highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART.
现在，有关于重建全球金融体系，提升可持续性和为发展中国家提供“贸易援助”的“布雷顿森林体系II”的广泛议论。	There is now widespread talk of a “Bretton Woods II” that would restructure global finance, promote sustainability, and offer developing countries “aid for trade.”
不然的话，不但欧洲的全球政治野心化为泡影，连大西洋那边的盟友也最终将对欧洲人拒绝承担安全责任的行为失去耐性。	Otherwise, not only will Europe’s global political ambitions become untenable, but its allies on the other side of the Atlantic will lose patience with Europeans’ refusal to shoulder their share of the security burden.
一些欧盟成员国 - - 特别是中欧和东欧的新成员 - - 已经开始使用私有化收入为养老金改革提供资金。	Some EU countries - particularly new members in Central and Eastern Europe - have committed themselves to use privatization receipts to finance pension reform.
2002年，中国和东盟达成了不具有法律约束力的冲突管理准则，但作为大国，中国认为与小国进行双边而非多边谈判能够获取更多利益。	In 2002, China and ASEAN agreed on a legally non-binding code of conduct for managing such disputes, but, as a large power, China believes that it will gain more in bilateral rather than multilateral negotiations with small countries.
他们利用了民众的感情，很多民众认为在鼓吹全球化收益的同时坐视不平等上升到前所未有水平的政治阶层抛弃了他们。	They exploited the feeling of many citizens that the political classes – which touted the benefits of globalization, while allowing inequality to rise to unprecedented levels – had abandoned them.
印度和东亚取得了成功，他们不仅在初级教育上，也在中等教育和高等教育，尤其是在技术和科学方面大力投资。	Among the success stories were India and East Asia, which invested heavily not just in primary education, but also in secondary and tertiary education, and especially in technology and science.
比如，2015年上半年，只有四分之一的申请者来自叙利亚和伊拉克，很大一部分人已经在这些国家内部或周边找到了收容所。	In the first half of 2015, for instance, only about one-quarter of applicants came from Syria and Iraq, a significant proportion of whom had already found shelter in the UN camps in or around those countries.
风险回归选择给投资者/储蓄者（包括退休基金）带来的好处将超过债务成本；事实上，可贸易部门的重要次级增长引擎并不依赖于低成本债务。	The beneficial effect on the risk-return options available to investors/savers (including pension funds) will outweigh the higher cost of debt; indeed, an important subset of growth engines in the tradable sector is not dependent on low-cost debt.
反过来，这应该也会恢复公司的“动物精神 ” ， 从而增加对新工厂和设备的投资，随之而来的则是更高的工资和薪金。	This, in turn, should revive corporate “animal spirits,” leading to higher investment in new plants and equipment, together with higher wages and salaries.
如果政府一贯宣称其愿意扭曲法律(有时违反法律)来应付前所未有的威胁，那么，它就会因为它的顽固而非灵活而臭名昭著。	An administration that has consistently boasted of its willingness to bend (and sometimes break) the law to meet an unprecedented threat has become notorious not for its flexibility, but for its rigidity.
受历史使命或面对主宰势力主张群体身份的不可妥协的要求驱动的国家运动通常不会屈从于经济考虑或最后时刻的经济诱惑。	National movements driven by a historical mission or an uncompromising quest to assert group identity against a dominant power normally do not succumb to economic considerations and last-minute economic bait.
胡佛在其1947年3月18日的第三份报告中认为，德国可以降级为牧业国家的概念是一个“幻觉 ” ， 除非让25,000,000德国人灭绝或迁出德国，否则绝不可能实现。	Hoover’s third report of March 18, 1947, called the notion that Germany could be reduced to a pastoral state an “illusion,” which could not be achieved without exterminating or moving 25,000,000 people out of the country.
毕竟，基地组织尽管有所削弱，仍然有能力重新打入阿富汗，而塔利班仍控制着阿富汗的东部和南部以及相邻的巴基斯坦北瓦济里斯坦。	After all, Al Qaeda, albeit weakened, remains capable of regenerating inside Afghanistan, where the Taliban remain dominant in the country’s east and south, as well as in neighboring North Waziristan in Pakistan.
但在一个日趋复杂的世界，致力于实现目标的精英执政专家很有可能比现在厌恶事实的分裂的民粹主义者带来好得多的结果。	But, in an increasingly complex world, meritocratic and utilitarian technocracy is likely to produce far better outcomes than today’s divisive and fact-averse populism.
和平外交才取得了成果。 它使卡扎菲认识到重新开启与西方的外交关系并放弃利比亚的核野心，对他本人和国家的未来都是有利的。	Peaceful diplomacy did the job, showing Qadaffi that reopening diplomatic relations with the West and abandoning Libya’s nuclear ambitions would be advantageous for its own future and that of the country.
最后，一旦危机爆发，引致金融市场对风险进行重估，避免经济和金融危机的紧迫性会迫使政府支撑总体需求并挽救私人债务。	Finally, once the crisis hit, leading to a re-pricing of risks in financial markets, the need to avoid an economic and financial meltdown compelled governments to support aggregate demand and make private liabilities whole.
去年4月，阿联酋亿万富豪阿卜杜拉·阿齐兹·古赖尔（Abdul Aziz al-Ghurair）成立了阿拉伯世界最大的教育基金，为该地区无法获得充分教育的年轻人提供14亿美元资金。	Last April, Abdul Aziz al-Ghurair, a billionaire businessman from the United Arab Emirates, launched the Arab world’s largest education fund, allocating $1.14 billion in grants for underserved youth from the region.
但是，尽管这一方法必然有助于抓获伪劣产品，但合法企业生产的劣质或减料产品会成为漏网之鱼，消费者只有在使用后才能知道产品质量低下，通常这意味着极高的健康风险。	But, while this approach would certainly help to catch counterfeits, it would miss the substandard or degraded products made by legitimate firms, which are tested only by the consumer – and often at great cost in terms of health risks.
平均而言，美国比瑞典更富，但美国最富和最穷之间的收入差远大于瑞典，且美国对待穷人的态度是惩罚，而不是支持。	The US is richer on average than Sweden, but the income gap between America’s richest and poorest is vastly wider than it is in Sweden, and the US treats its poor punitively, rather than supportively.
当然，经济制裁和政治孤立深深地伤害了伊朗政权，首当其冲的是革命卫队，他们的领导人和所属产业已经成为国际社会的打击对象。	Economic sanctions and political isolation have, of course, deeply hurt the regime, especially the Revolutionary Guards, whose leaders and industries have been directly targeted by the international community.
去年11月，当共和党在美国国会选举中大获全胜时，人们一致认为原因在于选民们对令人失望的经济表现感到不满。	When the Republican Party scored strong gains in last November’s US congressional elections, the universally accepted explanation was that voters were expressing their frustration with disappointing economic performance.
虽然旅游业可能在一段时间内奄奄一息，但特别是相比东乌克兰族人，俄国人的补贴会让克里米亚人的日子相对好过。	Though the tourism industry is likely to be moribund for some time, Russian subsidies may leave Crimeans relatively better off, especially from the perspective of their ethnic kin in eastern Ukraine.
这样做就像是 一只蚂蚁试图了解我们人类的决定一样，因为我们的智力和上帝无限的智慧相比是如此的微不足道。	It is as if an ant should try to understand our decisions, so puny is our intelligence in comparison with the infinite wisdom of God.
这些原因包括人类大脑所进化出来的习惯、童年的体验和不幸遭遇、历史互动（historical interactions）和下意识地用于解读信息和框定问题的启发式捷径。	These include the manner by which our brains have evolved, childhood exposures and experiences, historical interactions, and heuristic shortcuts that we unconsciously use to interpret information and frame issues.
整个地区的各个政府获得了来自伊斯兰开发银行（Islamic Development Bank）的1亿多美元融资用于推广千年村计划概念本身。	Governments across the region have taken over $100 million in financing from the Islamic Development Bank to scale up the MVP concepts themselves.
这一思想出现于20世纪20年代，其主要鼓吹者是意大利人杜黑（Guilio Douhet ） 、 美国人米歇尔（William Mitchell）和英国人特伦查德（Hugh Trenchard ） 。	The main advocates of the idea, developed in the 1920s, were the Italian Giulio Douhet, the American William Mitchell, and the Englishman Hugh Trenchard.
以色列人将会把这一问题归结于政治环境的作用；他们会指出，伊朗不但在身为核不扩散条约成员国期间发展其核能力，而且还将摧毁以色列作为其优先任务。	Political contexts matter, the Israelis will argue. Not only has Iran developed its nuclear capabilities while a party to the NPT, the Israelis will say, but it also has put Israel’s destruction high on its agenda.
如果像20世纪90年代的日本或者1937年的美国那样，认为巨额赤字是个严重的威胁，从而过早且过大幅度地增加税收削减开支，那么其经济就可能重新滑入衰退。	If, like Japan in the late 1990’s and the US in 1937, they take the threat of large deficits seriously and raise taxes and cut spending too much too soon, their economies could fall back into recession.
首先，它们强调短期的控制和监控，而没有将这种疾病和决定健康的社会和结构性因素联系起来，包括自来水、卫生设施和全民医疗等公共基础设施。	For starters, they emphasize short-term-vector control and surveillance, while delinking the disease from the social and structural determinants of health, including public infrastructure such as running water, proper sanitation, and access to care.
此外，奥巴马不应该将美印双边关系的眼光局限在纯粹的交易层面，而应该寻求加强印度作为美国长期生产伙伴的能力。	Moreover, Obama should resist the urge to approach the bilateral relationship purely in transactional terms, but instead should seek to strengthen India’s long-term capacity to be a productive partner with the US.
在艰难的市场中，兼并 — — 它让银行削减成本、共享信息技术平台、增加市场力量，从而缓解利润率压力、重建资本 — — 很有意义。	In a difficult market, mergers – by enabling banks to cut costs, share information-technology platforms, and increase market power, thereby relieving pressure on margins and rebuilding capital – make sense.
对塔吉克斯坦总统拉赫蒙来说，这肯定比求助于国际货币基金组织（IMF）更好，后者会要求他进行重大改革。	For Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, that certainly beats seeking help from the International Monetary Fund, which would demand substantial reforms.
发自剑桥 — — 中国政府的不透明本质使外界难以摸清中国经济政策的走向，从而也很难揣摩中国经济在未来几年将如何发展。	CAMBRIDGE – The opaque nature of China’s government makes it difficult to see where Chinese economic policy is heading, and thus how the Chinese economy will develop in the years ahead.
通过这种谈判，发达经济体对制成品的平均关税从1940年代后期的40％以上降至如今的4％左右 — — 所有成员国都因此获利。	Through such negotiations, the average tariff on manufactured goods among advanced economies has been reduced from over 40% in the late 1940s to around 4% today – much to the benefit of all members.
例如巴西的GDP增长已大幅放缓，从2010年的7.5%下降到2011年的2.7 % ， 甚至是2012年的0.9 % ， 同期印度的经济增长率也从10.5%下降到了3.2 % 。	For example, GDP growth in Brazil has slowed sharply, from 7.5% in 2010 to 2.7% in 2011 and to just 0.9% in 2012, while India’s growth rate slowed from 10.5% to 3.2% over the same period.
同样来自芝加哥大学的金融学教授路易吉·津加莱斯（Luigi Zingales）指责同侪过度强调金融产品的好处，导致了社会动荡。	And finance professor Luigi Zingales, also at the University of Chicago, has charged that his fellow finance specialists have led society astray by overstating the benefits produced by the financial industry.
联合国成立于1945年，它是战胜的同盟国领导人的共同愿景 — — 确保二十世纪下半叶不会重蹈上半叶的覆辙。	The UN began, in 1945, as a vision shared by the leaders of the victorious Allies, who were determined to ensure that the second half of the twentieth century did not play out like the first half.
如伊朗神学家莫森·卡迪瓦尔（Mohsen Kadivar）所强调，问题在于伊斯兰教法的诸多内容联系的是前现代社会结构，它们否认女性和非穆斯林获得与穆斯林男性一样的保护。	The problem, as emphasized by the Iranian theologian Mohsen Kadivar, is that many parts of sharia law are linked to pre-modern social structures, which deny women or non-Muslims the same protections as Muslim men receive.
这将给经常项目和贸易赤字造成新的压力，使扭转就业和收入损失 — — 政客马上就会将它归咎于美国的贸易伙伴 — — 变得极其困难。	That would put renewed pressure on the current-account and trade deficits, making it extremely difficult to reverse the loss of jobs and income that politicians are quick to blame on America’s trading partners.
但可以肯定，普京发动乌克兰战争所释放的暴力已经夺走了数百条无辜的生命，并把世界进一步推向灾难的深渊。	What is certain, however, is that the violence unleashed by Putin’s war on Ukraine has claimed hundreds of innocent lives and brought the world a step closer to disaster.
如此声明表明美国并不理解其在朝鲜问题上不具有可信的军事选择，因为任何美国打击都将立刻导致韩国人口中心城市遭到毁灭。	Such claims reflect a lack of understanding that, when it comes to North Korea, the US has no credible military option, because any US attack would result in the immediate devastation of South Korea’s main population centers.
自1990年代中期以来 ， “ 其他地区”经常账目下的净存款余额有了巨额攀升。 按联邦储备银行的一位经济学家估算，为每年4500亿美金。	Since the mid-1990’s, the net current-account surplus of “all the rest” has risen by an amount that one Federal Reserve Bank economist has put at $450 billion a year, not because savings rates have increased, but because investment rates have fallen.
更加糟糕的是，沃尔福威茨对世界银行看起来并没有宏大的设想，只是扩大了他的前任沃尔福森开创的反腐败议程，而没有发展战略。	Worse, Wolfowitz did not seem to have a grand vision for the Bank. Instead of a development strategy, there was simply an expansion of the anti-corruption agenda initiated by his predecessor, James Wolfensohn.
这种情绪还常常四处传播，不时占据公众对于石油需求剧增，能源价格飙升以及由此而来的地缘政治不稳定的想象。	Such sentiments often spread and capture the public imagination at times of rapidly rising oil demand, sharp spikes in energy prices, and geo-political uncertainty.
基因测试这个议题能在德国获得了如此关注，这毫不奇怪，因为这是一个强令自己一定不能重犯纳粹时期“筛选优良人种”罪行的国家。	It is not surprising that questions about genetic tests should receive special attention in Germany, given the national imperative of avoiding any repetition of the crimes of the Nazi era.
类似地，作为候选人的特朗普抱怨北约的欧洲成员国没有兑现它们将GDP的2%用于防务支出的承诺，并说要降低美国在欧洲的军事支出。	Likewise, candidate Trump, complaining that NATO’s European members had not met their commitments to spend 2% of GDP on defense, vowed to reduce US military spending in Europe.
美国看待叙利亚的角度大体是站在伊朗问题的基础上，它之所以寻求推翻巴沙尔，是为了除掉伊朗领导人在中东的一个重要盟友，一个与以色列接壤的盟友。	The US views Syria mainly through the lens of Iran, seeking to depose Assad in order to deprive Iran’s leaders of an important ally in the region, one that borders Israel.
阿根廷外汇已基本耗尽，必须采取紧缩措施来确保国际货币基金组织（IMF）的500亿美元救助 — — 即便如此也没能安抚投资者。	Nearly out of foreign exchange, Argentina had to adopt austerity measures to secure a $50 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund – and not even that has calmed investors.
随着该币种在2017年出现了让人两眼发直的飙升（从约1000美元涨到12月12日的1.6万美元以上 ) ， 就算是少量配置了比特币也会令投资组合回报产生巨大差异。	With its price having surged by an eye-popping amount this year (from around $1,000 to over $16,000 as of December 12), even a small allocation of Bitcoin has made a material difference in investors’ portfolios.
例如，许多经济顾问仍然认为气候变化方案阻碍而非促进增长 — — 尽管事实是低碳方案创造了新的投资和就业机会。	For example, many economic advisers still consider climate-change solutions to be anti-growth rather than pro-growth – despite the fact that low-carbon solutions create new investment opportunities and jobs.
第三是从一开始就制定好的退出战略，这也是卡尔德隆所欠缺的，因为他是在自己本国的领土上，如果战败了当然无路可走，即使是打赢了也当然只能留在国内。	The third condition was an exit strategy at the outset, which Calderón lacks, because he can neither withdraw in defeat in his own country, nor withdraw and declare victory.
中国伟大的“开放”政策和1991年苏联的崩溃标志着一场持续1/4个世纪的真正意义重大的全球性进步拉开了序幕。	China’s great “opening up” and the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991 marked the start of a quarter-century of truly remarkable global progress.
委内瑞拉当前的灾难则是又一次提醒：这个理应富庶的国家正在遭遇全世界最深刻的衰退、最高的通胀和最糟糕的社会指标恶化。	Venezuela’s current catastrophe is another: A country that should be rich is suffering the world’s deepest recession, highest inflation, and worst deterioration of social indicators.
美国强硬派有着自身长长的仇恨清单，首先就是1979年包围美国驻德黑兰大使馆事件。 在该事件中，66名美国外交官和公民被劫持444天。	The US hardliners have their own long list of grievances, starting with the 1979 seizure of America’s embassy in Tehran, in which 66 US diplomats and citizens were held for 444 days.
我回应道 ， “ 我以为高油价和高铁矿石价格已经使巴西繁荣起来了 … . . 巴西为什么不在其基础设施建设上花更多的钱呢 ？ ”	I responded, “I thought the high oil and iron ore prices had made Brazil boom….Why hasn’t Brazil spent more on its infrastructure?”
赫尔辛基 — — 领导企业最终丧失领导地位似乎是科技行业的法则 — — 而且其过程往往迅速而又残酷。	HELSINKI – It seems to be a law in the technology industry that leading companies eventually lose their positions – often quickly and brutally.
而中国可能也感到满意的是，在尔虞我诈的西藏政治中，中方所指派的噶玛巴竟然奇怪地得到了达赖喇嘛的支持。	China would also have drawn comfort from the fact that, within the murky world of intra-Tibetan politics, its anointed Karmapa, oddly, had the Dalai Lama’s backing.
上述措施和类似的努力能够避免饥荒，提供安全食品、消除流行病、确保人民健康、给普通人带来收入，消灭极端贫困，最重要的是，为人们驱除绝望，带来希望的曙光。	These and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security, epidemic disease and health, income and utter poverty, and, most importantly, hope and despair.
但是穆沙拉夫掌权是圣战者的保护人，其军队为这些圣战者提供资助和装备，并且训练他们以便入侵印度领土。 印度几乎没人认为与这样一个狡诈的人可以实现真正的和平。	But Musharraf had come to power as the patron of the jihadi s his army was financing, equipping, and training for their forays into Indian territory, and few in New Delhi thought genuine peace could be made with such a duplicitous man.
至于韩国，如能做好充分的准备，制定有效的政策，获得更多的金融资源，就能够管理好和平统一，减小冲击的消极影响。	As for South Korea, with sufficient preparation, effective policies, and more financial resources, it can manage a peaceful reunification and mitigate the adverse effects of the shock.
为了捍卫他们的利益，银行家们一直不断游说反对一些法规 — — 这些法规要求他们较少依赖借款，转向依靠留存收益或者新股基金来资助贷款及投资。	To safeguard their interests, bankers have lobbied relentlessly against regulations that would require them to rely less on borrowing and more on retained earnings or new equity to fund their lending and investments.
另一方面，以前总统哈什米·拉夫桑贾尼为代表的一些有影响的伊朗人承认：如果要重新融入国际社会、正面处理国内的经济危机，那么伊美关系是必不可少的。	On the other hand, some influential Iranians – led by former president Hashemi Rafsanjani – recognize that relations with the US are inevitable, given Iran’s need to re-integrate into the international community and face its economic deficiencies.
如果那些在邻国申请庇护者被送往难民营，在免遭迫害的同时享受来自富裕国家的财政支持，就可以消灭人口走私 — — 和运输途中的人员死亡。	If those who claim asylum in a nearby country were sent to a refugee camp, safe from persecution, and supported financially by aid from affluent countries, people smuggling – and deaths in transit – would be eliminated.
其他拉美国家也效仿。 尽管这一单位的名称听起来技术性很强，但是智利人民看起来已经学会用UF考虑重要的合同，而不是比索。	Despite the unit’s technical-sounding name, people in Chile seem to have learned to think in terms of the UF instead of the peso for important contracts.
疾病预防运动还必须发展出有说服力的叙事，而F — — 界定（frame）问题 — — 是艾滋病界赢得政治领导人支持的关键。	Disease prevention movements must also develop persuasive narratives, and “F” – framing the issue – was essential to the AIDS community’s effort to gain support from political leaders.
自1999年普京当选总理以来，包括采访记者尼古拉·安德鲁申科在内的34名记者已经在该国报导时遇害，安德鲁申科去年在圣彼得堡采访时被殴打致死。	Since 1999, when Putin first became prime minister, 34 journalists have been killed while reporting in the country, including investigative reporter Nikolai Andrushchenko, who was beaten to death last year in St. Petersburg.
由于发达经济体的非常规货币政策还拉低了它们的货币、刺激了它们的出口，竞争性贬值如今已成为你一个实实在在的威胁。	Because advanced economies’ unconventional monetary policies have also depreciated their currencies and stimulated their exports, the risk of competitive devaluations is now a real concern.
此外，负责这一过程的团队还没有选定；与其他任命一样，该团队成员很可能将面临漫长的审查过程，有的还会遭到参议院确认过程的刁难。	Moreover, the team that will oversee that process has yet to be selected; like other appointees, its members could well face long vetting processes and, in some cases, confirmation challenges in the Senate.
他声称，如若当选，将重启财政条约谈判，并寻求改变欧洲央行的地位 — — 这或许是他准备与欧洲正统决裂的先声。	He has indicated that, if elected, he would re-negotiate the fiscal treaty and seek to alter the statutes of the European Central Bank – perhaps as an early sign of willingness to break with European orthodoxy.
自从 1825 年起，除了 1930 年代的大萧条之外，央行对此一般的做法都是如此：将风险性的金融资产保值，防止金融市场的风险波及到实体经济上，关掉风险性的企业，避免冒险性投资。	This response is understandably controversial, because it rewards those who bet on risky assets, many of whom accepted risk with open eyes and bear some responsibility for causing the crisis. But an effective rescue cannot be done any other way.
这是一句暴露其民粹主义本质的话语：存在一种“真正的人民 ” ， 即民粹主义者；只有他忠实地代表这一“人民 ” ； 其他所有人都可以 — — 事实上也应该 — — 被排斥。	This is telltale populist rhetoric: there is a “real people,” as defined by the populist; only he faithfully represents it; and everyone else can – indeed should – be excluded.
即便是在资产价格泡沫频繁出现的时候，大多人依然相信这些泡沫是不可能 — — 甚至不应该 — — 被提早发现并消除的。	Even when the frequent appearance of asset-price bubbles was acknowledged, most believed that efforts to detect and prick them at an early stage would be impossible – and potentially harmful.
如果俄罗斯经济如预料那样保持停滞，退休金税（已高达收入的22 % ） 五年后也必须提高，才能保持退休基金资金源稳定。	If the Russian economy remains stagnant, as expected, the pension tax (already 22% of income) will also have to rise in five years, to keep the fund’s financing levels stable.
任何因为退休金政策规定而要为公民数十年的退休生活支付数十亿退休金的国家都可能走向破产，最好的结果也只能是停滞不前。	Any country required by its public-pension policy to transfer billions of dollars to citizens for decades-long retirement periods risks bankruptcy or, at best, stagnation.
通过把诸如国外援助和制定发展政策等更多的责任转移给欧盟机构，不但巩固了欧盟作为欧洲决策中心日益重要的地位，更有助于欧盟去适应新的国际现状。	Transferring more areas of responsibility, such as foreign aid and development policies, to EU institutions helps the Union to adapt to new international realities by underpinning its growing importance as Europe’s decision-making center.
他们往往��选择能支撑自身权力把控的警句，片面强调服从权威等所谓的“传统”美德，却只字不提儒家思想认为民众有反抗不公平统治者的权利。	They tend to cherry-pick quotations that support their own grip on power, stressing such “traditional” virtues as obedience to authority, neglecting to mention that Confucian thought upholds the right to rebel against unjust rulers.
我衷心期望，当历史学家回顾去年夏天格鲁吉亚对南奥塞梯袭击的时候，被那场战争夺去生命的奥塞梯人、俄罗斯人和格鲁吉亚人不会白白牺牲。	My hope is that, when historians look back at Georgia’s attack on South Ossetia of last summer, the Ossetians, Russians, and Georgians killed in that war will be seen as having not died in vain.
10月，成千上万名不满安置补偿的村民把一名当地官员扣留了数小时之久，最后直到万名武装警察出动才把他解救出来。	In October, tens of thousands of villagers protesting inadequate resettlement compensation held a local official captive for several hours before ten thousand People’s Armed Police officers rescued him.
但危机开始以来，大部分欧盟国家所实施的经济政策让深入一体化遇到了前所未有的挑战 — — 目前已经取得的成就也陷入了危机之中。	But the economic policies that have been implemented in most EU countries since the crisis began have given rise to an unprecedented threat to deeper integration – and, indeed, to what already has been achieved.
如果决策者忽略这样的现实，就有可能鼓励更快、更廉价的教育形式，而上述教育形式对学生和社会的贡献都小得多。	If policymakers overlook them, they run the risk of encouraging quicker, cheaper forms of education that will do far less to serve either students or society.
但他们现在的实际收入甚至比1999年更低，因为当时政府企业和工会达成了一个三方协议将工资增长牢牢控制了起来。	Though their productivity has risen by 17.8% over the past 15 years, they now earn less in real terms than in 1999, when a tripartite agreement among the government, companies, and unions effectively capped wages.
中国最红电影明星范冰冰就是如此，她从去年7月开始消失，同时，她以往非常活跃的新浪微博账户突然不再更新。	That is what happened to Fan Bingbing, China’s biggest movie star, who disappeared last July, when her previously very active account on the Sina Weibo social media platform (China’s answer to Twitter) suddenly went silent.
新的经合组织报告《室外空气污染的经济后果 》 （ The Economic Consequences of Outdoor Air Pollution）估算，到2060年，室外空气污染将造成600—900万起过早死亡，而2010年为300万。	A new OECD report, The Economic Consequences of Outdoor Air Pollution, estimates that outdoor air pollution will cause 6-9 million premature deaths annually by 2060, compared to three million in 2010.
本地新闻之所以重要，是因为大多数美国人的日常生活其实跟那些充满仇恨意味的全国性新闻报道完全不是一回事。	Local news matters because the day-to-day world that most Americans experience is nothing like what rancorous national news coverage makes it out to be.
在1950年的美国大概4%的人从事农业，38%从事工业（包括采矿，建筑和制造 ） ， 58%从事服务业。	In the United States, around 4% of the population in 1950 was employed in agriculture, 38% in industry (including mining, construction, and manufacturing), and 58% in services.
但人口统计学家很少使用总死亡率，而更多地以特定的年龄和性别死亡率来考虑问题，这一般被概括为“寿命 ” 。	But demographers rarely use CDR’s, thinking instead in terms of age- and sex-specific mortality rates, usually summarized as “life expectancy.”
西方各国政府准备与中国人和印度人讨论是否以及何时让新兴经济体承担减排的责任��但是对于世界上最贫穷的人们遭受的更加严重的不公却保持缄默。	Western governments are ready to argue with the Chinese and Indians about whether and when the burden of cuts will be spread to emerging economies, but are silent on the much bigger injustice wrought on the world’s poorest people.
在2017年的杀戮平息后，博茨瓦纳已经恢复对被定罪的杀人犯执行死刑；28岁的约瑟夫·特拉亚罗纳于今年2月被处决，而37岁的乌亚普·伯罗克则于今年5月被执行死刑。	After a lull in killings in 2017, Botswana has resumed executing convicted murderers; Joseph Tselayarona, 28, was executed in February, while Uyapo Poloko, 37, was put to death in May.
鉴于脱盟的关键动机是恢复该国所谓丧失了的主权，一场英国没有发言权却必须掏钱和服从的交易显然让人难以接受。	Given that the key motivation for Brexit is to restore the country’s supposedly lost sovereignty, a deal that gives the UK no say, but requires that it pay and obey, would be deeply unpalatable.
而领导层 — — 不管是平民，军人还是目前在政治上最积极的司法人员 — — 都已经被证实是先天不足，令整个国家只剩下残破的经济以及瘫痪了的政治系统。	And that leadership – whether civilian, military, and also the now politically active judiciary – has proven congenitally ineffective, leaving the country with a broken economy and a paralyzed political system.
斯德哥尔摩 — — 近50年前，罗马俱乐部的“增长极限”报告提出警告，如果经济继续在不考虑环境承受力的基础上快速增长，那么世界有可能在21世纪面临生态和经济崩溃。	STOCKHOLM – Nearly 50 years ago, the Club of Rome’s report “Limits to Growth” warned that if economic growth continued apace without regard for the environment, the world could face ecological and economic collapse in the twenty-first century.
通过协助完成课堂规划 ， “ 桥梁”保障了在不同的学校实现一定程度的标准化，并协助教师将更多的精力集中在个体学生。	By assisting in classroom planning, Bridge ensures a degree of standardization across schools, and helps teachers focus more attention on individual students.
在这样的环境下，决定保留CFA法郎 — — 一种以大为高估的汇率盯住欧元自由可兑换共同货币 — — 是站不住脚的。	In this context, the decision to retain the CFA franc, a freely convertible common currency that is pegged to the euro at a significantly overvalued exchange rate, is dubious.
有人说只有当一个国家能够通过“两次更迭测试 ” ， 也就是两次在不发生暴力的情况下更换政府，民主才算在这个国家真正生根。	Some say that it is achieved only once a country has passed the “two-turnover test,” that is, two changes of government without violence.
但这与现实相去甚远：知识工人日益在传统办公室之外埋头苦干，检查邮件、更新报表、撰写报告、参与集体头脑风暴。	Yet nothing could be further from the truth: knowledge workers continually toil outside the traditional office, checking their email, updating spreadsheets, writing reports, and engaging in collective brainstorming.
即便是一些国家避免了眼下美元贬值的打击，他们也应该对其飞反 效应(boomerang effect) 保持警惕。	Even if countries avoid the immediate blow of a dollar collapse, they still have to watch for a boomerang effect.
事实上，用媒体的术语来说，延长白天的工时将造就更高的就业率，因为它能在保持劳动力成本不变的情况下提高生产效率。	In fact, extending daily working times will, in the medium term, also result in higher employment, because it will increase productivity while labor costs remain constant.
我察觉到这样一种意愿正在日渐增强，即我们应舍弃创新带来的好处（特别是金融创新 ） ， 以换取较慢的变革速度，后者被认为更易为人们所控制。	The fiscal balances of the G-20 economies will deteriorate dramatically as a result of the crisis. Deficits will improve somewhat as economies recover and support measures are withdrawn.
圣地亚哥—商品价格重回人间，美联储也将逐渐退出量化宽松，这推高了美国的利率，拉美经济体面临可持续增长的挑战。	SANTIAGO – As commodity prices come back to earth and the Federal Reserve’s gradual exit from quantitative easing leads to higher interest rates in the United States, Latin America’s economies face the challenge of sustaining growth.
那些拥有正式工作的幸运儿（不到40 % ） 常常由“副业”用时间、专业知识、网络或点子赚取外快，以对冲不确定的劳动力市场。	Those lucky men and women who have formal jobs (less than 40%) often have “side hustles” through which they sell their time, expertise, network, or ideas to others in an effort to hedge against an uncertain labor market.
但这并非偶然，在从1970年代末一直延续到1992年的大宗商品价格暴跌过程就伴随着一众发展中国家超过10年的主权债务危机。	It is no accident that the last commodity-price collapse, which ran from the late 1970s until 1992, coincided with more than a decade of sovereign-debt crises in the developing world.
至少在西方人看来，凯南1946年2月发自莫斯科的“长电报”以及1947年6月他以“X”为署名发表在《外交事务 》 （ Foreign Affairs）上的著名文章找到了冷战的智识根源。	Kennan is reckoned to have laid the Cold War’s intellectual foundation – at least in the West – with his “long telegram” from Moscow in February 1946, which he followed with his famous Foreign Affairs article, signed “X,” in July 1947.
毕竟，由于发展本地资本市场、改善私有化过程的透明度符合地区决策者的利益，进一步出售国有资产将通过公开股票市场进行。	After all, any further sales of state-owned assets will be conducted through public equity markets, owing to the interest of the region’s policymakers in developing local capital markets and improving the transparency of the privatization process.
而今年一年估计会有 6500 多人在冲突中死于非命，不但超过了去年的总和，更是 2007 年的两倍。	More than 6,500 fatalities will have occurred this year alone, topping last year’s total, which was double that in 2007.
议会的成功与否将会取决于胜利在手的毛派主义者也就是尼泊尔共产党与其他党派精诚合作，而不是试图单方面推动其纲领。	The success or failure of the Constituent Assembly will rest on whether the presumptive winner, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists), will work collaboratively with the other parties rather than trying to push its own agenda exclusively.
老布什的入侵巴拿马并俘获（随后审判）曼努尔·诺列加（Manuel Noriega）也许破坏了巴拿马的主权，但这具有一定程度的实际合法性，因为诺列加是臭名昭著的暴君。	While Bush’s invasion of Panama to capture (and later put on trial) Manuel Noriega may have violated Panamanian sovereignty, it had a degree of de facto legitimacy, given Noriega’s notorious behavior.
科学家将这一新时期称为“人类纪 ” （ Anthropocene ） ， 即人类称为地球物质和生物变化的主要原因的时期。	Scientists call this new period the Anthropocene – in which human beings have become the main causes of the earth’s physical and biological changes.
2012年 ， 《 纽约时报》网站被中国屏蔽，原因是它报道时任中国总理温家宝的庞大家族控制着价值至少27亿美元的资产。	In 2012, the New York Times website was blocked in China after the paper reported that the extended family of China’s then prime minister, Wen Jiabao, controlled assets worth at least $2.7 billion.
在商业上，中型企业蓬勃发展的环境也被认为是可取的，因为它一方面比小企业拥有更健康的资产负债表，另一方面又不会像大企业那样倾向于寡头垄断。	In business, too, an environment in which mid-size firms flourished was viewed as desirable, because it reconciled small firms’ lack of balance-sheet strength with their larger counterparts’ tendency to slip into oligopolistic complacency.
“小农”是这个项目的基础 ， “ 小农”一词是非洲、拉美和亚洲耕种土地不超过1公顷（合2.5英亩）的农民家庭的代名词。	One cornerstone of the project was “smallholder farmers,” meaning peasant farm families in Africa, Latin America, and Asia – working farms of around one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.
在1930年代，经历过美国内战的硬派老将，前最高法院法官奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯（Oliver Wendell Holmes ） ， 前往拜会富兰克林·D·罗斯福这位当学生时不太起眼的哈佛校友。	In the 1930s, former Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a crusty old veteran of the American Civil War, was taken to meet Franklin D. Roosevelt, a fellow Harvard graduate but one who had not been a distinguished student.
东欧国家 — — 欧盟成员资格所提供的脆弱的经济进步的不安全的新来者 — — 不认为自己有这方面的义务。	The countries of Eastern Europe – insecure newcomers to the fragile economic progress offered by EU membership – do not believe that they have any obligations in this regard.
正如《时代》杂志在1987年5月正式宣布的那样，随着这类名为“高温超导铜氧化物”的发现，我们已经迎来了超导的革命。	As Time magazine proclaimed in May 1987, with the discovery of these so-called “cuprates,” the superconducting revolution had begun.
G7曾经强大，如今却被全球经济重整，更具代表性的20国集团以及新形式地区主义的崛起所挑战，而本次峰会的失败则对其造成了公然的打击。	The failed G7 summit dealt a very public blow to a once-powerful grouping that had already been challenged by global economic re-alignment, the emergence of the more representative G20, and new forms of regionalism.
塞内加尔之旅中最令我感动的事迭戈（Deggo）卫生站。 它位于达喀尔郊外，卫生工作者和社区志愿者向我们讲述了正在进行的消灭疟疾的斗争。	The most moving part of the trip was our visit to the Deggo health post, in the suburbs of Dakar, where health workers and community volunteers explained to us their ongoing efforts to fight the disease.
在这方面，政策不应该基于粗暴的总需求指标，GDP和净贸易数据，而应该用更细致的指标提供关于财富分配、教育和生活品质的更清晰的图景。	To that end, policy should be based not on blunt indicators of aggregate change, such as GDP and net trade data, but on more nuanced metrics that provide a clearer picture of wealth distribution, education, and quality of life.
从1960年到1980年，家庭储蓄率大约相当于税后收入的10—13 % ， 为厂房和设备投资提供了资金。	From 1960 to 1980, the household saving rate ranged between 10-13% of after-tax income, providing funds for investment in plant and equipment.
以中国为例，共产党复兴理念的基础是明清两代国力的最高境界代表了这个5，000年古老文明自然合理的永久状态。	In this case, the CCP’s view of rejuvenation is built on the belief that the zenith of Chinese power under the Ming and Qing dynasties represents the natural, just, and permanent state of affairs for a 5,000-year-old civilization.
与此同时，为了重启经济增长和就业引擎，我们还需要其他政策，而每个国家的初始条件不同，所需的政策也不一样。	At the same time, to restart an economy’s growth and employment engines, other measures are needed, and vary somewhat across countries, owing to different initial conditions.
实现可持续发展目标 — — 从而解决气候危机 — — 将要求我们去抵制那些试图维持现有不平等秩序的既定政治，商业和经济利益。	Achieving the SDGs – and, thus, tackling the climate crisis – will require us to stand up to the vested political, business, and economic interests that seek to maintain our current unequal order.
美国的欧洲定居者们对土著居民进行了一场长达两个世纪的种族灭绝，还建立了根深蒂固的奴隶经济，最后通过一场灾难性的内战才终结。	America’s European settlers committed a two-century-long genocide against the native inhabitants, and established a slave economy so deeply entrenched that only a devastating civil war ended it.
而由此造成的必然结果是，寻求在选举中留下痕迹的小政党彼得不把目标对准政治少数派，他们之中有很多人有着强烈的偏好和信念。	And, as a corollary, smaller parties seeking an electoral foothold have had to target political minorities, many of whom have strongly held preferences and beliefs.
当经济达到中等收入水平时，发展战略就会开始失效，而中国正在迅速达到这一水平，因此中国不能允许高企的周期性风险阻碍其结构型转型。	Given that development strategies typically begin to fail when economies reach middle-income status – a threshold that China is rapidly approaching – China cannot afford to allow mounting cyclical risks to undermine its structural transformation.
美国总统唐纳德·特朗普政府已经就与朝鲜的金融关系强制实施了对中国机构的经济制裁，因为它不相信中国已经为约束朝鲜政权做得足够多。	US President Donald Trump’s administration has imposed economic sanctions on Chinese entities with financial ties to North Korea, because it does not believe that China has done enough to constrain the North Korean regime.
我们还在另一个项目中研究了过去40年来30个国家的数据，并且表明家庭债务相对GDP比率上升会系统地导致GDP增长放缓和失业率上升。	In another study with Verner, we examined data from 30 countries over the past 40 years, and showed that rising household debt-to-GDP ratios have systematically resulted in slower GDP growth and higher unemployment.
为什么我们需要这些不健全的中介，加密货币发明者问，如果我们能够创造电子存储和交易系统，确保用户安全和潜在控制着不可见的话？	Why do we need these diseased intermediaries, cryptocurrencies’ inventors ask, when we can create electronic storage and transaction systems, secure to their users and invisible to would-be controllers?
这种安定是有道理的：如果投资者连美国经济通胀压力的影响都不在乎，那么他们肯定会对世界其他地方更有信心。	This quiescence makes sense: If investors are unperturbed by inflationary pressures in the US economy, they can surely be much more confident about the rest of the world.
应该指出，同样的因素 — — 主要是恶劣的全球环境所致 — — 让拉美左翼政党通过抨击前任的市场导向政策赢得和巩固了权力。	It should be noted that the very same factors, largely the result of unforgiving global conditions, enabled Latin America’s leftist parties to win and consolidate power by blaming the market-oriented policies that preceded them.
中国新的领导层 — — 由习近平主席和李克强总理领头 — — 似乎下定决心要结束其前任保持快速经济增长步伐的定位，并将政策重心转移到经济增长的质量之上。	China’s new leadership, headed by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, seems determined to end its predecessors’ fixation on maintaining a rapid pace of economic growth and to refocus policy on the quality of growth.
随着美国对发展中国家非银行借款机构的贷款自2008年全球金融危机以来已经翻了超过一番 — — 截止2017年底已达3.7万亿美元 — — 古巴的经历应当向人们提出警告。	With US credit to non-bank borrowers in developing countries having more than doubled since the 2008 global financial crisis – reaching $3.7 trillion at the end of 2017 – Cuba’s experience should serve as a warning.
他的变革改善了整体状况，但显然尚未达到令大多数法国人满意的程度。 据最近一项民调显示，这些民众已经无法忍受这么一个人在他们家的电视屏幕上再呆五年了。	He has changed for the better, but only up to a point, and clearly not enough for a majority of the French, who, according to recent public-opinion polls, simply cannot stand the idea of having him on their television screens for another five years.
一定程度上，由于政治论调大多是国家重建和自由，埃及以及其他地方的伊斯兰原教旨主义者将面临一场艰难的战斗。	Insofar as political discourse is focused on national rebuilding and freedom, Islamic fundamentalists, in Egypt and elsewhere, will face an uphill battle.
如果国家领袖、卫生部长和财政部长曾质疑过要在烟草产品监管方面走多远，大型烟草企业的此次认罪，加之投资者的重新考虑，已经给出了“要多远就有多远”的答案。	If national leaders, health ministers, and finance chiefs ever wondered how far they should go to regulate tobacco products, Big Tobacco’s admissions, together with investors’ second thoughts, have provided an answer: as far as necessary.
纳粹宣传机器指责犹太人是一切的祸源：德国在一战战败、阻止雅利安人取得高人一等地位的普世道德价值、共产主义和资本主义，这些都是犹太人带来的。	Nazi propaganda blamed Jews for everything: Germany’s defeat in World War I, universal moral values that prevented the Aryan race from exerting its superiority, and both communism and capitalism.
在法国，选民刚刚出于希望而非绝望选出了一位新总统；而在英国，我们将很快在6月举行又一次自由公正的选举。	In France, voters just elected a new president out of hope, not despair; and in the UK, we will soon hold another free and fair election in June.
但如果利率在特朗普时代升高（可能性很大 ） ， 美国政府将后悔当初没有选择更少短期借贷、更多长期借贷。	But if interest rates shoot up in the Trump era (as well they could), the US government will wish that it had opted for less short-term borrowing and more long-term borrowing.
但如果我们认识到上述损失并直面问题的存在，就可以避免对潜在有益技术创新的反对力量，包括推动机器人的使用。	But if we recognize these losses and address them head-on, we can avoid a backlash against potentially beneficial technological innovations, including advances in robotics.
但必须指出的是，假如来年古奈姆仍当选为巴勒斯坦当局及法塔赫的领导人，那么巴以和谈的终止和新一轮冲突自然也毫不奇怪。	Still, if Ghuneim takes over as the PA’s and Fatah’s leader, which could happen next year, a breakdown of negotiations with Israel and a new round of fighting would not be surprising.
由这一现象产生的恶劣天气 — — 起源于太平洋地区，却影响着全球所有的海洋 ，预计今年将对超过6000万人产生不利影响，延续着去年的种种痛苦。	The adverse weather resulting from the phenomenon – which originates in the Pacific, but affects the ocean worldwide – is expected to affect adversely over 60 million people this year, compounding the misery wrought last year.
我也不会详细讨论以下事实：齐普拉斯在组织对他的公投的议会支持时甚至寻求新纳粹主义政党金色黎明党（Golden Dawn）的支持，任何其他欧洲领导人都会拒绝该党的支持。	Nor will I dwell on the fact that Tsipras did not refrain, when assembling parliamentary support for his referendum, from soliciting the support of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, whose help any other European leader would have rejected.
可以满足这一用���的一个明显指标就是公共养老金体系的隐性债务 - - 即，目前现存司法体制下所有未来养老金开销的折损值。	An obvious indicator that would meet this purpose is the implicit debt of public pension systems - i.e., the present discounted value of all future pension expenditures under existing legislation.
》 （ How Should Long-Term Monetary Policy Be Determined ? ） 。 萨默斯不相信经济学的基本现实已经发生了改变，因此他的关注点在于技术性问题 — — 试图防止20世纪70年代标志辉煌年代结束的通胀性扰动卷土重来。	Summers was unconvinced that the underlying economic reality had changed, so his focus was technical – an attempt to guard against a repetition of the inflationary disturbances of the 1970s that marked the end of the glory years.
然而如果其他国家（包括发达国家）想在日益严峻的全球经济形势下寻求可行发展战略的话，都应当对这三个案例加以密切关注。	Nonetheless, all three are examples that other countries, including developed ones, should watch closely as they search for viable growth strategies in an increasingly hostile global economic environment.
这项研究再一次引发了人们关于对儿童的发热症状是否有益的争论，Fiona Russell及其同事在世界卫生组织的公告中对这一问题进行了全面的探讨。	The study has contributed to the debate as to whether it is beneficial to treat fever in children, an issue comprehensively reviewed by Fiona Russell and colleagues in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization.
它必须为巴基斯坦开辟一条达成一致共识的道路，共同从叛军手里夺回其部落领土，结束全国各个城市的恐怖风潮，确保一个新的、合法的政府通过选举产生。	It must offer Pakistan a consensual path toward winning back its tribal areas from the insurgents, end the wave of terror in its cities, and ensure the election of a new, legitimate government.
在国家层面上，在发达国家进行的社会保障体制改革以及在发展中国家进行的扩大社会保障范围的努力，应该在寻求保证更多的劳动力弹性的同时，保证更大的经济安全。	At the national level, reform of social protection systems in developed countries, and the expansion of such systems in developing countries, should seek to ensure greater economic security as well as labor flexibility.
二十世纪九十年代可能是迷失的十年，但日本的经济已开始复苏，现在以每年2%以上的速度增长，日本出现了若干真正意义上的全球化企业，这些企业全都获得了巨大成功。	The 1990’s may have been a lost decade, but Japan’s economy has begun to recover, now growing at more than 2% a year and boasting several firms that are truly global and hugely successful.
中央政府通过财政改革和反腐运动已经巩固了对整体宏观经济的掌控，但在地方层面组织实施下一阶段的结构改革，则需要巧妙的协调各种改革及宏观政策的匹配。	As the central government consolidates its power through fiscal reform and an anti-corruption campaign, orchestrating the next phase of structural reforms at the local level will require deft coordination.
由于无法意识到国际贸易有时 — — 当然不是常常 — — 会导致一些我们在国内无法接受的再分配后果，这些经济学家也无法恰当地介入公众讨论。	By ignoring the fact that international trade sometimes – certainly not always – involves redistributive outcomes that we would consider problematic at home, they fail to engage the public debate properly.
无论如何，没有哪个民主政客会抵制新的沟通媒介，特别是互动性工具 — — 即使一些政客主要把它作为公关工具。	In any case, no democratic politician should resist a new communications medium, particularly an interactive one – even if some seem to regard it mainly as a public-relations tool.
在美国，主张继续出台一揽子刺激方案的人认为，以刺激计划的7870亿美元来抵消私人部门减支3万亿美元的影响实在是一厢情愿。	In the United States, those who argue for another stimulus package observe that it was always wishful thinking to believe that a $787 billion package could offset a $3 trillion fall in private spending.
这一状况在时任总书记江泽民和国务院总理朱镕基任上发生了改变，江泽民和朱镕基通过权力集中避免了中国银行风险上升带来的经济危机。	This changed when then-Party leader Jiang Zemin and his prime minister, Zhu Rongji, centralized authority in order to stave off economic crisis at a time of growing risk to China’s banks.
最新的治疗可能性包括将触珠蛋白与血红蛋白一起注入循环系统，或者将维生素C作为添加成分，以此增加安全有效的血液替代品开发的成功机会。	Some recent therapeutic possibilities include the co-infusion of haptoglobin with hemoglobin in circulation or with vitamin C – additives that hold promising implications for the development of safe and effective blood substitutes.
能够广泛地、更灵活地进入劳动力市场，儿童教育设施的普及，以及金融激励，让女性劳动力参与率提高到70%以上，为工业化国家的最高水平之一。	Broader, more flexible access to the labor market, expansion of early childhood facilities, and financial incentives have driven an increase in female labor-force participation to more than 70%, one of the highest in the industrialized world.
而你在孟买，德里，班加罗尔，浦那以及其他欣欣向荣的印度商贸中心所碰到的商界领袖们都向你展现了树立国内和国际品牌所遇到的挑战。	The business leaders you meet in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, and the other buzzing commercial centers of India demonstrate the challenge of building national and global brands and businesses.
现在，拉姆斯菲尔德终于认识到赢得人心的重要性，但是，正如经济学家杂志所指出的那样 ， “ 他讲话的大部分集中在美国如何运用滑头的公关赢得宣传战争 ” 。	Now Rumsfeld finally realizes the importance of winning hearts and minds, but, as The Economist put it, “a good part of his speech was focused on how with slicker PR America could win the propaganda war.”
如果不对天安号的沉没做出国际统一的强烈反应，那么这样鲁莽的挑衅不仅有可能继续下去，而且还可能更为变本加厉。	Without a strong and internationally coordinated response to the sinking of the Cheonan, such reckless provocations are not only likely to continue, but may become more frequent.
而对这种角色的滥用 — — 比如政府利用通胀的方式摆脱巨额债务 — — 对二十世纪前半叶的政治秩序造成了极大破坏。	Abuse of this role, with governments addressing excessive debt by inflating it away, was deeply destructive of political order in the first half of the twentieth century.
世界有动力 — — 也有方法 — — 为可持续金融创造大众市场，让投资决定兼顾E&S和好治理标准以及信誉。	The world has the momentum – and the means – to create a mass market for sustainable finance, one in which investment decisions are driven as much by E&S and good governance criteria as by creditworthiness.
这种不公的感觉在美国只得到了政治考量的部分控制，而这多亏了“奥巴马因素 ” ， 这一罕见的现象可以被形容为恢复对政治领导人的信任。	This sense of injustice is only partly contained by political considerations in the US, thanks to the “Obama factor,” a rare phenomenon that can be described as the restoration of trust in one’s political leaders.
最有可能发生的是更多的重复：紧缩、经济进一步疲软、失业进一步抬头、居高不下的赤字，而欧洲领导人在抵御眼下的危机方面一直不肯动手。	The most likely scenario is more of the same: austerity, weaker economies, more unemployment, and continuing deficits, with European leaders doing the minimum to fend off crisis for the moment.
马尼拉—中国在南海大肆拓地刚刚过去五年，已将南海领土现状朝着有利于它的方向发展，而没有面临任何国际反击。	MANILA – It has been just five years since China initiated its major land reclamation in the South China Sea, and the country has already shifted the territorial status quo in its favor – without facing any international pushback.
但嘲弄中国是“贸易骗子”的人应该深思，如果它在2001年之前成为世贸组织成员，或如果它在2001年之后一丝不苟地履行世贸组织规则，它还能不能如此迅速地实现经济多样化和增长。	But those who derisively call China a “trade cheat” should ponder whether China would have been able to diversify its economy and grow as rapidly if it had become a member of the WTO before 2001, or if it had slavishly applied WTO rules since then.
2010年5月，IMF预测 — — 大概是在赞同其欧洲伙伴的观点 — — 2012年希腊年GDP增长将在1%以上。	In May 2010, the International Monetary Fund projected – presumably in concurrence with its European partners – that Greece’s annual GDP growth would exceed 1% in 2012.
一个显著的例子是约旦的扎塔里难民营（Za’atari Camp ） ， 现在那里居住了80,000难民；类似的难民营在黎巴嫩和其他域内国家也能找到。	A prime example is the Za’atari Camp in Jordan, which now hosts 80,000 residents; but similar camps can be found in Lebanon and other countries around the region.
但除非解决“抵制”问题，否则不可能达到这样的目的：如果大部分债主同意减少或推迟收款，就会导致单个债权人借其他债权人的痛苦坚持要求全额偿付始终具有极大的诱惑力。	But this is impossible unless the “holdout” problem is solved: if a majority of creditors agree to reduce or postpone their claims, it is always tempting for an individual creditor to hold out for full payment by free riding on other creditors’ pain.
美国银行提供房屋价值100%的贷款，有时甚至更多，而次级房贷市场甚至包括向没有工作和收入的人提供贷款。	US banks finance up to 100% of a house’s value, sometimes even more, and the sub-prime market even includes loans to people without jobs and income.
选民们尤其担心工作会被成群结队的东欧移民抢走，价格低廉的波兰管道工是当时东欧移民在欧洲人心目中的普遍形象。	In particular, voters were afraid that their jobs would be lost to hordes of Eastern immigrants, exemplified in the image widely quoted at the time, of the low-cost Polish plumber.
它应该承担责任，像希望世界如何应对它的苦难那样应对今天的难民危机 — — 并证明欧盟价值观远远不局限于它的边界之内。	And it should take the opportunity to respond to today’s refugee crisis as it would have liked the world to respond to its suffering – and to prove that the EU’s value extends far beyond its borders.
在2011年到来之际，依然各有5万和10万名美军士兵驻守在伊拉克和阿富汗两地 — — 这一切似乎永无宁日，但它确实即将走向终结。	As 2011 begins, with 50,000 US soldiers still in Iraq and another 100,000 in Afghanistan, it may not look like that era is coming to an end. But it is.
但从智利主要政策的角度，即便Enríquez-Ominami最终获胜，持续性几乎仍将肯定成为主旋律。	In terms of Chile’s major policies, however, continuity is almost certain to prevail, even if Enríquez-Ominami wins.
在毛泽东统治时代，当时的中国共产党正处于向东京寻求调节、外交承认和海外发展援助之时，中国人在西方和日本帝国主义挟制下，无法正视过去所遭受的迫害。	Under Mao, when the Chinese Communist Party sought accommodation, diplomatic recognition, and overseas development aid from Japan, Chinese were not allowed to confront their past victimization at the hands of Western and Japanese imperialism.
首席信息官还需要认真地考虑信息安全问题，在这一点他或她应该与其他国家的首席信息官进行合作，因为网络犯罪是没有国界的。	The CIO also needs to take a serious look at information security – in conjunction with the CIOs of other countries (since cybercrime knows no borders).
奥巴马希望跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership，TPP）能在2015年敲定，并由获得美国参议院通过。	Obama hopes that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will be concluded in 2015 and ratified by the US Senate.
在很多案例中 — — 目前在北非和中东引发示威的视频就是其中之一 — — 在冒犯性材料的散播和公众愤怒的爆发之间会有很长的时间间隔。	At times, as seems to be the case with the video that triggered the current protests in cities across North Africa and the Middle East, a long period may elapse between the offensive material’s dissemination and an outpouring of popular rage.
随后，11年1月，中国国家主席胡锦涛成功对美国进行国事访问。 然而，与此同时，中国国内舆论多对美国“压制”中国和平崛起表示不满。	Chinese President Hu Jintao’s subsequent official visit to Washington in January 2011 was successful, but many Chinese editorialists complained that the US was trying to “contain” China and prevent its peaceful rise.
意大利最近一次公投显示大部分民众反对核能应用，对这项高风险技术越来越强的反对力量将决定欧洲在经济和生态方面的未来。	Europe’s economic and ecological future, however, depends upon the rising opposition to this high-risk technology, such as in Italy, where a recent referendum delivered a large popular majority against nuclear energy.
这就要求改变其行长的挑选方式。 美国国会13年来第一次就世界银行问题举行听证会，我同其他作证的人一样呼吁进行这一关键改革。	This requires a change in how its president is chosen, and, at Congressional hearings on the World Bank – the first in 13 years – I, like everyone who testified, called for this key reform.
今年早些时候，特朗普赞赏中国在这发面所做出的承诺，尽管中国在奥巴马执政期间已经做出过这些承诺 — — 并且食言了。	Earlier this year, Trump praised China for making promises on this front, even though it had already made – and broken – the same promises to the Obama administration.
就像地中海悲惨局势所表明的那样，这样的压力非常强势，仅今年前四个月就有超过一千名难民在从非洲到欧洲的危险旅途中丧生。	And those pressures are powerful, as demonstrated by the tragic situation in the Mediterranean Sea, where more than a thousand refugees on the treacherous route from Africa to Europe died in the first four months of this year.
在执行了超过5年之后，该政策已经在人们脑中植入了根深蒂固的持续低利率甚至负实际利率预期 — — 正如一位评论家所指出，这更像一剂上瘾的止痛药而非治病救人的抗生素。	After more than five years, QE has arguably entrenched expectations for continued low or even negative real interest rates – acting more like addictive painkillers than powerful antibiotics, as one commentator has put it.
1900年，拉丁美洲新教徒只占人口的2.2 % ， 但到2010年，这一数字为16.4 % 。 新教徒人数的增长大多来自天主教徒改宗，后者占人口比例从90.4%降至82.3 % 。	Protestants in Latin America accounted for only 2.2% of the population in 1900, but 16.4% in 2010, with growth coming mainly at the expense of Catholics, whose population share fell from 90.4% to 82.3%.
问题在于亚洲基础设施投资，特别是来自中国的投资，是会用于建设中央王国的亚洲卫星，还是成为大家平等使用的工具。	The question is whether Asia’s infrastructure investments, particularly those by China, will be used to create Asian satellites of the Middle Kingdom, or become tools to be used among equals.
事实上，23年前在天安门广场镇压后，持不同政见的方励芝跑去美国大使馆避难，23年后，陈光诚的唯一选择也是最终投入美国外交的怀抱。	Indeed, 23 years after dissident Fang Lizhi took refuge in the US embassy following the crackdown in Tiananmen Square, Chen’s only option was to take the same last-gasp leap into the arms of American diplomats.
以色列政府最近提示说伊朗可能在九个月内达到核门槛，而伊朗问题也会成为现在到2012年12月美国总统大选之间这段长时期的热门话题。	The Israeli government recently suggested that Iran would reach the nuclear threshold within nine months, and Iran could become a major issue in the long run-up to the US presidential election in November 2012.
一个月之内，芝加哥商业交易所将与我的公司宏观市场研究公司、Fiserv公司和标准普尔一道推出美国国内10个城市的住房价格期货和期权合同。	Within a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in collaboration with my company, MacroMarkets, as well as Fiserv and Standard & Poor’s, will launch futures and options contracts on home prices in ten cities in the United States.
中央情报局开始与土耳其秘密合作向所谓的“自由叙利亚军”和其他以颠覆巴沙尔为目标的叛军集团输送军备、资金和非致命支持。	The CIA began to work covertly with Turkey to channel arms, financing, and non-lethal support to the so-called “Free Syrian Army” and other insurgent groups operating to topple Assad.
这些分散的数据告诉我们，劳动力市场的状况绝不是缓慢而稳健的改善，而是处于分裂、速度各异的状态 — — 其特征更能体现经济的结构。	Rather than confirming the paradigm of gradual and steady improvement, these disaggregated numbers attest to a highly segmented, multi-speed labor market – one with features that could become more deeply embedded in the structure of the economy.
据此在 2009 年的工作进程中，欧盟向好几个国家派遣了选举观察团，包括莫桑比克、阿富汗、几内亚比绍、黎巴嫩，马拉维和玻利维亚。	So, during the course of 2009, the EU sent election observation missions to various countries, including Mozambique, Afghanistan, Guinea Bissau, Lebanon, Malawi, and Bolivia.
为解决这一问题，20世纪90年代早期曾引入混合选举制度，即同一选区内四分之三的席位仍由多数规则确定，而其余则按比例代表制产生。	In an attempt to solve the problem, a mixed electoral system was introduced in the early 1990's, with about three quarters of the seats assigned under plurality rule in single member districts and the rest allocated under proportional representation.
由“开放社会正义行动”机构（Open Society Justice Initiative）新发布的一个报告显示，因为只将目标锁定在少数派种族上，警局疏远了那些他们本可以依赖于合作、提供情报的一些人。	As a new report by the Open Society Justice Initiative shows, by targeting ethnic minorities, police alienate some of the very people on whom they depend for cooperation and intelligence.
贸易保护主义不仅仅表现在提高进口产品的关税上。 任何政府阻碍货物，服务，资本的流动，任何有碍全球生产力的提高，有利于本国制造商或服务商的行为都可以看作是贸易保护主义。	Protectionism is not just about raising tariffs on imports; it is any government action that distorts the global production and allocation of goods, services, and capital to favor domestic producers, thereby reducing overall efficiency.
以及一位叫米洛斯拉夫·德容季奇的塞族地方官员的证词 — — 当时卡拉季奇跟他说 ： “ 米洛斯拉夫，这些人必须杀掉 。 ”	A Serb district president, Miroslav Deronjić, testified that Karadžić told him: “Miroslav, those people there must be killed.”
曾经是欧盟远见和创造力来源的欧盟委员会已经成为现行不合理和破坏性规则及制度的狂热捍卫者，他们固步自封的理由是任何让步都会带来更多的要求。	The European Commission, once the EU’s source of visionary creativity, has become a fanatical defender of existing rules and regulations, however irrational and destructive, on the grounds that any concessions will beget more demands.
然而，对于未来的新保守主义者来说，二十世纪六十年代有的是横跨一场失败的战争的羞辱和尼克松的声名狼藉所带来的“心理创伤 ” 。	For future neo-conservatives, however, the 1960’s produced a “trauma” that transcended the humiliation of a lost war and the disgrace of Richard Nixon.
据研究者芝加哥大学教授吴静和夏凡估计，美联储的无限期资产购买计划（所谓的量化宽松政策或QE）导致美国实际政策利率为-1.6 % 。	The researchers Cynthia Wu and Fan Dora Xia estimate that the US Federal Reserve’s open-ended asset purchases (so-called quantitative easing, or QE) have led to an effective US policy rate of -1.6%.
这首先意味着我们必须避免沦为2003年的美国 — — 当时小布什总统将“全球反恐战争”扩大到伊拉克。	That means, above all, that we must avoid becoming like America in 2003, when President George W. Bush extended the “global war on terror” to Iraq.
它不仅适合那种时常阴冷下点小雨的气候，而且相对于其重量来说也令人惊讶地保暖 — — 无论是在潮湿或干燥状态下。	Not only is it perfect for a cloudy, drizzly climate, it is also surprisingly warm – wet or dry – for its weight.
法国总统马克龙在2018年7月访问了尼日利亚，做出了一个大胆的预测：如果非洲最年轻的企业家们努力工作和创新，能够改变他们的国家和全世界。	When French President Emmanuel Macron visited Nigeria in July 2018, he offered a bold prediction: if Africa’s youngest entrepreneurs worked hard and innovated, he said, they would change their countries and transform the world.
没有收声的勇敢的俄罗斯民主派已经指出，普京在吞并克里米亚时所抛出的诉求与希特勒在1938年德奥合并和苏台德危机中的立场并无区别。	Brave Russian democrats who have not yet been silenced have already remarked on the similarity between Putin’s appeal to ethnic solidarity in annexing Crimea and Hitler’s stance during the Anschluss and the Sudeten crisis in 1938.
新的数据证实，2015年是有记录以来最热的一年，并表明今年前两个月的全球气温将继续维持在破记录的高位。	The new data confirm that 2015 was the hottest year on record, and show that the global run of record-breaking temperatures continued through the first two months of this year.
比如，以色列民意可能因耶路撒冷演讲而被激发起来，支持和平；或者美国国务卿克里能够在引导谈判方面顺利前进。	For example, Israeli public opinion could become galvanized in support of peace in the wake of the Jerusalem address, or US Secretary of State John Kerry could make headway in initiating talks.
CCI表明，富国的腐败情况比穷国少，但相对腐败更少的国家，比如加纳、哥斯达黎加和丹麦，并不比发展水平相当的国家增长更快。	The CCI shows that while rich countries tend to be less corrupt than poor ones, countries that are relatively less corrupt, for their level of development, such as Ghana, Costa Rica, or Denmark, do not grow any faster than others.
叙利亚政府可以这样合理解读美国的政策 ： “ 我们会在你们恐吓或伤害本国民众的时候袖手旁观、无所作为，只要你们不使用化武 。 ”	The Syrian government could reasonably interpret US policy as follows: “We will stand by and do nothing while you terrorize or kill your own people so long as you do not use chemical weapons.”
在这方面，我们值得回顾美国五星上将乔治·马歇尔的洞见。 他在20世纪40年代重建美军时思考过这个问题。	Here, it is worth recalling the insights of US General George C. Marshall, who contemplated the topic as he worked to rebuild the US military in the 1940s.
他们的缄默带来的好处是历史上首个民主国家与共产主义独裁政府间的联合内阁会议 — — 将于今年秋天在柏林举行。	That silence is being rewarded with the first-ever joint cabinet sessions between a democracy and a communist dictatorship, which will take place in Berlin this autumn.
当这一幕发生时，我们可以预期，地表温度的升高速度将回到20世纪后期所观察到的速度，即每十年升高0.15摄氏度左右。	When they do, we can expect the increase to resume the rapid pace observed during the late twentieth century, when surface temperature rose by about 0.17 degrees Celsius every ten years.
军事撤退之后骚乱增加，国外的美军对那些试图进入索马里的杰哈德圣战者进行监视和拦截，肯尼亚和埃塞俄比亚则防止骚乱越过这一地区向外转移。	As unrest mounted with these military retreats, offshore US forces monitored and intercepted jihadists who sought to enter Somalia, while Kenya and Ethiopia blocked the unrest from metastasizing across the region.
但它绝不会容忍任何军事用途，也不支持围绕上述设施设立超过500米的“安全区 ” — —不属于领海、专属经济区 、 “ 防空识别区”或其他任何范畴。	But it does not tolerate any military use, or support more than a 500-meter “safety zone” around such installations – not a territorial sea, EEZ, “air defense identification zone,” or anything else.
尽管拉美和中国对美国的出口额自1990年起增幅显著，但在2003年，中国的贸易额上赶上墨西哥，并取代它成为美国之后加拿大的第二大贸易伙伴。	Although Latin American and Chinese exports to the US have both grown significantly since 1990, China replaced Mexico in 2003 as the second-leading exporter to the US in value terms after Canada.
中国的新策略还包括更为频繁的高层外交接触，除日本外，还重点关注其他主要地区参与者，如韩国、印度尼西亚和越南。	China’s new tactics also include more frequent high-level diplomatic engagement, focused on leading regional players, such as South Korea, Indonesia, and Vietnam, in addition to Japan.
当时的日本比现在的哥伦比亚高80 % ， 当时的法国比现在的突尼斯高42 % ， 当时的荷兰比现在的土耳其高250 % ， 当时的意大利比现在的印尼高470 % 。	It was 80% higher in Japan back then than in Colombia today, 42% higher in old France than in current Tunisia, 250% higher in the old Netherlands than in current Turkey, and 470% higher in old Italy than in current Indonesia.
尽管TPP在去年遭受重挫 — — 特朗普宣布美国退出了该协议 — — 但上个月，11个仍参与协议的环太平洋国家表示要将TPP坚持到底。	Though the TPP suffered a setback last year, when Donald Trump withdrew the United States, last month the 11 Pacific Rim countries remaining in the deal committed to keeping it alive.
但如果说蒋医生在这个过程中成为了一位英雄，那么他同时也被被标定为一个不听话的人，那种让中共担心的，暗地里不服管束的人。	But if Dr. Jiang became a hero in the process, he was also marked as insubordinate, the kind of potentially uncontrollable person that the Chinese Communist Party fears.
对于“新自由主义”的信念还建立在美国经济成功的基础之上。 美国经济在九十年代的大部分时间里好像展示了自由市场的优越性。	Belief in “neoliberalism” also was based on the success of the US economy, which for much of the 1990’s seemed to demonstrate the superiority of free markets.
最近，奥巴马的连任竞选活动对此进行了反击，放出了一则电视广告，广告中一位妇女说：这是“当女人的恐怖时刻 。 ” 这句话是针对罗姆尼的，后者说他支持禁止堕胎。	Recently, President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign counter-attacked, releasing a television advertisement in which a woman says that it is “a scary time to be a woman,” because Mitt Romney has said that he supports outlawing abortion.
上述举措将对整个教育体制产生积极的影响，因为非洲卡内基梅隆大学正在积极采取措施大幅提高女性科学人才的入学率。	These commitments will have a positive effect on the entire institution, as CMU-Africa seeks to increase dramatically enrollment of female scientists.
那么对这一观点 — — 对自由的推动只不过是一项地缘政治工具 — — 的普遍承认对谁最有好处？ 答案就是世界上最庞大，最古老，也最强大的独裁国家 — — 中国。	No one has a greater interest in broad acceptance of this noxious idea – that promotion of human freedom is nothing more than a geopolitical tool – than the world’s largest, oldest, and most powerful autocracy, China.
用“可怕的后果”来警告叙利亚政权不要使用化学武器其实只意味着一点 : “ 随便轰炸你自己的平民，不过只可以用传统的武器 。 ”	Threatening the Syrian regime with “terrible consequences” if it were to use chemical weapons means only one thing: “Bomb your civilians at will, but use only conventional munitions.”
这些发现，再加上其他教育和营养政策方面的建议，都已经呈献给要求制定行动计划的安达拉邦首席部长钠拉·钱德拉巴布·奈杜（Nara Chandrababu Naidu ） 。	These findings, along with other recommendations on education and nutrition policies, have been presented to Andhra Pradesh’s chief minister, Nara Chandrababu Naidu, who has requested an action plan.
从更广义的角度讲，必须设计一套涵盖所有直接相关方的和平及安全框架 — — 包括韩国、日本、俄罗斯和中国。	More broadly, a framework for peace and security that includes all the directly affected parties – South Korea, Japan, Russia, and China – will need to be designed.
一个世纪前，经济学家兼政治学家约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter）指出，市场经济的最大好处是其创新能力。	A century ago, the economist and political scientist Joseph Schumpeter argued that the central virtue of a market economy was its capacity to innovate.
有鉴于此，脱欧者声称英国 — — 作为净进口国 — — 将在与欧盟的贸易谈判中处于强势地位的说法就是错误的。	Given this, Brexiteers are wrong to claim that the UK, as a net importer, will be in a strong position in trade negotiations with the EU.
有些，比如2008到2009年的斯里兰卡内战集中在相对较小的区域，从而导致该国大部分地区（以及经济）并未受到影响。	Some, like the 2008-2009 Sri Lankan civil war, are concentrated in a relatively small area, leaving much of the country – and thus the economy – unaffected.
研习经济史的学生都知道 ， “ 沃尔克时刻”不仅是“打赢抗通胀战争”的催化剂，也成为数十年央行传统智慧变革的历史根由。	This “Volcker moment” was, as students of economic history know, the catalyst not only for “winning the war against inflation,” but also for a multi-decade shift in conventional wisdom about central banking.
政府将“去除不同外国投资类型之间的区别，特别是外国组合投资和外国直接投资的区别，而对他们采取综合上限管理 。 ”	"The government would “do away with the distinction between different types of foreign investments, especially between foreign portfolio investments and foreign direct investments, and replace them with composite caps."""
如果莫拉维茨基担任总理，卡钦斯基可以继续利用当前非政府人士的身份来控制政府，而不必为政府的政策或行动负责。	With Morawiecki as prime minister, Kaczyński can continue to use his current non-governmental role to control the government without having to take responsibility for its policies or actions.
尽管以色列一开始担心在西奈半岛边境另一端出现伊斯兰政府，但穆斯林兄弟会的价值 — — 其影响加沙主要政治势力哈马斯的能力 — — 很快凸显无疑。	Although Israel was initially apprehensive about an Islamist government across its Sinai border, the Muslim Brotherhood’s value – its ability to influence Hamas, the dominant political force in Gaza – quickly became apparent.
这是一场伊斯兰世界大多数普通人以及一小部分企图压制他人接收其高度意识形态化和政治化的宗教版本的人之间的内战。	It is a civil war within Islam between a majority of normal people and a small minority who want to coerce others into a accepting a highly ideological and politicized version of their religion.
虽然马纳福特的审判 — — 他所面临的两项指控中的第一项 — — 并未直接涉及特朗普（至少到目前为止情况仍然如此 ） ， 但人们普遍认为这是刺激特朗普的因素，导致特朗普最近的表现甚至比以往更加颠倒。	While Manafort’s trial – the first of two he faces – does not directly involve Trump (at least so far), it is believed to be one of the things agitating Trump, who has seemed even more unhinged than usual lately.
它们为当地研究创新人士提供了了解外人可能永远无法了解的机遇的平台，并在完全切合设计目的的环境中设计和评估他们的想法。	They provide a platform for local researchers and innovators to recognize opportunities that an outsider may never see, and to develop and evaluate their ideas in the precise environment for which they are designed.
证据显示其他因素，比如经济和政治机构的质量，在决定一个国家可以吸引多少资本的问题上至少是同等重要的。	The evidence suggests that other factors such as the quality of economic and political institutions are at least as important in determining how much capital a country will attract.
同时，西班牙允许四艘美国海军驱逐舰驻防不仅对北约导弹防御意义重大，而且能够确保整个地中海区域的安全。	And, by hosting the four US Navy destroyers, Spain is making a vital contribution not just to NATO’s missile defense, but also to security throughout the Mediterranean region.
至少从2011年开始，世界就看到了这一性别差距的迹象，但关于这一差距的规模哦、性质和原因的数据很少。	The world has had evidence of this gender gap since at least 2011, but only limited data about its scope, shape, and causes.
比如，政府在配置资源 — — 如采矿权和无线频段 — — 方面无法做到透明导致了法院干预和需求变化。	For example, the government’s inability to allocate resources such as mining rights or wireless spectrum in a transparent way led the courts to intervene and demand change.
他没有意识到的是，即使是这个世界上最强大的国家都仍然需要一系列公正的全球规则以及对其进行监管的一批中立机构。	What he doesn’t realize is that even the world’s most powerful country still needs impartial global rules and disinterested institutions to oversee them.
欧盟购买量占英国出口的半数以上，而英国则只占欧盟其他国家出口的略超过十分之一 — — 这恐怕构不成有利的谈判位置。	The EU buys half of Britain’s exports, whereas the UK accounts for only a little more than a tenth of exports from the rest of the EU – hardly a strong negotiating position.
对美国战略态势的修正本应是对俄罗斯侵略行径和违规行为（尤其是在东欧）以及中国在世界舞台上越来越强硬态度的合理反应。	Revisions to America’s strategic posture would be a reasonable response to Russian aggression and rule-breaking, particularly in Eastern Europe, and to China’s growing assertiveness on the world stage.
十年以后，肯·凯西与他那帮自称“快乐调皮鬼”的哥们开着一辆自己粉刷过的巴士（当然车上也不乏搭便车的美女）又从相反的方向穿越了这个国家。	A decade later, Ken Kesey took his buddies, the Merry Pranksters, across the country in the other direction in their painted bus (granted, with female hangers-on).
事实上，在阿富汗保留军事基地可能让美国陷入针对军阀和割据势力的长期低强度战争，其风险或许比由此带来的地缘政治优势更大。	In fact, the risk of becoming locked in a protracted, low-intensity war against militancy and warlordism is likely to outweigh any geopolitical advantages that the US would gain from military bases in the country.
9月12日，欧洲委员会将提交关于单一银行监督机制（Single Banking Supervisory Mechanism）的方案。 该机制将基于三大关键原则：	On September 12, the Commission will present its proposals for a Single Banking Supervisory Mechanism based on three key principles:
一些疾病或症状 — — 包括便秘、嗅觉失灵、恶性黑色素瘤和快速动眼（REM）睡眠障碍 — — 也与帕金森病的高发病率有关。	Certain diseases or symptoms – including constipation, loss of smell, malignant melanoma, and impaired rapid eye movement (REM) sleep – also appear to be associated with a higher risk of developing the disease.
ampnbsp;ampnbsp;ampnbsp; 许多华尔街金融人士家中早已堆金砌玉，现在又重返其低赤字的财政宗教。	Many Wall Street financiers, having received their gobs of cash, are returning to their fiscal religion of low deficits.
比如说，在货币政策方面，布雷顿森林会议在1944年创立了世界货币基金组织，而组织的成员国数量也最终扩大到184个。	For example, on monetary affairs, the Bretton Woods conference created the International Monetary Fund in 1944, and it has since expanded to include 186 countries.
我们的针对私营企业的部门，即国际金融公司（ IFC ） ， 正要推出或扩大三项服务，在未来三年内预计将达到约300亿美元，以帮助私营部门。	Our private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), is launching or expanding three facilities to help the private sector, expected to total around $30 billion over the next three years.
这俨然让我们回到了英王亨利八世执政的时代 — — 这位冲动癫狂的君主被一群财阀，马屁精和谄媚者所包围着，所有人都试图保持国家这艘大船不沉的情况下尽量给自己捞好处。	It is as if we have returned to the days of Henry VIII, an impulsive, deranged monarch who was surrounded by a gaggle of plutocrats, lickspittles, and flatterers, all trying to advance their careers while keeping the ship of state afloat.
美国和拥有页岩能源技术方面的领先优势，并建成了巨大的输油管道、炼油厂和能源部门港口网络，可以直接用于页岩气和页岩油（尽管也需要大量新投资 ） 。	It also enjoys a technological lead in shale-energy technologies, and it already has a vast network of pipelines, refineries, and ports in the energy sector that can be repurposed for shale gas and oil (though much more investment will be needed).
所有的北约成员国都必须明白，北约成员资格带来了确保其军队具有在现代战场上战斗并取胜的能力的明示和默示的义务。	All NATO countries must understand that membership brings implicit and explicit responsibilities to ensure that their military forces have the capability to fight and win on the modern-day battlefield.
病人的同意应该是一切医疗手段的前提，只要这个病人是有完全行为能力的成年人，并且处于可以自己做决定的状态。	A patient’s informed consent should be a prerequisite for all medical treatment, as long as the patient is a competent adult in a position to make a decision.
强硬派民族主义者也许不会关注，但足够多的边缘疑欧派可能会重新思考他们的立场，从而扭转52 % - 48%的脱欧公投多数。	Hard-core nationalists might pay no attention, but enough marginal Euroskeptics would probably reconsider their positions to flip the 52%-48% Brexit majority the other way.
而尽管有人多人认为不平等性比以往任何时候都更加严重，但在这个最为关键的指标上，不平等性是下降的：穷国和富国之间的寿命预期差距大幅缩小。	And while there is much talk of inequality being worse than ever, on this most vital measure, inequality is decreasing: the gap between life expectancy in poor and rich countries has narrowed dramatically.
1951年，法国总理Rene Pléven提议设立一个与ECSC相近的欧洲防卫共同体（European Defense Community，简称EDC ） 。	In 1951, French Prime Minister Rene Pléven proposed establishing a European Defense Community (EDC) alongside the ECSC.
在危机前，他们抵制监管、反对政府投资和规划；危机后，他们要求 — — 并得到了 — — 数十亿美元补偿自己的损失，即使是那些原本很容易就能预防的损失。	Before a crisis, they resist regulations and oppose government investment and planning; afterwards, they demand – and receive – billions of dollars to compensate them for their losses, even those that could easily have been prevented.
突尼斯罢黜因·阿比丁·本·阿里标志着曾备受西方领袖赞誉的阿拉伯“稳定”模式一败涂地，这种模式的实质是独裁主义和高估的经济业绩。	Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s ouster in Tunisia signalled the collapse of the Arab “stability” model, praised by many Western leaders, consisting of authoritarianism and overrated economic performance.
但总体而言，城市平均收入至少是农村的四倍还多，表明在这样的财务状况下生活甚至比生活在农村贫困线以下更为艰苦。	But, overall, the average income in cities is at least four times higher than that in the countryside, suggesting that living on such a budget may be even tougher than living at the rural poverty line.
今天，经济学概论课程大多采用著名教授编写的教科书，作者（通常是男性）以自己的方式向学生灌输传统智慧。	Today, introductory economics is taught using a textbook in which an eminent professor authoritatively bestows the conventional wisdom on his or her (typically, his) students.
尽管阿拉伯城市众多女性在公共场合的确面临遭到口头辱骂和身体损害的双重风险，她们还必须面对诸如卫生条件差、厕所及洁净水供应有限以及鲜有隐私等难堪的问题。	Although many women in Arab cities do risk verbal and physical abuse when they are in public, they must also contend with issues like poor sanitation, limited access to toilets and clean water, and little privacy.
距离新德里一小时行程的一个小镇，一位男性穆斯林因为据传屠宰并吃掉了一只牛而被打死。 牛是印度教的圣物。	A Muslim man was beaten to death by a mob in a small town an hour from New Delhi in response to rumors that he had slaughtered and eaten a cow, sacred to Hindus.
模糊的措辞使得它们能以任意和选择性的方式来加以运用，而那些试图挑战现状的新闻自由倡导者所受到的审查则越来越严厉。	Their vague wording allows them to be applied in a selective and arbitrary manner, and press-freedom advocates that seek to challenge the status quo are coming under increased scrutiny.
其风格几乎是科学性质的，即实际的态度、前后不连贯并且不带有情感，它与中国所要求的进行一次令人信服的调查，并且有悔悟的举动从而也许能忘却这段苦痛和依然残害着人们心灵的过去已经作出了很大进展。	Its style is almost scientific – factual, staccato-like, and unemotional – and it goes a long way toward meeting China’s demand for a convincing investigation and act of contrition that might allow the bitter and still poisonous past to be overcome.
通过此方法确诊的双相障碍患者与自己报告曾被诊断为双相障碍但却没有被SCID确诊的人相比较，前者的直系亲属罹患双相障碍的风险要比后者的直系亲属高出许多。	Patients with SCID-diagnosed bipolar disorder had a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder in their immediate family members than patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID.
为了缓和卢比的升值从而增加外部需求，印度储备银行（印度最受尊敬的机构之一，由一批合格的专业人士组建）必须得到更大的政策空间和自主权。	To mitigate the rupee’s appreciation, thereby boosting external demand, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) – one of India’s most respected institutions, populated by qualified professionals – must be given greater policy space and autonomy.
中国或许会指出自己已经购买了巨额美国国债，从而帮美国撑住了预算赤字（那中国最近抛出美国国债的行动意味着什么？	China may point to the mountain of US Treasury bonds that it has bought up, thereby helping to sustain America’s budget deficit.
国务卿致命的性格弱点是羞怯加傲慢，而蒂勒森的秉性却恰恰是这样的 — — 而他在担任国务卿期间似乎没有一天顺利过。	Diffidence and arrogance is a fatal combination for a secretary of state, yet that is precisely what Tillerson displayed – and he rarely seemed to have a good day in the job.
一个相对美国改变自身货币政策的国家也在极大改变其现行汇率；同时，在当下这个高度全球化的世界上，这意味着极大地扰乱该国自身的进/出口部门。	A country that changes its monetary policy vis-à-vis the US changes its current exchange rate by a lot; and, in today’s highly globalized world, that means that it deranges its import and export sectors substantially.
中国的崛起和美国的相对衰落带给日本的不仅是危险，也是实施真正改革的机会，或许同时也是日本所需要的冲劲。	China’s rise and America’s relative decline present not only a danger for Japan, but also an opportunity – and perhaps the needed momentum boost – for real reform.
由于即使是许多具备金融知识的私房拥有者也会对直接参与衍生品市场望而生畏，所以开发不动产风险管理的下一步将会是创造合适的零售产品。	Because even many financially sophisticated homeowners will find direct participation in derivative markets too daunting, the next stage in the development of real estate risk management will be to create suitable retail products.
在承认相关政策损害自身形象且无助于阻止恐怖行为之前，拆毁涉嫌恐怖分子的房屋一直是以色列政府沿用多年的常规手段。	Israel’s government regularly destroyed the family homes of alleged terrorists for years before acknowledging that the policy was damaging its image – without deterring terrorist acts.
巴厘岛一揽子计划规定WTO成员要朝着降低非关税贸易壁垒方向发展 — — 例如，通过建立更透明的海关法规和减少相关贸易文件。	The Bali package commits WTO members to moving toward lowering non-tariff trade barriers – for example, by establishing more transparent customs regulations and reducing trade-related paperwork.
利用增加债务来维持眼下的消费量，无论是在家庭还是政府部门，都应该被视为一种不可持续的增长模式组成部分。	Increasing debt to sustain current consumption, whether in the household or government sector, is rightly viewed as an unsustainable element of a growth pattern.
执政的国大党领导人索尼亚·甘地主要出于性别原因竭力推动帕蒂尔当选，她称这一选举为“全国妇女的特殊时刻 ” 。	Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the ruling Congress Party, who pushed hard to promote Patil’s candidacy primarily on gender grounds, calls this election “a special moment for women across the country.”
2007年，我参观了“中国人民抗日战争纪念馆 ” ， 这个纪念馆大部分展品所表达的情绪都体现在它的名称当中。	In 2007, I visited the “Museum of the War of Chinese People’s Resistance against Japanese Aggression,” an institution whose name reflects the sentiment expressed by the bulk of its exhibits.
达杨-巴拉克警告“在（加沙）边境的壕沟之外，是无际的憎恨和复仇欲望之海，等待着平静在我们的道路上消退的那一天 。 ”	Dayan-Barak warned that “beyond the furrow of the (Gaza) border, a sea of hatred and desire for revenge is swelling, awaiting the day when serenity will dull our path.”
同样在这些公司中，对“欧洲其他国家”的销售额1997年平均只占其欧洲总销售额的不到30 % ， 而2005年已经上升到超过43 % 。	For these companies, sales to the “rest of Europe,” which represented an average of less than 30% of total European sales in 1997, rose above 43% in 2005.
粮食盈余国家需有能力向缺粮国家供粮，在当前很多地区的粮食生产环境遭到气候变化破坏的情况下，则更是如此。	Surplus countries need to be in a position to supply deficit countries, and all the more so now that climate change is undermining the conditions for food production in many parts of the world.
工党领袖杰里米·科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn）指责新自由主义要为越来越多的人无家可归、儿童陷入贫困以及工资跌落到生存线以下负责。	In the United Kingdom, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn accuses neoliberalism of increasing homelessness, throwing children into poverty, and causing wages to fall below subsistence level.
在这样一个和乌克兰仍然处于交战状态的时刻，决策者、当地居民、流散在外的乌克兰人甚至有些俄国人都会涌上利沃夫街头欣赏世界级的爵士乐。	At a time when Russia and Ukraine are still very much at war, policymakers, local citizens, members of the Ukrainian diaspora, and even some Russians pack the streets of Lviv to celebrate world-class jazz.
而尽管食品加工尚未出现全球规模的整合，但在地区层面上，联合利华、达能、蒙德利兹（Mondelez）和雀巢的公司已经实现了主宰。	And even though food processing is not yet consolidated on a global scale, it is still dominated at the regional level by companies such as Unilever, Danone, Mondelez, and Nestlé.
同时改善平等性和增长的最佳方法是有效发展人力资本，这不但能够支持现在的收入的提高，还能保证未来的代际流动性。	The best way to enhance both equity and growth is effective development of human capital, which not only supports higher incomes today, but also ensures intergenerational mobility tomorrow.
特别是德国必须承认其经济绝不是无辜受害者，而是欧元区最大的受益者 — — 从欧元诞生的那一天起就是如此。	Germany, in particular, must acknowledge that, far from being an innocent victim, its economy is the eurozone’s biggest beneficiary – and has been since the euro’s inception.
美国和中国的境况比其他国家好得多，而这些经济体中的大部分 — — 特别是步履艰难的欧元区国家、日本和一些新兴市场 — — 将不得不寻找全新的经济引擎。	While the US and China are significantly better placed than others, most of these economies – in particular, the struggling eurozone countries, Japan, and some emerging markets – would have to nurture entirely new growth engines.
在2014年中期选举中，智库Demos报道，在收入少于每年30,000美元的家庭中，有68.5%的人没有去投票。	In the 2014 midterm election, the think tank Demos reports, 68.5% of people in households earning less than $30,000 per year didn’t vote.
一些发展中国家领导人也许因为另一个原因而不太高兴：富裕国家提供1,000亿美元融资没有写入协定有法律约束力的部分。	Some developing-country leaders may be displeased for another reason: the figure of $100 billion in finance from rich countries does not appear in the legally binding body of the agreement.
围绕国有旗舰石油公司巴西石油（Petrobras）的腐败丑闻引发了一场经济危机，导致货币跳水，经济增长陷入停滞状态。	The corruption scandal surrounding the flagship state-owned oil company, Petrobras, has produced an economic crisis, with the currency tanking and growth grinding to a halt.
在如此充满着保护主义陷阱的不安的全球经济环境中，世界最大贸易伙伴之间（占全球GDP的约40 % ） 的自由贸易契约至关重要。	In such an economically insecure global environment, riddled with protectionist booby traps, a free-trade pact between the world’s two largest trading blocs, accounting for roughly 40% of global GDP, has never been more important.
但20世纪90年代早期，我逐渐认识到这种方法是不够的，因为它未能考虑到基本实际（即经过通胀调整后的）汇率本身仍有可能波动。	But in the early 1990s, I came to regard this approach as insufficient, because it failed to take into account that the underlying real (inflation-adjusted) exchange rate could itself vary.
统一毫无疑问必须由韩朝人民来决定，但这一目标可以在邻国达成一致的环境下实现，从而确保统一有利于地区内所有各方。	Unification is certainly a matter for the Korean people to decide, but it should be achieved with the support of neighboring countries, ensuring that unification benefits all parties in the region.
据估计，到2016年年底，有1,160万难民正在经历“长期流离失所 ” ： 他们背井离乡已超五年，没有任何能“立即返乡”的希望。	At the end of 2016, there were an estimated 11.6 million refugees experiencing “protracted displacement”: they have been away from their homes for more than five years and have no “immediate prospects” of return.
所需要的改革虽然可以实现，但会考验政府的决心和执行能力，还有公众接受经济当下停滞以换取长期收益的意愿。	The required reforms, though achievable, will test the government’s resolve and implementation capabilities, as well as the population’s willingness to face immediate disruptions in exchange for the promise of longer-term gains.
以色列首席犹太法博士为什么从来没有讨论过和平，更谈不上就上帝眼中的首要问题发表声明，追问究竟是一块土地，还是数百万人的生命更加重要？	Why does the Chief Rabbinate of Israel never discuss peace, much less make a statement on what, in the eyes of God, should have priority: a piece of land or millions of human lives?
在法国，反犹主义来自两个方向：极右翼的国民阵线（National Front）和位数庞大的穆斯林群体的一些派别。	In France, anti-Semitism comes from two directions: the far-right National Front and certain sections of the country’s large Muslim community.
替代方案也许是欧盟和欧亚经济联盟之间的对话，但这一对话绝不容易，因为欧亚经济联盟追求拉近与中国及其丝绸之路盟友的关系。	An alternative might be a dialogue between the EU and the EEU, but that would be tricky as the EEU pursues a closer relationship with China and its Silk Road allies.
自2012年底执政以来，日本首相安倍晋三一直在寻求改善与普京的关系，希望开启关于北方四岛的严肃谈判。	After coming to power at the end of 2012, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had sought to improve relations with Putin in the hope of beginning serious talks on the Northern Territories.
此次选举并不是什么压倒性胜利，而是揉进美国民主眼中的沙子，承诺要让俄国 — — 对不起，是美国 — — “再次伟大 ” 。	This election was not a landslide; it was a little sand blown into the great engine of American democracy by the promise to make Russia – sorry, America – “great again.”
事实上，香港政府目前正在对其他四名立法会议员 — — 均为相对温和的民主活跃分子 — — 采取法律手段，指责他们的就职宣誓也是无效的。	And, in fact, Hong Kong’s government is now launching legal challenges against four more legislators – all relatively moderate pro-democracy activists – arguing that their oaths of office were also invalid.
欧盟日程的命运 — — 不管是容克的日程还是马克龙的日程 — — 都取决于默克尔，而她不可能做出任何重大政治举措。	The fate of any EU agenda – whether Juncker’s or Macron’s – rests with Merkel, who is unlikely to make any significant political moves.
通过为少数族裔提供保护，穆尔西能向其他政府和政治运动证明少数民族权利的重要性，并鼓励他们采取同样的措施。	By protecting minorities, Morsi could demonstrate to other governments and political movements the importance of minority rights and encourage them to behave likewise.
至于南亚，我们希望印度和巴基斯坦关系的缓和能够促进更好的核军备控制，即使中国 — — 它将核弹视为世界地位的一部分 — — 的阴影仍在困扰印度。	As for South Asia, one hopes that a détente between India and Pakistan will facilitate better nuclear-arms control, even if the shadow of China – which sees its bomb as part of its place in the world – will still hang over India.
简言之，将基础设施重新定义为新资产类别是吸引基础设施建设融资、从而提振长期经济增长和就业率的唯一可行的办法。	In short, redefining infrastructure as a new asset class is the only credible way to attract funding for infrastructure construction, and thus to boost long-term economic growth and the employment rate.
他们更有可能主张削减现有的社会福利支出，例如那些令包括儿童在内的占总人口数量2/5的底层民众受益的社会保障和其他计划。	They are more likely to advocate cutting existing social-welfare spending, such as Social Security and other programs that benefit the bottom two-fifths of the population, including children.
但美国成为国际联盟成员国的提案于1919年被参议院否决，这些部队因此留在了国内，而且美国也“恢复了常态 ” 。	But, after the Senate rejected US membership in the League in 1919, the troops stayed home and America “returned to normal.”
多数成功的现代足球俱乐部就像贝纳通广告般纷繁复杂，它们的教练和球员来自世界各地，但这似乎不能对当地支持者的热情产生丝毫影响。	Most successful modern football clubs are as mixed as Benetton advertisements, with coaches and players from all over the globe, but this seems to have done nothing to diminish the enthusiasm of local supporters.
20世纪70年代，直接投资国外的跨国公司（TNC’s）刚刚引起人们注意的时候，很多政府都认为直接外资的代价超过了它的收益，因此采取了控制外资的政策。	During the 1970’s, when the transnational corporations (TNC’s) undertaking such investment caught the public eye, many governments believed that the costs of FDI outweighed its benefits, so they controlled it.
但这不过是个长期战略目标，而不是总统选举应该关注的对象，特别是中国还远未强大到在任何领域对美国构成实质性威胁的时候更是如此。	But that remains a long-term strategic goal, not the stuff of presidential campaigns, especially when China seems too weak to pose any immediate threat to the US on any front in the foreseeable future.
换句话说，日本工薪族在过去十五年里损失了34.3万亿日元 — — 这个数字比丹麦、马来西亚或新加坡的年度GDP还要大。	In other words, Japan’s wage earners have lost ¥34.3 trillion over the last decade and a half – an amount larger than the annual GDP of Denmark, Malaysia, or Singapore.
目前他是受人尊敬的工党的领导人。 科尔宾主义号召用货币融资解决财政赤字（现在称为“人民的量化宽松 ” ） 、产业国有化（从铁路开始）以及结束竞争和私人提供公共服务。	It calls for monetary financing of fiscal deficits (now called “people’s quantitative easing”), nationalization of industry (beginning with the railroads), and an end to competition and the private provision of public services.
对于这种以连通为导向的大战略来说，中东地区至关重要，它是习近平此行在开罗所宣扬的“一带一路”计划的关键。	The Middle East is crucial to this connectivity-oriented grand strategy, not least because of its key role in the “One Belt, One Road” project that Xi promoted in Cairo.
为难民在失去家园的前几年中提供充足的住宿、食物、医疗、教育和就业培训的成本为每人每年3,000-5,000 美元，而目前主要接收国只能获得其中一小部分资金。	As it stands, such countries receive just a fraction of the $3,000-5,000 per refugee required annually to provide adequate housing, food, health care, schooling, and job training during the first few years of displacement.
成为高效的国际机构的成员让这些国家加入了随后的政策讨论，而它们自身的能力让它们能够抓住跨国生产和消费链中的机会。	Membership in effective international institutions brought these countries into consequential global policy discussions, while their own capabilities allowed them to exploit opportunities in cross-border production and consumption chains.
但有四个关键“杠杆”能让住房交付成本下降20—50 % ， 从而让大部分城市收入相当于中位值50—80%的家庭住得起房（住房支出占总收入不超过30 % ） 。	But there are four key “levers” that can reduce the cost of housing delivery by 20-50%, thereby making housing affordable (amounting to no more than 30% of total income) for households earning 50-80% of the median income in most cities.
是的，大部分投资者、监管者、消费者甚至政客将在相当长的时间内铭记金融濒死的体验，因此像2008年剧烈崩盘这样的事件在短期内不会重演。	Yes, the chances of an immediate repeat of the acute financial meltdown of 2008 are much reduced by the fact that most investors, regulators, consumers, and even politicians will remember their financial near-death experience for quite some time.
乌克兰新的教育法律框架就是这么一个例子：该部法律遭到了激烈的反对，但这些声音极少来自国内，而是来自邻近各国。	That is the case with Ukraine’s new framework law on education, which has become the target of harsh opposition not so much from within the country, but rather from some neighboring countries.
Underlying the failure in Copenhagen are some deep problems.	Underlying the failure in Copenhagen are some deep problems.
其次，中国可能陷入所谓的修昔底德陷阱：当一个老牌强国（修昔底德时代的斯巴达，现在的美国）担心崛起的力量（当时的雅典，现在的中国）时，很难避免战争。	Second, China may become ensnared in the so-called Thucydides Trap: when an established power (Sparta in Thucydides’ time; the United States now) fears a rising power (Athens then; China now), war becomes inevitable.
首先，联邦公开市场委员会表示2015年12月的利率增长将是在随后一年内合共五轮利率上升中的第一轮，也是2017年9月之前九轮上升的第一轮。	First, the FOMC indicated that the December 2015 rate increase would be the first of five such increases that it would make within the subsequent year, and the first of nine that would take place by, say, September 2017.
在美国这个例子里，联邦金融的相关准则在南北战争之前还没有被制定出来，而美联储系统则出现得更晚，直到1913年才创建。	In the American case, the principles of federal finance were not worked out until the Civil War, and the Federal Reserve System was established even later, coming only in 1913.
与梅尔泽尔-理查德框架的推论相反，普通美国选民似乎并不十分热衷于提高最高边际税率或提高社会转移支付。	Contrary to the implications of the Meltzer-Richard framework, ordinary American voters do not seem to be very interested in raising top marginal tax rates or in greater social transfers.
英国在讨论是否停止对印度的援助，后者是当今第三大资本流入国，也是英国最大制造业雇主塔塔集团（Tata Group）的母国。	The United Kingdom is debating whether to discontinue aid to India, the third-largest recipient of capital inflows and the home of the UK’s largest manufacturing employer, the Tata Group.
随着大学学费飞涨，让他们的孩子能得到教育 — — 这算是一点点希望之火 — — 的唯一方法是借钱；但是由于教育贷款基本上从来不会被免除，学生负债似乎比其他形式的债务更加恶劣。	With college tuition soaring, the only way their children could get the education that would provide a modicum of hope was to borrow; but, with education loans virtually never dischargeable, student debt seemed even worse than other forms of debt.
美国这一决定反映了两股趋同的力量：一是近期所有美国政府全部表现出在中东寻求霸权的深层次外交政策取向，二是特朗普所特有的心理变态。	The US decision reflects two converging forces: a deep-seated foreign-policy tendency – manifested by all recent US administrations – to seek hegemony in the Middle East, and Trump’s peculiar brand of psychopathy.
一场投票率低下的大选让穆斯林兄弟会夺得了多数，随后该党派独立执政并开始忽略良好治理，疏远除了自身狂热支持者之外的所有人。	A low-turnout election gave a plurality of the popular vote to the Muslim Brotherhood, which came to power alone and proceeded to ignore good governance and alienate all except its most fervent followers.
意大利股价下跌 — — 尤其是作为最佳国家风险测算指标的国内银行股 — — 而针对主权债务违约的保险溢价已经上涨。	And Italian equity prices have fallen – particularly in domestic bank shares, the best proxy of country risk – while insurance premia against a sovereign default have increased.
根据今年早些时候发布的2011年数据，按经PPP调整的GDP衡量，印度目前已是世界第三大经济集体，超过了德国和日本。	According to the figures for 2011, released last year, India is now the world’s third largest economy in terms of PPP-adjusted GDP, ahead of Germany and Japan.
据牛津经济学咨询公司（Oxford Economics）的数据，购买中国进口商品每年可以为美国家庭节省大约8,500亿美元。	According to the consultancy Oxford Economics, buying Chinese imports saves American families around $850 annually.
我强调它们不是为了淡化其他问题 — — 比如美国货币政策、大宗商品价格低迷、债务危机等 — — 在影响明年全球经济方面的重要性。	By highlighting them, I don’t mean to downplay the importance of other issues – US monetary policy, weak commodity prices, debt crises, and the like – that are likely to affect the global economy in the year ahead.
我的前同事、前美国贸易代表希尔斯（Carla Hills）提出了一个可能：成功的TTIP是重启奄奄一息的多哈回合全球自由贸易谈判的重要推动力。	One possibility, suggested by my ex-colleague, former US Trade Representative Carla Hills, is that a successful TTIP would be a major impetus for rekindling the moribund Doha Round of global free-trade talks.
简言之，这是一个意义（meaningfulness）的问题，这个问题的存在驱使着我们，让我们与其他人联系起来，也主宰着我们的生活。	In short, it is a matter of meaningfulness, the presence of which motivates us, connects us to one another, and orders our lives.
纽约—我最近访问了一家印度拉贾斯坦邦坦克区（Tonk District）的“女孩俱乐部 ” — —这是一个安全空间，将青春期女孩集合起来，由训练有素的导师帮助他们构建社交网络、学习生活技能。	NEW YORK – I recently visited a “girls club” – a safe space where adolescent girls come together with trained mentors to build their social networks and learn life skills – in the Tonk District of Rajasthan, India.
因此，财政部的报告是一个好消息，特别是因为，在没有财政部的支持的情况下，众议院很有可能不会推动这一变革。	So the Treasury’s report is good news, especially because, without Treasury support, the House of Representatives may well stop pushing for this change.
大幅依赖外部储蓄（比如经常账户赤字居高不下）似乎结局不是太好 — — 可能导致债务危机和重大增长停滞。	Substantial reliance on external savings (as reflected in persistent high current-account deficits) seems to end badly – in debt crises and major growth setbacks.
在可持续发展目标框架中，性别与健康这两个原本各自独立的问题相互交织，因为性别本身就是健康结果的主要推动力。	In the SDG framework, the separate issues of gender and health are intertwined, because gender itself is a major driver of health outcomes.
如果德国政府带头为建设强大的欧洲联邦而付出努力，那么一百年后，也许根本就不再有作为主权政治单位存在的德国。	If Germany’s new government leads the charge toward a stronger, more federal Europe, a century from now, there may well be no sovereign German political unit at all.
一方面，8月份在弗吉尼亚州夏洛特维尔（Charlottesville）出现了大量本土论者、白人至上主义者和新联盟派（neo-confederates）拧断了不少黑人和犹太人的脖子。	On the one hand, it is to be found in that horde of nativists, white supremacists, and neo-confederates who descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, in August to break some black and Jewish heads.
欧洲政府和银行最终将需要类似于布雷迪债券（Brady bond）的解决方案。 20世纪90年代，布雷迪债券在克服拉丁美洲危机及其对风险敞口高企的美国资金中心银行的威胁中居功至伟。	European governments and banks ultimately will need a solution similar to Brady bonds, which worked quite well in overcoming the 1990s Latin American debt crisis and the threat that it posed to highly exposed US money-center banks.
比如，2016年，流向受脆弱性影响地区的官方发展援助（ODA）总量为682亿美元，其中只有2%被用于冲突预防活动，只有10%被用于缔造和平的计划。	In 2016, for example, just 2% of the $68.2 billion in official development assistance (ODA) that went to places affected by fragility was used for conflict-prevention activities, and only 10% went to peace-building initiatives.
如果42人赞成，罗塞夫将被停职最多180天，在此期间由副总统特梅尔（Michel Temer）代行总统职责。	If 42 agree, she will be suspended for up to 180 days, during which time Vice President Michel Temer will assume the presidency.
去年12月，在经历了两年“慢牛”后，中共喉舌《人民日报》宣布所谓的“改革牛”市的到来将让上证综指远远超过4,000点。	Last December, after two years of a “slow bull” market, People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, announced the arrival of a so-called “reform bull” market that would push the Shanghai Composite Index far above 4,000.
造成这个局面的直接原因是：主要由于2006年针对黎巴嫩真主党的糟糕的战争，以色列总理埃胡德·奥尔默特领导的政府很无力并且不受欢迎。	There are immediate reasons why this is so: Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s government is weak and unpopular, mainly due to the botched 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
不同问题的联盟和运动，如果能够将政府内部人士和外部人士联合起来，形成观点和专业知识的合力，则能够起到最大的效果。	Issue-specific coalitions and campaigns work best when they bring together government insiders and outsiders, to combine perspectives and expertise.
当然，我们也取得了一些成功，比如印度于2014年被认证为已根除脊髓灰质炎，而尼日利亚同年也切断了病毒传播。	To be sure, there have been some successes, such as in India, which was certified polio-free in 2014, and in Nigeria, which interrupted transmission the same year.
但是，德国正逐渐成为另一个含义上的集市经济，因为现在它专门从事包装和销售产品，而将高附加值制造业中越来越多的份额外包给低工资国家。	But Germany is gradually becoming a bazaar economy in a different sense, because nowadays it specializes in packaging and selling its products, while outsourcing an ever-larger share of its high value-added manufacturing to low-wage countries.
但这些批评实际��也反映了这些人对近年来武装冲突本质的错误理解，须知这些冲突已经不能再用传统的战争成败逻辑来评断了。	But these criticisms reflect an inability to contemplate the current nature of armed conflict, which no longer follows the classical logic of military victory or defeat.
但是，对德国人、荷兰人和奥地利人来说，利差不是问题，而是解决方案的一部分，因为利差加强了纪律，并扩张到欧洲机构的新权力之外。	But, for Germans, Dutch, and Austrians, interest-rate spreads are not the problem; they are part of the solution, given that they impose discipline that extends beyond European institutions’ new powers.
在亨廷顿看来，南斯拉夫战争完全符合他的简单模式 — — 一方是以天主教和新教为代表的西方基督教，而信仰其他宗教的欧洲区域则构成了另一方。	For Huntington, the Yugoslav wars fit his simplistic paradigm perfectly, with Western Christianity – Catholicism and Protestantism – on one side, and the rest of Europe’s religions on the other.
幸运的是，把还没有什么（即使连已露端倪的都没有）迹象显示会出现一名极具魅力的领导人，能够将一盘散沙的民族社会主义分子愤愤不平的力量结合起来转化为一个充满仇恨的“民族复兴”团体。	Fortunately, there is no sign yet (not even on the horizon) of a charismatic leader capable of forging the scattered energies of national-socialist grievances into a critical mass of hatred and “national revival.”
正如政府间气候变化专门委员会（Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change）最近的报告所强调的，我们决不能在这方面减慢速度。	As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s most recent report reinforced, we cannot afford a slowdown in progress.
为“减少因森林砍伐和退化所造成的碳排放计划”创造积分市场能够为污染严重的企业和行业创造投资保护热带雨林的机会。	Creating a market for REDD+ credits would create investment opportunities in tropical forest preservation for heavily polluting companies and industries.
涂尔干把这种现象与更具进步意味的“有机团结”进行了对比，后者依托个人的专业和职能关系成为现代社会的主流。	Durkheim contrasts this phenomenon with the more progressive “organic solidarity” that evolves in modern societies according to people’s professional and functional relationships.
在中国，习近平将接替胡锦涛就任国家主席，俄罗斯总理普京则声明自己将从梅德韦杰夫手中重新接过总统宝座。	Xi Jinping is set to replace Hu Jintao as President in China, and, in Russia, Vladimir Putin has announced that he will reclaim the presidency from Dmitri Medvedev.
古钦斯基兄弟想要彻底击毁由政治野心家、后共产主义者、前秘密警察部门官员和犯罪组织组成的腐败体系。 在古钦斯基兄弟看来，这一体系在1989年后一直霸占着波兰政治。	The Kaczynskis want to destroy the “corrupt system composed of careerist politicians, post-communists, former secret service functionaries, and criminal organizations,” who, according to the twins, have ruled Poland since 1989.
现代全球资本主义的悖论之一就是，一方面世界上有超过8亿人食不果腹，另一方面却有大概7亿人（包括1亿儿童）陷入肥胖。	One of the paradoxes of modern global capitalism is that whereas more than 800 million people in the world do not have enough to eat, an estimated 700 million people (including 100 million children) are obese.
事实上，4月29日，阿里巴巴迈出了雄心勃勃的一步，收购了中国Twitter — — 新浪微博18%股权。	Indeed, on April 29, Alibaba signaled its ambitions by buying an 18% stake in Sina Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.
战后全球秩序的明显崩溃 — — 以及对于什么将取而代之的疑问 — — 都对国际合作的有效性埋下了隐忧。	The apparent crumbling of the post-war global order – and the lack of a clear idea as to what will replace it – compounds concerns about the efficacy of international cooperation.
数据被进行经济体间的长期比较，就商业监管的十个方面 — — 比如“破产清算 ” 、 “跨境贸易”等 — — 对185个国家进行排名。	The data are compared across economies and over time to rank 185 countries in ten categories of business regulation, such as “Resolving Insolvency” and “Trading Across Borders.”
美国对巴基斯坦不再完全纵容，这不但有利于南亚安全；也有助于扭转日益恶化的阿富汗安全局势。 美国至今仍未从这场其耗时最久的战事中脱身。	A less permissive US approach toward Pakistan is not only likely to contribute to South Asia’s security; it can also help to reverse deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan, where America remains mired in its longest-ever war.
如今，美国时时刻刻都有约230万年轻人在蹲班房，其中相当数量是因贩卖毒品以解决自己的药瘾而被捕的穷人。	The US now imprisons around 2.3 million people at any time, a substantial number of whom are poor people who are arrested for selling drugs to support their own addiction.
问题的根源是多方面的，其中之一是劳动力市场功能不全，迫使许多哥伦比亚人不得不从事非正式工作或彻底失业。	The problem has many causes, one of which is a poorly functioning labor market that forces many Colombians to accept informal work or no work at all.
你可能认为高效地使用某种事物会降低其使用频率，但事实却恰恰相反。 我们使用某种事物的效率越高，我们的使用频率也就越大。	You might think that learning to use something more efficiently will result in your using less of it, but the opposite is true: the more efficient we get at using something, the more of it we are likely to use.
投资者、管理者和政府官员所想到的风险是货币市场 — — 或者受市场力量冲击的政府管理的货币 — — 常常动能过大，导致基础价值发生过度调整。	The risk on the minds of investors, managers, and government officials is that currency markets – or government-managed currencies buffeted by market forces – often develop too much momentum and overshoot fundamental values.
事实上，在1857年以前，西班牙硬币一直是美国的法定货币，此时距离西班牙失去超级大国地位已经过去了很久。	In fact, Spanish coin remained legal tender in the US until 1857 – long after Spain itself had ceased to be a major power.
Cochrance合作组织，一个提供健康护理信息的国际非赢利性组织，对针灸的功用进行了一次系统的评估。 这项评估包括了14项试验，其中10项试验在中国进行，涵盖了1208位病人。	The Cochrane Collaboration, an international non-profit organization providing healthcare information, conducted a systematic review of the benefits of acupuncture, including 14 trials, of which 10 were conducted in China, involving 1,208 patients.
虽然相对俄罗斯的货币储备这只是一个小数目，但对于该国欠发达的银行体系而言这已属巨额，并由此造成了银行系统的信贷紧缩。	This is a small sum relative to Russia’s currency reserves, but plenty for the underdeveloped banking system, which experienced a severe credit squeeze.
因此，由新的国家货币造成的欧元债资产负债表效应必须通过关于将欧元债务转变为新国家货币债务的有序的协商对话来解决。	The balance-sheet effects on euro debts caused by the depreciation of the new national currency would thus have to be handled through an orderly and negotiated conversion of euro liabilities into the new national currencies.
此外，根据国家外汇管理局的数据，2018年第二季度中国的经常账户和非储备金融账户盈余分别为58亿美元和182亿美元。	Moreover, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China’s current-account and non-reserve financial-account surpluses stood at $5.8 billion and $18.2 billion, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018

齐奥塞斯库和他的夫人，臭名昭著的埃列娜·齐奥塞斯库在人群如潮水般涌入中央委员会时乘坐一架白色直升机从屋顶出逃。	Ceausescu and his wife, the infamous Elena, fled from the roof of the Central Committee aboard a white helicopter as crowds stormed the building.
与此同时，中国共产党领导层选择了另一条道路，通过1989年的天安门大屠杀事件，他们把国家送上了一条与俄罗斯截然不同的道路。	By opting for the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, the Chinese Communist leadership set their country on a road starkly different from the one on which Russia subsequently embarked.
西方国家，尤其是欧盟必须比以往更加明确地谴责埃尔多安朝着专制方向的转变，而不应坐视埃尔多安利用与普京的关系来操纵其北约盟友。	Rather than allow Erdoğan to use his relationship with Putin to manipulate his NATO allies, the West – and the EU, in particular – must condemn, more clearly than ever, his accelerating shift toward autocracy.
"小泉首相似乎已充分意识到这一点，所以正就安全与防卫的问题进行磋商。 磋商的目的是为了修改""国家防卫计划纲要 "" 。"	"Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi seems to grasp much of this, and so is undertaking discussions on security and defense that aim to help revise the ""National Defense Program Outline."""
俄罗斯和中国更有可能缓慢地、逐步地试探它们的实力极限：今天在乌克兰，明天可能在巴尔干半岛；今天在南海岛屿，随后可能是台湾。	Russia and China are more likely to test the limits of their power slowly, bit by bit: Ukraine today, perhaps the Baltics tomorrow; the South China Sea islands now, Taiwan later.
我认为它是开放社会的化身 — — 民族国家为了共同的利益而放弃部分主权，结成任何国家或民族都无法操纵的联盟。	I saw it as the embodiment of an open society – an association of nation-states that gave up part of their sovereignty for the common good and formed a union dominated by no one nation or nationality.
首先，在许多国家拖延推诿以致延误时机之时，总理埃迪·拉玛在2013年9月上台后立即致电国际货币基金组织。	First, as opposed to many countries that delay action until it is too late, Prime Minister Edi Rama called in the IMF as soon as he got into power in September 2013.
新德里—好像为了强调亚洲最大挑战乃是如何应对日渐专横的中国的崛起似的，中国政府披露了在流向他国的大河上建设新大坝的计划。	NEW DELHI – As if to highlight that Asia’s biggest challenge is managing the rise of an increasingly assertive China, the Chinese government has unveiled plans to build large new dams on major rivers flowing to other countries.
一方面，虽然面临重选的共和党参议院席位要比民主党席位多出一倍多，但前者依然手握参议院的控制权，另一方面，共和党只丢失了少数众议院席位，远远低于原本20个的预期。	The party retained control of the Senate, even though more than twice as many Republican seats were up for reelection than Democratic seats, and it lost just a handful of House seats, far fewer than the 20 predicted.
比如，法国总统马克龙的“共和国前进 ” （ La République En Marche ! ） 在春季横扫法国总统和议会选举。	Consider French President Emmanuel Macron’s La République En Marche!, which swept the French presidential and parliamentary elections this past spring.
此前，找到希格斯波色子只不过是一个理论预言。 这个预言需要人类所尝试过的最大、最复杂的科学实验：建立粒子加速器 — — 位于日内瓦的大型强子对撞机（简称LHC ） 。	Finding what was, until then, just a theoretical prediction required one of the largest and most complex scientific undertakings ever attempted: the creation of the particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, near Geneva.
斯坦福大学和纽约大学法学院在最近一份报告中做出结论，2008到2011年实际的巴基斯坦平民伤亡数量在所有无人机受害者中占比可能高达75 % 。	A recent report by the law schools at Stanford University and New York University concludes that, in reality, civilian casualties in Pakistan may have accounted for up to 75% of all UAV victims between 2008 and 2011.
最新的汇丰银行报告指出，近期中国债务的迅速积累主要集中在公司和地方政府层面，整体情况并不像许多人所认为的那样危险。	As a recent HSBC report points out, the reasons for China’s rapid accumulation of debt, which is concentrated in the corporate and local-government sectors, suggest that the situation is not nearly as dangerous as many are making it out to be.
而尽管此后贝克曼就放弃教学工作并把绝大部分注意力都用来宣传亲普京的其他谎言，他协助发起的俄罗斯支持的宣传战仍继续对我的安全感构成威胁。	And, while Bäckman has since left his teaching job and directs most of his attention to spouting other pro-Putin falsehoods, the Russian-backed propaganda war he helped wage continues to affect my sense of security.
但是，欧洲各经济体制之间的差异还没有这么剧烈以至于对启动所有计划中最为艰巨的一项 — — 采取共同货币制 — — 形成一个难以逾越的障碍。	But the differences between Europe’s economies were never so dramatic as to form an insurmountable barrier to embarking upon the most ambitious project of all: adopting a common currency.
美国应更积极地要求摩尔多瓦当局尊重法治，公布所有拘留人员花名册，让他们能接触律师和家人，并确保他们不会受到骚扰。	Amerca should be more energetic in demanding that the Moldovan authorities respect the rule of law, issue a roster of all detained persons, provide them access to lawyers and family members, and guarantee that they are not harassed.
此外，如果罗姆尼的追加减税计划如他承诺那样以收入中性的方式融资，那么发生变化的将只是税收的结构，而税收占GDP总比重不会改变。	Moreover, if all of Romney’s additional tax cuts were financed in a revenue-neutral way, as he promises, only the composition of taxes would change; the overall tax share of GDP would not.
尽管优步和亚马逊以及 — — 更加基本地 — — 机器人带来了更多便利，但这是以工作阶级岗位被取代和/或工资降低为代价的。	Even as the likes of Uber and Amazon, and, more fundamentally, robotics, add convenience, they do so by displacing working-class jobs and/or driving down wages.
如果特朗普根据让他赢得大选的竞选纲领治国，那么可以预期美国和全世界将爆发市场恐慌，甚至有可能引起重大经济损失。	If Trump governs in accordance with the campaign that got him elected, we can expect market scares in the United States and around the world, as well as potentially significant economic damage.
要获取一次军事行动的胜利，鲍威尔列出了四个必须满足的条件：一是压倒性的兵力部署，这是墨西哥军队所没有的。	Powell enumerated four conditions that must be satisfied in order to succeed in a military operation. One was deployment of overwhelming force, which the Mexican military lacks.
对于各界广泛认为已经近乎实现充分就业神迹的美国经济来说，这简直是当头一盆冷水 — — 而最尴尬的莫过于已尽一切努力要使通胀水平回归2％目标值的美联储了。	For a US economy that is widely presumed to be nearing the hallowed ground of full employment, this comes as a rude awakening – particularly for the Federal Reserve, which has pulled out all the stops to get inflation back to its 2% target.
当然，暂时性的动荡、全球收支失衡恶化以及宏观经济政策失误（包括哪些源自发达经济体但影响到全世界经济的失误）可能会破坏全球增长。	Of course, temporary disturbances, a worsening of global payments imbalances, or macroeconomic policy mistakes, including those made in advanced economies and affecting the entire world economy, could undermine global growth.
执行规章制度的咨询过程是高度结构化的，而其中大部分工作都集中如何确保金融服务的提供者和用户的利益都能平等地体现出来。	The consultation processes on rules and regulations were highly structured, and much effort was devoted to ensuring balanced representations from providers and users of financial services.
典型的例子是美国电话电报公司（AT&T）及其旗下的贝尔实验室，这是乔·格尼特在其2012年的著作理念工厂中精心讲述的一个故事。	A paradigmatic example is the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and its Bell Labs, a story meticulously recounted by Jon Gertner in his 2012 book The Idea Factory.
很明显，防止伊拉克和阿富汗监狱疟俘事件所需的制衡力量并不存在，而布什政府创造的氛围就算不是不可避免，也更利于疟俘事件的发生。	It is clear that the checks needed to prevent abuse in the Iraqi and Afghan prisons were not in place, and that the Bush Administration had created a climate that made such abuses more likely, if not inevitable.
10年后，越南共产党的领导人也同样得出了马克思列宁主义将令经济走入死胡同的结论，并决心踏上邓小平当年走过的市场化改革之路。	Ten years later, Vietnam’s Communist rulers also concluded that Marxism-Leninism was an economic dead end, and decided to start down the same path of market reform that Deng had taken.
能避免造成五个人死亡的唯一办法就是加入一个道岔，将电车引导到旁边的轨道，如此一来它就只会撞死一个人。	The only thing you can do to prevent these five deaths is to throw a switch that will divert the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill only one person.
这套制度不啻背叛的请帖，而特朗普和桑德斯 — — 他们分别依靠自有资金和草根“众筹 ” — —是理想的叛逆领袖。	That system invited rebellion, and Trump and Sanders – by self-financing and grassroots fundraising, respectively – were ideally positioned to lead one.
美国研究社区意识衰落问题的泰斗罗伯特·普特南发现，电视节目是导致“社会资本 ” — —即维持社区凝聚的信任 — — 衰减的核心因素。	Robert Putnam, the leading scholar of America’s declining sense of community, has found that TV viewing is the central explanation of the decline of “social capital,” the trust that binds communities together.
经济评论家马丁·沃尔夫（Martin Wolf）指出 ： “ 财政挑战是长期性的，不是一夜之间就能解决的 。 ”	As the economics commentator Martin Wolf has noted, “The fiscal challenge is long term, not immediate.”
人民对这些事件爆发了发自肺腑的愤怒，先前默默无闻的反复活动家，如阿纳·哈扎尔（Anna Hazare）发动了数以千计的印度人在全国开展机会运动，向政府腐败示威。	The population’s outraged response to these events was visceral, and previously unknown figures such as the anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare rallied thousands of Indians in meetings across the country to protest against government corruption.
俄罗斯经济的衰弱性及其本国银行和公司的高杠杆性被近些年来虚高的油价和天然气价格所掩盖。 但在本期全球经济大动荡中暴露无遗。	Even with the modest recovery in commodity prices over the past six months, Russia’s energy sector has experienced declining production in recent years, due in part to fears among foreign investors of expropriation.
这或许会令当今的人们感到震惊，但这种道德沦丧必须追溯到无孔不入的“许可证统治 ” — —任何进口，生产以及投资行为都需要许可证，而且情况不断恶化。	If that seems shocking today, the loss of virtue must be traced to the all-pervasive “permit raj,” with its licensing requirements to import, produce, and invest, which grew to gargantuan proportions.
两个国家 — — 伊拉克和利比亚 — — “被”停止开发核武器，而如今的伊朗（它也是条约的签约国）承诺遵守对其核项目的重要限制。	Two states – Iraq and Libya – were stopped from developing nuclear weapons, and now Iran, a party to the treaty, has committed to abide by important restrictions on its nuclear program.
美国前总体比尔·克林顿称之为“发展援助的民主化 ” ， 意思是个人不仅通过本国政府提供援助，自己也亲自参与其中。	Former US President Bill Clinton called this response a “democratization of development assistance,” in which individuals lend their help not only through their governments but also through their own efforts.
与此同时，水产养殖业需要进一步投资和开发创新，以实现可持续道路 — — 不管这条路在陆上还是在海上。	In the meantime, the aquaculture industry will need to make further investments and develop new innovations to put itself on a path to sustainability – be it on land or in the sea.
二者似乎都是真正的经济民族主义者：特朗普希望美国在钢铝方面实现自给自足，而奥夫拉多尔则力争在玉米、小麦、牛肉、猪肉和木材等领域为墨西哥实现相同的目标。	Both appear to be sincere economic nationalists: Trump hopes to make the US self-sufficient in aluminum and steel, while AMLO seeks the same for Mexico in corn, wheat, beef, pork, and lumber.
那一事件生动的形象进入人们的头脑。 加油站排队的汽车长龙，人们骑车上班，星期天停止供应天然气以及其他配给措施。	Vivid images have stuck in people’s minds from that episode: long lines of cars at gas stations, people riding bicycles to work, gasless Sundays and other rationing schemes.
由牛津大学经济学家、前英格兰银行首席经济学家约翰·威克斯（John Vickers）爵士牵头的委员会想将银行的零售业务与风险更大的交易和投资银行业务“隔离 ” （ ring-fence ） 。	A commission headed by Sir John Vickers, the Oxford economist and former Bank of England chief economist, wants banks’ retail operations to be “ring-fenced” from riskier trading and investment banking businesses.
NTC还面临柏柏尔人（Berber）的压力。 柏柏尔人占利比亚总人口数的10 % ， 且已经组织起来走上街头谴责新签订的政治协定，拒绝接受任何与其文化和语言不相容的制度。	The NTC also faces pressure from Libya’s Berbers, who comprise 10% of the population and have already taken to the streets to denounce the new political arrangements and to reject any system that does not accommodate theirculture andlanguage.
"一些著名民族主义分子，包括电影导演Nikita Mikhalkov，艺术家Ilya Glazunov，作家Valentin Rasputin和Vasily Belov也参与进来，将这次展览称做""新一轮有意的恶魔崇拜 。 """	"A group of well-known nationalist intellectuals, including film director Nikita Mikhalkov, artist Ilya Glazunov, and writers Valentin Rasputin and Vasily Belov, weighed in with a petition calling the exhibition a ""new stage of conscious Satanism."""
要想确信硬币没有不为人知的功能，的确是普通硬币，你就必须记录足够数量的抛掷结果，并检验长期结果数据中正面和背面的出现是否等量。	To know with confidence that the coin is ordinary, with no hidden features, one must log a sufficiently large number of coin flips and check whether the data include equal numbers of heads and tails over the long run.
卡尔森利用科学发现，同时又表达对消费资本主义的根本性担忧以及对生活质量超越经济增长前提的“后物质主义”的信念。	Carson drew on scientific findings, but also voiced fundamental misgivings about consumer capitalism and a “postmaterialistic” belief in the primacy of the quality of life over economic growth.
担任过美国财政部长的哈佛大学校长萨莫斯曾把单一欧洲货币称为欧洲需要面对的真正供应改革的“干扰因素 ” 。	Larry Summers, the former US Treasury Secretary and now president of Harvard University, once called the single European currency a “distraction” from the serious supply-side reforms Europe needed to confront.
也许答案在于美国或拉美式制度，由直接选举产生的首席执行官 — — 总统负责国家级事务，并由州长负责州级事务 — — 在固定任期内履行国家元首和政府首脑的双重职责。	Perhaps the answer lies in the US or Latin American model, with a directly elected chief executive – a president, at the national level, and a governor, at the state level – serving a fixed term as both head of state and head of government.
许多地区重新涌现的爱国主义 — — 对全球化所产生的不公平和错位的反应 — — 必须与人类团结、尊重多样化以及跨境工作能力相协调。	The renewed patriotism seen in many places – a response to the unfairness and dislocation that globalization can generate – must be reconciled with human solidarity, respect for diversity, and the ability to work across national borders.
要达到这样的效果，日本决策者必须专注于更加可持续的增长，同时避免陷入与贸易伙伴国竞相贬值和保护主义的恶性循环。	Doing so requires Japanese policymakers to focus on more sustainable growth while averting a vicious cycle of competitive devaluation and protectionism with Japan’s trade partners.
要不了多久，通胀就将成为央行所面临的问题中最微不足道的哪一个，因为商品、劳务、房地产和大宗商品市场的新一轮不景气将形成通缩压力。	Inflation will soon be the last problem that central banks will fear, as renewed slack in goods, labor, real estate, and commodity markets feeds disinflationary pressures.
举例来说，20世纪90年代波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那的战后就业政策在减少地区严重不平衡和歧视方面并未发挥多大作用。	For example, employment policies did little to reduce the strong regional imbalances and discrimination within regions that persisted in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the war there in the 1990s.
3月初 — — 也就是收购完成不到三个月 — — 默克宣布将关闭丘比斯特早期研究团队，裁员120人，也许还要削减新药开发的投入。	In early March – less than three months after the acquisition – Merck announced it would close down Cubist’s early-stage research unit, laying off some 120 staff and perhaps crippling its efforts to introduce new drugs into the pipeline.
当企业遭遇需求减少并在一段时期内停止雇用员工，有些原本会服务于老牌企业的人利用自身的资源来构思新的产品或经营手段，并建立初创公司来将其付诸实施。	When firms hit by reduced demand stop hiring for a time, some people who would have joined established firms use their situation to dream up new products or methods and organize startups to develop them.
这些事宜将由一位不参加六月份选举的人物来决定，然而他的权力坚不可摧：他就是阿亚图拉·哈梅内伊，伊朗的最高领袖。	These issues will be decided by a man who is not running for office in June, but whose power is secure: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader.
在叙利亚问题上缺乏国际共识，这体现在联合国安理会常任理事国迟迟无法就如何应对形成一致上，它导致了局势不断恶化。	The lack of international consensus on Syria, reflected in the failure of the United Nations Security Council’s permanent players to agree on a way forward, has caused the situation on the ground to worsen.
诚然，美国正受到经济不平等加剧，地区和城乡收入差距扩大，就业职位流失，社会流动性下降以及政治两极分化的困扰。	To be sure, the US is plagued by rising economic inequality, regional and rural-urban income disparities, job insecurity, declining social mobility, and political polarization.
就在上个月，碳披露计划（Carbon Disclosure Project）指出，全世界制定了内部碳定价机制计划的公司数量已经达到了近1,400家，而2014年只有150家。	Just last month, the Carbon Disclosure Project revealed that the number of companies with plans to pursue internal carbon price mechanisms has grown to almost 1,400 globally, up from 150 in 2014.
同等重要的是，如果欧盟没有支持建立自由的行政和社会基础设施，波兰、匈牙利和其他地方就会出现更为严重的共产主义甚至是法西斯主义的强烈反应。	Equally important, had the EU not supported the creation of an administrative and social infrastructure of liberty, there might well have been a more serious communist or even fascist backlash in Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere.
第一个解释是凯恩斯的需求不足论，认为当社会缺钱购买工人所生产的商品和服务时，他们就会“非自愿地”失业。	The first was the Keynesian theory of deficient demand, which holds that workers become unemployed “involuntarily” when their community lacks the money to buy the goods and services they produce.
他们批评可怕的露天矿和有毒的尾矿池，这些东西即使是营销巨星再世也无法“漂绿 ” 。 虽然规模前所未有，但露天矿和尾矿池在常规采矿作业中却是随处可见。	They disparage hideous strip mines and toxic tailing ponds that even superstar marketers cannot “greenwash.” The scale is unusual, but open-pit mines and tailing ponds are normal mining operations everywhere.
中国、日本、韩国以及现在的印度的新领导层都是政治民族主义者，该地区的领土纠纷依然严重，由来已久的历史恩怨也愈演愈烈。	New leaders in China, Japan, South Korea, and now India are political nationalists in regions where territorial disputes remain serious and long-held historical grievances fester.
土耳其在修改宪法方面“经验”丰富，因此，大部分法律专家认为这次选民们以微弱多数支持的修宪绝对是一次倒退。	Given Turkey’s considerable experience in writing constitutions, most legal experts deem the amendments, which voters endorsed by a razor-thin margin, regressive at best.
大部分全球贫困问题讨论的参与者 — — 包括这篇评论的读者 — — 很少或根本不认识生活在贫困线以下的人，这正是世界经济分裂程度的一个写照。	The fact that most participants in discussions about global poverty – the readers of this commentary included – know few, if any, people who live below the poverty line is an indication of the extent of the world’s economic segregation.
但由于缺乏生机勃勃的地方新闻报道，我们常常无法得知这些活动，只有少数记者和研究人员愿意四处走访以记录正在发生的事情。	But in the absence of robust local journalism, we often don’t hear about these activities, other than from the few reporters and researchers who have been willing to traverse the country to document what is happening.
比如最近被孟山都公司收购的气候公司（Climate Corporation）拥有30多年的天气数据、60年的农作物产量数据兆兆字节计的土壤类型信息数据。	For example, the Climate Corporation, recently acquired by Monsanto, combines more than 30 years of weather data, 60 years of crop-yield data, and multiple terabytes of information on soil types.
接着，传染爆发，日益厌恶风险的投资者，特别是来自发达国家市场的短期投资者，开始从其他国家撤出资金填补在危机发生国所产生的损失。	Then, contagion sets in, as increasingly risk-averse investors, particularly short-term investors from developed-country markets, begin to withdraw funds from other countries to cover losses they incurred in the economies where the crises originated.
类似的观点自2008年加沙战争之后就不断在哈马斯领导人嘴边出现，因为他们不想挑起另一次以色列袭击，进而削弱组织的在加沙的统治地位。	This follows from Hamas leaders’ frequent statements since the 2008 Gaza war that they do not want to provoke another Israeli attack, which could cost them their governing position.
现今的改革者们正仔细审查这些传统的思想架构，并试图将伊斯兰的核心伦理原则从已被保守派门奉为圣训的不同历史改写中分离出来。	Today's reformists are subjecting these traditional frameworks to scrutiny and attempting to separate the core ethical principles of Islam from the various historical adaptations that conservatives have enshrined as sacred.
这听起来很可怕，而法国就是这样：不但处于一场危机之中，而且已经到达伟大的反纳粹历史学家马克·布洛赫（Marc Bloch）在1940年时所说的令他的国家“奇怪地败北”的危机的最后阶段。	Frightening as it sounds, that is where France finds itself: not in a mere crisis, but in the last stages of what the great anti-Nazi historian Marc Bloch called, in 1940, his nation’s “strange defeat.”
造成这一监管失败的原因很多，包括无法获取并查验所有相关数据，在实施更严格监管方面所遇到的政治阻挠，以及用模型评估尾部风险方面的困难。	There are several reasons for this regulatory failure, including the inability to acquire and process all relevant data, the political difficulty of enforcing strict judgments, and the difficulty of modeling tail risks.
匈牙利总理维克多·奥尔班（Viktor Orbán）不仅公开宣称自己倾向于实现“非自由”民主制度；还努力破除对他政府权力的制衡。	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has not only openly stated his preference for an “illiberal” democracy; he has worked to dismantle checks on his government’s power.
大部分经济学家认为，特朗普聚焦于双边贸易赤字是错误的，但很多人支持他关于中国挑战美国技术领先地位的抱怨。	While most economists argue that Trump is mistaken to focus on the bilateral trade deficit, many support his complaints about China’s efforts to challenge America’s technological advantage.
托马斯·皮凯蒂（Thomas Piketty）的马克思主义论断 — — 资本主义正在失败，因为不平等性正在增加 — — 背景正在于此。	Thomas Piketty’s Marxian claim that capitalism is failing because domestic inequality is rising has it exactly backwards.
麦肯锡估算，到2020年，大数据分析学可以为零售和制造部门增加3250亿美元或相当于年GDP的1%的产值，同时为医疗部门和政府带来2850亿美元的生产率提高和成本节约好处。	McKinsey estimates that big-data analytics could add about $325 billion, or 1.7% to annual GDP in the retail and manufacturing sectors, while generating up to $285 billion in productivity gains and cost savings in health care and government by 2020.
说新兴市场发生危机还为时过早，但欧洲经验提出了棘手的问题 — — IMF对欧洲国家是否存在双重标准（即使是对希腊这样的事实上的新兴市场国家 ） 。	That is a topic for another day, but the European experience has raised tough questions about whether the IMF has a double standard for European countries (even those, like Greece, that are really emerging markets).
这篇教义呼应并肯定了很多宗教中都能找到的实例，呼吁我们更善良、更明智地利用我们的星球，为一切生物说话。	This message echoes and affirms examples found in the doctrines of many faiths, which call on us to be kinder and wiser in how we use this planet, and to advocate for all creatures.
现在的问题已经不是脸书是否应该通过用户的个人数据获利，而是应该要求向用户支付数据使用费，甚至是客户必须支付一笔费用才能选择不被收集数据。	The question is no longer whether Facebook should monetize users’ personal data, but whether it should be required to pay users for their data or even charge users a fee to opt out of data collection.
当局还承诺到2020年要提高研发支出至GDP的2.5 % ， 每10,000人申请专利量要接近翻番。	It also committed to increasing its expenditure on research and development to 2.5% of GDP and almost doubling the number of patents filed per 10,000 people by 2020.
通过这一举措，美国及其盟友向可能会反对美国政策的任何人释放出清晰的信号：最好不要使用美元和美元银行账户。	With this approach, the US and its allies are sending a clear message to anyone who may disagree with US policy: avoid using the dollar and dollar-denominated bank accounts.
许多发展中国家缺少使用复杂数据收集工具所需要的资金、基础设施和训练；但这并不意味着它们不能在数据收集方面取得重大进步。	Many developing countries lack the funds, infrastructure, and training needed to use sophisticated data-collection tools; but that doesn’t mean they can’t make significant improvements in data collection.
但不管这些批评是否中肯，我们大体可以确定的是纽约市糖尿病登记制度虽然极富创新性，却只是一个最佳的过渡方案。	While these criticisms may or may not be justified, it is probably true to say that the New York City diabetes registry, though highly innovative, is at best an interim solution.
《人猿星球》中的邪恶现实主义（sinister realism）大多来自布尔对当时的动物行为研究的科学细节和知识的细致关注。	Much of the sinister realism in Planet of the Apes stems from Boulle’s impressive attention to scientific detail and knowledge of research into animal behavior at that time.
他们最近发现了他们的阿拉伯同事们长久以来所知道的事情，那就是，购买知识要比生产知识要便宜而且更加安全。	They recently discovered what their Arab colleagues have known for a long time: that for an oil-rich regime, it is cheaper and safer to buy knowledge than to produce it.
西印度人开始大批移民英国以来已经三代人了，但是祖先是加勒比国家的英国人依旧怀疑他们的孩子或者孙辈将会被完全视为英国人。	Three generations after West Indians began immigrating en masse to the United Kingdom, Caribbean-descended Britons still doubt that their children or grandchildren will ever be seen as fully British.
但人们也不应认为民主国家里的政治争论就总是建筑在理性之上的，或者想当然地认为民主制度必然会令人民变得更加理性。	But no one should think that debate in democracies is always based on reason, or that democracy necessarily makes people more rational.
而这个任务又是埃及领导人无可回避的，因为穆巴拉克时代的社会契约 — — 埃及人用自由换取不断扩张的福利国家和慷慨的补助 — — 已难以为继。	And it is a task that Egypt’s leaders cannot avoid, because the social contract of the Mubarak years, whereby Egyptians traded freedom for an expansive welfare state and generous subsidies, is no longer sustainable.
而他们两人的批评与富兰克林·罗斯福总统增加最高法院法官人数、加塞支持他的经济计划的法官的做法相比也都算不上“对民主的威胁 ” 。	And neither amounted to a “threat to democracy” when compared to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s proposal to pack the Supreme Court with additional justices who would uphold his economic program.
里根的幕僚长詹姆斯·贝克尔（James Baker）没有理会他的警告，而是说服政府的其他成员继续推进原计划，这样，他们就不需要承认里根的标志性减税计划是一个错误。	Rather than heed his warnings, Reagan’s chief of staff, James Baker, convinced others in the administration to stay the course, so that they would not have to admit that the president’s signature tax-cutting initiative had been a mistake.
相反，人们认为“法国退欧”和“意大利退欧”的可能性分别为8%和14 % ， 远高于这个十年的前半段欧元危机高峰时期的水平。	By contrast, the perceived likelihood of “Frexit” and “Italexit” are at 8% and 14%, both much higher than even at the peak of the eurozone crisis earlier in the decade.
帕罗奥图—二战结束以来，美元一直是全球贸易的记账货币、银行间国际收支的清算媒介，也是最主要的正式外汇储备货币。	PALO ALTO – Since World War II’s end, the US dollar has been used to invoice most global trade, serving as the intermediary currency for clearing international payments among banks and dominating official foreign-exchange reserves.
"但是""先发制人""的战争战略已经失去了往日的光泽。 我始终期望美国的国会和民众已经从中吸取了惨痛的教训。"	But the doctrine of preemptive war has been badly tarnished, and I remain hopeful that Congress and the American people have learned a painful lesson.
对这些国家的竞争力而言，欧元近期的剧烈升值不啻是雪上加霜，进一步削弱了它们的经济增长，扩大了它们的财政缺口。	The euro’s recent sharp rise has made this competitiveness problem even more severe, reducing growth further and making fiscal imbalances even larger.
如果贝京极端民族主义的伊尔贡（利库德集团的前身）在1947年与本古里安的以色列工人党结盟的话，那么犹太复国主义者就会拒绝将巴勒斯坦分裂开来，而本古里安就不会被允许在1948年5月宣布成立这个犹太国家。	If Menachem Begin’s ultra-nationalist Irgun had joined a coalition with Ben-Gurion’s pragmatic Mapai in 1947, Zionists would have rejected the partition of Palestine, and Ben-Gurion would not have been allowed to declare the Jewish state in May 1948.
那些由掌管全国“肃清阿拉伯复兴社会党影响 ” （ de-Baathification ）进程，同时也是伊朗的伊拉克代理人的人究竟想传达什么样的信息，堪称路人皆知了。	The message from Iran’s allies in Iraq, who control the de-Baathification process, is clear.
皮涅拉的领先和Enríquez-Ominami的崛起或许是同一现象的不同表现：那就是来自基督教民主社会联盟内部，以及民众对于基督教民主社会联盟的厌倦。	Piñera’s lead and the emergence of Enríquez-Ominami are probably expressions of the same phenomenon: fatigue with – and within – the Concertación .
除了有工作的贫困人口之外，全世界还有2.15亿工人在2008—2009年间因为大衰退而被打到了贫困线之下。	Aside from the working poor, an additional 215 million workers worldwide slipped below the poverty line in 2008-2009, owing to the Great Recession.
反过来，如果它限制支出，只是简单地跟随或参照其他企业的研发活动，那么它也可以活得很好，甚至比以前更加滋润。	If, instead, it withheld spending, and simply copied or worked around others’ R&D, it could survive perfectly well – and might be better off.
不过，或许是美国最重要的新年解决方案应该是回归到全球领导地位 — — 这在过去十年中已经被逐步腐蚀，具并产生了破坏性后果。	But perhaps America’s most important New Year’s resolution should be to return to global leadership – a role that has gradually eroded over the last decade, with devastating consequences.
所谓的“特殊关系”在近几年中大大弱化，国会在12月之前一直拒绝支持军事干预叙利亚令这一关系雪上加霜。	The so-called “special relationship” has already become considerably less so in recent years, with Parliament’s refusal until December to support military action in Syria taking a particularly heavy toll in this regard.
印度和印尼也同样如此，但他们从那以后就开始朝正确的方向前进（这在很大程度上应该感谢新一届政府的努力 ） 。	India and Indonesia were on this list as well, though they have begun to move in the right direction since then (thanks in part to new governments).
最后，相信你愿意相信的 — — 即使这意味着信任俄罗斯总统、前克格勃特工普京而不是美国自己的安全和情报机构。	Finally, believe whom you want to believe – even if that means trusting Russian President Vladimir Putin, the ex-KGB man, over America’s own security and intelligence agencies.
但这样想却忘记了过去爆发的进步起义，包括2005年在贝鲁特、2009年在阿尔及尔和德黑兰以及2011年在突尼斯首先爆发并迅速蔓延至整个地区的阿拉伯春天革命。	But to think that is to forget past progressive uprisings, such as in Beirut in 2005, Algiers and Tehran in 2009, and the Arab Spring that began in Tunisia and spread throughout the region in 2011.
自从2005年底以来，欧洲利率上升了200个基点，欧元将近历史最高点。 在这一情况下，萨尔科奇想要让欧洲央行现在停止提高利率。	With European interest rates up 200 basis points since late 2005 and the euro near a record high, Sarkozy wants the ECB to stop raising rates now.
一个多世纪前，朝鲜活动家安重根在中国的哈尔滨火车站刺杀了日本首相伊藤博文。 在韩国，安重根是民族英雄，而在日本，他是恐怖分子。	More than a century ago, the Korean activist Ahn Jung-geun assassinated Japan’s first prime minister, Hirobumi Ito, at the railway station in the Chinese city of Harbin, cementing Ahn’s status as a hero in Korea and a terrorist in Japan.
因此，作为一个总统候选人，当麦凯恩说，如果他当选，他将寻求与民主党人和独立党派人士的合作并寻求共识，人们当时很容易相信他的话，毕竟，这正是他作为一个参议员的一贯的作风。	So when, as a presidential candidate, McCain said that, if elected, he would seek to work with Democrats and independents, and that he would search for consensus, it was easy to believe him. After all, this is exactly how he had behaved as a senator.
一份帝国的遗产 — — 对俄罗斯国家分裂的恐惧 — — 从未远离统治者的脑海，也成为了民主政治发展的主要障碍。	Fear of the Russian state’s disintegration, a legacy of empire, is never far from its rulers’ thoughts. It is the principal barrier to the development of democratic politics.
因此，40—50%GDP幅度的债务增幅将令西欧部分国家长期经济增长率腰斩，令美国长期增长率下降三分之一，将对整整一代人的生活标准带来严重打击。	Thus, increases of 40-50% of GDP risk cutting long-run growth in half in parts of Western Europe, and by one-third in America – a devastating reduction in gains in living standards over the course of a generation.
已故的诺贝尔经济学奖获得者艾丽诺尔·奥斯特罗姆（Elinor Ostrom）指出，人类社会创造了无数创新而持久办法解决包括公共资源使用在内的各种困境。	The late Elinor Ostrom, a Nobel laureate in economics, showed that human societies have built myriad creative and lasting solutions to resolve a wide range of dilemmas involving the use of common resources.
这意味着与2008年几乎让美国银行系统陷入万劫不复的雷曼兄弟倒闭事件相比，眼下的危机给亚洲带来的风险要大得多。	That means that Asia is far more exposed to an offshore banking crisis today than it was in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ collapse in 2008, which led to a near-meltdown of the US banking system.
一位阿根廷朋友解释说，试图提供准确的通胀衡量手段的统计学家都会被政府炒鱿鱼，替之以能炮制低通胀数字的政治盟友。	As one Argentine friend explained, the government fired the statisticians who had tried to provide accurate measures of inflation and replaced them with political allies who would produce artificially low numbers.
虽然美国已经和伊拉克签署了在2011年前撤军的协定，但五角大楼有消息称美国“非战斗性”部队会继续驻扎在该国几年或几十年。	While the US has signed an agreement with Iraq to leave by the end of 2011, there is talk in the Pentagon that US “non-combat” troops will remain in the country for years or decades to come.
但如果你做得真的非常好 — — 比如抄底买入廉价资产，或扩张了市场份额 — — 那么认为你不太可能支持谨慎也是应有之义。	But if someone did really well – by buying assets on the cheap at the bottom of the cycle, for example, or expanding market share – it seems reasonable to suppose that they are less likely to favor caution.
在阿根廷，总统马克里将庇隆主义的民粹主义者基什内尔扫地出门，尽管发生了不可避免的经济调整和低增长，他仍能保持非常高的支持率。	In Argentina, President Mauricio Macri, who ousted the Peronist-populist Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, remains popular despite an inevitable economic adjustment and slow growth.
在中国市场，另外一个重要的发展趋势则是“线上线下融合（OMO ） ” — — 这也是除人工智能之外，创新工场另一个重点投资的方向。	Another important developing trend in China is “online merging with offline” (OMO) – a trend that, along with AI, Sinovation Ventures is betting on.
7月以来，公平审判和记者无国界组织（RSF）已对一系列以国际刑警组织信息为依据逮捕和拘留记者的案件采取了措施。	Since July, Fair Trials and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have responded to a number of cases in which reporters have been arrested and detained on the basis of Interpol information.
印度超越宪法的非政府组织（NGO）所绑架，这些NGO聚集在国家顾问委员会（National Advisory Council，NAC）的名义下，并以甘地为首脑。	India has been taken hostage by an extra-constitutional body composed of NGOs, brought together under the National Advisory Council, which is chaired by Gandhi.
如果经济衰退延长，并且美国人继续错误地将不断上升的失业率，工资下降以及不平等加剧归咎于贸易协议，那么，反对这些协议的力量就会增强。	If recession drags on and Americans continue to blame trade agreements – erroneously – for growing unemployment, falling wages, and yawning inequality, opposition to these deals will grow.
因此，在宣布最新制裁措施时，欧洲人只是对现有制裁清单略作扩大 — — 主要针对军方和政治官员，而美国走得更远，把几家俄罗斯机构也囊括其中。	That is why, when the latest sanctions were announced, the Europeans issued a modest expansion of their existing list – primarily focusing on military and political officials – while the US went further, adding several Russian institutions.
当前许多发达国家建立电子病案的行动将直接改进医疗卫生状况，此外还能大大提高信息流动性，从而为基因和其他医学研究提供帮助。	The current movement in many developed countries towards electronic medical records will improve health care directly, but it will also lead to much improved information liquidity to help genetic and other medical research.
坎布里奇—预计美国总统特朗普将在11月2日宣布其所选择的替耶伦（Janet Yellen）的继任者，他将在经过参议院批准后，从2018年2月起上任。	CAMBRIDGE – US President Donald Trump’s administration is expected, by November 2, to announce its choice, subject to Senate approval, to succeed Janet Yellen as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board in February 2018.
这一令人信服的观点由阿提夫·米安（Atif Mian）和埃米尔·苏菲（Amir Sufi）在《债务屋 》 （ House of Debt）中提出。	That argument is persuasively made by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi in House of Debt, an important new book that analyzes US data on a county-by-county basis.
在这种情况下，你给最贫穷的那一半人口多少钱并不重要：疫苗的价格会持续上涨到只有最富有的那一半人能够负担得起的点位。	In this scenario, it wouldn’t matter how much money you give to the poorest half of the population: the price of the drug would keep rising to the point where only the wealthiest half the population could afford it.
该行动计划和默克尔的访问在土耳其国内被视为事实上支持埃尔多安；欧盟甚至将公布对土耳其入盟谈判的一篇批评性“进展报告”推迟到土耳其选举投票之后。	The action plan and Merkel’s visit were viewed within Turkey as de facto endorsements of Erdoğan; the EU even delayed the release of a critical “progress report” on Turkey’s accession negotiations until after the vote.
问参议院多数党领袖这样的问题没有什么不合理的 ： “ 如果你认为现在时机还不成熟，那么你认为合适的时机又是什么？	It would not have been unreasonable to ask the Senate majority leader: “If you think it is premature now, then when do you think the right time will be?
毫无疑问，乌克兰家庭正享受着不可理喻的巨额能源补贴 — — 总额相当于2012年该国GDP的7.5 % ， 也应当摆脱对此的依赖。	It is true that Ukrainian households need to be weaned off absurdly large energy subsidies, which amounted to 7.5% of GDP in 2012.
当然还有国际货币基金组织，该组织工作人员告诉所有愿意倾听者希腊债务必须削减三分之一，或者1万亿欧元（合1.12万亿美元）的总额。	Of course, there is the IMF, whose staff tell anyone willing to listen that Greek debt must be cut by approximately one-third, or €100 billion ($112 billion).
墨西哥在含糖饮料方面的消费量在1993~2014年间几乎增长了两倍，而自那以后的一项针对含糖饮料的新税收仅仅令需求量略有下降。	Mexican consumption of sugary beverages nearly tripled between 1993 and 2014, and a new tax on sugary drinks has muted demand only slightly since then.
有核伊朗等长期存在的威胁仍然没有解决，而以色列的所有邻国眼下要么陷入了重重包围，要么正在快速走向动荡。	Not only do long-standing concerns like the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran remain unresolved; all of Israel’s neighbors are now either beset by or hurtling toward upheaval.
在2015年剩下的那段时间里中国人民银行一直在努力防止人民币贬值，而在消耗了巨量外汇储备之后，又在2016年2月决定引入一套新的汇率中间价报价制定规则。	For the rest of 2015, the PBOC struggled to prevent the renminbi from weakening. Having spent a huge amount of foreign-exchange reserves, it decided in February 2016 to introduce a new rule for setting the central parity rate.
可以想象，从长期看，中国成功让人民币加入SDR篮子也开启了其他政府让本国货币加入SDR篮子的游说大门。	Conceivably, over the longer term, China’s successful campaign could now open the door to lobbying by other governments to include their currencies as well.
每年我们都将他列入被监禁记者的年度普查报告，但即使只是想要证实他是否还活着的努力都往往会撞上一堵沉默的墙。	Each year, we included him in our annual census of imprisoned journalists, but attempts to verify whether he was even alive were always met with silence.
它在巴勒斯坦文化中同时起到了积极和消极的作用，既造就了巴勒斯坦人的坚定顽强，也纵容了他们的残忍、暴力和口是心非。	It operates both passively and actively in Palestinian culture, demanding stubbornness and tolerating ruthlessness, violence, and duplicity.
美国对中国贸易赤字占总赤字之比从0.3%增加到40 % ， 而对东亚贸易赤字占总赤字之比从20世纪90年代初的100%以上下降到50%左右。	As the ratio of its trade deficit with China to its total trade deficit rose to more than 40% from 0.3%, the ratio of its trade deficit with East Asia to its total trade deficit dropped to about 50%, from more than 100% in the early 1990s.
在这方面，创建当地的社交媒体网络可以帮助老年人与社区保持联系，比如把他们吸收到构建代际纽带的指导和辅导计划中；在线职业平台也可以让退休人员在家门之外找到工作机会；也应该有更多的城市向无法轻松前往就医的老年居民提供远程医疗和视频咨询服务。	E-career platforms could also be coded to match retirees with opportunities outside of the home. And more cities could deliver telemedicine and video consultations to elderly residents who are unable to easily travel to see doctors.
因为在民主制度下，掌权者就会意识到是人民让他们在位，如果人民认为他们是在为北京而不是香港的利益服务时，就会通过选举让他们下台。	For under a democratic system, those in power realize that it is the people who put them in office, and they will be voted out if they are perceived to be serving Beijing’s interests rather than Hong Kong’s.
如果你觉得这一令人难以置信的经济学听上去怎么那么像是经济巫术（voodoo economics ） ， 那是因为它们本来就是。	If this far-fetched projection sounds like voodoo economics all over again, that’s because it is.
包括美国在内的25个国家的300多名艺术家、作家、表演家和学者汇聚一堂，共同参与这场盛况空前的文化盛宴。	More than 300 artists, writers, performers, and scholars from more than 25 countries, including the US, are gathering for this unprecedented festival and conference.
在葡萄牙，当被问及第一代移民是否融合良好时79％的受访者给出了肯定的答复，而西班牙63%的人给出了肯定的回答。	In Portugal, when asked if first-generation immigrants are well integrated, 79% of respondents said yes, as did 63% of those surveyed in Spain.
肯尼迪的眼界被1962年7月美国大气层核试验打开。 这次核试验不经意地摧毁了至少六科人造卫星，其中一些属于苏联。	Kennedy’s eyes had been opened by a July 1962 US atmospheric nuclear test that inadvertently destroyed at least six satellites, including some belonging to the USSR.
最富阶层把持和控制着如此之多的资源，以至于他们实际上已经餍足了：在他们的财富中加上一点或拿掉一些对他们的幸福没有任何影响。	The superrich command and control so many resources that they are effectively satiated: increasing or decreasing how much wealth they have has no effect on their happiness.
但1967年托利峡谷号的前车之鉴表明 — — 人们用凝固汽油弹炸毁了那艘搁浅的油轮 — — 浮在水面的原油很难燃烧充分，而被称为“巧克力慕斯”的乳化油则根本无法燃烧。	But, as the 1967 Torrey Canyon experience showed – the stranded tanker was bombed with napalm – oil on water doesn’t burn well, and the emulsified oil called “chocolate mousse” hardly burned at all.
希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯 — — 据称是一名敬重切·格瓦拉的激进左翼份子，他为自己的儿子取名为埃内斯托 — — 现在已经成为中国的傀儡。	Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras – a supposedly radical leftist who, paying homage to Che Guevara, named his son Ernesto – has become a Chinese patsy.
因为碳排放削减与气温降低之间的因果关系之间有显著的时间差 — — 即使在本世纪中期成功将全球的排放量减半，但人们可能到等到世纪末都难以衡量其减缓气候变暖的效果如何。	There is a significant delay between carbon cuts and any temperature drop – even halving global emissions by mid-century would barely be measurable by the end of the century. Making green energy cheap and prevalent will also take a long time.
更进一步看，中国领导人已经制定了一个国家经济和治理现代化的30年目标。 很少看到世界上其它国家可以制定如此长远的政策目标，更不用说落实了。	More broadly, China’s leaders have set a 30-year target for modernizing the country’s economy and governance – a long-term goal that reflects the kind of vision that few countries have managed to articulate, let alone implement.
如果中国GDP的组成要素继续发生改变，从制造业拉动的出口和投资转变为服务和家庭消费，那么世界将大受裨益。	The world stands to benefit greatly if the components of China’s GDP continue to shift from manufacturing-led exports and investment to services and household consumption.
因此，存在大规模双重赤字和其他宏观经济脆弱点的新兴经济体可能在金融市场和增长率方面经历进一步的下行压力。	Thus, emerging economies with large twin deficits and other macroeconomic fragilities may experience further downward pressure on their financial markets and growth rates.
保守派领导人没能让韩国避免1997年的灾难，这为1998年自由派的反对党领导人金大中当选总统铺平了道路。	Conservative leaders’ collective inability to insulate South Korea from the events of 1997 cleared the way for a liberal opposition leader, Kim Dae-jung, to assume the presidency in 1998.
即便所有国家都必须应对全球化和技术变革的挑战，但欧盟的重要治理元素却是超出民主体制之外的，至少那些人们理解和接触的方面就是如此。	But while all countries must deal with the challenges of globalization and technological change, important elements of governance in the EU are beyond the reach of democratic institutions, at least those that people understand and relate to.
目前看来那些理论上应该对公众负责的官僚机构事实上却在看政党的脸色行事，并想尽一切办法阻止“让美国人来选”运动行使在明年秋天推举一个总统候选人的权利。	It turns out that most state bureaucracies, theoretically accountable to the public, in fact are accountable to the parties, and do everything they can to keep Americans Elect from claiming its right to a spot on the ballot next fall.
确保经济增长和应对气候变化这两个目标其实并不存在矛盾，也是可以并应当携手共进的；因为我们真正需要的是一个气候适应性强且低碳的经济增长。	Ensuring economic growth and addressing climate change do not have to be opposing goals. They can and should go hand in hand; what we need is climate-resilient, low-carbon growth.
假设债券收益率为2 ％ （ 而日本当前为0.1 ％ ） ，即便政府基本赤字相当于GDP的4 ％ ， 总赤字为5 ％ ， 以上这些债务比率仍将逐年保持稳定。	With bond yields at 2% (versus 0.1% in Japan today), those debt ratios would remain stable even if the government ran a primary deficit of 4% of GDP, and a total deficit of 5%, year after year.
而当有声电影于1927年首次亮相时，华纳兄弟影业的哈利·华纳质问 ， “ 究竟谁想听演员讲话 ？ ”	And, when movies with sound made their debut in 1927, Warner Brothers’ Harry Warner asked, “Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?”
在现阶段，金融公司正在为自己吸取教训，削减杠杆、储备资本与现金，然而当局却正在试图说服银行扩大贷款规模 — — 而这正是导致目前此次危机的原因。	At present, financial firms are learning the lessons for themselves, reducing leverage and hoarding capital and cash, whereas the authorities are trying to persuade banks to expand lending – precisely the strategy that led to the current crisis.
在听到诺基亚选择Windows的消息后，谷歌负责人维特·刚铎在推特上评论道 ： “ 两只火鸡凑到一起也变不成一只老鹰 。 ”	After hearing that Nokia had chosen Windows, Google director Vic Gundotra tweeted: “Two turkeys do not make an eagle.”
2008年危机前，受影响最大国家出现了大规模房地产泡沫（美国、英国、爱尔兰、西班牙、葡萄牙和意大利 ） 。	A large housing bubble preceded the 2008 crisis in the hardest-hit countries (the US, the UK, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy).
比如说，9月6日世界经济合作与发展组织发表了一份针对近期全球经济展望的中期评估，这份由该组织副秘书长兼首席经济学家皮尔·卡罗·帕多安（Pier Carlo Padoan）执笔的报告只是轻描淡写地指出可能很快会出现“重大风险 ” — —这其实就是不确定性的另一种说法。	For example, on September 6, the OECD issued an interim assessment on the near-term global outlook, written by Pier Carlo Padoan, that blandly reports “significant risks” on the horizon – the language of uncertainty itself.
中国允许针对日本大使馆的示威有时甚至是暴力行为，抗议日本修改的教科书上淡化了关于日本在二十世纪三十年代的侵略的描述。	China permitted demonstrations, sometimes violent, against Japanese consulates in protest of changes in Japanese textbooks that softened descriptions of Japan’s invasion in the 1930’s.
检方已经再度发出传票，要求其在3月21日出庭；而她是否出席仍是个未知数，即使她现在已经不再享有司法豁免权。	Prosecutors have issued another summons for her to appear in court on March 21; it is still unclear if she will, even though she has now lost her immunity from prosecution.
与此同时，应该采取重大措施平息伊朗邻国的忧虑。 其中一些国家有可能追求自身的核武器计划，以此防范伊朗在15年后可能取得的突破。	In the meantime, a major effort must be launched to assuage the concerns of Iran’s neighbors, several of which will be tempted to hedge their bets against Iran’s potential breakout in 15 years by pursuing nuclear programs of their own.
迈克尔·伊格纳季耶夫（Michael Ignatieff）明锐地观察到，叙利亚危机告诉我们，在“这样一个时刻，西方应该看到世界真的已经一分为二。	As Michael Ignatieff has wisely observed, Syria’s crisis has revealed that this is “the moment in which the West should see that the world has truly broken into two.
尽管在策略上一直存在争论，并且随着政府的变换而改变着，但总体方针一直没有变化，因为这受到了共和党和民主党的广泛支持。	Though US tactics were debated and shifted from administration to administration, the overarching approach remained consistent, because it was broadly supported by Republicans and Democrats alike.
然而这一进程如今却因全球经济危机而面临中断，因为本应不断扩大以实现上述发展的投资，出口和援助额都残遭削减。	But the global financial crisis threatens to undo this progress by reducing investment, exports and aid just as they should be expanding to build on these successes.
简言之，国际发展社会必须加大对草根方案的投入，为非洲人民赋权，而不是将他们视为解决自身困难的转包商。	Put simply, the international development community must do more to invest in grassroots solutions, empowering Africans rather than treating them as subcontractors to their own suffering.
如今，银行规模比任何时候都要庞大 — — 2011年美国前四大银行每一家的资产规模都超过了1万亿美元 — — 把它们分解，让所有细分都不具有系统重要性将是一个漫长而复杂的过程。	With banks now bigger than ever – America’s four largest each held more than $1 trillion in assets in 2011 – breaking them down to the point that no segment is systemically important would be a long and complex process, to say the least.
现代巴基斯坦身份意识在大部分方面是受到了对印度的印度教身份的否认以及对全球泛伊斯兰宪章的认同的影响，经济上的进步被认为是西方化，甚至更糟的是，被认为是印度化。	The modern Pakistani identity is shaped largely by the negation of an Indian-Hindu identity and the adoption of a global pan-Islamic charter. Economic advancement is taken to mean Westernization or worse, Indianization.
但如果我们要指责海洋世界游乐园如此对待其所圈养的动物的话，我们同时也应更深一层地反思我们囚禁驯养动物的方式。	But if we are pointing the finger at Sea World for what it does to its captive animals, we should also look more broadly at the way we confine performing animals.
此外，在对人类进化的描述中，费舍尔强调能够忍受长时间沉默的男性（以捕猎状态等待猎物）能将他们的基因传递下去，因此从基因的角度讲他们会选择“空间”偏好。	Moreover, in her description of our evolution, Fisher notes that males who could tolerate long periods of silence (waiting for animals while in hunt mode) survived to pass on their genes, thus genetically selecting to prefer “space.”
许多国家正在实施出口税或者禁止出口等紧急措施。 这些措施帮助了本国的公民，但是其他国家的人要付出代价。	Many are imposing emergency measures like export taxes or bans, which help their own citizens, but at the expense of those elsewhere.
在美国，有助于实现这一目标的措施包括贸易调整补助（Trade Adjustment Assistance ） ， 这是一个旨在专门帮助因为贸易而失去工作的人的计划。	In the US, measures that could help to achieve that include Trade Adjustment Assistance, a program aimed specifically at helping those who have lost their jobs due to trade.
而就在几个月之前，波士顿金融界大佬亨利·李·希金森就已经在一封给总统伍德罗·威尔逊的信中勾勒出了美国的新战略。	A few months earlier, the veteran Boston financier Henry Lee Higginson had sketched in a letter to President Woodrow Wilson what America’s new strategy should be.
在传统富人精英早已掌握权力的国家，从中产阶级吸收秉承共和党价值观的传统富裕阶层以外的精英具有宝贵的政治价值。	In countries where traditional wealthy elites have long wielded power, an alternative elite drawn from the middle classes and educated under republican values is politically invaluable.
如今，在前总统查韦斯及其继任者马杜罗治下，委内瑞拉选择了偿付其外国债券（其中有很大一部分持有在关系深厚的委内瑞拉富人手中 ） 。	To date, under former President Hugo Chávez and his successor, Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela has opted to service its foreign bonds, many of which are held by well-connected wealthy Venezuelans.
他们已经知道，紧缩将意味着更慢得增长 — — 事实上，衰退的可能性正在与日剧增 — — 而没有增长，欧元区的受困国家将无法治理债务。	They have recognized that austerity will mean slower growth – indeed, a recession is increasingly likely – and that, without growth, the eurozone’s distressed countries will not be able to manage their debts.
在交战地带有长期报道经验的记者，在墨西哥边境时比在波斯尼亚、阿富汗或者是伊拉克的时候，更担心他们的安全，虽然这里发生的许多暴力是内讧。	Journalists with long experience of war zones report being more worried about their safety in Mexico border than when they were in Bosnia, Afghanistan, or Iraq, though much of the violence is internecine.
雅典居民的人均生态足迹高于全国（也高于巴塞罗那、伊兹密尔、巴勒莫和瓦伦西亚等其他地中海城市居民 ） 。	The average ecological footprint of an Athenian is higher than the national average (and higher than the average footprint of residents in other Mediterranean cities such as Barcelona, Izmir, Palermo, and Valencia).
事实上，他们可能已经在考虑从陆上突入伊朗，并（这方面或许已经谋划已久了）对加沙地区的哈马斯和黎巴嫩真主党予以决定性打击。	Indeed, they probably contemplate land incursions into Iran, and possibly a decisive – and, from their perspective, long overdue – showdown with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
但特朗普总统却在行使这项权力方面打破了一个可以追溯到将近半个世纪前的悠久模式，即总统会（站在非党派立场上）重新任命表现良好的现任美联储主席。	In exercising that power, Donald Trump has broken a long-standing pattern, going back almost a half-century, whereby the president reappoints (on a non-partisan basis) the incumbent Fed chair, if he or she has been seen to be doing a good job.
在一篇最近的文章中，萨尔兹伯格（Fania Oz-Salzberger）在特拉维夫上空的火箭弹呼啸声中敦促她的政府为加沙村民提供医疗供给。	In a recent article, Fania Oz-Salzberger, writing from Tel Aviv while rockets were being intercepted overhead, urged her government to send medical supplies to the villages of Gaza.
11月15日，美国的瘸鸭总统，单边主义的信奉者乔治·W·布什将主持一次多边会议，探讨重塑全球经济体系的问题，这实在是个天大的讽刺。	There is no small irony in the fact that on November 15, America’s lame duck president, the unilateralist George W. Bush, is hosting a multilateral conference to discuss reshaping the global economic system.
它显然也不是被这些美国政府印出的纸片所带来的回报以及貌似毫无风险的安全性所吸引 — — 这两者在零利率时代和不断增大的违约忧虑之下都岌岌可危。	It certainly is not attracted by the return and seemingly riskless security of US government paper – both of which are much in play in an era of zero interest rates and mounting concerns about default.
经济学家早就认识到，要求一个人的代表性个体（representative agent）一直对未来保持理性期望往往会产生一些极不适用于现实世界的模型。	Economists have long recognized that requiring one’s representative agent to hold rational expectations of the future tends to produce models that are profoundly inapplicable to the real world.
但这一梦想总是遇到可怕的障碍：几十年 — — 有的时候是几百年 — — 之久的民族对立一再将可以创造共同利润的能源一体化协议拒之门外。	But such dreams always hit a formidable obstacle: national rivalries that date back decades – in some cases centuries – and that repeatedly keep mutually profitable energy-integration agreements from being signed.
该国一个占地15,000英亩的工业园区也遭到群众反对，导致中国购买建于该园区附近的亏损的汉班托塔港80%股权的计划无从继续。	And popular opposition to a 15,000-acre industrial zone in the country has held up China’s move to purchase an 80% stake in the loss-making Hambantota port that it built nearby.
但是直到我们把这件事捅到媒体后这些详细描述了过去十年间授权进行的窃听的数量、针对的人员以及进行时间的材料才被公布出来。	But it was only when we caught the media’s attention that the data – detailing the number of wiretaps authorized over the previous 10 years, against whom, and for how long – were released.
人权观察组织的布拉德·亚当斯（Brad Adams）将此次爆炸描述为“令人发指 ” ： “称之为战争罪行不足以充分描述它对受害者所造成的伤害或这类袭击对地区内儿童所造成的巨大影响 。 ”	Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch described the bombing as an act of “incomprehensible brutality”: “Calling this a war crime does not fully convey the harm done to the victims, or the far-reaching impact such attacks have on children in the region.”
但华盛顿反过来也明智地在赢得独立后交出了独裁权力，并在做了八年开国总统后以辞职的方式再一次交出了独裁权力。	But Washington, in turn, was wise to decline authoritarian powers following independence – and again when he resigned after eight years as the new country’s first president.
政府、企业、供应链管理者、企业公民战略师、非政府组织和其他各种力量应全力降低碳排放，同时利用各项资源为实现可持续城市化助力。	Governments, companies, supply-chain managers, corporate-citizenship strategists, NGOs, and others should commit to reducing their carbon footprints and to leveraging their resources to contribute to sustainable urbanization.
或者我们再来看看相邻的捷克，它的失业率只有2.3 % ， 为欧盟国家最低，2017年经济增长率为4.3 % 。	Or consider the neighboring Czech Republic, where unemployment is only 2.3%, the lowest rate in the EU, and the economy grew 4.3% in 2017.
事实上，我们的推测显示，流入新兴市场的总资本额将从1997年亚洲金融危机前的4000-5000亿美元上升到2007年和2008年的8000-9000亿美元。	In fact, our projections show that gross (or total) capital inflows to emerging markets will increase from US$400-500 billion just before the Asian crisis of 1997 to US$800-900 billion both in 2007 and 2008.
而正是美国在该区域的军事存在为该区域带来了稳定和清晰的预期，为亚洲带来了经济繁荣，最终促成了上述格局。	The boom that has brought this shift occurred because America’s military presence in the region provided stability and predictability.
对动物、人类和其它自然特征的描画并没有出现在4万至3万年前之前的非洲、欧洲和近东的考古记录中。 它们在各地出现的时间也早晚不一。	Depictions of animals, human beings, and other natural features do not occur in the three records - Africa, Europe, and the Near East - before 40,000-30,000 years ago, and they appear much later in some areas than others.
事实上，将微软和英特尔这样的高科技公司作为反垄断政策制裁的目标是尤其不恰当的，因为监管者行动的速度是绝对赶不上“因特网时间”的。	Indeed, high-tech companies like Microsoft and Intel are particularly unsuitable targets for antitrust policing, because regulators cannot possibly move at the speed of ‘Internet time.’
已经有证据表明，韩国和美国都不急于要求朝鲜完全放弃核材料和武器，而如果朝鲜不完全放弃核材料和武器，真正的去核化也无法实施和验证。	Already there is evidence that neither South Korea nor the US is anxious to demand from North Korea a full accounting of all its nuclear materials and weapons, without which real denuclearization cannot be carried out and verified.
在主要发达经济体，利率很快就会上升，而针对全球化的政治反对力量可能迫使政府放弃过去许下的发展援助承诺。	In the major advanced economies, interest rates will soon rise, and the political backlash against globalization may force governments to abandon their past commitments to development assistance.
欧盟的经济正在下滑。 已经到达了非常不景气的萧条时期，这种大萧条极有可能长久地持续下去，而经济滑坡的主要原因是欧洲内部问题。	The European Union’s economy is sliding into a severe and, in all likelihood, long-lasting recession, largely self-inflicted.
随着欧洲人口构成恶化，而且如果生产效率与工业化经济体的其他地方相比继续更为缓慢地增长，这一差距有可能扩大。	That gap is likely to widen as Europe’s demographic profile darkens, and if productivity continues to grow more slowly than elsewhere in the industrial economies.
既然财政部有首席经济顾问，为什么不可以有首席教育顾问和首席卫生顾问等技术官僚与教育和卫生部门领导共事？	Just as there is a chief economic adviser in the finance ministry, why not have a technocratic chief education adviser or a chief health adviser to work with the education and health secretaries?
对那些执行既定改革方案的国家，欧洲央行应当致力于使利率下降至与预期通胀率和增长率相配套的水平，而且必须公布实现上述目标的期限（比方说九个月 ） 。	For countries that are following agreed reform programs, the ECB should commit itself to bringing down interest rates to levels compatible with projected inflation and growth rates, and announce how long (say, nine months) this will continue.
同时许多假新闻都始发于今日俄罗斯（RT News）和俄罗斯卫星网（Sputnik）这两家受政府资助的俄罗斯媒体。	Many of the false reports originated from RT News and Sputnik, two state-funded Russian outlets.
欧元区外围高得不可持续的利率开始下降，人们因此认为温和复苏的大门已经打开，增长将在2015年出现加速。	With the threat of unsustainably high interest rates in the countries of the eurozone periphery having disappeared, the path to moderate recovery was supposedly open, to be followed by some acceleration in growth in 2015.
自动化所导致的就业岗位损失、根深蒂固的社会秩序、以及具破坏性的政治权力争斗加剧了经济不平等，并大大加深了我们的无力感。	Economic inequality – reinforced by job losses from automation, deeply entrenched social orders, and damaging political power dynamics – has contributed substantially to this sense of powerlessness.
如果今年的选举最后产生了一位中间派法国总统和法德合作的复兴，那么欧盟令人意外的对市场原教旨主义的沉迷很有可能寿终正寝。	If this year’s elections result in a centrist French president and a revival of Franco-German cooperation, the EU’s unexpected infatuation with market fundamentalism will probably end.
这就是2001年联合国千年发展目标（Millennium Development Goals）发布的目的。	That was the aim in 2001, when the United Nations adopted the Millennium Development Goals.
潜在的企业贷款损失成本 — — 国际货币基金组织的最新《全球金融稳定报告》估算约相当于GDP的 7 % — —是可控的。	The costs of potential losses on corporate loans – estimated at 7% of GDP in the IMF’s latest Global Financial Stability Report – are manageable.
如此说来，2009年许多国家经济会下滑4-5 % ， 一些国家甚至会下降10%甚至更多，进入实际的经济萧条期。	In all likelihood, a slew of countries will see output declines of 4-5% in 2009, with some. having true depression level drops, of 10% or more.
在经历了百年一遇的金融危机之后，相对于经济持续低迷所带来的政治、社会和经济风险，持续爆发的温和通货膨胀并没什么好担忧的。	Weighed against the political, social, and economic risks of continued slow growth after a once-in-a-century financial crisis, a sustained burst of moderate inflation is not something to worry about.
在这样的情况下，政府将必须提供鼓励方案、规章制度和税收政策。 遗憾的是，大多数受益者是穷人，那些公司却很有势力，而政府软弱和腐败，因此，好的环境保护措施都远不能得到保证和实施。	Unfortunately, however, when the main beneficiaries are the poor, corporations are powerful, and governments are weak or corrupt, good environmental practices are far from guaranteed.
