但更有可能普京是因为国内原因才吞并了克里米亚 — — 为了将俄罗斯人的注意力从国家经济不景气上移开，也是为了一雪亲欧示威者推翻他所支持的乌克兰政府的耻辱。	But it is more likely that Putin acted for domestic reasons – to distract Russians’ attention from their country’s failing economy and to salve the humiliation of watching pro-European demonstrators oust the Ukrainian government he backed.
背后的操作机制在技术上非常复杂，但由此得出的结果却相当直接：那就是一页文字，其中包含10个蓝色的链接。	The engineering behind it was technically complicated, but what you got was pretty rough: a page of text, broken up by ten blue links.
银行必须改变奖励过度冒险的薪酬模式；保护揭发者；招聘和培训合乎职业伦理的员工；并确保董事会扮演更加活跃的监督角色。	Banks must change compensation practices that reward excessive risk; protect whistleblowers; recruit and train staff to reflect proper ethics; and ensure that their boards of directors play a more active oversight role.
更不用说新兴市场国家的政客们没能明白的一点：即便美国袖手旁观，单方面降低他们过度的进口限制也会是个好主意。	And this is not to mention emerging market politicians’ failure to grasp that unilaterally reducing their excessive import restrictions would be a good idea even if rich countries sat on their hands.
然而，如今看来，美国的银行反倒不是危机的最大受害者，其中颇有一些 — — 包括几家出了名的问题银行 — — 居然在危机中坐大，成了长时段上的赢家。	But the banks that were most affected were elsewhere, and the long-term winners will be a few American banks – including some of the most notoriously weak banks – which will get bigger as a result of the crisis.
“我们不会在意是亚美尼亚人还是土耳其人 — — 只会在意是不是最好的 ， ” 一位土耳其与会者这样说。	“We weren’t focused on being Armenian or Turkish – just on being the best,” a Turkish participant noted.
然而听任赤字无限扩大或在提振就业和增长的进一步刺激过程中不断累积也会招致衰退，因为债券市场上的“志愿巡逻队”会把借贷成本推得老高。	But recession could also result if deficits are allowed to fester, or are increased with additional stimulus to boost jobs and growth, because bond-market vigilantes might push borrowing costs higher.
比如，汇回海外收入所享受的免税期被称为“美国就业创造法 ” （ American Job Creation Act ） 。	For example, a tax holiday to repatriate foreign earnings was called the “American Job Creation Act.”
特朗普团队的计划必须认识到，在这一漫长的货币扩张期内，金融市场和资源配置都被扭曲了，这恶化了财富不平等程度。	The plan must recognize that, during this protracted period of monetary expansion, both financial markets and resource-allocation have been distorted, worsening wealth inequality.
吸引和留住这些外国人才在英国退出后将变得更加困难，流向英国的欧盟公认不再能够随身转移养老金权利，其他单一市场的便利条件也将失去。	Attracting and retaining this foreign talent will become harder after Brexit, when EU workers moving to Britain will no longer be able to take their pension rights with them, and the other conveniences of a single labor market are lost.
中国以其一贯的敏感应对石原慎太郎的主张：拒绝接受石原慎太郎之子、日本主要反对党自民党总干事的访问计划。	China reacted to Ishihara’s proposal with its usual sensitivity: it refused to receive the scheduled visit of Ishihara’s son, who is Secretary-General of Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party, the country’s main opposition party.

同样，古兰经规定必须有四名目击证人才能证实通奸罪，但仅仅怀疑一名女性可能发生过违法性行为就足以按照习惯法的规则对其处以石刑。	Similarly, whereas the Koran requires four eyewitnesses as proof of adultery, mere suspicion of some unregulated, potentially sexual conduct by a woman warrants stoning under customary law.

据气候变化政府间委员会的数据，甲烷的吸热作用可以在20年时间里比二氧化碳厉害86倍，它造成了人为引起的变暖的五分之一。	According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane is 86 times more potent than CO2 as a heat-trapping gas over a 20-year period, and is responsible for about a fifth of the warming caused by humans.
例如有些记者遭到逮捕，罪名是在“Ergenekon”组织的授意下撰写文章和书籍，但问题是官方在多年调查之后连这个所谓的恐怖组织是否存在都尚未弄清	For example, journalists have been imprisoned for producing articles and books at the behest of an alleged terrorist organization called “Ergenekon,” whose existence has yet to be confirmed, despite years of investigation.
在美国，预算自动减赤（sequester）和其他税收和支出政策导致了巨大的2012—2014年财政拖累。	In the US, a budget sequester and other tax and spending policies led to a sharp fiscal drag in 2012-2014.
只有少数国家在核不扩散条约框架外开发核武器，而全面禁止核试验条约让核试验的数量从十年平均500起下降到几乎为零。	Only a handful of countries have developed nuclear weapons outside of the NPT, and the CTBT has reduced the number of nuclear tests from an average of 500 per decade to a mere trickle.

我们不需要等待十年去弄清楚欧盟是否可以帮助稳定乌克兰，同时还得面临领导层因其民主和法治精神的基本价值而感到威胁的俄罗斯。	We will not have to wait a decade to find out whether the EU can help to stabilize Ukraine while confronting a Russia whose leadership feels threatened by its fundamental values of democracy and the rule of law.
在美国总统特朗普威胁挑起贸易战、将欧洲拱手推给俄罗斯总统普京的复仇主义掠夺行为时，英国脱欧单干的时机非常危险。	And with US President Donald Trump threatening to start trade wars and abandon Europe to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s revanchist predations, this is an especially dangerous time for the UK to go it alone.
他强调降低国内税收，宣称这将释放新一波企业家精神；他提出要以保护主义方向重新谈判贸易协议，让就业机会留在美国。	He stresses cutting domestic taxes, which he asserts will unleash a new flurry of entrepreneurism, and renegotiating trade deals in a protectionist direction, to keep jobs in America.
萨默斯在最近的国际货币基金组织（IMF）会议上指出，到2005年左右，美国新投资的平均预期回报比可以预见的所有美联储基准利率降息都要低。	By the mid-2000’s, Summers argued at a recent International Monetary Fund conference, the average prospective return on new investment in the United States had fallen below any feasible reduction in the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate.
但是，由于我们的努力和长期一起的共同生活，最重要的是，由于家人和好友的支持，我们从沮丧、愤怒到悲伤的情绪反应得到了缓解和升华。	But our emotional reactions, from frustration and anger to sadness, have been cushioned and sublimated by our work, the long rhythm of our days together, and, above all, by the support of family and close friends.
货币是一种公共产品，它允许每个人进行自由交换，而不必诉诸传统社会所依赖的那种模糊且低效的以物易物模式。	Money is a public good that allows individuals to enter into free exchange without having to resort to the kind of imprecise, inefficient bartering on which traditional societies depended.
艾滋病运动的教训可以写全整个字母表，但在H结尾比较合适，因为人权推动了艾滋病响应机制，也应该推动NCD响应机制。	The list of AIDS lessons could continue throughout the alphabet, but ending with “H” is apt, given that human rights drove the response, and should drive the response to NCDs.
尽管一些医院仍饱受人手不足之苦，但政府已经开始填补这一空缺，启动了一项从20多家美国机构聘请专家协助本国临床专家的计划。	While some hospitals still suffer from staff shortages, the government has sought to patch these holes through an initiative that employs faculty from over 20 US institutions to assist in training our clinical specialists.
那场名为伊拉克战争的历史性失败、世俗阿拉伯国家主义的终结和高涨的石油和天然气价格给该地区带来了深远的变化。	The historical failure named Iraq war, the demise of secular Arab nationalism and the soaring oil and gas prices have wrought profound changes in the region.
但如果欧盟国家开始竞争中国的市场份额，那么俄罗斯可能很快就会不敌诱惑而向北京的共产党政权出售他们最好的武器。	However, if EU countries start competing for a share of the Chinese market, the Russians could soon be tempted to sell their best arms to the communist regime in Beijing.

除非很快采取变化，否则作为这一模式的基础的外汇机制和资本管制将会变得过于根深蒂固，调整的机会窗口也会错失。	Unless change comes soon, the foreign-exchange regime and capital controls on which the model relies will become too deeply entrenched, and the window of opportunity for adjustment will be missed.
特朗普则没有表现出任何策略思维迹象；事实上，他的政策冲动有可能给叙利亚挖下一个更深的深坑，美国、英国和俄罗斯都会深陷其中。	Trump has shown no evidence of it; in fact, his policy impulsiveness risks digging an even deeper hole for Syria, into which the US, Britain, and Russia will be sucked.
在2003年7月1日，香港回归六周年的纪念日当天，有近百万人走上香港街头举行反对一项反颠覆立法的和平抗议。 该项立法本可能会侵蚀新闻、宗教和集会的自由。	On July 1, 2003, the sixth anniversary of the handover, nearly a million people took to Hong Kong’s streets in a peaceful protest against an anti-subversion bill that would have eroded freedom of the press, of religion, and of association.

无奈欧洲的政治机构不愿采用上述任何一个选项，而是选择去敷衍拖延希腊的破产状况 — — 并假装已经通过新一批的贷款解决了这一问题。	Alas, Europe’s political establishment, unwilling to adopt either option, has chosen to extend Greece’s insolvency – which it pretends has been resolved through new loan tranches.
政治伊斯兰教形式多种多样，其中就包括1928年成立的穆斯林兄弟会（Muslin Brotherhood ） 。	The phenomenon took many forms, including the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928.

但是，如果中东局势恶化，构成联合国五大常任理事国的集体责任感，那么，如今中俄两国的差别在明天也就不再重要。	But the differences between Russia and China today may prove to be less significant tomorrow if the deterioration in the Middle East imposes a sense of collective responsibility on all five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
下一任总统能否在不挑起军事干预和圣战的情况下宣传民主价值观，并同时在建立和维护相互依赖世界所需机构的过程中成功地成为非霸权主义主导？	Can the next president promote democratic values without military intervention and crusades, and at the same time take a non-hegemonic lead in establishing and maintaining the institutions needed for a world of interdependence?
共和党的尼克松1968年当选美国总统，靠的是缩减民主党的扩张性大社会（Great Society）计划。	The Republican Richard Nixon was elected US President in 1968 on a platform of scaling down the Democrats’ expensive Great Society programs.

一些人认为政策可以调整从而避免带来有意义的伤害，这通常是因为政策所产生的经济条件方面的改善将消除进一步刺激的需要。	Some believe that policy can be calibrated to stop short of inflicting meaningful harm, usually because the resulting improvement in economic conditions will obviate the need for continued stimulus.
中国正在受到停止在世界货币市场内支撑美元的干涉政策的压力，其反对者强调这样的政策正在给其他国家造成多大的伤害。	China is being pressured to halt its interventions to prop up the US dollar in world currency markets, with opponents emphasizing how much harm the policy is causing to other countries.
金砖国家的崛起说到底是世界经济的幸事，但皮克的兴起带来了实实在在的威胁 — — 特别是当他们开始将对抗式方针用于外交事务和全球经济治理中时。	Unlike the emergence of the BRICS, which ultimately was a boon to the world economy, the rise of the PEKOs poses a real threat – especially as they begin to apply their confrontational approach to foreign affairs and global economic governance.
实际上，黎巴嫩和加沙的危机让人意识到，如果希望回到和平进程中，关押在以色列的阿拉伯囚犯以及以色列的单边主义这两大痛苦的问题必须得到解决。	Indeed, the crises in Lebanon and Gaza have brought about a realization that two festering issues – Arab prisoners in Israel, and Israeli unilateralism – must be resolved if there is to be any hope of a return to the peace process.
没有吸取20世纪30年代最有力的教训之一（是的，就是凯恩斯主义 ） — —财政政策是摆脱流动性陷阱的唯一办法 — — 也许是最大的悲剧。	Failing to heed one of the most powerful (yes, Keynesian) lessons of the 1930s – that fiscal policy is the only way out of a liquidity trap – could be the greatest tragedy of all.
如此严重的收入失衡不仅与人们普遍信奉的社会公平和机会均等准则无法匹配；更对美国的经济和民主制度造成了严重威胁。	Such a high level of inequality is not only incompatible with widely held norms of social justice and equality of opportunity; it poses a serious threat to America’s economy and democracy.

两国政府正在考虑的诸多非市场的“贸易措施”或许会让双边贸易失衡下降，但同时也会使它们与世界其它国家的失衡加大。 这种拆东墙补西墙的解决方法将令两国及世界其它国家的消费者甚至企业蒙受损失。	The non-market “trade remedies” being considered by the US and China might produce a smaller trade imbalance between the two economies, but at the cost of a larger imbalance with the rest of the world.
另外，除了政治的考量之外，一些以美元为主要储备货币的国家也会因为担心美元的动荡引起自身的损失，目前考虑到另一种���代的储备货币。	And, apart from possible political considerations, large holders of dollars would find a substitution account attractive as a form of protection against strong fluctuations in the dollar’s value.
艾滋病的传染将戛然而止，正如大都市地区麻疹在儿童中的传染情况在80%的儿童获得免疫时就会结束，即使另外20%儿童没有接种。	The ongoing epidemic would grind to a halt, just as a measles epidemic among children in a metropolitan area ends when 80% percent of the children are vaccinated, even if the other 20% percent of children remain unvaccinated.
也许是衰落的标志，我们现在也有了黑色星期五，这是美国的舶来品，我们被鼓动本着现代圣诞精神大肆欢饮 ， “ 买买买”直到手软。	And just in case there was any sign of flagging, we now have Black Friday, an export from the United States, when we are all encouraged to drink deep of the modern Christmas spirit and shop until we drop.
明年，当跨政府气候变化委员会（Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change）开始发布其最新的科学证据评估报告时，气候变化失控的迹象必定会在文明社会掀起波澜。	And next year, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change begins publishing its latest assessment of the scientific evidence, the prospect of runaway climate change is bound to mobilize civil society.
在发达国家，资产价值的下跌以及随之而来的普遍的恐惧心理沉重地打击了消费者和企业的信心，这导致消费持续下降以及公司削减投资。	In the advanced countries, the fall in asset values and, more generally, fear of what comes next has shattered consumer and business confidence. Consumption is dropping, and companies are cutting investment.
这虽然能在一段时期内刺激增长，但当泡沫破灭，金融体系的巨额债务立马将经济拖入通缩和停滞的漩涡，而且日本到现在还没有完全脱身。	That may have spurred growth for a while, but when the bubbles burst, the financial system’s huge debts helped push the economy into a bout of deflation and stagnation from which it has still not fully emerged.

事实上，就在曼德拉走过罗本岛监狱大门，宣告非洲自由斗争胜利20年后的今天，科特迪瓦和津巴布韦等国的“强人”却继续罔顾人民的意愿，紧抱着权力不放。	Indeed, more than two decades after Mandela walked through the prison gates, supposedly completing Africa’s struggle for freedom, “Big Men” in countries like Congo and Zimbabwe continue to cling to power against the will of their people.
萨默斯和德隆还计算出设备投资的社会回报远大于私人回报，并因此得出了“一个强有力的论据似乎存在以证明经济政策不会惩罚 — — 而实际上是回报 — — 那些设备投资者 ” 。	Summers and DeLong also calculate that the social returns from equipment investment are far larger than private returns.
但中国领导人从未划定过“九条虚线”的确切位置，也没有明确过他们的要求是仅仅针对某些地貌，还是更为宽泛的海洋和大陆架。	But China’s leaders have never been clear about the exact location of the “nine-dotted line,” or about whether their claims refer only to certain land features, or also to more extensive continental shelves and seas.
其中一些预测者要比另外一些更为悲观（相比之下英国预算责任办公室算是尤其乐观的 ） ， 但似乎没有人能悲观到足够接近真相的程度。	Some forecasters are more pessimistic than others (the OBR has a particularly sunny disposition), but no one, it seems, has been pessimistic enough.

我们预测工资将承受下行压力，并通过抑制国内需求导致更低的就业和更高的不平等性（所有国家组别都是如此 ） 。	We projected downward wage pressure, which, by depressing domestic demand, would lead to lower employment and higher inequality in all country groupings.
与此同时，大规模的腐败彻底破坏了埃及的经济，近两年来的经济增长减少将近一半以上，随之而来的还有失业率上升、通货膨胀增大和货币贬值。	Meanwhile, massive corruption is devastating Egypt’s economy, with growth falling by half in the last two years, accompanied by rising unemployment, higher inflation, and currency depreciation.
阿根廷采取了极富创新精神的措施，用老债务换新债务 — — 大概是三折多一点的折算比例 — — 加上GDP指数债券。	In a highly innovative move, Argentina exchanged old debt for new debt – at about 30 cents on the dollar or a little more – plus a GDP-indexed bond.
许多欧盟领导人在与中国的“战略性合作”方式中看到了这种尊种，而这一新合作方式将有助于抑制超级大国美国的权利。	Many EU leaders see newfound respect coming in the form of a “strategic partnership” with China that is designed to balance the power of the United States.

Cohen have outlined, the US should act now to revive its pragmatic industrial-policy tradition, put finance back to work for the real economy, and invest in new activities that can reinvigorate a struggling middle class.
在希腊问题上，这些经济学家认为，财政政策转向“紧缩 ” — —即缩小公共部门 — — 导致了需求急剧萎缩，从而发生萧条。	Looking at Greece, these economists argue that a shift in fiscal policy to “austerity” – a smaller public sector – has brought an acute deficiency of demand and thus a depression.
相反，近年来这些赞助人的位置正逐渐被一批背景可疑的新富人所取代，这些人往往从事的是高利贷或者其他不正当行业。	Instead, these respectable supporters have gradually been replaced over the years by a shady new class of rich Japanese, who have risen through loan-sharking and other dubious businesses.
当前的僵持始于6月中旬，当时，印度的紧密盟友不丹发现解放军正在扩建一条通过洞朗的公路。 洞朗是喜马拉雅山区的一片高原，属于不丹领土，但中国对其有领土主张。	The current standoff began in mid-June, when Bhutan, a close ally of India, discovered the People’s Liberation Army trying to extend a road through Doklam, a high-altitude plateau in the Himalayas that belongs to Bhutan, but is claimed by China.

他相信，他在做正确的事，等待叙利亚冲突自己水落石出，同时将美国人民生民安全威胁最小化，这才是审慎的战略。	He believes that he is doing the right thing and following the prudent course in waiting for the Syrian conflict to burn itself out in some way while minimizing the long-term risk to American lives.
世界银行的新教育战略 — — “有教无类 — — 为促进发展投资人类知识和技能 ” （ Learning for All – Investing in People’s Knowledge and Skills to Promote Development ） — —便以此为目标。	The World Bank’s new education strategy, “Learning for All – Investing in People’s Knowledge and Skills to Promote Development,” highlights this imperative.

这就是为什么必须以税收替补的形式实施能源税，而所得税和工资税同时降低来让实际转移给政府的资源保持相同的水平。	That is why the energy tax must be imposed as a tax substitution, with income or payroll taxes simultaneously reduced to keep real resource transfers to government at a constant level.

美国是在19世纪进入后三分之一阶段随着全球化刚刚开始崛起的世界大国，这与美国西部开放的时间恰好是一致的。	America was just beginning to emerge as a world power during the surge of globalization in the last third of the nineteenth century, which coincided with the opening up of the American West.
如何能既鼓励那些革命性的主宰整个市场的创新，又能限制对市场支配力的滥用，这个问题在数字时代之前早就已经存在了。	The question of how to encourage transformational, market-dominating innovations while limiting the abuse of market power long precedes the digital age.
这不足为奇，全世界有超过5.7亿农民和七十亿消费者，但从田间到店头，全球工业农业的价值链控制在一小撮公司手中。	This is not surprising. Although there are more than 570 million farmers and seven billion consumers worldwide, just a handful of companies control the global industrial-agriculture value chain – from field to shop counter.
联合国儿童基金会巴基斯坦消灭脊髓灰质炎计划主管艾丹·奥利里（Aidan O’Leary）指出 ， “ 女接种员推动了每一项任务的进展 。 ”	As Aidan O’Leary, UNICEF’s chief of anti-polio efforts in Pakistan, has noted, “female vaccinators are driving every single operational gain that is being made.”
在去年12月的一次会议中，我询问SEC主席夏皮罗（Mary Schapiro ） ， 她的手下准备何时重新实施该规则。	At a conference last December, I asked SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro when her agency was planning to reintroduce the rule.
事实上，与其说是燃油税本身还不如说是其背后所代表的因素引发了这次黄背心抗议运动：那就是政府对生活在法国规模最大的城市中心以外的中产阶级的困境漠不关心。	In reality, the eruption of the Yellow Vest protests was less about the fuel tax than what its introduction represented: the government’s indifference to the plight of the middle class outside France’s largest urban centers.
2016年的潘多拉魔盒所释放出来的魔鬼 — — 回荡在关于特朗普支持者对美国有色人种的法西斯主义辱骂的广为流传的报道中 — — 将在美国的自我认知中自由游动，同时毒害其他所有人的认知。	And the demons released from Pandora’s box in 2016 – echoing in widespread reports of racist taunts by Trump supporters of non-whites in America – will continue to roam free in the country’s self-perception, and taint everyone else’s perception, too.
这意味着要在美国这类民族和种族多元化社会维持强大的社会福利国家的挑战并不现实，但可以促进相互尊重和包容。	However, this means that the challenge of maintaining a strong social welfare state in ethnically and racially diverse societies such as the US is not economic, but one of promoting respect and inclusiveness.
那一刻标志着多年来的战争以及难以言说的苦难终于终结，而革命在经历了流血与牺牲，英雄主义与敌人的错误以及斯大林这个所谓朋友的操纵与干预之后，终于获得了胜利。	That moment marked the end of years of war and terrible hardship; the revolution had been won through blood, sacrifice, heroism, the mistakes of enemies, and the manipulative assistance of Stalin, who purported to be a friend.
比如波兰前总统列赫·瓦文萨(Lech Walesa)最近就前往突尼斯，为一个旨在协助该国建立完善宪政改革和选举法的波兰项目提供顾问意见。	For example, former President Lech Wałesa recently visited Tunisia to offer advice as part of a Polish program to help Tunisia devise robust constitutional reforms and election laws.
但是，更确切地说，学者们所言是 自由 民主政体之间几乎从不开战，这很可能是因为自由主义宪政文化比仅仅选举的事实更重要。	But, more carefully stated, what scholars show is that liberal democracies almost never go to war with each other, and it may be that a liberal constitutional culture is more important than the mere fact of elections.
其实《里斯本条约》的通过已经为欧洲政治的组成元素增添了兼具长远眼光的现实主义理念，而欧盟未来的扩张至此已不再存在任何制度上的障碍。	The ratification of the Lisbon Treaty allows for an element of visionary realism in European politics, as there are no longer any institutional obstacles to the future enlargement of the EU.
印度与伊朗的密切关系建立在长期文化、社会、政治和经济关系的基础之上，目前印度正在出资进行伊朗港口查赫巴尔的修缮工作，以期通过该港口打通阿富汗的直达通道。	India has a strong relationship with Iran, underpinned by long-standing cultural, social, political, and economic ties, with India now funding an overhaul of the Iranian port of Chabahar, which will give it direct access to Afghanistan.
普京一直是“强力集团 ” （ siloviki，前苏联军事和情报官员）的拥趸，他们占据了普京内阁的大部分职位，负责克里姆林宫主宰俄罗斯政治生活的权力。	Putin has always been a great fan of the siloviki – former Soviet military and intelligence officers – who make up the bulk of his cabinet and account for the Kremlin’s unchecked power over Russian political life.
在1993年，在挪威的秘密双边谈判中（美国不知情 ） ， 以色列和巴勒斯坦解放组织就相互承认和建立临时巴勒斯坦自治政府达成协议。	In 1993, in secret bilateral negotiations in Norway (unknown to the Americans), Israel and the PLO reached an agreement about mutual recognition and the creation of a provisional Palestinian Autonomous Authority.
去年，英国、欧盟其他国家以及全世界大大小小的公司举行了数不清的会议和高规格规划研讨会为英国脱欧投票做好准备。	In the past year, companies big and small in the UK, elsewhere in the EU, and around the world have held countless meetings and high-level planning sessions to prepare for a Brexit vote.
如果美联储采取任何贷款-价值比上限政策，还将激起美国人对集中金融权力的担忧 — — 这一担忧自危机以来便有所增强。	Any attempt by the Fed to impose caps on loan-to-value ratios would also excite Americans’ fears of concentrated financial power – fears that have intensified since the crisis.
在今年3月，已经批准财政协议的欧洲理事会将注意力转向了重振经济增长方面，而这也是实现长期财政稳定的关键。	In March, having agreed on the fiscal treaty, the European Council turned its attention to reviving economic growth, which will be the key to long-term fiscal sustainability.
另一个同样重要的挑战则是北约与俄罗斯之间的合作，双方于今年11月的北约里斯本峰会上同意在导弹防御系统上展开合作。	Another, equally important challenge is cooperation between NATO and Russia, which agreed at NATO’s Lisbon summit in November to collaborate on the Alliance’s anti-missile defenses.
巴黎 - - 拯救金融体系是经济史上的一个怪异时刻，因为它的最大受益者是那些从市场的非理性繁荣中获得最多利益的人 - - 金融公司的大佬们。	PARIS – The bailout of the financial system was a bizarre moment in economic history, for it benefited those who benefited most from the markets’ irrational exuberance – the bosses of financial firms.
这还不算，巴西的巨型国家石油企业巴西石油公司（Petrobrás）已经着手实施沿里约热内卢海岸线发现的两块巨型深水油田的开发工作。	And, as if this good news were not enough, Brazil’s giant state oil company, Petrobrás, is already at work developing two huge deep-water oil fields discovered in the sea off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.
以人权的名义，现在是时候揭开战后人员失踪真相，以及为什么在10年时间里，联合国官员不理睬受害者家属提出的申诉，没有进行任何刑事调查。	And in the name of human rights, it is time for the truth to come out about the people who went missing after the conflict, and about why, for a decade, UN officials ignored appeals by the victims’ families and launched no criminal investigation.
美国在过去五十年里无论有多少缺陷，但毕竟还是一个良性的强国。 尽管我们重视中国和印度等新强国的兴起，但是，这些国家是否会像美国那样还有待观察。	As much as we all value the rise of new powers like China and India, it remains to be seen whether these countries will become as benevolent a power as America, however flawed, has been over the past half-century.
然而在长期看来，投资新兴市场经济体，尤其是那些宏观经济基础良好，政治环境稳定且中产阶级不断壮大的国家，是前景良好的。	Over the long term, however, the outlook for investing in emerging-market economies, particularly those with strong macroeconomic fundamentals, stable political environments, and an expanding middle class, is promising.
德国的抵制导致欧洲央行迟迟不能干预债券市场；最后欧洲央行终于启动了其债券购买计划，但也是在德国的默许下。	And German resistance contributed to a delay in the ECB’s intervention in bond markets; when the ECB finally did launch its bond-buying program, it did so with Germany’s tacit approval.
这些作家们认为，民主的生活方式趋向于摧毁原创性思维并且压制文化中的阳春白雪，造成平庸，从而使得公民受到民主的敌人们的蛊惑。	The democratic way of life, these writers argue, tends to destroy original thought and to suppress “high” culture, yielding a mediocrity that leaves citizens vulnerable to democracy’s enemies.
但是，在高能效的瑞士，创造每一千美元的能源使用量仅为100公斤，丹麦为110公斤，相比之下美国的能源使用量高达190公斤。	But, in energy-efficient Switzerland, energy use is just 100 kg per $1,000 of GDP, and in Demark it is just 110 kg, compared with 190 kg in the US.
平心而论，美国质疑中国希望构建的新秩序是否能与美国所领导的秩序一样公开并以规则为基础 — — 从而让中国获得实现其壮观经济崛起所需要的市场 — — 这是正确的。	To be sure, the US is right to wonder whether the new order that China hopes to build will be as open and rules-based as the American-led order – the one that gave China the market access it needed to achieve its spectacular economic rise.
1980年春，我还是德克萨斯州 油田上的一名年轻工人，我目睹美国基准原油价格上涨到每桶45美元 — — 相当于今天的138美元。	As a young man working in the Texas oil patch in the spring of 1980, I watched prices for the US benchmark crude rise as high as $45 a barrel – $138 in today’s dollars.
布雷顿森林机构（世界银行和国际货币基金组织 ） 、 马歇尔计划、欧洲经济共同体等项目支持了世界经济重要部分的复兴。	Initiatives like the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund), the Marshall Plan, and the European Economic Community supported the reconstruction of significant portions of the world economy.
但是那对于海豹、阿黛利企鹅、座头鲸、蓝鲸以及其他许多物种来说却是一个坏消息，因为绝大部分南极海洋生态系统的生物体依靠吃磷虾或者其他吃磷虾的东西为生。	But that’s bad news for leopard seals and Adelie penguins, humpback and blue whales, and many other species, because most organisms in the Antarctic marine ecosystem eat either krill or something that eats krill.
因为新闻投诉委员会“没有能力处理系统性非法侵犯隐私权的行为 ” ， 议会联合委员会提出建议改革监管机构。	Because the PCC “was not equipped to deal with systemic and illegal invasions of privacy,” the committee set out proposals for a reformed regulator.
通过积极参政、在理性自利的基础上进行投票以及培养抵制独裁所需的节制感，中产阶级极大地推动了民主进程。	By participating actively in politics, basing their electoral choices on rational self-interest, and developing the sense of moderation needed to resist dictatorship, the middle class promotes democratic progress.
最后，偿债能力比率应该有所补充 — — 通过让银行承担发行大量无抵押可转换债务（100%由其自有资本做支持）的义务来实现。	Finally, solvency rules should be complemented by an obligation that banks issue a substantial amount of non-collateralized debt – on the order of 100% of their capital – that is convertible into equity.
波恩—去年12月在巴黎，世界领导人齐聚一堂，就一系列全球经济去碳化和提升我们适应气候变化的能力的目标和路径形成了一致。	BONN – Last December in Paris, world leaders came together to agree on a set of goals and pathways for decarbonizing the global economy and increasing our capacity to adapt to climate change.
例如，在目前由参与计划的专家承包机构负责管理的免费公立学校，计划实施的第一年学习成绩就有了60%的提升。	For example, at the free public schools currently managed by expert contractors participating in the program, learning outcomes improved by 60% in the first year.
此外，过去十年中国建设了许多必须的硬件基础设施（也许有些领域有过量之嫌 ） ， 现在中国政府开始强调建软件基础设施，包括为促进市场发展的法律、会计、金融、及互联网等服务行业。	Moreover, having built the needed physical infrastructure in the last decade (perhaps to excess), China is now emphasizing the software infrastructure needed to sustain the growth of its burgeoning services sector.
简而言之，他们处在一个大部分国际债务 — — 以及更大份额的全球贸易 — — 仍然是以硬通货币计价的世界里。	Simply put, they live in a world where a large fraction of international debt – and an even larger share of global trade – is still denominated in hard currency.
事实上，他是我见到过最具魅力的迷人领袖；另外两位 — — 前联合国秘书长科菲·安南和前美国国务卿柯林·鲍威尔 — — 不是非洲人就是非洲裔美国人。	In fact, he is among the most charismatic and charming leaders I have met; the other two – former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former US Secretary of State Colin Powell – also are either African or African-American.
近日，国防部长阿什顿·卡特敦促美国网络司令部 — — 即致力于网络空间作战的军事部门 — — 加强反对伊斯兰国的战斗。	Recently, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter urged US Cyber Command – the arm of the military dedicated to cyberspace operations – to “intensify the fight” against ISIS.
去年十一月被亚努科维奇拒绝的联合协定 — — 当时这一决定曾引发导致其政府垮台的民众抗议 — — 自2007年来就一直处在谈判的过程当中。	The Association Agreement that Yanukovych rejected last November – a decision that incited the popular protests that brought down his government – had been under negotiation since 2007.
坎布里奇 — — 上个月，联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯呼吁采取全球行动，尽可能减少电子战对平民所造成的危害。	CAMBRIDGE – Last month, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for global action to minimize the risk posed by electronic warfare to civilians.
以畜牧生产为例，肉、蛋、奶等很多食物来源于畜牧生产 — — 它丰富了发展中国家食物的品种，同时有数百万人以此谋生。	Consider livestock production, which accounts for many foods – including milk, eggs, and meat – that have enriched diets in developing countries and provide livelihoods for millions.
在其他北欧债权国的支持下，德国无情地强制实行其财政原则，尽管这样做的系统性后果是造成压力（比如，希腊和西班牙的政府都已经改变 ） 。	Supported by other northern European creditors, Germany enforced its fiscal principles relentlessly, despite the systemic consequences for those it was pressuring (Greece and Spain, for example, now have different governments).
2013年的首要问题是穆尔西能否再续加沙辉煌，解决另一个重大的外交难题：结束超过30年的相互敌视并重塑与伊朗的关系。	The big question for 2013 is whether Morsi will follow his achievement in Gaza by tackling another major diplomatic challenge: rebuilding relations with Iran after more than three decades of animosity.
在经历过一年多的时间里天天发生的闹剧后，世界开始逐渐适应特朗普政府的执政现状，包括经常对外国领导人发起人身攻击和即便是与亲密盟友的关系都变幻莫测。	After over a year of near-daily drama, the world has begun to adjust to the reality of the Trump administration, which includes frequent ad hominem attacks on foreign leaders and capriciousness in relations even with close allies.
它不会将扣减和豁免数字限制在AGI的2 % ， 只是将由此产生的个人利用这些特别条款获得的税收减免额 — — 也就是税收福利 — — 限制在这一范围内。	It would not limit the amount of deductions and exclusions to 2% of AGI, but rather would limit the resulting tax reduction – that is, the tax benefit – that the individual gets by using all these special features.
在这样的压力下，医学科学家们容易产生幻想，认为他们的研究工具和过程在一定程度上将他们从自身的精神和身体局限中解脱出来。	Under this strain, medical research scientists are susceptible to the dream that their instruments and procedures have somehow freed them from the limitations of their minds and bodies.
全球权力分配所引发的结构性反美运动在伊拉克战争爆发前就非常明显，这与克林顿在任时由美国领导的全球化形成了鲜明的对照。	The structural anti-Americanism arising from the global distribution of power was evident well before the Iraq war, in the opposition to American-led globalization during the Clinton years.
我自己则发现只要对谷歌翻译做一些修改，就能得到不错的结果，因此剩下了不少翻译成本，不过这对我请来做翻译的研究生来说意味着收入损失。	I myself have saved on translation costs since realizing that, with some edits by me, Google Translate can work just fine, though this means lost income for the graduate students whom I used to hire the task.
于是敏突出强调沃尔特斯支持特朗普“废除和取代”廉价医保法案（即“奥巴马医保法案 ” ） 的企图，还强调她对特朗普更大范围预算缩减计划的支持。	So Min has highlighted Walters’ support for Trump’s attempt to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”), as well as her backing for his broader budget-cutting agenda.
此外，尽管杀虫剂和其他污染物被认为会杀死一半人类，良好的杀虫剂管制让每年美国死亡人数只有20例，同时，杀虫剂的使用创造了更廉价、更充足的粮食供给。	And, while pesticides and other pollutants were seen to kill off perhaps half of humanity, well-regulated pesticides cause about 20 deaths each year in the US, whereas they have significant upsides in creating cheaper and more plentiful food.
希腊现已驱逐两名俄罗斯外交官，致使俄罗斯取消外交部长谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫访问雅典的行程，并宣布将希腊外交官逐出莫斯科。	Greece has now expelled two Russian diplomats, leading Russia to cancel an upcoming visit to Athens by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and to announce the expulsion of Greek diplomats from Moscow.
中国当然不希望看到一个拥有核武器或四处叫战的朝鲜，但它更害怕的是一个令无数难民争相涌入己方边境的失败国家。	China does not want a nuclear or belligerent North Korea, but it is even more concerned about a failed state collapsing on its border.
比如，我们在课程之处的调查表明，只有21%的人自称“几乎每次都会”交叉验证自己所接触到的新闻，在一个媒体信任度低但新闻消费率高的的国家，这一比例令人担忧。	For example, when we surveyed people at the beginning of the course, only 21% said that they “almost always” crosschecked the news they consume, a troubling rate for a country where trust in media is low but consumption is high.
综合起来考虑，很容易设想得到GDP增长走向在未来十年 — — 可能不止十年 — — 比正常水平低1 % 。	Taken together, these factors make it easy to imagine trend GDP growth being one percentage point below normal for another decade, possibly even longer.
公共支出改革的政治经济学很复杂，精心设计的宏观经济计划可能被分赃政治（pork-barrel politics）绑架。	The political economy of public-spending reform is tricky, and well-designed macroeconomic plans can be taken hostage by pork-barrel politics.
随后巴基斯坦建立了议会民主制，由富有魅力的总理扎比卡尔·阿里·布托（Zulfikar Ali Bhutto）所领导。	Afterwards, Pakistan was governed as a parliamentary democracy, led by the charismatic Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
无论如何，民族主义政客都有一个巨大的优势，他们必须要务实的计划：所有好东西都会随着主权的到来而到来。	Either way, nationalist politicians enjoy the huge advantage of not requiring a practical program: all good things will flow from sovereignty.
当然，如果外汇储备继续以每年5,000亿美元（2015年的数字）的速度消耗，这一缓冲将在六年后耗尽。	Of course, this cushion would effectively vanish in six years if foreign reserves were to continue falling at the same $500 billion annual rate recorded in 2015.
然后还有英国政治领导层的问题，对于他们来说扩大是一种阻止机构深化改革，以及实际上化解将欧洲政治化的一个途径。	Then there is Britain’s political leadership, for whom enlargement is a way to avoid deepening, and, indeed, to dissolve political Europe.
而其成本是每年1万亿美元或以上 — — 这是一个昂贵得令人咋舌的方法，而不会在本世纪末之前造成潜在洪水和干旱发生率的有意义的变化。	And it would cost $1 trillion a year or more – an incredibly expensive way to make no meaningful difference to a potential increase in flooding and droughts at the end of the century.
收入增长加速，财富主要靠挣（不管公不公平 ） ， 政治由中产阶级主宰，经济不平等也相当温和（即使种族和性别平等仍然大大落后 ） 。	Income growth accelerated, wealth was predominantly earned (justly or unjustly), politics became dominated by the middle class, and economic inequality was modest (even if race and gender equality remained a long way off).
作为回报，土耳其将帮助KRG建设输油管道基础工程，出口土耳其的油气将不必依赖伊拉克国有管道，后者控制在巴格达中央政府手中。	In return, Turkey is to help the KRG build pipeline infrastructure that will allow oil and gas to be exported to Turkey without relying on Iraq’s national pipeline, which is controlled by the central government in Baghdad.
20世纪七八十年代，林德贝克干预瑞典选举，援引微观经济学理论对抗社会民主，并警告说高税收和充分就业导致灾难。	During the 1970s and 1980s, Lindbeck intervened in Swedish elections, invoked microeconomic theory against social democracy, and warned that high taxation and full employment led to disaster.
在特朗普的种族民族主义圈子里影响甚巨的弗兰克·戈夫尼（Frank Gaffney）说穆斯林是“白蚁 ” ， 他们“掏空公民社会和其他制度的骨架 。 ”	Frank Gaffney, an influential figure in Trump’s ethnic nationalist circles, spoke of Muslims as “termites,” who “hollow out the structure of the civil society and other institutions.”
主要专注于和平和安全问题的NGO要少得多（大概只有几百家 ） ， 不过一些主要专注于人权的组织，比如人权观察组织（Human Rights Watch）和国际特赦组织（Amnesty International）在这方面也很活跃。	A much smaller number – a few hundred at best – work primarily on peace and security issues, though some primarily human rights-focused organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are influential here.
当时，人们重视欧洲一体化，因为它不仅不会带来任何事实上的主权损失；反而能够提供巨大的社会经济优势，从而允许其成员国最大限度地发挥国际影响力。	At the time, European integration was valued because it did not entail any de facto loss of sovereignty; on the contrary, the EU offered great socioeconomic advantages, enabling its members to maximize their international influence.
是的，在过去十年里，人们越来越多地使用全球治理标准 — — 这些标准主要是在美国发展起来的 — — 来评估世界各国和公司是怎样保护小投资者利益的。	Yes, over the last decade, there has been growing use of global governance standards, largely developed in the United States, to assess how countries and companies around the world protect minority investors.
这个观点的另一个含义就是中国储蓄的急剧上升在很大程度上是由中年中国人储蓄率的上升（而不是年轻人贷款率下降）所导致的。	Another implication of this view is that the steep rise in savings in China is largely driven by a rise in the savings rate of middle-aged Chinese (rather than a fall in the borrowing rate of the young).
美国的其他长期优势 — — 灵活性、再生能力、经济流动性、国际监管优势以及世界主要储备货币 — — 将继续保持。	And the country’s other longstanding advantages – flexibility, capacity for renewal, economic mobility, international regulatory strength, and the world’s main reserve currency – remain in place.
即便是双方最温和的领导人都无法就冲突的一连串核心问题达成和解：边界、定居点、耶路撒冷，还有1947~1948年间的巴勒斯坦难民以及后裔的安置问题。	Even the most moderate leaders on both sides could not agree on the core issues of the conflict: borders, settlements, Jerusalem, and the fate of 1947-1948 Palestinian refugees and their descendants.
而且要是仔细看看中国人对西藏骚乱和四川地震是如何反应的话，就可以发现切实迹象，也就是中国人正在接受更大程度的言论自由。	And when one looks more closely at how Chinese responded, both to the unrest in Tibet and the Sichuan earthquake, one sees tangible signs that the Chinese are embracing a greater degree of free speech.
巴塞罗纳－金融危机、信贷紧缩以及随之而来的经济下滑，已经严重损害了金融市场、金融机构以及交易商的信誉。	Barcelona – The financial crisis, credit crunch, and ensuing economic downturn have severely damaged the credibility of financial markets, institutions, and traders.
处理那些“大而不倒”企业/政府的问题当然重要，但相对于经济危机所造成的损失来说，为纳税人为救助银行而支付的直接成本其实不那么重要。	Fixing the “too big to fail” problem is certainly important, but the direct taxpayer costs of bank rescues were small change compared to the damage wreaked by the financial crisis.
在这方面，NPT要求所有签署方“在谈判时要真心实意地相信要在核武器竞赛的萌芽期就采取有效措施予以扼杀，也要采取有效措施核裁军化 。 ”	To this end, the treaty committed all signatories to “undertake negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.”
该管道由俄罗斯－德国－荷兰三国合资联营，但其中能源巨头俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司却独占51％的股份并因此牢牢掌握着主导权。	The pipeline has been established as a Russian-German-Dutch consortium, but it is the Russian energy giant Gazprom that is in the driver’s seat with 51% of the shares.
国际货币基金组织和七国集团国家的中央银行必须担当起作为最后手段的全球借款者的角色并提供大量的流动资金，迅速地并且不附加太多条件地支持新兴市场的货币。	The International Monetary Fund and the G7 countries’ central banks must act as global lenders of last resort and provide ample liquidity – quickly and with few strings attached – to support emerging markets’ currencies.
放眼未来，污垢动力燃料电池能够点亮边远村庄，让孩子们能够学习，而大型水源淡化工厂能够从海洋生产饮用水。	Looking forward, dirt-powered fuel cells could light remote villages so children can study, and large-scale water desalination plants may generate drinking water from the ocean.
今年早些时候，美国环境保护署（EPA）得出结论 ： “ 基于现有数据的证据采纳权重，2,4-D应被划为‘不太可能对人类产生致癌效果 ’ 。 ”	Earlier this year, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concluded that “based on weight of evidence consideration of the available data, 2,4-D would be classified as ‘Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans.’”
然而实际上，陈在进一步融入全球经济面前畏缩不前，拒绝对外国投资者开放台湾所有的经济领域，这本可以增强台湾的竞争力和效率。	Instead, Chen balked at further integration into the global economy, refusing to open all of Taiwan’s economic sectors to foreign participation, which would have strengthened Taiwan’s competitiveness and efficiency.
现在和当时一样，非洲政府、医疗服务提供商、制药企业和非政府组织之间的合作决定了抗击癌症能否取得成功。	Now, as then, success depends on coordination among African governments, health-service providers, drug makers, and non-governmental organizations.
德国新政府宣誓的那一天以来，很显然默克尔的招牌式策略 — — 通过将潜在批评者纳入内阁来消除批评已不再管用。	Since the day the new German government was sworn in, it has been clear that Merkel’s trademark tactic of neutralizing potential critics by including them in her cabinet would no longer work.
关键洞见是，当现有企业受到保护，怀揣新概念的新来者无法进入市场时，结果将是 — — 用哈耶克（Friedrich Hayek）的话说 — — 创新和对变化的世界的“适应”的损失。	The key insight is that when existing enterprises are protected from new market entrants bearing new ideas, the result will be less innovation and less “adaptation” to a changing world, to use Friedrich Hayek’sterm.
但要想确保高投票率，只有一个现实的选择：反腐运动领导者、大声批评克里姆林宫的阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexei Navalny ） 。	But there is only one real option to secure a large voter turnout: the anti-corruption campaigner and vocal Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
归根结底，朔伊布勒也明白自己提出的条件并不为政界所接受。 因此，朔伊布勒提出，无法满足其条件的国家 “ 在确保欧盟成员国资格的前提下，最终都应退出货币同盟 。 ”	After all, Schauble knows that the conditions he proposes would be politically unacceptable, so he says that any country unable to meet them “should, as a last resort, exit the monetary union, while being able to remain a member of the EU.”
如果我冒险猜测一下，我会说，作为一个社会，我们从信息时代技术中获得的好处被我们生活在前所未有地不平等的世界中所带来的嫉妒和怨气所中和了。	If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that, as a society, the benefits we have received from information-age technology have been neutralized by the envy and spite that results from living in a world that is ever more unequal.
保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker）在1980年代早期带领美联储应对猛烈通胀压力时就知道这一点。	Paul Volcker knew that when he led the charge against raging inflation in the early 1980s.
沙特同样也渴望遏制伊朗的威胁以及不断增长的“什叶派新月 ” 。 这一“什叶派新月”由于什叶派在伊拉克坐大已经向西转移，包括沙特王国的什叶派地区。	Saudi Arabia is just as eager to contain the Iranian threat and the growing “Shi’a crescent” that, with the empowerment of the Shi’a in Iraq, has moved westward to begin to include the Shi’a regions of the Kingdom.
这就是最近的世界经济论坛（WEF）阿布扎比会议所提出的问题。 这次会议集中讨论了信息革命所带来的三种潜在情景中的未来治理。	That is what the World Economic Forum (WEF) asked at a recent meeting in Abu Dhabi that focused on the future of governance under three potential scenarios arising from the ongoing information revolution.
只要看看Omar Barghouti、Ali Abunimah和其他运动发起人的声明，就知道他们恰恰最不希望订立两国协议。	One has only to read the declarations of Omar Barghouti, Ali Abunimah, and other promoters of the BDS movement to see that this solution is precisely what they do not want.
不幸的是，如果完全由委内瑞拉人民自行处理，镇压和极端化就不可能结束，因为在过去15年中，委内瑞拉人从未找到过走出困境的办法。	Unfortunately, none of this seems likely if left exclusively in the hands of Venezuelans, who have failed repeatedly over the past 15 years to find solutions to their dilemmas.
1995年，我在五角大楼供职，当时中国刚开始建设美济礁。 美济礁是菲律宾宣布主权的岛礁，距离菲律宾海岸比中国海岸更近。	In 1995, when I was serving in the Pentagon, China began building structures on Mischief Reef, which is claimed by the Philippines and lies much closer to its shores than to China’s.
阿富汗的农民素来置强迫清除鸦片以及改换作物的激励于不顾而种植罂粟。 如此还会为他们提供一种受到法律调整的选择，而且最终会对海洛因交易产生影响。	It would also provide Afghan peasants, who have been growing poppy despite forced eradication of the plant and incentives to change crops, with an option that is regulated by law and that, in time, could have an impact on the heroin trade.
迎接气候变化的挑战需要将减排与为大部分人创造更美好的未来以及提供依靠体面的工作维生的机会融合起来的新的发展模式。	Meeting the challenge of climate change will require a new development model that combines reduced emissions with a better future for the vast majority of people and the opportunity to earn a living in a decent job.
毕竟，欧盟（包括由17个成员国组成的欧元区）仍只是国家的组合，各国在经济、金融和社会条件诸方面存在巨大差异。	After all, the European Union (including the eurozone’s 17 members) remains a collective of nation-states with notable divergences in economic, financial, and social conditions.
华盛顿—美国宪法的起草者做出了根本性的选择：他们应该将权力集中在一个人手里，还是设计一套政治制度，让决策影响力更加分散？	WASHINGTON, DC – The drafters of the United States Constitution had to make a fundamental choice: Should they concentrate power in the hands of one man, or devise a political system in which decision-making influence would be more diffuse?
欧洲一体化越深入，国家政府就越无力实施再分配，因为个人、公司和就业岗位必定会离开高税率国家，在法国等国家这一现象已经出现了。	The more deeply integrated Europe becomes, the less capacity national governments have for redistribution, because individuals, companies, and jobs can simply leave countries with higher tax rates, as has already happened in countries like France.
欧盟明确规定只要 “ [ 转基因生物]成分属无意进入产品且含量小于0.9 % ” ，食品就可以贴上有机标签。	EU rules are clear that food may be labeled as organic as long as “the ingredients containing [genetically modified organisms] entered the products unintentionally” and amount to less than 0.9% of their content.
在受到贸易战威胁的严峻国际形势下，中国应该致力于进一步提高已经取得成功的城市群的升级发展，特别是粤港澳大湾区。	China should also work to foster even faster growth in urban clusters that are already successful.
几乎同时在瓦伦西亚一年一度的火节庆典上，出现了装扮成邪恶女校长的默克尔将“灭绝女王安吉拉十诫”亲手交给西班牙政府首脑及各部部长。	In Valencia at around the same time, on the occasion of the annual Fallas celebration, there was Merkel as an evil headmistress delivering to the head of the Spanish government and his ministers “The Ten Commandments of Angela the Exterminator.”
它提供的不是可信的汇率升值压力抵抗力（这是它的初衷 ） ， 而是引发了彻底的反转，贬值预期开始在外汇市场上愈演愈烈。	Instead of providing credible resistance to upward pressure on the exchange rate, as intended, it triggered an outright reversal, with depreciation expectations beginning to creep into foreign-exchange markets.
事实与认识之间的不对等反映了双边联盟衰退的根本原因：双方都不充分领会持续结盟的必要性，也不了解为了确保安全所必须承担的政治成本。	This disparity between fact and perception reflects the root cause of the decay in the bilateral alliance: neither country fully appreciates the ongoing need for the alliance, or the political costs that it must bear for the sake of security.
移出名单的标准 — — 过去六个月中没有恐怖活动或与恐怖组织合作 — — 足够灵活，因此可以用来作为现成的外交谈判筹码。	The standard for de-designation – no acts of terrorism or cooperation with terrorist groups in the past six months – is flexible enough that removal from the list can readily be used as a diplomatic bargaining chip.
他们认为稳健复苏和就业创造会从天上掉下来；因此，欧洲非但没有迎来可持续增长，反而进入了一种新模式 — — “可持续停滞 ” 。	They assume that robust recovery and job creation will emerge simply of their own accord; as a result, rather than enjoying sustainable growth, Europe is heading toward a model for which a new term – “sustainable stagnation” – might be appropriate.
令人悲哀的是，世界很多地方的男男女女似乎并没有摆脱圣经中“以眼还眼”的训诫，他们渴望对犯罪行为施以惩罚。	Sadly, in many places in the world, it seems that men and women have not advanced beyond the biblical admonition of “an eye for an eye” in their yearning for retribution.
事实上，如果官方融资地位较低，那么它相当于在为私人债权人提供更大的损失缓冲垫，从而更多地拯救私人债权人。	Indeed, if official funding were junior, it would be providing a larger cushion to private creditors – and thus bailing them out to an even greater extent.
首先是遗漏错误（errors of omission ） — —共识中的盲点让经济学家难以看到未来的麻烦。	First, there are errors of omission – cases in which blind spots in the consensus prevent economists from being able to see troubles looming ahead.
世界银行计划于明年春天发布的个人银行账户最新统计数据预计将会表明越来越多的人开始持有银行或其他正式金融机构的账户。	The World Bank’s latest figures on individuals’ bank accounts, to be released next spring, are expected to show that the number of people holding accounts at banks or other formal financial institutions has grown.
20世纪60年代，华沙美中双边会谈一直没有取得进展，直到尼克松及其国务卿基辛格另辟蹊径，在巴基斯坦的协助下与中国开展了更加直接的交流。	The bilateral US-China talks in Warsaw in the 1960’s were fruitless until Richard M. Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger opened a different, more direct discussion through the auspices of Pakistan.
处理和储存信息的成本在最近几年大大下降了，因此，拥有规模优势的企业，运营成本会更低，而随着用户的倍增，利润也会迅速上升（谷歌和Facebook都是很好的例子 ） 。	Because the cost of processing and storing information has declined in recent years, a firm with a size advantage has smaller operating costs, and profits rise rapidly as the number of users multiplies (Google and Facebook are good examples).
除非投资者认为美联储会永远买入债券不停歇，否则美联储减少购买量的新闻应该只会对他们关于美联储的最周债券存量持有量的预期产生温和影响。	Unless investors thought the Fed was going to buy bonds forever, news about a reduction in Fed purchases should have had only a mild effect on their expectations of the eventual stock of bonds the Fed would hold.
三十多年来，中国TFP平均增长率为4 % ， 并且可能在未来十年有所下降，因此这一情景可能无法实现。	Given that China’s TFP growth has averaged 4% for more than 30 years, and is likely to slow in the coming decade, this scenario is improbable.
而且，通货膨胀在实行价格管制的情况下仍然超过200 % ， 因为央行货币化的财政赤字超过GDP的20 % 。	And, despite price controls, inflation is above 200%, because the central bank monetizes a fiscal deficit of more than 20% of GDP.
法律像经济一样，长期以来一直扮演着政治的替身，这当中体现出一种观点，那就是因为别无选择必须实行自由民主和自由市场，所以政治可以与技术统治相等同。	The law – like the economy – has served as a stand-in for politics for too long, embodying the idea that, with no alternative to liberal democracy and free markets, politics can be reduced to technocracy.
第二个改变更加不明显，但却更为重要：从2002年巴西总统路易斯 伊纳西奥 卢拉 达席尔瓦胜选后所带来的政治稳定。	The second change is both less obvious and more important: the political stability that came with the election in 2002 of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
逊尼派军事组织博科圣地（Boko Haram）因为在4月份 劫持276名女生并强迫她们嫁给其成员而在全世界臭名昭著。 该组织扰乱尼日利亚已有多年。	The Sunni militant group Boko Haram, known internationally for abducting 276 schoolgirls in April and forcing them to marry its members, has been wreaking havoc in Nigeria for years.
这场起义结束了一个腐败的政权，把权力 — — 在自由公正的选举之后 — — 交给了乌克兰有史以来最有改革思维的政府。	That uprising ended a corrupt regime and brought to power – after a free and fair election – what appears to be Ukraine’s most reform-minded government ever.
可能绝大部分的非洲人至少可以在紧急情况下能找到手机并使用手机 - 或是他们自己的手机，或是朋友的手机，或是商业性的电话服务处。	Probably a significant majority of Africans have at least emergency access to a cell phone, either their own, a neighbor’s, or one at a commercial kiosk.
事实上，尽管做出了就成立新开发银行展开“正式谈判”的承诺，但该银行的规模和出资份额等问题仍有待解决。	In fact, despite a commitment to launch “formal negotiations” to establish the bank, disagreements about the size and shares of the bank’s capital have not been resolved.
原因很简单：长期以来，美国人一直对“大政府”持狐疑态度，这演变为一种政治自恨（self-hatred ） ， 不管是决策者还是公民，都相信政府不管政，才是最好的。	The reason is simple: Americans’ longstanding suspicion of “big government” morphed into a kind of political self-hatred, with policymakers and citizens alike led to believe that government is at its best when it does not govern.
接下来的步骤更为具有挑衅性。 这包括修改标准工作合同以及要求邀请所有的工人在罢工八天以后都参加投票。	Even more provocative are the next steps: a plan to revamp the standard work contract and to require that all workers be invited to vote after eight days of a strike.
我不想给人留下消极的印象，但我不知道什么时候这样的日子才能结束 ， ” 在女儿玛丽亚·冈萨雷斯·萨格拉里奥·弗洛雷斯失踪并被杀十八年后的2016年7月3日，墨西哥华雷斯的保拉·弗洛雷斯如是说。	I don’t want to be negative, but I don’t know when this will stop,” said Paula Flores of Juárez, Mexico, on July 3, 2016, 18 years after the disappearance and murder of her daughter, María Sagrario González Flores.
美国疾病控制中心最近发布了一份报告，估算美国有40％的人肥胖（定义为身体质量指数BMI为30或更高 ） ， 其中包括20.6％的12~19岁青少年。	Recently, the US Centers for Disease Control estimated that a stunning 40% of all Americans are obese (defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher), a figure that includes 20.6% of adolescents (12-19 years old).
上述事件的时机非常尴尬，恰恰发生在荷兰国王威廉·亚历山大准备出访俄罗斯庆祝所谓“荷兰—俄罗斯年”两国友好关系之前。	The timing of all of this was awkward. The Dutch king, Willem Alexander, was about to visit Russia to celebrate the two countries’ friendly relations in the so-called “Netherlands-Russia Year.”
拜大宗商品价格下跌和美国量化宽松结束所赐，整个地区的经济增长都有所下降，但哥伦比亚的经济实际上还有所加速。	As growth slows throughout the region, owing to falling commodity prices and the end of quantitative easing in the United States, Colombia’s economy is actually accelerating.
非洲力量采取了“以交易为中心的方针 ” ， 建立团队理顺“东道国政府、私人部门和出资人”之间的激励。	Power Africa takes a “transaction-centered approach,” creating teams to align incentives among “host governments, the private sector, and donors.”
此外在构建一个切实可行的战略时，日本必须优先考虑深化与诸如印度、印尼和韩国等亚洲民主国家的盟友关系。	In constructing a viable strategy, deepening Japan’s partnerships with Asia’s great democracies – India, Indonesia, and South Korea – must be a priority.
曾被凯末尔世俗国家压制的风俗习惯（比方说妇女在公共场所佩戴头巾）重新出现是因为土耳其农村民众的影响力更大。	Customs that the Kemalist secular state suppressed, such as women’s use of headscarves in public places, have reappeared, because rural Turks have more influence.
考虑到由欧洲主权债务和银行危机所引发的全球威胁，巩固欧洲银行系统和鼓励财政整合的措施在最近墨西哥洛斯卡沃斯（Los Cabos）举行的G20峰会上得到了推进。	Given the global menace posed by Europe’s sovereign-debt and banking crises, measures to strengthen the European banking system and encourage fiscal integration gained some momentum at the recent G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico.
他的敌人不仅仅是穆斯林，还有西方那些自由派精英及其子女，这些人都在利用“文化多元主义”和“文化马克思主义”来毁灭欧洲。	His enemies are not just Muslims, but the liberal Western elites, and their children, who were destroying Europe from within through “multiculturalism” and “cultural Marxism.”
但特朗普不太可能权衡将家庭成员塞进内部圈子的利弊，尤其因为其自身经历使然：自从他的父亲带他进入家族企业，他就从来没有在其他地方做过任何工作。	Yet Trump is unlikely to weigh the pros and cons of stacking his inner circle with family members, not least because of his own experience: ever since his father brought him into the family business, he has never worked anywhere else.
显然，近期趋势 — — 失业率的大幅下降以及相当漂亮并且还在加速的经济增长 — — 让克鲁格曼的宏观经济诊断令人质疑（但他的进步政治学除外 ） 。	Obviously, recent trends – a significant decline in the unemployment rate and a reasonably high and accelerating rate of economic growth – cast doubt on Krugman’s macroeconomic diagnosis (though not on his progressive politics).
互联网不仅将在未来数年中位中国创造经济动力；它还将有助于基于固定资产投资和廉价劳动力的不可持续的增长模式的转变。	The Internet will not only create economic momentum for China in the years ahead; it will help to transform an unsustainable growth model based on fixed investment and cheap labor.
澳大利亚前外长加雷斯·埃文斯已经认为逮捕令是“强有力的外交工具 ” ， 《华盛顿邮报》则表示可以把逮捕令当成“和巴希尔先生以及他的中国和阿拉伯盟友讨价还价的筹码”来使用。	Gareth Evans, a former Australian Foreign Minister, has called it “a powerful diplomatic tool,” while the Washington Post has called for the warrant to be used “as a bargaining chip with Mr. Bashir and his Chinese and Arab allies.”
据全球经济指标官方“仲裁官 ” — —国际货币基金组织（IMF ） ， 中国经济贡献世界GDP的17.3 % （ 以购买力平价衡量 ） 。	According to the International Monetary Fund – the official arbiter of global economic metrics – the Chinese economy accounts for 17.3% of world GDP (measured on a purchasing-power-parity basis).
就算世界实现巴黎气候协定将全球气温升高限制在比前工业化水平高2℃的目标，因为极端天气现在已经成为新常态，能否适应依然至关重要。	Even if the world meets the Paris climate agreement’s target of limiting the increase in global temperature to 2º Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels, adaptation will still be critical, because climate extremes are now the new normal.
对于科恩来说，一个积极的进展就是第二轮公民复决很有可能将会唤起人们记住爱尔兰加入欧盟以来在经济领域获得的好处。	One positive development for Cowen is that a second referendum would most likely bring back into play the significant economic dimension of Ireland’s EU membership.
但是，一些国家仍有提高某些商品的关税的空间，如果它们能开发可再生能源资源，加强保护措施，能源出口也可能增长。	Still, some countries may have room to raise tariffs on certain consumer goods. And if they develop renewable-energy sources and step up their conservation efforts, they can increase their energy exports.
在欧洲气候基金会对特定化学产品的试点研究中，来自麦肯锡的专家确认二氧化碳排放量存在进一步减少50-75%的潜力。	In a pilot study on specific chemical products for the European Climate Foundation, experts from McKinsey identified the potential for a further 50-75% reduction in CO2 emissions.
从尼日利亚到印度，社区在卡达斯塔基金会的帮助下，御用手持设备丈量土地，用硬证据支持土地权利主张，从而实现土地所有权的逐步强化。	Together with the Cadasta Foundation, communities from Nigeria to India are using hand-held devices to map property and support land claims with hard evidence, thereby allowing for incremental strengthening of tenure.
在最初两年，欧盟每年至少应该为寻求庇护者提供人均15,000欧元以帮助他们覆盖住房、医疗和教育成本 — — 也让成员国感到接受难民是一件有吸引力的事。	The EU should provide €15,000 ($16,800) per asylum-seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, health care, and education costs – and to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states.
事实上，朝鲜的大部分研发活动，包括对核裂变材料的浓缩活动，都是在外部调查者难以进入的秘密设施中进行的。	Indeed, most of North Korea’s R&D, not least its enrichment of fissile materials, occurs in secret facilities inaccessible to outside inspectors.
西方的那套冷战对抗和遏制政策必将遭到中国人的强烈反抗, 而中国的全球杠杆作用（尤其在金融方面）也已强大到无法被忽视。	A Cold War-style confrontation and containment policy from the West will be met with strong resistance from the Chinese, whose global leverage, particularly in finance, cannot be ignored.
时任美国财政部长的安德鲁·梅林（Andrew Mellen）曾主张将工人、农场主、证券和房地产债务清盘 ， “ 把脓水挤掉 ” 。	Andrew Mellon, the United States Treasury Secretary at the time, talked about liquidating workers, farmers, stocks, and real estate in order “to purge the rottenness out of the system.”
日内瓦—近三十年前，柏林墙倒塌，代表着国家从全球经济中撤退的最高潮，也标志着社会主义经济学在全世界的一败涂地。	GENEVA – The fall of the Berlin Wall almost 30 years ago represented a high-water mark in the retreat of the state from the global economy, signaling a defeat of socialist economics virtually worldwide.
对于高储蓄率的传统解释（缺乏社会安全网，有限的公共服务，人口老化，消费信贷的不发达）只是这一迷局的其中一部分。	Traditional explanations for the high savings rate (lack of a social safety net, limited public services, aging of the population, underdevelopment of consumer finance, etc.) are only part of the puzzle.
但那些对中国标志性GDP增长的肤浅成见依然存在，因此下降25%至年均7~8%的放缓被认为是预示着当代世界最伟大增长神话的终结。	Yet a superficial fixation on China’s headline GDP growth persists, so that a 25% deceleration, to a 7-8% annual rate, is perceived as somehow heralding the end of the modern world’s greatest development story.
一年前，欧洲领导人们就承认如果没有经济增长，希腊的状况便无法得到恢复，并且只是通过紧缩政策经济不会得到增长。	A year ago, European leaders acknowledged that Greece could not recover without growth, and that growth could not be achieved by austerity alone.
有见及此，中国领导人必须将金融部门改革和提高公共部门积极性相结合,以增加与高潜在回报部门资金的联系渠道。	Given this, China’s leaders must use a combination of financial-sector reforms and improved public-sector incentives to increase access to capital in sectors with high potential rates of return.
2010年，乔弗里·韦斯特（Geoffrey West）与一群研究者一起发现，不少社会经济指标 — — 既有积极指标，也有消极指标 — — 随地方人口的增加而增加。	In 2010, Geoffrey West, together with a team of researchers, discovered that several socioeconomic measures – both positive and negative – increase with the size of the local population.
而且事实上，尽管纳赛尔具有亲苏倾向，直到1967年与以色列的灾难性战争冻结埃美关系之前，埃及一直是美国对外援助的最大接受国。	And, in fact, despite Nasser’s pro-Soviet bent, Egypt was the largest recipient of American foreign aid until its disastrous war with Israel in 1967 froze relations.
十余年来，金融市场给了直到2014年仍担任总理的埃尔多安疑罪从无的信任，并以宽松的信贷条件助推土耳其经济。	For more than a decade, financial markets gave Erdoğan, who was Prime Minister until 2014, the benefit of the doubt and supplied the Turkish economy with easy credit.
一开始，俄罗斯的反应是冷淡，这主要是因为，考虑到以色列日益成为中东的一股能源力量，土以关系破冰妨碍了俄罗斯增加对土能源出口的计划。	At first, Russia’s reaction was lukewarm, largely because, given Israel’s role as a rising energy power in the Middle East, the reconciliation jeopardized Russia’s plans of boosting energy exports to Turkey.
国际货币基金组织长久以来一直都是左派与右派的替罪羊 — — 为前者替罪，是因为该组织将工作重点聚焦在财政廉洁与经济正统上；而为后者代罪，则是因为该组织的作用在于救援那些负债累累的国家。	The IMF has long been a whipping boy for both left and right – the former because of the Fund’s emphasis on fiscal rectitude and economic orthodoxy, and the latter because of its role in bailing out indebted nations.
登山者将在冰川逐渐融化的喜马拉雅山上拉起横幅标语，而在遭到气候变化威胁的澳大利亚大堡礁，潜水员们也将有所宣示。	There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas, where the glaciers are melting, and scuba divers at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which is threatened by climate change.
日本是世界上唯一一个受到如此限制的国家 — — 之所以如此，不但是要防止军国主义复燃，也是要惩罚日本战时政府的政策 — — 继续遵守这样的限制是不现实的。	Japan is the only country in the world bound by such restrictions – imposed not just to prevent a militarist revival, but also to punish Japan for its wartime government’s policies – and continued adherence to them is unrealistic.
反之，特朗普说他不会动社会安全，将废除奥巴马医保用新政策取而代之，并提高政府支出的效率和效果（尽管他并没有提出具体做法 ） 。	By contrast, Trump says he will leave Social Security as is, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make government spending more efficient and effective (though here he has not been specific).
今天，太阳能和风能仅能满足我们一小部分能源需求 — — 风能仅占总需求的0.7 % ， 而太阳能仅占0.1 % 。	Today, we produce only a small fraction of the energy that we need from solar and wind – 0.7% from wind and just 0.1% from solar.
一个以民主价值观和无与伦比的人类自由承诺而闻名于世的国家竟然堕落到去杀害无辜的男人、妇女和儿童，这种行径是非常可耻的。	It is shameful that a country known for its democratic values and its unparalleled commitment to human freedom should stoop so low as to kill innocent men, women, and children.
而特朗普则发推特说 ： “ 我惊讶地发现哈雷竟然是所有企业里第一个举白旗的 。 ” 并许下一个无法兑现的承诺 ： “ . . . . . .	Trump then took to Twitter to say that he was, “Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag.”
因此只是针对中国或任何其他国家而不去解决低储蓄的根本问题就像用手去挤一个灌了点水的气球：水只是跑到另一端而已。	Consequently, going after China, or any other country, without addressing the root cause of low saving is like squeezing one end of a water balloon: the water simply sloshes to the other end.
"由""无边界记者组织""发布的2003年度《世界新闻自由报告》将中国排在全部166个国家的中的第161位，大致位于伊朗和北朝鲜之间。"	The 2003 World Press Freedom report put out by the group Reporters without Borders ranks China 161st among 166 nations, somewhere between Iran and North Korea.
继承了决定其国民性的帝国传统的俄罗斯正在重新树立其在中东的地位和作用，堪与帝俄时代和斯大林时代相媲美。	Heir to an imperial tradition that has shaped its national identity, Russia is resuming in the Middle East a role and status more in tune with the one it had from the Czarist era to Soviet times.
问题在于缺乏可靠数据可以让保护特定物种的必要性显得抽象和不那么紧迫，削弱政府抵制其他更直接需求的能力，特别当牵涉到对相关人员的生计予以保护。	The problem is that the absence of reliable data can make the need to protect a species seem more abstract and less urgent, weakening governments’ capacity to resist other, more immediate demands, especially the need to protect relevant livelihoods.
在最近几十年中，中国利用国际社会对缅甸的孤立来为自己的战略利益服务，兴建了大量连接本国西部地区和印度洋的铁路，港口和输油管道。	In recent decades, China took advantage of the international community’s shunning of Burma to secure its own strategic interests, building highways, railways, ports, and pipelines that connect southern and western China to the Indian Ocean.
2014年11月，共和党完全控制了国会，压倒性的传统智慧认为奥巴马政府在其最后两年中不会有多少作为。	With the Republicans having taken full control of the Congress in November 2014, the overwhelming conventional wisdom was that the administration would be blocked from accomplishing much in its final two years.
简而言之，特朗普总统将联邦的教育，培训，环境，民用科学，外交，住房，营养以及其他民众急需的优先事项都排除在外了。	Trump would, in short, gut the federal programs for education, training, the environment, civilian science, diplomacy, housing, nutrition, and other urgent civilian priorities.
格鲁吉亚政府由于没有西方的明确的支持，可能会同意这一交易。 摩尔多瓦的天然气供应在元旦被切断，刚刚同意了类似的交易。	The Georgian government, without clear support from the West, may yet agree to such a deal, something that Moldova, which saw its gas cut off on January 1st, has just done.
自从2004年安全部队在卡米什利东北小镇杀害数十名手无寸铁的示威者以来，叙利亚库尔德人反抗执政40余年的阿萨德家族复兴党独裁统治的斗争就变得尤为艰苦。	For Syria’s Kurds, the struggle against more than four decades of the Assad family’s Ba’athist dictatorship became particularly harsh after 2004, when security forces killed dozens of unarmed protesters in the northeastern town of Qamishli.
马来西亚在减小不同族群之间的收入差距方面也成效卓越。 其做法不是削减高收入族群而是为低收入族群增收。	Malaysia has succeeded in markedly reducing the income divides that separated various ethnic groups, not by bringing the top down, but by bringing the bottom up.
而这笔债务是欧元区中最大的一笔 — — 大约2万亿欧元，或相当于其GDP的120 % — —这意味着意大利只能被帮助，不能被救助。	That debt is the largest in the eurozone – at roughly €2 trillion ($2.6 trillion), or 120% of the country’s GDP – which means that Italy can be helped, but not rescued.
其秘鲁人民革命同盟由德拉托尔在二十世纪二十年代创立，是该地区历史最长、最为与时代格格不入的民粹主义组织。	His APRA party, founded by Victor Raúl Haya de la Torre in the 1920’s, is one of the region’s oldest and most anachronistic populist organizations.
但欧洲仍把自己当作世界中心，以“传播文明”为名将对手送往非洲和亚洲，而完全没有注意到新世界的惨痛教训。	But a Europe that considered itself the center of the world, exporting its rivalries to Africa and Asia in the name of a “civilizing mission,” was utterly incapable of paying attention to the harsh lessons of the New World.
但是，由于沙特也想让叙利亚包括在阿卜杜拉国王的地区和平计划之中，以及美国计划在十一月举行地区和平会议，因此，沙特并不寻求与阿萨德无休止地对抗。	But, as the Saudis also want Syria to be included in King Abdullah’s regional peace plan, and with the US planning to hold a regional peace conference in November, they are not looking for an open-ended confrontation with Assad.
但是，尽管主要经济体采取了一些结构性改革以改善潜在增长，变化的速度远远赶不上潜力最大化的要求，规模也过于温和。	Yet, while major economies pursue some structural reforms to improve potential growth, the pace of change is much slower, and its scope more modest, than is needed to maximize potential.
我们甚至被告知，在今后几十年内，我们需要以前所未有的规模从空气中去除二氧化碳，而实现这一目标需要依赖完全未经测试的技术。	We are even told that within a few decades, we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on an unprecedented scale, with totally untested technology.
相反，在美国，有偏见的新闻报道，特别是社交媒体上的报道，对选民产生了强大的影响，也让政治极化达到了前所未有的程度。	In the United States, by contrast, biased news stories, especially on social media, appear to be having a powerful effect on voters, and have propelled political polarization to unprecedented levels.
如果央行在相当长的一段时间内坚持不升息，资产泡沫可能会继续发展 — — 不仅仅是股市和房地产市场，还包括（比如）虚拟货币 — — 导致另一场金融危机。	If central banks continue to postpone interest-rate increases for much longer, asset bubbles might develop – not just in the stock and housing markets, but also in, say, virtual currencies – leading to another financial crisis.
文在寅会对特朗普施加怎样的压力，让他采取不同的朝鲜方针，还有待观察，但有一点是确定的：特朗普在韩国人中间的地位不会让文在寅闭嘴。	How hard Moon presses Trump for a different approach to North Korea remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Trump’s standing among South Koreans won’t be what keeps Moon mum.
加州大学洛杉矶分校学者阿南亚·罗伊（Ananya Roy）指出，绝对贫困人群被剥夺了机会和改变地位的途径。	As the UCLA scholar Ananya Roy points out, people in absolute poverty are deprived of both the opportunities and the means to change their status.
如果欧盟能成功解决英国退欧问题，就可以抓住乌克兰和东南欧国家的投资机会，并以此来补充其政治资本及再次提高生产率。	If it succeeds in this, it can pursue investment opportunities in Ukraine and southeast Europe that stand to replenish its political capital and renew its productivity growth.
结果是史上最巨额的纳税人支持贷款，贷款条件为希腊追求严格的紧缩措施，以至于其公民损失了四分之一的收入，导致无从偿付私人或公共债务。	The result was the largest taxpayer-backed loan in history, provided on the condition that Greece pursue such strict austerity that its citizens have lost one-quarter of their incomes, making it impossible to repay private or public debts.
上海—近几年来，中国经济的运行轨迹不可不谓引人注目：从打破纪录的增长发动机沦为了重大全球风险，至少在某些人眼里是如此。	SHANGHAI – China’s economy has followed a remarkable course in recent years: from record-breaking powerhouse to major global risk, at least in the eyes of some.
这些又因为市场、投资者和消费者对于欧元取代各自国家的货币将作何反应的战略上的不确定性而变得更加复杂。	This was compounded by strategic uncertainty related to how markets, investors and consumers would react to the replacement of national currencies with the Euro.
人们只是希望此举能聊表慰藉，并给予那些与刘晓波志同道合的中国人以道义上的鼓舞；但对于那些笃信当前中国民族主义正统思想的人士而言，此举不太可能令其受到震动。	One hopes that this will lend comfort to him, and give a moral boost to Chinese who share his views. But it is unlikely to impress those who believe in the current orthodoxy of Chinese nationalism.
除了俄罗斯掌握的核武库以及作为联合国安理会常任理事国所享有的否决权外，其战略影响力的基础其实相对薄弱。	Aside from Russia’s nuclear arsenal and the veto power that it enjoys as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, its foundation of strategic influence is weak.
因此，金融市场对中国的重要性甚至比美国和欧洲还要高，并且有清晰的信号表明中国的投资生产率在快速下降。	Financial markets are thus even more important for China than for the US or Europe, and there are clear signs that the productivity of investment has been declining rapidly in China.
一个国家的国内政治经济制度改革与加入欧盟和北约通常都是相随而行的，因为选民们为了争取成员国资格往往愿意承受一些改革的阵痛。	Reform of a country’s political and economic institutions and its accession to the EU and NATO usually go hand in hand, because the prospect of membership makes painful decisions electorally acceptable.
2004年至2008年期间，曾长期以未来之国著称的巴西 — — “一直都是也永远都会是 ” — —其GDP年增长率为5.5 % 。	In 2004-2008, Brazil, which had been perennially known as the country of the future – as in “always has been and always will be” – recorded 5.5% annual average GDP growth.
媒体和国际货币基金组织（IMF）和其他机构的官方报告严重警告美联储的首次动作对金融市场和其他经济体的影响。	The media and official publications from the International Monetary Fund and other institutions have raised dire warnings about the impact of the Fed’s first move on financial markets and other economies.
在过去十几年中，女生在大学生中的比例从36%增至57 % ， 从1993年的不到15000人增加到2010年的436000人。	Their share of total college enrollment has increased from 36% to 57% over the last couple of decades, rising from less than 15,000 in 1993 to 436,000 in 2010.
这一趋势的受益者积累了足够的政治影响力来维持现状，凸显出在理解政策反应及其缺位的问题中受到太少关注的分配问题。	The beneficiaries of these trends may have accumulated enough political influence to maintain the status quo, highlighting distributional issues that have generally received too little attention in understanding policy responses or their absence.
十九世纪有记录以来最炎热的年份是2005、2010和2014，而去年的纪录几乎肯定会在今年被再次打破。	The hottest years since record-keeping began in the nineteenth century were 2005, 2010, and 2014, and last year’s record will almost certainly be broken again this year.
在这样的环境下，毫不奇怪普通公民会对未来深感不确定，对政府没有保护他们免受全球化副作用伤害深感失望。	In this context, it is not surprising that ordinary citizens feel uncertain about the future and frustrated with their governments, which have so far failed to protect them from globalization’s fallout.
此类政策给莫斯科赫尔辛基集团带来了沉重的打击，因为该机构被迫选择失去其大部分资金，进而解雇大部分员工。	Such policies have hit the Moscow Helsinki Group hard, because it was forced to choose losing much of its funding and, in turn, its staff.
这里的要点不是要抛弃经济学的伟大成就于不顾，而是要创造我们所谓的“人文经济学 ” ， 即让每个学科都保持自身独特的品质。	The point is not to abandon the great achievements of economics, but to create what we call a “humanomics,” which allows each discipline to keep its own distinctive qualities.
而且，像新闻主笔急于提醒我们的那样，在世界金融体系在次级抵押贷款危机下岌岌可危以及美国进入衰退的时候，本回合失败的负面影响尤其巨大。	And, as the editorialists hasten to remind us, the downside is especially large at a time when the world’s financial system is reeling under the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the United States is entering a recession.
所谓的买春法规定购买性服务为犯罪（但出卖性服务非罪 ） ， 瑞典、挪威、冰岛和北爱尔兰都已经实施了该法。	The so-called Sex Buyer Law, criminalizing the purchase, though not the sale, of sexual services has been implemented in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Northern Ireland.
全球金融体系在2008年近乎崩溃后触发的大幅衰退几乎让每个人都猝不及防，包括那些原本被认为最有能力去预见其降临的专家。	The deep recession that followed the near-collapse of the global financial system in 2008 caught nearly everyone by surprise – including the experts who were presumably the best equipped to see it coming.
最关键的是，报告呼吁加强全球金融安全网，以确保各国针对资本流过度波动和自我实现的金融市场恐慌做好准备。	Most crucially, the report calls for an enhanced global financial safety net to ensure that countries are well protected against excessive capital-flow volatility and self-fulfilling financial market panics.
与此同时，极端分裂已经成为其任期内的政治标志， 叙利亚、黎巴嫩和加沙地带潜在战争的战鼓声更是震耳欲聋。	At the same time, extreme divisiveness has become a political hallmark of his tenure, and the drumbeat of potential war in Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza has grown deafening.
农业是主要经济活动，主要分布在广袤的尼日尔河内陆三角洲，这里也是众多部落的大本营，包括以雕塑和建筑著称的多贡族（Dogon ） 。	Agriculture is the main economic activity, notably in the vast internal delta of the Niger River, home to many tribes, including the Dogon, a people remarkable for their sculpture and architecture.
但是，在一个普京式的政权中，政府决定了谁可以称为候选人，网络摄像头根本就是一场闹剧，不能让任何人害怕。	But, in a regime like Vladimir Putin’s, where the government decides who may be a candidate, the webcams would be farcical were they not also so intimidating.
事实上，从1965年到1990年，阿根廷的实质人均GDP下降了15 % ， 而这25年期间亚洲某些经济体却增长了5倍。	In fact, real GDP per capita declined 15% over the 25-year period from 1965 to 1990 – a period that saw some Asian economies quintuple in size.
一些人认为安理会授权是必不可少的绝对条件，也有人认为在没有授权的情况下出于权宜之计进行人道主义干预可以成为“严格定义的例外情形 ” 。	Some argued for an absolute requirement of Security Council authorization, while others recognized an imperative to contemplate humanitarian intervention without such authorization in “very narrowly defined exceptional cases.”
弗里德曼说，公司应该“赚尽可能多的钱，与此同时要遵守社会的基本规则，既包括法律中写的规则，也包括世俗伦理规则 。 ”	In his words, companies should “make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.”
但发达国家和新兴经济体的结构改革都远低于最优水平，因为结构改革的成本和混乱是前置的，而收益要到中期和长期才能显现。	But such reforms are occurring at suboptimal rates in both advanced and emerging economies, because all of the costs and dislocations are frontloaded, while the benefits occur over the medium and long term.
经济增长模式、地缘政治局势、实现人类团结的社会契约、以及地球生态系统都在经历彻底而同时的变革，让人感到焦虑，也让很多地方陷入了动荡。	Economic growth patterns, the geopolitical landscape, the social contract that binds people together, and our planet’s ecosystem are all undergoing radical, simultaneous transformations, generating anxiety and, in many places, turmoil.
尽管经济萧条，伊朗仍然好斗不已，通过其黎巴嫩代理人真主党发动了至少一次针对以色列的成功的无人机空袭，最近，据说还发动了网络袭击。	Amidst a crumbling economy, the country remains belligerent, using its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, to launch at least one successful drone flight above Israel and reportedly initiating recent cyber attacks.
相反在中国，尽管自从毛泽东主义消亡以来，人们获得了许多的个人自由，但是他们并不能自由地建立任何不是受到共产党控制的组织。	In China, by contrast, while individuals have regained many personal freedoms since the death of Maoism, they are not free to organize anything that is not controlled by the Communist Party.
的确，巴勒斯坦权力机构在困难的情况下执政，但是，又有哪一个新的解放运动在最终必须执政管理的时候不是面临严重的挑战呢？	To be sure, the new Palestinian Authority (PA) took power under difficult conditions, but which new liberation movement does not face serious challenges when it finally must govern?
哥本哈根—尽管寿命预期有了提高、教育更加普及、贫困和饥饿率也有所下降，但世界在改善人民生活质量方面仍有很长的路要走。	COPENHAGEN – Despite gains in life expectancy, expanded access to education, and lower rates of poverty and hunger, the world has a long way to go to improve the quality of people’s lives.
修正教育并非一两天就能完成的事情 — — 自20世纪70年代的福特开始，历任美国总统都呼吁进行教育改革，但收效甚微。	There are no easy and quick fixes to education – every US president since Gerald Ford in the mid-1970’s has called for educational reforms, with little effect.
我已与双方领导人进行了长时间的讨论（其中既包括单独讨论，也包括双方都在场的讨论 ） ， 我向他们说明：塞浦路斯的命运完全掌握在其手中。	First, there is a strong, shared commitment between Christofias and Talat. They have met almost 70 times over the past 16 months, including two weeks of intensive talks immediately prior to my visit.
乌克兰本身拥有欧洲第三大储量；其他拥有庞大储量的国家包括波兰、法国、中国、印尼、澳大利亚、南非、阿根廷和墨西哥。	Ukraine itself has the third-largest reserves in Europe; other countries with large deposits include Poland, France, China, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, and Mexico.
在危险的时代，当风险的出现、时机和扩散都可能造成瘫痪性后果时，重要的不仅是我们取得什么成就，而是我们如何取得成就。	In perilous times, when the emergence, timing, and diffusion of risks can have a paralyzing effect, what matters is not simply what we accomplish, but how we accomplish it.
按照格雷厄姆的说法 ， “ 一个衰落的俄罗斯至多可以凭借乌拉尔以东稀少的人口及其广袤的资源成为大国，尤其是中美两国争夺的对象 。 ”	According to Graham, “At the extreme, a weak Russia, with its vast resources and sparse population east of the Urals, could become the object of competition among the great powers, notably China and the United States.”
他认为创造力被一种叫社团主义（corporatism）的公共哲学所桎梏，只有通过彻底改革金融和其他领域的私人机构才能重塑个性和活力。	He believes that creativity has been stifled by a public philosophy described as corporatism, and that only through thorough reform of our private institutions, financial and others, can individuality and dynamism be restored.
真正的浮动汇率发挥了其作用：消除积累外部债务的诱因，激励了实体经济内部的灵活性，并促进了深度兼具流动性的资本市场的发展。	Truly floating exchange rates generally served their purposes: removing the incentive to accumulate external debt, encouraging flexibility within the real economy, and promoting the development of deep and liquid capital markets.
最有力的证据显示美国人每天平均看电视5小时以上 — — 别忘了在看电视之前他们还花了几个小时在其他的视频设备上，这是一个多么惊人的数字啊。	The best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average – a staggering amount, given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices.
· 单位劳动力成本大幅下降，可以通过加速结构改革、让生产力增长快于工资增长来实现。 这也是不可能的，因为德国走完这一重塑竞争力之路花了足足15年。	· A rapid reduction in unit labor costs, via acceleration of structural reform and productivity growth relative to wage growth, is also unlikely, as that process took 15 years to restore competitiveness to Germany.
仅有一种假设情景可以在保障环境可持续性的同时改善人类福祉：那就是向非常规政策和措施转型所带来的“转型变革”之路。	There is just one scenario that can deliver improvements to human wellbeing in an environmentally sustainable way: the path of “transformational change,” brought about by a shift to unconventional policies and measures.
实际上，为了追求国家的经济稳定，奥巴马的领导班子显然正往施行某种政府干预的方向努力，而在过去二十年里，中国一直推行着这种政府干预。	Indeed, in pursuit of national economic stability, the Obama administration is clearly moving towards the kind of government intervention that China has been promoting over the past two decades.
如今在放弃了最初的计划之后，共和党人声称他们希望实施一项不会对财政收入构成影响的减税措施，其中包括不会对最顶端1％的高收入者进行减税。	Now, after abandoning their initial plan, Republicans claim they want a revenue-neutral tax cut that includes no reductions for the top 1% of earners.
通过支持外语教学和资助学生交流，他们就能像《阿拉伯发展报告》中规定的那样，帮该地区的人们实现自己的目标。	By supporting the teaching of foreign languages and financing student exchanges, they can help people in the region accomplish their own goals as spelled out in the Arab Human Development Report .
而共同货币脆弱性的根源则来自于《马斯特里赫特条约》框架的缺陷，该框架规定欧元区成员国在维持共同货币政策的同时可以制定符合共同财政规则的单一财政政策。	At the root of the common currency’s fragility are flaws in the Maastricht Treaty framework, which dictates that eurozone members maintain a common monetary policy and individual fiscal policies that conform to shared fiscal rules.
与此同时，大多数新兴市场国家拥有足够强大的财政实力，也有足够的汇率变化空间去实现一场非破坏性的调整以应对适度提升的全球利率。	Moreover, most emerging-market countries have strong enough fiscal positions and can afford flexible enough exchange rates to manage a non-disruptive adjustment to moderately higher global interest rates.
新千年伊始之际，世界各国领导者们庄重许诺，将致力于寻求和平方案、解决贫困问题，创造一个更为清洁的环境。	When the millennium opened, world leaders pledged to seek peace, the end of poverty, and a cleaner environment.
同样是这些共和党人，在赞成限制政府开支的同时又阻挠对国会程序进行制度改革。 这些改革是限制开支所必需的。	These same Republicans also argued for government spending restraint while blocking the institutional changes to Congressional procedures needed to make spending restraint possible.
事实上，债权人理应承担更大的责任：通常它们是成熟的金融机构，而借款人常常不太适应市场的变幻莫测以及与不同契约安排有关的风险。	In fact, creditors arguably are more responsible: typically, they are sophisticated financial institutions, whereas borrowers frequently are far less attuned to market vicissitudes and the risks associated with different contractual arrangements.
将这一借款权外包给国家投资银行只是一个释放信号的办法，表明任何新增借款都会被用于投资，而不会被用于当前支出。	Outsourcing such borrowing power to a National Investment Bank is merely a way to signal that any additional borrowing will be used for investment, not for current spending.
对畜牧动物所受待遇表示担忧的人绝不仅限于数量不多的素食者或严格素食主义者，也就是不吃一点动物产品的人。	Concern about how we treat farm animals is far from being limited to the small percentage of people who are vegetarians or even vegans – eating no animal products at all.
这些装置可以使动物在某种程度上控制它们生活的环境，比如通过移动到笼子的另一层或躲起来以逃避生活在同一只笼子内的其他动物的攻击。	Such devices enable animals to exert some control over their environment, such as escaping an attack from a cage-mate by moving to another level in the cage or hiding.
她也许不会强调缅甸的实际需要 — — 严肃的土地改革、反腐运动、将经济从寡头控制中解放出来 — — 而是陷入为不受欢迎的少数群体的辩护。	Instead of highlighting the country’s real needs – serious land reform, an anti-corruption drive, and freeing the economy from oligarchic control – she may instead be drawn into defending an unpopular minority.
美联储在有目的地破坏激励系统 — — 具体地说，是在扭曲资金价格所提供的信号 — — 这将会导致投资不当（而当公债被货币化时，还会产生通货膨胀 ） 。	The Fed is purposefully and insidiously distorting the incentive system – specifically, signals provided by the price of money – resulting in mal-investment (and, when public debt is monetized, inflation).
类似地，从2000年到2014年，33个州实行了各自的能源政策 — — 有的制定了广泛的气候行动计划，有的建立了可再生能源标准 — — 既减少了二氧化碳排放，也扩张了经济。	Likewise, from 2000 to 2014, by enacting a variety of energy policies – from broad climate action plans to mandated renewable-energy standards – 33 states cut carbon dioxide emissions while expanding their economies.
首先，那些离开的人通常是在意大利政府的资助下接受教育：每个大学毕业生整个学习生涯的总花费约为60万美元。	First, those who leave are usually educated in Italy at government expense: around $600,000 for the full school career of each college graduate.
大众欧洲的代表是领衔英国退出运动的英国独立党（Independence Party ） ， 它们就像莫内的反面，抓住TTIP或乌克兰入盟协定等外交妥协，将它们内部政治化。	The demotic Europe, exemplified by the UK Independence Party, which helped spearhead Brexit, is like Monnet in reverse, taking diplomatic compromises like the TTIP or the association agreement with Ukraine, and intentionally politicizing them.
从永恒的角度来看这样的不幸相对无关紧要，可是如果没有不幸，或者至少没有大部分不幸，这个世界将更美好。	Relatively insignificant as this suffering may be from the perspective of eternity, the world would be better without it, or at least without most of it.
伊拉克观察家乔尔·韦恩指出，公共部门就业从2005到2010年翻了一番，现在占到全职劳动力约60%的份额。	And, as Iraq observer Joel Wing has pointed out, public-sector employment doubled from 2005 to 2010, and now accounts for roughly 60% of the full-time labor force.
从长期看，卡斯特罗时代的结束加上对美关系的改善可能带来类似于西班牙在弗朗哥倒台后所走过的向完全的自由民主的转型。	In the longer term, the end of the Castro era, together with improved relations with the US, is likely to bring about a repeat of Spain’s transition toward full-fledged liberal democracy after the fall of Francisco Franco.
在选战期间，他似乎认识到，实现好的经济结果比政治身份政治更重要。 他的政党在政治身份政治方面臭名昭著。	During the election campaign, he seemed to recognize that achieving good economic results was more important than the politics of religious identity for which his party had been notorious.
斯大林的一位主要计划官员层被问及为何要为一系列荒唐的方案辩护，他的回答堪称经典 ： “ 我宁可站着制定（stand for）不现实的计划，也不要坐着（牢，sit in jail）制定现实的计划 。 ”	"When one of Joseph Stalin's chief planners was asked why he was willing to defend a series of ludicrous proposals, he famously replied, “I'd rather stand for unrealistic plans than sit [in jail] for realistic ones."""
香港政府认为可以不顾民众意见，在大多数功能性立法委员和少数亲政府的直选立法委员的支持下强行通过该议案。	Hong Kong's government felt it could ignore public opinion and push the bill through with a large majority of the functional members, plus a handful of directly elected pro-government legislators.
报告还强调，流行病在中等收入国家正在快速转变，而可传染、产妇、新生儿和营养失调在撒哈拉以南非洲根深蒂固。	It also highlighted the rapid pace of epidemiological transition in middle-income countries and the persistence of communicable, maternal, newborn, and nutritional disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa.
但在常规环境下，国家公共预算已能自动起到稳定作用 — — 通过失业保险、累进税收等措施实现 — — 并且这是一个衍生功能，而非主要目标。	But, under normal circumstances, national public-sector budgets already perform the stabilizing role automatically – through unemployment insurance, progressive taxation, and the like – and this is a derived role, not the primary objective.
古生物学、考古学以及（尤其是）遗传学的最新发现表明，现在的人类和一些古代人具有惊人的相似之处，这让评估现代人起源的工作更加复杂了。	Recent discoveries in paleontology, archaeology, and especially genetics of striking similarities between extant humans and some ancient populations are further complicating assessments of modern humans’ origins.
从中东到拉丁美洲和亚洲，许多专制政权或正逐渐采取步骤朝着更民主和更负责任的政府形式的方向迈进，或已成为羽翼丰满、功能完善的民主政体。	From the Middle East to Latin America and Asia, many autocracies are taking gradual steps towards more democratic and accountable forms of government, or have become fully-fledged and well functioning democracies.
这些发展趋势挑战了欧洲的价值、社会模式的可行性以及世界的长期安全，因此欧洲领导人必须专注于构建新的能源体系以确保可靠供给、合理定价和生态可持续性。	As these developments challenge Europe’s values, its social model’s viability, and the world’s long-term security, EU leaders must focus on building a new energy system that ensures a reliable supply, sensible pricing, and ecological sustainability.
东京—20世纪60年代，当莫洛伊斯兰解放阵线（Moro Islamic Liberation Front，简称MILF）游击队在菲律宾揭竿而起时，费迪南德·马科斯（Ferdinand Marcos）还没有成为总统，更不用说变成独裁者了。	TOKYO – When the Moro Islamic Liberation Front guerrilla movement took up arms in the Philippines in the 1960’s, Ferdinand Marcos had yet to become the country's president – let alone dictator.
事实上，在2008至2009年间外部融资突然断流的时候，希腊就已经存在着非常庞大的经常账户赤字 — — 规模超过GDP的10%以上，迫使其对国内支出进行调整。	In fact, Greece was running very large current-account deficits – exceeding 10% of GDP – when external financing dried up suddenly in 2008-2009, forcing an adjustment in domestic spending.
为了理解科学之于欧洲的作用，关键是要先明确科学 — — 也就是由好奇心驱动的尖端研究 — — 不能给欧洲带来什么：不能得到立即可以商业化的研究成果。	In order to understand what science can do for Europe, it is important to clarify what science – that is, curiosity-driven frontier research – cannot do for Europe: deliver results that can immediately be commercialized.
毕竟，真主党是黎巴嫩在抵抗以色列1982年入侵时的产物。 现在它正通过将自己刻画成阿拉伯—伊斯兰事业，也就是在巴勒斯坦问题上的领军人物，而努力重树自己在国内和更广泛地区的影响力。	Hezbollah is, after all, a creature of Lebanon’s resistance to Israel’s 1982 invasion, now trying to reassert its influence at home and in the wider region by portraying itself as a champion of the Arab-Islamic cause, namely in Palestine.
为了在此基础上更进一步，日本承诺下个月开始大规模财政扩张，有人称之为零散性、暂时性“直升机撒钱 ” （ 政府债务永久货币化 ） 。	To build on these gains, Japan has promised a large fiscal expansion next month, which some describe as a piecemeal, temporary version of so-called “helicopter drops” (permanent monetization of government debt).
如果上个月在北京讨论的方案能够实现的话，因此产生的自贸协议将在整合程度以及对世界经济的重要性方面超越北美自贸协议。	But if the proposals discussed in Beijing last month are realized, the resulting FTA could surpass NAFTA in its degree of integration and importance to the world economy.
但这项工作相当繁重，美联储官员塔鲁罗（Daniel Tarullo）承认 ， “ 清晰完整的解决方案还没有成型 。 ”	But it is uphill work, and Daniel Tarullo, a governor of the Federal Reserve, has acknowledged that “a clean and comprehensive solution is not in sight.”
2001年阿根廷单方面违约后，许多投资者更加认清了需要事先明确允许不太极端的替代方案，因此在债务契约中引入了所谓的“集体诉讼条款 ” 。	After Argentina’s unilateral default in 2001, many investors saw more clearly the need to allow explicitly for less drastic alternatives ahead of time, and so incorporated so-called “collective action clauses” into debt contracts.
瑞典首相洛夫文9月在蒙特利尔表示 ， “ 今天我们关注全球基金，但愿我们明天不要忘记为整个全球卫生安排提供充足的资金 。 ”	As Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said in Montreal in September: “Today we are focusing on the Global Fund, but tomorrow let’s not forget to provide sufficient funding for the entire global health architecture.”
但采取可持续土地管理战略能够贡献实现巴黎气候协定所指定的、将全球变暖控制在前工业化水平以上2℃以内的目标所需要的短期减排量的三分之一强。	But adopting sustainable land management strategies could provide more than one-third of the near-term emission reductions needed to keep warming well below the target – 2°C above pre-industrial levels – set by the Paris climate agreement.
事实上，从2002年10月至2005年4月这31个月的实际（去除通货膨胀的影响）联邦基金利率是负的。	Indeed, the real (inflation-corrected) federal funds rate was negative for 31 months, from October 2002 to April 2005.
但她表示SEC有很多事情要做，此事得先等一等 — — 这无异于委婉地表示SEC像当年在天安门广场上请愿的学生那样，已经屈服于不可抵挡的压力了。	But she confessed that the SEC had many other items on its agenda, and had placed the issue on the back burner – a polite way to say that the SEC, like the heroic students in Tiananmen Square, had surrendered under irresistible pressure.
美国贸易代表（USTR）办公室提出了正确的概念，它的谈判目标覆盖了劳工问题和工资、透明度、腐败，以及一些人权问题。	The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has the right idea, with negotiating objectives that cover labor issues and wages, transparency, corruption, and some aspects of human rights.
在这种情况下，尽管查韦斯的政策没有使得其核心选民受益，但是他仍然可以我行我素。 超过一半的委内瑞拉人生活在困苦绝望之中。	In such circumstances, Chávez can afford to be bold, despite his policies’ failure to benefit his core constituency: the more than 50% of Venezuelans who live in destitution and despair.
你也许会想，茨威格会为二战后成立的联合国和布雷顿森林体系感到欣慰，更不用说此后数十年的复兴和和解时期。	One imagines that Zweig would have been comforted by the post-WWII creation of the United Nations and the Bretton-Woods system, not to mention the subsequent decades of reconstruction and reconciliation.
这种席卷全球富裕经济体的私人固定金额养老金的衰减是一件坏事，因为资产价格构成表明，年轻以及中年工人们极为重视固定金额的养老金。	This fall-off in private defined-benefit pensions all across the rich core of the world economy is a bad thing, because the configuration of asset prices suggests that young and middle-aged workers value defined-benefit pensions extremely highly.
比方说，一名前基地组织成员不久前曾经表示英国当局未能很好地解释不干预叙利亚内战的原因有可能进一步激化穆斯林的激进情绪。	A former Al Qaeda member, for example, recently stated that the UK authorities’ failure to explain properly why it had not intervened in Syria’s civil war risked radicalizing more Muslims.
亚特兰大 — — 波兰执政的法律与正义党（PiS）最近颁布的一部引起争议的法律因为将“波兰死亡集中营”这样的表述定义为刑事犯罪而引发了世界各国的广泛关注。	ATLANTA – A controversial law recently enacted by Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has attracted a tremendous amount of attention around the world for its criminalization of expressions like “Polish death camps.”
它不仅未能结束长期存在的巴以冲突，反而通过推翻伊拉克政府制造了新的问题。 西方在阿富汗出资支持圣战者，同时支持赞同其伊拉克、叙利亚、埃及和其他国家安全议程的独裁专制人员。	It failed to end the long-standing Palestinian conflict, and it created new problems by dismantling the Iraqi state, funding mujahedeen in Afghanistan, and backing dictators who supported its security agenda in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and elsewhere.
但捍卫作为这些起诉基础的核心原则也很重要，即普遍管辖权（universal jurisdiction）的概念。	But it is also important to preserve the core principle underlying these prosecutions: the concept of universal jurisdiction.
此外，哥伦比亚已经成为越来越具有吸引力的投资目的地，因为它在减少贫困，创造就业，基础设施发展和教育改革方面都取得了长足的进步。	Moreover, Colombia has become an increasingly attractive investment destination, as it has made great strides in poverty reduction, job creation, infrastructure development, and education reform.
亚努克维奇代表的是顿涅茨克派别，是几个地理上被定义为主张寡头政治的团体之一，这些团体争相控制乌克兰的商业和政治。	Yanukovych represents the Donetsk clan, one of several geographically defined oligarchic groups that compete to dominate Ukrainian business and politics.
许多人都担心这仅仅是长期冲突的开始，这样的冲突可能用到远超贸易范畴的武器，并带来远超贸易范畴的伤亡。	Many fear that this is only the beginning of a long conflict that could include weapons – and casualties – far outside the realm of trade.
就拿印度洋和其他东亚地区的领土纠纷来说吧。 中国一再地 — — 并且越来越坚决地 — — 主张其广大的海洋国土面积。	Consider the territorial disputes roiling the Indian Ocean and other East Asian regions, sparked by China’s repeated – and increasingly assertive – efforts to claim sovereignty over vast maritime areas.
11月，俄罗斯与巴基斯坦的外交关系也取得了突破，绍伊古（Sergei Shoigu）成为1969年以来第一个访问巴基斯坦的俄罗斯国防部长。	November was also a good month for Russian diplomacy in Pakistan, with Sergei Shoigu becoming the first Russian defense minister to visit the country since 1969.
并且，更常见的情形是他们观看的是个人成就 — — 山地车速降选手的凝神聚气、动如脱兔和勇气，或者体操选手完美规范的动作 — — 而不是真正的团队努力。	And, more often than not, what we are witnessing is individual achievement – the deeply concentrated agility and courage of the downhill racer or the finely disciplined movements of the gymnast – rather than true team effort.
事实上，糖的吸引力是造成加工食品业目前利润率保持在5 % （ 之前仅有1 % ） 的主要原因，这也能够解释为什么我们许多人生病、肥胖、愚蠢、破产、抑郁并陷入彻头彻尾的痛苦之中。	In fact, sugar’s allure is a big reason why the processed food industry’s current profit margin is 5% (up from 1%), and why so many of us are sick, fat, stupid, broke, depressed, and just plain miserable.
“为了给这片土地上的人民提供更好的生活， 应该更加关注实质而不是形式 。 ” 在即将举行就职典礼之前，奥巴马接受采访时如是说。	“In delivering a better life for people on the ground, one should be more concerned with substance than with form,” Obama stated in an interview just before his inauguration.
威尔逊无法像英法领导人常作的那样要求他的人民去“杀死德国佬 ” ， 因为威尔逊的太多战士至少从种族渊源上划分本身就来自德国。	Wilson could not implore his people to “kill the Krauts,” as British or French leaders frequently did, because so many of Wilson’s soldiers were, by ethnicity at least, Krauts themselves.
全球每年要生产3亿吨肉食，联合国粮农组织估算，如果需求继续按照当前增长率增长，2050年肉食产量将增加到4.55亿吨。	Worldwide, 300 million tons of meat are produced each year, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that the annual amount will increase to 455 million tons by 2050 if demand continues to grow at the current rate.
穷国可以效仿南非和博茨瓦纳，通过限��出口原始形式的原材料（这一政策在当地被称为“矿物增效 ” （ beneficiation ） ） 利用自然财富强行推动工业化。	Poor countries could follow the example of South Africa and Botswana and use their natural wealth to force industrialization by restricting the export of minerals in raw form (a policy known locally as “beneficiation”).
此外，贫穷地区经济活动较少，相应的税收总量也较低，阻碍了他们利用税收来提高人民生活质量和兴建基础设施。	Poor regions have a low base of economic activity to tax, which prevents them from investing in human and physical capital.
中国政府最近修改了税法，将雇主支付雇员退休金计划开支从应税所得中扣除，并且养老金计划中所累计的资金均可免税。	The Chinese government recently modified the tax law to exclude employers’ contributions to employee pension plans from taxable income and to allow the funds in those plans to accumulate tax-free.
来自心理学研究的第二个洞见由布鲁斯·胡德（Bruce Hood）在其新书《自我幻觉 》 （ The Self Illusion）中进行了总结。	The second insight from psychological research, summarized by Bruce Hood in his recent book The Self Illusion, relates to the role of consciousness in decision-making.
中国的外部收支已相当接近于平衡，因此我们大有理由认为人民币在自2005年中以来升值近三分之一后，已经相当接近“公允价值”了。	With China’s external position much closer to balance, there is good reason to argue that the renminbi, having appreciated by nearly one-third since mid-2005, is now within a reasonable proximity of “fair value.”
例如，德国总理安格拉·默克尔刚刚开始了她第四个四年任期 — — 欧洲其他国家大体对这种进展持欢迎而非批评态度。	For example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just begun her fourth four-year term – a development that the rest of Europe has largely welcomed rather than criticized.
首先，在债权国和债务国经济和金融差异越拉越大之时（目前已有人开始论及文化差异 ） ， 法国是联系南欧和北欧不可或缺的节点。	First, France is an indispensable link between southern and northern Europe at a time of growing economic and financial division between creditors and debtors (a fissure that has begun to assume a cultural dimension).
正如较受欢迎且一贯理智的Vox.com新闻网头条所言 ： “ 对于其他国家的穷人来说，没有什么比伯尼·桑德斯的言论最更可怕了 。 ” 。	“If you’re poor in another country, this is the scariest thing Bernie Sanders has said,” ran a headline in the popular and normally sober Vox.com news site.
拉丁美洲和南亚已经快速地提供了专业护理，但是，根据目前非洲的进步水平，在2015年的时候仍然有50％的妇女在生产时没有专业护理。	Latin America and Southeast Asia have rapidly increased coverage, but at the current rate of progress in Africa, 50% of women will still deliver without skilled care in the year 2015.

就算进去了，也对中国让自身货币成为国外私人及官方投资者广泛使用的第一流国际交易和储备货币的目标没什么影响。	Inclusion would make no difference in terms of progress toward China’s goal of developing its currency into a first-class international and reserve currency widely used by private and official foreign investors.
但是，尽管我总是会选平均水平的司机而不是两分水平的司机，但由于在选择两分司机和瞎选之间，我还是会选择两分司机，因为害怕选到更差的司机让我不会选择冒险。	But, while I would always pick an average driver over a driver with a rating of two, given the choice between a two driver and a blind pick, I might pick the two, because the fear of someone even worse would keep me from taking a risk.
一些证据表明，新的东盟经济共同体（地区自由贸易协定框架）正在帮助东南亚国家抵御日益动荡的全球经济环境。	Some evidence also suggests that the new ASEAN Economic Community, a framework for a regional free-trade agreement, is helping Southeast Asian countries weather an increasingly turbulent global economic environment.

叙利亚国内和周边地区还分布着竭力拓展自身势力的极端伊斯兰团体 — — 他们反应迅速，擅长利用任何国家出现的动荡局势。	The region in and around Syria is also populated by extremist Islamist groups that are attempting to expand their spheres of influence - and that are quick to capitalize on instability in any country.
现今，在颇具争议的大选后于2007年6月掌权的Umar Yar’Adua总统誓愿在2020年将让尼日利亚跻身全球前20大经济体的行列。	Nowadays, the mantra of President Umar Yar’Adua, who took power in June 2007, following controversial elections, is to transform the country into one of the world’s 20 largest economies by 2020.
当和平面临严重威胁时，比如眼下的美朝僵局，联合国政治事务局通常会站出来为重要的幕后外交斡旋提供便利。	When a dire threat to peace arises, such as the current standoff between the US and North Korea, it is the UN’s Department of Political Affairs that often facilitates vital, behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
企业会持续对自己的工人进行投资和再投资，因为1951年制定的《共同决定法 》 （ Codetermination Law）规定后者在董事会中占有一个席位，令工人可以坚持要求企业这样做。	Companies invest and reinvest in their workers, because the latter can insist on it, possessing as they do a seat in the boardroom as a result of the 1951 Codetermination Law.

事实上，仅仅是叙利亚冲突就足以改变冲突图表 — — 如果将伊拉克、也门和利比亚的死亡人数包括进来，上升趋势将更加陡峭。	Indeed, the Syrian conflict alone has been enough to change the graph of conflict — and the upward trajectory becomes even steeper when the deaths in Iraq, Yemen, and Libya are included.
2011至2017年间，因避难申请被拒或被发现没有身份证件，欧洲潜在回流者数量达550万，比之前增加了4倍。	Technological disruption is also putting pressure on labor markets.
2009年，我即将成为乌干达第六名神经外科医师，在穆拉戈国立中心医院（Mulago National Referral Hospital，乌干达最高级的医院）就职。	In 2009, I was on track to become only the sixth neurosurgeon in Uganda, working at Mulago National Referral Hospital, the country’s main tertiary institution.
印度尼西亚是全世界婴儿死亡率最高的国家之一，该国棉兰（Medan）农村地区的助产士使用移动应用收集孕妇的医学数据。	In Indonesia, which has one of the world’s highest infant mortality rates, midwives in the rural area of Medan collect medical data from pregnant women using a mobile app.
此外，后计划检查程序并没有给予官方债权人“三驾马车 ” — —欧盟委员会、欧洲央行和国际货币基金组织（IMF ） — —想要的对希腊的支配权。	Moreover, the post-program surveillance procedure does not give the “troika” of official creditors – the European Commission, the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund – the leverage over Greece that they desire.
在如此紧张的局势下，毫不奇怪，在经历了七十年的间断后，反犹主义是否回归法国的问题正在全球引起轩然大波。	In this tense setting, it comes as no surprise that the question of whether anti-Semitism has returned to France, after a seven-decade hiatus, is making international headlines.
凯恩斯认为经济可能会陷入长期性的“不充分就业均衡 ” ； 在这种情况下，就需要某种外部刺激来使其恢复到更高的就业水平上。	Economies, Keynes believed, can become stuck in prolonged periods of “under-employment equilibrium”; in such cases, an external stimulus of some kind is needed to jolt them back to higher employment.
发自布鲁塞尔 — — 自2007~09年大衰退以来，大多数经济学家都开始将金融视为商业周期的关键驱动力，但对这一动力究竟如何运作方面还是缺乏全面的了解。	BRUSSELS – Since the Great Recession of 2007-2009, most economists have begun to regard finance as a key driver of the business cycle. But the precise dynamics are not yet fully understood.
而为什么这次情况会不同则可在奥斯卡·乔达（Òscar Jordà ） 、 莫利兹·舒拉里克（Moritz Schularick ） 、 艾伦M·泰勒（Alan M. Taylor）最近发表的论文里找到答案。	The reason why things were different this time can be found in a recently published paper by Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor.
所以，当工人和中层经理离开这些公司的时候，他们带走的不仅是许多重要的信息，而且通常也带走了他们公司的心脏和灵魂，从而对美国的竞争力产生深远的影响。	So, as workers and middle managers have been departing these companies, they have taken with them not only much critical information, but often also the hearts and souls of their enterprises, with profound effects on American competitiveness.
这样，各企业投资于扩大产能就越发具有价值。 它们把能够在今天分配给股东的现金交换用来获得更佳的市场地位从而可以在今后回报他们的股东。	This makes it more worthwhile for businesses to invest in expanding their capacity, thus trading away cash they could distribute to their shareholders today for a better market position that will allow them to reward their shareholders in the future.

从长远来看，遏制严重气候相关问题的唯一办法是制定更好的适应性战略，碳捕获和封存技术，以及无政府补贴即可规模生产的可再生能源。	Over the long term, the only way to limit serious climate-related problems is to develop better adaptation strategies, carbon-capture and sequestration technologies, and renewable-energy sources that can reach scale without government subsidies.
更重要的是，伊朗承诺遵守国际原子能机构附加协议，未来15年终，国际原子能机构可以随时随地获得其核计划的所有要素信息。	Most important, Iran has committed itself to apply the Additional Protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency, providing the organization with round-the-clock access to all components of its nuclear program for 15 years.
尽管突尼斯避免了灾难，但大部分其他受影响国家最终都陷入了混乱，而叙利亚的残酷内战更是助长了伊斯兰国的崛起。	While Tunisia has averted disaster, most of the other affected countries have ended up mired in chaos, with Syria’s brutal civil war facilitating the rise of the Islamic State.

中国在全球范围内难以与美国竞争的事实并不意味着它也不能在东亚范围内对美国形成挑战，否则有关台湾的战争就不可能了。	China’s inability to compete with the US on a global basis does not mean that it could not challenge the US in East Asia, or that war over Taiwan is impossible.

在“有效控制”边界问题的基础上更多地关注“贸易及多边问题 ” ， 因为在上述领域取得成功能够翻开两国关系史上更受人欢迎的“新”篇章。	With the border issue “effectively controlled,” there should be greater focus on “trade and multilateral issues,” where success could bring about a “new” and welcome “chapter” in bilateral ties.
从PiS支持的波兰总统安德烈·杜巴拒绝在前任议会所选定的三位宪法法庭法官面前宣誓就职开始，波兰面临着一场宪政危机。	Poland is experiencing a constitutional crisis that began when PiS-backed Polish President Andrzej Duda refused to swear in three Constitutional Tribunal judges chosen by the previous parliament.

归根结底，尽管收入增长、生育率下降是中国和很多发展中国家的共同特色，但高储蓄快增长的良性循环在中国的发展势头远比其他发展中国家更为强劲。	After all, the virtuous circle of high savings and rapid growth operates more strongly in China than in other developing countries where incomes are rising and birth rates are falling.
日内瓦报道－当瑞士国家银行（简称“瑞行 ” ） 最近将利率下调到0.25 % ， 该行宣布其将实行“定额放松”政策，实则是在紧跟美联储与英格兰银行所实行的措施。	GENEVA – When the Swiss National Bank (SNB) recently brought its interest rate down to 0.25%, it announced that it would engage in “quantitative easing,” following in the footsteps of the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.

马耳他自 1964 年独立以来议会里就只有两个政党，如今这两党还沆瀣一气搞寡头政治，垄断了该国一切事务。	There, the only two political parties represented in parliament since independence in 1964 have ganged up to ensure for themselves an oligarchic duopoly on anything that goes on in the country.
但即便健康服务使用水平相同 — — 比如非洲的HIV/艾滋病案例 — — 基于性别的预期让HIV阳性男性无法获得与需要相配的抗逆转录病毒药物。	But even when health-care use would be expected to be equal, such as care for HIV/AIDS in Africa, gender-based expectations impede HIV-positive men from obtaining antiretroviral drugs proportionate to their needs.
但对于一些经济学领域的人来说，这种将心理学研究纳入到经济学研究（哪怕只是其中一部分）的观念就足以对他产生多年的敌意了。	For some in the profession, the idea that psychological research should even be part of economics has generated hostility for years.
再加上令人堪忧的增长前景，美国股市将承受压力，而就业和家庭收入的下降可能导致美国和中国都蒙受巨大的GDP损失。	That, together with diminished growth prospects, would depress equity markets, and declining employment and household income could lead to a sizeable loss of GDP in both the US and China.
如今，显而易见世界上许多经济体正在经历某种结构性变化，并且，这一变化导致了“就业岗位-生产率-收入”分配三角发生倾斜。	It should be evident by now that many of the world’s economies are undergoing some form of structural change, and in the wake of that change, the “jobs-productivity-income” distribution triangle has gone askew.
其实，早在1979年Howard Morland就在《进步》杂志上公开了氢弹的“秘密 ” ， 当时美国政府还提出起诉，企图查禁，不过败诉了。	Indeed, the “secret” of the hydrogen bomb was published in 1979 in an article by Howard Morland in The Progressive magazine, sparking a failed legal suit by the US government to suppress it.
此外，积极的反恐措施和修建隔离墙成功地抑制了跨境袭击，并随着冲突的不断发酵而导致巴勒斯坦内部压力越积越多。	Moreover, aggressive counter-terrorism activities and the separation barrier have decisively reduced cross-border attacks, containing mounting pressure in Palestine as the conflict remains on the back burner.
但20世纪80年代以来的教训是只要有助于维护合理开放的世界经济，超级全球化的某些逆转并不一定是件坏事。	But the lesson from the 1980s is that some reversal from hyper-globalization need not be a bad thing, as long as it serves to maintain a reasonably open world economy.
但如果各国想要在女孩保护和赋权方面取得成功，就必须做好一个关键步骤：扩大人乳头瘤病毒疫苗的普及度。 人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）是绝大部分宫颈癌的致病原因。	But if countries are to succeed in protecting and empowering girls, they must also embrace the promise of a key initiative: to expand access to the vaccine for human papillomavirus, which causes the vast majority of cervical cancer cases.
将养老金系统视为管理 — — 失业、疾病、利率波动、猝死或长寿 — — 风险的一种方式对解决问题会有所帮助。	To address that problem, it helps to think of any pension system as a way of managing risks – of unemployment, illness, volatile interest rates, sudden death, or a very long life span.
货币联盟之所以成为你可能，唯一的原因是欧盟国家间已经实现了深度一体化 — — 而共用一种货币深化了这个一体化。	Monetary union is possible only because of the substantial integration already achieved among European Union countries – and sharing a single currency deepens that integration.

用某高级非政府组织人权领导者的话说 ， “ 它们在惩罚叙利亚人民，原因是它们不满北约下令保护利比亚平民，最终却变为下令改变利比亚体制 。 ”	In the words of a senior NGO human rights leader: “They’re punishing the Syrian people because they were unhappy that NATO took the mandate of protecting civilians in Libya and transformed it into a mandate for regime change.”
八国集团为了挽救其信誉度，就需要再一次明确表明它将会履行承诺，到2010年每年向非洲增加援助250亿美元。	To salvage its credibility, the G-8 needs to make crystal clear ­– once again – that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to Africa by $25 billion per year by 2010.
我们的选民不可能在不必担心精神错乱的情况下在某次选举中选择某一个方向，而在下一次选举中选择另一个截然相反的方向。	Our voters cannot stroll in one direction during one poll, and in the opposite direction the next time they vote, without worrying about falling over the edge.
事实上，除了在圣诞前夜宣布削减预算，美国驻联合国大事尼基·哈雷（Nikki Haley）还警告美国着眼于进一步削减预算。	Indeed, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, accompanied the Christmas Eve announcement with a warning that the US would be on the lookout for further reductions.
类似地，基于技术的医疗通过手机或平板电脑实现，能够改善健康结果，即使是最偏远地区的妇女也能获得这些服务，而不再需要冒风险长途跋涉去看医生。	Likewise, technology-enabled health care delivered via phone or tablet improves health outcomes, as it reaches women even in the remotest areas, sparing them a long and often risky trek to see a doctor.

在去年12月，白宫同意了共和党人提出的一项提案，将法案中一条关于限制各美国银行巨头过度投机行为的条款废除（而该提案的文本正是由花旗银行执笔的）	In December, the White House agreed to a Republican proposal to repeal a provision of Dodd-Frank that would have limited the risk-taking of the country’s largest banks (in fact, the proposal’s language was drafted by Citigroup).
在经济学方面，卡罗·阿尔贝托奖 — — 该奖项两年一度，颁发给40岁以下优秀意大利经济学家 — — 的8位获奖者中有7位是在国外顶尖大学就职。	In economics, seven of the eight recipients of the Carlo Alberto Medal, which is awarded biennially to an outstanding Italian economist under the age of 40, were teaching in elite foreign universities.
据埃默里大学的马诺基·贾殷说，每年美国有20万病人可以靠人工心脏维持更长的生命，每名患者花费20万美元，共400亿美元。 这是一个合理利用资源的国家吗？	In countries that provide free health care to their citizens, it is extraordinarily difficult for officials to tell anyone that the government will not pay for the only drug or medical device that can save their life – or their child’s life.
但在（比如）印度，流产是合法的，并且没有可比的计划生育政策，这一数字要显著更低 — — 也许没有印度卫生和家庭福祉部所公布的每年630,000起那么低。	But in, say, India, where abortion is legal and no comparable family-planning policy exists, the figure is significantly lower – though probably not as low as the 630,000 annual figure provided by the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
第一个要素是，法兰西共和国素来禁止在官方人口普查中，或者由政府机构或私营企业收集有关种族、宗教甚至是社会阶层的数据。	The first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enterprises – on ethnicity, religion, and even social class.
据两位麻省理工学院研究人员的新研究，最富有的1%的美国人要比最穷的1%多活近15年；而最富有的1%的美国妇女要比最穷妇女多活十年。	According to a new study by two MIT researchers, the wealthiest 1% of American men tend to live almost 15 years longer than the poorest 1%; and the wealthiest 1% of American women can expect to live ten years longer than their poorer counterparts.
一方面，由于二氧化碳是一种肥料，其水平的增加有利于农业，最大的积极效应也在于此，相当于GDP的0.8 % 。	On one hand, because CO2 works as a fertilizer, higher levels have been a boon for agriculture, which comprises the biggest positive impact, at 0.8% of GDP.
新德里 — — 过去八年来，随着中国在亚洲的姿态越来越激进，许多人批评美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马未能勇敢地面对这个亚洲巨人。	NEW DELHI – Over the last eight years, as China’s posturing in Asia became increasingly aggressive, many criticized US President Barack Obama for failing to stand up to the Asian giant.

MBS在玩火，美国总统特朗普则给了他相当广泛的支持，这是因为特朗普自己十分憎恶伊朗，也许还希望沙特阿拉伯支持美国领导的巴勒斯坦和平计划。	As MBS plays with fire, US President Donald Trump has offered him broad support, owing to his own animosity toward Iran and, perhaps, the hope that Saudi Arabia will support a US-led peace plan on Palestine.
将在下个月举行会晤的美国总统特朗普和中国国家主席习近平必须共同遏制朝鲜半岛的紧张局面 — — 在他们被发现没穿裤子之前。	US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who will meet next month, must work together to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula, before they are caught with their pants down.

发自哥本哈根 — — 针对全球变暖问题的讨论正越来越被某种思维所占据：它试图消灭那些“动机不纯”的想法，甚至还质疑民主辩论本身的价值。	COPENHAGEN – Discussions about global warming are marked by an increasing desire to stamp out “impure” thinking, to the point of questioning the value of democratic debate.
鉴于政府历史上显示出的干预市场及社会的能力，危机发生时，中国的上下阶层往往默认应依赖政府措施而非市场力量来应对，而不是容忍市场自身无序的自查自纠。	Given the government’s proven capacity to intervene, the default option during a crisis has been to rely on administrative measures rather than on market forces.
因此，我们要求全世界的政府和出资者给予产科应有的关注。 产科是全球一大卫生问题的显而易见的解决办法。	That is why we are asking governments and donors around the world to give midwifery the attention that it deserves as a commonsense solution to a global health problem.
同一时期世界其余国家净跨境投资头寸增加3万亿美元，主要原因是大宗商品繁荣，而随着中国经济减速，大宗商品已经回落。	The rest of the world’s net investment position strengthened by $3 trillion during this period, owing mainly to the commodity boom, which faded as China slowed.
引入西方式的租市场能够让囊中羞涩或无法获得父母亲支持的家庭移民到城市中（目前这样的家庭必须买房 ） 。	And the introduction of a Western-style rental market will allow families without substantial cash or parental support to move to cities (where families currently must purchase their apartments).
通过彻底放松管制，特朗普内阁实际正乞求企业损害消费者利益、破坏环境，而且从长远角度看，损害他们自身的利益。	By pursuing radical deregulation, the Trump administration is practically begging businesses to harm consumers, the environment, and, in the long run, themselves.
这有望改善土耳其的女性劳动力参与率 — — 目前平均水平为30%左右，但有大学文凭者高达72 % 。	This is likely to improve female labor-force participation in Turkey, which is around 30% on average, but 72% for those with a university diploma.

“系统重要性”成为维持不可逾越的准入壁垒的接口（也是高管希望自己的公司变得太大而不能倒的又一原因 ） 。	“Systemic importance” has become an excuse for maintaining impenetrable entry barriers (yet another reason why executives want their firms to be regarded as too big to fail).
"甚至没有人想到过给这种20世纪60年代曾被我们强烈反对的""分离而平等""理念取个名字：在平等的公共领域中存在着迥然不同的个人生活。"	"No one has yet found a name for this new version of the ""separate but equal"" doctrine that some of us fought so hard against in the 1960's: separate private lives in a common public space that is equal for all."
发自剑桥 — — 当巴基斯坦军队在斯瓦特谷地与塔利班浴血奋战之时，他们其实是在为巴基斯坦的精神而战。	CAMBRIDGE – As its army confronts, ever more bloodily, the Taliban in the Swat Valley, Pakistan is fighting for its very soul.
国际社会要么团结起来，共同应对贫困、资源耗尽和气候变化，要么下一代将面临资源战争、政治动荡和环境崩溃。	Either the global community will join together to fight poverty, resource depletion, and climate change, or it will face a generation of resource wars, political instability, and environmental ruin.
纽约—金融危机十年后，世界各地的经济环境或多或少地回归了常态，如今，民族主义民粹主义被视为全球复苏的最大威胁。	NEW YORK – With economic conditions returning more or less to normal around the world after a decade of financial crises, nationalist populism is now seen as the biggest threat to global recovery.
是否是因为大屠杀的记忆蒙蔽了以色列领导人的视野并扰乱了他们的思维 — — 那为什么在以色列建国之初大屠杀的影响却微乎其微？	Or perhaps the weight of Holocaust remembrance has blinded Israel’s leaders and distorted their thinking – in ways that, at the time the State of Israel was created, the Holocaust itself almost miraculously did not.
纽顿的枪击事件不但可怕可悯，而且反映了日趋常见的模式 — — 心理学家和精神专家已有深入研究的一种特殊的杀戮式自杀（murder-suicide ） 。	The shooting in Newtown was not only especially horrific and heartbreaking, but is also part of an increasingly common pattern – a specific kind of murder-suicide that has been carefully studied by psychologists and psychiatrists.
这些国家不仅在上述领域指标领先；而且可以从过去半个世纪的电脑、手机、互联网和铁氟龙等技术创新中受益。	Not only did these countries achieve better social indicators in these dimensions; they also could benefit from the technological innovations of the past half-century: computers, cellphones, the Internet, Teflon, and so on.

自动预算削减 — — 它可能让2013年增长降低了1.75个百分点 — — 在继续进行，但比以前温和了许多。	Automatic budget cuts – which reduced 2013 growth by as much as 1.75 percentage points from what it otherwise would have been – continue, but in a much milder form.
事实上，那位以最明确的态度告诉我，他对哪怕只是略微令人不快的事实也没有任何兴趣的众议员，即凯文·布雷迪（Kevin Brady）如今身居众议院筹款委员会（Ways and Means Committee）主席。 该委员会在税收政策方面起着关键作用。	In fact, Kevin Brady, the representative who told me most clearly that he was not interested in looking at even moderately inconvenient facts, is now Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, which plays a key role in what happens with taxes.
他们希望与会的决策者们知道他们的决定影响着普罗大众，而不只是担心通胀如何影响自己的债券的价值或升息如何影响自己的股票组合的金融家。	They wanted the assembled policymakers to know that their decisions affect ordinary people, not just the financiers who are worried about what inflation does to the value of their bonds or what interest-rate hikes might do to their stock portfolios.
无法掌控的历史大潮将前这位前克格勃陆军中校从不知名的角落席卷出来，带到了权力的顶峰，但命运也可能以同样的速度将他再次冲走。	A historical wave beyond his control had lifted the former KGB lieutenant colonel from out of the shadows to the pinnacle of power. But fate might also just as suddenly wash him away.
但在当前的政治气候下此举变得太过危险，许多农民只能举债喂养老牛，而在印度已经越来越难以承载如此庞大的牛只数量。	But, because that would be far too dangerous in the current political climate, many farmers are being driven into debt caring for old cows, while the cow population in India becomes increasingly unsustainable.
应该指出的是，在乌克兰，人们被迫发动一次又一次的革命 — — 先是推翻总统列昂尼德·库奇马（Leonid Kuchma ） ， 接着把维克托·亚努科维奇（Viktor Yanukovych）赶下台 — — 以防止这种体制的确立 (第三次革命是否正在酝酿之中尚待观察 ) 。	In Ukraine, it should be noted, revolutions have been required – first under Leonid Kuchma, and then under Viktor Yanukovych, to prevent such a system from being established (whether a third attempt is currently underway today remains to be seen).
因此他们找到了用来自我怜悯的共同语言，就像奥尔班、萨尔维尼，怀尔德斯和其他人声称被“达沃斯党”压迫一样。	Hence the common language of self-pity, as though Orbán, Salvini, Wilders, and the rest were being oppressed by the “Davos Party.”
但安倍同时参观、并表示希望回到被视为民族主义圣地的东京靖国神社，那里供奉着14名甲级战犯，所供奉的乙级和丙级战犯数更是超过1，000人。	But he did so while visiting – and voicing his wish to return to – Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, a nationalist pilgrimage site that commemorates, among others, 14 Class A and more than 1,000 Class B and C war criminals.
这些来自气候议会的呼声也汇入到了那些著名公众人物日渐增强的诉求之中 — — 他们提出我们需要清理自身的能源使用习惯。	The voices from the Climate Parliament join a growing crescendo of influential actors who are speaking out about the need to clean up our energy habits.
去年，民主刚果中部的开赛（Kasai）地区有140万人流离失所，使得失去家园的总人口达到了410万 — — 也是非洲规模最大的国内难民群体。	Last year, conflict in the DRC’s central Kasai region displaced some 1.4 million people, bringing the total displaced population to 4.1 million – the largest concentration of internal refugees anywhere in Africa.
只有认识到旧增长模式的弱点、追求必须的结构性改革，新兴经济体才能获得强劲、稳定和可持续的GDP增长 — — 并充分实现它们成为全球经济主要引擎的潜力。	Only by recognizing the weaknesses of old growth patterns and pursuing the needed structural reforms can emerging economies achieve strong, stable, and sustainable GDP growth – and fulfill their potential as the global economy’s main engines.
尽管用“无根游子”一词形容讨厌的犹太人的是斯大林，但反犹主义者认为犹太人是天生的布尔什维克，并且有可能连苏联也是他们把持的。	"Though it was Stalin who used the phrase “rootless cosmopolitans"" to describe unwanted Jews, anti-Semites believed that Jews were natural Bolsheviks and probably pulled the strings in the Soviet Union, too."
哥伦比亚 20世纪90年代曾经出现过这种状况，当时咖啡价格的意外下降拉低了咖啡主产区的收入，加剧了那里的紧张局势。	This occurred in Colombia in the 1990’s, when an unexpected drop in coffee prices lowered wages and intensified conflict in coffee-dependent regions.
如果说土耳其的货币政策实验给了我们什么教训，那就是国内审慎监管和货币政策工具应该被视为资本账户管理的补充而不是替代措施。	If there is a lesson to be learned from Turkey’s monetary-policy experiment, it is that domestic prudential regulations and monetary-policy tools should be viewed as complements to – not substitutes for – capital-account management.
但不管是法国对货币和信用的近乎完全的控制，还是其在政治和安全方面的强大影响力，都不能承担让法郎区国家陷于贫困和动荡陷阱无法自拔的责任。	But neither France’s near-total control of money and credit, nor its strong influence over politics and security, is wholly responsible for keeping the franc-zone countries mired in poverty and instability.
当我们可以完全将一个人的生命换算为货币，我们应该接受这个小小的胜利，然后再去追求大项目，大项目的价格也许更大，并且不能保证成功。	When we can completely transform someone’s life for pennies, we should accept that small victory before pursuing grand projects with even grander price tags and no guarantee of success.
在欧洲，包括欧洲央行在内的决策者要求重债国实行整合，但在谈判中态度颇为灵活；不过选民拒绝了这一要求 — — 最新的例子是意大利。	In Europe, policymakers, including the European Central Bank, demand consolidation for high-debt countries, but are flexible in negotiations; voters, however, reject it – most recently in Italy.
在某种层次上，这一事实令人沮丧：我们经济学家相信人们有足够的智慧理解周边的环境，也有足够的能力保护自己的利益。	On one level, this is very frustrating: we economists believe that people are smart enough to understand their situation and capable enough to pursue their own interests.
现在，当局正在利用一场打击“淫秽”互联网内容的斗争来清除政治敏感内容，包括对零八宪章的讨论。 中国网民在网上发现了这一亲民主的文章后有几千人签名。	Now, a new crackdown against “vulgar” Internet content is being used to clean up politically sensitive writings – including discussion of Charter 08 , a pro-democracy treatise signed by thousands of Chinese who discovered it online.
自去年11月以来，萨勒曼以可疑的罪名抓捕了数百名沙特精英阶层 — — 包括王子和在国际上赫赫有名的商人 — — 丝毫不顾法治。	Since last November, MBS has had hundreds of members of the Saudi elite – including princes and businessmen with international profiles – arrested on dubious grounds, and with no regard for the rule of law.
以移民为例，虽然绝大多数非法移民都在努力操持家庭并改善自己子女的生活，但也有些人犯下严重罪行或参加暴力团伙。	While the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants are working to support their families and improve the lives of their children, some commit serious crimes or belong to violent gangs.
但得益于公共资金的银行现在变得比以前更大，不透明的金融工具再一次成为时尚；银行家的奖金池也再一次溢满。	But the banks that benefited from public money are now bigger than ever; opaque financial instruments are once again de rigueur; and bankers’ bonus pools are overflowing.
毕竟，黎巴嫩已经比许多其他国家做出了大得多的贡献，在本地人口和经济饱受压力的情况下接收了超过一百万叙利亚难民。	After all, Lebanon has already done far more than many other countries, accepting well over a million Syrian refugees despite the intense pressure on the local population and economy.
热带农业国际中心负责人Joachim Voss出面确认这种黄豆已收入该中心的基因库，并确认这种黄豆原产于墨西哥。	Joachim Voss, then CIAT’s director, confirmed that the yellow beans were present in CIAT’s gene bank, and that they had originated in Mexico.
但除了伊朗之外，沙特阿拉伯和其他海湾国家、土耳其和埃及冲突双方等所有主要地区力量想实现这一目标都有充分的理由。	But, Iran aside, all of the region’s major players – Saudi Arabia and its fellow Gulf states, Turkey, and both sides in Egypt – have plenty of reasons to want to see it realized.
现在，剩下的只是朝鲜能不能将核弹头微型化，让洲际弹道导弹携带 — — 这一里程碑估计要不了几年就能实现。	All that is left now is for the North to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to be deliverable by such an ICBM – a milestone that is thought to be not more than a few years off.
但他是在疫情已经酝酿了几个月后才做出的这项决定，经过确诊的埃博拉病例达到6，000起，而且有不少病例尚未被发现。	But his decision came only after the epidemic had been smoldering for many months, with 6,000 Ebola cases confirmed and many more believed to be undetected.
更糟的是，当只有印度百分之一大小的国家在一个接一个的获得金牌而印度运动员只有在失利中才被提到时，我们都感受到了一天又一天等待印度出现在奖牌榜上的羞耻。	Worse yet, we have all known the shame of waiting day after day for India to appear on the list at all, as countries a hundredth our size record gold upon gold and Indian athletes are barely mentioned among the also-rans.
然而，在世界上那么多的连续冲突和没有任何结果的和平进程中，尼泊尔的成功故事应该得到世界的认可和支持。	Yet, amid too many continuing conflicts and failing peace processes around the world, a success story deserves to be recognized and supported.
日本的经济规模大约是美国的一半，其增长动力仍然很弱。 在2008年的第二季度，日本经济以2.4%的年化率收缩，这主要是因为疲弱的出口造成的。	In Japan, with an economy of about half the size of the US, growth forces remain weak. In the second quarter of 2008, the Japanese economy shrank at an annualized rate of 2.4%, primarily due to weak exports.
在国内方面，两党都承诺要治理腐败，颠覆它们所谓的谋私利的政治建制派，同时采取激进政策降低失业、重新分配收入。	On the domestic front, both parties have promised to tackle corruption and topple what they see as a self-serving political establishment, while introducing radical policies to reduce unemployment and redistribute incomes.
尽管日本NSC长期缺位，但对日本来说，现在成立NSC、获得它几乎必将带来的政策方向和一致性改进为时未晚。	Although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue, it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring.
印度环境部部长拉姆·拉梅什说 ： “ 在气候科学和气候传教之间是有清晰的区别的，而我本人站在气候科学这一边 。 ”	India’s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, declared: “There is a fine line between climate science and climate evangelism. I am for climate science.”
他们当代的继承者通过与主流的现代思想的全面接触，力求更好地了解如何通过穆斯林的传统表达伊斯兰的公理。	By engaging fully with the main currents of modern thinking, their contemporary successors seek to better understand how universal principles can be expressed through Muslim tradition.
尽管其他捐助国，包括加拿大和法国，有时会对洪森的侵权行为提出反对意见，但作为拥有最多筹码的美国政府在历史上一直是主要的指控方。	Although other donor countries, such as Canada and France, have at times spoken out against Hun Sen’s abuses, the US government, as the actor wielding the most leverage, has historically led the charge.
凯恩斯在1931年向英国议会提交的《麦克米伦报告（Macmillan Report ） 》 中建议，将进口关税与出口补贴配套使用这将实现与汇率贬值相仿的效应，同时又能维持黄金与英镑的平价关系。	In his 1931 Macmillan Report to the British Parliament, Keynes proposed that an import tariff be paired with an export subsidy, which would mimic the effects of exchange-rate devaluation, while maintaining the gold-pound parity.
通过推进全球化 — — 通过迫使民众吞下更多开放的苦果 — — 他们成功积累了大量财富，然后通过避税、离岸外包和其他见不得人的手段来加以保护。	By advancing globalization – by forcing ever-more openness down the people’s throat – they have accumulated massive wealth, which they then protect through tax avoidance, offshoring, and other schemes.
在功能生，这等价于刺激新一波“僵尸贷款 ” — —20世纪90年代贷给毫无偿债能力的日本借款人的不符合经济学原理的贷款。	This is the functional equivalent of promoting another surge of “zombie lending” – the uneconomic loans made to insolvent Japanese borrowers in the 1990s.
而亚洲基础设施投资银行或许无法做到的则是帮助提升亚洲的经济治理水平 — — 尤其是因为日本，澳大利亚，印尼和韩国这几个GDP总量加起来几乎与中国相等的国家尚未成为银行成员。	What the AIIB may not be able to do is contribute to improved economic governance in Asia – not least because Japan, Australia, Indonesia, and South Korea, whose total GDP is roughly equal to China’s, are not yet members.
还有最后一个令人痛苦的事实：如果说民粹主义的崛起反映了对再分配的要求，那么我们应该看到左翼而非右翼得势。	There is one final prickly fact to consider: if surging populism reflected a demand for redistribution, we would expect the surge to be on the left, not the right.
比如，德国在2003—2006年的改革大大地增加了灵活性（尽管它所处的全球和欧元区条件更为有利 ） 。	For example, the German reforms of 2003-2006 increased flexibility significantly (though in a more benign global and eurozone setting).
但对于可能的税收变化的细节，我仍然要看过去几年中由众议长保罗·瑞恩（Paul Ryan）及其同事们所制定的计划。	But for the details of the potential tax changes, I still look to the plans developed over the past several years by House Speaker Paul Ryan and his colleagues.
当我们回望二十世纪 — — 人类历史上经济增长最为成功的阶段，并作出推断的时候，我们也有带着选择偏误。	There is also the selection bias that we infer from looking at the twentieth century, the most successful in terms of economic growth in human history.
不难预测，这一讨论目前又陷入了国家模式：债权国不反对通缩，因为这增加了它们的投资的价值；而债务国的偿债负担会日益沉重。	The discussion has so far followed easily predictable national patterns: Creditor countries do not object to deflation, because it increases the real value of their investment, whereas debtor countries’ repayment burdens would grow heavier.
由于缺乏大规模常备部队（19世纪70年代，美国海军的规模还比不上智利 ） ， 美国在19世纪全球权力平衡中发挥的作用并不重要。	Lacking a large standing army (and with a navy that in the 1870s was smaller than Chile’s), the US played a minor role in the nineteenth-century global balance of power.
一直有人指责非国家行动者在叙利亚和伊拉克北部使用化学武器，这尤其令人担心，因为这增加了有毒化学品正在用于恐怖袭击的可能性。	Persistent allegations that non-state actors are using chemical weapons in Syria and northern Iraq are of particular concern, as they raise the possibility of toxic chemicals being used in terrorist attacks.
在伊拉克一战中，若美国能获得国际舆论的支持，那么它所采取的行动即使面对否决票也能获得一定的合法性，但是布什总统没有这么做。	In the case of the Iraq War, President Bush never established a broad consensus that might have provided legitimacy in the face of a veto.
尽管意识到美国并不是它一直宣称那样充满机会的事实令世界其他国家的人和美国人一样感到窘迫不安，但全球层面上的机会不平等更严重。	While the realization that America is not the land of opportunity that it has long claimed to be is as disconcerting to others as it is to Americans, inequality of opportunity at the global scale is even greater.
如果欧元想生存下来的话，欧元区成员国必须行动起来，而其他对欧洲一体化有不同程度承诺的成员国则依然处于边缘地位。	If the euro is to survive, eurozone members must act, while other EU members with various levels of commitment to European integration remain on the fringe.
根据一个可靠的、经过同行评议的模型，欧盟减排20%的效果在2100年也只能将变暖推迟两年，而其成本却将是每年约900亿美金。	According to one well-established and peer-reviewed model, the effect of the EU cutting emissions by 20% will postpone warming in 2100 by just two years, yet the cost will be about $90 billion annually.
他们没能看出美国官员认为叙利亚与巴勒斯坦、伊拉克和黎巴嫩领土上的伊斯兰恐怖组织串通一气，大搞恐怖活动。	They fail to see that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamist terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories, Iraq, and Lebanon.
认识到武装或支持任何地方的伊斯兰激进派最终都将助长国际恐怖主义，这样的便利联盟（alliances of convenience）应该避免。	Recognizing that arming or supporting Islamist radicals anywhere ultimately fuels international terrorism, such alliances of convenience should be avoided.
最近的金融危机爆发以来，修正这一失衡的必要性日益凸显，银行重建资本基础（以及满足更严格的监管要求）导致了信用配给现象。	The need to redress that imbalance has become increasingly evident since the recent financial crisis, as banks' efforts to rebuild their capital bases (and meet stricter regulatory requirements) has led to credit rationing.
遏制无序蔓延需要协调性的领地战略，以便各城市能够解决共同的问题，如商品运输、住房和服务集群以及产业走廊的管理和部署。	Limiting sprawl requires a coordinated territorial strategy, so that cities can address common concerns, like the transportation of goods, clustering of housing and services, and management and placement of industrial corridors.
上个月，这位同一个总统所统率的军队把一枚导弹瞄准了一个靠近阿富汗边境的巴基斯坦村庄达马多拉的一个房子。	Last month, the military forces that this same president commands aimed a missile at a house in Damadola, a Pakistani village near the Afghanistan border.
此外，他的提名将引起另一位德国人、欧洲央行理事会唯一的女委员劳腾施莱格尔（Sabine Lautenschläger）辞职。	Moreover, his nomination will trigger the resignation of another German, Sabine Lautenschläger, the only woman on the ECB’s executive board.
造成这种混乱的原因非常复杂，但归根结底，美国、欧洲和国际机构根本不愿为流离失所的穷人考虑是一切混乱的源泉。	Many factors contribute to this disarray, beginning with the shocking inability of the US, Europe, and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people.
与此同时，在俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司对其核心活动，即生产的投资持续下降的情况下，一场危机正在降临，而这需要欧盟出面来掌控局势。	Meanwhile, with investment in Gazprom’s core activity – production – steadily declining, a crisis is looming, one that requires the stewardship and steady hand of the EU.
为了认定是否应该放开人类器官移植或者使用雇佣兵参战，我们需要深刻思考与人类尊严和公民责任有关的问题。	To decide whether we should allow the buying and selling of human organs for transplantation, or hire mercenaries to fight our wars, we have to think through hard questions about human dignity and civic responsibility.
哈佛大学肯尼迪学院的兰特·普里切特为印度发明了一个新专属名词 ： “ 失控的国家 ” — —在这个国家里，能力卓著的政府高层无法控制低效的底层人员，从而影响了执政效率。	Lant Pritchett of the Harvard Kennedy School has coined a new name for India: a “flailing state” – a state where the government’s extremely competent upper echelons are unable to control its inefficient lower levels, resulting in poor performance.
只要拥有核武器依然是国家展示其大国地位最明确的方式，保持核武器的研发能力对伊朗这样的国家就极具诱惑力，甚至不惜作伪证。	As long as possessing nuclear weapons remains a state’s clearest way to demonstrate its bona fides as a great power, maintaining the potential to develop such weapons will be too tempting for countries like Iran to forswear.
但葛里萨的裁决却在鼓励高利贷行为，威胁了国际金融市场的运行，也践踏了现代资本主义的一条基本原则：资不抵债的债务人需要从新开始。	Griesa’s ruling, however, encourages usurious behavior, threatens the functioning of international financial markets, and defies a basic tenet of modern capitalism: insolvent debtors need a fresh start.
在休斯敦，当局为飓风哈维做好了准备，这部分来源于从飓风卡特里娜中所吸取的教训，卡特里娜曾于2005年将新奥尔良变成了一片废墟。	In Houston, authorities were ready for Harvey in part because of lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005.
当选的18名成员中（巴勒斯坦自治机构领导人穆罕默德·阿巴斯随后将增加任命4名成员 ） ， 不超过两位，即只有纳比尔·沙阿斯和穆罕默德·施塔耶是真正的温和派。	Of the 18 elected members (Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas will appoint four more later), no more than two (Nabil Shaath and Muhammad Shtayyeh) are really moderate.
与此同时，科技巨头也可以辩解说，如果它们可以更快地进入效率低下的生产和分销领域，尤其是移动支付，中国的整体生产率增长还能更快。	The tech giants, meanwhile, argue that if they could just move faster into inefficient production and distribution areas, not least mobile payments, productivity growth would accelerate.
坎登的巨大成功促使该基金会又资助了波士顿、克利夫兰、辛辛那提、西密歇根和加州洪堡县（Humboldt County）的类似实验。	The remarkable success in Camden has prompted the foundation to fund similar experiments in Boston, Cleveland, Cincinnati, western Michigan, and Humboldt County, California.
不甘落后的“尼基塔飓风”抓住一切机会搅动外交这趟浑水，边吹口哨边拍桌子 — — 甚至据说脱下鞋子来敲打桌面。	Not to be outdone, “Hurricane Nikita” used every opportunity to stir the diplomatic pot, whistling and banging his fists – and even, allegedly, his shoe – on the desk.
一些民主党人放下了他们的民族自豪感，说最近被《时代》杂志冠以欧洲国王名号的法国的年轻总统马克龙更适合介入接手伊拉克和伊朗问题。	Some Democrats swallow their national pride and say that France’s young president, Emmanuel Macron, newly crowned by Time magazine as king of Europe, is in a better position to step in and stay the hand of Iraq and Iran.
上个月，默克尔宣布自己不会再寻求连任总理，并且将在今年年底辞去基督教民主联盟（简称基民盟）的领导职务。	Last month, Merkel announced that she would not be seeking another term as chancellor, and that at the end of this year, she would step down as leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
在2007年“藏红花革命 ” （ Saffron Revolution）中勇敢面对缅甸军方的和尚，如今正在对该国穆斯林罗兴亚人行使暴力。	Some of the same Buddhist monks who braved Myanmar’s military junta in the “Saffron Revolution” of 2007 today incite violence against members of the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority.
人们对发生另一场欧洲战争的担忧促成了欧洲统一的梦想，天真地希望独立国家已经过时并将让位于出众的欧洲人，这种希望支持着该梦想，这个不切实际的梦想破灭了吗？	Was the dream of a unified Europe – inspired by fears of another European war, and sustained by the idealistic hope that nation-states were obsolete and would give way to good Europeans – a utopian dead end?
同时，在土耳其对待它的邻国的态度转变的时候，它的统治精英已经注意到欧盟把那些拥有更弱小市场经济和更短的民主历史的前共产主义国家接纳为会员。	Meanwhile, as Turkey’s attitude toward its neighbors has changed, its governing elite has watched the EU embrace ex-communist countries with far shakier market economies and shorter democratic records.
如果作为伯克（Edmund Burke）和贝恩（Tony Benn）的故乡的英国可以发生这种事，其他地方绝对也可以发生。	If it can happen here – in the homeland of Edmund Burke and Tony Benn – it truly can happen anywhere.
更令人担心的是强大的新网络、生物和纳米技术带来的不利风险：通过错误或者恐怖，一小撮人可能带来社会的急速崩塌，政府根本来不及响应。	Even more worrying are the downside risks of powerful new cyber, bio, and nanotechnologies: A few individuals, via error or terror, could ignite a societal breakdown so quickly that government responses would be overwhelmed.
因此，张成泽的处决是对中国国家主席习近平的直接挑战 — — 在常规情形中，这一动作将使中国中止、至少暂时削减对朝支持。	Chang’s execution was thus a straightforward challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping – a move that, under normal circumstances, would prompt China to suspend, or at least reduce, its support for North Korea.
美国尤其如此，市场非常欢迎美联储延长近零利率（负真实利率）政策、激进的政策指导以及资产购买方案的三管齐下 — — 所有这些都让投资者更多地承担风险。	This is most evident in the US, where markets love the Federal Reserve’s trifecta of near-zero policy interest rates (negative in real terms), aggressive forward policy guidance, and asset purchases – all of which push investors to take more risk.
也许约翰·斯坦贝克（John Steinbeck）说得对 ： “ 社会主义之所以未能在美国扎根，是因为穷人总觉得自己不是被剥削的无产阶级，而是暂时陷入困境的百万富翁 。 ”	Perhaps John Steinbeck got it right when he supposedly said that, “Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.”
实际上他们把注意力都放在了美国的外债上，却忽视了家庭负债（抵押贷款和消费者债务 ） 、 公共负债，商业债务和金融债务等方面的问题。	Instead, they focused exclusively on US foreign debt, ignoring household debt (mortgage and consumer debt), public debt, business debt, and financial debt.
考虑到我们面临的挑战（IPCC已清楚阐明其量级和性质 ） ， 下半年的哥本哈根会议必须就充分处理气候变化问题达成多边协议。	Given the challenge facing us, the magnitude and nature of which were clearly brought out by the IPCC, the Copenhagen Conference later this year must produce a multi-lateral agreement that deals adequately with climate change.
库尔德地区在朝自治的方向前进，而逊尼派受到宗教色彩强烈的、由什叶派主导的威权中央政府的排挤，日渐被边缘化。	Kurdistan has embarked on a path toward increased autonomy, while the Sunnis are increasingly marginalized by a sectarian and authoritarian Shia-dominated central government.
美国发动阿富汗战争以来已导致超过40,000名平民丧生，因为巴基斯坦政府与助其掌权的势力展开了罪恶的合作。	More than 40,000 citizens have been killed since the beginning of the US war in Afghanistan, because Pakistan’s government criminally collaborates with forces that facilitated its rise to power.
博岑（波尔扎诺）的贷款成本是临近的因斯布鲁克的两倍，这是完全不合理的；事实上，如此武断的差异只能破坏竞争，导致经济停滞。	There is no reason why loans in Bozen (Bolzano) should cost twice as much as those in nearby Innsbruck; in fact, such arbitrary divergences merely undermine competition and cause economic stagnation.
这些天来，我一直在想这一挑战。 因为我的新项目HICCup（健康计划协调委员会，Health Initiative Coordinating Council）旨在（部分地）帮助大量的人这样做，尽管一开始该项目的对象只局限在少数社区。	I think about this challenge a lot these days, because my new startup, called HICCup (Health Initiative Coordinating Council), aims (in part) to help people do just that on a massive scale, though initially concentrated in just a few communities.
那些在这一领域的人了解这项技术，其中一些人还会按照商定的标准来设计这项技术；但不能让他们独自去制定这些标准。	Those in the field know the technology and will be the ones to design it according to agreed standards; but they must not decide alone what those standards will be.
包括机器人在内的先进制造技术意味着创造出的少数工作将需要更高的技能，将被安置在那些与流失就业岗位所在地不同的地点。	Advanced manufacturing technology, including robots, means that the few jobs created will require higher skills and will be placed at different locations than the jobs that were lost.
这一思维状态的受益者是反建制候选人，他们力挺反对自由贸易和移民改革，要求彻底改变当前税收和支出政策。	The beneficiaries of this state of mind are anti-establishment candidates who espouse policies in opposition to free trade and immigration reform and who call for a radical overhaul of current tax and spending policies.
比如马尔万·巴尔豪迪这个依然在押的暴力活动领袖就获选为中央委员会的新成员，而中央委员会则是法塔赫的最高执行机构。	A jailed intifada leader, Marwan Barghouti, was among the highest elected new leaders to the central committee, the movement’s executive body.
也许是担心导致更大的社会动荡，因此西西至今仍未满足去年11月国际货币基金组织（IMF）所提出的作为其120亿美元援助计划的一部分的条件。	Perhaps fearing even greater social unrest, Sisi has yet to meet the conditions set last November by the International Monetary Fund as part of a $12 billion bailout.
但为何当选总统比君主更适合刺激关于社会价值和当务之急的公共争论？ 最重要的原因是他更有可能具有出众的能力。	But the most important reason why an elected president is better equipped than a monarch to catalyze a public conversation about a society’s values and priorities is that he or she is more likely to be a person of superior ability.
就业问题甚至可能被进一步利用，发展中国家常见的工作环境差、工资水平低、童工和其它问题也无一例外成了博取支持的武器。	The jobs issue could be exploited further by citing poor working conditions, low wages, child labor, and other problems commonly found in developing countries.
而欧洲当局推迟了重要的难民政策决定，以避免对英国全民公决造成消极影响，从而让加莱等地的乱象持久持续。	And the European authorities delayed important decisions on refugee policy in order to avoid a negative effect on the British referendum vote, thereby perpetuating scenes of chaos like the one in Calais.
从1980年以来，全球能源需求增加了50%以上，而且预计将会从现在起到2030年每年增加1.6 % 。	Worldwide energy demand has increased by more than 50% since 1980, and is expected to grow annually by 1.6% between now and 2030.
泥浆、垃圾和人的排泄物构成了苦难的岩浆，带刺铁丝网和官方的冷漠 — — 欧盟和希腊当局提供的少得可怜的资源就是明证 — — 构成了地狱界。	Mud, refuse, and human excrement formed a magma of misery, a hellscape surrounded by barbed wire and the official indifference reflected in the puny resources provided by the European Union and Greek authorities.
因为在1960年代，包括美国前总统约翰·F·肯尼迪在内许多人都曾经认为到今天世界上将存在数十个拥有核武器的国家，而且这些国家极有可能会动用核武器。	Many people, including President John F. Kennedy, believed in the 1960’s that there would be dozens of countries with nuclear weapons by now, and that their use would be highly probable.
在特朗普就任总统期间和在那之后，上述转移将只会加速，除非为了保住美国来之不易且代价昂贵的全球优势而做出重大的变革。	That shift will only accelerate further during and after Trump’s presidency, unless major changes are made to retain America’s costly, hard-earned global preeminence.
这部现在被引为电视史上收视率最高的纪录片《浩劫后》使得美国总统罗纳德·里根感到“万分沮丧 ” ， 并重新思考自己的核战略。	The Day After, now cited as the highest-rated film in TV history, left then-US President Ronald Reagan “greatly depressed” and caused him to rethink his nuclear strategy.
确实，看起来克里姆林宫的每个人都在阅读纳粹法学家施密特的著作。 施密特教诲说，指出你的敌人是政治的中心使命。	Indeed, it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt, the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics.
如果希腊等国想���保未来几十年国内民众的健康和繁荣，他们就必须想法设法防止当前经济活动进一步加剧本已不可持续的环境债务。	If Greece and other countries are to ensure the health and prosperity of their citizens in the decades to come, they will have to find a way to prevent current economic activity from increasing an already unsustainable burden of environmental debt.
结果，这些国家中的城市被一一铲平，杀害平民的不仅有纳粹，还有入侵波兰为纳粹德国国防军提供西线战争所需物资的苏联军队。	As a result, cities in those countries were flattened and people killed not only by the Nazis, but also by their Soviet ally, which invaded Poland and supplied the Wehrmacht with the material it needed for its war against the West.
我们并不是那么习惯于以促进清洁能源、霍乱疫苗或者帮助非洲贫困农民抵御干旱的作物等新技术来思考全球合作问题。	We are less accustomed to thinking of global cooperation to promote new technologies, such as clean energy, a malaria vaccine, or drought-resistant crops to help poor African farmers.
即使签订了核协议并得到了实施，也不能影响这一现实，反而有可能让形势变得更加糟糕，因为伊朗可能会获得更好的名声，并且其建造核武器的长期选择并未受到影响。	Even a nuclear agreement that is signed and implemented will not affect this reality and might even make it worse, as Iran could well emerge with its reputation enhanced and a long-term option to build nuclear weapons intact.
此外，如 波兰总理塔斯克（Donald Tusk）所提出的，欧盟应该认真思考将能源采购从第三方手中集中过来。	Moreover, the EU should contemplate centralizing the purchase of energy from third parties, as proposed by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.
梅在访问华盛顿时就采用了这种策略，她在特朗普在联合记者会上公开声明支持酷刑时默默站在一边什么都没说。	That is the approach May took on her visit to Washington, DC, when she stood by silently as Trump openly declared his support for the use of torture at their joint press conference.
此外，我们的公务员注重解决问题，表现出一定程度的足智多谋，发明了许多地方化的方案以解决诸如确保食品安全、清洁水和住房的充足供应等人类发展挑战。	Moreover, our civil servants embrace problem solving, demonstrating a level of resourcefulness that has produced many localized solutions to human development challenges such as ensuring food security and adequate supplies of clean water and housing.
到2030年，它希望能够从可再生能源中获取40％的电力供应，最早从2022年开始通过太阳能发电获得100兆瓦的电力。	It hopes to generate 40% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, and it expects 100 gigawatts of that to come from solar energy by as early as 2022.
2008年穆沙拉夫在民众压力下辞职，在随后的新一轮选举中贝纳齐尔·布托（在去年12月死于暗杀）的鳏夫阿西夫·扎尔达里（Asif Zardari）胜出并担任总统职务。	In 2008, Musharraf resigned under popular pressure, and a new election brought Asif Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, who had been assassinated the previous December, to the presidency.
他们认为如倘若欧洲真的想作为全球事务参与者被受到重视的话，就必须在送钱的同时展示一下自己的一身肌肉。	If Europe is to be taken seriously as a global player, they argue, it must also flex some muscle when it delivers the money.
As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.	Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.
传统上，低收入国家的债权人是富裕国家政府和多边机构，如果索债意味着借款国必须削减教育和卫生等关键公共服务，就会饱受政治压力。	Traditionally, low-income countries’ creditors were rich-world governments and multilateral organizations that found it politically unfeasible to call in debts if this meant that borrowers had to cut vital public services such as education or health.
发自雅典 — — 当欧元区建立之时，它的缔造者们希望它能逐渐朝着以财政统一，人员自由流动以及政治联盟为特点的“优化货币区 ” 。	ATHENS – When the eurozone was established, its creators envisioned gradual progress toward an “optimal currency area,” characterized by fiscal integration, the free movement of labor, and political union.
更重要的是在过去10年间，铀矿的开采只能满足全世界核能发电燃料总需求量的2/3 — — 2010年度需求量约为6.8万当量吨天然铀。	Furthermore, during the past 10 years, only about two-thirds of worldwide demand for nuclear fuel – about 68,000 tons of natural uranium equivalent are needed for 2010 – was met from resources obtained from mining.
这差不多等于美国与1951年的日本，1967年的新加坡，1975年的台湾，1977年的韩国之间的差距 — — 这四个国家正是发展委员会研究的13个成功的经济体中的4个。	That is roughly the same gap that existed between the US and Japan in 1951, Singapore in 1967, Taiwan in 1975, and South Korea in 1977 – four economies that are also among the 13 successful economies studied by the Growth Commission.
一项针对总统修辞学方面的详细研究也证明即便是富兰克林·罗斯福或者罗纳德·里根这样的著名演说家都无法仅靠个人魅力来推动政策项目。	One careful study of presidential rhetoric found that even such famous orators as Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan could not count on charisma to enact their programs.
欧洲人不应该为了促进贸易而损害他们对隐私的真正关注，因为贸易（有时）只是实现更高生活水平的手段而已。	Europeans should not have to compromise their genuinely held concerns about privacy just to promote trade, which is simply a means (sometimes) to achieving higher living standards.
但是，尽管这并没有实现，但欧洲原则也显然没有失去吸引力，最近乌克兰总统亚努科维奇决定与欧洲决裂的消息引起乌克兰人民示威游行就是明证。	But, while that did not occur, European principles certainly have not lost their allure, as recent protests in Ukraine, triggered by President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to shun closer ties with Europe, have shown.
即使这种错误的激励措施都被避免，为了控制成本, 还有更棘手的问题需要面对。 其中之一就是新药物的花费。	Development costs have to be passed on in drug prices, which may be exceptionally high when a drug benefits only a relatively small number of patients.
据国际货币基金组织（IMF ） ， 2009—2016年世界贸易量年增长平均刚刚超过3 % — —只有1980—2008年期间6%的一半。	According to the International Monetary Fund, annual growth in the volume of world trade has averaged just 3% over the 2009-2016 period – half the 6% rate from 1980 to 2008.
除了美国士兵在监狱内外的暴力之外，伊拉克妇女每天都面临来自武装人员假借宗教和“解放”名义施加的暴力。	In addition to violence by US troops inside and outside of prisons, women in Iraq face daily violence from militants under the guise of religion and “liberation.”
但伊朗的不光彩的遗产 — — 从197年人质危机到如今的干涉叙利亚 — — 不是许多美国决策者可以轻易原谅或忘却的。	But the country’s dark legacy, from the hostage crisis in 1979 to its involvement in Syria today, is not one that many US policymakers will readily forgive or forget.
鉴于法官的同业公会在过去半个世纪以来一直对行政权力之争保持相对独立的姿态，所以这一决定是向更公平的选举迈进了一大步。	This was a major step toward fairer elections, as the judges’ professional union has remained fairly independent over the past half-century of executive power grabs.
官方的统计数字很可能高估了经济增长水平，因为该统计忽略了一些重要事实，即小企业的经营情绪（business sentiment）极其低落，它们的产出仍在急剧下滑。	But official measures of GDP may grossly overstate growth in the economy as they don't capture the fact that business sentiment among small firms is abysmal and their output is still falling sharply.
一些大学成立了委员会，就大学受托人投资组合中的环境、社会和治理（ESG）相关内容提供建议，最常见的情形是要举行支持ESG方案的代理投票时。	Several have committees that advise university trustees on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in their portfolio, most commonly when proxy votes in support of ESG proposals are to be held.
成为真正的全球领袖意味着决定和联结市场赖以运行的全球经济结构 — — 美国承担这一角色已接近70年。	Being a true global leader means shaping and connecting the global economic structures within which states and markets operate – something the US has been doing for almost 70 years.
短期和长期的政策也因此紧密地联系了起来；除非临时应急措施能与根本性的长期结构改革相结合，另一个与目前类似（甚至更加恶劣的）灾难将在劫难逃。	Short-term and long-term policies are therefore closely related; unless temporary stopgaps are combined with fundamental long-term structural reform, another disaster like the current one – or worse – will become inevitable.
公民社会团体、政治党派、联合国甚至一些企业利益集团都强烈反对该立法，因此政府的这一行为是难以理解和宽恕的。	Given strong opposition from civil-society groups, political parties, the United Nations, and even some business interests, the government’s behavior was both understandable and inexcusable.
比如，作为下一个即将面临选举的主要领导人的英国首相托尼·布莱尔大打人格魅力牌并大谈政治事务，但是他代表的毕竟是中层阶级的价值观。	For example, Prime Minister Tony Blair, the next major leader to face an election, plays the personality card and talks about policies, but he represents above all a set of middle-class values.
美国梦正在让位给阶级意识 — — 对于这个建立在人人都能通过努力工作改善生活的理想的国家来说，这是个影响深远的变化。	The American Dream is giving way to class consciousness – a profound change for a country founded on the ideal that anyone can improve his or her lot through hard work.
根据世界银行的统计，彻底消除所有的商品贸易障碍对发展中国家收入的最终推进比例不超过1 % ， 对发达国家收入的影响就更小了。	According to World Bank estimates, complete elimination of all merchandise trade restrictions would ultimately boost developing-country incomes by no more than 1%. The impact on developed-country incomes would be even smaller.
WWF全球总干事詹姆斯·李普（James Leape）解释说，它提供了一个“全球平台，使亿万人可以表达他们对气候变化的灾难性后果的担忧之情 。 ”	As WWF Director-General James Leape explained, it provides “a global platform for millions of people to voice their concern about the devastating effects of climate change.”
此外，能源和食品价格的波动非常剧烈而且基本上不可预测，与此同时，其价格的变化速度也随着这种波动越来越快。	Moreover, energy and food price shocks can be both large and largely unpredictable, while the speed of price changes tends to increase with big shocks.
伦敦 — “ 那个在你手指上的钻石，说一下它是怎么样变成你的 ？ ” 莎士比亚笔下的辛柏林（Cymbeline）问。	LONDON – “That diamond upon your finger, say how came it yours?” asks Shakespeare’s Cymbeline.
比如我的一位亲戚眼睛出了毛病，她的医生将其转给了另一个眼科医生，但眼科医生检查之后认为没必要做手术，于是又把她转回去了原来的医生处。	A member of my family recently had an eye problem, and was referred by her general practitioner to an eye surgeon. The surgeon examined the eye, said that it didn’t need surgery, and sent her back to the general practitioner.
但这一建议不但受到担心国际货币基金组织对问题债务国太友好的债权国的反对，也受到预料到近期信誉可能遭到质疑的新兴市场的反对。	But the proposal faced sharp opposition not only from creditors who feared that the IMF would be too friendly to problem debtors, but also from emerging markets that foresaw no near-term risk to their perceived creditworthiness.
像今年这样的厄尔尼诺相关天气事件（更准确地说应该是“厄尔尼诺南部震荡 ” ） 的影响因为其全球效应而显得尤其巨大。	The impact of El Niño-related weather events like the one this year (known more precisely as “El Niño Southern Oscillation” events) can be especially large because of their global reach.
他未能充分认识到这些战斗人员对土耳其自身安全造成的威胁，尤其当伊斯兰教附属团体的诸多参与者对土耳其怀有的敌意并不逊于阿萨德。	He failed to recognize fully the danger these fighters posed to Turkey’s own security, particularly as many of them joined Islamist-affiliated groups that are as hostile to Turkey as they are to Assad.
这一减税方案应该与经济状况挂钩，随着就业的复苏（比如就业人口占总人口比例恢复到2007年水平时）而降级。	These tax cuts should also be linked to the state of the economy, so that they would wind down as employment recovers (for example, to its level in 2007, relative to total population).
奥巴马总统在亚洲推进了TPP，但知道最近才要求国会授予便宜行事谈判权（即要求国会进行投票表决并且不对方案进行修订 ） 。	President Barack Obama has promoted the TPP in Asia, but he only recently asked Congress for fast-track negotiating authority (the ability to request an up-or-down congressional vote without amendments).
他把他的正义和发展党（Justice and Development Party）发展成了穆斯林世界的欧洲基督民主（Christian Democratic）党，将经济增长、反腐���政策和自由选举相结合。	He presented his Justice and Development Party as the Muslim equivalent of Europe’s Christian Democratic parties, combining economic growth, anti-corruption policies, and free elections.
有122个国家赞成了该条约，但一个国家反对，一个国家弃权，另有69个国家，包括有核国家和北约成员国，没有投票。	Whereas 122 countries voted for it, one voted against, one abstained, and 69, including the nuclear powers and NATO members, did not vote.
一方面，利比亚伊斯兰主义者与埃及穆斯林兄弟会和突尼斯复兴运动党（Ennahda）有一个显著不同 — — 制度化水平和群众互动。	A striking difference between Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood and Tunisia’s Ennahda, on the one hand, and Libya’s Islamists on the other is the level of institutionalization and interaction with the masses.
如果我们不去应对那个自由金融市场可以催生有害杠杆水平的根本现实，就等于没有在2008年危机中汲取最重要的教训。	If we do not address the fundamental fact that free financial markets can generate harmful levels of private-sector leverage, we will not have learned the most important lesson of the 2008 crisis.
这与其他强人的方针形成了鲜明对比。 比如，已故的委内瑞拉领导人查韦斯用漫长的石油繁荣的收入来支撑慷慨的社会福利计划，以此来维持公共支持率。	This contrasts sharply with the approach of, say, Venezuela’s late strongman leader Hugo Chávez, who maintained popular support for 14 years by spending the proceeds of a long oil-price boom on generous social programs.
与NCD相关的身体和经济负担最重的正是那些最容易受影响的国家：中低收入国家占了NCD相关死亡人数的80 % 。	The physical and economic burdens associated with NCDs fall the hardest where they are least easily borne: low- and middle-income countries, where 80% of NCD-related deaths occur.
法国很久以来以让·雅克·卢梭的哲学体系为特色，一直把公意的代表，也就是法律尊奉为最高等级的司法规范。	France has long been characterized by Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s philosophy, which placed the law – the expression of the General Will – at the absolute top of the hierarchy of judicial norms.
简言之，在萨默斯所预言的长期停滞中，低利率是抵消低投资回报的必要条件，而长期停滞的发生很有可能是拜戈登所强调的提振生产率的技术变革发展缓慢所赐。	In short, the secular stagnation that Summers has predicted, with low interest rates being necessary to offset low returns on investment, could well be caused by the slowdown in productivity-enhancing technological change that Gordon highlights.
另一个讽刺之处是，新兴世界所需要的大部分投资项目是长期项目，大量可用储蓄 — — 退休账户、养老基金和主权财富基金拥有数万亿美元 — — 亦然。	There is another irony. Most of the investment projects that the emerging world needs are long term, as are much of the available savings – the trillions in retirement accounts, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds.
欧盟一位高级官员解释其中的含义说 ： “ 在最近一段时间，有很多案例显示要么是巴基斯坦人潜入欧洲，要么是欧盟公民奔赴巴基斯坦参加培训并被洗脑 。 ”	A senior EU official spelled out what this means: there had been “many cases in the recent past where either Pakistanis were coming to Europe or young EU citizens were going to Pakistan for training and being brainwashed.”
但他们确实发现了阿族目击者指称科索沃解放军将被俘的塞尔维亚人、阿尔巴尼亚人和罗马人带到阿尔巴尼亚，并在阿境内将他们杀害。	They did, however, find Albanian witnesses who asserted that UCK members took captured Serbs, Albanians, and Roma into Albania, where they were killed.
我本人是五零后，我感到羞愧和懊恼的是，我担心我们这代人在发达经济体将作为丧失经济主动权的一代被载入史册。	I am in my late fifties, and I worry that our generation in the advanced world will be remembered – to our shame and chagrin – as the one that lost the economic plot.
如果美国的目的是给伊朗放风 — — “当心，没准你就是下个目标 ” — —那么很多人会质疑美国是否真的想约束以色列。	If America’s purpose is to deliver a message to Iran – “Beware, you could be the next target” – many will question its sincerity about restraining Israel.
正如2015年国际货币基金组织《世界经济展望》报告所显示的那样，尽管某些国家可能处于全球价值链上游，但汇率对出口增长仍然很重要。	As the 2015 IMF World Economic Outlook report shows, despite the rise of global value chains, the exchange rate still matters for export growth.
投资者-国家纠纷解决（ISDS）条款允许外国投资者在新监管规则降低了他们的预期未来利润时追求有法律约束力的针对政府的仲裁。	Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions allow foreign investors to pursue binding private arbitration against governments if new regulations reduce their expected future profits.
20世纪70年代，印度取消了药品专利，逐步形成了能为发展中国家民众提供平价药品的先进、高效的仿制药行业。	In the 1970s, India abolished pharmaceutical patents, creating an advanced and efficient generics industry capable of providing affordable medicines to people throughout the developing world.
由于负面财富效应以及不确定性增加，10月份消费支出大幅下降，但随后又迅速回稳，投资支出基本保持不变。	Consumer spending dropped sharply in October, owing to negative wealth effects and heightened uncertainty, but it quickly stabilized and recovered, while investment spending remained essentially unchanged.
集体诉讼条款可以强制执行大部分债权人接受的条件，已经成为主权债务的标准条款，但2001年危机爆发之前所发行的阿根廷债务并不包含此项条款。	These clauses became standard in sovereign bonds but were missing in those issued by Argentina before 2001, when the crisis hit.
现在，制宪会议中几乎1/3的成员是妇女 — — 这一比例在南亚是最高的，在世界各国由全国选民选举的机构中排名14。	Now nearly one-third of the Constituent Assembly’s members are women – the highest proportion in South Asia and fourteenth place in the world for nationally elected bodies.
新抗癌药物或更快速的计算机这样的创新应该惠及全人类 — — 而不仅仅是幸运地生在实现这些发现的国家的人。	Innovations like new cancer drugs or faster computing should benefit people everywhere – not only those fortunate enough to live in the country where the discoveries happen to have been developed.
这是一个需要考虑的重要问题，因为人们相对来说较少关注一个紧密相关、同样重要的人类生存威胁：令人吃惊的全球生物多样性丧失速度。	That is an important question to consider, in view of the relative lack of attention devoted to a closely related and equally important threat to human survival: the startling pace of global biodiversity loss.
大约就是在1948年到1973年这一阶段，社会学家们开始发现，大部分美国人开始将自己定位为中产阶级而不是工人阶级了。	It was during this era – roughly from 1948 to 1973 – that sociologists found that a majority of Americans had come to define themselves not as working class, but as middle class.
面对主要来自中东和非洲地区的持续移民和难民涌入，欧洲选民已经将近期一系列选举转化成了有关移民问题的公投行动。	Faced with a sustained influx of refugees and migrants, primarily from the Middle East and Africa, European voters have transformed a series of recent elections into popular referenda on immigration.
受夏洛特维尔事件的刺激，英国也出现了一批人想要将著名的伦敦特拉法加广场的纳尔逊将军雕像移除，因为这位英国海军英雄支持奴隶贸易。	Inspired by the events taking place in Charlottesville, advocates have emerged in Britain seeking to pull Admiral Nelson off his famous column on Trafalgar Square in London, because the British naval hero supported the slave trade.
正如卡门·莱因哈特与肯尼思·罗格夫最近发表的一篇国际货币基金组织论文所指出的那样，那些发达经济都面临着一些无法仅仅借助一系列紧缩，拖延和增长就能消除的债务负担。	As a recent IMF paper by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff illustrates, advanced economies face debt burdens that cannot be reduced simply through a mix of austerity, forbearance, and growth.
柏林 — — 2001年9月11日的“基地”组织恐怖袭击后美国已发动对“基地”组织、阿富汗和伊拉克的三次战争。	BERLIN – The United States has waged three wars since Al Qaeda’s terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001: against Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan, and in Iraq.
有些人希望高级军备贸易也能在这一新型合作中有所体现 — — 这一观点最近正在推动欧盟解除对华实施长达15年的军售禁令。	Some want that partnership to include trade in advanced weaponry—witness the recent push to remove the EU’s 15-year-old ban on arms sales to China.
复苏赢得了动力（特别是在一些发达经济体 ） ， 但世界经济仍然没有达到马力全开的状态 — — 未来几年可能将依然处于动力不足的状态。	While recovery gained momentum, particularly in some advanced economies, the world economy is not yet flying on all engines – and is likely to remain underpowered next year as well.
包括古斯塔夫·克虏伯（Gustav Krupp ） 、 弗雷德里希·弗里克（Friedrich Flick ） 、 弗里茨·冯·欧宝（Fritz von Opel）在内的20多位德国顶级产业家听取了希特勒的演讲，他承诺他们的资产可以在他的统治下保全。	More than 20 of Germany’s top industrialists, including Gustav Krupp, Friedrich Flick, and Fritz von Opel, listened to a speech by Hitler, who promised them that their assets would be safe under his rule.
其一是中国主席习近平提出的“修西得底斯陷阱 ” ， 指的是古希腊历史学家修西得底斯警告如果一个现有大国（如美国）太过恐惧一个正在崛起的大国（如中国 ） ， 那就有可能爆发灾难性的战争。	The “Thucydides Trap,” cited by Chinese President Xi Jinping, refers to the warning by the ancient Greek historian that cataclysmic war can erupt if an established power (like the United States) becomes too fearful of a rising power (like China).
首先，危机爆发时，时任IMF总裁斯特劳斯-卡恩（Dominique Strauss-Kahn）在法国总统选举中领先。	For starters, at the onset of the crisis, then-IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn was a leading candidate to become President of France.
但时间是最重要的因素；外交手段需要加快进程，否则就会被伊朗核武器发展进度赶上，果真如此，西方真得面临冲突了。	But time is of the essence; diplomacy needs to move faster if it is not to be overtaken by Iran’s march to a nuclear weapon – and, with it, the march to conflict.
与此同时，全国人本发展计划（National Initiative for Human Development）帮助摩洛哥最脆弱公民群体（特别是女性）摆脱贫困、融入社会。	Meanwhile, a new National Initiative for Human Development is helping to end poverty and social exclusion among Morocco’s most vulnerable citizens, especially women.
对于军政府的将军们来说，这一点使得他们的退却痛苦得犹如伤口上撒盐。 因为此前，东盟一直是缅甸抵御国际社会压力的最坚实的挡箭牌之一。	This must have made the retreat doubly painful for the generals, as ASEAN was previously one of the junta’s strongest shields against international pressure.
英国臭鼬大麻的HTC水平较高，而几乎不含CBD；另一方面，hash大麻的HTC和CBD含量基本相同。	Skunk in the UK has high levels of THC while being virtually devoid of CBD; hash, on the other hand, has roughly equal quantities of the two components.
不幸的是，到目前为止，欧盟国家针对民粹主义威胁作出了与20世纪30年代以邻为壑的保护主义政策相类似的回应，每个国家都试图将问题推给其他国家，直到最终所有国家面对问题都无法继续逃避。	Unfortunately, the response to populist gains so far has been similar to the beggar-thy-neighbor response to protectionism in the 1930s, with each country trying to shift the problem on to others until it comes back to bite everyone.
尽管房地产投资的大幅下降会给中国的经济增长带来严重负面影响 — — 这一点可以也应该预防 — — 但只要跌幅不是太猛，对中国就是利大于弊的。	Although a significant decline in real-estate investment will have a very serious negative impact on China’s growth – which can and should be prevented – as long as the fall is not too drastic, it is a welcome development.
以色列阿拉伯人将被要求将国籍、国民身份和投票权 — — 但不包括敌据点 — — 转换至新的巴勒斯坦国。	Israeli Arabs would then be required to transfer their citizenship, national identity, and national voting rights – but not their residence – to the new Palestinian state.
而美国的贸易伙伴们自然会对这一强加的关税实施报复 — — 这正是今年早些时候实施钢铁和铝关税之后发生的事情。	There would naturally be retaliation in the form of higher tariffs imposed by America’s trading partners, which is exactly what happened after the steel and aluminum tariffs were imposed earlier this year.
而在法国，一个大胆出格的说法就是除非恢复其货币主权，否则就将陷入比以往任何时候都更深层次的经济萎缩之中。	In France, the idea that now dares to speak its name is that the country will sink into an ever-deeper economic malaise unless it regains its monetary sovereignty.
我担心这意味着过早地从消费者拉动模式回到中国的舒适区 — — 长期以来更加顺从于中央计划的产业工程的生产者模式。	I worry that it could indicate a premature shift away from the consumer-led model back to China’s comfort zone of a producer model that has long been more amenable to the industrial engineering of central planning.
其说辞 — — 至少从一方看 — — 类似于丘吉尔1946年的《铁幕》演说。 丘吉尔的这次演说是冷战拉开序幕的标志性事件之一。	And the rhetoric – at least from one side – has come to resemble that of Winston Churchill’s 1946 “Iron Curtain” speech, one of the inaugural events of the Cold War.
正如前总理唐纳德·图斯克在推特上所评论的那样 ： “ 那些散布‘波兰死亡集中营’这个伪词汇的人正在损害波兰的良好声誉和利益。	As former Prime Minister Donald Tusk commented on Twitter: “Whoever spreads the false phrase ‘Polish death camps’ is harming Poland’s good name and its interests.
根据国际妇女研究中心和世界银行的数据，终结童婚可以节省出数十亿美元的年度福利开支，到2030年时总共为全球节省超过4万亿美元。	According to the International Center for Research on Women and the World Bank, ending the practice of child marriage would save billions of dollars in annual welfare expenditures, resulting in global savings of more than $4 trillion by 2030.
比如，在中东，身份政治正在以最邪恶的形式展现：逊尼派和什叶派之间的混乱而暴力的冲突，伊斯兰国的崛起就是明证。	In the Middle East, for example, identity politics is manifesting itself in its most sinister form: a chaotic and violent clash between Sunni and Shia Muslims, exemplified by the rise of the Islamic State.
今年晚些时候，IMF将重新制定其账户单位 — — 由目前包括美国、欧元、英镑和日元的一揽子货币所组成的所谓的特别提款权的权重。	Later this year, the IMF will recalibrate the weights in its unit of account, the so-called Special Drawing Rights, which comprises a basket of currencies that currently includes the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen.
拜所有这些因素所赐，赢家和输家的平衡变得更加极端和难以管理，不仅经济上是如此，政治和社会上也是如此。	As a result of all of this, the balance of winners and losers has become increasingly extreme and more difficult to manage, not just economically, but also politically and socially.
尽管我十分希望他们最终能被证明是正确的，但最新的疲软经济数字（包括5月就业岗位净增量仅仅69000个）确认了我的怀疑。	While I hoped that they might be proven right, the recent stream of weak economic data, including May’s timid net job creation of only 69,000, confirmed my doubts.
尽管如此，中国人民银行的战术性决定也存在潜在漏洞，因为这鼓励了信用规模扩张，而中国正在竭力摆脱债务密集型增长。	Nonetheless, the PBOC’s tactical decision is not without potential pitfalls – not least because interest-rate cuts encourage the extension of more credit at a time when China is trying to wean itself from debt-intensive growth.
当面临这个挑战时，其过程很有可能是局部且不平衡的，它会突显出一些差异性，并在国家、地区及全球层面上产生棘手的协调问题。	And, when it is met, the process will most likely be partial and uneven, accentuating differences and posing tricky coordination issues at the national, regional, and global levels.
由于三分之一的选民认为他胜之不武，再加上墨西哥法治目前的微妙处境，卡尔德龙所处的地位就更加不值得羡慕。	Given that roughly a third of the electorate does not think he won fairly, and in view of the precariousness of the rule of law in the country, Calderón’s position is even less enviable.
最近中国获得斯里兰卡汉班托塔港99年的租赁权，而按照纳希德的说法，中国还从债务深重的马尔代夫手中收购了17 个岛礁用作投资用途。	Just as China recently secured the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota on a 99-year lease, it has, according to Nasheed, quietly acquired 17 islands in the heavily indebted Maldives for investment purposes.
毕竟，在核惩罚因太过严厉而缺乏可信度的情况下，美国采取了常规的灵活策略，在遏制苏联入侵西欧的行动中加入了防卫的元素。	After all, when nuclear punishment seemed too draconian to be credible, the US adopted a conventional flexible response to add an element of denial in its effort to deter a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.
政府还应当拨出充足的国内资金实现上述目标，比方说非洲国家首脑切实履行2001年阿布贾宣言承诺，拿出国家预算的至少15%投资公共卫生部门。	Governments would also be expected to allocate adequate domestic funds to achieve these goals, with, for example, African heads of state fulfilling the 2001 Abuja Declaration’s pledge to allocate at least 15% of national budgets to the health sector.
对欧洲银行来说 — — 它们在追求跨境兼并时必须面对巨大的文化、语言和法律差异 — — 这要困难得多，特别是因为它们中有许多还需要大量削减过剩产能。	For European banks – which must navigate vast differences in culture, language, and law in pursuing cross-border mergers – this has been much more difficult, especially because many of them also need to cut overcapacity drastically.
本月早些时候，IMF、世界银行和世界贸易组织发布了一份联合报告，报告称赞贸易是生产率增长、竞争和消费选择的推进器。	Earlier this month, the IMF, World Bank, and World Trade Organization published a joint report extolling the benefits of trade as a driver of productivity growth, competition, and consumer choice.
武装英美干预，特别是在没有获得联合国批准的情况下，会破坏自由及民主人士的可信性，而他们需要不惜一切代价取得信任。	Armed Anglo-American intervention, especially if it is not sanctioned by the United Nations, would do much to undermine liberals and democrats, who need all the credibility they can get.
美国真正的问题并不是被中国或其他竞争对手所超越，而是众多其他参与者（包括国家和非国家行为主体）权力资源的增加将阻碍全球治理的最新举措。	The real problem for the US is not that it will be overtaken by China or another contender, but that a rise in the power resources of many others – both states and non-state actors – will pose new obstacles to global governance.
这可以通过结束中央情报局-沙特合作推翻巴沙尔·阿萨德的行动实现，从而让阿萨德（在俄罗斯和伊朗的支持下）打败伊斯兰国、稳定叙利亚（并在相邻的伊拉克采取类似方针 ） 。	This can be accomplished by ending the CIA-Saudi alliance to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, thereby enabling Assad (with Russian and Iranian backing) to defeat the Islamic State and stabilize Syria (with a similar approach in neighboring Iraq).
利马集团（Lima Group）的12个拉美成员国，美国，加拿大，欧盟等国家和地区都应该拒绝向这类人发放签证和提供本国公司提供的服务。	The 12-member Lima Group of Latin American countries, the US, Canada, the European Union, and others, should deny visas and access to services provided by national companies.
或者它们可以有助于监督脸谱（Facebook）和谷歌等外国科技巨头进入中国市场，确保这些外国公司可以带来良性竞争及优质服务但不会完全垄断中国市场 。	Or they might help to guide the entry of foreign tech giants like Facebook and Google into the Chinese market, to ensure that those companies do not become too dominant.
比如，伊斯兰历史上曾允许某种形式的一夫多妻制，但是没有哪个自由社会会愿意把宗教的自由延伸到损害其对性别平等的承诺的范畴。	Islam, for example, has historically permitted certain forms of polygamy, but no liberal society is obliged to extend religious freedom in ways that undermine its commitment to gender equality.
上升的防务支出和布什减税政策一起，使得美国财政从布什当选时的2%GDP盈余相当于一路恶化到如今赤字和债务水平岌岌可危的程度。	Increased defense spending, together with the Bush tax cuts, is a key reason why America went from a fiscal surplus of 2% of GDP when Bush was elected to its parlous deficit and debt position today.
认为“转基因”是一种有意义的（也是危险的）的分类不但导致了对田间实验的破坏，也导致了对实验室的破坏和对研究者的人身伤害。	The assumption that “genetically engineered” or “genetically modified” is a meaningful – and dangerous – classification has led not only to vandalism of field trials, but also to destruction of laboratories and assaults on researchers.
阿富汗是一个重要的例子，巴基斯坦没能和印度解决克什米尔纠纷也是一个，这两个失败都加强了国内恐怖团体的力量。	Afghanistan is a prime example, as is the failure to settle the Kashmir imbroglio with India. Both failures have strengthened domestic terrorist groups.
任何曾经参加过竞选的人都曾听到过选民那种熟悉的疑虑 ： “ 我们只在选举的时候才能看到你们政治家 。 ”	Anyone who has ever campaigned for office has heard voters’ familiar refrain: “We only see you politicians at election time.”
除非有灾难性的事件发生 — — 例如流星撞击地球，世界大战或是瘟疫的流行 — — 人类将在接下来的很长一段时间都是影响环境的主要力量。	Unless there is a global catastrophe – a meteorite impact, a world war, or a pandemic – mankind will remain a major environmental force for many millennia.
即便随着经济的发展各方面的条件得到改善，但是随着气候变化造成越来越严重的影响，减少碳排放从长期来看还是变得越来越重要。	Even as development improves conditions, however, reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe.
截止2012年，农业增加值年增长率最高的非洲国家包括布基纳法索、埃塞俄比亚、尼日利亚、马里、莫桑比克、卢旺达和坦桑尼亚。	As of 2012, the African countries with the highest agricultural value-added in terms of annual growth included Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania.
他们将战斗、牺牲、获胜并消灭纳粹主宰欧亚大陆（哪怕继续主宰一年）的希望，让希特勒建立千年帝国的大梦毁灭。	They would fight, die, win, and thus destroy the Nazi hope of dominating Eurasia for even one more year – let alone of establishing Hitler’s 1,000-year Reich.
但旅游业的蓬勃发展并不是注定的 — — 尤其因为激进伊斯兰教的重新崛起，这将导致北非有可能在未来面对恐怖袭击。	But a flourishing tourism sector is not in the cards – not least because of the resurgence of militant Islamism, which will leave North Africa exposed to the risk of terror attacks for years to come.
这一误解被称为“货币错觉 ” ， 也就是相信，货币的名义单位是价值的最佳衡量标准，即使实际价值并不稳定。	The error is called the “money illusion ” – the belief that a nominal unit of currency is the best measure of value, even though its real value is unstable.
到那天傍晚，在威斯康辛州举行的一次集会上，特朗普就开始取笑自己“试图变得和善”的行为，并称媒体应对此次暴力行为负责。	By that evening, at a rally in Wisconsin, he was making fun of his “trying to be nice” act and blamed the media for the violence.
但越来越多的基金会 — — 如比尔和梅琳达•盖茨基金会、洛克菲勒基金会, 和 克雷斯基基金会（Kresge Foundation ） — —正在提高用于扩大慈善的投资的比例。	But a growing number of foundations – such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Kresge Foundation – are increasing the share of assets they direct toward investments that further their philanthropy.
世界银行集团2015/2016 全球监测报告（Global Monitoring Report）强调，各国的政策应对措施的不同导致人口趋势对人口福利的影响大相径庭。	As the World Bank Group’s 2015/2016 Global Monitoring Report emphasized, countries’ policy responses make all the difference in how demographic trends affect the wellbeing of the population.
与此同时，印度必须与中国、俄罗斯和美国就巴基斯坦、阿富汗和中亚国家圣战主义大爆发的问题达成战略谅解。	At the same time, India must develop a strategic understanding with China, Russia, and the US concerning the jihadist explosion in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Central Asian countries.
政策制定者经常试图去阻止变革发生，却不知阻止变革虽然可以保护现有行业和就业岗位，却也极大阻碍了投资并最终伤害了增长和就业。	Too often, policymakers want to prevent change from occurring at all. But while blocking change can protect existing industries and jobs for a while, doing so dramatically deters investment, and eventually hurts growth and employment.
从十九世纪初以来，主要的国际货币都一直都是由是处于民主政治体制下的国家发行，而在这些国家官方是不能任意行动的，债权人的权利也因此得到良好的保障。	Since the early nineteenth century, the leading international currencies have been those of countries with democratic political systems, where arbitrary official action is constrained and creditors are well represented.
让我最担心的是，十年前，这种意识形态是基地组织撼动世界所需要的唯一凭借，哪怕他们需要在阿富汗的原始山洞中完成这一“壮举 ” 。	What most worries me is that a decade ago, such an ideology was all that Al Qaeda needed to destabilize the world, even from a primitive base in the caves of Afghanistan.
在我的政府开始执政的一年中，辞职思维让位给了无限可能思维 — — 具有代表性的例子便是东京赢得2020年夏季奥运会和残奥会举办权。	In the year since my government took office, a mindset of resignation has given way to one of limitless possibility – a shift symbolized for many by Tokyo’s winning bid for the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
我们很容易把非洲大陆罕见的成功案例¾博茨瓦纳和毛里求斯¾归结为外国对其出口产品的需求（两者分别是钻石和成衣 ） ， 但其神话恐怕也仅限于此。	It is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes – Botswana and Mauritius – to foreign demand for their exports (diamonds and garments, respectively), but that story goes only so far.
此外，这一协会提案进一步激发了主要金融中心之间的串通行为：只有那些在一组有限的司法管辖区拥有债券的债券人才可以决定是否推行集体行动条款。	Moreover, the ICMA’s proposal promotes collusive behavior among the major financial centers: The only creditors whose votes would count for the activation of CACs would be those who owned bonds issued under a restricted set of jurisdictions.
可以确认的是，在以色列撤离之后加沙出现的混乱景象和巴勒斯坦权力当局在我们眼前的崩溃使得人们更为真切地感受到了沙龙退出政坛以后留下的真空。	What is certain is that the vacuum left by Sharon’s departure from politics is all the more striking in view of the images of chaos emerging from the Gaza that Israel has vacated, and the collapse of the Palestinian authority before our eyes.
同样，长期以来一直谴责“超自由主义”的英国哲学家约翰·格雷（John Grey）试图将英国脱欧投票 — — 某种明显的本土主义和仇外心理的爆发 — — 归咎于其上。	Similarly, the British philosopher John Gray, who has long decried “hyper-liberalism,” has attempted to turn the Brexit vote – a clear outburst of nativism and xenophobia – on its head.
但这些话只说对了一半，因为研究同样也证明超速驾车造成了大量伤亡，因此把限速指标下降到蜗牛那样就最好了。	But this misses half the story. We could just as well point out that since science tells us that speeding cars kill many people, we should cut speed limits to almost nothing.
但每当新的中东危机爆发时 — — 最新的例子是伊斯兰国的狂飙突进 — — 美国就会再次干预，或者是改变政府（如刚刚在伊拉克所导演的 ） ， 或者是发动新一轮轰炸袭击。	Yet whenever a new Middle East crisis erupts, the latest being triggered by the Islamic State’s recent gains, the US intervenes again, perhaps to change a government (as it has just orchestrated in Iraq) or to launch a new bombing assault.
中国特别希望通过打造绿色和高效的城市群来提高市民的受教育程度、生产力、收入水平等，以创造可持续的消费。	Specifically, China hopes to create green and efficient urban clusters populated by increasingly educated workers who can consume in a sustainable manner.
抗议者中还包括许多年轻人，他们不仅对养老金改革感到愤怒，这在很长一段时间内还不会影响到他们，普京政权在更大范围内的失败更令他们无法接受。	Protesters included many young people, who are angry not just about the pension reform, which will not affect them for a long time, but about the Putin regime’s wider failings.
2010年1月，就在华尔街又一次大发奖金之后，马萨诸塞州针对已故参议员泰德·肯尼迪（Ted Kennedy）的参议院席位举行了一次特别选举，共和党人斯科特·布朗（Scott Brown）夺得该席位。	In January 2010, Massachusetts held a special election for the late Ted Kennedy’s Senate seat, just after Wall Street paid extravagant bonuses, and elected the Republican Scott Brown.
如果没有根本性社会变革，其短期目标极难实现；而即使这些目标实现了，从中期看也未必充分，长期就更不用说了。	Not only would its short-term goals be extremely difficult to achieve without more fundamental societal changes; even if they were attained, they would probably prove inadequate in the medium term, and certainly in the long term.
再往深里看，民粹主义者掌权的时期是潜在不稳定性的表象。 这种不稳定既不利于国家进步，也无益于国际秩序。	Beyond that, populist episodes are signs of an underlying instability that neither serves national progress nor contributes to international order.
但是，这类报道辨别可能影响多年后的政治日程和公共生活的问题，并把它们曝光于天下，其影响可能十分巨大。	Yet, by identifying and bringing to the fore issues that may influence political agendas and public life for years to come, the impact of such reporting can be enormous.
而同期举行的合作政策会议则聚集了全球的学者和艺术家，共同探讨文化习俗和公共政策的关系并提出文化外交的新方向。	A companion policy conference has attracted scholars and artists from around the world exploring the relationship between cultural practice and public policy and suggesting new directions for cultural diplomacy.
确实，在许多情况下，CEO — — 通常是华尔街认可的“超级明星”空降下来“进行彻底的整合 ” — —现在就是公司，尽管其对公司的产品、客户和竞争对手知之甚少。	Indeed, in many cases, the CEO – frequently a Wall Street-endorsed “superstar” parachuted in to “shake things up” – now is the company, despite having little knowledge of its products, customers, and competitors.
新兴经济体对布雷顿森林制度的信任正在加快流失，这一问题在发达国家陷入低增长和持续经济疲软的当下特别严重。	The accelerating erosion of emerging economies’ trust in the Bretton Woods institutions is particularly problematic now, given slow growth and continued economic weakness in advanced countries.
但当轮到美国出手的时候，美国最大限度仅能减免埃及一亿美元债务，提供一亿美元贷款担保以及对私人投资的更多保险保障。	Yet when it came to US action, the most that the US could offer financially was slight debt relief for Egypt ($1 billion), scant loan guarantees ($1 billion), and some insurance coverage for private investments.
对于央行角色也没有一致意见：大约三分之一的国家，央行是主要监管者；三分之一的国家央行只负责银行；还有三分之一的国家央行只是系统监督者。	There is no consensus on the role of the central bank: in around a third of countries, it is the dominant player, in another third it has responsibilities for banks only, while in the remaining third it is a system overseer only.
到了1975年，当时毛泽东依然在世，文化大革命的怒潮也尚未平息，而阶级斗争理论则依然吃香，整个中国既没有私人汽车，商店，也没有商业广告和私有财产，但我却终于来到了北京。	But in 1975, while Mao still lived, the Cultural Revolution still raged, class politics still held sway, and there were no private cars, shops, advertisements, or private property, I arrived in Beijing.
像普里莫·列维和凯尔泰斯·伊姆雷（还有多少其他人？ ）一样，他们瘦弱的身躯背负着600万犹太人的灵魂，要把他们几乎令人难以觉察的存在写进伟大的死亡之书中。	He shares with Primo Levi and Imre Kertész – how many others? – the terrible privilege of having felt six million shadows pressing against his frail silhouette, in an effort to gain their almost imperceptible place in the great book of the dead.
莫内和舒曼指出，一个类似于美国的政治联盟能够避免导致三场欧洲大战的冲突，这一观点着实诱人，但却忽略了可怕的美国南北战争。	Monnet and Schuman argued that a political union similar to America’s would prevent the types of conflict that had caused three major European wars – an appealing idea, but one that overlooked America’s horrific Civil War.
比方说在埃及，默罕默德·穆尔西总统政府将民主制度理解为赢家通吃的方案 — — 并因此在执政一年多后被推翻。	In Egypt, for example, President Mohamed Morsi’s government treated democracy as a winner-take-all proposition – and was ousted after little more than a year.
这样做可能不会带来任何好处；他们指出，这也许可以救几条人命，但叙利亚有如此多的不同国家通过如此多的相互敌对的集团开展着代理战争，因此安全区不可能改变冲突的整体动态。	And perhaps it would do no good; it might save a few lives, they argue, but, with so many different countries fighting a proxy war via so many different groups of opposition fighters, it would not change the overall dynamic of the conflict.
尼罗河三角洲—在埃及解放广场，也就是2011年埃及骚乱的震中以北大约60英里的地方，有一所被学生们称为“监狱”的中学。	NILE DELTA – About 60 miles north of Cairo’s Tahrir Square – the epicenter of the Egyptian uprising in 2011 – there is a secondary school students call “the prison.”
直到20世纪70年代末，新上任的美联储主席保罗·沃尔克（Paul Walker）才开始收紧货币政策，使通胀下降。	It was only at the end of the 1970’s that the Fed, under its new chairman, Paul Volcker, tightened monetary policy and caused inflation to fall.
反过来，加纳医疗服务局、卫生部、国家医疗保险局（National Health Insurance Authority）和通讯部扩大了试点项目，并将远程医学纳入了卫生部的全国电子医疗战略。	In turn, the Ghana Health Service, the Ministry of Health, the National Health Insurance Authority, and the Ministry of Communications expanded the pilot program, and built telemedicine into the Ministry of Health’s national e-health strategy.
拉古娜海滩—在最近的中东之旅中，我震惊于国与国之间差距的增加 — — 夸张到什么程度呢？ 离开时，我相信如今谈论作为整体的地区团结已经毫无意义。	LAGUNA BEACH – During a recent trip to the Middle East, I was struck by the growing gap between countries – so much so that, more than ever, I came away convinced that it makes no sense today to talk of the region as a coherent whole.
在美国，共和党总统候选人唐纳德·特朗普承诺要对中国实施贸易关税、在美墨边境建造一道隔离墙，并禁止穆斯林进入美国。	In the United States, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has promised to impose trade tariffs on China, build a wall on the border with Mexico, and bar Muslims from entering the country.
结果导致拉美各地组建游击队，宗旨是推翻军事独裁政权并实现民主、自由和政策改革 — — 他们坚信无法通过和平手段实现这些目标。	As a result, throughout Latin America, guerrilla groups emerged, seeking to destabilize military dictatorships and attain democracy, freedom, and policy reform – goals that they believed could not be achieved peacefully.
在新经济对传统经济具有大规模冲击力的时代，在突破性技术进步、人口老化和气候变化等因素相互作用的环境下，这一点尤其重要。	This is all the more true at a time of large-scale disruptions, owing to rapid technological progress, demographic shifts, and climate change.
美国纳税人因此必须在未来30年内为这笔增加的债务付出每年20亿美元的真是利息，然后偿付2000亿美元本金或将债务展期。	American taxpayers would then have to pay $2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years, and then pay off or roll over the entire $200 billion.
尽管有很多关于中国将来会转向内需导向的说法，中国现在依然严重依赖出口和外部需求 — — 这是其经济增长的主要动力。	Despite all the talk about the coming shift to internal demand, China remains heavily dependent on exports and external demand as major drivers of economic growth.
如果我们能弄明白这一过程，就能治疗许多恶疾，既包括神经疾病（如帕金森病和老年痴呆症 ） ， 也包括衰退性疾病（包括癌症等与年纪相关的疾病 ） 。	If it were understood, it could lead to cures for many crippling diseases, both neurological (like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s) and degenerative (including those, like cancer, associated with aging).
由于规避风险的行为，投资者的去杠杆化以及更严格银行监管的综合影响，2年和5年期美国回购利率一直会被定期推入负值区域。	Both the two-year and five-year US repo rates have been pushed periodically into negative territory, owing to the combined effects of risk-averse behavior, investor deleveraging, and stricter banking regulation.
因此，他们的后继者，中华人民共和国主席习近平及其台湾同道马英九最近在新加坡的碰面称为历史性可谓实至名归。	So the recent meeting in Singapore between their heirs, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic and his Taiwanese counterpart, Ma Ying-jeou, could legitimately be described as historic.
每个月，我们都要确保卫生工作者完成“最后一英里 ” ， 将疫苗和其他卫生服务送到边远农村的母亲和儿童手中。	And once a month, we make sure that health workers deliver vaccines and other health services “the last mile” to mothers and children in remote rural areas.
恰恰相反，由于锁定了专利所有者的优势并推升了新技术成本，这样的保护往往会减少后续的创新数量、延缓专利扩散并提高市场集中度。	On the contrary, because they lock in incumbents’ advantages and drive up the costs of new technology, such protections are associated with less new or follow-on innovation, weaker diffusion, and increased market concentration.
这意味着除非政府支出能够搭起需求的桥梁，该经济体的大型非贸易部门就不能驱动经济增长也不会创造新的工作机会。	This means that, unless government spending provides the demand bridge, the large non-tradable part of the economy cannot drive growth and job creation.
他认为，只要你不是疯子，就不会渴望比凯恩斯得到的还要多的必需品、改善品和奢侈品，因此，经济问题是可以解决的。	And, because he imagined that no sane person could want more of the necessities, conveniences, and luxuries of life than a Keynes had, the economic problem would be solved.
因此，考察特朗普最近的税收方案十分重要，他的方案四个首要方面 — — 并且全部可以归结为为富人减税。	This is why it is important to examine Trump’s recent tax proposal, which has four salient features – all of which amount to tax cuts for the rich.
但2008年9月全球各大银行（以及保险公司和共同基金）破产和濒临破产的浪潮则表明这种看法是大错特错的。	In September 2008, the wave of failures and near-failures at global banks (and insurance companies and mutual funds) demonstrated that this view was deeply mistaken.
一个潜在竞争者或许想去进入这一市场，但考虑到大量的规则性准入壁垒，它可能最终还是决定留在原来所在的行业。	A potential competitor might consider entering that market; but, given substantial regulatory entry barriers, it might ultimately decide to remain in its current business.
在上西区由中央公园、林肯中心和哈得逊河构成的三角形区域中心，我曾经习惯于每天清晨以一种奇异的献身方式和谦卑的礼仪开始一天的生活。	Here on the Upper West Side, in the middle of a triangle formed by Central Park, Lincoln Center, and the Hudson River, I was once in the habit of beginning each day with an exotic act of devotion, a ritual of humility.
"当小孙孙问起20世纪初移民美国的俄国妇女，他们的祖先是不是和朝圣者一起坐着""五月花""号轮船到达美国时，她回答说 ： "" 不是，我们的船有个不一样的名字，但我们现在都是美国人 。 """	"""No,"" the Russian woman who came to the US in the early twentieth century replied to the grandchild who asked whether her ancestors arrived with the Pilgrims on the Mayflower. ""Our ship had a different name, but now we are all Americans."""
令一名重要的共和党人麦凯恩参议院尽管经常与布什意见相左，还表达对平民死亡的遗憾，但是补充说 ： “ 我不能告诉你我们不会再这样做了 。 ”	Senator John McCain, another leading Republican, though one often ready to disagree with Bush, expressed regret for the civilian deaths, but added, “I can’t tell you that we wouldn’t do the same thing again.”
唯一的乐观音符是有人评论达沃斯的一致预测几乎总是错误的，所以也许这次的预测可能会被证明是过于悲观了。	The only upbeat note was struck by someone who remarked that Davos consensus forecasts are almost always wrong, so perhaps this time it would prove excessively pessimistic.
与其他外科领域一样，手术过程干预肢体越少，对病人生活质量的副作用就越小，病人恢复正常活动所需的时间也越短。	As in any other surgical field, the less the procedure interferes with the body, the less likely it is to affect the patient’s quality of life adversely, and the sooner the patient will be able to return to normal activity.
2004年白俄罗斯议会选举观察团的最终报告明确指出，投票数“大大低于欧洲安全与合作组织的规定 。 ”	As the Final Report of its 2004 mission to observe the Belarusian parliamentary elections clearly stated, the vote “fell significantly short of OSCE commitments.”
确保研究和开发成为世界应对气候变化的组合应对方式的一部分将使减弱气候变化的影响的努力变得更加有效，并且能够大大增强其在下一世纪减少碳排放的能力。	Ensuring that research and development is part of the world’s climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century.
中国挑战日本对一座7个多平方公里小岛的控制权 — — 这座小岛地处中国东海，日本称之为尖阁列岛，而中国则称之为钓鱼岛。	China challenges Japanese control over more than seven square kilometers of islets – called the Senkaku Islands in Japan, and the Diaoyu Islands in China – in the East China Sea.
类似地，丝绸之路 — — 主要是指途径阿拉伯世界抵达欧洲的陆路通道 — — 让中国接触到印度的天文学、植物和草药，也接触到了佛教和伊斯兰教信仰。	Likewise, the Silk Road – primarily the overland route, which also passed through the Arab world to Europe – gave China access to Indian astronomy, plants, and herbal medicines, while introducing it to the Buddhist and Islamic faiths.
多数发展中国家已经在很大程度上实现了向对外贸易开放，放弃了过去那种最为有害的贸易政策（比如对进口采取数量限制 ） 。	Most developing nations have opened themselves significantly to foreign trade and no longer employ the most damaging policies of the past (such as quantitative restrictions on imports).
一个社会中的大部分工人都自我就业 — — 成为店主、独立专业人士或艺术家 — — 有各自的就业条件，同时能够过上体面的生活，这种社会只有在全经济生产率相当高的情况下才可行。	A society in which most workers are self-proprietors – shopkeepers, independent professionals, or artists – and set their own terms of employment while making an adequate living is feasible only when economy-wide productivity is already very high.
在多年的市场份额下跌之后，这一萎靡的表现难以解释，因为欧元区外围国的所有其他国家都录得稳健的出口增长。	This lackluster performance, which followed years of decline in market shares, is difficult to explain, given that all other countries on the eurozone periphery recorded solid export growth.
短短一年内，特朗普就从一位电视现场秀主持人兼故弄玄虚的房地产大亨，摇身一变成为全世界最强大国家的领导人，让共和党建制派颜面扫地。	In just over a year, Trump went from reality-television host and showboating property magnate to leader of the world’s most powerful country, leaving the Republican Party establishment with whiplash.
历史的经验告诉我们，市场的波动是不稳定的，波动越是剧烈，后期的翻转效应也越是明显 — — 对金融体系和经济的影响也越是明显。	History teaches that such swings are not sustainable, and that the more excessive they become, the sharper and more costly are the eventual reversals – and the graver the consequences for the financial system and the economy.
到20世纪八九十年代改革之时，将个人捆绑在文化、国家、单位和户口登记制度上的束缚在很大程度上已经不复存在。	By the time of the reforms of the 1980’s and 1990’s, bonds tying individuals to culture, the state, the work unit, and household-registration systems, for example, had largely unraveled.
但当中央银行在维持独立性所需的那种狭隘且只关注国内事务的政治授权下运作时，追求全球目标就极为困难甚至近乎不可能。	But the pursuit of global objectives is difficult, bordering on the impossible, when central banks function under the kind of narrow, domestically focused mandates that independence requires.
这样的想法要追溯至马克思 韦伯的观点。 他的观点认为有效的商业环境需要一套法律结构，这种结构应该像钟表一样准确。	Such thinking goes back at least as far as Max Weber’s argument that an effective business environment requires a legal structure as predictable as a clock.
最令我动容的是她在那时就已经预见到部落冲突的开始和伊斯兰主义者在原教旨主义纯洁性领域压倒彼此的竞争。	What strikes me the most is that she sees, even then, the beginnings of the tribal conflicts and the coming contest among Islamists to outdo one another in fundamentalist purity.
事实上，从产出、经济政策、通货膨胀和重要资产价格和金融市场的行为看，2016年将又是一个新反常态（New Abnormal）之年。	Indeed, the world economy in 2016 will continue to be characterized by a New Abnormal in terms of output, economic policies, inflation, and the behavior of key asset prices and financial markets.
但是为了支持共同的财政立场并实现货币和财政政策的更好结合，我们需要第三个组成部分：一个独立的，专注于创建风险共担机制的联邦财政机构。	But, to support a shared fiscal stance and achieve a better mix of monetary and fiscal policy, a third component is needed: an independent federal fiscal authority focused on creating risk-sharing mechanisms.
毕竟他们的历史 — — 当然包括被错误定义为“大规模现代化”的1980至2008年间 — — 都是以循环往复为主。	After all, their histories – and certainly during what was mislabeled as the “Great Moderation” between 1980 and 2008– have been predominantly cyclical.
北京—在当今世界最大的二氧化碳排放国中国，正在发生可能让有些人感到惊奇的事情 — — 随着中国寻求构建更清洁、更高效的经济，它有可能成为气候政策方面的全球领袖。	BEIJING – In what some might consider a surprising development, China – currently the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide – is emerging as a global leader in climate policy as it seeks to build a cleaner and more efficient economy.
更糟的是，美国一直阻挠其盟友印度 — — 也是巴基斯坦支持恐怖分子的主要打击目标 — — 对巴基斯坦实行任何制裁政策。	Making matters worse, the US has dissuaded its ally India – a major target of Pakistan-supported terrorists – from imposing any sanctions on the country.
通过恢复基础设施、住房和其它服务设施，并通过促进创造就业机会，使受冲突影响的人们的生活条件得以改善，来解决国内流离失所者的问题，这些事格鲁吉亚所面临的挑战。	The challenge for Georgia is to find a solution to the IDPs by rehabilitating infrastructure, housing, and other services, and by facilitating job creation so that the conflict-affected population’s living conditions can improve.
此外，随着俄罗斯政治制度变得日益高压、司法制度变得日益专断，俄罗斯富人将比现在更想在海外为财富和家庭建立安全港。	Moreover, as Russia’s political system becomes ever more oppressive, and its legal system ever more arbitrary, rich Russians will be more inclined than they already are to establish a safe base abroad for their wealth and families.
1971年，在苏联而不是不结盟运动的支持下，印度克服了巴基斯坦在孟加拉国的种族灭绝所导致的难民危机。	In 1971, it was the Soviet Union’s support, rather than that of the NAM, that helped India to overcome the refugee crisis caused by Pakistan’s genocide in Bangladesh.
就像在苏联时期一样，国家和政府官员将会被变成党的暗号，这就是梅德韦捷夫总统在普京总书记领导下所扮演的角色。	As in the Soviet era, state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers – the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin.
人们在十年前就应当明确认识到这一现实，当时由于一心一意地关注利润最大化，金融市场的系统脆弱性已经暴露无余。	That should have become obvious a decade ago, when the systemic vulnerabilities of financial markets, with their single-minded focus on profit maximization, were laid bare.
"没有美国的积极领导-即没有崇信自由贸易的政府和国会-贸易自由化就不会实现，并且会出现更多的""紧急""关税 ， "" 特别""配额和""主动""出口限制。"	"Without aggressive US leadership - which means a US executive and congress that believe in free trade - trade liberalization simply will not happen, and there will be more ""emergency"" tariffs, ""extraordinary"" quotas and ""voluntary"" export restraints."
2008年危机爆发后，意大利只拿出其他许多发达经济体的一小部分款项（相对于在国内生产总值中的占比）来救助银行。	Italy spent a fraction of what many other advanced economies marshaled (as a share of GDP) to bail out banks after the 2008 crisis.
类似地，萨尔瓦尼的德国同仁霍斯特·希霍夫（Horst Seehofer）为了保证针对试图从奥地利入境德国的寻求庇护者采取新措施，不惜在联合政府内部制造 一场危机。	Likewise, Salvini’s German counterpart, Horst Seehofer, created a crisis in the governing coalition in order to secure new measures against asylum seekers trying to enter Germany from Austria.
这就意味着欧洲复兴开发银行在未来5年内将能够每年平均投资100亿欧元来保证能够继续完成我们的目标，为东欧和私营行业提供必不可少的帮助和资金支持。	This would mean that the EBRD could invest up to €10 billion annually over the next five years, enabling us to continue to fulfill our role, providing vital backing and financial support to Eastern Europe and the private sector.
几个月后，BuzzFeed写了一篇8,500字的报道曝光前布莱巴特新闻（Breitbart News）明星评论员米罗·杨诺波罗斯（Milo Yiannopoulos ） 。	A few months later, it produced an 8,500-word expose on Milo Yiannopoulos, a former star commentator for Breitbart News.
基拉里将军将不仅仅作为一个勇士，而是一个人道主义者被世人所牢记。 作为调解人，他在1989年之后没有任何报复性举动。	Király will be remembered not merely as a warrior, but as a humanist, the conciliator who called for no reprisals after 1989, and a liberal model for many Hungarians.
例如，欧盟没能在关键时刻支持其在当地的自己人、能干的斯洛伐克外交官米罗斯拉夫·拉卡克（Miroslav Lajcak ） ， 从而严重地损害了他的威信。	It failed, for example, to back its man on the ground, the able Slovak diplomat Miroslav Lajcak, at a crucial moment, fatally undermining his authority.
与此同时，在以伊朗和真主党为代表的伊斯兰什叶派狂热分子则与致力于颠覆冷战后世界秩序、彻底改变中东的战略格局的俄罗斯政府狼狈为奸，组建了一个邪恶的联盟。	Meanwhile, an unholy alliance has formed among Shia zealots, represented by Iran and Hezbollah, and a Russian government committed to unraveling the post-Cold War order and radically changing the strategic game in the Middle East.
在某种程度上欧洲人都是基督教徒，因为人们将宗教看作么每个人自身与心目中的“神”的关系；而穆斯林则将其视为某种组织性的社会准则。	To the extent that Europeans are Christian at all, we see religion as a matter of an individual’s relationship with his or her God; Muslims see it as an organizing social principle.
有人把特朗普的胜利与西方迈向民粹主义的宏观趋势联系起来，而该现象在欧洲则尤其以英国在6月份公投脱欧为标志。	Some correlate Trump’s victory with a broader trend toward populism in the West, and, in particular, in Europe, exemplified in the United Kingdom’s vote in June to leave the European Union.
如果欧盟领导人真的关注增长和就业，他们就应该尽力修复在某些行业名存实亡的欧洲统一市场，让更多创新及高效的企业可以更快成长。	If EU leaders are committed to growth and jobs, they should work on repairing a European single market that in several sectors is “single” in name only, so that more innovative and more efficient companies can grow faster.
归根结底，爆发最严重的安全失败 — — 如日本偷袭珍珠港将美国拖入第二次世界大战，以及2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击 — — 往往都是由于准备不足。	After all, the worst security failures – for example, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which dragged the US into World War II, and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks – tend to arise from inadequate preparation.
比如，它需要制定有效的土耳其政策。 土耳其是北约成员国，在叙利亚有很大的利益 — — 并且有时候与美国存在利益冲突。	For example, it will need to devise an effective policy toward Turkey, a NATO member with strong interests in Syria – interests that, at times, conflict with America’s.
苹果公司董事长乔布斯倒签股票期权丑闻代表了创新、追查以及改革的微观生态。 现在制定规则禁止倒签，这一特定的骗术就不会重演了。	The options backdating scandal that recently caught Apple’s chairman, Steve Jobs, is a microcosm of innovation, prosecution, and reform; now that a rule has been written to prohibit backdating, this particular scam will not happen again.
还有比这种景象更典型地反应出西方世界对伊斯兰世界的社会习俗的不自在吗？ 或是，从相反角度来看，是伊斯兰世界对西方世界习俗的不自在？	Could this image be any more iconic of the discomfort the West has with the social mores of Islam, and vice versa?
银行家希望去年的债券得到偿付（产生捍卫稳定的激励 ） ， 但又希望今年获得高薪（产生利润最大化的激励，而利润最大化常常包含着冒险 ） 。	The banker wants last year’s bonds to be paid (creating an incentive to safeguard stability) but wants a high payment this year (creating an incentive to maximize profit, which usually entails risk-taking).
如果你是购买理应有效果的产品的顾客，你会想要第九名（共十名）的计划；如果你是自认为能增加价值的风险资本家，你会想要第八名（共二十名 ） 。	If you are a customer buying a product that should work, you want the nine out of ten; if you are a venture capitalist who thinks she can add value, you want the eight out of 20.
当然，由于日本人口在快速老化，儿童数量在下降，投资者将会提出一个显而易见的问题：日本到哪里去寻找它所需要的创新型、富于创造力的人力资源？	Of course, given that Japan’s population is rapidly aging, and the number of children is falling, investors find themselves asking an obvious question: “Where will Japan find the innovative and creative human resources that it needs?”
商业银行由于获得了央行的资金而兴奋不已，把钱借给了大量并不靠谱的投资项目，而金融创新的大爆发（特别是衍生工具）更是助长了这一借贷疯狂。	Commercial banks, flush with central banks’ money, advanced credit for many unsound investment projects, with the explosion of financial innovation (particularly of derivative instruments) fueling the lending frenzy.
非正统量化宽松 （ “ 货币化二号 ” ） 能避免这一问题，因为央行的借款不需要偿付；央行资产冲抵政府负债。	Unorthodox QE (“monetization two”) avoids this problem, because the central bank’s borrowing will not be repaid; central-bank assets net out against government liabilities.
尽管最初的GDP大幅下降发生在2008年四季度和2009年一季度，但许多西方经济体至今仍没能很好地恢复，更不用说维持能全面恢复失去的就业岗位和收入的增长率了。	Notwithstanding the initial sharp drop in GDP in the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, too many Western economies have yet to rebound properly, let alone sustain growth rates that would make up fully for lost jobs and income.
基础经济学课程都有提到“向后弯曲的储蓄供给曲线”这一奇特现象：在一定的环境中，降低利率导致储蓄增加。	Basic economics courses cover the curious case of the “backward-bending supply curve of savings”: In some circumstances, lower interest rates can lead to higher savings.
但是，除了深度衰退情形，凯恩斯主义所宣称的推迟减支是避免伤害经济的必要手段的观点充其量只能说有待商榷，并且会导致唯一控制支出的时机只有长期繁荣这一推论。	But, other than in deep recessions, the validity of the Keynesian claim that delaying spending cuts is necessary to avoid undermining the economy is at best unclear, and would leave a long boom as the only time to control spending.
去年，中央政府将更多的教育和医疗支出分给了地区政府，但又没有配置更多资源 — — 也没有人能为此做些什么。	Last year, the central government delegated more education and health-care expenditures to regional bodies, without allocating more resources – and there was nothing anyone could do about it.
如果一家英国公司将程序工作外包给班加罗尔，则称为“贸易 ” ， 如果印度程序员在伯明翰做同样的工作，则称为“移民 ” — —但交易是类似的。	It is called “trade” if a British company outsources computing work to Bangalore, and “migration” if Indian programmers do the same work in Birmingham – yet the transactions are analogous.
美国共和党候选人已开始利用最近的巴黎大谋杀指责总统奥巴马 — — 并将指责对象扩大到所有未来民主党候选人 — — 表现软弱。	Republican candidates in the US are already using the recent murder spree in Paris to blame President Barack Obama, and by extension any future Democratic candidate, for being weak.
同一张报纸援引特朗普的崛起证明，在美国制度中，政治领导人在解决种族对峙等“复杂社会冲突”和其他群众不满根源方面很“无助 ” 。	The same paper used Trump’s rise to show that, in the American system, political leaders are “helpless” to address “complex social conflicts” like racial tensions and other sources of popular discontent.
根据这份报告的建议，巴拉克·奥巴马总统日前颁布了一项行政命令，呼吁所有美国政府机构利用手中的权力来促进竞争。	Acting on its recommendations, President Barack Obama recently issued an executive order calling on all US government agencies to use their authority to promote competition.
那么，如果消费者们花12美元一磅购买他们知道由现在可以供得起他们的孩子们上学的农民们采用无毒化学品、在让鸟类存活的绿茵树下种植的咖啡时，经济学家们为什么要提出批评呢？	So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children?
该委员会提交的报告（目前仅限于德语版）开始时采用了禁止关系当事者、特别是那些成年后才知道对方是自己同父异母兄弟姊妹的当事者的证词。	Its report (currently available only in German) begins with testimony from those in a forbidden relationship, particularly half-brothers and sisters who came to know each other only as adults.
电子空间将会和超短起飞和降落新技术一道，让安全、安静、可以承受并且是就在你家房子面前的马路的个人空中交通工具摆在面前。	Together with new technologies enabling Super-Short Takeoff and Landing (superSTOL) a digital airspace would put safe, quiet, affordable, street-in-front-of-your-house personal air vehicles within sight.
当前主流的“有效市场管理论”只是说市场反映了公众所知的信息，也难以持续地从市场中赚钱 — — 我们从某些投资者在危机中遭重创的投资组合中可以发现这点。	The dominant “efficient markets theory” says only that markets reflect what is publicly known, and that it is hard to make money off markets consistently – something verified by the hit that most investor portfolios took in the crisis.
而投资不足也不是因为利润 — — 不管是税前还是税后；税后公司利润占GDP之比在过去30年中几乎翻了两倍。	And the lack of investment is not because profits, either before or after tax, are too low; after-tax corporate profits as a share of GDP have almost tripled in the last 30 years.
对市场的道义批评主要集中在它倾向于让道义上有欠缺的品质类型受益、给予令人不快的动机以特权以及促成不受欢迎的结果。	Moral criticisms of the market focus on its tendency to favor a morally deficient character type, to privilege disagreeable motives, and to promote undesirable outcomes.
汉堡的海港新城有限公司和城市港口开发公司重新开发的哥本哈根部分地区不过是城市地区利用这种发展机制的两个世纪的例子。	Hamburg’s HafenCity GmbH, and parts of Copenhagen that were revitalized by the City & Port Development Company, are just two examples of urban areas that have used this type of development mechanism.
该国高速的经济增长，战略潜力，庞大的国内市场以及对基础设施，教育和科研的巨额投资，还有大规模军备建设都证明了这一判断。	The country’s rapid economic growth, strategic potential, huge internal market, and enormous investment in infrastructure, education, and research and development, as well as its massive military buildup, will see to that.
我们将我们在其中工作的组织视同于一个有权利、义务、价值、声誉和脾气的人，其管理者认为自己代表这个“人”行动。	We think of the organization in which we work as if it was a person with rights, obligations, values, reputation, and temperament, on whose behalf managers regard themselves as acting.
以习近平命名的政治意识形态，是不同于自由民主派的另外一种选择，现在既然得以确立，成为中共思想体系的一部分，那么挑战习近平就无异于挑战共产党的信仰体系。	Now that Xi’s eponymous political ideology, which proposes an alternative to liberal democracy, is part of the school of thought around which the CPC coalesces, challenging Xi is tantamount to challenging the Party’s very belief system.
来自RNA的“翻译”从22种必需氨基酸中制造出了三维蛋白质 — — 之所以必需是因为我们的身体无法制造它们，而必须从我们的饮食中摄取。	Translation from RNA creates three-dimensional proteins from combinations of 22 essential amino acids – essential only because our bodies are not able to make them, so they must be obtained from our diet instead.
初始条件很重要，在这方面，美国的政策框架似乎确保了美国经济拥有相对较高的恢复力，不仅在面临全球危机时如此，在面临国内政策动荡时亦然。	Initial conditions matter, and in this respect America’s policy framework seems to have ensured the US economy’s relatively higher resilience not only to the global crisis, but also to domestic political volatility.
负责内部市场和服务的欧盟委员巴尼耶（Michel Barnier）提出的方案十分大胆，但欧洲确实需要强大、有效的解决机制确保及时采取行动，解决银行危机。	The proposal presented by Michel Barnier, European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, is bold, but Europe does indeed need a strong, efficient resolution mechanism that ensures timely action to address banking crises.
但是，对于承受着中国关于领土和领海纠纷的坚决主张压力的国家来说，美国的强调经济参与激发了对其承诺的新疑虑。	But, for the countries bearing the brunt of China’s recalcitrant approach to territorial and maritime disputes, this emphasis raises new doubts about America’s commitment.
但是，由于自由、稳定、繁荣的乌克兰十分符合欧洲的战略利益，因此欧盟成员国政府也应该分担金融改革的负担。	But, given that a free, stable, and prosperous Ukraine is very much in Europe’s strategic interest, the EU’s member governments should also share the burden of financing reform.
发自纽约 — — 在先后被白宫和布雷巴特新闻网（Breitbart News）扫地出门后，人称特朗普总统大选总教头的斯蒂芬·K·班农（Stephen K. Bannon）发誓要重塑欧洲。	NEW YORK – After being cast out of the White House and Breitbart News, Stephen K. Bannon, often referred to as the mastermind of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, has vowed to remake Europe.
特许费制药公司专注于有可能一炮而红的已批准药物，实现了稳定的收入流和令人印象深刻的股东回报 — — 即使在股市波动最剧烈的时期。	Royalty Pharma focused on approved drugs with blockbuster potential, creating stable revenue streams and impressive equity returns – even during periods of extreme stock-market volatility.
关键在于取消诽谤案的刑事性质，从而使它们不会带来牢狱之灾；将它们只作为民事案件起诉，对被判诽谤行为成立者课以适当的罚款。	The key will be to remove the criminal element from defamation cases, and thus the prospect of imprisonment, and instead prosecute them as civil cases, with those found guilty of defamation being subject to reasonable fines.
但是世界其他国家能容纳日本大胆的经济政策实验么，还是会采取自保手段从而阻碍这个重要政策传导机制的运行？	But will the rest of the world accommodate Japan’s bold policy experiment, or will it take protective steps and thus impede the operation of a crucial policy transmission mechanism?
去年7月，NTC军队领导人阿尔-欧贝迪（Abdul Fatah Younis al-Obeidi）在一团迷雾中遇刺。	Last July, the Council’s military leader, Abdul Fatah Younis al-Obeidi, was assassinated under ambiguous circumstances.
事件发生时它依然保持冷静，并会不惜任何代价来避免做出那些可能会被视为鼓励过度冒险或是制造一小轮通胀的举措。	It remains calm in the face of events, seeking at all cost to avoid doing anything that might be construed as encouraging excessive risk-taking or creating even a whiff of inflation.
中国固定资产投资占GDP的比重正在接近前无古人的50 % ， 因此西方分析师担心新的投资导向的财政刺激只能让中国加速迈向崩溃的宿命。	With fixed investment nearing the unprecedented threshold of 50% of GDP, they fear that another investment-led fiscal stimulus will only hasten the inevitable China-collapse scenario.
只有集合众人的力量，我们才能建立一个支持气候领导力的民意风潮并营造出一个正确的发展势头，确保能快速过渡到一个可持续且公平的世界。	Only by coming together can we build a groundswell of support for climate leadership and create the right momentum to secure a fast transition to a sustainable and equitable world.
几乎所有主要标志，包括资产和住房价格攀升、贸易平衡赤字、政府和居民负债猛增以及危机以前的增长轨迹等等都给美国亮出了红灯。	Across virtually all the major indicators – including equity and housing price runs-ups, trade balance deficits, surges in government and household indebtedness, and pre-crisis growth trajectories – red lights are blinking for the US.
比如，租车服务商Uber不但改变了人们的出行方式；也在引领一场零售业革命，商品和服务可以“Uber化 ” — —客户花钱使用而不拥有它们。	"The car-sharing service Uber, for example, has not only changed how people get around; it also appears to be leading a retail revolution in which goods and services are “Uberized"" – customers pay to use them, not own them."
这些女性可能有一天会追随舒雅德·阿德拉希姆（Souad Abderrahim）的脚步 — — 她在伊斯兰复兴运动党的支持下成功当选首都突尼斯市首位女市长。	Some may one day follow in the footsteps of Souad Abderrahim, who was elected the first woman mayor of Tunis with the support of the Islamist Ennahda Movement.
但是目前也出现了投资增长快于储蓄增长的势头，美国经常账户赤字 — — 从2006年占GDP的6%下降到去年的2.5 % — —有再次扩大的危险。	But, as investment now rises relative to saving, there is a danger that the US current-account deficit, which fell from 6% of GDP in 2006 to barely 2.5% of GDP last year, will widen again.
有太多实际或潜在的“民族”可以形成世界国家体系的基础。 更重要的是，它们中的许多经过了数世纪以来的相互纠葛，早已是剪不断，理还乱。	There are simply too many “nations,” actual or potential, to form the basis of a world system of states, not least because so many of them, having been jumbled up for centuries, cannot now be disentangled.
在许多发展中国家，税收总收入有三个主要来源：对商品和服务收取的国内税（销售税和消费税 ） 、 直接税（主要对公司收取）以及最重要的对外贸易税（进口关税 ） 。	In many developing countries, total tax revenue is derived from three main sources: domestic taxes on goods and services (sales and excise taxes), direct taxes (primarily on corporations), and, most important, taxes on foreign trade (import duties).
特别是，动画、艺术、设计和软件等创新性产业 — — 大多以个人能力和天赋为基础 — — 相对更能适应冲突。	In particular, creative industries, such as animation, arts, design, and software – which are mostly based on individual skills and talent – tend to be more resilient to conflict than others.
当法国成为纳粹的傀儡政府的时候，他们都加入了抵抗组织，当法国重新获得阿尔及利亚的主权之后，他们两人又同时为其独立呐喊。	Both joined the Resistance when France was a Nazi puppet state, and both called for Algerian independence after France regained its sovereignty.
陈水扁发动的这场运动是如此坚持不懈，甚至令某些人回想起了当年毛泽东发动的文化大革命，那时整个中国都被分裂成“敌 ” “ 我”两派。	So insistent was Chen’s campaign that it reminded some people of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a time when Chinese were divided into “us” and “them.”
此外，由于水短缺是行业所面临的最艰巨的挑战之一，因此生态友好型（eco-friendly）方案要比常规方案具备更强的可行性。	And, because water scarcity is among the top challenges facing the industry, eco-friendly solutions are often more viable than conventional ones.
即将召开的罗马第二届国际营养会议将通过改善政策及增进国际团结为所有人提供制定政治目标加强营养的历史性机遇。	The upcoming Second International Conference on Nutrition in Rome will provide a historic opportunity to galvanize political commitment to enhance nutrition for all through better policies and international solidarity.
美国的反应让中国深感不安，特别是美国所谓的“重返亚洲”或“战略再平衡 ” ， 其潜台词都是遏制中国。	The US response has put China on edge, particularly America’s so-called “Asian pivot,” or “strategic rebalancing,” with its subtext of containing China.
在许多国家，一方面是30~45%的适龄劳动人口失业，闲赋在家，或只能找到兼职工作，另一方面却是企业抱怨在技术到卫生医疗等各个岗位招不到人。	In many countries, 30-45% of the working-age population is unemployed, inactive, or working only part-time. Meanwhile, companies are complaining that they cannot fill open positions in sectors ranging from technology to health care.
（至少在第一个任期内）也没有一位女性特别关注与妇女有关的议程，而研究证实农村妇女的地位在她们治下也缺乏改善。	None was particularly focused on a women’s agenda (at least not in their first terms in office), and studies show that rural women did not fare particularly well under their rule.
今天，中国已成为位居世界第二的经济体，拥有蓬勃发展的制造业和迅速壮大的富裕中产阶级。 当今中国15亿人口中有超过半数居住在城市。	Today, it boasts the world’s second-largest economy, a thriving manufacturing sector, and a rapidly growing, prosperous middle class, while more than half of China’s 1.5 billion citizens now live in cities.
马克龙劳工市场改革背后的逻辑推动了30年来从国际货币基金组织到经合组织的政策经济学家和国际机构的结构改革议程。	The logic behind Macron’s labor-market reforms has driven the structural-reform agenda of policy economists and international institutions ranging from the International Monetary Fund to the OECD during the last three decades.
土耳其、埃及和突尼斯是非常不同的国家，但有一点是相同的，他们都有伊斯兰政府（至少在埃及最新事件之前是如此 ） 。	Turkey, Egypt, and Tunisia are very different countries, but one thing that they share are Islamist governments (at least until recently in Egypt’s case).
自从11月4日以来，美国在欧洲的形象已经大变，而一旦奥巴马接任总统，他的外交风格可能还会巩固这种变化。	America’s image in Europe has changed profoundly since November 4, and the style of Obama’s diplomacy once he becomes president will probably confirm that change.
在最近的保守党年度大会上，首相梅及其内阁成员的讲话表明他们准备追求“硬退欧 ” ， 取缔给英国经济带来巨大好处的贸易安排。	At the recent Conservative Party annual conference, speeches by Prime Minister Theresa May and members of her cabinet revealed an intention to pursue a “hard Brexit,” thereby dismantling trading arrangements that have served the economy well.
安曼 — — 今年3月22日的世界水日有机会凸显出许多国家所面临的严峻现实：淡水供应已日益成为地区和全球事务中一种决定性的战略因素。	AMMAN – This year’s World Water Day, on March 22, provides an opportunity to highlight what in many countries has become a grim reality: The availability of fresh water is increasingly a defining strategic factor in regional and global affairs.
但穆巴拉克却拒绝了这一要求，还声称如果美国国务卿乔治·舒尔茨认为埃及会背叛巴勒斯坦斗争事业的话就一定是“疯了 ” 。	But Mubarak refused, saying that Secretary of State George Shultz was “crazy” if he believed that Egypt would betray the Palestinian cause.
最近，两位JBS高管 — — 乔斯利和韦斯利·巴蒂斯塔（Joesley and Wesley Batista）兄弟因腐败问题被捕，揭开了行业腐败的面纱。	The recent corruption-related arrests of two JBS executives, the brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, pulled back the curtain on corruption in the industry.
这些益处还累积于相对贫困的工人们，这些工人们缺乏讨价还价的力量来使得老板们提供他们所的确想要、而且需要的养老金。	They also accrue to relatively poor workers who lack the bargaining power to induce bosses to offer the pensions they really want – and need.
如今，中国故技重施，入侵范围包括中国、印度和巴基斯坦三国的边界点 — — 即去年解放军深入其中并导致三周军事对峙的地方。	Now, China is at it again, including near the convergence point of China, India, and Pakistan – the same place last year’s PLA encroachment triggered a three-week military standoff.
为了避免这种结果，只要中国的GDP增长超过经合组织成员国，我们的名义利率也应该相应提高，汇率应该更具弹性，而且必须承受更高的结构性通胀或人民币升值。	To avoid this outcome, as long as China’s GDP growth exceeds that of OECD economies, its nominal interest rates must also be higher, its exchange rate must be more flexible, and it must tolerate higher structural inflation.
70%的印度受访者 — — 相比之下，澳大利亚受访者的这一比例只有21 % — —同意以下说法 ： “ 母亲出去赚钱，孩子就会受罪 。 ”	And 70% of Indian respondents – compared to just 21% of Australian respondents – agreed with the statement: “When a mother works for pay, the children suffer.”
但在试图证明俄罗斯可以克服美国可能采取的任何新的战略防御措施时，普京暴露出他对俄罗斯战略核武库可能会丧失意义的担忧。	But in his attempt to prove that Russia can overcome any new strategic defense measures the US might put in place, Putin betrayed his fear that Russia’s strategic nuclear arsenal could be rendered irrelevant.
除了显而易见的好处，这些收益的重要性还体现在，如联合国儿童基金会最近所指出，一国针对脆弱儿童的社会服务投资的潜在回报，在福利抵达最脆弱群体的情况下，能够提高两倍。	Aside from the obvious benefits, these gains matter because, as UNICEF recently noteda country’s potential return on investment in social services for vulnerable children is two times greater when the benefits reach the most vulnerable.
尽管如此，欧洲央行是正确的：它在不同成员国面临截然不同的货币条件；事实上，欧元区就像是拙劣的固定汇率系统，存在固定汇率系统的所有风险。	Nonetheless, the ECB is right that it is faced with very different monetary conditions in different member states; indeed, the eurozone is akin to a badly working fixed-exchange-rate system, with all of the attendant risks.
也许必须对智力给予一些关注，然而忽略起码是同样重要的认知能力—这一趋势却不合理：正是这种能力支撑起理性的思维和行为。	Perhaps some of this attention to intelligence is necessary, but what is not warranted is the tendency to ignore cognitive capacities that are at least equally important: the capacities that sustain rational thought and action.
在这个世界上已经充斥着太多在缓解区域性贫困方面缺乏成效的发展援助计划，而中国在世界各地逐渐明朗的身影则提供了丰富的机会去重构全球经济援助和资助项目的大局。	In a world weary of the limited effectiveness of most development programs in curtailing endemic poverty, China’s growing role in countries around the world provides ample opportunity to reconstruct the landscape of economic aid and financing.

我们是否有政治意愿实施有效控制则是 — — 永远都是这样 — — 另一个问题，很大程度上，这是因为大银行很有权力，并且它们希望影子永不变。	Whether we have the political will to implement effective controls is, as always, another question – in large part because the big banks are very powerful and they would like the shadows to remain as shadowy as they are now.
特别是，EFA可以成立一个债务削减基金（Debt Reduction Fund ） — —由默克尔经济顾问委员会提出并得到德国社会民主党和绿党支持的欧洲偿债协议（European Debt Redemption Pact）改进版。	In particular, the EFA could establish a Debt Reduction Fund – a modified form of the European Debt Redemption Pact that was proposed by Merkel’s Council of Economic Advisers and endorsed by Germany’s Social Democrats and Greens.
他们相信政府干预本身会因为官僚的无能和寻租理论带来代价惨重的失败，私有利益通过这些因素试图使政策向有利于自身利益的方向发展。	They believe that government intervention tends to generate its own costly failures because of bureaucratic incompetence and rent-seeking, whereby private interests try to steer policy to their own advantage.
至于政府债务和不可持续的财政赤字方面，那些警告必须迅速实施紧缩政策否则危机不可避免的算命先生们可能要失望了。	As for government debt and unsustainable fiscal deficits, doom-mongers who warn of an inevitable crisis if belt tightening is not soon imposed are likely to be disappointed.
这并不是说中国令人印象深刻的增长记录不重要 — — 以10%左右的速度连续增长三十年，这绝对是一个历史奇迹。	This in no way detracts from the country’s impressive growth record, which, at about 10% per year for three decades, constitutes a historical miracle.
宗教 — — 其对许多人身份认同的影响力不亚于肤色 — — 应该被归为意识形态还是更加接近于民族仍有待争议。	Whether religion, which for many people establishes their identity as much as the color of their skin, should be classified as ideological, or as something closer to ethnicity, is debatable.
在中国发展高层论坛上，他强调了当前局面与1972年他与时任总统尼克松首次与毛泽东和周恩来会面时的不同。	At the CDF, he stressed how different the situation is now, compared to 1972, when he and then-President Richard Nixon first met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.
如果伊朗拒绝这个提议或没有忠于自己的承诺，这将使它国际社会中彻底孤立，并且为采取进一步措施提供了有力的依据。	Were Iran to refuse the offer or fail to honor its obligations, it would totally isolate itself internationally and provide emphatic legitimization to further measures.
恰恰由于已经有如此多的情绪被投入到了量化宽松政策之上，因此回复常态所带来的心理冲击可能是极为危险且出乎意料的。	Precisely because so much emotion has been invested in QE, the psychological effects of returning to normalcy are going to be perilous and unpredictable.
加州海岸委员会（California Coastal Commission）甚至在考虑大规模“有管理的撤退 ” ， 让居民远离海岸。	And the California Coastal Commission is even considering a massive “managed retreat” plan to move residents away from the shoreline.
在此之后，最终支撑今天欧盟一体化的构架往往更加注重经济，并任由北约和美国安全保护伞来负责欧洲的领土防御。	After that, the structures of integration that would eventually underpin today’s EU tended to be more economically oriented, and territorial defense was left to NATO and the US security umbrella.
作为总统，他受到了来自改革派的批评，指责他未能抵抗暗中破坏经济改革的多个强力集团，也没能改善伊朗和西方世界的关系。	As president, he faced criticism from reformists for his failure to resist a range of powerful groups that sabotaged economic reform and improvement in Iran’s relations with the west.
目前看来，盖特纳的“压力测试”似乎成功了，因为事实上，股票市场不只是稳定下来而已，像花旗集团和美国银行这样的银行股票的价格，还从最低点上涨了四倍。	So far, Geithner seems to have succeeded in his “tests,” as the stock market has indeed more than stabilized, with prices of bank shares such as Citigroup and Bank of America quadrupling from their lows.

相比之下，要记住前总统比尔·克林顿从未向参议院提交过《京都议定书 》 ， 尤其在95名参议员已经签署了反对此议定书的“参议院意见”决议之后。	For perspective, it is worth remembering that former US President Bill Clinton never submitted the Kyoto Protocol to the Senate, not least because 95 senators had signed on to a “sense of the Senate” resolution against it.
不过正如共和党人指出的那样，西欧国家的生活水平平均低于美国30 % ； 欧洲也面临着经济增长放缓，高失业率和不断紧绷的社会压力。	But, as Republicans point out, Western Europe’s standard of living is 30% lower than that of the US, on average; Europe also faces slower growth, higher unemployment, and heightening social tensions.

事实上，只要以色列和美国不承认，即使巴勒斯坦获得国家地位也无济于事，而墨西哥和智利将因为与美以联盟在对其具有重大意义的问题上保持距离而失去很多东西。	Indeed, little would change on the ground even with full Palestinian statehood if Israel and the US do not accept it – and Mexico and Chile could lose much in distancing themselves from an ally on a question of great importance to it.
比如说在2010年，随着中国在针对其邻国的外交政策上转趋强硬，它和印度，日本和韩国的关系都遭到了削弱。	In 2010, for example, as China became more assertive in its foreign policy toward its neighbors, its relations with India, Japan, and South Korea suffered.
中国理应对美国表现出感激和遵从，因为美国让它获得了从150年来的西方帝国主义列强和日本的蹂躏下崛起赶超的权利。	China was supposed to show gratitude and deference to the US for the right to catch up from 150 years of abuse by Western imperial powers and Japan.
结果，伊朗出现了自暴力镇压2009年绿色运动（Green Movement）以来首次严重的反对现有政权的公共不满。	The result is the first signs of serious public discontent with the regime since the violent repression of the Green Movement in 2009.
2017年4月2日，特朗普还给中国贴上货币操纵“世界冠军”的标签，但一周后他就不得不自扇耳光，告诉《华尔街日报 》 “ 他们不是货币操纵国 ” 。	As late as April 2, 2017, Trump labeled the Chinese the “world champions” of currency manipulation, only to reverse his position a week later, telling The Wall Street Journal, “They’re not currency manipulators.”
事实上，教育的回报率一直在下降，部分原因在于高技能工人的供给速度快于需求，而这又是因为非正式企业不需要高技能工人。	In fact, returns to education have been falling partly because the supply of skilled workers has outpaced demand, as most informal firms do not require them.
IMF一开始预计希腊真实（经通胀调整的）GDP将在2010—2011年间收缩5%左右，在2012年稳定下来，并在此后开始增长。	The IMF initially projected that Greece’s real (inflation-adjusted) GDP would contract by around 5% over the 2010-2011 period, stabilize in 2012, and grow thereafter.
资本流 — — 用股票和债券购买量、外国直接投资和贷款衡量 — — 在2007年至2015年间下降了三分之二，从11.9万亿美元减少到3.3万亿美元。	Capital flows – in the form of equity and bond purchases, foreign direct investment, and lending – fell by over two thirds, from $11.9 trillion to $3.3 trillion, between 2007 and 2015.
科学家们运用两种方法进行研究：一是提取出具有特定健康问题的人的特定基因DNA序列，将其与其他人群进行对比并找出两者的差异之处。	Scientists are taking two approaches. In one, they sequence the DNA of particular genes in many individuals with or without some determined health condition and look for differences between the two groups.
但印度社会的偏见太深，许多转信锡克教的人发现，他们的高种姓的新教友们主宰着这一信仰的正式宗教机构，他们获得的对待并不比在印度教中强。	But so deep is the prejudice in Indian society that many converted Sikhs found that their new co-religionists of higher castes, who dominate the faith’s official religious bodies, treated them no better than Hindus had.
但是到2013年，这一比例一举飙升至26 % ， 而且即使按照对新兴市场增长最为悲观的假设，我们预计该比例将在2025年达到39 % ， 更乐观的估计甚至可能达到50%的份额。	By 2013, this share had soared to 26%, and, even on the most pessimistic assumptions for emerging-market growth, we expect it to rise to 39% by 2025 and to as high as 50% on more bullish assumptions.
一家荷兰或马来西亚法院，甚或是联合国授权的一家特别法院（比如1988年起诉泛美洛克比空难的法院）将决定在法律层面谁来为击落MH17航班负责。	A Dutch or Malaysian court, or even a special tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations (like the one that prosecuted the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie bombing), will ultimately determine who bears legal responsibility for the downing of MH17.
但很多时候，本可以为难民提供帮助的发展组织面临经费不足和规定僵化的困扰，导致难民的需求无法得到满足。	And yet, too often, development organizations that could provide refugees with a hand up face insufficient funding and stiff regulations that prevent them from addressing refugees’ needs.
近年来，对房地产行业管制从严及从紧的货币政策已经导致固定资产投资增长率从2008年以前的年均超过25%下降到今天的20%左右。	In recent years, tight monetary policy and increasingly strict controls on the real-estate sector have caused the growth rate of fixed-asset investment to fall, from more than 25% annually before 2008 to around 20% today.
佛罗伦萨 — — 美国总统奥巴马最近出台的银行业“大修”草案，其核心思想来自美联储前主席保罗·沃尔克。	FLORENCE – Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker provided the central inspiration for President Barack Obama’s proposal for overhauling banking.
在调查期间，摩托车乘客占该院1，500起创伤病例的41 % ， 而骑车者的伤害占该院手术预算的62.5 % 。	During the survey period, motorcycle passengers accounted for 41% of the hospital’s 1,500 trauma cases, and riders’ injuries consumed 62.5% of the hospital’s surgery budget.
但是，奥巴马确实承诺要改变政策，指出在任何袭击发动前，他都要求“几乎确定不会有平民被杀或受伤 — — 这是我们所能设立的最高标准 。 ”	Obama did, however, promise a change of policy, indicating that before any strike was undertaken, he would require “near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured – the highest standard we can set.”
宪政爱国主义是由两位德国哲学家斯滕贝尔格和雅士培提出的理念。 其目的是在德国代替由于纳粹历史而彻底失信的民族主义。	Constitutional patriotism, a concept developed by two German philosophers, Dolf Sternberger and Karl Jaspers, was intended to replace the nationalism that had been discredited in Germany by the country’s Nazi past.
进一步的模拟表明，专注于某些药物类型 — — 如“孤儿病”药物 — — 的激进可能只需要2.5—5亿美元规模、包含较少的 药物就可以实现两位数的回报率。	Further simulations suggest that funds specializing in some drug classes, such as therapies for orphan diseases, could achieve double-digit rates of return with just $250-500 million dollars and fewer compounds in the portfolio.
伊拉克的民兵组织不会安稳地离开,然而它们的解散对于长期稳定是至关重要的,它本身对于该地区的稳定就是必不可少的条件。	Iraq’s militias will not go quietly, yet their dissolution is essential for long-term stability, itself a sine qua non for stability in the region.
可惜到了2015年，鉴于欧元区成员国长期积累的公共债务和银行亏损，这种方案会导致外围国家陷入更深的经济衰退，几乎肯定会导致货币联盟的解体。	Alas, in 2015, given the eurozone members’ legacy public debts and banking losses, such a scheme would cause a deeper recession in the periphery and almost certainly lead to the monetary union’s breakup.
首先，尽管有些国家可以采取财政刺激手段，但是许多国家中这一手段是有限的。 因此，该地区作为整体必需保护其来之不易的较低的公共债务。	· First, while there may be scope for fiscal stimulus in some countries, in many countries it is limited; hence, the region as a whole must protect its hard-won low level of public debt.
第二种观点是，近几十年来，金融部门一直在努力游说去监管化，花了大量的时间和金钱说服政客这才是安全而现代化的银行业方式。	The second view is that the financial sector lobbied long and hard for deregulation in recent decades, and spent a great deal of time and money persuading politicians that it constituted the safe and modern approach to banking.
标准普尔公司（Standard & Poor’s）认为，一年后，这些企业的总债务将达到14.2万亿美元，超过美国未偿还债务规模（13.1万亿美元 ） ， 使中国成为世界上第一大企业债发行国。	Standard & Poor’s found that, a year later, these firms’ total debt amounted to $14.2 trillion, eclipsing the $13.1 trillion of outstanding debt in the United States and making China the world’s largest issuer of corporate debt.
首先，关于责任分担的辩论不应该仅仅局限于现在在阿富汗的军队级别，因为，不管这些军队级别如何重要，它们只是说明了部分的事实。	First of all, the debate about burden-sharing should not be reduced solely to today’s force levels in Afghanistan, because, however important these force levels are, they tell only part of the story.
特别是习近平关于在历史发展方面存在可以辨认且永恒不变的“法则 ” — —而且既可指定又可预测 — — 的观点在上月的外事会议上显得尤为突出。	In particular, Xi’s view that that there are identifiable immutable “laws” of historical development, both prescriptive and predictive, was particularly prominent at last month’s foreign policy conference.
这种说法乍听上去不失公正，而且在一段很短的时间内，它的确获得了不完全了解情况的执政者和投资者的认同。	The message sounded fair and it did, for a short time, appeal to some policymakers and investors not fully apprised of the situation.
一些伊朗改革派和流亡人士则以一种积极的态度看待艾哈迈迪内贾德的当选。 他们认为这一届政府更可能会表现出现政权的真正立场并破除西方任何认为伊朗会妥协的奢望。	Some Iranian reformers and exiles put a bright face on Ahmadinejad’s election, arguing that his administration is more likely to show the regime’s real face and disabuse any Western hopes of compromise.
由于过去几个月民众情绪发生了很大转变，许多民主党人现在相信他们将赢得席位，甚至可能重新夺回众议院的控制权。	Owing to a major shift in public sentiment in the past few months, many Democrats are now convinced that they will win seats, and potentially reclaim control of the House of Representatives.
如果说卡梅伦的顾问们高估了他们可以从默克尔和其他人那里获得的支持，那么他们显然低估了欧洲议会的权力和效率。	If Cameron’s advisers overestimated the support that they might have received from Merkel and others, they clearly underestimated the power and effectiveness of the European Parliament.
印度近两年增长强劲（2010年11.2 % ， 2011年7.7 % ） ，但2012年放缓至4 % 。	India had a couple of years of strong growth recently (11.2% in 2010 and 7.7% in 2011) but slowed to 4% in 2012.
• 各国需深化金融体系，引导国内和该地区的大量储蓄为发展需求融资；例如，消除该地区的基础设施缺口仍然至关重要。	· Countries need to deepen their financial systems to channel the large pool of domestic and regional savings toward financing their development needs; closing the region’s infrastructure gaps, for example, remains critical.
但只有在各国都保护其母语并且公民们不让英语占领所有重要领域的前提下，英语和其他国家的语言才能够共存。	But English and national languages can co-exist only if the state protects the indigenous language and citizens do not allow English to take over all prestigious domains.
为什么在她们的州滑向毁灭边缘的时候，这些在华盛顿的政治家们却置若罔闻呢？ 这在相当程度上说明了美国政治中的失败之处。	Why these Washington politicians are idle while their state slides towards ruin says much about what’s broken in American politics.
但情况每况愈下，部分是因为中国经济减速、大宗商品繁荣结束、国际金融条件趋紧、全球增长萎靡和多年来的政策管理不善。	But the situation has only deteriorated, owing partly to China’s economic slowdown, the end of the commodity boom, tighter international financial conditions, weak global growth, and a years-long legacy of policy mismanagement.
在劳动收入下降的同时，政府对存款利率设置了上限，而是银行存款是大部分家庭的主要储蓄方式，导致家庭的资本收入偏低。	Concurrent with diminishing labor income, government-imposed ceilings on bank deposits – the primary savings vehicle for most households – have held down household capital income.
阿拉伯国家向更多元政治发展的走向令社会对警务工作的性质和宗旨产生了严重分歧 — — 而这些分歧对又反过来令改革进程变得复杂化。	The move toward more pluralist politics in Arab states has unleashed deep social divides over the nature and purpose of policing – divides that invariably complicate the reform process.
BNP似乎将宗教极端主义看作一个打破反对党 — — 受到世俗主义的城市中产阶级大力支持的孟加拉国人民联盟（Awami League）权力的武器。	The BNP appears to view religious extremism as a tool to break the power of the opposition Awami League, which is largely supported by the secular and urban middle classes.
相反，风险存在于增长如何实现的方式上 — — 换句话说，过度依赖于过时且消耗性的增长模式，而不是全面采用新的模式。	Rather, the risk lies in the manner in which this growth is likely to materialize – namely, by depending too much on old and exhausted growth models, rather than by comprehensively embracing new ones.
债务水平和剩余赤字意味着需要非常小心，但是，只要存在采取行动的共同意愿，就有在欧洲规则框架内调整的空间。	Debt levels and remaining deficits underscore the need for extreme caution, but, assuming a common will to undertake action, there would be room for maneuver within the European rules.
所有这些都是通过一个叫作ooniprobe的软件曝光的。 这个软件是为了测量网络、侦测网络审查而设计。	All of this was uncovered through the use of software called ooniprobe, which is designed to measure networks and detect Internet censorship.
从发展中国家向发达国家的移民形成最大的生产率增幅，因此这些目的国收获了移民对全球GDP总贡献的90 % 。	Because flows from developing to developed countries generate the largest productivity increases, these destinations account for more than 90% of migrants’ total contribution to global GDP.
特蕾莎修女曾在加尔各答贫民窟与结核病患者相处数十年，她观察的结果是 ， “ 当今最严重的疾病不是麻风病和结核病，而是被社会抛弃的感觉 。 ”	Mother Teresa worked for decades with TB’s victims in the slums of Calcutta, and observed that, “The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the feeling of being unwanted.”
萨尔科奇所喜欢的<<星期日>>杂志报导说两人打算结婚引发大众猜测婚礼究竟何时举行。 二人已经交换定情物。	The news in Sarkozy’s favored media outlet Journal du Dimanche that the couple plan to marry touched off a flurry of fevered speculation on when the happy event might occur.
在1999年，随着尼日利亚独裁统治的垮台和民主政治的引进，主要是穆斯林的北部省份的地方长官认为他们已经和南部的地方长官就两地轮流担任国家总统达成了共识。	With the fall of Nigeria’s dictatorship and the introduction of democracy in 1999, governors in the mainly Muslim northern provinces believed they had struck a deal with their southern counterparts on a regional rotation of the country’s presidency.
这包括推广能提高一线疗法效力的全新药物系列，以此来缩短治疗时间，从根本上防止耐药性的出现。 但光有新药是不够的。	This includes promoting new drugs lines that can enhance the potency of first-line regimens, thereby shortening treatment duration and preventing the emergence of resistance in the first place. But new drugs are not enough.
20世纪30年代初，在经历了一段时间相对自由的国际贸易后，出现了极端保护主义，最终为第二次世界大战埋下了祸根。	Extreme protectionism in the early 1930s, following an era of relatively free international trade, had devastating consequences, ultimately setting the stage for World War II.
许多选民似乎并未感觉到自身境遇有所改善，而这种感觉也是有道理的：在历经七年的痛苦煎熬之后，人均收入依然没有抬头迹象。	Too many voters, it seems, still do not feel better off, and for good reason: average incomes have barely begun to rise, following seven painful years.
年收入低于35,000美元家庭的儿童学习无能比例比年收入高于100,000美元家庭的儿童高出近一倍。	Learning disabilities occur almost twice as frequently among children in households earning less than $35,000 a year than they do in households earning more than $100,000.
此外，如果按照拟议中的方案，上述税收（现已遭到废除）既非收入中性也并非旨在为帮助法国苦苦挣扎的家庭（尤其是在农村和小城市地区）的项目提供资金。	Moreover, as proposed, the tax (which has now been rescinded) was neither revenue-neutral nor intended to fund expenditures aimed at helping France’s struggling households, especially in rural areas and smaller cities.
但是一种越来越充满敌意的、伊斯兰教和人道主义、基督教和犹太教传统之间的文化冲突正在欧洲出现 — — 尤其在法国、德国、西班牙和荷兰。	But an increasingly virulent and violent clash of cultures is emerging in Europe – particularly in France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands – between Islam and the humanitarian, Christian, and Jewish traditions.
尽管伊拉克战争和2010年12月开始的阿拉伯革命间不存在因果关系，但两者的影响已经以恶性的方式互相结合。	While there is no causal link between the Iraq war and the Arab revolutions that began in December 2010, their implications have combined in a malign manner.
然后，他们又清醒过来，看清了现实：其实没什么大的改变，几周或几月之后，老问题会重新出现，而且变得更棘手。	Then they awaken to the reality that not much has really changed, and that in a few weeks or months the problems will reappear in a seemingly even more intractable form.
即便是该计划的最佳部分 — — 即准备（但并未实际通过）让希腊主权债务的私人投资者损失50 % — —也不足以稳定希腊沉重的债务和增长问题。	Even the best part of the plan, the proposed (but not really agreed) 50% haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt, is not sufficient to stabilize that country’s profound debt and growth problems.
举了例子，假设希腊政府希望为其颓败的经济吸引6000个就业岗位而承诺向苹果公司提供每个岗位每年11万欧元，或者一次性6.6亿欧元的补贴。	Suppose, for example, that the Greek government, seeking to attract 6,000 jobs to its ravaged economy, offered Apple a subsidy of €110,000 per job per year, or €660 million.
一向狂热的中国宣传部门官员显然害怕自己没有对新的党委总书记展示足够的忠诚和尊重，很快就劫持了这个口号；中国梦已经取代了官方政治宣传中的“中国模式”标牌。	China’s ever-zealous propaganda officials, evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for the new party chief, quickly hijacked the slogan; the China Dream has replaced the “China Model” in official political branding.
官方统计说美国有15%的贫困人口，但如果我们把那些在医疗，住房，就业等方面苦苦挣扎的家庭计算在内的话，实际的数目会更加庞大，但民主共和两党却对此绝口不提。	Neither party even mentions the poor, who now officially make up 15% of the population but in fact are even more numerous, when we count all those households struggling with health care, housing, jobs, and other needs.
他们会齐心协力创造一个没有核武器的世界，在上述世界中法治而非暴力才是至高无上的准则，合作才是实现国际和平最好的担保。	They will work to achieve a world in which such weapons are no more – where the rule of law, not the rule of force, reigns supreme, and cooperation is seen as the best guarantor of international peace.
但决策者不应该因此而忽略其他东西，乃至无法为其他两起可能的风暴 — — 以及更加令人担心的，为它们汇聚形成灾难性完美风暴的可能性做好准备。	But policymakers should not be so distracted by it that they fail to prepare for the other two possible storms – and, much more worrisome, the possibility that they merge into a single more devastating one.
学生们被迫参加难道变态的考试 — — 每年参加IIT联考的人数有500,000，只有大约10,000能上线 — — 而他们往往很讨厌这些考试科目。	Students are forced to pass brutally difficult examinations – only about 10,000 of the 500,000 who take the IIT-JEE each year score high enough to be admitted – in subjects they often detest.
他们的假设 — — 并没有明说，也很可疑 — — 是在可预见的未来，美国仍能以极低的利率出售任意数量的国债。	The assumption here – unstated and highly questionable – is that the US will be able to sell an unlimited amount of government debt at low interest rates for the foreseeable future.
仍有可能，土耳其政府找到办法释放布朗森，而美国总统特朗普 — — 他急于向其核心票仓之一的福音派表忠心 — — 将取消关税。	It is still possible that the Turkish government will find a way to release Brunson, and that US President Donald Trump, anxious to demonstrate fealty to the evangelicals who form a core part of his base, will rescind the tariffs.
而随着巩固财政还是确保增长的辩论日趋激烈，显然除了实施大规模刺激政策之外，在如何启动经济方面并未形成多少共识。	As the debate on fiscal consolidation versus growth intensifies, it is clear that there is little agreement on how to kick-start the economy, beyond fielding broad stimulus packages.
如今，在位居广受关注的《美国新闻和世界报道 》 （ US News and World Report）大学排名20强的大学中，有19所是由校友控制的（以校董事会人数超过半数为标准 ） 。	Today, 19 of the top 20 American universities in US News and World Report’s much-watched rankings are controlled by alumni (defined as 50% or more representation on the Board of Trustees).
此外，不仅日本经济中的贸易部门极易受到中国经济放缓的影响，最近在尖阁列岛/钓鱼岛问题上的冲突也提升了经济减速的预期。	Moreover, not only is the tradable sector of Japan’s economy highly vulnerable to a slowdown in China, but the recent conflict over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands raises the prospect of economic decoupling.
中国电影<<卧虎藏龙>>成为非英语电影中最高收入影片，而像<<季风婚礼>>那样的印度电影则成为全球票房收入的成功典型。	The Chinese film “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” became the highest grossing non-English film, and Indian movies like “Monsoon Wedding” were global box-office successes.
事实上，德国成功降低了其总公共债务，从2012年占GDP的79.7%下降到去年的71 % ， 但法国和（特别是）意大利尽管采取了严厉的财政控制，债务比继续攀升。	Indeed, while Germany has managed to reduce its gross public debt, from 79.7% of GDP in 2012 to 71% last year, debt ratios in France and Italy have continued to rise, despite tight fiscal controls (especially in Italy).
在加纳，一种维生素和矿物质强化的新型婴儿玉米食品填补了市场空白，它价格低廉，且可以与母乳喂养自然结合。	In Ghana, a new instant maize-based product, enriched with vitamins and minerals, is the first of its kind on the market, owing to its affordability and natural integration with breastfeeding.
G20的领袖们需要再度处理棘手的国内压力，走出狭隘的议题并抵受住民粹主义的诱惑 — — 以证明那些怀疑论者都是大错特错了。	G-20 leaders need again to manage difficult domestic pressures, overcome narrow agendas and resist populist temptations – and prove the sceptics wrong.
对投资者来说，西班牙房地产资产是伟大的投资，因为欧元所带来的经济趋同的力量必然会提升其价格，也因为西班牙不再有可以贬值的比塞塔。	To investors, Spanish housing assets seemed a great investment, because the forces of economic convergence unleashed by the euro would surely push up their prices – and because there was no peseta that could lose value.
此外还需要一些收入再分配，从而让低收入工人能够投资自己 — — 当他们连覆盖基本需要都难以实现时，很难做到投资自己。	Furthermore, some income redistribution will be needed, in order to enable low-income workers to invest in themselves – which is impossible when they have just enough to cover their basic needs.
类似地，被解职的公诉官没有拿出任何有力证据证明被指控杀戮示威者的穆巴拉克的安全主管和官员的罪行，导致他们几乎全被无罪释放了。	Likewise, the sacked public prosecutor had failed to present any solid evidence against those of Mubarak’s security chiefs and officers who were accused of killing protestors, leading to acquittals for almost all of them.
如果建立在比共同利益更为深厚的东西之上，那就有所帮助。 这些东西包括语言、共同的历史感以及为文化成就而自豪。	It helps if this is based on something deeper than shared interests: a language, a sense of common history, pride in cultural achievements.
高频交易带来的快速又巨大的转变很可能继续。 交易速度低于一秒一次才过了十年，现在其速度已经与眨眼一样快了。	Indeed, HFT firms talk of a “race to zero,” the point at which trading takes place at close to the speed of light.
于是在年轻埃米尔的铁腕领导下 ， “ 半岛电视台”对两国政府发动了长年的攻击，几乎将卡塔尔和这两个国家的外交关系推上绝路。	In response, under the young Emir’s firm hand, Al Jazeera delivered a more assertive line of criticism against governments, such as those of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, that other Arab mainstream media would do their best to avoid alienating.
近几年来，公投往往不合决策者之意 — — 法国、荷兰和爱尔兰皆是如此 — — 因此没人希望走到这一步。	Given how often such referenda have been defeated in recent years – for example, in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland – that is a scenario that everyone wants to avoid.
在这种情况下开展测试只会带来极大的不安全性，导致对携带者造成不必要的困扰并给非携带者及其亲属带来虚假的安全感。	In these circumstances, testing them would only provoke massive insecurity, leading to unnecessary interventions in carriers and a false sense of security in non-carriers, as well as in their relatives.
用世界经济论坛创始人克劳斯·施瓦布的话讲 ， “ 只有释放其全部人才能力的经济体才能保持竞争优势，实现持续繁荣。	In the words of Klaus Schwab, the WEF’s founder, “Only those economies which have full access to all their talent will remain competitive and will prosper.
为了抵消由此带来的一些税收收入损失，新税法可能会取消州和地方税收抵扣，并对某些目前享受非税待遇的福利性收入征税。	To offset some of the resulting revenue loss, the new law might eliminate tax deductions for state and local taxes, and tax some of the fringe benefits that are currently excluded from taxable income.
通过用正式的和平协议来取代64年前的停战协定，就可以为针对核武升级以及其他区域稳定威胁的更广泛讨论铺平道路。	A dialogue to replace the 64-year-old armistice with a formal peace agreement could pave the way for broader discussions about nuclear escalation and other threats to regional stability.
有关石油生产的“哈伯特顶峰”理论认为，我们已经达到了生产能力的上限，油井已经干枯，石油产量将从此下滑。 如今，这一理论的信徒为数众多。	Nowadays, there are many adherents of the “Hubbert’s peak” theory of oil production, which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity, the wells are running dry, and it is all downhill from here.
以人均国内生产总值为例，其反映了一个国家的平均劳动生产率和整体工业技术成就，也是估算后发优势的一个有效标示物。	Per capita GDP, which reflects a country’s average labor productivity and its overall technological and industrial achievement, is a useful proxy to estimate latecomer’s advantage.
要求银行要有更高的股本对大经济来说是有好处的 — — 这让金融危机(和停滞的经济状态)变得更不可能，不那么严重或者两者兼而有之。	Higher equity-capital requirements for banks are good for the broader economy – they make financial crises (and the zombie-syndrome) less likely, less severe, or both.
无论如何，如果一国已经过度负债，那么可能发现无论多少实际调整和融资都不足够 — — 这个诅咒被经济学家称为“债务积压 ” 。	In any case, if a country is already too deeply indebted, it may find that no amount of realistic adjustment and financing is enough – the curse of what economists call the “debt overhang.”
他与Rawls进行过极其有价值的智慧讨论，这促使他写了几篇有关经济公正理论的论文以及在1974年出版了一本专著，这本书今天仍在被使用。	He had extremely valuable intellectual conversations with Rawls, prompting him to write several essays on the theory of economic justice and publish a book on the subject in 1974 – a book still used today.
换句话说，尽管特朗普的王朝宫廷给美国造成了一个问题，但作为隐喻，它也提供了一个解决办法 — — 它点燃了美国人对君主制的与生俱来的怀疑。	In other words, while Trump’s princely court poses a problem for America, as a metaphor, it could also provide a solution, by stoking Americans’ natural suspicion of monarchy.
正如牛津大学经济学家约翰·穆尔鲍尔（John Muellbauer）所说，国债和央行已经“将减少政府总负债相对GDP比率的重要性深深地根植到私人部门的意识中了 ” 。	As the Oxford economist John Muellbauer says, treasuries and central banks have been “hammering into the consciousness of the private sector the importance of reducing gross government debt relative to GDP.”
耐药性结核病的发病率正在上升，因为贫穷国家的医疗卫生系统缺乏筛查结核病的资源和帮助患者接受治疗的方法。	The incidence of drug-resistant TB is on the rise, because the health-care systems of poor countries lack the resources to screen for TB and to help patients comply with their therapies.
其他顾问警告他，任何可能的行动 — — 比如，在土耳其边境设立可以向外扩展的安全区 — — 都需要在整个叙利亚部署防空力量。	Other advisers warn him that any possible action – a safe zone on the Turkish border, for example, that could expand outward – requires taking out anti-aircraft defenses all over Syria.
麦肯锡全球研究所（MGI）的新研究发现，在此期间，商品、服务、金融、人员和数据的跨境流动将世界GDP推高了10%左右 — — 光是在2014年，就增加了7.8万亿美元。	New research from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) finds that cross-border flows of goods, services, finance, people, and data during this period increased world GDP by roughly 10% – roughly an additional $7.8 trillion in 2014 alone.
更低的出生率使得停滞永久化，汉森推断说，因为人们不需要在孩子身上花这么多钱，也觉得不必为未来进行那么多投资。	Fewer births perpetuated the stagnation, Hansen surmised, because people did not need to spend as much on children, and felt less need to invest in the future.
然而，在共同货币引入后第一个 10 年间，欧元区大行其道的不是迅速同化，而是不断异化。 欧元区各国关系将进一步紧张。	After the common currency’s first decade, however, increased divergence, rather than rapid convergence, has become the norm within the euro area, and tensions can be expected to increase further.
关键基本服务 — — 如教育和医疗 — — 的公共供给也许永远不如私人部门替代方案那样高效；但在高效率会造成排斥和机会不平等的领域，公共供给并不是错误。	Public provision of critical basic services like education or health care may never be as efficient as private-sector alternatives; but where efficiency entails exclusion and inequality of opportunity, public provision is not a mistake.
