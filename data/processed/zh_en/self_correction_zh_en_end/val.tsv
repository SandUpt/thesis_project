德国和欧盟也可以提供贷款承诺，但是这不如 IMF 贷款来得好，因为此类承诺难以附加一些贷款条件，就算附加了也难以执行。"	"Initial translation: Germany and the European Union could provide a loan commitment, but this would be less desirable than an IMF loan, because it would be difficult to attach additional loan conditions, and even more difficult to enforce them if they were attached.

Analysis: The model changes the grammatical structure from discussing ""loan guarantees"" as a subject to ""could provide a loan commitment,"" which shifts the focus. The model also breaks the flow by adding ""and even more difficult to enforce them if they were attached,"" which is wordier than the original's more concise phrasing. The phrase ""attach additional loan conditions"" suggests adding conditions beyond existing ones, when the original means attaching conditionality in general. The model's version sounds more tentative with ""could provide"" versus the original's statement that guarantees ""are less desirable

Corrected translation: Loan guarantees from Germany and/or the EU are less desirable than an IMF program, as it is very hard to design and credibly implement conditionality in such guarantees.|||END|||"	error_correction	德国和欧盟也可以提供贷款承诺，但是这不如 IMF 贷款来得好，因为此类承诺难以附加一些贷款条件，就算附加了也难以执行。	Loan guarantees from Germany and/or the EU are less desirable than an IMF program, as it is very hard to design and credibly implement conditionality in such guarantees.

Analysis: The model changes ""less than 100 days"" to ""barely 10 days,"" which is a significant numerical error. It also completely restructures the sentence with a comparison to previous chief executives that is not in the original. The phrase ""already lost more of his reputation...than any previous chief executive"" is an addition that changes the meaning

"The model translation is ""As a result, Pakistan's judiciary, media, and many civil-society organizations are now committed not only to limiting the military, but also to stopping the looting that is taking place in the new political system.""
The model uses ""stopping the looting"" which is too literal and crude compared to ""constrain the political establishment's rapacious behavior."" The phrase ""rapacious behavior"" captures predatory conduct more precisely than ""looting."" The model also loses the nuance of ""engaged in attempts"" by using the stronger ""committed,"" which suggests more certain success.
