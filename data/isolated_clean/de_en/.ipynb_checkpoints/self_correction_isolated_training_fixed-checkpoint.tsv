On Wednesday, the mileage was cut by another 25%.	Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""On Wednesday, the mileage was cut by another 25%.""
The German ""noch einmal auf 25 Prozent der Flugstrecke gekürzt"" should be ""slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip"" not ""cut by another 25%"" - this is about reducing TO 25%, not BY 25%. The word ""Meilen"" should be ""mileage award"" not just ""mileage"" - this is about reward points, not distance measurement. The phrase ""der Flugstrecke"" should be ""of the miles of the trip"" not omitted entirely. The grammatical structure ""cut by"" versus ""slashed...to"" changes the mathematical meaning significantly.
The correct translation should be ""On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.""|||END|||"	error_correction

The phrase ""lobenswerte Sachen"" should be ""pieces you can praise"" (clothing items) not ""things to praise"" generally. The phrase ""was man dazu tragen kann"" should be ""what to wear them with"" not ""which you can contribute to"" - this is about fashion coordination, not charitable contribution.

The German sentence structure has two distinct parts, but the model omits the key second sentence. The phrase ""an manchen Stellen den anderen Wagen nur leicht"" should be ""you sometimes lightly touch the other car"" not ""touch the other car lightly in some places"" - ""Stellen"" refers to occasions, not physical locations. The second part ""in anderen, nahezu identischen Situation kommt man aber ins Schleudern und dreht wilde Pirouetten"" should be ""Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes"" - the model captured this but lost the structural separation and the ""wild pirouettes"" reference.

The German ""Brücken"" (plural) should be ""bridges"" not ""bridge"" (singular) - there are multiple bridges. The phrase ""Bauhofgebäude"" should be ""construction yard building"" not just ""building"" - missing the specific type. The word ""Sammelweiher"" should be ""lake reservoir"" not ""pond"" - this is a larger water collection facility. The phrase ""einspurig durch eine Ampel geregelt"" should be ""single-lane and regulated by lights"" not ""one-way through a traffic light"" - single-lane means alternating directions, not permanent one-way flow.

The phrase ""nicht mehr zu schaffen"" emphasizes the physical/mental capability to complete the journey, which the reference captures with ""be able to drive all the way home"" while the model's ""make it home"" is more generic.

The phrase ""der Schläfer"" should be ""one"" referring to one person in a double bed context, not ""the sleepers"" which suggests multiple people.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vespers service.""
The German ""Bereits seit 15 Jahren"" should be ""It was 15 years ago that the Kaul family first invited"" not ""For 15 years now"" - this changes from a specific starting point to ongoing duration. The word ""Vesper"" should be ""snack"" not ""Vespers service"" - this is a German term for an afternoon snack, not a religious service.

Named Entity Error	"The model translation is ""Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goal-getter in the storm of the foals.""
The German ""im Sturm der Fohlen"" should be ""in the ofensive of 'die Fohlen'"" not ""in the storm of the foals"" - ""Sturm"" in football context means ""offense/attack,"" not weather storm. The team name ""Fohlen"" should be presented as ""die Fohlen"" (with quotation marks) as it's a nickname, not translated as ""the foals."" The word ""zusehends"" should be implied in ""proves to be"" rather than explicitly translated as ""increasingly"" - different emphasis. The model literalized football terminology and lost the team nickname formatting.
The correct translation should be ""Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter in the ofensive of ""die Fohlen"".""|||END|||"	error_correction

Auch an die Damen ist gedacht - ihnen gönnt man diese Weichzonen in der Hüftgegend.	They also remember the women - those indulge in the softer surface of the hip area.	The ladies are also catered for - they are allowed to have soft spots in the hip area.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""The ladies are also catered for - they are allowed to have soft spots in the hip area.""
The German ""an die Damen ist gedacht"" means ""they remember the women"" (considering/thinking of them) not just ""catered for."" The phrase ""gönnt man"" means ""indulge"" rather than ""allowed to have"" - it suggests treating/pampering rather than permission. The term ""Weichzonen"" should be ""softer surface"" not ""soft spots,"" and ""Hüftgegend"" is ""hip area"" which was correct. The model lost the pampering/indulgence connotation and made it sound more clinical.
The correct translation should be ""They also remember the women - those indulge in the softer surface of the hip area.""|||END|||"	error_correction

Die tollen Treffer aus dem Perimeter heraus mit 16 bewerteten Dreifachen trugen maβgeblich zu ihrem endgültigen Sieg bei.	Additionally, their huge success from the sidelines, with 16 three pointers scored, had a lot to do with the final triumph.	The wonderful long-range strikes from outside the perimeter with 16 assessed triples were a major factor in their final victory.	Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""The wonderful long-range strikes from outside the perimeter with 16 assessed triples were a major factor in their final victory.""
The German ""Perimeter"" should be translated as ""sidelines"" in basketball context, not kept as ""perimeter."" The phrase ""bewerteten Dreifachen"" should be ""three pointers scored"" not ""assessed triples"" - this is basketball terminology. The word ""tollen"" should be ""huge success"" rather than ""wonderful"" to match the sports commentary tone.

The German ""vor allem die Importe aus dem hohen Norden"" should be ""It is above all the imports from the high north"" not just ""the imports from the north are the key"" - the model omitted ""hohen"" (high) and changed the sentence structure. The phrase ""beim Suchsdorfer SV sorgen"" was completely omitted - this should be ""that bring class and stability to Suchsdorfer SV."" The model generalized the statement instead of specifying which team benefits. The emphatic structure ""It is above all...that"" was simplified to ""are the key.""

Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""What was not mentioned was the total amount still owed to her and the number of cheques that are still being issued in her favour.""
The German ""Was nicht erwähnt wurde"" should be ""What wasn't reported"" not ""What was not mentioned"" - ""erwähnt"" in this context is about reporting, not just mentioning. The phrase ""die man ihr noch schuldet"" means ""that still has to be paid"" not ""still owed to her"" - it's about general payment obligation, not specifically to her. The word ""infolgedessen"" means ""therefore"" which was omitted, breaking the logical connection. The model also added ""that are still being issued in her favour"" which doesn't match the target about checks to be written.

Omission/Addition Error	"The model translation is ""When you get on the bus, the chip card has to be presented not only to the driver but also to the ticket machine, which is marked out.""
The German ""Opencard ist an eine gekennzeichnete Stelle an der Seite der Kasse anzulegen"" should be ""it is necessary to place the Opencard on the designated spot on the side of the cash register"" not ""to the ticket machine, which is marked out."" The model missed the specific action of placing the card on a designated spot and generalized to ""ticket machine."" The phrase ""anzulegen"" means to place against/on, not to present to. The model also omitted ""in addition it is necessary"" which emphasizes the additional requirement.

The German ""Einwohner des Urlaubsorts"" should be ""Residents"" not ""The tourists who visit the resort"" - this is a major semantic error where the model confused residents with tourists. The phrase ""schreiben ihm die Entwicklung des Tourismus und den Aufbau der Infrastruktur zu"" should be ""credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure"" not ""write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure"" - this is a semantic error where the model was too literal with ""schreiben zu"" which means ""to credit/attribute to"" not literally ""write to"".

The German ""Hier gab es noch Reserven"" was completely misunderstood - it should be ""That was our weakness"" not ""There were still reserves"" - the semantic meaning is opposite. The word ""Reserven"" in this sports context means ""weakness"" or ""room for improvement,"" not literal reserves. The punctuation is also wrong with a single quote instead of proper quotation marks. The grammatical structure ""einer der Abwehrspieler"" should be ""a defender"" not ""one of the defencemen"" for more natural English.

The German ""gelbgesichtig"" and ""Gelbgesicht"" refer to ""yellowface"" (the racist practice of portraying Asian characters with yellow makeup) but the model translated this as ""yellow-tinted"" and ""yellow-tint"" which completely misses the cultural and racist connotations.
