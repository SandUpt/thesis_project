全球实体工程师（各国决策层 ） — —剔除那些有个人财务利益诉求的少数 — — 应该抵制这些负面解读，虽然不能幻想找到速效药。	The real engineers, excluding those whose judgment is clouded by personal financial interests, should counter this influence, while refusing to succumb to the temptation of quick fixes.	Global bodies of engineers (that is, national decision-makers) – excluding the minority with personal financial interests – should resist such negative interpretations, though they should not expect a quick fix to be found.	Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""Global bodies of engineers (that is, national decision-makers) – excluding the minority with personal financial interests – should resist such negative interpretations, though they should not expect a quick fix to be found."" The model translated a key term as ""bodies"" when it means ""real"" in this context, resulting in ""bodies of engineers"" instead of ""real engineers."" The model also used ""that is"" to equate engineers with decision-makers, which creates confusion about whether they are the same group or different groups. The correct translation should be ""The real engineers, excluding those whose judgment is clouded by personal financial interests, should counter this influence, while refusing to succumb to the temptation of quick fixes."""
埃塞克斯大学和澳大利亚国立大学的蒂莫西·哈顿（Timothy J. Hatton）的一篇文章考察了全球难民流以研究背后的驱动因素。	One of the papers, by Timothy J. Hatton of the University of Essex and Australian National University, examined refugee flows around the world, to see what drives them.	In a paper examining the drivers of global refugee flows, Timothy J Hatton of the University of Essex and the Australian National University found that the number of refugees has risen in recent decades, but that the rate of increase has slowed in recent years.	Omission/Addition Error	"The model translation is ""In a paper examining the drivers of global refugee flows, Timothy J Hatton of the University of Essex and the Australian National University found that the number of refugees has risen in recent decades, but that the rate of increase has slowed in recent years."" The model added content that does not exist in the source text. The Chinese only mentions examining refugee flows to study driving factors, but the model invented findings about refugee numbers rising and rates slowing. The correct translation should be ""One of the papers, by Timothy J. Hatton of the University of Essex and Australian National University, examined refugee flows around the world, to see what drives them."""
但好社会是这样的：你不必是幸运儿，受到的教育也不会差，吃的食物也不会不健康，做的工作也不会让你感到暗无天日。	But a good society is one in which you do not have to get lucky to avoid a life of poor education, unhealthy food, and dead-end jobs.	But a good society is one in which you don’t have to be lucky to get a good education, to eat healthy food, to have a job that doesn’t make you miserable, and so on and so forth.	Fluency Error	"The model translation is ""But a good society is one in which you don't have to be lucky to get a good education, to eat healthy food, to have a job that doesn't make you miserable, and so on and so forth."" The phrase ""and so on and so forth"" at the end is unnecessary padding that does not reflect the source text and makes the translation sound casual. The model also used the contraction ""don't"" which is less formal. The correct translation should be ""But a good society is one in which you do not have to get lucky to avoid a life of poor education, unhealthy food, and dead-end jobs."""
2000年底，互联网股票繁荣到达顶峰并且在2001年的崩溃发生之前，经济学家格拉斯曼和哈塞特发表amplt;amplt;道指36000点ampgt;ampgt;一书。	At the end of 2000, at the height of the Internet stock boom and just before the 2001 crash, the economists James Glassman and Kevin Hassett published Dow 36,000 .	At the peak of the Internet stock boom at the end of the 1990’s, the economists Nouriel Roubini and Brad DeLong published a book, Bubbles and Crashes: The Booms and Busts of Record Stock Prices, which argued that the Dow could reach 36,002.

The Chinese clearly names the authors as Glassman and Hassett, but the model completely replaced them with different economists Roubini and DeLong. It also changed the time from ""end of 2000"" to ""end of the 1990s"" and invented a fake book title. The correct translation should be ""At the end of 2000, at the height of the Internet stock boom and just before the 2001 crash, the economists James Glassman and Kevin Hassett published Dow 36,000."""
然而，在中欧和东欧数以千记的政治犯可以证明下列事实：秘密警察在街头上的暴行造成的伤害与监狱里看守人的虐待造成的伤害一样严重。	However, thousands of former political prisoners in central and eastern Europe can attest to the fact that a kick from a secret policeman on the street hurts just as much as a kick from a warden behind prison gates.	Yet the tens of thousands of political prisoners in Central and Eastern Europe can attest to the fact that the brutality of the secret police in the streets was no less damaging than that of the guards in the prisons and camps.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Yet the tens of thousands of political prisoners in Central and Eastern Europe can attest to the fact that the brutality of the secret police in the streets was no less damaging than that of the guards in the prisons and camps."" The model changed ""thousands of former political prisoners"" to ""tens of thousands of political prisoners,"" adding emphasis that does not exist in the original. More importantly, it changed the meaning from saying a street kick hurts as much as a prison kick, to saying street brutality was as damaging as prison guard brutality overall, which generalizes the specific point. The correct translation should be ""However, thousands of former political prisoners in central and eastern Europe can attest to the fact that a kick from a secret policeman on the street hurts just as much as a kick from a warden behind prison gates."""
尽管如此，最近的价格疯狂蔓延到了众多尚在人世的艺术家，首屈一指的是美国人杰夫·昆斯（Jeff Koons）和德国人格哈德·里希特（Gerhard Richter ） ， 并且波及许多名声并不那么响亮的艺术家。	Nevertheless, the recent price frenzy extends to a significant number of living artists, led by the American Jeff Koons and the German Gerhard Richter, and extending well down the food chain.	Nevertheless, the recent price frenzy has spread to many living artists, most notably the Americans Jeff Koons and Gerhard Richтер, and to many less well-known artists.	Named Entity Error	"The model translation is ""Nevertheless, the recent price frenzy has spread to many living artists, most notably the Americans Jeff Koons and Gerhard Richтер, and to many less well-known artists."" The model incorrectly labeled Gerhard Richter as American when the source clearly states he is German. The model also changed ""extending well down the food chain"" to the more generic ""to many less well-known artists,"" losing the vivid metaphor. The correct translation should be ""Nevertheless, the recent price frenzy extends to a significant number of living artists, led by the American Jeff Koons and the German Gerhard Richter, and extending well down the food chain."""
邓小平暂时退隐，让围绕在党元老陈云身边的主张计划经济的人士放慢市场化脚步，并在后天安门事件时期国际上孤立中国的形势下韬光养晦。	Deng temporarily withdrew, letting the central planners around Party elder Chen Yun slow down marketization and weather the PRC’s international isolation in Tiananmen’s wake.	Deng temporarily retreated, allowing the advocates of a planned economy who surrounded Party elder Chen Yun to slow the pace of marketization, only to emerge from international isolation in the wake of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 to resume the offensive with a vengeance.	Omission/Addition Error	"The model translation is ""Deng temporarily retreated, allowing the advocates of a planned economy who surrounded Party elder Chen Yun to slow the pace of marketization, only to emerge from international isolation in the wake of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 to resume the offensive with a vengeance."" The model added content about Deng emerging and resuming an offensive that does not exist in the source text. The Chinese only describes Deng withdrawing to let planners slow marketization and weather isolation, not about him later returning. The correct translation should be ""Deng temporarily withdrew, letting the central planners around Party elder Chen Yun slow down marketization and weather the PRC's international isolation in Tiananmen's wake."""
在竞争力改善之前，经济将跌入无通胀或通缩的泪水之谷，因此有理由怀疑以当选为目标的目光短浅的政客是否能够坚持住。	Given that disinflation or deflation leads through a valley of tears before competitiveness improves, there is reason to doubt whether election-minded politicians, with their short-term orientation, are capable of staying the course.	Before competitiveness improves, the economy will sink into a morass of disinflation or deflation, so there is reason to doubt whether politicians with short-sighted electoral objectives will be able to stick to their guns.	Fluency Error	"The model translation is ""Before competitiveness improves, the economy will sink into a morass of disinflation or deflation, so there is reason to doubt whether politicians with short-sighted electoral objectives will be able to stick to their guns."" The phrase ""sink into a morass"" is overly dramatic compared to the more neutral ""valley of tears"" metaphor. The model also changed ""election-minded politicians, with their short-term orientation"" to ""politicians with short-sighted electoral objectives,"" which is wordier and less natural. The correct translation should be ""Given that disinflation or deflation leads through a valley of tears before competitiveness improves, there is reason to doubt whether election-minded politicians, with their short-term orientation, are capable of staying the course."""
除邻国索马里无休无止的混乱局势外，长期在位的总理梅莱斯·泽纳维是摆在埃塞俄比亚面前最令人生畏的区域挑战。	Besides the never-ending anarchy of neighboring Somalia, the regional challenges facing Ethiopia and its long-serving prime minister, Meles Zenawi, are daunting.	Beyond the ongoing chaos in neighboring Somalia, Ethiopia’s long-serving prime minister, Meles Zenawi, is one of the most formidable regional challenges facing the country today.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Beyond the ongoing chaos in neighboring Somalia, Ethiopia's long-serving prime minister, Meles Zenawi, is one of the most formidable regional challenges facing the country today."" This completely reverses the meaning. The Chinese says Zenawi is facing challenges, but the model makes Zenawi himself into a challenge. The structure misinterprets who is the subject dealing with problems versus who is the problem. The correct translation should be ""Besides the never-ending anarchy of neighboring Somalia, the regional challenges facing Ethiopia and its long-serving prime minister, Meles Zenawi, are daunting."""
如今，在我们眼前崩溃掉的是“轻监管”体制，在该体制盛行时期，把自己包装成“新工党”的那个政党接受了大市场模式，尤其是大范围地放松了对金融市场的监管。	Today, the equivalent collapse has been of the “regulation-lite” regime in which a party that styled itself as “New Labour” accepted a powerful role for markets – particularly for largely deregulated financial markets.	Today, what is collapsing before our eyes is the “light-touch” regime that prevailed during the heyday of New Labour, when parties that called themselves New Labour embraced the big-market model, particularly the laissez-faire approach to financial markets.	Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""Today, what is collapsing before our eyes is the 'light-touch' regime that prevailed during the heyday of New Labour, when parties that called themselves New Labour embraced the big-market model, particularly the laissez-faire approach to financial markets."" The model changed ""regulation-lite"" to ""light-touch,"" which while similar in meaning is not the exact term used. More problematically, it refers to ""parties"" (plural) that called themselves New Labour, when the source is about one party. It also added ""laissez-faire approach"" which is not in the original. The correct translation should be ""Today, the equivalent collapse has been of the 'regulation-lite' regime in which a party that styled itself as 'New Labour' accepted a powerful role for markets – particularly for largely deregulated financial markets."""
但在见识过发达国家的微观经济动力（这正是中国的目标）之后，这种说法就站不住脚了 — — 因此习近平也不太可能发表类似观点。	But experience with the microeconomic dynamics of advanced economies (where China is headed) makes this a weak stance – and, thus, one that Xi is unlikely to take.	But, having seen the microeconomic dynamism of the advanced countries (which is China’s goal), this argument no longer holds up – and it is unlikely that Xi will make it.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""But, having seen the microeconomic dynamism of the advanced countries (which is China's goal), this argument no longer holds up – and it is unlikely that Xi will make it."" The model misinterprets the meaning by suggesting the argument no longer holds because of what has been seen, when the source says the stance is weak after experiencing advanced economies. The phrase ""this argument no longer holds up"" changes the emphasis from it being a weak stance to it being disproven. The correct translation should be ""But experience with the microeconomic dynamics of advanced economies (where China is headed) makes this a weak stance – and, thus, one that Xi is unlikely to take."""
但事实却的确如此，理事会6月25-26日会议的决议当中就包含上述批准决定 — — 还有明确的提交日期。	But that is what happened, with the endorsement – complete with deliver-by date – buried in the conclusions of the Council’s June 25-26 meeting.	But it did, and the decision to approve – with a clear deadline for submission – was contained in the IMF’s June 25 and 26 resolutions from the Board’s meeting.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""But it did, and the decision to approve – with a clear deadline for submission – was contained in the IMF's June 25 and 26 resolutions from the Board's meeting."" The model incorrectly attributes this to the IMF when the source refers to the Council. The model also changed ""buried in the conclusions"" to ""contained in the resolutions,"" losing the connotation that this decision was hidden or obscured. The phrase ""the IMF's June 25 and 26 resolutions"" is awkward. The correct translation should be ""But that is what happened, with the endorsement – complete with deliver-by date – buried in the conclusions of the Council's June 25-26 meeting."""
这些问题都已被加入了修订版的条约中，它们分别是1972年的海豹保护公约，之后是1980年的野生动物保护公约。	These were added to a revised treaty in 1972 by a convention on seal protection, followed, in 1980, by a convention on wildlife preservation.	All of these issues were addressed in the revised treaty, which was adopted in 1992, first as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and then, in 2003, as CITES-2.	Named Entity Error	"The model translation is ""All of these issues were addressed in the revised treaty, which was adopted in 1992, first as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and then, in 2003, as CITES-2."" The model completely fabricated treaty names and dates that do not exist in the source text. The Chinese mentions seal protection convention in 1972 and wildlife preservation convention in 1980, but the model invented CITES and changed the dates to 1992 and 2003.

如果导致耐多种药物型结核病的同样因素继续发挥作用，那么耐多种药物型结核病将最终转化成为严重耐药型结核病。	If the same factors that produce MDR-TB remain in play, then MDR-TB becomes XDR-TB.	If the same factors that lead to drug-resistant TB continue to operate, MDR-TB will eventually evolve into XDR- TB.	Fluency Error	"The model translation is ""If the same factors that lead to drug-resistant TB continue to operate, MDR-TB will eventually evolve into XDR-TB."" The phrase ""continue to operate"" is less natural than ""remain in play,"" and ""evolve into"" suggests a gradual biological process rather than a transformation caused by the same factors. The model also changed ""produce MDR-TB"" to ""lead to drug-resistant TB,"" which is wordier and less direct. The correct translation should be ""If the same factors that produce MDR-TB remain in play, then MDR-TB becomes XDR-TB."""
波厄（Poher ） 、 沙邦·戴尔马（Chaban-Delmas ） 、 巴利（Barre ） 、 巴拉迪尔（Balladur）还有我本人都在选举开始前两年就被媒体或明或暗地定为夺标热门，但我们最终都逃脱不了失败的厄运。	Poher, Chaban-Delmas, Barre, Balladur, and I were picked out by the media and treated as candidates for more than two years before the election, whether declared or not, and we were all eventually beaten.	The same was true for Poher, Chaban- Delmas, Barre, Balladur, and myself, all of whom were anointed as favorites by the media, explicit or implicit, in the two years before the election, only to end up in the dustbin of history.

The model changed several names, incorrectly writing ""Chaban-Delmas"" instead of maintaining consistency with the source. More importantly, it added the dramatic phrase ""end up in the dustbin of history"" which does not exist in the original text about simply being beaten. The correct translation should be ""Poher, Chaban-Delmas, Barre, Balladur, and I were picked out by the media and treated as candidates for more than two years before the election, whether declared or not, and we were all eventually beaten."""
在美国电台的脱口秀和福克斯电视的鼓噪下，典型的民粹主义者展开了自身的宣传攻势，欧洲的代表人物就是怀尔德斯。	This is a common form of populist paranoia, promoted in the US by radio talk-show hosts and Fox television, and in Europe by men like Wilders.	Fueled by talk radio and Fox News in the United States, typical populists have gone on the offensive, with Nigel Farage being the European face of the movement.	Named Entity Error	"The model translation is ""Fueled by talk radio and Fox News in the United States, typical populists have gone on the offensive, with Nigel Farage being the European face of the movement."" The model replaced Wilders with Nigel Farage, which is a completely different person. The model also added ""have gone on the offensive"" which does not exist in the source, and changed the structure from describing common populist paranoia to describing populist actions. The correct translation should be ""This is a common form of populist paranoia, promoted in the US by radio talk-show hosts and Fox television, and in Europe by men like Wilders."""
同样，在一个欧盟也不受尊敬的地方，我们又该如何做呢？ 至少，我们要制定我们的自己的政策，以努力结束西岸，加沙和约旦东部之间的巴勒斯坦和巴勒斯坦人民的分裂为起点。	At the very least, we could set out our own policy, beginning with an effort to end the fragmentation of Palestine and Palestinians between the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.	Likewise, what should we do in an EU that is not respected? At least, let’s develop our own policies to try to end the separation of Palestine and the Palestinian people between the West Bank, Gaza, and Jordan’s east.	Omission/Addition Error	"The model translation is ""Likewise, what should we do in an EU that is not respected? At least, let's develop our own policies to try to end the separation of Palestine and the Palestinian people between the West Bank, Gaza, and Jordan's east."" The model added ""Likewise"" and the question ""what should we do in an EU that is not respected?"" which creates confusion because this content is not in the source. The model also changed ""East Jerusalem"" to ""Jordan's east,"" which is geographically incorrect.

我向其他印度政客说过，如果你拿枪指着我的头，我肯定会把我的钱包给你，但这不叫送给你 — — 也不意味着我不应该把它拿回来。	As I have pointed out to other Indian politicians, if you hold a gun to my head, I might give you my wallet, but that doesn’t make it a gift – and it doesn’t mean I shouldn’t get it back.	I have told other Indian politicians that if they point a gun at my head, I will give them my wallet, but I will not give it to them – and I will certainly not mean that I should not be able to take it back.	Fluency Error	"The model translation is ""I have told other Indian politicians that if they point a gun at my head, I will give them my wallet, but I will not give it to them – and I will certainly not mean that I should not be able to take it back."" The model creates a logical contradiction by saying ""I will give them my wallet, but I will not give it to them,"" which makes no sense. The structure is awkward and the final clause about meaning is confusing. The correct translation should be ""As I have pointed out to other Indian politicians, if you hold a gun to my head, I might give you my wallet, but that doesn't make it a gift – and it doesn't mean I shouldn't get it back."""
虽然全球根除脊髓灰质炎行动一直持续开展，但应对上述持续爆发的病例非常吃力，而且也未能彻底完成根除脊髓灰质炎的任务。	The effort to tackle these lingering cases is laborious, and it remains incomplete, despite PHEIC status.	While the global polio eradication effort has continued, dealing with these ongoing outbreaks has been difficult, and the task of eradicating polio has not been completed.	Incomplete Translation	"The model translation is ""While the global polio eradication effort has continued, dealing with these ongoing outbreaks has been difficult, and the task of eradicating polio has not been completed."" The model omitted the reference to PHEIC status that is mentioned in the target translation. More importantly, the model fails to convey that the effort is laborious and that work remains incomplete despite PHEIC status. The correct translation should be ""The effort to tackle these lingering cases is laborious, and it remains incomplete, despite PHEIC status."""
前一任噶玛巴于1981年圆寂，对于其继任者的争议自那以后就一直持续，同时也反映出各方对噶举派 — — 藏传佛教中最富有的教派 — — 15亿美元资产的争夺。	The previous Karmapa Lama died in 1981, and the controversy over his successor that has raged ever since also epitomizes a struggle for control of the $1.5 billion in assets held by the Kagyu order, the richest in Tibetan Buddhism.	Disputes over the succession to the previous Panchen Lama, who died in 1991, have continued ever since, reflecting rivalries over the Panchen Lamas’ estimated $1.5 billion in assets.	Named Entity Error	"The model translation is ""Disputes over the succession to the previous Panchen Lama, who died in 1991, have continued ever since, reflecting rivalries over the Panchen Lamas' estimated $1.5 billion in assets."" The model completely changed the subject from the Karmapa Lama to the Panchen Lama, which are different figures in Tibetan Buddhism. It also changed the death year from 1981 to 1991 and changed ""Kagyu order"" to ""Panchen Lamas,"" fundamentally altering the content. The correct translation should be ""The previous Karmapa Lama died in 1981, and the controversy over his successor that has raged ever since also epitomizes a struggle for control of the $1.5 billion in assets held by the Kagyu order, the richest in Tibetan Buddhism."""
这些投票有的只是象征性的（因为奥巴马拥有否决权 ） ； 但重要的事实仍然是，共和党一直在酝酿替代方案，等到共和党成为总统时就可以取ACA而代之。	Those votes may have been merely symbolic, given Obama’s veto power; nonetheless, the striking fact remains that the Republicans never bothered to try to formulate an alternative in the event that one of their own would one day become president.	These votes were only symbolic (because Obama had a veto); but the important fact remains that the Republicans have been cooking up alternatives to the ACA ever since, waiting for a Republican president to enact it.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""These votes were only symbolic (because Obama had a veto); but the important fact remains that the Republicans have been cooking up alternatives to the ACA ever since, waiting for a Republican president to enact it."" The model reverses the meaning. The source says Republicans never bothered to formulate an alternative, but the model says they have been cooking up alternatives ever since. This is the opposite of what the Chinese text conveys.

她的处境比较艰难，可以预料她将经常受到欧盟委员会主席若泽·曼努埃尔·巴罗佐的排挤，因为后者是这次职位分蛋糕的最大赢家。	She has a difficult hand to play, and can expect her elbow to be nudged regularly by EU Commission President José Manuel Barroso, who was the big winner in the carve-up of jobs.	Her position will be difficult, and she can expect to be frequently outmaneuvered by European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, the biggest winner in the job-sharing deal.	Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""Her position will be difficult, and she can expect to be frequently outmaneuvered by European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, the biggest winner in the job-sharing deal."" The model changed ""can expect her elbow to be nudged"" to ""can expect to be frequently outmaneuvered,"" which loses the more subtle connotation of the original metaphor. The model also changed ""carve-up of jobs"" to ""job-sharing deal,"" which has a different tone.

Named Entity Error	"The model translation is ""A new book by Gabriel ZucMAN, The H hidden Wealthof Nations:The Scourges of Tax Havens, exposes in unprecedented detail the role of tax havens in the global economy."" The model mangled the author's name to ""ZucMAN"" (with capital MAN) instead of ""Zucman,"" and the title has spacing errors like ""H hidden Wealthof"" and ""Scourges"" (plural instead of singular). The phrase ""exposes in unprecedented detail"" changes the emphasis from revealing the extent to exposing details. The correct translation should be ""And a new book by Gabriel Zucman, The Hidden Wealth of Nations: The Scourge of Tax Havens, reveals, as never before, the extent of their role in the global economy."""
更糟糕的是，除了给你带来短暂快感之外，果糖不能为任何一个新陈代谢过程所用；它是一种退化的营养物，是植物和动物进化分歧的遗留产物。	Worse yet, other than the ephemeral pleasure that it provides, there is not a single biochemical process that requires dietary fructose; it is a vestigial nutrient, left over from the evolutionary differentiation between plants and animals.	Worse, fructose does not serve any new metabolic process; it is a degenerate nutrient, a relic of the plant-animal evolutionary divide.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Worse, fructose does not serve any new metabolic process; it is a degenerate nutrient, a relic of the plant-animal evolutionary divide."" The model omitted the key point about dietary fructose not being required by any biochemical process and about the ephemeral pleasure it provides.

人们尽可以提到《2010年多德—弗兰克法案》来辩解，但以20世纪30年代的标准来看，那个法案简直是清汤寡水。	Say what you will about the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, but it is weak soup by the standards of the 1930’s.	People can point to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2001 as much as they like, but by the standards of the 1930’s, that act is a mere drop in the bucket.

The model changed the year from 2010 to 2001, which is factually incorrect. The phrase ""a mere drop in the bucket"" changes the metaphor from ""weak soup"" (suggesting diluted or watered-down legislation) to something that is just insufficient in quantity.

此外政府在金融上很难灵活应变；经常被受监管者牵着鼻子走；当光景好的时候，又没有官员愿意去惹怒那些金融机构，给自己找麻烦。	It is not financially nimble; it is often captured by the regulated; and when economic times are good, no official wants to spoil the party.	Furthermore, governments are financially inflexible; they are often led by regulators; and, when things are going well, no official wants to upset the financial institutions and cause trouble for himself or herself.	Fluency Error	"The model translation is ""Furthermore, governments are financially inflexible; they are often led by regulators; and, when things are going well, no official wants to upset the financial institutions and cause trouble for himself or herself."" The phrase ""they are often led by regulators"" is confusing and changes the meaning from ""captured by the regulated"" (meaning regulators are captured by those they regulate).

Unfortunately, it is, to some extent, just that."" The model creates confusing circular logic by saying ""avoiding the issue may be an effort to avoid discussing"" which is redundant. The reference structure is clearer: fudging the issue is to avoid debate about whether something is disguised amnesty. The model's phrase ""whether it is a negotiating tactic that amounts to"" garbles the logic – the question is not whether avoiding discussion is a tactic, but whether the policy itself is amnesty. The phrase ""fortunately"" in the reference indicates the author's positive view of amnesty, but this subtlety is lost. The correct translation should be ""The latter status may or may not include a path to residency and citizenship; fudging the issue may be a negotiating tactic to avoid debate over whether this is a form of disguised amnesty (which, fortunately, to a certain extent, it is)."""
在20世纪90年代末，贸易平衡强化不会带来产出增长或就业创造 — — 它们已经达到了马力全开的成都。	A stronger trade balance in the late 1990s would not have added to output growth or job creation, which were running at full throttle.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""In the late 1990's, trade balance strengthening did not lead to output growth or job creation – they were already at full throttle in Chengdu."" The model makes a bizarre geographical error by adding ""in Chengdu,"" suggesting the economy of one Chinese city when the reference clearly discusses the overall economy. The phrase ""A stronger trade balance... would not have added to"" uses conditional mood to indicate a hypothetical scenario, but the model's ""did not lead to"" treats it as actual history. The model also reverses the logic: the reference says strengthening the trade balance wouldn't help because the economy was already at capacity, not that strengthening happened but didn't help.

The phrase ""two in that four-year period"" in the reference is clearer and avoids this confusion. The model also removes the important point about ""objective criteria"" making it impossible to determine why these crimes merited execution over others. The model's phrasing ""no more rare or shocking than"" reverses the meaning, suggesting all crimes are equally rare/shocking.

比如，德国人后悔在波恩峰会上同意加入了共同财政扩张，因为在通胀肆虐的20世纪70年代末期，再通胀是一个错误的目标。	The Germans, for example, regretted having agreed to joint fiscal expansion at the Bonn summit, because reflation turned out to be the wrong objective in the inflation-plagued late 1970s.

Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""Germans, for example, regret agreeing to a common fiscal expansion at the Bonn summit, because inflation was the wrong target in the inflationary 1970s."" The model uses present tense ""regret"" when it should be past tense ""regretted"" to match the historical context.

Incomplete Translation	"The model translation is ""What lessons can the US draw from the failure of President Bush's 'surge' to produce a 'victory' in Iraq if his own forces cannot produce a paper that can be called a 'win'?"" The translation is incomplete and confusing - it ends with ""produce a paper that can be called a 'win'"" which doesn't make logical sense and seems to cut off the intended meaning. The phrase about producing a paper is bizarre and not related to the military context. The model also assumes the surge has already failed, when the source poses it as a hypothetical.

比尔·盖茨认为，要减小不平等性、抵消自动化的替代效应所造成的社会成本，就必须对Nexus征收所得税，或对卢克征收用机器人替换肯的重税。	Bill Gates thinks that, to ease the inequality and offset the social costs implied by automation’s displacement effects, either Nexus should pay income tax, or Luke should pay a hefty tax for replacing Ken with a robot.	According to Bill Gates, reducing inequality and offsetting the social costs of automation will require a tax on the Nexus, or a heavy tax on robots to replace human laborers like Luke.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""According to Bill Gates, reducing inequality and offsetting the social costs of automation will require a tax on the Nexus, or a heavy tax on robots to replace human laborers like Luke."" The model says ""a heavy tax on robots to replace human laborers like Luke,"" which makes it sound like robots should be taxed in order to replace human laborers. The source means Luke should be taxed for replacing Ken with a robot - the tax is on the act of replacement, not on robots themselves. The model also says ""human laborers like Luke"" when Luke is the one doing the replacing (employer), not the human laborer being replaced (Ken).

Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""But with NAFTA unresolved and new rules for trade and investment unwritten and unenforced, it is impossible to make investments and pursue economic recovery."" The model changes the temporal logic from ""will not be forthcoming until"" to ""is impossible,"" which misrepresents the conditional future relationship. The phrase ""unwritten and unenforced"" is redundant since unwritten rules cannot be enforced. The model also changes ""that"" (referring to investment and recovery) to a more general statement, losing the specific reference to what will not be forthcoming.

As a result, Pakistan’s judiciary, media, and many civil-society organizations are now committed not only to limiting the military, but also to stopping the looting that is taking place in the new political system.	Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""As a result, Pakistan's judiciary, media, and many civil-society organizations are now committed not only to limiting the military, but also to stopping the looting that is taking place in the new political system."" The model uses ""stopping the looting"" which is too literal and crude compared to ""constrain the political establishment's rapacious behavior.""

这一建议鼓励人口迅速老龄化的中国社会和能让中国的高储蓄和工业产能大显身手的世界过度消费、投资不足、提高失业率。	It encourages overconsumption, underinvestment, and rising unemployment in a rapidly aging society, and in a world that can make tremendous use of China’s high saving and industrial capacity.	Such a recommendation would encourage a rapidly aging Chinese society and a world of excessive consumption, insufficient investment, and rising unemployment.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Such a recommendation would encourage a rapidly aging Chinese society and a world of excessive consumption, insufficient investment, and rising unemployment."" The model reverses the logical relationship. The Chinese explains that the recommendation encourages negative behaviors (overconsumption, underinvestment, rising unemployment) in a context where China could instead help the world. The model makes it sound like the recommendation would encourage both Chinese society and a world that already has these problems, rather than encouraging these problems themselves. The correct translation should be ""It encourages overconsumption, underinvestment, and rising unemployment in a rapidly aging society, and in a world that can make tremendous use of China's high saving and industrial capacity."""

Similarly, the EU’s member governments should consider a “PrivilegedPartnership” as an alternative to full membership, with the clear intention of joining the negotiation framework as soon as possible not being an obstacle.	Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""Similarly, the EU's member governments should consider a 'PrivilegedPartnership' as an alternative to full membership, with the clear intention of joining the negotiation framework as soon as possible not being an obstacle."" The model has several grammatical issues. First, ""PrivilegedPartnership"" lacks a space. Second, the phrase ""with the clear intention of joining the negotiation framework as soon as possible not being an obstacle"" is grammatically awkward and unclear. The model also changes the meaning by suggesting this should be considered as a future possibility rather than describing what some governments reportedly intend to do.

Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""But opinion leaders in every country, as well as the relatives and friends of the blockers, are watching, and their influence can create an atmosphere that is uncomfortable for everyone."" The model translates the Chinese term for ""least informed"" as ""blockers,"" which is inaccurate and changes the meaning. The phrase ""uncomfortable for everyone"" is also vaguer than ""makes everyone less willing to spend,"" which specifically connects the atmosphere to spending behavior.

Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""The problem is that if they do, they will be ushering in a four-year term for the new chancellor, AngelaMerkel, whose commitment to the neoliberal project is almost as firm as mine."" The model has a spacing error in ""AngelaMerkel"" (should be ""Angela Merkel""). The phrase ""if they do, they will be ushering in"" is more wordy than ""the electorate will then get,"" and changes the conditional structure.

Given women’s lack of experience, their predominant role as caregivers, the unacceptability of their negotiating style, and the persistence of old stereotypes, it is not surprising that there are gender differences.	Fluency Error	"The model translation is ""Given women's lack of experience, their predominant role as caregivers, the unacceptability of their negotiating style, and the persistence of old stereotypes, it is not surprising that there are gender differences.""

Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""Reviewers praised Piketty's felicitous quotations from Balzac and Jane Austen; but, in fact, the reader encounters more economist jargon and statistical data than literary metaphor."" The phrase ""felicitous quotations"" is too formal and doesn't capture the intended meaning.

如果想在不加税的情况下增加公共部门投资的话，那么预算削减就必须避免其他方面的非可持续负债膨胀到难以置信的程度。	If public-sector investment were to be increased with no rise in taxation, the budget cuts required elsewhere to avoid unsustainable debt growth would bein implausibly large.	If public-sector investment is to be increased without raising taxes, budget cuts will have to avoid other forms of unsustainable deficit-financing to an extent that is simply unbelievable.	Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""If public-sector investment is to be increased without raising taxes, budget cuts will have to avoid other forms of unsustainable deficit-financing to an extent that is simply unbelievable."" The model misinterprets the core logic of the sentence. The original states that budget cuts would need to be ""implausibly large"" to avoid unsustainable debt growth, but the model says cuts must ""avoid other forms of unsustainable deficit-financing,"" which changes the meaning entirely. The phrase ""to an extent that is simply unbelievable"" also fails to capture ""implausibly large"" properly.

这种不可避免的宿命感远远胜过真正的反欧洲信念， 阻止英国改变其直到2016年还鲜有选民真正赞同的毫无意义且自我毁灭政策的可能结果。	This sense of inevitability, far more than genuine anti-European conviction, is what has discouraged Britain from changing its mind about a pointless and self-destructive policy that few voters cared about until 2016.

在通胀肆虐的20世纪七八十年代，当投资者对通胀风险溢价的要求推高长期借贷成本时，扩大赤字起到了刺激长期利率进一步走高的效果，而赤字降低抑制了长期利率。	In the inflation-plagued 1970s and 1980s, when investors’ demand for inflation-risk premia pushed up long-term borrowing costs, larger deficits tended to boost long-term interest rates further, while smaller deficits reduced them.

The phrase ""demanded a premium for inflation risk"" is less precise than ""demand for inflation-risk premia pushed up long-term borrowing costs"" - the original explains the mechanism (demand pushing up costs) rather than just stating what investors did. The model also changes ""smaller deficits reduced them"" to ""deficit reduction depressed long-run interest rates,"" which shifts from comparing deficit sizes to discussing deficit reduction as a policy. The word ""depressed"" also has different connotations than ""reduced.""

Fluency Error	"The model translation is ""But, as we slowly strangle the last vestiges of free journalistic opinion, and even as small-scale television channels provide uncensored information, we are tightening our grip on the teapot."" The phrase ""slowly strangle"" combined with ""even as small-scale television channels provide uncensored information"" creates logical confusion—it suggests that channels are providing information at the same time as being strangled. The target makes clear that even these small channels ""seem dangerous"" and thus face threat.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""All of this in Copenhagen exposes the fact that the EU is not only not a world power, but that it is not even an adequate international mediator."" The phrase ""all of this in Copenhagen"" is awkward and the model uses ""adequate"" which is much weaker than saying the EU ""even"" lacks qualification as ""a global arbiter.""

Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""Not long after Krugman's article was published, some Chinese economists began to classify the growth model that Deng Xiaoping's reforms introduced about three decades ago as 'rough and ready,' and thus problematic."" The model translates the technical term ""extensive"" as ""rough and ready,"" which is inappropriate for an economic context. ""Extensive growth"" is a specific economics term referring to growth achieved through increased input of resources rather than efficiency improvements, while ""rough and ready"" suggests something hastily done or improvised.

In the late 1980’s, there was a widespread belief in Japanese political circles that the era of American-dominated peace was over, and that a Japanese peace for the Asia-Pacific region was about to begin.	Named Entity Error	"The model translation is ""In the late 1980's, there was a widespread belief in Japanese political circles that the era of American-dominated peace was over, and that a Japanese peace for the Asia-Pacific region was about to begin."" The model changes ""Pax Americana"" and ""Pax Japonica"" - which are specific Latin terms meaning American peace and Japanese peace respectively - to English phrases ""American-dominated peace"" and ""Japanese peace for the Asia-Pacific region."" This loses the parallel structure and historical echo of ""Pax Romana"" (Roman peace) that these Latin terms deliberately invoke. The model also changes ""fashionable"" to ""widespread belief,"" which loses the sense that this was a trendy idea among certain policy circles.

批评者将这一“危机约束综合症 ” （ crisis straitjacket syndrome）视为一根筋通胀目标的主要问题。	Critics identify this “crisis straitjacket syndrome” as the main problem with single-minded inflation targeting.	Critics view this “crisis strait jacket” as the main problem with the inflation target.	Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""Critics view this 'crisis strait jacket' as the main problem with the inflation target."" The model uses ""strait jacket"" (the garment) when the source uses ""straitjacket syndrome,"" which in this context refers to being overly constrained. More importantly, the model says ""with the inflation target"" when the source says ""with single-minded inflation targeting"" - this removes the key criticism that the problem is being too focused or rigid about inflation targeting, not just having an inflation target. The word ""single-minded"" is crucial because it conveys excessive focus. The correct translation should be ""Critics identify this 'crisis straitjacket syndrome' as the main problem with single-minded inflation targeting."""

The model adds ""After more than a half-century of supporting"" which introduces a temporal element and external support not in the source. The source says these dreams and fervor ""animated"" (motivated/drove) Israel's combatants, not that they were supported for a long time. The model also loses the key contrast that these motivations ""are gone, replaced by"" pragmatism - the model just says pragmatism ""has emerged,"" which doesn't convey that the old motivations have disappeared.

Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""Although the IMF's pre-approval process is supposed to be secret, countries are wary of being seen as having potential economic problems if word leaks out that they have asked for pre- approval."" The model uses ""is supposed to be secret"" when the Chinese indicates countries are ""not confident"" about confidentiality, changing who controls the narrative. The structure ""if word leaks out that they have asked for pre-approval"" is grammatically awkward with the hyphen in ""pre- approval"" and creates redundancy. The model also changes ""signal potential economic problems"" to ""being seen as having potential economic problems,"" which shifts from active signaling to passive perception.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Perhaps capitalism's performance would have been better if its rules had been set, interpreted, judged, and enforced by believers, rather than by skeptics who limited its excesses."" This completely reverses the meaning of the Chinese text. The original argues that capitalism works better when skeptics restrain it, but the model suggests it would work better if believers controlled it.

The model also loses the nuance of the original phrase about investors flattering themselves with the belief in liquidity ""calms his nerves and makes him much more willing to run a risk,"" which has psychological subtlety. The model's version ""allows them to feel comfortable taking more audacious risks"" is less precise and loses the calming effect on nerves. The correct translation should be ""But he immediately drew back: the fact 'that each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is 'liquid' (though this cannot be true for all investors collectively) calms his nerves and makes him much more willing to run a risk...'"""

For example, China’s 12th Five-Year Plan, adopted in March 2001, committed the economy to a consumer-led era, based on the development of a urbanized and service-oriented sector.	Named Entity Error	"The model translation is ""For example, China's 12th Five-Year Plan, adopted in March 2001, committed the economy to a consumer-led era, based on the development of a urbanized and service-oriented sector."" The model gets the date completely wrong - it says ""March 2001"" when the original clearly states ""March 2011."" This is a ten-year error that places the policy in the wrong decade. The model also has a grammatical error with ""a urbanized"" instead of ""an urbanized"" or the original's construction about ""urbanization and the development of an embryonic services sector."" The phrase ""service-oriented sector"" is also less precise than the original's ""embryonic services sector,"" which emphasizes the sector is in early stages of development.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""The dream of changing the world disguises the farce, which affects not only individual fates, as in Cervantes' story, but also the misguided army of clowns who think they are missionaries."" The model misinterprets the comparison structure. The original says the farce affects not only a single life as in Cervantes' story, but also affects the army of buffoons. The model's phrasing ""affects not only individual fates...but also the misguided army"" incorrectly suggests the army is an additional victim of effects, rather than being another type of victim. The original emphasizes that unlike Cervantes where only one person was deluded, here an entire army is deluded.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""If you have a small problem with an Afghan or a Pakistani, you have to wait 12 months before you can talk to an official,"" a refugee told us."" The model completely misunderstands the context. The original is about asylum seekers who are Afghan or Pakistani nationals waiting to speak to immigration officials about their cases. The phrase ""a little ill"" refers to minor health issues that might require documentation or support. The model interprets this as having ""a small problem with an Afghan or a Pakistani,"" suggesting an interpersonal conflict, which makes no sense in the refugee context. This fundamentally changes what is being discussed from immigration processing delays to some kind of dispute resolution.

The model gets both the timeframe and the meaning backwards. The original says radicals ""prevailed through"" the use of scorn and derision - meaning they won by using these tactics against others. The model claims Johnson described the 1960s as a decade characterized by contempt and ridicule, and says radicals had their heyday then. This reverses the agency and changes what is being described. Johnson's quote is about the radicals' rhetorical tactics, not about describing an entire decade. The model also adds ""the 1960's"" which is not specified in the original. The correct translation should be ""Nevertheless, the radicals prevailed through what the economist Harry Johnson called 'scorn and derision.'"""

The phrase ""was left until the end of the meeting"" is awkward and unclear - it suggests the reshuffling itself was postponed, when the original means the suspense or revelation about it occurs at the end. The model also changes ""President Xi Jinping"" to just ""Xi,"" which is less formal. The construction ""was also a highly influential event"" at the end feels flat compared to the original's emphasis.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""These dramatic political reversals underscore the limitations of elections and the democratic deficiencies that plague many developing countries, including the Philippines' neighbors in the region."" The model misses a key point by using generic language about ""dramatic political reversals"" when the original specifically discusses Thaksin's experience as illustrating these problems. The phrase ""plague many developing countries"" is more negative than the original's ""now beset,"" which suggests current challenges rather than endemic plagues.

The original clearly states he oversaw ""China 2030"" which was a joint report produced by the World Bank and China's think tank, the Development Research Center.

Omission/Addition Error	"The model translation is ""The fledgling Republic of Korea (South Korea) was immediately sucked into the power politics of the Cold War, and prevented from joining the UN until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1₉91."" The model adds content not in the original - ""the fall of the Soviet Union"" - as an explanation for why South Korea could finally join the UN. The original simply states the goal ""not achieved until 1991"" without explaining what changed in 1991. The model's addition of the Soviet Union's fall is an interpretation or external knowledge, not translation. The phrase ""sucked into"" is also more colloquial than the original's ""became engulfed in."" The model also omits ""under UN auspices"" from the founding description.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Officials must work to ensure that what is communicated to committees is not just the results of formal analyses produced by funded institutions, but also a vision of the complex realities to which they are applied."" The model changes ""Great care is taken by officials"" to ""Officials must work,"" which shifts from describing current practice to prescribing what should happen. This changes the sentence from descriptive to normative. The phrase ""a vision of the complex realities to which they are applied"" is also awkward - the original's ""complex real-world conditions and perspectives"" is clearer and emphasizes the actual conditions, not a vision of them. The model also changes ""inform the Committee"" to ""communicated to committees"" (plural), which loses specificity. The correct translation should be ""Great care is taken by officials to inform the Committee not just of the results of formal analysis by the sponsoring bodies, but also of complex real-world conditions and perspectives."""

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""In any case, the message was heard in the United States, where Americans are accustomed to launching decisive, quick wars (the US military's approach since the Vietnam War) and making long-term sacrifices and struggles in wars of survival."" The model misinterprets the sentence structure and meaning. The original says the term was meant to communicate to Americans (who prefer quick wars) the need for long-term commitment. The model makes it sound like Americans do both quick wars and long-term commitments, which contradicts the point. The parenthetical ""(the US military's approach since the Vietnam War)"" is also misleading - the original says Americans have been ""insistent on"" quick wars since Vietnam, meaning they demand this approach, not that it's the military's approach. The phrase ""In any case, the message was heard"" also adds content suggesting the communication attempt was successful, which is not stated in the original.

Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""The euro's architects were well aware of this flaw, but they believed that the political will to go further would naturally emerge as demand did."" The phrase ""as demand did"" at the end is awkward and grammatically incomplete. The original uses ""when the need arose,"" which is a complete temporal clause referring to future needs. The model's ""as demand did"" uses ""did"" as a substitute verb, but it creates confusion about what demand is being referenced and uses past tense inappropriately. The model also changes ""when the need arose"" to ""as demand did,"" which shifts the meaning from a conditional future situation to something that seems to have already occurred. The construction ""would naturally emerge"" is acceptable but ""could be summoned"" in the original is more active and suggests deliberate political action rather than natural emergence.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""But now a disturbing movement has arisen in the West to tell those who still enjoy the myriad benefits that electricity brings that they should be content with the status quo."" The model completely reverses who is being told what. The original says the movement wants to tell the 1.1 billion people ""who still lack these myriad benefits that they should go without"" - meaning telling people without electricity to stay without it. The model changes this to telling people ""who still enjoy the myriad benefits"" to be content, which is the opposite group. The model is talking about telling people who have electricity to accept things as they are, when the original is about telling people without electricity not to seek it. This is a fundamental misreading that inverts the ethical criticism being made.

The phrase ""return to the fold"" misrepresents the temporal logic - the source says they ""will do so again"" (meaning return to Sunni rule), but ""return to the fold"" suggests they left something, which isn't the intended meaning.

Incomplete Translation	"The model translation is ""So Morsi's 'auto-c coup' was an openly stated goal of the revolution – a democratic imperative, or not?"" The model has a typo with ""auto-c coup"" instead of ""auto-coup."" More critically, it completely restructures the meaning - the source asks whether the auto-coup was necessary to realize democratic goals, but the model changes this to asking whether the auto-coup itself was a democratic goal.

The model completely misunderstands the comparison structure. The source compares the rapprochement with Suu Kyi to how South African rulers dealt with Mandela, but the model makes it sound like someone should deal with both Thein Sein and Suu Kyi the way apartheid rulers dealt with Mandela, which doesn't make sense given Suu Kyi's role. The model also changes ""iconic"" to just using her name, and loses the phrase ""core decision"" which explains the importance.

Grammatical Error	"The model translation is ""This may be a warning that India's freedom of speech is in peril, and that angry mobs are threatening to intimidate the government into inaction, which can be felt in the chilling atmosphere of impunity that prevails in the country."" The model reverses the relationship - the source says the atmosphere of intimidation is palpable (clearly feelable), and governments surrender to mobs. But the model says mobs threaten to intimidate government into inaction, which doesn't capture that governments are already surrendering. The phrase ""chilling atmosphere of impunity"" adds ""impunity"" which isn't in the source. The model also changes ""While it may seem alarmist to suggest"" to ""This may be a warning that,"" losing the acknowledgment that the claim might sound extreme. The phrase ""angry mobs"" simplifies ""inflamed mobs."" The correct translation should be ""While it may seem alarmist to suggest that freedom of expression in India is in peril, the atmosphere of intimidation by inflamed mobs, to whom governments surrender all too willingly, is palpable."""

The model changes ""Addicted to an open-ended strain of über monetary accommodation"" to ""having become addicted to ultra-loose monetary policy,"" which is simpler but loses the nuance of ""open-ended strain"" and the specific term ""über."" The model also restructures the sentence, putting the addiction first rather than leading with the current state.

The phrase ""may be tempting"" is weaker than ""might be tempting,"" though both are acceptable. The model also changes ""potentially even secure"" to ""even lead to,"" which is less emphatic.

The model completely reverses the meaning by saying people's ""sober calculation"" is susceptible to emotion, when the source says people are ""more easily swayed by emotions"" than by ""cool calculus."" The model makes rationality the weak point, when the source says emotion is the dominant force. The phrase ""more sober calculation"" contradicts the point that most people aren't calculating soberly.

Simply put, emerging economies can benefit from faster US growth in the medium term, but short-term risks are being overwhelmed by a “capital tsunami” (to use Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s phrase) in the meantime.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Simply put, emerging economies can benefit from faster US growth in the medium term, but short-term risks are being overwhelmed by a 'capital tsunami' (to use Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's phrase) in the meantime."" The model completely reverses the relationship by saying ""short-term risks are being overwhelmed by a 'capital tsunami'"" when the original means the medium-term benefits are being swamped by the short-term risks caused by the capital tsunami.

The model adds ""and it was hard to have so many choices every day"" as explanation, which changes the tone from a factual observation to more of a complaint. The original simply states the facts about starting to feel a headache and unconsciously wanting to return, letting the reader draw conclusions.

Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""Countries that have good reason to fear a Russian gas cutoff have loudly protested that the pipeline's political aims far outweigh its economic merits."" The phrase ""gas cutoff"" changes the meaning from ""manufactured chill,"" which is a metaphor for deliberately created tension or supply disruptions, to just a cutoff. The model also changes ""politically rather than economically motivated"" to ""political aims far outweigh its economic merits,"" which subtly shifts the argument. The original suggests the pipeline lacks economic justification, while the model acknowledges economic merits but says political aims are greater. The correct translation should be ""Countries that have good reason to fear a Russian manufactured chill have loudly proclaimed that Nord Stream is politically rather than economically motivated."""

Using biomarkers, clinical trials designed by pharmaceutical companies can show a high degree of “relative therapeutic superiority” between the test drug and the comparator (usually an ineffective placebo, but sometimes another therapy).	Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""Using biomarkers, clinical trials designed by pharmaceutical companies can show a high degree of 'relative therapeutic superiority' between the test drug and the comparator (usually an ineffective placebo, but sometimes another therapy)."" The phrase ""relative therapeutic superiority"" is not a standard term and sounds awkward compared to ""relative treatment difference,"" which is more neutral and commonly used in clinical research. The model also changes ""show a high 'relative treatment difference'"" to ""show a high degree of,"" adding unnecessary words. The phrase ""ineffective placebo"" is also odd since placebos are by definition inactive, not ineffective.

Fluency Error	"The model translation is ""But, by repeatedly betting on an Asset Economy and keeping its policy interest rate at zero, the Fed has run out of traditional tools."" The phrase ""repeatedly betting on an Asset Economy"" is awkward compared to ""repeatedly upped the ante in providing support to the Asset Economy,"" which uses a gambling metaphor more effectively. The model also simplifies the causation by saying the Fed ran out of tools because it kept rates at zero, when the original emphasizes the pattern of repeatedly increasing support led to exhausting ammunition. The structure is less effective at conveying the escalating commitment.

More importantly, the model incorrectly places Moldova in Asia when it's actually in Europe, creating geographic confusion.

The phrase ""which quickly spread to the rest of the world as well"" misses the point that liberalization itself didn't spread quickly, but rather America's problems spread quickly after liberalization. The original emphasizes that liberalization enabled rapid contagion of problems, not that liberalization itself spread.

政策的制订不能幻想着优质信贷的出现上，只有当人们信心回来的时候，金融市场的领袖和监管者的作用才会重新发挥出效果。	Policies must not be based on the fiction that good loans were made, and that the business acumen of financial-market leaders and regulators will be validated once confidence is restored.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Policymakers cannot pretend that good credit is around the corner, and financial markets' leaders and regulators will have to step up their game only when confidence returns."" The model fundamentally misunderstands the argument. The original says policies must not be based on the fiction that good loans were already made - it's about the past, not the future. The phrase ""good credit is around the corner"" suggests waiting for future improvement, which contradicts the original meaning. The model also changed the sense by saying leaders and regulators will act ""only when confidence returns,"" implying they should wait, when the original says their role will be validated only after confidence returns - a different point about accountability. The correct translation should be ""Policies must not be based on the fiction that good loans were made, and that the business acumen of financial-market leaders and regulators will be validated once confidence is restored."""

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""In the working groups, both organizations used a lot of demonstrative statements, invited 'outsiders' as well as experts, cooperated with relevant associations and institutions, and prepared the ground for classification."" The model misunderstands ""diverse representation on their working committees"" as ""used a lot of demonstrative statements,"" which completely changes the meaning from having diverse membership to using rhetorical techniques. The phrase ""prepared the ground for classification"" suggests preliminary work, while ""preparing their classification revisions"" indicates they actually developed the classifications. The model also changed ""collaborated"" to ""cooperated,"" which is less formal, and ""invited input from"" to ""invited,"" which loses the nuance about seeking opinions rather than just including people.

The phrasing is awkward and confusing. The model says ""citizens in general, like citizens in democracies,"" which suggests these are different groups when they should be the same. The phrase ""if only because they can tolerate the winner"" changes the logic - the original draws a parallel between tolerating the elected government and accepting economic solidarity, but the model makes tolerance seem like a minimal reason.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Without fundamental reforms to its economic-development model, it is hard to see how China can become a mature creditor-debtor country."" The model fundamentally misunderstands the economic concept. The original discusses China's progression from ""immature creditor-lender"" to ""mature creditor-lender"" - both stages of being a creditor nation.

不过，总体来说，中国经济的增长速度还是超过人们的想象，中国的出口也远远大于世界上其他国家所能承受的进口，这也是大多数国家不能忍受的。	It was becoming increasingly clear that as China continued to grow faster than almost anyone else, the rest of the world’s import capacity (and tolerance) could not keep up with China’s export machine.	But, overall, China’s growth has been faster than most people expected, and its exports are far larger than the rest of the world can afford to import, which is what most countries can’t stand to see.	Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""But, overall, China's growth has been faster than most people expected, and its exports are far larger than the rest of the world can afford to import, which is what most countries can't stand to see."" The model fundamentally misrepresents the economic argument. The original says it was becoming clear that as China grew, the world's import capacity couldn't keep up - this is about structural imbalance. The model instead says ""most countries can't stand to see"" this, making it sound like jealousy or political resentment rather than economic capacity constraints. The phrase ""can afford to import"" also misses the point - it's not about affordability but about absorption capacity and tolerance for trade imbalances. The model loses the forward-looking ""becoming increasingly clear"" and ""could not keep up,"" which convey the emerging nature of this problem.

The model also restructured to make it sound like the Global Fund and Vaccine Alliance are examples of ""women's and girls' empowerment and innovation initiatives,"" when actually these are separate categories of things needing support.

The phrase ""There is one thing to be said for the last two years"" is awkward - ""Much to his credit"" is more natural and complimentary. The model changed ""from his first day in office"" to ""from the outset,"" which is less specific and vivid. The model also changed ""work towards a resolution"" to ""find a solution,"" which is subtly different - working toward suggests ongoing effort and process, while finding suggests discovering something that already exists.

More importantly, the model restructures the sentence awkwardly - it makes the financial products the subject supporting borrowing, when the original says borrowing is supported by easing standards and new products. The phrase ""which in turn could then be re-packaged and re-used as collateral"" is confusing - it's unclear whether ""which"" refers to borrowing or assets.

Named Entity Error	"The model translation is ""Zhou Enlai, an elder statesman of the planned economy, once warned China's reformers that they were creating a 'cage economy,' in which capitalist birds would grow in a socialist cage."" The model completely changed the person from Chen Yuan to Zhou Enlai - these are different historical figures. Zhou Enlai was a premier who died in 1976, while Chen Yuan was involved in later reform debates.

Semantic Error	"The model translation is ""Indeed, Lee, the father, never left politics, first as a 'wise man' and then as a mentor, and his competence was amply demonstrated in a variety of high-profile positions."" The model says Lee's competence was demonstrated, but the source is about Lee Kuan Yew making his son prove his abilities openly. The sentence structure confuses whose abilities are being proven. The model also changed ""Senior Minister"" (an actual title) to ""wise man"" which is less precise, and added ""his competence was amply demonstrated"" which shifts focus from the son proving himself to the father's competence.

While such measures may be unpopular in the future, the BNP Paribas case emerged at a time when policymakers were grappling with how to implement effective sanctions – and one can only speculate that prosecutors were thinking along the same lines.	Fluency Error	"The model translation is ""While such measures may be unpopular in the future, the BNP Paribas case emerged at a time when policymakers were grappling with how to implement effective sanctions – and one can only speculate that prosecutors were thinking along the same lines."" The phrase ""While such measures may be unpopular"" is awkward because it suggests opposition to the measures, but the source talks about potential ""financial backlash"" which is a different concern. The model also changed ""induce a financial backlash"" to ""be unpopular"" which weakens the economic impact. The phrase ""one suspects"" became ""one can only speculate"" which sounds more uncertain than the original.

Lexical Error	"The model translation is ""As the head of the United Kingdom's financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority, I believed that lawyers could only do, not direct."" The phrase ""could only do, not direct"" is confusing and unclear. The source uses the idiomatic expression ""on tap, not on top"" which means lawyers should be available for advice but not in charge of decision-making. The model's version ""could only do, not direct"" loses this clear meaning and sounds like lawyers lack the ability to direct rather than that they shouldn't be in charge.

The model also adds ""in the north of the country"" which unnecessarily specifies the Rust Belt's location - this is common knowledge and wasn't in the source.

但是，如果如（据说是）马克·吐温所观察到的，历史总是重复而不是复制自己，那么过去的记忆应该指引而不是绑架东欧。	But if, as Mark Twain supposedly observed, history rhymes rather than repeating itself, the memory of the past should guide Eastern Europe, not take it hostage.

The model changed ""rhymes rather than repeating itself"" to ""repeats itself, but never in the same way."" The famous Twain quote is about history rhyming, not repeating - the whole point is that history doesn't repeat but creates similar patterns (rhymes). By saying history ""repeats...but never in the same way,"" the model creates a logical contradiction. The model also changed ""take it hostage"" to ""imprison"" which, while similar, loses the violent imagery of being held hostage.

The model adds ""indefinitely"" which changes the temporal framing. The word ""distribution"" makes no sense here - the reference says ""allotted two years"" for negotiations, not for distribution. The phrase ""for the long term"" is changed to ""indefinitely,"" which is more absolute. The correct translation should be ""It certainly cannot afford to lose them for the long term, as would probably occur if no deal were reached within the allotted two years."""
如果我们使用了来自某贫困国家的原材料所制成的产品，却没有合理的程序来为该国的人民造福，那么我们与盗贼又有何区别？	If we use goods made from raw materials that are obtained from a poor country without the proceeds being used to benefit the people of that country, we become complicit in a particularly iniquitous form of grand larceny.

The model completely changes the structure and meaning. The reference states ""we become complicit in...grand larceny"" (we become thieves), but the model asks ""what is the difference between us and a thief?"" which weakens the accusation. The phrase ""particularly iniquitous form of grand larceny"" is reduced to just ""a thief,"" losing the legal and moral specificity. The model also changes ""without the proceeds being used to benefit"" to ""does not benefit,"" which loses the emphasis on proceeds/profits.
