比如，通过他的民间资源养护队（Civilian Conservation Corps ） ， 年轻人被动员起来拓荒植树。	With his Civilian Conservation Corps, for example, young men were enlisted to clean up the wilderness and plant trees.
如果中国想要避免可怕的“中等收入陷阱 ” — —大部分高速增长发展中经济体在收入达到与今天的中国相当的阈值水平时都曾经历过这一陷阱 — — 就必须取得成功。	Success is essential if China is to avoid the dreaded “middle-income trap” – the economic slowdown that most fast-growing developing economies experience when they reach income thresholds comparable to that of China today.
为了解风险究竟在哪里，就要去理解“弱人工智能 ” （ narrow AI）和“通用人工智能 ” （ Artificial General Intelligence）之间的区别。	To understand what is at stake, consider the distinction between “narrow AI” and “artificial general intelligence” (AGI).
大多数会采用更加先进的税收制度，例如为降低低收入劳动者的有效边际税率 — — 就是美国总统奥巴马所提出的 “让工作真正挣钱 ” 。	Most would make the tax system more progressive, by, for example, lowering the effective marginal tax rate for low-income workers – what US President Barack Obama has called “making work pay.”
总统奥巴马关于美国情报搜集行动改革的演讲以及随后参与的德国电视访问算得上重新争取美国盟友信任的第一批动作。	President Barack Obama’s speech about reforms of US intelligence-gathering activities, as well as his subsequent interview on German television, represented a first attempt to regain the confidence of America’s allies.
对于如何处理类似美国日益脆弱的贸易赤字或者新兴经济体中的金融运转不良等引人注目的问题，各国莫衷一是。	There is simply no agreement on how to address glaring problems such as America’s increasingly fragile trade deficit, or financial dysfunction in a number of emerging markets.
今年，俄罗斯、亚美尼亚、白俄罗斯、哈萨克斯坦和吉尔吉斯斯坦共同加入了欧亚经济联盟（Eurasian Economic Union，EEU ） 。 EEU是一个关税联盟，也带有防御性质。	This year Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan have joined together in a Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), a customs union with a defense component.
理解20世纪60年代末到80年代初的大通胀如何是解决的能为解决重大经济问题提供重要教训（不管我们现在所处的时代已有了多大的不同 ） ， 也能为未来所面临的的危险提供洞见。	Understanding how the Great Inflation from the late 1960’s to the early 1980’s was tamed offers important lessons for addressing far-reaching economic problems, however different ours may be, and provides insight into the dangers that may lie ahead.
根据这一观点，不平等的财富分布会产生凯恩斯所谓的“食利者的安乐死，并由此导致资本家用于榨取资本的稀缺价值的累计压迫力的安乐死 。 ”	Unequal wealth distribution, in this view, produces what Keynes called “the euthanasia of the rentier, and, consequently, the euthanasia of the cumulative oppressive power of the capitalist to exploit the scarcity-value of capital.”
一个最显著的上涨发生在1922年，当共和党控制的政府通过了福德尼-麦坎伯关税协定，将平均进口关税率提高了64 % 。	One of the most notable hikes occurred in 1922, when the Republican-controlled government passed the Fordney-McCumber Tariff, which raised the average import tariff rate by 64%.
在2001年9月的恐怖袭击发生4年后，美国声称已经花费了成百上千亿美元做好了再一次应急的准备，但这场灾难向世界表明：美国根本没有真的准备好¾这个国家甚至无力应对一场事先已经发出了足够预警的灾难。	Four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, and with billions of dollars allegedly spent on “preparedness” for another emergency, America has shown the world that it was not prepared – even for an event that came with ample warning.
当然，真正不怀好意的人会直截了当地指出：俄国加入一个由美、德、日、英、法、意、加等世界经济巨头组成的俱乐部，这一事实本身就非常可笑。	Of course, people who really want to be unkind will point out the absurdity of Russia’s membership in a club that includes the giant economies of US, Germany, Japan, England, France, Italy, and (less so) Canada.
虽然我们作为前任全球海洋委员曾在2014年竭力争取让海洋拥有其自身的全球专属目标，但现在已经很难相信海洋在可持续发展目标中的地位曾经受到过质疑。	While we, as previous global ocean commissioners, had to campaign hard in 2014 for the ocean to have its own dedicated global goal, it is now hard to believe that the ocean’s position in the SDGs was ever in question.
问题是，他们一旦这样做了又会迎来新总理安吉拉·默克尔（Angela Merkel）四年的任期。 而她对新自由主义项目的承诺几乎和我一样坚定。	The problem is that the electorate will then get four years of rule by a chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose commitment to the neo-liberal project is almost as strong as mine.
特别提款权是在40多年前开始使用，当时主要为了应对外汇储备币种的不足，这同时也是IMF改革计划的一部分，为的是将SDR作为全球主要的外汇储备币种。	The SDR was introduced 40 years ago to supplement what was then seen as an inadequate level of global reserves, and was subsequently enshrined in the IMF’s amended Articles of Agreement as the future principal reserve asset.
这两个计划的目标是创造2,500万个新工作岗位和提振增长。 这与维持福利的承诺一道，意味着现代形式的凯恩斯主义财政政策（当然不会这样起名 ） 。	This, together with a pledge to maintain welfare entitlements, amounts to a modern form of Keynesian fiscal policy (though of course not identified as such).
比如，存款担保机制完全看不到进展迹象，而关于单一清算基金，以及因为它无法获得公共支持，故而不能解决大规模银行灾难的争论也是众说纷纭。	The deposit-guarantee scheme, for example, shows no sign of progress, and the debates on the single resolution fund and its lack of a public backstop to deal with large-scale banking distress are going nowhere.
如今，这一势力斗争的关键冲突是叙利亚内战，中东地区的主要大国都直接或间接地牵涉其中，因为这是一场事关地区领导权归属的战斗。	Today, the key confrontation in this power struggle is Syria’s civil war, where all of the region’s major players are represented either directly or indirectly, because that is where the battle for regional hegemony will largely be decided.
现代全球化时代之前，工会可以通过在全国范围内组织而发展壮大，从而在对雇主和消费者上给了它们巨大的讨价还价的实力。	Before the modern globalization era, unions could thrive by organizing on a national scale, giving them enormous bargaining power vis-à-vis both employers and consumers.
实际上，尽管阿拉伯之春结束了让穆斯林世界许多独裁统治者保持执政的腐败旧交易，扎尔达里及其助手似乎并没有收到消息。	Indeed, while the Arab Spring ended the old corrupt bargain that kept so many autocratic rulers in power across the Muslim world, Zardari and his associates appear not to have received the message.
但因为继续加深经济主权一体化是解决欧元区困境的唯一长期方案，所以这样的改革不会很快达到目标。 欧洲央行的作用也因此变得极为关键。	But, while greater merging of economic sovereignty is the only long-term solution to the eurozone’s woes, such reforms cannot happen very quickly, which is why the ECB’s role is so crucial.
我们的分析显示不仅存在使金融市场高度波动的特有或自然力量；也意识到在面临金融崩溃之际必须拿出迅速有效的干涉手段。	Our analysis indicates that not only are there endemic and natural forces that make the financial system highly volatile; but also that swift, effective intervention is needed in the face of financial collapse.
虽然乌克兰的经济社会问题重重，人们仍然不应忘记，那场革命拯救了乌克兰，使它摆脱了俄罗斯式的“听指挥”的民主，直到今天。	Although Ukraine is in big economic and social trouble, it should not be forgotten that it has, until today, been saved from the fate of becoming a “guided” democracy in the Russian mold.
根据古希腊历史学家修昔底德（Thucydides）的说法，在伯罗奔尼撒战争期间“是雅典的崛起以及这一崛起令斯巴达产生的恐惧使得战争变得无法避免 。 ”	During the Peloponnesian War, according to the Greek historian Thucydides, “It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.”
但尽管土耳其关于库尔德抵抗的担忧并非毫无依据，但库尔德人实际建国的希望依然非常渺茫，因为这样一个库尔德国家将处在伊朗、伊拉克、土耳其和叙利亚等强烈反对库尔德人建国的四个国家的夹击之下。	But, while Turkey’s concerns about Kurdish resistance are not unfounded, the chances of actual Kurdish statehood remain slim, because such a state would be wedged between four countries – Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria – that bitterly oppose it.
美国在中东的多场战争 — — 阿富汗、伊拉克、叙利亚、利比亚，等等 — — 是为了让苏联以及随后的俄罗斯退出竞争，让美国独树霸权。	The multiple US wars in the Middle East – Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and others – have sought to remove the Soviet Union, and then Russia, from the scene and to give the US hegemonic sway.
就像在美国一样，势在必行的任务并不是感叹民众的威权主义倾向，而是要解决导致民粹主义成功的结构性问题。	As in the US, the imperative is not to lament people’s authoritarian tendencies, but to tackle the structural problems that have enabled populists to do well.
实际上，完成经济增长、社会凝聚和政治自由等高难度任务的新模型可能会在抓住了全球化外衣的某些国家中最先显现。	In fact, new models to square the circle of economic growth, social cohesion, and political liberty may be emerging in some of the countries that have grasped the mantle of globalization.
事实上，对许多国际行动方来说，西方的宽容和政治正确概念 — — 比如接受同性恋等“非传统生活方式 ” — —用普京的话说，是对“神赐多样性”的侮辱。	Indeed, for many international actors, Western notions of tolerance and political correctness – for example, acceptance of “non-traditional lifestyles,” such as homosexuality – are, in Putin’s words, an affront to the world’s “God-given diversity.”
虽然唱反调者比比皆是，但我们没有必要去担心这些言论，因为在当前动荡的全球经济形势下，中国有着其他国家并不具备的优势：一个清晰的前进路径。	Naysayers abound, but never mind them. China has an advantage that other countries in today’s troubled global economy lack: a clear path forward.
第三，我们把引导市场和鼓励信心作为货币政策的目标，从而使对通货膨胀的预期与我们对价格稳定的判断互相适应，进而起到稳定经济的作用。	Third, we aimed at guiding markets and inspiring confidence in monetary policy, thereby helping to stabilize the economy by keeping inflation expectations anchored at levels compatible with our definition of price stability.
去年，沙特国王阿卜杜拉由于担心什叶派的扩张而在其国家安全委员会首领班达尔本亲王的劝说下与以色列协调政策，来钳制伊朗日益增加的影响力。	Last year, Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, worried by Shi’a expansionism, was persuaded by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the head of his National Security Council, to coordinate policy with Israel to counter Iran’s growing influence.
而债券市场的自满所造成的畸低的长期利率将为全球金融市场提供安全网 — — 至少在自满变得不可持续之前是如此。	And the bizarrely low long-term interest rates set by complacent bond markets will provide a safety net for global financial markets – at least until complacency proves to be unsustainable.
伦敦-今天，虽然我们并没有看到资本主义有任何合乎逻辑的替代者，然而反市场的情绪还是非常盛行，比如说反映在对全球化在道义上的强烈反对。	LONDON -- Today, there seems to be no coherent alternative to capitalism, yet anti-market feelings are alive and well, expressed for example in the moralistic backlash against globalization.
两个月后，厄瓜多尔舒阿尔族领导人何塞·伊西德罗·安通在前往抗议威胁当地人家园的一个采矿项目时被折磨和杀害。	Two months later, José Isidro Tendetza Antún, a leader of the Shuar people in Ecuador, was tortured and killed while headed to a protest against a mining project that threatened his people’s homeland.
正如《德国商报》的Norbert Häring 最近指出的那样，此举可能把跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系变成债务责任共有化的工具。	Such a move, as Handelsblatt’s Norbert Häring recently pointed out, would transform the TTIP into a mechanism for mutualizing liability within the EU.
美国新任驻伊拉克军事指挥官欧迪埃诺中将说，新的行动将对逊尼派和什叶派更加一视同仁，而且美国士兵将与伊拉克士兵共同驻扎在已经清理的地区。	The new American operational commander in Iraq, Lt. General Raymond Odierno, says that the new efforts will be more evenhanded among Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods, and American troops will stay alongside Iraqi troops in areas that have been cleared.
联合国妇女署最近借助在突尼斯的政治学院项目对女性候选人进行了地方治理、市政委员会的使命和角色以及媒体关系方面的培训。	UN Women’s recent Political Academy in Tunisia trained women candidates on local governance, the missions and roles of municipal councils, and media relations.
据一项研究，1965至2004年间，种植高质量种子的发展中国家农民能够减少近3,000万公顷耕地 — — 相当于意大利大小的面积。	According to one study, between 1965 and 2004, farmers in developing countries who planted high-quality seeds were able to reduce farmland by almost 30 million hectares – an area roughly the size of Italy.
米兰 — — 大约十年前 ， （ 我所领导的）增长和发展委员会发布了一份报告，尝试着将二十年来各国的研究和发展经验提炼为发展中经济体能够参考的经验教训。	MILAN – About a decade ago, the Commission on Growth and Development (which I chaired) published a report that attempted to distill 20 years of research and experience in a wide range of countries into lessons for developing economies.
与此同时 ， 《 彭博新能源财经》的一项研究结果显示可再生能源吸引的投资正在创下纪录 — — 去年的总投资额达3293亿美元。	Meanwhile, renewable energy sources are receiving record amounts of investment – some $329.3 billion last year, according to research from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
二战结束后，特别是1957年苏联发射人造卫星以来，美国在电子工程及随后的计算机科学进行了巨大的投资。	Following World War II, and especially after the Soviet Union’s launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957, the US made massive investments in electrical engineering and, later, computer science.
但一个受过27年教育的新入职的神经外科医生可能必须读完厚厚的使用手册、上完乏味的培训课程，并接受“一日三变大师 ” （ change champion）的定期辅导才能驾驭使用医院IT系统的众多步骤。	But a newly hired neurosurgeon with 27 years of education may have to read a thick user manual, attend tedious classes, and accept periodic tutoring from a “change champion” to master the various steps required to use his hospital’s IT system.
在1984年的著作《霸权之后 》 （ After Hegemony）中，美国学者罗伯特·基欧汉（Robert Keohane）指出，即使没有美国的全球主宰力，国际合作也有可能得到保持。	In his 1984 book After Hegemony, the American scholar Robert Keohane argued that international cooperation could continue, even without US global dominance.
在Facebook、推特和谷歌等网站上追求点击率的必要性制约了传统媒体所有者履行确保问责这一传统责任上的能力。	The need to chase clicks on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Google eroded the ability of legacy media owners to perform their traditional role in ensuring accountability.
但是，这个防御态势由于泛阿拉伯世界的感觉而注定是不稳定的。 今天，普通的沙特公民粘在半岛电视台和其他阿拉伯与卫星电视网络上来跟踪加沙地带和南黎巴嫩的局势。	But such a defensive posture is bound to be unstable, due to pan-Arab feelings. Today, ordinary Saudi citizens are glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite TV networks to follow events in Gaza and south Lebanon.
显示美国经济处于危险境地的迹象到处可见 — — 从巨大的财政以及经常账户赤字缺口到快速下降的房价和弱势美元的价格。	Signs of the American economy’s perilous condition are everywhere – from yawning fiscal and current-account deficits to plummeting home prices and a feeble dollar.
事实上，我强烈质疑，如果你对投资者做一番调查就会发现，货币政策赫然居于全球低长期利率原因清单的榜首而非无人提及。	In fact, I strongly suspect that if one polled investors, monetary policy would be at the top of the list, not absent from it, as an explanation of low global long-term interest rates.
新德里—多年来，中国一直在寻求用“珍珠链”包围南亚。 所谓“珍珠链”是指连接中国东部沿海到中东的港口网络，这条链能增强其战略实力和海上航线。	"NEW DELHI – For years, China has sought to encircle South Asia with a “string of pearls"": a network of ports connecting its eastern coast to the Middle East that would boost its strategic clout and maritime access."
5月，希腊塞浦路斯领导人和土耳其塞浦路斯领导人重新开始谈判，如今，土耳其有机会迈出实现塞浦路斯岛统一的决定性步骤。	With Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders having resumed talks in May, Turkey now has the opportunity to take decisive steps toward uniting the island.
他们希望通过抑制市场势力，金融化和全球化的过度行为以及加强工人的议价能力来营造一个更具活力，竞争力和市场公平的经济。	And they seek a more dynamic, competitive, and fair-market economy by curbing the excesses of market power, financialization, and globalization, and by strengthening workers’ bargaining power.
美联储从2014年开始逐渐退出其资产购买计划（即量化宽松，简称QE ） ， 从2015年年底开始了利率正常化进程。	The US Federal Reserve started phasing out its asset-purchase program (quantitative easing, or QE) in 2014, and began normalizing interest rates in late 2015.
意识到这一点的美国人不吝于指责国会 — — 国会似乎更热衷于制造问题，而不是让经济实现其可观的潜力。	Recognizing this, Americans are not hesitant to blame a Congress that seems more eager to manufacture problems than to enable the economy to reach its considerable potential.
永远不能忘记，特朗普的政坛之路起步于散播种族主义“出身论”观点，说时任总统奥巴马并非出生在美国，因此没有资格竞选总统。	It should never be forgotten that Trump wormed his way into US politics by promoting the racist “birther” argument, which claimed that then-President Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore did not qualify for the office he held.
这一逐渐的转变与哈马斯对阿巴斯联合国外交手段的支持一起，表明如今哈马斯认为对以色列取得军事胜利希望渺茫。	This gradual shift, combined with Hamas’s endorsement of Abbas’s diplomatic approach in the UN, suggests that Hamas now believes that a military victory over Israel is not possible.
这股浪潮随后蔓延到位处中东心脏地带的埃及，胡斯尼·穆巴拉克30年统治的垮台使所有的震惊都转化成了确信。	After the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak’s 30 year-old regime in Egypt, the heartland of the Middle East, amazement has turned into certainty.
如果巴勒斯坦，在以色列的占领下，还能选择他们自己的领袖，为什么开罗、大马士革、利雅特或者阿尔及尔就不可以呢？	If the Palestinians, under Israeli occupation, can choose their own leaders, why can't the same happen in Cairo or Damascus, in Ryadh or Algiers?
相反，他将从毛泽东的错误中汲取教训，带领中国扎扎实实地迈进历史的下一个阶段，并牢牢地掌管好他珍视的政治遗产。	Instead, he will learn from Mao’s mistakes, so that he can lead China effectively into the next phase of its history – and secure the legacy that he so prizes.
不幸地是，中国的宣传者 — — 还同时兼任审查者 — — 拥有一种抹黑任何他们想要打造的招牌的怪异能力。	Unfortunately, China propagandists, who double as censors, have a perverse ability to discredit anything that they try to brand.
而像欧盟这样的机构 — — 即旨在通过一体化整合来确保秩序和稳定性 — — 就算不会遭到蔑视，也会被丢在角落。	And institutions like the EU – which aims to ensure order and stability through integration – are treated with indifference, if not disdain.
现在，随着制药公司越来越频繁地试图针对特定种族群体研发药物，一直为人们所避讳的种族遗传学问题再度被人们提起。	Now, with drug companies increasingly seeking to develop medications that target particular racial groups, the long-taboo subject of racial genetics has reemerged.
其伊斯兰日程把关键的国家机构 — — 即军队和司法系统 — — 推向了边缘化，也与反对者的自由主义和现代化要求相悖。	Its Islamist agenda put crucial state institutions – namely, the army and the judiciary – on edge and clashed with the liberal, modernizing demands of its opponents.
未来五年，全球投资者将面临新兴市场水深难测的局面，他们应该记住，对这些经济体来说，工业化和城市化浪潮以及随之而来的生产率提高还远未结束。	As global investors navigate the uncertain waters of emerging markets in the next few years, they should remember that, for these economies, the wave of industrialization and urbanization and the associated productivity gains are far from over.
另一个常见的反对烟草控制的论点是，如果人们并没有危害他人，各国政府就不应该干预他们的个人决定。 这一论点有悖常理并且与事实证据不符。	Another common argument against tobacco control – that if people are not harming others, governments should not interfere with their individual decisions – is at odds with both common sense and the evidence.
这种设计不仅仅是来自于开明的原则，同时也有其必要性：美国需要劝说人们跨越大洋来忍受前线战事以及后来工业化的艰难困苦。	This design was crafted not only from enlightened principle but from necessity: America needed to persuade people to cross the ocean and endure the hardships of the frontier and, later, industrialization.
回到2015年，当时我提出进行真正的债务重组，将债务规模和偿还率分别与希腊名义GDP及其增长率挂钩。	Back in 2015, I was pushing for substantive debt restructuring by means of linking the volume of debt and the rate of repayment to the size of Greece’s nominal GDP and its rate of growth, respectively.
当然，这些数字偶尔会在某个时期出现飙升，比如2001年9月11日恐怖袭击后就是如此；但总体而言下降趋势相当明显。	Of course, these figures surged occasionally during that period, such as after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; but the overall decline is considerable.
但接下来我们就不得不面对此次危机中时间最长也最危险的第三项因素：那就是欧元区南部和北部国家的结构性失衡。	But that leaves the third, longest-term, and most dangerous factor underlying the crisis: the structural imbalance between the eurozone’s north and south.
很显然，嘉吉只字不提它使用有争议的技术；相反，这家公司将EverSweet说成是“特制的烘焙师酵母 ” ， 好像配方出自几个世纪前的巴伐利亚乡村。	Tellingly, Cargill does not advertise its use of the controversial technology; instead, the company describes EverSweet as the product of “specially crafted baker’s yeast,” as if it were a recipe brewed for centuries in Bavarian villages.
在对希腊的贷款中，IMF好像是在借钱给准国家单位（如省级或市级政府 ） ， 而没有要求国家当局做出偿付担保。	In lending to Greece, it is as if the Fund had lent to a sub-national unit, such as a provincial or city government, without insisting on repayment guarantees from the national authorities.
较快的技术进步和较高的工作或储蓄偏好是一件好事，因为它们能够提振劳动力和资本的供给 — — 从而提振就业和投资。	Faster technological progress and a greater preference to work or to save were to be welcomed, because they would boost the supply of labor and capital – and thus employment and investment.
在穆雷看来，问题在于社会保险意味着做得不好不会导致崩溃 — — 我们需要导致崩溃的坏行为，这样才能让人们不再做出坏行为。	For Murray, it is that social insurance means that behaving badly does not lead to catastrophe – and we need bad behavior to lead to catastrophe in order to keep people from behaving badly.
但是，投票结果出炉后，决策者将不再有任何借口不去解决根本性的长期问题 — — 如何经营一个成员如此多样化的共同货币区。	After the votes are counted, however, policymakers will no longer have any excuse not to address the fundamental longer-term issues of how to run a common currency with such diverse members.
这种权利有一个符合逻辑的补充，就是通过按下岗人员征税，并且随资历的增加而提高税率，让雇主承担关闭工厂的社会成本。	The logical complement of such freedom would be to make employers pay for the social costs of plant closings, by levying a tax on layoffs, which would increase with seniority.
银行获得了规模史无前例的援助，而那些向银行贷款的国家却在削减社会福利项目，并因此面临着不断高涨的社会矛盾和政治不稳定状况。	Banks are receiving ever-larger bailouts, while countries that borrowed are cutting social programs and face rising social tensions and political instability as a result.
土耳其也是如此，上季度增长率下降至2.3 % — —总算胜过了人口增长率，但与2010年和2011年的突飞猛进（增长率高达9 % ） 相比显得相当疲软。	The same can be said of Turkey, where growth has sagged to 2.3% in the latest quarter – which at least beats population growth but is meager compared with the country’s go-go years of 2010 and 2011, when it expanded by 9%.
比如，帮助世界最贫困人口摆脱柴火、木炭和动物粪便等传统燃料能够大大地减少因空气污染导致的死亡和疾病，特别是妇女和儿童。	For example, helping the world’s poorest people shift away from traditional fuels such as firewood, charcoal, and animal dung would go a long way toward reducing deaths and illnesses from air pollution, especially among women and children.
米兰 — — 2007-09年危机爆发后，政府债务的迅速大量增加已经成为发达国家的一种普遍现象：经合组织国家平均债务在GDP中的占比首次超过了100 % 。	MILAN – A rapid and large increase of government debt has been a general phenomenon in the advanced countries since the 2007-09 crisis: for the first time, the average debt/GDP ratio for OECD countries has surpassed 100%.
美国的可比数字为接近20 % ， 和英国一样，在美国股票和债务资本市场对企业投资融资的作用比银行贷款重要得多。	The comparable figure is nearer 20% in the US, where, as in the UK, equity and debt capital markets play a much more important role in financing business investment.
如果像人们想象的那样，某些国家的叛乱组织已经拥有了生物或核材料，那么恐怖分子就可能摧毁数以百万计的无辜生命。	If one imagines a deviant group in some society gaining access to biological or nuclear materials, it is possible terrorists could destroy millions of lives.
一项研究表明，2009年，美国各行业知识资本 — — 专利权、版权、数据库、品牌和组织知识 — — 占企业总市值的44 % 。	One study found that in 2009, across a variety of industries in the US, intellectual capital – patents, copyrights, databases, brands, and organizational knowledge – held a 44% share of firms’ overall market value.
始于2007年的互换安排最初是临时性措施，在美联储、欧洲央行和瑞士国民银行间建立了联系，但每逢新危机动摇市场，这一安排就会扩大一次。	Originally created as a temporary fix in 2007, the swap lines established at that time connecting the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank have been extended each time a new crisis has unsettled the markets.
事实上，7月联合国艾滋病计划署宣布，在2015年前让1,500万人获得救命的HIV治疗的目标已经提前实现。	Indeed, in July, UNAIDS announced that the goal of having 15 million people on life-saving HIV treatment by the end 2015 was met ahead of schedule.
在《21世纪的21个教训 》 （ 21 Lessons for the 21st Century）一书中，哈里里提出了一个重要问题：民族主义能够解决全球化世纪的问题吗？ 或者 ， “ 还是一种逃避现实的放纵，可能让人类和整个生物圈坠入灾难 ？ ”	In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Harari poses an important question: Can nationalism address the problems of a globalized world, “or is it an escapist indulgence that may doom humankind and the entire biosphere to disaster?”
一个反对美国全球霸权的大规模欧亚大陆集团的突然出现即便不意味着联盟关系的彻底改变，至少也预示着新的变数在地缘政治关系中逐渐形成。	A great Eurasian bloc suddenly appeared in opposition to America’s hegemonic global pretensions, prefiguring a new fluidity in geopolitical relationships, if not a tectonic shift in alignments.
首先是经济领域：因为推行阻碍企业投资和聘用的政策，不仅目前经济增长缓慢，而且这种缓慢将延续下去，不给人以喘息的机会。	The first is economic: not just the current reality of slow growth, but the prospect that slow growth will continue without respite, owing above all to policies that often discourage businesses from investing and hiring.
看看他的对手的那些煽动成性、充满咒骂的选战 — — 比如唐纳德·特朗普和泰德·科鲁兹（Ted Cruz）参议员 — — 不禁让你为这个大老党哀叹。	Watching the incendiary, invective-filled campaigns of his opponents – Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz – makes one mourn for the Grand Old Party.
未来11国从未获得像金砖四国这个缩写词的声望，当年（2001）我创造这个词是用来概括未来将对世界经济产生重大影响的新兴经济体（巴西，俄罗斯，印度和中国 ） 。	The N-11 never acquired the cachet of the BRIC acronym, which I coined in 2001 to describe a bloc of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) that stood to have a significant impact on the world economy in the future.
我们的贷款工具比以前更加灵活了，以便金融支持能够更快地抵达成员国，为它们创造空间进行急需支出支持增长、保护最脆弱人群。	We have made our lending instruments more flexible, so that financial support can reach our members quickly, leaving sufficient room for high-priority spending to support growth and protect the most vulnerable.
但如今，与伊斯兰国的战争基本结束，我们的国际支持者声音越来越小 — — 正如土耳其火箭的声音越来越响。	But now, with the fight against ISIS largely over, our international backers have grown quieter – just as Turkey’s rockets have gotten louder.
在这方面，他们可能会建议，一旦增长恢复，应该在节假日期间征收特别礼品或销售税，甚至在GDP增长速度超过充分就业状态所对应的水平时取消圣诞节。	To that end, they might recommend a special gift or sales tax during the festive season once growth has recovered, or even canceling Christmas when the pace of GDP growth exceeds that consistent with full employment.
由于每个欧盟成员国都有义务贡献其1%的GNI作为欧盟预算，因此英国的数据修正导致它需要多缴纳数十亿欧元。	Because every EU member state is obliged to contribute about 1% of its GNI to the Union’s budget, the UK’s data revision had to lead to a back payment of billions of euros.
从1992年以来，环绕地球飞行的卫星每隔10天就极为精确地测量全球海平面水平，其精确度达到三到四毫米（0.2英寸 ） 。	It has slightly decreased . Since 1992, satellites orbiting the planet have measured the global sea level every 10 days with an amazing degree of accuracy – 3-4 millimeters (0.2 inches).
在十七世纪的欧洲，一场波西米亚新教徒与信奉天主教的哈布斯堡皇帝费迪南二世的地方宗教冲突引起了一场时代冲突。	In seventeenth-century Europe, a local religious uprising by Bohemian Protestants against the Catholic Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II triggered that era’s conflagration.
根据法国费加罗杂志所做的一项民意调查，萨尔科奇一月份的民众支持率猛跌八个点，仅仅达到41 % ， 这是他上台以来最低的，而七月份最高曾经达到65 % 。	According to the TNS Sofres poll for Le Figaro Magazine, Sarkozy’s popularity tumbled a whopping eight percentage points in January, to just 41%, the lowest level since he took office last May and down from a high of 65% in July.
大家都是人，减轻危害措施全球通行，更何况最大的受益者就是这些国家本身 — — 减少艾滋病毒传播，犯罪率下降，吸毒者也能重新投入工作。	Humans are humans. Harm reduction works everywhere, and the main financial benefactors are the countries themselves, which see reduced spread of HIV, drops in crime, and people returning to work.
从那以后，这个国家就不懈地试验全局性的替代发展方针，在强调经济发展的同时突出文化、心理健康、同情和群体等因素。	Since then, the country has been experimenting with an alternative, holistic approach to development that emphasizes not only economic growth, but also culture, mental health, compassion, and community.
事实上，该党并无明确的政策目标，只是利用了公众对意大利政治精英的厌憎 — — 这一情绪直接导致了最新选举没能产生优势明显的赢家。	Indeed, the movement lacks clear policy objectives, instead capitalizing on popular disgust with Italy’s political elites – a sentiment that led directly to the last election’s failure to produce a clear winner.
而奥巴马政府也在就何时重新提交《全面禁止核试验条约 》 — —此条约10年前遭到美国参议院否决 — — 的问题咨询国会。	The Obama administration is also consulting with Congress on when to re-submit the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was rejected by the Senate 10 years ago.
难怪另一位环境主义者麦克吉本说 ： “ 我们人类正在毫无顾及地淹没地球的大部分地区以及其他生物 。 ”	Little wonder that fellow environmentalist Bill McKibben states that “we are engaging in a reckless drive-by drowning of much of the rest of the planet and much of the rest of creation.”
此外，由于当初在成本较低时对节能和能源安全投资不足，如今美国在面临油价真实价格上涨的局面时显得尤为被动。	And now, having underinvested in energy efficiency and security when the costs of doing so were lower, America is poorly positioned to face the prospect of rising real prices.
通过表明你会在哪里为你的女儿找一条狗来养，比通过大量无人阅读的有关立场的论文，更能告诉整个国家你的价值观。	You can tell the nation more about your values by saying where you will seek a dog for your daughters than you can through reams of unread position papers.
IPCC 的第四次评估报告引用哈斯南的说法，虽可以说有点冒失，但不能说是颠倒黑白，因为在该报告最终成型的前一年，也就是 2003~2004 年的时候，改变后的新趋势仍然不容易认清。	The IPCC’s use of his remark may have been rash, but was not misleading because in 2003-2004, the year before it finalized its fourth report, the changed trend would have been barely perceptible
只要伊朗表现出准备在JCPOA到期后取得突破的信号，就应该对其实施严厉制裁；这一点也没有被协议排除。	Harsh sanctions should be reintroduced at the first sign that Iran is preparing a post-JCPOA breakout; this, too, is not precluded by the accord.
看看华盛顿抗议者们反复呼喊的口号吧 ： “ 不要燃煤，不要汽油，不要核能，不要欺骗 ” ， “生物燃料—绝对不要 ” ， 显然他们将会排除许多可行的替代品。	Judging from their chant – “No coal, no gas, no nukes, no kidding” and “Biofuels - hell no!” – the protesters in Washington would rule out many plausible alternatives.
中国和俄罗斯等专制国家，领导人拒绝采取削弱根深蒂固的游说集团和既得利益集团权力的改革，从而导致因反腐败和寻租情绪激发的社会不安转变为示威。	In autocracies like China and Russia, leaders resist the radical reforms that would reduce the power of entrenched lobbies and interests, thereby fueling social unrest as resentment against corruption and rent-seeking boils over into protest.
美国人知道，如果步子迈得太大太快，欧洲就会公开与美国方针决裂，因为欧洲人与俄罗斯的经济利益比美国大得多。	The Americans understand that if they go too far too fast, Europe will publicly break with the US approach, because the Europeans have a lot more at stake economically.
理论上，英国现在可以就大量市场准入问题进行谈判，但几乎肯定需要接受布鲁塞尔所制定的规则 — — 而这正是英国选民所投票反对的。	In principle, Britain could now negotiate a great deal of market access, but this would almost certainly require accepting rules made in Brussels – which is just what the British voted against.
这种通缩趋势将会产生严重的经济问题。 这些问题不一定是因为通缩产生的，倒有可能是源于针对通缩作出的天然抵抗。	This deflationary tendency will create serious economic problems, which do not necessarily result from deflation as such, but may stem from a natural resistance to deflation.
Luis Christiansen的Consultores 21公司、Varianzas公司和Keller公司等多家较中立的调查公司的民调显示，摇摆选民比例惊人地高，他们或者没有表达自己的投票倾向，或者根本不知道该投谁。	Many of the more impartial polling firms, such as Luis Christiansen’s Consultores 21, Varianzas, and Keller, all show a surprisingly large proportion of undecided voters – those who do not answer or do not know for whom they will vote.
因此，未来十年的一个关键问题将是，随着进一步经济和政治改革的逐渐实施，中国当局的增长目标是否足以维持社会凝聚力。	A key question for the next decade, therefore, is whether the Chinese authorities’ growth targets will be enough to preserve social cohesion as further economic and political reforms are gradually implemented.
冲突主要集中在外交层面、思想层面和经济层面（特别是在石油市场 ） ， 以及通过叙利亚和也门冲突等代理人战争。	It is being fought diplomatically, ideologically, and economically – especially in the oil markets – and through proxy wars, such as the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.
事实上，服务业人员人均附加值仍然仅有制造业的40 ％ ， 且1980年至2010年间的年均生产率增长仅为2 % — —远远落后于制造业8.2%的年均增长率。	Indeed, value added per worker in the services sector remains just 40% of that in the manufacturing sector, and annual productivity growth was only 2% from 1980 to 2010 – significantly lower than the manufacturing sector’s rate of 8.2%.
在那里我听到了一些石油行业高管们讨论的风声，他们一致同意在明年这个时候原油价格仍然会像今天这样维持在每桶60美元左右。	While there, I caught the tail end of a discussion among senior oil executives who all agreed that at this time next year, crude oil will still be around $60 per barrel, as it is today.
借款国常常不愿意接受世界银行的建议，它们认为这些建议更多地是根据理论和意识形态，而不是根据证据和实践。	Borrowers have often been reluctant to accept its advice, which they perceive as driven more by theory and ideology than by evidence and practice.
奥巴马作为总统的最后一批动作之一是美国在联合国安理会上就反对色列在占领区的定居点建设的提案投出弃权票，而不是否决票。	One of Obama’s last acts as president was to have the US abstain from voting on a United Nations Security Council resolution against Israeli settlement-building in the occupied territories, rather than vetoing it.
由于欧盟在今年5月成功地吸纳了10个新成员国-包括8个经济发展水平低得多的前共产主义国家-有人就认为欧盟应该到此为止了。	Greece knows this very well. It was our belief in Europe as a catalyst for peace and prosperity that led us to support Turkey’s EU aspirations.
如果再加上土耳其的地区野心和努力将自己定位为巴勒斯坦事业的主要支持者，土耳其似乎在对埃及的切身利益发起直接挑战。	Together with its regional ambitions and efforts to position itself as the main champion of the Palestinian cause, Turkey appears to be directly challenging Egypt’s vital interests.
该协会近期对来自四个种群的270个个体开展了评估（这些个体具有非洲、亚洲或欧洲的血统, 被称为抽样图谱集）以构建人类基因的新图谱。	The Consortium recently assessed 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Africa, Asia or Europe (known as the HapMap collection) to construct a new map of the human genome.
当然，美国也许会通过暂停升息或调整退出量化宽松的节奏来应对人民币贬值，而日本可能加码其自身的量化宽松以应对消极溢出效应。	To be sure, the US may respond to China’s devaluation by postponing interest-rate hikes or moderating the pace of its withdrawal from quantitative easing, and Japan may intensify its own QE to cope with negative spillovers.
财政刺激在这些情况下相对会更有效一些，因为它能在无需抬高处于最低点的利率和不压抑私人企业需求（一般情况下则会）的情况下创造对商品的需求。	Fiscal stimulus is relatively more effective in these conditions, because it creates demand for goods without driving up those rock-bottom interest rates and crowding out private-sector demand (as it would in normal times).
伦敦市插入了中国留下的投资缝隙，提高了对美政府债券的购买量。 在2008～2009年期间，伦敦的购买量是每月10亿美元左右，在今年头7个月增至平均每月280亿美元。	The City of London has jumped into the breach, increasing its purchases, which in 2008 and 2009 amounted to only about $1 billion monthly, to an average of $28 billion in the first seven months of this year.
但最近对在该国寻求避难的土库曼斯坦持不同政见者Annadurdy Hadjiev的逮捕和威胁驱逐出境的事件说明有些事情还是没有改观。	But the recent arrest and threatened deportation of Annadurdy Hadjiev, a dissident from Turkmenistan who sought refuge here, suggests that some things never change.
无论人们用“Yangon”还是“Rangoon”来称呼缅甸的首都仰光，这个地方仍然如英国旅行作家诺曼·路易斯（Norman Lewis）所描述的那样是一个“由一群不愿向东方妥协的人民所建造的 … … 自顾自发展的帝国 ” 。	And whether one uses “Yangon” or “Rangoon” to identify Myanmar/Burma’s capital, the place still remains what the British travel writer Norman Lewis described as “imperial and rectilinear…built by a people who refused compromise with the East.”
但如果要真正遏制欧洲所面临的民族主义威胁，德国必须与马克隆合作来应对那些导致众多选民背弃欧盟的经济挑战。	But if the nationalist threat to Europe is truly to be contained, Germany will have to work with Macron to address the economic challenges that have driven so many voters to reject the European Union.
萨勒曼的一些动作获得了国际媒体的正面宣传，比如他下令允许妇女驾驶汽车并削减负责执行公众场合穿着规范的宗教警察的权力。	Some of MBS’s actions have garnered favorable international press coverage, not least his decrees allowing women to drive and curtailing the power of the religious police, who have long enforced public dress codes.
琼根有一位荷兰籍的父亲和一位意大利籍的母亲，讲着几乎无懈可击的英语，出生在意大利讲德语的南蒂罗尔州。	The son of a Dutch father and an Italian mother, born in Italy’s German-speaking South Tyrol, Jongen spoke near-perfect English.
但如果我们在今后数十年继续维持原来的状况，我们可能触发长达数百年的海平面上升，即使我们随后结束所有的温室气体排放仍将造成渐进但却无情的后果。	If, however, we continue on our current path for just a couple more decades, we could trigger centuries of rising sea levels, even if we subsequently ended all greenhouse-gas emissions. The effects would be gradual but merciless.
如果债务水平已然很高的政府人为它们不能继续向公众借钱，那么它们应该向央行借钱，并把额外的资金用于公共工程和基础设施项目。	If governments, with their already-high level of indebtedness, believe that they cannot borrow any more from the public, they should borrow from their central banks and spend the extra money themselves on public works and infrastructure projects.
因此，进入股票市场对人们的吸引了增加了，这即使对那些从根本上怀疑股票市场的繁荣能否持续下去的人，也是如此。	A temptation arises to get into the market, even among people who are fundamentally doubtful that the boom will continue.
革命运动驱逐了埃及穆巴拉克和突尼斯齐纳·阿比丁·本阿里（现在就藏在利雅得）等久经考验的原有盟友，而且把原本可以容忍的叙利亚巴沙尔·阿萨德政权变成了凶残的对手。	It ousted reliable old allies like Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali (now hiding out in Riyadh), and turned once-tolerable regimes like Bashar al-Assad’s in Syria into murderous opponents.
我们组成合作社、组织和社会的能力基础并非来源于先天的合作倾向，而是来源于我们学习、内化并要求他人执行的具体的社会规则。	The foundation of our ability to form cooperative communities, organizations, and societies arises not from innate cooperative tendencies, but from the specifics of the social norms that we learn, internalize, and enforce on others.
Hannah Arendt在她的经典研究《论革命》中阴沉地写道 ： “ 无论人类达到怎样的兄弟之情，都脱胎于同胞残杀；无论人们组成怎样的政治团体，都起源于罪恶 ” 。	In her classic study On Revolution, Hannah Arendt observed darkly that “whatever brotherhood human beings may be capable of has grown out of fratricide, whatever political organization men may have achieved has its origin in crime.”
美国的美元负债随时都有可能达到临界点，如果担惊受怕的投资者因为寻找其他价值储藏手段而引起不可逆转的下降螺旋的话。	America’s dollar liabilities could reach a tipping point at any time, if skittish investors, seeking an alternative store of value, precipitate an irreversible downward spiral.
这一反弹最激烈的部分发生在4月17日，即欧佩克达成新的价格目标并说服沙特、俄罗斯和伊朗政府合作削减产量以实现这一目标失败之后。	The steepest part of this increase occurred after April 17, when OPEC failed to agree on a new price target and persuade the Saudi, Russian, and Iranian governments to coordinate the output cuts that would be required to achieve any such target.
如果当前长期债券的反常低利率在未来几年中升高，石油生产商就有动力增加石油供给，将所获得的收入按更高的利率投资。	When the current abnormally low interest rates on long-term bonds rise over the next few years, it will become more attractive for producers to increase the supply of oil and invest the resulting income at the higher rate.
凝聚力、长期视角、适当激励、强大的“引导”能力以及果敢坚决是可贵的治国品质，特别是对需要管理复杂结构变化的精英指定制度来说。	Coherence, long time horizons, appropriate incentives, strong “navigational” skills, and decisiveness are desirable aspects of continuity in governance, especially in a meritocratic system managing complex structural shifts.
2010年以来，GDP年增长率平均约为2.1 % ， 这比过去60年以来经济萧条的平均复苏增长率的一半还要低。	Since 2010, annual GDP growth has averaged about 2.1%, less than half the average of recoveries from previous US recessions over the last 60 years.
但这样的姿态实际上等于将各国缔结一个全新气候条约的希望判了死刑 — — 因为发达国家无疑将坚持把欠发达国家纳入为解决方案的一部分。	But such a stance dooms prospects for a new global treaty, as developed countries will rightly insist that poorer countries be part of the solution.
迄今为止，以欧洲央行的“直接货币交易”项目为代表的“绝招”已经起到了预期效果 — — 根本不需要被使用。	So far, the “bazooka” represented by the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” program has had the desired effect – without having to be used.
他们承诺坚持《联合全面行动计划 》 （ 即便其强化了伊朗的常规军事力量并继续在区域内四处出击 ） 。	They have pledged to adhere to the JCPOA (even as they strengthen Iran’s conventional military capabilities and continue to pursue regional ambitions).
ICG并不如此，但它毫无例外地坚持说必须说的话，而在实践中，政府有惊人的具体批评忍受力，只要批评有理有据。	The ICG doesn’t do that, but it has always been absolutely insistent on saying whatever has needed to be said, and in practice governments have been remarkably tolerant of specific criticism, provided it is well-supported and well-argued.
但最终的问题是如果阿巴斯履行承诺 — — 制止抵抗以色列的暴力事件，并且在一个运作正常的民主国家内实行依法治国，那么以色列和国际社会将会做什么呢？	But the ultimate question is what Israel and the international community will do if Abbas fulfills his pledge to end anti-Israeli violence and apply the rule of law in a functioning democracy.
但现实却远没有那么险恶：在伊拉克战争中，美以委员会仅仅是利用了乔治·W·布什总统扮演救世主的冲动和切尼副总统单枪匹马的战争游说所掀起的侵略狂潮。	But the reality is far less sinister: in that case, AIPAC merely surfed on the pro-invasion wave unleashed by President George W. Bush, with his Messianic urges, and Vice President Dick Cheney, a one-man war lobby.
首先，关于是否通过这项税收法案的问题，萨默斯和弗尔曼就跟被他们批评的我们一样在政策制定方面有足够的经验，都知道最终产物通常会偏离经济学家的理想模型。	First, on the question of whether or not to pass this tax bill, Summers and Furman, like those of us they are criticizing, have enough experience in policymaking to know that the end product usually diverges from what economists would consider ideal.
只要利率足够高，就能诱使商业银行偏好于美联储（兼具流动性、安全性和收益性 ） ， 而不是扩大私人贷款规模。	Sufficiently high rates will induce commercial banks to prefer the Fed’s combination of liquidity, safety, and yield to expanding the quantity of private lending.
此次危机的风险极大，这正是德国、英国和法国两年前就开始与伊朗谈判希望说服伊朗放弃完成核燃料循环试验努力的原因所在。	In this crisis, the stakes are high, which is why Germany, the UK, and France began negotiations with Iran two years ago with the goal of persuading Iran to abandon its efforts to close the nuclear fuel cycle.
但这样做让欧洲央行成为金融机构的众火之的，此前，它们一直避免（至少在公开场合如此）反驳欧洲央行行长德拉吉的政策	But in doing so, it has felt the hot breath of financial institutions, which had previously abstained from contradicting ECB President Mario Draghi’s policies, at least in public.
爱丁堡—最近几周，关于欧元区复苏萌芽的讨论声音建起，关键指标表明核心国已步入扩张 — — 很多人将这些数据作为紧缩最终奏效的证据。	EDINBURGH – In recent weeks, talk about a budding recovery in the eurozone has gained traction, with key indices pointing to expansion in the core countries – data that many are citing as evidence that austerity is finally working.
这也许是一个警示，表明印度言论自由告急，而受到愤怒的暴徒威胁，而政府对此完全坐视不理的氛围，是可以清楚地感觉到的。	While it may seem alarmist to suggest that freedom of expression in India is in peril, the atmosphere of intimidation by inflamed mobs, to whom governments surrender all too willingly, is palpable.
此外各国政府还可能要支援受流行病影响的社区，资助治疗疾病或预防未来疫情方面的研究，支付因此而增加的医疗保健费用以及协助患者维持生计。	Governments may also have to compensate communities affected by epidemics, fund research to treat illness or prevent future outbreaks, cover increased health-care costs, and sustain programs to help patients.
如果这一日程取得成功，克里姆林宫的修正主义方案就会得到抵制；日益明确的是，这甚至有可能在俄罗斯打开急需的新改革风潮。	If this agenda succeeds, the Kremlin’s revisionist bid will be blocked; as this becomes apparent, there might even be an opening for a new and urgently needed wave of reform in Russia itself.
我们有足够的理由期待安南会很快再次开始斡旋，并在土耳其可能加入欧盟的2015年前后以积极的方式解决这一问题。	There is every reason to expect Annan to resume his good offices soon and to bring the question to a positive conclusion well before Turkey’s possible entry into the EU around 2015.
第二，在最近几十年的民意调查中，当被问及幸福感和对未来的看法时，法国民众的反应要比其他国家悲观10-20 % 。	All emerging countries answer “yes.” That is also the answer of a large majority in the US and in Europe.
事实上，一些AKP要人，包括埃尔多安的长期助手、总统居尔在内，认为埃尔多安在处理最近的游行方面严重失误。	In fact, some AKP heavyweights, including Erdoğan’s longtime associate, President Abdullah Gül, believe that he badly mismanaged the recent protests.
IMF也被动员通过结构性调整计划，为偿还进行担保。 如今，偿还债务需要每个索马里人，不论男女老少，拿出361美元。	The IMF was nudged into guaranteeing repayment through a structural adjustment program. Repaying the debt today would cost every Somali man, woman, and child $361.
世界需要大家携手 — — 不仅仅是俄罗斯人和美国人，还有阿拉伯人、中国人、欧洲人和其他所有国家的人。	The world needs all hands on deck – not only Russian and American, but also Arab, Chinese, European, and anyone else’s.
然而，过去二十年来，他们明目张胆的政治欺骗遭到了一股有力的新生力量的抵抗：那些不愿在恐吓面前屈服的普通人联合起来发出的声音。	But for the past twenty years their blatant political chicanery has been met with a potent new force: the massed voices of ordinary people who refuse to be cowed.
但是，尽管轮状病毒疫苗已在79个国家铺开 — — 这是个了不起的成就 — — 但全世界仍有高达74%的儿童无法在今年获得接种。	But, though rotavirus vaccines have been rolled out in 79 countries – a significant accomplishment – a staggering 74% of the world’s infants remain unlikely to be inoculated this year.
但是按照报告中的说法，穆巴拉克、他的夫人苏珊、以及他的两个儿子贾迈勒和阿莱，远远没有袖手旁观那么简单。	According to the report, however, Mubarak; his wife, Susan; and his two sons, Gamal and Alaa, are far from being mere bystanders.
如今经过几十年的地盘之争和自我边缘化，这些国际组织必须团结起来完成可持续城市化这项日益紧迫的全球任务。	Now, after decades of turf wars and self-marginalization, international organizations must rally around an increasingly pressing global priority: sustainable urbanization.
此外，尽管美国过去几年大幅增加了在欧洲的防务开支，但应当记住的是，那里的绝大多数美国军队和军事设施实际都集中在从印度到南非的战略弧。	Moreover, although the US has increased its defense outlays in Europe substantially over the past few years, it is worth remembering that most US forces and facilities there are actually focused on the geostrategic arc from India to South Africa.
20多年前，我写了一篇题为《和平时代美国唯一的通胀时期：70年代 》 （ America’s Only Peacetime Inflation: The 1970s）的文章，对这一观点提出了挑战。	More than 20 years ago, I wrote a paper called “America’s Only Peacetime Inflation: The 1970s,” in which I challenged this narrative.
拥有 13 亿人的中国是一个统一的国家，而人口 5 亿左右的欧盟也形成了统一的经济市场，其中多数成员国使用共同的货币参与流通。	China, with 1.3 billion people, is just one country; and the European Union, with some 500 million people, functions as a single economic market, with most of its members sharing a single currency.
事实上，美国是全世界最大的生物乙醇生产国，加之页岩气的生产 — — 已经在降低二氧化碳排放及创造当地就业机会的同时，减少了至少25%的国外石油进口。	Indeed, the US is the world’s largest producer of bioethanol, which – along with the production of shale gas – has helped reduce foreign oil imports by at least 25%, while lowering carbon dioxide emissions and creating local jobs.
中国政府官员在许多问题上存在分歧，但是，他们强烈而且观点鲜明的一致认为，中国必须要有一个强有力的刺激经济一揽子计划来防止更多的人失去工作，否则，中国的社会稳定就会处于危险之中。	China’s government is divided on a number of matters, but there is a strong, sharp-edged consensus that social stability is at risk unless a robust stimulus package emerges to stave off further job loss.
薄熙来的得势在很大程度上来自其家世（其父薄一波曾任副总理 ） ， 其政治赞助者还有他对游戏规则的操纵。	Bo’s rise to power owed much to his pedigree (his father was a vice premier), his political patrons, and his manipulation of the rules of the game.
但美国所领导的任务目前已经成立并作了说明，其目标是否可以以可接受的代价（时间、金钱和生命等）实现仍不清楚。	But as the US-led mission is currently conceived and described, it is not clear whether its objectives are achievable at acceptable costs in terms of time, money, and lives.
就像一个土耳其将军说的那样 ， “ 如果我们加入了华约而不是北约，到现在我们可能已经是欧盟成员国了 。 ”	As one Turkish general put it, “If we had joined the Warsaw Pact rather than NATO, we would be in the EU by now.”
自由之家组织的评分非常接近：31个非阿拉伯穆斯林国家中，有12个连续3年以上得分较高，其中8个连续5年以上获得了高分。	The Freedom House scores are remarkably similar: 12 of 31 non-Arab Muslim countries had relatively high scores for at least three consecutive years, and eight for five consecutive years.
酒类管理方面的经验表明这些手段将虽然能在一定程度上减少吸食所带来的坏处，且无法完全消灭它，尤其是当大麻销售者被允许推广自己的商品的时候。	Experience with alcohol suggests that these approaches may modestly reduce, but not eliminate, the harms associated with use, especially if sellers are allowed to promote their wares.
据IMF的数据，中国年GDP增长已从2010年的10%放缓至8 % ； 与此同时，印度增长率从11.2%降至5.7 % 。	According to the IMF, China’s annual GDP growth has slowed to 8%, from 10% in 2010; over the same period, India’s growth rate slowed from 11.2% to 5.7%.
根据世界银行的数据，每年都有500万新增15岁以上人口，而15岁是“告别童年，进入成年的门槛 ” 。	According to the World Bank, each year an additional five million turn 15, “crossing the threshold from childhood to adulthood.”
巴基斯坦国内情报局（ISI）和印度调查分析局（RAW）之间无所不用其极的情报大战已经成为南亚地区一个残酷的现实。	Violent intelligence wars between Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) have become a brutal reality in South Asia.
尽管拥有伊尔哈姆·阿利耶夫总统的支持和优先使用国家资源的权利，阿塞拜疆执政党新阿塞拜疆党仍然面临着全面的挑战。	Azerbaijan’s ruling party, Eni Azerbaijan, faces challenges all around, despite the support of President Ilham Aliyev and privileged access to state resources.
这种干预 — — 也是任何央行所能承诺的最大手笔干预 — — 让中国人民银行别无选择，只能大幅收紧资本管制。	That intervention – the largest that any central bank has ever undertaken – left the PBOC with little choice but to tighten capital controls substantially.
在许多俄罗斯的贵族群体中，贪污腐败屡见不鲜。 这中行为和许多在非洲具有同样地位人的灾难性习惯非常相似。	The corrupt enrichment of so many Russian elites mimics the disastrous habits of many of their African counterparts.
新一轮的谈判相比以前所做的努力有一个优势，因为各国政府现在认识到需要在适应、减缓和研究气候变化方面采取组合拳的方式。	The new negotiations will have one advantage over the earlier efforts, because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation, mitigation, and research efforts.
人类学中有一个总体生育率（Total Fertility Rate）的概念，指每个女性在其一生中的平均生育数量。	What demographers call the Total Fertility Rate is the average number of live births per woman over her lifetime.
此外，关键问题是，布热津斯基忘了奥巴马不仅因为关注以色列安全抑或整个中东地区稳定而决意阻止伊朗获取核武器。	Moreover, and crucially, Brzezinski forgets that Obama’s determination to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon does not stem only from his concern for Israel’s security or the stability of the wider Middle East.
视频可以设计成模块，以便让学校使用（比如）一个课程包来教授课程的第一部分，而用完全不同的另一个课程包来教授第二部分。	And videos could be used in modules, so a school could choose to use, say, one package to teach the first part of a course, and a completely different package to teach the second part.
首先，在1960年代最早发现社交焦虑的专家（伦敦的Isaac Marks，一位在恐惧和惊恐疾病方面的著名专家）就坚决反对将其作为一种专门的病种列入 DSM-III 。	For starters, the specialist who in the 1960’s originally recognized social anxiety (London-based Isaac Marks, a renowned expert on fear and panic) strongly resisted its inclusion in DSM-III as a separate disease category.
事实上，玛沙尔的这一决定彻底断绝了他本人与其两大重要盟友之间的联系，不但削弱了他的地位，也增加了其拥抱政治改革的决心。	Indeed, Mashal’s decision has effectively ended his ties to his two most important allies, thereby not only weakening his position, but also increasing his readiness to embrace political moderation.
智利是地区内表现最好的经济体，但仍高度依赖铜出口，而巴切莱特的支持率也下降到前所未有的新低，威胁到她雄心勃勃的宪法和教育改革日程。	Even in Chile – perhaps the best-run economy in the region, but still highly dependent on copper exports – Bachelet’s approval rating has plunged to unprecedented lows, threatening her ambitious agenda of constitutional and educational reforms.
虽然大概有部分是出自于实现社会正义的动机，但实际上贝隆是在贿赂那些受益者来为自身权力财富的崛起铺路。	Although his motivation, at least in part, may have been a desire for social justice, Perón was, in effect, bribing the beneficiaries to support his own rise to power and wealth.
事实上败走西贡后美国确实转向保守，而在1989年苏联撤出阿富汗后，美国人对这个国家的漠视则导致阿国内部陷入混乱，几乎让基地组织夺取了整个政权。	America did, indeed, turn inward following the fall of Saigon, and its neglect of Afghanistan following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 led to chaos and Al Qaeda’s near-takeover of the country.
移民危机和最近的恐怖袭击意味着关于是否保留欧盟成员资格的全民公决 — — 有望在明年举行 — — 可能导致英国退出欧盟。	And the migration crisis and recent terrorist attacks mean that a referendum on continued EU membership – likely to be held next year – could lead the United Kingdom to withdraw.
他们从而得出结论说，人民币对美元汇率上的调整没有理由对中国的储蓄与投资产生重大影响，更别提对美国的储蓄与投资有什么影响了。	There is no reason, they conclude, why a change in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate should have a first-order impact on savings or investment in China, much less in the US.
它们帮助地球摆脱了天花，即将消灭脊髓灰质炎，并且每一年能挽救数百万人的生命，减轻传染病造成的痛苦和负担。	They have helped rid the planet of the scourge of smallpox, are poised to eliminate polio, and each year prevent millions of deaths, reducing the suffering and costs caused by infectious diseases.
事实上，如果你用谷歌搜索“成功的识字运动 ” ， 那么在你的屏幕上列出的识字率进步巨大的国家是古巴 — — 它绝对不属于自由市场制度。	In fact, if you Google “successful literacy campaign,” the country with astonishing literacy gains that fills your screen is Cuba – hardly a free-market system.
亚洲合作对话组织被用来使泰国成为东南亚的政治重心；伊洛瓦底江、昭披耶河与湄公河经济合作战略会议则使得其成为该地区经济发展的关键；而众多的双边协议则将会加强其与该地区大国的关系。	The ACD was designed to make Thailand the political center of gravity in Southeast Asia; ACMECS was to make it the region’s linchpin of economic development; and the bilateral agreements would cement relations with the biggest players in the region.
今年10月， 来自44个国家的128名人权和平等领域的著名专家，开展了一项里程碑式工作，我们要在1948年联合国具有划时代意义的声明的基础上，建立普遍的人类平等。	This October, 128 leading experts in the fields of human rights and equality from 44 countries launched a landmark attempt to build on the epochal 1948 UN declaration to establish universal human equality.
考虑到分裂的半岛正在面对 — — 并且今后仍将持续面对的所有机遇和挑战，统一仍将是我们必须继续为之奋斗的重要目标。	Considering all of the challenges and opportunities that the divided peninsula faces – and will continue to confront in the coming years – unification remains an important goal that we must continue to pursue.
购买资金可以通过发行欧洲债券（European Treasury bill，即成员国共同承担的各种义务）筹集，而廉价融资的好处则由受助国接受。	It would finance the purchases by issuing European Treasury bills – joint and several obligations of the member countries – and pass on the benefit of cheap financing to the countries concerned.
位于印度西南部的喀拉拉邦的海岸线分布着中国式的渔网，马来亚力（Malayali）主妇最喜欢的烹饪工具是在当地叫 cheen-chetti （意思是中国船）的锅。	Southwest India’s Kerala coastline is dotted with Chinese-style fishing nets, and the favorite cooking pot of the Malayali housewife is the wok, locally called the cheen-chetti (Chinese vessel).
基辛格重点探讨国家关系 — — 即从某个国家的角度来看，如何在阻止其他国家发起侵略或可能破坏地区或全球权力平衡的其他行为的同时避免与这些国家发生战争。	Kissinger focuses on inter-state relations – on how, from one country’s perspective, to avoid war with other countries while deterring them from aggression or other actions likely to upset a regional or global balance of power.
考虑到中国鞭策国内公司赴海外投资的“走出去政策”以及建设洲际贸易基础设施的“一带一路”框架的合力，这一趋势还将持续下去。	This trend can only continue, considering the combined impact of China’s “Go Out Policy” of prodding domestic companies to make investments abroad, and it’s “One Belt, One Road” framework to build continent-wide trade infrastructure.
发自莫斯科 — — 最近，萦绕在我脑际的总是我的曾祖父尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫，我猜首先挑动我思绪的也许是他同尼克松总统的所谓“厨房辩论”刚好过去了整整50周年。	MOSCOW – My great-grandfather, Nikita Khrushchev, has been on my mind recently. I suppose it was the 50th anniversary of the so-called “kitchen debate” which he held with Richard Nixon that first triggered my memories.
伦敦—在《为什么你打桥牌赢不了 》 （ Why You Lose at Bridge，这是最有趣的关于桥牌的书）中，我舅父西蒙（S. J. Simon）建议选手和他的对家“不要追求最好的可能结果，最好结果的可能 ” 。	LONDON – In Why You Lose at Bridge (the funniest book about bridge ever written), my uncle, S. J. Simon, advised players to aim “not for the best possible result, but the best result possible” with the partner you have.
此外，在一个相对高增长的经济体中，只要这些债务被用于资助投资，无论是产生高回报或创造了价值超过债务的资产，那么高债务水平显然并不一定是个问题。	Moreover, in a relatively high-growth economy, ostensibly high debt levels are not necessarily a problem, as long as that debt is being used to fund investments that either yield high returns or create assets worth more than the debt.
新兴市场经济体担任该组织的主席国，韩国不是第一个，但它是全球金融危机之后的第一个；而且也是自 G-20 成为世界经济的指导性协商机制以来，第一个担任其主席国的新兴市场经济体。	Korea is not the first emerging market to chair the G-20, but it is the first to do so since the global financial crisis. And it is the first to do so since the G-20 emerged as the steering committee for the world economy.
上述结论呼应了时任国务卿希拉里·克林顿2009年所发出的警告，她曾警告说巴基斯坦“对我们国家和世界的安全构成了致命的威胁 。 ”	This conclusion echoes then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s warning in 2009 that Pakistan “poses a mortal threat to the security and safety of our country and the world.”
33年前，在哈维尔的努力下，出台了代表所有持不同政见者及铁幕笼罩下其他民众理想的标志性文件《77宪章 》 。	Thirty-three years ago, Havel helped initiate Charter 77, the landmark document that crystallized the ideals of all the dissidents – and many others – trapped behind the Iron Curtain.
根据波恩国际军事设施向民用转化研究中心（Bonn International Center for Conversion）发布的全球军事化​​指数，俄罗斯是全球最军事化程度最高的国家之一。	According to the Global Militarization Index of the Bonn International Center for Conversion, Russia is among the most militarized countries in the world.
它们放任全球失衡日积月累，亲切地看着巨大的信用泡沫产生，忽视按揭市场所闪现的危险信号，不假思索地赞美薪酬过高的投资银行家所创造的创新但有毒的金融产品。	They allowed global imbalances to build up, looked benignly on a massive credit bubble, ignored flashing danger signs in the mortgage market, and uncritically admired the innovative but toxic products devised by overpaid investment bankers.
除了北约（虽然它正处于低潮期，但仍然十分重要 ） ， 谈判中的跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系提供了形成基于规则的国际秩序的好机会。	Beyond NATO, which remains important even at a low ebb, the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership offers a potent opportunity to shape a rule-based international order.
如果默克尔本就希望在布鲁塞尔达成协议，那么结果将标志着欧元区危机政策的基本转变，其本人也将展现成功政治家的风采。	If Merkel had wanted the agreement reached in Brussels, the outcome would have marked the beginning of a fundamental revision of the eurozone’s crisis policy – and thus an expression of successful statesmanship.
穆沙拉夫与巴基斯坦军方将许多美国最希望抓获的基地组织成员交了出去，这其中包括哈立德·谢赫·穆罕默德以及埃及籍成员、也门籍成员、沙特籍成员等等。	He and the Pakistani army delivered many of the Al Qaeda members most wanted by the US – Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Egyptians, Yemenis, Saudis, and so on.
类似可可、咖啡，茶叶和香蕉这样的公平贸易产品与欧洲本地产品并无竞争，因此也并不存在任何贸易保护主义动机。	Fair-trade products like cocoa, coffee, tea, and bananas do not compete with domestic European production, and therefore do not have a protectionist motive.
有趣的是，大多数欧洲大银行的主要投资目标是其他欧洲市场，而不是世界其他地区，这使得欧洲市场对总营收额的贡献达到了近30 % ， 而十年前这一数字为20 % 。	Interestingly, most large European banks’ prime investment destination was other European markets, not other parts of the world, raising Europe’s contribution to total revenue to nearly 30%, from less than 20% a decade ago.
从习近平主席的“新时代”百年远景来看，从进口到本土创新的转变是中国长期战略的核心，一方面为了避免“中等收入陷阱 ” ， 一方面要在2050年实现大国地位。	And a transformation from imported to indigenous innovation is central to China’s long-term strategy, both to avoid the “middle-income trap” and to achieve great-power status by 2050, as per President Xi Jinping’s “new era” centenary aspirations.
事实上，现今法国总统的所谓失败，��不仅仅是由于那些当选者的不称职，而都应归因于一个涉及法国宪法核心的架构问题。	Indeed, it could very well be that the failures of recent French presidents point to a structural problem at the heart of the French constitution, and not just to the shortcomings of its various incumbents.
美国国内的厌战情绪不断蔓延，于是乎贝拉克·奥巴马总统增兵阿富汗的命令迟迟难以下达，尽管他的将军已一再敦促。	Weariness with the war is spreading in the United States, where President Barack Obama finds it difficult to decide about an increase in troops, as demanded by his own generals.
但是我们知道，至少有30个手持AK47步枪和手榴弹的恐怖分子劫持了印度商业和金融中心中的人质，这些恐怖分子的目标既有印度人也有外国人，特别是美国人和英国人。	But we do know that at least 30 men armed with AK47 rifles and grenades held India’s business and financial center hostage, targeting both Indians and foreigners, particularly Americans and British.
转基因食品在美国市场已经存在12年之久。 在美国人所消费的食品中，绝大多数都属于转基因食品或者在制造过程中采用过转基因技术。	It is unusual that a new technology has no negative side effects.
这一转变背后的政策愿景写在去年10月党的十九大报告中，习近平特别强调了发展“新时代中国特色社会主义”的14个关键政策领域。	The vision behind this shift was articulated at the Communist Party of China’s 19th National Congress last October, when Xi stressed 14 policy areas that would be critical to develop “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”
比如，要把钱弄出中国，中国卖家会与西方进口商合作，大幅低报后者所实际支付的款项的美元价值，差价则存入海外银行账户。	For example, to get money out of China, a Chinese seller might report a dollar value far below what she was actually paid by a cooperating Western importer, with the difference being deposited into an overseas bank account.
特朗普退出2015年伊核协议，完全无视伊朗充分遵守协议的事实，如果这导致发生任何冲突和动荡，特朗普难逃其咎。	The same will go for whatever conflict and instability arises from Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal despite Iran’s full compliance with its terms.
但战争新保守主义推动者引述的观点却直接来源于肯尼迪时代：民主的传播、自由的事业和具有普遍权威性的“美国价值观 ” 。	But the language used by those wars’ neo-conservative promoters came straight from the Kennedy era: the spread of democracy, the cause of liberty, and the universal authority of “American values.”
按照英国著名战略学家劳伦斯·弗里德曼的说法，在凸显美国不同于“以往主导大国”的各项特色中，最重要的是美国的实力基础是联盟而非殖民 。 ”	Among the features that distinguish the US from “the dominant great powers of the past,” according to the distinguished British strategist Lawrence Freedman, is that “American power is based on alliances rather than colonies.”
它不仅有助于学生及其家庭更好地做出选择；还能鼓励教育工作者和国家决策者开展研究和创新对话，并敦促表现不佳的机构改进工作。	It will not only help students and their families make better choices; it will also spur a dialogue that encourages research and innovation by educators and state policymakers, and puts pressure on underperforming institutions to improve.
到今年为止，加纳、肯尼亚、老挝、马达加斯加、马拉维、莫桑比克、尼日尔、塞拉利昂、坦桑尼亚和津巴布韦都已采取措施推广HPV疫苗，后续还有更多国家会迎头赶上。	As of this year, Ghana, Kenya, Laos, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe have all taken steps to introduce HPV vaccines, with more countries expected to follow.
但在被那些掌握金融系统命脉的企业滥用了之后，这些东西就能摧毁整个金融系统 — — 原因就是该系统的设计缺陷。	But, when over-used by systemically vital firms, they can blow up the financial system, owing to its design defects.
随着美国2016年总统竞选活动的逐步深入，许多选民确信 — — 系统被人“操纵 ” ， 他们这样的想法也并非全无理由。	In the US, as the 2016 presidential campaign got underway, many voters clearly believed – not without reason – that the system was “rigged.”
另一个真相是由记者安娜·比康特（Anna Bikont）所考证的至少340位犹太男性、女性和儿童在耶德瓦布内（Jedwabne）被集体屠杀（有的作者认为这一数字高达1,600人 ） 。	Another is the massacre, examined by the journalist Anna Bikont, of at least 340 – and, according to other authors, as many as 1,600 – Jewish men, women, and children in the town of Jedwabne.
但是，据《金融时报 》 （ Financial Times）报道，一些欧盟国家对于出资仍“相当冷淡 ” 。	But, as the Financial Times reports, several EU countries’ willingness to come up with the money remains “lukewarm at best.”
20年来中国的差额一直维持在八个百分点，而新兴经济国家平均差额约为4 % ， 多数利率完全市场化的发达国家差额则近乎为零。	In the last 20 years, this gap has been eight percentage points for China, compared to roughly four percentage points on average for emerging economies and nearly zero for most developed economies, where interest rates are fully liberalized.
墨西哥城—总统涅托（Enrique Peña Nieto）不到两年，墨西哥实施了雄心勃勃的结构改革计划，旨在将墨西哥经济带出多年的低增长陷阱并为公民创造新机遇。	MEXICO CITY – Less than two years into Enrique Peña Nieto’s presidency, Mexico is implementing an ambitious structural-reform package designed to lift its economy out of a multi-decade low-growth trap and create new opportunities for its citizens.
但需要做更多的事帮助各国发展鲁棒的计划渠道以支持更强的公共投资项目，这是从私人部门吸引大量资源的关键。	But more must be done to enable countries to develop a robust project pipeline that supports a stronger public-investment program, which is critical to any strategy to attract substantial resources from the private sector.
安倍结合了潜力巨大的货币和财政刺激，并辅之以范围广泛的结构性改革，理应结束日本“失去的几十年 ” 。	Abenomics, with its potentially powerful combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus, coupled with a wide array of structural reforms, was supposed to end Japan’s “lost decades.”
2008年金融危机后，经济学家用“捕获”一词来形容监管者 — — 他们常常来自（或回到）他们的所谓监督对象 — — 如何无法对金融业进行合理的监督。	Economists used the term “capture” after the financial crisis of 2008 to describe how regulators, who often came from (and returned to) the industry they were supposed to oversee, failed to police the sector properly.
在高度相关的研究上的投资非常低：在美国，这方面的投资大约只占联邦在纳米技术的研究和开发上的11亿美元投资的1 % 。	Investment in highly relevant research was low: in the United States, it was only an estimated 1% of the $1.1 billion federal investment in nanotechnology research and development.
贸易和货币协议总算仍有达成，但越来越多地以地区或双边协议的形式达成，而非有利于范围更广的地缘政治目标的多边协定。	Trade and monetary agreements are still reached, but they increasingly take the form of regional and bilateral deals, rather than multilateral arrangements, thereby serving broader geopolitical goals.
中俄因势利导的联姻是否能产生一个持久的联盟 — — 或者如乔治·索罗斯（George Soros）预言的那样形成世界和平的威胁 — — 仍有待观察。	Whether their marriage of convenience will lead to an enduring union – or, as George Soros predicts, a threat to world peace – remains to be seen.
上两个月内，美国银行宣布斥资25亿美元购买中国建设银行9%的股份，新加坡控股公司淡马锡则宣布计划斥资14亿美元买进中国建设银行5.1%的股份。	During the past two months, Bank of America has announced a $2.5 billion investment in return for a 9% stake in the China Construction Bank, and The Singapore-based holding company Temasek paid $1.4bn for a 5.1% stake in China Construction Bank.
坚持相信改革派和强硬派只是同一个敌人的面具，并且因为后者的胜利而心生喜悦，这不仅仅是玩世不恭、犬儒主义，而且还是对一个已经蒙受羞辱的民族再施加额外的侮辱。	To persist in the belief that reformists and hardliners are just masks of the same enemy, and to take pleasure in the victory of the latter, is not merely cynical, but is an added insult to a people that has already been humiliated enough.
这将使俄罗斯无法再利用一个国家来压制另一个国家，因为提供给一国经销商的优惠将立即成为提供给所有其他国家的客户的优惠。	This would deprive Russia of its ability to play one country off against another, because a concession granted to one national distributor would immediately become available to customers in all the other countries.
首先，安纳托利亚（Anatolia）农民在大约10,000年前，让细菌去分解乳糖，将奶变为凝乳、奶酪和酸奶。	The first, invented by farmers in Anatolia about 10,000 years ago, is to allow bacteria to consume the lactose, turning milk into curd, cheese, and yoghurt.
事实上，完全不采用人工智能技术的企业可能因市场份额的丧失而面临20%左右的现金流下降，从而致使他们面临裁员的压力。	In fact, firms that do not adopt AI at all could experience a 20% decline in their cash flow as they lose market share, putting them under pressure to shed workers.
就连印刷足够数量的选票也不是个小任务，一个选区的一个政党的7—10名议会候选人可以组成一张拷贝（copy ） ， 每张拷贝有超过一百万选民的名字。	Even printing sufficient electoral rolls is no small task, given that each of a party’s 7-10 parliamentary candidates in a constituency is entitled to a copy, with each copy comprising the names of more than one million voters.
它们常常能获得贸易保护，比如进口关税和配额，以确保国内糖价大大高于澳大利亚、巴西、多米尼加、菲律宾和墨西哥等供给国。	They have often received trade protection, in the form of import tariffs and quotas, to ensure that domestic sugar prices far exceed those in supplier countries like Australia, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, and Mexico.
此外，教育体系应该注重鼓励加大对创新和冒险的开放程度 — — 这与公共部门卵翼下的体系所产生的态度截然不同。	Moreover, education systems should focus on encouraging greater openness to innovation and risk-taking – a significant departure from the attitudes reproduced under a system of public-sector patronage.
特朗普政府正在成为一个由错误地认为保护主义有助于经济的商人和目前主导着美国众议院共和党领导班子的市场原教旨主义者组成的联盟。	The Trump administration is taking shape as a coalition of businesspeople who wrongly believe that protectionism is a good way to help the economy and market fundamentalists who now dominate the Republican caucus in the US House of Representatives.
2008年危机后，许多国家表面上支持制定更严格的全球标准，实际上却在采取其他措施保护自己的金融系统。	Since the 2008 crisis, many countries, while ostensibly supporting the development of tighter global rules, have been taking other measures to protect their own financial systems.
我们希望你们刚刚度过了一个愉快的夏季休假，现在你们回到了华盛顿，不但身心放松，而且充满了能量，做好了处理我们国家的重重经济挑战的准备。	We hope that you had a good summer break, and that you return to Washington not just rested, but also energized to take on our country’s mounting economic challenges.
五年前，布什总统宣布伊拉克战争“使命胜利完成”时过于狂妄。 现在，他评价说“增兵”已经“在更为广泛的反恐战争中赢得了一场重要战略胜利”则是胡言乱语。	President George W. Bush’s declaration of “mission accomplished” in Iraq five years ago was as hubristic as his current assessment that the “surge” has “delivered a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror” is a fantasy.
尽管新一轮军备竞赛将对俄罗斯和其他国家构成严重威胁 — — 它也几乎可以肯定会使这个国家陷入毁灭，苏联最后一位领导人可以毋庸置疑地证明这一点。	While a new arms race would pose significant dangers for Russia – and for everyone else – it would also almost certainly bring the country to ruin, as the Soviet Union’s last leaders could no doubt attest.
事实上，目前人们预计2012年中国将无法达到其贸易增长10%的目标，尽管前九个月向新兴市场国家的出口增长超过了10 % 。	Indeed, China is now expected to undershoot its 10% growth target for trade in 2012, even though exports to emerging-market economies were up by more than that in the first nine months of the year.
事实上，欧元区成员国没有权利印刷本国钞票，这相当于把它们打到了与必须借入外币债务的欠发达国家相同的地位，风险溢价也因此加剧。	Indeed, as eurozone members’ inability to print their own money effectively relegated them to the status of less-developed countries that must borrow in a foreign currency, risk premiums widened accordingly.
而在其他对足球及其激起的情感感到恼火的人看来，这项运动已经不再是一种比赛，而是一种战争，一种能煽起最低级的民族主义情感的战争。	For others, exasperated by football and the emotions it stirs up, the sport is no longer a game, but a type of war that stokes the basest sort of nationalist emotions.
有些企业会倒闭；如果好运的话，有些公司会合并，比如那手握高端技术但不会做市场的公司会找到一些懂市场却不懂技术的公司。	Not all of them will survive; with luck, some of them may merge. Those with great technology and lousy marketing will find others with lousy technology and great marketing.
它必须重新设计其功能、结构和融资机制以促使其在从和平安全到可持续发展、人权和人道主义参与等职权范围内的各个领域取得可以衡量的结果。	It must urgently re-design its functions, structure, and finance mechanisms to maximize the delivery of measurable results in all areas within its purview, from peace and security to sustainable development, human rights, and humanitarian engagement.
但经济学和历史学告诉我们，今天的价格或许应该被视为更低的交易区间的顶部，油价可能一路探底，向20美元靠拢。	But economics and history suggest that today’s price should be viewed as a probable ceiling for a much lower trading range, which may stretch all the way down toward $20.
德国应该从自身在本世纪初的经验中认识到：供应端改革所带来的好处 — — 比如竞争力的提升以及更高的长期增长率 — — 都需要相当长的一段时间才能显现 。 。	As Germany knows from its own experience in the early 2000s, the benefits of supply-side reforms – namely, improved competitiveness and higher long-term growth rates – take a long time to emerge.
它们拥有用来投资于增强效率的方法和新生产系统的资本；它们也在利用日益普及的技术 — — 如数字工具、先进机器人或新材料 — — 来大幅推进效率。	They have the capital to invest in efficiency-enhancing approaches and new production systems, and they are making use of increasingly accessible technologies – such as digital tools, advanced robotics, or new materials – to turbo-charge efficiency.
类似地，印度研发的Embrace婴儿暖箱只需要200美元 — — 美国的传统保育箱成本高达2,000美元 — — 就可以让数百万体重不足产儿和早产儿获得救命设备。	Similarly, the Embrace infant warmer, developed in India, costs roughly $200 – compared to $2,000 for a conventional incubator in the US – giving millions of low-birth-weight and premature infants access to this life-saving resource.
事实上在一个开放的贸易体系中这种平衡极难实现，而尝试实现这一点实际上是有害的，因为它会折损通过贸易所获得的总体利益。	In fact, such balance is very difficult to achieve in an open trading system, and pursuing it would actually be damaging, as it would undermine the overall benefits gained through trade.
这一强烈的反应凸显出欧盟与以色列联系的极端重要性，也打破了美国式影响以色列政策的唯一外部行为人的长期观点。	This strong reaction reflects the profound importance of the EU’s ties with Israel, undercutting the long-held assumption that the US is the only outside actor that can influence Israeli policy.
十年之后回首这一危机，我们可以更为清晰地看到国际货币基金组织和美国财政部的判断、处方以及预测是多么错误。	Looking back at the crisis a decade later, we can see more clearly how wrong the diagnosis, prescription, and prognosis of the IMF and United States Treasury were.
据此，经验主义者笃定地认为，圣诞节，以及爆发式的礼物交换，是此前货币供给增加以及 — — 在其他条件不变的情况下 — — 需求减少的结果。	This perspective leads empiricists to the safe conclusion that Christmas, and a spurt in gift exchanges, is caused by a prior increase in the money supply and, ceteris paribus, a drop in savings.
如果每个人都只盯着自己的利益，那我们就将面临集体性危机 — — 看看当今应对全球气候问题时的乱象就知道了。	If we all think only of our own interests, we are headed for collective disaster – just look at what we are doing to our planet’s climate.
令人惊讶的是，这样的联盟十分稀少，许多小国 — — 特别是发展中小国 — — 致力于培养与“老大哥”国家的关系或者加入地区联邦结构。	Surprisingly, very few such alliances exist, with many small countries – especially developing ones – cultivating close ties with “big brother” countries or immersing themselves in regional federal structures.
土耳其人对叙利亚当局暴行的强烈反应其实就为以色列提供了一个机会，让它借机修复在封锁加沙前与土耳其总理埃尔多安的特殊关系。	The Turks’ appalled reaction to the Syrian regime’s brutal behavior creates an opportunity that Israel should use to try to restore the privileged relationship with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government that existed before the Gaza blockade.
一种令人似曾相识的说法是贫困国家不应使用肮脏的煤炭发电，相反，他们应当直接“跃升到”离网太阳能技术等更加清洁的能源。	A familiar refrain suggests that instead of dirty, coal-fired power plants, poor countries should “leapfrog” straight to cleaner energy sources like off-grid solar technology.
奥巴马总统的行政团队在2009年中把大部分时间都花在了一直困扰美国国内的政治斗争话题, 是否扩大医疗保险至上千万没有医疗保险的美国人 . 。	The difficulties that some Americans have with health-care reform tell us more about American hostility to government than it does about health care in general.
每一位领袖都在精心准备，生怕辩论场上的任何洋相令自己的党派丢掉大选，而是至今日，还没有谁干出些搬石头砸自己脚的蠢事。	Each leader has been carefully groomed to avoid the sort of gaffes that could cost his party the election, and thus far, not one has shot himself in the foot.
当然，也不能放弃财政谨慎；毕竟，如果政府或私人部门可以自由使用借来或新印出来的钱，结果肯定是更多的危机，而受危机冲击最大的正是穷人。	Of course, fiscal caution cannot be abandoned; after all, if governments or the private sector were to spend borrowed or newly minted money freely, the result would simply be more crises, which would hurt the poor most.
相形之下，包括新加坡岛在内的马来半岛在最早的华人和印度移民到来之前一直是马来人的国家（Tanah Melayu ） 。	In contrast, the Malay Peninsula, including the island of Singapore, was the land of the Malays (Tanah Melayu) before the first Chinese and Indian immigrants came and settled there.
在一段时间内，预计地中海仍将是主要安全挑战，因为它是非法移民进入欧洲的路径，并且与恐怖分子训练基地十分接近。	The Mediterranean can be expected to remain the main security challenge for some time, owing both to illegal immigration and its proximity to terrorist training grounds.
与此同时，欧元也在芬兰和意大利流通，前者高居创新及市场灵活性第二位，而后者却在这两方面无所作为，当之无愧地获得了 “ 欧洲病夫 ” 的称号。	It also became the currency of the Finns, runners-up in innovation and market flexibility, and of Italy, which lacked both, earning the apt moniker “the sick man of Europe.”
我听着他那些脏话、那些粗俗的豪言壮语，和他对女性的可悲的仇恨，根据当时的情绪，她将女性形容为婊子、蠢猪或恶心的动物。	I listen to his swearing, his vulgar rhetoric, his pathetic hatred of women, whom he describes, depending on his mood, as bitches, pigs, or disgusting animals.
第一个情景是悲观的：德国无法从社会和经济上融合难民，政治不满情绪飙升，新来者因为所受到的困境日益沮丧。	The first scenario is bleak: Germany fails to integrate the refugees socially and economically, political discontent surges, and the newcomers become increasingly frustrated with their plight.
当今许多战火不断的地区—包括阿富汗、埃塞俄比亚、伊朗、伊拉克、巴基斯坦、索马里和苏丹—都有着植根于它们冲突之中的基本问题。	Many of today’s war zones – including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Sudan – share basic problems that lie at the root of their conflicts.
因此，美国顶层10%和顶尖1%人群丝毫没有紧迫感 — — 从而也不会有压力要求出台措施让经济回到2008年前的增长路径 — — 也不难理解了。	So the absence of distress among America’s top 10% and its top 1% – and hence political pressure for measures to return the economy to its pre-2008 growth path – is understandable.
他希望这一制度强制要求承诺不但要接受对东道国很有用的移民，也要接受低技能和绝望移民，以此防止刺激人才流失。	He wants such a system to prevent encouraging a brain drain by enforcing a commitment to admitting low-skilled and desperate immigrants, not just those who are highly useful to the host country.
第二波始于1985年，当时出现了供应过剩，因为在经济危机之其间许多大宗商品出口国都想方设法去赚些硬通货。	The second wave, which began in 1985, reflected a supply glut, as many commodity exporters simultaneously sought to raise hard currency, often in the midst of economic crisis.
她的竞选还指望借用唐纳德·特朗普的力量来为她团结本党，这种情况是有可能发生的；但尤其在首次投票的年轻选民中她的工作可能会大打折扣，因为这些人都对桑德斯持压倒性的支持态度。	Her campaign is counting on Donald Trump to unite the party, and that might well happen; but she will have her work cut out, particularly among young and first-time voters, who have overwhelmingly backed Sanders.
是的，2013年对于公共部门决策来说绝不是好年份，特别是考虑到大部分公共决策问题都是“自摆乌龙 ” 。	Yes, 2013 was not a good year for public-sector decision-making, especially given that most of the slippages were “own goals.”
为减轻这一打击，政府迫切需要从技术和职业教育培训开始（TVET ） ， 推动劳动力市场改革并彻底改革教育体系。	To soften the blow, governments urgently need to pursue labor-market reforms and overhaul their education systems, starting with technical and vocational education and training (TVET).
菲永也是一位经济自由主义者 — — 常常被称为法国的玛格丽特·撒切尔 — — 而勒庞则是位保护主义者。	Fillon is also an economic liberal – and is often characterized as a French Margaret Thatcher – whereas Le Pen is a protectionist.
与一个优柔寡断的欧洲打交道所遭受的挫折感已导致土耳其的决策者们把他们的精力集中在预期投资回报率更直接也更具体的领域中去。	The frustrations of dealing with an undecided Europe have led Turkish policymakers to focus their efforts on an area where the expected return on their investment is more immediate and more concrete.
相反，他似乎更倾心于极权领导人 — — 特别是俄罗斯总统普京 — — 常常将民主国家领导人晾在一旁。	Instead, he seems drawn to authoritarian leaders – in particular, Russian President Vladimir Putin – and often leaves democratic leaders watching from the wings.
IMF所辨别的第二大挑战 — — 欧元区银行体系容量过剩及相关的不良贷款问题 — — 理论上也是可以解决的。	The second big challenge that the IMF identifies – excess capacity in the eurozone banking system, and the related problem of non-performing loans – is also, in principle, solvable.
我朋友的小女儿最近曾问有一天她会不会也像爷爷奶奶那样有“可以拿下来”的牙齿，我可以相对肯定的告诉她不会的。	My friend’s young daughter, who recently asked if she would ever have “in and out” teeth like her grandparents, can be relatively confident that she will not.
如果说加沙的景象在法国引起了极大共振，那么部分原因就在于惊人的数字：欧洲最大穆斯林社区遇上了欧洲最大犹太社区。	If the images from Gaza seem to resonate so much in France, it is partly a matter of sheer numbers: the largest Muslim community in Europe faces the largest Jewish community in Europe.
布拉格 — — 自从亚努科维奇赢得2010年总统大选后，乌克兰民主框架经历了一次具有警示意义的巨大动荡。	PRAGUE – Since the election of President Viktor Yanukovych in 2010, Ukraine has experienced a significant and alarming deterioration in its democratic framework.
人们可能因许多突发事件而陷入无家可归状态，包括收入不稳、遭到驱逐、刚刚出狱，家庭暴力，吸毒和精神健康问题。	People can be driven into homelessness by many contingencies, including income insecurity, eviction, transition from incarceration, domestic violence, drug abuse, and mental health issues.
相反，2011—2012年间，许多具系统重要性的欧洲银行都有风险暴露，这就提高了可能威胁到整个欧元区的多米诺效应的风险。	In 2010-2012, by contrast, systemically important European banks were exposed, raising the risk of a domino effect that threatened the entire eurozone.
尽管如此，风险分担仍不失为一个制��公平有效商业模式的不错起点 — — 这一模式可以随着时间推移逐步得到细化或简化。	Nevertheless, risk sharing is a good starting point from which to develop a fairer and more efficient business model – and one that can be refined or simplified over time.
在此环境下，购买 — — 甚至是持有具有风险的资产无疑是金融灾难的所在。 同样的，不论这个公司在市场上的股价过去是多么的“安全 ” ， 现在购买或是持有公司的股权都难以幸免于难。	The price system is saying: shut down risky production activities and don’t undertake any new activities that might be risky.
面对这些“叛逆 ” ， 欧盟唯一的手段是制裁 — — 这一临时性方案不足以制衡以否定共同欧盟规则为其政治平台基础的政府。	In the face of such noncompliance, the EU’s only recourse is sanctions – a temporary solution that is inadequate to keep in check governments that have based their political platforms on disavowing common EU rules.
其中一个挑战是朝鲜，其领导人金正恩在新年献词中宣布朝鲜已经造出可携带核弹头的洲际弹道导弹，并准备试射。	Among them will be North Korea, whose leader, Kim Jong-un, used his New Year’s Day address to announce that his country has built – and is prepared to test – an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
与中国和其他国家的贸易纠纷是晾出 — — 而不是镇压 — — 这些问题、进而向世界贸易机制民主化卖出重要一步的机会。	Trade disputes with China and other countries are an opportunity for airing – rather than repressing – these issues, and thus taking an important step toward democratizing the world’s trade regime.
它们更为重视对人力的投资，实行了创新性的项目来为本国人们带来医疗和信贷，并且建立社会基金来帮助发展地方社区。	They gave greater weight to investments in people, launching innovative initiatives to bring health care and access to finance to more of their citizens, and creating social funds to help develop local communities.
为了实现完全融合，穆斯林和其他欧洲各国的新移民不应被被视为“永久性访客 ” （ 甚至理想化地视为受到良好照顾的访客 ） ， 而应该像美国模式（或努力追求的）那样被视为家庭的真正成员。	To be fully integrated, Muslim and other newcomers to European countries must be welcomed not as perpetual visitors – even if, ideally, as nicely treated visitors – but rather as family members, as the American model does (or aspires to do).
南欧所急需的结构性改革是否可以取得政治和经济上的成功，取决于改革剂量是否合理以及预算药方是否及时、北欧需求是否坚挺。	The political and economic success of southern Europe’s much-needed structural reforms requires the proper dose and timing of budgetary medicine and buoyant demand in the north.
但许多媒体组织，包括两家大报《朝日新闻》和《每日新闻》持续报道着所谓的丑闻 — — 对八田和加户的证词只字不提，而对前川的指控长篇累牍地报道。	Yet many media organizations, including two leading newspapers, Asahi and Mainichi, continued to report on the supposed scandal – leaving out the testimony of Hatta and Kato, while providing an extensive account of Maekawa’s accusations.
尽管如此，早已习惯于65%以上支持率非国大党（主要凭借其解放者的威名实现）继续支持千夫所指、指控内容包括受贿和强奸等罪名的祖玛。	Regardless, the ANC, accustomed to winning well above 65% of the vote (mainly owing to its liberation credentials), continued to back the embattled Zuma, who faces accusations ranging from bribery to rape.
如果考虑减少温室气体排放或适应气候变化问题，则每年的基础设施需求成本还要在增加1,700—2,200亿美元。	Factoring in additional spending for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions or adapting to climate change could add $170-220 billion each year to the cost of these countries’ infrastructure needs.
当公众对普京吞并克里米亚之举的支持逐渐退去 — — 这是迟早的事 — — 他的失败在MH17航班坠毁事件面前更加显露无疑了。	When public support for Putin’s annexation of Crimea wanes – as it will – his failings will shine more starkly in the light of the MH17 catastrophe.
10月，俄石油发行了价值110亿美元的卢布计价债券（这在俄罗斯市场上是前所未有的，这次发行相当于俄罗斯今年公司债券发行总量的70 % ） 。	In October, Rosneft issued $11 billion worth of ruble-denominated bonds (an unparalleled amount for the Russian market, equivalent to 70% of the total value of corporate bonds issued in Russia this year).
到了12月11日，人们在施维利多夫遇害地点又发动了另一场示威，并游行到莫斯科市核心区域，与克里姆林宫仅一墙之隔的涅什纳亚广场。	On December 11, another rally was held at site of the murder, and moved into the very center of Moscow, Manezhnaya Square, just outside the Kremlin’s walls.
因此，安全措施应该首先在北约-欧盟框架内进行双边讨论，在此基础上形成一个OSCE共同立场。 以一个声音与俄罗斯对话至关重要。	Given that Russia’s own new military doctrine presents NATO as a potential threat, its leaders can logically claim that NATO enlargement undermines Russian security.
面对着费卢杰或纳杰夫城所看到的严重暴力，没有一部强加的宪法能够对联军有所帮助，不管它看上去多么正义凛然。	No imposed constitution, however elegant it may be, will be very helpful to Coalition forces when confronted with the type of mayhem seen in towns like Fallujah or Najjaf.
最近，中国私人汽车制造商吉利收购沃尔沃汽车的事街知巷闻，但这笔收购的款项绝��部分由地方市政府筹集的事实却鲜为人知。	The recent purchase of Volvo by the private Chinese automaker Geely generated much publicity, but most of the money was put up by municipal governments.
但最近的风波与其他与美国相关的当前外交危机一样，反映了一个更加根本的问题：美国外交政策缺少战略眼光。	But the current firestorm, like other recent diplomatic crises for the United States, reflects a more fundamental problem: the lack of strategic vision in American foreign policy.
但《增长的极限》的基本思想仍然成立：我们继续着一种趋势，纠结于对细枝末节问题的误导性解决，而忽视大问题和明智的解决。	But the report’s fundamental legacy remains: we have inherited a tendency to obsess over misguided remedies for largely trivial problems, while often ignoring big problems and sensible remedies.
欧洲已经面临许多重大挑战，包括俄罗斯入侵乌克兰、英国脱欧、民粹主义和民族主义的兴起以及低迷的经济增长速度。	And Europe is already confronting many significant challenges, including Russian aggression against Ukraine, Brexit, the rise of populism and nationalism, and low rates of economic growth.
同时以往大多数经济衰退所表现出的更快更强劲的复苏也反映了美联储大幅降低了短期利率的积极反周期货币政策。	The faster and more robust recoveries that characterized most previous recessions reflected aggressive countercyclical monetary policy by the Fed, which cut the short-term interest rate very sharply.
没人提到在压力下出售“金融产品 ” — —即使这些产品并不符合贷款人的最佳利益 — — 并急于和贷款人签约的银行经理。	No one talks of the bank manager, under pressure to sell “financial products” and eager to sign up customers, even if the products were not in a customer’s best interest.
事实上，由于中国对巴基斯坦和阿富汗的影响力不断增长，上述外交创举可能被证明是对中国如何看待中印关系的关键测试。	Indeed, given China’s growing influence in Pakistan and Afghanistan, this act of diplomatic creation could prove to be a key test of how China views its relations with India.
全球大约8亿人难以获得紧急服务，并且这一状况在可预见的未来难以改变，因为没有足够的钱修��连同他们。	Some 800 million people around the world have limited access to emergency services, and that will not change in the foreseeable future, because there will not be enough money to build roads to connect them.
奥巴马执政期间，共和党开始认识到，仅仅要求取消奥巴马医保是不够的，他们的口风也变为要“取消并取代 ” 。	Over Obama’s tenure, Republicans came to realize that it was no longer sufficient simply to call for a repeal of Obamacare, and their rhetoric shifted to the need to “repeal and replace.”
欧洲目前绝大多数动荡令人联想起1790年埃德蒙·伯克驳斥法国大革命，将其称之为藐视民众对历史和传统依恋之情的被误导的信仰产物。	Much of the current upheaval in Europe evokes Edmund Burke’s repudiation in 1790 of the French Revolution as the product of a misguided faith in ideas that defied people’s attachment to history and tradition.
欧洲央行坚持“自愿”重组 — — 也就是说，避免了信用事件的发生 — — 无异于站到了债权人的对立面。	The ECB’s insistence on “voluntary” restructuring – that is, avoidance of a credit event – has placed the two sides at loggerheads.
这一复杂因果关系系统的等级结构诱使我们感觉具有高水平的理解，而这又使得较低水平的理解被误解为较高水平。	This hierarchical structure of complex causal systems seduces us into a sense of understanding at a high level, which is then mistaken for having an understanding at a lower level.
对此意大利就是个富有启发性的例子：意大利的高层政策制定者使用了“人肉海啸”这个不太友善的词来警告可能出现的难民大规模涌入。	The case of Italy is instructive: “human tsunami” is the unfortunate phrase used by senior policymakers to warn against the possible flood of migrants.
就个人而言，我可能会倾向于等待时间较长的一方，并接受如果通胀最终上升，它会迅速行动，以一个陡峭曲线大幅加息的极高风险。	Personally, I would probably err on the side of waiting longer and accept the very high risk that, when inflation does rise, it will do so briskly, requiring a steeper path of interest-rate hikes later.
对于美国卷入酷刑丑闻，伊拉克拥有大规模杀伤性武器以及伊与基地组织有关联的误传等问题，海外的美国民众可能要比那些投票给布什的民众更感到气愤。	Those who voted for Bush may not be as outraged by American involvement in torture, or the misleading information about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and connections with Al Qaeda, as those abroad.
如果法国或意大利人20世纪90年代50多岁时就可以退休，享受最终薪水的80%甚至更多，那他们又为什么要在60多岁时继续工作？	Why should a Frenchman or Italian in his early sixties work today, when in the 1990's he could have retired in his mid-fifties with 80% or more of his last working-age salary?
而移民专家（比如我）从20世纪70年代便开始建议应该发展相应的机制方便学术人才回国举办培训班，培养本土符合国际最高标准的师资。	And immigration experts like me have proposed since the 1970’s that schemes be developed to enable the academic diaspora to run workshops aimed at bringing teachers up to the best international standards.
我的伯克利同事卡里斯蒂娜·罗默和大卫·罗默（Christina and David Romer）指出，如果一国已经积累了很高的公共债务，那么财政政策在抵御衰退方面效果较低，采用的可能性也较小。	As my Berkeley colleagues Christina and David Romer have shown, fiscal policy is less effective in countering recessions, and less likely to be used, when a country has already incurred a high public debt.
但尽管传闻有退休老领导反对习近平，但他不太可能被推翻，因为他仍然牢牢掌控着中国这个党化国家的安全机构和军队。	Yet, despite rumors of pushback against his power by retired elderly leaders, Xi is unlikely to be overthrown. He remains solidly in control of the Chinese party-state’s security apparatus and the military.
毕竟，在自由派卢武铉担任总统期间，韩国完成了美韩自由贸易协定、允许美国重新在韩国境内驻军，并派出韩军在伊拉克与美国并肩作战。	After all, it was during the liberal Roh presidency that South Korea concluded the South Korea-US Free Trade Agreement, allowed for US troops to be redeployed within its borders, and dispatched its own troops to fight alongside the US in Iraq.
纽约 — — 西方与俄罗斯的关系很少比现在还差，俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京干预乌克兰及吞并克里米亚造成了现在这种局面。	NEW YORK – Western relations with Russia have rarely been worse than they are now, in the aftermath of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intervention in Ukraine and decision to annex Crimea.
剧中的英雄，杰克·苏利在此前一次为美国执行的战斗中残废了，但他的国家却并未因此给予其应有的照顾；而如果他能够很好地完成交给他的种族大屠杀任务的话，那么“公司”就会好好奖励他一番，给予他所需的治疗。	The hero, Jake Sully, is crippled from combat in a previous American conflict, but is not well cared for by his own country; if he does his job of genocide properly, “the corporation” will reward him with proper medical treatment.
由于死牛气田的天然气远远超过了阿根廷本国的需求量，出口将是不可避免的，��相邻的巴西和智利则是天然客户。	Because Vaca Muerta holds much more gas than Argentina could ever burn, exports are the inescapable way forward, and neighboring Brazil and Chile are among the natural customers.
该国的选举规则已经进行过改革，从而为比例代表制增添了某种多数主义元素，目的是鼓励主流政党之间建立选前联盟。	The country’s electoral rules had been reformed to add a majoritarian element to its proportional representation system, the goal being to encourage pre-election coalition building among mainstream parties.
讽刺之处是，中国的立场可能带来一个悲剧，放任朝鲜增加和提升其核和导弹武器可能加速奔向战争，或导致韩国、日本或两国均重新考虑无核立场。	The irony and potential tragedy of China’s position is that allowing North Korea to increase and improve its nuclear and missile arsenals could fuel momentum toward war, or lead South Korea, Japan, or both to reconsider their non-nuclear postures.
但尽管美联储实施积极货币宽松的许诺非常引人注目，但此举对实体经济和美股的影响可能比前两轮的都要更小也更短暂。	But, despite the Fed’s impressive commitment to aggressive monetary easing, its effects on the real economy and on US equities could well be smaller and more fleeting than those of previous QE rounds.
总统去除了传统的制衡就从来不必为其政策提供连贯的理由，如果是这样，那么，就会马上不会为其政策提供什么一贯的理由了。	A presidency that, having dismantled traditional checks and balances, is never compelled to provide coherent reasons for its policies, is soon likely to have few coherent reasons for its policies.
大卫·戴维斯（David Davis）是一位支持退欧的保守党，他目前主持着英国的退欧谈判。 他曾经说 ， “ 如果民主不能改变思维，那么它就不再是民主 。 ”	David Davis, the pro-Brexit Tory who is now leading the UK’s Brexit negotiations, once said that, “If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.”
大部分国家都存在类似的在税务上优惠债务而不利于股本的情况，这鼓励金融业和其他公司更多地使用债务，这是财务分析师早就知道的事情。	Most countries have similar tax preferences for debt over equity, thereby encouraging financial and other corporations to use more debt, as financial analysts have long known.
"然而，在这两个进程中，相关国家在起初的财政改善之后，都明显地表现出政治""疲惫""的迹象：在欧元区 ， 《 稳定协议》发生了聚变；在整个东欧，财政预算赤字开始上升。"	"In both cases, however, after initial progress, countries have shown clear signs of political ""fatigue"": in the euro area, the Stability Pact has imploded; throughout Eastern Europe, budget deficits have started to rise."
而后的6月，就在俄罗斯主办的世界杯开始举行之际，政府提议将男性的退休年龄从60延迟到65岁，而将女性退休年龄从55延迟到63岁，从而即刻引发了公众的反对。	Then, in June, just as the Russia-hosted World Cup was getting underway, the government proposed increasing the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 63 for women, prompting an immediate public backlash.
4月初，日本央行宣布了最激进的债券购买计划，承诺在未来两年中向经济注入1.4万亿美元以实现2%的目标通胀率。	In early April, the BOJ announced plans to unleash the most aggressive bond-buying program of all, promising to inject $1.4 trillion into the economy over the next two years in order to meet an inflation target of 2%.
美国在19世纪40年代和50年代出现了上述问题，当时独立联盟的必要性已逐渐减退，于是重新出现了之前被掩盖的冲突和问题。	For the US, those questions arose in the 1840s and 1850s, when the urgent need for a union to secure independence had faded, causing issues and conflicts that had been papered over to resurface.
克林顿和布莱尔 — — 继奇怪的盎格鲁-美利坚组合里根和撒切尔夫人之后，这一对组合开始撕扯社会民主派的纹理 — — 达成了艾德礼想都不敢想的妥协。	Clinton and Blair – who came to power after that other odd Anglo-American couple, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, had started to tear at the fabric of social democracy – made compromises of which Attlee would not have dreamed.
一项估计表明，ESG基金投资呈现出爆炸式增长，从2007年的2,020亿美元增加到2014年的4.3万亿美元。	By one estimate, investment in ESG funds has exploded, from $202 billion in 2007 to $4.3 trillion in 2014.
每次执行完命令后，刺客经常在当地民众的众目睽睽下原地不动静候被捕，以确保他们的领袖因刺杀行动而收获荣誉。	After carrying out their orders, the assassins often stayed put and awaited capture in full view of the local populace, to ensure that their leader received proper credit for the act.
开始时，所有欧洲国家可能都认为：那些非欧洲的外来者应该完全融入欧洲的文化，就像19世纪的波兰移民融入到德国鲁尔地区的文化当中一样。	All European countries probably believed at the outset that non-European newcomers could be assimilated in the same way that Polish immigrants were assimilated into Germany’s Ruhr region in the nineteenth century.
而且，战争的疯狂已经清楚地向所有人展现出来。 一旦目前的战斗结束，双方现在都将在可能把它们的人民和国家再一次推向战争的行动中小心谨慎。	Moreover, the madness of war has been clearly demonstrated to all, and, once the current fighting is over, both sides are now more likely to be cautious about actions that might push their peoples and countries into war once more.
因为大规模风暴频繁发生，全球政府的应对举措是升级早期预警系统、改良疏散计划以及出台更积极的避难措施。	With big storms occurring more frequently, authorities worldwide are responding with upgraded early-warning systems, better evacuation plans, and more aggressive sheltering strategies.
在他们看来，土耳其重新将外交政策的重点定位在中东穆斯林地区并逐渐远离西方 — — 据信该国对以色列关系恶化以及对伊朗，叙利亚关系的改善正好反映了这一转变。	In their view, Turkey had re-oriented its foreign policy toward the Muslim Middle East and away from the West – a shift supposedly reflected in the country’s deteriorating relations with Israel and improving ties with Iran and Syria.
如果能够提升金融知识水平，女性就能获得土地和信用等资源，这些工具是商业发展、社会流动性和个人成长的关键。	If financial literacy levels can be raised, women can access resources such as land and credit, tools that hold the keys to business development, social mobility, and personal growth.
它把参与者驱赶到对立的角落，导致他们不可避免地发生冲突 — — 我们应该不惜一切代价避免这样的后果。	It drives participants into opposite corners, setting them up for conflict – an outcome that should be avoided at all costs.
当政客不得不在社会和衣食父母之间做出选择时，他们极有可能会放任社会紧张发展 — — 即使到达了危险水平 — — 而不愿牺牲自身权力基础。	When forced to choose between their societies and their clientele, politicians may well decide that allowing social tensions to rise – even to dangerous levels – is better than sacrificing their own power bases.
新的位于北京的亚洲基础设施投资银行（Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank）将帮助亚洲地区的基础设施（公路、电力、铁路等）提供融资。	A new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to be based in Beijing, will help to fund infrastructure projects (roads, power, and rail, among others) throughout the region.
例如，位于中部的甘肃省与中国其他大多数地方一样正在应付结构性和社会问题，这些问题有的很棘手，有的难以克服。	For example, like much of the country, Gansu Province, at China’s geographical center, is grappling with structural and social problems that range from the daunting to the apparently insuperable.
未来避免这些问题，必须帮助全球的农民和粮食加工厂商生产更多的粮食来满足由于世界人口和收入增加而引起的日益增长的需求。	To avoid these shortcomings in the future, the world’s farmers and food processors must be helped to produce more food to meet increasing demand fueled by growth in world population and incomes.
意大利人可能会想，为什么不在这些行业纷纷倒闭或最终落入外国人手中 — — 这种状况现在已经在发生了 — — 之前脱离欧元？	Italians might be tempted to think: Why not escape the euro before those industries fold or end up in foreign hands, as is already happening?
普京政权的首席意识形态官员巴普洛夫斯基说，俄国目前的体制除了不知道其敌人是谁意外在各方面都完美无缺。	According to Gleb Pavlovsky, the Putin regime’s leading ideologist, the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one: it doesn’t know its enemies.
沃尔克的胜利在立法和实践上都得到了制度化，从而使央行获得了更大的自治权，在某些情况下，在长期存在的政治约束之下获得了正式的独立地位。	Volcker’s victory was institutionalized in legislation and practices that granted central banks greater autonomy and, in some cases, formal independence from long-standing political constraints.
身为同性恋让我能够更深地理解这对少数群体意味着什么，也为我提供了一个窗口一窥其他少数群体在应对日常生活中的挑战 。 ”	Being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day.”
然而在英美两国先后几轮量化宽松政策中展现出的事实表明虽然债券收益确实有所降低，但额外加印的货币很大程度上还滞留在银行系统，从未流入实体经济。	But the evidence emerging from successive rounds of QE in the UK and the US suggests that while it did lower bond yields, the extra money was largely retained within the banking system, and never reached the real economy.
但是，尽管这种增长不太可能很快会停滞，俄罗斯的经济成功已经越来越依赖于石油和天然气价格依然保持在高位并且还要继续上涨。	But, while growth is not likely to stop any time soon, Russia’s economic success increasingly hinges not only on high but rising oil and gas prices.
要使美日联盟持续下去，必须改变目前这种处理安排 — — 这是战后由美国主导占领而引起的遗留问题，它受到了胜者-失败者心态的影响。	This arrangement – a legacy of the post-war US-led occupation, which was underpinned by a victor-loser mentality – must be changed to make the alliance sustainable.
到2050年，我们必须在让能源相关排放在2010年水平的基础上减少70 % ， 而要实现2060年净零排放，则需要进一步减少。	But by 2050, we must reduce energy-related emissions by 70% from 2010 levels, with further cuts needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2060.
他径直飞去了利雅得，在那里和54个穆斯林多数国家召开峰会，发表了一篇诋毁伊朗的煽动性演说，说国际社会应该对伊朗唯恐避之不及。	He made a beeline to Riyadh, where he participated in a summit with 54 Muslim-majority countries and delivered an inflammatory speech vilifying Iran, which he asserted should be shunned by the international community.
她也向那些窃取选票的人发出了一个明确无误的信号：最糟糕的结果也不过是与反对派分享几个内阁的职位而已。	She also sent an unmistakable signal to those who would steal votes: at worst, they might have to share a few cabinet positions with the opposition.
事实上，人们越来越清楚地认识到中国开放经济的目的不过是保持国内过度强大的执政统治，而并不是要尊重和改善普通中国人的生活。	Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that China opened its economy only to maintain the country’s over-mighty rulers in power, not to respect and enhance the lives of ordinary Chinese.
然而由于进口增长下滑并未引发混乱，当中国对欧出口骤降之时，中国2011年的以GDP计算的经常账户盈余进一步下跌。	But, because the fall in import growth had yet to turn into a rout, while China’s exports to Europe plummeted, China’s current-account surplus fell further in GDP terms in 2011.
伦敦—我最近和爱尔兰总统希金斯碰了面，他在一个场合演讲时把他新提出的“伦理计划 ” （ ethics initiative）与我和犬子合著的《多少才够？ 钱和好生活 》 （ How Much is Enough?	LONDON – When I recently met Irish President Michael Higgins – sharing a platform for a speech in which he connected his newly launched “ethics initiative” to a book I co-wrote with my son, How Much is Enough?
新的欧洲条约不会让万事上选，但可以给每个成员国带来加入的机会或承诺加入在政治上更加一体化的欧元区，要么加入更少一体化的第二集团。	A new European treaty would not allow cherry-picking, but would give each member state a chance to join, or commit to, either the politically more integrated eurozone or the less integrated second group.
但一个麻烦的因素仍然存在：双面劳动力市场的出现，低薪临时工人难以跳出不充分的工作条件，进入主流劳动力市场。	But one troubling factor remains: the emergence of a dual labor market, in which low-wage and temporary workers find it hard to transfer out of inadequate working conditions into the mainstream labor market.
中国人吸取了日本的教训 — — 特别是日本屈服于1985年广场协议让日元剧烈升值所带来的灾难性影响 — — 选择了逐步升值之路。	Mindful of the lessons of Japan – especially its disastrous concession on sharp yen appreciation in the Plaza Accord of 1985 – the Chinese have opted, instead, for a gradual revaluation.
此外，在以妨碍信息获得而使谷歌遭受非议的国家里，当某些信息被封锁时，谷歌会指出这些信息的缺失 ， - 谷歌要让人们知道，此信息是存在的但他们无法获得它。	Moreover, in countries where Google is criticized for blocking access to information, it points out the information’s absence when something is blocked – letting people know that it exists but that they can’t have access to it.
在欧洲货币联盟内部几个国家中广泛传播的违约将会导致欧盟内部严重的贸易混乱，还将导致那些被迫降低所持政府债券的帐面价值的银行系统出现新的问题。	A widespread default of several countries in EMU would lead to serious disruptions of trade within the EU and to new problems in the banking system, which would have to write down their holdings of government bonds.
当西方还在疲于应付突尼斯，摩洛哥以及埃及改革派伊斯兰主义者的迅速崛起之际，巴勒斯坦地区哈马斯的角色冲突问题也日渐升温。	As the West grapples with the rapid rise of moderate Islamists in Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt, the issue of Hamas’s role in the Palestinian territories looms large.
在临刑前，贝•布托被允许见父亲最后一面。 她在自传中写道 ： “ 我在他的死囚牢房里发誓，我将继续他的事业 。 ”	Hours before his hanging, Benazir was allowed to see her father for the last time, writing in her autobiography: “I told him on my oath in his death cell, I would carry on his work.”
只要巴基斯坦政府和人民能继续支持关键性疫苗，我有信心当我下一次回到家乡时，我对祖国儿童未来感到乐观的理由会更加充足。	With continued support for vital vaccines from Pakistan’s government and people, I am hopeful that the next time I return home, there will be even more reasons to be optimistic about our children’s future.
许多年来，精神病医生兼自杀研究专家赫尔伯特·恩丁（Herbert Hendin）一直声称这些法律中所包含的保护措施未能保护那些易受害人群。	For many years, Herbert Hendin, a psychiatrist and suicide expert, has asserted that the safeguards incorporated in these laws fail to protect the vulnerable.
此外，为人们认为有价值的东西付费能有助于实现其价值，就像将会员模式置于纯交易模式之上的举动所表明的那样。	Moreover, paying for something that one perceives as valuable helps make it so, as the move to prioritize membership models over purely transactional approaches illustrates.
候选人表现如何，也不会根据其观点是否具有实质内容决定，而是根据其演说、其肢体语言、其面部表情、其不经意的叹息、微笑、冷嘲和无意中的眼部动作决定。	And the candidates’ performances are scrutinized less on the substance of their arguments than on their presentation, body language, facial tics, unguarded sighs, smiles, sneers, and inadvertent eye rolling.
和巴勒斯坦类似，摩洛伊斯兰解放阵线因派系斗争而四分五裂，其领导人不可能或不愿意将这些恐怖分子从自己控制的地区驱逐出去。	Like the Palestinians, however, the MILF is riven by factions, and its leaders cannot, or will not, exclude terrorists from areas that they control.
日本是习惯遮遮掩掩的社会，每个成员都必须猜测到底发生了什么，媒体也小心翼翼地避免引发社会成员的对立。	Japan is a hush-hush society, where everyone is supposed to guess what is going on, and the media are careful not to provoke social division.
罗姆尼的预算计划还将破坏联邦税收-转移系统的累进性，从而恶化已经处于大萧条以来最严重水平的收入不平等。	Romney’s budget plan would also make the federal tax-and-transfer system considerably less progressive, thereby worsening income inequality, which is already at its highest level since the Great Depression.
如果你询问一国两制模式的设计师邓小平香港回归20周年纪念日应当是什么样子，他可能会说香港居民会为了繁荣和自由而举杯庆贺。	If you had asked Deng Xiaoping, the architect of the “one country, two systems” model, what the handover’s 20th anniversary would look like, he might have said that Hong Kong’s residents would be toasting to their prosperity and liberty.
但是如今，每个马来西亚人都必须申报宗教归属并在政府登记。 这一要求使得穆斯林在不通过法律手续完成现状的改变而脱离伊斯兰非常困难。	Today, however, every Malaysian must declare a religious affiliation, which is registered with the government – a requirement that has made it difficult for a Muslim to leave Islam without formalizing the change of status through the legal process.
但这些支持的产生原因是他们目睹略低于自己的阶级陷入绝望和憎恨，而他们自己的孩子们前景黯淡，这引起了他们的担忧。	But much of that support rode on the coattails of the fear caused by observing the classes just below theirs plunge into despair and loathing, while their own children’s prospects dimmed.
风险共担便利能够限制危机后的世纪增长下跌幅度，与此同时，及时的欧盟融资投资项目能够防止防止一国向更低的增长路径迁移。	A risk-sharing facility could limit the decline in actual growth after a crisis, while prompt EU-financed investment would prevent a country from shifting to a lower growth path.
如果欧盟生产某种产品因能源因素导致成本过大，这种产品很可能被转到其他能源便宜的地方生产，之后再进口回欧洲。	If making a product in the EU costs more because of higher energy costs, the product will likely be made somewhere else, where energy is cheaper, and then imported into the EU.
这一协定规定了对以往各种袭击的受害者的赔偿程序，赔偿范围涵盖了从1988年泛美103航班在苏格兰小镇洛克比遇袭到1986年美国对利比亚城市的黎波里和班加西的空袭的受害者。	The agreement provides a process for compensating the victims of attacks ranging from the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, to the US air strikes on Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986.
虽然他们承认低社会流动性是源自于经济上的限制因素，但他们仍然跟被分享数据前一样反对政府干预和再分配。	While they acknowledged that low social mobility is economically limiting, they remained as averse to government intervention and redistribution as they were before we shared the data with them.
中国可以通过增强巴基斯坦军队更大规模扫荡本国塔利班极端分子的决心；开放边境地区来协助阿富汗北约部队补给；以及投资阿富汗国内基础设施的方式来提供帮助。	China can help by stiffening the resolve of Pakistan’s military to move more aggressively to contain Taliban extremists on its territory; open border regions to help resupply NATO forces in Afghanistan; and invest in the country’s infrastructure.
俄日之间也没有和平条约，两国在千岛群岛（日本称北方列岛）存在主权争议，中国和印度之间也存在边界之争。	There is no Russia-Japan peace treaty, and the two countries have competing claims over the Kuril Islands (known as the Northern Territories to the Japanese). The border between China and India is also a matter of contention.
但真相是它其实比以往任何时候都更加紧迫，不仅是为了遏制涌向欧洲和其他地区的难民流，也是为了阻止恐怖分子的招募工作。	But the truth is that it is more urgent than ever, not just to check the flows of refugees to Europe and elsewhere, but also to undermine terrorist recruitment efforts.
"可以肯定，多数税收会带来沉重的""额外负担 "" 。 税收成本远较收入价值为高，因为潜在的纳税者会想出种种办法来进行逃避。"	"To be sure, most taxes entail heavy ""excess burdens"": the cost is significantly greater than the value of the revenue raised because of potential taxpayers' myriad attempts at evasion and avoidance."
我以前的一个学生，也是个这样的受害者，有一天给我电话问道 ， “ 我现在到底该怎么办，找一份真正的工作 ？ ”	One such victim, a former student, called me the other day and asked, “What am I supposed to do now, get a real job?”
在七月，执政的正义与发展党(AKP ) — 一个宗教上保守但经济上却开明的政党—在国会选举中获得了压倒性的胜利。 这次选举是在军方企图阻挠居尔成为总统之后进行的。	In July, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) – religiously conservative but economically liberal – won a landslide in parliamentary elections called after the military balked at seeing Gül become president.
在第一项研究中，尼日利亚、加纳和肯尼亚的大部分中等收入个人被调查者计划在未来五年增加孩子教育的投入，尽管他们本身只有20%完成了最低限度教育。	In the first study, most of the middle-income individuals surveyed in Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya plan to spend more on their children’s education in the next five years, even though up to 20% of them had minimal education themselves.
找到恰当的改革组合或许将不可避免的需要进行某些试验，此外还需要认真监测结果，以便能够进行必要的调整。	Finding the right combination of reforms would inevitably require some experimentation, as well as the careful monitoring of outcomes, so that necessary adjustments could be made.
从1992到2011年，意大利的劳动生产率每年平均只增长0.9 % ， 在经合组织成员国中倒数第一。	From 1992 to 2011, labor productivity grew at an average annual rate of 0.9%, the lowest in the OECD.
在山脚下，紧挨着条件恶劣的半露天厕所的地方住着“非洲人 ” ， 他们的帐篷时不时会承接山上掉下来的秽物。	At the foot of the slope, just next to the appalling semi-open-air toilets, were the “Africans,” amidst whose tents runs filth from up the slope.
这大概也是谷歌能赚那么多钱的原因，虽然我一直难以相信作为身为一个勤奋而幸福的互联网用户自己所得到的巨大好处竟然是由本人相当稀少的互联网购买行为所支撑的。	This is supposedly what makes Google so profitable, though I have trouble believing that the enormous benefits I receive as an assiduous and happy user are paid for by my rather infrequent Internet purchases.
朝鲜奥运选手和拉拉队员在乘火车抵达韩国时无疑将会得到热烈的欢迎，而在两国运动员举着同一面旗帜步入体育场时将面对人们的热烈欢呼。	North Korea’s Olympians and cheerleaders will undoubtedly be greeted enthusiastically when they arrive by train in the South, and the crowd will roar its approval when athletes from the two countries march into the stadium under the same banner.
其作为后藤的交换条件要求释放的囚犯是雷莎维（Sajida al-Rishawi ） ， 她因为2005年安曼饭店爆炸事件而在约旦面临死刑。	The prisoner whose release it has demanded in exchange for Goto is Sajida al-Rishawi, who faces the death penalty in Jordan for her role in hotel bombings in Amman in 2005.
但是，对记者的身体攻击之肆无忌惮固然令人恐惧 — — 其中大约又要数卡绍吉案最为骇人听闻 — — 记者这个行业所面临的最大危险要比身体攻击平凡得多。	But while physical attacks on journalists have become frighteningly bold – and Khashoggi’s killing may be the most audacious yet – most dangers confronting the profession are much more mundane.
印度可能、也可能不会是下一个世界经济奇迹，但如果印度要想成为大多数市民的良好居住地，它必须解决它长年积存的问题，以及它的新问题。	India may or may not be the world's next economic wonder; but it will have to solve its age-old problems, as well as its new ones, if it is going to be a good place to live for the vast majority of its citizens.
如果你以公正的态度审视默克尔-马克龙的梅瑟堡峰会，就会发现欧元区仍和五年前一样具有宏观经济不可持续性。	And an impartial observer of the Merkel-Macron Meseberg Summit would conclude that the eurozone remains as macroeconomically unsustainable as it was five years ago.
从这个角度讲，听到我们与黑猩猩无甚差别（我们天生注定有侵略性、也拥有类人猿的所有特征 ） 、 或者猩猩也有人权之类的结论也不足为怪。	From there, it is not uncommon to hear the conclusion that we are ”nothing but” chimpanzees (and fated to be aggressive, or to possess whatever attributes are being imputed to apes these days), or that apes merit human rights.
亚洲还需需要进一步改善高等教育质量，实施课程改革以确保年轻人获得为进入劳动力市场做好准备所需要的知识和技能。	Asia needs to improve further the quality of its higher education as well, reforming curricula to ensure that young people are getting the knowledge and skills they need to prepare them for the labor market.
如果拉美一直将20%左右的国民收入用于投资，而亚洲这一比例接近30 % — —包括对教育的投资 — — 那么新兴亚洲的趋同速度将显著快于拉美。	If Latin America invests around 20% of its national income in a sustained manner, while emerging Asia invests close to 30% – including investments in education – emerging Asia will converge significantly more rapidly.
欧元区整体实际（经通胀调整的）人均收入在2007年水平徘徊；希腊和意大利分别下降到2000年和1997年水平。	Real (inflation-adjusted) per capita income in the eurozone as a whole hovers around its 2007 level; in Greece and Italy, however, it has sunk to the levels recorded in 2000 and 1997, respectively.
韩国拥有万亿美元规模的经济、世界级的技术、500,000大军和充满活力、教育程度优良的社会，它有能力计划、操作和提供资金以实现金氏王朝的和平下台。	With a trillion-dollar economy, world-class technology, a 500,000-strong military, and a vibrant, well-educated society, the country is capable of planning, manning, and paying for the aftermath of a peaceful end to the Kim regime.
许多重要发现都是意外的结果：研究者发现了一些并非他们寻找目标的意外的东西，但马上认识到这些发现的重要性。	Many important discoveries are a result of serendipity: researchers find something unexpected that they were not looking for, but which they quickly recognize as significant.
最糟糕的结果是选出一位与格林斯潘倾向相同的美联储主席 — — 紧紧地抓住数据，垄断决策，并试图威吓同���。	The worst possible outcome would be to pick someone who shares Greenspan’s inclinations – holding data tightly, monopolizing decision-making, and attempting to overawe colleagues.
第三，财政悬崖将对2013年GDP形成4.5%的拖累作用，如果减税和转移支付到期停止且严厉的支出削减被触发的话。	Third, the fiscal cliff would amount to a 4.5%-of-GDP drag on growth in 2013 if all tax cuts and transfer payments were allowed to expire and draconian spending cuts were triggered.
许多新兴市场也将想要介入反周期的宏观经济政策，但对财政的连续性的担心和对大幅度通货膨胀的恐惧，使他们被捆住了手脚。	Many emerging markets will also want to engage in countercyclical macroeconomic policy, but they are hemmed in by concerns of fiscal sustainability and fear of rampant inflation.
直到死亡令他们沉默，萨特和阿隆都更多地因他们在作品中展现的鲜明的态度被人们纪念，至于他们事实上提倡的东西大家似乎并不太在意。	Silenced by death, Sartre and Aron are remembered more for the attitudes they brought to whatever they wrote about than for what they actually said.
以色列已经进入后现代时期，在前卫派高科技感性、世俗和越来越正统的宗教身份以及整体民族主义观念方面产生全新、有时甚至是惊人的协同作用。	Israel has become post-modern, producing new – and sometimes startling – synergies among its avant-garde high-tech sensibility, its secular and ever more orthodox religious identities, and its overall ethno-nationalist outlook.
而以色列在18年徒劳的军事占领后于2000年3月从黎巴嫩撤军，这在很大程度上反映了“四母亲运动”对以色列政府的巨大影响。	And Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000, after 18 years of useless military occupation, largely reflected the immense impact of the “Four Mothers’ Movement” on Israel’s government.
国际货币基金组织的特别融资便利规定，委内瑞拉最高有可能获得超过700亿美元的新增融资来支持其改革计划。	Under the IMF’s exceptional access facility, Venezuela would potentially be eligible for more than $70 billion of new finance to support its reform program.
这也有助于避免这样的情景：特朗普政府屈于政治压力威胁采取保护主义措施，增加爆发一损俱损的贸易战的风险。	And it would help to avoid a scenario in which a Trump administration, under political pressure, would threaten protectionist measures, increasing the risk of a trade war that would hurt nearly everyone.
事实上，中国受到来自金融危机的短暂而又猛烈的冲击证明了一点，那就是该国的经济增长仍然依赖来自美国，欧洲和日本的消费需求 — — 而且这种态势还将持续一段时间。	Indeed, the short, sharp shock that China absorbed from the financial crisis has proven that its economic growth still depends on consumer demand in America, Europe, and Japan – and will for some time to come.
虽然有些刻薄的批评家会问 ： “ 还有其他80%呢 ？ ” 但这至少说明有一批人在目睹了最近被大批揭露的经济欺诈和贪婪丑行之后，转而对道德有所诉求。	That will, of course, prompt cynics to ask: “What about the other 80%?” But those who have taken the oath are part of a larger turn toward ethics that has followed the recent flood of revelations of dishonesty and greed in the financial sector.
这表明中国政府逐渐朝市场汇率转变的政策也许比一般认为的执行得更好；即使是支持股市的措施，现在看起来也并不像7月时那样无用。	This suggests that the government’s policy of shifting gradually to a market-based exchange rate may have been better executed than generally believed; even the measures to support the stock market now look less futile than they did in July.
如果失去这些将热量反射会太空的冰盾，升温还将加速，导致冻土融化，封存的远古甲烷和二氧化碳将回到大气中。	Without this icy shield to reflect heat back into space, warming accelerates, permafrost melts, and ancient stores of methane and CO2 are returned to the atmosphere.
2011年，国会议员吉福斯（Gabrielle Giffords）遭遇枪击，这使得政客们甚至害怕自己也成为目标。	Given the shooting of then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, perhaps they even fear that they, too, might be targeted.
于是我们看到的是美联储和财政部（还有全球各国当局联手）只有很短的时间去手忙脚乱地安排如何防止一场系统性崩溃。	And only frenetic action by the Federal Reserve and Treasury (with authorities around the world joining) prevented a systemic meltdown.
这一情形很不妙，因为如果我们仅仅采用货币政策就可以防止萧条，那么我们就会这样做，因为这是我们了解最多的用于宏观经济稳定的政策工具，而且它带来的破坏性副作用风险也最小。	And this is too bad, for if we could prevent a depression with monetary policy alone, we would do so, as it is the policy tool for macroeconomic stabilization that we know best and that carries the least risk of disruptive side effects.
但在北欧国家看来（这种看法有相当的道理 ） ， 事后保险（如不良贷款）是一种再分配，把负担抛给了无辜的围观者（在这个例子中是北欧纳税人 ） 。	But in northern Europeans’ (quite reasonable) view, insurance after an accident has occurred (think of non-performing loans) is a form of redistribution that shifts the burden to innocent bystanders (in this case, northern taxpayers).
这其中当然不乏发展空间：亚洲发展中国家的工业出产份额2010年超过了经合组织的平均水平（41%比24 % ） ，但服务业份额却依然大幅落后（48%比75 % ） 。	There is certainly room to grow: the share of industry in developing Asia’s output surpassed the OECD average in 2010 (41% vs. 24%), but the share of services still lags by a wide margin (48% vs. 75%).
勿需多言，这位司机刚刚把票投给了马琳·勒庞 — — 尽管他看起来并不像是国民阵线口中所谓“血统纯正”的法国人。	Needless to say, the driver had voted for Marine Le Pen – although he did not look like what the National Front would call a “pureblooded” Frenchman.
但是，尽管中右翼联盟输掉了选举，但主要反对党瑞典社会民党（Swedish Social Democratic Party）及其左翼盟友也没有获胜。	But, though the Alliance certainly lost, the main opposition Swedish Social Democratic Party and its allies on the left did not win.
最后一个成就令我感到尤其自豪，因为，我和我的莫桑比克免疫推广工作同事一直在努力，我认为我们对这一成就做出了贡献。	I am particularly proud of the last achievement, because, by working in partnership with my fellow Mozambicans to expand immunization coverage, I believe that I have played a part in bringing it about.
沙特瓦哈比政权体制产生了9/11袭击中19名劫机犯中的15人。 美国并没有鼓励该政权的改革，普通穆斯林民众认为美国在向一个与9/11犯罪毫无牵连的政权发动战争。	Instead of encouraging reform of the Saudi/Wahhabi regime – the system that spawned 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 attacks – the average Muslim saw America as waging war on a regime that had nothing to do with that crime.
在普京掌权期间俄罗斯保持克制对美国及其盟国都非常重要 — — 在普京下台后奉行除普京主义以外其他策略的俄罗斯也是一样。	The US and its partners have a large stake in greater Russian restraint while Putin remains in power – and in a Russia characterized by other than Putinism after he is gone.
但现在，波特写到 ： “ 现在，我们一亿公民的心声通过一个中央政府来集中体现，这比我们各自为政而产生的效果要好的多。	But now, Porter wrote, after the depression and war, “We began to listen to the idea that a hundred million citizens, acting through a central government, could achieve much more than a hundred million acting as separate selfish units.
根据意大利央行的说法，如果要实现公共债务的可持续性，该国应该将其基本预算盈余（排除利息支出之外的收入和支出之间的差额）比率提高到GDP的3.5~4 ％ 。	To put the country on a path toward public-debt sustainability, the country should be increasing its primary surplus (the difference between revenues and expenditures net of interest payments), to 3.5-4% of GDP, according to the Bank of Italy.
经过六年的“幕后领导”和划定毫无意义的红线，美国总统奥巴马已经开始寻求创新、灵活的外交军事安排 — — 以便在应对全球威胁的斗争中发挥作用。	After six years of “leading from behind” and drawing meaningless red lines, US President Barack Obama has started to seek out innovative, flexible arrangements – diplomatic and military – to respond to global threats.
对于不同的观点意见，我们必须突出强调而不再是藏头露尾，应当视其他政党为提供多样化意见的智囊团和工作室，而非“战争总部 ” 。	We need to highlight, not hide , different views, and see our parties less as “war headquarters” and more as bio-diverse think tanks or workshops.
原因之一是我们不知道如何贮存这些资源生成的能源：如果不刮风也不出太阳，什么能给你的计算机或是医院的手术室提供动力？	One reason is that we don’t know how to store the energy from these sources: when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, what powers your computer or the hospital’s operating room?
但你永远不可能从（比如）德国财长朔伊布勒（Wolfgang Schäuble）吹嘘德国美德时听说这一点。	But one would never know that from listening, for example, to Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, extolling his country’s virtues.
在其权力征程中，毛泽东采取了生活在公元前500年左右的孙子的兵法。 而产生于差不多时期的儒家思想至今仍占据中国社会思想核心地位，尽管毛泽东对其进行了无情的镇压。	In his conquest of power, Mao Zedong used military tactics derived from Sun Tzu, who lived around 500 BC; Confucianism, dating from around the same time, remains at the heart of China’s social thinking, despite Mao’s ruthless attempts to suppress it.
但关键在于即将进行的巴基斯坦选举不要影响最新获得的进展，特别是在目前的低传播率季节（即阻止其传播的最佳机会的节骨眼上 ） 。	But it is critical that the country’s upcoming election does not jeopardize recent gains, particularly during the current low-transmission season, which is the best opportunity to stop the disease in its tracks.
紧接着宋思明 — — 一个相貌端正，仕途顺利，开着辆奥迪车的市长秘书 — — 出现了，他告诉郭海藻 ： “ 没人会注意那些藏污纳垢的角落 。 ”	As Song Siming, a handsome, successful, and Audi-driving – but also married – secretary to the Mayor, tells her, “On those unsightly corners in the dark where dirt, flies, and rats wander, nobody's paying attention.”
因此，总时薪正在快速增长，2015年一季度增长年率为3.1 % ， 而2014年全年为2.5 % ， 2013年为1.1 % 。	As a result, total compensation per hour is rising more rapidly, with the annual rate increasing to 3.1% in the first quarter of 2015, from 2.5% in 2014 as a whole and 1.1% in 2013.
大幅降低二氧化碳的排放是一个需要紧急解决的问题，而聚变在二十二世纪前不太可能生产出足够的能源才达到这个目标。	A drastic reduction of CO2 emissions is an urgent priority, but fusion is unlikely to produce sufficient energy to achieve that goal before the twenty-second century.
叙利亚反对派是由众多大相径庭的集团和势力组成的乌合之众，基地组织也在其中。 穆尔西下台后，他们极有可能变得更加极端。	The Syrian opposition, a crucible of widely different groups and currents – including Al Qaeda – will most likely become even more radical following Morsi’s ouster.
因欧洲主权债务危机导致的流动性短缺使得发达国家银行 — — 特别是对香港存在风险敞口的欧洲银行 — — 以美元的形式抽回了资金。	The liquidity shortage caused by the European sovereign debt-crisis led developed countries’ banks – especially European banks with exposure in Hong Kong – to withdraw their funds, taking dollars with them.
在这两个例子中，非洲最老牌的两个解放运动政党，在引起了群众的极度不满之后，被迫抛弃了各自的领导人。 它们上台执政都可以追溯到二十五年前。	In both cases, two of the oldest liberation parties in Africa, which have remained in office since first coming to power a quarter-century ago, were forced by deep popular discontent to push their leaders aside.
在短期内最容易受到自动化影响的活动是那些常规的认知任务，比如数据收集和处理，以及在结构化，可预测环境中的常规手工和体力活动。	The activities most susceptible to automation in the near term are routine cognitive tasks like data collection and data processing, as well as routine manual and physical activities in structured, predictable environments.
据估计，在未来数年，亚洲中产阶级人数将迎来爆发性增长，从2010年的5亿增加到2020年的17.5亿。	Asia’s middle-class population is expected to experience explosive growth in the coming years, rising from 500 million people in 2010 to 1.75 billion in 2020.
将中国硬着陆定义为当前6.7%的增长率下降一半，则其直接和间接总影响将是全球总增长下降一个百分点左右。	Defining a Chinese hard landing as a halving of the current 6.7% growth rate, the combined direct and indirect effects of such an outcome would consequently knock about one percentage point off overall global growth.
尽管没有人确切知道政府如何估计价格，但是鉴于商店里空空如也，大多数指标表明津巴布韦确实很有可能打破通货膨胀的世界纪录。	While no one is quite certain how the government managed to estimate prices, given that there is virtually nothing for sale in the shops, most indicators suggest that Zimbabwe does have a good shot at breaking world records for inflation.
虽然有许多退休人员和一些工人对卢卡申科的统治表示满意，但许多年轻人和受过教育的人都在去年12月的大选中投了反对票 — — 大量证据显示总统只获得了全部票数中的不到50%	While many pensioners and some workers remain content with life under Lukashenko, young people, and those with the most education and talent, voted against him in December – and much evidence suggests that he won less than 50%.
最令人担忧的是，墨西哥人可以在2018年选择民族主义者安德里斯·曼努埃尔·洛佩兹·奥布拉多尔（Andrés Manuel López Obrador）当总统，以此来回应美国的挑衅。	Most worrying, the Mexican people could respond to US provocation by electing their own nationalist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, in 2018.
为显示修建平方公里天线阵的诚意，南非政府于2006年投资2.5亿美元在境内建造无线天线阵，该天线阵可作为平方公里天线阵的前身。	To lend credibility to its bid to host the SKA, in 2006 South Africa’s government committed $250 million to build an array of radio dishes within its own borders as a precursor to the SKA.
由于沙特阿拉伯的资金支持，新建的瓦哈比宗教学校在也门遍地开花，所以也门伊斯兰圣战分子的人数会急剧增长，就没什么好奇怪的了。	With new Wahhabi madrasas popping up everywhere in Yemen because of Saudi financial support, it is small wonder that the number of Yemeni jihadis has grown exponentially.
���国表现最佳的前17个城市的生产率大约是香港的三分之一（香港的人均GDP是其的三倍 ） ， 因此这些城市的房价达到香港的三分之一左右不足为奇。	Given that China’s 17 top-performing cities are roughly one-third as productive as Hong Kong, where per capita GDP is three times higher, it is not surprising that their property prices amount to about one-third of Hong Kong’s.
中国还愤怒地回应了美国海军舰艇上月通过南海争议水域，中国外交部称此举为严重损害中国主权和安全的“挑衅行为 ” 。	The Chinese also responded furiously to the passage of a US naval warship through disputed waters in the South China Sea last month, a move that the foreign ministry called a “provocation” that “severely undermines China’s sovereignty and security.”
现代史以来最严重的消费衰退 — — 2008—2009年耐久品支出下降创出历史记录 — — 应该触发被抑制需求的全面爆发。	The worst consumer recession in modern history, featuring a record collapse in durable-goods expenditures in 2008-2009, should have triggered an outsize surge of pent-up demand.
芝加哥 — — 如果未来几天内出台的欧洲危机解决方案想要重塑人们对主权债券的信心的话，那么该计划就必须在经济上可行，而且在政治上可以让救援者和被救援者双方接受。	CHICAGO – If any solution to the European crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereign-bond markets, it will have to be both economically viable and politically palatable to rescuers and rescued alike.
民粹主义运动兴起，要求关闭边境、建造新隔离墙，而他们拒绝接受专家意见让赫尔丁看到了一个“残酷的真相 ” ： “我们不再能够理所当人地认为人们相信科学、事实和知识 。 ”	Populist movements have emerged, calling for closed borders and new walls, and their rejection of expertise has led Heldin to a “grim truth”: that “we can no longer take it for granted that people believe in science, facts, and knowledge.”
美国在对气候变化无动于衷的问题上需要承担极大比例的责任，因为它长期以来一直是世界最大的温室气体排放者，而且直到去年才被中国超过。	The US bears disproportionate responsibility for inaction on climate change, because it was long the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, until last year, when China overtook it.
但和美国和欧洲一样，日本仍然像堂吉诃德那样执着地向通缩的风车发动进攻，将利率设置在极低水平，买入大规模政府债务。	Yet Japan, like the US and Europe, continues to display a quixotic tendency to tilt at deflation windmills, with rock-bottom interest rates and purchases of massive amounts of government debt.
越来越多的证据表明很大一部分用于研究的哺乳动物，尤其是啮齿类动物，因为它们的生活条件而受到心理压力。	Evidence is gradually accumulating that the majority of mammalian research animals, particularly rodents, are mentally stressed by their living conditions.
埃及总统阿卜杜勒 - 法塔赫·塞西不但满足不了这些迫切的需求，反而被迫将领土交还给沙特以换取国家支撑下去所需要的援助。	Instead of delivering on these imperatives, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has been forced to relinquish territory to the Saudis to secure the aid the country needs to stay afloat, facing considerable mockery in the process.
如果那个孩子遗传了这种基因，那么他/她就会在40岁左右发病，导致动作不受控制，性格突变以及缓慢的认知能力衰退。	If the child does inherit it, he or she will, at around 40, begin to suffer uncontrollable movements, personality changes, and a slow deterioration of cognitive capacities.
如果你判断第一种情况是1，也就是可以；第二种情况是2，也就是有义务；第三种情况是3，也就是禁止，那么，你就和全球1500名在我们的道德感网络测试（http : / /moral.wjh.harvard.edu / ） 回答了这些难题的人一样。	If you judged case 1 as permissible, case 2 as obligatory, and case 3 as forbidden, then you are like the 1,500 subjects around the world who responded to these dilemmas on our web-based moral sense test (http://moral.wjh.harvard.edu/).
中期选举后，哈格尔 — — 奥巴马六年任期中的第三任国防部长 — — 成了风雨飘摇的奥巴马政府的替罪羊。	After the midterm elections, Hagel – Obama’s third defense secretary in six years – became the floundering administration’s sacrificial lamb.
但边境调节税的另外一个问题是它将给全球供应链造成大面积破坏，而全球供应链是过去几十年来美国公司部门赖以生存的基础。	Yet another problem with the BAT is that it would create massive disruptions in the global supply chains that the US corporate sector has built over the last few decades.
因此，欧盟应该快速行动起来，实施面向“能源穷人”的定向社会支持计划，并辅之以能源效率投资方面的金融支持。	The EU should thus quickly implement a targeted program of social support for the “energy poor,” coupled with financial support for investment in energy efficiency.
当然，后者需要以前者为基础；但同时也意味着要超越统计数据的羁绊，从有希望、有恐惧和有抱负的鲜活的人的角度来理解民众的需求。	Of course, the latter requires delivering the former; but it also means going beyond statistics, to comprehend that we are all individuals with our own hopes, fears, and aspirations.
大部分讨论集中在美联储是否应该将年物价增长减缓至2%甚至更低，以巩固过去15年中决策者苦苦缠斗通胀所取得的战果。	Most of the discussion focused on whether the Fed should slow annual price growth to 2% or even lower, thereby consolidating the gains made in the difficult fight against inflation that policymakers had waged for the previous 15 years.
根据2009年和2012年国际学生评估计划（Program for International Student Assessment）的数据，上海十五岁年龄组学生在数学、科学和阅读能力方面表现在65个国家（其中包括34个经合组织国家）中名列前茅。	Fifteen-year-olds in Shanghai outperformed students from 65 countries, including 34 OECD countries, in mathematics, science, and reading, according to the Program for International Student Assessment in 2009 and 2012.
叶利钦感受到了莫斯科那些有望成为中产阶级的人的痛苦绝望，并迅速奠定了苏共老卫士强烈批判者的声誉，虽然立场并不总是那么一致。	Sensing the bitter frustration of Moscow’s middle class-in-waiting, Yeltsin quickly gained a reputation as a harsh, if not always coherent, critic of the party’s old guard.
如果巴勒斯坦领袖看看地中海对面的塞浦路斯，就能看见难民们如何在不放弃领土要求的情况下有尊严、有名誉地生活。	These leaders would do better to look across the Mediterranean at Cyprus and see how - without giving up claims to disputed land - refugees can live in dignity and honor.
绿色债券开始发行，2014年发行量超过400亿美元，而随着更明确的标准和监管的实施，绿色债券有望变得更加流行。	Green bonds have taken off, with upwards of $40 billion issued in 2014, and they are likely to become only more popular as clearer standards and regulations are established.
但是如果这就是“流动性泛滥”的意思的话，那么它今天的广泛应用只不过是反映了我们已经拥有的很高的资产价格。	But if that is what the term “awash with liquidity” means, then its widespread use today is simply a reflection of the high asset prices that we already have.
但是，普京为了达到他的目标而采取模仿和使用象征性的符号 — — 这些陈旧的观念再也无法对俄罗斯目前的能力现状作出反应。	But the old ideas, the mimicry and symbols Putin employs to achieve his goals, no longer correspond to today’s realities or Russia’s present capabilities.
此外，通过分析产品的在线评论，制造商可以识别哪些功能是消费者最愿意掏钱购买的，并据此开发商业和投资战略。	And, by analyzing online comments about their products, manufacturers can identify which features consumers are most willing to pay for, and develop their business and investment strategies accordingly.
世界各地的妇女 — — 无论年龄、种族、民族、性取向和宗教信仰 — — 都必须能够获得安全的堕胎服务。	And women everywhere – regardless of age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation – must have access to safe abortion services.
当经济进步的收益主要流向已经十分富裕的群体时，少数和多数文化价值观的脱节就变得严重起来，形成动摇的效果。	It is when the rewards of economic progress accrue mainly to the already wealthy that the disjunction between minority and majority cultural values becomes seriously destabilizing.
在洪灾顶峰，印度政府从国家灾难响应基金（National Disaster Response Fund）中拨款进行紧急救援。	At the peak of the floods, the Indian government allocated money from the National Disaster Response Fund for immediate relief.
克劳狄乌斯通过组建庞大的法律团队和大肆贿赂逃脱了惩罚，接着，他进入政界，试图保证很快就将他鄙视为小丑的执政阶级的尊重。	After escaping punishment by employing a large legal team and doling out generous bribes, Clodius entered politics in an effort to secure the respect of the ruling class, which was quick to dismiss him as a buffoon.
佛山毗邻香港，并借助这一优势稳固地嵌入全球供应链中 — — 驱动其名义GDP的快速增长，从1978年的约13亿人民币增加到去年的6709亿人民币。	Given Foshan’s proximity to Hong Kong, it is firmly embedded in global supply chains – a fact that has helped to drive rapid nominal GDP growth, from roughly ¥1.3 billion in 1978 to ¥670.9 billion ($109.7 billion) last year.
而特朗普政府则恰恰相反，彻底中断了对温和派反对团体的军事援助，因为他们的结论显然是根本不存在温和派反对组织。	The Trump administration, by contrast, has shut down military assistance to moderate opposition groups altogether, having apparently concluded that no such forces exist.
上一个自由主义周期，与弗兰克林· 罗斯福总统的新政以及经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯联系在一起，是由大萧条引发的，虽然它花费了第二次世界大战巨额的政府开支才使其正常运行。	The last liberal cycle, associated with President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and the economist John Maynard Keynes, was triggered by the Great Depression, though it took World War II’s massive government spending to get it properly going.
换句话说，那些东亚领导人的熟人和捐助者都是“权贵 ” ， 那么难道美国领导人身边的都是“朋友 ” ？	In other words, the acquaintances and benefactors of the East Asian leaders were “cronies,” whereas those of US leaders were “friends”?
但《利维坦》对现代俄罗斯生活的凄惨描述实际上确认了美国人不相信俄罗斯可以改良随后的共产主义崩溃的许多理由。	But Leviathan's bleak portrait of contemporary Russian life actually confirms many of the reasons why Americans have been largely dubious about Russia's ability to reform following communism's collapse.
"纳入宪法中的""基本权利目录""内容广泛，以尊重人的尊严、自由、平等为中心，同时还阐明了民主原则以及法律规则。"	"The ""catalogue of fundamental rights"" included in the Constitution is extensive, centering on respect for human dignity, freedom, and equality, and also on the principles of democracy and the rule of law."
如果付诸行动，而且她果真认真地改革德国福利国家的激励结构，结果将有可能会是更高的就业率和结构性经济增长。	If this is more than lip service, and if she really carries out a serious reform of the German welfare state’s incentive structure, the result could be higher employment and structural economic growth.
但也有一个更为个人的方面：渴望被别人认识和希望保护自身秘密（无论是阴险的，尴尬的或私密的）之间的纠结关系	But there is also a more personal aspect: the tension between the desire to be known and the desire to protect one’s secrets, whether insidious, embarrassing, or intimate.
首先，美国对几乎所有国家都存在贸易赤字，包括加拿大、墨西哥、中国、德国、法国、如本、韩国和中国台湾，更不用说石油出口国了，其中最大的赤字来自中国哦。	One is that, while the United States runs a trade deficit with almost everyone, including Canada, Mexico, China, Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, not to mention the oil-exporting countries, the largest deficit is with China.
但不幸地是，尽管日本历史学家提供了极为详尽的（甚至是档案）证据，日本政府依然拒绝承认日本战时政权对这个恐怖计划应负的责任。	Unfortunately, the Japanese government, despite much circumstantial and even documentary evidence supplied by Japanese historians, now chooses to deny the wartime regime’s responsibility for this ghastly project.
在科特迪瓦首都阿比让，非洲开发银行投资的价值2，300万美元的古鲁盆地综合流域管理项目大大减少了古鲁盆地的洪灾次数，并显著改善了280万居民的生活。	In Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, the $23 million AfDB-funded Gourou Basin Integrated Watershed Management Project significantly reduced flooding throughout the Gourou Basin, and improved 2.8 million inhabitants’ livelihoods.
这或许有她的道理，但孩子们难道就不能被鼓励去做一些本身就有价值的事情，而只能在被父母批评的恐惧中被迫行事？	Perhaps, but can’t children be encouraged to do things because they are intrinsically worthwhile, rather than because of fear of parental disapproval?
线粒体是为细胞提供能量的“电池 ” ， 含有细胞核外全部的遗传物质 — — 线粒体共包含37种基因，约占人类基因构成的0.2 % 。	The mitochondria are the energy-producing “batteries” of the cell, containing the only DNA outside of the cell nucleus – 37 genes, or roughly 0.2% of a person’s genetic makeup.
如果违约的解释主张偿付应该与经济复苏挂钩，那么具体说明恢复偿还的条件 — — 并在条件满足时兑现承诺 — — 是大有裨益的。	If the explanation for a default includes an assertion that payments should be tied to economic recovery, then it can make sense to specify the conditions for resuming payments – and follow through when the conditions are met.
这不啻给当前的赤字削减计划伤口撒盐，但只要政府在继续削减支出，这倒是有利于（从保守派的角度看）在长期削弱政府的作用。	This knocks a hole in current deficit-reduction plans, but, provided government continues to cut spending, it has the benefit (from a conservative’s point of view) of shrinking the state’s role over time.
纽约—在《大教堂谋杀案 》 （ Murder in the Cathedral）一剧中，艾略特（T. S. Eliot）描写了坎特伯雷大主教托马斯·贝克特（Thomas Becket）被沉默命令谋杀的案子。	NEW YORK – In his play Murder in the Cathedral, T. S. Eliot describes the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, as a silently ordered hit.
当我们的评估团队在Marare时，目睹了两位二十多岁的男孩共进早餐的寻常事变成一幕夸张的惨剧：其中一人不慎擦枪走火，误杀了另一个。	While our assessment team was in the town of Marare, a banal scene of two friends in their twenties having breakfast turned into a major drama when one of the boys mishandled his Kalashnikov and accidentally killed his friend.
自欧元开始流通之后，各国商业银行都可以在欧洲中央银行的贴现窗口将自己持有的政府债券换成现金，而监管者则政府债券视作零风险证券。	After the euro came into force, commercial banks could refinance their holdings of government bonds at the discount window of the European Central Bank, and regulators treated government bonds as riskless.
光是这一点就已经是一个进步，因为在美国（也许还有中国和印度）这样的大国，如今抗生素的使用更多是为了促进农业增长，而不是治疗人类传染病。	That alone is a big step forward, given that, in big countries such as the United States, and possibly China and India, antibiotics are now used more for growth promotion in agriculture than for fighting infections in humans.
欧洲央行行长简·克劳德·特里谢（Jean-Claude Trichet）也不会屈服于法国的压力，实行更为柔和的货币政策。	Nor will ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet be intimidated by French pressure to pursue a softer monetary policy.
2014年召开的上一次会议标志着邓小平“韬光养晦，争取时间，永不称霸”指导方针的终结，并预示着一个中国开展国际行动的新时代。	The last such conference, in 2014, marked the funeral of Deng Xiaoping’s dictum of “hide your strength, bide your time, never take the lead,” and heralded a new era of international activism.
因为欧盟在工业和渔业产品方面的共同关税处于相对较低的水平，这可能不会对英国出口产品造成难以逾越的障碍，也可以在保护英国公司免受进口冲击方面有一定的灵活性。	Because the common tariff is at a relatively low level on industrial and fishery products, this might not be an insuperable barrier for UK exports, and it would allow some flexibility in protecting UK companies from imports.
安倍晋三和习近平最近表现出灵活姿态，这或许反映了两国国内政局的变化，保守派、民族主义阵营和更加国际导向的商业利益之间形成了更平等的平衡。	One reason for Abe and Xi’s newfound flexibility may be domestic political shifts in both countries, which have created a more equal balance between conservative, nationalist groups and more internationally-oriented business interests.
在20世纪90年代末，贸易平衡强化不会带来产出增长或就业创造 — — 它们已经达到了马力全开的成都。	A stronger trade balance in the late 1990s would not have added to output growth or job creation, which were running at full throttle.
此外，东巴基斯坦人对政治权力掌握在西巴基斯坦政客和将军手中非常不满，因为这些人明目张胆地无视孟加拉人的要求。	There was, moreover, strong resentment that political power lay in the hands of western-based politicians and generals who were blatantly insensitive to Bengali demands.
如果经济不能恢复增长，它们的财政问题就会进一步暴露，要推行改革以恢复外贸竞争力的政治难度也会进一步加大。	If growth does not recover, the fiscal problems will worsen while making it more politically difficult to enact the painful reforms needed to restore competitiveness.
首先，在现代社会里，刑罚的目的不仅是为了渊渊相报，也是为了让犯人改过自新，使他们能够在社会中与他人和谐相处。	First, in a modern democracy, punishment must be not only retributive, but should also try to rehabilitate the criminal in order to enable him to live in society with other human beings.
发自柏林 — — 两年多以来欧洲已经接连召开了多个峰会，而且每一场在闭幕时都向外界保证遏制欧元区主权债务危机的必要手段“终于”得以推行。	BERLIN – For two years now, one European summit after another has ended with assurances that – at long last – the necessary measures for containing the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis have been taken.
跟2009年不同的是，爱尔兰政府对欧盟当局最近对苹果的裁决提出了抗议，指出税收政策是各国政府而非欧盟的管理范围。	Unlike in 2009, the Irish government is protesting the EU authorities’ recent Apple ruling, pointing out that tax policy is in the purview of national governments, not the Union.
里斯本—自由意味着自我所有权（self-ownership）神圣不可侵犯，这曾经是自由主义的一条公理。	LISBON – It used to be an axiom of liberalism that freedom meant inalienable self-ownership.
但在上述转变实现之前，我们请求个人慈善家、企业和慈善机构 — — 以及新老捐助者 — — 齐心协力推动这次创业。	But, until this shift occurs, we will ask individual philanthropists, corporations and charities – as well as new and old aid donors – to come together to catalyze the venture.
几年前当上海举起中华牌的时候，全世界的银行家和投资客都在猜测，其用意是否真的就是要让上海取代香港成为中国的金融中心。	When Shanghai sought a similar role several years ago, bankers and investors around the world wondered whether the aim was really for Shanghai to replace Hong Kong as China’s financial heart.
冷战已经结束，苏联解体，阿拉伯世界受到削弱，与阿拉伯国家发生常规战争已经不再可能。 以色列占领这一领土的战略考虑已经过时了。	With the Cold War over, the USSR gone, and the Arab world weakened, a conventional war with the armies of Arab states is no longer likely, rendering obsolete the strategic considerations underlying Israel’s occupation of this territory.
这种面临阴影的体系包括结构性投资工具（SIVs ） 、 管道（以资产支持商业票据为自己筹资 ） 、 货币市场基金、对冲基金和投资银行。	This shadow system includes structured investment vehicles (SIVs), conduits, money market funds, hedge funds, and investment banks.
如果伦齐失败 — — 目前这种可能性越来越大 — — 反欧元的五星运动（Five Star Movement，在最近的市政选举中表现出色）可能早在明年上台掌权。	If Renzi fails – as is increasingly possible – the anti-euro Five Star Movement (which recently did well in municipal elections) could come to power as early as next year.
对于一名EMBI+投资者而言这是个好消息，因为这意味着更多的钱被留下来为你的债券服务，与此同时委内瑞拉人民都在被迫减肥并在垃圾堆里翻找食物。	That’s good news for you as an EMBI+ investor, because it means that more money is left to service your bonds. Meanwhile, Venezuelans are involuntarily losing weight and searching for food in garbage piles.
事实上，这一周结束时，特朗普还必须找到人选取代他的幕僚长约翰·凯利（John Kelly ） 。 特朗普宣布，凯利将在今年年底离开白宫（两人只是泛泛之交 ） 。	Indeed, capping off the week, Trump was confronted with the need to find a replacement for his chief of staff, John Kelly, who the president announced would be leaving at the end of the year (the two are barely on speaking terms).
他重视公共服务，并认为自己只不过是众多美国总统中的最新一员，是白宫椭圆形办公室的某个临时占用者，也是美国民主的监护人。	He valued public service and saw himself as simply the latest in the long line of US presidents, another temporary occupant of the Oval Office and custodian of American democracy.
） 。 在他1973年发表的讨论班论文《婚姻论 》 （ A Theory of Marriage）中，贝克尔指出，挑选伴侣本身是一类市场，婚姻仅当伴侣双方都获益时才发生。	In his seminal paper, “A Theory of Marriage,” published in 1973, Becker argued that selecting a partner is its own kind of market, and marriages occur only when both partners gain.
在固定汇率制度下出售主权债券会形成收益率上升的直接压力，外国人出售私人证券也具有类似的效应，但渠道不同。	The sale of sovereign bonds under the fixed exchange-rate regime put direct upward pressure on their yields, while sales of private securities by foreigners had a similar effect, but through indirect channels.
一所原本属于国营的企业继续维持运作的原因则是 2001 年签订租赁协议时规定十年之内不能让任何员工下岗。	One formerly state-run enterprise was being operated under a 2001 lease specifying that no workers could be laid off for the next ten years.
开罗—埃及有史以来首位民选总统穆罕默德·穆尔西最近授权自己暂时掌握一切大权，他声称这样是为了实现推翻穆巴拉克独裁的革命的目标。	CAIRO – Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s first-ever elected civilian president, recently granted himself sweeping temporary powers in order, he claims, to attain the objectives of the revolution that overthrew Hosni Mubarak’s dictatorship.
首先，随着较谨慎地监管的银行出于主动或其他原因停止了某些行为，它们现在已经被非银行机构取代，而这些非银行机构不受同样的监督和监管标准约束。	First, as more carefully regulated banks have ceased certain activities, voluntarily or otherwise, they have been replaced by non-banks that are not subject to the same supervisory and regulatory standards.
相反，美国食品和药品监督局（Food and Drug Administration）雇用了4,000名评审员，欧洲药品局（European Medicines Agency）有3,000人。	By contrast, the United States Food and Drug Administration employs 4,000 reviewers, and the European Medicines Agency has 3,000.
除此之外，中国政府还面临维护金融和社会稳定的挑战，与此同时需要管理好世界最庞大的官僚机构。 任务之艰巨令人难以置信。	Add to it the challenge of upholding financial and social stability – and accomplishing all of this while managing one of the world’s largest bureaucracies – and the task ahead becomes truly mind-boggling.
由于中国存在为数巨大的地方政府和公司债务，但同时也存在为数巨大的国内储蓄和坚挺的财政状况，情况就变得非常重要。	Given that China is saddled with large local-government and corporate debts, but also enjoys large domestic savings and a strong fiscal position, this message could not be more pertinent.
举个例子，在2004年度的研究总结中，他们写道 ， “ 根据保守估计我们认为从2003年入侵伊拉克后死亡人数至少增长了100,000人或者更多 。 ”	For example, in a summary of the 2004 study, they wrote, “Making conservative assumptions we think that about 100,000 excess deaths, or more, have happened since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.”
相反，对保密的批判应该类似于真相和妥协过程（truth and reconciliation process ） ， 由做出错误行为者充分承担公共责任，并可伴随受害者的证词。	Instead, the repudiation of secrecy should resemble a truth and reconciliation process, with wrongdoers providing a full public account of their behavior, perhaps accompanied by testimony from victims.
意大利财政部长帕多安（Pier Carlo Padoan）正确地指出应该采取欧元区“记分牌 ” ， 直接比较各国的改革。	Italy’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, is rightly pushing for a eurozone “reform scorecard,” which would enable direct comparison among national reforms.
但是，即使在美国，失经过一整年的下降后，失业率仍有7 % ， 长期失业占总失业的比重则高达反常的36 % ， 这意味着技能基础可能会受到影响，复苏将更加艰难。	But, even there, while the unemployment rate has dropped during the year, and now stands at 7%, long-term joblessness is at an unusually high 36% of total unemployment, threatening to erode the skills base and make recovery that much more difficult.
可惜，对于这需要什么，人们还没有形成共识，而即使在存在一些一致意见的地方，也缺乏做出必要的军事和经济资源承诺的意愿。	Alas, there is no consensus on what this would require, and even where some agreement exists, sufficient will to commit the required military and economic resources does not.
那么当年“无限干涉”政策的主要反对者 — — 欧洲央行第一任首席经济学家奥托马·伊辛 — — 最近又开始指责“欧洲金融稳定基金广泛干涉”和欧元债券就并非巧合。	It is no coincidence that one of the leading opponents – the ECB’s first chief economist, Otmar Issing – of the “unlimited interventions” policy under the ERM recently rebuked both the “extended-EFSF” and Eurobonds.
军方不久前的攻击行动也证实了这一点，他们更多的依赖威胁平民安全的空袭，而不是能够精确实现军事目标的地面进攻。	The military’s recent offensive reflects this, relying on air strikes that imperiled civilians rather than a ground offensive that would have been more precise in achieving its objectives.
从20世纪80年代中到2005年，加州人口仅增长1000万，而医疗补助受益人却猛增了700万之多；所得税纳税人仅增长150,000，而监狱人口却增长了115,000之多。	From the mid-1980’s to 2005, California's population grew by 10 million, while Medicaid recipients soared by seven million; tax filers paying income taxes rose by just 150,000; and the prison population swelled by 115,000.
脚踏5英寸高跟鞋、衣着暴露的美女们的目光在各式富豪身上游移 — — 也可能是富豪们有意把她们带来为自己的游艇和首映礼增色的。	Young women in five-inch heels and revealing clothing prowled for wealthy men – or were imported by them to decorate boats and premiere parties.
让他们与AKP决裂的是重组“补习班”的政策争论。 “补习班”是一种昂贵的私人机构，为高中高年级学生提供大学入学考试备战指导。	What drove them to reject the party completely was a policy debate on restructuring “cram schools” – expensive private institutions that prepare high-school seniors for their university entrance examinations.
但是，正如欧洲政策研究中心（Center for European Policy Studies）的丹尼尔·格罗斯（Daniel Gros）所指出的，这个问题并不只是德国的问题。	However, as the Center for European Policy Studies’ Daniel Gros has pointed out, the issue is not simply Germany.
尽管印度的总统职位是礼仪性的，重要性不如总理(总理这一职务曾经由英吉拉·甘地担任 ) ， 但是这具有象征性意义。	Although India’s presidency is primarily a ceremonial post that carries less weight than that of prime minister (the position once held by Indira Gandhi), it is symbolically significant.
德国占全球出口的份额从2007年的9.1%下降到2013年的8 % — —这个数字跟两德刚刚统一的“病人时期”相同。	Its share of global exports fell from 9.1% in 2007 to 8% in 2013 – as low as in the “sick man” era, when Germany was struggling with reunification.
比如，如果某生产一般消费品的公司 — — 如食品公司，甚至汽车公司也是如此 — — 对俄销售较以前有所下降，你并不一定要把这一下降记为损失。	For example, if a company that produces a generic consumer good like food, or even cars, sells less in Russia than it did before, one should not necessarily count the reduction as a loss.
美国政客和决策者的思维一定不正常，否则他们绝不会认为900比1的军事-全球教育支出比有利于美国国家安全。	What US politicians and policymakers in their right minds could believe that US national security is properly pursued through a 900-to-1 ratio of military spending to global education spending?
位于最最急切需要解决的问题之首的是全球变暖，其他还包括恐怖主义、杀虫剂还有生物多样性的丢失，并且看上去急需解决的问题还有很多很多。	The list of urgent concerns is topped by global warming, but also includes terrorism, pesticides, and the loss of biodiversity – and seems to have virtually no end.
美国总统布什启动了一个帮助15个非洲国家控制疟疾的新计划，并史无前例地在12月主持了一场白宫峰会以争取私营部门的支持。	US President George W. Bush has launched an important new initiative to help 15 African countries to control malaria, and hosted an unprecedented White House summit in December to rally private-sector support.
它将是日渐老去的一代试图将他们的老旧本位主义凌驾于日益信奉世界大同的年轻一代之上的最后一搏，但这一尝试只在一个不幸的国家取得了一次成功。	It will be the last gasp of an aging generation that tried to impose its nostalgic parochialism on an increasingly cosmopolitan younger generation, but succeeded in only one unfortunate country.
巴西在去年就应该被降级到投资级以下，因为巴西经济存在不断扩大的财政赤字、日益增加的总体经济债务负担，以及疲软且不断恶化的商业环境。	Brazil should have been downgraded below investment grade last year, as the economy struggled with a widening fiscal deficit, a growing economy-wide debt burden, and a weak and worsening business environment.
愿意采取新措施的美国、更有信心的日本和印度，以及对中国干涉内政忍无可忍的澳大利亚必须联合起来约束中国。	A US that is willing to employ new tools, a more confident Japan and India, and an Australia vexed by China’s meddling in its domestic affairs must work together to constrain Chinese behavior.
不断深入的亚洲各经济体贸易金融一体化让它们越来越容易受到中国的增长冲击，其中大宗商品出口商和资本货物尤其脆弱。	Asian economies’ deepening trade and financial integration has left them increasingly vulnerable to growth shocks from China, with exporters of commodities and capital goods especially vulnerable.
比如德国博主理查德·古特亚尔（Richard Gutjahr）就因为在两周内连续出现在两场恐怖袭击现场而成为了阴谋论的目标并遭遇了大量网络骚扰。	The German blogger Richard Gutjahr, for example, became the object of conspiracy theories and the target of intense harassment after being present at two terrorist attacks within two weeks of each other.
这将有助于避免捕捉磷销的船只与依靠磷销为升的生物之间的竞争，因为磷虾的捕捉区域与企鹅和海豹觅食的重要区域严重重叠。	This would help avoid local competition between krill vessels and the creatures that need krill to live, since krill fishing closely overlaps with the critical foraging areas for penguins and seals.
现在让我们快进到当前：在农业，采矿业，制造业，能源，旅游业和商业服务业分别实现两位数出口增长的带领之下，阿尔巴尼亚经济正以4.2％的强劲势头增长。	Fast-forward to the present: the economy is growing at a robust 4.2% rate, led by double-digit export growth in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, energy, tourism, and business services.
没有出现“伊斯兰极端主义”或“伊斯兰国”的另一个原因是上述说法等于承认恐怖分子的宣传，即他们的所作所为符合伊斯兰教教义。	"Another reason that has been offered for not referring to “Islamic radicalism"" or the “Islamic State"" is that to do so concedes the terrorists' claims that they are acting in accordance with Islam's teachings."
一个反身性的经典例子是，今年7月中国股市繁荣转变为萧条时，政府的反应时投入2,000美元托市，并立刻继之以此前一直稳定的人民币小幅贬值。	In a classic example of reflexivity, when China’s stock-market boom turned into July’s bust, the government responded with a $200 billion attempt to support prices, closely followed by a small devaluation of the previously stable renminbi.
二十国集团在处理全球问题上可谓令人失望，而将主要新兴经济体纳入领先工业化国家论坛的思想也没有产生出可以测量的成就。	The G-20 has been a somewhat disappointing mechanism for tackling global issues, and the idea of bringing emerging economic giants into the same forum as the leading industrialized ones has yet to pay off in terms of measurable achievements.
和在科学领域一样，如果我们在政治领域忽略“被揭示的现实 ” ， 会导致发生灾难性后果的可能性大大增加。	In politics as in science, when we dismiss revealed truth, we increase the likelihood of catastrophically bad outcomes.
梅政府知道，如果脱欧运动的欺骗性被公诸于世，她现在与脱欧绑在一起的保守党将很有可能面临潜在的灾难性抵制。	May’s government knew that, if the Leave campaign’s deception had been revealed, her Conservative Party, now tethered to Brexit, would have faced a potentially disastrous backlash.
最近，中国开始以同样的改革实践模式来构建更加创新、更加强调知识基础的经济，即由服务业和国内消费驱动的增长。	More recently, China began to apply the same approach to building a more innovative, knowledge-based economy – one in which the services sectors, together with domestic consumption, drive growth.
尽管欧元区上下利率位于历史低点，但如果债券市场重新评估主权借款人的风险，欧元区政府债务可能面临严重压力。	Though interest rates across the European Union are at historic lows, government debt in the eurozone could come under severe pressure should bond markets re-evaluate the riskiness of sovereign borrowers.
有些城市特别适合这类活动，因为它们汇聚了多种多样的人力资本并鼓励这些拥有不同知识技能的人随意进行互动。	Certain cities are ideally suited for this, because they concentrate different kinds of human capital and encourage random interactions between people with different knowledge and skills.
当然，先锋成员国先行一步没有什么不对 — — 最近在伊拉克核计划问题上的外交倡议就刚好说明了这一点。	Of course, there’s nothing wrong with vanguard groups of members forging ahead – the recent diplomatic initiative concerning Iran’s nuclear program is a case in point.
“烟草管制政策 ” ， 普罗科特说 ， “ 太注重于公众教育，而实际上应该专注于取消烟草制品 。 ”	“Tobacco control policy,” Proctor says, “too often centers on educating the public, when it should be focused on fixing or eliminating the product.”
在关于国际足联丑闻被曝光后的两年以来该组织实施了持续的变革。 这个看似雷打不动的体系也在社会活动家、 赞助商和足球协会的压力下土崩瓦解，也表明变革不是不可能发生的。	In the two years since the truth about FIFA came to light, the rumblings of change can be heard, as what seemed to be an impenetrable system begins to crumble under the pressure of activists, sponsors, and soccer associations.
香港—最近，我遇到了两位身材苗条的男士，他们开发了一个减肥应用，这个应用提供每日菜单和食谱，如果用户不喜欢某种食物，它还能提供替代品。	HONG KONG – Recently I met with two nice slim men who have just launched a weight-loss app that provides daily menus and recipes, and offers some substitutions in case the user does not like a particular food.
哥伦比亚有权有势的保守建制派一直对和平特别管辖权所代表的精神倍感不满，因为上述条款把真相和受害者利益放在首位，因此格外注重修复而非惩戒。	Colombia’s powerful conservative establishment has never been happy with the liberal spirit underlying the JEP, which aims to be more restorative than punitive, putting the victims – and the truth – front and center.
以2014年西非埃博拉疫情为例：尽管在应对疟疾方面，支持项目和基础设施准备得十分充分，但各国对于处理新的卫生挑战几乎束手无策。	Consider the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa: despite ample support programs and infrastructure focused on confronting malaria, countries were not even remotely prepared to handle a new health challenge.
值得注意的是，德国关于美国-欧盟的跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系（TTIP）的争论主要集中在消费者权利和保护国内监管和标准上。	It is notable that the German debate about the US-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership was focused primarily on consumer rights and protecting domestic regulations and standards.
因此很有可能会出现至少有两个决策中心的治理体系。 也许还应该加上统一俄罗斯党，即普京和梅德韦捷夫所在的政党，它在刚刚举行的议会选举中获得了64%的选票，大大超过了2003年37%的得票率。	That implies a system of governance with at least two decision-making centers – perhaps in addition to United Russia, the party of Putin and Medvedev, which won 64% of the vote in the recent parliamentary election up from 37% in 2003.
事实上，在中国1992至2009年家庭总储蓄率（作为GDP的一部分）所增加的20.2%中，中年人群体占了超过60 % （ 余下部分主要由老年人贡献 ） 。	Indeed, of the 20.2-percentage-point increase in aggregate household savings (as a share of GDP) in China from 1992 to 2009, the middle-aged cohort accounted for more than 60% (the remainder was largely attributable to the elderly).
因此，就“记忆的政治”这个词来说，1945年2月13日这个盟军向德累斯顿开火的第60个纪念日，相对于1945年5月8日这个第60个纪念日，便可能是一个更关键性的时刻。	Therefore, the 60th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on 13 February 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German “politics of memory” than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945 is going to be.
欧洲央行进一步拖延利率正常化很可能引发激烈的通货膨胀，给欧洲经济复苏带来灾难性的后果，因为欧洲央行没有其它选择，只能猛踩货币政策的刹车。	Further procrastination on interest-rate normalization by the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation. This would be disastrous for Europe’s economic recovery, as the ECB would have no choice but to slam down hard on the monetary brakes.
叙利亚、伊拉克和利比亚已经名存实亡；它们各自有非常重要的部分已经事实自治并自力更生，不管结果是好是坏。	Syria, Iraq, and Libya are likely to be countries in name only; important parts of each will essentially be autonomous and on their own, for better or worse.
于是，本应是经济学专家的辛格还不如一言不发的旁观者，只知道否认责任和放一些类似于政治局外人的陈词滥调。	Through all of this, the supposedly economically literate Singh was little more than a silent spectator, offering only denials of responsibility or trite remarks from the perspective of a political outsider.
在连续几十年（事实上是几百年）运用这些伎俩之后，物理学家已经忘记了自己其实在模拟某些现象，而非发现绝对真理。	After decades – indeed, centuries – of employing such tricks, physicists have forgotten that they are modeling phenomena, not necessarily uncovering Divine Truth.
如今，联合国难民署（UN High Commission for Refugees）在其全球战略重点（Global Strategic Priorities）中描述了它的目标，并每年评估目标进展情况。	The UN High Commission for Refugees now describes its objectives in its Global Strategic Priorities and evaluates progress toward them annually.
德国法律和政治学家卡尔·施密特（Carl Schmitt）也许会说，特朗普混淆了朋友和敌人，结果用对待后者的方式对待前者。	The German legal and political theorist Carl Schmitt might say that Trump had confused his friend and his enemy, dealing with the former as he should have dealt with the latter.
伯克利 — — 随着数字平台改变劳动力市场运作并彻底改变工作性质，如今的劳动力市场正在发生根本性的转变。	BERKELEY – Today’s labor markets are undergoing radical change, as digital platforms transform how they operate and revolutionize the nature of work.
毫无疑问，领土挑战是一个发展迅速的隐忧，一位美国特使关于阿富汗-巴基斯坦边界的杜兰德线的无伤大雅的玩笑引起了阿巴双方的严重抗议。	The territorial challenge is, no doubt, a mushrooming anxiety; an innocuous remark by an American envoy about the Durand Line, which marks the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, drew sharp retorts from both countries.
在本周在尼日利亚首都阿布贾举行的世界经济论坛上，我和来自商界和公民社会的同仁一道提出了一个保证存在切实紧迫的威胁的地区的学生人生安全的计划。	At the World Economic Forum in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, this week, together with partners from business and civil society, I launched a program to ensure the personal safety of children in areas where the threats to them are real and immediate.
其次，正如欧盟-加拿大全面经济和贸易协定，欧盟和英国所谈判的一切安排都必须经所有欧盟成员国一致接受。	Second, just like the EU’s Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada, any negotiated arrangement between the EU and the UK will have to be unanimously accepted by all EU member states.
一些政府已经开始在遏制AMR的全球行动东起到关键作用，收集大肠杆菌、沙门氏菌和其他常见致病菌耐药菌株蔓延的数据。	And some governments have already started filling critical roles in the global response to AMR, by collecting data on the spread of resistant strains of E. coli, salmonella, and other common pathogens.
在委内瑞拉，前总统科雷拉成功地让自己挑选的继承人当选总统，但低油价和美元短缺意味着极有可能发生政策缓和（policy moderation ） 。	In Ecuador, former president Rafael Correa managed to get his handpicked successor elected, but low oil prices and dollar shortages make a turn toward policy moderation quite likely.
毕竟，它降低了房地产投机的税收 — — 这种活动不曾在任何地方创造持续繁荣，倒是到处制造不平等性加剧。	After all, it lowers taxes on real-estate speculation – an activity that has produced sustainable prosperity nowhere, but has contributed to rising inequality everywhere.
昔日的美联储通常拥有魅力超凡、独断专行的专业中央银行家主席：斯特朗（Benjamin Strong ） 、 艾克尔斯（Marriner Eccles ） 、 马丁（William McChesney Martin ） 、 沃克尔和格林斯潘莫不如此。	The Fed of old usually had a charismatic, autocratic, professional central banker at its head: Benjamin Strong, Marriner Eccles, William McChesney Martin, Paul Volcker, and Alan Greenspan.
今天，我们知道市场充斥着不完善之处 — — 包括信息和竞争的不充分 — — 从而为歧视和剥削提供了充足的机会。	Today, we understand that the market is rife with imperfections – including imperfections of information and competition – that provide ample opportunity for discrimination and exploitation.
虽然人们很容易认可教育和基础设施领域高效益的政府投资在今天看来尤其必要，但由此推定需求将永远限制供给的看法却在很大程度上值得怀疑。	Although one can readily agree that high-yielding government investments in education and infrastructure are especially justified today, the idea that demand permanently constrains supply in a significant way is dubious.
牛津大学的西蒙·任-刘易斯（Simon Wren-Lewis）估算该损失可能高达GDP的15 % 。	Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University estimates that the damage might be as high as 15% of GDP.
如果共和党强制执行某种形式的政府支付排序，完全可能造成政府部分关闭的后果。 有些人将拿到欠款、有些人则不能。	As a result, a partial government shutdown is entirely possible, with the Republicans imposing a form of prioritization on government payments: some people will be paid what they are owed, and others will not.
在2008~2013年共处协议期间及以后，在津巴布韦经济复苏后，又如何阻止未来的选举多数人再次抢夺那些经济复苏者的资产？	What will prevent a future electoral majority from grabbing assets again after the economy recovers, as happened in Zimbabwe during and after the 2008-2013 cohabitation agreement?
从这个角度看，埃博拉是 — — 或者说曾经是 — — 有时被称为90/10法则的一个例子：90%的医学研究被用于只占全球疾病负担10%的疾病。	In this respect, Ebola is – or, rather, was – an example of what is sometimes referred to as the 90/10 rule: 90% of medical research is directed toward illnesses that comprise only 10% of the global burden of disease.
我在周游欧洲、支持针对欧盟极权主义的泛欧洲运动时感到，德国、爱尔兰和葡萄牙这些截然不同的地方都涌现出巨大的国际主义浪潮。	As I travel across Europe, advocating a pan-European movement to confront the EU’s authoritarianism, I sense a great surge of internationalism in places as different from one another as Germany, Ireland, and Portugal.
推翻萨达姆（至少他们曾经希望）会自然而然地带来某种程度的稳定，而稳定会有助于最终解决该地区的其它冲突，还能确保石油能够不受干扰地流动。	This (they hoped) would automatically bring about a degree of stability that would help resolve other conflicts in the region, and also guarantee the uninterrupted flow of oil.
正如旧金山联邦储备银行的奥斯卡·乔达（Òscar Jordà ） ， 莫里茨·舒拉里克（Moritz Schularick）和艾伦·M·泰勒（Alan M. Taylor）所揭示的那样，发达经济体的私人 — — 特别是家庭 — — 信贷相对GDP比率长期以来都在上升。	As the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor have shown, there has been a long-term secular increase in private – particularly household – credit-to-GDP ratios across advanced economies.
自2008年金融危机以来，战后自由秩序陷入了严重的麻烦。 金融危机削弱了西方经济体，也冲击了全球治理机构和监管当局。	The post-war liberal order has been in serious trouble since the 2008 financial crisis, which weakened Western economies and undermined global-governance bodies and regulatory institutions.
新预算将向一个尚未明确界定的项目投入资金和资源，这个名为“近地球物体”的项目，目的在于登上月球之外的行星，最终到达火星。	The new budget will apply the freed-up funds and resources towards a still-to-be-defined program aimed at going beyond the Moon to asteroids, so-called “near-Earth objects,” and, eventually, Mars.
考���到共和党参众两院都赢得了多数，并且在州级别选举中也大获全胜，特朗普与共和党建制派的关系缓和对于实施促增长政策十分有利。	Given that Republicans won a majority in both houses of Congress and gained further ground at the state level, Trump’s détente with the party establishment bodes well for the enactment of his pro-growth policies.
政府在略长于两周的时间里就推动了这一立法，只是象征性地征求了公众意见，甚至连合理的公共辩论都没有时间进行。	The government pushed the proposal through in a little more than two weeks, with only token public consultation and no time for reasoned public debate.
20世纪80年代，保守派英雄罗纳德·里根不惜忍受巨额赤字为其雄心勃勃的减税计划融资，并且他是在借贷成本一点都不便宜的时期这么做的。	Back in the 1980s, conservative hero Ronald Reagan was willing to tolerate enormous deficits to fund his ambitious tax-cutting plans, and he did so in an era when borrowing wasn’t cheap.
他们的思想处在一个日益扩大的认知前沿，即法国必须直面世界的真实挑战，而不能按照法国人自己的意愿歪曲它们。	Their thinking is at the forefront of a widening recognition that France must face the world’s challenges as they really are, not as the French want them to be.
不过虽然这可以解释高技术和“非技术”工人（以其是否受过大学教育来界定）之间不断扩大的工资或收入差距，却无法解释最富有的那1％和其他人之间的差距。	But, while this can explain a widening wage or income gap between skilled and “unskilled” workers (defined according to whether they are college-educated), this has little to do with the gap between the top 1% and the rest.
俄罗斯和中国正在地缘政治领域重新执行19世纪标准，即各国在肆无忌惮民族主义和僵化国家主权制度下开展硬实力竞争。	In geopolitical terms, Russia and China are reenacting the norms of the nineteenth-century, when states competed by amassing hard power in a system of unbridled nationalism and rigid state sovereignty.
总体而言，学校教育和计划生育可以在未来30年减少1200亿吨的二氧化碳排放量，因为人口的减少将减轻资源消耗的压力。	Taken together, schooling and family planning could translate into a 120-gigaton reduction in carbon dioxide emissions over the next three decades, as fewer people consumed fewer resources.
此外，消灭一项扭曲可能效果并不好甚至产生反作用：对于一个问题在租的经济，局部改革的唯一后果可能是让租在不同的部门和行为人之间游走，而不是将之减少从而有利于消费者。	Moreover, eliminating one distortion may be ineffective or even counterproductive: in an economy plagued with rents, partial reform may simply result in shifting them across sectors and agents, rather than reducing them to the benefit of consumers.
《概要》结束了自1976年三木武夫政府起保留至今的“全面禁止政策 ” ， 取消了一些愚蠢的武器出口禁止。	The Guideline lifted some of the more foolish limits on arms exports by ending the “all-out prohibition policy” maintained since the Miki Administration of 1976.
两年后，美国政府问责办公室（US Government Accountability Office）在经过长期的调查后认定DTC遗传测试提供了“误导性”结果 — — 而“欺骗性营销”让这一局面更加复杂了。	Two years later, the US Government Accountability Office concluded after a lengthy investigation that DTC genetic tests provide “misleading” results – a situation that is complicated further by “deceptive marketing.”
没有一份报告可以建立一个更加安全的世界，但是怀有这一目标的人们一定希望政府和他们的公众会认真地考虑名人小组的建议。	No single report can create a more secure world, but those who support that goal must hope that governments and their publics will consider seriously the Panel’s recommendations.
土耳其七月份将要举行议会选举，比原定的时间提前了四个月，这样勉强避免在选择国家的下一任总统问题上的宪法危机。	Turkey will hold its parliamentary election in July, four months earlier than scheduled, thereby narrowly avoiding a constitutional crisis over the choice of the country’s next president.
这些地区的投资能改善和扩大土地利用 — — 不管是通过释放未使用土地还是开发区块以支持更多居民 — — 从而有助于降低住房成本。	Investment in these areas would improve and expand land use – whether by unlocking unused land or equipping areas to support more inhabitants – thereby helping to reduce housing costs.
这些激励措施的代价将会是温和的而效益将会是巨大的，而且可以被用来保护穷人并将气候变化的负担转移到那些有能力支付的人身上。	Those incentives will come at modest cost and huge benefit, and they can be designed to protect the poor and shift the climate-change burden to those who can afford it.
杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）成功地保住了CEO和董事长的双重职位，但此事件所显露的更大问题在于董事会本身，这个问题影响着世界上几乎所有大银行。	Regardless of Jamie Dimon’s victory in retaining his dual role as CEO and chairman of the board, the more important failure on display was that of the board of directors itself – a problem that affects almost all of the world’s megabanks.
有鉴于在许多人看来是引发金融危机的原因之一的贸易不平衡，未来的最大挑战之一就是使这两个国家的储蓄（习惯）合理化。	One of the great challenges ahead is to find a way to bring these two countries’ savings into line, given the vast trade imbalances that many believe planted the seeds of financial crisis.
对欧洲领导人来说，利比亚已经变成了一个拥有数十亿美元石油和投资合同的风水宝地，而欧洲对卡扎菲政权的重新认可却并未包括任何能缓解其国内政治高压的交换条件。	Libya has become a Mecca for European leaders trying to win multi-billion dollar oil and investment deals. The rehabilitation of the Qaddafi regime has never included any push to ease political repression in Libya.
德黑兰政权必须展示对外力量，才能闯过国内合法性遭到破坏的难关，这会使西方力求达到的综合谈判解决方案更难更危险，甚至根本不可能实现。	A regime in Tehran that must demonstrate external strength to survive its shattered legitimacy at home would therefore make the comprehensive, negotiated settlement that the West seeks much more difficult and risky, if not impossible, to achieve.
尽管免疫计划只需要花费卫生预算的相对较小比例，并且能够带来极高的经济回报，但保证所需资金仍然需要仔细的规划。	Although immunization programs require only a relatively small share of health budgets and yield exceptionally high economic returns, securing the needed financing requires careful planning.
与他对叙利亚沙林毒气袭击的系统1反应相反，1962年10月肯尼迪总统及其顾问团队赫鲁晓夫在古巴部署核弹采取了非常周祥的反应。	Contrast his System 1 response to the sarin attack with the very deliberate reaction in October 1962 by President John F. Kennedy and his advisers to Nikita Khrushchev’s siting of nuclear missiles in Cuba.
此外，由于这些企业的力量来自信息，因此，它们可以通过将客户隐私信息作为战略资产的能力强化自己的地位。	In addition, because these firms derive their power from information, their positions are enhanced by their ability to use their customers’ private information as a strategic asset.
今天重新引入这一机制需要更大规模的政府融资支持，至少从一开始是如此，但从长期看，这能够带来可持续的、自我满足的体系。	While reintroducing such a scheme today would demand even greater government financial support, at least at first, in the long run, it would create a sustainable and self-sufficient system.
如果人们重新计算将来收益的当前净值，多哈回合现实的结果可能会每年增加全球收入3万亿美元，其中的2万5千亿美元将会流入发展中国家。	Recast as after calculating the net present value of the stream of future benefits, a realistic Doha outcome could increase global income by more than $3000 billion per year, $2500 billion of which would go to the developing world.
简言之，中国政府将路径与最终目的混淆了起来 — — 我在我对中国发展高层论坛的评论中强调过这一点。 我在评论中指出，中国正处在经济向服务和消费再平衡的早期阶段。	In short, China’s government is confusing a path with the final destination – a point that I stressed in my remarks to the CDF, in which I argued that China is in the early stages of rebalancing its economy toward services and consumption.
从1931年9月开始，市场紧张起美国来了，出现了资本从美国各银行大规模流出的现象 — — 也就是逃离美元。	Beginning in September 1931, the markets became nervous about the US, causing large outflows from American banks – and thus from the dollar.
尽管国民收入有了快速增加，但如果领导人不能公平地分配经济增长到来的好处，他们就很容易受到群众的反对。	Even with rapid increases in national income, if these countries’ leaders do not distribute the benefits fairly, they will become vulnerable to popular discontent.
该法有关侵犯人权行为中妇女儿童幸存者和因性取向而遭袭者的特别规定甚至得到了联合国驻哥伦比亚高级人权专员的赞誉。	It even drew praise from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia for its special provisions for women and children survivors of human rights abuses, and for those targeted for their perceived sexual orientation.
在一个成熟的民主国家，这种变化往往是在经济危机之后发生的，公民们会投票选出了一些致力于改革的新领导层。	In a mature democracy, such change often comes after an economic crisis, with citizens voting for new leadership that has committed to implementing reforms.
一些人可能认为特朗普将沙特阿拉伯而不是以色列作为其以美国总统身份出访的第一个目的地的决定表明他对中东地区持有新的观点（尽管他随后马上就会去以色列 ） 。	Some might argue that Trump’s decision to make Saudi Arabia, rather than Israel, the destination of his first trip abroad as US president reflects a new view of the region (though he will head to Israel immediately after).
欧洲领导人放任他们最有用的维持和平以及促成变革的工具 — — 那个一度受到尊敬的 高级代表办公室 — — 无所作为，以致许多波斯尼亚官员都带着蔑视来看待这些代表。	European leaders have allowed their most useful tool for preserving the peace and leveraging change – the once-respected office of the High Representative – to be diminished to the point that many Bosnian officials treat the incumbent with disdain.
这种民族主义的爆发是否会很快平息取决于该区域 — — 不仅仅是中国 — — 各国政府是否愿意去采取一个立场并呼吁本国公众把情绪平息下来。	Whether this outbreak of nationalism will end soon depends on the willingness of governments in the region – not just China’s – to take a stand and appeal to their publics to cease and desist.
在这方面，实现环境补救、提高农业群体抵御灾害的能力以及推动可持续农业生产和支持以社区为基础的环境管理工作都已经取得了显著的效果。	On this front, efforts to achieve environmental remediation, to boost the resilience of rural communities, to advance sustainable agricultural production, and to support community-based environmental stewardship have all shown promising results.
影响力投资一词由世界上最古老的慈善机构之一 — — 洛克菲勒基金会赞助的一次2007年的会议上被提出。	Impact investing – a term coined in 2007 at a conference sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the oldest traditional philanthropies – is another.
过去25年来重塑了全球经济的大部分数字化创新都依赖网络连接，而网络连接也改变了商业，通信，教育培训，供应链等行业的形态。	Most of the digital innovations that have reshaped the global economy over the last 25 years rely on network connectivity, which has transformed commerce, communication, education and training, supply chains, and much more.
但当该银行公布上半年亏损36亿欧元时，信心的突然崩溃值得警惕，紧张的投资者想弄清楚其他地方是否也有滴答走动的定时炸弹。	But when the bank announced a first-half loss of €3.6 billion ($4.7 billion), the sudden collapse of confidence was alarming, and nervous investors are asking whether there are similar time bombs ticking elsewhere.
这在萨尔柯齐公开的亲美立场中有所反映¾在今天反美主义甚嚣尘上的法国，采取这样的立场需要很大的政治勇气。	This is reflected in Sarkozy’s openly pro-American stance – an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is running high.
2013年，非盟发布了信息接触示范法，如今，它应该为各国提供新的指引，教它们如何捍卫在线收集和表达观点的权利。	Just as it launched a model law on access to information in 2013, the African Union should provide new guidance to states on how to safeguard the right to assemble and express views online.
2011年，政府担心突尼斯和埃及的状况 — — 长期独裁统治被推翻蔓延到阿尔及利亚，对公共部门员工示威蔓延的反应是提高100%的薪水，这在2008年算得上逆潮流而动。	In 2011, the government, fearing contagion from Tunisia and Egypt, where long-established dictatorships had just been toppled, responded to the spread of protests by public-sector workers by raising their salaries by 100% – retroactively to 2008.
这对夫妇确实带走了这名男婴的双胞胎姐姐，他们的行为明确告诉外界他们为之支付费用的是婴儿本身（或者是符合其要求的一两名婴儿 ） ， 而并非母���所提供的“服务 ” 。	The couple did take the boy’s twin sister, however, making it clear that what they had paid for was not the “service” provided by the mother, but the children themselves – or rather, just the one who met their requirements.
被质疑进行国际干预的政府急切地渴望更加严格的全球规则以防止银行危机溢出国界，像亚洲流感一样传染给其他国家。	Governments that had been suspicious of international interference were eager for tougher global rules to prevent banking crises from spilling across borders and infecting others, like bouts of Asian flu.
如果任由这种趋势持续下去，有可能每年造成GDP缩减1 % ， 并同时侵犯民众的隐私、言论自由和知识获取。	If this trend continues, it could cost more than 1% of GDP per year, and also impinge on peoples’ privacy, free speech, and access to knowledge.
事实上，美联储决定推迟升息的部分原因正是美国决策者预期美元升值将拉低进口品价格，从而妨碍其实现2%通胀目标的能力。	Indeed, the Fed decided to delay raising interest rates partly because US policymakers expect dollar appreciation, by lowering import prices, to undermine their ability to meet their 2% inflation target.
在想像中，腐败形式要比斯洛文尼亚、捷克共和国、匈牙利和希腊糟糕很多。 而在实际腐败指标上，它好很多，至少不会更差。	On perception, it fares much worse than Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Greece, while it fares better – or at least not worse – on indicators of actual corruption.
邓小平暂时退隐，让围绕在党元老陈云身边的主张计划经济的人士放慢市场化脚步，并在后天安门事件时期国际上孤立中国的形势下韬光养晦。	Deng temporarily withdrew, letting the central planners around Party elder Chen Yun slow down marketization and weather the PRC’s international isolation in Tiananmen’s wake.
那么，决策者 — — 特别是发达国家决策者 — — 应该如何面对这一新的就业大挑战（以及反过来对收入和财富分配的挑战）呢？	How, then, should policymakers confront the new and difficult challenges for employment (and, in turn, for the distribution of income and wealth), especially in developed economies?
此外，由于太阳能发电厂可以独立于复杂的集成电网运行，因此也为欠发达国家提供了一条不必建设昂贵的新基础设施就可以给经济带来电力的道路。	And, because solar plants can generally be operated independently of complex interregional electricity grids, they provide less developed countries a way to electrify their economies without building expensive new infrastructure.
德国情报局（German Intelligence Agency）的一份最新机密研究认为，事实上，到2020年，美国便可能成为石油和天然气出口国，而目前它仍是世界第一大能源进口国。	A recent confidential study by the German Intelligence Agency raises the possibility that the US could actually become an oil and gas exporter by 2020, in contrast to its present position as the world’s largest energy importer.
首先，我们现在知道适应气候变化非常重要，因为即便我们明天就停止温室气体排放，到2100年全球温度还是会再上升0.6°C。	First, we now know that adaptation will be essential, because temperatures will rise by another 0.6°C by 2100 even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow.
虽然1990年已经实现了极端贫困人口减半，但2015年要想实现营养不良减半的目标其进展还需要大大加快。	Although the share of people living in extreme poverty in 1990 was halved by 2010, progress will have to accelerate considerably to halve the prevalence of under-nutrition by 2015.
鉴于如此愚蠢的政策并平均所有宏观经济模型，欧盟每年耗资2800亿美元挽回200亿美元损失的可能性更大。	Taking into account such poor policies and averaging all macroeconomic models, the EU is more likely to pay around $280 billion per year to avert $10 billion in damage.
许多观察人士认为，美国借助长期经常账户赤字对世界其他地区做出了巨大贡献 — — 也就是支撑了大量经常遭受国内需求短缺困扰的盈余国家。	Many observers believe that the US is doing the rest of the world a huge favor by running chronic current-account deficits – namely, supporting the large surplus countries, which tend to suffer from a shortfall of domestic demand.
值此六十周年纪念庆典之际，最重要的是敦促我们的领导人对这项任务所涉及的范围有一个清醒的认识，并致力于采取可持续措施来建设机构能力以达到保护人权的目的，而这一切就从他们自己的国家开始。	Nothing on this anniversary is more important than to urge our leaders to recognize the scale of the task and commit to sustained action to build institutional capacities to protect human rights, starting in their own countries.
新德里—孟加拉国首都达卡Shahbag区陷入了人民战争的海洋，示威者提出了不同寻常的要求 — — 至少是印度次大陆不同寻常的要求。	NEW DELHI – The sea of humanity besieging the Shahbag area in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, for the last two months, has had an unusual demand – unusual, at least, for the Indian subcontinent.
1980年，在一封名为《祖国在危险中 》 （ The Homeland Is in Danger）的公开信中，历史学家雅各布·塔尔蒙（Jacob Talmon）试图与总理贝金（Menachem Begin）分享这个简单的教训。	In 1980, in a famous open letter entitled “The Homeland Is in Danger,” the historian Jacob Talmon tried to share this simple lesson with Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
这在遵守和强制方面显得特别明显， 2001—2002年阿根廷经济危机导致大量针对它的案件涌向ICSID，这一问题也暴露无遗。	This was especially evident concerning compliance and enforcement, and matters came to a head with the deluge of cases brought against Argentina stemming from its 2001-2002 economic crisis.
这些问题都已被加入了修订版的条约中，它们分别是1972年的海豹保护公约，之后是1980年的野生动物保护公约。	These were added to a revised treaty in 1972 by a convention on seal protection, followed, in 1980, by a convention on wildlife preservation.
分割耶路撒冷，巴勒斯坦难民并不返回古代家园，而西岸地带的犹太人定居点将会像加沙地带那样拆除或者(难以想像地)自我防卫。	Jerusalem will be divided, Palestinian refugees will not return to their ancestral homes, and Jewish settlements in the West Bank will, like their Gaza counterparts, be dismantled or (inconceivably) left to fend for themselves.
流通于欧元区的所有资金都产生于这五个国家，并随后大部分用于购买北欧成员国商品和资产以及偿还外国债务。	All the money circulating in the eurozone originated in these five countries and was then largely used to buy goods and assets in the northern member countries and redeem foreign debt taken from them.
因此，不久前公布的对其有效性的质疑令人震惊 — — 同样令人震惊的还有去年2月发表的加拿大国家乳腺筛查研究25年随访记录。	That is why recent doubts about its effectiveness – intensified by the publication in February of the 25-year follow-up to the Canadian National Breast Screening Study – have come as such a shock.
而将印度的成就衬托得更为引人注目的，在巴基斯坦恐怖分子于2008年11月对孟买 — — 印度的经济神经中枢和商业首都 — — 的袭击事件。	India’s achievement is all the more striking given that the Pakistani terrorist attacks on Mumbai – India’s financial nerve center and commercial capital – in late November 2008 came in the midst of the crisis.
另一个相反的政策选项是防御性的攻击：对伊朗境内与核计划相关的基地发动军事进攻（最有可能由以色列、美国或两国一起发动攻击。	At the opposite end of the spectrum of policy choices is a preventive attack: a military strike (most likely by Israel, the US, or both) against sites in Iran associated with its nuclear program.
这个教训对于其它先进国家如德国和法国，更是有着强大的警示作用，这两个国家在公共项目上的开支所占国民生产总值的比例（ 2005年分别为35 ％和43 ％ ， ）远远超过了美国（只有25 ％ ） 。	That lesson is even more powerful for other advanced countries like Germany and France, which spend a far higher percentage of GDP on public programs (35% and 43%, respectively, in 2005) than the US (only 25%).
随着美国支持的动摇，非洲和欧洲政府、基金会、捐助机构和从业人员必须随时准备协助非洲农户建设长期适应性。	As US support waivers, African and European governments, foundations, institutional donors, and practitioners must be ready to step in to help African farmers build long-term resiliency.
如今，CDU/CSU和SPD正在寻求结成执政大联盟，如若成功，德国将继续沿着和过去八年大体相当的道路前进。	The CDU/CSU and the SPD are now pursuing a grand coalition that would keep Germany roughly on the same path it has taken during the last eight years.
沙特家族的一些支系正在接触 — — 尽管十分谨慎 — — 公民社会活动家，试图让他们参与关于沙特阿拉伯未来的对话。	And some factions of the Saudi family are reaching out – albeit cautiously – to civil-society actors, attempting to engage them in a dialogue about the country’s future.
但由前苏联和其他国家组成的欧亚关税联盟绝不是俄罗斯的现代化之路；其将国防业作为工业化引擎的方针亦然。	But a Eurasian customs union among post-Soviet and other countries is not the road to modernization for Russia; nor is an effort to make the defense industry the engine of industrialization.
在过去的四十年里，世界人口将近翻了一番，达到了70亿。 但全球受到热带风暴影响的人口数量却上涨了2倍。	Over the last 40 years, the world’s population has almost doubled, to seven billion, but global exposure to tropical cyclones has almost tripled.
但据人权观察组织（Human Rights Watch）的数据，去年“泰国军政府加紧把持权力，严重迫害基本权利 ” 。	Yet according to Human Rights Watch, “Thailand’s military junta tightened its grip on power and severely repressed fundamental rights” last year.
只要核武器依然存在，不正视使用核武器的后果就是不负责任的。 世界上没有任何解药或保险能够化解这种后果。	As long as nuclear weapons exist, it is irresponsible not to confront the implications of their use – implications for which there is no antidote or insurance policy.
全球阿波罗计划将让这些投资提高一倍，并协调弥补技术缺口的努力，让我们告别煤炭和其他碳密集型燃料的日子提前。	The Global Apollo Program would double these investments and coordinate the effort to bridge the technological gaps, bringing forward the day when we could eliminate coal and other carbon-intensive fuels.
同一天，黎巴嫩总理哈里里在利雅得的电视直播现场宣布辞职，指责伊朗对其他国家的干预导致了“灾难和混乱 ” 。	On the same day, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation in a live television broadcast from Riyadh, accusing Iran of causing “devastation and chaos” through its meddling in other countries.
当美联储真的开始升息时，一些经济体将比其他经济体受到更大的冲击；但是，除了少数不具备系统重要性的例外，大面积灾难和危机不一定会发生。	When it does, some will suffer more than others; but, with a few exceptions lacking systemic importance, widespread distress and crises need not occur.
但他们争吵和犹豫的时间越长，他们在“为”方面所取得的进展因“能”方面的欠缺而沦为于事无补的风险就越大。	But the longer they bicker and dither, the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to incapacity.
美联储正试图迫使外国银行建立一个控股公司，下属各单独资本化了的子公司，这能有效地让美联储直接监督他们的业务。	The Fed is seeking to oblige foreign banks to create a holding company to own their separately capitalized subsidiaries, effectively giving the Fed direct oversight of their business.
对除此之外的发展中世界而言，真正的大患不是需求不足；而是需要维持高生产率增长率，以使它们可以赶超发达经济体。	For the rest of the developing world, the real worry is not a shortfall of demand; it is the need to sustain high rates of productivity growth so that they can catch up with the advanced economies.
当前的工资保险提议的弱点在于：该保险仅为一段有限的时间支付福利，并且依赖于对自己创造的再培训动力的长期效果。	The weakness of the current wage insurance proposal is that it pays benefits only for a limited period and relies for its long-term effect on the retraining incentives that it creates.
但正如巴基斯坦在2011到2012年所学到的那样，这样的举动将会伤害其本国经济，尤其是军方主导的货运业。	But, as Pakistan learned in 2011-2012, such a move would hurt its own economy, especially its military-dominated trucking industry.
在人工智能时代，算法将迫使我们清晰地认识过往社会和政治冲突的结果如何能够通过我们对数据的利用而延续到现在。	In the age of AI, algorithms will force us to recognize how the outcomes of past social and political conflicts have been perpetuated into the present through our use of data.
近二十年后，内塔尼亚胡仍然坚持着陈旧而毫无意义的“统一的耶路撒冷”的口号 — — 这一决心可能再次让以色列-巴勒斯坦和平进程流产。	Nearly two decades later, Netanyahu remains committed to old, vacuous slogans about a “united Jerusalem” – a conviction that could, yet again, unravel the Israel-Palestine peace process.
或许金融家和经济学家不能预知这次金融危机，但是，其他那些关注市场发展的人 — — 通常带着惊慌 — — 就不仅仅只是担忧了。	Perhaps not by financiers and economists, but others who were watching how markets were developing – often with dismay – were more than worried.
随着新闻内容越来越狭隘地迎合个人兴趣和偏好，加之人们越来越多地选择信任和追随某个人，传统的专业知识分享的渠道正在被打乱。	With news becoming more narrowly targeted to individual interests and preferences, and with people increasingly choosing whom to trust and follow, the traditional channels for sharing expertise are being disrupted.
毕竟，权衡直面不相关的外部暴力势力的利弊是一回事；猛烈打击带政治目的的、令人不快的野蛮影像的炮制者是另一回事。	After all, it is one thing to deliberate on the pros and cons of confronting external forces of irrational violence; it is something else to lash out against the producers of brutal, politically charged, and upsetting imagery.
从这一点出发，美国个人所得税制度的一个缺陷是最底层和最顶层的边际税率太高，前者是因为福利计划，后者是因为累进率结构。	From this perspective, a shortcoming of the US individual income-tax system is that marginal tax rates are high at the bottom (because of means testing of welfare programs) and the top (because of the graduated-rate structure).
贝阿铁路 — — 就像伏尔加格勒的祖国母亲在召唤（Motherland Calls）纪念碑，莫斯科的无名战士墓和胜利公园的长明之火，以及列阵于铁路沿线的巨型水力发电站 — — 是曾经强大的苏联的象征。	The BAM – like the Motherland Calls statue in Volgograd, the eternal flames at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and Victory Park in Moscow, and the giant hydroelectric plants that line the train’s route – is a symbol of the once-mighty Soviet Union.
尽管它并未暗示何时利率会上升以及会升到何种程度，但国会预算办公室（CBO）预计，十年期美国国债利率将在2019年升至5%以上，并在未来五年中一直高于5 % 。	Although it has not indicated just when rates will rise or how high they will go, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the rate on ten-year Treasuries will rise above 5% by 2019 and remain above that level for the next five years.
与此同时，也必须考虑拒绝土耳其的危险：改革进程可能半途而废、极端势力可能走到前台，在欧洲大门口造成局势不稳和政治动荡。	At the same time, the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account: the likelihood that the reform process would collapse, bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU's doorsteps.
这种思维方式意味着，尽管城市里连绵不断的空中轮廓线，广告牌和华丽的五星级酒店诉说着中国的变化与发展，但要真正理解并珍惜其实际的成就和地位，中国还有很长一段路要走。	This mindset suggests that, despite the panoramic city skylines, the billboards, and the flashy five-star hotels say otherwise, China has a long way to go before it truly comes to understand and appreciate its actual accomplishments and status.
他可以首先告诉自己那些自命不凡的民主对手，俄国人对他普京的支持率远比他们在各自国家的支持率高出许多。	He could start by pointing out to his smugly democratic counterparts that he is probably more popular in Russia today than any of them are in their own countries.
但 — — 这是难题所在 — — 欧洲央行缺乏足够的选项去刺激欧元区偿付能力较强机构的需求，也因此难以支撑经济的可持续复苏。	But – and this is the conundrum – the ECB has few options for stimulating demand among the eurozone’s more solvent agents, and thus supporting a sustainable recovery.
这样做会可能让投资者处于和皮博迪能源公司（Peabody Energy）最后的股东相同的境地。 皮博迪能源公司是世界上最大的私有煤炭公司，目前正处于破产边缘。	Doing so risks putting investors in the same position as the last shareholders in Peabody Energy, the world’s largest private coal company, which is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.
首先，需要有一个彻底取代性旧体制的，高度复杂的系统来保护世界气候，正如20年前在后共产主义国家中所需要的那种颠覆性的变革。	First, a thoroughgoing alteration of highly complex systems will be needed to preserve the world’s climate, just as such root-and-branch changes were needed 20 years ago in the postcommunist countries.
更令人担心的是，在特朗普准备提名蒂勒森的消息曝出的同一天 ， 《 华盛顿邮报》报道中央情报局得出一个令人不安的结论：俄罗斯干预了美国总统大选，帮助特朗普获胜。	More worrying, the news of Trump’s intention to nominate Tillerson emerged on the same day that the Washington Post reported the CIA’s disturbing conclusion that Russia had interfered in the presidential election to help Trump win.
2014年，为受埃博拉疫情影响的利比里亚提供援助的德国人道主义团队被困在了加那利群岛（Canary Islands ） 。	In 2014, Germany’s humanitarian team to deliver assistance to Ebola-stricken Liberia was stranded in the Canary Islands.
因此，一个成功的多哈回合谈判将会是对现有国际合作努力的有力支持，在国际货币基金组织的参与下，还能应对世界主要经济体之间的外部不平衡。	A successful Doha Round would thus complement the international collaborative efforts underway, with IMF involvement, to tackle external imbalances among the major economies.
传统的智慧很难应对一个设计良好的压力测试。 在过去的24个月中，很少有这样的压力测试像全球经济经历了那次危机那样难以对付。	One piece of bubble wisdom that has escaped relatively unscathed, however, is the assumption that the “BRIC” countries – Brazil, Russia, India, and China – will increasingly call the economic tune in years to come.
比如说对患者造成严重及持久困扰的三大医学病症 — — 抑郁症，慢性疼痛和睡眠障碍 — — 其实都可以被成功治愈并极大地缓解患者的痛苦。	For example, three medical afflictions that create especially acute and enduring distress – clinical depression, chronic pain, and sleep disorders – are all conditions that can often be treated successfully, to the vast relief of sufferers.
世界银行和比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会等出资者用GBD的数据指导投资，30多个国家已开展了各自的疾病负担研究。	Donors such as the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation use GBD data to guide their investments, and more than 30 countries have conducted their own burden-of-disease studies.
少数观察家怀疑中国将在未来十年中的某个时间点被迫随人民币汇率自由浮动，问题则是在这一过渡期间会因为政治和经济规则发生冲突而产生多少乱象。	Few observers doubt that China will have to let the renminbi exchange rate float freely sometime over the next decade. The question is how much drama will take place in the interim, as political and economic imperatives collide.
我们的乌克兰经验表明，作用于批判性思维、个体和群体心理和社会信任水平的多层次方法，相较简单的事实核实，更能够抵御假新闻。	Our experience in Ukraine demonstrates that a multi-layered approach, working at the levels of critical thinking, individual and group psychology, and social trust, provides a better defense against fake news than simple fact checking.
麦肯锡国际研究院的模拟研究表明，未来五年这些成本将占到潜在总收益的80 % ， 而到2030年却将下降至潜在总收益的1/3左右。	MGI’s simulation suggests that these costs will amount to 80% of gross potential gains in five years, but will decline to one-third of those gains by 2030.
发自新德里 — — 不知西方在干涉利比亚过程中的所产生“使命偏离效应 ” （ mission creep，意指行动偏离原定目标）是否会无意中在欧洲的南大门外孕育出一个伊斯兰圣战大本营呢？	NEW DELHI – Will “mission creep” in the West’s intervention in Libya end up creating, inadvertently, a jihadist citadel at Europe’s southern doorstep?
此外，美国应制定一个国家层面的全民收入保险计划，以帮助因失业，残疾，疾病或家庭成员死亡而面临财政困境的人。	In addition, the US should develop a national, universal income-insurance program to assist those facing financial insecurity as a result of unemployment, disability, illness, or the death of a family member.
在这些挑战中居于首要地位的是全球变暖，中国已经超越美国成为二氧化碳第一大排放国（虽然从人均角度衡量并非如此 ） 。	Chief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warming, with China having surpassed the US as the leading producer of carbon-dioxide emissions (though not in per capita terms).
但是，我们并没有从增加我们生存能力的特征中获得优势，而是从潜在伴侣进化出来的寻找吸引力的品质中获得优势。	But, instead of gaining an advantage from traits that enhance one’s ability to survive, one gains an advantage from qualities that potential mates have evolved to find appealing.
如今普京和安倍有更多空间谈判存在争议的北方四岛地位，并制定未来经济合作框架 — — 可能包括定期双边峰会。	Now, Putin and Abe will have more room to negotiate the contested islands’ status, and to develop a future framework for economic cooperation, which will likely include regular bilateral summits.
我们知道即使在美国士兵继续在世界其他地方执行多样化和难度极大的任务的同时，我们也必须继续竭尽全力保持并强化我们在太平洋地区的参与力度。	We know that we must continue working to sustain and strengthen our engagement in the Pacific, even as US soldiers continue to carry out diverse and demanding missions in other parts of the world.
当今建造于阿布古奈姆山上，用来切断伯利恒至耶路撒冷之间路径的霍马山犹太人定居点，就生活着1.9万犹太定居者。	Today, Har Homa, built on Jabal Abu Ghnaim with the aim of cutting off Bethlehem from Jerusalem, is home to 19,000 settlers.
此外，他们必须修建新的输电线路，以满足将低碳太阳能、风能、地热和水力发电从偏远地区（及海上平台）输送到人口中心的需求。	Moreover, they must meet the need for new power lines to carry low-carbon solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power from remote areas (and offshore platforms) to population centers.
尽管中产阶级所面临的挑战早已耳熟能详，美国领导人始终无法充分理解中产阶级家庭的困难，更不用说实施有效的应对手段了。	Though the challenges facing the middle class are well documented, US leaders have largely failed to recognize fully the struggles of middle-class households, much less implement effective countermeasures.
但如果该报告不被广泛阅读 — — 以及更重要的，不被广泛研究 — — 将是一件巨大的憾事，因为它包含了一些关于外交如何操作、政策如何制定、决策如何做出的有用洞见。	But it would be a shame if the Report were not widely read and, more important, studied, because it contains some useful insights into how diplomacy operates, how policy is made, and how decisions are taken.
尽管2015年执政期刚刚结束的公民纲领党起源于20世纪80年代的团结运动，但它却因为推行加剧经济不平等的激进的新自由主义经济政策而背叛了原有的工人阶级选民阵营。	Although the Civic Platform, which governed until 2015, grew out of the Solidarity movement of the 1980s, it betrayed its working-class base by pursuing radical neoliberal economic policies that increased economic inequality.
贯彻这项协议会比推行其他举措更能安定乌克兰民众对其欧洲未来的信心，并说服克里姆林宫它无法成功击溃欧洲的价值体系。	To follow through would do more to anchor Ukrainians’ confidence in their European future, and to convince the Kremlin that it cannot succeed in rolling back European values, than anything else the EU might do.
但是，在一个资本可以流动的世界里，提高公司税率（或维持现有水平不变）无益于增加岁入，无益于增进税收制度的累进性质，也无益于帮助美国工人。	But, in a world of mobile capital, raising the corporate tax rate – or simply leaving it at its current level – would be a bad way to generate revenue, a bad way to increase the tax system’s progressivity, and a bad way to help American workers.
根据2009年完成的最新的（被高度政治化的）人口普查，内罗毕人口超过300万；但也许其人口有接近500万，其中很大一部分生活在贫民窟。	According to the last (highly politicized) census, completed in 2009, Nairobi has a population of over three million; but it is probably closer to five million, with a large percentage living in slums.
在奥斯曼帝国收缩而巴尔干地区的历史和种族-民族主义身份定义卷土重来之后，马其顿在希腊，保加利亚和塞尔维亚之间分成了三块，其人民自身的原有身份也遭到了压制。	After the rollback of the Ottoman Empire and the resurgence of historical and ethno-nationalist identities in the Balkans, Macedonia was divided between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia, and its people’s own inchoate identity was suppressed.
世界遗产是无价之宝，它们 — — 事实上，还有我们的地球 — — 的未来依赖迅速降低导致气候变化的温室气体排放。	The future of priceless World Heritage sites – and, indeed, our planet – depends on the immediate reduction of climate-change-inducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
编制准确的资产负债表 — — 尽管这种知识十分重要，但却在多数城市欠缺得令人震惊 — — 是朝着采取以管理为中心策略迈出的关键步骤。	Compiling an accurate balance sheet – knowledge that is, despite its importance, shockingly rare in most cities – is a crucial step toward adopting a management-focused approach.
现在，记忆法已经成为试图巩固自身力量 — — 并煽动曾经为大屠杀提供肥沃土壤的一模一样的仇外民族主义的民族民粹主义者最偏爱的工具之一。	Now, memory laws have become one of the preferred instruments of nationalist populists attempting to consolidate their own power – and to incite the very xenophobic nationalism that once provided fertile soil for the Holocaust.
在评估报告中，我们预测如果任由目前趋势持续下去，到2050年每年可能有1，000万人死亡，从2015年算起给全球经济产出共造成约100万亿美元的损失。	In the Review, we predicted that if current trends continue, ten million people could die every year by 2050, at a loss of some $100 trillion in global economic output since 2015.
诺贝尔经济学奖罗伯特·索洛（Robert Solow）指出，增长有三个来源：工作人口、资本投资和技术进步。	The Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow has shown that growth comes from three sources: the working population, capital investment, and technological progress.
这可以在同卵双胞胎身上得到很好的说明，随着年纪的增长，他们各自DNA由环境造成的印记差异也会越来越大。	This is nicely illustrated in identical twins, who show as they age increasing differences in the way that their identical DNA is marked by the environment.
对外国直接投资和其他非债务资本流动开放可能能够促进经济增长，同时又不会���宏观经济的波动产生负面影响或者带来经济危机。	Opening up to foreign direct investment and other non-debt capital flows may serve to boost economic growth without adverse side effects on macroeconomic volatility or a risk of crisis.
虽然特朗普可能会寻求签订互利性双边协议，但人们也会预料这些协议将服从于国内优先事项，尤其是一些分配性目的，也只有在与这些优先事项一致的情况下才会予以支持。	While Trump might pursue mutually beneficial bilateral agreements, one can expect that they will be subordinated to domestic priorities, especially distributional aims, and supported only insofar as they are consistent with these priorities.
波兰的民粹主义政府也是如此，其实际领导人雅罗斯瓦夫·卡辛斯基（Jarosław Kaczyński）甚至没有在政府中担任任何正式职位。	The same goes for Poland’s populist government, whose de facto leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, doesn’t even hold a formal position in the administration.
埃及总统穆巴拉克宣称，什叶派“总是忠于伊朗 ” ， 而约旦国王阿卜杜拉则创造了正在崛起得“什叶派新月”的名词。	"President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt claims that Shiites are “always loyal to Iran,"" while King Abdullah of Jordan has coined the axiom about a rising “Shiite crescent.”"
在为自己和蔡英文通话辩解的同一条tweet中，他又重申了一次子虚乌有的指控 — — 中国让人民币贬值来获得对美国的出口优势。	In the same tweet justifying his phone call with Tsai, he repeated a false charge that China is devaluing its currency to gain export advantages vis-à-vis the US.
声称自己患有诸如“性成瘾”之类的疾病，或者就像媒体报道韦恩斯坦所做的那样进入某家康复诊所“接受治疗 ” ， 我认为他的所作所为与经典的马基雅维里反应完全相符。	Claiming to be suffering from a disorder such as “sexual addiction,” or checking into a rehabilitation clinic for “treatment,” as Weinstein has reportedly done, fits with a classic Machiavellian response.
一周后，美国和北约阿富汗司令官小邓福德将军（Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr . ） 确实为无人机袭击杀死了阿富汗赫尔曼德省（Helmand Province）一名儿童、重伤两名妇女而道歉。	A week later, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., the US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, did apologize for a drone attack that killed a child and seriously wounded two women in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province.
发自纽黑文 — — 当年亚当·斯密提出了关于“看不见的手”的著名理论，认为每个个体在自由竞争市场中对个人利益的追求会推动社会整体福利的增加。	NEW HAVEN – Adam Smith famously wrote of the “invisible hand,” by which individuals’ pursuit of self-interest in free, competitive markets advances the interest of society as a whole.
在1968年的著作《亚洲的戏剧：国穷论 》 （ Asian Drama: An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations）中，瑞典经济学家、诺贝尔奖得主贡纳尔·缪尔达尔（Gunnar Myrdal）认为“亚洲”和“穷”是同义词。	In his 1968 work Asian Drama: An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations, Swedish economist and Nobel laureate Gunnar Myrdal considered the words “Asian” and “poor” to be synonymous.
当然，其中之一是中国经济增长速度的放缓 — — 这个国家比当今世界其他任何主要经济体都更容易受到严重金融危机的冲击。	One, of course, is a potential sharp growth slowdown in China, which more than any other major economy in the world today seems vulnerable to a significant financial crisis.
就像《冰雪奇缘》中的安娜公主一样，市场需要时间才能认识到与联储的关系变化（而且这种变化是应该的 ） ； 而且，就像电影中一样，将这种新认识运用于实际交往可能要经历某些震动。	Like Princess Anna in Frozen, it will take time for markets to recognize that their relationship with the Fed is changing (and should change); and, similar to the movie, some sort of shock may be involved in socializing the new understanding.
"像现行的草案那样，因为某些""社会权利""被写入了欧洲大陆一些国家的宪法就要将其推行到整个欧盟的做法是不合适的。"	"The fact that certain ""social rights"" have made their way into some national constitutions on the Continent is no reason to impose them, as the present draft does, on the entire Union."
克鲁格曼认为“债券纠察队”一词也许只对希腊等少数国家适用，但“信心仙子”纯属想象，和收集儿童的牙仙差不多。	Krugman thought the “bond vigilante” claim might be valid for a few countries, such as Greece, but argued that the “confidence fairy” was no less imaginary than the one that collects children’s teeth.
事实上，芝加哥学派和麻省理工学派都没有提到市场结果的公平性，因为真实的市场结果取决于资源的初次分配。	Indeed, neither the Chicago School nor the MIT School say that market outcomes are fair, because actual market outcomes depend on the initial distribution of resources.
欧洲和美国的政策制定者们都被敦促按照这种常规思维行事：要把首席执行官、董事会和经理人与金融市场越来越短的投资周期隔绝开来。	Policymakers in Europe and the US are urged to act on this conventional thinking: Something must be done to insulate CEOs, boards, and managers from the financial markets’ ever-shortening time horizons.
目前我们拥有紧随印度之后的全球第二大商业流程外包行业，在2010年创造了89亿美元利润并预计2011年能达到110亿美元。	Our Business Process Outsourcing industry is now the second largest in the world, behind India, with revenues of $8.9 billion in 2010 rising to a projected $11 billion in 2011.
今天的超级明星公司的超凡地位来自数字技术的网络效应，即，随着更多的人使用某种产品，它会变得更加令人渴望。	Today’s superstar companies owe their privileged position to digital technology’s network effects, whereby a product becomes even more desirable as more people use it.
毕竟正是国内外的北非年轻人对自由的渴望将埃及和突尼斯的独裁者赶了下台，而他们的才干和活力也应当被培养和引导去帮助重建本国社会。	After all, it was the youth of North Africa, both at home and abroad, whose notions of freedom helped bring down dictators in Egypt and Tunisia. Their talents and energy should now be cultivated and harnessed to help rebuild their societies.
当特别提款权供应不足的时候，IMF要适当地增发，就如同2008年下半年，美联储为了增加市场流动性而增发美元那样。	The IMF would have to be able to issue additional SDRs in periods of shortage, as when the Fed provided dollar swaps to ensure adequate dollar liquidity in the second half of 2008.
20世纪60年代和70年代初，由于在对抗威胁到君主制度的激进运动方面存在共同利益，双方安全和政治合作有所加深。	In the 1960s and early 1970s, their security and political cooperation deepened, owing to a shared interest in confronting radical movements that threatened their monarchies.
我认为，梅耶要其员工回到办公室的原因绝不仅仅是某些员工在家并不工作，而是许多工作的员工没有在一起工作。	Mayer, I think, did not order her employees back to the office merely because some people were not actually working at home; rather, many of those who were working were not working together.
历史上第一次 ， “ 独角兽 ” （ 估值达到10亿美元以上的初创企业）不再是美国的专属品 — — 几年前这仍然是不可思议的事情。	For the first time, “unicorns” (startups that reach a valuation of more than $1 billion) are no longer the exclusive preserve of the United States – a reality that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.
既然他已经接受了400,000美元，那么应该用它来降低不平等性和推进更加进步的日程，让他的继任者拿不到这样优厚的条件。	Now that he has accepted the $400,000, he should use it to fight inequality and to promote a more progressive agenda, so that his successors do not even receive such offers.
它们的通过表明人们普遍接受所有国家共担责任维护地球自然周期的长期稳定，只有这样地球才能继续支持人类繁衍生息。	Their adoption indicates widespread acceptance of the fact that all countries share responsibility for the long-term stability of Earth’s natural cycles, on which the planet’s ability to support us depends.
答案似乎也是肯定的，这意味着我们还面临另一种长期停滞 — — 称之为“长期停滞二 ” （ SS2 ） — —其标志是我们不愿或无力实施正确的政策组合。	Here, the answer also seems to be yes, suggesting that we are also facing another type of secular stagnation – call it “secular stagnation two” (SS2) – that is dictated by our unwillingness or inability to implement the right policy mix.
简言之，新兴经济体可以从美国增长加速中获得中期好处正在被“资本海啸 ” （ 巴西总统罗塞夫语）所造成短期风险压过。	In short, the medium-term benefits that emerging economies could receive from faster growth in the US are now being swamped by short-term risks generated by the “capital tsunami,” as Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has called it.
但即便是供应链的其中一个小环节受损，所造成的影响都可能极为严重 — — 分布在亚太地区的产业链尤甚。	But the impact of even a small number of disruptions to supply chains can be highly significant, particularly for the Asia-Pacific region.
非洲所需的食品、饮料和类似加工产品约1/3仍依靠进口，而东南亚国家协会的进口比重仅为约20 % ， 南美南方共同市场集团进口比重仅为约10 % 。	Africa still imports about one-third of the food, beverages, and similar processed goods it consumes, whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations imports about 20%, and South America’s Mercosur trade bloc imports just 10%.
发自新德里 — — 巴基斯坦领导层所面对的问题和困境 — — 包括不断加深的互不信任漩涡，派系仇杀以及厚颜无耻的恐怖主义 — — 简直不可尽数。	NEW DELHI – The problems and dilemmas confronting Pakistan’s leadership – including a deepening vortex of mutual suspicions, sectarian killings, and brazen terrorism – are almost too numerous to count.
肯尼迪的许多顾问和美国军方领导人敦促他采取空袭和入侵，现在我们知道，这有可能导致苏联指挥官动用战术核武器。	Many of Kennedy’s advisers, as well as US military leaders, urged an air strike and invasion, which we now know might have led Soviet field commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons.
其中的关键原因是城市扩张：因为建筑面积比巴塞罗那大近12倍，亚特兰大暗中鼓励私人轿车的广泛使用，从而加剧了排放、交通拥堵和空气污染等问题。	A key reason for this is urban sprawl: with a built-up area nearly 12 times larger than Barcelona, Atlanta implicitly encourages widespread private-vehicle use, boosting emissions, congestion, and air pollution.
据皮尤宗教和公共生活论坛（Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life）的数据，巴西是全世界天主教徒人口最多的国家。	According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, Brazil has the largest Catholic population in the world.
年轻人长期找不到体面的工作 — — 一些国家年轻人失业率正在达到或超过50 % ， 且自2008年以来便一直处于难以接受的高水平 — — 对社会产生了离心感。	Young people who are long deprived of a decent job – and youth unemployment in some countries is approaching or exceeding 50%, and has been unacceptably high since 2008 – become alienated.
这一运动迫使保守派的尼克松政府颁布了第一批环保法律，包括1969年的国家环境法案，1970年的清洁空气法案，1972年的清洁水法案以及1973年的濒危物种法案。	This movement managed to force the first environmental laws out of the conservative Nixon administration: the National Environmental Act of 1969, the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act of 1972, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
但也不应该把欧洲排除在外，因为欧洲的人力资本健全，医疗保健也比美国更好，而且在各国市场的一体化过程中也不断涌现出更强大的企业。	It would be a mistake to count Europe out yet. Its human capital is sound, good health care is available to more people than in the US, and stronger companies are emerging through the process of integrating national markets.
虽然大多数阿拉伯政权似乎都受到了威胁，但目前为止只有两位独裁者 — — 突尼斯的本·阿里和埃及的穆巴拉克最终被推翻，事实上他们的独裁统治也都属于相对较“软性”的类型。	Yet, while most Arab regimes now appear threatened, only two authoritarian rulers – Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak in Egypt – have been actually deposed so far. Theirs were relatively “soft” autocracies.
此外，由于世界领导人及其发展伙伴再一次没能满足妇女的基本生育健康需要，在实现可持续发展日程方面取得切实进展变得更加困难了。	And, because world leaders and their development partners have failed to meet women’s basic reproductive-health needs once again, it will be more difficult to achieve concrete progress toward realizing the agenda for sustainable development.
从1991年到1993年期间，由于叶利钦尚处于婴儿阶段的民主体制还十分微弱，同时俄罗斯正痛苦挣扎于经济危机，面临政府内部不同派系之间的尖锐斗争，民族主义逐步抬头。	In the period from 1991 to 1993, nationalism was on the rise because Yeltsin’s infant democracy seemed weak, with the country in the throes of a deep economic crisis, as well as an acute confrontation between different branches of government.
尽管美国总统特朗普已经撕毁2015年巴黎气候协定，但世界其他国家对于遏制温室气体排放的决心越来越大。	Though US President Donald Trump has reneged on the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the rest of the world is becoming increasingly convinced of the need to limit greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions.
最初的问题发生在巴基斯坦西部的“联邦治理下的部落地区 ” 。 穆沙拉夫想要不惜代价避免军事行动，以触发部落反叛攻击其军队。	The first problems arose in the lawless “federally administered tribal areas” (FATA) in western Pakistan.
实证效果最好的长期疼痛治疗方法包括生活方式的改变，如锻炼、减压和减肥 — — 所有这些都需要大量的时间和努力。	The long-term pain treatment with the strongest empirical support involves lifestyle modifications such as exercise, stress reduction, and weight loss – all of which require significant time and effort.
尽管全球化及其基础 — — 贸易开放能够让整个全球经济更加富裕，但到目前为止，最富裕阶层攫取了这一收益的绝大部分。	While globalization, and the trade openness that underpins it, has the potential to enrich the entire global economy, so far the richest have captured a hugely disproportionate share of the gains.
与美国一样，日本也非常担心中国所建立的对立机构 — — 包括亚洲基础设施投资银行和金砖国家的新开发银行。	Like the US, Japan has many concerns about the parallel institutions – including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the BRICS countries’ New Development Bank – that China is creating.
因此，我不相信土耳其在欧盟委员会的敦促下所实施的改革会在加入欧盟后继续下去，也十分怀疑将来是否会出现倒退的局面。	So I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey implemented at the insistence of the European Commission would continue after accession. Indeed, I suspect that there will be backsliding.
北约组织从来被认为是“两根支柱（美欧 ） ， 一条横梁（共同的价值观 ） ” ，但即便是冷战时期，美国也经常指责欧洲那根“支柱”形同虚设，而美国人想要的则是更大程度上的“责任分担 ” 。	NATO is often described as a construction with two pillars and an architrave symbolizing the common values that form the basis of the alliance. But even during the Cold War, Americans often pointed out that the European pillar was lacking.
自金融危机以来，美联储采取了 一系列前所未有的措施，将利率削减至零、大规模扩张其资产负债表，还救助了陷入困境的金融机构。	Since the financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve has taken a series of unprecedented steps, cutting interest rates to zero, massively expanding its balance sheet, and bailing out troubled financial institutions.
比如，德国人后悔在波恩峰会上同意加入了共同财政扩张，因为在通胀肆虐的20世纪70年代末期，再通胀是一个错误的目标。	The Germans, for example, regretted having agreed to joint fiscal expansion at the Bonn summit, because reflation turned out to be the wrong objective in the inflation-plagued late 1970s.
联合国认识到了这个问题，但是却不愿意冒风险将森林学专家派往一个连美国及其联军只有在武装护卫的情况下才敢冒险涉足的偏远部族地区。	The UN acknowledges the problem but is (rightly) unwilling to risk sending forestry experts into a tribal region where American and allied troops venture only in armored convoys.
我们需要在广范围内达成一致，任何故意杀害平民及非战斗人员的行径都是不可接受的，任何罪犯或帮凶必须接受严惩。	Broad agreement is needed that any intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants is unacceptable, and that its perpetrators and supporters must be punished.
从iPhone到iPad再到MacBook，苹果公司的产品抓住了消费者的想象力，重新创造了市场，也为公司及其股东带来了大把利润。	Its products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks, have captured consumers’ imaginations, remade markets, and earned the company and its shareholders huge sums of money.
土耳其政府应当采取相对稳定的外交政策，允许民众在即将举行的全民公投和今后其他投票活动中自由地表达意见。	Turkey’s government should adopt a less erratic foreign policy and allow citizens to express themselves freely in the upcoming referendum and other future votes.
到2030年，生活在城市中的居民将贡献91%的全球消费增长，而中国正在同时强调城镇化和消费拉动的增长模式。	By 2030, people living in cities will drive 91% of global growth in consumption, and China is emphasizing both urbanization and a consumer-led growth model.
这样一个姿态不但能在国际上提升法国形象，也能对其国内的阿尔利亚裔公民表达一种亲善态度，使他们不致在双重身份认同的矛盾纠结中倒向伊斯兰原教旨主义。	Such a gesture would strengthen France both externally and in terms of the sentiments of its citizens of Algerian descent, whose difficulty in reconciling their dual identity has led some to turn to fundamentalist Islam.
但更难对付的挑战来自于西方国家本身。 美国和欧洲的反建制派政治力量正在通过挑战长期以来广为接受的价值观及合作形式来赢得支持。	Even more potent, however, is the challenge coming from within the West itself, where anti-establishment political forces in the US and Europe are winning support by contesting long-accepted values and forms of cooperation.
最终，亚的斯亚贝巴行动日程（Addis Ababa Action Agenda）规定，目前的专家委员会将继续根据其2004年的权限行使功能，每年增加三次会议，完全以自愿捐款的方式筹集资金。	In the end, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda provides that the current Committee of Experts will continue to function according to its 2004 mandate, with three additional meeting days per year, all funded through voluntary contributions.
在人道状况稳定下来后，决策者应该将重点放在为波多黎各提供稳定、可靠、高性价比的电力上，这些电力应该主要通过可再生资源产生，并通过可靠的小型分布式电网输送。	After the humanitarian situation is stabilized, policymakers should focus on providing Puerto Rico with stable, reliable, and cost-effective electric power, generated primarily by renewables and distributed over a smart, resilient grid.
清洁技术行业的下跌幅度很大；但对于新兴技术来说这是常有的事，这样能够淘汰较弱的选手，让该行业更加强健。	The shakeout in the clean-tech industry has been tough; but it has also been typical of emerging technologies, and, by weeding out the weaker players, it has made the sector more robust.
正如在我的新书《非理性充沛》中写的那样，市场似乎是有故事驱动的，同时也存在着伟大新时代和衰退即将逼近的故事，也有一些基本面故事关于技术和资源枯竭的，还有关于政治和令人瞠目结舌的阴谋的故事。	Markets seem to be driven by stories, as I emphasize in my book Irrational Exuberance. There are stories of great new eras and of looming depressions.
在那些以本币借债并且能够把公债货币化的国家，爆发主权债务危机的风险不大，但财政赤字的货币化最终将导致高通货膨胀。	In countries that borrow in their own currency and can monetize the public debt, a sovereign debt crisis is unlikely, but monetization of fiscal deficits can eventually lead to high inflation.
对于经济国家主义来源的这两种解释，一种是非理性的，另一种则不是。 这两者都不能真正地说明问题，但却描绘了一种相互交织的反应：恐惧越理性，它就越容易沦为政治工具。	These two scenarios of the origins of economic nationalism, one irrational and the other not, are not real alternatives, but describe responses that intertwine: the more rational the fear, the more that fear can be used as an instrument of politics.
更有可能的结果是，卡塔尔可能停止为穆斯林兄弟会和哈马斯少数成员提供庇护所，并慎重承诺控制面向地区广播的由国家出资的半岛电视台。	In a more likely scenario, Qatar may stop providing sanctuary for a few members of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and discreetly promise to rein in Al Jazeera, its state-funded television network, which broadcasts throughout the region.
在任何资源丰富、不民主的国家，政治阶层以及伴随其左右的商业利益几乎没有什么意愿加强产权和法治，提升竞争力。	In any resource-rich and undemocratic country, the political class and the business interests that surround it have little or no incentive to support stronger property rights, the rule of law, and competition.
根据剂量不同，患者的身体、空间和时间感可能会发生改变，较大的剂量可能造成幻觉和自体分解（dissolution of the self ） 。	Depending on the dose, a patient may experience altered physical, spatial, and temporal states; larger quantities may induce hallucinations and dissolution of the self.
但如果西方国家能够透过恐怖主义的表象看到真正的问题所在，敦促萨利赫开始共享权力，那么也门就不一定会成为恐怖分子的避风港。	But if it looks beyond terrorism to the root causes of the problem, and presses Saleh to begin to share power, Yemen need not become another safe haven for terrorists.
在许多例子中 — — 包括当今美国 — — 对于这样的政府，一开始的反应包括希望富人或许擅长创造就业岗位。	In many instances – including the United States today – the initial reaction to such a government includes the hope that perhaps rich people will be good at creating jobs.
奥巴马总统提出了大量方案投资于美国国家竞争力基础，但国会中的共和党拒绝了这些方案，他们说，美国的当务之急的财政危机。	President Barack Obama has offered numerous proposals to invest in the foundations of national competitiveness, but Congressional Republicans have rebuffed them, claiming that the US faces an impending fiscal crisis.
“这是颠覆性的向东方的地壳转移 ” ， Calestous Juma说。 他是一位哈佛大学的肯尼亚教授，为非洲联盟在技术政策上提供建议。	“It is a tectonic shift to the East with shattering implications,” says Calestous Juma, a Kenyan professor at Harvard University who advises the African Union on technology policy.
正如美国学者兼社会活动家侯赛因·伊比什近来所说，奥巴马任命的内阁让他有最大空间通过谈判与伊朗达成交易。	As the American scholar and activist Hussein Ibish recently argued, Obama has appointed a cabinet designed to give him maximum room to negotiate a deal with Iran.
影响巨大的政治家和市场分析人士都对日益迫切的纠正全球失衡的需要不屑一顾 ： “ 为什么要改变这样一种行之有效的方式 ？ ”	The growing need for measures to correct global imbalances was met with disbelief by influential policymakers and market analysts alike: “Why change a winning formula?”
要想持久、包容地重振阿根廷经济，马克里政府需要快速行动动员大规模外部金融支持，开辟新的国内资源，实施更深入的结构改革。	To revive the Argentine economy in a durable and inclusive manner, Macri’s government needs to act fast to mobilize sizeable external financial assistance, generate additional domestic resources, and implement deeper structural reforms.
政府逐步改革户籍制度的最新决定将进一步扩大成果，这使劳动者和民营企业主有机会自主选择在哪里生活、工作和投资。	The government’s recent decision to phase out the household registration (hukou) system will augment these gains further, as it gives workers and private business-owners alike the opportunity to choose where to live, work, and invest.
因为要求跨国公司转移技术的需要日益减弱，同时中国企业也能够在知识产权保护中获益，所以今天的美国与中国这方面应该更容易找到共同语言。	With the need to compel multinational firms to transfer technology waning, and Chinese firms standing to benefit from intellectual-property protection, the US and China can more easily find common ground.
光有导弹和坦克不能带来和平，但如果再加上对战败者积极伸出援手的文明力量，就能在伊拉克和中东其它地区���现真正的民主。	Missiles and tanks alone cannot bring democracy, but coupled with the civil power of sensitive help for the defeated, democracy can be adapted to Iraq and the rest of the Middle East.
所有这些都要求资金 — — 光是银行资本重组一项就要求数千亿欧元（不过，如果欧元区大国主权债务能更健康的话，此项资金需求会有所减少 ） 。	All of this requires financing – bank recapitalization alone could require hundreds of billions of euros (though these needs would be mitigated somewhat if the sovereign debt of large eurozone countries looked healthier).
2007年5月协定还明确了“在美外国投资者不可获得比美国投资者在美国所获得的更大的投资保护实质权利 。 ”	And the May 2007 agreement makes it clear that “foreign investors in the US will not be accorded greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than US investors in the US.”
所以，美国前总统布什的对朝外交政策，特别是在其第一届任期内的对朝外交政策，必须为当前的混乱局面承担一定的责任。	So former President Bush’s foreign policy toward North Korea, especially during his first term in office, must take a fair share of responsibility for the present mess.
唯一一个能与之相提并论的政策是美联储在1979—1980年间由时任主席保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker）主持采取的反通胀政策。	The only thing comparable to QE was the US Federal Reserve’s anti-inflation campaign of 1979-1980, orchestrated by the Fed’s then-chair, Paul Volcker.
在阅读美国前副国务卿塔尔博特（Strobe Talbott）的著作《大实验 》 （ The Great Experiment）时，我的印象是今天正在起作用的动态的某些根源很早前就种下了。	Upon rereading former US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott’s book The Great Experiment, I was left with the impression that the seeds of some of the dynamics at play today were sown some time ago.
然而拉丁美洲和加勒比的孩子每一年在学校里获得的技能比那些高收入国家甚至一些发展中国家的学生要少得多。	Yet Latin American and Caribbean children gain fewer skills in each year of school than students do in high-income countries – and even in some other developing countries.
此外，长期治疗和治愈并不是一回事。 此外也没有任何公共卫生工具（清洁饮用水除外）能比得上疫苗的预防作用。	Moreover, long-term treatment is not the same as a cure, and no public-health tool (apart from clean drinking water) has ever matched the preventive power of a vaccine.
当埃及总统安瓦尔·萨达特正准备他对耶路撒冷的历史性访问之时，一群犹太定居者在约旦河西岸人口最多的城市纳布卢斯附近建立起一个名为埃隆·莫热赫的犹太定居点。	When Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was preparing for his historic visit to Jerusalem, a group of settlers created the settlement of Elon Moreh near Nablus, the most populated West Bank city.
她所提出的的大赦法不但将原宥她的前任、面临谋杀指控的阿披实（Abhisit Vejjajiva）等反对派领袖，也将允许她的兄长他信回国。	She proposed an amnesty law that would have not only pardoned opposition leaders, including Abhisit Vejjajiva, her predecessor as prime minister (who faces murder charges), but allowed her brother to return to the country.
这解释了为何欧洲央行，以及一些欧盟政府，热衷于资本市场联盟工程，这项工程的目标是找到办法刺激整个欧洲的非银行融资渠道的增长。	That explains why the ECB, and some EU governments, are keen on the Capital Markets Union project, which aims to find ways to stimulate the growth of non-bank financing channels across the continent.
失业率已经连续第五年处于5.5％左右 — — 这是任何一个发达国家都会羡慕的数字 — — 因为几乎没剩下几个可以上班的失业人员了。	With unemployment at around 5.5% for the fifth consecutive year – a rate that almost any developed country would envy – there are few unemployed to be put to work.
而中国占美国超额公共持有债务的比例也翻了五番，截至2013年7月达到近11 % （ 1.3万亿美元 ） 。	And China’s share of America’s publicly-held debt overhang increased more than five-fold, to nearly 11% ($1.3 trillion) by July 2013.
在埃及，军方（不管是穆巴拉克还是西西（Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi）陆军元帅治下）和伊斯兰教徒都表现出想要大权尽揽。	In Egypt, both the army – whether under Mubarak or Field Marshal Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi – and the Islamists have demonstrated that they want all power for themselves.
所谓的“财政主宰 ” （ fiscal dominance）是真正的威胁，它会破坏货币政策，并让通胀变得更加难以控制。	There is a real danger that so-called “fiscal dominance” will undermine monetary policy and make it much harder to control inflation.
这一假设促使经济学家成为“干预怀疑派 ” ， 对于一切没有显而易见的监管需要的问题，都偏向于市场方案。	This assumption led economists to become “intervention skeptics” who preferred market-based solutions for any problem where the need for regulation was not obvious.
比如，一个至关重要的问题是决策者需要在最近的预算协议基础上更进一步，结束困扰美国未来财政局面的政治角力。	For example, it is vitally important that policymakers follow through on the recent budget agreement and end the political wrangling over the country’s fiscal future.
雅加达—1945年，印度尼西亚宣布脱离荷兰独立，国父苏加诺号召他的人民建设一个“强大地屹立”的国家，实现永久的统一。	JAKARTA – When Indonesia declared independence from Dutch rule in 1945, the country’s founder, Sukarno, called on his people to build a nation that would “stand in strength,” eternally united.
在一些社区，多元化的政治和民族成分走到了一起，同意建设“安全校园区 ” （ Safe School Zone ） 。	In some communities, diverse political and ethnic groups have come together and agreed to develop “Safe School Zones.”
如果科学家们能详细地描述他们做这个的出发点以及是如何着手去做的，也许他们自己就能公正地描述他们自己的工作的可信度。	Scientists themselves may be able to ascribe these levels of credibility to their own work in fairness, if they describe in detail what they set out to do, and how they did it.
在2016年9月会晤埃及总统阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·塞西之后，特朗普滔滔不绝的赞扬塞西是“真正控制埃及的 ” “ 出色的家伙 ” 。	After meeting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in September 2016, Trump gushed that Sisi was “a fantastic guy” who “took control of Egypt …really took control of it.”
事实上，从爱尔兰共和军到桑地诺民族解放阵线（Sandinistas ） ， 再到非洲国民议会（African National Congress ） ， 所有的武装解放运动都在适当的时候都 放弃了暴力。	In fact, all militant liberation movements have renounced violence in due time, from the IRA to the Sandinistas to the African National Congress.
但除了1998年时任韩国总统金大中礼貌地接受了日本的道歉外，日本的道歉根本没有在该地区其他国家引起任何的共鸣，因为日本在道歉的同时还不乏明显的越界或倒退举动。	But, save for a gracious acceptance by South Korea’s then-President Kim Dae-jung in 1998, Japan’s apologies simply have not resonated much in the region, because they have regularly been accompanied by apparent side-stepping or backsliding.
基本法体现了我们对未来的这一展望，为香港未来50年的发展奠定了基础，并赋予了我们自由与力量，使我们能够自力更生地将香港建设成为亚洲的国际都会。	The Basic Law embodies this vision, laying the foundations for our development over a 50-year period and providing the freedom and the power for us to position ourselves as Asia’s world city – and to do it on our own.
问题是这份提案是否表明会出现一场新的无底线监管竞争 — — 倘若真是如此，投资者又可能会面临什么样的后果。	The question is whether this proposal is indicative of a new regulatory race to the bottom – and, if so, what consequences investors might face.
欧洲人庆幸自己离那些正在崛起的世界强权 — — 比如印度，巴西，尤其是中国 — — 足够远，因此也免予遭受这些大国崛起过程中所伴生的种种冲突。	Europeans can congratulate themselves on being a relatively safe distance away from whatever tensions may accompany the rise of powers like India, Brazil, and, especially, China.
如果我们从现在开始投资于改善营养，就能为世界各地的女孩和妇女确保未来一百年甚至更长时间前景更加光明。	If we invest in better nutrition now, we can ensure a brighter future for girls and women everywhere – for the next hundred years and beyond.
同样，在一个欧盟也不受尊敬的地方，我们又该如何做呢？ 至少，我们要制定我们的自己的政策，以努力结束西岸，加沙和约旦东部之间的巴勒斯坦和巴勒斯坦人民的分裂为起点。	At the very least, we could set out our own policy, beginning with an effort to end the fragmentation of Palestine and Palestinians between the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.
这一方针虽好，但忽略了一个当务之急：确保实际上能够创造足够多的新岗位。 没有新岗位，培训得再好的工人还是没有工作。	This is all well and good, but one imperative is missing: ensuring that enough new jobs actually are created.
它第一次出现是在1938年12月哈佛大学经济学家阿尔文·汉森（Alvin Hansen）的美国经济学会主席讲话，以及同年出版的汉森的 著作中。	It first appeared in Harvard University economist Alvin Hansen’s presidential address to the American Economic Association, in December 1938, and in his book published the same year.
虽然安全问题必须认真考虑，但由于双方在上述和平条约的签署和全面实施之间会有足够时间对此进行协商，它们所占的分量已经日渐减轻了。	Security questions must be taken seriously, but they carry less and less weight, because a sufficiently long period can be left between the treaty’s conclusion and its full implementation to resolve them by mutual agreement.
要么批准首相特蕾莎·梅（Theresa May）已经跟欧盟谈好的脱欧协议，要么在没有达成任何协议的情况下溃退出欧盟，要么尝试完全扭转整个退出进程。	The choice is between approving the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated with the European Union, crashing out of the EU with no deal, or trying to reverse the exit process altogether.
相信文化现代性出现在不止一种物种当中的重要意义在于它在很大程度上终结了那种在探究自然世界与人类文明的关系方面的传统两分法似的西方思维。	The most important implication of believing that cultural modernity emerged in more than one species is that it largely eliminates the dichotomy that Western thought has traditionally detected between the natural world and human culture.
法兰克福—尽管欧盟在金融市场一体化方面取得了很大的进展，但在关键领域仍存在着诸多障碍：零售服务、银行并购和税制协调等等。	FRANKFURT – Despite great progress in integrating the European Union’s financial markets, barriers remain in key areas: retail services, bank mergers and acquisitions, and tax harmonization, to name but a few.
尽管奥巴马声称TPP是历史上最进步的贸易协定，但众议院筹款委员会（Ways and Means Committee）主席、民主党员桑德尔·莱文（Sander Levin ） — —他可以接触到TPP协定全文 — — 不同意这一说法。	Although Obama says that the TPP is the most progressive trade agreement in history, Sander Levin, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee – and someone will full access to the text – disagrees.
几个世纪以来，基督徒和穆斯林都把耶西迪人称为“魔鬼崇拜者 ” ， 向他们施加了无情的迫害，特别是在十八和十九世纪的奥斯曼土耳其帝国。	Over the centuries, both Christians and Muslims dubbed the Yezidi “devil worshippers,” and subjected them to relentless persecution, which was especially extreme under the Ottoman Turks in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
随着伊朗秘密核设施和反应堆的不断曝光，以及德黑兰当局不断拒绝旨在保证核设施民用而非武器化的国际监察，不信任的情绪正与日俱增.	Disbelief grows with every revelation of secret Iranian facilities and plans, and with every refusal by Iran to negotiate safeguards that would allow for civil use while preventing weaponization.
在典型的衰退期间，不履行债务的企业的比率可能升高到10-15 % ， 从而使那些持有高风险公司债券的机构面临巨额损失的危险。	During a typical recession, the default rate among corporations may rise to 10-15%, threatening massive losses for those holding risky corporate bonds.
我们如何应对紧急情况是未来增长和稳定的基础，而我们如何投资于发展可以帮助构建对抗未来紧急情况的恢复力。	How we respond in emergencies lays a foundation for future growth and stability, and how we invest in development can help build resilience against future emergencies.
它的成员会承认没有可以解决美国经济问题的神奇办法，而且他们会专注在“实际选项”上 — — 也就是那些可以用来改善现状的事物。	Its members would admit that there are no miraculous solutions to America’s economic problems, and they would focus on the “practical options” that are actually available to make things a little better.
私有化允许个人设立私人储蓄账户，而社会保障制度投资低回报率的国库券。 曾有一度，前者看起来优于后者。	There was a time when privatization – allowing individuals to set up individual savings accounts – seemed better than Social Security, which invests in lower-yielding Treasury bills.
1994年1月1日墨西哥、加拿大和美国达成北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）时，墨西哥似乎正面临着真正的腾飞。	When the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Mexico, Canada, and the United States entered into force on January 1, 1994, it seemed that Mexico was poised for a true takeoff.
因此，我在这里对2004年在这一领域通过的一揽子方案深表失望。 有几个成员国未能在既定的期限内转换这套旨在使流程简单化和现代化的方案。	I am, therefore, deeply disappointed that a package of measures adopted in this area in 2004 – aimed at simplifying and modernizing procedures – has not been transposed within the agreed deadline by several member states.
当普京的发言人德米特里•帕斯科夫令人不解地宣布，那骨灰盒放在那里是为了体现普京的重要性时，俄罗斯人哈哈大笑起来。	Russians’ laughter turned Homeric when Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, inexplicably announced that the urns had been placed there to give Putin a sense of importance.
希腊从未拥有能让它曾经如此富裕的生产结构：其收入是用大量借款推起来的，而这笔借款本来可以用于升级其生产力。	Greece never had the productive structure to be as rich as it was: its income was inflated by massive amounts of borrowed money that was not used to upgrade its productive capacity.
根据更加广义（也更加合适）的定义，即将寻找全职工作的兼职员工临时工也包括进来，那么美国的整体失业率为10.3 % 。	According to a broader (and more appropriate) definition, which includes part-time employees seeking full-time jobs and marginally employed workers, the unemployment rate for the United States as a whole is 10.3%.
但逐渐实施的税收减免总额上限（所谓的税收支出）可以和福利支出改革一起构成美国所需要的能够避免再次衰退的财政整合方案。	But a gradual phase-in of an overall cap on tax deductions and exclusions (so-called tax expenditures), combined with reform of entitlement spending, could achieve the long-run fiscal consolidation that America needs without risking a new recession.
东盟在20世纪60年代末、70年代初起航的时机也恰到好处，美国、中国和域内成员国的战略利益形成了趋同。	It helped that as ASEAN was getting off the ground in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the strategic interests of America, China, and the bloc’s members converged.
两年半前，荷兰政府联手IBM和一批中小型本地企业在德文格洛（荷兰射电天文研究所所在地）最北部的村庄里快速启动了大规模数据中心项目。	Two and a half years ago, the Dutch government teamed up with IBM and a group of small and medium-size local businesses to jumpstart a big-data hub in the far-northern village of Dwingeloo, home to the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy.
我们的目标应当是确保所有需要药物的人都能够以低廉的价格拿到它；其中包括高危人群，如医疗卫生工作者、艾滋病毒/艾滋病感染者，结核病是导致后者死亡的主要原因。	The goal should be to ensure that medicines are accessible and affordable for anyone who needs them; this includes high-risk populations such as health-care workers, as well as people living with HIV/AIDS, for whom TB is a leading cause of death.
米兰—我刚刚获得了在德国经济委员会主年会演讲的荣幸。 德国经济委员会是当前执政党基督教民主联盟的经济和商业部门。	MILAN – I have just had the privilege of speaking at the main annual conference of Germany’s Economic Council, the economic and business arm of the Christian Democratic Union, the current governing party.
因为它是西方人伪善的证明 — — 无论是在核不扩散，拒绝与民选的哈马斯政府合作，或者是在指责俄罗斯在格鲁吉亚“不当”使用武力的同时却对加沙地区冲突的 1300 条亡魂���持沉默的行为。	It exemplifies Western hypocrisy – whether over nuclear non-proliferation, the refusal to deal with the elected Hamas, or readiness to criticize Russia for “disproportionate” use of force in Georgia while remaining quiet over 1,300 deaths in Gaza.
即使降低企业税率是有道理的（尽管在减税额方面仍然存在问题 ） ， 但依然有足够的理由去反对美国近期的财政政策。	There are plenty of reasons to object to recent US fiscal policy, even if lowering the corporate-tax rate made sense (albeit not by the amount enacted).
这个“黄金时期”在1971年发生的所谓“尼克松冲击”中走向终结，美国也同时失去了维持全球资本主义稳定的从全球各地回收的顺差。	That “golden era” ended with the so-called Nixon shock in 1971, when America lost the surpluses that, recycled internationally, kept global capitalism stable.
对数据遮遮掩掩将让我们暴露于风险之中 — — 我们很可能只有在下一场危机之后才能弄清楚这场危机的原因。	Barring that, there is the risk that we will find out what caused this crisis after the next one.
我们的计算表明，如果该协议得到实施，则其他种类的债券将基本什么也得不到（假设债务重组的重点是恢复波多黎各债务的可持续性 ） 。	As our computations show, if such a deal were to be implemented, there would be virtually nothing left for the other categories of bonds (assuming that the point of the debt restructuring is to restore the sustainability of the island’s debt).
穿行在这个污秽却重兵把守的边境哨所，需要敲大量的图章和进行无处不在的贿赂，这一过程在离开该“共和国”时又周而复始。	Progress through this squalid, but well manned, frontier post involved the stamping of lots of documents and a liberal scattering of bribes, a process repeated on leaving the “republic.”
但是，通过研究一些力学现象并且发挥一些想象力，这种鱼类中的物理学家意识到，如过假定它们周遭并非真空，而是被一种介质（水 ! ） 包围着，而这种介质影响了事物的表现，那它们所了解的运动定律可以被大大简化。	But, after studying some mechanics and using their imaginations, the physicist-fish realize that they could deduce much simpler laws of motion by supposing that they are surrounded by a medium (water!) that complicates the appearance of things.
在中国，恶化的空气污染和日益增加的能源安全忧虑促使政府考虑在未来10—15年内限制煤炭使用并制定绝对减排目标。	In China, worsening air pollution and growing concerns about energy security have led the government to consider a cap on coal use and an absolute reduction in emissions within the next 10-15 years.
伊拉克的统计数字有关失业的定义更为宽泛。 它们表明，伊拉克的失业率在过去两年中从百分之二十五左右下降到百分之十左右。	Iraqi statistics, which define unemployment more expansively, show rates in percent declining from the mid-twenties to the teens in the past two years.
首先，它同意参加与中国、日本、俄罗斯、韩国和美国进行的六方会谈（我以负责东亚和太平洋事务的助理国务卿的身份代表美国 ） 。	First, it agreed to participate in the six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the US (which I represented as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs).
2003年9月，时任总裁科勒（Horst Köhler）在吉隆坡的讲话中承认临时性资本管制可能有助于世界其他地区免受高波动流入的影响。	In a September 2003 speech in Kuala Lumpur, then-Managing Director Horst Köhler conceded that temporary capital controls can provide relief against volatile inflows from the rest of the world.
2006年，诺贝尔奖获得者德国作家君特·格拉斯被揭露在60年前，当他还是一个十几岁的孩子的时候，曾是武装党卫队的成员。	In 2006, the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass’s disclosed that, 60 years earlier, he was, as a teenager, a member of the Waffen-SS.
在他看来欧元区需要设立自有的财政部长和议会，还需要获拨数千亿欧元的预算以承担投资项目以及增加在高失业率国家身上的支出。	The eurozone, he argues, needs its own finance minister and its own parliament. It needs a budget in the hundreds of billions of euros to underwrite investment projects and augment spending in countries with high unemployment.
另一个相关挑战涉及资源调配：各国需要资金投资于非洲内外的基础设施、人力资源以及贸易和数字联系的创造。	Another, related challenge concerns resource mobilization: countries need funds to invest in infrastructure, human capital, and the creation of trade and digital links within and beyond Africa.
比如，去年解放军在拉达克（Ladakh）的德普桑（Depsang）峡谷临时扎营，导致了与印度的紧张对峙。	For example, last year, Chinese troops established a temporary camp in Ladakh’s Depsang valley, leading to a high-stakes standoff with India.
他们赢得胜利是因为人民对腐败的政治建制派日益愤怒，他们在金融动荡和年轻人高失业等重大经济问题上都没有交出满意的答卷。	They won because of mounting anger toward a corrupt political establishment that has failed to address major economic problems, from financial instability to high youth unemployment.
发自纽约 — — 倘若有人跟你提到某小国不但向其公民提供直通大学的免费教育，学童接送服务，还有免费医疗 — — 包括心脏手术在内。	NEW YORK – Suppose someone were to describe a small country that provided free education through university for all of its citizens, transportation for school children, and free health care – including heart surgery – for all.
类似于传统的军事命令和控制（command-and-control）协议，它们以量取胜，可以快速响应各种攻击。	Similar to traditional military command-and-control protocols, they gain power in numbers and can quickly react to a broad array of attacks.
美国国防部长阿什顿·卡特（Ashton Carter）回答说 ， “ 这并没有什么错误：美国将进行国际法允许的飞行、航海和其他行动，我们在全世界都是这么做的 。 ”	US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter replied that, “[T]here should be no mistake about this: the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows us, as we do all around the world.”
这正是在ICO诈骗犯真正想把我们带去的地方 — — 不是电影里充满未来感的《摩登家庭 》 （ The Jetsons ） ， 而是《摩登原始人 》 （ The Flintstones）里所有交易都借助不同代币或商品的交换来进行的现代石器时代。	That is precisely where the ICO charlatans would effectively take us – not to the futuristic world of “The Jetsons,” but to the modern Stone Age world of “The Flintstones” where all transactions occur through the barter of different tokens or goods.
即便是这种由对冲通胀导致的金价上涨也不乏泡沫成分，到了2008年下半年，当高达145美元的油价开始扼杀全球增长势头之时，世界经济滑入衰退。	Even that rise was partly a bubble, which collapsed in the second half of 2008, when – after oil reached $145, killing global growth –the world economy fell into recession.
10月初，美国国防部长哈格与韩国国防部长达成了“定制威慑 ” （ Tailored Deterrence）协议，但不出几日，这一协议便无法维持下去，因为美国承诺日本助其大规模升级军力。	US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel’s agreement in early October with his South Korean counterpart on a Tailored Deterrence strategy became untenable a few days later, when the US promised Japan a massive upgrading of its military capabilities.
太阳能怀疑者一直认为因为与替代方案相比成本过高，如果没有大规模补贴，其在发电领域的份额上升不会超过几个百分点。	Skeptics of solar power have long argued that its share in electricity generation cannot rise above a few percentage points without massive subsidies, because it is too costly compared to the alternatives.
金大中亲眼目睹冷战在欧洲和平结束，他希望自己的祖国与共产主义朝鲜之间的冲突也能以类似的非暴力形式收尾。	Kim had watched the Cold War come to a peaceful end in Europe, and he wanted to bring his own country’s ongoing confrontation with the communist North to a similarly nonviolent conclusion.
和一些其他国家的公民一样，哥斯达黎加人证明了不平等性是一种选择，公共政策能够确保比光靠市场提供的更大程度的经济平等和机会成本。	Like citizens of a few other countries, Costa Ricans have made clear that inequality is a choice, and that public policies can ensure a greater degree of economic equality and equality of opportunity than the market alone would provide.
现在的考验就是苏丹达尔福尔地区的局势。 在那里，外交官们正试图建立一支由联合国和非洲联盟共同领导下的维和部队。	The current test case is the situation in Sudan’s Darfur region, where diplomats are trying to establish a joint peacekeeping force under the UN and the African Union.
在1950年，拥有电视机的美国家庭比例不到8 % ； 到了1960年，90%的美国家庭都拥有了一台电视机。	In 1950, fewer than 8% of American households owned a TV; by 1960, 90% had one.
在繁荣的亚洲互联网市场上，数字技术可能是一柄双刃剑：如果性别差距不缩小，妇女将被横扫整个地区的技术推动的革命抛在身后。	In Asia’s booming Internet market, digital technologies could be a double-edged sword: If the gender gap is not closed, women will be left on the sidelines of the technology-driven revolution sweeping the region.
负责实施检查的海关官员难免会成为分离的象征，甚至成为一种挑衅，引起共和派极端分子的暴力行为，过去就曾发生过这样的事情。	The customs officers tasked with implementing those checks will inevitably become symbols of division, and potentially even a provocation to violence by republican extremists, as happened in the past.
无数的穆斯林学者都从几个世纪以来的宗教法律中引经据典，高声质问恐怖分子对其自杀式炸弹和对平民的攻击的辩护。	Numerous Muslim scholars have raised their voices to challenge the terrorists’ defense of suicide bombings or attacks on civilians, offering long citations from centuries of religious jurisprudence.
德国总理默克尔决定洞开国门迎接难民，这是一个鼓舞人心的姿态，但考虑欠妥，因为这样做没有考虑到拉动因素。	German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to open her country’s doors wide to refugees was an inspiring gesture, but it was not properly thought out, because it ignored the pull factor.
在此过程中，官员开始承认良好治理的重要性，最近将薄熙来撤职并进入调查程序便是中共“捍卫法治精神”的明证。	In the process, officials are acknowledging the importance of good governance, as demonstrated by recent efforts to justify the purge and investigation of Bo Xilai as an example of the Communist Party “safeguarding the rule of law.”
鲁哈尼的经济战略显然在伊朗年轻人中间是失败的，他们占了失业人口的60 % ， 并且大多在2013年的选举中支持鲁哈尼。	Rouhani’s economic strategy has clearly failed younger Iranians, who account for 60% of the unemployed, and who generally favored him in the 2013 election.
但圣约翰的多姆（Dome）天然气田中大部分是二氧化碳李奇微亚利桑那石油公司（Ridgeway Arizona Oil Corporation）意在利用这些二氧化碳增强该地区的石油回收工程。	But the St. John’s Dome natural-gas field is dominated by CO2, which the Ridgeway Arizona Oil Corporation aims to use to enhance oil-recovery projects in the area.
但是，请记住修西底德（Thucydides）的忠告，它对避免错误解读分析家的现实理论十分重要，并且还将继续向政治领导人和公众指出这一点。	But, remembering Thucydides’ advice, it will be important not to mistake analysts’ theories for reality, and to continue pointing this out to political leaders and publics.
高达23.7%的西班牙人 — — 包括50%的年轻人 — — 都处于失业状态，而更多的人干脆直接就退出了劳动力市场。	A whopping 23.7% of Spaniards – and one in two young people – are unemployed, while many more have dropped out of the labor force altogether.
但因为和平特别管辖条款涉及的某些高级军界、商界和政界人物涉嫌与右翼准军事组织有染，这些人现在已经被哥伦比亚参议院免职。	Colombia’s Senate, however, has now removed from the JEP’s jurisdiction high-ranking military, business, and political figures suspected of colluding with the right-wing paramilitaries.
可惜，由于美国总统奥巴马在处理叙利亚危机方面的举措失当，以色列总理内塔尼亚胡已经认定除此之外别无选择。	Alas, given US President Barack Obama’s lamentable handling of the crisis in Syria, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu may conclude that he has no option but to go it alone.
尽管他曾宣誓要在今年将支出削减1,000亿英镑以上，但实际只削减了不到一半，只是将他的五年期削减计划又延长了几年。	Though he vowed to reduce spending by more than £100 billion by now, he has cut less than half of that, simply extending his five-year rolling program of cuts for another few years.
刚刚破灭的由所谓的特别投资工具、衍生品、债务抵押债券以及虚假的3A评级助长的信贷泡沫，是建立在数学模型的幻想之上的。	The just-collapsed credit bubble, fueled by so-called special investment vehicles, derivatives, collateralized debt obligations, and phony triple-A ratings, was built on the illusions of mathematical modeling.
至于英格兰银行，行长卡尼（Mark Carney）强调近期升息的必要性，因为英国通胀已经大大高于 目标。	For the Bank of England (BoE), Governor Mark Carney has emphasized the need to raise rates in the near future, given that UK inflation is well above target.
但事实上国家可以借助毁灭性力量、或者是战争和叛乱来阻止严重罪行的发生，在这样的极端事例面前，这条理由实际也很难成立。	But this argument is undermined by the fact that the state can resort to lethal force to prevent serious crimes, or to fight a war or rebellion.
特别是，对于维持市场份额至关重要的银行来说，你无法期待它们约束高风险贷款，特别是在情况转坏有纳税人援助兜底的情况下。	In particular, banks, for which maintaining market share is crucial, cannot be expected to constrain risky lending, especially given the expectation that, if things do go wrong, the taxpayers will fund a bailout.
惯性有利于已经获得国际使用的货币，而中国缺少有深度和流动性的资本市场，而这时任何国际储备货币都必须满足的重要先决条件。	Inertia favors currencies that are already in use internationally, and China lacks deep and liquid financial markets, an important precondition that any international reserve currency must meet.
但在政治上，欧洲经济区成员资格将是一项不公正的待遇，因为英国将必须在诸如消费者保护，环境和社会政策领域遵守单一市场规则和立法 — — 而在制定这些法律法规的过程中不享有任何发言权。	Politically, though, EEA membership would be a raw deal. Britain would have to comply with single-market rules and legislation in areas such as consumer protection, the environment, and social policy – rules that it would have no say in creating.
在2008年发表的一篇接受苏格兰长老会杂志《生活与工作》的采访中，她支持那些忍受难以忍受痛苦的人结束自己生命的权利。	In an interview published in 2008 in the Church of Scotland’s magazine Life and Work, she supported the right of those suffering intolerably to end their lives.
只要制裁被解除，伊朗承诺可以几乎立刻将石油出口量提高一倍，达到每天两百万桶，到2020年还可以将出口量再翻一番。	Once sanctions are lifted, Iran promises to double oil exports almost immediately to two million barrels daily, and then to double exports again by the end of the decade.
这个问题开辟了一个崭新且更为明目张胆的感实性领域，而唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）这类人对此十分热衷，并且似乎每天都在推出新鲜发明的“事实 ” 。	This question has opened the door for a new, more overt truthiness, espoused by the likes of Trump, who seems to introduce freshly invented “facts” on a daily basis.
皮克可能是民族主义者，但他们的观点在一战前的欧洲客厅中也是不可或缺的话题（纳粹和西班牙长枪党则并非如此 ） 。	The PEKOs may be nationalists, but their opinions would not have been out of place in the drawing rooms of Europe before World War I (the same cannot be said of the Nazis or the Spanish Falange).
20世纪80年代后期，日本政治圈流行着一种说法：即美国治下的和平已经结束，取而代之的是亚洲地区的日本和平。	In the late 1980's, it was fashionable in some Japanese policy circles to argue that the Pax Americana was over, to be replaced in Asia by Pax Japonica.
因此伊朗市民 — — 以及所有渴望反抗一个残暴政府或者抗议一个民主政权的 — — 都要牢记这些历史经验。	Iran’s citizens – and all people longing to resist a tyrannical government or to protest in an established democracy – should bear that lesson in mind.
那个时代的经济学领袖人物米尔顿·弗里德曼声称，刻意追求充分的就业一定会助长通货膨胀；政府应该专注于保护货币“安全 ” ， 让经济按照其自己的方式运行。	The economic guru of that era, Milton Friedman, claimed that the deliberate pursuit of full employment was bound to fuel inflation. Governments should concentrate on keeping money “sound” and leave the economy to look after itself.
平心而论，尽管马克思的著作很少具有仔细搜集的经济数据作为支撑，并且许多内容堪称海外奇谈，但皮克提著作的大部分内容建立在仔细搜集的经济数据的基础上，很少有海外奇谈。	To be fair, whereas very little of what Marx wrote was based on carefully collected economic statistics, and much of it was bizarre, much of what Piketty writes is based on carefully collected economic statistics, and very little of it is bizarre.
世界上大部分发达经济体面临着极低的通胀，甚至有可能发生物价水平全面下跌的情况，在这样的通缩背景下，债务的真实负担其实在节节攀升。	With much of the world facing very low inflation, and even the possibility of outright decline in the price level, the real burden of debt has been increasing.
尽管缓和关系代表了伊朗的民意，美伊两国也有共同的战略利益，但美国和伊朗真正坐下来改变现状，恐怕还得要几年的时间。	Still, despite popular demand in Iran, and common strategic interests, it could be years before America and Iran sit down and make amends.
但长时间以来，在澳大利亚都存在一种怀疑，质疑针对无论在任何地方，任何时间，任何人在任何情景下都无法容忍发表种族主义攻击行为的根本信息究竟有多少真正的全面承诺。	For a long time, however, there has been doubt in Australia about how much real across-the-board commitment there was to the underlying message that racial vilification anywhere, anytime, by anyone, in any context, is simply unacceptable.
基利奇达罗格乌领导的政党共和人民党（Republican People’s Party，CHP）受到非常多的因埃尔多安的大多数统治（majority rule）而深感失望的人的支持。	The party that Kiliçdaroğlu leads, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), commands a high level of support from Turks frustrated by Erdoğan’s majority rule.
在全球和平与繁荣在某种程度上取决于西方-俄罗斯关系是否稳定的情况下，为何要吝啬这些小小的减少偏执让步呢？	With global peace and prosperity partly hinging on a stable Western-Russian relationship, is it too much to ask for such small, paranoia-reducing steps?
去年7月，联合国大会一致通过了一项由不丹提出的决议，承认人类根本目标在于追求幸福，而国内生产总值不能体现这一目标。	Last July, the UN General Assembly passed, without dissent, a Bhutanese-initiated resolution recognizing the pursuit of happiness as a fundamental human goal and noting that this goal is not reflected in GDP.
最后，政府服务数字化 — — 如面向穷人的食品分配计划 — — 有助于印度根除漏出和转移，根据我们的统计，有一半的食品因为漏出和转移问题无法达到计划接收者手中。	Finally, by digitizing government services, such as food-distribution programs for the poor, India could eliminate the leakage that diverts, according to our estimates, half of the food from intended recipients.
这也能够解释他们为什么在反对伊朗核野心的问题上试图获得政治支持，伊朗的核野心每隔一段时间就会威胁到以色列，而且不时宣称要将这个国家从地球上彻底抹去。	That is why they have tried to obtain political support against the nuclear ambitions of Iran, which periodically threatens Israel, at times proclaiming its desire to wipe it off the face of the earth.
随着世界的复杂性 — — 以及对专业知识的依赖 — — 日益增加，这个“佩蒂问题”可能会变得更严重，也无助于为专家博得普通百姓的好感。	This “Petty problem” is likely to become worse, as the world’s complexity – and, thus, its reliance on expertise – increases. This will do nothing to endear experts to ordinary people.
作为回应，欧盟可能让欧洲人权法院调查匈牙利违反欧盟规则的行为，或者指派欧盟一级的检察官对匈牙利滥用欧盟基金的行为提起民事或刑事诉讼。	In response, the EU could have the European Court of Human Rights investigate Hungary’s violations of EU rules, or an EU-level prosecutor could bring civil or criminal actions against Hungary’s misuse of EU funds.
其逻辑结论将是美国崛起为世界第一大石油生产国，而沙特阿拉伯将变得无关紧要 — — 不仅作为石油出口国是如此，作为美国必须捍卫的国家恐怕也是如此。	Its logical conclusion would have been America’s emergence as the world’s top oil producer, while Saudi Arabia faded into insignificance, not only as an oil exporter but also perhaps as a country that the US felt obliged to defend.
旧金山—美联储维持“物价稳定”的使命（由联邦储备法明文规定）和美联储自己选择的2%通胀目标之间有一个极大的不同点。	SAN FRANCISCO – There is a big difference between the Federal Reserve’s mandate to maintain “stable prices” – as enunciated in the Federal Reserve Act – and the Fed’s self-selected target of 2% annual inflation.
几十年来，苏丹民众一直遭受着激烈冲突的蹂躏，冲突的根源是毫无希望的贫困、对资源的争夺、以及种族和宗教紧张局势。	Sudan has been ravaged for decades by bitter conflicts rooted in abject poverty, struggles over resources, and ethnic and religious tensions.
当全球经济涵盖了少数几个规模相近，比上文中的小经济体要大却又不足以单独控制整个体系的经济体时，事情就变得更复杂了。	Things become more complicated when the global economy includes a small number of economies of similar size, larger than the small economies from the previous example, but not large enough to dominate the system alone.
与此同时日本经济继续徘徊不前，于是日本央行如今开始“管理收益率曲线”以图再次将通胀和增长指数拖离当前的低水平。	Meanwhile, the Japanese economy continues to limp along, with the Bank of Japan now “managing the yield curve” in yet another attempt to raise inflation and growth from their current low levels.
而尽管伊朗政府面临着合法性危机及其特有的管理不善问题，但绿色革命运动（表面上是由反对派总统候选人米尔·侯赛因·穆萨维和迈赫迪·卡鲁比所领导的）也面临着一连串重大障碍。	Despite the government’s crisis of legitimacy and endemic mismanagement, the Green Movement – nominally led by opposition presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi – faces major obstacles.
世界人权宣言规定的社会保障权要求建立全面的社会保障，以此来确保包括贫困及有贫困风险者在内的所有人的福祉。	The right to social security enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights requires universal social protection to ensure the well-being of all, including people living in poverty and those at risk of poverty.
这两个位于欧洲心脏地区的国家本已因欧盟成员国身份而获得了方方面面的巨大好处；也绝不应丢掉取得进一步发展的机遇。	Both countries, at the heart of Europe, have profited enormously in every sense from EU membership; they must not throw away their opportunity to make further progress.
“我们已经有了一套为企业界带来了很多好处的税收改革方案 ， ” 罗伯茨告诉《堪萨斯城星报》说 ， “ 而这一个的政策举措则与之背道而驰 。 ”	“We have a tax reform package that’s bringing a lot of benefits to the business community,” Roberts told the Kansas City Star, “and this is a policy move that is contrary to that.”
西西和阿卜杜拉在访问特朗普的时候都重申了2002年阿拉伯和平倡议（Arab Peace Initiative）中的立场：以色列应该完全撤出占领的领土，换取与阿拉伯联盟国家的关系正常化。	When Sisi and Abdullah visited Trump, each reiterated the position included in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative: Israel should withdraw fully from the occupied territories, in exchange for normalization of relations with Arab League countries.
想一想今年早些时候共和党取消和取代平价医疗法 （ “ 奥巴马医保 ” ） 的努力 — — 现在看来，这些努力和街头卖艺差不多。	Consider the Republicans’ efforts earlier this year to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) – an effort that, it now seems clear, was pure Dingbat Kabuki.
而且，减排还能带来巨大的附带利益：减少温室气体的排放可以降低空气污染，提高能源保障、农业产量和就业。	Moreover, there are enormous co-benefits to mitigation: lower emissions of GHGs would be accompanied by lower air pollution and increased energy security, agricultural output, and employment.
最近，非商业投机客以前所未有的大手笔在纽约和伦敦期货市场买入石油合约，这表明制裁可能已经体现在定价中，布伦特原油价格已经达到每桶78美元。	Unprecedented recent purchases of oil contracts by non-commercial speculators in the New York and London futures markets suggest that sanctions may already be priced in, with Brent oil trading at $78 a barrel.
但如果当前的商业和消费者文化持续下去，我们很快就会有更多与中国的英才和社会主义派传统，而不是我们自身的个人主义和自由民主传统相近的东西。	But if current trends in business and consumer culture continue, we might soon have more in common with Chinese meritocratic and communitarian traditions than with our own history of individualism and liberal democracy.
如果允许在2028年出现相当于GDP7.1％的赤字规模并一路延续下去，那么债务相对GDP的比率将达到150％以上，从而使美国的负债比率与意大利、希腊和葡萄牙相当。	If a deficit amounting to 7.1% of GDP were allowed to occur in 2028, and to continue thereafter, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach more than 150%, putting the US debt burden in the same league as that of Italy, Greece, and Portugal.
由于中国经济在2008~2009年经济危机后迅速复原并回复到10%的年增长率，有些中国官员和政策评论员都敦促政府采取某种更为自信的外交政策以展现自身的新势力。	After the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as China recovered rapidly and resumed 10% annual economic growth, some Chinese officials and commentators urged a more assertive foreign policy to reflect China’s new strength.
如果说有什么证据证明印度有必要实行总统制，那就是政府首脑每隔几个月就必须放弃职务责任为所在党派站脚助威的奇观。	If there ever were need for yet another clinching argument for a presidential system in India, it is the spectacle of the head of government abandoning the responsibilities of that office every few months to go on the stump for their party.
所有人都同意，现行制度有着致命的缺陷：从全球标准看，美国公司税率太高，而由于各种扭曲经济决策的税收减免和特殊优惠，公司税基又太窄。	The current system, all agree, is deeply flawed: the corporate tax rate is too high by global standards, and the corporate tax base is too narrow, owing to numerous credits, deductions, and special provisions that distort economic decisions.
今天的失败与其说是因为经济困难，不如说是因为集体无能：无法创造丘吉尔所说的通过共同的“爱国主义和共同公民权”联系在一起的“欧洲大家庭 ” 。	Today’s failures have less to do with economic hardship than with the collective inability to create what Winston Churchill once called “the European family” linked by shared “patriotism and common citizenship.”
最新民调显示，她的主要反对者、骄傲地自称为社会主义者的伯尔尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）与她的差距越来越小 — — 在一些州甚至已经领先于她。	In recent opinion polls, her main opponent, Bernie Sanders, who proudly calls himself a socialist, is edging ever closer to Clinton – and is actually leading her in some states.
而且，迄今为止，欧洲几乎所有军事行动都是为了保障欧洲国民的安全撤离，此外还包括提供人道主义援助或在冲突爆发后进行维和。	And, so far, virtually all European military operations have been aimed at evacuating European nationals, delivering humanitarian aid, or maintaining peace in the aftermath of conflict.
7月9日，土耳其反对派主要领导人凯末尔·基利奇达罗格乌（Kemal Kiliçdaroğlu）从首都安卡拉出发步行25天后，敦促支持者起来反对民主自由的颓败。	On July 9, after walking for 25 days from the capital, Ankara, Turkey’s main opposition leader, Kemal Kiliçdaroğlu, urged supporters to resist the decline in democratic freedoms.
而穷困农民所获得的补偿也确实不多；在卖掉它们的主要收入来源后，拜开发所赐，他们要面临本地生活成本激增的局面。	And the compensation that poor farmers did receive did not go very far; having sold their primary means of earning income, they then faced a steep rise in the local cost of living, owing to development.
长久以来，我们一直对被告做出无罪推定，除非掌握了确凿的证据来推翻它。 只有破坏了这种文化，布什政府才能让法律对折磨的定义变得如此琐碎。	Only such a culture - one that undermined the longstanding presumption that an accused person is innocent until proven guilty - could produce the Bush administration's niggling legal distinctions concerning what is and what is not torture.
在第二次世界大战期间，英国充分利用了这一点，因此虽然英镑已不复昔日荣光，但阿根廷、埃及、特别是印度仍成为了主要的英镑债权国。	During World War II, Britain took advantage of this, and Argentina, Egypt, and India, in particular, built up huge claims on sterling, although it was an unattractive currency.
不幸的是，关于即将到来的“债务纾困”和“干净退出”希腊的第三次“援助”的好话掩盖了一个难堪的事实：希腊的债务奴役状态将延续到2060年。	Unfortunately, all the happy talk about impending “debt relief” and a “clean exit” from Greece’s third “bailout” obscures an uglier truth: the country’s debt bondage is being extended to 2060.
社会保障政策对小型专业经济体来说倍加重要，因为整个经济体往往会因某个贸易部门遭遇外部冲击而陷入困境。	Social-security policies are doubly important for small, specialized economies, because an external shock to one tradable sector can affect the entire economy.
总而言之，如果政府无法直接面对经济结构的问题，那么中国政府的危机管理手段对国家长期发展所造成的负面影响将十分严重。	All in all, the negative impact of the Chinese government’s crisis-management measures on China’s long-term growth may be serious if the authorities fail to tackle the economy’s structural problems head on.
研究人员认为用扑热息痛替代阿斯匹林可能导致过敏免疫反应的增强，由此增加了对哮喘和其他过敏性疾病的易感性。	Substitution of paracetamol for aspirin, researchers proposed, may have led to an enhanced allergic immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to asthma and other allergic disorders.
马哈拉斯特拉邦最近的牛肉禁令 — — 这一禁令将威胁到一百万穆斯林肉贩和卡车司机的生计 — — 在此前任何邦政府中都不会实行，也不会得到此前的新德里政府的支持。	The state of Maharashtra’s recent beef ban – which threatens the livelihoods of a million Muslim butchers and truckers – would not have been imposed by any previous state government or supported by any previous administration in New Delhi.
进入二十世纪后，政府的角色，如以公共部门占GDP之比以及监管民间活动法规的深度和复杂度来衡量，几乎在每个经济体都在不断扩张。	The state’s role – measured according to the public sector’s share of GDP, for example, and the depth and complexity of laws governing private activities – has been expanding in almost every economy since the beginning of the twentieth century.
新兴市场经济体在结构上仍非常容易受到短期传染风险影响，因此，少数国家的问题演变为整个资产类别融资条件吃紧只是时间问题。	With the emerging-market economies still structurally subject to short-term risks of contagion, it is usually just a matter of time until a few countries’ problems result in a tightening of financial conditions for the asset class as a whole.
比如，如今的大都市已面临着危险的热浪、海平面上升、极端风暴数量增加、可怕的拥挤以及空气和水污染等问题。	Today’s mega-cities, for example, already have to confront dangerous heat waves, rising sea levels, more extreme storms, dire congestion, and air and water pollution.
纽约-在最近举行的对格鲁吉亚的捐款人会议上，捐款意向滚滚不断，总计达到了4 5亿美元-大约每个格鲁吉亚公民就能获得10 00美元。	NEW YORK – At the recent donors’ meeting on Georgia, aid pledges rolled in, totaling $4.5 billion – about $1,000 per citizen of Georgia.
有鉴于此，投资者可能会倾向于对整个新兴世界实施大范围的避险手段，尤其是在全球贸易紧张局势升级的背景下。	Given this, investors may find it tempting to pursue a broad risk-off approach to the entire emerging world, especially in the context of rising global trade tensions.
可怜的难民家庭在贪婪的走私者和歹徒支配下在海上漂流的图片很容易激发怜悯和同情（而且不只是在德国 ） 。	Images of miserable refugee families drifting in the sea, at the mercy of rapacious smugglers and gangsters, can easily inspire feelings of pity and compassion (and not just in Germany).
在某些情况中，美国公司购买银行，在韩国复苏之前一直持有这些银行，随后创新出售它们，从中赚取几十亿美元的利润。	In some cases, US firms bought the banks, held on to them until Korea recovered, and then resold them, reaping billions in capital gains.
事实上，尽管莫迪言必称容忍和融和，但对于印度人民党部长和国会议员冒犯非印度教少数群体的仇恨言论，他几乎毫无反应。	Indeed, despite speaking eloquently of tolerance and accommodation, Modi has remained largely silent in the face of hate speech by BJP ministers and MPs that is alienating India’s non-Hindu minorities.
哈顿面对的是反对接纳难民的流行的理由：寻求庇护者并不是真正的绝望人群，只是利用危机作为借口进入更加富裕的国家。	Hatton confronts a popular argument against admitting refugees: that asylum-seekers are not really desperate, but are just using a crisis as a pretext for admission to a richer country.
而由于90％的底层人士收入增长已经停滞了将近1/3个世纪（且其中很大比例都出现了下滑 ） ， 医疗数据清晰明白地证实了美国大部分地区处境不妙。	But, with the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for very large swaths of the country.
10多年前，我们决定主动放弃有核国家的地位，这样的举措最清楚不过地表明了我们对邻国的善意，以及我们在政治上的成熟。	Our decision more than a decade ago to surrender Ukraine’s status as a nuclear nation is the clearest sign of our good neighborly intentions and political maturity.
在臭名昭著的严打案（Sledgehammer case）中，人们发现军事政变密谋存在重大漏洞，包括一份用Office 2007编辑的最后存盘时间在2003年的文档。	In the infamous Sledgehammer case, a military-coup plot was found to contain glaring anachronisms, including the use of Microsoft Office 2007 in documents supposedly last saved in 2003.
约350,000人已经逃离，由此造成的人道主义危机或许可以和2009年军队打破塔利班对斯瓦特山谷控制时的情况相媲美。	Some 350,000 people have already fled, creating a humanitarian crisis on a scale similar to that in 2009 when the military broke the Taliban’s grip on the Swat Valley.
事实上，越南的“水下”情况，与荷兰的大部分地区如出一辙：在那里，包括世界上最繁忙的机场之一史基浦机场在内的大片土地，在涨潮时都在位于海平面以下。	In fact, it is “underwater” in the same way that much of Holland is: there, large areas of land, including Schiphol, one of the world’s busiest airports, are below sea level at high tide.
然而他却把自己的政府和亿万富豪（不仅是百万富翁）和高盛公司大佬们搅和在一起，还让商业游说团体的这趟浑水比以往任何时候都更深了。	Yet he has stacked his administration with billionaires (not just millionaires) and Goldman Sachs alumni, while letting the swamp of business lobbyists rise higher than ever.
问其原由，只需要将打击国际恐怖主义和满足格鲁吉亚总统萨卡什维利个人野心这两者的重要性做一个比较；事情不言自明。	To see why, simply compare the importance of combating international terrorism with the value of nurturing Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s personal ambitions; things soon fall into place.
在过去三年中，11%的澳大利亚人口完成了这一课程，部分是因为工作岗位要求（如儿童看护工作）持有紧急救助资格。	In the last three years, 11% of Australia’s population has completed such a course, partly owing to requirements that people in certain positions, such as child-care workers, have a first-aid certificate.
加尔各答印度管理学院（Indian Institute of Management）估算，只有10%的易腐败粮食产品能进入冷藏设备，这意味着3.7亿吨的易腐败粮食产品白暴露在高风险之中。	The Indian Institute of Management in Kolkata estimates that cold-storage facilities are available for only 10% of perishable food products, leaving around 370 million tons of perishable products at risk.
一项南非的研究表明，总体而言，女孩面临着公开露面机会，在她们进入青春期后呈现出剧烈下降 — — 其活动空间从6.3平方英里下降到2.6平方英里。	A study in South Africa showed that, overall, girls face a drastic reduction in access to the public sphere – with spatial access falling from an area of 6.3 square miles to just 2.6 – when they reach puberty.
正如我在拙作《欧元：共同货币是如何威胁欧洲未来的》一书中所指出的那样，欧元是一个几乎从一开始就注定失败的体系。	And as I put it in my book The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe, the euro was a system almost designed to fail.
过去六年来，非洲开发银行已经投资33亿美元用于拓展饮用水和卫生设施项目，其中约22亿美元被用于至少惠及1，700万人的城市服务。	Over the past six years, the African Development Bank has invested $3.3 billion in projects to expand access to water and improve sanitation, with around $2.2 billion of that going to urban services that reach at least 17 million people.
虽然对恐怖主义的警惕有所提高，移民限制也进一步收紧，但9·11事件发生初期那种草木皆兵的状态却也逐渐缓和。	But, while concern about terrorism is greater, and immigration restrictions are tighter, the hysteria of the early days after 9/11 has abated.
但如果国际货币基金组织的组织文化未能得到改变，那么仅仅给予发展中国家更大的投选权力也就没有多大的用处。	But simply giving developing nations greater voting power will make little difference if the IMF’s organizational culture is not changed as well.
这些变革为经济复苏创造了条件，从去年开始，意大利从持续了十年的衰退中恢复；但这些改革在政治上不受欢迎，现在更是被谴责是精英主义外国压迫的象征。	These changes have created the conditions for economic recovery, which began last year, following a decade of recession; but they have been politically unpopular and are now being denounced as symbols of elitist foreign oppression.
尽管确实有必要降低公司税率，但国会共和党人在去年12月颁布的税收法案依然远未达到本该实现的收入中立。	Although a reduction in the corporate tax rate was needed, the tax bill that Congressional Republicans enacted last December was nowhere near revenue-neutral, as it should have been.
多亏来自欧盟的压力，土耳其国内的库尔德问题正在走入民主解决的轨道，土耳其国内的绝大多数库尔德领袖都表达了他们支持土耳其统一的立场。	Thanks to EU pressures, Turkey's domestic Kurdish problem is well on the way to being resolved democratically, with most Kurdish leaders in Turkey expressing their commitment to Turkish unity.
蒙塔泽里是伊朗共和国首个十年间最具影响力的人物，曾经是被众多阿亚图拉视为异端的最高领袖绝对权威的坚定捍卫者。	One of the most influential figures in Iran during the Republic’s first decade, Montazeri provided an extensive justification for the supreme leader’s absolute authority, which many ayatollahs considered heretical.
德国不但忍受了2008—2009年全球金融危机和欧洲主权债务危机，实际上在近几年中相当繁荣，GDP增长强健，工资上升显著。	The country not only endured the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the European sovereign debt crisis; it has actually thrived in recent years, experiencing robust GDP growth and impressive wage gains.
这将能够实现对捕捞成分、 丢弃物和 兼捕渔获物信息的搜集，而这反过来又将有助于最大限度地减少鲨鱼、海龟和海洋哺乳动物的意外捕获。	This will enable the collection of information such as catch composition, discards, and bycatch, which in turn will help minimize the accidental capture of sharks, turtles, and marine mammals.
这样做也许满足了荷兰人的民族主义情绪，因为荷兰的国土面积是比利时的1.5倍，但在比利时人中间却引起了轩然大波。 这两个国家在伊拉克战争���题上的立场也尖锐对立，在对待进一步政治融合的态度上也存在分歧。	But Belgium could have shown greater understanding for the Netherlands’ position after Dutch voters decisively rejected the proposed European constitution in the mid-2005 referendum.
自一个世纪前的舰炮外交时代以来，还没有一位扬基领导人如此恶劣地对待美国边境以南的国家和这些国家的公民。	Not since the days of gunboat diplomacy a century ago has a yanqui leader treated the countries south of the US border and their citizens so badly.
在这样的背景下，安倍在“温泉峰会”解决领土争议的希望破灭，而俄罗斯带着68份新商业协议回国，这一结果一点都不令人惊讶。	Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that Abe left the recent “onsen summit” with dashed hopes of resolving the territorial dispute, while Putin returned home with 68 new commercial accords.
对于日本的邻国来说，国际原子能组织的作用是不够的；各国当前的极度担忧更加有助于建立这样一个区域性机制。	For Japan’s neighbors, the International Atomic Energy Agency is not enough; their urgent worries are creating pressure to establish a regional mechanism.
尽管沙特的统治家族 — — 邵德（al-Saud）家族，承受了要求他们学习邻国榜样的巨大压力，但是内部的反对力量依然很强。	Although the Saudi ruling family, the al-Saud, is under enormous pressure to follow the example of its neighbors, internal resistance to doing so remains very strong.
贷款补贴是一种金融交易，由第三方出面以放松贷款要求���降低待还本金的方式替借款人偿还一部分贷款，从而减轻甚至免除借款国的未来还款义务。	A loan buy-down is a transaction in which a third party pays down part of a loan by softening its terms or reducing the principal outstanding, thereby releasing the borrowing country from all or some of its future repayment obligations.
发自斯德哥尔摩/墨西哥城 — — 印尼国会刚刚迈出了历史性的一步，也是令我们这个星球更加远离核武器威胁的一步。	STOCKHOLM/MEXICO CITY – Indonesia’s parliament has just taken a historic step, one that makes the planet safer from the threat of nuclear weapons.
一旦英国政治、商业和媒体领袖开始注意到这些关于英国退出之后的生活的“硬”事实，我们大可信心满满地认为选民将会决定留在欧盟。	Once Britain’s political, business, and media leaders start drawing attention to these hard facts of life after Brexit, we can be confident that voters will decide to stay in the EU.
这是可恶、没有必要并且是没有用的。 正像布什自己所说的，美国永远不会、不能也不应该驱逐1200万人，不管他们是不是合法的。	It’s hateful, needless, and futile: as Bush said himself, the US will never, could never, and should never deport twelve million people, illegal or not.
为了应对逐渐增大的亚洲安全挑战，美国及日本的领导人必须承认其合作伙伴的价值 — — 并重振公众对它的支持。	In order to confront mounting security challenges in Asia, American and Japanese leaders must acknowledge the partnership’s value – and reinvigorate public support for it.
但那样的政策几乎每次都会削弱总需求��把经济推入更深的深渊，进一步又会瓦解信心 — — 20世纪90年代国际货币基金组织给一些东亚国家就是开了这种药方，你看后来怎么样？	But those policies almost always reduced aggregate demand, pushed the economy into a deeper slump, and further undermined confidence – most recently when the International Monetary Fund insisted on them in East Asia in the 1990’s.
中国的逐步开放，将使越来越多的公司和个人能够出国追求更有吸引力的机会，而这将使中国的治理体系进一步复杂化。	But China’s gradual opening up will increasingly allow companies and individuals to cross national borders in search of more lucrative opportunities, complicating the country’s governance matrix further.
克鲁格曼的文章发表不久，一些中国经济学家开始将大约三十年前由邓小平改革带来的增长模式归类为“粗放型 ” ， 因而认定它有问题。	It was not long before some Chinese economists began to categorize the growth pattern brought about three decades ago by Deng Xiaoping’s reforms as “extensive” – and thus problematic.
如果目前对科索沃地位的谈判失败的话，阿尔巴尼亚族的极端分子将会试图把生活在那儿的10万多塞族人驱逐出去。	If the current negotiations on Kosovo’s status fail, Albanian extremists will seek to expel the more than 100,000 Serbs who live there.
由于受到世界经济中心各国金融机构决定保护自己的金融机构、资本领地免遭外围损害的怂恿，货币贬值，利率上升，信贷违约互换飙升。	Abetted by the determination of national financial authorities at the center of the world economy to protect their own institutions, capital fled from the periphery. Currencies fell, interest rates rose, and credit default swaps soared.
更重要的障碍是没有认识到市场不可能长期提供繁荣 — — 不管是为谁 — — 除非它们背后有健康的社会和良好的治理的支持。	The more significant roadblock is the missing recognition that markets cannot produce prosperity for long – for anyone – unless they are backed by healthy societies and good governance.
如果土耳其不再向欧洲靠近，那么欧盟关于它在世界政治中成功���运用了“软实力”的说法必将被大打折扣。	If Turkey pulls away from Europe, the EU’s claim that it successfully wields “soft power” in world politics will be powerfully undermined.
· 只要不把以色列的国家利益或是它的民众卷入危险，就尽可能保持与美国，欧洲和其他国家之间的最佳关系；	· To preserve the best possible relations with the United States, Europe, and other countries, as long as this does not involve risks to Israel’s national interests or its citizens;
类似地，各国依赖可再生能源的努力也没什么效果，因为被取代的基于化石燃料的能源仍然具有经济吸引力，这意味着会在其他国家或其他时间使用。	Countries’ efforts to rely on renewable energy supplies are similarly ineffective, given that the displaced fossil-fuel-based energy remains economically attractive, which means that it is used elsewhere or later.
尽管美国的最新立场并不代表美国政策发生了革命性变化，但确实与美国以前的立场，特别是克林顿政府立场有了程序和内容上的本质不同。	While the new American positions do not represent a revolutionary change in US policy, they do represent a clear procedural and indeed substantive departure from previous American positions, particularly those of the Clinton administration.
破产方案的第二个问题在于国际监管机构 — — 出于自身的法律和程序因素 — — 而无法配合一个会对本国经济造成重大影响的美国法律程序。	The second problem with the bankruptcy approach is that international regulators would find themselves unable to cooperate – for their own legal and procedural reasons – with a US process that affects a major part of their own economies.
巴勒斯坦人必须承认的现实情况包括他们面对以色列和美国在战略、政治和经济上的不平衡，被占领的事实和颠沛流离的生活所带来的挑战。	The current realities that the Palestinians must reckon with include their strategic, political, and economic imbalance vis-à-vis Israel and the US, the reality of occupation, and the challenges of diaspora life.
我们也暂且将窃听英国私人电话的丑闻放在一旁。 该丑闻最终导致了默多克最喜欢的小报《世界新闻 》 （ The News of the World）在2011年关门大吉。	Let us also put aside the scandalous hacking of private telephones in the UK, which culminated in the closure of Murdoch’s beloved tabloid The News of the World in 2011.
这就是学者们所说的“帝国反击战 ” ， 也就是曾经的殖民地民众，比如来自非洲和印度的移民在欧洲和北美站稳脚跟后，对种族和身份的标准发起挑战。	Scholars speak of “the empire striking back,” referring to former colonized peoples, such as immigrants from Africa and India, settling in Europe and North America and then challenging norms of race and identity.
桑德斯甚至大力抨击其对手希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton ） ， 因为她对早期签订的贸易协定(如1992年的北美自由贸易协定)表示赞同。	Sanders even hammers his opponent Hillary Clinton for her support of earlier trade deals such as the 1992 North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
但是这样小幅度地调高利率对缓解长期压力没有什么用处，因为投资者会期望见到更多调高利率的举动，把资金转入中国，从而增加人民币汇率的上升压力。	But such an insignificant rate hike will do little to relieve long-term pressures, because investors will expect more rate hikes and move money into China, increasing upward pressure on the yuan’s exchange rate.
支持者们坚持认为是他从根本上推动了中国向民主制度和市场经济的转型，而反对者们则指责他未能兑现实现政治和经济改革的承诺。	Whereas Wen’s supporters remain adamant that he fundamentally supported a shift toward democracy and a market economy for China, his critics lambast him for failing to fulfill his promises of political and economic reform.
根据非洲发胀和机遇法案（AGOA）和最近的倡议给予非洲国家们的优惠市场准入更为可能是一种贸易分离，也就是从某些穷国中分离贸易交给其他国家。	Preferential access for African countries, under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and more recent initiatives, seems to be largely a matter of trade diversion – taking trade from some poor countries and giving it to others.
在联合两个和多个从前的主权国家的例子中，边沁对一个问题十分敏感：向较小的国家提供较大的国家不会主宰它们的保障。	In the case of the unification of two or more previously sovereign states, Bentham is sensitive to the problem of providing assurances to the smaller states that the larger ones will not dominate them.
普京承诺恢复民族自尊心（随着俄罗斯在1991年怅然失去超级大国地位而破碎 ） 。 其核心是胁迫欧洲接受俄罗斯在苏联解体后的国家里的“特权利益”范畴。	Putin’s promise to restore national self-respect, shattered by Russia’s bitter loss of superpower status in 1991, is centered around cowing Europe into submissively accepting Russia’s sphere of “privileged interest” in the post-Soviet nations.
此外，这一安排常常涉及各种利益冲突；比如，仲裁者可能在某个案子中是“法官 ” ， 而在另一个相关案子中是利益主张者。	Moreover, this arrangement is often rife with conflicts of interest; for example, arbitrators may be a “judge” in one case and an advocate in a related case.
正如欧洲央行行长马里奥·德拉吉（Mario Draghi）所说 ： “ 公共投资没几个是高回报的 ” 。	As ECB President Mario Draghi has put it, “There aren’t many public investments with a high rate of return.”
而犹太定居者和众多支持者们则集结更大的力量来“开拓“巴勒斯坦的土地，建造更多的犹太人专属定居点，并破坏更多阿拉伯人的家园 — — 抢在所谓“冻结”政策生效之前。	Israeli settlers and their supporters then gather even more energy to expand onto more Palestinian land, build more exclusively Jewish settlements, and destroy more Arab homes before the so-called “freeze” comes into effect.
第二个因素是，法兰西共和国一向拒绝任何形式的、哪怕是最无伤害的“肯定行动”或积极性区别对待，并且在法律上予以禁止。	The second factor is the classic French Republican rejection of, and legal norms against, any form of “affirmative action,” or positive discrimination, even of the most inoffensive kind.
如果处于真正偏远开放社会的新闻传媒中途遇到像中国这种国家的消费者，满足他们的要求，那么无论是中国人还是商业状况都会获得巨大的益处。	If news outlets in physically remote open societies meet consumers in countries like China halfway, the benefits for both the Chinese and the bottom line could be enormous.
二十国集团领袖承认全球复苏有赖于新兴经济体（也就是发展中国家 ） ， 并通过了旨在帮助全球最脆弱人群脱贫的投资计划。	Recognizing that global recovery depends on the emerging economies – that is, the developing world – G-20 leaders embraced investments aimed at lifting the world’s most vulnerable people out of poverty.
萨波洛斯基指出由心理学家戈登·阿尔波特（Gordon Allport）发展出来的“接触理论”可以促进对手之间的和解，并帮助弥合“敌/我”之间的对立。	For Sapolsky, “contact theory,” which was developed in the 1950s by psychologist Gordon Allport, can foster reconciliation among rivals, and help bridge the “us-them” divide.
蔡美儿从不允许她的两个女儿索菲亚和路易斯看电视，打游戏，在同学家过夜或者参与学校活动，而是让她们每日苦练钢琴或小提琴。	Chua’s daughters, Sophia and Louise, were never allowed to watch television, play computer games, sleep over at a friend’s home, or be in a school play. They had to spend hours every day practicing the piano or violin.
而且，从那以后，欧盟已经接近完成甚至更加重要的与日本的贸易协定，同时接近协议签署的还包括与阿根廷、巴西、巴拉圭和乌拉圭在内的南方共同市场创始国。	And, since then, the EU has moved closer to finalizing an even more important trade agreement with Japan, and, separately, with the founding countries of Mercosur – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
2015年6月，我在推特上主持了他��她计划的聊天活动。 虽然谈话从总体来看非常积极，但仍然出现了某种显著的担忧：男性为什么要帮助女性得到他们自己都希望得到的职务？	In June 2015, I hosted a HeForShe chat on Twitter , and while the conversation was overwhelmingly positive, an obvious concern surfaced: Why should men help promote women to positions for which they themselves are aiming?
到了面对现实的时刻了 ： （ 伊拉克）北部的库尔德地区秩序良好，它甚至已经缓和了土耳其对其存在会加剧本国库尔德人问题的恐惧。	It is time to face reality: the Kurdish region in the north is functioning in a reasonable way, and it has even been able to allay Turkey’s fears that its existence will aggravate that country’s own Kurdish problem.
民主改革最有力的宣传者不是美国或欧洲的官员，而是了解西方优劣的地区百姓－这些人不但要深入了解，还要与当地条件有机地结合，推动社会走向变革。	The most effective advocates for democratic change are not American or European officials, but citizens of the region who understand Western virtues as well as flaws - and can adapt them to indigenous conditions to press for social change.
最后一点但不是最次要的一点就是，世行需要在环境问题和在总体上来说在穷国和富国中促进良好的国际公民项目上发挥更大的作用。	Last but not least, the Bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and, in general, in promoting good international citizenship by both rich and poor countries.
这可以从克里任命出生在英国的澳大利亚公民、在20世纪80年代初以AIPAC为政治生涯起点的马丁·因迪克（Martin Indyk）为美国首席谈判促进员上一窥端倪。	Tellingly, Kerry appointed Martin Indyk – a British-born Australian citizen, who began his political career in the US working for AIPAC in the early 1980s – as the principal US facilitator.
而富裕阶层的问题则在于，除了军事领域之外，最可供开支削减的领域莫过于那些主要为穷人和工薪阶级的领域。	The problem for the rich is that, other than military spending, there is no place to cut the budget other than in areas of core support for the poor and working class.
今天，世界充满了动态的复杂性，基于科学、快速变迁的全球经济使得如此之多的现象互相交错，以至于我们无法通过根据过去的线性外推来预测未来。	Today’s dynamic complexity, in which a science-based, fast-changing global economy makes so many more phenomena interdependent, prevents us from foreseeing the future through linear extrapolations of the past.
发自伦敦 — — 美联储推迟提高利率的决定对于一直关注该机构主席珍娜·耶伦（Janet Yellen）言论的人来说不足为奇。	LONDON – The US Federal Reserve’s decision to delay an increase in interest rates should have come as no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s comments.
但是，尽管该税税基稳固，收税成本低，但在低收入国家中，消费税只占GDP的2%以下，而高收入国家则要占GDP的3%左右。	But, despite their robust base and low administrative costs, excise taxes currently amount to less than 2% of low-income countries’ GDP, compared to roughly 3% in high-income countries.
这应该已是众人皆知的秘密，但普京未必，他眼里只有短期战术胜利 — — 通常形式是让美国眼红 — — 这在叙利亚也可一窥端倪。	That much should be clear to virtually everyone, if not to Putin, whose obsession with short-term tactical victories – which usually take the form of poking the United States in the eye – can also be seen in Syria.
第三，欲保持其在世界市场 — — 价格主要用美元计价 — — 占比的出口国选择保持美元价格稳定以避免成为不利汇率波动的受害者。	And, third, exporters who wish to preserve their share in world markets – where prices are largely denominated in dollars – choose to keep their dollar prices stable, to avoid falling victim to idiosyncratic exchange-rate movements.
通过有约束力的联合国安理会决议，科索沃可以被授予对其公民和领土全面和唯一的管辖权，以及在国际层面采取行动的有限权力。	By means of a binding UN Security Council resolution, Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory, as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene.
他说，对美联储而言在1990年代末将股价控制在一个合理的平衡区间的唯一办法就是把利率加高到对经济当头一棒的水平。	The only way, he says, for the Fed to have kept stock prices in reasonable equilibrium ranges in the late 1990’s would have been to raise interest rates so high that they hit the real economy on the head with a brick.
大学校长必须致力于增加本校的引用记录，尽管他们知道这些数据的准确性和有效性以及它们所衍生的排名大有可疑。	University presidents must work to boost their institutions’ citation records, even though they know that the validity and reliability of these data, and the rankings that they inform, are questionable.
根据欧洲经济区协定的安排，挪威（以及冰岛）拥有全部且不受阻碍地进入欧洲单一市场的权限，其中包括金融服务。	Under the EEA arrangement, Norway (along with Iceland) has full, unfettered access to the EU’s single market, including for financial services.
因此，该方式的主要支持者（卡尔德隆、前哥伦比亚总统乌里韦、前任和现任巴西总统以及美国保守派和安全机构）正在失去公众支持。	Consequently, the main advocates of this approach (Calderón, former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, the current and former presidents of Brazil, and America’s conservatives and security establishment) are losing public support.
正如1973年赎罪日战争后苏伊士运河沿岸埃及城镇的复苏为以色列-埃及和平铺平了道路，繁荣的加沙也将符合所有参与方的利益 — — 首先就是以色列。	Just as the rehabilitation of the Egyptian towns along the Suez Canal in the wake of the 1973 Yom Kippur war paved the way for an Israeli-Egyptian peace, a prosperous Gaza would serve the interests of all parties involved – beginning with Israel.
今年，是伽利略首次使用望远镜的400周年，同时被宣布为“国际天文年 ” 。 看来正是让我们温故康德老先生“惊奇和敬畏”这句话的恰当时候。	This year, the 400th anniversary of Galileo’s first use of a telescope, has been declared the International Year of Astronomy, so this seems a good time to ponder Kant’s first source of “awe and reverence.”
西班牙语国家则通过在移民原籍及其所在国提供各种银行服务、推出与移民利益有特殊关系的产品和手续费低廉的跨国汇款服务来吸引移民参与银行业务。	The Hispanic approach emphasizes migrants’ involvement in banking by offering a range of banking services in both the country of origin and the host country, products of specific interest to migrants, and low commissions on foreign transfers.
该机构对2,4-D等物质进行风险评估时考虑了其在土壤及附近水源中的含量、经过施用地块动物接触及人类直接接触概率等现实世界变量。	This body evaluates the risks of substances like 2,4-D, considering real-world variables such as the amounts in soil and nearby water, exposure to animals passing through treated fields, and the potential for direct human contact.
例如，它可能实现对自然资源更环保及更高效的利用，或者投资于更适应人类需要也能更好地与人类互动的各项服务。	For example, it could lead to more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient uses of natural resources, or to investment in services that are more responsive to human needs and better attuned to human interaction.
俄国棋迷因为费舍尔前所未有的成就而兴奋不已，据说莫斯科电话线路因为他们纷纷打电话了解相关信息而陷入了瘫痪。	Russian fans were so excited by Fischer’s unprecedented achievement that they reportedly jammed Moscow telephone exchanges to get information.
选举获胜后特朗普的言论和行动，再加上外界对他作为冲动恶霸和坚信世界是一个霍布斯丛林的普遍看法，已经说服了中国的领导者他希望挑起一场战争。	Trump’s statements and actions since the election, together with his broader reputation as an impulsive bully and apparent belief that the world is a Hobbesian jungle, have convinced the Chinese leadership that he is itching for a fight.
有可能，甚至可以说有极大的可能，2014年美国增长速度将能够创造足够的就业岗位容纳劳动力市场新晋大军而有余。	It is possible, even likely, that US growth in 2014 will be rapid enough to create more jobs than required for new entrants into the labor force.
当然，如果克林顿当选总统，那么她与其他决策者一起，将出色地证明多样性在推动美国成功方面所起到的领导作用。	Of course, a President Clinton, along with other policymakers, would do well to underscore the leading role that diversity has played in driving America’s success.
受到关押的300名黎巴嫩人都没有受到指控或者审判，将近1000名巴勒斯坦囚犯中许多人也是如此。 但是，这已经是该地区阿拉伯人不满情绪的主要根源。	But holding 300 Lebanese and nearly 10,000 Palestinians – all of the first group and many of the second group without charge or trial – has proven to be a major source of irritation to the Arab peoples of the region.
许多国家的银行系统也比以前更加可靠，而它们的公共和私人债务比率尽管有所上升，仍处于较低水平，偿债能力风险很小。	Many also have sounder banking systems, while their public and private debt ratios, though rising, are still low, with little risk of insolvency.
在世界许多地方，二十世纪的城市发展战略创造了以汽车为中心的庞大城市；但城市化速度的加快使得这一方案无以为继。	In many parts of the world, twentieth-century urban development strategies created sprawling, car-centered cities; but accelerating rates of urbanization have made this approach unsustainable.
即便如此，在对新兴经济体未来前景的忧虑日渐增加之时，中国因其规模以及在全球贸易架构（以及全球金融）中的中心地位而成为了焦点。	Even so, amid growing concerns about emerging economies’ prospects, China is attracting attention because of its scale and central position in the structure of global trade (and, increasingly, global finance).
只有这样美国才能真正提升其竞争力，并使政府可以在保持合理增长率的同时将私人和公共债务都降低到一个可持续的水平上。	Only then will America improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respectable growth rate.
但即便是资本市场在企业融资中扮演着更重要角色的英美两国，资产价格的膨胀也无力去鼓励消费者消费或企业投资。	But, even in the US and Britain, where capital markets play a much larger role in corporate finance, asset-price inflation did little to encourage consumers to spend or companies to invest.
让沃尔福威茨入主世行的主要功绩是一手制造了伊拉克战争，虽然现在仍有争论，但这场战争被视为自拿破仑入侵俄国之后最严重的战略失败。	Wolfowitz’s pre-Bank claim to fame was his role as an architect of the Iraq war, arguably one of the greatest strategic debacles since Napoleon’s invasion of Russia.
中国现在是世界第二大国民经济体，而且填补了西方债权人撤退所留下的空白，同时也成为全球新兴市场最主要的信贷供应国。	China is now the world’s second-largest national economy and the leading supplier of credit to emerging markets globally, having filled the gap left by retreating Western creditors.
用进口弥补储量的下降 — — 大约一半的天然气储量和五分之一石油储量已经被用掉了 — — 意味着每年要花去3000亿美元以上的成本。	Covering this drop in reserves – more than half of gas reserves and a fifth of oil reserves have been consumed – with imports implies an annual cost of more than $300 billion.
当它产生严重且系统性失败时，不管是在战场上 — — 正如1940年在法国 — — 还是在公司董事会或工厂车间，它的受欢迎程度都会迅速衰落。	Its popularity can ebb quickly when it becomes associated with crippling and systemic failure, whether on the battlefield – as in France in 1940 – or in the corporate boardroom and on the factory floor.
坎布里奇—去年波澜壮阔的市场波动在很大程度上要归因于中国增长、欧洲银行和石油过剩等因素的真风险和不确定性。	CAMBRIDGE – The phenomenal market volatility of the past year owes much to genuine risks and uncertainties about factors such as Chinese growth, European banks, and the oil glut.
斯德哥尔摩—来自北约多国的军用车队在瑞典西部港口卸货，蜂拥驶入瑞典的街道，让警方不得不发布交通警告。	STOCKHOLM – Having debarked from ports in western Sweden, military convoys from various NATO countries are crowding Swedish streets and prompting the police to issue traffic warnings.
换言之，审议式民主可能是我们对付刚愎自用、不计后果的行动的最重要的防范措施。 它在联合国、而不是美国发挥了作用。	In other words, deliberative democracy ­­– perhaps our most important safeguard against headstrong and reckless action – worked at the UN, but not in the US.
如果年度卫生援助能增加100—150亿美元（即高收入国家居民每人再拿出10—15美元 ） ， 达到每年400亿美元，那么未来几年还能取得更大进步。	Another $10-15 billion in annual aid (that is, roughly $10-15 more per person in the high-income world), bringing total aid to around $40 billion per year, would enable still greater progress to be made in the coming years.
他也深度参与了千年挑战公司（Millennium Challenge Corporation）的建立，该公司为符合明确而具体的经济和政治标准的国家提供援助。	And he was deeply involved in establishing the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which provides aid to countries that meet clearly specified economic and political criteria.
更为重要的是，尼日利亚已采取措施确保出售资源的获益将会被再投资，这样，在自然资源枯竭的时候，国家真正的财富 - - 固定资本和人力资本 - - 才会有所增加。	Most importantly, the Nigerians are taking measures to ensure that the fruits of this endowment are invested, so that as the country's natural resources are depleted, its real wealth - fixed and human capital - is increased.
其次，非洲正在经历一次以快速数字化、城市化和劳动年龄人口增长为特色的深刻的长期转型，非洲劳动人口截止2034年将在数量上超过中国和印度。	Second, Africa is undergoing a profound long-term transformation, characterized by rapid digitization, urbanization, and growth in the working-age population, which will outnumber the labor force of China and India by 2034.
举个例子，宝马Mini的曲轴在车辆完工的过程中要三次跨越英吉利海峡，这意味着任何出入境的延迟都会影响到这条供应链的盈利能力。	To take just one example, the crankshaft of a BMW Mini crosses the English Channel three times before the car is completed, which means that any delay at the border will destroy the profitability of that supply chain.
如果基于对程序及其影响的了解，一个国家的大部分民众认定某项研究有违道德，则政府必须按照民主原则做出回应。	If, based on an understanding of the processes and their implications, a majority of a country’s citizens find them to controvert morality, democratic principles would demand a government response.
据《非洲饥饿的成本 》 （ Cost of Hunger in Africa）的研究，非洲身高不足儿童与营养优良儿童的受教育年限差距高达3.6年。	According to the Cost of Hunger in Africa studies, stunted children across the continent receive up to 3.6 fewer years of schooling than well-nourished children.
食品更丰富，价格也更便宜了，尤其是在发展中国家，其人均卡路里的可提供量在过去40年间增加了40 % ， 而食品的价格则下降了一半多。	Food has become more plentiful and affordable, especially in the developing world, where calorie availability has increased by 40% per person over the past 40 years, while food prices have more than halved.
然而根据日本银行的研究，税收数据表明增长比官方数字高出超过三个百分点，这意味着GDP规模比官方报告的数字多出约30万亿日元（约3000亿美元 ） 。	Yet, according to Bank of Japan researchers, tax data suggest that growth was more than three percentage points higher than the official figure, implying that GDP was some ¥30 trillion (about $300 billion dollars) larger than officially reported.
但事实是，随着普通俄罗斯人福利的下降 — — 以及普京亲信财富继续增加 — — 俄罗斯伟大论听上去不再真实。	But the fact remains that as average Russians’ wellbeing has declined – and Putin cronies’ wealth has continued to swell – proclamations of Russia’s greatness have begun to ring hollow.
但随着IT业的发展，垄断财富急剧增长；到了2015年12月，垄断财富达到了股市总市值的82 % — —大约相当于23.8万亿美元。	But as the IT industry developed, monopoly wealth rose dramatically; it reached 82% of total stock-market value – equivalent to some $23.8 trillion – in December 2015.
与东亚和印度不同，多数拉美国家都没有在高科技领域取得突破，这些国家受到国内生产总值增长缓慢、债务危机和宏观经济不稳定等因素的困扰。	Unlike East Asia and India, most of Latin America did not make a breakthrough to high-technology industries, instead suffering a period of low GDP growth, debt crises, and macroeconomic instability.
在二十世纪九十年代，私人投资者把行动迟缓的中央银行看作现金金牛，它们有的是钱但是却缺乏敏锐的金融洞察力。	During the 1990’s, private investors looked at big, lumbering central banks as cash cows, long on money and short on financial acumen.
北欧国家税收基础广阔，相对无偷税漏税现象。 开办国际贸易、市场力量和产业私有化均有赖于保持激励机制。	Taxation is broad-based and relatively non-distorting, while open international trade, market forces, and private ownership of industry are relied on to maintain incentives.
如果中国不能对已有的总资产和总负债动太大的手脚，那么应该修正新的资产和负债，以使未来资本损失最小化。	If China cannot do very much about existing gross assets and gross liabilities, it should address new assets and liabilities in order to minimize future capital losses.
实际上，铲除罂粟作物不但破坏了当地民生、阻碍了国际社会实现其目标，而且也是失败的：去年的鸦片生产创历史新高。	In fact, the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community’s goals, but it is also failing: opium production last year was at an all-time high.
2008年，共和党聚集在已故参议员约翰·麦凯恩的竞选伙伴莎拉·佩林的身后，佩林是个来自民间的煽动分子，比布什或切尼更不适合担任公共职务；而2010年，该党实际上被民粹主义的茶党所劫持。	In 2008, Republicans rallied behind the late Senator John McCain’s running mate, Sarah Palin, a folksy demagogue who was even less suited for office than Bush or Cheney; and in 2010, the party was essentially hijacked by the populist Tea Party.
另一位万事达基金会学者米兰达最近指出 ， “ 当我们想找到新的创造和发明来推动经济发展时，我相信数学和科学处在进步的前沿位置 。 ”	As Miranda, another Mastercard Foundation scholar, recently observed, “As we try to find new innovations and inventions to drive the economy, I believe that math and science is at the forefront of that progress.”
受困国需要提高生产率，这一点是毫无疑问的，但在当前极端的紧缩和通缩气候下，要达到这一目标是不可能的任务，因为潜在或公开社会冲突相当激烈。	The need for higher productivity in the troubled countries is undeniable; but achieving it in the current climate of extreme austerity and deflation is unlikely, given an atmosphere of latent, or open, social conflict.
在阅读这份会议记录时，我想到了遥远的历史，足以追溯到1825年及以前。 在历史上，不受控制的大银行倒闭会触发恐慌、逃向质量、资产价格的崩溃，以及萧条。	As I read the transcripts, I recalled the long history dating back to 1825, and before, in which the uncontrolled failure of major banks triggered panic, a flight to quality, the collapse of asset prices, and depression.
在北非，教育制度和就业市场的不匹配导致受过良好教育的年轻人找不到体面的工作机会 — — 这一局面催生了阿拉伯之春革命。	In North Africa, the disharmony between the education system and the job market left young, educated people without decent opportunities – a situation that contributed to the revolutions of the Arab Spring.
IMF的模拟测试结果表明，全球增长率下降1.5个百分点将通过其对贸易和金融流的影响，光是在2012年就将造成270亿美元的外部融资缺口。	Simulations by the International Monetary Fund suggest that a decline in global growth of 1.5 percentage points could, owing to its impact on trade and financial flows, generate a $27 billion gap in additional external financing in 2012 alone.
汉密尔顿针对詹姆斯·麦迪逊和托马斯·杰斐逊的观点争锋相对地指出，各州在独立战争期间所积累的债务应该被认为是联邦债务。	Hamilton argued – against James Madison and Thomas Jefferson – that the debts accumulated by the states during the War of Independence should be assumed by the federation.
而这将通过协助确保金枪鱼种群实现可持续捕捞、要求在上述水域捕鱼的外国船只仅在法律允许的范围内实施捕捞来促进该地区的未来繁荣。	And it would promote future prosperity by helping to ensure that tuna stocks are fished sustainably, and that foreign vessels fishing in these waters do not take more than is permitted by law.
成千上万的无辜病人 — — 也许还有更多 — — 在这种新一代的两种新药被召回之前承受了ADR’s的痛苦。	Tens of thousands of innocent patients – perhaps more – suffered such ADR’s before the first two drugs of this class were withdrawn.
但为了避免签署仅仅是重申或重新谈判现有承诺的新协议，世界领袖必须立即采取行动奠定制度和法律基础，以便落实之前的提案并争取更多进步。	But, to avoid entering into new agreements that merely re-state or re-negotiate existing commitments, world leaders must act now to lay the institutional and legal groundwork for operationalizing previous proposals and make further progress.
事实上，在无人区和自然保护区之外，因为苏联解体后的重大社会经济变化加剧了农村贫困并破坏了野生动物管理，麋鹿和野猪种群出现了大幅减少的势头。	Indeed, in areas outside the zone or nature reserves, populations of elk and wild boar underwent steep declines, as major socioeconomic changes after the fall of the Soviet Union worsened rural poverty and crippled wildlife management.

TPP的谈判过程是最高机密，甚至立法者也无从看到谈判中的全部内容，尽管公司游说集团在起草过程中被视为伙伴。	The TPP is being crafted in utmost secrecy, with even legislators unable to see the full text that is being negotiated, though corporate lobbyists have been treated as partners in the drafting process.

中国的投资狂热不禁让人想起了20世纪80年代的日本，当时是，高铁延伸到了日本的每个角落，偏远地区也没有落下。	China’s investment frenzy reminds many people of Japan in the 1980’s, when high-speed rail links were extended to Japan’s remotest corners.
相反，美国总是选择华尔街银行家和政客来担任这一职务，大概是为了保证世行政策能够符合美国商业和政治利益吧。	Instead, the US has selected Wall Street bankers and politicians, presumably to ensure that the Bank’s policies are suitably friendly to US commercial and political interests.
出生于匈牙利的作家亚瑟·克斯特勒（Arthur Koestler）从前是共产党，他熟知所有关于欧洲政治灾难的事，曾经险些被西班牙法西斯分子处决，1940年逃到了英国。	The Hungarian-born writer Arthur Koestler, a former Communist who knew all about European political catastrophes, and was almost executed by Spanish fascists, escaped to Britain in 1940.
但是，有些（可能是很多）小企业的境况就大不相同了，它们饱受资金缺乏困扰，无法成长，不少还被迫收缩规模。	Some, perhaps many, small businesses are, however, in a very different position; strapped for funds, they can’t grow, and many are being forced to contract.
在十六世纪，奴隶主入侵其他加勒比岛屿绑架工人，把他们卖到伊斯帕尼奥拉岛（今天的多米尼加共和国和海地 ） 。	In the sixteenth century, slavers invaded other Caribbean islands to abduct workers and sell them to gold miners on the island of Hispaniola (today’s Dominican Republic and Haiti).
但就连善意的气候变化倡导者和决策者往往也反对 1.5°C的目标，他们认为根据科学，人类已经排放的温室气体已经使得该目标几乎不可能实现了。	But even well-meaning climate advocates and policymakers often opposed the 1.5°C target, arguing that, according to the science, humans had already emitted enough greenhouse gases to make meeting that goal virtually impossible.
12月8日，一家由移民创建由私人投资者出资的美国公司SpaceX成功地将一艘飞船送入轨道，并成功地在太平洋上对其进行了回收。	On December 8, a US company, SpaceX, founded by an immigrant and financed mostly by private US investors, successfully launched a spacecraft into orbit and then recovered it from a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.
中东地区的输家也非常明确：感觉生存受到威胁、开始将国内什叶派���数族裔视为伊朗第五纵队的沙特阿拉伯和其他海湾国家。	The losers in the region are also clear: Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states, which feel existentially threatened, and have come to regard their own Shia minorities as an Iranian fifth column.
极低利率通过两��方式推高资产价格：它们增加股票或固定收入债券的未来收入流的现值；它们让获得信用和购买房产变得更加容易负担。	Ultra-low interest rates lift asset prices in two ways: they increase the present value of the future income stream of a stock or a fixed-income bond; and they make credit and property purchases more affordable.
在凯尔特之虎时期 — — 在这段时间里，爱尔兰在欧洲经济竞赛中独拔头筹 — — 所积累的财富也是有效的冲击吸收器。	Ireland’s accumulation of wealth during its Celtic Tiger period, when the country surged toward the top of Europe’s economic league table, has also been an effective shock absorber.
随着政府推行强有力的社会和环境政策，与发展有关的争论会进一步升级：比如有人会说，高额的燃油税会扼杀我们新生的汽车工业。	Growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies: higher gasoline taxes, for example, will kill our nascent auto industry.
事实上，还有什么能够解释向瑞士这样禀赋优渥国家，或像尼日利亚这样人口众多的国家会在奥运会上表现如此糟糕呢？	Indeed, how else to explain the poor performance of a country as well-endowed as Switzerland, or as highly populated as Nigeria?
大片未开垦的土地、年轻劳动力和技术精湛的“农业企业家 ” （ agropreneurs）的出现正在提升产量并改革整个经济体。	Large tracts of uncultivated land, a youthful workforce, and the emergence of tech-savvy “agropreneurs” – agricultural entrepreneurs – are lifting production and transforming entire economies.
如果即将到来的关键的几周能够取得预期的结果，那么这个上世纪末曾被民族主义蹂躏的国家可能公然挑战今天全球盛行的沙文主义潮流。	If the coming crucial weeks end well, a region that was ravaged by nationalism at the end of the last century could now defy today’s global lurch toward chauvinism.
比如一杯打折的拿铁咖啡。 虽然拿铁的制作原料随取随有，但商店的空间以及咖啡制作者的劳动却是消逝性资产。	The latte’s ingredients will remain available, but the space in the shop and the work of the people who will prepare the latte are vanishing assets.
专家组推断在低炭能源的研究和开发上进行投资是一个更可靠和更有效的选择－这是麦凯恩和奥巴马都支持的方法。	The expert panel concluded that investing in research and development into low-carbon energy would be a much sounder, more effective option – an effort that both McCain and Obama support.
阿列克谢耶娃被迫在监禁或流亡当中作出选择，她选择流亡美国，并在那里继续为捍卫苏联人权发挥了重要作用。	Alexeyeva was given the choice of prison or exile, and chose exile in the United States, where she continued to play an important role in defending human rights in the Soviet Union.
奥巴马已经明确表示美国理解莫迪与俄罗斯合作的意愿 — — 甘冒西方对俄制裁之大不韪 — — 来自印度对遏制中俄联盟的渴望。	Obama has already made it clear that the US understands that Modi’s willingness to cooperate with Russia, despite Western sanctions imposed on the country, stems from India’s desire to discourage a Sino-Russian alliance against it.
作为长期投资者，主权财富基金有助于通过金融中介消除市场波动性，并能为具有积极但产期回报率的项目融资。	As long-term investors, SWFs can help to reduce market volatility through financial intermediation, as well as contribute to financing projects with positive but long-term rates of return.
过去 20 年来一直统治智利政治的大致权力平衡将在皮涅拉的四年任期中得以延续：只有双方协商的修修补补才会成为可能。	The rough balance of power that has characterized Chilean politics over the past 20 years will continue during Piñera’s four-year term: only incremental, negotiated change will be possible.
社会选择研究第一次步入正式学科是在十九世纪末，先驱式法国数学家，主要包括波尔达（J. C. Borda）和马奎斯·孔多塞（Marquis de Condorcet ） 。	The study of social choice as a formal discipline first came into its own in the late eighteenth century, when the subject was pioneered by French mathematicians, particularly J. C. Borda and Marquis de Condorcet.
我们走出这个监狱后的唯一希望是，有另一个国家决定为像我们这样的人 — — 我们这些没有做错任何事情，一开始就不应该被关押在这里的人 — — 提供安全的栖身之地。	Our only hope of getting out of this prison is that another country decides to provide safe haven to men like us – men who did nothing wrong and never should have been detained here in the first place.
首先，欧盟应该承诺每年至少吸收500,000寻求庇护者，同时努力说服世界其他地区也接收相同数量的难民。	For starters, the EU should commit to absorbing at least 500,000 asylum-seekers a year, while working to convince the rest of the world to accept an equal number.
利率的上升会让他们面对现实：购房的贷款利息将会占家庭预算的更大一部分，这是我们最终必须面对的严峻现实。	Interest rate increases will deliver a fresh dose of reality: the interest expense of owning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budgets, a hard fact that will eventually sink into our thinking.
事实上，让他的遗书更加感人的是，他要求将校方欠他的资金拿出一部分给他的家人，用于偿还他因为被取消助学金而欠下的债务。	In fact, intensifying his letter’s pathos, he requested that part of the money the university owes him be paid to his family to cover debts he incurred as a result of being denied his fellowship.
但如果中东地区最伟大的和平使者安瓦尔·萨达特和伊扎克·拉宾被刺的悲剧曾经留给过我们什么教训，那就是战火熄灭的时间不会太长。	But if we have learned anything at all from the tragic assassinations of the region’s greatest peacemakers, Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin, it is that the guns do not remain silent for long.
英国国防开支作为政府全部开支的一部分，已经从1998年占全部政府开支的7.8%下降到2006年的6.1 % 。	As a share of total government spending, defense expenditure has fallen from 7.8% in 1998 to 6.1% in 2006.
美国人对社会流动性有着根深蒂固的乐观主义，该认知发源于美国的历史，并且总会有一些底层移民的致富故事来打鸡血。	Americans have deep-seated, optimistic views about social mobility, opinions that are rooted in US history and bolstered by narratives of rags-to-riches immigrants.
罗雅尔越发回归社会党的“经典 ” ， 萨尔科奇越发公开寻求极右翼的支持，贝鲁的受欢迎程度就越发高涨。	The more Royal returns to the “classics” of the Socialist Party, and the more Sarkozy openly courts the extreme right, the more Bayrou’s popularity rises.
事实上，可能世界上一些著名的领导人，包括英国首相戈登·布朗，德国总理安格拉·默克尔以及联合国秘书长潘基文，将不会出席奥运会开幕式。	Indeed, it is likely that several prominent world leaders, including British Prime Minster Gordon Brown, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, will not attend the opening ceremonies.
在相当现实的层面上，央行的行为永远是“财政政策 ” ， 原因很简单，它们的干���改变了未来政府本金和利息支付的现值。	The actions of central banks have always been “fiscal policy” in a very real sense, simply because their interventions alter the present value of future government principal and interest payments.
事实上，在最贫困群体中，基本收入能缓解目前严重超负荷工作的人的一些压力 — — 特别是女性，从而增强工作的尊严和凝聚力增强效应。	In fact, among the poorest groups, basic incomes would enhance the dignity- and solidarity-enhancing effects of work, by easing some of the pressure on people – particularly women – who are now vastly overworked.
2010年量化宽松开始时，消费物价指数上涨1.6 % ， 2011年和2012年有所增加，2013年（资产购买高峰之年）回落至1.5 % 。	The consumer price index rose by 1.6% in 2010, when quantitative easing began, then increased somewhat faster in 2011 and 2012, before dropping back to a gain of just 1.5% in 2013, the peak year for asset purchases.
当事实证明情况恰恰相反，随着西方国家的制裁变得越来越难以承受，克林姆林宫开始寻求对华投资和贸易机会。	When that turned out not to be the case, and Western sanctions became increasingly painful, the Kremlin began seeking investment and trade opportunities with China.
中国还在其邻近东亚的战略利益范围之外实施了一系列外交举措，并积极参与到了2015年伊朗核协定等外交倡议之中。	China has also launched diplomatic initiatives beyond its immediate sphere of strategic interest in East Asia, as well as actively participating in initiatives such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
欧元区内部的固定汇率便是一种约束，而这种约束在英国和美国内部是不存在的，此外，英格兰银行和美联储的量化宽松都是无条件的。	Fixed exchange rates within the eurozone impose a constraint that simply does not exist in the UK or the United States, and quantitative easing by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve is unconditional in nature.
布鲁塞尔和欧洲其他首都的领袖知道欧盟必须对民众日益增长的不满情绪作出反应，并且 — — 这样做可以获得政治资本的一天终于到来了。	In Brussels and a number of Europe’s capitals, leaders know that the EU must respond to mounting discontent, and that – at long last – there is political capital to be gained in doing so.
他们是在加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛的泛阿拉伯民族主义教育下长大的。 对他们来说，最重要的政治事件是1967年阿以战争中阿拉伯的失利。	They were weaned on Gamal Abdel-Nasser’s pan-Arab nationalism, and the crucial political event for them was the Arab defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
在吃牛肉合法的地方，不但穆斯林和其他少数群体消费牛肉，许多较穷的印度教徒也消费牛肉，因为他们消费不起其他肉类。	Where beef was legally available, it was consumed not just by Muslims and other minorities, but also by many poorer Hindus, who could not afford other kinds of meat.
脊髓灰质炎公共卫生紧急状况持续不断正在危及全球根除脊髓灰质炎行动（GPEI）的成功，自1988年启动以来，世界各国已累计投入150亿美元用于这项行动；同时还威胁到全球公共卫生。	The continuing polio PHEIC is endangering the success of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), into which the world has invested $15 billion since it was launched in 1988; and it threatens global health generally.
这也是由英国前首相戴维·卡梅伦担任主席的伦敦经济学院（LSE ） - 牛津国家脆弱性、增长和发展委员会在4月所达成协议的意义。	That is the implication of conclusions reached in April by the LSE-Oxford Commission on State Fragility, Growth, and Development, chaired by former British Prime Minister David Cameron.
世界银行的新数据表明，极端贫困人口比例在过去30年中下降了一大半，从1981年占总人口的42%下降到2010年的17 % 。	New data from the World Bank show that the proportion of extremely poor people has more than halved over the last 30 years, from 42% of the global population in 1981 to 17% in 2010.
而且，最近有消息指出在2016年马纳福特仍担任竞选主席期间，他提出为某俄罗斯寡头提供有关总统竞选现状的情况汇报。	Also, it was recently revealed that in 2016, while Manafort was still campaign chair, he offered to conduct briefings for a Russian oligarch about the presidential campaign.
基因驱动开发者花了数百万美元将这项技术包装成实现宏伟的健康和保护目标的速效药，包括联合国2030年可持续发展目标中所列出的那些目标。	Gene-drive developers have spent millions of dollars trying to sell this technology as a quick fix for achieving ambitious health and conservation goals, such as those outlined in the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
英国尤其如此。 英国政府急切地希望在2015年大选前实现经济复苏，要求英格兰银行引入信用补贴以及最近提出的前瞻性指引。	This is particularly obvious in the UK, where the government, desperate to see an economic recovery before the 2015 elections, has been pushing the BoE to introduce credit subsidies and, more recently, forward guidance.
国际足联前主席乔·阿维兰热常常梦想在以色列和巴勒斯坦之间举行一场足球比赛：美国副总统戈尔曾将这样的比赛视作帮助华盛顿解决巴以冲突的方法之一。	The former president of the FIFA, Joao Havelange, often dreamed of a football match between Israelis and Palestinians: the American vice-president Al Gore regarded such a match as a means to help Washington solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
土耳其还是去了一些地区盟友，特别是海湾君主国家，后者对埃尔多安政府无条件支持埃及穆斯林兄弟会十分恼怒。	Turkey has also lost several regional allies, particularly some of the Gulf monarchies, which are angry at the Erdoğan government’s unconditional support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
在1988年其人均GDP仅相当于美国的4 ％ （ 按购买力平价计算 ） ， 今年这一比率已接近30 ％ — —在短短三十年内几乎增长了八倍。	Back in 1988, its per capita GDP was just 4% of the US level (in purchasing-power-parity terms). This year, that ratio is close to 30% – nearly an eightfold increase in just three decades.
首先，海上封锁(这让人回想其古巴导弹危机)中断伊朗的石油出口以及提炼燃料的进口将会让该国的经济限于瘫痪。	First, a naval blockade (reminiscent of the Cuban missile crisis) that halted both Iran’s oil exports and imports of refined fuel would cripple the country’s economy.
但中央银行的成功也催生了过高的期望，这促使大多数政策制定者放手让货币部门去承担起宏观经济管理的主要责任。	But central banks’ successes fueled excessively high expectations, which encouraged most policymakers to leave their monetary counterparts largely responsible for macroeconomic management.
第三点主要区别是今天因为有了奇妙的技术，我们有机会解决产生那么多火药桶的潜在的贫困、饥饿、流离失所和环境破坏问题。	The third major difference is that today, with our wondrous technologies, we have every opportunity to solve the underlying problems of poverty, hunger, displacement, and environmental degradation that create so many dangerous tinderboxes.
赛后辛格提出“印度和巴基斯坦应当携手努力寻求合作方案，并需要实现永久性的和解以确保两国能有尊严地共存。	After the match, Singh said that “India and Pakistan should be working together to find cooperative solutions and need permanent reconciliation to live together in dignity and honor.
类似地，真主党的保护人伊朗要致力于巴勒斯坦“伊斯兰抵抗力量 ” ， 这也无非是回收了其在特朗普的决定前便早已开始实施的政策，目标是推动其地区霸权。	Likewise, by committing itself to the Palestinian “Islamic Resistance Forces,” Hezbollah’s patron, Iran, is simply recycling a policy that it has pursued since long before that declaration, with the goal of advancing its regional hegemonic designs.
这部分解释了为什么政治制度日益僵化有时使得改革难以实行，它还能够解释包括明确改革计划的马克龙的观点为什么对法国而言有着如此非同寻常的意义。	This partly explains why the political system becomes gridlocked, sometimes making reforms difficult to implement, and why Macron’s message, which includes clear reform plans, is so unusual for France.
普京喜爱的哲学家队伍鱼龙混杂，其中既包括将俄罗斯视为以东正教信仰为基础的精神社会的神秘民族主义者，也包括形形色色无法形成连贯意识的晦涩思维。	Putin’s favorite philosophers are a mixed bag of mystical nationalists who all conceived of Russia as a spiritual community based on the Orthodox faith, but whose ideas are too diverse in other ways, and too obscure, to provide a coherent ideology.
人人都记得20世纪60年代发生在美国的华特暴动、纽华克暴动和底特律暴动，以及20世纪80年代初发生在英国的利物浦暴动，还有近年来发生的布拉德福、奥海姆和伯恩利暴动。	Everyone remembers the Watts, Newark, and Detroit riots in the United States in the 1960’s, and the riots in Liverpool in the UK in the early 1980’s, as well as in Bradford, Oldham, and Burnley in recent years.
此外，由于欧洲央行的债券购买承诺包括了一个非正式的价格目标，因此外国资本外流 — — 至少是从主权债券市场上的外流+ — — 可以自动、完全地被欧洲央行的现金代替。	And, to the extent that there is even an informal price target associated with the ECB’s commitment to purchase bonds, foreign outflows, at least from the sovereign-bond market, are automatically replaced, in full, with ECB cash.
限制抗生素使用、监管食品和药品行业、改变人类行为的努力 — — 即当前正在讨论的所有策略 — — 都需要复杂的伦理考量和分析。	Any effort to restrict antibiotic consumption, regulate the food and pharmaceutical industries, or change human behaviors – all strategies that are currently being discussed – will require complex ethical reflection and analysis.
此外，二战后建立的那些国际组织似乎也不足以应付当今全球经济面临的新挑战，并因此在一定程度上失去了其存在合理性。	In addition, the institutions created in the days following WWII no longer seem effective enough to meet the new challenges of the global economy, and thus have lost some of their legitimacy.
但是，一年多来，经济基本面逐渐不利于新兴市场（特别是不利于大宗商品）而有利于美国，因此这场调整应该在预料之内。	But, more than a year after the economic fundamentals swung against emerging markets (and especially away from commodities) and toward the United States, this adjustment was due.
右派方面，沙龙从中退出创立前进党的利库德集团在选举中遭到惨败，部分原因是很多保守派选民也弃之而去，把票投给了宗教、移民和其它政党。	On the right, the Likud party, which Sharon abandoned to establish Kadima, did very poorly, partly because many conservative voters also deserted it for religious, immigrant, and other parties.
相反，民族主义和集权主义政权统治了过去四分之一世纪中的大部分时间，追求只能保证低迷经济表现的国家资本主义增长模式。	Instead, nationalist and authoritarian regimes have been in power for most of the past quarter-century, pursuing state-capitalist growth models that ensure only mediocre economic performance.
她们写道 ： “ 有大量的证据表明发展中国家低技能劳动者的状况总体并未改善，或至少并未获得与高技能高教育水平劳动者同样的改善 。 ”	“There is overwhelming evidence,” they write, “that less-skilled workers in developing countries “are generally not better off, at least not relative to workers with higher skill or education levels.”
马克里已经宣布2017年为“可再生能源年 ” ， 承诺阿根廷将兑现2025年20%的电力需求通过可再生能源满足的目标。	Macri has declared 2017 to be the “year of renewable energy,” and committed Argentina to meeting 20% of its electricity demand with renewable energy by 2025.
1976年以来，联邦研发支出实际下降了GDP的一个百分点 — — 今年就从1.2%下降到0.7 % 。	Since 1976, federal spending on R&D has actually declined as a percentage of GDP – from 1.2% to just 0.7% this year.
金融时报报道援引委内瑞拉国民大会的说法 ， “ 长达17年的查韦斯主义见证了超过4250亿公共资金被浪费或盗用 。 ”	The Financial Times reports that, according to the Venezuelan National Assembly, “17 years of chavismo have seen more than $425 billion of public money stolen or wasted.”
如果方济各华雷斯弥撒中只关注未注册移民，那么他的话将陷入关于美国安全问题和国家保护边境的主权权利的争论。	If Francis focuses only on undocumented immigration in his Juárez address, his message is likely to become bogged down in a debate about US security concerns and countries’ sovereign right to protect their borders.
而正如美国最近这次僵局所体现的那样，在对外部债务融资的需要增加的情况下，拥有有效否决权的政治上少数派可以在经济不景时滥用法定债务上限。	And, as the recent impasse in the US demonstrates, political minorities with effective veto power can abuse statutory ceilings in an economic downturn, when dependence on external debt finance increases.
但他们的仇视被导向贫穷的墨西哥移民、黑人或中东难民，他们被视为不速之客，抢走了诚（白）实（人）美国人在社会等级中应有的位次。	But their xenophobia is directed against poor Mexican immigrants, blacks, or Middle Eastern refugees, who are perceived as freeloaders depriving honest (read white) Americans of their rightful place in the social pecking order.
他在制定新的五年计划（十二五）中起到了重要作用，该计划强调城市化以及服务业的发展以提高个人收入和消费支出在GDP中所占的比例。	Liu played an important role in shaping the recently adopted 12th Five-Year Plan, with its emphasis on urbanization and service-sector development as a means to increase personal incomes and the share of consumer spending in GDP.
如此，企业不但可以逐渐改善生产率、竞争力和企业绩效，还将有助于减少伴随边缘化、绝望和疏离而生的暴力。	Doing so would not only improve productivity, competitiveness, and business results over time. It would also help to reduce the violence that accompanies marginalization, hopelessness, and alienation.
国际教育融资便利 — — 目前已经获得世界银行、地区开发银行、GPE、ECW和众多联合国机构的支持 — — 是最好的实现方法之一。	The International Finance Facility for Education – which is already backed by the World Bank, regional development banks, GPE, ECW, and numerous UN agencies – is among the best ways to make that happen.
英国退出将使其他国家更容易坚持自己的特殊豁免权 — — 比如免受马斯特里赫特条约中的赤字和债务“要求”约束 — — 这可能给欧盟的未来发展造成严重问题。	By making it easier for other countries to insist on their own special exceptions – for example, to the deficit and debt “requirements” established in the Maastricht Treaty – Brexit could pose serious problems for the EU’s future evolution.
11月，土耳其军方在其与叙利亚边境附近击落一架俄罗斯战机，随后普京采取了一系列措施从内部动摇土耳其。	After Turkish forces shot down a Russian warplane near its border with Syria in November, Putin adopted a series of measures designed to destabilize Turkey from within.
最后。 地方机构、非政府组织和地方社区必须动员起来 — — 比如通过宣传利用非常规水资源的潜在好处的公共活动实现。	Finally, local institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and local communities must be mobilized – for example, through public campaigns showcasing the benefits of harnessing the potential of unconventional water resources.
原告声称有巨额资金被输送到三人心仪的候选人身上以帮助其进行1990年的议会大选，当时谢里夫的政党以极大优势击败了贝布托的人民党。	The plaintiff alleged that large amounts of funds were channeled to the troika’s favored candidates to contest the 1990 general election, in which Nawaz Sharif’s party won a big victory over Benazir Bhutto’s Peoples’ Party.
这样的做法会制造新的威胁，这些威胁不仅针对乌克兰，还将针对波兰、捷克共和国、匈牙利、斯洛伐克、斯洛文尼亚和其它三个波罗的海国家。	That is a recipe for renewed threats, not only to Ukraine, but to EU members like Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the three Baltic states.
我们不仅没有改变经济体系使之适应地球的自然限度，反而重新定义自然以使其适应我们的经济系统 — — 并且在这个过程中排除了其他形式的知识和真正的选项。	Instead of changing our economic system to make it fit within the planet’s natural limits, we are redefining nature so that it fits within our economic system – and, in the process, precluding other forms of knowledge and real alternatives.
特朗普迄今为止让美国富豪非常满意，承诺难以承受的税收减免，同时用驱逐非法移民的行政命令吸引其白人工薪阶层追随者，并禁止以穆斯林为主的国家移民抵达美国。	Trump has so far kept America’s plutocrats happy, through promises of unaffordable tax cuts, while mesmerizing his white working-class followers with executive orders to deport illegal immigrants and bar arrivals from Muslim-majority countries.
欧洲的领导人应该在欧洲与俄罗斯的利益重合或者不同的地方进行坦诚的讨论，并且这些讨论也应该把既是生产者又是中转国家的地区邻国包括进来，就像我的祖国乌克兰。	Europe’s leaders should engage in frank discussions about where European and Russian interests converge or differ, and these discussions should include regional neighbors that are both producer and transit nations, like my own country, Ukraine.
英国皇家学会认为，对这一技术的需求是不可避免的，并且已开始与其他国家的同道一起探索如何治理该技术的使用。	The United Kingdom’s Royal Society believes that the need for such technology may be unavoidable, and it has been working with counterparts in other countries to explore ways in which its use should be governed.
但即使创新不大大减速，或很快再次起势，抓住由此带来的生产率进步所需要的结构调整和行为变化也得消耗时间。	But even if innovation has not dropped off too much, or picks up again soon, the structural adaptation and behavioral changes needed to take advantage of the concomitant productivity gains will take time.
来自不同领域的专家意见 — — 分子和细胞生物学、数学和统计学、营养和饮食、食品化学和社会科学 — — 对营养基因学的发展非常重要。	Expertise in a wide variety of different areas – molecular and cell biology, mathematics and statistics, nutrition and diet, food chemistry, and social science – is fundamental to progress.
因为日本的名义GDP现在接近500万亿日元，所以GNI和GDP两者之间1.7个百分点的差额相当于8.5万亿日元。	Because Japan’s nominal GDP is now close to ¥500 trillion yen, the 1.7-percentage-point difference between GNI and GDP amounts to ¥8.5 trillion.
很多什叶派坚持最后的萨达姆精英残余必须清除，但很多逊尼人认为阻止他们获取好职位和政治影响力才是行动的真正目的。	Many Shia insist that the last vestiges of Saddam’s elite must be purged, but many Sunnis argue that the process is intended to bar them from good jobs and political influence.
乌克兰人向欧盟证明了他们的忠诚，而欧盟自身也正处于令人绝望的分裂中，欧元危机让债权国和债务国势不两立。	Ukrainians have demonstrated their allegiance to a European Union that is itself hopelessly divided, with the euro crisis pitting creditor and debtor countries against one another.
正如已故大阿亚图拉阿里·蒙塔泽里所说，这个政权对其民众的残暴行径已经使之陷入了“既违反了伊斯兰教义，也不像个共和国”的境地。	As the late Grand Ayatollah Ali Montazeri put it, the regime’s brutality towards its own people has rendered it “neither Islamic nor a Republic.”
另外，美国的反应也��化了以色列对军事解决方式有效性的信心，从而导致了最近的黎巴嫩战争和对加沙的入侵。	Moreover, the US response has strengthened Israel’s belief in the effectiveness of military methods, leading to the recent war in Lebanon and the ongoing invasion of Gaza.
一旦华人承认了自己新来者的身份，他们就不得不接受这样一个事实：即成为这个新国家的完全国民是必须通过争取才能得到的地位。	Once the Chinese recognized their place as newcomers, they had to accept that becoming full nationals of the new nation state was a status that needed to be earned.
因为各方于2013年11月达成的联合行动计划虽然解决了西方国家近乎所有的核疑虑，但却没有指明伊朗实现正常化的必要途径。	This is because the Joint Plan of Action to which the parties agreed in November 2013, while addressing virtually all of the West’s immediate nuclear concerns, does not map out the necessary pathway to Iran’s normalization.
桑德斯所提出的全面方案 — — 单一出资者的医疗体系和免费公立大学 — — 不论如何不切实际，总归大受欢迎，特别是年轻人压倒性地支持他而不是克林顿。	The sweeping programs Sanders is pushing – a single-payer health-care system and free tuition at public colleges – however impracticable, are popular, especially among younger people, who overwhelmingly favor him over Clinton.
如果美国能源进口量有所减少，那么从长期看它的脆弱性将会减小，但石油是一种可替代商品，而美国经济仍然对世界油价的突然变化所带来的冲击非常敏感。	The US may be less vulnerable in the long run if it imports less energy, but oil is a fungible commodity, and the US economy will remain sensitive to shocks from sudden changes in world prices.
但是，在日本与中国的紧张关系占据了全球媒体焦点的同时，中国和印度之间的战略对峙才更有可能决定未来几十年中的亚洲实力动态。	But, while Japan’s tense relationship with China dominates headlines worldwide, the strategic rivalry between China and India is more likely to shape Asian power dynamics in the coming decades.
这一挑战在拉美和加勒比地区尤为严峻，那里许多国家的人均国内生产总值都大幅提高，但仍然无法摆脱结构性障碍和重大弱点实现长期繁荣。	This challenge is particularly acute in Latin America and the Caribbean, where many countries have achieved greater GDP per capita, but still face significant vulnerabilities and structural obstacles to long-term prosperity.
但泰国的态度也正在发生转变，尤其在一对澳大利亚夫妇拒绝为一名被确诊患有唐氏综合症的代孕婴儿负责的事件发生后。	But there, too, attitudes have been shifting, especially after an Australian couple refused to take responsibility for a baby born through surrogacy who was diagnosed with Down Syndrome.
沙特阿拉伯、土耳其、卡塔尔以及美国时不时支持某些最暴力的圣战组织，犬儒主义地错误地计划让这些代理人替它们干脏活，然后再把他们踢出局。	Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and the US have regularly backed some of the most violent jihadist groups in a cynical miscalculation that these proxies would do their dirty work and then somehow be pushed aside.
他抱怨说，美国已经拿出了超过10亿美元，而没有向美国和全世界人民解释10亿美元相当于每个美国人拿出了3.08美元。	He complains that the US has already given over $1 billion, without explaining to the American people and the world that $1 billion is a contribution of $3.08 per American.

短期因素 — — 如政治动荡、与气候有关的干扰和投机行为 — — 虽然也是价格的重要决定因素，但只是部分因素。	While short-term factors – for example, political instability, weather-related disruptions, and speculative activity – are important determinants of prices, they tell only part of the story.
在大企业中组织研发可能比试图在初创企业创造出复杂的生态系统要容易得多（这或许是大企业在历史上一直优于初创企业的理由 ） 。	Organizing research and development within a large corporation may be much less challenging than trying to generate the complex ecosystem that a start-up approach would require (which may be why the first preceded the second historically).
2008年后的复苏已经放缓，有些观察员甚至担心欧洲爆发的金融问题将令美国和世界经济陷入二次衰退之中。	Its post-2008 recovery has slowed, and some observers fear that Europe’s financial problems could tip the American and world economy into a second recession.
如果要在经济上取得成功的话，他们还需要西方的支持 — — 而西方显然不会资助那些伊斯兰极端主义政府。	To succeed economically, they will need Western support – and the West will not be eager to fund radical Islamist governments.
总体而言，虽然存在差异，但这些研究结果并不能有力支持那种用对自由市场或威权的深层次态度差异来简单解释最近事件的观点。	Overall, while there are differences, the results do not lend strong support to the idea that recent events have a simple explanation in terms of differences in deep attitudes toward free markets or authoritarianism.
实际上，全方位的“社会”建设在1868年明治维新之后才真正开始，从而导致权力的天平彻底地向国家方向倾斜。	Indeed, full-fledged “society”-building started only after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, which tipped the balance of power definitively in favor of the state.
莫拉莱斯是否会行使政府的合法权力，重新谈判有关玻利维亚天然气矿藏管理的法律和合同，但又不把国家急需的外资吓跑？	Will Morales renegotiate the laws and contracts governing Bolivia’s vast natural gas reserves, as his government is rightly committed to do, in a way that does not scare away urgently needed foreign investment?
巴格达—最近，伊拉克举行了自2011年美军撤离后的第一次议会选举。 这次选举是在暴力活动不断升级、直指2005—2007年动乱程度的情况下举行的。	BAGHDAD – Iraq’s recent parliamentary election, the first since United States troops left the country in 2011, was held amid a rising tide of violence that is fast approaching the levels experienced during the 2005-2007 insurgency.
即使有些机构将碳密集型企业清除出了自身投资组合，它们也会普遍认为投资新清洁能源基础设施项目（尤其是在新兴市场）风险过高。	Even as some purge their portfolios of carbon-intensive companies, they generally consider investing in new clean-energy infrastructure projects to be too risky, particularly in emerging markets.
ESA还需要更多地资金，资金源可以是向金融企业课费。 同时还应该考虑将各ESA合并成一家并迁往布鲁塞尔。	The ESAs also need more money, which probably can come from fees levied on financial firms, and consideration should be given to merging them in a single location, presumably Brussels.
获胜的什叶派联盟追随着被形容为一个温和伊斯兰教主义者的西斯塔尼（Ayatollah Ali Sistani ） ， 但是该联盟的多数成员却是极端主义分子。	The victorious coalition follows Ayatollah Ali Sistani, who can be described as a moderate Islamist, but many of its members are extreme.
尽管特朗普似乎在选战期间表明他将完成上述所有动作，但如果他做出将摧毁全球秩序的决定，也难免会面临影响深远的后果。	Though Trump seemed to suggest during the campaign that he would do all of these things, he will inevitably be confronted with the far-reaching consequences of decisions that would destroy the global order.
当福克斯新闻的比尔·奥雷利最近指责安妮斯顿拍摄的一部描绘单身母亲的影片 — — 播种爱情 — — 似乎在对十二三岁的女孩子们说 ， ‘ 你们不需要男人’时，他其实是对的。	When Bill O’Reilly of Fox News recently accused Aniston of making a movie about single motherhood – The Switch – that seems to say “to a twelve or thirteen year old girl, ‘You don’t need a man,’” he is right.
发自纽黑文 — — 全球最庞大的两个经济体 — — 美国和中国 — — 最终似乎开始走上一条通向政策正常化的道路，这可不会是一件容易的事。	NEW HAVEN – It was never going to be easy, but central banks in the world’s two largest economies – the United States and China – finally appear to be embarking on a path to policy normalization.
莫顿发现，当地影响人士说起他们的小镇非常亲切，仿佛那是一个独特又特别的地方，他们通常会说自己再也不想离开。	The local influentials, Merton discovered, spoke affectionately of their town, as if it were a unique and special place, and often said they would never leave.
而奥巴马医改所采用的方案是当年由美国传统基金会这类保守智库所提议，并由时任州长的共和党人米特·罗姆尼在马萨诸塞州推广应用。	The approach taken by Obamacare was proposed in conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and enacted in Massachusetts by Republican Governor Mitt Romney.
前一任噶玛巴于1981年圆寂，对于其继任者的争议自那以后就一直持续，同时也反映出各方对噶举派 — — 藏传佛教中最富有的教派 — — 15亿美元资产的争夺。	The previous Karmapa Lama died in 1981, and the controversy over his successor that has raged ever since also epitomizes a struggle for control of the $1.5 billion in assets held by the Kagyu order, the richest in Tibetan Buddhism.
与此同时，许多美国凯恩斯主义经济学家，如诺贝尔经济学奖获得者保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）和约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz ） ， 表示同情希腊的反紧缩立场。	Meanwhile, many of North America’s Keynesian economists, such as Nobel laureates Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, sympathize with Greece’s anti-austerity stance.
结果可能是工资提高，形成更多新岗位 — — 全世界范围内高达3—3.65亿个 — — 原因在于支出增加，其中新兴经济体获益最多。	The result could be higher wages that contribute to the creation of more new jobs – 300-365 million worldwide – as spending increases, with emerging economies gaining the most.
南斯拉夫 — — 威尔逊主义外交政策的拙劣产物 — — 所发生的事情可能中东更加互相怀疑的诸帝国间重演。	What happened in Yugoslavia, an ill-conceived product of Wilsonian diplomacy, could happen in the more cynical imperial creations in the Middle East.
而这些转型如何展开不仅事关巴基斯坦人自身，还将影响到穆斯林世界中的大部分人，尤其是在阿拉伯之春令大中东地区的许多政府都发生了更替的情况下。	How they unfold matters not only for Pakistan, but also for much of the Muslim world, particularly as the Arab Spring forces change upon governments across the wider Middle East.
但如果他们继续沿现在的道路走下去，他们就可能最终面临国内社会政治矛盾爆发的局面 — — 同时加剧在国外的冲突。	But if they continue on their current path, they may end up facing sociopolitical explosions at home – and deepening conflicts abroad.
赫尔辛基则有可能面临更糟的局面，因为在普京和特朗普长达两小时的一对一会面中，根本没有对讨论、更不要说协议内容的任何书面记录。	Helsinki has the potential to be even worse, as there is no written record of what, if anything, was discussed, much less agreed, during Putin and Trump’s two-hour, one-on-one discussion.
发自伦敦 — — 本周美国总统特朗普与中国国家主席习近平在布宜诺斯艾利斯G20峰会上的会晤被视为事关世界经济和金融市场存亡的时刻。	LONDON – The meeting between US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires this week is being viewed as a make-or-break moment for the world economy and financial markets.
在选举之前的欧佩克会议上，欧佩克主要生产国沙特阿拉伯拒绝采取限制石油产量以阻止全球油价快速下跌的计划，放任油价继续下滑。	At an OPEC meeting in the run-up to the election, the group’s dominant producer, Saudi Arabia, shelved plans to restrict oil production to counteract the rapid decline in world prices, allowing them to continue to fall.
奥巴马在2008年大选过程中以及总统生涯的前几个月里的口号在形式上颇为鼓舞人心，在目标上则相当具有变革性。	Obama’s rhetoric during his 2008 campaign and the first months of his presidency was both inspirational in style and transformational in objective.
而当今，科学研究却在几乎所有的欧洲国家（瑞典、芬兰和冰岛除外）呈衰退之势。 现有人才被浪费，对年轻人的吸引力不断丧失。	Today, however, European science is declining in almost all countries (Sweden, Finland, and Iceland are exceptions), wasting existing talent and losing attractiveness for young people.
当年在西方战略利益的口号下，这些人被有计划地驱逐出自己的家园，整个过程堪称一场人间惨剧，而如今西方可以，也应当让他们重回故土。	The way in which the inhabitants of this archipelago were systematically dispossessed and thrown off their land in the name of Western strategic interests is a human tragedy for which the West can and should make restitution.
这是有点出人意料，因为这些完全开放资本账户的经济体本应从资本的自由流动和国际风险分担中获益 — — 并因此只会经历小范围的宏观经济波动。	This is surprising, because, as developed economies with fully open capital accounts, they should have benefited from the free flow of capital and international risk sharing – and thus experienced little macroeconomic volatility.
Paul Salem 认为，对于那些正在寻找一部可以调和国内什叶派、逊尼派、库尔德人和土库曼人争端的宪法的伊拉克人，黎巴嫩也许能为他们提供导向。	Lebanon, argues Paul Salem, may provide a guide for those Iraqis who seek a constitution that can reconcile the country’s Shi-ite, Sunni, Kurdish and Turkmen communities.
欧洲国家极右翼选民最大的仇恨就是针对政治精英们。 在许多人眼里，这些政治精英在舒服的联合政府中执政时间过长，而这些政府看起来主要就是为了保护既得利益。	The biggest resentment among right-wing voters in European countries is reserved for political elites, who, in the opinion of many, have been governing for too long in cozy coalitions, which appear to exist chiefly to protect vested interests.
目前的状况是，数字供应链安全远非密不透风，最近有报告显示企业在其采购的服务器主板上发现了神秘的芯片，似乎是在制造时加上去的。	Already, digital supply-chain security is far from airtight, reflected in recent reports of companies finding mysterious chips on their server motherboards, seemingly added at the time of manufacture.

除了带来重要的但政治上被边缘化的群体，这样的一个委员会也可能产生示范效应，成功地在小范围内分享权力，可能��励更大范围内的权力分享。	Beyond bringing important but politically marginalized groups to the table, such a committee might also produce a demonstration effect, with successful power-sharing in a small setting possibly encouraging power-sharing writ large.
在经历了一年的对峙之后，中国最近同意与韩国实现关系正常化这可能就是习近平摆脱了接班人政治的效果的反映。	China’s recent agreement to normalize relations with South Korea, after more than a year of acrimony, may reflect the effect of Xi’s liberation from succession politics.
从现实政治的角度来看，普京对乌克兰的干预是一个灾难性的错误：除了遭受经济制裁外，俄罗斯的政策最终地令乌克兰倒向西方阵营。	From the perspective of Realpolitik, Putin’s intervention in Ukraine was a catastrophic error: in addition to the economic sanctions Russia incurred as a result, Russian policy shifted Ukraine decisively into the Western camp.
在股权受控的公司，投资者担心的问题是小投资者的分散，而让董事更加响应控股股东的要求，可能使小投资者的利益更加容易受到损害。	In controlled firms, where the concern is diversion from minority shareholders, making directors even more responsive to the controller will likely make minority investors still more vulnerable.
它强调政策试验和目标范围相对狭窄的尝试以发现适合当地的解决方法而不是详尽的改革，并且它提倡检测和评估，以了解哪一个试验有效。	Rather than comprehensive reform, it emphasizes policy experimentation and relatively narrowly targeted initiatives in order to discover local solutions, and it calls for monitoring and evaluation in order to learn which experiments work.
今天诋毁奥巴马对俄罗斯普京最近吞并乌克兰林土的行为采取谨慎反应的人也不会因为布什在2008年对普京入侵格鲁吉亚反应不够强硬而称其为孤立主义者。	Nor did those who now disparage Obama’s measured response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent annexation of Ukrainian territory call Bush an isolationist for his weak response to Putin’s invasion of Georgia in 2008.
他们中有艺术家和演员，也有商人和银行家。 从某种程度上讲，这并不是难以解释的现象；像纽约市这样的大都市有着文化多样化的人口、跨国公司和各种天才个体，遍地都是机会。	In a sense, this is not a difficult phenomenon to explain; metropolises like New York City, with their multicultural populations, multinational corporations, and multitude of talented individuals, are rife with opportunities.
“我们正在切身感受到气候变化急剧扩大的影响 ， ” 印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪在谈到钦奈洪灾时说，并呼吁工业化国家采取更多措施缓解全球变暖的影响。	“We are feeling climate change’s fast-growing impact now,” said India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pointing to Chennai and calling upon industrialized countries to do more to mitigate global warming.
人类事务变得越来越复杂，对道德的要求越来越严苛，因此我们的子孙后代将需要科学和人文学习的双管齐下 — — 比此前任何时候都需要。	As human affairs become increasingly complex and morally exigent, future generations will need both scientific and humanistic learning – and they will need them more than ever.
但据MIT生活工资计算器，弗雷斯诺的双薪单孩家庭的工人每小时至少需要赚到14美元才能覆盖基本需求；旧金山工人则需要21美元。	Yet, according to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, a worker in a dual-income, single-child household in Fresno needs to earn at least $14 per hour to cover its basic needs; in San Francisco, that same worker must make at least $21 per hour.
在欧洲，建立一个和平的准联邦联盟经历了两次世界大战和通过种族清洗重画国家界线的历史 — — 并且至今仍在面对排外主义和民族主义运动的挑战。	For Europe, creating a peaceful, quasi-federal union required two world wars and the redrawing of national boundaries through ethnic cleansing – and it continues to be challenged by xenophobic and nationalist movements.
这出于诸多理由而成为理想对策，包括摧毁文化遗址和奴役并杀戮无辜男人、女人和儿童的刽子手需要依靠出售掠夺来的财富才能获得所需的资源。	This is desirable for many reasons, including the fact that those who destroy cultural sites, and enslave and kill innocent men, women, and children, acquire the resources they need in part from the sale of looted treasures.
选民得到的承诺是与（英国最大的市场）欧洲签订有利的贸易协议、降低移民人数，并节约资金用于国家卫生体系和其他稀缺的公共产品及服务。	Voters were promised an advantageous trade deal with Europe (Britain’s biggest market), lower immigration, and more money for the National Health Service and other cherished public goods and services.
现实告诉美国金融家纽约需要建设自身的商业交易系统，像伦敦市场那样处理汇票并实现汇票的货币化（也叫“承兑业务 ” ） 。	American financiers were persuaded that New York needed to develop its own commercial trading system to handle bills of exchange in the same way as the London market and arrange their monetization (or “acceptance”).
但是，由于台湾政治竞争或者大陆解放军越发不耐烦而可能引发的事件的危险性，美国鼓励两岸更积极的接触和谈判应该是明智的。	But, given the danger of incidents that could grow out of political competition in Taiwan or growing impatience in the Peoples’ Liberation Army on the mainland, the US would be wise to encourage more active contacts and negotiations by the two sides.
央行被迫采取远远偏离理想状态的政策路径 — — 因为它们日益可能刺激不宣而战的货币战争的一些零和要素。	Central banks have been forced onto a policy path that is far from ideal – not least because they increasingly risk inciting some of the zero-sum elements of an undeclared currency war.
虽然20世纪成功的叛乱建立起了一定程度的等级和一支政治派别，但伊拉克现今的叛乱仍然是松散而缺乏组织性的。	While successful twentieth-century insurgencies developed some degree of hierarchy and a political wing, the Iraq insurgency remains a loose, amorphous network.
虽然民主未列入他的议程，但他的言论及其追随者在国内不断制造的武装冲突毫无疑问是要瓦解当朝政权的合法性。	While democracy is not part of his agenda, his messages, as well as his followers’ periodic armed attacks inside the country, have no doubt contributed to the erosion of the regime’s legitimacy.
因此，我成立了规模1亿美元的投资公司Rewired，支持参与解决重要社会问题的初创AI和机器人企业。	That is why I established Rewired, a $100 million investment vehicle that supports embryonic AI and robotics firms engaged in addressing important social issues.
储蓄率徘徊在10－20%之间，而外债则从2005年占GDP的110%下降到2008年占GDP的21 % 。	Savings rates are between 10% and 20%, and external debt has decreased from 110% of GDP in 2005 to 21% in 2008.
实际上，两人都希望通过和平协议来达到在政治上生存下去的目的。 奥尔穆特通过新的选举，而阿巴斯通过可以取得对哈马斯优势的全民公决来达到目的。	Indeed, both men hope for political survival through a peace agreement: Olmert by means of new elections and Abbas by a referendum through which he can regain ascendancy over Hamas.
因此，左翼联盟极有可能根据希腊选举法获得关键奖励 — — 赢得选票最多的政党可以在300个席位的议会中额外获得50个席位。	As a result, Syriza stands to earn a crucial premium under Greek electoral law, according to which the party that gains the most votes is allocated an extra 50 of the parliament’s 300 seats.
欧洲和美国的领导人必须向波斯尼亚人以及其他各方传达一个信息，那就是只许胜利不许失败，并使之确信欧盟是不愿意接受那些波斯尼亚某些人试图阻挠欧盟入盟进程的人的反对意见的	European and US leaders would have to convey to the Bosnians and others that failure is not an option and convince them of the EU’s bottom-line unwillingness to accept opposition from those in Bosnia who impede the EU accession process.
传统民粹主义贸易政策 — — 比如特朗普所支持的那些 — — 在过去并没有取得过很好的效果，如今，它们的表现极有可能更加糟糕。	Traditional populist trade policies, like those that Trump has espoused, have not worked well in the past, and are likely to perform even worse now.
高度保守的游说团体司法观察（Judicial Watch）一直在鼓吹关注这一问题，施压披露克林顿没有转交国务院的邮件。	The highly conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch has continually called attention to the issue, forcing the disclosure of emails that Clinton hadn’t turned over to the State Department.
新巴塞尔III全球银行改革规则将导致某些借款人的借贷成本进一步上升，同时减弱资金的可获得性，特别是长期债务。	The new Basel III package of global banking reforms may increase funding costs further for some borrowers, while reducing the availability of finance, especially for longer-term debt.
在红细胞之外 ， “ 好”的亚铁 — — 唯一的携氧形式 — — 被不可控地氧化，形成“坏”的三价铁和“丑”的高价铁的血红蛋白形式。	Outside of red blood cells, “good” ferrous iron – the only oxygen-carrying form – is oxidized uncontrollably to form the “bad” ferric and “ugly” ferryl forms of hemoglobin.
问题产生的原因是美国长期以来的储蓄短缺问题现在已经进入了危险区，如果现在减税的话，美国将比以往更加难以为多年的赤字寻找融资。	The problem arises because America’s chronic saving shortfall has now moved into the danger zone, making it much more difficult to fund multi-year deficits today than was the case when cutting taxes in the past.
但即便调查结果准确，他究竟受欢迎与否基本上也无关紧要：独裁者统治并不通过社会契约，普京的地位及合法性也不来源于民意支持。	But, even if the polls are accurate, his popularity is largely irrelevant: dictators do not rule through a social contract, and neither his position nor his legitimacy derives from popular appeal.
如果欧洲人想要克服对放弃主权以实现政治联盟的恐惧，一种归依欧洲和欧洲机构的公民意识必须重新树立并成长起来。	If Europeans are to overcome their fear of giving up sovereignty in order to achieve political union, a civic sense of attachment to Europe and its institutions must be regained and nurtured.
而随着全球两个最大经济体同时陷入了危险的泥潭，书中列举的人类/国家两种行为体之间的相似程度令人震惊，而其预测也得到了高度契合的验证。	But the similarities are striking, and the prognosis all the more compelling, as the world’s two largest economies sink into a dangerous quagmire.
而麦肯锡公司则预计这一不断崛起的阶级将在未来十年内实现20万亿美元/年的购买力 — — 这是美国目前全国购买力水平的两倍。	Indeed, projections from McKinsey & Company suggest that the purchasing power of this rising middle class in emerging markets may rise to $20 trillion over the next decade – twice the current level of consumption in the United States.
2013年，当我决定让西雅图远离化石燃料时，我的决定受到了必须面对全球变暖后果的年轻人的热烈响应，普通大众也很支持。	When I put Seattle on the path to divestment in 2013, my decision was well received by the young people who will have to live with the consequences of global warming, as well as the general public.

麦德林贫穷社区的问题并没有被根治，但基础设施改善带来了巨大的好处 — — 在城铁站周边，整洁的房屋、壁画和足球场随处可见。 城铁只是麦德林最具代表性的工程。	The problems of the city’s poor neighborhoods have not been erased, but the benefits that the infrastructure improvements have brought are brilliantly evident in the well-kept houses, murals, and soccer fields perched near the gondola stations.
与暴躁的中国人不同，哈西娜的发言人仅仅做出了温和的反驳，否认了克林顿关于孟加拉政府涉嫌虐待尤努斯的说法。	Unlike the testy Chinese, Hasina’s spokesperson offered only a gentle rejoinder, rejecting Clinton’s suggestions about alleged mistreatment of Yunus.
很明显，他有可能赢得第一场提名竞争 — — 艾奥瓦州党代会，并且他在第二场竞争 — — 新罕布什尔州和其他州也处于领先。	It became evident that he might win the first nominating contest, the Iowa caucuses, and that he was leading in the second, New Hampshire, and other states.
中国银行监管部门已经允许债转股及其它国有资产改革试点，国际货币基金组织也说应该将这一方针纳入到加速国有企业改革的全面战略中去。	China’s bank regulators have already permitted experiments in debt-equity swaps, which the International Monetary Fund says should be incorporated in a comprehensive strategy to accelerate reform of state-owned enterprises.
超调就好像打了类固醇：一开始本币急剧大幅贬值，然后反弹，最后，以经通胀调整的标准衡量的汇率可能比一开始更强。	This is overshooting on steroids: a very sharp initial loss of value for the domestic currency, followed by a gain that may leave the exchange rate, measured in inflation-adjusted terms, stronger than it was at the start.
这个变化预示着中国外交政策在未来可能进行调整，因为“福”一词在中国传统政治思想中出现的频率要远高于马克思主义政治哲学。	This change may augur future adjustments in China’s foreign policy as well, for “happiness” is a word used more frequently in Chinese traditional political thought than in Marxist political philosophy.
而令情况更遭的则是萨拉赫最近肩部脱臼受伤，导致他缺席了利物浦对阵皇家马德里的欧洲冠军联赛决赛以及埃及对阵乌拉圭的第一场关键比赛。	This was all the more true given that Salah recently suffered a dislocated shoulder, which forced him out of Liverpool’s Champions League final against Real Madrid and sidelined him in Egypt’s first pivotal game in Russia, against Uruguay.
罗马尼亚极端主义诗人科尔内留·瓦迪姆·图多尔输给了一系列腐败的实用主义份子，上述实用分子中的第一个是领导推翻该国最后一名共产党领导人齐奥塞斯库的伊利埃斯库。	In Romania, the extremist poet Corneliu Vadim Tudor lost to a succession of corrupt pragmatists, beginning with Ion Iliescu, who had led the ouster of the country’s last communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu.
而目前全世界所需要的生态革命 — — 向低碳经济和低碳生活方式的转变 — — 也需要这么一种综合性的变革。	The ecological revolution that the world demands today – a transition to a low-carbon global economy and a low-carbon way of daily life – will require a similarly comprehensive change.
发展中国家在这一进程中已经落后，但是，随着全球变暖的共��威胁，现在采纳保护环境政策的压力越来越大。	Developing countries have lagged behind in this process, but, with the common threat of global warming, there is now growing pressure to adopt conservation policies.
在智利，这项原则容许政府逐步偿还债务，并最终在将自身改造为净债权国的同时降低公共投资和产出的波动幅度。	In Chile, the rule allowed the government to pay back debt gradually and eventually turn itself into a net creditor, while at the same time reducing the volatility of public investment and output.
相反，如果他在没有明确改革授权的情况下射出供应结构改革这安倍经济战略重振日本经济的第三支“箭”才是真正的不计后果。	On the contrary, he would have been reckless to launch the third “arrow” of his so-called Abenomics strategy for reviving Japan’s economy – supply-side structural reforms – without a clear mandate for reform.
特别是要专门针对俄罗斯去制定一个更为成熟严密的政策：比如说当我们对俄罗斯试图重建前苏联“利益圈”和“防御区”的政策感到不满时，中欧人就应该把自己定义为俄罗斯人的对手。	For example, we Central Europeans are opponents when we do not accept Russia’s policy of renewing “spheres of interest” and “security zones.”
如果中国花力气驯服它的保护对象朝鲜，那么韩国所受到的威胁 — — 从而韩国对先进导弹防御盾的需要 — — 就不那么强烈。	If China devoted its energy to reining in its North Korean client, the threat confronting South Korea – and thus the South’s need for an advanced missile shield – might be mitigated.
它巩固了其印度洋与太平洋之间的战略通道。 这条同道贡献了全球海路贸易的三分之一 — — 去年价值高达5.3万亿美元。	It has consolidated its control over the strategic corridor between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, through which one-third of global maritime trade – worth $5.3 trillion last year – passes.
全世界1/3的独角兽企业（估值超过10亿美元的创业公司）都来自中国，同时，中国科技企业的运算效率依然保持着世界纪录。	One in three of the world’s unicorns (start-ups valued at more than $1 billion) is Chinese, and the country’s cloud providers hold the world record for computing efficiency.
如果英国脱离欧盟，美国的最紧密盟友将被边缘化 … … 并且整个欧洲工程也可能分崩离析，而与此同时，西方正在面临新的经济和安全威胁 。 ”	If Britain leaves the EU, America’s closest ally would be marginalized….and the whole European project at risk of unraveling at precisely the time new economic and security threats confront the West.”
他们当然会考虑到如果支持在未经过相关司法程序的情况下对外国公民进行无限期拘押会使自己成为国际司法界被人诟病的对象。	It cannot have escaped their notice that to uphold indefinite detention of foreign nationals without judicial process would have made them virtual pariahs on the conference circuit.
但如今再通胀可能在制造资产价格泡沫，而从目前看，寄希望于宏观审慎政策能够阻止泡沫破裂还只是一种“情怀 ” 。	But now reflation may be creating asset-price bubbles, and the hope that macro-prudential policies will prevent them from bursting is so far just that – a leap of faith.
玛沙尔同时还给予阿巴斯一年的授权去和以色列谈判，还与哈尼耶背道而驰，支持最近在约旦进行的以巴“探索性谈话 ” 。	Mashal also offered Abbas a one-year mandate for negotiations with Israel, and, unlike Haniyeh, supported recent Israeli-Palestinian “exploratory talks” in Jordan.
除开所有这些情况，非银行金融机构的金融体系也面临着阴影，它们像银行一样，借来短期和流动资金然而借给或者投资在长期和非流动的资产上。	On top of all this, there is a shadow financial system of non-bank financial institutions that, like banks, borrow short and liquid and lend to or invest in longer-term and illiquid assets.
报告也首次对那些可能威胁美国安全的人员下了精确定义 — — 美国并不是在打一场反对恐怖主义的战争，而是在“对抗一个特殊的网络，那就是基地组织及其分支 ” 。	For the first time, precise reference is made to people liable to be a threat to US security. The US is not waging a war against terrorism; it is at “war against a specific network, al Qaida, and its affiliates.”
上述这些趋势令低技能工人的工资和就业在劳动力短缺但资本充足的发达经济体和劳动力充裕的新兴经济体中此消彼长。	All of these trends reduce wages and employment for low-skill workers in labor-scarce and capital-rich advanced economies, and raise them in labor-abundant emerging economies.
几年前，美国降低了资本收入的联邦税，并逐步取消了房地产遗产税，这只能让最顶层1%获益 — — 被广泛视为富人炫耀政治权力。	A few years ago, the US reduced federal taxes on capital income and phased out the estate tax, benefiting only the upper 1% – moves widely viewed as demonstrating the political power of the rich.
从最乐观的角度看，历史的自然进程也只是“点滴”进步，但技术变革的日新月异让我们期望人事也能快速进展。	The natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress “at the margin,” but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid progress in human affairs.
一座位于市区30里外的500兆瓦反应堆一旦发生熔毁将导致4.5万人迅速死亡，7万人受伤，经济损失170亿元。	The meltdown of a 500-megawatt reactor located 30 miles from a city would cause the immediate death of an estimated 45,000 people, injure roughly another 70,000, and cause $17 billion in property damage.
阿拉法特管理着一群混乱不堪的竞争对手，这不仅威胁到其它潜在领袖的地位，也确保了一切权力（和资金）都由阿拉法特本人亲自管理。	Arafat presided over a sort of anarchy, encouraging rivalries, undermining other potential leaders, and ensuring that all authority (and money) ran through his hands.
沃尔芬森认为腐败是发展进程的组成部分，又向前迈出了有价值的一步，因为过去在某些官僚圈子里，即使提一下“腐败”这个词似乎都是很忌讳的。	Wolfensohn’s insistence that corruption be confronted as part of the development process was another valuable step forward. It used to be that even mentioning corruption in some official circles was considered taboo.
此外，如果我们希望欧盟经历危机后更加强大，欧盟还必须在财政紧缩和促增长的政策之间实现更好的平衡，因为没有经济增长和较高的就业率，欧元区的问题就无法解决。	Moreover, if we want the EU to emerge strengthened from the crisis, it must also strike a better balance between austerity and pro-growth policies, because, without growth and higher employment, the eurozone’s problems cannot be resolved.
（从理论上讲，在劳动力丰富的中国和印度，资本家可能成为输家。 但在现实中，由于其政府成功的同步自由化和全球化，他们也受益匪浅。	(In theory, capitalists in labor-abundant China and India could end up as losers, but in practice they, too, have benefited thanks to their governments’ success in simultaneously liberalizing and globalizing.)
这导致了流向欧元区南部成员国的资本流突然断流，迫使这些国家的经常项目从五年前的3000亿美元赤字（总和）转变为如今的略有盈余。	This was a consequence of the sudden stop of capital flows to the eurozone’s southern members, which forced these countries to turn their current accounts from a combined deficit of $300 billion five years ago to a small surplus today.
也有人回到祖国 — — 包括埃及、菲律宾等 — — 发动针对被他们视为受到西方毒害的政府的恐怖行动。	Others returned to their home countries – from Egypt to the Philippines – to wage terror campaigns against what they viewed as Western-tainted governments.
和大部分贸易品一样，石油出口用美元支付 — — 主要是通过位于比利时的世界银行间通讯协会（SWIFT）进行 — — 美国有权力切断这些交易。	Like most traded goods, oil exports are paid for in dollars – largely through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) in Belgium – and the US has the power to shut down such transactions.
当前保守主义周期的危机反映了在次级抵押贷款危机下变得明显的巨额坏账积累的事实，该次贷危机始于2007年6月，现在已经扩散到整个信贷市场，并使雷曼兄弟陷入破产境地。	The current crisis of the conservative cycle reflects the massive build-up of bad debt that became apparent with the sub-prime crisis, which started in June 2007 and has now spread to the whole credit market, sinking Lehman Brothers.
类似地，经合组织透明度和税收目的信息交流论坛（OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes）正在领导一套关于法律框架和标准实施的全面同行评议过程。	Similarly, the OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes is leading an extensive peer-review process of legal frameworks and implementation of standards.
他们必须越来越多地在同行评议杂志上发表作品，才能攀登职业阶梯、保住工作岗位和为所在机构争取研究经费。	They must publish their work in peer-reviewed journals increasingly often to climb the career ladder, protect their jobs, and secure funding for their institutions.
如果你问大部分加泰罗尼亚人，除了摆脱西班牙独立还能带来什么，你不会听到多少答案：对历史错误的仇恨压倒了任何对未来的认真算计。	Ask most Catalans what independence will bring, aside from freedom from Spain, and you won’t get much of an answer: resentment at past wrongs overshadows any serious calculations about the future.
悲哀的是，所有这些高层次投资人似乎都没有反对Reddit放任“WhiteNationalism ” （ 白人民族主义 ） 、 “rapeisfun ” （ 强奸真爽 ） 、 “BurningKids ” （ 烧死儿童 ） 、 “cutefemalecorpses ” （ 可爱的女尸）等版面大行其道。	Sadly, none of these high-profile investors seems to have objected to Reddit’s hosting of subreddits called “WhiteNationalism,” “rapeisfun,” “BurningKids,” “cutefemalecorpses,” and so on.
从1996年到2010年，德国单位劳动力成本仅上升8 ％ ， 法国上升13 ％ ， 而葡萄牙上升24 % ， 西班牙上升35 ％ ， 意大利上升37 ％ ， 希腊上升则高达59 ％ 。	From 1996 to 2010, unit labor costs in Germany increased by just 8%, and by 13% in France. Compare that to 24% in Portugal, 35% in Spain, 37% in Italy, and a whopping 59% in Greece.
政府债券价格的下跌暴露出银行的资本不足问题，而政府不得不为银行资本重组提供资金的前景又推高了政府债券的风险溢价。	The decline in government bond prices has exposed the banks’ undercapitalization, while the prospect that governments will have to finance banks’ recapitalization has driven up risk premiums on government bonds.
债权人的坚持表明，欧元区决策者 — — 特别是德国人 — — 死守着一个概念框架，这个框架导致他们一直低估了情况的严重性、要求采取让情况雪上加霜的政策。	That insistence reflects the attachment of policymakers in the EU – especially in Germany – to a conceptual framework that has led them consistently to underestimate the gravity of the situation and recommend policies that make matters worse.
如果央行们可以不辜负自身作为一个负责任且力量强大的机构的声誉，并兑现它们的经济承诺，这一切都不会成为问题。	All this will not matter much if central banks live up to their reputation as responsible and powerful institutions that deliver on their economic promises.
毕竟，我们大部分人知道怎么骑自行车，但我们并不真正知道我们的大脑要做些什么以实现这一目的，或者我们的大脑如何通过实践发展这一能力。	After all, most of us know how to ride a bicycle, but we are not really aware of what our brain does to achieve that feat, or how it develops that ability through practice.
少数烂苹果风险（墨西哥毒贩、伊斯兰恐怖分子、经济移民或想从福利体系中捞取好处者）永远比不上多数年轻坚而定的新移民所能带来的好处。	The risk of a few bad apples (Mexican drug dealers, Islamic terrorists, economic migrants, or those wishing to cash in on welfare systems) outweighs any benefits that the vast majority of young and determined newcomers could bring.
其竞选纲领中最高调的计划便是呼吁就欧盟的新“财政公约”进行重新谈判，这一动议获得了除英国和捷克之外所有成员国的支持。	One of the highest-flying proposals of his electoral platform was a call for renegotiation of the European Union’s new “fiscal pact,” endorsed by all member states with the exception of the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic.
提高可再生能源不到20 % ( 18个百分点 ) ， 其每年的成本五年后到2025年将会超过25亿欧元。	The annual cost of an increase in renewable energy of less than 20% (18 percentage points) – and five years later, by 2025 – will be more than €2.5 billion.
之后迪克松给我讲述了一个和他的委托人有关的典型事例，其中的主人公玛吉德·汗是一名所谓“高价值的在押犯 ” ， 他在中央情报局的“黑据点”已被关押三年之久。	Dixon then told me a revealing story of one of his clients, Majid Khan, a so-called “high-value detainee” who was held for three years in CIA “black sites.”
尽管美国领导了20世纪90年代的互联网竞赛，但如今，美国是唯一一个没有明确的数字化计划的发达经济体。	Despite having led the Internet race in the 1990s, the US is now the only major developed economy without a clear digitization plan.
因此，西方终于看到鲁哈尼和伊朗外交部长扎里夫（Javad Zarif）成为相当热心 — — 并且表面上看效率也相当高 — — 的谈判者。	Given this, the West has finally found in Rouhani and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif motivated – and ostensibly effective – interlocutors.
在IMF的分析中，亚洲受到的影响最大，其次是资源经济体；三个发达经济体的敏感性预计为中国的日本以外的亚洲贸易伙伴的一半左右。	By their reckoning, the impact on Asia would be the largest, followed closely by the resource economies; the sensitivity of the three developed economies is estimated to be about half that of China’s non-Japan Asian trading partners.
此外，全球增长因为1994年的乌拉圭回合自由贸易谈判的完成以及资本流动的总体自由化而得到了更多的提振。	Moreover, global growth received a further boost from the completion of the Uruguay Round of free-trade negotiations in 1994 and the overall liberalization of capital flows.
两年后，1971年，中国和台湾宣称对钓鱼岛拥有主权，但日本政府立场从未改变：日本对该岛的主权不容置疑。	Two years passed before Taiwan and China claimed sovereignty over the islands, in 1971, but the Japanese government’s stance has always been that Japan’s sovereignty is not in question.
我们会寻找新的全球合作措施来开发清洁能源系统、药物和疫苗、改善渔业技术、抗旱和温度变化的作物变异体、低耗油的汽车以及低成本的灌溉技术。	Look for new global cooperative approaches to clean energy systems, medicines and vaccines, improved techniques for fish farming, drought-and-temperature resistant crop varieties, high-mileage automobiles, and low-cost irrigation techniques.
自由派常常会忽视第一个信念上的不可动摇的理论和历史证据，以及坚持第二个新年给政府的政治合法性所造成的危害。	Liberals typically ignore the shaky intellectual and historical evidence for the first belief and the damage to governments’ political legitimacy wrought by their commitment to the second.
政治学家（E. E. Schattschneider）对该过程的分析产生了深远影响，导致制定贸易政策的权力从美国国会转移到总统手中。	The political scientist E.E. Schattschneider’s analysis of the process was influential in transferring responsibility for trade measures from the US Congress to the President.
比如，亚马逊公司的土耳其机器人（Mechanical Turk）计划宣称要让客户“能获得190个国家的500,000多工人的服务 ， ” 并打出了“人工人工智能”的宣传口号。	For example, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk program claims to give its customers “access to more than 500,000 workers from 190 countries,” and is marketed as a form of “artificial artificial intelligence.”
伊斯坦布尔—现在，土耳其总统埃尔多安已经实现了他的终极政治目标 — — 成为土耳其历史上第一位民选的实职总统，他在星期天的选举中赢得了近53%的全国选票。	ISTANBUL – Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has now fulfilled his ultimate political objective of being the country’s first ever popularly elected executive president, receiving almost 53% of the national vote in Sunday’s election.
如果想在不加税的情况下增加公共部门投资的话，那么预算削减就必须避免其他方面的非可持续负债膨胀到难以置信的程度。	If public-sector investment were to be increased with no rise in taxation, the budget cuts required elsewhere to avoid unsustainable debt growth would bein implausibly large.
即使中国最近因为萨德系统而对韩国施加了强大压力，其国家主席习近平在韩国人中间的受欢迎率仍然高于特朗普。	Even with China’s recent THAAD-related arm-twisting, Chinese President Xi Jinping rates more favorably among South Koreans than Trump.
虽然一些经济学教科书声称外国倾销行为会迫使国内生产者倒闭以便随后提价，但实际上并无证据表明这种行为确实有发生。	Although some economic textbooks claim that dumping by foreigners can force domestic producers to go out of business so that the foreign producer can then raise its price, there is no evidence of such behavior actually occurring in practice.
中国政府必须解决减速的短期影响，同时继续实施旨在让经济平稳过渡到新增长模式和扩大市场作���的改革。 外国企业正在试图争夺中国快速增长的中产阶级。	The government must cope with the short-term effects of the slowdown while continuing to implement reforms aimed at smoothing the economy’s shift to a new growth model and expanding the role of markets.
受法律鼓励“诽谤游”的代表官司之一是一名沙特商人起诉一名美国作家，该作家称这名沙特商人为基地组织提供经济援助。	One of the cases that illustrated the kind of “tourism” encouraged by the law involved a suit by a Saudi businessman against an American author who said in her book that the businessman had provided financial support to Al Qaeda.
从一开始，欧洲经济共同体就受到德国和法国之间的坏妥协的影响：法国农民可以超额定价，而德国可以向法国出售工业品。	From the beginning, the European Economic Community was shaped by a bad compromise between Germany and France: French farmers could charge excessive prices, and Germany could sell its industrial goods to France.
但是，由于天然气依赖于在输送中断时无法立即更换的昂贵的管道或者天然气液化设施，因此，其运输成本昂贵。	But gas is expensive to transport, for it depends on costly pipelines or gas liquefaction facilities that cannot be replaced quickly when flows are interrupted.
双方都引用英特尔的联合创始人戈登·摩尔（Gorden Moore）所创立的摩尔定律来作为论据。 该定律认为集成电路上可容��的晶体管数目，约每隔18个月便会增加一倍。	Both sides cite Moore’s Law, named for Intel’s co-founder, Gordon Moore, who noticed that the density of transistors on a chip could be doubled every 18 months.
最近在俄国，国家和公司之间的关系占据了报纸的头版头条，弗拉基米尔·普京（Vladimir Putin）总统似乎沉湎于在能源和航天领域建立“全国性大公司”的梦想。	The links between states and companies have grabbed headlines, most recently in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin seems obsessed with creating “national champions” in the energy and aerospace sectors.
一个更好的方法将则是建立一个精心设计的主权违约机制，一方面减少危机的破坏，另一方面也防止借款人觉得能靠纳税人的钱来解决所有大麻烦。	A better approach would be to create a mechanism for orchestrating orderly sovereign default, both to minimize damage when crises do occur, and to discourage lenders from assuming that taxpayers’ money will solve all major problems.
此次行动保护雅兹迪人（还有附近埃尔比勒的库尔德人和其他民族）的效果至少可以和2011年阻止卡扎菲部队屠杀班加西民众的利比亚干预行动相媲美。	It should be at least as effective in protecting the Yezidis (and Kurds and others in nearby Erbil) as was the intervention in Libya in 2011 to stop the threatened massacre by Muammar el-Qaddafi’s forces of the people of Benghazi.
奥巴马从前任接下的是如此困难的外交现实：一场全球性的经济危机，两场棘手的战争，朝鲜和伊朗队无核化进程的困扰以及越来越糟糕的中东和平进程。	difficult wars, erosion of the nuclear non-proliferation regime by North Korea and Iran, and deterioration of the Middle East peace process.
正如《拐角时代》一书所面临的争议一样，对莱恩哈特和罗格夫文章的争议表面上是源于对作者统计方法的怀疑，但根源其实在于其他人利用这项研究所可能达到的目的。	As with Time on the Cross, the Reinhart/Rogoff controversy, while ostensibly stemming from the authors’ statistical procedures, is actually rooted in the purposes to which others put their study.
汉密尔顿继续论述上述赦免权应当由个人负责行使，因为个人“最容易服从于那些可能请求减缓法律严酷性的动机 。 ”	The power to pardon, Hamilton continued, ought to be exercised by one person, because a single person “would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for the mitigation of the rigor of the law.”
苏格兰人几乎肯定会想脱离英国并以独立成员国身份重新加入欧盟，加泰罗尼亚和其他失意欧洲地区的分离主义份子会因此而倍受鼓舞（这种情况完全不符合我们的要求 ） 。	The Scots would almost certainly want to break away from England and rejoin the EU as an independent member, giving further encouragement (as if that were needed) to separatists in Catalonia and other frustrated European regions.
去年中国的国有投资机构中信集团向伊朗授予了100亿美元的信贷额度，而中国国家开发银行则承诺要再追加150亿。	Last year, the Chinese state-owned investment arm, CITIC Group, established a $10 billion credit line, and the China Development Bank has promised $15 billion more.
此外，我们自己的研究团队目前正在探索如何不进行任何化学处理或拆解即可恢复老旧太阳能或汽车电池 — — 用于住宅太阳能发电系统。	In addition, our own research team is currently exploring ways to rejuvenate old solar or car batteries – without requiring any chemical treatment or disassembly – for re-use in a residential solar-power system.
尽管如此，这种（现实主义学派可能预见到的）情况本是可以避免的，尤其如果我们能巩固现有的多边治理结构，那么就可以帮助应对好实力天平的转变。	Nonetheless, this scenario (which the realist school might foresee) can be avoided, especially if we shore up the existing structures of multilateral governance, which can help us to manage shifts in the balance of power.
他还说，目标应该定在创造欧洲各国财长“永远不需要考虑”通过欧洲稳定机制（European Stability Mechanism）对银行进行“直接资本重组”的环境。	The aim, he added, should be to create an environment in which Europe’s finance ministers “never need to consider a direct recapitalization” of a bank by the European Stability Mechanism. He was apparently reading from a textbook on moral hazard.
在战时，动动嘴皮子就能击沉船只，而秘密至关重要，丘吉尔因此认为，真相可能“过于宝贵，必须有谎言保驾护航 ” 。	In wartime, when loose lips can sink ships and secrets are crucial, Winston Churchill argued that the truth may be “so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.”
乌克兰不再限制独立的媒体和言论自由，国际观察家和各党派也公认 2004 年以来的历次选举是自由和公平的。	Independent media and freedom of speech have not been restricted in Ukraine, and elections since 2004 have been judged free and fair by both international observers and the parties themselves.
计算机技术创造了繁荣的新企业（甚至企业集群 ） ， 同时也让某些制造业工人成为冗余，让老牌制造业城市衰落。	Computer technologies have created prosperous new businesses (even business clusters) while making certain manufacturing workers redundant and sending older manufacturing cities into decline.
滋生了全球性纳粹和法西斯主义的极右翼势力遭到了政治放逐，而极左翼势力也好不到哪里去：苏联集团那种“社会主义真实样板”不仅杀人如麻，而且效率极低。	The far right, having unleashed Nazism and fascism on the world was in political exile. And the far left had its own albatross: “really existing socialism” in the Soviet bloc was murderous and unproductive.
上周末，伊拉克向世人宣告：立法委终于成立了临时政府，这个消息着实令人鼓舞，无论对伊拉克、乔治·W·布什和托尼·布莱尔来讲莫不如此。	Last weekend’s announcement that Iraqi lawmakers have finally formed a unity government is welcome news, both for Iraq and for George W. Bush and Tony Blair.
这些有机体是我们自身生物进化的产物，而瘟疫发展史（再加上艾滋病毒）或许是科学上已知的任何病原体最详细的进化记录。	These organisms are the product of their own biological evolution, and the history of the plague’s development is perhaps (along with maybe HIV) the most detailed biography of any pathogen known to science.
如果解雇工人的成本过高，企业可能就不会在市场复苏期额外雇用工人，因为担心在未来的经济衰退期劳工成本无法下降。	If the costs of firing workers are prohibitively high, firms may not hire additional workers in a market upturn, for fear that they will be unable to reduce their labor costs in a future downturn.
英国和欧盟之间的贸易和经济一体化的收益是互相的，如果欧盟认真对待其经济一体化越紧密越好的信念，其领导人就应该寻求确保各种环境下最大程度的紧密度。	The benefits of trade and economic integration between the UK and EU are mutual, and if the EU took seriously its belief that closer economic integration is better, its leaders would seek to ensure the closest ties possible under the circumstances.
华盛顿 — — 中国政府正严厉打击西方记者。 为报复纽约时报和彭博社记者对中国高官贪腐行为的报道，中国政府威胁不再为他们续签签证。	WASHINGTON, DC – China’s government is cracking down hard on Western journalists, threatening not to renew visas for reporters from the New York Times and Bloomberg in retaliation for their reporting on the corruption of senior Chinese officials.
尽管共和党参议员罗伯特·塔夫特（Robert Taft）在1950年扼杀了国际贸易组织，但随后的几十年共和党总体支持贸易自由化。	Though Republican Senator Robert Taft helped kill the International Trade Organization in 1950, the ensuing decades were characterized by a broad trend toward trade liberalization.
欧洲的局面也不比美国光明。 欧洲国家故意忽视它们的军事实力，这损害了它们在国际机制破坏时执行法治的能力。	The picture is no brighter in Europe, where countries' willful neglect of their military capabilities has undermined their ability to enforce the rule of law when international mechanisms break down.
但在经历过1990年代后期金融危机的屈辱岁月之后，普京的应对措施就是利用俄罗斯拥有的大量美元储备 — — 仅次于中国和日本。	But after the humiliation of the financial crises of the late 1990s, Putin had seen to it that Russia was armed with substantial dollar reserves – the third largest after China and Japan.
且无论全国公民登记册终稿的规模如何 — — 仍有时间对其结果提出上诉并纠正某些错误 — — 显而易见，如果最终被排除在外的不完全是孟加拉的穆斯林，这些人也将占据绝大多数。	And whatever the size of the final NRC – there is still time to appeal its findings and correct some errors – it is already clear that those ultimately excluded will be overwhelmingly, if not entirely, Bengali Muslims.
此收入损失可以用所谓的“公司税支出”的减少（即税前扣减、税收豁免和其他对某些经济活动的税收补贴）以及惩罚他人（扩大公司税基）弥补。	These revenue losses could be offset by curtailing so-called “corporate-tax expenditures” – deductions, credits, and other special tax provisions that subsidize some economic activities while penalizing others – and broadening the corporate-tax base.
西班牙银行试图通过“动态准备金”系统实施可调银行资本要求，结果并未达到在房地产繁荣期间抑制激进放贷的行为。	The Bank of Spain’s attempt to implement adjustable capital requirements for banks, through its system of “dynamic provisioning,” did little to deter aggressive lending during the country’s property boom.
影片也让我们怀疑，一个像费舍尔那样虽然麻烦重重但仍能在棋盘上化腐朽为神奇的充满创造力的天才，是否能够在当今无情的网络世界中生存。	It also makes one wonder whether a creative genius like Fischer, deeply troubled yet supremely functional at the chessboard, would be able to exist in today’s unforgiving online world.
伊朗已经与后塔利班的阿富汗和后萨达姆的伊拉克建立了良好的关系，两国的大多数高层官员都一直否认美国关于伊朗插手两国内政的指控。	Iran has established excellent relations with post-Taliban Afghanistan and post-Saddam Iraq, and the most senior officials of both countries consistently reject US allegations of Iranian interference.
众筹和点对点贷款机制让借款人有机会绕过传统银行贷款的诸多障碍 — — 在某些例子中，甚至包括抵押品和信用评级。	Crowdsourced funding and peer-to-peer lending schemes give borrowers the opportunity to circumvent many of the hurdles of traditional banking – including, in some cases, collateral requirements and credit ratings.
而且，哈萨克斯坦尽管是一个穆斯林占多数的国家，但是它建立了一种世俗、多种族以及宗教多元的政治体制，而这种体制正是西方想要在整个穆斯林世界加以鼓励的。	Moreover, Kazakhstan, though a Muslim majority country, has established the type of secular, multi-ethnic, and multi religious polity that the West is seeking to encourage throughout the Muslim world.
但他攻击美国媒体再加上对其他地方的攻击行为保持沉默，已经在很大程度上鼓励了世界各地的媒体自由侵犯者。	But his attacks on the US press, together with his silence on attacks occurring elsewhere, have gone a long way to embolden violators of press freedom around the world.
比方说在古尔一案中，古尔将自己所遭受的暴行报告给了警察，谁知在夫家认识的某些权势人物介入后，警察竟又把她送回了夫家。	Gul, for example, complained to the police about her abusive in-laws, but she was returned to the family when some of their influential contacts intervened.
除了帮助遏制当前危机，欧洲还必须致力于帮助脆弱的冲突影响国克服它们所面临的挑战，改善公民福祉，建设繁荣经济。	Beyond helping to manage the crisis today, Europe must commit to helping fragile and conflict-affected countries overcome the challenges they face, improve their citizens’ wellbeing, and build thriving economies.
通过将战争拓展到网络空间，伊斯兰国将取得非对称战争的众多优势 — — 除非美国组织起来对抗该组织的工作。	By taking the battle into cyberspace, ISIS would gain many of the advantages of asymmetric warfare – unless the US organizes itself to counter the group’s efforts.
伯克利 — — 2008年末，在金融危机面目最为狰狞的时候，世界各国分裂为两个阵营：一方在得过且过，另一方是中国。	BERKELEY – At the end of 2008, as the financial crisis hit with full force, the countries of the world divided into two groups: those whose leaders decided to muddle through, and China.
许多中国人对政府决定从利比亚撤侨的决定感到十分不满，他们更愿意留在利比亚，为保护中国商业资产做更大努力。	Many Chinese were disquieted by their government’s decision to evacuate China’s citizens from Libya, and would have preferred a bolder effort to protect the countries’ commercial assets there.
克里姆林宫放弃了民主程序，控制着那些政党可以被允许竞选及其侯选人，而普京的统一俄罗斯垄断了媒体报导。	The Kremlin abandoned democratic procedures, controlling which parties were allowed to run and their candidates, while Putin’s United Russia monopolized media coverage.
埃尔多安一直担心的来自世俗派的政变最终由他曾经的盟友发起 — — 他们本身便曾经负责罗织各种针对埃尔多安的政变罪名 — — 这是个巨大的讽刺。	It is a supreme irony that the coup Erdoğan long feared from the secularists may have eventually come from his one-time allies – who themselves were responsible for fabricating myriad coup plots against Erdoğan.
目前美国国债利率仍然很低，因此这一威胁还比较遥远，但一旦利率正常化以后，未来赤字将会远高于政府的预测值。	Interest rates on US government debt remain low, so this threat is prospective, but future deficits will be far higher than government projections when rates normalize.
各国政府应该设立明确旨在缩小教育不公 — — 包括性别、财富、城乡差距 — — 的目标，并拨出预算用于这些目标。	Every government should be setting targets aimed explicitly at narrowing education disparities – linked to gender, wealth, and the rural-urban divide – and aligning their budgets with those targets.
国家发改委研究中心李铁在2月份指出，按照当前速度，到2030年，中国每年将消费8亿吨石油，75%的石油需要进口。	As the director of the State Council’s Development Research Center, Li Wei, pointed out in February, at the current rate, China will be consuming 800 million tons of oil annually, and importing 75% of its petroleum, by 2030.
此外，如美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）所指出的 ， “ 事实上抛弃了所有马斯特里赫特条约限制、不再受德意志联邦银行模式约束”的欧洲央行已准备好进一步打破更多禁忌。	Moreover, having “effectively thrown off all of the Maastricht Treaty restrictions that bound the bank to the model of the Deutsche Bundesbank,” as former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan put it, the ECB is prepared to break further taboos.
而最近几周的民意测验支持者已经以62%的份额压倒了反对者（23 % ） ，还有15%选民依然摇摆不定。	Opinion polls conducted in recent weeks indicate that the Yes side commands a strong majority of 62% to 23%, with 15% of the electorate undecided.
2003~07年，美国政府推行财政扩张并放松金融管制 — — 这种做法即使在当时也被视为可能限制政府应对经济衰退的能力。	In 2003-2007, the US government pursued fiscal expansion and financial deregulation – an approach that, even at the time, was recognized as likely to constrain the government’s ability to respond to a recession.
20世纪90年代末进入货币联盟前后，大部分欧元区主权债务都是由国内债权人持有的：1998年，外国债权人债务持有比率只有五分之一。	Up to the late 1990’s and the advent of monetary union, most European Union sovereign debt was domestically held: in 1998, the overall ratio of foreign-held debt was only one-fifth.
只要设立明确的标准、明确的时限、积极的监督机制、常规的汇报程序和违反规则的惩戒措施，安理会就能像应对叙利亚化武事件那样取得成果。	The Council can deliver results, as it showed with Syria’s chemical arsenal, when it establishes clear benchmarks, explicit timelines, active monitoring mechanisms, regular reporting processes, and consequences for non-compliance.
但是这种共同的观点在很大程度上被误解了，因为英国的法律授予了来自所有英联邦国家的移民某种特别的东西：即在英国选举中、甚至是在国家层面的选举中投票的权利。	But that common wisdom is grossly mistaken, because British law grants immigrants from all the Commonwealth countries something extraordinary: the right to vote in British elections, even national ones.
当然，日本本次遭遇的9.0级大地震是一个极为例外的事件 — — 这个事件发生的概率是如此之小，以至于无法用基于有限历史资料的模型来进行全面评估。	The 9.0-magnitude earthquake that struck Japan is, of course, a highly exceptional event – an event so rare that its probability cannot be well assessed with models based on limited historic data.
今年，世界上最丰富、最复杂的生态系统之一、澳大利亚大堡礁世界遗产区死去近四分之一的珊瑚，是有记录以来规模最严重的珊瑚漂白。	Almost one-quarter of the coral in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area – one of the world’s richest and most complex ecosystems – has died this year, in the worst mass coral bleaching in recorded history.
共和党最巧妙的伎俩是利用程序手段让法案无法进入参议院投票，因此公众最终会把“华盛顿僵局”的责任加给奥巴马。	The Republicans’ most ingenious trick was to use procedural measures to keep bills from being brought to a vote in the Senate, so that the public would ultimately blame “the stalemate in Washington” on Obama.
为了保险起见，接收国家经常试图把移民限制在具有一技之长的工人上，因为他们加入到劳动力市场部分之中，而这些部分中足够的压低工资灵活度给移民提供了额外的就业机会。	To be on the safe side, host countries often try to limit immigration to skilled workers, because they join segments of the labor market in which sufficient downward wage flexibility provides immigrants with additional jobs.
在这样的背景下，欧盟高级代表凯瑟琳·阿什顿（Catherine Ashton）在最近访问德黑兰期间与持异见者的会晤只不过是象征性的姿态。	In this context, EU High Representative Catherine Ashton’s meeting with dissidents during her most recent trip to Tehran was merely a symbolic gesture.
法律与正义党借题发挥，并且通过将反腐败与被指称破坏波兰社会和民主的隐藏势力联系起来而巩固了其号召力。	The PiS jumped on the anticorruption bandwagon and strengthened its appeal by linking the fight against corruption to the vision of hidden forces supposedly perverting Polish society and democracy.
开尔文的洞见帮助引发了地质学家和物理学家间卓有成效的对�� — — 这场对话的甚至解决了关于达尔文的进化论实施起来需要多久的问题。	Kelvin’s insights helped to launch a fruitful dialogue between geologists and physicists – a dialogue that eventually resolved even problems related to the length of time needed for Darwin’s theory of evolution to operate.
意大利内政部长、民粹主义急先锋马特奥·萨尔维尼（Matteo Salvini）独占公众关注焦点，几乎每天都在发声“怼”移民。	In Italy, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, a populist firebrand, is monopolizing the public’s attention with almost daily outbursts against immigrants.
奥巴马政府一直在敦促安倍不要因为参拜靖国神社加剧地区紧张 — — 副总统拜登在访问北京之旅中特意经停东京，重申这一要求。	The Obama administration had been pressing Abe not to aggravate regional tensions by visiting Yasukuni – an entreaty reiterated by Vice President Joe Biden during a recent stopover in Tokyo on his way to Beijing.
前提很明确：由于危机的影响比从前都更为显著，各国之间的互相依存已经成为无法回避的事实，况且也没有另外一条道路可供选择。	The premise is clear: as the crisis made more evident than ever, the interdependence of countries is inescapable. In the face of today’s global challenges, the only possible response must be global.
甚至在石油收入可以支持相当数量的科研的国家，阿拉伯的统治者们也不鼓励这样的投资。 其结果使这些社会没有达到其本应达到的繁荣程度。	Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research, Arab rulers did not encourage such investment, with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have.
这听起来有点道理，直到你意识到他们每个人对“数据依赖”似乎都有着不同的解读，以至于这一词汇的含义似乎有点“凭直觉 ” 。	That sounds helpful until you realize that each of them seems to have a different interpretation of “data-dependent,” to the point that its meaning seems to be “gut personal instinct.”
这一认识体现在两国首脑最新会晤所公布的一项重要的新防务协议中，也体现在扩大军事销售和演习、深化印度洋合作， 以及去年的网络安全协议中。	This recognition is reflected in a significant new defense deal, announced at the recent meeting, as well as plans to increase military sales and exercises, deepen cooperation in the Indian Ocean, and build on last year’s cyber-security agreement.
但上述伎俩不但完全歪曲事实，而且显然极为虚伪，因为那些抱怨乌克兰新教学语言规定的国家也拥有类似的制度。	Beyond being a gross misrepresentation, this approach is blatantly hypocritical, as the countries that are complaining about Ukraine’s new language rules have similar systems in place.
通过要求可量化的结果，捐助方可能迫使项目经理们选择更容易实现的目标而不是采取较难量化的行动以求符合正规的人道主义原则。	By demanding quantifiable results, donors may force program managers to choose easily achieved targets over less measurable actions that accord with sound humanitarian principles.
获得2012年欧洲足球锦标赛合同的外国公司拿了政府的钱，却不向分包工程的波兰建筑公司付款的丑闻令波兰彻底名誉扫地。	Poland was wracked by scandal after the foreign firms that won contracts for the 2012 UEFA European soccer championship took the government’s money but did not pay the Polish builders to whom they sub-contracted the work.
他现在担心的是特朗普会追求“一个基本上会导致消费者享受所有的税制改革收益都被更高制造成本所夺走的政策。 “	His worry now is that Trump will pursue “a trade policy that will basically result in all the benefits of the tax reform being taken away by higher manufacturing costs being passed on to consumers.”
将自身推到世界经济中心舞台的东亚猛虎也是些小国家，某些国家例如新加坡、台湾或者香港干脆都不被视为国家。	The East Asian tigers that pushed themselves onto the world economy’s center stage were small units, and in some cases – Singapore, Taiwan, or Hong Kong – were not even treated as states.
财富的增长让消费者增加了支出，重新启动了常规扩张性乘数过程，2013年GDP增长2.5 % ， 失业率从8%下降到6.7 % 。	The rise in wealth induced consumers to increase spending, which restarted the usual expansionary multiplier process, with GDP up by 2.5% in 2013 and the unemployment rate falling from 8% to 6.7%.
最新研究表明豁免希腊的官方债务毫无疑问是值得追求的，而再来一个假协议将让希腊经济继续陷于萧条，问题在不久后必将复发。	Recent analysis shows that forgiveness of Greece’s official debt is unambiguously desirable, as another bogus deal will keep the Greek economy depressed, ensuring that the problem soon recurs.
此外，正如实际情形所显示的，如果德国是在和其欧元区伙伴玩一场危险的胆小鬼博弈，那么为何要把成本转移给IMF，而使欧洲最大最成功的经济体获益？	And if, as appears to be the case, Germany is playing a dangerous game of chicken with some of its eurozone partners, why should the cost be shifted to the IMF for the benefit of Europe’s largest and most successful economy?
业务模式的萧条和对第三方数字散播者 — — 如脸谱和谷歌 — — 的日益依赖，严重制约了新闻组织，也吞噬了它们的利润。	The erosion of business models and growing dependence on third-party digital distributors – like Facebook and Google – have handcuffed news organizations and cut deeply into their profits.
换句话说，它们发行的信用对地方经济几乎毫无用处，随后又通过利息和爆炸式增长的外币计价债务榨干地方资源。	In other words, they issued credit that contributed little to the local economy, and then drained local resources through interest and exploding foreign currency-denominated debt.
事实上，这解释了近几十年来最令人震惊的经济表现起落，如韩国和中国的起飞（分别在20世纪60年代和70年代晚期 ） 。	Indeed, this is what explains some of the most astounding turnarounds in economic performance in recent decades, such as South Korea’s and China’s breakout growth (in the 1960’s and the late 1970’s, respectively).
美联储作为事实上的全球最后贷款人，可以在政策逆转过程中通过与新兴经济体央行建立货币互换机制，从而显着提高亚洲金融安全网的有效性。	The Fed, as the de facto global lender of last resort, can improve significantly the effectiveness of Asia’s financial safety nets by establishing currency-swap arrangements with emerging economies’ central banks during the policy-reversal process.
2013年底特律市申请破产后，它面临着艰难的选择：付养老金还是还债，维持博物馆开门还是警察部队不受影响。	After the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy in 2013, it had to make tough choices between servicing its pensioners or its debt, keeping its museums open or its police force intact.
这一方法可以应用于任何高科技孵化工程（不管在发展中世界还是在发达世界 ） 。 目前，这些孵化工程的唯一测量指标就是钱。	This approach could be applied to any high-tech incubator project – within or beyond the developing world – that currently measures success only in dollars.
在1668年瑞典创立中央银行之后，英格兰央行也在1694年成立，其动机是单一经济体应该拥有一个中央银行。	When Sweden’s Riksbank was founded in 1668, followed by the Bank of England in 1694, the motivation was that a single economy should have a single central bank.
同理 ， “ 社会规范”和“分配公平的观念”也往往更有利于那些最有权力或那些能说服他人听命于强权者就是顺从上帝的人。	Similarly, “social norms” and “views about distributive justice” usually turn out to favor whomever has the biggest spear or can convince others that obedience to the powerful is obedience to God.
我们希望客服我们的不同，通过TPP携手共筑二十一世纪亚洲和太平洋经济秩序并使之成为不可撼动的增长根基。	We intend to overcome our differences and together forge, in the form of the TPP, a twenty-first-century economic order for Asia and the Pacific that will serve as an unshakable foundation for growth.
女性和儿童受影响最为严重，特别是在经济困难期他们最难获得肉类、豆类和其他含硫氨基酸来源的时候。 含硫氨基酸可以帮助肝脏分解体内的氰化物。	Women and children are the worst affected, especially during times of economic hardship, when they have the least access to meat, beans, and other sources of sulfur amino acids necessary for the liver to detoxify cyanide in the body.
该委员会1987年发表的报告《我们共同的未来》成为了一份具有里程碑意义的文件，引发了全球总统，总理和财政部长们对可持续发展的关注。	The Commission’s 1987 report, “Our Common Future,” became a landmark document that brought sustainable development to the attention of presidents, prime ministers, and finance ministers worldwide.
最近，在难民危机期间，欧班宣布了他所谓的“自由的种种”时代已经结束，并预言欧洲将向他的“基督和民主”政治愿景靠拢。	More recently, during the refugee crisis, Orbán announced the end of the era of what he called “liberal blah blah” and predicted that Europe would come around to his “Christian and national” vision of politics.
但是，过大的压力可能只会压垮巴基斯坦总统阿西夫•阿里•扎尔达里的政府 — — 阿西夫•阿里•扎尔达里本人倾向于与印度发展睦邻友好关系，但是对其所有的民选前任都被推翻的事实非常清楚。	But excessive pressure may only bring down the government of President Asif Ali Zardari, who is personally inclined towards rapprochement with India but who knows that every one of his civilian predecessors has been overthrown.
如今陷于饥馑、农业生产仅能果腹的村庄将成为食品加工和出口的商业中心，甚至成为以电力、移动电话和其他改良技术为支柱的农村工业和服务业的中心。	Villages currently trapped in hunger and subsistence agriculture would become commercial centers for food processing and exports, and even for rural industry and services supported by electrification, mobile phones, and other improved technologies.
美国的变化 — — 从过度消费大部分外包给低工资发展中国家的商品转向投资拉动型因素日益重要的经济所需要的资本设备 — — 将有利于日本最大的优势。	A shift in the US – from excessive consumption of goods largely sourced in low-wage developing countries to the capital equipment that an increasingly investment-led economy will require – would play to Japan’s greatest strengths.
过去20年来，已经有30多个国家超过1，700万农民种植了超过15亿公顷的抗旱作物 — — 没有哪里的生态系统遭到破坏，甚至都没有出现过食用者胃疼这样的结果。	Over the last two decades, such crop varieties have been cultivated on more than 1.5 billion hectares by more than 17 million farmers in some 30 countries – without disrupting a single ecosystem or causing so much as a stomachache.
因为来自自然资源相关产品的收入在国家财政收入中并未单独归类，我们只能对这笔开支如何分配进行合理的猜测。	Since there is no attribution in countries’ fiscal accounts of income from products linked to natural resources, we can only hazard a reasonably informed guess about how that spending was allocated.
事实上，中国国家主席习近平一直拒绝与安倍会面，韩国总统朴槿惠也是在本次首尔峰会上才首次同意与安倍会晤。	Indeed, Chinese President Xi Jinping has resisted meeting with Abe, as has Park, who will do so for the first time at the Seoul summit.
2009年，我们开展了联合利华可持续生活计划（Unilever Sustainable Living Plan ） ， 这是一项支持我们的社会、环境和经济表现的蓝图。	In 2009, we introduced the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, a blueprint to bolster our social, environmental, and economic performance.
这种战斗只是偶尔才会得到“官方”的报道；独立媒体进入该地区的申请被拒绝，许多身处当地的记者则死于可疑的情况。	Access to the area was denied to independent media. Many locally-based correspondents were killed in suspicious circumstances.
要么忘掉改革，花上四五十年放任其人均收入跌至智利的水平以下，要么彻底改变社会模式促使其经济开始像美国经济一样增长。	It can forget about reform and enjoy the four or five decades it will take for its per capita income to fall below the level of, say, Chile, or it can deeply change its social model and start growing like the US.
说实话，除了2009年4月伦敦峰会这个例外，G20简直成了另一个官僚主义的论坛，讨论的问题很多，达成的一致很少。	Indeed, with the exception of the London summit in April 2009, when a consensus was reached on joint monetary and fiscal stimulus, the G-20 has become just another bureaucratic forum where much is discussed, but little is agreed upon.
我们需要扩大与穆斯林国家、特别是移民输出国的对话，说服他们承认国内的伊斯兰政府在战胜极端行为方面负有特殊的责任。	We need to establish an extended dialogue with Muslim countries, particularly those from which immigrants come, and convince them to accept that their own Islamic authorities have a special responsibility in fighting radicalization.
在这两个国家，逃脱刑罚都是问题的关键：在危地马拉只有全部犯罪的大约4 % （ 至多）和谋杀罪的不超过2%最终获得刑事定罪。	In both countries, impunity is the key: in Guatemala only 4% (at most) of all crimes, and less than 2% of murders, result in a criminal conviction.
还在把金融传染威胁视为王牌的希腊政客应该注意到希腊选举和欧洲央行的债券购买计划之间的巧合，并领会其中显而易见的联系。	Greek politicians who still see the threat of financial contagion as their trump card should note the coincidence of the Greek election and the ECB’s bond-buying program and draw the obvious conclusion.
她们利用自己的设定角色象征道德权威，带着她们的观点和真相走出家庭、走上街道，她们不仅为了抽象的正义概念而战，而是为了有名有姓、有过往的儿女。	They use their given role as a badge of moral authority, taking their voices and their truth out of the home and into the streets to fight not for abstract concepts of justice, but for sons and daughters with names and histories.
尽管这一问题在20世纪90年代尚不严重 — — 欧盟国家每年总共只需要接受300,000避难申请 — — 但如今避难申请总数增长了两倍，这一规则已不再合适。	Though this may not have been a huge problem in the 1990s, when EU countries received, in all, only 300,000 asylum applications annually, it cannot work in a year when the total is expected to be triple that number.
宗教教会我们的不该是仇恨，而是 — — 再次借用孔子的名言 — — 如何建设照顾欢迎穷人、外来者和被压迫者的大同社会。	What religion should teach us is not how to hate, but – to borrow again from Confucius – how to develop societies that look after and welcome the poor, the stranger, and the oppressed.
事实上，西伯利亚和中国自己几乎没有人烟的高山/沙漠边界地区没有多大差别，在这些地区，即使种植农作物都是很艰巨的任务。	In fact, Siberia is not much different from China’s own almost empty mountain/desert borderlands, where even agriculture is a daunting task.
许多国家夸耀自身金融基础设施的现代化，这种现代化的金融基础设施是以一整套法律、法规、会计、征信、支付和结算系统为基础建立的。	Many boast of the modernity of the financial infrastructure of their economies, which is based on an entire set of legal, regulatory, accounting, credit reporting, and payment and settlement systems.
事实上，最新研究表明，规划不充分导致美国经济隔离加剧，缺乏公共交通的城市由于易得职位的短缺而陷入了贫穷陷阱。	Indeed, recent research shows how inadequate planning has fueled economic segregation in the United States, and how poverty traps have formed in cities without public transportation, owing to a shortage of accessible jobs.
近几十年来，随着预期寿命的延长以及二战后婴儿潮一代开始为退休而储蓄，金融资产相对任何经济活动指标都大幅扩张。	In recent decades, financial assets have expanded dramatically relative to any measure of economic activity, as life expectancy increased and the post-WWII baby boomers began to think about saving for retirement.
不仅他本人的演讲模式非常有效，而且在他牧师的煽动性言论威胁到他的竞选活动后，他发表了继马丁·路德·金以后美国竞选活动中最出色的演讲。	Not only was his rhetorical style effective, but after inflammatory comments by his pastor threatened to derail his campaign, he produced one of the best speeches on race in America since the days of King.
债券市场所表现的长期利率对营商条件影响甚大，投资者的观点对经济现实的影响不亚于经济现实对投资者观点的影响。	The long-term interest rates set in bond markets have so much impact on business conditions that changes in investors’ views can influence economic reality almost as much as vice versa.
逊尼派也拒绝将同样的封建主义法规用于什叶派，因为他们一直将后者视为阿拉伯兄弟，并曾经接受过逊尼派的统治，而将来也还会重归正道—除非他们有了自己的政府。	Sunnis reject the same federalism for the Shias because they view them as fellow Arabs who have always accepted Sunni rule in the past, and will do so again – unless they have their own government.
可以进行进一步合作的选项很多，无论是情报搜集，还是发展最新的反恐策略（包括反网络恐怖主义，一个北约新近接触的范畴 ） 。	The options for further cooperation are many, ranging from intelligence and procurement to the development of an updated anti-terrorism doctrine (including cyber-terrorism), a domain to which NATO is a newcomer.
2011年，大商人沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）就表明资本利得税并不会阻止投资者进行投资，也不会破坏创造就业机会。	In 2011, the businessman Warren Buffett pointed out that capital gains taxes do not stop investors from making investments, nor do they undermine job creation.
当然，这里不能不提到全球色情业的最大市场：美国。 据估算，2004年美国色情产品年收入比ABC、CBS和NBC三家电视网的收入总和还要高成百上千亿美元。	Then, of course, there is the biggest market of all: the US, where it is estimated that annual revenue for pornography in 2004 exceeded the combined revenue of the ABC, CBS, and NBC television networks by many billions of dollars.
去年12月，欧洲法院与国际法院联手明确表示摩洛哥对西撒哈拉地区不具有主权 — — 此举严重挑战了摩洛哥与欧盟的关系。	Last December, the European Court of Justice joined the ICJ in stating unequivocally that Morocco has no sovereignty over Western Sahara – a move that could pose a significant challenge to Morocco’s relationship with the European Union.
汤姆生发现电子时说 ： “ 为电子干杯：预祝它永远不会对任何人有用 ！ ” 据说纯数学家也经常对自己的职业开同样的玩笑。	Pure mathematicians supposedly tell a similar joke about their profession.
类似地，英格兰银行的金融政策委员会为2008年危机后成立，初衷是为了向当局解释哪里会出现真正的系统性风险 — — 以及应该怎样应对。	Likewise, the BoE’s Financial Policy Committee was designed after the 2008 crisis to speak truth to authority on where systemic risks really lurk – and what to do about them.
La fusion de l’Université de Copenhague avec l’Université vétérinaire et agricole royale et avec l’Université danoise des sciences pharmaceutiques en a fait la plus grande université de Scandinavie.	The University of Copenhagen’s mergers with the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University and the Danish University of Pharmaceutical Sciences have made it the largest university in Scandinavia.
美国继续资助埃及这样独裁的阿拉伯政府（年资助额少说也有20亿美元 ） ， 原因是埃及赞成与以色列实现和平，在阿以冲突中维持了美国对地域政治的影响。	The US continues to subsidize authoritarian Arab regimes, such as Egypt (which receives at least $2 billion a year), because it buys peace with Israel and maintains US geopolitical influence in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
这样的解释让恐怖行为更容易理解：恐怖网络的某个齿轮将被启动、甚至不惜对其进行洗脑来实施这样一次袭击活动。	Such an interpretation makes the act easier to understand: a cog in a terrorist network would be compelled, even brainwashed, to mount such an attack.
因此，莱茵兰模式曾经繁盛的社会公义制度注定要付出代价，而构成其它部分的资本主义也已发生了变化，而这只能责怪所谓的全球化。	Thus, the Rhineland model's once-robust institutions of social justice were bound to be squeezed. But the capitalism that formed the Rhineland model's other component also changed, and here it is not wrong to blame globalization.
但那些说合作性国��政策不可行的人没有说的是，合作性国际政策看上去永远不可行，直到突然有一天条件改变了，所有东西都走上了正轨。	But what those who say that coordinated international policy is impossible don’t say is that coordinating international policy always looks impossible, until suddenly the conditions change and everything falls into place.
这个数字会逐年增加，因为随着桥梁结构的不断瓦解，修复它们的成本只会更高；随着海平面和气温的持续升高，森林火灾的加剧，降低灾害损失的成本也会增加。	That figure increases every year, because as bridges continue to weaken, it costs even more to fix them; and as sea levels and temperatures continue to rise, and as forest fires become more severe, it costs more to mitigate the damage.
在摩洛哥，国王穆罕默德四世毫不隐瞒他对埃及政变的支持，但领导摩洛哥政府的伊斯兰正义和发展党（Islamist Justice and Development Party，JDP）意见相反。	In Morocco, King Mohammed VI did not conceal his support for the Egyptian coup, but the Islamist Justice and Development Party, which leads his government, denounced it.
因果环境大臣迈克尔·戈夫（Michael Gove）在宣布这项决定时说，其目标是“为子孙后代保护大象 ” 。	As British Environment Secretary Michael Gove put it in the announcement, the goal is to “protect elephants for future generations.”
随着我们进入本世纪的第二个十年，利用全球储蓄或盈余来资助新兴发展中国家基础建设的创新理念将受到追捧。	As we head into the second decade of the century, innovative ideas like using global savings or surpluses to finance infrastructure in emerging and developing countries should be pursued seriously.
这就是为何市场认定法国债券风险较高、因此要求更高利率的原因，尽管法国预算赤字占GDP的比重为5.8 % ， 低于英国的8.8 % 。	That is why the market treats French bonds as riskier and demands a higher interest rate, even though France’s budget deficit is 5.8% of its GDP, whereas Britain’s budget deficit is 8.8% of GDP.
但是，如果名义利率为正数，而通货膨胀率为负数，那么对出于衰退中的经济体来说，真实的利率就太高了，而且这会导致衰退更为严重而持久。	But if nominal interest rates stay positive, while inflation is negative, then real interest rates may become too high for an economy in recession, causing recession to become more severe and prolonged.
此外，许多被美国归为伊朗“恐怖主义”的东西其实是该地区伊朗支持的什叶派和沙特阿拉伯支持的逊尼派之间的宗派斗争。	Moreover, much of what the US categorizes as Iranian “terror” is a product of the region’s sectarian struggles between Shia, backed by Iran, and Sunnis, backed by Saudi Arabia.
发自伦敦 — — 数十年以来，西方人都认定宗教这东西必将随着社会的不断发展而最终消亡，但事实却并非如此，因此在这个未来十年的起始之年，政策制定者们也应该认真考虑一下宗教问题了。	LONDON – For years, it was assumed, certainly in the West, that, as society developed, religion would wither away. But it hasn’t, and, at the start of a new decade, it is time for policymakers to take religion seriously.
这样的变化 — — 以及更多的军事和情报合作 — — 将向欧洲工程注入新的活力、刺激新的热情，以及欧洲公民更大的安全感。	Such changes – along with more military and intelligence cooperation – will imbue the European project with a new dynamism, spurring more enthusiasm, not to mention a greater sense of security, among Europe’s citizens.
就连杰拉尔德·福特1974年对理查德·尼克松的赦免也是为了实现国家团结，尼克松当时因为水门事件已经辞去了总统职务。	Even Gerald Ford’s 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon, who had resigned from the presidency over the Watergate scandal, was couched in terms of national healing.
加利福尼亚州圣马提奥县（San Mateo County）的Big Lift是如今美国实施的目标更宏大的计划之一，它致力于确保该县所有儿童于都水平达到三年级（目前为43 % ） 。	One of the more ambitious initiatives being implemented today in the US is the Big Lift in San Mateo County, California, which is working to ensure that all children in the county read at grade level by third grade (the current rate is 43%).
恐怖活动轻易地就能在边境掀起一场危机，并有可能触发可悲的冲突，威胁到1979年双边关系正常化和平条约。	Terrorist activity could easily cause a crisis on the border, with the potential to trigger an unwanted confrontation that would threaten the peace treaty that normalized bilateral relations in 1979.
要求欧洲人为他们的共同防务尽更大的集体努力如今变得更加困难了，因为北约的欧洲成员国在两个重要方面出现了分裂。	Summoning from the Europeans a greater collective effort for their common defense is all the more difficult today because NATO’s European members are divided in important ways.
白宫高级助理的安全审核在如此长的时间内一直无法确定实属非同寻常 — — 情况类似的还有特朗普的女婿贾里德·库什纳，后者负责处理外交方面的事务。	It is unusual for uncertainty about the security fitness of a senior White House aide to last so long – as it also has in the case of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who handles foreign-policy issues.
石油输出国 — — 除了利比亚和也门 — — 也许避免了政治剧变，但专制交易 — — 以及任何解决它的努力 — — 变得更加昂贵了。	Oil exporters, with the exception of Libya and Yemen, may have avoided major political changes, but the autocratic bargain – and any attempt to unravel it – has become more expensive.
瑞行的措施是在国际货币基金组织决定其对瑞士进行视察的年度第四项条款之后出台的，而这个报告还没有公开发行；该文件读起来会非同寻常的有趣。	The move came one week after the IMF concluded its annual Article IV visit to Switzerland, and the report has yet to be released; it could make for unusually interesting reading.
荷兰人知道自愿安乐死在他们国家里的实施情况，他们知道合法的安乐死改进了而不是危害了他们的医疗。 他们希望有人能够帮助他们死亡，如果他们希望并且需要的话。	The Dutch know how voluntary euthanasia is practiced in their country, they know that legal euthanasia has improved, rather than harmed, their medical care, and they want the possibility of assistance in dying, if they should want and need it.
美国、印度、欧洲和日本将不得不在满足本国短期军事需求和促进中亚地区政治改革、以建立更加稳定可靠的伙伴关系的长期目标之间面对越来越多的激烈冲突。	America, India, Europe, and Japan will face increasing tension between their short-term military needs in the region and their long-term goal of promoting political reform in order to create more stable and reliable partners.
最后，如果要避免欧洲再次爆发一场类似的危机，就必须以更具雄心壮志的改革 — — 财政和政治联盟 — — 来为货币联盟做补充。	Finally, there are the more ambitious reforms – fiscal union and political union – that must complement monetary union if Europe is to avoid a similar crisis in the future.
在笔者与尼古拉斯·科尔达西埃（Nicolas Coeurdacier）和史黛芬妮·居堡（ Stéphane Guibaud）的联合研究中，我们找到了经济数据来支持上述观点。	In joint research with Nicolas Coeurdacier and Stéphane Guibaud, we show that economic data supports this view.
中国这个小小的动作（允许人民币对美元升值2 % ） 聪明就聪明在没有人知道接下来在什么时候会发生什么。	The genius of China’s mini-move (allowing the Yuan to rise 2% against the dollar) is that no one can tell when or what is going to happen next.
传统智慧认为当她在2021年德国下一次联邦大选后交出总理职位时 — — 如果她的大联盟陷入崩溃可能还要早得多 — — 人们会非常想念她。	According to the conventional wisdom, when she hands over the chancellorship after Germany’s next federal election in 2021 – and perhaps much sooner if her grand coalition collapses – she will be sorely missed.
但是如果根据这种分析就认为对于失业率不能够有所作为��或者货币管理部门应该只关心通货膨胀率，那就是对这一分析的误用了。	But it is a misuse of that analysis to conclude that nothing can be done about unemployment, or that monetary authorities should focus exclusively on inflation.
这样的处罚方式不仅缺乏人道，而且在经济上也不可持续：应当鼓励这些国家的领导人把稀缺的执法、审判和监狱资源用来惩治性质更严重的犯罪。	This approach is not only inhumane, but also economically untenable: leaders in these countries should be encouraged to redirect scarce law enforcement, court, and prison resources towards more pressing causes.
造成这一现象的部分原因是，苏联对此的最初反应是诡秘的。 当时的苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在1986年5月14日，也就是事故发生几周后才对此发表电视讲话。	In part, this is because the initial Soviet response was secretive: Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader at the time, addressed the issue on television only weeks later, on May 14, 1986.
而当西方对核能的认可度大幅减少之时，核能却在那些所谓“核能新玩家”中走红，并为其带来了新的挑战，包括对这些国家将核燃料浓缩制成核武器的担忧。	While the appeal of nuclear power has declined considerably in the West, it has grown among the so-called “nuclear newcomers,” which brings with it new challenges, including concerns about proliferation of nuclear weapons.
在制定后2015年发展议程时，各国领导人必须认识到少些暴力、多些和谐的社会能为经济发展提供的巨大动力。	In formulating the post-2015 development agenda, world leaders must recognize the tremendous impetus that less violent, more harmonious societies would provide for economic development.
如果最近批驳中等收入陷阱的研究是正确的，那么中国 — — 历史上最不可思议的增长故事之一 — — 很有希望带着同样的力道成功进入高收入行列。	If the recent research debunking the middle-income trap is correct, China – one of history’s most miraculous growth stories – has a very good chance of succeeding in the transition to high-income status with similar vigor.
被动的追随者会保持低调、规避风险、免遭批评；而机会主义者则运用这一管理松散之处经营私利，而非助力于领导或群众。	A passive follower keeps his head down, shuns risk, and avoids criticism. An opportunist uses the slack to feather his own nest rather than help the leader or the public.
上个月，22岁、在英国出生的利比亚难民之子阿贝迪（Salman Ramadan Abedi）在美国流行歌星阿利亚纳·格兰德（Ariana Grade）的英国曼彻斯特演唱会现场引爆自杀式袭击的炸弹。	Last month, Salman Ramadan Abedi – a 22-year-old British-born son of Libyan immigrants – carried out a suicide bombing at the concert of the American pop star Ariana Grande in Manchester, England.
与此同时，前总统萨科齐和前总理朱佩正在争夺对中右翼反对派的控制以挑战奥朗德和阻挡极右翼的国民阵线的马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen ） 。	Meanwhile, former President Nicolas Sarkozy and former Prime Minister Alain Juppé are vying for control of the center-right opposition in order to challenge Hollande and head off Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front.
为了保卫银行体系，美联储将利率维持在人为的低水平；而最新的披露表明，它还向银行提供了1.2万亿美元的秘密贷款。	In order to rescue the banking system, the Federal Reserve, for example, put interest rates at artificially low levels; as was disclosed recently, it also has provided secret loans of $1.2 trillion to banks.
毫无疑问，美国劳动力市场的复苏之所以不平均，很大程度上要归因于2008年全球金融危机及其后的衰退所暴露的结构和政策差异。	Undoubtedly, the US labor market’s uneven recovery has much to do with the structural and policy gaps exposed by the 2008 global financial crisis and the recession that followed.
亚洲的数字是阿富汗30 % ， 塔吉克斯坦38 % ， 而欧洲的摩尔多瓦31%的国内生产总值源自国外汇款。	In Asia, the figures were 30% for Afghanistan and 38% for Tajikistan, while in Europe Moldova received 31% of its GDP from external sources.
但从那以后叙利亚已不再是人们关注的核心，取而代之的是埃及政变和持续危机、也门和其他地方“基地”组织的恐怖进攻威胁以及以巴和谈的重启。	But Syria has since moved from the center of attention, displaced by the coup and ongoing crisis in Egypt, the threat of an Al Qaeda terror offensive in Yemen and elsewhere, and the renewal of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
在两位领导人让两国不可挽回地陷入未来几十年的可以避免和灾难性的冲突之前，他们应该仔细思考这对于美国和中国，以及整个世界意味着什么。	Before these two leaders irreversibly doom their two countries to spend the next decades locked in a devastating and avoidable conflict, they should carefully consider what that would mean not just for the US and China, but for the entire world.
在我们的研究中，我们探寻了使用PARP抑制剂的必备条件，尤其针对具有BRCA1或BRCA2缺陷的癌细胞。	In our research, we exploit this requirement to specifically target the BRCA1 or BRCA2-defective cancer cells with inhibitors of PARP.
中国主席习近平及其政治局应当向外界表明他们将在今年秋天举行的中国共产党第19次全国代表大会上致力于实现这个目标。	Chinese President Xi Jinping and his politburo should signal that they are committed to this goal before they gather for the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party this fall.
达到这一效果的方法很多，但奥巴马政府所陈述的目标 — — 在产能大量闲置的情况下到2013年使预算赤字减半 — — 并不在其列。	This can be done in several ways, but the Obama administration’s stated goal – halving the budget deficit by 2013 while the economy is operating far below capacity – is not one of them.
而这也有助于设立一个框架，来容纳越来越多关于是应当发展更高效的欧洲防务，还是对美欧大西洋联盟进行重大改革的辩论。	It also helped frame the growing debate over whether to develop European defense more effectively or to seriously reform the Atlantic alliance.
即使取得了如此大的进步，我们仍然可以在整个星球 — — 包括所有人和物 — — 联网的过程中期待更快的进步。	Even with these massive gains, we can expect still faster progress as the entire planet – people and things – becomes connected.
自由国际社会的理论核心已经空洞化，曾经被视为现代世界的标志的基本思想 — — 自由贸易、民主、人权 — — 要么正在倒退，要么饱受威胁。	The liberal international order’s philosophical core has been hollowed out, with fundamental ideas that were once considered staples of the modern world – free trade, democracy, human rights – either in retreat or under threat.
但它也带来了更多的复杂性，比如，美国国会在日本宣布渴望加入TPP谈判后立刻表现出抵触，美国汽车业高管对此也颇有微词。	But it also brings added complexity, reflected in the reluctance shown by the US Congress immediately after Japan announced its desire to join the TPP negotiations, as well as in recent comments by American auto executives.
第二个结论是毛收益—付给赢家的费用、交易盈利和资本收益（可能是今年并购总值中的8000亿美元 ） - -大大超过1700美元的可能净收益。	The second conclusion is that the gross gains – fees, trading profits, and capital gains to the winners (perhaps $800 billion from this year’s M&A’s) – greatly exceed the perhaps $170 billion in net gains.
这部小说断然否定简单化，也否定了当今的流行思潮 — — 混淆信息与文学、现实与创造力以及畅销作品与真正艺术品。	By renouncing simplicity, it also repudiates today’s prevailing confusion of information with literature, of facts with creativity, and best-selling products with true works of art.
换句话说，VC资金并不十分热衷支持可能带来大量本地就业岗位、刺激本地繁荣的新企业，而是热衷支持接近于启动数十亿美元IPO的企业。	In other words, VC funds are not well suited to support new businesses that may generate a large number of jobs and boost prosperity locally, but that are not close to launching a billion-dollar IPO.
通过建立稳定的法律框架、提供国际协议条件下的信用担保、让中央银行参与大规模投资，政府可以帮助太阳能电力变得更加普及。	By creating a stable legal framework, providing credit guarantees in the context of international agreements, and involving central banks in large-scale investments, governments can help to make solar power more accessible.
事实上有超过一半的埃及人年龄低于25岁，而埃及跟世界上其他几个国家一样，正在面对着极端艰巨 — — 而且很大程度上无法满足 — — 的就业压力，无法确保为这些青年人提供体面的工作岗位。	Indeed, half of Egypt’s population is under age 25. Egypt, like dozens of countries around the world, is facing the extreme – and largely unmet – challenge of ensuring productive and gainful employment for its young people.
首尔 — — 据朝鲜电视台报道，12月17日致金正日死亡的心脏病发作是因“过度劳累引发的严重的精神和身体压力导致的 。 ”	SEOUL – According to North Korean state television, the heart attack that killed Kim Jong-il on December 17 was “due to severe mental and physical stress from overwork.”
对于欧盟与俄罗斯和土耳其的关系（以及俄土两国关系）的问题，成员国需要形成一致的承认所有各方利益的政策。	For issues such as EU relations with Russia and Turkey (and these two countries’ relations with each other), member states need to agree on a policy that recognizes the interests of all.
在朝鲜问题上，特朗普的方针更加鲁莽，他威胁说，如果朝鲜不同意放弃核计划，美国将“彻底摧毁”这个国家。	In the case of North Korea, Trump’s approach is even more reckless, threatening that the US will “totally destroy” the country if it does not agree to abandon its nuclear program.
然而这样的主张忽视了过去几年来的记录。 在此期间，一届又一届政府实施了公平地说相当彻底的措施来增强希腊的财政状况、削减公职人数。	And yet such assessments overlook the record of the past few years, during which successive governments have taken some fairly radical measures to strengthen Greece’s fiscal position and scale back the public payroll.
因为CDS的作用是对于放款人监管义务能力的一种保险，CDS使得公司或者证券的负面信息更容易被传递出来。	Because they function as insurance on borrowers’ ability to meet their obligations, they make it easier to express a negative opinion on a company or a security.
但这并不意味着知识分子应当躲进学术掩体，在保护我们免受“非专家”责难的同时，允许自我意识迅速泛滥，允许自己关注对其他任何人都无关紧要的话题。	But this does not mean that intellectuals should hide in academic bunkers that, by protecting us from criticism by “non-experts,” allow ego to flourish and enable a focus on questions that are not actually relevant to anyone else.
GTA近期一份报告显示：自从2008年11月份以来，至少有192个贸易保护主义的措施出现，针对的主要目标是中国，相关报道在一些金融报纸中也被广泛地提及。	The GTA’s latest report identifies no fewer than 192 separate protectionist actions since November 2008, with China as the most common target. This number has been widely quoted in the financial press.
桑托斯成功克服了艰巨的挑战，接下来摆在面前的挑战是即将到来的全民公决。 我们希望哥伦比亚民众能够认识到他们为充满了冲突的世界提供了新的和平模型。	Santos has overcome formidable challenges, and the next one is a forthcoming plebiscite, where the Colombian people, one hopes, will recognize that their country has furnished a conflict-ridden world with a new model for peace.
而即使这一点被接受，当大量人群蜂拥来到欧洲海岸，不容你否认促使他们逃离的粗暴行为时，也会产生第三种烟幕。	And even when that is accepted, when the sheer number of people clamoring to get to Europe’s shores makes it all but impossible to deny the barbarity driving them to flee, a third smokescreen goes up.
在世界各地的“魅力城市 ” ， 度假住宅的繁荣似乎在心理上与城市住宅的价格泡沫密切相关，而这些度假住宅的价格也同样可能在未来几年内经历大幅度的下降。	The vacation-home boom appears psychologically tied to the urban home-price bubble in many of the world’s “glamour cities,” and prices of these vacation homes are similarly vulnerable to a significant drop in coming years.
朝鲜半岛上，中国、日本、俄国和美国的利益直接交叉，在这里实现和平和无核化是全球最重要的安全目标之一。	Securing a peaceful and nuclear-free Korean peninsula, a place where the interests of China, Japan, Russia, and America directly intersect, is one of the most important security goals anywhere on the planet.
这在今天尤其重要。 全世界193个国家的政府正在制定可持续发展目标（SDG）指导未来15年的全球发展政策。	This is particularly relevant today, as the world's 193 national governments work to establish the Sustainable Development Goals to guide global development efforts for the next 15 years.
纽约 — — 出生于一个被称为全新世的气候时代的现代人类已经跨过边界进入到另一个气候时代，人类世之中。	NEW YORK – Modern humans, born into one climate era, called the Holocene, have crossed the border into another, the Anthropocene.
只要更多的国家都能花点时间来学习别国的成功经验，对它们来说当前这种“政策套利”的巨大机会就依然存在。	Today, too, there are some great opportunities for this kind of “policy arbitrage,” if more countries would only take the time to learn from other countries’ successes.
比如，某人每年获得8,000美元转移支付（如食品券、住房补贴和工作所得税收优惠 ） ， 他有可能被认定为获得了相当于4美元时薪，这将被算入他的最低工资。	For example, someone who receives $8,000 a year in transfer payments (such as food stamps, housing assistance, and the Earned Income Tax Credit) might be deemed to have received the equivalent of $4 an hour toward meeting the minimum wage.
但反对该协定也许是目前剩下的美国总统候选人唯一达成共识的问题，而加拿大贸易部长也对该协定表示严重保留。	But opposition to the agreement may be the only issue that the remaining US presidential candidates can agree on, and Canada’s trade minister has expressed serious reservations about it.
英国也追求了强劲的量化宽松 — — 并且与美国一样，也因此经历了相对强势的经济增长（正因如此，日内瓦讨论会的英国与会者应该更加理解安倍经济学 ） 。	The United Kingdom, too, pursued robust QE – and, like the US, it is now experiencing relatively strong economic growth (which is why the British participants in Geneva should have known better).
所以在这种情况下，尽管美国与世界的贸易逆差依然如故，但对双边贸易失衡状况的关注带来了令人满意的政策变化。	So, in this case, the focus on the bilateral trade imbalance has led to desirable policy changes, even though the US trade deficit with the world will not decline.
尽管53%的美国穆斯林认为从2001年恐怖袭击以来日子难过了一点，但是大多数认为这是政府的过错，而不是他们邻居的过错。	Although 53% of US Muslims think that life is more difficult since the terrorist attacks of 2001, most think that this is the fault of the government, not their neighbors.
当然，印度现在也面临着问题重重：还有大约3000万的印度人生活在贫穷之中；纳萨尔派游击分子势力的扩张；孟买恐怖袭击的危险和城市贫民窟的不断膨胀。	Yet India continues to face many challenges: nearly 300 million people living in poverty, the spreading Naxalite insurgency, the danger of terrorist attacks ala Mumbai, and sprawling urban slums.
相反，我们必须投资和推广新技术，理顺激励，认识到卫生体系无法存在于真空中，以此将公共卫生体系推广到常规边界之外。	Instead, we must push public health systems beyond their usual boundaries by investing in and promoting new technologies, sharpening incentives, and recognizing that health systems do not exist in a vacuum.
中国在这一问题上押上了国家尊严和领导人的民族主义情操，这意味着习近平可能会断然拒绝美国要求中国停止所有被视为对其在争议海域的新造人工岛进行军事化改造的行为。	China has staked its national prestige and its leadership’s nationalist credentials on this issue, which means that Xi is likely to rebuff US demands that China cease all activities seen as militarizing its new artificial islands in disputed waters.
甚至罗姆尼本人到最后也向特朗普低了头，在选举后几周与这位当选总统进行了会晤，据说是为了谋求一个内阁职位。	Even Romney himself bowed to Trump in the end, meeting with the president-elect a couple of weeks after the election, reportedly in search of a cabinet position.
这样，调整负担就将由其他债权人共同承担（如同希腊那样 ） ， 经济将赢得复苏时间，特别是在对世界最大石油储备的投资即将产生结果的当口。	That way, the burden of adjustment would be shared with other creditors, as has occurred in Greece, and the economy would gain time to recover, particularly as investments in the world’s largest oil reserves began to bear fruit.
从奥巴马总统上任之初开始，随着茶党民粹主义者登上核心政治舞台，因为领导了抹黑美国首位黑人总统的运动，特朗普的受欢迎程度就开始与日俱增。	Starting early in Barack Obama’s presidency, as Tea Party populists took center stage, Trump became popular, because he championed efforts to delegitimize America’s first black president.
四月，美国国家卫生研究所推出了10年期脑病治疗计划，欧盟、以色列、日本、中国、澳大利亚和加拿大也采取了类似的举措。	In April, the United States National Institutes of Health introduced a ten-year BRAIN Initiative, joining similar efforts in the European Union, Israel, Japan, China, Australia, and Canada.
平民大规模流离失所的镜头很少出现在电视荧屏上，因为与炸弹和自杀式袭击不同，流离失所不会带来鲜血、火焰或哀嚎等抓人眼球的画面。	Only rarely do scenes of massive displacement of the civilian population make it onto our television screens, because, unlike bombs and suicide attacks, displacement does not generate the blood, fire, or screams that constitutes compelling footage.
美国和西方很多人将鲁哈尼视为伊斯兰共和国的温和派，因为艾哈迈迪内贾德更加激进而把他视作伊朗人的本来面目。	In America and the West, many will probably regard Rowhani as the friendly face of the Islamic Republic, whereas Ahmadinejad was its true – because more radical – embodiment.
如今，巴以冲突已经进行了至少45年，它已经不再是个复杂的问题；相反，我们可以用美国政治家詹姆斯·卡维尔（James Carville）的话言简意赅地予以总结 ： “ 重要的是占领，笨蛋 。 ”	The Palestinian-Israeli conflict, now at least 45 years old, is not a complicated problem; on the contrary, it can be summed up quite succinctly: to paraphrase the American political operative James Carville, “It’s the occupation, stupid.”
要完善这方面的措施，我们还必须投资于理解这些风险因素 — — 最常见的情况是与儿童期和成人期进行衔接研究 — — 如何影响青少年健康。	To complement this effort, we must also invest in improving our understanding of how these risk factors – most often studied in connection with early childhood and adulthood – affect adolescents’ health.
在拉丁美洲国家已经进行了试验，也就是把上学和接种疫苗作为儿童津贴的条件。 在人道主义危机发生的时候，有时候就用现金援助取代食品援助。	Experimental schemes have been implemented in Latin America in which child allowances are conditional on school attendance and vaccination.
习近平最近在中共十九大中巩固了自己的权力，有望在解决国际冲突，特别是直接影响中国的国际冲突中扮演更加积极主动的角色。	Having recently consolidated his power at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Xi will probably assume a more proactive role in international conflict resolution, especially in areas that affect China directly.
东京—成功的外交峰会几乎总是周详备至的，会议的各个方面，从一开始的握手到最后的公报，都可以精确到分钟。	TOKYO – Successful diplomatic summits are almost always pre-cooked affairs, with every aspect of the meeting, from the initial handshakes to the final communiqué, minutely choreographed.
渴望皇冠的普京忘记了俄罗斯君主固然表面光鲜，始终危机四伏，因为独裁对法律的蔑视让他很容易遭遇暴民正义。	Pining for a crown, Putin forgets that Russian monarchy, for all its splendor, was always a minefield, because an autocrat’s contempt for law leaves him vulnerable to mob justice.
伦敦 — — 随着英国退欧辩论的日渐升级 ， “ 留欧”和“退欧”已经成为下周举行英国退欧公投所面临的严峻选择。	LONDON – As the United Kingdom’s debate about whether to withdraw from the European Union has heated up, “in” and “out” have come to define the stark choice facing voters in next week’s “Brexit” referendum.
默克尔从未采取任何措施让德国能为应对威胁其制造业核心 — — 尤其是汽车行业的数字破坏做好准备，前车之鉴就是苹果iPhone对诺基亚的影响。	Merkel has done nothing to prepare Germany for the digital disruption that threatens to do to its manufacturing heartland – notably its car industry – what Apple’s iPhone did to Nokia.
对于那些准备奔赴哥本哈根的人来说，最重要的一步就是要制定一系列提高能源利用率和减少温室气体排放的国内政策。	The most important step for those preparing for Copenhagen is to embrace national policies that increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
这样的地区性集团会以长期共同的历史和一致的利益为纽带。 这样的结合会比维谢格拉德集团更加有效和持久。	Such a regional group would be bound together by a long common history and compatible interests.
一项由美国提出、尚未确保政府会支持的倡议，远远不够，只有美国与中国结为伙伴关系，才能获得足够的规模与速度来迎接挑战。	A US initiative that is not assured of gaining government support would be insufficient, and only if the US forms a partnership with China would adequate scale and speed be attained to meet the challenge.
而始于2002年并于不久前刚刚结束的欧元对美元升值则意味着西非法郎在从法国法郎转而钉住欧元时重演了1994年的悲剧。	And the euro’s appreciation against the dollar from 2002 until very recently meant that the shift in the CFA franc’s exchange-rate peg from the French franc to the euro caused a repeat of that scenario.
在最近的G-20财长上海会议上，与会者也问了相同的问题 — — 不仅仅是为萎靡的全球增长中期预期而问。	At the recent meeting of G-20 finance ministers in Shanghai, participants were asking much the same question – and not just with regard to medium-term expectations of weak global growth.
以国防军显然更愿意拥有掌握更多领土所带来的战略优势，但不论条件如何，它都将完成以色列政府授予它的任务。	While the IDF would certainly prefer to operate with the strategic advantages that holding more territory can confer, it would fulfill its mission under whatever conditions the Israeli government set for it.
啮齿类和人类控制威胁状态下的行为反应的大脑系统大同小异，都涉及到深藏于大脑中、不受意识控制的古老区域（比如杏仁体 ） 。	The brain systems that control behavioral responses in threatening situations are similar in rodents and humans, and involve older areas deep in the brain that work nonconsciously (for example, the amygdala).
而且，奥巴马还利用经济危机的机会，做成了多年以来一直没有的做成的事情：将8国集团扩充到20国集团，在其中增加了一些主要的新兴市场国家。	Moreover, Obama used the crisis to accomplish what many had suggested for years: transform the G-8 into a broader institutional framework of a G-20 that includes the major emerging economies.
继续在伊朗开展业务的外国公司现在面临制裁威胁，而处理交易的银行则很可能会失去进入美国金融系统的机会。	Foreign firms that continue to conduct business in Iran now face the threat of sanctions, and banks that process transactions risk losing access to the US financial system.
大部分央行的危机前模型 — — 包括正式模型和指导决策者思维的思维模型 — — 大有问题，这理应显而易见。	It should have been apparent that most central banks’ pre-crisis models – both the formal models and the mental models that guide policymakers’ thinking – were badly wrong.
或者，以联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯所提出的奇怪建议为例，古特雷斯称气候政策将带来“至少价值26万亿美元的经济效益 。 ”	Or consider the strange suggestion by UN chief António Guterres that climate policies will bring “at least $26 trillion in economic benefits.”
比如，最近他谴责那种认为一战期间澳大利亚在1916年加利波利战役中的牺牲在某种程度上造就和赎回了他的国家的观点。	Recently, for example, he denounced the idea that Australian sacrifices in the Gallipoli campaign of 1916 during World War I had somehow made and redeemed his nation.
另有一次，囚室没有通风，室温高达100华氏度，被囚者躺在地上几乎失去知觉，旁边还有一堆头发 — “ 很明显，他整夜都在抓扯着自己的头发 。 ”	On another occasion the room was unventilated, the temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the detainee was almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next to him – “he had apparently been pulling it out throughout the night.”
根据经合组织的说法 ， “ 没有有力的理由让人相信近来的结构改革能有效降低经合组织国家劳动力市场对严重经济萎缩的敏感度 。 ”	According to the OECD, “there does not appear to be any strong reason to expect that recent structural reforms mean that OECD labor markets are now substantially less sensitive to severe economic downturns.”
随着起义势力所造成的压力越来越大，卡扎菲把维持权力的最后希望放在了中国身上，而对后者染指非洲的忧虑也只能靠边站了。	As the pressure from the rebels grew, Qaddafi’s last hope for maintaining power became China, and so fear of its influence in Africa was brushed aside.
大部分水稀缺国家都管理着淡化水的使用，但决策者需要更新他们的投资策略、水管理政策和公共预算以充分整合水资源。	While most water-scarce countries regulate the use of desalinated water, decision-makers need to update their investment strategies, water-management policies, and public budgets to integrate the full range of water resources.
而今天共和党的多数议员似乎单方面致力于延缓和缩窄对俄罗斯全力支持特朗普赢得2016年大选进行任何严肃的调查活动，相关报告已经完全拥有过硬的证据支持。	Today’s Republican congressional majorities, however, have seemed singularly devoted to slowing and narrowing any serious inquiry into the thoroughly substantiated reports of Russian efforts to throw the 2016 election to Trump.
欧盟必须让埃尔多安明白他现在所走的道路离欧盟成员资格越来越远，而且可能让土耳其付出损失重要经济联系的惨重代价。	They must make him understand that his current path leads away from EU membership and could cost Turkey some of the economic ties on which it depends.
不仅如此，失业年轻人在暴力活动中寻找自我价值和经济回报可能使失业引发进一步冲突，因此创造就业机会应当是后冲突期的核心政策。	Moreover, because unemployment can spur more conflict, as unemployed young people find validation and economic rewards in violent movements, job creation should be a central part of post-conflict policy.
根据斯坦福大学知名经济史学家保罗·戴维（Paul David）的研究，当年作为新技术的电力就是个典型的例子。	Electricity, the new technology studied by the eminent Stanford University economic historian Paul David, is a classic case in point.
最近，麦肯锡调查了1,000名高管和公司董事，其中63%表示过去几年中股东对实现短期回报的压力有所增加。	In a recent McKinsey survey of 1,000 top executives and corporate directors, 63% reported that shareholder pressure to realize short-term returns has increased over the last several years.
欧洲议会对英国、瑞典、法国和德国（可能很快就会包括荷兰）实施公众监控行为的批评似乎并没影响到国家政府。	The European Parliament’s criticism of the mass surveillance practiced by the UK, Sweden, France, and Germany (and potentially soon by the Netherlands) seems not to carry much weight for national governments.
将保险原则应用于贸易风险是如此困难的其中一个原因在于，如果政府提供针对自由贸易生计风险的保险，那看起来就像是重新分配。	One reason why it has been so difficult to apply the principle of insurance to trade risks is that if the government offers the coverage against risks to livelihoods from free trade, it just looks like redistribution.
2008年美国经常项目赤字接近GDP的5 % （ 在2007年的几个季度接近7 % ） ，而中国则保持了令人咋舌的经常项目盈余，占GDP的9%或更高。	While the US’s current-account deficit was close to 5% of GDP in 2008 (and closer to 7% in some quarters of 2007), China was maintaining a whopping current-account surplus of 9% or higher.
如果各国履行其在巴黎气候协定下所作出的承诺，海平面的上升幅度有可能被控制在一半左右，更雄心勃勃的计划甚至可能实现更高的目标。	If countries meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement, the total sea-level rise could be halved, with more ambitious schemes promising even greater reductions.
这不仅仅意味着能够为潜在的巨大的出口市场生产产品；重要的是，它还涉及到引进一种重要的无形资产：即知识。	It also involves, crucially, importing an essential intangible asset: knowledge.
相反，将中国视为机遇契合美国自身的再平衡需要 — — 重塑美国竞争力，争夺中国即将到来的内需繁荣份额。	By contrast, viewing China as an opportunity underscores the need for America to undertake its own rebalancing – rebuilding US competitiveness and pushing for a meaningful share of China’s coming boom in domestic demand.
也许欧盟应该 大胆地创造一个美国式的两院制议会，把欧洲议会变成众议院，并选举出一个参议院以取代部长会议，并由各会员国派两位参议员。	Rather than tinkering, perhaps the EU should boldly create an American-style bicameral system by turning the parliament into a House of Representatives and electing a Senate to replace the Council of Ministers, with two senators per member state.
此类政策还将损害小储户的利益，促进收入进一步在顶层集中，同时它还将创造机会，让实际成本为负的储蓄资金惠及大型金融机构。	They also contribute to further income concentration at the top by hurting small savers, while creating opportunities for large financial players to benefit from access to savings at negative real cost.
伊朗早就明确地表示它希望重新获得作为地区 — — 事实上是全球 — — 主要大国的历史低位，而在看到土耳其地缘政治地位上升后，伊朗的这一雄心越发高涨了。	Iran has long made clear that it wants to resume its historic position as a major regional – and indeed global – power, an ambition that can only grow stronger as it watches Turkey’s geopolitical stature rise.
从 1990 年到 2005 年，德国在高失业、低增长和低竞争力的困境中苦苦挣扎，而欧洲经济也跟着熬了一段苦日子。	From 1990 to 2005, Germany struggled with high unemployment, slow growth, and low competitiveness, and Europe’s economy suffered as a result.
快速通道办法，即官方所谓的贸易促进授权（Trade Promotion Authority ） ， 之所以能够通过，唯一的原因是奥巴马能够罕见地在众议院和参议院都依靠共和党多数的支持。	The fast-track measure, officially known as Trade Promotion Authority, passed only because Obama was able to rely on rare backing from the Republican majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
脱拜尔斯作为美国国际发展署署长落实了布什政府的政策，即要求想要获得美国援助的治疗预防艾滋病组织谴责卖淫。	As the administrator of the US Agency for International Development, Tobias implemented the Bush administration’s policy that requires organizations working against HIV/AIDS to condemn prostitution if they are to be eligible for US assistance.
迄今未知，我们的选择的质量并不令人信服，并未体现出多少对可持续性和我们的选择对子孙后代所造成的影响的顾忌。	Thus far, the quality of our choices has been unimpressive, reflecting little sensitivity to sustainability and the impact of our choices on future generations.
这次衰退的规模如此巨大，以至于世界经济所有主要地区的失业率都将大幅度攀升，美国的失业率可能会达到9 % — 10 % 。	The size of this downturn is so large that unemployment will rise sharply in all major regions of the world economy, perhaps reaching 9-10% in the US.
应当注意到，2001年以来，美国也许比历史上的任何时候都与更多的国家、以更为建设性的方式、在世界更多的地方作出了更多的工作。	It is important to note that since 2001, the US has probably done more things, with more nations, in more constructive ways, and in more parts of the world, than at any other time in its history.
如果没有发生重大的通货膨胀，美国的名义房价可能还要再下跌15 ％ ， 对西班牙、英国和很多其他国家来说，要下跌得更多。	Absent significant inflation, nominal house prices probably need to fall another 15% in the US, and more in Spain, the UK, and many other countries.
这不仅毫无必要，还是一种浪费，因为它很可能产生整整一代人因为没有足够的技能储备而无力推动未来的经济增长。	This is not only unnecessary, but also wasteful, because it risks creating a generation that will be ill equipped to drive future growth.
如果中日战争的惨状不曾在当代中国人的生活中一再改编，目前围绕日本控制的尖阁列岛（中国称钓鱼岛）的争议可能也不会如此之大。	The current dispute in the East China Sea over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands (the Diaoyu Islands in China) would likely be less tense if the atrocities of the Sino-Japanese War were not rehashed so often in contemporary Chinese life.
此外即将出台的税收立法中的国际条款将令美国跨国公司更有动力在海外投资，雇佣和生产，同时利用转移定价以及其他手段来在低税收地区保留利润。	Moreover, international provisions in the pending tax legislation will give US multinationals an even greater incentive to invest, hire, and produce abroad, while using transfer pricing and other schemes to salt away profits in low-tax jurisdictions.
Philippe Jorion和William Goetzmann的研究发现，39个拥有可靠股票价格数据、尽管没有红利数据的国家成为了二十世纪值得称道的一部���。	A study by Philippe Jorion and William Goetzmann found 39 countries with reliable stock price data – though not dividend data – for a good part of the twentieth century.
皮尔克警告说，一个科学的声音占主导地位的技术官僚文化会让政客用技术问题 （ “ X是否符合安全标准 ？ ” ）上的专家意见误导政治日程 （ “ X是正确的待办事项 。 ”	A technocratic culture in which scientific voices dominate, Pielke warns, tempts politicians to use expert advice on technical questions (“Does X meet safety standards?”) to disguise political agendas (“X is the right thing to do.”).
如果欧洲人对他们的人权和自由的共同领域郑重其事，那么他们就必须承认，普京的克里姆林宫里狡猾的禄虫们并不认同这些价值观。	If Europeans are serious about their common space for human rights and freedoms, they must recognize that those values are not shared by the calculating placemen of Putin’s Kremlin.
尽管他公开地对英国情报机关有关萨达姆的情报错误表示遗憾，这只不过是将责难从政府推卸到了情报机构头上。	While he has publicly regretted the errors in British intelligence about Saddam Hussein, that is merely a way of shifting the blame from the government to the intelligence services.
这，以及大肆宣传的边境墙，将导致未来劳动力供给减少，从而抑制经济增长，特别是在美国人口持续老龄化、退出劳动力的情况下。	This, along with the much-ballyhooed border wall, will cut future labor supply, and thus economic growth, especially as the American population continues to age and drop out of the labor force.
开罗—最近，我作为美国商务部贸易代表团的一员访问了约旦和埃及，我震惊地发现，这一周边区域具有成为尖端医学主要枢纽的潜力。	CAIRO – On a recent visit to Jordan and Egypt, as part of a trade mission led by the United States Department of Commerce, I was struck by the potential for the surrounding region to become a major hub for cutting-edge medicine.
同时，我们正在推动我们历史上最为复杂的维和行动，给几十万流离失所的人提供食物和保护，并且在利比亚鼓励困难的和平谈判。	Meanwhile, we are pushing ahead with one of the most complex peacekeeping operations in our history, feeding and protecting hundreds of thousands of displaced people, and sponsoring difficult peace negotiations in Libya.
拜便利的国际旅行所赐，近几年来，登革热、基孔肯亚病和寨卡病毒都能搭顺风车自东而西，在美洲和加勒比地区造成大规模爆发。	It was thanks to easy international travel that in recent years the dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses were all able to hitch a ride from east to west, causing massive outbreaks in the Americas and Caribbean.
如果这些措施不能满足他的选民，特朗普还有最后一招，也是罗马皇帝和其他独裁者在国内困难时期经常动用的选项。	And if these measures do not satisfy his base, Trump will still have one last option, long used by Roman emperors and other assorted dictators during times of domestic difficulty.
目前，沙特王国的基本政治安排取决于皇室和企业的联盟，它们能自由进口劳动力，并确保公民获得公共部门岗位。	As it stands, the Kingdom’s underlying political settlement depends on the royal family’s alliances with businesses, which have a free hand to import labor, and guaranteed public-sector jobs for citizens.
但对法国人来说，真正重要的是马克龙如何管理国内问题。 法国存在大量国内问题，比如全国铁路工人大罢工。	But for the French, what really matters is Macron’s management of domestic problems, of which there are many, not least rolling strikes by railway workers across the country.
2009年时希腊预算赤字相当于GDP的15 ％ ； 参与国际货币基金组织项目后的2010年赤字有所下降，但仅跌至11 ％ 。	In 2009, the Greek budget deficit was 15% of GDP; with an IMF program, the deficit fell in 2010, but only to 11% of GDP.
纽约—菲律宾的塔克洛班（Tacloban）成为近几年来因气候灾难而被毁的城市名单上的新名字。 这一名单包括新奥尔良、曼谷、莫斯科、纽约、北京、里约热内卢、太子港 … … 等等。	NEW YORK – Tacloban in the Philippines has now joined the growing list of cities – including New Orleans, Bangkok, Moscow, New York, Beijing, Rio de Janeiro, and Port-au-Prince, to name just a few – pummeled in recent years by climate catastrophes.
布达佩斯 — — 6月17日的希腊议会重新选举不过是自20世纪60年代以来困扰西方民主和开放社会的严重危机的最新症状而已。	BUDAPEST – The re-run of the Greek parliamentary election on June 17 is only the latest symptom of the most serious crisis to plague Western democracies and open societies since the 1960’s.
譬如在波兰，天主教和民族主义导致社会特别排斥共产主义（这肯定与战前捷克斯洛伐克的平等主义和社会民主主义精神背道而驰 ） 。	In Poland, for example, the prevailing mix of Catholicism and nationalism made society particularly resistant to communism (certainly in comparison with the egalitarian, social-democratic ethos of pre-war Czechoslovakia).
但如果布鲁塞尔的欧盟机构仅仅在长出一口气的同时一切照旧，不改革阻碍正常发挥职能的结构性问题，那么即使英国决定留下，最终结果也好不到哪去。	But a British decision to remain would be almost as bad, if the EU institutions in Brussels simply heaved a sigh of relief and returned to business-as-usual, leaving dysfunctional structures untouched.
著名的左翼退欧派，如哈佛大学的理查德·塔克（Richard Tuck ） ， 准备冒险镇压国际主义的兴起。	Distinguished Lexiteers, like Harvard’s Richard Tuck, are prepared to risk quashing this surge.
相反，只要2001年和2003年花费在减税计划中的一小部分钱，该体系基本能在未来75年保持根基稳定。	On the contrary, the system could almost surely be put on a solid footing for the next 75 years with a fraction of what was spent on the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.
绿色和平组织和其他反对使用转基因作物（GMO）的组织宣传反对引入可在人体内转换为维生素A的贝塔胡萝卜素。	Greenpeace, along with other organizations opposed to the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), has campaigned against the introduction of beta carotene, which is converted in the human body into vitamin A.
上述言论值得我们留意，要知道出于公众对不受控移民的强烈反对而令英国脱欧公投“脱”派得胜也仅仅不过是两年前的事而已。	This is notable, considering that it has been only two years since a widespread public backlash against uncontrolled immigration delivered a victory to “Leave” in the Brexit referendum.
一年前，一位德国法官判决宗教割礼是残忍行为，是强加给男孩的伤害，因此是非法的 — — 这一观点受到了很多媒体评论员的肯定。	A year ago, a German judge ruled that religious circumcision was a cruel practice that inflicted bodily harm on boys and was therefore illegal – a view supported by many commentators in the media.
如果决策者选择基于受内外竞争保护的大规模国家主导部门的模式，那么创新目标不可能实现，未来增长将受到消极影响。	If policymakers choose a model based on a large state-dominated sector protected from internal and external competition, innovation objectives are unlikely to be met, adversely affecting future growth.
在被特朗普和前白宫首席战略家及现任布莱巴特新闻网执行主席史蒂夫·班农一再攻击后，弗莱克可能甚至无法击败一名共和党的初选挑战者。	Having been targeted first by Trump, and then by former White House Chief Strategist and current Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, Flake might not even have defeated a Republican primary challenger.
但特朗普不是普通的美国总统，因此我们都有责任思考白宫的意识形态对我们本国传统民主和西方思维所造成的影响。	But Trump’s is no ordinary US presidency, so we all have a responsibility to consider the implications of the White House’s ideological about face from traditional democratic and Western thinking for our own countries.
除非债务国生产成本有所下降，否则增长就不可能复苏，而生产成本下降要么要求生产率的永久性大幅提高，要么要求真实工资下降，要么双管齐下。	Growth will not resume until production costs in the indebted countries decline, which requires either a substantial permanent increase in productivity, a reduction in real wages, or both.
这个问题的根源，正如Jim Mason和我在新近出版著作《我们的饮食方式》中所描绘的那样，在于工业化的农业拒绝给予动物一种甚至是最低水平的体面生活。	The problem, as Jim Mason and I describe in our recent book, The Way We Eat, is that industrial agriculture denies animals even a minimally decent life.
马德里 — — 上个月巴黎大屠杀后刚刚达成的共识似乎是唯有依靠地面入侵才能打败伊斯兰国（ISIS ） 。	MADRID – The general consensus emerging since last month’s carnage in Paris seems to be that the Islamic State (ISIS) can be defeated only by a ground invasion of its “state.”
在富豪资助者和愤怒的本土民粹主义者等各方势力的影响下，共和党沦为特朗普式敌意收购对象的时机已经成熟。	Pulled in different directions by plutocratic funders and angry nativist populists, the GOP became ripe for a Trump-style hostile takeover.
为将于哥本哈根举行的气候变化大会所进行的准备工作，正被彼此间的唇枪舌战所主导，甚至连被人们期望能带来奇迹的巴拉克·奥巴马总统，也被证明只不过是一个颇具才干的凡人而已；在他或许能使来年变得更好的期待中，奥巴马获得了诺贝尔和平奖；接下来，他肯定有的忙了。	Preparations for the climate change conference in Copenhagen are dominated by charges and recriminations. Even President Barack Obama, of whom miracles were expected, turns out to be no more than a very talented mortal.
针对认识不足的行动很可能造成一些抑郁病人被误诊为双相障碍。 这些病人往往焦虑、不安和/或易怒，并抱怨有失眠和“思绪澎湃”的症状。	The campaign against under-recognition has probably resulted in some anxious, agitated, and/or irritable depressed patients who complain of insomnia and “racing thoughts” being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder.
通过回国这一举动，他扭转了巴基斯坦的政治能动格局，也就是，与独裁者距离最远要比与其接近对其更具有价值。	In one move, he reversed the Pakistani political dynamic: being farthest from the dictator became more valuable than being closest to him.
新的政党也由此出现，1997年成立的区域委员会使得像莫拉莱斯这样具有强大地方根基的政治领袖在没有任何主要政党支持的情况下成功跻身于玻利维亚议会。	This led to the formation of new political parties, and the creation of regional councils in 1997 made it possible for leaders with strong local roots – like Morales – to reach Bolivia’s congress without any major party’s backing.
此外，该法案原本还可以提供一些平衡预算的刺激 — — 是那种可以不用增加政府负债就能促进经济活动水平的刺激。	Moreover, the AJA would have offered some balanced-budget stimulus – the kind of stimulus that would boost the level of economic activity without increasing the volume of government debt.
“想象一个倒置的金字塔 ， ” ���资银行家查尔斯·莫里斯写道 ， “ 堆积在实际产量上的要求越多，金字塔变得越不稳定 。 ”	“Think of an inverted pyramid,” writes investment banker Charles Morris. “The more claims are piled on top of real output, the more wobbly the pyramid becomes.”
与这些因素同样重要的是，欧洲的问题并不在已发生的事情，而在于未曾发生的事情 — — 成立共同的欧洲政府。	As important as all of these factors are, Europe’s problem is not what happened, but what did not happen: the creation of a common European government.
伊斯兰极端分子只占全球穆斯林人口的不到0.5 % ， 但他们的世界观主宰者媒体报道 — — 不光是对伊斯兰教的报道，也包括对中东政治发展的报道。	Islamic extremists comprise less than 0.5% of the global Muslim population, yet their worldview dominates media coverage not just of Islam, but also of political developments in the Middle East.
最近在伦敦举行的以支持巴勒斯坦政权改革以及与以色列恢复谈判为目的的国际会议，就是初级阶段的努力之一。	The recent international conference in London, aimed at supporting reforms in the Palestinian Authority and shoring up support for renewed negotiations with Israel, is one of those preliminary efforts.
商界喜欢前一篇文章，因为它将高管获得多少薪酬（争议话题）转移为应该获得多少薪酬（技术性更强、争议更少的问题 ） 。	Business loved the first paper, because it shifted the conversation from how much executives were paid (a very controversial topic) to how they should be paid (a more technical and less contentious issue).
印尼和马来西亚加起来占了世界棕榈油市场的85 % ， 两国已同意成立棕榈油生产国委员会（Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries）以协调标准、促进生产活动的环境可持续性。	Indonesia and Malaysia, which together account for 85% of the world palm oil market, have agreed to establish the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries, which will harmonize standards and promote environmentally sustainable production practices.
约10亿人口生活在高收入国家中，2010年的援助总额意味着他们人均贡献了27美元 — — 对他们来说算不了什么，但对最贫困人口来说足以救命。	With one billion people living in high-income countries, total aid in 2010 amounted to around $27 per person in the donor countries – a modest sum for them, but a life-saving one for the world’s poorest people.
联合国千年发展目标的核心内容 — — 扶贫主要是以国内生产总值的增长来衡量的，但是必须包括健康经济依靠的自然资本的可持续管理。	Poverty alleviation, central to the UN Millennium Development Goals, is largely measured in GDP growth, but must include sustainable management of the natural capital on which economic health depends.
自十八世纪末以来，非石油商品相对于制成品的价格曾先后出现过七到八次的上涨（确切的数目取决于波峰和波谷的定义。	Since the late eighteenth century, there have been seven or eight booms in non-oil commodity prices, relative to the price of manufactured goods. (The exact number depends on how peaks and troughs are defined.)
但1952—1954年后，发达经济体遵守“非显而易见 ” （ 美国）和“发明步骤 ” （ 欧洲）专利要件标准。	And yet, since the 1952-1954 period, advanced economies have adhered to the patentability criteria of “non-obviousness” (in the United States) and “inventive steps” (in Europe).
密克罗尼西亚联邦和构成瑙鲁协定缔约方 （PNA）的其他七个岛国也许在地图上看仅仅是一些小点，但他们所拥有的海洋面积却大于欧洲大陆，而且在渔业领域堪称全球强国。	FSM and the seven other island states that make up the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) may look like dots on the map, but they command an expanse of ocean greater than the size of Europe and are global powerhouses when it comes to fish.
美国、欧盟以及其它富裕国家进行农业改革的最大赢家是它们本国的纳税人和消费者，这些纳税人和消费者长期以来为他们的农民同胞获得的补贴和保护买单。	The big winners from farm reform in the US, the EU, and other rich countries would be their taxpayers and consumers, who have long paid for the subsidies and protections received by their farming compatriots.
不幸的是，默尔克的竞选从一开始就困难重重。 最近奥斯卡·拉方丹的极左翼党派加入竞争后，可能就必须建立基督教民主党和社会民主党的总体联盟。	Unfortunately, Merkel’s campaign is off to a rocky start, and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine’s extreme left-wing party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats.
实际上，可以想象，一旦代用货币贬值，这种双货币机制很难避免兑换成币值较低的可能性，这个想法最终以失败告终。	Indeed, it is hard to imagine how this dual-currency scheme could have avoided the consequences of converting to a weaker currency if the quasi-money had depreciated, as the idea’s current promoters intend.
此外，为了让披露压力变得更有效，选前辩论的一部分应该聚焦于预算方案，问题可以围绕国会预算办公室对具体细节如何反应来展开。	And, to make this pressure to disclose meaningful, part of one debate should focus on budget proposals, with the questions being structured around how the CBO has reacted to specifics.
相反，它以孤立的方式看待问题，并且因显然认为可以用慷慨陈词来取代战略思考的总统的领导，不知如何在全球大国形象和献身自由价值之间取得平衡。	Instead, it considers every issue separately, unsure about how to balance its role as a global power with its commitment to liberal values, and led by a president who apparently believes that soaring rhetoric is a substitute for strategic thinking.
帕斯卡利都在去年年底举行的News Xchange媒体会议上发言，说任期人们对她和其他女记者经常会遇到的暴力的关注是她的“责任 ” 。	Speaking at the News Xchange media conference late last year, Pascalidou described it as her “duty” to bring attention to the abuse she and other female journalists regularly endure.
美国先是在1994年试图用美朝框架协议来解决这个问题；但在双方随后的作为（以及不作为）让这一努力逐渐失效。	The United States first tried to resolve the issue back in 1994, with the US-North Korean Agreed Framework; but that effort gradually collapsed, owing to actions taken – and not taken – on both sides.
事实上，席卷欧洲的民族主义部分受到俄罗斯资助的极右翼政党的煽动，这些政党的崛起让欧洲无法形成针对难民危机的集体应对措施。	The nationalism sweeping Europe, indeed, has been partly fueled by Russian funding of far-right political parties, the rise of which has prevented Europe from crafting a collective response to the refugee crisis.
50多年来，人类时时刻刻都在战战兢兢地看着性命之所系的发丝，而政客却在为如何修复发丝的磨损而吵个不可开交。	For more than 50 years, humanity has warily eyed that lethal pendulum while statesmen debated how to mend its fraying cords.
事实上，恢复边境控制似乎是“安全戏院 ” （ security theater）的好例子。 安全戏院政策旨在让公众觉得政府正在做一些什么。	In fact, the reinstatement of border controls seems to be an example of “security theater” – a policy intended to make the public feel like something is being done.
即便采用了德国的利率，希腊也必须实现想当于GDP2%的年均财政盈余 — — 该要求依旧想当严苛，与该国目前的赤字水平也有相当距离。	Even with German-level interest rates, Greece would have to run a primary surplus of at least 2% of GDP – still quite large, and far from today’s deficit.
去年三月，外界传言说马利基很可能输掉大选，为此他断言如果自己输掉了大选，那么国家的安全就会受到威胁，因为只有他才能维持国家的秩序。	Last March, as rumors circulated that he was losing the vote, Maliki asserted that state security would be threatened if he lost, noting his responsibility to maintain order.
纽黑文—美国国会为了跨太平洋洋合作伙伴关系（ Trans-Pacific Partnership ，总统奥巴马的标志性贸易立法）而吵到不可开交隐显一个重大障碍。	NEW HAVEN – As the US Congress grapples with the ever-contentious Trans-Pacific Partnership – President Barack Obama’s signature trade legislation – a major stumbling block looms.
更平等地与美国工人及其家庭分享利润能够极大地有助于解决几十年来令人担忧的工资和中产阶级所得停滞不前的问题。	More equitable sharing of profits with America’s workers and their families would do much to address the worrisome stagnation of wages and middle-class incomes in recent decades.
结果是马斯特里赫特条约几乎墨迹未干，过去二十年来一直飙升的欧洲内部贸易和对欧盟机构的支持就开始走下坡路。	As a result, intra-European trade and support for European institutions, having soared in the previous two decades, began to decline practically before the ink on the Maastricht Treaty was dry.
2015年一份皮尤研究中心调查显示最不关心气候变化的三个国家是美国、澳大利亚和加拿大，而最关心的三个国家则是巴西、秘鲁和布基纳法索。	According to a 2015 Pew Research survey, the three countries where concern is the weakest are the US, Australia, and Canada, whereas the three in which it is the strongest are Brazil, Peru, and Burkina Faso.
纽约—特朗普执政的闹剧的核心是一位走极端的总统是否可以违背大部分美国人的意愿，实施走极端的政策日程。	NEW YORK – The drama of Donald Trump’s presidency has centered around whether an extremist president would be able to carry out an extremist policy agenda against the will of the majority of Americans.
2006年，在一场由曼谷中产阶级支持的没有流血军事政变中，他信被赶下台。 中产阶级的支持者，也就是所谓黄衫军（黄色代表着泰国王室。	He was removed from office in 2006, following a bloodless military coup that was supported by the Bangkok middle class, whose members took to the streets in yellow T-shirts (the color of the Thai monarchy).
这导致了绝望情绪的增长 — — 特别是男性 — — 表现为劳动力参与率的不断下降，而健康问题、药物滥用、自杀率上升和反政府情绪又加剧了这一情况。	This has contributed to a growing sense of hopelessness – particularly among men – which has manifested in rising non-participation in the workforce, aggravated health problems, drug abuse, elevated suicide rates, and anti-government sentiment.
马基雅维利还强调当领导人面临与吸引力的软实力的权衡时，胁迫和收买的硬实力的重要性 ， “ 受到爱戴取决于他的臣民，而受到畏惧取决于他自己 。 ”	Machiavelli also stressed the importance of the hard power of coercion and payment when a leader faces a tradeoff with the soft power of attraction, “since being loved depends upon his subjects, while his being feared depends upon himself.”
此外高油价会鼓励其他新增产量来源（最顺理成章的莫过于页岩油）从而抵消了有利的需求效应，甚至可能起到反效果。	Add to that the increased production from alternative sources (most consequentially, shale) that higher prices encouraged, and the beneficial demand effects are offset, if not overwhelmed.
如果有什么区别的话，最新的进展证明了印度长期以来与缅甸建立友好关系的政策是正确的，因为缅甸是一个在贸易、运输、能源及国防上对印度来说都具有战略及经济重要性的国家。	If anything, the latest developments vindicate India’s long-held policy of engaging with Myanmar, a country of major strategic and economic importance to it in terms of trade, transport, energy, and security.
为了确定伊朗军队合适的作用和能力 ， （ 像美中双方那样）在美国和伊朗军队间举行直接谈判可能比较适合。	To determine the appropriate role and capabilities of Iran’s military, direct talks between the US and Iranian militaries, like those the US has pursued with China, might be in order.
问题在于，环境保护和直接健康干预之间是否存在一个最优组合，可以令决策者同时实现两方面投资回报最大化。	The question is whether there is an optimal mix of environmental protection and direct health interventions on which policymakers can rely to maximize investment returns for both.
现在多拿出一点钱推行几年制义务教育远比未来数十年面对大批没有文化的成年工人所付出的社会代价更为合理。	It is far more rational to spend a little extra income now for a few years of schooling than face decades of social costs resulting from masses of uneducated adult workers!
基督教、王朝制度、文艺复兴、思想启蒙运动、民主和工业化造就了现在的欧洲人，但这些并未能塑造出一个欧洲化的土耳其。	Christianity, feudalism, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy, and industrialization have made us what we Europeans are, but they have not made Turks who they are.
西雅图 — — 加利福尼亚州或许是全世界最大最著名的科技中心，但培养新型创业企业的地方也不是非它莫属。	SEATTLE – California may be the world’s largest and best-known technology hub, but it is not alone in fostering innovative startups.
在这个两极分化的体系中，政党在经济政策的细节上有分歧，但总体上都认同民主价值、欧洲工程以及适应和管理全球化的需要，而不是全盘否定。	In this bi-polar system, the parties differed on the nuances of economic policy, but broadly agreed on democratic values, the European project, and the need to adapt to and manage globalization, rather than reject it wholesale.
但是，奥巴马政府对这样的现状仍然能所有作为 — — 例如，要求美联储将其最近提供给新加坡、韩国和巴西的货币互换协议对象扩大到其他发展中国家。	But the Obama administration can still help – for example, by asking the Federal Reserve to expand the currency swap arrangements that it recently offered to Singapore, South Korea, and Brazil to other developing countries.
但另一个趋势也是所有规模城市所共有的：人们倾向于构建自身周边的“村落 ” （ village ） 。	But another tendency is also consistent across cities of all sizes: people tend to build “villages” around themselves.
实际上，我们在危机后作出了的大量努力，但收效却甚微，银行比以前更没有竞争力，那些因为规模庞大而没法倒闭的银行变得规模更加庞大。	Indeed, the efforts to rescue them devoted so little thought to the kind of post-crisis financial system we want that we will end up with a banking system that is less competitive, with the large banks that were too big too fail even larger.
今天，这一数字达到了200 000，这离不开美国（通过其PEPFAR项目）和日内瓦全球基金的慷慨支持。	Today, that figure is 200,000, thanks in large measure to generous support from the United States (under its PEPFAR program) and the Global Fund in Geneva.
此外，以色列无法像过去所尝试的那样吞并约旦河西岸的战略性地区而将其余部分返还约旦；相反，它必须以一致的修约和土地交换为条件退回1967年边界。	Moreover, Israel could not, as it attempted to do in the past, annex strategic areas of the West Bank and return the rest to Jordan; instead, it would have to withdraw to the 1967 borders, with agreed modifications and land swaps.
在这样的背景下，如果特朗普现在拒绝承认伊核协议，就会破坏美国在控制另一场核威胁，也就是朝鲜威胁方面的可信度。	In this context, if Trump does decertify the Iran deal right now, it will undermine America’s credibility when it comes to reining in another nuclear threat: North Korea.
同样，过去只以完整核心家庭形象示人的方便食品和保险广告也开始改变，开始展现单身母亲慈爱地用汤匙舀起鲜美的肉丸，或者为保护子女而购买一份人寿保单的场景。	Likewise, advertisements for convenience food and insurance – which used to feature only intact nuclear families – have begun to showcase single mothers lovingly spooning out meatballs, or protectively buying a life-insurance policy.
中国的领土欲望就没有一个限度吗？ 还是说，中国认为自己已经重新成为天朝上国，全世界面对它都得卑躬屈膝？	Are there no limits, or does today’s China conceive of itself as a restored Middle Kingdom, to whom the entire world must kowtow?
反移民立场转变的惊人速度体现出大多数美国人其实最想要的就是一个合理的手段；他们希望自己的政治领袖能在这一事务上有所担当，而非躲躲藏藏。	The remarkable speed with which anti-immigration positions buckled indicates that what most Americans want, above all, is a rational approach; they want their political leaders to take responsibility for the issue, rather than running away from it.
因为其成员国涵盖了大多数温室气体排放大国；各成员国在组织内部形成的共识将大大有助于12月的哥本哈根世界气候变化会议取得成功。	Its members represent the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emissions; agreement among them at Pittsburgh would go a long way towards ensuring that December’s international Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen does not end in hot air.
但如果新兴经济体能抵抗住过度私人部门信贷增长的诱惑，那么为稳定本币而提高利率的做法就不会对经济造成太大威胁。	Had emerging economies resisted the temptation of excessive private-sector credit growth, raising interest rates in order to stabilize currencies would not pose a severe threat to economic performance.
尽管网络接入和数字设备已经在中东和北非地区普遍存在，但它们被用于访问社交媒体，而不是开办新企业或雇用工人。	Although Internet connectivity and digital devices have become ubiquitous in the MENA region, they are used for accessing social media, rather than for launching new enterprises or employing people.
尽管世界人口绝大多数增长将发生在最贫穷国家，但美国3.2亿多语言、多种族和多民族人口将有可能实现1亿左右的增长。	Whereas most of the world’s population increase will occur in its poorest countries, America’s multilingual, multiracial, and multinational population of 320 million will probably increase by around 100 million.
显然，这一技术未必有效，还面临实践挑战，有可能导致未来泄露从而造成巨大的社会和环境后果，这些都无关紧要。	It is apparently irrelevant that such technology might not work, is riddled with practical challenges, and carries the risk of future leakage, which would have major social and environmental consequences.
穆沙拉夫再次鲁莽地宣布全国进入紧急状态，而当时最高法院的裁决是让乔杜里恢复原职。 这次，穆沙拉夫对原本已经经历人事调整的司法部再次洗牌，于是再次把乔杜里撤职。	Musharraf withdrew the emergency and restored the constitution, but a few days later Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Rawalpindi after she addressed a large election rally.
而且，在一个从毒品到传染病和恐怖主义等等越来越容易渗透过边界的世界里，美国必须动员国际合作来解决共同面对的威胁和挑战。	And, in a world where borders are becoming increasingly porous to everything from drugs to infectious diseases to terrorism, America must mobilize international coalitions to address shared threats and challenges.
OAS秘书长因苏尔萨（José Miguel Insulza）作了题为《美洲的毒品问题 》 （ The Drug Problem in the Americas）的报告，之所以作这个报告，是应美洲各国首脑在去年哥伦比亚卡塔赫纳美洲峰会上提出的要求。	The OAS Secretary General, José Miguel Insulza, presented a report entitled “The Drug Problem in the Americas,” which had been requested by the region’s heads of state when they met at last year’s Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia.
一对针对孟加拉穆斯林移民群体的野蛮大屠杀 — — 其中一次于1983年杀害了阿萨姆邦内利村和其他村的约3，000名穆斯林民众，暴露了这次危机已经造成了多么严重的后果。	A pair of savage massacres of Bengali Muslim migrant groups – one of which killed some 3,000 in the Assamese village of Nellie and other villages in 1983 – exposed the depth of the crisis.
蒂勒森宣称中国在亚太地区的扩张主义“类似于俄罗斯从乌克兰吞并克里米亚 ” — —这是对奥巴马坐视这两个问题发生的一种隐晦的批评。	China’s expansionism in the region, Tillerson asserted, was “akin to Russia’s taking Crimea” from Ukraine – an implicit criticism of Obama for allowing the two developments.
事实上，尽管怀有良好初衷的立法者和非政府组织做出了很大的努力，但每天仍有成千上万吨塑料废物进入环境，特别是海洋。	The fact is that, despite the best efforts of well-intentioned lawmakers and nongovernmental organizations, thousands of tons of plastic waste are still entering the environment, particularly the oceans, every day.
七个西欧国家（量最大的是德国）占据了欧盟总用气量的80 ％ ， 且都具备极高的能源利用率和高效可再生能源项目。	Just seven West European countries (Germany being the biggest) account for some 80% of total EU gas consumption, and all have strong energy-efficiency and renewable-energy programs.
尽管这样的策略很少成功 — — 布雷维克被判入狱21年 — — 但会被广为报道，在公众脑海中形成犯罪与精神病之间的关联。	Although this approach is rarely successful – Breivik received a 21-year sentence – it is widely reported, linking crime to mental illness in the minds of the public.
首先，全球经济的可贸易部门 — — 在该部门，经济活动和就业岗位的竞争是直接的 — — 占经济的总比重增加了；对于个体国家来说也是如此。	First, the tradable part of the global economy – where competition for economic activity and jobs is direct – is becoming a larger share of the whole; the same is true of individual economies.
但是，瑞典的特点还是高福利依赖，大约23％工作年龄的人口在最近几年中依靠不同形式的政府福利生活，这些福利包括临时和永久性残疾福利。	However, Sweden is still characterized by high welfare dependency, with about 23% of working-age people in recent years living on various types of government benefits, including temporary and permanent disability payments.
而实际上，百事公司以其诸如贵格麦片和强化成分的Tropicana果汁等符合FDA健益要求的产品占据了该市场25%的份额。	In fact, PepsiCo holds a 25% share of the market with products like Quaker cereals and fortified Tropicana juices, which qualify for FDA-approved health claims.
SDG将在2030年实现，内容包括消灭极端贫困和饥饿、降低各国内部和各国之间的不平等性，以及确保地球的可持续未来。	The SDGs aim to eliminate extreme poverty and hunger, reduce inequalities within and between countries, and ensure a sustainable future for our planet.
但是，伊朗政权与美国恢复邦交的可能仍然是中东地区的一大关注点，因为这意味着伊朗实力的增强，而与此同时，美国正在退出该地区。	Nonetheless, the regime’s possible rapprochement with the United States remains a source of concern in the Middle East, because it would empower Iran at a time when the US is gradually disengaging from the region.
事实上该项目甚至有可能被逆转，因为英国脱欧的举措可能会破坏和分裂欧洲现在拥有的一个运作良好的资本市场 — — 伦敦，欧洲公司从市场中筹集的大部分资金都是由该地经手的。	Indeed, the project may even have gone into reverse, as Brexit threatens to disrupt and divide the one well-functioning capital market Europe now possesses: London, which accounts for the majority of the market finance raised for European companies.
就这样，两者之间的边境变成了不过是地图上的一条线：没有栅栏，没有通关站，也没有隔离标志显示从一国迈入了另一国。	Just like that, the border between them was little more than a line on the map: there were no barriers, customs posts, or other divisive symbols to show where one country ended and the other began.
选举反而应该是全面关系正常化进程的一部分：它们既不应该是达成协议的障碍，也不应该是一个不是问题的问题。	Elections must instead be part of a comprehensive process of normalization: they should neither be a deal-breaker nor a non-issue.
它们的诉讼战略利用了标准的契约条款（称为平权条款 ） ， 该条款的本意是确保所有债权人得到平等对待。	Their litigation strategy took advantage of a standard contractual clause (called pari passu) intended to ensure that all claimants are treated equally.
高盛公司最新研究称，据估算，法国价格水平必须较欧元平均水平下跌20 % — —即实际贬值 — — 才能让法国重新获得欧元区内的竞争力。	According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs, the country’s price level must drop by an estimated 20% vis-à-vis the euro average – that is, depreciate in real terms – if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone.
这一急转直下可以从一份最近作为英国奇尔科特调查（Chilcot Inquiry）的一部分被披露的备忘录中一窥端倪。 该备忘录由英国前首相布莱尔写给美国前总统小布什，时间在伊拉克战争前夕。	The slippery slope is exposed in a memo – recently disclosed as part of the UK’s Chilcot Inquiry – written by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to former US President George W. Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war.
在印尼，10月开始执政的佐科维继承的是长期存在的燃料补贴，规模高达每年210亿美元（相当于政府支出的20 % ） ，已令国家不堪重负。	In Indonesia, when Jokowi takes office in October, he will inherit a long history of fuel subsidies that, at $21 billion a year (up to 20% of government spending), the country can no longer afford.
当经济不平等性演变为政治不平等性时 — — 美国大部分地区就是如此 — — 政府却没有关注底层人民的需要。	When economic inequality translates into political inequality – as it has in large parts of the US – governments pay little attention to the needs of those at the bottom.
与匈牙利总理欧尔班和已故的委内瑞拉总统查韦斯等其他民粹主义领导人一样，埃尔多安的选举承诺和他的执政表现之间的一致性一直是个谜。	As with other populist leaders, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán or the late Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, reconciling Erdoğan’s electoral promises and his performance in office is a puzzle.
如果哈马斯要在此次战争中幸存下来，它必须证明其抵抗在加沙边境地带，特别是在拉法（Rafah ） ， 形成了一个永久性的通路。	If Hamas is to survive the war, it must demonstrate that its resistance resulted in a permanent opening of Gaza’s border crossings, especially in Rafah.
在中国和其他现存的亚洲独裁国家中，人们、甚至那些自诩为“自由派”人士已经惯于争辩说民主可能对欧美国家是好事，但是它并不适用于亚洲传统。	In China, and other remaining areas of Asian authoritarianism, it has become customary, even among some self-professed “liberals,” to argue that democracy may be fine for Europeans and Americans, but is unsuited to Asian conditions.
这场危机提醒我们每个人对他人的亏欠，并揭示了一个我们很快忘却的道德真相：富人比穷人更能从与社会其他成员的合作中所获得利益。	The crisis reminds us what each person owes to others, highlighting an ethical truth that we were quick to forget: the rich benefit more than the poor from their cooperation with other members of society.
但特朗普在选战期间称之为“骗局 ” ， 并选择否认气候变化的斯科特·普鲁伊特（Scott Pruitt）领导美国环境保护署，而普鲁伊特在担任油气生产州俄克拉荷马州州长时经常与美国环境保护署打官司。	Yet Trump branded it a “hoax” during the campaign, and has picked a climate-change denier, Scott Pruitt, to head the US Environmental Protection Agency, which Pruitt, the attorney general of oil- and gas-producing Oklahoma, has frequently sued.
这些影响对于这个星球上生活最贫困的那些人群所带来的打击显然最大，尽管这些“生活在底层的十亿人口”已经承受了疾病、贫困、战争冲突和营养不良等所带来的沉重负担。	These impacts will clearly hit the planet’s worst-off inhabitants hardest: the “bottom billion” who already bear the heaviest burden of disease, poverty, conflict and malnutrition.
通过确立个人数据所有权，个性的具体概念可以得到强化，并推动那些使我们的文明实现繁荣的自由主义价值观。	By establishing personal data ownership, the very notion of individuality could be fortified, bolstering the liberal values that have made our civilization succeed.
通过“一带一路”计划，中国支持了占据战略要冲的发展中国家的基建项目，手段一般是给予这些国家的政府巨额贷款。	Through its $1 trillion “one belt, one road” initiative, China is supporting infrastructure projects in strategically located developing countries, often by extending huge loans to their governments.
到2016年将有5亿非洲人居住在中心城镇，100万或以上人口规模的城市预计将从2011年的52个增加到65个（与欧洲持平，比印度和北美更多 ） 。	By 2016, more than 500 million Africans will live in urban centers, and the number of cities with more than one million people is expected to reach 65, up from 52 in 2011 (on par with Europe and higher than India and North America).
发自加拿大安大略省伦敦市 — — 人类在多种癌症的治疗方面都取得了进展，而病人的存活期也不断延长，这有赖于两方面的研究：癌症的早期诊断，以及更有效且毒性更低的治疗方法。	LONDON, ONTARIO – Progress is being made against many types of cancer, with more patients surviving longer, thanks to research on two fronts: improved methods for earlier detection, and development of therapies that are more effective and less toxic.
不出所料，上述变化激起了强化“民族主权”的要求，而民粹主义政党，如希腊新当选的激进左翼联盟，已经利用这样的变化取得了选举的成功。	"Not surprisingly, that change has fueled demands for more “national sovereignty,"" which populist parties, such as Greece's newly elected Syriza, have translated into electoral success."
但每个国家的意见领袖以及那些闭塞者的亲戚朋友却在关注，而他们的影响力可以营造一种令每个人都不太舒服的气氛。	But opinion leaders, and friends and relatives of the least informed in each country, were following it, and their influence can create an atmosphere that makes everyone less willing to spend.
和个人品味不同 — — 个人品味可以轻易改变，无法提供通往快乐或美德之路 — — 职责可以通过所有人类所共有的逻辑机制领会。	Unlike personal tastes, which are fickle and offer no sure path to happiness or virtue, duties can be discerned by a logical mechanism common to all humans.
西方和许多阿拉伯政府雇用成百上千人劝阻可能的激进分子，但却并不十分明白这些意识形态所满足的心理需求。	Western and many Arab governments employ hundreds of people to dissuade would-be radicals, without a clear understanding of the psychological needs these ideologies serve.
只要是由人来做界面的工作 — — 比如GPS和汽车之间、不同语言的文档之间、食材和菜肴之间，或症候和对应疾病之间 — — 现在都有危险。	Any job in which people serve as an interface – between, say, a GPS and a car, documents in different languages, ingredients and a finished dish, or symptoms and a corresponding disease – is now at risk.
在与印度的双边关系方面，中国的焦点从其宣称拥有主权的印度北部阿鲁纳恰尔邦（即中国藏南地区）延伸到查漠和克什米尔地区的动向也引起了广泛忧虑。	In its bilateral relations with India, China’s shift in focus from its claims on the Northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh to Jammu and Kashmir is enormously worrisome.
这座核电站的设计和位于新泻的世界最大核电站柏崎刈羽同样坚固，而后者经受住了2007年7月中越近海地震（里氏6.8级）的考验。	The facility’s robust design is similar to that of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, the world’s largest, in Niigata, which was unscathed by the Chūetsu offshore earthquake (measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale) in July 2007.
此外，他们提出的措施将进一步降低欧洲国家间的利息差，维持资产价格泡沫，破坏资本市场的配置作用，从而加剧欧洲公共债务问题。	Moreover, the proposed measures would compound Europe’s public-debt problems by reducing interest-rate spreads among countries even further, sustaining asset-price bubbles, and destroying the capital market’s allocative role.
而在这方面我的姨妈阿纳苏亚就是我最重要的榜样，她放弃了去获取职场上的那些所谓成就并把精力放在了家庭上。	My aunt Anasuya, who is one of my most important role models, delayed conventionally defined achievements in the professional world as she focused on raising a family.
尽管经济开放整体上有利于体征经济，但显然也需要确保收益更加平等地分配，或至少不会对某些群体造成无差别伤害。	While economic openness boosts economies as a whole, there is an obvious need to ensure that the benefits are more equitably distributed or, at least, that some groups are not inordinately hurt by it.
这意味着应该根据负担，而不是普遍性，来配置资源，比如（特别是）并发症（即两种或以上病症在同一患者身上出现）的增加情况。	That means channeling resources according to burden rather than according to prevalence, particularly as co-morbidity (two or more diseases in the same patient) increases.
今年两起最大的政治冲击 — — 英国退欧和特朗普当选 — — 发生在最热烈地拥抱新自由主义经济学的国家，这绝不是巧合。	It is surely no coincidence that the two biggest political shocks of the year – Brexit and the election of Trump – have come in the two countries that most fervently embraced neoliberal economics.
增长尽管不如过去三十年那么快，但仍相对强势。 中国外汇资产头寸以及中央政府和家庭部门资产负债表都很健康。	Growth, while slower than in the last three decades, remains relatively strong, as does China’s foreign-asset position and its central-government and household-sector balance sheets.
亚洲席位不足严重威胁到联合国的合法性，这一问题随这个世界人口最多、也最具活力的地区全球地位不断攀升势必会不断增加。	Asia’s inadequate representation poses a serious threat to the UN’s legitimacy, which will only increase as the world’s most dynamic and populous region assumes an increasingly important global role.
当然，这些观点忽视了国家主权和民主等核心问题，特别是各国民选政府和议会决定本国税收和公共支出的特权。	Such ideas, of course, ignored the central issues of national sovereignty and democracy, and specifically the privilege of nationally elected governments and parliaments to determine their own taxes and public spending.
事实上，这导致了一段经济极其疲软的时期 — — 这也是苏联在从阿富汗撤军后仅仅三年便宣告解体的关键因素。	Indeed, it led to a period of extreme economic weakness – a key factor in the Soviet Union’s dissolution just three years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan.
对所有教育水平的员工来说，学习更多技术跟上由技术驱动的职业变化不需要那么多“坐在传统课堂”里的学习时间，而是需要员工培训形式更加灵活。	For workers at all educational levels, acquiring additional skills to stay abreast of technologically driven occupational changes will require less “seat-time” in traditional classrooms, and more dynamic forms of workforce training.
华盛顿 — — 伊朗总统马哈茂德·艾哈迈迪内贾德的首选继任者埃斯凡·拉希姆·马沙伊将不会参与6月14日的选举。	WASHINGTON, DC – Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s preferred successor, Esfandiar Rahim Mashai, will not be running in the June 14 election.
当伊朗处在十字路口时，就会出现广受欢迎的改革派候选人承诺要结束伊朗的国际孤立，而他的保守派对手则说伊朗的孤立是自力更生，并承诺给人民发放补贴。	When Iran is at a crossroads, a popular reformist candidate emerges, promising to end Iran’s international isolation, and his conservative rival defends Iran’s insularity as self-reliance and pledges handouts to the people.
诚然，贸易应该惠及所有国家、所有人，不管是欧洲和美国因为工厂关闭而受到损失的工人，还是陷在非洲和南非非正式经济中的自给农民（subsistence farmers ） 。	To be sure, trade must deliver for all countries and for all people, from factory workers suffering plant closures in Europe or the United States to subsistence farmers trapped in informal economies in Africa and South Asia.
从这个角度来看，发达国家与发展中国家在克服危机所要积极采纳的必要措施，就应该是建立起适应21世纪发展的基础设施。	Viewed in this way, an essential policy that developed and developing countries should pursue in overcoming the crisis is to build infrastructure suitable for the twenty-first century.
但任何人都不应怀疑恶劣的环境条件助长了狂热主义架构，目前这样的可怕局面正在中东和萨赫勒的大部分地区盛行。	But no one should doubt that the framework of fanaticism has been abetted by the dire environmental conditions that now prevail in much of the Middle East and the Sahel.
在2001年到2003年，当美国房屋市场和消费者支出对降低利率的激烈反应应该使这种争论变得没有意义的时候，对通货紧缩的担忧却不合时宜地增加了。	Deflation fears were mistakenly raised in 2001-2003, when the strong response of the US housing market and consumer spending to lower interest rates should have made the debate redundant.
血统和信仰的担心和对立、历史记忆以及外部大国的视而不见，这些因素组合在一起，几乎早就注定了再次动摇整个中东的宿命。	The combination of ethnic and sectarian fears and rivalries, historical memories, and willful blindness among outside powers seems almost predestined to destabilize the entire Middle East again.
在2008年选举中，美国人一方面对布什政府的伊拉克战争感到幻灭，在距正式投票还有两个月的时候又遭遇了金融危机。	In the 2008 election, Americans felt disillusioned by the Bush administration’s war in Iraq, and by the financial crisis that erupted two months before the vote.
发自开罗 — — 自从埃及前总统穆巴拉克辞职这几个月来，他的继任者不断通过与过往敌对势力接触的方式来释放外交政策转向的信号。	CAIRO – In the months since Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s resignation, his successors have signaled a shift in foreign policy by reaching out to former adversaries.
在儿童营养不足、无法获得足够医疗和教育的国家，环境风险也难免更高，穷孩子的生活前景远远比不上富孩子。	Inevitably, in countries where children have inadequate nutrition, insufficient access to health care and education, and higher exposure to environmental hazards, the children of the poor will have far different life prospects from those of the rich.
两位波罗的海国家的总统决定不出席，因为他们的东道主拒绝承认第二次世界大战结束的历史比战胜希特勒有着更多的内容：由于希特勒和斯大林在战争之初达成的交易，他们的民族不得不面对长达半个世纪的占领。	Two Baltic presidents have decided to stay home, because their hosts are not willing to concede that there is more to the history of WWII’s end than the victory over Hitler.
门罗主义（Monroe Doctrine）也许与当代国际法不相容；但所有强大到能够强行划定战略利益圈的国家都会这样做。	The Monroe Doctrine may be incompatible with contemporary international law; but all powers strong enough to enforce a strategic sphere of interest do so.
新法律除了有损于秘鲁“气候冠军 ” （ climate champion）的国际声誉 — — 一些政府官员一直在努力树立这一形象 — — 还破坏了秘鲁的自然环境和经济增长前景。	Beyond diminishing Peru’s international credibility as a “climate champion” – an image that some members of the government have been attempting to cultivate – the law jeopardizes Peru’s natural environment and economic-growth prospects.
但不管最后人选是谁，IMF，世界银行和国际社会都必须重申他们对公开透明程序的承诺 — — 并思考如何改善这一程序。	Whatever the outcome, the IMF, the World Bank, and the international community need to reaffirm their commitment to an open and transparent process – and ask how that process can be improved.
如果将所有私人银行存款都转成央行数字货币，那么传统银行将需要转型为“可贷资金中介机构 ” ， 通过借入长期资金来为抵押贷款等长期贷款提供资金。	If all private bank deposits were to be moved into CBDCs, then traditional banks would need to become “loanable funds intermediaries,” borrowing long-term funds to finance long-term loans such as mortgages.
首先，该协议必须明确定义相关案例 — — 既不能过于广义，也不能过于狭义 — — 并构建在现成的保护责任基础上。	First, the agreement would have to define the relevant cases clearly – neither too widely nor too narrowly – and build on well-established R2P language.
因此有理由相信是得到提升的推理能力使我们得以避免受到自己本性中更冲动因素的影响，而也正是这些因素引发了暴力。	So there are grounds to believe that our improved reasoning abilities have enabled us to reduce the influence of those more impulsive elements of our nature that lead to violence.
这也是曾经毫无例外地反对移民的工会如今也开始更多地支持能让未登记工人获得合法身份、创造更多移民途径的措施了的原因。	This is one reason why labor unions, which once opposed immigration across the board, are now far more supportive of measures that would legalize undocumented workers and create more pathways for migration.
因此，出于战略原因，许多企业放弃了法律保护，而是通过不断发布软件更新巩固市场主宰地位，它们将这些更新用作默认的壁垒，令竞争对手难以打破。	So, for strategic reasons, many firms forego legal protections, and consolidate a dominant market position by issuing ongoing software updates that, by default, serve as barriers that are difficult for competitors to breach.
例如，在数字技术和软件领域，新进步的孕育周期要显著缩短，而且一般会以渐进的方式在此前的创新基础上递进，也就是说相关行业应当适用的专利期要短得多。	In digital technologies and software, for example, new advances have much shorter gestation periods and typically build on previous innovations in an incremental fashion, meaning that much shorter patent terms may be appropriate.
但是 — — 进一步大胆假设欧元区增长繁荣即将到来 — — 如果某些因素发生重大变化，从而强化这些增长动力呢？	But – to indulge further that outlandish notion of an impending eurozone growth surge – what if something changes significantly to strengthen those growth drivers?
这个孤岛状态虽然是对长期受苦受难的朝鲜人民的诅咒，而是制裁战略的一个优势，因为只需要一个国家出手就可以收到成果：中国。	That insularity is a curse for the long-suffering North Korean people, but an advantage for a sanction-based strategy, because only one country is needed to make it work: China.
同样，联合国决策过程中应更多考虑年轻人的意见 — — 这不能局限于家长式的马后炮，而应在某种程度上允许他们规划自己未来的蓝图。	Likewise, young people should be better included in UN decision-making – not simply as a paternalistic afterthought, but in a way that enables them to help shape their own future.
如今，让我们试将这个真实且正在进行的金融科技革命与已经存在了近十年且仍然只有一项应用（加密货币）的区块链应用记录进行比较。	Now, compare this real and ongoing fintech revolution with the record of blockchain, which has existed for almost a decade, and still has only one application: cryptocurrencies.
即使唐纳德·特朗普当选总统的噩梦被成功避免 — — 这种可能性越来越大 — — 美国也不再能够成为世界警察。	Even if the nightmare of a President Donald Trump is avoided, as appears increasingly likely, the United States can no longer be the world’s policeman.
东盟以及它的附属机构，如东盟地区论坛和东亚峰会，是推动亚洲合作的重要力量，在这方面，安全也是推动合作的重要因素。	ASEAN, together with its affiliated bodies such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit, is the driving force behind the intensification of Asian cooperation, in which security, too, is a factor.
）他坚持认为，2009年赤字增加的不够，因此无法降低高失业；而2010年以降，赤字更是出现了危险的快速减少之势。	Deficits were not increased enough in 2009 to escape from high unemployment, he insisted, and were falling dangerously fast after 2010.
事实上，中国在努力使自己成为贸易大动脉的主宰者，同时煽动与不少邻国的领土和领海纠纷，以此改变亚洲的地缘政治版图。	Indeed, by working to establish its dominance along major trade arteries, while instigating territorial and maritime disputes with several neighbors, China is attempting to redraw Asia's geopolitical map.
此外，全世界有2/5的人口都居住在离海岸线100公里以内的区域，因此寻找合适的海岸来建设或者扩大核项目都变得越来越难。	Moreover, with nearly two-fifths of the world’s population living within 100 kilometers of a coastline, finding suitable seaside sites for initiation or expansion of a nuclear-power program is no longer easy.
消费物价指数（CPI）增长率在1958—1995年间为3.5 % ， 而在随后的十年中下降到2.5 % 。	The consumer price index (CPI) rose at a 3.5% rate from 1985 to 1995, and then slowed to just 2.5% in the decade to 2005.
要改变巨船的航向 — — 就本文而言，就是美国经济 — — 需要很长时间，即使特朗普真的让国会通过了他的经济日程的一些方案，对于增长的影响也可能要到2018年才会感觉得到。	Altering the course of a giant ship – in this case, the US economy – takes a long time, and even if Trump ever does manage to get some of his economic agenda through the US Congress, the growth effects are not likely to be felt until well into 2018.
在英国，新政府在首相特雷莎·梅伊（Theresa May）的带领下已经放弃了在2020年之前消灭赤字的目标。	In the United Kingdom, the new government, led by Prime Minister Theresa May, has dropped the target of eliminating the deficit by the end of the decade.
生活在一个互相关联的大家庭里的70多岁的人成为一个母亲，比起住在自己家里又没有近亲或朋友住在附近的西方夫妇，要更容易被人接受。	Becoming a mother at 70 is more acceptable for someone living in a joint family than it would be for Western couples living in their own home without close relatives or friends nearby.
许多专家从未想过发达经济体会遭受大规模的金融危机，同样，专家现在也确信发达经济体可以没有通货膨胀危机。	Many of the same pundits who never imagined that advanced economies could have massive financial crises are now sure that advanced economies can never have inflation crises.
阿根廷总统克里斯蒂娜·费尔南德斯·基什内尔飞抵加拉加斯寄希望外界支持她打击所谓秃鹫基金低价购买该国主权债券并成功起诉要求全额支付的行动。	Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, arrived in Caracas hoping to rouse support in her fight against the so-called vulture funds that bought her country’s sovereign bonds on the cheap and have successfully sued for payment in full.
而接受这一目标的不仅仅是富裕国家：从泰国到哥斯达黎加再到卢旺达，医疗五花八门而资源有限的国家正在投入资金和政治资本，以实现全民医疗覆盖。	And it is not only rich countries that have embraced this goal: from Thailand to Costa Rica to Rwanda, countries with mixed health systems and limited resources have dedicated funds and political capital to making universal health care a reality.
新加坡 — — 飓风佛罗伦萨上周袭击了美国东南部，这一系列极端天气事件已经提升了人们对灾难准备的预期。	SINGAPORE – Hurricane Florence, which smashed into the southeastern United States last week, is the latest in a string of extreme weather events that has raised expectations for disaster preparedness.
这种活力会因为出于多种因素的相互间的不信任以及缺乏强有力的地区组织来帮助抑制竞争行为而带来不稳定的因素。	This dynamism could lead to instability, owing to multiple sources of mistrust and the lack of strong regional institutions to help manage rivalries.
有些人甚至担心说如果美国（错误地）认为人民币贬值是为了确保自身贸易优势，那么人民币贬值可能会加剧这场贸易战。	Some have even expressed concern that the falling renminbi could exacerbate that trade war, if it is (wrongly) perceived by the US to be a purposeful devaluation aimed at securing a trade advantage.
后来在2003年，马克·梅里茨（Marc Melitz）展示了贸易如何将资源从低生产率转移到高生产率企业。	Later, in 2003, Marc Melitz showed how trade could shift resources from low-productivity to high-productivity firms.
另一个体现基础研究协同性和意外性的经典例子是DNA重组技术的起源。 DNA重组技术是现代基因工程（有时也被称为“转基因 ” ， 简称GM）的鼻祖。	Another quintessential example of both the synergy and serendipity of basic research is the origin of recombinant DNA technology, the prototypical technique of modern genetic engineering (sometimes called “genetic modification,” or GM).
比如，巴西的游说团体已经在推动这一结果，向最高法院递交了诉状，要求保证妇女更大的生殖权利，包括安全合法地堕胎的权利。	Advocacy groups in Brazil, for example, are already pushing for such an outcome, submitting legal cases to the Supreme Court to secure greater reproductive rights for women, including the right to safe and legal abortion.
但随着一系列危机不断侵袭欧盟 — — 其中受灾最深的是希腊、爱尔兰、葡萄牙、西班牙和意大利 — — 这些动态一直在变化。	But as a series of crises have hit the EU – affecting most acutely Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy – these dynamics have been changing.
但这一标准叙事不论在政治上多么有吸引力 — — 可称之为经济不安全假说 — — 它终究没有很好地描述现实。	But, however politically appealing this standard account – call it the economic insecurity hypothesis – may be, it is a poor description of reality.
这意味着改变农村地区的措施必须针对这些制度因素（此外还要增进性别平等和捍卫法治 ） ， 同时也要向本地社区引入新技术。	This means that efforts to transform rural areas must target these institutional factors (along with improving gender equality and safeguarding the rule of law), while also introducing new technologies to local communities.
鉴于法国行政当局握有相当大的权力，包括解散国民议会，因此每五年举行一次的总统大选是法国最重要的活动。	Given the French executive’s considerable powers, including the authority to dissolve the National Assembly, the presidential election, held every five years, is France’s most important.
正如古代中国所谓的“受命于天 ” ： 帝王因为得到了“天”的旨意而进行统治，而当他们都被推翻的时候，人们就认为“天”已经收回成命了。	It is like the old Chinese concept of the “mandate of heaven”: emperors were said to rule because they had it, and when they were overthrown, it was because they had lost it.
汽车制造商又是美国制造业的主心骨，它推动着生产技术的进步。 而如果美国要在今后的“绿色”交通革命中成为世界领袖的话，就将需要这些领先的技术。	The automakers are also the backbone of American manufacturing, driving advances in manufacturing technology that will be needed if America is to be a world leader in the coming “green” transportation revolution.
点明这篇颇受争议的演讲的主旨的段落暗指美国城市中心骚乱，并引用维吉尔的诗句 ： “ 如同罗马人，我仿佛看见‘台伯河河水尽赤 ’ 。 ”	The passage giving his controversial speech its name alluded to inner city riots in the United States and invoked Virgil: “Like the Roman, I seem to see ‘the River Tiber foaming with much blood.’”
他接着夸耀恢复了“史上最严厉制裁 ” ， 好像已经敲响了联合全面行动计划（JCPOA，伊核协议的正式名称）的警钟。	He went on to boast the return of “the most biting sanctions ever imposed,” as if sounding the death knell of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the deal is officially known.
美国前国家安全顾问兹比格涅夫•布热津斯基写道没有乌克兰的俄罗斯“不再成其为帝国，但俄罗斯一旦收买并收服乌克兰，那就自然而然恢复了帝国的身份 。 ”	Russia without Ukraine, former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote, “ceases to be an empire, but Russia with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire.”
虽然许多行业的利润有所反弹，但由于现金囤积和金融化程度提高的共同作用，同时股票回购 — — 以提振股票价格以及相应的股票期权 — — 也创下历史新高，投资仍然疲弱。	While profits have bounced back in many sectors, investment remains weak, owing to a combination of cash hoarding and increasing financialization, with share buybacks – to boost stock prices and hence stock options – also at record highs.
没有哪项技术可以像热带雨林那样实现有效碳存储，拯救和恢复热带雨林提供了最廉价的大规模碳减排或碳捕获形式，同时还能带来一系列额外的环境和社会效益。	No technology is as effective at storing carbon as tropical forests, and saving and restoring them offers one of the cheapest large-scale forms of emissions abatement or capture, while providing a host of other environmental and social benefits.
的确，Robert Schuman曾宣称“欧洲的建立决不会是一日之功，也不会是某项总体设计的一部分。	Indeed, Robert Schuman once declared that “Europe will not be built in a day, nor as part of an overall design.
这或许是个很大的“如果 ” ， 尤其考虑到反欧派别造成的最大威胁不在于他们所赢得的议席数量，而在于对主流政治造成的影响。	That may be a big “if,” especially given that the greatest threat posed by anti-European parties consists not in the number of seats they win, but rather in their ability to influence the political mainstream.
金墉的声明是非常正确的，衡量同性恋厌恶的经济成本的研究已经开始，探索法律和社会观念排斥同性关系国家的反同性恋情绪与贫困的关系。	Kim is exactly right, and research has started measuring the economic costs of homophobia by exploring links between anti-gay sentiment and poverty in countries where laws and social attitudes proscribe same-sex relationships.
但尽管这种逻辑似乎很有说服力，巴西的经济腾飞并没有证明这一逻辑：法庭和合同方面的根本提高并没有在金融和经济增长之前出现，甚至金融和经济的增长并没有伴随着这两方面的提高。	But, compelling as this logic seems, Brazil’s rise does not confirm it: financial and economic growth was not preceded by – or even accompanied by – fundamental improvements in courts and contracts.
虽然发展中国家的快速发展一直是商品价格上涨的一个重要因素，但这种局势的绝大部分是他们自己也无法控制的。	While rapid growth in developing countries has been an important factor in the rising commodity prices, much of this is beyond their control.
即便有一家中央银行辩解说“没有人能够预计到这些困难 ” ， 也只是打动了很少一些听众，也许是因为坐在那儿的几个人像我一样在过去几年一直明确地警告即将面临的困难。	Even the plea of one of central banker that “no one could have predicted the problems” moved few in the audience – perhaps because several people sitting there had, like me, explicitly warned about the impending problem in previous years.
当欧元区政府果断采取干预措施时，大部分法国和德国银行早已亏本脱手了所持有的希腊债务，把它们卖给了对冲基金和其他风险偏好更大的投资者。	By the time the eurozone governments intervened decisively, most French and German banks had largely unloaded their holdings at a loss to hedge funds and other investors with a greater appetite for risk.
但是，一些经济学家并不把所有这些因素视为退出非常规货币政策的理由，反而建议欧洲央行和日本银行采取更加夸张的政策：所谓的“直升机撒钱 ” 。	Instead of viewing all of this as motivation to back away from unconventional monetary policy, however, some economists are recommending that the ECB and the BOJ pursue an even more extraordinary policy: so-called “helicopter drops.”
地缘政治关系恶化增强了这一周期性波动，因为美元代表安全与稳定资产，特别是在美联储表态将加快利率正常化的背景下。	Rising geopolitical tensions reinforce the cycle, as the dollar represents stability, especially at a time when the US Federal Reserve is signaling faster normalization of interest rates.
交易者突然想起，地缘政治事件也可以增加石油供给，而不只是减少石油供给 — — 而在未来几年中还可能有进一步的地缘政治驱动的供给刺激。	Traders suddenly recalled that geopolitical events can increase oil supplies, not just reduce them – and that further geopolitics-driven supply boosts are likely in the years ahead.
毕竟，中国是可能有能力让全球经济复苏全力启动的国家；但其自身经济增长的基础正在日益表现出吃紧的信号。	After all, China is the one country that might be able to jump-start the sputtering global economy’s recovery; and yet its own economic growth is based on a foundation that is increasingly showing signs of strain.
因此有理由将阿萨德定为战犯，他因此应当在国际刑事法庭（ICC）受到起诉 — — 顺带说一句，美国从来没有批准过这项议定书。	So there are good reasons to treat Assad as a war criminal, in which case he should be indicted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) – established, incidentally, by a treaty that the US has never ratified.
但是，当我问英国石油的一位董事为何英国石油宁可继续冒险进行深水钻井，而不去投资替代能源时，他回答说 ： “ 我们是钻井企业，这是我们的专长。	Yet, as one BP director replied when I asked why his company continued to risk deep-water drilling, instead of investing in alternative energy: “We are a drilling business, and that is our expertise.
虽然数字并不足以显示各方行为的残酷，但列举数字已经成为一种礼节性的需求：超过100,000人丧生、230万登记难民和超过400万民众在国内流离失所（有人估计国内流离失所的民众甚至高达650万人 ） 。	Although figures do not convey the cruelty by all sides, it has become de rigueur to cite the numbers: more than 100,000 dead, 2.3 million refugees, and four million people internally displaced.
越来越多的巴勒斯坦人领教了仍被称为“和平进程”的东西的无能，他们认为法塔赫的死对头哈马斯 — — 统治加沙的伊斯兰运动 — — 更能打破当前僵局。	More and more Palestinians, fed up with the futility of what is still called the “peace process,” believe that Fatah’s fierce rival, Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules Gaza, has more effective ways to break the current impasse.
特别是，他们反对欧洲央行购买危机受袭国政府债券的无限之承诺（用欧洲央行行长德拉吉的名言讲，就是“不惜一切代价 ” ） 。	In particular, they have objected to the ECB’s unlimited commitment (“whatever it takes,” in ECB President Mario Draghi’s famous phrase) to the purchase of crisis-hit countries’ government securities.
虽然威胁退出WTO即使作为一项谈判战略也没有任何意义，更不用说作为一项政策了，但这种状况仍然可能发生，并为美国经济和世界的影响带来灾难性的后果。	Threatening to leave the WTO makes no sense even as a negotiating strategy, let alone as a policy, but it could still happen. The consequences for the US economy and for the world could be calamitous.
由于国家安全与繁荣如今依赖于网络空间的安全保障，因此对网络犯罪加以有效回击一事，必须成为国际社会的优先关注；如若不然，则网络空间将蜕变为新的全球共同战场。	With national security and prosperity now dependent on the safekeeping of cyberspace, cybercrime must be effectively countered as an international priority. If not, cyberspace will become the new global-commons battlefield.
此外，尽管目前全世界陆地保护面积约占总面积的13 % ， 但在17%植物物种最富集的面积中只有14%属于保护区的范畴。	Moreover, while some 13% of the world’s land area is currently protected, only 14% of the 17% that contains the most plant species fall within the protected areas.
4月11日，G-7外长在广岛宣布“所有国家都不应该进行核试爆，所有国家都应该毫不迟疑地签署并批准CTBT ” ， 这是一个良好的开端。	The G-7 foreign ministers’ declaration on April 11 in Hiroshima – “No state should conduct a nuclear test explosion and all states should sign and ratify the CTBT without delay” – is a good start.
在2008年3月份给联合国安理会的简报中，甘巴里报告说他对缅甸最近一次的访问“令人沮丧”并且承认没有取得任何实质性的进展。	"In his March 2008 briefing to the UN Security Council, Gambari reported that his most recent visit to the country was ""frustrating"" and acknowledged that no tangible progress was made."
Expedia、Yelp和TripAdvisor这样的企业提出谷歌搜索抢走了他们网站有价值的流量，导致他们的企业在竞争中陷入不劣势。	Companies like Expedia, Yelp, and TripAdvisor argue that Google searches are depriving their Web sites of valuable traffic, putting their businesses at a disadvantage.
埃塞俄比亚也面临着几十年来最严重的干旱，导致许多农作物歉收、由此造成的粮食短缺威胁着该国1/10左右的人口。	Ethiopia is also dealing with its worst drought in decades, which has already contributed to the failure of many crops, creating food shortages that now affect around a tenth of the population.
选战期间，克林顿常常援引第一夫人米歇尔·奥巴马的话 ： “ 身段放得越低 ， ” 她说 ， “ 形象变得越高 。 ”	During the campaign, Clinton often quoted First Lady Michelle Obama: “When they go low,” she would declare, “we go high.”
如果我们想要阻止全球气温上升、阻止气候危机，消费者和政府就必须采取更多行动建立、支持和增强有环境良心的生产商。	If we are to halt global temperature spikes and avert an ecological crisis, consumers and governments must do more to create, support, and strengthen environmentally conscious producers.
然而以股东价值为名实施的经营活动通常只有利于那些自身财富与公司利润关系密切的人，而且很可能实际上会损害许多股东的利益。	But actions taken in the name of shareholder value often benefit only those whose wealth is closely tied to the company’s profits, and may actually be harmful to many shareholders.
当蒙蒂在2011年11月就任总理时，五星运动和当时所谓的北方联盟的民调总和得票仍在10%以下；而今天，该数据已远超50 % 。	When Monti took office in November 2011, M5S and the Northern League (as it was then called) were polling below 10% combined; today, that figure is well above 50%.
虽然至少民主国家有能力在一定程度上对前三个问题进行自我修正，但寡头体制下经济和政治权力的集中趋势却能够自我强化。	Whereas the first three sources of concern are amenable to self-correction, at least in a democracy, the concentration of economic and political power in an oligarchy is self-reinforcing.
由于如今只有一小部分海外利润被汇回美国，因此即使将税收制度改为领土原则，美国政府也不会损失多少税收收入。	Because only a small share of overseas profits is now repatriated, the US government would lose very little tax revenue by shifting to a territorial system.
估计世界各地散落着约15，000枚核弹头，而销毁它们意味着向当权者说出真相 — — 而这些真相往往非常残酷。	There are an estimated 15,000 nuclear warheads scattered around the world, and eliminating them means speaking truth – and often hard truths – to power.
其成员甚至对于如何定义次级抵押贷款、如何计算危机发生时美国存在多少次级抵押贷款这样的问题都无法达成一致。	Its members could not agree even on how to define subprime mortgages and calculate how many such mortgages there were in the United States at the time of the crisis.
布什政府没有意识到这些人口和环境方面的挑战，8000亿的安全支出不会给阿富汗、巴基斯坦、苏丹和索马里带来灌溉，因此也无法带来和平。	The Bush administration fails to recognize these fundamental demographic and environmental challenges, that $800 billion of security spending won’t bring irrigation to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, and Somalia, and therefore won’t bring peace.
考虑到中国巨大且不断扩大的收入差距，以及农村大规模的隐性失业现象，很容易想象政局不稳的那一天，投资者们会争先恐后地逃走。	Considering China’s huge and growing income inequalities, and its massive disguised rural unemployment, it is easy to imagine a period of political instability that sends investors heading for the exits.
尽管希望兄弟会成为正常法律组织，而不是以自由正义党为掩护的阴暗网络的要求完全合法，但将政治活动犯罪化却超出了宪政民主的容忍限度。	While it is legitimate to demand that the Brotherhood become a regular legal organization, rather than a shadowy network fronted by the Freedom and Justice Party, criminalization of political activity has no place in a constitutional democracy.
借款者被诱使办理超出其承受能力的抵押贷款；企业自身资产被恶意剥离；会计师误导投资者；金融顾问编造出不知从何而来的富人；而媒体则鼓动那些夸张的宣言。	Borrowers are lured into unsuitable mortgages; firms are stripped of their assets; accountants mislead investors; financial advisers spin narratives of riches from nowhere; and the media promote extravagant claims.
在国际货币基金组织（IMF）几乎已丧失其起初作为世界性中央货币机构而存在的理由的情况下，世界经济正越来越受到来自对全球不平衡的动荡市场反应的威胁。	The world economy is increasingly threatened by volatile market reactions to global imbalances at a time when the IMF has largely lost its original raison d’être as the world’s central monetary institution.
在格里萨违约前，人们常常错误地假设主权债务偿付问题的解决方案应该通过分散化的谈判实现，不必有强大额法律框架。	Before the Griesafault, it was often mistakenly assumed that solutions to sovereign-debt repayment problems could be achieved through decentralized negotiations, without a strong legal framework.
有诸多重要问题需要解决，不仅包括北约使命与其行动的方向，还有跨大西洋安全合作的将来以及北约将要发挥的作用。	There are important questions to be addressed, not only about the direction of NATO’s missions and operations, but also about the future of transatlantic security cooperation and the role the Alliance will play.
此外，由于需求被压抑着，信用供给不足，而创业壁垒通常较高，因此企业创造高生产率岗位需要比平常耗费更长时间。	And, because demand is depressed, credit is in short supply, and barriers to enterprise are often high, it will take longer than usual for businesses to create more productive jobs.
他的支持者还包括白人至上论者：6月，特朗普得到了美国最大的新纳粹“新闻”网站The Daily Stormer的支持 。	It also includes white supremacists: in June Trump was endorsed by The Daily Stormer, America’s largest neo-Nazi “news” website.
俄罗斯GDP规模大约为美国的七分之一，而18,000美元的人均收入（以购买力平价衡量）大约为美国的三分之一。	Russia’s GDP is about one-seventh the size of America’s, and its per capita income (in purchasing-power-parity terms) of $18,000 is roughly one-third that of the US.
海洋废物每年要导致一百万海鸟和100,000海生哺乳动物（海豹、鲸鱼和海豚）因为溺水、窒息或饥饿而死去。	Marine debris causes the death by drowning, suffocation, or starvation of some one million seabirds and around 100,000 marine mammals (seals, whales, and dolphins) every year, not to mention the hazard posed to shipping by sea junk.
类似地，印尼2012—2013年经常项目赤字占GDP的3 % ， 其恶化程度更加严重，因为2008—2011年期间该国经常项目处于盈余状态，平均为GDP的0.7 % 。	Similarly, Indonesia’s current-account deficit, at 3% of GDP in 2012-2013, represents an even sharper deterioration from surpluses that averaged 0.7% of GDP in 2008-2011.
她可以主持与欧盟的“无协议”决裂 — — 这相当于宣布对欧盟发动经济战 — — 并且冒着再次引发2008年级别经济危机的风险，而且还要同时面对爱尔兰的边境动荡，这样的动荡可能重新导致“麻烦”的发生。	She could preside over a “No Deal” rupture with Europe – tantamount to a declaration of economic war against the EU – and risk a 2008-level economic crisis accompanied by a border upheaval in Ireland that could reignite the “Troubles.”
但据调查记者托马斯·摩尔在《致命药物》一书中的报道，在其使用高峰期，每年被这种药物夺去生命的美国人比越南战争中丧生的人还要多。	But, as the investigative journalist Thomas J. Moore reported in his book Deadly Medicine, at the peak of their use, these drugs were killing more Americans each year than were killed during the entire Vietnam War.
可恶评级可以成为软国际法的一部分，法庭可用它来裁定如何强制执行债务契约。 它也可以帮助确定哪些债券可以纳入新兴市场指数的计算。	Odiousness ratings could become part of soft international law, used by courts when deciding how to enforce debt contracts, and they could help determine which bonds are included in the calculation of emerging-market indexes.
欧洲仍存在于美国体内，只不过更多地存在于华盛顿政府和政治精英，而不是纽约金融和商业世界，尽管跨大西洋贸易对于欧洲和美国来说都具有根本重要性。	Europe still exists in the US, though probably more among the Washington administrative and political elite than within the world of New York finance and business, despite the fundamental importance of transatlantic trade for both economies.
在全球化的世界里，就像近年来爆发的SARS、埃博拉和寨卡病毒一样，一个国家的传染病暴发可能迅速演变成对其他地方卫生的严重威胁。	In a globalized world, an outbreak of infectious disease in one country could quickly evolve into a serious threat to health elsewhere, as has happened in recent years with SARS, Ebola, and Zika.
为了将利率向正确的方向调整，央行通常依赖于对那些不可观察变量（包括均衡实际利率自身，潜在产量，以及失业率趋势）的估算。	To steer rates in the right direction, central banks typically rely on estimates of unobserved variables, including the equilibrium real rate itself, potential output, and trend unemployment.
从这个意义上讲，与其只是保护老年人，不如去赋予他们权力，因为大多数发达经济体根本无法为这么一个超大型利益集团带来巨大的新利益。	In this sense, it is better to empower the elderly than simply to protect them. Most advanced economies simply cannot afford massive new benefits for an oversized interest group.
他们有着令人惊异的相似之处：出身平凡、克格勃背景、熟悉黑道、强健的心智与体格、对“人民公敌”的冷酷无情。	The similarities are striking: the modest social background, the KGB milieu, the criminal vocabulary, the mentality and physique, the mercilessness towards “enemies of the people.”
比如希腊和意大利就一直试图通过给零售现金使用额设定上限（分别为1500和1000欧元）来遏制现金使用。	For example, Greece and Italy have been trying to discourage cash use by capping retail cash purchases (at €1,500 and €1,000, respectively).
若采取互相承认，那么欧盟和美国将承认彼此的标准或合规评估程序，企业会在各种标准中选择不太苛刻的那种。	With mutual recognition, the EU and the US would accept each other’s standards or conformity-assessment procedures, allowing firms to adhere to the less stringent requirements in each area.
要理解由此造成的政治局面，可以想象一个田字格，四个象限分别由留欧和预算削减派、留欧和经济扩张派、脱欧和预算削减派以及脱欧和经济扩张派组成。	To see the resulting political terrain, imagine a two-by-two table, with the four quadrants occupied by Remainers and Budget Cutters; Remainers and Economic Expansionists; Brexiteers and Budget Cutters; and Brexiteers and Economic Expansionists.
明显的输家可能包括那些（或相信自己）受到移民竞争影响的本国劳动者，或者认为自身生活方式甚至身份定义受到威胁的公民。	Apparent losers may include domestic workers who are (or believe they are) affected by competition from migrants, or citizens who feel that their way of life or even identity is being threatened.
考虑到这些趋势，寻找更强健增长模式将需要更长的时间并且比很多人意识到的更为复杂 — — 尤其是世界经济轴心在远离不受限制的全球化和高杠杆水平之时。	Given these trends, the search for more robust growth models will take much longer and be more complicated than many recognize – especially as the world economy pivots away from unfettered globalization and high levels of leverage.
为了缓解对主权财富的可能的政治考虑的担忧，国际货币基金组织（IMF）在2008年组织26家主权财富基金 — — 其中超过30%来自中东 — — 制定了圣地亚哥原则。	To allay concerns over SWFs’ potential political considerations, the International Monetary Fund convened 26 SWFs – over 30% of them from the Middle East – in 2008 to develop the Santiago Principles.
影响的严重性取决于英国及其欧洲伙伴如何谈判棘手的分离问题，特别是自由贸易和金融畅通可以在多大程度上得到保留。	The severity of the effects will depend on how the UK and its European partners negotiate their tricky separation, particularly the extent to which free trade and financial passporting are upheld.
否认这一点的话 — — 就像以色列和阿拉伯领导人的惯常做法 — — 就会让血腥、破坏性和动摇性的可怕冲突的可能性变得更高，而发生这样的事情不符合所有各方的根本利益。	To argue otherwise, as Israeli and Arab leaders are wont to do, merely makes more likely a horrifically bloody, destructive, and destabilizing conflict that all parties have a fundamental interest in avoiding.
诚然，此结果代表着一个既震惊又历史性的失败：在第五共和国时期，戴高乐，密特朗，雅克. 希拉克这三位在任总统都连任两届。	Indeed, the result represents a stunning and historic defeat: during the Fifth Republic, three sitting presidents – Charles de Gaulle, Mitterrand, and Jacques Chirac – have been reelected after their first term in office.
我就这一问题与数名媒体业高管进行过交谈 — — 主要是男性媒体领导人 — — 大部分人听说自己的女同事们在数字世界面临着如此大的威胁后都惊呆了。	When I discussed this issue with several senior, predominantly male industry leaders, most were shocked to hear that their female colleagues felt so threatened in the digital space.
截止2035年，预计该病每年将造成发展中国家（其中大部分生活在撒哈拉以南非洲和南亚）的416，000名女性缓慢而痛苦地死去。	By 2035, the disease is expected to cause 416,000 women to die slowly and painfully every year – virtually all of them in developing countries (mostly Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia).
这就如邓小平所言，有一个好的制度，坏人做不出坏事，但没有一个好的制度，好人都做不出好事，甚至因而做出坏事来。	As Deng once said of China: “With a good system, even evil men cannot do evil. But without a good system, even good men cannot do good, but may be forced to do evil.”
这个国家可能已经经受了多年的暴力洗礼，但基督徒、逊尼派和什叶派似乎已经吸取了教训，不能把自己的观点强加在别人身上。	It may have taken years of violence, but Christians, Sunnis, and Shias seem to have internalized the lesson that they cannot impose their will on one another.
曾几何时我们只能沿边境区域集结坦克，现在却可以建设一套需要众多盟国贡献一系列高科技的复杂陆、海、空防御系统。	Where once we lined up tanks along borders, we are now building a complex system that requires a range of high-tech contributions from many allies – on land, at sea, and in the air.
美国网球粉丝观看网球比赛才不会管它是在哪里比，美国高尔夫球观众也不会因为锦标赛是在高尔夫球诞生地苏格兰举行而不看它。	US tennis fans watch tennis wherever it is played all over the world, and the US audience for golf does not plummet when a tournament is played in the sport’s birthplace, Scotland.
但现在我们又有巴西的总统选举，浑身散发着专治、反建制和反其他倾向的教科书式的民粹主义者贾伊尔·波索那罗在第二轮中取得了决定性的胜利。	But now we have Brazil’s presidential election, in which Jair Bolsonaro, who displays the authoritarian, anti-establishment, and anti-other tendencies of a textbook populist, won decisively in the second round.
2012年，金融崩溃让墨西哥制度革命党（Institutional Revolutionary Party）重新掌权，2013年，米歇尔·巴切莱特的左翼政党新多数党（Nueva Mayoría）在智利获胜。	Financial meltdown restored the Institutional Revolutionary Party to power in Mexico in 2012, and Michelle Bachelet’s leftist Nueva Mayoría party won in Chile in 2013.
哈佛医学院教授玛西亚·安吉尔（Marcia Angell）证明这笔融资在近几十年来的一些最具革命性的新药的开发中起到了关键作用。	Marcia Angell, a professor at Harvard Medical School, has shown that this financing played a crucial role in the development of some of the most revolutionary new drugs in recent decades.
答案不可避免地受到美国在1929年的经验的影响。 当时，美联储认为华尔街存在过度问题，因此收紧了货币政策，结果导致经济陷入大萧条。	Inevitably, the answers are colored by the United States’ experience in 1929, when the Fed tightened policy in response to what it perceived as excesses on Wall Street, only to plunge the economy into the Great Depression.
对也门来说，有效的政府干预也许遥不可及，但在其他中东和北非国家，政府干预是可行的 — — 事实上也是当务之急。	Effective government intervention may be a long way off in Yemen, but it is feasible – indeed, imperative – in other MENA countries.
但即使眼前的危机得到解决，美土关系 — — 以及更一般的西方-土耳其关系 — — 的结构性危机仍然存在。	But even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the structural crisis in US-Turkish relations – and Western-Turkish relations generally – will remain.
如果以表达出共同货币承诺的欧元区国家同意放弃个体国家席位，以货币联盟占据一个代表席位，则中国就将获得空间。	Space at the table for China could be obtained if the eurozone countries, signaling their commitment to the common currency, agreed to surrender their individual seats in exchange for one representing the entire monetary union.
我们也许可以达到2015年将肺结核感染率和死亡率在1990年水平的基础上下降一半的联合国千年发展目标。	We are likely to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of cutting TB prevalence and mortality in half by 2015, from 1990 levels.
例如，人们可以遵循亚当·斯密的比较优势原理：欧洲的强项是国家，亚洲仍然依赖家庭，美国继续坚持个人善举。	One could follow, for example, Adam Smith’s principle of comparative advantage: what Europe does best is the state, while Asia still relies on the family and the US continues to focus on individual initiative.
非洲各国之间以及各国内部的本质性差异要求对消费者偏好以及对不同产品类别的承受能力取得更为深入细致的理解。	Substantial differences among and within Africa’s countries imply the need for a much deeper and finer-grained understanding of consumer preferences and affordability profiles by product category.
其中一个辅助性措施是让男性政治家承担更多照顾责任，从而使男女双方的竞争更为公平，同时体现出照顾家庭是所有人的首要任务。	One step that could help would be for male politicians to assume more care responsibilities, thereby making the playing field more level, while demonstrating that family is a high priority for everyone.
公司税率将从35%下降到20 % ， 资本利得（投资收益）税也将下调，不动产税将取消，还有其他有利于富人的变动。	It would lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, reduce the tax on capital gains (investment profits), eliminate the estate tax, and introduce other changes that benefit the wealthy.
比如，他在2013年的好战行为同时恶化了他与中国、韩国和美国的关系；而在最近的危机中，他所获得的只不过是韩国暂停了嘲弄性的广播喊话。	His bellicose behavior in 2013, for example, worsened his relationships with China, South Korea, and the United States simultaneously; and in the recent crisis, all he earned was a halt to mocking loudspeaker broadcasts.
这些参议员，以及他们的众议员同道，受到石油和天然气行业的指使。 石油天然气行业在2016年的选战中贡献了1亿美元献金，其中90%给了共和党候选人。	These senators, and their counterparts in the House of Representatives, are on the take of the oil and gas industry, which spent $100 million on campaign contributions in 2016, of which 90% went to Republican candidates.
没错，哈马斯最近似乎正考虑接受一个基于1967年边界划分的解决方案，但该组织的领袖和成员能否容忍这个方案都令人存疑。	True, Hamas has been indicating recently a readiness to contemplate a solution based on the 1967 borders, but it is doubtful that its leaders and members could live with the betrayal of the refugees.
此外，精英控制组以治疗为重点的研究已经找到了病毒变异较小区域的线索，该结果可以在很大程度上帮助疫苗研究者。	Meanwhile, cure-focused studies of elite controllers are yielding clues about regions of the virus that mutate less, which could hold important lessons for vaccine researchers.
在简短的获胜演讲中 — — 堪称魔法时刻 — — 奥巴马以实实在在但又近乎虔诚的方式庆祝了“民主的魔力 ” 。	In a few sentences of his victory speech – the space of a magic moment – Obama celebrated “the mystery of democracy” in a very concrete, but also nearly religious manner.
无论工党还是保守党哪一方赢得最多数量的议会席位，其构成必然会包括众多永远不可能同意其政策重点的英国选民。	Regardless of which party – Labour or Conservative – wins the largest number of seats in Parliament, its constituents would of course include many English voters, who would never agree to the SNP’s policy priorities.
但是，所有的事情都是相对的：德国的趋势增长率仅为1.1 % ， 而且自1995年以来一直是欧盟国家中增长最慢的国家。	But everything is relative: Germany’s trend growth rate is just 1.1%, and the country has been the slowest growing EU country since 1995.
在这样的环境下，全球现实政治的回归只能有利于俄罗斯而有损于美国，尽管美国在硬实力和软实力方面拥有大量优势。	In such a context, the return of global realpolitik can only benefit Russia and harm the US, despite America’s many advantages in terms of hard and soft power.
因为多国部队通常以地区联系或强大的双边关系为基础，他们为军事资源打上“欧洲”的印记，同时又可以确保战场效率。	As multinational forces that are built either on regional affiliations or strong bilateral relations, they bestow a “European” label on military resources while guaranteeing efficiency in the field.
在他的最后一次美联储理事会会议上，时任纽约联储主席蒂莫西·盖特纳（Timothy Geithner）对格林斯潘进行了如今看上去颇令人尴尬的高度赞扬，说格林斯潘的名誉在未来还会继续上升而不是下降。	At his final Board meeting, Timothy Geithner, then-President of the New York Fed, delivered what now seems an embarrassing encomium, saying that Greenspan’s stellar reputation was likely to grow, rather than diminish, in the future.
第三，促成此次危机的因素还包括：低利率、压缩风险利差、美国人的低储蓄的全球经济失衡的、消费量超过��量以及不断攀升的贸易赤字。	Third, contributing factors included low interest rates, compressed risk spreads, and global imbalances that accommodated low savings in the US, consumption in excess of output, and a mounting trade deficit.
借钱给它们的银行用新债代替旧债，新债的面值平均只有旧债的50 % ， 而美国政府也替银行分担了一些损失。	The banks that had loaned them the money replaced the old debt with new bonds at par value, which averaged 50% of the old bonds, and the US government provided some sweeteners.
尽管SDG主要是为了改善贫穷人口的日常生活，但冷静的经济分析表明，生物多样性方面也不乏明智的目标应该予以考虑。	Though the SDGs will aim largely to improve daily life for the very poor, a cool-headed economic assessment suggests that there are also smart biodiversity targets that should be considered.
不过英国政界大部分人都已经坦然接受了脱欧公投的结果，当务之急就是以最能维护英国国家利益的方式来实现选民这这一意愿。	But most British politicians have come to accept the outcome of the “Brexit” referendum, and that the will of the voters must now be carried out in a manner that best upholds Britain’s national interests.
尽管哈萨克斯坦、乌兹别克斯坦和其他中亚国家经济增长迅速，但最近取得的进步无非是借了国际石油和天然气价格飙升的东风。	Although Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other Central Asian countries have resumed rapid economic growth, much of their recent progress simply correlates with surging world oil and gas prices.
对卡马拉、实际也是对多数非洲统治者的考验在于保护普通民众及其财产，在不借助压迫性措施的前提下建立法律和秩序框架，以及消除腐败现象。	Camara’s test – indeed, the test for most African rulers – consists in protecting civilians and their property, in establishing law and order without oppressive measures, and in fighting corruption.
而中国国内目前正建设一条连接西藏和中尼（泊尔）边境口岸Khasa（中文名为樟木镇）的铁路，并计划延伸到尼泊尔首都加德满都。	Closer to home, a Himalayan railway project to link Tibet to Khasa, at the border with Nepal, is currently under construction, with plans to extend the line all the way to Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital.
"自从2000年在大部分国家发生资产价格的毁灭性跌落之后，金融资产不再给人从前的安全感，这样就刺激了""追求质量""的房地产业。"	"The crash in equity prices since 2000 in most countries has made financial assets look less secure, spurring a ""flight to quality"" - in this case, housing."
幸运的是，无动于衷的成本对任何企业 — — 以及作为整体的经济 — — 都是不可承受之重，因此，我们对消除职场性别偏见的可能性十分乐观。	Fortunately, the cost of doing nothing is too high for any business—and economies as a whole—to bear, which is why we are optimistic that eliminating gender bias at work is possible.
但是美国对于其计划部署一套旨在摧毁由某个流氓国家发射的导弹的系统，却未能向公众给出一个连贯的合理解释。	But America failed to develop a coherent public rationale for its planned deployment of a system designed to destroy a missile fired by a rogue regime.
巴基斯坦的社会和军队精英集团必须达成广泛共识 — — 或许还要借助国外援助，但绝不需要外国干预 — — 确定总理、总统和军队各自的合宪角色。	Pakistan’s civil and military elite must create a broad consensus – perhaps with foreign assistance, but never with foreign meddling – on the constitutional roles of the prime minister, president, and the military.
· 阻止埃塞俄比亚部长们参加国际事务的权利，例如阻止泽纳维作为非洲发展新伙伴关系（New Partnership for Africa's Development）的首脑参加20国峰会的权利。 这也是他一直想谋求参加的会议；	· Donors should deny Ethiopian ministers a seat at diplomatic tables, such as the coveted spot Zenawi got at the G-20 summit in London as head of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development;
欧盟即将展开的2014－2020年欧洲预算谈判是转变方向的绝好机会，应该削减像法国南部国际热核试验反应堆（ITER）这样没有前途的大型项目的资金投入。	The forthcoming negotiations on the EU’s 2014-2020 European budget are an opportunity to change direction and cut the funding for unpromising mega-projectslike the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) effort in southern France.
类似地，在贸易政策方面，一些保护主义措施能给某个行业甚至某个国家带来速效收益，并且 ， （ 比如）如果实施巧妙的出口补贴，这些收益可以维持相当长时间。	Similarly, on trade policy, some protectionist measures can deliver quick benefits to a sector or even a country, and in the case of well-crafted export subsidies, those benefits may last a long time.
但是，尽管美国政府一直对无人机袭击保持沉默在国内或许有帮助，但在也门和其他地区，这释放了一个危险信号。	In every incident recorded in this report, the families of Yemeni civilians killed in US strikes want to know why they were targeted.
此项进程使得西欧的公司和银行能够在高增长的新市场里扩展疆域，从而满足被压抑的需求并开发尚未受到注意的市场潜力。	This process enabled western European companies and banks to expand into new markets with higher growth rates and, thereby satisfying pent-up demand and tapping unrealized potential.
贫困的原因不论是干旱、土壤贫瘠、蝗虫灾害、还是缺乏高产作物的种子，结果都是一样的：绝望、疾病和死亡。	Whether caused by drought, exhausted soils, locusts, lack of high-yield seeds, the results were the same: desperation, disease, and death.
日本政府决定扩大朝鲜官员的再入境禁令，并扩大了针对与朝鲜核开发和导弹开发有关的实体和个人的资产冻结。	Japan’s government has decided to expand a re-entry ban for North Korean officials, and widen the scope of its asset-freeze program for entities and individuals connected to the country’s nuclear and missile development.
尽管基本模型与此不同，但凯恩斯主义者也强调，如果巨富阶层大量储蓄，那么可以预期，不断增加的收入集中度将导致计划储蓄长期超过投资。	While the underlying models differ, the Keynesian versions emphasize that if the super-rich save a lot, ever-increasing income concentration can be expected to lead to a chronic excess of planned savings over investment.
在了解市政资产的市场价值后，健全资产管理的下一步就是要了解城市从收入和资产价格上涨中获得的收益是什么量级的。	After accounting for the market value of municipal assets, the next step toward sound asset management is to understand the yield that a city earns from the revenue and rising market values of its assets.
例如，政治学家格雷厄姆·艾利森认为从1500年后现有大国面对崛起大国共有十六个案例，其中十二个案例均以爆发大规模战争收场。	For example, the political scientist Graham Allison has argued that in 12 of 16 cases since 1500 when an established power has confronted a rising power, the result has been a major war.
但是几十亿美元的税收补贴几乎可以在任何一个部门创造大量的新岗位，关键在于同样是用纳税人的钱进行的投资，许多资本密集程度较低的部门能够创造更多的就业岗位。	But billions of dollars in tax subsidies would create plenty of new jobs in almost any sector: the point is that many less capital-intensive sectors would create many more jobs for a given investment of taxpayers’ money.
中东国家应当详细制定战略去提升教育的质量和年限，投资于职业培训，建立私人部门实习制度并发展中小型企业。	Middle Eastern countries should elaborate strategies to improve the quality and increase the length of schooling, invest in job training, establish private-sector apprenticeships, and develop small and medium-sized businesses.
由于每桶石油大约会产生0.3吨的二氧化碳，因此要让二氧化碳成本达到（比如）40美元/吨，只需要课以每桶12美元的石油税。	Because each barrel of oil emits roughly 0.3 tons of CO2, a carbon tax of, say, $40 per ton of CO2 implies an oil tax of just $12 per barrel.
实际上，巴拉克·奥巴马总统和辛格总理对伊斯兰世界的开放态度，为印巴两国问题的永久政治性解决提供了一个最有利的机会。	Indeed, the open spirit of both President Barack Obama and Singh toward the Islamic world has probably provided the best political opportunity to find a lasting political solution for the India-Pakistan problem.
他的年龄（68岁）可能成为他在2017年大选中的一大障碍，但也有可能成为优势：他是四人中唯一一位让人放心的政治家式的人物。 其他三人中一个是令人失望的现任，另两人急不可耐并且眼里只有全力。	His age (he is 68) might prove to be a handicap in 2017, but it could also be an advantage: he is the only reassuring statesman-like figure in a quartet whose other members are an uninspiring incumbent and two power-obsessed men in a hurry.
例如，美国内外的许多人都开始对美国式的政治制度颇有微词。 他们认为这是种被金钱左右并对局外人关闭大门的制度。	For example, many people both inside and outside the United States had become cynical about the American political system, arguing that it was dominated by money and closed to outsiders.
共和党人拥抱了一个野蛮、奉行种族迫害的真人秀电视明星，而民主党人则由衷喜爱一名几乎没有任何立法成就的自封的社会党参议员。	While Republicans embraced a brutish, race-baiting reality-TV star, many Democrats swooned for a self-declared socialist senator with scarcely any legislative achievements to his name.
关键在于服务业最终得和高速生产率增长的金融业、制造业和信息技术行业在同一个国家的劳动力市场里争夺劳动力。	The problem is that service industries ultimately have to compete for workers in the same national labor pool as sectors with fast productivity growth, such as finance, manufacturing, and information technology.
根据这一轻重缓急的顺序，主要政策响应手段便自动浮出了水面：以“马歇尔计划的规模”大量投资于教育和劳动力训练，以确保人们获得关键技能的培训，从而能够应对这一转型。	Given this priority, the main policy response follows automatically: massive investment, on a “Marshall Plan scale,” in education and workforce training to ensure that humans are taught the critical skills to enable them to cope with the transition.
冷战的两极主宰结构及其后的美国单极时代（即没有结盟国家试图制衡美国）已经让位给了更加复杂、更加相互依赖的多极世界。	The Cold War’s bipolar governance structures and a subsequent period of American unilateralism – to which the non-aligned states attempted to act as a counterbalance – have given way to a much more complex and interdependent multi-polar world.
这不仅加大了预防危机的难度 — — 尤其因为它为参与者提供了钻空子和逃避责任的机会 — — 还使得人们越来越难以采取措施来应对危机。	This makes it harder not only to prevent crises – not least because it creates opportunities for actors to game the system and shirk responsibility – but also to respond to them.
因此能否达成让伊朗可以承受、同时也不超过美、以和其他国家忍受限度的谈判结果很可能会成为今年的首要问题。	The main question this year is thus likely to be whether an outcome can be negotiated that is enough for Iran but not too much for the United States, Israel, and others.
被病毒感染的南非民众数量（相当于丹麦��国人口）超过了相邻莫桑比克、莱索托、博茨瓦纳、纳米比亚、斯威士兰和津巴布韦的总和。	The number of infected South Africans (equivalent to the population of Denmark) outstrips that of neighboring Mozambique, Lesotho, Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe combined.
配额分配应当受成员国的经济地位以及融入全球经济的程度指导，进行配额调整应当以对所有成员国一视同仁的方式进行。	The quota distribution should be guided by members’ economic weight and degree of integration into the global economy, and any quota adjustments must be undertaken in a coherent manner that applies the same standard for all countries.
尽管据称巴基斯坦政府在某些部族地区对巴基斯坦塔利班发动了攻势，但不久前的一部纪录片报道后者正忙于招募实施自杀性袭击的儿童。	Despite a supposed offensive by Pakistan’s government against the TTP in some of the tribal regions, a recent documentary reported that the group is now recruiting young children to carry out suicide attacks.
世界对一个全球霸权架构的顺从 — — 也就是由全球势力维护一个世界秩序的状况 — — 在冷战后幸存了下来。	The world’s acclimation to a global hegemonic structure – in which world powers guarantee an international order – survived the Cold War.
谢菲尔德大学和伦敦卫生和热带医学学院（LSHTM）的研究者估算，2014年约有17亿人处于结核病潜伏状态 — — 略低于全球人口的四分之一。	Researchers from the University of Sheffield and London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) estimate that in 2014, approximately 1.7 billion individuals were latently infected with TB – just under one-quarter of the global population.
尽管其内容与已有的乌俄自由贸易协定完全不冲突，但与欧盟签订契约的计划显然与普京的欧亚联盟工程格格不入。	Though entirely compatible with the existing free-trade agreement between Ukraine and Russia, the proposed pact with the EU certainly was not compatible with Putin’s Eurasia project.
此外，伊斯兰正义和发展党在土耳其选民中拥有广泛的支持，并且在经济发展、人权立法和改善土耳其库尔德少数民族的待遇等问题上都表现得非常出色。	Moreover, the AKP has broad support among Turkish voters and an admirable record of economic growth, human rights legislation, and improvement in the treatment of Turkey’s Kurdish minority.
这就是欧盟只能无助地看到俄罗斯在乌克兰的结盟协定（Association Agreement）谈判中横刀夺爱的原因。	That is why the EU was hopelessly outmaneuvered by Russia in the negotiations with Ukraine over an Association Agreement.
贝尔斯登的股东损失惨重，其管理层大多也就地免职，但债权人获得了完全的保护（事实上，确保保护债权人正是美联储干预的核心动机 ） 。	Bear Stearns’ shareholders did not do well and much of its management immediately left the scene, but creditors were fully protected (in fact, ensuring this protection was a central motivation for the Fed’s intervention).
而这个理由是我在高盛公司任职期间耳熟能详的：开明自利（enlightened self-interest）	And that reason is one that I became familiar with during my years at Goldman Sachs: enlightened self-interest.
结果，耗费大量能源以及低效率的污染企业，例如煤炭和矿物开采、纺织厂、造纸厂、钢铁企业、化工厂以及建材企业统治了中国的经济。	As a result, China’s economy is dominated by resource-hungry and inefficient polluters, such as coal and mineral mines, textile and paper mills, iron and steel makers, petrochemical factories, and building material producers.
最近，在希腊政府准备重返货币市场的过程中 — — 它自2010年以来便被事实上排斥在货币市场之外 — — 希腊公共债务当局一直在试水发行长期债券。	Recently, in preparation for the government’s return to the money markets – from which it has been effectively excluded since 2010 – Greece’s public-debt authority has been testing the waters with a long-term bond issue.
随之而来的是，衰退风险将继续阴魂不散，失业危机将继续深化，而不平等性将随着已然千疮百孔的社会安全网的进一步损坏而继续提高。	In the process, the risk of recession remains uncomfortably high, the unemployment crisis deepens, and inequities rise as already-stretched social safety nets prove even more porous.
2012年第三季度美国家庭负债相当于收入的112 % — —虽然较2006年的创纪录高位有所回落，但仍比20世纪最后30年75%的标准高了几乎40个百分点。	Household debt stood at 112% of income in the third quarter of 2012 – down from record highs in 2006, but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75% norm of the last three decades of the twentieth century.
华盛顿 — — 当英国成为19世纪和20世纪初世界上第一个经历大规模城市化的国家，城市化进程彻底改变了它的经济和社会。	WASHINGTON, DC – When the United Kingdom became the first country in the world to undergo large-scale urbanization in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the process transformed its economy and society.
减缓长期气候变化趋势的最佳方法是减少碳化物的排放。 这至少有三个办法： 改用非碳能源，诸如太阳能和核能。	The best way to reduce long-term climate change is to reduce carbon emissions.
21世纪初，中国对美国国债的无穷无尽的胃口帮助美国利率保持低位，维持了资产市场泡沫，也让终极消费者能够过上收入远远不足以支撑的生活水平 — — 直到2008年音乐戛然而止。	And China’s voracious appetite for Treasuries in the early 2000s helped keep US interest rates low, sustaining the froth in asset markets that allowed the Ultimate Consumer to live well beyond its means – until the music stopped in 2008.
比如，所有其他的发达国家都承认其公民有获得价格合理医疗服务的权力，而奥巴马的可承担医疗法案（Affordable Care Act）则代表了朝该目标迈进的重要一步。	For example, every other advanced country recognizes the right to accessible health care, and Obama’s Affordable Care Act represents a significant step toward that goal.
小额信贷发轫于20世纪80年代的孟加拉国，由非盈利的格莱珉银行（Grameen Bank）和BRAC银行发起。	The microfinance industry began in the 1980’s in Bangladesh with the non-profit Grameen Bank and BRAC Bank.
收入不平等的恶化也将削弱抵抗危机的能力：随着能在坏年景时动用储蓄的人越来越少，对增长的冲击也就越来越大。	Rising inequality may also have increased vulnerability to crisis: with fewer people able to dip into savings during bad times, the impact on growth is even larger.
移民比较难以有效地谈判工资 — — （比如）因为语言障碍或学历不受承认 — — 因此国家最终会出现一个双轨就业市场。	With immigrants less able to negotiate wages effectively – owing to, say, language barriers or unrecognized credentials – countries end up with a two-track job market.
针对孟加拉国每年在公共采购上花费超过90亿美元的一项案例研究显示，仅在一个政府部门试行电子采购就降低了12%的价格，从而可以将节省下来的更多资源用于其他重要的预算事项。	A case study in Bangladesh, which spends more than $9 billion on public procurement annually, found that piloting e-procurement in just one government department lowered prices by 12%, leaving more resources for other important budget priorities.
每当全球和地区强国与这些价值背道而驰，或与这样的国家建立紧密盟友关系时，本应带来安全和日益繁荣（从某种程度上说也的确如此）的国际秩序就会遭到破坏。	Whenever a global or regional power acts in a way that contradicts these values, or allies itself closely with those who do, it undermines the international order, which should deliver security and increasing prosperity (and to some degree has).
摩洛哥拥有可靠的基础设施条件、鲁棒的银行系统、坚挺的公共财政状况，通货膨胀率低，失业也处于可控水平。	Morocco boasts solid infrastructure, a robust banking system, sound public finances, low inflation, and manageable unemployment.
事实上，法国、意大利、比荷卢经济联盟（包括比利时、荷兰和卢森堡）以及德国早在1952年就已经同意在欧洲防务共同体框架下组建欧洲军队。	Indeed, France, Italy, the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), and Germany had agreed to form a European army as early as 1952 under the Framework of the European Defense Community.
叙利亚和伊朗的结盟让沙特深感不安。 它担心如果叙利亚在黎巴嫩重新掌控以及伊朗和什叶派实力随之得到加强将会威胁到王国本身。	The Saudis, deeply disturbed by the Syrian-Iranian alliance, worry that re-imposition of Syrian supremacy in Lebanon, and with it the strengthening of Iranian and Shiite power there, would threaten the Kingdom itself.
正式的国际联盟授权及其他霸权工具确保石油、港口、货运线路和区域领导人的外交政策完全控制在英法列强的手中。	Formal League of Nations mandates and other instruments of hegemony were exercised to ensure British and French power over oil, ports, shipping lanes, and local leaders’ foreign policies.
这封信将阐述美国有责任帮助巴勒斯坦在以色列提供的补偿下，根据1967年停火线，建立一个可行的、与以色列相邻的、主权独立的国家，无论双方是否能达成领土调整协议。	Such a letter could spell out the US commitment to a viable, contiguous, sovereign, and independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines, with compensation provided by Israel wherever territorial adjustments are agreed.
来自美国煤炭业中心西弗吉尼亚州共和党议员大卫·麦金利（David McKinley）说我的证词“让他打了一个寒颤 ” ， 接着把话题引向了我担任市长的西雅图市的犯罪率。	David McKinley, a Republican congressman from West Virginia, in the heart of America’s coal country, replied that my words “sent a shiver up [his] spine,” then changed the subject to the crime rate in Seattle, where I was Mayor.
现在，冷漠的资本已经对虚假的市场信号无动于衷了，而随着恒定的时间偏好被重新认识，越来越多的不当投资的清盘正通过系统渗透出来。	Impassive capital now ignores deceptive market signals, and the liquidation of untenable mal-investment percolates through the system as immutable time preferences prevail.
对于欧洲人来说，当自己在安全事务方面的可靠性在许多方面都未能得到满足的时候，自然很难去设定未来的安全议程。	It is not that easy for Europeans to set the future security agenda when their credibility on defense matters leaves so much to be desired.
两年前的1976年，毛泽东去世，恢复名誉的邓小平成为他的继任者，并在1978年的中共十一届三中全会上确定了他的经济发展和现代化计划。	Mao Zedong had died two years earlier, in 1976, and the newly rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping succeeded in stamping his vision of economic development and modernization on the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee held in December 1978.
美国国防部为微电子合同出资数百亿美元，不仅补偿了创新企业蒙受的风险，而且建成了能支持初创企业成长的基础设施。	The US Department of Defense put up tens of billions of dollars in contracts for microelectronics, a commitment that both paid down innovators’ risk and created an infrastructure that would support the growth of start-ups.
这一新型尼古丁提供系统除了可以作为戒烟者的临时辅助手段，也可以成为烟草的长期替代品 — — 让几乎完全消灭烟草消费成为可能。	Beyond serving as a temporary aid for people attempting to quit smoking cigarettes, such new nicotine-delivery systems could act as long-term alternatives to tobacco – making it possible to eliminate tobacco consumption almost entirely.
更重要的是，他似乎陶醉于与美国总统唐纳德·特朗普政府之间一场不断的仇恨升级，原因是土耳其监禁一名美国牧师并购买俄罗斯S-400型导弹防御系统。	And to top it off, he seems to be reveling in an escalating feud with US President Donald Trump’s administration over Turkey’s imprisonment of an American pastor and purchase of a Russian S-400 missile-defense system.
对资本更高回报的渴求驱使投资者和投机者转向发展中国家，这类流入增加了杠杆，撑起了股价，并在某些情况下支撑了商品价格上涨。	The search for higher yields drove investors and speculators to developing countries, where the inflows increased leverage, propped up equity prices, and in some cases supported a commodity price boom.
这种适应能力提高了瘟疫的生物适应性，而这对啮齿动物 — — 以及生活在啮齿动物周围的人来说 — — 已经被证明是一场噩梦。	This adaptation improved the plague’s biological fitness, which, for rodents – and the humans who live near them – has proven to be a nightmare.
正如我们少数人在2003—2006年期间发出的危机迫在眉睫的警告，一些人 — — 包括国际清算银行和IMF — — 今天也在大声疾呼，但没有人听他们的。	Just as a few of us warned of impending crisis in the 2003-2006 period, some – including the Bank of International Settlements and the IMF– are sounding the alarm today, but to no avail.
其次，发���人可以增加“总数条款 ” ， 规定有足够多数的某国债券持有人（比如三分之二）支持，就可以形成可约束所有债券持有人的协议。	Second, issuers could add “aggregation clauses” specifying that an agreement supported by a qualified majority of a country’s bondholders, say, two-thirds, would bind one and all.
事实上，尽管人们在ECT是治疗严重的抑郁障碍最有效的方法上有共识，但是，在治疗情绪障碍的大部分方法中，它是最后选择的方法。	In fact, despite a consensus that ECT is the most effective treatment for severe depressive disorder, it comes at the bottom of the list in most treatment regimens for mood disorders.
这只是可以舍弃的一种便利 — — 而正统犹太教徒很难相信他们所恪守的法律目的是要最大限度地方便生活。	It’s just a convenience that one can do without – and orthodox Jews can hardly believe that the laws to which they adhere were intended to make life maximally convenient.
贸易壁垒面向地区协定所包括的少数贸易伙伴降低，这些国家的生产者往往会将注意力转移到这些贸易伙伴身上，导致来自其他国家的进口下降。	When trade barriers are lowered for the few trading partners included in the regional agreement, producers in those countries tend to shift their attention to those partners, causing imports from other countries to decline.
美国的衰退从2007年12月开始，而且最起码要持续到2009年12月—这是 美国自二战以来持续时间 最长，最严重的 一场危机 ，GDP（国内生产总值）大约将累计下滑超过5 % 。	In the US, recession started in December 2007, and will last at least until December 2009 – the longest and deepest US recession since World War II, with the cumulative fall in GDP possibly exceeding 5%.
如此全面的量化评估不但能给政客更大的激励做出明智的选择而不仅仅是政治上的权宜之计，也有助于选民做出关于应该由谁来代表他们的更加知情的选择。	Such comprehensive quantitative assessments would not only give politicians greater incentive to make smart – not just politically expedient – choices, but also help voters make more informed decisions about who should represent them.
最终新一代动物保护分子成功联合起来，才使英国防止虐待动物协会走出这种自以为是的状态，投入到反对密集笼箱养鸡以及其他集中饲喂动物的运动当中。	It took a concerted effort by the new animal radicals of the 1970’s to stir the RSPCA from its complacency towards the battery cage and other forms of intensive animal rearing.
政府规范和执法的力度不够，林业管理的不负责任，加之对非法采伐的巨大市场引诱，正在共同把世界上最珍贵和濒危消亡的森林都夷为平地。	Irresponsible forest management, enhanced by poor governmental regulation and enforcement, and markets that reward illegal logging, are conspiring to denude the world’s most valuable and threatened forests.
毕竟，当今全球化金融和经济系统的一大特征乃是连通性，如果没有几乎遍地开花的广泛复苏，任何一地都不可能获得充分复苏。	After all, given the connectedness that characterizes today’s globalized financial and economic systems, a full recovery anywhere is virtually impossible without a broad-based recovery nearly everywhere.
相反，在“有管理的民主”的教条下，普京建立了他的软独裁，法律被赤裸裸地用于政治目的；而当法律还不足以得到目的的话，国家就会祭出暗杀的招数。	Instead, under the credo of “managed democracy,” Putin has established a soft dictatorship, in which the law is flagrantly used for political ends; and, when the law is insufficient, the state resorts to assassination.
但是，正如卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和肯·罗格夫（Ken Rogoff）很早前便指出的，后危机时期的复苏通常是缓慢而痛苦的。	But, as Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff have long documented, post-crisis healing is typically slow and painful.
如今只有极少数韩国人还记得那段艰难的时光，但对朝鲜人来说，农村地区在这一时节的饥饿感却是实实在在的。	Few South Koreans remember those straitened months anymore, but for North Koreans, hunger in the countryside during this time of year is very real.
让很多人 — — 或至少许多专家 — — 出乎意料的是，公投后的早期证据显示，他们是错的，戈夫才是对的。	The early post-referendum evidence suggested, to the surprise of many – or at least to many of the experts – that Gove was right and they were wrong.
随着20世纪80年代出现了艾滋病毒（它会削弱免疫系统 ） ， 肺结核也重回人间，并成为艾滋病毒携带者第一大致命病因。	With the emergence in the 1980’s of HIV, which compromises the immune system, TB reemerged, and is the number-one killer of HIV-infected individuals.
他也一直在削弱默克尔的外交政策，支持奥地利总理库尔茨和匈牙利总理欧尔班甚至俄罗斯总统普京等其他民粹主义和民族主义领导人。	He has also been undercutting Merkel’s foreign policy, by throwing his support behind other populist and nationalist leaders such as Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and even Russian President Vladimir Putin.
我与开放社会基金会共同编辑的一份 2014年未来数字新闻报告认为，政府利用财政压力来操纵审查对象国超过半数的新闻媒体。	According to a 2014 report on the future of digital journalism, which I co-edited for the Open Society Foundations, governments used financial pressure to manipulate news organizations in more than half of the markets we examined.
更糟的是，2016年11月，长期以来一直对俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京表达敬意的唐纳德·特朗普当选美国总统。	Making matters worse, in November of 2016, Donald Trump, who has long expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, was elected president of the United States.
重叠且冲突的土地管理制度随处可见，土地记录难以查阅，或早已过时，或记录不全，或不够准确，甚至根本不存在。	Overlapping and conflicting land-management systems are the norm, as are inaccessible, out-of-date, incomplete, inaccurate, or nonexistent land records.
在欧洲这块长期以中左及中右翼党派竞争为特色的大陆，即使不考虑党派利益，左派崩溃所产生的影响可能也是非常深远的。	On a continent long defined by democratic competition between center-right and center-left parties, the collapse of the left could have far-reaching consequences, beyond particular party interests.
除此之外，官僚体系越来越不愿采取主动大胆的行动 — — 这是习近平主席发起大规模反腐运动后的一个意料之外的结果 — — 中国所面临的任务之艰巨可见一斑。	Add to that the bureaucracy’s increasing reluctance to take bold action – an unintended consequence of President Xi Jinping’s aggressive anti-corruption campaign – and the scale of the task China is facing becomes clear.
例如，2013年上半年，马来西亚政府的广告开支比排名第二到第五位的四家广告企业的总和还多美元1.18亿。	During the first half of 2013, for example, Malaysia’s government spent $118.5 million more on ads than the next four advertisers combined.
美国的知识产权制度 — — 也是美国借助TRIPS协议强加到世界其它地方的制度 — — 是不平衡的。	America’s intellectual-property regime – and the regime that the US has helped to foist upon the rest of the world through the TRIPS agreement – is unbalanced.
其次，大量回购协议融资通过货币市场基金（此类基金必须进行极短期投资，因为其储户要求即刻的流动性）流入了曼氏金融、雷曼和贝尔斯登等大型风险承担金融公司。	Second, much repo financing flows into large risk-taking financial firms like MF Global, Lehman, and Bear Stearns through money-market funds, which must invest very short-term, because their depositors want immediate liquidity.
但有一条历史规律确实在起作用：在大规模经济危机期间，选民们继续追随经济管理能力一直为他们所信任的政党，而正是这些人把他们引向了毁灭。	Yet one historical law does seem to apply: in an immense economic crisis, the voters stick with the people whose economic competence they have traditionally trusted – that is, the very people who led them to ruin.
2009—2010年，欧洲银行合作计划（European Bank Coordination Initiative ） ， 即俗称的“维也纳计划 ” （ Vienna Initiative）通过阻止国有母银行的恐慌性争相退出，避免了一场系统性危机。	In 2009-2010, the European Bank Coordination Initiative – known informally as the “Vienna Initiative” – helped to avert a systemic crisis in developing Europe by stopping foreign-owned parent banks from staging a catastrophic stampede to the exits.
但鉴于特朗普对边缘政治和对抗的热爱，合理的预期是贸易战将进一步升级，就像中国对美国大豆、猪肉和葡萄酒征收关税一样。	But, given Trump’s love of brinkmanship and confrontation, it is reasonable to expect further escalation, as with China’s tariffs on US soy beans, pork, and wine.
但共和党 — — 或者说所有人 — — 应该明白激励很重要：为那些投资于美国并创造就业的公司减税，同时为不那么做的公司加税，效果会好得多。	But Republicans, of all people, should understand that incentives matter: it would be far better to reduce taxes for those companies that invest in America and create jobs, and increase taxes for those that don’t.
这项难民教育实验始于2005年，那时我和其他孩子住在乌干达霍伊马（Hoima）地区的康瓦里（Kyangwali）难民定居点。	This experiment in refugee education began in 2005, when I and other children were living in the Kyangwali refugee settlement in Uganda’s Hoima district.
现在欧洲的武器可能落在中国人手里，并瞄准着保卫一个2300万人口的民主国家（换句话说，这相当于北欧国家的人口之和）的美国军队。	Now it may be European arms in the hands of the Chinese that will be aimed at American troops protecting a democracy with 23 million inhabitants (in other words, as many people as in all the Nordic countries combined).
到2030年，全世界超过80%的穷人将生活在可定义为“脆弱”的地区 — — 脆弱是一种可能因为政治、社会、安全、经济、环境等原因所造成的状态。	By 2030, more than 80% of the world’s poor will live in an area defined as “fragile” – a status that may reflect any number of political, social, security, economic, or environmental causes.
此外，在八日冲突（eight-day clash）中，哈马斯长期流亡的领导人马沙尔（Khaled Meshal）从埃及进入加沙，此前他从来不敢公开在以色列面前露面。	Moreover, in the wake of the eight-day clash, Hamas’s long-exiled leader, Khaled Meshal, who had never before dared to show himself openly to Israel, entered Gaza from Egypt.
死刑现在可能被大多数美国人所接受，但在欧洲，事实上是在世界的大部分地区，死刑却被看作严重违背了人权。	Capital punishment may now be supported by a majority of Americans, but the death penalty is regarded as an egregious violation of human rights across Europe - indeed, across much of the world.
目前，穿越土耳其进入叙利亚加入伊斯兰国的外国潜在圣战分子数量暴跌，从每月2,000人减少到50人左右。	Already, the flow of foreign would-be jihadists crossing from Turkey into Syria to join ISIS has plunged, from 2,000 per month to about 50.
他们或多或少会问，这场混乱是该地区众多社会和政治制度共有的深刻缺陷的必然结果吗？ 它在多大程度上是拜外部国家的选择（或没有选择）的政策所赐？	To what extent, they will ask, was it the inevitable result of deep flaws common to many of the region's societies and political systems, and to what extent did it stem from what outside countries chose to do (or not to do)?
即使在低正利率情况下，如果维持很长一段时间，也可能适得其反，助长资产泡沫，导致家庭和公司债务增至不可持续水平。	Even low positive interest rates, if maintained for a prolonged period, could backfire, fueling asset bubbles and enabling household and corporate debt to grow to unsustainable levels.
在三月份，英国的主要黄色报刊《世界新闻》以“F1老板和5个妓女进行恶心的纳粹狂欢”为标题，发表了一个“独家”头版报道。	In March, Britain’s leading scandal sheet, The News of the World published an “exclusive” front page story, under the headline “F1 BOSS HAS SICK NAZI ORGY WITH 5 HOOKERS.”
如果布什总统的部队“急流”不能交出一份可以称作“胜利”的答卷，那么美国可以从中为其未来的对外政策吸取什么样的教训呢？	If President George W. Bush’s current troop “surge” fails to produce an outcome that can be called “victory,” what lessons will the United States draw for its future foreign policy?
意大利当前的实际（排除通胀因素后的）人均GDP依然低于1998年启动欧元实验时的水平，而即便是遭遇了2009年以来萧条的希腊也已经成功地实现了增长。	Italy’s real (inflation-adjusted) per capita GDP is currently lower than it was when the euro experiment began in 1998, whereas even Greece has managed to register growth, despite its depression from 2009 onward.
我们希望希腊不会被迫离开欧元区，尽管临时性措施 — — 比如采取资本管制 — — 也许最终对于防止金融崩溃必不可少。	Greece, one hopes, will not be forced to leave the eurozone, though temporary options such as imposing capital controls may ultimately prove necessary to prevent a financial meltdown.
与此同时，政策制定者需要采取措施提高最低收入者的工资，这实际上将有助于提高生产率，因为资本相对于劳动力的成本更低。	At the same time, policymakers need to pursue measures to increases wages for the lowest earners, which could actually help boost productivity as capital becomes less expensive relative to labor.
发达国家公民对“建制 ” — —包括经济“专家 ” 、 主流政治领导人、主要跨国公司 — — 感到失望，越来越多的人指责它们是经济艰难的罪魁祸首。	Advanced-country citizens are frustrated with an “establishment” – including economic “experts,” mainstream political leaders, and dominant multinational companies – which they increasingly blame for their economic travails.
比如，在许多亚洲国家 — — 包括印度、中国和巴基斯坦 — — 由于过度开采和能源补贴，地下水水位以值得警惕的速度下降。	For example, in many Asian countries – including India, China, and Pakistan – groundwater levels are declining at an alarming rate, owing to over-extraction and energy subsidies.
在这一领域，欧洲也一马当先，特别是在全球气候变暖问题上，这表明人们可以抛弃渺小的自私来实现共同的福祉。	In this area, too, Europe has taken the lead, especially concerning global warming, showing that petty selfishness can be put aside to achieve a common good.
其中一个原因源自于某些初始条件 — — 这些条件在扩大了对峙和冲突范围的同时限制了可以从贸易增加中取得的直接受益。	One reason is rooted in initial conditions that limit direct gains from increased trade while widening the scope for tension and conflict.
批评者将这一“危机约束综合症 ” （ crisis straitjacket syndrome）视为一根筋通胀目标的主要问题。	Critics identify this “crisis straitjacket syndrome” as the main problem with single-minded inflation targeting.
例如社会变革和发展需要两者与专政统治所需要的政治稳定原则之间的内在紧张关系，使得当前形势在长期上是不可持续的。	For example, the inherent tension between the social change that development demands and the imperative of political stability required by authoritarian rule makes the current situation unsustainable in the long run.
在随后的冲突中，难民穿越边境，涌入邻国印度，在拥挤的难民营中暂住，这形成了非常完美的条件，霍乱不爆发都难。	In the ensuing conflict, refugees poured across the border into neighboring India into crowded camps, creating conditions that inevitably gave rise to cholera outbreaks.
有史以来第一次，发达国家和发展中国家承认有义务控制温室气体排放，并接受了将全球升温控制在两度以内的协议目标。	For the first time ever, developed and developing countries acknowledged their responsibility to curb emissions of greenhouse gasses and agreed on the goal of limiting global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius.
然后正如我们现在所见，未来11国是一个大杂烩：韩国、墨西哥、印尼、土耳其、伊朗、埃及、尼日利亚、菲律宾、巴基斯坦，孟加拉和越南。	Then as now, the N-11 comprised a mixed bag: South Korea, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.
1979年，弗里德曼夫妇自信满满地定论道，没有政府指令的歧视（比如南方种族歧视法案法案Jim Crow法 ） ， 市场经济会形成充分平等的收入分配。	In 1979, the Friedmans could confidently claim that, in the absence of government-mandated discrimination (for example, the South’s segregationist Jim Crow laws), the market economy would produce a sufficiently egalitarian distribution of income.
在其他欧洲国家，英国的情况类似，总公共债务从2012年占GDP的85.3%增加到2015年的89.3 % 。	Elsewhere in Europe, the United Kingdom has followed a similar trajectory, with gross public debt increasing from 85.3% of GDP in 2012 to 89.3% of GDP in 2015.
查韦斯甚至为美国一些低收入家庭提供取暖燃料补助，而该项目也随前美国众议员乔·肯尼迪二世在2006年发布的电视广告而名声大噪。	Chávez even funded heating fuel for some low-income households in the US, a program made famous by former US representative Joe Kennedy II’s 2006 television ads.
只有那些熟悉欧洲历史并积极地与准成员国就欧洲的现实和未来进行探讨的人才能在不同的文化和宗教之间担当桥梁的作用。	Only those who are familiar with European history and who engage in discussion with the candidate countries about what Europe is and should be will be able to bridge the gap between different cultures and religions.
但抛开人道对待动物协会宣传的功过不论，在联合国人权理事会坚持言论自由的人应当认识到这样一个事实，即某种形式的言论造成某些人的反感并不是审查这些言论的充分理由。	Irrespective of the merits of PETA’s campaign, however, those who stood up for free speech at the UN Human Rights Council should be able to see that the fact that some forms of speech cause offense is not sufficient reason to censor them.
但联盟同时也从前任政府手中接手了一个烂摊子，全球经济危机严重冲击了该国经济，但由于不负责任的选举操作，前任政府不但没有尝试去克服困难，还许下众多收买民心的空头支票，巨额的政府预算赤字已经占到GDP的16 % 。	The global economic crisis not only hit the country hard, but, because of irresponsible electioneering, the previous government did not even try to fight it. Reckless populist promises left a gaping 16%-of-GDP budget deficit.
妊娠期是贫穷妇女最为脆弱的时期之一；每年死于与妊娠有关的并发症的529000名妇女中，有99%都在发展中国家。	Pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times for poor women; 99% of the 529,000 women who die annually from pregnancy-related complications live in developing countries.
俄罗斯或许不再是超级大国；但在普京眼中，它是反对美国鲁莽外交政策、恶意经济行为以及堕落道德的崇高道德文明的化身。	Russia might not be a superpower anymore; but, according to Putin, it represents a morally superior civilization battling America’s foreign-policy recklessness, malevolent economic practices, and moral depravity.
伊朗总统内贾德或许由于其对美国的强烈批评而在整个穆斯林世界赢得支持，但是在伊朗国内，他却在丧失实力。	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad may be gaining support across the Muslim world for his fervent criticism of the United States, but inside Iran, he is losing strength.
欧洲量子物理研究所有两个独立的物理学家小组最近宣布，虽然信号仍有两千分之一的可能来自平常的非希格斯进程，但他们的数据显示希格斯粒子已经被发现。	At CERN, two independent teams of physicists recently announced that their data were consistent with detection of a Higgs particle, though there remained a 1-in-2,000 chance that the signal came from mundane, non-Higgs processes.
尽管爱尔兰农民协会有点晚了地敦促其八万五千名成员支持条约，民意调查表明农民们反对里斯本条约的比例达到二比一。	Although the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) has belatedly urged its 85,000 members to support the Treaty, opinion polls show farmers are opposed to Lisbon by a two to one majority.
这一趋势开始于20世纪90年代初的斯堪的纳维亚国家，但决定性变化发生在1997年英国成立金融服务局（Financial Services Authority，我是第一任局长 ） 。	The movement began in Scandinavia in the early 1990’s, but the most dramatic change came in 1997, when the United Kingdom introduced its Financial Services Authority (I was its first chairman).
认识到特朗普的“美国优先”和莫迪的“印度制造”方针之间的综合需要创造力、耐心、灵活性以及，最重要的，战略焦点。	Identifying synergies between Trump’s “America first” and Modi’s “Make in India” approaches will require creativity, patience, flexibility, and most important, a strategic focus.
"比如上文提到的福格尔就属于属于一个名为""打破僵局""的组织，而该组织则由一群致力于推进和平的巴勒斯坦和以色列商界领袖组成。"	Fogel belongs to Breaking the Impasse (BTI), a group of prominent Palestinian and Israeli business leaders committed to advancing peace.
书评家称赞皮凯蒂的引述颇具巴尔扎克和简·奥斯汀的神韵；但实际情况却是除少得可怜的文学比喻外，读者看到最多的还是经济学家干巴巴的论述和统计数据。	Reviewers have made much of Piketty’s references to Honoré de Balzac and Jane Austen; yet the fact is that the reader will encounter mainly an economist’s dry prose and statistics, while the literary allusions are few and far between.
骆家辉旅行时自己背包，自己在星巴克买咖啡 — — 中国高级官员让下级去做的琐事他都事必躬亲 — — 这让许多人在网上称赞他是真正的人民公仆。	Photographs of Locke carrying his own daypack and buying coffee at Starbucks – humble acts that high-ranking Chinese officials would have underlings do – spurred a flurry of online posts celebrating him as a virtuous public servant.
尽管目前外国人持有着大约一半的美国政府债务，但最新报告表明，外国买家在不断减少，国内投资者购买了全部新发政府债务。	Although foreigners now own about 50% of US government debt, recent reports indicate that foreign buyers are remaining on the sidelines and domestic investors are currently buying all of the new government debt.
中国的回答 — — 该银行能够促进“金砖国家间更稳健、更深入的关系的发展 ” — —并没有提供多少实质内容。	And China’s answer – that the bank would foster the “development of more robust and inter-dependent ties between the BRICS” – provides little substance.
牧民、小生产商和独立农民根本无法与低廉的零售价格竞争 — — 这样的价格无法覆盖该行业真正的环境和健康成本。	Pastoralists, small producers, and independent farmers simply cannot compete with low retail prices that fail to account for the industry’s true environmental and health costs.
另一方面，如果伊朗政权继续决意不顾成本地追求其核目标，那么我们就会知道，不存在可以替代前两种选择的方案，即要么袭击伊朗核设施，要么接受有核伊朗。	If, on the other hand, the regime remains determined to pursue its nuclear goals, regardless of cost, then we will know that there is no alternative to the first two options: attacking Iranian facilities or living with a nuclear-armed Iran.
"根据""摩尔定律 "" - 由英特尔的前总裁在1975年阐明，并以其名字命名-计算机芯片上的元件数量每两年就要翻一番。"	"According to ""Moore's Law"" -- named after the president of Intel, who formulated it in 1975 -- the amount of components on a computer chip doubles every two years."
在公开的场合下，所有联络小组的成员都试图让最终地位问题处于未决状态。 但是私下里，美国及其部分盟国告诉另外两方说它们将会在今年提议独立。	In public, all Contact Group members have tried to leave the question of Kosovo’s final status open, but informally the US and some of its allies have told the two parties that they will propose independence this year.
这一反差至少部分可归因于巴西在以商品、服务、金融、人口以及数据和通信流为标准的“连通性 ” （ connectedness）上只名列第43位。	This disparity can be at least partly explained by its 43rd-place ranking for “connectedness” in terms of flows of goods, services, finance, people, and data and communications.
无论如何，必须让中东自主拥有解决其所面临的挑战的办法；毕竟，到目前为止还没有外界施加的解决办法奏效。	In any case, the Middle East must be allowed to take ownership of solutions to the challenges it faces; after all, no externally imposed solution has worked so far.
虽然少数族裔的语言很重要，而且持这些语言者的权利必须得到尊重 — — 就像乌克兰的新教育法做到的那样 — — 真正将一个社会凝聚起来并使公民得以充分参与社会事务还是要靠官方语言。	While minority languages are important and the rights of their speakers must be respected – as Ukraine’s new education law does – it is the official language that unites a society and enables citizens to participate in it fully.
发自哥本哈根 — — 在整个欧洲大陆，新预算紧缩时代的来临使得各国政府都开始削减预算，而国防经费则是他们最容易下手的目标，连戴维·卡梅伦领导下的英国保守党政府都投身到了这股压缩国防支出的热潮之中。	COPENHAGEN – All over Europe, budgets are being pared as a new age of austerity takes hold. Defense expenditures are proving to be the easiest of targets.
上述国家面对危机束手无策的一个重要原因是对民众投资的长期欠缺，因此阻碍普通民众从经济增长中收获好处。	One important reason for these countries’ vulnerability is the consistent lack of investment in their populations, which has prevented ordinary citizens from reaping the benefits of economic growth.
比如，央行可以宣布（比如）今后两年的环境可以保证通胀目标较平常水平 — — 即每年2 % ， 几乎一成不变 — — 提高一倍。	For example, a central bank might announce that circumstances during, say, the next two years warrant a doubling of the inflation target from the usual – that is, almost never varied – annual rate of 2%.
这就是我认为他的新著《地图和领土 》 （ The Map and the Territory）令人大失所望的原因。	That is why I find his new book, The Map and the Territory, so disappointing.
事实上，尽管经历了法雅德主义的崛起，巴勒斯坦民族运动仍然小心翼翼地避免背叛其真正的合法性来源：那就是难民和剥夺。	Indeed, despite of the rise of Fayaadism, the Palestinian national movement will be careful not to betray its real sources of legitimacy: the ethos of dispossession and the refugee.
将高速盈利增长进行外推也不是主要因素，因为标注普尔指数最新真实每股收益只比十年前（2008年金融危机爆发前夕）的峰值高了6 % 。	Nor is extrapolation of rapid earnings growth a significant factor, given that the latest real earnings per share for the S&P index are only 6% above their peak about ten years earlier, before the 2008 financial crisis erupted.
虽然选举的实施相对容易，但自由却更难以建立和维持，因为后者需要相关机制 — — 比如一个拥有中立法庭的司法系统，但这些机制却是埃及目前所不具备，并要花费多年才能建立的。	While elections are relatively easy to stage, liberty is far more difficult to establish and sustain, for it requires institutions – such as a legal system with impartial courts – that Egypt lacks, and that take years to build.
国际足联称，这种额外的关注和投资“可带来显著的中长期社会经济效益 . . . . . . 以及经济增长 。 ”	And that added attention and investment, FIFA claims, “may contribute to significant mid- and long-term socioeconomic benefits … as well as economic growth.”
这使得建立在狭小领域推理的“专家系统”或是设计寻找离散事实的搜索引擎成为可能，但我们距离能够以我们的方式 — — 在包括时间的众多环境中穿梭自如 — — 进行推理的AI还有很长的路要走。	While this makes it possible to build “expert systems” that reason in narrow domains, or to design search engines that can find discrete facts, we are no closer to AI that reasons the way that we do – in and across multiple contexts, including time.
无论如何，GDP增长都会随商业信心、消费和房价的不振 — — 或者因为工党的新税收政策，或者因为保守党带来的欧盟成员资格不确定性 — — 而减速。	In either case, GDP growth is likely to slow as business confidence, consumption, and house prices suffer – either from new taxes under Labour or from uncertainties about EU membership under the Conservatives.
如果有国家在已经按照委员会建议缩紧预算、并获得欧元区财长会议批准的情况下还是打破了赤字限制，那么它就有可能受到区别对待。	Yet an exception might be warranted where a violation of the deficit ceiling has led to fiscal tightening in line with advice from the Commission and endorsed by Ecofin.
事实上，特朗普在选战期间向其支持者所许下的许多承诺具有高度的分裂性，甚至可以说非常危险，而兑现这些承诺有可能给普通美国人的生活带来严重负面影响，引发社会动荡。	In fact, many of the promises Trump made to his supporters during the campaign are highly divisive and even dangerous, and their implementation could have serious adverse effects on the lives of ordinary Americans, triggering civil unrest.
中国所谓的“九段线”基本上将整个南中国海变成了南中国的内湖，但这实际上这是民国时期遗留下来的说法。 那蒋介石委员长是在哪儿找到这套说辞的？	China’s so-called “nine dashes” claim, which essentially seeks to turn the entire South China Sea into a southern Chinese lake, represents a legacy of Chiang Kai-Shek’s Republic of China.
这一系列被推翻和放逐的政府，使另一位杰出的泰国学者帕文·差瓦彭分（Pavin Chchavalpongpun）将自己的国家称为“失败的国家 ” 。	This parade of toppled and ousted governments has led Pavin Chchavalpongpun, another eminent Thai scholar, to call his country a “failed state.”
但特朗普向一个叙利亚空军基地发射59枚战斧式导弹以反击巴沙尔·阿萨德总统部队最新化武袭击事件的决策很有可能从另一个角度 — — 或许更清楚地表明 — — 各方的立场。	But Trump’s decision to fire 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian airbase, in response to the latest chemical weapons attack by President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, is likely to provide another – perhaps more revealing – indication of who stands where.
到那时，现在持有央行资金的德国和荷兰的资产卖家将注意到，他们手里拿着的是对不再安全的本国央行的债权。	At that time, German and Dutch asset sellers who now hold central bank money will notice that their stocks are claims against their central banks that are no longer covered.
而且不是所有人都那么幸运，因为现有的中心每天只能为500名儿童提供教育 — — 还不到营内学龄人口的一半。	Yet not even this option is available to all, as the existing centers can provide education to only 500 children per day – less than half the school-age population.
但是最能改变现状的就是强大的伊斯兰抵抗运动。 他们无法解决这些弊病，只是在寻找另外一种强加于社会的专政独裁。	But the most powerful alternative to the status quo are powerful Islamist opposition movements that have no real answers for these ailments and merely seek to impose another flavor of dictatorship.
英国新任的保守党多数政府承诺到2017年底、甚至就在明年就欧盟成员国资格举行公投其实并不像外界所描绘的那样孤立。	The United Kingdom, whose new majority Conservative government has pledged to hold a referendum on European Union membership by the end of 2017, perhaps even next year, is not the outlier that it is often portrayed as being.
对此文化和伊斯兰指导部前部长侯赛因·萨法尔·哈兰迪则表达了这种恐惧，他说 ： “ 这是一场针对伊斯兰共和国的‘软战争 ’ ， 而那些希望拥有一个负责任政府的公民们就是战争的一部分 。 ”	Hossein Saffar Harandi, a former minister of culture and Islamic guidance, expressed this fear when he said that “citizens who want the government to be accountable before the people (are) part of a soft war against the Islamic Republic.”
上述平台在“临时”或“按需”劳动力市场发挥的作用越来越大，上述市场被广泛定义为临时工市场或未与雇主签订标准兼职或全职合同的工作岗位。	Such platforms play a growing role in the market for “contingent” or “on-demand” workers, broadly defined as workers whose jobs are temporary and who do not have standard part-time or full-time contracts with employers.
比如说在2009年，核电站提供了2560太瓦时（TWh(e ) ， 电力学单位，1太瓦时=10亿千瓦时）的电能，比2008年降低了1.6 % ， 更比2006年的2658太瓦时下降了近4 % 。	During 2009, for example, nuclear power plants provided 2,560 TWh(e) (2,560 billion kWh) of electric energy, about 1.6% lower than during 2008 and almost 4% lower than during the record year of 2006, when 2,658 TWh(e) were produced.
针对二次公投的最强的反对意见是，至少在理论上，不同的计票体系可能得出截然不同的计票结果，从而破坏整个过程的合法性。	The strongest objection to a second referendum is that the different counting systems could give very different results, at least in theory, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the entire process.
此外，最穷新成员国的进步最大（这与老15国中最穷成员国形成了鲜明对比。 葡萄牙和希腊的收入水平已经倒退回20世纪90年代 ） 。	Moreover, the poorest new members gained the most (in contrast to the poorest members of the EU-15, like Portugal and Greece, which are now back to income levels last seen in the 1990’s).
美国也不应该因为盟友不对其言听计从而猛烈抨击，比如在英国宣布准备加入中国领导的新亚洲基础设施投资银行的时候。	Nor should it issue harsh rebukes to its allies when they do not follow suit, as it did when the United Kingdom announced its intention to join the new China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
为泰党支持者乐见能让他们发出政治声音 — — 事实上，还有可以预见的选民多数 — — 和保卫他们的权利的制度。	The PTP’s supporters are happy with a system that grants them a political voice – indeed, predictable electoral majorities – and that safeguards their rights.
中国最高领导层也承认需要做出改变 — — 这一信念在十八大三中全会后所发布的意义深远的改革计划中尽显无疑。	Even China’s top leadership acknowledges the need for change – a belief that culminated in the far-reaching reform agenda presented two months ago at the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party’s 18th Central Committee.
特朗普也想阻止中国对韩国的战略侵蚀；但正如他与习近平的会晤将要证明的那样，他和奥巴马同样面临着非常有限的选择。	Trump also wants to stop China’s strategic encroachments in the South China Sea; but, as his meeting with Xi will prove, his options are as limited as Obama’s were.
如今又有数千万人加入了原先数亿人的行列，生活在贫困线以下，这个状况显然同达成世界千年发展目标的进程背道而驰。	Tens of millions of people have been added to the hundreds of millions already below the poverty line, reversing progress toward attaining the world’s Millennium Development Goals.
就在Tingiri的办公室附件，卢旺达最大的电信公司Rwandatel，正在安装由深圳华为公司提供的新的无线通讯设备。	Near Tingiri’s office, Rwanda’s largest telecom company, Rwandatel, is installing new wireless telephony equipment made by Huawei of Shenzen.
这意味着遏制住一些冲动：试图美化那些用于不会真正兑现的未来行为，或推出一些令人印象深刻但缺乏现实效果的前瞻性计划。	This means resisting the urge to wax poetic about future actions that never actually materialize, or to roll out impressive-looking programs with few real-world effects.
最近，来自70多个国家的450多家组织签署了《罗佛敦宣言 》 （ Lofoten Declaration ） ， 宣言明确呼吁有序退出化石燃料行业。	Recently, over 450 organizations from more than 70 countries signed the Lofoten Declaration, which explicitly calls for the managed decline of the fossil-fuel sector.
所有这些都给了哈夫塔尔筹码，如今，他不会支持任何可能挑战他的利比亚国民军（Libyan National Army）和众议院权威的协定。	All of this gives Haftar leverage, and he would not support any agreement that would challenge his Libyan National Army or the House of Representatives’ authority.
这473个基因中的绝大部分负责家务整理：他们制造蛋白质、修复DNA，并负责维护细胞的细胞膜和细胞质。	Most of the 473 genes take care of housekeeping: They make proteins, keep DNA in good repair, and are responsible for the cell’s membrane and cytoplasm.
就这段历史来看，如今指责中国的汇率政策是有点卑鄙的。 中国的汇率政策使美国人能在这么长的时期内享受超出自己收入的生活水平。	Given this history, it is a bit shabby to reproach China now for its exchange-rate policy – a policy that enabled the US to live beyond its means for so long.
整套SDG中没有任何一处涉及到方兴未艾的连通性、信息和数据大爆炸在结束贫困方面可以起到怎样的革命性作用。	Nowhere in the document is there even a hint of the revolutionary role that the nascent explosion in connectivity, information, and data could play in ending poverty.
在此期间，我们教育了一小群年轻罗姆人，他们保持着自己的罗姆人身份，但仍能打破交际圈中对他们的敌意偏见。	Over that period, we have educated a small cohort of young Roma who retain their identity and yet can break the hostile stereotypes held by those with whom they interact.
在此我回想起了1978年时与波兰历史学家，政治家布罗尼斯拉夫·盖莱梅克（Bronisław Geremek）的一段对话 — — 当时我俩在华盛顿特区共享一间办公室。	Here I am reminded of a conversation with the Polish historian, statesman, and politician Bronisław Geremek in 1978, when we shared an office in Washington, DC.
此外，欧盟过去（而且现在仍然是）超国家层面唯一一项民主实验，尽管存在很多缺陷，但仍然因为拥有光明前途的进步而自豪着。	Meanwhile, the European Union remained (and remains) the only democratic experiment on a supranational level, taking pride in its promising advances, despite being burdened by multiple defects.
依然需要外国军队来帮助保护巴格达西部和伊拉克中部的逊尼派部落不受南部的什叶派侵犯，同时保护北部的库尔德人不会受到土耳其的干涉。	Foreign forces would still be needed to help protect the Sunni population west of Baghdad and in the middle of Iraq against the Shiite south, as well as in the Kurdish north to keep Turkey from intervening.
有了这样的工资补贴，竞争性力量将会让雇主们雇佣更多的工人，而随之而来的失业率降低将会让大多数补贴以直接或间接的劳动力补偿形式支付。	With such wage subsidies, competitive forces would cause employers to hire more workers, and the resulting fall in unemployment would cause most of the subsidy to be paid out as direct or indirect labor compensation.
我不知道具体哪个人适合哪种方法；要点在于让人们自由寻找自己的办法，而不是把他们束缚于某种新的“健康”协议，而不管是否适合。	I do not know the right approach for each person; the point is to liberate people to find their own path, not to chain them to some new “healthy” protocol that may or may not suit them.
虽然有国际社会的关注，但是缅甸的将军们依然在成千上万的热带风暴幸存者急切需要住所，清洁的饮用水和医疗护理的时候，加强他们的残暴统治。	While the world watches, Burma's generals are consolidating their tyrannical rule as hundreds of thousands of the cyclone’s survivors remain in desperate need of shelter, clean drinking water and medical care.
新组建的五星运动/联盟党政府很有可能要求修改欧盟都柏林条例，上述条例规定，庇护寻求者的申诉通常由他或她首次登陆的欧盟成员国负责处理。	A new M5S/League government would most likely demand changes to the EU’s Dublin Regulation, according to which the EU member state where an asylum seeker first sets foot is usually responsible for processing his or her claim.
在布宜诺斯艾利斯省（近40%的阿根廷选民居住在该省 ） ， 与马克里同属一党的玛利亚·尤金尼亚·比达尔（María Eugenia Vidal）大胜克里斯蒂娜·基什内尔的前任幕僚长，成为该省首任女省长。	In Buenos Aires Province, home to nearly 40% of Argentina’s voters, María Eugenia Vidal, a 42-year-old from Macri’s party, soundly defeated Cristina Kirchner’s former chief of staff to become the province’s first woman governor.
更早的预警提示，正如20国峰会所要求的，IMF应该监督各国的政策制订者，让他们对IMF的建议有所重视。	Early warnings, commissioned by the G20, should be specific and the IMF should monitor whether policymakers give follow-up to the Fund’s advice.
联邦公开市场委员会从第一轮量化宽松（在危机恐怖情绪达到顶峰时大规模注入流动性）的成功中感受到虚假的安全感，从而错误地相信已经找到了后续政策行动的正确模式。	The FOMC, drawing a false sense of comfort from the success of QE1 – a massive liquidity injection in the depths of a horrific crisis – mistakenly came to believe that it had found the right template for subsequent policy actions.
有才干的墨西哥技术官僚 — — 大多在美国接受训练 — — 对墨西哥宏观经济框架进行了大量改进，也帮助墨西哥抵御了最近的经济风暴。	Talented Mexican technocrats, most of them trained in the US, have made substantial improvements to the country’s macroeconomic framework, and helped it weather recent storms.
国际卫生组织估计每年大约总计为63000的移植手术中，有5%到10%发生在中国、巴基斯坦、埃及、哥伦比亚和东欧最下层的诊所里。	The World Health Organization estimates that 5% to 10% of all transplants performed annually – perhaps 63,000 in all – take place in the clinical netherworlds of China, Pakistan, Egypt, Colombia, and Eastern Europe.
比如，2011年3月通过的十二五规划承诺中国经济将进入消费拉动时代，建立在城镇化和方兴未艾的服务部门的发展的基础上。	For example, the 12th Five-Year Plan, adopted in March 2011, promised the emergence of a consumer-led economy, resting on the building blocks of urbanization and the development of an embryonic services sector.
美联储主席珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）在用来描述政策正常化的时间路径的“相当长时间”的定义上纠缠不清，实际上也在滑向同样的陷阱。	By splitting hairs over the meaning of the words “considerable time” in describing the expected timeline for policy normalization, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is falling into the same trap.
在英国，在针对脱盟问题辩论了三个月之后，只有37%的选民同意英国经济将在脱盟后变得更糟 — — 比一年前的38%还少。	In Britain, after three months of debate about Brexit, only 37% of voters agree that Britain would be worse off economically if it left the EU – down from 38% a year ago.
民主主义不仅由于其在危机爆发时期反应时间过慢而备受打击；而且当人们想要对将来制定长期的计划时，把自身因素考虑进去的时候，所面临的困难也使民主遭到不小的冲击。	Democracies suffer not only from their slow reaction time at moments of crisis, but also from the difficulty that they face in projecting themselves into the future and planning for the long term.
因此，除非自由民主党人能够重振声威，否则英国可能需要一个新的政党（或跨党派联盟）去为一个外向型，自由和宽容的国家而奋斗。	So, unless the Liberal Democrats can bounce back, Britain may need a new political party (or cross-party alliance) to fight for a country that is outward-looking, liberal, and tolerant.
更糟糕的是，发达国家公司可以在成员国设立分支，通过这些分支回国投资然后起诉，以此作为规避监管的新方法。	Worse still, corporations in advanced countries can create subsidiaries in member countries through which to invest back home, and then sue, giving them a new channel to bloc regulations.
很久以来，古巴关塔那摩湾的战俘营成为了闻所未闻的象征，也就是不经审判逮捕被剥夺所有人权的“非法战斗人员 ” 。	From an early date, the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba became the symbol of something unheard of: the arrest without trial of “illegal combatants” who are deprived of all human rights.
马萨诸塞州参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦（Elizabeth Warren）和西弗吉尼亚州参议员乔·曼勤（Joe Manchin）令人十分信服地指出，美联储理事会的构成应该将与华尔街大公司有关联的人剔除。	Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Joe Manchin of West Virginia argue, entirely convincingly, that the composition of the Fed’s Board of Governors should be tilted away from people who are connected with big Wall Street firms.
随便问一个斯洛伐克、爱沙尼亚或立陶宛的街头民众，你听到的反应不会和拉脱维亚退休者有多大区别 ： “ 我们接受了教训，为何希腊人不能接受同样的教训 ？ ”	Ask the average person on the street in Slovakia, Estonia, or Lithuania, and you are likely to get a response not too different from this one from a Latvian pensioner: “We learned our lesson – why can’t the Greeks learn the same lesson?”
因为在某些国家虽然结构上的问题削弱了竞争力，减慢了国内生产总值的增长，但它不会引起危机，解决结构上的问题并不能解决危机。	While structural problems have weakened competitiveness and GDP growth in particular countries, they did not bring about the crisis, and addressing them will not resolve it.
毕竟，除了当前全球经济体系重新制度化后的冷酷无情所带来的种种社会不幸之外，如今全世界所面临的最大危险，就是这个体系与生俱来的不稳定性。	After all, beyond the social misery produced by the re-institutionalized cruelty of the current global economic system, the greatest danger facing the world nowadays is that very system’s inherent instability.
可是今天，很难再找到不承认欧元是个巨大成功的人。 欧洲央行一直走得很稳，以至于人们认为它的成功理所当然地来之毫不费力。	Today, however, it is hard to find anybody who does not consider the euro a great success, and the ECB has been so sure-footed that people now take that success for granted.
作为回应，美国和其他发达国家应该将今年的剩余时光用于成立GFE，将今天用于军事支出的钱拿来为GFE提供资金。	In response, the US and other rich countries should move this year to create the GFE, with the needed funds shifted from today’s military spending.
其次，必须用一种平和的态度来处理今日的危机，这也是我们在1989年时的目标 — — 这在异见人士希望通过谈判协商来寻求政权更替的惊天构想中可见一斑。	Second, the crisis of today must be managed in a peaceful manner, which was also our goal in 1989 – reflected in dissidents’ startling idea of regime change through negotiation.
但拉兹·切提及其同事的最近一项突破性研究表明尽管二十世纪四十年代早期出生的美国成年人90%收入均高于其父母，但这一比例从那以后就一直呈稳定下降趋势，到二十世纪八十年代中期下降到50 % 。	But recent path-breaking research by Raj Chetty and his colleagues shows that whereas 90% of US adults born in the early 1940s earned more than their parents, this proportion has steadily declined ever since, to 50% for those born in the mid-1980s.
考虑到这些风险重新恢复了暴力，以色列的地区伙伴和国际行动者们应该懂得巴勒斯坦人不会偏离他们要建立一个独立国家的战略目标，这一点十分重要。	Given that this risks renewed violence, it is critical that Israel’s regional partners and international actors understand that Palestinians will not be diverted from their strategic objective of achieving an independent state.
在我最近对这两地的走访当中，尽管多次联系，没有一位当地政治家或者卫生官员愿意出面会见我，我回国后又尝试用电话，传真或者电子邮件等方式联系他们，但得到的依旧是沉默的回应。	On a recent trip to these countries, and despite repeated requests, no politician or public-health official in either country would meet with me. None returned the phone calls, faxes, or e-mails that I sent after I returned home.
从长期看，任何对穆斯林兄弟会的镇压都会导致其成员和支持者 — — 目前他们已经对民主失望透顶 — — 彻底拒绝选举。	In the long term, any crackdown on the Brotherhood would lead its members and supporters – already bitterly disappointed in democracy – to reject elections entirely.
尽管如此，占主导地位的是对个人自由的渴望、对多样化的接受、对环境的深忧，以及对从上而下“被组织”的拒绝。	Nonetheless, what dominates is a desire for individual freedom, an acceptance of diversity, great concern for the environment, and a refusal to be “organized” from above.
进一步提振大宗商品价格前景的是其他新兴巨人 — — 如印度和印度尼西亚 — — 未来几年很有可能加速。	Bolstering prospects for commodity prices further is the promise that demand in other emerging giants, such as India and Indonesia, will accelerate in the coming years.
发自普林斯顿 — — 每年2月笔者都要在普林斯顿大学开设一门叫“电磁导论”的课程，并且在第一堂课上告诉学生们：正是在本学期所讲到的内容奠定了现代文明.	PRINCETON – Each February, I begin the introductory electricity and magnetism course at Princeton University by telling my students that the material we will cover during the semester provides the basis for modern civilization.
比如，美元急剧升值10%将在此后2—3个季度内累计造成非燃料进口品通胀下降4.4 % ， 但此后对通胀的影响便可忽略不计。	A sharp 10% appreciation of the US dollar, for example, would reduce inflation for non-fuel imports by 4.4% cumulatively over the next 2-3 quarters, but would have only a negligible impact on inflation after that point.
因此，复苏的关键在于对富人增税，增加转移支付，并通过加强工会讨价还价能力和提高最低工资重振工人收入。	The key to recovery, then, is to tax the rich, increase transfers, and restore worker incomes by enhancing union bargaining power and raising minimum wages.
欧盟的伽利略卫星计划被计划用来替代美国全球定位系统。 去年12月，其首颗卫星升空，印度就是一个全面伙伴。	The first EU Galileo satellite – intended as an alternative to America’s GPS system – was launched in late December with India as a full partner.
亚沙·芒克（Yascha Mounk）和罗伯托·斯特凡·佛阿（Roberto Stefan Foa）在《外交事务 》 （ Foreign Affairs）杂志上的文章中指出，西方自由民主占据世界最强文化和经济力量的时代也许即将结束了。	Writing in Foreign Affairs, Yascha Mounk and Roberto Stefan Foa argue that the era when Western liberal democracies were the world’s top cultural and economic powers may be drawing to a close.
"当共产主义崩溃后，他又将改革进程中的一切弊病归咎于""外国人 "" - 即西方、罗马尼亚的匈牙利少数民族，特别是犹太人。"	"When communism collapsed, he blamed every shortcoming in the reform process on ""foreigners"" - meaning the West, Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority, and especially the Jews."
新兴市场心态的这一变化被20世纪90年代末及21世纪初爆发于亚洲、东欧和拉美的金融危机强化了，这些地区中的很多国家对西方设计缺陷明显的不给力的反应机制十分失望。	This change in sentiment was catalyzed by the financial crises in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, and by what many in these regions regarded as the West’s inadequate and poorly designed responses.
尽管对银行的冲击是对经济的冲击的结果而非原因，但人们对这一点毫不在意：恢复货币和银行秩序，他们认为，就会让冲击停止。	Although the shocks to banking were the effect, not the cause, of shocks to the economy, this was ignored: Restore money and banking to order, the argument went, and shocks would stop.
我们必须面对现实：人们如此渴望回归的宁静世界 — — 欧盟、联合国甚至是民族国家建立前的世界 — — 从来就没有存在过。	Let’s face it: the halcyon world to which many people are so eager to return – before, say, the European Union or the United Nations or even the nation-state – never really existed.
为了降低金融业风险（包括杠杆率过高和影子银行问题 ） ， 银行和保险监管被整合为新的中国银行保险监督管理委员会。	Likewise, in order to reduce financial-sector risks (including excessive leverage and shadow banking), regulation of banking and insurance have been consolidated under the new China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.
一些MOOC具有广泛的吸引力，如西班牙阿利坎特大学（University of Alicante）和德国洪堡研究所（Hunboldt Institute）的课程，这两家机构都提供关于创业的实践层面的课程。	Some MOOCs have mass appeal, like those from the University of Alicante in Spain and the Humboldt Institute in Germany, both of which offer courses on the practical aspects of starting up a business.
虽然英国、荷兰、德国、法国和其它一些欧洲国家的国民也都慷慨解囊，但如果就捐助的现金数量来看，美国国民的个人募捐确实超出了其政府的援助金额 ― ― 尽管美国的税收政策并没有起到鼓励个人募捐的作用。	Depending on what monies are included, this is true, although the British, Dutch, Germans, French, and other Europeans are also generous donors, despite lacking the tax benefits that encourage private philanthropy in the US.
美日之间的差别 — — 贸易赤字对贸易盈余 — — 已不再重要，因为中国的货币政策使其不断地积累着美元资产。	The big difference – that Japan has a trade surplus and the US has a deficit – is not important as long as China’s currency policy obliges it to accumulate dollar assets in one form or another.
拙劣的教育和高企的年轻人失业构成了致命组合，让数百万年轻人在美利坚大学（American University）教授戴安妮·辛格曼（Diane Singerman）所谓的“等待期 ” （ waithood）炼狱中饱受煎熬。	This toxic combination of poor education and high youth unemployment leaves millions of young people lingering in a purgatory that American University professor Diane Singerman calls “waithood.”
但是科恩（以及欧盟）面对的问题是：这种程度的支持似乎并不会转化成投票箱里的赞成票。 在过去三次针对欧盟��约的投票中，爱尔兰人两次都投的死反对票。	But the problem for Cowen (and for the EU) is that this level of support does not seem to translate to the ballot box: the Irish rejected EU treaties on two of the last three occasions when they were asked to vote.
当市场趋于正常之时，投资者肯定会环顾四周，并意识到美国为了抗击经济衰退已经大大增加了其债务，增量可能达到数万亿美元。	As markets normalize, surely investors will look around and realize that the US has vastly increased its debt in fighting the downturn, possibly by several trillion dollars.
贷款补贴能帮助交易部门保持“竞争力 ” ， 也能成为撬动额外资源流入教育的杠杆，若无贷款补贴，资本紧缺国家或许不愿意将资源贷给教育。	Loan buy-downs can help keep the education sector “competitive,” and could prove to be a mechanism to leverage extra resources for education, for which capital-strapped countries may not be willing to borrow otherwise.
此外，北约在吸收更多会员国的同时，也把自身从一个反共产主义的防御性联盟逐渐演化为一个进攻性组织（在南斯拉夫、伊拉克和阿富汗发起军事行动 ） 。	NATO, moreover, not only enlarged its membership, but also transformed itself from an anti-Communist defensive alliance into an offensive grouping (with operations in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan).
9月，联合国人权和反恐特别书记员埃莫森（Ben Emmerson）报告说美国在巴基斯坦造成了至少400平民死亡，另有200名被杀者“可能并非战斗人员 ” 。	In September, Ben Emmerson, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, reported that the US had caused at least 400 civilian deaths in Pakistan, with another 200 of those killed being “probable noncombatants.”
由于SWFs的资源非常雄厚，所以从理论上将它们应该未雨绸缪避免成为政治性市场操纵的目标，或避免在经济和心理上依赖外国政府的决策。	Because SWFs’ resources are so substantial, it is advisable to take precautions to avoid becoming a target of politically motivated market manipulation, or becoming economically and psychologically dependent on foreign governments’ decisions.
俄罗斯明确宣布它是维持现状（status quo）的大国，与“修正主义 ” （ revisionist）的美国相反。 美国寻求通过促进制度演变动摇世界，特别是阿拉伯世界。	Pointedly, Russia claims that it is a status quo power, contrasting itself with the US, which it calls a “revisionist” power seeking to destabilize the world by promoting regime change, especially in the Arab world.
近几年来，农地产出频创新高，从2005—2006年的2.8亿吨增加到2013—2014年的2.63亿吨（预计值 ） 。	Farm output has been setting new records in recent years, having increased output from 208 million tons in 2005-2006 to an estimated 263 million tons in 2013-2014.
随着政治改革取得进展，以色列将无法继续以中东唯一的民主国家自居，随着局势的发展变化，对巴勒斯坦独立呼声充耳不闻的难度将越来越大。	As political reform achieves results, Israel will no longer be able to claim that it is the only democracy in the Middle East; with conditions changing on the ground, it will be increasingly difficult to ignore Palestinians’ demand for independence.
但我们必须正视现实：意大利在八国集团中存在近乎荒谬，再加上中国、印度、巴西等国没有正式的代表席位，这种情况再也无法被人们所接受。	But let’s be reasonable: the absurdity of Italy’s presence in the G-8, together with the lack of official membership for countries such as China, India, and Brazil, is no longer acceptable or tenable.
但是要说我们不应该在这一领域进行研究就是相当于说我们应该拒绝对不同种族或族裔人们之间收入、教育以及健康差异进行开放心态的调查研究。	Yet to say that we should not carry out research in this area is equivalent to saying that we should reject open-minded investigation of the causes of inequalities in income, education, and health between people of different racial or ethnic groups.
但是，更有吸引力的是有可能以此追踪自己或他人在长期和多领域的学术影响力，并找到被引用最多的科学家、论文、期刊和机构。	More appealing, however, was the possibility of tracking the scholarly influence of oneself and others over time and across fields, and identifying the most highly cited scientists, papers, journals, and institutions.
诺贝尔经济学早就授予过给一些可被归类为行为经济学家的人，包括乔治·阿卡洛夫（George Akerlof ） ， 罗伯特·福格尔（Robert Fogel ） ， 丹尼尔·卡尼曼（Daniel Kahneman ） ， 埃里诺·奥斯特伦（Elinor Ostrom）和我本人。	The economics Nobel has already been awarded to a number of people who can be classified as behavioral economists, including George Akerlof, Robert Fogel, Daniel Kahneman, Elinor Ostrom, and me.
卡塔尔和沙特阿拉伯也为叙利亚反对派团体运送武器，但阿拉伯联盟和海湾合作委员会都陷入到瘫痪境地而无法自拔。	Qatar and Saudi Arabia are also sending arms to Syrian opposition groups, but the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council are paralyzed.
作为一名在独立运动中为女权斗争、并且为开创印度第一个妇女机构立下汗马功劳的女子的女儿，我应当为帕蒂尔当选感到由衷的骄傲。	As a daughter of a woman who fought for women’s rights during the independence movement and was instrumental in starting one of the first women’s institutions in India, I should feel a genuine sense of pride in the election of Patil.
商业贷款利率高达18 % ， 这导致法郎区私人部门信用量降至GDP的12.7 % ， 而撒哈拉以南非洲地区为36.5 % ， 南非（地区领先经济体）为78.9 % 。	With the commercial lending rate at a high of 18%, bank credit to the franc zone’s private sector has dropped to 12.7% of GDP, compared to 36.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa and 78.9% in South Africa, the region’s leading economy.
加剧巴黎悲剧的最佳办法莫过于用《查理周刊》编辑查波涅尔（Stéphane Charbonnier）和其他11人的死煽动宗教仇恨之火。	The easiest way to compound the tragedy in Paris would be to use the deaths of Charlie Hebdo’s editor, Stéphane Charbonnier, and 11 others to fan the flames of religious hatred.
这似乎不是一个显而易见的问题，但你不妨想想，对新兴市场投资者来说，艺术品已经成为方便资本逃离和隐藏财富的关键工具。	That might not seem like an obvious question, until one considers that, for emerging-market investors, art has become a critical tool for facilitating capital flight and hiding wealth.
实现这一目标的一个可能方法是建立独立的委员会，这使欧盟所谓的财政契约现在对欧元区的所有国家都有约束力。	One possible vehicle for accomplishing this is the independent councils that the EU’s so-called fiscal compact has now made mandatory for every country in the eurozone.
最后，大部分朝鲜军事人员（目前占总劳动人口的超过8.5 % ） 都可以投入到更加由建设性的活动当中。	To this end, a significant share of North Korea’s military manpower, which currently amounts to more than 8.5% of the total labor force, could be used for more productive purposes.
富人的所得很大一部分通过资本利得获得，而如果资本利得税率比其他所得税率更低，将加剧不平等性，导致扭曲。	The rich receive a disproportionately large share of their income through capital gains, and to tax capital gains at rates lower than other forms of income exacerbates inequality and leads to distortions.
为了回答这个问题，很重要的一点是区分在公共争论中常被混为一谈的两个问题：针对外国实体的电子间谍和针对政府本国人民的国内监控。	To answer that question, it is important to distinguish between two issues that have become conflated in public debate: electronic espionage against foreign entities and domestic surveillance of a government’s own citizens.
按照这种思路，如果机构投资者拒绝持有股票超过几个月，首席执行官为公司制定的运营时间周期也会缩短到大概同样的范围。	If institutional investors refuse to hold stocks for more than a few months, the thinking goes, CEOs’ time horizons for corporate planning must shrink to roughly the same timeframe.
也许在财政契约实施的情况下，它会有助于这些规则在国家层面上被采纳，而不像《稳定与增长公约》在超国家的层面上运作。	Perhaps it will help that, under the fiscal compact, the rules are to be adopted at the national level, as opposed to the SGP, which operated on the supranational level.
毫无疑问，以过时且过分严格的规则去强行与欧元区最为民粹 — — 也最受欢迎 — — 的政府对抗的确是相当愚蠢的。	To force a confrontation with the eurozone’s most populist – and popular – government in the name of outdated, overly rigid rules would be stupid indeed.
多年来特朗普一直沉迷于一个怪异的阴谋论，正如他在2012年所描述的那样 ： “ 全球变暖就是一个中国人创造出来好让美国制造业丧失竞争力的概念 ” 。	For years, Trump has indulged the strange conspiracy theory that, as he put it in 2012, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.”
在证据的基础上，高威国立大学的 研究者们发现这些模式可以移植到安得拉邦。 安得拉邦有170万15—59岁年龄段妇女生活在贫困线以下，并在过去的一年内有伴侣。	Based on the evidence, the NUI Galway researchers find that these models could be adapted for Andhra Pradesh, where 1.7 million women aged 15-59 live below the poverty line and have been in a partnership within the past year.
卡拉季奇被判无罪恰恰因为他还在为与同样暴行有关的其他罪名受审，而这是实现取消种族灭绝罪名目标的一次合理的机会。	Karadžić’s acquittal – precisely because he is still on trial on other counts related to the same atrocities – is an opportunity to move toward the sensible goal of retiring it.
同样，朝鲜几乎世界最糟的人权纪录必须在未来某个时间被提及 — — 也许就像我在六方会谈中所表述的那样，要纳入最终的美朝外交关系。	Similarly, North Korea’s human rights record, one of the world’s worst, will have to be taken up in the future – perhaps, as I signaled during the six-party talks, as a component of eventual diplomatic relations.
最后，德国、西班牙、意大利和一些北欧国家出于国内政治原因要求对公开违抗欧盟机构和紧缩要求的希腊政客和选民给予形式羞辱（ritual humiliation ） 。	Finally, Germany, Spain, Italy, and several northern European countries required, for domestic political reasons, a ritual humiliation of radical Greek politicians and voters who openly defied EU institutions and austerity demands.
事实上，托马斯·萨金特（Thomas Sargent）去年获得诺贝尔奖之后，在获奖演说中援引了汉密尔顿的举措作为先例。	Indeed, after Thomas Sargent won the Nobel Prize in Economics last year, he cited it as a precedent in his acceptance speech.
上个月在拜欧拉大学 — — 一个位于南加州的教会学院，我和保守的评论员丹尼希·杜泽（Dinesh D’Souza）就上帝是否存在的问题进行了辩论。	Last month, at Biola University, a Christian college in southern California, I debated the existence of God with the conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza.
这就是为什么在今后几年中消除消费偏见必定是最优先事项，也需要一些变革来确保电动车的使用和销售量继续增长。	That is why addressing consumption bias must be the highest priority over the next few years. Several changes are needed to ensure that growth in EV usage and sales continues.
由于美国的国外资产相当于其GDP的140 ％ ， 其外债相当于GDP的180 ％ ， 美元升值20％将导致相当于GDP13％的资本损失。	With US foreign assets amounting to 140% of its GDP, and its foreign liabilities amounting to 180% of GDP, a dollar appreciation of 20% would result in a capital loss equal to about 13% of GDP.
但即使是欧元区，GDP增长也略高于潜在水平（平心而论，其潜在水平相当低迷 ） ， 因此，依然存在的产出缺口正在逐渐填��。	But even in the eurozone, GDP growth is slightly above its (admittedly very meager) potential, so that the remaining output gap is being closed gradually.
但是，如果这种监管是分散，笨拙，粗暴或者缺乏一致性，那么对经济一体化 — — 反以及繁荣 — — 所产生的负面后果可能极为严重。	But if that regulation is fragmented, clumsy, heavy-handed, or inconsistent, the consequences for economic integration – and, in turn, prosperity – could be severe.
考虑到中东及北非地区难民危机的规模和持续时间，显然需要找到一种从临时向半永久性解决方案过渡的新方法。	Given the scale and duration of MENA’s refugee crisis, it is clear that a new approach is needed, one that shifts the focus from temporary to semi-permanent solutions.
“她真是个可人儿 ， ” 据报道他曾这样对助手说。 当时他一只手握着电话，听着她在伦敦向他斥责美国的政策失误。	“Isn’t she wonderful,” he is reported to have said to an aide, one hand over the telephone, as she scolded him from London for some US policy error.
还有一个不应该轻易忽视的因素 — — 犬儒主义批评家经常忽视它：伊朗领导人出于宗教立场一再拒绝大规模杀伤性武器。	And there is another factor that should not be instantly dismissed, as it usually is by cynical critics: Iranian leaders’ repeated strong rejection of weapons of mass destruction on religious grounds.
在2008年危机之前，大银行经营不善 — — 表现为狂妄、无能、过度负债的危险组合 — — 二如今，它们的治理问题更要重于2005或2007年。	The biggest banks were badly run in the years leading up to the crisis of 2008 – exhibiting a toxic mixture of hubris, incompetence, and excessive leverage – and their governance problems today are worse than they were in 2005 or 2007.
地势低洼的孟加拉国是最容易受到气候变化影响的国家之一，其政府支持在毗邻孙德尔本斯（Sundarbans）世界遗产地的地区兴建两座巨型煤电厂。	In low-lying Bangladesh, one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, the government supports a proposal to build two huge coal-fired power plants adjacent to the Sundarbans World Heritage site.
首先，如果“软实力”意味着因“他人欲你之所欲 ” （ 约瑟夫·奈（Joseph Nye）语）而施加影响，那么全世界女性之所欲乃美国女权主义者已为之奋斗了三代人的东西。	First, if “soft power” means exercising influence because “others want what you want,” as Joseph Nye puts it, then women the world over want what American feminists began fighting for three generations ago.
改革监管法规应该遵循以下三个原则，首先，也是最重要的一点是，金融监管机构必须承担起责任，在市场繁荣的时候防止资产泡沫的出现。	Three principles should guide reform. First and foremost, financial authorities must accept responsibility for preventing asset bubbles from growing too big.
自民党的安倍晋三很可能成为下一任日本首相，他已承诺将在钓鱼岛问题上和其他对中纠纷中采取更强硬的立场。	Shinzo Abe of the Liberal Democratic Party, who is likely to become Japan’s next prime minister, has vowed to take a tougher line on Senkaku and other disputes with China.
尽管受抑制的流动性和信用增长推迟了美联储扩张银行已然相当庞大的准备金规模的决定的通胀性效果，但美国不可能永远逃脱通胀。	While subdued liquidity and credit growth are delaying the inflationary impact of the Fed’s determination to expand banks’ already-massive reserves, America cannot escape inflation forever.
具体就中国来说，该叙事围绕着“一个世纪的屈辱史 ” — —当年的中国是如此积弱，甚至无力阻止自身主权惨遭侵犯 — — 因此我们的国家再也不能向别人卑躬屈膝了。	In China’s case, the narrative revolves around “the century of shame,” when China was too weak to defend itself against encroachments on its sovereignty, and the idea that it should never have to succumb again.
此外，这些国家应该致力于巩固国际法治精神 — — 这个概念让波顿恨不得拔枪相向 — — 致力于强化联合国、世界银行和国际货币基金组织。	Moreover, these countries should work to fortify the international rule of law – a concept that makes Bolton reach for his gun – by committing to strengthen the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.
这一幕在上月我读到蔡美儿（Amy Chua）在华尔街日报上发表的文章《中国妈妈为何更卓越》时又浮现在了脑海。	I was reminded of that moment last month when I read Amy Chua’s Wall Street Journal article, “Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior,” which sparked more than 4,000 comments on wsj.com and over 100,000 comments on Facebook.
他们的合法性和影响力并不取决于赢得选举多数，而是取决于与军队、官僚和司法系统的强大联盟，他们联合起来捍卫着以国王为最高层的传统层级制。	Its legitimacy and influence depend not on winning electoral majorities, but on its strong alliances with the military, bureaucracy, and judiciary in defense of a traditional hierarchy that places the king at its apex.
这些国家面临两难。 要防止公债息差过度扩大就必须实施财政巩固政策，但其中的增税和削减政府开支等措施在短期内会引起紧缩效果。	The dilemma is that, whereas fiscal consolidation is necessary to prevent an unsustainable increase in the spread on sovereign bonds, the short-run effects of raising taxes and cutting government spending tend to be contractionary.
鉴于如果未来需求居高不下，民用航空业截止2050年的排放量将接近今天俄罗斯和印度两国的排放之和，因此这一进展无疑极为重要。	Given that, in a high-demand scenario, the industry would be emitting by 2050 almost as much CO2 as Russia and India combined emit today, this is a hugely important development.
题为《这是真主的承诺 》 （ “This is the Promise of Allah ” ） 的新哈里发帝国建国宣言发布于伊斯兰神圣的斋月的第一天，并提出了重组阿拉伯世界的激进愿景。	The statement announcing the new caliphate, entitled “This is the Promise of Allah,” was issued on the first day of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, and lays out a radical vision for reconfiguring the Arab world.
纵使中国在开发阿富汗自然资源方面的投资已达数十亿美元之巨，却依然难以观察到一个涵盖范围更广且更为主动的参与性政策。	But, despite the billions of dollars China has invested in developing Afghanistan’s natural resources, it is hard to see it undertaking a policy of broader and proactive engagement there.
一个种族否决权已经使得中央政府长期陷于瘫痪，而就在最近，塞族控制的政治实体塞族共和国的领导人 米洛拉德·多迪克则用发动独立全民公决的威胁来回应改革的要求	An ethnic veto has long made the central government ineffective, and, most recently, Milorad Dodik, the leader of the Serb-controlled entity, Republika Srpska, has responded to efforts at reform with a threat to hold a referendum on independence.
但是俄罗斯帝国主义内在的反自由主义并不局限于其最近的行为，更令人担忧的是，它延伸到了格鲁吉亚领土完整的问题上，因为俄罗斯的军队不断地支持想要脱离联邦的那些地区。	But the illiberalism inherent in Russian imperialism is not limited to recent behavior, and, more disturbingly, it extends to the question of Georgia’s territorial integrity, as Russian troops continue to prop up secessionist regions.
首先，美国给以色列的进攻予以合法化并且把责任全部推到哈马斯身上，正如以前它把所有的责任都算在阿拉法特和法塔赫头上一样。	First, the United States justified the Israeli assault and blamed everything on Hamas, just as it used to pin all responsibility for whatever went wrong on Yasir Arafat and Fatah.
特朗普一开始似乎渴望遏制中国的霸权野心，而如今好像准备对中国做出更多让步，这将重蹈奥巴马啊政府的主要外交政策错误，有过之而无不及。	Trump, who initially seemed eager to challenge China’s hegemonic ambitions, now seems poised to cede more ground to the country, compounding a major foreign-policy mistake on the part of the Obama administration.
如果是这样，今天创造类似的机会可以改变激励，触发所需要的补充性改革，让全球经济走上更坚挺的长期复苏之路。	If so, creating a similar opportunity today could change the incentives, trigger the required complementary reforms, and put the global economy on course to a stronger long-term recovery.
叙利亚国内及其周边国家遍布着众多派别，从决议实现停火和政治和解可能需要好几年 — — 就连这也有可能过于乐观。	Given the many divisions both within Syria and among its neighbors, getting from the resolution to a cease-fire and political settlement is likely to take years – and even that assessment may prove to be overly optimistic.
经济一体化和全球化并不严格相等，但它们都建立在李嘉图贸易自由化原理之上 — — 这些原理在政治领域不受待见。	Economic integration and globalization are not exactly the same thing, but they rest on the same Ricardian principles of trade liberalization – principles that are falling on deaf ears in the political arena.
相反，普京的俄罗斯加入了世界贸易组织，而埃尔多安也从未质疑土耳其与欧盟的关税同盟，即使土耳其与欧盟的关系越来越恶化。	On the contrary, Putin’s Russia joined the World Trade Organization; and Erdoğan has never called into question Turkey’s customs union with the European Union, even though bilateral relations with the EU have gone from bad to worse.
通过制度上的借鉴和创造性的适应过程，成功的经济制度以及前沿技术得以向全世界扩散，从而促进了全球经济增长。	Through a process of institutional borrowing and creative adaptation, successful economic institutions and cutting-edge technologies spread around the world, and thereby boost global growth.
虽然似乎在过去十年内没有像来自太空的第一张地球照片那样具有强烈冲击力的画面，��是，请再仔细想一想。	While it may seem that no image in the last decade was so dramatic as the first photo of the earth from space, think again.
出现这一状况的原因似乎是英国制造业的大规模收缩 — — 从1978年占总增加值约28％到今天的不足10 ％ 。	The reason appears to be the massive contraction of the UK manufacturing sector – from around 28% of gross value added in 1978 to less than 10% today.
与一战后的时期一样，工人看到他们自己被全球化所抛下，政治领导人牺牲他们的利益满足养肥了金融家和大企业。	As in the post-WWI period, workers came to see themselves as left behind by globalization, with political leaders favoring financiers and big business at their expense.
印度有“发展中世界药厂”之称，是全球最大的成品药出口国之一，而这些药品成分中有70—78%为中国生产。	India, hailed as “the pharmacy to the developing world,” is one of the largest exporters of finished drugs, while China produces 70-80% of these drugs’ active ingredients.
黎凡特的状况尤其令人触目惊心。 黎凡特良好的交通状况和贸易改革曾经强化了伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩和叙利亚之间的经济联系。	The consequences are being felt most acutely in the Levant, where improved transport and trade reforms had strengthened economic ties between Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.
2012年中共十八大召开后不久，据说托克维尔写于1856年的著作《旧制度与大革命》成为中共高级干部的“必读书 ” 。	Shortly after the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, it was reported that Alexis de Tocqueville’s The Old Regime and the Revolution, written in 1856, had become a “must-read” for senior CCP cadres.
技术同样也是如此，现在可以通过视频会议、数字平台、在线劳动力交流和其他应用程序来实现虚拟的人才流动。	So, too, does technology, which now allows for virtual talent mobility through video conferencing, digital platforms, online labor exchanges, and other applications.
实际上，占领一个四分五裂的国家本身就非常棘手，像阿布格莱布和哈迪塞这样的事件几乎肯定会发生，它们使美国在伊拉克、乃至全球的吸引力都大受影响。	Indeed, occupying a divided nation is messy, and it is bound to produce episodes like Abu Ghraib and Haditha, which undercut America’s attractiveness not just in Iraq, but around the world.
几天前有报道称，约10 000名叙利亚士兵倒戈，其中数百人加入了自由叙利亚军（Free Syrian Army）和自由军官运动（Free Officers Movement）等运动。	And a few days ago, it was reported that some 10,000 Syrian soldiers had defected, with several hundred joining rival movements such as the Free Syrian Army and the Free Officers Movement.
但大部分工人并未参与到这些计划中，而最大的受益者则是CEO和高层管理者，他们的收入大头与生产率挂钩，反映在利润和股票表现中。	But most workers are not covered by such plans, and the biggest beneficiaries have been CEOs and top managers, a significant fraction of whose pay is tied to productivity, as reflected in profits and stock performance.
利比里亚、几内亚和塞拉利昂的埃博拉危机期间，五百万孩子就读的学校被关门或无法以足够快的速度重新开门，同样表明建立这一人道主义基金的紧迫性。	What has happened during the Ebola crisis in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone – where schools serving five million children remain closed or have not reopened quickly enough – makes this case, too.
发自新加坡 — — 对所谓超级真菌（对许多或所有抗生素都具备抗药性的致病微生物）不断涌现的警告在近年来日益频密。	SINGAPORE – Warnings of the rise of so-called superbugs – disease-causing microbes that are resistant to many (or all) antibiotics – have been coming thick and fast in recent years.
虽然阿根廷和南欧经济体有着明显的区别，但阿根廷汇率过山车事件为欧洲的领导层提供了一个值得深思的借鉴。	Despite Argentina’s obvious differences from the eurozone’s troubled southern economies, the Argentine currency rollercoaster provides sobering lessons for European policymakers to ponder.
发自剑桥 — — 经济学的历史在很大程度上就是两种对立思想流派 — — “自由主义”和“重商主义 ” — —之间的斗争史。	CAMBRIDGE – The history of economics is largely a struggle between two opposing schools of thought, “liberalism” and “mercantilism.”
实际上，从1991年国际收支平衡危机爆发以来，印度一直在摈弃其社会主义遗产而且其年度经济增长率达到7.5 ％ ， 只比中国略低。	Indeed, since 1991, when a balance-of-payments crisis loomed, India has been shedding its socialist legacies and posting 7.5% average annual GDP growth – only marginally slower than China.
在美国，所谓的自由建制派认定他们被“可怜之徒”的暴乱所劫。 这群可怜之徒从普京的黑客和Facebook的罪恶的内部操作那里获得力量。	In the United States, the so-called liberal establishment is convinced it was robbed by an insurgency of “deplorables” weaponized by Vladimir Putin’s hackers and Facebook’s sinister inner workings.
在伊拉克发生的事情同样适用于阿富汗：清除本·拉登足以成为奥巴马引以为傲的功绩，毫无疑问，这是一项成就，但这项成就并没有除掉问题的根源。	What is true for Iraq is also true for Afghanistan: Obama can pride himself on having eliminated Osama bin Laden, which was undoubtedly a success, but one that failed to address the root of the problem.
但你们的“强人”从长期看对你们的国家没有助益，很抱歉，特朗普对法治的蔑视助长了他们的经济管理不善和人权侵犯。	But your “strongmen” do not help your countries in the long run, and we are sorry that Trump’s disdain for the rule of law aids their economic mismanagement and human-rights abuses.
无论如何，TPP的批评者现在应该读一读那些长期以来他们一直说想一睹为快的具体条款，并重新思考对该协议的反对态度。	Regardless, the TPP’s critics should now read the specifics that they have so long said they wanted to see and reconsider their opposition to the deal.
这一地区看起来最成功的两个经济体 — — 白俄罗斯和阿塞拜疆 — — 与欧盟模式大相径庭。 它们的好运不是因为国内政策，阿塞拜疆是由于碳氢化合物，白俄罗斯是由于俄罗斯补助金。	Unlike the EU accession candidates of the 1990’s, the states of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus have little incentive or capacity to adopt the Union’s body of law, the acquis communautaire, and move up the value chain.
外国人目前持有美国国债总额的30%左右，而最新官方数据显示，2017年6月中国持有其中的1.15万亿美元 — — 占外国持股总额的19 ％ ， 略高于日本1.09万亿美元。	Foreigners currently own about 30% of all US Treasury securities, with the latest official data putting Chinese ownership at $1.15 trillion in June 2017 – fully 19% of total foreign holdings and slightly higher than Japan’s $1.09 trillion.
如果这一提案获得支持，影响可能非常深远；事实上，它可能导致禁止使用当前形式下的互联网，及其价值数千亿欧元的各种服务。	If that proposal gains traction, the implications could be far-reaching; indeed, it could prohibit the use of the Internet, with its myriad services valued at hundreds of billions of euros, in its current form.
今年9月，世界领导人将齐聚联合国，制定一套可持续发展目标（Sustainable Development Goals，SDG）解决这些威胁。	In September of this year, world leaders will gather at the United Nations to adopt a set of Sustainable Development Goals to address these rising threats.
在认识到即使是在人权名义下进行干预，干预者也可能像低劣的独裁者一样野蛮之后，整个世界经过这一锤炼已经向前迈进了，但是布莱尔好像止步不前了。	The world may have moved on, chastened by the realization that interveners, even when intervening in the name of human rights, can be as barbaric as tin pot dictators. But Blair, it seems, is not to be moved.
2011年约23%的地方卫生部门反映公共卫生应急计划数量锐减甚至消失。 还有15%反映2012年也有过类似的削减开支。	Some 23% of local health departments reported that public health preparedness programs were reduced or even eliminated in 2011, while a further 15% reported similar cuts in 2012.
服务导向型增长从很多方面来说都能解决“不稳定、不平衡、不协调并最终不可持续”的增长模式 — — 众所周知前总理温家宝批评过这一模式。	Services-led growth is, in many ways, the antidote to the “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and ultimately unsustainable” growth model that former Premier Wen Jiabao’s famously criticized in 2007.
但如今，关键性政治和经济机构正因为它们的运转环境反常的波动，以及管辖区内累积的信任缺失，而承受压力。	But, nowadays, key political and economic institutions are being pressured by unusual fluidity in their operating environments and the effects of a cumulative loss of trust on the part of their constituencies.
2013年3月奥巴马派出两名国务院高级官员威廉·J·布恩斯（William J. Burns）和杰克·沙利文（Jake Sullivan）开始在阿曼与伊朗人展开秘密对话。	In March 2013, Obama sent two senior State Department officials, William J. Burns and Jake Sullivan, to begin secret conversations with the Iranians in Oman.
一个更强大的个人社会安全网将使得政治家能容许企业和金融部门承担更大的压力，并帮助他们实现“下回真的跟以往不一样”的诺言。	A stronger safety net for individuals might allow politicians to accept more corporate or financial-sector distress, and help bolster their claim that next time really will be different.
欧洲央行的意图不那么明确，但对欧元区增长的态度显然已经更加乐观，认为所有与危机相关的就业损失都已经抵消。	The European Central Bank has been less clear about its intentions, but has sounded notably more optimistic about growth in the eurozone, noting that all the job losses associated with the crisis have now been offset.
2006年召开的科尔多瓦峰会上，查韦斯和卡斯特罗大有比拼谁的讲话最长最漫无边际之势，峰会上弥漫着高涨的情绪。	At the 2006 summit in Córdoba, when Chávez and Fidel Castro dueled over who could deliver the longest and most rambling address, spirits were running high.
在那里它们的生存条件糟糕得令人发指，尤其是在那些四处表演的流动马戏团，为了路上运输方便，他们用来装载动物的笼子必须设计得非常小。	Their living conditions are deplorable, especially in traveling circuses where cages have to be small so that they can go on the road.
毕竟，有关烟草行业的类似披露 — — 大型烟草企业知道些什么、什么时候知道的 — — 彻底改变了公共卫生状况。	After all, similar revelations about the tobacco industry – what the major cigarette companies knew and when they knew it – transformed the public-health landscape.
中国是一个高度自信的国家。 对于它而言，所谓“重返”只不过是意味着在缺席两百多年以后重新获得历史上的世界中心地位。	For China, a deeply self-confident country, to be “back” simply means regaining the country’s historical centrality in the world after an absence of more than two centuries.
首先，由于来自中国的进口产品成本低廉，美国消费者只需支付更少的价格就能买到从鞋子到电子产品在内的各类商品。	For starters, thanks to low-cost imports from China, US consumers pay less for a wide range of goods, from shoes to electronics.
如果在荣景时期没有采取足够的措施确保可持续的包容性增长，足够全面地应对极端金融压力就会变得更加困难。	Marshaling a sufficiently comprehensive response to extreme financial stress becomes even more difficult, if not enough was done during the good times to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth.
选民们通常也相信直觉 — — 虽然直觉并不总正确 — — 即传统左翼党派往往会多征税多开支，而右翼党派则恰恰相反。	Voters also have a gut instinct – usually, though not always, correct – that parties of the traditional left will tax and spend more, and that those of the right will do the opposite.
事实表明，令人印象深刻的许多社会科学研究认为，被决策者忽视或根本没有认识到的公共不满已经酝酿了好些时日。	As it happens, an impressive body of social-science research shows that the mounting public disaffection that policymakers ignored or simply missed had been in the making for some time.
在这样一个地缘政治纷争随处可见的年代，对淡水资源的过度争夺可能演变为对亚洲长期和平与稳定的严重威胁。	At a time of widespread geopolitical discord, competition over freshwater resources could emerge as a serious threat to long-term peace and stability in Asia.
或者，它们不会改变人手、破坏供应链，而是想办法将利润注册在低税地区 — — 常用手段是将总部功能搬出。	Or, rather than transferring personnel and disrupting supply chains, they may find a way to register profits in a lower-tax jurisdiction – typically by moving some head office functions there.
在整个非洲，歧视的经济成本正在增加，相应地，雇主、地主、医疗服务提供者、家哦哦与机构和其他群体也在排斥同性恋、双性恋和变性人士。	Across Africa, the economic costs of discrimination are increasing, in line with growing pressure on employers, landlords, health-care providers, educational institutions, and others to exclude LGBT people.
而站在最前沿的欧洲的未来和一部分身份也将受到威胁 — — 它所无力保护的人们正站在欧洲边境，要求进入。	And Europe, on the front line, risks its future and a part of its identity as the people it could not protect press at its borders, asking to be let in.
伦敦 — — 今年12月，各国领导人将汇聚巴黎召开联合国气候变化会议，届时他们将再次尝试制定一项温室气体减排的全球性协议。	LONDON – This December, world leaders will gather in Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, where they will attempt – yet again – to hammer out a global agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
自由贸易的支持者一直在为国际商业的发展歌功颂德，在他们看来这表明各国正在通过专业化分工来凸显各自的比较优势，也意味着整体效率的提高。	Proponents of free trade have always celebrated the growth of international commerce because they regard it as a sign that countries are capitalizing on their comparative advantages through specialization, which implies increased efficiency overall.
中东欧国家的官员应当关注英国内政部最近的一次讲话，核心意思是“我们解决这一复杂问题的所有目的就是为了减轻危害 。 ”	Officials in Central and Eastern Europe should pay heed to recent comments by the UK’s Home Office, which said that “harm reduction underpins every element of our approach to tackling this complex issue.”
另一方面，出生率高所导致的人口快速增长通过改变天平另一端的抚养比率，可能威胁到最贫困群体和国家的福祉。	On the other hand, rapid population growth as a result of higher birth rates can threaten the wellbeing of the poorest communities and countries, by altering the dependency ratio at the other end of the scale.
一股革命性的 — — 并且相当不“英国”的 — — 潮流已经形成，而英国首相梅本月在保守党会议上的《英国本土论 》 （ Little Englander）演讲表明，英国正在迈向“硬退欧 ” 。	An almost revolutionary – and very un-British – dynamic has taken hold, and, as British Prime Minister Theresa May indicated in her “Little Englander” speech at the Conservative Party conference this month, the UK is heading for a “hard Brexit.”
同样，为了担保2008年9月爱尔兰银行所负的债务，爱尔兰政府做出了一些任何负责任政府都不可能考虑的举动。	Similarly, in guaranteeing the debt of Irish banks in September 2008, the Irish government did something that no responsible government should have contemplated.
即使是那些知道一些美国力量的人也怀疑美国人会接受纳粹德国战败后为反对共产主义而捍卫欧洲的危险和代价。	And even those who did know something about American power, doubted that the Americans would accept the dangers and expense of defending Europe against Communism after Nazi Germany was defeated.
经济学家很久以前解决了关于商业资本支出背后驱动因素的争论：影响资金成本（利率，税收和法规）或未来需求的因素。	Economists long ago settled the debate over what drives business capital spending: factors affecting the cost of capital (interest rates, taxes, and regulations) or those that influence future demand.
在这个宣言中，我们承诺与政府合作，提高我们的研发投资，让需要的患者能够获得高质量的抗生素，以此遏制耐药性的发展。	Under that commitment, we promised to work together with governments to slow the development of resistance, by increasing our investments in R&D and making high-quality antibiotics available to patients who need them.
荒谬的是，世界上最成功的开放社会美国却并不真正了解开放社会的首要原则。 实际上，美国目前的领袖迫不及待地否定上述原则。	Paradoxically, the most successful open society in the world, the US, does not properly understand the first principles of an open society; indeed, its current leadership actively disavows them.
在1991年的第一次海湾战争期间，当伊拉克向以色列的平民目标发射了39枚飞毛腿导弹并且美国军队没能停止伊拉克的攻击时，以色列准备打击伊拉克目标，这可能导致美国－阿拉伯反对伊拉克同盟的分裂。	During the first Gulf War in 1991, when Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israeli civilian targets and US forces failed to stop the Iraqi attacks, Israel was set to strike Iraqi targets, which would have split the US-Arab anti-Iraq coalition.
这一协议并不完美，问题依然存在，因为新合同条款并不容易适用于旧债券，因此要花多年时间才能让所有债券存量都受这些条款约束。	The agreement is not perfect, and problems remain. Because new contractual provisions are not easily retrofitted into old bonds, it will take years before the clauses are included in the entire stock of debt.
分裂的伊拉克内战纷起，不仅会给中东地区、也会给美国的国际信用和权威、甚至泛大西洋关系带来灾难性的后果。	A divided Iraq at war with itself would be a disaster for the region, for America's international credibility and authority, and for transatlantic relations.
除了资金不足、依然薄弱和低效的卫生体系（特别是在农村地区 ） ， 非洲国家还面临无力承担更加昂贵的新疫苗的挑战。	Beyond inadequately financed health systems, which remain weak and inefficient, especially in rural areas, African countries face challenges in affording new, more expensive vaccines.
他们资助伪科学、收买研究人员和批评家、转嫁责任、宣传政府弱监管，甚至将其产品销售给儿童（托尼虎是早餐麦片行业的领军企业，就像烟草行业的骆驼一样 ） 。	They funded shoddy science, co-opted researchers and critics, shifted blame, advocated for weaker government oversight, and even marketed their products to children (as with Tony the Tiger, breakfast cereal’s equivalent of Big Tobacco’s Joe Camel).
目前，阿拉伯革命已经证明了一个假设 — — 大多数阿拉伯社会的结构决定了推翻世俗独裁免不了意味着开启了伊斯兰民主的大门。	So far, the Arab revolts have vindicated the assumption that, given the structure of most Arab societies, toppling secular autocracies inevitably means opening the door to Islamic democracies.
以色列的安全可以通过让伊朗构建与西方的合作性经济和地缘政治关系、反过来增加一拖再拖的以巴两国和解的机会而得到强化。	Israel’s security could be enhanced by bringing Iran into a cooperative economic and geopolitical relationship with the West, in turn enhancing the chances for a long-overdue two-state settlement with Palestine.
随着政治温和派被排挤出局，政策僵局恶化，总统的方案总是被国会中的共和党所阻挠，即使这些方案与共和党的理念相符。	As political moderates have been pushed out, policy gridlock has worsened, with presidential initiatives routinely blocked by congressional Republicans, even when such proposals were consistent with Republican ideas.
谢菲尔德大学人工智能与机器人科学教授诺尔·沙尔吉预测说，公务缠身的父母将会请机器人来照顾自己的小孩。	Noel Sharkey, professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield, has predicted that busy parents will start employing robots as babysitters.
这不仅反映出有关能源以及共同的安全担忧，而且反映出需要防止在中东出现滚滚欲来的危机。 这些危机即使把世界很多地方陷于武装冲突，也会把令其陷于动乱。	This reflects not only worries about energy and shared security concerns, but also the need to head off any looming crisis in the Middle East that could plunge large parts of the world into turmoil, if not armed conflict.
当世界寻找遏制机会型疫情（opportunistic epidemics）的新方法时，决不能忽视发展中国家的现成的科学知识。	As the world looks for new ways to curb opportunistic epidemics, it must not overlook the science that developing countries already possess.
欧洲法院（ECJ）的这一裁决给大约4,500家美国公司的数据收集、处理、传输和储存带来了法律不确定性。	The decision, by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), threw into legal uncertainty the collection, handling, transfer, and storage of user data by about 4,500 US companies.
无论如何，美国和欧洲领导人必须认识到，一切制裁都会给双方造成代价 — — 其中许多代价是不可预料的。	In any case, US and European leaders must recognize that all sanctions will have costs – many of them unexpected – for both sides.
特别是在赫尔穆特·科尔（Helmut Kohl）总理带领下的德国通常将货币一体化与政治联盟的目的联系在一起。	In particular, Germany under Chancellor Helmut Kohl often linked monetary integration with the objective of political union.
如果我们认识到事情的轻重缓急，就会从这次令人毛骨悚然的水灾中吸取教训，以环境上可持续的方式实现城市化。	If we get our priorities right, we will heed the lessons of this horror and create urban space only in environmentally sustainable ways.
在充满了不确定性的中东，更加可预料的伊朗 — — 像地区大国那样作为，而不再是一场野心突破了国际法允许范围的破坏性什叶派运动 — — 符合所有人的利益。	In a Middle East so full of uncertainty, a more predictable Iran – one that behaves like a regionally important state, not a destabilizing Shia movement whose ambitions exceed what international law permits – would be in everyone’s interest.
因此未来几个月将显示出这些公开表态是否有谈判的余地，而这也将为双方以及与国际社会（尤其是美国）的关系带来立竿见影的影响。	The coming months will show whether these public postures are negotiable, with obvious consequences for both parties and their relationship with the international community, especially the US.
从2018年开始德国将在未来七年内更新其作战飞机，试问它是会以欧洲团结的名义购买法国阵风战斗机，还是会从美国这个传统的安全保障者手中选择F-35？	In 2018, Germany will need to update its combat aircraft for the next seven years. Will it purchase French Rafale jets, in the name of European solidarity; or will it opt for American F-35s from its traditional security guarantor?
但他们所推崇的模式已经过时，因为日本现在直接面临其他许多亚洲和亚洲以外国家的竞争，这些国家的工作习惯和日本曾经的工作习惯非常相似。	But their model is obsolete, because Japan now competes directly with many other Asian and non-Asian countries, where work habits are of the type that used to prevail among the Japanese.
而且，将在某一货币市场持有多头的风险与汇率偏离同位水平联系在一起表明了思考中央银行如何影响市场来限制偏离同位。	Moreover, relating the riskiness of holding an open position in a currency market to the exchange rate’s divergence from parity levels suggests a novel way to think about how central banks can influence the market to limit departures from parity.
如果在不解决合同问题的情况下就让美元贬值，那么债务的美元价值就会自动上升以抵消下跌的汇率，导致大规模破产和公共债务水平飙升。	If the currency were devalued without addressing the contractual issue, the dollar value of debts would automatically increase to offset the weaker exchange rate, resulting in massive bankruptcies and huge increases in public debt.
由于安全利益日益向太平洋转移，美国现在只能依赖于越来越脆弱的陆上基地和作战半径300-500英里（482-805公里）的搭载战术飞机的航母舰队。	As US security interests shift to the Pacific, Americans now rely on increasingly vulnerable forward land bases and carrier fleets with tactical aircraft that have a combat radius of 300-500 miles (482-805 kilometers).
美国土木工程师协会（American Society of Civil Engineers，ASCE）给美国基础设施的评分是 D+，反映了维护拖延和投资不足两大问题。	The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gives a grade of D+ to infrastructure in the United States, reflecting both delayed maintenance and underinvestment.
而假设那些签订了京都议定书的国家都参照华克斯曼-马基气候变化法案来制定自己的法案 — — 这些法案不仅前景难料，且耗资巨大 — — 在本世纪末全球温度也将仅仅下降0.22摄氏度（0.35华氏度 ） 。	Even if every Kyoto-obligated country passed its own, duplicate Waxman-Markey bills – which is implausible and would incur significantly higher costs – the global reduction would amount to just 0.22°C (0.35°F) by the end of this century.
第二天，联邦法官驳回了他的任命，申诉和反诉纷至沓来，数百万人走上街头要求弹劾总统，没人确定谁掌控了局面。	The next day, a federal judge blocks his appointment, claims and counterclaims are filed before the courts, millions take to the streets demanding the president’s impeachment, and no one is quite certain who is in charge.
只有受过合适教育的劳动力大军和企业家阶层，才具备在新技术改变着工作、休闲、环境和社会的当下实现繁荣所需要的技能和动力 — — 并解决非洲最紧迫的挑战。	Only a properly educated workforce and entrepreneurial class will have the skills and drive to thrive as new technologies change the nature of work, leisure, the environment, and society – and to tackle our continent’s most pressing challenges.
这一关系主要建立在中国以来俄罗斯能源供给、双方都支持将“影响力范围”作为新的世界秩序的概念基础，以及双方在黑海的联合军演的基础上。	It is a relationship founded largely on Chinese dependence on Russian energy supplies, mutual support for “spheres of influence” as the conceptual foundation of an alternative world order, and joint naval exercises in the Black Sea.
在法国，极右的国民阵线在本月初差点夺得了一些地区的政权，其领导人，马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen ） ， 可能会在2017年总统大选中表现抢眼。	In France, the far-right National Front came close to winning power in several regions earlier this month, and its leader, Marine Le Pen, may do well in the 2017 presidential election.
伊朗的极端保守神权领袖似乎认为，通过在他们的核心地带煽动针对经济的愤怒情绪，就可以破坏温和派总统鲁哈尼。	Iran’s ultra-conservative theocrats appear to have thought that by stoking anger over the economy in their political heartlands, they would undermine the moderate President Hassan Rouhani.
在利马会议上，他指出所谓的“分离原则 ” — —即必须以不同手段保证货币和金融稳定，并将此任务各自分配给独立机构 — — 已经不再有意义了。	In Lima, he argued that the so-called “separation principle,” whereby monetary and financial stability are addressed differently and tasked to separate agencies, no longer makes sense.
在易受洪灾影响的国家，城市规划方案应当综合运用包括排水系统、堤坝和海墙等灰色基础设施，以及湿地和森林保护等绿色举措。	In flood-prone countries, city-planning schemes should blend gray infrastructure, such as drainage systems, dikes, and sea walls, with green measures, like conservation of wetlands and forests.
在废除《平价医疗法案》的企图遭遇失败后，国会共和党人转而强行通过一个复杂的税收方案来取悦自己那些金主们，同时却让很多选民大失所望。	After failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), congressional Republicans rammed through a complicated tax package that will please their wealthy donors, but disappoint many of their voters.
此中的利益冲突即便根据墨西哥的标准也太过明显，以致于第一夫人 — — 一位此前曾非常出名的电视演员 — — 迅速宣布她会��这栋豪宅卖掉。	The conflict of interest was so brazen, even by Mexican standards, that the first lady – a popular former telenovela actress – quickly announced that she would sell the mansion.
今年春天，当中国和朝鲜都在寻求利用日本统治的这段回忆塑造新国家身份和新战略地位之际，两国几乎同时爆发了反日游行。	This spring, anti-Japanese demonstrations broke out almost simultaneously in both China and Korea, with both countries seeking to place the memory of Japanese dominance in the service of building a new national identity and strategic position.
尽管沙龙缺席，前进党仍然在民意调查中领先。 最新的调查显示，该党将获得以色列议会120个席位中的44个，工党21个，而内塔尼亚胡领导的右翼残余的利库德党有14个席位。	Despite Sharon's absence, Kadima maintains its lead in public opinion polls – the most recent gave it 44 of the Knesset’s 120 seats, compared to 21 for Labor and 14 for the right-wing rump-Likud, under Binyamin Netanyahu.
而在外国投资者中，壳牌和英国石油天然气控股公司（TNK－BP）都被俄国天然气工业股份公司挤出了俄国国内的主要天然气田。	Among foreign investors, both Shell and TNK-BP are being pushed out by Gazprom in their main gas fields in Russia.
这种“待遇”远远超过了迈克·穆尔备受争议的《华氏9/11》和《大公司 》 （ The Corporation ） , 等纪录片里，对跨国公司在全球化中的角色严肃却又有些偏执的描绘。	This treatment goes far beyond documentaries like Michael Moore’s polemical Fahrenheit 9/11 or The Corporation , an earnest if somewhat paranoid portrayal of multinational companies’ role in globalization.
当2003年埃尔多安首次当选总理时，全球经济蓬勃发展巩固了他的地位，促使他大胆地开始对土耳其政体进行改革。	When Erdoğan first became prime minister in 2003, his position was bolstered by booming global growth, emboldening him to start transforming the Turkish polity.
但是，由大卫·卡梅隆所率领的保守党和得票数排名第三的自由民主党所组成的联盟（这也确保政府拥有了议会大多数）并不像某些人想象的那么新奇。	But the coalition negotiated by David Cameron’s Conservatives with the third-place Liberal Democrats (which should give the government a comfortable majority in Parliament) is not so novel as some people think.
一个明确、务实的战略将有利于巴勒斯坦赢得急切地期盼结束已有几十年之久的巴以冲突的地区和国际行动方的支持。	A clear, realistic strategy will be integral to Palestine’s efforts to win support from regional and international actors eager to end the decades-old conflict with Israel.
而米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）则把大萧条的责任推到美联储的头上，因为当时它允许货币供给下降。	Milton Friedman blamed the Depression on the Fed for allowing the money supply to fall.
但是这个分析颇有可疑之处，因为民意测验表明，那些许多投反对票的人反对希拉克并/或对居高不下的失业率心存不满。	But that diagnosis is suspect, because polls show that many who voted “non” were objecting to Chirac and/or to high rates of unemployment.
在2009年，她几乎是有意地将自己的竞选活动搞得无聊和平庸 ， （ 不情愿地）迎合了反对者对她所谓“老妈”的描述 — — 这是一种对家庭主妇的贬低式称呼。	In 2009, her campaign was deliberately boring and banal, embracing – however reluctantly – her opponents’ characterization of her as a “Mutti,” an unflattering stereotype of a mother managing the family home.
比如，2012年法国社会党在国民大会（National Assembly）中赢得近50%的席位，尽管它在第一轮选举中只获得了29%的选票。	For example, in 2012, the Socialists obtained nearly 50% of the seats in the National Assembly, despite having won only 29% of the vote in the first round.
由于企业（通常是有风险的）活动创造了财富 — — 从而创造就业机会 — — 其领导者理应获得更高的收入。	Because businesses’ (often risky) activities create wealth – and thus jobs – their leaders deserve higher incomes.
作为“法西斯的受害者 ” ， 我带着一张特殊的通行证，而其他人则展示着他们在最近军事行动中所获得的铁十字架。	I carried a special pass as a “victim of fascism,” but others showed their Iron Cross which they had got for late military action.
如果欧洲理事会选择韦博担任下一届欧盟委员会主席，那么欧洲议会中的社会民主党和自由派都有可能拒绝为来自继续收留奥尔班的政党的候选人投票。	If the European Council chooses Weber as the next European Commission president, both social democrats and liberals in the European Parliament could refuse to vote for a candidate from a party that keeps Orbán in its ranks.
布什难过地发现，在阿拉伯只要实行民主就会招致反西方的伊斯兰份子，无论他们是埃及的穆斯林兄弟会还是伊拉克的什叶派党派或者是巴勒斯坦的哈马斯。	Bush discovered to his dismay that any exercise in Arab democracy is bound to usher in anti-Western Islamists, be it the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Shia parties in Iraq, or Hamas in Palestine.
即使得到了，它们也将会需要援助，不仅仅是帮助开采其资源，而且也是提高玻利维亚人民的健康和教育水平来确保长期的经济增长和社会福利。	Even if they do, they will need assistance, not only to extract their resources, but also to improve the health and education of all Bolivians – to ensure long-term economic growth and social welfare.
而全球教育合作组织（Global Partnership for Education ） 、 莫扎王妃（Sheikha Mozah）的教育儿童基金会（Educate a Child）以及全球教育商业联盟（Global Business Coalition for Education）等组织也在紧急状态期间提供了帮助。	And organizations like the Global Partnership for Education, Sheikha Mozah’s Educate a Child foundation, and the Global Business Coalition for Education also contribute in times of emergency.
即便在最有利的情况下，整个建设进程依然需时较长；而建设工期在体制动员能力薄弱的发展中国家中更是旷日持久，导致大量的额外费用。	That process is long in the best of times; in developing countries with weak institutional capabilities, it is often drawn out substantially, creating massive additional costs.
这次航行到现在仍是史上极地考察最震撼的悲剧之一，也将长达四个世纪西北通道（跨越北冰洋实现欧亚直航）失败的探索努力推向了高潮。	The voyage was the culmination of four centuries of failed attempts to navigate the Northwest Passage – a direct route from Europe to Asia across the Arctic Ocean – and remains one of the greatest tragedies in the history of polar exploration.
20世纪90年代初的苏联解体不是西方造成的，而是由一系列脱离造成的，而脱离是因为民主主义者和少数族裔看到了党国已经变弱，于是抓住机会脱离苏联。	The collapse of the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1990’s was caused not by the West, but by a wave of secession, as nationalities and minorities, seeing the party-state weakened, seized the opportunity to break free.
我们希望国际社会对苏丹的持续大范围关注能为苏丹人民提供必要的支持，让他们可以实现上述目标，包括再有必要的情况下建立两个能独立运作的国家。	It is to be hoped that the sustained and enormous international focus on Sudan has as its objective providing the necessary support to the Sudanese people to help them achieve this goal, including building two viable states, as may be necessary.
可悲的是，在目前看来，自从约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯解释了由于市场需求的不足，经济是如何受制于失业率的理论之后，宏观经济学家们并没有什么新的贡献。	Sadly, in view of today’s needs, macroeconomists have made little progress on policy since John Maynard Keynes explained how economies could get stuck in unemployment due to deficient aggregate demand.
政府同意接受国际贸易组织的裁决，因为总体上看它们从国际贸易秩序中获益非浅，即便世贸组织可能在某个特定的裁决中要求主权国家修改其做出的决定也不例外。	Governments agree to accept the rulings of the World Trade Organization because on balance they benefit from an international trading order even if a particular decision requires that they alter a practice that is their sovereign right to carry out.
在埃及，西方应该与所有三大领先政治实力合作，即军队、穆兄会和城市年轻人，因为从短期看不可能会出现单一观点的解决方案。	In Egypt, the West should work with all three leading political forces – the military, the Brotherhood, and the urban young – because no short-term solution will come in the form of one option.
这点在乌克兰显得尤为突出，即便最近实现了停火，但俄罗斯和西方依然未能找到一个最终缓解紧张局势的出路。	This is particularly true in Ukraine, where, despite the current ceasefire, Russia and the West have yet to find a way to ease tensions definitively.
特朗普和约翰逊违反道德准则不在于他们背叛了他们的妻子，而在于他们肆无忌惮地向本应该代表的民众撒谎而破坏了这些条件。	The moral case against Trump and Johnson is not that they have been unfaithful to their wives, but rather that they subvert these conditions by lying relentlessly to the people they are supposed to represent.
但正如一些国家所表明的那样，市场经济可以采取某些可以缓和过度资本主义和全球化的形式，为大多数公民提供更可持续的增长和更高的生活水平。	But, as some countries have shown, a market economy can take forms that temper the excesses of both capitalism and globalization, and deliver more sustainable growth and higher standards of living for most citizens.
大范围的结构性经济调整及改革深化需要稳健的货币政策和稳定及社会可承受的通胀预期，但在表现良好的实体经济对信贷有持续增长的实际需要的情况下，过度收紧货币政策会影响经济调整过程的顺利展开。	While broader structural economic change requires tighter monetary policy and lower inflation, excessively tight monetary policy, given continued high credit demand, could disrupt the adjustment process.
资助也门代理战争、支持黎巴嫩政党和恐怖组织、以及寻求主宰叙利亚和伊拉克让伊朗每年都要付出几十亿美元。	Funding a proxy war in Yemen, propping up a political party and terrorist group in Lebanon, and seeking to dominate Syria and Iraq cost billions of dollars annually.
更糟糕的是，除了给你带来短暂快感之外，果糖不能为任何一个新陈代谢过程所用；它是一种退化的营养物，是植物和动物进化分歧的遗留产物。	Worse yet, other than the ephemeral pleasure that it provides, there is not a single biochemical process that requires dietary fructose; it is a vestigial nutrient, left over from the evolutionary differentiation between plants and animals.
归根结底，没有什么能够比传统科研机构以外的科学家更有利于创���，因为他们会为了拯救自己的一家老小而找到问题的解决办法。	After all, nothing is better for innovation than a scientist working outside conventional institutions, solving a problem that will save his or her family.
20世纪90年代的全球气温已经比工业化之前升高了0.5摄氏度，从里约地球首脑会议召开后又升高了0.3摄氏度。	Global temperatures had already risen by 0.5 ºC above preindustrial levels by the early 1990’s, and another 0.3ºC have been added to that since the Rio Earth Summit.
这就是为什么紧缩主义者如此反对它，也是为什么即使是那些接受财政刺激理论的人也会坚持通过单独的货币政策来实施。	That is why the austerians are so against it, and why even those who accept the theoretical case for a stimulus insist on implementing it through monetary policy alone.
欧洲应该努力让俄罗斯加入到欧洲能源共同纲领中来，后者要求俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司允许它的生产竞争者进入俄罗斯的天然气管道，并且所有争端都应该通过国际仲裁来解决。	Europe can help by insisting that Russia participate in the European Energy Charter, which calls for Gazprom to grant its production competitors access to Russian pipelines, and for all disputes to be settled by international arbitration.
任何有兴趣参加的人都可以在世界各地针对会上的言论发表自己的问题和评论，但必须首先在 www.securityjam.org 上注册。	Anyone interested in taking part can log on from anywhere in the world to pose questions or comment on what is being said, but they need first to sign up at www.securityjam.org .
现在，美国的经常项目赤字已达到国内生产总值的7 % 。 看到这种情况，像我这样的传统宏观经济学家都清楚，在巨额赤字后，会不可避免地出现大幅度货币贬值。	Conventional macroeconomists like me look at America’s current-account deficit, now running at 7% of GDP, and know that such vast deficits are inevitably followed by large currency depreciations.
事实上，据伦敦风险投资公司Atomico的一份新报告，如今欧洲初创企业正在领先人工智能领域、形成新的技术枢纽，并吸引着来自传统行业的投资。	In fact, according to a new report by the London venture capital firm Atomico, European startups are now taking the lead in artificial intelligence, building new tech hubs, and drawing investment from traditional industrial stalwarts.
也有其他人认为，虽然这个研究小组制造出了一个人造基因组，但他们也只是将其放进了来自另外一个细菌的细胞之中，代替了原有细胞的DNA。	Others have pointed out that, although the team produced a synthetic genome, they put it into a cell from another bacterium, replacing that cell’s DNA.
但中国人早已证明完全没有兴趣站队，因为随着西方企业日益厌恶与俄罗斯做生意，中国将能够买到更多的俄罗斯能源出口、获得更多的新机会，从中渔利。	But the Chinese have proved completely unwilling to pick one camp or the other, as they stand to benefit from more purchases of Russian energy exports and new opportunities as Western firms become more squeamish about doing business in Russia.
如果人道对待动物协会无权按照他们认为最有力的方式抗议我们对于动物的虐待，仅仅是因为这样做可能会冒犯某些人，那么对于宗教的批评也可以出于同样的原因被禁止。	If PETA is not allowed to state its case against our abuse of animals in the way that they judge best, because doing so might offend some people, then criticism of religion could also be prohibited on the same grounds.
当女性能够获得从手机银行到远程医疗等全方位的数字服务，她们往往会变得更富有、更健康，而且也受过更良好的教育。	When women have access to the full range of digital services – from mobile banking to telemedicine – they are generally wealthier, healthier, and better educated.
为人所熟知的后果是深化了主要全球储备货币 — — 美元和号称世界“最安全”金融资产的美国国债的不确定性。	The better-known consequence has been deepening uncertainty about the US dollar, the main global reserve currency, and US Treasury securities, supposedly the world’s “safest” financial asset.
如果我们想看到真正的全球FDI流动，特别是流向最需要的国家，我们就必须开始纠正投资保护机制的制度性缺陷。	If we are to see truly global FDI flows, particularly to those countries that need them the most, we must begin to address the institutional deficiencies of the investment-protection regime.
此外，地处内陆以水��出口为支柱产业的老挝为了向以中国为首的国家出口水电刚刚通知邻国其决定修筑发电量为912兆瓦的北宾大坝，这也是第三个具有争议的项目。	Meanwhile, landlocked Laos – aiming to export hydropower, especially to China, the mainstay of its economy – has just notified its neighbors of its decision to move ahead with a third controversial project, the 912-megawatt Pak Beng dam.
据此，越多来自纽约或旧金山的自由派，或者真的有来自休斯顿的自由派，鼓吹控制向公民出售枪支，支持拥有殖民武器的权利的人就越难反驳。	It follows, then, that the more liberals from New York or San Francisco, or indeed Houston, agitate for ways to control the sale of guns to civilians, the harder proponents of the right to own lethal weapons will fight back.
从某方面来看，的确是这样，而且在独裁政体的铁腕下，加上他们对伪科学的恶劣官方政策的鼓吹，特别是有关“种族卫生主义”的政策，基因选择可能与优生主义早期的邪恶派别相似。	So it is, in a way, and in the hands of authoritarian regimes, genetic selection could resemble the evils of earlier forms of eugenics, with their advocacy of odious, pseudoscientific official policies, particularly concerning “racial hygiene.”
中国有十三亿人口，不乏具有领导潜力的人才。 我相信越来越多这样的人才位于中共官僚之外而立足于各个非政府组织、新兴企业、慈善事业甚至传教士工作之中。	With a population of 1.3 billion, China has no lack of people with leadership potential, and I believe that more and more of this talent is situated outside the Party bureaucracy in NGOs, startup enterprises, philanthropy, and even missionary work.
投资银行年轻才俊将面临千载难逢的良机，设计出更具参与性的风险资本形式 — — 比如新出现的大众集资网站 — — 以刺激创新性小企业的成长。	Young investment bankers, for their part, have a great opportunity to devise more participatory forms of venture capital – embodied in the new crowd-funding Web sites – to spur the growth of innovative new small businesses.
而在将巴基斯坦从去军事化转型到一个可以对掌权人物实施有效制衡的承诺方面，自信程度日渐增加的巴基斯坦最高法院审理了三大案件。	Three cases before the country’s increasingly assertive Supreme Court promise to take Pakistan from the phase of demilitarization to a system in which meaningful checks can be exercised on those who wield power.
欧盟的主要设计者之一是法国外交官兼经济学家让·莫内，二战期间，他作为欧洲盟军谈判代表在华盛顿呆了很长时间。	One of the EU’s main architects, Jean Monnet, a French diplomat and economist, spent much of World War II in Washington, DC, as a negotiator for the European allies.
类似地，仇恨言论、恐怖主义诉求和种族和性骚扰在互联网上找到了“主场”的感觉，有可能导致真实世界中的暴力。	Likewise, the hate speech, terrorist appeals, and racial and sexual harassment that have found a home on the Internet can lead to real-world violence.
然而，与由苛捐杂税、官员腐败和肆意征地引发的农民抗议活动联系起来考量，以上所为也不过是权宜之计。 共产党的领导人们发现自己正面临着一种令他们极为不安的情况。	Its power to intimidate and punish may trump all its other moves to stay ahead of the discontent.
换句话说，国际货币基金组织、 经合组织、 世界银行，英国政府以及英格兰银行等机构撰写了汗牛充栋的报告，异口同声地警告退盟将引发重大损失，最终却遭到了人们的漠视。	In other words, all the voluminous reports – by the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the World Bank, and the British government and the Bank of England – unanimously warning of significant losses from Brexit have been disregarded.
事实上，都铎的战略可能会成功。 因为在总统扬·伊利埃斯库和总理阿德里安·讷斯塔塞领导下的社会民主党为了在11月的大选中获得多数票可能不会拒绝这样的联盟。	In fact, Tudor's strategy may work, because the ex-communist PDSR, led by President Ion Iliescu and Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, will probably not oppose such an alliance if it is necessary to give them a majority after November's general election.
尽管现在就预计所有结果为时过早，部分良性结果已经显现出来，部分则显得有些棘手，另外一些的影响则会随时间自然消逝。	Though it is too soon to predict all the effects, some good consequences are already evident, as are some that are troublesome and others whose impact will play out over time.
即使国会决定在这方面不做出改变，特朗普的反伊朗论调和其他国会的共和党计划也制约着JCPOA，使其岌岌可危。	Even if Congress decides to do nothing on this front, Trump’s anti-Iran rhetoric and other Republican initiatives in Congress have strained the JCPOA and left it vulnerable.
用诗人马拉美（Stéphane Mallarmé）的话说，我们应该铭记，当我们自娱自乐，陶醉于丑闻时，我们“打着抑郁的哈欠走向黑暗深渊 。 ”	Ought we not bear in mind, with the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, that when we amuse ourselves thus and become so inebriated with scandal, we “yawn gloomily toward a dark demise.”
如果中国不得不动用武力支持其在（比如）南海或台湾海峡的激进策略，那么解放军决不能由腐化不忠的将军领导。	Should China have to back its aggressive tactics in, say, the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait with force, its military must not be led by venal and perfidious generals.
由于葡萄牙，希腊和西班牙在经济增长方面的不利前景和脆弱的公共财政，评级机构已经下调了这三个国家的等级。	Rating agencies have downgraded Portugal, Greece, and Spain, owing to their poor prospects for economic growth and weak public finances.
相反，中国充满活力，目光开放 — — 这给了欧盟很好的理由去充当强力领导者，与中国在关键问题（如欧亚可持续基础设施）上进行建设性合作。	China, by contrast, is dynamic and outward-looking – providing good reason for the EU to assume vigorous leadership and engage in constructive partnerships with China on key initiatives (such as sustainable infrastructure across Eurasia).
要充分理解这类“道德暴力”的恶劣性，想象彼此相爱、支持和肯定的朋友，以及这些行为对于他们的个体和集体存在有多重要。	To grasp fully the depravity of this type of “moral violence,” think of friends who love, approve, and affirm one another, and how important those actions are to their individual and collective existence.
在新兴市场，尤其是在亚洲，快速经济扩张已经带来了威胁生存的雾霾，并导致基础设施扩张速度跟不上的城市陷入严重的交通拥堵。	In emerging markets, especially in Asia, rapid economic expansion has brought life-threatening smog and constant gridlock to cities unable to expand their infrastructure fast enough.
最新的奎利安姆基金会（Quilliam Foundation）报告认为，达伊莎利用青年的渴望作为价值的一部分；该组织的乌托邦诉求是对新圣战斗士吸引力最大的东西。	As a recent Quilliam Foundation report concludes, Daesh plays on the youthful desire to be part of something worthwhile; it is the organization’s utopian appeal that is most alluring to new recruits.
抗耐药性评估建议、G-7国家承认的第三个当务之急是改进监控耐药性传染病的传播，特别是在数据缺失严重的发展中国家。	A third imperative, recommended by the Review and recognized by the G-7, is improved surveillance of the spread of drug-resistant infections, particularly in developing countries, where such data is most sparse.
因此，尽管面临英国脱欧的未知情况，他们仍在继续投资于未来导向的领域，如云计算、人工智能和数据分析等。	So, despite the Brexit unknowns, they are continuing to invest in future-oriented areas like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data analytics.
而在欧盟核心区，这类党派往往是右派：德国的另一道路党（Alternative ） ， 法国的国民阵线，以及奥地利，荷兰，丹麦，芬兰，瑞典和其他国家的类似极右政党。	In the EU core, such parties tend to be on the right: Alternative for Germany, France’s National Front, and similar far-right parties in Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and elsewhere.
十年来，我都在提议，未来的国际货币基金组织应该被看作是一个区域储备基金网络的顶点 — — 也就是说，一个在设计上和欧洲中央银行或者美国联邦储备系统相近的体系。	For a decade, I have proposed that the IMF of the future should be seen as the apex of a network of regional reserve funds – that is, a system closer in design to the European Central Bank or the United States Federal Reserve system.
有证据表明转型时期的压力是导致死亡的罪魁祸首，甚至超过了后共产主义时代俄国最为可怕的杀手：酒精、凶杀和艾滋病。	There is growing evidence that the stress of transition is the leading cause of death, even above big killers in postcommunist Russia such as alcohol, murder, and AIDS.
但是，美国开国元勋们显然希望限制总统能够做什么，即使他有一个支持他的国会和倾向性 有利于他的最高法院。	Still, America’s founders obviously wanted to limit what any president could do, even with a supportive Congress and a favorably inclined Supreme Court.
僵尸银行应该予以重组，过度的债务（不管是公是私）应该予以减记，并增加投资、实施改革以提高生产率（从而提高工资 ） 。	Zombie banks should be restructured, excessive debts (both private and public) written down, and increased investment combined with reforms to boost productivity (and thus wages).
发自伦敦 — — 英国新联合政府的预算紧缩计划无疑占据了各大媒体的头条，但大卫·卡梅隆内阁同时也与前任工党政府在另一个关键领域彻底决裂 — — 那就是人权。	LONDON – The budget-cutting austerity program of Britain’s new coalition government has been claiming all the headlines, but David Cameron’s cabinet is breaking with its Labour predecessor in another key area as well: human rights.
我猜将来传统主义者和公有社会论者会形成政治光谱中预防性的那一极，而自由论者和专家政治论者则化身成为主动性的另一极。	In the future, I suggest, the traditionalists and the communitarians will form the precautionary pole of the political spectrum, while the libertarians and technocrats will form the proactionary pole.
尽管不同的估算结果相差很大，但2014年的一份联合国报告表明，光是改善基础设施，就需要高达7万亿美元的总投资。	Although estimates vary widely, one UN report from 2014 suggests that total investment of as much as $7 trillion will be required for infrastructure improvements alone.
根据商定的协议，所有参与国都可以自由确定自己的减排目标和实现这些目标的政策，还可以按照自认为适当的方式来进行修正。	Under the agreed deal, all participating countries are free to determine their own emissions-reduction targets and the policies for achieving them, and they may make revisions as they see fit.
但如今美国总统特朗普最新推出的进口关税可能将世界拖入一场全面贸易战，令过去取得的大部分进展荡然无存。	But now, US President Donald Trump’s latest dose of import tariffs could push the world into a full-blown trade war, undoing much of that progress.
他们最大的诉求 — — 稳定的工作，更迅速的增长，低食品价格 — — 并不是协调一致的，甚至有些人还要求实施一些错误的政策。	Their biggest demands – secure jobs, faster growth, low food prices – are not necessarily compatible, and they may require policies that inflict pain.
但我面临的真正问题不是愚昧，也不是法律不完善，而是在俄国这样不健全的体系中，多数时候要靠我的个人威望，还需要大众媒体的鼎立支援。	But the real problem for my office is neither ignorance nor legal infirmity, it is that in an under-developed legal system such as Russia's, my authority is mostly personal, and requires help from the mass media.
接下来就是武装分子对救援人员长达数小时的折磨，羞辱，用点燃的手榴弹进行的威胁，对着我们一个同事的脚的开枪射击，以及对国际救援委员会所在地的抢劫和掠夺。	What followed were many hours of harassment, humiliation, threats with live hand grenades, shots fired at the feet of one of our colleagues, and looting and ransacking of the IRC premises.
两国政府的运作方式非常相似：政党老板、富豪和分赃的腐败份子，宣扬“传统价值观 ” （ 无论是东正教还是儒学） 和沙文主义。	The way both governments operate is quite similar: party bosses, tycoons, and corrupt bureaucrats divide the spoils, while promoting chauvinism and “traditional values” – whether those of the Orthodox Church or Confucianism.
对于像智利这样的国家，大型水电项目总是引起颇多政治争议，太阳能电和风电增长又太慢，来自美国的天然气进口将成为有力的助推器。	For a country like Chile, where large hydroelectric projects have been politically controversial, and where solar and wind power have been too slow in coming, gas imports from the US would be a tremendous boon.
VIX上一次跌到今天这么低的水平实在2006年到2007年初期间，当时，你也可以找到一长串潜在风险。	The last time the VIX was as low as it is today, in 2006 and early 2007, one could also draw up a lengthy list of potential crises.
出于这些原因，我很高兴自己的课程能成为可持续发展解决方案网（SDSN）普通教育计划的一部分，该计划由联合国秘书长潘基文倡议，我荣幸地担任主管。	For these reasons, I am also pleased that my course will be part of a more general education program of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, an initiative under the auspices of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that I am honored to direct.
提高退休年龄来巩固法定退休金制度常常被抨击为不公平，因为体力劳动者，如护士和力工，无法工作到70岁。	Raising the retirement age to shore up a statutory pension scheme is often denounced as unfair, because people with physically demanding jobs, such as nurses and manual laborers, cannot be expected to work until they are 70.
"所以其他国家必须学会加入到这场游戏当中来。 支持""多边主义""和国际法则也许不仅仅是道义上正确的事情，它还是美国的盟国及美国自己的利益所在。"	Standing up for multilateralism and international rule of law may not only be the morally right thing to do; it is also in the interests of America's allies and, ultimately, America itself.
几个月来，莫斯科和联邦政府一直对高速公路的反对者视若无睹，因此梅德韦杰夫的决策向人们发出信号： 不允许轻视民众的要求。	For many months, Moscow and federal authorities ignored the highway’s opponents, so Medvedev’s decision was a signal: contempt for the people is inadmissible.
在这样的环境中，洞晓一切的冷静声音，比如央行的央行 — — 国际清算银行（Bank for International Settlements）的声音也应该被大众所听到。	In this environment, sober, informed voices, like that of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank of central banks, should also be given a fair hearing.
关于成年人的主观福祉，世界各地的最新研究很多。 但我尚未见到可与之相比的直接向儿童询问其对福祉的看法的研究 — — 事实上，这是一个相当机智的问题。	There have been many recent studies of the subjective well-being of adults around the world. But I know of no comparable research in which children were asked directly about their sense of well-being – a very smart question indeed.
看看他的基金会应对疟疾的方法：在低技术层面上专注于使用蚊帐，一种有一定效果的干预方式；在高技术层面上，则顷力研发疫苗，费时数十载却无斩获。	Consider his foundation’s approach to malaria, which focuses on bed nets, a low-tech, only modestly effective intervention, and on the development of a vaccine, a high-tech solution that has eluded intensive efforts for decades.
尽管伊斯兰教徒不太可能卷入后阿拉法特时代的权力斗争，但如果新领袖在他们看来犯了方向性的错误，那他们也绝不会坐视不管。	Although the Islamists are unlikely to interfere in the post-Arafat power struggle, they will not sit idly by if the new leadership moves in what they consider the wrong direction.
归根结底，为促进区域和平，最佳的办法是美国、中国与亚洲其他国家，尤其是印度，印尼，日本和韩国，共同承担维护区域秩序的责任。	Ultimately, the best way for peace to prevail in the region is for the US and China to share responsibility for a regional order with Asia’s other powers, particularly India, Indonesia, Japan, and South Korea.
虽然这些不满不仅仅是经济上的，但民粹主义的地理分布确实与欧盟的经济不景气状况相契合：太多的欧洲人已经迷茫了太久。	While those grievances are not exclusively economic, the geography of populism does fit that of the EU’s economic malaise: too many Europeans have been losing out for too long.
美国决心为日本提供防卫的真正保证是美国军队以及军事基地的存在，以及它们在旨在保护美国和日本公民的种种行动，比如弹道导弹防御系统上的合作。	The real guarantee of American resolve to defend Japan is the presence of US troops and bases, and cooperation on issues – such as ballistic missile defense – aimed at protecting both Americans and Japanese.
这就是我们可能称之为“非相关性”的辩护：原来金融理论家们可以不负责任，是因为没有人在现实世界里关注他们！	This amounts to what we might call an “irrelevance” defense: Finance theorists cannot be held responsible, since no one in the real world pays attention to them!
在这方面，以及为了纪念东盟成立50周年，我们将今年定为“韩国-东盟文化交流年 ” ， 积极地推动不同文化之间和人际之间的交流。	To this end, and in commemoration of ASEAN’s 50th anniversary, we have designated this year as “Korea-ASEAN Cultural Exchange Year,” and actively promoted various cultural and people-to-people exchanges.
最引人瞩目的也许要数最近在北京成立的亚洲基础设施投资银行（亚投行 ） 。 亚投行将作为中国对外投资的主要载体之一。	Perhaps most notable, it recently led the establishment of the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which will serve largely as a vehicle for Chinese foreign investment.
让问题进一步复杂化的是，一些国会共和党 — — 如肯塔基州参议员保罗·兰德（Paul Rand）和北卡罗来纳州众议员马克·米道斯（Mark Meadows ） — —似乎并不反对美国政府以某种形式的局部违约或其他赖账方式。	Complicating the issue further, some congressional Republicans – such as Senator Paul Rand of Kentucky and Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina – seem not to oppose some form of partial default or other reneging on debt by the US government.
他们对低收入消费者而言是一个佳音，在某种程度上弥补了过去二十年中他们中的许多人所忍受的缓慢工资增长。	They are an enormous boon to low-income consumers, partly compensating for the tepid wage growth that many of them have suffered during the past two decades.
就在一年前的10月16日，调查贪污事件的马耳他记者达芙妮·卡鲁阿娜·加利西亚（Daphne Caruana Galizia）提交了一份似乎与她的死亡有关的报道，但几分钟后就在楼下被一枚汽车炸弹炸死。	October 16 marked one year since Daphne Caruana Galizia, a Maltese journalist investigating corruption, was killed by a car bomb just minutes after filing a story that seemed to forecast her death.
我们可以想象区区几位技师取代了整车队的出租车和卡车司机，少数人类技师承担着机器人劳工大军的维修任务，又或者一名数据分析师利用软件取代银行所有的定量研究员职务。	Imagine a handful of technicians replacing a fleet of taxi drivers and truckers, a small cadre of human mechanics maintaining a full robot workforce, or a single data analyst and his software replacing a bank of quantitative researchers.
日本银行将其资产负债表规模扩大至GDP的近60 % — —比美联储还要高一倍 — — 但它发现，其结束通缩的努力正在日益失效。	After expanding its balance sheet to nearly 60% of GDP – double the size of the Fed’s – the BOJ is finding that its campaign to end deflation is increasingly ineffective.
在一致性等于质量的假设下，大小和颜色异常的（比如）西红柿被认为是劣等的（除非有人称它们是“传家宝”西红柿，强调它们的独特性 ） 。	Under the assumption that consistency equals quality, variation in the size or color of, say, tomatoes has come to be considered bad (unless one calls them “heirloom” tomatoes and emphasizes their uniqueness).
九十年代和二十一世纪之初亚洲和拉美金融危机发生之际，它们不仅从国际货币基金组织、而且也从几个代表了多样背景和经验的著名人士组成的专家小组那里听取建议。	When Asia and Latin America had their financial meltdowns in the 1990’s and early 2000’s, they took advice not only from the IMF, but also from a number of small panels composed of eminent people representing diverse backgrounds and experiences.
这些措施致力于通过增加欧安组织成员国之间互信以及在军事部署和其他行动方面增加透明度的方式来减少冲突的风险。	Such measures aim to reduce the risk of conflict by increasing trust among participating OSCE states, and by contributing to greater transparency in the field of military planning and other activities.
在法国 ， “ 世俗化 ” （ laïcité）一词 — — 在英语中，它被错误地译为“secularism ” — —是宗教的同义词，法兰西共和国的宗教。	In France, laïcité, wrongly translated in English as “secularism,” is the equivalent of a religion – the religion of the Republic.
打破欧盟委员会和欧盟理事会的官僚主义管理并将国内研究资金向欧盟领域内的竞争开放，将使研究费用得到更有效的利用。	Research spending should be made more effective by scrapping bureaucratic management by the Commission and Council and opening all national research funds to EU-wide competition.
全球金融市场并未带来纪律，而是让负债变得更加容易，从而减弱了挥霍政府的预算约束，也导致银行资产负债表过度膨胀。	Rather than exerting discipline, global financial markets have increased the availability of debt, thereby weakening profligate governments' budget constraints and over-extended banks' balance sheets.
这有助于防止政府对公私合作项目的担保给预算带来大于或等于GDP的1%的成本，哥伦比亚、印度尼西亚和葡萄牙都超过了这一标准。	This will help to prevent government guarantees for public-private partnerships from imposing budgetary costs equivalent to one or more points of GDP, as has happened in Colombia, Indonesia, and Portugal.
对欧盟而言，失去像英国这样在军事和经济上都很重要的国家无疑是一种打击；但失去法国这样的创始成员国或将酿成悲剧性的后果。	For the EU to lose a country as militarily and economically important as the UK is bad enough; but to lose a founding EU member state, such as France, would be tragic.
不仅如此，特朗普的国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林将军因为与俄国人的诡异交易被迫下台，而他在白宫的内部圈子成员正在激烈博弈。	Moreover, Trump’s national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, had to step down because of dodgy dealings with the Russians, and members of his inner circle at the White House are fighting like cats and dogs.
就在欧洲央行于去年八月开始购买意大利债券的时候，时任意大利总理的贝卢斯科尼却突然放弃了推行税收改革的承诺。	Soon after the ECB began buying Italian bonds last August, then-Prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s government backtracked on its commitments to tax reform.
“进口食品和西式食物已经在我们国家泛滥太久了 ” ， 尤妮斯说 ， “ 现在是我们发起反击，种植自己的食物的时候了 。 ”	“For too long our country has been flooded with imported food and Westernized foods,” Wangari says. “This is our time to fight back – and grow our own.”
大部分媒体报道关注逃离武装冲突的难民（比如叙利亚 ） ， 或寻求比国内更好的经济机会的移民（比如尼日利亚或波兰 ） 。	Most media coverage focuses on refugees fleeing armed conflict (think Syria) or migrants seeking better economic opportunities than they have at home (think Nigeria or Pakistan).
这种失权（disempowerment）感有可能让发展中世界的青年膨胀（youth bulge，即青年占人口多数的现象）演变为青年诅咒 — — 并带来严重的潜在后果。	This sense of disempowerment is threatening to turn the developing world’s youth bulge into a youth curse – with serious potential consequences.
作为2012年飓风季中心气压最低的飓风，桑迪可能已经造成了高达200亿美元的损失，也因此成为史上破坏力最强的飓风之一。	With the lowest central pressure of the 2012 hurricane season, Sandy may have caused up to $20 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest superstorms in history.
他所披露的行为引发了公众愤怒和德国等亲密盟友的强烈指责，颠覆了现实生活中互联网和电信网络多么自由安全的美好假设。	His disclosures have elicited public outrage and sharp rebukes from close US allies like Germany, upending rosy assumptions about how free and secure the Internet and telecommunications networks really are.
许多人都回想起以色列前总理伊扎克·沙米尔所提出的所谓首要战略 ： “ 我会把自治谈判拖上10年，好让西岸地区的以色列人口数量达到50万”	Many recall the preferred strategy of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir: “I would have conducted negotiations on autonomy for ten years, and in the meantime we would have reached a half-million people in the West Bank.”
监督高科技企业的治理情况所需要的技巧，与管理对外合资企业截然不同，目前后者才是国有企业和主权财富基金更喜欢的形式。	Overseeing the governance of high-tech firms requires a fundamentally different skill set than managing joint ventures with foreign partners, a craft that SOEs and SWFs have recently perfected.
立法程序很慢，而且往往枝节丛生，而由于联盟的变化、意料之外的机会和隐藏得很深的陷阱，国际外交形式瞬息万变。	Legislative processes are slow and often tortuous, while international diplomacy can change overnight, owing to shifting coalitions, unexpected opportunities, and well-hidden traps.
假以时日，这些打印店将取代售卖各种各样玩意的各种各样的店铺，在这些店铺中，有的玩意要几个月时间才有人问津。	Over time, these print shops will replace thousands of stores carrying millions of items, some of which sit around for months waiting to be bought.
如今，对“精英”的信心崩塌 — — 不管是对政治领袖还是，是的，对公司董事 — — 在这样的情况下，积极使用这一权力保护年轻人将给重塑分裂社会内部的信任带来额外的好处。	At a time of collapsing confidence in “elites” – from political leaders to, yes, board members – actively using this power to protect young people would have the added benefit of fostering trust within divided societies.
在美国，欺诈性开支在公共部门卫生支出中的占比高达10 % ， 面临医疗服务经济障碍的民众高达数千万。	In the United States, as much as 10% of public-sector spending on health care is lost to fraudulent billing, and tens of millions face significant economic barriers to health care.
据该机构估计，欧洲铀资源需求量将从2010年的2.1747万当量吨下降到2018年的1.7378当量吨，最终降低到2024年的约1.6万当量吨。	According to the agency’s forecast, uranium demand in Europe will fall from 21,747 tons in 2010 to 17,378 tons by 2018 and roughly 16,000 tons by 2024.
联合国粮食及农业组织（粮农组织）理事会决定，粮农组织的目标将不再仅仅是减少饥饿，而是消除饥饿、粮食不安全和营养不良。	The Council of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization decided that the FAO’s goal should no longer be merely to reduce hunger, but to eradicate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.
当今的关键全球问题 — — 恐怖主义和极端主义、贫困和不平等性、气候变化、移民以及传染病 — — 日趋严重。	Today’s key global problems – terrorism and extremism, poverty and inequality, climate change, migration, and epidemics – are worsening daily.
更糟糕的是，美国一直没有打好手上的牌迫使以色列改变主意，原因就在于美国国内的亲以色列游说集团，特别是美国以色列公共事务委员会（American Israel Public Affairs Committee，AIPAC）政治力量太强。	Making matters worse, the US has continually refrained from using its substantial leverage to compel Israel to change course, owing to the domestic political strength of the pro-Israel lobby, especially the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
美国出生的、颇受争议的辛普森温莎公爵夫人曾有一句不无讽刺的妙语 ： “ 再富都不够富，再瘦都不够瘦 。 ”	Wallis Simpson, the controversial US-born Duchess of Windsor, once famously quipped, “You can never be too rich or too thin.”
她们认为这是在侮辱她们的智商，特别是，年轻女性大多支持桑德斯；她们更喜欢他的竞选平台，质疑她的诚信。	They find that an insult to their intelligence, and young women in particular are largely supporting Sanders; they prefer his platform and are troubled by questions about her integrity.
表面上看，联合国似乎是领导重建的理想机构，因为和世界银行等发展机构不同，它能够整合政治和经济目标—这两个向和平过渡过程的对等部分。	On the surface, the UN seems ideally placed to lead reconstruction efforts because, unlike development institutions like the World Bank, it can integrate the political and economic objectives that are equal parts of a transition to peace.
例如，布什政府竭尽全力来掩盖身负重伤回国的老兵数目。 目前为止，已经达到1万6千人，包括大约20％脑部以及头部受重伤的人。	For example, the Bush administration has been doing everything it can to hide the huge number of returning veterans who are severely wounded – 16,000 so far, including roughly 20% with serious brain and head injuries.
想想韩国科学家黄禹锡吧，他声称已从他克隆的人体胚胎中提取干细胞，结果却是这项研究却根本就是欺世盗名。	Consider the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk, whose claim to have extracted stem cells from human embryos that he cloned turned out to be based on phony research.
而无限期QE实施过程中，通过抬升通胀预期压低实际利率的做法也有风险，最终会把高通胀预期的火焰煽起来。	And the reduction in real interest rates via a rise in expected inflation when open-ended QE is implemented risks eventually stoking inflation expectations.
“可预防死亡”在中低收入国家仍然司空见惯，这一事实表明我们的医疗体系低劣不堪或者资源不足，而不意味着我们缺少医学知识。	The fact that “preventable deaths” remain common in low- and middle-income countries is a symptom of broken or under-resourced health-care delivery systems, not a lack of medical know-how.
埃尔多安在巴尔干的讲话可能会惹怒欧洲和美国，甚至包括塞尔维亚和克罗地亚，但这样的讲话却可以提升土耳其人对他的支持度。	Erdoğan’s speeches in the Balkans might antagonize the United States and Europe, and even Serbs and Croats, but they raise his stock with Turks.
这些贷款的数字基本无从知晓，因为其中有许多来自中国的开发银行，它们的数据不在国际清算算银行（这类信息的主要全球来源）所收集的数据之内。	But the extent of that lending is largely unknown, because much of it came from development banks in China that are not included in the data collected by the Bank for International Settlements (the primary global source for such information).
虽然这条河可能不太出名，但却极其重要，因为它是巴拿马运河的水源，而巴拿马运河则承担着亚洲和美洲间50%的贸易运输任务。	While it may not be widely known, it is vitally important, as it feeds the Panama Canal, through which 50% of trade between Asia and the Americas flows.
德国已经成为第一大目的地，接受的难民占欧盟总量的近40 % ； 即使用人均衡量，也比欧盟平均水平高出数倍。	Germany has now become the main destination overall, receiving nearly 40% of the EU total; even on a per capita basis, this is several times more than the EU average.
假设此人找到了一个自由欧持有人愿意出手兑换，则会根据交易的额度，银行欧持有者的急迫程度，以及资本管制的预期持续时间而出现一个银行欧/自由欧汇率。	Assuming such depositors find FE holders willing to purchase their BE, a substantial BE-FE exchange rate emerges, varying with the size of the transaction, BE holders’ relative impatience, and the expected duration of capital controls.
开罗 — — “无论哪个党派在议会获得了绝大多数，他们都是受人欢迎的，因为他们无法实施任何人民不愿意实施的措施 。 ”	CAIRO – “Whatever the majority in the People’s Assembly, they are very welcome, because they won’t have the ability to impose anything that the people don’t want.”
哥本哈根—在过去的一个世纪里，确保妇女和女孩平等性的斗争在教室、投票站和《财富》500强公司董事会中进行着。	COPENHAGEN – During the last century, the battle to secure equality for women and girls has been fought in the classroom, in the voting booth, and in the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies.
在那些表示不会在今年的欧洲议会选举中投票的人中，有64 ％的人认为 ， “ 缺少信息”是他们做出此决定的原因，而有62 ％抱怨说他们的投票“不会促成任何改变 ” 。	Of those who said they wouldn’t be voting in this year’s European elections, 64% cited “lack of information” as the reason, with 62% complaining that their vote “wouldn’t change anything.”
学生可以完成临床前训练，而临床训练的一部分放在祖国进行，然后自主选择在美国或英国完成短暂的临床训练阶段。	Students could complete their preclinical training, and a portion of their clinical training, in their country of origin, and then be given the option of completing a temporary clinical-training stint in the US or the UK.
发自耶路撒冷 — — 虽然全世界媒体的头条都聚焦在了以色列为继续封锁加沙而进行的海上拦截行动上，但实际上中东地区还有某些更具历史意义的事件正在酝酿着。	JERUSALEM – Although the crisis over Israel’s naval interventions to defend its blockade of Gaza is gaining all the headlines around the world, something of far more historic importance is taking place in the Middle East.
随着全球化所带来的好处越来越明显，自给自足政策所造成的损害也不言而喻，东方国家的决策者开始明白自己反对全球化的立场是一个错误。	As the benefits of globalization became manifest, and the damage wrought by autarkic policies also became evident, policymakers in the East began to appreciate that their anti-globalization stance had been a mistake.
尽管服务业在过去能够带来增长，但作为就业岗位创造器，服务业并不出色，只雇用了27%的劳动力，远远低于其占经济规模的比重。	Although the service sector was able to generate growth in the past, it has proved to be a poor job creator and only employs 27% of workers, far lower than its share of the economy.
在选战期间，他大部分情况下只是重申传统的法国观念：一个共同的欧洲政府和一个欧元区财政部，以及各管各的公共投资融资预算。	During the electoral campaign, he mostly just rehashed the traditional French view: a common European government and a eurozone finance minister, with a separate budget to finance public investment.
伊朗的天然气资源即使得到充分开发也不会替代廉价核电，因为天然气用于其它用途比用来发电具有更高的经济效益。	Iran’s natural gas resources, if developed, would not be a substitute for cheap nuclear power, because gas is more profitable in other uses than in power generation.
首先希腊退出欧元区的进程可能只是被推迟，而非阻止，因为养老金和其他结构性改革使得该国与其欧洲债权人爆发了极大冲突。	For starters, a Greek exit from the eurozone may have been only postponed, not prevented, as pension and other structural reforms put the country on a collision course with its European creditors.
同样，脸书和谷歌主宰了数字广告市场，但它们从中获得的利润允许其提供表面上免费的电邮和社会媒体服务来使消费者受益。	Likewise, Facebook and Google dominate the digital advertising market, but their profits allow them to offer ostensibly free email and social-media services that benefit consumers.
资历较浅的美联储理事杰里米·斯坦因（Jeremy Stein）最近在一次演讲中解释了为什么大型金融机构内部的危险激励问题不可能通过监管得以纠正。	Jeremy Stein, a relatively new appointment to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, recently gave a speech explaining why dangerous incentive problems within large financial institutions will not be fixed by regulation.
然而，在中欧和东欧数以千记的政治犯可以证明下列事实：秘密警察在街头上的暴行造成的伤害与监狱里看守人的虐待造成的伤害一样严重。	However, thousands of former political prisoners in central and eastern Europe can attest to the fact that a kick from a secret policeman on the street hurts just as much as a kick from a warden behind prison gates.
然而即使如此，美国领导人也清楚意识到自由主义多边贸易体系的价值，并支持在1995年建立世界贸易组织来作为关税和贸易总协定的接班人。	Yet, even then, US leaders understood the value of the liberal multilateral trading system, and supported the establishment, in 1995, of the World Trade Organization as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
经济霸权只有在英国在一战和二战中积累了大量经常账户赤字 — — 因为必须大规模借贷来维持战争支出，而且进口远大于出口 — — 之后才最终易手。	Economic predominance shifted only when the UK ran large current-account deficits during World Wars I and II – the country had to borrow heavily in order to finance its war effort, and imports were significantly higher than exports.
通过立法或直接投票，大约有八百万工人在最近几年中喜迎最低工资上涨，自2017年以来，工人收入增加了50亿美元。	Through legislation or direct voter initiatives, approximately eight million workers have already won minimum-wage increases in recent years, and an additional $5 billion has made it into workers’ pockets since 2017.
实际上，中国主席胡锦涛一直声称不与参拜靖国神社的日本首相举行首脑会谈。 大部分中国人认为参拜是美化日本过去侵略和殖民历史。	Indeed, Chinese President Hu Jintao continually affirms that he will not hold a summit with a Japanese prime minister who goes to Yasukuni, which most Chinese regard as a glorification of past Japanese aggression and colonialism.
更有甚者，人们产生了欧洲理事会能以某种方式实现发展和生产率的错误看法，这给了本就不愿在国内推行不受欢迎政策的各国领导人转移目标的借口。	Moreover, the delusion that the European Council can somehow call growth and productivity into being has provided a diversion to national politicians who are unwilling to push for unpopular decisions back home.
他拒绝了共和党传统的亲商，亲贸易议程，转而跟左翼的伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）一样去讨好那些受到破坏性科技和“全球主义”自由贸易和移民政策压迫的美国人。	Trump rejected the Republican Party’s traditional pro-business, pro-trade agenda, and, like Bernie Sanders on the left, appealed to Americans who have been harmed by disruptive technologies and “globalist” policies promoting free trade and migration.
全世界退休基金、大学、保险公司资金池和主权财富基金正在面临持有石油、天然气和煤炭公司股票的日益增加的道德和财务风险。	Pension funds, universities, insurance pools, and sovereign wealth funds worldwide are grappling with the increasing risks, both moral and financial, of owning shares in oil, gas, and coal companies.
事实上，极少数敢于挑战这类统治的工人运动成员和知识分子也不是想改变整个系统，而只是想从中分一杯羹而已。	Indeed, the few trade unionists, intellectuals, and others who challenge these regimes usually do not seek to change how the state functions, but rather to ensure that, as they put it, they get their “turn to eat.”
恰恰相反，更需要这笔款项的路易斯安娜（该州贫困率达到了令人惊讶的24 % ） 却没有拿到2004年用于减灾的资金。	By contrast, a more needy Louisiana (with its staggering 24% poverty rate) was denied its request for flood-mitigation funds in 2004.
伦敦—在美国，对某个年龄层的人来说，玛格丽特·撒切尔是一颗超级巨星，美国人感到诧异的是，她执政了11年的英国对她的评价分歧如此之大。	LONDON – In the United States, for people of a certain age, Margaret Thatcher was a superstar, and Americans have been surprised at the sharply divided views on display in the Britain that she governed for 11 years.
美国官方数据显示，在截至今年8月的12个月中，总体进口物价下降了11 % ， 但这几乎完全是因为能源成本下降所致。	While official US data show overall import prices down 11% in the 12 months through August, this is almost entirely due to lower energy costs.
某些挑战已经十分明确，例如滥用社交媒体传播虚假信息 — — 以及利用诸如deepfake视频和人工智能等尖端工具。	Some challenges, such as the misuse of social media to spread disinformation – using, among others, cutting-edge tools like deepfake videos and artificial intelligence – are already clear.
其算盘是长期资本流为扩大的经常项目赤字融资（当时超过了GDP的8 % ） ，减轻外部融资骤停的风险。	The hope was that longer-term capital flows would finance the widening current-account deficit, which exceeded 8% of GDP at the time, mitigating the risk of a sudden stop in external financing.
尽管众所周知汇率的不可预测的，但是大家预言美国庞大的贸易赤字的缓慢冲销将使美元从长期来看会逐渐下跌。	Though exchange rates are notoriously unpredictable, the best guess is that a slow unwinding of the massive US trade deficit will keep the dollar on a path of gradual long-term decline.
直到20世纪70年代发生过度通胀，央行才发现 — — 或者，从某种程度上讲，是重新发现 — — 保持货币价值稳定是值得追求的。	It was not until the excessive inflation of the 1970s that central banks discovered – or, in a sense, rediscovered – the desirability of keeping the value of money stable.
据报道，美国正试图说服埃及、沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋和约旦建立逊尼派部队，承担在ISIS解放区维持秩序的任务。	The US is reportedly attempting to persuade Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan to create a Sunni force that would maintain order in areas liberated from ISIS.
但是，心理学在投机市场上也会起作用，或许格林兰冰川的消融使所有其它的事物 — — 土地，水，甚至是新鲜空气 — — 也都快用完了似乎成为事实。	But psychology also matters in speculative markets, and perhaps that image of the Greenland ice disappearing makes it seem all too plausible that everything else– land, water, even fresh air – is running out too.
首先也是最重要的是反应不力，这不啻于示弱，从而束缚了其扭转俄罗斯吞并克里米亚之势（在策略上，这一事实已经被接受）和遏制其面向东乌克兰的侵略行为的能力。	First and foremost, it has been anemic, projecting an image of weakness that undermines its ability to reverse Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which has been tacitly accepted, or counter its aggressive behavior toward eastern Ukraine.
她问了我一个我无法回答的简单问题 ： “ 世界上的人们怎么忍心去享用我这样的孩子流血采摘下来的橙子所制成的橙汁呢？	She asked me a simple question, to which I did not have an answer: “How can the world enjoy the juice from these oranges when children like me have to shed their blood to pluck them?”
而相对于从前那些试图（以各种名目）向希腊这个早已负债累累的国家增加债务的方案来说，这个方案还是挺受欢迎的。	This is a welcome contrast to the options considered so far, all of which involved – under different guises – foisting more debt onto a country that has too much of it already.
同时在政策执行一年后，宪政委员会已成功避免了走向“法官政府 ” ， 而是表达了与其他机构，特别是决策者共同探讨的真诚希冀。	At the same time, after one year of implementation, the Constitutional Council has avoided a drift toward a “government of judges,” instead indicating a genuine desire for dialogue with other institutions, notably policymakers.
在电脑屏幕里面，是一个虚拟的20世纪50年代的办公室，这个办公室里有文档、档案储存间以及一个垃圾桶。	Inside the computer screen is a virtual 1950’s office, with paper documents, filing cabinets, and a garbage can.

事实上，提振增长也许是中国政治领导人的主要动机，尽管人民银行仍关注推进加强市场在决定汇率中的作用这一长期目标。	In fact, bolstering growth might have been the primary motivation for the country’s political leaders, even as the PBOC remained focused on advancing the longer-term objective of strengthening the market’s role in determining the exchange rate.
菲德尔出席古共六大的举动 — — 此次会议的政治意义极为巨大，因为这是这位前领导人在2006年生病之后已经极少在公开场合露面 — — 似乎证实他也对这一安排表示赞同。	Fidel’s appearance at the Party’s congress – an event full of political significance, because he has only rarely participated in public events since becoming sick in 2006 – seemed to confirm his support for this outcome.
这一技术目前正在全球推广，让其他社会得以增加能源产量，既降低了它们对昂贵进口能源的依赖，也降低了它们的碳排放量。	This technology is now making its way around the globe, allowing other societies to increase their energy production and decrease both their reliance on costly imports and their carbon emissions.
尽管汉森的警示始于气候科学的起步阶段，但今天的科学家已经在二氧化碳排放、气候变化和恶劣天气之间建立了联系。	While Hansen’s warnings came when climate science was in its infancy, scientists today have connected the dots among CO2 emissions, climate change, and severe weather.
不幸的是，SCAF和穆尔西都不支持为妇女提供领导人角色机会（传统上，妇女没有这一权利）的自由主义制度。	Unfortunately, neither SCAF nor Morsi espouses the type of liberal regime that would provide women with opportunities to take on the leadership roles that have traditionally been denied to them.
不幸的是，虽然这场战争随着今年的深入而逐渐升级，但选择的条件决定了不会对全球贸易机制更深层次的缺陷做出任何修补。	Unfortunately, even as the battle escalates over the course of this year, the terms of the choice ensure that nothing will be done to address the global trade regime’s deeper flaws.
公私合作伙伴关系，像施耐德电气的能源供应计划，已经在全球范围内培养了许多电工，但非洲却仅占其中的一小部分。	Public-private partnerships, like Schneider Electric’s Access to Energy program, have trained many electricians globally, but only a fraction have been in Africa.
事实上，对遍布世界各地越来越多的民众而言，洪水、山体滑坡和热浪 — — 简而言之就是日本的夏天 — — 已经成为新常态。	In fact, for a growing number of people around the world, floods, landslides, and heatwaves – Japan’s summer in a nutshell – is the new normal.
如果戈登关于生产率增长缓慢的看法是对的，那么危机和公共财政混乱导致的债务积压的持续时间将远大于预期。	If Gordon is right about slow productivity growth, the debt overhang inherited from the crisis and public-finance woes will persist for much longer than anticipated.
如果每年的美联储预测都是由抛硬币决定，意味着我们如今已经连续开出了11个正面，一个背面也没有，而出现这种情况的概率是1/2048。	If each year of Fed forecasting were a coin toss, we would now have had eleven heads in a row, and zero tails. The odds of that happening are one in 2,048.
或许是出于这一原因，许多组织，包括某些最有名的在非洲工作的扶贫组织并没有对善举提出的信息要求做出回应。	Perhaps for this reason, many organizations, including some of the best-known anti-poverty organizations working in Africa, did not respond to GiveWell’s request for information.
随后在九月末，美国最高法院最终对曼纽尔·瓦尔（Manuel Valle）一案做出了裁定，而此人早在33年前已被判处了死刑（却一直未获执行 ） 。	As September drew to a close, the US Supreme Court reached its decision in the case of Manuel Valle, who had been sentenced to death 33 years earlier.
诚然，这一情况与最近全球化哀声一片形成了鲜明反差，而铁了心要采取贸易保护主义的美国特朗普政府可能让全球贸易陷入长期衰退。	To be sure, this finding is at odds with all of the eulogies for globalization that one hears these days, and Donald Trump’s decidedly protectionist administration in the US could now send global trade into a long retreat.
如果我们回顾以往，尤其是1900年义和团起义、以及第一次世界大战期间日本的表现，不难看出这一点。 当然，日本当时的处境和现在的处境有着很大不同。	It may be helpful to look back, in particular, to Japanese actions at the time of the Boxer Rebellion (1900), as well as during World War I. Of course, there are huge differences between the situation then and what Japan faces now.
看来，目前只有一件事情是确定的：没有一个单一政党会取得大多数的选票，印度还是在一个联合政府的统治之下。	Only one thing is certain: no single party will win a majority on its own. India is set for more coalition rule.
10亿人缺乏饮用水、20亿人缺乏合理的污水处理系统所带来的迫切需求，再加上随之而来的大量疾病，使这项基本人权的认定变得非常重要。	The urgency of the needs, with a billion people lacking access to drinking water and two billion without proper sewer systems, together with the vast number of diseases that result, underscore the need to recognize such a fundamental human right.
过早的财政紧缩和/或取消反周期经济政策威胁着对促进受危机影响最严重群体恢复至关重要的公共财政支持政策。	Premature fiscal contraction and/or withdrawal of countercyclical measures threaten the public support that is essential to promoting recovery among those hardest hit by the crisis.
但非洲决策者却面临着严重的问题：他们不知道自己究竟面对多少人、这些人住在哪里、以及他们如何解决生计问题。	But African policymakers confront a serious problem: they do not know how many people they are dealing with, where they live, or how they earn a living. Simply put, they don’t have enough data.
伊斯兰金融还可以增强金融包容性，因为它允许出于文化和宗教原因而被传统金融体系排除在外的民众共同参与。	Islamic finance also can enhance financial inclusion, as it incorporates people who, for cultural or religious reasons, are excluded from the traditional financial system.
产妇死亡数量可以下降三分之一，节省数百万美元（发展中国家总体而言，产妇和新生儿医疗成本节约可以达到57亿美元 ） 。	The number of maternal deaths could fall by one-third, saving millions (in developing countries overall, maternal and new-born health-care savings could reach $5.7 billion).
身为抗战游击队领袖，他协助在中国内战中打败了蒋介石的国民党，并历任中共中央委员会委员、宣传部长、副总理和广东省省长等职务。	A guerilla leader in the war against Japan, he helped to defeat Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists in China’s civil war, became a member of the Central Committee, and then chief of propaganda, Vice Premier, and Governor of Guangdong.

从一���始，该项目就是为了响应扩大医疗专家覆盖面的要求，并完全由加纳卫生部工作人员负责运营，这让该模式实现上规模、可持续。	From the outset, the project was a response to an expressed need to expand the reach of medical expertise, and was fully operated on the ground by Ghana Health Service staff, which made this model sustainable at scale.
未来几年（事实上是几十年）的显著特征将是美国-中国的此消彼长 — — 中国变得越来越强，而美国将持续弱势。	The coming years, indeed decades, will be characterized by an increasingly aggressive US-Chinese dualism as China becomes stronger and America’s weakness persists.
根据国际货币基金组织的最新预测，2017年欧元区整体将实现1.7％的增长，2018年则为1.6 ％ — —这相对几年前可谓极大改善，须知当时要实现1％的增长都极为勉强。	The latest International Monetary Fund forecast projects 1.7% growth for the eurozone as a whole in 2017, and 1.6% growth in 2018 – a remarkable improvement from a few years ago, when the region struggled to break 1%.
此外，依温特所言，如果他的团队的新技术能在明年面世的话，那就有可能制造出一种可以在24小时内生效的H1N1流感疫苗，再也不用等待几个月才能实现免疫。	And, according to Venter, if his team’s new technology had been available last year, it would have been possible to produce a vaccine to protect ourselves against H1N1 influenza in 24 hours, rather than several weeks.
1959年，国会为美国科学基金会（National Science Foundation，NSF）拨款1.34亿美元，较前一年的拨款增加了近1亿美元。	In 1959, Congress allocated $134 million to the National Science Foundation, an increase of nearly $100 million from the previous year.
但是，在过去几个月有关金融诈骗、印度和加沙流血以及全球经济灾难的新闻报导中，有一个事件则由于其勇敢和高尚而引人注目。	Yet, amidst the news reports over the past few months of financial fraud, bloodshed in India and Gaza, and global economic disasters, one item stood out for its bravery and nobility.
更多的美国孤立主义证据可以从皮尤研究中心（Pew Research Center）和外交关系委员会（Council of Foreign Relations）的最新民调中看出。	Further evidence of American isolationism can be found in a recent opinion poll taken by the Pew Research Center and the Council on Foreign Relations.
罗伯特·姆万加（Robert Mwanga）因为在用富含维生素A的品种大量替换乌干达农村穷人日常实用的甘白薯（维生素A含量很低）方面所取得的鼓舞人心的工作而被授予世界粮食奖。	Robert Mwanga was awarded this year’s World Food Prize for inspiring work that resulted in the large-scale replacement of white sweet potato (with scant Vitamin A content) by a vitamin A-rich alternative in the diets of Uganda’s rural poor.
于是乎，虽然股票市场暴跌和石油 (及其他大宗商品) 价格的进一步下跌引发了众多关于另一场全球经济衰退会否爆发的讨论，但这些可怕的预言有可能最终会被证明是过于悲观且误导性的。	As a result, while sliding equity markets and a further decline in oil (and other commodity) prices have sparked much talk of another global recession, dire predictions are likely to prove overly gloomy and misdirected.
2007年3月的决议则呼吁在向伊朗出售重型武器的时候要“审慎和克制 ” ， 并且避免新的赠款、财政援助或者减让性贷款。	The March 2007 resolution called for “vigilance and restraint” in the sale of heavy weapons to Iran and avoidance of new grants, financial assistance, or concessional loans.
1648年《威斯特伐利亚和约》使神圣罗马帝国的独立政治单位从3,000-4,000骤减至300-400个。	The 1648 Peace of Westphalia reduced the number of independent units in the Holy Roman Empire from 3,000-4,000 to 300-400.
紧急状况响应教育平台得到国际教育学院和催化剂普及教育基金会的全力支持，该基金会是由纽约大学校长约翰·塞克斯顿（John Sexton）创立的教育慈善机构。	PEER is being supported by the Institute of International Education and the Catalyst Foundation for Universal Education, an education charity founded by former New York University President John Sexton.
据守门员成绩报告显示，非洲小学入学儿童数从2000年的6，000万增加到今天的约2.5亿，而男孩和女孩的增长率几乎是相等的。	According to the Goalkeepers report, the number of children enrolled in primary school in Africa increased from 60 million in 2000 to some 250 million today, and the rate of growth was equal for boys and girls.
同样，很多渔业经营者的潜在子嗣最终选择了其他职业，现在可以借此机会对他们手中的资源进行重组和整合，借此充分发挥规模经济优势。	Similarly, individually operated fishing businesses whose potential heirs ended up choosing other careers can now be reorganized and consolidated, thereby taking advantage of greater economies of scale.
但是，有一点是肯定的：如果苏格兰在9月通过独立公投，那么失去苏格兰的英国对欧盟成员地位的公投将更加不可能产生希望留在欧洲派获胜的结果。	One thing, however, seems certain: If Scotland votes for independence in September, a referendum within the rump UK on continued EU membership would be even less likely to produce a victory for those who wish to remain.
这些现实主义者还认为，通过让欧盟的立场与北约一致，欧洲有欠考虑地选择了羞辱俄罗斯 — — 这样的行为是毫无用处的，并且是危险的。	Such realists also claim that by aligning the EU’s positions with those of NATO, Europe has recklessly chosen to humiliate Russia – a useless and dangerous course of action.
一个生物制药的早期例子是文特里亚生物科技公司（Ventria Bioscience）所生产的一种水稻，这种水稻包含两种人类蛋白质：乳铁蛋白和溶解酵素。	One early example of biopharming was the production by the biotech company Ventria Bioscience of rice that contained two human proteins, lactoferrin and lysozyme.
商业和消费者情绪的激增反映了一个在美国人心中根深蒂固的假设：放松管制和减税总能让驱动变革的增长型创业精神得到解放。	The surge in business and consumer sentiment reflects an assumption that is deeply rooted in the American psyche: that deregulation and tax cuts always unleash transformative pro-growth entrepreneurship.
最佳的情况可能是中国同意最迟于2011和2012年的选举中实施全民投票，通过支持政治体制改革在香港赢得信任。	The best case would be if China agreed to universal suffrage no later than the 2011 and 2012 elections, gaining legitimacy in Hong Kong by backing reform of the political system.
收入不平等恶化的问题绝不仅限于新兴市场，但公开腐败和普遍的不公相结合就造成了一股暗流，破坏了人们对增进和巩固经济利益所需要的改革的支持。	Rising income inequality is hardly limited to emerging markets, but their combination of open corruption and pervasive inequities creates a toxic brew that is undermining support for reforms that would strengthen and consolidate their economic gains.
安倍政府不但依赖其高支持率参与TPP，还依赖高支持率解决走出15年通缩、强化日本国家安全姿态（几十年来一直处于瘫痪状态）的需要。	The Abe government is banking on its high approval rating not only to participate in the TPP, but also to address the need to escape from 15 years of deflation and strengthen Japan’s national-security posture, which has been hamstrung for decades.
在此过程中，中国国有企业职工人数减少了5 000万，全国减少了2 500万个制造业岗位，中央政府工作人员数量也大幅下降。	In the process, the labor force of China’s state enterprises declined by 50 million, China lost 25 million manufacturing jobs, and central-government employment was slashed.
迪顿指出援助者必须极端谨慎，不要干涉那些随时间推移会引发有机 — — 并因此催生更持续内部变革 — — 的政治和社会力量。	Deaton argues that aid providers must be extremely careful not to interfere with political and social forces that, over time, can generate organic – and therefore more lasting – internal change.
公投之所以成为对伦齐及其政府的重要考验，在某种程度上是因为今年早些时候他头脑一热威胁说如果针对参议院的改革议案被否决就将辞去总理职务。	The referendum has become a litmus test for Renzi and his government partly because of his ill-considered warning earlier this year that he would resign if the proposed reform of the Senate (the parliament’s upper house) were voted down.
他警告说，如果国际社会不能走到一起，那将会出现“恶性循环”的通货紧缩，流动性陷阱以及越来越悲观的预期。	He warned that if the international community did not come together, “vicious cycles” of deflation, liquidity traps, and increasingly pessimistic expectations could take hold.
而在关塔纳摩湾一案中，布什政府申辩说有利于被拘押者的判决会使人力和物力从战场上转移到法庭中，从而削弱美国的战斗力。	In the Guantanamo Bay case, by contrast, the Bush Administration argued that a ruling for the detainees would undermine the war effort by diverting manpower and material from the battlefield to the courtroom.
几乎所有来自最富裕的20%的家庭的妇女都能享受到产检和高质量分娩服��；而最贫困人口的覆盖率还不到10 % — —比许多撒哈拉以南非洲地区还要糟糕。	Nearly all women from the richest 20% of households enjoy prenatal care and skilled attendants at delivery; coverage rates for the poorest are less than 10% – worse than in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
纽约 — — G-20已经结束了与叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德用毒气杀害1，400多名国内平民指控相关的会议和晚餐讨论。	NEW YORK – The G-20 has concluded its meetings and dinner discussions of what to do about charges that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has used poison gas to kill more than 1,400 of his own people.
利用美联储 在3月公布的信息，我们设想了两个情境 ： “ （火箭）发射”是基于最大的预期利率，而“延迟发射”则基于最低预期。	Using information released by the Fed in March, we have constructed two scenarios: “lift-off” is based on the maximum projected interest rates, while “delayed lift-off” is based on the minimum.
俄罗斯支持伊朗和叙利亚的什叶派政府，以确保其自身在中东的立场 — — 反对美国支持的沙特和海湾国家的逊尼派执政者（他们对以色列的威胁更小 ） 。	Russia supports the Shia governments of Iran and Syria in order to secure its own position in the Middle East against US-backed Sunni rulers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, who are less of a threat to Israel.
如此的战略无视今天100%劳动力的潜力，明年98 % ， 以及今后半个世纪仍有劳动能力的数量巨大的民众。	It is a strategy that ignores the potential that is in 100% of today’s labor force, 98% of next year’s, and a huge number of people who will be around for the next half-century.
盖茨非常了解美国糟糕的种族关系史，甚至可以说是这方面的专家，因此他本能地认为自己成了种族歧视的受害者。	Gates, deeply conscious, indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country, instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice.
据美国人口普查局，在2012年的总统竞选中，家庭收入不足每年20,000美元的合格候选人只有不到一半投了票，而家庭收入超过75,000美元的合格候选人投票率为77 % 。	According to the US Census Bureau, fewer than half of eligible adults with family incomes of less than $20,000 per year voted in the 2012 presidential election, whereas voter participation among households with incomes of more than $75,000 was 77%.
而这种发生在俄罗斯边界的流血事件可能正好给与普京一个求之不得的借口让其将宪法规定的任期延长到明年五月之后。	And such potential bloodshed on Russia’s border may give Vladimir Putin the pretext he may desire to extend his rule beyond its constitutionally mandated end next March.
但公平和互惠的感觉 — — 更不用说对国家的忠诚了 — — 在许多美国公司并不深刻，它们对此的反应是威胁要把总部迁往国外。	But a sense of fairness and reciprocity, much less national loyalty, is not deeply ingrained in many US companies, which respond by threatening to move their headquarters abroad.
毕竟经济发展和可持续增长本来就是产业和技术不断更新换代的产物，而这个更新过程则需要公共和私人部门协同一致才能实现。	After all, economic development and sustained growth are the result of continual industrial and technological change, a process that requires collaboration between the public and private sectors.
但运用自己土生土长的BREEP探索方法，中国学会了拒绝西方流行的一刀切经济发展理论，认识到促进城市间的竞争、试错、及多样化是探索及实现发展战略突破的很有价值的方法。	But, using its BREEP methodology, China has learned that rejecting one-size-fits-all approaches and promoting competition among cities is a valuable means of achieving breakthroughs in development strategies.
历史学家罗伯特·卡甘（Robert Kagan）在2002年指出，美国人和欧洲人不但世界观不同；所处的世界也完全不一样。	As the historian Robert Kagan argued in 2002, Americans and Europeans do not only have different worldviews; they occupy entirely different worlds.
甚至在某种程度上央行数字货币可能取代所有私人数字支付系统，无论它们对接的是传统银行账户还是加密货币。	If anything, CBDCs would likely replace all private digital payment systems, regardless of whether they are connected to traditional bank accounts or cryptocurrencies.
再加上地区政治军事安排不够充分，我们根本无法确定智慧能否战胜鲁莽，也无法确定亚洲独一无二的数十年和平能否继续惠及该地区民众。	Add to that inadequate regional political-military arrangements, and it is not at all certain that wisdom will triumph over recklessness, or that Asia’s unique decades-long peace will endure.
帝国可以在相当长的时间内带来秩序与稳定；但帝国主义者 — — 就像很多今天的美国人 — — 开始变得厌倦，他们的殖民地则越来越躁动。	Empires can impose order and stability for a long time; but imperialists – rather like many Americans today – become tired, and their subjects grow restless.
改变人们根深蒂固观念不可能一蹴而就：它需要有一个从基层到政治权力的高层进行信心塑造的，渐进式的过程。	There is no denying that strong bilateral ties are good for Greece’s economy and security.
这些协议参加国克制其消费，但是，只有让它们没有消费的矿物燃料留在地下才能使得这些国家做出的牺牲减缓二氧化碳造成的问题。	The sacrifices of the participating countries would alleviate the CO2 problem only if their restraint meant that some of the fossil resources they do not consume remain underground.
这些工作中有超过半数 — — 这些体面的工作可以提高贫困家庭的收入和生活水平 — — 主要分配给女性求职者。	More than half of those jobs – decent jobs that could raise incomes and living standards, particularly for poor households – would go to women.
因此中国 — — 美国第三大和增长最快的主要出口市场 — — 的前景对于美联储来说至关重要。 美联储的非常规危机后货币政策并没有带来很大的增长动力。	So the outlook for China, America’s third-largest and most rapidly growing major export market, is crucial for a Fed that has failed to gain much traction from its unconventional post-crisis monetary policies.
中国国有企业所扮演的角色以及中国政府对技术“国企巨头 ” （ national champion，拥有特权地位、几乎肯定会滥用政府资金的公司）的支持也损害了中美关系。	And the role of China’s state-owned enterprises and official Chinese support for technological “national champions” (privileged companies that almost certainly use government money carelessly) has also hurt relations.
例如，丙肝药物 Sovaldi 在美国每次治疗价格为84,000 美元；而印度药企的仿制药每次治疗价格不到1，000美元就有利可图。	For example, the Hepatitis-C drug Sovaldi is sold for $84,000 per treatment in the US; Indian manufacturers are able to sell the generic version profitably for less than $1,000 per treatment.
在世贸组织的164个成员国中，有158个与欧盟签署了或正在准备签署自由贸易协定，世贸组织规则之不受欢迎可见一斑。	To get a sense of just how undesirable these rules would be, consider that all but six of the WTO’s 164 members either has an FTA with the EU, or is working to establish one.
但让教员将大部分教学时间用于帮助学生通过讨论和练习参与到活跃学习之中，而不是用于有时可以做到百里挑一的讲课，不是更有意义吗？	But wouldn’t it make more sense for the bulk of faculty teaching time to be devoted to helping students engage in active learning through discussion and exercises, rather than to sometimes hundredth-best lecture performances?
换成是不久前，媒体会用这样的标题攻讦两人 ： 《 教授们的经济学是“优 ” ， 但政治不及格 》 。	Not long from now, both men will most likely provoke headlines such as the following: “Professors Earn ‘A’ in Economics, but Flunk Politics.”
人们终于认识到出身极右翼并在德国受哲学家马丁·海德格尔及其追随者助长的反美主义其实质属于法西斯主义现象。	People have finally come to understand that anti-Americanism, born on the extreme right and fed, in Germany, for example, by the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and his acolytes, is a fixture of fascism.
普林斯顿—去年今日，国际货币基金组织（IMF）宣布了令人失望的2015年全球增长率 — — 3.1 % ， 并憧憬2016年和2017年增长率有所上升。	PRINCETON – At this time last year, the International Monetary Fund reported disappointing global GDP growth of 3.1% in 2015, and promised that growth would increase in 2016 and 2017.
事实上印度，墨西哥，巴西和其他国家的政治家们已经呼吁本国实施减税以保持竞争力，吸引外国投资以及创造或保存就业机会。	In fact, politicians in India, Mexico, Brazil, and other developing countries are already calling for tax cuts of their own, in order to remain competitive, attract foreign investment, and create or save jobs.
伦敦—如今，大部分富裕国家都存在几百万“工作的穷人 ” — —工作收入无法让他们生活在贫困线以上，因此必须领国家补贴的人。	LONDON – Most rich countries now have millions of “working poor” – people whose jobs do not pay enough to keep them above the poverty line, and whose wages therefore have to be subsidized by the state.
此外，俄罗斯、巴西、印尼和南非等资源富裕国并没有在贸易条件优势消失前预先采取措施，这些国家一直面临工资成本增长和供给能力限制。	Moreover, nothing was done in anticipation of the end of terms-of-trade gains in resource-rich countries like Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa, which have been facing rising wage costs and supply-capacity limits.
但是，与2011年不同的是，当时极少数亲西方自由派和数量庞大的城市中产阶级年轻人群起反对穆巴拉克，而如今同一个群体支持政变，使政变具有了一定程度的（民主的？	But, unlike in 2011, when the few pro-Western liberals and huge numbers of urban, middle-class youth rallied against Mubarak, now the same groups support the coup, lending it a certain (democratic?) legitimacy.
毕竟，他表现出对个人的（personal ） 、 双边的协议的强烈偏好，如同他为他的企业签订的那些协议，而对投入正式的、多边性质甚少的外交没有什么兴趣。	He has, after all, shown a clear preference for personal, bilateral deals, like those he makes with his businesses, rather than engaging in formal, much less multilateral, diplomacy.
但通过将其独特精神和定义灌输到我们的思维中，我们的城市其实可以赋予人类更多的力量去应对21世纪的挑战。	But, by infusing us with their unique spirit and identity, our cities may, in fact, help to empower humanity to face the most difficult challenges of the twenty-first century.
在经历了20年的低增长和通缩之后，日本的总公共债务已经超过了GDP的240 % （ 如果以净债务计算的话则超过GDP的140 % ） ；同时在相当于GDP9.5%的财政赤字之下，债务负担依然在不断增长。	After two decades of low growth and deflation, Japanese gross public debt is now above 240% of GDP (and above 140% of GDP on a net basis); and, with the fiscal deficit at 9.5% of GDP, the debt burden continues to increase.
提高金融系统的透明度也有助于遏制腐败，而民间社会团体、记者和病人则应当推动政府和医疗服务机构加强问责。	Improving transparency in financial systems could also help curb corruption, while civil-society groups, journalists, and patients should push for greater accountability from governments and medical providers.
所有这些都是20世纪二三十年代的伟大理论家所耳熟能详的，包括哈耶克、奈特（Frank Knight）和凯恩斯。	All of this was known to the great theorists of the 1920s and 1930s: Hayek, Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes.
但眼睁睁看着这么多鱼类在自己手中令人震惊地陷于崩溃，让曾经丰饶的海洋环境和众多渔民的生活生计在自己面前受到削弱和破坏的管理机构同样可能无法摆脱厄运。	But so, too, could be the organizations that have presided over a breathtaking collapse of so many fisheries and left a once-bountiful marine environment – and the lives and livelihoods of many fishermen – damaged and degraded in their wake.
我也可以想象可以让穷国变富的选择，那就是，邓小平在1956年而非1976年成为中国领导人就可能让中国变得富有。	I can also envision alternatives that would have enriched poor nations: Deng Xiaoping becoming China’s leader in 1956 rather than 1976 would have done the job there.
容我解释一下，在老一辈人的一生中，成功地定义就是不断增长的GDP，更多的人能赚到更多的钱，更多的资源来资助公共项目，还有更多的工作机会。	Let me explain. For all of our lives, my generation has defined success in terms of rising GDP growth: more money in more pockets, more resources for public programs, and more jobs.
所有立法者 — — 不论是否支持特朗普，不论是共和党还是民主党 — — 必须充分参与缓解紧张、改善合作、保护美国政治制度中的制衡。	All legislators – whether pro- or anti-Trump, Republican or Democrat – must participate fully in the effort to reduce tensions, improve cooperation, and protect the US political system’s checks and balances.
欧洲大陆最成功的经济体 — — 德国坚持要伙伴国效仿其财政保守主义榜样，抑制了可以让痛苦的改革更容易实施的增长。	The continent’s most successful economy, Germany, insists that its partners follow its brand of fiscal conservatism, choking off the growth that would make painful reforms easier to implement.
政府20世纪80年代在黎巴嫩建立真主党游击队武装的行动也扩大了这种影响，进而加强了对该地区最为重要的什叶派区域的控制。	It was also strengthened by the regime’s activities in the 1980’s, when it created Hezbollah as a guerilla organization in Lebanon, thereby expanding its domination over the most important Shiite areas in the region.
但这种做法虽然能在短期内服务于美国的利益，但最终还是会在这个本已麻烦不断的区域引发不稳定和社会暴力。	But while this may seem to serve US interests today, it will eventually stoke instability and social violence that could spill over in an already-troubled region.
诚然，世界油价的大幅下跌对哥伦比亚是个不利的消息 — — 近几年来，哥伦比亚已成为主要碳氢产品生产国。	To be sure, the sharp drop in world oil prices is bad for Colombia, which in recent years has become a major hydrocarbons producer.
如果这一增长是由过度杠杆支撑的，那其实是在将未来的消费挪到现在，中国就将面对一场严重经济减速 — — 甚至可能是一场重大危机。	If it is supported by excessive leverage, effectively shifting future consumption to the present, China could face a significant slowdown – or even a major crisis.
研究最明确的结论质之一是我们需要武装应对日益严重的药物和杀虫剂抗药性，投资于下一代疟疾疗法的研究和开发。	One of the study’s clearest takeaways is that we need to arm ourselves against the rising threat of drug and insecticide resistance by investing in research and development for next-generation antimalarial treatments.
然而，尽管军费不足，普京似乎还是沉迷于毫无意义的挑衅姿态中，比如恢复远程核轰炸机在美国海岸之外巡航。	Yet, despite this spending shortfall, Putin seems obsessed with making pointless and provocative gestures, such as resuming long-range nuclear bomber flights off the American coast.
如果同样的事情发生在哈莱姆区，或另外一个主要由黑人构成的穷人聚居区内一个无名小卒的身上，那么也许根本就不会有人知道。	If the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem, or some other poor, or predominantly black district, no one would ever have heard about it.
从这个意义上讲，就业与冲突具有相关性，但重要的却不是绝对的就业水平，而是好工作在不同宗教或种族团体之间的分配状况。	In this sense, employment is relevant, but what matters is not the absolute level of employment so much as the distribution of good jobs among religious or ethnic groups.
上述企业也正在进入哥伦比亚革命武装力量撤出的哥伦比亚亚马逊地区 — — 那里覆盖的原始森林正面临被摧毁的威胁。	Such companies are also gaining access to areas of the Colombian Amazon evacuated by the FARC – areas covered in virgin forests that are now in danger of being destroyed.
克林顿此行以紧张的中美年度战略与经济对话开幕，谈判从一开始就受到了正在美国驻北京大使馆避难的盲人人权活动家陈光诚所处困境的威胁。	Her trip opened with the always-tense annual US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, which was threatened at the start by the plight of the blind human-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, who had taken refuge in the United States’ embassy in Beijing.
除了以色列右翼坚持绝不可在领土问题、耶路撒冷和巴勒斯坦人回归权利等问题上有半点让步，显然克里从来没有获得过真正的机会。	Add to that the Israeli right’s insistence that no concessions are possible on territorial issues, Jerusalem, or the Palestinians’ right of return, and it is clear that Kerry never really had a chance.
尽管如此 ， 《 新英格兰医学期刊 》 （ New England Journal of Medicine）上发表的一篇2012年的突破性研究分析了一个只在全世界500个家族身上发生的罕见基因突变，该突变会导致50岁前罹患阿尔茨海默症。	That said, a groundbreaking 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, analyzed a rare genetic mutation found in just 500 families around the world, which would lead to Alzheimer’s before the age of 50.
以智利为例。 智利是拉丁美洲最富裕、也许也是最成功的国家之一，总是喜欢自比于澳大利亚、新西兰和加拿大等治理良好的资源富裕国。	Consider Chile, one of Latin America’s richest and arguably most successful countries, which likes to compare itself to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, well-run countries that are rich in natural resources.
而布加勒斯特宫殿的内部装饰不过是唐纳德·特朗普在佛罗里达和纽约住所的升级豪华版，采用了令人心跳加速的路易十四风格。	And the interior of the palace in Bucharest, a kind of Louis XIV style on steroids, is just a more extravagant version of Donald Trump’s living quarters in Florida and New York.
而这样的结果对于一场曾经连是否能举办都成问题的峰会来说已经不错了：须知早先计划4月在曼谷举行的会议就被支持前首相他信·西那瓦的“红衫军”给搅黄了。	Not bad for a summit that some feared would not happen at all: an earlier meeting planned for April in Bangkok had been disrupted by protesters – “red shirts” who support ousted Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra.
但伊斯兰沙拉菲主义（原教旨主义宗教激进分子）首先是伊斯兰教全球化和西方化、以及更为广义的文化与宗教分离的恶果。	But Islamic Salafism (fundamentalist religious radicalism) is above all a consequence of the globalization and Westernization of Islam, and of the decoupling of culture and religion more generally.
比如，最近我在众议院金融服务委员会的一次立法听证上做了陈词。 这项立法有共和党提出，旨在更大地限制美联储的货币政策和监管权力。	For example, I recently testified at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee on Republican-proposed legislation that would impose on the Fed greater limitations on both monetary policy and regulation.
他们一般投票率更高、更愿意参与公民活动、更倾向于远离犯罪、更好地教育子女、并且因为生活方式更健康而减少患病的几率。	They also tend to vote at higher rates, engage in more civic activities, commit fewer crimes, educate their children better, and get sick less frequently by adopting healthier lifestyles.
这些统治者不让人民生产自己的商品，反而从欧洲进口商品，用来交换的则是他们自己的占有物 — — 或是邻国统治者的占有物 — — 黑奴。	Instead of having their peoples begin to manufacture their own goods, these rulers chose to import them from Europe in exchange for their own subjects – or the subjects of neighboring rulers – whom they exported as slaves.
这一发现使在疾病自我恶化之前很久就确诊成为了可能，也让开发预防 — — 甚至逆转 — — 癌症发展的药物成为可能。	Such findings unlock the possibility of a diagnostic test well before the disease manifests itself, and of developing drugs that prevent – or even reverse – the cancer’s development.
我们必须创建新的企业，而现代金融市场相比起为新兴企业提供资金（尤其是中小���业）却更善于投机和剥削。	New firms must be created, and modern financial markets are better at speculation and exploitation than they are at providing funds for new enterprises, especially small and medium-size companies.
正如巴勒斯坦解放组织在黎巴嫩一直存在到1982年，使其中寄居国不幸地陷入了内战，并导致强权国家入侵，最终引发更多的极端主义运动 — — 红色高棉, 黎巴嫩真主党以及伊斯兰圣战组织。	Like the PLO presence in Lebanon until 1982, this strategy plunged hapless host countries into civil war and provoked invasions by stronger powers, in turn spurring more extremist movements – the Khmer Rouge, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad.
该法案是在没有就其对医疗保健的潜在影响进行任何有意义辩论的情况下在国会草草通过并由总统签署成为法律的。	The bill was rushed through Congress and signed into law without any meaningful debate about its potential effects on health care.
事实上，市场的大失败随处可见 — — 比如碳排放、生物多样性、生态系统功能等 — — 并在加剧环境风险和生态稀缺，破坏人类福利和社会公平。	Indeed, the deep and pervasive market failures – in carbon emissions, biodiversity, and ecosystem services – are accelerating environmental risks and ecological scarcities, and undermining human well-being and social equity.
这一变化与美国两党间的初步共识一致 — — 更加积极地遏制中国 — — 因此有望在特朗普卸任后继续保持下去。	Because this change aligns with an incipient US bipartisan consensus in favor of more assertive action to constrain China, it is likely to outlast Trump’s presidency.
最近，大毒枭“矮子”华金·古兹曼（Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman）从一间墨西哥监狱中越狱，凸显出边境墙的另一个弱点：地道。	The recent escape of the drug cartel leader Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman from a Mexican prison highlights another vulnerability of border walls: tunnels.
在西班牙，人民党（PP）在强硬派的帕博罗·卡萨多（Pablo Casado）的领导下，已经公开成为民族主义政党。	In Spain, the People’s Party (PP) has become openly nationalist under the leadership of the hardline Pablo Casado.
而一旦出现耐药性，治疗效果就会大打折扣，进一步的耐药性就会产生，而且具有耐药性的有机体可以传染给其他民众，从而导致对正规治疗没有反应的严重耐药性的产生。	Once this resistance develops, treatment is compromised, further resistance can evolve, and resistant organisms can be transmitted to other people, leading to primary drug resistance that may fail to respond to standard therapy.
瓦加杜古—布基纳法索位于萨赫勒地区的中心地带，这意味着在气候变化问题中，它是全世界最容易受影响的国家之一。	OUAGADOUGOU – Burkina Faso is located in the heart of the Sahel, which means that it is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries when it comes to climate change.
此外其他地区也有很多令人兴奋的发展，包括印尼，菲律宾、孟加拉、尼日利亚和墨西哥 — — 都属于我称之为“未来十一国（Next 11 ） ” 的成员。	But there are plenty of exciting developments elsewhere, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Mexico – all part of what I call the “Next 11.”
显而易见的解释是这样一个事实：和美国总统特朗普和整个欧洲的民粹主义领导人一样，内塔尼亚胡通过唤醒民众的基地部落本能积累政治资本。	The obvious explanation lies in the fact that, like US President Donald Trump and populist leaders throughout Europe, Netanyahu amasses political capital by appealing to the population’s base tribal instincts.
像发达世界其他国家一样，金融危机严重打击了法国经济，导致生产停滞、失业率升高、就业不确定性上升、政府债务飙升，股市也面临崩溃的危险。	Like everywhere else in the developed world, the global crisis has hit the French economy hard, with output stagnating, unemployment rising, job insecurity mounting, government debt soaring, and the stock market at risk of crashing.
有些国家在过去半个世纪时间里，已经成功地在其法律文化内部建立起对法律合宪性进行审查的司法形式，法国也幸运地位列其中之一。	France is thus joining the cohort of countries that, over the past half-century or so, have developed within their legal culture a judicial form of constitutional review of legislation.
并且一切都是透明的；Watsi的所有财务记录都能通过谷歌透明资料（Google Transparency Document）查看。	And everything is visible; all of Watsi’s financial records are accessible on a Google Transparency Document.
从这个角度讲，中国或印度的经济成功也许是这些国家分裂的原因，因为中产阶级的正值渴望将使当前制度安排无法正常运转下去。	In that sense, economic success in China or India may be those states’ undoing, as middle-class political aspirations render current arrangements dysfunctional.
公众正日益裂化为一个个由思维相似人群组成的小群体，他们看到于自己类似的观点回荡在博客，评论，和推特中，无需接触不同的观点，而这些不同的观点也被视作反对派的宣传 ） ， 事实上就算作为一名政客而落选了，桑托勒姆的新声望也足以令他转型为媒体煽动者而拥有成功的事业。	The public is increasingly segmented into groups of likeminded people who see their views echoed back to them in blogs, comments, and tweets. There is no need to be exposed to different opinions, which are, in any case, considered to be propaganda.
事实上，巴勒斯坦人和以色列左翼似乎突然之间成为特朗普的“迷弟迷妹 ” ， 尽管这与其说意味着真正的突破机会，不如说体现了他们的绝望。	In fact, both the Palestinians and the Israeli left seem to have suddenly become infatuated with Trump, though that may signal their despair more than a real chance of a breakthrough.
这代表着一种对于一部分思想家的严肃挑战。 他们有时嘲讽民族的概念本身，认为我们现在生活在一个“后民族”的世界。	This represents a serious challenge to thinkers who sometimes ridicule the idea of the nation itself, arguing that we now inhabit a “post-national” world.
根据国会预算办公室的测算 — — 其具有相当好的历史记录 — — 共和党提出的医保立法将导致2,000多万美国人失去医疗保险。	According to the estimates produced by the Congressional Budget Office, which has a very good track record, the Republicans’ proposed health-care legislation would have caused more than 20 million Americans to lose insurance coverage.
结果是，这个仇外的种族主义政党，与伟大的法国的一切品质格格不入的政党，在所有志在必得的选区中都被击败了。	The result is that a xenophobic, racist party, one hostile to everything essential to the spirit and greatness of France, was defeated in all of the contests that it was supposed to win.
· 卡尔扎伊的继任者须有能力统一各自为政的种族和政治集团 — — 这一艰巨使命只有信誉卓著、广受尊敬的领袖才能实现。	· The ability of Karzai’s successor to unite disparate ethnic and political groups – a tall order that can be filled only by a credible and widely respected leader.
该组织认为，资本账户自由化有利有弊，因此“自由化需要进行周密策划，制定时间表，并循序渐进以保证其利大于弊 ” 。	The IMF now recognizes that capital-account liberalization comes with risks as well as benefits, and that “liberalization needs to be well planned, timed, and sequenced in order to ensure that its benefits outweigh the costs.”
事实上，中国再三使用化整为零的伎俩，将其战略分解为多个部分，分别推进，使各不同部分的推进所遇到的阻力最小化。	Indeed, it has repeatedly shown a knack for disaggregating its strategy into multiple parts and then pursuing each element separately in such a manner as to allow the different pieces to fall into place with minimal resistance.
美国经济目前的年均增长为1.6 % ， 即便住宅和制造业都已经出现温和复苏，加上QE3，都能将美国2013年的增长保持在这一水平，但即便是1%的财政拖累都将意味着经济增长会在2013年近乎停滞。	With the US economy currently growing at a 1.6% annual rate, a fiscal drag of even 1% implies near-stagnation in 2013, though a modest recovery in housing and manufacturing, together with QE3, should keep US growth at about its current level in 2013.
大选前的总体印象是伊朗最高领袖哈梅内伊支持贾里里（Saeed Jalili）或卡利巴夫（Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf ） 。	The general impression before the election was that Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, supported either Saeed Jalili or Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf.
但在人们对前首相托尼·布莱尔判断及流程出错导致英国和美国一道卷入伊拉克战争的狂热关注中，真正的教训却有可能被人们忽略掉。	But in the frenzied focus on former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s errors of judgment and process in bringing the UK into the war alongside the United States, the real lessons risk being lost.
事实上，土耳其一直与库尔德地区政府关系密切 — — 双边贸易规模近年来不断扩大，而库尔德地区政府的输油管道则向土耳其控制地区延伸 — — 因为埃尔多安政府将其视作对土耳其库尔德工人党势力的平衡。	In fact, Turkey has strong relations with the KRG – bilateral trade has lately been expanding, and KRG oil pipelines extend into Turkish territory – because Erdoğan’s government views it as a counterweight to Turkey’s PKK.
两周前，赖斯博士就任美国国务卿后，首次来到北约总部进行访问，并与北约各国外交部长就中东和平进程问题进行会晤。	When Dr. Rice made her first visit as Secretary of State to NATO headquarters two weeks ago, Alliance Foreign Ministers had a discussion about the Middle East Peace Process.
而菲律宾也得以大大提高了其在透明国际（Transparency International）年度腐败排行榜上的排名，从 2010年的134名（与尼日利亚相当）上升到去年的第94名（与印度并列 ） 。	As a result, the Philippines has dramatically improved its ranking in Transparency International’s annual corruption index, rising from a 134th-place tie with Nigeria in 2010, to 94th place, alongside India, last year.
虽然梅杰成功地带领英国经济实现了后衰退时代的复苏，但他却在1997年输给了东尼·布莱尔，断送了保守党18年执政并迎来了工党的13年统治，而这13年的执政似乎也将在5月6日英国人投下一票后宣告落幕。	Despite piloting the economy through a post-recession recovery, Major lost to Tony Blair in 1997, ending 18 years of Conservative government and bringing a 13-year Labour run, which will probably end when Britain votes for a new government on May 6.
有关宗教和科学的丑陋辩论通常看似局限在美国。 但是，最近几个月来，这场辩论开始蔓延，首先到欧洲，然后遍布全球。	Ugly debates about religion and science usually seem to be confined to the United States. In recent months, however, such debates have begun to spread – first to Europe and then around the world.
诚然，墨西哥生产商可能选择承担2.5%的美国进口汽车关税，而不去满足ROO或工资要求（从而也不必顾及进口配额 ） 。	To be sure, Mexican producers will probably choose to incur the costs of the 2.5% US tariff on imported cars rather than meet the ROO or wage requirements (hence the need for import quotas).
实力强大和集中领导的工会组织造成工资差异的缩减和对公司利润的挤压。 在这一期间，工作、储蓄以及开创企业的经济激励遭到了削减。	Economic incentives to work, save, and start businesses were also reduced through the compression of wage differentials and a big squeeze on company profits, both largely the result of strong and centralized labor unions.
新的私人部门就业岗位能够为海湾地区创造新的活力，有助于使该地区不再过度依赖能源出口、打造通往可持续长期增长的新道路。	New private-sector jobs could generate a wave of dynamism in the Gulf region, helping it to move away from overreliance on energy exports and forge a new path towards sustainable long-term growth.
这个观点是正确的，但是，它只是事情的一部分，因为它忽略了在关键时刻，自由贸易是怎样获得众多胜利者的支持的。	This is true, but it is only half the story, for it ignores how, at crucial moments in history, free trade has mustered the support of the many winners.
相反，美国的战略一直深得十九世纪海军上将阿尔弗雷德·马汉（Alfred Mahan）的地缘政治理论的精髓，强调海权和沿海。	American strategy, in contrast, has long favored the geopolitical insights of the nineteenth-century admiral Alfred Mahan, who emphasized sea power and the rimlands.
阿富汗继任政府拒绝承认被称为杜兰线（Durand line，由英国殖民者划定的分割庞大的普什图族的边界）的阿巴边界。	Successive Afghan governments have refused to recognize the frontier with Pakistan known as the Durand line, a British-colonial invention that split the large ethnic Pashtun population.
延长该计划的制定流程将适得其反，刺激大量受人关注的关于新欧洲（不论是否包括英国）应该是一副什么样子的讨论。	Prolonging the plan’s development process would have the opposite effect, by helping to spur a broad – and attentive – discussion on what the new Europe, with or without the UK, should look like.
石油输出国必须进一步提高它们的财政支出；日本和欧元地区必须通过结构改革刺激经济更快地增长；而美国必须实施具体的措施以保持更高的储蓄。	Oil exporters must increase fiscal spending further; Japan and the Euro area must trigger higher growth through structural reforms; and the US must implement concrete measures to sustain higher savings.
但如今，巨大的债务制约了美国 — — 更不用说制约了欧洲和日本 — — 继续做出如此巨大的贡献的能力。	But massive debts have lately undermined the ability of the US – not to mention Europe and Japan – to continue making such large contributions.
虽然在包括我在内的许多观察家眼中，借助欧洲经济区协议进入单一市场的渠道已不复存在，但如果我们错了呢？	In the view of many observers, including me, access to the Single Market through the EEA is no longer available. But what if we’re wrong?
与当时一样，今天的投资水平和质量也一直欠缺，对有形和无形资本 — — 长期增长的关键因素 — — 的公共支出持续大大低于最有水平。	And now, as then, the level and quality of investment have been consistently inadequate, with public spending on tangible and intangible capital – a critical factor in long-term growth – well below optimal levels for some time.
P5+1还可以争取让伊朗停止富尔道（Fordow）深度低下核浓缩设施运转，作为交换，P5+1可以向伊朗提供研究用燃料棒并冻结某些制裁措施。	They might also seek a standstill on the deep underground enrichment facility at Fordow, near Qom, in exchange for provision of fuel rods for Iran’s research reactor and a freeze on some sanctions.

临近的俄罗斯则越来越像总统弗拉迪米尔·普京的个人秀，此人似乎有意重燃与美国之间的冷战，而不是构建反映俄罗斯不断衰落现实的可行性战略关系。	Nearby Russia is increasingly a one-man-show under President Vladimir Putin, who seems intent on refighting the Cold War with the US, rather than constructing viable strategic relationships that reflect Russia’s diminished reality.
但埃尔多安的扩张性政策加剧了土耳其的结构性失衡，通胀上升到两位数，名义利率达到了16 % ， 经常项目赤字超过国民收入的16 % 。	But Erdoğan’s expansionary policies have compounded the country’s structural imbalances, with inflation rising to double digits, nominal interest rates reaching 16%, and the current-account deficit surpassing 6% of national income.
这是一个横亘在贸易和技术等领域的赢家和输家之间的鸿沟，也正是这一差距有效解释了去年的脱欧公投为何能获得通过。	One is the chasm between the winners and losers from trade and technology, a gap that goes a long way to explaining last year’s pro-Brexit vote.
该计划的目标通过金融部门改革、疏通商业法规、开放对外贸易以及减弱政府在经济中所扮演的作用来是消除增长中的官僚主义约束。	It was aimed at removing bureaucratic constraints to growth by restructuring the financial sector, streamlining business regulations, liberalizing foreign trade, and reducing the government’s role in the economy.

Only recently, George W Bush evicted North Korea from his “axis of evil” by removing that country from America’s list of countries that sponsor terrorism.
上述第二个时期对货币制度的探索又可分为两个阶段：第一阶段的侧重点是货币总量目标法（monetary targeting ） 。	The search for a monetary rule during the latter period had two phases: in the earliest attempt to construct a basis for stable monetary policy, the emphasis was on monetary targeting.
伊朗直接或通过真主党和哈马斯等组织曾经并将继续实施的行动对于伊拉克、阿富汗、黎巴嫩和巴勒斯坦的未来将产生重要并且大部分是负面的影响。	What Iran does directly and through such groups as Hezbollah and Hamas has and will continue to have a major and mostly adverse impact on the future of Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Palestine.
政府必须找出防止一小撮人利用群体效应作为政治资本的办法，从而防止群体规模膨胀到比选票数量还要大的程度。	Governments must find a way to prevent small groups from using the crowd effect as political capital, thereby causing crowd sizes to become more decisive than the number of ballots cast.

“安全校园计划 ” （ Safe Schools Initiative）将联合基于学校和社区的计划，采取特殊手段保护最危险地区约5,000所小学和中学的学生安全。	The “Safe Schools Initiative” will combine school and community-based plans with special measures to protect children attending some 5,000 primary and secondary schools in the most vulnerable areas.
各大中央银行都被指派了一些其手中工具和手段都无力达成的政策目标，而一部分精英则在等待机会将经济表现疲弱的罪责推到货币政策制定者身上。	Central banks have been left largely alone with objectives that exceed the capacity of their tools and instruments, while elements of the elite wait for a chance to blame monetary policymakers for weak economic performance.
即便是在经济快速发展的国家，由人口统计上的巨大变化所驱动的一系列因素，已经悄然将知识、社会责任和生活机会的不平等从一代人转移到下一代人。	Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next.
最重要的是，园丁并不是为了植物而管理花园，而是为了其它目的-获取食物、种植花草或仅仅是让花园看上去漂亮。	Most importantly, the gardener does not manage the garden for the sake of the plants, but for some other goal - to raise food, produce flowers, or just to look pretty.
结果，一百多万例活跃病症得到了成功治疗，致死病例 — — 造成印尼经济生产率损失的程度高达数百万美元 — — 也有所减少。	As a result, more than one million active cases have been successfully treated, while the incidence of the disease – which has cost Indonesia’s economy millions of dollars in lost productivity – has been driven down.
对其他人来说问题仍然存在：这个国家是否依然奉行宽容和多元化、珍视其国内体系和宪法传统、并因为价值观而受到世界各国的尊重 ？ ”	For the rest of us, the question remains: Will it still be a country with a tolerant and plural society, proud of its institutions and its constitutional traditions, and admired for its values throughout the world?
没人愿意购买资产并且承担额外的不确定因素，因为所有人都担心有些人了解的情况比他们多。 那也就是说，谁购买谁就是傻瓜。	No one is willing to buy assets and take on additional uncertainty, because everyone fears that somebody else knows more than they do – namely, that anyone would be a fool to buy.
我们有许多这样的例子，我们所需要的只是有更好的信息去找到它们并且采取行动，不管是在政府内部还是在私营部门。	There are many such examples; all we need is better information to find them and take action, whether inside the government or in the private sector.
事实上，联邦预算委员会的经验规则表明，真实GDP增长率持续短缺1个百分点相当于在10年的时间里增加大约3万亿美元的预算赤字。	Indeed, a CBO rule of thumb equates a sustained one-percentage-point shortfall in real GDP growth with budget deficits that are roughly $3 trillion larger over a ten-year period.
此人曾经在2000发表长篇讲话，反对那些将印度和中国这类国家转变成全球增长引擎，减少贫困，并且令边缘群体收益的自由化改革，这显示出他对某些基本问题缺乏判断。	His tirade in 2000 against the liberal reforms that have transformed countries like India and China into global growth engines, reduced poverty, and benefited marginalized groups shows that he lacked good judgment on fundamental issues.
SDSN动员来自学界、公民社会和私人部门的科学和技术专家支持地方、国家和全球层面的可持续发展问题解决方案。	The SDSN mobilizes scientific and technical expertise from academia, civil society, and the private sector in support of sustainable-development problem solving at local, national, and global scales.
我们可以接受他们犯一些错误，但是这他们有责任从这场80年来最严重的金融危机中学习，而非不管不顾地继续执行那些已被明确证明是错误的方针。	We accept that they will not always be right. However, it is surely incumbent on them to learn from the biggest financial meltdown of the last 80 years, rather than to press on, regardless, with policy approaches that so signally failed.
与此同时，我建议在您的旧电脑上安装微软补丁（ http : / /office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA100444731033.aspx ） ， 从而将麻烦减少到最低限度。	In the meantime, I recommend installing the Microsoft patch to your old computer ( http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA100444731033.aspx ) and just suffering the devil you know.
财政政策自2010年以来基本上就被废止了，因为萧条带来的二战后规模最大的巨额赤字和急剧上升的负债/GDP比率把各国政府吓得不敢动弹。	Fiscal policy has been effectively disabled since 2010, as the slump saddled governments with unprecedented postwar deficits and steeply rising debt-to-GDP ratios.

在此前的经济衰退期，特别是在发展中经济体，通常只有富人才能享受到最高水平的医疗服务，而穷人则通常除了孤军奋战没有其他选择。	During past recessions, especially in developing economies, the best care has tended to go to the wealthy; the poor, too often, have been left to fend for themselves.
21世纪初“点com”大崩盘后，房地产和金融资产投机 — — 拜廉价资金所赐 — — 维持了西方经济体的增长。	Following the dot-com collapse of the early 2000’s, speculation in real estate and financial assets – enabled by cheap money – kept Western economies going.
将非成员国纳入可能会影响到东盟的团结；但如果东盟成员国决定严格坚守共识决策原则，这是一个必须接受的权衡。	Including non-member countries could undermine ASEAN’s unity; but that is a tradeoff ASEAN member states will have to accept if they decide to adhere strictly to consensus decision-making.

事实上，2002—2014年间巴西GDP增长中只有10%可归因于全要素生产率改善，而三分之二是教育程度比以往略高的工人进入劳动力市场带来的结果。	Indeed, only 10% of Brazil’s GDP growth in 2002-2014 can be attributed to total factor productivity gains, while two-thirds was the result of an increase in slightly better-educated workers entering the labor force.
尽管特朗普大肆抨击的北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）可能只会对美国贸易和就业产生非常温和的影响，但他试图羞辱墨西哥，要墨西哥人为他的边境筑墙计划买单，好像墨西哥是美国的殖民地似的。	Although the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump reviles, has likely had only modest effects on US trade and jobs, he has attempted to humiliate Mexicans insisting that they pay for his border wall, as if Mexico were a US colony.
他甚至称气候变化是一个“骗局 ” ， 是中国人的发明，并以破坏美国制造业竞争力为目标（虽然他后来收回了这一指控 ） 。	He once even called climate change a “hoax,” invented by the Chinese to make US manufacturing less competitive (though he later walked back that accusation).
但日本当前的艰苦来自日元兑其他主要货币的升值 — — 去年升值幅度达到了24 % ， 并导致日本股市也随之下跌。	But Japan’s current travails, which have brought a concomitant decline in Japan’s stock market, stem from the yen’s appreciation – 24% over the last year – against major currencies.
欧洲有理由担忧，并且现在不得不面对一个现实，即欧盟不仅仅是一个共同市场，一个经济共同体，它也是一个全球行动者，一个团结的、拥有共同价值和安全利益的政治单元。	Europeans have reason to be worried, and they now have to face the fact that the EU is not just a common market – a mere economic community – but a global player, a cohesive political unit with shared values and common security interests.

更好的方法是将移民从脆弱的农村地区引导到具备必要条件、能够吸收他们的中型城市周边；而这反过来又能防止大城市不可持续地增长。	A better approach is to steer migrants from vulnerable rural areas to nearby medium-size cities equipped with the necessary services to absorb them; this, in turn, will prevent megacities from growing unsustainably.
许多国家 — — 包括哥伦比亚、利比里亚、墨西哥和沙特 — — 在某种程度上将改善《营商环境报告》和《全球竞争力报告 》 （ Global Competitiveness Report，世界经济论坛的项目）排名作为政策目标之一。	Many countries – including Colombia, Liberia, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia – have at some point made improvement in the Doing Business ranking, or that of the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, a policy goal.
最后，也是更值得推敲的一项，就是美国在将金融变成一件更有效外交政策工具方面的努力影响到了对巴黎银行的判罚。	Finally, and more speculatively, the United States’ effort to make finance a more efficacious foreign-policy tool could have affected its treatment of BNP.
欧盟各国政府一直想要一个圆滑的委员会，但是现在的代价就是保护欧盟不受民族摩擦的“共同体方式”的灭亡。	EU governments have wanted a pliable Commission, but now the cost could be the death of the “community method” that protects the EU against national frictions.
总统巴沙尔·阿萨德及其亲信，为保护通往伊朗的生命线而战斗的什叶派武装团体、对后阿萨德时期生活忧心忡忡的宗教少数派人士，以及最难对付的伊朗及其在黎巴嫩的代理真主党则处在战线的另一端。	Against them are arrayed President Bashar al-Assad and his cronies, Shia militant groups fighting to protect their lifelines to Iran, religious minorities concerned about life after Assad, and, most ominously, Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah.

2014年石油价格冲击给一些非洲经济体造成了非常严重的影响，也让总体增长率从2004—2014年间的5—6%下降到2015—2017年的2.5 % — —这一增长率还赶不上人口增长率。	The 2014 oil-price shock hit several African economies especially hard, and played a role in pushing aggregate growth down from 5-6% in 2004-2014 to just 2.5% in 2015-2017 – a rate that barely keeps up with population growth.
一些圣战者的言论清楚地表明了这一联系 ： “ 治疗抑郁的良方就是圣战 ， ” 一名西方应征者在伊斯兰国视频中如是说。	Some of the jihadis’ statements make the connection explicitly: “The cure for depression is jihad,” one Western recruit declares in an Islamic State video.
一个是依靠集中性的直接研究支持机制，比如美国国立卫生研究院和美国国家科学基金会；另一个是通过例如税收抵免等方式来实现直接资助的分散化；或者由政府机构，私人基金会或研究机构来成功创新（或其他创意活动）颁发奖金奖品。	Another is to decentralize direct funding through, say, tax credits. Or a governmental body, private foundation, or research institution can award prizes for successful innovations (or other creative activity).

檀香山—有一项正在进行中的犬儒主义运动，宣扬在物种保护中使用一种叫做“基因驱动器”的强大但问题重重的新技术。	HONOLULU – A cynical move is underway to promote a new, powerful, and troubling technology known as “gene drives” for use in conservation.
2003年伊拉克战争爆发以来的中东混乱已经持续了十五年，给了世界一个无可争议的教训：白宫、中央情报局、摩萨德和沙特情报机构中没有一个人看到了该地区接下来会发生什么的线索。	Fifteen years of Middle East chaos unleashed by the 2003 Iraq war have taught the world one indisputable lesson: nobody in the White House, the CIA, Mossad, or the Saudi intelligence services has a clue as to what might happen next in the region.
目前还有待观察的是，从2007年6月开始控制加沙地带的哈马斯会不会支持这一由其死对头、阿巴斯领导的位于约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦权力机构提出的动议。	What remains to be seen is whether Hamas, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since June 2007, will eventually support this initiative by its bitter rival, Abbas’s West Bank-based Palestinian Authority.
法国、德国和英国都将是2019—2020年联合国安理会理事国 — — 法国和英国是常任理事国，德国是非常任理事国 — — 这一事实让它们之间的合作更加重要。	The fact that France, Germany, and the UK will all be members of the UN Security Council for the 2019-2020 period – France and the UK as permanent members, and Germany as an elected member – will add heft to cooperative action among them.
这样，最有赚钱潜力的目标就对准了夺取最多人生命的疾病，因为在这个领域，突破性的新药才能对全球健康做出最大影响。	The most potentially lucrative targets would become the diseases that kill the most people, because that is where a breakthrough drug would have the biggest impact on global health.
比方说，美国政府可以发行更多诸如长期通货膨胀保值债券的金融工具，从而使中国能够把其手中持有的部分美国政府债券转换成与之类似，但更为安全的资产。	For example, the US government should offer more financial instruments like Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), thereby allowing China to convert some of its holdings of US government securities into similar but safer assets.
带着这样的概念，由多家数字金融公司组成的绿色金融协会（Green Digital Finance Alliance）在今年的瑞士达沃斯世界经济论坛年会上宣布成立。	With this in mind, a coalition of digital-finance companies, the Green Digital Finance Alliance, was launched at this year’s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
自二战以来，军事考虑极少被纳入日本的政策，官方发展援助 — — 一开始是战备 — — 也将国际任务置于国内考虑之上。	Since World War II, military considerations have barely factored into Japanese policy, and official development assistance, which began as war reparations, has placed international imperatives above domestic concerns.
有的产品不披露其含糖酒精成分，而有的产品的这类添加剂含量如此之高，几乎肯定会带来腹泻和胀气的副作用。	Some do not disclose their content of sugar alcohols, and some have so much of these additives that they are almost certain to produce laxative effects or gas.
世卫组织预测扩大使用PrEP可以在今后十年男同性性行为群体中减少高达25%的艾滋病毒感染（该群体囊括了所有高风险个体，而不只是已经明确的男同性恋 ） 。	The WHO estimates that increased use of PrEP could reduce HIV infections by up to 25% over the next decade among men who have sex with men (this category includes anyone with elevated risk, not just those who identify as gay).
在后萨达姆时代，我们继续推进这一努力，通过实施与周边邻国建立信任的举措来抵消来自地区以外的煽动因素。	We have continued to pursue these initiatives in the post-Saddam era, engaging in confidence-building measures with our immediate neighbors in order to offset extra-regional agitations.
伦敦国王学院国际激进化研究中心（ICSR）的希拉兹·马赫（Shiraz Maher）发现这些达伊莎新兵之间有一个共同点 ： “ 义愤、反抗、感到受到迫害，拒绝妥协 ” 。	Shiraz Maher of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization (ICSR) at King’s College London identifies a common thread of sentiment among recruits: “righteous indignation, defiance, a sense of persecution, and a refusal to conform.”
但让该地区免于更多灾难性暴力需要政府回归基础，引入包容性政治程序，结束让国家受到制裁的暴力，确保程序正义，解决社会经济不公。	But averting further catastrophic violence in the region will require that governments go back to basics, introduce inclusive political processes, end state-sanctioned violence, ensure due process, and address socioeconomic injustices.
在2006年，对美国人、英国人和法国人表示不信任的伊拉克人比例达到了90 % 。 伊拉克人对邻国的态度也十分紧张。	By 2006, distrust of Americans, British, and French had reached 90%, and attitudes toward Iraq’s neighbors were also tense.
而各大国际证券交易所对这些可能无法在国内吸引足够外国机构投资者的大型新兴市场公司（包括国有企业）仍然感兴趣。	International stock exchanges remain of interest to large emerging-market companies, including SOEs, which may be unable to attract sufficient foreign institutional investors at home.
对这种态度的批评可以归结为一个简单的问题 ： “ 对我的社会福利，谁有比我更好的条件作出选择呢 ？ ”	The criticisms of this attitude boil down to a simple question: “Who is better equipped than I am to make choices about my welfare?”
一个奇怪的同盟者群体 — — “零工”雇主、劳动组织、风险投资家和两党智库 — — 不久前发表了一封信，呼吁要在上述条件下建立稳定灵活的安全网络。	A group of strange bedfellows – “gig” employers, labor organizations, venture capitalists, and bipartisan think tanks – recently issued a letter calling for a stable and flexible safety net based on these conditions.
“欧猪五国”的麻烦不仅在于公共赤字过大、负债率过高（在这方面5个国家程度有所不同 ） ， 还在于对外收支赤字、竞争力丧失和增长乏力。	Within the PIIGS, the problems are not just excessive public deficits and debt ratios (in different degrees and measures in the five countries). They are also problems of external deficits, loss of competitiveness, and thus of anemic growth.
过去十年中，政界和商界人士为维持现状，阻挠民主和经济的进一步改革，使墨西哥的发展偏离了方向。 而与此同时，其他新兴市场则纷纷崛起。	Over the past ten years, political and economic actors intent on preserving the status quo have blocked further democratic change and economic reform, condemning Mexico to move sideways, even as other emerging markets surge ahead.
极低的通胀锦上添花 — — 让盯住通胀目标的美联储有充足的空间尝试非常规政策而不会给通胀敏感的债券市场带来负面利率后果。	Exceptionally low inflation was the icing on the cake – providing the inflation-targeting Fed with plenty of leeway to experiment with unconventional policies while avoiding adverse interest-rate consequences in the inflation-sensitive bond market.
诺贝尔经济学奖获得者克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）对于他所谓的“信心仙女”嗤之以鼻。 “信心仙女”是指财政政策必须领导对债券市场的支持的观点。	The Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman has poured scorn on what he calls the “confidence fairy,” the claim that fiscal policy must command the support of the bond markets.
最后还有人质疑梅格拉希是否就是空难的真正制造者，而这可能对麦克阿斯基尔的决定有点影响（但这问题还是留给法庭判定比较好 ） 。	Finally, some question whether Megrahi really was the perpetrator of the crime, and this may have played a role in MacAskill’s decision (although, if so, that would have been better left to the courts to resolve).
尼泊尔冲突的代价之一是当地治理的倒退，以及一个80%以上人口生活在农村地区的极度贫困的国家的发展停滞。	One cost of the conflict has been the retreat of local governance and arrested development in a desperately poor country where over 80% of the population lives in rural districts.
不久之后，一个职业杀手谋杀了墨西哥最高级别的联邦警察官员埃德加·米兰·戈麦斯（Edgar Milan Gomez ） 。	Soon after, a hit man murdered Edgar Milan Gomez, Mexico’s highest-ranking Federal police official.

其次，短期资本流通常加强而不是削弱了人民币的生孩子压力，因为投机者在中国渐进的升值态度的指引下，都在赌人民币会升值。	Second, short-term capital flows usually would strengthen rather than weaken upward pressure on the RMB’s exchange rate, because speculators, persuaded by China’s gradual approach to revaluation, bet on appreciation.
所有人都不愿挑战美国的金融霸权，或者放弃特朗普对近5，000家德国企业提出的总额高达6，000亿美元的减税计划。	All were unwilling to challenge US financial might or to forfeit the tax cuts Trump had delivered to almost 5,000 German companies with a combined balance sheet of $600 billion.

这是一个关于大胆决断和企业精神的动人故事，其中包括诸多全球商学院学生都在学习研究的创新举措 — — 例如在人口稀少的地区建立分销中心以及建立全球供应链。	It is a stirring tale of audacity and enterprise, which included innovations – such as establishing distribution centers in sparsely populated regions and building up global supply chains – that business students worldwide now study.
11月，以色列对加沙采取了军事行动，哈马斯对此以牙还牙，其火箭打到了特拉维夫和耶路撒冷附近，这表明它将坚定不移地捍卫其核心价值。	Hamas’s forceful response to Israel’s military operation in Gaza in November, which included landing rockets near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, demonstrated its commitment to its core value of steadfastness.
中俄关系的经济元素 — — 在这里双方关系真正地得到考验 — — 也不令人满意，至少从中国方面的观点来看如此。	The economic components of the Sino-Russian relationship – where real attachments are tested – are also dissatisfactory, at least from China’s point of view.
从很多方面看，左翼联盟是一个极端政党，其经济政策观点常常被认为强硬偏左；但该党对债务和紧缩的看法被欧洲和美国的许多如假包换的主流经济学家所支持。	Syriza is in many ways a radical party, and its views on economic policy are often described as hard left; but the party's take on debt and austerity is supported by many perfectly mainstream economists in Europe and America.
工资保险的倡议者辩论说，培训如果由想让员工完成某一工作的雇主来进行，情况会好得多，因为雇主了解到底员工需要学习什么。	Far better, proponents of wage insurance argue, for the training to be carried out by an employer who wants a job done and knows what the employee needs to learn.
20世纪的60、70和80年代，一个信念将倍受良知谴责的欧洲人联系在一起，那就是终有一天，他们的国家将在统一的欧洲大地上站稳脚跟。	What united prisoners of conscience in the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's was the faith that one day their countries would find their place in a united Europe.

美国的年度通胀率从2008年7月的5.6%降到当年12月的0.1 % 。 欧洲则从2008年7月的4.4%降至2009年1月的2.2 % 。	In the US, the annual inflation rate fell from 5.6% in July 2008 to 0.1% in December 2008, and in Europe from 4.4% in July 2008 to 2.2% in January 2009.
欧洲领导人应该向美国表明自己愿意建立一个钢铁生产商自愿出口限制组织，而不是张牙舞爪地挥舞着即将加征关税的一长串产品清单。	Instead of blustering and showing off long lists of products on which the EU will now impose tariffs, European leaders should signal to the US that they are willing to organize a VER for their steel producers.
事实上，尽管进行了一些调整，IMF和世界银行的治理结构仍然更多地体现了过去的现实，特别是欧洲的影响力畸高。	In fact, notwithstanding a few tweaks, the governance structure of the IMF and the World Bank remained more reflective of past realities, with Europe, in particular, maintaining disproportionate influence.
Con la derrota de Hitler, una vez más pasó a ser parte de la esfera rusa, esta vez de los soviéticos.	With Hitler’s defeat, it once again became part of the Russian sphere, this time of Soviet Russia.
因此对一些国家来说，把债务重组以及长期的债务货币化（也就是不能逆向转化的量化宽松）相结合是无法比避免且恰当的。	Some combination of debt restructuring and permanent debt monetization (quantitative easing that is never reversed) will in some countries be unavoidable and appropriate.
事实上，政府的主要经济工作委员会中央经济工作委员会已经得出结论在经过数年的“高增长和低通胀”后，中国正在走向“高通胀下的高增长 ” 。	Indeed, the government’s key economic committee, the Central Work Committee, has concluded that after years of “high growth and low inflation,” China is on a route to “high growth with high inflation.”
事实上，这些数字 — — 不管如何令人震惊 — — 并没有体现一胎政策所带来的人道灾难和严重的经济后果。	Indeed, these figures – however shocking – do not capture the human suffering or the harsh economic consequences brought about by the one-child policy.
班加罗尔—在资源有限的情况下，人力资本决定了一个社区的可持续发展，特别是在资源配置不当和利用不足代价高昂的情况下 — — 发展中国家往往如此。	BENGALURU – When resources are limited, it is human capital that defines the sustainable development of a community, especially in the case of costly misallocation and underutilization, as is often the case in developing countries.
政府原先保证通过低息贷款分配石油收入，但是，随着经济形势从前途光明变得危机重重，政府被迫对燃油实行配给制度。	Instead of distributing oil revenues through a program of low-cost loans, as promised, the government has been forced to ration gasoline, as economic promise has given way to crisis.
如果继续宽松货币 — — 比如降低银行准备金要求 — — 重组就可能失去动力；新增流动性也不一定必然会流向实体部门。	If it loosens monetary policy further – by, say, cutting banks’ reserve requirement ratio – the momentum for restructuring could be lost; and there is no guarantee that the additional liquidity would flow into the real sector.
他们明白，如果瑞典货币政策由只关注通货膨胀（而对金融稳定性的关注不足）的央行来制定，失业率就会上升。	They understood that unemployment would rise if the country’s monetary policy were set by a central bank that focused single-mindedly on inflation (and also that there would be insufficient attention to financial stability).
此次选举竞争的展开方式标志着欧洲 — — 事实上，是世界 — — 历史上第一个跨国政治空间出现的一小步，但这一小步意义重大。	The way the election campaign has unfolded marks a small but significant step in the emergence of the first transnational political space in European – indeed, world – history.

根据无党派立场的国会预算办公室的数据，6月通过的美国参议院改革立法将在未来二十年中带来近1万亿美元的财政收益。	According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the US Senate’s reform legislation, passed in June, would result in fiscal benefits worth almost $1 trillion over the next two decades.
有证据表明，在发生金融危机的情况下，如果政策无效 — — 比如因为名义利率已经位于零区间 — — 赤字支出可以起到不同寻常的稳定效果。	There is evidence that in the wake of a financial crisis, when monetary policy becomes ineffective – for example, because nominal interest rates are at the zero bound – deficit spending can have an unusually strong stabilizing impact.
在生活中的几乎每一个方面 — — 道德、礼节、性行为、家庭结构、职业和宗教信仰 — — 我们西方人都拥有随心所欲的自由。	In nearly every aspect of our lives – morals, manners, sexuality, family structure, careers, and religious beliefs – we Westerners are essentially free to do as we like.
这些变革破坏了人们参与知情理性讨论的能力，更遑论说与那些持有不同观点，价值观或经济利益的人进行辩论的能力。	These developments undermine people’s capacity to engage in informed, rational discussions, let alone debates, with those who have different perspectives, values, or economic interests.
一种已经提出的选择是成立单一的超级监管者，类似于20世纪90年代亚洲金融危机后成立的韩国金融监督委员会。	One option that has been proposed would be to create a single super-regulator, like the Financial Supervisory Committee that was established in South Korea after the 1990s Asian financial crisis.
巴勒斯坦人具有强烈的民族认同感，他们宣布他们具有明确一致的目标，那就是结束以色列的占领并建立一个独立民主的国家。	With a strong sense of national identity, Palestinians boasted that they had a clear unifying purpose: ending the Israeli occupation and establishing an independent and democratic state.
前述两大营养箴言给了食品行业自私的理由：既然一卡是一卡，那么任何食物都可以成为均衡膳食的组成部分；如果吃啥变啥，那么人人选择自己吃什么。	These two nutritional maxims give credence to the food industry’s self-serving corollaries: If a calorie is a calorie, then any food can be part of a balanced diet; and, if we are what we eat, then everyone chooses what they eat.
另一方面，如果卡斯特罗真的没有前来，那么一些ALBA国家，包括两个哥伦比亚希望改善关系的邻国（厄瓜多尔和委内瑞拉）可能也不会来了。	If, on the other hand, Castro did not attend, some of the ALBA members, including two neighbors with which Colombia hopes to improve relations – Ecuador and Venezuela – might not show up, either.
据中央统计局（Central Bureau of Statistics）2015年的一份调查，93%的以色列犹太人表示信任军方，而只有40%表示信任政府，更只有22%表示信任以色列政治党派。	In a 2015 survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, 93% of Israeli Jews expressed trust in the army, compared to only 40% in the government, and only 22% in Israeli political parties.
在赢家通吃的经济中，开发出更好的在线狗粮购买和递送网站的创新者可能把全世界所有用互联网订购狗粮的用户都吸引过去，在此过程中赚取大笔利润。	In our winner-takes-all economy, an innovator who develops a better Web site for online dog-food purchases and deliveries may attract everyone around the world who uses the Internet to order dog food, making enormous profits in the process.
即便如此，运作独立性的丧失 — — 在不受干扰的情况下为实现其与政治当局协商后制定的既定目标而采取行动的能力 — — 对中央银行信誉的打击也是致命的。	Nonetheless, the loss of operational independence – the ability to act without interference in pursuit of its stated objectives, developed in consultation with political authorities – can also be fatal to a central bank’s credibility.
虽然该国在消除贫困和极度不平等方面还有很长的路要走，但在持续GDP增长方面却是世界上最强劲且表现最为平稳的国家之一。	Though the country had a long way to go to eradicate poverty and extreme inequality, when it came to steady GDP growth, it was among the world’s strongest and most consistent performers.
目前，欧洲一体化大体上是一个“掉向前 ” （ falling forward）的过程，每一次跌倒都会成为形成更坚固的联盟的教训。	So far, European integration has largely been a process of “falling forward,” with each stumble serving as a lesson from which a stronger union emerges.
但是，投资教育和研究加上强大的社会保障制度可以造就生产效率更高、竞争力更强的经济，而所有人更有保障，生活水准更高。	But investments in education and research, together with a strong social safety net, can lead to a more productive and competitive economy, with more security and higher living standards for all.
要是希腊在2010年就违约，如同现在一样对私人债权人实行扣减，它可能已经把债务和GDP的比率降低到更易于管理的80%了。	Had Greece defaulted on its debt in 2010, imposing the same “haircut” on private creditors as it has imposed now, it would have reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio to a more manageable 80%.
但在去年的未遂军事政变后，埃尔多安政权授权给自己没收由被控同情所谓的居伦运动（Gülenist movement）的人所拥有的企业。 埃尔多安指控居伦运动策划了政变。	But, after last year’s botched military coup, the regime has empowered itself to seize businesses owned by those accused of sympathizing with the so-called Gülenist movement, which Erdoğan accuses of having masterminded the coup attempt.
首先，尽管英国政治生活以言辞激烈著称，但执政联盟的出现则昭示了与之低调共存的另一股暗流：在绝大多数重要议题中，各主要党派都出现了向中间路线靠拢的趋势。	For one thing, the coalition exposes an undercurrent in British political life that has coexisted – almost furtively – with heated rhetoric: convergence among the main parties towards a kind of centrist synthesis on most of the big issues.
虽然以色列、美国与伊朗之间不大可能出现直接的军事冲突，但很明显谈判和制裁不能促使伊朗领导人放弃发展核武器。	While an outright military conflict between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other side remains unlikely, it is clear that negotiations and sanctions will not induce Iran’s leaders to abandon efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
得出的结论是不应该 — — 2007年至2008年的信贷危机发生后，这一决定似乎一直就是一个根本性的错误。	The answer was no – a decision that, in the wake of the 2007-2008 credit crisis, appears to have been a fundamental mistake.
后来的核电站从工作机理到规章制度都与福岛有了巨大的不同，养护标准和建设过程每一步的质量要求都有了极大的提高。	Its successors are radically different in how they work, as is the regulatory framework, which sets astonishing new benchmarks for the care and quality required at every stage of the process.
在任何体力至关重要的运动中 — — 例如跑步，跳远，游泳，举重以及投掷类运动 — — 印度就是不合格。	In everything where simple human prowess is at stake – running, jumping, swimming, lifting, throwing - Indians simply don’t have what it takes.
当一个著名的犹太学者感谢他为培养天主教-犹太教关系所作的努力时，他回答 ： “ 那不是我，是神意眷顾 ， ” 随后，带着他独特的笑容，加了一句 ， “ 还有我 。 ”	When a distinguished Jewish scholar thanked him for what he had done to cultivate Catholic-Jewish relations, he replied: “That was not me, that was Providence,” and then added with his inimitable smile: “And me.”
结果，在格鲁吉亚被分裂后，俄罗斯任何新的对原苏联国家的即使是建立非正式的宗主国地位的努力，都有可能遭到中国的抵制。	As a result, any more Russian efforts to establish even informal suzerainty over the Soviet successor states are, following the dismemberment of Georgia, likely to meet Chinese resistance.
基于这些趋势 — — 并假设一个持续的劳动参与率 — — 中国在未来10年的潜在增长率将在6.9~7.6之间波动，平均为7.27 % 。	Based on these trends – and assuming a constant labor-participation rate – China’s potential growth rate over the next decade is likely to hover around 6.9-7.6%, averaging 7.27%.
简单想一想：特朗普要么在椭圆办公室里 — — 现在那里装上了黄金做的窗帘；要么在他的海湖庄园里 — — 那里有角楼，有卫兵看守的大门，还有一个雄伟壮丽的带罩的床。	Just think about it: Trump spends his time either in the Oval Office, which is now decorated with gold drapes; or at his Mar-a-Lago resort, which has a turret, guarded gates, and a princely, canopied bed.
印度公众和该国因分裂而臭名昭著的政治阶层对这一消息倍感自豪，一直赞扬早就应当采取这样果断的军事行动。	The Indian public and the country’s notoriously fractious political class reacted with great pride to the news, unanimously hailing the decisive action as long overdue.

比如，一项耗时12年、观察了19 000名美国白人女性的研究发现，与心脏病具有统计关系的101遗传标记没有预测价值。	For example, a 12-year study of 19,000 white American women found that 101 genetic markers that had been statistically linked to heart disease had no predictive value.
发自纽黑文 — — 据华盛顿邮报/沙尔学院7月11日发布的美国民意调查显示，只有39％的受访者认可美国总统唐纳德特朗普对外国征收关税，而56％的受访者则表示反对。	NEW HAVEN – According to a Washington Post/Schar School poll of Americans published on July 11, only 39% of respondents approved of US President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on foreign countries, while 56% were opposed.
但卢梭在另一个意义上仍然是正确的：政策不可能在缺乏政治的情况下发生，而养活未来城市的最大挑战依然在于那些财富过度集中所催生的问题。	But Rousseau is still right in another sense: policies cannot happen without politics, and the greatest challenge to feeding tomorrow’s cities lies in the problems that concentrated wealth creates.
除更好地激励研究人员和资金捐助机构，还需要根本转变科学文化来加速科学进步，这方面有几项充满希望的计划正在开展中。	Beyond better incentives for researchers and donors, a fundamental shift in the culture of science is needed to accelerate scientific progress, and several promising initiatives are underway.
库马尔是在最高法院前回应全印人民人权和社会正义阵线（All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front，一家非政府组织）要求政府寻求要回这颗被镶在英国皇冠上的著名钻石的上诉时说这番话的。	Kumar was responding before the Supreme Court to a suit filed by the All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front, an NGO, demanding that the government seek the return of the famed diamond, which can be found among Britain’s crown jewels.
尽管德国大学清除了大屠杀的否认者，俄国大学里却仍然雇佣了若干俄罗斯史教授，他们从不在讲课时提到古拉格。	While Holocaust deniers have been purged from German universities, Russian universities employ a number of professors of Russian history who conspicuously maintain the Gulag's absence from their lectures.
妇女暴露在高风险烹饪、取暖和照明方式所产生的烟尘中，这导致了每年近200万人丧命，其中85%是妇女和儿童，死因为与此相关的癌症、呼吸道感染和肺病。	Exposure to smoke from hazardous methods of cooking, heating, and lighting kills nearly two million people each year, 85% of whom are women and children who die from associated cancer, respiratory infections, and lung disease.
此外，类似思维混乱/古怪这些目前尚未被定义为失调，但有逐渐发展成精神性失调风险的行为将被定义为“精神风险性失调 ” 。	Likewise, loose or quirky thinking that is not now a disorder but indicates an increased risk of developing a psychotic disorder would be classified as a “psychotic risk disorder.”
处死某人，哪怕是杀人犯都是令人恐慌的，但是，某些极度不快的行动对于防止更坏的、夺取无辜受害者性命的行为是必要的。	It is very disturbing to take someone’s life, even a murderer’s life, but sometimes highly unpleasant actions are necessary to prevent even worse behavior that takes the lives of innocent victims.

法庭的决定在欧洲大陆引起了反响 — — 不只罗姆人，还有所有在民主欧洲里倡导宽容、平等价值观的人们。	Its decision reverberates across the Continent – not just for the Roma, but for all who have a stake in promoting the values of tolerance and equality in a democratic Europe.
如果持有者如今认定反对置换能令自己更可能在延长时间的情况下全额收回债务，那么就更加难以对主权债务进行重组并令债务国经济重回正轨。	If creditors now believe that holding out makes it more likely that they will receive full value at a later date, restructuring sovereign debt and restoring a debtor economy’s normal functioning will be more difficult.
作为回应，葛兰素史克对其网站上使用帕罗西汀的18岁以下患者进行调查后，发表了一份详尽的临床案例研究报告。	In response, GlaxoSmithKline made full-trial reports of all studies involving paroxetine in patients under 18 available on their website.
但在现代社会早期，随着1492年穆斯林被赶出西班牙、后来又被赶出其他殖民帝国控制的国家，迁徙又有了后来与圣战相关的更为暴力的含义。	In early modernity, however, with the systematic expulsion of Muslims from Spain in 1492, and later from lands seized by other colonial empires, hijra acquired a more violent meaning that anticipated its later association with jihad.
尽管去年8月欧洲央行通过承诺购买无限量短期政府债务稳定了市场，但激活欧洲央行的“直接货币交易”计划必须以持续财政紧缩为条件。	Although its pledge last August to purchase unlimited quantities of short-term government debt has calmed markets, activation of the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” program is conditional on continued fiscal retrenchment.
当无党派的国会研究局（Congressional Research Service，CRS）报告共和党税收计划不能提振经济增长时，共和党参议员们强迫CRS收回报告。	When the non-partisan Congressional Research Service reported that a Republican tax plan would do nothing to foster economic growth, Republican Senators muscled the CRS into withdrawing its report.

然而在曲折离奇的情节之外 ， 《 蜗居》其实真实地再现了当今中国社会的背后推动力：房产，金钱，性，车和权力。	As fantastic and convoluted as the plot sometimes gets, “Wo Ju” offers a truthful look at what animates contemporary Chinese society: property, money, sex, cars, and power.
正像国际移民组织在兰佩杜萨悲剧发生后不久所指出的那样，加强边境控制“从长期看既不会显著影响也不会减少南欧移民的数量。	As the International Organization for Migration stated shortly after the Lampedusa tragedy, implementation of enhanced border controls “did not have sufficient impact or decrease the number of arrivals to the South of Europe in the long run.
该公司最近发布了一篇长篇辩护博文，作为对其所谓联合国秘书长潘基文的气候变化特使玛丽·罗宾逊（Mary Robinson ） “ 声嘶力竭地鼓吹”远离化石燃料的反应。	The company recently published a long, defensive blog post responding to what it described as a “full-throated endorsement” of fossil-fuel divestment by Mary Robinson, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s special envoy for climate change.

这里的矛盾之处在于这场危机向中美两国展示了一个达成协议的特殊机会。 这个协议将为达成全球性的气候协议奠定基础。	The paradox here is that the crisis presents a unique opportunity for the United States and China to strike a deal that would lay the groundwork for a global climate agreement.
在瑞典被称为“嫖娼法”的法律规定下，付钱买性可以通过罚款或高达六个月的监禁加以处罚，还要加上向公众曝光作为羞辱。	Under Sweden’s so-called “Sex Purchase Law,” paying for sex is punishable by fines or up to six months in prison, plus the humiliation of public exposure.

十五年前我在amplt;amplt;历史的终结和最后一个人ampgt;ampgt;一书中论述到，如果社会想要现代化，除了市场经济和民主政治体制之外就别无选择。	Fifteen years ago in my book The End of History and the Last Man I argued that, if a society wanted to be modern, there was no alternative to a market economy and a democratic political system.
类似的药方 — — 以及包括大幅通胀的药方 — — 颇有市场，以往内对付经济停滞的常规手段已经试过并宣告失败。	Prescriptions like these – as with those for a jolt of inflation – have gained ground because the obvious solutions to economic stagnation have been tried and failed.

在我们于2005年发表首先定义了未来11国的论文《金砖四国成色如何？ 》时，我经常开玩笑说之所以选择了11这个数是因为它代表着一支足球队的场上球员人数。	Around the time that we published the 2005 paper “How Solid are the BRICs?”, in which we first identified the N-11, I often joked that we chose 11 simply because it was the number of players on a soccer team.
事实上，卡梅隆在讲话中明确承认了这一点，因此包含针对英国“新方案”的新条约可能需要与所有成员国单独协商。	Indeed, Cameron recognized this explicitly in his speech, so the new treaty to embody a “new settlement” for Britain may have to be negotiated with all member states as a separate exercise.
当中国，美国，印尼、巴西和其它全球势力都各自发出一种统一的声音之时，欧洲却已经无法承受自己内部那些不和谐的杂音了。	With China, India, the US, Indonesia, Brazil, and other major global players speaking with one voice, Europe could no longer afford a cacophony of voices.
自奥托·冯·俾斯麦当政以后的欧洲政府以及富兰克林·罗斯福以后的美国政府以来一直都奉行现收现付（pay-as-you-go）的退休金制度。	European governments since Otto von Bismarck and US governments since Franklin Roosevelt have therefore maintained pay-as-you-go (PAYG) retirement pension systems.
美国和欧盟（它们对库尔德人独立的概念反应都相当冷静）的一个选择是支持或参与库尔德斯坦地区政府（KRG）和伊拉克政府在巴格达的谈判。	One option for the US and the European Union (which has been similarly cool to the idea of Kurdish independence) would be to support or participate in negotiations between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Iraqi government in Baghdad.
一开始，你不知道这只是一个错误的音符，是某个掉落下来、在最终静止之前的短暂翻滚时发出的声音，还是一个真正的错误，一个刺耳的干扰，一场真正危机的前兆。	One never knows, at first, whether it is just a false note, the sound of things falling and continuing to roll briefly before finally coming to a stop, or a real clunker, a more jarring interruption, the herald of a real crisis.
美国财政部长小摩根索（Henry Morgenthau, Jr . ） 在1945年的著作《德国是我们的问题 》 （ Germany is Our Problem）中指出，摩根索计划的目的是将德国转变为“以农业和牧业为主”的国家，以此防止它参与新战争。	The plan’s aim – articulated by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr., in his 1945 book Germany is Our Problem – was to convert Germany into a “principally agricultural and pastoral” country, in order to prevent its involvement in any new wars.

不管从哪个方向上看，从特朗普的贸易战到俄罗斯和摩尔多瓦准备阻止英国在退欧后进入世界贸易组织，现实不可避免地要与退欧派的英国重要性幻想发生正面碰撞。	And wherever one looks, from Trump’s trade wars to Russia and Moldova vowing to block Britain’s post-Brexit accession to the World Trade Organization, reality is ineluctably crushing Brexiteers’ fantasies of English importance.
约翰内斯堡 - - 美国最高法院上周裁决，关塔纳摩湾的被拘押人员具有人身保护权，也就是他们有权在法院对其关押的事实和法律基础提出质疑。	JOHANNESBURG – Last week, the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantánamo Bay have the right to habeas corpus – the right to challenge the factual and legal basis of their detention in a court of law.
而且，因为国民阵线无法组成联盟，所以即便法国已经过渡到三足鼎立的政治制度，但权力仍然掌握在左翼和右翼主流政党的手中。	And, given the National Front’s inability to make alliances, power has remained in the hands of the main parties of the left and the right, even as France has moved toward a tripartite political system.
对此的解释包括政府干预或一种 新型的工业组织，及新的制造者们对专利的侵犯。 他们仿制他国产品并阻断进口产品参与国内的市场竞争。	Such explanations included government intervention or a new sort of industrial organization, and unfair patent infringements by the new producers who copied products and then blocked off their own markets from import competition.

北欧国家是非常民主的社会，所以它们知道除非能让大多数劳动者将全球化视为有利因素，否则就无法持续下去。	The Nordic countries are deeply democratic societies, so they knew that unless most workers regarded globalization as benefiting them, it wouldn’t be sustained.
这个理念在小布什执政后期已经提出，目的是为了和某些东盟成员国构建联系 — — 比如新加坡，越南和文莱 — — 同时也涵盖其他太平洋国家。	This was proposed late in the Bush administration in order to forge links with some ASEAN members – Singapore, Vietnam, and Brunei – as well as others across the Pacific.
随着时间不断推移，私人和国有部门之间界限的逐渐模糊将削弱后者获取 — — 及滥用 — — 银行融资渠道的优势，令到企业债券的市场不断扩张。	Blurring the line between the private and the state-owned sectors would, over time, reduce the latter’s privileged access to – and overuse of – bank financing, leading to the expansion of corporate bond markets.

尽管中美关系的第四阶段并非冷战（因为双方存在非常高的相互依存关系 ） ， 但也要比典型的贸易纠纷（如美国最近就进入加拿大奶制品市场问题与加拿大产生的冲突）对立得多。	While this fourth phase of the relationship is not a cold war, owing to the high degree of interdependence, it is much more than a typical trade dispute like, say, America’s recent clash with Canada over access to that country’s dairy market.
但如果移民治理不负责任、缺少合作，这些好处就很容易被挥霍浪费，我们在地中海、安达曼海、中美洲走廊、萨赫勒和非洲之角所看到的危机就是如此。	But these benefits are easily squandered if, as we’ve seen recently with crises in the Mediterranean Sea, the Andaman Sea, the Central American corridor, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa, migration is not governed responsibly and cooperatively.
在不抛弃逻辑和道德的前提下 — — 自由世界秩序恰恰是在这些领域继续胜过替代选项 — — 自由主义者必须与民众建立感情。	Without disregarding logic and ethics – areas where the liberal world order continues to outshine the alternative – liberals must connect with people on an emotional level.
这一精巧结构（出资之外还有很多机构）在20世纪八九十年代被拼凑起来。 亚洲金融危机前，它就好比是一张中央没有蜘蛛的蛛网。	This elaborate architecture (and there is a lot more) was assembled piecemeal in the 1980s and 1990s.
关键问题不在于所有权形式（国有还是民营 ） ， 而在于必须保证这些企业根据市场原则在竞争环境下经营。	The key problem is less the form of ownership (state or private) than it is the need to ensure that these enterprises operate according to market principles and within a competitive environment.

事实上，国际社会在等待叙利亚一盘散沙的反对派自己形成一股团结、有效的力量，正如反对派在等待国际社会的行动一样。	In fact, the international community is waiting for Syria’s disorganized opposition to transform itself into a coherent, effective force as much as the opposition is waiting for the international community.
土耳其的官僚、政治家和公民团结一致，努力达到针对欧盟成员的哥本哈根标准，并一起承受着IMF指导下的结构调整计划所带来的阵痛。	Turkey’s bureaucrats, politicians, and citizens united to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership and tolerated the pain of the IMF-directed structural-adjustment programs.
如果这两个国家的相互敌视得不到遏制，原教旨主义的阿富汗继续为巴基斯坦提供威胁其不共戴天仇敌印度所需要的战略纵深，那么目前这场灾难可能仍然会造成失败的结局。	If these two countries’ mutual hostility is not reined in, and a fundamentalist Afghanistan continues to provide the strategic depth through which Pakistan threatens its sworn Indian enemies, the current disaster might still breed defeat.
但是，对于像我这样的老记者而言，却有一种强烈的似曾相识感 — — 这种控制让我想起了1990年前这里的无党派绝对君主制，那时每天的任务就是自我审查。	But, for older journalists like me, there is a strong sense of déjà vu—the controls hark back to the times of the partyless absolute monarchy that existed here before 1990, when self-censorship was the order of the day.
当然，人们可以把普世人权的概念最早追溯到十七世纪英国自然法思想。 1789年的法国人权宣言部分地包含了这一概念。	It is, of course, possible to trace the concept of universal rights at least as far back as seventeenth-century English thinking about natural law.
美国1944年的《军人转业安置法案》之所以成功，因为它为那些最需要培训的人提供了支持，让归国二战老兵顺利融入生产性经济。	In the US, the 1944 Servicemen’s Readjustment Act (better known as the GI Bill) was a success because it provided training for those most in need of it, enabling returning World War II veterans to re-enter the productive economy.
美国从吉米·卡特任期后半段和罗纳德·里根任期内开始认识到需要寻找新的增长源，并对产业和金融部门实施了去监管化，与此同时，撒切尔夫人在英国也采取了相似的动作。	Recognizing the need to find new sources of growth, towards the end of Jimmy Carter’s presidency, and then under Ronald Reagan, the United States deregulated industry and the financial sector, as did Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.
另外，总理默克尔可能会领导一个少数派政府 — — 这也是德意志联邦共和国近70年历史以来的第一次 — — 它将不得不将所有政策提案都提交议会辩论，并冒着有被封锁的风险。	Alternatively, Chancellor Angela Merkel could lead a minority government – the first in the Federal Republic’s nearly 70-year history – which would have to submit every policy proposal for parliamentary debate, with the risk of being blocked.
中国也在防着印度，印度的人口规模很快会超过中国，并逐渐成为一个经济和战略竞争对手 — — 更何况两国之间还存在边界争议。	China, too, is wary of India, which will soon surpass it in population size and is emerging as an economic and strategic competitor – one with which it shares a disputed border.
随着对德隆寺的控制卷入了敌对的法律诉讼中，驻扎于新德里的噶玛巴无疑会认为最近缴获的现金彻底“揭露”了他那由中国选定的对手。	With control of the Rumtek monastery embroiled in rival lawsuits, the New Delhi-based Karmapa has, not surprisingly, greeted the recent cash seizure as “exposing” his Chinese-appointed rival.
阻止喜马拉雅山区环境剧烈破坏已是当务之急，而要实现这一目标，唯有通过喜马拉雅地区 — — 从下湄公河地区和中国到南亚各国 — — 所有成员的通力合作。	Halting rampant environmental degradation in the Himalayas is now urgent, and it is possible only through cooperation among all members of the Himalayan basin community, from the lower Mekong River region and China to the countries of southern Asia.
20世纪90年代末，泰国和韩国所爆发的经济危机掀起了一波潮流，鼓吹所谓盎格鲁—萨克森经济模式的优越性。	The response to the economic crisis in Thailand and Korea in the late 1990’s was emphatic preaching about the inherent superiority of the so-called Anglo-Saxon economic model.
如今，四十多亿人拥有智能手机、平板电脑和电视，可以通过这些设备享用曾经绝对是帝王专属的按需定制的娱乐服务。	Today, more than four billion people with smartphones, tablets, and televisions enjoy a form of on-demand entertainment that was once reserved for absolute monarchs.
但如果我们用地理学来隔离外生性的贸易决定因素，贸易很显然就成为创造亚洲经济成就的最强大驱动力之一，也因此成为发达世界和发展中世界之间差距的弥合因素。	But, if one uses geography to isolate exogenous determinants of trade, it becomes apparent that trade has been among the most powerful drivers of Asia’s economic success, and thus the convergence between the developed and developing worlds.
在巴拉克·奥巴马总统治下，美国由无人机发起的攻击数量猛增，仅巴基斯坦一地报告的无人机攻击就超过300次之多。	Under President Barack Obama, the number of drone strikes carried out by the United States has soared, with more than 300 UAV attacks reported in Pakistan alone.
尽管普京表示准备授权采取针对可疑恐怖分子的打击 ， “ 不管他们身在何处 ” ， 但恐怖袭击仍在继续发生。	The attacks have continued, despite Putin’s stated willingness to authorize strikes against suspected terrorists, “wherever they may be.”
因此，中国持续的经济增长取决于减少政府对生产资本的占有，促进市场创新和增长，以及投资人力资本（如通过教育、卫生和社会福利 ） 。	Given this, China’s continued economic success depends on reducing state ownership of productive capital, facilitating market innovation and growth, and investing in human capital, such as through education, health care, and social welfare.
传统的俄国军队无法有效对抗恐怖主义，因为他们不仅轻视士兵的小组作战能力，也不鼓励指挥员发挥个人能动性。	Russia's traditional army cannot fight terrorists effectively because it disdains the ability of soldiers to work in small groups, and does not encourage individual initiative on the part of officers.
但是，要想打破暴力和不安全的循环，所有国家最终都需要采取措施改善水管理和保护生态系统、否则，它们的水危机 — — 以及内部动荡 — — 只会愈演愈烈。	But, in order to break the cycle of violence and insecurity, all countries will ultimately have to step up to improve water management and protect ecosystems. Otherwise, their water woes – along with internal unrest – will only worsen.
如今她及Cataphora公司正将类似的分析应用于一个完全不同的市场：那些希望分析自己的电子邮件往来（以及其他文本）并了解他人与自己互动时作何反应的人。	Now she, and Cataphora, are applying those same analytics to a different market: people who want to analyze their own e-mail correspondence (and eventually other content) to see a reflection of their interactions with others.
美国为实现要求的预算进程改革，应当在劝说安理会其他常任理事国在该进程中赋予联合国大会更大的作用上起主导作用。	To achieve the reforms of the budget process that it wants, the US will need to lead the way in persuading the other permanent members of the Council to give the General Assembly a greater role in the process.
其次，我所依赖的经济增长和金融深化之间的相关性在国家金融体系超越银行、电子转账和债券市场范畴、包括了复杂工具时确实消失了。	Second, the correlations between economic growth and financial deepening on which I relied do indeed vanish when countries’ financial systems move beyond banks, electronic funds transfer, and bond markets to more sophisticated instruments.
相反，卡帕尔多的框架缺少部门和国家细节，其行为假设非常模糊；其极端凯恩斯主义假设也与其中期视角不太“搭调 ” 。	By contrast, the Capaldo framework lacks sectoral and country detail; its behavioral assumptions remain opaque; and its extreme Keynesian assumptions sit uneasily with its medium-term perspective.
减少妇女花在无薪看护工作上的时间的最有效的方法之一是扩大育儿服务供给，形式可以是政府补贴、雇主支持和自筹。	One of the most effective ways to reduce the amount of time women spend on unpaid care work is expanding the provision of childcare, whether government-subsidized, employer-assisted, or self-funded.
尽管存在质疑者，但对亚投行的普遍支持表明收益大于风险，并且中国的措施有助于构建一个向所有人开放的网络。	While there are skeptics, broad support for the AIIB suggests that the benefits outweigh the risks, and that China’s initiatives may help build a network that is open to everyone.
当今中国是重商主义衣钵的主要继承者，尽管中国领导人永远都不会承认这一点 — — 这个名词仍背负着很多坏名声。	Today’s China is the leading bearer of the mercantilist torch, though Chinese leaders would never admit it – too much opprobrium still attaches to the term.
所有这些都因为欧洲和美国之间紧张局面的升级而变得更加复杂。 欧盟和美国之间的紧张局面已经影响到遏制中国的合作。	All of this is complicated by escalating tensions between Europe and the United States, which, among other things, is spoiling cooperation to contain China.
欧盟委员会宣称，如此放缓反映了高主权违约风险而不是财政整合，这一观点已经被英国证明是错误的 — — 市场认为该国的主权风险可以忽略不计。	The European Commission’s claim that this slowdown reflects high sovereign-default risk, rather than fiscal consolidation, is belied by the UK, where the sovereign risk is deemed by markets to be virtually nonexistent.
地中海地区特有的、令人叹为观止的自然资源本是其最大的财富 — — 每年都会吸引超过2亿游客涌向上述地区，为地区经济输送营养。	The Mediterranean region’s unique, breathtaking natural capital is one of its greatest assets – the reason why more than 200 million tourists flock to the region each year, feeding the region’s economy.
随着大数据、机器学习和“物联网”的崛起，有些专家预测到2035年，互联网的连接数量可能会增长到近一万亿。	With big data, machine learning, and the “Internet of Things,” some experts anticipate that the number of Internet connections may grow to nearly a trillion by 2035.
在我们的书《火烧白宫 》 （ White House Burning）中，郭庾信（James Kwak）和我强调财政可持续性不仅对经济繁荣很重要，对国家安全也很重要。	In our book White House Burning, James Kwak and I emphasized that fiscal sustainability is important not just for economic prosperity but also for national security.
Aogra执行董事帕特里克·格雷琴（Patrick Graichen）指出，世界能源未来供应的预测大多没有考虑到太阳能战胜化石燃料竞争者的情景。 这一情景已经出现在我们面前。	As Patrick Graichen, Agora’s executive director, points out, most forecasts of the world’s future energy supply fail to take into account solar power’s looming victory over its fossil-fuel competitors.
但由此造成的争议可以解决，政治上的敌意也是可以化解的。 具体实现方式就是通过致力于实现广大的共同利益的多边机构进行监督。	But the resulting controversies can be resolved, and the political venom neutralized, through surveillance by multilateral institutions that are committed to achieving an overarching good.
扩张性货币政策 — — 安倍经济学所谓三支“箭”中次于财政刺激的第二支 — — 令失业率只有3.8 % 。	Expansionary monetary policy – the second of three so-called “arrows” of Abenomics, after fiscal stimulus – has brought down the unemployment rate to just 3.8%.
只要一触及到引力无限大这一点，整个理论都变得站不住脚：但笔者桌面的众多教科书却集体失明，无一提到这一硬伤。	Never mind that infinite forces are a sure sign that your theory has gone up in smoke: in the current crop of textbooks sitting on my desk, not one mentions the obvious pathology.
欧洲非法流动占人口流动总数的比例比美国高大约25 % ， 而与此同时，美国合法的人口流动比欧洲大约也高出25 % 。	Illegal flows as a proportion of the population are about 25% larger in Europe than in the US; at the same time, legal flows are roughly 25% larger in the US than in Europe.
一些美国的怀疑论派者担心苏联科学家和克格勃间谍会盗取美国技术，但是他们却并没有注意到，苏联的访客们将科学机密连同政治观念一道吸纳进去。	While some American skeptics feared that Soviet scientists and KGB agents would steal American technology, they failed to notice that the visitors vacuumed up political ideas alongside scientific secrets.
其中一些群体，如目前执政的人民党（PP ） ， 逐渐转向了中间道路，成为比较典型的保守派欧洲政党，就像英国保守党和德国基督教民主联盟。	Some, like the now-ruling People’s Party (PP), have over time shifted toward the center to become more typical conservative European parties, much like the UK’s Conservatives or Germany’s Christian Democratic Union.
美国平均寿命预期增长速度不及欧洲，部分原因在于1999年以来许多中年美国白人寿命缩短，而这是与生活方式有关的疾病、类鸦片药物使用过量和自杀造成的。	Average US life expectancy has increased more slowly than in Europe partly because many white middle-aged Americans have, since 1999, been living shorter lives, owing to lifestyle-related diseases, opioid overdoses, and suicides.
这是一项前所未有的举措，不仅是印度，在全世界几乎所有地方都是如此，其程度之激进远超莫迪迄今为止的所有政策干预。	It was an unprecedented move, whether in India or almost anywhere else, and it is by far Modi’s boldest policy intervention to date.
另一方面，在波兰和捷克共和国的导弹防御系统以及格鲁吉亚和乌克兰可能的对北约的加入，承担起在根本不必要的地方进行对抗的责任。	On the other hand, the missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic, and the prospect of NATO accession for Georgia and Ukraine, assume confrontation where this was not at all necessary.
哈马斯表达了自身的意愿，同意在接收所有难民和以色列释放所有巴勒斯坦囚犯的前提下建立一个由约旦河西岸和加沙地区组成的巴勒斯坦国。	Hamas, for its part, has expressed its willingness to accept a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza, subject to a return of all refugees and Israel’s release of all Palestinian prisoners.
哈佛大学的本·弗里德曼（Ben Friedman）在其2006年的著作《增长的道德后果 》 （ The Moral Consequences of Growth）中令人信服地指出，经济增长对开放的民主社会来说是大好事。	And, as Ben Friedman of Harvard University argued persuasively in his 2006 book The Moral Consequences of Growth, economic growth is good for open and democratic societies.
人们一度以为，由于发达国家比发展中国家拥有更多资本，所以只要提供更多的资本就能够解决发展中国家的问题。	At one time, it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries, merely supplying more capital would solve their problems.
虽然过去50年经济快速增长对支持经济发展至关重要，但我们现在已经了解增长也能带来严重的不良后果，特别是在环境领域。	While rapid economic growth, such as that realized over the past 50 years, is critical to support development, we now also know that it can have serious adverse consequences, particularly for the environment.
斯坦福大学经济学家罗伯特·霍尔（Robert Hall）三十年来一直在强调，在美国，汽车销售员比制造汽车的工人数量更多。	As Stanford University economist Robert Hall has been pointing out for three decades, more Americans are employed selling cars than making them.
但是就在刚刚过去的几周之内，逊尼派北部的部分地区已经爆发反对真主党以及他所支配的政府武装叛乱，并且公开支持叙利亚叛乱势力。	But, in just the last few weeks, parts of the Sunni north have erupted in armed defiance of Hezbollah and the government that it dominates, and are openly supporting the Syrian rebels.
凯恩斯相信应该执行激进的经济政策来对经济波动现象作出逆周期回应 — — 即在经济衰退期实施扩张政策，回升时实施紧缩政策。	Keynes is associated with a belief in activist economic policy aimed at ensuring counter-cyclical responses to economic fluctuations – expansionary policies during recessions and policy tightening during upswings.
比如，7月份亚马逊的会员日（Prime Day）卖掉了一亿多件商品，斩获42亿美元其中包括印度人买的食盐，新加坡人买的零度可乐，以及中国人买的牙刷。	For example, in July, Amazon sold more than 100 million products to consumers worldwide during its annual Prime Day event, a $4.2 billion bonanza that included sales of table salt in India, Coke Zero in Singapore, and toothbrushes in China.
俄罗斯、中国和其他国家认为这一原则在利比亚滥用了，国家法的指导思想仍应是联合国宪章，而宪章禁止在除自卫或得到安理会授权之外的情形中使用武力。	Russia, China, and others believe that the principle was misused in Libya, and that the guiding doctrine of international law remains the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force except in self-defense, or when authorized by the Security Council.
有人通过社交媒体不断散播谣言，还有一位右翼脱口秀节目主持人亚历克斯·琼斯反复指控她参与虐待儿童，还指控她的竞选主席约翰·波德斯塔参与撒旦的邪恶仪式。	The rumor spread through social media, and a right-wing talk show host named Alex Jones repeatedly stated that she was involved in child abuse and that her campaign chairman, John Podesta, took part in satanic rituals.
与法官们的斗争所激起的公众骚乱使穆巴拉克顺理成章地在开罗市中心部署了成千上万名身穿黑色警服的中央安全部队。	The battle with the judges has incited enough popular unrest to warrant Mubarak’s deployment of thousands of black-uniformed central security forces in the heart of Cairo.
新政府的方针将决定巴西是走委内瑞拉之路（如今在滞涨中泥足深陷）还是走智利之路（被广泛视为拉丁美洲最佳经济体 ） 。	Its approach will determine whether Brazil goes the way of Venezuela, which is currently mired in stagflation, or Chile, widely regarded as Latin America’s best-run economy.
他在布鲁塞尔建立了一个名为“运动（The Movement ） ” 的组织，旨在团结欧洲右翼民粹主义势力并废除当前形式的欧盟。	His organization, called “The Movement” and based in Brussels, aims to unite Europe’s right-wing populists and take down the European Union in its current form.
2012 的一项美国立法授予SEC制定众筹平台规则的任务。 这项立法规定，初创企业每年利用众筹平台筹资不得超过100万美元。	The 2012 US legislation that tasked the SEC with rulemaking for crowdfunding platforms specified that no startup can use them to raise more than $1 million a year.
本次代表大会也对近年来 — — 特别是巴勒斯坦当局成立之后 — — 不断腐蚀这个组织的滥权和腐败行为进行了整治。	The Fatah congress also dealt a blow to the abuse and corruption that have plagued the movement in recent years, especially since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority.
类似地，当中国采取措施改变地区现状时 — — 不管是领土还是领海 — — 美国也犹豫了，没有采取措施安抚紧张不安的亚洲盟友。	Likewise, as China has stepped up efforts to upend the regional status quo – both territorial and riparian – the US has dithered, doing little to reassure its jittery Asian allies.
事实上，国际能源署（International Energy Agency）预计不出几年美国就将取代沙特阿拉伯和俄罗斯成为世界第一大产油国。	Indeed, the International Energy Agency predicts that in the next few years the US will overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world’s largest oil producer.
为了达成规模和影响力相当的协定，世界领导人 — — 特别是美国和中国领导人 — — 需要类似的高压。	In order to achieve an agreement of similar scale and influence, world leaders – especially in the US and China – would need to be under similarly high pressure.
而随着经济增长加速降低了债务-GDP之比，新的增支减税计划得以实施，这进一步增加了选民对政客的爱戴。	Endearing politicians to voters further are new spending increases and tax cuts that can be undertaken, as accelerating economic growth causes the debt-to-GDP ratio to fall.
也必须足够老谋深算地认识到，只要中国继续在人民币汇率方面遭受到国际压力，那么他们当然也不会在减排上作出什么承诺。	It means being sophisticated enough to understand that as long as China feels under pressure to stop propping up the renmimbi, it is unlikely to deliver commitments on emissions cuts.
因为大会可以忽略那些大国所设立的障碍 — — 比如中国和美国在去年 12 月哥本哈根全球气候峰会上的所作所为。	Yet the General Assembly is the only place where obstruction by major countries – for example, by China and the United States at December’s global climate talks in Copenhagen – can be bypassed.
在他信以更大的优势获得连任后，他的政府遭到了颠覆，他的政党被最高法院取缔，他也被迫在因为腐败指控被判有罪后逃亡。	When he was re-elected by an even larger majority, his government was overthrown, his political party was banned by the Supreme Court, and he was forced to flee the country after corruption charges against him led to a criminal conviction.
比方说，迷恋明星的女性影迷可能特别容易相信好莱坞著名银狐的观点，或者在涉及纳粹的情况下，恐惧会使听众很容易被说服。	For example, star-struck female film fans may be especially prone to believe any utterance from Hollywood’s most famous silver fox. Or, in the case of the Nazis, fear may predispose the audience to be persuaded.
事实上，许多观察家认为，希腊与其债权人所达成的第三次援助方案协议 — — 在瓦鲁法基斯辞职不到一周时签署 — — 只不过是前两次的重复。	Indeed, many observers view the agreement on a third bailout program that Greece reached with its creditors – barely a week after Varoufakis resigned – as simply more of the same.
对主权豁免和公平对待所有债权人原则的破坏几乎已经成为常态，正如纽约法院对阿根廷债务的判决如此清晰体现的那样。	And it has become almost the norm to violate the principles of sovereign immunity and equitable treatment of creditors, evidenced so clearly in the New York court’s decision on Argentine debt.
他们发现，采采蝇的嗅觉和味觉受体基因较少，探测二氧化碳的基因较多 — — 这是它们找到吸血对象的关键。	They found that tsetse have fewer genes for olfactory and gustation receptors, and more genes for detecting carbon dioxide – key to helping them find a host.
去年，网上有一份8,000人签名的请愿，要求纽约大都会艺术博物馆撤下巴尔萨斯（Balthus）的一幅名画。 这幅画描绘了一个坐在椅子上的少女，露出了一些内衣。	Last year, an online petition with 8,000 signatures asked the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to remove a famous painting by Balthus, showing an adolescent girl sitting on a chair with a patch of her underwear showing.
任何泰米尔人认为会导致压制他们的权利和与主要民族僧伽罗族平等地位抱负的“胜利 ” ， 都会是短命的。	Any “victory” that the Tamils perceive as leading to subjugation of their rights and aspirations for equality with the majority Sinhalese will be short-lived.
环境可持续意味着我们必须改变经济和技术的方向，提供安全水源和卫生措施等基本服务，战胜人类引起的气候变化，并保护生物多样性。	And environmental sustainability means that we must reorient our economies and technologies to provide basic services like safe water and sanitation, combat human-induced climate change, and protect biodiversity.
我怀疑后一种情况将成为现实，因为在欧洲大部分地区以及美国，失业问题和公共开支的削减将使经济方面的信心难以得到提振；而这又会导致解决全球失衡这一政治任务变得愈加棘手。	I suspect the latter, with unemployment and cuts in public spending – certainly in much of Europe and the United States – constraining economic confidence. That will make the politics of dealing with global imbalances all the more difficult.
不久前法国《世界报》还刊登了一条精彩的报导：奥朗德[总统]在盎格鲁－萨克逊游说者面前捍卫法国的鹅肝 ” （ 这条新闻实际指的是加州按照禁止虐待动物法的规定禁售鹅肝的措施 ） 。	Just recently Le Monde had the wonderful headline: “[President] Hollande Defends French Foie Gras against Anglo-Saxon lobbies” (the reference was to California’s ban on foie gras under its animal-cruelty laws).
机场、新港口、物流设施、银行和跨国公司地区总部之间的协同效应创造了服务业出口和投资的发繁荣，奠定了经济高速增长的基础。	The synergies between the airport, the new ports, the logistics facilities, banks, and the regional headquarters generated a boom in services exports and investment, underpinning rapid economic growth.
但是在这一问题上还是这样，也就是增加工人们的法律和法定权利，同时让大多数工会自生自灭似乎是一个正确的办法。	But here, too, increasing workers’ legal and statutory rights, while allowing most unions to fade away, seems like the right approach.
但是，通过重新谈判IMF协议章程（Articles of Agreement ） ， 寻求更大灵活度的美国和寻求金本位所提供的可预测性的法国成功地让IMF起死回生。	But, by renegotiating the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, the US, seeking greater flexibility, and France, which sought the kind of predictability that the gold standard had provided, were able to revive it.
放眼未来，欧元升值（另一个令人惊奇之处，特别是对许多不到两年前还在担心欧元生存的观察者来说）将在一定程度上抑制欧元区的经常项目盈余。	Looking ahead, the appreciating euro (another surprise, especially to the many observers who doubted its survival less than two years ago) will compress the eurozone’s current-account surplus to some extent.
综艺节目是法国特色，堪与面包、奶酪和葡萄酒相提并论，但这并没有加强这位支持率已然低得离谱的总统的尊严和信誉。	Vaudeville may be a French specialty, like bread, cheese, and wine, but it does not strengthen the dignity and credibility of an already spectacularly unpopular presidency.
首先，RCB应该承担起预测通货膨胀的任务，规划稳定物价的政策，实施这些政策或说明为什么它不能实施这些政策以及谁可以。	As a starting point, the RCB should be charged with projecting inflation, formulate policies to stabilize prices, and either implement those polices or explain why it cannot and who could do so.
此外，难民患者得到能够理解他们的处境 — — 包括流离失所所造成的巨大的心理压力 — — 的医生的医治，对他们来说也大有裨益。	Moreover, refugee patients benefit when treated by doctors who understand their circumstances, including the enormous psychosocial stress that displacement causes.
比如，主宰媒体界的鲁珀特·默多克（Rupert Murdoch）需要欧盟单一市场成员地位来整合他旗下的英国、德国和意大利卫星电视公司。	For example, Rupert Murdoch, whose outlets dominate the media landscape, needs membership in the EU single market to consolidate his satellite TV businesses in Britain, Germany, and Italy.
特别是，在印度，巴基斯坦军方 — — 尽管其规模名列世界第六，但它能够打赢与其巨人邻邦的传统战争的希望渺茫 — — 利用其恐怖主义代理人挑起了一场秘密战争。	In India, in particular, the Pakistani military – which, despite being the world’s sixth largest, would have little chance of winning a conventional war against its giant neighbor – uses its terrorist proxies to wage a clandestine war.
虽然整个贸易系统无疑都是为西方列强的利益服务的，但没有了非洲统治精英的大力配合，这个系统是不可能存在的。	It was a system that no doubt worked to the benefit of Africa’s partners. But it would not have existed without the active and willing participation of African elites.
比如，奥地利钢铁生产商奥钢联（Voestalpine AG）会先在美国生产钢珠，然后在澳大利亚加工成高质量合金制品。	The Austrian steel producer Voestalpine AG, for example, will start producing steel pellets in the southern US that will then be upgraded to high-quality alloys in Austria.
从2009年到2013年，世界银行私人部门贷款机构国际金融公司（International Finance Corporation）所作出的投资承诺增长了73 % 。	From 2009 to 2013, new investment commitments by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s private-sector lending arm, have risen 73%.
许多与会者都同意应该将经济学研究构建在更宏大的政治背景上，更着重于体制所扮演的角色，也应该教学生懂得谦卑。	Many conference participants agreed that the study of economics should be set in a broader political context, with greater emphasis on the role of institutions. Students should also be taught some humility.
这些因素削弱了发达经济体的实际和未来潜力，边缘化了大部分人口，削弱了企业和专家的信誉，并助长了愤怒型政治。	These factors have undercut advanced economies’ actual and future potential, alienated significant segments of the population, eroded the credibility of the establishment and expert opinion, and fueled the politics of anger.
这些势头发展非常缓慢，很难成为报纸的头条，但它们合在一起却为农业和农村发展领域的公共和私人投资提供了更为诱人的回报。	These trends move too slowly to make headlines, but cumulatively they offer a whole new world of bigger payoffs from public and private investment in agriculture and rural development.
它们也把关键领域，包括教育、基本医疗和提高农业生产率等方面的投资作为重中之重，为自立的繁荣未来打下基础。	And they are placing a high priority on investments in critical areas, including education, basic health care, and increased agricultural productivity – the building blocks of a self-sufficient and prosperous future.
偶尔当我们的基金组织被专制政府驱逐出境时¾就像白俄罗斯和乌兹别克斯坦曾经发生的那样¾我们就在境外继续开展行动。	Occasionally, when a repressive regime expels our foundation – as happened in Belarus and Uzbekistan – we operate from the outside.
那些拥有本国货币的国家，像英国 — — 尤其是美国，可以向国外借入美元 — — 不需要面对直接融资限制。	Countries that have their own currency, like the United Kingdom – and especially the United States, which can borrow from foreigners in dollars – do not face a direct financing constraint.
可以肯定，美国刑事调查人员还没有正式确定阿齐兹的动机，这名年轻人在科威特出生，似乎并不属于任何恐怖组织。	To be sure, US criminal investigators have not officially identified the motives of the Kuwaiti-born Abdulazeez, who does not seem to have belonged to a terror network.
当尼日利亚总统奥卢塞贡·奥巴桑乔1月13日出人意料地宣布开始全国性探讨宪法改革的对话时，他终于接受了无可避免的现实。	When Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo made his surprise announcement on 13 January to begin a nationwide dialogue to discuss constitutional reform, he was bowing to the inevitable.
在这一情形中，一小撮人将成为巨富 — — 在绝大多数情况下，不是因为他们比其他所有人都更聪明或是工作更努力，而是因为根本性经济力量反复无��地进行着收入再分配。	In this scenario, a tiny minority becomes super-rich – not, for the most part, because they are smarter or work harder than everyone else, but because fundamental economic forces capriciously redistribute incomes.
而随着数字技术和即时通信技术的出现，过去五十年发生的第三次工业革命已经压缩了时间和空间，并且联通了地球。	And with the advent of digital technology and instant telecommunications, the Third Industrial Revolution, playing out over the past five decades, has connected the planet and shrunk time and space.
伦敦—20世纪90年代中期，当我出任英国银行监督部门主管时，我的朋友们觉得这不是一个光荣或令人激动的差事。	LONDON – When I became the head of banking supervision in the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s, my friends did not see it as a glamorous or exciting career move.
实行改革使该国经济稳定增长的Mikulas Dzurinda被Robert Fico取代。 后者是一个左派，他与Meciar和一个新纳粹政党建立了联盟，同时也是令人担忧的民粹主义思想的拥趸者。	Mikulas Dzurinda, whose reforms provided the country with growth and economic stability, was replaced by Robert Fico, a leftist who, having forged an alliance with Meciar and a neo-fascist party, has also adopted a worrisomely populist tone.
他的追随者们大多是文盲、赤贫者和巴格达及以远地贫民窟里最暴力的什叶派分子。 他的“救世主民兵 ” （ Mahdi militia）在2004年曾对战美军，甚至就在美国人保护什叶派免受逊尼派进攻者袭击的时候。	His followers are the largely illiterate, poorest, and most violent Shias of the slums of Baghdad and beyond, whose “Mahdi militia” fought American troops in 2004, even while the Americans were protecting Shias from Sunni attackers.
对面临政治不确定性和社会动荡的国家来说，私密货币提供了很有吸引力的资本出逃机制，加剧了保持国内金融稳定的困难。	For countries subject to political uncertainty or social unrest, cryptocurrencies offer an attractive mechanism of capital flight, exacerbating the difficulties of maintaining domestic financial stability.
这项政策大概只能影响1000万对夫妻 — — 对于人口超过13亿的中国来说，这个数字只是九牛一毛 — — 但它代表了迈向结束独生子女规则的巨大一步。	While this will affect only around 10 million couples – a small number in a country of more than 1.3 billion people – the reform represents a gigantic step toward ending the one-child rule.
为了达成这个目的，G20的领导人设立了具有宏大抱负的议程，来对问题制定具有包容性和范围广泛的应对措施。	With this in mind, the G-20 leaders set out an ambitious agenda for an inclusive and wide-ranging response.
此外，它继续在沿着从中东到中国海岸的“不稳定之弧”的海运通道上的每个关键点建立军事基地的“珍珠链 ” 。	Moreover, it continues to build its “ string of pearls” of military bases at every key point on maritime transportation routes along the “arc of instability” from the Middle East to China’s coast.
报告提出两个方案，一是增加六个新常任理事国，如印度、巴西、埃及、南非、日本和德国，以及三个两年制临时成员国。	The report proposes two alternatives. One would add six new permanent members – such as India, Brazil, Egypt, South Africa, Japan, and Germany – as well as three two-year members.
随着经济的扩张，亚洲国家有了构建和拔高新历史的信心，它们要么淡化自身的侵略行为，要么抬高它们面对残酷牺牲时的坚定不移。	As their economies have expanded, Asian countries have gained the confidence to construct and exalt a new past, in which they either downplay their own aggressions or highlight their steadfastness in the face of brutal victimization.
这一事件在几位法国作家（及很多法国-阿尔及利亚博客写手）中造成了不小的轰动，他们站出来保护达乌德，对萨拉菲派和旨在迫使他陷入沉默的学者对他的攻击行为持批评态度。	The episode created such a commotion in France that several authors – as well as many Franco-Algerian bloggers – came to Daoud’s defense, criticizing the attacks against him by Salafists and academics intent on bullying him into silence.
但最新证据表明，我们并没有采取行动，国际能源署的《2011年世界能源报告》显示，二氧化碳排放量再次创出新高。	Yet the latest evidence demonstrates that we are not acting – the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Report 2011 reveals that CO2 emissions have rebounded to a record high.
斯密认为，政府有责任 “ [ 修建和维护]特定公共工程和特定公共机构，对于任何个人或小团体的利益而言，上述基础设施他们永远也不可能修建和维护 ” 。	According to Smith, the government has the duty to “[erect and maintain] certain public works and certain public institutions, which it can never be for the interest of any individual, or small number of individuals, to erect and maintain.”
在这个意义上说，俄罗斯既是叙利亚的老大（和伊朗一样）又是阿萨德政权的人质 — — 而且只能由美国来解救。	In this sense, Russia is both a master of Syria (along with Iran) and a hostage of the Assad regime – one who can be freed only by the US.
与此同时，收入的增加 — — 发展项目的目标 — — 几乎总是意味着增加自然资源和能源的消费，导致更多排放和进一步变暖。	Meanwhile, rising incomes – a goal of any development effort – nearly always means increased consumption of natural resources and energy, resulting in more emissions and further warming.
她被宋思明所承诺的捷径所诱惑，以委身于他的代价换取一大笔钱和一套奢华公寓，没过多久她还怀孕了，由此可见，宋思明也深谙“抓老鼠”之道。	She is tempted by the shortcut Song promises and allows herself to be seduced by him in turn for a large sum of cash and luxury apartment. Soon she is even pregnant.
叙利亚内战爆发已届四年，虽然战争带来了可怕的人道主义后果，但制止暴力的国际外交活动却没有取得任何进步。	Four years after the outbreak of the country’s civil war, and despite the horrific humanitarian consequences of the fighting, international diplomacy to stop the violence has achieved nothing.
他同时接过了中国共产党总书记和中央军委主席两职，与前几任相比，他有更大的机会在掌权伊始就实行自己的政策。	By immediately taking the reins of both the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Central Military Commission, he has a greater opportunity to put his personal stamp on policy than his predecessors had at the start of their administrations.
总理巴达维担心触发种族冲突而宣布禁止在公开场合讨论这些问题，并且威胁，如果互联网新闻供应者以及活动分子继续煽动此类的辩论的话，就将逮捕他们。	Concerned about sparking an ethnic clash, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has proclaimed a ban on open discussion of these issues, threatening to arrest Internet news providers and activists if they continue to fan such debates.
所有这些因素的三个可能结果包括相对稳定的多速世界、破坏美国经济复苏的大扰动，以及得益于美国增长的欧洲复兴。	The three possible outcomes of all this include a relatively stable multi-speed world, notable disruptions that undermine the US’s economic recovery, and a European revival that benefits from US growth.
2012年出现了两大意外。 一是新兴市场增长速度放缓，情况比预想中稍差且波及范围更广；二是欧洲采取了一些意义重大的改革—虽然远不及实际所需。	The two main surprises were the slowdown in emerging markets, which was slightly sharper and more widespread than anticipated, and Europe’s embrace of some truly remarkable reforms – though still far short of what is needed.
多年来，中国利用其扼住几乎所有亚洲主要跨国水系的优势，操纵河流流向，如今，中国又把持上游数据，以此向下游国家施压，特别是印度。	After years of using its chokehold on almost every major transnational river system in Asia to manipulate water flows themselves, China is now withholding data on upstream flows to put pressure on downstream countries, particularly India.
那些被分开关押的儿童“怪异地令人想起二战期间针对美籍和非美籍日裔民众的拘留营，现在人们普遍认为上述事件是美国历史上最大的耻辱 。 ”	The images of separated children were, she argued, “eerily reminiscent of the internment camps for US citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history.”
为了接受政治控制，成为中国殖民地的国家的政府被迫采用这种图画文字系统，但是，这些字符的读音没有受到中国的控制。	Governments in countries colonized by China were forced to adopt this pictographic writing system in order to receive political regulations, but the pronunciation of the characters was not controlled.
与此同时，在中国，30,000名工人正在试图改变天气，实施飞机人工降雨或用高射机枪发射凝结核，以期从天上“骗”点雨水下来。	Meanwhile, in China, some 30,000 workers are trying to change the weather, attempting to seed clouds from airplanes or using anti-aircraft guns to shoot shells into the air, hoping to coax some rain from the sky.
对印度过度臃肿的国有企业（包括大型煤矿钢铁企业以及亏损不断的印度航空公司）的私有化进程依然在艰难起步。	Privatization of India’s bloated public sector (from massive coal and steel enterprises to the loss-making national carrier Air India) has been slow to get off the ground.
沙特本国和泛阿拉伯媒体也加入了这一阵营，而一群网络水军迅速展开行动，奋力为沙特统治者辩解并抹黑其批评者。	Saudi-owned domestic and pan-Arab media toed the line, too, while an army of online trolls quickly set to work to defend the Kingdom’s rulers and smear its critics.
印度的上两届政府也是分别由23和30个政党组成，他们不仅完成了任期，而且在经济上还取得了不菲的成绩。	India’s last two governments each served a full term and presided over significant economic growth, even though they comprised 23 and 20 parties, respectively.
但尽管他建立更为整合且多元化的资本市场的呼吁令人钦佩，却缺乏一个可以将可持续发展融入金融体系的路线图以及应对碳泡沫的战略。	But while his call for more integrated and diversified capital markets in the EU is admirable, his proposal lacks both a roadmap for the integration of sustainable development into the financial system and a strategy for addressing the carbon bubble.
问题在于连任铁路部长视火车为穷人唯一负担得起的交通工具，不约而同地拒绝提高客运票价而代之以挤压货运。	The problem is that a succession of railway ministers, viewing the trains as poor people's only affordable means of transport, have refused to raise passenger fares, squeezing freight instead.
作为世界第六大经济体、拥有4,000万人口、堪称美国未来的化身、由团结负责的民主党政府执政的加利福尼亚州是进步联邦主义能够取得什么成就的榜样。	With the world’s sixth-largest economy, a population of nearly 40 million that looks like the future of America, and a united and responsible Democratic government, California is a model of what progressive federalism can accomplish.
更重要的是，当前的局面反映了政治和宗教领袖缺乏智慧、责任和基本尊重，他们更喜欢助推而不是消弭宗派冲突。	More important, the current situation reflects a lack of wisdom, responsibility, and basic decency on the part of political and religious leaders, who prefer to fuel, rather than dampen, inter-communal strife.
但尽管在2015年和2016年巴尔干国家确实已成了寻求庇护者从叙利亚逃往德国和瑞典的“高速公路 ” ， 但在土耳其同意收留难民以换取欧盟金融援助后，这条路径事实上已经关闭。	But while the Balkans did become a highway for asylum seekers fleeing Syria for Germany and Sweden in 2015 and 2016, that route was effectively closed down when Turkey agreed to host refugees in exchange for EU financial aid.
在最新预算中，联邦政府2010年用于Medicare计划的支出预计将超过5000亿美元，而Medicaid则将耗费纳税人2500亿美元。	In the most recent budget, the federal government’s outlays for Medicare in 2010 are projected to be over $500 billion, while Medicaid will cost taxpayers over $250 billion.
法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙、英国首相特雷莎·梅和德国总理安格拉·默克尔在说服特朗普承认联合全面行动计划方面的可耻失败是可以预见的。	The humiliating failure of French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to convince Trump to remain in the JCPOA was predictable.
地方官员和管理者都有很多的理由不去服从发改委的指令。 有些人希望进一步扩充产能，好让自己的企业不再位列“低效率”的名单之内 — — 但这种把戏是明令禁止的。	Local officials and managers had a variety of reasons for not complying with the NDRC’s order. Some expected to expand their plants so that they would no longer be counted as inefficient – a stratagem explicitly prohibited by the regulations.
在乌克兰国内每天发生的压制人民权利，压制媒体言论，对商界的敲诈勒索都表明在欧洲的边界上存在着一个黑手党国家。	The everyday oppression, stifled media, and shakedowns and extortion of businesses for bribes all point to a mafia state on Europe’s border.
伦敦 — — 现在正是世界各地上市公司一年一度的股东大会季（AGM ） ， 而且，和往年一样，高管的薪酬问题导致公司新闻从商业栏目转到了头版头条。	LONDON – It’s annual general meeting (AGM) season for public companies around the world, and, as in previous years, one issue has been moving company news from the business section to the front page: executive pay.
中国正在经历另一场领导层转换，这相对于其他大国的标准来说较为平静，因为后者的选举有时会显现出政治战争的特征。	China is moving toward another leadership transition, relatively calm by the standards of other powers, where elections sometimes take on the characteristics of political warfare.
像之前和之后很多别的人一样，我从第一刻起就被曼德拉咧着大嘴的温暖笑容、无休无止的魅力风度和他探讨自己国家过渡问题时清晰的智慧所彻底俘获。	Like so many others before and since, I was captivated from the first moment by Mandela’s huge, luminescent smile, by his unending charm and grace, and by the lucid intelligence with which he discussed his country’s transition problems.
但是，就象人们担心这种情况真的来临一样，这其实也反映了人口统计学的发展缓慢：印度的人口在过去60年里翻了三倍多，而经济增长速度却比过去快。	But, as worrying as this might appear, this actually represents a considerable demographic slowdown: India's population more than tripled during the past sixty years. Moreover, the economy is growing much faster than before.
将所有这些都纳入所谓的经常项目余额中，美国2017年外部赤字为4,500亿美元，或GDP的2.3 % 。	When all of these are included in what is known as the current-account balance, the US had an external deficit in 2017 of $450 billion, or 2.3% of GDP.
如果电动汽车行驶距离不超过50000公里（用欧洲电力 ） ， 那么其二氧化碳总排放量将高于常规汽车。	If the car is driven less than 50,000 kilometers on European electricity, it will have emitted more CO2 overall than a conventional car.
美国之所以可以一直保持入不敷出状态，是因为它可以向全世界发售美元计价债务，而这又是因为美元是世界主要储备货币。	The US has been able to live beyond its means by selling dollar-denominated debentures to the world, because the dollar is the world’s main reserve currency.
之后中国人同意在今年夏天开始进口美国牛肉，并解除多年来一直执行的多项保护主义政策，还同意对美国一系列金融服务开放市场。	After that, the Chinese agreed to start importing US beef this summer, rescinding protectionist policies that had been in place for several years. China also agreed to open its market to a range of US financial services.
中国政府也对这一安排总体感到满意，但也有一些中国经济学家一直以来都警告说对美贸易顺差并不符合中国的长远利益，主要原因如下：	China’s government, too, was generally comfortable with the arrangement, though some Chinese economists have long warned that running a trade surplus with the US was not in China’s long-term interests, for a few key reasons.
新德里—4月底，17岁的女孩克里提·特立帕提（Kriti Tripathi）在印度科塔（Kota）跳楼身亡。	NEW DELHI – In late April, a 17-year-old girl named Kriti Tripathi leaped to her death in Kota, India, shortly after passing the country’s examination for admission to the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT).
只要那些印刷“硬通货”的国家央行（比如德国）愿意向那些“软通货”同僚们提供无限度的支持，问题自然迎刃而解。	If the central bank of the country that printed its “strong currency” (Germany) had been willing to provide unlimited support to a “weak currency,” things would have been sorted out.
斯坦福 — — 俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京对叙利亚冲突的干预一直深受某些人的欢迎，认为这是克里姆林宫“摆脱孤立”的时刻。	STANFORD – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intervention in the Syrian conflict has been welcomed by some as a moment for the Kremlin to “come in from the cold.”
他们最终可能像埃及一样，埃及正在成为一个警察国家，或者走上阿尔及利亚所走的道路，25年前在与政治伊斯兰主义有过一段短暂的调情后，阿尔及利亚局势最终陷入专制镇压和多年的暴力冲突。	They could end up like Egypt, which is becoming a police state, or move in the direction taken by Algeria, where a brief flirtation with political Islam 25 years ago gave way to an authoritarian clampdown and years of violent conflict.
问题不仅仅在于甚至不主要在于国际货币基金组织拖延向阿根廷提供资金，更大的问题在于国际货币基金组织所提的建议乏善可陈。	The problem is not only, or even mainly, the IMF's delay in providing money to Argentina. The bigger problem is the paucity of correct ideas coming from the IMF.
但本来没必要如此：华沙会议提供了一次刺激对最强力地推动气候变化的行为 — — 政府对化石燃料的数十亿美元的补贴采取行动的机会。	But it does not have to be like this: The Warsaw meeting provides an opportunity to galvanize action on one of the most potent forces driving climate change – the billions of dollars spent by governments on fossil-fuel subsidies.
此外除非经济增长出现奇迹般的复苏，降低公共债务水平将变得越来越困难，使得目前的养老金政策逐渐变得无以为继。	Moreover, reducing public-debt levels will become more difficult unless there is a miraculous revival in economic growth, which current pension policies makes less likely every year.
其中包括导致儿童无法接触公共卫生专业人士的内部冲突、某些宗教领袖的反对，以及公众对国家政府和国际卫生计划持不信任态度。	They include internal conflicts that make children inaccessible to public-health professionals, opposition by some religious leaders, and public mistrust of national governments and international initiatives.
虽然俄罗斯仍勉强维持着1.5%的年增长率，但与其军事侵略相关的年度民事、法律和其他成本现在已经达到其国内生产总值的至少3~4 % ， 也就是450到600亿美元。	While Russia’s annual growth rate is stuck at an anemic 1.5%, the annual civilian, legal, and other related costs of its military aggression are now at least 3-4% of GDP – or $45-60 billion.
奥巴马政府在就任伊始就全面陷入了墨西哥禁毒战争，目前正面临着在华盛顿几乎从未触及的种种危险，人们要了解这些危险只有从墨西哥发来的外交电报中。	Obama plunged into Mexico’s drug war at the outset of his administration, and now faces perils that are barely touched upon in Washington, except in cables originating in Mexico.
类似地，尽管中国在从基于制造的经济向基于服务的经济转变方面已经取得了不少进展（2013年，服务业占GDP比重第一次超过了制造业 ） ， 但还有很长的路要走。	Likewise, though China has already made progress in moving away from manufacturing toward a service-based economy (the GDP share of services exceeded that of manufacturing for the first time in 2013), there is still a long way to go.
中共大佬们，跟日本政客 — — 或者，事实上还有黑手党教父 — — 那样，本应尽力隐藏自己的权力欲。	Chinese party bosses, like Japanese politicians – or, indeed, Mafia dons – are supposed to be discreet in their appetite for power.
如今，妇女承担了四分之三的无薪工作，贡献了大约10万亿美元的产出，或全球GDP的13 % — —其中没有一分钱转化为她们的收入，更不用说经济实力了。	Today, women undertake three-quarters of all unpaid care work, producing output of around $10 trillion, or 13% of global GDP – none of which is translated into income, let alone economic power.
特朗普在联合国发表演讲短短一周后，法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙就在索邦大学的一次演讲中描绘了他对欧洲未来的愿景。	Just a week after Trump’s UN speech, French President Emmanuel Macron presented his vision of Europe’s future in an address at the Sorbonne.
雪上加霜的是，此时有一百多万叙利亚难民涌入黎巴嫩 — — 从比例上讲相当于8000万墨西哥人突然进入到美国。	Making matters worse, more than a million Syrian refugees have poured into Lebanon – the equivalent, in proportional terms, of 80 million Mexicans suddenly arriving in the United States.
美国正在无休止地对公司提供安全保障，从商业银行到投资银行，然后是保险公司，现在是汽车行业，看来被救助的名单还远远没有完结。	America has expanded its corporate safety net in unprecedented ways, from commercial banks to investment banks, then to insurance, and now to automobiles, with no end in sight.
在未来几十年内，某些未知的 彗 星或其他天体接近这颗小行星，改变其运行轨道，使它对准地球撞过来，这种可能性并非没有。	Some unknown comet or other space object could fly near enough to the asteroid in the next few decades to change its predicted path, perhaps in a way that redirected it toward Earth.
而2008~09年间低至1.4％的平均增长率 — — 相对其更长期趋势的历史性下跌 — — 也为当前的增长数字做了极大铺垫。	This takes on added significance for a global economy that slowed to just 1.4% average growth in 2008-2009 – an unprecedented shortfall from its longer-term trend.
但是，随着鲁哈尼的胜利，伊朗向前迈进了一步；如今，它的谈判伙伴需要认识到这是至少四年来推进外交进程的最佳机会并同样向前迈出一步。	But, with his victory, Iran has taken a step forward; it is now up to its negotiating partners to recognize that this is the best chance for diplomatic progress in at least four years, and to make a similar move.
施密特鼓吹普及门罗主义（Monroe doctrine）的全球秩序：大国划定不可侵犯的地缘政治势力范围，即“大空间 ” （ Grossraum ） ， 由此实现相互尊重。	Schmitt advocates a global order that universalizes the Monroe doctrine: great nations stake out inviolable zones of geographic influence, or Grossraum, from which they afford each other mutual respect.
美国剑桥—美国财政部最近提高了对德国长期经常项目盈余的批评声音，这凸显出关于如何应对这一问题的深刻分歧。	CAMBRIDGE – When the US Treasury recently added its voice to the chorus of critics of Germany’s chronic current-account surplus, it underscored the deep disagreement over what, if anything, should be done about it.
将军、外交官、国家安全官员和发展专业人士正在形成一个共识，要沿着叙利亚的一段边界设置禁飞的“安全区 ” 。	Generals, diplomats, national-security officials, and development professionals are approaching a consensus in favor of a no-fly “safe zone” along one of Syria’s borders.
在经历了近十年的日渐疲软的军事干预后，美国在伊拉克的作战任务于2010年结束，在阿富汗的作战任务计划在2014年结束。	After nearly a decade of draining military engagement, the US combat mission in Iraq concluded in 2010, and the combat mission in Afghanistan is set to end in 2014.
另一个原因是，如果老人不死而新人继续出生，地球人口增长率将大大超过现有水平，我们的生活水平可能出现大幅下降。	Another is that if people continue to be born, while others do not die, the planet’s population will increase at an even faster rate than it is now, which will likewise make life for some much worse than it would have been otherwise.
金融救助即便是那些不值得救助的人，但如果大家都可以受益的话，还是可以接受的 — — 尽管那些金融冒险家是最大的受益者。	And that, unfortunately, is the perception held by many nowadays, particularly in the United States.
但它确实说明了由于无休止地实施经济紧缩以及政治领导在国内外的失败，欧洲民主制度在21世纪初是如何迅速被破坏的。	But it does illustrate how rapidly in early twenty-first-century Europe democracy has been undermined through the endless application of the economics of austerity, and by the failure of political leadership at home and abroad.
加沙地带大约75%的人口获得某种形式的UNRWA援助，60%的加沙一至九年级儿童在UNRWA学校就读。	Some 75% of the population of the Gaza Strip receives some form of UNRWA assistance, and 60% of Gaza’s children from first to ninth grade attend UNRWA schools.
该方案指出应该成立“欧洲安全债券 ” （ ESBies ） 。 欧洲债务机构将以各国对欧元区GDP的贡献为权重购买欧元区国家的主权债券， 并以这些债券为抵押发行两种证券。	A European debt agency would purchase eurozone countries’ sovereign bonds, weighted according to each country’s contribution to the eurozone’s GDP, and use them as collateral to issue two securities.
比如，2009年，一名叫谢尔盖·马格尼茨基（Sergei Magnitsky）的律师在揭露俄罗斯官员的退税欺诈后被控盗用公款。	In 2009, for example, Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer, was accused of embezzlement after uncovering a fraudulent tax-refund scheme run by Russian officials.
管理部门加紧了对于律师的限制以阻止共同起诉和有多个起诉人的诉讼，主要是对政府部门的专制行为和腐败行为的诉讼，并且对地方当局可以干涉和控制这些案件。	Administrative restrictions on lawyers were tightened to discourage class action or multiple plaintiff suits – typically cases against arbitrary or corrupt government actions – and to facilitate local authorities’ intervention and control over cases.
今天，阿萨德遭到人们的辱骂，内贾德政府被指责暴力镇压支持民主的抗议者，真主党和伊朗则由于继续支持阿萨德而被谴责，因为阿萨德屠杀害当地的居民。	Today, Assad is reviled, Ahmadinejad’s government is accused of violently suppressing its own pro-democracy protestors, and both Hezbollah and Iran are condemned for continuing to back Assad as he slaughters his own population.
一个很少人留意但特朗普政府似乎正在尝试运用新思维的领域是对失业工人进行再培训以及改善高中层面的职业培训。	One little-noticed area where the Trump administration seems to be trying out fresh thinking is the retraining of displaced workers and the improvement of vocational training at the high-school level.
第三个因素是外部集团—既有国家集团也有非国家集团—通过明目张胆或隔岸观火的方式支持叛乱延长伊拉克痛苦的意愿。	The third factor is the willingness of outside groups – both states and non-state groups – to prolong Iraq’s misery by supporting the insurgency, whether overtly or by inaction.
也许更重要的是要给小企业机会建立“自动注册计划 ” ， 经验表明，该计划能有效促使员工加入401k计划并保持储蓄。	Perhaps more important would be to give small businesses the opportunity to create “automatic enrollment plans,” which experience shows is very effective in getting employees to join and sustain saving in 401k plans.
因此，土耳其政府对布什政府发出的加入联军的邀请做出了快速的响应，尽管这次行动从一开始就注定不可能成功－库尔德人和美国任命的伊拉克管理委员会都明确表示反对。	So the authorities responded quickly to the Bush administration's request for Turkish troops to join the coalition, although the idea was stillborn - rejected by both the Kurds and the American-appointed Governing Council in Iraq.
但太多关于欧洲和欧元区未来的决定在极大程度上走的是技术官僚决定程序，大部分公民并不真正了解要发生什么，更不用说体会决策者所关心的东西了。	Yet too many decisions about the future of Europe and the eurozone are made in highly technocratic settings, with most citizens not really understanding what is going on, let alone feeling that policymakers care.
相反，德国最大的两个政党 — — 基督教民主联盟和社会民主党正在快速坠落，在这样的情况下，德国领导人不可能推行不受欢迎的协议。	Instead, with the popularity of the country’s two largest political parties, the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats, falling fast, Germany’s leaders are unlikely to push an unpopular deal.
显然不是所有的项目都会涌现Airbnb和Uber的惊人增长，但其中某些像Rent the Runway这样的设计师品牌服饰及饰品租赁项目可能会有利可图；而其他则根本不可行。	Clearly, not all of them will experience the astonishing growth of Airbnb and Uber. Some, like Rent the Runway for designer clothes and accessories, may find profitable niches; others will simply fail.
而凝聚了小组研究成果的新书 — — 《治愈我们分裂的社会：在克纳报告发布五十年后的调查》编辑：弗雷德·哈里斯（Fred Harris ） / 艾伦·柯蒂斯（Alan Curtis ） — —并不是一本令人愉悦的读物。	The just-published book based on our efforts, Healing Our Divided Society: Investing in America Fifty Years After the Kerner Report, edited by Fred Harris and Alan Curtis, makes for bleak reading.
欧洲地中海政策的核心目标是推进政治改革和“全面伙伴关系 ” ， 同时建设“和平稳定的共同区域”和欧洲地中海自由贸易区。	The EMP’s central goals were to advance a “comprehensive partnership” and political reform, and to create “a common area of peace and stability,” together with a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area.
但国会并未批准将雇主工资税削减50 % — —类似的削减营业税措施过去曾经受到共和党人的青睐，并在预算效益排行榜上排名居前。	But Congress failed to approve a 50% cut in employers’ payroll taxes – a business tax cut that many Republicans favored in the past and that ranks high on budgetary effectiveness.
她们向妇女受到的不平等法律待遇发起挑战，对妇女在摩洛哥社会中的角色提出新的思想，并且对长期以来一直被当作伊斯兰教义的惯例表示质疑。	They challenged the disparities in legal treatment of women, broached new ideas concerning the role of women in Moroccan society, and questioned practices that had long been understood as Islamic.
报告的衡量框架可以追踪成员组织和国家的政策实施和影响情况，它由SBN所有参与各方在IFC的支持下共同制定和一致通过。	The report’s measurement framework, designed to track the adoption and impact of policies by member organizations and states, was developed by and agreed upon by all SBN participants, with support from the IFC.
11月的大选并未改变美国政府权力平衡：奥巴马仍然是总统，共和党仍然控制着众议院，民主党仍然控制着参议院。	And November’s election did not change the balance of power anywhere in the American government: Obama remains President, the Republicans remain in control of the House of Representatives, and the Democrats control the Senate.
由此可见，受困于自身的矛盾心态以及零和博弈式的建国梦想，以色列人和巴勒斯坦人双方都不可能祈求能得到一个完美的解决方案。	Trapped in their contradictions and zero-sum national dreams, Israelis and Palestinians cannot expect a perfect solution.
关键是核不扩散审查会议的代表要共同努力为核裁军建立法治规则，并填补核不扩散条约的空白，使所有大规模杀伤性武器中最不人道的武器再无容身之地。	It is crucial that representatives at the NPT review conference work together to bring the rule of law to nuclear disarmament and close the gap in the NPT that has permitted the most inhumane of all weapons of mass destruction to continue to exist.
布鲁塞尔 — — 任何人在思考当今欧洲军事力量在全球事务中的价值、关系和重要性时都需要时刻牢记两点：我们要向哪里发展？	BRUSSELS – Anyone reflecting on the value, weight, and relevance of today’s European military forces for global affairs needs to keep two crucial questions in mind: Where do we want to go?
欧文·费雪（Irving Fisher）在1933年以先见之明发出的这一债务-通缩螺旋警告在今天引起了巨大的回响，许多国家的公共和私人债务水平处于或接近于历史最高点。	Irving Fisher’s prescient warning in 1933 about such a debt-deflation spiral resonates strongly today, given that public and private debt levels are at or near historic highs in many countries.
在过去的几年里，小报变得越来越刺探隐私，声称新闻自由不仅仅是要暴露高层的腐败和无能，而且要通过对名人不光彩私生活的曝光来撩拨读者。	Over the years, the tabloid press has become increasingly intrusive, claiming the right not just to expose corruption and incompetence in high places, but to titillate readers with scandalous revelations about the private lives of the famous.
至于剩下的95 % ， 如果能够在美国公民和其他人中均衡地分割，而非用于消费，那么，这将创造更大的幸福和机会。	The next 95% would create much more happiness and opportunity if it was divided evenly among US citizens or others than if they were to consume any portion of it.
事实上，突尼斯和埃及人民起义的灵感来源于伊朗“绿色运动 ” ， 该运动始于2009年选举后的一次大规模抗议，遭到政府残酷镇压。	In fact, the popular revolts in Tunisia and Egypt were directly inspired by Iran’s Green movement, which emerged during the massive post-election protests in 2009, before succumbing to a brutal government crackdown.
这将是一份明智的协议，因为摩尔多瓦50%的贸易额都是来自于欧盟地区，而且70%的摩尔多瓦公民以及差不多所有国内政党都是支持欧洲一体化的。	Such an agreement makes sense because more than 50% of Moldova’s trade is already with the EU, while roughly 70% of Moldova’s citizens and virtually all of its political parties support European integration.
欧洲和西方的所有议员都必须团结起来，做出明确、一致和响亮的回答，迫使西方领导人对欧洲最后一个独裁国家施加真正的压力。	Parliamentarians across Europe and the West must join their voice together in a well-defined, united and ringing declaration that forces Western leaders to apply real pressure to Europe’s last dictator.
有些国家（试想塞浦路斯、冰岛、爱尔兰、英国和美国）则利用金融机构杠杆不可持续的短期提升来资助私人部门活动，有时甚至罔顾其经济基本面。	Others (think Cyprus, Iceland, Ireland, the UK, and the US) resorted to unsustainable surges in leverage among financial institutions to fund private-sector activities, sometimes almost irrespective of underlying fundamentals.
去年7月访韩期间，中国国家主席习近平不但强调两国深刻的经济关系，还强调了两国对日本侵略史的共同观点。	During a visit to South Korea last July, President Xi Jinping highlighted not only the two countries’ deepening economic relationship, but also their shared views regarding Japan’s wartime past.
它与 消极的政教分离 形成鲜明的对照，按照萨科奇的说法，后者能做的只是“谴责和排斥 ” ， 而 积极的政教分离 却可以实现“对话 ” ， 并承认宗教的社会效益。	In contrast to negative laïcité , which according to Sarkozy “excludes and denounces,” laïcité positive invites “dialogue” and recognizes the social benefits of religion.
恰恰相反，认为中国经济过热的人列举了厂房、设备和固定资产投资的居高不下，上述投资占到了2004年国内生产总值的43 % 。	Instead, those who argue that the Chinese economy is overheating cite the high rate of investment in plant and equipment and real estate, which reached 43% of GDP in 2004.
但每一种办法都存在伦理因素，而在世卫组织的评估报告做出四年之后，解决这一医学紧急情况的伦理路线图仍然模糊不清，这非常危险。	But every fix has an ethical component, and four years after the WHO’s assessment, the ethical roadmap for addressing this medical emergency remains dangerously ill-defined.
国家转型计划同样旨在提高女性对劳动力的参与，从今天的22%提高到2030年占劳动力总量28%的比率。	The NTP also aims to increase female labor-force participation, from 22% today to 28% by 2020.
在这个过程中，我们会明白，我们投票是因为这是公民应该做的事，而我们出色完成工作是因为我们从中获得尊重和自我实现，而不仅仅是升职加薪。	In the process, we may understand that we vote because that is what citizens ought to do, and we excel at our jobs because we strive for respect and self-realization, not just a raise.
美元在20世纪20年代获得了世界货币的地位。 当时新成立的美联储开始买卖美元，建立相应的市场并增加其流动性。	The dollar originally acquired international currency status in the 1920’s, when the newly established Federal Reserve started buying and selling dollar acceptances, backstopping the market and enhancing its liquidity.
家庭正在忙于修复严重受损的资产负债表，过去四年来，经通胀调整的私人消费年平均增长率只有区区0.5 % 。	With households focused on repairing severely damaged balance sheets, inflation-adjusted private consumption has expanded at an anemic 0.5% average annual rate over the past four years.
上述进程导致两种类型的政治分裂进一步加剧：那就是围绕国家、民族或宗教因素的分裂、以及社会阶层的收入差距。	Two types of political cleavage are exacerbated in the process: an identity cleavage, revolving around nationhood, ethnicity, or religion, and an income cleavage, revolving around social class.
为了抓住其中大部分机会，世界需要精通科技的领导人 — — 不妨称之为“技术政治家 ” （ techno-politician ） ， 他们应该拥有对如何在这一不可预测的新环境中取得进步这一问题的直觉理解。	To make the most of them, the world needs technologically literate leaders – call them “techno-politicians” – who have an intuitive understanding of how to shape progress in this new, unpredictable environment.
陈把他宝贵的六年时间浪费在让他的行政部门把主要精力放在与他的反对党的争执上，而他本人则迎合民进党的极端势力并且推动他的政府不断地对台湾文化“去中国化 ” 。	Chen squandered six valuable years as his administration engaged mainly in polemics with its opposition parties while he pandered to the extreme wing of the DPP and mobilized his government to “de-Sinicize” Taiwan culture.
可如果首任主席默默无闻，那么欧盟理事会主席一职就将注定成为又一个滥竽充数的欧盟高级职位，既不被外界所看重，在布鲁塞尔之外也不为人所知。	But if its first occupant is not a household name, the presidency will be doomed as just another of the European Union’s confusing plethora of worthy senior positions that are neither valued nor understood outside Brussels.
在世界杯小组赛阶段，俄罗斯与埃及（足球排名第45位、无国界记者组织新闻自由指数排名第161位）和沙特阿拉伯（足球排名第67位，新闻自由指数排名第169位）等其他低世界排名的国家竞争。	In its World Cup group-stage matches, Russia competed against other low-ranked countries like Egypt (45th in soccer and 161st on RSF’s press freedom index) and Saudi Arabia (ranked 67th by FIFA and 169th by RSF).
然而在2006年，当以色列与真主党在黎巴嫩的冲突陷入僵局时，各成员国又忙不迭地寻求联合国维和部队的介入。	Yet in 2006, when Israel and Hezbollah fought to a stalemate in Lebanon, states were only too happy to turn to a UN peacekeeping force.
当然，一切顺利是一种奢望，因此另一种解读是当前均衡汇率将进一步下跌，反映市场对英国经济共识侧前景和未来生产率增长持悲观态度。	Of course, all things are not equal, so another interpretation is that the current equilibrium exchange rates will decline further, reflecting the market’s pessimism about the UK economy’s supply-side outlook and future productivity growth.
通过扩展我们对具商业价值的特点的认识，如抗虫性、木质、生长率和对气候变化的适应力，基因组学有助于改善树木育种和森林管理的可持续性。	By broadening our understanding of commercially valuable traits, such as insect resistance, wood quality, growth rates, and adaptation to climate change, genomics has helped to improve the sustainability of tree breeding and forest management.
新的所有权规则、有线电视、产品代言和其他商业相关因素使得中国的曼联球迷可能比英国还多，更不用说曼彻斯特了。	Thanks to new ownership rules, cable television, product endorsements, and other business-related factors, there are probably more supporters of Manchester United in China than there are in the United Kingdom, let alone in the city of Manchester.
决定欧元区凝聚力和未来增长前进的关键因素是通过补贴和带宽建立一个框架，以便让投资资本流向穷国，从而让它们补上竞争力缺口。	The eurozone’s cohesion and future growth depend critically on creating a framework – through grants and loans – for investment capital to flow to the poorer countries in order to close the competitiveness gap.
2003年夏天，欧元区的公众辩论和市场观点受到了日本长期通货紧缩和美国预期中严格制止通货膨胀措施的影响。	In the summer of 2003, public debate and market sentiment in the euro area were influenced by Japan’s protracted deflation and the expectation of a possibly severe disinflationary process in America.
但在2016年，德国执行了它收到的27,000例转移要求中的近30 % ， 也就是说，它接管了大约8,700人。	Yet in 2016, Germany implemented close to 30% of the 27,000 incoming requests it received, meaning that it took charge of about 8,700 people.
但事实却的确如此，理事会6月25-26日会议的决议当中就包含上述批准决定 — — 还有明确的提交日期。	But that is what happened, with the endorsement – complete with deliver-by date – buried in the conclusions of the Council’s June 25-26 meeting.
比尔和莎莉·科尔（Bill and Sari Kerr）指出，移民仅占美国人口的13 % ， 但贡献了26%的企业家，36%的新企业领导团队中至少有一名移民。	Bill and Sari Kerr have shown that, while immigrants represent about 13% of the US population, they account for 26% of all entrepreneurs, and about 36% of new firms have at least one immigrant in the leadership team.
2014年7月，美国联合欧盟对俄罗斯的金融、石油及天然气和国防科技行业实施制裁，以惩戒其对乌克兰顿巴斯地区的军事入侵。	In July 2014, the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia’s finance, oil and gas, and defense technologies sectors, in response to its military aggression in Ukraine’s Donbas region.
卡塔尔是卫星频道半岛电视台和教育城（Education City，位于多哈郊外的区，集中坐落着学校、大学和研究中心）的大本营。	Qatar is the home of the Al Jazeera satellite television channel and Education City, a district outside of Doha that accommodates schools, universities, and research centers.
比如，印度农民已经揭竿而起，因为前任政府通过的土地兼并法因为行政指令（但现在已经遭遇了立法抵制）带来的一系列修改而面目全非。	India’s farmers, for example, are up in arms, because the land-acquisition law passed by the previous government has been gutted through a series of amendments imposed by fiat (which are now, however, running into legislative resistance).
债权人忽略的是，随着时间的推移，紧缩的痛苦开始显现，在许多希腊人看来，这一痛苦超过了援助带来的好处。	What the creditors overlooked was that, over time, the pain of austerity began – in the minds of many Greeks – to outweigh the benefits of their assistance.
8月，巴西当局禁止了社交网络应用Secret，因为该公司就网络暴力担忧做出回应。 以色列也在考虑类似的措施。	In August, Brazilian authorities banned the social-networking app Secret after the company failed to respond to cyberbullying concerns, with Israel considering a similar move.
如今，债务让发达国家难以回归2008年前的增长率，更不用说重塑大衰退不发生情况下GDP所能达到的水平了。	Today, debt is making it difficult for developed countries to resume pre-2008 growth rates, let alone restore the levels of GDP that would have been attained if the subsequent Great Recession had not happened.
全球基金采用严格的纯技术公共卫生标准，并通过账目透明和联合出资等规定对资金接受国的服务提供情况进行问责。	The Global Fund applies rigorous, technical standards of public health, and holds recipient countries accountable – including through transparency and co-financing requirements – for delivering services.
这项战略在2000年搁浅，当时的以色列总理胡德·巴拉克（Ehud Barak）主动提出放弃几乎所有的被占领土、并承认巴勒斯坦国以换取真正的和平。	The strategy ran aground in 2000, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered to give up almost all the occupied territories and accept a Palestinian state in exchange for real peace.
与盈利性同业一样，承担这一任务的管理层和科学人才必须是可以找到的最优秀的人才，而吸引这样的人才必须提供有竞争力的薪酬。	As with any of its for-profit peers, the management and scientific talent to undertake this effort would have to be the best available, and attracting it would require competitive compensation.
双亲都必须使用至少10%的这一预算，但也可以将其中一部分暂存起来，等到孩子开始上学时再用（后者也将从父母的支持中获得巨大好处 ） 。	Both parents must use at least 10% of this budget, but they can also roll part of it over to use when their children start school (and again benefit greatly from parental support).
但爱因斯坦意识到有可能在不破坏其他解释的情况下添加一个特殊项 — — 即宇宙项 — — 并调整其数量来推测一个静态的宇宙。	But Einstein realized that it is possible to add one particular term – the cosmological term – and adjust its magnitude to predict a static universe, without spoiling any other explanation.
但这种蛋白质也与MS有关，研究者在测试时发现，奥法木单抗（Arzerra的活跃成分）有利于MS和（有可能）其他自身免疫系统缺陷病人。	But this protein is also associated with MS, and researchers found during testing that ofatumumab, which is the active ingredient in the medicine, could be of benefit to MS and possibly other autoimmune patients.
但我们还必须直面一个事实，即如果没有规模更大、效果更好、更加协作的军事措施，我们就无法打败伊斯兰国。	But we must also face up to the fact that we will not defeat ISIS without a bigger, more effective, and better coordinated military effort.
相反，它很容易就能把美国施压所激起的愤怒情绪凝聚成地区团结的动力 — — 正如20世纪70年代的德国所做的一样。	On the contrary, it will find an easy way to turn its resentment of American pressure into an issue of regional solidarity – exactly as the Germans did in the 1970’s.
工作人员会把一头可怜的动物绑在树上，事先麻醉以防止它乱动，然后自己躲进射击死角，静候着伟人开枪猎熊。	They would chain some poor beast to a tree, drug it to keep it still, and conceal themselves around the blind from which the Great Man would shoot.
但是，在Alphabet公司执行主席埃里克·施密特（Eric Schmidt）所谓的“智能时代 ” ， 传播新工具和习惯从而扩大知识是全世界人道发展的核心要素。	Still, now more than ever, in what Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt calls the “age of intelligence,” the dissemination of new tools and habits to expand knowledge is a core element of human development around the world.
当务之急是建立以e-SDR计价的债务市场，它能够吸引一些不愿卷入储备货币发行国地缘政治博弈乱战中的国家及投资者。	Another imperative would be to create an e-SDR-denominated debt market, which would appeal to countries that want to avoid getting caught in the crossfire between reserve-issuing countries.
尽管没有两党或多党轮流执政的体制那么好，但是让统一俄罗斯党演变成类似于自民党这样的党派对于俄罗斯的局面总见得要比局限于克里姆林宫的个人统治好得多。	While inferior to the open alternation of power between two or more political parties, the evolution of United Russia into something resembling the LDP would still leave Russia in a much better shape than a personal regime confined to the Kremlin.
不过这一同盟以及与中国的关系现在又出现了一个新问题。 今年中国超越美国成为世界上最大的温室气体排放国。	There is a new dimension to the alliance, however, and to the relationship with China. This year, China surpassed the US as the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
全世界互联网用户数量现已突破32亿，但在2015年底，57%的世界人口，或四十亿人，仍没有接入互联网，而许多互联网用户只使用基本的手机。	The number of Internet users worldwide now exceeds 3.2 billion, but at the end of 2015, 57% of the world’s population, or four billion people, remained offline, and many who are online use only basic cell phones.
中国缺乏透明公平的土地权益划定和分配，再加上一党领导的政治体制和臃肿的政府机构，导致了扭曲，进而滋生腐败和不公。	Opaque and unfair delineation and allocation of land rights in China, together with state monopolies and burdensome bureaucracies, create distortions that give rise to corruption and inequities.
此外，民主党人应恢复消费者金融保护局所做出的良好政绩 — — 例如规范发薪日贷款、学生贷款，汽车贷款和信用卡债务。	Moreover, Democrats should resume the good work that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has done until now – for example, regulating payday loans, student loans, auto loans, and credit card debt.
同时在这个事件中，双方的政策制定者都面临着国内反对派的压力，哪怕有一丝服软的迹象，就会遭到政敌的穷追猛打。	And, in this case, decision-makers on both sides face domestic opponents who are only too ready to pounce at the least sign of weakness.
更准确地说，困难在于解释三大全球发展趋势的合一：增长（而非停滞）猛增、通胀下降，以及真实（经通胀调整的）利率降低。	More precisely, it lies in explaining the conjunction of three major global developments: a surge in growth (not stagnation), a decline in inflation, and a reduction in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates.
发自普林斯顿 — — 随着全球贸易谈判陷入多年停滞，区域性贸易协定 — — 这条长期以来蛰伏沉睡的贸易自由化路径 — — 又迎来了春天。	PRINCETON – With global trade negotiations deadlocked for years, regional agreements – long a dormant route to trade liberalization – are back with a vengeance.
如果你发出警告说，若放任投机性价格上涨继续自由发展将引致巨大危险，那么你做得对，即使你不能证明这样的担忧有何依据。	Those who warn of grave dangers if speculative price increases are allowed to continue unimpeded are right to do so, even if they cannot prove that there is any cause for concern.
即使特朗普政府成功地提振了经济增长，从而遏制了“劳动力盈余”效应并创造了就业岗位，劳动力市场仍然难以跟进。	Even if the Trump administration manages to boost economic growth, thereby diminishing the “surplus labor” effect and generating jobs, the labor market will struggle to keep up.
目前，在美联储新主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）的领导下，政策可谓出色；但这并没有阻止特朗普公开抱怨利率升高过快。	So far, the Fed’s policies under its new chairman, Jerome Powell, have been spot on; but that hasn’t stopped Trump from publicly complaining that interest rates are rising too rapidly.
付钱刊登这则广告的是正统犹太教士Shmuel “Shmuley” Boteach，一位被戏称为“美国拉比”的颇受欢迎的媒体从业者，经营着一家名叫这个世界的以色列和“犹太价值观”宣传组织。	It was paid for by the Orthodox Rabbi Shmuel “Shmuley” Boteach, a popular media performer also known as “America’s Rabbi,” who presides over an advocacy group called This World, which promotes Israel and “Jewish values.”
例如在澳大利亚的墨尔本，规划人员正在尽一切努力到2040年实现该市树荫量翻倍，这种方法可以降低温度并减少热相关死亡。	In Melbourne, Australia, for example, planners are working to double the city’s tree canopy by 2040, an approach that will lower temperatures and reduce heat-related deaths.
欧洲音乐、文学和电影的所有重大发展都离不开我们的参与（这一点只要想想安杰伊·瓦依达在统一时代与法国联合摄制的《丹东》等电影就知道了 ） 。	We participated in all the major developments in European music, literature, and film (think of Andrzej Wajda’s films from the Solidarity era, such as “Danton,” which were French co-productions).
但饶是如此，东部联邦仍然没能摆脱空心化的命运，因为大量最有能力、最具企业家精神的东德人都离开了那里，这段经历为民族凝聚力蒙上了厚厚一层阴影。	That was not enough to halt the hollowing out of the eastern Länder, as many of the ablest and most entrepreneurial people left – an experience that put enormous strain on national solidarity.
工作组的发现尚未公布，但组长的反转基因评论让该问题更加扑朔迷离，在这个急需转基因作物的当口，肯尼亚农民、科学家和公众却泥足深陷。	Its findings have not yet been made public, but anti-GM comments by the taskforce’s chair suggest further confusion on the issue, threatening to leave farmers, scientists, and the public in limbo at a time when GM crops are most needed.
当时我正要接受CNBC财经有线电视台记者史蒂夫·塞齐维克（Steve Sedgwick）的采访，我对他说 ： “ 那将是第一次。	I was about to be interviewed by the CNBC reporter Steve Sedgwick, to whom I said, “That would be a first.
在成功市场经济的诱惑和哈维尔等人所树立的榜样面前，共产主义体制已陷入了重重外患，金三世将无处寻找有效的援手。	Communism, thanks to the lure of successful market economies and the example set by people like Havel, has put the system under such external strain that Kim III has nowhere to turn for effective help.
但中国家庭将相对较低的储蓄中的如此高的部分储蓄起来的主要原因是确保在家庭成员需要动手术或其他住院治疗时有足够的钱支付高额医药费。	But the main reason why Chinese households save so much of their relatively low salaries is to ensure that they have the funds to meet high medical costs if a family member requires surgery or other inpatient care.
首先，特别检察官罗伯特·穆勒（Robert Mueller）会很好地记录特朗普、他的家庭成员和亲信幕僚的渎职行为。	First, Special Counsel Robert Mueller may very well document serious malfeasance by Trump, his family members, and/or his close advisers.
这可以追溯到一个世纪以前，伍德罗·威尔逊总统在1919年就无法说服短视且奉行孤立主义的国会批准国际联盟成立。	It goes back a century, to President Woodrow Wilson’s inability in 1919 to persuade a myopically isolationist Congress to approve the League of Nations.
4月30日，喀布尔9名记者被杀害，这一系列背靠背自杀式爆炸至少造成25人死亡，是塔利班倒台以来阿富汗新闻界最血腥的一天，也是全世界的黑暗之日。	The slaying of nine journalists in Kabul on April 30, in back-to-back suicide bombings that killed at least 25 people, marked the deadliest day for journalists in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, and added to a grim global tally.
最近有证据表明，如果向士兵提供了防护服，阵亡和负伤将会大为降低。 这表明短期的节省如何会导致长期的费用。	Recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor been provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-run costs.
根据IMF的数据，2012年末，发达国家平均债务/GDP比率为110 % ， 而新兴国家只有35 % ， 低收入国家只有42 % 。	According to the International Monetary Fund, the average debt/GDP ratio at the end of 2012 was 110% in the advanced countries, but just 35% for emerging countries and 42% for low-income countries.
在罗马帝国晚期，只有一位富裕的贵族购买了一位唱名官（nomenclator ） — —专门负责记忆姓名和相貌的，以便当贵族有社交要求时提醒他的奴隶。	In the late Roman Empire, only a wealthy aristocrat could have purchased a nomenclator – a slave tasked with memorizing names and faces, and reminding the aristocrat of them when social occasions demanded it.
但阿拉伯国家组建联合军队又带来另一个安全隐患：这样的联盟将对地区产生何种影响，尤其考虑到今天不断加剧的逊尼-什叶派分裂？	But, as some Arab countries move to establish a joint military force, another security question is emerging: Will such an alliance leave the region better or worse off, particularly given today’s growing Sunni-Shia divide?
比如，比尔·盖茨也许对经济转型是有利的，但墨西哥电信业富豪卡洛斯·斯利姆（Carlos Slim）就不是这样。	For example, whereas Bill Gates has probably been good for economic transformation, the Mexican telecoms billionaire Carlos Slim has not.
欧元区财政部长会议和国际货币基金组织（International Monetary Fund，简称IMF）已与希腊达成一致，应国际货币基金组织的要求为该国提供一定金额的债务减免，并发放103亿欧元（约合116亿美元）的救助资金。	Eurozone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund have agreed with Greece to begin, per the IMF’s demands, providing some debt relief to the country, and to release €10.3 billion ($11.6 billion) in bailout funds.
最近，利比里亚在后冲突时代重建和人权发展方面取得了成功（此前该国经历了14年的内战 ） ， 因此是发展日程高级别小组会议的理想举办地。	Given Liberia’s recent success in post-conflict reconstruction and human development, following a 14-year civil war, it is a fitting setting for the Panel’s deliberations.
我们的成员包括科技创业家、银行CEO、公民社会领导人、国际标准制定者、资本市场专家、中央银行行长、财政和经济部长以及联合国机构主管等。	Our membership includes tech entrepreneurs, bank CEOs, civil society leaders, international standard-setters, capital markets experts, central bank governors, finance and economic ministers, and heads of UN agencies.
莫迪在大选中赢得了压倒性胜利，这场选举反映出印度公众对印度当所领导的前任政府的政策和表现的失望之情。	Modi won a landslide victory in an election that reflected the Indian public’s disappointment with the policies and performance of the previous government, led by the Indian National Congress.
也许美联储本身担心监管合理化意味着要对其本身的责任进行一定程度的削减，危机爆发后，美联储的责任大大扩大了。	Or perhaps the Fed itself fears that regulatory rationalization is code for some cutback in its own responsibilities, which have been expanded remarkably since the crisis.
在法国国内，一个雄心勃勃、期盼已久而且困难重重的改革计划 — — 大多数法国人认为这个改革计划不可避免 — — 已经开始，并已经在劳动法律和教育方面初有成效。	Domestically, an ambitious and difficult program of long-awaited reforms, which a majority of French citizens recognize are inevitable, has begun, with some early results in the field of labor law and education.
在我受训的监管学校 — — 英格兰银行 — — 我们被告知永远不要使用那个致命的短语，担心因此产生我们恰恰希望避免的道德风险。	In the regulatory school where I was trained – the Bank of England – we were told never to use that fatal phrase, for fear of generating precisely the moral hazard we wished to avoid.
根据一项最新研究，让红利和资本利得税回到1997年前的水平（28 % ） 能抵消美国联邦公司税率从35%降至26%所导致的收入损失。	According to a recent study, restoring tax rates on dividends and capital gains to their pre-1997 levels of 28% could finance a reduction in the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 26%.
一个显著的例子是在英国脱欧运动期间遭到杀害的年轻英国议员乔·考克斯（Jo Cox ） ， 他在推进难民权利方面的领导力得到了超越党派界线的承认。	A shining example is Jo Cox, the young British MP who was murdered during the Brexit campaign, whose leadership in advocating for the rights of refugees was recognized across party lines.
为了对抗这些力量和政策，主流政党必须扭转失败（尽管事实站在它们这一边 ） ， 提供足够有说服力的叙事让选民选择经济开放。	To oppose such forces and policies, mainstream political parties will have to address their failure, even with the facts on their side, to offer a narrative compelling enough to convince voters to choose economic openness.
虽然去年十一月任中共总书记、今年三月任国家主席以来习近平主要忙于处理国内事务，但中印关系却可以直接影响到中国的国内局势。	While Xi has been preoccupied with his country’s domestic challenges since becoming Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General-Secretary last November, and now as president since March, relations with India can have a direct impact on internal conditions.
最后还有英国，人们一般认为英国是西欧世俗化程度最高的国家，因此，英国最不可能（在穆斯林团体之外）出现任何形式的宗教回归。	Finally, there is Britain, usually seen as perhaps the most secular country in Western Europe, and thus the least likely candidate to see the return of religion of any kind (outside its Muslim community).
尤其对于那些必须直接对民意变化做出反应的当选领导人来讲，这样的花言巧语降低了发动和支持战争的难度，也让他们更容易为发动战争找到借口。 在当今这个被媒体所左右的时代，这样的说法在任何社会中都同样有效。	Such rhetoric makes wars easier to justify, easier to wage, and easier to support, especially for elected leaders who must respond directly to swings in public opinion. Such language works equally well for any society in today’s media-obsessed age.
虽然中国的公共债务总量还算较低；但任何一位爱尔兰公民都可以告诉你，一旦银行业危机袭来，债务就会像气球那样膨胀。	Public debt in China is still relatively low; but, as any citizen of Ireland can tell you, it can balloon when banking crises strike.
但最基本的原因其实是不知道持续不断积累了数十年的高负债 — — 私人部门甚至比公共部门更多 — — 才是经济稳定的重大威胁。	But the fundamental reason was the failure to understand that high debt burdens, relentlessly rising for several decades – in the private sector even more than in the public sector – were a major threat to economic stability.
其领导人可以开始对抗不可持续现状带来的癌症，并承受上述斗争所带来的全部不确定性和痛苦；或者他们可以等待癌症进入终末期，之后被它吞噬掉。	Its leaders can begin fighting the cancer of an unsustainable status quo, with all the pain and uncertainty that such a struggle entails; or they can wait for the cancer to become a terminal condition, and be devoured by it.
中国人民银行意识到了这一危险，从2012年开始着手治理债务增长；但当减速开始给经济带来实打实的痛苦时，共产党接过了指挥棒。	Aware of the dangers, the People’s Bank of China took steps starting in 2012 to curb the growth of debt; but when the slowdown started to cause real distress in the economy, the Party asserted its supremacy.
高得惊人的青年失业率、不断缩水的社会安全网和基础设施/人力资本投资不足正加重着当前一代人的负担，且在越来越多的情况下，也将会有害于未来一代人。	Alarmingly high youth unemployment, shrinking social safety nets, and under-investment in infrastructure and human capital are burdening current generations and, in a growing number of cases, will adversely affect future generations as well.
因此，尽管谈判已经开始，但是，有关土耳其是否真正属于欧洲的强烈而生动的辩论在土耳其和欧盟继续展开，欧盟内部的辩论更为激烈。	As a result, the fierce and lively debate – in Turkey and much more emphatically in the EU – about whether Turkey really belongs to Europe has continued, despite the start of negotiations.
去年9月，美国与法国一道提出了联合国安理会1559号决议，要求叙利亚撤军并解除以真主党为首的一切民兵武装。	Last September, the US, together with France, sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding a Syrian pullout and the disarming of militias – mainly Hezbollah.
它们提醒我们，灾难预防并非可选择的奢侈品；它是一个持续的、密集的过程，是拯救生命、保护基础设施和捍卫发展的必要条件。	They serve as a reminder that disaster preparedness is not an optional luxury; it is a constant, intensive process that is necessary to save lives, protect infrastructure, and safeguard development.
米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）和我却提出了不同的反对意见，认为实行这样的政策必须得有一个持续上涨的通货膨胀率。	In different ways, Milton Friedman and I objected, arguing that such a policy would require an ever-rising inflation rate.
事实上，即使在执政期间，贝卢斯科尼也一直声称自己是司法机构、商业竞争对手 、 “ 共产主义分子”和政治机构的攻击对象。	Indeed, even while in office, Berlusconi consistently claimed that he was being attacked by the judiciary, by rival businessmen, by “communists,” by the political establishment.
如今看来中国显然是想利用这些储备去推进其全球地缘政治战略，而不是巩固支撑了其三十年繁荣发展的国际体系。	It now seems clear that China intends to use its foreign reserves to further its own global geopolitical strategy, not to buttress the international system that has enabled its three-decade boom.
如果伊朗在今年受到攻击，其后果会首先直接由该地区承担，但欧洲作为中东最近的西方邻居也会受到影响—这些后果会长期存在。	Should Iran be attacked this year, the consequences will be borne first and foremost by the region, but also by Europe as the Middle East’s immediate western neighbor – and they will be felt for a long time to come.
在最近的全民公投中，瑞士人民婉拒了UBI，但致力于更加激进的方针帮助需要人士值得欢迎，即使UBI的详情及其成本仍有待论证。	Swiss citizens roundly rejected that approach in a recent referendum, but the energy devoted to more radical approaches to help those who need it is welcome, even if the specifics of UBI and its cost have yet to proven.
或者，他们也可以保持当前的渐进方针，该方针本质上即投入少量公共资源，强迫情况较好的银行支持情况较差的银行。	Alternatively, they could also maintain the current piecemeal approach, which has essentially committed small amounts of public resources and forced the stronger banks to support the weaker ones.
此外，我们还必须提供技术和研究支持���他们能生产出更加优质的产品，并提供冷藏设备以便农民能在价格最高时出售自己的产品。	In addition, we need to provide them with research and technology to ensure that they can grow the best-quality produce, and storage capabilities so that they can sell at peak prices.
对于格林斯潘的两项“重罪”指控是：他本应该更努力地制止1990年代的股市泡沫和本世纪初的房地产泡沫。	The “felonies” of which Greenspan stands accused are the other two charges: that he should have done more to stop the stock market bubble of the late 1990’s, and that he should have done more to stop the housing bubble of the early 2000’s.
但这个问题并不仅限于国会不受内幕交易法案管辖的问题，真正的要害其实是美国国会（跟许多其他国家的立法机构一样）并非基于那些适用于普通公民的法规而运作。	Yet the problem is not simply Congress’s exemption from insider-trading law. The real issue is that the US Congress – like many countries’ legislatures – lives by rules that are very different from those imposed on ordinary citizens.
其他人选还有利比亚前驻法大使奥马尔·布里贝什（Omar Brebesh ） ， 不过此君后来被证实死亡，而且显然是被一位带头推翻卡扎菲的民兵头目折磨致死的。	Others, such as Libya’s former ambassador to France, Omar Brebesh, were found dead, apparently tortured by a militia that spearheaded the campaign to overthrow Qaddafi.
作为行政目标的宣传语 ， “ 中华民族的伟大复兴”有点长了，但它最近被改成了较为简单的“中国梦 ” 。	As a catchphrase for his administration’s objective, “the great renaissance of the Chinese nation” is bit long, but it has lately morphed into the simpler “China Dream.”
阿勒萨尼在政治上的大胆部分源于卡塔尔庞大的油气资源，他借此在所有领域制定了强硬的政策，其中特别需要提到外交领域。	Al Thani’s political audacity stems partly from Qatar’s enormous gas resources, which have allowed him to develop vigorous policies in all areas, especially in foreign affairs.
有些专家认为强硬反对禁核条约可能导致对核不扩散条约感到失望的国家产生反弹，导致众多国家从1958年条约中退出。	Some experts have suggested that hardline opposition to the ban treaty could prompt a backlash from countries that have grown disillusioned with the NPT, leading to widespread withdrawal from the 1968 treaty.
克格勃在普京统治下的政治复苏，以及他们为压制反对意见所做的一切努力，终于再一次使俄国变成了背叛者的天堂。	The political resurrection of KGB structures under Putin, and their efforts to silence dissent, has once again turned Russia into a country of defectors.
但是，考虑到中国的规模和多样性 — — 更不用说其深深融入全球经济的状况 — — 在各个地区、部门和社会群体中沟通和实施新政策并不容易。	But, given China’s size and diversity, not to mention its deep integration into the global economy, communicating and implementing new policies across regions, sectors, and social groups will be very difficult.
与此形成鲜明对照的是，反对父母那一代的观点，重新发掘传统的道德准则能够拯救法国¾这样的观点对教育和移民等问题都大有裨益，而上述问题在竞选活动中占据了主导地位。	By contrast, rebelling against one’s parents’ generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France – a message that is highly applicable to issues, such as education and immigration, that may dominate the electoral campaign.
除了强大的军队和安全机关，俄罗斯现在还有联邦国家卫队（Rosgvardiya ） ， 这是一支普京在2016年成立的直接听命于他的特遣队。	Beyond the amped-up military and the powerful security services, there is now the National Guard of the Russian Federation, or Rosgvardiya, a contingent of some 340,000 personnel created by Putin in 2016 that answers directly to him.
尽管美国在黎巴嫩，索马里，越南和柬埔寨分别履行了千差万别的责任，历史显示撤出上述地区虽然会立刻影响美国的声誉，但是最终还是对美国有益。	Although American commitments to Lebanon, Somalia, Vietnam, and Cambodia differed mightily, history reveals that despite immediate costs to America’s reputation, disengagement ultimately redounded to America’s advantage.
此外，他的引人注目的癖好 — — 用无关的推特抨击让好消息黯然失色 — — 导致全盘左倾、与他毫无同理心可言的媒体过于强调他的个性，而忽略他的政府的实质性的成功。	Moreover, his remarkable penchant for overshadowing good news with unrelated Twitter attacks allows an overwhelmingly leftist, unsympathetic media to overemphasize his personality, while ignoring his administration’s substantive successes.
就家庭资产负债表损害（这种损害显然影响了人们的储蓄倾向）而言，各个国家的差异很大 — — 乘数效应也是如此。	Countries vary widely in terms of household balance-sheet damage, which clearly affects the propensity to save – and hence the multiplier effect.
一开始，日本银行对于据此调整货币政策显得相当犹豫，坐视日元升值 — — 这一决定导致日本长期停滞的经济陷入了衰退。	At first, the Bank of Japan hesitated to adjust its monetary policy accordingly, allowing the yen to appreciate – a decision that drove the country’s long-stagnant economy into recession.
牛津大学经济学家马克斯·罗瑟（Max Roser）指出，在过去25年中，报纸每天都可以发布《自昨天以来，极端贫困人口减少137,000人》的标题。	As Oxford University economist Max Roser points out, newspapers could have published the headline, “People in extreme poverty fell by 137,000 since yesterday,” every day for the past 25 years.
在这个挑战成为全球性而克服这些挑战将越来越依赖于多边合作的世界中，只有这样，���能促进和维护欧洲“经济和货币联盟”的经济利益。	This is the only way to promote and defend the EMU’s economic interests in a world where the challenges are global and overcoming them will increasingly depend on multilateral cooperation.
几十年来，西方列强一直支持着阿拉伯世界的军事统治，有意忽略它们对民主运动和权利的系统性镇压，以确保伊斯兰教不会赢得权力。	For decades, Western powers backed military regimes in the Arab world, willingly ignoring their systematic repression of democratic movements and rights, in order to ensure that Islamists did not gain power.
寡头集团为把持石油收入而斗争，民粹主义者承诺重新分配石油收入，两大集团都竭尽所能为自己攫取最大的好处。	Oligarchs fight to keep control over the oil revenues, populists promise to redistribute them, and both groups steal as much as they can for themselves.
更重要的是，帕多安已开始实施财政政策 — — 降低税收并维持公共支出计划，丝毫不顾德国和欧盟委员会收紧预算的要求。	More important, Padoan has started to implement fiscal stimulus by cutting taxes and maintaining public spending plans, in defiance of German and EU Commission demands to tighten his budget.
在大学里，女生不仅在人数上超过男生，而且她们也比男生成绩要好，最为显著的是在数学、物理以及信息科学方面。	Women not only outnumber men at universities; they also outperform them, most notably in math, physics, and information science.
联邦政府可以也应当在任何地方制定战略方向，树立可以度量的目标和培育新的模式，以建立适合二十一世纪的教育系统。	The federal government can and should set the strategic direction, establish measurable goals, and foster new models wherever they might arise to build an educational system fit for the twenty-first century.
如今，土耳其决策者必须捍卫司法的自治地位和政治上的公正性，重塑全体公民所共有的言论自由，并建立政府机关的相互制衡以取代军队成为世俗主义的捍卫者。	Turkish policymakers must now guarantee the judiciary’s autonomy and political impartiality, restore freedom of expression for all citizens, and establish a system of checks and balances to replace the military as the guardian of secularism.
普京对国家媒体的控制自2013年12月以来一直在收紧，今日俄罗斯财团对各频道展开重组以便更好地报道俄罗斯“新闻 ” 。	Putin’s grip on state media has been tightening since December 2013, when channels were regrouped in the Rossiya Segodnya consortium to improve the presentation of Russia’s “story.”
从几十年前巴西的巴尔加斯和阿根廷的庇隆，到今天尼加拉瓜的奥尔特加和委内瑞拉的马杜罗，民粹主义者滥用民主规则，有时甚至演变为彻底的独裁。	From Getúlio Vargas in Brazil and Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina decades ago to Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela today, populists have abused democratic rules and, in some cases, become outright dictators.
虽然在全国各地偏远地区大肆兴建诊所和其他医疗设施看似是实现全民医疗卫生保障的最简捷手段，但事实却并非如此。	But while rushing to construct clinics and other medical facilities in even the remotest regions may seem like a straightforward approach to ensuring universal health coverage, that has not turned out to be true.
乐观的观点认为财产权比过去更深入人心了，而俄罗斯的未来取决于与依法办事的政府休戚相关的中产阶级在多快的时间内能产生。	The optimistic view is that property rights are becoming more deeply anchored than they were in the past, and that Russia’s future will depend on how fast a middle class with a stake in law-based government can be created.
相反，中国腐败现象泛滥，没有新闻自由，国家资本主义意味着太子党的行为不受约束 — — 并且通常不为人所知。	In China, by contrast, pervasive corruption, the absence of a free press, and state capitalism mean that princelings’ conduct is unconstrained – and typically shrouded in secrecy.
在弗里德曼这一观点的信徒看来，一个经理人如果摒弃了股东利益最大化而是为其他目标奔忙的话，那就是离经叛道之举。	For the true believers in this creed, the suggestion that the manager of a business should strive for anything except maximizing value for shareholders is heresy.
希拉特贾拉哈的一位村民莫贝尔·阿卜杜拉·阿里·贾拉哈（Moqbel Abdullah Ali al-Jarraah）说 ： “ 我认为美国拿我们贫穷村庄试验它的致命发明，因为它不能在其他任何人命很值钱的地方进行试验。	As the father of Nasser Mohammed Nasser, one of four innocent civilians killed in a US drone strike on April 19, 2014, lamented: “My son and those who were with him had nothing to do with Al Qaeda. They were simply on their way to earn a living.
战争爆发前的几年内，资本流入量高达占国内生产总值的20 ％ ， 2007年的全年经济增长跃升至12 ％以上。 自2003年以来，格鲁吉亚经历了近40 ％的增长 。	With capital inflows amounting to 20% of GDP in the years before the war, annual economic growth jumped to over 12% in 2007, with the country experiencing almost 40% growth since 2003.
发自香港 — — 毫无疑问，各新兴经济体都正面临着严峻的挑战，并在阻碍了它们过往那种爆发式增长的同时削弱了其发展前景。	HONG KONG – It is no secret that emerging economies are facing serious challenges, which have undermined their once-explosive growth and weakened their development prospects.
减少工作岗位的技术进步、恶化的收入不平等、人口变化、日益遭到破坏的自然资源和环境耗竭给骆驼压上了更多的稻草。	Job-eroding technological advances, worsening income inequality, demographic shifts, dwindling natural resources, and environmental depletion are adding even more straws to the camel’s back.
当TVN24的莫尼卡·奥莱伊尼克要他在希拉里·克林顿和唐纳德·特朗普之间作出选择时，他回答说这就像选择霍乱和瘟疫。	When TVN24’s Monika Olejnik asked him to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, he replied that it would be like choosing between plague and cholera.
慕尼黑 — — 有关2015-2017年欧盟委员会3150亿欧元（合3900亿美元）投资计划的更多细节终于水落石出。	MUNICH – More details about the European Commission’s €315 billion ($390 billion) investment plan for 2015-2017 have finally come to light.
与此一脉相承的是，由美国大公司首席执行官组成的商业圆桌会议（Business Roundtable）派出律师大军镇压着股东的请愿。	In a similar vein, the Business Roundtable, composed of CEOs of major US corporations, has deployed brigades of lawyers to squelch shareholders’ aspirations.
更高的经济开放度加上固定的名义汇率，使中国摆脱了通胀，并且在1994年以后的实际GDP增长也变得更加稳定。	Greater economic openness, coupled with the fixed nominal exchange rate, ended China’s inflationary roller-coaster ride, and, after 1994, real GDP growth also became more stable.
但是，尽管全球政治条件没有达到其可以达到的美好程度 — — 从来都是这样 — — 但也有充分的理由认为它们并不像许多人宣称的那样糟糕。	But, though global political conditions are hardly as good as they could be – they never are – there are plenty of grounds for thinking that they are not nearly as bad as so many are claiming.
该计划包括以极低廉的价格向企业家提供土地、面向工厂主的最长七年的免税、以及面向农民的最长十年的低息贷款。	The package includes the provision of land to industrialists at dramatically reduced prices, tax exemptions of up to seven years for factory owners, and low-interest loans of up to ten years for farmers.
结果肯定会展示从去年地震和海啸中所学到的教训，并试图鼓励全世界各国致力于降低灾难风险，提高恢复力，进一步深化政治合作和经济投入。	The outcome will certainly reflect what was learned from last year’s earthquake and tsunami, and seek to encourage deeper political and economic commitment to disaster-risk reduction and resilience worldwide.
刚刚卸任的美联储官员杰里米·斯坦（Jeremy Stein，与卡拉·斯坦没有关系）指出，被迫的“紧急甩卖”资产行为是风险传播的重要方式。	Jeremy Stein (no relation to Kara Stein), until recently a governor of the US Federal Reserve System, has suggested that forced “fire sales” of assets are one important way that risks are transmitted.
结果是全球需求不足（全球投资达不到充分就业水平下的全球储蓄）和短期资本流波动频繁（为了给消费和房地产融资 ） 。	The result is inadequate global demand (global investments falling short of global saving at full employment) and highly volatile short-term capital flows to finance consumption and real estate.
他明确声明美国会在双方同意下支持两国方案，同时选择把美国大使馆留在特拉维夫，尽管这本不过是将美国驻耶路撒冷领事馆换个牌子的事情。	He made clear that the US would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides. And he chose not to begin actually moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv, even though he could have simply relabeled what is now the US consulate in Jerusalem.
许多中央银行家将美联储前主席阿兰·格林斯潘（1987年8月至2006年1月在任）视为始作俑者，认为是他创造了一个中央银行万能的假象，而这个假象在理论或者实际上都是站不住脚的。	Many central bankers portray former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (who served from August 1987 until January 2006) as the culprit, saying that he projected an image of central-bank omnipotence that is not warranted in theory or practice.
如果把价格转化为一桶桶石油的话，那么，进口技术是便宜的。 所以，该国缺少自己的地质学家和化学家，更不用说经济学家和律师了。	Imported technologies are cheap if you convert their prices into barrels of oil, so the country produces a shortage of its own geologists and chemists, not to mention economists and lawyers.
黎巴嫩近代史给人们的教训中，有一个比其它都引人注目，即：在诸如黎巴嫩和伊拉克这样的政权分掌社会，联盟民主体制比多数选举制的胜者全拿型民主更受青睐。	One lesson from Lebanon’s recent history stands out above all others: in divided political societies such as Lebanon and Iraq, coalition democracy is preferable to majoritarian winner-takes-all democracy.
某位愚昧的分析师说 ： “ 20%的心脏病改善（减少）加上30%的糖尿病发病率改善（减少）等于50%的改善 。 ” 这是不对的。	It is not, as one benighted analyst suggested, “A 20% improvement (reduction) in heart attacks plus a 30% improvement (reduction) in diabetes incidence equals a 50% improvement.”
我们所需要的只是进行恰当的财政刺激来诱使电力公司生产更少的电能（但是同时确保更高的利润）以及使消费者减少他们使用的电能（在减少开支的同时并没有降低舒适度 ） 。	All that is needed are the right financial incentives to induce utility companies to produce less electricity (and still be more profitable) and consumers to reduce their use (and gain savings without sacrificing comfort).
除了耗资数十亿纳税人的钱之外，保尔森的计划还违反了资本主义的基本原则，即获得的收益的人也须承担损失。	Aside from costing billions of taxpayer dollars, Paulson’s plan violates the fundamental capitalist principle that whoever reaps the gains also bears the losses.
除了美联储这一显著例外，央行担心货币升值对国内公司的竞争力影响太大，因此不得不干预；事实上，越来越多的央行积极引导货币贬值。	With the notable exception of the Fed, central banks fear the impact of an appreciating currency on domestic companies' competitiveness too much not to intervene; indeed, an increasing number of them are working actively to weaken their currencies.
此外，正如哥伦比亚大学的提尔·冯·韦希特尔（Till von Wachter ）所证明的那样，父母的长期失业对其子女有着严重而持久的负面影响。	In addition, as Till von Wachter of Columbia University has documented, prolonged periods of unemployment for parents have a severe and lasting negative impact on their children.
又一次，一个“亲美”的独裁者似乎正在快速地失去他对权力的控制，而他的美国盟友只是半心半意地站在他的一边。	Once again, a “pro-American” autocrat seems to be rapidly losing his grip on power, with his US ally only half-heartedly standing by him.
比方说安哥拉内战，红色高棉屠杀数百万柬埔寨人、卢旺达部落战争、南斯拉夫血腥解体和南苏丹对基督徒的残忍灭绝。	Remember Angola’s civil war, the Khmer Rouge’s massacre of millions of Cambodians, Rwanda’s tribal wars, the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the extermination of Christians in Southern Sudan.
但因为非国大目前显然决心用该党新领袖西里尔·拉马福萨来取代雅各布·祖马（Jacob Zuma）总统丑闻缠身的政府，人们有理由充满希望。	Yet, with the African National Congress now apparently determined to replace President Jacob Zuma’s scandal-ridden administration with one led by the party’s new leader, Cyril Ramaphosa, there is reason for hope.
在其关于不平等性的讲话中，奥巴马重申了几个加速增长的措施：增加出口、改革公司税制、加大基础设施、研发和教育投资。	In his inequality speech, Obama reiterated several proposals to accelerate growth: increasing exports, reforming the corporate tax code, and investing more in infrastructure, R&D, and education.
对于巴基斯坦和印度两国来说，阿富汗有可能变成一个新的，类似克什米尔这样的不稳定地区，而克什米尔的冲突已经祸害了两国超过60年。	For both Pakistan and India, Afghanistan risks turning into a new disputed territory, like Kashmir, where conflict has damaged both countries for more than 60 years.
虽然该政策成功维持了中国的经济增长，但也因此受到了广泛指责，认为这是最终导致了货币过度扩张的一次过激反应。	Though the policy succeeded in buttressing China’s economic growth, it was widely criticized as an overreaction – one that led to excessive monetary expansion.
事实上，国际社会本可以通过向三个前沿国家（土耳其、黎巴嫩、约旦，它们加起来接收了大约四百万叙利亚难民）提供哪怕最小的支持来遏制去年的危机。	Indeed, the international community could have blunted last year’s crisis by providing even modest support for the three frontline countries – Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan – which together host some four million Syrian refugees.
也许仅仅是某些家长或女生误以为接种一针HPV疫苗就可以防止感染，或者是某些弱势女孩无法得到校内接种服务。	It may simply be that some parents or girls mistakenly believe that one shot of the HPV vaccine is enough to provide protection, or that some socially disadvantaged girls lack sufficient access to in-school vaccination services.
欧盟政治家和官员将模糊的自由、平等、博爱三位一体塑造为一个实在：涵盖了从床头到车间的各种权利和规则的80,000页法律。	Its politicians and officials have translated the vague trinity of liberty, equality, and fraternity into a concrete form: 80,000 pages of laws that cover rights and regulations from the bedroom to the factory floor.
所以欧盟的一个首要目标是通过一个经济和政治上相互依赖、生气勃勃的结构来促进稳定和安全。 所有的国家在这个结构中都有既得利益。	So a prime objective of the European Union is to promote stability and security through a dynamic structure of economic and political inter-dependence in which all nations have a vested interest.
与大规模政府间转移支付不同 — — 政府间转移支付常常肥了官员的腰包 — — 非洲力量的核心是确保协议真正落实、投资流向意向目标。	Unlike big government-to-government transfers, which can often end up in the pockets of officials, the point is to ensure that deals actually get done and investments flow to their intended destination.
各国现在必须采取行动，以确保每个人-不论其财富、种族、性别或宗教的不同-拥有相同的权利，且这些权利在法律颁布的时候已包含其中。	Nations must act now to ensure that everyone – regardless of wealth, ethnicity, sex, or religion – has the same rights, and that these rights are enshrined in laws at the time they are enacted.
大量研究表明，移民对于本土出生的工人的工资和就业的消极效应可以忽略不计，更不用说目的国的财政资源了。	A large body of research shows that immigrants have a negligible negative impact on the wages and employment of native-born workers, not to mention on the fiscal resources of destination countries.
如今，这一发现获得了神经科学的支持。 神经科学研究了这段时期大脑如何发育，并开发了一套测量学习差距的系统。	This observation is now backed by neuroscience, which has identified how the brain develops over that period and has created a system for measuring learning gaps.
而由于发达国家和新兴市场都面临着严重的下行风险，修正走势可能只是2013年全球经济和金融市场糟糕表现的开端。	And, given the seriousness of the downside risks to growth in advanced and emerging economies alike, the correction could be a bellwether of worse to come for the global economy and financial markets in 2013.
一边是美国缺乏基础设施投资同时却在金融衍生品上投资过度 — — 这是过度消费所导致的隐性高杠杆所结下的恶果。	The US lacks investment in infrastructure and has excess investment in financial derivatives – the result of opaque leverage from over-consumption.
毕竟，高增长水平能带来大量租（rent ） ， 而租通过腐败行为在官员本人、他们朋友和亲信之间进行分配。	After all, high levels of growth translate into large rents that can, through corrupt practices, be distributed to the officials themselves, as well as to their friends and protégé.
只有暴力才会逆转这一进程，但是不大可能，因为黎巴嫩需要一位新的总统的认同度是如此之高，所有黎巴嫩人民对武力的抵触心理是如此的根深蒂固。	This can only be reversed by violence, which is unlikely, so strong is the consensus that Lebanon needs a new president, and so ingrained is the rejection of force by all Lebanese.
这些性权利应该包括选择性伙伴的权利、决定是否、何时和与谁结婚的权利、减少性骚扰的权利，甚至向另一位同意的成年人购买性活动的权利。	These sexual rights would include the right to choose one’s sexual partners; decide whether, when, and whom to marry; decline sexual advances; and even buy sex from another consenting adult.
与此同时，银行联盟 — — 已由欧盟在2007—2008年全球金融危机爆发后建立 — — 应该得到强化，扩大单一清算基金（Single Resolution Fund）的资本基础并建立一个共同存款担保机制。	At the same time, the banking union, established by the EU in the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, should be strengthened by enlarging the capital base of the Single Resolution Fund and establishing a common deposit guarantee scheme.
多年来，非洲人权活动家在人权观察组织（Human Rights Watch）的帮助下一直在致力于问责哈布雷。	For many years, African human-rights activists, aided by Human Rights Watch, struggled to hold him accountable.
印度不断提升的利率，高通胀以及严重的政策瓶颈，再加上大量的政府腐败丑闻都让国内外投资者望而却步，以致经济增长未能充分发挥其潜力。	Rising interest rates, high inflation, and severe policy gridlock amid a spate of government corruption scandals have impeded both foreign and domestic investment in India, thus slowing economic growth to a level that is below its potential.
好消息是美国正在以比其他任何主要工业化经济体都要快的速度增长，因此墨西哥可以期待 — — 根据IMF的数据 — — 未来几年实现经济扩张加速。	The good news is that the US is growing faster than any other major industrialized economy, so Mexico can look forward – according to the IMF – to a couple of years of accelerating economic expansion.
在1992年世界各国政府第一次保证解决人为全球气候变暖的时候，他们同时还誓言阻止由人类引发的其他物种的灭绝。	In 1992, when the world’s governments first promised to address man-made global warming, they also vowed to head off the human-induced extinction of other species.
欧盟领导人希望尽快依照《里斯本条约》的第50条（成员国退出条款）开始走流程，也敦促英国方面从速照此办理。	The EU leadership would like to move the process along and has called on the UK to immediately take steps to do so, as outlined in Article 50, the member-withdrawal provision of the Treaty of Lisbon.
此外，研究表明在教室中使用笔记本电脑会学生学习进程放慢，即使他们用笔记本电脑来记笔记而不是网络冲浪。	Moreover, research shows that laptops in the classroom slow student learning, even when used to take notes, rather than surf the web.
此外，考虑到中国也持有（因此目前正在抛售）欧元，欧洲央行也应该在12月决定是否加码其本身的量化宽松计划是考虑到这一点。	And, given that China holds (and is therefore now selling) euros as well, the European Central Bank also should bear this in mind when it decides in December whether to ramp up its own program of quantitative easing.
日益恶化的美国失衡则是中国失衡的镜像 — — 巨大的国内储蓄不足、前所未有的经常项目赤字、过度负债、归根结底建立在投机流沙之上的依赖资产的经济。	Mounting imbalances in the US were the mirror image of those in China – a massive shortfall of domestic saving, unprecedented current-account deficits, excess debt, and an asset-dependent economy that was ultimately built on speculative quicksand.
这一主权的文化基础最终植根于一个民族所居住的独特的地域 — — 比如，内陆民族是内向的，沿海民族则是外向的。	This cultural basis of sovereignty is ultimately rooted in the distinctive geography – say, land-locked and oriented internally, or coastal and outward-looking – that a people inhabit.
危险的是，正如之前经常所发生得那样，真正的价值变化的可能性将被那些把它看作又一个赚钱的机会的人霸占。	The danger is that the potential for a real change in values will be co-opted, as has happened so often before, by those who see it as just another opportunity to make money.
通过提高石油和天然气的价格，或限制供应，在格鲁吉亚炫耀武力，或派遣军舰出访古巴和委内瑞拉从而在世界舞台上显示实力，普京已经让许多人相信俄罗斯东山再起。	By increasing oil and gas prices, or limiting supplies, flexing its military muscles in Georgia, or sending ships to Cuba and Venezuela to parade Russia’s power on the world stage, Putin has convinced many people that Russia is back.
可富裕国家期待贫穷国家限制其对生物燃料的使用，而不为这些国家提供必不可少的财政援助去开发新的能源并进行能源资源的可持续发展。	The rich world somehow expects poor countries to restrict their use of fossil fuels without any significant help in financing new and sustainable sources of energy.
关键是中、法、俄、英、美等安理会五大常任理事国拥有一票否决权，因此只要五巨头中有一个不赞成即使其他国家多数赞成也没有用。	Crucially, the Security Council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the US – have veto power, so a majority means nothing if a single member of the P-5 dissents.
相互依存关系铸就伙伴之间健康的互动，双方自己满足自己的需要而不依赖他人，并且在维持自身身份的同时维护双边关系的共同利益。	An interdependent relationship fosters healthy interaction between partners, who satisfy their own needs rather than relying on others to do so, and maintain their own identities while appreciating the relationship’s mutual benefits.
美国在亚洲安全中所扮演的模糊角色 — — 因为它既要支持地区盟友，又不想与中国对立 — — 加剧了不确定性。	America’s ambiguous role in Asian security – owing to its interest in supporting its regional allies while not antagonizing China – contributes to the uncertainty.
5月19日，一组韩国科学家在《科学》杂志上公布了第一次将分离的人类胚胎干细胞专用于与不同年龄男女病人的DNA相匹配的研究结果。	On May 19, a group of Korean scientists published in the magazine Science the results of research that for the first time isolated human embryonic stem cell lines specifically tailored to match the DNA of male and female patients of various ages.
奥巴马将两国的会谈从财政部主导的经济会议扩充到双方政府主导的战略对话，这其中就包括气候变化等众多问题。	Obama broadened the Treasury-led economic meetings to a strategic dialogue co-chaired by the State Department with an agenda that includes climate change as well as multilateral issues.
在伊朗裔美国人纳齐·莫伊尼安（Nazee Moinian）家中，齐聚一样的精英们达成了共识。 莫伊尼安的公寓位于曼哈顿，模仿阿冈昆圆桌会（Algonquin Round Table）成员的高贵居所。	At the home of the Iranian-American Nazee Moinian, whose Manhattan apartment recalls the patrician abodes of the members of the Algonquin Round Table, the assembled elites are in agreement.
但如此急迫的问题 — — 以及强制规定所有流离失所的儿童必须接受教育的国际法 — — 仍然未能敦促各方行动起来。	Yet urgency – and international law, which mandates the education of all displaced children – fails to inspire action.
除了这个目标仔细确定 — — 并且目标大体限定的任务之外，还需要在全社会加强共同价值和相互合作的范围，毕竟这个社会还要继续保持多元文化。	Beyond this carefully targeted – and, in principle, limited – task, there remains the need to strengthen the sphere of common values and cooperation in societies that will, after all, remain multicultural.
资本管制会破坏人民币国际化的努力，让IMF下不了台 — — 它最近才将人民币纳入决定其账户单位特别提款权（SDR）的货币篮子中。	Capital controls would undermine China’s efforts to internationalize the renminbi and would embarrass the International Monetary Fund, which recently added the currency to the basket of four major currencies underpinning its unit of account, the SDR.
明显这是一个巨大的代价，相当于欧盟总成本提高至少50 % 。 而且，还有可能更高(欧盟委员会以前估计成本是目前估计的一倍 ) 。	This is obviously a hefty price tag – at least a 50% increase in the total cost of the EU – and it will likely be much higher (the Commission has previously estimated the cost to be double its current estimate).
另一方面，一些私营企业及部门却蒸蒸日上，最新的行政体制改革导致2014年3月以来的企业注册量增加了54 % 。	The private sector, by contrast, is picking up steam, with recent administrative reforms having contributed to a 54% rise in business registrations since March 2014.
2009年令全球贸易量创出历史跌幅记录（10.5 % ） 的可怕外部需求冲击导致中国的出口导向型经济迅速地从繁荣走向了破灭。	Hit by a monstrous external demand shock that sent world trade tumbling by a record 10.5% in 2009, China’s export-led growth quickly went from boom to bust.
它应当鼓励联合国秘书长不要过于担心动用宪章第99条赋予的重大权力，凭借一己之力让安理会关注相关事务。	It should encourage the UN’s secretary-general to be less nervous about using his formidable authority under Article 99 of the Charter to bring matters to the Council’s attention on his own.
例如目前来看，不太可能在规定时间内实现包括消灭新生儿及儿童可预防死亡的可持续健康目标（SDG 3 ） 。	For example, the health goal (SDG 3), which includes a target for eliminating preventable deaths among newborns and children, is unlikely to be achieved in the allotted timeframe.
他在麻省理工学院呆了一年，在那里他和Robert Solow一起执教并且遇到了萨缪尔森和Franco Modigliani。	He spent another year at MIT, where he taught with Robert Solow and met Samuelson and Franco Modigliani.
在大部分国家和地区，巴黎协定的承诺 — — 它已经不足以将全球升温幅度控制在1.5℃阈值以下 — — 没有得到落实。	In most countries and regions, the Paris agreement’s pledges, which already are insufficient to keep the increase in global temperatures below the 1.5°C threshold, are not being fulfilled.
最明显的是，奥巴马政府不得不缺席十月在巴厘岛举行的亚太经济合作组织（APEC）峰会，阻碍了美国���主导的跨太平洋伙伴关系的进程。	Most visibly, the Obama administration had to cancel its participation at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bali in October, impeding progress on the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.
而为机器本身制订一套伦理的需要一直没有得到讨论，同样被遗漏的还有在出现伦理两难时机器如何解决的问题。	What is missing from the discussion is the need to develop a set of ethics for the machines themselves, together with a means for machines to resolve ethical dilemmas as they arise.
允许他们将这些问题宗教化，就使那些他们一直企图强加于人的观点合法化了。 这在他们各自的社会中更是如此。	Allowing them to frame these problems in religious terms legitimizes the perspective that they are attempting to impose, particularly in their own societies.It also allows them to camouflage their very worldly thirst for power.
尽管如此，如果由过去20年来一直领导着直接外资自由化运动的发达国家再来带头发起抵制运动，这未免太过具有讽刺意味。	It would be ironic, though, if developed countries – which led the FDI liberalization wave of the past two decades – now led a backlash against FDI.
全美国的小镇银行家希望得到政府担保的存款保险，而更强大的大城市银行担心政府存款保险会让他们处于竞争劣势。	Small-town bankers throughout the country wanted government-guaranteed deposit insurance, while stronger big-city banks feared that government deposit insurance would put them at a competitive disadvantage.
增加累进所得税，有效地将财富从高收入人群到中等收入人群再到低收入人群进行重新分配，同时通过促进整体需求降低不公平性，增加了就业率。	More progressive taxation, in effect redistributing income from the top to the middle and bottom, would simultaneously reduce inequality and increase employment by boosting total demand.
结果是以色列政权与亚洲国家越来越相似，即在看重经济创新的同时漠视普世价值（和平就是以色列的普世价值 ） 。	As a result, the Israeli state seems to be moving closer to its Asian counterparts, with their emphasis on economic innovation and their indifference to universal values or, for that matter, peace.
世界银行为尼日利亚和巴基斯坦提供前端长期零息贷款用于采购口服脊髓灰质炎疫苗，而其他三个组织负责与贷款有关的维持和偿还费用。	The Bank provided upfront long-term zero-interest loans for the purchase of oral polio vaccines in Nigeria and Pakistan, while the other three organizations covered all service and commitment charges associated with the loans.
但是尤科斯事件是否像克里姆林宫所坚持认为的那样，只是个案而已，就要对俄罗斯总统普京的动机进行解读了。	But whether the Yukos affair proves to be an isolated case, as the Kremlin insists, depends on a reading of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motives.
无论这些政党是否会在不久的将来在选举中取得成功，它们的出现应该使人对欧元长期的过度乐观的看法产生怀疑。	Whether or not these parties succeed at the ballot box in the immediate future, their emergence should cast doubt on overly sanguine views about the euro’s longevity.
旁遮普省费萨拉巴德的一位宗教活动家，加利·努尔·默罕默德最近在未被指控的情况下被逮捕和拘押了几天。 最后他的尸体被扔到了自家门口。	Qari Noor Mohammad, a religious activist in Faisalabad in Punjab province, was arrested recently and held without charge for several days before his corpse was dumped in front of his house.
如果集体行动条款要求（比如）每种债券级别都有75%多数的持有者，那么兀鹫只要买入一种债券类别的26 % ， 就可以阻挠整个重组。	If a CAC required, say, 75% of the holders of each bond class, vultures could buy 26% of only one bond class and block the entire restructuring.
临近的窗户被震碎，鸟儿们也被纷纷惊起。 44岁的谢里梅特几乎立刻丧生，乌克兰检方很快确认，爆炸系由炸弹引起。	Sheremet, 44, died almost instantly, and the Ukraine Prosecutor’s Office quickly confirmed that a bomb had caused the explosion.
特别是，热电站取代了日本的核电站 — — 后者自2011年东日本大地震以来便处于停机状态，弱势日元极大地影响了石油和天然气进口支出。	In particular, thermal electricity plants have replaced the country’s nuclear plants – offline since the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 – and the weak yen has hit the import bill for oil and gas hard.
没人真的愿意打仗，但没人知道如何反对打仗，因为像德国的俾斯麦这样的伟大政治家（他的克制让欧洲得到了几十年的和平）也会在1914年的欧洲败下阵来。	No one really wanted war, but no one knew how to oppose it, because great statesmen like Germany’s Otto von Bismarck, whose self-restraint preserved peace in Europe for decades, were missing in Europe in 1914.
即使比特币业者能成功降低进行验证交易的巨大能源成本，其去中心化分类账系统的本质也使其效率远远低于那些拥有像央行这类受信任核心运作方的系统。	And even if Bitcoiners manage to find a way to lower the phenomenal energy cost of verifying transactions, the very nature of decentralized ledger systems makes them vastly less efficient than systems with a trusted central party like a central bank.
不幸的是，这些制药商还利用发展中国家不够严格的法规和执法以及贿赂官员获得进入地方药品供应链的通行证，出现在各大药店中。	Unfortunately, those drug makers then take advantage of developing countries’ weak or poorly implemented legislation and corrupt officials to pass their products through local supply chains and into shops.
真相是它们永远不可能可信：赤字只有在经济增长时才会减少，而削减预算，不管是真正的发生的还是预料中的，都会阻碍增长。	The truth is that they never could be: the deficit cannot come down unless the economy grows, and budget cuts, real and anticipated, hinder growth.
1997年，石油巨头在开始气候变化研究近20年后隐瞒了自己的研究成果，声称气候科学“很不明朗 ” ， 因此并不支持出台“强制削减能源使用”的规定。	In 1997, almost two decades after it began studying climate change, it quashed its research, claiming that climate science was “far from clear” and thus that it did not “support mandated cuts in energy use.”
违法行为包括马拉维糖业的“纵向垄断 ” 、 肯尼亚化肥业的价格固定，以及津巴布韦棉花业的“买家卡特尔 ” 。	Violations included a “vertical monopoly” in the Malawi sugar sector, price fixing in Kenya’s fertilizer industry, and a “buyer cartel” in the Zimbabwean cotton industry.
受难日协定由英国首相和爱尔兰总理 — — 当时分别是布莱尔和埃亨 — — 在美国参议员乔治·米切尔（George Mitchell）的斡旋下达成。	The Good Friday Agreement was brokered by the prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland – Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, respectively – with the help of United States Senator George Mitchell.
之后的12月初，华尔街日报撰文称培尼亚·涅托的财政部长Luis Videgaray 2012年底就任前也曾从同一家承包商处取得了类似的抵押贷款。	Then, in early December, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Peña Nieto’s finance minister, Luis Videgaray, had also purchased a home in late 2012, just before taking office, from the same contractor, with a similar mortgage.
在富内斯7月1日就职典礼之前的内阁成员人选任命之争中，法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线的保守势力不但夺取了主动，甚至威胁要走上街头进行斗争。	In a showdown over the composition of the cabinet just before his inauguration on June 1, the FMLN old guard won, threatening to take the conflict to the streets.
截止到2010年7月，全球总共有439座核电站投入运作，净装机容量达373.038吉瓦（GW(e ) ， 电力学单位，1吉瓦=10亿瓦）并实现了联网，较2006初又增加了1.2吉瓦。	In July 2010, a total of 439 nuclear power plants with a net installed capacity of 373.038 GW(e) were connected to various national electricity grids, about 1.2 GW(e) more than at the beginning of 2006.
但我们知道，这个孩子进入的是一个面临着不可预料的大变局的世界，不管是环境、经济、地缘政治、技术，还是人口。	We do know that the baby will enter a world of vast and unpredictable change – environmental, economic, geopolitical, technological, and demographic.
进展开始于2007年，当时一批律师针对巴基斯坦第四任军人总统佩尔韦兹·穆沙拉夫撤职最高法院首席法官的违宪裁决发起了大规模抗议运动。	That progress began in 2007, when a group of lawyers initiated a mass protest movement in response to an unconstitutional decision by Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s fourth military president, to suspend the chief justice of the Supreme Court.
也许弗格森的意思是工党与凯恩斯结盟的过去让他们付出了代价 — — 用他的话说，就是“他们在金融危机之前和之中的灾难性治国之道 。 ”	Perhaps Ferguson meant that it was Labour’s past association with Keynes that had damned them – “their disastrous stewardship before and during the financial crisis,” as he puts it.
相反，其政策转变是遏制中国的最后机会，否则中国就将得到在亚洲和其他地区取得地缘政治上风所需要的关键性技术。	On the contrary, its policy shift amounts to its last chance to stop China before it secures the critical technologies it needs to gain the upper hand geopolitically in Asia and beyond.
诚然，我们需要为重要的国际组织建立一种成员制度从而确保它们的架构是合适的，并确保有足够的灵活性允许成员更替。	Clearly, therefore, we need to devise a system of membership for key international organizations that ensures that their structures are relevant but that is also flexible enough to allow members to come and go.
经济学家们倾向于花费部分500亿美元的其他选项还包括为世界饥饿人口提供微观营养、建立自由贸易以及使用蚊帐和药物与霍乱作斗争。	Other options that the economists favored spending some of their $50 billion include providing micro-nutrients to the world’s hungry, establishing free trade, and battling malaria with mosquito nets and medication.
此外，独立也不能为塞尔维亚的公众所接受，他们已经眼睁睁地看着“大塞尔维亚”一点点地在缩小，而最近是黑山共和国分离。	Moreover, independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public, which has already watched in dismay as “Great Serbia” has been gradually whittled away, most recently with the secession of Montenegro.
一些美国人也感谢斯诺登（Edward J. Snowden）揭发国安局，他们认为这刺激了急需的公共思考。	Some Americans are grateful for Edward J. Snowden’s revelations about the NSA, which they believe have stimulated urgently needed public deliberation.
分配问题，包括中产阶级的压力以及因为社会安全网过度伸张而极容易被遗漏的人群的窘境应该得到更好的理解和解决。	Distributional issues, including pressures on the middle class and the predicament of population segments vulnerable to slipping through stretched social safety nets, need to be better understood and addressed.
上个月，一群气候科学家在《美国科学院院刊 》 （ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences）上发表了一份报告，警告地球可能正在变成不适合人类居住的“火炉 ” 。	Last month, a group of climate scientists published a report in the US Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences warning that the planet could be on a path to becoming a “hothouse” that may not be habitable for humans.
从法国大革命到埃及和叙利亚，极端分子一再迫害温和派，采取他们最初联合起来推翻的政府一样的做派和政治。	From the French Revolution to Egypt and Syria, extremists have repeatedly overtaken moderates and then proceeded to mimic the tactics and politics of the government they originally united to overthrow.
事实上，采取强硬立场让她得以在某种程度上粉饰她自己的家族史：在日本殖民统治时期，她的父亲朴成焕曾与日军有过合作。	Indeed, adopting a hardline stance has enabled her to whitewash some inconvenient family history: Her father, the dictator Park Chung-hee, collaborated with the Japanese military while Korea was under colonial rule.
莫迪的胜利以及安倍与日本盟友携手能力的日增有助于深化双边关系，如果中国能够恰当地理解这一点，更有助于形成更大的地区战略均衡。	Modi’s victory and Abe’s increased ability to stand by Japan’s allies can help to forge deeper bilateral ties and, if properly understood by China, foster a greater strategic equilibrium in the region.
与此同时，意大利在欧元引发了长期利率大幅下调、此后十年经济快速增长的情况下，却未能抓住机遇扭转债务状况。	Italy, meanwhile, failed to use the significant windfall from the steep decline in long-term interest rates caused by the introduction of the euro and a decade of rapid economic growth to repair its debt position.
而要确保该便利机制规模足以应对2008—2009年规模的全球流动性事件，IMF需要获得更多资源，不管是通过IMF市场贷款还是其他手段实现。	And to guarantee that the facility is large enough to deal with global liquidity events such as that of 2008-2009, the IMF will need access to more resources, whether via market borrowing by the Fund or other means.
在平稳且渐进式发展的时代，宏观经济模型是政策制定者们的可靠工具，但绿色增长却不属于渐进式变革的范畴。	The macroeconomic models on which policymakers depend are solid tools in times of smooth and incremental evolution, but green growth is not about gradual change.
原因在于 ： “ 经济学家，成为了这么一种团体，他们用具有迷惑力的数学来包装自己，给我们一个美丽的错觉，让我们看不清事情的本质 。 ” 同时，他们提供一个“理想化的经济模型，即市场是完美的，每个参与者都是理性的 。 ”	Krugman’s heavy pounding of Chicago School economics goaded Cochrane, a professor of finance, into some bad-tempered counter-punching on the university’s Web site, much of which consisted of a personal attack on Krugman’s scientific integrity.
这一说法 — — 很奇怪，它们在理应不可协调的意识形态阵营之间，比如自由主义者和新马克思主义者，同样流行 — — 大错特错。	This narrative – which, bizarrely, is equally popular among otherwise irreconcilable ideological adversaries, such as libertarians and neo-Marxists – is patently wrong.
我俯瞰着中央公园，想象着半个世纪前在罗马尼亚北部的一个小镇，一位个子很高，头发灰白的人吟诵着自己的诗作 ， “ 红与黑 ” 。 凝视着脚下的公园，那些斯大林主义时代的诗篇从我脑海中闪过：	I am looking down on Central Park and recall from half-a-century ago in a small town in Northern Romania a tall, white-haired man proclaiming his poem, “The Colors Red and Black.” Gazing over the park, I remember those Stalinist era verses:
法国总统马克龙去年9月在索邦大学发表两场演讲以及今年5月份获颁查理曼欧洲团结奖时都为欧洲的未来提出了明确的愿景。	French President Emmanuel Macron, in two speeches, at the Sorbonne last September, and when he received the Charlemagne Prize for European Unity in May, has articulated a clear vision for Europe’s future.
不过尤其考虑到多米尼加近年来的经济发展在很大程度上反映了海地移民的贡献，因此它必需摒弃政治阶层不少人持有的排外态度。	But it must supersede the exclusivist attitudes held by many members of its political class, particularly given that much of its economic growth in recent years reflects the contribution of Haitian immigration.
由于CDU和SPD在最近的选举中失去了支持，后者更是决定在新的选举周期中成为反对党，因此默克尔需要与小政党组成执政联盟。	Because the CDU and the SPD lost support in the recent election, with the latter deciding to spend the coming electoral term in the opposition, Merkel will need to form a coalition with such parties.
荷兰民粹主义右翼出人意料的弱势和德国执政党基督教民主党（Christian Democrats）的稳健表现说明了相同的现象：一个政治稳定的、自信的新的核心欧洲。	The unexpected weakness of the populist right in the Netherlands and the solid performance of the ruling Christian Democrats in Germany was a reflection of the same phenomenon: a new core Europe that is politically stable and self-confident.
乌尔班纳，伊利诺伊州—3月底，非洲著名科学家、创新者和决策者齐聚卢旺达基加利，为一个日益紧迫的问题展开头脑风暴寻找解决方案：非洲低劣的科学质量。	URBANA, ILLINOIS – In late March, Africa’s leading scientists, innovators, and policymakers met in Kigali, Rwanda, to brainstorm solutions to an increasingly pressing problem: the low quality of science on the continent.
除邻国索马里无休无止的混乱局势外，长期在位的总理梅莱斯·泽纳维是摆在埃塞俄比亚面前最令人生畏的区域挑战。	Besides the never-ending anarchy of neighboring Somalia, the regional challenges facing Ethiopia and its long-serving prime minister, Meles Zenawi, are daunting.
这意味着中国出口商应对特朗普的关税，只需要简单地提高价格即可，而不需要牺牲利润率或将生产转移到美国。	This means that Chinese exporters can respond to Trump’s tariffs simply by raising their prices instead of cutting their profit margins or relocating production to the US.
但更深层次的原因是一种正确的感觉：由此导致的经常项目赤字，如果用短期资本流入即“热”钱融资，便不是“良性”的。	But the deeper reason is the correct perception that the resulting current-account deficits are not “benign” when they are being financed by inflows of short-term capital, or “hot” money.
而且，像在所有地方的经理们一样，他们职责重大，使得他们的地位更为不安稳，而各公司则必须争取相对较少的优秀人才，从而抬高了他们的身价。	Moreover, like managers everywhere, their responsibility is great, making their positions less secure, while companies must compete for the relatively few good ones, driving up their price.
如今危机也正不断逼近欧洲：欧洲央行似乎要将自身以及其他欧洲国家央行的资产负债表盈亏 — — 上面满是爱尔兰，希腊和葡萄牙的债务 — — 凌驾于这些国家民众的福祉之上。	Today, the imminent crisis is in Europe, where the European Central Bank seems to be putting its own balance sheet and those of European banks – loaded with debt from Ireland, Greece, and Portugal – above the well-being of these countries’ citizens.
但尽管中国继续其经济开放，却越来越将注意力转向国内，越来越注重将公民转化为消费者和推动企业采用并推进新技术。	Even as China continues its economic opening, however, it is looking increasingly inward, at its citizens to serve as consumers and at its businesses to adopt and advance new technologies.
在这方面，英国政府一马当先，3月份，财政大臣乔治·奥斯本（George Osborne）承诺投入1.95亿英镑帮助新兴国家开展抗耐药性项目。	On this front, our own government is leading the way, with Chancellor George Osborne pledging in March to allocate £195 million ($307 million) to help emerging countries finance the fight against AMR.
表面上看，俄罗斯的股票估值似乎具有吸引力，但普京对外国人的肆意揉搓让他们退避三舍，而俄罗斯投资者的手里又没有资金。	Overtly, Russian stock valuations look attractive, but by heaping abuse on foreigners, Putin has scared them away, while Russian investors have no money at hand.
调整的重要组成部分是建设基于持续性实质对话的健康、稳定和持续的对华军事关系，增强我们的合作能力，避免任何形式的误解发生。	A key component of the rebalance is a healthy, stable, and continuous military-to-military relationship with China, based on sustained and substantive dialogue that enhances our ability to work together and to avoid any kind of miscalculation.
尽管现在大家还没有就伦理规范达成一致意见，但很多科学家都同意积极的公共卫生系统是防止生物威胁（不管这种威胁是有意造成的，还是无意造成的）最重要的防卫措施。	Although no consensus has yet emerged on a code of ethics, there is wide agreement among scientists that a robust public health system is an essential safeguard against biological threats, whether intentional or unintentional.
解释这种人口趋势其实很简单：全球生育率直线下降，从1950-1955年的每位妇女生5个孩子，下降到2010-2015年的2.5个。	The explanation for this demographic trend is straightforward: global fertility rates have plummeted, from five children per woman, on average, in 1950-1955, to 2.5 children per woman in 2010-2015.
因此，即使高企的失业水平会打击消费、房价、银行资产负债表、对自由贸易的支持以及公共财政，进一步出台刺激政策的空间正变得越来越小。	Thus, even as mounting job losses undermine consumption, housing prices, banks’ balance sheets, support for free trade, and public finances, the room for further policy stimulus is becoming narrower.
更妙的是，我们不需要坐等新发明的出现来落实我们所需要的变化；转型可以立刻开始，由企业提供受市场推动的有利可图的方案。	Better still, we do not need to wait for new inventions to implement the changes we need; the transformation can happen right now, with profitable solutions delivered by businesses and driven by markets.
当外汇互换名义值（1,150亿美元）用完时，可由国际储备覆盖的短期（对外和对内）公共债务的比重将低于100%的临界值。	When the notional value of foreign-exchange swaps ($115 billion) is netted out, the share of short-term public debt (foreign and domestic) covered by international reserves is below the critical threshold of 100%.
阿布都哈米提二世（Sultan Abdulhamit II）在1895-97年间曾组织过大屠杀，但是一直到1915年春天，第一次世界大战前夕，青年土耳其党人的民族主义政府才找到实施一场真正的种族屠杀的政治决心。	Sultan Abdulhamit II organized the massacres of 1895-97 but it was not until the spring of 1915, under the cover of the First World War, that the Young Turks’ nationalistic government found the political will to execute a true genocide.
国际清算银行（BIS）认为答案是否定的，在其2015年年报中指出在重振增长方面“货币政策承担了太多 ” ， 这一现实体现在“极低利率的持久性”中。	The Bank for International Settlements thinks not, arguing in its 2015 annual report that “monetary policy has been overburdened” in an attempt to reinvigorate growth, a reality that is reflected in “the persistence of ultra-low interest rates.”
选民们将以一种痛苦的方式学到威权主义会加剧而非减轻腐败，因为它撤销了对那些拉动权力杠杆者的体制制衡。	Voters will learn the hard way that authoritarianism exacerbates rather than mitigates corruption, because it abolishes checks and balances on those pulling the levers of power.
但俄罗斯特工炮制的假新闻像病毒那样传播，清楚地表明了一件事：缺乏基本公民教育的选民更有可能落入为了煽动党派对立而进行的挑拨。	But the viral spread of fake news stories initiated by Russian agents made one thing clear: an electorate lacking a basic civics education is more likely to fall for provocations designed to inflame partisan tensions.
正如法国总理曼努埃尔·瓦尔斯（Manuel Valls）最近撰文指出，欧洲领导人面临的关键问题是“放弃并坐视欧洲项目走向缓慢但必然的终结”还是“实现欧盟的转型 ” 。	As French Prime Minister Manuel Valls recently wrote, the key question facing Europe’s leaders is whether to “give up and leave the European project to a slow but certain death” or to “transform the EU.”
事实上，2004年大选前人们普遍预测，在连续遭受三次选举失利后，国大党即将迎来第四次失败并最终解散。	Indeed, the uniform prediction prior to the 2004 election was that, after having lost three elections in a row, the Congress was heading for its fourth defeat and eventual dissolution.
多边主义的主力军应该包括澳大利亚、巴西、印度、印尼、墨西哥、新西兰、南非和英国，可能还有中国和日本。	The champions of multilateralism should include Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and possibly China and Japan.
任职总理期间，我领导的政府曾调查俄罗斯乌克兰能源公司，了解谁是它真正的所有者、它采用什么手段获得了对中亚天然气进口的实际控制权、以及利润最终去了哪里。	During my premiership, my government sought to investigate RosUkrEnergo – to discover who precisely its owners are, how it gained a virtual monopoly on the import of Central Asian gas, and where its profits go.
通过重新打包也许可以产生一些钱，但是银行绝对无法通过把次级抵押贷款分割后包装成价值远远超出其实质价值的产品而获利几十亿美元。	There might be some money in repackaging, but not the billions that banks made by slicing and dicing sub-prime mortgages into packages whose value was much greater than their contents.
在许多经济学家看来，衰退是经济周期不可避免的一部分 — — 无论任何繁荣，随后的爆破是必然的，就像痛饮之后的宿醉。	For many economists, recessions are an inevitable part of the business cycle – the bust that necessarily follows, like a hangover, from any boom. John Maynard Keynes, however, had little time for this view.
预算论战并没有就修补美国基础设施���成任何一致，倒是在造成这样的印象：阿富汗和巴基斯坦才是美国的核心国家利益。	The budget war is not producing any consensus on fixing America’s infrastructure, but it is beginning to produce a view that Afghanistan and Pakistan are far from being core US national interests.
事实上，美元相对价格的变化，或者是美元的贬值，都没有达到足以预示国际贸易和消费模式会发生永久性转变的程度。	In fact, there has been no change in relative prices or depreciation of the US dollar of a magnitude that would augur a permanent shift in trade and spending patterns.
但当领导人看到双重标准 — — “我的安全担忧需要核武器，你的不需要 ” — —如此盛行时，他们就会采取一眼对眼的态度。	But bloody-mindedness is a natural and inevitable reaction when leaders see double standards – “my security concerns justify nuclear weapons, but yours do not” – at work on this scale.
这虽然不是什么新闻，但现代通讯确实使NGO的规模急剧扩大，其数量仅在20世纪90年代就从6000个增加到26000个。	This is not entirely new, but modern communications have led to a dramatic increase in scale, with the number of NGO's jumping from 6,000 to approximately 26,000 during the 1990's alone.
法国担心美国对北约的影响太大，并反对北约发挥全球性作用，在该计划中北约与澳大利亚、新西兰、日本及其它国家建立特殊的合作关系。	France is concerned that America’s influence in NATO is too large, and opposes a global role in which NATO establishes special partnerships with Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and other countries.
特朗普的教育部长人选贝西·德沃斯（Betsy DeVos）是一位富豪女继承人，她的履历表上赫然记录着灾难性的密歇根州学校私有化政策。	Trump’s choice for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, is an ultra-wealthy heiress whose résumé includes a disastrous effort to privatize Michigan’s schools.
反之，协议内容局限在回应普遍接受的将二氧化碳排放量限制在百万分之四百五十，以及将全球平均升温幅度控制在2°C以内的目标。 但这样的目标是否现实？	Instead, the agreement limits itself to responding to the widely accepted goal of keeping carbon-dioxide levels below 450 parts per million, and the rise in average global temperature below 2°C. But are these targets realistic?
它也是世界银行最有争议的报告，去年10月《2018年营商环境报告 》 （ Doing Business 2018）发布后，围绕该报告的争议达到了新高度，一些批评指责报告含义模糊，玩弄数据，还受到政治操纵。	It is also the Bank’s most contentious, and with the release of Doing Business 2018 last October, the controversy surrounding the report has reached new heights, with some critics accusing it of obfuscation, data rigging, and political manipulation.
当年，阿根廷依靠半是强迫、半是协商的手段，从20世纪90年代堆积起来的债务大山下脱身，实际上强行剥夺了外国债主的权益，而后者则被视作危险和邪恶的化身。	Argentina then used a mixture of coercion and negotiation to get out from under the mountain of debt that it incurred in the 1990’s, effectively expropriating foreign creditors, who were viewed as dangerous and malign.
一个机构对全球宏观经济趋势施加了如此之大的影响，这引起了大规模的不安，末日预言家纷纷表示对美国债务可持续性的怀疑将迫使美国甩卖其持有的美国债务。	The fact that a single institution wields so much influence over global macroeconomic trends has caused considerable anxiety, with doomsayers predicting that doubts about US debt sustainability will force China to sell off its holdings of US debt.
正当各政党争得不可开交之时，贾南德拉国王接替他被谋杀的兄长，在2002年罢黜总理，通过一个任命内阁进行统治。	As political parties bickered, King Gyanendra, who succeeded his murdered brother, sacked the prime minister in 2002 and ruled through an appointed cabinet.
这使德国与其他欧元区大国相比在国际市场上的竞争力有所提高，后者一直默不作声，既没有改革生产率，也没有采取其他相应措施。	This allowed Germany to improve its competitive position in world markets vis-à-vis the other large euro-zone economies, where there were no productivity revolutions, silent or otherwise.
但是九月份加息也符合萨尔科奇的利益，因为这会给他以口实，将欧洲央行描绘成为失控以及需要加以政治约束。	But a September rate move also serves Sarkozy’s interests, as it will give him more ammunition to portray the ECB as out of control and in need of political disciplining.
世俗派指出其他伊斯兰正义和发展党的成员也有这种担心，比如议长阿林克，后者以其公开宣称的宗教和社会保守主义而著称。	Secularists point with concern to other AKP, such as Speaker of the Parliament Bulent Arinc, who are noted for their pronounced religious and social conservatism.
大体上，弗里德曼和施瓦茨被视为在指责美联储没能迅速地对接二连三的银行倒闭潮 — — 第一波在1930年末，接着在1931和1933年两度再次发生 — — 做出反应。	Friedman and Schwartz are generally seen as reproving the Fed for failing to react swiftly to successive waves of bank failures, first in late 1930 and then again in 1931 and 1933.
似乎没有东西曾经让他比4月9日联邦调查局反常搜擦迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen，他的个人法务主管和残局收拾人）的办公室、住所和饭店房间更加愤怒。	It seems that nothing has made him angrier than the FBI’s extraordinary April 9 raid on the office, home, and hotel room of Michael Cohen, his principal personal attorney and fixer.
他和共和党让美国公众的极化程度急剧升高，可能输掉2018年的中期选举和2020年总统竞选；甚至有可能导致他本人被弹劾。	By polarizing the American public to such an extent, he and the Republicans could suffer defeat in the 2018 midterm elections or in the 2020 presidential election; and he could even expose himself to the risk of impeachment.
但我们可以在一系列领域为公众提供更准确的信息，使人们能开始做出更加明智的消费选择和政治决策，从而增进上述平衡的健康度。	But we could certainly begin to strike a healthier balance than the one we have by giving the public far better information across a range of platforms, so that people could begin to make more informed consumption choices and political decisions.
与罗斯福相反，杜鲁门一开始被认为是一位平庸的总统，这位密苏里州男装店主只不过恰好在罗斯福逝世时身为副总统，于是得以继任总统。	In contrast to FDR, Truman was initially considered a mediocre president, a haberdasher from Missouri who just happened to be the vice president who succeeded FDR after his death.
美国最高法院法官安东宁·斯卡利亚（Antonin Scalia）之子尤金·斯卡利亚（Eugene Scalia）说，这项针对SEC的诉讼已经在技术上赢得了美国华盛顿特区巡回法院上诉庭的胜诉 — — SEC没有事先做好成本-效益分析。	Argued by Eugene Scalia, the son of US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the case against the SEC was won in the US Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, on a technicality – the SEC’s failure to conduct a cost-benefit analysis ahead of time.
虽然全球根除脊髓灰质炎行动一直持续开展，但应对上述持续爆发的病例非常吃力，而且也未能彻底完成根除脊髓灰质炎的任务。	The effort to tackle these lingering cases is laborious, and it remains incomplete, despite PHEIC status.
欧元区是一个独特的货币区：其央行缺少一个支持其决定的国家，而其成员国缺少一个在困难时期支持它们的央行。	The eurozone is unique among currency areas: Its central bank lacks a state to support its decisions, while its member states lack a central bank to support them in difficult times.
其四，法律往往无法得到彻底执行，伊斯兰教法又经常凌驾于民法之上，使得那些针对妇女的暴力或罪行得以逍遥法外。	Fourth, laws are often arbitrarily applied, and sharia (Islamic law) frequently takes precedence over civil legislation, resulting in widespread impunity for crimes of violence against women.
欧洲足球俱乐部不仅捐赠资金，还采取具体措施制造欢迎氛围，像打出欢迎横幅、开办难民训练营，拜仁慕尼黑还为难民开设语言课。	Football clubs across Europe are not only donating money, but also taking concrete steps to encourage a welcoming atmosphere, with welcome banners, training camps for refugees, and, in the case of Bayern Munich, language lessons.
那些认为特朗普内阁中的“成年人 ” — —包括凯利、国防部长吉姆·马蒂斯和国家安全顾问麦克马斯特 — — 能够确保美国安全战略处于理性限度之内的人现在可能需要重新考虑。	Those who thought that the “grownups” in Trump’s administration – Kelly, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster – would keep US security strategy within the bounds of reason might need to think again.
牛津大学的最新研究发现，从中国到英国，面临经济困境的人，即使他只是儿童，也会经历几乎相同的对骄傲和自尊的打击。	Recent research conducted at the University of Oxford found that from China to the United Kingdom, people facing economic hardship – even children – experience a nearly identical assault on their pride and self-esteem.
新闻媒体执着于新纪录的倾向让它们总是短视地创造某些真正重要的事情正在发生的印象，因此读者或评论者必须予以关注。	The news media’s tendency to fixate on new records serves their short-term interest in creating the impression that something really important has happened that justifies readers’ or viewers’ attention.
正如Facebook在磕磕碰碰中教会了人们私隐控制那样，市场经营者们也应该用一种更为优雅的方式教育人们何为数据跟踪控制。	Just as Facebook has educated people, clumsily, about privacy controls, so marketers must educate people, ideally more elegantly, about tracking controls.
比如，显然过去十年财富不平等性的恶化程度远甚于收入不平等性，城市住房价格的迅速上涨在其中扮演了核心角色。	For example, it is clear that wealth inequality has increased much more than income inequality over the past decade, with the rapid rise in urban housing prices playing a central role.
在时间苦短矛盾众多的情况下，过渡委员会必须把注意力集中在少数几个能在权力移交之前完成的关键事务之上。	With the NTC confronting so many dilemmas with so little time, it must concentrate on a small number of key issues that can be resolved before it hands over power.
伊斯兰教法 — — 其中最极端者坚持认定在西方早已不是犯罪的行为 — — 比如通奸和同性恋 — — 应该处以死刑 — — 影响着地方规范。	Sharia religious law – extreme versions of which hold that conduct decriminalized in the West, such as adultery and homosexuality, is punishable by death – influences their legal codes.
当海外抗议者反对越南战争时，他们经常唱的就是《我们一定会胜利 》 （ We Shall Overcome）这首美国民权运动之歌。	When protesters overseas were marching against the Vietnam War, they often sang “We Shall Overcome,” the anthem of the US civil rights movement.
军方拥有航空公司和货运公司、石油化工厂、发电厂、糖厂、水泥和化肥厂、建筑公司、银行和保险公司、广告公司及其他各种企业。	The military owns airlines and freight companies, petrochemical factories, power generation plants, sugar mills, cement and fertilizer plants, construction firms, banks and insurance companies, advertising agencies, and more.
议会表明其权威的结果将会是巨大的。 议会批准不仅仅是给一场宫廷政变提供一个橡皮图章；其批准是有条件的。	The consequences of this assertion of parliamentary authority will be enormous. Parliamentary ratification did not simply provide a rubber stamp to a palace coup; its approval was conditional.
从根本上说，即使他们和白芝浩观点一致，也没有银行家不认为市场信心要求他们拿出更坚实的资本基础来吸引批发融资和满足监管者更严厉的要求。	Even if, at heart, they take the Bagehot view, all bankers recognize that market confidence requires them to demonstrate a more solid capital base to attract wholesale funding, as well as to satisfy the stricter demands of regulators.
在2008年美国总统大选上，媒体告诉我们奥巴马之所以获胜是因为他有“魅力 ” — —某种能激发迷恋和忠诚的特殊力量。	In the 2008 US presidential election, the press told us that Obama won because he had “charisma” – the special power to inspire fascination and loyalty.
这种人（其中很少有女性）在绝大多数社会都被对纳粹和法西斯恐怖的集体记忆压制在边缘地带，拥有穷街陋巷色情影院中年顾客肮脏猥琐的气场。	Driven to the margins of most societies by collective memories of Nazi and fascist horrors, such men (there were hardly any women) had the grubby air of middle-aged patrons of backstreet porno cinemas.
菲兹—7月，伊拉克总理阿巴迪宣布伊斯兰国已经被逐出伊拉克第二大城市摩苏尔。 伊斯兰国占领摩苏尔长达三年。	FEZ – In July, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced that the Islamic State (ISIS) had been driven out of Mosul, the country’s second-largest city, which it captured three years ago.
一位21世纪的渔民肯定不愿看到自己的生存基础遭到削弱和破坏，而另一方面现代环保主义者也不愿意将环境圈起来，不让人们赖以维持生活。	Surely a twenty-first-century fisherman does not want to see the basis of his or her living degraded and destroyed, nor does a modern conservationist want to ring-fence the environment and stop people from making a living.
推动中国数字经济取得如此瞩目进步的是阿里巴巴、百度和腾讯等互联网巨头，这些巨头正在大规模地将其服务商业化，为全球带来新的商业模式。	Powering China’s impressive progress in the digital economy are Internet giants like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent, which are commercializing their services on a massive scale, and bringing new business models to the world.
传统凯恩斯主义摩擦（比如难以降低某些行业的工资和福利）以及非传统摩擦（比如当你无法卖掉（或买到）房子时就没办法搬家）或许也起着同样重要的作用	Traditional Keynesian frictions like the difficulty of reducing wages and benefits in some industries, as well as non-traditional frictions like the difficulty of moving when one cannot sell (or buy) a house, may share blame.
美国必须改革其税法，以期从更多的人和更广的经济活动中征收更多的收入（一半美国人口不用缴纳联邦所得税，现行税法要么将多种收入源排除在纳税范围外，要么给予了税收优惠 ） 。	America must reform its tax code to raise revenue across a wider array of people and economic activity (half the US population pays no federal income tax, and the tax code either excludes or favorably treats many income sources).
戈尔巴乔夫实际上只是恢复一种历史悠久的趋向。 在此之前我们俄罗斯人再次相信人民为了成就国家的伟大应该愿意放弃他们的自由，这个国家赢得了战争并发射了人造地球卫星。	As before the advent of Gorbachev – indeed, restoring a centuries-old tendency – Russians yet again believe that the people should be willing to forfeit their freedoms for the sake of the greatness of the state, which wins wars and launches Sputniks.
这些战斗人员中就有阿贝迪的父亲、与基地组织有关联的利比亚伊斯兰战斗组织（Libyan Islamic Fighting Group）的老牌成员。 该组织机要人员在卡扎菲执政期间纷纷被抓获被迫流亡。	Among those fighters was Abedi’s father, a longtime member of the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, whose functionaries were imprisoned or forced into exile during Qaddafi’s rule.
有人甚至预测，尽管需要捍卫的席位数远超共和党，但民主党人将掀起一股同时夺回参议院控制权的“蓝色狂潮 ” 。	And some even foresee a “blue wave” in which Democrats also retake the Senate, despite having to defend far more seats than the Republicans.
他们被排斥在学校门外，被机会所抛弃，被迫生活在无法忍受的条件下 — — 可能沦为劳工或被迫乞讨，卖走当新娘、遭遇人贩、被黑帮吸收，或被恐怖分子招募。	They are shut out of schools, locked out of opportunity, and condemned to live in unbearable conditions – subject to child labor or forced begging, sold into marriage, trafficked, conscripted into gangs, or recruited by extremists.
它也令美国人害怕，美国人直到最近都认为 — — 也许是希望 — — 他们生活在一个基于华盛顿、林肯和两位罗斯福所建立的传统的共和国中。	And it is frightening to Americans, who until recently believed – or perhaps hoped – that they were living in a republic based on the traditions established by George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt.
官方对相关新闻的封锁（该事件就发生在北京奥运会之前）不仅导致了许多婴儿的死亡，也令中国老百姓更加不相信政府。	Official suppression of news about the incident (which occurred just before the Beijing Olympics) not only led to the deaths of many infants, but also left ordinary Chinese even more distrustful of the authorities.
作为微软预感计划（Project Premonition）研究的一部分，这一陷阱原型使用红外线光束来识别特定的蚊子物种并具备超过80%的准确性。	Part of Microsoft’s Project Premonition research initiative, the prototype trap uses an infrared light beam to identify specific mosquito species with more than 80% accuracy.
美国正在努力遏制特朗普政府极端主义的正常化 — — 无论是针对穆斯林的旅行禁令，无视科学事实的环境政策，还是忽视国际贸易承诺的威胁。	The US is struggling to prevent the Trump administration’s extremism – whether it’s a travel ban aimed at Muslims, science-denying environmental policies, or threats to ignore international trade commitments – from being normalized.
最后所采取的办法，当时被认为是卓有成效的，因为拉美各大债务国没有一个出现正式违约的情况（只是巴西于5年后，也就是1987年，曾短暂出现过违约 ） 。	The solution that was eventually adopted was considered brilliant at the time, because it avoided formal default by any of the big Latin American borrowers (though Brazil briefly defaulted five years later, in 1987).
在2007年7月，另一支富有的阿联酋基金 ， “ 迪拜国际资本”买下了EADS 3%的股份。 而此前该基金已于2006年1月买下了汽车生产商戴姆勒公司近2%的股份。	In July 2007, another rich UAE fund, Dubai International Capital, bought 3% of EADS, after taking a stake of almost 2% in the automotive manufacturer Daimler in January 2006.
在工业国家，扩张性预算，加上低利率和资产价格的升高，产生了消费或信贷推动的增长，特别是在讲英语的国家。	In the industrial countries, expansionary budgets, coupled with low interest rates and elevated asset prices, has led to consumption- or credit-fueled growth, particularly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
容易利用人的人表现出冷酷、难以相处、善于欺骗、自我中心、诚实和谦卑缺失、以及过度关注个人才能和目标等若干特质。	Subjects prone to exploiting others demonstrated a number of characteristics, including callousness, disagreeableness, deceitfulness, egocentrism, lack of honesty or humility, and an excessive interest in one’s personal talents and goals.
在这么一个通常被描绘为发展日新月异和高度强调“稳定”的国家，是什么在诱发这些不安定因素呢？ 原因是：拖欠工资和养老金；突然和大量地终止劳动合同；造成一些工业企业破产的腐败官员；以及绝大多数从1950年代共产党政权早期就一直得以保证的社会主义权益的终结。	The incidents loom substantially more dangerous to the political elite if they seem to have been mobilized by dissidents, are marked by some measure of violence, threaten to spread, or entail the obstruction of major transport trunklines.
我坚信欧盟的新成员不会忘记自己曾经有过的极权主义和以非暴力方式对抗罪恶的经历，而他们在欧盟团体内的处事方式会体现出他们的上述经历。	I firmly believe that the new members of the EU will not forget their experience of totalitarianism and non-violent opposition to evil, and that that experience will be reflected in how they behave in EU bodies.
在英国，政府刚刚通过法律，要求英国所有海外领地 — — 同时也是黑金臭名昭著的避险天堂 — — 到2020年底公开其注册企业的真正所有者。	In the United Kingdom, the government has just adopted rules requiring that all British overseas territories – notorious havens for dark money – publicly list the real owners of registered companies by the end of 2020.
香港的按揭利率很低，但也没有低到零利率的程度，这意味着，中位收入家庭如果无法获得来自（比如）父母的资助，或者移民购房者如果无法获得海外资金的资助，几乎不可能买得起房。	Mortgage rates are low in Hong Kong, but not zero, suggesting it is just about impossible for a median-income household to purchase a home there without access to additional funds from, say, a parent, or, if the buyer is an immigrant, from abroad.
但是，尽管多样化的经济是私人企业赢得更大空间的先决条件，但中东各国政府，特别是在荣景时期，总是偏袒政治关系强的企业，阻挠它们视之为威胁的企业。	But, while a diversified economy presupposes more space for private enterprise, governments in the region, especially during boom times, have tended to favor politically connected firms, and blocked those they view as a threat.
我们这些仍然主要依靠农业的国家，很大一部分领土位于低地势沿海地区，很��易受到海平面上升和极端天气影响。	Our still largely agrarian countries, with much of their territory in low-lying coastal regions, are dangerously exposed to rising sea levels and violent weather.
我们也希望其他国家，无论在欧洲还是亚洲，都应该加入，一同协助实现通过改善基础设施来提高其他地区生活水平的宏图壮志，正如中国所展现的那样。	One hopes that other countries, both in Europe and Asia, will join as well, helping to fulfill the ambition that infrastructure improvements can raise living standards in other parts of the region, as they have already done in China.
美国应该争取尽可能多的国家的合作，使用武力消灭叙利亚的固定翼飞机，以此作为实施2139号决议的第一步。	The US, together with as many countries as will cooperate, could use force to eliminate Syria’s fixed-wing aircraft as a first step toward enforcing Resolution 2139.
的确，任何阿拉伯人 — — 事实上，几乎每个人 — — 都清楚地知道谁应对哈肖吉的失踪负责：沙特阿拉伯的王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼。	True, any Arab – indeed, virtually everyone – knows exactly who is responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.
法国制度的捍卫者用劳动力成本统计数字为依据为这一行为开脱，以证明法国于其主要欧洲贸易伙伴并没有什么区别。	Defenders of the French system quibble over labor-cost statistics in their efforts to prove that France is not so different from its main European trading partners.
所以当她一再坚持说自己不会在下一个任期到期日（2020年）之前举行大选，人们立刻毫无保留地相信了她。	So when she insisted, repeatedly, that she would not hold an election before the next due date, in 2020, she was believed unreservedly.
倘若默克尔不是那么着迷于对欧洲高负债国家采取紧缩政策，又如果她能说服自己的选民们接受另一种措施的话，欧元区的危机将都会以一种截然不同的形式发展。	Had Merkel been less enamored of austerity for Europe’s debt-distressed countries, and had she managed to convince her domestic electorate of the need for a different approach, the eurozone crisis would have played out quite differently.
显然，尽管许多非洲人从政治解放中获益 — — 这是尼雷尔这一代人留下的遗产 — — 但贫困仍然是一个巨大的障碍。	It is obvious that while many Africans have benefited from political emancipation – the legacy of Nyerere’s generation – poverty remains a significant obstacle.
也许最重要的是，科学方法在潜移默化中树立思维习惯 — — 追求真理、知识和好政府 — — 这些思维习惯不但天生具有极高的价值，也是二十一世纪经济进步的基础。	Perhaps most important, the scientific method instills habits of mind – the pursuit of truth, knowledge, and good government – that are not only intrinsically valuable, but also essential for twenty-first-century economic progress.
在最近的一项麦肯锡调查中，许多全球性企业都反馈说只有不到1/3的核心业务、产品和服务实现了自动化或数字化。	In a recent McKinsey survey, global firms reported that less than a third of their core operations, products, and services were automated or digitized.
但是，只要巴沙尔的军队能够调用直升机和固定翼飞机袭击反对派控制的社区，反对派就很难通过现在能够搞到的武器推翻巴沙尔政权。	Yet, as long as Assad’s forces can attack opposition-controlled neighborhoods with helicopters and fixed-wing airplanes, the opposition’s ability to overthrow the regime with the arms that are now available to it seems questionable.
其实，相比于对欧洲造成重大破坏的国外资本出逃，目前丝毫不乏自愿掏钱的日债买主，从而推动利率达到历史最低水平。	Indeed, in contrast to the foreign capital flight that has so damaged Europe, willing foreign buyers of JGBs are currently plentiful, pushing interest rates to their lowest levels ever.
在瑞士，2004年相当多数选民决定批准干细胞研究法，该法就如何在研究过程中对人类胚胎干细胞进行制造和应用做出了规定。	In Switzerland, a substantial majority of voters decided in 2004 to ratify the Stem Cell Research Act, which regulates how human embryonic stem cells are produced and used in research.
什么政策可以被提上政府日程并非由经济学决定，但在预算赤字问题上的误解正在被人向党派和意识形态之争引导。	What stands in the way of this agenda is not economics, but misconceptions about budget deficits that are being exploited for partisan and ideological purposes.
可我们都知道这些国家和它们的央行有能力在数月之内耗费数万亿美元的巨资来救助它们在经济运行平稳时赚取了超额利润的银行。	But we all know that these countries and their national banks were able to spend trillions of dollars in a few months to bail out their bankers, who earned super-profits when the going was good.
没有了沙龙，佩雷茨可能在联合政府中具有更大的力量，特别是奥尔莫特比沙龙更愿意采纳被人感觉是鸽派的政策变化。	Without Sharon, Peretz might have more leverage in the partnership, particularly since Olmert has been more willing than Sharon to embrace policy changes perceived as dovish.
因此，世界野生动物基金指出，我们所使用的已经超出了地球所能提供资源的30 ％ ， 而且情况还会变得更糟。	So the WWF points out that we are already living beyond Earth’s means, using around 30% too much. And it will get worse.
那些因扩展业务而需招聘人才的企业无法做到这样，是因为金融资产的价格下降的普遍水平让它们无法按照有利可图的条款从外界获得贷款或售出自己的债券。	Businesses that ought to be expanding and hiring cannot, because the depressed general level of financial asset prices prevents them from borrowing money or selling bonds on profitable terms.
然而该国花了18年的时间来迷惑监督机构“国际原子能组织”派出的调查员，以致有的国家认为伊朗已经自毁信誉，放弃了在本国土地上发展铀浓缩的权利。	But it spent 18 years deceiving inspectors from the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency, leading some countries to argue that Iran destroyed its credibility and forfeited its rights to enrichment on its own soil.
2008年一项研究发现，一个国家的教育体系质量 — — 以及毕业生的认知能力 — — 与其经济增长是高度正相关的。	One study from 2008 found that the quality of a country’s education system – and the cognitive abilities of its graduates – positively influences economic growth.
欧洲和美国在立法禁止本国企业贿赂外国政府官员，以换取采矿特许权或其他利益的问题上行动迟缓，对规则的执行力度也非常有限。	Europe and America were slow to enact legislation barring their companies from bribing foreign government officials in return for mining concessions or other advantages, and there has been limited enforcement of the rules.
如今，这一感叹也可用于描述当前的全球经济 — — 只不过现在如何变绿（转变为绿色经济）才是问题所在。	Today, this sentiment is surprisingly relevant to the global economy – only it is becoming green that is the problem.
2015年9月我首次发表了对难民危机的看法，随着时间的推移，这些看法不断修正，因为事实已经发生了变化。	I first published my ideas on the refugee crisis in September 2015, and I have revised them over time, as the facts on the ground have changed.
自由的市场经济和法律传统对于金融中心的生存不可或缺，当然帮助它们崛起，但是最初的崛起总是历史演变，而不是政府的战略打造出来的。	A free-market economy and its legal traditions -- both indispensable to the survival of financial centers – certainly helps them to rise, but that initial rise has always been attributable to historical evolution, not government strategy.
现在，乌克兰人民也许也面临着相同的考验，如果这场国家总统选举的合法获胜者维克托·尤申科成为总统的话，维克托·亚努科维奇的支持者们就威胁要谋求自治。	Now Ukraine’s people may face a similar test after supporters of Viktor Yanukovych threatened to seek autonomy should the rightful winner of the country’s presidential vote, Viktor Yushchenko, actually become president.
由于伊朗领导人们总是扬言要把以色列从地图上抹去并要反抗美国（艾哈迈迪内贾德在去投票的路上踩过一张美国国旗的照片 ） ， 对抗的风险已经增加了。	Since Iranian leaders daily proclaim their desire to wipe Israel off the map and to fight the US (Ahmadinejad stepped on a picture of an American flag on his way to vote), the risk of confrontation has increased.
特朗普利用了美国长期存在的一定程度的种族主义和本土论：他宣誓要设法围剿和驱逐大约1,100万非法留美外国人，在美墨边境建立一道墙 — — 由墨西哥买单。	Trump plays to America’s persistent veins of racism and nativism: he vows somehow to round up and deport some 11 million undocumented aliens and fortify America’s border with Mexico by building a wall – paid for by Mexico.
借助LTE移动基础设施，智能手机成就了第一个内容推送平台，只要你醒着，就可以使用它，这改变了科技行业和二十亿用户的生活。	Smartphones with LTE mobile infrastructure created the first content-delivery platform that was available every waking moment, transforming the technology industry and the lives of two billion users.
在进攻格鲁吉亚的那一周之内，俄罗斯就出现了160亿美元的资本外流，自那时起外流总额已高达300亿美金。	Within a week of its attack on Georgia, Russia recorded a capital outflow of $16 billion, which has since increased to $30 billion.
拜茶党僵化的意识形态所赐，尽管美国政府偿还其债务的法定能力一切正常，但对峙和边缘政策已经成为美国政坛的新暗语了。	Confrontation and brinkmanship have become the new watchwords of American politics, even when the US government’s legal ability to pay its debts is on the line, owing to the Tea Party’s ideological rigidity.
但叙利亚的例子表明，军事力量可以是决定性的 - 特别是在大规模使用，毫不顾忌平民伤亡或流离失所之时。	But Syria shows that military force can be decisive – especially when applied in massive doses, with little concern for the number of civilians killed or displaced.
逊尼派阿拉伯人和库尔德人都对马利基对于伊朗最近轰炸伊拉克领土的行动 — — 以便打击通过越境逃到伊拉克境内的一支伊朗库尔德人武装力量 — — 所作出的温和反应深表不满。	Both Sunni Arabs and Kurds already resent al Maliki’s mild reaction to Iran’s recent shelling of Iraqi territory – an attempt to strike at Iranian Kurdish militants fleeing across its border with Iraq.
左翼工党的佩雷茨是一个民粹主义者和工会联合会领导人，几乎没有什么全国性的领导经验，甚至在安全问题上更为生疏。	On the left is Amir Peretz of the Labor party, a populist and trade-union federation leader with little national leadership experience and even less familiarity with security matters.
极左翼说特朗普和克林顿或奥巴马的区别只是程度上，而非类型上，他只是比他们将新自由主义的恶的一面更加赤裸裸地展现出来。	And so is talk on the far left that the difference between Trump and Clinton or Obama is one of degree, not kind: he merely displays the iniquities of neoliberalism more blatantly than they did.
作为一项妥协性的宪政安排 ， 《 里斯本条约》无法在哥本哈根这类处理世界事务的场合给予欧盟更多 合适的 权重和权威。	The Lisbon Treaty was a compromise constitutional arrangement that would nevertheless give the EU greater weight and authority precisely for occasions such as the Copenhagen summit, when global issues are addressed.
在民主党方面，前国务卿希拉里·克林顿可能获得提名（尽管最新曝光表明她使用个人电子邮件账户处理公事 ） ， 这进一步加强了外交政策在大选中的关键性。	As for the Democrats, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's likely nomination (despite recent revelations that she used her personal email account to conduct government business) reinforces foreign policy's centrality to the election.
此外，按中国社会科学院一项研究测算，中央和地方政府所积累的净资产达到了GDP的近146 % ， 其中大部分为房地产和基础设施。	In addition, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that the central and local governments have accumulated net assets amounting to nearly 146% of GDP, mostly in real estate.
金辰勇是公共卫生专家，现任达特茅斯大学校长，此前曾担任过世界卫生组织艾滋病部门。 这是一个相当好的候选人。	In Kim, a public-health professor who is now President of Dartmouth College and previously led the World Health Organization’s HIV/AIDS department, the United States has put forward a good candidate.
比如在迁移到亚洲和其他较低成本地区之前，一度高度集中于美国新英格兰地区的纺织品生产就曾大量转移到南部地区。	For example, US textile production, once heavily concentrated in New England, shifted mainly to the South (before relocating to Asia and other lower-cost locales).
地球已经走过了4,500万个世纪，但我们这个世纪是独一无二的，因为这是第一个某个物种能够彻底摧毁其自身生存基础的世纪。	The Earth is 45 million centuries old, but our century is unique, because it is the first in which a species could destroy the entire basis of its own existence.
因为每年亏损45亿美元补贴客运票价，政府用于升级基础设施、改善安全标准或提高运行速度的资金已经极其匮乏。	With the government losing $4.5 billion every year by subsidizing passenger fares, it has little money to spend on upgrading infrastructure, improving safety standards, or speeding up the trains.
该报告警告，如果任由全球平均温度超过前工业化水平1.5℃ — — 或者在最差情况下，2℃，那么，极有可能带来灾难性的后果，而且这些后果最早在2040年就能被感受到。	It warns that if average global temperatures are allowed to exceed 1.5°C – or, at worst, 2°C – above pre-industrial levels, the consequences could be catastrophic, and they will be felt as soon as 2040.
当按揭债务高水平遇上房价崩盘时，就会引起巨大的社会和经济成本，因此，监管者理应对这一问题全力以赴、密切关注。	Given the enormous social and economic costs when high levels of mortgage debt meet a crash in house prices, one would expect regulators to be fully engaged on the issue.
相反，美联储在前任主席耶伦（Janet Yellen ） 、 英格兰银行在卡尼（Mark Carney）的领导下，一直在为政策“正常化”奠基。	By contrast, the US Federal Reserve, beginning under former Chair Janet Yellen, and the Bank of England, under Mark Carney, have been laying the groundwork for policy “normalization.”
而在哥本哈根发生的一切都暴露出一个问题，那就是欧盟不仅算不上世界强权，甚至连当个国际调停人都不够格。	Copenhagen exposed the demise of Europe not only as a global power, but even as a global arbiter.
但据英国历史学家安德鲁·派特里（Andrew Pettegree）介绍，自1517年到1546年路德逝世之间，当地的出版商“最少出版了2721部著作 ” ， 相当于“每年平均出版91本书 ” ， 总印量达300万册。	But, according to the British historian Andrew Pettegree, between 1517 and Luther’s death in 1546, local publishers “turned out at least 2,721 works” – and average of “91 books per year,” representing some three million individual copies.
这与新加坡的根本不同，因为并不要求雇主这样做。 参加计划的雇员的工资不经其同意就可以抵扣，他们可以自己要求退出计划。	This differs fundamentally from Singapore’s scheme, since employers are not required to do so, and, while enrolled employees’ paychecks are deducted without their consent, they can drop out of the plan at their own request.
一个是全民健康覆盖联合学习网络（Joint Learning Network for Universal Health Coverage ） ， 这是一个发展成果组织（Results for Development）和其他发展伙伴支持下的来自30个国家的实践者和决策者社区。	One is the Joint Learning Network for Universal Health Coverage (JLN), a community of practitioners and policymakers from 30 countries supported by Results for Development and other development partners.
东地中海艳阳高照的气候吸引着源源不断的旅游者，而南部的欧盟成员地位已经把希腊塞浦路斯人的收入水平推到比欧盟的平均水平还高。	The sunny climate of the eastern Mediterranean draws a steady stream of tourists, and European Union membership in the south has pushed income levels for Greek Cypriots higher than the EU average.
鉴于这个国际货币基金组织用来跟踪自身金融交易的特别提款权其实并没有什么重要性，中国当局将人民币往里面塞的努力也更多就是摆个花架子而��。	Given that the SDR, which the IMF uses to keep track of its own financial transactions, is of little practical importance, the Chinese authorities’ effort to add the renminbi to it amounts to little more than a vanity project.
此类众议院席位很容易在2018年倒向民主党人，如果敏这样的候选人可以说服选民沃尔特斯并未倾听民意 — — 而且与特朗普过于亲密。	This kind of House seat can easily flip to the Democrats in 2018, if a candidate like Min can persuade voters that Walters is out of touch – and too close to Trump.
一个完美的例子是2008年全球金融危机，当时金融市场因运行混乱以及支付和结算系统失去互信而陷入了困境。	A perfect example is the 2008 global financial crisis, when financial markets seized up as a result of operational dislocations and a loss of mutual confidence in the payments and settlement system.
相反，莫迪政府计划追求亲增长日程，包括减��官僚拖延、增加基础设施投资、刺激制造业活动、向统一的简化税收制度转型等。	By contrast, the Modi government plans to pursue a pro-growth agenda that includes reducing bureaucratic delays, increasing infrastructure investment, stimulating manufacturing activity, and shifting to a simpler unified tax system.
即便中国的货币总供应量看似超额（M2-GDP比率目前达到了190 % ） ，真正的货币基数却比看上去要小。	Thus, although China’s total money supply seems excessive, with the M2-to-GDP ratio now at about 190%, the real monetary base is actually much smaller than it appears.
在一度沉迷于似乎无穷无尽的, 建立在2008-2009年间深度危机之中的超级宽松货币政策之后，金融市场如今已是苟延残喘。	Addicted to an open-ended strain of über monetary accommodation that was established in the depths of the Great Crisis of 2008-2009, financial markets are now gasping for breath.
2011—2015年，政府已经投入2,860亿美元用于可再生能源开发，3,760亿美元用于能源保护工程。	The government has already pledged $286 billion to renewable-energy development and $376 billion to energy-conservation projects in 2011-2015.
事实上，孟克平均每年花六天时间 — — 六年来总共花了36天左右 — — 访问这些村庄，访问期通常为2—3天。	Munk spent an average of around six days per year – around 36 days over six years – actually visiting the villages, and usually at a stretch of 2-3 days.
雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安总统领导下的土耳其曾经为运行顺畅的民主制度感到骄傲，但现在也已滑向专制统治。	Under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s leadership, Turkey, which once boasted a functioning democratic system, has been slipping toward authoritarian rule.
而这一局面同样要归因于美国和以色列的顽固 — — 即它们拒绝接受哈马斯在2006年选举中获胜、承认其为合法的巴勒斯坦代表组织。	This, too, is rooted in American and Israeli intransigence – specifically, their refusal to accept Hamas’s victory in the 2006 election and recognize the group as the legitimate Palestinian representative.
比如在2008年，一个名叫旺度，原本在拉萨进行艾滋病防治教育工作的西藏人就被判处了终身监禁，因为他向海外的西藏人传播西藏暴动的消息。	In 2008, for example, a Tibetan named Wangdu, an AIDS educator in Lhasa, received a life sentence for sending news about Tibetan protests to Tibetans abroad.
从阿根廷的经验看，巴西的支出上限看上去也很有问题 — — 特别是考虑到可预见的未来政治动荡仍将持续的情况。	Viewed with Argentina’s experience in mind, Brazil’s spending cap looks problematic – all the more so against a backdrop of political turmoil that is set to continue for the foreseeable future.
作为二战后最伟大的美国外交官之一的乔治·凯南曾经写道,西方社会在50年来犯得最大的一个错误就是，在前苏联共产政权倒台之后，北约还继续东扩。	George Kennan, one of the greatest American diplomats of the post-war years, once wrote that the Western world was committing its biggest mistake in 50 years time by expanding NATO after Soviet communism collapsed.
共产主义的崩溃释放出一股巨大的人类能量，但它的起点却是特权和资产在老的“精英阶层（nomenklatura ） ” 内部以一种古怪和愤世嫉俗的方式转移，以及一种新的普遍的达尔文主义者的挣扎。	Communism’s fall unleashed a huge surge of human energy, but this started with a bizarre and cynical transfer of privileges and assets within the old “nomenklatura,” and with a new general Darwinian struggle.
这一内在矛盾在世界银行的最初几十年里并不成为问题，因为ICSID本身并未形成气候，1966—1996年间总共只有38个注册案件。	This internal fissure was a non-issue during the World Bank’s first decades, when the ICSID itself was a non-factor, with only 38 registered cases between 1966 and 1996.
佛山市政府在20世纪80年代初便是第一批试点乡镇企业和民营经济的地方政府之一，在培养民营企业方面起到了重要的领头作用。	Foshan’s municipal government, which was among the first to experiment with township and village enterprises and privatization in the early 1980s, has played an important role in buoying private enterprise.
经合组织国家频繁要求当局解决粮食行业的“反竞争兼并、滥用主导地位、卡特尔和固定价格、纵向约束以及排斥行为”问题。	The OECD concurs, and has frequently called on authorities to address “anti-competitive mergers, abuse of dominance, cartels and price fixing, vertical restraints, and exclusive practices” in the food sector.
通过有目的的建设，我们可以解决股权和人权问题，确保转型的公平性和平稳性，以及能源基础设施具备生态可靠性和民主控制。	If we build it purposefully, we can address issues of equity and human rights, ensuring that the transition is fair and smooth, and that new energy infrastructure is ecologically sound and democratically controlled.
这意味着，如果巴基斯坦能源部门进行合理的改革，巴基斯坦经济原本能够实现显著更快的增长 — — 大约每年4 % — —有可能给年轻人和不断增长的人口制造足够的就业岗位。	This means that, had Pakistan’s energy sector been reformed properly, the country’s economy could have grown significantly faster – by about 4% per year – potentially creating a sufficient number of jobs for a young and growing population.
国会预算办公室估算，若要在2015年弥补过去16年的通胀和燃料效率提高影响并维持当前的融资水平（处于不足状态 ） ， 汽油价格需要调高10美分/加仑。	The CBO estimates that an increase of ten cents a gallon would be required in 2015 simply to offset the last 16 years of inflation and fuel-efficiency gains and to maintain current (inadequate) funding levels.
第三轮冲击波来自欧元，由此引发了长期利率的迅速趋同，而此前某些国家的长期利率要比德国高出7个百分点。	The third shock was the euro, which has induced a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in some countries had been five to seven percentage points above the German level.
然而，和世界上许多因与外界隔绝而陷入赤贫的地区不一样的是，海地虽然就在世界上最大的市场旁边，却仍然极度贫困。	But, whereas many parts of the world are extremely poor because of their isolation, Haiti is extremely poor despite its proximity to the world’s largest market.
ECT的批评者没能证明对他们来说似乎是明显的东西说明，在最小化治疗引起的问题和阻止那些受到治疗伤害的人要求赔偿上存在积极的共谋。	The failure of ECT’s critics to demonstrate what to them seems obvious indicates an active conspiracy to minimize treatment-induced problems and to block those who have been injured by treatment from seeking redress.
在政府、行业、民间团体和多边机构的全力支持下，分散式可再生能源不仅可以照亮非洲大陆；也能够解决它的就业问题。	With dedicated support from governments, industry, civil society, and multilateral agencies, decentralized renewables can do more than illuminate a continent; they can also put it to work.
对报道的评估都必须考虑到这一细节，管理者要为任务遴选最佳记者 — — 并提供需要的支持保证所有记者安全。	Any assessment of a story needs to account for that nuance, with managers choosing the best journalist for the job – and providing the support needed to keep all journalists safe.
政策制定者们应当抛弃繁杂的碳减排谈判，取而代之的则是达成协定，共同投资研究和改进技术，使之达到一个可供有效利用的水平。	Policymakers should abandon fraught carbon-reduction negotiations, and instead make agreements to invest in research and development to get this technology to the level where it needs to be.
事实上，按照当今的衡量标准，查尔斯·戴高乐、温斯顿·丘吉尔和德怀特·艾森豪威尔都属于比较专制的领袖。	Indeed, measured against today’s standards, Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill, and Dwight Eisenhower were comparatively authoritarian leaders.
政治和经济上的谁战争已经在不少地区打响，国际河流上的水坝建设以及用强制外交或其他手段防止这类工程的尝试就是明��。	Political and economic water wars are already being waged in several regions, reflected in dam construction on international rivers and coercive diplomacy or other means to prevent such works.
答案几乎肯定是可以，除非他本人直接陷入“ parapolítica ”困境，或者美国明确否决自由贸易协定，并推迟为哥伦比亚计划提供后续的资金，或者为继续注资提出附加条件。	The answer is almost certainly yes, unless the parapolítica mess reaches him directly, or the US explicitly rejects the FTA and postpones or attaches conditions to renewal of funding for Plan Colombia.
利坦和西格弗莱德的书中所描述的创新表明了经济学界产生了大量非常有价值的工作，特点是化大力气提供真正的证据。	The innovations described in Litan’s and Siegfried’s books show that the economics profession has produced an enormous amount of extremely valuable work, characterized by a serious effort to provide genuine evidence.
首尔 — — 在过去半个世纪里，韩国已成为发展中国家的典范，举世瞩目的经济增长令其登上全球第八大贸易国的宝座并实现 人均收入26,000美元。	SEOUL – In the last half-century, South Korea has become a model for developing countries, with remarkable economic growth enabling it to become the world’s eighth largest trading country and achieve per capita income of $26,000.
另一方面，人性又被无望和沮丧感重重包围，这些感觉来自我们似乎无法克服的挑战，比如污染、气候变化和无穷无尽的种族主义和恐怖主义。	On the other hand, much of humanity is besieged by feelings of helplessness and frustration, owing to the challenges we seem unable to resolve, from pollution and climate change to unrelenting radicalism and terrorism.
但是，除非人们明确地将目标指向世界农村贫困人口的困境，否则解决全球移民和难民数量激增问题的措施就不可能成功。	But no effort to address the issues surrounding the global surge in migrants and refugees will succeed unless it specifically targets the plight of the world’s rural poor.
多数民众较之冷静的利益考量似乎更容易受情绪支配 — — 这在特定条件下会导致大规模屠杀或温暖的同情。	Most people appear to be more easily swayed by emotions – which can lead them to mass murder or warm compassion, depending on the circumstances – than by the cool calculus of rational self-interest.
卸任的胡锦涛主席指出，中国总体GDP和人均收入应该在2020年翻一番，这意味着年均7.5%的增长率。	Outgoing President Hu Jintao indicated that China’s total GDP and per capita income should double by 2020, which will require 7.5% average annual growth.
除了不断带来焦虑，特朗普的奇异任期还提出了一个更加根本性的问题：已经在世界各国众多前哨阵地遭到围困的自由民主，如今是否也有可能失去自己的大本营？	Beyond producing constant anxiety, Trump’s bizarre presidency poses a more fundamental question: Having already come under siege in many of its outposts around the world, is liberal democracy now at risk of losing its citadel, too?
如今，对日本国会上下议院控制权分裂的情况已不复存在，安倍的自民党牢牢控制着两院，因此现代化日本国家安全治理的法案肯定将获得通过。	Now that split control of the Diet’s upper and lower houses has been resolved, with Abe’s Liberal Democrats in strong control of both chambers, a bill to modernize Japan’s national-security governance is certain to pass.
毕竟，尽管财务绩效低劣，但许多中国国有企业拥有很多资产，包括最先进的设备、一流的技术团队、有竞争力的产品等。	After all, despite their grim financial performance, many of China’s SOEs have a lot going for them, including state-of-the-art equipment, first-rate technical staff, and competitive products.
德国政府可以利用手中巨大的杠杆去迫使法意两国实施双方所需的结构性改革，同时允许实施一个促进增长的需求刺激计划去驱除高悬在欧元区之上的通缩威胁。	The German government can use its considerable leverage to compel France and Italy to pursue the structural reforms that both countries need, while allowing a growth-friendly demand stimulus to lift the threat of deflation hanging over the eurozone.
无论是在撒哈拉以南的非洲还是中东地区，那里的民众和政府出于政治、历史或文化方面的原因，都更倾向于请求欧洲而不是北约来协助解决问题。	Whether in sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East, their populations and governments are more inclined – for political, historical, or cultural reasons – to request European rather than NATO assistance.
中毒的首批症状之一是呕吐，并且消化道中70%的剩余尼古丁在到达其他器官之前已在肝脏中被新陈代谢，因此吸收那么多尼古丁并不是件容易事。	Given that one of the first symptoms of intoxication is vomiting, and that 70% of the remaining nicotine in the digestive tract is metabolized by the liver before it reaches other organs, absorbing that much nicotine is not easy.
取决于人们能否在国际社会的帮助下，按照国际法的规定进行认真的面对面谈判。 这才是解决问题的唯一出路。	Serious face-to-face talks, in accordance to international law and with the help of the international community, are the only way forward.
对领导能力的学习有许多种途径，从经验中学习是其中最常见、也是最有力的方式，它带给人们在危机中至关重要的习惯知识。	Learning leadership occurs in a variety of ways. Learning from experience is the most common and most powerful.
与会的200人中只有一位给出了否定答案 — — 在欧洲目前的经济形势下，这一对趋势性风险的集体评估结论委实让人感到意外。	Only one person out of 200 thought that it would not – a rather surprising collective assessment of the trending risks, given Europe’s current economic situation.
其次，美国实力和影响力相对中国和其他崛起大国的衰落是自然的、不可避免的，而不是长期依赖美国保护和支持的国家的警报。	Second, the decline in US power and influence relative to China and other rising powers is natural, inevitable, and not a cause for alarm among those long reliant on America’s protection and support.
无论从物种短期生态健康，还是长期遗传健康的角度来看，鳕鱼和其它鱼类个体中大鱼、成鱼的消失实在令人不安。	The absence of big, old individual cod and other fish is worrisome from the standpoint of the short-term ecological health of the stock, as well its longer-term genetic health.
事实上，没有一位美国企业界“大佬”提到美国政府削减科学拨款。 科学拨款对于加强美国经济的比较优势、支持美国人民生活水平的提高至关重要。	Indeed, none of America’s corporate titans mentioned the administration’s reductions in funding for science, so important for strengthening the US economy’s comparative advantage and supporting gains in Americans’ standard of living.
在介绍一位印度数学家进入哈佛大学时，Ludwig Wittgenstein这样写道 ： “ 科学方面的天才通常在其一生中能有一个伟大的观点；他有两个 。 ”	When recommending an Indian mathematician to a Harvard colleague, Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote that: “scientific geniuses generally have one great idea in their life; he has had two.”
其唯一的效果将是欧元区政治领导人可以宣称财政联盟已经建成，欧洲距离迈向终极目标 — — 政治联盟又近了一步。	Its only effect will be to allow the eurozone’s political leaders to claim that they have created a fiscal union, and thus that they have moved Europe closer to the political union that is their ultimate goal.
在许多国家，不利的社会规范还写入法律，限制妇女的职业选择和获得护照、外出旅行、开办企业、拥有或继承产权的能力。	In many countries, adverse social norms are also codified in laws that limit women’s professional choices and their ability to obtain passports, travel outside their homes, start businesses, and own or inherit property.
政策中心的这一转移已有实际体现。 例如，奥巴马总统下令派遣2500名海军陆战队员到澳大利亚北部的某基地进行训练。	President Barack Obama’s decision to rotate 2,500 US Marines through a base in northern Australia is an early sign of that pivot.
在未来几年中，俄国将提供给欧洲很大的机会进行更为紧密的合作，但是，它也会在干涉欧洲事务上构成更多的风险。	In the next few years, Russia will offer Europe a great opportunity for closer cooperation, but it will also pose a risk of increased intrusion in European affairs.
要降低面对高波动资本流的脆弱性，它们应该推进汇率弹性，确保足够的国际储备，并实施谨慎制定的资本管制。	To reduce their vulnerability to volatile capital flows, they should promote exchange-rate flexibility, secure adequate international reserves, and adopt carefully designed capital controls.
哪怕民主党人仅仅夺回众议院，特朗普的日子也会变得极为复杂，因为新一届多数派肯定会发起大规模调查，甚至可能会启动弹劾。	Even if the Democrats take only the House, life for Trump will become far more complicated, owing to the raft of investigations that the new majority would be certain to launch, and possible impeachment proceedings.
考虑到美国公司已就它们所赚取的强势美元的影响发出了警告 — — 更不用说入境游减少和贸易平衡恶化了 — — 这一条件远非板上钉钉。	Given warnings from US companies about the impact of a stronger dollar on their earnings – not to mention signs of declining inward tourism and a deteriorating trade balance – this is not guaranteed.
但是当儿子继承了他的父亲建筑原理的核心思想，并且把它用来服务一个寻求用某些曾驱使希特勒的理由来利用奥运会的政权时，你能说他没有有意地表现那些罪过吗？	But, in this case, when the son borrows essential elements of his father’s architectural principles and serves a regime that seeks to use the Games for some of the same reasons that animated Hitler, is he not willingly reflecting those sins?
在高峰时期，那些黄金狂人 — — 某些偏执投资者以及其他对政治议程充满恐惧者的集合 — — 都兴致勃勃地预测黄金将在未来几年中不断上涨至2000美元，3000美元，甚至到达5000美元每盎司。	At the peak, gold bugs – a combination of paranoid investors and others with a fear-based political agenda – were happily predicting gold prices going to $2,000, $3,000, and even to $5,000 in a matter of years.
毕竟，就在去年，最大的两家化石燃料公司 — — 雪佛龙和埃克森美孚 — — 合计赚取了超过500亿美元的利润。	After all, just last year, the top two fossil-fuel companies – Chevron and ExxonMobil – together pulled in more than $50 billion in profits.
据最全面的数字媒体消费调查2018年数字新闻报告显示，在消费者信心趋于稳定的同时，订阅量正在呈现出上升的势头。	According to the Digital News Report 2018 – the most comprehensive survey of digital media consumption – subscriptions are trending up while consumer confidence has stabilized.
当这一谬误以事实的面貌出现时，媒体强调我国政府如史蒂芬斯所言“滥用欧洲伙伴的信任和好意”也就不足为奇了。	Once this fallacy is presented as fact, it is only natural that coverage highlights how our government is, in Stephens’s words, “squandering the trust and goodwill of its eurozone partners.”
十天后，示威者占领了涉嫌策划袭击的伊斯兰民兵组织安萨尔伊斯兰教义组织的基地，而这仅仅是袭击全市民兵驻地行动的一部分而已。	Ten days later, protesters overran the base of Ansar al-Sharia, the Islamist militia suspected of masterminding the attack, as part of a sweep of raids on militia compounds throughout the city.
这意味着京都议定书模式走到了终点，该议定书和多哈模式一样建立在远大而又具体的目标基础之上，当时曾迫使相关各方就具体议题进行谈判。	This implies the end of the Kyoto Protocol model, which, like the Doha model, is based on a detailed agenda, established according to specific and ambitious targets, with all relevant actors then compelled to negotiate each topic.
但许多国家 — — 如澳大利亚、加拿大和新加坡 — — 却在从未签署确保其他国家人员自由流动协议的情况下通过发放与技术相匹配的签证而做得很好。	But plenty of countries – such as Australia, Canada, and Singapore – do just fine without agreements guaranteeing freedom of movement from other countries, by issuing skills-matching visas.
这也解释了下面一些行为：几个欧盟成员国重新接收了那些关押在关塔那摩监狱的本国公民和居留者；法国最近接收一个曾经入狱的阿尔及利亚籍囚犯；而另外几个欧盟成员国正考虑接收那些被排除了恐怖嫌疑，却因为某些不可抗因素而难以回到其所属国的囚犯。	That is why EU member states have already received their own nationals and former residents from Guantánamo. That is why France recently received an Algerian ex-detainee.
“零冲突”政策乍一看是一种温稳健的政策，但其基础观点是土耳其乃中东霸权，是冲突的裁决者，说到底，其他较次要的中东国家都得照土耳其的指令行事。	While initially viewed as pacific and moderate, it was underpinned by an overarching view of Turkey as the hegemonic regional power – as an arbiter of conflicts, but ultimately also as an enforcer of its own views on lesser players.
第二个解释便是为了解决这个问题：尽管我们需要果断行动，但经济条件的复杂性以及在什么才是正确的政策应对这一问题上的分歧意味着出现重大失误的风险很高。	A second explanation addresses that question: While bold action is required, the complexity of economic conditions, and disagreement about the right policy responses, implies a risk of serious error.
笔者（连同里卡多·豪斯曼，安德烈斯·瓦拉斯科以及其他研究者）针对增长状况诊断方式的研究就是这类工作的例子，展现出如何在一个特定背景下从多个增长制约性因素中筛选出其中较为相关的。	My research on growth diagnostics (with Ricardo Hausmann, Andrés Velasco, and others) is an example of this style of work, showing how one can identify in a specific context the more binding among a multitude of growth constraints.
只有在更僵化的工业经济体 — — 那里的工资总是缺乏灵活性 — — 决策者才会把汇率运动用作克服工资刚性的手段。	It is only in more sluggish industrial economies, where wages are assumed to be inflexible, that policymakers advocate exchange-rate movements as a means to overcome wage stickiness.
比如说，西方这些年来对改革和民主的强调简直就是某种威胁，常用的典型口吻如下 ： “ 帮我们搞定伊拉克，否则我们就在你家里推广民主人权 ！ ”	For example, the Western emphasis on reform and democracy in recent years has been used more often than not as a threat, a typical message being: “Help us in Iraq or we will press for democracy and human rights in your own country.”
目前，这一宣传丝毫没有减弱迹象，而只要普京的围困叙事战略继续产生政治红利，这一状况也不太可能发生改变。	So far, there has been no diminuendo, and there is unlikely to be one so long as Putin’s siege narrative strategy continues to yield political dividends.
直到今年春天，大多数的观察家都还认为，美元在国际储备中所占的比重将逐渐下滑，欧元的比重将上升，而全世界将平缓地过渡到一种多元储备的格局。	Until this spring, most observers had assumed that the share of the dollar in international reserves would gradually fall, while that of the euro would rise, and that the world would gradually and smoothly make a transition to a multi-reserve regime.
如此类推，这种限制只能服务于那些“人民公敌 ” — —少数群体和外国人（对于右翼民粹主义者来说）或金融精英（就左翼民粹主义者而言 ） 。	Such constraints can only serve the “enemies of the people” – minorities and foreigners (for right-wing populists) or financial elites (in the case of left-wing populists).
但语言也并非毫无作用，的确很少有人质疑在安南任职期间，人权问题在国际权衡中所占的分量超过了以往任何时候。	But words are not without consequences, and there is little question that human rights has occupied a higher place in international deliberations during Annan’s tenure than ever before.
上一位美国总统同情少数群体和移民；捍卫人权和公民权；取得了与伊朗的外交突破；寻求巴勒斯坦和平；问题最大的则是试图按住以色列领导人。	The last US president showed empathy for minorities and immigrants; defended human and civil rights; achieved a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran; sought peace in Palestine; and, most problematic, attempted to hold the Israeli leader to account.
在有关将于11月份最终签订的改革欧盟机构的条约的问题上，最近的事态表明遗忘症确实扮演了一个中心的角色。	When it comes to the treaty to reform the Union’s institutions, which will be finalized in November, recent events suggest that amnesia does play a central role.
中国占世界经济的15 % ， 因此，即使它占美国6,000亿美元赤字的比例与此相同，也有900亿美元 — — 远高于200亿美元的门槛。	China accounts for 15% of the world economy, so even its proportionate share of the US’s $600 billion deficit would be $90 billion – well over the $20 billion threshold.
官员必须抛弃短视和政治正确性， 改善美国老化的基础设施，改革其教育和移民制���，追求长期财政整合。	Officials will have to put aside short-term motives and party orthodoxy to bolster America’s aging infrastructure, reform its education and immigration systems, and pursue long-term fiscal consolidation.
事实上，癌细胞和入侵性物种之间的相似之处表明成功治疗癌症的原则或许并不在于微生物学领域的神奇弹药，而在于应用生态学领域对进化动力学的研究。	Indeed, the parallels between cancerous cells and invasive species suggest that the principles for successful cancer therapy might be found not in the magic bullets of microbiology but in the evolutionary dynamics of applied ecology.
Acorns是一个自动配置日常买入的一定比例给预先选定的投资组合的应用。 这类创业企业正在快速向竞争激烈的市场挺进。	Startups such as Acorns – an app that automatically allocates a proportion of everyday purchases to a pre-selected investment portfolio – are making rapid inroads into a very competitive marketplace.
中央政府面临非常有利的财政环境 — — 债务-GDP之比只有20%左右 — — 实施更大规模的债务置换计划正当其时。	With the central government enjoying such favorable fiscal conditions – its debt-to-GDP ratio stands at only about 20% – now is the ideal time to initiate a much larger debt-swap program.
对于经济危机来说，数十亿美元、欧元、日元或者人民币的的政府救援和财政刺激计划已经被计划或执行以阻止全球经济的进一步下滑。	As for the economic crisis, bailouts and stimulus packages on the order of billions of dollars, euros, yen, or yuan have been planned or implemented to stem the further slide of the global economy.
如果政府不出手援助大银行、保险巨头AIG和汽车业，如果美联储不向经济注入巨量流动性，超级富豪的财富可能遭受重创。	If the government had not bailed out large banks, the insurance giant AIG, and the auto industry, and if the Federal Reserve had not flooded the economy with liquidity, the wealth of the super-rich would have taken a severe blow.
我们已经不能再指望美国坚持、更不要说推行现有的规则，我们也不能想当然地认定世界其他国家能够赞同、更不用说坚持奉行一套共同的规则。	The United States can no longer be counted on to uphold, much less enforce, existing rules, and countries more broadly cannot be assumed to agree on, much less adhere to, a common set of norms.
但在去年12月的巴黎，196家政府同意必须将全球变暖幅度限制在前工业化水平以上1.5℃以内 — — 这一目标很有希望带来这样的转变。	But last December in Paris, 196 governments agreed on the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels – an objective that holds the promise of delivering precisely such a transformation.
因此，实现海洋可持续发展目标要求国际社会重申其对巴黎气候协议的承诺，并宣布截止2050年实现零净排放目标的具体步骤。	Achieving SDG 14 therefore demands that the international community reaffirm its commitment to the Paris climate agreement, and to announce concrete steps toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
普京地缘政治的当务之急本可以通过保留碳氢工业管道建设的国家所有权和允许私有企业提炼、加工、出售俄罗斯的石油和天然气来实现。	Putin’s geopolitical preoccupations could be accommodated by sensibly preserving state ownership of pipeline infrastructure in the hydrocarbons sector, while allowing private companies to extract, process, and sell Russia’s oil and gas.
在协议达成后，一个在我的团队和我本人在各界广泛树立耐药性意识期间不时跟踪拍摄的德国电视摄制组曾经在直播中问我，这个项目的结果是否比金砖四国的概念更重要。	After the agreement was reached, a German television crew that had occasionally followed my team and me as we worked to spread awareness of AMR asked me, on air, whether the outcome was more important than the BRIC concept.
葛兰素史克曾表示Mosquirix的供应将“不以盈利为目的 ” ； 但制药公司仍然必须做到收支平衡。	GSK has said that Mosquirix will be offered “not for profit”; but the pharmaceutical company still must break even.
根据这些预测 — — 它们基于模型、新数据以及某些机构或预测者的判断 — — 美国、英国和日本是增长向好的主要动力。	According to these projections – which are based on models, new data, and the judgment of the particular institution or forecaster – the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan are contributing the most to the uptick in growth.
《绅士资本主义之死 》 （ The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism）的作者菲利普·奥格（Philip Augar）认为“金融城的好传统连同坏习惯一起被抛弃了 ， ” 撒切尔的改革“让我们仓促地奔向金融危机 。 ”	Philip Augar, the author of The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism, argues that “Good characteristics of the City were thrown out along with the bad,” and that Thatcher’s reforms “put us on a helter-skelter course towards the financial crisis.”
其中一个更具讽刺意味的结果是许多这样失败者选择吹嘘财富、个人成功和天才的自恋的亿万富翁来担任他们的总统。	One of the more ironic consequences is that many such people in the US have chosen as their president a narcissistic billionaire who brags about his wealth, personal success, and genius.
尤其是埃及政府指责在2013年一次军事政变中被其推翻的兄弟会应当对从伊斯兰国在西奈半岛的叛乱到国家经济困难在内的埃及国内所有的弊病负责。	The Egyptian government, in particular, blames the Brotherhood – which it overthrew in a 2013 military coup – for all of the country’s ills, from an Islamic State insurgency on the Sinai Peninsula to the country’s economic hardships.
相反，这些高管们基本上都是自己收入条款的设定者，这其实反映出在公司治理，税法和金融工程等方面的失灵。	Rather, managers essentially get to set the terms of their own pay, through compensation packages that reflect failures of corporate governance, tax law, and financial engineering.
未来二十年将会是另一种逻辑的全球化，将来的赢家会是那些大国强国，只有它们才能动员庞大的政府资源，扶植自己的嫡系部队，在金融争霸赛中胜出。	The next 20 years will see a different globalization, in which the winners are large, powerful countries that mobilize government resources in the interest of creating winners in the race for financial supremacy.
但那些银行大佬们却依然坚持自己应当被允许运营更高杠杆的全球业务，并基于企业股票回报率来向他们支付报酬 — — 无论出现任何风险。	And leading bank executives still insist that they should be allowed to run highly leveraged global businesses, in which they are paid based on their return on equity – unadjusted for any risk.
这意味着不仅要扩大现有机构的影响 — — 在这方面改革其实是先决条件 — — 而且还包括建立新的机构，如全球竞争管理局。	That means not only increasing the clout of existing institutions – here, reform is a prerequisite – but also establishing new institutions, such as a Global Competition Authority.
1944年9月市场花园计划的失败在小说和电影遥远的桥中都进行过不朽的描述，这次计划的失败导致1944到1945年冬天饥荒在荷兰爆发。	The failure of Operation Market Garden in September 1944, immortalized in the book and film A Bridge Too Far, led to famine in the Netherlands in the winter of 1944-1945.
微软公司说，如果MNS空间不阻挡其中文博客，那么，中国的防火墙长城就会阻挡中国互联网使用者接触使用它的服务。	If MSN Spaces did not censor its Chinese blogs, Microsoft argues, the Great Chinese Firewall would simply be programmed to block Chinese Internet users from accessing its service.
四处蔓延的腐败激起了深刻的不满： 工人们抗议安然式诈骗毁掉了自己一生的积蓄，城市居民反对非法侵占土地，而农村人则不得不日日与大大小小的不公平现象抗争。	Widespread corruption has bred deep discontent: workers protest the Enron-like bilking of their life savings, townspeople fight against illegal land seizures, and villagers battle injustices – small and large – on a daily basis.
美国总统里根、中国领导人邓小平、英国首相撒切尔夫人、法国总统密特朗以及苏联总统戈尔巴乔夫主宰着世界新闻头条。	US President Ronald Reagan, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President François Mitterrand, and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev dominated the world’s headlines.
经济 — — 以双底W形的衰退 — — 在第二季度有所反弹，这一反弹由消化1000亿退税的临时效应所推进。	The economy rebounded – in a double-dip, W-shaped recession – in the second quarter, boosted by the temporary effects on consumption of $100 billion in tax rebates.
但是，尽管这对某些人来说是好消息，但它不足以解决收入、财富和机会不平等性加剧的问题 — — 也不足以带来西方经济可以和应该形成的包容性繁荣。	But, while this is good news for some, it is inadequate to arrest the rising inequality of income, wealth, and opportunity – or to unleash the inclusive prosperity that Western economies can and should be generating.
共和党将通过废除房产税最终实现他们由来已久的企图 — — 建立一个富人统治的王朝，这与该党曾经广为宣传的“机会平等”口号完全是南辕北辙。	With the abolition of the estate tax, the Republicans would finally realize their long-held ambition of creating a dynastic plutocracy – a far cry from the “equality of opportunity” maxim the party once trumpeted.
今天，阿塞拜疆的首都巴库就像一个巨大的建筑工地，高层住宅和商铺拔地而起，道路建设的发展也一日千里，这显然使各种各样的阶层都从中受益。	Today, the capital, Baku, resembles a huge construction site, with high-rise housing, stores, and roads being built at a breakneck pace – and apparently benefiting the broad strata of the population.
法拉奇在宣传英国脱欧时常常片面地移用丘吉尔本人的战时修辞，说这是英国反抗暴政、捍卫自由的最佳时刻，而他的目标却是让丘吉尔所支持的工程轰然解体。	Farage’s campaign for Brexit, often pilfering Churchill’s own wartime rhetoric about Britain’s finest hour in defending freedom against tyranny, was aimed at dismantling the very project Churchill favored.
而政府或可每年增加1，100亿美元的收入 — — 用于投资促进经济增长的教育等公共产品 — — 因为数字渠道可以降低税收成本并提升其可靠度。	And governments could take in an additional $110 billion every year – to invest in growth-enhancing public goods like education – because digital channels make tax collection cheaper and more reliable.
如今，不但有190多个国家属于联合国；更有各种公共资金国际机构层出不穷，而自二战以来还从未有一个多边机构关门。	Not only do more than 190 countries now belong to the UN; publicly funded international institutions have proliferated, with not one multilateral institution having been shuttered since WWII.
为塞浦路斯制定的《安南计划》的失败告诉我们仅有良好的意愿是不够的—而发生在塞浦路斯的争端与巴以之间的分歧比起来几乎就是微不足道。	The failure of the Annan Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough – and the disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians.
世界银行的重组是行长金墉（Jim Yong Kim）所领导的更加宏大的计划的一部分，金墉努力使世界银行重新定位为与私人部门齐头并进的促进器，而不是主要援助提供者。	The reorganization of the World Bank is a central part of a larger effort under its president, Jim Yong Kim, to reposition the Bank as a facilitator vis-a-vis the private sector, rather than a primary provider.
但这需要释放更多信贷 — — 而专注于清理现有坏账、强迫银行行为审慎化的央行对这一要求多次不予理会。	But this would require the release of more credit – a condition that the central bank, focused on cleaning up existing bad debts and forcing banks to act more prudently, has repeatedly disregarded.
他们的目的是进一步破坏已处于史上最脆弱状态的埃以关系，并获得了成功：在该事件中，IDF无意中杀死了几名埃及士兵。	Their objective was to damage further the Israeli-Egyptian relationship, which is already more fragile than ever, and they succeeded: the IDF accidentally killed several Egyptian soldiers during the incident.
这一令人瞩目的转机背后的原因很具有说明性，它告诉了我们公共卫生工作者面临着怎样的挑战，克服这些挑战的最佳方法呢又在哪里。	The reasons behind this remarkable turnaround are instructive, illustrating the challenges facing public-health workers and the best ways to overcome them.
中国最大的互联万公司腾讯公司现在正在用同样的战略与阿里巴巴竞争。 不管是腾讯还是阿里巴巴，都给出了相当高的回报率 — — 年化水平通常可达6—7 % — —来吸引尽可能多的投资者。	Tencent, China’s largest Internet company, is now using the same strategy to compete with Alibaba, with both companies offering high rates of return – often 6-7% annually – to attract as many investors as possible.
我们还需要发展能够大规模利用太阳能、风能和地热资源的新技术，甚至可以尝试开发生物燃料，只要不威胁到粮食供给和稀有环境资源就行了。	We will need new technologies to mobilize large-scale solar power, wind power, and geothermal power. We might try to tap bio-fuels, but only in forms that do not compete with food supplies or with precious environmental assets.
纽波特海滩—阿根廷总统马克里政府已经向国际货币基金组织（IMF）请求贷款，希望以此阻止比索崩盘。 比索崩盘推高了阿根廷利率，将导致经济放缓，威胁到改革计划。	NEWPORT BEACH – Argentinian President Mauricio Macri’s government has asked the International Monetary Fund for a loan that it hopes can stem a peso rout that has driven up interest rates, will slow the economy, and threatens the reform program.
首先，必须要让私营企业感觉到自己在监管和执法，获取银行贷款和其他资源以及争取政府合同的机会方面是与国有企业竞争公平竞争的。	For starters, private firms need to know that they are competing with SOEs on a level playing field in terms of regulation and law enforcement, access to bank loans and other resources, and opportunities to secure government contracts.
类似地，全球各国政府正在采取被证明能够降低吸烟率、拯救生命的措施，包括健康警告图示、营销活动限制和要求烟草产品以无品牌包装形式出售的法律等。	Likewise, governments worldwide are adopting measures that are proven to reduce smoking rates and save lives, including graphic health warnings, marketing restrictions, and laws requiring tobacco products to be sold in unbranded packaging.
奥巴马对叙利亚政策的解释或许是这样的 ： “ 叙利亚是一个困难的问题，如果处理不好，将威胁美国在该地区的利益。	Obama’s explanation of a Syrian policy might look something like this: “Syria is a difficult problem that, left unchecked, could threaten US interests in the region.
欧洲不会转向法西斯主义；但忽视欧洲正在走向歧途，或者将近来的发展趋势简单地归因为经济不振和高失业也是十分危险的。	Europe is not about to turn fascist; yet it would be dangerous to ignore that it is going astray, or to attribute recent developments solely to economic hard times and high unemployment.
我给德瓦尔特发了一份《日内瓦公约》相关条款的文本，并询问他美国军方是如何根据公约来处理哈纳什的死亡的。	I sent DeWalt a copy of the relevant section of the Geneva Conventions and asked how the US military’s handling of al-Hanashi’s death conforms to it.
正因如此，委员会努力将所有的团体聚到一起，包括老师、部落首领、宗教领袖、妇女、警察、士兵、法官和商人，共同寻找非暴力解决冲突的有效方法。	The Committees therefore seek to bring together all sections of the community – including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, police, soldiers, judges, and businesspeople – to develop ways of resolving conflicts non-violently.
战争意味着不一定为人了解但却是公认的军队和指挥架构；在任何情况下，战争都必然需要与可识别敌方的军事对抗。	War implies armies and command structures that can be recognized, if not clearly known; in any case, war entails a military confrontation with an identifiable adversary .
也门有两大核心问题悬而未决：其一是政府与北部胡塞部队间持续不断的内战，还有就是镇压南方分离主义运动。	Yemen ’s central problems are two: the ongoing civil war that the government is waging against the Houthi tribe in the country’s north, and the suppression of a secessionist movement in the south.
尽管养殖者迫不及待地想要保护自己的生计，但经济学家已经拆穿了犀牛角国内合法市场能够保护野生种群的神话。	While breeders are eager to defend their trade, economists have debunked the myth that a legal domestic market in rhino horns will conserve wild populations.
正如许多发展中国家现都制定了自身的产业升级和多样化战略，一些发达经济体，包括美国，正在试图振兴其制造业基地。	Not only are many developing countries now devising their own strategies for industrial upgrading and diversification; some developed economies, including the United States, are currently seeking to revive their manufacturing bases.
从中国的角度来看，只要经济能持续增长并避免严重的国内社会或政治动荡，特朗普政府的霍布斯式愿景就更具吸引力。	From China’s perspective, the Trump administration’s Hobbesian vision could prove appealing, provided that its economy continues to grow, and that it avoids serious domestic social or political upheaval.
他们还相信 — — 或至少幻想过 — — 各种形式的社会主义和国家社会主义，民主和民权在他们看来并非首要问题。	They also believed in – or at least toyed with – forms of socialism and étatism, and did not consider democracy or civil rights to be priorities.
毕竟农业必须被放到一个更宏大的生态系统来进行研究，而这就意味着发展更有力手段来保护土地，森林和鱼业资源。	Agriculture, after all, must be viewed in the context of the wider eco-system, which also means developing improved methods for conserving resources such as soil, forests, and fisheries.
但最近在布鲁塞尔峰会上做出的决策依然信心不足，这不仅源自于缺乏信任或者在英国否决票上的小题大做，还包括对本次危机明显缺乏干涉手段的状况。	And yet confidence in the recent decisions taken in Brussels remains low, owing not only to dissipated trust and the fuss about the British veto, but also to the apparent absence of measures to intervene in the current crisis.
法国社会党从来没有经历过天主教的现代化改革，也没有过巴特戈德斯贝格纲领（德国社民党曾在1959把它称为马克思主义的最后遗迹 ） 。	The French Socialist Party never had its “aggiornamento” or “Bad Godesberg” (where the German SPD in 1959 renounced its last vestiges of Marxism).
6月8日，在G8峰会之前，英国将主办“为了增长的营养 ” （ Nutrition for Growth）峰会。	On June 8, just ahead of the G-8 Summit, the United Kingdom will convene a summit on Nutrition for Growth.
欧盟能比其他任何全球势力更准确地把握和践行支撑自由世界秩序的理想和原则，因此应当成为接过自由世界衣钵的继任者。	The European Union – which, more than any other global actor, has internalized and operationalized the ideals and principles that undergird the liberal world order – should be the one to do it.
这其实说明了中国当局必须花费巨大的资源来维持一党专政和控制国内桀骜不驯的少数民族故土（约占中国国土面积的60 % ） 。	This underscores the extent to which authorities have to carry out internal repression to perpetuate one-party rule and maintain control over the restive ethnic-minority homelands that make up more than 60% of China’s landmass.
还是会走上一条雨果·查韦斯式的道路，做一个受欢迎的独裁者，和提高穷人的生活水平相比，更愿意建立起个人崇拜呢？	Or will he follow the path of Hugo Chávez, a popular autocrat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor.
冷战期间有40年美苏最高领导人经常举行高风险、高级别的会议，而在冷战结束大约30年后的今天，峰会又重新开始流行。	Some 30 years after the end of the Cold War, a four-decade era often punctuated by high-stakes, high-level encounters between American presidents and their Soviet counterparts, summits are back in fashion.
为了提高阿拉伯裔以色列人的经济和社会融合，2015年12月以色列政府批准了一个真正的历史性的五年计划。	To advance its interest in Arab Israelis’ economic and social integration, in December 2015 the Israeli government approved a truly historic five-year plan.
亚太地区将在奥巴马的第二个任期日程表中占据更加重要的位置，特别是美国将在2014年完成撤军结束阿富汗战争。	The Asia-Pacific region will loom larger in Obama’s second-term agenda, especially as the ongoing US troop withdrawal ends the Afghanistan war by 2014.
总体来说，这些国际资产和流动资产之间的关键区别就是只有前者能被多个不同国家所接受并经常在彼此之间的交易中使用。	The key difference between these international assets and liquid assets in general, then, is that only the former are accepted in a large number of different countries and regularly used in transactions between them.
当然，补贴和彩票也许会有削弱公民遵守税收法律的道德动力的危险，因为合规变成是以某种形式的补偿为条件的。	Of course, there is a risk that subsidies and lotteries may diminish the moral motivation of citizens to obey tax laws, because compliance becomes conditional on some form of compensation.
像那些政权一样，不管是法西斯政权或是共产主义政权，中国的领导人一直在寻求将公共场所和体育比赛项目转化成他们能胜任并且授权统治这个国家的可见证明。	Like those regimes, whether fascist or communist, China’s leaders have sought to transform public space and sporting events into visible proof of their fitness and mandate to rule.
2007年的某个时点，美国经常账户赤字据报占到国内生产总值的6-7 % （ 之后的全年数据下修到5%左右 ） 。	At one point in 2007, the US current-account deficit was reported to be 6-7% of GDP (it has since been revised down to around 5% for the full year).
尽管美国人倾向于将尼克松违反公民权利归结为“水门事件 ” ， 但是，其中所包含的东西要远远超过入窃民主党总部以及随后的掩盖行为。	Though Americans tend to lump Nixon’s violations of civil liberties together under the heading of “Watergate,” much more was involved than the break-in at Democratic Party headquarters and the subsequent cover-up.
“真理将使你获得自由 ” ， 18世纪欧洲启蒙运动的哲学家们刷新了旧的基督教口号。 他们设想了一个开放的过程，而不是设置障碍。	When the Enlightenment philosophers renovated the old Christian slogan, “The truth shall set you free,” they imagined a process of opening doors, not building barricades.
和一切跨国战略一样 ， “ 一带一路”战略需要明智的外交管理与各种不同国家的关系，仔细进行有效规模扩张规划。	Like any cross-border initiative, the “one belt, one road” initiative will require wise diplomacy to manage relationships with diverse countries and careful planning to scale up effectively.
壳牌的评估预测海平面会上升60到70厘米，并指出全球变暖可能加剧西南极冰盖的融化，导致全球海平面出现“5到6米”的上升。	Shell’s assessment foresaw a 60-70 cm rise in sea level, and noted that warming could also fuel the disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, resulting in a worldwide rise in sea level of “five to six meters.”
民粹主义者不去质问欧盟究竟是让人们变得更富有还是更贫穷，却关注一个更根本和强有力的问题 ： “ 我们是谁？	Instead of asking whether the EU is making people richer or poorer, populists are focused on a more fundamental and powerful question: “Who are we?”
最后还有弹劾这种补救办法，这些日子这种办法在华盛顿引发了越来越公开的讨论，伴随这样的讨论还流行一本书，那就是艾伦·J·里奇曼的弹劾案例。	Finally, there remains the remedy of impeachment, which is being discussed more and more openly in Washington these days, accompanied (in a sign of the times) by a book, The Case for Impeachment, by Allan J. Lichtman.
这些投入不但包括可从国外运输的原材料和机器，也包括许多专业化劳动技能、基础设施和规则，它们无法轻易转移，因此存在空间配置。	This includes not only raw materials and machines, which can be shipped around, but also many specialized labor skills, infrastructure, and rules, which cannot be moved easily and hence need to be spatially collocated.
比如，欧元区崩溃、美国再次爆发政府关门和债务上限争论、中国出现硬着陆、以色列和伊朗因核扩散问题开战等威胁将比2013年小得多。	The threat, for example, of a eurozone implosion, another government shutdown or debt-ceiling fight in the United States, a hard landing in China, or a war between Israel and Iran over nuclear proliferation, will be far more subdued.
结果他们似乎往往倡导一脚在内、一脚在外的对欧关系 — — 宣扬英国对欧的半脱离状态，而不是全心全意地参与其中。	As a result, they often seem to be advocating for a half-in, half-out relationship with Europe – for a Britain that is semi-detached, rather than fully engaged.
为了取得进展，各国必须学会在捍卫自身原则的同时尊重他国利益 — — 并且永远不要忽视共同利益和目标。	In order to make progress, countries must learn to defend their principles while respecting those of others – and never to lose sight of their shared interests and objectives.
事实上，由于商品价格偏低，世界可能将于2009年目睹俄罗斯和巴西的准衰退，中国和印度则会大大放慢速度，这对于这些国家来说就等同于硬着陆（增长大大低于潜能 ） 。	Indeed, the world should expect a near recession in Russia and Brazil in 2009, owing to low commodity prices, and a sharp slowdown in China and India that will be the equivalent of a hard landing (growth well below potential) for these countries.
让市场决定资源配置，并同时确保所有参与者能公平竞争，需要政府设定明确的竞争规则，这或许需要一个强有力的“竞争委员会”来提供支持。	Enabling the market to drive resource allocation, while ensuring a level playing field for all participants, will require the establishment of clear competition principles, possibly supported by a powerful “competition commission.”
世界货币基金组织的世界储蓄率自从二十世纪七十年代初期以来一直呈一个持续的下滑趋势，尽管它在2002年有了一定的上扬，但还是远远低于过去三十年的最高水平。	The IMF’s world saving rate has maintained a fairly consistent downward trend since the early 1970’s, and, while it has picked up since 2002, it is still well below the peak levels attained in the previous three decades.
20世纪90年代，刺激骨髓生成抗感染白细胞的细胞激素开始用于癌症治疗，进一步降低了危及生命的感染并发症的护理危险性。	Starting in the 1990’s, cytokines, drugs that stimulate bone marrow to produce infection-fighting white blood cells, began to be integrated into cancer treatments, further mitigating the risk of life-threatening infectious complications of care.
与在中东一样，美国与亚洲国家的双边军事关系的对象通常是“亦敌亦友 ” ， 这些国家一方面都与美国建立了盟友关系，另一方面彼此极不信任。	As in the Middle East, America’s bilateral military relationships in Asia are often with “frenemies,” countries that share an alliance with the US while deeply mistrusting one another.
从那一天起，美国不再是领导世界的超级大国 — — 那个有缺陷但最终心怀善意的和平，繁荣以及世界各地人权的保障者。	On that day, the United States ceased to be the world’s leading superpower – the flawed but ultimately well-meaning guarantor of peace, prosperity, and human rights around the world.
巴黎—欧洲的2015年始于极左翼的左翼联盟党（Syriza）赢得希腊选举，终于另外三场证明了政治极化日益兴盛的选举。	PARIS – In Europe, 2015 began with the far-left Syriza party’s election victory in Greece. It ended with another three elections that attested to increasing political polarization.
从1996年到2007年，拉美和加勒比地区只有四个国家 — — 巴西、智利、多米尼加和巴拿马 — — 增长快于美国。	From 1960 to 2007, only four countries in Latin America and the Caribbean – Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic, and Panama – grew faster than the US.
波斯尼亚塞族人 — — 以及他们在塞尔维亚的支持者 — — 似乎马上就要赢得战争，而联合国也没有采取行动拘留那些受控下令或执行暴行的人。	The Bosnian Serbs – and their supporters in Serbia – seemed to be winning the war, while the UN made no provision for taking into custody those charged with ordering or carrying out atrocities.
在预见到这一点的情况下，存款者对公投声明的反应就是立刻提取欧元现金或将它们汇到法兰克福，巴黎，纽约或其他地方。	Foreseeing this, depositors would have responded to the announcement of a referendum by immediately withdrawing their euros in cash or by wiring them to Frankfurt, Paris, New York, or elsewhere.
这是个遗憾，因为Lugovoi在俄罗斯的地位能够告诉我们关于我的国家在弗拉季米尔•普京总统统治下的第七个年头的许多情况。	This is a pity, because Lugovoi’s status in Russia tells us much about my country in the seventh year of President Vladmir Putin’s rule.
直到不久前，发达国家市场还主宰着风险溢价发现及定价机制，这归功于他们运行良好及成熟的产权基础设施 — — 包括明确的规则和高度透明的市场价格形成机制。	Until recently, advanced-country markets predominated in setting risk premia, owing to their mature and well-functioning PRIs, which include clear rules and a high level of transparency in price formation.
关于推进多元文化的一场举国讨论正在进行中，并且使公众对建国五项原则又重燃兴趣，这一民族哲学思想在苏哈托统治时期被受到质疑，而现在它被一些人看作是印尼历史上多元文化的一种象征。	A national dialogue about fostering pluralism is now in progress, and has inspired renewed public interest in Pancasila, the national philosophy discredited during the Suharto years but now seen by some as a symbol of Indonesia’s historic pluralism.
如果我们把这一预测外推 — — 没有迹象表明美国会回到2008年之前的增长路径上去 — — 股票收益实际年折现率按6%计算，那么未来成本将是人均150,000美元。	If we project that forward – with nothing visible to restore the US to its pre-2008 growth path – at the annual real discount rate of 6% that we apply to equity earnings, the future costs are $150,000 per capita.
当然，在此期间发生了严重的不当行为，包括贿赂和制度性腐败；但这些罪名根本不足以支撑去年的军事政变及随后的镇压。	Serious wrongdoing, involving bribery and institutional corruption, no doubt occurred along the way; but the scale of such offenses could hardly justify last year's military coup and the subsequent repression.
此次地震的废墟量相当于岩手县11年的垃圾总量，或宫城县19年的垃圾总量 — — 数量之巨远远超过了这些地区的处理能力。	Rubble is equivalent to 11 years of waste in Iwate prefecture, and 19 years of waste in Miyagi prefecture – enormous volumes that exceed these regions’ disposal capacity.
但是减少农业补贴会造成食品价格的上升，至少在一开始会这样，而单单降低农业关税在没有配套政策的支持下并不一定能使发展中国家的食品产量出现上升。	However, cutting farm subsidies will increase food prices, at least initially, while reducing agricultural tariffs alone will not necessarily lead to an increase in food production in poor countries without complementary support.
这种会计体系颇为复杂，管理成本高昂，并可能造成双重征税—因为各成员国通常不允许对发生在国外的亏损和税收义务进行完全销账。	The system is complex, expensive to administer, and can result in double taxation because members usually do not allow full write-offs for losses and tax liabilities incurred abroad.
对乌克兰电力系统的攻击发生在2015年12月，就在专家组报告提交之后不久，在2016年，俄罗斯也并未将美国选举进程视为受保护的民用基础设施。	The attack on the Ukrainian power system occurred in December 2015, shortly after the submission of the GGE report, and in 2016, Russia did not treat the US election process as protected civilian infrastructure.
国际安全取决于我们能够捍卫JCPOA这样的成功外交故事，它们是避免蔓延、一劳永逸地解决对抗和极化的恶性循环的关键。	International security depends on preserving diplomatic success stories such as the JCPOA, which are crucial to avoid contagion and to put an end, once and for all, to dangerous spirals of antagonism and polarization.
对杠杆效应运用的增加，部分要归咎于政府的政策，此政策旨在扩大低收入人群的住房拥有率，但却已证明了这是他们所负担不起的生活方式。	The increase in leverage was driven in part by government policies aimed at expanding home ownership among lower-income groups that have proven unable to afford that life style.
事实上，认识到个人数据是个人资产的企业将更有利地建立与个体消费者的关系，从而更深度地了解消费者的具体需要和渴望。	Indeed, firms that acknowledge that personal data are personal property will be in a better position to build relationships with individual consumers, thereby gaining deeper insights into their specific needs and desires.
事实上，即使从软实力角度，伦敦波特兰咨询公司（Portland Consultancy）的最新研究也将印度排在全球30强之外。	Indeed, even in terms of soft power, a recent study by the Portland Consultancy in London placed India outside the top 30 countries.
但最重要的问题依然存在，就是亚投行对现有的多边金融机构，比如世界银行，究竟是潜在的竞争对手还是喜闻乐见的补充。	But important questions remain – most important, whether the AIIB is a potential rival or a welcome complement to existing multilateral financial institutions like the World Bank.
安哥拉和尼日利亚需要大幅降低对石油的依赖；南非仍然需要实施重大改革措施以解决自种族隔离时代以来困扰它的结构性问题。	Angola and Nigeria need to become far less reliant on oil; and South Africa still needs to implement far-reaching reforms to address structural problems that have plagued it since the apartheid era.
内塔尼亚胡从不采取攻势，他不认为中东乱局是前瞻性战略的触发器，借助形成巴勒斯坦问题的解决方案为该地区带来更广泛的积极变化。	Netanyahu, always on the defensive, does not view Middle East turmoil as a trigger for a proactive strategy that would use a solution to the Palestinian problem as leverage for broader positive change in the region.
但是，欧洲人大体上认为他们的社会产生了最好的生活方式，即使他们的经济在达尔文物竞天择的含义上不比美国的有效率。	Nevertheless, Europeans generally agree that their societies produce the best lifestyles, even if their economies are less efficient than America’s in a Darwinian sense.
在很多西方人看来，很明显是埃及军方推翻了民选政府，而且仍在镇压合法政党，屠杀该党的支持者并监禁其领袖。	To many in the West, it is clear that the Egyptian military has removed a democratically elected government and is now repressing a legitimate political party, killing its supporters and imprisoning its leaders.
类似地，云计算让小企业获得了此前只有大企业才能拥有的IT能力，也使得后勤服务变得越来越精细，而且成本相当低廉。	Likewise, cloud computing gives small enterprises IT capabilities that were previously available only to larger firms – as well as a growing assortment of back-office services – on the cheap.
第一个鼓舞人心的进展发生在坦桑尼亚和莫桑比克，此前曾被比利时非政府组织APOPO训练用于检测地雷的非洲巨鼠现在被赋予防治结核病的全新任务。	The first took place in Tanzania and Mozambique, where African giant pouched rats, which had previously been trained by the Belgian NGO APOPO to detect landmines, were repurposed to help in the fight against tuberculosis (TB).
他们来的时候，用交错的树枝和五颜六色的幡子做成的棕色圆顶帐篷就会在城镇外围出现，活像成群结队的斑纹甲虫。	When they arrived, brown domes made of crisscrossed branches and layers of multicolored mats would appear like crowds of dappled beetles on the outskirts of town.
今年“安倍经济学”的最重要组成部分就是日本央行在零利率的情况下进一步放松货币条件，从而终结通货紧缩的威胁。	The most important component of “Abenomics” this year has been the BOJ’s efforts to ease monetary conditions further, despite zero interest rates, and thus end the threat of deflation.
2013年的一项世界银行研究估算，因空气污染造成的福利损失和劳动收入损失至少相当于印度GDP的8.5 % 。	A 2013 World Bank study estimated that welfare costs and lost labor income due to air pollution amounted to nearly 8.5% of India’s GDP.
日本的援助 — — 与人质赎金无异 — — 必须在4月15日前落实，以赶上金正日诞辰纪念 — — 显然，这才是朝鲜的真正目的，而且极为迫切。	The Japanese aid, like the ransom paid to a kidnapper, must be provided by April 15, just in time for the commemoration of Kim Il-song’s birth – a clear indication of North Korea’s true intentions, and desperation.
怀特提出的机制基于战后美国的贸易盈余，美国用这一盈余让欧洲和日本美元化，作为交换，欧洲和日本默认美国货币政策的完全自由裁量权。 毫不奇怪，这一机制取得了胜利。	Unsurprisingly, White’s scheme, founded on the United States’ post-war trade surplus, which it deployed to dollarize Europe and Japan in exchange for their acquiescence to full monetary-policy discretion for the US, prevailed.
看在我们所有人的份上，我期待着未来中国经济的快车不会脱离其轨道，尽管如果经济的腾飞不会变成步履蹒跚但顽固不变的中国政治体制的一大挑战，将会是一个奇迹。	For all our sakes, I hope that the future does not derail China’s economic progress, though it will be a surprise if it does not challenge its arthritic and adamantine political system.
投资者寻找偶尔被大损失打断的稳定的小收益，一个例子是息差交易，比如投资者在德国和法国借入欧元，然后在希腊和葡萄牙贷出。	Investors search for regular small gains punctuated by occasional large losses, an approach exemplified by the carry trade by which investors borrowed euros in Germany and France to lend in Greece and Portugal.
她在巨大的广告牌下穿过，上面的女郎因性欲亢奋而显得欲仙欲死，穿着内衣裤跳舞，或干脆几乎全裸着慵懒地张开四肢。	She passes under immense billboards on which other women swoon in sexual ecstasy, cavort in lingerie or simply stretch out languorously, almost fully naked.
哈萨克斯坦的巴尔喀什湖现在面临的大规模收缩的风险，对于乌兹别克斯坦边境线上的咸海也是一样 — — 在不到四十年的时间里咸海已经近乎枯竭了。	Kazakhstan’s Lake Balkhash is now at risk of shrinking substantially, much like the Aral Sea – located on the border with Uzbekistan – which has virtually dried up in less than 40 years.
更低的边际税率诱导个人工作更长时间，让他们的潜在所得更多地以应税现金的形式而不是补贴福利和其他非应税报酬的形式获得。	The lower marginal tax rates induced individuals to work more and to receive more of their potential income in taxable cash rather than in fringe benefits and other forms of compensation that are not subject to tax.
然而熟悉人民党的人都知道，它对泰姬陵的袭击只不过是该党仇恨政治方针的体现：这些人反对与穆斯林统治印度历史有关的一切事物。	And yet anyone familiar with the BJP knows that its attacks on the Taj are just one manifestation of the party’s politics of hatred toward anything connected to the history of Muslim rule in India.
与此同时，税收竞赛将继续破坏市场竞争，也让政府无法获得资金投资于公共品。 而从长期看，公共品是确保企业盈利能力的必要条件。	In the meantime, tax competition will continue to erode market competition, while denuding governments of the money needed to invest in the public goods needed to ensure firms’ profitability over the long term.
但如果世界真正想要实现这些共同目标，就必须建立有效的融资机制，以能够创造正确激励的合理的监管为支撑。	But if the world is serious about achieving these shared goals, an effective mechanism for financing them must be established, supported by well-designed regulations that create the right incentives.
早在 2009 年 8 月的大选之际，北约官员就发现，普通阿富汗民众对政府大规模腐败感到厌恶，这也是塔利班征兵的一个最有效借口。	For at least a year prior to the August 2009 elections, NATO officials recognized that ordinary Afghans' disgust with their government's massive corruption was among the Taliban's most effective recruitment tools.
如今，他的第二故乡的媒体仍然在遭受攻击，他本人的被谋杀案件也迟迟得不到解决，他对乌克兰的信念没有获得回报。	Today, as attacks on the media continue in his adopted homeland, and with his own murder unsolved, the faith he placed in Ukraine is not being repaid.
尽管UNRWA有100多个赞助人，但其总预算中的近四分之一 — — 每年近4亿美元 — — 此前都来自美国。	Though UNRWA has more than 100 donors, almost a quarter of its total budget – nearly $400 million annually – previously came from the US.
换句话讲，现在是时候做出努力，帮助印度这样希望改革的贫困国家。 更为迫切的是，非洲致力于经济发展的国家也急需得到同样的帮助。	In other words, it is time for donors to step up to help reform-minded yet poor countries like India, and, even more urgently, those in Africa that are similarly committed to economic development.
毕竟2008年的危机灾难之前，那些金融和工业巨头们可以吹嘘全球化、科技发展和金融自由化的优点 — — 这本该预示着一个增长持续不断的新时代。	After all, before the meltdown in 2008, the captains of finance and industry could trumpet the virtues of globalization, technology, and financial liberalization, which supposedly heralded a new era of relentless growth.
那些迄今仍然不愿将本国市场控制权让渡给泛欧洲权力机构的欧盟成员国也逐渐意识到，大家需要一个更接近于欧洲证券交易委员会的来确保共同标准的执行。	Member states that hitherto were reluctant to cede control over their markets to a pan-European authority are coming to understand that something closer to a European Securities and Exchange Commission is needed to ensure common standards.
这样做从来没有遭到我的选民的批评，因为瑞典制定的教育政策和社会保障安全网降低了工人对竞争的风险厌恶程���。	This never met any criticism from my voters, because educational policy and the social safety net were designed to lower workers’ risk aversion.
但是我们只有下大力气加大研究力度以创造新的能效技术，我们最终才能做到消耗的能源总量大大减少，并且能源消耗更多地是以不影响环境的方式来进行的。	But only if research is doubled to create new energy-efficient technologies will we eventually consume less energy overall and more energy in an environmentally friendly way.
这是一个关于两个民族的引人入胜的回家的故事，它们有着彼此排斥的主张，争夺着占据全世界数百万人心中神圣地位的圣地和庙宇。	It is an absorbing odyssey of two nations with mutually exclusive claims on sacred lands and religious shrines that are central in the lives of millions of people worldwide.
在索尼影业（Sony Pictures）电影《采访》的例子中，世界面临着更深一步的迭代：生活模仿模仿生活的艺术。	In the case of Sony Pictures’ movie The Interview, the world found itself confronted with a further iteration: life imitating art imitating life.
它还需要为失业工人提供某种财务缓冲的政策和计划；若非如此，机器和股权的所有者将利用技术破坏获取经济蛋糕更大的份额。	It will also require policies and programs that provide some financial cushion to displaced workers; otherwise, the owners of machines and equity will seize on technological disruptions to capture an even larger share of the economic pie.
卡特、里根、老布什、克林顿甚至小布什诸位总统及其支持者创建了当前的体系，税率和起税点不再起到抑制企业的反激励效果。	Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and even George W. Bush and their supporters created the current system, in which tax rates and eligibility thresholds are not punitive disincentives to enterprise.
目前，中国已经与新加坡和其他大城市合作改进城镇设计、水管理和环境可持续性，并采取措施释放共享经济的潜力。	Already, China has worked with Singapore and other major cities to improve urban design, water management, and environmental sustainability, as well as taking steps to tap the potential of the sharing economy.
这意味着年消费额可能会从3，880亿美元增长到14，000亿美元 — — 如此诱人的前景已经吸引跨国消费品生产商和零售商投资尼日利亚。	This implies a potential rise in consumption from $388 billion annually to $1.4 trillion – a prospect that is already attracting investments by multinational consumer-goods producers and retailers.
近几个星期以来，很多欧洲国家都承诺要兑现0.7%的许诺，其中五个国家（丹麦、卢森堡、荷兰、挪威和瑞典）已经付诸实施了。	In recent weeks, many European countries have pledged to honor the 0.7% commitment, and five European countries (Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden) already do so.
因此，宣称制裁意味着高昂成本的报告 — — 因为欧盟对俄出口去年高达1,200亿欧元，并且贡献了成千上万工作岗位 — — 具有相当的误导性。	Thus, reports claiming that sanctions imply a high cost – because EU exports to Russia amounted to €120 billion ($161 billion) last year and represent tens of thousands of jobs – are highly misleading.
他们缺少哲学家以赛亚·伯林所谓的“积极自由 ” ， 即自我实现的禀赋，以及“消极自由 ” ， 即在行动路径中避免障碍的自由。	They lack what the philosopher Isaiah Berlin called “positive liberty” – empowerment for self-actualization – as well as “negative liberty,” or freedom from obstacles in one’s path of action.
尽管如此，希腊事实上仍试图摧毁金色黎明党 — — 议会刚刚投票冻结了该党的国家资金支持 — — 这一事实表明，说到底，大部分民主国家总会在某处划出一条界线。	The fact that Greece nonetheless is effectively trying to destroy Golden Dawn – the parliament just voted to freeze the party’s state funding – suggests that, in the end, most democracies will want to draw the line somewhere.
米歇尔测算��从1948年到2011年，生产率增加了80.4 % ， 而中位真实工资只增长了39 % — —并且在过去四十年中几乎毫无增长。	Mishel calculates that productivity increased 80.4% from 1948 to 2011, while median real wages rose only 39% – almost none of the wage growth occurred during the last four decades.
经验显示当最低工资标准相当于实际工资中位线的55%时就将阻碍创造就业（以及经济增长 ） ， 而根据联邦政府规定，波多黎各的最低工资相当于中位线的77 % 。	A rule of thumb is that a minimum wage that is above 55% of the median wage will impede job creation (and economic growth); Puerto Rico’s minimum wage is 77% of the median, owing to the federal mandate.
特朗普还变得更加具有妥协性，他对《纽约时报》说不想通过任命特别检察官调查他的前对手而“伤害克林顿家 ” 。	Trump has become far more conciliatory as well, telling the New York Times that he did not want to “hurt the Clintons” by appointing a special prosecutor to investigate his former opponent.
现代欧洲政治生活的基本要素 — — 个人权利和责任，以及人民对政府的问责权 — — 在伊斯兰世界特别是阿拉伯中东是不存在的。	The essential elements of modern European political life – individual rights and duties, and the accountability of government to the governed – are lacking, particularly in the Arab Middle East.
数字技能不仅可以让年轻人退出非正规行业，还可以让他们摆脱不理想的正规行业工作，比如雇工人数超过412,000人的南非私人保安业。	Such skills enable young people to move not only out of the informal sector, but also out of undesirable formal jobs, such as in South Africa’s private-security industry, which employs more than 412,000 people.
在让所有儿童都获得免疫力方面，最令人振奋、通常也常常被忽视的发展趋势之一是新兴国家疫苗供应者作用日显。	One of the most exciting – and often overlooked – developments in the global push to give all children access to immunization is the growing role of emerging-country vaccine suppliers.
用政治学家热苏斯·席尔瓦-赫尔佐格·马尔克斯（Jesus Silva-Herzog Márquez）的话说 ， “ AMLO所提供的反腐药方就是AMLO 。 ”	In the words of political scientist Jesus Silva-Herzog Márquez, “the medicine offered by AMLO to combat corruption is AMLO.”
国会预算办公室研究报告进一步表明，十二月奥巴马和共和党反对派达成的减税协议明知故犯地大幅度增加了财政预算赤字。	The CBO study also made clear that December’s tax-cut agreement between Obama and the Republican opposition willfully and deliberately increased the budget deficit sharply.
除了人员外，印尼的偏远卫生设施缺乏足够的配套基础设施：洁净水，卫生用品，可靠的电力以及基础医药和设备。	Beyond personnel, remote health facilities in Indonesia lack adequate supporting infrastructure: clean water, sanitation, reliable electricity, and basic medicine and equipment.
在美国，政治极化、对国会选取的不公正划分以及日渐“制 ” （ check）大于“衡 ” （ balance）的宪法阻挠了改革，也让经济陷于风雨飘摇。	In the US, polarized politics, gerrymandered Congressional districts, and a constitution that seems to check more than it balances, have obstructed reforms and left the country seemingly adrift in choppy waters.
因此，出于伦理和实际理由，社会科学家长期以来一直在研究社会成员的关注点如何以某种方式反映于集体决策中，即使该社会非完全民主的社会。	So, for both ethical and practical reasons, social scientists have long investigated how the concerns of a society’s members can be reflected in one way or another in its collective decisions, even if the society is not fully democratic.
这让美国总统奥巴马得以收回承诺 — — 他曾威胁说，如果巴沙尔政权使用化学武器，美国将进行军事干预；也让巴沙尔得以继续屠杀人民。	While it has allowed US President Barack Obama to back down from his threat of military intervention in response to the regime’s use of chemical weapons, it has also allowed Assad to continue to butcher his people.
伦敦 — — 在伦敦经济学院2008年一次针对全球金融危机的讨论中，英国女王伊丽莎白二世一句“为什么没人能预见这场灾难 ？ ” 的提问难倒了满屋子的金融大鳄。	LONDON – During a 2008 discussion of the global financial crisis at the London School of Economics, Queen Elizabeth II famously floored a room full of financial heavyweights by asking, “Why did no one see it coming?”
这种预测与联合国政府间气候变化工作小组最近通过计算得出的二氧化碳排放合理的安全水平两相比较就显得更加糟糕。	This compares poorly with the most recent estimate of a reasonably safe level of CO2 emissions calculated by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
事实上，尼日利亚的电影业已是世界第三，仅次于美国和印度，对该国的经济影响力位居第二，仅次于石油部门。	Indeed, Nigeria’s film industry is the world’s third largest, after the US and India, and is second only to oil production in terms of its economic significance to the country.
1997年谢里夫再次掌权，但是他与军方的对抗多年来逐渐激化，导致1999年再次爆发政变，也带来了佩尔韦兹·穆沙拉夫将军（Pervez Musharraf）随后八年的军人统治。	In 1997, it was Sharif’s turn again. But his confrontation with the military had intensified over the years, resulting in another coup in 1999, leading to eight years of military rule under General Pervez Musharraf.
尽管与美国产生一定程度的冲突确实有助于普京既团结了群众，又重新激发了俄罗斯精英的民族主义，但俄罗斯不是一个受意识形态驱动的国家。	Although some degree of confrontation with the US does help President Vladimir Putin unite the public while burnishing Russian elites’ nationalist credentials, Russia is not an ideologically motivated state.
恰蒂斯加尔邦的部落选民成群结队地抛弃了印度人民党，因为到处有传言说他们传统的土地要被收去“开发 ” ， 同时拉贾斯坦邦的达利特人遭受了无数的公开侮辱，因此在投票箱前组织了反抗。	Tribal voters in Chhattisgarh abandoned the BJP in droves as reports spread of their traditional lands being acquired for “development,” while Dalits in Rajasthan suffered numerous public indignities and revolted at the ballot box.
虽然基金工作人员有时也会指出某国存在信贷规模不断扩大，经常账户赤字增加或生产力停滞不前的问题，但他们往往会低估了这些事件的影响力。	While staff sometimes pointed to booming credit, gaping current-account deficits, or stagnant productivity, they downplayed the implications.
当今在预测上的一个根本问题就是经济减缓的最终成因其实是在心理学和社会学意义上的，并与不断波动的信心和变化中的“动物精神（animal spirits ） ” 相关联。	A fundamental problem in forecasting nowadays is that the ultimate causes of the slowdown are really psychological and sociological, and relate to fluctuating confidence and changing “animal spirits,” about which George Akerlof and I have written.
"布什政府认为只要一提起""战争""和""恐怖主义""这样的字眼，它就有权要求全国上下对其言听计从。 但最高法院的裁决确认了这样一个根本原则：即便是最严重的危险也不能成为布什政府要求如此特权的理由。"	"But the Supreme Court's rulings affirm the fundamental principle that even grave dangers do not warrant the sort of blanket deference to which the Bush Administration believes it is entitled whenever it utters the words ""war"" and ""terrorism."""
火焰病毒能够接管计算机的外围设备、Skype通话记录、借助电脑摄像头拍照，并通过蓝牙设备向任何邻近设备传输信息。	The Flame virus has the capacity to take over a computer’s peripherals, record Skype conversations, take pictures through a computer’s camera, and transmit information via Bluetooth to any nearby device.
20世纪70年代，当通胀被允许从2%增加到4%时，通胀预期完全失去了锚定效应，物价涨幅远远超过了4 % 。	When inflation was allowed to drift from 2% to 4% in the 1970s, inflation expectations became unanchored altogether, and price growth far exceeded 4%.
在皮尤研究中心最近的一项调查中，70%的美国人表示感到“被新闻所累 ” ， 鉴于充斥着媒体的都是些尖酸刻薄的全国性新闻，这一点并不令人意外。	In a recent Pew Research Center survey, seven in ten Americans reported feeling “exhausted by the news.” This isn’t surprising, given the acrimony dominating national news coverage.
台湾唯一的原住民国会议员曾经对陈水扁和民进党进行了一次逻辑上的驳斥，此人在一次国会会议上专门用自己的方言发表了一通演讲，结果没有一个与会议员听得懂。	Taiwan ’s sole aboriginal parliamentarian once provided the logical rebuttal to Chen and the DPP, delivering a speech to a packed Congress entirely in his native tongue, which nobody else in the chamber could understand.
随着中国不断迈向高收入水平，科斯的遗产将十分关键 — — 即他关于企业、金融机构和政府在塑造市场和推动经济发展方面作用与见解。	His legacy – insights into the role of firms, financial institutions, and the state in shaping the market and driving economic development – will prove crucial as China works to achieve high-income status.
例如在4月份，瑞典南部城市马尔默的市长贾梅召集国家应急机构探讨如何挫败“外国机构”的阴谋，为避免影响即将进行的选举而全力保护“马尔默的形象 ” 。	For example, in April, Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, the mayor of the southern city of Malmö, summoned the MSB to discuss how to protect the “image of Malmö” from “foreign entities” that might try to sully it in order to influence the upcoming vote.
传统新闻组织，特别是地方报纸，正在稳步消亡，缩小了选民的信息渠道，而这对于做出知情的政治决策至关重要。	Traditional news organizations, especially local newspapers, are steadily disappearing, shrinking voters’ access to information that is vital to making informed political decisions.
这种差异既有共性的方面，例如蓝色眼睛和棕色眼睛的差异，也有克罗恩氏症易感人群和非易感人群之间的差异。	There are common differences, like the differences between blue eyes and brown eyes, or even between people likely to have Crohn’s disease and those who are unlikely to have it.
而奥朗德，这个比大多数法国人想象中更加睿智也更充满决心的人，为这种广泛存在于人民心中的渴求提供了一种声音（以及一个面孔 ） — —让如今的当政者，尼古拉·萨科齐，下台走人。	Hollande, by appearing more sound and determined than most French voters thought he was, has given a voice (and a face) to a widespread desire to reject the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy.
不管它过去如何，美国在不久的将来必须决定是否成为一个社会民主政体，以及在多大程度上接受社会民主体制？	Whatever it has been in the past, the US in the future will have to choose whether, and how much, it will be a social democracy.
除了批评从个例推出普遍结论的做法外，罗默还将矛头指向了认为经济模型只允许一种互动模式和一种个体决策模式的人。	In addition to criticizing those that draw general conclusions from specific cases, Romer takes aim at those who claim that economic models permit only one mode of interaction and only one mode of individual decision-making.
事实上，尽管CRC堪称签署者最多的人权条约，并且要求政府每五年报告一次遵守情况，但相关工作缺少足够的资源和执法力度。	Indeed, though no human-rights treaty has been more widely ratified than the CRC, which requires governments to report on their compliance once every five years, its work lacks adequate resources and enforcement.
在富有国家受到这种动荡威胁而贫困国家被弃之不顾的情况下，重建世界金融体系应该被摆上国际议程的首要位置。	With rich countries threatened by instability and poor countries largely left to their own devices, the reconstruction of the world financial system should be at the top of the international agenda.
请考虑：5月平均时薪比2014年5月高了2.3 % ； 但是，自今年年初以来，时薪增加了3.3 % ， 光是5月就增加了3.8 % — —这是充分就业的明确信号。	Consider this: Average hourly earnings in May were 2.3% higher than in May 2014; but, since the beginning of this year, hourly earnings are up 3.3%, and in May alone rose at a 3.8% rate – a clear sign of full employment.
另外，解剖学上的现代人与穴居人有一些共同的行为创新。 而许多人类学家和遗传学家都认为穴居人是一个不同的种群，或是一种在先天就达不到我们的认知能力的人类。	Moreover, anatomically modern populations shared a number of these innovations with Neanderthals, which many anthropologists and geneticists consider a different species, or a human type inherently incapable of reaching our cognitive level.
日本的另一个教训是，一个拥有巨额储蓄盈余的国家有能力应付大量的公共债务，因为它可以实现内部融资，但这并不一定意味着提升负债就是可取的。	Another lesson from Japan is that a country with a large savings surplus can handle a large public debt, because it can be financed internally. That does not necessarily mean that it is desirable to run up the debt.
据我对危机前日本、美国和南欧的巨大信用泡沫以及央行在过去几年中所采取的激进政策的观察，我怀疑这一理论的正确性。	In view of the huge credit bubble that preceded the crisis in Japan, the United States, and southern Europe, and the aggressive policies pursued by central banks over the last few years, I doubt that this theory is correct.
人们只要看一看斯里兰卡就可以了。 那里，在佛教僧伽罗人和印度教的坦米尔人慢燃的内战中，佛教被用作种族沙文主义。	One need only look at Sri Lanka, where Buddhism is lashed to ethnic chauvinism in the slow-burning civil war between Buddhist Singhalese and Hindu Tamils.
在法国总统萨科齐的领导下，G20已将减少食品价格波动列为今年头等大事，并在最近的巴黎G20农业部长会议上给出了解决方案。	Consumers are hurting worldwide, especially the poor, for whom food takes a major bite out of household budgets. Popular discontent over food prices has fueled political instability in some countries, most notably in Egypt and Tunisia.
国际移民组织委员会（International Organization for Migration Council）也在11月通过了类似的决议，该动议还获得了公民社会团体和国际组织的更多支持。	The International Organization for Migration Council issued a similar resolution in November, and the campaign has attracted additional support from civil-society groups and international organizations.
我在自己 2003 年出版的《金融新秩序：管理 21 世纪的风险》一书中，提出了另外一个不同的想法，我称之为“生计保险 ” 。	In my 2003 book, New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century, I proposed a different idea, which I called “livelihood insurance.”
梅在6月提前举行的大选的重大决定让她的反对派有机会要求英国去谈判一个类似于挪威作为欧洲经济区（EEA）成员的过渡性安排。	May’s fateful decision to hold an early election in June has allowed her opponents to demand that the UK negotiate a transitional arrangement similar to what Norway has as a member of the European Economic Area.
这将使非洲一跃成为全球疫苗免疫联盟的第四大投资主体 — — 仅次于英国、比尔及梅林达·盖茨基金会和挪威。	This will make Africa the fourth-largest investor in GAVI, behind only the United Kingdom, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Norway.
无论情况如何，对包括马塞夫在内的巴西左派领导者来说，资本主义是解决问题的一部分，而并非是根本问题本身。	Whatever the case, for key leaders of the Brazilian left, including Rousseff, capitalism became part of the solution, not the fundamental problem.
每年死于结核病的400,000儿童有多少本来可以长大成人，通过艺术、社会活动和商业为社会平等而战，并激励我们其他人加入到这项事业当中？	How many of the 400,000 children who die from TB each year could grow up, fight for social justice through art, activism, and commerce, and inspire the rest of us to do the same?
该决议只能影响美国制裁，而不能让协议作废，事实证明，其他所有国际力量取消制裁便足以促使伊朗不再讨价还价。	Given that the resolution would affect only US sanctions, it might not nullify the agreement, with the lifting of sanctions by all other international powers proving sufficient motivation for Iran to uphold its end of the bargain.
除了用北方（Nord Stream）和南方（South Stream）管网将乌克兰与俄罗斯对欧能源出口分离，克里姆林宫还成功地阻止了欧洲与富于能源的里海和中亚的联系。	Apart from using the Nord Stream and South Stream pipelines to disconnect Ukraine from Russian energy exports to Europe, the Kremlin successfully blocked European access to the hydrocarbon-rich Caspian Sea and Central Asia.
这对于南欧来说是一件大好事，南欧需要提高出口，但这只有在其他国家 — — 如最大的北欧经济体 — — 增加进口的情况下才能实现。	It would be good for Southern Europe, which needs to export more, but can only do so if someone else, like the largest Northern European economy, imports more.
在这一点上，我们必须承认把发明（比如）新软件的时间用于和朋友们摆龙门阵是不理性（除非你们的谈资有利于发明 ） 。	At that point, we must admit that it is irrational to spend time on long conversations with friends if it is time stolen from inventing, say, new software (unless the conversation helps the invention).
对此一系列来自世界银行和俄罗斯的研究都预计，如果俄罗斯成功加入WTO，其国家经济发展水平将在此后5年内每年额外增加0.5~1个百分点。	A series of World Bank and Russian studies have estimated that Russia can gain 0.5-1.0 percentage points in economic growth for half a decade if it joins the WTO.
1980和1990年代的政府无能和经济下滑迫使尼日利亚的领导人更多关注周边的问题，如利比里亚和塞拉利昂的内战。	Inept government and economic decline in the 1980’s and 1990’s obliged Nigeria’s leaders to focus on problems closer to home, like the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
芝加哥 — — 在金融危机发生之前，美国两大房屋抵押贷款机构“房利美”与“房地美”都得到政府的支持，在美国两党的怂恿下，这两个贷款机构向选区内的低收入家庭提供贷款。	CHICAGO – Before the recent financial crisis, politicians on both sides of the aisle in the United States egged on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant government-backed mortgage agencies, to support low-income lending in their constituencies.
南非拥有世界最大的铬和锰储量，它们是制造电动汽车、风力涡轮和其他所谓的第四次工业革命技术的必不可少的要素。	South Africa has some of the world’s largest deposits of chrome and manganese, minerals that are essential for the manufacture of electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other components of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution.
冷战结束后，不结盟运动已经分裂成由古巴、朝鲜、委内瑞拉等国的左派政权，以及波斯湾的沙特阿拉伯、巴林、卡塔尔等保守君主制国家组成的更加异端的组织。	Since the Cold War’s end, it has fractured into a far more heterodox grouping whose members range from leftist regimes, as in Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela, to the conservative monarchies (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar) of the Persian Gulf.
但是在几年以前，丹麦经济委员会对风轮机行业进行了一次全面的评估，不仅考虑了它在就业岗位和生产上所产生的有益效应，同时也考虑了它所获得的补贴。	A few years ago, however, the Danish Economic Council conducted a full evaluation of the wind turbine industry, taking into account not only its beneficial effects on jobs and production, but also the subsidies that it receives.
伊朗认为它是国际双重标准的受害者 — — 国际社会接受了巴基斯坦和印度的核地位，更不要提以色列了 — — 而这只会增强其受到歧视的感觉以及继续其野心的决心。	Iran believes that it is the victim of an international double standard – acceptance of Pakistan’s and India’s nuclear status, not to mention Israel’s – which only fuels its sense of discrimination and its resolve to pursue its ambitions.
1989年以来 — — 特别是2004年它们加入欧盟以后 — — 它们从欧洲结构和凝聚力基金等大规模金融转移支付中获益良多。	Since 1989 – and particularly since 2004, when they joined the EU – they have benefited from massive financial transfers in the form of European structural and cohesion funds.
这进一步证实了接触前预防（PrEP）技术的有效性，该技术旨在让艾滋病毒测试阴性者利用抗逆转录病毒药物保护自己远离感染威胁。	This is further evidence of the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a technique by which people who are HIV-negative use antiretroviral drugs to protect themselves from infection.
津巴布韦的邻国同样面临着一个抉择：它们可以利用它们的邻国地位制止穆加贝滥用暴力，也可以保护他免受国际监督和指责。	Zimbabwe’s neighbors also face a choice: they can use their proximity to halt Mugabe’s abuses, or to shield him from international scrutiny and rebuke.
"如果说这种发展还不足以代表非洲""硅谷""的出现，但非洲要想变得繁荣这些高技术产业的萌芽无疑是可以也必须加以培育的。"	"If not quite representing an African ""Silicon Valley,"" these shoots of high-tech industry nonetheless can and must be nurtured if Africa is to thrive."
有效税收制度的一个一般原则是以对总体经济扭曲程度尽可能小的方式征收给定数量（对应政府长期支出水平）的税额。	A general principle for an efficient tax system is to collect a given amount of revenue (corresponding in the long run to the government’s spending) in a way that causes as little distortion as possible to the overall economy.
此外，吸引更多的直接投资也很重要，考虑到在当前经济复苏过程中资本流入低于危机前水平的70 % ； 资本流出超过资本流入，意大利已经成为了净资本出口国。	Furthermore, attracting more direct investment is crucial, given that capital inflows, while recovering, remain 30% below their pre-crisis level; with outflows exceeding inflows, Italy has become a net capital exporter.
同时，新的信息技术让我们更清楚地意识到向印度和中国转移的工作都是高质量的，由受过良好教育和技术熟练的人从事的工作。	At the same time, the new information technology makes us more aware that the kinds of jobs that are migrating to India and China are high-quality jobs, the jobs for educated and skilled people.
这并不是说美国永远不应该支持反对现任政府的暴动，但这样做几乎永远是孤家寡人，几乎无法指望此过程中出现多少盟友。	This is not to say that the US should never support insurgencies against established governments; but doing so is almost always a lonely affair, without any realistic expectation of enlisting many partners in the process.
“在不同国家、不同文化中寻找和支持民主运动和组织的发展是美国的既定国策 ， ” 布什宣称 ， “ 最终目标是在全球范围内消灭专政 。 ”	“It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture,” Bush declared, “with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.”
现在他宣布离任，我们只能希望莫迪及其政府确保下一任印度央行行长水平相近，有能力 — — 也有独立性 — — 来果断行动维护央行的可信度。	Now that he is gone, one can only hope that Modi and his government ensure that the next RBI governor is of comparable caliber, with the capability – and independence – to uphold the institution’s credibility through decisive action.
食品与燃料价格的飚升与主要自然灾难在很多方面都起到了重要的影响，如破坏金融市场与居民的购买能力，甚至是破坏了政治的稳定。	Soaring food and fuel prices and major natural disasters played an important role in undermining financial markets, household purchasing power, and even political stability.
自独立以来的50年里，有724万个工作被创造出来，增长率为261 % ， 约等于在美国创造了1.05亿份工作。	In the 50 years since independence, 7.24 million jobs have been created, an increase of 261%, which would be equivalent to the creation of 105 million jobs in the United States.
但在精英自我满足的自鸣得意中 — — 他们的收入和股票组合又开始飙涨了 — — 我们无法看到不同的政策。	But we will not find them in the self-satisfied complacency of the elites, whose incomes and stock portfolios are once again soaring.
目前美联储公开市场委员会预计它将在2018年年底将联邦基金利率提高到2.4 % ， 2019年年底提高到3.1 % ， 2020年年底提高到3.4 % 。	The Fed’s Open Market Committee has now projected that it will raise the federal funds rate to 2.4% by the end of 2018, to 3.1% by the end of 2019, and to 3.4% by the end of 2020.
从前那种只顾眼前利益的互动已经令双方都养成了一种难以更改的长期行为模式，致使双方更难从当今这种不可持续的均衡中脱身出来。	Myopic actions on both sides have helped entrench a longer-term pattern of behavior that only makes it harder to move away from today’s unsustainable equilibrium.
三十年来，森林采伐之势从未减小，而最新的阻止滥伐措施 — — 被称为“减少滥伐和毁林所致排放 ” （ Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation，REDD+ ） — —看上去也不太可能收到成效。	Since then, deforestation has continued unabated, and the latest international effort to stop it – an initiative known as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) – looks no more likely to be effective.
还有一些人持有一个更善意的观点：正如“非洲发展新伙伴计划 ” — —一个谋求增强非洲国家国际关系的泛非组织 — — 希望的那样，中非之间形成了合作关系。	Still others hold a more benign view: Sino-African relations constitute a partnership, in line with the New Partnership of Africa’s Development, a pan-African organization that seeks to empower African states in their international relations.
即使希拉里·克林顿赢得选举，他们也认为美国公众已经失去了对国际主义的偏好，美国将抛弃自由贸易和对外干预。	Even if Hillary Clinton wins the election, they think that the American public has lost its appetite for internationalism and that the country will turn its back on free trade and foreign intervention.
几个月来，亚努科维奇的“地区党”在民意调查中一直领先，而且人们应当记得，2004年尤先科是险胜亚努科维奇，而非大胜。	Yanukovych’s “Party of the Regions” has been leading in opinion polls for months, and the world should remember that Yushchenko’s ultimate triumph over him in 2004 was by a whisker, not a landslide.
拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）和蒂摩西·盖特纳（Timothy Geithner）都可能会支持现在盛行的国际双重标准，这一标准允许富裕国家在面临衰退时实行扩张性的财政政策，却迫使贫穷国家进一步紧缩开支。	Both men are likely to support the prevailing global double standard, which allows rich countries to use fiscal expansion in the face of recession, while forcing poor countries into greater austerity.
在新的权力版图中，处于中心的是两大主要阵营 — — 以SCAF为代表的军方和包括穆斯林兄弟会和沙拉菲派在内的伊斯兰主义者，处于周围的则是次要政党、青年联盟和其他团体。	The two most prominent actors in the new power spectrum – the military, represented by SCAF, and the Islamists, who include the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafists – are surrounded by lesser political parties, youth coalitions, and others.
富裕国家每年都要拿出1,300亿美元，不仅用于喂饱饥民，也用于建设重要基础设施和缩小教育、医疗和清洁水和卫生设施普及度的差距。	And rich countries give more than $130 billion each year not only to feed the starving, but also to build crucial infrastructure and reduce gaps in access to education, health care, and clean water and sanitation worldwide.
因此，我带着最高的乐观情绪 — — 这未必是完全天真的愿望 — — 希望所有东亚领导人都能拿出2015年的新年决心。	So, here – in a spirit of supreme, but perhaps not totally naive, optimism – are the 2015 New Year’s resolutions that I would most like each of East Asia’s leaders to make.
该声明的可信性直到后续调查的结果出来之后才被质疑。 调查显示该地区的毛死亡率较之正常的基本比率上升了六倍。	The claim sounded credible until the subsequent survey showed that the area’s crude mortality rate had actually risen to six times the normal base rate.
基于过去几年来支出增长的意外减速，国会预算办公室将这些项目的十年预测值降低了3.5 % ， 减少十年预算3820亿美元。	Based on the unexpected slowdown in spending growth during the last few years, the Congressional Budget Office recently cut its ten-year projections for these programs by 3.5%, reducing the ten-year deficit by $382 billion.
当然，对于如何划分对难民的责任，有明确的规则：根据所谓的都柏林规则（Dublin Regulation ） ， 难民所进入的第一个欧盟成员国必须对该难民的避难申请负责。	Of course, there are clear rules about how responsibility for refugees is delineated: according to the so-called Dublin Regulation, the first EU member state into which a refugee crosses is responsible for that person’s asylum application.
但随着突破性创新经验的积累，我逐渐意识到这是因为多数人都受到特定教条的束缚，于是让教条以外的创新方法变得遥远而模糊。	But, as my experience with entrepreneurial innovation has grown, I have realized that the response is rooted in the fact that most people are trapped in a specific doctrine, which obscures the innovative solutions that lie beyond its borders.
跨国水资源已成为特别活跃的竞争和冲突原因，引发了各国的建坝竞赛，越来越多的人呼吁联合国把水看做关键性安全问题。	Transnational water resources have become an especially active source of competition and conflict, triggering a dam-building race and prompting growing calls for the United Nations to recognize water as a key security concern.
发自伦敦 — — 在过去的两个月间，我曾经到过波士顿、纽约、华盛顿、休斯顿、芝加哥、洛杉矶、旧金山和西雅图等8个美国城市。	LONDON – In the last two months, I have been in eight American cities – Boston, New York, Washington, Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.
斯洛伐克总理拒绝难民的理由是“斯洛伐克是为斯洛伐克人而建，不是为少数群体而建 ， ” 这一理由难以服众。	A Slovak prime minister who rejects refugees on the grounds that “Slovakia is built for Slovaks, not for minorities” is hard to buy off.
2012年年中，家庭负债总水平是可支配收入的113 % ， 较2007年危机前的峰值水平134%下降了21个百分点，但仍远高于1970—1999年间的正常水平75 % 。	The overall level of household indebtedness stood at 113% of disposable personal income in mid-2012 – down 21 percentage points from its pre-crisis peak of 134% in 2007, but still well above the 1970-1999 norm of around 75%.
事实上如果一心追求高回报率的话，银行家们就会将股东们暴露在过度风险之下，却无法提供给他们足够的相应补偿。	In fact, in the single-minded quest for higher returns, bankers might expose shareholders to excessive risk, without compensating them adequately.
有些人提出欧洲应当参照自己的农业政策，引入一个类似共同农业政策这样的防御预算，让那些搭便车的欧洲国家也负起责任来。	Some argue that Europe needs to follow the example of its agricultural policy and introduce a CAP-style defense budget so that free-rider EU countries start to pay their way.
西方不应当坚持阻止理解伊斯兰运动复杂成分的世界末日的预言或者绝对性观点，而是需要继续对当前的政权施加压力来停止为了规避的目的而进行的政治改革。	Instead of sticking to doomsday prophecies or to categorical perspectives that prevent an understanding of the complex fabric of Islamic movements, the West needs to keep the pressure on the incumbent regimes to stop circumventing political reform.
现在，中国人民银行有三个选择：停止一切干预让人民币自由浮动；让人民币与一揽子货币挂钩；或紧紧盯住美元（和1997年亚洲金融危机期间一样 ） 。	The PBOC now has three options: it can stop all interventions and let the renminbi float; link it to a basket of currencies; or peg it tightly to the US dollar, as it did during the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
为了获得成功，金敬姬必须依靠三条权力线 — — 党、军队和中央政府，每一条线都深入到朝鲜人民日常生活的最细微之处。	To succeed, three lines of power emanate from Kim Kyong-hui – to the Party, the military, and the central government, with each line branching into the smallest corners of North Korean life.
在似乎看不到明显前进方向的情况下他以一句美国决策者最喜欢用的陈述作为结尾 ： “ 所有选择都摆在桌面上 ， ” 这句话隐含的意思是同样应当将军事行动纳入考虑的范畴。	He concluded with a favorite statement of American policymakers when there seems no obvious way forward: “all options are on the table,” he said, implying that military action should also be considered.
这派患上妄想恐惧症的伊斯兰人，如披着强硬派的外衣的伊斯兰传道会为代表，是巴基斯坦发展最快的宗教派别。	This paranoid Islam, represented by hard-line outfits like the Tablighi Jamaat, is Pakistan’s fastest-growing brand of faith.
但国会不太可能批准这些措施，且��体财政政策也非常具有收缩性，这导致今年经济增长率降低了大约1.5个百分点。	Yet Congressional approval is unlikely, and overall fiscal policy remains strongly contractionary, reducing growth by about 1.5 percentage points this year.
尽管如此，最近的价格疯狂蔓延到了众多尚在人世的艺术家，首屈一指的是美国人杰夫·昆斯（Jeff Koons）和德国人格哈德·里希特（Gerhard Richter ） ， 并且波及许多名声并不那么响亮的艺术家。	Nevertheless, the recent price frenzy extends to a significant number of living artists, led by the American Jeff Koons and the German Gerhard Richter, and extending well down the food chain.
奥巴马认为，如此专制援助是对西方地缘战略利益，包括反毒品斗争的一种严重挑战（几内亚已经成为南美到欧洲运毒路线上的中转国 ） 。	As Obama understands, such authoritarian aid is a serious challenge to the West’s geo-strategic interests, including the fight against drug traffic (Guinea has become a transit point on the route from South America to Europe).
随着高粮价使得这些地区的农民获得收益，他们将提高产量作为回应，也最终会缩小供求缺口并增加库存使用比率。	To the extent that higher commodity prices benefit farmers in these regions, they will respond by increasing their production, which will eventually reduce scarcity, increase stocks-to-use ratios, and attenuate the higher prices.
事实证明了显示菲永处于第三且与前两位差距巨大的民调结果错误，部分原因可能是许多投票者似乎是在投票前几天才做出决定的。	Opinion polls placing Fillon as a distant third were proven wrong, partly because many voters seem to have made up their minds just days before the vote.
绝大多数的美国人认为这非常不公平，特别是他们看到银行接受到数百亿美元救助后，忙着给自己支付巨额的奖金和分红之后。	Most Americans view it as grossly unjust, especially after they saw the banks divert the billions intended to enable them to revive lending to payments of outsized bonuses and dividends.
巴黎—自2012年7月欧洲央行行长德拉吉发出著名的声音，承诺“不惜一切代价”拯救共同货币以来，欧洲领导人便不再关注欧元区的未来。	PARIS – European leaders have devoted scant attention to the future of the eurozone since July 2012, when Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank’s president, famously committed to do “whatever it takes” to save the common currency.
作为保守派标志性人物，罗纳德·里根（Ronald Reagan）在其20世纪80年代担任美国总统期间将其财政政策描述为“饿死官僚巨兽 ” ： 减税将最终迫使人们接受更少的政府开支。	As US President in the 1980’s, the conservative icon Ronald Reagan described his approach to fiscal policy as “starve the beast”: cutting taxes will eventually force people to accept less government spending.
相对于物质需求，示威者们更加关注政治和经济方面的自由，反映出民众已经敏锐地意识到这些物质需要只不过是缺乏政治和经济自由所导致的症状和后果而已。	The protests are much more about political and economic freedom than about material needs, reflecting a keen awareness that such needs are merely a symptom and consequence of the absence of political and economic freedom.
在繁荣期，这似乎无关紧要；但是，德格雷戈里奥明白，新兴市场 — — 和发达国家 — — 的压力往往会在出乎意料的时刻出现。	In a boom, this may seem irrelevant; but, as De Gregorio knows, pressure on emerging markets – and richer countries – arises all too often, and frequently at unexpected moments.
在小型和中等规模的企业（SMEs）或者非正规部门工人基本上没机会到该系统受训，对此的公共投入也捉襟见肘。	TVET is rarely available to workers in small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) or the informal sector, and it receives too little public financing.
希腊GDP也许只占欧元区的2 % ， 但追求短视的“临时”方针解决希腊问题可能树立一个让整个货币联盟毁于一旦的先例。	Greece may account for less than 2% of eurozone GDP, but the pursuit of shortsighted ad hoc solutions to its problems may set precedents that could bring down the entire monetary union.
坐视不理意味着叙利亚解体、在流血事件中四分五裂、威胁到所有周边国家的安全、让恐怖主义浪潮席卷整个区域。	Doing nothing would mean Syria’s disintegration, divided in blood, with the countries around it destabilized and waves of terrorism rolling over the region.
我们和从前一样有能力让所有人过上高质量生活 — — 我的意思是，比20年前质量更高的生活 — — 并且很快就能学会创造更高质量的生活。	We are as capable as before of affording for everyone a high standard of life – high, I mean, compared with, say, 20 years ago – and will soon learn to afford a standard higher still.
欧洲官员和IMF一样，都知道希腊处于这一状况已有相当长的时间，早就沦为永久性“病危国家 ” （ ward of the state ） ， 而其所在的欧元区无法很好地协调这个结果。	European officials know as well as the IMF does that Greece has long been at this stage, turning the country into a permanent “ward of the state” within a eurozone that does not accommodate this outcome well.
虽然也不是没有可以挑毛病的地方（有人说新计划只是削减现有再培训计划资金的借口 ） ， 但数字平台可以大规模改善再教育和培训的想法是靠谱的。	While it is easy to be cynical (some say the new program is just an excuse to cut funds from existing retraining programs), the idea that digital platforms can massively improve re-education and training is a good one.
据《卫报》近日报道 ， “ 国防部长麦克瑞维奇的重要副手考纳茨基曾在2012俄大选期间任波兰国际观察员职务 。 ”	The Guardian recently reported that, “Bartosz Kownacki, a key lieutenant of defense minister Antoni Macierewicz, was a member of a group of Polish international observers during Russia’s 2012 election.”
如果看不到这样的前景，没有一个候选国家会愿意经历采纳Acquis Communautaire（欧盟的法律集成）中成千上万条法令和规章的痛苦过程。	Without that prospect, no candidate country would go through the painful process of adopting the tens of thousands of rules and regulations contained in the Acquis Communautaire (the body of EU law).
想象一下这个场景：一辆汽车正向一堵墙撞过去，车上的乘客就是消费者和投资者，这个时候，要让乘客安心，司机非得踩刹车不可。	Consider the following image: consumers and investors as passengers in a car hurtling directly toward a brick wall. In this case, the driver stepping on the brake will give the passengers more confidence.
对人类而言，最严重的环境问题是利用木材和牛粪等肮脏燃料烹饪和取暖所造成的室内空气污染 — — 而这种污染来源于贫困。	The most serious environmental problem for humans is indoor air pollution from cooking and heating with dirty fuels like wood and dung – which is the result of poverty.
发自伦敦 — — 如今人们已经对美联储“缩减”资产收购计划的步骤进行了充分的讨论，而注意力也将逐渐转向对利率上升的预期方面。	LONDON – Now that the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s “tapering” of its asset-purchase program has been debated to death, attention will increasingly turn to prospects for interest-rate increases.
他们甚至将某印度国家队队员和流亡分子伊布拉西姆（Dawood Ibrahim）联系在一起，后者被广泛认为是1993年孟买爆炸案的嫌疑主谋，现藏身于巴基斯坦。	They have even linked a player for India’s national team to the fugitive Dawood Ibrahim, widely suspected of being the architect of the 1993 Bombay bombings, who has been hiding in Pakistan.
似乎只要大部分人相信他们能够获得实质性的好处，技术官僚主义就可以很好地运转，这就是欧洲发生了50年、并在中国继续发生着的事情。	Technocracy, it seems, can work well as long as most people feel that they are benefiting materially, as was true in Europe for almost 50 years, and might still be true in China.
纽约—正在乌克兰逐渐升级的冲突 — — 一方是西方支持的政府，另一方是俄罗斯支持的分裂主义者 — — 让人们开始关注一个根本问题：克里姆林宫的长期目标是什么？	NEW YORK – The escalating conflict in Ukraine between the Western-backed government and Russian-backed separatists has focused attention on a fundamental question: What are the Kremlin’s long-term objectives?
他们的办法 — — 现在称为“全球治理 ” — —建立一套能够促进国际合作、健全全球共同规范、制定全球适用的可预测的规则，从而造福全人类的制度基础上。	Their idea – now called “global governance” – was to create an institutional architecture that could foster international cooperation, elaborate consensual global norms, and establish predictable, universally applicable rules, to the benefit of all.
而在佐治亚州第六选区席位的争夺中，民主党人乔恩·奥苏夫（Jon Ossoff）获得了比其他任何候选人都多的票数，仅差一点未能达到他所需要的50%的完胜标准。	And in the race for Georgia’s 6th district seat, Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, gained more votes than any other candidate, falling just short of the 50% threshold that he needed to win outright.
有三个根本性问题因素将决定一国主权债务的发展状况：经济发展速率；借债成本；以及该国的基本预算状况（除利息支付之外的预算平衡状况 ） 。	There are three fundamental factors that determine the evolution of a country’s sovereign debt: its rate of economic growth; its borrowing costs; and its primary budget position (the budget balance net of interest payments).
向欧盟规则和监管的靠拢过程是痛苦的，但帮助波兰在20世纪90年代成为正常欧洲国家，如今也可以帮助乌克兰治理其贿赂、任人唯亲和裙带关系等问题。	The painstaking approximation of EU rules and regulation that helped Poland become a normal European country by the late 1990’s would offer Ukraine the prospect of taming its own demons of bribery, cronyism, and nepotism.
学校世界（A World of School）组织正在募集史上最大规模请愿以支持有教无类的千年发展目标。	The organization A World at School is now circulating the biggest-ever petition in support of the Millennium Development Goal of universal education.
有人或许会认为银行会抵消共同基金行业的游说努力，因为迫使货币市场基金支付更多系统成本可能会扩大直接流入银行的资金流。	One might think that banks would counter-balance the mutual-fund industry’s lobbying efforts, because the likely effect of forcing money-market funds to pay for more of their systemic costs would be to expand funds flowing directly to banks.
和特朗普一样，科雷拉有时候也会走上电视或广播节目指名道姓批评记者；他的政府也一再将新闻组织诉上法庭。	Like Trump, Correa would sometimes go on television or radio programs to denounce journalists by name; and his government repeatedly took news organizations to court.
审判结果尚无定论，但是从历史先例看，对独裁或半独裁领导人发起严峻挑战往往会导致政权更加强硬，而不是让执政者更加温和。	The jury is still out, but judging from previous historical examples, serious challenges to authoritarian or semi-authoritarian leaders usually lead to a hardening of the regime, not greater moderation.
但是他们的研究结论不应是对我们所感兴趣的经济和金融力量的唯一描述，而一直以来泰勒都是一项已经证明这一观点的行为研究计划的主要贡献者。	But their results are not the only descriptions of economic and financial forces that should interest us, and Thaler has been a major contributor to a behavioral research program that has demonstrated this.
柏林—自二十年前弗朗西斯·福山（Francis Fukuyama）提出世界已达到历史的终结以来，历史便让世界扼住了它的呼吸。	BERLIN – Ever since Francis Fukuyama argued, more than two decades ago, that the world had reached the end of history, history has made the world hold its breath.
芝加哥—你大概以为，有60万评论的请愿书足以让一个问题成为美国证券和交易委员会（SEC）日程的优先项。	CHICAGO – You would think that 600,000 comments on a petition would be sufficient to bring an issue to the top of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s agenda.
自20世纪80年代以来，发生了某种形式的“认知俘虏 ” （ cognitive capture ） ， 决策者认定创新和去监管化必能改善金融中介和整体经济的功能。	Since the 1980’s, a form of “cognitive capture” had occurred, with policymakers becoming convinced that innovation and deregulation could only improve the functioning of both financial intermediation and the broader economy.
如果我们用种族或民族分类，就会发现美国白人支持特朗普的优势为21个百分点，而西班牙裔和非洲裔美国人支持克林顿的优势分别为36和80个百分点。	If we sort by race or ethnicity, we find that white Americans favored Trump by 21 points, while Hispanics and African-Americans favored Clinton by 36 points and 80 points, respectively.
在爱葡两国救援计划结束前很久，欧洲央行便已经开始在二级市场购买两国债务，作为其“量化宽松”计划的一部分。	The ECB had already begun purchasing Irish and Portuguese debt in the secondary markets well before these countries’ bailout exit, as part of its “quantitative easing” program.
尽管面临着这些远远高于通信业的风险，但非洲小农仍表现出与中农富农等量齐观的效率 — — 这充分证明了他们的坚忍不拔。	Despite these risks, which dwarf those faced by the telecoms industry, Africa’s smallholders remain as efficient as their larger counterparts – a testament to their tenacity and resilience.
虽然每一位日本公民的看法会各不相同，但大多数民众似乎都明确赞同日本必须成为一个在促进国际和地区性安全及经济增长方面作用显著的国家。	Every Japanese citizen may have his or her own opinion, but a clear majority appear to agree that Japan must become a prominent nation in promoting international and regional security, as well as economic growth.
中国和印度深知这一点：在不到15年的时间内，它们将占到全球研发投入的20 % ， 比当前的比重多一倍多。	China and India have learned that lesson well. In less than 15 years, they will account for 20% of global spending on investment in research and development, more than twice their current share.
此外，结构性失业及工人重新安置费用可���通过强大的社会安全网来缓解，其中包括有针对性的劳动者重新安置资金，让劳动者们可以重新站稳脚跟自食其力。	Moreover, structural unemployment and worker resettlement costs can be mitigated with a strong social safety net that includes funds for targeted labor redeployment so that workers can get back on their feet.
换句话说，国际货币基金组织必须确保以相同的方式对待各国，包括提供清晰而在某些时候是困难的政策信息，并且与国际社会分享它的观点。	In other words, the Fund must ensure that it deals with every country the same way, including delivering clear and sometimes difficult policy messages and sharing its views with the international community.
各国会对1999年协议进行周期性的修订，但自 2014 年出台最新版本以来，大多数富裕国家的黄金储备销售都被长时间暂缓，令它们依然保有极大量的黄金储备。	The 1999 pact has been revisited periodically, though since the most recent edition in 2014, most rich countries have taken a long pause, still leaving them with extremely high gold reserves.
Dotcom的律师辩称Megaupload只提供存储空间存储订阅者的文件，根本无法控制他们的存储内容。	Dotcom’s lawyer claims that Megaupload was merely providing storage for its subscribers’ files, and had no control over what they were storing.
对此目前支持选择性实施资本管制的国际货币基金组织（IMF）似乎并未察觉：在其发布年度总结回顾中还认为卢比被恰当地估价的。	The International Monetary Fund, which now supports selective imposition of capital controls, seems unconcerned: the rupee, its annual review concludes, is fairly valued.
一个理直气壮的回答是集中在对付夺走最多人生命的疾病上 — — 比如疟疾、麻疹和痢疾，这些疾病在发展中国家夺走数百万人的生命，但在发达国家中几乎无人因此丧生。	There is a strong argument for tackling the diseases that kill the most people –diseases like malaria, measles, and diarrhea, which kill millions in developing countries, but very few in the developed world.
因此，当特朗普履新时，他继承的是在奥巴马手上翻了一番的国民债务、迅速升高的利率，以及资金不足的社保和医保成本。	As a result, when Trump came to office, he inherited a national debt that had doubled on Obama’s watch, rapidly rising interest rates, and unfunded Social Security and Medicare costs.
如果这仍然是美国的态度，那么建立今天互联世界所需要的秩序就只有在其他主要国家的推动下 — — 或者被迫等待特朗普的继任者 — — 才能产生。	If this remains the US approach, progress toward building the sort of order that today’s interconnected world demands will come about only if other major powers push it – or it will have to wait for Trump’s successor.
尽管公司盈利强劲 — — 美国的减税政策令公司盈利锦上添花 — — 但美国和全球股市在最近几个月中显出疲态。	Despite strong corporate earnings – which have been goosed by the US tax cuts – US and global equity markets have drifted sideways in recent months.
全球化 — — 不管以移民形式还是以贸易、资本和数据流形式表现 — — 也构成了一个同样规模的挑战，尽管在近几十年中，德国从全球化中受益良多。	Globalization – whether it takes the form of migration or flows of trade, capital, and data – poses an equally large challenge, even though it has been a boon to Germany in recent decades.
但是，对新兴市场资产的需求不是无限的，它们同发达经济体资产也并非可以完全替代 — — 即便存在利率差。 因为两种资产的流动性和信贷风险不可同日而语。	But the demand for emerging-market assets is neither infinite nor perfectly substitutable for the assets of advanced economies – even for given interest-rate differentials – because these assets have very different liquidity and credit risks.
研究人员、制药公司和人权活动家必须担负起确保 PrEP能够普及的斗争责任 — — 让最需要的群体不冒任何风险就能得到它。	Researchers, drug companies, and human-rights campaigners must take up the fight to ensure that PrEP is made available – without risk – to those who need it most.
作为交换，朝鲜将获得两座用于发电的轻水核反应堆，外加每年50万吨原油供应，直到第一座反应堆开始运转发电为止。	In exchange, two light-water nuclear reactors would be built to generate electric energy, and 500,000 metric tons of oil would be supplied annually until the first reactor began operating.
低收入国家往往人均固定资本（计算机、工厂、基础设施）和人力资本（教育和培训）极低，因此资本投资回报潜力较高。	Given that low-income economies typically have little fixed capital (computers, factories, infrastructure) and human capital (education and training) per worker, they tend to have higher potential returns to capital investment.
为219名尼日利亚女孩斗争的运动 — — 她们之所以被绑架，只是因为她们想上学 — — 是这场自由战争的标志性战役。	The campaign for the 219 Nigerian girls – kidnapped simply because they wanted to go to school – is an iconic battle of this freedom struggle.
关于青少年健康的数据可以让政府和其他机构为亲少年制定有效和有针对性的方案，从而在确保更美好的未来中扮演关键角色。	By enabling governments and others to design effective and targeted health programs for adolescents, data on adolescent health can play a critical role in securing a better future.
在法律理论中 ， “ 正义”包含两个要素：实质正义，涉及到法律的内容及其运用的公平性；以及天然或程序正义，涉及到决策的公平性和透明性。	In legal theory, “justice” comprises two components: substantive justice, which concerns a law’s content and the fairness of its application, and natural or procedural justice, which concerns the fairness and transparency of how decisions are made.
例如，除非我们大幅度改变我们生产电力、驱动汽车以及给我们的建筑物供热和降温的方式，否则就无法继续安全地扩大全球能源使用。	There is no way, for example, to continue expanding the global use of energy safely unless we drastically alter how we produce electricity, power automobiles, and heat and cool our buildings.
但近几年来，中国一直在蚕食印度对马尔代夫的影响，以此作为其“珍珠链”计划的一部分，即建立一个军事基地和经济项目链，在印度洋部署中国力量。	But, in recent years, China has been eroding India’s influence in the Maldives, as part of its effort to build its “string of pearls”: a chain of military installations and economic projects aimed at projecting Chinese power in the Indian Ocean.
奥巴马也在强调美国“重心”的经济方面，将其亚洲之行描述意在为通过增加对“世界增长最快、最有活力的地区的出口”来早就更多国内制造业岗位。	Obama, too, is highlighting the economic aspects of the US “pivot,” portraying his Asia tour as an effort to generate more domestic manufacturing jobs through higher exports to “the most rapidly growing and dynamic region in the world.”
印尼在不到18个月时间里签署了一百部法律，这些法律涉及媒体选举自由、腐败、权力下放和反垄断规则的方方面面。	In Indonesia, we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months, covering everything from media freedom to elections, corruption, decentralization, and anti-trust rules.
在2007年危机前的泡沫时期，欧元区外围国家物价和工资升高迅猛，相比而言，德国陷入了高失业和工资停滞。	During the bubble years before the 2007 crisis, prices and wages increased sharply in the eurozone periphery, relative to Germany, which was plagued by high unemployment and stagnant wages.
他已经加强了欧洲和其他地方许多人的立场，这些人对否定国家领土完整表示怀疑，或者依旧宣称相信可以谈判解决问题。	He has strengthened the position of many in Europe and elsewhere who are skeptical of challenging a country’s territorial integrity or who still claim to believe in a negotiated settlement.
首先，关注的焦点不应该是疾病普遍性的下降，而是疾病负担 — — 用致残和致过早死亡的标准来衡量 — — 的下降。	First, the primary concern should not be with reducing disease prevalence, but rather disease burden – the health impact as measured by disability and premature mortality.
我们被告知说自由是好的 ， “ 但是”一个人是不能在一个缺乏共产主义国家意识的个人主义社会中生存的；我们被告知说民主是伟大的 ， “ 但是”只能服务于工人阶级的利益。	Then we were told that freedom is good, but that one can’t live in an individualist society without common concern for the communist state. Democracy is great, but only in the interests of the working class.
如果将“超越合理怀疑”的证明负担降低到民事案件那样的“证据优势 ” ， 国家完成任务的难度将会大大降低。	If that burden of proof – “beyond a reasonable doubt” – were lowered to, say, “a preponderance of the evidence,” as it is in civil cases, the state would have an easier task.
自2003年以来，东非地区记录了8个最温暖年份，毫无疑问，这与困扰非洲之角1300万人的大饥荒密切相关。	Since 2003, East Africa has had the eight warmest years on record, which is no doubt contributing to the severe famine that now afflicts 13 million people in the Horn of Africa.
内塔尼亚胡和其国防部长埃胡德•巴拉克一道已经成功地让奥巴马以及世界其他国家相信，如果美国及其盟友不及时阻止伊朗的核进程，以色列最终将采取军事行动。	Together with his defense minister, Ehud Barak, Netanyahu succeeded in persuading Obama and the rest of the world that Israel was preparing a military attack as a last resort, should the US and its allies fail to stop the Iranian program in time.
不仅如此，所谓的“专利丛林”¾也就是害怕研究过程中的某些进展会在创新者自己都不知情的情况下践踏业已存在的专利¾也会阻碍创新的产生。	Moreover, so-called “patent thickets” – the fear that some advance will tread on pre-existing patents, of which the innovator may not even be aware – may also discourage innovation.
而总负担 — — 包括失业 — — 几乎肯定将主要落在穷人头上，而相信债务是免费午餐的民粹主义者心安理得地忽视这一事实。	And the overall burden, including unemployment, would almost surely fall disproportionately on the poor, a fact that populists who believe that debt is a free lunch conveniently ignore.
为了破解这个短期资本流动和过度外汇储备累积的不稳定怪圈，国际货币资金组织，在G20集团的广泛支持下，必须制定一系列关于货币政策溢出效应的新规则。	In order to break the destabilizing cycle of short-term capital flows and excessive accumulation of foreign reserves, the International Monetary Fund, with broad support from the G-20, must devise new rules regarding monetary-policy spillovers.
当时，身居缅甸需要如履薄冰，因为政府对你如何界定该国的问题 — — 即使是贫困、农业生产率低下、劳动力素质不高这样的问题 — — 颇为敏感。	At that time, one had to be careful, given the government’s sensitivities, even about how one framed the country’s problems – its poverty, lack of rural productivity, and unskilled workforce.
中国的务实领导人知道，美国的存在有助于遏制苏联（以及随后的俄罗斯 ） 、 防止日本重新武装、保持海路开放。	China’s pragmatic leaders knew that the US presence helped to contain the Soviet Union (and subsequently Russia), prevented Japan from re-arming, and kept sea-lanes open.
但是，在民主党中间，这一机会的诱惑要大得多；事实上，避免与华尔街起冲突也许会给候选人造成问题（希拉里·克林顿大概很认同这一点 ） 。	Among the Democrats, however, the opportunity seems to be much more compelling; indeed, avoiding a confrontation with Wall Street might actually create problems for a candidate (as Hillary Clinton may well find out).
该战略提出要培养欧盟战略自主（strategic autonomy）的雄心，这是推进我们的人民的利益以及我们的原则和价值观的必要条件。	The Strategy nurtures the ambition of strategic autonomy for the EU, which is necessary to promote our citizens’ common interests, as well as our principles and values.
纵使他已经不怎么再提自己的有条件下台承诺；但如果选民否决了参议院改革议案，他将成为一个跛脚鸭总理，到时就只能下台，否则就会威胁政治稳定。	Renzi has vigorously backpedaled from his conditional vow to step down; but if voters reject the Senate reform, he will become a lame duck, and political stability will most likely suffer unless he keeps his promise.
最初迹象显示对住房价格期货交易的兴趣越来越浓，特别是关于“房产泡沫”的言论甚嚣尘上，更加突出了风险多样化的重要性。	Initial indications suggest growing interest in futures trading for home prices, particularly as so much talk about the “housing bubble” underscores the importance of diversifying risk.
这是个及时的行动，因为过去15年中，强制处理美国联邦氦储备系统的巨量氦储备让美国中西部的大量氦生产商倒闭，也让其他地方的工程推迟（见图 ） 。	The move is timely, because the mandated disposal of such a large volume of helium from the US Federal Helium Reserve over the last 15 years has displaced many helium producers in the American Midwest and deferred projects elsewhere (see graph).
巴黎—本周早些时候，在经历了几天的激烈讨论后，雅典新政府与其欧元区债权人达成了一份协议，协议包括立刻采取一揽子改革和将金融援助延长四个月。	PARIS – Earlier this week, following days of tense discussions, the new government in Athens reached an agreement with its eurozone creditors that includes a package of immediate reforms and a four-month extension of the financial assistance program.
至少从托马斯·阿奎那的《神学大全 》 （ Summa Theologica，1265—1274年）出版以来，自然定律和黄金规则（Golden Rule）就被认为是教会理论的基本支柱。	At least since the publication of Thomas Aquinas’s Summa Theologica (1265-74), natural law and the Golden Rule have been viewed as the fundamental pillars of the Church’s teachings.
死亡人数极高，幸存者的身体和情感苦难以及由大海啸所带来的财产损失也十分巨大。 甚至，其他可能性低（但并非可以忽略）的或者不得而知的的灾难可能会造成更大的损失。	Great as the death toll, physical and emotional suffering of survivors, and property damage caused by the tsunami were, even greater losses could be inflicted by other disasters of low (but not negligible), or unknown, probability.
我们应该记得一位突尼斯水果商人的自焚引发了最近这场革命���这名商人自焚是因为不堪忍受政府的侮辱和骚扰。	The recent revolutions, it should be recalled, started with the self-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor, who was harassed and insulted by the authorities.
克里姆林宫继续支持着叙利亚巴沙尔·阿萨德政权，充当着军事干预的顽固障碍，寻求捍卫其自身的战略利益（包括在叙利亚城市塔尔图斯的海军基地 ） 。	The Kremlin continues to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, maintaining a strict aversion to military intervention and seeking to defend its strategic interests, including its naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus.
机构投资者通常认为多边金融机构投资规模过小，风险太大或盈利不足，他们担心一旦出现问题多边金融机构的官僚架构会拖延问题的迅速解决。	Institutional investors often consider the projects MFIs pitch to be too small, too risky, or not profitable enough, and they worry that, if something goes wrong, MFIs’ bureaucracies will not permit them to address it swiftly.
除此之外，应该辅之以高负债国家 — — 可��义为债务-GDP之比高于（比如）60%或70%的国家 — — 一定比例负债的共同化和温和减记，替之以长期零息债券。	This should be combined with the mutualization of some portion of the liabilities of highly indebted countries – defined as a debt-to-GDP ratio above, say, 60% or 70% – and modest write-downs in exchange for long-term zero-coupon bonds.
随着英国银行部门竞争力因此下降，恢复当初导致危���的轻触式（light-touch）监管的诱惑可能增加。	As the UK banking sector’s competitiveness suffers, the temptation to return to the kind of light-touch regulation that enabled the crisis in the first place could intensify.
它反映了国会共和党领导层的意愿，包括22名一周前致信特朗普的共和党参议员，他们在信中要求他退出巴黎协定。	It reflected the will of the Republican leadership in Congress, including the 22 Republican senators who sent Trump a letter the week before, calling on him to withdraw from the Paris accord.
对世界其他地区来说，周永康丑闻的发酵确认了一个影响深远又令人担心的事实：这个中央王国依然是深度腐败的。	For the rest of the world, the unfolding Zhou scandal reconfirms a profoundly worrisome fact: the Middle Kingdom remains deeply corrupt.
但国会僵局的回归可能切断这一趋势，给人们的预期浇下一盆冷水，而对增长起抑制作用的长期趋势（如人口等）也不会消失。	But the return of gridlock in Congress could short-circuit this trend and put a damper on expectations, while growth-constraining secular trends like demographics are not just going to disappear.
在南非，特赦是“真相和妥协”过程的关键要素。 而这一过程又是南非从四十多年白人少数统治转向民主的关键。	In South Africa, amnesty was a key feature of the “truth and reconciliation” process that facilitated the peaceful transition from more than four decades of white-minority rule to democracy.
科学家可以通过对撞实验寻找那些能够产生暗物质的粒子：一些长期以来就存在，然而同普通物质和光只有微弱的相互作用的粒子。	So experimenters will be looking for new particles with the right properties to provide the astronomical dark matter: very long-lived and very feebly interacting with ordinary matter or light.
目前，各领域的公共服务的供给 — — 包括卫生、教育、暴力、基础设施、交通和物流以及水资源管理 — — 都非常低效。	As it stands, the provision of public services in a wide range of areas – including health, education, violence, infrastructure, transportation and logistics, and the management of water resources – is highly inefficient.
促进多样性 — — 不仅是性别多样性，在许多国家还包括年龄和种族多样性 — — 既事关效率，也事关社会公正。	Promoting diversity – not only in terms of gender, but also with respect to age and, in many countries, ethnic background – is a matter of effectiveness as much as a question of social justice.
在罗马尼亚的大多数新闻记者和政治批评家看来，这种自我标榜的大马士革式的转变无外乎是一个拥有超群的戏剧才能的人所上演的另一出闹剧罢了。	For most journalists and political pundits in Romania, this self-proclaimed Damascene conversion looks like just another political farce from someone with unrivaled histrionic gifts.
这是因为，中国经济正处在一个波澜壮阔的结构转变过程中 — — 制造业领衔的生产国模式将让位给日益强大的服务业推动的消费国模式。	That is because the Chinese economy is in the midst of an extraordinary structural transformation – with a manufacturing-led producer model giving way to an increasingly powerful services-led consumer model.
在债务对GDP比率超过了120%的情况下，意大利缺乏足够的灵活性去实施可以实现从转型向更高速增长过渡的财政刺激政策。	With a debt/GDP ratio of more than 120%, Italy lacks the flexibility to implement fiscal stimulus to bridge the transition to higher growth.
美国打击伊斯兰国的重要盟友库尔德人同样希望改变中东地区的版图，虽然他们的目的与土耳其肯定是不一致的。	The Kurds – key US allies in the fight against ISIS – also want changes to the Middle Eastern map, though certainly not in the same way as Turkey.
由于缺乏专门的公司提供消毒服务，医疗器械行业被禁止生产心脏瓣膜等高利润产品，于是政府用奖励政策来吸引这类企业。	When the medical-device industry was blocked from producing lucrative products like heart valves, owing to the lack of specialized firms to provide sterilization services, the government used incentives to attract such companies.
克林顿和布莱尔的天才之处是将关于社会地位低下群体的真正担忧与不得体地卑躬屈膝于华尔街、伦敦金融城和其他更加见不得人之处的权势人物相结合。	The genius of Clinton and Blair was to combine genuine concern for the underprivileged with an unseemly devotion to the fat cats of Wall Street, the City of London, and some murkier places, too.
发自纽波特滩 — — 面对政治局面动荡和街头抗议频发，埃及的政治精英们（不管是执政还是在野党）的稳妥做法应是关注当前动荡的经济含义。	NEWPORT BEACH – Facing a turbulent political situation and recurrent street protests, Egypt’s political elite would be well advised to focus on the economic implications of the current turmoil, whether they are in government or in opposition.
如今欧盟预算拨出更多资金用于核能而非核能以外能源的研究和开发，还有更多基础设施投资用于传统能源及碳的捕获和储存（CCS）而非可再生能源的发展应用。	More money from the EU budget now goes to nuclear research than to non-nuclear research and development, and more infrastructure funding goes to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and conventional energy than to renewable energies.
很大一部分企业利润目前按照个人所得征税，这一事实意味着很难将公司税改革和个税改革分开，而奥巴马和国会正是希望这样做。	The fact that a large share of business income is currently taxed as personal income makes it difficult to separate corporate tax reform from personal tax reform, as Obama and members of Congress would prefer to do.
今年初，麦克瑞维奇解雇了90%的军队参谋人员以及82%的军队指挥人员，组建了一支由亲克里姆林分子和北约批评人士组成的新的军事力量。	And earlier this year, Macierewicz fired 90% of the military’s General Staff and 82% of its General Command, and formed a new military force whose leadership consists of pro-Kremlin activists and NATO critics.
显然，减少产妇和新生儿死亡率和发病率方面的进步需要改善和强化提供分娩服务的初级医疗场所的能力和看护质量。	Progress on reducing maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, it has become clear, requires improving and strengthening the capabilities and quality of care in primary care facilities that provide labor and delivery services.
大多数接过传单的人都不知道自己吃的鸡蛋原来来自于那些极为窄小，以致连一只鸟都无法完全伸展双翼的笼子 — — 而常规操作中这么一个笼子要装下四只母鸡。	Most of those who took the leaflets did not know that their eggs came from hens kept in cages so small that even one bird – the cages normally housed four – would be unable to fully stretch and flap her wings.
迎合民粹主义也许具有短期选举利益的吸引力，但需要付出信誉的长期代价，这一带价不管是对他们本身还是对欧盟都是十分高昂的。	Pandering to populists may be attractive in terms of short-term electoral gains, but the long-term cost in terms of credibility, both their own and that of the EU, will be very high.
比如，在肯尼亚，接受太阳能电板安装技能的马加迪（Magadi）的马赛（Maasai）女性在不到两年时间内为2,000 户家庭带来了电力。	In Kenya, for example, Maasai women in Magadi who have been trained to install solar power have brought electricity to 2,000 households in just two years.
由南非发起和主办的年联合国气候变化会议形成了一个协议 — — 尽快实施全球气候变化法律协议，最晚不能超过今年。	The UN Climate Change Conference in 2011 – initiated and hosted by South Africa – produced an agreement to adopt a universal legal agreement on climate change as soon as possible, no later than this year.
我只是担忧奥巴马可能会感到厌倦：假如我们把政府治理看作一场总统大选，那么就意味着一周7天，一天24小时奥巴马都处于激烈辩论之中，这样你估计自己能坚持多久？	I just worry about the boredom factor. If you assume that governing is like campaigning – that you have to be on top of the debate 24 hours a day, seven days a week – can you really anticipate a long shelf life?
伊斯兰堡—穆斯林政府可以将自己从本国权势军方手中解放出来，建立可以与自由民主国家相提并论的文官执政吗？	ISLAMABAD – Can Muslim governments free themselves from their countries’ powerful militaries and establish civilian control comparable to that found in liberal democracies?
用里根经济顾问委员会成员比尔·尼斯卡宁（Bill Niskanen）的话说 ， “ 里根政府所推出的贸易新限制比胡佛以来的任何一届政府都要多 。 ”	To quote Bill Niskanen, a member of Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers, “the administration imposed more new restraints on trade than any administration since Herbert Hoover.”
萨默斯是对的，一所大学不应该“把一个恶意搅局者的否决权授予那些希望以自己的直觉而不是自身论据的力量来度过一天的人 ” 。	Summers is right that a university is no place for “giving a heckler’s veto to those who want to carry the day with the strength of their feeling rather than the force of their argument.”
比如，中国军事规划者发展出一种“超限战”战略，利用电子、外交、网络、恐怖主义代理、经济和宣传工具欺骗和疲惫美国的系统。	In China, for example, military planners developed a strategy of “unrestricted warfare” that combines electronic, diplomatic, cyber, terrorist-proxy, economic, and propaganda tools to deceive and exhaust US systems.
新的SDG制定了一个崇高的目标（goal ） ： 历史上第一次，世界领导人承诺要减少因癌症、心脏病和糖尿病等慢性疾病所引起的过早死亡。	The new SDGs set a lofty goal: for the first time, world leaders have vowed to reduce premature deaths caused by chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
大量美国顶级企业家、公司高管和研究人员从国防部获得支持，因此毫不奇怪 ， （ 比如）谷歌创始人和高管与国安局官员十分友好地通信往来。	With so many of America’s top entrepreneurs, executives, and researchers having received support from the defense department, it is no surprise that Google’s founders and executives, for example, have exchanged friendly emails with NSA officials.
在1980年代，时任美国总统的罗纳德·里根（Ronald Reagan）发起了一场与苏联之间的军事开支竞赛，并最终以影响许多国家的方式改变了全球势力对比。	In the 1980s, US President Ronald Reagan initiated a military spending race with the Soviet Union that ended up altering the global balance of power in ways that affected many countries worldwide.
过渡期将在2019年3月 — — 英国退欧过程的官方期限 — — 后继续维持至少两年，也就是说，在2021年之前，英国都将是实质上的欧盟成员国，但没有任何投票权。	This period would last for at least two years after March 2019 – the official deadline for the Brexit process – meaning that until 2021, Britain would essentially be an EU member state without any voting rights.
这是一个漫长的艰难过程，但德国社会铭记着它的历史错误，因此如今有能力面对大量难民涌入所带来的道德和政治挑战。	This was a long, difficult process; but German society, mindful of its historical misdeeds, has become capable of confronting moral and political challenges of the type posed by the influx of refugees today.
相反，足够多的选民开始理解，在这个愤怒中 — — 在其发言人及其表达愤怒的用词中 — — 隐含着对共和，对民主，对民族基本价值的威胁。	On the contrary, a sufficient number of voters came to understand that in that very anger – in its spokespeople and in the words used to express it – lurked a threat to the republic, to democracy, and to the nation’s fundamental values.
但利比亚人可能已经受够了四十年的军事独裁统治，他们中的绝大多数从来没有从国家财富或经济发展潜力中得到任何好处。	But four decades of military-based dictatorship may be enough for Libyans, a majority of whom never really benefited from their country’s wealth or potential.
比方说，他们正在讨论INDC到2030年合计完成减排25%还是30 % ， 而此后我们需要25 % 、 30%还是40%的减排才能完成目标。	They are debating, for example, whether the INDCs add up to a 25% or 30% reduction by 2030, and whether we need a 25%, 30%, or 40% reduction by then to be on track.
墨西哥在经历了几十年的一党执政后，如今已是强大的民��国家，经历了多轮通过选票箱实现的政治领导层更迭。	Mexico, for decades a one-party state, is now a robust democracy that has experienced several rotations of political leadership through the ballot box.
就连欧洲央行也估计，2017年欧元区失业率仍将高达9.9 % — —远高于七年前全球金融危机爆发前的平均水平。	Even the ECB estimates that the eurozone unemployment rate will still be 9.9% in 2017 – well above the 7.2% average prior to the global financial crisis seven years ago.
看着那位走极端伊斯兰主义路线的伊朗总统一面声称自己敞开怀抱修复美伊关系，一面又仿佛因此而受到一位据说相当务实的最高领袖的迫害，实在是够讽刺的。	It is ironic to see Iran’s radical Islamist president portray himself as open to resuming US-Iran relations and suffer for it at the hands of a supposedly pragmatic Supreme Leader.
欧盟外交和安全政策高级代表莫盖里尼（Federica Mogherini）说，欧盟正在考虑采取更多措施，包括进一步缩减贸易和金融交易。	According to Federica Mogherini, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the EU is considering additional measures, including further reductions in trade and financial exchanges.
根据我们的研究，如果未来的能源供给和需求，以及森林和土地储存碳元素的方式，能够遵循一定的方法，就能大大降低变暖的速度。	According to our analysis, there are pathways for the future supply and demand of energy, and for how forests and land store carbon, that, if followed, will dramatically slow the pace of warming.
在随后的讨论中，一些FOMC成员认为通胀率应该调低至2%以下，但没有人认为如果通胀比这更低（但仍然为正）的话应该让通胀增加一点。	During the ensuing discussion, several FOMC members argued that the inflation rate might be reduced to less than 2%, but nobody argued that inflation should be pushed higher if a lower, but still positive, rate was achieved.

如今，美国市场上充斥着廉价的国产天然气，其中一部分LNG出口至欧洲，给俄罗斯和挪威等传统出口国带来了意料之外的竞争。	Now, with the US market cordoned off by cheap domestic gas, some of that LNG is going to Europe, introducing unexpected competition for traditional suppliers Russia and Norway.
他提出了新的法律，要求Google和Facebook等在线实体为其用户在线发布的任何“仇恨言论”负责。	"He has proposed new laws that would make online entities like Google and Facebook responsible for any ""hate speech"" posted online by their users."
21世纪初和现在，美联储都更倾向于缓慢正常化，这导致在紧急状况过去很久之后，货币政策仍保持在紧急状态。	The Fed’s preference for glacial normalization both in the early 2000s and now keeps monetary policy on emergency settings long after the emergency has passed.
德国是唯一一个例外，但在地缘战略问题上还算不上重量级角色；虽然日本最了解核战争的恐怖，但国内依然有重要势力呼吁改变其无核态度。	Germany is an exception, though hardly a geostrategic heavyweight; and though Japan knows the horror of nuclear war, important domestic voices there are calling for a change of its non-nuclear status.
而且可能不会有太多警告，因为气候影响通常不会以线性方式逐渐演变，而是突然剧烈出现，一旦我们实现对某个临界点的突破。	And we may not get much warning, because climate effects generally do not evolve in a linear fashion, but rather emerge suddenly and powerfully, once certain tipping points have been reached.
但另一种意见 - - 主要是来自富裕国家 - - 认为，如今的家庭都只有很少的孩子，将来都不够照顾年老的父母。	The other side of the debate, mainly in rich countries, argues that households are now having so few children that there won't be enough to care for aging parents.
巴黎 — — 从法国政府面对大规模抗议活动取消其原计划大幅上调燃油税的那一刻起，显而易见，人们对此次运动的看法将会是不充分、不足道，而且最重要的是，无法带来任何安抚情绪的效果。	PARIS – From the moment the French government canceled its planned fuel tax hike in the face of massive protests, it was obvious that the move would be perceived as inadequate, insignificant, and above all incapable of having any calming effect.
但事实是我们是真正的僧侣，并且数千名来自仰光、曼德勒、白古、阿拉干、马圭和实皆为了和平而参加游行示威的人都是真正的僧侣。	But we are genuine, and thousands of us – from Rangoon, Mandalay, Pegu, Arakan, Magwe, and Sagaing – demonstrated for peace.
你可以想象一下要求康德学派给绝对命令（categorical imperative）添加一点功利主义。	Imagine asking a Kantian to add just a bit of utilitarian calculation to the categorical imperative.
多伦多 — 2002年，来自普林斯顿大学的认知科学家丹尼尔·卡纳曼获得了该年度的诺贝尔经济学奖，表彰他和长期合作者阿莫斯·特沃斯基（已经于1996年过世）所作的贡献。	TORONTO – In 2002, the cognitive scientist Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University won the Nobel Prize in Economics for work done with his longtime collaborator Amos Tversky (who died in 1996).
但是，在纸币时代，币值与某种贵金属（事实上，可以是任何一种商品）的实体存量之间的联系已不复存在，因此，没有任何理由要求央行放弃总体通胀率目标。	In an era of paper money, however, the link to a physical stock of some precious metal – or, indeed, some other commodity – does not exist, and there should be no reason why a central bank cannot aim at an overall inflation rate.
当然，拥有并非意味着使用，过去15年来世界有了8个核子国家，而自从1945年以来还从来没有使用过核武器。	It is true that possessing does not mean using; that for 15 years the world has had eight nuclear powers; and that nuclear force has not been used since 1945.
欧盟十年前就已经禁止这样的行为，但其政策没有在全球范围得到推广，因为主要粮食生产国的利益集团挡在了路前。	The European Union has prohibited this practice for a decade now, but its policy has not spread globally because vested interests in major food-producing countries have stood in the way.
乌克兰也一样，2004~2007年间的大泡沫之后就是2009年相当于GDP总额15%的收缩 — — 也是其国内政策所导致的直接后果。	In Ukraine, too, a huge boom in 2004-2007 was followed by a contraction amounting to almost 15% GDP in 2009 – a direct result of domestic policies.
正如伊拉克政治学家加桑·阿提亚（ Ghassan Atiyyah ）所言，连一个地区盟友也没有的库尔德人都能在伊拉克闹了 80 年。	As the Iraqi political scientist Ghassan Atiyyah, has noted, the Kurds, even without regional allies, have been able to de-stabilize Iraq for 80 years.
更晚近一些，2001年政府和产业界合力将个人基因组测序成本从2001年的大约1亿美元下降到今天的区区1,000美元。	More recently, government and industry got together to cut the costs of sequencing an individual genome from around $100 million in 2001 to just $1,000 today.
类似地，在尼加拉瓜 — — 与厄瓜多尔一样，尼加拉瓜也在委内瑞拉的影响力圈之内 — — 最高法院裁决总统奥尔特加可以再次连任，尽管许多法律学者对此并不认同。	Similarly, in Nicaragua – like Ecuador, also in Venezuela’s sphere of influence – the Supreme Court decided that President Daniel Ortega can run again, even though many legal scholars believe otherwise.
1957年，当种族隔离政策在美国法律中根深蒂固的时候，加纳的第一位总统克瓦米·恩克鲁玛利用本国从英国独立的机缘呼吁人们关注美国黑人每天都在经历的不平等现象。	In 1957, when legal segregation seemed entrenched in the US, Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, used the occasion of his country’s independence from Britain to highlight the injustices experienced daily by black Americans.
从这个意义上讲，即将投入运营的伊朗阿拉克核电厂（允许伊朗在国内生产钚元素并实现其武器化）或许是临时协议最令人不安的项目。	In this sense, perhaps the most troubling aspect of the interim deal concerns Iran’s yet-to-be-opened Arak plant, which would offer a path to domestic plutonium production and weaponization.
事实上，就在谈话最终失败之前，包括捷克共和国和斯洛伐克在内的五个新成员国，甚至同意了一项更过分的计划，在这项计划中，预算之占欧盟GDP的1 % 。	Indeed, just before the ultimate collapse of the talks, five new members, including the Czech Republic and Slovakia, agreed to an even more radical plan, under which the budget would be only 1% of the EU’s GDP.
因此，中国行政改革的真正考验是当局能否通过改进破产制度和阻止欺诈及市场操纵的监管，让市场力量能够真正主导资源配置。	That is why the real test of China’s administrative reforms is whether, through improved bankruptcy mechanisms and regulations that block fraud and market manipulation, they allow – and even facilitate – the effective functioning of market forces.
他们自认为是西方文化统治的反抗力量，并且面对他们所认为的例如世俗主义和人权等帝国主义化观念时伸张他们的宗教身份特征。	They view themselves as counter-forces to cultural domination by the West, asserting their religious identity in the face of what they regard as imperializing ideas like secularism and human rights.
摩尔说，这些死亡都是可以预防的，只要使用“黄金大米”即可。 黄金大米是一种转基因水稻，含有高量贝塔胡萝卜素。	These deaths could be prevented, Moore claims, by the use of “golden rice,” a form of the grain that has been genetically modified to have a higher beta carotene content than ordinary rice.
以麦肯锡全球研究所（McKinsey Global Institute）的最新报告《数字美国 》 （ Digital America）所提供的数字为例。	Consider some of the figures provided by the McKinsey Global Institute’s recent report Digital America.

我承认，我们对世界其他国家存在巨大的贸易赤字（大约每年8,000亿美元，或美国GDP的4 % ） ，而对华贸易大约占了一半（约4,000亿美元 ） 。	I acknowledge that we have an enormous trade deficit with the rest of the world (about $800 billion this year, or 4% of US GDP) and that our trade deficit with China is about half of that total (about $400 billion).
20世纪70年代，普通意大利工薪阶层家庭对子女最大的希望是让他们学习，取得大学学位，然后成为医生或者律师。	In the 1970’s, the average Italian working-class family’s major ambition for its children was for them to study, go to university, and become a doctor or a lawyer.
美国退休制度的另一大支柱 — — 个人退休储蓄对大部分家庭来说是远远不够的，这部分是因为中位收入已有数十年停滞不前，导致储蓄变得困难。	Personal retirement savings, another pillar of the US retirement system, are woefully inadequate for most households, partly because the decades-long stagnation in median wages has made it difficult to save.
拉古娜海滩—在最近的英国之行中，我十分震惊地发现，关于英国是否应该留在欧盟的问题绝对主宰着媒体、董事会讨论和晚餐谈话。	LAGUNA BEACH – During a recent visit to the United Kingdom, I was struck by the extent to which the question of whether the country should remain in the European Union is dominating the media, boardroom discussions, and dinner conversations.
此外，欧元区国家正在受到石油价格下降和中国增长放缓的影响 — — 而欧洲央行的低利率对这两个因素没有什么效果。	Moreover, eurozone countries are feeling the effects of falling oil prices and slower Chinese growth – two factors on which the ECB’s low interest rates have little bearing.
此前，胡主席已数次到过华盛顿进行“工作访问 ” ， 但此次访问是他成为中国国家主席8年来首次正式“国事访问 ” 。	Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi was sent to Washington last week to apply the final touches to the preparations.
另一方面，当一个人扶摇直上，其他人也随之鸡犬升天，正如薄熙来大权在握的时候其妻子以及许多亲戚都生意兴隆那样。	On the other hand, when he is riding high, they benefit, as was the case with many of Bo’s relatives and his wife, whose businesses thrived while he was in power.
考虑到国有企业债务问题的严重性 — — 光是中国铁路总公司就存在3万亿人民币债务 — — 当国有企业债务转手到民营资产管理公司时，免不了要有些折价。	Given the severity of SOEs’ debt problem – the National Railway Company alone holds CN¥3 trillion (over $40 billion) in debt – discounts are inevitable when SOE debts are transferred to private AMCs.
但我们看到的是其成员国越来越多地通过本国的视角来考虑问题，从而破坏了寻求全欧洲级别的解决方案的可能性（难民危机就是一个悲剧性的经典范例 ） 。	But what we are seeing is its member states increasingly adopting a national approach, thus undermining the possibility of Europe-wide solutions (the migration crisis is a tragic case in point).
法定项目占GDP之比在1996年时只有4.5 % ， 如今占13.3 % ， 预计到2026年将占15 % 。	The mandatory programs’ share of GDP, only 4.5% in 1966, is now 13.3% and projected to reach 15% in 2026.
其次，我们在中期目标的指导下保持着稳定的货币政策，避免了对若干指数变化做出过于简单的判断和机械的反应。	Second, we kept a steady hand, guided by our medium-term orientation, while eschewing oversimplified diagnostics and mechanistic reactions to a few indicators.
十年以来人们一直在为2008~2018年的灾难寻找一线希望，希望这一时期能够将金融，行为经济学和宏观经济学更富有成效地整合在一起。	For a decade now, people have been looking for a silver lining to the disasters of 2008-2018, hoping that this period will bring about a more productive integration of finance, behavioral economics, and macroeconomic orthodoxy.
在这种困境中催生出一种流行理念：债券市场实际上欢迎更少的财政紧缩，因为这样才能促进经济增长，从而使公共债务水平在长期上显得更可持续。	From this predicament stems the fashionable idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal austerity, because this would boost economic growth, in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run.
选战期间，特朗普经常用替罪羊 — — 特别是移民和中国和墨西哥等主要发展中出口国 — — 来吸引支持。	During the campaign, Trump often used scapegoats – especially immigrants and major developing-world exporters, such as China and Mexico – to attract support.
如今这一幕有了现实政治版，俄罗斯总理普京最近愉快地将教皇方济各视为共同反对美国军事干预叙利亚的盟友。	In an updated lesson in realpolitik, Russian President Vladimir Putin recently was happy to count Pope Francis as an ally in opposing American military intervention in Syria.
纵观大量的最新研究成果 — — 来源于广泛的利益相关方分析，而选定的实施地首先是安得拉邦和拉贾斯坦邦 — — 显示出除农业补贴外，还有更多方式为最贫困农民提供帮助。	Looking across the entire volume of new research – informed by extensive stakeholder analysis, and undertaken first for the states of Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan – shows even more ways to help the poorest that go far beyond farmer assistance.
教皇本笃十六世访问中东的焦点是耶路撒冷对基督徒、穆斯林和犹太人的重要性。 所以将圣城犹太化的企图必须立即停止。	The focus of Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to the Middle East was Jerusalem’s importance to Christians, Muslims, and Jews, so that attempts to Judaize the Holy City must stop immediately.
印度必须从维穆拉之死中认识到投身于甘地的理想的重要性，惟其如此，聪明的达利特学生才不会被推向绝望甚至更糟糕。	The country must see in the Vemula tragedy a reminder of the vital need to rededicate ourselves to Gandhi’s ideals, so that bright Dalit students are not driven to despair – or worse.
桑德斯阵营提出的核心方案是将华尔街大银行分解成小机构，从而确保任何银行都不会过于庞大以至于其倒闭会危及金融体系的其他部分。	At the center of Sanders’s campaign is a proposal to break up the big Wall Street banks into little pieces, thereby ensuring that no bank is so big that its failure would endanger the rest of the financial system.
但是，尽管他在1987年无限接近和平协议，但在与侯赛因国王签订伦敦协定（London Agreement）时，协定最终胎死腹中。	But, though he came tantalizingly close to a peace deal in 1987, when he signed the London Agreement with King Hussein, the agreement was stillborn.
地方政府纷纷通过人为压低价格向投资者出售土地以获得发展资金，这就刺激了大量投资流入房地产开发，导致房地产价格以不可持续的高速度增长。	And local governments’ effort to finance development by selling land to investors at artificially low prices has spurred massive investment in real-estate development, causing property prices to rise at unsustainably high rates.
但是，在中间的棋盘上，世界经济实力已经多极化了，其中，美国、欧洲、日本和中国是主要的参与者，而其他国家的重要性正在增加。	But on the middle chessboard, economic power is already multi-polar, with the US, Europe, Japan and China as the major players, and others gaining in importance.
他的预测只不过是两大趋势的外推：全球范围的持续金融深化（即金融资产增长快于实体经济）以及伦敦保持在全球金融业务中的份额。	His forecast represented a simple extrapolation of two trends: continued financial deepening worldwide (that is, faster growth of financial assets than of the real economy), and London’s maintenance of its share of the global financial business.
实际上 ， “ 现实”商业周期经济学家们通常认为，如果不是因为罗斯福新政失策，1929年到1932年之间经济大萧条的复苏本可以早点到来。	Indeed, “real” business-cycle economists typically argue that, but for Roosevelt’s misguided New Deal policies, recovery from the Great Depression of 1929-1933 would have been much faster than it was.
无论是在贝鲁特数字区还是开罗的GrEEk产业园，中东最聪明的头脑正在将创新理念转化为可以销售的产品。	Whether it’s in the Beirut Digital District or the GrEEK campus in Cairo, some of the Middle East’s brightest minds are turning innovative ideas into marketable products.
但是缅甸的表现令人大失所望，东盟也是如此，尽管它们在拖了很久后终于开始投入救援，期望能在恶劣的环境下做出最大的努力。	Burma failed miserably, and, despite belated efforts to make the best of terrible circumstances, so has ASEAN.
我们希望为军方领导人开创一条出路，一条与人民的领导人和族群领导人展开真正的对话以及实现民族团结的路子。	We hoped to create a way out for the military leaders, a way to start a real dialogue with the people’s leaders and the leaders of ethnic groups, for the unity of the nation.
刑事审判占据了公众想象力的很大部分，但借用生物学的一个比喻 — — 这只是法律这个复杂殿堂中的一个隔间而已。	Criminal trials fill a large space in the public imagination, but – to borrow a metaphor from biology – they are but one cell of law’s complex corpus.
对于我们所有年轻人和老年人来说，明年和无限远的未来的最大挑战将会来自于不同形式的变化，而这种变化不大可能仅仅应付技术决定论。	The biggest challenge for all of us, young and old, next year and for the indefinite future, will result from a different sort of change that is unlikely to respond simply to technological determinism.
亚洲人清醒地意识到，国际货币基金组织在介入欧元危机时提供了比1997-1998年亚洲金融危机时期更多的支持，因此也顺理成章地认定应该对组织的运作有更多的话语权。	Asians are acutely aware that the IMF has intervened in the euro crisis with much greater support than it provided during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, and they understandably feel entitled to a larger say in how the Fund is run.
可以通过设计一种与授权机制来减少这种危险，不要简单地同意或拒绝，而是提供多种工具供有关国家选择，让它们可以在情况有所变化时在不同品种之间做出调整。	This danger would be attenuated if pre-qualification was not a yes-or-no decision: if there were a range of facilities for which countries could be pre-qualified, they could be moved between them as circumstances changed.
即便不考虑转移支付在大多数国家已经在财政上不可持续的事实（因为该政策早在经济和人口构成尚处于理想状态时就被实施和扩大了 ） ， 它们是否就能提振经济呢？	Leaving aside the fact that transfer payments are already fiscally unsustainable in most countries (because they were adopted and expanded under better economic and demographic conditions), could they lift the economy?
比如，孤弱社会党赢得215席而EPP赢得185席，那么这一重大差距将使其领导人马丁·舒尔茨成为有力竞争者，即便没有一个政党接近于376席的绝对多数。	If, for example, the Socialists won 215 seats, compared to 185 for the EPP, the substantial difference would make their leader, Martin Schultz, a very strong contender, even though no party came close to an absolute majority of 376 seats.
大部分（甚至所有）欧元区国家和准欧元区国家的参与能增强欧元区的凝聚力，更容易获得其他领域合作的公众支持。	The involvement of most, or all, current and future eurozone countries would enhance the group’s coherence, making it easier to win public support for cooperation in other areas.
但是食品不应当被看成仅仅是另一种商品，而各国政府应该制定恰当的政策、建造基础设施以及建立恰当的体制以确保在国家和地区层面的食品安全（这并不等同于完全自给自足 ） 。	But food cannot be treated as just another commodity, and governments should develop appropriate policies, infrastructure, and institutions to ensure food security (not to be equated with total self-sufficiency) at the national or regional level.
正如家庭范围之外的女性 — — 在公共场合抛头露面、与男性一起工作和生活者 — — 被视为危险的勾引者，爱男人的男性通常会被视为袭击者，时刻紧盯着社会中的儿童。	Just as women outside the family home – women who stake a claim to public space, working and living among men – are seen as dangerous temptresses, men who love men are often regarded as predators, ready to pounce on society’s children.
所谓的东盟道路 — — 特点是以共识为基础的决策和不干涉政策 — — 为东盟带来了极大的好处，因此就此放弃也是不明智的。	The so-called ASEAN way, characterized by consensus-based decision-making and non-interference, has served ASEAN well, and the bloc would be unwise to jettison it.
最后，第三种理论显示过往研究中的种族偏执狂能更好地辨别犹太人仅仅是因为他们将更多面孔认定为“犹太人 ” 。	Finally, a third theory suggests that racial bigots in past studies were better at identifying Jewish people simply because they selected “Jewish” for more faces.
但减速的规模令人奇怪，同样令人奇怪的是减速从2008年衰退之前几年就开始了 — — 而且不仅局限于私人保险系统，也出现在两大政府卫生项目 — — 医疗保险（Medicare）和医疗补助（Medicaid）上。	But the size of the slowdown is surprising, as is the fact that it started several years before the 2008 recession – and not only in the private insurance system, but also in Medicare and Medicaid, the two major government health programs.
另一方面，克鲁格曼令人费解地举起了粗犷总需求管理的大旗，将近几年对大规模预算赤字的支持也说成是进步经济学的一部分。	On the other hand, Krugman has inexplicably taken up the mantle of crude aggregate-demand management, making it seem that favoring large budget deficits in recent years is also part of progressive economics.
土耳其政治分析家阿克约尔（Mustafa Akyol）指出，对许多土耳其人来说 ， “ 关注叙利亚并不意味着‘让我们去解放它。	As the Turkish political analyst Mustafa Akyol has put it, for most of the Turkish population, “care for Syria does not translate into, ‘Let’s go liberate it.’”
联合国和布雷顿森林机构再也不能反映世界的权力平衡，而即使各国不得不面对的共同问题越来越多，它们进行主权交流解决问题的意愿却越来越弱。	The United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions no longer reflect the world’s power balance, and, even as the scale of problems common to all countries has increased, their willingness to share sovereignty to tackle them has diminished.
事实上，在过去135年中只出现过两个该指数高于当前点位的年份 — — 1929和2000年，而这可不是什么让人放心的先例。	In fact, the CAPE ratio has been higher than it is today only twice in its 135-plus year history – in 1929 and in 2000. Those are not comforting precedents.
乌干达智库公共政策研究所（Institute of Public Policy Research）将该计划称为“国家批准的人才流失 ” （ state-sanctioned brain drain ） 。	A Ugandan think tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research, has called the plan a “state-sanctioned brain drain.”
在欧洲，政客们都明白重大结构性改革的需要，包括那些需要加强地区一体化的改革；但公私对于这些改革的具体内容无从确知。	In Europe, politicians are aware of the need for major structural reforms, including those required to solidify regional integration; but companies lack adequate clarity about the components of such reforms.
在在线P2P贷款中，个人（以及越来越多的机构）投资者提供资金，这些资金可用于贷款给个人借款人，而不需要传统金融中介的参与。	In online P2P lending, individual (and, lately, institutional) investors provide funds that can be lent out to individual borrowers, without involving a traditional financial intermediary.
尽管大多数耳道假丝酵母菌感染可使用刺白霉素类（echinocandins）抗真菌药物治疗，但其中一些已证实对刺白霉素以及其它两种唑类和多烯类抗真菌药物表现出不同水平的抗药性。	While most C. auris infections are treatable with a class of antifungal drug called echinocandins, some have demonstrated varying levels of resistance to echinocandins, as well as to the other two classes of antifungal drugs, azoles and polyenes.
奥巴马的预算草案认识到，不可能所有目标和预期同时达到，从现在看，增长从某种程度上说是一个分配问题，而从长期看，它是一个代际问题（也是潜在的包容性和社会稳定性问题 ） 。	Obama’s proposed budget recognizes that all objectives and expectations cannot be met, and that growth is partly a distributional issue now and an intergenerational issue (and potentially one of inclusiveness and social stability) in the longer term.
在德国，1990年关于两名精神分裂症患者暴力袭击著名政客的详细报道导致德国公众认为精神病患者是危险的。	In Germany, extensive reports on violent attacks against prominent politicians by two people suffering from schizophrenia in 1990 bolstered the German public’s belief that mentally ill people are dangerous.
阿根廷作家博尔赫斯曾经写过一则短故事 — — 只有一段的短故事 — — 也许能作为科学方法的最佳指导。	Jorge Luis Borges, the Argentine writer, once wrote a short story – a single paragraph – that is perhaps the best guide to the scientific method.
尽管距美国边境仍有1，000英里，但特朗普仍将那些难民描绘成迫在眉睫的国家安全威胁，并在毫无证据的情况下警告，难民队伍中混入了“中东人 ” 。	Though still roughly 1,000 miles from the US border, Trump portrayed the refugees as an imminent national security threat, warning, without evidence, that “Middle Easterners” were among them.
这有助于领袖发展和维持与一大群人的人际关系，尽管他们之间的权力有别，与此同时，也可以让员工更用以地认同组织。	This helps leaders to develop and maintain human bonds with a large group of people, despite the power gap, while making it easier for employees to identify with the organization.
德国企业部门资本比率不断升高，主要原因是税收因素和为了应对2008年全球金融危机和两年后爆发的欧元区危机而构建的风险缓冲。	The German corporate sector is recording increasing capital ratios, mainly owing to tax factors and the creation of risk buffers in response to both the 2008 global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis that erupted two years later.
大银行能够营造这样的安排的原因是一个潜在威胁：如果具系统重要性的银行陷入破产，那么金融部门 — — 以及与之相关的经济支付系统 — — 将会崩溃。	Big banks’ ability to extort such an arrangement stems from an implicit threat: the financial sector – and with it the economy’s payment system – would collapse if a systemically important bank were ever pushed into insolvency.
社会党和中间偏右政党赢得的席位数可能会影响下届欧洲联盟委员会 的组成-因此，也会影响2014年前的欧盟政治议程。	The number of seats won by the socialists and centre-right parties is likely to influence the make-up of the next European Commission – and thus the EU’s political agenda until 2014.
中国人民银行应当维持商业银行的资本储备要求以限制信贷创造，而不是像2008年前的发达经济体那样将其视为过时的东西。	The People’s Bank of China should maintain reserve requirements for commercial banks to contain credit creation, rather than reject them as old-fashioned, as occurred in the advanced economies in the decades before 2008.
实际上，阿巴·埃班曾嘲笑贝京“把以色列当作被解除武装的哥斯达黎加，而把巴勒斯坦解放组织看成拿破仑·波拿巴、亚历山大大帝和匈奴王阿提拉的联合体 。 ”	Indeed, Abba Eban ridiculed Begin for behaving “as if Israel were a kind of disarmed Costa Rica and the PLO was Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, and Attila the Hun all wrapped into one.”
好消息是，虽然依旧将紧缩言论挂在嘴边，但七国集团（G7）的各先进经济体似乎准备开始 — — 或者已经开始 — — ��多地依靠财政政策来支持下滑的经济增长。	The good news is that the advanced economies of the G7 seem poised to begin – or perhaps have already begun – to rely more on fiscal policy to bolster sagging economic growth, even as they maintain the rhetoric of austerity.
如果欧元 — — 甚至欧盟本身 — — 想要同时保持存续和民主，其政策制定者们就必须更加密切着眼于将决策委托给非民选机构的苛刻条件。	If the euro – and indeed the EU itself – is to remain viable and democratic at the same time, policymakers will have to pay closer attention to the demanding requirements of delegating decisions to unelected bodies.
你很难看见政治家们如何能先一步解决问题，更别提德国试图限制自己援助出资额的（即使负面但却可以理解的）做法了。	Even setting aside Germany’s understandable attempt to limit how much it would have to pay, it is difficult to see how politicians could have gotten ahead of the problem.
但这些评论家也忽略了他在帮助对抗那十年的主权债务危机，并坚持主张美国开始发行通货膨胀指数债券中所立下的汗马功劳。	But these critics overlook his role in helping to fight that decade’s sovereign-debt crises, and his insistence that the US begin issuing inflation-indexed bonds.
约有50%的中国出口商品之前曾在其他经济体中进行加工，近60%的产品都是由所谓“外资企业”的中国子公司送出国外的。	About 50% of all exports leaving China have been processed previously by other economies, and close to 60% are shipped by Chinese subsidiaries of “foreign-invested enterprises.”
随着信息技术进步、人口结构转换，人民期望上升以及冷战理念的逐渐淡化，世界上那些看似无法撼动的政权纷纷摇摇欲坠。	Entrenched incumbent regimes everywhere are under severe stress from advances in information technology, shifts in demographics, rising expectations, and the obsolescence of Cold War exigencies.
但其总统库马拉通加和总理维克勒马哈辛之间激烈的权力斗争和泰米尔猛虎组织间的派系分裂又使该国处于战火重燃的边缘。	But a bitter power struggle between Sri Lanka's President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and a schism among the rebel Tamil tigers, now threatens to reignite the violence.
德国、荷兰和芬兰的工作者人均分别有15000、17000和21000欧元储蓄由可交易投资变成了一视同仁的欧洲央行债权。	Already German, Dutch, and Finish savings amounting to €15,000, €17,000, and €21,000, respectively, per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB.
最初几轮协商已经释放出明确的信号：加拿大、墨西哥和美国所需要解决的分歧从根本上说在于政治，而不在于经济，并且各自国内的分歧不亚于彼此之间的分歧。	The initial talks are already sending a clear message: the disagreements to be resolved by Canada, Mexico, and the United States are fundamentally political, not economic, and they are as pronounced within each country as they are between them.
新加坡—亚洲正站在历史的黄金机会点，三个人口最多的国家 — — 中国、印度和印度尼西亚都由强大且有活力的改革派领导人领导。	SINGAPORE – Asia is poised to enter a historical sweet spot, with three of its most populous countries – China, India, and Indonesia – led by strong, dynamic, and reform-minded leaders.
推进经济增长、实现千禧年发展目标以及与气候变化做斗争均取决于创造一个面向21世纪的新的能源体系，并推广到地球上的每一个人。	Fostering economic growth, realizing the Millennium Development Goals, and combating climate change will all depend on creating a new energy system for the twenty-first century and extending it to every person on the planet.
但FDIC系统性解决方案咨询委员会（Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee，我也是委员之一）最新的一致意见是对这一论断不能妄加信任。	But the consensus view at the most recent meeting of the FDIC’s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee (of which I am a member) was that this claim should not be taken seriously.
从食品安全与农村地区财富状况的角度看，目前，重访共同农业政策的主要手段以引入新的政策方案的需求颇为迫切。	Viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas, there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP’s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced.
1971年，在经历了二十多年的持续快速增长后，日本经济显著地放缓了脚步，此后四十年，年均增长率不到4 % 。	After more than two decades of sustained rapid growth, Japan’s economy slackened considerably in 1971, leading to four decades of annual growth rates averaging less than 4%.
事实上，在消费、国外直接投资、国内股票市场、贸易、旅游、海外留学、军事现代化和国际外交等领域，同样经历了许多小规模的“繁荣 ” 。	Indeed, there have been many smaller “booms” – in consumption, foreign direct investment, domestic stock markets, trade, travel, overseas study, military modernization, and international diplomacy.
去年,泰国南部地区(该地区以穆斯林人口为主)的暴力事件似乎对他信的雄心壮志有所打击，但其领导的泰爱泰党（TRT）在去年二月取得的压倒性胜利又重新鼓起了他争取地区领导人地位的信心。	Violence in Thailand’s predominantly Muslim south seemed to dent his ambitions last year, but his Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party’s landslide victory last February gave his bid for regional leadership a new lease on life.
2015年，对尼日利亚国家石油公司的审计显示这家企业从未将上届政府执政期间约200亿美元的石油收入汇给政府。	In 2015, an audit of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation revealed that about $20 billion in revenue was never remitted to the authorities under the previous administration.
一个多世纪以前，法国地理学家埃莱斯·瑞克斯曾精准预言人们将一直需要“享受城市之美并同时拥有自然所滋养自由的双重可能性 ” 。	More than a century ago, the French geographer Élisée Reclus astutely predicted that people would always need “the dual possibility of gaining access to the delights of the city …and, at the same time, the freedom that is nourished by nature.”
今后十年我们必须让全球排放量达到峰值，之后快速加以削减，并在本世纪下半叶建立起排放和地球自然吸收能力之间的平衡。	We must bring global emissions to a peak in the next decade, drive them down rapidly thereafter, and establish a balance between emissions and the planet’s natural absorptive capacity by the second half of the century.
正如这些领导人所言 ： “ 解决问题，时不我待 。 ” 因此，他们已做出承诺：将不会在四月份塞浦路斯北部举行选举之前暂停谈判，谈判将继续进行。	Finally, Greece and Turkey – the two key regional actors – support the current talks and are willing to be helpful in finding a solution.
这意味着与最受当今食品体系伤害的人群构建团结，并在借助越来越多的营养失调和营养不良者的共同愤怒去集体组织起来实现真正的变革。	That means cultivating solidarity with those most hurt by today’s food system and using shared outrage at the growing number of malnourished and poorly nourished to organize collectively for genuine change.
如此，JPM自称“坚不可摧”的资产负债表将在一夜之间变得不堪一击，JPM也将陷于猛烈的打击中，远甚于去年。	In that setting, what JPM called its “fortress” balance sheet would suddenly have looked highly vulnerable, and the bank could have found itself under far more damaging attack than it has in the last year.
谁知第二天早晨，物理学家里奥·西拉德（Leo Szilard）就推导出了一个由中子诱导的链式核反应理论；此后不久，他就申请了核反应堆的专利。	The next morning, Leo Szilard hypothesized the idea of a neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction; soon thereafter, he patented the nuclear reactor.
有效的广告宣传，迎合了消费者无意识的冲动 — — 这些冲动通常与食物，性和身份地位有关 — — 推动了消费者购买那些对其自身或社会来说都没有多少价值的产品。	Effective advertising campaigns, appealing to unconscious urges – typically related to food, sex, and status – create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society.
柏林 — — 虽然柏林的泰格尔机场依然迎候着飞抵这个欧洲经济大国的多数旅客，但相关的设施却早已落后而破旧不堪。	BERLIN – Berlin’s Tegel Airport, which still greets most of the passengers arriving in the capital of Europe’s leading economic power, is outdated and provincial.
此外，尽管绝大多数的卫生工作者都是女性，但接受调查的组织中只有43％具备支持妇女从事公共卫生工作的具体措施。	Moreover, only 43% of the organizations that were surveyed have specific measures in place to support women’s careers in public health, despite the overwhelmingly female composition of the health workforce.
他们开始扩大他们的福利制度，将政府支出在GDP中的比例从39%提高至49 % ， 对欧盟提议的双位数的工资增长表示欢迎。	They began to expand their welfare state, pushing the government’s share in GDP from 39% to 49% and welcoming union-proposed double-digit wage increases.
所以，组成和参加一支进驻黎巴嫩南部的国际部队的首要条件是以色列必须重启“路线图”并且坐下来与巴勒斯坦就建立可以存活的国家进行谈判。	So the prior condition for setting up and joining an international force for Southern Lebanon must be that Israel renews its commitment to the “road map” and negotiations with the Palestinians for a viable Palestinian state.
不管怎样，作为一个好斗的新闻调查记者，除了普京之外她还有很多敌人，其中就包括车臣现总理卡德罗夫，她指责他推行的是绑架以换取赎金的策略。	After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
美联储主席伯南克现在极为担忧，除非大幅度降息，否则，美国经济中的房地产市场以及房屋贷款中的问题将会导致经济衰退，即使降息意味着某些通货膨胀的风险。	Fed chairman Ben Bernanke is now extremely concerned that the economy’s housing market and mortgage problems will cause a recession unless interest rates are aggressively cut even if this means taking some risks with inflation.
而高层官僚已经重新开始青睐另一个中世纪名词“陛下的仆人 ” （ lydi gosudarevy ） 。	And another medieval term – lydi gosudarevy, which translates to “servants of his majesty” – has returned to favor among high-ranking bureaucrats.
前美国贸易代表、世界银行行长罗伯特·佐利克（Robert Zoellick）指出，如果崛起的中国为提供全球公共品做出贡献，美国就应该欢迎中国成为“负责任的相关利益者 ” 。	As Robert Zoellick, a former US Trade Representative and World Bank president, has argued, if a rising China contributes to the provision of global public goods, the US should encourage the Chinese to become a “responsible stakeholder.”
奥巴马需要兑现他的承诺，这样才能在设置外交政策新方向的同时设法应付好小布什留给他的问题，即使在今天，这些遗留问题稍有不慎就会给他带来总统连任危机。	Obama needed to meet his promise to set a new direction in foreign policy while simultaneously managing to juggle the issues left to him by George W. Bush, any of which, if dropped, could still cause a crisis for his presidency.
讽刺的是，责任仍在于美联储要“做对的事 ” — —即对利率正常化慎之又慎，同时让劳动力所得占GDP之比上升，即使这要求一定程度的通胀超调。	The onus, ironically, will remain on the Fed to “do the right thing” – namely, to normalize interest rates with extreme caution, while allowing the share of labor income in GDP to rise, even if that requires some overshooting of inflation.
实现这一点这意味着要解决重要的协调问题，因为一个城市的新产业将难以找到具备行业经验的工人或专业供应商。	Achieving this implies solving important coordination problems, because an industry that is new to a city will not find workers with industry experience or specialized suppliers.
前三军情报局(ISI)首脑Hamid Gul中将承认曾组织过一个右翼党派联盟来阻止她获得议会的多数席位。	Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, the former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, confirmed that he sponsored an alliance of right-wing political parties to stop her from getting a parliamentary majority.
“我们有地方检察官和联邦检察官，每天他们都会吹毛求疵地把普通公民送上法庭，用他们的话说，这叫以儆效尤。	“There are district attorneys and United States attorneys out there every day squeezing ordinary citizens on sometimes very thin grounds and taking them to trial in order to make an example, as they put it.
问题不在于采用哪一种税率（这能够也应该通过竞争来决定 ） ， 而是协调的目的在于使跨界交易更为便利。	The question is not one of aligning tax rates, which can and should be determined by competition. Rather, the aim of harmonization is to make cross-border trade easier for business.
首先，财政刺激预期可能确实推高了股价，但也导致更高的长期利率，这不利于资本支出和利息敏感部门（如房地产 ） 。	For starters, the anticipation of fiscal stimulus may have pushed stock prices up, but it also led to higher long-term interest rates, which hurts capital spending and interest-sensitive sectors such as real estate.
比如，在美国，中小企业贡献了三分之二的私营部门新增岗位总量，而在中国，中小企业贡献了GDP的60%左右。	For example, in the United States, SMEs account for about two-thirds of all new private-sector jobs, while in China, SMEs account for roughly 60% of GDP.
在2001年9•11事件的五周年纪念日即将到来之际 ， “ 基地 ” （ al-Qaeda）针对美国的新的攻击也在临近。 我们应该借此机会来评估一下美国和国际社会对此的反应。	As the fifth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda approaches, we should take the opportunity to assess the results of the response by the US and the international community.
美国森林局的护林员们准备了一个笼子，放进了一些咸肉，很快就捉住了这头熊，把它运到了30公里外的荒郊野地中。	Forest Service rangers set up a cage and put some bacon inside, soon catching and transporting the bear 30 kilometers into the wilderness.
尽管最不发达国家吸引的投资还不到北南投资总数的3 % ， 但这些投资在其国内生产总值中所占的比例却达到了3%以上，高于发展中国家的平均水平。	Although the least developed countries attract less than 3% of north-south investments, these flows account for more than 3% of their GDP, a level higher than the average for developing countries.
2008年，德国拯救了海波不动产公司（Hypo Real Estate ） ； 2011年，比利时、法国和卢森堡援助了德克夏银行（Dexia Bank ） 。	In 2008, Germany rescued Hypo Real Estate, and in 2011 Belgium, France, and Luxembourg bailed out Dexia Bank.
但祖玛认为，这样的结果并没有实现1981年时任非国大总统奥利佛·坦博所设定的目标，坦博总统曾试图通过“将国家财富归还给全体民众”来实现经济解放。	But, Zuma argues, the outcomes fall short of the goal set in 1981 by the ANC’s then-president, Oliver Tambo, who sought to achieve economic emancipation, through “a return [sic] of the wealth of the country to the people as a whole.”
政治之风的朝向能否改变，为经济自由化重新注入活力，让那些怀念英国首相玛格丽特·撒切尔或美国总统罗纳德·里根的政治家们走上前台，为改革呼风唤雨？	Will the political winds shift to reinvigorate economic liberalization, with politicians reminiscent of Britain’s Margaret Thatcher or the US’s Ronald Reagan coming to the fore, breathing the fire of change?
一些人指出，领先市场缺乏流动性是价格大部震荡的原因；在一个规模很小的市场中，有时需求或供给的微小变化就需要巨大的价格调整幅度才能重塑均衡。	Some have pointed to a lack of liquidity in leading markets as driving the massive price fluctuations; in a thin market, a small change in demand or supply can sometimes require a big shift in prices to restore equilibrium.
而纵观本人的职业生涯，其中一个最有价值的角色莫过于2014年末至2016年9月在时任首相戴维•卡梅伦（David Cameron）政府治下主持了对抗生素耐药性问题的独立审查。	Over the course of my professional life, one of the most rewarding roles that I ever had was between late 2014 and September 2016, when I chaired an independent Review on AMR under the government of then-Prime Minister David Cameron.
核心和外围国的短期和长期债券收益率 — — 以及外围国利差 — — 可能进一步下降，降低公共和私人部门的资本成本。	Shorter- and longer-term bond yields in core and periphery countries – and spreads in the periphery – may decline further, lowering the cost of capital for the public and private sectors.
收复福克兰群岛是一次大胆的军事行动。 福克兰群岛是遥远的英国属地，其人民在被阿根廷侵占后坚定地站在英国一边。	The recovery of this far-flung British dependency, whose citizens were resolutely committed to remaining British subjects after the Argentine invasion, was a daring military act.
但是，与欧元区相比，中国政府纠正错误的努力 — — 最终让利率和股票价值下跌 — — 堪称速度和效率的典范。	Compared to the European Union, however, the Chinese government’s effort to correct its errors – by eventually allowing interest rates and stock values to slide – seems like a paragon of speed and efficiency.
香港是一个光辉的榜样，让世人看到中国人如果拥有千百万其他人视为理所当然的自由的话，能够实现怎样的成就。	Hong Kong is a shining example to the rest of the world about what Chinese men and women can achieve with the sort of freedom that millions of others take for granted.
半个多世纪来支持以色列政治斗士的和平之梦、民族主义狂热和传说中的宗教救赎都已经幻灭，取而代之的是一种实用主义的态度。	The dream of peace, the nationalist fervor, and the purported religious redemption that animated Israel’s political combatants for a half-century are gone, replaced by a resigned pragmatism.
世界能够日益将援助集中于主要环境问题 — — 室内和室外空气污染以及铅和臭氧污染 — — 几乎所有与环境有关的死亡都是由这些问题造成的。	The world can increasingly focus aid on the main environmental problems – indoor and outdoor air pollution, along with lead and ozone pollution – that cause almost all environment-related deaths.
其实，卡梅伦的演讲表明了他应对困境的方法无外乎老调重弹 — — 为在批评者面前换取短暂的和平，不惜付出让自己（和英国）的长期问题变得更为棘手的代价。	In fact, as Cameron’s speech made clear, his solution to his dilemma – to buy himself short-term peace from his critics at the expense of potentially making his (and Britain’s) problems more intractable in the long term – is hardly new.
但这两大流派都在芝加哥学派“理性预期”理论的光芒下黯然失色，后者在过去25年内统治了整个主流经济学界。	Both traditions, though, were eclipsed by the Chicago school of “rational expectations,” which has dominated mainstream economics for the last twenty-five years.
但它对此的应对手段 — — 本质上只是更多的量化宽松 — — 可能只会适得其反，不但加剧了失衡状况，还将导致严重的金融动荡。	But its response – essentially just more quantitative easing – could backfire, exacerbating imbalances and generating serious financial instability.
但是，有一个规则不能破：与HICCup合作的社区必须收集和公布大量经独立审核的数据（当然不包括个人信息 ） 。	There is, however, one unbreakable rule: To work with HICCup, communities must collect and publish a lot of independently vetted data (without personal information, of course).
1996年，在尼日利亚北部爆发大规模脑膜炎时，辉瑞公司在向当地医生提供口服抗生素特洛芬的同时把服用头孢曲松的病人设为“控制组 ” ， 藉此将测试特洛芬与当前最有效药物进行对比。	During a major meningitis epidemic in northern Nigeria in 1996, the drug company Pfizer supplied doctors with the oral antibiotic Trovan, which the firm wanted to test against the most effective known drug, Ceftriaxone, as a “control.”
但希望还是有的：欧盟以罕见的决心发布了书面指导原则，禁止与在约旦河西岸和东耶路撒冷经营的以色列公司合作。	But there is one promising development: the European Union, in an uncharacteristic show of backbone, has issued written guidelines prohibiting cooperation with Israeli companies operating in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
“肯定会有人拿着这份报告说‘看看美国人的所作所为 ’ ” ，费恩斯坦表示 ， “ 他们会利用这份报告来为自己的邪恶行为寻找借口，或者进一步煽动暴力。	“There are those who will seize upon the report and say ‘see what Americans did,’” Feinstein said, “and they will try to use it to justify evil actions or to incite more violence.
惟其如此，文在寅才有望提振经济增长潜力，创造体面的工作岗位，巩固经济基本面，提高对外部下行风险的抵抗力。	Only with such an approach can Moon hope to boost the economy’s growth potential, create decent jobs, reinforce the economy’s fundamentals, and bolster resilience to external downside risks.
政治领导人表现出更多勇气实施不利于一时增长但有利于稳定财政状况的结构性和社会安全改革已经是过去式了。	It is past time for political leaders to show more courage in implementing structural and social-security reforms that may impede growth for a time, but will stabilize their countries’ fiscal position.

如今，普京把耀武扬威作为其主要外交手段 — — 不仅是在乌克兰和波罗的海国家，也包括巴尔干和北海 — — 德国必须站出来领导欧洲的反应。	Now that Putin has made muscle-flexing his main form of diplomacy – not merely in Ukraine and the Baltic states, but also in the Balkans and the North Sea – it has fallen to Germany to shape Europe’s response.
由于希腊新货币难免将出现贬值，再考虑希腊政府不必为其央行债务兜底的事实，一场剥夺其他央行索偿权的违约在所难免。	Given the new currency’s inevitable devaluation, together with the fact that the Greek government does not have to backstop its central bank’s debt, a default depriving the other central banks of their claims would be all but certain.
欧盟的东欧成员国一开始拒绝分担接受120,000难民的义务，但是，它们需要仰仗欧盟较富裕国家的财政转移支付，因此，在经历了与希腊类似的外交施压后，它们也被迫就范。	The EU’s Eastern European members initially resisted taking their share of the 120,000; but, dependent on fiscal transfers from the EU’s wealthier members, they fell into line after diplomatic arm-twisting similar to that administered to Greece.
“怎么回事 ？ ” 一个当地农夫在一年前问我 ， “ 我们这些当地人都想离开这里，你们这些北方的城市人却想买下我们的屋子搬进来住 ？ ”	“How is it,” a local pig farmer asked me a few a years ago, “that we locals all want to get out of here, and you northern European city dwellers want to buy up our old farmhouses and move in?”
根据传统，此次三中全会《决定》没有讨论关于增长和发展的问题，而人们希望政府尽快给出这方面问题的详细方案。	In line with tradition, the Third Plenum’s resolution did not discuss problems concerning growth and development, which one hopes the government will address in greater detail in the near future.

但奥巴马的亚洲之行也敲响了美国的亚洲政策的主要问题：美国的亚洲“重心”有具体的战略内容吗？ 还是仍然是老政策的新瓶装旧酒？	But Obama’s Asian tour also underscores the main question about American policy in the region: Will the United States’ “pivot” to Asia acquire concrete strategic content, or will it remain largely a rhetorical repackaging of old policies?
夏末，西半球农民会将庄家卖给贸易商以供出口，并要求现金支付，贸易商需要从银行中提现满足农民支付要求。	In the late summer, farmers in the Western Hemisphere brought their crops to traders for export, and demanded cash payment, which the traders needed to raise from their banks.

事实上，欧元区的经验表明，尽管一致的财政刺激能在剧烈衰退时制造不同，当刺激不再不可或缺时退出刺激要比无限期地保持刺激更好。	Indeed, the experience of the eurozone suggests that while concerted fiscal stimulus can make a difference during an acute recession, withdrawing that stimulus when it is no longer vital is preferable to maintaining it indefinitely.
那么，如何看待诺贝尔奖获得者蒙代尔1961年的著名预言呢？ 蒙代尔说，国境线和货币边界并不需要大致重合。	What of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell’s famous 1961 conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap?
其中一个就是消除美国推翻萨达姆政权后伊朗在邻国伊拉克所获得的战略优势，因为当时这一举动帮助人口占多数的伊拉克什叶派穆斯林民众夺取了权力。	One consideration is the need to neutralize the strategic advantage that Iran gained from the US overthrow of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq – a development that helped to empower Iraq’s Shia majority.
官方判决称，他们使用“外国的 ” ， 也就是“西方的”的术语，威胁国家统一，挑战国家主权，煽动民众反对国家。	The official verdict states that they threatened national unity, challenged those in authority, and incited public opinion against the state while using “foreign,” that is, Western, terminology.

人们不应该忘记，尽管有他在竞选过程所说的那些话，以及在许多移民中不受欢迎，但是萨科奇本人就是一个移民的儿子，他正是受益于对移民持勇敢地肯定态度的政策。	And no one should forget that, despite his campaign rhetoric and his apparent unpopularity with many immigrants, Sarkozy himself is an immigrant’s son who favors bold affirmative action policies.
主动向监管部门汇报的比率十分低 — — 大约只有1 % — —并且在许多国家中，保持不断的监测处于消极态势。	Spontaneous reporting rates to regulatory agencies are low – approximately 1% – and ongoing monitoring is passive in many countries.
它是一个像它的领导人通常所表明的那样治理良好的保守派政党、寻求公共领域中伊斯兰的平等，还是像它的敌人所害怕的那样是一个披着温和派羊皮的伊斯兰主义狼？	Is it a conservative party of good government that seeks equality for Islam in the public sphere, as its leaders usually suggest, or an Islamist wolf in moderate sheep’s clothing, as its enemies fear?
毕竟，前奥斯曼克里米亚在相当长的一段时间里都是鞑靼人的故乡，而鞑靼人对克里姆林宫怀有深深的历史仇怨，因为斯大林强迫他们迁徙到中亚草原。	After all, the formerly Ottoman Crimea has long been home to the Tatars, who bear a massive historical grudge against the Kremlin, owing to their forced removal by Stalin to the Central Asian steppes.

更糟糕的是，世行主张采取使用者付费和“覆盖成本”的医疗服务，这导致穷国的最贫困人口 — — 最需要服务的人群 — — 根本无法获得赖以救命的医疗服务。	Even worse, the Bank advocated user fees and “cost recovery” for health services, thereby putting life-saving health care beyond the reach of the poorest of the poor – precisely those most in need of it.
到目前为止，阿富汗尚未承认由英国外交官在1893年所划并由印度殖民统治者强加给阿富汗的杜兰德线（Durand Line）为正式的阿巴边界线。	To this day, Afghanistan has not recognized the Durand Line – drawn by a British diplomat in 1893 and imposed on Afghanistan by India’s colonial rulers – as the formal border with Pakistan.

但另一方面将政府与媒体企业相提并论从本质上是一种误导：任何部门承担的责任义务和肩负的期待都比不上政府。	But, on another level, the attempt to rate government alongside business and the media is fundamentally misguided: no sector operates at the scale of responsibility, accountability, and expectation that governments do.
首先，每五年强制重谈一次的日落条款没有通过，各方达成了一个16年的日落条款，以及每六年审议一次协议安排。	First, instead of a sunset clause that would have forced a renegotiation every five years, the parties agreed to a 16-year sunset, with a review of the arrangement every six years.

格鲁乔难题在现实中的第二个体现，则是大多数共产主义国家的国民都很快发现，他们丧失自由的痛苦并没有换来更多的繁荣或者更高的生活水平。	The second application of Groucho’s question was that citizens of most Communist countries soon learned that the loss of freedom that they suffered was not compensated by greater prosperity or a higher quality of life.

特别是，难道单一全球央行和单一世界货币不是比我们的令人困惑、效率低下并且早已过时的国家货币政策和货币“大杂烩”更有意义吗？	In particular, wouldn’t a single global central bank and a world currency make more sense than our confusing, inefficient, and outdated assemblage of national monetary policies and currencies?
在这一方面，知晓普世的道德直觉以便我们可以对它们进行思考是十分重要的。 而且，如果我们作出选择，也可以反其道而行之。	In this respect, it is important for us to be aware of the universal set of moral intuitions so that we can reflect on them and, if we choose, act contrary to them.

事实上，如果上述努力在设计时旨在确保无分性别及贫富人人机会平等，那么必将在促进国家层面社会和谐的同时致使全球经济从中受益。	Indeed, if such efforts are designed specifically to ensure equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender or wealth, they will be a boon to the global economy, while promoting social cohesion at the national level.

中国当局很清楚自己的国家通过与全球经济的深度整合获益良多，也没打算拿自身国内统治合法性基础 — — 经济增长 — — 去冒险。	The Chinese authorities are well aware of how much their country has benefited from becoming deeply integrated into the global economy. And they are not prepared to risk the basis of their domestic legitimacy: economic growth.
所以，现在急需一个新的、长期的、并且在经济层面上可持续的解决方案—一个与最困苦的当地社区直接相关的方案—从而赢得最贫困的农村人口的支持。	So a new, long-term, economically sustainable solution is urgently needed – one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population.
这一现状的典型事例就是延迟批准《里斯本战略 》 ， 建立不完整的欧洲经济和货币联盟，以及在爱尔兰共和国目前实行阻碍政策之后，新《欧盟宪法条约 》 （ 也就是《里斯本条约 》 ） 前途未卜的命运。	Typical examples of this are the stalled Lisbon Strategy, the incomplete Economic and Monetary Union, and now, following the Irish public’s blocking maneuver, the uncertain fate of the new EU Constitutional Treaty (the “Lisbon Treaty”).
在通胀肆虐的20世纪七八十年代，当投资者对通胀风险溢价的要求推高长期借贷成本时，扩大赤字起到了刺激长期利率进一步走高的效果，而赤字降低抑制了长期利率。	In the inflation-plagued 1970s and 1980s, when investors’ demand for inflation-risk premia pushed up long-term borrowing costs, larger deficits tended to boost long-term interest rates further, while smaller deficits reduced them.

但人们一般喜欢阅读和分享与自己相近的观点；如果它能引发强烈的情绪 — — 尤其是愤怒，那当然就更加理想。	People do, however, like to read and share information that aligns with their perspectives; they like it even more if it triggers strong emotions – especially outrage.

可以肯定，特朗普的政策可能带来新风险和新成本，无论是在国内还是国外；但他将无法成功延长化石燃料时代。	To be sure, Trump’s policies might introduce new dangers and costs, domestically and worldwide; but he will not succeed in prolonging the fossil-fuel era.
在中国的例子中，政府希望更多的人参与股市 — — 其手段是提振股价、促进贷款投资 — — 能让公民更容易接受市场改革。	In China’s case, the government hoped that broader stock-market participation – achieved through efforts to bolster equity prices and promote lending for investment – would make citizens more open to pro-market reforms.

试图通过军事手段实施政治解决方案而导致的全盘崩溃极有可能给未来数十年带来灾难性后果，而土耳其将是首当其冲者之一。	A complete collapse, fueled by efforts to impose a political solution by military means, would most likely lead to catastrophic consequences for decades to come, with Turkey among the worst affected.
最后，对家庭来说，较低的商品价格和较低的通货膨胀率会产生与大幅减税一样的效果，并使利率进一步下降，从而稳定经济行为。	Eventually, lower commodity prices and lower inflation will act like a huge tax cut for households, allowing interest rates to fall further and thus stabilize economic activity.
除了公共部门投资不足，还有货币政策 — — 不管货币政策成本收益如何，它促使公司用现金进行股票回购，而实际投资依然萎靡。	Beyond public-sector underinvestment, there is monetary policy, which, whatever its benefits and costs, has shifted corporate use of cash toward stock buy-backs, while real investment has remained subdued.

在设法让FARC加入在古巴举行的秘密谈判之前，桑托斯的地区外交政策改变了该地区的政治形势 — — 从武力恫吓转向了努力合作。	Prior to engaging the FARC in secret talks in Cuba, Santos’s regional diplomacy shifted the region’s politics from saber rattling to the hard work of cooperation.
因此那些没有类似生活经历的人们最容易受到煽动者的影响，更易被恐慌和虚假的承诺所蛊惑 — — 这点可以用民族主义叙事与民粹主义运动的日渐发展壮大来印证。	With the dangers of demagoguery not embedded in their living memories, they are far more vulnerable to fear-mongering and false promises – illustrated in the growing influence of nationalist narratives and populist movements.
历史学家鲁斯·盖伊（Ruth Gay）写过一本名为《在德国人中间寻找安全 》 （ Safe Among the Germans）的重要著作，描写的就是这250,000名幸存者。	“Safe Among the Germans” proclaimed the title of an important book by the historian Ruth Gay about these 250,000 survivors.
十多年前，克里姆林宫没收尤科斯石油公司（Yukos Oil，当时占俄罗斯产量的20 % ） 并逮捕其创始人霍多尔科夫斯基（Mikhail Khodorkovsky ） ， 以伪造的逃税罪名关了他十年（因为他胆敢反对普京 ） 。	More than a decade ago, the Kremlin expropriated Yukos Oil, which at the time produced 20% of Russia’s output, and jailed its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, for ten years on trumped-up tax evasion charges after he dared to oppose Putin.

中国的年GDP增长率从2010年一季度的峰值11.9%下降至2012年二季度的7.6 % ， 降幅只有大衰退期间8.2个百分点的一半。	From a peak of 11.9% in the first quarter of 2010, China’s annual GDP growth slowed to 7.6% in the second quarter of 2012 – only about half the outsize 8.2-percentage-point deceleration experienced during the Great Recession.
与哥伦比亚革命武装力量达成协议结束冲突意味着该组织解除武装和遣散人员，这能使哥伦比亚的星空比以往任何时候都更明亮。	Reaching an agreement with the FARC to end the conflict – which implies the group’s disarmament and demobilization – would allow Colombia’s star to shine more brightly than ever.
今年7月，受到高度关注的曼谷第15届国际艾滋病大会召开期间，温家宝总理宣布中国将全力制止艾滋病的蔓延。	This past July, during the highly publicized 15th International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Premier Wen Jiabao declared all-out war against the burgeoning epidemic.

然而，1979~1980年间，美国政治氛围发生了转变，其高潮出现在里根（Ronald Reagan）当选美国总统之际。 这一转变使得拥护自由市场和创新的势力迅速崛起，同社会民主式的社团主义（corporatism）以及政治中间派形成尖锐对立。	But the political shift of 1979-1980, culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan, brought about a new opposition of the free market and innovation to social-democratic corporatism and centrism.
而作为总统，他却把联邦紧急措施署当作了论功行赏的工具，任命缺乏灾难管理经验的政治亲信担任紧急措施署的高官。	As president, he treated it as a source of patronage, replacing its top officials with political cronies who had little experience in managing emergencies.

与透明度、广泛代表性、问责制和在国内诉讼中使用科学或经济证据等相关的全球纪律 — — 只要不限制最终结果 — — 都是上述规定的实例。	Global disciplines pertaining to transparency, broad representation, accountability, and use of scientific or economic evidence in domestic proceedings – without constraining the end result – are examples of such requirements.

在1931年的奥地利，问题的根源是第一次世界大战奥匈帝国的解体，1920年代初的恶性通货膨胀，以及银行业为工业部门承担了过度的风险。	In Austria in 1931, the problem was rooted in the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, hyperinflation in the early 1920s, and banks’ excessive exposure to the industrial sector.
巴勒斯坦权力机构主席、与巴以和平进程有关的国家的高级外交官员、伊斯兰合作组织秘书长等人都将参加这次为期两天的峰会。	The Palestinian Authority’s president, senior diplomats of the countries involved in the Palestine-Israel peace process, and the secretary general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation all attended the two-day summit.
作为世界农业发展基金的一员，我们相信农业无论规模大小，都应被当作一门生意来看待，这些小农场生产者就是一批小老板，而不是等待救济的穷人。	At the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), we believe that farming, regardless of size or scale, must be seen as a business, and smallholder farmers as small-scale business owners rather than poor people who need handouts.
当Frank Luntz，一位著名的共和党政治顾问在2002年将一份战略备忘录交给他的客户时，这种攻势的证据就浮出水面了。	Evidence of this surfaced when Frank Luntz, a leading Republican political consultant, sent a strategy memo to his clients in 2002.
当韩国这样的东亚国家通过这类政策来让特定行业进行全球范围竞争时，拉丁美洲和加勒比国家却几乎没有走对过路子。	While East Asian countries like South Korea used such policies to enable selected industries to compete on a global scale, Latin American and Caribbean countries rarely got it right.
法国的高等教育体系十分独特，这是拜其大学和一小撮被称为“大学校 ” （ grandes écoles）的精英学校之间的深刻差距所赐。	France’s system of higher education is unique, owing to the deep divide between its universities and a few elite schools known as “grandes écoles.”
在癌细胞转变为肿瘤之前，用RARP抑制剂治疗那些携带BRCA1或BRCA2变异体的妇女是防癌方面一个全新的、大有前途的理念。	Treating women carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations with PARP inhibitors to kill cancer cells before they grow into tumors is a new and hopeful concept in cancer prevention.
信贷增长的速度因此从2008年9月的14%一举上升到一年后的35 % ， 很多城市的房价也随之翻番。	As a result, the rate of credit growth increased from 14% in September 2008 to 35% a year later, and property prices more than doubled in many cities.
其他东欧前共产主义国家 — — 即立陶宛、乌克兰和匈牙利 — — 也偏好于牺牲和抵抗的民族主义叙事。	Other former communist countries in Eastern Europe – namely, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Hungary – have also come to favor a nationalist narrative of victimhood and resistance.
以至于特朗普政府最近提出一项对两方面都有所兼顾的移民改革计划立刻遭到了反移民活动家和亲移民分子两方的夹攻。	Thus, when the Trump White House recently proposed a plan for immigration reform that offered something to both sides, it was instantly denounced by anti-immigration activists and pro-immigration crusaders alike.
此外，12月美国宣布向马政府出售价值18.3亿美元的武器同样明确表示了对台湾的支持，此举似乎已经准备放弃国民党。	Moreover, the announcement in December that the US is to sell $1.83 billion in weapons to the Ma government is also a clear show of support for Taiwan, which already appeared ready to renounce the Kuomintang.
比方说巴西，其货币雷亚尔从2014年年中开始就一直遭受重创 — — 雷亚尔所受的打击比其他多数 新兴市场货币更为严重 — — 究其原因主要是那里发生的一次重大腐败丑闻。	Consider Brazil, whose currency, the real, has been hammered since mid-2014 – much worse than most other emerging-market currencies – largely because of a major corruption scandal unfolding there.
反对势力认为莫拉莱斯正在恢复专制元首的传统，将大权独揽到自己一人手中，让政府机构仅仅剩下形式上的作用。	According to his opponents, Morales is reproducing the tradition of caudillismo, concentrating power in his hands and turning government institutions into mere formalities.
再加上美国的避险地位，以及美国利率的任何重新定价肯定会反映经济复苏的事实，对美国国债的购买欲望必定极为强烈。	Add to that America’s safe-haven status, and the fact that any re-pricing of US rates surely would reflect an economic resurgence, and the bid for US Treasuries should be exceptionally strong.
全球经济的快速变化让很多人一下子无法理解正在发生什么、这对增长、稳定、收入分配和就业意味着什么。 在这样的情况下，困难再自然不过了。	That is an inherently difficult task at a time when rapid change in the global economy has left many still trying to understand what is happening and what it all means for growth, stability, the distribution of income, and employment.
这意味着从2010年伊始就开始上调基准政策利率13倍以应对依然严重的通胀局面的印度储备银行很难切实放松货币政策。	That means that the Reserve Bank of India – which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still-serious inflation problem – can ill afford to ease monetary policy.
四十年来，位于尼科西亚市中心的莱德拉街始终是塞浦路斯分裂的象征；而在两年前的那个四月，将首都分为南北两部分的高墙终于被打开了缺口。	Last week, I visited the Ledra Street crossing. Officially, I was there to inaugurate a reconstruction plan for buildings that had fallen into disrepair in the old buffer zone.
当然，中国与阿拉伯国家的经济关系十多年来一直在加强，贸易额从2004年的255亿美元增加到2013年的2,389亿美元。	Of course, economic ties between China and Arab countries have been growing stronger for more than a decade, with the trade volume increasing from $25.5 billion in 2004 to $238.9 billion in 2013.

在银行股东血本无归、债权人遭遇8%的“剃头”后，欧洲基金本身将转变为援助基金，这在某种程度上证实了德国人的担忧。	After a bank’s shareholders are wiped out and its creditors take an 8% “haircut,” the European Fund transforms itself into a bailout fund, justifying some of Germany’s fears.
他是前“红色高棉”的五个高级领导人之一，这些人都要为其在波尔布特大屠杀中所扮演的角色接受审判。 在这次屠杀中有170万名柬埔寨人丧生。	He is one of five former senior Khmer Rouge leaders who will be made to answer for their roles during Pol Pot’s genocide, in which an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians perished.
但主要商业组织Cosep主管阿圭里（José Adán Aguerri）站出来为政府辩护。 如果美国大使馆向他提供一份面临刁难的外国公司名单，阿圭里说，他能够确保它们的问题得到解决。	If the US Embassy provided him with a list of foreign companies facing obstacles, Aguerri claimed, he would ensure that their problems were solved.
认知技术学家史蒂夫·托伦斯（Steve Torrance）已经指出强大的新技术，诸如汽车，计算机和电话，有一种不受控制快速扩散的趋势。	The cognitive scientist Steve Torrance has pointed out that powerful new technologies, like cars, computers, and phones, tend to spread rapidly, in an uncontrolled way.
而基拉里的任务则是要把一群素质参差不齐的自由战士训练成一支像样的军队。 但这一点点时间显然不足以去阻止苏联进军。	His task was to knock the rag-tag freedom fighters into an army, but there wasn’t time to stop the Soviet advance.
他们必须发展一支经验丰富的了解风险管理运作的专业队伍，必须培训工会会员遇到具体的金融问题时懂得如何处置。	They must develop a cadre of professionals with a sophisticated understanding of risk management, and must work to educate their members in the financial subtleties of their specific circumstances.
对人类白细胞抗原基因的研究 — — 作为人类免疫反应的一部分 — — 显示这一个共同祖先不可能存在；这个基因组源自于已知的三种古人。	Research on the human leukocyte antigen genes, which are involved in the human immune response, shows that such a common ancestor could not have existed; this group of genes derives from those of all three known ancient humans.
就像国际货币基金组织总裁克里斯蒂娜·拉加德在12月的一次演讲中所说的那样 ， “ 阳光正在穿透乌云，并协助绝大多数经济体取得自金融危机以来最强劲的发展 。 ”	As Christine Lagarde, the Fund’s managing director, put it in a speech in December, “The sun is shining through the clouds and helping most economies generate the strongest growth since the financial crisis.”
在他们以“弗兰克·阿克莱特（Frank Arkright ） ” 为笔名发表的《什么是专家治国》一书中，他们提出了将经济“构建在能量基础之上”来解决失业问题的观点。	In their book The A B C of Technocracy, published under the pseudonym Frank Arkright, they advanced the idea that putting the economy “on an energy basis” would overcome the unemployment problem.
加州克莱蒙特 — — 40年前美国总统理查德·尼克松踏上访华之路时，他不可能想象到自己这次赌博会释放多大能量。	CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – When US President Richard Nixon embarked on his historic trip to China 40 years ago, he could not have imagined what his gamble would unleash.
偶尔能从鼓吹这些政策的新自由主义经济学家那里听到的一个答案是人们其实已经过得更好了，只是他们没有意识到而已。	One answer occasionally heard from the neoliberal economists who advocated for these policies is that people are better off.
但是，成功地将这些进步转化为下一代疫苗的开发仍受到我们关于人体对具体细菌、病毒和寄生虫的免疫反应的了解不足的制约。	However, successfully translating these advances into the development of next-generation vaccines continues to be impeded by gaps in our understanding of the human immune response that protects against specific bacteria, viruses, or parasites.
欧元区需要这样的解决方案：它不会强迫任何一个或一些国家承受调整的主要成本。 这意味着对货币联盟做有控制的分割。	What the eurozone needs is a solution that does not force any one country or group of countries to bear the brunt of the adjustment – and that means a controlled segmentation of the currency union.
与其大部分前任直到快下台才这么做不同，特朗普从上任之初就拿出了和平协定动议，从而让他的立场显得更加有力、更加令人信服、更有承诺性质，这对于形势很有帮助。	It helps that, unlike most of his predecessors, Trump is initiating his bid for a peace agreement at the outset of his term, rather than in its twilight, thereby imbuing his position with a sense of vigor, conviction, and commitment.
英特尔被指控通过所谓的“掠夺性定价 ” （ 以低于成本的价格销售产品）以及提供高额的回扣以维护市场份额并且削弱其主要竞争对手先进微器件公司而在“滥用”其占主导的市场地位。	Intel is charged with “abusing” its dominant market position by so called “predatory pricing” (selling below cost) and offering substantial rebates to retain market share and undermine its arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices.
时至今日，虽然时间有所推迟，但毛泽东赶超世界水平的梦想终于得到了实现，中国的钢铁年产量已经达到 6.6 亿吨，而其他工业部门也同样如此。	Today, Mao’s dream of catching up with the rest of the world has been realized, albeit a bit behind schedule, not only in steel making, where annual capacity has reached 660 million tons, but in many other sectors as well.
当年7月，美国驻叙利亚大使福特（Robert S. Ford）被派往逊尼派小镇哈马（Hama ） 。 30年前，巴沙尔之父下令在这里进行大屠杀。	In July of that year, Robert S. Ford, the US ambassador to Syria, was sent to the Sunni town of Hama, where Assad’s father had ordered a massacre 30 years earlier.
如果医生建议采用极为昂贵而又没有效果的阿斯匹林来治疗腿坏疽是因为阿斯匹林的成本要低于断腿的代价，那么我们将永远不会接受。	We would never accept medical practitioners advising ultra-expensive and ineffective aspirins for gangrene because the cost of aspirin outweighs the cost of losing the leg.
关于警察根据调查对象的种族或者宗教背景对当事人进行问询的事例，其他一些主要欧洲国家还没有搜集相关数据。	Other major European countries do not collect data on police stops broken down according to the targets’ ethnic or religious background.
集合来自商界、业界、劳工、政府、学者和公民社会的声音 — — 并且尽可能频繁地集合这些声音 — — 正是我们现在所需要做的事。	Convening diverse voices from business, industry, labor, government, academia, and civil society – and doing so as frequently as possible – is exactly what is needed right now.
瑙鲁协定缔约国承诺实现渔业信息完全透明并推行社区发展配额计划旨在将更大部分金枪鱼创造的财富留在太平洋国家。	The commitment to full transparency and the launch of a CDQ-type initiative for PNA states are intended to keep more tuna wealth in the Pacific.
最终，下一个十年的特点是，欧洲继续依赖于俄罗斯的天然气，但是俄罗斯需要出口收入将使它依赖于欧洲，二者之间取得微妙的平衡。	In the end, the next decade will be marked by a delicate balance in which Europe remains dependent on Russian gas, but Russia’s need for export revenues will also make it dependent on Europe.
这种战略让公众所产生的兴趣并不会随着布什政府的终结而结束，因为新保守主义依靠的深深植根于美国历史的公众对许多问题的担忧。	That strategy’s popular appeal will not end with the Bush administration, because neo-conservatism feeds on a set of public fears that are deeply rooted in American history.
英国ICB正确地指出，从当前软弱无能的监管框架看，竞争和稳定的都具有改善空间，但要将市场力量从银行业中完全剔除是很不明智的。	The UK’s ICB has rightly stated that there is room to improve both competition and stability, given the current weak regulatory framework, but it would be imprudent to strive for the complete elimination of market power in banking.
这些惊人的数字引发了人们对西方金融系统稳定性的普遍忧虑。 这几乎抵消了之前我们所作出的一切努力，例如包括建立“坏帐银行”和用政府的信用担保来解决信贷市场的问题等。	These frightening numbers raise doubts about the stability of the West’s financial system, and they dwarf all measures, such as “bad banks” and government guarantees, that attempt to solve a mere liquidity crisis.
美国目前的最大的损失源于间谍和犯罪活动，但在未来十年左右的时间里，战争和恐怖主义可能造成比今天更大的威胁。	For the US, the highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime, but over the next decade or so, war and terrorism could become greater threats than they are today.
某些人认为，问题出在于与人口增长放缓，预期寿命延长，以及一成不变的退休年龄界定相关的过度储蓄之上 — — 这迫使人们要为自己的老年准备更多的钱。	For some, the problem is a savings glut associated with slower demographic growth, rising life expectancy, and static retirement thresholds – a combination that forces people to save more for their old age.
相反，方济各似乎在其《福音书的快乐 》 （ The Joy of the Gospel）中便将工厂化饲养的动物称为“孱弱的、毫无防备的生物，任由经济利益无差别剥削宰割 。 ”	Francis, by contrast, appears to have been referring to factory-farmed animals when he spoke, in The Joy of the Gospel, of “weak and defenseless beings who are frequently at the mercy of economic interests or indiscriminate exploitation.”
在如此大笔的支出之下，政府就成为了那些像养老金收益一样（轻易获得）的合同来源，这就为那些有政治后台的人提供了丰厚的回报。	With so much largesse to spread around, the government became a source of contracts with annuity-like earnings, which offered robust returns for those with political access.
他们会揭竿而起，拒绝接受他们的不断扩大定居所的二等公民地位，他们将动摇肯尼亚这样的国家，威胁到建设更稳定、更繁荣社会的努力。	They will rise up, refusing to accept their status as second-class citizens of ever-expanding urban settlements, and they will destabilize countries like Kenya, undermining efforts to build more stable, prosperous societies.
加税只是其中一部分，如果没有一个增长战略，一个减少政府支出的举措以及遏制通货紧缩政策的话，加税也不能解决问题。	A tax hike is only part of that. Without a strategy for growth, an effort to reduce government spending, and a policy to stop deflation, a tax hike will not solve the problem.
在这一镇压和干预民主的背景下，伊斯兰教在埃及和土耳其的失败所揭示的伊斯兰教与民主的兼容性问题并不像我们想象的那样严重。	Given this backdrop of repression and punctuated democracy, the failure of Islamists in Egypt and Turkey tells us less about Islam’s compatibility with democracy than we might think.
坐视不管、默许卡扎菲压迫本国民众、并以此向全世界暴君发出国内恐怖活动可以接受的信号，这样做其实蕴含着更大的风险。	The cost of non-intervention, of allowing Qaddafi to crush his own people, and of thus signaling to the world’s despots that a campaign of domestic terror is acceptable, is far more menacing.
在气候变化、有组织犯罪、贸易活动和预防暴力等全球重大问题上，如果没有美国积极参与谈判并起到政策催化剂的作用，国际社会将快速深切地感受到谈判的难度。	And, on big global issues like climate change, organized crime, trade, and prevention of atrocities, the absence of the US as a policy catalyst and active negotiator will be quickly and keenly felt.
在5月意大利七国峰会上与特朗普一次令人恼怒的会面后，默克尔总结的观点现在得到了绝大多数欧洲领导人的认同。	After a vexing encounter with Trump at the G7 summit in Italy in May, Merkel summed up a sentiment that most other European leaders now share.
马德里 — — 尽管法国各地大规模团结集会给人留下了相反的印象，但最近针对讽刺杂志《查理周刊》的袭击并不意味着西欧的言论自由正面临任何严重威胁。	MADRID – Despite the impression given by massive unity rallies throughout France, the recent attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo does not mean that freedom of expression is under any serious threat in Western Europe.
本世纪以来，有一百多万人因为黑格比和其他大灾难而丧生 — — 如2010年的海地地震，造成的总经济损失接近2万亿美元。	Since the beginning of the century, more than a million people have died in storms like Hagupit and other major disasters, such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake, with economic damage totaling nearly $2 trillion.
当年诺贝尔奖经济学奖得主加里·贝克尔（Gary Becker）可以认定在竞争激烈的市场上歧视是不可能存在的；市场会提高所有收入不足者的工资。	Back then, the Nobel laureate economist Gary Becker could write that in a competitive market, discrimination was impossible; the market would bid up the wage of anyone who was underpaid.
如此，我们可以得到一个简单的结论：欧元区长期稳定更加取决于完整的欧洲银行联盟计划，而不是为欧元区建立新的预算。	This leads to a simple conclusion: The euro’s long-term stability depends far more on completing plans for a European banking union than it does on creating some new budget for the eurozone.
通过削弱所谓的玻利瓦尔轴心（委内瑞拉、厄瓜多尔和玻利维亚 ） ， FARC游击队不再拥有支持他们的地区环境了。	By weakening the so-called Bolivarian Axis (Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia), the FARC guerrillas were left without a supportive regional environment.
周期性泡沫也许是不可避免的，但所有泡沫都会带来后果，高杠杆泡沫往往造成更大的破坏，因为其对实体经济的极大影响和持续漫长的去杠杆化过程。	While periodic bubbles may be unavoidable, and no bubble is without consequences, a highly leveraged bubble tends to cause far more damage, owing to its impact on the real economy and the duration of the deleveraging process.
但是，伊朗的统治集团并不完全都是顽固的极权主义者；领导层中间都严重的分歧，并且有很多人不想看到伊朗被国际孤立。	The Iranian regime is not, however, a totalitarian juggernaut; there are important splits within the leadership and there is an important faction that does not want Iran to be isolated.
从理论上讲，这已经发生了：出生于一个贫穷贱民家庭的雷克南·纳拉亚南，从1997年到2002年间担任过印度总统，这是这个国家的最高职位。	In theory, this already has happened: K. R. Narayanan, born into a poor Dalit family, served as India’s president, the highest office in the land, from 1997 to 2002.
但如果特朗普利用赦免权来保护自己的家庭就会造成严重的问题 — — 鉴于联邦调查局很快就要对其亲信与俄罗斯的交易展开调查，这样的状况并非杞人忧天。	But a serious problem will arise if Trump attempts to use it to protect his family – not a farfetched scenario, given pending FBI investigations into his inner circle’s dealings with Russia.
显然，问题在于全球金融体系本身的不稳定性 — — 层出不穷的狂热和泡沫以及随之而来的不受监管和监督的金融市场常见的突然停止和急剧逆转。	It became clearer that the problem lay with instability in the global financial system itself – the bouts of euphoria and bubbles, followed by the sudden stops and sharp reversals that are endemic to unsupervised and unregulated financial markets.
叙利亚战争之所以持续了如此长时间，部分原因在于叙利亚政府以及与之对抗的武装组织认为都认为自己最后会胜出。	The war has continued for so long, in part, because both the Syrian government and the armed groups it is fighting believed that they would ultimately prevail.
但再假设这位经济学家继续指出，因此，给病人使用盘尼西林是愚蠢的，因为我们知道98%的可治疗疾病是通过传统药物治愈的，而盘尼西林不属于传统药物。	But now suppose that the economist goes on to argue that, therefore, it would be silly to give patients penicillin, because we know that 98% of all treatable diseases were cured by tradicines, and penicillin is not a tradicine.
在阿拉伯世界的黄金时代，比如11世纪的巴格达和14世纪的安达卢西亚地区，都被考证为学习和教育发展的鼎盛时期。	The Arab golden ages, in eleventh-century Baghdad and fourteenth-century Andalucía, are revered as periods of great learning.
如果这一行动能得到合理执行的话 — — 那些大型但可能 — — 资本充足率不足但而还能自负盈亏的银行将被迫额外筹集资本（如果有必要的话将来自债券持有人 ） ， 而那些无法正常运行的银行则会被关停。	If this exercise is conducted properly – a big if – undercapitalized banks that are viable would be forced to raise additional equity, from bondholders if necessary, while unviable ones would be wound down.
相反，是家长们争先恐后把孩子送进最棒的学校，好让他们在竞争中领先－全世界的父母都是这样－但只有在生活富裕之后。	Instead, parents pushed their children towards the best schools to give them an individual head start – something parents do the world over – only after they got richer.
联合国可持续发展解决方案网（Sustainable Development Solutions Network）是潘基文的力作，意在动员全球知识拯救地球。	The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network is a powerful effort to mobilize global knowledge to save the planet.
一位共和党参议员 — — 缅因州的斯诺威（Olympia Snowe）在委员会中投票赞成，但随后反悔，威胁要以冗长演说扼杀这一法案，并投票反对它的最后通过。	One Republican senator – Olympia Snowe of Maine – voted for it in committee, but then switched sides, threatened to kill it via filibuster, and voted against its final passage.
但是以色列在1967年对三支阿拉伯军队所取得的令人惊叹的胜利给它带来的不仅仅是荣耀，还有道义和政治上的腐朽。	But Israel’s breathtaking victory against three Arab armies in 1967 brought it not only grandeur, but also moral and political decay.
2008年由美国房地产市场崩盘所引发的全球金融危机为我们带来了重要的教训，表明了金融体系在面对住房市场崩溃时的脆弱性。	The global financial crisis that the US housing-market crash triggered in 2008 carried important lessons about how fragile the financial system is in the face of a housing-market collapse.
17%的英国家庭买不起能源 — — 换句话说他们被迫把10%的收入花在能源上；而且因为老年人经济能力普遍较差，约有四分之一的老年家庭陷入能源贫穷。	Some 17% of households are now energy poor – that is, they have to spend more than 10% of their income on energy; and, because elderly people are typically poorer, about a quarter of their households are energy poor.
其中最显着的障碍是无法迫使一些顺差经济体去追求刺激增长型政策，也因此无法弥补逆差国家因调整而遭受的经济衰退影响。	Among the most notable obstacles has been the inability to compel some surplus economies to pursue growth-stimulating policies, which would compensate for the recessionary effects of adjustment in the deficit countries.
对此威廉·克莱恩（William Cline）试图为银行资本的适当水平提供一个理论基础而撰写的《银行的正确平衡》一书为我们缓解了焦虑。	So it was a relief to encounter William Cline’s book The Right Balance for Banks, which attempts to produce a rationale for the appropriate level of bank capital.
最新日本海上安保厅（Japanese Coastguard）数据表明，中国进入东海钓鱼岛地区的次数大幅下降。	Recent Japanese Coastguard data indicate a drastic reduction in Chinese incursions into the Senkaku/Diaoyu area in the East China Sea.
但如果制裁针对的是某个国家，其最终效果可能要更多依赖其他国家的参与，而其他国家参与需要消耗政治资本去争取。	But when sanctions target a country, their effectiveness depends much more on other countries’ participation, which can cost political capital to secure.
利比亚正经历着一场你死我活的斗争，一边是坚持追求变革的人民，另一边则是在实施了40年暴政后依然负隅顽抗的贪婪政权。	Libya is experiencing a deadly struggle between people insisting on change, and a desperate, greedy regime determined to cling to power after 40 years of crass misrule.
许多亚洲人仍记得日本在二战前和二战期间试图通过征服建立“大东亚共荣圈 ” ， 即日本统治下的自给自足的国家圈。	Many Asians still remember Japanese efforts before and during World War II to create a “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” – a self-sufficient bloc of countries, under Japan’s leadership – through conquest.
这项税收按每GB 0.50欧元一刀切征收，其占总ICT支出的比重将随每GB成本的下降（几乎是必然事件）而上升。	Because the tax was a flat €0.50 per gigabyte, its share in total ICT spending would rise as the cost of a gigabyte fell – as it is almost guaranteed to do.
政府还要求该团体变更名称，从澳大利亚疫苗网络（Australian Vaccination Network）改为澳大利亚疫苗质疑网络（Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network ） ， 从而明确该鼓吹团体的态度。	The government has also required the group to change its name, from the Australian Vaccination Network to the Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network, in order to make the advocate’s perspective clear.
更重要的是，数年后，美国法院接受了由抵制派债权人提出的平等权利条款的全新解释（几乎其他所有主权金融主流参与者及从业者都拒绝接受这一解释 ） 。	More important, years later, US courts accepted a novel interpretation of the pari passu clause advanced by holdout creditors (and rejected by virtually all other mainstream participants and practitioners in sovereign finance).
正如《2013年世界粮食不安全状况》报告所指出的那样，2000年来消除饥饿和营养不良的步伐有所放缓，粮价在经历近半个世纪的下降后开始重拾升势。	As SOFI 2013 points out, progress toward eradicating hunger and undernourishment has slowed since 2000, when food prices began to rise, following almost a half-century of decline.
许多政策制定者们似乎有这样一种印象，即由于各大经济体继续摆脱2001年的衰退，利润的暴涨纯粹是一种周期性的现象。	Many policymakers seem to be under the impression that surging profits are a purely cyclical phenomenon, as economies continue to grow out from the depths of the 2001 recession.
但如今我们有理由相信未来经济学家的结论和政策建议将不再由框架的优美程度决定，而由它们是否能够符合事实决定。	But now there is reason to hope that, in the future, economists’ conclusions and policy advice will be shaped not by those frameworks’ elegance, but by their ability to fit the facts.
美国人口只占全世界的4.4 % ， 占世界产出的比重也在下降，它可能沉迷于主宰全球的幻觉，发动新军备竞赛和采取保护主义贸易政策。	With just 4.4% of the world’s population and a falling share of world output, the US might try to hang on to its delusion of global dominance through a new arms race and protectionist trade policies.
相反，沙特人为巴基斯坦国提供过资金支持，并且在其现任总理沙里夫1999年被军事政变推翻后逃亡期间提供过慷慨的收容。	On the contrary, the Saudis have bankrolled the Pakistani state, and proved a generous host to its current prime minister, Mian Nawaz Sharif, during his long exile following the military coup that toppled his government in 1999.
当足够比例的债权人批准重组计划时（在阿根廷的例子中，90%的该国债务持有人同意重组 ） ， 其他人也将被迫同意。	When a sufficient proportion of creditors agree to a restructuring plan (in the case of Argentina, the holders of more than 90% of the country’s debt did), the others can be forced to go along.
令人困惑的税率、过多的记录文件和人们对执行合规要求的忧虑已经引发了人们对国家商品和服务税可能损害民生的担忧。	The confusing tax rates, excessive documentation, and anxiety over the implementation of compliance requirements has prompted fears that the GST will damage people’s livelihoods.
普林斯顿 — — 财政联盟往往是提升信誉的有效方式，还可以在广袤地理区域的不同民族间创造出新的团结意识。	PRINCETON – Fiscal unification is often an effective way to enhance creditworthiness, and it may also create a new sense of solidarity among diverse peoples living within a large geographic area.
比如，PISA评估表明，尽管日本学生长于复述学到的知识，但被问及需要创造性地应用所学知识的外延性问题时往往难于应付。	For example, PISA assessments have revealed that, while Japanese students excel at reproducing what they have learned, they often struggle when asked to extrapolate from that knowledge and apply it creatively.
它们对一系列非常规货币政策工具的使用取得了一些效果，也带来了严重的不确定性，世界经济也没有获得充分稳定。	While their use of a range of unconventional monetary-policy tools has had benefits, it has also generated significant uncertainty, without fully stabilizing the world economy.
土耳其作为��区性强国的出现与它们的不同之处在于其民主体制使它成为一个积极的调解人，而不是地区霸权。	Turkey’s arrival as a regional power is different in that its democratic structures make an active peacemaker, not a local bully.
但尽管南非选择了一条少有人走的路 — — 抵制民粹主义和威权主义的全球趋势 — — 该国其实依然身处于一个十字路口。	But while South Africa has taken the road less traveled – bucking the global trend toward populism and authoritarianism – the country remains at a crossroads.
伦敦—随着气候变化的加快，其影响令其他地缘政治和发展危机变得更加严重，环境保护在捍卫和改善人类福祉方面的作用也变得异常突出。	LONDON – With climate change accelerating and its effects exacerbating other geopolitical and development crises, the role of environmental protection in preserving and improving human wellbeing has become starkly apparent.
协约国需要做的是将德国赔款和协约国内部债务一笔勾销，同时发放大手笔重建贷款，让满目疮痍的欧洲经济重新站稳脚跟。	What was needed was cancelation of reparations and inter-Allied war debts as a whole, together with a big reconstruction loan to put the shattered European economies back on their feet.
即便如此，梅原本仍然可以对52%要求退出欧洲的选民说，她将把谈判交给相信这一结果的大臣团队，并及时将谈判结果提交给议会和人民。	Even so, May could have reacted to the 52% vote to quit Europe by saying that she would hand the negotiations to a group of ministers who believed in this outcome and then put the result of the talks in due course to parliament and the people.
但对日本来说，是否继续支持伊拉克重建已经不仅仅是这一特殊政策能带来多少好处，而是它关系到日本人的安全理念，以及什么才是日本国的利益。	But for Japan, the question of whether to continue to aid in Iraq's reconstruction extends beyond the merits of this particular policy and goes to the heart of Japanese notions of security and what constitutes the national interest.
如果商品价格上涨，在利用期货市场进行出口价格对冲方面做得很好的财政部长会猛然发现自己正在受千夫所指，说他败光了国家财产。	In the event of an increase in a commodity’s price, a finance minister who has done a perfect job of hedging export-price risk on the futures market will suddenly find himself accused of having gambled away the national patrimony.
会议真正的目的是让各自国家之间有个相互交流，而不是相互指责的机会，为了达到这个目标，我们还可以相应地做一些调整。	To meet this goal, some changes would be in order.
于是他们对“民族”大加颂扬并将政策聚焦于与其它国家的零和争端之上，同时找那些国内的邪恶“异己”作为替罪羊。	Thus they exalt the “nation” and focus their policies on zero-sum quarrels with other countries and on scapegoating deviant “aliens” at home.
支持小企业通常有助于社会政策目标 — — 维持经济中最贫困和最难找到工作的群体的收入水平，而不能刺激产出和生产率增长。	Support for small enterprises often serves social-policy goals – sustaining the incomes of the economy’s poorest and most excluded workers – instead of stimulating output and productivity growth.
达尔文解释道，这些品质是通过“运用选择、爱慕和嫉妒的影响以及声音、色彩和形状方面的审美”而代际传递并强化的。	Darwin explained that such qualities are propagated and enhanced over generations, through “the exertion of choice, the influence of love and jealousy, and the appreciation of the beautiful in sound, color, or form.”
让我们使各家各户都有以有助于让移民仅仅成为子孙后代的一种选择方式，而不是必经之路的方式使用辛苦挣得的金钱的能力。	Let us empower families to use their hard-earned money in ways that will help to make migration a matter of choice, not a necessity for the generations to come.
尚不清楚的是，如果特朗普所构想的边境墙被建造起来，美国将被迫付出多少 — — 面对因此导致的不确定性、破坏乃至政府关门。	What is less clear is how much Americans will be forced to pay – with uncertainty, disruption, and even a government shutdown – if Trump’s version of the wall is ever built.
再来回忆一下西方对前苏联和俄罗斯入侵具战略重要性的国家的反应：1956年的匈牙利、1968年的捷克斯洛伐克和2008年的格鲁吉亚。	Now recall Western responses to previous Soviet and Russian incursions into strategically important countries: Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, or Georgia in 2008.
（充分披露：我的公司正在与一家大型全球金融机构合作发布一系列关于发动大经济体和新兴市场股市的可交易股票指数，我们采用的是聪明贝塔方法 ） 。	(Full disclosure: my firm, together with a large global financial institution, is launching a series of tradable equity indices for stock markets of advanced economies and emerging markets, using a smart beta approach).
例如，加利福尼亚大学的巴伯和欧丁以及台湾国立政治大学的李怡宗和刘玉珍在2004年做的研究报告获得了台湾股票交易所中单个股民的交易数据。	For example, a 2004 study by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the University of California and Yi-Tsung Lee and Yiu-Jane Liu at National Chengchi University acquired trade-by-trade data on individual day traders on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.
在被美国贴上“邪恶轴心”的标签后，叙利亚发现沙特的财政援助也日渐干涸。 它还担心由于批准与欧盟的《联合协定》将会带来的贸易利益可能永远也无法实现。	Labelled by the US as part of the “axis of evil,” Syria has also seen Saudi financial aid dry up and fears that the trade benefits that would come with ratification of its Association Agreement with the EU will never materialize.
他们认为，所有这些流动性都去了某个地方，其合理的目的地就是拥有最复杂的金融市场的美国，并且在进入美国之后将美国的资产价格抬升到了无法持续的高度。	All that liquidity, they will argue, had to go somewhere. Its logical destination was the country with the deepest financial markets, the US, where it raised asset prices to unsustainable heights.
欧元区债务危机正在破坏规模更大、拥有27个成员国的欧盟的合作，造成最近峰会上关于欧盟预算方案的大失败。	The region’s debt crisis is undermining cooperation within the larger 27-member European Union, resulting in the spectacular failure of the recent summit on the EU budget.
20世纪70年代，美国研究人员曾预计实现核聚变发电并网需要在1990到2005年间每年20-30亿美元的研发投入（具体投资规模取决于工作量情况 ） 。	In the 1970s, American researchers estimated that getting fusion power on the grid would demand investment of $2-3 billion annually in research and development until anywhere from 1990 to 2005 (depending on the amount of effort applied).
雇主和雇员各自支付6.2%的现金收入，个人最高现金收入基数为128,000美元，随平均工资水平每年上涨。	Employers and employees each pay 6.2% of cash earnings up to an individual maximum of $128,000, an amount that increases annually with average wages.
发自伦敦 — — 当时是1946年，在大西洋这一侧，美国律师团正在纽伦堡以反人类罪起诉纳粹医生 — — 针对这些人对集中营里犯人进行的所谓“研究 ” 。	LONDON – It’s 1946. On one side of the Atlantic, American lawyers are prosecuting Nazi doctors at Nuremberg for crimes against humanity – so-called “research” carried out on concentration camp prisoners.
托尼·布莱尔、雅克·希拉克、柯菲·安南和其它人在阿拉法特死后的讲话都迫切要求尽快结束冲突，这样的解决已经来得太迟了。	Statements by Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, Kofi Annan and others on the occasion of Arafat’s death have been forceful in demanding a speedy and long overdue resolution of the conflict.
简言之，如今，以色列领导人推翻了他们与巴勒斯坦人进行和平谈判的承诺，国际社会也无法在认为这一普通方针仍然可行了。	Simply put, now that Israel’s leaders have renounced their commitment to a negotiated peace with Palestine, the international community can no longer justify the prevailing approach.
举例来讲，美国国会中赞同保护主义的民主党议员如果能够拒绝批准哥伦比亚自由贸易协定，就可以避免受到反对自由贸易的指责，即使他们很可能批准巴拿马和秘鲁贸易协定也改变不了这样的状况。	For example, protectionist Democrats in the US Congress have been able to insulate themselves from charges of opposing free trade if they scuttle Colombia’s FTA, because they will most likely ratify the deals for Panama and Peru.
标准解释是中国需求疲软，石油价格崩盘被广泛视为衰退的前兆，可能是中国衰退，也可能是整个全球经济衰退。	The standard explanation is weak Chinese demand, with the oil-price collapse widely regarded as a portent of recession, either in China or for the entire global economy.
他说，1849年，当时的锡克王国将这个钻石作为刚刚结束的盎格鲁-锡克战争的“自愿赔款”送给英国东印度公司的。	He claims that the erstwhile Sikh kingdom offered the gem to the British East India Company in 1849 as “voluntary compensation” for the expenses of the just-concluded Anglo-Sikh wars.
但美国也有意识地淡化这一管理手段，不与台湾进行最高级别的互动，这样做的意思是破除台湾果真宣布独立还能获得美国支持的幻想。	But the US deliberately attenuates this message by refusing to engage with Taiwan at the highest levels, which is meant to disabuse Taiwan of the notion that it can count on American support if the island ever actually declares independence.
事实上，随着对宪法规定的条约的蔑视，欧洲丧失的最重要的东西现在是显而易见的：它丧失了它对自身和对自己的共同的前途的信念。	Indeed, what Europe lost, first and foremost, with the rejection of the constitutional treaty is now obvious: its faith in itself and its common future.
这是非常惊人的回报，一个由诺贝尔奖得主组成的委员会研究了联合国的新全球目标，结论是控制结核病是应该列为全球重中之重的19项卓越发展投资之一。	Those are outstanding returns, and a panel of Nobel laureates that studied the United Nations’ new Global Goals determined that controlling TB is one of 19 phenomenal development investments that should be given high priority globally.
一些国家 — — 比如加纳、尼日利亚、肯尼亚、埃塞俄比亚、南非、卢旺达、乌干达、安哥拉、莫桑比克和津巴布韦 — — 因与中国有涉而获益良多，目前已步入世界增长最快经济体行列。	Some countries – for example, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe – have benefited substantially from Chinese involvement, and now rank among the world’s fastest-growing economies.
不出一年，他就从一位政坛菜鸟，在没有建制派支持的情况下，摇身一变成为法国总统，并领导新成立的政党在议会中赢得巨大的多数优势。	Within a year, he has gone from inexperienced political underdog, with no establishment backing, to President of the French Republic and leader of a newly created political party with an impressive parliamentary majority.
假设互联网宽带在一分钟内所提供的机会让你在这段时间的效用 — — 即你得到的乐趣 — — 至少增加一倍。	Assume for a minute that the opportunities provided by the rollout of broadband Internet has at least doubled the utility – the pleasure – that we get during that time.
去询问消费者 ： “ 我们应该如何使用您和我们分享或者通过Intercom这类服务获取的信息 ？ ”	Ask the customer: “How may we use the information you share with us, or that we receive from services like Intercom?”
在阿富汗，在社区舒拉和保护委员会的合作下，德高望重的伊玛目有时会利用他们的礼拜五布道（Friday sermon）宣传伊教育在伊斯兰教中的重要性。	In Afghanistan, in collaboration with community shuras and protection committees, respected imams sometimes use their Friday sermons to raise awareness about the importance of education in Islam.
尽管印度只有12%上网（即现在的互联网渗透率 ） ， 但已成为世界第三大在线市场，也是规模增长最迅速的在线市场。	Even 12% of India’s population – the extent of Internet penetration today – makes the country the world’s third-largest online market, and also the fastest growing for its size.
更近一些的2014年美国中期选举中，共和党强调美国的弱点，并制作广告暗示伊斯兰国派出感染埃博拉病毒的特工杀死美国人。	Still more recently, in the 2014 US midterm elections, Republicans emphasized the US’s vulnerabilities, and aired advertisements hinting that the Islamic State was directing Ebola-infected agents to kill Americans.
想要对大银行的这些自吹自擂之声充耳不闻是很困难的，因为银行家最擅长的事情就是将自身利益说成与公共利益完全一致。	It is impossible not to hear in such nonsense the cocksure drumbeat of the Money Power, which has never failed to identify the public interest with its own.
维尔莱格认为，能源独立“可能将世界带入新美国世纪（New American Century ） ， 形成一个美国能够以比世界其他地方低得多的成本获得能源的经济环境 ” 。	Verleger argues that energy independence “could make this the New American Century by creating an economic environment where the United States enjoys access to energy supplies at much lower cost than other parts of the world.”
美国的主要贸易伙伴可能不想一下子就这样做；有时威胁同样令人不安 — — 因此作为谈判筹码具有同样的效果。	America’s major trading partners may not want to do this in one fell swoop; sometimes threats are just as unsettling – and thus just as effective as a bargaining chip.
虽然这些经济体也都各自面临着挑战，但它们的人口结构更为合理、正在经历快速的城市化、并拥有极大的生产力增长潜力。	After all, while these economies are facing challenges of their own, they enjoy more favorable demographics and are experiencing rapid urbanization.
新德里—印度总理莫迪在圣诞节出人意料地访问了巴基斯坦拉合尔，以极其吸引眼球的方式为他无比活跃的全球外交之年画上了句号。	NEW DELHI – Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Lahore, Pakistan, on Christmas Day brought his hyperkinetic year of global diplomacy to a headline-grabbing close.
过去的几周以色列发生了大规模的示威，有的几乎已经到了暴力冲突的边缘；许多定居者已宣布他们不会遵从政府的命令撤离定居点。	The last weeks have seen massive demonstrations, some of them verging on violence; many of the settlers have declared that they will not obey government orders to evacuate.
二是一旦选民们发现那些政府负责人失去了他们最宝贵的品质：疑罪从无（意指在不确定伊拉克是否有策划发动“9·11”的情况下发动战争）之时，就会倾向于推翻政府。	Voters tend to get rid of governments once the incumbents have lost their most precious attribute: the benefit of the doubt.
最后，我们应当申明虽然我们西方国家不赞同中国的重商主义及其在国内实行的压制政策，但我们不想排挤和羞辱这个大国，而是希望与它合作。	Finally, we should assert that, while we in the West do not agree with China’s mercantilist policies and repressive measures at home, we want to work with it, not seek to marginalize and humiliate it.
尽管以色列还在黎巴嫩和加沙进行战争，阿拉伯人仍然承诺一旦以色列撤出1967年占领的土地，就与其实现关系正常化。	Despite the Israeli wars on Lebanon and Gaza, Arabs offered normal relations with Israel once it quits the lands that it occupied in 1967.
对于笃信多元化好处的人来说，加州代表了人类历史上最大的社会实验，它把不同背景的人融合在一起，这样的方式在德国、中国或巴西是难以想象的。	For believers in the benefits of diversity, California represents the largest social experiment in human history, bringing people of different backgrounds together in a way unimaginable in, say, Germany, China, or Brazil.
但问题依然：9月8日来临时，纳瓦尔尼及其支持者能否改变俄罗斯恐惧的政治文化？ 还是迈斯特会笑到最后？	But the question remains: Come September 8, can Navalny and his supporters change Russia’s political culture of fear, or was de Maistre right after all?
尽管两国怀恨在心的边界争端还有待解决，而且中国还是印度在巴基斯坦的敌人的主要盟国和军火供应国，双边关系在最近几年已经变暖。	Though their bitter border dispute remains unresolved, and China has been a vital ally and military supplier to India’s enemies in Pakistan, bilateral relations have grown warmer in recent years.
已故的耶鲁经济学家古斯塔夫·拉尼斯（Gustav Ranis）在近20年前观察道，成功而可持续的发展的关键是“避免思维僵化 ” 。	As the late Yale economist Gustav Ranis observed nearly 20 years ago, the key to successful and sustainable development is “avoiding the encrustation of ideas.”
其二，克鲁格曼没有解释为何在2008~2009年被证明有效的凯恩斯主义政策会如此迅速地被财政紧缩政策逆转和取代。	Second, Krugman fails to explain why the Keynesian policies vindicated in 2008-2009 were so rapidly reversed and replaced by fiscal austerity.
事实上，Uber还只是问题较少的创新之一，因为它无疑是净就业机会的创造者；相反，能够取代呼叫中心工作人员的电脑崛起正在造成大规模的就业净损失。	And, in fact, Uber is one of the less problematic innovations, because it is a net job creator; the rise of computers capable of replacing call-center workers, by contrast, is resulting in large net job losses.
301部分报告对中国境外投资的指责 — — 即中国利用“政府资本和高度隐秘的投资者网络来促进对海外高科技企业的收购 ” — —也同样站不住脚。	The Section 301 report’s accusations regarding outbound investment – namely, that China uses “government capital and highly opaque investor networks to facilitate high-tech acquisitions abroad” – are similarly flimsy.
和改革计划的其他方面一样，在这方面的变化是危险的；但习近平似乎认定如果中国想要朝着建设中产阶级数字时代经济迈出关键步骤，勇往直前是至关重要的。	Here, as in other areas of the reform plan, change is dangerous; but Xi has come to believe that pressing ahead is vitally important if China is to take the next crucial steps toward building a middle-class, digital-age economy.
只有经济机会才能催生稳定，当越来越多的年轻人能找到工作、养家糊口，而不是靠暴力斗争来改变命运时，才能实现真正的稳定。	Stability will come only when economic opportunities exist, when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families, rather than seeking their fortune in violence.
马德里 — — 2005年基督徒占绝大多数的南苏丹和以穆斯林为主的北苏丹签署的《全面和平协议 》 （ CPA）结束了当代一次最血腥的内战。	MADRID – The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that was reached in 2005 between mostly Christian southern Sudan and the country’s Muslim North, ended one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern times.
而他们会面带微笑、招手致意，并把身上碰巧带着的小礼物扔给我们－纸牌啦、口香糖啦、救急的糖果啦…在我们眼里，他们简直就是来自另一个世界的英雄 。 ”	They would smile and wave and throw us whatever gifts they happened to have – playing cards, chewing gum, lifesaver candies….For us they were like heroes from another world.”
特朗普直言自己是普京“粉丝 ” ， 他不可能将纠正这个倾斜的实力平衡作为与俄罗斯的外交“重置”的一部分 — — 更不用说作为条件了。	Trump, a vocal Putin fan, is unlikely to redress the tilting balance of power as part of, let alone as a condition for, a diplomatic “reset” with Russia.
对许多韩国年轻人来说，拜住房成本和年轻人失业率等因素所赐，如今连结婚也未必结得起，即使是大学毕业生也是如此。	For many young South Koreans, even marriage is economically unfeasible nowadays, owing to factors like high housing costs and youth unemployment, even among university graduates.
发达国家和新兴国家的道路和桥梁同样需要修缮，供水系统老化或能力不足，并因电网负担过重导致大面积停电。	In advanced and emerging economies alike, roads and bridges need repair, water systems are aging or inadequate, and power grids are overburdened, leading to blackouts.
即使妇女从事与男性同样或价值等价的岗位，平均而言她们的薪酬也比男性更少（尽管薪酬差距大小在世界各地大相径庭 ） 。	Even when women perform the same or equal-value jobs as men, they are paid less, on average (although the size of the pay gap varies considerably around the world).
但是，奇怪的是，在八个大目标中，只有最后一个是关于“全球合作 ” ， 即发达国家可以和应该怎么做的。	But, oddly, of the eight goals, only the last one deals with “global partnership,” or what rich countries can and should do.
这反过来意味着“不仅参于国与国之间层面（的互动 ） ” ，还要与“我们传统外交渠道之外的参与者们合作 。 ”	That, in turn, requires “not just engaging state to state,” but also working “with players and actors outside of the traditional [channels] we’ve engaged in.”
特朗普和习近平必须找到办法化解朝鲜半岛的危机 — — 或者在外交努力失败、战争爆发的情况下，做好后果管理。	Trump and Xi must find a way to defuse the looming crisis on the Korean Peninsula – or manage the consequences should diplomacy fail and war erupt.
中国担心“萨德”的X波段雷达将破坏中国的二次核打击能力，而且韩国的“萨德”系统还会与美国和日本的相关设备连为一体，从而构建了一个全面覆盖东北亚的反导网络。	Chinese leaders worry that THAAD’s X-band radar will negate China’s second-strike nuclear capacity, and that the system could be integrated with US and Japanese facilities to create a web covering all of Northeast Asia.
宗教的回归政治以及大体上的回归民众的生活是对在民主体制下颁布的法律的规定以及由此而来的公民的自由权的一个严正的挑战。	The return of religion to politics – and to public life in general – is a serious challenge to the rule of democratically enacted law and the civil liberties that go with it.
他们所需要的很多工具十分基本 — — 只要想种更多粮食、挣更多收入就必须用到这些工具：融资渠道、改良的种子、肥料、培训和出售庄稼的市场。	Many of the tools they’ll need are quite basic – things that they need anyway to grow more food and earn more income: access to financing, better seeds, fertilizer, training, and markets where they can sell what they grow.
如果改革成行，埃尔多安获得的权力甚至将超过备受尊敬的现代土耳其“之父”穆斯塔法·凯末尔·阿塔图尔克（Mustafa KemalAtatürk ） 。	If the reform passes, Erdoğan will acquire powers exceeding even those held by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the venerated “father” of modern Turkey.
发达经济体的私人和公共债务依旧高企并且还在上升 — — 从根本上说这是不可持续的，特别是在欧元区和日本。	Private and public debts in advanced economies are still high and rising – and are potentially unsustainable, especially in the eurozone and Japan.
到目前为止，正式被中国列入“核心利益”的包括台湾、西藏和新疆。 “核心利益”一词意味着国家主权和领土完整，中国在这方面绝不会让步。	So far, China has formally referred to Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang province as “core interests,” a phrase that connotes an assertion of national sovereignty and territorial integrity that will brook no compromise.
在先进的20国集团经济体中，相比于2015年的1.7 % ， 2017年平均实际工资仅增长0.4 % 。	In the advanced G20 economies, average real wages grew by a mere 0.4% in 2017, compared to 1.7% growth in 2015.
但是，首先，我们必须预计相关融资要求 — — 融资要求很快就会超过政府和国际赞助者当前的能力；同时，我们还必须现在就采取行动激活可靠地新融资源。	But, first, they must anticipate the associated financing requirements, which will soon surpass the current capacities of governments and international donors, and take action now to activate new, reliable sources of financing.
虽然如此，在过去几年里，中国城市抗议活动的数量还是大幅增加，而且据警方的报告称，它们的规模更大也更有组织了。	Protest in China has spun upward dramatically in recent years, in numbers, scale, and organization.
这个国家在过去四年的经济增长率平均达到5.5 % ， 并且推动了周边国家经济的发展，似乎证明了在非洲即便没有矿物或化石资源同样也可以取得经济的强劲增长。	The country’s economic expansion, which averaged 5.5% in the last four years and fuelled the progress of neighboring economies, appeared to prove that vigorous growth is possible in Africa even without mineral or fossil resources.
欧盟委员会目前正在研究使监督重点扩大到财政政策之外，这样我们就能够识别因宏观经济的不平衡或竞争力的改变而产生的风险，并在问题变得棘手之前，就开始解决它们。	The European Commission is now working on extending the focus of surveillance beyond fiscal policy so that we can identify risks stemming from macroeconomic imbalances or changes in competitiveness and address them before they become entrenched.
马克思的社会主义虽已市场饱和，但他有一个主张还是对的：全球化、无约束的金融资本主义、收入和财富由劳动向资本转移，会导致资本主义的自我毁灭。	Karl Marx oversold socialism, but he was right in claiming that globalization, unfettered financial capitalism, and redistribution of income and wealth from labor to capital could lead capitalism to self-destruct.
中国在过去几十年内的高GDP增长无疑使数亿中国人的收入得到了提高，而其中受益最大的则是那些居住在城市或是城郊区域的人们。	China’s high rate of GDP growth over the past decade has, of course, raised the real incomes of hundreds of millions of Chinese, particularly those living in or near urban areas.
在美国，国会预算办公室（CBO）估算联邦政府债务在过去十年翻了一番，从占GDP的36%增加到74 % 。	In the United States, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal government debt doubled over the past decade, from 36% of GDP to 74% of GDP.
这是因为，尽管政府显然仍旧集权于党，但政权仍可能解体甚至崩溃，如果食物短缺问题解决不好且其他权力结构决定与金家决裂的话。	For, although government is now clearly centered on the party, the regime could yet unravel, and perhaps collapse, if the food shortage is not resolved and other power structures decide to step into the breach.
俄国以外的欧洲应该感谢上帝，因为后者安排能源丰富的俄罗斯与它为邻；而俄国也应为拥有这样一批富有的主顾而心存感激。	Non-Russian Europe should thank the Almighty for the presence of energy-rich Russia at its borders, while Russia should be thankful for having such wealthy customers.
尽管美韩两国依然保持着密切联系，但朝鲜极有可能一直在试图通过对双方做出不同表述而在这两个盟国之间制造紧张。	But while the US and South Korea have remained in close contact, North Korea has most likely been trying to create tensions between the two allies by telling them each slightly different things.
巴勒斯坦人确实已被激怒，但激怒他们的恰恰是以色列的行为 — — 占领导致巴勒斯坦民众权利遭受到永久性的破坏。	Palestinians are indeed being provoked, but by Israeli actions – beginning with the perpetual encroachment on their rights that occupation entails.
我们决不能低估我们在这方面所遇到的挑战，特别是考虑到我们在无法避免新一轮升级或更多挫折的情况下面临多重危机的状况 — — 包括东乌克兰、叙利亚、利比亚等等。	Only one thing is certain: If we don’t try, peace in Europe and beyond will be tenuous. So we should heed the lesson of détente: however deep the rifts, we must try to build bridges.
此后，中国的崛起证明了国家领导战略总是会失败的看法是错误的，而全球金融危机则暴露了监管不充分的市场的缺陷。	Since then, the rise of China has belied the view that a state-led strategy will always fail, and the global financial crisis exposed the perils of inadequately regulated markets.
强调市场准入和透明度的《能源宪章》固然值得喝彩，但在危机到来时却还远远不够，我们的市场还没有成熟到可以自由地应对由特定事件所引发的破坏。	The Energy Charter, which emphasizes market access and transparency, is a laudable effort but it is not sufficient for those moments of crisis; our markets are not yet well enough equipped to deal with event-driven disruptions.
但我的最近经验突显出另一种危险：有偏见的新闻，即策略性地编辑新闻，从而支持记者、编辑或节目制作者的观点。	But my recent experience highlighted another danger: biased news, in which strategic edits surreptitiously advance the views of a journalist, editor, or broadcaster.
一方面，阿拉伯国家的国王和总统们缺乏魅力，看起来没有政治能力，而且很少发表中东民众所关心的“国家大事”的言论。	On the one hand, Arab kings and presidents lack charisma, seem politically impotent and are rarely, if ever, on message with respect to the “big issue” concerns of the peoples of the Middle East.
此外，外交关系委员会的斯太尔和本杰明·德拉·罗卡研究发现，钢铁关税所带来的成本增加已经威胁到多达4万个美国汽车行业的工作机会。	Moreover, Benn Steil and Benjamin Della Rocca of the Council on Foreign Relations find that cost increases resulting from the steel tariffs have already put as many as 40,000 US auto industry jobs at risk.
否则，此次会议将作为又一次毫无意义的聚会而被载入史册 — — 任凭数千万人在世界最致命传染病的魔掌中忍受痛苦。	Otherwise, the event will be remembered as yet another meaningless gathering – one that left tens of millions to suffer in the clutches of the world’s deadliest infection.
由于机构投资者应资产价格和资产收益率的国际差异而动，美国资产价格大跌将投射到其他发达国家资产价格上，使它们也发生类似的跌幅。	Because institutional investors respond to international differences in asset prices and asset yields, the large declines in US asset prices would be mirrored by similar declines in asset prices in other developed countries.
她最近吹嘘说伦敦是世界金融之都，却并未意识到这主要是由于外国银行聘用外国工作人员（所谓“世界公民 ” ） 来为包括欧盟在内的国际市场服务而构建的。	She recently boasted that London is the world’s financial capital, without acknowledging that this is thanks mostly to foreign banks that employ foreign staff (those “citizens of the world”) to serve international markets, including the EU’s.
事实上，科塔的补习班只是一个更大的问题的症候。 该市高级官员、区税务官拉维·库马尔·苏尔珀尔（Ravi Kumar Surpur）在一封回应最近的死亡事件的充满感情色彩的信中提到了这一问题。	In fact, Kota’s coaching institutes are a symptom of a larger problem, hinted at by the city’s senior administrator, District Collector Ravi Kumar Surpur, in an emotional letter he wrote in response to the latest deaths.
像天气衍生品这样的金融产品 — — 为收成、中小企业活力和世界最贫困群体提供保险 — — 也有很大的潜力可挖。	Financial products like weather derivatives – which insure the harvests and enterprises of SMEs and some of the world’s poorest people – also have potential.
小布什很清楚该行业没有达到法律要求，世贸组织也将裁定该措施不符合美国的条约义务，因此这笔关税必须取消。	Bush was well aware that the industry failed to meet the legal requirements, that the World Trade Organization would rule the measure inconsistent with America’s treaty obligations, and thus that the tariffs would have to be rescinded.
民主之路从来都是荆棘遍地 — — 这点从欧洲持续一个世纪的变革以及美国废除奴隶制并赋予黑人政治权利时所面对的困难可知一二。	The road to democracy has always been rocky – look at a century of upheavals in Europe and the difficulties the US faced when dealing with slavery and the rights of its black population.
但是，正如英国首相卡梅伦最近所指出的，欧洲之链的断环极有可能不出现在最弱的一环，而出现在最不理智的一环。	But, as British Prime Minister David Cameron has now demonstrated, the European chain is most likely to break not at its weakest link, but at its most irrational.
正如美国前总统约翰·F·肯尼迪（John F. Kennedy）在1963年10月一次提议降低企业和个人税率的演讲中所说的那样 ： “ 潮水一涨，万帆皆高 ” 。	As former US President John F. Kennedy famously said in an October 1963 speech in which he promoted his proposed corporate and personal tax reductions, “a rising tide lifts all boats.”
尽管金融市场将在卢布汇率进入新均衡时平静下来，但俄罗斯经济将继续萎靡，迫使俄罗斯领导人作出艰难抉择。	Though financial markets will calm down when the ruble’s exchange rate settles into its new equilibrium, Russia’s economy will remain weak, forcing the country’s leaders to make tough choices.
在苏格兰的刺激下，少数国家现在组成了福祉经济联盟（Wellbeing Economy Alliance ） 。	Spurred on by Scotland, a small group of countries has now formed the Wellbeing Economy Alliance.
英国并未采用欧元，因此保留了自主设定利率的权利；但融入欧洲单一市场在经济发展和就业领域创造了显而易见的机会。	Because it has not adopted the euro, the UK has retained the autonomy to set interest rates; but integration into Europe’s single market has yielded clear gains in terms of growth and employment.
阿拉伯世界的动乱表明，在中东，没有哪个政权是牢不可破的；除非伊朗领导层是瞎子，否则不会看不到这一点。	Upheavals in the Arab world suggest that no regime in the Middle East is entrenched; Iran’s leaders would have to be blind not to have taken note.
毕竟，它进行了全面的三年一度的消费者财务状况调查（SCF ） ， 这个调查详细的评估了财富和资产负债表对广大美国消费者行为的塑造作用。	After all, it conducts a comprehensive triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which provides a detailed assessment of the role that wealth and balance sheets play in shaping the behavior of a broad cross-section of American consumers.
回顾美国介入该地区60年的历程，人们可以清楚的看到，美国要想使当地的各种势力达成共识需要两个背景条件。	Looking back at 60 years of American involvement in the region, one can discern two scenarios in which the United States can bring the local players to an agreement.
1981年的立法不是真正的税收改革，而只是匆忙推出、协调拙劣、财政上极不负责任的疯狂的公司和个人所得税减税政策。	The 1981 legislation was not true tax reform, but a rushed and poorly coordinated frenzy of fiscally irresponsible cuts to both corporate and personal income taxes.
而随着埃及需要大笔的经济援助来弥补其“2月革命”所造成的损失，新领导人更加不可能激怒沙特，因为在后者看来，伊朗（而非以色列）才是对区域稳定的最大威胁。	And, with Egypt in need of massive financial aid to offset the economic losses caused by its February revolution, its leaders can ill afford to alienate the Saudis, who view Iran, not Israel, as the gravest threat to regional stability.
从男性的角度看，求助于外来的警察或司法力量意味着没有能力独立作战 — — 这等同于承认失败并接受象征性的阉割。	From the male point of view, resorting to outside police or judicial intervention would signify an inability to fight one’s own battles – an admission of defeat and a symbolic castration.
我们可以用平均工资估算人们花在在线使用免费数字产品的时间的价值，或者，我们可以调整通讯服务产出以估计互联网流量的迅速增长。	We can use average wages to estimate the value of the time people spend online using free digital products, or we can adjust telecommunication services output to account for the rapid growth in Internet traffic.
该国领导人战略思维的缺失以及对全球舆论的漠不关心不但引发了民众内部不断累积的失望情绪，而更危险的，则是一再恶化的国际孤立状况。	Its leaders’ apparent inability to think in strategic terms, and their indifference to the tribunal of global public opinion, is resulting in growing frustration among its citizens and, what may be more dangerous, deepening international isolation.
如果现在规劝小泉根康弘停止参拜靖国神社的中曾来回答麻生太郎，他可以简单地发挥一下这个类比：继续吸小泉的二手烟不符合日本的国家利益。	If Nakasone, who now urges Koizumi to stop the Yasukuni pilgrimage, were to respond to Aso, he might simply extend the analogy: it is not in Japan’s national interest to continue to inhale Koizumi’s second-hand smoke.
但布什有关美国无法对全球变暖采取任何措施的说法根本站不住脚：其他生活水平与美国近似的发达国家，其单位美元国内生产总值所导致的排放却只占美国的一小部分。	But claims by Bush that America cannot afford to do anything about global warming ring hollow: other advanced industrial countries with comparable standards of living emit only a fraction of what the US emits per dollar of GDP.
那么为什么一个我们的政治领袖 — — 以及许多经济学家 — — 声称会让所有人过得更好的事物会遭到如此唾骂？	How can something that our political leaders – and many an economist – said would make everyone better off be so reviled?
结果，欧元区作为一个整体今年将有近2600亿美元的盈余，这将带来可以与过去十年的中国直接比较的新的全球失衡。	As a result, the eurozone as a whole will produce a surplus close to $260 billion this year, which represents a new global imbalance that is more directly comparable to China’s in the past decade.
从推特喷子在选民中播下不和的种子，到克林姆林宫对极端团体的所谓支持，俄罗斯发动的宣传攻势正在破坏民众对民主执政的信任。	From Twitter trolls sowing discord among voters, to the Kremlin’s alleged support for extremist groups, Russian propaganda is undermining trust in democratic governance.
但老布什深思熟虑地选择不去羞辱苏联，也不幸灾乐祸 ： “ 我不会在柏林墙上手舞足蹈 ， ” 这就是他的反应 — — 堪称领袖心理智慧的样板。	But Bush had made a deliberate choice not to humiliate the Soviets or gloat: “I won’t beat on my chest and dance on the wall,” was his response – a model of emotional intelligence in a leader.
根据中国国家统计局公布的资料，资源丰富的山西省遭遇了经济下滑，但是位于西南部的重庆市和贵州省的经济却增长迅速，生机勃勃。	According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the resource-rich province of Shanxi has suffered an economic slowdown, but the southwestern provinces of Chongqing and Guizhou have experienced vibrant growth.
这起诉讼是由捷克共和国俄斯特拉法市18个罗姆孩子提起的。 这些孩子因为“智力缺陷”而被分配去特殊的补习学校。	The case was brought by 18 Roma children from the city of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who had been assigned to special remedial schools for the “mentally deficient.”
东盟部长会议自召开45年里来首次无法在联合公报上达成共识，表面上是因为现任东盟主席国柬埔寨不希望在公报中谈及南中国海的双边争端。	For the first time in 45 years, the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) failed to agree to a joint communiqué, ostensibly because ASEAN’s current chair, Cambodia, did not want the communiqué to refer to bilateral disputes in the South China Sea.
中国官员对所有的不法行为都予以否认，直到2013年6月美国总统奥巴马和习近平在加州会面时向后者出示了美国通过自身网络间谍获取的详细证据。	Chinese officials denied all wrongdoing until President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping met in California in June 2013. Obama showed Xi detailed proof that the US had obtained through its own cyber espionage.
在印度，最能和美国黑人的地位相类比的是贱民-即以前所谓的“最底层不可接触的贱民 ” ， 他们是数千年来遭受屈辱的歧视和压迫的被剥夺种姓的阶层。	The closest Indian analogy to the position of black Americans is that of the Dalits – formerly called “Untouchables,” the outcastes who for millennia suffered humiliating discrimination and oppression.
当足球比赛¾至少是那些必须决出胜负的比赛¾在120分钟内踢成平局的时候，必须依靠互罚点球来决定胜负，本届世界杯让我们见识了点球大战的戏剧性。	When football matches – at least those that must produce a winner – end in a draw, a penalty shoot-out must resolve the matter, as this World Cup has demonstrated so dramatically.
日本已经决定向乌克兰提供1,500亿日元的经济援助，这是到目前为止包括美国在内的最大一笔单国援助承诺。	Already, Japan has decided to provide ¥150 billion ($1.5 billion) in economic aid for Ukraine, the largest pledge by any individual country, including the US, thus far.
而即便是我们这些前来访问的外国人 — — 全部恭敬地身着毛式服装和帽子 — — 都被要求定期参加“学习班 ” ， 以便用“四人帮”编写的那些无产阶级政治小册子来“净化”我们的资产阶级思想。	Even we visiting foreigners – all dutifully clad in blue Mao suits and caps – were expected to attend regular political “study sessions” to purify our bourgeois minds with proletarian tracts written by the Gang of Four.
毕竟，许多银行经营所处的竞争性环境中发生的变化 — — 新支付系统、点对点（peer-to-peer）贷款、影子银行和其他变化 — — 需要仔细的分析和思考。	After all, many changes in the competitive environment within which banks operate – new payment systems, peer-to-peer lenders, shadow banks, and the rest – require careful analysis and thought.
但如何对待移民，是否允许他们保留自己挣来的成果，以及他们对社会和经济发展做出了什么贡献则是所有人的问题。	But how migrants are treated, whether they are allowed to keep what they earn, and what they contribute to social and economic development are issues that matter to everyone.
里德尔认为 ， “ 认为在忽视为[基地组织]提供土壤的总体圣战环境的同时能够以某种方式选择性解决基地组织问题的观念无论在过去和将来都不会取得成功 。 ”	“The notion that you can somehow selectively resolve the Al Qaeda problem while ignoring the larger jihadist sea in which [Al Qaeda] swims has failed in the past and will fail in the future,” Riedel argues.
公私合作的新诉求不仅可能重写发展经济学，还可能重塑整个富国与穷国的关系 — — 尽管未必朝积极的方向发展。	PPPs’ new appeal may redefine not just development economics, but also the overall relationship between rich and poor countries – though not necessarily for the better.
印度29个邦中的四个（比哈尔、古吉拉特、曼尼普尔和那加兰）以及一个直辖区（拉克沙威或拉克代夫群岛）目前都在尝试强制性禁酒令。	Four out of 29 Indian states (Bihar, Gujarat, Manipur, and Nagaland) and one union territory (Lakshadweep or the Laccadive Islands) are currently attempting to enforce total prohibition.
利润率低、负债少的银行属于光脚的不怕穿鞋的那一类，它们会倾向于赌博 — — 在存款保险和“太大而不能倒”的政策下，这一倾向愈加明显。	A bank with thin margins and limited liability does not have much to lose, and will tend to gamble – a tendency that is exacerbated by deposit insurance and too-big-to-fail policies.
1948年在联合国主持下正式成立后，当时羽翼未丰的大韩民国立即被卷入到冷战的强权政治中，并在1991年前阻碍其加入联合国。	Founded formally in 1948 under UN auspices, the then-fledgling Republic of Korea immediately became engulfed in Cold War power politics, which hampered its efforts to join the UN – a goal not achieved until 1991.
在聪明的新任首相特雷莎·梅（梅是留欧支持者）的领导下，我们所有人必须竭尽全力将我们的国家从孤立和衰退的边缘挽救回来。	All of us, led by a new and clever prime minister, Theresa May (who campaigned to stay in Europe), must do all we can to save our country from isolation and decline.
如果贸易战升级，双方都将建立系统性进口壁垒，这将助推美国的通胀压力，有可能促使美联储更快更大幅地提高利率。	An escalating trade war, with each side erecting symmetric import barriers, would fuel inflationary pressure in the US, potentially driving the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates higher and faster than it would otherwise.
虽然衡量教育方面的成效(尤其是在多种情况下)可能比较困难，同伴行动网络必须以取得成果为导向，而这意味着要对其效果进行衡量。	While gauging success in education can be difficult, especially across contexts, peer action networks must be oriented toward achieving results, and that means measuring their effectiveness.
对我和我的政府来说，眼前的主要任务 — — 更加努力地复兴日本经济 — — 与捍卫日本在全球和���、进步与繁荣事业中的先锋地位是不可分割的。	For me and my government, the main task ahead – working even harder to restore Japan’s economy – is inseparable from safeguarding our country’s position in the global vanguard of peace, progress, and prosperity.
我们真心希望更多的国家政府能仿效加纳的榜样, 更多像法国这样的盟国能增加它们的支持，而新的总干事能教科文组织在非洲的使命列为优先事务，所有这一切都将比以往任何时候更为重要。	We must hope that more governments follow Ghana’s example, that more allies like France increase their support, and that the new director general will place a high priority on UNESCO’s missions in Africa, which are more critical than ever.
2011年，我们可能目睹上述意愿是否会引导中国领导人重新评价自己的外交政策，这样的外交政策导致中国在亚洲的可靠盟友只剩下腐败并陷入经济困境的缅甸和北朝鲜。	In 2011 we may begin to see whether those incentives lead China’s rulers to re-appraise their diplomatic conduct, which has left them with only the corrupt, basket case economies of Burma and North Korea as reliable friends in Asia.
查韦斯对第三条导论饶有兴趣 — — 即介于美国式资本主义和国家社会主义之间的生活方式，比布莱尔对此产生兴趣早了好几年。	Hugo Chávez was very interested in the Third Way – a modus vivendi between American-style capitalism and state socialism – as had been Tony Blair a few years earlier.
但是，正如国际货币基金组织在拉脱维亚和乌克兰的项目所表明的那样 ， “ 奥巴马国际货币基金组织”和“布什国际货币基金组织”间的主要区别，不值一提。	But, as the IMF programs for Latvia and Ukraine suggest, the main difference may only be a smile.
2017年，来自中国的投资达到了3,100万美元；到2018年4月，预计将增加95亿美元，为菲律宾创造10,800个旅游业、农业和电子商务就业岗位。	In 2017, investments from China reached $31 million; by April 2018, an additional $9.5 billion was expected, creating 10,800 jobs for Filipinos in tourism, agriculture, and e-commerce.
但有一件事是确定无疑的，就是虽然英国选民单方面作出了自己的决定，但保持与英国的紧密联系依然符合欧盟的最佳利益。	One thing we can know for sure, however, is that it is in the EU’s best interest to maintain strong ties with the UK, despite the fact that British voters made their decision unilaterally.
通过这个手段，我们认识到成人消化牛奶的能力其实是在近1万年内的进化成果 — — 而且还发生了多次进化 — — 并源自于那些懂得驯养绵羊，山羊和牛的文明。	From this approach, we have learned, for example, that the ability to digest milk as adults evolved within the last 10,000 years – and several times – in cultures that domesticated sheep, goats, or cattle.
如此大规模不但对全球经济日益重要，也日益有利于制衡中国在亚洲的影响力以及管理气候变化、公共卫生和网络安全等全球性问题。	Its sheer scale will be increasingly important not only to the global economy, but also to balancing China’s influence in Asia and managing global issues such as climate change, public health, and cyber security.
在田间地头和仓储环境中使用化学品所导致的有毒物质积累可能导致我们的自然环境 — — 即土壤、水和空气质量的持续下降。	The accumulation of toxic substances from chemicals applied both in the field and in storage also contributes to the continuous decline in the quality of our natural environment – namely, our soil, water, and air.
这些因素，再加上笃信某个政治立场的自以为是，让印度人民党网络喷子这样的社交媒体用户敢于将脑子里的内容说出来。	These factors, together with the self-righteousness of true believers in a political cause, embolden social-media users like the BJP’s trolls to say anything that crosses their minds.
出于这一原因，中国正试图以经济和军事援助为杠杆，与甚至在过去有过军事对抗的国家改善关系。 其中最明显的莫过于越南和菲律宾。	For this reason, China is attempting to use economic and military aid as leverage to improve relations even with countries with which it has had military confrontations with in the past, most prominently Vietnam and the Philippines.
在股票相对表现欠佳的1998-2008年之前是股票表现相对较好的1978-1988年和1988-1998年两个时期。 而且当时看来它们之后的十年这种好的趋势很可能会持续。	Periods like 1998-2008, in which stocks do relatively badly, are preceded by periods – like 1978-1988 and 1988-1998 – in which they do relatively well, and are in all likelihood followed by similar periods.
携带纸币进出一个国家对于避税者和罪犯来说代价高昂；接受虚拟货币的日本有可能成为瑞士式的避税港 — — 银行保密法让位给了技术。	Carrying paper currency in and out of a country is a major cost for tax evaders and criminals; by embracing virtual currencies, Japan risks becoming a Switzerland-like tax haven – with the bank secrecy laws baked into the technology.
如果穆巴拉克政权在政治性伊斯兰教的旗帜下垮台，穆斯林原教旨主义者将处于更加有利的位置，对这次革命和国家获得控制权，更加地排外。	If the Mubarak regime had fallen under the banner of political Islam, Muslim fundamentalists would have been in a much better position to advance more exclusivist claims over the revolution and the country.
香港的例子表明，中国必须迫使台湾放弃民主和法治 — — 或两者都放弃 — — 然后再欢迎它的“反叛的省”回到怀抱。	What the example of Hong Kong suggests is that China would have to force Taiwan to give up democracy and the rule of law – or embrace both itself – before it could welcome its “renegade province” back into the fold.
但同样应该注意的是2014年中国二氧化碳排放量大幅下降，这也许是第一个实在的证据证明中国正在这方面取得进步。	But it must also be noted that China’s carbon dioxide emissions declined notably in 2014, offering what is perhaps the first tangible evidence that the country is making some progress on this front.
他们梦想在欧洲过上安全和有希望的日子，并为了实现这一梦想不辞千辛万苦 — — 甚至冒着生命危险横渡地中海。	They dream of a life of security and opportunity in Europe, and are willing to go to great lengths to obtain it – even embarking on a life-threatening journey across the Mediterranean Sea.
人们计划在哥伦比亚建设七座联合军事设施，并且对垄断作物熏蒸市场的美国私人承包商的支持很可能也不会动摇。	In Colombia, seven new joint military installations are planned, and support for US private contractors who have cornered the market in crop fumigation presumably will not be interrupted.
1996年，日本公共债务/GDP之比达到了80 % ， 许多日本经济学家和官员担心危机随时可能爆发。	In 1996, when Japan’s public debt/GDP ratio reached 80%, many Japanese economists and officials worried about a looming crisis.
在欧洲，增长有望在今年回归，尽管速度将非常缓慢，国际货币基金组织（IMF）的产出增长预测是1 % 。	In Europe, growth appears set to return this year, though at a truly anemic rate, with the International Monetary Fund projecting a 1% annual increase in output.
如果形势继续按照这个节奏发展下去，我们在英国政客身上所看到的革命热情将在“硬退欧”完成之前反噬其身。	If developments continue at this pace, the revolutionary zeal we see among British politicians may burn itself out before “hard Brexit” is consummated.
这要求阿什顿女士在和俄罗斯以及那些将其国有能源公司的商业利益凌驾于欧盟利益的成员国打交道时，立场要坚定。	Lady Ashton will need to be firm in dealing with Russia and with member states who subordinate Europe to the commercial interests of their national energy companies.
2000—2007年间，美国累计经常项目赤字约为5.5万亿美元，基本上正好抵消掉中国和日本的外汇储备增��。	From 2000 to 2007, the US ran a cumulative current-account deficit of roughly $5.5 trillion, with nearly symmetrical offsetting increases in reserves in China and Japan.
尽管1978年的时候中国仅有186份报纸、少数杂志和几个广播电台，如今却大约有2,200份报纸，9,000份杂志，1,000个电台和420个电视台，外加一个正在迅速庞大的有线电视网。	Whereas in 1978 there were only 186 newspapers and a handful of magazines and broadcast outlets, today China has roughly 2,200 newspapers, 9,000 magazines, 1,000 radio stations, and 420 TV stations, plus a growing proliferation of cable TV outlets.
然而当“石油顶峰论”者们对自己的观点自信满满之时，他们却没有考虑到任何目前或者未来在技术上提高资源量的技术可能性。	While peak oil theorists have strong views about that, they do not allow for all the current and future technological possibilities that might increase resources.
国际社会对残酷镇压霍姆斯起义不闻不问的态度助长了阿萨德及其同伙的气焰，他们继续残酷惩罚起义幸存者，以警告其他地方的反对派人士。	Assad and his cohorts are encouraged by the world’s failure to respond effectively to their brutal suppression of the revolt in Homs, and have proceeded to inflict vicious punishment on its survivors as a warning to opponents elsewhere.
似是而非的是，在掌控如此重要的权力如此之久以后，谁也说不清布莱尔会对英国国内留下什么影响，如果有影响的话。	The paradox is that, for a man who wielded so much power for so long, it is unclear what domestic legacy, if any, Blair will leave.
出口活动需要的具体规则、基础设施、技能和技术掌握往往与创造当地大部分就业机会的非贸易活动相比有着显著的区别。	The specific rules, infrastructure, skills, and technological mastery that export activities require tend to be different from those needed for the non-tradable activities that usually generate the bulk of a place’s employment.
工业革命的发生相对较为缓慢，就像海洋中的长波；它始于18世纪80年代，但其影响直到19世纪三四十年代才被真正感到。	The Industrial Revolution occurred relatively slowly, like long waves in the ocean; though it began in the 1780s, its impact was not really felt until the 1830s and 1840s.
相反，该党要求建立一个叫做帕达尼亚（Padania）的新国家，将繁荣的北方地区与罗马和南方的腐败和贫困分离。	Instead, the party demanded the creation of a new country called Padania that would separate the prosperous northern regions from the corruption and poverty of Rome and points south.
这是欧洲研究机构和非政府组织联合体土地矩阵合伙组织（Land Matrix Partnership）去年题为《南半球跨国农用土地交易 》 （ Transnational Land Deals for Agriculture in the Global South）的报告中提出的问题。	That question is raised in Transnational Land Deals for Agriculture in the Global South, a report issued last year by the Land Matrix Partnership, a consortium of European research institutes and nongovernmental organizations.
她的处境比较艰难，可以预料她将经常受到欧盟委员会主席若泽·曼努埃尔·巴罗佐的排挤，因为后者是这次职位分蛋糕的最大赢家。	She has a difficult hand to play, and can expect her elbow to be nudged regularly by EU Commission President José Manuel Barroso, who was the big winner in the carve-up of jobs.
激进狭隘（militant parochialism）在大西洋两岸迅速崛起的现象受到了全方位的研究：精神角度、文化角度、人类学角度、审美角度，当然还有身份政治角度。	The rise of militant parochialism on both sides of the Atlantic is being investigated from every angle imaginable: psychoanalytically, culturally, anthropologically, aesthetically, and of course in terms of identity politics.
一些国家不会因想象民族尊严受到侵害而感到威胁 — — 处于种种历史原因，它们认为自己高其他民族一等。	Some nations do not feel threatened by imaginary insults to national dignity – for various historical reasons, they believe themselves to be superior to others.
但梅制造“霍布森抉择”的努力存在一个致命的缺陷：那就是几乎没有人相信她胆敢将混乱强加给英国的企业和选民。	But May’s effort to present a Hobson’s Choice suffers a fatal flaw: almost nobody believes that she would dare to inflict chaos on British businesses and voters.
竞争力低下也不是理由，因为近几年来希腊实际（经通胀调整的）工资成本的降幅比任何其他欧元区国家（爱尔兰除外）都要大。	Low competitiveness, too, is not an explanation, as real (inflation-adjusted) wage costs have declined by more in Greece in recent years than in any other eurozone country, with the exception of Ireland.
这一复杂性意味着任何对我们的政治经济的调整都应该基于可靠的社会科学，并由真正为人民利益服务的民选领导人来引导。	This complexity implies that any adjustments to our political economy should be based on sound social science and directed by elected leaders who are genuinely acting in the interest of the people.
任何太大或内部关系太紧密的，或可能很快变成那样的金融机构都会失败，因此金融机构必须得到密切管制，对风险和资本充足率的进行实时监管，或将他们分成较小的公司。	Any financial institution that is too big or too interconnected to fail, or could quickly become so, must be closely regulated and monitored for risk and capital adequacy in real time, or be broken up into smaller firms.
而该现象将阻碍经济的发展，也令中国国内问题的有效治理更加复杂化，其中包括巨大的贫富收入差距以及缺乏能够疏导民众愤怒并传达需求的政治体制。	This will cause economic growth to slacken, complicating effective management of China’s domestic problems, which range from deep income disparities to the lack of political institutions capable of channeling popular grievances and demands.
这意味着任何引起严重反对的退欧计划 — — 不管是来自强硬民族主义者还是来自亲欧保守党 — — 都可以用来触发新的公投。	This means that any Brexit plan that arouses serious opposition, either from hardline nationalists or from pro-European Tories, could be used to trigger a new referendum.
因此我竭尽全力说服我在国会的共和党朋友，减少来自税收开支的收入损失着实是降低政府支出的好办法，尽管这一赤字减少体现在预算的收入端。	So I do my best to persuade my Republican friends in Congress that reducing the revenue loss from tax expenditures is really a way to cut government spending even though the deficit reduction appears on the revenue side of the budget.
治理委员会的许多人都反对这种幼稚的暗号游戏，因为一旦该委员会需要采取行动这种做法将会极大限制其自由。	Many on the Governing Council object to this childish game of code words, because it eliminates their freedom of action once the Council commits itself to a course of action.
政府行政机关所遵守的决策程序是，相关部门和机构确定给定情景的风险和收益，形成一份选项有限的政策选择清单呈给总统以供选择。	The executive branch adheres to a decision-making process whereby relevant departments and agencies determine the risks and rewards of given scenarios, and then furnish the president with a limited menu of policy options from which to choose.
这种调整负担的转变将惩罚那些造成灾难的人，刺激总需求，并减少令绝大多数民众怨声载道的不平等增加状况。	This shift in the burden of adjustment would have imposed losses on the people who were responsible for the calamity, stimulated aggregate demand, and diminished the rising inequality that was demoralizing the vast majority of people.
尽管这一指标在2005年的头三个季度稍微有所恶化，但是在最后一个季度中再次上升。 这表明，繁荣在延续。	While Ifo`s World Economic Climate indicator, generated from quarterly surveys of 1,200 experts in 90 countries, worsened slightly during the first three quarters of 2005, it rose again in the last quarter, indicating a continuation of the boom.
阿富汗和邻近的巴基斯坦省份都是贫穷地区，有着大面积��业、大量年轻人口、连年干旱、蔓延的饥荒和普遍的经济弱势群体。	Both Afghanistan and the neighboring provinces of Pakistan are impoverished regions, with vast unemployment, bulging youth populations, prolonged droughts, widespread hunger, and pervasive economic deprivation.
由此带来的新投资机会的大量涌现抑制了闲置资本和高风险债务带来的风险，同时也推动了投资效率和劳动生产率的提高。	The resulting surge of new investment opportunities diminished the risks posed by idle capital and risky debt, while driving increases in investment efficiency and labor productivity.
幸运的是，中国城市规划者还有很大的空间放松土地供给和容积率（楼面总面积与建筑用地面积之比）方面的限制。	Fortunately, there is scope for China’s urban planners to relax restrictions on the supply of land and on the floor area ratio (the ratio of gross floor area to the size of the lot on which the building stands).
在这即将迎来突破的时刻，包括美国在内的若干国家政府与企业和其他合作伙伴一道，本月在联合国宣布了启动全新“可持续发展全球伙伴关系”计划。	With this breakthrough in sight, several governments, including that of the United States, as well as businesses and other partners, have announced plans to launch a new “Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data” at the UN this month.
比如，其搁置两位军衔更高的将领，任命毕平·拉瓦特（Bipin Rawat）中将为陆军参谋长，完全无视历史悠久的晋升传统。	For example, in appointing Lieutenant General Bipin Rawat as Chief of Army Staff, the government bypassed two higher-ranking generals, flouting time-honored principles of seniority.
由于这些国家无法得到国际贷款，无法发行公债并得到外国的直接投资，过去谈到的那些基建项目如今年都被搁置下来，这也就让众多的发展中国家的政治与经济稳定受到威胁。	As access to international bank loans, bond flotations, and foreign direct investment is lost, infrastructure projects talked about in the past are now being shelved, threatening the political and economic stability of dozens of developing countries.
事实上，欧洲央行可能把少数出售了信用违约互换的银行的利益置于优先于希腊、欧洲纳税人以及审慎债权人和保险购买者的利益的地位。	In fact, the ECB may be putting the interests of the few banks that have written credit-default swaps before those of Greece, Europe’s taxpayers, and creditors who acted prudently and bought insurance.
穆罕默德·穆尔西总统的法律顾问穆罕默德·福阿德·贾杜拉最近表示，埃及新上任的伊斯兰领导人或许想要恢复对西奈半岛的“完全主权 ” 。	Egypt’s new Islamist leaders may want to restore “full sovereignty” over the peninsula, as President Mohamed Morsi’s legal adviser, Mohamed Fouad Gadalla, recently noted.
在那十年的中段，鉴于联邦基金利率已于1995年达到顶峰，美联储开始逐步收紧政策 — — 也跟今天一样。	In the middle of that decade, the US Federal Reserve began gradually tightening its policy – much as it is doing today – with the federal funds rate peaking in 1995.
出于上述原因，当欧洲经济区在1994年最初成立时，其目的仅仅是作为计划成为欧盟成员、但还没有准备好最终加入的奥地利、瑞典、芬兰和挪威等国的临时过渡性制度。	For these reasons, when the EEA was established in 1994, it was intended only as a temporary transitional arrangement for countries – such as Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway – which planned to become EU members, but were not ready to join.
当然“rumochnaia”与尼古拉·果戈理没有什么共同之处，但以这位名作家命名的餐馆确实有一座冰场，每天一次，身穿果戈理服装的演员在这里进行冰上演出。	Of course “rumochnaia” had nothing in common with Nikolai Gogol, but the establishment named after the famous writer does have a skating rink that is used once a day by a man dressed up as Gogol.
只要中国的经济继续增长，它的军事力量就很有可能加强，这将会使中国看起来对其邻国更具危险性，使美国在亚洲的事务变得更为复杂化。	As long as China’s economy does grow, its military power will likely increase, thus making China appear more dangerous to its neighbors and complicating America’s commitments in Asia.
一开始欧洲对起义漠然处之；后来随着事态逐渐深入又开始积极表态支持阿拉伯地区的民主运动，同时却对从突尼斯乘船涌来的大量难民采取了相当严厉的限制措施。	After a lukewarm reaction to the uprisings, Europe was eager to show its support for democratic movements in the region. At the same time, with boatloads of migrants arriving from Tunisia, some rather drastic measures have been adopted.
欧洲的选民似乎已经开始意识到，在目前的政策安排下，欧元毁灭的正是从前希望通过创立这一货币来实现的愿景。	The European electorate seems to have recognized that, under current arrangements, the euro is undermining the very purposes for which it was supposedly created.
但如果没有战略性政策路线图来指导进一步的金融技术（fintech）研发，这些新的“连接”模式所能提供的服务依然是有限的。	But, without a strategic policy roadmap to guide further financial-technology (fintech) development, these new “connector” models will remain limited in terms of the services they can provide.
要使融资成本下降到合理水平而不破坏中国经济重组大局，货币政策必须与设计良好、协调划一的金融改革相结合。	In order to lower funding costs to a reasonable level, without undermining China’s economic-restructuring effort, monetary policy must be combined with well-designed and concerted financial reform.
但不幸的是，近来关于欧洲的争论中正是缺乏这一点：不管反紧缩运动变得多么声势浩大，凯恩斯主义都不可能是解决单一货币债务和经济增长灾难的灵丹妙药。	This, unfortunately, is what has been lost in the debate about Europe of late: However loud and aggressive the anti-austerity movement becomes, there still will be no simple Keynesian cure for the single currency’s debt and growth woes.
这么样的资本管制如果变成现实的话，就等于判了美元这个单一货币的死刑，因为这类限制是与一个货币联盟完全不兼容的。	Such capital controls, if they ever came about, would spell the end of the dollar as a single currency, because such constraints are utterly incompatible with a monetary union.
私人部门财务收支的波动情况是：2006年存在相当于GDP的3.7%的赤字（繁荣期最高值 ） ， 2010出现了相当于GDP的6.8%左右的盈余，目前盈余约为GDP的5 % 。	The private-sector financial balance swung from a deficit of 3.7% of GDP in 2006, at the height of the boom, to a surplus of about 6.8% of GDP in 2010 and about 5% today.
要害就在这里：拖欠IMF的国家没有资格获得来自其他渠道的长期融资，包括世界银行750亿美元规模的优惠的国际发展协会（IDA）便利。	And there’s the rub: countries in arrears to the IMF are ineligible to receive long-term financing from other sources, including the World Bank’s $75 billion concessional International Development Association (IDA) facility.
在这么多国人遭受损失和明知还有200，000多人在疏散中心过着艰苦生活的条件下，人们无法像平常那样去享受生活，这就是情谊的一种美德。	One virtue of kizuna can be seen in people’s inability to enjoy themselves in their usual ways in the face of the loss of so many countrymen and the knowledge that 200,000 more are enduring harsh conditions in evacuation centers.
当 G7 部长们在本周和接下来的会议上会面时，他们将讨论的一个主题是“投资一个可以服务于每个人的增长 ” 。	When G7 ministers meet this week and next, one theme they will discuss is “investing in growth that works for everyone.”

在参议院，即使他支持美国总统布什的向伊拉克开战的选择，他却一直准备捍卫他对问题的独立判断，比如在改革竞选资金的募集和气候变化的问题上。	In the Senate, while supporting President Bush’s war of choice in Iraq, he has been prepared to stand up for his independent judgment on issues such as campaign finance reform and climate change.
埃沃之后就是Jorge “Tuto” Quoroga，他是身价百万的前IBM董事，一位精干的欧洲玻利维亚籍后裔。 他与美国共和党联系密切，而且娶了德克萨斯州一位名叫金格（Ginger）的金发女郎。	Running behind “Evo” is Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, a millionaire former IBM executive from the European-descended Bolivian elite; he is closely aligned with America’s Republican Party and is married to a Texas blonde named Ginger.
它可以从委内瑞拉的国有石油公司的支持中来获得实现所有这些活动所需的资金，执行在长期内是误导的但是在短期内很诱人的社会政策，特别是当这些政策是由古巴医生、教师和教导人员执行的时候。	It can finance all of this with the support of Venezuela’s state oil company, implementing social policies that are misguided over the long term but seductive in the short run, especially when carried out by Cuban doctors, teachers, and instructors.
被免职的前中共中央政治局委员薄熙来热衷派对的儿子薄瓜瓜在哈罗公学 — — 温斯顿·丘吉尔的母校 — — 上过学，后来去了牛津大学和哈佛大学。	Disgraced ex-Politburo member Bo Xilai’s hard-partying son, Bo Guagua, attended Harrow, Winston Churchill’s alma mater, then Oxford and Harvard.
但诺贝尔奖得主罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）指出，资本的流向出了问题，从低收入向高收入国家流动。	But as Nobel laureate Robert Lucas noted, capital has been flowing in the wrong direction, from low- to high-income countries.
其次，中国企业被鼓励“走向全球 ” ， 到海外去投资，以寻找新的市场、确保能源和原材料通道、并通过收购新技术、品牌和管理技能加强竞争力。	Second, China’s businesses have been encouraged to “go global” and invest abroad to find new markets, secure access to energy and raw materials, and enhance their competitiveness by acquiring new technologies, brands, and management skills.
你还可以想象一下如果没有这项发明增加的粮食产量，地球只能供养约50亿人口 — — 至少比今天的人口少20亿之多。	Or that without the added food made possible by their discovery, the earth could only support about 4 billion people – at least 2 billion less than today.
许多美国人或许已经习惯了特朗普疯疯癫癫的长篇大论，因为他们已经见识过这位总统对反对者及共和党同事、甚至他自己内阁成员的长达几个月的深夜推特攻击。	Many Americans have perhaps grown desensitized to Trump’s off-the-wall tirades, having endured months of his late-night Twitter assaults on the press, his opponents and fellow Republicans, even his own cabinet members.
尽管他也设法从当地药房拿到了止痛药 — — 这样的剧烈疼痛可能因为他的腿断了 — — 但他既没有时间也没有钱去看外科。	Although he had managed to obtain medication from a local pharmacy for the agonizing pain – probably because his leg was broken – he could spare neither the time nor the money to see a surgeon.
世界上行之有效的方法包括限制电视宣传，特别是对少年儿童；如BBC这样的非商业化，公有电视网络 ； （ 在限定的）电视时间内免费播放政治选举宣传片。	Successful approaches around the world include limits on TV advertising, especially to young children; non-commercial, publicly-owned TV networks like the BBC; and free (but limited) TV time for political campaigns.
但2008年后，金融危机前即已呈上升态势的实测不平等现象已经大幅加剧，而这主要是由经常被赞誉为防止大萧条再次爆发的同样那些措施造成的。	But, since 2008, measured inequality, which was rising even before the financial crisis, has surged, owing largely to the very measures that are so often lauded for preventing another Great Depression.
葛里萨对债务合同中的“平等对待”条款做出了独特的解释，认为这意味着拒绝参与早先的债务转换的“兀鹫”基金不应该获得三折偿付，而应该获得足额偿付。	Griesa idiosyncratically reinterpreted the pari passu, or equal treatment, clause in the debt contracts to mean that “vulture” funds refusing to participate in the earlier debt exchange should receive not 30 but 100 cents on the dollar.
完全匿名的做法解释了效率法则为什么没有引来抗议，比如当资源有限的时候放弃救治诊疗成本最为“昂贵”的病人。	Full anonymity explains why efficiency rules – say, leaving the most “expensive” patients untreated when resources are scarce – meet with no protest.
中国企业已经可以将自动和手动装配流水线协同运作，还可以通过合理化运作和提高能源利用率来提升自身的生产力表现，向全球同行看齐。	Chinese companies have already shown that they can mix automated and manual assembly lines. They also can raise productivity by rationalizing operations and improving energy efficiency, bringing their performance closer to that of their global peers.
以色列政府在2013年为园区提供了3400万美元资金，而自2001年以来都在很大程度上执掌着该项目的约旦则提供了持续的财政支持。	Israel’s government contributed $34 million in 2013. Jordan, which has largely directed the project since 2001, provides ongoing fiscal support.
该决议在1967年11月被批准，要求以色列从其在最新的冲突中所占领的领土中撤退 — — 但也承认了以色列在安全并获得承认的边境内生活的权利。	Approved in November 1967, the resolution called for Israel to withdraw from territories occupied in the recent conflict – but also upheld Israel’s right to live within secure and recognized boundaries.
但是，只有欧洲重新树立信心并且发挥积极的作用，这一时刻才有可能。 而这一作用必须与美国协力，而非与之作对。	But that can happen only if the EU regains its confidence and steps into a positive role – one that it must play with, not against, the US.
安倍已经建立了与印度的紧密关系，并将改善对俄关系 — — 二战后日本从未与俄罗斯媾和 — — 视为地区实力平衡的缺失的一角。	Abe has already built a close relationship with India, and he sees improved relations with Russia – with which Japan never formally made peace after World War II – as the missing ingredient for a regional power equilibrium.
鉴于温室效应所固有的巨大惯性，负责和不负责行为所导致的温差将在25年后才得以显现，而产生重大后果则需要50年。	Given the massive inertia inherent in the greenhouse effect, the gap between responsible and irresponsible behavior will start resulting in different temperatures only in a quarter-century, and major consequences will follow only in 50 years.
在此次地震发生一年多之后的2010年7月，检查官法比奥·皮库迪（Fabio Picuti）以误杀和玩忽职守罪对委员会成员提起公诉，认为他们未能将如此迫近的危险告知公众。	More than a year later, in July 2010, prosecutor Fabio Picuti charged the Commission members with manslaughter and negligence for failing to warn the public of the impending risk.
而这仍是中国经济“文艺复兴“般的巨大繁荣 — — 尽管某些其中的效应是如此困扰这位年老的女爱国者 — — 中国的经济复苏是当今世界史上最非凡的成就。	Yet it is China’s economic renaissance – some of whose effects so disturbed this patriotic old woman – which has been the most remarkable event in recent world history.
这种共同体会产生赢家和输家，因为多数群体可以强迫推行它的偏好，即使其成员所获得收益大大小于少数群体所蒙受的损失。	Here, there are winners and losers, because the majority can force through its preferences, even if the gains its members reap are dwarfed by the losses incurred by the minority.
现在我们面临双重挑战：既要改善位于薪资分布下底端的大量人群的境况，又要创造足够多的高质量岗位吸收每年数以千万计的新晋劳动力大军。	We are now faced with the twin challenges of improving the lot of those at the lower end of the wage distribution, while creating enough new high-quality jobs for the tens of millions of new labor-market entrants each year.
他荒谬地声称奥巴马总统“建立”了伊斯兰国，不过，在坚持了两天后，他就将这番话描述为仅仅是一种讽刺，试图以此蒙混过关。	After two days of insisting, absurdly, that President Barack Obama “founded” the Islamic State, he finally tried to play the whole thing off as mere sarcasm.
1971年8月2日刊发的《时代》杂志引用一位美国官员的言论 ， “ 这是继纳粹时期的波兰之后最有预谋，也最令人发指的屠杀惨剧 。 ”	Time magazine’s August 2, 1971, issue quoted a United States official saying, “This is the most incredible, calculated thing since the days of the Nazis in Poland.”
许多巴基斯坦人，包括认为当前处于政治真空的前外长萨尔塔·阿齐兹（Sartaz Aziz ） ， 对此都不乐观。	Many Pakistanis, including Sartaz Aziz, a former foreign minister who sees a policy vacuum, are not sanguine.
工资停滞不前的俄亥俄州的工人，或就业岗位移往海外的密歇根州失业选民消费信息的方式也将反应他们的经济状况。	Workers in Ohio whose wages have stagnated, or unemployed voters in Michigan whose jobs have migrated overseas, will consume information in a way that reflects their economic situation.
二十年前，同一批自由派评论者催生了一个不可能的梦想：让金融化资本主义（financialized capitalism）全球化能为绝大多数人带来繁荣。	Twenty years ago, the same liberal commentators were cultivating the impossible dream that globalizing financialized capitalism would deliver prosperity for most.
至于日本，首相安倍晋三应该利用他在10月大选中赢得的国会决定性优势去实施安倍经济学的第三个“箭头 ” ： 有利于增长的结构性改革。	As for Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should take advantage of his commanding majority in the Diet, won in October’s snap general election, to implement the third “arrow” of Abenomics: pro-growth structural reforms.
但说到底，德雷德·斯科特案的裁决既不符合基本道德，也不符合日益崛起的北方经济和文化实力以及美国历史的前进方向。	Ultimately, however, the Dred Scott ruling was out of touch not only with basic morality, but also with the growing economic and cultural power of the North and the direction of US history.
它受不平等性影响的程度比诸多发达工业国都要低（尽管比加拿大和北欧国家更大 ） ， 它的环境保护眼光更加长远。	It suffers from less inequality than many advanced industrial countries (though more than Canada and the northern European countries), and it has had a longer-standing commitment to environment preservation.
讽刺的是，旨在加强金融稳定的监管总是奖励短视行为（更高的流动性 ） ， 反而导致长期项目的风险权重和成本的增加（大部分绿色投资是长期项目 ） 。	The irony is that regulations aimed at strengthening financial stability tend to reward short-termism (higher liquidity), adding risk-weights and costs to long-term projects – that is, most green investments.
而同样让我大开眼界的是，来自世界上各地、各种不同背景的人们对于军法、宗教活动以及猪流感等范围甚广的话题的探讨也加深了我对这些问题的理解，并扩大了我获取新闻线索的来源。	But I have also had many eye-opening experiences as people from around the world and from every background deepen my understanding and sourcing about issues as far-ranging as military law, religious practices, and swine flu.
哥伦比亚的和平将让拉美选民进一步了解务实主义的好处比意识形态更大，其效果甚至要好于当前的经济困境，后者主要是全球因素造成的。	Even more than current economic struggles, which are driven largely by global forces, peace in Colombia will reinforce for Latin American voters the benefits of pragmatism over ideology – something that even FARC has recognized.

法国政府顾问法国战略公司（France Stratégie）和美国企业家尼克·哈瑙尔（Nick Hanauer）提出了概念基础相同的社会政策改革。	France Stratégie, which advises the French government, and the American entrepreneur Nick Hanauer have proposed social-policy reforms that share a similar conceptual foundation.
如果推动减税的人坚持不接受现实，那么，他们的议程如果实施，将导致预算赤字大幅扩大，从而让国民债务提高到前所未有的高度。	If those pushing for tax cuts stick to their guns and refuse to accept reality, their agenda, if enacted, would result in a significantly wider budget deficit, which would increase the national debt to unprecedentedly high levels.
一个例子是中国国家主席习近平最近对英国的访问 — — 从本质上说，这也是中国通过与英国建立一系列贸易、金融和投资联系削弱英美“特殊关系”的尝试。	One example is President Xi Jinping’s recent visit to the United Kingdom – which in essence is also an attempt to weaken Britain’s “special relationship” with the US by creating a cat’s cradle of trade, financial, and investment ties with Britain.
与此同时，在美国，珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）领导下的美联储不再质疑在就业发生重大改善之前停止购买长期资产、提高利率是否合适。	Meanwhile, in the US, the Federal Reserve under Janet Yellen is no longer wondering whether it is appropriate to stop purchasing long-term assets and raise interest rates until there is a significant upturn in employment.
欧洲银行给俄罗斯机构和企业的贷款接近2,000亿欧元，并且持有很大一部分俄罗斯的欧元计价资产，这使它们极易受到冲击。	Europe’s banks have extended almost €200 billion ($268 billion) in loans to Russian institutions and firms, and hold a significant share of Russia’s euro-denominated assets, making them especially vulnerable.
华盛顿—美国总统特朗普显然与他不喜欢的数据不“对付 ” ， 在上任第一天，他的这一点就表现得淋漓尽致：攻击媒体准确地报道其就职典礼的观众规模。	WASHINGTON, DC – US President Donald Trump has an obvious problem with data that he doesn’t like, as he showed on his first full day in office, by attacking the media for reporting accurately the size of the crowd that attended his inauguration.
但相关人士已经公开承认，如果不具备大幅度提升的机构能力 — — 如资源充足且能力出众的地方和国家医疗系统 — — 那么取得更大进步的空间将会受到限制。	Yet those involved have recognized publicly that without greatly improved institutional capacity – for example, well-resourced and competent local and national health systems – further progress will be limited.
这很可能会导致经济竞争力的慢慢消失。 这一更大的危险目前却因为欧盟资金的补贴所带来的，也是帮助政府得以维系公众支持的经济的暂时繁荣而被掩盖了。	This will likely result in a gradual loss of economic competitiveness ­– all the more dangerous for being obscured by the temporary boost from EU funds, which will help maintain the government’s popular support.
协议失败往往不是因为写进协议的内容，而是因为没有写入的部分，或者因为签字方明明签字同意却违反自己的承诺。	When agreements fail, it is usually not because of what they contain, but because of what is missing, or because of what the signatories do despite what they have agreed.
就在最近的九、十月份，美联储和欧洲中央银行都将通货膨胀的风险大致等同于增长的风险，两者都不愿大幅降低利率。	As recently as September and October, the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank both saw the risk of inflation as being roughly equal to the risk to growth.
早在今年6月恩格尔就推出了《朝鲜核基线法案 》 ， 该法案将要求白宫报告朝鲜核计划的进展状况，并为继续谈判提供一条进展“基线 ” 。	Back in June, Engel introduced the North Korea Nuclear Baseline Act, which would require the White House to report on the status of North Korea’s nuclear program and provide a “baseline” of progress for continued talks.
而据理查德·图尔为共识研究中心所做的研究，到2100年，全球最有效的碳减排计划 — — 旨在温度上升幅度控制在2摄氏度之内 — — 将每年耗费40万亿美元。	The most efficient, global carbon cuts – designed to keep temperature increases under two degrees Celsius – would cost $40 trillion a year by 2100, according to research by Richard Tol for the Copenhagen Consensus Center.
2008到2009年曾有一段短暂的时间，美国经济看起来可能即将进行重大的结构调整，如果美国经济能够削弱消费的统治地位，某些结构性调整可能会发挥有益的作用。	And for a brief period in 2008-2009, it looked as though the US economy could be on the verge of a major structural adjustment, some of which could have been helpful, if it reduced consumer dominance.
结果，我们陷入了一种未宣布的知识紧急状态（state of intellectual emergency ） ， 令人遗憾的是，这种状态酝酿了恐怖袭击发生后政府所宣布的紧急状态。	As a consequence, we find ourselves in an undeclared state of intellectual emergency, one that, regrettably, has given rise to the states of emergency that our governments proclaim in the wake of terrorist attacks.
2016 ， 《 经济学人 》 （ The Economist）认为全球化的“短期成本和收益”之间的“平衡臂教科书所认为的更加微妙 ” 。	In 2016, The Economist conceded that “short-term costs and benefits” from globalization are “more finely balanced than textbooks assume.”
政府累积债务的账面价值并未改变，银行债务 — — 除了欠普通债权人（junior creditors）的一些债务以外，也基本没变。	The value of inherited government debts remains intact, and, aside from a handful of obligations to so-called junior creditors, bank debts also remain untouched.
一名1990年代的著名运动员曾说 ： “ 如果能对赢得比赛有利的话，我每周都会发表种族主义言论 。 ”	A famous player of the 1990’s said at the time, “I’d make a racist comment every week if I thought it would help win the game.”
因为国外问题重重，国内民众牢骚满腹，沙特皇族的某些成员亦对其疾速上升颇为不满，萨尔曼王储需要证明自己具备成为领导人的成熟度和经验。	Given the problems abroad and grumbling at home, where some in the Saudi royal family resent his meteoric ascent, MBS now needs to prove that he has the maturity and experience to lead.
“当今最有用的公民权形式 ， ” 一位分析师向她呛声 ， “ 就是不但要致力于伯克希尔教区的福祉，也要致力于整个地球的福祉 。 ”	“The most useful form of citizenship these days,” one analyst lectured her, “is one dedicated not only to the wellbeing of a Berkshire parish, say, but to the planet.”
在全球金融危机之前，贸易和出口分别贡献了全国 GDP 的 67% 和 37 % ， 但危机发生之后这两项所占的比重都严重下滑。	Trade and exports accounted for 67% and 37% of the country’s GDP, respectively, before the global crisis, but have since fallen significantly.
预算削减 — — 加上问责的压力以及新技术的挑战 — — 也正在损害及威胁那些旨在提供良好治理的倡议及项目。	Budget cuts – together with accountability issues and new technological challenges – are also hurting those tasked with delivering good governance.
危险在于党的领导人为了转移人们对于共产主义衰落的注意，而转向民族主义作为意识形态的粘合剂，从而形成好斗的外交政策，包括比如与台湾的冲突。	The danger is that Party leaders, trying to counter the erosion of communism, will turn to nationalism to provide ideological glue, which could lead to an unstable foreign policy – including, for example, conflict over Taiwan.
去年的高级别会议决议，成员国代表将在两年后再次开会评估进展情况 — — 因此，下一次会议是在2018年9月。	Last year’s High-Level Meeting resolved that member-state delegates are to reconvene for a progress assessment after two years – so, in September 2018.
中国一份官方报纸发表社论称尽管中国在朝鲜首先发起攻击的情况下会保持中立，但美国以政权更迭为目标的打击行动将会导致中国介入。	A recent editorial in a Chinese state-run newspaper asserted that while China would stay neutral if North Korea attacked first, US strikes aimed at regime change would cause China to intervene.
这些反映在人们的穿着风格上，反映在他们在公众场合的表现以及他们所运用的语言上的价值观已经不是人类生活的价值观。	These values – reflected in the way people dress, how they behave in public, and the language they speak – are not the values of human life.
今年，美国国家卫生研究所（National Institutes of Health，NIH，世界领先的医学研究中心）的资金比2012年减少了十亿美元。	This year, funding for the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) – one of the world’s leading medical research centers – is a billion dollars lower than in 2012.
和游叙佛伦一样，特朗普不但认为他了解他所了解的，并且认为他所了解的足以做出可靠的决策；他非常确定这一点。	Like Euthyphro, Trump does not just think that he knows what he knows, and that what he knows is sufficient for sound decision-making; he is absolutely sure of it.
印度一位最优秀的演员Irfan Khan突然间接受洗礼并改名Irrfan，很多人信誓旦旦地认为这预示着他的演艺生涯即将转型。	One of India’s finest actors, Irfan Khan, suddenly re-baptized himself Irrfan, a change that many swear prefigured the transformation of his career.
在79个国家中，有39个仍是三部分立模式，23个国家拥有了统一的监管机构（其中九个更是升格为货币当局 ） 。	Of the 79 countries, 39 still operate a three-way sectoral breakdown, and 23 have integrated agencies (nine of which double up as the monetary authority).
美国也许看到了复苏强化的信号，但欧元区仍有步日本衰退后尘的危险，而新兴市场也在担忧出口拉动增长战略使使它们极易受国外停滞的影响。	The United States may be seeing signs of a strengthening recovery, but the eurozone risks following Japan into recession, and emerging markets worry that their export-led growth strategies have left them vulnerable to stagnation abroad.
两位左翼明星伊丽莎白·沃伦（Elizabeth Warren）和伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）也为克林顿摇旗呐喊；如果她获胜，他们将要求政策和任命方面的回报。	Two stars of the left, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have also campaigned for Clinton; if she wins, they will call in the debt both in policy terms and on appointees.
回到宏观层面，中国需要在各级政府间重新分配责任和资源，以利用它们在提供服务和筹集收入方面的比较优势。	Back at the macro level, China needs to reallocate responsibilities and resources among the various levels of government, in order to capitalize on their comparative advantage in providing services and raising revenue.
有关个人结果的预期随着时间的推移几乎鲜有变化，而有关国家经济表现的预期却会如人们所预料的那样随经济衰退而恶化，并随经济繁荣而改善。	Expectations about individual outcomes move very little over time, while expectations about national economic performance worsen with recessions and improve with booms, just as you might expect.
与大众所说的相反的是，法律与正义党2005年的胜利并非来源于“改革疲劳 ” ， 因为在2000年到2005年期间，除了一次对财政合并雄心勃勃而又中途而废的企图之外，并没有实行多少改革。	Contrary to popular cliché, PiS’s victory in 2005 did not result from “reform fatigue,” since there were not many reforms implemented in 2000-2005 (except for an ambitious but partially blocked attempt at fiscal consolidation).
另外，亚洲新兴工业国家的投资率也从来没有恢复到1997-1998年金融危机以前的水平。 而除中国以外的其他亚洲地区的投资率也下降了。	Moreover, investment rates in the newly industrialized economies of Asia have never recovered to their pre-1997-8 crisis levels, and investment rates in the rest of Asia outside China have fallen off as well.
因此，IMF不顾压倒性证据，把目标对准了剩下的部分 — — 退休金，而退休金也已经做出了巨大的削减（很多人的退休金降低了40 % ） 。	So, in defiance of overwhelming evidence, the IMF now wants to target the remaining sector, pensions, where massive cuts – more than 40% in many cases – have already been made.
美国剑桥—美国总统奥巴马和中国国家主席习近平上个月在加州举行了“习奥会 ” ， 在他们的会谈中，朝鲜是一个重要话题。	CAMBRIDGE – When US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping met for their “shirt-sleeves summit” in California last month, North Korea was a major topic of conversation.
英格兰银行行长马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）让我们得以通过地下银行一窥针线大街老妪（Old Lady of Threadneedle Street ） ， 应该受到赞扬（当然，假设该博客并非完全是未经许可的自说自话！ ） 。	The BoE’s governor, Mark Carney, deserves great credit for allowing us to peer through a small crack in the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street’s façade (assuming, of course, that the blog is not a wholly unlicensed initiative!).
他们可以发挥实质性的领导作用，联合缅甸各政党、中国、印度、欧盟、俄罗斯和美国为缅甸的变革制定一份路线图。	They could play an essential leading role in a process including the Burmese parties, China, India, the European Union, Russia, and the United States that could devise a roadmap for change in Burma.
根本不会有人关心（比如）佛罗里达州对美国其余部分的经常项目赤字，尽管我们可以大胆猜测这笔赤字不会小（因为大量来自其他地区的依靠退休福利生活的退休人士生活在佛罗里达州 ） 。	No one even keeps track of, say, Florida’s current-account deficit with the rest of the country, although we can safely guess that it is huge (since the state is home to many retirees living off benefits that come from elsewhere).
但报告也基本没有提出解决方案，也不承认治疗和增强应用之间的组别，这意味着这些技术有可能被滥用于整形目的。	But, again, the report offers little in the way of solutions, and it largely rejects the distinction between therapeutic and enhancement applications, which leaves open the possibility that such technologies could be misused for cosmetic purposes.
比如，今年夏天，由于普遍的贫困和制度缺失、种族迫害阴魂不散以及对不熟悉的民主进程的不信任，圭亚那人民走上了街头，引发了暴力示威。	This summer in Guinea, for example, citizens’ frustration with widespread poverty and weak institutions, memories of ethnic persecution, and distrust of unfamiliar democratic processes fueled violent protests.
当局意在同时提高朝鲜的国际地位和国内士气，朝鲜人民想必将热烈支持这一计划，并将之视为朝鲜技术和军事实力的展示。	The regime aims to boost North Korea’s international prestige and domestic morale simultaneously, with the population supposedly keen to support this show of the country’s technological and military might.
她可以利用这次机会暗示新的欧洲一体化方针，这个方针从受害最深的国家、一个欧元区错误的货币设计和自身社会失败的双重受害国开始。	She could use the opportunity to hint at a new approach to European integration, one that starts in the country that has suffered the most, a victim both of the eurozone’s faulty monetary design and of its society’s own failings.
二十国集团财政部长已将2018年年度增长目标定在2 % ， 并且正在筛选900余份结构性改革方案以实现这一目标。	G-20 finance ministers have already decided on a 2% target for annual growth through 2018, and are sifting through more than 900 proposals for structural reforms in order to achieve this.
因此，当佩林被推到媒体的聚光灯下时，她成了那些没有机会表达自己的观点、筋疲力尽的工厂工人符号性的报复幻想。	So, when Sarah Palin is escorted into the media limelight, she becomes the symbolic revenge fantasy of many of those silenced, exhausted factory workers and secretaries.
要实现这一目标，中国必须实现从制造业到服务业，从出口依赖到国内消费，从国有到私营，从农村到城市的转型再平衡。	To get there, China must go through a transformative rebalancing, from manufacturing to services, from export dependence to domestic consumption, from state-owned to private, and from rural to urban.
可以影响人类行为的另一物种是原生弓形虫，弓形虫病的随机主体。 弓形虫极为常见，按照气候和饮食的不同，各国有15%到85%的感染率。	Another species that can affect human behavior is the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the causal agent of Toxoplasmosis.T. gondii is extremely common, with an infection rate of 15-85% across different countries, depending on climate and diet.
如果克里米亚遭到吞并，谁也没资格反对乌克兰重新实现防御有核化（在技术上乌克兰依然有能力这样做 ） 。	Should Crimea be annexed, no one should gainsay Ukraine if it rapidly re-nuclearized its defense (which it retains the technological capacity to do).
扩大获取培训和认证的机会将有助于各国利用这些进步并确保实现更公平的增长，并为工人提供处理新工作所需的技能。	Improving access to training and certification would help countries capitalize on these advances and ensure more equitable growth, by giving workers the skills needed to handle the new jobs.
联合国开发计划署前署长Bimal Ghosh所做的计算广为人知，那就是目前欧盟每天每头牛的补贴为2.50欧元¾超过了全世界成百上千万贫困人口的日收入。	Bimal Ghosh, a former director of the UN Development Program, famously calculated that the daily subsidy for every cow in the EU – currently amounting to €2.50 – exceeds the daily income of millions of poor people around the world.
目前，大旱、营养不良和贫困仍然顽固难除，爆发致命的腹泻病、让这个脆弱的国家陷入瘫痪的情景似乎难以避免。	With crippling drought, malnutrition, and poverty already endemic, an outbreak of deadly diarrhea seemed destined to paralyze the fragile state. But, despite the dire predictions, institutional paralysis was avoided.
随后，11月7日，可口可乐也就乐施会的号召做出了回应，它将对供应商和灌装商的土地掠夺行为“零容忍 ” 。	Then, on November 7, Coca-Cola responded to the Oxfam campaign by declaring that it would have “zero tolerance” for land grabbing by its suppliers and bottlers.
多年来我一直很喜欢克劳萨默的著作，但我在他的著作中觉察到一种令人不安的情绪：他以气候变化的“不可知论者”来形容自己。	I have enjoyed Krauthammer’s writing over the years, but there was something in his book that I found deeply troubling: his description of himself as an “agnostic” on climate change.
当妇女能获得基本的金融服务，如开立信贷和储蓄账户时，性别平等的好处也是显而易见的。 这使得她们能够开办企业，并存钱用于家庭生活必需品的采购。	The benefits of gender equity are also apparent when women have access to basic financial services, like credit and savings accounts, which enable them to start businesses and save money for family essentials.
上述结果与所谓的索洛计算机悖论相一致：生产率的提升落后于技术进步 — — 这是数字革命期间一个值得关注的现象。	This is in line with the so-called Solow computer paradox: productivity gains lag behind technological advances – a notable phenomenon during the digital revolution.
这反过来将带来“税收收入的相应增加 ” ， 从而“有助于财政可持续性，同时让希腊政府能够遵守支出纪律而不进一步拖累社会经济 ” 。	This, in turn, would induce “proportional increases in tax revenues,” thereby “contributing to fiscal sustainability, while enabling the Greek government to exercise spending discipline without further shrinking the social economy.”
其操作可以类似于2010年为了解决美国财政挑战而成立的跨党派的国家财政责任和改革委员会（National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform ） ， 或者20世纪八九十年代的军事基地关闭委员会（military-base-closing commissions ） 。	This would operate much like the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, established in 2010 to address America’s fiscal challenges, or the military-base-closing commissions of the 1980s and 1990s.
与会各国将考虑提高为达成雄心勃勃的爱知生物多样性目标（Aichi Biodiversity Targets）而投入的必要资源。 爱知目标是两年前日本联合国生物多样性会议上提出的。	The assembled countries will consider how to raise the resources necessary to achieve the ambitious Aichi Biodiversity Targets, adopted two years ago at the last such meeting in Japan.
在透明国际的《2010全球清廉指数》中，乌克兰得分为2.4（打分范围为0—10，0表示高度腐败，10表示高度清廉 ） 。	On Transparency International´s Corruption Perceptions Index 2010, Ukraine scored 2.4 on a scale from zero (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean).
共和党挑战者罗姆尼在第一轮电视辩论中大获全胜，增加了他的当选机会，在就伊朗核问题做出任何重大决定之前，美国可能产生一个新政府。	Republican challenger Mitt Romney’s success in the first debate improves his chances and the prospect of a new administration settling in before any major decisions are made on the Iranian nuclear issue.
2005年3月，警方曾使用暴力驱散了庆祝国际妇女节的民众游行；5月，最大的教师协会也因为提倡1400万库尔德人使用本民族语言进行教学而被取缔。	In March 2005, the police violently disrupted a demonstration to celebrate International Women’s Day. In May, the largest teachers’ union was banned for promoting the education of Turkey’s 14 million Kurds in their own language.
他或许会对阿萨德部队再次发动一两轮攻击，可此举既不能改变那里的力量对比，也无力提升他本人在这个饱受战争蹂躏之国的地位，更别提整个中东了。	Ordering an attack or two against Assad’s forces, as he might do, would neither alter the balance of power there, nor improve Trump’s position in the war-torn country, let alone the Middle East in general.
这使得公众媒体痛批我们正生活在一个耗资巨大，官僚习气深重，而且低效率的“人权文化”当中 — — 这可算是一个引发深层次政治回响的指控。	This has led the popular press to howl that we now live in a costly, bureaucratic, and inefficient “human rights culture” – a charge with profound political resonance.
更糟糕的是，这可能正中金正恩的下怀，因为他的科学家赢得了掌握技术的时间 — — 特别是核武器微型化技术，一旦成功，就能在公开撕破协议之后迅速列装。	Worse still, this could even work in Kim’s favor, by buying time for his scientists to master technologies – particularly nuclear-warhead miniaturization – that could then be quickly deployed once the deal is publicly broken.
欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国可能选择退出的最明显的原因，是为了避免因为单一货币所造成的不区分具体情形而适用于所有成员国的货币政策。	The most obvious reason that a country might choose to withdraw is to escape from the one-size-fits-all monetary policy imposed by the single currency.
然而在今年十月底，她最终为欧洲的未来勾勒了一个远景，并以此说服德国联邦议会同意拯救欧元的一揽子计划。	At the end of October, however, she finally articulated a vision of the future of Europe that persuaded the German Bundestag to agree to a package of measures to save the euro.
他们最佳的论点都取自米尔顿·弗里德曼、弗里德里希·冯·哈耶克和罗伯特·诺齐克，这些人寻求在总体上挑战社会的集体主义理论，尤其是挑战“社会主义 ” 。	Their best intellectual arguments derived from Milton Friedman, Friedrich von Hayek, and Robert Nozick, who sought to challenge collectivist theories of society in general and “socialism” in particular.
尽管过去石油公司作过很多关于清理的承诺，奥贡尼兰依旧处于恶劣的环境状况之下，该地区已经被石油产业榨干了财富而且疾病肆虐。	Despite many past promises of a cleanup, Ogoniland remains in environmental agony, impoverished and sickened by the oil industry.
而公众不是唯一的“受害者 ” ： 就连鲁哈尼的一位经济顾问一开始也夸耀说，人们的境况改善了20 % ， 因为通货膨胀率下降了20个百分点。	And the lay public was not alone: even one of Rouhani’s economic advisers initially boasted that people were 20% better off because the rate of inflation had declined by 20 percentage points.
今年，联合国将就2015年后的可持续发展目标（Sustainable Development Goals，SDG）展开讨论，我强烈地希望非洲政府能够支持纳入这些追求公正的可测目标。	As the debate on the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals unfolds at the United Nations this year, it is my fervent hope that African governments will endorse the inclusion within these goals of measurable targets for access to justice.
结果是三十年战争（Thirty Years’ War ） — —欧洲历史上最暴力、破坏力最强的事件，直到20世纪才被两次世界大战超越。	The result was the Thirty Years’ War, the most violent and destructive episode in European history until the two world wars of the twentieth century.
在他对人类勇气和怯懦的积极探究中，挪威剧作家亨利克·易卜生（Henrik Ibsen）在他的散文剧《人民公敌》中写道 ： “ 一个社区就像一艘船；每个人都应随时准备好接过船舵 。 ”	In his searing study of human courage and cowardice, “An Enemy of the People,” the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen wrote, “A community is like a ship; everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm.”
15年前由瑞士科学家率先开发出来的黄金大米是专门为解决维生素A缺乏而开发的，第一批试种在十年前便已展开。	First developed 15 years ago by Swiss scientists, golden rice specifically addresses vitamin A deficiency, and the first field trials were conducted a decade ago.
它们将利用生命体征情况（Vital Signs Profiles）迅速获得有用又容易理解的初级医疗信息。	With Vital Signs Profiles, they can quickly access information on primary care that is both useful and easy to understand.
重组给了银行一个新生的机会：新的投资者（不论是资产抵押或是债券重组）将更有信心，其他银行也会乐于把资金借给他们。 对于债券人来说。	Restructuring gives banks a chance for a new start: new potential investors (whether in equity or debt instruments) will have more confidence, other banks will be more willing to lend to them, and they will be more willing to lend to others.
人们对此次会议抱有的希望是，中国领导层最终会采取一些措施 — — 最好是大胆的措施 — — 来阻止中国主要经济指标的进一步下滑。	The hope was that the Chinese leadership would finally do something – preferably something bold – to forestall further decline in the country’s major economic indicators.
在长达14年的军事干预伊拉克失败后，美国应当承认像国务院发言人不久前所说的“建立一个团结、稳定、民主和联合的伊拉克”仅仅是一个美梦。	After 14 years of failed military intervention in Iraq, the US should recognize that “a unified, stable, democratic, and federal Iraq,” as a State Department spokesperson recently put it, is a chimera.
尽管增长对未来全球经济至关重要，但增长的方式却必须改变 — — 未来的经济增长必须更具包容性，而不是单纯来源于不受约束的全球化进程。	While growth is essential for the future global economy, it must be a different kind of growth – inclusive and not simply the fallout of unfettered globalization.
因此，任何一个能够阅读这篇文章的印度人都应该感觉到自己是幸运的，因为印度的政客已经成功地将这个国家的大多数人口停留为十足的文盲（穷人和病人 ） 。	Indeed, any Indian able to read this article should consider himself lucky, because India’s politicians have succeeded in keeping a majority of the country’s population thoroughly illiterate (as well as poor and unhealthy).
换句话说，这些国家不仅借出了自己从经常项目盈余中赚得的钱，还把它们从资本项目盈余中借来的钱也借出去了 — — 主要是借给美国。	In other words, these countries lend not only the money they earned through current-account surpluses, but also the money they borrowed through capital-account surpluses – mainly to the United States.
但如果届时居住在地球上的96亿人口都吃素食的话，就可以放弃工业���食生产，不需要增加农地就能养活所有人。	But if the 9.6 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by then were to have a plant-based diet, industrial meat production could be abandoned and all of them could be fed without the need for any additional agricultural land.
问题是现今对乌克兰人、格鲁吉亚人，更别说是意大利人而言，来自俄罗斯的“基督教”石油和天然气，与普京所承诺的充分保障和绝无隐忧也相去甚远。	The problem today is that for Ukrainians, Georgians, not to mention Italians, “Christian” oil and gas from Russia does not seem nearly as secure and as fail-proof as Putin promised.
在2008年危机爆发前的20年时间里，就业水平得以维持，收入水平的下降压力也得到了缓解，这要归功于非贸易部门所创造的就业岗位。	For two decades prior to the 2008 crisis, employment levels were maintained – and downward pressure on incomes mitigated – by creating jobs in non-tradable sectors.
由于国际官僚喜好所谓“最佳实务”和共同标准，这些机构根本难以做到寻求具有创新性、适应各国特殊国情的独特的途径。	As international bureaucracies with a penchant for “best practices” and common standards, these institutions are woefully unsuited to the task of seeking innovative, unique pathways suited to each country’s particular circumstances.
成交的最高价是巴尼特·纽曼（Barnett Newman ） 、 弗朗西斯·培根（Francis Bacon ） 、 马克·罗斯科（Mark Rothko）和安迪·沃霍尔（Andy Warhol）等人的作品，每件在6,000万美元以上。	Among the higher-priced works sold were paintings by Barnett Newman, Francis Bacon, Mark Rothko, and Andy Warhol, each of which sold for more than $60 million.
实际上，尽管中央政府有权征收现有油田产生的收益，但是法律并不禁止地方官员将旧油田现代化，然后声称这些是新油田。	In fact, although the central government has the authority to collect the revenues generated by existing fields, there is no law to prevent local officials from modernizing old sites and claiming that they are new.
解决这些冲突至少需要一些基本游戏规则，而这些规则只有在多边基础上才能制定和实施，而不是中国所要求的双边方式。	Resolving such conflicts requires, at a minimum, some baseline rules of the game, which can be developed and implemented only on a multilateral basis, not in the unilateral way that China demands.
目前市场中关于年终奖金正卷土重来，对冲基金实现了两位数的收益以及私人股本市场的复苏等传闻已在满天飞。	Already the market is full of rumors that guaranteed bonuses are returning, that hedge funds are making double-digit returns, and that activity is reviving in the private equity market.
投票留在欧盟后，英国就可以开始修复其在欧盟声誉的进程 — — 我们长久以来吹毛求疵、三心二意的俱乐部会员形象严重损害了英国的声誉。	Following such a vote, the UK could begin to repair its reputation in the EU – a reputation that has been severely undermined by our prolonged status as the carping, semi-detached member of the club.
必须由化石燃料方案 — — 尤其是煤炭 — — 来承担举证责任，证明在完全承担环境、健康和社会成本后，它们的竞争力仍然最强。	The burden of proof must be on fossil-fuel-based solutions – particularly coal – to demonstrate their competitiveness after accounting for the full environmental, health, and social costs.
在这两个例子中，重获货币主权让两国得以拥有更具竞争力的货币，这反过来增加了出口需求、刺激了经济复苏。	In both cases, regaining monetary sovereignty allowed a more competitive currency, which in turn increased export demand and assisted economic recovery.
这与国际金融研究所（Institute of International Finance，IIF，全球顶级银行主要交易联盟）的结果大相径庭。 IIF认为，提高资本要求会造成严重后果。	In sharp contrast, the Institute of International Finance, the leading trade association for the world’s top banks, believes that the impact of higher capital requirements could be far stronger.
而如此多的创新都是免费提供的事实不仅仅为经济学家带来了测量方面的难题；同时也为那些尝试寻找投资机会的人造成了困扰。	The fact that so much innovation is given away for free does not only create a measurement problem for economists; it is also a real problem for those trying to find investment opportunities.
摩尔多瓦的现任政府，欧洲一体化联盟若不是见证了俄罗斯之前如何对待所谓亲西方的格鲁吉亚和乌克兰政府的话，将更加亲近欧洲。	Moldova’s current government, the Alliance for European Integration, might be a lot more pro-European if it had not seen how Russia treated supposedly pro-Western governments in Georgia and Ukraine before it.
当然，导致失败的一个原因是马来亚通过种族差异识别和孤立叛乱群体的公式在越南不管用，因为南越人和北越人并没有足够大的差别。	Of course, one reason for that failure is that the South Vietnamese were not different enough from the North Vietnamese for the Malayan formula of identifying and isolating rebel communities by race to work.
随着通货膨胀率向目标日一靠近，日本银行将不得不在不调整资产负债表规模的情况下开始提高政策和长期利率 — — 美联储已经开始这么做了。	When the inflation rate moves closer to the target, the BOJ will have to start raising its policy and long-term rates without adjusting the size of its balance sheet – which is exactly what the US Federal Reserve is already doing.
俄罗斯的干预站在叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德一边，因此还导致了美俄关系的进一步扭曲，从而影响到世界其他地区的安全。	Russia’s intervention on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has also caused further deterioration in US-Russian relations, which could fuel danger elsewhere in the world.
计划于2016年生效的2012年苏格兰法（Scotland Act of 2012）为这一渴望已久的自治权提供了第一批授权。	The Scotland Act of 2012, scheduled to come into effect in 2016, provides a down payment on this desired autonomy.
在许多人竭力反对Facebook变更私隐政策之时，数百万人正在利用Facebook以及其他社交网站所提供的工具平静地经营着自己的声誉。	While many people are up in arms about Facebook’s shifting privacy policies, millions of others are calmly managing their reputations online, using the tools that Facebook and other social Web sites provide.
但科学在穆斯林世界很多地方面临的挑战十分独特；它被视为世俗 — — 甚至无神论 — — 的西方产物。	And yet, in many parts of the Muslim world, science faces a unique challenge; it is seen as a secular – if not atheist – Western construct.
跨境银行债务社会化意味着一国的私人借贷成本将被人为压低在市场利率以下，因为债务保险（即信用违约互换）将由其他国家免费提供。	Socialization of bank debt across borders implies that a country’s private borrowing costs are artificially reduced below market rates, as insurance (in the form of credit-default swaps) is provided free of charge by other countries.
许多想对按揭进行再融资的人并没有成功，因为它们的房产仍然“在水面以下 ” （ 即他们欠银行的钱比房屋的当前价值还多 ） 。	Many who want to refinance their mortgages still cannot, because they are “underwater” (owing more on their mortgages than the underlying property is worth).
即使美联储无视通缩压力并更迅速提高利率，但由于世界其他地方的利率依然偏低，中期和长期利率仍可能被锁定。	Even if the Fed ignores deflationary pressure and hikes interest rates more quickly, medium- and long-term rates are still likely to be anchored, given how little yield is available elsewhere in the world.
接着，1935年银行法（根据1942年修订内容）将权力从地方联储银行转移到华盛顿美联储理事会手中，并确定了纽约联储银行的特殊地位。	The Banking Act of 1935, as amended in 1942, then shifted power from the Reserve Banks to the Board in Washington, DC, and confirmed the special role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
宗教社会学者早就指出：在奉行单一宗教、或宗教机构与国家联系非常紧密的环境里，公众的总体虔诚度会有所下降。	Sociologists of religion have long argued that in a monolithic religious environment, or when religious institutions are closely tied to the state, the overall religiosity of the public declines.
而且我们不要忘记，以色列中部的收入以及交纳的税收支撑了从加沙地带到耶路撒冷直到约旦河西岸的范围广泛的传统主义者、原教旨主义者、沙文主义者以及其他犹太或者穆斯林的极端主义者。	And, lest we forget, Middle Israel is earning the money and paying the taxes that support a wide assortment of traditionalists, fundamentalists, chauvinists, and other extremists – Jewish and Muslim – from Gaza to Jerusalem to the West Bank.
它的创新导致了一大批新兴和充满活力的公司，迫使IBM为了与它们竞争而洗心格面。 这仅仅是个人电脑的社会转变效力的一个例子而已。	Its innovation gave rise to a huge number of new and dynamic companies, forcing IBM to reinvent itself completely in order to compete with them – just one example of the socially transformative effects of the PC.
欧洲要想回到可持续增长的道路上来，这些规则就必须最终得以恢复，而且人们必须就如何促成这一局面达成一致意见。	These rules must eventually be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth, and a consensus will need to be forged now to make that happen.
在 2009 年 8 月 19 日，也就是联合国驻伊拉克代表被炸身亡整整 6 年之后，又发生了一系列大规模袭击。	On August 19, 2009, the sixth anniversary of the bombing that killed the United Nations representative in Baghdad, a series of spectacular attacks were carried out.
这便是美国和欧洲大规模银行援助的目的，随之而来的是数轮“量化宽松 ” ， 即央行印钱并通过一系列非常规渠道注入银行系统。	This has been the purpose of the vast bank bailouts in the US and Europe, followed by several rounds of “quantitative easing,” by which central banks print money and pump it into the banking system through a variety of unorthodox channels.
墨西哥黄豆、南亚香米、玻利维亚昆诺阿藜、亚马逊卡皮木、印度鹰嘴豆、秘鲁努纳豆、安第斯玛卡 — — 都曾经经历过掠夺性的知识产权诉求。	Mexican beans, South Asian basmati rice, Bolivian quinoa, Amazonian ayahuasca, Indian chickpeas, Peruvian nuña beans, Andean maca – all have been subject to predatory intellectual property claims.
零利率和负利率不但助长了资产市场的短期投机，伤害了长期投资；还破坏了银行、保险公司和基金管理公司的业务模式。	Zero and negative interest rates have not only encouraged short-term speculation in asset markets and harmed long-term investments; they have also destroyed the business model of banks, insurance companies, and fund managers.
但在北美自由贸易协定问题一天未能尘埃落定，新的贸易和投资规则也就一天没法理清和编纂，自然也无力实现投资和经济复苏。	But that will not be forthcoming until the NAFTA issue is laid to rest and new trade and investment rules are clarified and codified.
所谓铁打的宫廷，流水的朝臣 — — 他们可能被夺职，就像特朗普的第一位国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林（Michael Flynn ） ， 也可能被夺命，就像亨利六世六位妻子中的两人 — — 但这不会改变世界的运转。	Individual courtiers might come and go – whether fired, like Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, or beheaded, like two of Henry VIII’s six wives – but it wouldn’t change the dynamics of that world.
上个月，俄天然气宣布去有意在2019年与乌克兰天然气管道公司乌天然气（Naftogaz）合同到期后停止途经乌克兰的输气。	Last month, Gazprom announced its intention to cease shipments through Ukraine when the contracts with the country's gas pipeline company, Naftogaz, expire in 2019.
从某种程度上讲，这些项目属于“成功后买单 ” （ pay-for-success）项目，有时以社会影响债券 — — 将支付与实际结果挂钩的正式契约 — — 的形式出现。	These are, in a sense, pay-for-success projects, sometimes structured as social impact bonds –formal contracts that tie payments to actual results.
2003年，欧元区三个大国（法国、德国和意大利）的赤字都超过了SGP所规定的上限、GDP的3 % 。	In 2003, all three large eurozone countries (France, Germany, and Italy) were running deficits in excess of 3% of GDP, the upper limit established by the SGP.
纳沙泰尔州对外国居民的进步思想很大程度上应该归功于一个人，这个人的名字叫 托马斯·法基内蒂，这个人在二十年前首创并发展了多元文化融合服务。	Much of Neuchatel’s progressive attitude toward foreign residents is attributable to one man, Thomas Facchinetti, who started a multicultural cohesion service 20 years ago and has steadily built it up.
我在11月突然宣布大选，目的是巩固政府的政治资本 — — 不是为了囤积，而是为了将它用于两年前就许下的改革承诺。	By calling in November for a snap general election, my aim was to consolidate the government’s political capital – not in order to hoard it, but to spend it on the reforms that were first promised two years ago.
但是，尽管一些久负盛名的报纸 — — 如《纽约时报 》 、 《华盛顿邮报》和英国的《卫报 》 — —的网络版表现出色，并不足以扭转颓势。	Yet, while some well-known newspapers – such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the United Kingdom-based Guardian – have developed a robust Internet presence themselves, it is not enough.
纵观战后时期，美国通过北约和其他机构支撑着集体安全，并原因面对全新的地区和全球威胁 — — 常常是在没有朋友与它共边的情况下。	Throughout the post-war period, the US has backstopped collective security through NATO and other institutions, and it has been more than willing to brave regional and global threats, often with few friends at its side.
他们尊重他们的生活环境，而美国人则必须“为一个濒死的星球承担起应有的责任 ” ， 因为，正如剧中的土著人所说 ， “ 他们亲手杀死了他们的母亲 。 ”	They respect their environment, whereas the Americans must “return to a dying planet,” because, as the indigenous people put it, “they have killed their own mother.”
由于没有个人和政府为整个互联网制定规则，因此任何数字行为规范都必须来自草根 — — 也因此必然是极不完美的。	Because no single body or government sets rules for the entire Internet, any digital code of conduct would have to emerge from the grassroots – and thus would be highly imperfect.
因此，尽管金融监管得到了实质性加强 — — 这显然是最重要的事情 — — 但其落实仍然需要经过分散的国家机构。	So while financial regulation has been materially strengthened, which is clearly the most important thing, its implementation remains in the hands of a patchwork quilt of national agencies.
比如，在科学家们指出石棉的致癌作用、或用铅管输水造成的神经影响之前，我们并没有制定相应的法律和法规来解决这些问题。	It wasn’t until scientists pointed out the carcinogenic impact of asbestos, for example, or the neurological effects of pumping water through lead pipes, that laws and regulations were enacted to address these problems.
该方案提出成立一个欧洲基金（European Fund ） ， 向重组过程中的银行提供短期融资，并对所有银行一视同仁。	To provide short-term financing to a bank during any restructuring, the Commission’s plan would create a European Fund, putting all banks on an equal footing.
墨西哥城 — — 美国总统唐纳德·特朗普过去18个月来一直是令世界最头疼的问题，而且可以说没有哪个国家比墨西哥受害更重。	MEXICO CITY – US President Donald Trump has been the world’s worst headache for the past 18 months, and arguably no country has suffered more than Mexico.
12月初，黄禹锡披露，其中某些卵子来自于在其实验室工作的两名妇女，而且，其他“捐献者”也为她们的卵子而得到报酬。 这违反了伦理标准，而与科学准确与否无关。	At the beginning of December, Hwang disclosed that some of the eggs came from two women working in his lab, and that other “donors” had been paid for their eggs – a breach of ethical guidelines that had nothing to do with the accuracy of the science.
这两次投票是《 2005 年全面和平协定》的关键要素，由此结束了南方和北方之间长达 20 年的内战。	A referendum on the future status of the south of the country is supposed to follow in 2011. Both were key ingredients of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended 20 years of civil war between north and south.
这样一来，财政赤字货币化可能会成为受到抵制最少的折中方案，毕竟，开动印钞机比削减赤字在政治上容易多了。	Monetizing the fiscal deficits would then become the path of least resistance: running the printing presses is much easier than politically painful deficit reduction.
印度人民党在激进民族主义和亲商社团主义的背景下获得了权力斗争的压倒性胜利，这是否意味着可追溯到印度首任总理、社会民主党人尼赫鲁的社会经济共识走向终结？	With the BJP sweeping to power on a platform of aggressive nationalism and business-friendly corporatism, has the socioeconomic consensus dating to India’s first prime minister, the democratic socialist Jawaharlal Nehru, come to an end?
实现这一目标要求持续地给予服务不完善的农村地区和农民工更多的关注，同时改革社会政策以确保可靠的社会安全网。	Doing so will require greater sustained attention to underserved rural areas and migrant populations, and to restructuring social policies in order to ensure secure safety nets.
因此，看不出这个调整能对双方经常账户的平衡起到什么显著作用，换言之，对美国的失业也不会有什么作用，因为后者也是储蓄和投资行为的一种反映。	There is no reason, therefore, why it should have a first-order impact on the bilateral current-account balance, or, for that matter, on unemployment, which depends on the same saving and investment behavior.
如果欧元区成员资格不再稳固，如果不遵守共同规则的国家可以踢出了事，那么各国就会更加努力地保留这一资格。	If eurozone membership cannot be taken for granted, if countries that do not abide by the common rules can simply be kicked out, countries will try harder to hold onto it.
在广义外交政策和安全问题上，在面临美国所带来的核心战略挑战的情况下，2019年的中国可能与其他国家“去冲突化 ” 。	On the wider foreign policy and security front, China in 2019 is likely to “de-conflict” itself in its relations with other countries, given the core strategic challenges posed by the US.
神牛保护协会（Gau Rakshak Samitis）重新兴起，而其成员有时会肆意赋予自己确保奶牛不宰杀或食用的权力。	Gau Rakshak Samitis, or “cow protection societies,” have been revived, and their members sometimes take it upon themselves to ensure that cows are not slaughtered or eaten.
兴奋剂的使用历史和兴奋剂的控制情况，在奥林匹克运动会上的表现是令人泄气的 - - 一个漏洞百出的大杂烩条例、毫无疑义的国家支持的欺骗、和半心半意不规则的执行情况。	The history of drugs, and drug control, at the Olympics is discouraging - a farrago of ill-informed rules, outright state-sponsored cheating, and half-hearted and erratic attempts at enforcement.
苹果iPod的主要操作芯片是由位于海德拉巴的PortalPlayer公司发明的，但是iPod本身是在中国制造的。	The key operating components of Apple’s iPod were invented by the Hyderabad company PortalPlayer, while the iPod itself are manufactured in China.
然而经济学家的共识是，过去三十年来，美国制造业就业的流失约有80％是由节约劳动力及提高生产率的技术变革导致的，而贸易的影响只能远远地屈居第二。	Among economists, however, the consensus is that about 80% of the loss in US manufacturing jobs over the last three decades was a result of labor-saving and productivity-enhancing technological change, with trade coming a distant second.
他借此在上个月军事政变失败后向批评他逮捕数千名包括众多新闻记者在内的所谓反对派的西方盟友传递了一条有力的消息 ： “ 我并不需要你们 。 ”	In doing so, he sent his Western allies – which have criticized the arrests of thousands of perceived opponents, including many journalists, following last month’s failed military coup – a powerful message: “I don’t need you.”
对欧洲来说，聆听东方的勾魂曲 — — 俄罗斯的战略实力和欧盟的经济实力互补的旋律 — — 就好比是向黑社会缴纳保护费。	For Europe, to heed the siren song from the East – a melody of complementarity between Russia’s strategic power and the EU’s economic power – would be akin to paying the Mafia for protection.
因为卡塔尔对美国具有重要的战略意义，卡塔尔和其他海湾国家之间爆发的外交冲突迫使美国国务卿蒂勒森进入到危机模式之中。	The diplomatic dispute between Qatar – a strategically important country to the US – and the other Gulf states sent US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson into crisis mode.
比如，到本世纪末，中东很多地方可能会变得太热而无法居住；而新德里等重污染城市可能会经历全年200多天气温超过35℃的日子。	Parts of the Middle East, for example, could become too hot for humans by the end of this century; and heavily populated cities such as New Delhi could experience temperatures over 95º Fahrenheit (35º C) up to 200 days out of the year.
而第二次世界大战后，富兰克林·罗斯福总统和哈里·杜鲁门总统 — — 以及世界各国的其他人 — — 在吸取教训后认为美国无法再次成为一个内向的国家。	After World War II, Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman – and others around the world – drew the lesson that the US could not afford to turn inward again.
把目前的救市资金盲目地投入到旧产业以及穷途末路的经济模式中就是浪费钱财并且把子孙后代的未来用作抵押。	Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children’s future.
如今，在美国和英国政坛 — — 事实上，是民主世界的几乎每���个角落 — — 有太多的“狂兽”环伺。	There are at the moment rather too many “rough beasts” around, in US and British politics alike – indeed, almost everywhere in the democratic world.
但ISDS步子迈得太大：补偿投资者预期利润的损失的义务可以并已经适用于规则没有歧视、利润来自公共伤害的领域。	But ISDS goes much further: The obligation to compensate investors for losses of expected profits can and has been applied even where rules are nondiscriminatory and profits are made from causing public harm.
如果薪酬差异是因为高技能工人相对供给增加而收窄，那么我们可以寄希望于拉丁美洲不平等程度的下降不会干扰增长加速（甚至可能是增长加速的早期信号 ） 。	If pay differentials have narrowed because of an increase in the relative supply of skilled workers, we can be hopeful that declining inequality in Latin America will not stand in the way of faster growth (and may even be an early indicator of it).
12月份的欧盟宪法条约投票结束了这一插曲。 它的通过表明了法国社会党有意识地接受了一种改革者的形象，一个社会民主的欧洲身份。	That December vote on the EU Constitutional Treaty closed this parenthesis: by approving of it, the Socialists consciously accepted a reformist, social democratic, European identity.
这些政权的样子，我们可以通过乔治·奥威尔的《1984 》 、 奥尔德斯·赫胥黎的《美丽新世界》以及米歇尔·维勒贝克（Michel Houellebecq）的最新小说《屈服 》 （ Submission）等文学作品一窥端倪。	The contours of such places have been reflected in literary work such as George Orwell’s 1984, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, and Michel Houellebecq’s latest novel Submission.
当美国官员对欧洲人说“我们需要你们”时，他们的意思是轻蔑的 ： “ 请不要在崩溃时把全球经济也拖下水 。 ”	When US officials say to the Europeans, “We need you,” what they mean is quite minimal: “Please do not collapse and bring down the global economy with you.”
同时科学数据无法传达的紧迫性也已经被地球本身所表现出来了 — — 通过肆虐的飓风，洪水，野火以及致命的干旱。	And, whatever urgency science cannot convey is being communicated by the planet itself – through a ferocious display of hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and deadly droughts.
面色苍白的男女影星、公司领袖和政坛人物已经少得可怜，这表明晒成褐色的皮肤代表着健康、财富和权力，而不再像过去那样象征劳动阶层的终日辛苦。	The dearth of pale actors, actresses, corporate leaders, and politicians confirms that a tan is identified with health, wealth, and power, rather than the travails of the working class, as in the past.
事实上，大学或许是长期资本投资领域效率最高的产品，特别是当我们把社会和经济“投资”放在同等条件下考量时更是如此。	Indeed, universities may be the most consistently performing products of long-term capital investment, especially if one is inclined to think about social and economic “investment” in exactly the same terms.
由联合国委员会提出的，更为重要的中期倡议里还有这样一条：创立全球性的经济协作理事会，该理事会不仅要协调经济政策，还会对面临的问题和机构之间的分歧进行评估。	One of the more important medium-term initiatives urged by the UN Commission is the creation of a global economic coordinating council, which would not only coordinate economic policy, but would also assess impending problems and institutional gaps.
比如，2003—2011年，土耳其的资本流入增加值接近GDP的8 % ， 这部分解释了70%的美元价格增幅。	For example, from 2003 to 2011, Turkey’s inflows increased by almost 8% of GDP, which partly explains the 70% increase in prices measured in dollars.
在政治、社会以及机制乱局中，以及冲突所留下的对人力和实物基础设施的巨大破坏的情况下，实现这一点就异常艰难。	In the midst of political, social, and institutional vulnerabilities, as well as the vast damage to human and physical infrastructure that are the legacy of conflict, this is a monumental task.
而最危险的情况也许是与世隔绝又不可预测的朝鲜政权正在金正恩冒进的暴力领导下变得比以往任何时候都更加不稳定。	And, perhaps most dangerous, the isolated and unpredictable North Korean regime is becoming more unstable than ever under the callow and violent leadership of Kim Jong-un.
显然，获得关于欧洲盟友决策的更深层次的分析洞见，而不是光靠给（比如）德国总理默克尔带电话获得消息，这符合美国的利益。	The US certainly has an interest in gaining deeper analytical insight into its European allies’ decision-making than can be gained by simply calling, say, German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
1968年的抗议要求法兰西共和国实现其最高的理想，而今天的危机则挑战法国大革命的公民资格和融入模式本身。	While the 1968 protests challenged the French Republican model to live up to its finest aspirations, today’s crisis challenges the French Revolution’s model of citizenship and integration itself.
圣地亚哥 — “ 什么样的国家配什么样的领导人 ， ” 法国反革命分子约瑟夫·德梅斯特尔（Joseph de Maistre）嘲讽道。	SANTIAGO – “Every country gets the leaders it deserves,” the French counter-revolutionary Joseph de Maistre quipped.
同时如果零售投资者发现原本投资的货币市场基金价值出现了下跌，如果他们知道自己无法迅速把自己的钱赎回来，那么这些基金的吸引力就会下降。	And, if retail investors saw their money-market funds’ values declining from the amount that they had invested, and if they knew that they could not get all of their money back immediately, the funds would become less attractive.
日本安全委员会（Security Council of Japan，在危机期间由相关内阁成员向首相提供建议的权宜性设置）将被重组为正式机构。	The Security Council of Japan – something of a stopgap measure created to provide advice from relevant cabinet members to the prime minister in times of crisis – will now be reorganized as a formal institution.
截至目前，这一做法是有效的，因为德国政府是一个庞大的净储蓄者，其2016年预算盈余达到了创纪录的237亿欧元。	This makes sense insofar as the German government is a massive net saver; the 2016 budget surplus was €23.7 billion, a record high.
我们现在已知特朗普与普京关系那份臭名昭著 “档案”中某些关键日期和细节已经得到证实，它们是由一位前英国情报官员负责搜集的。	We now know that some key dates and details in the infamous “dossier” on Trump’s relations with Putin, assembled by a former British intelligence officer, have been verified.
地球本身 — — 用圣方济各的话说，我们的姐妹大地（Mother Earth ） — —也无法容忍 。 ”	The earth itself – our sister, Mother Earth, as Saint Francis would say – also finds it intolerable.”
所有的东方社会都存在这一辩论，从而把我们带到了真正的文明冲突，也就是当今所有社会都分裂为西方化人士和非西方化人士。	Such a debate does take place within all Eastern societies, which leads us to the real clash of civilizations: all societies today are fragmented between Westernizers and non-Westernizers.
该投资基金将拨备50亿欧元的启动资金，其中部分来自以欧盟委员会160亿欧元担保为后盾对欧洲投资银行现有资产进行重估。	The EFSI will be equipped with €5 billion in start-up capital, produced through the revaluation of existing EIB assets, and will be backed by €16 billion in guarantees from the European Commission.
最顶端是创造一个开放、创新和充满活力的以市场为导向的全球经济 ， （ 原则上）所有国家都可以茁壮成长。	At the top was creating an open, innovative, and dynamic market-driven global economy, in which all countries can (in principal) thrive and grow.
极高的年轻人失业率 — — 在西班牙和希腊据信接近50 % ， 在整个欧元区超过20 % — —每天都能登上报纸标题。	Outrageously high youth unemployment – supposedly near 50% in Spain and Greece, and more than 20% in the eurozone as a whole – makes headlines daily.
但是，在“安全套主义”下，巴勒斯坦人和犹太人“将被赋予在两国任意土地上定居的权利，这两个国家将形成一个单一的双民族定居社会 。 ”	Under “condominialism,” however, both Palestinians and Jews “would be granted the right to settle anywhere within the territory of either of the two states, the two states thus forming a single, binational settlement community.”
此外，中国仍保持巨大的经常项目盈余，这与20世纪90年代末其他亚洲经济体纷纷出现大规模外部赤字截然不同。	Moreover, China continues to run a large current-account surplus, in contrast to the outsize external deficits that proved so problematic for other Asian economies in the late 1990s.
第三，我们需要对金融体系更好的监管，包括对不透明性或者像对冲基金甚至主权基金这样的高杠杆金融机构的监管。	Third, we need better supervision and regulation of the financial system, including regulation of opaque or highly leveraged financial institutions such as hedge funds and even sovereign wealth funds.
当回顾2008年来我所撰写的文章时，我发现自己有时也急于推进个人最喜欢的方法，而不顾可能给其他方法造成的损失。	When I look back at everything I have written since 2008, I find that I, too, have sometimes been too ready to push my favorite recipes at the expense of others.
这篇为她的新书《虎妈战歌》做宣传的文章一经发表就掀起了轩然大波，读者在华尔街日报网站上发表了4000多篇评论，Facebook上的回帖更是高达10万。 而该书也立刻跻身于畅销书之列。	The article was a promotional piece for Chua’s book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, which has become an instant bestseller.
这一点在金融市场监管问题上已经得到了证实；在数字经济监管框架上正在开始得到证实；在税收领域则正在得到证实。	This has been demonstrated in the context of financial-market regulation; it is starting to become clear with regard to the regulatory framework for the digital economy; and it is now being confirmed in the area of taxation.
对这一规模庞大且不断增长的需求源的高效的供给端响应要求诸多服务业的监管改革，包括金融、产品安全、交通和物流等方面。	An efficient supply-side response to this large and growing source of demand requires regulatory reform in many services, including finance, product safety, transport, and logistics.
对于萨科奇的重返北约的决定，除了那些经常存在的左右派系思维和那套经典的法式论调（民族主义，种族主义和大西洋主义）之外，我们或许还能看到某种可以被恰当地形容为这位总统的“三重赌注”的东西。	Beyond the often partisan and quintessentially French polemics about Sarkozy’s NATO decision, it is possible to discern what might best be termed a three-way wager by the French president.
因此产生的相关风险是加息太慢可能导致资产价格泡沫化以及其他所有风险 — — 信贷市场冻结，失业率骤升，消费下滑等等 — — 都是由于其不可避免的通货紧缩所引发的。	A related risk is that increasing rates too slowly could lead to an asset-price bubble and all the dangers – frozen credit markets, soaring unemployment, plummeting consumption, and more – implied by its inevitable deflation.
1492年征服美洲并实行殖民统治的欧洲人找到的并不是荒无人烟的广阔土地，这与他们自己的说法并不一致，相反，这里的土地上原来已经住着很多人，有些已经在这里生活了几千年之久。	The Europeans who conquered and colonized the Americas after 1492 did not find vast empty lands, as they sometimes proclaimed, but rather lands populated by communities dating back thousands of years.
正如20世纪40年代早期阿尔提艾罗·斯皮内利所说的那样，亲欧运动必须找到“不忽视民族情感、而是为其找到自由表达方式的解决办法 。 ”	As Altiero Spinelli put it in the early 1940s, the pro-Europe movement had to find “a solution that didn’t ignore national sentiments, but instead would offer a way for them to be manifested freely.”
近几年中，地方层面的示威 — — 示威对象包括糟糕的工作环境、非法采伐森林、掠夺土地、对环境或社会具有破坏作用的基础设施项目等 — — 层出不穷。	In recent years, local-level protests – opposing everything from poor working conditions to illegal logging, land grabs, and environmentally or socially damaging infrastructure projects – have proliferated.
当第一次提到沃尔福威茨领导当今世界最重要的发展银行候选人的时候，人们对于美国在伊拉克失败的设计师得到重赏感到不可思议。	When Wolfowitz’s name was first mentioned as a candidate to lead the world’s premier development bank, the idea that the architect of America’s failure in Iraq would be so rewarded was met by incredulity.
公共财政（在某些情况下，政府监管下的合作保险基金也等同于公共融资）为大多数医疗服务买单，私人保险只补充提供极少的额外服务。	Public finance (or, in some cases, government-regulated cooperative insurance funds that amount to public financing) pays for most discretionary medical services, with private insurance supplementing only minimal extra services.
当泡沫破灭后，欧洲央行试图通过使用印钞机并向投资者承诺无限保底来防止过高的价格回到均衡水平，而上述新措施也只是上述策略的翻版而已。	When the bubble burst, the ECB tried to prevent the excessive prices from returning to their equilibrium levels by using its printing press and promising unlimited coverage to investors. The latest ECB measures are just more of the same.
一般来说，爆发泰米尔猛虎组织这类冲突都是源自于社会和经济上的不满情绪，比如实际存在或感觉到的歧视，以及政府在充分解决财富和收入差距方面的无能。	Underlying wars such as the fight with the Tamil Tigers are, typically, social and economic grievances such as real or perceived discrimination, and the failure of government to address wealth and income disparities adequately.
它们不去报道突发新闻，而是炮制宣言，如Facebook创始人马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）所发表的5,700字的无病呻吟。	Instead of breaking stories, they took to drafting manifestos, like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s 5,700-word jeremiad about nothing in particular.
当一个具有分析能力、受过训练来努力探寻真理的头脑以及这样的一些人摆脱了自我怀疑，就可以做出令人惊叹的事情。	When an analytical mind, a mind that is trained to search rigorously for the truth and as part of a community of such people is set free from self-doubt, it can do amazing things.
但是，对无法进入国际资本市场的贫穷国家来说，它们没有选择，只能依靠世界银行和国际货币基金组织贷款来获得资金。	But poorer countries, for which international capital markets remain off limits, have no alternative but to rely on the World Bank and IMF.
雅罗斯拉夫·卡钦斯基和其他PiS党员认为俄罗斯 — — 在一些波兰官员的帮助下 — — 也要为坠机事件负责。	Jarosław Kaczyński and other PiS members maintain that Russia – with help from some Polish officials – was responsible for the plane crash, too.
希腊族塞浦路斯人领袖季米特里斯赫里斯托菲亚斯与土耳其族塞浦路斯人领袖麦赫迈特·阿里·塔拉特正在为达成协议而艰苦努力；但若没有进一步的协力推动，双方恐将与成功失之交臂。	The United Nations is in Cyprus to help however it can.UN Peacekeepers have stood watch for more than 45 years. My envoy, Alexander Downer, is facilitating the negotiations.
塞尔维亚总理（当时任总统）伊斯拉夫·科什图尼察2001年成立真相委员会的企图从一开始就被指控为缺乏公正，成立起来的真相委员会也不到一年就遭到解散的厄运。	Serbian Prime Minister (then President) Vojislav Kostunica’s attempt in 2001 to set up a truth commission was doomed from the outset by allegations of bias, and was disbanded within a year.
此外，解决一个层面的问题的措施，可能很容易影响到其他层面，这意味着不协调的匆忙决策可能造成消极的跨境后果。	Moreover, measures to address one dimension can easily affect the others, which means that uncoordinated and rash policy decisions can have negative consequences across the board.
老布什还尊重国内外制度和范式，要求美国国会授权参与海湾战争，要求联合国根据联合国宪章第七条给出决议。	Bush was also respectful of institutions and norms at home and abroad, going to the US Congress for authorization of the Gulf War, and to the United Nations for a resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.
但是，由于候选人需要受到由亲中派担任委员的非选举产生的委员会的仔细审查，实际上公民可以说完全没有选择。	But, given that candidates are to be carefully vetted by an unelected committee of pro-Chinese appointees, citizens would have no meaningful choice at all.
其他共和党人则会指责失业者，那些完全退出劳动力市场的人，或者那些想要工作但根本没法贡献什么价值的人 — — 所谓的“零边际产品劳动者 ” 。	Others blame the unemployed, those who have dropped out of the labor market altogether, or those who want to work but supposedly have nothing of value to contribute – the so-called “zero marginal product workers.”
希土之间的睦邻友好关系也为欧盟和土耳其之间建立更紧密的关系创建了一个框架。 作为一个进步政党，PASOK非常关注土耳其国内改革的进程。	Turkey’s governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) was elected on a pro-European platform, reflecting the public’s demand for modernization and democratization.
但当第十一章立足于保存破产公司的现有价值之时，国际救助机制的目标则恰恰相反，是保存那些破产金融机构的相对方的现有价值。	But, while the goal of Chapter 11 is to save the ongoing value of a firm, the goal of the international resolution mechanism should be to preserve the ongoing value of the counterparties of insolvent financial institutions.
幸运的是，越来越多的异口同声 — — 不仅来自公民社会团体，也来自国际组织 — — 已经燃起了一场终结贫困的全球运动。	Fortunately, a chorus of voices, not just from civil-society groups, but also from international organizations, has given rise to a global movement to end poverty.
欧盟委员会最近决定授予成员国在与欧洲结构性资金有关的富有成效的公共投资方面一定的自由，这是方向正确的一步。	The European Commission’s recent decision to grant member states some flexibility for productive public investment linked to EU structural funds is a welcome step in this direction.
但德国年轻人对大屠杀的记忆已经日渐模糊，再加上以色列国际形象的破坏，这些构成了两国“特殊”关系的官方定性的挑战。	But fading memories of the Holocaust among younger Germans, together with Israel’s declining international standing, have lately challenged the official discourse about “special” ties between the two countries.
也就是说，技术，而非贸易，才是21世纪经济的主题（当然，这两者相互影响，贸易刺激技术发展，推动技术传播，但这恐怕更多的是一种文字游戏 ） 。	That is, technology, not trade, was the big story of the twentieth-century economy (of course, the two interact, with trade helping to diffuse and stimulate technology, but this is a matter of semantics.)
香港—时至今日，已有充分的证据表明，不管是20世纪90年代的亚洲，还是十年后的美国和欧洲，金融系统都难逃崩溃的命运。	HONG KONG – Nowadays there is ample evidence that financial systems, whether in Asia in the 1990’s or a decade later in the United States and Europe, are vulnerable to breakdowns.
国家规定或劳资双方商定的安排降低了工作时长，增加了安全度，提高了家庭、医疗和其他福利，就业环境有了改善。	Employment conditions improved as state-mandated or negotiated arrangements led to reduced working hours, greater safety, and family, health, and other benefits.
但实际情况是上述举措能比一心一意专注于发表论文创造出更多现实的好处，过于关注论文发表可能会在不经意间为抄袭和垃圾科学创造土壤。	But the reality is that such efforts will produce more real-world benefits than a single-minded focus on publication, which can inadvertently encourage plagiarism and junk science.
这可以十分笨拙，约翰·克里（John Kerry）接受2004年民主党总统候选提名时便是如此，他的讲话将“价值”一词重复了32次。	This can be done clumsily, as when John Kerry accepted the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2004 with a speech that repeated the word “value” or “values” 32 times.
但现在西方兴起了一项令人不安的运动，试图告诉那些仍然享受不到电力带来的无数好处的人他们应当安于现状。	Yet there is a disturbing movement in the West to tell the 1.1 billion people who still lack these myriad benefits that they should go without.
接着，1958年苏联发射了史普尼克（Sputnik ） ， 显然，这意味着它很快就能对美国大陆发动核打击，美国的威慑效果就此打上了问号。	Then, in 1957, the launch of Sputnik made it clear that the Soviet Union would soon be able to deliver a nuclear strike on the US mainland, calling into question the effectiveness of American deterrence.
她希望得到一个强大的授权来“为英国争权益 ” ， 而这意味要与某份小报（以典型的脱欧派煽动性言词）所描述的国家利益“破坏者们”死磕。	She wants a strong mandate to “negotiate for Britain,” and that means crushing what one tabloid – in the typically incendiary rhetoric of Brexiteer populism – described as “saboteurs” of the national interest.
他认为美国总统应当不受美国宪法规定的平衡和限制措施的束缚，就好比他的国家也不应受到任何国际规则的约束。	He thought that the American president should operate beyond the checks and balances applied by the US Constitution, just as his country should not be constrained by any international rules.
但是，从2010年到2015年，记录为捐助金内支出的ODA占ODA总额的比重增加了两倍多，从2.7%增加到9.1 % 。	From 2010 to 2015, however, the share of total ODA reported as in-donor spending more than tripled, from 2.7% to 9.1%.
有趣的是，尽管这一下降趋势主要出现在特别倚重金融市场的发达经济体，但在两位作者所研究的95个国家中，几乎每一个都能察觉到这一变化。	What is interesting is that while this decline is most marked in advanced economies, which are especially dependent on financial markets, it is visible in virtually all of the 95 countries that the authors studied.
从圣主抵抗军在非洲中东部不分青红皂白的杀戮，到巴基斯坦塔利班针对基督徒的攻击，近期发生的事件表明偏见仍然在人们心中深深地根植。	And recent history – from the indiscriminate killings by the Lord’s Resistance Army in central and eastern Africa to the attacks against Christians by the Pakistani Taliban – shows that bigotry remains deeply embedded.
超低利率及量化宽松政策对低增长的发达经济体或许是恰当的举措，但对于正在奋力推行市场化价格发现机制的新兴经济体则可能问题重重。	Exceptionally low interest rates and quantitative easing may be appropriate for advanced economies experiencing slow growth, but they can be problematic for emerging economies struggling to promote market-oriented price-discovery mechanisms.
相反，他在Twitter上发布了一则视频，由他的外孙女用普通话朗诵中国古诗 — — 此举立刻打动了中国。	Instead, he posted on Twitter a video of his granddaughter reciting a poem in Mandarin – an instant hit in China.
社会民主党领导人弗兰茨·明特费林（Franz Müntefering）最近发起的一系列攻击使得人们对资本主义的新批评声达到了高潮。	This new critique of capitalism recently culminated in a series of attacks by the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Franz Müntefering.
你可以进一步了解特别报告员的工作，并访问Hilalelver.org查看她关于农场劳动者和粮食权问题的正式报告。	You can learn more about the work of the Special Rapporteur, and access her official report on agricultural workers and the right to food at Hilalelver.org.
国务卿蒂勒森最近主要站在外交立场上谈论这场危机，中央情报局局长麦克·蓬皮欧（Mike Pompeo）提到了推翻政权，而国家安全顾问麦卡斯特（H.R. McMaster）提出了采取预防性战争的可能性。	While Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s recent remarks on the crisis focused on diplomacy, CIA Director Mike Pompeo has mentioned regime change, and National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster has raised the possibility of a preventive war.
从前老一辈领导人需要做的，就是在支持巴解组织的各个阿拉伯国家之间搞好平衡，而如今新领导层的任务则是妥善处理同其对手哈马斯的关系，以便能顺利��以色列达成一个可行的妥协性协议。	While the old guard had to strike a balance between the different Arab countries that backed the PLO, the new guard will have to find a workable solution with their rivals in Hamas if a viable compromise agreement with Israel is to be found.
由于在苏黎世、迈阿密、伦敦以及其他地区的银行账户，发展中国家的富裕国民每年在自己的祖国逃避了超过1000亿美元的税款。	Wealthy citizens in the developing world evade more than $100 billion worth of taxes in their home countries each year, thanks to bank accounts in Zurich, Miami, London, and elsewhere.
与此同时，要减少蛇头船只上的人数，欧盟所承诺的安置人数应该远远多于目前所承诺的30,000叙利亚难民。	Meanwhile, in order to lighten smugglers' boats, the EU should commit to resettling many more than the 30,000 Syrian refugees it has pledged to accept thus far.
平心而论，埃维昂会议的参与者不可能预见到大屠杀或欧洲将发生又一场灾难性大战；尽管如此，他们的缺少良知仍然令人心碎。	To be sure, the participants in Évian could not have foreseen the Holocaust, or that Europe was being drawn into another devastating war; nonetheless, their lack of moral conscience was breathtaking.
当一家当地工厂因为一家企业决定将对应工序外包给跨境供应商而倒闭时，我们失去的东西可不仅仅是数百（或数千）个转移到海外的工作岗位。	When a local factory closes because a firm has decided to outsource to a supplier across the border, more is lost than the hundreds (or thousands) of jobs that move abroad.
11月17日，当民主党鹰派众议员、海军老兵约翰•默撒（John Murtha）提出在六个月内撤出伊拉克的建议时，这种僵持局面才开始得到缓和。	The ice began to crack on November 17, when Representative John Murtha, a hawkish Democratic congressman and marine veteran, suggested pulling troops out of Iraq in six months.
如果疾控中心的资金维持在正常水平，美国就可能提前派出训练有素的公共卫生人员而非作战部队，抗击埃博拉的效果也会更加明显。	Had CDC funding been at an appropriate level, US support – in the form of highly trained public health professionals, rather than ground troops – might have been deployed much earlier and been more effective.
最后，还有人说一旦允许种植转基因作物，农民便会便会沦为孟山都等大型种子商的附庸，而这些制造商大多拥有种子专利保护权，因此构成了垄断。 但是，即使将基因工程计算在内，私人公司也只占据农业研究的半壁江山。	Similarly, a large share of farmers – most of them smallholders – in Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, China, India, and other countries, prefer GM seed because they make more money from the resulting crops.
在放弃研发核武器以换取实现与美国和全球关系正常化之后，卡扎菲的下场是恐怖的死亡（死时他受尽刺刀的折磨 ） 。	After abandoning his quest for nuclear weapons in exchange for normalization of relations with the US and the world, Qaddafi died a horrible death (during which he was tortured and sodomized with a bayonet).
他当时的当选票数仅有38 % ， 未能在议会两院占据任何多数，而且首都墨西哥城还落入了反对派的控制。	He was elected with just 38% of the vote, without a majority in either house of Congress, and with the opposition in control of Mexico City, the capital.
国企可能在银行信用、自然资源和土地方面享有特权，但它们也受到僵化的治理结构和反腐带来的大规模人事流动的困扰。	SOEs may enjoy privileged access to bank credit, natural resources, and land, but they also suffer from rigid governance and high staff turnover, spurred by President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign.
尽管俄国已成功进入世界杯淘汰赛，但激烈的竞争和俄罗斯成功的高度不确定性导致俄罗斯很可能成为一颗转瞬即逝的流星。	And yet, while Russia has made it through to the tournament’s knockout round, the excitement of the games, and the unlikeliness of Russia’s success, amount to a fleeting distraction.
国际货币基金组织（IMF）必须同意欧元集团关于如何重建希腊债务可持续性（这是希腊重回资本市场的先决条件）的建议。	And the International Monetary Fund must agree with the Eurogroup on how to restore debt sustainability in Greece, a precondition for the country to regain access to capital markets.
但是它的某些核能力会被保留下来，而它的核计划会在未来数年以一种使二次打击变得更加困难的方式得以重建。	But some capability would likely survive, and the nuclear program could be rebuilt over several years in a manner that would make a second attack much more difficult.
最能体现这种道德主义的利弊的邦要数喀拉拉，2014年，喀拉拉邦宣布对酒精销售实施局部禁令，并计划在十年后全民禁酒。	The state that best illustrates the appeal and the pitfalls of such moralism is Kerala, which announced in 2014 that it was implementing a partial ban on the sale of alcohol, with the goal of achieving total prohibition in ten years.
令安格尔倍感困惑的是：一次大战前泛德联盟的政治家为什么会认定德国的繁荣需要庞大的军事力量作后盾，而军力的薄弱并未影响到挪威、丹麦或荷兰等国保持繁荣昌盛。	Angell puzzled over how pre-WWI pan-German politicians could believe that German prosperity required a big battle fleet when the absence of one made no difference to the prosperity of Norway, Denmark, or Holland.
通常，在发生类似事件后，朝鲜事总是对此闭口不谈。 “失败”在朝鲜的政治词典中是不存在的，因此也不能提及或者讨论。	North Korea typically goes silent after such episodes: “failure” does not exist in its political lexicon, so it cannot be reported or discussed.
事实上，英国首相卡梅伦在2010年访问印度时明确宣布，克西努尔必须“原封不动 ” ， 因为“如果你想一个人说了‘是 ’ ， 你就会突然发现，大英博物馆将被掏空 。 ”	Indeed, on a 2010 visit to India, Prime Minister David Cameron declared outright that the Kohinoor would have to “stay put,” because “if you say yes to one, you would suddenly find the British Museum would be empty.”
南非竞争委员会主席特姆宾柯西·博纳科勒（Tembinkosi Bonakele）在去年指出，政府“决心杜绝卡特尔剥削消费者的现象 ， ” 特别是在粮食行业。	As Tembinkosi Bonakele, head of South Africa’s Competition Commission, noted last year, the government is “determined to root out exploitation of consumers by cartels,” especially in the food industry.
也有人在官方的半鼓励下主张所有科学发现和成就 — — 包括飞机和原子武器 — — 都是在吠陀时代的印度实现的。	Others assert, with some level of official encouragement, that every scientific discovery or achievement – including jet aircraft and atomic weaponry – was made in India during the Vedic age.
2014年，中国、埃及、委内瑞拉和阿尔及利亚的化石燃料补贴高达200—300亿美元；俄罗斯和印度为400亿美元；伊朗和沙特阿拉伯为700亿美元。	In 2014, spending on fossil-fuel subsidies amounted to $20-30 billion in China, Egypt, Venezuela, and Algeria; $40 billion in Russia and India; and $70 billion in Iran and Saudi Arabia.
中央银行（中国人民银行）一开始把这归咎于流动性过剩，于是开始动用货币政策工具，从2007年下半年起它连续五次提高了利率。	The central bank (PBOC) initially attributed it to excess liquidity, and so began to use monetary policy tools, raising interest rates five times since late 2007.
但正如美国在波斯尼亚战争临近结束时采取“先轰炸后和谈”的策略一样，美国也必须愿意在伊朗问题上“先制裁后谈判 ” ， 从而为争取最终外交解决创造更多的空间。	Yet, just as the US adopted a “bomb and talk” approach with the Serbs during the dénouement of the Bosnian war, America must be willing to “sanction and talk” when it comes to Iran, thereby creating greater space for an eventual diplomatic strategy.
但是，随着埃及国内政坛渐稳，自2011年1月以来一直不得不对对埃及关系以及西奈半岛问题实行软处理的以色列在未来将不得不更加小心翼翼地采取行动。	But, as Egypt’s domestic politics take their course, Israel, which has had to tread softly in its relationship with Egypt and in Sinai since January 2011, will have to behave with even greater sensitivity in the days ahead.
但是，正如普林斯顿大学经济学家迪克西特（Avinash Dixit）常说的，世界充其量只能是次优的。 假设我们能够识别和直接监督问题行为的观点是不现实的。	But, as Princeton economist Avinash Dixit likes to say, the world is always second-best at best. An approach that presumes that we can identify and directly regulate problematic behavior is unrealistic.
几乎在五年前，当布什总统在瓜纳华托拜访福克斯总统的时候承诺与墨西哥签订一项移民协议以来，他一直就躲避这个问题。	President George W. Bush has been skirting the question ever since he committed himself to an immigration agreement with Mexico when he visited President Vicente Fox in Guanajuato almost exactly five years ago.
中国和印度追求与它们的经济实力相称的全球影响力；巴西和南非正在崛起为洲级大国，而以碳氢化合物为底气的俄罗斯也不满于它在西方体系中的边缘地位。	China and India are seeking global influence commensurate with their economic weight; Brazil and South Africa are emerging as continental powerhouses, and hydrocarbon-fueled Russia is chafing at its status on the margins of the Western system.
他发现，在正式部门，本地人工作岗位在难民涌入后事实上是增加的，这显然是拜难民流入对地区经济的刺激效应所赐。	He found that in the formal sector, jobs for locals actually increased after the influx of refugees, apparently because of the stimulative effect on the region’s economy.
作为7月发布的美国国民收入和产出账户年度修订工作的一部分，美国商务部统计学家将调低了他们此前对消费支出的估计。	As part of the annual reworking of the US National Income and Product Accounts that was released in July 2011, Commerce Department statisticians slashed their earlier estimates of consumer spending.
本周，阿布扎比将召开抵达最后一英里（Reaching the Last Mile）论坛，200多位疾病防治方面的领导者将齐聚一堂。 我们希望借此可以进一步推动全球合作。	We hope to encourage further global collaboration this week, as Abu Dhabi convenes more than 200 leaders in disease eradication at a forum called Reaching the Last Mile.
在美国，食品和药品监督局（Food and Drug Administration）可以禁止非治疗用途的抗生素。	In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration could ban the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics.
在包括欧洲的许多发达国家中，以“就业”为首的一系列社会关系的动荡对于越来越多的人来说正慢慢变得不可忍受。	The general instability of social relations – most importantly, but not only, of employment – is slowly becoming intolerable for a growing part of the population in many developed countries, not just in Europe.
名人 — — 事实上普通人也是如此 — — 在私下里做的事情对媒体报道没有限制，只有在他们允许这些行为被报道、拍摄或录像的情况下才可以。	What famous people – indeed ordinary people, too – do in private should be off limits to the media unless they give permission for those activities to be reported, photographed, or filmed.
这难免会触发一些违约并影响银行的贷款组合质量，但这些努力和成本是值得的，会对中国实现更平衡、更健康的经济发展做出重大贡献。	While this will inevitably trigger some defaults and erode the quality of banks’ loan portfolios, the end result – a more balanced and healthy economy – will be more than worth it.
埃及政府需要维持稳定的外国融资,以支撑整个国家,并以此来平衡国际上对穆尔西施行的有违埃及基本人权 的措施的反对之声。	Egypt’s government needs to secure consistent foreign financing to keep the country afloat, providing leverage for international opposition to Morsi’s efforts to impose an agenda that runs contrary to Egyptians’ fundamental rights.
西北大学 (Northwestern University)的罗伯特 • 戈登 (Robert Gordon)解释原因说，尽管现代科技带来了发展的动力，但生产率增长不断放缓已经拖累了这些富裕经济体的增长潜力。	Global growth this year will be closer to 3%, with rising financial tensions in Europe.
毕竟，当刘在2010年被授予诺贝尔奖以及被激怒的中国试图惩罚挪威时，西方并没有表达愤怒，也没有展现出与北约盟友的真正团结。	After all, when Liu was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010, and an infuriated China attempted to ostracize Norway, the West did not express outrage or display real solidarity with a NATO ally.
韩国决策者预见到随之而来的挑战，着力强化土地评估定价机制，培养评估干部确保评估透明度，并公开土地评估信息。	South Korean policymakers, anticipating the challenges, strengthened institutions for valuing and pricing land, trained a cadre of appraisers to ensure transparency in the valuation process, and publicly disseminated land-value information.
因此，在供给面因素不再能够驱动全球增长的情况下，我们必须重估我们队货币和财政政策所能实现的效果的预期。	Thus, with supply-side factors no longer driving global growth, we must reassess our expectations of what monetary and fiscal policies can achieve.
甚至连最大、最有活力的新兴经济体中国，去年增长率也达到了1990年（6.9 % ） 以来的最低水平，预计今年减速之势还会加剧。	Even China, the largest and most dynamic emerging economy, recorded its lowest growth rate since 1990 (6.9%) last year, and the slowdown is forecast to accelerate this year.
但最近一段时间，欧洲和美国的经济窘境吸引了人们的目光，以至于许多事关亚洲能否持续保持成功的严峻挑战都被忽视了。	But the current focus on economic malaise in Europe and the United States is distracting attention from the many serious challenges that call into question Asia’s continued success.
奥巴马还应该支持印度加入关键的核不扩散组织，如核供应国集团（Nuclear Suppliers Group）和导弹及其技术控制制度（Missile Technology Control Regime ） 。	Obama should also support India’s membership in key non-proliferation organizations like the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime.
此外，在海曼·明斯基（Hyman Minsky）所描述的枯荣循环中，低波动时期诱使投资者产生错误地安全感，导致他们过度举债，最终引发崩盘。	Moreover, in the boom-bust cycle described by Hyman Minsky, a period of low volatility lulls investors into a false sense of security, leading them to become over-leveraged and ultimately producing a crash.
除了缓解债务问题之外，短期内发生温和通胀能降低住房的真实（调整通胀后）价值，使房地产市场更容易稳定下来。	In addition to tempering debt problems, a short burst of moderate inflation would reduce the real (inflation-adjusted) value of residential real estate, making it easier for that market to stabilize.
塔法雅风电场拥有131个风机涡轮，日发电能力超300百万瓦，可以让摩洛哥每年减少二氧化碳排放量900,000吨，并节约1.9亿美元以上的石油进口资金。	With 131 turbines and a daily capacity of more than 300 MW, Tarfaya will help reduce Morocco’s carbon dioxide emissions by 900,000 tons annually, and cut the country’s annual oil import bill by more than $190 million.
毕竟，叙利亚是地中海的一个战略要点；与以色列、约旦、土耳其和伊拉克接壤；并且与伊拉克一样，也存在桀骜难驯的库尔德少数民族。	After all, Syria is strategically perched on the Mediterranean; shares borders with Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq; and, like Iraq, has its own restive Kurdish minority.
最显著的例子与2013年7月的政变有关，当时埃及警方和军方向开罗拉巴广场（Rab’a Square）反对推翻穆尔西的群众开火，在不到十小时时间内有超过1,000示威者被杀。	The most dramatic of these episodes accompanied the coup in July 2013, when Egyptian police and army opened fire on crowds protesting Morsi’s ouster in Cairo’s Rab’a Square, killing more than 1,000 protesters in less than ten hours.
但我认为这个问题可以轻而易举地解决，比如允许世界银行持有富国债券，并允许它自由支配由此产生的利息收入。	But I believe that the problem could easily be solved by, say, giving the World Bank an endowment of rich-country bonds and permitting it to expend the interest.
在米苏拉塔（Misrata ） ， JCP最终位列第二，仅次于当地的家乡党联盟（Union for Homeland Party ） ， 得票数是位列第四的NFC的近三倍。	In Misrata, the JCP finished second, after the local Union for Homeland Party, but still managed to win almost three times as many votes as the NFC, which came in fourth.
问题在于老欧洲党派的知识和道德基础在最近几年快速削弱，部分原因在于它们没能 — — 或无力 — — 适应欧洲层面的制度。	The problem is that the old European parties’ intellectual and moral foundations have rapidly eroded in recent years, owing partly to their failure – or inability – to adapt to EU-level systems.
我们所有的药物能够帮助中止工作的患者继续工作。 他们为了避免引发恐惧或焦虑的状况，比如拥挤的地铁或受到同行或上司评议而无法继续工作。	The drugs we have can help patients who, in order to avoid situations that inspire fear or anxiety, such as crowded subways or being judged by their peers or superiors, have stopped going to work.
但对施罗德受雇于该公司的正当性的严肃调查却从来没有启动过，这可能是受制于德俄两国经济关系的范围和严重性。	But no serious investigation of the propriety of Schröder’s dealings was ever launched, perhaps because of the scale and importance of German-Russian economic ties.
纳伊夫（担任内政部长37年）于2012年6月逝世，随后阿卜杜拉撤消了阿卜杜勒·拉曼（Abdul Rahman，苏德里七兄弟之一）的王储地位，替之以萨尔曼（Salman ） 。	Following the death of Naif (who was Minister of Interior for 37 years) in June 2012, he removed Abdul Rahman, a Sudeiri, and appointed Salman as Crown Prince.
圆桌会议发表了一项重要的原则声明以及一项篇幅更长的总体声明。 世界上最大的企业，包括那些位于美国、欧洲、加拿大、中国以及印度等国的企业都签署了这一声明。	The Roundtable produced an important Statement of Principles and a longer overall statement that has been signed by many of the world’s largest businesses, including those based in the US, Europe, Canada, China, and India.
这些票仓选民不会反对非国大党，因此，非国大党的选举主宰地位不会受到生存威胁，这也构成了阻碍改革措施的力量。	These voters are unlikely to turn against the party, thus buffering any existential threat to its dominance at the ballot box and putting a damper on reform efforts.
我和英国克雅氏病调查局的同事们认为，这种新形式的人类朊病毒疾病很可能与感染牛海绵状脑病因子或食用感染致病因子的肉制品有关。	My colleagues and I in NCJDSU argued that this new form of human prion disease was likely to be linked to exposure to the BSE agent, probably by eating BSE-infected meat products.
不先断绝独立的资金来源，就根本不可能压制独立的政治家和媒体，这也是普京领导的克里姆林宫集中全力打击所谓“寡头政治”的原因所在。	It is impossible to silence independent politicians and independent media without choking off independent sources of money, which is why Putin’s Kremlin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called “oligarchs.”
在此我认为有三个因素能大概解释经济学家集体出错的原因：高度专业化，预测的难度，以及大部分经济学科与现实的脱节。	I would argue that three factors largely explain our collective failure: specialization, the difficulty of forecasting, and the disengagement of much of the profession from the real world.
在弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)总统的领导下，俄国的国家复兴和全新自信并不是俄国闭门造车的产物，而是真实地反应了俄国所处的顺利的国际环境。	Russia’s national revival and new assertiveness under President Vladimir Putin is not really home made but reflects highly auspicious international conditions.
我们为可持续发展定义了六个全球目标：生活和生活方式、食品安全、水的可持续性、清洁能源、健康的生态系统和良好的治理。	We identified six universal goals for sustainable development: lives and livelihoods, food security, water sustainability, clean energy, healthy ecosystems, and good governance.
宪法规定的和平主义乃是美国占领日本期间所施加的战后秩序的一部分，并受到绝大部分厌恶战争的日本人的支持。	Constitutional pacifism was part of the postwar order imposed by the United States during occupation and largely supported by the Japanese people, who were tired of war.
事实上，不久到来的中国领导人换届选举中，两个最高领导人的位置已经被选定，这一决定只是通过大约至多100人选举过程产生，而这一过程只是例行公事罢了，记住这一点尤为重要。	Indeed, it is important to bear in mind that, ahead of the upcoming Chinese leadership transition, new occupants for only the top two posts have been chosen, and that through a process of gradual anointment by roughly a hundred people at most.
没有获得批准的措施只不过是把此前美国的承诺从补充性账户转移到IMF的核心融资源，几乎不会给纳税人造成任何成本。	The failed measure involved only a transfer of previous US commitments from a supplementary account to the IMF’s core funding source, at virtually no cost to taxpayers.
英国和法国在大力宣传间接军事干预：向叛军供应武器。 在它们看来，这是低成本、低风险、高潜在回报的选择。	The United Kingdom and France are pressing hard for indirect military intervention: supplying arms to the rebel side, in their view, would be a low-cost, low-risk, potentially high-return option.
信任需要多年时间才能建立，但只要有一家银行不恪守职业道德、价值低迷、行为错误，信任就会在一夜之间毁于一旦。	But while trust takes years to establish, it can be squandered abruptly if a particular bank’s ethics are weak, its values poor, and its behavior simply wrong.
地缘政治风险也很高 — — 事实上，历史上地缘政治风险很少有和现在那么高的时候，正如美国全球领导力的稳定作用很少有和现在那么低的时候。	Geopolitical risk is also high – indeed, it has rarely been higher than it is today, just as faith in the stabilizing influence of US global leadership has rarely been lower.
比如，自1946年以来俄罗斯共100多次行使否决权 — — 其中2011年以来的最近四次都是生气地驳回试图停止叙利亚大屠杀的决议。	Russia, for example, has exercised vetoes more than 100 times since 1946, most recently – and unhappily – four times since 2011 to block resolutions intended to halt the carnage in Syria.
成本的绝大部分来自开始阶段，产生于硬件（如传感器）设计以及（更重要的）开发有能力处理各种任务的软件的过程中。	The vast majority of the cost comes at the start, in the design of hardware (like sensors) and, more important, in creating the software that produces the capability to carry out various tasks.
所有美军指挥官都明白如果没法一次过消灭朝鲜的所有核武器，就可能引发一场夺去数百万人生命的区域（甚至是核）战争。	As US military commanders well know, strikes that failed to eliminate all of North Korea’s nuclear weapons at once could trigger a regional – or even a nuclear – war costing millions of lives.
有多少学生倒在枪口下或者有多少科学证据证明二氧化碳排放的影响并不重要，人类不会改变决定了他们的身份的信念。	No matter how many schoolchildren are gunned down or what the scientific evidence may be for the effects of carbon dioxide emissions, people will not change beliefs that define their identity.
但是，如果该地区的国家要防止也门民众的进一步激进化，它们就需要将也门的民众融入一个可以为他们的未来带来希望的经济区域。	But if Yemen’s masses are not to become more radicalized, they will need to be incorporated into an economic zone that offers hope for the future.
据科学家里克·希德（Rick Heede）2013年的一项研究，18世纪50年代以来可追踪二氧化碳排放量的近三分之二来自90个最大的化石燃料和水泥生产实体，其中大部分至今仍在营业。	According to a 2013 study by the scientist Rick Heede, nearly two-thirds of carbon dioxide emitted since the 1750s can be traced to just 90 of the largest fossil fuel- and cement-producing entities, most of which still operate.
对于大萧条，你也许会好奇高EPU值是否与20世纪20年代的过剩之后的社会趋势有关，它助长了对共产主义以及（在美国）对新政的担忧。	As for the Great Depression, one wonders if the high degree of EPU was linked to social trends after the excesses of the 1920s, fueling fear of Communism and, in the United States, of the New Deal.
尽管中国的房地产市场已经出现了转弱的迹象¾比如上海的房价就在下跌¾但绝大多数城市的房价上涨仍然风头正劲。	In China, despite some signs of weakness – the Shanghai market is down, for example – price growth is still robust in much of the country.
G-7领导人在最近的联合声明承诺解决“抗生素耐药性 ” （ AMR ） ， 包含面更广的G-20 — — 以及首次担任其主席国的中国 — — 应该担起下一阶段战斗的领导责任。	With the G-7 leaders having committed, in a recent joint declaration, to tackle “antimicrobial resistance” (AMR), it is time for the more inclusive G-20 – and China, as it chairs the group for the first time – to take the fight to the next level.
这是马萨诸塞大学的萨姆·鲍尔斯（Sam Bowles）教授在20年前首先向南非劳动力市场委员会提出的，至今仍然是解决种族隔离制度结构性失业遗毒的最具说服力的，以市场为导向的选择。	Originally proposed by Professor Sam Bowles of the University of Massachusetts to South Africa’s labor market commission 20 years ago, this remains the most compelling market-based option for addressing apartheid’s structural legacy of unemployment.
IMF以此表明对人民币继续崛起的信心，也增强了人民币迈向国际化的全球预期 — — 并给与了间接支持。	By demonstrating its confidence in the renminbi’s continued rise, the IMF has reinforced global expectations of – and lent implicit support to – the renminbi’s progress toward internationalization.
在传统并信奉宗教的社会中新兴的女权主义核心理论与西方的女权主义差别很大 — — 从某种角度来讲前者的人性化和深刻程度远远超过了后者。	The core theory with which emerging feminists in more traditional and religious societies are working is far different from that of Western feminism – and in some ways far more profound and humane.
事实上，荷兰一家业界领先的金融报就攻击说，这一预先宣告是特里歇 弱点的象征，而非其实力的标志，暗示特里歇已经失去了对管理委员会的控制。	Indeed, a leading Dutch financial newspaper attacked the pre-announcement as a sign of Trichet’s weakness rather than strength, implying that he had lost control of the Governing Council.
即使在表现出色的国家，工业化也在以比以前的赶超增长例子快得多的速度失去动力 — — 我将这一现象称为早夭的工业化（premature deindustrialization ） 。	Even in countries that are doing well, industrialization is running out of steam much faster than it did in previous episodes of catch-up growth – a phenomenon that I have called premature deindustrialization.
It was, of course, nice that world leaders could agree that it would be bad to risk the devastation that could be wrought by an increase in global temperatures of more than two degrees Celsius.	It was, of course, nice that world leaders could agree that it would be bad to risk the devastation that could be wrought by an increase in global temperatures of more than two degrees Celsius.
至少在民主社会，应当向公众解释清楚这样的政策，而疾病分类，由于它应用于公共政策中的诸多职能，也应该如此。	At least in democratic societies, such policies should be accountable to the public, and the classification of diseases, since it serves many of the functions of public policy should be no different.
自称“伊斯兰自由派”的伊亚德·巴格达迪（Iyad El-Baghdadi）在Tweet上评论了这些游行的强度，他恰当地指出 ： “ 无悔意的仇恨到处都在成为主流。	Commenting on the intensity of these protests, Iyad El-Baghdadi, a self-described “Islamic libertarian,” aptly tweeted: “Unapologetic hatred is going mainstream everywhere.
多年来我一直指出，除非在全球许多国家（尤其是美国）日益严重的不平等问题得到解决，否则必将产生某些政治后果。	I had been writing for years that unless growing inequality – especially in the US, but also in many countries throughout the world – was addressed, there would be political consequences.
埃塞俄比亚的发展潜力与季节性降雨密切相关，因此，极大的雨量变化和基础设施缺乏已经阻碍了发展，造成了持久的贫困。	Ethiopia’s development potential is closely tied to seasonal rains, so high rainfall variation, together with lack of infrastructure, has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty.
世界货币基金组织的成员国都不信该组织能承担全球中央银行的重任，因此为特别提款权的创设设置了极高的门槛。	Because they did not trust the IMF to assume the powers of a global central bank, the Fund’s members established high hurdles to creating SDRs.
显然，一些国家达到了相当完美的平衡，以相对较低的支出解决了暴力问题；因此降低不必要的开支的办法是有的。	Certainly, a few countries have struck a fair balance, addressing violence for a relatively small outlay; so there are ways to reduce unnecessary expenditure.
令人遗憾的是，签订有约束力的国际条约限制非战争情况下攻击性网络武器的研发和使用可能还有很长的路要走。	Unfortunately, a binding international agreement to restrict the development and use of offensive cyber weapons in non-war situations is probably a long way off.
的确，这里边的逻辑是不证自明的：随着更多的外汇流入这个市场，经济将继续过热，从而使进一步调高利率成为必然。	Indeed, the logic is self-fulfilling: as more foreign currency flows into the market, the economy will continue to overheat, necessitating further interest rate hikes.
加沙 — — 巴勒斯坦主席阿巴斯已经以个人身份向联合国秘书长潘基文递交了巴勒斯坦成为联合国完全会员国的动议。	GAZA CITY – Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has now personally presented Palestine’s bid for full United Nations membership to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.
普京这番话的弦外之音是“基督教能源 ” ， 甚至是“东正教”的，都会比“穆斯林能源”更让在中东稳定问题上神经过敏的西方世界放心。	Putin’s implicit point was that “Christian energy,” even if “Orthodox,” would be more reassuringly certain than “Muslim energy” for a Western world jittery about stability in the Middle East.
1989—1991年间的一系列历史性事件永久地改变了欧洲，此后，我们所有人都从政府内外参与到了欧洲-大西洋安全中。	Ever since the historic events of 1989-1991 changed Europe forever, each of us has been involved in Euro-Atlantic security, both inside and outside of government.
一些妇女权利倡导者支持将传播艾滋病毒刑事化的法律，认为这些法律将严惩向性伴侣包括他们的妻子和女朋友隐瞒自己感染了艾滋病毒的男子。	And some women’s rights advocates have supported laws that criminalize transmitting HIV, arguing that these laws would punish men who concealed their HIV-positive status from their sexual partners, including their wives and girlfriends.
而重元素之所以中拥有如此巨大的能量，就是因为其内部储存了超新星爆发时所释放出来的一小部分能量，要知道正是这种能量在大约50亿年前创造了地球和整个太阳系。	Heavy elements contain so much energy because they stored a fraction of the energy released in the supernova explosion that created our Earth and the solar system around five billion years ago.amp#160;
随着本月大宪章800周年纪念日的到来，斯诺登泄密事件也推动了确立隐私、言论自由和负责任匿名等原则的新一轮互联网“权利法案” 起草运动。	With the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta this month, Snowden’s revelations have also fueled a new movement to create country-specific Internet “bills of rights” establishing the principles of privacy, free speech, and responsible anonymity.
这门科学的支持者炮制了一个幻觉：可以设法人造一条气候危机的出路，实现2015年巴黎气候协定目标，同时又维持重消费生活方式。	Proponents of this science feed the illusion that there is a way to engineer an exit from the climate crisis, meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and maintain a consumption-heavy lifestyle.
美国最高法院法官肯尼迪在其布梅迪艾内诉布什一案中的多数意见中写到 ： “ 自由和安全可以两全；在美国的体制中这二者在法律的框架内得以两全 ” 。	In the majority opinion in Boumediene v. Bush , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that “Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law.”
如果缺少这一社会粘合剂 — — 如同以色列人和巴勒斯坦人 — — 人们就无法利用所有可获得的经济机会。	Where this social glue is lacking – such as between Israelis and Palestinians – people cannot exploit all of the available economic opportunities.
但令人吃惊的是，即便这些政策获得了如此高的成就和支持度，选民们却选出了令许多智利人至今担心会动摇这一政策的总统和议会。	So, given the success and popularity of these policies, it is surprising that Chile’s voters have elected a president and a parliament that many Chileans now fear could put this approach at risk.
但历史告诉我们一个更加简单的解释：十年来石油价格的稳步上涨培养了俄罗斯的野心，使它准备抓住一切机会部署其军事力量。	But history suggests a simpler explanation: A decade of steadily rising oil prices had emboldened Russia, leaving it ready to seize any opportunity to deploy its military power.
要不是考虑到一个事实 — — 极低利率助长了借款人和渴望高收益的贷款人的冒险行为 — — 所有这些都不重要。	None of this might matter were it not for the fact that extremely low interest rates have fueled increased risk-taking by borrowers and yield-hungry lenders.
而由于产品价格的升高，消费者自然也会因此减少购买这些产品，转而购买那些排放二氧化碳较少的产品和服务。	Consumers would respond to the tax-induced increase in the cost of the emissions-intensive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amounts of CO2 emissions.
第四大行动方，即西奈圣战者，主要由贝多因人组成，他们的血统与埃及人大相径庭，且长期遭遇边缘化待遇，这使得他们当中一些人加入了激进伊斯兰主义集团（同时在阿拉伯半岛活动 ） 。	The fourth actor, the Sinai jihadis, comprises primarily Bedouins, whose distinct origins and long-time marginalization have led some to identify with radical Islamist groups (often while working in the Arabian Peninsula).
三大反对党领袖组成的反对派“自由”联盟已经宣布，如果选举结果中反对派所获票数低于70 % ， 他们就会认定该结果弄虚作假，而后他们将上街游行。	The leaders of the three-party opposition bloc Azadlyg (Freedom) have declared that they will regard any electoral outcome that gives opposition parties less than 70% of the vote as having been falsified, and that street protests would follow.
反应中，这些元素的原子核通常会裂变成两个较小的原子核以及两三个中子，并释放出比任何化学反应都大几百万倍的能量。	The nuclei of their atoms usually decay into two smaller nuclei and a couple of neutrons, releasing many million times more energy than any chemical process ever could.
辛普森－鲍尔斯及多梅尼西－���夫林无党派税收政策中心对赤字削减计划的分析证实这种方法从数学角度看具有可行性。	Analysis of the Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin deficit-reduction plans by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center confirms that this approach is arithmetically feasible.
在一方面，小国卢森堡老牌首相容克尔是一个稳妥的侯选人。 他对欧盟的政治机器了如指掌，而且主持欧元区的部长会议。	On the one hand, there’s the safe pair of hands personified by Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran prime minister of tiny Luxembourg, who knows the ins and outs of the EU’s political machinery and chairs the euro zone’s ministerial set-up.
米洛塞维奇死后，卡拉季奇以及姆拉季奇都应该送交前南国际刑事法庭，这样做不仅会加强其工作，而且向他们的受害者表明，国际社会决心不让他们的痛苦被人遗忘。	In the wake of Milosevic’s death, Karadzic and Mladic should be brought before the ICTY, both to reinforce its work and to demonstrate to their victims that the international community is resolved not to allow their suffering to be forgotten.
日内瓦第四公约规定，在被占领国家保护平民的责任属于占领军。 在这一情况下，美军明显没有保护伊拉克妇女。	Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, the responsibility for protecting civilian populations in an occupied country belongs to the occupying forces, which, in this case, are clearly failing to protect Iraqi women.
对南非年轻妇女来说，这些教材提供了与性和生殖健康相关的问题的救命信息，包括生育控制、性暴力和我国的进步的堕胎法律。	For young South African women, these texts offer life-saving information about issues related to sexual and reproductive health – including birth control, sexual violence, and our country’s progressive abortion law.
国际社会向来认为，贸易战是对全球贸易体系的直接威胁，因此只能用作最后手段（并常常通过多边机构使用 ） 。	The international community has long agreed that trade wars pose a direct threat to the global trading system, and thus should be used only as a measure of last resort (and usually through multilateral institutions).
但过去二十年的经验证明，这些指导对于解决存在技术、社会和政治复杂性的真实世界经济发展问题来说几乎毫无实践意义。	But experience over two decades shows that such directives provide little practical guidance for solving the technically, socially, and politically complex real-world problems of economic development.
电脑屏幕上的画面是令人震惊的：一个男人，躺在医院的病床上，他的头上绑着绷带，血不断地从他的头顶上淌下来。	The image on the computer screen is shocking: a man, lying on a hospital bed, his head bandaged, with long trickles of blood running from the top of his scalp.
它们不去通过（比如）效仿BuzzFeed进行创新。 BuzzFeed曾经是臭名昭著的“骗点击”工厂，后来它迅速演变成严肃的报道和长篇新闻网站。	They did not innovate by, for example, following the lead of BuzzFeed, a once-notorious “clickbait” factory that soon expanded into serious reportage and long-form journalism.
和美国以及一些欧洲国家面临的巨额债务相比，甚至连政府的赤字开支—长久以来这一直是非洲的祸害—似乎也完全是微不足道的。	Even government deficit spending – long the bane of Africa – seems positively puny compared to the massive debts that the US and some European countries face.
如今，我们面临一个在已有成就的基础上更进一步的机会窗口。 我们要强调并支持能够根除疟疾的方案和研究。	Today, we have a window of opportunity to build on what has already been accomplished, by highlighting and supporting initiatives and research efforts that could eradicate malaria.
美国和伊朗从1979年开始就打起了代理战争，两国之间的现时冲突意味着代理战争将会在黎巴嫩、伊拉克、阿富汗和里海地区继续，就如同在贸易和投资方面的战争一样。	The US and Iran have been fighting proxy wars since 1979, and their ongoing conflict means that proxy wars will continue in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Caspian Sea region, as will trade and investment wars.
海牙 — — 阿富汗战争迄今为止已经打了十年，在很多人看来或许仍没有结束的迹象，但拉丁美洲却忍受了更为漫长的战争，而且近来血腥程度甚至愈演愈烈： 这就是打击贩毒的“战争 ” 。	THE HAGUE – The war in Afghanistan, now approaching its tenth year, may seem to many to have no end in sight, but Latin America has endured an even longer fight, one that has recently become much more bloody: the “war” against drug trafficking.
保持对亚美尼亚的冻结冲突（frozen conflict）状态不利于土耳其或任何该地区国家的长期利益。	Maintaining the frozen conflict with Armenia is not in the long-term interests of Turkey or any other state in the region.
德国还带头着手建立一个欧洲“银行业联盟 ” ， 设立一个单一监管框架以及对陷入困境的金融机构具有约束力的解决方案机制。	Germany also led the move to establish a European “banking union” with a single regulatory framework and a binding resolution mechanism for troubled financial institutions.
学生如果不能合理地理解社会文化环境，就可能把大学仅仅当作追求个人目标、打造有用人际关系网、享受学生生活和（也许）肤浅地体验多样性的场所。	Without a reasonable awareness of their socio-cultural environment, students may view universities merely as a place to pursue private goals, make useful connections, enjoy student life, and perhaps pick up a superficial sense of diversity.
即将到来的美国-东盟峰会的一些出席领导人 — — 如统治柬埔寨25年之久的洪森 — — 此前被奥巴马认为过于残酷和专制，不容踏上美国领土。	The upcoming US-ASEAN summit will include leaders – like Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for 25 years – who were previously considered too ruthless and repressive to be received by the US president on American soil.
在富有魅力的翁贝尔多·波西的领导下，北方联盟在议会中握有决定性的席位，以此保证贝卢斯科尼政府的稳固。	The Lega Nord, led by the charismatic Umberto Bossi, holds the decisive votes in Parliament to keep the Berlusconi government afloat.
）美国的思维狭隘的方针 — — 它没有描述任何战后叙利亚愿景就是明证 — — 将外交主动权拱手让给了俄罗斯。	With that narrow-minded approach – reflected in the lack of any articulated vision for a post-war Syria – the US effectively handed the diplomatic reins over to Russia.
目前，美国政治中的一些最保守元素 — — 他们的后台是亿万富翁大卫和查尔斯·科奇（David and Charles Koch）兄弟，在气候变化问题上无动于衷对他们最有利 — — 正在试图抹黑方济各的观点。	Already, some of the most conservative elements in American politics – backed by those, like the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, who benefit from inaction on climate change – are attempting to denounce Francis’s views.
他们隔壁的邻居丧生，当第二天早晨发现尸体时，他们蜷缩在一起，他们年仅三岁的女儿令人心碎地被拥抱在当中。	Their next-door neighbors perished; when their corpses were discovered the next morning, they were crouched together, their three-year-old girl in the middle of a heartbreaking huddle.
法国总统弗朗索瓦·密特朗的统治加剧了之后的经济困难，密特朗的总理皮埃尔·戈瓦奉行强势法郎政策 — — 这一政策最终导致西非法郎于1994年贬值100 % 。	The ensuing economic difficulties were exacerbated under President François Mitterrand, whose prime minister, Pierre Bérégovoy, pursued a strong French franc – a policy that ultimately led to a massive 100% devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994.
一个单一、同质的人民，他们不会犯错，只需要一个真正的代表来合适地实施他们的意愿，这是一个幻想 — — 但这个幻想可以应对实际问题。	A single, homogeneous people who can do no wrong and need only a genuine representative to implement their will properly is a fantasy – but it is a fantasy that can respond to real problems.
上个月科学家、作家和反审查活动家的胜利表明由米尔顿发起的这场运动仍然在他自己的祖国有着顽强的生命力。	Last month’s victory by scientists, writers, and anti-censorship campaigners suggests that the movement launched by Milton still has life in his own country.
本周，全球领导人将齐聚奥斯陆发展教育峰会（Oslo Summit on Education for Development ） ， 美国的经验教训无比重要。	As world leaders gather this week for the Oslo Summit on Education for Development, the lessons from this experience could not be more relevant.
大部分评论家都例行公事地以为，若5月29日法国公民投票结果赞成正在审议中的欧盟宪法，这将对欧洲和欧盟都有好处。	Most commentators routinely assume that a Yes vote in the May 29 French referendum on the proposed European Union Constitution would be good for Europe and the EU.
因为核聚变反应产生α粒子，后者会污染等离子体。 因此必须在1亿度的火焰中塞入一个“偏滤器”来清洁它。	Since the fusion reactions produce alpha particles, which pollute the plasma, one has to insert a “divertor” inside the flame at 100 million degrees in order to clean it.
目前，课程改革可以做的最佳事情是提醒学生，经济学不是像物理学那样的科学，它的历史远远比标准教科书上的说法悠久。	For now, the best that curriculum reform can do is to remind students that economics is not a science like physics, and that it has a much richer history than is to be found in the standard textbooks.
在生物医学中，一系列案例已经产生了强大的将身体及其组成部分的权利从个人“所有者”转移到公司或研究机构的动力。	In biomedicine, a series of legal cases have generated powerful momentum toward the transfer of rights over the body and its component parts from the individual “owner” to corporations and research institutions.
结果，希腊从超GDP的10%的初级预算赤字（不含债务利息支付）变为去年超GDP的10%的初级预算盈余 — — 到目前为止，这是危机后时期欧洲最大幅度的改善。	As a result, Greece moved from a primary budget deficit (which excludes interest payments on debt) of more than 10% of GDP to a primary balance last year – by far the largest such reversal in post-crisis Europe.
它在俄罗斯的问题上只有粗略的经济政策；有在中东问题扮演重要角色的雄心，但是却缺乏周密计划的行动方案；还有，尽管在《东京议定书》占据原始的领导地位，但是在气候变化上却没有进一步的计划。	It has only sketchy economic policies toward Russia; ambitions, but no game plan, to become a player in the Middle East; and, despite its original leadership on the Kyoto Protocol, no successor program on climate change.
根据最新民调，伦齐可能会被迫履行他的承诺，进而宣告意大利 — — 以及其他国家 — — 改革派社会民主告一段落。	According to the latest polls, Renzi could be forced to make good on his pledge, which might spell the end of reformist social democracy in Italy – and beyond.
如果少数派执政联盟要将绿党也包括在内，将迫使CSU在移民问题和气候政策上作出妥协，但这不是必须的，因为SPD、左翼党（Die Linke） 和绿党都没有阻止立法的实力。	A minority coalition that included the Greens would force the CSU to compromise on migration issues and climate policy, which would be unnecessary otherwise, given the inability of the SPD, Die Linke (The Left), and the Greens to block legislation.
尽管普京是苏联的产物 — — 在苏联 ， “ 沙皇”是一个真正的贬义词 — — 但他表现出对昔日独裁的浓厚兴趣。	Though Putin is a product of the Soviet Union, where “czar” really was a derogatory word, he shows considerable fondness for the autocrats of old.
布什坚持中东和平方案必须接受西岸已经变化了“领土情况 ” ， 彻底改变了已经奉行了几十年的美国政策。 布什政府似乎决意要把对手驱赶到一起¾这种做法把塞谬尔·亨廷顿（Samuel Huntington）所描绘的“文化激烈冲突”的反面乌托邦变成了现实。	The administration seems bent on herding adversaries together – transforming Samuel Huntington’s “clash-of-civilizations” dystopia into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
第五，失业率越高，则政府预算赤字越大，因为经济当中的一些自动稳定器会减少政府岁入而增加政府支出（例如失业者福利方面的支出 ） 。	Fifth, the higher the unemployment rate goes, the wider budget deficits will become, as automatic stabilizers reduce revenue and increase spending (for example, on unemployment benefits).
要计算中国在经历了35年前所未有的经济增长之后还剩下多少后发优势，我们需要考察期技术和产业发展水平与高收入国家的差距。	To calculate how much of a latecomer advantage China has after 35 years of unprecedented growth, one needs to look at the gap between its levels of technological and industrial development and those of high-income countries.
如果上述势力破坏了占世界石油储量三分之二的波斯湾的石油输出，像20世纪30年代那样的全球经济衰退可以更进一步增强保护主义的力量。	And if such actors disrupt the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, home to two-thirds of the world’s reserves, a global depression like that of the 1930’s could strengthen protectionism further.
但是一个被人忽略、但却是可能的渴求者一直潜伏在世界经济当中，那就是不断增长的限制人口自由流通的 、 “ 隔离”富国的趋势。	But one little noticed, yet likely, aspirant has been sneaking up on the world economy: the growing tendency to limit the free circulation of people, to “fence in” the rich world.
现代经济体系使用货币，因为它作为价值的载体可以起到缓冲作用，使得供需之间无需实现完美平衡，并使所有行为者都能从贸易中得到自己想要的东西。	Modern systems use money, because, as a store of value, it serves as a kind of buffer, removing the need for a perfect balance between supply and demand, and enabling all actors to get what they need from trade.
但逊尼派极端分子仅上个月就实施了约50起自杀式袭击，多达500名平民（其中多数为什叶派）因此而丧生。	But Sunni extremists have launched some 50 suicide attacks in the last month, killing 500 mostly Shia civilians.
由于女性往往倾向于与具有较高社会经济地位的伴侣结婚或者形成固定关系，因此受教育程度较低且较贫穷的男性的求偶前景受到男性寻求庇护者涌入的影响最大。	Since women tend to “marry up,” or find partners with higher socioeconomic status, it is less educated and poorer men whose romantic prospects are most affected by an influx of male asylum-seekers.
从此以后飘扬在格鲁吉亚公共建筑上的欧盟旗帜表明一种天然的、和这个国家的历史一样久远的情感。 在古希腊人的眼中，格鲁吉亚在当时是世界固有的一部分。	The European Union flags that have flown on all Georgian public buildings since then signal a natural attachment, as old as the history of a country that, for the ancient Greeks, was an integral part of the world as it was then known.
纽约—大约25年前，哈佛教授、当时担任美国住联合国大使和纽约州参议员的丹尼尔·帕德里克·莫伊尼汉（Daniel Patrick Moynihan）创造了“正常行为的堕落 ” （ Defining Deviancy Down）一词。	NEW YORK – Some 25 years ago, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Harvard professor who in the course of his career served as United States ambassador to the United Nations and a US senator from New York, coined the phrase “Defining Deviancy Down.”
在经济表现发面存在如此巨大而持久的差距，仅仅是运气造成的可能性极低 — — 不需要深奥的计量经济学就可以说明这一点。	The likelihood that luck alone could have produced such large and consistent differences in economic performance is extremely low – a point that can be illustrated even without fancy econometrics.
因此，中国及其亚投行伙伴国可以办成大事 — — 公路、桥梁、大坝、铁路和港口都不在话下 — — 毫无疑问，这些项目能够增加经济实力、吸引公民注意，而美国 — — 世界银行也是如此 — — 不再提供资金。	China and its partners in the AIIB can thus build the big things – roads, bridges, dams, railroads and ports – that unquestionably power an economy and that citizens notice, but that the US, and for that matter the World Bank, no longer funds.
但是，自2008年底以来，每年发行的信用量相当于GDP的35 % ， 导致信用-GDP之比从危机前的150%飙升到现在的250 % 。	Since the end of 2008, however, credit amounting to 35% of GDP has been issued annually, causing the credit-to-GDP ratio to soar from less than 150% before the crisis to 250% today.
尽管使用衍生品的公司减少了它在欧元贬值上的风险暴露，但衍生品实际上带来了新的风险 — — 对手方风险。	Although the company using the derivative reduces its exposure to the risk of a failing euro, the derivative comes packaged with a new risk – counterparty risk.
拜页岩能源革命所赐，美国石油产量从2008年的每日五百万桶上升到2015年的930万桶，尽管价格暴跌，但这一产量增长仍得到了保持。	Thanks to the shale-energy revolution, American oil production has risen from five million barrels per day in 2008 to 9.3 million barrels in 2015, a supply boom that has so far persisted, despite the price collapse.
2002年来，全球抗击艾滋、结核和疟疾基金已经解放了前所未有的金融资源和人类财富，用于主要影响贫困人口的传染病防治工作。	Since 2002, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has unlocked an unprecedented wealth of human and financial resources to combat infectious diseases that disproportionately affect the poorest.
政府显然应该在支持新技术的开发中扮演角色，液压致裂法就是一例；但是，当技术已经成熟时，就没有理由要求某种天然气的生产方式应该通过税收减免的形式予以补贴。	Governments certainly have a role to play in supporting the development of new technologies, such as fracking; but, once the technology has been developed, there is no reason why one form of gas production should be subsidized via tax breaks.
对许多儿童来说，就算是他们有机会上学，基础设施的崩溃、缺水少电和夏季的高温也令他们很难有成效地学习。	For many children, even when they do attend school, the collapse of infrastructure, the unavailability of electricity and water, and high temperatures in the summer are hardly conducive to successful study.
在2003年到2004年年间，可能是国际货币基金组织不得不为其成员国提供有价值的帮助的最后阶段，提供的金融援助数额的约80%建立在“例外”基础上，超过配额的300 % 。	In 2003-2004, arguably the last period in which the Fund had to provide meaningful assistance to members, approximately 80% of the volume of financial support was provided on an “exceptional” basis, defined as more than 300% of quotas.
具有讽刺意味的是，诺贝尔奖是针对就某些认知特征所作的研究而颁发的。 而在行为科学最广为人知的脑力评估 —智力测验里，这些认知特征却完全无影无踪。	Ironically, the Nobel Prize was awarded for studies of cognitive characteristics that are entirely missing from the most well-known mental assessment device in the behavioral sciences: intelligence tests.
但长期的军政府统治下，缅甸向世界关上了大门，使其问题内部化，并在亚洲其他地区蓬勃兴起之时陷入了停滞。	Under its long-serving military junta, Burma shut itself off from the world, internalized its problems, and stagnated as the rest of Asia boomed.
货币政策 — — 特别是最近几年被央行采用的开足马力印钞的“量化宽松”计划 — — 也已经没有了空间，物价通胀正在抬头，央行资产负债表规模也达到了创纪录的水平。	Monetary policy – in particular, the vast money-printing “quantitative easing” programs pursued by central banks in recent years – has run out of space, too, with price inflation ticking up and central-bank balance sheets a record size.
新抗生素被发现后，公共卫生当局理所当然地想用它来补充储备，坚持认为只有当其他备选药品都不起作用的情况下才能启用新抗生素。	When a new antibiotic is discovered, public health authorities rightly want to keep it in reserve, insisting that it be used only when all other options have failed.
在认为能够利用强大的常规军事力量在去年夏天的黎巴嫩战争中摧毁真主党的问题上，以色列也犯下了类似的错误。	Israel made a similar mistake in thinking that it could use its enormous margin of conventional military power to destroy Hezbollah in last summer’s Lebanon War.
一些内部电子邮件显示，一位泛美开发银行内的美国律师向美国财政部提出如下建议：虽然这些贷款不存在合法性技术障碍，但是美国可以通过“延缓”贷款进程来有效地阻止贷款的发放。	Internal emails reveal that a US legal counselor inside the IDB proposed to the US Treasury Department that, though the loans faced no legitimate technical obstacles, the US could effectively block them by “slowing” the process.
在几乎每个转折点上，而且几乎涉及所有重大问题，国家政府都未能拿出有效决策，而城市领袖却继续鼓舞着公众的信心。	At nearly every turn, on just about every major issue, national governments are failing to deliver solutions, while city leaders continue to inspire public confidence.
发自伦敦 — — 最近在越南，柬埔寨和老挝三国度假期间，我总会忍不住去思考这些国家的经济潜力以及当下面临的各类政策挑战。	LONDON – On a recent holiday in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, I couldn’t resist thinking about these countries’ economic potential and ongoing policy challenges.
例如，由英国发起的国际可再生能源和能源效率合作组织，已经发展成为众多国家在可再生能源和节能能源上的多功能性组织。	For example, the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership, founded in the United Kingdom, has grown into a multi-stakeholder body supporting renewables and efficiency in numerous countries.
因此，正如在文化领域的其它方面实行的策略那样，中国政府在很大程度上放弃了对电视内容在道德方面的控制。	Thus, in a strategy mirrored elsewhere in the cultural sphere, the government simply relinquished much control over the moral component of TV content.
自2016年政变失败以来，土耳其法庭已经审理了约4，6000起涉及起诉民众侮辱总统、民族或国家机构的案子。	Since a failed coup attempt in 2016, Turkey’s courts have processed some 46,000 cases involving people accused of insulting the president, the nation, or its institutions.
这一点从911以来并没有改变，尽管本土出生的美国人对美国穆斯林越发怀有敌意。 他们这样做就是假定穆斯林无法同化(过去在不同的国家人们也这样攻击犹太人 ) 。	That has not changed since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, despite rising hostility toward US Muslims among native-born Americans, based the assumption that they could not assimilate (a charge often directed in the past at Jews in various countries).
与此同时，这场战争反而刺激了人们对于汽车、洗衣机、冰箱、割草机、电视机等批量化生产的产品的大量需求，这种需求在战时已经被压抑过久。	At the same time, the war left enormous pent-up demand for the products of mass production: cars, washing machines, refrigerators, lawn mowers, television sets, and more.
任何对糖尿病的诊断或是随后的病情发展监测都需要回顾患者医疗记录并调阅病历 — — 因此进入诊所的患者管理信息系统。	Any diagnosis of diabetes, or subsequent monitoring of disease progression, requires a medical consultation and hence an entry into the patient record – and so into the practice’s patient-management information system.
穆罕默德·萨德尔，一位以前曾率领民众对美国军队发动致命袭击的狂热什叶派教士，现在正逐渐成为美国遏制伊朗势力在该地区扩张的最大希望。	Muqtada al-Sadr, the fiery Shia cleric who previously led deadly attacks against US troops, is now emerging as America’s best hope of containing Iran’s expanding influence in Iraq.
此外还有间叫HealthRally的公司，该公司利用行为经济学的理念来激励人们实现自身的健康和保健目标。	Then there’s HealthRally, which uses insights from behavioral economics to motivate people to achieve their own health and wellness goals.
事实上，在欧洲央行宣布其购买计划一天后 — — 实际购买操作要在几周后才开始 — — 整个欧元区的利率应声下跌了不到一个百分点。	Indeed, just one day after the ECB made its announcement – and weeks before the purchases began – interest rates fell by a fraction of a percentage point throughout the eurozone.
就法国而言，奥巴马政府将目标对准通过向利比亚和叙利亚输送急需的军事和政治资源大力建设与美国的信任的盟友，这如何说得过去？	In the case of France, how could the Obama administration justify targeting an ally that has tried hard to build trust with the US by providing much-needed military and political cover in Libya and Syria?
如果新出现的冲突和竞争压力导致经济制裁或重要贸易途径的阻塞，由此产生的全球贸易分裂将极大地抵消全球化所带来的利益。	If emerging conflicts and competitive pressures lead to, say, economic sanctions or the obstruction of key trade routes, the resulting balkanization of global trade would diminish globalization’s benefits substantially.
事实上，在2003年热浪期间，拥有58座核反应堆 — — 其中大部分位于卢瓦尔河这样的生态敏感流域 — — 的法国电力集团只能被迫通过欧洲现货市场从邻国购买电力。	Indeed, during the 2003 heat wave, Électricité de France, which operates 58 reactors – the majority on ecologically sensitive rivers like the Loire – was compelled to buy power from neighboring countries on the European spot market.
卢的自杀对其家庭是个灾难，对其国家是个耻辱，而朝鲜核爆炸则是领导人金正日火爆脾气的某种体现，以上事件是对于两个朝鲜族国家，乃至整个世界来说都有很严重的后果。	Roh’s suicide is a disaster for his family and a national shame, while North Korean leader Kim Jong-il’s nuclear blast is something of a temper tantrum, but one which may have dire consequences for the two Koreas and the world.
当然，很多怀疑论者提出只要采取低成本的合理预防措施，大规模网络崩溃的可能性非常之低，末日论者夸大了可能出现最坏情况。	True, many skeptics argue that with reasonable low-cost prophylactic measures, large scale cyber-meltdowns are highly implausible, and that doom-mongers overstate the worst-case scenarios.
公司应该与地方和全球层面的LGBT群体和其他组织会晤，实施来自它们有业务的更进步的地区(如欧洲和美国)所采取的政策。	Companies should meet with LGBT groups at other organizations, both locally and globally, and implement policies from the more progressive regions in which they do business (say, Europe and the US).
因此，欧元区面临三大选择：重债国进行更多的紧缩、将全欧洲债务社会化，以及创造性的债务重组（这意味着投资者迟早会被迫接受损失 ） 。	Thus, the eurozone faces three choices: even more austerity for the heavily-indebted countries, socialization of the debt across Europe, or a creative re-profiling of debt, with investors forced to accept losses sooner or later.
但欧盟出人意料的账单不仅仅是金融上的，因为它的到来正逢反欧盟的英国独立党（United Kingdom Independence Party）在民调中狂飙突进之时。	But the impact of the EU’s unexpected budget invoice is not just financial, for it has arrived at a time when the anti-EU, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) is riding high in opinion polls.
实际上她遭到了她自己以前的盟友，费尔多克以及荷兰各种对外国人持憎恨态度的人的背叛，他们对一个来自索马里的敢于直言不讳的黑人女移民的讨厌并不亚于他们对穆斯林的讨厌。	She was betrayed by her own former ally, Rita Verdonk, and a variety of Dutch xenophobes, who don’t like an outspoken black female immigrant from Somalia any more than they like Muslims.
政府的“创业投资引导基金”为风险投资和私募股权投资者提供了总额达274亿美元的资金 — — 这是一项拥有特殊赎回奖励措施的被动性投资。	The government’s Guiding Fund program has provided a total of $27.4 billion to venture capital and private equity investors – a passive investment, but with special redemption incentives.
但要战胜疫情，接种不但要在罗安达继续进行（该省还有150万人暴露在传染风险下 ） ， 还必须扩展到其他受影响省份。	But to end the outbreak, vaccination has to continue not only in Luanda, where an additional 1.5 million are at risk of infection, but also encompass other affected provinces.
例如在2016年，仅9%的美国消费者付费购买在线新闻服务；而上述份额在2017年上升到16 % ， 并在今年保持稳定。	In 2016, for example, only 9% of American consumers paid for news online; that share rose to 16% in 2017 and has held steady this year.
据2018年9月进行的一次爱可信调查显示，占总数80%的共和党人 — — 共和党长期以来一直是自由贸易的最大支持者 — — 认为提高关税将会对美国有益。	According to a September 2018 Axios survey, fully 80% of Republicans – long the party most supportive of free trade – believed that increased tariffs would be good for the US.
但国际外交的历史对于国际金融来说同样是正确的 — — 一系列看似合理的决策可能产生灾难性后果，如果没人愿意挑明结局的话。	But what is true of international diplomacy – that a series of seemingly reasonable decisions can have cataclysmic consequences if no one bothers to figure out the endgame – is equally true of international finance.
他们享有“完全封闭”的雇佣和解雇特权、毫无争议的领导人选举、缺乏透明度的强制性会费，以及十分强大的政治权力。	They enjoy “closed shop” hiring and firing prerogatives, leadership elections by acclamation, mandatory dues without transparency, and immense political power.
中国的许多公用事业机构 — — 如航空、铁路、港口和通讯等 — — 都是单一产品实体，由国有企业负责经营管理。	Many public utilities in China – such as airlines, railways, ports, and telecommunications – are single-product entities administered by state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
没有合法性，任何一种政治体系都谈不上稳定；没有选举 ― ― 这个明确接受执政者的多数人的意愿表示，也不可能有合法性这一说法。	Without legitimacy, there can be no stability in any political system, and without elections – that is, an explicit expression of popular consent to the holders of power – there can be no legitimacy.
对联盟意图的一个包容性解释是它正在寻求一个以丹麦开创的成功“灵活安全（flexicurity ） ” 措施为蓝本的系统。	A charitable interpretation of the coalition’s intent is that it is pursuing a system modeled on the successful “flexicurity” measures pioneered by Denmark.
可以肯定的是，我会公开揭穿那些不可信的新闻来源，而未来的新闻业应当帮助读者学习认识什么才是好的新闻资源，以及作为一个优秀的公民记者需要一些什么样的品质。	To be sure, I have been exposed to flimsy sources, and newspapers of the future should help readers learn what a good source is, and what good citizen journalism requires.
而实际上这个怪圈当中最为自相矛盾的一点，则是在谈判期间所建立起的犹太人定居点可比冲突时建造的要多得多。	Indeed, the great paradox of this cycle is that more settlements are built during times of negotiations than during times of conflict.
许多在我的 Facebook 社区上留言的人都认为国会已经彻底崩溃了，而对美国两大党的信仰的都是很傻很天真。	Many who spoke to me directly in my Facebook community believe that Congress is utterly broken and regard faith in either of America’s major parties as naïve.
你也许会认为，当有证据表明债券存续期内通胀会变高时，长期利率会趋于高企，从而补偿投资者预期的美元购买力下降。	One might think that long-term interest rates tend to be high when there is evidence that there will be higher inflation over the life of the bond, to compensate investors for the expected decline in the dollar’s purchasing power.
公共科学图书馆医学杂志最近一项研究预测，2080年美国与炎热相关的死亡将增长五倍多；贫困国家所面临的前景将更加糟糕。	A recent study in the journal PLOS Medicine projects a fivefold increase in heat-related deaths in the US by 2080; the outlook for poorer countries is even worse.
然而，即使在本世纪《京都议定书》被完全加以执行，它也只能以每年1800亿美元的代价，给气温降低无足轻重的华氏0.3度（摄氏0.2度 ） 。	Yet, even if Kyoto were fully implemented throughout this century, it would reduce temperatures by an insignificant 0.3°F (0.2oC), at an annual cost of $180 billion.
这些所谓的“倒置 ” （ inversion）可以让它们摆脱美国独有的不利的公司税规则，降低总税负。	These so-called “inversions” would reduce these companies’ total tax bill by allowing them to escape from the United States’ uniquely unfavorable corporate tax rules.
阿根廷经济学家、布宜诺斯艾利斯省银行（Banco de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires）行长斯特尔泽尼格（Federico Sturzenegger）估算，死牛气田天然气价值（以阿根廷现行天然气进口价格衡量）是阿根廷GDP的九倍。	Federico Sturzenegger, an Argentine economist and President of Banco de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, has estimated the value of Vaca Muerta gas (at the prices Argentina currently pays for gas imports) to be equal to nine times the country’s GDP.
对于那些渴望稳定和民主的伊拉克人而言，好消息是一种涣散的、无组织和无政府状态的叛乱不可能取得传统意义上取代现政府并建立新政权的“胜利 ” 。	The good news for those who desire stability and democracy in Iraq is that an amorphous, disorganized, and nihilistic insurgency cannot “win” in the traditional sense of replacing the government and forming a new regime.
在今后不到两年的时间内，保加利亚和罗马尼亚将使之变为现实，同时克罗地亚和土耳其的入盟谈判，以及塞尔维亚和乌克兰的入盟资格讨论也将开始。	In less than two years, this will become a reality for Bulgaria and Romania, while negotiations are beginning with Croatia and Turkey. There is also talk about membership for Serbia and Ukraine.
我返回俄国的日子白天参加官方会议，在交通拥堵中浪费几个钟头，晚上则跟着老友领略莫斯科最繁华的夜生活。	My days back in Russia were divided between official meetings, hours wasted in traffic jams, and nights spent with old friends who tried to show me the best of Moscow nightlife.
必须承认，一个领导人的品质和能力要比其成果（诸如人均收入、预期寿命、新生儿死亡率，识字率和犯罪率）更加难以测量。	Admittedly, a leader’s integrity and competence are more difficult to measure than outcomes (such as per capita income, life expectancy, infant mortality, literacy, and crime).
与此同时，马克龙呼吁建立一个有共同预算的更加深入一体化的欧元区，共同预算部分可以用泛欧盟金融交易税筹集（目前只有法国和英国征收金融交易税 ） 。	Macron, meanwhile, has called for a more deeply integrated eurozone with a common budget, which would be funded, in part, by an EU-wide financial transactions tax (currently only France and the United Kingdom levy an FTT).
GiveWell.net，评估了一些拯救贫穷国家生命的组织后，已经确认， 救活一个生命不到1000美元。	Similarly, the World Bank’s Disease Control Priorities Report tells us that a program to treat tuberculosis in the developing world, promoted by the Stop TB Partnership, gives people an extra year of life at a cost ranging from $5 to $50.
它们的失职 — — 具体体现在臃肿的治理系统和迟迟拿不出结果的没完没了的峰会中 — — 以及缺乏民主合法性正在受到欧洲大陆千百万选民的唾弃。	Their inadequacies – embodied in a cumbersome system of governance, and in endless, inconclusive summitry – and their lack of democratic legitimacy are being repudiated by millions of voters throughout the continent.
无论让犯罪分子“无处藏身，不管引发什么后果”听起来如何诱人，当犯罪分子是国家领导人的时候，我们不能忽略后果。	Whatever the attractions of giving criminals “nowhere to hide, whatever the consequences,” the consequences cannot be ignored when the criminals are heads of state.
但是，由于欧洲对东亚的经济依赖意见严重，其在东亚的利益也极其巨大，从中期看，这一不匹配状况可能引起欧盟严重的不安。	Yet, given Europe’s growing economic dependence on East Asia, its interests are massively engaged – a mismatch that could cause the EU considerable discomfort in the medium term.
从这个角度，美���延长专利和版权保护期的要求可谓“任性 ” ， 因为这绝非明显有利于经济效率的做法。	In this sense, the US demand for longer terms of patent and copyright protection is arbitrary, because they are not founded on a clear-cut case for enhanced economic efficiency.
自2004年以来该国年均经济增长率超过了10 ％ ， 并因此实现了贫困状况和医疗卫生条件的显著改善。	Its economy has grown at an average annual rate exceeding 10% since 2004, which has translated into significant poverty reduction and improved health outcomes.
而短短几个月后，英国脱欧和特朗普当选总统就被人们普遍视为早在数十年前就已经有人预测到的反精英反全球化浪潮不可避免的产物。	A few months later, Brexit and the Trump presidency were universally acknowledged as the inevitable consequence of an anti-elitist, anti-globalization backlash that was predictable decades ago.
据美国官方数据，1891—1972年每工人真实GDP平均每年增长2.3 % ， 而此后的平均增长率只有1.5 % 。	According to official US statistics, real GDP per worker grew at an average annual rate of 2.3% from 1891 to 1972, but by only 1.5% since then.
具有说明力的是，联合国发展计划署 — — 负责报告MDG进展情况的机构 — — 所准备的“进展图”所追踪的唯一一个该大目标相关数字是互联网的使用情况。	It is perhaps telling that the “progress charts” prepared by the United Nations Development Program, the agency charged with reporting on progress toward achieving the MDGs, track only Internet usage under that goal.
如果这是因为拥有每年产生4%的收益率的资产而产生的结果，那么这意味着美国非但没有欠人9.1万亿美元，而是积累了价值5.2万亿美元的资产。	If that were the consequence of owning some kind of asset that yields 4% a year, it means that instead of owing $9.1 trillion, the US accumulated an asset worth $5.2 trillion.
PISA出现前，许多政府都宣称它们管理者世界上最成功的教育体系，并认为它们i经采取了必要措施纠正一切缺陷。	Before PISA, many governments claimed that they oversaw the world’s most successful education systems, and insisted that they had already taken the steps needed to address any shortcomings.
然而，虽然尚未就GDP替代指标的问题达成国际共识，但在对经济活动进行更周全的思考方面已经取得了可喜的进展。	Still, while no international consensus on an alternative to GDP has emerged, there has been encouraging progress toward a more considered way of thinking about economic activity.
同时由于大多数风险都由银行（而非对冲基金）这种对金融支付系统起核心润滑作用的机构来承担，所以一个主权债务危机往往会造成大范围冲击。	And, because much of the risk is borne by banks (rather than by, say, hedge funds), which play a central role in lubricating the payments system, a sovereign-debt crisis can cause widespread harm.
类似地，意大利和法国的私人财富/GDP比率大约为五比一，而西班牙 — — 至少在危机全面爆发之前 — — 高达六比一。	Likewise, Italy and France share a private wealth/GDP ratio of five to one, while Spain’s – at least before the crisis hit the country in full – was six to one.
恐怖和战争的景象不断烦扰着人们，然而全球各个地区都不同程度地经历了多年来最强劲的经济增长。 尽管油价飙升，通货膨胀却保持在低水平，金融市场也势态良好。	Yet every region of the globe has experienced some of the strongest economic growth seen in years, inflation remains subdued despite surging oil prices, and financial markets are doing well.
实际上，诺贝尔经济学奖得主Amartya Sen表明，由于揭示少数权贵对贫穷大众的巧取豪夺，言论自由甚至可以减轻类似饥荒那样的自然灾害。	Indeed, the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen has demonstrated that free speech even helps mitigate seemingly natural catastrophes like famines, because it reveals the ways in which a few haves exploit the many have-nots.
Si bien el Pacto Nazi-Soviético no duró mucho (Alemania invadió Rusia en 1941) no había salida para Polonia.	Although the Nazi-Soviet Pact did not last long – Germany invaded Russia in 1941 – for Poland there was no way out.
波兰人认识到相对于呼吁变革和反抗压迫的苦难历程，推动一个旨在实现一个更美好未来的清晰合理进程才更加艰难。	Poland learned the hard way that demanding change and defying oppression are much less difficult than formulating and delivering a clear, reasonable program for a better future.
因此，早美国军队可能离开阿富汗的同时，而由这场美国战争而形成的暴力平息局面也将化为一场泡影 — — 特别是对阿富汗的南亚邻国来说。	So, while US troops may be leaving Afghanistan, an end to the violence spawned by America’s war remains nothing more than a distant dream – especially for Afghanistan’s South Asian neighbors.
由此带来的脆弱性集中体现在今年一月俄罗斯削减对乌克兰的天然气供应事件上。 它使得输往中欧和西欧的天然气也有所减少。	The resulting vulnerability was highlighted by the Russian reduction of gas supplies to Ukraine in January, which resulted in reduced flows to central and western Europe.
德国劳动力市场制度让许多服务业工人无法获得很强的讨价还价力和保护，这产生了欧洲规模最庞大的低薪部门之一。	Germany’s labor-market institutions leave many service workers without much bargaining power or protection, thereby creating one of the largest low-wage sectors in Europe.
今年年初，新报已经有了的第一份草稿，有为的专家团德国主席认为专家团不应该重写2015年报告，而是要试图阐述更多关于各国在和平年代应该采取哪些措施的内容。	A first draft of a new report existed at the beginning of this year, and the able German chairman argued that the group should not rewrite the 2015 report, but try to say more about the steps that states should take in peacetime.
此外，在1877年政令中，太政官（1868—1885年间日本最高决策机构）否认任何关于独岛的主权主张。	Moreover, the Dajokan, Japan’s highest decision-making body in 1868-1885, denied any claims of sovereignty over Dokdo through its Order of 1877.
相反，其中一个重要的驱动力是各主要国央行都采取实验性的措施来补偿其他方面的政策失当和政治系统运作失调。	Rather, an important driver is major central banks’ pursuit of experimental measures in order to compensate for policy inadequacies and political dysfunction elsewhere.
前农业部长沙拉得·帕瓦（Sharad Pawar）曾指出，价值83亿美元或相当于总年产量近40%的粮食是浪费掉的。	Sharad Pawar, a former agriculture minister, has noted that food worth $8.3 billion, or nearly 40% of the total value of annual production, is wasted.
朱塞佩·托马西·兰佩杜萨（Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa）的名著《豹 》 （ Il Gattopardo）中写道，改变一切最后只能让一切不变。	As in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s great novel Il Gattopardo (The Leopard), changing everything could be just the way to keep it all the same.
但是，过去两年中改变突尼斯、埃及和利比亚的并不是外界为改善这些社团或经济状况而进行的努力，而是旨在改变各自国家的政治制度的基层社会运动。	But what has transformed Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya over the last two years has not been efforts by the outside world to improve these societies or their economies, but grassroots social movements intent on changing their countries’ political systems.
说真的，英国财政大臣欧思邦（George Osborne）甚至说 ： “ 在一般商业里，欺骗是一宗罪，为什么在银行业就不该是呢 ？ ”	Indeed, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne went so far as to say, “Fraud is a crime in ordinary business; why shouldn’t it be so in banking?”
国际货币基金组织在2006年启动的对全球失衡的多边监管，是朝向这个方向发展的一个引人兴味的措施，但是，这一措施缺乏成员国的承诺，也没有执行机构。	The multilateral surveillance on global imbalances that the Fund launched in 2006 was an interesting step in this direction, but it has lacked commitment by the parties, as well as teeth.
解放这一信息宝藏能扩大统计样本，达到接近普查的规模；提高它们的及时性和准确性；并降低企业和家庭的回应成本。	Unlocking this trove of information would extend statistical samples to near-census size, increase their timeliness and accuracy, and reduce the respondent costs to businesses and households.
同时，如果给欧洲议会，而不是委员会，过多欠考虑的自由决定权，那么恢复预算平衡的'同辈压力'也许会很容易变为'同辈保护 ' 。	"At the same time, if so much unchecked discretion was left to the Council, rather than to the Commission, ""peer pressure"" to restore budget balance might easily turn into ""peer protection."""
现在是扩大全球金融改革议程范围的时候了。 全球金融改革到目前为止，仍然只关注着一些关键但是有限的问题 — — 尤其是金融监管问题。	It is time to broaden the agenda of global financial reform, which so far has focused on an essential but still limited set of issues, particularly financial regulation.
OMT计划允许欧洲央行购买同意实施经济改革的国家的主权债券，从而让欧洲央行与其发达国家同侪站在了同一水平线上。	The OMT program, which allows the ECB to buy sovereign bonds of countries that have agreed to reform their economies, significantly levels the playing field between the Bank and its advanced-economy peers.
你必须拥有同样的血才能属于英雄的日耳曼民族，而盎格鲁-萨克斯世界的公民权向所有愿意遵守法律的移民开放。	You had to share the same blood to belong to the heroic German Volk, whereas citizenship in the Anglo-Saxon world was open to immigrants who agreed to abide by the law.
塞内加尔希望能在2020年实现基本消灭疟疾（NMCP的定义是每年每千人患病不到五例 ） ， 世卫组织认为塞内加尔可以在2030年彻底消灭疟疾。	Senegal is hoping to achieve pre-elimination (defined by the NMCP as fewer than five cases per 1,000 people annually) by 2020, with the WHO certifying malaria as fully eliminated from the country by 2030.
即使是带有明确目的的计划也有可能适得其反：几年前，欧洲带着良好的意愿尝试刺激可再生能源投资，结果导致了宏观经济出现太阳能泡沫。	Even seemingly purposeful projects can seriously backfire: only a few years ago, Europe’s well-intentioned efforts to stimulate renewables resulted in a solar energy bubble of macroeconomic proportions.
而更重要的是，他在2010年所取得的成绩，将在很大程度上决定世界将如何把这些业已存在了60年的反核武器禁令，继续维护下去。	Even more important, his progress in 2010 will say a lot about the world’s ability to maintain the existing 60-year taboo against the use of nuclear weapons.
牛津大学卡尔·弗雷和迈克尔·奥斯伯恩在2013年所进行的一项标志性研究表明在今后几十年，自动化将威胁美国47%的就业总人数。	A landmark 2013 study by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University suggests that, in the coming decades, 47% of total US employment will be at risk of automation.
简而言之，欧元区内部调整是可以在南欧不出现严重通缩的情况下实现的，只要那里的生产率增长能够加速，同时北欧能够适当加快工资增长助其一臂之力。	In short, internal adjustment in the eurozone is achievable without serious deflation in the south, provided that productivity growth there accelerates, and that the north does its part by encouraging modestly faster wage gains.
欧洲应该与伊朗市民社会站在一起，欧洲议会已经高度赞扬了伊朗人民为捍卫基本自由和民主原则而奋斗的勇气。	Europe should stand with Iran's civil society, and the European Parliament has already paid tribute to the courage of all those Iranian men and women who are defending their basic freedoms and democratic principles.
首先，劳动力收入下降意味着，由于严重财富缩水（股票、房产贬值）和负债率急剧上升而遭受重创的居民消费还将继续下滑。	First, falling labor income implies falling consumption for households, which have already been hard hit by a massive loss of wealth (as the value of equities and homes has fallen) and a sharp rise in their debt ratios.
研发特别是基础研究的投资是重要的决定因素（尽管它长期滞后 ） ； 特朗普政府所提出的的削减拨款不会带来好结果。	Investments in research and development, especially in basic research, are an important determinant, though with long lags; cutbacks proposed by the Trump administration do not bode well.
他先将冲突升级到眼看就要造成真正的经济损失的程度，然后抛出他知道中国肯定会接受的和解条件，这样就能回到贸易战前的现状，还能让他看起来像是政治赢家。	By escalating confrontation to a level just short of real economic damage, and then offering peace terms that he knows China will accept, Trump can return to the pre-trade war status quo but emerge looking like a political winner.
如今，美国将转向外交政策现实主义，国务卿希拉里·克林顿最近与埃及伊斯兰主义者总统穆尔西的会面清楚地标明了美国的新方向。	A shift to foreign-policy realism is now expected, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent meeting with Egypt’s Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, is a clear indication of America’s new orientation.
鉴于世界经济预期将持续快速增长，我们将面临极佳的投资机遇，但是这只有在资本能够继续流入能够富有成效地使用它的国家的情况才能实现。	With the world expected to continue growing rapidly, there are excellent investment opportunities that will be funded only if capital continues to move into countries that can use it productively.
社会民主党(SPD)和基督教社会党(CDU)都坚定不移地坚持“社会市场经济 ” ， 坚持社团主义经济管理的原则，坚持维护福利国家的权利，也都坚持对欧盟和北约的承诺。	The Social Democrats (SPD) and the Christian Democrats (CDU) are both committed to the “social market economy,” to the essentials of corporatist economic management, to maintaining the entitlements of the welfare state, and to the EU and NATO.
法国军队一再干预乍得、加蓬、扎伊尔、中非共和国、多哥和科特迪瓦的内部事务，支持并保护自大、腐败、专制、无能的领导人，推翻不听指挥的领袖，或者平息内乱。	French troops have repeatedly intervened in Chad, Gabon, Zaire, Central Africa, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire to prop up and protect complacent, corrupt, undemocratic, and incompetent leaders, remove recalcitrant ones, or curb civil unrest.
莫内和其他欧洲技术官僚并不反对民主，但出于迫不及待地让欧洲多样化的民族国家统一起来的狂热，他们通常会表现出对民主的忽视。	Monnet and other European technocrats were not exactly opposed to democracy, but in their zeal to unify Europe’s diverse nation-states, they often appeared to ignore it.
由于除了我们自身之外，再无别的人种可以存活（弗洛里斯人大约在18 000年前灭绝 ） ， 未来人种间未必能够和谐共存。	Given that no human species other than our own survives (Homo floresiensis disappeared about 18,000 years ago), the prospects for harmonious coexistence among future human species are not reassuring.
伦敦—传统智慧对近期石油价格暴跌的解释是我们正在重复1985—1986年的崩盘，当时，沙特阿拉伯加大了产量，这是它与其他欧佩克成员国纠纷的一部分。	LONDON – The conventional wisdom regarding the recent plunge in the price of oil is that we are seeing a repeat of the 1985-1986 collapse, when Saudi Arabia ramped up production as part of a dispute with other members of the OPEC cartel.
在我担任首相之初，我发起了观察者称为“安倍经济学”的政策组合，因为长期以来，只有我的国家的名义工资水平处于负实际增长状态。	At the beginning of my premiership, I launched what observers have called “Abenomics,” because only in my country had the nominal wage level remained in negative territory for a staggering length of time.
此前，安理会批准了一项决议建立禁飞区并采取其他行动保护利比亚平民，而北约将这一决议作为用空中轰炸推翻卡扎菲政权的接口。	After the Security Council approved a resolution to institute a no-fly zone and take other actions ostensibly to protect Libyan civilians, NATO used the resolution as a pretext to overthrow Qaddafi’s regime through aerial bombardment.
普京可以在这些人的支持下稳坐江山，但却无法借这些人的力量继续前进，因为最优秀最聪明的俄罗斯人都不是这群人当中。	Putin can sit on their support, but cannot ride forward with it. The best and brightest are not there.
特朗普内阁还提出了《全面联合行动计划》某些条款的时效性问题 — — 比如实际在十年时间内严格限制伊朗对高级离心机的研发活动。	The Trump administration also takes issue with the time limits on the JCPOA, with some provisions – such as strict limits on research and development of advanced centrifuges – in effect for just ten years.
面对危机，不仅需要加强应变能力，而且还要让欧元区经济体做好应对全球化、人口老龄化、资源匮乏和气候变化的长期挑战。	This requires not just reinforcing resilience in the face of crisis, but also equipping euro-area economies for the longer-term challenges of globalization, aging, resource scarcity, and climate change.
这是一场事关社会责任的选举。 所谓社会责任，即社会支持因并非由其自身造成的错误而承受寻找工作、实现收支平衡压力的群体的义务。	This is an election about social responsibility – a society’s obligation to support those who are struggling, through no fault of their own, to find jobs and make ends meet.
政府缺少财政空间，希腊银行背上了沉重的不良贷款负担，因此，动员希腊剩余资产、打通银行信用流向私人部门的健康部分的渠道十分重要。	With the government lacking fiscal room, and Greek banks burdened by non-performing loans, it is important to mobilize the state’s remaining assets and unclog the flow of bank credit to healthy parts of the private sector.
在需求侧，市场评论家们终于猛然意识到某些在2017年大部分时间已经表现得极为明朗的形势：世界经济增长势头强劲，目前可能正在以4％或更高的速度增长。	On the demand side, market commentators are finally waking up to something that has been pretty clear for most of 2017: the world economy has gained momentum, and is now probably growing at a rate of 4% or higher.
我们可以把整合电网想象成一个巨大的环，从英国连接到挪威，然后穿越英吉利海峡与法国，比利时和荷兰对接，再接上德国并回到斯堪的纳维亚半岛。	The integrated grid can be imagined as a large ring, connecting Norway with the United Kingdom, and then linking across the channel to France, Belgium, and Holland, before moving on to Germany and returning to Scandinavia.
好像伊拉克国内的逊尼派-什叶派分裂问题还不够棘手似的，现在又出现了一个更深刻、甚至问题更大的裂痕 — — 土耳其与其自身身份和外部划定的边界的斗争。	As if the Sunni-Shia divide within Iraq were not difficult enough, a deeper and even more problematic fissure has now emerged – Turkey’s own struggles with its identity and its externally imposed borders.
在下一个十年结束时，英国人口预计将超七千万，即增加360万或5.5 % ， 原因就在于移民净流入并且新来者的出生人口比死亡人口更多。	The UK population is projected to surpass 70 million before the end of the next decade, an increase of 3.6 million, or 5.5%, owing to net immigration and a surplus of births over deaths among the newcomers.
正如记者卡约尔（Christian Caryl）所说 ： “ 说历史和经济条件让一国走上某条道路并不意味着该国政治家必须决定接受这一点 。 ”	As the journalist Christian Caryl put it, “to say that historical or economic conditions predispose a country to embark on a particular path does not mean that its politicians will necessarily decide to take it.”
它们惊恐地看到，正在成为世界第一大在线零售商的亚马逊将连锁书店Borders推向了破产，它们害怕自己会成为下一个。	They watched in horror as Amazon, en route to becoming the world’s largest online retailer, pushed the bookstore chain Borders into bankruptcy, and have wondered if they will be next.
但正如詹姆斯·夸克和我在合著的美国财政政策著作《燃烧的白宫》中所诠释的那样，共和党右翼青睐负责任预算和财务稳定的时代早已过去。	But, as James Kwak and I explained in our book on US fiscal policy, White House Burning, the time when the Republican right favored responsible budgets and financial stability has long since passed.
但即便中国想制定更加宏大的目标，目前在中国的目标产业的世界市场上份额远高于中国的美国，又有什么权利阻止中国参与争夺？	But even if China wanted to set more ambitious goals, by what right could the US – which now possesses much larger market shares in the targeted industries – block it from attempting to do so?
但即使美国与墨西哥的贸易赤字在名义上有所增长，其相对于美国贸易总额和GDP的比率（从1986年1.2％的最高点到2015年的不足0.2 ％ ） 都有所下降。	But, even as the US trade deficit with Mexico has grown in nominal terms, it has declined relative to total US trade and as a share of US GDP (from a peak of 1.2% in 1986 to less than 0.2% in 2015).
但是大多数美国人，尽管在布什第一任期内曾支持过减税（因为减税能让他们得到一点点额外的现金 ） ， 现在却不支持随后对基本政府服务的抨击。	But the majority of Americans, having supported the tax cuts in Bush’s first term because it gave them a little extra cash, do not support the attack on basic government services that has followed.
但协议不仅没有在这方面做出明确的表述，反而用扭曲的语言来避免发布这样的正式声明 — — 以及随之而来的必不可少的解释。	Yet, rather than providing such clarity, the pact uses contorted language to avoid such an official declaration – and the explanations that would have to come with it.
萨克指出 ， “ 这笔债务对国家不具有约束力；它是政权的债务，是统治者签订的个人债务，因此随着政权的倒台而消灭 。 ”	As Sack put it: “This debt does not bind the nation; it is a debt of the regime, a personal debt contracted by the ruler, and consequently it falls with the demise of the regime.”
实际上从成立之日起，有些观察家就对它超大的管理委员会可能带来的效率低下和不同国家利益可能造成的政策扭曲提出了质疑。	Indeed, when the ECB was established, some observers raised concerns even then about possible inefficiencies resulting from its supposedly outsized Governing Council and about possible distortions in its deliberations due to national considerations.
2014年，消费支出和商业投资继续保持这一增幅（第一季度除外，原因是极寒冬季所造成的天气影响 ） 。	Consumer spending and business investment continued at that rate in 2014 (except for the first quarter, owing to the weather-related effects of an exceptionally harsh winter).
由伊朗和沙特等敌对国家挑起的跨越国境的什叶和逊尼派分裂正在重新绘制中东的地缘政治版图，同样影响地区实力分布的还有外部力量干涉地区冲突。	The geopolitical map of the Middle East is being redrawn by the transnational Shia-Sunni split – which is being stoked by rivals such as Iran and Saudi Arabia – and by outside intervention into regional conflicts.
其后果已经开始显露：据2016年彭博创新指数，美国现在是世界上创新力第八的国家，比2015年的排名下降了两位。	The consequences are already starting to show: according to the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index, the US is now the world’s eighth most innovative country, having fallen two spots since 2015.
而米索前列醇（misoprostol）和米非司酮（mifepristone）等可由药剂师提供的药物的开发使得发展中国家的堕胎也可以变得相对安全和廉价。	And the development of the drugs misoprostol and mifepristone, which can be provided by pharmacists, makes relatively safe and inexpensive abortion possible in developing countries.
但是，不幸的是，海鲜业深受非法、不报告、不受监管的捕捞行为的困扰，这些行为破坏了保护措施，伤害了遵守规则的诚实渔民和企业。	Unfortunately, however, the industry is plagued by illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which undermines conservation efforts and handicaps honest fishers and businesses that follow the rules.
她向他表示祝贺，并承诺与其密切合作，但必须以“民主、自由、尊重法治和全体民众的尊严”等“共同价值观”为前提。	She congratulated him, and offered him a close working relationship, but only on the basis of “common values” such as “democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person.”
10,000美元的全民基本收入将带来实质区别；但是，取决于有多少人有资格获取，这将耗费GDP的10%到15 % — —一笔巨大的财政支出，特别是如果必须在现有社会计划的基础上额外发放的话。	An UBI of $10,000 would make a real difference; but, depending on how many people qualify, that could cost as much as 10% or 15% of GDP – a huge fiscal outlay, particularly if it came on top of existing social programs.
当加利福尼亚、伊利诺伊或明尼苏达等州陷入财政困境时，没人会指望其他州或联邦政府会援助它们，更不用说美联储担保或购买它们的债券了。	When US states like California, Illinois, or Minnesota get into fiscal trouble, no one expects the other states or the federal government to bail them out, let alone that the Federal Reserve will guarantee or purchase their bonds.
在她的前任多米尼克·斯特劳斯-卡恩（Dominique Strauss-Kahn）深陷丑闻后，批评者认为IMF决不能再一次因���类似事件而分心。	After the ugly scandal surrounding Dominique Strauss-Kahn, her predecessor at the Fund, the Fund, critics will insist, can’t afford such a distraction.
到目前为止，该地区报告25,791起病例，其中死亡病例10,689起 — — 几乎是此前各次埃博拉爆发死亡人数的总和。	The region has so far registered a total of 25,791 cases and 10,689 deaths – almost ten times the number of deaths from all other Ebola epidemics combined.
资金的充裕使得抵抗艾滋病、结核病和疟疾的项目得以启动、安全分娩得到了大普及，也增加了疫苗的覆盖面，小儿麻痹症基本上被消灭了。	The expanded funding allowed major campaigns against AIDS, TB, and malaria; a major scaling up of safe childbirth; and increased vaccine coverage, including the near-eradication of polio.
如果进口壁垒是以降低预算赤字（从而提高政府储蓄）的贸易税形式出现的话，贸易赤字可能会下降，而这种作用是通过预算而非贸易政策本身来实现的。	The trade deficit could fall if the import barriers were in the form of trade taxes that lowered the budget deficit (thereby raising government saving) but that effect would work through the budget, not through trade policy per se.
尽管存在上述种种问题，但如果它是追究大规模屠杀责任的唯一方式，针对种族灭绝提起诉讼或许依然是值得的。	Despite these problems, prosecuting genocide might be worthwhile if it were the only way to hold mass murderers accountable.
无怪乎新兴经济体会对金砖国家的新开发银行和中国领导的亚洲基础设施投资银行欢呼雀跃：这两家机构承诺可以更快地发放贷款。	No wonder emerging economies are excited by the establishment of the BRICS countries’ New Development Bank and the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: Both institutions have promised faster lending.
急速通胀曾经被广泛视为第一大经济问题，但在今天，大部分人 — — 至少大部分发达国家的人 — — 已经懒得关注它。	Whereas galloping inflation was once widely viewed as the number one economic problem, today most people – at least in the developed countries – hardly ever talk about it or even pay attention to it.
以希腊为例，总共需要三个希腊的生态资源和服务才能满足国内民众对粮食、纤维、木材、住房、城市基础设施和碳回收的需求。	Greece, for example, would need the total ecological resources and services of three Greeces in order to meet its citizens’ demand on nature for food, fiber, timber, housing, urban infrastructure, and carbon sequestration.
一方面，早在共和党中期选举胜利彻底扼杀又一轮刺激之前，即便在奥巴马政府内部，刺激也已经成为一个令人厌憎的词。	On one hand, stimulus had become a dirty word – even within the Obama administration – well before the Republicans’ mid-term election victory ruled out another round altogether.
从上世纪90年代初起，许多分析家就把美国松散的工会组织、任意的聘用关系、法律对工作的有限保护、以及频繁的工作变动视为失业率低于大多数欧盟国家的主要因素。	From the early 1990’s on, many analysts viewed America’s weak unionization, at-will employment, limited legal job protection, and high job turnover as major factors in achieving a lower unemployment rate than most EU countries.
对于那些现在就已经饱受金融动荡威胁的国家来说，全球贸易体系的破坏所带来的附带伤害将是巨大的，切避无可避。	For those countries that are already threatened by heightened financial instability, the collateral damage from a disruption to the global trading system would be significant and unavoidable.
然而金融市场行为管理局提案表明，上述假设或许不再是可靠了，至少在这个在脱欧道路上狂奔，以致于影响到伦敦金融城作为世界领先金融中心地位的英国就是如此。	The FCA proposal suggests that this assumption may no longer be credible, at least not in a United Kingdom hurtling toward Brexit, which has put the City of London’s reputation as a leading global financial center at risk.
欧盟与古巴政权开始进行对话，制裁也有条件地中止了，并且向持不同政见者清楚地表明好几个民主国家的大使馆并不欢迎他们。	The EU opened a dialogue with the Cuban regime, sanctions were conditionally suspended, and it was even made clear to dissidents that they were not welcome at the embassies of several democratic countries.
发自伦敦 — — 美国已故参议员丹尼尔·帕特里克·莫伊尼汉（Daniel Patrick Moynihan）曾说过一句名言 ： “ 每个人都构建自身观点的权利，却无权去捏造自己所认为的事实 。 ”	LONDON – The late US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said, “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” That may be true.
1970年时“无国界医生”组织的创始人贝尔纳·库什内（Bernard Kouchner）希望国际社会干涉尼日利亚事务，因为他看见尼日利亚政府军杀害伊博族人，就跟当年在奥斯维辛集中营发生的那样。	Bernard Kouchner, the founder of Doctors Without Borders, wanted the world to intervene in Nigeria in 1970, because he saw the killing of Ibos by Nigerian troops as a genocidal echo of Auschwitz.
在她的分析中，男人和女人分享他们有时差异巨大但通常又互为补充的优势符合所有人的利益 — — 这样的结论似乎很令人放心，而不是给人压力。	In her analysis, it serves everyone for men and women to share their sometimes different but often complementary strengths – a conclusion that seems reassuring, not oppressive.
最后的免责声明：资产价格并不总是由相信基本面决定并不等于相信基本面不重要，更不等于认为当前美国基本面状况良好。	A final disclaimer: believing that fundamentals do not always pin down asset prices is not the same as believing they are irrelevant, much less that current US fundamentals are in good shape.
尽管执政的少数族裔政权普遍对合计占总人口29%的基督徒、库尔德人和德鲁兹人持容忍态度，却长期压迫逊尼派多数族裔。	While the ruling minority has been generally tolerant of Christians, Kurds, Druze, and Turks, who together comprise 29% of the population, the regime has long oppressed the Sunni majority.
中国的私人经济学家又回到了过去他们最喜欢的经济压力期，也就是推算自己的GDP增长指标而不信任官方统计数字的时期。	There, private economists are back enjoying their favorite pastime during periods of economic stress, namely trying to construct their own indices for GDP growth as at such times they do not believe the official statistics.
上述状况在2005年发生了改变，世贸组织与贸易相关的知识产权协定（TRIPS）迫使印度建立了药品专利制度。	That changed in 2005, when the WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) forced India to allow drug patents.
事实上，你只要看一下2012年美国班加西领事馆遇袭后多年的评论情况 — — 充满了党派之争、风言风语和针锋相对 — — 的情况就理解领导人的担心之处了。	Indeed, one need only consider the years-long stream of commentary – characterized by partisanship, hearsay, and hostility – following the 2012 attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi to understand leaders’ angst.
但对于那些像我一样认为特朗普在贸易上的言论要比实际行动破坏性更大的人来说，这一切将最终引向何处是值得一再思考。	But those who, like me, thought Trump’s bark would be worse than his bite on trade are having second thoughts about where all of this might lead.
事实上，成立国际货币基金组织的主要一个原因是其能够监控汇率的发展情势，也就是要阻止任何国家实行“以邻为壑”政策。	In fact, one key reason for the creation of the International Monetary Fund was to monitor exchange-rate developments with the explicit aim of preventing beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
2015年他确保了与六国 — — 中国、法国、德国、俄罗斯、英国和美国 — — 以及欧盟达成协议，暂停伊朗核计划以换取经济援助。	And, in 2015, he secured a deal with six countries – China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – along with the European Union to halt Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for economic relief.
她在www.opendemocracy.net网站上汇报说，这一问题让戈尔措手不及，而且他也不支持这一观点。	The question, she reports on www.opendemocracy.net, seemed to take him by surprise, and he did not support the idea.
ampnbsp;ampnbsp;ampnbsp; 美国和整个世界还在面临一个结构性问题。 这个问题有点像上个世纪初的问题一样。	America, and the world, is also facing a major structural problem, not unlike that at the beginning of the last century, when productivity increases in agriculture meant that a rapidly declining share of the population could find work there.
新德里—中国外交部长王毅即将访问印度，并与印度新政府成员做首次会面，包括外交部长斯瓦拉吉（Sushma Swaraj）和更重要的总理莫迪。	NEW DELHI – Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s upcoming visit to India will include his first meetings with India’s new government, including Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and, more important, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
如今，希腊的欧洲债权人似乎准备放弃他们的庄严承诺 — — 不容废除欧元，而这样做只是为了坚持要求从希腊退休者手中抢点小钱。	Today, Greece’s European creditors seem ready to abandon their solemn pledges on the irrevocability of the euro in order to insist on collecting some crumbs from the country’s pensioners.
如今我们明白某些市场霸主其实都像《皇帝的新衣》中那样一丝不挂，而他们的行为也极为危险，足以导致极大的金融动荡并给纳税人带来极大损失，更别说突如其来的全球性衰退了。	We now know that some of these market emperors had no clothes, and that their activities, far from benign, could result in severe financial instability and generate serious losses for taxpayers, not to mention precipitating a global recession.
通过在1981年以后实行限制自由的“紧急状态法 ” ， 建立严格的审查制度和操纵选举，埃及的政府像对待奴隶一样压制埃及的国民。	By using the “emergency law,” which has restricted freedom since 1981, together with censorship and rigged elections, Egypt’s government treats its citizens like serfs.
更广义地说，新的“具有复杂性特征的世界观”必须承认人类行为会受到从政治和经济到文化和心理的各种因素的驱动，甚至受到技术发展本身的驱动。	More broadly, a new “complexity worldview” must appreciate that human behavior is driven by everything from politics and economics to culture and psychology – even by technology itself.
当然，当另一方合作时，背叛策略可能具有诱惑力，这样能够增加你自身的支付，甚至有可能带来笃定的意外之财。	Of course, when the other player is cooperating, it might be tempting to defect, in order to increase your own payoff and potentially even secure a windfall.
他刻意安排像1930年海边食盐长征这样的著名行动以缓慢的速度向前行进，这样的速度产生了紧张和戏剧效果。	He ensured that actions such as the famous 1930 salt march to the sea maintained a slow pace that allowed the drama and tension to build.
而共和党州长在俄亥俄和佛罗里达这样的主要州当选意味着选区可以加倍努力，提高特朗普在2020年竞选连任的机会。	And the election of Republican governors in major states like Ohio and Florida means that electoral districts can be finessed to boost Trump’s reelection chances in 2020.
我奔赴俄罗斯进一步了解了太空旅行（而不是新兴企业！ ）之后得出结论：实现太空旅行的最佳手段，就是在太空历险公司组织下接受俄罗斯联邦航天局的6个月太空训练。	I wanted to know more about space travel (not about startups!) and figured that six months of space training with Roskosmos, organized by Space Adventures, was the best way to get totally immersed.
幸运的是，某些企业似乎正在做出正确的选择，他们公开支持维持监管，特别是那些旨在缓解气候变化的相关规则。	Fortunately, some companies seem to be making the right choice, speaking out in support of maintaining regulations, especially those aimed at mitigating climate change.
即使希腊政府决定用它自己的白条或“新德拉克马”支付工资和退休金，欧洲法院（European Court of Justice）也将裁决所有本国债务和银行存款必须用欧元支付。	Even if the Greek government decides to pay wages and pensions by printing its own IOUs or “new drachmas,” the European Court of Justice will rule that all domestic debts and bank deposits must be repaid in euros.
但是，认为我的观点构成布什政府政策的智识根基的人并没有注意到我从1992年以来一直就民主和发展问题发表的看法。	But anyone who thinks that my ideas constitute the intellectual foundation for the Bush administration’s policies has not been paying attention to what I have been saying since 1992 about democracy and development.
但如果在问问题之前告诉受调查者实际上有多少外国人生活在美国，他们的观点就会发生重大改变：只有21%表示移民太多了。	But when respondents were told how many foreigners actually reside in the US before being asked that question, their views changed significantly: just 21% replied that there were too many.
他们的受教育程度不断提高，也更清楚公司如何运作。 当他们认为企业行为越界时，他们会比过去更加坦率和积极主动。	They are becoming more educated and aware of how companies operate, and they are more proactive and outspoken when they believe a company has crossed the line.
由于从它们的纠纷和分析中产生的解决方案是技术官僚 — — 而非民主 — — 进程的产物，因此可能引起民粹主义者的抵制。	Given that the solutions that emerge from their disputations and analyses will be the product of technocratic – not democratic – processes, they are likely to trigger populist backlashes.
仅仅在一年前，前首相野田佳彦试图在深度衰退的情况下提高消费税而不放松货币 — — 这一做法的唯一效果是延长经济停滞。	Just a year ago, former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda attempted, despite a deep recession, to raise the consumption tax without monetary easing – a strategy that could have brought only continued economic stagnation.
在墨西哥刚刚进行完的总统大选的三个主要候选人中，没有哪个像人称AMLO的获胜者安德烈斯·马努艾尔·洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔那样在应对来自白宫的恶霸方面准备不足。	Of the three main contenders in Mexico’s just-completed presidential election, none was as ill-prepared as the winner, Andrés Manuel López Obrador – AMLO, as he is known – to manage the bully in the White House.
比方说，如果把非全日制雇工和就业意愿丧失者（discouraged workers）也计算在内，美国的失业率就会高达16.5 % 。	If you include partially employed workers and discouraged workers who left the US labor force, for example, the unemployment rate is already 16.5%.
相反，他很可能将提出用中国在朝鲜问题上的合作来换取美国停止在韩国部署末段高空区域防御（即萨德）反导系统。	Instead, he will probably offer China’s cooperation in exchange for the US halting its deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea.
尽管国会功能失调，私营部门将会逐渐将一个瘫痪不确定的溢价 — — 这妨碍了很多投资 — — 转化成一种破坏性更小的风险溢价。	Notwithstanding a dysfunctional Congress, the private sector will increasingly convert a paralyzing uncertainty premium, which impedes much investment, into a less disruptive risk premium.
发自安大略 — — 十二月，世界各地的贸易部长将齐聚布宜诺斯艾利斯参加世界贸易组织（WTO）第十一次部长级会议。	ONTARIO – This December, trade ministers from around the world will converge in Buenos Aires for the World Trade Organization’s 11th Ministerial Conference.
土耳其、埃及和沙特阿拉伯（已经与巴基斯坦在核方面展开紧密合作）等地区力量未来拥有临界（threshold）核能力的可能性大增。	A future in which regional powers like Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia (which has worked closely with Pakistan on the nuclear front) possess threshold nuclear capabilities is becoming more likely that ever.
比方说在德黑兰，改革派人士赢得了所有席位，从而保证现任市长 — — 这位市长本人也是一位保守派总统候选人 — — 很快就会失去这一职位。	In Tehran, for example, the reformist slate won every seat, ensuring that the current mayor – himself a conservative presidential candidate – will soon be out of a job.
在现实中，德国无法承担所有欧洲外围国债务而不影响其自身的偿债能力和信誉，特别是在有效的泛欧元区制衡机制缺位的情况下。	In reality, Germany could not have underwritten all of the European periphery’s debt without risking its own solvency and creditworthiness, particularly in the absence of a functioning system of eurozone-wide checks and balances.
著名经济学家肯尼斯·阿罗（Kenneth Arrow）强调干中学（learning by doing）的重要性。	The great economist Kenneth Arrow emphasized the importance of learning by doing.
普京的偏执政策 — — 向东看，同时对西方发动非常规战争 — — 将把俄罗斯引向中国加油站，同时切断俄罗斯经济与其所需要的西方资本、技术和合同。	Putin’s illiberal strategy of looking East while waging unconventional war on the West will turn Russia into China’s gas station while cutting off its economy from the Western capital, technology, and contacts that it needs.
类似地，马可尼在长途无线电传输方面的工作原本只是为了与电报竞争；他从未构想过广播电台和现代无线通讯。	Likewise, Guglielmo Marconi’s work on long-distance radio transmission was intended simply to create competition for the telegraph; Marconi never envisioned broadcast radio stations or modern wireless communication.
另一个主要担忧是，如果企业不再能够“走后门 ” — —即贿赂官员允许他们规避过度监管 — — 业绩将受到影响。	Another major concern is that, if businesses are no longer able to “grease the wheels” – that is, bribe officials to allow them to circumvent excessive regulations – their performance could suffer.
总统公子的兴趣据称还包括与文化部长胡斯尼串通一气走私毒品和非法出口古埃及的文化遗产¾珍贵古董，而文化部长则在交易中充当他们的保护伞。	The sons’ interests allegedly also include forays into drug smuggling and illegal exports of archaeological treasures – Egypt’s cultural heritage – in partnership with Culture Minister Faruq Husni, who is supposed to safeguard them.
尽管近期的挑战 — — 尤其是意大利与欧盟委员会的预算争夺战 — — 显示这样的结果距离得到保障还相去甚远，但它仍然是抵制民粹主义崛起的最为可靠的平衡力量。	While recent challenges – not least Italy’s budget battle with the European Commission – indicate that such an outcome is far from assured, it remains the most credible counterweight to the rise of populism.
乐观主义者指出，自1990年代起中国一直奉行友好的邻交政策，解决了边境争端，在国际机构中扮演越来越重要的角色，并且认识到了使用软力量的益处。	Optimists point out that China has engaged in good neighbor policies since the 1990’s, settled border disputes, played a greater role in international institutions, and recognized the benefits of using soft power.
在这一技术跨越之下，发展中国家的贫困民众无需花大价钱购买固定电话以及其他基础设施就可获得长途通信服务。	In a clear case of technological leapfrogging, they have given poor people in developing countries access to long-distance communications without the need for costly investments in landlines and other infrastructure.
他似乎还意犹未尽，最近又发布行政令要求政府机构撤销奥巴马时代的清洁电力计划。 该计划的目的是限制来自燃煤电厂的排放和促进可再生能源。	As if that were not enough, he recently issued an executive order instructing government agencies to roll back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which was designed to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants, and promote renewable energies.
如果我们对英国在战后世界上真正的分量目光稍微敏锐一点并且诚实一些的话，英国本该在欧洲事务中扮演一个更核心的角色，使形成中的欧盟更符合我们国家的利益。	A little more sharp-eyed honesty about Britain’s real weight in the post-war world might have enabled us British to play a more central role in Europe’s affairs, molding the emerging European Union more closely to our own national interests.
大西洋盆地半个世纪以来第一次出现了石油盈余 — — 即生产超过消费，这让太平洋盆地成为仅存的石油净流入地区。	The Atlantic Basin ran an oil surplus – producing more than it consumed – for the first time in a half-century, while the Pacific Basin became the only dumping ground for crude.
换言之，格林斯潘是否应该将利率维持在一个更高的水平上，给过热的经济降降温，以避免房地产市场泡沫的增长？	In other words, should Greenspan have kept interest rates higher and triggered a recession in order to avert the growth of a housing bubble?
另一个伊斯兰教运动 — — 阿尔及利亚的伊斯兰拯救阵线在1991年几乎迎来了这样一次机会。 它赢得了第一轮大选。	Another Islamist movement, Algeria’s Islamic Salvation Front, almost had such an opportunity in 1991, when it won the first round of a general election.
如果认为成千上万平民百姓的死亡、再加上强制监禁和折磨没有为伊拉克境内大肆蔓延的恐怖活动推波助澜，无疑将犯下致命的错误。	It would be a mistake to believe that the deaths of thousands of civilians, along with arbitrary imprisonment and torture, do not contribute to the spread of terror in Iraq.
但是研究的目的似乎只是为了给恢复商业捕鲸提供一个科学的依据；因此，既然捕鲸是不符合伦理的，那么研究本身既不必要也是不符合伦理的。	But the research seems to be aimed at building a scientific case for a resumption of commercial whaling; so, if whaling is unethical, then the research itself is both unnecessary and unethical.
现在，空缺职位和申请人数之比高于历史均值，但因为自动化正在取代人工并压低工资，行政等岗位的就业比率依然很低，甚至低于50 % 。	The job vacancy-to-applicant ratio now stands above parity, though it does remain low – even below 50% – in jobs such as clerical work, where automation is replacing workers and suppressing wages.
即使在国家商品和服务税公布之前，印度的司法系统已经充斥着形形色色的间接税诉讼，累及总值约230亿美元的税收。	Even before the GST was rolled out, the Indian judicial system was choked by indirect tax appeals, tying down some $23 billion in tax revenue.
之后，欧盟各国政府降低了条件，声称俄罗斯只要从这两个地区以外的格鲁吉亚领土上撤军就够了，可以继续有关PCA、能源安全和其他问题的对话。	Since then, EU governments have moderated their conditions, describing a simple Russian military withdrawal from Georgian territories outside the two regions as sufficient to resume a dialogue on the PCA, energy security, and other issues.
事实上，从1996年到2009年，农场收入增加了近6500万美元，因为生物技术作物通过提高亩产和（在阿根廷）实现双季种植将玉米和大豆产量分别提高了1.3亿吨和8300万吨。	Indeed, farm income grew by nearly $65 million from 1996 to 2009, as biotech crops increased global corn and soybean production by 130 million and 83 million tons, respectively, owing to higher yields and, in Argentina, second cropping of soybeans.
法兰克福 — — 说到改革今天的西方资本主义制度，人们一直对监管体系全面性及系统性的失灵故意视而不见。	FRANKFURT – A systematic and broad failure of regulation is the elephant in the room when it comes to reforming today’s Western capitalism.
墨西哥城—刚刚去世的委内瑞拉总统查韦斯的支持者，甚至还有许多他的批评者，都一再强调他身前的两大成就。	MEXICO CITY – Supporters of Hugo Chávez, the recently deceased Venezuelan president, and even many of his critics, have repeatedly emphasized two supposed achievements that will burnish his legacy.
IPCC对几种情况做了评估，其中一种可以把未来气温的升高限制在2.0-2.4˚C之间，但要求必须在2015年之前达到排放高峰，然后逐步减少。	Several scenarios have been assessed by the IPCC, and one that would limit future temperature increase to between 2.0-2.4˚C would require that emissions peak no later than 2015, and decline thereafter.
事实上，他的加强埃塞俄比亚卫生系统的措施令埃塞俄比亚妇女获得避孕手段的比例翻了一番，令产妇死亡率下降了75 % 。	In fact, his efforts to strengthen Ethiopia’s health system played a crucial role in more than doubling the percentage of Ethiopian women with access to contraception, and in reducing maternal mortality by 75%.
如果将这一方针应用于包括在国际社会的下一个发展日程中的所有目标，可以肯定2030年的世界将远比现在更加美好。	This approach, if applied to all of the goals included in the international community’s next development agenda, would ensure that the world of 2030 is a much better place.
韩国强人、现任总统朴槿惠的父亲朴正熙在多种意义上是我们现在在中国和俄罗斯所看���的类型社会的先驱。	South Korea’s strongman, Park Chung-hee, current President Park Geun-hye’s father, was in many ways a pioneer of the type of society that we now see in China and Russia.
任何没有意识到即将到来的“大火”的人，只要听一听美联储主席耶伦最近在国会山所受到的诘难便可略知一二。	Anyone unaware of the incoming fire only had to listen to the grilling Fed Chair Janet Yellen received recently on Capitol Hill.
换句话说，目前希腊能够为其当前水平的消费和投资（包括政府和私人支出）融资，不需要依靠来自世界其他部分的资本流入。	Stated differently, Greece is now able to finance its current level of consumption and investment, including government and private spending, without relying on capital inflows from the rest of the world.
发自华盛顿特区 — — 前美国财政部长劳伦斯·萨默斯（Lawrence H. Summers）最近打趣说 : “ 财政刺激就像一种存在耐受性的药物；为了保持持续增长，就必须得让赤字不断扩大 。 ”	WASHINGTON, DC – Former US Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers recently quipped that, “Fiscal stimulus is like a drug with tolerance effects; to keep growth constant, deficits have to keep getting larger.”
因投资者在普遍的不确定性中寻找稳定性，道琼斯工业平均指数、标准普尔500指数和纳斯达克综合指数最近纷纷创出历史新高，新兴经济体金融市场表现也很强劲。	The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq composite index have all reached record highs lately, with emerging-economy financial markets also performing strongly, as investors search for stability amid widespread uncertainty.
因为法律系统降低了穆斯林肆意违反合同的难度，导致他们往往更倾向于拖欠债务和违背作为商业伙伴和卖方的职责。	Because the legal system made it easier for Muslims to breach contracts with impunity, they were more often tempted to default on their debts and to renege on their obligations as business partners and sellers.
因此有5年时间，我享受着为数以万计学子授予学位的体验，并亲眼目睹了这样的仪式对学子和他们的家庭意味着什么。	So for five years I enjoyed the experience of giving tens of thousands of students their degrees and watching what this rite of passage meant for them and their families.
这些女性经常会假定，只要比周围的人付出多一倍的努力 — — 但坚决不为她们自己的价值或成就辩护 — — 就会带来收入的提高，因为自己的上级会看在眼里的。	They frequently assume that working twice as hard as those around them – while never speaking up for their own worth or accomplishments – will generate a raise because an authority figure will notice.
相反，大部分公共服务没有价格，其供给也不应该有利润动机，资本市场也不是为了选择为哪些公共服务提供资金：只要进入了预算，就能获得资金。	By contrast, most public services have no prices, there is not supposed to be a profit motive in their provision, and capital markets are not supposed to choose what to fund: the money funds whatever is in the budget.
比如，在美国发生于二十世纪八十年代后期的房地产泡沫破裂中，许多发放抵押贷款的银行（储蓄和住宅贷款金融机构）彻底破产，从而引发了1990和1991年间的银行危机、信贷紧缩和经济衰退。	For example, during the housing bust in the United States in the late 1980’s, many banks that were mortgage lenders (the Savings ampamp; Loans Associations) went belly up, leading to a banking crisis, a credit crunch, and a recession in 1990-1991.
澳大利亚、加拿大、以色列、新西兰和很多欧洲国家现在推行一种公共出借权，旨在为因著作被收入公共图书馆所导致的销售损失向作者和出版社提供补偿。	Australia, Canada, Israel, New Zealand, and many European countries now have a public lending right, designed to compensate authors and publishers for the loss of sales caused by the presence of their books in public libraries.
最后，尽管许多新兴市场经济体保有经常项目盈余，但越来越多的新兴经济体 — — 包括土耳其、南非、巴西和印度 — — 出现了赤字。	Finally, while many emerging-market economies tend to run current-account surpluses, a growing number of them – including Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, and India – are running deficits.
如果债务援助方案要求一国经济、社会和政治模式发生全面的变化，那么最好的行动方案可能是减记私人损失，而不是用公共资金覆盖私人损失。	If a debt bailout program requires a wholesale change in a country’s economic, social, and political model, the best course of action might be to write off the private losses, rather than pour in public money to cover them.
而最为锦上添花的则是贸易数据 — — 相对于在2016年第四季度的年同比下跌5.2％的出口数据，1月和2月实现了4%的增长。	But the icing on the cake came from the trade data – namely, annual export growth of 4% in January and February, following a 5.2% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2016.
其他地方的车辆也缓慢向前爬行，试图躲避一个又一个水坑，不时有骑马塔图小巴的上班族因为粗心大意而跌进水坑。	Elsewhere, vehicles creep along slowly, bouncing from crater to crater, while the carless get tossed around in matatu minibuses as they travel to and from work.
若非如此，欧洲央行将停止支持希腊银行体系，希腊政府也将没钱维持外债，更糟糕的是，希腊政府也将没钱支付希腊公民的退休金和工资。	If not, the ECB will stop supporting the Greek banking system, and the government will run out of money to service foreign debts and, more dramatically, to pay Greek citizens their pensions and wages.
中国甚至在葡萄牙和希腊等陷入困境的欧元区国家都收购了基础设施 — — 中国此举反应了欧洲战略思考的欠缺。	It has even acquired infrastructure in distressed eurozone countries like Portugal and Greece – a move that reflects a lack of strategic thinking on Europe’s part.
但整个欧洲的政府多年来都在遏制基础设施支出，在政府借贷挤出私人投资、降低增长的误导信念下，财政紧缩和减少债务才是重点。	Yet governments across Europe have clamped down on infrastructure spending for years, giving precedence to fiscal austerity and debt reduction in the misguided belief that government borrowing crowds out private investment and reduces growth.
其中的模式是显而易见的：当今的发达国家以前也发生过迁离劳动密集型制造业的情况，总部设在欧洲、日本和美国的公司将生产线迁往发展中国家。	The pattern is clear: this sort of transition away from labor-intensive manufacturing happened before in today’s developed countries, when firms headquartered in Europe, Japan, and the United States moved production to developing countries.
而在这一冰川融化��点被揭露为毫无依据之后，印度政府的反应则是在本月初宣布计划建立本国自己的“政府间气候变化专门委员会”来评估全球变暖的影响。	Earlier this month, the Indian government reacted to the revelations about the baseless nature of the glacier claim by announcing plans to establish what amounts to its own “Indian IPCC” to assess the impact of global warming.
有时候是一方内部温和派和激进派之间的公开冲突，例如正当和平谈判取得进展之际，一名以色列宗教狂热分子暗杀了以色列总理拉宾。	Sometimes this involves overt conflict between moderates and radicals within one side, such as when an Israeli religious zealot assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin when peace negotiations were making progress.
澳大利亚、博茨瓦纳、中国、墨西哥、挪威、卢旺达、沙特阿拉伯和英国等国家都在使用GBD数据指导卫生政策。	Countries such as Australia, Botswana, China, Mexico, Norway, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom are using GBD findings to inform health policies.
在政治领域，改革者们熟知英美的想法和机构，却有意走德国的路子，因为他们认为一个君主的政治体制更适合日本。	In the political realm, Meiji reformers were well aware of Anglo-American ideas and institutions, but deliberately turned to German models because they were deemed more suitable to a country with an emperor.
预计今年晚些时候的巴黎会议上各国将提交国家计划 — — 也叫国家决定计划（INDCs ） — —概述将为降低二氧化碳排放采取的具体步骤。	During the proceedings in Paris later this year, countries will be expected to present national plans – known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) – outlining the specific steps they will take to reduce CO2 emissions.
要想知道未来会是怎样一种景象，我们只须到北京、雅典、东京，或者，事实上，地球上几乎任何一个城市去看一看就明白了。	To peek into the future, all we have to do is go to Beijing, Athens, Tokyo, or, in fact, just about any city on Earth.
核事故、公众反对和高投资成本已经导致核能投资急剧下降；20世纪70年代后期以来，美国再没有委托建造任何核电厂。	Nuclear accidents, public opposition, and high capital costs have already provoked a drastic drop in nuclear-energy investment; in the United States, no nuclear-power plant has been commissioned since the late 1970’s.
慕尼黑—随着关于所谓的直升机撒钱的可能形式的新概念的出现，对其是否值得考虑的长期争论形势也发生了变化，并且出现了直升机撒钱是否已在某些经济体落地的疑问。	MUNICH – The long-running debate about the advisability of so-called helicopter money has changed shape, as new ideas emerge about the form it could take – and questions arise about whether it is already being dropped on some economies.
他的言辞引申出一种更广泛的感觉：CEO们“不食人间烟火 ” ， 不愿或无法就尖锐问题给出真诚的回答。	His words tapped into a wider feeling that CEOs are out of touch and unwilling, or unable, to respond to tough questions with sincere answers.
事实上，尽管决策者的注意力发生了变化，来自新兴经济体的竞争也日趋激烈，但欧洲国家的制造业表现仍位居世界前列，这是因为许多企业成功地实现了适应和创新。	In fact, despite policymakers’ shift in focus and emerging-economy competition, European countries remain among the world’s top performers in manufacturing, owing to the many firms that have managed to adapt and innovate.
他在议会两院都拥有绝对多数，应能确保任何需要的改革立法 — — 如果他能维持自民党内部纪律的话（他的高支持度对他有利 ） 。	With strong majorities in both houses, he should be able to secure whatever reform legislation he needs – that is, provided that he can maintain the LDP’s internal discipline (his enormous popularity will help him).
利用生物指标，制药公司所设计的临床研究可以显示出试验药物和对比疗法（通常是无效对照剂，但有时也会是另一种疗法）之间的高度“相对疗法区别 ” 。	They can help drug makers to design clinical studies that will show a high “relative treatment difference” between the drug and whatever it is being compared to (often a placebo, but sometimes another treatment).
克里姆林宫支持的Rossiya 1电视网络工作人员马拉可夫（Andrei Malakhov）正在叙利亚拍摄关于菲利波夫的纪录片。	Andrei Malakhov, a television personality on the Kremlin-affiliated Rossiya 1 TV network, is now in Syria shooting a documentary about Filipov.
但通过将所有人的知识，经验和资源集合在一起，并重新建立一个负责任，有效且包容的多边体系，我们就可以为每个人重新带来一个更加光明和繁荣的未来。	But by combining our knowledge, experiences, and resources, and by recommitting to a responsible, effective, and inclusive multilateral system, we can reclaim a brighter and more prosperous future for everyone.
更糟糕的是，增加社会开支对解决该国17.5%的惊人失业率 — — 主要是结构上的 — — 几乎没有什么助益，而在短时间内采用欧元的希望也将破灭。	Worse, boosting social spending will contribute little to resolving the country’s staggering 17.5% rate of unemployment – most of it structural –while any hope of quick euro adoption will be dashed.
此人与共产主义时代毫无瓜葛，他把所有前共产党员都从重要位置上赶下了台，甚至禁止前总理莱舍克·米莱尔参与议会选举。	He has nothing to do with the communist era and has sacked all former Party members from important positions, even barring former Prime Minister Leszek Miller from standing for parliament.
当菲律宾去年春季禁止向外国人出售肾脏之后 ， 《 耶路撒冷邮报》出现了这样的大字标题 ： “ 菲律宾关闭大门之后, Limbo的肾移植候选者 ” 。	Last spring, after the Philippines banned the sale of kidneys to foreigners, a headline in the Jerusalem Post read, “Kidney Transplant Candidates in Limbo after Philippines Closes Gates.”
英国、加拿大、芬兰、法国、希腊和葡萄牙 — — 它们都存在巨大的贸易赤字 — — 储蓄远远少于其他发达国家。	The United Kingdom, Canada, Finland, France, Greece, and Portugal – all of which have large trade deficits – save much less than other developed countries.
他们最先拆解的是丝状支原体，这既是一种能感染牛羊的寄生菌同时又是生殖支原体的近亲，其在独立存活细菌中拥有的基因数量最少 — — 仅有525个基因。	They started with the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, a parasitic bacteria that infects cattle and goats, and also a close relative of Mycoplasma genitalium, which has the fewest genes – just 525 – known among free-living bacteria.
这样一个协定可以包括商品、服务、金融工具和农业方面的贸易，也将成为增加欧洲和美国监管和法律规范兼容性的必要条件，这意味着省下大笔资金。	Such an agreement could include trade in goods, services, financial instruments, and agriculture, and would necessitate greater compatibility of European and American regulations and legal norms, implying substantial savings.
与此同时，政府也宣布了一份规模巨大的资本重组计划（大约相当于GDP的1.2 % ） ，旨在巩固公共部门银行，以使它们能够购销不良资产。	Meanwhile, the government has also announced a large recapitalization package (about 1.2% of GDP) to shore up public-sector banks, so that they can write down their stressed assets.
如果我们继续走现在的路线，那将不会有足够的科技进步来确保非碳源能源在价格和效能上的竞争力相对于化石燃料占得上风。	If we continue on our current path, technological development will be nowhere near significant enough to make non-carbon-based energy sources competitive with fossil fuels on price and effectiveness.
因此，比起公正地评价其他国家，极权主义或者独裁主义国家更愿意花力气掩饰他们自己的镇压，更容易为了反对那些让诸多独裁者头痛不已的民主体制而发动某种政治屠杀。	So totalitarian or authoritarian states – more interested in hiding their own oppression than fairly judging other nations – can easily trigger a sort of political pogrom against any democracy that annoys enough tyrants.
关于此类事项持往往保守姿态（主要是为了避免得罪各大国政府）的国际货币基金组织估计，中国向非金融企业的贷款中有15％处于危险之中。	The International Monetary Fund, which tends to adopt a conservative posture on such matters (not least to avoid antagonizing powerful governments), estimates that 15% of Chinese loans to nonfinancial corporations are at risk.
如果中国不划定防空识别区 — — 这是一个不祥的预兆，侵占了东海上空非中方控制区域的国际空域 — — 安倍也许将继续保持原来的立场。	He may well have maintained that stance had China not established the ADIZ, which set an ominous new precedent by usurping international airspace over the East China Sea, including areas that China does not control.
哈佛医学院的马克·柯什纳（Marc Kirschner）在《科学》杂志中发表了一篇思想深刻的社论，他指出 ， “ 你也许能在好科学发生时认出它，但重要的科学只能在后视镜里看到 。 ”	As Marc Kirschner, a professor at Harvard Medical School, pointed out in a thoughtful editorial in the journal Science: “One may be able to recognize good science as it happens, but significant science can only be viewed in the rear-view mirror.”
当年美国前总统比尔·克林顿尝试召开第二次戴维营峰会，已故的巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿拉法特却对此感到迟疑。	When former US president Bill Clinton tried to set up the second Camp David summit, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hesitated. He felt that the situation was not right for direct talks.
这使他们能够收集大量的经济租金，特别是在预生产（包括设计）和后期制作（营销和品牌）阶段，正是这两部分产生了最大的增值和利润。	These enable them to collect massive economic rents, especially at the pre-production (including design) and post-production (marketing and branding) stages, where the most value-added and profit is generated.
目前看来，欧洲正在经历一场幅度不大但较为显著的经济增长，令人不禁猜测政策制定者会否利用这个机会来寻求必要的改革。	As it happens, Europe is currently experiencing a modest but significant surge in growth. But whether policymakers will take advantage of this opportunity to pursue needed reforms is anyone’s guess.
我们看到停下脚步伸出援手的路人；救护伤者的护士和医生；失踪人员搜索者，还有人留宿受害者的家人，或者将人们从大规模屠杀的现场护送回家中。	It is manifested in the passers-by who stop to help; in the nurses and doctors who attend to the injured; and in those who search for the lost, offer families a bed for the night, or escort people home from the scene of a mass murder.
在后来的沙特阿拉伯，英国支持的伊本·沙特的瓦哈比原教旨主义击败了哈希姆·希贾兹领导的阿拉伯民族主义运动。	In what would become Saudi Arabia, Britain backed the Wahhabi fundamentalism of Ibn Saud over the Arab nationalism of the Hashemite Hejaz.
在其自传性作品《昨日的世界 》 （ The World of Yesterday）中，斯特凡·茨威格（Stefan Zweig）描述了一个类似的急剧变化。	In his autobiography The World of Yesterday, Stefan Zweig described a similarly drastic change.
同一报告还指出，每年有超过30万15—19岁女孩和妇女死于与妊娠有关的状况，更多妇女和女孩因衰竭而致残。	The same report notes that more than 300,000 girls and women aged 15-19 die every year from pregnancy-related complications, while many more are left to deal with debilitating disabilities.
但是普善的思想实在是太抽象了，而西方帝国主义者以及跟随他们而来的基督教传教士那种不受欢迎的干涉在东方国家所造成的恶劣影响却是他们久久不能忘怀的。	But the idea of universal charity is too abstract, and smacks of the kind of unwelcome interference that Western imperialists – and the Christian missionaries who followed them – practiced in the East for too long.
中日两国都小心谨慎地对待这次访问，世界其他国家也一直在密切关注这次访问的行程，其原因显而易见：过去10年来的中日关系一直充满了各种各样的动荡，这恐怕还是最缓和的说法。	The trip is being carefully managed by both countries, and is being watched closely around the world, with good reason: Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent, to say the least.
正如坐飞机一样，尽管大部分人都不是特别喜欢（乔治·克鲁尼那个角色除外 ） ， 但乘客为了收集积分也是乐于登记成为会员的。	Just as with flying, which most people (George Clooney’s character excepted) don’t particularly like, users may eagerly sign up in order to collect points.
在后来的几年里，美国又使用了其他的延迟策略，这些策略就是在海地似乎快要满足其要求的时候，和泛美开发银行一起改变目标标杆。	In subsequent years, the US employed additional delaying tactics, working with the IDB to move the goal posts whenever Haiti appeared to be meeting their demands.
如果将个人养老金或公积金投资于GDP连动式债券，退休者在25年间的收入将会反映出经济和税基的增长率 — — 到那个时候，一切将合乎情理。	If personal pension accounts or provident funds are invested in GDP-linked bonds, the payments that retirees receive in 25 years will reflect the growth rate of the economy – and that of the tax base – to that date, which all makes good sense.
中国也认识到其对煤炭的严重依赖正在造成了能导致重大生命损失的灾难性的污染和雾霾，主要煤炭消费地区预期寿命将下降五年之多。	China, for its part, has realized that its heavy dependence on coal is causing such devastating pollution and smog that it is leading to massive loss of life, with life expectancy down as much as five years in regions with heavy coal consumption.
这样一套系统可以满足5V手机低压直流充电、以及12V LED照明、户外水泵及电脑电视等各式家电的用电需求。	Such a system can supply low-voltage DC electric power at five volts for mobile phones, and 12V for LED lighting, pumps for outdoor use, and electrical appliances such as computers and televisions.
如果民主党人接管众议院，那么新授权的委员会主席将会拿到传票，并将广泛调查涉嫌贪污行为的一系列行政行为和机构。	Should the Democrats take over the House, newly empowered committee chairmen, armed with subpoenas, will launch investigations of a broad range of administration actions and agencies, where extensive corruption is suspected.
结果，从1997年到2007年，瑞典的出口几乎翻倍，工业生产增长了36 ％ ， 制造业公司生产力的增长创出了历史新高。	As a result, from 1997 to 2007, Swedish exports nearly doubled and industrial production grew by 36%, with manufacturing companies achieving record-high productivity growth.
但真正的焦点集中在《指数气候行动路线图上 》 ， 这项重大新研究表明，在使用非化石燃料技术等方面的进展以指数而不是线性的方式推进。	But the real focus was on the Exponential Climate Action Roadmap, a major new study showing that progress in the use of non-fossil-fuel technologies is advancing not just linearly, but exponentially.
如果英拉被政变推翻，或泰国民主因为阻止她重新掌权而被架空，那么他信和英拉所属的西那瓦（Shinawatra）家族将别无选择，只能向中国寻求支持。	Should Yingluck be ousted in a coup, or should the country’s democracy be hollowed out to preclude her return to power, the Shinawatras may be left with no choice but to seek support from Thailand’s giant neighbor to the north.
“我们通过建立独立于美国的支付渠道、欧洲货币基金以及独立的SWIFT系统来提高欧洲的自治力至关重要 。 ” 马斯说。	It is “indispensable that we strengthen European autonomy by creating payment channels that are independent of the United States, a European Monetary Fund, and an independent SWIFT system,” according to Maas.
本月，IMF独立评估办公室发布了一份对IMF储备累积政策的评估报告，报告显示 ， “ 放之四海而皆准”的储备累积方法仍在IMF内部占据主流。	This month, the IMF’s Independent Evaluation Office released an assessment of the Fund’s policy on reserve accumulation that implies that a “one size fits all” approach to reserve accumulation continues to prevail within the organization.
在未来几年中，没有什么核子经验的发展中国家例如印尼、越南、泰国、约旦、土耳其、埃及以及其他国家都将试图发展核能。	In coming years, developing countries with little nuclear experience – Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and others – will attempt to leap onto the atomic bandwagon.
奥巴马应该急切地想强调将印度排除在TPP之外完全是因为地理因素 — — 印度不在太平洋沿岸 — — 并且美国希望加强双边贸易和美国企业的直接投资。	Obama should be eager to stress that India’s exclusion from the TPP is a matter solely of geography – India does not abut the Pacific – and that the US wants to increase bilateral trade and direct investment by American firms.
世界银行经济学家克莱普尔（Leora Klapper）和洛夫（Inessa Love）的一篇出色论文指出，金融危机的重大后果之一是企业家不再愿意创办新企业。	An engaging paper by the World Bank economists Leora Klapper and Inessa Love shows that one major consequence of the financial crisis has been entrepreneurs’ reluctance to start new firms.
这也阻碍了对持续破坏这一重要多边组织整体性，可靠性以及有效性的治理及代表性缺失状况的解决（虽然依然较为温和 ） 。	It is also being held back from addressing, albeit modestly, governance and representation deficits that have steadily eroded the integrity, credibility, and effectiveness of this important multilateral institution.
此外，尽管打击恐怖主义的国际合作很有裨益，但其影响受狐疑和互不信任的掣肘，波士顿马拉松爆炸案已经证明了这一点。	And, while international cooperation to combat terrorism is useful, its impact is constrained by suspicion and mistrust, as the Boston Marathon bombings highlighted.
正如罗伯特·施密德（Robert Schmidle ） ， 迈克尔·苏梅耶（Michael Sulmeyer）和本·布恰南（Ben Buchanan）所指出的那样 ： “ 从来没有人被通过网络杀死过 。 ”	As Robert Schmidle, Michael Sulmeyer, and Ben Buchanan put it, “No one has ever been killed by a cyber capability.”
但基础设施私人投资对于中国这样的国家也是至关重要的，因为它能带来市场的力量和活力，从而改善资本配置、增加透明度。	But private investment in infrastructure remains vital even in countries like China, because it brings the power and dynamism of the market, which improves the allocation of capital and promotes transparency.
但在这里，同样存在各种因素制约军事方针的效果，尽管这并没有阻止副总统彭斯最近说出“所有选项都已经摆上台面”的话。	"Yet here, too, there are constraints on what a military approach can achieve, though that didn’t stop Vice President Mike Pence from saying recently that ""all options are on the table.”"
不无讽刺的是，我们正遭遇着一种怪异的“民族自豪感”的逆转：正如文化和体育明星们被国家利用，作为集体的世袭财产。	We are encountering, not without irony, a kind of grotesque reverse of the “national pride” seen when cultural and sporting stars are appropriated by the state and presented as part of the collective patrimony.
如今，在经历了野蛮的20世纪上半叶、短暂的冷战双极格局和1989年后美国单一超级大国阶段后，世界正在再一次寻找新的国际秩序。	Today, after the brutality of the first half of the twentieth century, the temporary bipolarity of the Cold War, and America’s brief post-1989 hyperpower status, the world is once again searching for a new international order.
在欧洲，克里姆林宫一直能够追求成功的分而治之（divide-and-rule）战略，匈牙利暂停向乌克兰输气的决定就是显著的例子。	In Europe, the Kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy, particularly in view of Hungary’s decision to suspend gas flows to Ukraine.
另一方面，我认为这些前共和党支持卡西奇不会有任何困难，他是一位成功的保守派州长，其主要动机绝不是恨人，不管是党内的人还是民主党的人。	On the other hand, I don’t imagine those former Republicans would have had any difficulty endorsing Kasich, a successful conservative governor whose primary motivation is plainly not hating people, whether in his own party or in the Democratic Party.
在接下来的十年中朝鲜进行了五次核试验 — — 最近那次在今年9月 — — 并展示了开发先进热核武器所需的精湛技术。	In the ensuing decade, North Korea has conducted five more nuclear tests – most recently in September – and demonstrated the technological mastery needed to develop advanced thermonuclear weapons.
首先，在充满了领土争端和激烈程度不亚于阿拉伯-以色列冲突的历史恩怨的亚洲，美国面临着缺少安全结构和一致的冲突解决机制的地缘政治环境。	For starters, in a region replete with territorial disputes and old rivalries that are as bitter as the Arab-Israeli conflict, America faces a geopolitical environment with no security architecture and no agreed conflict-resolution mechanism.
发展并不是解决暴力问题的灵丹妙药，并且可能会制造它自己的悲伤情绪，尤其是在没有充分考虑它可能给社会带来的突然变化。	Development is no miracle solution to violence, and may create its own set of grievances – particularly when done without regard to the abrupt changes it brings to societies.
如果共和党得到了他们想要的立法胜利，那么整个国家 — — 也许最富有的一小撮人是例外 — — 都会是输家。	Should Republicans secure the legislative victory they desire, the entire country – with the exception, probably, of the wealthiest few – will lose.
相反，人们在制定策略时所基于的观点是，我们所有的行为都是自私的、因此最大的智识挑战是设计出“激励相容”的机制或契约，该理论也获得了诺贝尔奖的承认。	Instead, strategies have been derived from the view that all our behaviors are selfish, with the intellectual challenge being to design “incentive-compatible” mechanisms or contracts, an effort that has also been recognized with Nobel Prizes.
2000年底，互联网股票繁荣到达顶峰并且在2001年的崩溃发生之前，经济学家格拉斯曼和哈塞特发表amplt;amplt;道指36000点ampgt;ampgt;一书。	At the end of 2000, at the height of the Internet stock boom and just before the 2001 crash, the economists James Glassman and Kevin Hassett published Dow 36,000 .
但随后委内瑞拉的民主体制就连遭打击 — — 而这一过程的顶点则是上个月组建一个非法的制宪会议来重写宪法以巩固马杜罗政权的决定。	But then blow after blow was dealt to Venezuela’s democratic institutions – a process that culminated in last month’s decision to form an illegitimate constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution, so as to entrench Maduro’s regime.
也许纽约和其他许多地方要做很多事情才能防止未来的洪水，但是，正如一位前市政官员在一次采访中所说的 ， “ 不到事情发生，人们是不会愿意为它掏腰包的 。 ”	Perhaps more should be done to protect New York, among many other places, against future flooding, but, as a former city official told an interviewer: “Until things happen, people aren’t willing to pay for it.”
在最近的欧洲议会选举中，四分之一英国和法国选民支持了不赞成进一步一体化、以重建独立成员国组成的欧洲为目标的政党。	In the recent European Parliament election, a quarter of voters in the United Kingdom and France backed parties that are hostile to further integration and committed to restoring a Europe of independent member states.
比如，在相邻的津巴布韦，穆加贝暴政的结束可能重新点燃增长之火，而增长的引擎可能不再局限于自然资源，还将包括增值产品、服务和贸易。	In neighboring Zimbabwe, for example, the end of Robert Mugabe’s misrule could reignite growth linked not only to natural resources, but also to value-added products, services, and trade.
除了道义上的耻辱之外，儿童贫困在未来收入减少，犯罪率上升以及这些孩子的额外医疗保健费用方面每年估计要花掉美国5000亿美元（占GDP的近4 ％ ） 。	Beyond being a moral travesty, childhood poverty costs the US an estimated $500 billion per year (nearly 4% of GDP) in terms of forgone future earnings, higher crime rates, and increased health-care costs for these children.
此外，自2007年以来，主要国家的央行已经证明，它们可以每年将资产负债表扩大1万亿美元以上而不触发通胀。	Moreover, since 2007, major central banks have proved that they can augment their balance sheets by more than $1 trillion annually, without triggering inflation.
对特朗普而言，北美自由贸易协定真正需要的不过是一个新名称 — — 这个名称就像普拉萨德曾经指出的那样，表面上承认“美国优先 ” — —这使得他能够在支持者面前假装取得了某种积极成果。	For Trump, all NAFTA really needed was a new name – one that, as Eswar Prasad points out, literally puts “America First” – to enable him to pretend for his supporters that he achieved something positive.
这可能看起来像一个惊人的数字；但假设年经济增长率达到3 ％ ， 那么当前累计近100万亿美元的全球GDP到2050年时将达260万亿美元。	That may seem like a startlingly high figure; but, assuming 3% annual economic growth, global GDP, which stands at almost $100 trillion today, could reach $260 trillion by 2050.
与此同时，民粹主义的德国另类选择党（AfD）赢得12.6%的选票，使这个反欧元、亲俄和顽固仇外的党派成为近60年来第一个跻身德国联邦众议院的极右翼政党。	Meanwhile, the populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) won 12.6%, making this anti-euro, pro-Russia, and staunchly xenophobic party the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag in almost 60 years.
他的意图相当明确 ： “ 人们的精神总是易于弛靡，动辄贪爱着绝对的安静；我因此创造出恶魔，以激发人们的努力为能 。 ”	His intention is quite clear: “Man’s active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level; Unqualified repose he learns to crave, Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave, Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil.”
如果我们发现了延缓衰老之道，我们将面临这样的世界：大部分穷人在���亡的时候，少数富人才走过预期人生旅程的十分之一。	If we discover how to slow aging, we might have a world in which the poor majority must face death at a time when members of the rich minority are only one-tenth of the way through their expected lifespans.
无论如何，这场未遂政变已经完全证实了埃尔多安的被夺权妄想症状，也有助于解释为何针对葛兰主义者和其他政府反对派的打击力度会如此无情和广泛。	In any case, the coup attempt has fully validated Erdoğan’s paranoia, which helps explain why the crackdown on Gülenists and other government opponents has been so ruthless and extensive.
尽管采取了支持性货币政策，但已接近极限，而欧洲央行通过以极优厚的条件向商业银行贷款来刺激信用的方案并没有达到预期中的效果。	Though monetary policy is supportive, it is close to reaching its limits, and the ECB’s initiative to stimulate credit by lending to commercial banks on super-cheap terms has not proved as effective as hoped.
事实上，89岁的佩雷斯和77岁的阿巴斯（他们分别为现以色列总统和巴勒斯坦权力机构主席）尚未离世，而奥斯率协定已经随风而逝了。	In fact, the agreement is unlikely to survive 89-year-old Peres and 77-year-old Abbas, who are now presidents of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, respectively.
但受查韦斯影响（他统治委内瑞拉长达14年）的左翼民粹主义者已经对一项特别不自由的行为驾轻就熟：篡改宪法规则允许他们自己一次又一次连任。	But the left-wing populists influenced by Chávez – who ruled Venezuela for 14 years – have perfected a particularly illiberal practice: bending constitutional rules to allow themselves to be reelected again and again.
这一信条亦可谓不无道理。 25年来，人们一直说政府是个扶不起的阿斗，结果，政府真的成了扶不起的阿斗。	Again, this belief is not without justification: a quarter-century of calling the government bad has resulted in bad government.
此外，跟其他央行不同，欧洲央行的谈判对手不止一个，也没有任何一个对其负责的政府事实上或让人感觉能掌控欧元区这个整体。	Moreover, unlike its counterparts, the ECB does not face a single interlocutor, and none of the governments that hold it accountable is or feels in charge of the eurozone as a whole.
结果是失去的二十年、通缩和反省，此后，日本才终于采取了开启新的、更开放的、因而也更有活力的经济模式所必须的改革。	The result was two lost decades of deflation and introspection before Japan finally embraced the reforms needed to kick-start a new, more open – and hence more vibrant – economic model.
德国将在2017年举行大选，如今，极右翼的德国另类党（AfD）正在崛起，在最近的州选举中表现抢眼就是明证。	In Germany, which will hold a general election in 2017, support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is on the rise, exemplified in the party’s strong showing in recent state elections.
在这方面，气候变化政府间委员会的最新报告将是一个关键。 该报告提出了将升温幅度限制在1.5℃阈值内的方法。	To that end, the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report laying out pathways for keeping the temperature rise below the 1.5°C threshold will be crucial.
她所发起的项目“拯救马拉维 ” ( http : / /www.raisingmalawi.com / ) 将帮助除戴维以外的其他孤儿。	Her project, “Raising Malawi” ( www.raisingmalawi.com ), will help other orphans.
多亏紧急行动中心的设立，这些基础设施甚至通过追踪和监控接触者，协助阻止了2014年尼日利亚埃博拉疫情的爆发。	Thanks to the emergency operations centers, this infrastructure even helped to stop the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria in 2014, by enabling contact tracing and surveillance.
过去两代人时间里，随着世界人口总量翻番至73亿，每年海洋渔业捕捞增长进一步加速，从1950年的2000万吨增长至2010年的7700万吨之多。	Over the last two generations, as the world population has doubled to 7.3 billion, the amount of fish taken from the oceans each year has grown even faster, from 20 million metric tons in 1950 to 77 million in 2010.
它描述了有利于主宰性财阀形成的力量，这些财阀如此强大，只有通过世界大战和全球革命��能遏制它们 — — 即便如此，纠正仍只是暂时性的。	It portrays the forces favoring the formation of a dominant plutocracy as being so strong that they can be countered only by world wars and global revolutions – and even then, the correction is only temporary.
另外还要注意的则是巴基斯坦军方这个“超级政党 ” ， 因为巴基斯坦与印度、阿富汗以及美国这三国的关系在很大程度上是建立在军事合作之上的。	Then there is the Pakistani army, the country’s “super political party.” To a large degree, Pakistan’s relations with India, Afghanistan, and the United States depend on the military.
反过来，其债权人将同意再次进行一次性债务减记 — — 规模要大到足以让希腊在未来实际偿还债务，也要小到足以避免不必要的信用转移。	In return, its creditors would agree to another one-time debt write-off – large enough to enable Greece realistically to repay its debts in the future, but small enough to avoid unnecessary transfers of credit.
但德国相当于GDP的6%的盈余大体上是一个欧洲问题，而土耳其相当于GDP的7.4%的赤字大体上是土耳其的问题。	But Germany’s 6%-of-GDP surplus is mainly a problem for Europe, while Turkey’s 7.4% deficit is mainly a problem for Turkey.
但是尽管嘴硬显然对选民很好使，却经不起现实的检验：美国巨大的贸易赤字 — — 低储蓄的明证 — — 使经济优势这一概念颇为可疑。	But, while such tough talk undoubtedly played well with voters, it fails a key reality check: America’s large trade deficit – a visible manifestation of its low saving – calls into question the very notion of economic strength.
库尔德武装在进行了几个月的苦斗后最近终于成功地将伊斯兰国势力清除出边境小镇科巴尼（Kobane ） 。	Kurdish forces recently succeeded, after months of heavy fighting, in expelling the Islamic State from the border town of Kobane.
至少，如果我们的行动是基于某些道德原则，那么这就是我们应该做的，而不是像Leonid Brezhnev所说的：我们要守住我们拥有的一切。	At least, that is what we should do, if our actions are based on some moral principle, rather than that of Leonid Brezhnev: what we have, we hold.
卡塔尔和土耳其一样，支持草��伊斯兰运动，如穆斯林兄弟会及其在加沙、利比亚、埃及、突尼斯、伊拉克和黎凡特的分支。	Qatar, along with Turkey, backs grassroots Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots in Gaza, Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Iraq, and the Levant.
事实上，如今美国市场的交易集中在每个交易日的开盘和收盘的半小时，这时高频交易最活跃；在其他时段，市场流动性很差，没有什么交易。	Indeed, trading in the US nowadays is concentrated at the beginning and the last hour of the trading day, when HFTs are most active; for the rest of the day, markets are illiquid, with few transactions.
毕竟，1962年之战的一个教训是对中国的进犯的软弱反应无异于自掘坟墓，特别是在入侵道拉伯格玉尔地这样的局面上。	After all, one of the lessons of the 1962 war was that a vacillating response to Chinese aggression is self-defeating, particularly in situations like that posed by the incursion at Daulat Beg Oldie.
显然，我们需要一个更加合作性的战略。 我们认为，基于专利保护和执行机制的跨境技术交换框架能够释放发达和发展中经济体的创造力。	Clearly, a more cooperative strategy is needed.We believe that a framework of cross-border technological exchange based on patent protection and enforcement mechanisms can release the creativity of developed and developing economies alike.
这方面的例子包括埃塞俄比亚的风电场、改善马达加斯加森林管理、印度尼西亚和越南的全国气候规划、哥伦比亚的清洁城市交通等。	Examples include wind farms in Ethiopia, better forest management in Madagascar, nationwide climate plans in Indonesia and Vietnam, and clean urban transport in Colombia.
虽然这些机密信息和交易之间的关联难以确证 — — 正如大多数内部交易案件一样，但这些行为发生的时机却非常可疑。	While the nexus between the privileged information and the trading is difficult to prove (as it is in most insider trading cases), the timing is highly suspicious.
国际储备体系改革也应该考虑建立一个可以使各国将其当前的美元（以及欧元、日元和英镑）资产兑换成特别提款权的机制，从而避免在过渡到新体系过程中可能出现的混乱。	The reform should also allow for a mechanism for countries to exchange their current dollar (and euro, yen, and pound) assets for SDRs, thus avoiding the disruptions that could be generated by the transition to the new system.
此外，他们一直在制定详细的经济计划，该计划经过与国际社会进行充分的探讨，旨在渡过危机并实现经济恢复。	In addition, they have been working on a detailed economic plan, amply discussed with the international community, to overcome the crisis and restore growth.
更大的挑战在于创建一个指定的机构来协调多项“一带一路”计划，而在这方面只有在各国避免让政治扰乱判断的情况下才能取得成功。	The bigger challenge lies in creating a designated institution to coordinate the many OBOR initiatives. On this front, success will be possible only if countries avoid allowing politics to cloud their judgment.
在进入研究性或就业性学习计划前，准学生应该研究一下岗位占有率，了解一下学习机构如何和多频繁地与用人单位互动。	Before enrolling in an academic or vocational program, prospective students should research job-placement rates and learn how and how often the institution interacts with employers.
总体而言，非洲贸易涵盖的产品线已经较少，也就是说排除交易最多的产品将影响非洲内部贸易，从而使建立非洲大陆自贸区成为多余的举措。	On the whole, African trade already comprises relatively few product lines, which means that if the most-traded products are excluded, intra-African trade will suffer, and the entire CFTA will be rendered redundant.
平心而论，2007年以来，IMF在关于“双边监督”的决定中禁止“在外汇市场上进行大规模单方向干预 ” ， 该决定还规定“大规模、长时间”的经常项目失衡需要接受检查。	To be sure, since 2007, the IMF has prohibited “large-scale intervention in one direction in the exchange market,” in a decision on “bilateral surveillance” that also identifies “large and prolonged” current-account imbalances as a reason for review.
这一思想 — — 米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）认为它需要不可能实现的平衡 — — 说，香港可以保留其生活方式、自由和法律。	The idea – which Milton Friedman thought amounted to an impossible balancing act – was that Hong Kong would keep its way of life, liberties, and laws.
仅地中海一地就有3，200人丧生，而在紧邻孟加拉湾东侧的安达曼海，数千名移民被困在船上无法登陆，或者被人贩子扣为人质。	In the Mediterranean Sea alone, 3,200 people have perished, and in the Andaman Sea, just east of the Bay of Bengal, thousands of migrants have been stranded on boats with nowhere to land, or have been held hostage by their traffickers.
美国的官方说辞试图隐瞒美国推翻巴沙尔的举动 — — 它是违反国际法和联合国宪章的 — — 的规模和灾难性后果。	America’s official narrative has sought to conceal the scale and calamitous consequences of US efforts – in defiance of international law and the UN Charter – to overthrow Assad.
即使西方国家及其当地盟友（库尔德人、叙利亚反对派、约旦和其他逊尼派阿拉伯国家）能就由谁提供大量地面部队达成一致，伊斯兰国也已经调整了自己的战略。	Even if the West and its local allies (the Kurds, the Syrian opposition, Jordan, and other Sunni Arab countries) could agree about who would provide the bulk of ground troops, ISIS has already reshaped its strategy.
由无拨付退休金数额较大的管理者经营的银行在金融危机中的表现比同业更好，这应该是因为他们有更大的激励保证银行安全。	Banks overseen by managers who had larger unfunded pensions weathered the financial crisis better than their counterparts, presumably because they had a stronger incentive to keep them safe.
再这样的北京下，许多国家（包括亚洲和亚洲之外的国家）乐于加入中国领导的亚洲基础设施投资银行，该银行承诺满足该地区的某些融资需求。	Against this background, many countries, both inside and outside Asia, were happy to join the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which promised to meet some of the region’s financing needs.
这一偏好可以追溯到20世纪50年代的大跃进，在这场运动中，为了满足太过于乐观的钢铁产量目标，进而实现毛泽东的快速工业化梦想，炼出了大量废金属。	This predilection harkens back to the Great Leap Forward of the 1950s, when scrap metal was melted to meet wildly optimistic steel-production targets, thereby advancing Mao’s dream of rapid industrialization.
现在比任何时候都更值得记住，上一次大金融危机不仅导致了美国的新政，而且使世界陷入了一个黑暗的经济民族主义和经济帝国主义时代。	Now more than ever, it is worth remembering that the last great financial crash not only inspired the New Deal in the United States, but also plunged the world into a new dark age of economic nationalism and imperialism.
在默克尔权衡马克龙的方案的同时，她毫无疑问也要考虑德国的主要经济合作伙伴：高堡集团（Visegrád Group，V4 ） ， 即捷克、匈牙利、波兰和斯洛伐克。	While Merkel weighs Macron’s proposals, she is undoubtedly thinking of Germany’s primary economic partner: the Visegrád Group (V4), comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.
中东和北非逊尼派政治和部落宗派主义既是该地区政治制度萎靡不振的反映，也是原因，一系列失败和正在走向失败的国家沦为跨国恐怖主义的枢纽。	Political and tribal sectarianism in the Sunni Middle East and North Africa is both a reflection and a driver of the region’s weakening political institutions, with a series of failed or failing states becoming hubs of transnational terrorism.
全世界的专家们 — — 包括本周齐聚纽约参加联合国海洋会议的专家 — — 正在为各自的小目标和大目标奔波。	Experts around the world – including all of those who have gathered in New York this week for the UN Ocean Conference – are wrestling with individual targets or goals.
阿根廷今年早些时候的遭遇就体现出了这些措施的重要性，因为该国在常人眼中设计完美的方案在短短几周内就因意外技术发展而脱轨了。	The importance of such measures was highlighted earlier this year in Argentina, where a traditionally well-designed program was effectively derailed in just weeks by unanticipated technical developments.
但如果中国的干预只是暂时事件，无人预期会持续进行下去，那么第二渠道就没有操作性，其影响也将小于量化宽松。	But if Chinese intervention is just a one-off event, and there are no expectations of it continuing, then this second channel shouldn’t be operative, and the impact will be smaller than that of QE.
科学家和外行人同样倾向于赞同“优质思维”包含着准确的判断力和决策力，这也是帮助我们达成目标的思维能力。	Scientists and laypeople alike tend to agree that “good thinking” encompasses sound judgment and decision-making – the type of thinking that helps us achieve our goals.
第五条的重要性在于，如果土耳其及其盟友能够提出可信的依据证明其行动为自卫行为，那么可以不必寻求联合国安理会批准。	The significance of Article 5 is that if a credible case can be made that Turkey and its allies are acting in self-defense, they do not need to seek the UN Security Council’s approval.
. 而且，穆沙拉夫通过使用他的宪法权力来驱逐政府的任何企图都会导致另一次选举，而选举的结果和二月份的投票结果���会有很大的不同。	Moreover, any attempt by Musharraf to dislodge the government by using his constitutional authority would trigger another election, the results of which would not be much different from the vote in February.
欧元区再也无法承受周边国家持续的不确定性和高企的实际利率，因此欧洲央行必须搭建起通往未来的坚实可靠的桥梁。	The eurozone can no longer sustain continued uncertainty and high real interest rates in the peripheral countries, so the ECB must provide a solid and credible bridge to the future.
比如，提振公共投资回报 — — 对任何增长计划，这一点都是关键 — — 需要相辅相成的政策和条件，从资源配置到制度环境在内的诸多领域都是如此。	For example, boosting returns on public investment – critical to any growth plan – demands complementary policies and conditions, in areas ranging from resource allocation to the institutional environment.
成立于二战后，为保持稳定而设的布雷顿森林组织有可能失去它们的影响力，而有能力增强它们的影响力的国家现阶段又不愿意果断推进必要的改革。	The Bretton Woods organizations, instituted after World War II to maintain stability, risk losing their influence, and the countries with the clout to bolster them seem unwilling at this stage to press ahead boldly with the needed reforms.
直到2006年这部法律的修订版面世，这在中国致力于建立一个有效的法律体系，从而向市场经济迈进的过程中具有历程碑的意义。	So, in 2006, a revised version of the law was enacted, marking an important milestone in China’s efforts to build an effective legal system as it moves towards a market economy.
而且，信息产业的跨国联系十分紧密，西方国家高科技公司越来越多地雇用在班加罗尔和上海的附属单位来提供即时服务。	Moreover, transnational connections in the information industry are close, as Western high-tech companies increasingly employ affiliates in Bangalore and Shanghai to provide real-time services.
但即便他们尽可能避免重蹈覆辙的意愿令人赞叹，德国的立法者们却通过了这样一项法案，把可以避免某些人类悲剧的现代科技手段定义为有罪。	But, in their laudable desire to distance themselves as much as possible from those atrocities, Germany’s legislators have enacted a law that makes it a crime to use modern science to avoid undoubted human tragedies.
随着她们投入到工作当中，她们的语言能力得到提高，家庭收入增加，而她们的孩子则亲眼看到了一个有尊严，有经济能力的女性。	As they enter the workforce, their language skills improve, their household income soars, and their children see firsthand a woman in a respected, economically valued role.
如果我们不能在我们这个物种曾经进化的非洲大陆作为狩猎和采集者生存下去，那么人类相对于其他动物究竟如何取得如此巨大的成功并扩展到地球几乎所有的主要生态系统？	If we cannot survive as hunter-gatherers in Africa, the continent where our species evolved, how did humans achieve such immense success relative to other animals and spread to nearly all of the earth’s major ecosystems?
这个卡特诉加拿大（Carter v. Canada）的案子也足以在协助死亡的事实，法律和道德方面被写入教科书。	The case, Carter v. Canada, could serve as a textbook on the facts, law, and ethics of assistance in dying.
事实上，今年韩国饱受灾难困扰，一开始是4月的岁月号（Sewol）客轮沉没，导致300人死亡，其中大部分是高中生。	Indeed, disaster has stalked South Korea this year, beginning in April with the sinking of the ferry Sewol, which claimed some 300 lives, most of them high school students.
债务集中机制还必须解决一个事实 — — 当最坚挺国家与信誉较低国家政府捆绑在一起共同负责债务时，它们难免会面临其自身债务利率升高的局面。	A debt-pooling scheme must also address the fact that the strongest countries will inevitably face higher interest rates on their own debts when they become jointly liable for the debts of less credit-worthy governments.
更多地受利益和市场份额而不是慈善的驱动，华为公司通过更低的价格、更快的行动以及更愿意在艰苦的环境中工作而超越了美国和欧洲的竞争对手。	Motivated by profit and market share rather than philanthropy, Huawei is outpacing American and European rivals through lower prices, faster action, and a greater willingness to work in difficult environments.
世界上绝大多数的城区在过去几十年间都经历了远比因为全球变暖而导致未来百年间气温预计将提高2.6℃的幅度高出很多的气温的上升。	Most of the world’s urban areas have already experienced far more dramatic temperature hikes over the past few decades than the 2.6°C increase expected from global warming over the next hundred years.
我们知道，2012年（或者更早）美国总统奥巴马授权中央情报局与美国盟友合作，为由心存不满的叙利亚人和非叙利亚军人组成的叛军提供支持。	We know that in 2012, if not earlier, President Barack Obama authorized the CIA to work with America’s allies in providing support to rebel forces composed of disaffected Syrians as well as non-Syrian fighters.
哥德堡—2014年，世界卫生组织报告，耐药性 — — 特别是抗生素耐药性 — — 正在日益成为人类健康、食品安全和“现代医学成就”的威胁。	GOTHENBURG – In 2014, the World Health Organization reported that drug resistance – especially resistance to antibiotics – is a growing threat to human health, food security, and “the achievements of modern medicine.”
我们也不能低估这对于欧洲央行应对低增长和低通胀的可信承诺所触发的“动物精神 ” （ 消费者、商业和投资者信心）的影响。	One should also not discount the effect on “animal spirits” – consumer, business, and investor confidence – that a credible commitment by the ECB to deal with slow growth and low inflation may trigger.
在一阵手足无措后，单身母亲被当作美国核心价值观的末日先兆扔进了垃圾桶（当时的单身父亲却没有经历同样的厄运 ） 。	Much hand-wringing followed, with single mothers (never, at that time, single fathers) cast as harbingers of doom for core American values.
纽约 — — 美国大选总能创造出一种短暂的欣快情绪，一种公众新鲜感、一种对未来机会的期盼，作用有点类似于注射肾上腺素。	NEW YORK – American elections usually produce a brief euphoria; the public sense of renewal, of future possibilities, acts as a shot of adrenaline.
这样一个美式和平可以让美国以较少的代价予以维持，但是如果美国像在伊拉克问题上采取错误的政策，那么整个世界都会担忧。	Such a Pax Americana would cost the country less to sustain, but the world would worry if America adopts a wrong policy, as has been the case in Iraq.
但支持收紧货币政策的民粹主义观点亦然 — — 在美国，唐纳德·特朗普步泰德·科鲁兹（Ted Cruz）和其他共和党领导人后尘，支持回归金本位。	But so are populist arguments for tightening monetary policy – in the US, Donald Trump, following Ted Cruz and other Republican leaders, has advocated a return to the gold standard.
2005年5月大部分法国人在全民公决中否决欧盟宪法草案的原因可能致使他们把票投给在所有候选人中最为亲欧洲的贝鲁。	The very reason that led a majority of the French to say “no” to the referendum on the European Union’s draft Constitutional Treaty in May 2005 may lead them to vote for Bayrou, the most pro-European of all candidates.
也门军队可以说毫无作为，在胡塞叛军兵临首都时仍然呆在军营里，也没有迹象表明与美国人合作的单位会忠于新的叛军政府。	Yemen's military is largely intact, having remained in its barracks as the Houthis marched to the capital, and there is little evidence that the units that work with the Americans are loyal to the new rebel government.
否则的话，就不得不进入代价昂贵的收回抵押品赎回权程序，这将使借款人和贷款人都受损，从这个角度看，波斯纳和津加莱斯的方案应该能够获得借款人和贷款人双方的支持。	To the extent that the alternative is costly foreclosure proceedings that make borrowers and lenders worse off, this proposal should attract the support of both sides.
2016年世界银行分析显示，非洲及中东地区与干旱相关的水资源危机可能会使这些地区的国内生产总值到2050年下降达6 % 。	According to a 2016 World Bank analysis, drought-related water crises in Africa and the Middle East could reduce GDP in these regions by as much as 6% by 2050.
虽说为实现谈判目标，东盟作为由邻国构成的组织所起的作用至关重要，但美国的参与才是问题的关键所在，此外也少不了中国和印度。	ASEAN, as the organization of neighboring states, is important to achieving that goal, but US involvement is key, as is inclusion of China and India.
我们打造不断扩大的分子数据海洋的能力在日渐成长，当前数据容量已经达到了ZB级别（即1后面跟21个0 ） ， 随之而来的问题是如何储存和破译这些信息。	With our ability to generate ever-rising oceans of molecular data – now approaching the zetabyte scale (that’s a one followed by 21 zeros) – comes the challenge of storing and deciphering this information.
不同的国家的数百名科学家以撰稿者或评论者的身份参与了这些报告的撰写，这或许是历史上对科学问题进行国际评估的最全面和最彻底的一次。	Many hundreds of scientists from different countries were involved as contributors and reviewers for these reports, which are probably the most comprehensive and thorough international assessments on any scientific subject ever carried out.
我们制定的该宣言把平等视为一种“独立的权利 ” ， 也就是说，它最为一种独立存在的权利，它并不依赖于对某一种法定权利，如受教育权，的侵犯。	The declaration that we have developed regards equality as a “freestanding right.” In other words, it exists as a separate right, and is not dependent on the violation of some other legal right, such as the right to education.
印刷机的发明使科技革命成为可能，蒸气机的发明为工业革命创造了条件，而印度摆脱饥荒则主要依靠提高农业产出¾也就是所谓的“绿色革命 ” 。	The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press, the industrial revolution by the steam engine, and India’s escape from famine by increased farm yields – the so-called “Green Revolution.”
那些想要模仿美国生产效率趋势的人们必须了解他们对巨型零售点遍布乡间、压低工资以及摧垮小规模零售商的感觉。	Those who would aim to emulate US productivity trends must come to grips with how they feel about big-box stores sprouting across their countryside’s, driving down wages and plowing under smaller-scale retailers.
第二项原则 — — 编辑“不应产生或加剧社会分歧，或让社会中的某些群体边缘化或弱势化 ” — —平心而论确实将争论范围扩大到了个体父母的选择之外。	The second principle – that editing “should not produce or exacerbate social division, or marginalize or disadvantage groups in society” – does, in fairness, move the debate beyond the choice of individual parents.
委员会集合了相关重要部门的部长，起到了协调和加快决策的作用，最初的几次会议就批准了数百亿美元的支出项目。	By bringing together the key ministers, the committee has coordinated and accelerated decision-making, and has already approved tens of billions of dollars in spending in its first few meetings.
随着建筑公司和其他政府合同的受益者开始向执政的自民党大笔捐款，这项政策催生了新的既得利益团体，也因此改变了政治环境。	This policy created new vested interests, and thus a new political environment, as construction companies and other beneficiaries of government contracts began donating heavily to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
肯尼亚官员显然非常担心，因为国际货币基金组织已经将其列入债务监管名单，而且几乎肯定会要求实行进一步的紧缩政策。	Kenyan officials are clearly worried, as the IMF has already put Kenya on its debt watch list and will almost certainly demand further belt-tightening.
当然 ， “ 人民轴心”也不会将美国人排除在外：美国商界和非营利组织的活力，创造性和资源已经遍布全球。	Here, the pivot to the people includes the American people: the dynamism, creativity, and resources of American business and non-profit organizations already engaged around the world.
为了防止产生这样的结果，阿拉伯国家必须迅速行动起来构建更加可持续的经济，其基础是更大的私人部门创造力和活力、改善的公共服务，以及创造地区和全球公共品。	To prevent such an outcome, Arab countries must move fast to build a more sustainable economy, underpinned by greater private-sector creativity and vitality, improved public services, and the creation of regional and global public goods.
C则是联盟（coalition ） ： 艾滋病运动很快就认识到，只有获得了多样化的支持，才能取得进步。	“C” is for coalitions: the AIDS movement was quick to understand that progress would come only with diverse support.
他们向耶鲁大学心理学家卡尔·霍夫兰及其同事寻求帮助，前者的研究结果成就了由沟通者、受众和信息等三组变量组成的著名的说服模型。	They sought help from Yale University psychologist Carl Hovland and his associates, who produced what has become a well-known model of persuasion, comprising three groups of variables related to the communicator, the audience, and the message.
罗蒙诺索夫海岭的性质还将有多年的争论，而他 — — 以及我们 — — 的思维也许更专注于更紧迫的问题。	The nature of the Lomonosov Ridge will be debated for years to come, while his thoughts – and ours – are likely to be focused on more immediate issues.
卡加梅因此建议给各国家都订立一个年人均二氧化碳排放额，并允许那些排放低于限额的国家将排放量出售给那些超出限额的国家。	Kagame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions, and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above theirs.
而奥巴马也是在对他的前任小布什拨乱反正。 小布什总是危险地把触手伸得过长，其掀起的全球反恐战争就是明证。	Obama, for his part, was reacting to his own predecessor, George W. Bush, whose tendency toward dangerous overreach was exemplified in his Global War on Terror.
如果美国想要像特朗普承诺的那样变得伟大，就需要建立更多面向未来的工业，可以在全球范围内展开竞争 — — 并为美国工人提供就业机会。	If America is to be great, as Trump has promised, it needs to build more future-oriented industries that can compete globally – and that can provide jobs to American workers.
通过设立禁飞区 — — 可以用海基导弹系统进行防卫 — — 美国及其伙伴国可以向巴沙尔证明，它们的耐心终究是有限度的，它们已经准备好在叙利亚境内保护叙利亚人。	By establishing a no-fly zone – which could be defended using sea-based missile systems – the US and its partners would demonstrate to Assad that their patience has finally run out, and that they are prepared to defend Syrians within Syria.
实际上，即使罗曼·阿布拉莫维奇（俄罗斯石油大亨 ） （ 在西伯利亚的）的Sibneft石油公司¾这个因为寡头垄断以及实施与毁掉尤科斯集团相同的偷税阴谋而最易受到攻击的公司，需要对付的麻烦也仅仅是初步的清偿税款。	As it is, even Roman Abramovich’s Sibneft – potentially the most vulnerable company due to its oligarch ownership and its use of the same tax minimization schemes that were the undoing of Yukos – merely faces a preliminary claim for back taxes.
但是目前，伊朗和自称的由德国、英国和法国组成的三方(美国不时地提供支持)相互猜忌，这对于有效的谈判并非吉祥。	But the current climate of mutual wariness between Iran and the self-proclaimed triad of Germany, Great Britain, and France (with sporadic US support) is not propitious to effective negotiations.
根据���际货币基金组织（IMF）的数据，2002—2007年，乌克兰和俄罗斯都经历了卓越的经济增长：在这五年中，真实人均GDP在乌克兰增长了52 % ， 在俄罗斯增长了 46 % 。	According to the International Monetary Fund, both Ukraine and Russia experienced spectacular growth from 2002 to 2007: over those five years, real per capita GDP rose 52% in Ukraine and 46% in Russia.
在一系列和传统方法在有些地方如此不同的观点包围中，斯宾塞已经取得达成共识的程度，是一个了不起的壮举。	It is quite a feat to have achieved the degree of consensus he has around a set of ideas that departs in places so markedly from the traditional approach.
首相大卫·卡梅伦令人大跌眼镜，在下议院赢得绝对多数，成功实现连任，现在，他必须利用增加的权力制定一套可以吸引所有成员国的欧盟改革方案。	Reelected with a resounding – and entirely unexpected – majority in the House of Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron must now use his increased mandate to set out an EU reform package that is attractive to all member states.
（特朗普唯独不想与共和党被普遍嘲笑的新医疗提案有关，这份提案正在取代标志奥巴马成就的平价医疗法案。 ）	(The one thing on which Trump does not want his name is the Republicans’ widely derided new health-care proposal, intended to replace Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act.)
每千瓦时电力二氧化碳排放量，天然气只有煤炭的二分之一弱，而氮氧化物、二氧化硫、炭黑、一氧化碳、汞和微粒粉尘的排放量，天然气更是少得多。	Gas emits less than half the CO2 per kWh produced, and it emits much lower amounts of other pollutants like NOx, SO2, black carbon, CO, mercury, and particulates.
反对对救助汽车业的势力正在重弹保守经济思想的最糟粕的一部分，正是这些思维，才使得美国和世界最初陷入了这个烂摊子。	Opposition to the bailout is bringing back to the surface the worst of the conservative economic thought that got America and the world into this mess in the first place.
每个阵营在两位可怕的女领袖的领导下轮流控制过政府：现任总理、人民联盟（Awami League）的谢赫·哈西娜·瓦吉德（Sheikh Hasina Wazed）以及在她之前连任两届的孟加拉国民党（Bangladesh Nationalist Party）的比格姆·卡勒达·齐亚（Begum Khaleda Zia ） 。	Each camp has taken its turn controlling the government, under two formidable female leaders: the Awami League’s Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the current prime minister, and her two-term predecessor, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s Begum Khaleda Zia.
相比之下，让-雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）认为人性是可塑的，但我们在原始状态下不存在理性，语言或社群。	By contrast, Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed that human nature is malleable, but that our original state was one without reason, language, or community.
（1）饮食失调：如果你在连续三个月内每周过量进食一次，进食时缺乏自我控制能力，进食过后感觉过饱，并有沮丧，尴尬和厌恶感，那么就可以诊断为饮食失调。	(1) Binge eating disorder. If you overeat once a week for three months, lacking self-control and experiencing over-fullness afterward, and are distressed, embarrassed, and disgusted with yourself, you are diagnosable.
全球每消费九桶石油中就有一桶产自沙特阿拉伯，该国不仅在全球经济中非常关键；其政府稳定对国际秩序而言同样是不可或缺的。	Saudi Arabia, the source of one in nine barrels of oil consumed globally, is not just a linchpin of the global economy; its government’s stability is crucial to the international order.
议会 — — 代议制机构 — — 对预算进行投票，这保证了作为一个整体的人民需要为其政府产生的债务承担责任。	Voting budgets in parliament – a representative institution – ensured that the people as a whole were liable for the obligations incurred by their government.
在这方面，比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会（Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation）所支持的研究已经帮助开发出了无毒高产的木薯。	To this end, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has supported research leading to the development of nontoxic, high-yield varieties of cassava.
在慕尼黑，自雇的瓦盖工人从2004年的119人增加到2005年的970人，这正好是首批欧盟东扩的头两年。	In Munich, the number of self-employed tilers increased in 2004 and 2005, the first two years after the first eastern enlargement wave, from 119 to 970.
记者兼诗人南迪（Pritish Nandy）在这篇文章中接受采访评论说，就连他的Twitter的粉丝都比总理辛格多（后者当时大约只有195000粉丝 ） 。	The journalist and poet Pritish Nandy, interviewed in the Times article, remarked that even he had more Twitter followers than Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (who had only around 195,000 at the time).
而自从那一幕幕最终定格在美军直升机于废弃的西贡美国大使馆上空盘旋的经典画面之后，越南也淡出了人们的视线之外，被遗忘了。	But ever since those immortal scenes of US army helicopters hovering above the abandoned US embassy in Saigon in 1975, Vietnam has mostly slipped from the world’s consciousness.
同样，这种变化源自于那些重负债危机国家的政府债券被下调了评级，使他们在国际交易中变得缺乏吸引力，以及其他国家流动性供应源的弹性缺乏。	This change is due, equally, to downgrades in the ratings of heavily indebted crisis countries’ government bonds, which make them unattractive for use in international transactions, and the inelasticity of other sources of supply.
同样，尽管福克斯由于对抗议者和破坏性的极端反对力量姑息迁就而饱受批评，但他从未进行过令那些嗜血的前任闻名遐尔的血腥镇压。	Likewise, while Fox can be criticized for not clamping down on protesters and a disruptive, extremist opposition, he never resorted to the bloody repression for which most of his predecessors came to be known.
而普京这位亚努克维奇背后的傀儡操纵者为了将乌克兰圈在俄罗斯的势力范围内，还假惺惺地批评外国势力导致乌克兰的政治危机	Putin, who played the role of puppeteer in Yanukovych’s decision to keep his country within the Russian orbit, hypocritically blames external forces for Ukraine’s political crisis.
在最新的《世界经济展望》中，IMF预测2012年全球GDP增长将仅为3.3 % ， 2013年为3.6 % 。	In its most recent WEO, the IMF forecasts global GDP to grow by only 3.3% in 2012, and by 3.6% in 2013.
即使是欧洲最大的经济体德国也经历了2010年以来最大规模的房地产热潮，城市住宅平均价格上升了超过1/3 — — 大城市则升了将近一半。	Even Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has been experiencing a massive property boom since 2010, with average urban property prices having risen by more than one-third – and by nearly half in large cities.
在被问道他们认为自己“首先是伊拉克人”或“首先是穆斯林”时，2006年的调查发现28%的伊拉克人认同自己“首先是伊拉克人 ” ， 比2004年时的23%有所上升。	Asked whether they considered themselves “Iraqis, above all” or “Muslims, above all,” the 2006 survey found that 28% of Iraqis identified themselves as “Iraqis, above all,” up from 23% in 2004.
根据渔业安全组织的报告，现在就取缔IUU捕捞能让索马里开始发放许可并可持续地出售经济价值极高的金枪鱼，每年可获得170亿美元收入。	According to the Secure Fisheries’ report, eliminating IUU fishing today would enable Somalia to begin to license and sell commercially valuable tuna sustainably, generating up to $17 million per year.
不管最后的事实如何，这位巴西-黎巴嫩-法国混血执行官的职业生涯 — — 其中他执掌日产18年，执掌雷诺13年 — — 也将戛然而止。	Whatever facts eventually emerge, the Brazilian-Lebanese-French executive’s career, which included 18 years running Nissan and 13 years running Renault, has come to an abrupt end.
欧盟统计机构欧洲统计局计算年轻人失业率时同时使用这两个指标，但尽管这两者存在明显差异，被广泛报道的只有存在缺陷的前者。	Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, calculates youth unemployment using both methodologies, but only the flawed indicator is widely reported, despite major discrepancies.
在这些投资者-国家纠纷和解（ISDS）机制中，外国投资者获得了新的起诉国家政府的权利，对于它们认为降低了它们的投资的预期盈利能力的监管采取私人仲裁。	Under these investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) systems, foreign investors gain new rights to sue national governments in binding private arbitration for regulations they see as diminishing the expected profitability of their investments.
映入游客眼帘的是阿纳托区的辉煌建筑，还可以了解巴勒斯坦历史最悠久的仍在运营的学校，创办于1598年的Terra Sancta大学。	Visitors encountered the splendid architecture of the Anatra quarter, and learned about Palestine’s oldest still-functioning school, the Terra Sancta College, which dates back to 1598.
作为接受方，工业化国家的政府们所顾虑的是新的主权财富基金(SWF)正被战略性地使用，而并非只是遵循市场逻辑。	On the receiving end, industrial countries’ governments are anxious that new sovereign wealth funds (SWF’s) are being used strategically, rather than simply following the logic of the market.
事实上，在普京干预乌克兰统统选举的第一周，他就曾威胁要对他们进行封锁，因为乔治亚的阿布哈兹地区居然胆敢去投一个克里姆林宫不喜欢的总统候选人的票。	Indeed, in the very week that Putin was meddling in Ukraine’s presidential election, he was threatening to blockade one of those statelets, Georgia’s Abkhazia region, after it had the temerity to vote for a president the Kremlin did not like.
20世纪70年代曾完全依赖于能源进口的丹麦现在成了欧盟唯一一个能源净出口国，风力发电满足了该国100%的电力需求。	Denmark, a country that in the 1970s was almost entirely dependent on energy imports, is now the European Union’s only net energy exporter, often generating more than 100% of its electricity needs from wind power.
当施罗德总理来到莫斯科红场参加庆祝仪式的时候，他应该反思的是德国要为波罗的海诸国的悲剧承担多少责任。	When Chancellor Schröder travels to Moscow for the Red Square celebrations, he should bear in mind Nazi Germany’s contribution to the Baltic tragedy.
邓利用了人们这种厌恶革命的情绪，限制了政治和国家在人们私生活中所发挥的作用，释放了人们压抑已久的能量，鼓励他们追求自己的目标。	Deng capitalized on this revolution-weariness by diminishing the role of politics and the state in people’s private lives and freeing them to release their pent-up energy to pursue their own goals.
但这里的内部装饰有一点与众不同ľ一面嵌着窗户的人造墙把餐馆的厅堂分成了两半，墙后面布置成了一个乡村庭院。	But the interior decoration had one unique element – an artificial wall with windows separating a part of the restaurant hall. Behind the wall was a stage set of a village yard.
其他人则认为，西方民主存在相反的问题：狭隘、政治一根筋的利益太大，导致投资不足以及当前和未来机会和表现权衡失策。	Others argue that Western democracies have the opposite problem: a surfeit of narrow, politically assertive interests leads to underinvestment and poor tradeoffs between present and future opportunities and performance.
能增加资金固然最好，但妄想发展援助资金能一夜之间翻倍，或宏大得不切实际的联合国发展议程具备稳步推进所需要的资源是相当愚蠢得。	It will be great if we can increase funding, but it would be foolish to think that development-aid money will multiply overnight, or that the UN’s massive, quixotic development agenda has the resources to remain on track.
就像多数发展中国家那样，当投资环境被认为不确定时，投资者会对几乎任何项目要求风险溢价，就连潜在回报率很高的项目也无法幸免。	When the investment environment is considered uncertain, as is the case in most developing countries, investors demand a risk premium on virtually any project, even those with potentially high rates of return.
这一点很重要，因为新亚洲秩序与其说将由东亚发展趋势决定，不如说将由印度洋所发生的事件决定。 在东亚，日本必然会阻挠中国的崛起，而在印度洋，中国正在挑战目前的印度主导地位。	This is important, because the new Asian order will be determined less by developments in East Asia, where Japan is determined to block China's rise, than by events in the Indian Ocean, where China is chipping away at India's longstanding dominance.
国际货币政策的标准三元悖论认为，一国不可能同时满足固定汇率、货币独力和自由资本流动，但它们可以实现其中两者。	The standard trilemma of international monetary policy holds that countries cannot have fixed exchange rates, monetary independence, and free capital movement simultaneously, but they can have two of the three.
美国的联邦基金利率实际为零，而欧洲央行的主要再贷款利率虽然一直以来已经低到2 % ， 还是可能在以后的几个月中降得更低。	The Federal funds rate in the US is practically zero, and the European Central Bank’s main refinancing rate, already at an all-time low of 2%, will likely fall further in the coming months.
他在结束陈词中扔下一枚重磅炸弹：称曾是他手下警察局长兼左膀右臂（而且没有“做人的基本道德 ” ） 的王立军暗恋他的妻子。	In his closing statement, he dropped a bombshell: he claimed that Wang Lijun, his former police chief and henchman (and a “vile character”), was secretly in love with his wife.
所有现代经济体的政策制定及执行者都对金融市场的剧烈短期价格波动和实体经济更具渐进性的长期结构调整之间的矛盾感到焦头烂额。	All modern economies struggle with the inconsistency between sharp and volatile short-term price movements in financial markets and more gradual long-term structural adjustments in the real economy.
尽管现在重新谈判协议在政治上不现实，但需要对必要的财政调整进行严格分析，���一分析可以让独立专家审核。	Though it is politically unrealistic to renegotiate the deal at this point, a serious analysis of the necessary fiscal adjustment, possibly arbitrated by independent experts, is needed.
父母亲急切地希望孩子能获得社会优势，以至于可能凭借错误或不完全遗传信息做出生殖决定，或是在尚未做足安全测试的情况下后代的基因突变。	Eager to give their children social advantages, parents may make reproductive decisions based on faulty or incomplete genetic information, or seek genetic alteration of their offspring before adequate safety testing has been carried out.
因为你们自身的理由与我们的斗争无关，你们鼓励哈马斯极端主义，并因此引发了以色列的暴力反应，加重了我们的苦难，导致我们都热切盼望的解决方案一再推迟。	For your own reasons that have nothing to do with our struggle, you encourage the extremism of Hamas, thus provoking Israel’s violent reaction, aggravating our suffering, and pushing back the solution that we all want.
西方穆斯林崛起的一代的体验究竟是什么，从而导致一小撮人把暴力视为其经济和政治困境的解决之道、而自杀是它们的报偿和拯救呢？	What is it about the experience of the West’s rising generation of Muslims that leads a small minority to see violence as a solution to their economic and political dilemmas, and suicide as their reward and salvation?
一种更佳解决办法是成立一个新的独立财政机构，为个体成员国设置借贷目标，然后与一个欧洲债务机构共同代表它们发行（不超过某个限额的）欧元债。	A better solution would be to create a new, independent fiscal body to establish borrowing targets for individual member states, together with a European debt agency to issue eurobonds (up to a certain level) on their behalf.
他的两本近著分别起名为《死于中国 》 （ Death by China，2011年）和《卧虎：中国军国主义对世界意味着什么 》 （ Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World，2015年 ） ， 里面充斥着地摊文学水平的偏见。	The titles of his two most recent books – Death by China (2011) and Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World (2015) – speak volumes about his tabloid-level biases.
消灭脊髓灰质炎期间建立的卫生基础设施协助部署注射脊髓灰质炎疫苗，以便补充口服疫苗确保病毒不会卷土重来。	The health infrastructure put in place during the eradication campaign has enabled the deployment of injectable polio vaccines, which will complement the oral vaccines in ensuring that the virus does not return.
但在过去十年经历了这么多冲击和技术变革之后，人们很难确定尚未使用的力量究竟有多少，以及不加速通胀的就业率(NAIRU) 在什么地方。	But after so many shocks and so much technological change over the last decade, there is considerable uncertainty about how much unused capacity remains and where the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) lies.
不幸的是，现在的欧洲如此四分五裂，以此为核心的全新举措面临“越来越大的政治阻力 ” ， 以至于外界并不看好欧洲实现这一目标的能力。	Unfortunately, Europe is so divided nowadays that the ability to achieve such an outcome is not promising, with new initiatives along these lines facing “increasing political resistance.”
没错，美国对中国存在着巨大的贸易逆差 — — 2011年约为2950亿美元，相当于美国7380亿美元商品贸易总缺口的40 % 。	Yes, the US runs a massive trade deficit with China – around $295 billion in 2011, or fully 40% of America’s total merchandise trade gap of $738 billion.
总体而言，身份证号计划对参与者的损害远大于个人信息被错误分享给剑桥分析政治咨询公司的8，700万脸书用户。	Overall, the Aadhaar program leaves participants far more compromised than even, say, the 87 million Facebook users whose personal data were wrongly shared with the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.
他认为 ， （ 比如）原子弹应该被视为“固有政治产物 ” ， 因为它的“致命属性要求它由集中化的刚性命令层级链来控制 。 ”	He thought that the atom bomb, for example, should be considered an “inherently political artifact,” because its “lethal properties demand that it be controlled by a centralized, rigidly hierarchical chain of command.”
其次，国会预算办公室估计该立法将在未来十年增加1.45万亿美元的赤字，这可能会导致老年医疗保健（Medicare）和医疗补助（Medicaid）等面向老年人，穷人和残疾人医疗保险项目的开支遭到削减。	Second, the CBO estimates that the law will add $1.45 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, which could trigger spending cuts to health-insurance programs for the elderly, poor, and disabled, such as Medicare and Medicaid.
这令人奇怪地想起了《创世纪 》 ： 六天的紧张工作，一天的休息 — — 休息在这里指的是签署停火协议。	It was oddly reminiscent of Genesis: six days of intense effort followed by a day of rest, in this case the signing of a cease-fire.
这种自下而上“全球化”各国政府的举措拥有影响环境政策的巨大潜力，尤其是那些针对减缓气候变化 — — 这是当前最棘手的全球问题 — — 的政策。	Such bottom-up efforts to “globalize” national governments have the greatest potential to affect environmental policies, particularly those aimed at mitigating climate change – the most intractable global problem of all.
全球崩溃的风险很小，因为大部分发达经济体都在迅速去杠杆化；财政拖累的影响较小；货币政策仍然有利；资产再通胀也造成了积极的财富效应。	The risk of a global crash has been low, because deleveraging has proceeded apace in most advanced economies; the effects of fiscal drag are smaller; monetary policies remain accommodative; and asset reflation has had positive wealth effects.
首先，为预防核转移起见，我们必须对出入目标国的所有陆地、海洋和空中航线加以控制，并着力强化远近国土安全措施。	First, in order to prevent nuclear migration, all land, sea, and air routes out of the country in question would have to be controlled, and homeland security near and far would have to be strengthened.
埃尔多安的算盘是就新的更自由的宪法达成一致，新宪法将强化土耳其第一大少数民族的权利，将大量权力移交给地区政府。	The hope is to agree on a new, more liberal constitution that will strengthen the rights of Turkey’s largest ethnic minority and include substantial devolution of power to regional governments.
从法国—北约关系的历史上看，许多类似的举措要么不了了之、要么马失前蹄。 最近的一次失败是希拉克在1995年上台以后企图修补法国与北约关系的努力。	Historically, aborted moves and faux pas abound on both sides in the French/NATO relationship, the latest being Jacques Chirac’s failed attempt to patch up France’s relations with NATO upon his arrival in power in 1995.
尽管警示之言如此之多，但是还是有些真相不让他们高兴。 那就是，在过去两年的时间里，全球海平面没有上升，而是轻微下降了。	Given all the warnings, here is a slightly inconvenient truth: over the past two years, the global sea level hasn’t increased.
但如果这样的话，他们就破坏了汇率管制的第一条法则：切不能一段段地砍猫尾巴（意即措施必须一步到位 ） 。	But, in that case, they violated the first rule of exchange-rate management: Don’t cut off a cat’s tail in slices.
第一本书是《变化和冲击 》 （ The Shifts and the Shocks ） ， 作者是保守派英国记者马丁·沃尔夫（Martin Wolf ） 。 在书的开头，他对酝酿了至今仍在影响世界的这场经济灾难的重要变化做了归纳编目。	The first book is The Shifts and the Shocks, by the conservative British journalist Martin Wolf, who begins by cataloguing the major shifts that set the stage for the economic disaster that continues to shape the world today.
但劳工骚乱和维持10%增长率的意愿意味着中国应该带头解决朝鲜半岛和平问题并遏制任何有损经济发展的政治因素。	But labor unrest and the desire to maintain 10% growth suggest that China should be taking the lead in ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula and preventing other political developments from derailing its economy.
尽管美联储试图忽略过去商品价格的短暂波动，也将难以忽视一旦过去一年价格大幅下降态势 — — 尤其是能源价格 — — 出现停止甚至逆转所导致的消费通胀。	While the Fed tries to look past transitory fluctuations in commodity prices, it will be hard to ignore rising consumer inflation as the huge drop of the past year – particularly in energy prices – stabilizes or even reverses.
总统奥巴马任命了“就业沙皇 ” ， 这也有助于提振信誉、加强可问责性以及强化克服当今重大且不断恶化的就业挑战所必须的协调。	President Barack Obama’s appointment of a “jobs czar” would also help to enhance the credibility, accountability, and coordination required to overcome today’s significant and rising employment challenges.
“富”者，老式新教徒富豪也，他们丧失了保护自己的财富的能力，自然会被“人不为己天诛地灭”的精于街头智慧的后起之秀 — — 主要是犹太人讹诈。	The rich were the old-money Protestant establishment whose members had lost their skills for protecting their wealth, which was therefore rightfully forfeited to street-savvy up-and-comers – mainly Jewish – amoral enough to help themselves to it.
过多的短期行为来自金融市场的可能性和来自行政系统的可能性一样大，尤其是公司首席执行官级别，美国企业的这类职位通常有6~7年的任期。	Excessive short-termism can come from the executive suite as much as from financial markets, especially from CEOs, who in the US have an average tenure of 6-7 years.
英国不应该像目前所做的那样对它的计划保密，也显然不应该采取边缘政策 — — 比如梅的“没有协议也比坏协议好”的战斗宣言。	It should not keep its plans secret, as it has so far done, and it certainly should not engage in brinkmanship, such as that exemplified by May’s battle cry that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”
去年9月，在哈萨克斯坦巴扎尔巴耶夫大学（Nazarbayev University）的演讲中，习近平提出了所谓的“丝绸之路经济带 ” ， 这是一项旨在增进欧亚地区国际合作和联合开发的新外交政策。	In September of last year, in a speech at Kazakhstan’s Nazarbayev University, Xi announced the so-called “Silk Road Economic Belt,” a new foreign-policy initiative aimed at boosting international cooperation and joint development throughout Eurasia.
例如，尽管各国间有着前所未有的依存关系，多边主义却越来越被边缘化，许多国家 — — 尤其是特朗普总统治理下的美国 — — 正在追求单边的孤立主义道路上渐行渐远。	For example, despite the world’s unprecedented interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being eschewed, as countries – most notably, Donald Trump’s US – pursue unilateral, isolationist policies.
与此同时，国际社会应该支持能源节约和储存方面的研究，并且加快发展第四代核反应堆，后者采用的是核裂变，既干净又耐久。	At the same time, the international community should support research on energy saving and storage, and accelerate the development of fourth-generation nuclear reactors, which will use fission and be both clean and durable.
提高利率可以降低总体需求，这样可以减缓经济并且限制某些商品与服务价格���上升，特别是并不交易的商品和服务。	Raising interest rates can reduce aggregate demand, which can slow the economy and tame increases in prices of some goods and services, especially non-traded goods and services.
对于他们而言，即便欧盟的各民族并没有形成对欧洲的强烈归属感，民族身份也应该被摒弃从而有利于欧洲身份的确立。	For them, national identity should be abandoned in favor of a European identity, even if the feeling of belonging to Europe is not deeply held among the peoples of the EU.
如果答案是肯定的，扩大欧元区成员国范围真的有助于欧洲达到最大化经济一体化而又不必形成政治上的完全统一这一众人皆知的目标吗？	If so, does enlarging the euro’s membership really serve Europe’s apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union?
从一位德国人和勿庸置疑的大西洋主义者口中说出这句话或许颇具讽刺意味，但其实却恰如其分，因为德国在从凶残的专制制度转向和平自由民主的过程中比其他任何国家都更需要美国。	This might seem ironic, coming from a German and a confirmed Atlanticist, but it is actually fitting, because Germany, in its transformation from a murderous dictatorship into a peaceful liberal democracy, needed the US more than any country.
考虑到前几个月欧元汇率的走向和欧元区经济的缓慢发展，我们预计通货膨胀率会略有下降，而后会在2%左右徘徊。	Given the movements in the euro’s exchange rate in previous months and sluggish growth in the euro area, we expected that inflation rates would decline, but only to levels close to 2%.
自危机爆发以来，希腊得到了来自所谓的“三驾马车 ” — —欧盟委员会、欧洲央行和国际货币基金组织（IMF）的巨额融资。	Since the onset of the crisis, Greece has received massive financing from the so-called “troika”: the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.
外国政府和IMF会扩大对新政府的救命融资线吗？ 还是会让新政府自生自灭，任由其被货币贬值和通货膨胀的漩涡吞噬？	Will foreign governments and the International Monetary Fund extend vital finances to the new government, or will they let it flounder and drown in a tsunami of currency depreciation and inflation?
而承担这些责任也为企业建立起了“良好”形象，正如参与慈善事业为比尔·盖茨和沃伦·巴菲特这些亿万富翁建立起了“富贵善人”形象一样。	Such CSR builds the firm’s image as a “good” corporation, just as giving by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet builds their image as “good” billionaires.
他们想继续泡在媒体舆论中，但如果这些贸易保护主义者在对中国的责难中走得太远太快，人们就会觉得他们妨碍了微妙的幕后谈判。	They want to keep bathing in press coverage, but if they push their China-bashing too far and too fast, the protectionists will be seen as hindering delicate behind-the-scenes negotiations.
这份排名囊括了经济学家、心理学家、作家、政治学家、物理学家、人类学家、信息科学家、生物学家、企业家、神学家、医生和其他各学科的专家。	The ranking includes economists, psychologists, authors, political scientists, physicists, anthropologists, information scientists, biologists, entrepreneurs, theologians, physicians, and people from several other disciplines.
在经历了多年年均5%的经济增长后，全球不确定性、大宗商品价格低迷以及不利的外部条件有可能破坏几十年来急需的进步。	After years during which the continent’s economy grew at an average annual rate of 5%, global uncertainty, depressed commodity prices, and jittery external conditions are threatening to undermine decades of much-needed progress.
被他们看作统治地位的盎格鲁-萨克逊的经济政策 — — 法国虚构的“例外”政策的致命一击 — — 向他们发出了警告。	They are alarmed by what they see as the domination of Anglo-Saxon economic principles – the last nail in the coffin of France’s mythical “exception.”
60年前，美国士兵眼中的阿拉克不过是个盛产葡萄小村庄，而今天，它在五角大楼官员的眼里却是一座工业城市，与伊朗令人不安的核计划息息相关。	Sixty years ago, Arak was a humble village known to US troops for its grapes; today Pentagon officials hone in on it as an industrial city that is integral to Iran’s worrisome nuclear program.
说到如何实现这一目标的线索，作曲家佐尔坦·科达伊的某些想法值得研究，我最近赴匈牙利旅行时遇到了他的遗孀，而我之所以接到邀请不仅因为我是一名经济学家，还因为我同为一名音乐家的抱负。	For some clues as to how that can be done, it is worth examining the ideas of the composer Zoltán Kodály, whose widow I met on a recent trip to Hungary, where I was invited not just as an economist, but also as an aspiring musician.
中国人对十九世纪的鸦片战争依然记忆犹新 — — 当时这个“中央帝国”尝试抵制英国迫使其开放鸦片及其他进口产品的举措，但却饮恨而归。	The Chinese remember well the Opium Wars of the nineteenth century, when the Middle Kingdom tried and failed to resist the British campaign to force it to open its economy to opium and other imports.
“这项政策不会有效，因为客户想要的是平价能源 ， ” 他说 ， “ 它们想要更低而不是更高的能源价格 。 ”	“It’s not a policy that is going to be effective, because customers want affordable energy,” he said. “They want low energy prices, not high energy prices.”
例如，如果美国对钢铁产品实施25%的全面进口关税，并且进口额降至150亿美元 — — 也就是2017年进口额的一半 — — 美国仍将获得37.5亿美元的额外年度收入。	For example, if the US imposed an across-the-board import tariff of 25% on steel products, and imports collapsed to $15 billion – one-half of their 2017 value – the US would still acquire an extra $3.75 billion in annual revenues.
华盛顿—特朗普正在进行履新总统后的第一次出访，而他解雇联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey）所引起的混乱以及对他在竞选期间勾结俄罗斯正在纠缠着他。	WASHINGTON, DC – As Donald Trump’s first foreign trip as president proceeds, the turmoil generated by his firing of FBI Director James Comey and the ongoing inquiry into his election campaign’s ties with Russia are following him.
或许在总统候选人的下一次辩论中，参与者应该从道德角度阐述攻击科学进程的政客和破坏古代文物的伊斯兰国之间有何区别。	Perhaps at the next debate among presidential candidates, participants should have to distinguish – from a moral standpoint – politicians attacking the scientific process from Islamic State militants destroying ancient artifacts.
这就是好时与美国国际开发署（USAID）和ECOM（我们最大的加纳可可供应商）开展新合作项目背后的动机。	That is the motivation behind Hershey’s new partnership with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and ECOM, our biggest cocoa supplier in Ghana.
"《科学》杂志认为，冰岛""孤立的地理位置""和""导致该国多数人口死亡""的严重灾难使得现有的基因组合""高度一致 "" 。"	"According to the magazine Science , Iceland's ""isolated position"" and catastrophes that ""wiped out large parts of [its] population"" have left it with ""a remarkably homogenic gene pool."""
分析结果显示如果印度拉贾斯坦邦要仿效其他邦豁免对两公顷以下土地所有者的正式贷款，那么付出的成本将达到1，174亿卢比（合17亿美元 ） 。	His analysis shows that if, for example, the Indian state of Rajasthan were to copy other states and waive formal loans for land holders with less than two hectares, this would cost 117.4 billion rupees ($1.7 billion).
德国和欧盟也可以提供贷款承诺，但是这不如 IMF 贷款来得好，因为此类承诺难以附加一些贷款条件，就算附加了也难以执行。	Loan guarantees from Germany and/or the EU are less desirable than an IMF program, as it is very hard to design and credibly implement conditionality in such guarantees.
此外，G-20还采取措施鼓励所有司法官辖区都签由欧盟理事会和经合组织共同提出的署税收问题互助管理多边公约（Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters ） 。	Moreover, the G-20 has launched efforts to encourage all jurisdictions to sign the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, developed jointly by the Council of Europe and the OECD.
要求建立新的全球储备体系所基于的核心观点相当简单：长期来看，国际货币体系不可能建立在一个主权国家的货币之上 — — 比利时裔美国人罗伯特·特里芬早在半个世纪之前就表达了这样的观点。	The essential idea is quite simple: in the long run, an international monetary system cannot be built on a national currency – a point made a half-century ago by the Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin.
类似的是，中间派领导人弗郎索瓦·贝胡保证对金融交易征收“托宾税 ” （ 根据该税的倡导者、诺贝尔经济学奖得主詹母斯·托宾的名字命名 ） ， 其收益用于支持具有社会价值的事业。	Similarly, the centrist leader François Bayrou, has proposed imposing a “Tobin tax” (named after its creator, the Nobel laureate economist James Tobin) on financial transactions, with the proceeds to be used to support socially worthy causes.
当石油价格在一天之内暴跌10%时，显然具有短期破坏性：不同资源和相关部门间信用利差暴增，杠杆投资者被迫甩卖资产以满足保证金要求。	When oil prices plunge by 10% daily, this is obviously disruptive in the short term: credit spreads in resources and related sectors explode, and leveraged investors are forced into asset fire sales to meet margin calls.
尽管这带来的是可比性甚低的指标族，仍然有待标准化，但这些努力是令人鼓舞的信号 — — 微观金融业开始致力于捍卫其在金融服务生态系统中的地位。	While this has resulted in a rather disparate set of indicators, which must be standardized, such efforts are an encouraging sign of the microfinance industry’s commitment to securing its role in the financial-services ecosystem.
最后，我们不能忽视悬而未决的以巴冲突的破坏力，它仍在助长政治极端主义、滋生严重威胁西方人权承诺的问题。	Finally, we should not ignore the continuing toxicity of the unresolved Israel-Palestine conflict, which continues to feed political extremism and raises serious questions about the West’s commitment to human rights.
在五月对加沙舰队的致命袭击中，内塔尼亚胡政府显示出某种政治自闭症倾向，它没有意识到即使是以色列最好的朋友也不愿再接受加沙封锁所带来的人道主义后果。	In its deadly assault on the Gaza flotilla in May, Netanyahu’s government demonstrated a kind of political autism in its inability to realize that even Israel’s best friends no longer wish to accept the humanitarian consequences of the Gaza blockade.
会议聚集了来自160多个国家的创业者、投资人、研究人员和决策者，共同分享最佳经验、支持初创企业的发展并建设有利于其运营的生态系统。	The gathering brought together entrepreneurs, investors, researchers, and policymakers from more than 160 countries to share best practices and work to bolster startup growth and build the ecosystems in which they operate.
由于慈善捐款只有在捐赠者获得的附带价值不超过其捐赠额时才可在联邦一级抵扣税，而上述州法案安排显然不属于这种情况。	Charitable contributions are deductible at the federal level only if the donor receives no more than incidental value for the contribution, which obviously wouldn’t be the case in this situation.
20世纪50年代开始公开发布的信心指数以调查为基础，消费者和商界人士被询问关于商业活动和未来收入和就业预期的感觉。	Published confidence indices, available since the 1950s, are based on polls that ask consumers or businesspeople about their perceptions of business activity and expectations of future income and employment.
但他承诺将延长小布什的减税计划，同时追加削减20%的全面所得税率并把公司税率从35%降至25 % ， 以此帮助经济摆脱财政悬崖。	But he vows to steer the economy from the fiscal cliff by extending the tax cuts enacted under George W. Bush, doubling down with a further 20% across-the-board cut in income-tax rates and cutting the corporate rate from 35% to 25%.
资源被持续不断地用于开发更多石油和天然气，这不是因为石油和天然气对美国或世界有益，而是 因为埃克森美孚、雪佛龙、康菲（Conoco Philips）和其他石油巨头的股东和管理层要求这么做。	Resources are relentlessly allocated to developing more oil and gas fields not because they are good for America or the world, but because the shareholders and managers of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Conoco Philipps, and others demand it.
现在，默克尔必须决定如何制造一个妥协不令泛欧洲民主进程失去信誉。 目前，欧洲民主进程在德国所获得的支持多于任何一个其他欧洲大国。	Merkel must now determine how to forge a compromise that does not discredit the Europe-wide democratic process, which currently has more support in Germany than in any other large European country.
他们将伊拉克所有问题一股脑推到带领受人尊敬的达瓦党登上大什叶派联盟宝座的意志坚定的什叶派政治家、总理努里·马利基身上，马利基也凭借这次成功于2010年12月再次登上了总理宝座。	They lay all the blame for Iraq’s problems at the door of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a tough-minded Shia politician who has led the venerable Dawa Party to the head of a broad Shia coalition that helped him win a second term in December 2010.
即便在2030年之前能够充分实施巴黎气候协定，也只能实现将升温幅度限制在2℃以内所需减排量的1 % （ 据联合国数据 ） 。	The Paris climate agreement, even if fully implemented up to 2030, would achieve just 1% of the cuts needed to keep temperature from rising more than 2oC, according to the UN.
问题不仅在于我在剑桥大学的同事詹妮·潘所提出的，设计计算机的初衷是让它像企业一样思考，而是计算机也在模仿经济学家的思考方式。	The problem is not just that computers are designed to think like corporations, as my University of Cambridge colleague Jonnie Penn has argued. It is also that computers think like economists.
随着两位学者发现针对旧有世俗体制的几起耸人听闻的法律案件证据纯属伪造，正义与发展党官员开始将所有司法领域的不当行为都推到居伦头上。	With two academics having already revealed that several sensational legal cases against the old secular establishment rested on fabricated evidence, AKP officials began to blame Gülen for all judicial improprieties.
而主要的两种批评声音 — — 其一是认为报告缺乏战略清晰度，二是对权力的经典概念缺乏足够重视 — — 指出了美国在国际影响力，权力以及领导地位等方面的式微。	The two main criticisms – lack of strategic clarity and less emphasis on the classical concepts of power – point to America’s loss of influence, power, and leadership.
但是，如果高油价是由于投机引起的，那么，政策制定者就必须行动起来制止给全球经济施加了巨大且不必要的成本的行为，并且，当面对证据的时候，它也会指出投机是罪魁祸首。	But if they are due to speculation, then policymakers speculators must act to rein in behavior that has imposed huge and needless costs on the global economy. And, when the evidence is confronted, it points to speculation as a culprit.
但有效的培训计划所需要的不仅仅是钱；也需要能识别必要技能、创造教授这些技能的结构、让受过培训的工人与可获得的岗位匹配的雇主和教育者。	But effective programs require more than just money; they need employers and educators who can identify the necessary skills, create the structures to teach them, and match trained workers with available jobs.
随着演出落幕，掌声渐息，也是时候好好查看一下奥巴马此行的“资产负债表 ” ， 看看这位总统究竟得到了什么，又丢掉了什么。	Now that the play is over and the applause has died down, it is time to check the balance sheet and see how much Obama achieved and how much he conceded.
新兴国家外汇储备总量自1994年以来首次出现下降。 从1994年开始，新兴市场外汇储备大幅攀升，成为过去二十年来全球经济的一个显著特征。	And the aggregate foreign-exchange reserves held by emerging countries declined for the first time since 1994, when they began the steep upward climb that has been a defining feature of the global economy during the last two decades.
在赫尔辛基，普京确认他就是想特朗普赢得大选 — — 显然，这是一个老谋深算之举，他知道会这将坐实特朗普在选战中与克里姆林宫勾结的指控。	In Helsinki, Putin confirmed that he had wanted Trump to win the election – a calculated move, no doubt, that he knew would seem to corroborate accusations that Trump’s presidential campaign colluded with the Kremlin.
因此这一结果强烈表明：如果所有美国人都有机会对禁锢怀孕母猪和肉牛的问题投票表决，绝大多数人会选择说不。	So the results strongly suggest that if all Americans were given a chance to vote on keeping pregnant pigs and calves in such tight confinement, the majority would vote no.
但是即便她未能赢得多数，脱欧进程也不会停止，除非每个反脱欧议员都能支持一个临时政府并投票要求第二次公投。	But even if she fails to win a majority, Brexit would not be stopped, unless every anti-Brexit Member of Parliament were to back a temporary government and vote to hold a second national referendum.
毕竟，基本收入仍然十分有限，也没有办法确保个人会将其中足够多的部分用于实现有利于社会的教育、医疗和营养水平。	After all, the basic income would still be severely limited, and there is no way to ensure that individuals would allocate enough of it to achieve socially desirable education, health, or nutrition levels.
但当这一事务在2008年摆在加利福尼亚州选民面前时，他们一面倒地支持一个立场：农场饲养的所有动物都应当拥有可以充分伸展四肢羽翼并在转身时不致碰到其他动物或者笼壁的空间。	But, when the issue was put to California voters in 2008, they overwhelmingly supported a proposition requiring that all farm animals have room to stretch their limbs fully and turn around without touching other animals or the sides of their cage.
此外，在过去20年中由于中国的崛起以及亚洲拉丁美洲和其他地区的经济发展，各国之间的经济不平等状况得到了大幅改善。	Moreover, economic inequality among countries has declined sharply in the past 20 years, owing partly to China’s rise, as well as to economic development across Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere.
但对于生存于如此一个复杂现代文化中的人们来说，生物因素对某些特性的影响虽然微小，但在长期重复和积累之后必将最终显现出来。	But, while the effects of biology on the traits that we measured are relatively small for humans living in complex modern cultures, even small effects, when repeated consistently, will accumulate.
弦外之音是美国和欧洲的左右翼民粹主义势力崛起是全球化及其负面影响的直接后果：相关负面影响包括失业和中产阶级收入停滞。	The underlying view is that rising populism on the right and the left, both in the United States and in Europe, is a straightforward consequence of globalization and its unwanted effects: lost jobs and stagnant middle-class incomes.
有人可能会说他们赢得了大奖，通过操纵一场从未期望特朗普能赢的选举将很小一笔赌注连本带利演变成巨大的回报。	One might say they won the jackpot, parlaying a small bet – on manipulating the outcome of an election they most likely never expected him to win – into a huge payoff.
当我们在估算可持续发展水平时计入与这些极限相关的消极风险，则世界富国财富增长的结果可能并不如我们想象中那样好。	When the downside risks associated with such limits and thresholds are brought into estimates of sustainable development, the growth in wealth among the world’s wealthy nations will probably turn out to have been less than we now think.
卢拉政府模棱两可的外交立场同样表现在核扩散问题上。 巴西在上世纪六十年代签署了特拉特洛尔科条约,为履行条约规定的在拉丁美洲禁止核武器的义务，巴西在九十年代拆除了其铀浓缩设备并解散了相关研究机构，随后在1998年批准了核不扩散条约。	Then, in May of this year, Lula teamed up with Turkey in proposing a deal with Iran on its nuclear program, which the latter nominally accepted but the rest of the world did not.
他们是在一个错误的观念下徒劳地工作着 — — 金融市场能够纠正其自身的过剩，因此只需设计解决公共部门过剩问题的规则就行了。	They labored under the misconception that financial markets can correct their own excesses, so the rules were designed to rein in only public-sector excesses.
2011年，IBM的沃森（Watson）标志了另一座AI分水平，它在“危险 ！ ” （Jeopardy ! ） 游戏中击败两位前冠军。	In 2011, IBM’s Watson marked another AI watershed, by beating two previous champions in Jeopardy!, a game that combines general knowledge with lateral thinking.
不管你是否同意，有一点是显而易见的：帝国主义并非如某些道貌岸然的英国辩护者所说的那样，是无私的事业（altruistic enterprise ） 。	Whether or not one agrees, one thing is clear: imperialism was not, as some disingenuous British apologists have claimed, an altruistic enterprise.
事实上，许多东欧人在战后的残酷社会主义实验时期也有一种失控感，许多中国人在文化大革命时期亦然，而这些社会的收入不平等性可以忽略不计。	Indeed, many people in Eastern Europe felt a sense of lost control during the harsh socialist experiments of the post-war era, as did many Chinese during the Cultural Revolution, and these societies had minimal visible income inequality.
但是事实是，在格林斯潘年代，基本商品价格下滑而且中国的通货紧缩帮助限制了制造业商品的价格，美国从中受益。	But the truth is that America in the Greenspan years benefited from a period of declining commodity prices, and from deflation in China, which helped keep prices of manufactured goods in check.
发自纽约 — — 眼下已是纪念雷曼兄弟破产十周年之时，但关于此次金融危机的前因后果，以及人们是否已经吸收了足够教训以避免下一次危机的争论却仍未平息。	NEW YORK – As we mark the decennial of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, there are still ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of the financial crisis, and whether the lessons needed to prepare for the next one have been absorbed.
更糟的是，谢钦秘密录制的自己与乌卢卡耶夫的谈话记录 — — 在这次诱捕行动中谢钦发挥了主要作用 — — 在今年9月对外界公布。	Particularly damning, transcripts of Sechin’s secret recordings of his conversation with Ulyukaev – part of a sting operation in which Sechin played a leading role – were disclosed in September.
对这种幻想的有意识阐释是对生物死亡确定性的一种痴迷的回应：即一个信念，认为这种在科学游戏中取胜的重大意义能使胜利者获得某种形式的永生，从而战胜死亡本身。	The conscious expression of this dream is an obsessive response to the certainty of biological death: the belief that a big enough win in the game of science will beat death itself by conferring a form of immortality on the winner.
如果情况果真如此的话，欧洲央行可以令人信服地争辩说是默克尔的改革和美国，而不是它的提高利率应该为欧洲经济的放缓负责。	The ECB could convincingly argue that Merkel’s reforms and the US, not its interest-rate hikes, are responsible for the European slowdown, should one occur.
经济增长的需要将成为推动政客采取市场导向的经济政策（这对“社会公正”十分重要）和开放的投资环境的内因。	The need for economic growth could intrinsically push policymakers toward market-oriented economic policies (sensitive to considerations of “social justice”) and an open investment environment.
类似地，2000年，巴拉克总理也赞同克林顿参数（Clinton Parameters ） ， 设想将耶路撒冷根据种族成分划分为两个首都。	Likewise, in 2000, Prime Minister Ehud Barak endorsed the Clinton Parameters, which called for Jerusalem’s division into two capitals along ethnic lines.
目前，最有杀伤力的曝光是周滨与亿万富豪刘汉之间的朋友关系。 刘汉目前正在以有组织犯罪和谋杀罪名待审，他的发迹与周滨的帮助不无关系。	The most damaging revelation so far concerns Zhou Bin’s friendship with a billionaire mafia boss, Liu Han, who is now standing trial for organized crime and murder.
事实上，发达经济体需要出台中期计划，通过对高质量教育、职业培训和人力资本改善、基础设施以及替代/可再生能源的大手笔新投资来重塑竞争力、创造就业岗位。	Instead, the advanced economies need a medium-term plan to restore competitiveness and jobs via massive new investments in high-quality education, job training and human-capital improvements, infrastructure, and alternative/renewable energy.
类似地，印度因为伯南克暗示美联储将“减弱”QE而严重受创，但这只是因为其经济出现了高通胀和庞大的预算和外部赤字。	Likewise, India was severely affected by Bernanke’s suggestion that the Fed would “taper” QE, but only because its economy was characterized by high inflation and large budget and external deficits.
由于美国和欧洲要么缺乏兴趣，要么缺乏资金，无法有效应对中东的剧变局势，因此解决方案至少部分需要来自拥有强大影响力的国家。	Given that the US and Europe have neither the appetite nor the wherewithal to respond effectively to the cataclysmic developments in the Middle East, solutions will need to come, at least partly, from countries with strong influence on the ground.
奥巴马总统的注意力现在集中在刺激美国疲软的经济、制定减税政策、改革能源和医疗保健政策并恢复人们对美国金融机构的信心等方面。	President Barack Obama’s attention is now concentrated on stimulating the anemic US economy, crafting tax cuts, reforming energy and health-care policies, and restoring confidence in US financial institutions.
前手机大亨叶甫盖尼·契克瓦尔金（Yevgeny Chichvarkin）自2009年逃离俄罗斯以来一直在积极地组织反对普京。	Yevgeny Chichvarkin, a former mobile phone tycoon, has actively campaigned against Putin since fleeing Russia in 2009.
世界在扶贫和扩大饮用水普及面等方面取得了大量进展，但并没有在20世纪90年代趋势的基础上取得本可以实现的重大改善。	While the world made major gains in tackling hunger and expanding access to drinking water, it did not significantly improve upon what could have been expected relative to 1990s trends.
在9月25日的重要会议上，联合国大会一致决定SDG应该在2015年9月的全球峰会上推出，未来两年时间将用于决定优先事项。	In an important meeting on September 25, the United Nations General Assembly agreed that the SDGs would be adopted at a global summit in September 2015, with the next two years used to select the priorities.
拜2011年预算控制法案的“隔离”规则所赐，防务开支水平被要求从2012年占GDP的4.3%下降到2023年占GDP的2.8 % ， 这也是自二战以来最低的GDP占比。	Because of the “sequester” rule in the Budget Control Act of 2011, the level of defense outlays is required to decline from 4.3% of GDP in 2012 to just 2.8% of GDP in 2023, the lowest GDP share since World War II.
这种做法被称为“确保死亡 ” 。 对以色列领土的火箭袭击明显是意在转移注意力并使哈马斯能以巴勒斯坦事业的真正英雄的形象获得民众支持。	The rocket attacks against Israeli territory are a transparent attempt to divert attention and rally the masses around Hamas as the true champions of the Palestinian cause.
一位女美国总统候选人赢得了多数女性选票，总票数也多于她的男性对手，但她的策略没有吸引足够选票以保证胜利。	A female US presidential candidate has now won a majority of women’s votes, and more total votes than her male opponent, and yet her strategy failed to deliver enough votes to secure a victory.
库尔德问题困扰着土耳其，除此之外，越来越多的土耳其人感到他们正在失去对两大关键问题的控制，即叙利亚和伊朗危机。	The Kurdish problem preoccupies Turks, as does their growing sense that they are losing control of two essential issues – the Syrian and Iranian crises.

但是，同样重要的是总统奥巴马对科罗拉多州和华盛顿州投票的反应 — — 在总统连任竞选过程中，奥巴马在这两个州中轻松获胜。	Just as important, however, was President Barack Obama’s reaction to the Colorado and Washington votes – both states that he won easily in his re-election bid.
在过去十年中，出口增长为中国的整体经济增长贡献了大约三分之一，而在中国的出口中，又有三分之一去向了欧盟。	In the last decade, export growth has accounted for roughly one-third of China’s overall economic growth, and about one-third of Chinese exports went to the European Union.
事实上，另一项对于1213名病人在中风后六个月所作的14项随机调查的统计，对有否运用针灸作为一种针对传统中风康复护理的补充治疗手段的效果进行了对比。	Indeed, another analysis, including 14 randomized trials with 1,213 patients six months after a stroke, compared the effects of conventional stroke rehabilitation with and without acupuncture as a supplement.
中国历史以来都致力于把邻国变成自己的附庸 — — 这种心态在它与越南、菲律宾就南中国海问题进行协商时就已暴露无遗了。	Throughout its history, China has sought to treat its neighbors as vassals – a mindset currently reflected in the way that it has approached negotiations with Vietnam and the Philippines over the South China Sea.
此外，一项关于不公平钢材进口所带来的国家安全威胁的所谓232条款调查行动也是死死盯住了中国这个全球最大的钢铁生产国。	Moreover, a so-called Section 232 investigation into the national security threat posed by unfair steel imports also takes dead aim at China as the world’s largest steel producer.
但是，在另一方面却是大量无助的伊拉克人，包括那些寡妇、离婚或者遭到抛弃的妇女。 没有人帮助她们和她们的孩子。	On the other side, however, remains the vast population of powerless Iraqis, including widows and divorced or abandoned women with no one to provide for them and their children.
他们中的绝大多数把票投给了左翼联盟。 左翼联盟想重新配置资源，将资源用于提高工资和补贴，在其增长战略中甚至没有提到出口。	A large plurality of them voted for Syriza, which wants to reallocate resources to wage increases and subsidies and does not even mention exports in its growth strategy.
在内政方面，萨尔柯齐把重点放在了青年人身上，力求唤起他们的爱国热情，建立勤于工作和遵纪守法的价值观，这是一场反对革命的革命。	At home, Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young, issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline, a counter-revolutionary revolution.
不仅产能过剩对增长具有消极影响，也许更重要的是，急剧下降的增长也会导致某些行业的大规模冗余（特别是资源业、重工业和化工业 ） 。	Not only does excess capacity have a negative impact on growth; perhaps more important, sharply declining growth also contributes to massive redundancy in some industries (especially resources and the heavy and chemical industries).
通过储蓄和投资基本面来定义实际利率的变化发展，一个明显的推断就是央行和金融市场都可以粗略地摸索到均衡实际利率随时间的变化规律。	By identifying the evolution of real interest rates with saving and investment fundamentals, the implicit assumption is that the central bank and financial markets can roughly track the evolution of the equilibrium real rate over time.
在这个独一无二的受控制 — — 并可控制 — — 社会，源自经济破坏的常见经济压力都可以游刃有余地得到管理。	And in such a uniquely controlled – and controllable – society, the normal social stresses that arise from economic disruptions are eminently manageable.
但该组织的秘密性、其对于反对其管理者的人的恐吓，以及其对惠赠、贿赂和债务的依赖确实与有组织犯罪没什么区别。	But the organization’s secrecy, its intimidation of the rivals to those who run it, and its reliance on favors, bribes, and called debts do show disturbing parallels to the world of organized crime.
虽然特朗普颇具影响力的子女开始时偏爱马纳福特，但当他开始吸引负面媒体关注（包括特朗普迄今为止与普京莫名其妙的亲密关系）时这一切都发生了改变。	While Trump’s influential children had initially favored Manafort, that changed when he started to attract the wrong kind of media attention, including questions about Trump’s so-far inexplicable affinity for Putin.
希腊的经验彰显出一个常常被忽略的宏观经济政策真相：世界不是由紧缩派主宰的；相反，大部分国家都存在平衡报表的麻烦。	Greece's experience highlights a truth about macroeconomic policy that is too often overlooked: The world is not dominated by austerians; on the contrary, most countries have trouble balancing their books.
换句话讲，假设你个人的直觉信仰迫使你踏上没有千斤顶、卸胎棒或任何地图或导航系统等基本工具的一次漫长的汽车旅行。	To put it another way, suppose that your own personal intuited notion of how to travel obliges you to embark on a long car journey without basic supplies like a jack and a tire iron or any kind of map or navigation system.
因此，必须让女性彻底与世隔绝，不在公众场合抛头露面，因为女性出现在学校、医院、公园或市场可能点燃的欲望都要由她们自己负责。	As a result, women must be strictly secluded and made invisible when in public, for they are personally responsible for the desire that they could ignite in schools, hospitals, parks, or markets.
2001年9月（在纽约和华盛顿发生恐怖袭击后）商业信心有所下降，当时美国财政部长是保罗·奥尼尔（Paul O’Neill ） 。	Business confidence fell in September 2001 (following the terror attacks on New York and Washington, DC), while Paul O’Neill was US Treasury Secretary.
为了达到艰难的预算指标，欧洲国家的领导人浪费了很多政治精力和资本，而同时对于一些真正有挑战性的关键问题却没有采取任何措施：如，人口老龄化，高税负，日益削减的竞争力。	European leaders waste political energy and capital to meet demanding budget targets, while nothing is done to address the really vital challenges: aging populations, high tax burdens, declining competitiveness.
因此黄金依然是约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯所谓的“野蛮的遗迹 ” ， 并无真实价值，主要被作为非理性恐惧和恐慌的抵抗物。	So gold remains John Maynard Keynes’s “barbarous relic,” with no intrinsic value and used mainly as a hedge against mostly irrational fear and panic.
至于威尼斯黄金储备被耗尽的问题，法布罗提供了一个巧妙的解决办法：采用纸币威尼斯元，可以强迫其他国家接受威尼斯元，因为威尼斯是世界第一大贸易强国。	As for the depletion of Venice’s stores of gold, Fabbro offers an ingenious solution: a paper currency, the Venetian dollar (V$), which other countries could be compelled to accept, because Venice was the world’s top trading power.
那些有充足理由去恐惧俄罗斯停供天然气的国家都为此大声呼吁，认为兴建北溪管道的政治目的远大于经济需要。	Countries that have good reason to fear a Russian manufactured chill have loudly proclaimed that Nord Stream is politically rather than economically motivated.
而和这几次选举一样，他本人的政党意大利前进党（Forza Italia）的主要合作伙伴将是分离主义、反移民、疑欧派的北方联盟（Northern League ） 。	And, as in those elections, his own party, Forza Italia, will have as its main partner the separatist, anti-immigrant, and Euroskeptic Northern League.
未来，数据挖掘、人工智能和区块链等新技术可以提供全新方法来检测医疗部门的违法行为；应当充分调查上述和其它工具。	In the future, new technologies like data mining, artificial intelligence, and blockchain could offer new ways to detect wrongdoing in the health sector; these and other tools should be investigated fully.
那些借助人权来宣扬战争或者像这个世界那样借助人权来开展政治宣传者恰恰对他们声称捍卫的理想是一种侮辱。	Those who invoke human rights to promote wars or, as with This World, to make political propaganda, degrade the very ideals for which they claim to be fighting.
在玻利维亚，总统莫拉莱斯的2009年新宪法禁止三度连选连任，但如今宪法法院批准他连任，指出玻利维亚国已经“重建 ” 。	In Bolivia, President Evo Morales’s new 2009 constitution banned reelection to a third consecutive term, but now the Constitutional Court has allowed him to run, arguing that the Bolivian state has been “refounded.”
在结构性问题上，经济和人均收入与美国相近的两个经济体 — — 欧洲和日本 — — 都是美国的盟友，这十分重要。	In structural terms, it matters greatly that the two entities in the world with economies and per capita income similar to the US – Europe and Japan – are both American allies.
如果毫无节制的恐怖分子再像伊斯兰杰哈德1993年在埃及或者扎卡维2005年在安曼那样去杀害无辜的穆斯林民众，损害的将是他们自己的软性力量，失去的是民众对他们的支持。	When terrorist excesses killed innocent Muslim civilians such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad did in 1993 or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi did in Amman in 2005, they undercut their own soft power and lost support.
为了实现这一目标 — — 并在此过程中避免产生抗生素耐药性 — — 就必须花费更多的资金用于疫苗研究和开发。	To accomplish that goal – and stave off AMR in the process – significantly more money must be spent on vaccine research and development.
1958年到1985年期间，大约5万名苏联作家、记者、官员、音乐家、舞蹈家、运动员和学者访问了美国。	Some 50,000 Soviets – writers, journalists, officials, musicians, dancers, athletes, and academics – visited the United States between 1958 and 1988.
约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）最近指出，如果当年德国失业率没有高大30 % ， 希特勒就不会上台。	As Joseph Stiglitz recently pointed out, it is unlikely that Hitler would have come to power in Germany if the unemployment rate was not 30% at the time.
如果冒着过度概括的微小风险的话，我们可以说第一个阵营主要由北欧人组成，而第二个阵营则是南欧人做主角。	At the slight risk of overgeneralization, one can say that the first camp was made up mainly of northern Europeans, while the second was dominated by the south.
许多波兰人看到政府终于肯为普通人做事，而颇具讽刺意味的是，所有自由主义者能做的就是抱怨这项政策反民主。	Many Poles see a government that finally does something for ordinary people, and all liberals can do is complain, ironically, that it is anti-democratic.
抗脆弱性对中国这样的大国至关重要，因为中央政府行政权力相对集中，但日常活动主体却分散在家庭、民间团体、市场和各级地方政府。	Antifragility is crucial in large economies like China, where administration is largely centralized, but activities are dispersed among families, civil society, markets, and the various levels of government.
直到最近，预算责任办公室 — — 大致与国际货币基金组织一样 — — 都依然采用0.6的财政乘数：也就是政府每减少一美元的支出，经济只会收缩60美分。	Until recently, the OBR, broadly in line with the IMF, assumed a fiscal multiplier of 0.6: for every dollar cut from government spending, the economy would shrink by only 60 cents.
结果产生了另一个阿拉伯之春悖论：在一个看似满足了伊斯兰教全面获胜的所有条件的国家，却产生了埃及和突尼斯自由派梦寐以求的选举结果。	The result was yet another paradox of the Arab Spring: a country that seemed to meet all of the conditions for an Islamist victory produced the sort of election results that liberals in Egypt and Tunisia could only dream about.
而针对妇女的暴力行为之所以在阿富汗屡禁不止，是由许多原因的：首先，该国继承了一个男权部落传统，认为女性就是低人一等，并因此剥夺了女性的基本权利和自由。	First, the country has inherited a patriarchal tribal tradition that assumes women’s inferiority. Women are therefore deprived of their basic rights and freedoms.
意义重大、至关重要的思想是，发展中和新兴市场经济体，如巴西、印度、印尼、南非和中国等，已经强大到无法将它们排除在全球治理问题的讨论之外。	The relevant and important idea is that developing and emerging market economies such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and China have become too significant to be excluded from discussions about global governance.
而现在随着美国众议院否决布什政府提出的7000亿美元救市计划，很显然我们在如何解决危机方面也没有达成共识。	And now, with the US House of Representatives having rejected the Bush administration’s proposed $700 billion bailout plan, it is also obvious that there is no consensus on how to fix it.
但目前的情况是，由养老基金、人寿保险企业和其他机构所管理的68万亿美元资金中仅有不到百分之一流向了基础设施投资。	As it stands, however, less than 1% of the $68 trillion managed by pension funds, life insurance companies, and others are channeled toward infrastructure projects.
经济停滞已经对日本的年轻人造成了很大影响，令他们很难找到工作，更不要说在全球领先的企业谋到一份终身职位。	Stagnation is already having a big impact on Japan’s young, for whom it is becoming hard to find a job, let alone life-long employment in a leading global company.
对玻利维亚，厄瓜多尔和委内瑞拉经验的客观、实证研究表明，那些名义上具备包容性的民粹主义政策都伴随着太过高昂的成本。	An objective, empirical examination of the experience of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela demonstrates that nominally inclusive populist policies have come at far too high a cost.
战火燃起时美国总统奥巴马可能已经离任，但如果真出大问题，他有可能像茫然不知其和平意图后果的政治家内维尔·张伯伦那样留在人们的记忆中。	US President Barack Obama may not be in office when the fire ignites, but if things do go terribly wrong, he may be remembered as another statesman who, like Neville Chamberlain, was blind to the consequences of his peaceful intentions.
资产负债表方面的巨大改善使新兴国家能够在2008—2009年的全球金融危机中迅速复苏，而西方国家则一直在泥淖中苦苦挣扎。	This sharp balance-sheet improvement has been instrumental in enabling emerging countries to bounce back strongly from the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, whereas the West continues to hobble along.
中国官方外汇储备有一大部分是因为人民银行试图控制人民币汇率而积累起来的 — — 在人民币升值过程中，人民银行一直在强调渐进性和可控性。	Much of China’s official foreign reserves have accumulated because the PBC seeks to control the renminbi’s exchange rate, keeping its upward movement within a reasonable range and at a measured pace.
说到底，如果说当前趋势发展利用了什么神话的话，那就是将央行行长视为技术官僚，能够超然于他们所处时代的政治和意识形态之外。	The bottom line is that if there is one myth that recent developments have exploded it is probably the one that sees central bankers as technocrats, hovering independently over the politics and ideologies of their time.
很多人已经拿纳税人的钱再次回到赌桌，并开始推销所谓新的“金融产品 ” 。 他们清楚如果再来一次危机，纳税人除了再次为他们埋单外依然别无选择。	Quite a few of them are already back at the table gambling away with the taxpayer’s money and peddling their new “financial products”; they know that when the next crash comes, the taxpayer will have no choice but to bail them out again.
人工智能以大数据为基础，而数据的可获得性从根本上讲是一个政治问题，涉及诸如隐私，透明度，安全性和框定经济竞争的规则等问题。	AI is based on big data, and the availability of data is fundamentally a political matter that implicates issues such as privacy, transparency, security, and the rules that frame economic competition.
鉴于它过去的经济成就和政府对大手笔改革议程的坚定承诺，中国可以应对这一企业债务挑战，但如果不立刻动手，就来不及了。	Given its record of economic success and the government’s strong commitment to an ambitious reform agenda, China can rise to the challenge. But it must start now.
毒品在墨西哥的使用是否在向更广大的人群扩散，还不明确：毒品成瘾增长的速度惊人具有误导性，因为成瘾的数字是从极低的基数开始的。	It is unclear that drug use in Mexico is extending more widely into the population: alarming rates of addiction growth are misleading, because addiction starts from an extremely low base.
在所有地方，这样的变化都使最不幸的那部分人口大规模地陷入贫困，而在富庶国家，似乎已经在20世纪80年代被彻底消灭的大规模贫困又重新死灰复燃。	Everywhere, this has meant massive pauperization of the least favored part of the population. In rich countries, mass poverty, which seemed to have been eliminated around 1980, has reappeared.
印度情报官员宣称BNP某联盟伙伴领导人，Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini与被取缔的伊斯兰武装团体孟加拉伊斯兰圣战运动 （Huji）保持着联系，而该组织又与基地组织关系密切。	Indian intelligence officials allege that the leader of a BNP coalition partner, Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini, maintains ties to the banned armed Islamist group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, or Huji, which in turn is allegedly linked to Al Qaeda.
它们的资产负债表上的按揭风险也较低，因为欧洲没有房利美和房地美（美国的两大准公有按揭银行，它们为美国按揭证券化推波助澜 ） 。	They also hold more low-risk mortgages on their balance sheets, in the absence of a European equivalent of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (America’s two quasi-public mortgage banks), which hoovered up securitized US mortgages.
这可以通过基于两大不同但互惠的“复兴区 ” （ reconstruction zone）的战略实现：出口导向区（ERZ）和地方生产区（LRZ ） 。	This can be achieved with a strategy based on two distinct but mutually beneficial “reconstruction zones”: an export-oriented zone (ERZ) and a local-production zone (LRZ).
在这些障碍被排除前，陷入减速的中国经济 — — 2014年增长率为7.4 % ， 是近四分之一世纪以来的最低值 — — 几乎没有希望依靠改革给自己带来需要的推力。	Until these barriers are removed, there is little hope that China’s slowing economy – which grew by 7.4% in 2014, its lowest rate in nearly a quarter-century – can rely on reform to give it the push it needs.
SDR的创立伴随着一项承诺，并写入了IMF协定章程中 ： “ 让特别提款权成为国际货币体系的主要储备资产 ” （ 第八条第7款和第二十二条 ） 。	The establishment of SDRs was accompanied by a commitment, included in the IMF Articles of Agreement, to “making the special drawing right the principal reserve asset in the international monetary system” (Article VIII, Section 7 and Article XXII).
由于油价与美元之间的负相关作用，更弱势的美元导致油价上升，进一步推高贸易赤字，从而向美元施加更加大的贬值压力。	Owing to the inverse relationship between oil prices and the dollar, the weaker dollar increases oil prices, which increases the trade deficit further, putting more downward pressure on the dollar.
犹太人也曾经是开罗、大马士革和巴格达的重要居民，如今他们也从中东各主要穆斯林地区消失了，前往以色列、欧洲和北美定居。	Jews, too – once a vital presence in cities like Cairo, Damascus, and Baghdad – have all but disappeared from the predominantly Muslim parts of the Middle East, relocating to Israel, Europe, and North America.
举个例子，一项知名研究记录了印度喀拉拉邦的手机普及如何让渔民得以利用当地市场之间价差进行套利，使其利润平均增加了8 ％ 。	For example, a well-known study has documented how the spread of mobile phones in the Indian state of Kerala enabled fishermen to arbitrage price differences across local markets, increasing their profits by 8% on average as a result.
而在最悲观的情况下，土耳其经济将陷入崩溃，从而将包括叙利亚和目前滞留土耳其的他国难民在内的大量难民送入西欧。	In the worst-case scenario, Turkey’s economy will collapse, sending huge numbers of refugees – including Syrians and others currently in Turkey, as well as Turks themselves – to Western Europe.
在国内政策方面，失败要开始得更早：从20世纪80年代的里根经济学到21世纪10年代的奥巴马医保，重大政策总是承诺过多、兑现过少，同时，根本性问题也没有得到解决。	With regard to domestic policy, the failures began even earlier: from Reaganomics in the 1980s to Obamacare in the 2010s, major policies have often overpromised and underperformed, while failing to address underlying problems.
这就是真实生活：西方男孩常见的印有梅西头像的足球T恤、俯瞰地中海的餐厅、随处可见的戴着头巾的女学生、理发店、服装店、水果铺，还有繁忙的交通 — — 其中不乏通过埃及边境的费拉德尔菲路（Philadelphi Route）的地下隧道走私而来的新车。	Barbers, clothes shops, fruit stalls. And a good deal of traffic – with new cars smuggled in through tunnels beneath the “Philadelphi Route” that runs along the Egyptian border.
对议会多数所表达的意愿进行如此冒险的赌博只会引发一场宪法危机，而上述危机只有选民通过大选或新的全民公投才能够解决。	Pursuing such a desperately risky gamble against the expressed wishes of a parliamentary majority would trigger a constitutional crisis that could be resolved only by appealing to voters – either through a general election or a new referendum.
就其本身而言，如果将关税和贸易壁垒视为短暂的谈判策略，将不会显著改变全球投资模式或全球供应链及就业结构。	On their own, tariff and trade barriers, if viewed as transitory negotiating tactics, will not significantly change global investment patterns or the structure of global supply chains and employment.
墨西哥城—即将到来的奥巴马访问古巴之行毫无疑问是一个历史时刻，它将标志着88年以来首位美国总统踏上古巴的土地。	MEXICO CITY – Barack Obama’s upcoming visit to Cuba is undoubtedly an historic moment, as it will mark the first time in 88 years that a sitting American president has set foot on the island.
虽然IMF声明预先批准的申请过程是保密的，但各国却对此将信将疑，害怕一旦走漏了风声就会被视为存在潜在经济问题。	Countries fear that by applying for pre-approval – a process that they are not confident will remain confidential, as promised – they will signal potential economic problems.
首先，世界银行拥有独一无二的地位：它可以起到国际援助体系的“平衡器”作用，帮助确保资金流向最需要的国家。	For starters, the Bank is uniquely placed to play the role of a “balancer” in the international aid system, helping to ensure that funds flow toward the countries that most need them.
期盼已久的波兰人民起义终于到来了。 这是对1980年12月雅鲁泽尔斯基宣布戒严令、取缔团结工会并将其领导人投入监狱的报复。	Here, at long last, was Poland’s long-awaited popular uprising, revenge for December 1980, when Jaruzelski declared martial law, banned Solidarity, and threw its leaders in jail.
我们暂时还不得而知，但是争论者们应该想起修西底德（Thucydides）在两千多年前的警告，持有战争必然发生的信念会成为导致战争的主要原因。	We will not know for some time, but the debaters should recall Thucydides’ warning more than two millennia ago that belief in the inevitability of conflict can become one of its main causes.
假定美国采取丹麦的全民免费教育政策，同时保持其税收-GDP之比不变，那么其财政赤字将超过GDP的6 % 。	Hypothetically, if the US adopted Denmark’s universal free education policy, but kept its tax-to-GDP ratio unchanged, its fiscal deficit would exceed 6% of GDP.
越来越多的证据表明气候变化和海平面上升、热浪、干旱和降雨强度之间的确具有某种联系，而且尽管对飓风和龙卷风的科学研究还无法得出确凿的结论，但这种情况也有可能改变。	There is growing evidence of links between climate change and sea-level rise, heat waves, droughts, and rainfall intensity, and, although scientific research on hurricanes and tornadoes is not as conclusive, that may be changing.
病态自恋者总是沉迷于暴力冲突和战争（想想林登·约翰逊和越南，或安德鲁·杰克逊和印第安人清洗运动 ） 。	Pathological narcissists have a tendency to indulge in violent conflicts and wars (think of Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam or of Andrew Jackson and the ethnic cleansing of Native Americans).
我们知道，向低碳经济的转型、赢得与贫困和疾病的全球战争、在全球范围提供高质量教育和实体基础设施需要巨大的公共和私人投资。	We know that enormous public and private investment is required for the transition toward a low-carbon economy, to win the global fight against poverty and disease, and to provide high-quality education and physical infrastructure worldwide.
如果案件必须实地考察特定目标 — — 如某栋建筑 — — 法国法官会指派一名专家前往考察，然后提交一份书面报告。	In cases where something– a building, for example – must be seen, the French judge will appoint an “expert” to go look at it and then submit a written report.
比如，为了给GAVI（疫苗联盟）提供融资，建立了国际免疫融资便利（International Finance Facility for Immunization ） 。	For example, the International Finance Facility for Immunization was created to provide financing for GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.
最近，尽管金融市场持续波动，但中国经济金融的决策部门仍放宽了宏观经济政策，这为明年落实大量制度性改革奠定了基础。 制度性改革是为了降低系统性风险，是确保中国未来可持续发展所必须做的。	China’s recent relaxation of macroeconomic policy, despite ongoing market volatility, is an important step toward breaking unnecessary barriers to implementing the reforms needed to mitigate systemic risks.
然而约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）并不认同这一观点 ， “ 将生产能力的巨大膨胀视为贫困和衰退的必然前奏是非常愚蠢的 ， ” 凯恩斯在1920年代经济繁荣转向大萧条后的1931年写到。	“It seems an extraordinary imbecility that this wonderful outburst of productive energy should be the prelude to impoverishment and depression,” Keynes wrote in 1931, after the boom years of the 1920s had given way to the Great Depression.
伦敦 — — 在2013年的一次新闻发布会上，当时刚刚继任的弗朗西斯教皇尽人皆知地表示，如果说到性取向，包括过去的同性恋行为 ， “ 我有什么资格去评判别人 ？ ”	LONDON – In a 2013 press conference, then-recently inaugurated Pope Francis famously said that, when it comes to sexual orientation, including past homosexual acts, “who am I to judge?”
因此，游说团体海鲜观察组织（Seafood Watch）最近给所有RAS水产贴上了“最佳选择”标签。	Accordingly, the advocacy organization Seafood Watch currently gives all RAS-farmed fish a “Best Choice” tag.
2010年时 — — 就在美联储宣布进行第三轮量化宽松政策之后 — — 巴西财政部长吉多·曼特加（Guido Mantega）就指责发达经济体发动了一场全球性“货币战争 ” 。	In 2010 – following the Fed’s announcement of a third round of quantitative easing – Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega accused advanced countries of waging a global “currency war.”
其中的逻辑是，这一条件将确保各国保持偿债能力，而OMT将能重塑人们对因投资者担心相关国家可能退出欧元区而崩溃的市场信心。	The logic is that conditionality will ensure that countries are solvent, while OMTs will restore trust to a market that has broken down because investors fear that the countries concerned will exit the eurozone.
但这将扼杀外部需求，破坏更广泛的经济管理，也让中国对全球经济领导地位的主张（包括人民币国际化）信誉扫地。	But that would stifle external demand, undermine economic management more broadly, and discredit the country’s claim to global economic leadership (including internationalization of the renminbi).
8月30日，国家主席习近平主持了中央全面深化改革领导小组的决定 — — 改革中国金融体系，便利绿色投资。	On August 30, President Xi Jinping presided over a decision by the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms to transform China’s financial system to facilitate green investment.
当前的外国直接投资框架 — — 由超过3000份协议交织而成的一团乱麻 — — 并不足以吸引实现2030年联合国可持续发展目标所需的投资水平。	The current FDI framework – a muddled mess of more than 3,000 agreements – is insufficient to attract the level of investment needed to meet the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for the year 2030.
如果人们有机会过上健康的生活，他们就能够受到教育，为经济做出贡献，照顾自己的家庭，形成进一步提振繁荣和发展的乘数效应。	If people are given the opportunity to lead healthy lives, they can get an education, contribute to the economy, and look after their families, generating a multiplier effect that further boosts prosperity and development.
当被问及中国为什么不澄清要求时，中方对话者有时会说这需要艰难的政治和官僚妥协，还有可能刺激国内的民族主义者。	When asked why they do not clarify their claims, my Chinese interlocutors sometimes say that to do so would require difficult political and bureaucratic compromises that would provoke domestic nationalists.
因为中华文明深深地根植在2300万不同政治信仰的台湾人的日常生活当中，即便是政府的命令也难以轻易抹去。	The Chinese culture embodied in the daily lives of 23 million Taiwanese of whatever political beliefs was not so easily eliminated by decree.
据2017年阿德尔曼信任报告（2017 Edelman Trust Barometer ） ， 全世界对现状的公共信心都出现了暴跌，原因在于人们对全球化、创新、移民、社会价值观的堕落和腐败普遍感到担忧。	According to the 2017 Edelman Trust Barometer, the public’s confidence in the status quo has collapsed worldwide, owing to widely held concerns about globalization, innovation, immigration, the erosion of social values, and corruption.
其中的逻辑看上去无懈可击，诚然，世界上400,000种植物中的绝大部分含有保护自己免遭放牧牲畜吞噬的化学防御（有毒 ） 。	The logic seems impeccable, and it is true that the vast majority of the planet’s 400,000 plant species do contain chemical defenses (poisons) to defend themselves from grazing herbivores.
他建议日本继续当前货币宽松方针 — — 可以刺激需求，同时保持一定的通胀防卫能力 — — 停止即将到来的消费税提升。	He recommends that Japan continue its current method of monetary easing – which can boost demand, while maintaining some safeguard against inflation – and postpone its forthcoming consumption-tax hike.
这样一来，中国就可以避免再次出现过去几年间的那种资产泡沫 — — 信贷快速增长，却未能支持实体经济。	That way, China can avoid the kinds of asset bubbles that swelled in the last several years, when rapid credit growth failed to support the real economy.
另一个索罗维基的例子 ： “ 风险资本家汤姆·珀金斯（Tom Perkins）和家得宝（Home Depot）联合创始人肯尼斯·兰根（Kenneth Langone）都把对富人的民粹主义抨击比作纳粹迫害犹太人 。 ”	Other examples from Surowiecki: “the venture capitalist Tom Perkins and Kenneth Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot, both compared populist attacks on the wealthy to the Nazis’ attacks on the Jews.”
厄庇墨透斯是普罗米修斯的兄弟。 反抗巨人普罗米修斯领导了 — — 也有故事说是他创造了 — — 人类。	Epimetheus was brother to Prometheus, the rebel titan who championed – and, by some accounts, created – humankind.
相反，特朗普的竞选材料提出“赤字中性的基础设施税收优惠制度 ” ， 以激励私人企业上马公路、桥梁、隧道、机场等项目。	Instead, Trump’s campaign called for a “deficit-neutral system of infrastructure tax credits” to provide incentives for private businesses to undertake projects to build roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and so forth.
在没有适当程序的情况下 — — 例如议会或内阁审查，部长和专家审核以及国内咨询 — — 财政部聚敛了更多权力，而政府治理却在下降。	In the absence of due process – such as parliamentary or cabinet scrutiny, ministerial and expert review, and domestic consultation – the finance ministry accrues more power, and governance declines.
最近，前塞内加尔总统阿卜杜拉耶·��德（Abdoulaye Wade）之子卡里姆·瓦德（Karim Wade）因涉嫌在其父总统任职期间（他在此期间担任矿产部门要职）敛财约15亿美元而被捕。	More recently, Karim Wade, the son of former Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade, was arrested on suspicion that he amassed a fortune of roughly $1.5 billion during his father’s presidency, when he held senior ministerial positions.
但由于房地产和银行信贷市场的复杂性和非竞争性，为使价格达到市场均衡水平而取消配额在目前也并非一个好的选择。	But eliminating quotas in order to allow prices to reach market-clearing levels is not an option this time, owing to the complexity and competitiveness of the real-estate and bank-credit markets.
大量有关克罗地亚串通塞尔维亚分割波斯尼亚的证据 — — 有些是连媒体都忽略的 — — 也不会呈现在世人面前。	Overwhelming proof of Croatia’s complicity with Serbia in the dismemberment of Bosnia – something the media have also ignored – would never have emerged.
一个基本因素是印度识字率上升，目前已经达到79 % ， 主要是受北方“奶牛带”诸邦 — — 印地语核心地带的改善的推动。	One basic factor is India’s rising literacy rate, which has climbed to 79%, owing largely to improvement in the “cow belt” of the northern states – the Hindi-speaking heartland.

GDP增长最大化将不再会是最重要的；相反，最重要的应该是我们想要叫做“幸福 ” 、 “康乐”或“美好生活”的事物。	Maximizing GDP growth will no longer be the top priority; rather, it should be something we might want to call “happiness,” or “well-being,” or the “good life.”
另一方面，体现错误观点者包括那些言必称“传染”和“多米诺效应”的人，他们暗示金融市场失去了理智，已成为一剂毒药，当它们受到干扰时，没有哪个国家能够幸免。	Mistaken beliefs, on the other hand, are reflected in metaphors like “contagion” and “domino effect,” which imply that financial markets become blind, virulent, and indiscriminate when they are disturbed.
在发达市场，这些瓶颈大多来自人口的下降和老化、劳动力市场僵化、不堪重负的福利国家、高昂的扭曲性税收以及政府负债。	In advanced markets, these stem largely from a declining and aging population, labor-market rigidities, an unaffordable welfare state, high and distorting taxes, and government indebtedness.
此外，尽管中国是世界上外国直接投资的主要接受国之一，但它未能将所有资本转化为经常账户逆差来为持续增长的国内投资和/或消费提供资金。	Moreover, though China is among the world’s leading recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI), it has failed to translate all that capital into a current-account deficit that would finance increased domestic investment and/or consumption.
此外，人民币对于大部分资本交易而言仍不可兑换，中国金融市场也较为原始，人民币汇率的交易波动幅度仍由货币当局每日制定。	Moreover, the renminbi remains non-convertible for most capital transactions, China’s financial markets are primitive, and trading margins for the exchange rate are still set daily by the monetary authorities.
而在尼日利亚北部恐怖组织博科圣地（Boko Haram）没完没了的袭击彰显出实施完整的安全校园计划的必要性；但这方面的资金根本无从着落。	And in northern Nigeria, countless attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram have underscored the need for a full safe-schools program; but the money to deliver it simply is not there.
从有数据的189个国家看，2015年中位通胀水平正好不到2 % ， 略低于2014年，也低于国际货币基金组织（IMF）在其4月的《世界经济展望 》 （ World Economic Outlook）中的预测。	For the 189 countries for which data are available, median inflation for 2015 is running just below 2%, slightly lower than in 2014 and, in most cases, below the International Monetary Fund’s projections in its April World Economic Outlook.
我再也想象不出会有哪次萧条能够比希腊更加“故意 ” ， 后果更加灾难性：比如，希腊年轻失业率现已超过60 % 。	I can think of no depression, ever, that has been so deliberate and had such catastrophic consequences: Greece’s rate of youth unemployment, for example, now exceeds 60%.
简言之，未来两代希腊人都将在三驾马车及其“程序 ” （ 具体的名义也许会有所不同）的永久陪伴下长大。	In short, the next two generations of Greeks will grow up with the troika and its “process” (perhaps under a different name) as a permanent fixture of life.
但特朗普更加关注安全问题，而不是委内瑞拉总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗或尼加拉瓜总统丹尼尔·奥尔特加，因此，避免美墨关系实质性破裂其实是有可能的。	But Trump cares more about security than he does about Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro or Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega, so a real rupture here may be avoided.
俄亥俄州民主党参议员谢罗德·布朗（Sherrod Brown）和路易斯安那州共和党参议员大卫·维特（David Vitter）与其他重要同事一道，长期以来一直在寻求取消这一隐性补贴。	Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, along with some important colleagues, have long sought to phase out this implicit subsidy.
伊拉克库尔德人甚至可能将其影响力扩张到库尔德人众多的叙利亚北部，从而成为比巴格达的伊拉克政府更有影响力的地区行动方。	Iraq’s Kurds may even be able to extend their influence into Kurdish-populated northern Syria, thereby becoming a more influential regional player than the Iraqi government in Baghdad.
这笔巨大的税收增加并不计入标准报税表，因为2011—2012年收入税“假期”一直被视为是定向、临时的。	This serious revenue boost was not counted in standard reports, because the payroll-tax “holiday” for 2011-2012 had always been treated legally as temporary.
比如，在希腊，旨在降低债务负担的措施实际上导致了该国背上了比2010年还要沉重的债务负担：债务-GDP比率因为财政紧缩对产出所造成的消极影响而增加。	In Greece, for example, measures intended to lower the debt burden have in fact left the country more burdened than it was in 2010: the debt-to-GDP ratio has increased, owing to the bruising impact of fiscal austerity on output.
这一新ICAO框架的目标是从2020年开始实现国际航程的“碳中性增长 ” ， 其核心是一项基于全球市场的措施（GMBM ） ， 帮助航空公司以可承受的成本将净排放限制在2020年���平。	The new ICAO framework aims for “carbon-neutral growth” in international aviation from 2020 onward, and has as its centerpiece a global market-based measure (GMBM) to help airlines affordably cap their net emissions at 2020 levels.
阿齐兹确保了赫勒德（Khaled）身居国防部长之位，还将赫勒德声名狼藉的弟弟班达尔（Bandar）召回担任沙特情报安全委员会（Intelligence Security Council）主管。	Sultan secured the defense ministry for his son Khaled, and brought back Khaled’s notorious brother, Bandar to head the Intelligence Security Council.
发自华盛顿特区 — — 反全球化政治运动的崛起以及贸易保护主义的威胁令一些人不禁猜想是否应该构建一个更强大的世界经济多边核心来减少破坏性分裂的风险。	WASHINGTON, DC – The rise of anti-globalization political movements and the threat of trade protectionism have led some people to wonder whether a stronger multilateral core for the world economy would reduce the risk of damaging fragmentation.
在梅要求举行大选之前，商界所要求的长期过渡期和保守党疑欧派所要求的立即与欧盟完全脱离之间的矛盾几乎不可调和。	Until the election was called, it seemed almost impossible to reconcile the business community’s need for a long transition period with the insistence of Conservative Euroskeptics on a complete and immediate break with the EU.
但认为如此微小的变化 — — 从12月的2.7%上升到1月的2.9 % （ 观察者认为这是季节性因素导致的偏差 ） — —就能引发股市回调，这本身就是对基本面观点的否定。	But the claim that such a slight change – from 2.7% in December to 2.9% in January (which observers view as an aberration, caused by seasonal factors) – could trigger a stock-market correction is in itself a strike against the fundamentalist view.
巴黎 — — 2003年，在雅克·希拉克总统执政期间，法国领导了反对美国入侵萨达姆·侯赛因治下伊拉克的运动。	PARIS – In 2003, France, under President Jacques Chirac, took the lead in opposing America’s planned invasion of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.
但在祖马时代，财富的集中导致了裙带式的招聘行为，基于附庸关系的政治任命（政府雇员薪金较高）以及其他形式的腐败。	But in the Zuma era, concentrated wealth led to nepotistic hiring practices, political appointments based on clientelism (owing to higher salaries for government employees), and other forms of corruption.
把选手罚出场 — — 比如足球比赛中的危险犯规情形 — — 是实实在在的惩罚，不仅惩罚个体，也惩罚了团队。	Suspending a player from the sport – as happens in soccer in the case of dangerous fouls – is a real punishment, not only for the individual but also for the team.
尽管几百年来受到了基督教和伊斯兰教的影响，但耶西迪宗教有着悠久的异教徒历史，至少可以追溯到青铜时代末期。	Although influenced over the centuries by Christianity and Islam, the Yezidi religion has ancient pagan roots that go back at least to the late Bronze Age.
银行将在星期五晚上关门，在周末期间卸下预先确定的缩水债务，然后在星期一早上重新开张，而不必（在最佳情景中）需要政府援助。	The bank would be closed on Friday evening, unburdened of pre-positioned evaporating debts over the weekend, and reopened on Monday morning, without (in the best-case scenario) needing a government bailout.
比如，尽管完全浮动的货币能带来纪律和灵活的好处，但极有可能最好的做法还是推迟完全浮动，代之以可调整 （ “ 爬行 ” ） 盯住锚货币。	For example, while a fully floating currency would create a beneficial combination of discipline and flexibility, it might best be delayed in favor of an adjustable (“crawling”) peg to some anchor currencies.
这一经济政策方针是经典的民粹主义：承诺选民不可能的东西，特别是在承诺的副作用在很久以后才会显现出来的情况下。	This approach to economic policy is classic populism: Promise voters impossible things, particularly when the negative fallout from the promises becomes apparent only well down the road.
她赢得了在东盟联合公报上的斗争，却可能失去了20年苦心经营积累下来的善意 — — 也正是它们促成了2002年11月签订的东盟-中国自由贸易协定。	It won the battle of the comminiqué, but it may have lost 20 years of painstakingly accumulated goodwill, the result of efforts such as the ASEAN-China free-trade agreement, signed in November 2002.
这类似于关于私人消费边际效应递减的观点，并且相对来说对此没有多大争议，尽管研究者们在它的规模上存在不同观点。	This is analogous to the idea of diminishing marginal private utility of private consumption, and is relatively uncontroversial, although researchers disagree on its magnitude.
20年前撰写“历史的终结”一文时，我没有料到美国的行为和错误判断竟会使反美主义成为全球政治的重要标志线。	When I wrote about the “end of history” almost twenty years ago, one thing that I did not anticipate was the degree to which American behavior and misjudgments would make anti-Americanism one of the chief fault-lines of global politics.
世界只是刚刚开始看到网络战争的影子 — — 伴随2008年格鲁吉亚常规战争的拒绝服务攻击，或者是近期对伊朗离心机的破坏。	The world is only just beginning to see glimpses of cyber war – in the denial-of-service attacks that accompanied the conventional war in Georgia in 2008, or the recent sabotage of Iranian centrifuges.
而这项研究 — — 毫不意外，来自支持英国退出的经济学家 — — 受到了其他经济学界人士的尖锐批评，认为它缺乏合理的分析基础。	And that study – produced, unsurprisingly, by Economists for Brexit – has been sharply criticized by the rest of the economic profession for lacking an appropriate analytical basis.
他们的策略选择已不再是20世纪90年代的武装动乱或21世纪最初十年的组成军事单位进行侵略，而是个人恐怖行动。	Their tactic of choice is no longer armed insurgency, as in the 1990’s, or raids by groups of militants, as in the 2000’s, but individual acts of terror.
他不仅没有保护俄罗斯的私人企业，还在囤积了大量外汇储备的情况下冻结了国内的资金流动性，导致2009年第一季度俄罗斯GDP重挫9.5 % 。	Rather than shielding Russia’s private enterprises, he engineered a domestic liquidity freeze, which led to a sharp drop in GDP of 9.5% in the first quarter of 2009, despite Russia’s huge foreign reserves.
在我们与中国行动方的会面中，我的团队和我认为该决议具有非常重大的意义 — — 它明确地提醒我们当前紧张局面的深远影响。	In our meetings with Chinese actors, my team and I found the resolution to be particularly relevant – a clear reminder of the far-reaching implications of the current tensions.
在这篇《纽约时报》评论中，以及在我的书《自由落体 》 （ Freefall）的更加详细的讨论中，我指出刺激所需要的规模将取决于它的设计和经济的条件。	In that Times commentary, and later more extensively in my book Freefall, I pointed out that the size of the stimulus that was needed would depend both on its design and economic conditions.
一旦过去的熊市被定义，就可以开始使用我的哈佛同事约翰·Y·坎贝尔（John Y. Campbell）和我于1988年开发的预测长期股票市场回报指标来评估在那些时期之前的股票估值水平了。	Once the past bear markets were identified, it was time to assess stock valuations prior to them, using an indicator that my Harvard colleague John Y. Campbell and I developed in 1988 to predict long-term stock-market returns.
作为一名前CNN记者，丽姆王妃娴静的举止和出色的外交辞令掩盖了她的过人勇气：在美军对伊拉克发动“震撼与威慑”行动前夕，在巴格达的丽姆即便在炸弹乱飞之时依然牢牢站在摄像机面前进行现场报道，并以此俘虏了阿里王子的心。	A former CNN journalist, her quiet bearing and diplomatic manner belie her courage: she captured her husband’s heart as she was reporting from Baghdad on the eve of “shock and awe,” standing firm before the cameras even as the bombs were falling.
与在欧洲的多边努力不同，二战结束后美国在亚洲建立了中心辐射型安全框架 — — 以美国为中心的双边盟友关系。	In contrast to its multilateral efforts in Europe, the US created a hub-and-spoke security framework – formed by US-centered bilateral alliances – in Asia following WWII.
眼看着本国货币近几年来戏剧性地升值，首相安倍晋三（Shinzo Abe）所领导的新政府正在采取措施改变本国货币汇率的动向 — — 并且成效显著。	Having seen its currency appreciate dramatically in recent years, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new government is taking steps to alter the country’s exchange-rate dynamic – and is succeeding.
人们一般在已经心存怨愤的情况下才会去响应武力号召 — — 尤其当他们感觉所属团体在资源和就业方面面临被歧视的状况。	People will generally respond only if they already have grievances – in particular, if they feel that their group faces discrimination in access to resources and jobs.
穆尔西敦促伊朗加入到埃及、土耳其和沙特 — — 均是逊尼派占多数的国家 — — 的行列中，敦促叙利亚实现政治转型（对于这一角色，叙利亚反对派在伊朗说不之前便予以了否定 ） 。	Moreover, Morsi urged Iran to join Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia – all Sunni-majority countries – in pressing for political transition in Syria (a role that the Syrian opposition rejected before Iran could even say no).
我们希望更迅速、更果断、更大手笔地行动 — — 不仅在危机尖锐的时期，也通过着重于冲突预防和冲突后管理实现。	We want to act sooner, more decisively, and in a more substantial manner – not just when crises become acute, but also by focusing on conflict prevention and post-conflict management.
“不可信的精英”形象是民粹主义者的理想饲料，他们声称全球化赋予富人和权力阶层的金钱和权力比以往任何时候都多。	The image of “untrustworthy elites” is ideal fodder for populists, who claim that globalization has given the wealthy and powerful more money and power than ever.
相反，领导人未能汲取大萧条的教训，更不用说为此采取相应的预防对策可能引发未来几十年一系列新的经济和其他危机。	On the contrary, leaders’ failure to discern, much less act on, the lessons of the Great Recession may open the way for a series of fresh crises, economic and otherwise, in the coming decades.
认知科学研究第一次在道德哲学引发而来的理论观点基础之上使得解决有关道德起源和性质等古老的争论成为可能。	For the first time, research in the cognitive sciences, building on theoretical arguments emerging from moral philosophy, has made it possible to resolve the ancient dispute about the origin and nature of morality.
当心系天下的公民仅仅因为行动活跃就会被送入监狱时，当对监控的担忧导致群体消极时，单一问题政治就不是制胜策略。	When simply taking up the activism of a concerned citizen can land you in jail and fear of surveillance encourages mass passivity, single-issue politics is not a winning strategy.
书中传递的信息 — — 呼吁解决日益加剧的不平等性以及要求更强的经济增长 — — 造成了巨大的政治影响。	The book’s message – a call to address rising inequality and a plea for stronger economic growth – has strong policy implications.
除此之外，这些参与者还想方设法要去撤销或严重削弱该机构，并出于这一目的向众议院金融服务委员会成员捐赠了大量的资金。	These players, among others, have worked hard to abolish or severely curtail the agency, donating a great deal of money to members of the House Financial Services Committee for the same end.
关键动作发生在2012年6月。 当是时，完全由穆巴拉克时代遗老组成的最高法院以似是而非的托辞宣布议会选举结果无效。	The key action came in June 2012, when the Supreme Court, staffed entirely with Mubarak-era holdovers, nullified the results of the parliamentary elections on specious grounds.
GMF的《跨大西洋趋势 》 （ Transatlantic Trends ）调查的最重要的发现是，当人们获得最基本的事实时，对移民的担忧就会迅速减少。	The most important finding of the GMF’s Transatlantic Trends survey is that concern about immigrants falls sharply when people are given even the most basic facts.
即便普京确实希望与西方展开对话，人们也无法忽视本月在英格兰索尔兹伯里发生的前俄罗斯双面特工谢尔盖·斯克里帕尔及其女儿遭受的神经毒剂攻击事件。	Even if Putin did want to open a dialogue with the West, one cannot ignore the nerve-agent attack on former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, this month.
随着越来越频繁的极端天气改变迁移模式，流离失所者（已经达到有史以来创纪录的高位）的数量和对基本资源（如水、粮食和能源）的争夺将持续增加。	As increasingly extreme weather reshapes migration patterns, the number of displaced people (already at record highs worldwide) will rise, and competition for essential resources (such as water, food, and energy) will increase.
毕竟，是全球化带来了法国人所谓的“光辉的三十年 ” （ Les Trente Glorieuses ） — —二战结束后生活水平快速提高的三十年。	It was globalization, after all, that created what in France became known as Les Trente Glorieuses – the 30 glorious years of rapidly rising living standards following the end of WWII.
如果希腊的伙伴国一遇到没有勇气作出决定的情况就中断讨论、要求用一周时间让人民来做决定，情况会怎么样？	What would happen if Greece’s partners, each time they confronted a decision that they lacked the courage to make, broke off discussions and demanded a week to allow the people to decide?
达累斯萨拉姆—三年前，世界领导人做出了全球公共卫生史上最宏大之一的目标承诺：到2030年实现全民健康覆盖。	DAR ES SALAAM – It has been three years since world leaders committed to one of the boldest goals ever set in global public health: achieving universal health coverage by 2030.
美联储应该暂停升息的另一个原因是新兴市场（特别是中国）的金融动荡可能给全球经济造成重大冲击，美国经济也将受到明显影响。	Another reason why the Fed should postpone a rate hike is that financial turmoil in emerging markets, particularly China, could have a substantial impact on the global economy, with some clear implications for the US economy.
从英国投票“脱离”欧盟，到唐纳德·特朗普被提名为共和党美国总统候选人，更不用说日益频繁的恐怖袭击，西方民主国家发生问题的证据不胜枚举。	Between the British vote to “Brexit” the European Union and the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for the US presidency, not to mention increasingly frequent terrorist attacks, they have plenty of evidence.
此外，奥巴马最近宣布成立建设美国交通投资中心（Build America Transportation Investment Center ） ， 为寻求私人部门合作以支持交通基础设施的州和地方官员提供技术援助。	Moreover, Obama recently announced the creation of the Build America Transportation Investment Center to provide technical assistance to state and local officials seeking private-sector partners to support transport infrastructure.
许多原本的亲密盟友本来就怀疑将目光转向亚洲的美国是否有为它们撑腰的能力和意愿，并因此日愈疏远，如今奥巴马认为美国不应关注中东的说法更是令它们感到震惊。	Add to that the alienation of close allies, many of which doubt the ability and willingness of an Asia-fixated US to stand by them, and Obama’s suggestion that the US should not be focused on the Middle East is shocking.
虽然菲律宾在新政府管理团队的领导下重新向商业世界开放还不到一年时间，而一切都进展得很顺利 — — 也必将变得日益富强。	The Philippines reopened for business under new management only a little more than a year ago. It is faring very well – and is set to become increasingly profitable.
如果我们真的想要获取抗冲击能力，就必须推动严峻的系统性变革以解决生产和消费能源以及为经济提供资金的问题。	If we are serious about building resilience, we need to press ahead with tough systemic changes that address how we produce and consume energy and finance our economies.
21世纪新法国社会契约必须以三大支柱为基础，首先是强有力的社会保障政策，上述政策将使经济更有活力，劳动力市场更加灵活。	A new French social contract for the twenty-first century must rest on three pillars, starting with strong social-security policies, which will allow for improved labor-market flexibility and greater economic dynamism.
此外，经济增长可以更好地提供地球上绝大多数人所需或想要的所有重要事项：健康，教育，安全和移动性。 无论是在国家内部还是之间，生活满意度都会随着收入的增加而提升。	Moreover, economic growth delivers improved access to all the vital things that most people on the planet demand or want: health, education, security, and mobility. Both within and between countries, life satisfaction increases with higher incomes.
还有最后一个理由，那就是从长远来看，组织捐献者或其后裔可以从他们为之做出贡献的技术进步中获得好处，既然如此，有什么必要给予他们经济上的补偿？	Finally, why should tissue donors be entitled to compensation, as they or their progeny may benefit in the long run from the technological advances to which they contribute?
第一次，G - 20 这个世界上20个主要的经济体，为了找到全球金融和经济危机的解决方案，在华盛顿特区聚到了一起。	For the first time, the G-20, the world’s 20 leading economies, came together in Washington, D.C., to find an answer to the global financial and economic crisis.
图斯克还在最近一次于布拉迪斯拉发召开的非正式欧洲理事会峰会上重申了这一立场 — — 此次峰会也是首次不包括英国的一届 — — 指出“赋予欧盟机构新的权力并不是合理的药方 ” 。	Tusk reiterated this position just before the recent informal European Council summit in Bratislava – the first not to include the United Kingdom – declaring that “giving new powers to European institutions is not the desired recipe.”
在安全方面，我们需要确保我们不是像过去那样坐在一条缓慢移动的运河驳船上，而8:15抵达曼彻斯特的火车在我们身边呼啸而过。	In terms of security, we need to ensure we aren’t sitting, as it were, on a slow-moving canal barge while the 8:15 to Manchester flashes past.
这样，他们就不必将全部任期用于争取连任，从而有时间和政治空间去考虑复杂结构性变化的细节，制定刺激经济潜在增长的政策。	Instead of spending their entire term campaigning for reelection, policymakers would have the time and political space to consider the nuances of complex structural challenges and formulate policies that boost the economy’s potential growth.
1991年苏联解体后，俄罗斯总统叶利钦显然忘了把它要回，于是乌克兰拥有了这块拥有两百万居民、其中近60%认为自己是俄罗斯人的领土。	After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russian President Boris Yeltsin apparently forgot to claim it back, so Ukraine kept a territory in which nearly 60% of the two million inhabitants identify as Russians.
在2月份 伦敦的会议上，国际出资者认识到教育对难民的重要性，承诺到2017年底让所有叙利亚难民儿童上学。	At a meeting in London in February, international donors recognized the importance of education for refugees, promising to get all of Syria’s refugee children into school by the end of 2017.
正因如此，土耳其外交就成了需要准确调校的平衡行动，不断在中东问题上接近欧洲立场的同时也希望与美国保持密切的关系。	Turkish diplomacy has thus become a well-calibrated balancing act, moving closer to European positions in the Middle East, but eager to maintain close relations with the US.
在2016年脱欧公投之前，我从老鹰乐队1976年的热门单曲《加州旅馆》中借用了这句歌词作为反对英国退出欧盟的一个论点。	Prior to the 2016 Brexit referendum, I borrowed this line from the Eagles’ 1976 hit “Hotel California” as an argument against Britain exiting the European Union.
根据国际货币基金组织（IMF）的数据，产出缺口 — — 实际和潜在GDP之间的差额 — — 从2011年的-3.6%收窄至2013年的-0.9 % 。	According to the International Monetary Fund, the output gap – the difference between actual and potential GDP – narrowed from -3.6% in 2011 to -0.9% in 2013.
无论如何，出口只占到了整个欧盟区十万亿欧元总规模的1/5，因此也不大可能在国内需求依旧疲软的情况下带动强劲增长。	In any case, with exports accounting for only one-fifth of the eurozone’s €10 trillion economy, they are unlikely to spur a strong recovery while domestic demand remains weak.
在2015年10月习近平主席对英国进行国事访问期间，中国选择伦敦发行其第一宗海外人民币主权债务，这不是巧合。	It was no coincidence that during President Xi Jinping’s state visit to the United Kingdom in October 2015, China chose London to issue its first overseas renminbi sovereign debt.
他说 ： “ 我发现难以想象他们会像爷们一样采取被他们拖延的动作 — — 实质债务重组，这将给希腊、希腊债权人和官方自助者造成了极其巨大的代价 。 ”	As he put it, “I find it hard to imagine they will now man up to the proposition that they delayed – at appalling cost to Greece, its creditors, and its official-sector sponsors – an essential debt restructuring.”
但它 — — 以及2月实施的预算立法 — — 也隐含了两个帮助州和地方政府解决美国后进群体的需要的计划。	Yet, hidden within it – and within budget legislation enacted in February – are two promising programs for helping state and local governments address the needs of disadvantaged Americans.
简言之，面临当前塞缪尔·亨廷顿（Samuel P. Huntington）所谓的民主化的“第三波”消退的情况，我们应该关注自由民主所面临的多重挑战。	In short, we should be concerned about the multiple challenges to liberal democracy during the current setback to what Samuel P. Huntington called the “third wave” of democratization.
开普敦—让我们的孩子和孩子的孩子在一个免受小儿麻痹症和其他可预防疾病困扰的世界中成长，这是我们所有人共同的梦想。	CAPE TOWN – A world in which our children and their children grow up free from the threat of polio and other preventable diseases is a dream that everyone shares.
他们大多是国际关系专家，从经济竞争力角度检视地缘政治，将全球秩序想象为一个跷跷板，一方的崛起必然意味着另一方的衰落。	Most are international-relations experts who, viewing geopolitics through the lens of economic competitiveness, imagine the global order as a seesaw, in which one player’s rise necessarily implies another’s fall.
解决法国暴乱下面隐藏的问题需要的是时间、耐心、尊重、和以社区为基础的社会警察活动，此外无庸讳言还需要大笔的资金。	Solving the problems underlying the French revolt will require time, discretion, mutual respect, community-based social and police work – rather than a centralized, repressive approach – and a lot of money.
事实上，无条件基本收入的理念在历史上已经重复出现过数次 — — 最早始于十八世纪的托马斯·潘恩（Thomas Paine ） 。	Indeed, the idea of a UBI has made recurrent appearances in history – starting with Thomas Paine in the eighteenth century.
魔鬼没有任何道德义务，因此也根本不可能承担责任，而更重要的是，把某个人划定为魔鬼就彻底排除了改造的可能性。	A monster has no moral responsibility and so cannot be held accountable; but even more seriously, designating someone a monster closes the door to possible rehabilitation.
叶利钦没有让俄罗斯陷入一盘散沙，也不愿把它带回到以前的独裁状态，他敞开大门，等待那个领袖有一天出现。	By not permitting Russia to disintegrate into anarchy or leading it back to authoritarianism, Yeltsin kept the way open for such a leader to one day emerge.
若是如此，国家就有可能成为福利磁铁，吸引远大于经济上合理数量的移民，因为新来者除了工资，还能获得以公共转移支付为形式的移民津贴。	In such cases, countries can act as welfare magnets, attracting many more migrants than would be economically advisable, because the newcomers receive, in addition to their wages, a migration grant in the form of public transfers.
从环境角度来看，这个整合市场将可以节省约2300万吨燃油 — — 大约相当于英国境内所有柴油车的年消耗量。	From an environmental perspective, an integrated market would save around 23 million tons of fuel oil – roughly the equivalent of the United Kingdom’s annual fuel consumption by diesel vehicles.
正如尼利所描述的，巴勒斯坦人“有权在以色列内部任何地方定居，正如犹太人有权在巴勒斯坦国领土内任何地方定居。	As Nieli describes it, Palestinians “would have the right to settle anywhere within Israel just as Jews would have the right to settle anywhere within the territory of the Palestinian state.
而与这位前重庆市市委书记一同陨落的则是一个经久不衰的政治神话，认为中国共产党的统治是构建于精英政治之上的。	One enduring political myth that went down with Bo, the former Communist Party boss of Chongqing municipality, is the notion that the Party’s rule is based on meritocracy.
但她还指出了“具有共同利益的重要领域 ” ， 认为“如果我们想修正、治理或解决21世纪最紧迫的问题，印度、中国和美国就必须合作 … … 共事 ” 。	Yet she also pointed to “significant areas of common interest,” arguing that, “if we want to address, manage, or solve some of the most pressing issues of the twenty-first century, India, China, and the US will have to coordinate our…efforts.”
杠杆率最高的美国银行是摩根士丹利，其股本率还不足4 % ， 也就是说，其资产负债表上有96%左右来自债务。	The most leveraged big US bank, Morgan Stanley, has less than 4% equity, meaning that 96% of its balance sheet is some form of debt.
雪上加霜的是，在出外勤时遭到攻击的外国记者，常常会发现自己成为应不应该让女性负责报道某些新闻的争论的核心。	As if that were not enough pressure, female foreign correspondents who are assaulted in the field often find themselves at the center of debates about whether women should be deployed on certain stories at all.
更广泛地说，欧洲需要一个新马歇尔计划，该计划应该是自我融资而不是由美国出资，以刺激经济增长和生产率。	More broadly, Europe needs a new Marshall Plan, this time self-financed, rather than funded by the Americans, to kick-start economic growth and boost productivity.
在阿尔巴尼亚叛军科索沃解放军（UCK）成立之后，米洛舍维奇发起了一场暴力行动，全力驱赶科索沃的阿尔巴尼亚人。	After the rise of an Albanian insurgency, the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK), Milosevic launched a violent, all-out campaign to expel Kosovo’s Albanians.
如今，在我们眼前崩溃掉的是“轻监管”体制，在该体制盛行时期，把自己包装成“新工党”的那个政党接受了大市场模式，尤其是大范围地放松了对金融市场的监管。	Today, the equivalent collapse has been of the “regulation-lite” regime in which a party that styled itself as “New Labour” accepted a powerful role for markets – particularly for largely deregulated financial markets.
尽管北美汽车业所用的40种塑料都可以循环利用，但分离和清洁塑料的需要导致循环利用的成本比使用全新塑料树脂更高。	Although all 40 kinds of plastics used in a North American automobile can be recycled, the need to separate and clean them makes using them more expensive than using virgin plastic resins.
AMR评估认为，到2050年，每年将有一千万人的死亡可以归因于抗药性传染病，其中抗药性结核菌株要占四分之一。	The Review on AMR concluded that ten million annual deaths will be attributable to drug-resistant infections by 2050, and that drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis could cause one-quarter of them.
相反，恐怖主义和反恐怖主义带来的“双重恐怖”将公众的注意力从那些（就像我们部分人仍然记得的那样）产生恐怖主义的问题上引开。	On the contrary, the “double terror” induced by terrorism and counter-terrorism distracts public attention from those problems that, as some of us still remember, produced terrorism.
说来凑巧，像肯尼思·罗格夫、拉里·萨默斯和彼得·沙德这样的著名观察家认为美国甚至应逐步淘汰100美元的钞票。	As it happens, such prominent observers as Kenneth Rogoff, Larry Summers, and Peter Sands think the US should even phase out $100 bills, too.
而他的行政部门又进一步强调了独立司法机构的重要性，因为在未来几年，这将是地方，州和联邦政府实体之间鏖战的战场。	And his administration has only further highlighted the importance of an independent judiciary, where the coming years’ battles among local, state, and federal government entities will be fought.
它大部分是犹太人组成。 尽管如此，一个年轻的阿拉伯专业人士阶层正走出大学不无困难地并且进入民间社会的中心。	It is mostly Jewish, though a young Arab professional class is now coming out of the universities and making its way – with difficulties – into the heartland of civil society.
这400亿美元看起来似乎是一大笔钱，但请考虑以下事实：世界上最富有的80人净财富高达2万亿美元左右。	That $40 billion might seem like a lot of money, but consider this: The world’s richest 80 people have an estimated net worth of around $2 trillion dollars.
尽管只有3—4%的选民承认改变了退欧的主意，但绝大部分人都希望能保留大部分自由贸易、便利旅行、移民劳工以及强大的环境、消费和卫生监管的好处。	While only 3-4% of voters admit to changing their minds about Brexit, large majorities want to keep most of the benefits of free trade, easy travel, immigrant labor, and strong environmental, consumer, and health regulation.
在短期未来，人民币还将继续升值，这是强劲的经济基本面决定的，但短期资本流的内在不稳定性将会导致人民币汇率更加波动。	The RMB will continue to appreciate in the near future, owing to strong economic fundamentals, but the inherent instability of short-term capital flows will make its exchange rate more volatile.
伊拉克的未来（如果它还有的话）将会首先有赖于伊拉克的什叶派、逊尼派和库尔德人；其次，还要依靠其邻国、它们的利益和风险计算。	Iraq’s future, if it still has any, will depend first and foremost on Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds, and, secondly, on Iraq’s neighbors and their interests and risk calculations.
但是精英大学（和商学院）对太子党的优惠待遇具有真实的社会成本，因为这些学校的招生名额是一场零和游戏。	But preferential treatment for princelings at elite universities (and business schools) has real social costs, because admission to these institutions is zero-sum.
土地所有权 — — 无论是已婚妇女的共有权还是单身户主女性的独立所有权 — — 不仅可以提高经济安全性和生产力，而且可以有助于获得传统金融服务。	Ownership of land – whether co-ownership, for a married woman, or sole ownership, for a single female head of household – not only improves economic security and productivity, but also boosts access to traditional finance.
在构成私人需求的所有元素都溃不成军的时刻，来自加大政府开支和降低税收的推动政策成功阻止了全球经济自由落体，并由此创造了复苏的基础。	At a time when every component of private demand was collapsing, the boost from higher government spending and lower taxes stopped the global economy’s free-fall and created the basis for recovery.
即使特朗普当选总统，其禁止穆斯林入境和要求墨西哥出钱修围墙阻止移民的提案也不太可能通过宪法或政治审核。	Trump’s proposal to bar Muslims from entering the US and his demands that Mexico pay for a wall to stop migration would be unlikely to pass constitutional or political muster were he elected President.
中国确实在重新装备它的军事力量，甚至进入了太空军备竞赛，但是他们发展的步伐和所占的比例是与他们所取得的经济上的成功是相称的。	To be sure, the Chinese are indeed rearming – and even entering the military space race – but they are doing so at a pace and to a proportion that reflects their new economic prosperity.
尽管失去了议会中的多数席位，但塔拉特仍然领导着土耳其塞浦路斯政府，而且仍将继续代表北方领导谈判的进程。	While he has lost his parliamentary majority, Talat is still head of the Turkish Cypriot administration and will continue to lead negotiations on behalf of the north.
毕竟，政府对这一框架的承诺对于确保12月的巴黎协议能够让全球气温升温幅度限制在前工业化水平以上2℃之内至关重要。	Governments’ commitment to such a framework, after all, is vital to ensure that the agreement to be signed in Paris in December will keep global temperatures from rising more than 2º Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
如果美国和中国能够在危机当中就这些事宜达成一致，它们将为明年在哥本哈根举行的气候变化谈判铺平成功之路。	If the US and China can find agreement on these issues in the midst of crisis, they will pave the way for success when climate negotiators meet again next year in Copenhagen.
而即使是希腊选民掷地有声的“不 ” ， 也无法增强希腊政府的谈判立场。 原因很简单：希腊退出已不再被认为是欧元稳定性的威胁。	Even the resounding “no” delivered by Greek voters could not strengthen the government’s negotiating position, for a simple reason: Grexit is no longer considered a threat to the euro’s stability.
事实上，大部分国家要么追求固定汇率，要么追求汇率目标，要么采取管理浮动，顾名思义，这些做法都包含买卖外汇以缓和或消除汇率波动。	Indeed, a majority of countries pursue either fixed exchange rates, exchange-rate targets, or managed floating, all of which by definition entail buying and selling foreign exchange to moderate or eliminate exchange-rate fluctuations.
发自米兰 — — 在持续了两年的游移不定以及多种有条件承诺的共同作用之下，欧元区的系统性风险终于开始有所降低。	MILAN – Last summer, after two years of growing uncertainty, systemic risk in the eurozone finally began to wane, as conditional commitments came together.
与此同时，政治建制派越来越脱离群众，一如两次大战期间的欧洲 — — 当时，这导致了法西斯主义和民粹主义极权统治的兴起。	At the same time, its political establishment has become increasingly disconnected from the public, much as it did in interwar Europe – a development that fueled the rise of fascism and populist authoritarianism.
由于全球化和新通信技术，所有这些人都会为标准化的生活（可能略有差异）而奋斗，这会导致全球生态系统的过渡扩张。	All of them, thanks to globalization and new communication technologies, will strive for the same standard of living, give or take, which will necessarily lead to an overstretched global ecosystem.
在菲律宾问题上，解决方法很复杂，因为这些恐怖分子与不稳定的穆斯林叛军结合一体，而西方与穆斯林叛军并不敌对。	In the Philippines, the diagnosis is complicated by the fact that terrorists are embedded in a volatile Muslim insurgency with which the West has no quarrel.
但当有人提醒我们别人在决定我们的生活时，我们又变得异常愤怒，称之为“令人毛骨悚然”并违反我们的自由意志。	But, when reminded of how others are shaping our lives, we become indignant, calling it “creepy” and a violation of our free will.
随着奥斯陆为了发展的教育峰会（Oslo Summit on Education for Development）的临近，我坚持固守我的承诺 — — 确保每一个巴基斯坦儿童获得高质量教育的权利，特别是女孩，她们长期面临大量教育阻碍。	As the Oslo Summit on Education for Development approaches, I remain firm in my commitment to securing the right to a high-quality education for every child in Pakistan – especially for girls, who have long faced high barriers to education.
它旗下的站点 — — 其中六个由比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会出资，前三年提供730万美元初始资金 — — 刚刚建立。	The sites – six of which are being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through an initial $73 million grant for the first three years – are just being established.
当然，虔诚的穆斯林自有自己的零点：公元610年，即天使加百利向先知穆罕默德传授古兰经第一首诗的时刻。	Devout Muslims, of course, have their own zero point: the year 610, when the Angel Gabriel revealed the Koran’s first verse to the Prophet Muhammad.
事实上，对债务合同的微调留下了许多没有解决的关键问题，在某些方面加深了当前系统的不足之处，甚至让事情变得更糟。	In fact, the focus on fine-tuning debt contracts leaves many critical issues unresolved, and in some ways bakes in the current system’s deficiencies – or even makes matters worse.
如果选举波席卷全美，就连亚利桑那州参议员约翰·麦凯恩等席位依然安全的共和党参议员也有可能难逃���推翻的厄运。	If the US has a wave election, even Republican Senators whose seats are still considered safe, such as Arizona Senator John McCain, could be toppled.
但是银行获利和大众痛苦的对比引发政治辩论，政府需要解释，在直升机撒钱时，为什么是仅仅是他们的朋友—银行站在飞机下方呢？	But the contrast between bank profitability and the woes of everyone else turns up the political heat on the central banks, which have to explain why it is only their “friends,” the banks, who are standing under the helicopter when it drops money.
在数字时代取得领先可能需要诸如首席数字官、首席分析官或首席数据官之类的新角色，尽管目前已经采取这一做法的公司相对较少。	Leading in the Digital Age may require creating new roles such as Chief Digital Officer, Chief Analytics Officer, or Chief Data Officer, though relatively few companies so far have taken such steps.
美国长期利率的上升 — — 从5月低点1.6%升至目前高点2.9%以上 — — 是因为市场担心美联储会过早、过急的逐渐退出QE以及围绕伯南克继任者的不确定性。	The rise in US long-term interest rates – from a low of 1.6% in May to recent peaks above 2.9% – has been driven by market fears that the Fed will taper QE too soon and too fast, and by the uncertainty surrounding Bernanke’s successor.
在二战时期，你可以在工会联盟的制造企业中保全一份蓝领工作，或辛苦爬至管理机构最高层，享受良好的职业保障，相对丰厚的薪酬，以及长期稳定的职业发展生涯。	In the generation after World War II, you could secure a blue-collar unionized manufacturing job or climb to the top of a white collar bureaucracy that offered job security, relatively high salaries, and long, stable career ladders.
鲸鱼不能被少受痛苦地杀死，因此它们体型太庞大。 即便用带炸药的捕鲸叉，也很难击中鲸鱼身体的正确部位。	Whales cannot be humanely killed – they are too large, and even with an explosive harpoon, it is difficult to hit the whale in the right spot.
自沃森和克里克于1953年发现DNA结构以来，人们识别了大量的遗传学数据，涌现了超乎想象的科学组织形式和工作模式。	Since James D. Watson and Francis Crick uncovered DNA’s structure in 1953, a massive amount of available genetic data has been identified, and novel forms of scientific organization and modes of working have emerged.
哀伤的女高音吟唱着大提琴演奏的挽歌，在歌曲和静默之间徘徊，恍然间，记忆在星期一早晨回到了我身上。 这是法国议会竞选第二轮结束后的那天。	In a plaintive soprano accompanied by a cello’s lament, lingering between song and silence, the memory came back to me on Monday morning, the day after the second round of France’s parliamentary election.
但是，通过应用基于证据的医学（evidence-based medicine，EBM）提高质量的做法有可能忽视我们所知道的的人类认知和专业知识，并且常常不利于医生的专业判断所起到的关键作用。	However, efforts to raise quality through the application of evidence-based medicine (EBM) risk ignoring what we know about human cognition and expertise, and may undermine the vital role played by a physician’s expert judgment.
叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德不是在为某个伊斯兰教派而战（他属于阿拉维派 ） ， 而是在为自己的生存而战。	Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad is not fighting for a particular sect of Islam (the Alawites in his case), but for his survival.
首先，尽管发表了声明，但尚不清楚金正恩是否同意“完全、可核查及不可逆转地（CVID）废除”朝鲜的核武计划。	First, despite Kim’s declaration, it remains unclear whether he is agreeing to “complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement” (CVID) of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
然而9·11事件后大多数伊斯兰恐怖极端主义的受害者 — — 往往遭到自杀式的卑劣袭击 — — 都是伊拉克，巴基斯坦或者其他国家的穆斯林。	Yet, since 9/11, most victims of Islamist-inspired terrorist extremism – often in the vile form of suicide attacks – have been Muslims, in Iraq, Pakistan, and elsewhere. Terrorist groups have to resort to organized crime to fund themselves.
可以肯定的是，那种只为自己吹捧谋利的民粹主义 — — 如斯大林主义者或新左派的所作所为 — — 只能产生低劣的艺术。	To be sure, simply championing populism for its own sake – a Stalinist or New Left reflex – makes for bad art.
简言之，哈梅内伊不会容忍自身权力的削弱，并且决意避免与前任总统、特别是艾哈迈迪内贾德之间的矛盾再次产生。	Simply put, Khamenei will not tolerate any diminution of his power, and he is determined to avoid the type of friction that has characterized his relationships with previous presidents, particularly Ahmadinejad.
软力量利用文化和价值的吸引力来增强一国的力量，而锐实力则可以帮助独裁政权去压制国内各界的行为并操纵海外的舆论。	Whereas soft power harnesses the allure of culture and values to augment a country’s strength, sharp power helps authoritarian regimes compel behavior at home and manipulate opinion abroad.
委员会必须执行新的碳氢化合物法律，确保伊拉克的各个集团能对该国的石油财富利益均沾，石油出口占到了伊拉克总出口收入的97%以上。	The committee must enact a new hydrocarbon law that guarantees each of Iraq’s factions a fair share of the country’s oil wealth, which accounts for 97% of total export revenue.
这种说法挑战了“华盛顿共识 ” ， 该共识宣称只有私有化、解除劳动力市场管制、实现金融自由化、国际经济融合和建立在低通胀基础上的宏观经济稳定才是实现经济发展的唯一出路。	This challenges the Washington Consensus, with its one-size-fits-all formula of privatization, deregulated labor markets, financial liberalization, international economic integration, and macroeconomic stability based on low inflation.
但是，至少到目前为止，安倍似乎没有这样做的意愿（尽管他可能与地方党组织领导人达成幕后交易，提拔更多女性 ） 。	But, at least so far, Abe seems to lack the will to do so (though he may choose to work with local party bosses behind the scenes to bring in more women).
同样，无法就就职仪式与反对派达成任何协议¾于是就上演了议员们在议会大打出手，而卡尔德龙则被从后门悄悄引入、匆匆完成就职仪式这样尴尬、混乱的一幕。	Similarly, no deal with the opposition was possible regarding the inauguration ceremony – thus the chaotic, depressing scenes of congressmen fighting it out in their chamber, while Calderón was ushered in through the back door for a rushed ceremony.
人们总把它们视为“临时真相 ” — —也就是说，可能后来会被证伪 — — 而不是成为一种完全被接受的教条。	It is always regarded as provisional – that is, subject to later falsification – rather than becoming a fully accepted dogma.
但即使是被经常提及的孟加拉国，科学家们今年刚刚告诉我们，该国的面积每年增长二十平方公里，这是因为河流淤积超过了海平面的上升。	But even for oft-cited Bangladesh, scientists just this year showed that the country grows by 20 square kilometers each year, because river sedimentation win out over rising sea levels.
这一趋势在校园餐领域正在发生逆转，这要归因于立法创新，比如允许优先考虑（不能超过10 % ） 本地产品。	This trend is now being reversed in school food, thanks to legislative innovations such as allowing a preference (of up to about 10%) for locally grown products.
在美国施加新关税的情况下，可以预计中国会通过减少国债采购来进行应对，这也进一步强化了该国在过去三年以来推行的去美元资产多元化战略。	In the event of new US tariffs, it seems reasonable to expect China to respond by reducing such purchases, reinforcing a strategy of asset diversification away from US dollar-based assets that has been under way for the past three years.
这能让乌克兰经济保持正常运转，即使发生政治动荡；并且也向乌克兰人传递了信号，欧盟和美国 — — 不管是政府还是私人投资者 — — 看好乌克兰。	This would keep the economy running, despite the political turmoil, and it would signal to Ukrainians that the EU and the US – governments and private investors alike – are committed to them.
例如民主党总统候选人希拉里·克林顿就提议 — — 副总统拜登也对此表示支持 — — 运用资本利得税来鼓励股东更长久地持有手中的股票。	Consider Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s proposal – which Vice President Joe Biden has endorsed – to use the capital gains tax to encourage shareowners to hold on to their stock for a longer time.
现有经济理论对于如何实现收入和生产率增长的良性循环（这是建设有活力而繁荣昌盛的城市群的关键）几乎没有指导作用。	Current economic theory gives little guidance on how to achieve the virtuous circle of rising income and rising productivity that is vital to dynamic and prosperous cities.
IMF在2002年提出了一套机制；但是，在投资者的联合游说下，这一机制受到了抵制，取而代之的是债务契约中的集体行动条款（CAC ） 。	The IMF proposed one in 2002; but, in the face of concerted lobbying by investors, the scheme was rebuffed and instead an agreement was reached to use collective action clauses (CACs) in debt contracts.
这样的过度简化对于中国而言并不准确，正如美国虽然是特朗普当选，但其实希拉里·克林顿赢得的民众选票更多，又如英国虽然公投脱欧通过，但其实还有很多人想留在欧盟，他们仅仅是以最薄弱的劣势败北而已。	Such an oversimplification is no more accurate for China than it would be for the US, where Hillary Clinton won the popular vote over Trump, or the UK, where those who wanted to remain in the EU lost the Brexit referendum by the slimmest of margins.
如果吸纳美元还不足以遏制升值的趋势，那么新兴国家的监管者将竖立起其他一系列政策屏障以阻止外来资金涌入。	If buying dollars is not sufficient to stem the appreciation tide, regulators in emerging economies will erect an array of other barriers to keep money out.
应对气候变化的第二个措施称为“适应 ” ， 要求我们为正在发生的气候变化以及未来年间要发生的更大的气候变化做好准备。	The second response to climate change, called “adaptation,” requires that we ready ourselves for the climate change now underway and the increased climate change to come in future years.
一些经济指数，比如失业率或者或者通胀数据，事实上会对中央银行产生直接的重要影响，因为这些与他们的政策目标直接相关，也拥有相当可以预测的效应。	Some economic indicators, such as unemployment or inflation data, are indeed immediately important for central banks, because they may directly concern their mandates, and therefore have rather predictable effects.
这番话概括了他在第一个任期中所采取的“参与”外交政策 — — 这一方针尽管存在一些缺陷，但优点也很多。	This statement encapsulated the foreign policy of “engagement” that he endorsed during his first term – an approach that, despite some shortcomings, has a lot of merit.
理论上，它们被允许作为影响力投资者，在于它们的规定职责相符的项目中做一些“项目相关投资 ” ； 但是，在实践中，它们面临着严格的信托规则，使它们根本不愿意去做这样的投资。	They are, in theory, allowed to act as impact investors to make “program-related investments” in projects consistent with their stated missions; in practice, however, they face strict fiduciary rules that make them reluctant to do so.
巴西利亚—在过去的一年中，大型新兴经济体纷纷因发达国家危机引起欧洲的衰退和美国复苏乏力而遭受重创，特别是上半年。	BRASILIA – Large emerging economies were hit hard in the past year – particularly in the first half – by the crisis in developed countries, with Europe in recession and the United States staging only a meager recovery.
但是北约这一企图的明显程度还存在争议：当时北约内部没有任何主要大国要求让乌克兰加入，乌克兰领导人对此也没有要求。	But just how obvious this was is open to debate: no major power within NATO was calling for Ukraine’s membership, and Ukraine’s leaders were not asking for it.
2020年，中国的产出预计将超过美国，但几十年的僵化人口控制政策会破坏其长期增长，这意味着美国经济仍是三强中最有活力的。	While China is expected to overtake the US in terms of output by 2020, decades of rigid population-control measures will weaken growth in the longer run, leaving the US economy as the most dynamic of the three.
坎布里奇—7月23日，国际货币基金组织（IMF）西半球主管亚历杭德罗·沃纳（Alejandro Werner）表示，IMF预计今年年底委内瑞拉通货膨胀率将达到1,000,000 % 。	CAMBRIDGE – On July 23, Alejandro Werner, the Director of the International Monetary Fund’s Western Hemisphere Department, announced that the Fund was expecting inflation in Venezuela to reach 1,000,000% by year’s end.
这套管理结构既缺乏民主合理性，也没有取得令人信服的业绩（这套体系似乎仅仅对来自金融市场的压力被动做出反应 ） 。	This management structure is neither democratically legitimate nor justified by its performance (which appears to consist of mere reactions to pressure from financial markets).
那个时候，利他主义行为主要也是由家族来承担，钱怎么花，花在哪里，决定权都在家族手里，而不是在企业或其股东以及其他利益相关者身上。	Altruism, where it existed, also was undertaken by the family, which decided how and on what to spend its money. Whether the firm or its shareholders and other stakeholders spent the money was beside the point.
越南海鲜和钢铁行业主要出口商已经受到美国新关税政策的冲击，而其他行业（如纺织业）有可能是下一个受害者。	Major Vietnamese exporters of seafood and steel have already been hit with new US tariffs,and additional sectors, such as textiles, could be next.
当形势急转直下时，或出现国家灾难时，月球轨道飞行器在天空中划过的记忆将让人们保持未来属于印度的信念 。 ”	When the chips are down, or if there is a national calamity, memories of the Mars orbiter blazing a trail in the sky will sustain the faith that the future belongs to India.”
只有长期的、以市场为导向的、经济上可行的并且可持续的能源选择才能确保石油生产国和出口国都能保持经济的增长。	Only long-term, market-oriented, economically viable, and sustainable energy options can ensure economic growth in both producing and consuming countries.
尽管某些足球比赛曾经激起暴力，甚至有一次引发了战争，但它们可能已经通过转移注意力，抑制了我们更加野蛮的冲动。	Even though some football games have provoked violence, and in one case even a war, they might have served the positive purpose of containing our more savage impulses by deflecting them onto a mere sport.
经济学家相信许多在医疗卫生质量方面的提升 — — 例如对白内障和心脏疾病的更有效治疗 — — 有在实际GDP方面得到准确的体现，甚至因为价格提升而受到错误报道。	Economists believe that many improvements in health-care quality – such as more effective treatments for cataracts or cardiac disease – are not accurately reflected in real GDP, and are incorrectly reported as price increases.
他们害怕步天主教教皇的后尘，教皇在新教改革过程中失去了很大的权力，而印刷机在向信徒传播新理念的过程中发挥了关键作用。	They feared going the way of the Catholic pope, who lost considerable authority during the Protestant Reformation, when the printing press played a key role in spreading new ideas to the faithful.
本协议中的劳工标准并不得力，这些标准鼓励公司走低端道路来竞争，但低端道路会导致公司与中国极为低下的工资水平撞车。	The anemic labor standards enshrined in this agreement encourage firms to compete by taking the low road, a route that puts them on a collision course with China’s rock-bottom wages.
尽管如此，工业部门仍在欧盟经济中扮演着关键角色，雇用了3 400多万工人，贡献了80%的出口，也提供了很大一部分私人研发投资。	Nonetheless, the industrial sector continues to play a key role in the EU economy, employing more than 34 million people and accounting for 80% of exports, while providing a substantial share of private investment in research and development.
但在新古典预测模型的阳春白雪中，它的意思是，掌握了关于自身、周边环境以及所要面临的未来的详细知识的人，会采取实现他们的目标的最优行动。	But in the rarefied world of neoclassical forecasting models, it means that people, equipped with detailed knowledge of themselves, their surroundings, and the future they face, act optimally to achieve their goals.
究其原因虽然恐怖主义是一种潜在威胁，但非洲儿童面临的最主要的危险依然来自于疾病，而日常免疫往往就是疾病的预防举措。	That is because, though terrorism is an insidious threat, the biggest risk to Africa’s children is disease, which often can be prevented through routine immunization.
他粗俗地用大屠杀隐喻描绘伊朗威胁，看上去他更像是眼看就要被激动的暴徒袭击的犹太居民区长老，而不像是中东最强大国家的总理。	In his vulgar use of Holocaust metaphors to portray the Iranian threat, he sounds more like the principal of a Jewish ghetto about to be annihilated by an agitated mob than the prime minister of the most powerful country in the Middle East.
特朗普坚持认为向一小部分进口钢铁 — — 其价格早就在全球范围内设定好了 — — 征收关税足以应对一场真正的战略威胁。	Trump insists that a tariff on a small fraction of imported steel – the price of which is set globally – will suffice to address a genuine strategic threat.
我终身生活在欧洲，多数时间都在比利时，但从没在爱尔兰生活过；我也从未参与过投票，虽然《马斯特里赫特条约》规定我有权参加欧洲和比利时的国内选举。	I have lived in Europe all my life, mostly in Belgium, but never in Ireland, and I have never voted, despite the fact that the Maastricht treaty entitles me to vote both in European elections and in Belgium’s local elections.
在撒切尔夫人执政之前，英国被广泛认为是“欧洲病夫 ” ， 饱受令人窒息的监管、居高不下的失业、没完没了的罢工和旷日持久的预算赤字的折磨。	Before Thatcher’s premiership, Britain was widely considered the “sick man of Europe” – afflicted by stifling regulation, high unemployment, constant strikes, and chronic budget deficits.
同样，据国际劳工组织警告 ，柬埔寨、印尼、菲律宾、泰国和越南就业总人数的56 % “ 将在未来十年或20年因为技术的发展而面临失业的威胁 。 ”	Similarly, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has warned that 56% of total employment in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam is “at high risk of displacement due to technology over the next decade or two.”
尽管目前看来这种可能性还不大，但随着反对筑坝工程的力量越来越大，中国的领导人可能会发现：如果他们不能迅速采取行动，就面临着被这股浪潮吞没的危险。	While this is currently an unlikely outcome, as the anti-dam protests gather strength, China’s leaders may realize that if they do not move quickly, they risk being swept away.
英国退欧谈判毫无疑问将漫长而艰难 — — 而如果公民、企业或谈判员本身在过度的预期得不到满足之后感到沮丧的话，将更加如此。	The Brexit talks will undoubtedly be long and difficult – all the more so if citizens, businesses, or the negotiators themselves become discouraged, after excessive expectations are not met.
欧盟银行之所以会发挥不同作用是有结构和历史原因的，我们也不应指望欧洲资本市场能完全遵循其北美同行的运作模式。	There are structural and historical reasons for the different role played by EU banks, and one should not expect European capital markets precisely to follow the pattern of their North American counterparts.
而通过强化退休金制度，包括通过最低保障福利，政府可以为脆弱的老人群体提供安全网，降低预防性储蓄的激励。	And by strengthening pension systems, including through minimum guaranteed benefits, governments can provide a safety net for the vulnerable elderly and reduce incentives for precautionary savings.
最后，桑托斯与几位前任美洲峰会东道主一样别无选择，只能以个人名义告诉古巴他们不受欢迎，因为“关于他们参会的问题，没有形成一致意见 ” 。	In the end, Santos, like his summit-hosting predecessors, had no choice but to inform the Cubans personally that they were not welcome, as “there was no consensus regarding their participation.”
对提高生产率，创新，削减过剩产能以及向制造业和服务价值链上游迈进的相关强调也是这一努力的重要组成部分。	The related emphasis on productivity, innovation, pruning excess capacity, and moving up the value chain in manufacturing and services are underscored as key building blocks of this effort.
我们应该探索所有选项，如用无人机空投食品和药品供给、开发移动应用监控需要和追踪供给情况，以及保证援助工作者的安全。	We should be exploring every option, such as using drones to airdrop food and medical supplies, and developing mobile apps to monitor needs and track supplies on the ground, and to keep aid workers safer.
2011年，麻省理工学院（MIT）的布莱恩约尔弗森（Erick Brynjolfsson）及其同事发表了一项研究，他们发现使用数据驱动决策的公司生产率比不使用数据决策的公司高5—6 % 。	A study published in 2011 by MIT’s Erik Brynjolfsson and his colleagues found that companies using data-driven decision-making had a 5-6% higher productivity rate than those that did not.
显然可以从上面提到的卫星图片开始，但接着我们持怀疑态度的对话者就会理所当然地问我们是否了解图片的出处。	The obvious place to begin would be to point to the aforementioned satellite images, but then our skeptical interlocutor could reasonably ask if you know how those images were obtained.
几年前，库什纳及其父购买了纽约最昂贵的建筑第五大街666号，致使他们无法偿还抵押贷款，并因此背上了巨额债务。	A few years ago, Kushner and his father bought the most expensive building in New York City, 666 Fifth Avenue, leaving them enormously indebted and unable to finance the mortgage.
和20世纪90年代自由化改革后发生民粹主义回潮的许多拉美国家不同，智利的主要挑战者甚至是更加坚定的市场联盟。	Unlike many Latin American countries, in which populist backlashes have followed the liberalizing reforms of the 1990’s, the main challenger in Chile is an even more pro-market coalition.
2005年出版的，由张戎所著的著名传记《毛泽东：鲜为人知的故事》详细讲述了那些可怕的事件，其中一些令人绝望的细节让这些共产主义的宣传者们非常恐慌 — — 而一些学院派的汉学家甚至批评道毛泽东的成就被承认的部分太少。	Jung Chang’s famous biography of Mao, published in 2005, recounts those awful events in the sort of bleak detail that makes Communist propagandists nervous – and some academic Sinologists critical that Mao’s achievements go too little recognized.
这对总统产生了显著的影响，他“显得筋疲力尽、臃肿和极度兴奋 ， ” 同时又“情绪低落、无法集中精力和不耐烦 。 ”	This had a visible impact on the president, who according to Gergen, “seemed worn out, puffy, and hyper,” as well as “out of sorts, easily distracted, and impatient.”
If we can afford that much to save banks, we can afford something more to save the planet.	If we can afford that much to save banks, we can afford something more to save the planet.
这些科技进步中的一部分是理论层面上的。 这使我们能够为诸如洲际范围的森林或整个海洋一类的复杂系统建立计算机模型。	Some of these advances are theoretical, allowing us to build computer models of complex systems like continent-wide forests or entire oceans.
但同样不可或缺的是一种热情表达的道德信念，即“在我们的学校中学习的移民的女儿”是共同的我们中间的真正的一员，拥有完全的权利。	Yet just as indispensable is the moral conviction, passionately expressed, that the “immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools” is a genuine member, with full rights, of that common us.
它们对涉及到的人员有直接的影响，也正是因此而严格禁止登记任何有关种族血缘的信息。 1978年的法律允许政府统计工作者询问“微妙的”问题，条件是这些问题和调查有关而且经过被调查者同意。	The 1978 law allows government statisticians to ask “delicate” questions only if these questions are relevant for the survey and with the consent of the person polled.
据世界卫生组织刚刚发布的2016年《世界疟疾报告 》 （ World Malaria Report ） ， 2000年以来五岁以下儿童疟疾致死率下降了69 % 。	According to the World Health Organization’s just-released 2016 World Malaria Report, malaria mortality rates among children under age five have fallen by 69% since 2000.
但能源消费者与生产者之间利益的天然分歧，又被打上了政治与安全方面的色彩，于是便出现了关于“能源北约”的讨论。	But the natural differences in the interests of energy consumers and producers have been given a political/security twist – witness the discussions about an “Energy NATO.”
即便台湾人表决同意加入联合国，中国在联合国内的影响力也会阻止这样的行动，但是国际对抗是中国在奥运会举办期间最不想发生的事情。	China’s influence within the UN would prevent such a move even if Taiwan voted yes, but an international confrontation is the last thing China wants coinciding with the Olympics.
由此导致的持续低增长、高就业和不平等性加剧助长进一步政治动荡和分裂，而这有更深地破坏官员实施有效经济政策的能力。	The resulting persistence of low growth, high unemployment, and rising inequality fuels continued political instability and fragmentation, which further undermines officials’ capacity to implement effective economic policies.
但本次选举和两次大战期间结果的唯一共同点似乎是经济危机都增强了极端左翼的力量。 然而情况早已发生了剧变！	The only point in common with the interwar results seems to be that economic crisis then as now strengthened the radical left.
最终，人们衡量风险和在充分掌握信息的情况下做出选择的能力对于规管毒品的使用方面非常重要，也有助于体现更为人性化和高效的法律和政策。	At the end of the day, the capacity of people to evaluate risks and make informed choices will be as important to regulating the use of drugs as more humane and efficient laws and policies.
然而，随着日本政治体系在功能失调的两党政体下陷入旷日持久的过渡之中，近期的政府极不稳定且脆弱不堪，根本无法满足任何一方的要求。	But, with Japan’s political system mired in a protracted transition under a dysfunctional two-party regime, recent governments have been unstable and weak, unable to satisfy either side’s demands.
但反对派的指责 — — 普京政权纯粹由“骗子和小偷”组成 — — 将引起更多的公民，因为俄罗斯人民现在只要环顾四周就可以看到果。	But the opposition’s charge that Putin’s regime is composed of “swindlers and thieves” will resonate more strongly, because Russians can now see the results all around them.
同样，不允许任何与俄国银行或企业有业务往来的银行进入美国金融系统可以在俄国制造出共产主义刚刚倒台时那样的经济混乱。	Similarly, denying any bank that does business with a Russian bank or company access to the US financial system would create the kind of economic chaos last seen in Russia immediately after the fall of Communism.
中国正在进入新的发展阶段，公共部门、收入分配、土地所有制、户籍制度和金融部门等关键领域的制度改革已经成为当务之急。	China is entering a new phase of development, and institutional reform in key areas – particularly the public sector, income distribution, land ownership, the household registration system, and the financial sector – has become imperative.
霍尔姆斯在知道爱迪生系列设备没有效果后的很长时间内还一直在吹嘘她公司的透明度，并陶醉于它所得到天价估值。 她不仅是打破了黄金法则；她彻底熔化了公众的信任。	Holmes, who was touting her company’s transparency and reveling in its massive valuation long after she knew that the Edison machines were not cutting it, did not just break the Golden Rule; she melted it down.
因此目标应当是找到尽管在经济上有利可图，但却因为制度和其他障碍而无法吸引私人投资者的项目，然后，竭尽全力保证这些障碍的消除。	The goal should be to identify projects that, despite being economically profitable, are unattractive to private investors, owing to institutional and other barriers, and then work to remove those obstacles.
在全球贸易中扮演重大角色并有助于推动许多新兴经济体经济 — — 特别是中国 — — 增长的电子产品装配业职位尤其脆弱。	Jobs in electronics assembly, which plays a huge role in global trade and has helped to drive growth in many emerging economies – notably, China – are particularly vulnerable.
没有充分的监管，个人和企业就没有激励采取充分的预防措施，因为它们知道，极端事件的大部分成本会由其他人承担。	Without adequate regulations, individuals and firms have no incentive to take adequate precautions, because they know that much of the cost of extreme events will be borne by others.
平心而论，增长仍不平均，也不可靠，主要体现了石油产出的增长。 石油生产已经恢复到每天近四百万桶的制裁前水平。	To be sure, growth remains uneven and shaky, and mostly reflects the growth of oil output, which has attained its pre-sanctions level of nearly four million barrels a day.
联合国已宣布2016-2025年为“营养行动十年 ” ， 而联合国可持续发展目标则对改善健康、消除饥饿和促进可持续农业的全面战略持鼓励态度。	The United Nations has declared 2016-2025 the “Decade of Action on Nutrition,” and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals encourage comprehensive strategies for improving health, eliminating hunger, and promoting sustainable agriculture.
合作社最根本的价值在于，它不仅是一种人文愿景，也是一种可以使成功的合作社更加繁荣的务实的生产方式，也可以刺激极需这种务实生产方式的地方发展其经济。	The foundational values of cooperatives embody not only a humane vision, but also a pragmatic approach to production that has enabled the successful ones to thrive – and to spur economic growth in countries that desperately need it.
但是，尽管两国在2010年签订了防务和安全合作条约，英国人仍借口预算问题采购与法国航母不兼容的战斗机。	But, despite the two countries’ 2010 treaty on defense and security cooperation, the British have decided, for budgetary reasons, to acquire aircraft that will not be compatible with French aircraft carriers.
债权人至少在六百年前就已经知道哦这一点。 当时，西班牙国王菲利普二世成为世界上首位已知的系列主权违约者。	Creditors have known this since at least the sixteenth century, when Spain’s King Philip II became the world’s first known serial sovereign defaulter.
在美国企业一马当先的IT业最新领域 — — 云计算，许多国家的企业和企业家正在探索建立非美国替代品。	In one of the newest IT fields, cloud computing, where US firms are pioneers, firms and entrepreneurs in many countries are exploring the creation of non-US alternatives.
除了BJP集体上Twitter之外 — — 莫迪的网上盟友包括BJP议会领袖斯瓦拉伊（Sushma Swaraj）和一个有组织支持者团体 — — 各党派的主流印度政客纷纷进入社交媒体。	Aside from the BJP’s wholesale adoption of Twitter – Modi’s allies on the network include the party’s parliamentary leader, Sushma Swaraj, and a coterie of organized supporters – prominent Indian politicians from all parties have leapt in.
如今，向诺欣（Noushin ） — —她是一位伊斯法罕女生，她告诉BBC，自己的梦想是成为一名机械工程师 — — 这样的女生根本无从实现自己的雄心壮志，尽管她们在入学考试中获得了高分。	Now, women like Noushin, a student from Esfahan who told the BBC that she wanted to be a mechanical engineer, are unable to achieve their ambitions, despite getting high scores on their entrance exams.
同样，去年年底，冰岛政府也曾请求俄罗斯帮助其银行体系摆脱困境，而巴基斯坦总统阿西夫·阿里·扎尔达里也曾访华，希望能获得救援现金的注入。	Similarly, late last year, Iceland’s government asked Russia to help bail out its banking system, while Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari visited China in hopes of securing an emergency infusion of cash.
第二次世界大战后，凯恩斯所担忧的问题逐渐淡化为背景，因为复兴的西方繁荣让许多人相信这些问题已经永久得到了解决。	After World War II, the problems that concerned Keynes faded into the background, as renewed prosperity in the West led many to believe that they had been permanently solved.
去年，美联储仅仅宣布将逐渐减少其月度长期金融资产购买量便在全球金融市场和新兴市场引发了“取消”之怒。	Last year, the Fed’s mere announcement that it would gradually wind down its monthly purchases of long-term financial assets triggered a “taper” tantrum in global financial markets and emerging markets.
与此对照的是，八月末，欧洲央行总裁特里谢谈及危机前做出的货币政策决定来为可能的升息提供理由，然后又维持利率不变。	By contrast, in late August, the ECB’s governor, Jean-Claude Trichet, referred to the monetary-policy decision taken before the crisis to justify the possibility of a rate hike, then left rates on hold.
事实上，美国经济的表现自危机爆发以来都与欧元区非常类似：两岸如今的人均GDP依然比2007年水平低2 % 。	And, indeed, US economic performance has been very similar to that of the eurozone since the start of the crisis: GDP per capita today is still about 2% below the 2007 level on both sides of the Atlantic.
但官僚主义、宣传和误导使得数百万非洲农民（包括肯尼亚农民）无法获得这一可以改善生活质量、有助于解决粮食短缺的技术。	But bureaucracy, propaganda, and misinformation are preventing millions of African farmers, including in Kenya, from accessing a technology that can improve livelihoods and help to redress food shortages.
Enfin, l’Europe doit insister davantage sur la recherche fondamentale.	Finally, Europe must place more emphasis on basic research.
新德里 — — 印巴查谟及克什米尔边境控制线（LoC）上的最新事态再度将印度与其核武装邻国巴基斯坦关系的根本问题摆在了人们面前。	NEW DELHI – Recent incidents on the Line of Control (LoC) – the frontier between India and Pakistan in the state of Jammu and Kashmir – have again raised fundamental questions about the nuclear-armed neighbors’ fraught relationship.
与此同时，欧洲表现出团结的自私，扼杀了一个在意大利和希腊为区区40,000寻求庇护者提供收容的计划。	Meanwhile, Europe, in a display of united selfishness, has scuttled a plan to relocate a mere 40,000 asylum-seekers from their cities of refuge in Italy and Greece.
但是，不那么显而易见的是，这些借款人接着需���来自金融机构的更多的税收诱发的贷款，因为纳税好处让他们自身使用债务变得更廉价了。	But, less obviously, these borrowers then demand more tax-induced lending from financial institutions, because tax benefits make their own use of debt cheaper.
在今年6月3日，当我同其他记者一道参观关塔那摩的时候，那里的新闻办公室公布了一则简短的公告：阿尔-哈纳什被发现死在他自己的牢房内 — — 一起“显而易见的自杀事件 ” 。	On June 3, while I was visiting Guantánamo with other journalists, the press office there issued a terse announcement that al-Hanashi had had been found dead in his cell – an “apparent suicide.”
1996—2000年，真实（经通胀调整的）GDP增长平均为4.3 % ， 生产率每年提高2.5 % ， 其中工人所获的好处 — — 每小时真实报酬增长率为每年2.2 % 。	Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth averaged 4.3% during 1996-2000, productivity increased by 2.5% per year, and workers received their share of those gains as real compensation per hour rose at a 2.2% annual pace.
在这方面，阿尔及利亚对非盟的一贯支持以及对地区安全的付出 — — 其在马里和平协议中所扮演的作用以及主办利比亚谈判就是明证 — — 对它十分有利。	Here, Algeria’s consistent support for the AU and its commitment to regional security – exemplified in its role in the Mali peace agreement and its hosting of the Libya talks – would speak in its favor.
议会选举的投票率只有40 % ， 这个数字使波兰排在了世界民主国家选民参选状况的末尾，比欧洲平均水平低25到30个百分点。	Turnout for the parliamentary election was 40%, which puts Poland near the bottom in voter participation among the democratic nations of the world, and about 25-30% below the European average.
此外下一轮金德尔伯格序列的种子 — — 失业，乐观，狂热，崩溃，恐慌，反感，抹黑 — — 已经被解决上一次经济衰退所需的政策所种下了。	Moreover, the seeds of the next Kindlebergian sequence – displacement, optimism, enthusiasm, crash, panic, revulsion, discrediting – have already been sown by the very policies that were needed to address the last downturn.
一旦税收立法讨论完毕 — — 特别是如果它向今年早些时候的共和党的医疗改革方案那样遭到耻辱性失败 — — 特朗普将会在贸易问题上表现出要言行一致的样子。	Once tax legislation is off the table – and especially if it fails ignominiously in the same manner as the Republicans’ health-care-reform effort earlier this year – Trump will want to show that he means what he has said on trade.
在德国，对两代中产阶级债券持有人的剥夺被看作是德国皇帝战争以及随后希特勒战争所导致的恶果 — — 换言之，这意味着民主制度的失败。	In Germany, the expropriation of two generations of middle-class bond holders was seen as the outcome of the Kaiser’s war, and then of Hitler’s war – in other words, a result of democratic failure.
资本市场改革 — — 特别是发展更加稳健的股票和债券市场，扩大长期以银行系统为核心的信用中介体系 — — 对于这一目标至关重要。	Capital-market reforms – especially the development of more robust equity and bond markets to augment a long dominant bank-centric system of credit intermediation – are critical to this objective.
哈佛大学的丹尼·罗德里克（Dani Rodrik）最近强调 ， “ 存在一个可以将愤怒引导过去的明确的‘他者 ’ 。 ” 不管这个他者是中国出口商、墨西哥移民、推定的伊斯兰恐怖分子还是贪婪的华尔街银行家。	Whether it is Chinese exporters, Mexican immigrants, presumed Islamic terrorists, or greedy Wall Street bankers, “there is,” as Harvard’s Dani Rodrik recently stressed, “a clear ‘other’ toward which anger can be directed.”
上周以色列选举结束后，全世界的以色列朋友应该把这个咒语改一改 ： “ 让朋友盲目统治的不是真朋友 。 ”	After Israel’s election last week, the country’s friends around the world should adopt a similar slogan: “Friends don’t let friends govern blind.”
但正如萨莫斯和其他人指出的那样，宽松货币政策或许会引发资产泡沫，而旷日持久的财政刺激则会导致一场债务危机。	But, as Summers and others point out, lax monetary policies may trigger asset bubbles, and prolonged fiscal stimulus may end in a debt crisis.
在这样的背景下，日本首相安倍晋三最近面临一个关键决定：是否完成计划中的将消费税从8%提高到10%的政策。	Against this background, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was recently faced with a key decision: whether to follow through with a planned consumption-tax hike, from 8% to 10%.
只有实行影响俄国民众（毕竟是他们一而再再而三地投票让普京当选）的实���在在的经济制裁才有望使克里姆林放弃其扩张进程。	Only actions that impose tangible economic sanctions that affect Russian citizens – who, after all, have voted Putin into power time and again – offer any hope of steering the Kremlin away from its expansionist course.
从这个意义上讲这些目标驳斥了这样一种观点，即实现繁荣和安全最大化的最佳途径是将本国家利益置于首位，同时将自身与邻国隔离开来。	In that sense, the goals refute the view that the best way to maximize prosperity and security is to put one’s own country and its interests first, while walling it off from its neighbors.
最后，政府必须实施法规，在保护投资者、消费者和赋予银行、零售企业及金融技术电信企业竞争和创新空间之间实现动态的平衡。	Finally, governments must implement regulations that strike a balance between protecting investors and consumers, and giving banks, retailers, and financial-technology and telecommunications companies room to compete and innovate.
YouGov/Times最近的一项民意调查预测，保守党将获得44％的选票，而工党，自由民主党和独立党的得票分别为23 % ， 12%和10 ％ 。	A recent YouGov/Times poll predicted that the Conservatives would receive 44% of the vote, compared to 23% for the Labour Party, 12% for the Liberal Democrats, and 10% for the UK Independence Party.
黎巴嫩战争严厉地提醒欧盟，它具有“战略利益 ” ， 首先而且最重要的是安全利益，而且，如果它有意回避这些利益，代价将是巨大的。	The Lebanon War has served as a harsh reminder to the European Union that it has “strategic interests” – security interests first and foremost – and that, should it choose to ignore them, the price will be high.
其目的不在于解决直接面临的问题，而在于引导新的效率更高的活动以助债务转化为资产并最大限度地利用经济的产能。	The aim was not to tackle the problems they faced directly, but to induce new, more efficient activities that would help to turn debt into assets and maximize use of the economy’s capacity.
在1980年代末各主要工业化国家 — — 美国，欧洲和日本 — — 开始推动更强势的专利制度以提高本国制药公司的利润。	In the late 1980s, the leading industrialized countries – the United States, Europe, and Japan – began to push for stronger patent regimes that would boost their own pharmaceutical companies’ profits.
为买入危险性资产而需要的额外5000亿美元的出现将减少危险资产的数量，这些是私有投资人所必须持有的。	The appearance of an extra $500 billion in demand for risky assets will reduce the quantity of risky assets that other private investors will have to hold.
联合国虽未破裂，但却困难重重，特别是越来越多的国家将其视为礼节性的外交马后炮，并在其他地方寻找全球重大问题的解决办法。	The UN is not broken, but it is in trouble, particularly as more countries treat it as a polite diplomatic afterthought and seek solutions to major global problems elsewhere.
劳动力市场长期萎靡意味着大部分工人实际工资在下降，而随着你在工资分布中位置的下移，消极影响接踵而至。	Prolonged labor-market slack means falling real wages for most workers, with the negative effect growing as one moves down the wage distribution.
但解决办法是采取更严厉的措施 — — 如加大惩罚甚至逐出联盟 — — 以执行欧元区规则，还是需要更改规则以协调成员国之间不同的环境？	But does the remedy lie in tougher measures – such as heavier penalties or even eviction – to enforce the eurozone’s rules, or do the rules need to be adjusted to accommodate members’ varying circumstances?
他们的论据是，如果你允许政府禁止你所讨厌或鄙视的观点，你就削弱了你自己挑战针对你所同意的观点的类似禁令的权利。	Their argument was that if you allow the government to ban opinions you hate or despise, you weaken your right to contest a similar ban on views with which you might agree.
很容易将巨额贸易赤字归咎于阻挠美国政府在本国市场销售的外国政府，这伤害了美国企业，也降低了这些企业员工的生活水平。	It is easy to blame the large trade deficit on foreign governments that block the sale of US products in their markets, which hurts American businesses and lowers their employees’ standard of living.
哈佛大学的鲁比卡·尼德尔科斯卡（Ljubica Nedelkoska）发现，如今，2010年危机爆发后从希腊返回祖国的阿尔巴尼亚人纷纷成为企业家，提高了从未离开故土的阿尔巴尼亚人的就业和工资。	Today, Albanians returning to their country from Greece after the 2010 crisis there became entrepreneurs and increased the employment and wages of those who never left, as shown by Harvard’s Ljubica Nedelkoska.
而后在4月30日，特朗普的国家安全顾问约翰·博尔顿提出了煽动性的建议，即要求朝鲜无核化遵循“利比亚模式 ” 。	And then, on April 30, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, made the incendiary suggestion that North Korea could follow the “Libya model” of denuclearization.
在利比里亚总统Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf撤销了作为新指挥部东道国的提议后，他又请求尼日利亚国会勾销了利比里亚所欠4300万美元双边债务中的1300万。	He then asked Nigeria’s National Assembly to write off $13 million of Liberia’s $43 million bilateral debt after Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf withdrew her offer to host the new command.
但是，这些措施只是导致了更大的经济不稳定以及更大的不平等，而没有达到其所承诺的充分就业或者生产性就业的目的。	But this has merely contributed to greater economic insecurity and greater inequality, while failing to achieve either full or productive employment, as promised.
事实上，随着总理内塔尼亚胡将以色列推向���自由的民主，他也在依靠东欧日益不自由的政府帮助以色列抵挡不利的欧盟政策。	And, in fact, as Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu edges Israel toward illiberal democracy, he is counting on Eastern Europe’s increasingly illiberal governments to help shield Israel from adverse EU initiatives.
仇恨言论之所以应被禁止，之所以应在全世界国家受到法律严惩，是因为它意在煽动针对某个特定国家、种族、民族或宗教群体的歧视和暴力。	What is objectionable about hate speech, and makes it punishable by law in countries around the world, is that it is intended to incite discrimination or violence against members of a particular national, racial, ethnic, or religious group.
但如果亨利·华莱士（Henry Wallace）当了总统（如果罗斯福没有在1944年用杜鲁门替换他做了副总统，这完全是可能的 ） ， 可能会改变美国的反应风格。	But a Henry Wallace presidency (which would have occurred if FDR had not switched him for Harry Truman as vice president in 1944) might have changed the style of the US response.
这种不可避免的宿命感远远胜过真正的反欧洲信念， 阻止英国改变其直到2016年还鲜有选民真正赞同的毫无意义且自我毁灭政策的可能结果。	This sense of inevitability, far more than genuine anti-European conviction, is what has discouraged Britain from changing its mind about a pointless and self-destructive policy that few voters cared about until 2016.
但如果其他欧洲国家接受其偏好，并且欧洲继续其失衡一体化道路，就不会有任何力量能说服法国支持政治联盟。	But if other European countries accept this preference, and Europe continues along its unbalanced integration path, there will be no leverage to convince France to support political union.
美国政府非但没有中止其副总统拜登访问北京之旅以示不满，反而建议商业航班尊重中国单方面宣布的防空识别区。	Instead of demonstrating its disapproval by postponing Vice President Joe Biden’s trip to Beijing, the US government advised commercial airlines to respect China’s self-declared ADIZ.
尽管如此，如果特朗普和金正恩的峰会要想取得持续的效果，断不能仅仅试图破事朝鲜去核化、而要寻求让朝鲜向世界敞开国门的更广泛的战略协议。	Nonetheless, if Trump’s summit with Kim is to have a lasting impact, it is essential to move beyond simply trying to force North Korea to denuclearize and pursue a broader strategic deal aimed at opening the North to the world.
随着世界政治的构造板块的变迁，德国必须更准确地定位自身在维持现有国际秩序结构和建立新结构过程中的作用。	As the tectonic plates of world politics shift, Germany must be more precise in defining its own contributions to maintaining existing structures of international order and establishing new ones.
托克维克拒绝反动的恋旧，认为我们注定会获得民主的胜利，同时又警告民主对自由构成危险。 他因此理所当然地闻名于世。	Tocqueville is justly famous for rejecting reactionary nostalgia and regarding democracy’s triumph as our destiny, while warning against the dangers that democracy holds for liberty.
地震给了它们一个机会来展示自己，而且，前所未有的人有了机会把这一新生的民间社会看作是一个符合他们利益的积极力量。	The quake gave them an opportunity to be seen, and an unprecedented number of people had a chance to perceive this nascent civil society as a positive force that serves their own interests.
但实际证明这完全不受支持，普京支持率在今年春天以来至少下降了十多个百分点，来到2014年吞并克里米亚之前的最低值。	But it has proven to be spectacularly unpopular, with Putin’s approval rating plummeting at least a dozen percentage points since the spring, to a level not seen since before the 2014 annexation of Crimea.
如果奥巴马选择忽略这些要求，最终协定将更加极化 — — 国会将在几乎没有民主党支持的情况下通过该协定。	If it chooses to ignore such demands, the final agreement would be much more polarizing – and would be approved by Congress with very little Democratic support.
拉美和加勒比地区正在采取统一行动帮助降低全球排放，如果有来自发达国家的资金和技术转移，我们可以做更多的事。	Latin America and the Caribbean are taking concerted action to help bringing down global emissions and could do much more with funding and technology transfers from developed countries.
不然的话各国将难以构思出一个共同的未来 — — 而没有了这些，当年催生了北非革命之火的经济苦难必将卷土重来。	Otherwise, it will be difficult even to conceive a common future – without which the economic grievances that fueled the Maghreb’s revolutions are likely to continue.
私下谈话中，你甚至可能会把他当成自由派成员 — — 自由派是由受过良好教育的年轻宣传官员组成的新团体，这些官员政治敏感性的门槛正在不断提高。	In private conversation, one might even take him for a liberal – one of a new breed of young and well-educated propaganda officials with an increasingly higher threshold of political sensitivity.
与此同时，双方都冒着扰乱转移支付（包括老人补助）和公共服务供给的风险，甚至进一步威胁到美国的全球信用。	In the meantime, both sides risk disrupting transfer payments (including to the elderly) and the provision of public services, as well as eroding further America’s global credit standing.
与此同时，因为对包括颇受欢迎的篮球明星勒布朗·詹姆斯在内的批评者发起人身攻击，唐纳德·特朗普总统可能正在损害其本人及其政党的选举前景，尤其是在郊区妇女群体当中。	At the same time, President Donald Trump may be hurting his and his party’s electoral prospects, especially among suburban women, by launching personal attacks against those who criticize him – including the popular basketball star LeBron James.
更糟的是，一名能干而且诚实的政治家可能确实选择了最佳政策；但在不完全信息环境下，她可能无法说服选民她做了正确的事。	Worse, an able and honest politician may indeed choose the best policies; but, in an environment of imperfect information, she may be unable to persuade voters that she did the right thing.
此外，德国与V4的贸易增长迅猛，2016年同比增加了9 % ， 而与其传统最大贸易伙伴国法国的贸易增长只有0.6 % 。	Moreover, Germany’s trade with the V4 is growing fast, with a year-on-year increase of 9% in 2016, while its trade with France, traditionally its largest trading partner, grew at a sluggish 0.6% that year.
实现愿望现实的方法是：训练欧洲自己的伊斯兰教领袖，提高清真寺对周边地区的凝聚力，鼓励穆斯林积极参与公众辩论。	It can be given shape by, for example, training imams in Europe, by encouraging mosques to promote social cohesion in their neighborhoods, and by more active participation by Muslims in the public debate.
但如果这些公司被迫披露知识产权，它们的商业模式就会被破坏，因为本地企业也能很有效地在这一市场 — — 在其他市场也一样 — — 竞争。	But if such companies are forced to reveal their IP, their business models are destroyed, as local players can then compete effectively in that market – and potentially in others.
虽然这些担心几乎没有达到像诺贝尔经济学奖��得者约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨这样的人进行的完全的正面攻击的程度，它们仍然表明了一个显著的学术氛围的转变。	While these worries hardly amount to the full frontal attack mounted by the likes of Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-prize winning economist, they still constitute a remarkable turnaround in the intellectual climate.
因为对中国结构的变化了解甚少，外国人一直在对中国进行投资、购买中国的产品以及与中国进行贸易，并且大加赞赏它令人惊异、但却高速前进的“经济增长 ” 。	With little knowledge of China’s tectonic changes, foreigners have been investing, buying, trading, and extravagantly praising its amazing, but hell-bent, “economic boom.”
布鲁塞尔 — — 世界如何利用能源已经成为全球变暖的热门话题，而对污染和资源紧张的担忧已经引发了一场虚拟的能效战略军备竞赛。	BRUSSELS – How the world uses energy is a hot topic for a warming planet, and fears of pollution and resource strain have produced a virtual arms race of energy-efficiency strategies.
其父遭毛泽东清洗后，他在1966-1976年的文化大革命爆发前就开始到乡下工作，并因此亲身体验到与他同代的很多人都曾经体验过的艰辛。	After his father was purged by Mao Zedong, he went to work in the countryside, even before the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution, experiencing firsthand all of the hardships that many of his generation endured.
它的一些成员显示出令人担忧的民粹主义倾向，但对议会投票模式的分析表明，到目前为止，即使是在非常棘手的问题上联盟依然能够达成共识。	Some of its members have displayed worrying populist tendencies, but an analysis of parliamentary voting patterns indicates that so far the coalition has been able to find agreement, even on very difficult issues.
没错，小唐纳德及其兄弟埃里克将留在纽约管理特朗普的组织，该组织负责监管其父名下各式各样的企业；但特朗普声称他将与儿子们保持距离本身就会削弱民众对他的信任度。	Yes, Donald, Jr. and his brother, Eric, will remain in New York to run the Trump Organization, which oversees their father’s diverse businesses; but Trump’s claim that his sons will remain at arm’s length strains credulity.
如果安理会无法就最终地位问题做出决定，这就将会产生严重的局面。 那就是，科索沃将会单方面宣布独立，而所有的国家都不得不决定是否承认这一新的国家。	If the Security Council fails to reach a decision on final status, it will produce a GRAVE situation: Kosovo would declare independence unilaterally, and all nations would have to make up their mind whether or not to recognize the new state.
此外，自1997年亚洲金融危机以来，亚洲新兴经济体已经增加了其持有的外汇储备，如今储备量已经占到世界总量一半以上。	Moreover, since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the region’s emerging economies have increased their holdings of foreign-exchange reserves, and now possess more than half of the world’s total.
另一个受害者是监管，至少在一段时间内是如此，因为决策者很难判断如何管理日益复杂、动态和虚拟的金融系统。	Another casualty will be regulation, at least for a while, as policymakers struggle to figure out how to manage an increasingly complex, dynamic, and virtual financial system.
在金正日又矮又胖的继承人 — — 即其三太子、人称“小将军”的金正恩 — — 治下，威胁和谎言仍是这一隐遁王国外交的特征。	Under the late Kim Jong-il’s pudgy young successor – his third son, Kim Jong-un, dubbed “the Young General” – threats and mendacity still mark the Hermit Kingdom’s diplomacy.
巨额的经常帐户赤字缺口（主要由短期资本流入填补 ） ， 国内政治不确定性以及过往的非常规货币政策经历等因素在最近几个月中损害了投资者信心。	Yawning current-account deficits (funded mainly by short-term capital inflows), domestic political uncertainty, and past episodes of unorthodox monetary policy have all undermined investor confidence in recent months.
一种办法是放大更讨他们喜欢的媒体的声音，比如《今日以色列 》 （ Israel Hayom，一家希伯来语免费日报，以为内塔尼亚胡唱赞歌为己任。 ）	One way to do that is to amplify the voices of more agreeable alternatives, such as Israel Hayom – a Hebrew-language free daily newspaper dedicated to singing Netanyahu’s praises.
立宪君主制限制了宫廷的奢侈浪费和军事冒险，这两样可以说是近代早期专制君主制（如法国和西班牙）的招牌。	Constitutional monarchy limited the scope for wasteful spending on luxurious court life (as well as on military adventure) – the hallmark of early modern autocratic monarchy.
非常规非常规货币政策的下个阶段 — — 如果衰退、通缩和金融危机风险显著上升的话 — — 可能有三个要素。	The next stage of unconventional unconventional monetary policy – if the risks of recession, deflation and financial crisis sharply increase – could have three components.
之后，在12月，纽约警方以在美给付佣人薪水低于美国最低工资、并伪造该佣人签证申请为由逮捕了印度领馆官员科巴拉加德。	Then, in December, the New York City police arrested an Indian consular official, Devyani Khobragade, for paying a domestic worker less than the minimum wage in the United States and for falsifying the worker’s visa application.
上述声明及时且具有历史意义，因为世界各国正致力于从控制气候变化、实现可持续发展目标到建立公海海洋保护区等领域全球协议的落实工作。	These statements of faith are both historic and timely, as the world’s countries seek to implement global agreements in areas ranging from climate change to the Sustainable Development Goals and the establishment of marine reserves on the high seas.
希腊在欧盟国家中国防开支相对于国内生产总值的占比排名第二；毋庸置疑，在当前经济环境下，在上述领域节约开支是大幅缓解预算压力的受欢迎举措。	Greece is the second-largest defense spender, relative to GDP, in the EU; clearly, in today’s economic climate, savings here could provide hugely welcome budget relief.
但是他们没能创造出一个有利于伊朗式的甘地站出来的环境，而是在无意识的情况下把霍梅尼推向了权力的中心，迎来了一个比他们帮助推翻的政权更加令人难以容忍的神权统治政权。	Instead of creating an atmosphere conducive to an Iranian Gandhi, they unwittingly helped usher into power Ayatollah Khomeini and a theocratic regime less tolerant than the one they helped unseat.
很有可能，地面部队最后由阿拉伯人、伊朗人和库尔德人组成，包括自由斗士国际旅（Peshmerga International Brigade）成员。	It may be that most of the boots on the ground will have to be worn by Arabs, Iranians, and Kurds, including members of the Peshmerga International Brigade.
在多德-弗兰克法案上，民主党人 — — 包括奥巴马 — — 显然在究竟应在何种程度上坚持自身提出的改革方面存在着分歧。	On Dodd-Frank, Democrats – including Obama – are apparently of two minds on the extent to which they should stick up for their own reforms.
用美国总统奥巴马的话说，该协议还建立了“必要的时间和地点”的检查机制，该机制或许能够证明伊朗是否兑现其各项承诺。	The agreement also establishes, in US President Barack Obama’s words, a “where necessary, when necessary” inspections mechanism that has the potential to verify whether Iran is meeting these and other commitments.
而且事实上，拟议改革的关键问题是要拓展私营部门在国家主导经济中的作用，从而在高生产率领域创造出更多的就业机会。	And, in fact, the crux of the proposed reforms is to expand the private sector’s role in the state-dominated economy, thereby creating more employment in higher-productivity areas.
首尔—半个多世纪以来，韩国取得了卓越的经济进步，人均收入从1960年的80美元增加到去年的22,000多美元。	SEOUL – Over the last half-century, South Korea has made considerable economic progress, with per capita income increasing from a mere $80 dollars in 1960 to more than $22,000 last year.
2015年，联合国难民署预算为70亿美元，看起来很大，但摊到每个流离失所者头上每人只有100美元 — — 不足以覆盖食品和住所等最基本的需要。	Its budget of $7 billion in 2015 may seem large, but it amounts to only about $100 per displaced person – not enough to cover even essentials like food and shelter.
2015年的巴黎气候协议 — — 各国政府同意限制排放并提供资源帮助较为贫困的国家适应气候变化 — — 是朝正确方向迈出的一步。	The 2015 Paris climate agreement – in which governments agreed to limit their emissions and to provide resources to help poorer countries adapt – was a step in the right direction.
当然，她这是典型的酸葡萄心理；两轮选举制度的全部意义就在于迫使政党和它们的支持者寻找共识，形成合作。	Her argument is, of course, a classic example of sour grapes; the entire point of a two-round voting system is to force parties and their supporters to seek a consensus and form partnerships.
美国家庭的债务/收入比率目前已下降至109 % ， 比2007年末的135%的峰值低了很多，但仍比20世纪后三十年的平均水平高了35个百分点。	The debt/income ratio for American households is now down to 109% – well below the peak of 135% reached in late 2007, but still 35 percentage points above the average over the final three decades of the twentieth century.
根据定义，第二种方法 — — 等人均累计排放量 — — 能根据各国以往所产生的气候变化效应进行完美公平分配的方法。	The second approach – equal per capita cumulative emissions – is, by definition, a way to produce perfect equality among all countries in the contribution that they will have made, over time, to climate change.
催生这次革命的或许是实际需要；但创造力与合作将证实从长远看这次革命能使全世界国家、企业和消费者有利可图。	This revolution may have been borne out of necessity; but, with ingenuity and cooperation, it will prove to be profitable, over the long run, for countries, manufacturers, and consumers worldwide.
其次，该宣言要求所有国家的民众和领袖尽早致力于100%可再生能源及零排放战略，同时认识到无限度追求经济增长并非可行的选择。	Second, the Declaration asks people and leaders from all countries to commit to 100% renewable energy and a zero-emissions strategy as soon as possible, and to recognize that unlimited economic growth is not a viable option.
实际上，真正纪念死难者唯一的方法不是简单地把城镇及经济恢复到之前日渐萎缩的状态，而是从海啸的废墟上创造出日本新的发展模式。	Indeed, the only way truly to honor those who lost their lives is to create a new-model Japan from the tsunami’s wreckage, rather than simply restoring towns and their economies to their previous decadent conditions.
CEP民调是智利最受尊敬的一项民调，从2004年以来所提出的问题一直非常相似，但得到的结果却令人费解。	The CEP poll, Chile’s most respected opinion survey, has been asking similar questions since 2004, with results that are just as puzzling.
美国的宣传献金限制相对较弱，因此公司和富豪 — — 他们总体而言并不注重收入分配 — — 在政客的选战基金中举足轻重。	The US has relatively weak campaign-finance limits, so corporations and wealthy individuals – neither of which generally prioritizes income redistribution – have contributed a disproportionate share to politicians’ campaign war chests.
他们将不得不顺应这一观点，即市场已经预计到下跌，他们只有在可能的期货价格下跌超过预期的幅度内保护自己。	They will have to get used to the idea that the market already expects the decline, and that they can protect themselves only for that margin of possible future price declines that exceed this expectation.
相反，这两个互相矛盾的叙事制造了一个恶性循环，助长了敌意，导致了希腊左翼政府赢得选举。 该政府身负反对紧缩的使命 — — 这给双方都会带来灾难性影响。	Instead, these clashing narratives created a deleterious spiral, fanning the flames of animosity and leading to the election of a left-wing government in Greece with a mandate to oppose austerity – with disastrous results for both sides.
从这个角度讲，民主 — — 许多人所谓的“自由民主 ” — —只有在工业革命引起民族国家的出现和群众剧变和动员后才可能发生。	Democracy in this sense – what many call “liberal democracy” – flourished only after the emergence of the nation-state and the popular upheaval and mobilization produced by the Industrial Revolution.
他们认为，居高不下的后金融危机时期失业率足以表明应该采取更为激进的财政扩张，就算美国和英国这样已经存在巨额赤字的国家也是如此。	They see lingering post-financial-crisis unemployment as a compelling justification for much more aggressive fiscal expansion, even in countries already running massive deficits, such as the US and the United Kingdom.
不再预防传染病爆发方面做出适当的投资将让我们所有人都面临风险，不管下一次爆发的是什么传染病、什么时候爆发。	Failing to invest appropriately in prevention of infectious-disease outbreaks puts all of us at risk, whenever or wherever the next one occurs.
一些基础设施，比如医生执业法已经存在，但仍需采取更多的措施，比如加强对妇产科（大量基因工程干预发生在这里）的监管。	While some of the infrastructure, such as licensure laws for physicians, is already in place, additional steps may be needed, such as heightened regulation of infertility clinics, where many genetic-engineering interventions will take place.
CBS新闻的另一则秘密报道采访了一位年仅十二岁的女孩，她用一张伪造的年龄证书得到了一份制衣厂的工作。	Another undercover report by CBS News interviewed a 12-year-old girl who obtained a factory job using a certificate that falsified her age.
而其中蕴含的经验也很清楚 ： “ 我们通过保卫自己的价值并引导自由的力量，使得我们的目标终获实现 。 ”	The lesson was clear: “we achieve our aims by defending our values and leading the forces of freedom.”
这也是本周举行的伊斯坦布尔发展对话（Istanbul Development Dialogues，联合国开发规划署组织的年度全球会议）的主要议题。	That will be the main topic at the Istanbul Development Dialogues, an annual global gathering organized by the UN Development Programme, this week.
世界银行最新报告显示截止2014年，144个国家已经制订了国家计划发展可再生能源，且有近100个国家已经出台了具体目标和激励举措。	According to a new World Bank report, as of 2014, 144 countries had established national plans to expand renewable energy, and almost 100 had set specific targets and incentives.
如今，耶稣会士第一次成为教皇，而且还用了一个相当不“耶稣会”的名字 — — 方济各，这进一步增加了离奇性。	Now, for the first time, a Jesuit has become pope – and has compounded the novelty by assuming the very un-Jesuit name of Francis.
有的已经在官邸中住了好几代人；在收到驱逐通知时，一些家族认为这些官邸事实上已经成为他们名人祖先的纪念所，因此应该允许他们住在其中。	In some cases, they had been there for generations; when faced with eviction notices, some families argued that the bungalows had effectively become memorials to their famous ancestors and that they should thus be allowed to remain.
这一计划与职业培训和让员工获得参与解决问题和决策一道，已经证明可以提高雇员参与度和忠诚度、降低跳槽率、提振生产率和利润。	Together with job training and opportunities for workers to participate in problem-solving and decision-making, such programs have been shown to foster employee engagement and loyalty, reduce turnover, and boost productivity and profitability.
数百名意识到其中的巨大成本 — — 和可观潜在收益 — — 的企业高管目前正在日本仙台出席联合国降低灾难风险会议。	Hundreds of business executives, aware of the dramatic costs – and potential benefits – at stake, are now preparing to attend a UN conference on disaster-risk reduction in Sendai, Japan.
推进这项计划可以优化现有成员国的资源运用 — — 从而产生有利的经济协同效应 — — 并准确找到实现我们目标所需的额外资源。	Advancing this plan will enable optimized use of existing member-state resources – thereby securing advantageous economic synergies – as well as precise identification of the additional resources required to achieve our goals.
根据美国法律，取代现行破产程序的新方针是让倒闭公司消失，而不是拯救它们 — — 不管是通过出售、合并还是清盘。	By law in the US, new approaches superseding established bankruptcy procedures dictate the demise rather than the rescue of failing firms, whether by sale, merger, or liquidation.
就在最近，普京的两个副手分别接受两家西方媒体的采访，谁知两人却对俄罗斯的未来发展提出了针锋相对的观点。	Just recently, two of Putin’s deputies gave interviews to two Western media outlets offering what sounded like starkly opposite visions for Russia’s development.
正因为当年在某些变量过于特异，同时另一些变量又过于模糊，使得联合国在萨尔瓦多的武器换土地协议必须重新谈判才得以实施。	Too much specificity on some variables and too much vagueness with regard to others required a renegotiation of the arms-for-land agreement in El Salvador to make it implementable.
越南与朝鲜、马来西亚不同，在那里牵制政策与对叛乱的镇压获得了成功。 因为南越共产党可以利用柬埔寨和老挝这两个“中立”区从侧翼突袭盟军。	Vietnam differed from Korea and Malaya, where containment and counterinsurgency prevailed, because the communists could outflank allied forces in South Vietnam by using “neutral” territory in Cambodia and Laos.
金融体系还无法胜任应对包容性金融的挑战，特别是中小企业融资和农村金融问题突出，在某些指定行业存在产能过剩风险。	The financial system has yet to address adequately the challenges of financial inclusivity, particularly funding of SMEs and rural areas, and exposure to excess capacity in selected industries.
相反，她的对手伯尔尼·桑德斯已经成为厉害的竞争者，因为他聪明地为他的选战制定了颇具说服力的口号：制度被操纵，腐败的选战金融机制把持了它。	By contrast, her rival, Bernie Sanders, has become a serious contender because he brilliantly composed a persuasive message for his campaign: The system is rigged and a corrupt campaign-finance regime is holding it in place.
发自纽黑文 — — 去年五月，由欧洲议会法律事务委员会成员，欧洲议会议员玛蒂·德尔沃（Mady Delvaux）编写的一份欧洲议会报告草案提出了向机器人征税的想法。	NEW HAVEN – The idea of a tax on robots was raised last May in a draft report to the European Parliament prepared by MEP Mady Delvaux from the Committee on Legal Affairs.
它们将维持错误的相对价格 — — 这是采用欧元后形成的南方通胀性信用泡沫带来的 — — 而这一错误的相对价格阻挠了欧元区南方国家重获竞争力。	They would sustain false relative prices – the result of the inflationary credit bubble in the south that formed after the euro’s adoption – that are preventing the euro’s southern European countries from regaining competitiveness.
收入再分配也许对于某些人很有吸引力 — — 包括（在较小程度上）支持一个淡化版本政策的共和党人，该政策用相对较高的边际税率支持扩大家庭援助 — — 但这只是愚人金。	Income redistribution may be an attractive idea for some – including, to a lesser extent, the Republicans who support a watered-down version, in which relatively high marginal tax rates support expanded family assistance – but it is fool’s gold.
但因为这种称之为CRISPR的工具能改变整个野生生物种群（并进而改变共同的生态系统 ） ， 确保上述工具的研发必须本着负责任的态度也为科学和社会带来了前所未有的挑战。	But, because the tool, called CRISPR, can alter entire populations of wild organisms (and thus shared ecosystems), ensuring that these interventions are developed responsibly poses an unprecedented challenge for science and society.
华盛顿—12月12日，美联储主席伯南克宣布美联储将一直保持利率近零水平直至失业率降到6.5 % ， 只要通胀预期保持可控。	WASHINGTON, DC – On December 12, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced that the Fed will keep interest rates at close to zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5%, provided inflation expectations remain subdued.
卡斯帕罗夫尖锐地提出这样一个问题 — — 像Iphone 5这种产品到底提高了我们的什么能力，并指出大多数现代计算机背后的科学原理在上个世纪七十年代就已经解决了。	Kasparov pointedly asked what products such as the iPhone 5 really add to our capabilities, and argued that most of the science underlying modern computing was settled by the seventies.
首先，目前大家普遍的感觉是近期的经济增长只是少数个人从中受益，而随着经济泡沫的破灭，绝大多数人却为此买单。	First, everywhere there is a sense of disgust at the way the recent boom seemed to privatize gains while the subsequent bust socialized losses.
毕竟，正是为了保证这份协议的签署年轻的乌克兰人挺身而出对抗乌克兰前总统亚努科维奇的狙击手，并且现在仍在对抗俄罗斯军队势力。	After all, it was to secure that agreement that young Ukrainians braved former President Viktor Yanukovych’s snipers, and are now braving the might of the Russian army.
这将大大提高我身为俄罗斯人的自尊心，同时也教育美国人 — — 他们的政府老是干预他国内政 — — 从玻璃房子里朝外面扔石头的危险。	It would bolster my self-esteem as a Russian, while educating Americans – whose government has long interfered in other countries’ internal affairs – about the dangers of throwing stones from a glass house.
但国会议员也对特朗普的“基础盘”感到担忧，这些人可能只占选民总数的约1/3，但在共和党国会选区势力却非常强大，可能支持更加右倾的党内初选挑战者。	But the members of Congress also became fearful of Trump’s “base,” which may represent only about a third of the electorate but is very strong in Republican congressional districts and could back a more right-leaning challenger in the party primary.
如果非洲各国政府坦然接受发电和供电方式的多样性，就能为千百万人提供现代能源，同时让非洲位列全球能源转型前沿。	If African governments embrace diversity in the way electricity is generated and distributed, they could provide modern energy to millions of people, while placing the continent at the forefront of a global energy transformation.
如果我们要保全和支持国内外的自由民主，那么在防范新的恐怖袭击的同时了解和避免过去所犯的错误就至关重要。	Preventing new terrorist attacks while understanding and avoiding the mistakes of the past will be essential if we are to preserve and support liberal democracy both at home and abroad.
二战一结束，法国官员莫内（Jean Monnet）和舒曼（Robert Shuman）就提出了建立欧洲政治联盟、成立欧罗巴合众国（United States of Europe）的动议。	It was French officials Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman who launched the initiative for European political union just after World War II with the call for a United States of Europe.
但对于那些支持欧洲央行“以稳定为导向的货币政策 ” （ 这个词暗示其他人无视货币不稳定风险）的人来说，价格稳定目标显然已经变得过于局限。	Yet for those in favor of the ECB’s “stability-oriented monetary policy” – a term suggesting that others disregard the risk of monetary instability – the price-stability objective has evidently become too constraining.
为何目前掌握在国家手中的资源不会成为他们的传家之物？ 比如，在委内瑞拉，前总统查韦斯逝世已经两年多，但其女仍然占据着总统官邸。	Why shouldn’t those currently in control of the state transform it into their patrimony, as in Venezuela, where, more than two years after former President Hugo Chávez’s death, his daughters still occupy the presidential residence?
乌克兰的加入将极大增强欧亚经济联盟的合法性，因此俄罗斯竭尽一切策略 — — 从降低天然气价格到贸易制裁 — — 说服其领导人加入其中。	Given that Ukraine’s participation would significantly enhance the union’s legitimacy, Russia is using all available tactics – from lower gas prices to trade sanctions – to persuade its leaders to join.
人们常常认为，创造货币是国家的事情，这是 19 世纪的主流学说，在德国经济学家克纳普（ Georg Friedrich Knapp ）的著作《国家货币论》中登峰造极。	The creation of money is often thought to be the domain of the state: this was the prevalent doctrine of the nineteenth century, reaching its apogee in the German economist Georg Friedrich Knapp’s The State Theory of Money .
然而，问题的核心在于伊朗政权渴望成为伊斯兰世界的霸权力量和地区大国，从而与世界上最强大国家们平起平坐。	However, at the heart of the issue lies the Iranian regime’s aspiration to become a hegemonic Islamic and regional power and thereby position itself at eye level with the world’s most powerful nations.
但他的政府选择向3,000万委内瑞拉人民而不是华尔街违约这一事实绝非其道德正直的标志，而是其道德破产的信号。	But the fact that his administration has chosen to default on 30 million Venezuelans, rather than on Wall Street, is not a sign of its moral rectitude. It is a signal of its moral bankruptcy.
更为重要的是：联邦政府通过分配更多的额外税收来缓解各州面临的问题（如高失业率）时所扮演的角色，即所谓的“转移联盟 ” ， 让很多德国人深恶痛绝。	Even more important is the federal government’s role in helping states that face, say, high unemployment, by allocating additional tax revenue to them – the so-called “transfer union” so loathed by many Germans.
日本近日出台的新防卫大纲对其军事原则做出了自冷战开始以来的首次修订 — — 这清晰地暗示中国已经成为该国最大的威胁 — — 这意味着中国领导人也是时候仔细审视一下自己的区域性战略了。	Japan’s change of military doctrine for the first time since the start of the Cold War – a shift that implicitly makes China the greatest threat – suggests that the Chinese leadership needs to take a hard look at its regional grand strategy.
而且，政府支出注入了众多颇为有益的项目，正如消费支出能够刺激生产和就业，这些政府支出同样会刺激生产和就业。	For that price, American taxpayers will get an extra $1 trillion of goods and services, and employment will be higher by about ten million job-years.
但是以色列与北约的合作甚至是伙伴关系 — — 某种可能最终导向成员关系的过渡阶段 — — 则是另外一番情形。	Cooperation and even partnership with NATO – an interim stage potentially leading to membership – is another matter.
掌握这一原则的还有伽利略，他指出文艺复兴时期采用成功造船和方尖塔迁移技术的工程师时常惊讶地看到，原有技术在大型船舶和方尖塔的建造过程中常常会以失败告终。	It was also known to Galileo, who noted that Renaissance engineers who followed successful methods of building ships and moving obelisks were often surprised by the spontaneous failures when tried with larger ships and obelisks.
· 传统跨国金融机构提供的伊斯兰资产越来越多，伦敦、卢森堡和其他国际金融中心对伊斯兰金融的兴趣也在增加。	· Conventional multinational financial institutions are increasingly offering Islamic assets, and there is growing interest in them in London, Luxembourg, and other world financial capitals.
在美国，反型脂肪的消费占总能量摄入的2-4 % ， 主要来源是深度油炸的快餐、糕点（包括蛋糕、饼干、松饼、馅饼等 ） 、 包装小食品、人造黄油和面包。	In the US, consumption of trans fats averages between 2-4% of total energy, with major sources being deep fried fast foods, bakery products (cakes, cookies, muffins, pies, etc.), packaged snack foods, margarines, and breads.
米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫在这里也起了重要作用：他对东欧实行不干涉政策，这意味着苏联坦克不能像在布拉格之春中那样，逆转波兰的政治变革。	Mikhail Gorbachev was important; his non-intervention policy toward Eastern Europe meant that Soviet tanks would not annul the changes, as they had done with the Prague Spring.
与美国类似，相当一部分阿根廷、巴西、南非、中国、印度及其他国家的农民 — — 大多只拥有为数很少的农田 — — 也喜欢使用转基因种子，因为这样更划算。	But maybe those who oppose private seed corporations are really against capitalism and the market economy rather than GM seed.
要捍卫这些价值，法国和德国必须合力重新发现和重新发明欧洲社会模式，起点就是最低工资标准、劳动力市场政策、退休和教育等领域的具体措施。	To uphold those values, France and Germany must join forces to rediscover and reinvent Europe’s social model, starting with concrete initiatives in the fields of minimum-wage standards, labor-market policies, retirement, and education.
俄罗斯当前即使不再是一个全球性超级大国，其巨大的石油和天然气储备使它成为一个能源超级大国，而且普京看起来像要打这张牌。	Even though it is no longer a global superpower, Russia’s vast oil and gas reserves make it an energy superpower, and Putin seems intent on playing that card.
与此同时，政府的激励措施正在吸引一直在海外工作的中国科学家回国创业，其中很多人都曾在西方顶级机构工作。	At the same time, government incentives are luring Chinese scientists who have been working abroad – many with top-tier Western institutions – back home.
大学、企业、非政府组织、特别是全球青年中最出色的人才已经做好准备迎接最严峻的挑战，并陆续加盟联合国新的可持续发展方案网络。	The greatest talents in our societies – in universities, businesses, NGOs, and especially among the world’s young people – are ready to take on our greatest challenges, and are joining the UN’s new Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
如果投资者怀疑德国的金融基本面健康状况和决心，欧洲央行行长德拉吉在2012年夏所做出的“竭尽全力”拯救欧元的承诺还会如此有效吗？	Would European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s vow in the summer of 2012 to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro have been nearly as effective if investors doubted Germany’s underlying financial strength and resolve?
塞内加尔的达喀尔巴斯德研究所是全球仅有四家生产黄热病疫苗的机构之一，每年可以生产一千万剂，并且产能极难扩张。	Senegal’s Pasteur Institute of Dakar, one of only four facilities in the world producing yellow fever vaccines, manufactures about ten million doses per year, and the manufacturing process is extremely difficult to scale up.
超过20亿人携带结核病菌，其中约10%的携带者会在某个时点发病，造成每年150万人死亡（与死于近期埃博拉病毒爆发的20，000人形成了鲜明的���照 ） 。	More than two billion people carry the TB bacterium, and at some point about 10% of them will develop the disease, which kills some 1.5 million victims per year (compared to 20,000 dead in the recent Ebola outbreak).
所有这些事件都让土耳其感到不安和无所适从，这些事件并因20世纪30年代以来最严重的全球性经济危机对国内的影响而被放大。	All of these events have disturbed and disoriented Turkey, and are magnified by the domestic impact of worst global economic crisis since the 1930’s.
子贡曰 ： “ 夫子温、良、恭、俭、让以得之 。 ” 那么中国国家总理温家宝又是否能在最近对印度的访问中遵照这部中国古代经典的准则行事呢？	But will Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao live up to that standard, as conveyed in the Analects of Confucius, on his current visit to India?
个人需求差别很大，但是私人保险公司往往不愿投保那些最需要医疗服务的人群（例如那些已经生病的人，或可能会引发其他健康问题的糖尿病患者 ） 。	Individual needs vary significantly, and private companies are often unwilling to insure the very people who need the most care (such as those who are already ill, or who have conditions like diabetes, which predispose them to other health problems).
只有那些来自德国，荷兰或者是芬兰这样的斯堪的纳维亚半岛欧元区国家的人才能得到德国人的支持，这点非常关键。	Only someone from Germany, the Netherlands, or a Scandinavian euro country like Finland can count on support from Germans, which is crucial.
直到最近，许多左倾经济评论家一直在争论美国采取大规模财政刺激的问题，随后在一夜之间就改变了立场（准确地说，就是特朗普当选的那一夜 ） 。	Until recently, many left-leaning economic commentators have been arguing for massive fiscal stimulus in the US, though they seem to have changed their position overnight (the night Trump was elected, to be precise).
但科克伦也指出，这也是一种理论的虚无主义，不能将所有这些价格过度波动都归咎于克鲁格曼所认为的“非理性 ” 。	Cochrane’s heaviest punching is reserved for Krugman’s support for President Barack Obama’s fiscal stimulus.
我的结论是，证明这个动态平衡点存在的一个有力指标是：五年远期石油价格，或是从现在起五年后保证交付每桶石油所支付的金额。	My conclusion is that a good indication of this moving equilibrium does exist: the five-year forward oil price, or the amount paid for guaranteed delivery of oil five years from now.
对那些需要苦苦搜寻不再与特定文化相联的纯粹教条的信奉者，像乌里玛这样的宗教学者恐怕也不会有太大的帮助。	Ulemas (religious scholars) are useless for believers who must search for purely religious criteria that are no longer linked to a given culture.
卢拉治下的把戏实施了家庭补助金（Bolsa Familia）计划，该计划向家庭直接派发现金，将数百万人带出了贫困。	Brazil under Lula implemented Bolsa Familia, a system of direct cash payments to households that is credited with lifting millions out of poverty.
马洪的困难在于，他手里似乎没有一套真心实意的改革方案能提供给朔伊布勒，让后者去说服德国政府接受维护法国和欧元区稳定所需的特定程度顺差回收方案。	Macron’s difficulty is that there seems to be no set of painful reforms that he can offer Schäuble to persuade the German government to accept the degree of surplus recycling necessary to stabilize France and the eurozone.
上述汇款的纯粹金额，以及它们使数百万人避免陷入贫困的重要作用，表明富裕国家政府应仔细审核现有的汇款系统。	The sheer size of these remittances, and their importance in keeping many millions of people above the poverty line, suggests that rich-country governments should take a careful look at the existing system.
尽管德国和日本的确在美国占领之后成为了民主国家，但这需要在摧毁一切的战争中将它们彻底击垮，而后又是长达7年的漫长占领。	While it is true that Germany and Japan became democratic after American occupation, it required their total defeat in a devastating war, and a seven-year occupation.
英国被迫在1919年4月放弃黄金兑换，这是英国准备回到从前一英镑兑换4.8665美元等价的战术性撤退。	The British were forced to abandon gold convertibility in April 1919 – a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for Britain’s return to the former $4.8665 parity with the American dollar.
考虑到如今的经济和财政条件，公共部门投资极有可能在国家预算中被挤出，该计划代表了增长导向型公共部门投资的重大承诺。	Given today’s difficult economic and fiscal conditions, where public-sector investment is likely to be crowded out in national budgets, this program represents a major commitment to growth-oriented public sector investment.
在当前范式下，如哈佛大学的约瑟夫·奈（Joseph Nye）所言，这意味着单方面毁掉美国最重要的“巧”实力源泉。	Under the current paradigm, as argued by Harvard’s Joseph Nye, this would imply the unilateral destruction of America’s most important source of “smart” power.
上海人可能不会谈论伦敦的房价，但是上海的观察评论家们却知道伦敦正在发生什么，而伦敦房价的上涨似乎使上海房价的上涨看起来同样可行而有道理。	People in Shanghai may not talk about London home prices, but Shanghai's opinion leaders know what is happening in London, and the boom there makes it seem plausible that there should be a boom in Shanghai, too.
但有一项关键警告在混乱中被忘记：在危机中奏效的措施未必能给危机后的复苏提供足够动力 — — 特别是如果危机让实体经济陷入资产负债表衰退的话。	But one vital caveat was lost in the commotion: What works during a crisis will not necessarily provide sufficient traction for the post-crisis recovery – especially if the crisis has left the real economy mired in a balance-sheet recession.
虽然最近的丑闻才让中国太子党进入到媒体耀眼的聚光灯下，但他们一直是西方企业炙手可热的目标。 这些企业希望利用其关系获得数十亿美元的交易业务。	While recent scandals have put China’s princelings under a harsh media spotlight, they have been hot commodities for Western companies seeking to capitalize on their guanxi (connections) in order to secure multi-billion dollar transactions.
德国不久前在人均收入领域已经被几个欧盟国家赶超，它们是爱尔兰、英国、荷兰和法国，而增长速度仍然赶不上其中的任何一个。	Germany has recently been overtaken in terms of per capita income by several EU countries, including Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, and France, and is still growing more slowly than all of them.
最后我想强调一下，符合民众和企业实际使用需要的税收规定的相关要点还没有制定出来，并在一定程度上会由未来几个月中出台的技术解释和规定来确定。	Finally, I would emphasize the related point that the actual tax provisions people and businesses will be required to use have yet to be written, and will be determined partly by technical interpretations and regulations in the coming months.
混业经营使金融机构的业务多样化，和商业银行的结合使投资银行可以使用相对稳定的存款而不是变幻无常的货币市场来为其运营提供资金。	Conglomerates allow financial institutions to diversify their business, and combining with commercial banks allows investment banks to fund their operations using relatively stable deposits instead of fickle money markets.
巴黎— 一些经济学家认为，这个夏天将因某些欧元区外围成员国踏上被迫离开之路而被铭记；其他经济学家则认为发生这种情况的可能性极小。	PARIS – Some economists believe that this summer could mark the moment when some of the eurozone’s peripheral members may begin to be forced out; others think that such a scenario is inconceivable.
对世界其他国家来说，很重要的一点是要理解为什么通常沉默寡言的科学界将走出实验室和办公室，走上街头参加一场全球问题的游行。	For the rest of the world, it is important to understand why the usually sedate community of scientists will be leaving their labs and offices to take to the streets in a global demonstration of concern.
美国疾病控制与预防中心确认当今儿童的血液中含有二十年前并不存在的数十种化学物质，其中包括许多已知会导致癌症和一系列其他疾病的破坏基因的化合物。	America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirm that children’s blood today contains dozens of chemicals that did not exist two decades earlier, including many gene-damaging compounds known to cause cancer and a host of other diseases.
毕竟，中国的发展战略依赖于继续融入世界经济 — — 具体而言，依赖于可靠的获得美国市场和技术的方式。	After all, China’s development strategy depends on its continued integration into the world economy – and, specifically, reliable access to American markets and technology.
西方需要在反对该政权残酷统治的同时与其民众培养感情并投资于该国经济，如果私有化进程顺利的话这一切都将更容易推行。	The West needs to cultivate relations with these people and invest in the economy, while rejecting the brutality of the regime, which may become easier if privatization moves ahead.
最后，请留意这起案件与乌克兰和其他地区的危机是一致的，就是美国大部分的强制行动都是对俄罗斯进行金融和经济制裁，而俄罗斯也是依然受到威胁的最大国家。	Finally, bear in mind that the case coincided with the crises in Ukraine and elsewhere, with the major US enforcement action being financial and economic sanctions on Russia, the largest of which are still being threatened.
巴黎峰会很可能是一场老套的外交战，各国为争夺支持其兑现缓解和适应气候变化承诺的拨款而在外交上打得头破血流。	The Paris summit is likely to be a buttoned-down diplomatic battle among countries for grants to support their pledges to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
与此同时，法国参议院（法国立法机关由参议院和国民议会两院组成）这座在两次大战之间以及战后时期一直牢不可破的保守派壁垒也在2011年年末有史以来第一次落入了社会党多数派之手。	Meanwhile, the Senate, the French parliament’s upper house, a conservative bastion between the two world wars and ever since, swung to a Socialist majority for the first time in history at the end of 2011.
这不是字面意义上的“西方 ” ： 尽管欧洲和美国是它的核心地带，但它也包括像澳大利亚和日本这样遥远的国家。	It was not literally “west”: while its heartland was Western Europe and the United States, it also included faraway countries like Australia and Japan.
"至于欧盟，它必须选择想成为封闭的""基督教俱乐部 "" ， 还是开放、包容的社会，从文化和宗教的多元性中汲取力量。"	"As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a closed ""Christian club"" or an open and inclusive society, drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity."
为什么目前的政策如此差劲？ 原因之一就是：如果国家能以合理的价格购买资产的话，我们早就是至少一家大型银行的股东了。	Bad terms mean a large national debt in the future. One reason we may be getting bad terms is that if we got fair value for our money, we would by now be the dominant shareholder in at least one of the major banks.
接下来我会听到令人神往的故事，比如在自家门廊上观赏壮观的海上落日、山坡上大片大片五颜六色的野花，以及幽静美丽的环境中快乐的家庭团聚（此外还有各式各样的管道问题 ） 。	I then find myself entertained by stories of gorgeous ocean sunsets seen from the porch, views onto expanses of colorful wildflowers on mountainsides, and happy family reunions in beautiful seclusion (as well as problems with the plumbing).
在这个全球范围内、网络攻击日渐高发的时代，美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿采取了正确的做法，她宣布对一国计算机网络所实施的攻击 “将是对全体的攻击 ” 。	At a time when cyber attacks are increasing worldwide, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was right to declare that an attack on one nation’s computer networks “can be an attack on all.”
七十年前，日本被夷为平地，每个月，美国公民都会给我们的孩子们寄送或带来儿童牛奶、温暖的毛衣甚至山羊等礼物。	Seventy years ago, Japan had been reduced to ashes, and each and every month, citizens of the United States sent and brought gifts like milk for our children, warm sweaters, and even goats.
积极的政策也帮助以色列在20世纪90年代初吸引了近一百万苏联犹太人，这相当于以色列人口的12 % 。	Activist policies were also behind the almost one million Soviet Jews that Israel attracted in the early 1990s, representing 12% of the Israeli population.
如果民粹主义散布恐慌导致各国采取保护主义排斥政策，对全球经济 — — 以及全世界数百万人的生活 — — 的影响将是灾难性的。	If populist fear-mongering drives their countries to embrace exclusionary, protectionist policies, the effect on the global economy – and the livelihoods of millions of people around the world – would be disastrous.
与逐渐退出的一代领导人相比，巴沙尔·阿萨德、阿卜杜拉国王和加麦尔·穆巴拉克 — — 病痛缠身的埃及总统的儿子 — — 这一代政治人物的形象并没有那么一致。	The political generation of Bashar al-Assad, King Abdullah, and Gamal Mubarak – son of Egypt’s ailing president – forms a less coherent picture than that of the outgoing leadership.
失败者或许只是少数，但他们可以联合起来提高自己的呼声并最大限度地提升自身议价能力，特别是这些人在地理上集中分布的情况下。	The losers may be a minority, but they can band together to amplify their voice and maximize their bargaining power, especially if they are geographically concentrated.
经济、政治和社会联系，而非地理联系，决定着这一近邻的边界一直处于变化中，包括了从美国到中国再到其他新兴国家和非国家行动方的各个欧洲最重要的合作伙伴。	Economic, political, and social ties, not geography, determine this neighborhood’s ever-shifting borders, within which are Europe’s most important partners, from the United States to China to other emerging countries and non-state actors.
2010年生效的宪法第18次修改案是为了这一目的，但具体的实施却被那些倾向于中央高度集权的党派拖延了。	The 18th amendment to the constitution, adopted in 2010, does precisely that, but implementation is being delayed by parties that prefer a highly centralized political structure.
在这个例子中，清算所消除了三家机构的对手方风险，但只是将风险转移给了花旗银行，后者原本只损失5000万美元，现在，所有的1亿美元损失都要由它来承担。	The clearinghouse here eliminates counterparty risk for these three, but only by transferring the risk to Citibank, which, instead of losing $50 million, ends up losing the full $100 million.
历史上从未有过这样的先例：一个民族从一片土地上缺失2000年之后又重新回归，他们也从未停止过将这片领土视为自己的祖国。	There is no other example of a nation that returned after a 2,000-year absence to a territory that it never stopped regarding as its homeland.
与此同时，我们还有能力采取行动帮助灾区人民。 他们得到疏散，而且超过200个的医疗组织参与对居民进行放射性污染测试。	Meanwhile we were still able to take measures in helping people within the disaster zone; they were evacuated, and more than 200 medical organizations were involved in testing the population for radiation poisoning.
当一个国家专门从事于某一个领域之时，资本和劳力就会比其他领域更快地流向这一领域。 事实上，出口相关部门的增长的副作用是其他领域的下降。	When a country specializes in a certain area, capital and labor move into that area at a rate faster than they move into other areas – indeed, the growth of export-related sectors may come at the cost of a decline in other areas.
此外，我们还缺乏一个IMF的保险机制，这个机制附带可接受的条款。 缺乏这一机制已经成了全球金融架构中的主要缺陷，对于更加生气勃勃的新兴市场经济来说尤其如此。	In addition, the absence of an IMF insurance facility with acceptable terms has been a major gap in the global financial architecture, especially for the more dynamic emerging-market economies.
顶层设计类似于计算机操作系统，需要合理安排所有软硬组件，达到系统兼容及完整。 许多现代经济体都已经拥有这种顶层治理结构。	This top-level governance architecture is analogous to a computer’s operating system, which orchestrates the other software and hardware components to form a holistic unity.
事实上，当今世界老龄化速度最快的国家是韩国，该国于1999年趋向老龄化，预计将于2017年实现老龄化、并于2027年步入超级老龄化行列。	Indeed, today the world’s most rapidly aging country is South Korea, which became an aging society in 1999, is expected to become an aged one in 2017, and will be a super-aged one in 2027.
穆沙拉夫现在迫不及待地想要祈求、盗取或者借用任何他能够得到的政治合法性，这包括从两位他所流放的文官政治领导人那里获得。	Musharraf is now desperate to beg, steal, or borrow any political legitimacy he can get – including from the two civilian political leaders he exiled.
但是，不管银行联盟能带来多少好处 — — 的确能带来不少好处 — — 成立这样一个联盟会引起目前无法回答的问题。	But, whatever the merits of a banking union – and there are many – proposals to establish one raise more questions than can currently be answered.
任何美元价格的变动都会影响到他们的成本结构和盈利能力，从而进一步影响他们在勘探、研发和维护方面的再投资，	Any change in the value of the dollar therefore affects their cost structure and profitability. In turn, it affects reinvestment in exploration, development, and maintenance.
比如我以前的同事乔伊斯，他丈���是个铁杆曼联球迷，而且每个球季至少要为球队的失利砸烂家里一件家具。	For instance, Joyce, my former workmate, has a husband who is a diehard Manchester United fan. Every season, he breaks at least one piece of furniture when his team loses.
所有各相关利益方参与持续对话至关重要，系统性思考想象力亦然，一定要超越个别国家自身的短期制度和国家考虑因素。	The engagement of all stakeholders in sustained dialogue will be crucial, as will the imagination to think systemically, and beyond one’s own short-term institutional and national considerations.
在成为只不过是换上另一张标签的布什政府的延续的海报女郎时，佩林显示出她自己与贝隆夫人或者丹麦的反移民运动领袖柯丝高这些老于世故的伪民粹主义者有相当多的共同点。	In becoming the poster girl for a re-branded continuation of the Bush administration, Palin is showing herself to have much in common with glossy faux-populists like Eva Peron or Denmark’s anti-immigrant leader Pia Kjærsgaard.
首先，过去25年来社会不平等现象在西方迅速恶化，这部分归因于苏联解体后，扩张共产主义的威胁也随之消失。	First, social inequality has grown unabated in the West over the last quarter-century, owing in part to the disappearance of the Soviet Union and, with it, the threat of expansionist communism.
人们似乎十分欣赏他用例子和行动，而不是用教皇通谕教导众人的偏好 — — 协调在第二次梵蒂冈公会问题上立场对立的两位教皇就是明证。	People seem to appreciate his preference for teaching by example and dramatic gesture – exemplified by his canonization of the rival stars of Vatican II – rather than by encyclical.
写下最低数字的人，能够额外获得2美元作为诚实的奖赏，而写的数字超过最低数字的人，将被扣去2美元作为作弊的惩罚。	Whoever wrote the lowest number would receive an additional $2, as a reward for honesty, while anyone who wrote a higher number would receive $2 less, as a penalty for cheating.
纽约联储行长拥有联邦公开市场委员会永久投票资格并自动成为副主席；而其他地区联储行长只能轮流拥有投票权。	The president of the New York Fed is a permanent voting member and vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, whereas other regional Fed presidents are voting members only on a rotating basis.
这不仅使美国内部分裂加重，而且造成了美国与世界各国矛盾不断，人们都认为我们的政策高压横暴、独断专行。	This has left the US not only deeply divided, but also at loggerheads with much of the rest of the world, which considers our policies high-handed and arbitrary.
由我主持的智库新美国（New America）建立了一个数据库，共发现来自25个西方国家的466名个人离开家乡来到叙利亚。	New America, the think tank I head, has compiled a database on 466 individuals from 25 Western countries who have left their homes to go to Syria.
出租车司机和饭店所有者也许会感到威胁，但共享经济有可能在陷入贫困和不平等陷阱的城市增加收入、改变收入分配。	Taxi drivers and hotel owners may feel threatened, but the sharing economy has the potential to increase and redistribute earnings in cities that are already struggling with poverty and inequality.
据称全球化意味着国家再也不能掌控自己的内部事务，而是必须与其它国家联合，结成像欧盟、东盟或南方共同市场那样的组织。	Globalization, it is said, means that nations can no longer control their own affairs.
即便是悲观的情景也表明，到2050年这一成本只会上升到1.8 % ； 而在乐观情境中，军事成本将进一步下降到GDP的1.6 % 。	Even a pessimistic outlook suggests an increase only to about 1.8% by 2050; under a more optimistic scenario, military costs could decline further, to 1.6% of GDP.
的确，工会的本职工作就在于他们了解一个确定的劳方群体特殊问题，为解决这些问题提供专家的意见，并通过这种方法来代表劳方的利益。	Indeed, the essence of labor unions is that they know the unique problems of a distinct group of workers, bring focused expertise on these problems, and thus intelligently represent their interests.
成文规则 — — 强调合乎道德的业务行为的商业价值以及在这方面落于人后的消极影响 — — 是工作的一部分，有助于保护和强化文化，但光靠规则是不够的。	A written code – emphasizing the commercial benefits of ethical business conduct, and the negative consequences of falling short – is part of that effort and may help preserve and strengthen a culture; but a code alone is not enough.
巴黎 — — “如果法律做出这种假设 ” ， 《雾都孤儿》中的班布尔先生说 ， “ 那法律就是混蛋、白痴 。 ”	PARIS – “If the law supposes that,” says Mr. Bumble in Oliver Twist, “the law is a ass – a idiot.”
纽约—巴勒斯坦不再是一个“实体 ” ， 而是一个国家 — — 确切地说，是联合国非成员观察员国，和梵蒂冈一样。	NEW YORK – Palestine is no longer an “entity,” but a state – or, to be precise, a non-member observer state of the United Nations, just like the Holy See.
中国也逐渐质疑印度对阿鲁纳恰尔邦（位于印度东北面，中国称为“藏南”地区）所拥有的主权并宣称该地区大部分属于中国。	China also has increasingly questioned India’s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh, the northeastern Indian state that China’s rulers call “Southern Tibet” and claim largely as their own.
1.6%的人均年增长率意味着今天出生的一个婴儿在30岁的时候实际收入要比其父母同龄时要高30 % 。	An annual per capita growth rate of 1.6% means that a child born today will have a real income that, on average, is 60% higher at age 30 than his or her parents had at the same age.
无论他个人信仰什么，只要佩纳·聂托能获胜，他就将成为革命制度党首位民主选举的总统 — — 也是该党首位并非由前任指定，而是因为得票更多而当选的国家元首。	Whatever his personal beliefs, if Peña Nieto wins, he will be the PRI’s first-ever democratically elected president – the first to become head of state because he won more votes at the polls, not because his predecessor hand-picked him.
在2003年，时任美联储主席的本·伯南克认为面临通缩的日本应当增加公共支出或者减税，并通过印钞而非发行债券的方式来为这些措施注入资金。	In 2003, then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued that Japan, facing deflation, should increase public expenditure or cut taxes, funding the operation by printing money rather than issuing bonds.
今天，实际上每个拉丁美洲和加勒比的孩子都上小学，并且绝大部分孩子会完成几年的中学教育，与半个世纪以前相比这是一个令人瞩目的进步。	Today, virtually every Latin American and Caribbean child enrolls in primary school, and most complete several years of secondary education – remarkable progress compared to a half-century ago.
现任美国在伊监狱助理主管的约翰•J•阿姆斯特朗从上一职位退休时与所在监狱发生的两桩非正常死亡诉讼有牵连。	John J. Armstrong, now the assistant director of operations for US prisons in Iraq, resigned from his previous post when he was named in two wrongful death lawsuits at one of those prisons.
纽约—从1981年到2016年，艾滋病夺走了大约3,600万人的生命，目前还有同样数量的人携带艾滋病毒。	NEW YORK – The AIDS pandemic claimed around 36 million lives between 1981 and 2016, and a similar number around the world currently live with the HIV virus.
但这两股主要政治力量最近几年在西班牙都难觅踪迹，西班牙公民党（Ciudadanos）和社会民主力量党（Pedomos）几乎没有右倾极权主义的倾向，也从来不大放反欧厥词。	Yet neither of the two major political forces that have emerged in Spain in recent years, Ciudadanos and Podemos, has so much as a whiff of right-wing authoritarian tendencies, nor anti-European bombast.
今天，抛弃欧元重新引入本国货币至少需要几周时间，而1931年英国利用周末市场不开盘的时间就能让英镑脱离黄金。	Reintroducing national currencies today would take weeks, at a minimum, whereas Britain in 1931 could take sterling off gold while the markets were closed for the weekend.
事实上，反对一项新法案的大规模示威已经迫使波兰政府收回立法提案。 该法案将禁止几乎一切堕胎行为（堕胎行为将导致最多五年刑期的处罚 ） 。	In fact, huge protests against a recent bill that would have banned virtually all abortions (under penalty of imprisonment for up to five years) forced the government to back down and withdraw the proposed legislation.
重要的还有取悦那些编辑，这样你的文章就可以占据更好的位置。 最后还不要忘记取悦信息渠道，这样他们就会不断地向你爆料。	So does pleasing your editors so that they’ll give your stories better placement, and pleasing your sources so that they’ll keep talking to you.
其支持者所提出的更现实的理由包括这会激起人们对欧洲身份的认同感、成立单一欧洲央行可以作为各国政府移交权力的先声等。	More realistically, advocates of a single currency reasoned that it would cause people to identify as Europeans, and that the shift to a single European Central Bank would herald a shift of power away from national governments.
这场法德战争的核心是两个R之间的碰撞：德国坚持要公正（rectitude ） ， 而法国则更想要再分配（redistribution ） 。	At the heart of this Franco-German war is the clash between two Rs: the German commitment to rectitude versus the French penchant for redistribution.
如果 关键要素的供应受到限制或者气候不稳定，价格会大副急剧上升，工业生产和消费者开支将会下降，全球经济增长将会放缓，或许会急剧放缓。	If the supply of vital inputs is constrained or the climate destabilized, prices will rise sharply, industrial production and consumer spending will fall, and world economic growth will slow, perhaps sharply.
而右翼方面，希拉克对萨尔科奇的敌意会在一定阶段导致另一位候选人的出现，这个人可能是国防部长米谢勒·阿利奥·马里（Michele Alliot-Marie ） ， 也可能就是希拉克本人。	On the right, Chirac’s antagonism toward Sarkozy makes it that another candidate will appear at some point, either Michele Alliot-Marie, the defense minister, or Chirac himself.
如今，美国又一次走上了这条路，将和一个拥有核武器的对手发生碰撞，这种状态将一直保持下去，直到其他国家、其他美国领导人以及公众观点把这条路堵死。	The US is on this path again, heading for a collision with a nuclear-armed adversary, and it will remain on it unless other countries, other American leaders, and public opinion block the way.
我们可以想象一下如果某北约成员国就俄罗斯在其境内发动克里米亚式的秘密军事行动而发出警报，北约将采取什么样的行动。	Imagine what would happen if a NATO member state sounded the alarm about Russia launching a secretive Crimea-style military operation within its borders.
华盛顿 — — 2月，埃及革命推翻了独裁者，但埃及是否能够成为一个正常运转的稳定民主国家还远未尘埃落定。	WASHINGTON, DC – Egypt’s revolution toppled a dictator in February, but the country’s future as a stable, functioning democracy remains uncertain.
但个别国家将倾向于采取干预和各种经济政策捍卫均衡汇率，甚至会有更极端的情况，形成国际当局允许贸易伙伴采取激进的干预措施以增强稳定性。	But individual countries would orient intervention and economic policies toward defending the equilibrium rate, or, more radically, an international authority might authorize aggressive intervention by trading partners to promote consistency.
此外，新的援助基金欧洲稳定性机制的贷款能力也被限制在7000亿欧元，只相当于可能需要财政援助国家总公债水平的几分之一。	Moreover, the lending capacity of the new rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, is capped at €700 billion ($905.6 billion), which represents only a fraction of the total public debt of the countries potentially needing financial assistance.
以公共卫生和立法为手段的不同战略的支持者（哥伦比亚总统桑托斯、危地马拉总统莫利纳和其他人）正在赢得支持。	Proponents of a different strategy (Presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Otto Peréz Molina of Colombia and Guatemala, respectively, among others), based on public-health premises and legalization, are gaining ground.
他成立了和平部队（Peace Props）和与拉丁美洲的进步联盟（Alliance for Progress）等计划；他开启了探月计划，并在20世纪60年代末实现登月。	He established programs like the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and he set the United States on a path to landing a man on the moon by the end of the 1960’s.
此外，中国谴责美国对被发现与朝鲜进行违法交易的中国公司和个人采取“二级制裁 ” ， 认为这侵犯了中国的主权。	Moreover, China condemns “secondary sanctions” placed by the US on Chinese companies and individuals found to have illicit dealings with North Korea as assaults on its sovereignty.
不过人们在市场交易中作恶的想法对各大商品市场，商品期货交易委员会或洲际交易所公司来说也不是什么新闻。	But the idea that people may behave badly in market transactions is nothing new to commodity markets, to the CFTC, or to ICE.
而在阿根廷方面，另一家美国法院允许一小撮所谓秃鹫基金去阻挠破坏一项得到该国92.4％的债权人同意的重组进程。	In the case of Argentina, another US court allowed a small minority of so-called vulture funds to jeopardize a restructuring process to which 92.4% of the country’s creditors had agreed.
摩洛哥改善国家福祉的渐进方针 — — 从十多年前开始悄然但坚决地开始了政治、经济和社会改革 — — 基础是压倒多数的公民支持。	Morocco’s evolutionary approach to improving the country’s well-being – quietly and resolutely building on the political, economic, and social reforms launched more than a decade ago – is backed by an overwhelming majority of citizens.
此外还将包括强化民间投资激励机制的一系列改革措施和解决劳动力市场结构性失衡及潜在破坏性收入不平等的包容性议程问题。	It would also include a variety of reforms to strengthen private investment incentives. And it would include an inclusiveness agenda directed at structural disequilibrium in labor markets and potentially destructive income inequality.
换句话说，病人可以也应该不在只充当被动的“患者 ” ， 而是积极参与，给医生、研究者和药物研发者不适应就淘汰的压力。	In other words, patients can and should stop being the passive “sick” and actively engage to pressure clinicians, researchers, and drug developers to adapt or perish.
换句话说，经济回报的摆锤已经彻底偏离了劳动者而摆向资本所有者一方 — — 这对那些鼓吹要将美国企业从所谓重压下解放出来的人来说可不是个好论据。	In other words, the pendulum of economic returns has swung decisively away from labor toward owners of capital – not exactly a compelling argument in favor of relief for purportedly hard-pressed American businesses.
首相桑切斯的西班牙社会工人党（Socialist Workers’ Party）是PP的镜像，放弃了菲利普·冈萨雷斯（Felipe González）的中间道路遗产，只为与极左翼民粹主义的我们可以党（Podemos）一争高下。	Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party is the PP’s mirror image, having abandoned the centrist legacy of Felipe González in order to compete with the far-left populists of Podemos.
更糟糕的是，投资协定让公司能够因为完全合理合规的变化起诉政府 — — 比如当某香烟公司利润因为监管规则限制烟草的使用而利润下降时。	Worse, investment agreements enable companies to sue the government over perfectly sensible and just regulatory changes – when, say, a cigarette company’s profits are lowered by a regulation restricting the use of tobacco.
虽然贝卢斯科尼（已被禁止参选）和格里罗都已经选择直面贫穷问题，但他们提出的解决方案只不过是短期修复。	While Berlusconi (who is barred from running for office) and Grillo have homed in on the problem of poverty, their proposed solutions are nothing more than short-term fixes.
国民城市银行和大通银行（Chase National Bank）在此前已经宣布正在遣散其证券业务部门。	National City Bank and Chase National Bank had already announced that they were liquidating their securities affiliates.
通过让国外的低工资工人 — — 和越来越多的机器 — — 承担更多工作，技术已经使得“最高工资天花板”得以加强。	By enabling lower-wage workers abroad – and, increasingly, machines – to do more jobs, technology has reinforced this “maximum wage ceiling.”
欧盟成员国无法就如何捍卫外部边境形成一致，更不用说如何处置已经到达的难民了，因此，形成有效统一的应对措施难上加难。	With EU member states failing to agree on how to secure external borders, much less what to do with the refugees who have already arrived, an effective, unified response has proved elusive.
过去的两代人见证了独立的中央银行的崛起。 它们的货币政策在很大程度上与宗派主义的政治绝缘，而是以就业和与物价稳定一致的购买力的最大化为目标。	The past two generations have witnessed the rise of independent central banks whose monetary policy, largely insulated from partisan politics, aims for the maximum possible employment and purchasing power consistent with price stability.
二十二年前，联合国气候变化框架公约（Framework Convention on Climate Change，UNFCCC）诞生；如今，195个国家同意通过限制全球升温幅度在2℃内以防止危险的全球变暖。	Twenty-two years ago, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was unveiled; today, 195 countries have agreed to prevent dangerous global warming by limiting the increase in global temperature to 2⁰C.
这些城市包括巴西利亚（20世纪50年代 ） 、 堪培拉（20世纪10年代 ） 、 伊斯兰堡(20世纪60年代 ) ， 新德里（20世纪60年代）和华盛顿（20世纪50年代 ） 。	These include Brasilia (1950’s), Canberra (1910’s), Islamabad (1960’s), New Delhi (1910’s), and Washington DC (1790’s). In each of these cases, a planner built the whole city infrastructure to make it a cohesive, attractive place.
美国的民主制度为其重视短期成果的习惯付出了沉重的代价：减税与不断增加的福利支出带来了长期财政赤字，以致未来几代人都必须为过去几十年的过度消费买单。	American democracy’s emphasis on short time horizons is costly, with tax cuts and increased welfare benefits giving rise to chronic fiscal deficits, with future generations forced to foot the bill for years of excessive consumption.
而这里就涉及到指导欧元区治理改革的最重要原则：任何变革都必须与加强各国间涉及风险分担决策合法性的政治改革一道进行。	And herein lies the most important principle that must guide eurozone governance reform: changes must be pursued alongside political reforms that strengthen the legitimacy of decisions involving risk sharing among countries.
这一专长是具有全球竞争力的金融机构所拥有的最为宝贵的资产。 但是，在利用这一专长之前，投资者需要控制与其利益相关的公司的运作。	But to use that expertise – the most valuable asset a globally competitive financial institution has – investors need to control the operations of firms in which they have a stake.
这个问题的政治面和经济面几乎可以保证英国选民将支持保留欧盟成员资格，尽管民调要等到公决前几周甚至几天才会表现出来。	The politics and economics of the question virtually guarantee that British voters will back EU membership, even though this may not become apparent in public opinion polls until a few weeks, or even days, before the vote.
但我们仍需就开辟充满活力的新低碳经济道路做出重要决策，上述经济必须能够支撑长期快速发展和日益繁荣的全球民众。	Yet important decisions remain to be made in charting a course toward a new and dynamic low-carbon economy, one capable of supporting a fast-growing and increasingly prosperous global population in the long term.
伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）毫无疑问是2016年总统候选人当中思想最为新潮的，也是千禧一代选民心中的英雄，他已经75岁了。	Bernie Sanders, certainly the freshest mind of all the 2016 presidential candidates and the hero of millennial voters, is 75.
显而易见，我们的数据表明制衣业并没有兑现它们的承诺（虽然孟加拉国政府声称服装加工企业目前“不存在雇用童工”的现象 ） 。	Clearly, our data suggest that the industry’s promises have yet to be fulfilled (though the government of Bangladesh claims that there currently is “no child labor” in garment processing units).
像保罗·霍肯这样的环保主义者相信教育 — — 特别是女童教育 — — 是应对气候变化的最有效步骤一点都不足为奇。	It is no surprise that environmentalists like Paul Hawken believe that education – and educating girls in particular – is among the most effective steps the world can take to combat climate change.
事实上，就算真能达成这样的分工，摧毁伊斯兰国在伊拉克和叙利亚区域基地的地面行动也只能逼迫其撤到无人区。	Indeed, even if such a division of labor could be agreed, a ground invasion that denies ISIS its territorial base in Iraq and Syria would merely push it to redeploy in a region that is collapsing into various no man’s lands.
这种方法还挑起城市管理者和环保主义者之间的矛盾，后者要求限制兴修水利，以缓解对森林和流域造成的压力。	It also puts city managers at odds with environmentalists, who campaign for restrictions on development to ease pressure on forests and watersheds.
选择性保护、信用补贴、国有企业、本土生产规则以及技术转移要求都在中国成为制造业强国的过程中居功至伟。	Selective protection, credit subsidies, state-owned enterprises, domestic-content rules, and technology-transfer requirements have all played a role in making China the manufacturing powerhouse that it is.
原因很简单，与其他地区相比，大湾区的市场导向要强烈得多，香港和澳门的对外开放程度比其他中国城市高很多。	The reason is simple: the GBA is far more market-oriented than its counterparts, with Hong Kong and Macau much more open to the outside world than any other Chinese cities.
欧元分崩离析会彻底破坏欧盟共同市场，只剩下两大阵营的相互敌视和不信任，从而致使欧洲比欧盟成立以前的情况还要糟糕。	If the euro breaks up in disarray, the common market and the EU will be destroyed, leaving Europe worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began, owing to a legacy of mutual mistrust and hostility.
为此塞齐亚罗特，以及来自罗马尼亚，保加利亚和希腊的政治人物都向欧洲委员会和欧洲安全与合作组织提出了抗议。	Szijjarto, along with his counterparts from Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece, also voiced opposition to the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
1923年，他的呼吁变成了警告，当下的决策者们想必会认真留心到 ： “ 契约绝对论者 … … 才是真正的革命孕育者 。 ”	And, in 1923, his call became a warning that today’s policymakers would do well to heed: “The absolutists of contract…are the real parents of revolution.”
韩国出口的萎靡需要仔细的跟踪分析，既要追踪其他主要经济体的贸易数据，也要看韩国的7月数据（将在8月1日发布 ） 。	The weakening of South Korean exports calls for careful follow-up analysis, both of other major economies’ trade data and of South Korea’s July data, when it is published on August 1.
除此之外，新一届法塔赫领导层所面临的另一个主要挑战则是其领导人能否既在组织内担任领导职务，又巴勒斯坦当局内担任部长级官员的问题。	Another major challenge facing the new Fatah leadership will be how it deals with the duality of holding party posts while also holding ministerial positions within the Palestinian Authority.
伊斯兰堡 - - 当巴基斯坦准备2月18日的议会选举之际，许多观察家希望这一次投票将会通过给予政府合法性而迎来平稳的时期。	ISLAMABAD -- As Pakistan gears up for its parliamentary election on February 18, many observers hope that the vote will usher in a period of stability and calm by lending popular legitimacy to the government.
） 。 但是，没有共同的文化规范作为与（比如）如何实现福祉或如何引导生活等问题有关的决定的基础，我们如何区分好选择与坏选择？	But, with no shared cultural norms on which to base decisions regarding, say, how to achieve wellbeing or to direct one’s life, how can one distinguish between good and bad choices?
但他巧妙地运用硬实力并以此在叙利亚达成了一系列具体且可实现的目标，使得俄罗斯成为了中东地区各重要势力的焦点 — — 也对美国构成了严重的地缘政治挑战。	But his smart use of hard power to achieve specific, achievable objectives in Syria has made Russia a focal point for the major actors in the Middle East – creating a serious geopolitical challenge for the US.
埃塞俄比亚，加纳，肯尼亚和塞内加尔都融入了全球园艺价值链，而埃塞俄比亚也已晋身为全球花卉出口的主要参与者。	Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal are all integrated into global horticultural value chains, and Ethiopia has become a leading player in global flower exports.
事实上，此人在民族主义反对派阵营中根本没什么地位，车臣叛军中也没几个人会把他当指挥官看待；而他最近派遣密使，试图组建一支由自己指挥的武装力量的举动也最终宣告失败。	His position in the nationalist opposition was weak. There seem to be few, if any, fighters in Chechnya who recognize him as commander; his recent attempt to send an emissary to create a fighting unit directly under his command was not successful.
简言之，中国必须认真考虑当前新兴经济体所面临的资产危机，特别是如果它想实现人民币完全可兑换和国际化的话。	In short, China must take into consideration the ongoing asset crisis facing emerging economies, especially when considering highly consequential questions such as full renminbi convertibility and the currency’s internationalization.
这正是在今年的八国峰会上启动海利根达姆进程的动因，它第一次使八国的领导人以及世界主要的新兴经济体，包括中国、印度、巴西、墨西哥和南非的领导人走到了一起。	This was what inspired the Heiligendamm Process launched at this year’s G-8 Summit, which for the first time brought G-8 leaders together with leaders of the world’s major emerging economies, including China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.
但金有义务提醒他和美国国会 — — 恰恰是共和党总统乔治·W·布什创造性地成功支持了抗击艾滋病的战斗。	But it is Kim’s job to remind him and the US Congress of those obligations – and that it was a Republican president, George W. Bush who creatively and successfully pursued the battle against AIDS.
但有一种因素可能将所有因素联系在一起：巴切莱特有权而且可能在 2013 － 2014 年再次竞选总统。	One factor, however, may hold everything together: Bachelet can and may run again for president in 2013-2014.
他们没有表现出团结一致，反而进行道德说教，似乎欧洲地中海地区的所有问题都是其国民懒惰或腐败的本性造成的。	Instead of showing solidarity, they moralize, as though all of the problems in Mediterranean Europe were the result of native laziness or its citizens’ corrupt nature.
今天，因为法国领导了保护利比亚民众免受其领袖侵害的国际斗争，他们可以同时为自己的法国和阿拉伯身份感到骄傲。	And today, with France taking the lead in an international effort to protect the Libyan people from their leader, they can feel simultaneously proud of being French and of their Arab roots.
俄罗斯和中国在向应该受到指责和制裁的政府施压方面持保留态度，部分原因就在于此；叙利亚问题无法形成一致只是结果之一。	Russian and Chinese reticence about pressuring governments that deserve censure and sanction stems partly from such concerns; the absence of consensus on Syria is just one result.
以色列如何面对全球对于否认在以色列和巴勒斯坦全境的巴勒斯坦人与以色列犹太人拥有同样的政治权利所隐含的事实种族隔离机制的日益强烈的反对？	How will Israel address intensifying global opposition to the de facto apartheid regime implied by denying Palestinians throughout Israel and Palestine the same political rights as Israeli Jews?
以色列有些人，比如外交部长阿维格多·利伯曼，似乎想要无视《奥斯陆协议 》 （ 和实现两国解决方案的希望）彻底切断加沙同西岸的联系，并将加沙推向埃及。	Some in Israel, such as Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, seem to want to cut off Gaza completely from the West Bank, in contravention of the Oslo accords (and the prospect of a two-state solution!), and push it in the direction of Egypt.
家庭形成速度的下降 — — 比如，年青一代美国人越来越多地搬回家去和父母同住 — — 抑制了房价，导致了更多的人被剥夺了按揭权。	Decreased rates of household formation – young Americans, for example, are increasingly moving back in with their parents – depress housing prices, leading to still more foreclosures.
除非这项事业得到充分的理解，而且所有的来龙去脉在地区内尽人皆知，否则今后的事态发展可能证明这次袭击只是南亚分裂过程的开始。	Unless this cause is fully understood, and its roots revealed across the region, this attack may prove to be the beginning of the unmaking of South Asia.
并且由于它价格更低，比削减碳排放更加简单可行，这对于达成一个真心诚意而且得到广泛支持 — — 并因此成功实现 — — 的国际条约来说也是一个更好的机遇。	And, because it would be cheaper and easier than carbon cuts, there would be a much greater chance of reaching a genuine, broad-based – and thus successful – international agreement.
向中国，印度，欧洲和美国出口原材料是非洲最近经济飙升的一个关键因素，但这种出口可能受挫，因为全球经济下滑意味着每个地区都会减少消费。	And exports of raw materials to China, India, Europe, and the US – a key factor in Africa’s recent growth surge – may suffer simply because the global slowdown means less consumption everywhere.
空气污染就像一颗定时炸弹：全球微粒浓度最高的的15个城市中有14个在印度，彰显出转向低碳电池驱动交通工具的紧迫性。	Air pollution is a ticking bomb: 14 of the 15 cities with the world’s highest concentrations of fine particulate matter are in India, underscoring the urgency of switching to low-carbon, battery-powered vehicles.
最终被命名为“精神病学”的首个医疗专业和“精神失常”等新名词应运而生，此外还有关于“精神失常”的特殊立法。	It called into being a new term, “madness,” the first medical specialization (eventually named “psychiatry”), and special legislation regarding the “mad.”
只有少得可怜的一些内省展示了我们在回答“我是谁”这个问题上的困难，这个问题源于我们在区别我们众多的身份和理解它们的架构时所面临的复杂性。	Only a minimum of introspection shows that our difficulty in answering the question, Who am I?, arises from the complexity we face in distinguishing between our many identities and understanding their architecture.
在二战结束后的几十年里，当时的反犹情绪比现在更为普及，偏见较深的人实际在辨认犹太人照片方面更加准确。	In the decades immediately after World War II, when anti-Semitism was even more widespread than it is today, people with deeper prejudices were actually more accurate in identifying Jewish people in pictures.
俄罗斯还有更进一步的打算，认为一国不能为了自己的安全而损坏他国利益。 到底由谁来定义什么是“损坏”目前还不清楚。	Europe should react to this Russian proposal, first, by acknowledging that Russia has a critical role to play in transatlantic security, and that it should be treated not only with caution, but also with respect.
与后苏联世界的其他国家一样，格鲁吉亚所面临的不幸悖论是：只为一己私利的亲西方言论经常为了迎合新的专制统治而牺牲民主价值观。	The unfortunate paradox in Georgia – and elsewhere in the post-Soviet world – is that self-serving pro-Western rhetoric has often led democratic values to be sacrificed in favor of a new dictatorship.
具体而言，联邦政府通过联邦存款保险公司（Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation）这个机构进行干预。	Specifically, the federal government steps in through the agency of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has a credit line with the US Treasury.
虽然两者差别很大，但苏联和中国的例子都表明伊朗政权或许会在某天崩溃或发生根本变化 — — 很可能是在任何人都没有预料到时候。	As the very different examples of the Soviet Union and China show, the Iranian regime might someday collapse or change fundamentally – probably when hardly anyone expects it.
巴勒斯坦解放事业甚至谈不上阿拉伯国家压倒一切的当务之急，因此内塔尼亚胡的深度防御策略比阿巴斯博取国际承认的建国策略取得成功的机会更大。	The Palestinian cause is not the overriding preoccupation of even the Arab states, so Netanyahu’s strategy of defense in depth stands a better chance of success than Abbas’s pursuit of statehood through international recognition.
所以，一般性贷款和项目贷款的需求比以往任何时候都高：2009年头9个月，我们已经投资超过60亿欧元，这个数目是去年同期投资的两倍之多。	Demand for our loans and project finance is higher than ever: in the first nine months of 2009, we have invested more than €6 billion, twice as much as we did in the same period a year ago.
海军的研究预算削减了20%左右，而国防先进研究项目局（Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency，DARPA，负责让美国军队保持在技术曲线前沿的组织）的研发支出也削减了18 % 。	The Navy’s research budget has been cut by some 20%, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) – the organization tasked with keeping the US military ahead of the technological curve – has had to slash R&D spending by 18%.
但如今两国的角色正在发生逆转：在哥伦比亚政府与游击队的五十年战争宣告结束之时，委内瑞拉却在经济，社会和政治上陷入了崩溃。	Today, those roles are being reversed: just as Colombia’s 50-year war against the FARC is ending, Venezuela is collapsing economically, socially, and politically.
即使能够阻止这一2012年噩梦情景，12月9日的峰会也种下了未来冲突的种子，即“两速”欧洲的出现和错误的欧元区财政计划指导思想。	Even barring such a nightmare scenario in 2012, the summit sowed the seeds of future conflicts – over the emergence of a “two-speed” Europe and the false economic doctrine guiding the eurozone’s proposed fiscal pact.
北京 — — 中国的“好邻居”政策正在受到前所未有的压力；事实上，中国周边形势正处在冷战结束以来的最低潮。	BEIJING – China’s “good neighbor” policy is under unprecedented pressure; indeed, it is at its nadir since the Cold War’s end.
不幸的是对俄罗斯的邻国来讲，决定俄国天然气或输送价格的从来就不是市场，而是俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司(Gazprom)及其主席，兼任第一副总理的梅德韦捷夫(Dmitry Medvedev ) 。	Unfortunately for Russia’s neighbors, it is not the market that determines what price is paid for Russia’s gas or transport; it is Gazprom and its chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, who is also the Russian government’s First Deputy Prime Minister.
乌克兰总统波罗申科在最近的慕尼黑安全会议（Munich Security Conference）所要求的非致命装备可以提供些许指引。	The requests for non-lethal equipment made by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the recent Munich Security Conference could provide some guidance.
意大利和西班牙实施了可靠的财政增长型改革，此外欧洲央行在德国的支持下承诺会在有需要的情况下出手稳定银行部门和主权债务市场。	Italy and Spain offered credible fiscal and growth-oriented reforms, and the European Central Bank, with Germany’s backing, promised intervention as needed to stabilize the banking sector and sovereign-debt markets.
比如，特兰托实验将试点我提出的“数据新政 ” （ New Deal on Data ） ， 用户将通过信任网络软件 — — 如我们的开放PDS（个人数据存储）系统 — — 得到对自身个人数据的更大的控制权。	The Trento lab, for example, will pilot my proposed “New Deal on Data,” which gives users greater control over their personal data through trust-network software such as our open PDS (Personal Data Store) system.
1941那边，罗斯福撒谎德国攻击驱逐舰格里尔号（Greer ） ， 降低了约翰逊大力粉饰北越攻击美国海军舰艇的阻力，该事件导致1964年北部湾决议。	When Roosevelt lied about the German attack on the destroyer Greer in 1941, he set a low bar for Johnson’s highly embellished description of a North Vietnamese attack on US naval vessels, which led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964.
两个星期前，奥巴马面临着是去参加东盟的会议还是出席柏林墙倒塌20周年纪念的选择，但他最终选择去了亚洲。	Two weeks ago, when Obama had to choose between a meeting of ASEAN or the celebrations in Berlin marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall, he chose to go to Asia.
"五年后，2000年度NPT审查会议终于采纳了一份《最终文件 》 ， 文件的具体措施包括实施""十三个操作步骤 "" ， 以系统、逐步地达到核裁军的目的。"	"Five years later, the 2000 Review Conference finally adopted a Final Document , which contained concrete measures, including ""13 practical steps"" for systematic and progressive efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament."
不惜任何手段阻止巴沙尔使用其杀人机器 — — 包括定点袭击其空军和指挥中心 — — 是唯一能够阻止叙利亚流血的方法。	Preventing Assad from using his killing machine by any means, including targeted strikes on his air force and command-and-control centers, is the only way to end the bloodshed in Syria.
美国加州大学戴维斯分校的心理学教授司徒永振（Stanley Sue）研究了亚裔美国妇女中尤其多发的自杀行为（其他族裔中男性自杀数目高于女性 ） 。	Stanley Sue, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, has studied suicide, which is particularly common among Asian-American women (in other ethnic groups, more males commit suicide than females).
而他想要赢得更加谨慎的欧洲同僚也绝非易事，比如，德国总理默克尔的施展空间就因为她的政党在上周末的联邦选举中表现拙劣而大受限制。	And he will have a hard time winning over his more cautious European counterparts, not least German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose room for maneuver was crimped by her party’s poor showing in last weekend’s federal election.
而乌克兰在摆脱了强盗统治后，有望在西方领导的复苏计划的帮助下稳定下来 — — 如果它能够避免内战的话。	And Ukraine, having gotten rid of a kleptocratic thug, may stabilize under a Western-led economic revival program – that is, if the country can avoid civil war.
但他们这样做完全出自实用主义的考虑，因为在今天的波兰，把某人叫做“自由主义者”比直接骂他“狗娘养的”更具有侮辱意味。	But their purpose is purely instrumental, for to call somebody a “liberal” nowadays in Poland is more pejorative than calling him a “son of a bitch.”
反紧缩反对票在政府无法有效实施改革的国家（如希腊）最多，而葡萄牙和西班牙正好相反，它们的经济正在强劲的出口的带动下复苏。	The anti-austerity protest vote is strongest where governments have been unable to implement reforms effectively (for example, in Greece), in contrast to Portugal and Spain, whose economies are recovering on the back of strong exports.
尽管如此，如果欧元区内部流动性能够与蒙代尔的理想状况略有相似，那么如今我们就不会看到西班牙失业率高达25%而德国失业率低至不到7%的情况。	Still, if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell’s ideal, today we would not be seeing 25% unemployment in Spain while Germany’s unemployment rate is below 7%.
至少在最低限度上，无论其智力程度高低，这些大猩猩应当如同我们赋予人类所有成员的那样，拥有生存，自主和免遭折磨的权利。	At a minimum, they should have the rights to life, liberty, and protection from torture that we grant to all members of our own species, regardless of their intellectual abilities.
实际上，我们还应该反复地这么做，直到有迹象表明额外的刺激开始威胁到价格或是债务处理的稳定性。 或是直到失业率显著下降。	Indeed, we should do it repeatedly, until there are signs that additional stimulus may start to threaten price or debt-management stability, or until unemployment falls far enough to make Barro’s multipliers overestimates.
类似地，大和证券（Akira Matsumoto）CEO铃木茂晴（Shigeharu Suzuki）任命女性为公私高管以改善销售能力，结果令人欣喜。	Likewise, Daiwa Securities CEO Shigeharu Suzuki has appointed women as executive officers to improve sales capabilities, with promising results.
所有亚洲人都应该认识到，不管共产主义中国什么时候认为它面临威胁，它都会付诸武力解决 — — 1950年的朝鲜、1962年的印度、1969年的苏联、1979年的越南都是如此。	As everyone in Asia should recognize, whenever communist China has deemed that it faced such a threat, it has resorted to war – in Korea in 1950, India in 1962, the Soviet Union in 1969, and Vietnam in 1979.
这一指标 — — 每个劳动适龄人口的产出增长率 — — 并未被经济学家所广泛使用，而是以人均 GDP 为重点。	That indicator – growth rate per working-age person – is not widely used by economists, who instead focus on GDP per capita.
此外，他的选票上有一个女人可能会吸引因参议员希拉里·克林顿在民主党候选人提名竞选中败给参议员巴拉克·奥巴马而感到失望的一部分选民。	Moreover, a woman on his ticket might attract some of those disappointed by Senator Hillary Clinton’s loss to Senator Barack Obama in the Democratic race.
经济学家、政治理论家、道德和政治哲学家、社会学家、甚至普罗大众很快就注意到了这个似乎 — — 也确实是 — — 灾难性的结果。	Economists, political theorists, moral and political philosophers, sociologists, and even the general public rapidly took notice of what seemed like – and indeed was – a devastating result.
我们认为坐在学校里只是第一步；我们希望激励儿童成为领导者和企业家，并将学校学到的技能应用于改善他们的社区和国家。	In our view, finding a seat in school is only the first step; we want to inspire children to become leaders and entrepreneurs, and to apply skills learned in school to improving their communities and countries.
纽约—一年前，我在巴西启动联合国可持续发展方案网络（ustainable Development Solutions Network，SDSN）巴西章。 这是联合国秘书长潘基文发起的项目。	NEW YORK – One year ago, I was in Brazil to launch the Brazilian chapter of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), an initiative of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
没有人用比特币来标价；很少有零售商接受它；价值储备功能也很糟糕，因为它的价格可以在一天内波动20~30 ％ 。	Few retailers accept it. And it is a poor store of value, because its price can fluctuate by 20-30% in a single day.
申请费率水平是要保持透明的，但是单个成员获取资金的实际成本将继续严格保密（像任何保险合同做的那样 ） 。	The scale of premium rates would need to be transparent but the actual cost of access for individual members would remain strictly confidential (as in any insurance contract).
同时，苏丹政府也必须充分认识到，只有坚持以前的承诺，并帮助联合国/非洲联盟准备、部署并维护这一行动才能得到国际社会的继续支持。	At the same time, the Sudanese government must be fully aware that only by adhering to past commitments and by cooperating in helping to prepare, deploy, and maintain the mission will the international community be encouraged to continue its support.
如果黄背心们认为他们启动的机器已经超出了自身的控制，而且他们无法再阻止第四幕的发生，那么他们必须随时准备配合警察开展对混在他们当中崇尚暴力的“棕背心”的清洗活动。	If the Yellow Vests decide the machine they have unleashed has overtaken them, and they can no longer stop Act IV, they must be prepared during the protests to help the police flush out the violent “brown vests” who will be circulating among them.
如果故事最终被证明是个骗局，市场可能会恢复早先的合理估值，而先行者最终将打成平手，甚至可能借市场下跌时买入的对冲头寸获利。	If the story is a hoax, the market will probably return to its earlier, fairly valued level, and the first mover will break even on its sales, and possibly profit from any position purchased as a hedge when the market was down.
只在周末使用大麻或频率更低者通常并不会更易患上精神病，每日和周末使用大麻的AKT1的C/T和T/T变体携带者也是如此。	Using cannabis on weekends or less often posed no increased risk, which was also the case for daily and weekend use among carriers of the C/T and T/T variants of AKT1.
特别是沙特阿拉伯，它需要面临艰难的国内改革，包括经济多样化措施，同时它自身也陷入了对叙利亚和也门的军事干涉。	Saudi Arabia, in particular, is facing difficult domestic reforms, including efforts to diversify its economy, while mired in its own military interventions in Syria and Yemen.
但是鉴于任何成功的民主转型必须包括文官控制大部分军队和安全机构，最高军事委员会的最低要求可能会使这个过程毫无意义。	But, given that any successful democratic transition must include meaningful civilian control over the armed forces and the security apparatus, the SCAF’s minimum demands could render the process meaningless.
这一解释看上去比第一个解释还要矛盾，但逻辑很清楚：政府常常试图摆脱通过供给端改革改善经济效率的艰巨任务，而依靠供给端措施。	This explanation may seem even more paradoxical than the first, but the logic is straightforward: Governments often try to escape the hard task of improving economic efficiency through supply-side reforms and rely on demand-side fixes instead.
《华盛顿邮报》最近发表了一篇由四部分组成的系列文章，揭示了针对华尔街、穆斯林、贸易协议、华盛顿、警察枪击、奥巴马总统、共和党、移民和其他目标的群众愤怒。	The Washington Post recently published a four-part series of articles revealing popular fury aimed at Wall Street, Muslims, trade deals, Washington, police shootings, President Barack Obama, Republicans, immigrants, and other targets.
比如我们可以轻易写出公式来描述一个悬挂在弹簧上的小球如何运动，但如果我们拉伸弹簧且晃动小球到一定程度，这些公式就失效了。	For instance, we can easily write down the equations for a ball on a swinging spring, but if we stretch the spring enough and swing the ball hard enough, we can’t solve those equations.
一个时间上的巧合是德国总理默克尔和中国国家主席习近平都即将面临国内政坛大事，人们广泛预计，他们将借此巩固未来几年的领导地位。	In a case of curious timing, both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping are approaching domestic political events that are widely expected to solidify their leadership positions in the coming years.
芝加哥—自20世纪70年代以来，博弈论在学术上的流行使得宏观经济学家开始强调“承诺”的重要性。 承诺本是意在通过限制决策者自由裁量权改善长期经济结果的策略。	CHICAGO – Since the late 1970’s, the academic diffusion of game theory has led macroeconomists to emphasize the importance of “commitment,” a strategy that aims to enhance long-term economic outcomes by restricting policymakers’ discretion.
中国从这些措施中所得到的好处，很有可能大大低于贸易战升级所造成的损失 — — 特别是在欧盟已经安全，而中国需要独自面对美国的时候。	Whatever benefit China derives from such measures may well be outweighed by an escalating trade war– especially now that the EU is safe and China will have to face the US alone.
这些企业通过同时为消费者和小企业打造平台 — — 从根本上说，它们也是在提供一个公共基础设施 — — 直接对国企的传统业务模式构成挑战。	By creating platforms for consumers and small-scale producers – what is essentially public infrastructure – these firms have directly challenged the SOE business model.
所有人都必须携起手来 — — 为了共同的事业寻找共同的解决方案 — — 应对气候变化、贫困及核裁军等各项挑战。	All must work together – in common cause for common solutions – to address challenges like climate change, poverty, and nuclear disarmament.
而除了有效的协作之外还需要改进疾病监控体系以及更进一步的创新，特别是在诊断，药物和疫苗，杀虫剂和病毒寄主控制方面。	Beyond effective collaboration, success will demand improved surveillance and greater innovation, particularly in diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, insecticides, and vector control.
廉价信贷和错误的激励机制（例如提拔对GDP增长贡献最大的官员等）引发大规模的重复投资，进而导致制造业和基础设施行业的产能过剩。	Cheap credit and perverse incentives – such as promotions for officials who contribute most to GDP growth – have led to massive but redundant investment, which, in turn, has contributed to excess capacity in manufacturing and infrastructure.
而当前许多药物的问题之一是，即使伴随着治疗，主导型抑郁症复发的几率仍非常高 - - 大约70-80 % 。	Still, one of the problems with many of the current medications is that, even with treatment, the recurrence of major depression is very high - around 70-80%.
如果最高法院当前没有通过改革计划，美国医疗保健支出总额将从现在GDP的16％上升到2025年GDP的25 ％ 。	Without reform of the type now before the Supreme Court, total US health expenditures will rise from 16% of GDP today to 25% by 2025.
包括沙特阿拉伯、利比亚、叙利亚、突尼斯、萨达姆统治的伊拉克和阿拉伯联合酋长国在内的完全独裁政府没有真正意义上的选举，选拔和任命政府要职。	In the complete autocracies - Saudi Arabia, Libya, Syria, Tunisia, Iraq under Saddam, and the United Arab Emirates - there have been no meaningful elections to fill the most important offices.
但是对于民主的希望，无论是世俗的还是伊斯兰式的，对于相关的国家人民而言都被埋葬在了巴格达、贝鲁特和坎大哈的瓦砾和屠杀之中。	But hopes for democracy, be it secular or Islamist, for the people concerned have been buried in the rubble and carnage of Baghdad, Beirut, and Kandahar.
发自雅典 — — 自2008年以来，银行救助计划已然将本应由私人企业承担的巨额损失转嫁到了欧洲和美国的纳税人身上。	ATHENS – Since 2008, bank bailouts have entailed a significant transfer of private losses to taxpayers in Europe and the United States.
右翼党派大多持有自由市场思维，而埃及的穆斯林兄弟会及其在利比亚和突尼斯的类似党派对国家持有深深的怀疑，它们认为国家臃肿、笨拙且极其腐败。	The parties on the right largely embrace free-market thinking, while Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood and its kindred parties in Libya and Tunisia are deeply sceptical of the state, which they view as bloated, inept, and ultimately corrupt.
在许多国家，土地注册和财产权利制度需要正式化，以使个人和公司能够获得可用于抵押以换取贷款投资于生意的权益。	And in many countries, the system of land registration and property rights needs to be formalized, so that individuals and companies gain equity against which they can borrow to invest in their businesses.
实际上，大多数经济学派认为，政府的主要职责之一就是延缓周期，而“现实”商业周期理论认为减少动荡就是减少福利！	In fact, whereas most schools of economic thought maintain that one of government’s key responsibilities is to smooth the cycle, “real” business-cycle theory argues that reducing volatility reduces welfare!
因此，债券市场似乎即将迎来重大调整，许多人认为可能发生市场崩盘，拉低其他长期资产如房地产和股票的价格。	So, with the bond market appearing ripe for a dramatic correction, many are wondering whether a crash could drag down markets for other long-term assets, such as housing and equities.
经济史学家弗格森（Niall Ferguson）和舒拉里克（Moritz Schularick）创造了“中美国 ” （ Chimerica）一词来形容中国的出口导向型GDP增长和美国的过度消费之间的共生关系。	To describe the symbiotic relationship between China’s export-led GDP growth and America’s excessive consumption, the economic historians Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick coined the term “Chimerica.”
如果你玩只有一两颗子弹的俄罗斯轮盘赌，你活下去的机会肯定比死掉大，但赌注是极其高昂的 — — 或者说，让你赌上生命的东西价值低得离谱 — — 因此这绝不是明智的赌博。	If you play Russian roulette with one or two bullets in the barrel, you are more likely to survive than not, but the stakes would need to be astonishingly high – or the value you place on your life inordinately low – for this to seem a wise gamble.
30年前，哈佛大学教授傅高义（Ezra Vogel）出版了《日本后来居上：美国应当吸取的教训》一书，这本书纪念日本在制造业的推动下崛起，并最终发展为世界第二大经济体的过程。	Thirty years ago, Harvard professor Ezra Vogel published Japan as Number 1: Lessons for America, a book that celebrated Japan’s manufacturing-fueled rise to become the world’s second-largest economy.
扩大安理会的风险性成为焦点话题，让人们反而忽略了名人小组改革报告中的其余内容和101项改革建议，这些建议大多并不需要修改宪章。	But focusing on enlargement of the Security Council risks diverting attention from the rest of the Panel’s analyses and 101 recommendations for reform, many of which do not require amending the Charter.
因从雷曼手中购买债券而倒闭的Reserve Primary Fund是货币市场共同基金而不是商业银行。	The Reserve Primary Fund – brought down by its purchases of IOU’s from Lehman – was a money-market mutual fund, not a commercial bank.
然而，在这令人赞叹的经济增长成绩背后，随之而来的是诸多经济、社会、环境成本和挑战，正如前总理温家宝准确的描述 — — “不稳定、不平衡、不协调、不可持续 ” 。	But former Premier Wen Jiabao rightly described this impressive growth performance as “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable,” highlighting the many economic, social, and environmental costs and challenges that have accompanied it.
退役的海军四星上将凯利在2017年7月末从国土安全部部长调任白宫参谋长办公室，把西区管理的井井有条。	Kelly, the retired four-star Marine general who in late July 2017 switched from Secretary of Homeland Security to White House chief of staff, has established some order in the West Wing.
如果中国能在年景好的时候更大幅度地提升汇率灵活性的话，当前的情况可能会更加游刃有余，而我们有些人已经为此呼吁了超过十年。	Life would be a lot easier today if China had moved to a much greater degree of exchange-rate flexibility back when the going was good, as some of us had advised for more than a decade.
范龙佩的眼光显然会比一个任期六个月的国家总统更为长远，而阿什顿女士则能够把欧盟对外政策的政治与资源整合起来。	Van Rompuy will be able to offer a longer view than that of a six-month national presidency. Lady Ashton should be able to tie together the political and resource arms of Europe’s external policies.
其次，德国关于引入ESM的法律规定，德国代表在ESM委员会上的投票只有在要求德国央行作出决定后才能进行。	Second, Germany’s law on the introduction of the ESM obliges Germany’s representative on the ESM Council to vote only after having asked the Bundestag for a decision.
如果私有化让太多的工人失去饭碗又不给予补偿，那么大多数公民就会认为私有化不合理，这有可能影响到他们对生产资料私有制的支持。	If privatization displaces too many workers without compensation, a majority of citizens could come to see it as illegitimate, potentially undermining their support for private ownership of productive property.
即将出台的国防评估将会以过去五年所发生的事件，特别是以伊拉克、阿富汗和反恐战争的其它方面为基础，要求进行改革。	The upcoming defense review will mandate changes based on events of the past five years, focusing especially on Iraq, Afghanistan, and other aspects of the war on terror.
乘着1970年代石油业蓬勃发展的东风，尼日利亚的军事领导人将英国石油公司的资产国有化，进而成为泛非洲合作中的领军人物，并为多项非洲解放运动提供了资金支持。	While riding the crest of the last oil boom in the late 1970’s, Nigeria’s military leaders nationalized the assets of British Petroleum and became champions of pan-African co-operation, financing several African liberation movements.
1997年亚洲危机爆发，1998年俄罗斯破产，德国地区银行损失了数十亿美元，最后由德国纳税人收拾烂摊子。	When the Asian crisis peaked in 1997 and Russia declared bankruptcy the following year, Germany’s Landesbanken lost billions, and German taxpayers ultimately picked up the tab.
据最新估算，美国政府的无力支付负债高达GDP的260 % — —这还不包括常规联邦债务和无力支付的州和地方政府负债。	According to recent estimates, the US government’s unfunded liabilities are a staggering 260% of GDP – and that does not include conventional federal debt and unfunded state and local government liabilities.
尽管如此，美国要求在TPP中写入投资者保护条款，即使其许多“合作伙伴”的物权保护和司法制度与美国一样优秀。	Nonetheless, the US is demanding such provisions in the TPP, even though many of its “partners” have property protections and judicial systems that are as good as its own.
一名大学年纪的利比亚女性的父亲最近仅仅因为自己不能陪女儿出国，就剥夺了她接受美国国务院奖学金参加在华盛顿举办的培训班的机会。	A college-age Libyan woman’s father recently denied her the opportunity to accept a scholarship from the US State Department to attend a training workshop in Washington, DC, because he could not accompany her overseas.
像班农这样的激进民族主义者竟然试图团结在一个全球运动之下，仿佛是跟自己所反对的那些国际主义敌人一个德行，这似乎有点讽刺。	It might seem ironic that radical nationalists, like Bannon, should be seeking to unite in a global movement, as though they were mimicking their internationalist enemies.
研究用了一套11级评价系统让孩子们为其“生活满意度”打分，令人瞩目的是，95%的孩子的评分在第六级及以上。	The children were asked to rate their “life satisfaction” on an 11-step ladder. In the Netherlands, a remarkable 95% of children set their rating at six or higher.
2005年，美国政府因为未经证实的指控 — — 他在担任古吉拉特邦首席部长期间与2002年印度教-穆斯林冲突有染 — — 而吊销了他的签证。	In 2005, the US government revoked his visa over unproven allegations that he connived in Hindu-Muslim riots in 2002, when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat.
对他们和对像法国经济学家托马斯·皮凯蒂这样的当代思想家来说，经济世界包括两种基本物质：资本和劳动力。	For them, and for current thinkers like the French economist Thomas Piketty, the economic world consists of two fundamental substances: capital and labor.
接着传来了致命的呐喊，开始时可能只有一两个人，但很快其他人就开始加入喊话 ： “ 打倒齐奥塞斯库 ！ ”	Then came the fateful call, shouted by perhaps one or two people but soon picked up by others: “Down with Ceausescu!”
欧元区增长较几个月前接近衰退的水平略有提高，但IMF的2015年和2016年预测都没有超过1 % 。	Eurozone growth is up slightly from its near-recession levels of a few months ago, but projections by the International Monetary Fund for 2015 and 2016 barely exceed 1%.
同时，民主国家的政客应该严肃地思考国际制度的改革，因为我们迫切地需要一种能真正覆盖全球的制度。 比如说，我们可以从联合国开始。	At the same time, politicians in democratic countries need to think seriously about reforms of international institutions, because we desperately need institutions capable of real global governance.
但即便是他们都采取了一些改革措施¾虽然力度尚嫌不够，而且改革措施刚刚实行还看不出有任何变化，但归根结底，他们已经开始行动了。	But even they have carried out some reforms – not enough and too recently to make a difference yet; nonetheless, they have started to move.
条约提出了公平竞争，而非自由竞争。 但如果各成员国不能就如何贯���达成共识，那这些说辞又有什么意义呢？	Fair rather than free competition in trade is proposed, but what does this mean if member states are not able to reach consensus on how to make it happen?
但非洲开发银行决心为非洲民众提供能够带来红利的机会，无论涉及到公共保健、卫生改善、经济发展还是环境保护。	But the AfDB is determined to provide opportunities that pay dividends for African communities – in public health, improved sanitation, economic development, and environmental protection.
随着印度竞选活动升温，人们只能希望那些突发奇想 — — 以及常常随之而来的煽动性言论 — — 不会点燃一次冲突。	As India’s election campaigns heat up, one can only hope that those whims – and the incendiary rhetoric that often accompanies them – do not ignite a conflagration.
欧元区则正逐渐变为一个内部发展不同步的经济集团，而这一趋势的潜在政治后果也引发了投资者们越来越多的关注。	But the eurozone is increasingly turning into a two-speed economic bloc, and the potential political ramifications of this trend are amplifying investors’ concerns.
到目前为止一切照旧：此次大选的主要挑战者和以往一样，仍然是民主革新党和独立民主联盟，这两党的主要区别在于对待同为其母党的军政府的态度不同（民主革新党更注重自我批评 ） 。	So far, nothing new: the RN and the UDI – which differ mainly in their attitude towards the military government from which they emerged (the RN being the more self-critical) – have been the main challengers in all the previous elections.
我们的年轻人从大量流入的，以安非他明类兴奋剂(ATS)为主的麻醉品中染上毒瘾的风险正处于历史最高点。 而这些毒品的源头正是缅甸，那里的将军们和毒枭沆瀣一气。	Our youth are at an all-time high risk of drug addiction from the massive flow of narcotics, particularly amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), from Burma, while the generals there maintain congenial ties with notorious drug lords.
尽管像英国央行行长兼金融稳定委员会主席马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）这样的高级别中央银行家认为银行体系目前已经拥有足够的资本，但许多人不同意他的看法。	Even though senior central bankers like Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the Financial Stability Board, think there is now enough capital in the banking system, many do not share his view.
（我们将会看到，一旦美国的烟雾弹消失，以及美国的货币和债务的巨大扩张变得明显时，投资者会怎样评价美元。 ）	(We will see how investors judge the dollar once the smoke clears and the huge expansion of US money and debt becomes evident.)
国际参与者可以和阿拉伯国家一起合作推销这些机会，让阿拉伯经济从专注基础设施的长期国际融资活动中获得好处。	International actors, jointly with Arab governments, can then help to market these opportunities, allowing Arab economies to benefit from infrastructure-focused long-term international financing.
问题在于智利的税后基尼系数在50左右（巴西、哥伦比亚和秘鲁也是如此 ） ， 而发达国家的基尼系数大多在30以下甚至20大几。	The problem is that Chile’s after-tax Gini coefficient is approximately 50 (Brazil, Colombia, and Peru have similar figures), while those of the advanced countries are mostly in the low 30’s or even the high 20’s.
另一个可选的对象是国际货币与金融委员会（IMFC ） ， 它是由一些国家的财长和央行行长组成的 ，每年聚会两次，共同讨论有关IMF的一些问题。	There is, however, a representative alternative – the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), a group of finance ministers and central bank governors that meets twice a year to advise the International Monetary Fund.
不管今天公司利润报告和股市指数表现多好，如果这些基本社会问题得不到正确的解决，一国就无法实现包容性可持续成功 — — 不管在经济上还是在人道角度上。	Regardless of what today's corporate profit reports and stock indices may show, a country cannot achieve inclusive, sustainable success – in economic or human terms – if these fundamental social issues are not adequately addressed.
毕竟。 彻底消灭一个从混乱中崛起的运动的唯一办法是构建强大称职的国家，特朗普既没有计划，也没有耐心这样做。	After all, the only way fully to defeat a movement that thrives amid chaos is to build strong and competent states, a task for which Trump lacks both the inclination and the patience.
坎布里奇 — — 当赌注很高时，政治对手利用从经济学家和其他研究人员那里得来的一切证据并没有什么希奇。	CAMBRIDGE – When the stakes are high, it is no surprise that battling political opponents use whatever support they can garner from economists and other researchers.
为此，去年12月参议员杰克·里德（Jack Reed）提出的议案是一个积极的步骤 — — 这将要求监管机构更仔细地研究重组规则会对金融系统的稳定性造成何等损害。	To this end, a bill introduced by Senator Jack Reed last December – which would require regulators to examine more carefully how restructuring rules could destabilize the financial system – is a positive step.
美国成年人中每100人就有一人深陷囹圄 — — 这一人均比例为世界之最，比西欧或其他民主国家高5—10倍。	One out of every 100 American adults is incarcerated – the highest per capita rate in the world, 5-10 times higher than in Western Europe or other democracies.
压制来自霍多尔科夫斯基的潜在威胁就意味着通过把梅纳特普银行集团从尤克斯集团未来的现金流转中分离出来，以使他丧失成就野心的能力。	Neutralizing the perceived threat from Khodorkovsky meant depriving him of the means to achieve his ambitions by separating his Menatep Group from Yukos’s future cash flows.
并不是所有的民主国家都像法国那样有如此严格的正式的世俗主义，但是它们都是世俗论的。 法律是由拥有主权的人民而不是由某个超人或其代理来制定的。	Not all democracies were as strict as France in their formal secularism but all were secular: the law is made by the sovereign people and not by some superhuman being or agency.
尽管美国和欧洲人口只占世界的八分之一，但它们长期占据着经济主宰地位 — — GDP约占世界的一半 — — 并拥有不成比例的国际影响力。	Despite accounting for only one-eighth of the world’s population, the United States and Europe have long enjoyed economic dominance – accounting for half of global GDP – and disproportionate international influence.
如果班农真的按照自己的民族主义设想来设法改造共和党，而且如果共和党人未来继续掌握或重新夺回权力，美国对欧洲的安全承诺将变得不再可靠。	If Bannon does manage to transform the Republican Party in accordance with his nationalist vision, and if the Republicans retain or regain power in the future, US security commitments to Europe will no longer be reliable.
北京—朝鲜放出战争狂言近一个月后，中国好像是受够了，不再对朝鲜的边缘行为保持沉默，突然表示了对这一盟国鲁莽威胁的失望。	BEIJING – After nearly a month of belligerent bluster from North Korea, China appears to have had enough, ending its silence about North Korea’s brinkmanship and suddenly roaring its disapproval of its ally’s reckless threats.
当时的阿根廷在放弃连系汇率制度之前的2001年确实发行了一种代用货币，以此满足财政需求和保持兑美元的稳定汇率。	While Argentina did issue quasi-money in 2001 before abandoning the currency board, this money was conceived to meet fiscal needs and remained stable vis-à-vis the dollar.
我们已经展示了PARP抑制剂如何能够有效杀死有BRCA2缺陷的乳腺癌细胞，并且由它们所引发的肿瘤能在使用PARP抑制剂后缩小并彻底消失。	We have shown that PARP inhibitors are effective at killing BRCA2-defective breast cancer cells, and that the tumors they cause can fully regress and disappear following treatment with a PARP inhibitor.
值得注意的是，我还收获了来自自然科学专业人士的评论，表示民众对专家信任度越来越低的现象在他们的学科领域也普遍存在着。	Remarkably, I also received comments from professionals in the natural sciences who said that citizens’ growing distrust of experts was pervasive in their disciplines, too.
事实上，当我们考虑由于人类行为引起的气候变化的可能后果时，如果我们对此作出错误的决定，那么，南非由于姆贝基错误政策所造成的死亡人数和这个错误决定所造成的死亡人数相比，会相形见绌。	Indeed, when we contemplate the possible consequences of climate change caused by human activities, the number of human lives that could be lost by the wrong decision dwarfs the number lost in South Africa.
她就像是滑稽戏里的角色，在一段令人尴尬的修辞脱衣舞之后，她拿掉了处理员给她戴上的体面（respectability）的面具，露出了死硬法西斯政党领导者的面目。	Like a character in a farce, she drops the mask of respectability that her handlers had made her wear and, after an embarrassing rhetorical striptease, reveals the face of the leader of a die-hard fascist party.
大部分人德国、荷兰和芬兰人认为希腊、西班牙和塞浦路斯等国家的公共支出过度和监管不力是欧元区以及欧盟发生动荡的罪魁。	Most people in Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland blame excessive public spending and inadequate regulation in countries like Greece, Spain, and Cyprus for destabilizing the eurozone and, in turn, the EU.
发自日内瓦 — — 在电影《危险心灵》中，女演员米歇尔·普法伊费尔（Michelle Pfeiffer）饰演一位在内陆小城担任高中老师的前美国海军陆战队员。	GENEVA – In the movie Dangerous Minds, the actress Michelle Pfeiffer plays a former US Marine who becomes a teacher in an inner-city high school.
那些依靠向美国以及欧洲出口产品并拥有大量经常账户盈余的国家（中国，亚洲的大部分国家以及大部分其他新兴市场国家）会因为G7的衰退受到不利影响。	Those economies that are dependent on exports to the US and Europe and that have large current-account surpluses (China, most of Asia, and most other emerging markets) will suffer from the G7 recession.
莱因哈特和罗格夫给出了一些大萧条后复苏增长缓慢的原因：一是政策反应速度太慢，而是金本位（金本位意味着各国无法通过出口走出萧条 ） 。	Reinhart and Rogoff offer a couple of reasons for the difference in recovery rates: the slow policy response to the Great Depression and the gold standard, which meant that individual countries could not export their way out of depression.
美国政府在军事和卫生领域的巨额投入引发了关键性的科研，这些科研工作又进一步吸引了民间资金—包括来自欧洲的公司，特别是制药公司的资金。	Massive military and health investments by the US government have generated a critical mass of research, which in turn attracts private funding – including from European companies, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry.
一个接一个的IMF项目要求巴基斯坦征缴更多预扣税（而且从未退还过 ） ， 附加费以及针对石油和电力等基本商品的税款，即便这些措施会损害就业和投资增长。	Successive IMF programs have required that Pakistan adopt more withholding taxes (never to be refunded), surcharges, and levies on essential goods such as oil and electricity, even though these measures hurt employment and investment growth.
在全世界都在等待科学确定性（有可能永远不会到来）的时候，能够指引我们走入未知的方案已经存在 ： “ 预防原则 ” 。	And, as the world waits for scientific certainty (which may never arrive), there is an existing solution that can guide us into the unknown: the “precautionary principle.”
而在美国，一切测量不平等的方法自世纪之交以来都指向了同一方向，反映出经济增长所带来的好处了几乎全都归了位于社会顶层的那一小撮人。	In the US, however, all measures of inequality have pointed in the same direction since the turn of the century, reflecting the fact that the benefits of economic growth have gone almost exclusively to those at the top.
但是政治家们善于进行重新包装，并且，根据有些数据，这些新资金只占所需总资金的一小部分，即使这一小部分的资金也不会立即投入到系统中来。	But politicians are good at repackaging, and, by some accounts, the new money is a small fraction of that amount, and even that will not get into the system immediately.
贸易占总经济活动之比在过去十年中下降了一半，从2007年占GDP的60%以上下降到今天的略高于30 % 。	Trade as a share of its total economic activity has halved in the past decade, from more than 60% of GDP in 2007 to just over 30% today.
这一建议未必会给欧盟移民造成困难；它只是意味着，移民在四年等待期期间的任何支持要求都必须由母国出资。	The proposal does not necessarily imply hardship for EU migrants; it simply means that any support they may require over the four-year period is to be financed by their home country.
日本消费电子产品制造商不再能够执世界之牛耳的一个原因就在于它们没有充分利用管理岗位上的妇女员工，尽管她们拥有丰富的经验。	One reason that Japan’s consumer electronics manufacturers are no longer world-beaters is that they have not fully used their female employees in managerial positions, despite their varied experiences.
数字技术才是信息域的真正土著居民，就像水里生活的鱼，而我们更像是适应混合了模拟和数字成分的新栖息地的生物。	Like fish in water, digital technologies are our infosphere’s true natives, while we analog organisms try to adapt to a new habitat, one that has come to include a mix of analog and digital components.
但协议却最终破裂了，而朝鲜声称除非美国将那些涉嫌为金正日政权伪造货币或洗钱的银行账户解冻，否则它就不会回到六方会谈。	But the agreement soon collapsed, and North Korea refused to return to the talks until the United States stopped shutting down bank accounts suspected of counterfeiting and laundering money for Kim’s regime.
多年以来，有远见的台湾工业家，包括许多高科技企业的老板，敦促陈对台湾越来越被孤立的经济实行去官僚主义和去政治化。	For years, forward looking Taiwanese industrialists, including many hi-tech entrepreneurs, urged Chen to de-bureaucratize and de-politicize Taiwan’s increasingly isolated economy.
我们还指出存在自其他国家输入中国装配平台的原料所引起的供应链扭曲现象，一旦把这种统计手法纠正过来将会令美中贸易失衡数字减少35~40 ％ ， 但应者寥寥。	Nor does it matter when we point out that correcting for supply-chain distortions – caused by inputs from other countries that enter into Chinese assembly platforms – would reduce the bilateral US-China trade imbalance by 35-40%.
对相信进步应成为21世纪社会指南的任何人而言，重点任务是要在今天的环境下重新界定进步的含义并明确相应的政策议程。	For anyone who believes that progress should remain the compass guiding societies in the twenty-first century, the priority is to redefine it in today’s context and to spell out the corresponding policy agenda.
这部电影使用一些生动的图表、画面以及其他信息，有力地阐明了人类的二氧化碳排放造成全球气候变暖，或者至少是促进气候变暖，并且大力呼吁处理这一问题是当务之急。	Using some remarkable graphs, images, and other information, the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming, or, at the very least, contributing to it, and that we must urgently address the issue.
事实上，众议院共和党可能被迫签署一项既能支持经济、又能将收入回到灾难性的布什经济学实验之前水平的方案。	In effect, the House Republicans can be forced to sign onto a deal that both supports the economy and restores revenue to the level that prevailed before the disastrous experiment of Bushonomics.
如果在2008年出现了一个运作成熟的财政联盟，那么欧盟移民的缺席可能会让英国脱欧者在2016年的号召力大打折扣。	If a fully-fledged fiscal union had emerged in 2008, the absence of EU immigration would have denied the Brexiteers a powerful rallying cry in 2016.
如果国际货币基金组织不得不达到私营部门的标准，它就可能会创设一个满足其成员国潜在短期流动性需求的新工具。	If the IMF had to live up to private-sector standards, it would create a new instrument that would meet members’ potential demand for short-term liquidity.
斯堪的那维亚国家的成功除了内含的会计把戏外，高政府就业份额还可能对解决西方经济体所面临的最为基本的问题之一作出实际的贡献。	Apart from the accounting trick implicit in Scandinavia’s success, the high share of government in employment may also make a real contribution to solving one of the most fundamental problems western economies now face.
所谓“保护责任（responsibility to protect ） ” 的理念在联合国世界峰会上一致通过，但后续发生的事件却表明各国对此的理解大不相同。	The idea of a “responsibility to protect” (R2P) was adopted unanimously at the UN’s World Summit in 2005, but subsequent events showed that not all member states interpreted the resolution the same way.
其他国家的领导人遵从美国在至关重要的和平谈��上的地位是一回事，但是另一方面当无辜的民众受到残酷的虐待时世界绝不能袖手旁观。	It is one thing for other leaders to defer to the US on the crucial peace negotiations, but the world must not stand idle while innocent people are treated cruelly.
西班牙的胜利是少有的加泰罗尼亚人、卡斯蒂利亚人、巴斯克人和安达卢西亚人走到一起共同沉浸在爱国主义的狂热中的时刻。	Spain’s victory was one of the rare occasions that Catalonians, Castillians, Basques, and Andalusians erupted together in an explosion of patriotic delight.
即使在加大程度的社会转移确实减少不公的情况下(而且因此而假定提高凝聚 ) ， 如果少数族裔被认为是强大的净受益人的话，那么，它们可能破坏社区之间的关系。	Even where high levels of social transfers actually do reduce inequality (and therefore presumably increase cohesion), they may undermine inter-communal relations if ethnic minorities are perceived as being strong net beneficiaries.
事实上，一个不愿履行保护民众责任的社会，就像最近叙利亚所表现出来的那样，不大可能因为雕像、手稿和绘画而团结在一起。	Indeed, a world that is unwilling to fulfill its responsibility to protect people, as has been shown most recently in Syria, is unlikely to come together on behalf of statues, manuscripts, and paintings.
拉加德是IMF总裁的最佳人选，金砖四国（巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国）等新兴力量并没有联合推举替代人选。	Lagarde is the best candidate for the job, and emerging powers like the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) have not united behind an alternative.
对外关系委员会主席哈斯（Richard Haass）最近表示美国“或许已经进入又一个美国世纪的第二个十年 。 ”	Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, suggested recently that the US “could already be in the second decade of another American century.”
事实上，即使食品公司让你相信糖果可以称为均衡膳食的组成部分，它们也得有个底线：创造出一种非均衡膳食。	Indeed, while food companies would have you believe that sugar can be part of a balanced diet, the bottom line is that they have created an unbalanced one.
一如既往，这些人满嘴花言巧语：建立一个巴勒斯坦人拥有公民权，却没有民族权利的犹太国家，这对于一个陷入长期内战的国家来说似乎还不错。	As always, they want the best of all worlds: an emphatically Jewish state in which Palestinians would have citizenship rights, but no national rights whatsoever. That is not a bad formula for a state of permanent civil war.
世界依赖于波斯湾的石油意味着各国在改善能源效率、增加其总体能源供应的多样性的同时，对维护中东地区的稳定都利益相关。	The world’s dependence on Persian Gulf oil means that all countries have an interest in maintaining stability in that region, while improving energy efficiency and increasing the diversity of their overall energy supplies.
这些元素实现着关键功能，比如输送氧气、营养物质和免疫球蛋白（可防卫传染病 ） ， 并调节水含量、温度和pH水平。	These elements perform crucial functions, such as transporting oxygen, nutrients, and immunoglobulins (which defend against infection), and regulating water content, temperature, and pH level.
如果一位妇女能够接种流感等常见疾病的疫苗，她的身体就能产生能够识别病毒、增强病原体自然抵抗力的抗体。	When a woman is vaccinated against common illnesses like influenza, her body creates antibodies that recognize viruses and boost natural defenses against pathogens.
结果，大多数高级法官被捕，同时被捕的还有全国所有企图捍卫司法独立的律师协会主席、主要律师，以及人权活动家。	The result was the detention of most of the senior judiciary, as well as bar association presidents across the country and all leading lawyers and human rights activists seeking to defend judicial independence.
每一个低于产能的增长年份都意味着未来增长能力的下降，这是因为投资有所下降，工人技能和经验有所损失，风险承担行为有所减少。	Every year of below-capacity growth means lower growth capacity in the future, owing to lost investment, erosion of worker skills and experience, and diminished risk-taking.
尽管2008年全球金融危机对其信誉造成了损害，但G20国家迅速达成一致，避免该共识所坚决反对的保护主义政策。	While the 2008 global financial crisis eroded its credibility, the G20 countries quickly agreed to avoid the protectionist policies against which the consensus stood.
一些公司正在探索新的“社会企业”方法，该方法让它们满足发展中世界的需要，同时又能覆盖成本甚至略有盈利。	Some corporations are beginning to explore new “social business” approaches that will allow them to meet the needs of people and society in the developing world, while at the same time covering their costs, or even making a small profit.
似乎更明智的做法是聆听当代普罗米修斯，如已故的史蒂芬·霍金、微软创始人比尔·盖茨，以及2017年发声讨论武器化AI和机器人的威胁的其他115位科技领袖。	It seems wiser to heed modern-day Promethean thinkers such as the late Stephen Hawking, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and the 115 other tech leaders who in 2017 spoke out about the threat of weaponized AI and robotics.
我们在过去曾经见过这样的情况，旷日持久的紧张局面 — — 比如2012年中日钓鱼岛/尖阁列岛领土纠纷 — — 可能严重损害经济和外交关系。	As we have seen in the recent past, protracted tensions – for example, the territorial disputes between China and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in 2012 – can severely damage economic and diplomatic relations.
但是，尽管美国名义住房价格在此前70年里从未下跌，但20世纪90年代的日本和20世纪30年代的美国曾经出现过这种情况。	But, while nominal housing prices had not fallen in the US in the previous 70 years, they had fallen in Japan in the 1990s and in the US in the 1930s.
叙利亚最有可能的结果是，人道灾难将一直持续到总统巴沙尔·阿萨德政权倒台，此后，叙利亚极有可能会因种族和宗教原因分裂。	The most likely outcome in Syria is that the human catastrophe will continue until President Bashar al-Assad’s regime collapses, after which the country very likely could be divided along ethnic and religious lines.
于是，核军备竞赛开始了。 1960年，美国总统肯尼迪警告说，到20世纪60年代中期将由15、20乃至25个有核国家。	So the nuclear arms race began, and in 1960 President John F. Kennedy warned that there would be 15, 20, or 25 nuclear states by the mid-1960s.
在国际层面上，为了缓解当前在投资和市场上的“竞相降低门槛”的全球竞争压力，需要国家之间的合作和协调。	At the international level, cooperation and coordination among countries are needed to counteract the pressures of the current “race to the bottom” in the global competition for investment and markets.
尽管跨大西洋关税平均水平只有3—5 % （ 某些敏感商品会更高一些 ） ， 但取消关税仍能起到重大作用，因为双边贸易总额高达每年6500亿美元。	Although transatlantic tariffs average only 3-5% (with higher peaks for some sensitive products), tariff elimination would have a significant impact, given that bilateral trade totals $650 billion annually.
为此，政界必须避免2011年几乎将美国重新打回衰退的争吵，这也引起了人们对美国经济治理质量的重大怀疑。	To accomplish that, the political class must avoid the bickering that almost sent America back into recession in 2011, and that raised major questions about the quality of the country’s economic governance.
大约90% 的西班牙人 — — 比任何其他西方国家的比例都要高 — — 反对西班牙政府所支持的伊拉克战争。	Some 90% of Spaniards – more than any other Western population – opposed the Iraq War, which their government supported.
无可否认，在全球金融危机和采用量化宽松政策期间 — — 当时通胀率远低于2 ％ — —欧洲央行的这一价格稳定定义毫无问题。	To be sure, the ECB’s definition of price stability was not a problem during the period between the global financial crisis and the adoption of quantitative easing, when inflation was well below 2%.
但问题在于允许以借贷的方式进行公共投资会导致委员会和各个成员国之间矛盾不断，因为这种做法过多地有赖于本已模糊的界线。	The problem is that allowing public investment to be financed by borrowing would lead to continuing disputes between the Commission and individual member states, because it relies excessively on that blurred distinction.
因此，难怪多数政治家都选择回避这一挑战，而且从1992年联合国气候变化框架公约签订后所取得的实际进展就一直甚微。	Small wonder, then, that most politicians have shied away from this challenge, and that far too little practical progress has been made since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in 1992.
尽管金融家索罗斯支持的基金会并没有像俄罗斯民族主义者宣称的那样制造玫瑰革命，但是它的确培育、鼓励以及支持了民主的先决条件。	Although the foundation backed by the financier George Soros did not fabricate the Rose Revolution, as Russian nationalists claim, it certainly nurtured, encouraged, and supported democracy’s preconditions.
如果市场原教旨主义政治明确地禁止收入再分配或者，或者禁止可以补偿因为自由贸易和劳动力市场“灵活性”而蒙受损失者的地区、行业和教育补贴会如何？	What if market-fundamentalist politics specifically prohibits the income redistribution or regional, industrial, and education subsidies that could compensate those who suffer from free trade and labor-market “flexibility”?
试想，如果其他地区组织，如海湾合作委员会、南亚地区合作协会等，如果能够坚守类似的规范，能够尝到多大的甜头。	Imagine how other regional organizations, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council or the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation, could benefit from adherence to such norms.
因此，将州债务揽下并不是美国独立战争后实现金融稳定性的中心原因，相反，这只是大部分债务起源于为统统目标而战这一事实的自然结果。	Thus, assuming state debt was not central to the success of post-war financial stabilization in the new country; rather, it was a natural corollary of the fact that most of the debt had been incurred fighting for a common cause.
因此，一个合理的假设是，中国的堕胎中有多达一半 — — 每年650万起注册在案的人工流产，以及未知数量的药物流产或未注册流产 — — 可归因于一胎政策。	So it is reasonable to estimate that as many as half of China’s abortions – some 6.5 million registered surgical abortions, plus untold numbers of drug-induced or unregistered abortions, per year – are attributable to the one-child policy.
巴塞罗那宣言十周年纪念为他们提供了一个重要机会来达成对统一立场的共识，即通过停止支持地中海地区的政治现状来支持当地的民主改革。	A key opportunity presents itself with the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration to define a common position to support democratic change in the Mediterranean by ceasing to back the political status quo there.
这些人绝对不会到达产生群众运动的规模，但是，作为在错综复杂的穆斯林和西方世界的互动关系中的主角，他们视武装恐怖主义为他们的首选。	In no sense do these people amount to a mass movement. But, as protagonists in the complex web of interaction between the Muslim and the Western worlds, they view militant terrorism as their preferred option.
当他展望历史评判时，似乎意识到单凭硬权力还不足以强化自己的名誉，但却依然任由可能使他殚精竭虑的计划脱离轨道的事件和意外发生。	As he looks ahead to the verdict of history, he seems to realize that hard power alone will not consolidate his reputation, but he remains hostage to incidents and accidents that could drive even his best-laid plans off course.
那些在海湾国家当移民的孟加拉国工人带着激进的瓦哈比（Wahhabi）和Salafi所教授的思想回到祖国，愈加地煽风点火。	Bangladeshi migrant workers in the Gulf States who return home imbued with radical Wahhabi and Salafi teachings fan the fires even more.
事实上，根据经合组织的研究，他们产出了世界10%的肉产品；在一些地区，他们供应了60%的牛肉和70%的牛奶。	Indeed, according to an OECD study, they are responsible for 10% of the world’s meat production; in some regions, they supply as much as 60% of the beef and 70% of the milk consumed.
幸运的是，政府已经明确意识到教育挑战，并且正通过学校改革、追加投资和引入全新教学信息技术来积极应对。	Fortunately, the government has clearly acknowledged the education challenge and is pursuing it through school reforms, increased investments, and the introduction of new information technologies in the classroom.
这场金融经济危机原本是由过高的私人部门负债和杠杆率所引爆的，政府为防止大萧条再度上演，付出了公共部门严重地再杠杆化的代价。	A financial and economic crisis caused by too much private-sector debt and leverage led to a massive re-leveraging of the public sector in order to prevent Great Depression 2.0.
简言之，这个问题就是自由贸易和经济全球化的众多反对者 — — 以及众多坚信对所有行业应当一视同仁的右翼人士 — — 想要知道的。	That, in a nutshell, is what many opponents of free trade and economic globalization – as well as many on the right who believe that all industries should be treated equally – want to know.
不久之后，在美国的要求之下，泛美开发银行及其成员没有按原计划发放贷款，而是采取了从没采取过的措施，在发放这些资金之前暗示增加海地采取政治行动的条件。	Soon after, at the behest of the US, instead of disbursing the loans as planned, the IDB and its members took the unprecedented step of implicitly adding conditions to require political action by Haiti before the funds would be released.
即使当局像其应该做的那样给硬性要求银行的大债权人承担大量损失，北部各国的纳税人也要被迫注入大量的资金到各大银行。	Northern taxpayers will be forced to inject massive amounts of capital into banks, even if the authorities impose significant losses on banks’ large and wholesale creditors, as well they should.
在美国，采取与工作者而不是雇主绑定的可转移比例制（pro-rated）福利制度 — — 如失业和残疾保险和退休金 — — 的呼声越来越高。	In the US, there is a growing interest in a system of portable, pro-rated benefits – such as unemployment and disability insurance and pensions – tied to workers, rather than employers.
印度社会公正部部长 — — 其主要职责是促进印度的达利特人的福利 — — 对此表示遗憾，但并不是针对对纠察队的暴力行为，而是认为他们被不实传言所伤害了。	India’s social justice minister, whose principal responsibility is to promote the welfare of India’s Dalits, expressed regret not for the vigilantes’ violent actions, but for the fact that they were spurred by ill-founded rumors.
其中大部分官员最终都通过业余学习或者党校拿到了博士学位（硕士学位在这场政治军备竞赛中已经起不到任何作用了 ） 。	The overwhelming majority of these officials end up receiving doctorates (a master’s degree won’t do anymore in this political arms race) granted through part-time programs or in the Communist Party’s training schools.
IMF和其他希腊债权人认为大规模财政收缩只会给经济活动、就业和税收带来暂时的影响，而大幅下降的工资、退休金和公共职位会给增长带来魔法效应。	The IMF and Greece’s other creditors have assumed that massive fiscal contraction has only a temporary effect on economic activity, employment, and taxes, and that slashing wages, pensions, and public jobs has a magical effect on growth.
希腊当局指责欧盟没有提供资金，而欧盟指责希腊没有充分利用可用资金，而大型非政府组织在使命和资金方面各自为政。	The Greek authorities blame the EU for not providing funds, the EU blames Greece for not doing enough with available funds, and large NGOs are preoccupied with maintaining their own line of command and funding.
但如果以色列或者美国对伊朗核设施发起攻击，这将是一个灾难性的错误，或者就像以色列摩萨德情机构前首脑梅厄·达甘说的那样是“最愚蠢的想法 ” 。	But an attack by either Israel or the US on Iran’s nuclear installations would be a calamitous mistake, or, as Meir Dagan, a former chief of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, put it, “the stupidest idea” possible.
不幸的是，总统奥巴马剩下的任期不足以启动让参议院重新对CTBT投票所需要进行的费时的教育和宣传运动。	Unfortunately, President Barack Obama does not have enough time left in office to launch the time-consuming education and outreach campaign needed before bringing the CTBT to the Senate for another vote.
撒哈拉以南非洲地区在四分之一世纪的经济停滞后终于在过去10年取得了进步，但那里的营养不良率仍然是全世界最高的。	Sub-Saharan Africa has, after a quarter-century of economic stagnation, made some progress over the last decade, but it maintains the highest rate of under-nutrition worldwide.
"布什总统向以色列保证 ， "" 在包括已经存在以色列人口中心这样的环境下 ， "" 以色列不必归还1967年侵占的所有领土。"	"President Bush assured the Israelis that, given the ""new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers,"" Israel does not have to return all the territories it occupied in 1967."
在世纪之交，人类基因组的首次测序带来了“逆向疫苗学 ” （ reverse vaccinology ） 。	Around the turn of the century, the first sequencing of the human genome led to “reverse vaccinology.”
事实上，几乎所有领域的大公司都是十分脆弱的，因为创业公司在接触各地客户和用户方面装备更加精良、竞争力更强、能力更大了，已经与大企业无甚区别。	Indeed, large companies in almost every field are vulnerable, as start-ups become better equipped, more competitive, and capable, like larger firms, of reaching customers and users everywhere.
传统金融危机分析将也注意力放在众多银行孱弱的资本金上，资本金过少让它们在2007—2008年资产价格暴跌时缺乏足够的储备来吸收所发生的损失。	And conventional analyses of the financial crisis focus on the weak capital base of many banks, which left them with insufficient reserves to absorb the losses they incurred when asset prices fell sharply in 2007-2008.
此外，猪和家禽是理想的食物废料处理者，它们的排泄物也可以作为养料和能量源，将未来食物链融入生产大循环。	Moreover, pigs and poultry are ideal food-waste processors, and their effluents can serve again as nutrient and energy sources, turning future food chains into interconnected production cycles.
此外，中国正在向非洲和南亚输出外国投资，从这些负债累累的商业伙伴手中换取军事基地和其他地缘战略资产。	Moreover, China is pumping foreign investment into economies across Africa and South Asia, obtaining military bases and other geostrategic assets in return from its heavily indebted commercial partners.
事实上，吸收整个生命体 — — 比如组成第一个真核细胞（通常发现于多细胞动物体内的较复杂的细胞类型）的两个细菌 — — 可能造成重大且关键性的进化。	Indeed, the absorption of entire organisms – such as the two bacteria that formed the first eukaryotic cell (the more complex cell type found in multicellular animals) – can generate large and crucial evolutionary change.
其次，媒体的数码化革命抬高了商业新闻的重要程度。 而商业新闻则是许多国家印刷和广播媒体中仅有的几个利润来源之一。	Moreover, the digital revolution in media has elevated the role of business news, one of the few profit centers for print and broadcast journalism in many countries.
许多现代人的生物学特征 — — 至少从保留下来的化石看 — — 至少在10万多年前便已出现于非洲和以色列。	Many of modern humans’ biological traits – at least those that can be preserved as fossils – were already present in Africa and Israel more than 100,000 years ago.
去年 12 月，海湾合作委员会强力支持了萨利赫的内战计划，沙特更派出军队进驻也门边境，与胡塞人直接形成了军事对峙。	Saleh received a strong endorsement from the GCC last December for his domestic wars, and Saudi Arabia has been in direct military confrontation with the Houthis, its army having crossed Yemen’s border.
哈佛大学教授史蒂文·列维斯基（Steven Levitsky）和丹尼尔·齐布拉特（Daniel Ziblatt）在他们出色的新书《民主制度如何死亡》中运用国际经验来审视这个问题。	In their excellent new book How Democracies Die, Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt use international experience to examine the question.
就像印度农业无法维持所有以土地为生的农民的生计一样，我们经历了过度捕捞的海洋也不可能维持所有渔民的生活。	Just as India’s agriculture cannot sustain all the farmers trying to live off the land, our over-fished seas cannot possibly sustain all of our fishermen.
QE退出战略 — — 如果美联储真的有勇气实施的话 — — 充其量也只能将盈余流动性从收益率更高的发展中市场引导回国内市场。	The QE exit strategy, if the Fed ever summons the courage to pull it off, would do little more than redirect surplus liquidity from higher-yielding developing markets back to home markets.
法国总统萨科齐和其他法国政客毫无疑问对最近的欧洲峰会没能就欧洲政治整合的进一步进展取得一致感到十分恼火。	President Nicolas Sarkozy and other French politicians are no doubt unhappy that the recent European summit failed to advance the cause of further EU political integration.
事实上，大选带来了诸多有益因素 — — 除了证明恣意妄为的公司资金无法收买大选，以及证明美国人口结构变迁宣判了共和党死刑之外。	In fact, the election had several salutary effects – beyond showing that unbridled corporate spending could not buy an election, and that demographic changes in the United States may doom Republican extremism.
众所周知，我们正在转向新增长模式，新模式更加审慎、更加可持续，更少依赖化石燃料，更多依赖可再生能源资源。	We all know that we are headed toward a new growth model – one that is more sober and sustainable, that depends less on fossil fuels and more on renewable energy sources.
同理，在终结了智利军事强人奥古斯托·皮诺切特16年统治的1990年公投中，即便皮氏手中握着数千条惨遭折磨和杀害的冤魂，却依然凭着一套鼓吹法律与秩序的纲领赢得了44%的赞成票。	Likewise, in the referendum that ended his 16-year rule in Chile in 1990, General Augusto Pinochet, with thousands of tortured and vanished victims in his grisly cupboard, ran on a law-and-order platform and received 44% of the vote.
结果，当货币市场基金可能无法充分偿付投资者的可能性升高时 — — 如2008年9月雷曼兄弟倒闭后 — — 地狱之门就打开了。	As a result, when the possibility arises that a money-market fund will be unable to pay investors in full – as happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 – all hell breaks loose.
即便如此，日本在首尔峰会上的谈判伙伴中国和韩国因为上个世纪在日本侵略中所遭受的苦难大声抗议日本的做法。	Nonetheless, Japan’s interlocutors at the Seoul summit, China and South Korea, which suffered enormously from Japanese aggression in the last century, have protested loudly.
这意味着与当地的医院，诊所，宗教团体和卫生保健提供者合作，这可以作为传播生物工程专业知识的关键渠道。	That means working with local hospitals, clinics, ministries, and health-care providers, which can serve as key conduits for bioengineering expertise.
其它类似的举措包括拓展个人保险的范围从而使其能够涵盖一些造成经济不平等的风险，如人力资本市场价值的丧失或无家可归的情况。	Other likely steps include broadening the scope of private insurance policies, so that they cover some risks that generate inequality, such as the loss of the market value of human capital or of one's home.
这是一种“极端道德懒惰的表现 ” ， 她在Oko.press写道 ， “ 才会用抑郁症、精神病及与之相关的结束生命的愿望来解释如此极端的公众绝望和自我牺牲 。 ”	It is an “act of extreme moral laziness,” she wrote on Oko.press, to explain “such extreme civic despair and self-sacrifice as a result of depression, mental illness, and a related desire to end one’s own life.”
哈耶克在20世纪70年代中期通胀顶峰时期提出了私人发行竞争性货币的方案，他将原因归于央行创造了过多的信用。	Hayek introduced his proposal for privately issued competitive currencies at the height of the inflationary surge of the mid-1970s, which he attributed to excessive credit creation by central banks.
皮克提认为，低增长和继承重要性之间的联系并非偶然：继承财富每年可产生2—3%的收益，而新投资只有1 % ， 因此社会流动受到了严重限制，阶层化得到了巩固。	The link between low growth and the importance of inheritance, Piketty argues, was not coincidental: with inherited wealth yielding 2-3% a year and new investment only 1%, social mobility was extremely limited and stratification was encouraged.
NPT允许拥有出于发电等目的开发核能的权利，各国政府利用这一漏洞制造生产核武器燃料所需的大部分材料。	The NPT allows countries the right to develop nuclear energy for purposes such as electricity generation, a loophole that allows governments to build most of what is necessary to produce the fuel for a nuclear weapon.
重申这一原则的一个机会将在本月到来，即全世界2,000家相关利益方参加的利物浦第五届全球卫生系统研究研讨会。	One opportunity to reaffirm this principle will come this month, when some 2,000 stakeholders from around the world gather in Liverpool for the Fifth Global Symposium on Health Systems Research.
非洲和全球所有利益相关方必须加倍努力，确保为所有人提供洁净廉价的日常用水，并且为正在遭受着历史性旱灾的非洲国家提供援助。	All stakeholders – in Africa and internationally – must redouble our efforts to ensure clean, affordable water for all, and to support African countries suffering through a historic drought.
事实上，由于所有未来税收收入之和（贴现到现在）必须不小于所有未来支出与国民债务之和，因此保持税收水平相对较低的唯一方法只有控制支出。	Indeed, because the sum of all future tax revenues (discounted to today) must cover the sum of all future spending plus the national debt, the only way to keep taxes relatively low is to control spending.
这可能需要的直接补偿或提供更多免费或半免费的公共产品（例如教育、培训、医疗，失业福利以及可以四处迁移的养老金 ） 。	This can take the form of direct compensation or greater provision of free or semi-free public goods (for example, education, retraining, health care, unemployment benefits, and portable pensions).
另一个命题是不平等转化为嫉妒和不满：特定收入水平的人本来可能很高兴，但当他们发现别人拿得更多时高兴却变成了不满。	A third proposition is that inequality translates into envy and unhappiness: someone who would have been happy at a given income is unhappy if he discovers that others are getting more.
更为重要的是，这将不让伊朗具有把令世人瞩目的伊斯兰和阿拉伯事业与其自身的霸权主义野心连接起来的能力。	More importantly, it would deny Iran the ability to link popular Islamic and Arab causes with its own hegemonic ambitions.
而对于另外一些人而言，这是由于缺少建立巴以和平的持续努力或美国反对国际刑事法庭以及有关气候变化的京都议定书。	For still others, it was the lack of sustained effort to bring about peace between Israelis and Palestinians or US opposition to the International Criminal Court and to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.
在韩国，LG公司最近提出了一项计划，从公众那里征求创新思想，承诺如若公司将发明项目商业化，则发明人能获得此过程中高达8%的权益。	In South Korea, LG recently launched a program to solicit invention ideas from the public, promising inventors a hefty 8% stake in the proceeds of any ideas the company commercializes.
反过来，大公司将收获更快创新的好处，年轻人失业率会下降，中产阶级 — — 及其对未来生活水平的信念 — — 遭遇挖空的趋势也会逆转。	In turn, large companies will receive the benefits of faster innovation, rates of youth unemployment will fall, and the hollowing out of the middle class – and its faith in future living standards – will be reversed.
在与领导国家当局（包括美国和欧洲）密切合作多年后，11月9日FSB发布了《解决剩余破产障碍 》 （ Removing Remaining Obstacles to Resolvability）报告以及大量相关技术文档。	After many years of working closely with leading national authorities (including in the US and Europe), on November 9 the FSB published “Removing Remaining Obstacles to Resolvability,” along with a number of related technical papers.
再这样的背景下，错误的决定可能让中国重新陷入债务-通缩螺旋 — — 其给中国的经济稳定所造成的威胁要远远大于债务-GDP比率的风险。	In this context, a wrong move could tip China back into a debt-deflationary spiral – which would pose a more acute threat to China’s economic stability than the risks stemming from the debt-to-GDP ratio.
一个显而易见的解释是，尽管在构建稳定政府方面取得了巨大进展，但这些国家仍然饱受让私人投资者望而却步的政治风险的影响。	One obvious explanation is that, despite significant progress in building stable governments, these countries remain subject to political risks that scare private investors.
在俄州检察长任上，普鲁伊特曾经多次起诉EPA，现在，他准备削减EPA的预算，撤销多项监管措施，包括对确保食品安全至关重要的农药监管措施。	Pruitt, who sued the EPA many times in his previous job, seems intent on slashing its budget and dismantling many of its regulations, including those for pesticides, which are essential to ensuring food safety.
当那些小国对希拉克的伊拉克政策表示不同意见时候，希拉克通过让他们“闭嘴”明确地表示出了他对这些小国的态度。	Chirac made it perfectly clear how he feels about the new smaller countries when he told them to “shut up” when they disagreed with him over Iraq.
还有就是发起区域全面经济伙伴关系，目前由东盟及六个合作伙​​伴（澳大利亚，中国，印度，日本，韩国和新西兰）正在谈判的自由贸易协定将是朝这个方向迈出的重要一步。	Launching the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free-trade agreement currently being negotiated by ASEAN and six partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand), would be an important step in this direction.
埃塞克斯大学和澳大利亚国立大学的蒂莫西·哈顿（Timothy J. Hatton）的一篇文章考察了全球难民流以研究背后的驱动因素。	One of the papers, by Timothy J. Hatton of the University of Essex and Australian National University, examined refugee flows around the world, to see what drives them.
但如果大国之间发生了分裂的话，那么即便是G20这样的网络组织也无法为联合国或者布雷顿森林金融机构设定议程。	But if major countries are divided, it is unlikely that even network organizations like the G-20 can set the agenda for the UN and the Bretton Woods financial institutions to act upon.
1809年，杜兰尼的后代被迫让出克西努尔，进贡给强大的旁遮普锡克大君兰吉特·辛格（Ranjit Singh ） 。	In 1809, one of Durrani’s descendants was obliged to cede the Kohinoor in tribute to the powerful Sikh Maharaja of Punjab, Ranjit Singh.
比如，挪威不但是全世界最富裕的国家之一；也是第七大二氧化碳排放输出国，它仍在允许勘探和开发新的石油和天然气田。	Norway, for example, is not just one of the world’s richest countries; it is also the seventh-largest exporter of carbon dioxide emissions, and it continues to permit exploration and development of new oil and gas fields.
2011年4月，突尼斯妇女成功地施压通过了选举公平法，这使得她们在去年10月的选举中赢得了217个议会席位中的49席。	In April 2011, Tunisian women successfully pressed for an electoral-parity law, thanks to which they won 49 of 217 parliamentary seats in last October’s elections.
中国积极参与阿富汗事务的程度将在很大程度上取决于其能否摒弃当前的这种零和博弈思维，并通过稳定阿富汗局势来协助美国的撤军行动。	The extent to which China will engage Afghanistan positively will depend in large part on whether China rids itself of the prevailing zero-sum mindset and facilitates America’s military withdrawal by doing what it can to stabilize the country.
通过专注特定能力素养、而不是花在课堂上的时间，西部州长大学实现了以低廉的价格提供灵活的教育服务；一套全日制课程，包括教材和导师，每年仅需收取约6，000美元的费用。	By focusing on the attainment of specific competencies, rather than on the amount of time spent in a classroom, WGU has been able to offer flexibility at bargain rates; a full-time program, including textbooks and a mentor, costs about $6,000 a year.
而且，美联储认为贸易赤字有助于抑制通货膨胀，而政坛人物现在将贸易赤字视为收买受到工资停滞之苦的消费者的办法。	Moreover, the Federal Reserve has viewed trade deficits as a helpful brake on inflation, while politicians now view them as a way to buy off consumers afflicted by wage stagnation.
如今美国建立了巨大的金融机构系统以促进房屋拥有，经济学家、银行家、政客，当然还有屋主本身，都热切地追踪者房价指标。	Today, the United States has built a mammoth financial bureaucracy to promote homeownership, and economists, bankers, politicians, and of course homeowners themselves keenly follow house-price indicators.
今天，俄罗斯利用同样的逻辑来为与阿富汗塔利班的合作寻找理由，它希望塔利班势力继续打击由美国支持的动荡的喀布尔政府。	Today, Russia is using the same logic to justify its cooperation with the Afghan Taliban, which it wants to keep fighting the unstable US-backed government in Kabul.
看来，抢救大保险公司AIG和禁止所有的卖空金融类股似乎还不够，现在美国财政部长保尔森建议购买（用纳税人的钱）金融界的不良资产。	As if rescuing the big insurer AIG and prohibiting all short selling of financial stocks was not enough, now US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposes buying up (with taxpayers’ money) the distressed assets of the financial sector.
即便政府有计划在明年恢复向外国借贷，但当今的俄罗斯也几经不像上世纪80，90年代那样背负着外国银行或者国际组织的债务了。	And, unlike in the late 1980’s and 1990’s, Russia is not indebted to foreign banks or international organizations, though it plans to resume foreign borrowing next year.
普京统治下，除了限制自由以及克里姆林宫官僚权力急剧扩大外，俄国的中产阶级崛起，日益类似于西方的中产阶级。	Along with its restraints on liberty and its dramatic increase in the power of the Kremlin bureaucracy, Putin has overseen the rise of a Russian middle class that has become increasingly similar to Western middle classes.
值得一提的是，2月将具有战略意义的瓜达尔港控制权移交中国时，巴基斯坦已允许中国政府在那里建立海军基地。	Notably, in giving China control of its strategic Gwadar port in February, Pakistan has permitted the Chinese government to build a naval base there.
有一个简单（或许称得上激进）的解决办法：废除就业合同期限的法律规定，将终身职位和资历的处理退还给集体谈判，就像别的地方一样。	There is a simple, if radical, solution: abrogate the legal provisions that regulate the duration of employment contracts, and return the treatment of tenure and seniority to collective bargaining, as is the case elsewhere.
由于源自高油价的宏观经济压力得到了缓解，资产价格暴涨后的急剧回调得到了遏制，印度眼看就要回归全球增长最快的主要经济体行列。	Provided that macroeconomic pressures from high oil prices are contained, and sharp corrections to elevated asset prices are managed, India is poised to regain its status as the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
Digital Mirror — — 加上夏洛克写的一本叫《网上行为习惯》的书作为延伸说明 — — 可以用来进行自我分析或者团体分析。	Digital Mirror – along with a book written by Charnock called E-Habits, which serves as a kind of extended documentation – can be used for self-analysis or analysis of the local ecosystem.
当维也纳的红衣主教克里斯托弗·施波恩对那些自认为是罗马天主教信徒的人们质疑达尔文主义和进化论理论是否可以接受时，欧洲开始了其美国式的有关生命起源的辩论。	Europe began its own American-style debate on the origins of life when Cardinal Christoph Schönborn of Vienna cast doubt on the acceptability of Darwinism and evolutionary theory to people who see themselves as faithful Roman Catholics.
内綏尔认为什叶派是伊斯兰教的固有组成部分，并试图平等对待他的所有子民，在他统治期间，宗派紧张大为缓和。	The rule of al-Nasir – who viewed the Shia as an intrinsic part of the Islamic community and sought to treat all of his subjects equally – was characterized by a marked decrease in sectarian tensions.
塔鲁罗正确地没有将限制银行规模视为万灵丹 — — 他在演讲中清楚地指出，任何金融系统都会有各种潜在风险。	Tarullo rightly does not regard limiting bank size as a panacea – his speech made it clear that there are many potential risks to any financial system.
通过准确跟踪儿童死亡原因，我们可以更加精准地对症下药，开启一个新时代 — — 一个可预防儿童死亡真正成为历史的时代。	By accurately tracking the causes of child mortality, we can target treatments more precisely and usher in a new era – one in which preventable child deaths really will be a thing of the past.
鉴于树木的重要影响高度地方化，我们发现巴基斯坦、印度、南亚及东南亚其它地区人口稠密的大城市从中受益最多。	Given that the most significant effects of trees are highly localized, we found that densely populated megacities in Pakistan, India, and other parts of South and Southeast Asia would benefit most.
高克的演讲反映了一篇重要新报告道中的思想。 这篇报告由政治和科学基金会（Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik）以及美国德国马歇尔基金会（German Marshall Fund of the United States ） ， 题目是《新大国、新责任 》 （ New Power, New Responsibility ） 。	Gauck’s speech reflected the thinking in an important new report, entitled New Power, New Responsibility, released by the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik and the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
前一次中东逊尼派-什叶派大斗争则是几乎横亘整个16和17世纪的逊尼派奥斯曼帝国和伊朗的什叶派萨菲帝国战争。	Prior to that, the last great Sunni-Shia battle in the Middle East involved near-constant war between the Sunni Ottoman Empire and Iran’s Shia Safavid Empire during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
相比之下，受访者低估了北部各州的社会流动性 — — 包括佛蒙特，蒙大纳，北达科他，南达科他和华盛顿。	By contrast, respondents underestimate social mobility in northern states – including Vermont, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Washington – where it is higher.
（应该指出，考虑到碳循环反馈（如冻土解冻 ） ， 即使今天就消灭排放，世界温度上升幅度仍可能达到1.5℃。 ）	(It should be noted that, given carbon-cycle feedbacks, such as the thawing of permafrost, there is a chance that the world would face a 1.5°C rise, even if emissions were eliminated today.)
更近距离地学习老牌机构的经验 — — 包括怎样与公民社会组织合作、怎样增加政策的地方所有权等 — — 有助于中国精炼其在非洲和其他地区的参与战略。	A closer look at the experiences of long-standing institutions – including working with civil-society groups and promoting local ownership of policies – will help China hone its strategy for engagement in Africa and elsewhere.
事实上，许多俄罗斯人担忧美国打击俄罗斯的核威慑力和其他国防资产（它们取决于美国远程精确制导常规武器数量的不断增加）与核打击等量齐观。	Indeed, many in Russia worry that a US attack against Russia’s nuclear deterrent and other defense assets that relies on America’s growing stock of long-range, precision-guided conventional weapons would be as devastating as a nuclear strike.
德国工业联合会明确坚定地阐述了难民对于商界的好处，并对德国的劳动法规，包括快速完成新移民工作权的审批提出了修改建议。	The BDI has spoken clearly and decisively about the benefits of refugees for business and has proposed changes to Germany’s labor laws and regulations, including fast-tracking the newcomers’ right to work.
对于不是那么贵的鞋子，由于投入到生产过程中无形的部分的资金比较少，这个数字不是那么高，但是仍然超过了50 % 。	For less expensive shoes, with lower sums invested in the intangible parts of the production process, this figure was not as high, but still more than 50%.
但是，中国在重演其暗中渗透争议领土然后以调停者面目出现的故技，提出要以“耐心”和“谈判”帮助解决最新的“问题 ” 。	Yet, in a replay of its old strategy of furtively encroaching on disputed land and then presenting itself as the conciliator, China now counsels “patience” and “negotiations” to help resolve the latest “issue.”
这个方案－在最近的欧盟理事会上被作为谈判的基础通过－总体上允许一些成员国可以不履行它们按理应当履行的京都议定书排放量分担目标。	This approach – endorsed as a basis for negotiation in the recent EU Council – amounted to allowing some member states not to fulfill their supposedly binding Kyoto burden-sharing targets.
发自新德里 — — 2007-2010年金融危机的其中一个正面效应就是让我们认识到：金融产品可以像药品一样复杂而危险。	NEW DELHI – One positive fallout of the financial crisis of 2007-201? is our realization that financial products can be as complex and dangerous as drugs.
不久之后谢里夫接任首相，但他的第一个任期于1993年以在军方压力下辞职而告终，也为布托的回归铺平了道路，后者的总理任期一直延续到1996年，直到再次被罢免 — — 只不过这次出手的是她本人所属的巴基斯坦人民党。	His first term ended in 1993, when he resigned under military pressure. That cleared the way for the return of Bhutto, who remained prime minister until 1996, when she was dismissed yet again – this time, by her own Pakistan Peoples Party.
亲爱的伊朗：很抱歉，特朗普让美国退出了全面联合行动计划（核协议的全称 ） ， 现在又准备重新采取制裁，尽管你们已经证实遵守了协议条款。	Dear Iran: We are sorry that Trump has withdrawn the US from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the nuclear deal is known, and is now re-imposing sanctions, even though you have verifiably abided by the agreed terms.
这也是国际公众舆论认识到该岛还存在难民问题的有数几个场合之一，究其原因，已经很少有人知道这场战争中仍然有难民存在。	This was also one of the few occasions when international public opinion became aware that there was a refugee problem on the island, because few people knew that refugees from that war still exist.
出于某些原因 — — 也许与纽约大学的乔纳森·海特（Jonathan Haidt）所谓的“正义思维”的性质有关 — — 我们的道德情绪与面对伤害和不公时的感同身受有很大关系。	For some reason – probably related to the nature of what NYU’s Jonathan Haidt calls our “righteous minds” – our moral sentiments are strongly related to feelings of empathy in the face of harm and unfairness.
全民基本收入的吸引力来自三个关键特征：它为全体公民提供一个基本社会“底线 ” ； 它让人们自己决定如何使用这一支持；它可以帮助精简许多社会支持计划所需要依靠的官僚。	The appeal of a UBI is rooted in three key features: it provides a basic social “floor” to all citizens; it lets people choose how to use that support; and it could help to streamline the bureaucracy on which many social-support programs depend.
当年大萧条开始的时候，许多人担心保护主义会抬起它丑恶的头颅。 的确，20国集团（G20）领导人承诺，他们已经从大萧条中吸收教训。	Continuing economic weakness in the advanced economies risks a new round of protectionism.
此外，日本在使老年人能够更长时间保持经济活力的技术以及使用更少工人去生产商品和服务的机器人技术方面位居世界前列。	Moreover, Japan leads the world in the technologies that can enable older people to remain economically active longer, and in the robotics that allow goods and services to be produced by ever fewer workers.
在所有这些问题上，以色列和巴勒斯坦立场之间的分歧自2000年戴维营谈判破裂以来并未缩小，而双方的恐惧和不信任却与日俱增。	On all of these issues, the gulf between the Israeli and Palestinian positions has not narrowed since the failed negotiations at Camp David in 2000, while fear and distrust have increased.
在南非的邻国博茨瓦纳和纳米比亚为其大多数感染HIV病毒的国民提供抗逆转录酶病毒药物的时候，在姆贝基领导下的南非没有这样做。	While Botswana and Namibia, South Africa’s neighbors, provided anti-retrovirals to the majority of its citizens infected by HIV, South Africa under Mbeki failed to do so.
Karni Sena组织砸毁了位于斋普尔斋格尔堡（Jaigarh Fort）的电影拍摄布景，并追到科拉普尔（Kohlapur）的新（ 更不“真实 ” ） 拍摄地干扰拍摄，指责班萨利加入印度教女王和穆斯林入侵者的感情线。	The Karni Sena trashed the film set at Jaigarh Fort in Jaipur, and disrupted further shooting in a new (less “authentic”) location at Kohlapur, accusing Bhansali of filming a love scene between the Hindu queen and the Muslim invader.
欧元是一个地区性合成货币（composite currency ） ， 而欧元区的经济增长成绩平平，对这场经济危机的应对也不尽人意。	The euro is the composite currency of an area with a poor growth record and an inadequate response to the economic crisis.
邓小平有一句名言 ， “ 不管黑猫白猫，能抓到老鼠就是好猫 。 ” 这被认为是邓小平坚定务实主义的写照。	Deng, who famously declared, “A cat’s color does not matter as long as it catches mice,” is generally remembered as an unabashed pragmatist.
尽管无数的研究结果表明在“欠发达”国家中的精神疾患康复率远比在“发达国家”的要高，但我们仍然我行我素。	We did so despite numerous studies that show that recovery rates from “mental illness” in “underdeveloped” countries are far superior to those in “advanced” societies.
但这项改革的发布却导致了市场的恐慌，导致人民币汇率在短短四个交易日内下滑了3 % ， 因此很快就被抛弃了。	But the announcement of the reform caused the market to panic, triggering a 3% decline in the renminbi in just four trading days. So it was quickly abandoned.
如果政府的确希望建设更有力、更兼容并蓄的欧洲安全秩序，缓解并最终消除核武器的后果和威胁，这只是部分必须要做的事。	This is only a partial list of what must be done if governments are serious about building a stronger, inclusive European security order, one where the roles and risks of nuclear weapons are reduced, and ultimately eliminated.
英格兰北部和中部的蓝领工人是英国脱欧公投的主要力量，一直以来他们与政治领袖关系疏远、被全球化抛在脑后并且被全球化的所谓代理 — — 欧盟 — — 边缘化。	The Brexit vote was driven by the blue-collar workers of England’s North and Midlands, who have long felt alienated from their political leaders, left behind by globalization, and marginalized by its perceived agent, the EU.
正如上世纪五六十年代时任美联储主席的威廉·麦克切斯尼·马丁（William McChesney Martin）所讽刺的那样，央行的工作就是“在宴会进行时把酒杯收走”��	As William McChesney Martin, who served as Fed Chairman in the 1950’s and 1960’s, once quipped, the central bank’s job is “to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.”
（这一观点毫无疑问反映了一个事实：在总理莫迪领导下，实质性外交政策主要由他和他的幕僚完成，而不是由撒瓦拉伊领导的外交部负责。 ）	(The suggestion undoubtedly reflects the fact that, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, substantive foreign policy is conducted largely by him and his office, rather than by the External Affairs Ministry that Swaraj leads.)
7月14日，国际刑事法院的检察官、阿根廷律师路易斯·莫雷诺奥坎波宣布，他正在寻求逮捕苏丹总统巴希尔的逮捕令，因为他策划了在达尔富尔的暴行。	On July 14, the ICC prosecutor, Argentine lawyer Luis Moreno Ocampo, announced that he was seeking an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for orchestrating the atrocities in Darfur.
相反，他的团队构造了一个复杂而离奇的幻想 — — 它建立在几十年来共和党财政不负责任的基础上并远远过之。	Instead, his team has constructed an elaborate and rather bizarre fantasy – building upon but also going far beyond several decades of Republican fiscal irresponsibility.
但2010年以压倒性优势进入国会的茶党候选人未能兑现其废除“奥巴马医改”和大幅削减联邦开支的承诺，于是进一步加剧了共和党基地选民的怒火。	But the Tea Party candidates who swept into Congress in 2010 failed to deliver on their promises to repeal “Obamacare” and substantially cut federal spending, further inflaming much of the Republican base.
中欧大学现在已经跻身社会科学领域全球前一百名大学之列 — — 这对于学术领域的新加入者是一种令人惊叹的成就。	CEU now ranks among the top 100 universities in the world in the social sciences – a remarkable achievement for an academic newcomer.
1978年以来，通过推进重大改革，中国已经实现了三阶段的全要素生产率高速增长期（每阶段5-7年 ） 。	Since 1978, China, by implementing major reforms, has achieved three periods of high TFP growth, each lasting 5-7 years.
此外，安纳托尔·凯勒茨基（Anatole Kaletsky）强调，十年期美国国债收益率尚未突破3%天花板，而汇率也几乎岿然不动，所有这些表明通胀流言被大大夸大了。	And, as Anatole Kaletsky has stressed, ten-year Treasury yields did not break the 3% ceiling, while exchange rates hardly moved, all of which suggests that rumors of inflation have been greatly exaggerated.
与此同时，一项原本旨在通过禁止赤字在十年内增加超过1.5万亿美元以确保政府能负起财政责任的国会裁定已沦为逃避第11年及随后年份责任的会计技巧。	Meanwhile, a congressional rule that was intended to ensure fiscal responsibility by prohibiting deficit increases above $1.5 trillion within a ten-year window has become an accounting trick to escape responsibility for the 11th year and beyond.
这类清晰胶子结构的出现其实是意料之外的；德国电子同步加速器研究所的实验本身并非为此而设计，但测量强相互作用力的精确实验可以通过已有技术来设计建造。	The appearance of such clear gluonic structures was unexpected; the experiments at HERA were not designed to study them. But the precision experiments required to measure the strong force can be designed and built with known technology.
另一些科学家在寻找对违反某些对称性的现象，这一现象让正常情况下不会发生的粒子衰减能够发生。 其他科学家在寻找引力波检测器中的噪声或难以解释的量子相干性的丧失。	Others are looking for violations of certain symmetries that could enable normally forbidden particle decays, unexplained noise in gravitational wave detectors, or inexplicable loss of quantum coherence.
尽管如此，向政府明确时间长度超过选举周期的要求能够让立法日程更加从长计议，因为它们减少了党派政策交替。	Nonetheless, establishing commitments for governments that extend beyond electoral cycles can imbue legislative agendas with a longer-term perspective, as they reduce partisan policy turnover.
在农民市场中，有大量土豆没卖出去的卖家开始降价，直到价格达到所有土豆都被买走的程度（可能非常低，但仍为正 ） 。	In a farmers’ market, sellers with many unsold potatoes start dropping the price until a level is reached (possibly very low, but still positive) at which all of the potatoes are bought.
主要反对平派领导人印度人民党（BJP）的莫迪（Narendra Modi）激进地声称继承了印度最受尊敬的开国元勋之一帕特尔（Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel）的衣钵。	The main opposition leader, Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has moved aggressively to lay claim to the legacy of one of India’s most respected founders, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
取代前总审计长塔基亚娜·戈利科娃（Tatyana Golikova，顺从但高度不够）的库尔丁与梅德韦杰夫形成了有趣的对比。	Kudrin, who replaces the former Accounts Chamber chair Tatyana Golikova (who was obedient but lacking in stature), provides a curious counterbalance to Medvedev.
在做了类似的比较后 ， 《 经济学人 》 （ The Economist）做出的结论是“1914年和现在最令人警惕的相似之处是自满 。 ”	After drawing a similar comparison, The Economist concludes that “the most troubling similarity between 1914 and now is complacency.”
电脑计算能力的跃进使美国那些“大个子”零售商 — — 沃尔玛、 斯台普斯、 家得宝等等 — — 取代了夫妻店和 1950 ~1960 年代建立的零售链条。	The advent of computing power enabled “big box” retailers in the US – Walmart, Staples, Home Depot, and others – to supplant both mom-and-pop stores and the established retail chains of the 1950s and 1960s.
应当承认，我的视野里涂满了象棋世界的色彩，我曾以一种专业的水平玩这个游戏，但如今与这一水平差距甚远。	In 1996 and 1997, World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov played a pair of matches against an IBM computer named “Deep Blue.” At the time, Kasparov dominated world chess, in the same way that Tiger Woods – at least until recently – has dominated golf.
尽管意大利曾经是坚定的欧盟支持者，但如今许多意大利人支持退出一体化，特别是在6月的英国退欧公投树立了高调的榜样之后。	While Italy was once a staunchly pro-EU country, many Italians may now support less integration, especially after the high-profile example set by the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum in June.
医生曾经是医院的管理者，但今天只有5%的美国医院由医生出任首席执行官，而管理英国医院的医生则更是少之又少。	Hospitals used to be run by doctors; today, only 5% of US hospitals’ CEOs are medical doctors, and even fewer doctors run UK hospitals.
与石油出口不同（石油出口收入被欠中国和其他国家的巨额债务占用 ） ， 非法毒品出口的收入天然不会被占用（除了及其偶尔发生的没收之外 ） 。	And, unlike oil exports, which are encumbered by massive debts to China and others, the proceeds from the illegal drug exports are by nature unencumbered, except in rare instances of seizure.
伯南克否定了那些关于商品价格和新兴市场通胀的抱怨，认为这些状况更多地来源于对货币政策的错误运用以及那些高速发展经济体过度僵化的汇率管制。	Bernanke dismissed complaints about commodity prices and emerging-market inflation, arguing that these phenomena had far more to do with lax monetary policies and overly rigid exchange rates in fast-growing developing economies.
2008年全球发生凶杀案共计418,000起，太多国家有记录的谋杀率达到100，000分之10以上。 世卫组织将其视为一种传染病。	In 2008, there were 418,000 homicides around the world, with far too many countries recording a murder rate of more than 10 per 100,000, which the World Health Organization regards as an epidemic.
有些人可能会怀疑希腊的债务其实是可持续的，因为该国政府所以支付的利息比葡萄牙和意大利这两个债务水平远低于希腊的国家所需支付的更少。	Some might suspect that Greece’s debt is sustainable, since the Greek government has to pay less in interest than Portugal or Italy, both of which have much lower debt levels.
同样，在伊斯坦布尔，2007年老旧汽车站及政府大楼的拍卖创收15亿美元 — — 超过该市2005年的基础设施投资总额。	Similarly, in Istanbul, the auction of an old bus station and government building in 2007 generated $1.5 billion – more than the city’s total expenditures and infrastructure investments in 2005.
新报告强调了在《对生活的错误测量》中只是略作提及的几个方面，如信任和不安全，也更加深入地探讨了一些其他方面，如不平等性和可持续性。	The new report highlights several topics, like trust and insecurity, which had been only briefly addressed by Mismeasuring Our Lives, and explores several others, like inequality and sustainability, more deeply.
过去两个月来，数千名最狂热的洛佩斯支持者们把墨西哥城的中心广场实际上变成了一个帐篷的海洋，使之成为反对官方大选结果的重心。	For the past two months, thousands of Lopez Obrador’s most fervent supporters have transformed the Zocalo, Mexico City’s central square, into a virtual sea of tents – the center of gravity of opposition to the official result.
对俄罗斯的经济制裁或许最终会形成伤害，克里姆林宫可能停止进一步的侵略；但乌克兰危机在短期几乎不可能由外部干预。	Economic sanctions on Russia may eventually hurt, and the Kremlin may desist from further encroachment; but the Ukrainian crisis is largely impervious, in the short term, to outside involvement.
而欧洲大部分国家以及其他地区国家的政府所采用的紧缩政策以及个人消费支出的缩减，都可能导致一场全球性衰退。	The austerity plans being adopted by governments in much of Europe and elsewhere around the world, and the curtailment of consumption expenditure by individuals as well, threaten to produce a global recession.
多数政治文化能够也确实随时间的推移而改变，因为它们在某种程度上受到新的机遇、威胁和宏观社会环境的影响。	Most political cultures can and do change over time, because to some extent they are socially constructed by new opportunities, threats, and contexts generally.
此外，由于低利率降低了资产管理者的回报，一些央行 — — 特别是欧洲央行 — — 依靠一轮又一轮的降息试图推动资产价格虚假上涨。	And, because low interest rates have reduced asset managers’ returns, some central banks – and the European Central Bank, in particular – have relied on successive interest-rate cuts in an effort to engineer ersatz value gains for assets.
欧洲机构在庆祝希腊“干净退出”的同时，保留了对希腊政府的铁腕控制，也不会进行债务重组，这再次彰显出它们发明新词的“功力 ” 。	In celebrating Greece’s “clean exit,” while retaining its iron grip on the Greek government and withholding debt restructuring, Europe’s establishment is once again displaying its skill at inventing neologisms.
我们早已意识到，这一进程充满未知变数，但如果我们连试都不试，这些已经意识到的未知数必将继续挑战一切局部性的解决方案。	It’s an equation with very many known unknowns, but if we do not try at least to mitigate these issues, the known unknowns will continue challenging all partial solutions.
事实证明中央银行的独立性以及预算财政的“不透支”原则往往会对阿富汗地区某些关键和平行动带来过度的限制。	The independence of the central bank and the “no overdraft” rule for budget financing will almost certainly prove too restrictive to carry out critical peace-supporting activities in Afghanistan.
2005年，伍德罗威尔逊国际学者中心新兴纳米技术计划考察了由政府资助的对于纳米技术的环境、健康和安全影响的研究项目。	In 2005, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies looked closely at government-funded research addressing the environmental, health, and safety impact of nanotechnology.
特朗普显然对奥巴马政府在任期末尾紧急再度任命其选定的金墉（Jim Yong Kim）担任世界银行行长的做法相当不满。	Trump can’t be pleased that the Obama administration rushed to push through the reappointment of its chosen World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim.
但顾客对于那些减少供应、突然提价、鲸吞竞争对手或一如Gazprom和俄罗斯的其他国有公司一样故意减产的供应商并不信任。	But customers do not trust suppliers who cut deliveries, raise prices unpredictably, expropriate competitors, and let production decrease in the way Gazprom and Russia’s other state companies have done.
比如，在欧洲，英国独立党（Independency Party）等民族主义政党支持率节节攀升，苏格兰 和 加泰罗尼亚等地的自决呼声也一浪高过一浪。	Europe, for example, is witnessing an upsurge in support for nationalist parties, like Britain’s UK Independence Party, and increasingly loud calls for self-determination, such as in Scotland and Catalonia.
这一立场已经付出了一个沉重的代价：如能有一个更具竞争性的理念市场，那个有缺陷的华盛顿共识可能永远都不会成为一个共识。	This position has already exacted a heavy price: had there been a more competitive marketplace of ideas, the flawed Washington Consensus might never have become a consensus at all.
研究表明，如果不能强化土地权利，特别是女性的土地权利，就无法减少贫困，改善营养，或实现其他关键发展目标。	Studies show there is no way to reduce poverty, improve nutrition, or achieve other key development goals without strengthening land rights, especially for women.
反击必须在受到攻击后以自卫为目的，或者为了应对可能发生的直接威胁而采取自卫行动，无论是上述哪种情况，都不可能有时间去讨论非致命的替代行动。	They must be conducted either in self-defense after an attack, or in anticipatory self-defense against an immediate threat, when taking time to discuss non-lethal alternatives is not feasible.
在奥巴马医保前，美国实施的体系达不到这一标准，无保险覆盖者不但给自己造成了成本，也给其他美国人造成了成本。	The system the US had before Obamacare did not meet that standard, as the uninsured imposed costs not just on themselves, but also on other Americans.
在最近的采访中 — — 包括《纽约客 》 （ The New Yorker）的采访 — — 美联储主席珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）至少表达了对金融行业行为以及大银行脆弱性的总体顾虑。	In recent interviews, including with The New Yorker, Fed Chair Janet Yellen has indicated at least general concerns about financial-sector behavior and the vulnerability of big banks.
欧洲最终要么迈向更深层次的政治、财政和政策一体化，要么迈向包括适应生产率分化的调整机制 — — 比如更大的劳动力流动性 — — 在内的结构。	Europe eventually must gravitate either toward deeper political, fiscal, and policy integration, or toward a structure that includes adjustment mechanisms – for example, greater labor mobility – to accommodate divergences in productivity.
在2006年法国学生示威运动期间，该国22%的年轻人失业率比英国、美国和德国严重多了，后三者的数字分别为11 % 、 12%和13 % 。	During the 2006 French student protests, France’s 22% youth unemployment rate appeared to compare unfavorably to rates of 11%, 12%, and 13% in the United Kingdom, the US, and Germany, respectively.
几乎所有OAS成员国都有专家参与报告的起草。 报告分为两部分：一是出色的分析部分，而是颇可气人的关于未来前景的简报。	The report was drawn up by experts from almost all OAS member states, and was divided into two parts: an excellent analytical section, and a brief and somewhat exasperating chapter devoted to future scenarios.
而如果把北京大学和清华大学两所高校加在一起的话，那么这个联合体最近已经成功超越了加州大学伯克利分校，成为攻读美国博士学位学生的最大来源了。	Tsinghua and Peking universities together recently surpassed Berkeley as the top sources of students who go on to earn American PhDs.
现在，经济学家之间的分歧反映的并非对经济状态的不同立场，而是对宏观经济政策是否提供了有效疗方的不同看法。	Disagreement among economists nowadays reflects different positions not so much on the state of the economy, but on whether macroeconomic policy can provide an effective cure.
虽然他无法对美国造成自己想要的破坏，但他成功占据了全球议程近十年时间，而美国最初的笨拙反应也证明此人能令美国付出比预料中更大的成本。	He was not able to do as much damage to the US as he hoped, but he managed to dominate the world agenda for a decade, and the ineptness of the initial American reaction meant that he could impose larger costs on the US than were necessary.
我最近观看了一个名为“5ivePoints”的公司的介绍会，该公司致力于帮助那些正在进行选举行动的人（通常是没什么财源背景的志愿者）通过Facebook，推特，Google+以及其他朋友扩大影响。	I recently saw a presentation by a company called 5ivePoints, which helps people running campaigns, often volunteers, reach out to their Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and other friends.
当华盛顿最终认识到除非地区构架发生变化，否则伊拉克战争不仅没有战胜者，甚至就连最基本的局势稳定都将成为奢望的时候已经迟了¾或许是太迟了。	Washington’s realization that Iraq can no longer be won or even stabilized unless the regional framework changes, has come late – perhaps too late.
如果想提高其游说能力的话，它必须变得更象一个草根活动家，言辞犀利，政策明确，拥有有利于电视传播的观点。	If it is to improve its persuasive capabilities, it must learn to become more like grassroots activists, with punchy prose, clear policy recommendations, and TV-ready talking points.
几乎在人类基因组初稿完成的同时，IBM宣布新的超级计算机研制成功，对人类基因的运算能力提高到每秒73000亿次。	Around the same time that the first draft of the human genome was being completed, IBM announced the development of a new Super Computer capable of performing 7.3 trillion calculations per second on human DNA.
在奥地利和法国，不信任欧洲的反移民民粹主义政党已经获得了足够的支持，拥有了掌握权力的真正机会，意大利更加左翼的五星运动情况也非常类似。	In Austria and France, Euroskeptic, anti-immigrant populist parties have gained enough support to have a real chance of winning power, as has Italy’s more left-wing Five Star Movement.
但对于那些有能力扩大投资的国家，特别是那些以毫无价值的短期美国国库券的形式持有过量的、可用于发展的宝贵美元的国家，是时候重新评估风险平衡了。	But for countries that have scope to invest more, particularly those that are holding a surfeit of precious development dollars in idle US Treasury bills, the time may be ripe to reassess the balance of risks.
大西洋两岸的商业领袖相信，成功的TTIP协议将带来巨大的经济收益 — — 许多研究都强化了这一感觉。	Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are convinced that a successful TTIP agreement would bring substantial economic benefits – a perception that many studies reinforce.
但是，如欧洲社会和环境责任科学家网络（European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility，ENSSER）主席安吉里卡·希尔贝克（Angelika Hilbeck）所言，更好的问题是 ： “ 它还能做什么 ？ ”	But, as Angelika Hilbeck, President of the European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility (ENSSER) argues, a better question would be: “What else does it do?”
作为一项地缘政治战略，在缅甸担当积极的主导作用可以使中国让它的邻国确信它的“和平崛起”政策是真实的并且有益的。	As a matter of geo-political strategy, taking a positive lead in Burma can help China reassure its neighbors that its policy of a “peaceful rise” is real and beneficial.
最显著的指标是仍拥有自身货币控制权的英国国债收益率创下了历史新低，而西班牙债券的风险溢价创出了历史新高。	Most telling is that Britain, which retained control of its currency, enjoys the lowest yields in its history, while the risk premium on Spanish bonds is at a new high.
他们指的是日益拉大的收入差距，这一点在新奥尔良遭受飓风袭击后传送到世界各地的电视画面中已经有了清楚地证明。	They point to worsening income inequality, as images beamed worldwide from post-hurricane New Orleans illustrated all too clearly.
加州克莱蒙特 — — 随着审判秀的进行，以神气活现、面对媒体应付自如著称的前中共重庆市委书记薄熙来为主角的这场闹剧出人意料地演变成了即兴表演。	CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – As show trials go, the drama featuring Bo Xilai, the once-swaggering, media-savvy former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) chief of Chongqing, veered anomalously into improvisation.
而奇怪的是，从国民党分裂出来的亲民党候选人宋楚瑜的优异表现帮助了马英九，因为前者提供了一个马英九之外的第二选项（因此那些不喜欢马英九的选民也不一定非要投给蔡英文 ） 。	Paradoxically, the strong performance of James Soong Chu-yu of the People First Party, which split from the Kuomintang, helped Ma by giving voters a second alternative to him.
在这方面，消费者必须明白，转基因作物潜力无穷而风险微不足道，政府必须采取实事求是的监管政策，拒绝病态科学。	To that end, consumers must understand that GM crops hold great potential, while posing negligible risks, and governments must adopt regulatory policies that face facts and reject pathological science.
比如，2008年中国修改劳动法后，苹果、惠普和其他中美贸易委员会（US-China Business Council）成员成功地游说限制了中国劳工权利的扩大。	For example, when China revised its labor law in 2008, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and other members of the US-China Business Council lobbied successfully to limit the expansion of Chinese workers’ rights.
中国政府需要更努力地通过常规手段实现经济再平衡，但与此同时也应该更关注调整总资产和总负债的货币结构。	While China’s government should make greater efforts to rebalance the economy by conventional measures, it also should focus more attention on adjusting the currency structure of the country’s gross assets and gross liabilities.
没有人愿意重复布什总统领导下美国的错误；但利用那些错误作为逃避直面世界的借口只能是错误的另外一种表现形式。	No one wants to repeat the errors of the US under President George W. Bush; but to use those errors as an alibi to avoid confronting the world as it is would merely be an error of a different sort.
一种偏重于两个超级大国在危机中相对利益的重要程度：与苏联相比美国不仅在邻国古巴拥有更大的利益，还可以更多地利用传统军事力量。	One focuses on the importance of the two superpowers’ relative stakes in the crisis: the US not only had a greater stake in neighboring Cuba than the Soviets did, but could also bring conventional forces to bear.
在如今这个后危机时代，弥漫在该领域的一致性狂热意味着各国要花费更大的成本来防止货币币值蒸发或者利率突变。	The post-crisis harmonization fervor in this area means that it will now be more costly everywhere in the EU to insure against currency volatility or unexpected changes in interest.
毕竟，他们（或其中一些人）认为，美国实际GDP每年增长4,000亿美元，其中约2,700亿美元用于劳动力，1,300亿美元用作资本。	After all, they (or some of them) argue, the real GDP of the United States is growing by $400 billion per year, with about $270 billion going to labor and $130 billion to capital.
因为美国经济十分强劲，还因为两党政客都支持阻止中国崛起和维护美国全球统治地位的战略目标，令特朗普相信自己在这场冲突中能够占尽优势。	Trump believes that he has the upper hand in this conflict because the US economy is so strong, and also because politicians of both parties support the strategic objective of thwarting China’s rise and preserving US global dominance.
尽管如此，欧洲的盈余仍然很大，不容忽视，特别是德国，它将再次被要求提高内需以实现经济再平衡，许多人认为这意味着财政刺激。	Nonetheless, the European surplus is too large to ignore, and Germany in particular will be asked once more to rebalance its economy toward higher domestic demand, which for many people implies the need for a fiscal boost.
好消息是中国国内需求持续增长，3月的汽车销售额相比去年增长了近10 ％ ， 第一季度的零售支出相比去年同期也提升了10 ％ 。	Car sales were up nearly 10% in March over the same month in 2015. And retail spending grew at an annual clip of 10% in the first quarter.
基加利—想象一个国家，其90%的人口有医保覆盖，90%的艾滋病毒携带者享受长期药物治疗，93%的儿童接种了包括HPV在内的常规传染病疫苗。	KIGALI – Imagine a country where some 90% of the population is covered by health insurance, more than 90% of those with HIV are on a consistent drug regime, and 93% of children are vaccinated against common communicable diseases including HPV.
发自纽约 — — 当美国雷曼兄弟投资银行在2008年破产，引发自大萧条以来最严重的全球金融危机之后，一个关于危机成因的广泛共识似乎已经形成。	NEW YORK – When the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, triggering the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression, a broad consensus about what caused the crisis seemed to emerge.
1945年4月，美国战争部长亨利·史汀生（Henry Stimson）向总统杜鲁门解释，原子弹将是“人类历史上所知道的最可怕的武器 。 ”	In April 1945, US Secretary of War Henry Stimson explained to President Harry Truman that the atomic bomb would be “the most terrible weapon ever known in human history.”
针对我报发起的第二起讼诉案带来了更坏的结果：声称我们报纸破坏了亚美尼亚Mika公司的名誉并对我们处以高达25,000美元的罚金（在这里这可是笔巨款 ） 。	A second trial against our newspaper had worse consequences: a $25,000 fine (a huge sum here) based on allegations that we had damaged the reputation of the Mika Armenia Company, controlled by the so-called Karabakh clan that helps rule Armenia.
如果西方抛弃俄罗斯，这种孤立只会强化目前俄罗斯政治文化中的排外以及中央集权论调，从而使自由事业变得愈加困难。	If the West were to turn its back on Russia, such isolation would reinforce the xenophobic and statist tendencies present in Russian political culture and make the liberal cause more difficult.
人类学家海伦·费舍尔 《爱的解析》 是上述研究中最著名的一项，它解释了人类求爱、结婚、通奸、离婚和抚养子女倾向背后存在的进化动力。	The most famous of these studies, anthropologist Helen Fisher’s The Anatomy of Love , explains the evolutionary impetus for human tendencies in courtship, marriage, adultery, divorce, and childrearing.
这看起来是可信的；同时鉴于页岩油气对美国经济复苏的重要性，美国的政策制定者似乎也希望避免这件事情发生。	That seems plausible; and, given how important shale oil and gas has become to America’s economic recovery, it also seems like something that US policymakers would be eager to avoid.
议会在政治进程中发挥着自己的作用，它能够促进或阻碍政策变化：保守的议会在改革派总统卡塔米任期的最后一年对其施政的阻挠就是例证。	The majlis plays a role in the political process, to the point of being able to induce or hinder policy changes: witness the way a conservative majlis blocked reformist President Mohammad Khatami in the last years of his term.
担当经济失灵时 — — 并且失灵不是暂时性阶段，而是深刻矛盾的症候 — — 资本主义的破坏性社会副作用就会成为政治毒药。	But when the economy fails – and the failure is not just a transient phase but a symptom of deep contradictions – capitalism’s disruptive social side effects can turn politically toxic.
最近加入欧元区的成员国爱沙尼亚也面临相同的状况，该国严格的工资限制保证其短期内在这个单一市场上拥有一定的竞争力。	The same is true for the most recent eurozone member, Estonia, whose rigorous wage restraint ensured competitiveness in the single market in a short period of time.
但是，没过多久，美国就不得不把注意力转向了俄罗斯。 在总统普京的领导下，俄罗斯一直在寻求恢复冷战时期苏丽安娜的地缘政治地位。	Before long, however, the US had to turn its attention to Russia, which under President Vladimir Putin’s leadership has been seeking to recapture the Cold War-era Soviet Union’s geopolitical status.
社会名流克塞尼亚·索伯查克（Ksenia Sobchak）在与普京会面之后宣布她将参选，这或许能够为选战注入一丝活力。	The socialite Ksenia Sobchak, who announced her candidacy after meeting with Putin, may seem able to inject some life into the campaign.
对国企改革进展缓慢的泛泛抱怨也许忽视了一个战略性挑战：在国企和新技术上市企业巨头之间，形成在数字空间的良性竞争。	Superficial complaints about the slow pace of SOE reforms ignore the strategic challenge of creating productive competition between SOEs and publicly listed tech giants in the digital space.
在搬入多民族混居地区的大房子之前，我们住在一套两居室的房子里，这套房子是我父母亲自己建的，我们对此感到十分自豪。	We were proud of the two-room house my parents managed to build before we moved into a larger home in an ethnically mixed area.
这部拍摄于距边境几百英里的新墨西哥州阿尔伯克基（Albuquerque）的电视剧讲述的是高中化学教师沃尔特·怀特（Walter White）变身大毒枭的沉浮史。	Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a few hundred miles from the border, the series chronicles the rise and fall of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a methamphetamine tycoon.
这是评估我们如何调整全球贫困线、估算新贫困数据并将它们发表在今年10月发布的《全球监测报告 》 （ Global Monitoring Report）中的一个原因。	This was one reason to take stock of how we would adjust the global poverty line, estimate new poverty numbers, and publish them in our Global Monitoring Report, which was released in October.
新一轮刺激政策能即刻调动中国的过剩产能和未充分利用的经费（比方说已经完工的不动产资产 ） ， 重现年度GDP 9%的增速。	With a new round of stimulus, China’s excess production capacity and underused outlays (for example, built-up real-estate assets) could be mobilized immediately, restoring 9% annual GDP growth.
事实上，美国可能被这些国家自身的狭隘利益所利用，不管是以色列对其自身安全的无法令人信服的愿景还是逊尼派国家队什叶派伊朗的反对。	In fact, the US has probably been lured into serving these countries’ own narrower interests, whether it be Israel’s unconvincing vision of its own security or the Sunni countries’ opposition to Shia Iran.
希特勒一待时机成熟就吞并了奥地利和捷克斯洛伐克；但1955年后奥地利的中立得到了冷战两大阵营的认可，而奥地利现在已成为欧盟成员国。	Hitler swallowed Austria and Czechoslovakia when it suited him; but Austria's neutrality after 1955 was enough to satisfy the Cold War's two blocs, and now it is part of the EU.
黎巴嫩博客博主吉诺·莱迪（Gino Raidy）写道 ， “ 求求你们，不断发布这些卡通形象，不要停。	The Lebanese blogger Gino Raidy wrote, “Please, publish the cartoons again, and again, and again.
现代研究表明：伟大的经济学家约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter）认为创新竞争会导致公司的更替，这种想法是错误的。	Modern research has shown that the great economist Joseph Schumpeter was wrong in thinking that competition in innovation leads to a succession of firms.
这个错误既不在他们2009年的获奖著作中，也不再后来被广泛传阅的、回应对他们工作的学术争论的论文中。	The error is in neither their prize-winning 2009 book nor in a subsequent widely read paper responding to the academic debate about their work.
考虑到导致危机的全球贸易失衡依然存在，增加竞争力只能获得一场惨胜 — — 而且对各国国内生活水平和消费都会带来惨重打击。	Given that the global imbalances that led to the crisis remain unaddressed, increased competitiveness will be a Pyrrhic victory – and one that will exact a severe toll on domestic living standards and consumption.
但尽管这些政策可以给新兴和发展中国家带来诸多好处，但它们也造成了中国的金砖国家伙伴国的巨大焦虑，担心中国领导很快就会转化为主宰。	But despite such efforts’ potential benefits for emerging and developing economies, they have provoked considerable anxiety among China’s BRICS partners, which fear that its leadership could quickly morph into domination.
与此同时，我们最基本的机构 — — 学校、警察局和法院 — — 必须重新调整以反映和应对我们社区的多样性，这是如今的真实生活。	Meanwhile, our most fundamental institutions – schools, police, and the courts – must be re-engineered to reflect and respond to the diversity of our communities, which is now a fact of life.
后一种模式不但直接压抑了可贸易部门的收入和工资增长，也通过失业劳动力的溢出效应压抑了不可贸易的服务部门。	The latter pattern depressed income and wage growth not only in the tradable sector directly, but also in the non-tradable service sectors, owing to the spillover of displaced labor.
事实上，那场危机的真正成本根本无法用任何中央银行的账面盈亏来衡量 — — 也无法用美国财政部问题资产救助计划（Troubled Asset Relief Program）的一系列行动是赚是亏来进行评估。	The real cost of the crisis is not measured by the profit and loss statement of any central bank – or by whether or not the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), run by the Treasury Department, made or lost money on its various activities.
此外，巴格达迪的原教旨伊斯兰国的残忍性对很多人来说与沙特阿拉伯的行为并没有很大不同，后者花了几十年通过全世界的清真寺和伊斯兰教学校传播其瓦哈比派原教旨主义。	Moreover, the brutality of his fundamentalist Islamic State seems to many not so very different from the behavior of Saudi Arabia, which has spent decades spreading its Wahhabi fundamentalism through mosques and madrassas around the world.
但是，在2009年的哥本哈根会议上，承诺形成全球协定的气候谈判各方食言了，因此，2015年12月的巴黎峰会几乎也必将沦为又一场灾难。	But, with climate negotiators promising to deliver the global agreement that they could not deliver in Copenhagen in 2009, the December 2015 summit in Paris is almost certain to be another debacle.
杀人狂往往都是某种形式的个人复仇 — — 这些失意者们希望让附近的世界领教一下自己的厉害，因为他们感到 — — 不管是在社会生活，工作中还是性方面 — — 被侮辱或者被排斥了。	Murder sprees are more often than not a form of personal revenge – losers wishing to blow up the world around them, because they feel humiliated or rejected, whether socially, professionally, or sexually.
当两国的经济实力正得到越来越多的国际关注之时，相对而言中印之间在其他问题上 — — 从土地到水源，再到对其他区域的地缘政治影响 — — 所存在的潜在战略对峙得到的关注就较少了。	While their economic heft is drawing increasing international attention, their underlying strategic rivalry over issues ranging from land and water to geopolitical influence in other regions usually attracts less notice.
毕竟，这些债务都是契约 — — 也就是说，是自愿签订的协议 — — 因此债权人的责任并不小于与债务人。	After all, such debts are contracts – that is, voluntary agreements – so creditors are just as responsible for them as debtors.
美国的一些维权团体，例如由我共同创立的、十年之久的人权组织支持负责任的护理和研究公民协会（ www.circare.org ）提出了一项普遍使用的全国人体研究对象保护法案。	Advocates in the US, such as the ten-year-old human rights organization, Citizens for Responsible Care and Research (www.circare.org), which I co-founded, have proposed a universal National Human Subjects Protection Act.
2004年11月，欧洲投资银行（EIB）和私人银行法国巴黎银行一起宣布，他们将合作发行世界首张长期寿命债券。	In November 2004, the European Investment Bank (EIB), working with the private bank BNP Paribas, announced that it would issue the world’s first long-term longevity bond.
他还必须明白，什叶派伊朗所输出伊斯兰革命已经失去了吸引力，在逊尼派世界中，它首先被基地组织的全球圣战所取代，现在又被所谓的伊斯兰国和巴格达迪的哈里发所取代。	He must also know that the export of Islamic revolution from Shia Iran has lost its allure, replaced in the Sunni world first by the global jihad of al-Qaeda and now by the so-called Islamic State and caliphate of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
1992年，在各国央行所持有的外汇储备中，大概只有46%是美元，但在2000年这一比例上升到约70 % 。	Central banks held only an estimated 46% of their foreign-exchange reserves in dollars in 1992, but that share rebounded to almost 70% by 2000.
在最近对这个拥有130万人口的热带岛国的访问中，我有机会观察了毛里求斯所实现的飞跃 — — 这些成就在美国以及世界其他地方看来简直有点不可思议。	In a recent visit to this tropical archipelago of 1.3 million people, I had a chance to see some of the leaps Mauritius has taken – accomplishments that can seem bewildering in light of the debate in the US and elsewhere.
“ [ 若]美国为每年支付给直接生产有用商品和直接提供有用服务的人的钱中抠出来的额外的 … … 7500亿美元创造了很好的价值，那么肯定会突出地显示在统计数字中 。 ”	“[I]f the US were getting good value from the extra…$750 billion diverted annually from paying people who make directly useful goods and provide directly useful services, it would be obvious in the statistics.”
但就国际竞争力来说，最基本的一点是特朗普提出的税收计划 — — 特别是边境调整税 — — 很可能不会对美国的贸易平衡产生积极影响。	But in terms of international competitiveness, the bottom line is that Trump’s proposed tax plan – particularly the border-adjustment tax – would most likely not have a positive impact on the US trade balance.
阻止的办法只有一个：那就是公开探讨经济政策。 只有这样才能发现谬误、为制定有创造性的解决方案创造条件。	There is only one way to prevent this: open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide scope for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today.
其次，逊尼派多数和阿拉维-比克特西派少数之间存在历史对立，后者与什叶派伊斯兰教有着并不��密的联系。	Second, there is an underlying historical tension between the large Sunni majority and the Alevi-Bektashi minority, loosely linked to Shia Islam.
为了充分实现认知时代的好处，我们必须能够处理巨量信息；在未来15年 ， “ 数字上可接触”的数据数量预计将增加1,000多倍。	In order to benefit fully from the Cognitive Era, we will have to be able to harness huge amounts of information; during the next 15 years, the amount of “digitally accessible” data is expected to grow by a factor of more than 1,000.
别说如今在金融圈要找说雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安或他在2014年当选总统前领导的土耳其正义与发展党（AKP）好话的人很难。	Never mind that one would be hard pressed to find anyone in business or financial circles these days with a nice thing to say about Recep Tayyip Erdoğan or the AKP that he led before ascending to the presidency in 2014.
这对它们的德意志欧盟合作伙伴而言，几乎没有造成什么影响。 这倒在意料之中，因为施罗德现在正担任着管道修建财团的主席。	This made little impression on their German EU partners – unsurprisingly, since Schroeder now chairs the consortium that will build the pipeline.
引起众怒后，Reddit在2011年封禁了这个版面。 同样的事情发生在一个名叫“CreepShots ” （ 爬拍）的关于尾随女性的版面身上。	Following a public outcry, Reddit banned the subreddit in 2011, as it did again when the public took notice of a subreddit about stalking women called “CreepShots.”
发自华沙 — — 如果1991年爆发的那场针对米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫的政变成功了的话，那么最近在中国新疆地区发生的暴乱可能将在俄罗斯上演。	WARSAW – Had the August 1991 putsch against Mikhail Gorbachev not failed, the riots and death recently seen in Xinjiang could have been taking place in Russia.
此外，短期国内经济增长很可能受到政策不确定性、财政整顿和改革的直接影响，还需要王国的货币及财政政策立场从支持转变为反对周期。	Moreover, short-term domestic growth is likely to be stifled by policy uncertainty, fiscal consolidation, the immediate impact of reforms, and the needed reversal of the country’s monetary- and fiscal-policy stances, from pro- to counter-cyclical.
显然，宽带服务的快速推进改变了工业化国家人民的生活；有充分的理由期待发展中国家至少也能获得同样的好处。	Clearly, the rapid rollout of broadband services has transformed the lives of people in the industrialized world; there is every reason to expect that developing countries could benefit at least as much.
亲眼目睹了墨西哥在过去15年里的缓慢发展，现在，我们不得不质疑北美自由贸易协定的新自由主义和改革之路是否真是一条通向成功的康庄大道呢？	Having witnessed Mexico’s slow growth over the past 15 years, we can no longer repeat the old mantra that the neo-liberal road of NAFTA and associated reforms is clearly and obviously the right one.
至于中国落后的教育体制，尽管每年的大学毕业生很多，但是因为他们总体上无法达到标准的素质，这一数字没有多大意义。	As for China’s backward educational system, the large number of university graduates is offset by their overall sub-standard quality.
同样重要的是，正如日本与全世界分享其创新产品和技术，日本也能够输出成功的政策，用同样或类似的措施提高其他发达国家的生活水平。	Equally important, just as it has shared its innovative goods and technologies with the world, Japan could end up exporting successful policies, with the same or similar measures increasing standards of living in other advanced countries as well.
关于新开发银行如何运行，还存在许多重大问题有待解决，但早期迹象表明基础设施将是该银行活动的核心领域，而非洲则是重点地区。	There are significant outstanding issues about how the New Development Bank will operate, but early indications suggest that infrastructure will be central to its activities, with an emphasis on Africa.
今天如果英格兰队偶尔赢得一场重大比赛的胜利，人们就将其归功于一种“典型的”英格兰式的斗志和“公平竞赛”精神。	On the rare occasion that England wins a big match these days, victory is attributed to a “typically” English fighting spirit, coupled with “fair play.”
当前的经济复苏相当无力（不管从绝对水平衡量还是从相对大多数预期角度衡量 ） ， 并且主要推动力来自央行出于维持消费目的推出的实验性政策。	The recent economic recovery, as muted as it has been (both in absolute terms and relative to most expectations), has been driven by the experimental policies that central banks have pursued to sustain consumption.
前美国财政部张劳伦斯·萨默斯（Lawrence Summers）主张公共投资是真正的免费午餐，IMF总裁克里斯汀·拉加德（Christine Lagarde）指出如果世界经济要想“克服新平庸”就必须提振投资。	Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers asserted that public investment really is a free lunch, while IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has argued that an investment boost is needed if the world economy is to “overcome a new mediocre.”
任何此类尝试 — — 毫无疑问，它们受到民粹主义和民族主义压力加剧的推动 — — 都会造成严重的经济损失，最终耗竭尝试者的政治资本。	Any attempt to do so – undoubtedly fueled by intensifying populist and nationalist pressures – would cause serious economic damage, ultimately depleting the political capital of those who spearheaded it.
与其接受“爱国”不能被强加而只能感召的观点，过分热情的香港“爱国者们”迫不及待地设法用低劣的宣传手段来表忠心。	Instead of accepting that “love” cannot be enforced and must be won, Hong Kong’s over-zealous “patriots” cannot wait to show their loyalty by trying to mandate primitive propaganda.
另一方面，特朗普可能继续维持自身决策飘忽不定的特质，不去减税，不兴建大型基础设施，甚至连在竞选时承诺修建的墨西哥边境墙都置诸脑后。	On the other hand, Trump might maintain his aura of unpredictability by not pursuing tax cuts, significant infrastructure spending, or even his promised Mexican border wall.
全世界每年在能源和基础设施上花费近7万亿美元；而我们当前的研究和开发工作还不足以解决气候变化的难题。	The world spends nearly $7 trillion a year on energy and its infrastructure; yet our current research and development efforts are not up to meeting the challenge of climate change.
由于中国支付外国技术方面费的规模目前仅次于美国，显然有大量且不断增长的技术转染份额并不是“被迫”的。	With China now second only to the US in terms of paying for foreign technology, it is clear that a large and growing share of technology transfer is not “forced.”
事实上，虽然入盟进程已经为巴尔干各国带来了民主和稳定，但这项至关重要的工作还远未结束，甚至无法确定能否圆满完成。	Indeed, although EU integration is already bringing democracy and stability to the countries of the Balkans, it is an unfinished job, and completing that task is both vital and uncertain.
就连美国 — — 由于担心武装全球圣战分子，美国到目前为止仍拒绝提供致命武器援助 — — 最近也宣布正在起草向反对派军队提供武器的计划。	Even the United States, which has so far refused to provide lethal aid for fear of arming global jihadis, recently announced that it is working on a plan to deliver weapons to opposition forces.
迄今为止，中国对所有新情况的反应是毫不妥协，坚持与在军事上远逊于自己的东盟成员国在双边基础上解决领土争端。	So far, China’s reaction to all of this new activity has been to dig in its heels and insist on addressing its territorial disputes with ASEAN’s militarily inferior members on a bilateral basis.
正如他所说 ， “ 一个国家的财富不仅仅存在于其金与银两种金属中，也存在于它的土地、房屋以及各种可消费商品中。	As he put it, “the wealth of a country consists, not in its gold and silver only, but in its lands, houses, and consumable goods of all different kinds.”
与此同时，普京全力以赴地要保证自己的长期统治，确保自己不会重蹈其基辅代理人、前乌克兰总统亚努科维奇的覆辙。	At the same time, Putin is preoccupied with perpetuating his rule and ensuring that he does not suffer the same fate as former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who had been his proxy in Kyiv.
因为原油和天然气的高价所带来的巨额财富，俄罗斯再次对在15年前逃离正在腐蚀的苏联帝国的弱小的国家施展淫威。	With high prices for crude oil and natural gas bloating its coffers, Russia is once again aggressively confronting the small and still relatively weak states that fled the eroding Soviet empire 15 years ago.
因此授权世界货币基金组织去接管陷入困境的跨国银行可以满足这些条件 — — 并且令这场最糟糕的噩梦离我们而去。	Empowering the IMF to take over failed international banks would fill this gap – and chase away our worst nightmare.
此外，即使没有衰退，如果移民持续流入，因而劳动力规模并非一次性扩大，那么劳动需求可能一直滞后于供给的增长。	And, even with no recession, if there is a continuing inflow of migrants, rather than a one-off increase in the size of the labor force, demand for labor may constantly lag behind growth in supply.
更深入理解各种问题和可能的补救措施能使科学在穆斯林世界再度蓬勃发展，并对其经济和社会产生意义深远的影响。	A better understanding of the various issues and possible remedies could enable science to flourish again in the Muslim world, with far-reaching benefits for its economies and societies.
不过，奥巴马成功说服了中国和印度作出明确的减排承诺，同时也设定了美国减排的目标，以防止哥本哈根协议的流产。	But Obama has helped to persuade China and India to announce useful efforts, and he will set an American target of reducing greenhouse emissions that should prevent the conference from being a failure.
因为这些由政客承担的审计可能会被他们视为赚取政治分数或让政策为自身利益服务的机会，其手段则是刻意泄露信息来向政策制定者施压。	Undertaken by politicians, an audit might be viewed as an opportunity to score political points or steer policy in self-serving directions, with delicate information leaked in order to pressure policymakers.
然而，到10月底，M2货币供应上涨了18.4 % ， 同比增长了1.3 % ， 并且远远超过了预期增长16%的目标。	Nevertheless, by the end of October, M2 money supply had increased by 18.4% – growing by 1.3% faster year on year, and exceeding the 16% target.
比如，在美国，新闻组织就业机会在不到十年的时间里减少了近四分之一，而顶级新闻院校的入学人数最近也大幅下降。	In the United States, for example, newsroom employment has dropped nearly one-quarter in less than ten years, while enrollment in top journalism schools has tapered off more recently.
朝鲜政权邀请国际调查员前往宁边，并提供了大量关于宁边核反应堆操作的记录，迄今它们仍然是测算实际制造的钚的数量的最准确的资源。	The regime invited international inspectors to Yongbyon, and provided substantial records of the Yongbyon reactor’s operations, which are still one of the most accurate resources for measuring the amount of plutonium actually produced there.
相比而言，这个十年迄今为止的平均年增长率为3.5 % ， 略低于21世纪第一个十年的平均增长率，但要高于20世纪八九十年代的平均增长率3.3 % 。	By comparison, the average annual growth rate so far this decade has been 3.5%, which is slightly lower than the average rate in the 2000s, but above the 3.3% rate in the 1980s and 1990s.
言下之意是我们必须潜移默化地在我们的家庭、组织和国家中建立有效应对危机时刻所需要的恢复力和工具，从而让意料外变化的潜在破坏力最小化。	The implication is that we must instill in our families, organizations, and states the resilience and tools needed to act effectively in times of crisis – and thus to minimize the potentially damaging impact of unexpected change.
根据自身的工作经验，为熟练工人提供考证机会的项目能够允许尚未得到认证的电工在机器人行业找到正式的工作。	Programs offering skilled workers a chance to earn certifications based on their work experience would allow for, say, uncertified electricians to find formal employment in robotics.
幸运的是，印度洋-太平洋地区的四大关键民主国家 — — 澳大利亚、印度、日本和美国之间的关系比以往任何时候都更加坚挺，高层联络和情报共享彰显出这一点。	Fortunately, relations among the Indo-Pacific’s four key maritime democracies – Australia, India, Japan, and the US – are stronger than ever, characterized by high-level linkages and intelligence-sharing.
虽然小心翼翼地并未对宪法提出公开挑战，从1971到2001年，他们还是相继被视为对世俗主义构成威胁从而遭到取缔。	Though careful not to challenge the constitution openly, from 1971 to 2001, they were successively banned as threats to secularism.
如果决策者实施更加全面的反应措施，是可以让经济走向更稳定和��荣的路径的 — — 即高包容性增长，不平等性下降以及实现真正的金融稳定。	If policymakers implement a more comprehensive response, they can put their economies on a more stable and prosperous path – one of high inclusive growth, declining inequality, and genuine financial stability.
尽管选民明智地选择了他和他的政府而没有投票给保守反对派，但推行一项绝大多数希腊人厌恶的紧缩计划的现实将会考验公众的耐心。	While voters wisely prefer that he and his cabinet, rather than the conservative opposition, implement a program that an overwhelming majority of Greeks detest, the reality of the austerity agenda will test public patience.
但我绝不赞成布什政府的政策，这不仅是因为官员们的语言和行动之间多有差距，还因为他们的语言有时与所作所为恰恰相反，简直是一派奥威尔式的欺人之谈。	Yet I find myself in sharp disagreement with the Bush administration. It is not only that there is a large gap between official words and deeds; I find that the words sometimes directly contradict the deeds in a kind of Orwellian doublespeak.
否则，以美关系将变得紧张，而随着定居点活动破坏两国方案的前景，建立一个平权国家的呼声会逐渐湮没从前的思想愿景。	Otherwise, tension looms in the Israeli-American relationship, and calls for one state with equal rights for all will begin to drown out older ideological visions, as settlement activity forecloses the prospect of two states.
即使有了官方资金援助，要神奇地连下三城 — — 将负债率和赤字率降低到可持续的水平，本币实际贬值以及重启经济增长恐怕也是很难完成的任务。	The magic trifecta of sustainable debt and deficit ratios, a real depreciation, and restoration of growth looks unlikely to be achievable even with official financial support.
如今国内政策选择用尽，经济前景黯淡，必须把注意力重新放在刺激政策之上，并通过对刺激手段时机和内容的全球协同来对其进行扩充。	As domestic policy options have been exhausted, economic prospects have dimmed. A renewed emphasis on stimulus must be augmented by global coordination on the timing and content of stimulus measures.
发自普林斯顿 — — 我们现在对地球，对我们的子孙后代以及穷人的所作所为 — — 肆无忌惮地制造温室气体 — — 是我们这一代人所犯下的最大的道德过失。	PRINCETON – What we are doing to our planet, to our children and grandchildren, and to the poor, by our heedless production of greenhouse gases, is one of the great moral wrongs of our age.
虽然英国癌症研究所在 1995 年就发现了这种基因在导致乳腺及卵巢癌中的作用，但迈里德与其他近 30 名被告一道，称专利是为补偿其必要的研究投入。	Although the gene’s function in causing breast and ovarian cancer was uncovered by Cancer Research UK in 1995, Myriad, along with nearly 30 other defendants, argues that the patent is a necessary reward for its research costs.
如果穆巴拉克及其政府未能提出满足要求的宪法修正案，就会有更多的埃及人脱离现政权，为在其它国家寻求解脱而心甘情愿冒着生命的危险。	Should Mubarak and his government fail to recommend constitutional amendments that satisfy these demands, ever more Egyptians will desert the regime and risk their lives in search of salvation in other lands.
批评者称之为“经济学帝国主义 ” ， 它产生了爱情经济学、艺术经济学、音乐经济学、语言经济学、文学经济学，还有其他各种各样的经济学。	What critics call “economics imperialism” has given rise to an economics of love, of art, of music, of language, of literature, and of much else.
他只把与基地组织有关的Jabhat al-Nusra称为极端主义者（尽管他拒绝接受美国的说法，称该集团为“外国恐怖主组织 ” ） 。	He has labeled only the Al Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra as extremist (though he rejects America’s branding of the group as a “foreign terrorist organization.”)
现在进行套利交易非常诱人，对长期债券而言尤其如此，因为这次的盈亏平衡点出现在几十年来实际汇率最低的时候。	The carry trade today is very attractive, especially for longer-maturity securities, because the break-even point occurs at the most depreciated real exchange rate in decades.
他认为，这将带来分裂和反动政治 ： “ 没有转移支付，你就无法让外围趋同，这将造成走向极端化的政治分歧 。 ”	That, he believes, is a recipe for disintegration and reactionary politics: “Without transfers, you will not allow the periphery to converge and will create political divergence towards extremists.”
各地区治理制度和宪法结构各有不同，必须形成广泛一致才能产生正式行动或是随冲击和条件的变化改变政策方向。	Governance systems and constitutional structures differ in the extent to which they require broad consensus for official action, or to change policy direction in response to shocks or shifting conditions.
没有任何一个数学家能记得如此史无前例且令人叹为观止的结果：随着自主变成相互依赖（至少是在拯救中的短暂一刻 ） ， 平行线相交了。	No mathematician can remember so unprecedented and spectacular a result: parallel lines intersecting, with autonomy becoming (for the brief moment of the bailout at least) interdependence.
麦迪逊—在柏拉图的早期对话集《游叙佛伦篇》中，苏格拉底来到雅典法庭，为自己辩护他腐化雅典青年并且不信神的子虚乌有的指控。	MADISON – In the Euthyphro, one of Plato’s early dialogues, Socrates travels to the Athenian court to defend himself against trumped-up charges that he has corrupted the city’s youth and does not believe in the gods.
对劳动生产率构成部分的拆分分析表明，许多国家（包括美国）生产率增长下降的一半（或以上）因素都可以归因为资本密集度增长放缓。	A breakdown of the components of labor productivity shows that slowing capital-intensity growth contributed about half or more of the decline in productivity growth in many countries, including the US.
所有这些不确定性彰显出亚洲安全基础存在关键缺陷 — — 这些缺陷被该地区的高速经济增长所掩盖，知道最近才显露出来。	All of this uncertainty reveals critical flaws in the Asian century’s foundations – flaws that, until recently, were masked by the region’s rapid economic growth.
像萨默斯这样的人之所以为赤字忧心，是因为他们怀疑政府借来的钱是否最终被用到了可以推动GDP长期增长超过债务增长的手段上。	People like Summers worry about deficits because they doubt that the money the government is borrowing is being spent in ways that will push the long-term growth of GDP above that of the debt.
更广地说，自1946年以来，铜、铝、铁和锌供给都超过了需求，这要归功于新储量的发现和更经济的新提炼技术。	More broadly, since 1946, supplies of copper, aluminum, iron, and zinc have outstripped consumption, owing to the discovery of additional reserves and new technologies to extract them economically.
在最近十年较好的阶段，即我们开始意识到债务驱动的过度扩张迟早会结束时，该指数就一直在下跌，最近的债务危机则加速了下跌。	The decline occurred over the better part of a decade, as we began to see the end of debt-driven overexpansion, and accelerated with the latest debt crisis.
正因如此，从安倍的外祖父岸信介开始，日本民族主义领导人的主要目标一直是通过修改宪法第九条恢复日本的完全主权。	That is why the main goal of nationalist-minded Japanese leaders, starting with Abe’s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, has been the return of full Japanese sovereignty by revising Article 9.
在此基础上，一个单一欧洲银行监督当局将扫清通过欧洲稳定性机制、共同存款保险以及单一破产框架对银行进行直接资本重组的障碍。	Building on this, a single European banking-supervision authority would open the way to direct recapitalization of banks through the European Stability Mechanism, as well as to common deposit insurance and a single resolution framework.
2012年，内阁在未咨询国家生物安全局的情况下发布了转基因作物进口禁令，该决定的基础是一项因为被广泛认定为错误而收回的研究，该研究错误地将转基因粮食与癌症联系起来。	In 2012, the cabinet banned GM crop imports without even consulting the NBA, a decision based on a widely denounced, and since-retracted, study that falsely linked GM foods with cancer.
但我们也许应该回想一下Raskolnikov的一位对话者在提到他混迹其间的“令人厌恶的索多玛”时所讲的话。 他说贫穷不是一种堕落，而苦难才是。	But perhaps we should hear again the words of one of Raskolnikov’s interlocutors when he speaks about the “disgusting Sodome” in which he wanders and says that poverty is not a vice, but misery.
但它并不是许多支持者所鼓吹的那样的免费午餐，因为决策者不可能忽视许多发达国家都存在的高企的政府债务水平。	But it is not a free lunch, as many of its promoters often suggest, because policymakers cannot ignore the high levels of government debt across much of the developed world.
近三年前，前美国财政部长拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）复活了埃尔文·汉森（Alvin Hansen）的“长期停滞”假说，强调需求侧约束。	Almost three years ago, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers revived Alvin Hansen’s “secular stagnation” hypothesis, emphasizing demand-side constraints.
病毒的传播起源于动物种群，而动物体就像病原体发展变异的蓄水池。 研究人员因此很难跟上传染病的变化速度。	These viruses are transmitted from animal populations, which can act as reservoirs where the pathogens can develop and mutate, making it difficult for researchers to keep pace with the diseases’ variations.
在卡特总统任上，美国试图通过外交手段限制ASAT计划，但两大超级大国对于怎样定义空间武器始终莫衷一是。	Under President Jimmy Carter, the US tried diplomacy to limit ASAT programs, but the superpowers couldn’t begin to agree on how to define a space weapon.
热浪来袭期间，印度城市温度即使在夜间也有可能达到极值，从而导致睡眠对那些没有正规住所或现代制冷方式的人而言演变成一种痛苦。	During heat waves, urban temperatures in India can be extreme even at night, making sleeping agonizing for those without proper shelter or modern cooling methods.
虽然Turkmenbashi在去年十二月死去，他的继任者Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov继续关押持不同政见者，遏制言论自由，并嘲弄民主，正如他在二月份舞弊的选举中所表现的那样。	And, although Turkmenbashi died in December, his successor, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, has continued to imprison dissidents, stifle freedom of expression, and scoff at democracy, as February’s rigged elections demonstrate.
其经济在过去四分之一个世纪中增长率一直处于1%的增长轨迹中，对一再实施的反常货币政策都没有什么反应。	Stuck in what has been essentially a 1% growth trajectory for the last quarter-century, its economy has failed to respond to repeated efforts at extraordinary monetary stimulus.
其信息真空让人想起了斯大林和毛泽东逝世前后的故作神秘，以及土耳其帝国将苏丹死讯保密数周、直到继任者尘埃落定方才公布的做法。	The information vacuum was reminiscent of the secrecy surrounding the deaths of Stalin and Mao, and the practice in the Ottoman empire of keeping the sultan’s death a secret for weeks until the succession was settled.
最近的危机暴露了一开始就存在的漏洞，也扩大了欧洲公民和欧盟制度之间、北欧和南欧之间以及欧洲各民族和精英阶层之间的裂缝。	The current crisis has exposed the original lacunae and widening cracks in the compact between Europe’s citizens and EU institutions, between Europe’s north and south, and between its peoples and its elites.
如果签署这样的协议，中国的现有提议 — — 在无核化的同时签署正式结束朝鲜战争的和平协议 — — 会成为可以实现的目标。	With such a deal in place, China’s existing proposal – denuclearization alongside a peace treaty to bring a formal end to the Korean War – would become achievable.
接着，在面临公众抵制时，他们又调低了计划涨幅，特别是市郊通勤人士目前所享有的极其优惠的月票价格。 市郊通勤人群是马哈拉施特拉邦首付孟买的重要选民群体。	Then, faced with public resistance, they moderated the planned hikes, particularly of the significantly discounted monthly pass currently available to suburban commuters – an important segment of the electorate in Mumbai, Maharashtra’s capital.
布宜诺斯艾利斯 — — 当今摆在拉美面前的重大问题是：秘鲁新当选总统奥兰塔·乌马拉是会仿效委内瑞拉总统乌戈·查韦斯及其激进盟友？	BUENOS AIRES – The big question in Latin America today is this: Will Peru’s newly elected president, Ollanta Humala, orient his country toward Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez and his radical allies?
面对最近数十年来的所有成就，真实的情况一直是：世界上20%的人口仍然仅靠每天不足1美元的收入生活，同时艾滋病和其他传染病在许多国家肆虐。	For all the successes of recent decades, the fact remains that 20% of the world's population still lives on less than $1 a day, while HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases are ravaging many societies.
他们不会充分考虑经济学所提供的所有观点，而是对某些特定方案过度自信 — — 通常是与他们自己的意识形态相符的那些。	Instead of communicating the full panoply of perspectives that their discipline offers, they display excessive confidence in particular remedies – often those that best accord with their own personal ideologies.
20世纪80年代，日本被广泛认为即将超越美国；如今，日本经历了二十年的停滞，再也没人把这种论断当真了。	In the 1980s, Japan was widely regarded as on the verge of overtaking the US; today, after more than two decades of Japanese stagnation, no one would take this scenario seriously.
多年后，一些雄心勃勃的年轻政客将考察特朗普的总统生涯，为发生在我们眼前的事件做出解释，他们会借用肯尼迪的标题，写一部《临阵脱逃 》 （ Profiles in Cowardice ） ， 集中描写共和党人的不健全人格。	Years from now, some young and ambitious politician will survey the Trump presidency and, in an effort to explain the events that are unfolding before us, pen a Kennedyesque Profiles in Cowardice focused on Republicans’ lack of personal integrity.
巴基斯坦的新总理，优素福·吉拉尼是一位经验丰富的政治家，更重要的是，他具有苏非派背景，因为该派提倡宽容的传统，这是一个很好的预兆。	Pakistan’s new prime minister, Yousaf Gilani, is a seasoned politician and, more importantly, has Sufi family roots, which is a good omen because of the Sufi tradition of tolerance.
《金融时报》专栏作家菲利普·史蒂芬斯（Philip Stephens）说 ： “ 当前全球秩序 — — 1945年建立起来并在冷战结束后扩大的基于规则的自由制度 — — 遭遇到前所未有的压力。	As Financial Times columnist Philip Stephens put it, “the present global order – the liberal rules-based system established in 1945 and expanded after the end of the Cold War – is under unprecedented strain.
的确，由于普通法的信用义务不能保护外界所有者，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）这样的监管机构才应运而生。	Indeed, regulatory agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) arose because common-law fiduciary duties failed to protect distant owners.
与此同时，我们的目的不应是结束本已岌岌可危的美俄关系，美俄关系的现状已经比第一次冷战时期的绝大多数时刻更糟。	At the same time, the objective should not be to end what little remains of the US-Russian relationship, which is already in worse shape than it was for much of the first Cold War.
半岛统一能让朝鲜半岛上的人们忙上二十年，而日本和美国在此期间将不得不注入大量的援助来重建并整合北朝鲜。	Unification would occupy the Korean people for the next two decades, with Japan and the US compelled to inject a huge amount of aid to rebuild and reintegrate the North.
很显然，减少二氧化碳排放量的政策不会降低一丁点的卡特里娜飓风对新奥尔良的破坏力，人们对那里发生这样的自然灾害早有预期。	Clearly, a policy of reducing CO2 emissions would have had zero consequence on Katrina’s devastating impact on New Orleans, where such a disaster was long expected.
根据我们的研究，自然气候解决方案有潜力让二氧化碳年排放量减少大约113亿吨 — — 相当于完全停止燃烧石油。	Natural climate solutions have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by an estimated 11.3 billion tons a year – equal to a complete halt in burning oil, according to our study.
埃伦·约翰逊·瑟利夫当选利比里亚总统标志着女性在非洲大陆所取得的进步，埃伦是受到推举管理非洲国家的首位女性。	Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf’s election as President of Liberia, the first women elected to run an African country, was symbolic of the progress of women across the continent.
性别平等也是一项道德要求，获得了2015年193个国家共同实施的联合国可持续发展目标（SDG）的承认。	Gender parity is also a moral imperative, recognized in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were adopted by 193 countries in 2015.
确实，人们可以说这样的象征性举动甚至会制造一种盲目乐观情绪，从而掩盖这一事实，也就是，由于教育和收入都比较低，印度的年轻妇女与其对应的男子相比继续占有少很多的资源。	Indeed, one could argue that such symbolic acts may even create a blind euphoria that obscures the fact that, as a result of less education and lower pay, young females in India continue to have far fewer resources than their male counterparts.
事实上，这些疾病中的最常见者 — — 单向抑郁症从症状来说是最不复杂的，但也是最致命的：据统计，20%的抑郁症患者会走上自杀之路。	Indeed, the most common of these illnesses, unipolar depression, is the least complex in terms of its symptoms, but also the most lethal: 20% of depressed patients are estimated to commit suicide.
尼泊尔充满活力的FM收音机频道 — — 曾经是权力下放给公众服务广播和教派广播的典范 — — 目前已被禁止广播业务。	Nepal’s vibrant FM radio stations – once models for decentralized public-service broadcasting and community radio – have been prohibited from broadcasting current affairs.
发自米兰 — — 意大利以及其他欧洲国家都在处理本国公/私债务方面面临着严重问题，因此让身为一个欧洲人的我来谈论美国不断加剧的债务问题似乎有点不太厚道。	MILAN – Italians and other Europeans have serious problems addressing their own national debts, public and private, so it may seem immodest for a European to discuss America’s growing and grave debt problem.
年均GDP增长率为3.2 % ； 而且和富裕的西方国家不同，不平等和失业率实际出现了下降，经济增长主要惠及五大收入分配层次中处在中间位置的三类民众。	Annual GDP growth averaged 3.2% over this period; and, unlike in the rich West, both inequality and unemployment have actually fallen, with growth mainly benefiting the middle three quintiles of the income distribution.
草率地将今天的危机归咎于气候变化能吸引眼球，但也让我们的注意力都集中在了成本最高而效率最低的应对方式上。	Jumping the gun and blaming climate change for today’s crises attracts attention, but it makes us focus on the costliest and least effective responses.
德国领导人已对此表示了不满，欧洲央行已经感到了不适，其买入举措已有所限制，并称政治领导人，而不是央行行长，才应该站出来拯救欧元。	German leaders have frowned on this, and the ECB has felt uncomfortable, limiting its purchases and saying that political leaders, not central bankers, should save the euro.
中国在经历了毛泽东大跃进和文化大革命的长期折腾之后于1970年代后期走到了崩溃的边缘，于是很快在邓小平“改革开放”战略下转向美国寻求外部支持。	On the brink of collapse in the late 1970s, following the cumulative convulsions of Mao’s Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, China was quick to turn to the US for external support for Deng Xiaoping’s strategy of “reform and opening up.”
朗菲尔德和帕加诺指出，在危机爆发以来的八年中，欧盟GDP只增长了2 % ， 而美国超过9 % ， 这一差异的原因是大西洋两岸金融结构的区别。	Langfield and Pagano point out that in the eight years since the crisis, the European Union’s GDP has grown by only 2%, compared to more than 9% in the US, and attribute this differential to transatlantic differences in financial structure.
然而只有少数观察人士敢于指出，这种快速逆转其实是由那些流动性过剩的全球资本主义核心地区孕育的套利交易操作推动下的信贷泡沫的结果。	Only a few observers dared to point out that this rapid reversal was the result of credit bubbles fueled by carry-trade operations hatched in overly liquid centers of global capitalism.
有利于抵押债务的政策本身就极受欢迎，获得了几乎所有主要政党政治家的一贯支持，在他们眼中实现住房所有权的最大化简直就是天经地义的事。	The policies that favor mortgage debt are extremely popular. Virtually all politicians of both major political parties have long supported them, taking the goal of maximizing homeownership as self-evident.
由此造成的不确定性可能引发更大的波动，特别是在债券市场，并可能阻碍经济复苏（比如通过推高长期按揭利率）或增加未来通胀风险。	The resulting uncertainty could trigger more volatility, especially in bond markets, potentially impeding economic recovery (for example, by pushing up long-term mortgage rates) or augmenting future inflation risk.
但谁也不相信希腊能在避免大规模社会动乱 — — 说不定还会濒临内战边缘 — — 的情况下作为欧元区成员国实现这一点。	It is inconceivable that Greece could manage that within the eurozone without widespread social unrest, if not conditions approaching those of civil war.
然而随着整合市场的发展，电力需求可以通过加纳，科特迪瓦和几内亚等电量富余国与布基纳法索和马里等其他以往依赖昂贵液体燃料的发电短缺国之间的调配来解决。	With an integrated market, however, power demand could be met as countries such as Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, and Guinea produce surpluses, while others such as Burkina Faso and Mali are in deficit and reliant on costly liquid fuels.
针对印第安奴隶的立法在查理二世的母亲、奥地利的玛利亚娜（Mariana of Austria）摄政期间得到进一步强化。	The legislation against Indian slavery was further strengthened during the regency of Mariana of Austria (1665-1675), the mother of Charles II.
但这种假设被证明是错误的，因为美国国会在去年12月份通过了一项大规模的税收法案，而该法案至少在短期内会为高收入家庭带来超出合理范围的收益。	That assumption would be wrong because, in December, the US Congress passed a sweeping tax bill that will, at least in the short term, disproportionately benefit higher-income households.
在与新教竞争这个问题上，过去两任教皇的一个重要特征是他们宣福的人的地理分布重心开始移出传统重镇欧洲。	With respect to competition with Protestants, the key feature of the last two popes is the shift in the geographical distribution of blessed persons away from the traditional dominance of Europe.
（值得一提的是，谢赫·瓦西勒此前与基地组织既无关系也不抱同情态度，他所代表的是一个完全不同的伊斯兰学派 ） 。	(Sheikh Wasil, it should be made known, has no links or known sympathies for Al Qaeda and he represents a very different Islamic school of thought.)
公众观点正在做出反应，支持议会进行“有意义的投票”决定梅与欧洲的最终协议是否真的比留在欧盟更好的人数显然占据多数。	And public opinion is responding, with clear majority support for a “meaningful vote” in Parliament to decide whether May’s final deal with Europe is genuinely better than remaining in the EU.
事实上，这些国家已经出现粮食和石油的相对价格的巨幅上扬、穷人的粮食危机和由商品价格上涨所引起的更高的通货膨胀。	Indeed, these countries are already experiencing large relative price increases for food and oil, a food emergency for the poor, and higher rates of inflation induced by commodity price shifts.
采取任务导向方针和实验自由 — — 认识到失败是难免甚至值得欢迎的学习过程特点 — — 的国家更加能够吸引顶级人才和追求彻底创新。	With a mission-oriented approach and the freedom to experiment – with failure understood to be an unavoidable, and even welcome, feature of the learning process – the state is better able to attract top talent and pursue radical innovation.
此外，在过度负债问题日益严重的中国，2011年佛山贷款与GDP之比只有85 % ， 远低于全国平均水平121 % 。	Moreover, in a country where excessive debt is a growing concern, Foshan’s loan-to-GDP ratio in 2011 was only 85% – far less than the national average of 121%.
更危险的是，内塔尼亚胡可能会实现他的下一个目标：阻止美国和伊朗缓和战略关系 及解决从也门到叙利亚的主要地区冲突。	More dangerous, Netanyahu could achieve his next goal: preventing a strategic détente between the US and Iran that would enable cooperation in resolving major regional conflicts, from Yemen to Syria.
美国和世界都在关注布什政府是否会按照伊拉克问题研究小组（Iraq Study Group）所建议的策略从伊拉克撤军。	America and the world are focused on whether the Bush administration will adopt the Iraq Study Group’s recommendations for an exit strategy from Iraq.
发自伦敦 — — 2007年，时任中国国家总理的温家宝指出“中国经济存在着巨大问题，依然是不稳定、不平衡、不协调、不可持续的结构性的问题 。 ”	LONDON – Back in 2007, China’s then-prime minister, Wen Jiabao, famously described his country’s economy as “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable.”
然而，因为美国人在对外投资上始终比外国人在美国的投资赚取高得多的回报，因此美国债务的增长速度也许只有其本应有的一半左右。	Yet, because Americans consistently earn a higher return on their investments abroad than foreigners earn on their US investments, US debt is rising at perhaps only half the rate that it might otherwise.
中共十八大三中全会强调市场竞争原则；但是，一位资深中国银行家在多年前的评论说 ： “ 如果你与裁判比赛，你很难去和他竞争 。 ”	The Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress gave primacy to the principle of market competition; but, as a senior Chinese banker commented in a related context some years back: “It’s quite hard to compete when you’re playing against the referee.”
尽管还没有人能够比得上半岛电视台的新闻和时事节目的欢迎程度，但是沙特拥有的中东广播中心已经成功引进了全天24小时电视台，挑战半岛电视台的领先地位。	Although no one has yet caught up to Al Jazeera’s news and current affairs popularity, the Saudi-owned Middle East Broadcasting Center has introduced a successful 24-hour station, Al Arrabiyeh, which is challenging Al Jazeera’s lead.
美国驻日部队也包括在其中。 该部队的主要任务将是应对北朝鲜核武器和弹道导弹威胁，以及国际恐怖主义和中国加强军事力量带来的新威胁。	This includes US forces in Japan, which will focus on responding to North Korean nuclear and ballistic-missile threats, as well as new threats posed by international terrorism and China’s military build-up.
大多数欧元区企业依赖银行融资，而虽然信贷状况得到了某种改善，贷款量依然波澜不惊（在南欧甚至持续下跌 ） 。	Most businesses in the eurozone rely on bank finance, and while credit conditions have improved somewhat, lending is flat (and continues to fall in southern Europe).
但当我们的资源远远不足以满足我们的人民的需要时 — — 而他们正在蒙受灾难带来的痛苦 — — 拒绝能够也愿意提供援助的国家伸出的援手既不礼貌，也不负责任。	But when our resources are nowhere near sufficient to meet the needs of our people – who are suffering in the wake of a devastating disaster – it is both churlish and irresponsible to reject aid from those who can and want to provide it.
这听上去简直像是出自蟒蛇喜剧团的台词，但却提出了一个重要问题：准公民在接受测试的时候究竟有没有限度？	While this might sound like an excerpt from a Monty Python sketch, it raises an important issue: should there be limits as to what prospective citizens are tested for?
事实上，美国未能在17个可持续发展目标中的任何一个排名达到绿色，经合组织中其他获此殊荣的国家仅有希腊、意大利、拉脱维亚、墨西哥、西班牙和土耳其等少数几个。	In fact, the US fails to achieve a single green ranking for any of the 17 SDGs, sharing this dubious honor with only Greece, Italy, Latvia, Mexico, Spain, and Turkey, among OECD nations.
现任波兰政府在掌权快一年的法律与正义党（PiS）的领导下，表现出类似的极权主义特征，通过践踏法律推行自己的目标。	The current Polish government, led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, which came to power just under a year ago, has displayed a similar authoritarian streak, flouting legal conventions to further its own ends.
据报那些转帐文件都被照常抹掉类似汇款目的地等关键细节，因此也更难对这类交易进行调查并难以搜集到违规证据。	The transfer documentation reportedly was regularly stripped of key details such as the destination of wire transfers, so that the transaction would be harder to investigate and less likely to provide evidence of malfeasance.
但欧尔班本人曾在索罗斯奖学金的资助下在牛津大学就读（我现在担任牛津大学的校长 ） ， 并曾经跟随伟大的自由思想家以赛亚·柏林学习。	Yet Orbán himself attended the University of Oxford (where I am Chancellor) on a Soros-funded scholarship, and studied there under the great liberal thinker Isaiah Berlin.
2009年初，全球股市崩盘达到谷底，密歇根大学消费情绪调查表明，对深度萧条的恐慌达到了自20世纪80年代初第二次石油危机以来的最高水平。	By early 2009, the plunge in stock markets around the world reached its nadir, and fear of a deep depression, according to the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey, was at its highest level since the second oil crisis in the early 1980’s.
虽然今天的破坏性政治都受到经济上的落差和挫折所推动，但身份才是矛的尖锐之处，正是它暴露和加深了那些既棘手又让人难以忍受的政治和社会分歧。	Though today’s disruptive politics are fueled by economic disappointment and frustration, identity is the tip of the spear. It has exposed and deepened political and social divisions that are as uncomfortable as they are intractable.
中东、北朝鲜、苏丹达佛、中非和东非以及高加索地区，在所有这些地方美国都无法再只靠一己的力量获得成功。	The Middle East, North Korea, Darfur, Central and East Africa, the Caucasus – in none of these places can the US still act successfully on its own.
仅仅想想当前的冲击是怎样提高全球的通货膨胀，降低全球穷人的收入，使美元走软，增加美国的贸易赤字，加重全球金融不稳定并增加了全球衰退的可能性这样一系列情况，就可以知道问题的严重性。	Just consider how the current bout has raised global inflation, lowered incomes of the global poor, weakened the dollar, deepened the US trade deficit, aggravated global financial instability, and increased the likelihood of a global recession.
这些很有可能引发许多股权和信贷市场的杠杆投资者将被迫出售非流动市场上的非流动资产的更广泛的风险，从而使资产价格大幅下降到它们的基本价值以下。	There is thus a broader risk that many leveraged investors in both equity and credit markets will be forced to sell illiquid assets in illiquid markets, leading to a cascading fall in asset prices to below their fundamental values.
比如，不但升级了其对日本对尖阁列岛（钓鱼岛）几十年控制权的挑战，还从去年控制黄岩岛开始于菲律宾针锋相对。	For example, China has not only escalated its challenge to Japan’s decades-old control of the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands, but is also facing off against the Philippines since taking effective control of Scarborough Shoal last year.
朝鲜领导人早就因为销售导弹，毒品和伪钞而臭名昭著，许多人因此担心它会将这些核物质卖给其他国家或恐怖组织。	Its leaders have a reputation for selling dangerous items such as missiles, narcotics, and counterfeit currency, and many worry that they might transfer nuclear materials to other countries or to terrorist groups.
与此同时，中国净对外资产只有GDP的14.7 % ， 日本为67.5 % ， 德国为48.3 % （ 美国为-41 % ） 。	Meanwhile, China’s net foreign assets amounted to only 14.7% of GDP, compared to 67.5% for Japan and 48.3% for Germany (negative 41% of GDP for the US).
因为没有留下任何机构来保障这些国家的和平政治过渡，暴力团体在普通民众面前占据上风，导致对权力的野蛮争夺随之而来。	With no institutions left to ensure a peaceful political transition in these countries, violent groups had an advantage over ordinary citizens, and a crude fight for power ensued.
英国，西班牙以及爱尔兰都经历着同样的事情，伴随着住房泡沫的缩小和过度的消费者债务减少零售销售，从而导致衰退的发生。	The UK, Spain, and Ireland are experiencing similar developments, with housing bubbles deflating and excessive consumer debt undercutting retail sales, thus leading to recession.
当英国与欧洲“离婚”的细节最终公布时，公司和家庭将有所反应，特别是如果英国与欧盟的贸易、经济和金融联系发生重大变化的话。	When the details of Britain’s divorce from the EU are eventually announced, companies and households will respond, particularly if the country’s trading, economic, and financial linkages with the EU change considerably.
欧盟需要在整个地区采取统揽全局的方法，重点关注为使每个国家都朝获得成员国资格的方向努力而在接下来需要采取的步骤。	The EU needs a comprehensive regional approach, focusing on the remaining steps that would lead each country towards membership.
在现实中，其他国家的货币波动可能给它们的通胀造成重大影响，但美元波动很少对美国物价造成有意义的或持久的影响。	In reality, while currency movements can have a significant impact on inflation in other countries, dollar movements have rarely had a meaningful or durable impact on prices in the US.
尽管贸易关系时常需要进行一些调整，但过去这种改变都会以有序及合作的方式来进行 — — 而非借助持续与不断增加的关税施压。	While some tweaks to trade relations are needed, in the past such changes would have been pursued in an orderly and cooperative fashion – not under constant and growing tariff pressure.
有一些科学家和许多科幻作家则大胆想象，说可以发射核弹摧毁那些飞向地球的小行星、 彗 星、流星或外星飞船。	A few scientists, and many science-fiction writers, have also speculated about using nuclear weapons to destroy or damage an asteroid, comet, meteor, or alien spacecraft heading toward the earth.
我们将会亲眼目睹在经济实力、地缘相对隔离和强大制度武装下的美国面对普京恶性实例的影响是否能拥有更好的保护。	We shall see whether the United States – with its economic strength, relative geographical isolation, and strong institutions – is better protected than Turkey against the influence of Putin’s malign example.
法国、英国、澳大利亚、瑞典，挪威和瑞士都对这一紧急议程表示了支持，并一致认为不能再纵容这种国际犯罪行为逍遥法外。	France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland all support this urgent agenda, and agree that impunity for this type of global crime can no longer be tolerated.
当时的独裁执政者阿纳斯塔西奥·索莫扎（Anastasio Somoza）把大量用于救助地震生还者的国际救援资金揣进了自己及其亲信的腰包。	Nicaragua’s dictator, Anastasio Somoza, diverted much of the international assistance meant for the survivors into his own pockets and those of his cronies.
首先，他应该设计可行而令人满意的全面经济政策计划组合 — — 在这方面，做出重大不同的空间是有限的。	First, he would devise a comprehensive set of economic-policy initiatives that are both feasible and desirable – and, again, the scope for major differences here is limited.
这些观点经常引用弗里德曼的话。 他在1998年警告说，欧洲实行欧元的承诺将会在第一场严重的经济衰退中受到考验。	Such arguments often invoke Milton Friedman, who warned in 1998 that Europe’s commitment to the euro would be tested by the first serious economic downturn.
此外，温室气体排放刺激着气候变化，政府间气候变化委员会（Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ）警告说，这会危及所有国家，而中国更是其中的高危国家。	Moreover, greenhouse-gas emissions are contributing to climate change, the effects of which, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns, could prove devastating for all countries, with China highly vulnerable.
下周，哥本哈根全球绿色增长论坛（Global Green Growth Forum）将让我们根深度地检视这一问题。	Next week, the Global Green Growth Forum in Copenhagen will allow for a deeper look at this issue.
纽约联储在银行监督方面也扮演着特别重要的角色 — — 大部分“太大而不能倒”的银行位于其管辖区中（大部分全球银行也在这片地区设有分支 ） 。	The New York Fed also has a particularly important role in bank supervision – most of America’s “too big to fail” banks are located in its jurisdiction (and most global banks have a presence there).
它们分别效忠两家互相竞争的政府、基地组织和伊斯兰国，后者将利比亚视为其日益萎缩的哈里发的一个省份、逃离叙利亚和伊拉克的伊斯兰国成员的重要避难地。	Their allegiance is divided among the two competing governments, al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State (ISIS), which views the country as a province of its dwindling caliphate and an important refuge for members escaping the war in Syria and Iraq.
我们之所以感兴趣不是为了揭发他，而是为了对一个血腥、蛊惑民心和专制的乌托邦以及人的弱点和脆弱性有更深的理解。	We should be interested not for prosecutorial purposes, but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloody, demagogical, and tyrannical Utopia – and of human weakness and vulnerability.
类似地，尽管瑞典总体无歧视记录十分出色，但移民仍难以融入瑞典社会，相对土生土长的瑞典人仍要面临劳动力市场劣势。	Similarly, despite Sweden’s excellent record on non-discrimination in general, immigrants find it difficult to integrate into Swedish society and face disadvantages in the labor market relative to native Swedes.
埃及显然是这一战略的最重要部分，而埃及政治动荡不但导致土耳其政治模式受到质疑，也威胁到了其经济利益安全。	Egypt was clearly the most important part of this strategy, and its political instability has raised questions not only about Turkey’s political model, but also about the security of its economic interests.
斯托克霍姆在2015年秋至2016年春期间接收了8,000名寻求庇护者，市长万加尔德（Karin Wanngård）正在开发一种新型成人学校。	In Stockholm, which took in 8,000 asylum-seekers between fall 2015 and spring 2016, Mayor Karin Wanngård is developing a new type of school for adults.
此外，欧洲刑警组织以及欧洲司法组织等机构也同样要更多地接受议会的监督，而且预算制定的程序将会更加简洁，同时也更加民主。	Moreover, agencies such as Europol and Eurojust will be similarly subject to greater parliamentary scrutiny, and the budgetary procedure will be simpler and more democratic.
美联储一开始暗示其意图逐渐减少QE时，一些新兴经济体的决策者怨声载道，但发达经济体官员指出他们经常这样大声抱怨。	When the Fed initially hinted at its intention to taper QE, policymakers in some emerging economies cried foul, but were dismissed by advanced-economy officials as chronic complainers.
拟议中的美印协议的批评者们错误的地方是，他们说这一双重标准用到印度身上就是错误的，因为它为类似朝鲜和伊朗等国发展核武器铺平了道路。	Where the critics of the proposed US-India accord are wrong is in charging that such a double standard is wrong when it comes to India because it opens the way for countries such as North Korea and Iran to develop nuclear weapons.
但是，随着埃尔多安及其温和派伊斯兰正义和发展党巩固了手中的权力和对国家的掌控力，他们对异见人士的容忍度有所下降。	Yet, as Erdoğan and his moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party have consolidated their power and their control of the country, their tolerance for dissent has declined.
因此，德拉吉在这方面的计划不能仅仅理解为对行动的呼吁，它也是 — — 甚至在更大程度上是 — — 对深思欧元区未来决策的呼吁。	Draghi’s initiative on this front should thus be interpreted not only as a call for action, but also – and perhaps even more so – as a call for reflection on the future approach to eurozone policymaking.
大约60,000名寻求注册的难民被投入条件很不人道的拘留中心，没有注册的移民则露宿街头，成为新法西斯金色黎明党流氓的袭击对象。	Some 60,000 refugees who sought to register have been put into detention facilities where conditions are inhumane. Migrants who do not register and live on the street are attacked by the hooligans of the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party.
如果要实现货币统治地位的话，中国需要一些超越经济和军事力量之外的力量；而需要建立一个更广泛也更具可信度的公共和政治体制。	To achieve currency dominance, China needs more than economic and military might; it requires a broader and more credible set of public and political institutions.
因为生活的核心是社会交往，把人们从他们借以生存发展的网络中割裂出来是一种有力的惩罚 — — 还可以通过去中心化的方式来进行。	Because life is social to the core, disconnecting people from the networks we all use to survive and thrive can be a powerful punishment – and can be meted out in a decentralized way.
简单的一刀切方案 — — 如欧盟委员会和欧洲央行提出的方案 — — 无异于给目前处于焖燃状态的欧洲银行之火浇上汽油。	A single, one-size-fits-all solution, such as what the EU Commission and the ECB are pursuing, amounts to an attempt to fight Europe’s smoldering bank fires with gasoline.
利率自由化并没有采取直接方式 — — 提高银行利率上限 — — 而是通过允许影子银行兴盛的方式实现。	Instead of taking a direct approach – lifting the interest-rate cap imposed on banks – liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish.
报告指出，通过降低成本、增进效率，金融技术已经开始动员绿色金融，让穷人能够通过创新性支付系统获得清洁能源，也便利了富人和穷人的绿色储蓄。	As the report points out, by reducing costs and boosting efficiency, fintech is already mobilizing green finance, enabling poorer people to access clean energy through innovative payment systems and facilitating green savings for rich and poor alike.
他同样令人信服地指出，信息和通讯技术（ICT）等当今的创新无法像电力和汽车等过去的创新那样带来巨大的经济回报。	He has argued – also persuasively – that today’s innovations in areas like information and communications technology (ICT) cannot be expected to have as big an economic payoff as those of the past, such as electricity and the automobile.
即使它真的开始运作，金砖国家也缺乏更给予各种开发银行（特别是世界银行）合法性和分量的东西：主要由具备世界顶尖水平的敬业专家工作人员。	Even if it does begin to function, the BRICS lack what gives development banks, and the World Bank in particular, legitimacy and weight: a staff composed mostly of dedicated experts who are among the world’s best.
欧盟“更广大的欧洲”的愿景依赖于软实力、经济一体化和长期制度建设，而普京的“更广大的俄罗斯”政策依赖于威吓和暴力。	While the EU’s vision of “wider Europe” relies on soft power, economic integration, and long-term institution building, Putin’s “wider Russia” policy depends on intimidation and violence.
有一个没人曾明确谈到过的等价交换行为必须得到关注：那就是在上述各种议题之间的讨价还价，而不是仅仅是一个议题之内的利益交换。	There is a quid pro quo that no one explicitly talks about but which must be addressed: trade-offs between these negotiations, not just within them.
如果政策制定者预计通胀率将达到2％但经济增长率将在两年内低于2 ％ ， 那么他们就要拿捏提升利率及其对经济的抑制作用。	If policymakers expected inflation to reach 2%, but economic growth to be less than 2%, in two years, then they would need to balance how much economic dampening a rate rise would bring about.
发自巴黎 — — 如果要在全世界范围内找一个既能赋予所有国家以投票权，又奉行少数服从多数原则的议事机构，那就非联合国大会莫属了。	PARIS – The United Nations’ General Assembly is the world’s only body in which all countries vote, with majority rule prevailing.
但智利政府却受制于剩余资金不足，因为政府将两年前增税带来的可观资金投资于（甚至为高收入学生）提供免费大学教育等考虑不周的政策。	But the Chilean government has little money left, having committed the revenues from a sizeable tax increase two years ago to the ill-conceived policy of free university education, even for high-income students.
事实上，根据德国财政部的说法，德国的盈余“不是担心的原因，不管对德国，对欧元区还是对全球经济来说都是如此 。 ”	Indeed, according to the German finance ministry, the surplus is “no cause for concern, neither for Germany, nor for the eurozone, or the global economy.”
奥巴马双管齐下，既宣告这一权力，也寻求国会授权，这使他跻身于少数积极寻求约束自身权力的领导人的行列。	By simultaneously claiming that authority and seeking Congressional authorization to use it, Obama enters a small class of leaders who actively seek to constrain their own power.
我怀疑我们会继续永远把这一世界第一运动称为“soccer ” （ 其他国家称为“football ” ， 美国“football”是橄榄球 ） 。	I suspect that we will always call the world’s game “soccer.”
但至少在美国，特朗普的意识形态 — — 与传统共和党保守主义几乎没有关系 — — 所勾勒的分歧并非是多数人与极少数人，而是民族主义者与全球主义者。	But in the US at least, Trump’s ideology – which has little to do with traditional Republican conservatism – frames the axis of division not as the many versus the few, but as nationalists versus globalists.
我的同事泰勒（Richard Thaler）和桑斯坦（Cass Sunstein，现在奥巴马政府中就职）写过一本畅销书《助推 》 （ Nudge ） ， 在书中他们指出，有一种办法可以减轻我们对家长式作风的不安。	My colleague, Richard Thaler, along with Cass Sunstein, who currently serves in the Obama administration, wrote a best-selling book, Nudge, in which they suggest a way to reduce our uneasiness with paternalism.
世贸双塔的建造者无论来自何处，都无一例外地希望成为美国人，新世界的公民。 他们建造的大厦象征着自由的精神。	The builders of the twin towers, whatever their native tongues, wanted to be Americans, citizens of the New World, the towers they built symbolizing the stature of freedom.
据经合组织的数据，从2000年到2013年，在196个数据源国家中，有130个肥胖率每年至少增加0.5%	According to the OECD, from 2000 to 2013, the prevalence of obesity increased by at least 0.5% per year in 130 of the 196 countries for which data were collected.
在全球无政府状态风险越来越突出的情况下，法国和英国勇敢但冒险的积极态度不应被视为美���贡献的替代物。	In the face of growing risks of global anarchy, the courageous but risky activism of France and Britain should not be seen as a substitute for an engaged US.
中国的价格调查并不实行随机地点采样（这是准确性的要求 ） ， 而是把数据收集地点限制在几个城市区域。	Rather than permit price surveys in a random sample of locations (required for accuracy), China restricted data collection to a few urban areas.
所以，查韦斯所谓“玻利瓦尔革命”的推广和强化不符合巴西的利益。 尽管卢拉总统麾下的某些官员似乎是查韦斯及其政府的崇拜者。	So the spread and strengthening of Chávez’s so-called Bolivarian Revolution was not in Brazil’s interests, even though some of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s officials appear to be fans of Chávez and his administration.
想像一副简单的情景：国家禁止公司和所有者出于经济原因进行裁员，那么面对禁止解雇的规定，股东们有理由更小心谨慎：如果扩张不能盈利，他们就不能削减劳动力成本。	Consider a simple scenario: a nation bars firms and owners from laying off employees for economic reasons. Faced with a no-fire rule, shareholders have reason to be very cautious: if expansion is not profitable, they cannot reduce labor costs.
在随后的两年内，美国民用住房建筑投资直线上升，从6240亿美元飙升到7980亿。 失业率也从5.7%降到4.6 % ， 经济实际年增长率是3.1 % 。	Over the next two years, annual US spending on residential construction roared upward, from $624 billion to $798 billion, the US unemployment rate dropped from 5.7% to 4.6%, and the economy grew at a 3.1% real annual rate.
让情况更加复杂的是朴槿惠需要找到可行的应对之道来对付常常毫无魅力可言的朝鲜领导人金正恩的外交魅力攻势。	Complicating matters further is the need for Park to devise a viable response to a new diplomatic charm offensive by North Korea’s usually charmless leader, Kim Jong-un.
在默克尔方面，她与特朗普紧张和痛苦的会面几乎就跟她与特朗普心目中的英雄榜样 — — 俄罗斯总统普京 — — 的冷淡交锋一样传奇。	As for Merkel, her taut and anguished meetings with Trump are almost as legendary as her frosty encounters with Trump’s apparent hero, Russian President Vladimir Putin.
像今年现任财政部长史蒂文·姆努钦（Steven Mnuchin）在达沃斯论坛上所辩解的那样，贝克可能会抱怨说对他言论的解读是断章取义。	Like current Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at Davos this year, Baker could complain that his comments were taken out of context.
新兴市场现今所面临的首要政策困境是：一方面，持续的经济增长需要一种具有竞争力（即“估值偏低 ” ） 的货币。	The paramount policy dilemma that emerging markets face nowadays is this: on the one hand, sustained economic growth requires a competitive (read “undervalued”) currency.
相反，前国务卿、民主党候选人希拉里·克林顿和共和党阵营中的领先者唐纳德·特朗普都反对社会安全与医疗保险改革。	By contrast, former Secretary of State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and a leading Republican contender, Donald Trump, have opposed reform of Social Security and Medicare.
1986年曾修正过一次、1997又修正过一次 — — 巴林银行倒闭后，英格兰银行被剥夺了银行监督责任。	There were major overhauls in 1986, and again in 1997, when the Bank of England lost its banking supervision responsibilities as a delayed response to the collapse of Barings.
目前，苹果和谷歌在智能手机操作系统方面呈双头垄断态势，但它们依然激烈竞争以改善自身功能并推出新产品。	Currently, Apple and Google hold a duopoly on smartphone operating systems, yet they compete vigorously to improve their features and roll out new products.
在我们的文章《自由民主的政治经济学 》 （ The Political Economy of Liberal Democracy）中，沙伦·穆坎德（Sharun Mukand）对自由民主的基础进行了讨论，与芒克不谋而合。	In our paper “The Political Economy of Liberal Democracy,” Sharun Mukand and I discuss the underpinnings of liberal democracy in terms similar to those Mounk uses.
在我的祖国巴拉圭，我与我国最大的社会机构之一巴拉圭基金会（Fundación Paraguaya）合作为成千上万最贫穷巴拉圭公民提供微金融、教育和培训。	In my home country, Paraguay, I work with one of the country’s largest social enterprises, Fundación Paraguaya, to provide microfinance, education, and training to thousands of our poorest citizens.
朝鲜的核弹据估测有4千吨TNT当量，无论在哪方面都不能与美国在64年前投下的约15-21千吨TNT当量的核弹相提并论。	The North Korean bomb, estimated at four kilotons, does not come anywhere near the magnitude of the atomic bombs of 15-21 kilotons that America dropped on Japan 64 years ago.
叙利亚和伊拉克周边国家面临着逃离上述两国暴力的最大量的难民涌入，UNHCR 呼吁协助安置有限数量的最需要群体。	The countries neighboring Syria and Iraq are facing the largest inflows of refugees fleeing the violence there, and the UNHCR has appealed for assistance in resettling a limited number of the neediest.
其他人（特别是金融资产管理者）则越来越认为经济学家知之甚少，而且他们所知晓的那点东西对自己这样的商人毫无用处。	Others – especially managers of financial assets – are becoming increasingly convinced that economists don’t know very much, and that what they do know is of no use to traders like themselves.
交通银行在吸纳汇丰的投资后不久即在香港股票市场上市，因此和那些还在等待民营化的银行相比，它能给市场提供更多资讯。	The Bank of Communications listed on the Hong Kong stock market shortly after the HSBC investment, so it has been able to provide the market with more information than have the banks that are still awaiting privatization.
随后，希腊、爱尔兰和葡萄牙丧失了融资能力，向国际货币基金组织（IMF）和欧盟寻求“保释 ” （ bailout ） 。	And then Greece, Ireland, and Portugal lost access to credit markets, requiring bailout packages from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.
但如果其政府向贸易伙伴国政府支付等于超额出口价值的罚款，它也可以出口超过限额的量，罚款可以来自出口商，也可以用外汇储备。	But it could also exceed its export quota if its government paid the partner government a fine equal to the value of the excess exports, either collecting the necessary sum from its export producers or using its currency reserves.
保护世界湿地 — — 它们也提供了极具价值的服务，包括沿岸地区保护和阻止河谷爆发洪水等 — — 也很明智，每一美元投入可以获得十倍回报。	Conserving the world's wetlands – which also provide valuable services, including protection of coastal areas and river valleys from flooding – is also sensible, providing a tenfold return on each dollar spent.
比如，教育进步 — — 特别是女孩教育 — — 与儿童存活率和营养、产妇健康以及收入提高状况改善密切相关。	For example, progress in education – especially girls’ education – is closely associated with improvements in child survival and nutrition, and maternal health, as well as higher wages.
如今，埃及不仅面临着国内政治动荡，还面临着货币危机的风险 — — 这主要是拜国际储备不断消耗所赐，自去年10月以来，每个月大概都要减少20亿美元。	Today, Egypt not only remains vulnerable to unstable domestic politics; owing to the depletion of its international reserves – at a rate of roughly $2 billion a month since last October – the country now also faces the threat of a currency crisis.
与此同时，我们的采集祖先吃的是碳水化合物（葡萄糖聚合物 ） ， 它们也被送到肝脏，通过糖分分解路径分解为能量。	Meanwhile, our gatherer ancestors ate carbohydrates (polymers of glucose), which was also transported to the liver, via the glycolytic pathway, and broken down for energy.
在短短十年的时间里，欧元对全球经济环境起到了革命性的作用，它的地位上升到了世界第二大货币，是可以和美元媲美的国际贸易和金融的一种媒介。	In ten short years, the euro revolutionized the global economic environment, rising to the status of the world’s second currency and rivaling the dollar as a medium for international trade and finance.
最重要的是，我们面临着全新的威胁，它们与以往的威胁有所不同，不再局限于某个国家的范围之内，而是影响遍及全球。	On top of all this, we face a new generation of threats, unlike any in history, which spill across borders and have global reach.
安哥拉、埃塞俄比亚、加纳和尼日利亚也有着令人瞩目的真实增长，但名义GDP是由极大的贸易条件效应和实际升值提振的。	Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria also had very significant real growth, but nominal GDP was boosted by very large terms-of-trade effects and real appreciation.
检测技术必须有能力分析所有形式的药品 — — 不管是粉末、药丸、胶囊还是药浆 — — 并能检测几种不同的质量级别，而不仅仅只分伪劣品和正品两类。	Detection technology must be capable of analyzing all forms of a drug – whether powder, pill, capsule, or syrup – and of detecting several different grades of quality, not just the junk.
逊尼和什叶派分裂可以追溯到632年，当时先知穆罕默德死前未及明确快速扩张的伊斯兰社会应如何挑选继任者。	The Sunni-Shia schism goes back to the year 632, when the Prophet Muhammad died without indicating how the fast-growing Islamic community should pick his successor.
两场冲突都过多地消耗了这个国家的资源 — — 其中当然有军事和经济资源，还包括了政策制定者和外交人员的时间和精力。	The two conflicts have absorbed a disproportionate share of the country’s resources – military and economic to be sure, but also the time and attention of policymakers and diplomats.
纽约—拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）正确地指出 ， “ 长期停滞”一词从二战临近结束时开始流行。	NEW YORK – As Larry Summers rightly points out, the term “secular stagnation” became popular as World War II was drawing to a close.
平均持股的时间日益下降与所谓的“无控股企业”现象似乎有联系，因而股东没有什么动力迫使管理层遵守纪律。	But Haldane’s main concern is with the stability of markets, particularly the threats posed by high-frequency trading (HFT).
不管是拥有最新款智能手机，还是“雇用”机器人清扫机，获得创新的能力是富国和穷国之间最醒目的差异之一。	Whether it is owning the latest smartphone or “employing” robot cleaners, the ability to access innovation is one of the most visible differences between rich and poor countries.
同理，托克维尔认为像古人一般追求美德或者宗教信仰或许有时可以升华灵魂，但是如果二者在公共生活中得以正是规定，那么他们就会与民主理想发生冲突。	Similarly, while Tocqueville thought that pursuing virtue as the ancients did, or having a religious faith, could sometimes elevate the soul, both conflict with the democratic ideal if they become officially prescribed in public life.
后苏联时代的经济出现崩溃，治安极度恶化，预期寿命大幅下降；而俄国在全球事务中的话语也失去了往日的权威。	The post-Soviet economy crumbled, crime skyrocketed, and life expectancy declined. Russia’s voice in global affairs lost authority.
在科学杂志6月30日刊登的一篇文章上，他们发表观点称，他们的研究数据证实在收入和幸福之间几乎没有什么关联。	In an article published in Science on June 30, they report that their data confirm that there is little correlation between income and happiness.
另一项进展可能随之而来，其基础是格雷西·马歇尔（Graça Machel）十年前成功说服联合国安理会实施了冲突地区针对儿童暴力事件报告制度。	Another advance could follow, based on Graça Machel’s victory a decade ago in convincing the UN Security Council to implement a system for reporting violence against children in conflict zones.
特别是，石油天然气行业占阿尔及利亚出口收入的97 % ， 2014年6月以来的油价暴跌让阿尔及利亚经济模式难以为继。	In particular, with the oil and gas industry accounting for fully 97% of Algeria’s export income, the sharp decline in oil prices since June 2014 has underscored the unsustainability of the country’s economic model.
在今天的经济中，许多部门 — — 电信、有线电视、从社交媒体到互联网搜索的数字行业、医疗保险、制药、农企集团，等等 — — 都无法用竞争角度理解。	In today’s economy, many sectors – telecoms, cable TV, digital branches from social media to Internet search, health insurance, pharmaceuticals, agro-business, and many more – cannot be understood through the lens of competition.
圣地亚哥—国际货币基金组织（IMF）刚刚连续第五年降低了拉丁美洲经济增长预测，该地区各国正在竭力寻找重振投资和刺激生产率的办法。	SANTIAGO – With the International Monetary Fund having just cut its forecasts for economic growth in Latin America for the fifth year in a row, the region’s countries are casting about for ways to reignite investment and boost productivity.
事实上，如果双亲或兄弟姐妹中有人罹患阿尔茨海默症，你的患病风险也将翻番，这很有可能是因为ApoE基因所赐。	Indeed, the risk of Alzheimer’s doubles if a parent or sibling has it, probably due in large part to the presence of the ApoE gene.
在菜单不断推陈出新，食品成分不断变化组合的情况下，对所有的餐厅食品实施强制性的标准化标示既不现实，又不具成本效益。	Mandated standardized labeling of all restaurant meals would be neither practical nor cost-efficient, given the ever-changing menus and diverse mixtures of ingredients of meals served in restaurants.
如果在另一方面它就更多的经济甚至可能的军事惩罚达成一致，那么，联合国的信誉度将会取决于这些行动是否会让伊朗就范。	If, on the other hand, it works out a consensus on more economic and possibly even military punishment, the UN’s credibility would depend on whether these moves produce Iranian compliance.
信用宽松将很快通过定向长期再融资操作开始（向欧元区银行提供补贴流动性，以换取流向私人部门的贷款的加速增长 ） 。	Credit easing will start soon with targeted long-term refinancing operations (which provide subsidized liquidity to eurozone banks in exchange for faster growth in lending to the private sector).
而这就意味着持有这些资产的金融机构不能对潜在交易对手的资产变现能力和偿付能力抱有信心—甚至对自身的资本价值也是如此。	And that means that the financial institutions that own them cannot have confidence in the liquidity or solvency of potential counterparties – or even in the value of their own capital.
太宽泛的定义会破坏一国的主权，太狭窄的定义 — — 比如主宰当今世界之物 — — 又会让暴力和动荡蔓延。	Just as too broad a definition could undermine a country’s sovereignty, too narrow a definition – like that which seems to predominate today – allows violence and instability to proliferate.
但在同一篇讲话中，特朗普也背叛了他授予以色列的更高的地位 ： “ 以色列是一个主权国家，他和其他任何主权国家一样，有权选择自己的首都 。 ”	But, in that same speech, Trump betrayed the superiority he ascribes to Israel: “Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital.”
中国第三产业（服务业）占GDP之比从2007年的43%增加到2016年的52 % ， 而第二产业（制造业和建筑业）的比重同期从47%下降到40 % 。	China’s tertiary sector (services) has gone from 43% of GDP in 2007 to 52% in 2016, whereas the share of the secondary sector (manufacturing and construction) has fallen from 47% to 40% over the same period.
基于对他经手的对五名杀人狂的详细调查，穆伦认为这些杀手难以协调自视甚高和无法胜任工作或关系之间的矛盾。	Based on a detailed investigation of five mass murderers whom he personally examined, Mullen concluded that such killers struggle to reconcile their own grandiose ideas of themselves with an inability to succeed at work or in relationships.
通过与万事达卡的联合包容增长研究，以及向哈佛大学国际发展中心的匿名数据捐赠，我们开始探索这一谜题并取得了一些洞见。	Thanks to a research collaboration on inclusive growth with MasterCard and an anonymized donation of data to the Center for International Development at Harvard University, we are starting to shed some light on this mystery.
发自纽约 — — 2015年，联合国各成员国济济一堂，共同承诺要实现17项涵盖各个经济和社会发展方面、具备全面性和通行性的可持续发展目标。	NEW YORK – In 2015, United Nations member states came together and committed to achieving a comprehensive and universal set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) spanning all dimensions of economic and social development.
这种变化将有助于消除持少数族裔语言者的事实性隔离状态，从而整合乌克兰社会 — — 这对实现强大且充满活力的民主至关重要。	This change will help to eliminate de facto segregation of minority-language speakers, thereby unifying Ukrainian society – critical to a strong and vibrant democracy.
或者，如精神病医生兹维·瑞斯（Zvi Rex）的名言所说 ， “ 由于奥斯维辛，德国人永远不会原谅犹太人 。 ”	Or, as the psychiatrist Zvi Rex famously quipped, “Germans will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz.”
类似地，政府长期未能偿还的债务也将成为子孙后代的负担：我可以从政府的铺张浪费中获得好处，这得由我的子孙后代买单。	Similarly, a debt left unpaid too long by a government is a burden on future generations: I may enjoy the benefits of government extravagance, but my children will have to foot the bill.
盖达尔在去年离世，而他那未被关注的警告却正在成为事实，这再度证实了在他的国家内永远没有人能成为一个成功的预言家。	Gaidar died last year, his unheeded warnings having come true, proving once again that no man is ever a successful prophet in his own country.
二十年前，成立一个亚洲联盟的主要障碍之一是日本这个亚洲最先进同时也是最成功，但是对亚洲并没有认同感的��家。	Twenty years ago, one of the main obstacles to creating an Asian Union was Japan – Asia’s most advanced and successful country, but one that did not feel Asian.
纽约—如今，美国总统特朗普几乎每一天都会升级他针对别国和它们的国家首脑、穷人和弱势群体，以及移民家庭的政策和人身攻击。	NEW YORK – Seemingly every day now, US President Donald Trump escalates his policy and personal attacks against other countries and their heads of state, the poor and the weak, and migrant families.
但尽管助推上述选择的不满情绪确实存在 — — 很多人被全球化进程远远抛在了后面 — — 但这种应对方法很可能比问题本身造成更大的危害。	But, while the grievances fueling these choices are real – many have been left behind by globalization – the treatment is likely to cause more harm than the disease.
而尽管新政府应该坚持有条件地提高德国欧盟预算贡献，以防止浪费性支出，但其作出更加明确的欧盟承诺应该值得欢迎。	And although the new government should attach conditions to Germany’s larger EU budget contribution, in order to prevent wasteful spending, its clear commitment to the EU should be welcomed.
会议讨论的主题是民粹主义，而这位野心家名叫马克·琼根，他是一位拥有哲学博士学位的极右翼德意志民主党（AfD）政治家。	The conference was about populism, and the ideologue was named Marc Jongen, a politician from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party with a doctorate in philosophy.
我们已经进入了一个危险的时期，人口数量庞大且在不断增长，经济增长十分迅速，因而对地球气候、生物多样性和清洁水供给造成了灾难性影响。	We have entered a dangerous period in which a huge and growing population, combined with rapid economic growth, now threatens to have a catastrophic impact on the earth’s climate, biodiversity, and fresh-water supplies.
与此同时，贝南克接任以后还要处理两个经济问题，这两个问题在历史上前所未有，而且十分不同寻常，因为它们在20世纪30年代的大萧条之前根本没有出现过。	At the same time, Bernanke is inheriting a pair of economic vulnerabilities that are unusual by historical standards, and that did not precede the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
在美国，最新经济数据 — — 包括疲软的劳动力市场数据 — — 确认了增长不振的现状，2012年下半年产出不可能大大超过1—6月份的1.6%的年增长率。	In the United States, the latest economic data – including a weak labor market – confirm that growth is anemic, with output in the second half of 2012 unlikely to be significantly stronger than the 1.6% annual gain recorded in January-June.
人们越来越刻意地强调爱国和主权，随处可见不信任“他人”的表述 — — 甚至远在北冰洋，加拿大和俄罗斯也正在进行一位专家所称的“简化版冷战 。 ”	Patriotism and sovereignty are now stressed ever more insistently, while expressions of distrust of “others” have appeared everywhere – even in the Arctic Ocean, where Canada and Russia are engaged in what one expert has called “Cold War lite.”
这将我带回了以下观点：美国必须把自己家收拾整齐 — — 经济上、物质上、社会上和政治上 — — 才能有必要的资源去促进世界的秩序。	This brings me back to the argument that the US must put its house in order – economically, physically, socially, and politically – if it is to have the resources needed to promote order in the world.
正如笔者在近期的国会证词中指出的一样，教育程度低导致工作前景差，家庭收入低，反过来又导致教育程度低 — — 如果再加上犯罪入狱的话，要打破这种循环就更难了。	As I pointed out in recent Congressional testimony, poor education leads to poor job prospects, poor families, and back to poor education – if not with a detour through incarceration, which makes it even harder to break the cycle.
因此，如今我们可能仍处于IMF所谓的“新平庸 ” （ new mediocre ） 、 拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）所谓的“长期停滞”和中国人所谓的“新常态”中。	Thus, for the time being, we are likely to remain in what the IMF calls the “new mediocre,” Larry Summers calls “secular stagnation,” and the Chinese call the “new normal.”
尽管年真实人均GDP增长了72 % ， 从29,999美元增加到50,000美元（用2009年物价衡量 ） ， 这一增幅几乎全部都流向了美国收入分配顶层人群。	While annual real GDP per capita has grown 72%, from $29,000 to $50,000 (in 2009 prices), almost all of this growth has gone to those who now occupy the highest tier of the US income distribution.
要解决上述问题，意大利新一代领导人必须通过把劳动力对生产率增长的贡献和资本以及总要素生产力中分离开来。	Italy’s new leaders must address this situation by decoupling labor’s contribution to productivity growth from that of capital and total factor productivity.
特朗普会继续推动他在今年1月提出将美国从2015年伊朗核协议（正式称为《联合全面行动计划 》 ） 的威胁，除非国会能“修补”该协议。	Trump followed through on his threat in January to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal – formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – if Congress didn’t “fix” it.
事实上，此次复苏期间，私人部门就业增长的速度要远强于2001年的复苏，可以和1990—1991年衰退后的复苏媲美。	Indeed, the pace of private-sector job growth has actually been much stronger during this recovery than during the recovery from the 2001 recession, and is comparable to the recovery from the 1990-1991 recession.
在未来，财政政策和货币政策必须相互配合，不管财政政策还是货币政策，都无法单枪匹马稳定具有内在不稳定性的市场经济。	In the future, fiscal and monetary policy will have to work together: neither on its own can stabilize inherently unstable market economies.
大部分新兴经济体的经济增长放缓至7%以下，而7%是人均收入在一代人的时间内翻一番的所需要达到的阈值。	Economic growth in most emerging economies has slowed below 7%, the threshold needed to double per capita income in a single generation.
讨论内容与去年大不相同，中间的转换似乎颇具戏剧性：没有人会再提到滴入式经济的概念（指一个体制中给予上层人的利益会传递给较低阶层的人 ） ， 也很少人愿意声言社会贡献与私人报酬之间存在密切的一致性。	The shift in the debate from just a year ago seems dramatic: no one even mentions the notion of trickle-down economics anymore, and few are willing to argue that there is a close congruence between social contributions and private rewards.
然而，对于绝大多数欧洲人来说，部署计划对于欧洲稳定和安全更广泛的政治含意要远比军事技术问题重要得多。	For most Europeans, however, the military-technical issues are less important than the broader political implications of deployment for European stability and security.
与此同时乌克兰正在经历一个相对较快的“去美元化”过程，使得目前以格里夫纳存入的银行存款增长速度要高于外币。	At the same time, Ukraine is undergoing a relatively fast “de-dollarization,” such that hryvnia-denominated bank deposits are now growing faster than those in foreign currencies.
1971年，尼克松让美国的贸易伙伴们措手不及：对进口品征收10%的附加税并对日本采取基本食品出口禁运。	In September 1971, Richard Nixon blindsided US trading partners by imposing a 10% surcharge on imports and placing an embargo on exports of essential foodstuffs to Japan.
需要澄清的是，这并不是说要建立一个“转移支付同盟 ” ， 像希腊那样的国家持续转移支付 — — 德国人就怕这个。	To be clear, this is not an argument for Germany’s dreaded “transfer union” – ongoing transfers to countries like Greece.
7月8日 ， 《 纽约时报》在头版刊登了一则略显夸张的标题 ： 《 从股票到农地，到处都是繁荣甚至泡沫：全球各类资产几乎无不高企，带来经济风险 》 （ From Stocks to Farmland, All’s Booming, or Bubbling: Prices for Nearly All Assets around World Are High, Bringing Economic Risks ） 。	On July 8, the New York Times led its front page with a somewhat hyperbolic headline: “From Stocks to Farmland, All’s Booming, or Bubbling: Prices for Nearly All Assets around World Are High, Bringing Economic Risks.”
对于讲英语和讲法语的人来说，该市堪称一个可以提供归属感的相对成功的范本，但针对语言的讨论依然充斥着政治舞台，并塑造了该市居民的某种气质。	Montreal is a relatively successful example of a city in which Anglophones and Francophones both feel at home, but language debates nonetheless dominate the political scene – and structure an ethos for the city’s residents.
库尔德人散布于多个中东国家 — — 伊朗、伊拉克、叙利亚和土耳其 — — 几十年来一直在为建立自己的国家而斗争。	Divided among several Middle Eastern countries – Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey – the Kurds have been fighting for their own state for decades.
Charles Krauthammer高调地将这种观点称为“新单边主义 ” 。 它甚至在2001年“9.11”袭击发生之前都一直对布什政府产生着重要的影响。	Charles Krauthammer celebrated this view as “the new unilateralism,” and it heavily influenced the Bush administration even before the attacks on September 11, 2001.
这台西班牙大戏的演员们正面临着被政治学家称之为社会困境的局面：冲突的任何一方均可从自利行为中获益，除非另外一方也同样采取自利的行为。 但如果双方都坚持自利的原则，那么双方都会失败。	The actors in the Spanish drama are facing what political scientists call a social dilemma: either side gains from selfish behavior unless the other side behaves selfishly, too, in which case both sides lose.
圣地亚哥—在1997年的著名文章中，法利德·扎卡利亚（Fareed Zakaria）创造了“不自由民主”一词来形容用（公正度各异的）选举选择领导人、但限制公民自由和政治自由的国家。	SANTIAGO – In an influential 1997 essay, Fareed Zakaria coined the term “illiberal democracy” to describe those countries that hold elections (of varying fairness) to choose their leaders, yet restrict civil liberties and political freedom.
克里首次访华是向这个方向迈出的首要一步，但必须继之以常规的电话及其他访问模式，以实现消除朝鲜半岛核武器的目标。	Kerry’s first trip to China was a start in this direction, but it must be followed by a regular pattern of telephone calls and additional visits, with a view to ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
内部人士最清楚如何协调互相冲突的利益、如何让制度再次运转起来，容克驾轻就熟地给各委员分配任务就证明了这一点。	An insider knows best how to reconcile contrasting interests and how to get the institutional machinery moving again, as Juncker showed with his deft handling of the distribution of tasks among the individual Commissioners.
该剧以同情的笔触描绘了一位单身母亲墨菲·布朗（由女演员坎迪丝·伯根扮演 ） ， 诸如此类的角色算得上当时电视中的异类。	Murphy Brown, played by actress Candice Bergen, was a TV anomaly at that time: a sympathetically portrayed single mother.
但不幸的是，尽管有这些令人鼓舞的进步信号，但在可能罹患这些可预防疾病的人中，只有40%获得了需要的药物。	But, unfortunately, despite encouraging signs of progress, barely 40% of people at risk for these preventable diseases receive the medicine they require.
而这种全方位直面过去的行为 — — 其许多邻国都做不到这一点 — — 使德国得以和当今的以色列政府划清界限。	And Germany today is able to distance itself – though clearly at the margin – from Israel’s current government because Germans fully confronted their past in ways that many of their neighbors have not.
让全球金融市场自行其是，这些市场就会在经济情况良好的时候，以过于低廉的价格提供了过量的信贷，在经济情况不好的时候提供过少的信贷。	Left to their own devices, global financial markets provide too much credit at too cheap a price in good times, and too little credit in bad times.
因此，在中国增长也开始放缓的情况下，世界经济似乎注定要走一段时间触底之路，一些国家的失业率正在攀向或超过了20 % 。	So, given that Chinese growth, too, is slowing, the world economy seems destined to crawl along the bottom for some time yet, with unemployment rising in some countries to 20% or more.
摩洛哥能源供给97%左右需要进口，自身也不拥有石油或天然气储量，其政府将开发可再生能源视为确保摩洛哥经济持续发展的唯一道路。	Given that Morocco imports around 97% of its energy supply, and possesses no oil or natural gas deposits of its own, the government has viewed developing renewable energy as the only way to ensure the country’s continuing economic development.
至少在多数人的记忆当中，学生领袖不断创造出融马克思主义、精神分析学和第三世界解放斗争理论为一体的令人费解的宣言理论。	Student leaders, or so most people remember, were constantly producing convoluted manifestos that combined Marxism, psychoanalysis, and theories about Third World liberation struggles.
确实，2007年的主要问题就是宏观经济波动是否将会继续下降，进而引发对市场和房地产的又一个投机年份，还是可能出于不断增长的地缘政治中的紧张局势而开始再次上升。	Indeed, the main question for 2007 is whether macroeconomic volatility will continue to decline, fueling another spectacular year for markets and housing, or start to rise again, perhaps due to growing geopolitical tensions.
比如汉森机器人公司就有了一个名叫阿尔伯特的机器人演示模型，其面部表情与大科学家阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦的惊人地相似。	Hanson Robotics has a demonstration model called Albert, whose face bears a striking resemblance to that of Albert Einstein.
特朗普坚持认为巴黎协议是不公平的，因为“印度将被允许在2020年之前将其煤炭产量翻一番 ” ， 而美国却“应停止煤矿生产 ” 。	Trump insists that the Paris deal is unfair, because while “India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020,” the United States is “supposed to get rid of ours.”
自此以后，免疫运动在本地招募工作人员，让他们在本家族内工作，并与地方军事领导人商谈进入开展工作事宜，以此进入叛军控制地区。	Since then, immunization campaigns have improved their access to rebel-controlled areas by employing locally recruited staff to work within their own clans and negotiate access with local-level militant leaders.
与现行的、理想主义的—且明显难以为继的—铲除行动形成鲜明对比的，是农民们在反毒品的计划中还能获得一种主人翁的感觉。	Farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter-narcotics efforts, in sharp contrast to the current idealistic – and evidently un-achievable – policy of crop eradication.
（唯一的例外是广受欢迎和好评的科菲•安南，虽然在其就任前有位非洲人已经在任一届，但安南仍然实现了两届连任。	(The only exception was the extremely popular and well-regarded Kofi Annan, who, despite having succeeded another African after one term, was selected for two consecutive terms.)
在最近一次峰会上，东盟各国一致同意建立一个东盟和平与和解机构，以处理成员国间的相关问题 — — 这是东盟取得的一个里程碑式的成就。	At its recent summit, ASEAN agreed to establish an ASEAN Institute for Peace and Reconciliation that will deal with issues of peace and reconciliation – a milestone achievement for ASEAN.
直到最近，她也许可以得过且过地熬到2018年四年任期结束，不过这只是因为反对党不愿给她的政府所创造的经济烂摊子擦屁股。	Until recently, she seemed likely to muddle through to the end of her four-year term in 2018, if only because opposition parties were reluctant to clean up the economic mess her government created.
在接受麦肯锡调查的年轻人中，只有不到一半具有关于平均薪资水平或他们所选择的的领域的就业机会情况的基本认识。	Fewer than half of the young people that McKinsey surveyed claimed to have even basic knowledge of average wages or the prevalence of job opportunities in their chosen field.
去杠杆化比其他国家更快，更重要的是，资源和产出快速向可贸易部门倾斜，从而填补了内需持续低迷造成的缺口。	Deleveraging has occurred faster than in other countries and, more important, resources and output have quickly shifted to the tradable sector to fill the gap created by persistently weak domestic demand.
共和党方面，唐纳德·特朗普的确切意图不那么明确，尽管他自豪地自称为“债务之王 ” ， 这可不是什么激动人心的事情。	On the Republican side, Donald Trump’s precise intentions are less clear, though he proudly calls himself the “king of debt,” which is not particularly encouraging.
中国学者贝淡宁（Daniel A. Bell）和张维维指出，西方自由民主传统过的主要政治替代品便是在中国不断演化的社会主义派制度。	As the China scholars Daniel A. Bell and Zhang Weiwei have noted, the major political alternative to Western liberal-democratic traditions are the communitarian institutions that continue to evolve in China.
然而转变始于2002年，自那时起土耳其政治逐渐稳定，从而产生了更强土耳其的意愿以及实现这一愿景的坚定承诺。	That began to change in 2002, when an era of political stability dawned, giving rise to a vision for a stronger Turkey – and a firm commitment to realizing that vision.
他们可能会就它的概念写些东西，但是它的含义—在这个世界中他们的国家仅仅是“资格最老的那个 ” — 并没有真正深入这个国家的精神。	They may write about it conceptually, but its meaning – a world in which their country is only “primus inter pares” – has not really penetrated the national psyche.
如果无法实行改革，那么法国和意大利最终也许会在货物、服务和劳动自由流动的问题上食言，甚至也许会放弃欧元，这会给所有的成员国造成破坏性后果。	If they cannot reform, France or Italy eventually may be tempted to renege on free movement of goods, services and labor – and perhaps even abandon the euro – with disruptive consequences for all members.
举个例子，跨太平洋伙伴关系已经停摆，即便是从现在开始再花四年时间估计也难以将其复活，因为到时候东亚国家可能早就被已经被纳入以中国为首的贸易集团中了。	The TPP, for example, is dead. And four years from now will probably be too late to revive it, because by then East Asian countries may have been drawn into a China-led trade grouping instead.
支持这一办法的论据是，长期性、历史性因素是资本流入的重要驱动力，也就是说，发达经济体的投资者发现自己的资产组合中新兴市场资产比重过低，从而采取矫正举措。	The argument for this option is that long-term secular factors are important drivers of capital inflows, as advanced-economy investors discover that they are underweight in emerging-market assets and reduce their portfolios’ “home bias.”
承诺建设包容性、高生产率、高恢复力城市的城市SDG将极大地强化全世界几万座城市，帮助它们开启为其市民、国家和世界建设可持续发展的伟业。	An urban SDG, promoting inclusive, productive, and resilient cities, would greatly empower tens of thousands of cities worldwide to take up the cause of sustainable development for their own citizens, their countries, and the world.
正如我们随后看到的那样，杀戮持续进行，甚至有时就当着联合国维和部队的面，因为他们的国家没有给予足够的授权去干涉。	The result, as we now know, was that the killing continued, sometimes in the presence of UN peacekeepers whose countries had not given them a strong enough mandate to intervene.
有人认为，过去有关气候变化的协议走得不够远，但是 ， 《 京都议定书》实际上被证实是过于雄心勃勃了。	Some believe that past agreements did not go far enough, but Kyoto actually turned out to be overly ambitious.
在美国，总统奥巴马的竞选活动就认识到了这一机会，利用社交媒体全面地传播政治消息以及激发和动员支持者。	In the United States, President Barack Obama’s election campaigns recognized this opportunity, using social media extensively to communicate political messages, and to energize and mobilize supporters.
短期看来他们结盟的可能性似乎没有，不过欧洲似乎已下定决心要变不可能为可能，而不顾整个大陆可能受到的损害。	So an alliance between them would seem a near impossibility. Yet Europe seems bent on achieving the impossible, to the Continent’s detriment.
NEW HAVEN — — 在法国巴黎银行宣布它将冻结其旗下的三只基金后，世界股市8月9日的暴跌只不过是又一个市场最近表现得越发动荡或不对称的例子。	NEW HAVEN -- The sharp drop in the world’s stock markets on August 9, after BNP Paribas announced that it would freeze three of its funds, is just one more example of the markets’ recent downward instability or asymmetry.
革命不但席卷了镇压性政权，也摧毁了旧秩序，造成残酷（如果不是血腥的话）的新权力争夺 — — 这一过程会影响国内和国外政策。	A revolution not only overthrows a repressive regime; it also destroys the old order, paving the way for a mostly brutal, if not bloody, fight for power to establish a new one – a process that affects foreign and domestic policy alike.
结果，成千上万棋手如今出人意料地可以通过教小孩下棋获得很好的收入，而在“深蓝”诞生之前，只有几百人可以真正靠国际象棋为生。	As a result, thousands of players nowadays earn surprisingly good incomes teaching chess to children, whereas in the days before Deep Blue, only a few hundred players could truly make a living as professionals.
简言之，算不上经济专家的普京做出了俄罗斯的所有重大经济政策决定，通过临时性的一对一会面向国有企业的高管和各个部长发出指令。	In short, Putin – who is no economic expert – makes all major economic policy decisions in Russia, delivering orders to top managers of state-owned enterprises and individual ministers in ad hoc, one-on-one meetings.
尽管如此，那些过分乐观的加密狂热分子也还是抓住政策制定者对央行数字货币的考量来试图证明即便是央行也得借助区块链或加密技术来加入这场数字货币游戏。	Nonetheless, starry-eyed crypto-fanatics have seized on policymakers’ consideration of CBDCs as proof that even central banks need blockchain or crypto to enter the digital-currency game.
日本已经基本上实现了充分就业，其国内劳动力需求如此之高，以至于那些新毕业生不仅能找到工作，而且还能挑工作。	And Japan has achieved virtually full employment, with labor demand so high that new graduates are able not just to find jobs, but to choose them.
另外，黎巴嫩的安全和独立也与叙利亚息息相关，叙利亚也在以色列和其阿拉伯邻国之间的冲突中扮演着重要角色。	Moreover, Lebanon’s security and independence hinges on Syria, and Syria is one of the main actors in the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
在那些只知道专政统治的地方，正在进行之中的民主化带来了希望，即至少有一个联合国机构应当体现自由的可能性越来越大。	Ongoing democratization in regions that have known only dictatorship provides hope that the balance is tilting in a way that would enable it possible for at least one UN body should incarnate freedom.
今日世界所缺乏的是具有远见卓识的果敢领导人，因此无法建立重新把核裁军置于和平的全球秩序之核心所需要的信任。	What seem to be lacking today are leaders with the boldness and vision to build the trust needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful global order.
最近几十年来的务实主义集体领导在治理这个问题上做得相当不错，但习近平对权力的巩固，以及对其个人崇拜的形成，有可能加剧动荡。	Collective and pragmatic leadership in recent decades has done a reasonable job of managing the problem, but Xi’s consolidation of power, and the cult of personality surrounding him, could exacerbate instability.
新一代人 — — 受过高等教育，经验丰富，而且在很大程度上都是依靠自身的努力取得的成就 — — 正准备以高超的施政技巧和奉献精神来推动中国的经济和社会进步。	That generation – highly educated, experienced, and, for the most part, successful on their own merits – is prepared to carry China’s economic and social progress forward with great skill and dedication.
东北太平洋地区的强国-中国、日本和韩国-已经成为美国最重要的债权国，金融危机的出现使这些国家的重要性进一步加强。	The Northeastern Pacific powers – China, Japan, and South Korea – are already America’s most significant creditors by far, and their importance will increase further as a result of the financial crisis.
许多国际运动和组织 — — 比如受困的妇女（Women Under Siege ） 、 V-Day和停止针对妇女暴力（Stop Violence Against Women ） — —已开始致力于为妇女赢得公平与安全。	Many international movements and organizations – such as Women Under Siege, V-Day, and Stop Violence Against Women – are already working to deliver justice and security to women.
但西方的容忍也应该有一定限度。 尤其���考虑到首脑会议日程的特色：能源安全、对抗疾病、促进教育、反对恐怖主义和防扩散。	But there need to be limits to the West’s tolerance, particularly given the summit’s agenda, which features energy security, fighting disease, promoting education, counter-terrorism, and non-proliferation.
我所在的公司德国普华永道为第一次到达的难民提供为期十周（对他们来说这是最关键的一段时期）的免费语言和职业培训。	My own firm, PwC Germany, offers a free ten-week language and vocational training course for refugees when they first arrive – the most critical period for them.
中国国家主席习近平的外交政策最高方略是迫使日本政府承认 — — 如果不是接受的话 — — 中国对东海上有争议的钓鱼岛/尖阁列岛的领土要求。	Chinese President Xi Jinping’s top foreign-policy priority is to force the Japanese government to acknowledge, if not accept, China’s territorial claims in the two countries’ dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands in the East China Sea.
这些项目如何落地，以及它们是否具备低碳特征，可能引领未来世界更适应气候变化 — — 否则，它们可能在即将到来的几十年中破坏粮食、水和安全赖以存在的基础。	How these projects proceed, and whether they are designed with low-carbon features, could lead the world toward a more-climate resilient future – or they could undermine food, water, and security for decades to come.
这在最近的北京中国发展论坛上表现得淋漓尽致。 中国发展论坛始于2000年，是每年在“两会”后不久举行一次的重要会议。	That much was clear at the recent China Development Forum (CDF) in Beijing, an important gathering held each year since 2000, immediately after the conclusion of the annual National People’s Congress.
尽管日本学生在国际评比中的排名很高，但普遍缺乏国际商界和科学界通用语英语的训练，这使得日本在全球市场中落在了下风。	While Japanese students rank high in international comparisons, a widespread lack of command of English, the lingua franca of international commerce and science, puts Japan at a disadvantage in the global marketplace.
但到了1960年，这种短期的愉悦已经让位于曾受他利用重新掌权的人们的仇恨，这些人将他视为叛徒，恨不能令他和他一手创立的政权一同消失掉。	But, by 1960, euphoria had given way to rancor among those whom he had used to regain office but who now saw him as a traitor to be neutralized along with the regime he had brought into being.
政府当然在支持学术研究和在风险投资不感兴趣的领域促进应用等方面扮演着重要的角色 — — 比方说城市垃圾或自来水服务领域，虽然单调乏味但却至关重要。	Government certainly has an important role to play in supporting academic research and promoting applications in fields that might be less appealing to venture capital – unglamorous but crucial domains, such as municipal waste or water services.
一直以来都有观点认为疯狂而巨额的股市交易缩短了企业运营视野，而对上述关联的研究也提供了一个极佳的机会来评估这一观点的弱点和含糊不清之处。	And examining that connection provides a good opportunity to assess the weaknesses and ambiguities of the longstanding argument that furiously high-volume stock-market trading shortens corporate time horizons.
5月15日，两家独立的小型能源公司（土耳其Genel Enerji和加拿大Addax石油公司）成了根据与地方政府签订的协议在库尔德控制地区进行石油开采的最新的外国公司。	On May 15, two small independent energy companies (Turkey’s Genel Enerji and Canada’s Addax Petroleum) became the latest foreign firms to begin drilling in Kurdish-controlled territory under an agreement with the regional government.
为了应对这一威胁，icddr,b和联合国儿童基金会、世卫组织和其他重要相关利益方合作启动了多重霍乱防治计划。	In response to this threat, icddr,b is collaborating with UNICEF, the WHO, and other important stakeholders on multiple cholera-prevention initiatives.
如果虚假信息的解决之道在美国尚不明确，那么放在国际背景下就更加棘手，因为在多国背景下问题更加分散和不透明 — — 这也从另一个角度解释了为什么制定综合全面的解决方案是不可能的。	If the solutions to disinformation are unclear in the US, the situation is even thornier in the international context, where the problem is even more decentralized and opaque – another reason why no overarching, comprehensive solution is possible.
法国人必须认识到法律面前人人平等是一个核心原则，但同时也是一个很脆弱的原则；它需要依靠对于如何实现平等更严格的认识才能实现。	The French must recognize that equality before the law is a core principle, but a weak one; it needs to be complemented by a stricter vision of how to achieve equality.
必须杜绝1968年5月革命那样的灾难，因为在萨尔柯齐看来，这场革命的领导者和支持者或许在政治上输给了戴高乐，但他们所强调的“错误价值观”却在接下来的几十年内大大削弱了法国的力量。	The revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968, whose leaders and supporters, according to Sarkozy, may have lost politically to de Gaulle, but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on “false values.”
记得一位俄罗斯知名自由主义者曾在1990年代向我指出，一个在莫斯科的民主政府要比驻在立陶宛维尔纽斯的北约军队更能遏制俄罗斯的侵略思潮。	I remember a leading Russian liberal telling me in the 1990s that a democratic government in Moscow was a much more secure guarantee against Russian adventurism than NATO troops in Vilnius.
畅通的信贷、更多的工作、汇款、大宗商品繁荣以及有条件的现金转账让数百万人买了房子和汽车，过上了更美好的生活。	Access to credit, more jobs, remittances, the commodity boom, and conditional cash transfers enabled millions to purchase a home, a car, and a better life.
根据最新研究，如果不通过补助、贷款和担保等形式获得联邦政府的支持与合作，美国的影响力投资根本无法生存。	According to a recent study, impact investing in the US would not exist without the support of and partnership with the federal government through grants, loans, and guarantees.
当利物浦和曼彻斯特铁路线终于在1830年开通时，它带来了一场革命性的胜利，不仅开启了蒸汽时代，而且以人们从未预见的方式改变了世界。	When the L&M Railway eventually opened in 1830, it was a revolutionary success, kickstarting the age of steam and changing the world in ways that could not have been foreseen.
2005年，我们兰德公司的同事预测，如果医疗卫生业可以复制其他行业曾发生过的IT驱动生产率的过程，美国每年可以节约800亿美元。	In 2005, colleagues of ours at the RAND Corporation projected that America could save more than $80 billion a year if health care could replicate the IT-driven productivity gains observed in other industries.
真正的反种族主义者、反帝国主义者以及信奉共和民主者，在现代化和和平伊斯兰教与沙拉菲派的犯罪伊斯兰教的战争中必须站在前者一方。	Genuine anti-racists, anti-imperialists, and believers in republican democracy must take the side of the Islam of moderation and peace in its war against the criminal Islam of the Salafists.
伦敦帝国理工学院的许多工科毕业生被投资银行花大价钱招至麾下，好让他们发明精密的金融结构而非桥梁或机床。	Many engineering graduates from London’s Imperial College were seduced by investment banks, which paid them extravagantly for inventing elaborate financial structures rather than bridges or machine tools.
但到目前为止，欧盟一直不愿对欧尔班政权采取严厉的惩罚行动，因为它不想冒险将匈牙利进一步推向俄罗斯的怀抱。	But, so far, the EU has been reluctant to take serious punitive action against Orbán’s regime, because it does not want to risk pushing Hungary further into Russia’s embrace.
比如，谈判者可以增加即可驳回滥诉（frivolous suits）的条款，跨国公司以影响其盈利能力为由挑战新监管措施即属于滥诉的一种。	For example, negotiators could add provisions for the summary dismissal of frivolous suits, such as challenges by multinational corporations to a new regulation on the grounds that it will diminish their ability to earn profits.
因此显而易见的问题就是特朗普政府怎么可以依据这堆站不住脚的证据去制定一项增加关税这样后患无穷的政策决定 — — 这可能会引发灾难性的贸易战。	The obvious question is how the Trump administration can base a policy decision as consequential as trade tariffs – which could trigger a catastrophic trade war – on such weak evidence.
年轻的卡洛琳肃穆地站在朝父亲棺椁敬礼三岁的弟弟身边 — — 受尼尔·戴蒙德（Neil Diamond）名曲的启发 — — 这一形象深深地刻在日本人民心头。	The image of young Caroline – the inspiration for Neil Diamond’s famous song – solemnly standing beside her three-year-old brother as he saluted his father’s coffin is deeply engrained in the hearts of Japan’s people.
这样做，中国不仅不会令全球性公司及其所在国忧心忡忡，而且会在国外维持强大的政治资源的支持以及获得继续发展所需要的投资流入。	Rather than scaring global corporations and their home states, China would retain strong political support abroad – and the financing that it needs for its continued development.
在许多贫穷国家（印度和韩国除外，它们已经发展起了优秀的教育制度 ） ， 最聪明的公民往往都是在国外接受的教育。	In many poor countries, except those like India and South Korea, which have now developed superb educational institutions, the brightest citizens receive their education abroad.
该协议的重点不在于报复和复仇，而在于打破种族隔离制度后德斯蒙德·图图大主教曾借以形容南非向多数人统治过渡的“恢复性司法”原则。	Its focus is not on vengeance and retribution, but on “restorative justice,” a principle Archbishop Desmond Tutu used to describe South Africa’s transition to majority rule after apartheid.
相比而言，许多资金转移，如失业福利，卫生福利，公共养老金等，都与通货膨胀挂钩，从而维持了其实际价值。	By contrast, many transfers, such as unemployment benefits, health benefits, and public pensions, are indexed to inflation, and thus maintain their real value.
法国许多人认为新总统萨尔科奇是一个亲美国的外交政策上的鹰派，但即使是他也正在从他的保持军费开支在GDP的2%的竞选许诺中退缩。	Even France’s new president, Nicolas Sarkozy – thought by many to be a pro-American foreign policy hawk – is backing away from his campaign promise to maintain defense spending at 2% of GDP.
其中的好处是日本和印度对叙利亚和平进程的兴趣可以刺激中国在签署、而非阻碍解决方案的达成方面发挥积极的作用。	A bonus here is that Japanese and Indian interest in the Syrian peace process could spur China to play an active role in reaching, rather than blocking, a solution.
但这一趋同的推动力与一代又一代经济学家指出旧秩序不再适用时所设想的不同，它们有着令人不安的潜在影响。	But the forces driving this convergence have little to do with what generations of economists envisaged when they pointed out the inadequacy of the old order; and these forces’ implications may be equally unsettling.
我碰到了丹麦性别，平等和种族信息中心的主管伊丽莎白·穆勒·詹森，她所在的是个受丹麦文化部资助而且非同寻常的机构。	I met Elisabeth Møller Jensen, the director of KVINFO, “the Danish center for information on gender, equality and ethnicity” – an extraordinary organization funded by Denmark’s Ministry of Culture.
2015年10月，来自IREX — — 它由加拿大政府资助，并得到乌克兰本地组织的支持 — — 的专家们推出了一个名为“学会辨别 ” （ Learn to Discern，L2D）的为期九个月的媒体素养培训课程。	In October 2015, experts from IREX – backed by funding from the Canadian government and the support of local Ukrainian organizations – launched a nine-month media literacy-training course called Learn to Discern (L2D).
但巴基斯坦的伊斯兰主义者却未能得到如此安抚。 就在上个月穆沙拉夫命其外交部长展开与以色列的首次官方接触时，他对伊斯兰主义者再次大发雷霆。	No so Pakistan’s Islamists, however, whom Musharraf infuriated yet again last month, when he ordered his foreign minister to initiate the first official contact with Israel.
美国天然及价格已经降到略高于4美元/百万英热（几年前高达13美元 ） ， 即使是谨慎的分析师也认为页岩能源革命将提振美国潜在经济增长并增加多大200万个新工作岗位。	With US natural-gas prices down to just over $4 per million BTU (from $13 just a few years ago), even prudent analysts expect the shale-energy revolution to increase America’s potential economic growth and add as many as two million new jobs.
中国的改革要么将支持经济转型、提振信心并提高增长预期，要么将令人失望，将主要注意力集中于国家干预市场的规模和性质上。	China’s reforms will either support the economic shift, boosting sentiment and lifting growth forecasts, or they will fall short and disappoint, with attention most likely to be focused on the size and nature of state intervention in markets.
关键在于未来的决策不能只是为了维持伦敦金融城作为欧洲金融中心的角色，而是确保英国提供的服务能有助于加强欧洲的资本市场。	The key is to base decisions not on sustaining the City of London’s role as Europe’s financial hub, but on ensuring that the services provided strengthen Europe’s capital markets.
在上个月在索尔伯恩（Sorbonne）所做的涵盖面甚广的讲话中，法国总统马克龙便呼吁建立一个欧洲货币基金组织，尽管他并没有具体阐述他所构想的细节。	In his wide-ranging speech at the Sorbonne last month, French President Emmanuel Macron called for the creation of a European Monetary Fund, though he did not spell out the details of what he envisions.
对比美国国会预算办公室在危机前（2008年1月）和危机后发布的中期预测，这一债务的增加额相当于GDP的40 % ， 足以令人震惊不已了。	Comparing the US Congressional Budget Office’s medium-term forecasts before (in January 2008) and after the crisis, this debt increase is a staggering 40% of GDP.
有那么一瞬间，当美国人投票给另一位充满希望的年轻人，也就是他们的首位黑人总统时，美国看似重新赢得了20世纪60年代初曾经拥有的信誉。	For a brief moment, when Americans voted for their first black president, another young and hopeful figure, it looked as if the US had regained some of the prestige that it enjoyed in the early 1960’s.
尽管具体的代际界限划分或多或少带有任意性，但它们反映了一个重要趋势：军事前线和民用后方分界日益模糊。	While particular generational delineations are somewhat arbitrary, they reflect an important trend: the blurring of the military front and the civilian rear.
在确定2016年的“八大任务”中，李克强将供给侧改革排在第二 — — 仅次于应对增长放缓的经济稳定政策。	In identifying the top “eight tasks” for 2016, Li put supply-side reforms at number two – second only to the government’s focus on economic stability in countering China’s growth slowdown.
这个问题值得考虑。 他是奥维尔的老师，写过另外一部伟大的预言性政治小说 ― ― 《美丽新世界 》 。	It is worth considering whether Aldous Huxley, who taught Orwell at school and who wrote another great and portentous piece of political fiction, Brave New World, provides a more relevant perspective.
加布里埃尔·租客满（Gabriel Zucman）的新书《隐匿的财富帝国：避税港之祸 》 （ The Hidden Wealth of Nations: The Scourge of Tax Havens）以前所未有的尺度曝光了避税港在全球经济中的角色。	And a new book by Gabriel Zucman, The Hidden Wealth of Nations: The Scourge of Tax Havens, reveals, as never before, the extent of their role in the global economy.
如今，共和党和民主党之间的电视辩论已经结束，总统奥巴马及其共和党挑战者罗姆尼仍要在10月份经历三次面对面交锋，才能决出输赢。	Now that the made-for-television Republican and Democratic conventions are over, the odyssey of President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, continues with three face-to-face encounters in October.
在世界政经金字塔的顶端，7国集团（G7）不得不让位给代表性更强的20国集团（G20 ） ， 将中国和印度当作全权合作伙伴纳入决策圈内。	At the apex of the pyramid, the G-7 was obliged to give way to the broader G-20, bringing countries like China and India into the decision-making nexus as full partners.
印度已经从农业经济转变为服务驱动型经济，工业几乎没有增长，这一事实绝非值得好事；这是阻碍制造业和采矿业发展的政策带来的后果。	The fact that India has moved from an agricultural economy to a service-driven economy with almost no growth in industry is not a virtue; it is an outcome of policies that have hampered manufacturing and mining.
而且，185个美国CEO最近联名写信给德国总理安吉拉·默克尔（Angela Merkel）和欧盟其他27个国家政府，声称欧盟已经再次越权，对爱尔兰和欧洲经济造成了“自残的伤口 ” 。	And, in a recent joint letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU’s other 27 national governments, 185 American CEOs alleged that the EU had over-reached yet again, resulting in a “self-inflicted wound” for Ireland’s and Europe’s economy.
即使考虑了一些女性必须承担不受薪的家务劳动以及女性教育成本的增加，其损失至少占1900年全球GDP的17 % 。	Even taking into account that someone has to do unpaid housework and the increased costs of female education, the loss was at least 17% of global GDP in 1900.
该框架建议政策制定者去识别出那些拥有类似的资源和技术，但人均收入两倍于本国的国家中那些发展势头良好并已投入商业运营的产业。	This framework suggests that policymakers identify tradable industriesthat have performed well ingrowing countrieswith similar resources and skills, and with a per capita income about double their own.
用S&P/Case-Shiller全国住房价格指数衡量，2006年6月—2009年3月美国房价下跌了30%多，而欧洲国家（包括西班牙、爱尔兰和英国）也经历了类似或更大的跌幅。	US house prices – as measured by the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index – fell by more than 30% from June 2006 to March 2009, while European countries, including Spain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, experienced similar or greater declines.
同样，由于领导人普遍对主权债务的迅速增加表示忧虑，因此无论其优点如何，财政政策几乎肯定会受到限制，尤其是在各主要发达经济体。	Likewise, regardless of their merits, fiscal policies will almost certainly be constrained by leaders’ fears of rapidly rising sovereign debt, especially in the major advanced economies.
由于欧盟-美国谈判可能困难而持久，特别是考虑到欧洲和美国监管者的抵制，重启多边主义的需要就更加重要了。	The need to revive multilateralism is all the more important given that EU-US negotiations will likely be difficult and prolonged, owing especially to resistance from European and American regulators.
在历史学家眼中，雅克·希拉克总统作为补偿者的价值主要表现在他勇敢地用全国性的忏悔活动为法国少数民族弥补他们的历史创伤以及与国家的创伤。	In the eyes of historians, President Jacques Chirac’s redeeming value will most probably remain his courageous attempt to reconcile France’s wounded minorities with their past and the French nation through a national process of repentance.
第三，目前中国不得不依靠新一轮的货币、财政和信贷刺激来支撑其不平衡且不持续的增长模式，其增长过去一直依赖于过度出口和固定投资、高储蓄和低消费。	Third, China has had to rely on another round of monetary, fiscal, and credit stimulus to prop up an unbalanced and unsustainable growth model based on excessive exports and fixed investment, high saving, and low consumption.
不幸的是，许多储蓄组织尽管十分重要，却没有实现规模；大部分此类组织脱离官方服务运转，这削弱了它们的效果。	Unfortunately, many savings groups, as important as they are, do not scale; most operate in isolation from official services, which weakens their effectiveness.
首先，如果我们不缓解温室气体的排放，气候变化的负面影响将很难逆转，对人类和其他物种可能造成巨大的苦难，甚至危险。	First, if we do not mitigate emissions of GHGs, the negative effects of climate change will be difficult to reverse, implying great hardship and possibly danger to mankind and other species.
因此 ， “ 银行恢复力应该会更强，财务应该会更稳定 ， ” 其结果“应该是更少银行会倒闭，信用供给更加连贯 。 ”	As a result, “banks should become more resilient and financially stable,” the consequences of which “should be seen in fewer bank failures and more consistent credit provision.”
他们在经济问题上也有明显的领先优势，而新闻媒体一直在支持该党关于增长与就业复苏以及低通胀正在让整个经济获益的主张。	They have a substantial lead on economic issues as well, as the news continues to support the party’s contention that the recovery in growth and employment, along with low inflation, are now benefiting the entire country.
在一些政治家和商业领袖中，如果竞争被认为是不公平的，那么欧盟委员会就应该召集使用新的保护贸易的措施，这几乎成为他们的一种本能反应。	It is almost an instinct among some politicians and business leaders that if competition is deemed unfair, the European Commission should marshal new trade defenses.
欧洲公众发现：在2008~2009年间为了预防更大危机而推行的财政刺激计划非但没有制造更多就业，反而加重了债务。	The European public has discovered that the 2008-2009 fiscal stimulus programs, which were aimed at forestalling an even greater crisis, generated more debts than jobs.
1947—2010年间，美国制造业实现了760%的累计真实（经通胀调整的）生产率增幅，而建筑业只有6 % 。	Between 1947 and 2010, US manufacturing achieved 760% cumulative real (inflation-adjusted) productivity growth, compared to just 6% for construction.
与此同时，欧洲中央银行出台了其1万亿欧元（折合1.3万亿美元）长期再融资行动，将欧洲银行系统从悬崖边缘拉了回来。	At the same time, the European Central Bank unleashed its €1 trillion ($1.3 trillion) long-term refinancing operation, which pulled the European banking system back from the brink.
而如今的埃及新领导人也继承了穆巴拉克所面对的两难局面 — — 如何在不惹怒沙特金主的情况下实现该国领导阿拉伯世界的远大抱负？	Egypt’s new leaders have inherited Mubarak’s dilemma – how to realize the country’s aspiration to lead the Arab world without angering its Saudi benefactors.
此外，在他在危机前所撰写的专栏文章中，至少有一篇与他现今的观点完全相悖。 他最近指出，当前 — — 甚至更高的 — — 联邦债务水平根本不会带来风险。	Moreover, at least one of his pre-crisis columns flatly contradicts his view today that current – or even higher – levels of federal debt carry no risk whatsoever.
这并不是说中国构成了巨大的军事威胁，与美国或者甚至是日本的战争只是少数极端民族主义的怪人和偏执狂臆想出来的事物。	This is not because China poses a great military threat – war with the United States, or even Japan, is only a fantasy in the minds of a few ultra-nationalist cranks and paranoiacs.
不过即便美国极端过分的军事预算得到大幅削减（目前这项计划遭到两党的一致反对 ） ， 仍有必要增加新的税收。	But even if America’s wildly excessive military budget is cut sharply (and politicians in both parties are resisting that), there will still be a need for new taxes.
随着欧元的实行以及通货膨胀的消退，名义差异和真实差异都出现了类似幅度的扩大，自二十世纪九十年代中叶以来都一直在逐渐扩大。	With the introduction of the euro, and with falling inflation, nominal convergence and real convergence have grown similar, both making gradual progress since the mid-1990’s.
在低产出高失业率经济体中，对结构性改革的政治抵制 — — 特别来自年纪较大的职工 — — 将会更加强硬，因为在这种形势下丢掉工作显然日子更难过。	Political resistance to structural reforms – especially from older incumbent workers – will be stronger in a low-output, high-unemployment economy, because it is worse to be laid off in such conditions.
保守逊尼派，比方说奉行原教旨主义瓦哈比教派更推崇政教合一的专制统治，而相对温和的苏菲逊尼派则更钟情于自由和包容的政治制度。	Conservative Sunnis, such as those who adhere to fundamentalist Wahhabism, favor theocratic authoritarian rule, whereas more moderate Sufi Sunnis would prefer liberal and inclusive political systems.
到目前为止，这项工作取得了了不起的成功，过去三十年来共有近100种破坏臭氧层的化学物质逐步停止使用。	So far, it has been a remarkable success, with nearly 100 ozone-destroying chemicals phased out over the past three decades.
保险资讯中心的一份报告显示，截至1月份，路易斯安纳州将近70％的屋主都已得到赔偿，赔偿总额达75亿美元。	According to a report from the Insurance Information Institute, nearly 70% of homeowners’ claims in Louisiana were settled by the end of January, for a total of $7.5 billion dollars.
尽管如此，也许是为保护市场地位和内部工作的缘故，一提到事先公布相关标准他们都讳莫如深（即使创新企业预先要求也不例外 ） 。	Nevertheless, they are reticent about providing such specifications in advance – even when innovators request them – perhaps to protect their market position or internal efforts.
设计合理的获取和受益分享机制为贫穷国家提供了机会。 这些国家拥有全球剩余基因资源的一大部分，可以开始为维持这些资源而接收报偿。	An intelligently designed ABS regime offers the chance for poorer countries, which possess the lion’s share of the globe’s remaining genetic resources, to begin to be paid properly for maintaining them.
如果先进的发达国家履行其承诺以帮助世界上最贫穷的人，增加其对外援助预算到占国内生产总值的0.7 ％ ， 这也将起一定作用。	It would also help if the advanced developed countries fulfilled their commitments to helping the world’s poorest by increasing their foreign-aid budgets to 0.7% of GDP.
而这些混杂的信号则进一步激发了中国的民族主义情绪，许多城市爆发了反日游行，连日本大使的专车都遭到了袭击。	Such mixed signals have further inflamed nationalist sentiments in China, and anti-Japanese demonstrations have broken out in many Chinese cities, including an attack on the Japanese ambassador’s official vehicle.
即便政治家们完全意识到不作为将引发极大的灾难，他们也很难去说服选民或者那些短视的政党成员去支付一些短期成本。	Even if politicians have perfect foresight of the disaster that awaits if nothing is done, they may have little ability to persuade voters, or less insightful party members, that the short-term costs must be paid.
还是应该以折扣的价格购买那些从长期来看值得投资的资产？ 还是以溢价来购买私人投资者不愿意购买的资产？	Should they buy up assets at what they believe is a discount from their long-run values, or buy up assets that private investors are unwilling to trade, even at a premium above their likely long-run values?
比如，巴西对资本内流的抱怨声最大，因为其货币在很短的时期里过度升值，但罪魁祸首其实是国内工资上涨和过热，而不是美联储的政策。	For example, Brazil complained most vocally about capital inflows, because its currency had over-appreciated in a short period of time; but the main culprits were domestic wage increases and overheating, not the Fed’s policies.
许多兰花的花朵极为精致，演化为可以欺骗雄蜂或雄性胡蜂前来试图与它们交配的形态，从而确保得到定期授粉。	Many of them have extremely elaborate flowers that have evolved to trick male bees or wasps into trying to copulate with them, thereby ensuring that they are regularly pollinated.
因此，新政府的立场将是至关重要的：支持塞浦路斯解决方案对土耳其十分有利；但土耳其也有可能老方一帖，放弃眼前千载难逢的良机。	The new administration’s stance will thus be critical: Turkey has much to gain by supporting a solution in Cyprus; but it could also revert to old habits and spoil today’s unique opportunity.
此外，由于社会保障只能取代低收入员工40%的退休前收入（以及中位收入员工不到三分之一的退休前收入 ） ， 依赖社会保证作为唯一收入来源的群体将在贫困线上下挣扎。	And, because Social Security replaces only about 40% of pre-retirement income for low-wage workers and less than a third for median-wage workers, those who rely on it as their sole source of income live at or below the poverty line.
因为这在今天还无法预测，因此从长远来看的首要挑战在于启动减排和学习过程，并能有效刺激提高能源效率的技术，同时降低二氧化碳排放。	As these are still unknown today, the initial challenge will be to jump-start the mitigation and learning processes, and create powerful incentives for technology that will increase energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions in the long run.
每一位核设施工作人员 — — 从警卫到科学家和高层管理人员 — — 都必须将核材料的安保问题作为工作的核心之一。	Each and every employee at a nuclear facility – from guards to scientists to senior staff – must view the security of nuclear materials as an essential part of their jobs.
伯克利—在《二十一世纪资本论 》 （ Capital in the Twenty-First Century）中，法国经济学家托马斯·皮凯蒂（Thomas Piketty）强调了北美和欧洲在一战之前的镀金时代和二战后的几十年之间的向明对比。	BERKELEY – In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the French economist Thomas Piketty highlights the striking contrasts in North America and Europe between the Gilded Age that preceded World War I and the decades following World War II.

2013年鲁哈尼当选上台时，伊朗正遭遇35%的通胀，伊朗货币在此前一年中贬值了三分之二，还有国际制裁压得经济喘不过气来。	When Rouhani was elected in 2013, Iran was suffering from 35% inflation, the national currency had depreciated by two-thirds in the previous year, and international sanctions were crippling the economy.
我们生活在世俗的世界里，自由言论很容易转变成不得体、不负责任的嘲讽，而其他人视宗教为其最高目标，甚至是最后一线希望。	We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
该国经济成长稳健并且拥有世界上增长最快的股票市场。 但是自从去年十二月总统选举结果受到质疑以来，这些并没有帮助这个国家避免一场日益加剧的政治危机以及种族暴力事件。	Solid economic expansion and one of the world’s fastest-growing stock markets have not helped the country avert a deepening political crisis and mounting ethnic violence since disputed presidential election results in December.
大规模债务融资将中国信贷占GDP的比率提高到近200 % ， 凸显出金融系统的脆弱性 — — 不久前的银行同业拆借利率飙升就反映了这一点。	Large-scale, debt-funded capital investments have raised the country’s credit/GDP ratio to nearly 200%, increasing the financial system’s vulnerability – a development reflected in the recent spike in interbank interest rates.
同样，欧盟一些成员国政府将“优惠伙伴关系 ” （ Privileged Partnership）作为正式成员国地位之外的另一种选择，明确加入谈判框架的意图也不应该成为一个障碍。	The same is true of the reported intention of some EU governments to have the so-called “Privileged Partnership” concept explicitly included in the negotiating framework as an alternative to full membership.
发自纽约 — — 是什么驱使法国穆斯林青年默罕默德·默拉杀害了三名犹太儿童，一名犹太教拉比还有三名士兵 — — 其中两名还是和他一样的穆斯林？	NEW YORK – What possessed the young French Muslim Mohammed Merah to murder three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi, and three soldiers, two of them fellow Muslims?
相反，她带领着一个团队，执行从源头上截取核武器的组件，迅速转移到美国，稍作修改以使之失效，再替换回去的任务。	On the contrary, she led a team that intercepted components of nuclear weapons at their source, whisked them away to the United States, altered them slightly so that they would not work, and replaced them.
ACH是东盟对话伙伴国家开设的第一家此类学院，我们希望它成为韩国和东盟成员国之间文化和人际交流的枢纽。	The ACH is the first of its kind to be opened in an ASEAN dialogue partner country, and it is expected to serve as a hub for cultural and people-to-people exchanges between Korea and ASEAN members.
但是，除非我们能够正本清源，否则这一意识形态将继续威胁全世界数百万年轻人的生命机遇，破坏我们的安全。	But, until we clean the soil in which this poisonous plant takes root, it will continue to blight the life chances of millions of young people around the world – and jeopardize our own security.
随后数年里全欧洲尸横遍野，整个二十年代都是风雨飘摇，法西斯主义和共产主义上台，最终导致在二次大战期间死亡无以计数的数百万人口。	The years that followed witnessed pan-European carnage, instability throughout the 1920’s, and the rise of fascism and communism, culminating in the death of countless millions during World War II.
相比之下在乌克兰，5岁以下儿童死亡率仅有轻微下降，从万分之25变成了24，而预期寿命则从70岁下降到了68岁。	In Ukraine, by contrast, under-five child mortality rates have fallen only slightly, from 25 per 10,000 live births to 24, while life expectancy has declined from 70 years to 68.
显然，欧洲委员会领袖已经在这方面采取了举措， 宣布今年2月对英国做出的让步无效，并公开宣称“不会再有重新谈判的机会 ” 。	Sensibly, European Commission leaders have already moved in this direction by voiding concessions made by the EU to the UK back in February and declaring that there “will be no renegotiation.”
尽管他除掉了本·拉登、削弱了基地组织，但仍有一些反恐政策仍让他在中东和巴基斯坦等地的欢迎度受到了影响。	And while he eliminated Osama bin Laden and weakened Al Qaeda, some counterterrorism policies ended up undercutting his appeal in places like the Middle East and Pakistan.
耸人听闻的媒体报道扭曲了海平面上升的事实，这是危险的，因为它们不必要地引发了人们的恐慌，并促使政策制定者采取了代价过于昂贵的措施，来减少温室气体排放。	Alarming media stories that twist the facts about rising sea levels are dangerous because they scare people unnecessarily and push policymakers toward excessively expensive measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
欧盟在《里斯本条约》已经耗费了巨大的谈判代价，因此如果条约第二次还是通不过的话，那么欧盟将无力批准和实现其预定计划，而这无疑将导致政策瘫痪和制度腐化。	Much negotiating blood has been spilled on the Treaty, and its rejection a second time by Irish voters would leave the Union unable to ratify and implement its provisions; this would inevitably lead to policy paralysis and institutional decay.
剩余的欧元系统中的Target债权也将灰飞烟灭，德国联邦银行和荷兰央行只能寄望于其他存活的央行分担损失。	The Target claims of the remaining euro system will then vanish into thin air, and the Bundesbank and the Dutch central bank will only be able to hope that other surviving central banks participate in their losses.
IMF执委会的简单多数就可以向理事会（Board of Governors）提出建议，而理事会需要85%以上多数方可形成将改革分为两个部分的决议。	A simple majority of the IMF’s Executive Board would recommend it to the Board of Governors, where a resolution separating the reforms into two parts would require 85% of the votes.
有人问，金氏隐士王国有什么价值，能让中国做不出果断决策；还有人不知道中国领导人会在多大程度上由于担心国内问题而继续抑制其教训朝鲜的意图。	Some ask what “value” Kim’s hermit kingdom provides that prevents China from acting decisively; others wonder to what extent Chinese leaders’ domestic concerns continue to inhibit their willingness to switch course on North Korea.
“如果我在学校取得成功，就能过上机会更多的更好的生活 — — 可以帮助到我的家庭和社区 ， ” 她说。	“If I succeed in school, I can have a better life with more opportunity – and I can help my family and community,” she declares.
不出所料，旅游业因此下滑：前往泰姬陵的外国游客数量在2012~2015年间下降了35 ％ ， 国内游客数量也有所减少。	Unsurprisingly, tourism is down: the number of foreign visitors to the Taj Mahal fell by 35% from 2012 to 2015, and domestic tourism has also declined.
更大的数据集让经济史学家能够比以往更有效地解决一些关键问题 — — 比如不同时间和地点的总体经济环境如何影响劳动力参与决策。	Larger data sets are enabling economic historians to address key questions – for example, how aggregate economic conditions affect labor-force participation decisions in different times and places – more effectively than ever before.
对那些记得《全家福 》 （ All in the Family）剧情的人来说，她可以用来与纽约皇后区粗鲁的无产阶级家长阿尔奇·邦克（Archie Bunker）作比较。	For those who remember the show “All in the Family,” she might be usefully compared to Archie Bunker, the crude proletarian patriarch from Queens, New York.
约有40万名学生目前处于这类学习轨道上，而这类人往往高中毕业都无法用乌克兰语来工作交流 — — 而乌克兰语则是该国企业所使用的语言。	About 400,000 students are currently on such a track, which has usually ended with students graduating high school lacking even a working knowledge of Ukrainian – the language in which the country conducts its business.
几个月前的财政赤字为1500亿美元。 现在数字会变的更大 — — 实际上，加州已经有400亿美元的财政赤字了。	The total shortfalls were estimated at $150 billion a few months ago; now the number must be much larger – indeed, California alone faces a shortfall of $40 billion.
大多数伊朗政治人物—至少是那些被政府允许公开行使职权的—都支持该计划，但却倾向于用一种更谨慎和不张扬的方式。	Most Iranian politicians – at least those allowed by the government to function openly – support the program, but favor a quieter and more cautious approach.
但是，不论谁在5月入主青瓦台，他 — — 以及他所在政党 — — 的责任将是应对朴槿惠完全没有能力解决的挑战。	But, regardless of who arrives at the Blue House in May, their job – and the job of their party – will be to tackle the challenges that Park was so ill equipped to address.
去年，被动型基金的规模比主动型管理基金增长了4.5倍，缩小了23.9万亿美元主动管理资产与6.7万亿美元被动管理资产之间的规模差距。	Last year alone, passive funds grew 4.5 times faster than actively managed funds, narrowing the gap between the $23.9 trillion in actively managed assets and $6.7 trillion in passively managed assets.
但是，越来越猖獗的逃税现象表明这些机制充其量只是一种猫捉老鼠的游戏，而且看上去更多的时候老鼠是这场游戏的获胜者。	But, as the rising tide of tax evasion suggests, these mechanisms amount only to a cat game of and mouse problem – and the mice, it seems, are winning.
但是如今这场意识形态驱动的争论过于简单化了一个极其复杂的问题 — — 并被一些我们并不完全了解的过程所影响。	But today’s ideology-driven debates oversimplify an issue that is exceedingly complex – and affected by processes that we do not fully understand.

当然，美国的这些引起不安的行为是有许多因素引起的，但是，其中一个重要的因素是反知识主义，最近共和党副总统候选人萨拉. 佩林快速走红就是一个例证。	While many factors contributed to America’s destabilizing actions, a powerful one is anti-intellectualism, exemplified recently by Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin’s surging popularity.
欧元缔造者对这一缺陷心知肚明，但他们认为，随着需求的出现，更进一步所需要的政治意愿自然而然就会产生。	Its architects were fully aware of this deficiency, but believed that when the need arose, the political will could be summoned to take the next step forward.
英国人没有像他们对僧迦罗人的坎迪国王那样废黜马来的统治者，从而一开始就在宪法上确保了马来人的原住民地位。	The British, who did not depose the Malay rulers as they did the Singhalese king in Kandy, made sure that the native position of the Malays was constitutionally secure from the start.
一个政府任命的委员会最近建议审核委员会至认定资格（即进行观众评级 ） ， 只在非常有限的情况下才有权审查内容。	A government-appointed committee recently recommended that the board be confined to certification (or issuing audience ratings), with the power to censor content only in rare circumstances.
纽约—2011年7月挪威大屠杀和最近威斯康星州奥克利克（Oak Creek）袭击锡克教徒事件都是想把世界带回他们的新纳粹梦想的右翼极端分子所为。	NEW YORK – The massacre in Norway in July 2011 and the recent attack on a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, were the work of right-wing extremists who sought to remake the world in their neo-Nazi image.
关于汇率的适宜范围，央行的确需要建立一个与时俱进的立场。 并且当它认为货币朝着错误的方向行进时，还应该发出信号。	The central bank does need to have a view, updated over time, about the exchange rate’s appropriate range, and it should signal when it thinks the currency is moving in the wrong direction.
1988年波兰爆发的两次罢工浪潮，迫使雅鲁泽尔斯基（Jaruzelski）将军的政府和团结工会进行谈判，在进行了几个月的较量之后，团结工会被合法化了。	Two waves of strikes in 1988 forced General Jaruzelski’s government to negotiate with Solidarity, which, after a few months of hedging, was legalized.
当外国政府太愚蠢以至于拒绝美国道路时，他们应该因为伤害美国的利益（普世利益的代名词）进而威胁美国安全而受到惩罚。	When foreign governments are foolish enough to reject the American way, they should expect retribution for harming US interests (seen to align with universal interests) and thereby threatening US security.
众议院议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）和参议院共和党领导层在贸易、移民和预算赤字等问题上的观点都要比特朗普更加接近共和党主流。	House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership in the Senate have more mainstream GOP views than Trump on trade, migration, and budget deficits.
在我结束了在乌兹别克斯坦军队里的强制服役之后，在1998年12月份，我就开始了走向关塔纳摩的旅途了。	My journey to Guantánamo began in December 1998, after I finished my mandatory service in the Uzbek army.
巴黎 — — 突尼斯的“茉莉花革命”还没有结束，但从中我们已经可以看到民主和民主化进程的影响将远远超出马格里布。	PARIS – Tunisia’s “Jasmine Revolution” is still unfolding, but we can already read into it lessons about democracy and democratization that extend far beyond the Maghreb.
而实际上，正是台湾的资本和知识建立起了中国的高科技工业，而目前大概有超过50万台湾人在上海附近一个复制新竹工业园（台湾的矽谷）模式的工业园区工作和生活着。	Indeed, Taiwanese capital and know-how built much of China’s hi-tech industries, and well over a half-million Taiwanese live and work near Shanghai in a virtual replica of Hsin Chu, Taiwan’s Silicon Valley.
要避免这样的结果，亚洲国家需要改变游戏规则，让年轻人不论出身贵贱与否，都能获得在收入阶梯上向上攀爬的机会。	To avoid such a future, Asian countries need to change the rules of the game, providing opportunities for youth, whatever their background, to ascend the income ladder.
近些年来，单单中国政府就在非洲的基础设施和资源采掘上投资了几十亿美元，从而使人们怀疑他们正在对非洲实行一轮新的掠夺。	In recent years, China’s government alone has invested billions of dollars in African infrastructure and resource extraction, raising suspicions that a new scramble for Africa is underway.
智利希望从外部得到高企的商品价格、极低的美元利率和充足的国际流动性；而自2010年以来，这些都得到了满足。	Sky-high commodity prices, rock-bottom dollar interest rates, and ample international liquidity are what Chile hopes for in the rest of the world; they are also precisely what Chile got since 2010.
简而言之，美国以及其他大国需要与朝鲜进行建设性的经济接触，以帮助该国政权借经济转型与融入全球经济之力、实现“繁荣富强”的目标。	Simply put, the US and other powers need to pursue constructive economic engagement with North Korea to help the regime achieve “strength and prosperity” through economic transition and integration with the global economy.
25年来最严重的经济减速让预算赤字扩大到创纪录的水平，巴西总统罗塞夫被迫转向紧缩，包括削减失业救济的福利补贴。	With the most severe economic slowdown in 25 years expanding the budget deficit to record levels, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has been forced to turn to austerity, including cuts in unemployment and welfare benefits.
起初，联合国与许多东帝汶人（包括在去年5月大选中获胜的该国总统、诺贝尔奖得主José Ramos-Horta）一样都希望能够组成一个民族团结政府。	At first, the UN, like many Timorese, including José Ramos-Horta, the country’s Nobel Laureate president who won election last May, had hoped that a national unity government could be formed.
现有实现社会凝聚的政策建立在这一信念基础之上，那就是，市场力量如果不加以调节就会导致巨大的收入差距，从而激化社会冲突。	Existing policies to achieve social cohesion are based on the belief that, if uncorrected, the free play of market forces will lead to wide disparities in income and thus intensify social conflict.
发自北京 — — 从去年十一月以来，经济学家和媒体都都在为供应侧结构改革大唱赞歌，视之为破除中国经济困境的开创性解决方案。	BEIJING – Since last November, economists and the media alike have been hailing supply-side structural reform as a groundbreaking solution to China’s economic woes.
纽约 — — 美国总统唐纳德·特朗普与朝鲜领导人金正恩在新加坡及俄罗斯总统普京在赫尔辛基召开的峰会就像魁北克的七国峰会和布鲁塞尔的北约峰会一样已经成为历史。	NEW YORK – US President Donald Trump’s summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki are history, as is the G7 summit in Quebec and the NATO summit in Brussels.
尽管安全状况持续恶化，2016年6月略超过半数的英国人投票决定退出欧盟 — — 这一决定可能会严重破坏英国与欧洲北约伙伴国的关系。	Despite these deteriorating security conditions, a slim majority of Britons voted in June 2016 to withdraw from the EU – a decision that could fatally undermine the United Kingdom’s relationship with its European NATO partners.
结果巴基斯坦的司法界，媒体和许多公民社会组织如今不仅致力于限制军队，还要制止新政治体制中的掠夺行为。	As a result, Pakistan’s judiciary, media, and many civil-society organizations are now engaged in attempts not only to keep the soldiers in their barracks, but also to constrain the political establishment’s rapacious behavior.
由于许多塑料制品 — — 大部分使用时间很短 — — 来自不可再生资源，当前的塑料使用模式是不可持续的。	Given that a non-renewable resource forms the basis of many plastic products – most of which will not last long – current plastics usage patterns are not sustainable.
在这样的背景下，哈马斯迫使大部分居住在紧邻加沙地区的以色列人逃亡并不令人奇怪，许多以色列人指责政府不能充分保护公民。	Against this background, it is perhaps unsurprising that Hamas managed to compel most Israelis living in areas adjacent to Gaza to flee, with many Israelis accusing their government of failing to protect its citizens adequately.
他还会反对自由贸易、全球化、移民和外国直接投资，同时偏袒国内工人和企业，特别是国有企业和与掌权派关系密切的私营企业和金融集团。	He will also oppose free trade, globalization, immigration, and foreign direct investment, while favoring domestic workers and firms, particularly state-owned enterprises and private business and financial groups with ties to those in power.
在利比亚，我们正在部署新的联合国支持计划，协助该国过渡当局建立符合利比亚人民愿望的新政府和法律秩序。	In Libya, we are deploying a new UN support mission to assist the country’s transitional authorities in establishing a new government and legal order, consistent with the aspirations of the Libyan people.
当然，如果世界上多个国家同时开始财政整合，与此同时，利率已经十分低，且一些最大经济体同处一个货币联盟，那么就不太可能产生有利的结果。	Of course, if many of the world’s economies attempt to consolidate simultaneously, with interest rates already low and some of the largest in a monetary union, such a favorable result is less likely.
但英国也许是最令人震惊的不诚实领导的例子，英国退欧公投及其后果所导致的动荡规模已经超过了平常时间十年。	But perhaps the most striking instance of dishonest leadership has been in the United Kingdom, where the Brexit referendum and its aftermath have caused more instability than Britain experiences in a typical decade.
对于正在追求经济繁荣和社会自由者，以色列可以作为一个样板，因为以色列的成功可以说完全是从一无所有起家的。	Israel can serve as an example to others striving to reach economic prosperity and social freedom, because its success is due to the fact that the country had absolutely nothing at the start.
南非最严重的待解决问题 — — 贫困和社会不平等性 — — 不可能通过与其他金砖国家合作解决，这五个国家名列世界最不平等社会行列。	The country’s most serious remaining problems – poverty and social inequality – are unlikely to be ameliorated through cooperation with the other BRICS countries, all of which rank among the world’s most unequal societies.
自2008年以来，美联储已经增加了超过2万亿美元的基础货币供应，这是前所未有的不可思议的巨额数字，实际上无异于给银行的大礼包，让它们覆盖巨额亏损、刺激借贷和投资。	The US Federal Reserve has added more than $2 trillion to the base money supply since 2008 – an incredible and unprecedented number that is basically a gift to banks intended to cover their deep losses and spur lending and investment.
即便在种植转基因作物的情况下，不科学、过于繁琐的监管程序也显著提高了新作物的生产成本，导致很多潜在的重要品种无法进入市场。	Even where GE crops are being cultivated, unscientific, excessively burdensome regulation has raised the cost of producing new plant varieties significantly, keeping many potentially important ones from the market.
从2008年9月到2014年11月，连续多轮量化宽松令美联储资产负债表膨胀了3.6万亿美元，比同期名义GDP的扩张幅度2.9万亿美元多了近25 % 。	From November 2008 to November 2014, successive QE programs added $3.6 trillion to the Fed’s balance sheet, nearly 25% more than the $2.9 trillion expansion of nominal GDP over the same period.
这样的冷漠源于一种致命的错觉，那就是结核病属于过去 — — 即使2016年有 1，040万人罹患结核病，这样的幻觉依然存在着。	This indifference stems from the deadly delusion that TB is a disease of the past – a delusion that has persisted, even as 10.4 million people contracted TB in 2016.
在其他国家，政策制定者们在多年以前就为银行业现代化制定了路线图并从那时开始就强化了竞争—这对于顾客和银行都是有益的。	In other countries, policymakers set the course for banking modernization years ago and have reinforced competition since then – to the benefit of customers and banks alike.
随着巴黎气候协定距离几个月后生效越走越近 — — 比任何人所预想的都要快 — — 我们仍保持着这一势头。	With the Paris climate agreement on track to enter into force in the coming months – more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible – we still have that momentum.
所以为何欧洲央行推行的大规模量化宽松计划 — — 将足量资金投入流通 — — 未能刺激对商品和服务的需求？	So why has the ECB’s massive quantitative easing (QE) program, which has put plenty of money into circulation, failed to stimulate demand for goods and services?
今时今日，作为全球机构的联合国在裁决政治争端、危机外交，维和以及人道主义行动中扮演着重要的角色，但联合国庞大的规模已成为其履行另外一些职能的重大障碍。	Today, as a universal institution, the UN plays a crucial role in legitimization, crisis diplomacy, peacekeeping, and humanitarian missions, but its very size has proven to be a disadvantage for many other functions.
尽管特朗普非常希望振兴对其竞选获胜发挥重要作用的所谓铁锈地带的钢铁和煤炭部门，但这几乎是不可能的（就像从国外带回大量制造业岗位一样 ） 。	As much as Trump might like to revive steel and coal in the so-called Rust Belt states that were crucial to his electoral victory, that is likely impossible (as is bringing back large numbers of manufacturing jobs from abroad).
类似地，如果我们将与火的斗争定义为战场，我们将建立起军队、研发灭火飞机等强大技术，并将消防员的牺牲视为不可避免。	Likewise, if we define the fight against fire as a battlefield, we will build up our forces, search for more powerful technologies like air tankers, and accept firefighters’ deaths as inevitable.
发自华盛顿特区 — — 欧洲针对其战略挑战的应对 — — 俄罗斯对乌克兰的侵略，逃离暴力冲突的中东难民，失控的北非局势 — — 都让人觉得它的领导人像个无头苍蝇。	WASHINGTON, DC – Europe’s response to the strategic challenges it is facing – Russian aggression in Ukraine, refugees fleeing violence in the Middle East, disorder in North Africa – leaves the impression that its leaders have no idea what to do.
谈论一个行为乖张的美国总统不断扩大的贸易战和其他可能行动似乎与盈利预测的谈论没有密切关系 — — 至少目前还没有。	Talk of an expanding trade war and other possible actions by a volatile US president just does not seem strongly linked to talk of earnings forecasts – at least not yet.
事实上，特朗普的举动突显出美国的伪善，让中国在印度洋-太平洋地区的领土和海洋修正主义上更加肆无忌惮。	In fact, Trump’s behavior has heightened the sense of US hypocrisy, emboldening China further in its territorial and maritime revisionism in the Indo-Pacific region.
此外，与男性拥有的企业相比，女性拥有的企业往往更小，雇员人数更少，更集中于盈利和增长机会有限的行业。	And, compared to businesses owned by men, enterprises owned by women are smaller, employ fewer people, and are more concentrated in sectors with limited opportunities for profit and growth.
因此，欧洲所有国家的中左翼政党已经开始修改路线，其中几个重要国家的社会民主党改变了长期坚持的移民问题态度。	As a result, center-left parties across Europe have begun to change course, with social democrats in several key countries changing long-held positions on migration.
Victor Frankenstein）知道，一旦你创造了一个魔鬼，它就会很快成长起来，摆脱你的控制。	As Dr. Victor Frankenstein discovered, once you create a monster, it can quickly grow and escape your control.
在伊朗之前，美国拒绝轰炸叙利亚（沙特在中东地区的另一大对手 ） ， 还在2011年祝福了前埃及总统穆巴拉克的下台（沙特的重要盟友 ） 。	The falling out over Iran follows America’s refusal to bomb Syria (another Saudi rival in the region) and its blessing of the removal in 2011 of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (an important Saudi ally).
更为重要的是，在合作伙伴的帮助下，拯救马拉维将筹集资金用于农业援助、医疗救护以及对马拉维普通村民进行教育。	More importantly, with other partners, Raising Malawi collects funds for agricultural assistance, medical care, and education for villagers as well.
有分析家怀疑相扑界会把一些最佳位置的门票送给黑帮头子，随着这些比赛在电视上转播，教父会意识到这些信号：相扑界还是向他效忠的。	Some analysts suspect that the Sumo circle has provided some of the best match tickets to Yakuza leaders, who, as matches were shown on television, sent signals to the godfather that they remain loyal to him.
俄罗斯支持叙利亚政府袭击阿勒颇导致和平进程停顿。 叙利亚和平需要依靠全球行动方、地区力量以及正在遭受普京轰炸的温和反对派的合作。	Russia’s support of the Syrian government’s assault on Aleppo has stymied the peace process, which depends on the cooperation of global players, regional powers, and the moderate opposition forces that Putin is bombing.
但是，在大部分情况下，应该认清它们的真面目：它们无非是老掉牙的偏见，旨在将不受欢迎的少数群体排除在社会主流之外。	But, in most cases, they should be recognized for what they are: tired old prejudices meant to exclude an unpopular minority from mainstream society.
“货币政策的力量有限，特别是在利率如此低的情况下 ， ” 有人说 ， “ 我们不能指望适应性货币政策刺激投资组合的调整 ， ” 另一些人说。	"“Monetary policy's power is limited, particularly when the interest rate is so low,"" some said. “We cannot count on accommodative monetary policy to spur a portfolio reshuffling,"" others added."
人们把这一交易视为他信诡秘的腐败及背叛信誓旦旦的民族主义的象征，因而令其道德权威和政治合法性不复存在。 该公司资产包括卫星、移动电话以及航空公司。	The deal was viewed as the epitome of Thaksin’s sophisticated corruption and a betrayal of his proclaimed nationalism, thus exhausting his moral authority and political legitimacy.
但她对金融改革其他实践性细节的了解也不亚于任何人 — — 这部分是因为她曾是问题资产救助计划（TARP）国会监督委员会主席。	But she has also been engaged with all of the other practical details of financial reform for as long as anyone – in part due to her experience as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).
此外，我们必须立法改善仍在工作的所有人的工资和条件，同时用税收提供肯的失业救济、在他所在社区重新为他找一个带薪工作，或为他提供再培训。	In addition, we must legislate to improve the wages and conditions of every human still in employment, while our taxes provide Ken unemployment benefits, a guaranteed paid job in his community, or retraining.
20世纪80年代，第一个合成胰岛素花了不到十年的时间走完了从测试到批准的过程，但单株抗体和基因疗法却用了20多年才抵达了同样的目的地。	While the first recombinant insulin in the 1980’s took less than a decade from testing to approval, monoclonal antibodies and gene therapy took more than 20 years to reach the same milestone.
事实上，它们是危机模式决策活生生的例子，相比于真正的解决办法，更倾向于采取看似令人印象深刻的权宜性措施（更不用说称得上空洞或夸张的豪言壮语 ） 。	In fact, they are examples of crisis-mode policymaking, which tends to favor impressive-seeming stopgap measures (not to mention lofty declarations that can verge on hollowness or hyperbole), instead of real solutions.
但也不能否认这些国家确实成为了发达国家货币政策的受害者，而这些政策在过去30年中令资金流的波动性不断增大。	But there is no denying that these countries have been victims of advanced economies’ monetary policies, which have increased capital-flow volatility over the last three decades.
意大利是人口年龄仅次于德国的最年长的国家，每位15岁以下年轻人对应1.5位65岁以上老人；意大利出生率为每位妇女生育1.35个孩子，也位于世界最低行列，大约和日本相当。	Not only does Italy have the EU’s oldest population after Germany, with 1.5 people over 65 for every one person under 15; its fertility rate, 1.35 children per woman, is also one of the world’s lowest, about on par with Japan.
奥巴马还揿动了对俄关系的“重新设置键 ” ， 并暗示他可能会冻结布什在捷克和波兰部署导弹防御系统的计划。	Obama also pushed the “reset button” with Russia, and suggested that he might freeze Bush’s plan to deploy a missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland.
随自救而发生的政治反响引发了政府和反对党之间，乃至政客和监管者之间的相互指责，而欧盟及其银行监管更是成为众矢之的。	The political backlash that ensued from the bail-in triggered a blame game between the government and the opposition parties, and even between politicians and regulators, with all blaming the European Union and its banking regulations.
因为所有解决方案要么不切实际、不可行要么就是无法接受，多数委内瑞拉人都希望有人能从天而降挽救他们从这场悲剧中摆脱。	With all solutions either impractical, deemed infeasible, or unacceptable, most Venezuelans are wishing for some deus ex machina to save them from this tragedy.
今天，空气中二氧化碳的浓度比工业革命初期提高了近40 % — —根据南极冰盖的钻探记录，毫无疑问已经达到了过去一百万年来的峰值。	Today, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is 40% higher than it was at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution – by far the highest it has been during the past one million years, as we know from drilling into the Antarctic ice.
虽然药品质量测试领域某些解决方案来自像西蒙斯那样的非洲企业家，但其中不少都是在区域外机构支持下进行的零散研发。	While some solutions in the area of drug-quality testing have come from African entrepreneurs like Simmons, such examples are extremely rare, and many are developed in the diaspora with the support of organizations from outside the region.
但这些国家在遥远的丝绸之路年代曾取得过经济和文化领域的非凡成就，现在又再次成了全球竞争的焦点，勾起人们对冷战时期的回忆。	And yet, it is also a region with a distant history of great economic and cultural achievement in the Silk Road era, and that recently has emerged as a focus of renewed global competition reminiscent of the Cold War.
这些行业协会 — — 比如木匠协会、机械工协会、水管工协会等 — — 将储蓄汇集起来，提供提高技能的机会，并形成了一种市场监管形式。	The associations – of carpenters, mechanics, plumbers, and so on – enable pooled savings, provide opportunities to upgrade skills, and create a form of market regulation.
委内瑞拉政府把国家经济和社会搞得一团糟，在他们的领导下，委内瑞拉是全世界产出下降最厉害的国家、通货膨胀率最高的国家，谋杀率第二高的国家，更不用说“无与伦比”的短缺情况了。	Its government has run the country’s economy and society into the ground, overseeing the world’s steepest decline in output, highest inflation rate, and second highest murder rate, not to mention shortages beyond compare.
如果金融公司遵守法定的资本要求 — — 这些要求要求金融公司资本－资产率保持在8%左右 — — 为了追求利润的轻率的资产负债表扩张就会得到抑制。	Reckless balance-sheet expansion in pursuit of profit is kept in check if financial companies adhere to statutory capital requirements, which mandate a capital-asset ratio of about 8%.
如果你在美国加利福尼亚州的圣塔芭芭拉市被判入狱，却又不喜欢跟普通囚犯一样的监狱环境，那么只需支付90美元/天就可以享受升级版的监仓。	If you are sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara, California, and don’t like the standard accommodations, you can buy a prison-cell upgrade for about $90 per night.
但政府对飓风卡特里娜的处理却被很多人称作“国家的耻辱 ” ， 在这样的情况下，质问我们的国家领袖恰恰是民主自身提出的要求。	But asking hard questions of our nation’s leaders is exactly what democracy demands when the government’s response to Hurricane Katrina is widely viewed as “a national disgrace.”
但能够肯定的是，一个社会如何关照老弱病残等弱势群体的问题非常有必要得到人们严肃而周全的讨论，而这些讨论的依据必须是人们的亲眼所见，而不是那些愚昧无知的党派成见。	But surely the way a society cares for its sick and needy and elderly is sufficiently important to deserve serious and thoughtful argument based on what we really can see with our own eyes rather than on uninformed partisan prejudice.
但美国总统特朗普开始兑现承诺，采取保护主义贸易方针 — — 此举可能引起其他国家的报复性措施 — — 这一模式也面临日益严重的压力。	But with US President Donald Trump fulfilling his promise to adopt a more protectionist approach to trade – an effort that could spur retaliatory measures by other countries – that model is coming under increasing strain.
二战后在经济合作与发展组织国家中成功实施的财政巩固政策表明：每1美元的税务上升所带来的效应平均需要5~6美元的支出削减来抵消。	Successful post-World War II fiscal consolidation in OECD countries averaged $5-$6 in spending cuts per $1 of tax hikes.
当美国的储蓄率达到4 % （ 就一般标准来看仍然很低 ） ， 累计总需求就会减弱，随之而来的就是经济走弱。	As America moves to, say, a 4% savings rate (still small by normal standards), aggregate demand will weaken, and with it, the economy.
自然，让以色列强硬派感到遗憾的是，布什政府快走到尽头了，因为他们知道，即使奥巴马总统不大刀阔斧地改变美国对以色列的政策，一旦他上了台，他也不会重复布什政府对以色列无条件地支持的政策。	Hardliners in Israel naturally regret the end of the Bush administration, for they know that, even if President Barack Obama does not dramatically change US policy toward Israel once he assumes power, he will not repeat Bush’s unconditional support.
我们还需要如中国前总理朱镕基这样对全局了如指掌的领袖，不但能告诉我们起点和终点在哪里，还能具体带领我们一步一步向目标迈进。	We need leaders with sufficient mastery of detail, like China’s last premier Zhu Rongji, who can not only tell us how they will get us from A to Z, but can actually lead us from A to B.
即使一点不为斯大林辩护，人们也必须承认苏联对二战盟军胜利的巨大贡献 — — 包括2，600万民众为此献出生命。	Without defending Stalin, one must recognize the immense Soviet contribution – including the lives of 26 million citizens – to the Allied victory in WWII.
这些欧洲人对奥巴马持有保留背后隐含的问题可以概括为 ： “ 我们是否要在阿富汗和其他地方做得更多吗 ？ ”	The implicit question behind some European reservations about Obama may be formulated in one question: “Will we have to do more in Afghanistan and beyond?”
这些人 — — 正如汉娜·阿伦特（Hannah Arendt）曾经观察到的 — — 最终将把犯罪作为他们进入法律世界、融入那些享有法律授予的权利的人的唯一途径。	Such people, as Hannah Arendt once observed, will ultimately come to see in the commission of a crime their only path into the world of law and of those who enjoy the rights the law confers.
类似地，2014年，当西非埃博拉疫情爆发时，拉加德领导IMF用可动用资金为危机中的各国提供债务豁免，这让它们能提高医生和护士待遇 — — 这是IMF首次如此使用自己的资本。	Similarly, when Ebola struck West Africa in 2014, Lagarde directed the IMF to use its available cash to buy debt relief for countries in crisis, which enabled them to pay more doctors and nurses – the first-ever such use of IMF capital.
然而，他仅仅是断章取义地陈列了一些自相矛盾的引文，显示出圣经和教堂的神父的口径并不统一，因此读者必须自己判断。	Yet, he did so by juxtaposing contradictory quotes taken out of context, showing that neither the Bible nor the Church fathers speak in one voice and that readers must decide for themselves.
然而，除了代理政府应当充当怎样的角色这个问题以外，另一个问题是NTC领导人的优柔寡断，他们总是倾向于听从他人。	But, beyond the question of the proper role of custodian governments lies the indecisiveness of the NTC’s leaders, who simply prefer to defer to others.
原教旨主义的伊朗威胁论并不客观地描述中东的实际政治形势，而是被用来继续无条件支持日益风雨飘摇的政权。	Rather than objectively describing the actual political situation in the Middle East, the notion of a fundamental Iranian threat is being used to continue unconditional Western support for increasingly unstable regimes.
风险是AI将继续让我们的社会极化 — — 在拥有者和永远一无所有者之间 — — 如果我们不对其影响进行管理的话。	The risk is that AI will only continue to polarize our societies – between haves and never-will-haves – if we do not manage its effects.
走强硬路线、充当最高领导人喉舌的《世界报 》 （ Kayhan）的最新社论表明，哈梅内伊正在密切关注美国总统大选。	Recent editorials in Kayhan – the hardline Iranian newspaper that serves as a mouthpiece for the Supreme Leader – indicate that Khamenei is looking forward to the US presidential election.
当然，这一过程绝不容易，这不仅是因为中国经济本身十分复杂，也是因为中国经济已经深深融入了全球经济，这意味着它很容易受到外部冲击的影响。	Of course, the process will be far from easy, owing not just to the complexity of China’s economy, but also to its globally integrated nature, which makes it vulnerable to external shocks.
伟大的书、音乐和绘画不仅是非比寻常的真善美学校，也是我们自身真善美的发现之路 — — 它们给我们带来改变潜能，完善我们甚至我们的对话者。	Great books, music, and paintings are not only an extraordinary school of beauty, truth, and good, but also a way of discovering our own beauty, truth, and good – the potential for change, of bettering ourselves and even some of our interlocutors.
只有49%的制造业创业企业和37%的信息产业制造企业能活过四年，但越过了这个门槛的企业都能推出突破性创新。	While only about 49% of manufacturing startups and 37% of information startups survive for four or more years, those that do have managed to produce breakthrough innovations.
事实上，一个全新的捕捉个体用户消极数据并从中挖掘数千亿美金的生意行当已经产生 — — 其中的企业被委婉地称为“数据管理平台 ” 。	Indeed, an entire industry of businesses – which operate rather euphemistically as “data-management platforms” – now captures individual users’ passive data and extracts hundreds of billions of dollars from it.
但2012年，非洲联盟通过了非洲基础设施开发计划，启动了超过400个能源、交通运输、水资源和通讯项目。	But in 2012, the African Union adopted the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa, which kick-started more than 400 energy, transportation, water, and communications projects.
目前为止，抑制公共负债的举措都集中在痛苦的紧缩措施之上，包括对公共产品供应（尤其是医疗教育）的持续削减。	So far, efforts to curb public debt have centered on painful austerity measures, including substantial cuts in the supply of public goods, especially health care and education.
由保守派别控制的最高法院挑选法官和检察官。 而且，该国的体制允许控制司法的地方指挥官为所欲为，阿富汗人在这一体制中基本得不到法律赔偿。	A Supreme Court dominated by conservative factions has selected judges and prosecutors, and Afghans have little legal redress in a system that allows local commanders, who hold sway over the judiciary, to act with impunity.
然而尽管半岛问题似乎放射出希望之光，但随着他自己与金的首脑会晤逐渐临近 ，特朗普很有可能会后悔成为核心人物。	But, despite the rays of hope emanating from the peninsula, Trump may come to regret having taken center stage, especially as his own summit with Kim draws closer.
一项著名的心理学实验发现，能抵挡住不马上吃掉棉花糖的诱惑，进而在未来获得两个棉花糖的小孩，他们长大成人后成功的可能性比经不住诱惑的小孩更大。	A famous psychological experiment found that young children who could resist the immediate temptation to eat a marshmallow, and thereby gain two marshmallows in the future, were likelier to thrive as adults than those who couldn’t.
发自柏林 — — 在未来这几个月，几场严重的区域性经济和政治危机将汇集成一个巨大的分水岭，激起一场全球性的剧变。	BERLIN – In the coming months, several serious regional economic and political crises could combine into one mega-watershed, fueling an intense global upheaval.
伊朗改革派还有可能将政治优势拱手让给强硬派对手，可以预期后者会采取铁腕安保手段，鲁哈尼逐步放松限制的措施将成为牺牲品。	And Iran’s reformers also risk losing political ground to their hardline rivals, who can be expected to adopt an iron-fisted approach to security, at the expense of Rouhani’s gradual loosening of restrictions.
事实上在4月15日，中国军队的一个排趁夜色悄悄越过拉达克地区的边境实际控制线，在深入印度占领区19公里（12英里）的地方安营扎寨。	Indeed, on April 15, a platoon of Chinese troops stealthily crossed the LAC at night in the Ladakh region, establishing a camp 19 kilometers (12 miles) inside Indian-held territory.
2013年11月，美国前财政部长劳伦斯·萨默斯（Lawrence Summers）在国际货币金组织（IMF）的演讲中提到了这个词，随后 ， 《 纽约时报》专栏作家保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）把它推向了热门，此后它就成了一个“毒词 ” 。	After former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers used the term in a November 2013 speech at the International Monetary Fund, the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman picked it up, and it went viral from there.
但是，当买卖双方并非同等地依赖于这一关系时，较少依赖的一方就可以利用更为依赖的一方的脆弱性作为强制力量的一个来源。	However, in cases where buyers and sellers are not equally dependent upon the relationship, the greater vulnerability of the more dependent party can be used as a source of coercive power by the less dependent party.
但多数观察家似乎认为他的支持为乌马拉披上了民主合法的外衣，后者在2007年公然登上了亲查韦斯的舞台。	But most observers seem to believe that his support was crucial in bestowing a mantle of legitimacy and democratic disposition on Humala, who in 2007 ran on an unabashedly pro-Hugo Chávez platform.
其他值得注意的难民来源国包括厄立特里亚（12 % ） 、索马里（5 % ） 和伊拉克（3 % ） 。	Other notable contributors include Eritrea (12%), Somalia (5%), and Iraq (3%).
如果受援国就该援助签署财政协议，而且援助国在提供援助时也提供技术支持以增强其统治能力，那么金融市场将更易被折服。	Financial markets would be more easily convinced if such support were complemented by the recipient countries’ acceptance of the fiscal pact, together with technical help to strengthen their governance.
发自纽约 — — 中国经济增长模式所产生的问题在近期广受关注，而中国股市最近的直线下跌使它们成为了更为尖锐的焦点问题。	NEW YORK – The problems with China’s economic-growth pattern have become well known in recent years, with the Chinese stock-market’s recent free-fall bringing them into sharper focus.
其���，没有什么历史记录表明，贫穷国家只有在先进经济体采取极低或者无壁垒的情况下才能从全球化中受益。	Second, there is nothing in the historical record to suggest that poor countries require very low or zero barriers in the advanced economies in order to benefit greatly from globalization.
学校教育每增加一年， 就读者的收入平均增长10 % ， 进而改善他们长期的财务稳定性，并有助于降低回归暴力的风险。	Each year of additional schooling increases a learner’s earnings by 10%, on average, improving their long-term financial stability, and helping to lower the risk of a return to violence.
人们对这种糟糕的表现也是解释众多。 一些人认为欧元区是一个不完全的货币联盟，导致德国这样的“核心”国家不断从像意大利这类“外围”国家抽取劳动力和资本。	Some would explain this poor performance by arguing that the eurozone is an incomplete monetary union, and that its “core” countries like Germany drain labor and capital from “periphery” countries like Italy.
他们的网购第一的购物习惯、对旅游和新体验的开放态度以及不断提升的购买力表明，他们所购买的产品和服务将影响全世界的消费市场，助推全球经济增长。	Their mobile-first shopping habits, openness to travel and new experiences, and rising purchasing power suggest that the products and services they buy will influence consumer markets worldwide, fueling global economic growth.
并且，如果像许多人预期的那样，保守的议员击败了因与布什联合而受害的在职的共和党议员，那么在今年11月份之后，国会中的民主党人会更分裂。	And Democrats in Congress will be even more divided after November if, as many expect, conservative members defeat Republican incumbents damaged by their association with Bush.
媒体捕获在很大程度上也是如此，政治领导人要么完全拥有媒体（如意大利的贝卢斯科尼 ） ， 要么能够通过裙带关系或惩罚来保证媒体领导人忠于自己。	Media capture works in much the same way, with political leaders either owning media outlets outright (think of Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi) or ensuring that media leaders are loyal to them, whether through cronyism or punishment.
但还有另一种更具说服力的观点：虽然经济停滞可以助推选民进入民粹主义阵营，但经济形势低迷不是政治混乱的必要和充分条件。	Yet there is an alternative – and more persuasive – view: while economic stagnation helps push upset voters into the populist camp, bad economics is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for bad politics.
我们还必需与所有有关国家讨论确保增强金融稳定以及避免未来动乱的方案。 这也是四月份召开的二十国集团高峰会议的主题。	We must also ensure that solutions for strengthening financial stability and avoiding future turmoil – the focus of April’s G-20 summit – are discussed with all countries concerned.
但作为欧洲民主国家对卢卡申科全部独裁行为（其驯服的法庭、野蛮的监狱和腐败的警察）所做出的回应，这样微弱的力量还远远不够。	This meager effort, however, is an insufficient response by Europe’s democracies to the full panoply of Lukashenka’s dictatorship: his docile courts, brutal jails, and corrupt police.
英国的研究发现，哪怕是知道抗药性如何发展的人，也常常会在没有处方的情况下服用抗生素或把自己的药给家庭成员，从而加剧了抗药性问题。	Research in the United Kingdom has found that even people who understand how resistance develops often contribute to the problem by taking antibiotics without a prescription or giving their drugs to members of their family.
如果欧洲危机导致中国的全年GDP增长低于7 ％ 、 印度低于5 % 、 巴西低于3 % ， 这些新兴国家最弱势的民众将会受到最沉重的打击。	If the crisis in Europe were to cause annual GDP growth to fall below 7% in China, 5% in India, and 3% in Brazil, these countries’ most vulnerable citizens would be hardest hit.
金融行动专责委员会（Financial Action Task Force）看起来动力十足，好像是随时随地可以派往受困国的快速反应部队似的。	The Financial Action Task Force sounds dynamic, like a rapid-response team one might send to a troubled country.
对家庭收入状况的援助应该双线推进：一方面是业已成熟的现金转移支付，另一方面是目前远远落后于需求的基本就业保证。	Household income support should run on twin tracks: cash transfers, already well-established, and basic employment assurance, which lags well behind needs.
这能给所有人带来更加美好的未来，公民有更多的机会获得成人教育，拥有更多的自由时间追求个人兴趣，并大大延长健康岁月的生产率和就业时间。	This can lead to a better future for all, with citizens gaining better access to adult education, having more free time to pursue personal interests, and remaining productive and occupationally engaged far longer into their healthy lives.
报告指出，自《京都议定书》签订18年以来，通过这份协议的运作模式来寻求达成国际气候政策的举措并没有成功实现任何实质性的温室气体减排。	The authors note that 18 years of the “Kyoto Protocol approach” to international climate policy have failed to produce any discernable real-world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases.
但深度改革遇到了常见的障碍 — — 对应该怎么做产生了分歧，法国新总统马克龙曾经将这一分歧称为德国和法国精英之间的“神圣战争 ” 。	Yet serious reform was impeded by the usual disagreement about what should be done – a dispute that Emmanuel Macron, France’s new president, once described as a “holy war” between German and French elites.
（除普遍认为与政府结盟的埃及和叙利亚基督教少数派以外 ， ） 与犹太人或者基督徒的战争显然已经退居二线。	War with Jews or Christians has necessarily taken a back seat (except where, as in Egypt and Syria, Christian minorities are perceived to be allied with the regime).
特朗普政府需要放下自满，追求竞争性的联盟构建（competitive coalition-building ） 。	The Trump administration needs to abandon its complacency and pursue competitive coalition-building.
2003年底在纪念伟大领袖110周年诞辰的讲话上，他宣称毛泽东是一位“伟大的无产阶级革命战略家和理论家 ” 。	In a speech marking the Great Helmsman’s 110th birthday in late 2003, he declared Mao to be a “great proletariat revolutionary strategist and theorist.”
而后他应当公布在今后一段时期内逐步引入上述变化所需要的预算，并告诉人们与巨大的收益相比耗费的成本并不算高。	He could then present an estimated price tag for phasing in these changes over time, and demonstrate that the costs would be modest compared to the enormous benefits.
令人难过的是，全球变暖还会使这次海啸受灾国中的一部分遭到损害，像马尔代夫这样地势低洼的岛国将会被淹没。	Sadly, global warming will likely destroy some of the same countries ravaged by the tsunami. Low lying islands like the Maldives will become submerged.
在美国，收入增加、人口老化以及延续生命和提高生命质量的新技术在几十年中让医疗费用上升超过总体收入3.5 % 。	Rising incomes, population aging, and new technologies for extending and enhancing life, have caused health costs to rise 3.5% faster than overall income for many decades now in the United States.
越南对华双边贸易不断扩大，有望在今年突破1,000亿美元，而其对美贸易关系因为美国向内转政策而受到影响。	While Vietnam’s bilateral trade with China is expanding and could exceed $100 billion sometime this year, its trading relationship with the US is being hurt by America’s inward turn.
但伊朗领导人对其他可能仍持怀疑态度，尽管美国的官方立场是将“动用台面上的一切选择”来防止伊朗发展核武器。	But Iran’s leaders remain skeptical of either scenario, despite America’s official position that “all options are on the table” to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability.
如果地产价格急剧下降，就会发生连锁反应，大小投资者同样受困，一段时间过后还会给许多普通非洲民众带来痛苦。	If real estate prices were to fall dramatically, a chain reaction could occur, taking down big and small investors alike, and over time causing wide suffering to ordinary Africans.
日内瓦—刚刚实施的可持续发展目标（SDG）预示着全球发展新时代的开始，这个时代有望以人民、地球、繁荣、和平和合作的名义改变世界。	GENEVA – The just-adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are expected to herald the start of a new era in global development, one that promises to transform the world in the name of people, the planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership.
超级球星的卓越表现或许是出色 — — 甚至鼓舞人心的 — — 正如救援机制和经济刺激方案能凝聚市场、提升人们的期望值。	An exceptional performance by a superstar soccer player can be beautiful – even inspiring – just as rescue mechanisms and stimulus packages can rally markets and raise hopes.
令人担忧的是无论是日本的后续行动还是受影响国家的国内现实都无法保证放弃市场份额的风险是值得的，尤其是在全球经济整体 — — 和全球政策协调 — — 都陷入困境的时期。	The fear is that neither Japan’s subsequent actions nor the affected countries’ domestic realities will justify the risk of lost market share, especially at a time when the global economy as a whole – and global policy coordination – is struggling.
因此，制度改革必须超越巴西央行不充分的价格稳定目标 — — 该目标基于不能反映普通巴西消费者体验的狭义通胀指数制定。	Institutional reform must therefore move beyond the BCB’s inadequate price-stability target, which is set according to a narrow inflation index that fails to reflect the experiences of ordinary Brazilian consumers.
而香港的民众则极可能认为他们别无选择只能用一切手段抗议特首董建华领导下的不受欢迎的政府，从而使其执政变得更为困难。	Hong Kong's people may well conclude that they have no alternative but to use every occasion to protest chief executive Tung Chee-hwa's unpopular government, making it even harder for him to govern.
我们知道，如果没有亲力亲为地直接参与和坚持不屑，就不可能100%摧毁叙利亚宣称拥有的化学武器，正如没有这些努力，叙利亚令人骇人听闻的邪恶内战是不会结束的。	We know that the destruction of 100% of Syria’s declared chemical weapons would not have happened without direct, hands-on diplomacy and perseverance, just as Syria’s immoral and horrifying civil war will not end without an equal commitment.
由阿富汗和国际社会共同组成的选举监督委员会中大部分委员由联合国任命 — — 在选举过程中保持一定的威信。	One institution, the Electoral Complaints Commission—a hybrid Afghan-international oversight body with a majority vote controlled by United Nations-appointed commissioners—retained its credibility throughout the process.
如此之多的非洲人宁愿冒险葬身地中海、生活在北非可怕的拘留中心或者露宿欧洲城市公园，也不愿留在非洲就很能说明问题。	It is telling that so many Africans are willing to risk drowning in the Mediterranean Sea, living in appalling detention centers in North Africa, or sleeping in public parks in European cities, rather than remaining in Africa.
比如，三星公司一开始是一家贸易公司，接着转型为食品处理、纺织、保险和零售商，后来又转变成电子、造船、工程、建筑和航天公司（这里提到的只是其活动的一小部分 ） 。	For example, Samsung started as a trading company, moved to food processing, textiles, insurance, and retail, and then on to electronics, shipbuilding, engineering, construction, and aerospace, just to name a few activities.
伊朗希望知道，作为伊朗当下和未来的让步的交换，哪几项制裁会被推迟、冻结或取消。 他们担心，美国会在人权、安全和其他领域继续对伊朗实施制裁。	Iran wants to know which sanctions might be delayed, frozen, or lifted in exchange for current and future concessions, fearing that the US will continue to impose sanctions on human-rights, security, or other grounds.
事实上，这样的担心早在2013年秋天就已经广为流传，当时我还在伊斯坦布尔为一档BBC以新兴经济体为主题的系列广播节目采访商界及金融领导人。	In fact, such worries were widespread as far back as the fall of 2013, when I was in Istanbul interviewing business and financial leaders for a BBC Radio series on emerging economies.
在过去十年中，印度人民党培养了一支网络义勇军传播其印度教沙文主义、蔑视少数民族和极端民族主义的信念。	Over the last decade, the BJP has cultivated an army of cyber warriors to propagate its message of Hindu chauvinism, contempt for minorities, and hyper-nationalism, including through ferocious attacks on political opponents.
相反，中共坚持认为政府是软实力的主要来源，推广其认为具有全球吸引力的古代文化形象 — — 通常是通过宣传工具进行。	Instead, it has clung to the view that the government is the main source of soft power, promoting ancient cultural icons that it thinks might have global appeal, often using the tools of propaganda.
在这些统计数字的鼓励下，全球权利活动家要求各国更改堕胎法，2000年以来，已有30多个国家放松了堕胎政策。	Buoyed by these statistics, rights activists around the world are demanding changes to national abortion laws, and since 2000, more than 30 countries have liberalized their approach.
其实，敏锐的朝鲜问题观察家指出金正恩希望在仍然拥有冷酷而经验丰富的金敬姬支持的情况下，通过下令发射导弹来巩固自己对权力的掌控。	Indeed, keen observers of North Korea suggest that Kim Jong-un ordered the missile launch as a way to strengthen his grip on power while he still has the experienced and ruthless Kim Kyong-hui’s backing.
他们还希望有高效的政府治理、推动发展的经济改革、惩办那些出卖国家利益者，民主权利以及信仰（或不信仰）宗教的自由 — — 简而言之，就是一场全面的社会转型。	They also seek efficient governance, economic reforms to stimulate growth, the ouster of collaborators, democratic rights, freedom of religion (and perhaps also from religion) – in short, a comprehensive social transformation.
其中最糟糕的指责要数对那些犯有针对本国人民的大规模暴行的人立场软弱 — — 比如埃及目前的军事统治者。	And worst of all is to be perceived as being soft on those who, like Egypt’s current military rulers, commit mass-atrocity crimes against their own citizens.
任何这样的试验结果都无从预测，因为其他国家的经验从来都不可能是另一个新体系的完美向导 — — 不同环境其形势也决不会相同。	The outcome of any such experiment is impossible to foresee, because other countries’ experience can never be a perfect guide to a new system – the situation is never exactly the same in a different environment.
美国人强制执行并引发不和的宪法进程不仅没有为新上台的政治家留出妥协的时间，反而加剧了现有分裂，从而导致2006-2007年内战爆发。	Rather than giving these new politicians time to broker compromises, the Americans imposed a divisive constitutional process that exacerbated existing fissures, leading to the civil war of 2006-2007.
但最近的委内瑞拉难民海啸给哥伦比亚造成了巨大的问题，这些问题已不再局限于管制、确保紧急医护和提供其他服务等直接成本。	But the recent tsunami of Venezuelan refugees is causing massive problems for Colombia, beyond the direct costs of policing, ensuring urgent medical care, and providing other services.
无论如何，当发达国家只接收少量技术移民时，他们其实未采取任何措施来减轻促使移民流动的压力，而多数流动的移民并不掌握新国家所需的技术。	In any case, when advanced countries accept only a small number of skilled migrants, they do nothing to diminish the pressure that drives migration flows, which overwhelmingly comprise people who lack the new country’s required skills.
这项政策应该通过使市场利率与预期利润率保持一致起作用，其思想根源来自瑞典经济学家维克赛尔（Knut Wicksell ） 。	The policy is supposed to work by aligning the market rate of interest with the expected rate of profit, an idea derived from the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.
而习近平需要判断他可以做出什么让步，即让美国来访者感到满意，又不会有损于他和中共在中国人民心目中的形象。	And Xi will have to judge what he can give to satisfy his American visitor without jeopardizing his or the Party’s standing in the eyes of the Chinese people.
而我们成功推销的原因并不是因为自己是什么天才人物，是因为我们从所有希望看到波斯尼亚惨剧终结的国家处获得了极大的支持。	We didn’t succeed because we were geniuses. We succeeded because we had tremendous support from every country that wanted to see the horrific conflict in Bosnia brought to an end.
怀德斯在Tweeter上留言说 ： “ 那个侮辱反伊斯兰斗争的精神患者简直令人作呕，也对全球反伊斯兰运动造成了重大打击 ” 。	Wilders tweeted: “That a psychopath has abused the battle against Islamization is disgusting and a slap in the face of the worldwide anti-Islam movement.”
法国开发署（French Development Agency，AFD，由我担任CEO）等开发银行可以做出贡献。	Development banks like the French Development Agency (AFD), where I am CEO, are well placed to contribute.
尽管沙特皇室不愿改革，但面对来自国内、邻国和世界的多重压力，他们不得不让步，当然变革的程度还仅停留在表层，有待加深。	Despite its reluctance to change, the Saudi royal family is obviously yielding to these multiple pressures from within, from neighbors, and from the wider world, although the extent of change is still nominal and obviously leaves much to be desired.
五家最大的公司控制了65%的市场，约翰迪尔（John Deere）商标所有人迪尔公司在这方面一马当先。	The five largest corporations account for 65% of the market, with Deere & Company, the owner of the John Deere brand, in the lead.
在最近的几个月里，杜泽在与一些卓越的无神论者辩论的时候有力的阐述了自己的观点，但是他也对为我上面列出的问题找一个令人信服的答案感到吃力。	In recent months, D’Souza has made a point of debating prominent atheists, but he, too, struggled to find a convincing answer to the problem I outlined above.
为遏制愈演愈烈的针对“欧洲”的批评，欧盟不仅需要少数政治代表的参与，还需要民间社团参与开放辩论的突变情节。	To stem mounting criticism of “Europe,” the EU needs the coup de théâtre of an open debate involving civil society, not just a handful of political representatives.
而正是这个多元化的团体使得一个正日益显现的全球性共识明晰起来。 这便是：虽然全球化有着积极的潜力，但它并没有发挥出这种潜力，还造成了社会的困境。	Yet this very heterogeneous group was able to crystallize the emerging global consensus that globalization, despite its positive potential, has not only failed to live up to that potential, but has actually contributed to social distress.
但是，你无法摆脱一种不安感，即，当一切都说到做尽时，最新的科技创新对长期生活水平增长的贡献可能远远不如拥趸所宣称的。	Still, one cannot avoid the uneasy feeling that, when all is said and done, the contribution of recent technological innovations to long-term growth in living standards may be substantially less than the enthusiasts claim.
幸运的是，现在情况已经发生了改变，占温室气体排放量80%的110个国家 — — 包括印度、中国和巴西 — — 已经同意支持哥本哈根协议。	Fortunately, though, things have changed since then, with the 110 countries responsible for 80% of greenhouse-gas emissions – including India, China, and Brazil – now giving their support to the Copenhagen agreement.
5月22日，参议院以微弱多数 — — 51比48 — — 避免了这一障碍成为现实 — — 在授予奥巴马所谓的“快车道”TPP谈判权的立法中不加入“货币操纵”修正条款。	On May 22, the Senate avoided it, by narrowly defeating – 51 to 48 – a proposed “currency manipulation” amendment to a bill that gives Obama so-called “fast-track” authority to negotiate the TPP.
美国被视为众多地区病背后的罪魁，但却被指责参与得不够，只会“在幕后领导 ” ， 没有支持民主，抛弃了自己的朋友，如此等等。	The United States is seen as the culprit behind many of the regions ills, and yet it is accused of not being sufficiently engaged, of “leading from behind,” of failing to support democracy, of abandoning its friends, and so on.
但最近默克尔在德国总理官邸梅瑟堡（Meseberg）与马克龙举行峰会时同意了超乎所有人意料的宏大改革。	Yet during a recent summit with Macron at the German chancellor’s residence in Meseberg, Merkel agreed to far more ambitious reforms than anyone expected.
这就解释了埃尔多安对去年夏天格齐公园（Gezi Park）反对者的指控。 他们示威表达对埃尔多安建设购物中心的计划，被埃尔多安称为不配做土耳其人。	This explains Erdoğan’s accusation that the protesters in Gezi Park last summer, who demonstrated against his government’s plans to erect a shopping center, were not proper Turks at all.
当增长大幅降速时，TFP下降得更快 — — 这一戏剧性变化显然与1971年日元升值和1973年石油危机有关。	When growth plummeted, TFP fell even faster – a dramatic change that was clearly linked to the 1971 yen appreciation and the 1973 oil crisis.
事实上，在拉托发出辞职公告前，国际货币基金组织宣布有权谴责那些实施可能对全球经济稳定造成破坏的干预政策的国家。	Indeed, a week before Rato’s resignation announcement, the Fund asserted that it had the right to censure countries whose intervention policies threaten to undermine global economic stability.
事实上，增速放缓的其中一部分原因可以归结为测量方法的问题：在欧洲还有美国，智能手机和互联网所引发的科技变革根本没有体现在生产率数据上。	In fact, part of the perceived slowdown can be attributed to measurement issues: In Europe, as well as the United States, the technological changes being wrought by smartphones and the Internet simply are not showing up in the productivity data.
比如，美国和欧洲均已和许多拉丁美洲国家签订了自由贸易条约，这意味着可以建立一个地理范围极广的自由贸易区，从而增强抵御全球危机的韧性。	For example, both have already signed free-trade treaties with various Latin American countries, implying the creation of a geographically enormous free-trade area, which should boost economic resilience in the face of global crisis.
特朗普一心只关注三个问题 — — 贸易、朝鲜和伊朗 — — 对于中国通过在新拓土地上疯狂建设永久设施来构建军事资产只是默默旁观。	Focused obsessively on three issues – trade, North Korea, and Iran – Trump has watched quietly as China builds up its military assets through frenzied construction of permanent facilities on newly reclaimed land.
进步变化研究所（Progressive Change Institute）正在运作“大观点工程 ” （ The Big Ideas Project ） ， 人们投票选择他们所认为的最重要的政策议案。	The Progressive Change Institute is currently running “The Big Ideas Project,” whereby people can vote on what they regard as the most important policy proposals.
但一些微妙的问题 — — 比如“氯化鸡 ” （ 欧洲怀疑美国鸡肉进入市场前都用氯消毒）和投资者纠纷和解等问题 — — 仍主导着争论。	Yet trivial issues – for example, the use of chlorinated chicken and settlements of investor disputes – continue to dominate the debate.
如果世界经济的很大一部分希望保持国际收支经常项目顺差（到2006年，这部分经济体包括亚洲新兴市场很大一部分、大多数石油输出国和日本 ） ， 那么世界经济相等的一部分就必然要面临赤字。	If a considerable fraction of the world economy wants to run a current-account surplus (by 2006, this included much of emerging Asia, most oil exporters, and Japan), an equal share of the world economy must run a deficit.
它的民主外衣都被愤世疾俗的政治笑话所剥光，它那些带领国家加入欧盟的承诺沦为空话，而那些损公肥私者的贪婪性也暴露无疑。	Its democratic posturing has been unmasked as cynical political theater, its claim to desire a European future for Ukraine’s people revealed to be a lie, and the rapaciousness of its kleptocrats has been laid bare.
在他的十年当政期间，布莱尔和他的财政大臣布朗给了英国历时最长的经济稳定、相对高增长以及低失业率的时期之一。	During his ten years in power, Blair and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, gave Britain one of the longest periods of economic stability, relatively high growth, and low unemployment that it had ever known.
幸运的是，南非宪法法院已经裁定死刑不合乎宪法，这种刑罚在南非人民从种族隔离制度下解放出来的同时即被宣告废止。	Mercifully, South Africa’s Constitutional Court has ruled that the death penalty – which South Africans eliminated at the same time we were liberated from apartheid – is unconstitutional.
在巴勒斯坦问题上没有取得确实进展之前，温和的阿拉伯国家政权不会敢于同以色列开展公开和认真的建立友好关系的进程。	Moderate Arab regimes will not dare to engage in an open and serious process of rapprochement with Israel in the absence of real progress over the Palestinian issue.
习近平最近在访问开罗时指出 ， “ 我们在中东不找代理人，而是劝和促谈；不搞势力范围，而是推动大家一起加入‘一带一路’朋友圈 。 ”	As Xi put it on his recent visit to Cairo: “Instead of looking for a proxy in the Middle East, we promote peace talks; instead of seeking any sphere of influence, we call on all parties to join the circle of friends for the Belt and Road initiative.”
所有这些都是众所周知的；现在所需要的是实施这些改革的意愿以及监督和问责以确保官僚体系能迅速有效地采取改革的机制。	All of this is well known; what is needed now is the will to undertake such reforms and a mechanism for oversight and accountability to ensure that the bureaucracy implements them quickly and effectively.
这要求建立一个代表所有相关势力的共同平台，包括地方协调委员会（Local Coordination Committees ） 、 叙利亚革命协调联盟（Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union）以及自由叙利亚军（Free Syrian Army）军事委员会。	This entails forming a common platform that represents all relevant groups, including the Local Coordination Committees, the Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union, and the Free Syrian Army’s military councils.
但这也衍生出另一种更有害的观念：既然阿罗-德布鲁模型之外的思考变得更现实也因此更为复杂，那就不适用于课堂教学。	But it has become burdened with another, more pernicious notion: as departures from the Arrow-Debreu model become more realistic, and thus more complex, they become less suitable for the classroom.
确保这些信息能够轻松在线获取对鼓励那些职务风险最大的员工充分利用所面临的培训选项会起到至关重要的作用。	Making such information easily available online is crucial to encourage workers whose jobs are most at risk to explore their training options.
与此同时，斯卡伯勒礁的对峙也已经渐趋平静，而且虽然日本在独岛事件后召回了驻韩国大使，但两国开战的可能性不大。	Meanwhile, the standoff over the Scarborough Shoal has calmed down, and, while Japan recalled its ambassador from South Korea over the Dokdo incident, it is unlikely the two countries would come to blows.
尽管他对所有的后果没有考虑周全，也没有解决所有对你的理论不利的观点，但是他在你的主要观点上却捷足先登。	He’s scooped you on your main idea, although he hasn’t thought through the implications, or worked out all the other ideas that comprise your theory.
实际上，这也是为什么一个美国的交易所可以为欧洲通胀期货提供市场。 有了新的信息技术，人们居住在何处无关紧要。	Indeed, this is also why an American exchange can make a market for European inflation; with new information technology, it no longer matters where people live.
提供普遍的互联网接入是一项规模堪与人类基因组测序相媲美的工程；此外，与人类基因组工程类似，它将带来新的风险和伦理问题。	Providing universal Internet access is a project on a scale similar to sequencing the human genome, and, like the human-genome project, it will raise new risks and sensitive ethical issues.
在从不以“丑角政客”闻名的荷兰，皮姆·杜恩是民粹主义崛起早期的领导人物，杜恩是位张扬的同性恋，他在公共场合露面总是既有挑衅性又极富娱乐效果。	In the Netherlands, not normally a country known for clownish politicians, the surge of populism was first led by Pim Fortuyn, a flamboyantly gay man who staged provocative, and always richly entertaining, public appearances.
我们相信格鲁吉亚应该勇敢追求自身的利益，这些利益也许与欧洲、俄国或美国所共有，但即便如此仍要坚持从我们自身出发。	We believe that Georgia should pursue its own interests, which it may share with Europe, Russia, or the US, but which are nonetheless our own.
同样，为控制汽车排放污染，中国政府已经把电动车作为重中之重，并制定了到2020年达到上路500万辆的目标。	Likewise, to rein in pollutants from motor vehicles, China’s government has made adoption of electric vehicles a high priority, setting a target of five million on the country’s roads by 2020.
这一观念可以追溯到1630年，那一年，马萨诸塞湾殖民地首任总督约翰·温斯罗普（John Winthrop）宣布他的社区将像一座“山巅之城 ” （ city upon a hill ） ， 为全世界树立一个榜样。	"The idea extends as far back as 1630, when John Winthrop, the Massachusetts Bay Colony's first governor, declared that his community must act as a “city upon a hill,"" setting an example for the world."
以12月的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议为例。 会议对提高联邦基金利率的讨论充斥着形容词而不是明白无误的行动。	Consider the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where discussions of raising the benchmark federal funds rate were couched in adjectives, rather than explicit actions.
最后，还需要新的贸易契约 — — 可能（但不一定）在多哈回合中形成 — — 以确保主要贸易大国能够进入外国市场。	Finally, a new trade pact – possibly, but not necessarily, within the Doha Round – is needed to ensure the major trading powers’ access to foreign markets.
不论这场动乱是否会最终实现普希金的预言，都将撕裂俄罗斯 — — 并将今天的未来沙皇抛入历史的垃圾桶。	Whether or not that upheaval finally fulfills Pushkin’s prophecy, it would tear Russia apart – and most likely drive today’s would-be czar into the dustbin of history.
为了将《议定书》付诸实施而付出的巨大努力表明要达成预定将于2009年12月通过的下一份协定还将需要付出多少艰辛的工作。	The enormous effort expended to bring the Protocol into force nonetheless indicates how much work will be required to produce the next treaty, due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December 2009.
由于没有立足社区的解决办法，同执法机关的交往也就局限于紧张的、充满冲突的情况，进而加剧了反叛的年轻人和警察之间的对抗性气氛。	In the absence of a community-based approach, interactions with law-enforcement authorities are now limited to tense, conflict-ridden situations, reinforcing the confrontational atmosphere between rebellious youth and the police.
但实现这项新技术潜力的最大化需要稳定而可预测的经营环境，以及对基础研究的支持，而这些条件只有政府才能提供。	But maximizing the potential of the new technology requires the stable and predictable operating environment, as well as the support for basic research, that only governments can provide.
冰盖消融导致阳光反射能力减弱，新增的大片海洋面积吸纳更多热量并释放进大气层，进而对北半球的风力和气压造成影响。	Less ice reflects less sunlight, and more open ocean absorbs more heat, which is then released into the atmosphere, affecting wind and pressure patterns throughout the northern hemisphere.
因此，关系到心理疾病的公共政策必须仔细考虑可能会以诊断分类的名义出现、强加于人们身上的不公平的社会及政治价值观。	Public policy concerning mental illness must, therefore, consider carefully the potential for imposing unjustified social and political values on people in the guise of the classification of disease.
正如我和乔治·舒尔茨（George P. Shultz ） 、 威廉·佩里（William J. Perry ） 、 亨利·基辛格、山姆·那恩（Sam Nunn）等人五年前所指出的，随着有核国家数量的增加，核威慑变得越来越不可靠、越来越危险。	As I, along with George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger, Sam Nunn, and others, pointed out five years ago, nuclear deterrence becomes less reliable and more risky as the number of nuclear-armed states increases.
如今，即便是铁杆留欧派也没有提出保留英国和欧盟之间的双向劳动力流动以及加入欧洲经济区（EEA ） 。	Now, even committed Remainers are failing to make the case for continued two-way labor mobility between the UK and the EU, and for membership in the European Economic Area (EEA).
在花费了八年时间与数十亿美元之后，巴基斯坦塔利班势力反而夺取了对斯瓦特地区的控制权，对毗邻的布纳地区形成了恐怖威慑，并在该国其余各地敲响了警钟、唤起了人们的惊恐。	Eight years and many billions of dollars later, the Pakistani Taliban seized control of the Swat region, terrorizing the adjoining district of Buner and raising alarm and consternation through the rest of Pakistan.
以美国为首的委婉公关闪电战已经开始，美国助理贸易代表卡特勒将最新优惠贸易协定（泛太平洋伙伴关系协定）称之为“高标准”的协议。	The US-led public-relations blitzkrieg of euphemism has already begun, with US Assistant Trade Representative Wendy Cutler describing the latest PTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as a “high standard” agreement.
对于意大利而言，在几乎将意大利超级足球联赛毁于一旦的腐败丑闻之后，意大利国家队不得不在同胞们的心目中为这一运动平反。	In the Italian case, following the corruption scandals that have nearly sunk Il Calcio, Italy’s premier football league, the national team had to rehabilitate the game in the eyes of their fellow citizens.
这一趋势应该扩大到IT服务、医疗、国内交通、酒店和休闲等行业，未来十年服务业总体占GDP之比应增加到60—65 % 。	It should broaden into IT services, healthcare, domestic transportation, and hospitality and leisure, as the sector as a whole climbs toward a 60-65% share of GDP over the next decade.
艾滋病治疗、包括ART的普及，也是急需重视的因素，因为缩小艾滋病的影响范围可以在很大程度上减轻治疗结核病的长期负担。	Moreover, the capacity for prompt, accurate laboratory-based diagnosis of TB and drug resistance must be strengthened.
为了知道原因，假设每处死一名杀人犯（而不是终身监禁 ） ， 杀人犯的数量减少三个，这个数字大大低于尔里奇和其他某些人所估计的震慑力。	To see why, suppose that for each murderer executed (instead of, say, receiving life imprisonment), the number of murders is reduced by three, which is a much lower number than Ehrlich’s and some other estimates of the deterrent effect.
而在21世纪第一个十年，这一数字继续下降至每年大约55,000人 — — 比此前100年中的任何一个十年都要低，相当于“平均武装冲突”每年只有略多于1,000。	And in the first decade of this century, it fell still more, to around 55,000 a year – the lowest rate in any decade in the previous 100 years and equivalent to just over 1,000 a year for the “average armed conflict.”
土壤和天气“大数据”的聚合、新农业技术、转基因种子和农化新发展趋势将帮助这些公司节省成本、保护自然资源、实现全球作物收成最大化。	The confluence of soil and weather “big data,” new agrotechnologies, genetically modified seeds, and new developments in agrochemistry will help these companies save money, protect natural resources, and maximize crop yields worldwide.
实际上，欧洲国家的宗教背景清楚地反映在有关这种研究的不同的欧洲国家的法律之中。 英国和瑞典最为开明，而意大利、奥地利和波兰最为限制。	Indeed, the religious background of Europe’s nations clearly manifested itself in various European laws on such research, with the United Kingdom and Sweden being the most liberal and Italy, Austria, and Poland the most restrictive.
诚然，历史告诉我们没有什么承诺是不可逆的：a野村证券的延斯·诺德维格（Jens Nordvig）指出，自十九世纪以来，已经发生过67次货币联盟解体事件。	True, history teaches that no commitment is irrevocable: according to Jens Nordvig of Nomura Securities, there have been 67 currency-union breakups since the beginning of the nineteenth century.
“我们办理的所有在押人员案件都必须服从于一个保护令 ， ” 迪克松说 ， “ 在这个保护令之下，囚犯所说的每一句话都是机密 ” ， 除非国防部“特权小组”另有决定。	“We are subject in all detainee cases to a protective order,” Dixon says. “Under this order, everything the detainee says is classified,” unless the Department of Defense “Privilege Team” decides otherwise.
断断续续的可怜的降水导致250万人面临持续粮食危机；大约400,000儿童出于严重营养不良状态；粮食价格节节攀升；干枯的水井让社区不得不依靠昂贵的运水车。	Poor and erratic rains have left 2.5 million people facing an ongoing food crisis; some 400,000 children live with acute malnutrition; food prices are rising; and dry wells have left communities dependent on expensive trucked water.
但那些金融冒险家们肯定有无数借口继续冒险，因为他们知道就算局面最终无法收拾，还是有人会出手拯救他们。	But risk takers have every incentive to try their luck again, knowing that, at worst, they will be bailed out.
该国目前面临着严重的能源紧缺，经济自1990年以来一直陷入萧条，人均收入估计只有1800美元，仅仅相当于韩国的5 % 。	The country is facing severe energy constraints, and its economy has been stagnating since 1990, with annual per capita income, estimated at $1,800, amounting to slightly more than 5% of South Korea’s.
欧洲各国奋力挣扎的中左翼党派都应当加以仿效，因为他们必须充分认识到这样的重新定位很可能关系到政治上能否生存。	Struggling center-left parties across Europe should follow suit, recognizing that such a repositioning may well be the key to political survival.
中国继续经历快速城市化进程 — — 这一现象为过去的减贫工作提供了巨大的帮助，但同时也使越来越多的城市居民陷入赤贫。	China continues to experience rapid urbanization – a phenomenon that contributed substantially to past poverty reduction, but that also places a growing number of urban dwellers at risk of destitution.
对于欧盟以南邻近地区的事件的政策、用语和反应必须与对于为了找工作而自愿从一个安全国家迁往另一个安全国家的事件有所区别。	The policies, language, and response to the events unfolding on the EU's southern border must be different from those concerning the voluntary movement of job seekers from one safe country to another.
但是，据英国气候学家凯文·安德森（Kevin Anderson）和约翰·布罗德里克（John Broderick）的研究，要兑现其气候承诺的话，欧盟必须在2035年完全禁止化石燃料。	Yet, according to a study by British climate scientists Kevin Anderson and John Broderick, in order to meet its climate commitments, the EU must phase out all fossil fuels by 2035.
目前的共识指责“精英 ” — —学术、媒体和商业精英 — — 过度沉浸在他们相对大同互通的世界中，而没有去聆听教育和互通程度较低的人民的声音。	The current consensus blames the “elites” – in academia, media, and business – for becoming so caught up in their relatively cosmopolitan and connected world that they failed to listen carefully to less educated and connected groups.
到本世纪中叶，除非日本吸纳1,700万移民，否则，其人口有可能缩小30 ％ 。 这对于一个历史上抵制移民的国家而言是一个艰巨的任务。	By mid-century, Japan’s population could shrink by 30% unless it attracts 17 million immigrants – a hard task in a country historically resistant to immigration.
如果澳大利亚想要彻底摆脱中国的干涉， 不但需要实施新的国内防御，还需要更加积极的参与捍卫国际（不论是陆上还是海上）规则与规范。	If Australia is to free itself of Chinese meddling, it will need to go beyond implementing new domestic safeguards to take a more active role in defending rules and norms beyond its borders, both on land and at sea.
对于卡扎菲这个曾试图暗杀阿卜杜拉国王，甚至连续十多年资助反沙特宣传的利比亚领导人沙特王室可没什么好感。	The Kingdom has no love for Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi, who tried to assassinate King Abdullah and has waged a concerted anti-Saudi propaganda campaign for at least a decade.
因纳夫报告指出，改革的需要不仅来源于人们对完善政府或抽象权利的渴望，而且对于拯救这个正在被慢慢扼杀的国家有着绝对的必要。	The need for reform, it argues, is not based merely on a desire for better government or abstract rights, but is necessary to save a country that is being strangled.
美国监管者对违规银行课以重罚 — — 最近巴黎银行的89亿美元和解案就是显例 — — 这已经导致欧洲银行重新考量守法成本和在美经营的盈利能力。	Hefty fines imposed by US regulators for breaching the rules – notably, the recent $8.9 billion settlement by BNP Paribas – are already causing European banks to re-think their compliance costs and the profitability of operating in the US.
其中不但包括王室成员，社会名流和其他重要人物，还包括阿富汗和伊拉克阵亡英军的家属以及2005年7月伦敦恐怖袭击遇难者的亲人。	The list includes not only royalty, celebrities, and other VIPs, but also the families of servicemen killed in Afghanistan and Iraq, and those of victims of the July 2005 terrorist attack in London.
或许，在对资本主义笃信不疑的人制定、解释、评判以及执行游戏规则的时候资本主义的表现就比怀疑者限制资本主义过度膨胀的时候要差。	Maybe capitalism works better when skeptics restrain its excesses than when true believers are writing, interpreting, judging, and executing the rules of the game.
更为重要的是，这些移民不再局限于农村人口，而且他们不再只是前往移民在美国的传统落脚点。 事实上，他们无处不在。	Moreover, these migrants are no longer exclusively of rural origin, nor do they travel only to traditional areas in the US; they are, literally, everywhere.
1979年的伊朗革命废除了亲美主义、推翻了伊朗国王的不民主统治，并以反美主义和教士的不民主统治取而代之。	Iran’s 1979 revolution did away with the pro-American, undemocratic regime of the Shah, bringing in its place the anti-American, undemocratic regime of the clerics.
当然，特朗普也许可以随时间改变美联储理事会的组成，在斯坦利·费舍尔（Stanley Fischer ） 、 莱尔·布莱恩纳德（Lael Brainard ） 、 丹尼尔·塔鲁洛（Daniel K. Tarullo）和杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome H. Powell）任期到期时任命新理事。	Of course, Trump may be able to change the Fed Board’s composition over time, by appointing new governors when Stanley Fischer, Lael Brainard, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Jerome H. Powell’s terms end.
但如果能够不断取得成功，将给未来领导人提供很有价值的经验，让他们了解私人部门的合理作用（不光是在印度，也包括全世界 ） 。	But if they continue to be a success, they will provide valuable lessons for future leaders about the proper role of the private sector not just in India, but around the world.
这种无声无息的对和平的推动一直是欧洲经济进一步一体化的主要动力，而欧洲经济一体化被看作是达到政治一体化的一种手段。	This drive for peace remained, quietly, the key motivation behind further steps toward Europe’s economic integration, which was regarded as the vehicle for achieving political integration.
但莱希死后雅罗斯瓦夫·卡钦斯基的民粹主义便不再受到控制，后者通过有效挟持中间派选民，成功地让新法案对法律与正义党有利。	But Jarosław Kaczyński, whose populism was once held in check by his brother, shaped this new legislation in ways that are politically favorable to PiS, which he leads, by effectively taking centrist voters hostage.
尽管政策自从转变后已经反映出供给方经济和真正的经济周期论，新统治模式的缔造者和推动者却也表现出对确认数据的憎恶，这是一个很严重的错误。	Although policy has since shifted to reflect supply-side economics and real business-cycle theory, the new reigning paradigm’s builders and promoters display the same antipathy to checking data for serious error.
此外，近15年来，大部分政府都相当负责：财政赤字规模很小或不存在，通货膨胀率低，实施了精确定向的扶贫计划，等等。	Furthermore, during these nearly 15 years, most governments have managed their accounts responsibly: small or no fiscal deficits, low inflation, well-targeted anti-poverty programs, and so on.
但跟共和党人一样，民主党人也热衷于给自己的竞选赞助者 — — 那些富裕的美国人 — — 提供减税优惠	But, like the Republicans, the Democrats, too, are keen to shower tax cuts on their major campaign contributors, predominantly rich Americans.
但他们还想乘胜追击 — — 将恢复小布什上任前税率的提案再推迟几年 — — 再在明年春天取得一个长期胜利。	But they want to follow up their tactical victory – which postpones the restoration of pre-Bush tax rates for a couple of years – with a longer-term victory next spring.
目前各国都拥有一定移民接收配额，可是一些国家（比如意大利）已经大大超额，因为绝望的难民们正不断穿越其边境，而其他国家（如匈牙利）则一个难民都不愿接收。	At present, there are quotas for individual countries, though some, like Italy, have more than exceeded them, as desperate refugees continue to flow across their borders, while others, such as Hungary, have refused to accept refugees at all.
但新证据表明，现代人进化于相对晚近的非洲 — — 且他们在约60 000年前分化之后所经历的改变并非连续。	But new evidence suggests that modern humans evolved relatively recently in Africa – and that the transformation that they underwent after their departure some 60,000 years ago was far from seamless.
但在该银行处理数字时，他们发现，尽管大约一半申请低端高息信用者具有警方记录，但这似乎并不反映在偿还结果上。	But when the bank ran the numbers, they discovered that although about half of the people applying for low-end, high-interest-rate credit had a police record, this did not seem to reflect on payment outcomes.
由苏联造成的潜在“军事威胁”消失得无影无踪之后，持续不断的北约东扩浪潮既不符合各方的军事利益，也不符合意识形态方面的要求。	Once the potential “military threat” posed by the Soviet Union had vanished into thin air, successive waves of NATO enlargement served neither a military nor an ideological purpose.
人们很容易理解最近在卡塔尔和巴林、埃及、沙特及阿联酋之间因为卡塔尔支持圣战组织所引发的分裂反映了这些国家的忠诚度是如何分配的。	It is easy to assume that the recent split between Qatar, on the one hand, and Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, on the other, over Qatar’s support for jihadist groups reflects these countries’ allocation of loyalties.
无论如何，因为普京很可能根本不知道谢钦的计划，随着法律诉讼程序的公开，这项计划很快就产生了适得其反的效果。	In any case, Sechin’s plan – about which Putin may well have known nothing – soon backfired, as the legal proceedings became public.
首先，基奇洛夫把阿根廷2001年债务违约和2008年全球金融危机间经济快速增长的年份归因为国内总需求的凯恩斯主义景气恢复。	First, Kicillof attributed Argentina’s rapid economic growth in the years between its 2001 debt default and the 2008 global financial crisis to a Keynesian reflation of domestic aggregate demand.
在祖布科夫被提名前，媒体纷纷流传下一任总理会成为普京的总统继承人，而现任副总理伊万诺夫是最有可能的候选人。	Before Zubkov’s nomination, reports swirled that the next prime minister would become Putin’s presidential successor, with Sergei Ivanov, a current deputy prime minister, dubbed the most likely candidate.
纽约—美国共和党总统候选人之一泰德·克鲁兹（Ted Cruz）最近说，他有办法解决中东乱局，那就是“地毯式轰炸”伊斯兰国，看看“沙子是否能在黑暗中发光 ” 。	NEW YORK – Ted Cruz, one of the Republican candidates for the US presidency, recently said that his solution to the turmoil in the Middle East would be to “carpet bomb” the Islamic State (ISIS) and see if “sand can glow in the dark.”
对于那些批评者来说，亚太经合组织只是一个空谈茶馆，而东盟则是中日两国正面交锋，印度则从旁暗中使劲的竞技场。	To cynics, APEC is a talking shop, while ASEAN is an arena for an ongoing contest between China and Japan, with India on the side.
一封由多位美国国会议员联名签署的致中国官员的信，以及由大赦国际所撰写的报告都表明中国违反了联合国禁止向苏丹提供武器的决议。	A letter to Chinese officials, signed by many members of the US Congress, and a report by Amnesty International state that China exported weapons to Sudan in violation of UN resolutions.
欧洲正在经历着一场地震式的转型，其政治制度在内部受到腐蚀（同时又容易受到俄罗斯压力的外部影响 ） 。	Europe is experiencing a seismic shift, with its political system being undermined from within (and becoming vulnerable to Russian pressure from without).
政府债务增长了25万亿美元 — — 其中发达经济体增长了19万亿美元 — — 这是严重经济衰退、财政刺激计划和银行救助计划的直接结果。	Government debt has increased by $25 trillion, with the advanced economies accounting for $19 trillion – a direct result of severe recession, fiscal-stimulus programs, and bank bailouts.
有人担心更为抽象的意识形态上的敌人，例如共产主义和所谓“美国主义 ” 。 还有人则强调“白种人 ” ( 包括日本的盟国德国和意大利)对“黄种人”的威胁。	Some were concerned with more abstract, ideological enemies, such as Communism and “Americanism,” while there were also voices highlighting the menace of the “white race” (including Japan’s allies, Germany and Italy) against the “yellow race.”
日本是世界上最发达的工业国之一，既然它都免不了出现福岛这样的事故，那么在核安全问题上绝对不能心存侥幸。	The fact that an accident such as Fukushima was possible in Japan, one of the world’s most advanced industrial countries, is a reminder that, when it comes to nuclear safety, nothing can be taken for granted.
也许，IMF的2006年报告封存起来，保存在防火墙后或黑暗网络深处，放在没有索引的灾难预测博物馆中更好。	Perhaps it would be better if the IMF’s 2006 report could be put beyond reach, behind a firewall or somewhere on the dark web, in an unindexed museum of forecasting disasters.
但如果同样的员工被告知，公司会自动将他们注册进入401k计划，缴纳额也是同样的5%的薪水，并且他们可以随时取出这笔钱，那么大部分人 会接受薪水扣除，并且不会取出资金。	But if the same employees are told that the company will automatically enroll them in a 401k plan with the same 5% salary reduction and that they may withdraw those funds at will, most accept the salary reduction and do not withdraw the funds.
服用兴奋剂使体育运动变得廉价，使胜利者被排除在其它人之外，并剥夺了那些品德高尚的优秀运动员赢得本应属于他们的夺冠机会。	Performance enhancing drugs cheapen sport, making winners out of also-rans, and depriving virtuous and superior athletes of the victories that should be theirs.
这个孩子后来完全康复了，但那是因为他及时地得到了诊断并在一家一流医院获得治疗，而对许多巴基斯坦家长来说这样的待遇可望而不可及。	The boy made a full recovery, but only because of an early diagnosis and care at a premier hospital, which is out of reach for many parents in Pakistan.
双方均敏锐认识到维持现状令他们付出高昂的成本，阻碍他们加入欧盟的努力并为两国经济都造成了不可持续的负担。	Both sides are acutely aware that the status quo implies a high cost, by hampering their EU accession bids and imposing an unsustainable burden on their respective economies.
冷战后，核武器库存有所减少（主要是出于经济原因 ） ， 目前全世界还有不到20,000核武器（仍足以将全人类毁灭好几次 ） 。	Nuclear stockpiles were reduced – mainly for economic reasons – following the Cold War, to less than 20,000 nuclear weapons worldwide (still enough to destroy humanity several times over).
与此同时，中国要认真实施精心设计的培训计划，为各层次的政府有关工作人员和企业家们提供了解海外经营基本信息和基本知识以及培训基本技能的机会。	At the same time, China should implement a well-designed training program that provides officials at all levels of government and entrepreneurs with basic information about operating abroad.
尽管金氏政权仍在努力开发能够打击美国本土的洲际弹道核导弹，但能够袭击这些邻国的中程导弹它已经完全掌握了。	Though the Kim regime is still working toward nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental US, it already has fully operational medium-range missiles that can strike its neighbors.
对于一个储蓄短缺而又继续承担着过大份额全球军费开支的美国经济来说，强权政治能否抵消其日益薄弱的基本面？	Can power politics offset the increasingly tenuous fundamentals of a saving-short US economy that continues to account for a disproportionate share of global military spending?
我们应该创造这样一个世界：在这个世界里，每一位想要学习、做老师和从事学术研究的人都能在和平环境中带着尊严实现愿望。	We should be creating a world where everyone who wishes to learn, teach, or conduct academic research can do so in peace and with dignity.
用非常规货币政策 — — 包括各种形式的量化宽松以及宣布延长低利率期限等 — — 实现这些目标或许不无道理。	To the extent that unconventional monetary policy – including various forms of quantitative easing, as well as pronouncements about prolonging low interest rates – serves these roles, it might be justified.
艾滋病、饥荒、武装冲突以及全球气候变暖等问题与政府无能、霍乱以及新近的自然灾害等一道在争取人们的注意力。	AIDS, hunger, armed conflict, and global warming compete for attention alongside government failure, malaria, and the latest natural disaster.
随着互联网的出现，这一点也发生了改变，在互联网上，任何人的想法，不管多么令人厌恶和荒谬，都会得到传播。	This changed with the Internet, where anybody’s thoughts, no matter how obnoxious or absurd, can be aired.
1993年6月，在与美国对华和威胁退出核不扩散条约（NPT）后，朝鲜允许国际原子能机构（IAEA）进行有限度的“保障活动 ” 。	In June 1993, following talks with the US and a threat to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), North Korea allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct limited “safeguards activities.”
卡斯现就职于偏右派的曼哈顿政策研究中心，也曾是共和党人米特·罗姆尼（Mitt Romney）总统竞选团队的国内政策主管。	Cass is at the right-of-center Manhattan Institute for Policy Research and was domestic policy director for Republican Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.
他指责英国是“失败主义者 ” ， 指出阿富汗恶化的安全形势是可以通过伊拉克式的“大量增兵”来解决的，在伊拉克的增兵行动无疑大大降低了该国的暴力活动水平。	He accused the British of being “defeatist” and argued that Afghanistan’s deteriorating security situation could be addressed with an Iraq-style “surge,” which has undoubtedly brought down violence levels in that country.
但相比研究长着尖锐牙齿、行动隐蔽、冲刺能力令人叹为观止的华丽的捕食动物，研究它们的猎物才是我的专长。	But, rather than study the flashy predators – with their sharp teeth, stealthy approaches, and impressive sprinting abilities – I focus on their food.
在这一背景下 — — 以及在巴黎和哥本哈根恐怖袭击造成的恐慌的影响下 — — 欧盟即将制定新的关键性移民议程。	Against this backdrop – and that of the fear sown by the terrorist attacks in Paris and Copenhagen – the European Union is set to develop a new – and critically important – agenda on migration.
2007年底在罗马一次备受批评的讲话中，萨科奇承认了法国的基督教根基，称法国是“教堂最年长的女儿 ” ； 他还在对沙特阿拉伯的访问中赞扬伊斯兰教。	In a much criticized speech in Rome at the end of 2007, Sarkozy acknowledged the Christian roots of France, “the eldest daughter of the Church”; he also praised Islam during a visit to Saudi Arabia.
但考虑到世界经济当前面临的结构问题以及生产消费之间的巨大缺口，一个全球增长协议如今显得更加必不可少。	But a global growth pact looks even more indispensable today, given the world economy’s structural problems and huge imbalances between production and consumption.
意大利众多的工会，雇主联合会，所有的反对党，甚至连贝卢斯科尼旗下的许多议员都已经联合起来，共同反对这个在他们看来有点神经不正常的提案。	The trade unions, employers’ associations, all opposition political parties, and even many of Berlusconi’s own MPs have united against what they consider to be an aberration.
至于欧盟，它正在做出巴黎协定的最强承诺：到2030年将地区内温室气体排放量至少降低到1990年水平的60 % 。	For its part, the EU is offering the strongest pledge yet for the Paris agreement: a reduction in domestic greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 40%, relative to their level in 1990, by 2030.
变幻无常的选民可以更换上次的获胜者，但参选双方都可以说服选民，而不必非要依靠极端手段获得多数后才能执政。	A volatile electorate can replace last time’s winner, but both can try to persuade voters and govern without having to go to extremes to gain a majority.
此外，中国军事实力的扩张成为美国国家安全界跨党派的关注点，尽管其防务支出仍然只有美国的几分之一（这一点经常被忘得一干二净 ） 。	Moreover, China’s expanding military has become a source of bipartisan concern in US national-security circles, even though its defense spending is still but a fraction of America’s (a point often lost amid all the hand-wringing).
全球化的所有替代方案要么不现实，要么令人害怕，要么两者兼具，那么，我们怎样才能升华、克服或至少疏导我们的恐惧？	Given that all alternatives to globalization are unrealistic, frightening, or both, how can we sublimate, transcend, or at least channel our fears?
它们需要评估自己未来几年所需动用的资源和资产，同时应该强调必要基础设施的社会价值而不仅仅是直接财务回报。	They need to assess the resources and assets that will be required in the years ahead. And they should highlight the social value, rather than only the immediate financial returns, of essential infrastructure.
数百万穷困失业年轻人正在寻求另类活路，而这正是猛烈抨击国家领导人乃是全人口麻烦的罪魁的博科圣地可以提供的。	Millions of impoverished, unemployed young people now seek an alternative, which Boko Haram, with its incendiary rhetoric blaming the country’s leaders for the population’s troubles, can provide.
还有不少父母拒绝为子女接种疫苗，特别是由神职人员以命令语气要求的疫苗接种，因为他们认为这种公共卫生手段实际上是一种隐蔽的避孕项目。	There have also been cases of refusal by parents to vaccinate their children, typically at the behest of clergy members, owing to the belief that such public-health efforts are in fact a covert sterilization program.
去年年底，计算机和网络研究人员透露伊斯兰国在所谓的黑暗网络上表现得异常活跃，这条消息既不令人吃惊也没有夸大其词。	Late last year, computer and network security researchers revealed, to little surprise or fanfare, that ISIS was active on the so-called dark web.
即便对离岸钻井程序和政策的调整制订已是当务之急，但如果缺乏其他控制需求方面的措施的话，效果就必然是不全面的。	While a regulatory overhaul of offshore drilling procedures and policies is clearly necessary, it will be insufficient to reduce the risk of spills and accidents if it is not accompanied by other demand-side measures.
要让如此复杂的系统起作用，欧元区决策者必须能够相信彼此以特定方式行事 — — 而这有需要共同规则和标准框架。	For such a complex system to work, eurozone policymakers must be able to trust one another to behave in a particular way – and that requires a common framework of rules and standards.
至于现在，正如美国总统奥巴马所说，从美国的立场看，负担仍“在于要想世界证明其核计划只用和平目的 ” 。	For now, as President Barack Obama put it, the burden remains, from the US point of view, “on Iran to prove to the world that its nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes.”
在公民纲领党八年执政期间，波兰的国内生产总值增长近25 % ， 而失业率和预算赤字几乎下降了一半左右。	During the PO government’s eight years in power, Poland’s GDP grew by almost 25%, while unemployment and the budget deficit fell by almost half.
我以前的合著者卡门·莱恩哈特（Carmen Reinhart）也发表了类似的观点 — — 也许表达得更清晰。	My sometime co-author Carmen Reinhart makes the same point, perhaps even more clearly.
但莫拉莱斯之所以能够成为融合这三大标志领域的领袖确乎反映了这样一个事实：20世纪90年代的机构改革扩大了社会参与基础，为新兴领导人和政治运动带来了发展机遇。	But the making of Morales as a leader able to combine these three dimensions reflects two institutional reforms in the 1990’s that expanded social participation and opened up opportunities for new leaders and political movements.
沙拉菲圣战主义并不是一个组织机构，而是一个基于“各种形式的武装斗争策略都是最有效的 — — 在某些说法中也是最具合法性的 — — 社会和政治变革方式”这一核心信念的思潮。	Salafi jihadism is not an organization, but an ideological trend based on the core belief that armed tactics of all kinds are the most effective – and, in some versions, the most legitimate – method of bringing about social and political change.
只要外国人渴望获得美元，美国就可以随心所欲地在世界范围内投射自身力量，而支付这一切只需打开印刷机即可。	As long as foreigners are hungry for dollars, the US can spend whatever it needs to project power around the world. To pay for it all, it need only turn on the printing press.
人权状况无疑仍有改进的空间 — — 特别是对待反对派政治领袖米迪克莎的方式 — — 但邻国厄立特里亚伊萨亚斯·阿费沃尔基的政权比起埃塞俄比亚还要差很多。	The human-rights situation could undoubtedly be improved – in particular, the treatment of the political opposition leader Birtukan Mideksa – but Isaias Afwerki’s regime in neighboring Eritrea is worse by orders of magnitude.
如今，达尔文的进化论与其说是个帮助，不如说是一种阻碍，因为他已经变成了一个准理论教条，妨碍了我们改善研究方式并获得随之产生的好处。	Today, Darwin’s theory of evolution is more a hindrance than a help, because it has become a quasi-theological creed that is preventing the benefits of improved research from being fully realized.
内贾德掌权后，鲁哈尼失去了委员会秘书的职务，但成为哈梅内伊在委员会的个人代表并一直担任这一角色至今。	When Ahmadinejad came to power, Rowhani lost his position as the Council’s secretary, but became Khamenei’s personal representative to it – a post that he has held until now.
塔斯马尼亚—7月中旬，一场严重的旱灾毁掉了庄稼，一些欧洲奶农和肉农被迫提前宰杀牲口降低需要喂养的动物数量。	TASMANIA – In mid-July, as a brutal drought decimated crops, some European dairy and meat farmers were forced to cull their herds early to reduce the number of animals they needed to feed.
事实上，这个问题是如此棘手，以至于信奉阴谋论的退欧派现在开始怀疑欧盟谈判员利用它来拖延和妨碍不列颠海盗号的光荣起航。	In fact, the problem is so intractable that conspiracy-minded Brexiteers now suspect EU negotiators of using it to delay or stymie Buccaneer Britannia’s glorious departure.
这样一笔基金能帮助50%因冲突、内战或人道主义紧急状况而失学的全球儿童 — — 符合条件的男孩和女孩约有2，800万。	Such a pool of money would help the roughly 50% of the world’s children who are out of school – some 28 million boys and girls – because of conflicts, civil wars, or humanitarian emergencies.
一年后，欧盟领导人再次汇聚塔林，并通过了一项截止“2019年5月欧洲议会选举前指导欧盟行动”的“领导人计划 ” 。	One year later, EU leaders reconvened in Tallinn and adopted a “Leaders’ Agenda” to “guide EU action up until the European Parliament elections in May 2019.”
十九世纪普鲁士军官兼军事理论家克劳塞维茨（Carl von Clausewitz）有预见性地看到了他死后不到一百年便成为现实的总体战（total war）时代。	The nineteenth-century Prussian military officer and theorist Carl von Clausewitz spoke presciently about the age of total war that would arrive less than a century after his death.
要想实现全球目标机构制定的孕产妇保健、儿童保健和传染病控制政策，2020年的研发经费必须是现在的两倍。	If we want to achieve the targets established by the Global Goals for maternal health, child health, and infectious disease, we will have to double R&D funding by 2020.
这一相对衰落背后的原因是美国教育体系不能保证对后进美国人的高质量教育，特别是对来自穷人、少数族裔和移民家庭的孩子。	A major factor behind that relative decline has been the US school system’s failure to ensure high-quality education for disadvantaged Americans, particularly children from poor, minority, and immigrant households.
自然本身就能提供这样的方案，并充当更健康、更加生机盎然的社区的催化剂，推动投资，让城市全方位更加成功。	Nature itself can offer such solutions and be a catalyst for healthier, more vibrant neighborhoods, driving investment and making cities more successful by any measure.
以艾玛·冈萨雷斯（Emma González）这位原本默默无闻的佛罗里达少年为例，她在一夜之间“聚集”的推特粉丝要比全国步枪协会的粉丝还多两倍。	Consider Emma González, a previously unknown Florida teenager who “assembled” two times more Twitter followers than the National Rifle Association almost overnight.
但是，当我们一步一步扼杀自由新闻舆论残余时，甚至当小规模电视频道提供未经审查的信息时都面临危险时，我们正紧紧地捂住茶壶的盖子。	But when we stifle, step by step, all that remains of a free press, when even small television channels that provide uncensored information seem dangerous, we are keeping the lid firmly on the pot.
在全世界领导人准备实施最有雄心的全球代办事项清单之际 — — 可持续发展目标将从1月1日开始开始 — — 决定从哪里开始也许是一个艰巨的任务。	As world leaders prepare to enact the most ambitious global to-do list yet – the Sustainable Development Goals will be launched on January 1 – deciding where to begin may seem a daunting task.
官员们要努力确保传达给委员会的不仅仅是受资助机构透过正式分析所产生的结果，还必须将其代入到某个复杂的现实情况并加以透视分析。	Great care is taken by officials to inform the Committee not just of the results of formal analysis by the sponsoring bodies, but also of complex real-world conditions and perspectives.
这些BRICs国家(我们也可以把它们换成巨大帝国们称呼)更为容易地发挥实力，但是它们还要发挥实力来弥补其弱点。	The BRICs (we might rewrite the term as Big and Really Imperial Countries) project power more easily, but they also need to project power to compensate for their weaknesses.
日本希望日本承担更多的维持亚洲安全的责任，这无济于事，让日本扮演这一角色或许在战略和金融上有意义，但也暴露出缺少对政治环境的理解。	It does not help that the US wants Japan to shoulder more of the burden of maintaining Asia’s security, a position that may make sense strategically and financially, but that betrays a lack of understanding of the political context.
圣战组织的派系以及后来的塔利班用货车从楠阿哈省及周边地区向巴基斯坦出口品种优良的杉木，经常以此交换武器。	Mujahedin factions and later the Taliban exported stands of fine-grained cedar by the truckload from Nangahar and surrounding provinces to Pakistan, often in return for arms.
这项协议将建立在2001年波恩协议基础之上。 波恩协议为民主阿富汗制定了框架，但是，在克服这一饱受战乱之苦的国家悲剧性的遗产上仍然有所欠缺。	The compact builds on the 2001 Bonn Agreement, which laid the framework for a democratic Afghanistan but left much to be done to overcome that war-torn country’s tragic legacy.
尽管自由职业和兼职劳动并非新鲜事，但共享经济不同，因为它让自由职业者变成了“纳米工人 ” （ nano-worker ） ， 他们改换雇主不是以月乃至于周计算，而是以日计算。	Though self-employment and part-time labor are hardly new, the sharing economy is different, because it allows freelancers to become “nano-workers,” shifting among employers not just monthly or even weekly, but several times a day.
奥巴马选定负责非洲事务的国务卿约翰尼·卡森在总统访问前说 ， “ 政府计划在若干年内投入大笔的资金用于农业发展 。 ”	“The administration plans over a number of years to put a substantial amount of money into agricultural development,” Obama’s choice for Secretary of State for African Affairs, Johnnie Carson, said in advance of the president’s trip.
这就要求新形式的包容多边主义 — — 也适用于实现作为巴黎协定承诺的补充的可持续发展目标（SDG ） 。	This calls for a new form of inclusive multilateralism – one that can also be applied to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which complement the Paris agreement’s commitments.
2013年，由我担任首席经济学家的世界银行首次宣布，所有社会都应该将迈向“共享繁荣”的目标作为使命 ， “ 共享繁荣”一词也成为热门词汇。	In 2013, the World Bank, where I am Chief Economist, helped bring the term “shared prosperity” into everyday discourse by declaring, for the first time, that every society should make progress toward this goal its mission.
陈水扁总是指责国民党阻挠一系列明智经济计划的通过，但即使是他自己的一些富有的资助者都有对这些计划嗤之以鼻。	Chen invariably blamed the KMT for blocking sensible economic plans, but even some of his moneyed supporters knew better.
说到底，中国经济的复杂性和特殊性意味着评估当前状况和表现需要以细节为导向的分析，尽可能多地考虑抵消性因素。	The bottom line is that the complexity and distinctiveness of China’s economy mean that assessing its current state and performance requires a detail-oriented analysis that accounts for as many offsetting factors as possible.
他决意辞去首相职务的时候，这种压力很大程度上影响了他对接班人的选择。 他最终选择的现任首相阿卜杜拉.	This impulse strongly affected his choice of a successor when he decided to step down as prime minister.
但他们可以做的 — — 也确实做了的 — — 是强调降低风险和强化预防，从而拯救无数人的生命、构建更强的恢复力。	But what they can do – and have done – is emphasize risk reduction and strengthen preparedness, thereby saving lives and building greater resilience.
于是，债权人 — — 主要是德国和法国银行 — — 将不会在现有贷款上发生损失，同时债务人赢得了更多的事件来“打扫房子 ” 。	Thus, creditors – mainly German and French banks – are not expected to suffer losses on their existing loans, while borrowers gain more time to “put their houses in order.”
俄罗斯主权债务低到可忽略不计，并有稳定的预算盈余，外汇储备也以每年300美元的速度增加，额外支出300亿美元补贴退休金不应该是一个大问题。	For a country with negligible sovereign debt, a stable budget surplus, and foreign-currency reserves that grow by $30 billion each year, spending an extra $30 billion to subsidize pensions should not be a major problem.
即便是巴林这样的小国，执政的逊尼派也能在逊尼派邻国的军事协助下继续维持对人口占大多数的什叶派的统治。	Even in tiny Bahrain, the Sunni minority has, for now, succeeded in maintaining its rule over the Shia majority, albeit with military help from neighboring Sunni-led countries.
但它也看到，欧佩克已经毫无用处。 这个它在1973年第一次阿拉伯石油禁运期间强加给世界的组织此后一直被用作沙特石油政策的屏障。	But it also sees that it has no more use for OPEC, an organization that it foisted on the world with the first Arab oil embargo in 1973 and has since used as a shield for its oil policies.
1989年，共产主义的崩溃让弗朗西斯·福山（Francis Fukuyama）宣布“历史的终结 ” ， 两年后，老布什总统庆祝世界大国间互相合作的“新世界秩序 ” 。	In 1989, with the collapse of communism, Francis Fukuyama announced “the end of history,” and two years later President George H. W. Bush celebrated a “new world order” of cooperation between the world’s powers.
就在上个月，我赴中国考察了那些原本偏远但如今因为基础设施投资而与外界连通 — — 并因此带来人员，商品和理念的更自由流动 — — 并因此实现繁荣的地区。	Last month, I visited formerly remote areas of the country that are now prosperous as a result of the connectivity – and thus the freer flow of people, goods, and ideas – that such investments have delivered.
就连他们厌恶税收的金主们也在赞赏这群乌合之众捍卫其财产做法的同时，开始对这种不计后果的想法给投资环境和股票价格造成的冲击表示担忧。	Even their tax-averse sponsors, while appreciative of the rabble’s efforts to protect their wealth, are now fearful of the impact of these wayward ideas on the investment climate and equity prices.
伊朗有权寻求外部势力不会强迫其更换政权的保证，但是它不能见风使舵，在寻求不更换国内政权保证的同时，却在邻国内推行这一点。	Iran is entitled to seek assurances against externally forced regime change. But it cannot have it both ways, seeking guarantees against regime change at home, and promoting it in its neighborhood.
在这 些政策背后的“新凯恩斯主义”模型假设一个经济体的“真正”潜力 — — 以及可以利用扩张性政策来填补（以实现充分就业）的所谓产出缺口 — — 是可以被精确测算 的。	The “New Keynesian” models underpinning these policies assumed that an economy’s “true” potential – and thus the so-called output gap that expansionary policy is supposed to fill to attain full employment – can be precisely measured.
更令人惊奇的是，法国公共部门支出的GDP占比比德国还要高12个百分点，而它们的健康、教育和贫困等问题的结果并无显著不同。	Even more striking perhaps, French public bodies spend 12 percentage points of GDP more than those in Germany, with no significant difference in outcomes in terms of health, education, or poverty.
它植根于二战后的“秩序自由主义 ” （ ordoliberalism）思想，该思想认为政府应该执行契约和确保充分竞争，但也要避免干涉经济。	It is rooted in the post-World War II doctrine of “ordoliberalism,” which counseled that government should enforce contracts and ensure adequate competition but otherwise avoid interfering in the economy.
伊斯坦布尔—在最近的土耳其大选中，选民在五个月的时间里两次前往投票站，其结果揭示了土耳其民主以及土耳其人民偏好的一些重要特点。	ISTANBUL – The outcome of Turkey’s latest general election – voters have gone to the polls twice in the last five months – reveals important insights into the nature of the country’s democracy and the preferences of its citizens.
更糟糕的是，信贷风险现实化所造成的巨额亏损将威胁到欧元区核心经济体的债务可持续性，进而威胁到欧盟的生存。	Worse still, massive losses resulting from the materialization of credit risk might jeopardize core eurozone economies’ debt sustainability, placing the survival of the European Union itself in question.
我们目光短浅地只把注意力集中在这个问题上而对地球面临的其他挑战很少关注，将会因为戈尔获得诺贝尔和平奖所引发的关注而进一步加剧这种状况。	Our blinkered focus on it – to the detriment of other planetary challenges – will only be heightened by the attention generated by Gore’s Nobel Peace Prize.
在特朗普本人称之为对其总统地位的全民公投的中期选举中，众议院和参议院的民主党候选人都大胜他们的共和党对手。	In the midterm elections, which Trump himself described as a referendum on his presidency, the Democratic candidates for both the House and Senate vastly outpolled their Republican opponents.
在加州和德克萨斯州的一些地方，部分水以几乎免费的形式供应给消费者 — — 通过几十年前建造的水坝、水库和水渠供水。	In some parts of California and Texas, a portion of the water supply is provided to consumers for almost nothing – delivered by a network of dams, reservoirs, and aqueducts that were built decades ago.
巴勒斯坦权力机构主席阿巴斯及其同侪心知肚明，联合国的承认本身并不能让以色列停止侵占，也不能保证主权巴勒斯坦国的完全实现。	Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his colleagues know perfectly well that UN recognition by itself will not deliver an end to occupation and the full realization of a sovereign Palestine.
然后，希腊经济中思维迟钝的社团主义 — — 公共部门的官官相护和任人唯亲以及私人部门根深蒂固的精英 — — 将获得新的喘息机会。	Then the economy’s stultifying corporatism – clientelism and cronyism in the public sector and vested interests and entrenched elites in the private sector – would gain a new lease on life.
但目前这种希望已经破灭，因为当前席卷西方的民粹主义运动正利用公众对新生世界秩序的不满在选举中攻城拔寨。	But that hope has faded now that populist movements across the West, tapping into public discontent about the dawning world order, have succeeded at the polls.
最近的希腊金融危机是现实与虚夸之间存在鸿沟的又一例证。 事实上，这是一场由 “ 扩大 ” （ 现在讨论的是欧元区扩大）引发的危机。	Now Wolfgang Schauble, Germany’s Finance Minister, has said enough is enough.
如果不想像波斯尼亚那样引发全境范围内的大规模血腥种族清洗，美国人和其他人除了习惯生活在越来越多样化的社会里之外其实别无选择。	Short of unleashing massive and bloody ethnic cleansing – Bosnia, on a continental scale – Americans and others have no choice but to get used to living in increasingly diverse societies.
基础设施计划可以创造大量生产性工作岗位并分配财富，它是一个良好的起点 — — 如果她的民主党能够同时赢得参议院，推行这一计划就将容易得多。	An infrastructure program, by creating huge numbers of productive jobs and distributed wealth, would be a good start – one that would be far easier to achieve if her Democratic Party also won the Senate.
尽管有东亚、印度和其他几个国家的高速经济增长，世界许多地方在过去25年以来的经济增长还是慢于此前的25年。	Growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years, despite more rapid growth in East Asia, India, and a few other countries.
在1945年制定的最初的集体安全概念里，各国应该联合起来阻止并惩罚侵略者。 这一概念由于苏联和西方在冷战时期的敌对而未能实现。	The original 1945 concept of collective security, by which states would band together to deter and punish aggressors, failed because the Soviet Union and the West were at loggerheads during the Cold War.
但许多负责保护境内世界遗产的政府不但没有采取强有力的气候行动；实际上还在积极运行煤矿和煤电等肮脏能源项目。	Yet many of the governments responsible for protecting these sites within their borders are not only failing to take strong climate action; they are actively pursuing dirty energy projects like coal mines and coal-fired power plants.
但应得权利止于国界：他们认为在个体国家内进行更大规模再分配是绝对必要的，但新兴市场或发展中国家的人不在此列。	But the entitlement stops at the border: though they regard greater redistribution within individual countries as an absolute imperative, people who live in emerging markets or developing countries are left out.
以某些市场工具指标来衡量的通胀预期在升息之后实际有所下降，表明市场对欧洲央行限制价格压力的信心增强。	Inflationary expectations, as measured by the rates on certain market instruments, actually fell after the hike, indicating increased confidence that the ECB will keep a lid on price pressures.
但是如果您真投了钱，就等于压注委内瑞拉债券回报率继续上升，而这意味着希望某些极为糟糕的事情发生在委内瑞拉人民身上。	But if you do, you will root for Venezuelan debt, which means wishing for really bad things to happen to Venezuela’s people.
土耳其的攻势还表明，这些变化已经超越了近期土耳其-以色列紧张局势的范畴，后者只是更深层趋势的一小部分。	The Turkish offensive is also an indication that these changes go beyond the current tensions between Turkey and Israel, which are just one facet of much deeper trends.
伦齐不仅需要获得已经在公投议题中陷入严重分裂的本党派的支持，还需要争取已经对政治大失所望的意大利选民的支持。	Renzi will need the support not just of his own party, which is deeply divided over the referendum, but also of an Italian electorate that has grown disillusioned with politics in general.
别人看待法国人的方式影响着法国人对自己的判断，对于我们来讲，没有比被视为冷漠或干脆默默无闻更令人苦恼的问题了。	The way we French are perceived by others affects how we perceive ourselves, and nothing is more troubling for us than to be perceived with indifference or, worse, not to be noticed at all.
但国民收入账户数据表明过去二十年的平均年增长率为4.5 % ， 即2010年人均支出为1673美元，比世行的估计高出2.5倍左右。	But national-income-accounts data show a 4.5% annual rise, on average, over the last two decades, translating into per capita expenditure of $1,673 in 2010 – roughly 2.5 times higher than the Bank’s estimate.
它可能意味着某些东西不受限制，易于获取，却又较易受到侵害；或者可能意味着某个个人或者机构行事光明磊落，从不鬼鬼祟祟。	It can mean that something is unrestricted, accessible, and possibly vulnerable; or it can mean that something, such as a person or institution, is transparent, as opposed to secretive.
我们都通过不同的方式将自己呈现给他人以塑造给人留下的印象：比如我们说“人靠衣装 ” ， 政治家也会针对不同的受众选择衣着。	We all present ourselves to others in a variety of ways in order to manage the impressions we make: for example, we “dress for success.” Politicians, too, “dress” differently for different audiences.
发自加州拉古娜海滩 — — 当今西方政府面临的其中一个最艰巨的挑战，就是如何去启动和引导那些转型性的 — — 以及对个人及企业来说，自我赋权（self-empowering）的 — — 科技革新力量。	LAGUNA BEACH – One of the most difficult challenges facing Western governments today is to enable and channel the transformative – and, for individuals and companies, self-empowering – forces of technological innovation.
因为雌性承担着繁衍后代的任务，外表不引人注目似乎是明智的选择 — — 因此在自然界中这种现象也是比较普遍的。	Given that females bear the physical burden of offspring, an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous – and thus more common – in nature.
对气候研究这的调查，以及对数千份科学出版物的分析一致显示，97—98%的研究者同意人为排放造成了全球变暖。	Polls of climate researchers, as well as analysis of thousands of scientific publications, consistently show a 97-98% consensus that human-caused emissions are causing global warming.
虽然去年百万穆斯林移民入境总体而言并未损害经济 — — 德国经济仍然实现了充分就业 — — 但仍有很多人反对默克尔总理提出的建设文化更加多元的新德国的目标。	Though the arrival of a million largely Muslim immigrants last year has not hurt the economy – which remains at full employment – many people are rejecting Chancellor Angela Merkel’s vision of a new, more multicultural Germany.
石油市场的恐慌性溢价可能会显著上升，因而引起石油价格上涨20 % ， 这就会导致美国、欧洲、日本、中国、印度和所有其他石油净进口的发达国家及新兴市场出现负增长效应。	The fear premium in oil markets may significantly rise and increase oil prices by 20%, leading to negative growth effects in the US, Europe, Japan, China, India and all other advanced economies and emerging markets that are net oil importers.
对民族主义和中国的自尊 — — 以及美国自身在处理对华关系时的指导思想 — — 之间的关系视而不见将让美国付出更加沉重的代价。	Being blind to the connection between nationalism and dignity in China – and in America’s own conduct when dealing with China – may cost the US even more.
经济学是一个有着多种模型的工具 — — 每一种都代表着现实生活的某个方面，经济学家的能力就体现在如何运用正确的模式来解决当前问题。	Economics is really a toolkit with multiple models – each a different, stylized representation of some aspect of reality. One’s skill as an economist depends on the ability to pick and choose the right model for the situation.
CER指出，英国产品和劳动力市场监管更加类似于美国而不是西欧，经合组织对企业家精神的壁垒的评估也发现了类似的广泛模式。	The CER points out that product- and labor-market regulation in the UK are closer to that of the United States than to Western Europe, and the same broad pattern emerges from the OECD’s assessment of barriers to entrepreneurship.
例如在德国，三大银行外资占总资产的比例开始发生逆转，从2007年的65%下降到2016年的33 % 。	In Germany, for example, the ratio of foreign to total assets at the three largest banks flipped, from 65% in 2007 to 33% in 2016.
联合国难民事务高级专员报告自2008年以来，自然灾害造成每年超过2600万人流离失所 — — 几乎占到这一时期被迫流离失所者总人数的1/3。	The UN High Commission on Refugees reports that natural disasters have displaced more than 26 million people per year since 2008 – almost a third of the total number of forcibly displaced people in this time period.
正如关税保护在通缩的流动性陷阱式条件下不构成宏观经济问题，经济学家们所所熟悉的秘方 — — 自由贸易也不是解决方案。	Just as tariff protection is not a macroeconomic problem in deflationary, liquidity-trap-like conditions, freer trade, the economist’s familiar nostrum, is not a solution.
其他人，比如保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman ） ， 则认为这是一种欺瞒：保守党一心想要小政府，为此不惜牺牲经济增长。	Others, such as the economist Paul Krugman, see it as an act of bad faith: the Tories just want smaller government, regardless of the consequences for growth.
夏时制的批评者们担心如果太阳在工作时间结束时还没下山，管理人员会感觉自己必须继续工作并逼迫下属也这样做。	Critics of DST fear that, if the sun is still out at the end of business hours, managers will feel pressure to continue working and push their employees to do the same.
然而2018年才刚刚开始，中国的经济体量已经是日本的2.5倍，是印度的5倍，是巴西的6倍，是俄罗斯的8倍，比整个欧元区还要大。	Yet 2018 has barely started, and already China’s economy is two-and-a-half times larger than Japan’s, five times larger than India’s, six times larger than Brazil’s, and eight times larger than Russia’s. It is also larger than the entire eurozone.
85年前，美国参议员里德·史穆特（Reed Smoot）和众议员威利斯·哈雷（Willis Hawley）打响了第一枪，炮制了1930年关税法案。	More than 85 years ago, US Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis Hawley fired the first shot in sponsoring the Tariff Act of 1930.
只要没发生恐怖主义核战争这类噩梦场景，你可以期望我的后继者们在2075年回顾往事，并欣喜地发现他们的世界也比我们今天要好上三倍。	Short of a nightmare scenario like terror-driven nuclear war, you can expect my successors in 2075 to look back and relish that, once again, their world is three times better off than ours is today.
为了应对国内权力挑战，俄罗斯总统普京的外交政策可能变得更加激进，而约旦、黎巴嫩和土耳其都因为叙利亚的崩溃而正在受到冲击。	Russian President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy may become more aggressive in response to challenges to his power at home, while Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey are all being destabilized by Syria’s ongoing meltdown.
伊斯兰堡－现在，巴基斯坦的佩尔韦兹·穆沙拉夫在面对对其总统职位最严重的挑战 — — 新的经过民主选举出来的政府可能对其进行的弹劾 — — 的时候，他事实上是孤零零的。	ISLAMABAD – Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan stands virtually alone today while facing the most serious challenge to his presidency: possible impeachment by the new democratically-elected government.
是欧洲雄心勃勃的气候政策 — — 试图增加使用“坏”能源的成本 — — 毁坏了欧洲大陆的工业基础吗？	Are Europe’s highly ambitious climate policies – which seek to increase costs for “bad” energy sources – destroying the continent’s industrial base?
不过，世界上所有的政府好象都向选民承诺：增加的政府预算可以从其他有效率的运转上节余出来，但事实证明这都是空谈。	But governments all over the world are always convinced that their expansions can be substantially financed by efficiency gains, and that dream usually proves chimerical.
Antyufeyev 正利用明斯克协议达成的脆弱停火创建克隆的克格勃服务MGB，恐吓被困在顿巴斯的乌克兰民众屈从于克里姆林的代理规则。	Antyufeyev is using the tenuous ceasefire agreed under the Minsk Protocol to create a cloned KGB service, called the MGB, to intimidate Ukrainian citizens trapped in Donbas into submitting to proxy Kremlin rule.
伴随迅速经济增长出现的则是更富裕的消费者，反之亦然：2000年代（2008年金融危机爆发之前）非洲GDP总增长的45%来自于经济中与消费者有关的部门。	With rapid economic growth have come more prosperous consumers – and vice versa: 45% of Africa’s total GDP growth in the 2000’s (before the financial crisis erupted in 2008) came from consumer-related sectors of the economy.
市场只有在制度及法律框架下才能起作用，其中包括产权、合同的强制执行、质量和信息控制及许多其它用来管理交易的法规。	Markets can function only within an institutional and legal framework that includes property rights, enforcement of contracts, quality and information controls, and many other rules to govern transactions.
这一可获得资金和投资者和企业家需求（特别是发展中国家的投资者和企业家）在时界上的不匹配是阻挠增长的脆弱性的源头。	The mismatch between the time horizon of available funding and that of investors and entrepreneurs, particularly those in developing economies, is a source of vulnerability that acts as an impediment to growth.
2006年，法国经济只增长了2.2 ％ ， 而根据德国经济研究所所做的最新预测，预计2007年和2008年的增长率相应只有2.1％和1.9 ％ 。	In 2006, it grew by only 2.2%, while growth rates of only 2.1% and 1.9% can be expected for 2007 and 2008, respectively, according to a recent forecast by the German Economic Research Institutes.
于是产生了1933年银行法，该法将美联储的权力扩大到贴现和购买票据、汇票和本票，从而保证零售银行能获得流动性满足存款人的需要。	The result was the Banking Act of 1933, which expanded the Fed’s powers to discount and purchase notes, drafts, and bills, thereby ensuring that retail banks would have the liquidity required to meet depositors’ needs.
下一任么联储主席必须在必要时果断行动说服同僚；但是，最重要的一点事，他需要怀着谦卑和尊重之心对待同僚的观点。	The next chairman will have to move decisively to persuade colleagues when needed; but, first and foremost, he or she will need a heavy dose of humility and respect for the views of his or her peers.
现实是，拥有了更大的决策权和更强的联系和技能，英格兰北部城市能够大大增加活力，有望扭转几十年来经济相对衰落的趋势。	The reality is that, with greater decision-making authority and more linkages and skills, England’s northern cities could become far more dynamic, potentially reversing decades of relative economic decline.
这样的投资应部分来自国际发展援助，上述援助计划应更加重视性及生殖健康服务，而其余的投资则应来自国家政府。	Such investment should come partly from international development assistance, which must place a higher priority on sexual- and reproductive-health services, and partly from national governments.
特朗普思想瞄准了奥巴马的两大招牌式成就：2010年平价医疗法 （ “ 奥巴马医保 ” ） 和2015年伊朗核协议。	Donald Trump Thought takes aim at two of Obama’s signature achievements: the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
我的华盛顿布鲁金斯研究所同事格雷厄姆（Carl Graham）和尼科洛娃（Milena Nikolova）通过盖洛普全球民调（Gallup World Poll）的数据发现，最幸福的人群是那些自愿参与兼职工作的人。	Using the Gallup World Poll, my colleagues at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, Carol Graham and Milena Nikolova, have found that the happiest cohorts are those who work part-time voluntarily.
展望未来，债务比率上升，短期利率上升以及通货膨胀的进一步上涨这三者的综合作用会将十年期债券的名义收益率推高到4％以上。	Looking ahead, the combination of the rising debt ratio, higher short-term interest rates, and further increases in inflation will push the nominal yield on ten-year bonds above 4%.
没有人会否认在过去的一年房价和股市的跳水，如此快速长期的价格下滑 — — 远远超出了历史上的纪录 — — 更加引发并加重了危机的产生。	No one now denies that the past year’s sharp downswings in housing and equity prices, which followed long upswings – far above historical benchmark levels – helped to trigger and fuel the crisis.
此外，你是啥并不光取决于你吃啥，还取决于你做啥。 脂肪加碳水化合物的组合给新陈代谢提出了太高的要求。	Furthermore, you are what you do with what you eat.Combining fat and carbohydrate places high demands on the metabolic process.
在经历了几十年的不公和低效统治后（更不用说悲剧性的外国干预了 ） ， 有大量被剥夺公民权、生活无望的人民可供伊斯兰国这样的组织招募利用。	After decades of unjust and ineffective rule, not to mention tragic foreign interventions, there is no shortage of disenfranchised and frustrated citizens for organizations like the Islamic State to recruit.
武装激进分子去年夏天打击了埃及驻西奈半岛前哨部队并杀害16名士兵，这表明恐怖主义对埃及的威胁不亚于以色列。	The attack on an Egyptian army outpost in the Sinai last summer, in which armed militants killed 16 soldiers, demonstrated that terrorism threatens Egypt just as it does Israel.
但这也暴露了其中的危机：对短期经济发展状况的怠慢导致专业经济学家忽略了他们有资格发表意见的中期趋势。	The danger is that disengagement from short-term developments leads academic economists to ignore medium-term trends that they can address.
随着美国退出世界舞台以及多极全球秩序的出现，国际货币体系也可能发生转变 — — 但也许不是转变为以人民币为首的体系。	As the US retreats from the world stage and a multipolar global order emerges, the international monetary system may well be transformed – but probably not into a renminbi-led system.
纳沙泰尔州的许多归化移民，包括选举出来的地方委员出于若干原因保留了自己的外国护照：对欧洲护照持有者来说，这么做能让他们的子女在欧洲学习，让他们自己在欧洲工作。	In Neuchatel, many naturalized citizens, including elected local councilors, retain their foreign passports for several reasons: among European Union passport-holders, doing so allows their children to study in the EU or to work there themselves.
在阿根廷，布宜诺斯艾利斯市长马克里（Mauricio Macri）所属政党（曾经属于保守派，只在首都拥有优势）通过与中左翼的激进党（Radical Party）结盟而转向政治中间派并向各省渗透。	In Argentina, Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri’s party, once conservative and strong only in the capital, has moved both to the political center and the provinces through its alliance with the center-left Radical Party.
在美国的房屋价格和退休储蓄下降而中国的失业人数上升之时，观察家们担心无论美国还是中国都不太愿意削减它们的排放。	With American home values and retirement savings falling and Chinese unemployment numbers rising, observers worry that neither America nor China will have much appetite to cut emissions.
在这15年中，2.5万亿美元用于发展援助的资金以及发展中国家的预算的大头应该用在健康、环境、粮食、水还是教育上？	Should a larger share of the $2.5 trillion that will be directed toward development aid over that period, and of developing-country budgets, be directed toward health, the environment, food, water, or education?
看到国家队赢得世界杯的情景对于大部分国家的公民来说仍然是一个梦想；但他们会追随球队每场比赛的每一秒钟。	Most countries’ citizens do not even dream of seeing their national team win the World Cup; nonetheless, they follow every second of their team’s games.
油仓清洗引发了数量庞大的小规模泄漏事件，而诸如托利峡谷号、埃克森·瓦尔德斯号和圣彼得堡号等油轮事故则导致了大规模集中的原油泄漏。	Tank-washing gave rise to a huge number of small spills, and tanker accidents such as those involving the Torrey Canyon, Exxon Valdez, Metula, and St. Peter resulted in huge, concentrated spills.
该国领导人努力争取中东、日本而后是中国市场准入的工作同样重要，中国现在已经成为新西兰最大的出口市场，在新西兰出口中占据21%的份额。	Equally important was the effort made by the country’s leaders to secure access to growing markets in the Middle East, Japan, and subsequently in China, which is now New Zealand’s largest export market, accounting for 21% of exports.
随着输出国对移民劳动力进行培训，对这些劳动力的需求将会增加，刺激需求方而不是供给方的竞争，从而形成更高工资、更多技能培训的良性循环。	As exporters trained their migrant workforces, demand for their labor would grow and spark competition among venders rather than suppliers, thus fueling a virtuous cycle of higher wages and even more skills training.
当然，从历史的角度看，曾经为结束各成员伯国长达数百年的战争和暴力冲突作出贡献的欧盟现在与欧洲1945年前的表现截然相反。	From a historical point of view, of course, it is clear that the EU, having contributed to ending centuries of war and violent conflict among its member states, nowadays embodies the antithesis of pre-1945 Europe.
如果不能，可以寻求通过大学实验室和小公司提振早期创新作为更有效的替代方案，也许可以采用定向资金支持。	If they cannot, more dramatic alternatives to boost early innovation by university labs and small companies could be sought, perhaps through a targeted fund.
实现这一目标是孟加拉国担任2016年全球移民和发展论坛（GFMD）主席国的主要目标。 12月10—12日，GFMD将在达卡召开第九次年会。	Achieving such an outcome is Bangladesh’s primary objective as Chair of the 2016 Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD), which culminates with the Ninth Annual Forum Meeting in Dhaka on December 10-12.
但不断地采取新措施以至于产生“中国威胁”论需要地区政治领导人（包括中国）用更新、更有创造力的方式解决争端，否则难以避免直接冲突。	But the relentless march of new initiatives to meet the perceived “China threat” will require the region’s political leaders, including the Chinese, to address their disputes in new and more creative ways if that outcome is to be avoided.
厄瓜多尔以惨痛的教训得知，如果打击假消息意味着失去深度、真实的报道和能起到监督作用的媒体，那么这个代价过于高昂。	Ecuador has learned the hard way that if combating misinformation means the loss of in-depth, factual reporting and a media that can play a watchdog role, then the price is too high.
水果和蔬菜含有丰富的微量营养素，其中的一些，包括β胡萝卜素（维生素A的前身 ） 、 维生素C、维生素E和硒，都有可能成为抗氧化剂。	Fruits and vegetables are sources of numerous micronutrients, and some, including b-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A), vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, have potential as antioxidants.
将这一全面的模型应用于丝绸之路工程 — — 特别是通过结合欧洲、中国、俄罗斯和多边机构实现这一点 — — 将能强化现有激励。	Applying this comprehensive model to the Silk Road project – particularly by incorporating Europe, China, Russia, and multilateral institutions – would reinforce existing initiatives.
自由派对于融合移民的难易程度的过度乐观也源自同样的根源：既然社会不过是个体的集合，因此融合根本不是问题。	Liberal over-optimism about the ease of integrating migrants stems from the same source: if society is no more than a collection of individuals, integration is a non-issue.
一些人 — — 首屈一指的要数佛蒙特州参议员伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders ） — —提出了一个偿付者（single-payer）体系。	What some – most vocally, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders – have proposed is a single-payer system.
尽管存在传统干扰者 — — 主要是固有特征，他们中很多人出于政治原因反对和平进程 — — 但我仍相信我们可以让冲突去它应该去的地方 — — 历史书中。	Despite traditional spoilers, mostly of an internal nature, many of whom oppose the process for political reasons, I am confident that we will put this conflict where it belongs – in the history books.
即使美国的石油生产也未能与石油价格的上涨相匹配，这是因为进口工具和设备的成本增加 — — 部分反映了美元的弱势和其他因素 — — 已经迫使许多石油项目被延迟和取消。	Even oil production in the United States has not matched the increase in oil prices, as rising import costs for tools and equipment – partly a reflection of the dollar’s weakness and other factors – have forced project delays and cancellations.
据民意调查显示，战争带来的后果是美国的受拥护程度即便在英国、西班牙和意大利这些政府支持对伊战争的国家也大幅下降。	In the aftermath of the war, polls showed a dramatic decline in the popularity of the US even in countries like Britain, Spain, and Italy, whose governments supported the war.
最后，适应效率（adaptive efficiency，即规则如何变化 ） ， 而不是配置效率（allocative efficiency，当下的规则是否最有效 ） ， 是长期增长的关键。	And, finally, adaptive efficiency (how the rules are changed), not allocative efficiency (the most effective rules right now), is the key to long-term growth.
作为一项松散并且有些模糊的计划，文明联盟旨在通过教育、可行的融合政策以及与媒体更好的对话来治愈伊斯兰与西方之间的冲突所留下的创伤。	A loose and somewhat confused project, the Alliance of Civilizations aims to heal the wounds of conflict between Islam and the West through education, viable integration policies, and a better-informed dialogue with the media.
如果保加利亚将此人遣送回土库曼斯坦—在那里他将会面临某种折磨和死亡威胁—我们口口声声说自己是民主、尊重人权的欧洲的一部分的话也成为空谈。	If Bulgaria sends this man back to Turkmenistan – where he faces certain torture and the threat of a brutal death – our claim to be part of a democratic, rights-respecting Europe will ring hollow.
至于已经实际执行的死刑 — — 四年中总共执行了两起 — — 按照客观标准确定相关犯罪比那些没有执行死刑的犯罪更加“罕见”或令人发指几乎没有可能。	As for the death sentences that have already been carried out – two in that four-year period – it is impossible to ascertain the objective criteria that made the crimes in question more heinous or “rarer” than those that did not merit execution.
更重要的是，去年一年，公债/GDP比率在意大利上升了七个百分点，在爱尔兰上升了11个百分点，在葡萄牙和西班牙上升了15个百分点。	More significant, over the last year, the public debt/GDP ratio rose by seven percentage points in Italy, 11 in Ireland, and 15 in Portugal and Spain.
委员会对拉脱维亚2008－2012国家分配计划（NAP）的决定，留给拉脱维亚的二氧化碳排放量配额只达到该国要求的55 % 。	The Commission’s decision on Latvia’s National Allocation Plan (NAP) for 2008-2012 left only 55% of the CO2 emissions that Latvia requested.
换言之，他们在打击巴基斯坦塔利班时寻求美国和阿富汗的帮助，同时却坚定不移地协助阿富汗塔利班杀害阿富汗人和北约部队。	In other words, they seek the help of Afghanistan and the US to fight the Pakistani Taliban while unflinchingly aiding the Afghan Taliban, which has been killing Afghan and NATO troops.
这是深度脱碳方案计划（DDPP）的主要宗旨，该计划已经动员16个最大温室气体排放国的研究团队制定截止本世纪中叶的国家深度脱碳方案。	This is the main message of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP), which has mobilized research teams in 16 of the largest greenhouse-gas emitters to prepare national Deep Decarbonization Pathways to mid-century.
但是戈登忽略了保持美国创新全球领导地位的最大威胁：在过去一代人的岁月中国家丧失了作为经济行动者的合法性。	But Gordon ignores the greatest threat to continued US global leadership in innovation: the delegitimation over the past generation of the state’s role as an economic actor.
当然这个宣言中还有很多其他内容 — — 比如复兴中世纪圣殿骑士团的梦想 — — 体现了他本人的怪异思维，而怀德斯则迅速与布雷维克的暴力方式撇清关系。	Of course, there was much else in the manifesto – fantasies about reviving the medieval Knights Templar, for example – that suggests a more bizarre disposition, and Wilders was quick to distance himself from Breivik’s violent methods.
为公平贸易标签支付更多的钱并不比为Gucci品牌多付钱更为“非市场化 ” ， 而且它反映的是更好的伦理取向。	Paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more “anti-market” than paying more for a Gucci label, and it reflects better ethical priorities.
第一次是在一个世纪前，当时信心的保证是黄金；后一次是在最近的全球化浪潮中，这回信心的基础是人类智慧解决政策难题的能力。	In the first, a century ago, confidence was underpinned by gold; in the more recent wave of globalization, it depended upon the power of the human intellect to solve policy problems.
伊朗及其支持者所做出的反应 — — 不仅德黑兰、而且伊拉克和巴林均爆发了针对沙特的暴力抗议活动并洗劫了该国使馆 — — 不过是向外界展示了两国的仇恨有多深。	The reaction of Iran and its supporters – with violent anti-Saudi protests not only in Tehran, where the kingdom’s embassy was sacked, but also in Iraq and Bahrain – merely revealed the full depth of the underlying bilateral enmity.
但是，我出席了17次会议中的16次（错过了第一届 ） ， 我的感觉是2016年中国发展论坛对于中国所面临的艰巨经济挑战来说具有特别丰富的战略含义。	But, having attended 16 of the 17 meetings (I missed the first one), my sense is that CDF 2016 was especially rich in its strategic implications for China’s daunting economic challenges.
埃尔多安第一个这样的决策目的是促成叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德政权的垮台，因此他容忍包括伊斯兰国新成员在内的战斗部队跨越土耳其南部边界进入叙利亚而几乎不采取任何举措。	Erdoğan’s first such decision, motivated by his desire to see Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime collapse, was to allow fighters, including recruits for the Islamic State, to cross Turkey’s southern border into Syria relatively freely.
同样重要的，是可以让一个领导人在不同的情况中变换这些不同的技巧，从而产生成功组合的被我称为“聪明能力”的情景智力。	Equally important is the contextual intelligence that allows a leader to vary the mix of these skills in different situations to produce the successful combinations that I call “smart power.”
采用最佳的施工方法可以释放出巨额价值：目前的状况是，类似项目的标价在不同国家可以相差50%到100%之多。	Meeting best practices could unlock huge value: as it stands, the price tags for similar projects can vary by 50-100% from country to country.
我对20世纪80年代末仍然记忆犹新，这不仅是因为那时对自由的期待，而且因为对我刚出生的女儿来说，一点儿婴儿食品都没有。	I remember the late 1980’s not only for its hopes for freedom, but also for a total absence of baby food for my newborn daughter.
受益于中国的高储蓄率，2015年底中国银行系统贷款与存款之比为74 % ， 存在央行的法定准备金率高达17.4 % 。	Thanks to China’s high saving rate, the country’s banking system had a loan-to-deposit ratio of 74% at the end of 2015, with 17.5% in required reserves held at the central bank.
对于PAS，是否能够保持政治重要性取决于能否克服马哈蒂尔和从其自身衍生的、由亲安瓦尔的温和派组成的诚信党（Amanah）所造成的威胁。	As for the PAS, its continued political relevance hinges on eliminating the threat posed by Mahathir and its own splinter party, Amanah, formed by pro-Anwar moderates.
欧盟是基于能够吸引28个国家加入其中的普世价值观和原则；尽管发生了英国退欧，仍有六个国家正在努力加入其中。	The European Union is based on universal values and principles that are so attractive that 28 countries have opted to join it; and, Brexit notwithstanding, some half-dozen more are trying to get in.
事实上，子孙后代能够比当前一代从政府基础设施投资中获得更多好处，因此让他们来出基础设施的大头也是合理的。	In fact, future generations will benefit more than the current one from government infrastructure investment, so it is reasonable that they should pay for most for it.
这使很多观察家认为世界最富有的国家在对外援助方面一般也最吝啬啬比起花在战争和国防上面的经费就更是如此。	This led many observers to reflect on the fact that the world’s richest country was in general the most miserly in foreign assistance – all the more so in comparison to the amount it spends on war and defense.
通过监管和行政指导，银行、保险公司和退基金进被迫大量增加政府债务的持有比例，远远高出自愿选择情形时的水平。	Through regulation and administrative directives, banks, insurance companies, and pension funds are being forced to hold much higher shares of government debt than they might voluntarily choose to do.
但一个反覆无常的政客一夜之间颠覆建立已久的结构和机制是非常困难的，如果这不是为了更加根本性的变化的话。	But it would be very difficult for an erratic politician suddenly to overturn long-established structures and mechanisms, were it not for a more fundamental economic shift.
由此得出， GDP 将在 2009 年增加 1200 亿美元， 2010 年增加 1800 亿美元 。 。 。 ” 2011 年增加 600 亿美元。	[Thus,] GDP would be higher than otherwise by $120 billion in 2009 and $180 billion in 2010...,” and by $60 billion in 2011.
在最近与CPJ的会面中，厄瓜多尔通信部长米切莱纳（Andrés Michelena）说政府计划在今年改革厄瓜多尔通讯法。	And in a recent meeting with the CPJ, Ecuadorian Secretary of Communication Andrés Michelena said the government plans to reform the Ecuadorian Communications Law this year.
所以正如保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman ） 、 马丁·沃尔夫（Martin Wolf）和其他人一样，我会支持扩大财政赤字，而不是缩小。	So, like Paul Krugman, Martin Wolf, and others, I would expand fiscal deficits, not try to shrink them.
"例如， 欧盟共同渔业政策就是""通过调节海上捕捞数量、允许鱼苗繁殖和保证此类政策被切实执行来保护渔源 "" 。"	"For example, the avowed intention of the EU Common Fisheries Policy is ""to protect fish resources by regulating the amount of fish taken from the sea, by allowing young fish to reproduce , and by ensuring that measures are respected."""
对于初次接触以巴冲突的人来说，我们实际上又再次进入了前美国国务卿亨利·基辛格所谓的“建设性分歧”的范畴中。	For starters, we are again moving into what Henry Kissinger called the realm of “constructive ambiguity.”
支持央行独立的第一个理由是，若非如此，政客可以在选举期间利用扩张性货币政策的积极短期效应而不顾及它的长期通胀性后果。	The first argument in favor of central-bank independence is that, without it, politicians can exploit expansionary monetary policy’s positive short-run effects at election time, without regard for its long-run inflationary consequences.
但政府和政治领袖可以也 应该支持作为自由社会基础的共同价值观 — — 罗尔斯称之位“重叠的共识 ” 。	But governments and political leaders can and should advocate the shared values – what Rawls called the “overlapping consensus” – that define a liberal society.
在这样的背景下，世界卫生组织新任总干事泰德罗斯·杰贝耶斯拥有独一无二的机会进行人们所迫切需要的改革。	Against this backdrop, the World Health Organization (WHO), under its new Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, has a unique opportunity to pursue urgently needed reforms.
加利福尼亚州门洛帕克 — — 许多政府对有关虚假信息、错误信息和宣传运动的担忧已经到了促使他们推动全新立法的程度。	MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA – Concern about the proliferation of disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda has reached the point where many governments are proposing new legislation.
9月，联大召开了两次高级别会议 — — 其中一次是探讨终结结核病（TB ） ， 而另外一次则是讨论抗击非传染性疾病（NCDs）的议题。	In September, the United Nations General Assembly convened two high-level meetings – one on ending tuberculosis (TB), and the other on fighting noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).
分子生物学是解决卫生、环境和食品问题（就像人们在肯尼亚所看到的）的良方，问题在于决策者是否做好了使用准备。	GM foods have now been on the market in the US for more than 12 years. Most of the food consumed by Americans is either genetically modified or exposed to genetic modification somewhere in the production process.
虽说以色列和巴勒斯坦人在两国制方案中拥有共同的利益，但由于双方利益差别太大，因此在同一问题上常常提出截然相反的诉求。	But, if Israelis and Palestinians share a vital interest in a two-state solution, they have very different interests, and therefore mean very different things when referring to the same issues.
与内贾德的改革派前任哈塔米不同，鲁哈尼与哈梅内伊合作紧密，而哈塔米看起来更像是反对派领袖，而不是执政者。	Unlike Ahmadinejad’s reformist predecessor, Mohammad Khatami, who acted more like the leader of the loyal opposition than head of the executive, Rouhani has worked closely with Khamenei.
埃尔多安即将面临他自己制定的三个总理任期时限，他想修改土耳其宪法，引入总统制 — — 由他自己领导第一任内阁，获得远比现在更大的权力。	Facing the end of a self-imposed three-term limit as prime minister, he is intent on changing the Turkish constitution to introduce a presidential system – with himself on top as the first incumbent to wield much-enlarged power.
崇拜自由贸易神坛的人 — — 包括我在内 — — 必须认识这一显而易见的“断线 ” （ disconnect ） 。	Those who worship at the altar of free trade – including me – must come to grips with this glaring disconnect.
虽然一众西方和亚洲领导人都发誓会无视美国超出自身国境范围的制裁行为 — — 这针对的是与伊朗有业务往来的第三方，但在协议签署后投资伊朗的外国公司已经开始陆续撤出该国。	While Western and Asian leaders have vowed to defy America’s extraterritorial sanctions – which target third parties that do business with Iran – foreign firms that invested in Iran after the JCPOA was signed have begun withdrawing from the country.
如今，亚洲地区最大的国家 — — 中国、印度、日本和美国 — — 有望形成堪与给十九世纪给欧洲带来近一百年和平的体系相媲美的合作体系。	It is now possible for Asia’s greatest powers – China, India, Japan, and the US – to form something akin to the concert system that gave Europe a century of almost complete peace in the nineteenth century.
随着新闻神秘性的逐渐消褪，任何人都可以成为一位平民记者或评论家，管制或者培训所有“即将上岗”的记者绝不是解决办法。	As the journalistic priesthood erodes and everyone can become a citizen reporter or commentator, regulating or training all would-be journalists is not the answer.
许多决策者认为，澳大利亚担任二十国集团主席国是一次重振和精炼该集团刺激全球增长、创造就业岗位和提高生活水平的使命的机会。	And many policymakers view Australia’s G-20 chairmanship as an opportunity to re-energize and refine the group’s mission to boost global growth, create jobs, and raise living standards.
比如，地区性青蒿素耐药性计划致力于阻止耐青蒿素疟疾在湄公河三角洲地区的传播。 该计划监控和共享耐药性数据，推广抗疟疾疗法的合理使用。	For example, the Regional Artemisinin-Resistance Initiative is working to halt the spread of resistant malaria in the Mekong Delta region, by monitoring and sharing drug-resistance data and promoting proper use of antimalarial treatments.
互联网的创造者 — — 他们属于一个封闭的小圈子 — — 对安全并非主要顾虑的开放系统感到十分满意。	The Internet’s creators, part of a small, enclosed community, were very comfortable with an open system in which security was not a primary concern.
现在或许看上去有悖常理，但欧洲的生产率下降和劳动人口缩减预示着今后经济难度将进一步加大，因此有必要改革欧盟的效率和民主响应能力。	It may look counter-intuitive, but Europe's falling productivity and shrinking workforce signal even tougher times ahead and strengthen the case for an EU that is more efficient, as well as more democratically responsive.
武断地为各国设置预算平衡的四年大限而不考虑各国在经济周期中所处的阶段是无济于事的：无法实施的目标没有任何意义。	A dogmatic target of budgetary balance four years hence, irrespective of a country’s position in the economic cycle, would achieve little: targets are meaningless if they are impossible to implement.
但他立刻说明一个事实“每一个投资者都欺骗自己说他们的资产是可流动的（虽然如果所有投资者想要变现的话，资产就不可能变现。 ）有了这样的前提，他们就可以放心来进行更为大胆的冒险行为 。 ”	But he immediately drew back: the fact “that each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is ‘liquid’ (though this cannot be true for all investors collectively) calms his nerves and makes him much more willing to run a risk...”
但在这个法定货币的世界里（中央银行可以随意印制钞票 ） ， 一但各界对央行失去信心就会削弱长期的经济表现，因为大家在某种程度上都担心通货膨胀。	But lack of confidence in central banks in a world of fiat money (where central banks can create money at will) weakens long-term economic performance, owing partly to fears of inflation.
柏林 — — 尽管今年8月俄罗斯入侵格鲁吉亚造成的紧张局势仍在持续，欧盟还是将就一项新的伙伴与合作协议（PCA）重新开启与俄罗斯的对话。	BERLIN – Despite continuing tensions over Russia’s invasion of Georgia this August, the European Union will reopen talks with Russia on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA).
出于这个原因，有必要问一问，像德国这样的大国 — — 甚或像加州或得州这样的大州 — — 增加还是减少了全球总需求。	For this reason, it is relevant to ask whether a country as large as Germany – or even a large state like California or Texas – augments or depletes global aggregate demand.
当今，越来越多的问题正被重新定义为“症”或“病 ” 。 它们被认为是由遗传的易患病体质和生物化学失衡引起的。	Nowadays, more and more problems are being redefined as “disorders” or “illnesses,” supposedly caused by genetic predispositions and biochemical imbalances.
12月，中国由国家经营的人民日报在推特 和脸书上发帖欢迎特朗普的假新闻口头禅，强调它“揭露了与西方媒体有关的更大真相 。 ”	In December, China’s state-run People’s Daily newspaper posted tweets and a Facebook post welcoming Trump’s fake news mantra, noting that it “speaks to a larger truth about Western media.”
伦齐的领导力也以类似的方式遭到挫败：他把自己的政治生命押宝于就急需的宪政改革的全民公投上，结果，这场公投变成了对其政府的评估。	Renzi’s leadership, too, was brought down in similar fashion: by tying his political fate to a referendum on much-needed constitutional reforms, he turned the vote into an assessment of his government.
历史上，少数群体承担着中东与外部世界联系桥梁的作用，如果他们消失了，中东地区也将失去重要的文化、经济和知识领导者阶层。	Minorities have historically served as brokers between the Middle East and the outside world, and if they disappear, the region will lose an important class of cultural, economic, and intellectual leaders.
当务之急的第三大改革是联合国治理，首先应该从安理会入手，安理会的组成已无法反映全球地缘政治的现实状况。	The third major reform imperative is the UN’s governance, starting with the Security Council, the composition of which no longer reflects global geopolitical realities.
但是，在英国退出的情况下，未来一体化已不再是欧洲最大的担忧，相反，欧盟必须与日益强大的破坏既有一体化成就、试图让欧洲开倒车的力量角力。	But, in the wake of Brexit, future integration is not Europe’s biggest concern. Instead, it must contend with the increasingly powerful forces undermining the integration that has been achieved, attempting to push Europe backward.
Facebook在社交领域取代MySpace以及苹果逆袭智能手机市场就是明证，层出不穷的新服务和市场亦然。	Witness how Facebook overtook MySpace in social networks, or how Apple upended the market for smartphones – or how new services and markets are constantly being invented.
借助主办美国最大的海外军事基地为自己和卡塔尔提供保护，他的目的是从沙特等区域第三方手中争夺控制权。 若非如此，沙特等国就有可能控制这些海湾小国。	Protecting himself and Qatar by hosting the largest American military base outside the United States, his strategy has been to wrest control from regional third parties who might otherwise dominate the smaller Gulf states.
格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案的目的是为了预防商业银行用储户的钱去赌博，因此该法案强制将零售银行业务和投资银行业务分离。	Glass-Steagall aimed to prevent commercial banks from gambling with their depositors’ money by mandating the institutional separation of retail and investment banking.
不过，讽刺的是，布雷顿森林体系的终结并没有动摇美元在国际上的主导地位，实际上反而增加了美元在世界范围的使用。	Ironically, however, rather than undermining the predominant international role of the US dollar, the end of Bretton Woods actually boosted its use around the world.
因此，不难预见，托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）的《二十一世纪资本论 》 （ Capital in the Twenty-First Century）一时洛阳纸贵。	So, predictably, Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century has been a big hit.
美联储可能“逐步减少”其量化宽松（QE）等迹象让投资者争相降低新兴市场风险敞口，导致新兴市场货币大幅贬值、股价崩盘。	Indications that the US Federal Reserve might “taper” its quantitative easing (QE) drove investors to reduce their exposure to emerging markets, sharply weakening their currencies and causing their equity prices to tumble.
问题不仅在于课程的传统内容，如数学、科学和语言上，也在于缺乏重要的“软”技能，如沟通、团队合作和解决问题。	The trouble goes beyond traditional components of the curriculum, like math, science, and language. There is also a deficiency in critical “soft” skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem solving.
在这方面，最显著的例子莫过于TPP，该条约几乎肯定将构成所有签约国保护 — — 甚至形成 — — 中产阶级的最大单一障碍。	There is no clearer example of this than the TPP, which almost certainly constitutes the single biggest threat to the preservation – or creation – of any signatory country’s middle class.
根据历史学家道格拉斯·欧文（Douglas Irwin）的记录，一个显著的意外是瑞典经济学家卡塞尔（Gustav Cassel ） ， 在1928年的一系列剑桥大学讲座中，卡塞尔警告了“世界性的长期萧条 ” 。	As the historian Douglas Irwin has documented, a major exception was the Swedish economist Gustav Cassel. In a series of lectures at Columbia University in 1928, Cassel warned of “a prolonged and worldwide depression.”
虽然一切都还只是规划蓝图，但两地的承诺相结合标志着该区域能源规划正向着更环保，更清洁的技术方面实现重大转变。	Blueprints are still being formulated, but taken together the two countries’ commitments mark a major shift in regional energy planning toward greener, cleaner technologies.
在这块拥有超过30个中小规模国家和5亿人口的大陆上是无法通行好几套左右逢源的“意大利面碗”式协定的。	A “spaghetti bowl” of different à la carte arrangements would not work for a continent of more than 30 small and medium-size countries and more than 500 million people.
另一个则是共和党人在2010年夺取了国会多数席位后阻挠了进一步刺激政策的实施，无视美国经济恰恰在2011~14 年急需更多基础设施建设支出和合理减税政策的事实。	Another was the efforts of the Republicans, who secured a majority in Congress in 2010, to block further stimulus, even though more infrastructure spending and well-designed tax cuts were precisely what the US economy needed in 2011-2014.
这些国际经济承诺往往不是为了解决国内民主失败问题，而是为了企业或经济利益，还会破坏国内社会的讨价还价机制。	Too often, international economic commitments serve not to fix democratic failures at home, but to privilege corporate or financial interests and undermine domestic social bargains.
此外 ， “ 安静”并非战略目标，以色列追求它的方式 — — 两三年打一次仗 — — 也并不令人信服。	Moreover, “quiet” is not a strategic goal; nor is Israel’s way of pursuing it – a war every two or three years – particularly convincing.
普京身边的外交官们出于自身的教化，可能会认为采用老的苏联时代的做法理所当然，并可能认为洗雪往日耻辱的时候到了。	The diplomats surrounding Putin may find it natural, given their training, to apply the old Soviet-era methods, and may believe that the moment has come to undo yesterday’s humiliation.
布什政府感觉被法国在联合国的外交手段背叛了，而法国总统希拉克则更坚定了他对单一超级大国的不信任，并且呼吁建立一个多极世界。	The Bush Administration felt betrayed by French diplomatic tactics at the United Nations, while French President Jacques Chirac felt confirmed in his mistrust of the sole superpower and his call for a multipolar world.
最近关于中国经济规模可能很快会比肩美国的论断也令该意愿进一步高涨，导致许多人相信 — — 不管是悲凄地还是欣喜地 — — 人民币很快会一统天下了。	Recent speculation that China’s economy may soon be as large as America’s has boosted this interest further, causing many to believe – whether ruefully or gleefully – that the renminbi will soon dominate.
有时，城市可能正在迈向“伟大城市”的途中，应该允许市场力量驱逐不能充分参与到这一伟大进程的低收入人群，为有能力的人让路。	In some cases, a city may be on its way to becoming a “great city,” and market forces should be allowed to drive out lower-income people who can’t participate fully in this greatness to make way for those who can.
人们希望得到清洁能源，技术不难获得并且有利可图，而在数百万人缺少可靠电力的情况下，可再生资源的出现不啻久旱逢甘霖。	People want clean energy, the technologies are available and profitable, and, with millions of people lacking access to reliable power, the emergence of renewable sources is a lifesaver.
受调查的爱尔兰人中总共有82%相信爱尔兰已经因为是欧盟成员国而收获良多。 这是欧洲各国中的最高比例，平均值是54 % 。	A total of 82% of Irish people surveyed earlier this year believed Ireland had benefited from EU membership, the highest score in Europe, where the average was 54%.
俄罗斯用武力改变欧洲边境，违反了国际关系最基本的准则；它还视图影响2016年美国总统大选，这侵犯了美国的主权。	Russia violated the most basic norm of international relations when it used armed force to change borders in Europe, and it violated US sovereignty through its efforts to influence the 2016 election.
美国剑桥—2001年，高盛的吉姆·奥尼尔（Jim O’Neil）提出了著名的金砖四国（BRIC）一词来形容世界上最大的四个发展中经济体 — — 巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国。	CAMBRIDGE – In 2001, Goldman Sachs’ Jim O’Neill famously coined the term BRIC to characterize the world’s four largest developing economies – Brazil, Russia, India, and China.
在满足过渡到一个更正常的欧盟存在的条件之前，国际高级代表办公室(OHR)必须继续存在下去 — — 或者建立一个��样有力的机构。	It has to remain open - or a similarly strong organization set up - until the conditions for the transition to a more normal EU presence are met.
相反，监督委员会最近批准了一项新财政计划，并与波多黎各紧急利息基金公司（COFINA）所发债券的持有人签订了协议，有可能让波多黎各永远被债务所紧紧束缚。	On the contrary, the oversight board recently certified a new fiscal plan and a deal with holders of bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Urgent Interest Fund Corporation (COFINA) that could put the island in a debt straitjacket indefinitely.
确实，阿拉伯国家都既开发又使用过化学和生物武器 — — 到目前为止还不是用它们来攻击以色列，而是攻击该地区的其他人。	Indeed, Arab states have both developed and used chemical and biological weapons – not against Israel, so far, but against others in the region.
彼此妥协则双方都能各得其所，既能让政府承诺减少支出，又能采取一系列步骤来使税收具有更多的社会正义性。	A compromise would allow both parties to declare partial victory, for it would likely entail commitments to cut spending and some steps to make taxation more socially just.
因此，在《不扩散核武器条约》之外还存在巨大的核扩散障碍，所以没有理由认为，如果伊朗建造自己的核武器这些障碍就不存在了。	Large barriers to nuclear proliferation thus exist independent of the NPT. There is no reason to believe that they would fall if Iran built its own weapon.
据Palais Royal Initiative报告，提高SDR全球地位的关键是通过“在适当保障机制下定期配置SDR”甚至在“特殊情况下”配置SDR。	According to a Palais Royal Initiative report, a key way to raise the SDR’s global standing is through “regular allocations of SDRs under appropriate safeguards” or even allocations “in exceptional circumstances.”
李总统计划的其他要素还包括建设生态友好的运输网络，例如高速铁路以及几百公里长的自行车车道，并且从垃圾堆中利用甲烷来制造能源。	Other elements of Lee’s plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks, such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks, and generating energy using waste methane from landfills.
全球人口将在2050年达到九十亿，而发展中世界的人口 — — 增量人口几乎全部来自这里 — — 正在追求更多样化的饮食。	The global population is set to reach nine billion by 2050, while people in the developing world – where nearly all of the population growth will occur – are seeking more varied diets.
例如，苏莱马尼亚糖厂在八十年代的两伊战争期间遭到轰炸，但是该单位的员工从那时以来一直领取工资，尽管现在只有老鼠和鸽子在那里报到上班。	For example, the Sulaymaniyah Sugar Mill was bombed during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980’s, but its employees have been paid ever since, though only rats and pigeons now report for work there.
这就暴露出一个问题：任何国家都不可能拥有足够的发展速度，足以在将50%的GDP重新投资的情况下最终避免遭遇巨大的产能过剩和令人忧心的不良贷款问题。	The problem, of course, is that no country can be productive enough to reinvest 50% of GDP in new capital stock without eventually facing immense overcapacity and a staggering non-performing loan problem.
幸运的是，由我担任委员之一的全球教育机会融资国际委员会（International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity）帮助制定了一个解决方案。	Fortunately, the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, where I serve as a commissioner, has helped to develop a solution.
西方国家、土耳其和多数阿拉伯国家被残酷的杀戮和破坏活动所激怒，干预并加强国际制裁的压力正在逐渐累积。	The Western countries, Turkey, and most of the Arab world are incensed by the brutal killing and destruction, and pressure to intervene and stiffen international sanctions is building.
银行家和金融家也受到了类似的指责，人们普遍认为他们的话同样没有说服力，因为目的都是为了追求本行业的狭隘私利。	A similar charge is made against bankers and other financiers, who, widely perceived to be arguing from narrow sectoral self-interest, were equally unpersuasive.
它可能仍旧掌权，但其实力正迅速下降，正如戴维·卡梅伦（David Cameron ） 、 欧洲的社会民主主义者、欧盟委员会、希拉里·克林顿，甚至希腊被注资援助后的激进左翼联盟政府所展现的那样。	It may still be in power, but its stock is falling fast, as David Cameron, Europe’s social democrats, Hillary Clinton, the European Commission, and even Greece’s post-capitulation Syriza government can attest.
而一个更能说明问题的举动则是哈尼耶最近建议将哈马斯和伊斯兰圣战运动整合起来，继续从加沙向以色列平民目标发动火箭袭击。	In a further telling move, Haniyeh also recently suggested merging Hamas with the Islamic Jihad movement, which continues to target Israeli civilians with rockets fired from Gaza.
马里、乍得、尼日尔、中非共和国、索马里、肯尼亚甚至埃塞俄比亚都饱受极端主义蔓延的困扰或面临尖锐的焦虑。	Mali, Chad, Niger, the Central African Republic, Somalia, Kenya, and even Ethiopia have all suffered or face acute anxieties about the spread of extremism.
在像美国这样的国家，在过去25年里，中产阶级从全球化中得到的好处非常少，所以贸易政策有非常大的压力要对此提供一些补偿。	In countries like the US, where the middle class has reaped few of the benefits of globalization in the last quarter-century, trade policy will be under severe pressure to provide some redress.
随着伊拉克人民渐渐走上一条颇具挑战性的民主之路，越来越多的北约国家已经同意通过资金或设备以及建立战争学院和国防大学来帮��伊拉克人训练安全部队。	As the Iraqi people take more steps along the challenging road to democracy, more NATO countries have agreed to help train Iraqi security personnel by providing funds or equipment and by establishing a war college and military academies.
只要外部需求持续上涨 — — 近期中国和美国在此方面的数字增长就是一个积极信号 — — 欧洲出口就应该能继续表现良好。	So long as external demand holds up – and recent growth numbers from China and the US are positive in this regard – Europe’s exports should continue to perform well.
2017年11月，我所在大学的抗生素耐药性研究中心（CARe）举办了这一话题的首次大型研讨会，经济学、伦理学、法律、政策、社会科学和卫生等领域的著名学者齐聚一堂。	Then, in November 2017, the Centre for Antibiotic Resistance Research (CARe) at my own university held the first-ever major symposium on the topic, bringing together leading scholars in economics, ethics, law, policy, social science, and health care.
考虑到亚洲的“国际货币基金组织污名 ” ， 一个可以在不预设政策前提的情况下向合资格的成员国提供预先信贷额度的联合援助实体将非常有用。	Given the “IMF stigma” in Asia, a co-financing facility that provides precautionary credit lines without policy conditionality to qualified member countries would be useful.
这些改革措施虽然重要但影响却相对有限，只能将劳动力对未来经济增长的贡献从战后水平的五分之一提升至三分之一。	These changes, while important, would have a limited impact, lifting labor’s contribution to future growth from one-fifth to only one-third of post-war levels.
中国这样的国家，它的高储蓄率超过了本地投资需要，可以支持储蓄较少的世界其他地区的投资，特别是低收入的非洲和亚洲地区。	A country such as China, with a high saving rate that exceeds local investment needs, can support investment in other parts of the world that save less, notably low-income Africa and Asia.
在强有力的政策缺位的情况下，人们很���易想到恐怖情形：一蹶不振的产出和金融体系中的问题相互交织，使得产出进一步大幅下降。	In the absence of strong policies, it is too easy to think of scary scenarios in which depressed output and troubles in the financial system feed on each other, leading to further large drops in output.
但即使评级不再受到法律的强制和鼓励，对评级的需求 — — 以及提高评级可靠性的必要性 — — 依然会存在下去。	Even if ratings were no longer required or encouraged by law, however, demand for ratings – and the need to improve their reliability – would remain.
“以眼还眼”要求只把犯罪者本人作为目标，而不要波及无辜，如果说那些无辜者有罪，那么他们唯一的过错就是与罪犯沾亲带故。	“An eye for an eye” asks that the culprit should be the sole target, and not others, whose only crime was to be related to him.
有些一年前表现出可贵公众精神的人开始感到一旦进入政府，他们就无法在经济停滞的状态下维护法律的尊严，因为最不朽的原则也经不起政府的打磨。	Some who a year ago displayed great public spirit came to feel, when in government, that they could not vindicate the supremacy of law without curtailing economic growth.
但是，向腐败官员宣战和加紧旨在打破中国精英自肥式统治的深层改革难免会让习近平与中国政治和经济精英产生冲突。	But waging war on corrupt officials and pressing for deep reforms aimed at dismantling China’s kleptocracy will inevitably bring Xi into conflict with China’s political and economic elites.
尽管大多数经济学家都对特朗普在贸易平衡方面的无知惊讶不已，但其中许多人也普遍赞同他在知识产权方面的指控。	While most economists marvel at Trump’s ignorance of how trade balances work, many broadly agree with his charges regarding intellectual property (IP).
为了实现数字经济的潜力，并避免其可能的弊端，中国需要构建公正包容的社会制度来保护产权及确保有效的市场。	The only way to harness the digital economy’s potential while avoiding downside risks is to build fair and inclusive social institutions that protect property rights and ensure efficient markets.
在这方面，墨西哥总统涅托的超越党派的“墨西哥契约 ” （ Pact for Mexico）可以作为有用的榜样。	To this end, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s cross-party “Pact for Mexico” could serve as a useful model.
股权价格和其他风险资产的价格自2007年下半年达到最高点以来急剧下降，但是依然还存在大幅下降的风险。	Equity prices and other risky assets have fallen sharply from their peaks of late 2007, but there are still significant downside risks.
在埃尔多安即将到来的任期中，问题还将保持：这些实际的 — — 因此也是暂时的 — — 约束是否能成为巩固民主制度的强有力的保证的曙光？	Throughout Erdoğan’s coming term, the question will nonetheless remain: Can these practical – and thus ephemeral – constraints serve as even a minimal proxy for the robust guarantees of a consolidated democratic system?
五年前，为应对全球金融危机，中国放宽了信贷配额和对地方政府基础设施项目（通常由国企执行）的规划控制。	A decade later, in response to the global financial crisis, China loosened credit quotas and planning controls on SOE-run local-government infrastructure projects.
虽然许多吸烟者很晚才发现该行业如此劣行，但在法律诉讼中发现的档案表明该行业一直协同发力攻击公共卫生科学及科学家，以规避政府监管。	Though discovery of these efforts has come too late for many tobacco smokers, documents unearthed in lawsuits have revealed concerted efforts to avoid the imposition of government regulation by attacking public health science and scientists.
但最最重要的无疑是生物燃料 — — 这种人类最古老的燃料占当前可再生能源总量的76%及能源总量的10 % 。	But the most important by far is biomass – humanity’s oldest fuel makes up 76% of today’s renewable energy and 10% of all energy.
因为女性缺乏经验，其首要角色是看护者，其谈判风格尚不为人所接受，且旧歧视顽固不化，这些都能解释性别差异。	Lack of experience, primary caregiver responsibilities, bargaining style, and plain old discrimination all help to explain the gender gap.
有些罗马尼亚官员，包括总统特拉扬·伯塞斯库，一直在讨论向占总人口四分之一的多达百万摩尔多瓦公民颁发罗马尼亚护照。	Some Romanian officials, including President Traian Basescu, have bandied about the idea of distributing Romanian passports to as many as a million Moldovan citizens, a quarter of the entire population.
华沙 — — 拥有欧洲（实际是整个经合组织）最佳经济记录的政府怎会遭到怀疑欧洲、奉行民族主义且不懂经济的反对党的羞辱 — — 短短一年前人们还认为反对党不可能在选举中获胜。	WARSAW – How can a government with the best economic record in Europe (indeed in the entire OECD) be humiliated at the polls by a Euroskeptic, nationalistic, and economically illiterate opposition – one deemed unelectable only a year ago?
即使高涨的复苏大潮的确能像保守派经济学家所说的那样让所有船只浮起来，但也不足以让众多船只摆脱民粹主义所掀起的风暴。	Even if the rising tide of recovery does lift all boats, as conservative economists like to say, it will not be enough to push many vessels clear of populist tempests.
据说发表在美国国家经济研究局的工作文件比发表在期刊上的更加权威，但该机构并未要求学者在其网站上公布其数据和研究程序。	It is said that NBER working papers are even more prestigious than publication in refereed journals. Yet the Bureau does not require scholars to post their data and programs to its Web site as a condition for working-paper publication.
但不论税收法案是否能通过协调过程并成为法律，大消息不会改变：盎格鲁-萨克逊式代议制民主陷入了严重的麻烦。	But, regardless of whether the tax bill survives the reconciliation process and becomes law, the big news won’t change: the Anglo-Saxon model of representative government is in serious trouble.
两年时间能使市场看清西班牙银行是否有能力应对地产价格下滑的问题，或者抵押贷款违约是否会导致银行大规模破产，迫使西班牙政府注入巨额存款保证金。	Two years could allow markets to see whether Spain’s banks can handle the decline of local real-estate prices, or whether mortgage defaults will lead to widespread bank failures, requiring the Spanish government to finance large deposit guarantees.
欧洲央行绝不会允许塞浦路斯的银行通过支付高于市场的利率来吸引巨额存款并把所有鸡蛋都放在一个篮子（希腊）里。	The European Central Bank would never have allowed Cypriot banks to attract huge deposits by paying above-market interest rates, and then to put all of their eggs in one basket (Greece).
在最初的10年，移居者总数可能会在150万到4百万之间，即占新成员国总人口的2.4%至5 % - -现欧盟总人口的极小一部分。	Over the first decade, the cumulative number of migrants might amount to between 1.5 and four million, that is, 2.4% to 5% of the total population in the new member states - and a tiny fraction of the total population in the current Union.
因此，欧洲央行关于TARGET2失衡恶化的解释 — — 这主要是欧洲央行自身大规模债券购买计划的间接后果 — — 似乎比将它归因于资本外逃更加合理。	The ECB’s explanation of the increase in TARGET2 imbalances – that it is mainly an indirect consequence of the ECB’s own vast bond-purchase program – thus seems much more reasonable than attributing it to capital flight.
委内瑞拉对PDVSA的供应商、承包商和合资企业合作商违约，导致其石油出口较1997年下降了45 % ， 2012年产量只有2005年所制定的计划产量的一半。	Venezuela has defaulted on PDVSA’s suppliers, contractors, and joint-venture partners, causing oil exports to fall by 45% relative to 1997 and production to amount to about half what the 2005 plan had projected for 2012.
悲观者已经看到了20世纪90年代末亚洲危机的重演，甚至2008—2009年发达国家危机在新兴市场的重演。	Pessimists are already seeing a replay of the late-1990’s Asian crisis or, worse, an emerging-market echo of the 2008-2009 crisis in the advanced countries.
埃及的例子能让整整一代贷款人警醒并冷静下来。 他们还不习惯于考虑这类风险，甚至可能没怎么听说过恶意债务的说法。	An Egyptian precedent would bring awareness and sobriety to an entire generation of lenders that is not accustomed to considering this type of risk, and that may even be unfamiliar with the doctrine of odious debt.
可能我已经忘却了现任布什总统前任们第二任期内的艰难，但是，布什目前自身的困境表明，这一宪法限制本身也存在问题。	Perhaps I had forgotten the travails of President George W. Bush’s predecessors in their second term, but his own current predicament shows that the constitutional limit has its own problems.
如果集中全力迎接可持续发展带来的挑战，我们的政府就能够更容易地解决目前的危机（比如达尔富尔）并防止将来爆发更多的危机。	By focusing on the underlying challenges of sustainable development, our governments could more easily end the current crises (as in Darfur) and head off many more crises in the future.
这一情绪背后的基础并不显而易见，因为美国经济比五六年前2007—2008年经济危机刚刚过去时情况要好。	The basis of this mood is hardly self-evident, as the country is better off economically than it was a half-dozen years ago, in the immediate aftermath of the 2007-2008 economic crisis.
美孚公司并未指明谁是这篇CRA报告的作者（伯恩斯坦和蒙哥马利是两位最主要的作者 ） ， 也没有指明谁为这份报告提供了资金（出资人是美国石油学会 ） 。	Mobil didn’t name who wrote the CRA report (Bernstein and Montgomery were the first two authors) or who funded it (API).
基于遗传的良好相貌并在社会生活中加以强化，可能已经在他们的声音模式中植入一个 通过电话可以投射的自信的语调。	A lifetime of social reinforcement based on their genetically given looks may have encoded into their voice patterns a tone of confidence that could be projected over the phone.
这场首次发生在社会主义国家之间的战争打破了苏联同其东欧附属国之间所谓牢不可破的“兄弟般的”联盟的神话。	That first war among socialist states shattered the myth of inviolable “fraternal” bonds between the Soviet Union and the captive nations of Eastern Europe.
2011年G-8峰会发起的“多维尔伙伴关系”仅仅是项半生不熟的倡议，而且早就因为各项事态频发而时过境迁。	The Deauville Partnership launched at the 2011 G-8 Summit was a half-baked initiative long overtaken by events.
这一区别在货币政策领域表现最为突出，决策机制毫无疑问不是政府间性质：欧洲央行理事会按照简单多数原则行事。	This distinction can be seen most strikingly in the area of monetary policy, where the decision-making mechanism is definitely not intergovernmental: the European Central Bank’s Governing Council operates on the basis of a simple majority.
今年以来，发展中国家整体将经历自2006年以来首次资本净流出的局面 — — 金额共计达6150亿美元。	This year, developing countries, taken together, are expected to record their first net capital outflow – totaling $615 billion – since 2006.
只有42个国家妇女赢得了30% 以上的国民立法机关席位，而在撒哈拉以南非洲、大洋洲和西部非洲，女孩仍然没有获得与男孩同等的受教育权。	In just 42 countries do women hold more than 30% of seats in the national legislature, and girls still do not have the same educational opportunities as boys in Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, and western Asia.
欧洲所处的长期混乱是其越来越复杂的内外部现实相互作用的结果 — — 其中最值得注意的是四大相互关联交错的生存威胁。	The constant state of turmoil in which Europe has found itself is a result of the increasing complexity and intertwining of its internal and external realities – shaped, most notably, by four overlapping existential threats.
在公司董事会和证券市场里的焦虑情绪或许已得到缓和，但为了生活而苦苦挣扎的悲剧却仍然每天上演。 实际上，对于大多数生活在世界上最不发达国家的乡村和街道上的人们而言，悲剧正在加深 — — 而非洲尤甚。	Anxiety levels may have come down, in board rooms and stock markets, but the daily drama for survival continues. Indeed, for many people it has deepened, in the villages and streets of the world’s least-developed countries – particularly in Africa.
据美国医学研究所的护具，目前美国每年在无必要和低效率医疗服务、管理成本臃肿、价格高企、医疗诈骗和错失预防机会上要浪费7500亿美元以上。	According to the Institute of Medicine, the US currently wastes more than $750 billion per year on unnecessary or inefficient health-care services, excessive administrative costs, high prices, medical fraud, and missed opportunities for prevention.
20世纪80年代，罗伯特·索洛（Robert Solow）和史蒂芬·罗奇（Stephen Roach）各自指出，IT投资没有表现出对生产率有什么影响。	In the 1980’s, Robert Solow and Stephen Roach separately argued that IT investment was showing no impact on productivity.
克林顿引用了威尔逊的“自由市场、自由选举、自由民族”愿景，宣称中国加入世贸组织预示着“中华民族更开放、更自由的未来 ” 。	Citing Woodrow Wilson’s vision of “free markets, free elections, and free peoples,” Clinton declared that China’s WTO entry would herald “a future of greater openness and freedom for the people of China.”
虽然理论上与中左翼共和人民党（CHP）结成大联盟的可能性存在，但这样的假设却与土耳其的政治文化不符。	A grand coalition with the main opposition party, the center-left Republican People’s Party (CHP), though theoretically possible, is not congruous with Turkey’s political culture.
美国证券与交易委员会（SEC）从8月初开始实施一项规则，要求上市公司披露员工与CEO之间的薪酬差距。	In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted a rule at the beginning of August requiring public companies to disclose the pay gap between workers and CEOs.
事实上，许多国家都尝试过但失败了，最终陷入了所谓的中等收入陷阱，人均收入在越过高收入门槛之前便开始走下坡路。	Indeed, many countries have tried and failed, leaving them in a so-called middle-income trap, in which per capita income levels stagnate before crossing the high-income threshold.
逆戟鲸是一种具有社交性需要的哺乳动物，如果不是被抓住了， Tilly 应该是和它母亲以及其他外貌类似的亲戚一起生活的。	Orcas are social mammals, and he would have been living with his mother and other relatives in a pod.
此外，在六十年瞎干预后，欧盟决策者应该后退一步，思考那些限制是有害的或无关紧要的，以及如何更好地支持未来企业家和行业。	And, after six decades of meddling, EU policymakers should step back and consider which restrictions have become harmful or irrelevant, and how better to support the entrepreneurs and industries of the future.
人口较多的国家双向商务旅行也更多，但旅行量的增量不及人口比例：如果一个国家人口比另一个国家多100 % ， 其商务旅行量将只多出70%左右。	More populous countries have more business travel in both directions, but the volume is less than proportional to their population: a country with 100% more population than another has only about 70% more business travel.
引发这场新危机的原因有十个，请让我一一道来：首先，当前推动美国年增长率高于其2％增长潜力的财政刺激政策是不可持续的。	There are 10 reasons for this. First, the fiscal-stimulus policies that are currently pushing the annual US growth rate above its 2% potential are unsustainable.
格林斯潘认为，应当立即采取行动避免这一即将到来的灾难，因为这一灾难将会阻碍美联储实施货币政策的能力！	According to Greenspan, immediate action needed to be taken to avert this looming disaster, which would impede the Fed’s ability to conduct monetary policy!
给碳基能源、电力和工业活动定更高的价格将刺激人们使用更清洁的燃料、节约能量、促进向更绿色的投资的转变。	Placing a higher price on carbon-based fuels, electricity, and industrial activities will create incentives for the use of cleaner fuels, save energy, and promote a shift to greener investments.
他们将发表一份声明，其中包括关于峰会主要议题的多种多样的市政意见，并敦促各国政府与地方政府进行更为紧密的合作。	They will present a declaration that includes a diverse collection of municipal views on the summit’s key themes, and urge national governments to collaborate more closely with their local counterparts.
最低限度是天然及合化学物质在动物致癌研究中的检出率相差无几，并且“考虑到极低的接触剂量，甚至可以用微不足道来形容合成农药残留的相对危险性 。 ”	The bottom line is that natural chemicals are just as likely as synthetic versions to test positive in animal cancer studies, and “at the low doses of most human exposures, the comparative hazards of synthetic pesticide residues are insignificant.”
国际移民组织（IOM）和UNHCR（联合国难民署）以及其他许多非政府组织在保护利比亚受威胁移民方面上下奔走，成果显著。	The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency, were heroic in going above and beyond their mandates to protect migrants at risk in Libya, as were many NGOs.
但解决上述问题的任何努力都必须伴随着最终逆转就业和收入两极化的举措，恰恰是这两个问题一直在助长民众的不满和政治不稳定。	But any effort to address these issues must be coupled with measures that mitigate and eventually reverse the job and income polarization that has been fueling popular discontent and political instability.
因此，安倍决心更改 — — 或至少重新解释 — — 日本宪法，以允许采取从以色列到印度诸国在人民受到威胁时所采取的防卫行动。	That is why Abe is determined to amend, or at least reinterpret, Japan’s constitution to allow for the kinds of defense maneuvers that other countries, from Israel to India, employ when their people are threatened.
为此第一步是要确保未来的网络具备足够的带宽来处理高清视频等应用 — — 这类应用很快将占用大部分用户流量。	The first step in doing that is ensuring that future networks have enough bandwidth to handle applications like high-definition video, which will soon account for the majority of user traffic.
全球实体工程师（各国决策层 ） — —剔除那些有个人财务利益诉求的少数 — — 应该抵制这些负面解读，虽然不能幻想找到速效药。	The real engineers, excluding those whose judgment is clouded by personal financial interests, should counter this influence, while refusing to succumb to the temptation of quick fixes.
诚然，技术领域的总体进展往往能产生巨大的社会福利效益，这种效益甚至可能超过近几十年来所有其他行业的总和。	Admittedly, progress in the technology sector overall often produces huge social-welfare gains, which arguably outstrip those produced by all other sectors in recent decades.
这一社区领导方针将是海地总理拉模特（Laurent Lamothe ）和我在我访问帕尔马斯期间所提出的“总体卫生运动”获得成功的关键。	This community-led approach will be critical to the success of the “total sanitation campaign,” which Haitian Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe and I launched in Los Palmas during my visit.
2014年12月，土耳其成为G-20主席国，自此以来，我们通过集体行动确保包容性强健增长的方针受到了G-20组织各成员国的支持。	Since Turkey assumed the presidency of the G-20 in December 2014, our approach toward ensuring inclusive and robust growth through collective action has enjoyed the support of the organization’s members.
随着跟多的人拥有了“职业生涯组合 ” — —依靠多重收入源而不仅仅是一个工作 — — 收集和分析劳动力市场数据变得更加困难。	As more people adopt “portfolio careers” – relying on several sources of income, rather than a single job – it becomes harder to collect and analyze labor-market data.
在截至7月的一年中 ， 《 经济学人》商品价格指数下跌了16.5 % （ 按美元计价，若按欧元计价，则跌幅为22.4 % ） ，其中金属价格自2011年初见顶以来已经下跌了两年多。	Over the year ending in July, The Economist’s commodity-price index fell by 16.5% in dollar terms (22.4% in euros) with metal prices falling for more than two years since peaking in early 2011.
在2001年，时任美国驻海地大使的迪安·科兰（Dean Curran）曾公开明确地将泛美开发银行贷款的扣留和海地的政党达成美国希望的妥协的要求联系起来。	In 2001, then-US Ambassador to Haiti Dean Curran publicly and explicitly linked the withholding of IDB loans to the demand that Haiti’s political parties reach a compromise that America wanted.
虽然这肯定会阻碍德国经济的长期增长，并造成重大的结构性问题，但是，这也意味着，德国在采取极强的抗周期行动，并在很大程度上稳定了经济，而这对全世界都是有利的。	While this certainly impedes long-term economic growth and causes great structural problems, it also means that the state reacts extremely counter-cyclically and stabilizes the economy to a great extent, which benefits the entire world.
房地产价格开始上升，建筑业迎来繁荣，扩张进入高速发展的新阶段，其中部分支持因素来自国内经济包括服务业的复兴。	Real-estate prices start to rise, a construction boom occurs, and a new phase of rapid expansion begins, partly sustained by the revitalization of the domestic economy, including services.
尼古拉斯一世的统治结合了帝国雄心和宗教狂热（即针对奥斯曼帝国，也针对天主教 ） ， 而俄罗斯的战败也是伟大的。	Nicholas’s reign combined imperial ambition and religious fervor (directed against both the Ottoman Empire and the Catholic Church), and Russia’s defeat was glorious.
按照这位离过两次婚、公开声称自己是“文化天主教徒”的总统的说法，法国应该建立一种“积极的世俗主义 ” 。	In particular, according to the twice-divorced self-confessed “cultural Catholic,” France should develop a “positive secularism.”
当弗里茨·朗为其1927年的突破性影片《大都会》创作未来城市景观时，天空中布满了令人眼花缭乱的高楼和精巧的飞行器。	When Fritz Lang created the futuristic cityscape for his groundbreaking 1927 film, Metropolis, he filled its skies with vertiginous towers and compact flying vehicles.
在竞争力改善之前，经济将跌入无通胀或通缩的泪水之谷，因此有理由怀疑以当选为目标的目光短浅的政客是否能够坚持住。	Given that disinflation or deflation leads through a valley of tears before competitiveness improves, there is reason to doubt whether election-minded politicians, with their short-term orientation, are capable of staying the course.
联合国及绿色和平组织正在通过“制冷剂，自然选择 ！ ” 计划与可口可乐、百事可乐、红牛和联合利华合作推进这项工作。	The United Nations and Greenpeace, through an initiative called “Refrigerants, Naturally!”, are working with Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Redbull, and Unilever to do the same.
但对话应该聚焦于采取直接措施遏制和阻挠朝鲜固有的侵略性核计划 — — 而不是提供更多的让步，让步只能让流氓政权得寸进尺。	But the discussion should focus on direct measures to impede and undermine the country’s inherently aggressive nuclear program – not to offer more concessions that will only strengthen a rogue regime’s hand.
但其他恐怖组织 — — 尤其是基地组织 — — 过去的经历显示，即使没有类似于国家的机构，极端意识形态也能够继续存活。	But the experience of other terrorist groups – most notably, al-Qaeda – shows that, even without anything resembling a state, radical ideologies can survive.
在工作体验这个问题上，许多人 — — 特别是欧洲大陆人 — — 认为最优配置（带来运转良好的机构）如能加上教育投资便已足够。	When it comes to the experience of work, many – especially in continental Europe – believe that optimal allocation (entailing well-functioning institutions), if accompanied by investment in education, is all that is needed.
如果日本的女性劳动力参与率能提升10 % — —这是一个完全可以实现的目标 — — 那就将把整体的劳动力参与率提升近5 % 。	A 10% increase in Japan’s female labor-force participation rate – an entirely attainable goal – would translate into an almost 5% gain in total labor-force participation.
如伊朗神学家、德黑兰大学的沙贝斯塔利（Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestari）所强调的，与正义和人权有关的许多思想 — — 如我们今天所理解的那样 — — 在前现代时期完全是“不可想象的 ” （ un-thought ） 。	As the Iranian theologian Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestari of the University of Tehran emphasizes, many of the ideas associated with justice and human rights, as we understand them today, were completely “un-thought” in the pre-modern era.
在巴拉克·奥巴马担任总统期间，这两者是坚称奥巴马出生在美国境外，因此不具备总统任职资格的“出生地质疑派”种族主义运动的代表人物。	During Barack Obama’s presidency, both were prominent figures in the racist “birther” movement that insisted Obama was born outside the US, and therefore was not entitled to be president.
但这些失败并不意味着伊斯兰国的灭亡，更不意味着伊斯兰恐怖主义的灭亡，也不意味着中东最激烈的冲突将在不远的将来得到解决。	But these defeats do not mean the downfall of ISIS, much less Islamist terrorism, or that the Middle East’s most acute conflicts will be resolved anytime soon.
此前，读者可以非常轻松地区分不可靠的信息来源，如超市排队交费期间购买的五颜六色和耸人听闻的小报，读者也可以轻易分辨出可靠来源，比如历史悠久的地方或全国性新闻报道。	Previously, readers could easily distinguish between non-credible sources, like the colorful and sensational tabloids in the checkout line at the supermarket, and credible ones, such as longstanding local or national newspapers.
平心而论，如果全球经济真的正在回归相对高而稳定的增长，那么货币政策紧缩未必是有害的 — — 甚至可能比等待更强烈的通胀信号出现危害更小。	To be sure, if the global economy is truly returning to relatively high and stable growth, monetary-policy tightening need not be harmful – and may even be less harmful than waiting for stronger evidence of inflation to emerge.
看一下不久前取消对埃塞俄比亚援助的情况就清楚了：每年每个埃塞俄比亚人从这笔援助中只能得到约15美元¾而且这其中的很大一部分实际上还付给了来自欧美的顾问。	Consider the recent threats to cut Ethiopia’s aid, which is on the order of $15 per Ethiopian per year – much of it actually paid to US and European consultants.
经过最初的错位之后，最终的结果将会实现约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯的梦想，建立债权和债务国共担维稳责任的国际货币制度。	After initial dislocations, the eventual outcome would fulfill John Maynard Keynes’ dream of an international currency system in which both creditors and debtors share responsibility for maintaining stability.
虽然目前还不清楚这些死亡是由于耳道假丝酵母菌感染还是基本健康状况所致，但对耳道假丝酵母菌危害性的研究 — — 已经导致高达70％的被感染者死亡 — — 是无法回避的。	While it remains unclear whether those deaths were due to the C. auris infection or to underlying health conditions, the need to address the scourge of C. auris – which has led to the deaths of up to 70% of those infected – cannot be disputed.
犹太人当时其人口不到英属巴勒斯坦总人口的20 % ， 成立了民族委员会（Va’ad Leumi ） ， 并且选举产生了一个机构巴勒斯坦犹太人代表大会。	The Jews – then less than 20% of British Palestine’s population – set up what became known as the National Committee (Va’ad Leumi), based on an elected body, the Representative Assembly of Palestinian Jews.
尽管他1小时后就恢复了知觉，并完成了那次讲话，埃及人还是开始要求对总统健康状况更多的知情权，其它国事领域也是如此。	Although he returned an hour later and delivered the rest of his speech, Egyptians began to demand greater transparency regarding the president's health as well as other state affairs.
今天，尤其在本应“由民主政府通过特定程序来贯彻执行的前提下 ” ， 很难对“自由和无畏推理”的力量抱有如此强烈的信心 — — 这个假设成立的前提条件是“自由和无畏的推理”能够影响选举进程。	Today, it is difficult to have so much confidence in the power of “free and fearless reasoning,” especially if it is supposed to be “applied through the processes of popular government” – which presumably requires that it influence elections.
在布鲁金斯研究所（Brookings Institution）的罗伯特·利坦（Robert Litan）在其新著《万亿美元经济学家 》 （ Trillion Dollar Economists）中指出，经济学界“为美国和世界其他地区创造了数万亿美元收入和财富 。 ”	In his new book Trillion Dollar Economists, Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution argues that the economics profession has “created trillions of dollars of income and wealth for the United States and the rest of the world.”
每个人都有权决定自身的健康状况，无论他们是谁，无论他们生活在哪里，无论他们秉承何种信仰，也无论他们采用何种谋生方式。	Everyone is free to make decisions about their health, regardless of who they are, where they live, what they believe, or how they earn a living.
事实上绝大多数党徒早就把家人送到了国外以让后者免于遭受自身所创造的混乱，因此把这些人的配偶和子女放在名单上会使排斥措施变得特别有效。	In fact, most henchmen have sent their families abroad, saving them from the mayhem they have created. Placing the spouses and children of henchmen on the list would make ostracism particularly effective.
比如一部名为《高铁侠》的中国动画遭到了本国网民的极力声讨，因为这部动画其实是照抄著名日本动画《铁胆火车侠 》 。	For example, a Chinese animation called “Train Hero” received much criticism in Chinese Internet circles when it was found to be nearly identical to the popular Japanese animation called “Japan Hikarian Railroad.”
2012年2月，在卡斯商学院（Cass Business School）的演讲中，英国金融服务局前主席阿代尔·特纳（Adair Turner）指出，如果进一步从市场借钱在政治或金融上不可行，那么这也不失为一个选择。	In a lecture to the Cass Business School in February 2012, Adair Turner, former Chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority, proposed it as an option if further borrowing from the markets were politically or financially impossible.
在贸易和经常项目盈余节节攀升的同时，中国人民银行保持和外汇市场干预以遏制升值，从而积累巨大的外汇储备。	Alongside rising trade and current-account surpluses, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) maintained a policy of intervening in the foreign-exchange market to dampen appreciation, thereby amassing huge foreign exchange reserves.
当然，欧洲还必须鼓励企业家精神，而这需要建设冒险文化、让风险投资更加容易获得，并投资建设强大的教育机构。	Of course, Europe will also have to encourage entrepreneurship, which requires fostering a culture of risk-taking, facilitating access to venture capital, and investing in strong educational institutions.
一种更宏阔更深远的历史视野认为，全球化可以把罗马帝国和中国的宋朝包括在内，甚至一直上溯到人类从共同的发祥地非洲向全球扩散的史前时期。	Instead, the wider and deeper historical vision is of a globalization that encompasses the Roman empire and the Song dynasty, and goes back to the globalization of the human species from a common African origin.
定价必须将所有成本都转嫁给最终用户，不仅包括生产和购买成本，也包括密集依赖化石燃料所导致的伤害成本 — — 如空气污染和气候变化。	Prices should pass on to end users the full cost not only of production and acquisition, but also of the damage – including air pollution and climate change – caused by intensive reliance on fossil fuels.
马德里—本月，美国国家情报委员会公布了一份不容乐观的报告 ： 《 全球趋势2030：不一样的世界 》 （ Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds ） 。	MADRID – This month, the United States National Intelligence Council released a sobering report entitled Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds.
美国民主共和两党共同信奉的误导性高压政策鼓励了军队在反毒品斗争中作用的强化，而这种策略在曾经做过尝试的所有国家都没有得到很好的收效。	The armed forces’ role in fighting narcotics – which has been ineffective in every country where it has been tried – is encouraged by a coercive, misguided, bipartisan US strategy.
如果穆迪步标普的后尘，剥夺美国的AAA评级，那么最后可能的结果是有能力也愿意增加美国政府证券持有量的全球投资者会逐渐减磅。	Were Moody’s to follow S&P in stripping the US of its triple-A rating, the most likely outcome is that the universe of global investors who are both able and willing to increase their holdings of US government securities would shrink over time.
亲眼目睹麻疹和其他儿童疾病 — — 如流行性腮腺炎、风疹、脊髓灰质炎和百日咳等 — — 影响的人数减少了，社会也不再着力于远离这些疾病。	As the number of people who have witnessed firsthand the effects of measles and other childhood diseases – such as mumps, rubella, polio, and whooping cough – has declined, so has society’s commitment to keeping them away.
苏东阵营的分崩离析曾令他们心惊胆战，中共官员在当年三月如此总结道 ： “ 应尽一切努力，以阻止东欧剧变对中国的内部发展产生影响 。 ” 之后数月内，他们便对民主抗议者进行了暴力镇压。	“Every effort should be made to prevent changes in Eastern Europe from influencing China’s internal development,” party officials concluded in March 1989, and within months they violently crushed democratic protesters.
所谓激进失败者就是那些在社会，经济和性方面缺乏自信且对周围世界的冷漠恼怒不已的年轻人，这些人长期幻想着制造一场破坏巨大的自杀式行为。	Radical losers are mostly young men who are so enraged by their own lack of social, economic, and sexual self-esteem and the indifference of the world around them, that they long for a suicidal act of mass destruction.
俄罗斯军队轰炸了格鲁吉亚无数的战略和民用目标，摧毁了基础设施，造成了食品、汽油和药品越来越严重的短缺。	The Russians bombed numerous strategic and civilian targets in Georgia, destroying infrastructure and producing growing shortages of food, fuel, and medicine.
另一方面，流落在本国境内的伊拉克人将有机会回到本国剩余的城市和家园 — — 伊拉克库尔德人今年再次推动独立的行动则加速了这一进程。	Internally displaced Iraqis, on the other hand, are expected to return to whatever remains of their cities and homes – a process that has been accelerated by the Iraqi Kurds’ renewed push for independence this year.
每一家欧盟银行都需要对其位于美因河（Main River）畔的监督者俯首帖耳，即便其负责人恰恰是法国人丹尼勒·瑙依（Danièle Nouy ） 。	Every European Union bank will need to bend the knee to its supervisor on the Main River, even if she does happen to be a Frenchwoman, Danièle Nouy.
由“新政主义”提出、并在二战中得以发展的监管机制和行为准则得以全部生效。 它们包括：社会安全、工会劳动力关系体系和市场规范。	The regulatory institutions and behavioral norms that originated in the New Deal and developed during WWII came into full force: social security, a system of unionized labor relations, market regulation.
因此，新的发表内容和动态网页，由于它们的内容经常改变且已超出流行的使用方法的范围，搜索这种资料很容易受到基本操作技术的误导。	Therefore, new publications and dynamic pages that change their content frequently are already beyond the scope of the popularity methods, and searching this material is vulnerable to rudimentary techniques of manipulation.
欧洲宪法和这些挑战毫无关系，但是大部分法国人已经开始质疑那个长期以来掩饰着法国日益衰弱的地位的策略。	The European Constitution has little to do with any of these challenges, but a majority of French people has started questioning the strategy that has long masked France’s diminishing status.
但是，十九世纪两位伟大的社会学家卡尔·马克思和阿利克西斯·德托克维尔更为深刻理解是何种力量驱动人们并改变社会。	But Karl Marx and Alexis de Tocqueville, the two great social analysts of the nineteenth century, knew better what makes people tick, and what makes societies change.
如果无法实现这样的改变，美国就有可能不再参与JCPOA，这样的威胁纯属虚张声势，即使兑现了也必然会失败。	The threat to terminate US participation in the JCPOA if such changes are not made will thus prove either empty or self-defeating if carried out.
请回想一下所有洗钱和违反制裁禁令（比如上周法国农业信贷银行，本周德意志银行以及在过去几年中几乎每一家主要国际性银行的所作所为 ） 。	Consider all the instances of money laundering and sanctions busting (with evidence against Credit Agricole last week, Deutsche Bank this week, and almost every major international bank in the past few years).
许多穆斯林青年在自己出生的国度饱受歧视，而那些极端言论，不管是出自伊斯兰极端主义者还是其对手，都为最终的暴力创造了滋生的土壤。	Many young Muslims feel unwanted in their countries of birth, and extreme language, whether used by Islamists or their opponents, helps to create an atmosphere conducive to violence.
国际货币基金组织主席、法国人思特劳斯·卡恩可以轻而易举地从任何范围的前危机国家、包括墨西哥、巴西、韩国、土耳其、日本以及瑞典，更不用说阿根廷、俄国、智利以及其他许多国家那里挑选一个超级专家小组。	The head of the IMF, Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, could easily select a superb panel from any range of former crisis countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Korea, Turkey, Japan, and Sweden, not to mention Argentina, Russia, Chile, and many others.
正如欧洲经常出现的情况那样，成员国之间的差异相当显著：现金交易所占的份额在芬兰为42 ％ ， 而马耳他则高达92 ％ 。	As is often the case in Europe, the differences among member states are pronounced: the share of cash transactions ranges from 42% in Finland to 92% in Malta.
四月中旬，日本众议院宪法研究委员会发表了关于日本宪法所面临的基本问题的最终报告，并提交给众议院议长。	In mid-April, the Constitution Review committee of Japan’s House of Representatives issued a final report on the fundamental problems facing Japan’s Constitution and submitted it to the Chair of House of the Diet.
前三个G20国家首脑会议 — — 华盛顿，伦敦和匹兹堡会议 — — 都因推动了多边主义和全球合作而被人们铭记。	The first three G-20 summits of chiefs of state, in Washington, London, and Pittsburgh, will be remembered for advancing multilateralism and coordinated global action.
人们开始注意到全球化赢家和输家之间巨大且不断深化的差距，伴随工资增长萎靡一起出现的是富人财富的高额回报。	People began to note a distinct and deepening disparity between globalization’s winners and losers, with weak wage growth accompanied by robust returns for the wealthy.
首先，也是最重要的一点，就是缅甸的战略重要性取决于它位处印度、中国，泰国和东南亚四者交界的地理位置。	Burma’s strategic importance reflects, first and foremost, its geographic location between India, China, Thailand, and Southeast Asia.
许多国家也在加强对外国直接投资流入的控制；对企业合并和收购行为实施更严格的甄选；并要求相互开放市场准入作为投资回报。	Many countries are also tightening controls on inward FDI; applying stricter screening measures to mergers and acquisitions; and demanding reciprocal market access in return for investment.
在阿拉伯领导人的强力支持下，约旦国王阿卜杜拉二世正式提出了这项由阿拉伯联盟和伊斯兰国家组织设计的和平计划。	Empowered by Arab leaders, Jordan’s King Abdullah II officially presented the peace plan devised by the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic States.
巴西无法在不引起衰退的情况下控制通货膨胀，其自2010年以来的颓势并不是因为运气不好或私人部门企业家精神流失，而是因为政治失败。	Unable to keep inflation under control without causing a recession, the country has, since 2010, got stuck not because of bad luck, or any loss of entrepreneurial spirit in its private sector, but because of political failings.
这一缺陷的最新写照是比利时-法国联营的德夏（Dexia）银行在2011年的倒闭 — — 彼时它刚刚胜利通过欧洲银监局的压力测试。	The latest example highlighting this flaw is Dexia, the Belgian-French banking group that failed in 2011 – just after passing the European Banking Authority’s stress test with flying colors.
目前巨型工程支出每年已高达6—9万亿美元，约占全球GDP的8 % ， 这意味着这是“人类历史上规模最大的投资繁荣 ” 。	Already, spending on megaprojects amounts to some $6-9 trillion a year, roughly 8% of global GDP, making this the “biggest investment boom in human history.”
美国和欧盟却有着不同的想法，他们希望看到民主的转变和把巴尔干半岛的所有国家都融入北约以及最终融入欧盟。	The United States and the European Union are committed to a different vision: democratic transition and integration of all of the Balkans into NATO and eventually the EU.
首先，虽然中东大部战火不断，但并未发生石油供给冲击或禁运，美国的页岩气革命也增加了低成本能源的供给。	For starters, even with much of the Middle East burning, there have been no oil-supply shocks or embargos, and the shale-gas revolution in the United States has increased the supply of low-cost energy.
一夜之间，本意是为了保护加拿大人免受伊斯兰恐怖主义袭击的政策演变为一项冲击加拿大人身份感的政策：加拿大应该是一个开放、有同情心的社会。	Suddenly, a policy purportedly intended to protect Canadians from Islamist terrorism became a policy that offended Canadians’ sense of who they were: an open, compassionate society.
原告之一名叫 利斯贝思·切里亚尼，她是一位 43 岁患有乳腺癌的女性，医生建议她接受与乳腺癌特定遗传形式相关的两项基因突变测试。	One of the plaintiffs is Lisbeth Ceriani, a 43-year-old woman with breast cancer whose doctors recommended that she be tested for two genetic mutations involved in some hereditary forms of the disease.

然而，对于许多妇女而言，面纱已经成为一种解放的象征，表明她们已经参与到摩洛哥的公众活动中来，反映自己对宗教活动的认识和见解。	For many women, however, the veil is a token of liberation – an indication that they have engaged with the Moroccan public in ways that reflect their own sense of religious practice.
在乌干达，从前即使公民发起反对腐败或支持同性恋权利的运动常常面临怀有敌意的公众，也不会因为示威而面临监禁。	In Uganda, although citizens campaigning against corruption or in favor of gay rights often faced a hostile public, they didn’t face jail time for demonstrating.
今年5月，在世卫组织一年一度的世卫大会上，来自数十个国家的官员探讨了如何借助联合国可持续发展目标实现全民医疗覆盖。	In May, at the World Health Organization’s annual World Health Assembly, officials from dozens of countries discussed how to achieve universal health coverage through the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
接着，Werqit帮助你找出定位于谁来实现目标 — — 可以是为创业公司找融资、为自己找工作、销售你的产品、出版你的书或任何你可以定义的东西（包括众包收集 ） 。	Then it helps to figure out whom to target to achieve that goal – whether it’s funding for a startup, a job for yourself, a sale for your product, a publisher for your book, or any other mission you can define (and add to a crowd-sourced collection).
这种结构与雅虎原来提供的目录服务有几分类似，但现在不仅能够自动生成、而且更有深度，涉及的范围也更广，早已超越了运动和旅游领域。	It’s structure – the same sort of context the old Yahoo! catalogue supplied, but this time automatically generated and deeper – and across more than just a few categories such as sports and travel.
美国正面临增长减速、通胀加速，亦即滞涨，这个突出的问题令人们开始质疑决策者的胜任能力以及他们的经济模型的适当性。	The United States was confronting slowing growth and accelerating inflation, or stagflation, a novel problem that raised questions about policymakers’ competence and the adequacy of their economic models.
与其担心100美元中70美分会“捐赠直至受损 ” ， 还不如将我们在富裕国家中的口号变成“捐赠直至复愈 ” 。	Instead of worrying that 70 cents per $100 is giving till it hurts, our slogan in the rich countries should be “Giving Till it Heals.”
结果很明显：在当前的监管体系中，各机构之间的责任划分清楚而僵化，已经完全与中国快速增长、日益一体化的资本市场脱节。	The conclusion is clear: the current regulatory system, characterized by a clear and rigid division of responsibility among its constituent bodies, is completely out of sync with China’s rapidly growing, and increasingly integrated, capital markets.
问题在于，工业部门快速的劳动生产率增长（过去二十年每年大于10 % ） 正在减少雇用更多工人的需要。	The problem is that rapid labor-productivity growth in the industrial sector – more than 10% per year over the last two decades – is reducing the need to hire more workers.
不受管制的能源市场绝非有用的治理机制，这主要是因为能源具有环境负外部性，而不受管制的能源市场无法将环境成本内部化。	Owing mainly to its environmentally negative externalities, an unregulated energy market is not a useful governing mechanism, because it is unable to internalize the environmental costs.
今年耶路撒冷的大屠杀纪念日又一次见证了以色列领导人争先恐后地迎合伊朗意图问题上悲观颓丧的民族心理和在公众中蔓延的歇斯底里情绪。	Holocaust Remembrance Day in Jerusalem this year again saw Israeli leaders competing with each other in feeding the gloom of the national psyche and public hysteria surrounding Iran’s intentions.
· 当我们遭遇麻烦后，美联储与财政部决定对美国国际集团（AIG）进行国有化并偿付其债务，而不是选择向其同行提供援助之手，这令当时的金融家们相信他们在战略上还是没什么问题的；	· the Fed and the Treasury decided, once we were in trouble, to nationalize AIG and pay its bills rather than to support its counterparties, which allowed financiers to pretend that their strategies were fundamentally sound;
欧盟成功在一个曾经反复被战争蹂躏的区域内创造了和平，同时也为东欧和西欧的重新联合提供了制度框架，还推动了区域内部的基础设施建设。	The EU has created a zone of peace where once there was relentless war. It has provided the institutional framework for reuniting Western and Eastern Europe.
美国之所以最终选择了跨太平洋伙伴关系协议，只是因为中国在宣示其南海主权以及中印中日领土冲突方面过于激进。	The US finally got it with the TPP, simply because China had become aggressive in asserting its territorial claims in the South China Sea, the South China Sea, and vis-à-vis India and Japan.
这些政策和制度性进步能增进生产率、促进竞争、有利专业化、增加资源配置的效率、保护环境并减少风险和不确定性。	Such policies and institutional improvements increase productivity, promote competition, facilitate specialization, enhance the efficiency of resource allocation, protect the environment, and reduce risks and uncertainties.
最近，特朗普又在他的佛罗里达州庄园招待了习近平，在会晤期间没有提到任何中国停止不公平贸易和投资行为的要求，而他在选战期间对这些行为大加抨击。	More recently, Trump hosted Xi at his Florida resort, without requiring that China dismantle any of the unfair trade and investment practices that he railed against during the campaign.
全球民主理想都在受到威胁，包括在民主国家内部，因此，我们的共同文化和意识形态基础绝不是天上掉下来的。	With democratic ideals under threat around the world, including within democratic countries, their shared cultural and ideological foundations cannot be taken for granted.
而之前对于议题范围和结果的协议不应成为对话的前提 — — 或者逃避对话的借口，而应当被视为谈判自身的一个议题。	Prior agreement on the scope or outcome should not be a precondition for talks – or an excuse to avoid them – but rather a subject of the negotiations themselves.
和其他受助国一样，希腊陷入了与其债权人的相互依存（codependent）关系，这一关系以补贴贷款和利息偿付延期为形式的事实债务纾困为形式提供援助。	Like other aid recipients, Greece has become locked in a codependent relationship with its creditors, which are providing assistance in the form of de facto debt relief through subsidized loans and deferred interest payments.
最后谈谈乔治·W·布什这样的政治家的例子，他们颁布政府方案，向年长者许诺综合药物福利，向制药公司承诺巨大利润。	Finally, there is the example of politicians like George W. Bush, who enacted a government program that promises comprehensive drug benefits to the elderly and mammoth profits to pharmaceutical companies.
和大多数俄罗斯人一样，他想要资本主义带来的物质好处，但是对法制和权力分散这些资本主义体制得以运行的保障毫无敬意或了解。	Like most Russians, he wanted the material advantages of capitalism, but had little respect or understanding for the rule of law and dispersion of power, which makes capitalist institutions work.
除非情况发生逆转，否则印度北部和东部、南部和西部之间的经济发展速度和人口数量差距将引发严重的政治威胁。	Unless recent trends can be reversed, the growing economic and demographic gulf between India's North and East and its South and West will pose a serious political threat.
从2010年到2015年，得州产妇死亡率接近翻番，目前得州妇女死于分娩的可能性和塔吉克斯坦妇女相当。	Between 2010 and 2015, maternal mortality in the state nearly doubled, and women in Texas are now more likely to die from childbirth than women in Tajikistan.
克林顿和起许多人所认可的一个解释是选举前几天的俄罗斯网络行动和联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米（James Comey）不“配合”的“宣布 ” （ 后来又不了了之 ） 。	One plausible answer, offered by Clinton and many others, focuses on the role of Russian cyber operations and FBI Director James Comey’s unconscionable “announcement” (of what amounted to nothing) just days before the vote.
是的，在社会主义的名义下，四分之一或二分之一世纪之前有过一些失败的实验；但今天的实验和过去绝无相似之处。	Yes, there may have been failed experiments under that rubric a quarter- or half-century ago; but today’s experiments bear no resemblance to those of the past.
来自共和党的挑战者 — — 米特·罗姆尼（Mitt Romney）试图利用这一问题，他宣称 ： “ 奥巴马总统的计划并不凑效，他没有一个能推动经济的计划 。 ”	The Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, sought to capitalize on the issue, asserting: “The president’s plans haven’t worked – he doesn’t have a plan to get the economy going.”
突尼斯独立至今已有55个年头，而科特迪瓦也独立了51年，但法国却一再在这些国家中扮演着决定性的角色。	Tunisia has been independent for 55 years, and Côte d’Ivoire for 51 years, yet France is once more playing a decisive role in these countries.
如今，欧洲距离衰退开始已经过去了四年，但2011年，27个欧盟成员国中的26个国家，私人投资仍低于2007年的水平。	Europe is four years removed from the onset of recession, but private investment in 2011 was still lower than its 2007 level in 26 of the European Union’s 27 member states.
正在迅速消失的物种为我们人类提供不可或缺的生态系统功能：控制气候、维持土壤肥沃、给庄稼授粉并抵御病虫害、过滤清洁水、提供粮食，等等。	The species that are so rapidly disappearing provide human beings with indispensable ecosystem services: regulating the climate, maintaining soil fertility, pollinating crops and defending them from pests, filtering fresh water, and supplying food.
其中一个这样的趋势就是独立公共道德权威人士的涌现，比如成功商人、受人尊敬的学者和记者、著名的作家和具有影响力的博客作者。	One such trend is the emergence of independent figures of public moral authority: successful businessmen, respected academics and journalists, famous writers, and influential bloggers.
这一安排是时任欧洲央行行长特里谢（Jean-Claude Trichet）提出的，它显然违反了马斯特里赫特条约的无援助条款，而该条款是德国放弃马克的基本条件。	That arrangement was proposed by then-ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet, in clear breach of the Maastricht Treaty’s no-bailout rule, which had been Germany’s fundamental condition for giving up the Deutschmark.
提前选举意味着英国必须在2019年3月正式脱离欧盟，因为梅不可能遭到议会反对，连理论上的可能性都没有。	The early election makes it inevitable that Britain will formally leave the EU in March 2019, because May will no longer face even the theoretical possibility of parliamentary opposition.
武器配置和物流方面都存在着这个问题，尽管近年来在各国都努力用更少的预算做更多的事，但在整合和标准化中还是有巨大的潜力可挖。	This is true of weaponry as well as logistical capabilities, where, despite immense efforts over the years to get more out of the shrinking funds, there is still great potential for integration and standardization.
充足、廉价的水时代已经一去不返，取而代之的是日益加剧的供给和质量制约，在这样的局面下，许多投资者开始把水视为新的石油。	With the era of cheap, bountiful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints, many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil.
目前，中国储蓄并投资了GDP的一半，但是，随着今后几年其劳动力数量的下���，其投资率可能大幅下降。	China currently saves and invests half of its GDP, but, as its workforce shrinks in the coming years, its investment rate is likely to fall sharply.
首先，中国的关税及非关税壁垒高于美国和其他高收入国家（尽管与绝大多数同等收入水平的发展中国家相比是大体一致的 ） 。	For starters, China’s tariffs and non-tariff barriers are higher than those of the US and other high-income countries (though not higher that most developing countries with comparable income levels).
这听上去像是取得了一场彻底的胜利：仅仅宣布“直接货币交易”方略就足以令货币联盟的存在性危机得到终结。	That may sound like a resounding success: the mere announcement of the OMT scheme was enough to end the monetary union’s existential crisis.
以国际货币基金组织的配额和治理改革为例，G20各国领袖早已在2010年表决同意，如今却依然是一纸空文。	For example, IMF quota and governance reform, on which G-20 leaders agreed in 2010, has yet to be implemented.
此外，能被具有全球视野的机构 — — 比如美联储和英格兰银行 — — 明智并合理使用的工具在某些国家里可能会呈现不同的特点，因为无法保证这些国家一定会致力于建立自由开放的市场。	Moreover, tools that may be used wisely and well by institutions with a global outlook, like the Fed and the Bank of England, could take on a different character in countries where a commitment to free and open markets cannot be taken for granted.
求职者可以用自身的工作实例和同僚/顾客的认可来扩展说明自己的教育资质和就业经历，并以此更加有效地让雇主认识到自身的潜在价值 。 。	Job seekers can augment their educational credentials and employment histories with samples of their work and endorsements from co-workers and customers, thereby conveying their potential value to employers more effectively.
在推动民主的过程中，今日统治者的这一言论遭到自由主义者的反对：第一届自由选举也将是最后一次，因为伊斯兰教主义者们将会赢得胜利并建立一个神权政体。	In promoting democracy, liberals reject the argument used by today’s rulers that the first free election would be the last, because Islamists would win and establish theocratic regimes.
首先，作为一个文化物种，人类利用信誉、成功、性、方言和种族等线索从群体中其他人那里获取思想、信仰、价值观和社会规范。	First, as a cultural species, humans acquire ideas, beliefs, values, and social norms from others in their communities, using cues of prestige, success, sex, dialect, and ethnicity.
他们的反应不难理解：即使是开玩笑地提及美国沦为“第二名”的可能性，也足以敲掉他们作为美国政客的饭碗。	Their reaction was understandable: even entertaining the possibility of the US becoming “number two” amounts to career suicide for an American politician.
尽管一些损失是拜信息技术和数字化所带来的生产率进步所赐，但也有许多损失的原因是公司将供应链的细分部分转移到了全球经济的其他地方，特别是中国。	Although some of the losses may have resulted from productivity gains from information technology and digitization, many occurred when companies shifted segments of their supply chains to other parts of the global economy, particularly China.
未来，从军用空中监测发展而来的技术将大量用于民用 — — 比如帮助控制交通、减少拥堵以及协助人道主义救援队的派遣。	In the future, technology developed for military aerial surveillance could have major civilian benefits – for example, helping to control traffic and reduce road congestion, and assisting in the dispatch of rescue teams and humanitarian assistance.
无论上述状况是否合理，这样的企业都加剧了收入不平等的上升 — — 进而造成制度绑架、媒体偏见和对选举不可忽视的影响。	Whether or not that is justified, such companies’ contribution to rising income inequality – and thus to regulatory capture, media bias, and disproportionate influence in elections – cannot be ignored.
所有国家 — — 不论发达国家还是发展中国家 — — 都能在为我们的孩子确保一个稳定的世界中起作用。	All countries – developed and developing – have a role to play in ensuring a stable world for our children.
那家以前叫做菲利普莫里斯（Philip Morris）的公司，目前正在类似的案件中起诉澳大利亚和乌拉圭（非TPP伙伴国）要求香烟加注警告标识。	Philip Morris International is currently prosecuting such cases against Australia and Uruguay (not a TPP partner) for requiring cigarettes to carry warning labels.
问题在于，拜行政限制、结构多元化不足和缺乏创新所赐，中国国内证券市场仍欠发达，而这三大问题在短期都很难取得进展。	The problem is that China’s domestic capital market remains underdeveloped, owing to administrative restrictions, a non-diverse structure, and a lack of innovation – all of which means that progress in the short term is unlikely.
恰恰相反，巴基斯坦的自由主义者勇敢地鼓动民主、法治以及要求穆沙拉夫负起责任，后者的总统位置似乎还没有得到稳固。	On the contrary, Pakistan’s liberals are brave to agitate for democracy, the rule of law, and accountability for Musharraf, whose presidency appears beyond rehabilitation.
其820亿美元的年度支出中有大约88%是直接补助（SNAP，或“食品券 ” ） ，只有0.33%用于为人们提供摆脱政府援助所需要的技能上。	Approximately 88% of its $82 billion in annual spending goes to direct aid (SNAP, or “food stamps”) while only 0.33% goes to providing people the skills they need to avoid government assistance.
如果他们不想拿全球金融稳定冒险与普京玩不可预料的懦夫博弈，也许更明智的做法是反思他们所实施的制裁的构成。	If they are not willing to risk global financial stability in an unpredictable game of chicken with Putin, perhaps it would be wise to re-think the composition of the sanctions that they impose.
作为联合国粮农组织布基纳法索项目的一部分，欧盟食品基金为10万名小农提供了优质粮食种子，使70万人得以在萨赫勒（Sahel）地区不断加剧的粮食危机中幸免于难。	As part of an FAO project in Burkina Faso, the EU’s Food Facility has helped to provide high-quality seeds to 100,000 vulnerable farmers, benefiting roughly 700,000 people amid the growing food crisis in the Sahel region.
几乎已经成为一种宗教的自由市场教条，强化了这一信念：市场是有效率的，如果他们付我这么多钱（就最近的例子来看，很可能是笔令人难以置信的数额 ） ， 那是因为我自己的效益值得了这个价。	The free-market doctrine, which has become almost a religion, reinforced this belief: markets are efficient, and if they pay me so much (a potentially mind-boggling amount, as seen in recent cases), it is because my own efficiency warrants it.
于是，西巴尔干申请入盟的国家不得不与新的程序纠缠。 与2004年的大爆炸相比，如今的入盟程序更多地建立在政府间的基础上，常常沦为成员国自私的双边要挟物。	The western Balkan applicants have thus had to contend with a process that is now managed on a more intergovernmental basis than was the big bang of 2004, and which has, at times, been held hostage to member states’ selfish bilateral demands.
但是在与统制他的国土的政权关系上他没有取得任何进展，而且他无力避免西藏不可避免地转化为中国的一个省。	But he has made no headway at all with the regime that rules his homeland, and he has been unable to prevent Tibet’s inexorable transformation into a Chinese province.
实现这一目标的一个办法是成立“工作委员会 ” ， 遴选雇员小组赋予其包括工作条件在内的信息和咨询权。	One way to achieve this is by establishing “works councils,” elected groups of employees with rights to information and consultation, including on working conditions.
首先，圣何塞官员将多个医疗机构合并为一个，并授予这个新机构拨款权和服务提供任务 — — 包括从接种到复杂手术的一切服务。	For starters, officials in San José merged multiple health-care agencies into one, giving the new body authority over financing decisions and service delivery – everything from vaccinations to complex surgeries.
强行撸下当选总统应该避免 — — 自由主义反对派本可以要求政府做出让步直到合法选举（定于今年晚些时候开始 ） ， 从而缓和公众愤怒。	The forcible removal of an elected president should have been avoided – the liberal opposition could have eased popular anger by demanding that the government make some concessions until legislative elections, which had been set for later this year.
如今在经历了半个世纪的军事或皇室独裁与军事伊斯兰教政权的竞争后，许多阿拉伯人开始再次寻找“第三条路 ” — —通向可信的代议制民主的道路。	Now, after a half-century of competition between military or royal dictatorships and militant Islamist regimes, many Arabs are again seeking a “third way” – a path toward a credible form of representative democracy.
发自伦敦 — — 放眼整个欧洲，几乎没什么人会对意大利的新任执政联盟 — — 其中包括走民粹主义路线的五星运动和民族主义的联盟党 — — 有几句好评。	LONDON – In Europe, hardly anyone has a good word to say about Italy’s upstart ruling coalition, which comprises the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) and the nationalist League party.
正如邓小平在1989年镇压了天安门广场的示威者一样，胡锦涛在两个月前平息了拉萨的反中央骚乱，表现得“坚决果断 ” 。	As Deng had crushed the protestors in Tiananmen Square in June of 1989, Hu had proven himself to be “firm and resolute” in quelling anti-Beijing riots in Lhasa, Tibet, two months earlier.
但是，好不容易排到了最前面，人们又往往面临严格的提款限制，因为政府之无能令人发指，在宣布决定之前根本没有印好足够的新钞。	But, upon getting to the front of the line, people were often met with strict withdrawal limits, because, in a display of shocking ineptitude, not enough new currency was printed prior to the announcement.
但当下关于全球性爆发的非传染性疾病（NCD，即心脏病、中风、糖尿病、癌症等慢性病）显然没有把这句话当回事。	Yet the current debate about the global epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) – chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer – has ignored this advice.
实际上，目前约三分之一的移民在发达国家之间流动；三分之一的移民在发展中国家之间流动；只有三分之一的移民在发展中国家和发达国家之间流动。	Indeed, roughly one-third of migrants nowadays move between developed countries; one-third move between developing countries; and only one-third move from the developing to the developed world.
因为女性劳动力对经济增长尤为重要，像国际货币基金组织这样的机构正致力于与世界各国政府合作，实现在经济领域为女性授权的目标。	Because women’s labor-force participation is so important for growth, organizations such as the IMF are committed to working with governments around the world to empower women economically.
在那里，特朗普赢得了去年11月的总统选举，他承诺选民要对穆斯林采取旅行禁令，在墨西哥边境筑墙，还要组建“驱逐力量 ” 。	There, Donald Trump won last November’s presidential election, having promised voters a travel ban on Muslims, a wall on the Mexican border, and a “deportation force.”
但是，这种鄙视却不得要领，因为大众娱乐时常包含有关个性、消费者选择以及其他具有重要政治影响的价值观念的图象和信息。	But such scorn is misplaced, because popular entertainment often contains subtle images and messages about individualism, consumer choice, and other values that have important political effects.
上个月，在朝鲜进行了今年夏天第二次洲际弹道导弹试射后，联合国安理会一致同意向这个蕞尔小国实施新的更加严厉的制裁。	Last month, following North Korea’s second intercontinental ballistic missile test of the summer, the United Nations Security Council unanimously agreed to impose new and even stricter sanctions on the tiny country.
他在很大程度是对的：考虑到它们其他需要优先考虑的事情和担忧，货币主管部门能采取的最好办法就是倚靠房地产的繁荣，而不是阻碍它的膨胀。	He is mostly right: the best thing that monetary authorities could have done, given their other priorities and concerns, is to lean against the real estate bubble, not stop it from inflating.
在这里，最糟糕的错误就是实行相反的政策 — — 即进行安抚极端分子或��试图软化他们的必定徒劳无益的努力。	The worst mistake would be to follow the opposite policy – an inevitably futile effort to appease the extremists or seek to moderate them.
瑟利夫在其诺贝尔奖获奖演说中指出 ， “ 重建一个几乎被战争和掠夺所摧毁的国家”是她最重要的政治使命。	As Sirleaf noted in her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, “rebuilding a nation nearly destroyed by war and plunder” was her greatest political priority.
而尽管二十世纪下半叶总统选举投票率从62%下降到50 % ， 但在2000年实现了企稳，并于2012年回升至58 % 。	And though voting rates in presidential elections declined from 62% to 50% in the latter half of the twentieth century, they stabilized in 2000, and rose to 58% in 2012.
在此次事件中 — — 同样也是民粹主义者的内塔尼亚胡 — — 因为不想疏远以色列在欧盟内部最忠诚的盟友而迫不及待地与法律与正义党政府解决冲突。	In the event, Netanyahu – a fellow populist – was eager to resolve the conflict with the PiS government, because he did not want to alienate Israel’s most loyal ally within the European Union.
华为首席财务官孟晚舟最近在加拿大被捕事件本身向外界表明：特朗普政府为达目的正在采用越来越残酷的方式。	The recent arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Canada itself raises the notion that the Trump administration is resorting to increasingly cutthroat methods to get its way.
1999年也发生过类似的情况，时任伊朗总统哈塔米试图进行改革试验，而石油价格下跌到每桶10美元以下。	A similar misfortune occurred in 1999, when President Mohammad Khatami was attempting to carry out his own reformist experiment, and prices fell below $10 per barrel.
因此当史无前例的极端气候发生之时，最主要的嫌疑犯自然就是过去数百年以来持续发生的重大大气变化 — — 而这就是由人类排放所导致的。	So, when unprecedented extreme weather events occur, the prime suspect is naturally the biggest atmospheric change that has happened over the past hundred years – one that has been caused by human emissions.
当时拉里•萨默斯任美国财政部副部长，他一再警告日本政府，一旦其推行上调消费税的计划，那么日本经济将重新陷入衰退。	Larry Summers, who was then Deputy Secretary of the United States Treasury, repeatedly warned the Japanese government that if it proceeded with a scheduled consumption-tax hike, Japan’s economy would slide back into recession.
聪明的选举宣传也起了作用 — — 以激励和希望为核心（当然也对伊斯兰主义掌权的后果进行了夸张 ） 。	So did a clever electoral campaign, which focused on incentives and hope (while also exaggerating the repercussions of an Islamist takeover).
其次，联合国应该兑现自己的承诺，对苏丹政府实施制裁，除非它停止用飞机轰炸村庄、停止为Jangaweed提供支持。	Second, the UN ought to make good on its threat and impose sanctions against the Sudanese government unless it stops using its aircraft to destroy villages and unless it stops supporting the jangaweed.
史蒂夫·努钦（Steve Mnuchin）仍然是财政部长，并且在最近的权力斗争的认识转换中独善其身。	Steve Mnuchin is still Treasury Secretary and has not been mentioned in dispatches during the latest power struggles.
这是对所谓“救援规则 ” （ Rule of Rescue）的应用：我们感到有责任倾尽所有拯救可证明身份的受害者，比如被困矿工、受伤登山者或极早产儿。	It is an application of the so-called “Rule of Rescue”: our perceived duty to spend almost any amount to save an identifiable victim, such as a trapped miner, an injured mountain climber, or an extremely premature baby.
这些毒品，再加上从缅甸运输到印度、中国、泰国和该地区其他国家的的海洛因，对我们的政治和经济安全造成严重威胁。	That, together with the heroin that is trafficked from Burma to India, China, Thailand, and other countries in the region, poses a serious threat to our political and economic security.
众多美国行业，其中也包括某些最具创新性的行业，均由少数几家大型企业所掌控，其中有些企业拥有极大规模的市场份额并能产生大大超过历史平均水平的利润。	Many US industries, including some of the most innovative, are dominated by a handful of large companies, some of which enjoy very large market shares and generate returns that greatly exceed historical averages.
现在的政府并没有说反对民主政治，只是说它来的不是时候，有必要推迟。 这种逻辑在大多数官方决策中昭然若揭。	The government does not say that it is against democracy, only that it is untimely and needs to be delayed – a logic that manifests itself in most official decisions.
尽管战争、冲突和暴行依然存在，但世界各大国总是试图 — — 有时也能成功，尽管局势混乱并且往往姗姗来迟 — — 阻止杀戮。	Although wars, conflicts, and atrocities continued, the global powers tried, and occasionally managed – albeit chaotically and usually late – to stop the killing.
叙利亚政权一直积极利用上述不确定情绪传播对埃及局势的恐惧，即世俗活动人士的缺乏导致国家被穆斯林兄弟会和圣战组织所占据。	The regime has been effective in exploiting that uncertainty by spreading the fear of an Egyptian scenario, in which the weakness of secular activists leads to a takeover by the Muslim Brothers and jihadis.
在MDG实施之前的十年中，该地区经济增长缓慢，贫困率居高不下（而且一直在上升 ） ， 疾病（包括HIV/艾滋病和疟疾）负担日益沉重。	In the ten years before the MDGs, economic growth in the region was slow, the poverty rate was high (and rising), and there was an increasingly heavy disease burden, including HIV/AIDS and malaria.
大部分决定国民福利的关键问题 — — 贸易、金融、法治精神、安全和环境 — — 至少在很大程度上取决于高效的地区和全球机构的存在。	Most key issues that are vital for national wellbeing – trade, finance, the rule of law, security, and the physical environment – depend at least as much on the presence of effective regional and global institutions.
而这种转化则有赖于三种形式的知识：工具所嵌入的知识；诀窍、手册和协议所蕴含的知识；以及隐性知识，或者存在于头脑中的诀窍。	And it depends on three forms of knowledge: embedded knowledge in tools; codified knowledge in recipes, manuals, and protocols; and tacit knowledge, or knowhow, in brains.
所谓的法国堕落理念令某些人极度痛苦，以至于他们欢迎1940年的德国入侵，并将其视为可以恢复男性美德的一种必要的震撼力量。	Some were so tormented by the idea of French decadence that they welcomed the German invasion in 1940 as a necessary shock that would restore manly virtues.
我们的观点会随着我们认知的加深而变化，但现在该税收的额度是基于一个道德问题：我们自认为究竟亏欠我们的子孙后代多少钱呢？	Our views will change as we learn more, but at the moment the size of the tax hinges on a question of moral philosophy: how much do we believe we owe our distant descendents?
20世纪90年代，残酷的宗教战争让阿尔及利亚陷入了分裂，大量原教旨主义阿拉伯穆斯林向南逃入广袤的撒哈拉沙漠 — — 马里正是撒哈拉沙漠的一部分。	In the wake of the ferocious religious war that tore Algeria apart in the 1990’s, a great number of Muslim fundamentalist Arabs fled south to the vast Sahara that covers part of Mali.
前印度外交部长辛哈（Yashwant Sinha）公开要求对驻印美国同性恋外交官予以相同待遇，根据最新的最高法院裁决，该美国外交官的性取向和国内安排是非法的。	A former Indian foreign minister, Yashwant Sinha, has publicly called for retaliation against gay American diplomats in India, whose sexual orientation and domestic arrangements are now illegal after a recent Supreme Court ruling.
2007年他曾提出过一个详细方案，该方案显然与阿卜杜勒国王有异曲同工之妙，其背景是，如果以色列政府决定通过单边撤出约旦河西岸大部保证以色列作为犹太国家的存在，将造成混乱的局面。	His elaborate 2007 plan, undoubtedly shared with King Abdullah’s consent, was spurred by the prospect of chaos should an Israeli government decide to secure Israel’s survival as a Jewish state through unilateral withdrawal from much of the West Bank.
这意味着粮食生产转移到别处，往往通过砍伐森林创造出的农业用地，从而释放出更多的二氧化碳并危及生物多样性。	That means that food production moves elsewhere, often to farmland created by cutting down forests, which releases more CO2 and damages biodiversity.
但金融市场第一次对欧盟某个银行的储户将会失去其部分存款这一新闻反应平静（在柏林和北欧一些地方这个消息被高兴地指了出来 ） 。	But financial markets reacted calmly to the news that, for the first time, even depositors in a bank in the European Union will lose part of their money (and this was noted with glee in Berlin and elsewhere in northern Europe).
中国人民银行可以允许人民币兑参考货币篮汇率每月贬值（比如）1 % ， 以提振中国出口商的竞争力并打消人民币被高估的担忧。	The People’s Bank of China can permit it to depreciate against the reference basket by, say, 1% a month, in order to enhance the competitiveness of Chinese exports and address concerns that the currency is overvalued.
彻底反思进化论免不了要引起神创论者的注意，他们欢欣鼓舞地宣称，如果达尔文主义的专业支持者都不能形成一致，那么这个概念肯定在式微。	Radically rethinking evolutionary theory invariably attracts the attention of creationists, who gleefully announce that if professional advocates of Darwinism cannot agree, the concept must be in retreat.
在教育方面，GCC国家K-12学校入学人数从2003年的270万增加到2012年的1,070万，年复合增长率为16.5 % 。	In education, enrollment in K-12 schools across the GCC rose from 2.7 million in 2003 to 10.7 million in 2012, a compound annual growth rate of 16.5%.
二十世纪四十年代末和五十年代初，冷战以及担心红色威胁将从内部削弱美国的决心产生难以计数的反颠覆项目，数以万计的美国人因此丢掉了生计。	In the late 1940’s and the 1950’s, the Cold War and fears that the Red Menace would sap American resolve from within led to myriad anti-subversive programs, with tens of thousands of Americans losing their livelihoods as a result.
在美国，2007年四季度到2010年二季度真实GDP下降1.6 % ， 此后直至2014年四季度增加10.5 % 。	In the US, real GDP fell by 1.6% from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2010, and then rose by 10.5% from then until the fourth quarter of 2014.
伯克利—几年前，我发现当今社会科学家都站在马基雅维利、洛克、斯密、托克维尔、马克斯·韦伯和涂尔干等巨人的肩上。	BERKELEY – Several years ago, it occurred to me that social scientists today are all standing on the shoulders of giants like Niccolo Machiavelli, John Locke, Adam Smith, Alexis de Tocqueville, Max Weber, and Émile Durkheim.
如IPCC这样的全球科学程序是至关重要的，因为它们在最大程度上给了我们期望，那就是在科学证据的基础上铸造共识。	Global scientific processes like the IPCC are critical, because they offer our best hope of forging a consensus based on the scientific evidence.
以上的计划是印度总统阿卜杜尔•卡拉姆博士雄心勃勃的与非洲e-Network计划中的一部分，目的是将印度的第三代医疗技术提供给非洲53个首都的医院。	This effort is part of then Indian President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam’s ambitious pan-African e-Network project to link all 53 African capitals to tertiary care facilities across India.
了解其“自身”客户的免于竞争的“无聊”银行将愿意多迈一步帮助其客户，因为这样做能够从客户身上榨取更多的油水。	A “boring” bank, shielded from competition and knowing that it “owns” its customers, would want to go the extra mile to help them, because it would get its pound of flesh from their future business.
在理想状态下，对单一核电站的保险费将与那些可能或不可能受影响的因素挂钩，比如核电站所在地的人口密度或者当地民众对风险的厌恶程度。	In this ideal world, insurance for individual plants would be linked to factors that can and cannot be influenced, such as location in a densely populated area and the local population’s risk-averseness.
幸运的是，对法西斯独裁的记忆让西班牙和葡萄牙能够对极右翼病毒免疫，而左翼反紧缩政党和地方主义者因此得福。	Fortunately, memories of fascist dictatorship may have inoculated Spain and Portugal against the far-right virus, with left-wing anti-austerity parties and regionalists benefiting instead.
显然，美联储的考虑是，既然增加2万多亿美元还不能形成渴望的结果，那么每个月再增加850亿美元 — — 今年再增1万亿 — — 可能就会有所成效吧。	Apparently, its rationale is that if expanding reserves by more than $2 trillion has not produced the desired results, adding $85 billion more monthly – another $1 trillion this year – might do the trick.
事实上，正是国大党政府进行的社会投资让更多的孩子得以上学，让更多的人能够工作，同时也确保了他们的基本需要得到满足。	In fact, it is precisely the social investment carried out by Congress governments that put more children in school and more people to work, while ensuring that their basic needs were met.
针对这一宏伟的长期目标，最新报告《中国2030：建设现代、和谐、富有创造性的高收入社会 》 （ China 2030: Building a Modern, Harmonious, and Creative High-Income Society）给出了一些2030年前我的祖国发展成熟、良好的市场经济所需要的改革建议。	In line with this bold, long-term approach, a new report, China 2030: Building a Modern, Harmonious, and Creative High-Income Society, proposes reforms that my country needs to develop a mature, well-functioning market economy by 2030.
其次，尽管拉美国家已经在若干领域奠定了可持续发展的基础，但仍有很多急待改革的领域，而多数拉美国家现在还不能避免一直困扰它们的繁荣萧条周期。	Second, although countries have laid the groundwork for sustainable growth in a number of areas, the reform agenda remains vast, and most countries are not yet able to avoid the boom-and-bust cycles that have long plagued them.
即使最有可能发生的事情是新兴市场债券崩溃无论如何都不会掀起大波澜，今天的精神过敏也应该作为警报，发达经济体也不能例外。	Even if the best bet is that any emerging-market bond meltdown would remain contained, today’s jitters ought to be a wake-up call, even for advanced economies.
接着，金融市场牛市所产生的财富效应应该能够��醒长期沉睡的“动物精神 ” ， 让消费者不顾依然困扰自己的资产负债表约束重新开始花钱。	The wealth effects generated by frothy financial markets are then presumed to rejuvenate long-dormant “animal spirits” and get consumers spending again, irrespective of lingering balance-sheet strains.
我们必须重新评估被扭曲的金融部门政治经济学，否则的话，少数人权力的过度膨胀将给其他所有人带来更大的负担。	We must re-evaluate the distorted political economy of the financial sector, before the excessive power of the few imposes even larger costs on everyone else.
但如果PH在新选举中表现足够强势，就可以让PAS政治边缘化，从而有望将马来西亚从伊斯兰教高人一等的有害政策中挽救出来。	A strong enough showing by PH in the next election, however, would expose the PAS as politically dispensable, potentially freeing Malaysia from a toxic game of Islamist one-upmanship.
在委内瑞拉的例子中，这些政策包括征用、价格和汇率管制、在繁荣期过度借贷、反商业监管、边境封闭，等等。	In Venezuela’s case, these policies included expropriations, price and exchange controls, over-borrowing in good times, anti-business regulations, border closures, and more.
像芯片和无源装置等电器产品制造大多已经完全转移到了亚洲，甚至连在德国境内组装的汽车也严重依赖于在东欧生产的零部件。	The manufacture of electrical products, such as chips and passive devices, has quite often been shifted completely to Asia, while even automobiles that are still assembled in Germany rely heavily on components produced in Eastern Europe.
由于昂贵的建造成本 — — 据估计高达10亿美元左右，美国决定不像英国那样建立国家级的生物银行，因此23andMe踌躇满志地认为不断增长的生物银行可以节省一大笔开支。	Given that the United States decided not to create a national biobank like the United Kingdom’s, owing to the high set-up costs – estimated at about a billion dollars – 23andMe may well view its growing biobank as saving it a massive outlay.
但小泉政府指责（其说法似乎也不无道理）韩国，特别是中国政府利用靖国神社事件来削弱日本的地区影响，煽动公众强烈的民族主义情绪的说法却显然并未切中要害。	But, while many Japanese feel (with some justification) that South Korea and, in particular, China, exploit the Yasukuni issue to reduce Japan’s influence in the region and to pander to their publics’ strong nationalism, they are missing the point.
许多这样的基金被称为“兀鹫基金 ” ， 因为它们以深度折价从原始债权人手中购买债务，期望通过法院裁决斩获丰厚利润。	Many are called “vulture funds” because they bought the debt at a steep discount from the original creditors, hoping to profit subsequently through court decisions.
在欧元启用后十年的今天，我们必须效法其创始人，以团结合作和雄心勃勃的精神，化危机为机遇，从而夯实欧洲“经济和货币联盟”的基石。	A decade after the euro’s introduction, we must follow the example of its founders and turn crisis into opportunity by uniting in a spirit of cooperation and ambition – and thereby reinforce the EMU’s foundations.
多数经济学家都倡议富国废除复杂、过时的税法，代之以简便易行的统一低税收制度，他们哀叹如此有效的税收制度，却没有几个国家真正愿意尝试。	Most economists advocate rich countries’ replacing their complex and antiquated tax codes with a simple low flat tax, and they bemoan the fact that so few countries have tried it.
对该项税收封顶可以防止税率不断上升，但带宽的增长会导致大部分用户很快就必须缴税，不但影响到最贫困消费者，也影响到新企业和小企业。	The cap on such a tax would prevent the rate from spiraling upward, but rising bandwidths would cause most users to max out quickly, affecting not only the poorest consumers, but also new or small businesses.
由于欧洲和美国由于不同的原因正在采取鼓励欧元大幅升值到危险水平的货币政策，因此，一场完美风暴正在形成。	The perfect storm is forming because both Europe and America, for different reasons, are following monetary policies that encourage the euro to rocket to dangerous levels.
这导致选民普遍抗拒建制派政治人物，从而促成2016年美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在竞选中的胜利，但他在获胜后，就开始利用选民的不满情绪出台仅有可能进一步加剧不平等的政策。	This contributed to voters’ rejection of establishment politicians, enabling the victory in 2016 of US President Donald Trump, who has since placed voter frustration in the service of enacting policies that may only exacerbate inequality.
无论特朗普的贸易战是想遏制中国还是仅仅因贸易行为而惩罚中国，但意想不到的结果是中国现在正在为迎接一个充满政治和经济挑战的新时代而自我武装。	Whether Trump’s trade war is about containing China or just about punishing it for its trade practices, the unintended consequence is that China is now fortifying itself for a new era of political and economic challenges.
我在担任克林顿总统经济顾问委员会主席时，反环保主义者试图实行类似的规定，称之为“监管性征收 ” （ regulatory takings ） 。	When I chaired President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers, anti-environmentalists tried to enact a similar provision, called “regulatory takings.”
在巴基斯坦的旁遮普省，过度抽水导致地下水位每年下降高达半米（二十英寸 ） ， 因为很难继续种植甘蔗和稻米这样的渴水植物而对今后的粮食和水安全构成威胁。	In Pakistan’s Punjab Province, over-pumping is lowering the water table by up to a half-meter (20 inches) per year, threatening future food and water security and making thirsty crops like sugarcane and rice tougher to grow.
我们在追求难以实现的伊拉克民主目标的过程中要牢记这一点。 那么，即将到来的大选一旦没能产生合法政府，我们就不会感到奇怪了。	We should remember this as we pursue the elusive objective of democracy in Iraq, so that we are not surprised if the upcoming election fails to generate a legitimate government.
尽管即将到来的特朗普任期充满了不确定性，但有一点是确定的，至少理论上如此：他处于十分有利的刺激美国经济增长的地位。	Despite the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s impending presidency, one thing is certain, at least on paper: he is in a strong position to boost US economic growth.
给克罗地亚和塞尔维亚施压，令其逮捕和交出嫌疑犯的做法—欧盟入盟谈判的条件之一—已经引发了几桩引渡，并还可能引发更多。	Pressure on Croatia and Serbia to arrest and hand over suspects – a condition of EU accession negotiations – has yielded several extraditions and may result in more.
老牌的跨国企业和它们的源起国需要为迎接新势力的挑战作出调整，还要适应这些新贵企业为世界市场带来的变化。	Established TNC’s, and their home countries, will need to adjust to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the world market.
据1991年曾任中央情报局局长的罗伯特·盖茨透露，在苏联垂死挣扎的过程中，那些赫尔辛基协定落实情况的监督者在击垮苏维埃帝国过程中所起的作用可能比中央情报局本身还要大。	According to Robert Gates, who became Director of the CIA in 1991, in the midst of the Soviet Union’s death throes, those who monitored compliance with the Helsinki Accords may have done more to bring down the Soviet empire than the CIA itself.
在提高了最低工资之后，下一步是扩大EITC，放松其所得和合规标准，提高其规模，使其适用于阶段薪酬而不是年度总额。	After raising the minimum wage, the next step is to expand the EITC, by broadening its income and eligibility criteria, increasing its size, and making it available in periodic payments instead of an annual lump sum.
目前，美国法律允许公司从应税利润中扣除所有雇员的工资，但排名最高的五名高管除外，他们的扣除金限定在100万年薪以内，除非其上的薪酬与“业绩挂钩 ” 。	Current US law allows businesses to deduct from their taxable income the wages of all employees, except the top five executives, for whom deductions are limited to $1 million of annual pay, unless the excess compensation is “performance-related.”
这将需要一种对确保促进和维持创造力所需环境的高度重视。 即将在3月份实施的更新后的“里斯本战略”也应该包括一个欧洲会朝着这一方向前进的承诺。	This will require an explicit emphasis on ensuring the conditions that promote and sustain creativity, and the updated Lisbon Strategy that is to be launched in March should include a commitment that Europe will move in this direction.
读读那些进步经济学家的文章，你会觉得，美国当前的所有问题都只需要向1%人群征税然后再分配给每个人就能解决。	Reading some progressive economists, it might seem that the answer to all of America’s current problems is to tax the 1% and redistribute to everyone else.
在迫切问题（比如叙利亚的国���压迫）和长期问题（比如气候变化）上无法达成共识凸显出全球治理和责任越来越复杂。	The inability to achieve a consensus on acute issues, such as Syria’s internal repression, or on chronic problems, like climate change, highlights the (increasing) complexity of global governance and responsibility.
最后一个挑战关系到一系列问题，这些问题需要政府对快速演进的技术进行监管，而政府并不一定具有进行有效监管的能力和资源。	The final challenge concerns a wide array of issues that require regulation of rapidly evolving technologies by governments that do not necessarily have the competence or resources to do so effectively.
自豪并且舒适地生活在他们自己狭小的国家里的荷兰人确实像瑞士人一样经常以一种自命不凡的眼光看待外部的世界。	It is true that the Dutch, proud and comfortable inside their narrow borders, have, like the Swiss, often viewed the outside world with a degree of smugness.
波厄（Poher ） 、 沙邦·戴尔马（Chaban-Delmas ） 、 巴利（Barre ） 、 巴拉迪尔（Balladur）还有我本人都在选举开始前两年就被媒体或明或暗地定为夺标热门，但我们最终都逃脱不了失败的厄运。	Poher, Chaban-Delmas, Barre, Balladur, and I were picked out by the media and treated as candidates for more than two years before the election, whether declared or not, and we were all eventually beaten.
因此，我们加入了一项全球计划，通过研究合作和发表的机会，为年轻的非洲学者提供参与政策导向方案的机会。	That is why we have joined a global initiative to provide young African researchers an opportunity to engage in policy-oriented solutions, through research collaboration and publishing opportunities.
对于欧盟在世界上的地位而言，此举还有一个额外益处，那就是一旦发展中国家的农民得到保证，将获得来自欧洲的公平待遇后，世界贸易组织陷于中止的多哈谈判就能重新启动。	A side benefit for the EU’s standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization’s stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe.
华盛顿—在大多数国家，身为“财政保守派”意味着你非常担心预算赤字和债务水平，并将这类问题置于政策日程的最优先位置。	WASHINGTON, DC – In most countries, to be “fiscally conservative” means to worry a great deal about the budget deficit and debt levels – and to push these issues to the top of the policy agenda.
而国际货币基金组织（IMF）提供了一个更好的答案：这样做对于投资供给不足的世界经济 — — 证据是利率处于创纪录低位 — — 大有裨益。	A better answer, offered by the International Monetary Fund, is that doing so would be good for a world economy in which investment is in short supply, as evidenced by record-low interest rates.
所得税抵免也得到了两党支持；该政策最初由共和党总统杰拉尔德·福特（Gerald Ford）颁布实施，并在两党继任者手中延续下来，包括罗纳德·里根，比尔·克林顿，小布什和奥巴马。	The EITC has bipartisan support; it was enacted under President Gerald Ford, and has been expanded under Republican and Democratic presidents alike: Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.
但强调点的转变 — — 包括十三五规划以及今年中国发展论坛的争论和吹风 — — 似乎是一个重要的信号。	But this shift in emphasis – in the 13th Five-Year Plan as well as in the debate and messaging at this year’s China Development Forum – appears to be an important signal.
此外，欧元区失业保持高企的唯一原因是劳动力参与率在整个衰退期间继续上升；而事实上，就业水平正在回归危机前水平。	Furthermore, the only reason why unemployment remains high in the eurozone is that the labor-force participation rate has continued to increase throughout the recession; and, indeed, employment is returning to pre-crisis levels.
尽管没有受很严重的伤，但是这件事反映了中国法律制度自相矛盾的地方，那就是，在过去二十年间，中国颁布了数百部法律，并且把“依法治国”提到意识形态和宪法上高度重视的地位。	The injuries proved minor, but the incident embodies the paradox of China’s legal system: over the past two decades, China has enacted hundreds of laws and elevated “ruling the country according to law” to ideological and constitutional prominence.
但正如廷托·卡德拉（Tito Cordella）和爱德华多·勒维·叶雅迪（Eduardo Levy Yeyati）在2006年所建议的那样，可以通过具体，可衡量和透明的标准来舒缓这类风险。	But, as Tito Cordella and Eduardo Levy Yeyati suggested in 2006, this risk could be mitigated by specific, measurable, and transparent criteria.
西方需要俄罗斯在处理像伊朗和朝鲜的核扩散、核材料和核武器的控制、与目前的激进伊斯兰恐怖主义浪潮的斗争、能源生产以及安全的问题进行合作。	The West needs Russian cooperation in dealing with issues like nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea, the control of nuclear materials and weapons, combating the current wave of radical Islamist terrorism, and energy production and security.
他将佛罗里达州前州长杰布·布什（Jeb Bush）称为“低能”人士，这严重挫伤了这位（甚至在他正式加入选战前就）被许多人当成最喜爱的候选人。	His depiction of former Florida governor Jeb Bush as a man of “low energy” has done real damage to a candidate whom many had assumed – even before he formally entered the race – would be the favorite.
呼吁进行全国大选虽然具有政治正确性，但却是一种政治自杀。 因为阿巴斯完全不明白这样做可能带来的后果并且在确保法塔赫的纪律方面也几乎无所作为。	Calling for national elections, while politically correct, was political suicide, for he lacked any idea of the possible outcome and did very little to ensure the discipline of Fatah.
但他们最好不要忽视另一场正在展开的斗争 — — 一场对欧洲和普京对欧洲大陆的施压能力具有深远长期影响的斗争。	But they would be wise not to overlook another unfolding struggle – one that will have profound long-term consequences for Europe and for Putin's ability to exert pressure on the continent.
年仅38岁的阿尔巴拉多（Alvarado）正在试图为哥斯达黎加创一个新的总统模式，这一模式不必修订宪法，而是从各方遴选部长。	Alvarado, who is just 38, is attempting to create a new presidential model for Costa Rica, without changing the constitution, by drawing ministers from a range of parties.
这些指标的开发还处在初级阶段，但其最终目标是开发实用的诊断工具，作为“MRI”供国家决策者评估国家全球风险抵抗力之用。	While the development of these metrics is in its early stages, the ultimate aim is to develop a practical diagnostic tool that would function as an “MRI” for national decision-makers to assess their countries’ resilience to global risks.
相反，纳粹在长剑之夜（Night of the Long Knives）捉住并处决了巴本的亲信助手赫尔伯特·冯·博斯（Herbert von Bose）和埃里克·克劳森纳（Erich Klausener ） ， 夺走政府控制权。	Instead, on the Night of the Long Knives, the Nazis hunted and executed Papen’s trusted associates, Herbert von Bose and Erich Klausener, and seized control of the government.
考虑到国际货币基金组织以及欧盟当前掌握的官方资源总量，他们一方面无法承受西班牙财政崩溃的后果，另一方面却又无力拯救如此庞大的一个国家。	Given the current level of official resources at the disposal of the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, Spain now seems too big to fail yet too big to be bailed out.
从上次危机爆发距今已有11年了，而下一场危机的到来只不过是时间问题 — — 这个现代资本主义经济的规律至少从1825年以来就是如此了。	It has now been 11 years since the start of the last crisis, and it is only a matter of time before we experience another one – as has been the rule for modern capitalist economies since at least 1825.
事实上，这类协议指导下的双边贸易流大概已经占到了全球进口量的半壁江山，也对贸易的大幅增长发挥了极大推动作用。	Indeed, bilateral trade flows covered by such agreements now amount to roughly half of the world’s imports, and have contributed significantly to the dramatic growth of trade.
随着中国经济的组成从投资向消费转变，商品密集型耐用品 — — 汽车、手机、室内水管、计算机和电视机等 — — 消费量将会增加。	As the composition of China’s economy continues to shift from investment to consumption, demand for commodity-intensive consumer durables – cars, mobile phones, indoor plumbing, computers, and televisions – will rise.
与反对这些概念的德国人相反，欧洲财政部和欧元债券不会也不应该会导致财政挥霍，而会也应该会复兴欧洲的投资拉动的绿色增长。	Contrary to the Germans who oppose such ideas, a European finance minister and Eurobonds would not and should not lead to fiscal profligacy, but rather to a revival of investment-led green growth in Europe.
尽管这些承诺虽然很多但大多并不昂贵（当然是与反对党所做的承诺相比 ） ， 但也未能成功传达政府对于财政责任的承诺。	Even the fact that these promises, though plentiful, were mostly inexpensive (certainly compared to those of the opposition) was not used to convey a commitment to fiscal responsibility.
比如，大型国有企业占了中国股市市值的三分之二，但它们只贡献了中国GDP的三分之一弱，对就业的贡献就更小了。	Majority state-owned firms account for two-thirds of the market value of the country’s exchanges, for example, though they are responsible for no more than one-third of Chinese GDP and an even smaller share of employment.
毕竟，意大利人、德国人和法国人工作时间相对较短，但工作努力且出色，因此拥有很高的单位时间生产率和工资 — — 比美国和英国都要高。	After all, the Italians, Germans, and French work hard and well over a relatively small number of hours, resulting in high hourly productivity and wages – higher than in the United States and the United Kingdom.
不仅如此，及时准确地通过化验确诊结核病及其耐药状况的工作也必须得到加强。 这需要发展基础设施，建立供需品采购、设备维护和人员培训及使用的可靠系统。	This will require infrastructure development, as well as reliable systems for procuring supplies, maintaining equipment, and training and retaining personnel.
不同国家可以选择不同战略，但所有国家都需要到达同一个终点：基于低碳资源、汽车电动化和智能节能建筑和城市的新的能源体系。	Different countries will choose different strategies, but we will all need to get to the same place: a new energy system built on low-carbon sources, electrification of vehicles, and smart, energy-efficient buildings and cities.
但是现在乌克兰国内广为流传的一种说法是尤什申科吃的食品中可能加有致命的蓖麻蛋白，这种药品曾经是克格勃刺客最喜欢的暗杀工具，他们在1978年用它在伦敦暗杀了保加利亚流亡领导人乔治·马可夫。	But it is now widely alleged in Ukraine that Yushchenko's food may have been laced with the deadly drug ricin, once a favorite of KGB assassins, who used it in the murder of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident, in London in 1978.
尽管Gagik Tsarukyan被控在苏联时代有过性犯罪行为，但是两年前亚美尼亚法庭取消了苏联法庭的判决宣布他为无罪。	For although Gagik Tsarukyan was convicted of a sexual crime in the Soviet era, two years ago Armenia’s courts exonerated him by vacating the decision of the Soviet court.
双边主义的残酷现实促使美国总统富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福和英国首相温斯顿·丘吉尔于1941年共同起草了《大西洋宪章 》 。	The brutality of bilateralism prompted US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to draft the Atlantic Charter in 1941.
实施良好的随机试验会对避免偏差现象注入额外的保障，包括使用安慰剂药物使调查者可以让病人及看护人不清楚到底是否正在接受积极治疗。	Well-conducted randomized trials incorporate additional safeguards against bias, including use of placebo medication that allows investigators to blind patients and caregivers to whether patients are, or are not, receiving active treatment.
但现在有一点非常明确，即二十世纪九十年代初到今天标志着从1914年萨拉热窝开始的进程高潮部分的展开。	But it is now clear that the subsequent period, between the early 1990s and today, marked the culmination of a process that began in Sarajevo in 1914.
监狱服刑人员数量极为庞大且不断增加，而政府在一个囚犯身上的年均支出竟然相等于该地一个中产家庭的税后年收入。	It has a vast and growing prison population, with annual spending on each incarcerated inmate equivalent to a middle-income California household’s after-tax income.
那么，穆尔西的“自动政变 ” （ auto-coup）是实现革命的公开目标 — — 民主的必要条件吗？	So, was Morsi’s “auto-coup” necessary to realize the revolution’s avowedly democratic goals?
其他人被告知，为了避免落入这一摧毁灵魂的“朝不保夕族 ” （ precariat ） ， 他们必须时时刻刻投资于个人品牌。	The rest are told that, to avoid falling into this soul-destroying “precariat,” they must invest in their own brand every waking hour of every day.
华盛顿 — — 欧洲历史上8月一直是个危险的月份，但今年却有可能成为欧元区 — — 甚至世界经济的转折点。	WASHINGTON, DC – August has been a dangerous month in European history, but this year it could be the turning point for the eurozone – and perhaps for the world economy.
即使合理地估计了来自经济增长的税收收入增量，他仍然需要通过控制支出，特别是福利支出与其减税计划匹配。	If properly scored to account for increased tax revenue from economic growth, he would still need to pair his tax cuts with controls on spending, and especially on entitlements.
他们应该说 ， “ 我们有95%的把握认为，在此期间内伊拉克的死亡人数大致增长了8，000至194,000人”才更准确。	They should have said, “We can say with 95% certainty that between 8,000 and 194,000 excess Iraqi deaths occurred during the period.”
俄国暴露了我们这个时代的一个丑陋的真相，那就是，非开明的社会可以像公开化社会一样快地增长，甚至还要更快。	Russia exposes an ugly truth of our era: illiberal societies can grow just as fast – even faster – than open ones.
奥巴马的前任小布什发动了所谓的“反恐战争”以打击他所坚称的意在“建立从西班牙一直延伸到印度尼西亚的极端伊斯兰帝国”的组织。	Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, launched America’s so-called “war on terror” to defeat groups that he insisted wanted to “establish a radical Islamic empire that spans from Spain to Indonesia.”
因为，即便是面对像中国这样的“战略竞争者 ” ， 我们还是应该想到我们共有一个地球，我们分享着空气、水、工业品甚至是食品。	For, even with “strategic competitors” like China, we now live in a global commons in which we share air, water, manufactured goods, and even food.
如果由20国集团共同承担，这笔钱数量很小，而且会是一项相当不错的投资 — — 尤其考虑到当前仅抗生素耐药性一项就耗费美国医疗系统每年200亿美元的开支。	Shared among G-20 governments, this is very little money, and would be a remarkably good investment – especially given that antibiotic resistance currently costs the US health-care system alone about $20 billion per year.
当通货膨胀率较低，当务之急应该是降低失业率到尽可能低的水平；同时也并没有令人信服的理由让货币政策去抑制创造就业或GDP的增长，除非过度通胀变得迫在眉睫。	When inflation is low, the top priority should be to reduce unemployment to the lowest possible level; and there is no compelling reason for monetary policy to restrain job creation or GDP growth until excessive inflation becomes an imminent danger.
改变世界所需要的并非真相，而是另一种形式的，为另一派利益服务的宣传，一切都是政治，这就是唯一的真相。	What is necessary to change the world is not the truth, but another form of propaganda, promoting different interests. Everything is political.
平心而论，积极主动的减贫计划、宽松的信用、商品出口繁荣和大手笔政府支出（通过同样大手笔的税收融资）让几百万人摆脱了贫困。	To be sure, pro-active anti-poverty programs, loose credit, a commodity-export boom, and heavy government spending (financed by an equally heavy tax burden) lifted millions out of poverty.
当然，1990年代和平进程的失败，以及随后发生的第二次占领区巴勒斯坦人暴动似乎都加剧了以色列内部激进派的极端程度并打击了温和派。	Certainly, the failure of the peace process in the 1990’s, followed by the coming of the second Intifada, appears to have encouraged the radicalization of Israel’s extremes while discouraging moderates.
具备此种特征的发展中国家可以在一代人的时间内，将要素禀赋由劳动力充足型或资源丰富型转变为资本充足型。	Developing countries with such characteristics are able to turn factor endowments from relatively labor- or resource- abundant to relatively capital-abundant in the span of a generation.
在发展中国家城市和非正式住所 — — 在这些场所传染病传播起来更加容易 — — 快速增长的背景下，这一需要尤其迫切。	This is especially urgent in light of the rapid growth of cities and informal settlements – where infectious diseases can spread more easily – in developing countries. We need to start creating those plans now.
看到成千上万的人参与这场辩论是一个振奋人心的事情，因为如果没有大众的参与，安全就是难以界定的问题，而那些迫在眉睫的重要改革也会缺乏政治合法性。	It is encouraging to see that many thousands are indeed getting involved, because without popular engagement, security will remain undefined, and the important reforms that are needed will lack political legitimacy.
班加西 — — 中东的独裁统治者总是警告人们一旦其政权被推翻就会造成血流成河、西方占领、贫穷、混乱和基地组织肆虐的后果。	BENGHAZI – Middle Eastern autocrats routinely warn their people of rivers of blood, Western occupation, poverty, chaos, and Al Qaeda if their regimes are toppled.
全球实力正在发生变迁，美国也因国内碳氢化合物产量增加而走向能源自给，在这样的背景下，美国将调整外交政策，以适应新的多极国际秩序。	Given the shift in global power and the prospect of US energy self-sufficiency as domestic hydrocarbon output booms, America is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi-polar international order.
新德里—在全球媒体未予关注之处，尼泊尔正在经历一场宪政危机。 这场危机可能导致这个位于印度和中国之间敏感地带的旅游胜地陷入全面的冲突。	NEW DELHI – Away from the glare of global headlines, Nepal is grappling with a constitutional crisis that could once again propel the tourist mecca, sensitively situated between India and China, into full-fledged conflict.
在ISIS（伊拉克和叙利亚伊斯兰国，其指导思想和行为极端到连基地组织都无法认同）的残酷路线下，什叶派和其他非逊尼派有充分的理由担心受到凶残暴力。	Shia and other non-Sunnis in the path of the marauding ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) – a group whose ideology and behavior are too extreme even for Al Qaeda to stomach – have plenty of reason to fear such atrocities.
但这让中国陷入了难以自拔的泥潭：每单位产出所提供的工作岗位越来越少，这就需要更多的产出来吸收多余的劳力。	But it left China in a deepening hole: increasingly deficient in jobs per unit of output, it needed more units of output to absorb its surplus labor.
教育公众，使之理解这一复杂的全球信息时代以及在这样一个时代获得成功所需要的条件才是真正的变革型领导任务。	Educating the public to understand this complex globalized information age, and what is required to operate successfully in it, will be the real transformational leadership task.
有效动员一个团体的能力肯定是艺术，而非可以预测的科学；这种能力视情境而定，但这并不表示对它的研究与学习得不偿失。	The ability to mobilize a group effectively is certainly an art rather than a predictive science, and varies with situations, but that does not mean that it cannot be profitably studied and learned.
在过去20年间，对欧盟成员国资格的追求已经被证明是一笔对西巴尔干地区稳定，民主和现代化贡献良多的宝贵资产。	Over the last 20 years, the goal of EU membership has proved an invaluable asset for stabilizing, democratizing, and modernizing the western Balkans.
由于目前布什政府花销无度(以及克林顿政府的勤俭 ) ， 在进行统计的时间内，在共和党当政时期联邦开支占GDP的平均比例现在超过了民主党当政时期。	Thanks to the profligacy of the current Bush administration (and the prudence of the Clinton administration), average Federal spending as a proportion of GDP under Republican presidents now exceeds that under Democrats during the measured period.
相反，中国的真实增长是巴西和俄罗斯的三倍，但其贸易条件实际恶化了26 % ， 因为其出口制造品变得更便宜了，而进口的大宗商品变得更贵了。	By contrast, China’s real growth was three times that of Brazil and Russia, but its terms of trade actually deteriorated by 26%, because its manufactured exports became cheaper while its commodity imports became more expensive.
只有一份关于难民问题的可以接受的协议才能合上1948年档案 — — 巴勒斯坦冲突只有到那时才会结束。	Only an acceptable deal on the refugees can definitely close the 1948 file – and only then can the conflict in Palestine end.
上述重新投入市场怀抱的政策让人联想起1979年邓小平最初那次资本主义转向，当时的政策令中国根深蒂固的企业及政府精英一直如骨鲠在喉。	This renewed embrace of the market, reminiscent of Deng Xiaoping’s original turn to capitalism in 1979, will be hard medicine for China’s entrenched business and government elites to swallow.
1891-1979年期间（在Volcker监察到借款成本急剧上升之前刚结束的这段时期）的平均实际长期政府利率仅为1.25 % 。 这和现今的实际长期利率非常接近。	The average real long-term government interest rate in 1891-1979 – a period ending just before Volcker oversaw soaring growth in borrowing costs – was a mere 1.25%, which is very close to the real long-term interest rate today.
首先，随着住房等资产价格在全球市场流动性的推动下上涨，商品价格因过剩的生产力和全球贸易而低迷不振，以及利率随着投资的萎缩而下降，很容易出现国内和对外收支不平衡的现象。	First, with asset prices like housing fueled by global liquidity, goods prices kept quiescent by excess capacity and global trade, and interest rates held down by muted investment, domestic and external imbalances have been easily financed.
我成长在一个从贫困奋斗到中产接近的家庭中，长大后，我学习了法律，并在哈佛大学完成了一项非政府组织管理培训计划。	Having grown up in a family that struggled to rise from poverty to the middle class, I went on to study law and completed an NGO-management training program at Harvard University.
他正在进行权衡：一边进一步肢解乌克兰、将其中一部分并入俄罗斯或称为俄罗斯附庸国；另一边是更严厉、更全面的经济制裁带来的痛苦。	He is weighing the value of further dismemberment of Ukraine, with some pieces either joining Russia or becoming Russian vassal states, against the pain of much stronger and more comprehensive economic sanctions.
果真如此的话，查韦斯的指定接班人马杜罗将在即将到来的选举中轻松击败反对派候选人卡普里莱斯（Henrique Capriles ） 。	In that case, Chávez’s designated successor, Nicolás Maduro, will make short work of opposition candidate Henrique Capriles in the upcoming election.
发自莫斯科 — — 让我们想象一个把自己伪装成19世纪俄国男爵的怪人：他留着连鬓胡子，穿一身双排扣礼服，手里还柱着一根手杖。	MOSCOW – Imagine a crank who tries to pass himself off as a nineteenth-century Russian baron. He grows sideburns, wears a long frock-coat, and carries a walking stick.
与此同时，发展中国家可能要采取临时保护措施，促进当地私有部门和“稚嫩工业”的发展，这可以让他们在自由化的道路上逐渐扩大生产规模。	At the same time, developing countries may need to promote local private sectors and “infant industries” through temporary protectionist measures, which would help them to upgrade their output on the road to liberalization.
欧洲需要让微软和英特尔这样的公司在布鲁塞尔、巴黎或者柏林都有一种在家里的感觉，而不是成为向市场竞争中的失败者提供富有同情心的裁决的一个政治市场领导者。	Europe needs to make the likes of Microsoft and Intel feel at home in Brussels, Paris, or Berlin, not to become a political market leader in supplying sympathetic verdicts to market losers.
今年3月埃博拉病毒爆发后，一家独立的非营利性研究机构巴斯德研究所一直致力于了解这种病毒并研究治疗方案。	Since the outbreak of the virus in March, the Institut Pasteur, an independent, non-profit research organization, has worked to understand how the virus can be contained and what treatment can be offered.
而在短短两年内允许150万移民入境也给德国的福利国家制度带来了沉重负担，无心插柳地鼓动了英国退欧派，也激起了东欧国家的全体反对。	By admitting 1.5 million migrants in just two years, Germany has also placed a massive burden on its welfare state, inadvertently encouraged the Brexiteers, and rallied all of Eastern Europe against it.
对经济学家来说，艺术品泡沫带来很多令人着迷的问题，但其中又有趣味的一个正是谁会花这么多钱买高端艺术品。	For economists, the art bubble raises many fascinating questions, but an especially interesting one is exactly who would pay so much for high-end art.
拉贾斯坦邦的比卡内尔（Bikaner）城市集群富于含油种子和Makarana大理石和石灰石的开采和制造。	The Bikaner cluster in Rajasthan is rich in oilseed and the quarrying and production of Makarana marble and limestone.
（雪铁戈这个品牌在我的家乡马萨诸塞州波士顿特别有名，该公司的标志性招牌已成为芬威公园球场周边地区的地标，也是波士顿红袜棒球队的主场。	(The Citgo brand is especially famous in my hometown of Boston, Massachusetts, where the company’s iconic sign has become a landmark in the environs of Fenway Park, where the Red Sox baseball team plays.)
美国作为 全球领导者的作用肯定将受到影响，其“软实力”亦然。 美国的软实力来自此前作为其他国家效仿的自由民主榜样。	America’s role as a global leader will surely suffer, as will the “soft power” that it previously derived from being a model of liberal democracy for others to emulate.
目前还没有证据表明欧元区存在大规模的次级房屋贷款，但是有大量证据表明，尽管各国情况不同，住房价格还是对国内需求有着重大的影响。	While there is little evidence in the euro area of large-scale sub-prime lending, there is considerable evidence to suggest that house prices have an important impact on domestic demand, albeit with wide variations among individual countries.
但在完成就职演说一年半后，奥巴马“伸出的双手”已经握成了拳头，而他鼓励以巴谈判的目标似乎也陷于停滞。	But a year and a half after his inauguration, Obama’s “outstretched hand” to Iran has turned into a fist, and his attempts to encourage Israeli-Palestinian negotiations seem stuck.
比如应十九世纪初纺织业机械化而起、摧毁新技术的卢德派和工人摧毁打谷机的施荣暴动（Swing Riots ） 。	Recall the Luddites, who responded to the early nineteenth-century mechanization of the textile industry by smashing the new technology, and the Swing Riots, in which workers destroyed threshing machines.
以美式和平为代表的国际秩序在世界从二战废墟中崛起时充分发挥了作用，但后来却导致了两个超级核大国之间的长期冷战，现在这一秩序可能已不足以维护世界和平，而且可能阻碍了人们做出更好的调整。	An international order that made complete sense when the world was emerging from the ruins of World War II, only to enter a long Cold War between two nuclear superpowers, may no longer be adequate, and may stand in the way of better arrangements.
国内和国际的收入分配将会更加均衡，社会服务包括教育将会更好，建设性的能源政策将会引导在替代能源和节能方面的大规模投资，军费开支缩减，发展中国家更快速的增长将会提供更好的出口市场和投资机会。	A constructive energy policy leading to large-scale investments in alternative energy and energy saving. Reduced military expenditures.
但即便对于个别经济部门来说相对较大的统计效应对季度GDP的影响也相对较小 — — 至少在短期内是如此。	But it is also true that even relatively large statistical effects for individual economic sectors tend to have a relatively small impact on quarterly GDP, at least in the short run.
这一利润来源将随着利率上升而消失，某些企业 — — 比如私募基金 — — 也需要重组其依赖廉价资本的经营模式	This source of profit growth will disappear as interest rates rise, and some firms will need to reconsider business models – for example, private equity – that rely on cheap capital.
物理学定律的美首先植根于它们的对称性（symmetry ） — —这里意味着不变之变的可能性 — — 一个精确的，但几乎是神秘的概念。	Their beauty is rooted, first, in the laws’ symmetry, here meaning the possibility of change without change – a precise yet almost mystical concept.
那么，难怪比起依靠国际货币基金组织提供快速、不太昂贵以及可靠的金融援助来，其成员国更多的依靠它们自己的能力来积累储备资金。	No wonder, then, that members rely more on their capacity to accumulate reserves than on the Fund’s ability to provide opportune, affordable, and reliable financial support.
哈萨克斯坦产出扩张了500%多，印尼、尼日利亚、埃塞俄比亚、卢旺达、乌克兰、智利、哥伦比亚、罗马尼亚和越南也都增长了200%以上。	Kazakhstan’s output expanded by more than 500%, while Indonesia, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Ukraine, Chile, Colombia, Romania, and Vietnam grew by more than 200% each.
了解癌症病患基因的这一关键信息能够显著降低因使用无效药物而产生不必要的副作用（和经济负担）的患者数量。	Knowing this crucial information about a cancer patient’s genes will reduce sharply the number who are unnecessarily subjected to the side effects (and expense) of drugs that will not work.
这一减速是难以避免的，因为中国已经从极端贫困和科技落后中走出，成为受对外贸易和消费支出驱动的中等收入经济体。	This deceleration was inevitable as China advanced from extreme poverty and technological backwardness to become a middle-income economy powered by external trade and consumer spending.
如果反贸易政策的政治诉求能最终站稳脚跟的话，这将标志着全球经济事务中的一个历史性转折，并为美国未来领导角色的衰败埋下祸根。	If the political appeal of anti-trade policies proves durable, it will mark a historic turning point in global economic affairs, one that bodes ill for the future of American leadership.
而且，超过60%的死亡都发生在发展中国家，非传染性疾病越来越多的发生在年轻群体中，这大大地暗示了一国生产劳动力的情况。	Moreover, more than 60% these deaths occur in the developing world, and here NCD's increasingly appear in younger age groups, which can have huge implications for how productive a country's workers are.
欧洲共同货币之坚挺，反映了世界其他地方也是问题缠身，也使有利于信心恢复与经济复苏的欧元汇率难以出现。	The common currency’s strength reflects problems elsewhere in the world, but a euro exchange rate that would enable the return of confidence and growth is no less elusive for that.
即便统治者会反对那些会损害其民粹主义议程的政策 — — 如高利率 — — 但也常常会屈服于金融市场的压力。	Even when rulers rant against policies that will hurt their populist agendas – like high interest rates – they typically succumb to pressure from financial markets.
尽管英国石油公司成功地将一小截油管插入主渗漏口并吸走了部分渗漏的原油，但“深水地平线”油井仍然不停地向墨西哥湾喷涌原油。	Deepwater Horizon is still spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico, even though BP has succeeded in inserting a smaller pipe into the main leakage to suck off part of the flow.
除政府合作外，美印两国的企业、非政府组织和公民个人的活力与创造力是印美两国相互作用和对世界贡献的关键。	Beyond government cooperation, the creativity and dynamism of businesses, NGOs and private citizens in both countries hold the key to what India and the US can offer each other and the world.
但是作为一名生活在非洲大陆最重要的发展伙伴之一中国的肯尼亚人，我看到有一个衡量标准导致天平向津巴布韦倾斜：那就是这个国家与我第二故乡的关系。	But as a Kenyan living in China, one of the African continent’s most important development partners, I see one metric that tips the scale in Zimbabwe’s favor: its relationship with my adopted home.
没能促进性别平等、投资于教育以及采取更广泛的治理和监管的落后国家有可能在获取全球化的巨大收益方面进一步落后。	Lagging countries that fail to promote gender equality, invest in education, and adopt broader governance and regulatory reforms risk falling even further behind in reaping the significant benefits of globalization.
在1945年到2007年这62年里，尽管受到了一些强烈（但是短期且且仅限于某些区域）的冲击，企业家和创业者依然相信只要他们能创造出供给，需求就会出现。	For 62 years, from 1945-2007, with some sharp but temporary and regionalized interruptions, entrepreneurs and enterprisers could bet that the demand would be there if they created the supply.
但各国不但没有落实旨在实现上述目标的政策，反而继续在补贴化石燃料工业的同时，利用稀缺的公共资源探寻新的储量。	But instead of implementing policies aimed at realizing that objective, governments continue not only to subsidize the fossil-fuel industry, but also to use scarce public resources to find new reserves.
诺贝尔经济学奖的最高决定者是斯托克霍姆大学经济学家阿萨尔·林德贝克（Assar Lindbeck ） ， 他以前是社会民主中人。	The prize kingmaker was Stockholm University economist Assar Lindbeck, who had turned away from social democracy.
因此在投票前八天，美国通过三年前建立的一条连接了两国减少核风险中心（Nuclear Risk Reduction Center）的热线 — — 专责处理重大网络事件 — — 向俄罗斯发出了停止干涉选举的警告。	So, eight days before the vote, the US sent Russia a warning about election meddling over a hotline – created three years earlier to deal with major cyber incidents – that connects the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in both countries.
如果大众能对防止未来破坏而募捐的款项有所回应固然很好，但实现这件事的可能性也很小，因为这项提议缺乏那种援助突发事件受害者所具有的情感推动力。	It would be excellent if the general public responded to an appeal for funds for mitigating future damage. But the prospects of that happening are slim, because such an appeal would lack the emotional pull of the desire to help immediate victims.
鉴于前任总统哈塔米是改革运动的支持者—虽然怯懦使他终究一事无成—这就更加突出说明了统治者们是如何彻底地操控了政治局势。	Given the fact that the last president, Muhammad Khatami, was a supporter of the reform movement – albeit a timid one who ultimately accomplished nothing – only underlines how thoroughly the rulers turned around the political situation.
自金融危机开始爆发以来，全球债务比率急剧升高，而传统贷款人的利润率受到挤压，导致它们的总体健康情况也出现了问题。	Global debt ratios have risen sharply since the financial crisis began, while traditional lenders’ margins have been squeezed, raising questions about their overall health.
毕竟17个欧元区成员国中的绝大多数都背负着沉重债务负担，都渴望寻找一些在财政上可靠的方式去推动增长。	After all, because most of the eurozone’s 17 member states suffer from heavy debt burdens, they are all anxious to find fiscally responsible ways to promote growth.
在实际消费增长徘徊在1%轨道的情况下，大部分美国人眼中的经济复苏和就业保障显然与那些迷恋财富效应的人截然不同。	With real consumption stuck on a 1% growth trajectory, the bulk of the US population understandably views economic recovery and job security very differently from those enamored of wealth effects.
与诺贝尔奖获得者若泽·萨拉马戈的评论恰好相反，以军对加沙地区的袭击在任何方面都无法和纳粹奥斯维辛集中营相提并论。	Contrary to what the Nobel Prize-winning author José Saramago once said, the Israeli army’s attacks in Gaza are not comparable in any way to Auschwitz.
一代又一代日本人都走在一条简单的道路上 — — 自由、人权和法治精神之路，未来一代又一代日本人将继续走这条路。	Many generations of Japanese have walked a single path – that of freedom, human rights, and the rule of law – and we will continue to walk this path for generations to come.
冷战极大地阻碍了自由国际主义的全球化野心，而这是与地缘政治意义上的西方（特别是美英两国）密切联系的信条。	The Cold War greatly damaged the globalizing ambition of liberal internationalism, a creed closely associated with the geopolitical West, and especially with the US and the UK.
成功的关键是明智的合作：公共与私人部门之间的合作；政府和公民社会之间的合作；国与国之间的合作；国家与国际组织之间的合作。	The key to success will be smart cooperation: between the public and private sectors; between government and civil society; among countries; and between countries and international organizations.
最高领袖哈梅内伊在2009年呼吁大学“伊斯兰化 ” ， 导致大学课程有所修改，一些学者也被更保守的人物代替了。	Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s call in 2009 for the “Islamization” of universities led to courses being changed and the replacement of some academic staff by more conservative figures.
在2010年4月的《世界经济展望》中，IMF预测2012—2013年英国年经济增长率为近3 % ； 目前的预测是今年GDP可能出现下降，明年大约也只能增长1 % 。	The April 2010 WEO forecast a UK annual growth rate of nearly 3% in 2012-2013; instead, GDP is likely to contract this year and increase by roughly 1% next year.
品心而论，利比亚确实有一个得到国际承认的政府：位于的黎波里的国民协商政府（Government of National Accord，GNA ） ， 它源于2015年在联合国的主持下在摩洛哥斯希拉特（Skhirat）签署的利比亚政治协定。	To be sure, Libya does have an internationally recognized government: the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), born of the December 2015 Libyan Political Agreement, signed in Skhirat, Morocco, under the auspices of the United Nations.
1999年10月，穆沙拉夫把谢里夫从第二届任期中赶下了台，成立了巴基斯坦第四界军事政权。 在这次兵变后，贝布托和谢里夫逃亡海外。	Pakistan these days is a troubled country, politically as well as economically.
我知道欧盟的轮值主席国德国也对条约抱有“雄心 ” ， 正在努力寻找在本月的欧洲理事会上走出目前的停顿方式。	The EU’s German Presidency, which I know shares the “ambitious” view of the Treaty, is working hard on finding a way out of the deadlock at this month’s European Council.
乐观者所想象的景象是生产合理、管网建设完全、电网互通，玻利维亚、阿根廷和其他地方的天然气能提振整个南美大陆的增长，并让所有人在此过程中受益。	Optimists imagine a scenario in which production is rationalized, pipelines are built, grids are interconnected, and gas from Bolivia, Argentina, or elsewhere fuels growth throughout the continent, benefiting everyone in the process.
但尽管俄罗斯退休基金确实存在很大缺口，国家补贴占总整合预算的比例还不到10 % — —比每年石油价格波动导致的变化还要少。	But, while Russia’s pension fund does have a massive shortfall, state subsidies to it amount to less than 10% of the total consolidated budget – less than the fluctuation caused by changes in oil prices each year.
去年6月，金正日政府在退出六国会谈时，就以日本政府对20世纪70年代和80 年代北朝鲜间谍劫持日本公民事件的立场来证明了这一点。	The same goes for Japan, whose stance on the abduction of its citizens by North Korean agents in the 1970’s and 1980’s was also cited by the Kim regime last June as a reason for walking out of the six-party talks.
如果公民教育得到正确的开展，它不仅非常耗时而且会分散人们对短期内看似更为有用的主题的关注，所谓短期内更为有用的含义是人们认为上述主题可以更为直接的助推经济成功。	If done properly, it is also very time-consuming and thus detracts from subjects that appear more useful in the short run, in the sense that they are supposed to contribute more directly to economic success.
现在，再过几个月我就将开始福特汉姆大学（Fordham University ）法学院的研究生生涯，这是我的祖国的昔日童军不敢想象的命运。	Now, in just a few months, I will begin graduate classes at the Fordham University School of Law, an unimaginable destination for most of the former child soldiers in my country.
如果不存在这些偏见，对女子项目的需求 — — 用看台上座率、电视转播率等指标衡量 — — 就能和男子项目等量齐观。	In the absence of these biases, demand for women’s sports – as measured by attendance at matches, television ratings, and so on – would equal demand for men’s sports.
布什政府不仅不承认高昂的燃料价格是促进节能和能源创新的最佳途径，反倒为美国的农民提供巨额补贴用于种植生物燃料生产的作物。	Rather than acknowledge that high fuel prices are the best way to inspire energy conservation and innovation, the Bush administration has instituted huge subsidies to American farmers to grow grains for bio-fuel production.
贷款规模从100元到100万元不等，贷款目标是目前难以通过传统机构获得信用的中小企业以及个人借款人。	Loans can range from CN¥100 ($16) to CN¥1 million, and target small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), as well as individual borrowers, that currently struggle to access credit through traditional institutions.
其次，美联储应该改变口风，并在必要时改变政策以反映其行动会极大地影响他国从而反过来影响美国经济的事实。	Second, the Fed should adjust its rhetoric and, if necessary, its policies to reflect the fact that its actions disproportionately affect other countries, with repercussions on the US economy.
而 这恰好也是人们面对银行家巨额分红时的反应 , 尤其在 2007-2008 年的大海啸将银行 , 企业 , 股东的积蓄 , 国家的增长和人们的工作毁于一旦的时候。	That is pretty much how most people reacted to the stories about bankers’ bonuses, when the great crash of 2007-2008 wiped out banks, businesses, shareholders’ savings, growth, and jobs.
但是，金融稳定性委员会应该认识到监管差异并通过众多标准设置机构激励更加积极的工作，但不应该插手日常操作。	But, while it should identify regulatory gaps and encourage more proactive work by the various standard-setting bodies, it should not take on daily operational responsibilities.
他们公开谴责“苏维埃选举行为 ” ， 他们反对暴君统治和贪污腐败的结合体。 这恰恰是曾经的苏维埃政权和当今的俄罗斯政权所具有的典型特征。	They want to express to Russia’s rulers the extent of their frustration and determination.
不仅法国领导人重建多极世界的讲话令人惊恐，最近的民意测验也表明美国在欧洲的受欢迎程度日益下降，以及欧洲人对独立自主政策越来越强烈的渴望。	Not only do the remarks of French leaders about recreating a multi-polar world arouse alarm, but recent public opinion polls show a decline in the popularity of the US among Europeans and a desire for more independent policies.
我们一定要记住：不管是谁作出了抓捕英国水兵的决定，他都是为了让冲突升级，以便既巩固其国内地位，同时也是对已经开始对其产生严重影响的国际制裁的回击。	It is important to remember: those who were responsible for taking the British Marines captive wanted an escalation of the confrontation, both to improve their domestic standing, and to punch back for sanctions that were beginning to bite.
同时，尽管有必要进行财政整顿，但鉴于���前经济状况，乌克兰最弱势民众现在正忍受着无隔夜粮的困难冲击。	And, although fiscal consolidation is necessary, given the state of our economy, Ukraine’s most vulnerable people are now enduring a hand-to-mouth existence.
同时，中国正力图投资20亿美金修建从缅甸南部海岸到中国云南省的输油管道，这将会使中国更方便和安全地将中东原油输送到南方各省。	At the same time, the $2 billion oil pipeline that China is seeking to build from Burma’s southern coast to China’s Yunnan province will allow China to get Middle East oil to its southern provinces more easily and securely.
据英国国家统计署统计，2015年法国的每小时产出比以前正常趋势增长率下应得的产出水平低了14 ％ 。	According to the UK’s Office for National Statistics, output per hour in France was 14% lower in 2015 than it would have been had the previously normal trend growth rate been matched.
反建制情绪高涨的主力军是劳动力之外的人群：退休者、中年家庭主妇和主夫以及享受残疾救济的教育程度较低的男性。	The main demographic groups behind the anti-establishment upsurge have been people outside the workforce: pensioners, middle-aged homemakers, and men with low educational qualifications receiving disability payments.
细菌可以快速繁殖和突变，并能建立某种类似“基因互联网”的网络，允许某些病原菌“下载”抗生素耐药基因。	Bacteria can reproduce and mutate rapidly, and they can establish something of a “genetic Internet” that enables certain pathogenic bacteria to “download” antibiotic-resistant genes.
考虑到这些集群的结构性优势 — — 包括接近大城市中心 — — 它们能够为面向印度的投资带来最佳回报。	Given their structural advantages – including proximity to large urban centers for some – these clusters could generate some of the best returns on investment anywhere in India.
读者们可以看到“储蓄过剩”论在近十年前开始大行其道，前美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘和本·伯南克都持有这一观点。	Readers will detect here echoes of the “savings glut” argument popularized nearly a decade ago by the likes of former US Federal Reserve Board Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.
根据冰川物质流失的整体速率和冰川面积来推算，面积最小的喜马拉雅山冰川在 1960~2004 年期间损失了高达 57% 的冰川物质，而这一部分冰川是数量最大的。	Applying the overall ratio of mass lost to area covered, this means that the smallest (and most numerous) Himalayan glaciers lost up to 57% of their mass between 1960 and 2004.
在乌干达，费福里特·雷吉纳（Favourite Regina）致力于将女童救出童婚和早孕。 她是CIYOTA组织领导的一项计划的一部分。	In Uganda, Favourite Regina is keeping refugee girls out of early marriage and pregnancy, as part of an initiative led by CIYOTA, a youth-led, volunteer-based organization established in the Kyangwali refugee settlement.
它能够说服受到恫吓的（往往是老年）选民。 按照英国脱欧派的说法，他们可以“控制”自己的生活和国家，而实现这一目标的主要方式是拒绝外国人。	It persuades intimidated (often elderly) voters that, in the parlance of the Brexiteers, they can “take back control” of their lives and their countries, primarily by rejecting foreigners.
在那样的形势下，沙龙会转而寻求反对派领导人，80岁高龄的前首相西蒙•佩雷斯的支持，组建国家团结政府。	Sharon will then turn to the leader of the opposition, 80-year-old former prime minister Shimon Peres, to form a national unity government.
但在欧洲大陆，许多核反应堆距离别国领土都不足100英里（161公里 ） ， 可见一场发生在欧洲的核事故极可能造成跨国界的影响。	In continental Europe, many reactors are within 100 miles (161 kilometers) of another country’s territory. So a nuclear accident in Europe would likely have cross-border consequences.
总会有那么一天，投资者不再相信英镑和美元资产会免受通胀影响，那时，他们持有低收益率英镑或美元资产的意愿就会消失。	A moment may come when foreign investors do not believe that their sterling or dollar assets are protected against inflation, and at that point their willingness to hold low-yield sterling and dollar assets will end.
如今，移民数量再次上升，原因在于中东和其他地区长期动乱，而欧洲邻国也变得日益动荡和危险（主要是因为俄罗斯的修正主义和军事扩张 ） 。	And now the number of immigrants is increasing again, reflecting chronic turmoil in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as Europe’s increasingly turbulent and dangerous neighborhood, largely owing to Russian revisionism and military expansion.
太大而不能倒的银行享受着比中等规模银行更低的债务利率，因为贷款人相信这些银行的债券和交易合同能够获得偿付，哪怕银行本身倒闭。	Too-big-to-fail banks enjoy lower interest rates on debt than their mid-size counterparts, because lenders know that the bonds or trading contracts that such banks issue will be paid, even if the bank itself fails.
在这种先有鸡还是先有蛋的困境中，仅靠市场无力破除外部性的制约，政府就可以扮演起一个关键性的推动者角色。	In such chicken-and-egg situations, in which the market alone fails to overcome externalities and essential investments go lacking, the government can play a vital facilitating role.
在未来25年中，全球经济规模可能会翻三倍，主要的增长动力来自发展中国家，它们将赶超发达国家的收入水平，并采用和发达国家相似的消费模式。	The global economy will probably triple in size in the next quarter-century, largely owing to growth in developing countries as they catch up to developed-country incomes and adopt similar consumption patterns.
但当某些前苏联加盟共和国着手销毁核武器之时，克里姆林宫却将核武器库 — — 这个俄罗斯前超级大国地位的最后一点遗产 — — 紧紧地抱在了怀里。	While elimination did take place in the former Soviet Republics, the Kremlin hung on to its nuclear arsenal – the last vestige of Russia’s former superpower status.
选择欧洲理事会主席需要长时间的讨价还价，最终的人选是波兰总理唐纳德·塔斯克（Donald Tusk ） 。	Selecting the president of the European Council required considerable time and horse-trading, with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk emerging as the final choice.
多年来，中国强制在华经营的美国公司向中国公司转让关键技术和知识产权，这让中国难以洗脱经济掠夺者的形象。	And after years of forcing US companies operating in China to transfer key technologies and intellectual property to Chinese firms, that reputation will be hard to shed.
事实上，对健康食品（包括无抗生素肉类）的需求的增加已迫使麦当劳、好事多（Costco）和肯德基等食品业巨头宣布逐步淘汰含抗生素肉类的计划。	Indeed, rising demand for healthier foods, including antibiotic-free meat, has already compelled major food-industry players like McDonald’s, Costco, and KFC to declare their intention to phase out antibiotic-laden meat.
此外中国面向互联性的狂飙还远未停止：在2011年中期，13亿中国人中只有36%能够上网 — — 这个数字相比韩国，日本和美国等地高达80%的渗透率来说还是偏低。	Moreover, China’s rush to connectivity is far from over. As of mid-2011, only 36% of its 1.3 billion people were connected – far short of the nearly 80% penetration rates seen in South Korea, Japan, and the United States.
欧洲各国政府还应改革其税收制度，让那些有长期稳定工作的劳动者缴纳更多，为雇佣弱势劳动者的公司提供财政激励，并推动建立全欧盟层面的贫困保险计划。	European governments should also overhaul their tax systems to make older workers contribute more, offer fiscal incentives to companies that hire disadvantaged workers, and move toward establishing an EU-wide poverty-insurance scheme.
这一方案包括开放加沙和西岸的道口，在加沙建立港口和机场，开放与埃及的边界以及把以色列定居者遗弃的温室转交给阿拉伯人。	It included opening crossings between Gaza and the West Bank, an airport and seaport in Gaza, opening the border with Egypt, and transferring the greenhouses abandoned by Israeli settlers into Arab hands.
法院的态度非常坚定：虽然目前只剩下为数不多的几次庭审，但除斯雷布雷尼察外法院尚未做出任何有关种族灭绝罪的判决。	The court has been consistent: with just a few trials left, it has issued no convictions for genocide apart from Srebrenica.
投资于改善住房，现代交通，通讯网络，工业中心和企业发展所需的政府税收体系需要得到强化，但目前来说也算是运行正常。	The revenue systems needed to invest in better housing, modern transport, communication networks, industrial hubs, and enterprise development require strengthening, but they are not dysfunctional.
有时领导人自以为远景可以解决他们所面临的大部分问题，但殊不知一个错误的 — — 或是一个野心过分膨胀的 — — 远景却会令他们深受其害。	Sometimes leaders think that vision can solve most of their problems, but the wrong vision – or an overly ambitious vision – can do damage.
尽管美联储的联邦基金利率已经上升至2 ％ ， 但欧洲央行已决定将利率维持在零，或者至少维持在利率曲线的短端。	The European Central Bank has decided to keep interest rates at zero, at least at the short end of the curve, even though the US Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate has already increased to 2%.
而2001年的波恩协定，2006年的伦敦协定以及2008年4月的北约布加勒斯特宣言都在政治，经济和社会方面为阿富汗设定了诸多目标 — — 而这些目标往往都与塔利班的价值观大相径庭。	The 2001 Bonn Agreement, the 2006 London Compact, and NATO’s April 2008 Bucharest Declaration also list a range of political, economic, and social objectives for Afghanistan that in many cases conflict with Taliban values.
巨额的偿付不仅仅耗尽了公帑；仅仅是存这一威胁，就让政府无法追求进取的气候政策，因为它们担心碳依赖行业在国际仲裁法庭上起诉它们。	Big payouts do more than drain public coffers; the mere threat of them discourages governments from pursuing more ambitious climate policies, owing to fear that carbon-dependent industries could challenge them in international tribunals.
比较优势显然会影响长期经济利益，但需求条件将决定中国或美国是否将在未来几个月内面临寻求贸易和平的更大压力。	Comparative advantage certainly influences long-term economic welfare, but demand conditions will determine whether China or America feels more pressure to sue for trade peace in the next few months.
除预料之中的明确限制外 — — 女性入伍可能还需要得到其法定男性监护人的许可，而且可能限于充当非战斗性角色 — — 此外还必须废除军队僵化的男权体制。	Beyond the explicit constraints that are expected – women will probably have to secure approval from their legal male guardians, and may be limited to non-combat roles – there is the need to dismantle the military’s rigid patriarchal systems.
如果脱欧最后演变成一个长达十年的过程，损失可以在此期间逐渐吸收，平均每年造成0.2—0.3%的GDP损失。	If the exit turns out to be a ten-year process, the losses would be borne gradually over that period, costing the UK about 0.2-0.3% of GDP per year, on average.
一个原因是前任日本银行行长白川方明（Masaaki Shirakawa）所实施的紧缩货币政策导致日本经济在15年的时间里都没能实现其增长潜力，直到黑田东彦（Haruhiko Kuroda）上任才有所改观。	One reason for this is the contractionary monetary policy pursued by former Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, which prevented the economy from reaching its growth potential for more than 15 years, until Haruhiko Kuroda took over the position.
比如说，虽然美国的房屋数量显然已经超出了其承受能力，但地产界国会游说团却不希望于政府支持房屋缩减计划。	For example, the real-estate lobby in the US obviously has no desire to see government support for housing diminish, despite the fact that the US probably has far more housing stock than it can afford.
但是一个更为根本的问题是为什么俄国的政坛人物、记者以及分析家们(而且甚至连西方的某些人)对这一策略乐此不疲。	But a more fundamental question is why Russia’s politicians, journalists, and analysts (and even some in the West) happily engage in this ruse.
虽然领导人并非直接或由代表机构选举产生，但他们的绩效却受到密切的关注 — — 例如，接受全国人民代表大会和地方人民代表大会的审议监督。	While leaders are not elected, either directly or by a representative body, their performance is subject to close scrutiny – for example, by the National People’s Congress (NPC) and local people’s congresses.
该小组的21名成员既包括了发达国家和发展中国家的首脑和财政部长，还涵盖了国际组织代表，公共财政和发展领域的专家，以及来自私人部门的领袖人物。	The 21-member group included heads of state and ministers from both developed and developing countries, representatives from international organizations, experts on public finance and development, and leaders from the private sector.
化石燃料游说集团、工业化国家不肯作为的政府，以及漠不关心的选民导致减少全球温室气体排放的强大协议障碍重重，迟迟无法形成。	Fossil-fuel lobbies, reluctant governments in industrialized countries, and disengaged electorates have delayed and obstructed the emergence of a robust agreement to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions.
伊朗充满恶意的仇犹言论通过将伊朗军事力量作为整个穆斯林世界与以色列对峙的先锋，显而易见是要欺骗受到惊吓的阿拉伯邻国。	Iran’s viciously anti-Semitic rhetoric is a transparent attempt to deceive its terrified Arab neighbors by presenting its military might as the spearhead of an all-Muslim confrontation with Israel.
如果全世界不能减缓未来气候变化的趋势，那么上升的气温、愈发严重的旱情、愈加频繁严重的热带��暴、不断上涨的海平线以及热带疾病的扩散将会给全球带来严峻考验。	If the world fails to mitigate future climate change, the effects of rising temperatures, increasing droughts, more numerous and severe tropical storms, rising sea levels, and a spread of tropical diseases will pose huge threats to the entire planet.
美国国务院法律顾问高洪柱不同意这种说法，并提出美国正在打一场世界范围内“与基地组织和塔利班及相关势力的武装战争 。 ”	US State Department legal adviser Harold Koh disagrees, arguing that America is involved in a worldwide “armed conflict with Al Qaeda, as well as the Taliban and associated forces.”
设想一下：2014年8月，世卫组织宣布西非埃博拉危机为国际关注的公共卫生紧急状况（PHEIC ） ； 后紧急状况于2016年3月被取消。	Consider this: in August 2014, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola crisis in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC); it lifted that status in March 2016.
特朗普非但没有通过世贸组织寻求多边解决方案，反而试图增加美国的钢铁产量，从而导致过剩状况进一步加剧。	Rather than pursuing a multilateral solution through the World Trade Organization, Trump is instead trying to increase US steel production, which will only add to the glut.
也许是因为瑞行注意到了先前危机的危害，而且那些打算使用这些信息对未来行动进行支持的当局不愿对此提出评论意见。	It may also be that notice has been taken of the precedent, and that those authorities that intend to use it to justify future moves are loathe to criticize it.
任何人，只要拥有一台笔记本电脑和互联网接入，就可以与虚拟朋友对话（或谈论虚拟朋友 ） ； 就可以见证可能发生也可能没有发生的重大事件；就可以在无比复杂的虚拟世界中玩游戏。	Anyone with a laptop and an Internet connection can gossip with (or about) virtual friends; witness extraordinary events that may or may not have happened; or play games in a mock world of incomparable complexity.
然而时至今日，根据拉美研究学者迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen）的研究判断 ， “ 阿根廷社会的大多数人都是贝隆主义者 … … 贝隆创造了一个目前中产阶级享受的福利国家 。 ”	Yet today, according to the Latin America scholar Michael Cohen, “most of Argentine society is Perónist….Perón delivered a welfare state from which the current middle class benefits.”
很难想象欧洲各国的政策差异能在领袖们自我下达的期限内 — — 他们宣称“到下次峰会召开时就能解决 ” — —得到弥合。	It is hard to imagine how Europe’s policy differences can be overcome by the leaders’ self-imposed March deadline, when the next summit will take place.
阿纳苏亚姨妈一直坚持收留那些无家可归的学生和经济拮据的单身母亲，或者仅仅是在自己的餐桌上为那些父母无暇照料的年轻人留双碗筷。	She is continually taking in students who need a home, or refugee single mothers in economic need, or simply making one more place at the table for teenagers whose parents are struggling with issues of their own.
IMF一直是开发各国可用于测量、评估和改善当前宏观经济状况的工具的重镇，包括财政和货币政策以及金融、货币和物价稳定。	The IMF has been instrumental in developing the tools with which countries measure, assess, and improve their current macroeconomic position: fiscal and monetary policy, as well as financial, currency, and price stability.
圣地亚哥 — — 根据美国国会预算办公室发布的数据，唐纳德·特朗普的医保法案 — — 也因为以众议院议长保罗·瑞安的名字命名而被亲切地称为“瑞安医保法案 “ — —如获通过，2，400万美国人拥有健康保险的权利将被剥夺。	SANTIAGO – Donald Trump’s health-care bill – nicknamed “Ryancare,” after House Speaker Paul Ryan – would have deprived 24 million Americans of health insurance, according to the US Congressional Budget Office.
诚然，信贷繁荣本身可能源于围绕着经济增长潜力所产生的过度乐观 — — 这是受全球化和新科技影响的结果。	Granted, the credit boom itself may be rooted in excessive optimism surrounding the economic-growth potential implied by globalization and new technologies.
当这场危机变成数百万人失业 — — 特别是那些找不到工作、眼看将沦为失落的一代的欧洲年轻人 — — 的悲惨现实时，欧盟机构也沦为了千夫所指的对象。	Once the crisis became a sad daily reality for millions of unemployed – particularly for what appears to be a lost generation of young, jobless Europeans – EU institutions also became a target of popular rage.
相反，奥萨马·本·拉登视为暴虐的罗宾汉很具诱惑力，其行为虽然不可饶恕，却帮助他们赢得了阿拉伯人的自豪感和尊严。	Instead, there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Hood, whose actions, while impossible to condone officially, have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity.
技术其实是三种知识形式：体现在工具和材料中的知识；写成秘方、协议和说明书的知识；以及大脑中不可言传的知识或技能。	Technology is really three forms of knowledge: embodied knowledge in tools and materials, codified knowledge in recipes, protocols, and how-to manuals, and tacit knowledge or knowhow in brains.
近几年不断下滑的利率推高了不动产价格，从而让美国的中上阶层能够将自己的房产当作巨型的“自动提款机 ” ， 并使储蓄率进一步降低。	Falling interest rates in recent years pushed up real estate prices and allowed America’s upper middle class to treat their houses as enormous ATM’s, lowering savings still more.
在世贸组织成立的推动下，双边和区域贸易及投资协定迅速扩展及中国的崛起导致1990年代和2000年代全球贸易爆发，而非大幅滑落。	Instead of heading south, global trade exploded in the 1990s and 2000s, driven by the creation of the World Trade Organization, the proliferation of bilateral and regional trade and investment agreements, and the rise of China.
但是，就像欧洲明白仅仅依靠紧缩政策是无法解决问题一样，美国采取这种手段的可能性是比较小的。 相反，紧缩政策仅仅会加剧经济衰退。	But this is as unlikely as it is that Europe will figure out that austerity alone will not solve its problems. On the contrary, austerity will only exacerbate the economic slowdown.
这种转变的主要驱动力是中国。 过去五年来，中国一直在通过在南中国海建造人工岛礁来将其边界向国际水域推进。	The main driver of this shift has been China, which over the last five years has been working to push its borders far out into international waters, by building artificial islands in the South China Sea.
罗马—在过去几年中，许多人和他们的领导人都认为全球化已经成为一个祸害，必须通过加强保护主义和单边主义来清理。	ROME – In the last few years, for many people and their leaders, globalization has become a scourge to be purged in favor of greater protectionism and unilateralism.
在B·H·里德尔·哈特反思一战经验的经典论述战略：间接方法中，哈特坚持认为直接进攻在防御工事中的敌人是匹夫之勇。	In his classic treatise Strategy: The Indirect Approach, B.H. Liddell Hart, reflecting on his World War I experiences, insisted on the foolhardiness of direct attacks on an entrenched enemy.
尽管一些脱欧派 — — 包括最著名的前伦敦市长约翰逊（Boris Johnson ） — —已经入职政府，但领衔头欧阵营的人中没有一位最终为脱欧负责。	Though some of the Brexiteers – most notably former London Mayor Boris Johnson – are now in the government, none of those who led the campaign to leave the European Union are ultimately responsible for carrying it out.
亚洲富于变化和活力，但相对欧洲而言，其政治、经济和安全机构的影响都比较薄弱；亚洲机构往往缺乏活力，而且复杂繁琐。	Asia is rich in dynamism, but relatively thin in influential political, economic, and security-related institutions, in contrast to Europe, which often lacks dynamism but is institution-heavy.
把宝押在气候工程上 — — 不论是作为地球保险政策，还是作为遏制气温升高的孤注一掷 — — 不但风险很大，还有可能让人们的注意力从我们所知的唯一能够起作用的方案 — — 减少碳排放上转移。	Betting on climate engineering – either as a planetary insurance policy or as a last-ditch measure to combat rising temperatures – is not only risky; it also directs attention away from the only solution we know will work: reducing carbon emissions.
首先，这些经济体在太长的时间里沉溺于开放国际贸易、吸引外国直接投资、价格自由化以及实现宏观经济稳定。	First, for too long, these economies have been obsessed with opening to international trade, attracting foreign direct investment, liberalizing prices, and achieving macroeconomic stabilization.
此外，托宾税能让金融交易者 — — 大多是有着良好工作习惯的人才 — — 转行 ， （ 决策者希望）这能够让经济获得更多的好处。	Moreover, a Tobin tax moves financial traders – talented people with strong work habits – into other activities, which (policymakers hope) will benefit the economy more.
《自然》的研究指出 ： “ 北极圈资源的开发和任何非常规石油产量的增加不利于将全球平均升温水平限制在２℃以内的目标 。 ”	As the Nature study puts it: “Development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2º C.”
认识不足部分原因在于女性将在线经历大事化小、小事化了的方式；许多人担心说出经历多少回对职业地位造成负面影响。	The lack of awareness is partly due to the way women minimize their online experiences; many worry that speaking out will somehow negatively affect their job status.
但这种期望对于奥巴马也是一个难题，因为他想要满足人们的期望的话，将是不容易的-在某些情况下也是不可能的。	But this anticipation is also a problem for Obama, as it will be difficult – and in some instances impossible – for him to meet expectations.
4月3日特朗普政府宣布打算对价值500亿美元的中国出口产品额外加征关税，以回应对方的工业间谍活动，许可证及其他知识产权问题。	On April 3, the Trump administration announced its intention to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese exports, in response to industrial espionage, licensing, and other intellectual-property concerns.
事实上，过去一百年中我们只经历了三场突出的全球危机：1929—1933年、1980—1982年，以及2007—2009年。	In fact, we have had only three salient global crises in the last century: 1929-33, 1980-82, and 2007-9.
通过研究不同大目标和小目标如何彼此关联起来，我们开发了一个独立研究框架帮助领导人在各自国家制定优先政策。	By studying how different goals and targets relate to one another, we developed an independent analytical framework to help leaders prioritize policies within their own countries.
最严重的结构性缺陷在于高工资税和劳动力市场管制，这使得企业难以在商业景气度恶化时裁员（或者说裁员的成本太高 ） 。	The most serious structural flaws concern high payroll taxes and labor-market regulation, which make it difficult – or at least prohibitively expensive – for firms to reduce their workforce when business conditions worsen.
对穆尔西及其支持者来说，中立宪法法院法官是必要的，他们在去年6月的判决解散了革命后首个自由选举选出的国民大会（议会下院 ） 。	For Morsi and his supporters, it was imperative to neutralize the Constitutional Court judges, whose ruling last June dissolved the first freely elected, post-revolution People’s Assembly (the parliament’s lower house).
此外，非洲和亚洲的金融技术公司正在寻找创新方式来分析贫困人口活动所产生的数据，并利用相关数据来设计和提供更高质量的银行服务。	Moreover, financial technology firms in Africa and Asia are finding innovative ways to analyze data generated by poor people’s activities, and using that data to design and deliver better banking services.
根据来自“解脱行动 ” （ 一个代表关塔那摩在押人员的英国组织）的调查员考特尼·布斯克的报道，精神治疗病房内有24小时监控录像，并安排了一名警卫进行不间断监视。	According to Cortney Busch of Reprieve, a British organization that represents Guantánamo detainees, there is video running on prisoners in the psychiatric ward at all times, and there is a guard posted there continually, too.
农业，主要是自给自足型农业，养活了非洲 超过60%的劳动人口，造成对谋生手段的广泛破坏，更不要说因为作物被破坏影响了粮食安全。	Agriculture, predominantly subsistence farming, employs over 60% of the African workforce, implying widespread destruction of livelihoods, to say nothing of increased food insecurity as crops are disrupted.
出于这一感觉，特朗普将历史学家理查德·霍夫斯塔特（Richard Hofstadter）所描述的“偏执逛风格”从美国政坛的边缘带到了主流。	In this sense, Trump has taken what the historian Richard Hofstadter described as the “paranoid style” from the fringes of US politics into the mainstream.
这次选举和以前的选举一样，选票是投到印度发明的电子投票机中的，这种投票机具有简单、可靠和耐用的优点。	In this election, as in previous ones, votes will be cast on electronic voting machines invented in India, which combine the virtues of simplicity, reliability, and ruggedness.
发自米兰 — — 在最近一系列研究中，卡门·莱恩哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）使用了大量历史数据来表明处于高位的公共（及私人）债务/GDP累积对经济增长存在着长期的负面影响。	MILAN – In a recent set of studies, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff used a vast array of historical data to show that the accumulation of high levels of public (and private) debt relative to GDP has an extended negative effect on growth.
因为他们并没有将专制主义视为实现神权民主制的障碍并反对之，而是试图说服专制主义的代表，最高领袖阿亚图拉·阿里·哈梅内伊，希望他能明白改革的价值所在。	Far from opposing absolutist power as an impediment to religious democracy, they tried to persuade the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, of the value of reform.
我领导的哥本哈根共识中心最近委托60组经济学家评估上述目标的成本效益状况。 上述拟议中的目标将取代千年发展目标于9月生效。	The Copenhagen Consensus Center, of which I am director, recently asked 60 teams of economists to evaluate the benefits and costs of these proposed targets, which will come into force to replace the Millennium Development Goals in September.
而即使进行新大选，结果也不会有多少不同，除非SPD领导人马丁·舒尔茨（Martin Schulz）下台。	And even if there is a new election, the outcome would not be much different, unless SPD leader Martin Schulz steps down.
1956年匈牙利革命领导人纳吉以及杜布切克成为各自国家的象征，这就否定了那种共产主义完全就是外国强加之物的说法。	Imre Nagy, the leader of the Hungarian revolt in 1956, and Dubcek became parts of their national legends, which belies the claim that communism was exclusively a foreign imposition.
为了在不要求每笔交易都实现资金收付的情况下促进贸易，欧洲经济合作组织在1950年成立了欧洲支付同盟（EPU ） 。	To facilitate trade without requiring payment after each transaction, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation created the European Payments Union in 1950.
对于这个半个世纪以来一直处于政府枷锁之下的机构来说这堪称一项标志性事件，象征着对中央银行独立性的要求已经成为了常识。	This was a landmark event for an institution that had been under the yoke of government for a half-century. It symbolized how the need for central bank independence had become conventional wisdom.
更糟糕的是，特朗普一直坚称与朝鲜的后续谈判“进展良好 ” ， 哪怕美国国务卿蓬佩奥最近的平壤之旅只带回了互相谴责。	Making matters worse, Trump has continued to insist that follow-up talks with the North are “going well,” even though US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s last visit to Pyongyang ended with a round of mutual recrimination.
所有人都明白这个词的意义：魏玛俄国，和魏玛德国一样，表示一个软弱无力的共和国遭到那些渴望恢复独裁主义的民族主义分子的内部进攻。	The meaning was clear to all: Weimar Russia, like Weimar Germany, signified a weak republic attacked from within by nationalists yearning to restore authoritarian ways.
确实，对整个经济领域的间歇性高估 — — 回想一下十年前的互联网泡沫 — — 表明金融市场经常会过分关注长期利益。	Indeed, the intermittent over-valuation of entire economic sectors – recall the dot-com bubble from a decade ago – indicates that financial markets are often excessively focused on the long term.
被水覆盖的湿地尤其如此，不论是季节性湿地还是永久性湿地 — — 湿地包括了所有陆地地区 — — 比如湖泊、泛洪区、泥炭地、红树林和珊瑚礁等。	This is particularly true of wetlands, which include all land areas – such as lakes, floodplains, peatlands, mangroves, and coral reefs – that are covered with water, either seasonally or permanently.
（在1988年公民投票中）击败皮诺切特（并在1989年大选中击败其总统候选人）的中左翼联盟十分明智，他们坚持并在某些情况下深化了从军政府那里承袭下来的有效的自由市场政策。	The center-left coalition that defeated Pinochet (in a 1988 plebiscite and his presidential candidate in the 1989 election) has been wise enough to keep, and in some cases deepen, the sound free-market policies inherited from the military government.
青年人的这种摇摆不定，漫不经心，不负责任的特征都能典型美国男人身上看到，而当他们拥有在全球范围内使用暴力的能力时，这种特征使他们变得令人十分担心。	That whiff of careening, heedless adolescent fecklessness is part of what makes the archetypal American male presence alarming when he is equipped with a global cudgel.
毕竟，据报他根本无法吸收全面、有组织的政策简报，而他的意见总是与最后一位与他交谈者的意见有许多相似之处。	After all, he is reportedly unable to absorb comprehensive, organized policy briefings, and his opinions tend to reflect those of whomever he spoke to last.
他信是泰国的商界首富。 他信被控腐败以及通过将家族家族企业那越集团以19亿美元免税出售给新加坡政府控股的淡马锡控股公司的叛国行径。	They accuse Thaksin, Thailand’s wealthiest businessman, of corruption and treason for the tax-free sale of his family-owned Shin Corporation to the Singapore government’s Temasek Holdings for $1.9 billion.
在美国，这一压力是特朗普当选的推动力之一（尽管人们常常错误地将就业问题归咎于移民和包括中国在内的发展中国家的出口 ） 。	In the US, that pressure was a driving force behind Trump’s election (though it was often and disproportionately blamed on immigrants and developing-country exporters, including China).
但贸易谈判不是讨论经常项目失衡的原因和结果、达成关于宏观经济政策协调的一致的正确场合；IMF和G-20才是。	But trade negotiations are not the right forum for discussing the causes and consequences of current-account imbalances and reaching agreements on macroeconomic-policy coordination; that is what the IMF and the G-20 are for.
amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 它们知道，即使是轻声谈论这一可能性也将会引发投资者恐慌。	They understand that even whispering about that possibility would panic investors.
一种推动进步，特别是农业部门进步的方法是取消或重新定位鼓励在粮食生产过程中过度使用肥料、水或能源的补贴。	One way to get things moving, especially in the agricultural sector, would be to remove or redirect subsidies that encourage excessive consumption of fertilizers, water, or energy in food production.
每次有人使用我提出的信息不对称理论，都会令我感到由衷的高兴¾虽然如果他们提及我的名字，会使我感到更加高兴。	I am pleased when someone uses my ideas on asymmetric information – though I do appreciate them giving me some credit.
作为非洲高人口生产率的结果，联合国人口司预计2050年非洲的人口数量将在目前9亿的基础上翻一番，达到18亿。	As a result of high fertility rates in Africa, the UN Population Division predicts a doubling of Africa's population from around 900 million today to around 1.8 billion in 2050.
根据政治学家萨拉·宾德（Sarah Binder）的看法，自十九世纪末以来，美国两大政党的意识形态分歧从未向现在那么大。	According to the political scientist Sarah Binder, the ideological divide between America’s two main political parties has not been as large as it is now since the end of the nineteenth century.
同样重要的是，研究者必须更好地去解释科学“确定性”意味着什么，帮助公众和决策者区分已证实的假设和未证实的理论。	Equally important, researchers must do a better job explaining what scientific “certainty” means, helping the public and policymakers to distinguish between proven hypotheses and unverified theories.
二十世纪九十年代的巴尔干战争后，近东和中东地区立即成为当今欧盟最为危险、并且鉴于安全考虑，也是最为重要的近邻。	After the Balkan Wars of the 1990’s, the Near and Middle East is at once the most dangerous and also – given security considerations – the most important neighboring region for the EU today.
如果教育投资回报继续下降，那么维持学生贷款将挤出其他消费和投资项，特别是在学生贷款拥有很高的资本结构地位的情况下。	If the return on investment in education continues to decline, the servicing of student loans will tend to crowd out other consumption and investment outlays, especially given that student debt has considerable seniority in the capital structure.
特朗普与台湾套近乎、子虚乌有地攻击中国、废除TPP，这样的做法既是在挑衅中国，同时也在加强中国的实力和能力。	By moving closer to Taiwan, attacking China on phantom grounds, and dismantling the TPP, Trump is provoking China while simultaneously empowering and enabling it.
总而言之，这三大发展趋势有助于解释新选民阶层的兴起：高技能、高薪酬，没有受过作为自由民主基础的价值观的教育。	Taken together, these three developments help to explain the rise of a new class of voters: highly skilled, highly paid, and poorly educated in the values underpinning liberal democracy.
在共和及民主两党的竞选活动中，主要问题在于候选人能否让足够数量的支持者参加预选 — — 即在寒冷冬夜举行的相对小规模的聚会活动。	The main question, in both the Republican and Democratic races, is whether the candidates can get enough of their supporters to the caucuses – relatively small gatherings held in the evening in wintry conditions.
从将自己定义为反殖民主义者和反种族主义者—多元文化主义的领军派—他们转变成为针对穆斯林正统派的所谓启蒙价值观的竭力捍卫者。	From defining themselves as anti-colonialists and anti-racists – champions of multiculturalism amp#45;amp#45; they have become fervent defenders of so-called Enlightenment values against Muslim orthodoxy.
因此，几乎肯定地说，假设6月与伊朗达成最终协议，欧洲对该协议的支持将是一边倒的，并且欧洲很希望支持奥巴马在国内就该协议与反对者所展开的斗争。	Thus, it is nearly certain that, assuming a final agreement with Iran is reached in June, Europe’s backing for it will be unanimous – or close to it – and that it will be eager to support Obama in his battle with opponents of the deal at home.
大会的讨论主要集中于如何在价格、可获得性和各学区设施（决定了该学区可以准备和提供何种食物）约束条件下采购、准备和运送食物。	The discussion focused mainly on how food can be procured, prepared, and delivered within the constraints of pricing, availability, and each school district’s facilities (which determine what kind of food they can prepare and serve).
而尽管IMF反对，不少著名经济学家 — — 包括克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman ） — —都支持资本管制。	And even as the Fund opposed them, prominent economists – among them Paul Krugman – endorsed their use.
之后，在2016年，俄罗斯军事情报部门进一步黑进民主党全国委员会的专用网络盗取信息，并将所盗取的信息在线发布以破坏希拉里·克林顿竞选总统。	Then, in 2016, Russian military intelligence went a step further, by hacking into the private network of the Democratic National Committee, stealing information, and releasing it online to damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy.
作为学生必修课参与其中不仅会提高维基百科全书业已令人惊叹的集体知识基础，而且还有可能帮助限制在全球知识体系中研究人员的精英外表。	Compulsory student participation would not only improve Wikipedia ’s already impressive collective knowledge base, but also might help curb the elitist pretensions of researchers in the global knowledge system.
奥巴马毫不理会那些欧洲盟友和手下那些支持武装介入叙利亚事务的安全顾问们(包括前国务卿希拉里)的呼声，而是直白地陈述了他对这一动乱地区的宿命式结论。	Cynically dismissive of both his European allies and his security advisers, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who supported military intervention in Syria, Obama minces no words in his fatalistic depiction of the troubled region.
欧洲愿意将欧洲金融稳定基金（EFSF）用于各种想象得到的新用途 — — 比如用于股权投资或作为第一损失保险。	A glimmer of hope is Europe’s willingness to use the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) imaginatively – as equity or first-loss cover.
加里·科恩（Gary Cohn）仍然是国家经济委员会主席，尽管据说他对总统在一些非经济问题上的言论感到不快。	Gary Cohn continues to chair the National Economic Council, though he is reported to be unhappy about some of the president’s statements on non-economic issues.
面对当下的经济危机，采取“混”下去的方式将使危机继续，经济长期停滞不前。 这正是凯恩斯同时代的经济学家埃尔文·汉森所描述的情况。	In today’s crisis, muddling through would be a recipe for a continuation of the crisis and secular stagnation of the type once described by Alvin Hansen, a contemporary of Keynes.
眼前所见的一切令我不禁回想起20年前的波兰，当时波兰首届自由选举刚刚落幕，并与在6个月后倒塌的柏林墙一道成为宣告冷战结束的标志性事件	What I saw reminded me of my country 20 years ago, just after Poland’s first free elections, which, together with the fall of the Berlin Wall barely six months later, came to symbolize the Cold War’s end.
不过，话说回来，我也不会相信几年、甚或几个月前，美国共和党会在唐纳德·特朗普和特德·克鲁兹之间选择总统候选人。	But, then again, I wouldn’t have believed a few years ago, or even a few months ago, that the Republican Party in the United States would be choosing between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz as its presidential nominee.
但其力度与美联储不可同日而语，既没有将利率降至近零水平，也没有推出量化宽松，而只是对政策利率（2008年下半年降了五次）和准备金要求（降了四次）做了常规下调。	But such efforts fell well short of those of the Fed, with no zero-interest-rate or quantitative-easing gambits – only standard reductions in policy rates (five cuts in late 2008) and reserve requirements (four adjustments).
在其它国家，特别是前苏联的加盟共和国和拉美国家，大权在握的人干脆按自己的意愿修改宪法¾其中就包括限制任期的规定。	Elsewhere, notably in many of the Soviet Union’s other successor states and in Latin America, those in power have often simply changed the constitution – including rules on term limits – to their advantage.
政府必须强调自身的监管和执法职能，包括制定及监督标准，建立有效的产权基础设施及管理宏观经济环境，而不是直接拉动投资。	Rather than directly driving investment, the state must emphasize its regulatory and enforcement functions, including setting and overseeing standards, building an effective property-rights infrastructure, and managing macroeconomic conditions.
为了在欧洲央行推行多样化和性别平等，2012年欧洲议会否决了任命卢森堡的摩尔什（Yves Mersch）为执行委员会委员的任命。	In an effort to promote diversity and gender equality in the ECB, the European Parliament in 2012 blocked the appointment of Luxembourg’s Yves Mersch to the bank’s executive board.
如果有人觉得欧元不会在未来5~10年内面临进一步的实际压力测试（而不是更快爆发 ） ， 那就是太过幼稚了。	It is astonishingly naive to think the euro will not face further real-life stress tests over the next 5-10 years, if not sooner.
自10月份掌权以来，雅罗斯瓦夫·卡钦斯基的法律与正义党（PiS）已经攻击了波兰宪法法院，将司法和行政部门政治化，并打击媒体多元主义。	Since coming to power in October, Jarosław Kaczyński’s Law and Justice party (PiS) has attacked the country’s Constitutional Court, politicized the judiciary and the civil service, and launched an assault on media pluralism.
仅仅在不久之前，因为国际货币基金组织既没能现代化其以欧洲为中心的政治架构，也没能现代化其神秘的政府对政府的借贷工具，它似乎在较长的一段时间内变得和当前的金融危机毫不相干。	Just a short time ago, the IMF seemed relegated to a sustained period of irrelevance as it failed to modernize either its euro-centric political representation or its arcane government-to-government lending facilities.
以色列人和巴勒斯坦人正在打一场低级别的战争；伊拉克的局势正在改善，但谁也不能做任何保证；奥巴马可能要在攻击伊朗核设施和容忍能在几周内制造出核武器的伊朗这两者之间作出选择；阿富汗政府正在失去与死灰复燃的塔利班斗争的优势；拥有几十枚核武器的巴基斯坦，是世界上最危险的恐怖分子的基地，巴基斯坦可能会成为一个失败的国家，而拥有核武器的北韩情况也一样。	Obama may have to choose between attacking Iran’s nuclear installations and living with an Iran that has the capacity to build a nuclear weapon in a matter of weeks. Afghanistan’s government is losing ground in its struggle against a revived Taliban.
其次，欧洲需要将欧洲稳定机制这个救助基金雏形转变为真正的欧洲货币基金 (European Monetary Fund ) 。	Next, Europe needs to transform the European Stability Mechanism, its proto-rescue fund, into a true European Monetary Fund (EMF).
他认为这将改善美国贸易失衡，但他不理解，如果将外国出口从美国市场中消除，它们将没有美元购买美国商品。	He thinks this will improve the US trade balance, but does not understand that if foreign exporters are cut off from the US market, they will not have the dollars to buy US goods.
即便如此，虽然中国将放弃其汇率管制以提升货币自主性的预测在过去十年内都被证伪，但这此情况可能有所不同。	Nonetheless, though predictions that China would abandon its exchange-rate controls in order to uphold monetary autonomy have proved wrong over the last decade, this time may be different.
如今，中国可能还需要类似的激励来应对当前的挑战：即解决由不完美官僚体系监管的不完美但却快速扩张的市场所造成的新问题。	A similar approach could work today, as China’s leaders attempt to address the problems generated by the rapid expansion of imperfect markets managed by an imperfect bureaucracy.
对精英的信任缺失在某种程度上并非坏事，但大量民调显示，精英的信誉正在快速降低，而这显然增加了公民对授权给他们领导应对不确定的全球经济环境的抵制。	Lack of trust in elites is probably healthy at some level, but numerous polls indicate that it is in rapid decline, which surely increases citizens’ reluctance to delegate authority to navigate an uncertain global economic environment.
特朗普显得对衡量经常项目平衡的有关经济概念一无所知，知道今天，他一直在说“德国人是坏人，大坏人 ， ” 因为“他们卖给美国数百万辆车 。 ”	Trump, displaying his lack of understanding of the economic concepts involved in measuring current-account balances – went so far as to say that “the Germans are bad, very bad,” because of “the millions of cars they are selling to the US.”
例如，气候变化对地球造成了严重的威胁，这种威胁必须以普遍接受的科学标准和不断发展的天气科学的能力来进行评估。	Climate change, for example, poses dire threats to the planet that must be assessed according to prevailing scientific norms and the evolving capacity of climate science.
因此，从有效征税的角度看，在2011—2012年降低工资税并增加（医保方面的）税率结构的累进性是错误的。	Therefore, cutting the payroll tax rate in 2011-2012 and making the rate schedule more graduated (on the Medicare side) were mistakes from the standpoint of efficient taxation.
不久前北京的中国分析家告诉我他们认为日本正走向右翼军国民族主义，而购岛行为则是蓄意破坏二战后和解协议的企图。	In Beijing recently, Chinese analysts told me that they believe that Japan is entering a period of right-wing militaristic nationalism, and that purchasing the islands was a deliberate effort to begin eroding the post-WWII settlement.
今年的实力变迁与其说是拜俄罗斯的修正主义野心或中国的军事和经济崛起所赐，不如说是因为美国国际领导力的衰落。	These power shifts are the result less of Russia’s expansionist ambitions or China’s military and economic rise than of America’s declining international leadership.
所以当它们购买长期政府债券时就类似一家大型企业的子公司去购买母公司债务一样（等于母公司向自身发行了短期债 ） 。	So when they purchase long-term government bonds, they are acting like a subsidiary of a large corporation buying the debt of its parent company (issuing short-term liabilities to itself).
但是，在现在这种情况下，政府不一定要保释贝尔斯登 、美国国际集团或任何其他金融机构的债权人，这些机构将受益于保尔森的计划。	But in this case, the government does not have to bail out the debt-holders of Bear Sterns, AIG, or any of the other financial institutions that will benefit from Paulson’s plan.
奥地利、加拿大、菲律宾、莱索托和乌拉圭无法与世界增长冠军相媲美，因为它们没有过度借贷来维持重商主义经济模式。	Countries like Austria, Canada, the Philippines, Lesotho, and Uruguay cannot match the world’s growth champions, because they do not over-borrow or sustain a mercantilist economic model.
比方说，沃尔特·史蒂夫和约翰·米尔斯海默在其臭名昭著的论文“以色列游说势力”中断言该委员会是伊拉克战争的始作俑者。	For example, Steve Walt and John Mearsheimer, in their notorious essay “The Israel Lobby,” asserted that AIPAC manufactured the Iraq War.
本月的欧盟理事会将通过解决三个主要问题为CSDP的进一步发展打��基础：运转效率、防务能力和欧洲防务行业的状况。	This month’s Council will lay the foundations for the CSDP’s further development by addressing three main topics: operational efficiency, defense capabilities, and the state of the European defense industry.
以色列人和巴勒斯坦人之间就难民问题解决方案达成协议可以消除以色列的无端恐惧。 它担心巴勒斯坦人的回归权会对以色列的人口结构造成威胁。	The fact that Israelis and Palestinians need to agree on a solution of the refugee issue neutralizes unwarranted Israeli fears about the demographic threat posed by the Palestinians’ right of return.
由此造成的上述国家和整个穆斯林世界的不满在欧洲能够越来越明显地被感受到 — — 而且现在正在传播到美国。	The resulting discontent in those countries and across the Muslim world has increasingly been felt in Europe – and now is emerging in the US, too.
大烟草、大石油、大食品、大制药公司试过通过威逼利诱蚕食我们的公共国际空间，它们的目标都是一样的：消除妨碍日常生意的监管。	Big Tobacco, Big Oil, Big Food, and Big Pharma have tried to bully, buy, and bribe their way into our public international spaces, all with the same goal in mind: to fend off regulation that would disrupt business as usual.
更重要的是，当存在闲置资源时（比如，当失业率远远高于正常水平时 ） ， 来自政府借贷的支出能让这些资源获得使用。	More important, when there are idle resources (for example, when unemployment is much higher than normal), the spending that results from the government’s borrowing brings these resources into use.
此外，鉴于现有制度的合法性和延续快速经济增长之间的紧密关系，欧洲经济的萎靡不振甚至威胁到上述很多国家、特别是中国的政治稳定。	Moreover, Europe’s malaise threatens many of these countries’ political stability as well, given the close connection – especially in China – between the legitimacy of existing arrangements and the continuation of rapid economic growth.
交易者可能停止交易，但股东并不能更好地把握长期基本面分析：指数基金的大热（持有一揽子充分多样化、覆盖整个股票市场的指数）便反映了这一不利于股东的趋势。	Traders might stop trading, but shareholders still might not conduct more fundamental, long-term analysis: the rise of index funds, which hold a broadly-diversified swath of the entire stock market, reflects this trend toward stockholder passivity.
在由发展经济学家丹尼·罗德瑞克研究的框架中，在“可能进行突破性的〔政策〕改革”的地方，缺乏资本可以成为一个有效的“增长制约 ” 。	In the framework developed by the development economist Dani Rodrik, a shortage of capital can be a binding “growth constraint”: the place where “the biggest bang for the [policy] reform buck can be obtained.”
乔治敦大学教授夏米拉斯（Hector Schamis）最近回忆说，葡萄牙的萨拉扎（António de Oliveira Salazar ） 、 巴拉圭的斯特罗斯纳（Alfredo Stroessner）和印尼的苏哈托都是通过选举掌握权力的，但没有哪本历史书会说他们是民主的。	As Georgetown professor Hector Schamis recently recalled, António de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, and Suharto in Indonesia attained power through elections, yet no history book calls them democratic.
同样，一些依然不愿忘怀塞尔维亚人和希腊人在1913年巴尔干战争中的所作所为（当时保加利亚是战败国）的保加利亚人则认为马其顿人只不过是一群错误地站在了对立面的倔头倔脑的保加利亚人。	Similarly, some Bulgarians, still wounded by the Serb and Greek victories over their country in the Balkan War of 1913, regarded the Macedonians as nothing more than wayward Bulgarians trapped on the wrong side of the conflict.
但这并不意味着质疑特朗普的人可以高枕无忧地坐等他的错误坐实，因为有可能在第一年里，报告贸易赤字将有所收窄，尽管真实贸易赤字有所扩大。	But that doesn’t mean that Trump skeptics can just sit back and wait for him to be proven wrong, because it is possible that, in the first year, the reported trade deficit will narrow, even as the true trade deficit widens.
马克斯·莫斯利承认参加了这一活动（这并不违法 ） ， 但是起诉《世界新闻》侵犯了其隐私；报纸声称曝光莫斯利的性行为符合“公共利益 ” 。	Max Mosley admitted participating in this (not illegal) happening, but sued the News of the World for breach of privacy; the newspaper argued that it was in the “public interest” that Mosley’s sexual activities be disclosed.
南非私人保安业因工作环境恶劣而屡遭批评；即使抛开工作环境问题不谈，上述就业岗位也无法让人掌握足以支撑稳定及可持续经济增长所需要的技术。	The industry has faced criticism for poor working conditions; even where that is not the case, it does not develop the types of skills that can support stable and sustainable economic growth.
在1895年9月的连续十天里，有500多个伦敦人死于霍乱，Snow用城市地图将所有发生霍乱病例的家庭的位置标注出来。	During a ten-day period in September 1854, during which more than 500 Londoners died from the disease, Snow used a city map to mark the location of each household with a case of cholera.
去年俄罗斯的GDP增长率为1.5 ％ ， 而欧元区为2.5 ％ ， 美国为2.3 ％ （ 照理说这两个发达经济体的增长速度应该比俄罗斯这样的发展中经济体慢2~3个百分点 ） 。	Last year, Russia’s GDP-growth rate was 1.5%, compared to 2.5% in the eurozone and 2.3% in the United States – both developed economies that should be growing 2-3 percentage points slower than a developing economy like Russia.
相比之下，国家转型计划的实施将意味着与时间赛跑，需要顶住低油价、全球经济疲软和全球化后退等来自外部的压力。	The implementation of the NTP, by contrast, will be a race against time and a fight against the external headwinds of low oil prices, a weaker global economy, and retreat from globalization.
但他的耶路撒冷决定迫使沙特面临一个困境：是以捍卫巴勒斯坦人的事业为重，还是以实现对以关系正常化以遏制伊朗为重。	And yet his decision on Jerusalem forces the Saudis to confront a dilemma: whether to place a higher priority on defending the Palestinian cause, or on normalizing ties with Israel as a means to contain Iran.
因此除非罗姆人受到良好的教育并被社会所接纳 — — 这与今天的现实情况形成了鲜明的对比 — — 否则这些国家的经济前景只能是一片暗淡。	Unless the Roma are well educated and socially integrated – in stark contrast to today’s reality – these countries’ economic future is bleak.
而国内宏观经济学家的看法却恰恰相反，他们认为美元即将贬值非但不是一次危机，还是一次加速成长的难得机会。	Domestically oriented macroeconomists, by contrast, see a forthcoming fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis, but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.
全球新兴市场经济体情况要好一些，但是，尽管它们潜在产出的基本趋势增长率比发达经济体高得多，却仍然不可能做到周期性脱钩。	The world’s emerging-market economies are in better shape; but, while their underlying trend growth in potential output is much higher than that of the advanced economies, there is no cyclical de-coupling.
咨询公司麦肯锡在最新报告中指出，未来20年，印度需要投资至少1.2万亿美元或每年每人134美元于其城市基础设施。	The consultancy McKinsey argues in a recent report that India needs to invest at least $1.2 trillion in its urban infrastructure over the next two decades, or $134 per capita annually.
人民币比BIS所覆盖的所有其他60种货币升值幅度都要大（混乱的委内瑞拉除外，该国数据因为多重外汇机制并存而被扭曲 ） 。	China's currency has appreciated more than any of the other 60 countries that the BIS covers (apart from dysfunctional Venezuela, where the figures are distorted by multiple foreign-exchange regimes).
但GDP增长陷入停滞的国家 — — 越来越多的国家进入了这一范畴 — — 也许会欢迎能够显示真正的进站信号的指标。	Yet countries where GDP has been flagging – an ever-increasing cohort – might welcome new metrics that can show signs of real progress.
失业率一直居高不下，2009年的7870亿美元刺激计划也没能让失业率有所改善；而房价尽管缓慢地开始复苏，但对2008年高峰水平仍然望尘莫及。	Unemployment remains persistently high, despite the $787 billion stimulus package in 2009, and house prices, though recovering slowly, remain far below their pre-2008 peak.
博科圣地不断地袭击当地学校，掀起了一场针对教育的战争 — — 也让过去两年成为尼日利亚儿童权利侵害最严重的时期。	With continued assaults on local schools, Boko Haram has escalated its war against education – making the last two years Nigeria’s worst in terms of the violation of children’s rights.
对欧盟机构发出的信息非常明确：把这项任务交给你们可能是个错误，但既然已经决定，让欧元持续下去就是你们的任务。	The message to EU institutions is clear: It may have been a mistake to give you this task, but the decision was made, so your role now is to make the euro work.
2005 年，无所不能的美国消费者又度过了胜利的一年，尽管增长步伐慢于 2004 年，但总算还是帮助维持住了全球经济的继续增长。	The almighty American consumer had another banner year in 2005, helping sustain global economic growth, albeit at a slower pace than in 2004.
最终，有条件的工作式退休福利在自我挫败的技术官僚手段与不可持续的民粹主义手段之间实现了一种公平妥协。	At the end of the day, conditioning retirement benefits on work represents a fair compromise between the self-defeating technocratic approach and the unsustainable populist approach.
这个远景通常会勾画一副鼓动变革的未来图景，但有时也会绘声绘色地描绘现状 — — 或者辉煌的过去 — — 以抵制变革。	Usually, such a vision provides a scenario for the future that is meant to encourage change, though it may also portray the status quo – or the past – as attractive, thereby encouraging resistance to change.
保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）和约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）认为应该扩大财政刺激，以教育和基础设施投资上的政府支出为目标。	Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz are calling for an even larger fiscal stimulus to target government spending on education and infrastructure investment.
正在调查的一个问题是特朗普竞选团队在确保共和党纲领不包含支持对乌克兰的武器供应条款方面所发挥的作用 — — 对乌军售得到主流共和党人的支持，但俄罗斯当然是反对的。	One matter under investigation is the Trump campaign’s role in ensuring that the Republican platform contained no provisions backing arms supplies for Ukraine – which mainstream Republicans supported, but Russia of course opposed.
如今，微软公司全世界员工总数只有100,000人，谷歌是50,000人，Facebook只有5,000人。	Today, Microsoft employs only 100,000 people worldwide, Google employs 50,000, and Facebook employs just 5,000.
事实上北溪一期管道的运力利用率在2013年仅为43 ％ ， 2014年为65 ％ ， 2015年为71 ％ 。	Indeed, Nord Stream’s capacity-utilization rate was just 43% in 2013, 65% in 2014 and 71% in 2015.
用圣徒来与拉丁美洲福音教派竞争的想法来源已久 — — 随西班��征服者而来的修道士为每一个有核社区（nucleated community）留下了守护圣徒。	The idea of using saints to compete with evangelicals in Latin America goes back a long way – the friars accompanying conquering Spanish troops introduced patron saints in every nucleated community.
在这一努力中，美国新任总统以多快的速度回应阿拉伯－以色列冲突，对欧洲来说是至关重要的。 因为对欧洲来说，耶路撒冷一直比巴格达更加重要，但是，乔治·沃克·布什却拒绝听取这一点。	How fast America’s new president addresses the Arab-Israeli conflict will be of paramount concern to Europeans in this effort. For to them, Jerusalem has always mattered more than Baghdad, but George W. Bush refused to listen.
但在见识过发达国家的微观经济动力（这正是中国的目标）之后，这种说法就站不住脚了 — — 因此习近平也不太可能发表类似观点。	But experience with the microeconomic dynamics of advanced economies (where China is headed) makes this a weak stance – and, thus, one that Xi is unlikely to take.
其2008年的月球任务承担了20个国家的任务，并赢得了国际探月工作小组（International Lunar Exploration Working Group）的国际合作奖。	Its moon mission in 2008, which carried a payload for some 20 countries, won the International Lunar Exploration Working Group’s International Cooperation Award.
问题的其中一部分就是金钱如何占据了上风，不仅仅是独裁国家政权在事实上控制了整个国家经济，民主国家中的企业也在任意使用自己的资源去“影响”政府。	One part of the problem is how money stacks the deck, not just for dictatorships that wield de facto control over the economy, but also in democratic countries, where business is free to use its resources to “influence” government.
今年的大选则在这层分歧之上又加上了更加传统的左右分歧，卷土重来的工党利用了选民对保守党削减预算政策的不满。	This year’s general election superimposed on this a more traditional left-right split, with a resurgent Labour Party capitalizing on voter discontent with Conservative budget cuts.
路透社总编辑史蒂夫·阿德勒（Steve Adler）最近要求同事在报道特朗普政府时将它与外国极权政府等同处理。	Reuters Editor-in-Chief Steve Adler, for his part, recently called on his peers to cover the Trump administration no differently than they would an authoritarian government abroad.
普林斯顿—上个月，阿里贾比尔（Faisal bin Ali Jaber）从祖国也门来到华盛顿，质问美国为何将导弹瞄准他的反基地组织牧师妻舅并把他杀死。	PRINCETON – Last month, Faisal bin Ali Jaber traveled from his home in Yemen to Washington, DC, to ask why a United States drone had fired missiles at, and killed, his brother-in-law, a cleric who had spoken out against Al Qaeda.
从短期看，这会给政府带来成本，尽管产出和就业的增长将会证明“税收支出”是值得的；在这方面，欧盟补贴也许又是值得的投资。	That would be costly for governments in the short term, though an increase in output and employment might well justify the “tax expenditure” involved; here, too, an EU subsidy might be a worthwhile investment.
但专家们越来越担忧细菌性流行病终有一日会所有现有抗生素产生抗药性，而我们的知识产权系统无法产生足够的激励对劲新药的研发。	But experts are increasingly concerned about the potential for pandemics caused by bacteria resistant to all current antibiotics, while our intellectual-property system is failing to create adequate incentives for the development of new varieties.
取缔IUU捕捞还有助于我国遭到过度捕捞的鱼种存量恢复，帮助建立繁荣的索马里国内渔业，并在此过程中增加对数据收集和资源管理的政府支持和资金。	The elimination of IUU fishing would also allow our overfished stocks to recover and help build a prosperous Somali domestic fishery, along with increased government support and funding for data collection and resource management.
但在中盘的经济关系方面，世界已经是多极化了，而美国也不可能不通过与欧洲、日本、中国和其它国家合作就获得自己需要的结果。	But on the middle board of economic relations, the world is already multipolar, and the US cannot obtain the outcomes it wants without the cooperation of Europe, Japan, China, and others.
一些经济学者以及少数决策者（如已故的托马索·帕多亚-夏欧帕（Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa ） ） 早在欧元危机爆发前很久便要求金融机构监督集中化。	Some academic economists, as well as the rare policymaker (such as the late Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa), called for centralized supervision of financial institutions long before the euro crisis erupted.
而在1995年，肯萨罗维瓦，这位作家兼奥戈尼人民生存运动（这是一场爆发在奥戈尼兰地区的草根运动）发起人在被萨尼·阿巴查将军的军政府绞死之前，也提出过同样的要求。	Ken Saro-Wiwa, a writer and founder of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), a grassroots movement in Ogoniland, had called for this as well, before he was hanged by General Sani Abacha’s junta in 1995.
针对欧盟联系国协议的讨论，在加上俄罗斯支持下的东部叛乱，使得人们在生活中原本微不足道的细微区别之上剑拔弩张，紧张不已。	Debate over the association agreement with the European Union, along with the Russian-backed rebellion in the east, had stoked tensions over distinctions that previously played little or no role in people’s lives.
英国退出公决还将具有政治反响，特别是如果保守党因为这一问题而分裂的话 — — 不管结果如何，这个可能性很小。	The Brexit referendum will also have political repercussions, particularly if the Conservative Party splits over the issue – a distinct possibility, regardless of the outcome.
工业占价值增值的比例一直保持在25 % ， 而小微企业占制造业就业的比重高达84 % ， 中��只有25 % 。	Industry’s share of value added is stuck at 25%, and the share of micro and small enterprises in manufacturing employment in India is 84%, compared to 25% in China.
主权债务水平高企，加上金融部门中某些部分的不当行为，放大了欧元区危机，也造成了重要的信心问题，如今需要系统性方案才能解决。	High levels of sovereign debt, together with the behavior of parts of the financial sector, have amplified the crisis in the eurozone and raised important issues of confidence that now require a systemic answer.
因此他不但鼓励伊斯兰教的衣着方式，还建造了一间宏伟的清真寺 — — 其规模即使不算欧洲最大，也是其中之一。	So he encouraged an Islamic dress code and built a huge mosque – one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in Europe.
但是，除非所有欧洲人都意识到拯救欧元的责任（以及与之捆绑在一起的拯救欧元的责任 ） ， 说再多都没有用。	But, unless all Europeans accept responsibility for saving the euro – and, with it, the EU – everything else is shallow rhetoric.
但普京的隐含意思 — — 他正在乌克兰重打二战，俄罗斯将再次拯救犹太人和世界于民族主义迫害者及其欧洲（读作：德国/纳粹）赞助人之手 — — 是决不可信的。	But Putin’s implied argument that in Ukraine he is refighting WWII, with Russia once again rescuing Jews and the world from nationalist pogromists and their European (read: German/ Nazi) sponsors is simply not credible.
跨国公司或国有企业 — — 高技能工人和管理人员的聚集地 — — 的国内分支也是这类企业的一大发源地。	Domestic subsidiaries of multinational firms or state-owned enterprises – which are repositories of skilled workers and managers – are also a source of such firms.
面临当前经济减速的局面，中国本可以回归早先经历过危机考验的方针；但它没有，这可以作为中国领导人愿意抵制外推法另辟蹊径的又一例证。	In the face of the current growth slowdown, China might well have reverted to its earlier, crisis-tested approach; that it did not is another example of the willingness of its leaders to resist extrapolation and chart a different course.
如果市场混淆了中国的长期日程或对此表示悲观，但结构性变化和改革的方向是积极的，那么将会出现在刚刚过去的较为繁荣的光景中所找不到的投资机会。	If markets are confused or pessimistic about China’s longer-term agenda, but if the direction of structural change and reform is positive, there may be investment opportunities that were absent in the more exuberant recent past.
女性并不天生比男性更能治国，但她们通常拥有不同的视角和交际习惯，这对于打破捍卫男性自尊需要竖立起来的藩篱十分重要。	Women are not necessarily better than men at governing, but they often have different perspectives and habits of engagement that can be essential for cutting through the standoffs created by the need to defend male egos.
2013年俄军总参谋长瓦列里·格拉西莫夫（Valery Gerasimov）提出了混合战争学说，将常规武器，经济胁迫，信息操纵和网络攻击融为一体。	In 2013, Russian chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov described a doctrine for hybrid warfare that blends conventional weapons, economic coercion, information operations, and cyber attacks.
相反，如今一个匆匆召开的峰会同意了一个只能覆盖120,000人的配额制度，目的是为了给匈牙利、意大利和希腊提供喘息机会；这个制度将给德国增加31,000难民。	Instead, a quickly convened summit has now agreed on a limited quota system that will cover barely 120,000 people, aimed at providing relief to Hungary, Italy, and Greece; it will bring a further 31,000 refugees to Germany.
布什苦苦等候了几个礼拜，才等来了这次积极的进展。 这使他得以提出在2006年底之前把驻伊美军从原来的133，000人减至100，000人。	Bush waited weeks for a positive development that would allow him to suggest he can reduce troop levels in Iraq from 133,000 to 100,000 by the end of 2006.
日内瓦 — — 世界卫生组织不久前开始警告一种致命新型病原体X病毒。 事实上，X病毒在现实中并不存在，至少目前还是这样。	GENEVA – The World Health Organization recently began sounding the alarm about a deadly new pathogen called Disease X. In fact, Disease X does not actually exist, at least not yet.
在对外界保持了数十年的沉默之后，现年66岁的卡雷最近说，他“在生命中的每一天”都对“在美莱村发生的一切”感到无比自责。	After decades of refusing to speak publicly, Calley, who is now 66, recently said that “not a day goes by” when he does not feel remorse “for what happened that day in My Lai.”
考虑到该国已经出现了投资账户逆差，贸易顺差以及经常账户顺差，似乎应该将其归入到“债务国-偿还国”的行列。	Given that it has been running an investment-income deficit, a trade surplus, and current-account surplus, it seems that it should be classified as a “debtor-repayer.”
事实上，俄罗斯和美国就像比赛开始前的拳手那样围绕彼此转来转去，支持不同派别并试图确保其盟友在多方冲突中占得优势，或至少保持住现有的局势。	Indeed, Russia and the United States are circling each other like boxers before the contest actually begins, supporting different factions and trying to ensure that their allies in the multi-sided conflict are advancing, or at least holding ground.
毕竟俄罗斯是一个广袤的大国，而恐怖分子是渺小的，难以察觉，部分也是因为他们通常使用原始通信工具，难以侦测。	After all, Russia is a vast country, and the terrorist cells are small and notoriously difficult to penetrate, partly because they often use primitive modes of communication that are difficult to detect.
但这一共同的雄心需要共同行动实现，因为必须具备协同、合作和共同信任才能制定保护冲突中的教育机构所需要的新国际安排。	But this shared ambition requires shared action, because it will take collaboration, cooperation, and mutual trust to develop the new international arrangements needed to protect educational institutions in conflicts.
1976年，在一篇题为《如何让暴徒痛苦 》 （ How to Make the Mob Miserable）的文章中，美国经济学家詹姆斯·亨利（James S. Henry）解决了有效性的问题，他将废钞描述为打击黑手党经营之道。	Back in 1976, in an article entitled “How to Make the Mob Miserable,” the American economist James S. Henry addressed the question of effectiveness, prescribing demonetization as a measure to undermine mafia operations.
另外一个现实是，推翻政府尽管困难，却比为型政府营造安全容易得多。 新政府需要这一安全在众目睽睽之下巩固它的权威和赢得合法性。	There is also the reality that removing governments, as difficult as that can be, is not nearly as difficult as creating the security that a new government needs to consolidate its authority and earn legitimacy in the eyes of the public.
乌克兰悲剧发生后，特别是在德国领导人不愿采取制裁措施对抗俄国的情况下，柏林再没有人能为这一立场进行辩护。	After the tragedy in Ukraine, no one in Berlin will be able to defend this stance, particularly given that Germany’s leaders do not want to confront Russia through sanctions.
与专家治国运动同时期的1932年，经济学家约翰·皮斯·诺顿（John Pease Norton）在计量经济学学会发表讲话时提出了建立一个并非金本位而是电力本位的美元。	Parallel with Technocracy, in 1932 the economist John Pease Norton, addressing the Econometric Society, proposed a dollar backed not by gold but by electricity.
注册系统，比如墨西哥的身份证系统（matricula consular ） ， 有助于确保各国了解危机发生时本国移民的为止，包括没有记录在案者。	Registration systems, such as Mexico’s matricula consular, help to ensure that countries know the location of their migrants – including those who are undocumented – in a crisis.
除非多极性能够得到有效的多极方针的配合，否则像叙利亚内战这样的问题将更加频繁 — — 也更加难以解决。	Unless multipolarity is met with an efficient multilateral approach, problems like Syria’s civil war will become much more frequent – and more difficult to resolve.
相反，美国加紧了贸易禁运，要求古巴提供国有化产权的补偿，这让古巴义无反顾地加入了苏联阵营 — — 正中后者下怀。	Instead, the US doubled down on the trade embargo, demanded restitution for nationalized properties, and pushed Cuba irrevocably into the Soviet Union’s waiting arms.
接着，20世纪80年代出现了债务危机，90年代进行了极端的结构性改革，金融崩溃，2001年，全球经济再次衰退。	Then came the debt crisis of the 1980’s, the extreme structural reforms and financial collapses of the 1990’s, and a new global downturn in 2001.
如果中国领导人利用这一契机抛开痛苦的过去与日本共同面对一个崭新的未来，那会使人们确信中国已经真正走向成熟了。	It would be an immensely encouraging sign of China’s growing maturity if its leaders used this moment to look beyond the bitter past toward a new future with Japan.
墨尔本 — — 去年，当波兰外长西科尔斯基赴基辅会谈时，乌克兰官员据说嘲笑他戴着一块廉价的日本手表。	MELBOURNE – Last year, when Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski went to Kyiv for talks, his Ukrainian counterparts reportedly laughed at him because he was wearing a cheap Japanese watch.
强健的企业部门是开放经济的决定性因素，也决定了一国保持 — — 以及改善 — — 公民生活水平的能力。	A robust business sector is decisive in an open economy, as it shapes a country’s ability to preserve – and improve – its citizens’ living standards.
目前，韩国军方领导人发出警告，如果朝鲜再次发动袭击，不但将面临对袭击源头的报复，还将面临针对朝鲜司令部的反击。	Now, South Korean military leaders are warning that if North Korea attacks again, it will face retaliation not just against the proximate source of those attacks, but against the North’s command leadership.
因此 ，中低收入国家应该提供更多的住院训练，而对当前医生供给失衡负有一定责任的美国和英国应该用资金和知识帮助中低收入国家。	Low- and middle-income countries should thus provide more residency programs, and the US and the UK, which bear some responsibility for the current doctor-supply imbalance, should assist them with funding and know-how.
65岁或以上人口占比20年来近乎翻番到23 % ， 而美国的这一比例为13 % ， 欧洲则为16 % 。	The share of those aged 65 or over has nearly doubled over the past two decades, to 23%, compared to 13% for the United States and 16% for Europe.
不过一次又一次地其他主要中央银行 — — 尤其是美联储和欧洲央行 — — 总是会紧接着掉进坑里，并产生同样可怕的后果。	Yet time and again, other major central banks – especially the Fed and the European Central Bank – have been quick to follow, with equally dire consequences.
该提议的逻辑是如果股东频繁买卖自身的股票，企业高管就被迫要在每季度都实现高收益，以确保股价不会下降。	The idea is that when shareowners furiously trade their stock, corporate executives feel pressed to ensure high earnings every quarter, so that the share price does not fall.
结果是有些前进党的支持者待在家里，而另外一些人去为工党投票，以增强后者与前进党联盟处理社会和经济事务的能力。	As a result, some Kadima voters stayed home, while other potential supporters voted for Labor to strengthen its hand in pushing social and economic issues in Kadima-led coalition.
尽管阿富汗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩等地无一例外地得到了国外援助、经济重建和发展的慷慨承诺，但真正用于战后重建的国际援助却少得可怜。	Despite grand promises of foreign aid, economic reconstruction, and development in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere, the actual record of international assistance to post-war reconstruction is gravely deficient.
他的战略 — — 由大规模货币扩张、政府增支和结构性改革组成的“三支箭 ” — —在理论上是可行的。	His strategy – the “three arrows” of massive monetary expansion, increased government spending, and structural reform – is theoretically sound.
我们将继续与土耳其国内的恐怖主义祸害作斗争，与此同时，我们呼吁所有国家不但要为巴黎死难者致哀，更要拒绝任何形式的恐怖主义。	As we continue to fight the scourge of terrorism in our country, we call on all countries not only to mourn the dead in Paris, but to reject terrorism in all of its forms.
但出于一些原因，这些研究无法得出确定的结论，如公立学校也面临激励问题，导致投入程度不够、旷课和频繁的罢工。	But such research is inconclusive for several reasons, not least that public schools face incentive problems of their own, leading to low effort, absenteeism, and frequent strikes.
尽管凯恩斯受到保守派的诋毁，但是在挽救资本主义制度上，他的贡献要比所有亲市场的金融家们加在一起都要大。	While conservatives vilified him, Keynes actually did more to save the capitalist system than all the pro-market financiers put together.
中国发展论坛没有讨论习近平主席正在采取的重拳打击高层腐败行动。 许多人说这妨碍了经济决策，降低了GDP增长。	What was not discussed at the CDF is the major crackdown on high-level corruption that President Xi Jinping is pursuing and that many say is impeding economic decision-making and slowing GDP growth.
但是，如果央行能够在足够长的时间里遏制国内和全球性矛盾，那么内生恢复和最终的政治进步将大大改善概率分布。	If, however, central banks can contain domestic and global inconsistencies long enough, the combination of endogenous healing and eventual political progress would significantly improve the probability distribution.
"因此，13年前该国以""乌克兰人民""的名义宣布独立，而每一个出生在乌克兰领土上的人，无论其民族状况，都被赋予了公民权利。"	"Thus, the country's declaration of independence 13 years ago was made in the name of ""The people of Ukraine,"" and citizenship was offered to everyone who was born on the territory of Ukraine, regardless of nationality."
但由于从这些经济体进口的商品价格更高，美国进口的改变在降低对华双边赤字的同时将增加对这些国家的赤字。	However, because prices of goods from these economies are higher, a shift in US imports would cut the bilateral deficit with China, but cause its deficits with these countries to rise.
如今，欧元区（从希腊开始）和欧盟本身（从英国退出开始）都面临着生存威胁，开明欧洲领导人必须站出来维持朝向加深统一的趋势。	Today, with risks to the survival of both the eurozone (starting with Greece) and the EU itself (starting with Brexit), it will take enlightened European leaders to sustain the trend toward deeper unification.
许多工作实际上不属于“高科技”范畴，相反，用英国人阿达尔·特纳（Adair Turner）的话讲，它们是无需大学教育却需要“亲密接触”的服务性岗位。	Many jobs are, in fact, not “high tech,” but, in the words of Britain’s Adair Turner, “high touch” – service-sector jobs that do not require a university education.
在随后的战斗中，美国夺取了关塔那摩，将之作为海军基地，并主张（根据现在闻名天下的普拉特修正案）拥有干涉古巴的未来权利。	In the fighting that ensued, the US grabbed Guantánamo as a naval base and asserted (in the now infamous Platt Amendment) a future right to intervene in Cuba.
与此同时，许多新兴市场企业以美元或欧元借款，却在某些情况下较为缺乏这些货币形式的收入以配合相应货币的还本付息。	At the same time, many emerging-market corporations borrowed in US dollars or euros, in some cases with little or no dollar revenues to match the dollar-denominated debt service.
这将是一场有趣的创新军备竞赛 — — 极权体制很难获胜，因为基础技术（即区块链）是为了规避或避免权力中央化而设计的。	This will be an interesting innovation arms race – and one that will be hard for authoritarian regimes to win, given that the underlying technology, known as blockchain, was designed to circumvent or avoid the need for centralized power.
在过去三分之一世纪中，美国经济制度的规则被改写，它有利于顶层，有害于整体经济，特别有害于底层80 % 。	Over the last third of a century, the rules of America’s economic system have been rewritten in ways that serve a few at the top, while harming the economy as a whole, and especially the bottom 80%.
至于难民自身，除了那些在首都贝鲁特街头流浪的之外，大部分都被困在难民营或临时收容社区，缺乏足够的医疗卫生和教育机会。	As for the refugees themselves, many are visible in the streets of Beirut, the capital, but most are stuck in camps or temporary host communities, and lack adequate access to health care and schooling.
接着，他指出，我们不可以继续认��这一趋势背后的原因 — — 如食品和能源价格下降、高失业和乌克兰危机等 — — 是暂时现象。	He then argued that we can no longer assume that the drivers of this trend – such as a drop in food and energy prices, high unemployment, and the crisis in Ukraine – are temporary in nature.
但正如大多数的以色列人一样，沙龙首相也确信巴勒斯坦人并不准备进行认真的谈判并履行他们的承诺。 所以他要为一段延长的过渡期做准备。	But convinced - as are most Israelis - that there is no Palestinian partner ready to negotiate seriously and implement its promises, the prime minister wants to prepare for an extended interim period.
在经济周期末期的情况下，名义增长预期超过4 % ， 失业保持低位 — — 更不用说已经出现过热风险 — — 美联储的行动已然落后。	Considering the advanced stage of the economic cycle, forecasts for nominal growth of more than 4%, and low unemployment – not to mention the risk of overheating – the Fed is behind the curve.
但即使它们不这么做，让外国出口商难以赚到美元的措施也会造成美元短缺，在浮动汇率制度下，这会自动刺激美元升值。	But even if they don’t, measures that make it harder for foreign exporters to earn dollars will create a dollar scarcity, which, in an environment of floating exchange rates, will automatically boost the greenback’s value.
2009~2014年间，发展中国家总共获得了2.2万亿美元的净资本流入，部分原因是发达经济体的量化宽松政策在令利率处于近零水平。	During 2009-2014, developing countries collectively received a net capital inflow of $2.2 trillion, partly owing to quantitative easing in advanced economies, which pushed interest rates there to near zero.
迷你电传曾在20世纪八九十年代蓬勃发展，孕育了各种��线应用的雏形，后来正是这些应用引领了全球.com狂潮。	Minitel boomed during the 1980s and 1990s, as it nurtured a variety of online apps that anticipated the global dot-com frenzy.
最后，政府可以对那些新行业的先行者提供一定时期的税收鼓励，联合融资投资，或是在土地或者外汇方面提供方便。	Finally, the government might help pioneering firms in the new industries by offering tax incentives for a limited period, co-financing investments, or providing access to land or foreign exchange.
这些单方面行动和1823年美国所宣布的政策类似，美国的这一政策日后被称为门罗主义（Monroe Doctrine ） ， 门罗主义与其他一系列政策一起，让拉丁美洲成为美国的禁脔。	These unilateral moves resemble the announcement by the United States in 1823 of what became known as the Monroe Doctrine, which, among other things, placed Latin America within a strictly US sphere of influence.
在繁荣时期，考虑进入资产市场的人们，会在不进入资产市场带来的遗憾和进入资产市场可能遭受的损失造成的痛苦之间，进行权衡。	During a boom, people considering getting into asset markets weigh the fear of regret if they don’t against the pain of possible loss if they do.
类似地，尽管人们设想欧洲稳定基金（European Stability Mechanism，ESM）可以用于重组银行，但最终的决定是ESM只能贷款给政府而不是直接为银行风险兜底。	Similarly, though it had been envisaged that the European Stability Mechanism could be used to recapitalize banks, it was eventually decided that the ESM would lend only to governments, rather than assuming bank risk directly.
哈佛大学的迈克尔·桑德尔（Michael Sandel）指出，市场应该有界限，有一些东西不能（也不应该）允许拿钱去买。	Harvard’s Michael Sandel has argued that there should be limits to markets, and that there are things that money cannot (or should not) be allowed to buy.
事实上，德国对美国的双边贸易盈余几乎保持不变，而欧元-美元汇率大幅波动 — — 2011年攀高至1欧元兑1.6美元，最近又下跌到1欧元兑1.04美元。	In fact, Germany’s bilateral trade surplus with the US has barely changed, despite substantial swings in the euro-dollar exchange rate – which was as high as €1:$1.60 in 2011, and as low as €1:$1.04 more recently.
当普京总统以及他的前克格勃刻板的同僚们决定在多大程度上挤压俄罗斯的后共产时代的邻国时，将不必再担心西欧了。	President Vladimir Putin and his administration of ex-KGB clones will no longer have to worry about Western Europe when deciding how hard to squeeze Russia’s postcommunist neighbors.
从地面情形看 — — 若要重建安全、重振经济，这一点至关重要 — — 地方军队必须能够自卫，战胜敌对势力和犯罪团伙。	Viewing the situation from the ground – which is essential if security is to be restored and economic recovery is to be achieved – local militias must be able to defend themselves against rivals or criminal gangs.
他们认为应当签署所有国家都认可的协议 — — 符合科学要求和各国的能力状况，以“绿色就业”和“绿色增长”为基础，打造二十一世纪全球经济的生命线。	They recognized the need for an agreement that all nations can embrace – in line with their capabilities, consistent with what science requires, and grounded in “green jobs” and “green growth,” the lifeline of a twenty-first century global economy.
但是坚决与特朗普站在同一阵线的共和党似乎突然忘记了自己一贯以来对自由贸易的承诺，就跟几个月前它忘记了长期以来对财政审慎政策的承诺那样。	But, then again, the Republican Party, standing in solidarity with Trump, seems suddenly to have forgotten its longstanding commitment to free trade, much like a few months ago, when it forgot its longstanding commitment to fiscal prudence.
在当前通胀率超过2 % 、 市场预期在较长期（从五年远期通胀预期看）也将保持这一通胀率的情况下，十年期国债收益率应该高于4 % 。	With the current inflation rate of more than 2% and markets anticipating a similar inflation rate over the longer term (as measured by five-year five-year-forward inflation expectations), the yield on ten-year Treasury bonds should be above 4%.
各国都应该专注于生产它们生产效率最高的产品，而不是所有东西都生产一些，因为这样能让该国的收入有所提高。	Each country should specialize in producing those things that it produces most efficiently, rather than producing a bit of everything, because that way its income will be higher.
欧元区国家将形成一个更深入一体化的“欧洲A ” ， 而另一个国家集团将涵盖那些更为多样化和松散联结的“欧洲B ” 。	The eurozone countries would form a more deeply integrated “Europe A,” while another group of countries would comprise a more diverse and loosely connected “Europe B.”
或许可能获得克里米亚的完全主权让普京重新考虑了为俄罗斯海军保有叙利亚地中海港口塔尔图斯（Tartus）的价值。	Or perhaps the possibility of regaining full sovereignty over Crimea has led Putin to reconsider the value of retaining Syria’s Mediterranean port of Tartus for the Russian Navy.
一个成功的民主国家需要广泛遍布于政府与民间社会的领导能力；对领导力表现出关注的公民们不单需要学习怎样评判这种能力，并且还要知晓如何身体力行。	A successful democracy requires leadership to be widespread throughout government and civil society. Citizens who express concern about leadership need to learn not only how to judge it, but how to practice it themselves.
新兴经济体反驳道，它们的人均收入仍远低于发达国家，要应对多种多样的发展挑战，它们需要在贸易责任问题上保持灵活性。	Emerging economies counter that their per capita incomes remain far lower than those of their developed counterparts, and insist that addressing their enormous development challenges demands flexibility in terms of their trade obligations.
然而，如果巴西要超越过去几年间在经济上取得的增长水准，就迫切需要改革它的劳工法律，对外贸更加开放，以及提高它的基础教育体系的质量。	Yet, if Brazil is to enjoy growth above the modest levels of the past few years, the country badly needs to reform its labor laws, open itself more to foreign trade, and improve the quality of its primary education system.
随着不平等性日益根深蒂固，有利于促增长的经济政策的共识可能受到影响，从而破坏社会凝聚，刺激政治动荡。	As inequality becomes increasingly entrenched, it can erode the consensus in favor of pro-growth economic policies, undermine social cohesion, and spur political instability.
虽然两座城市都是围绕着一个核心而用许多同心圆构建起来，但耶路撒冷的核心体现了精神价值，而北京则意味着权力。	Both are designed with a core surrounded by concentric circles, but Jerusalem’s core expresses spiritual values, while Beijing’s represents political power.
如果真能这样，总统也许就不再是民族分化的潜在缘由，这样就可以加强乌克兰和俄罗斯人都希望坚持的共同特色。	If so, the presidency would most likely cease to be a potential source of ethnic polarization, thereby strengthening the common identity that both Ukrainian and Russian citizens are committed to upholding.
传统上欧洲各大银行都是贸易融资的主要来源，但由于主权债务资本损失以及（在某些情况中）房产信贷上的损失所导致的资本充足率问题，而今却极度萎缩。	European banks, traditionally a major source of trade finance, have pulled back dramatically, owing to capital-adequacy problems caused by sovereign-debt capital losses and, in some cases, losses from real-estate lending.
问题在于，欧洲央行官员过度注重通过满足短期通胀目标来确保物价稳定 — — 短期通胀被宽泛地定义为“低于但接近2 % ” ，具体而言，就是1.9 % 。	The problem is that ECB officials have become excessively focused on ensuring price stability by meeting a short-term inflation target, defined broadly as “below, but close to, 2%,” with the specific goal being 1.9%.
在20世纪60年代，索马里族人想要立即投票；肯尼亚却希望在其着手建立国家或将对部族的忠诚转变成为统一的肯尼亚身份的同时，等待40到50年再投票。	In the 1960’s, the Somalis wanted to vote right away; Kenya wanted to wait 40 or 50 years while it went about its nation-building, or reshaping tribal allegiances into a Kenyan identity.
化学和生物化学同样拥有坚实的基础¾虽然人体内还有我们未知的领域，但普遍的看法是我们已经掌握了细胞和分子反应的基本方法。	Chemistry and biochemistry are similarly solid -- there are some things we don’t understand about the body, but it is believed that the basic machinery of how cells and molecules interact is known.
标准普尔提出这样一种机制会令信用评级机构“相互竞争、追求创新、改善评估模型、标准和方法的意愿受损 。 ”	Standard & Poor argued that such a mechanism would provide credit rating agencies with “less incentive to compete with one another, pursue innovation, and improve their models, criteria, and methodologies.”
如果把类似的道德因素加入到埃博拉病毒的治疗，我们可以说非洲人比西方人更有备选资格，因为非洲的医疗系统抵御埃博拉病毒的能力较弱。	Putting such a moral spin on the allocation of Ebola treatments, it could be argued that Africans should be selected over Westerners, because Africa’s health-care systems are less able to combat the disease.
到2014年底，随着希腊第二轮救助计划的时间和现金双双告急，而希腊政府眼看要在2015年偿付的另一笔220亿欧元资金也没有着落，三驾马车的官员们也明白了过来。	By the end of 2014, with Greece’s second bailout running out of time and cash, and the government nursing another €22 billion of unfunded debt repayments for 2015, Troika officials were in no doubt.
我们呼吁非洲开发银行成立一个基础设施基金、扩展2013年启动的马诺河计划（Mano River Initiative ） ， 以深化地区一体化为目标。	We ask the African Development Bank to take the initiative in creating an infrastructure fund, an extension of the Mano River Initiative, launched in 2013, with the objective of furthering regional integration.
一项最新研究与卡罗莱纳启蒙工程（Carolina Abecedarian Project）的结果一致。	A recent study tallied the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, a North Carolina social experiment that began in the early 1970s.
另一方面，如果劳动力占收入比重下降的原因是自动化程度的不断提高，那么这一比例的下降压力将会继续，几年前，我以人工智能为背景讨论过这一问题。	If, on the other hand, labor’s share of income is falling because of the inexorable rise of automation, downward pressures on that share will continue, as I discussed in the context of artificial intelligence a few years ago.
在西方，把女人当作财产的说法对应着高度个性化的个人自主权要求 — — 即按照妇女自身的愿望做出决定，而不顾及她作为妻子、母亲、社会成员或宗教信徒的社会角色。	In the West, the counterpoint to the notion of woman as property has been a highly individualistic demand for personal autonomy – decision-making based primarily on a woman’s own wishes, rather than as wife, mother, community member, or worshipper.
实际上大量的实质性移民都在一个很短的时期内聚集到了许多国家，而他们到来的方式是如此随意而杂乱，仿佛从来就没有任何政府尝试控制过似的。	What is true is that large numbers of de facto immigrants have accumulated in many countries in a very short time, in a haphazard way that makes it seem as though no government was ever in control.
1918年流感大爆发夺走了近7,500万人的生命，或世界总人口的3—5 % ， 比第一次世界大战的死亡人数还多出一倍多。	Nearly 75 million people, or 3-5% of the world’s population, died in just a few months during the 1918 influenza pandemic – more than twice the number of people killed in World War I.
以色列和美国分裂加沙和西岸同时回避在能够使阿巴斯最终削弱哈马斯的和平协议上的谈判的策略本身就是一场战争。	The Israeli-American strategy of driving a wedge between Gaza and the West Bank while shunning negotiations on a peace settlement that could give Abbas the ultimate tool to undermine Hamas is a policy at war with itself.
至于一胎政策，据中国卫生部门2013年公布的数据看，从1971—2012年，光是注册家庭就发生了3.36亿起堕胎 — — 比美国人口总数还要大。	As for the one-child policy, data released by China’s health ministry in 2013 indicate that from 1971 to 2012, 336 million abortions – more than the entire US population – were carried out in registered facilities alone.
过去几周似乎在竞相比拼工党内部谁在伊斯兰-左翼主义道路上走得最远。 唉，这在欧洲左翼已经形成了难以扭转的趋势，而且最严重的就是英国工党。	The past few weeks have seemed like a contest to see who in Labour would go the farthest down the path of Islamo-leftism, which is, alas, a strong tendency within the European left and among Britain’s Labourites in particular.
以传统汽车业向电动运输产业的转变为例，尽管欧洲厂家仍存在主导市场的幻想，但在这一转变中起决定作用的将只能是中国。	Consider the transition from the traditional automobile to electric transport. Despite European illusions to the contrary, this will be decided in China, not in the West.
一国对某少数群体实施恐怖统治，以至于他们不得不逃往，或者某族人的祖先因为战败带着恐惧��到某地，这样的经历对于民族身份而言绝非令人振奋的源泉。	The knowledge that one’s country terrorized a minority to the point that its members had to flee, or that a substantial share of one’s forebears arrived in defeat and panic, is not exactly an inspiring source of national identity.
我们看到南欧地区各主要银行的信用违约互换（Credit default swaps ，CDS）交易价格都比其所属国家的CDS价格还要稍低一点，意味着市场预期政府将无法对银行予以支撑。	Credit default swaps (CDS) of major southern European banks trade slightly lower than the CDS of their sovereign states, indicating that the market does not perceive the latter as able to support the former.
据国际货币基金组织统计，2014年乌克兰的公共开支合共相当于GDP的53 ％ ， 到而在2016年却下降到了40 ％ 。	According to the IMF, Ukraine’s public expenditures in 2014 totaled 53% of GDP, but had fallen to 40% of GDP by 2016.
与此相反，芝加哥大学尤金·法玛（Eugene Fama）阐述了一个理念，认为金融理论其实跟一个 “空想”那样谬误，并认为“金融市场和金融机构不是经济衰退的始作俑者，而是受害者 。 ”	On the contrary, the University of Chicago’s Eugene Fama has described the notion that finance theory was at fault as “a fantasy,” and argues that “financial markets and financial institutions were casualties rather than causes of the recession.”
作为投资者、消费者、选民和公民，我们必须让我们的声音被听见，以确保金融被用来增进共同价值观和共同利益。	As investors, consumers, voters, and citizens, we must make our voices heard, in order to ensure that finance is used to promote shared values and the common good.
相反，成功的产业政策要识别具有正外部性的资源 — — 即本部门学习可能给经济的其他部门带来好处的部门。	Rather, successful industrial policies identify sources of positive externalities – sectors where learning might generate benefits elsewhere in the economy.
因此，在本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke）的领导下，美联储转向了通过量化宽松注入流动性，这意味着它彻底沦为金融市场的产物。	And so the Fed, under Ben Bernanke’s leadership, turned to the liquidity injections of quantitative easing, making it even more of a creature of financial markets.
沃尔夫还报道说，伊万卡和她的丈夫、白宫高级幕僚贾雷德·库什纳（Jared Kushner）还商定，在实现了预期中在白宫的成功后，让伊万卡来当总统。	Wolff also reports that Ivanka and her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, had agreed that after their expected smashing success at the White House, it would be Ivanka who would run for president.
尽管制裁不大可能改变克里米亚地位或导致俄罗斯士兵撤出乌克兰，但在证明侵犯别国领土者不能逍遥法外这个意义上，制裁捍卫了这项基本原则。	Though sanctions are unlikely to change Crimea’s status or lead to withdrawal of Russian soldiers from Ukraine, they have upheld that principle, by showing that it cannot be violated with impunity.
但人造计算机效率低下不仅是因为它们需要为芯片供能，也是因为它们需要能源运行空调从而带走处理器所产生的热量。	But man-made computers are so inefficient not only because they need to power the chips, but also because they need energy to run the air conditioners that remove the heat generated by the processors.
加强社会保障的呼吁与三中全会建议国有企业将利润的30%投入到养老金和医疗保健等社会安全网计划的要求一致。	The call for enhanced social security is consistent with the Third Plenum’s proposal to allocate 30% of state-owned enterprises’ profits to fund safety-net programs such as pensions and health care.
发自贝鲁特 — — 来自世界银行，联合国和阿拉伯联盟的一份接一份报告都强调，低下的受教育程度才是导致阿拉伯世界不发达的主要原因。	BEIRUT – Report after report from the World Bank, United Nations Development Program, and the Arab League emphasize that the education deficit in the Arab world is among the main causes of its underdevelopment.
正如在中国一样，市场化改革的优势需要时间来展现，然而在过去的几年间，越南已经体验到了中国曾经体验过的快速经济发展和贫困下降。	As in China, it took time for the benefits to appear, but over the past few years Vietnam has seen the same rapid, poverty-reducing growth that China has experienced.
这无疑是一个真正的难题，但多亏哥本哈根以来取得的进展，尽管完成任务或许难度很大，许多国家仍然会怀揣着对未来的希望来参加坎昆会议。	This is the real challenge, and although it may prove ambitious, many countries will arrive at the Cancún conference with renewed hope for the future, thanks to the progress made since Copenhagen.
但一个重要的区别在于，如果参加别国军队的人被迫放弃美国公民权，他们就很有可能加入他们为之战斗的国家的国籍。	But one important difference is that if people who join other countries’ military forces lose their US citizenship, they can presumably become citizens of the country for which they are fighting.
英国和欧盟已经处于半脱离状态 — — 它身处申根协议之外，没有参加欧元区，许多内政事务（包括避难政策）也和欧盟不同。	Britain is already semi-detached – outside of Schengen and with opt-outs from the euro and many home-affairs matters (including asylum policy).
埃尔多安的正义与发展党（AKP）2002年利用2001年的严重外汇危机上台掌权，而在外汇危机之前的半个世纪中，土耳其增长波动剧烈。	Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002, following a severe foreign-exchange crisis in 2001, which itself was preceded by a half-century of volatile growth.
这并不意味着亚洲只是亚洲人的亚洲；但这可能意味着美国地区作用的减弱 — — 特别是美国将随着2015年总统选举季的开始而转向国内时。	This may not yet mean Asia for only the Asians; but it could mean a reduced regional role for the US – especially as America turns inward during the presidential election season that starts this year.
据国际货币基金组织（IMF ） ， 伊朗GDP年增长率略高于4 % ， 此外，令人鼓舞的指标显示，在后制裁时代，增长扩大到了非石油部门。	According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran’s GDP is growing at an annual rate of just over 4%, with encouraging indications that in the post-sanction era, growth is broadening to the non-oil sectors.
这一点非常重要，因为新陈代谢能力较低者与能力较高者相比，其清除某些药物的速度较慢，生理系统中药物残存量较大。	That is important because low metabolizers clear certain drugs slowly and have more medication in their systems for longer periods of time than high metabolizers.
BEC的观点 — — “新模式将是政府、研究机构和投资者之间的公私合作 ” — —为这一关系带来了希望的曙光。	The BEC’s argument – that the “new model will be a public-private partnership between governments, research institutions, and investors” – shines a welcome spotlight on the relationship.
甚至在受过高等教育的人群中，人们也愿意把国家的地位放在宗教之下，而这个现象才是巴基斯坦危机的症结所在。	This willingness to subordinate state to God, even among the highly educated, lies at the heart of Pakistan’s crisis.
新的模式表现出了政府的慷慨，但是这种补助能否无限期地持续下去？ 当补助停发时，一千五百万领取家庭补助金的家庭能否维持现有收入水平？	Third, Rousseff's rhetoric and origins as a militant leftist feed doubts as to whether she will pursue Lula's pragmatic, centrist economic and social policies.
虽然期待女性就所有问题达成一致或在政治生涯中对性别问题同等敏感既不合理也不现实，但认为女性领导人独特的经历会影响其思想却不失为一种公平的假设。	While it is unreasonable – and indeed undesirable – to expect that women will agree on all issues or be equally gender-sensitive in their politics, it is fair to assume that a female leader’s ideas will be informed by her unique experiences.
俄罗斯几乎立即就对格鲁吉亚实行了惩罚，它禁止从格鲁吉亚进口葡萄酒和矿泉水这两个格鲁吉亚主要的出口产品。	Russia punished Georgia almost immediately, banning the import of Georgian wines and mineral waters – both of which are key export goods.
要理解为何货币可以在成为社会至高商品的同时具备负价格，一个有益的起点是认识到和土豆不同，货币没有内在私人价值。	To understand how money can be our societies’ supreme good while fetching a negative price, it helps to start with the realization that, unlike potatoes, money has no intrinsic private value.
所以，在我们西方人对中国的质量控制问题严厉批评之前，我们应该想到正是我们合谋让中国成为世界的工业园和许多有毒产业的全球倾卸场。	So, before we in the West becomes too censorious of China’s quality control problems, we should remember our complicity in making China the world’s industrial park and global dumping ground for many toxic industries.
另外一场类似的选举，包括准备在一月举办的那场，也很可能不会举行，主要原因则是巴解组织和哈马斯之间的持续冲突，而后者控制着加沙地区。	Another such election in the near future, including the one set for January, is unlikely to occur, mainly owing to the continuing rift between the PLO and Hamas, which controls Gaza.
当《花花公子》今年早些时候宣布它计划在印尼发行没有裸体的版本时遭到了政治家和保守宗教领导人的强烈谴责，他们认为这是对传统价值观的一种威胁。	When Playboy unveiled plans for a nudity-free Indonesian edition early this year, it was denounced by politicians and conservative religious leaders as a threat to traditional values.
在其他地区，恐吓工作由政府爪牙来完成：在南非，政治关系深厚的古普塔（Gupta）家族将目标对准了批评总统祖玛的前《商业日报 》 （ Business Day）和《金融邮报 》 （ Financial Mail）编辑彼得·布鲁斯（Peter Bruce ） 。	Elsewhere, government cronies do the bullying: in South Africa, the politically connected Gupta family has targeted former Business Day and Financial Mail editor Peter Bruce for criticizing President Jacob Zuma.
南极西部冰盖突然“跨过临界点”进入到一种全新状态，而并没有在全球变暖影响下呈现出可以预测的渐进性改变。	Rather than reacting to global warming with gradual and predictable patterns of change, the West Antarctic ice sheet has suddenly “tipped” into a new state.
阿拉伯之春、美国在穆斯林世界的影响力下降、民众决定发出声音，在这样一个环境下，史无前例和无法预测是唯一可以确定的。	The Arab Spring, America’s declining influence in the Muslim world, and citizens’ determination to be heard have combined to create an environment in which the unprecedented and the unpredictable are the only certainties.
他宣称，因为这些理想，美国“仍然是所有梦想自由的人们的希望灯塔，也为全世界树立了一个自由民族能够实现的成就的楷模 。 ”	Because of these ideals, he proclaimed, the United States “remains a beacon of hope for all who dream of liberty and a shining example to the world of what a free people can achieve.”
左翼和右翼的民粹主义者，其中某些还带有独裁主义倾向，在巴西和墨西哥两国今年晚些时候举行总统大选前的民意调查中处于领先地位。	Populists of the right and the left, some with authoritarian leanings, lead opinion polls in Brazil and Mexico ahead of presidential elections in both countries later this year.
第三种解释是这三年间的缓慢增长是拜投资萎靡和长期失业所赐，而后两者的原因在于2008—2009年的深度衰退严重影响了资本存量和劳动力的规模和技能。	The third interpretation for slow growth during these three years is that the depressed investment and long-term unemployment caused by the deep recession of 2008-2009 had taken a toll on the capital stock and the size and skills of the labor force.
相比之下，美国食品和药物管理局强制执行最高的产品标准，也就是说在跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系下，欧洲消费者将以更低的价格获得更高质量的产品。	By contrast, the US Food and Drug Administration enforces the highest product standards, meaning that, under the TTIP, European consumers would gain access to higher-quality products at lower prices.
这也意味着与发展中国家合作帮助它们开发现代清洁能源资源以提供廉价的地方生产电力，更不能强迫它们购买化石燃料。	It also means working with developing countries to help them develop modern, clean energy sources that provide cheap, locally produced power, and do not oblige them to buy fossil fuels.
比如，在非洲大部，年轻人对政治早已幻灭，认定胜者永远是富有的年长者，他们推动自己的利益，牺牲年轻一代的利益。	In many regions of Africa, for example, young people are disillusioned with politics, convinced that wealthy older people will always prevail and advance their own interests, often at the expense of younger generations.
MIP的第二个缺陷是它缺少稀缺货币条款为债务国所提供的遗漏保护（omit protection ） 。	The MIP’s second flaw is that it lacks the omit protections for debtors that are afforded by the scarce-currency clause.
尽管这些问题是全球性的，但在新兴市场中最为紧迫，新兴市场的社会和经济进步正在因此受到打击，而世界越来越依赖新兴市场的社会和经济进步。	While these issues are global, they are most urgent in emerging markets, where they are undermining the social and economic progress on which the rest of the world increasingly relies.
腾讯、大疆和华为等中国企业的创新能力不输于任何美国公司，而中国CEO们也在国内推动加强知识产权保护。	Chinese firms like Tencent, DJI, and Huawei are as innovative as any US company, and Chinese CEOs are pushing for stronger intellectual-property protection at home.
政府间体系在贸易谈判以及武器扩散的挑战之下瓦解，就难以掌握气候变化问题所带来的千头万绪和众多既得利益。	An inter-governmental system that falls apart under the challenges of trade negotiations and proliferation threats is unlikely to master the deep complexity and multitudinous vested interests that the issue of climate change entails.
在此之前，干细胞 — — 能够重新编码使之发育成丢失或受损组织 — — 只能通过早期胚胎获得，因而激发了伦理争议。	Before this, stem cells – which can potentially be reprogrammed to develop into replacements for lost or damaged tissue – could be taken only from early-stage embryos, a practice that fueled ethical controversy.
但二十一世纪的东亚和二十世纪的欧洲之间存在一个重要区别，因此带来了一个避免所有四个选择的机会：中国有能力给核威胁源头施加巨大的压力。	But an important difference between twenty-first-century East Asia and twentieth-century Europe creates a chance to avoid all four: China is in a position to exert powerful pressure on the source of the nuclear threat.
智利与邻国相比经济比较正规 — — 但很多民众 — — 尤其是妇女和年轻人 — — 要么没有工作，要么没有合同。	Chile’s is more formal than that of its neighbors, but many people – especially women and the young – either have no job or work without a contract.
随着退欧进程的展开 — — 按照正式安排，应该在明年3月完成 — — 英国-欧盟关系的未来性质这一根本性问题仍然没有得到回答。	As the march toward Brexit – formally set for the end of next March – proceeds, fundamental questions about the nature of the future UK-EU relationship remain unanswered.
前不久，美国食品药物管理局(FDA)在所有的抗抑郁类药品标签上添加“黑框”警告，但却无法限制于个人使用此类药品。	More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) applied a ”black box” warning to all antidepressant drugs labelling, but fell short of restricting the use of any individual drug.

从种植者的角度而言，通过销售平贸易产品而得到溢价要比无论他们是否工作或者他们的产品质量如何而得到慈善捐助更为可取。	From the growers’ perspective, receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce.
它处于银行监管者以及储蓄保险的控制之外，通过帮助向购买者提供更多的信用来享受房价的暴涨所带来的利益。	The shadow banking system, which is beyond the reach of bank regulators and deposit insurance, fed the boom in home prices by helping provide more credit to buyers.
但这种简单把杠杆转向公共部门 — — 每减少一点私人债务相对GDP的比率都意味着公共债务比率的上升的方式效果如何：请参见爱尔兰和西班牙政府堆积如山且不断攀升的负债。	But that simply shifts leverage to the public sector, with any reduction in the ratio of private debt to GDP more than matched by an increase in the public-debt ratio: witness the Irish and Spanish governments’ high and rising debt burdens.
他拒绝跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）的计划也是如此，中国已经开始试图用一个不包括美国的地区贸易协定取而代之。	The same can be said for his rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which China is already trying to replace with a regional trade pact that would exclude the US.
事实上，中国应当表明态度，尽管也很希望朝鲜能继续存在并走向繁荣，但倘若后者一意孤行，它也有能力承担这个昔日盟友土崩瓦解的后果。	Indeed, China should make clear that, much as it would prefer North Korea to survive and prosper, it could afford to allow its erstwhile ally to implode.
对美国来说，唯一的前进之路是通过充满活力的开放的全球合作实现二十一世纪科学技术的潜力，战胜贫困、疾病和环境威胁。	The only sane way forward for the US is vigorous and open global cooperation to realize the potential of twenty-first-century science and technology to slash poverty, disease, and environmental threats.
当时美国国民已经厌倦了战事，渴望重投孤立主义以寻找一丝安慰，因此美国在越南的溃败似乎意味着其将大规模收缩部署在亚洲的军队规模。	Back then, that debacle seemed to presage a broader US withdrawal from Asia, with a war-weary American public seeking the supposed comforts of isolationism.
对我们大多数人而言，这个循环是中等大小，界限分明—比如，它是否包括干细胞？ - - 能够成为痛苦和冲突的源头。	For most of us, the circle is mid-sized, and working out its precise boundaries – does it include stem cells, for instance? – can be a source of anguish and conflict.

它们的独立源于苏联的解体，并且虽然一些国家发生了革命，大多数前苏联地区社会精英和政治文化仍然根深蒂固。	With the crucial exception of energy-rich Azerbaijan, they have few natural resources or high-value manufactures, and have large agricultural sectors.
那些阻碍短期资本流入的税收工具和准备金要求应与反周期措施紧密结合，例如提出额外的资本要求以遏制国内的信贷活动。	Tax instruments and reserve requirements that put sand in the wheels of short-term capital inflows should be combined with strong countercyclical measures, such as additional capital requirements, to slow domestic credit creation.
金正日之死让我想起了毛泽东，在当时的中国，这个自封为神的人物的陨落引发了全体中国人的歇斯底里 — — 不管是真是假。	His death made me recall that of Mao Zedong, with all the mass hysteria – real and feigned – that accompanies the demise of a self-anointed god.
尽管已经掌握对健康威胁的大量证据，但许多国家仍往往忽视空气质量标准和有效区域合作所需的排放监测 — — 主要原因是政府害怕对国内经济产生影响。	Despite the overwhelming evidence of health risks, many countries routinely ignore air-quality standards – as well as the emissions monitoring needed for effective regional cooperation – mainly owing to governments’ fear of their economic impact.
-理事会应该增加若干个（可能3-5个）独立成员扩充规模（如同私营部门那样 ） ， 并且投票原则应为一人一票的表决制。	- The Executive Board should be enlarged by the addition of several (possibly 3-5) independent members (as in the private sector), and the voting principle should be one person, one vote.
以色列人认为为了避免更严厉的经济制裁和军事打击，伊朗狡猾地利用美国对和谈的幻想，加紧研发的脚步，实际上，伊朗正在飞奔地加入核俱乐部的行列，	Israelis believe that Iran is galloping into the nuclear club, and will shrewdly use the prospect of talks with the US to pre-empt tougher sanctions or a military strike.
他“认为机器取代人力劳动往往会给劳动阶级造成伤害 ” ， “在国家净收入获得提高的同时，可能造成人口过剩 。 ”	He was now “convinced that the substitution of machines for human labor is often very injurious to the class of laborers,” that the “same cause which may increase the net revenue of the country, may at the same time render the population redundant.”

2010年和2011年，由于中国经济的蓬勃发展仍然对德国机械和汽车保持着高需求，德国年均GDP增长超过3 % ； 但当中国GDP增长放缓，德国年增长率也随之下降到低于1 % 。	Annual GDP grew by more than 3% in 2010 and 2011, because a still-booming Chinese economy was sustaining high demand for German machines and cars; but, as China’s GDP growth has slowed, so has Germany’s, to an annual rate of less than 1%.
有了出乎意料、计划之外的民众反抗，基利奇达罗格乌似乎巩固了其作为更大的（尽管相当脆弱的）反对派领导人的角色。	With his unexpected, unplanned civil disobedience, Kiliçdaroğlu seems to have consolidated his role as the leader of a larger, somewhat fragmented, opposition.
但这样的国家几乎无一例外地为“自然资源的诅咒”所困：自然资源丰富的国家不仅发展没有预期的好，而且往往在现实中比没有这些资源优势的国家发展得差。	But, with few exceptions, such countries are afflicted with the so-called “natural resource curse”: countries with an abundance of resources not only do not do as well as expected, but actually do worse than countries without such benefits.
消费支出的增加和住宅投资升高提振了劳动力需求，因此，4月就业注册人数增加了288,000人，而今年此前的平均月度数字为200,000。	Higher consumer spending and increased residential investment boosted demand for labor, resulting in a rise in payroll employment of 288,000 in April, up from a monthly average of less than 200,000 earlier in the year.
没有一位共和党投票支持奥巴马的医疗立法，即使该立法建立在一些共和党官员和著名智库所支持的机制模式基础上。	No Republican voted for Obama’s health-care legislation, even though it was modeled on schemes backed by some Republican officials and prominent think tanks.
反过来，这又让泛欧洲和平与安全秩序的愿景变得更加艰难，而这一愿景是自阿登纳以来历任德国政府的核心外交政策目标。	That, in turn, would make it even harder to pursue the vision of a pan-European order of peace and security, a core foreign-policy goal of all German governments since that of Konrad Adenauer.
1992年的马斯特里赫特条约要求欧洲政府将公共债务水平限制在GDP的60%以内，年度预算限制在GDP的3%以内。	The 1992 Maastricht Treaty committed European governments to cap public debt at 60% of GDP, and annual budget deficits at 3% of GDP.

此外，2001年9·11恐怖袭击让非国家行动方和存在麻烦的宗派和种族冲突的所谓“失败”国家成为新的安全隐患。	Moreover, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, made non-state actors and so-called “failing” states with troubling sectarian and ethnic conflicts a new security concern.
比如，日本将发现TPP增强了“安倍经济学 ” 。 安倍经济学是日本首相安倍晋三在2012年推出的三管齐下的重振经济战略。	Japan, for example, will find that the TPP enhances “Abenomics,” the three-pronged economic-revitalization strategy introduced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2012.
以色列可能会成为“欧洲”的一部份，而在未来一段时间内其主要盟友依然会是美国，但以色列领导人必须着手思考究竟如何在一个后西方时代挣扎求存。	Israel may be “of Europe,” and its main ally may well remain the United States for many years to come, but Israeli leaders must start thinking of how their country can thrive in a post-Western world.
大规模公共工程，特别是当它们的唯一目的是尽快让尽可能多的人口回到工作中去时，会导致生产率较高的岗位出现劳动力短缺。	Large-scale public projects, particularly when they are aimed simply at putting as many people as possible quickly back to work, will lead to a shortage of labor available for more productive jobs.

金融全球化意味着银行在它们的账簿上不再持有像抵押贷款这样的资产，而是把它们打包成资产支持证券后出售给全世界资本市场的投资者，从而把风险扩散到更大的范围。	Financial globalization meant that banks no longer held assets like mortgages on their books, but packaged them in asset-backed securities that were sold to investors in capital markets worldwide, thereby distributing risk more widely.
类似地，克林顿以六个百分点的优势赢得受过大学教育的白人女性的支持，但她在未上过大学的白人女性上输掉了28个百分点，在未上过大学的白人男性上输掉了49个百分点。	Similarly, Clinton won the support of white, college-educated women by six points; but she lost white non-college-educated women by 28 points and white non-college-educated men by 49 points.

比如，最近苹果公司的名声就受到了打击，因为据披露，iPhone和iPad的主要生产线 — — 位于中国的富士康工厂工作环境恶劣。	For example, Apple’s brand was recently shaken by revelations about brutal workplace conditions at Foxconn factories in China, where most of its iPhones and iPads are assembled.
在突尼斯，前总统本·阿里的亲朋好友获得了2010年私人部门总利润的21 % ， 尽管他们的企业只雇用了突尼斯劳动力总量的1 % 。	In Tunisia, former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s cronies received 21% of all private-sector profits in 2010, though their firms employed only 1% of Tunisia’s labor force.
鉴于许多国家中涌现出大量反建制甚至民族主义情绪，国际机构也必须对他们致力于服务的全球公众持有更加开放（和殷切）的态度。	Given strong anti-establishment and even nationalist sentiment in many countries, international institutions must also be more open with – and responsive to – the global public that they are supposed to serve.
“如果你有一点小病，是阿富汗人或巴基斯坦人，那么在你能够和官员说上话前，要等上12个月 ， ” 一位难民对我们说。	“If you are a little ill, Afghani or Pakistani, it may take 12 months before you speak to an official,” one refugee told us.

在弗里德曼的原文中，自然失业率是一个纯理论推测，建基于称之为“理性预期”的假设，尽管它违背了任何理性行为的标准定义。	In Friedman’s original work, the natural unemployment rate was a purely theoretical conjecture, founded on an assumption described as “rational expectations,” even though it ran counter to any normal definition of rational behavior.
但是，荷兰右翼反穆斯林的自由党领导人怀德对于荷兰女王的“多元文化废话”极为反感，乃至于他想剥夺女王在政府中的宪法地位。	But Geert Wilders, leader of the right-wing, anti-Muslim Freedom Party, was so disgusted by the Dutch queen’s “multi-cultural rubbish” that he wanted her to be stripped of her constitutional role in the government.
许多法国作家也对国家衰弱的状况表达了他们真实的感受，许多普通百姓则相信全球经济规则与法国国家利益背道而驰。	Many French writers also express a vivid feeling of national decline, and many ordinary citizens believe that the rules of the global economy work against French national interests.

这些国债可以在任何时候卖给欧洲央行，换取等额现金；但是，只要它们的收益率高于欧洲央行存款，银行持有国债就是有利可图的。	The T-bills could be sold to the ECB at any time, making them tantamount to cash; but, as long as they yield more than deposits with the ECB, the banks would find it advantageous to hold them.
一切重大能源基础设施新投资都隐含着长达几十年的运行周期，因为，即使需求和价格大幅下降，所有者或投资者仍会多多少少捞回一些资本收益回报。	Implicit in any major new investment in energy infrastructure is that operations will continue for decades, as even if demand and prices fall dramatically, an owner or investor will prefer some income return on that capital rather than nothing.

最终，尽管财政部赞扬了倒闭银行基本破产（basic bankruptcy）的优点，但拒绝撤销监管机构领衔银行重组的权力。	Ultimately, while the Treasury extolled the virtues of basic bankruptcy for failed banks, it rejected repealing regulators’ powers to lead bank restructurings.
第二，中国和俄国的金融体系缺乏透明，而巴西和印度则在金融领域尚有待开发，进一步融入世界经济就存在风险，而金融危机的可能会增加。	Second, China and Russia have financial systems that lack transparency, while Brazil and India are financially underdeveloped, putting further integration in the world economy at risk and increasing prospects for a financial crisis.
莫·易卜拉欣奖曾分别颁发给莫桑比克前总统阿金·希萨诺（Joaquim Chissano，2007年度 ） ， 博茨瓦纳前总统费斯图斯·莫哈埃（Festus Mogae，2008年度）以及佛得角前总统佩德罗·皮雷斯（Pedro Verona Pires，2011年度 ） 。	The Ibrahim Prize was awarded in 2007, 2008, and 2011 to Presidents Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Festus Mogae of Botswana, and Pedro Verona Pires of Cape Verde, respectively.
法国在1998年赢得世界杯后，他们把这归功于自己球队的多元化民族 — — 这是法国自由、平等和博爱信仰的化身。	When the French won the World Cup in 1998, they ascribed it to their team’s multi-ethnicity – the embodiment of France’s commitment to liberté, égalité, fraternité.
中国太阳能电池板制造企业估计比美国同行成本低20 % ， 因为他们实现了规模经济以及更先进的供应链开发。	Chinese solar-panel manufacturers are estimated to have a 20% cost advantage over their US peers, owing to economies of scale and more advanced supply-chain development.
而另一方面，联合国成员国和世界各地民众则要求联合国在更多地方发挥前所未有的作用 — — 这种趋势在2011年不会发生改变。	On the other hand, UN member states and people around the world are asking it to do more, in more places, than ever before – a trend that will continue in 2011.
上述惯例法规定男性亲属比女性家庭成员对死者财产享有更大的继承权，并且一般完全否认妻子并基本忽视女儿的继承权。	Those customary laws give male relatives a greater claim to the deceased’s possessions than female members of his family, and typically bar wives altogether and give short shrift to daughters.
祖克曼指出，公司可以迁移法律总部，利用转移定价等手段改变税负，但将雇员从一国转移到另一国困难得多，而客户则根本无法转移。	As Zucman points out, a corporation can move its legal headquarters and use mechanisms like transfer pricing to shift its tax burden, but moving its employees across national borders is more difficult, and it cannot move its customers.
这一重大变化反映了FARC在长年斗争之后实力的极大削弱、哥伦比亚社会的韧性，以及（也许是最重要的）桑托斯的高明地区政策。	This momentous shift reflects the decimation of the FARC following long years of struggle, the resilience of Colombian society, and, perhaps most important, Santos’s brilliant regional policy.
美国剑桥—欧洲移民危机暴露出正在进行的关于经济不平等性的争论的一个根本性缺陷 — — 或者令人瞩目的伪善。	CAMBRIDGE – Europe’s migration crisis exposes a fundamental flaw, if not towering hypocrisy, in the ongoing debate about economic inequality.
紧绷的市场已经大为缓和；爱尔兰和葡萄牙不再需要援助计划；欧元区金融系统因为迈向银行联盟的决定而有所强化；危机管理工具也已经就位。	Market tension has eased considerably; Ireland and Portugal are not under assistance programs anymore; the eurozone financial system has been strengthened by the decision to move to a banking union; and crisis-management instruments are in place.
他们的重要议程之一就是攻击中央银行并用斯大林时代式的指控中伤其行长，被称为波兰经济转型之父的Leszek Balcerowicz。	One of their priorities is to attack the central bank and slander its governor, Leszek Balcerowicz, the iconic father of Poland’s economic transformation, with accusations that echo those of the Stalinist era.
但塞浦路斯与三驾马车（欧盟委员会、国际货币基金组织和欧洲央行）达成初步协议或许意味着最坏的结果已经避免。	But the tentative agreement between Cyprus and the troika (the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank) probably means that the worst has been avoided.
但是还没有一位能代表全欧洲声音的政治家出现，也没有任何欧洲主要组织有勇气对当前形势发表自己的见解，更不用说对将来提议一个战略性计划。	But no pan-European statesman has emerged, and no major European institution has even had the courage to provide its own analysis of the current situation, much less propose a strategic scenario for the future.
习近平和奥巴马就朝鲜进行了“直率的”讨论，接着又在未和其正式盟友朝鲜会晤的情况下与韩国总统朴槿惠进行了峰会。	Following the “frank” discussion of North Korea by Xi and Obama, Xi hosted a summit with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, without first meeting with its official North Korean ally.
在未来几年，我们将不得不设法在众多经济体制，历史，文化和社会偏好截然不同的国家之间建立一个“公平”的全球贸易体系。	In the years ahead, we are going to have to figure out how to create a “fair” global trading regime among countries with fundamentally different economic systems, histories, cultures, and societal preferences.
上述情形使政策陷入两难境地：失业率上升使得美国和别国的政治家不得不考虑出台新的财政刺激计划以提振萎靡的需求和疲软的就业。	This leads to a policy dilemma: rising unemployment rates are forcing politicians in the US and other countries to consider additional fiscal stimulus programs to boost sagging demand and falling employment.
在移动设备在线零售领域，去年阿里巴巴占据了84.2%的市场份额，第二大在线零售商京东只获得了5.7%的市场。	In online retailing via mobile devices, Alibaba held an 84.2% share of the market last year, with the next largest online retailer, JD.com, capturing just 5.7%.
这种临界点是否是人类活动的结果目前尚不清楚 — — 但在人类开始干预地球能量平衡前长达11,500年的全新世时期却从未出现过类似的改变。	It is not completely clear whether humans have caused this tipping – though nothing like it has ever occurred during the 11,500-year Holocene period before humans started interfering with the planet’s energy balance.
瑞典皇家学院（Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences）颁发该奖项，但瑞典同时也是发达的社会民主国家。	The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the prize, but Sweden was also an advanced social democracy.
现在后帝国时代的下滑结束后，从决定其命运的“英国脱欧”公投中应当吸取的最重要的教训是不能靠取悦民族主义者来打败民族主义。	Now that its post-imperial decline is complete, the most important lesson to take away from the “Brexit” referendum that sealed its fate is that one cannot defeat nationalism by pandering to nationalists.
很多信奉科学的人都在经历着一场革命，很多这样的想法，有时甚至是革命性的想法，正在从未与大型机构挂钩的实验室和研究中心蒸腾而出。	Many scientific disciples are going through a revolution, and a lot of those ideas -- sometimes revolutionary ideas -- are bubbling up from labs and research centers that are unaffiliated with large institutions.
但无论真相在守旧者看来多么残酷，事实是将诺贝尔文学奖授予某位只写过一部作品的作者并不比授予达里奥·佛或温斯顿·丘吉尔更令人震惊，他们两位也都没有写过多少作品。	The truth, however unpleasant it may be for the fuddy-duddies, is that awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature to an author who has written just one book is no more surprising than giving it to Dario Fo or Winston Churchill.
现在，形势已经清楚，近一半在6月8日的英国大选中投票的人受够了梅。 梅的保守党多数地位也在选举中消失殆尽，结果是形成了一个悬浮议会（任何政党都没能获得多数 ） 。	Now, it is clear, almost half of those who voted in the United Kingdom’s general election on June 8 have had enough of May, whose Conservative majority was wiped out at the polls, producing a hung parliament (with no majority for any party).
半个世纪前的法国，冷战一触即发之际，戴高乐很轻易地让法国人相信他们是二战中的英雄，因为他自己便是英雄。	In France half a century ago, as the Cold War loomed, Charles de Gaulle easily convinced the French that they were heroic during World War II because he was heroic.
结果，中东的下一个世纪要比过去的一个世纪苦难深重得多 — — 这一现实可能让我们相当怀念赛克斯和皮科的时代。	As a result, the Middle East stands to suffer far worse in the next century than it did in the last – a reality that could well leave us nostalgic for the times of Sykes and Picot.
事实上，世卫组织已经宣布使用实验性血清Zmapp合乎伦理 — — 这是一组混合基因工程抗体，旨在协助患者对抗埃博拉病毒。	In fact, the World Health Organization has already pronounced the use of the experimental serum ZMapp – a mixture of genetically engineered antibodies intended to help patients fight the disease – ethical.
氢氟碳化物也将成为今年11月即将在摩洛哥马拉喀什召开的下一届主要联合国气候变化会议COP22的核心议题。	HFCs will also be a central topic at the next major UN climate change conference, COP22, which convenes in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November.
因此，我们这些做出这样的预测的人 — — 用我的伯克利同事德隆（Brad DeLong）常说的话说，必须“按市场情况决定观点 ” 。	It is thus incumbent upon those who of us made such predictions to “mark our views to market,” as my Berkeley colleague Brad DeLong likes to say.
世界医学会的赫尔辛基宣言指出 ， “ 保护研究对象的责任必须始终跟随医生或其他医疗专业人士，决不可跟随研究对象”本身。	As the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki notes, “the responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health-care professional and never the research subjects” themselves.
这样做的目的是为了让欧洲在世界舞台上扮演一个强既有力又公平的角色，而不是一个不同观点共存的“大圣堂 ” 。	The purpose must be to establish Europe as a forceful and fair-minded player on the world stage, rather than as a “broad church” in which different viewpoints co-exist.
中国境内的外国直接投资2006年的头七个月在2005年下降了0.5%的基础上又下降了1.2 % ， 而来自日本、韩国和台湾的总体投资在2006年的上半年大幅下降了31 % ， 2005年则下降了6.5 % 。	China’s inward FDI fell 1.2% in the first seven months of 2006, after a 0.5% decline in 2005, while combined investment from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan plummeted 31% in the first half of 2006, compared to the 6.5% decline in 2005.
欧洲如果回绝这一挑战将会背叛其在格鲁吉亚的根本性义务。 实际上，拒绝支持格鲁吉亚奋斗中的民主将肯定推迟在乌克兰、白俄罗斯甚至是俄罗斯自身的民主进程。	Indeed, refusal to support Georgia’s struggling democracy would most likely postpone democratic progress in Ukraine, Belarus, even in Russia itself.
发自佛罗里达州劳德代尔堡 — — 发展中国家的持续高增长目标如今面临着多项重大障碍 — — 其中许多他们基本上是无力破除的。	FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA – Developing countries are facing major obstacles – many of which they have little to no control over – to achieving sustained high growth.
现在，德国基本上达到了充分就业，但工资增速并没有大大超过2 % ， 更不用说近30年前德国上一次出现如此低的失业率（不到4 % ） 时的工资增长率5%了。	Now Germany is practically at full employment, but wages are not increasing at much more than 2% – far lower than the 5% rate that prevailed when Germany last had such low unemployment (below 4%), nearly 30 years ago.
台湾也应当被允许在核安全方面参与国际原子能组织的活动，正如在1990年代SARS和禽流感肆虐期间被接纳成为世界卫生组织观察员那样。	Taiwan should also be allowed to participate in the International Atomic Energy Agency in the area of nuclear safety, just as it became an observer at the World Health Organization during the SARS and avian flu pandemics of the 1990’s.
这种爱的确非常严厉，不断攀升的借贷成本导致该地区经济快速收缩、大批民众失业（青年人的失业率高达50%以上）和财政状况持续恶化。	The love has been very tough indeed, generating rapid economic contraction, massive unemployment (upwards of 50% among young people), and continued fiscal deterioration, owing to rising debt-service costs.
尽管如此，这种方法不仅未能解决市场失灵，反而造成扭曲和效率低下的政府项目在中国所占比例高于高收入国家。	Still, the proportion of government programs that create distortions and inefficiencies, rather than address market failures, is higher in China than in high-income countries.
其次，民主需要约束（restraint）制度，如独立的司法和媒体，以保证言论自由等基本权利并防止政府滥用权力。	Second, democracy requires institutions of restraint, such as an independent judiciary and media, to uphold fundamental rights like freedom of speech and prevent governments from abusing their power.
20世纪80年代尼赫鲁外孙拉吉夫·甘地（Rajiv Gandhi）执政期间，印度逐渐取消了许多造成沉重负担的监管。	India slowly repealed many of these burdensome regulations in the 1980s, when Nehru’s grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, was in power.
一些西方企业家已经将这些所谓的“山寨”企业转变为 为它们的原型产品提供量产服务的企业，创造了一种跨境Kickstarter文化。	Some Western entrepreneurs already turn to these so-called Shan Zhai enterprises to manufacture their prototypes at scale, creating a kind of cross-border Kickstarter culture.
总而言之，欧洲长期受困于增长萎靡、主权债务过高 — — 当利率最终开始上升时，这将造成更加沉重的负担 — — 以及疲软低效的银行。	All told, Europe has long suffered from tepid growth, excessive sovereign debt – which will become more burdensome when interest rates finally rise – and weak, inefficient banks.
因此当突尼斯人权活动人士对王储近期的访问表示抗议时，许多阿拉伯活动家尽管强烈反对沙特领导人的行径，但却不得不克制自己以免遭到监禁。	So, while Tunisian human-rights activists protested MBS’s recent visit, many Arab activists had to refrain, despite strongly opposing the Saudi leader’s actions, in order to avoid imprisonment.
美国国会正在考虑，允许特朗普政府对参与该项目的欧洲公司实施制裁的立法，即使这些公司按照规定有责任履行合同义务。	The US Congress is considering legislation that allows the Trump administration to impose sanctions on European firms taking part in the project, even though these companies are contractually obliged to see the work through.
比如，美国联邦支出占GDP的比重在20世纪80年代中期至90年代末之间下降了5个百分点，在最近几十年的加拿大，支出-GDP比下降得更多 — — 都是在经济强劲增长期间发生的。	For example, federal spending relative to GDP fell by five percentage points from the mid-1980’s to the late 1990’s in the US, and by an even larger margin in recent decades in Canada – that is, through periods of strong economic growth.
更好的选择是IMF的特别提款权（Special Drawing Rights, SDR ） ， 它以美元、欧元、人民币、日元、及英镑一揽子货币为基础来计价。 根据IMF章程第二修订案，SDR应该成为世界“主要货币储备资产 ” 。	A better option is the IMF’s Special Drawing Right (SDR), which the second amendment of the body’s Articles of Agreement asserts should become the world’s “principle reserve asset.”
到2010年，北京、上海和天津的外来人口翻了一番以上，分别达到了34.5 % 、 37.9%和21 % 。	By 2010, the migrant population in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin had more than doubled, to 34.5%, 37.9%, and 21%, respectively.
当他连续两期登上《体育画报》的封面时，全世界也为之瞩目，也令致力于在中国树立品牌形象以及关注度的NBA大喜过望。	The whole world has taken note, with Lin being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated for two consecutive issues. The NBA, which has been trying to build brand recognition and interest in China, is thrilled.
对AKP的支持同时来自于全球化的赢家和输家，来自于保守的中部安纳托利亚和国际化的伊斯坦布尔，来自于民族主义的黑海地区和以库尔德人为主的西南部地区。	The AKP’s support came from both the winners and losers of globalization, from conservative middle Anatolia and cosmopolitan Istanbul, from the nationalist Black Sea region and the predominantly Kurdish Southeast.
为了赶上中国城市不断上升的生活成本，工人都开始要求更多的劳动补贴，比如广东本田汽车零部件厂那场引人注目的罢工事件就是其中一个例子，而争论的重点就在工资上面。	Workers are demanding higher compensation to match the fast-rising cost of living in China’s cities, as manifested in an ongoing and high-profile labor strike at a Honda plant based in Guangdong. Salary was the major point of contention.
随着个人和社会的富裕，他们彼此之间的联系也日益紧密 — — 既包括通过通信技术实现的虚拟联系，也包括通过人口增长、城市化和旅行实现的实体联系。	As individuals and societies become richer, they come into closer contact with one another – virtually, through communication technologies, and physically, through population growth, urbanization, and travel.
默克尔有力地宣布伊斯兰教也是德国的宗教，但一些东欧人宣称他们只欢迎少数难民 — — 并且必须是基督教徒。	Whereas Merkel declared forcefully that Islam was also a religion of Germany, some in Eastern Europe have declared that they will welcome only a small number of refugees – and only if they are Christian.
同时也能将其中一些短期问题，比如由种族以及语言多样化（该州目前分别有37%和13%的西班牙裔和亚裔人口）转化成全球经济的长期力量。	And it can turn some of its short-term problems, such as the pressures arising from ethnic and linguistic diversity (the state is now 37% Hispanic and 13% Asian) into long-term strengths in the global economy.
同时，河北省和其他东北三省正在经历经济衰退带来的不良后果，而同样曾是重工业主导的天津市、山东省和江苏省的经济却保持蓬勃发展势头。	Hebei and three other northeastern provinces are feeling the effects of recession, but the heavy-industry economies of Tianjin, Shandong, and Jiangsu are booming.
富国和穷国对谁应该为气候变化负责以及谁应该承担更大的代价而争论不休。 为了在2009年前达到目标，我们就必须超越目前这样的坐而论道。	To reach agreement by 2009, we must move beyond current generalities by which rich and poor countries argue about who should be blamed for climate change and who should pay the costs.
坚定的伊拉克领导人、三次连任总理的马利基也许没有采取足够的措施与伊拉克逊尼派接触，但这只是逊尼派激进化在伊拉克持久存在的一个原因。	The tough-minded Iraqi leader, Nouri al-Maliki, who won three terms as prime minister, may not have engaged in sufficient outreach to the country’s Sunnis, but that is only one reason why Sunni radicalism persists in Iraq.
更可怕的是，美国的舆论、媒体和大选结果，其实都纵容了一支拥有世界最强大军事力量却没有纪律的军队继续恣意妄为。	Worse still, America’s public opinion, media, and election results have left the world’s most powerful military without practical restraint.
但除了在推特上声称自己是一位“情绪非常稳定的天才外 ” ， 特朗普还能做些什么来证明自己在心理上适合担任这个在某种程度上全球最高的政府公职？	But, beyond claiming on Twitter that he is a “very stable genius,” what could Trump actually do to prove that he is psychologically fit for what, by some definitions, is the world’s highest office?
国会领导人脾气暴躁且贪赃枉法，毛泽东主义反政府动乱在九年时间内已经夺走12,000人的生命，大部分民众 已经不再抱有幻想。	Much of the public is disenchanted by the instability caused by fractious and corrupt parliamentary leaders and by the Maoist insurgency, which has cost 12,000 lives in nine years.
如果相关行动者没有致力于推进转型性技术，那么创新可能强化现状，并且通常是通过延长产品和系统的生命实现，而这些产品和系统并不适合社会的需要。	If the relevant actors are not working to champion transformative technologies, the results of innovation can reinforce the status quo, often by extending the life of products and systems that are not fit to address society’s needs.
虽然这些修复措施有助于防止欧元区崩溃，但它们还不足以确保货币联盟的长期抗冲击能力 — — 这一失策也导致欧元区在酝酿中的意大利危机面前束手无措。	Although these fixes helped to prevent the eurozone from collapsing, they were not enough to ensure the monetary union’s long-term resilience – a failing that has left the eurozone vulnerable to Italy’s brewing crisis.
卢拉在不引发通胀的前提下实现了上述所有目标，因为他知道 — — 这或许来自于他本人贫困的童年经历 — — 通胀带给穷人的灾难最为深重。	And Lula achieved all this without triggering inflation, which he knows – perhaps a result of his own impoverished childhood – wreaks havoc on the poor most of all.
民粹主义煽动者趁机大行其道 — — 他们承诺捍卫西方文明、抵抗伊斯兰教、与“布鲁塞尔”做���争、从左派精英手中“夺回”祖国。	That is why populist demagogues – with their promises to defend Western civilization against Islam, fight “Brussels,” and “take back” their countries from the leftist elites – have done so well.
这个问题已经变得更为严重，因为尽管朝鲜国内的报道并不完全可靠，但伴随最新核试的宣传暗示朝鲜是在测试一种武器设计，而不仅是一枚爆炸装置。	That question has become all the more acute because, though North Korean reports are not exactly reliable, the propaganda that accompanied the latest test hinted that the North was testing a weapon design, not just an explosive device.
这也需要对国际货币基金组织的章程作出一些调整，但是，那又怎么样呢？ 最近批准的改革已经需要对《国际货币基金组织协定》作出一些改变。	It could also require some adjustments to the Fund’s Charter, but so what? The recently approved reforms already require changes to the IMF’s “Articles of Agreement.”
但世行资金在满足这些国家的紧急需求方面也是捉襟见肘，并不得不对援助资金进行配额限制，使得其数额相对于原本所需的可靠而有效资金量而言只是杯水车薪。	But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries’ urgent needs, and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used.
这项政策源自于中央计划经济。 三十年前的计划经济导致了人为的低物价，并进而导致了基本必需品和关键生产要素，比如粮食和钢材的短缺。	The policy is rooted in central planning, which, three decades ago, led to artificially low prices and, in turn, to shortages of basic necessities and key production inputs, such as grain and steel.
20世纪30年代中的日本就是如此，当时的军事狂热分子发动了一场以失败告终的军事政变，打击那些在他们看来正在腐化日本政治的银行家、商人和政治家。	This was the case in Japan in the mid-1930s, when military hotheads staged a failed coup aimed at bankers, businessmen, and politicians who in their view were corrupting the Japanese polity.
简言之，欧盟发放补助时，人们趋之若骛；但一旦推行不受欢迎的改革，欧盟就成了政治、社会和经济弊政的替罪羔羊。	In short, when the EU brings subsidies, it receives congratulations; but when it pushes for unpopular reforms, it becomes the scapegoat for political, social, and economic failures.
如果习近平及其同事不能给出可信的政治改革承诺信号，那么一切都只是表面文章，而对其领导下的中国命运持悲观态度者将最终胜出。	If Xi and his colleagues produce no credible sign of such a commitment, everything else will be eyewash – and skepticism about China’s fate under their leadership eventually will be vindicated.
据说该实录堪称天皇起居注之典范，比如，它披露裕仁小时候欢庆圣诞节，年轻时鼻子动过手术等等，还记录了他与某人多么频繁地见面。	It is said to be an excellent chronicle of the court’s day-to-day goings-on, revealing, for example, that the emperor celebrated Christmas as a boy, that he had nose surgery in his youth, and how often he met with whom.
毕竟香港是世界上民众教育程度最高的地方之一：就人均水平而言，这里大概是除曼哈顿以外拥有最多世界前20名大学的毕业生的城市。	After all, Hong Kong has one of the world’s most educated populations: the city has, in per capita terms, perhaps more graduates of the world’s top 20 universities than anywhere outside of Manhattan.
对于南欧整体来，单一货币已被证明是一个金色的牢笼，一方面执行更为严苛的财政和货币政策，另一方面又剥夺了汇率这个抵受意外冲击的重要缓冲工具。	For southern Europe as a whole, the single currency has proved to be a golden cage, forcing greater fiscal and monetary rectitude but removing the exchange rate as a critical cushion against unexpected shocks.
我还向国际社会解释了将我们的政策建立在构建信任进程基础上的可信性和必要性，从而确保了许多国家的支持。	I have also explained to the international community the credibility and necessity of anchoring our policy in the trust-building process, securing support from many countries.
相反，他巧妙地忽略了赫鲁晓夫的威胁，而选择对一封证明这位苏联总理其实是位理性领导人，不过是想在世界事务中借谈判来寻求平等地位的书信做出反应。	Instead, he cleverly ignored Khrushchev’s threats, and instead responded to a letter that showed the Soviet premier as a rational leader negotiating for parity in world affairs.
但是，这一狭隘目标方法的一个后果是决策者无视资产和商品价格泡沫的形成，并忽略由此带来的银行部门不稳定。	But, as a consequence of this narrow approach, policymakers disregarded the formation of asset- and commodity-price bubbles, and overlooked the resulting banking-sector instability.
如果新型服务的雇佣关系和收入可以成功记录，这一改变就意味着可度量经济财富及产出的增加，因为GDP计算往往忽略不付费的家庭服务。	To the extent that employment and income in the new services can be easily recorded, this change implies an increase in measurable economic wealth and output, because unpaid household services are ignored in GDP calculations.
年轻人通常拥有较低的当前工资收入，但在未来收入方面增长较快，并适合透支未来收入以扩大当前消费并在教育方面投资。	The young normally face low, current wage income, but faster growth in future income, and would ideally borrow against future income to augment consumption today and to invest in education.
如果垄断实力提高，或企业（如银行）发展出更好的掠夺不同消费者的办法，就会表现出更高的利润，如果对此资本化，就表现出金融财富的增加。	If monopoly power increases, or firms (like banks) develop better methods of exploiting ordinary consumers, it will show up as higher profits and, when capitalized, as an increase in financial wealth.
但南欧劳动成本增速要快得多，这导致了成本增长速度差异，且这一差异不能被贬值修正，因为它们同处一个货币联盟。	But labor costs increased much faster in the south, resulting in differential cost increases that cannot be addressed by devaluation as long as the monetary union endures.
例如，2007—2008年全球金融危机就暴露了发达经济体中的腐败，既得利益集团为了确保他们的利益，乘机巩固了他们在立法和监管方面的影响力。	Consider the kind of corruption in advanced economies exposed by the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, in which vested interests secure the enactment of laws and regulations that entrench their own advantages.
美国通胀一直低于目标值，即使在今天，债券收益率仍表明人们对美联储是否有意愿或能力将物价增长稳步保持在官方水平2%表示深刻怀疑。	Inflation in the US has been consistently below target and, even today, bond yields reflect deep skepticism about whether the Fed has the will or the capacity to sustain price growth at the official 2% target on a consistent basis.
但这段历史说明1980年代真正的实际长期利率并不像我们所计算的那样高。 因为那时对长期通胀的期望值肯定比某一年份的通胀率要高得多。	But this history means that the true real long-term interest rate was not as high in the 1980’s as our measures show, because long-term inflation expectations must have been much higher than the one-year inflation rate was at the time.
柏林克罗依茨贝格区所谓“自治”的左翼暴力份子焚烧豪华轿车来自娱自乐，但德国却没有一扇银行窗户被砸破。	The so-called “autonomous” violent left-wing radicals in Berlin-Kreuzberg enjoy themselves by torching luxury cars, but not a single bank window has been smashed in Germany.
但真正重要的却是在议会中占据的席位，而不是赢得选票的比例，因为英国实行以单议席选区为基础的赢家通吃的选举制度，这种制度鼓励政党奉行中间主义的政策。	However, seats in parliament, not percentages of the vote are what matters, owing to Britain’s winner-take-all electoral system based on single-member constituencies, which encourages political parties to gravitate to the center.
但《第六修正案》却��不适用于关塔纳摩的囚犯，因为他们不是美国公民，并且被关押在从技术上讲并非位于美国领土的设施里，虽然这一设施完全在美国政府的控制之下。	But the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the Guantánamo prisoners, because they are not US citizens and are in a facility that, technically, is not part of US territory, although it is under the full control of the US government.
现实是，欧盟可以因为其处理危机的方式而被批评；但你不能指责它造成了助长2008年以来的经济灾难的全球经济失衡。	The reality is that the EU can be criticized for the way it handled the crisis; but it cannot be blamed for the global economic imbalances that have fueled economic strife since 2008.
几乎没有信号表明2015年会迎来任何改善，因此决策者的明智做法也许是弄清楚全球经济表现持续萎靡的根本因素 — — 以及继续如此下去的影响。	With few signs that this year will bring any improvement, policymakers would be wise to understand the factors underlying the global economy’s anemic performance – and the implications of continued feebleness.
一个抢占先机的戏剧性方法是利用日本战后建立的现有和平计划，就亚洲防务和安全问题提出一项包容性计划提案。	One dramatic way to seize the initiative would be to build on Japan’s existing initiatives in post-conflict peace-building with a proposal for an inclusive plan for Asia’s defense and security.
而极右翼的国民阵线（National Front，其领导人玛丽娜·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）在总统竞选中败给了马克龙 ， ） 在第一轮选举中的支持率下降到只有13.2 % 。	And backing for the far-right National Front, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, lost to Macron in the presidential election, fell to a mere 13.2% in the first round.
尽管我们可能不知道最近的科技创新能给我们的福利形成多大贡献，但我们至少知道它们不是代表危机前全球经济的金融创新，它们的效果至少是正数。	Although we may not know how much recent technological innovations are contributing to our wellbeing, at least we know that, unlike the wave of financial innovations that marked the pre-crisis global economy, the effect is positive.
而后在2018年2月，卡马最先打破非洲领导人的沉默，呼吁民主刚果共和国专制总统约瑟夫·卡比拉“交权 。 ”	Then, in February 2018, Khama broke the silence among African leaders and called for Joseph Kabila, the autocratic president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, to “relinquish power.”
通过锡安主义 — — 从本质上说，这是一种世俗民族主义运动 — — 犹太人回归了政治活动，并发展出必要的外交工具。	It was through Zionism, an essentially secular nationalist movement, that the Jews were returned to political action and developed the necessary diplomatic tools.
最近各市政府和州立法机关之间就围绕法律优先适用原则展开了几场法律斗争 — — 该原则认为地方法律应服从于州法律。	There have been several legal fights recently between city governments and state legislatures over the principle of preemption, which holds that state laws override local laws.
但与此同时，我们又不能允许将科学等同于实际应用，因为这样就破坏了科学和科学家们的思想地位，从而妨碍科学对自然现象做出解释。	But, at the same time, we won’t allow science to be reduced to practical utility, because that would destroy its intellectual status, as well as the intellectual status of scientists themselves, and would prevent science from giving explanations.
特朗普的胜选相当于给12个国家的跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）敲响了丧钟，而TPP是奥巴马亚洲战略的核心。	Trump’s victory has sounded a death knell for the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Obama had made the centerpiece of his Asia strategy.
并且发展中国家前景黯淡；比如，预计到2030年，NCD导致非洲人死亡的数量将超过传染、母婴和营养性疾病之和。	And the outlook for developing countries is dire; for example, by 2030, NCDs are expected to cause more deaths in Africa than communicable, maternal, and nutritional illnesses combined.

In West and Central Africa, only 2.1 million of the 6.1 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy.
但狂躁抑郁症和精神分裂症都属于精神病范畴，其特征是患者无法控制自身行为和思想，其发作具有周期性，发作时患者不能被视为拥有自由意志的行为人。	Both manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia are psychotic conditions, characterized by the patient’s loss of control over his or her actions and thoughts, a recurrent state in which s/he cannot be considered an agent with free will.
比如，斯里兰卡MAS控股集团（MAS Holdings）在工作场所中嵌入了护士站、现场银行服务以及解决雇员上下班问题、方便他们参与体育活动的通勤巴士。	For example, MAS Holdings in Sri Lanka has incorporated into the workplace nursing stations, on-site banking, and company buses that ease employees’ commutes and facilitate participation in sports programs.

在美国，五角大楼宣称陆军教官“动辄大吼的情况更少了 ” ， 因为新新一代对“更多扮演导师角色”的教官反应更好。	In the United States, the Pentagon says that Army drillmasters do “less shouting at everyone,” because today’s generation responds better to instructors who play “a more counseling-type role.”
ACS的雇员还仅仅是第一批从全球经济最热门的趋势中获益的非洲人。 这一趋势就是外包，换言之就是将服务性工作从高收入国家向低收入国家转移。	ACS's employees are but the first Africans to benefit from the hottest trend in the global economy: outsourcing, or the shift of service jobs from high-wage to low-wage countries.
如果能够更多地关注国内在获得水、住所或工作方面巨大的不平等现象，这些人也许不会选择暴力作为寻求改变的方式。	Had more attention been given to the country’s most glaring inequalities in access to water, shelter, or jobs, this population might not have chosen violence as an instrument of change.
作为占收入的份额，它在第10百分位上的70 ％ ， 大幅下降至顶端的-16 ％ （ 换句话说，顶端收入人群支付的税额比它收到的政府补助金更多 ） 。	As a share of income, it declines sharply from 70% at the 10th percentile to -16% at the top (in other words, the top bracket pays more in taxes than it receives in government benefits).
而俄国人正好相反，他们继续强调包括军事力量在内的“硬实力 ” ， 因为他们明白：自己身处一个危机四伏的世界之中，且没有靠山可供求助。	Russians, on the other hand, emphasize their “hard power,” including military force, because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind.
关于区域公共物品的论坛和对话也可以证明是有价值的，因为它们可以促进对包括流行病，自然灾害和环境退化等跨边界挑战的合作。	Forums and dialogues on regional public goods could also prove valuable by promoting cooperation on cross-border challenges, including epidemics, natural disasters, and environmental degradation.
在沿海的安得拉邦，哥本哈根共识中心最近与印度最古老的慈善机构塔塔信托（Tata Trusts）一起寻找解决该邦最大挑战的政策选择。	In the coastal state of Andhra Pradesh, the Copenhagen Consensus Center recently collaborated with Tata Trusts, one of India’s oldest philanthropies, to identify the best policy options for solving the state’s biggest challenges.

显然，美国队古巴的严厉制裁并没有导致卡斯特罗政权倒闭；事实上，奥巴马总统转而与古巴重建完全外交关系倒有可能效果更好。	Certainly, severe US sanctions on Cuba failed to bring the Castro regime to heel; indeed, President Barack Obama’s move to reestablish full diplomatic relations may have more effect.
事实上，当时出现的银行贷款高速增长令中国的M2（衡量货币供应的广义数值）大幅飙升，从2008年相当于GDP的150%上升到如今的约200 % （ 超过100万亿人民币 ） 。	Indeed, the surge in bank loans caused China’s M2 (a broad measure of the money supply) to soar, from 150% of GDP in 2008 to some 200%, or more than CN¥100 trillion, today.
我们能够减轻儿童权利的剥夺、增加机会平等，从而为更公正、更繁荣的未来 — — 反映我们所公开追求的价值的未来 — — 打下基础。	We can reduce childhood deprivation and increase equality of opportunity, thereby laying the groundwork for a more just and prosperous future – one that reflects our own avowed values.

马格里斯的小说不仅是文学上的重大成就，它与我们当今所面临的危险有着深层次的联系，特别是从孟买到奥斯陆打着与“异端”圣战名义的狂热主义。	Magris’s novel is not only an important literary achievement; it also has a deep connection to the dangers that we face now, particularly the wave of fanaticism, from Mumbai to Oslo, in the name of a holy war against the “other.”
非洲是移动银行的先锋，M-Pesa等本地公司和花旗银行等跨国公司证明了新技术可以为无法接触到银行的人口提供至关重要的金融服务。	Africa has pioneered the use of mobile banking, with local players like M-Pesa and global corporations like Citi demonstrating how new technology can provide vital financial services to the unbanked population.
今年，奥哈尼安在德克萨斯州奥斯汀市的西南偏南互动节（SXSW Interactive Festival）发表了主旨演讲，其中并未谈及言论自由和仇恨言论之间的界限。	When Ohanian delivered a keynote address at the popular SXSW Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, this year, he didn’t talk about the line between free speech and hate speech.
毕竟，欲使一国债务/GDP比率在没有紧缩的情况下出现下降，该国对其债务所支付的利率就必须低于GDP增长率。	After all, if a country’s debt/GDP ratio is to decline without austerity, the interest rate that it pays on its debt must be lower than its GDP growth rate.
为了在比索大幅贬值后稳定汇率，阿根廷不得不将利率提高到40 % ， 同时寻求国际货币基金组织的帮助。	To stabilize its currency at a much-depreciated rate, Argentina had to jack up interest rates to 40% and seek help from the International Monetary Fund.
实际上这个王国对整个事件的反应 — — 正如其长期以来的对内对内外政策一样 — — 都集中在“稳定”上。	In reality, the Kingdom’s response is centered, as its foreign and domestic policy has long been, on “stability.”
香港民众，尤其是年轻人，目前的激进态势反应了改变现状的愿望，他们希望中方为不履行“自治”承诺和用镇压来回应不同意见付出代价。	The current radicalization of Hong Kong citizens, particularly its young people, reflects a desire to change that, and make China pay a price for reneging on its promise of “self-rule” and responding to dissent with repression.

几十年来，全球卫生界对于不平等的权力关系 — — 特别是在性别上 — — 在决定健康成效方面所扮演的关键角色一直都是嘴上说说而已。	For decades, the global health community has paid lip service to the critical role of unequal power relations, particularly relating to gender, in determining health outcomes.
但正如中国单方面肆无忌惮地在亚洲主张陆上和海上领土权利，它也在利用改变跨境界河流向和拒绝传输水文数据来深化其地区力量。	But just as China has unilaterally and aggressively asserted its territorial and maritime claims in Asia, it is using the reengineering of cross-border riparian flows and denial of hydrological data to deepen its regional power.
到目前为止，资本比例要求尚未被降低，尽管相关部门的特朗普提名人选提出了其他去监管化措施，并已在落实。	So far, the ratios have not been cut, though other deregulatory initiatives, proposed by Trump appointees in the relevant agencies, are in the works.
为保障我们未来的繁荣，我们必须问自己，新技术设计究竟是为满足社会需要，抑或仅仅是为变而变的无意之举。	To ensure the future prosperity of the Middle East, its governments and citizens must ask themselves if new technologies are being designed and adapted to meet real social needs, or if they are simply ushering in change for its own sake.
此外，从务实的角度看，美中之间频繁的定期高层军事交流能显著增进互信，否则的话，两国之间的利益分歧可能会导致冲突。	And, on a practical level, frequent and regular high-level military exchanges between the US and China would greatly increase mutual confidence and trust at a time when their divergent interests might otherwise lead to conflict.
自2000年以来中国向非洲那些局势不稳和实施独裁的国家大献殷勤：一方面利用援助，另一方面承诺可以阻止联合国对这些国家实施制裁。	Since 2000, China has actively courted Africa’s unstable and dictatorial countries with offers of aid and a refusal to back United Nations sanctions against them.
尽管进口替代和补贴在点燃工业化方面一开始取得了一些成功，但规模的欠缺很快就形成了掣肘（一个只有几百万人口的国家是不可能拥有只面向国内市场的汽车业的 ） 。	Though import substitution and subsidies were initially successful in igniting industrialization, lack of scale soon hindered efforts (a country of a few million cannot hope to have an auto industry aimed only at the domestic market).
这意味着要去帮助他们评估和降低需要绿色基础设施的新区域和部门的风险，并与当地战略投资基金和绿色银行妥善合作。	This means helping them to assess and mitigate risk in new regions and sectors where green infrastructure is needed, if appropriate in cooperation with local strategic investment funds and green banks.

而六国 — — 全都是美国的传统盟友 — — 则向特朗普总统提供了相关数据，希望证明贸易对所有国家都非常有利	The rest of the G7 – all traditional US allies – confronted President Donald Trump with data that they hoped would prove that trade had been highly beneficial to all countries.
低通胀给过于友好的货币政策造成了虚假的安全感，导致资产和信用市场出现大量泡沫，从而引起实体经济的大扭曲。	Drawing false comfort from low inflation, overly accommodative monetary policies have led to massive bubbles in asset and credit markets, resulting in major distortions in real economies.
极少有英国选民了解欧盟委员会实际的工作方式或欧洲理事会的作用，但多数却对英国独自对抗希特勒、或者被移民“淹没”的未来前景很有感觉。	Very few British voters have a clue about how the European Commission actually works, or the role of the European Council, but most have some feeling about Britain standing alone against Hitler, or the prospect of being “swamped” by immigrants.
唯有承认这是一个不正常（dysfunctional）的结构，因为它让欧盟机构和成员国可以一直通过互相指责来规避责任 — — 他们才能够去追求必须的再平衡。	Only after they recognize that this is a dysfunctional structure – because it allows both the EU institutions and member states to skirt responsibility by constantly pointing fingers at one another – can they pursue the needed rebalancing.
没有工作的年轻人在日后的生活中的机会也更少 — — 这是对教育和技能的浪费，对国民经济造成消极影响。	Young people who are unemployed have fewer opportunities later in life – representing a waste of education and skills that has a detrimental effect on national economies.
例如《大西洋月刊》2017年5月号刊登的一篇文章就写到 ： “ 随着2015年圣诞节的临近，南瓜派香料的价格变得有点不可理喻 … … 亚马逊网站上一盎司罐装的价格可能是4.49美元，也可能是8.99美元，而完全这取决于你是在什么时候浏览的。 “	For example, a May 2017 article in The Atlantic notes that, “As Christmas approached in 2015, the price of pumpkin-pie spice went wild. … Amazon’s price for a one-ounce jar was either $4.49 or $8.99, depending on when you looked.”
随着全球化的发展，通信变得更加快速，旅行变得更加便捷，跨国公司变得愈发强大，一个新的、国际性的社会阶层开始涌现。	As globalization proceeds, with the help of ever-faster communications, faster travel, and more powerful multinational corporations, a new, cosmopolitan social class seems to be emerging.
我们中的一个目前正在四处藏匿，因为缅甸的军政府用暴力和凶残来镇压我们信仰佛教的兄弟姐妹的和平抗议活动。	One of us is in hiding today, because Burma’s military government met the peaceful protests of our Buddhist brothers and sisters with violence and brutality.
此外，在欧洲的南方近邻，即地中海地区，新风险正在北非和撒哈拉地区迅猛崛起，包括基地组织对马里北部的威胁。	And, to Europe’s immediate south, across the Mediterranean, new risks are emerging in the vastness of North Africa and the Sahara, including the threat of an Al Qaeda state in northern Mali.
德国总理安格拉·默克尔在东德的成长经历应该使其对普京专制思想具备特别敏锐的洞察力 — — 她把俄国领导人的所作所为形容为权力政治指导下的脱离现实之举。	German Chancellor Angela Merkel – whose East German upbringing should have given her especially acute insight into Putin’s authoritarian mindset – has described the Russian leader as detached from reality, guided by nineteenth-century Machtpolitik.
在首次以总理身份接受采访时，莫拉维茨基告诉持极右翼观点的玛利亚广播电台他打算“重新实现欧洲基督化 ” 。	In his first interview as prime minister, Morawiecki told the far-right broadcaster Radio Maryja that he plans to “re-Christianize Europe.”
据我们所知，昆德拉在这起事件之前或之后从未做过告密者，并且我们不能忘记的是他后来从共产主义所散布的强制的极权主义幸福中逃离了出来。	As far as we know, Kundera never was an informer before or after this incident, and we cannot ignore that he later freed himself from the compulsory totalitarian happiness that communism propagated.
没有一个国家够资格称得上完全的自由民主，即结合了自由公平的选举和宪法对全体公民个人权利的保护的政治制度。	No country qualifies as a full liberal democracy – that is, as a political system that combines free and fair elections with constitutional protections of individual rights for all its citizens.
这意味着不利用今天的机会在巴勒斯坦领土上兴建或扩建定居点，内塔尼亚胡政府似乎已决意执行扩建定居点计划。	That means not exploiting today’s opportunity to build more settlements on Palestinian land, or to expand existing ones, as Binyamin Netanyahu’s government appears determined to do.
但共和党的策略长期以来一直是宣称气候根本没有变化，或变化与人类和他们的汽车、工厂和发电厂没有任何关系。	But the Republican strategy has long been to claim that the climate is not changing or that any change has nothing to do with people and their cars, factories, and power plants.
许多人甚至认为他们的投入会在个人资本账户中逐渐累积，他们并不知道这些钱其实还用于给目前的养老金享受者提供资金。	Many even believe that their contributions accrue to an individual, capitalized, account, rather than financing the benefits paid to current pensioners.

那位博主虽然对《华盛顿邮报》对桑托勒姆虚构荷兰故事的批驳嗤之以鼻，但他自己的表达方式也正如一个完美的后现代主义者。	The blogger who dismissed The Washington Post’s corrections of Santorum’s fictional portrayal of the Netherlands expressed himself like a perfect post-modernist.
如果得到专业的管理，这笔巨大的商业资产组合的收益不但能为急需的基础设施投资提供资金，也能为其他一切有需求的公共品和服务提供资金。	If professionally managed, the yield from such a vast portfolio of commercial assets could fund not just critically needed infrastructure investments, but also any other public goods and services that are in demand.
在喀麦隆，不少我们的组织与世界海关组织一道，帮助海关当局减少了腐败、增加了收入，据估算，每年可以增收2500万美元。	In Cameroon, some of our organizations have worked with the World Customs Organization to help the customs authority reduce corruption and increase collection of revenues – estimated to be more than $25 million a year.
较少被关注到 — — 因为政治性不那么明显 — — 的是如今的思想碰撞，在这方面，法国经济学家托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）的《二十一世纪资本论 》 （ Capital in the Twenty-First Century）便是这一问题的最新明证。	Less noticed, because less obviously political, are today’s intellectual rumblings, of which French economist Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century, a withering indictment of growing inequality, is the latest manifestation.
2016年的一项研究调查了1,000所文科院校，结果发现只有18%将美国历史或政府课程列为学位必修课程。	A 2016 survey of 1,000 liberal arts colleges found that only 18% required a US history or government course to earn a degree.

也没人知道被热议的“创新产业”是否能够形成与昔日的房地产投资和出口等量齐观的影响力 — — 因为传统行业的产能过剩情况实在太严重了。	And no one knows whether the much-discussed “innovative industries” can have the impact that real-estate investment and exports did – not least because there is so much excess capacity in the traditional industries.
尤其是中国在经济上所取得的令人震惊的成功似乎表明存在着将自由、民主、法治以及市场经济捆绑在一起的西方观念可行的极权主义替代物。	In particular, China’s breathtaking economic success seems to point to the existence of viable authoritarian alternatives to the Western idea that freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and the market economy are bound together.
而在1988年开始推行经济改革至1995年建立越美外交关系期间，越南的年均增长率达到了5.6 % ， 而后又以4.5%的速度快速增长。	Vietnam, however, grew at an annual rate of 5.6% per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, and has continued to grow at a rapid 4.5% pace since then.
可以肯定，世界媒体仍然感到困惑；这份由路透社新闻研究所编写的报告显示，仅44%的新闻消费者相信知名媒体品牌所发布的内容。	To be sure, the world’s media remain troubled; the report, produced by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, shows that only 44% of news consumers believe what established media brands publish.
事实上，就像许多叙利亚人所担心的那样，将阿萨德赶下台却没有想明白由谁来继任有可能为某种极端“逊尼斯坦”的出现铺平道路。	In fact, as many Syrians rightly fear, removing Assad without a clear idea of what comes next could pave the way for the emergence of a kind of radical “Sunni-stan.”
随着年龄的增长，我们的身体会发生复杂的变化，后果之一是我们对感染作出反应并产生免疫的能力会逐渐削弱（人们将这称之为免疫衰老 ） 。	As we age, our bodies undergo complex changes that, among other things, progressively weaken our ability to respond to infections and develop immunity (this is called immunosenescence).
今年的报告关注焦点是工作的性质：我们讨生活的方式如何被经济全球化、新科技和社会组织方面的创新所改变。	This year’s report focuses on the nature of work: how the way we earn a living is being transformed by economic globalization, new technologies, and innovations in social organization.
哪怕暴力相关开支只减少10%也能省下4，730亿美元，并实现4，730亿美元的产出增长 — — 这些资金可以用于基础设施、医疗保健或教育服务。	Reducing violence-related expenditure by even 10% would save $473 billion, while contributing to output growth worth an additional $473 billion – money that could be channeled toward infrastructure, health care, or educational services.
他在尚未确定能拨乱反正时说 ， “ 这场起义是来自上帝的礼物，因为这将是清洗我们的军队的理由 。 ”	As he put it while it was still unclear if he was going to emerge on top, “this uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army.”
很显然，某些文化有其特有的表达方式和说话语气，因此Digital Mirror也分析其测量值出现的相对和绝对频率。	Obviously, some cultures have their own jargon and tone, so Digital Mirror looks at the relative as well as absolute frequency of the values that it measures.
这个问题可以迅速得到解决；那就是消除低效并重新定位那些由旧体系指派的，服务于少数人而不是多数人的机构则可以显著增加潜在产出。	This could be addressed promptly; while eliminating inefficiencies and re-orienting institutions that were co-opted by the old system to serve the few rather than the many would increase potential output significantly.
土耳其不仅在经济活力和快速增长等意义上越来越靠近“亚洲 ” ， 它的亚洲化还具有更多的政治意义，实行某种形式的“东方专制主义”越来越有诱惑力。	Turkey is not “Asian” only in terms of economic energy and rapid growth: it is also Asian in a more political sense, with the rising temptation of a form of “Oriental despotism.”
即使在20世纪90年代和21世纪的第一个十年的大部分时间里，每年都有10—20%的国家经历过货币大幅贬值或崩溃。	Even through much of the 1990s and early 2000s, 10-20% of countries worldwide experienced a large currency depreciation or crash in any given year.

尽管有一些春天的萌芽，但我们还是应该为下一个黑暗的冬天做好准备：是时候实施第二套银行重组的方案了，也是时候再打一剂凯恩斯主义的强心针了。	In spite of some spring sprouts, we should prepare for another dark winter: it’s time for Plan B in bank restructuring and another dose of Keynesian medicine.
其过去两年在黎巴嫩和目前在加沙地带的军事冒险，根本没有巩固以色列的安全，而是造成了进一步的自我孤立并失去了世界的同情。	Far from reinforcing Israel’s security, its last two military adventures, in Lebanon and now in Gaza, have caused further self-isolation and loss of world sympathy.
基础设施投资和经济改革对地中海地区的进一步发展无疑至关重要，但如果不同时关注民主、法治、人权和教育，就无法为地区带来变化。	Infrastructural investment and economic reform are crucial for the Mediterranean region’s future development, but they cannot transform the region without a parallel emphasis on democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and education.
奥巴马扩大美国对非洲农民支持的全新优先政策表明美国已机敏地认识到农业领域的拓展能够如何迅速地帮助众多非洲农民脱贫致富。	Obama’s one new priority – to expand US support for African farmers – reflects a shrewd appreciation of how the expansion of agriculture can quickly lift many rural Africans out of poverty.
几年后，弗里德曼的“自然”率被换成了更少价值判断，但更冠冕堂皇的“非加速通胀型失业率 ” （ NAIRU ） 。	A few years later, Friedman’s “natural” rate was replaced with the less value-laden and more erudite-sounding “non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment” (NAIRU).
如果这种分析是正确的，我们应该赶紧包一列欧洲之星列车，把银行家们绑个结实然后把车厢封死以防他们在到达英吉利海峡隧道之前跳车，最后把他们送到巴黎去。	If that analysis is correct, we should be packing bankers off to Paris in specially chartered Eurostar trains, sealed to prevent them from attempting to jump off before they reach the Channel Tunnel.
事实上如果目前的发展轨迹无法得到减缓或逆转，到2050年时每年会有1000万人可能死于抗药性疾病，导致全球经济损失100万亿美元。	In fact, if the current trajectory is not slowed or reversed, by 2050 some ten million people could succumb to drug-resistant diseases every year, costing the global economy $100 trillion.

在一个货币联盟内部，只有两种方法来消除国家之间的竞争力差距：从比较有竞争力的地方转移财富到竞争力较低之处，或者实施内部贬值 — — 这意味着削减实际工资。	In a monetary union, there are only two ways to close a competitiveness gap between countries: transfers from the more competitive to the less competitive, or internal devaluation, which means real wage cuts.
伦敦巴克莱银行（Barclays Bank）计算了26个国家的CAPE市盈率（我为巴克莱的CAPE市盈率相关产品提供顾问 ） 。	Barclays Bank in London compiles the CAPE ratios for 26 countries (I consult for Barclays on its products related to the CAPE ratio).
这样的表态是1992年雅尔塔协定的组成部分，该协定划分了黑海舰队，要求俄罗斯必须承认乌克兰领土完整才能允许其舰队继续履行塞瓦斯托波尔的1997年租赁合同。	Such recognition was part of the 1992 Yalta Agreement, which divided the Black Sea fleet, and of the 1997 leasing contract that allowed the fleet to remain in Sevastopol.
目前主要靠燃烧煤炭和天然气来发电；这些热电企业需要被逐步淘汰，并以利用太阳能、风能、水电、核能以及其他非碳能源发电的电力企业来实现替代。	Today’s electricity is largely generated by burning coal and natural gas; these thermal power plants need to be phased out and replaced by electricity generated by solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, and other non-carbon sources.
奥运会的举办可能会提高中国在全球的威望。 毫无疑问，会组织得很完美，不会看到抗议者、无家可归者、持不同信仰者或任何其他类型的扫兴者。	The Olympic Games – no doubt perfectly organized, without a protester, homeless person, religious dissenter, or any other kind of spoilsport in sight – will probably bolster China’s global prestige.
尽管随着危机趋于缓和，经常可以听到去杠杆化的说法，但实际上，发达经济体私人部门的负债率仍然居高不下。	While there is much talk about de-leveraging as the crisis wanes, the reality is that private-sector debt ratios have stabilized at very high levels.
欧洲外交机构欧洲对外行动局（European External Action Service，EEAS）是一个巨大的官僚机构，要想让它具有效率，就必须进行很好的管理。	Europe’s foreign service, the European External Action Service (EEAS), is a huge bureaucracy, which must be managed well if it is to be effective.
因为伊朗和沙特两国以及它们在叙利亚的代理人依旧在如何解决冲突的问题上相持不下；土耳其正在打一场本国对库尔德人的战争；逊尼派反对势力仍旧不愿妥协。	Iran and Saudi Arabia, with their proxies on the ground, remain at loggerheads over how to resolve the conflict; Turkey is engaged in its own war against the Kurds; and the Sunni opposition remains unwilling to compromise.
因此大萧条并未给未来增长留下阴影，或者说，大萧条的阴影被为对抗纳粹德国和日本帝国的总体战而动员起来的5年现代化所发出的强光一扫而空。	As a result, the Depression did not cast a shadow on future growth – or, rather, the shadow was overwhelmed by the blinding floodlights of five years of mobilization for total war against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.
由于过渡委员会无法管束下属武装人员，这类暴力行为必将随着士兵和武装分子撤离卡扎菲重要据点而日渐增多。	With the NTC unable to impose discipline on its soldiers, such violence is likely to increase as army soldiers and militias evacuate Qaddafi strongholds.
此外，欧盟的东欧新成员国既没有经济实力也没有长期成员国那样的政治上的稳定，它们现在的情况开始急剧恶化。	Moreover, the new EU member states in Eastern Europe, which have neither the economic strength nor the political stability of long-term members, are now beginning to take a nosedive.

事实上，Ngrams书籍搜索表明“社团主义”一词直到20世纪30年代中期以后才开始流行，成为热点则是在20世纪七八十年代。	In fact, an Ngrams search of books shows that the term corporatism began to become popular only after the mid-1930s, and achieved broad currency by the 1970s and 1980s.
但在欧盟扩大的进程中划一条界线不但会使欧盟错失良机，对于那些位于巴尔干和其它地区的国家而言也是一种残酷的打击。	When the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government launched its policy of Greek-Turkish rapprochement during my tenure as foreign minister, many people were suspicious of mending ties with an old enemy.
国会可能会破坏支撑其平台的整个崇高目标列表 — — 包括单一付款人医疗保险、为所有人免费提供大学教育、改革竞选融资和分拆大银行 — — 将其斥之为代价无法承受，甚至“不符合美国精神 ” 。	Congress probably would have derailed the entire list of noble goals that comprised his platform – single-payer health care, free college for all, campaign-finance reform, and breaking up big banks – as unbearably costly, if not “un-American.”
因此消除蚊子传播的疾病当属首要任务，不仅仅要求政府实施有效组织管理，还要民间社会，私营部门和受影响社区的参与。	Eradicating mosquito-transmitted diseases must therefore be a top priority, eliciting not just effective government stewardship, but also the involvement of civil society, private-sector engagement, and the participation of affected communities.
每当我们给出优先权的时候，我们说的不仅仅是我们应该在哪些（好的）方面做得更多，也应该指出在哪些（有争议的）方面我们不必再追加努力。	Whenever we prioritize, we not only say where we should do more (which is good) but also where we should not increase our efforts (which is regarded as cynical).
这6.9%的平均年回报率已经被认为是“Siegel衡量 ” ， 就好像Siegel发现了自然新规律一样。	This 6.9% annual average return has since been referred to as “Siegel’s constant,” as if Siegel had discovered a new law of nature.
但我们也认识到，发展中国家也有责任采取行动，同时这样做可以为本国民众带来巨大的经济，社会和公共卫生利益。	But we also recognize that developing countries have a responsibility to act and that doing so can generate immense economic, social, and public health advantages for their citizens.
这也是为什么破产法庭和集体行动条款（CAC）试图对所有债券持有者，包括那些潜在的不合作者，强制执行多数有资质债权人接受的协议。	That is why bankruptcy courts and bonds with collective-action clauses (CACs) seek to impose on all bondholders, including potential holdouts, agreements accepted by a qualified majority of creditors.
一位总统或一名首相可以很容易地忽略掉一千个网站；而更荒谬的是，网络传播渠道和声音的多样性却反而削弱了媒体监督政治领导人履行其义务的能力。	It is easy for a president or prime minister to ignore a thousand Web sites; the multiplicity of outlets and voices online, paradoxically, has weakened the media’s power to force accountability from leaders.
首先，SDR’s代表着流动性并且只有在存在“全球需求”时才能被分配。 而就现在具有高度流动性和“容易”的国际资本市场的情况来看，要证明这种需求的存在是困难的。	Above all, SDR’s represent liquidity and can be allocated only if and when there is a “global need,” which would currently be difficult to prove given highly liquid and “easy” international capital-market conditions.
在这种情况下，除非各国政府迅速向金融机构注资，随着损失增加的速度快于再资本化的速度以及银行被迫紧缩信用和贷款，信用紧缩将变得更加严重。	Thus, unless governments rapidly recapitalize financial institutions, the credit crunch will become even more severe as losses mount faster than recapitalization and banks are forced to contract credit and lending.
具体而言，日本的年人均GDP增长率在1960年代平均达8.6 ％ ， 随后在1970~80年代快速下降到3~4 ％ ； 韩国的GDP增长率从1970~80年代的年均7~8％下跌到2000年的4 ％ ； 中国持续三十年之久的两位数增长在2010年走到了尽头，目前年均增长不足7 ％ 。	Specifically, Japan’s annual per capita GDP growth averaged 8.6% in the 1960s, before plummeting to 3-4% in the 1970s and 1980s. South Korea’s GDP growth dropped from 7-8% in the 1970s and 1980s to 4% in the 2000s.
经济模型显示像多哈回合多边贸易谈判所预期的成功削减贸易壁垒到2030年可能增加11万亿美元的全球GDP收入。	Economic models show that a successful reduction of trade barriers like that foreseen in the ongoing Doha Round of multilateral trade talks could add $11 trillion to global GDP by 2030.
无论如何，这个词是说给美国人听的，美国人习惯于发动决定性速决战（自越战以来这就是美军所坚持的方针 ） ， 为事关存亡的战争作出长期牺牲和奋斗。	Above all, the term was an effort to communicate to Americans, accustomed to waging war with speed and decisiveness (and insistent on it since Vietnam), the long-term sacrifice and commitment needed to win a war of survival.
抑制回购市场是划算的，因为这种融资手段已被证明是不稳定的：贝尔斯登和雷曼兄弟都极度依赖回购协议，以至于它们无法接受其他业务上的投资被撤销的冲击。	Dampening the repo market could be economically useful, because this funding has proven to be unstable: Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers used repo heavily in ways that made them unable to withstand investment reversals elsewhere in their business.
不仅如此，伊朗主要的阿拉伯盟国叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德已经得到了喘息之机，而叙利亚冲突则一拖再拖没有结果。	Moreover, Iran’s main Arab ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been given a reprieve as the conflict in his country drags on without conclusion.
对主要发达经济体来说，五年前的金融危机标志着债务融资国内消费长时期的终结，这一时期的基础是来自不可持续的资产价格高估的财富效应。	For major advanced economies, the financial crisis five years ago marked the end of a prolonged period of debt-financed domestic consumption, based on wealth effects derived from unsustainable asset-price overvaluation.
全球基金的首两次持续捐款会议本周将在斯德哥尔摩举行，旨在为2006-2007的拨款任务确定经济担保，以及填补今天的款额缺口。	The first of two replenishment conferences for the Global Fund is taking place this week in Stockholm, with the aim of securing financial pledges to cover grant commitments in 2006-2007, as well as to fill the gap for this year.
商品和服务税 — — 一种政府已经取得意中进展的增值税 — — 的实施将是一项重大成就，也是对经济的巨大提振。	The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax – a form of value-added tax on which the government has made admirable progress – would be a major accomplishment and a huge boost for the economy.
强硬路线在阿富汗、伊拉克、利比亚和叙利亚造成了冲突扩大，导致大量死亡，却没有为受影响国家带来有意义的政治或经济解决方案。	Hardline approaches brought expanded conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, leading to plenty of deaths but not to meaningful political or economic solutions in the affected countries.
在盖茨基金会，我花了很多时间用于理解各种女性和女孩推动发展前进的方式：投资于孩子的营养、基本健康和教育 — — 以及提供农场劳动力。	At the Gates Foundation, I spend a lot of my time understanding the many ways that women and girls drive development forward: by investing in their children’s nutrition, basic health, and education – and also by providing farm labor.
对于一些人来说这不禁让人联想起毛泽东当年近乎封神的地位，但他在“大跃进”和“文化大革命”期间令数千万人丧命，还几乎摧毁了中国经济。	For some, this is all too reminiscent of the quasi-divine status attributed to Mao Zedong which, during the “Great Leap Forward” and “Cultural Revolution” resulted in millions of deaths and nearly destroyed the Chinese economy.
随着经济金融危机日趋频繁和深重，群众革命、社会主义和共产主义的威胁也日益严峻，于是，作为（市场经济自由民主国家）的一种对策，社会福利国家崛起了。	Thus, the rise of the social-welfare state was a response (often of market-oriented liberal democracies) to the threat of popular revolutions, socialism, and communism as the frequency and severity of economic and financial crises increased.
听起来似乎与直觉相反，第二个可以作为世贸组织复兴之福的发展态势是越来越多的选民开始拒绝超全球化（hyper-globalization ） 。	However counterintuitive that may sound, a second development that bodes well for the WTO’s revival is voters’ increasing rejection of hyper-globalization.
防止取消抵押品收回权的救济计划起步则更加迟缓。 该计划可能碰到很多困难，比如怎样在不造成拖欠大幅增加的情况下重做拖欠的抵押贷款。	The foreclosure relief plan is off to an even slower start, and is likely to run into numerous problems concerning how to rework delinquent mortgages without inducing a lot more delinquencies.
她指出，聚焦于资产价格忽略了美联储货币政策在维持增长、从而遏制全面萧条风险方面的作用，而这有助于所有收入阶层。	She argues that focusing on asset prices ignores the role – helpful for all income groups – of the Fed’s monetary policy in maintaining growth and thus warding off the threat of a wholesale depression.
鲁汶大学经济学家多克尔及其同事一直致力于研究发展中国家移民对东道国预算、工资和消费市场所产生的影响。	The University of Louvain economist Frédéric Docquier and his colleagues have been researching the economic impact that immigrants from developing countries have on host-country budgets, wages, and consumer markets.
于是，如今我们有一套全球计划，并且还有来自美国、英国、法国的各种国内方案作为补充，欧洲也有可能出台不同于其他地区的计划。	So we now have a global plan, of sorts, supplemented by various home-grown solutions in the US, the UK, and France, with the possibility of a European plan that would also differ from the others.
根据生计保险计划，如果被保险人所在职业和地区的平均收入指数大幅度下降，那么私有保险人就将持续向保单持有人支付收入流。	With livelihood insurance, a private insurer would pay a stream of income to a policyholder if an index of average income in the insured person’s occupation and region declines substantially.
独立当局 — — 如欧盟委员会，甚至建立一个全新的机构 — — 需要确保节约下来的资金被用于各国的生产性用途。	And independent authorities – such as the European Commission or even an entirely new institution – would need to ensure that savings were put to productive use in each country.
马哈蒂尔和安瓦尔之间的个人冲突就这样演变成了马来西亚伊斯兰派政治力量与马来民族统一机构改革者之间显而易见的裂痕。	The personal conflict between Mahathir and Anwar thus led to an apparent rupture between Malaysia’s Islamist political forces and the modernizers of UMNO.
毕竟，过去造成的投资短缺必须得到弥补，与此同时，还要进行面向未来的投资，因此当下的一代就不得不背负起双重负担。	After all, past investment shortfalls have to be made up and future-oriented investments undertaken simultaneously – a double burden that must be borne by the current generation.
不顾上述问题的“美国第一”政策 — — 无论是在柬埔寨还是在其他国家 — — 最后只会让美国的实力不断削弱。	An “America First” approach that disregards these issues – in Cambodia or elsewhere – will only leave the US weaker in the end.
对此，土耳其的解释是欧盟没有履行自己的承诺（因为尼科西亚的希腊族塞浦路斯政府投了否决票 ） ， 开放与土耳其人控制下的北塞浦路斯的贸易。	Turkey explains its refusal by the EU’s failure (as a result of a veto by the Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia) to fulfill its own promise to open up trade with Northern Cyprus, which is under Turkish rule.
可以通过手机操作的移动支付和数字钱包消除了在农村地区携带实体现金的需要。 由于金融服务的缺乏，在非洲农村地区携带大笔现金是很危险的。	Mobile money and digital wallets accessed on cellphones eliminate the need for physical cash in rural areas, where financial services are limited and carrying large amounts of cash is risky.
而布什政府却正向伊拉克增派21000名美国士兵，并敦促盟国增兵阿富汗。 美国的盟友们正抵制其中东政策。	Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq, and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America’s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy.
对他们来说，被周围的人们认出来没有问题，甚至是很他们一直渴望的事，但被电脑识别出来就有点令人不寒而栗且不开心了。	For them, recognition from people may be okay – even desirable – but recognition by computers is creepy and unfulfilling.
在没有监管机构的事先规划和实时建议以及国际协作的情况下，法庭无法胜任这些任务，特别是在现有银行破产准备时间内 — — 48小时周末。	The courts cannot fulfill these tasks, especially not in the time currently allotted for a bank bankruptcy – a 48-hour weekend – without regulators’ prior planning and immediate advice, as well as international coordination.
约有2，000万穆斯林，多数是逊尼派，在俄罗斯联邦境内生活，据该国安全官员报告，来自前苏联加盟共和国和俄罗斯的大约7，000名武装人员已经加入了伊斯兰国。	Around 20 million Muslims, most of them Sunni, live within the Russian Federation, and the country’s security officials report that some 7,000 fighters from the former Soviet republics and Russia have joined the Islamic State.
相反，世界银行的领导人应当在一个公开和透明的程序中做出选择，这一程序的目的在于挑选最为称职的候选人，而无论其来自美国、欧洲抑或是发展中世界。	Instead, the Bank’s head should be chosen in an open and transparent process that aims to select the best-qualified candidate, whether from the US, Europe, or the developing world.
在大部分社会 — — 包括美国社会 — — 公开表达这类观点受到什么可以被社会尊重这一粗略共识的限制。	In most societies, including the US, the public expression of such opinions is limited by a rough consensus on what is socially respectable.
中国和印度在美国都有庞大的海外社区，中国为240万，印度为170万。 和其他美国人一样，他们对于各自的祖国越发关注。	Large expatriate communities in the US – 2.4 million Chinese and 1.7 million Indians – have increased interest in their home countries among other Americans.
事实上，PiS政府正在试图改写波兰的二战叙事 — — 而不再是小声嘀咕 — — 它制定了一项新法律，规定说“波兰民族”是大屠杀共犯的行为是犯罪。	In fact, the PiS government is attempting to reshape Poland’s WWII narrative – and not in a whisper – with a new law criminalizing mention of the complicity of the “Polish nation” in the crimes of the Holocaust.
当代经济学家依赖机械法则去理解 — — 以及影响 — — 经济结果的状况也延伸到了宏观经济政策方面，并经常利用政权来行事。 在此约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）一定会对他们的做法表示反对。	Contemporary economists’ reliance on mechanical rules to understand – and influence – economic outcomes extends to macroeconomic policy as well, and often draws on an authority, John Maynard Keynes, who would have rejected their approach.
但多数人的看法不仅错误，而且危险，因为我们都知道错误的看法能快速生根，扭曲事实，而后像水泥一样固化。	The conventional wisdom is, however, wrong; worse, it is dangerous, for we have all seen how quickly it can take hold, distort reality, and then harden like cement.
（针对正在形成的威胁的）预防性的打击和（针对迫在眉睫的威胁的）先发制人的打击都是在法律和外交上存在争议的选项，因此提出容易实施难。	The legally and diplomatically controversial options of preventive strikes (against a gathering threat) and preemptive strikes (against an imminent threat) make them easier to propose than to implement.
作为这种倾向的一个例子，罗默援引了芝加哥大学经济学家罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）的工作。 他在2009年的论文《思想和增长 》 （ Ideas and Growth）中认为，书本或蓝图在促进增长中毫无用处。	As an example of this tendency, Romer cites the work of the University of Chicago economist Robert Lucas, who, in his 2009 paper “Ideas and Growth,” dismisses the role that books or blueprints can play in driving growth.
奥巴马的连任表明，拉丁裔选民的选票力量十分强大，他们以3比1的绝对多数反对共和党候选人罗姆尼，亚裔也是如此。	But Barack Obama’s re-election demonstrated the electoral power of Latino voters, who rejected Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney by a 3-1 majority, as did Asian-Americans.
这个手稿言简意赅地总结了你整个的物竞天择理论。 他还请求，如果你认为他的观点有理，作为一个在科学界交游广泛的人士，你能否把他的论文推荐到伦敦林奈学会供人评议甚至出版。	He’s asking you, as a well-connected man of science, whether you would communicate his paper to the Linnean Society of London for reading and possible publication, if you think his arguments meritorious.
不仅如此，近2/3的非洲农田土壤缺少关键营养元素，而且很多农民缺乏恢复土地肥力的资源和技术知识，导致他们无法充分利用新技术。	Moreover, almost two-thirds of African farmland soil is missing key nutrients, and many farmers lack the technical knowledge and resources to restore their land’s fertility, leaving them unable to take full advantage of new technologies.
只要欧洲人一天没有看到自身生活水平的改善，他们就将继续倾向于民粹主义，而这生活水平改善只能靠更高生产率增长来实现。	Europeans will continue to gravitate toward populism if they do not see improvements in their standard of living, which will happen only with higher productivity growth.
就连默克尔所在的基督教民主联盟（Christian Democratic Union）的姊妹政党、巴伐利亚基督社会联盟（Christian Social Union）在难民问题上也是态度冷淡。	Even the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, has proved a reluctant partner in this area.
由洛克菲勒基金会召集、现已征集到300多个签名的《经济学家宣言 》 （ Economists’ Declaration）背后的更广泛的动力将全球卫生与发展推向了一个历史十字路口。	And the broader impetus behind this Economists’ Declaration, convened by The Rockefeller Foundation and now with more than 300 signatures, has placed global health and development at a historic crossroads.
人们原先认为计算能力的提高将改进基因治疗的针对性，因为它使我们能根据个体之间的差异安排从基因治疗到处方用药的所有过程。	The original idea was that greater computing capacity would enable particularized therapies, because we could now turn our attention to individual differences in everything from gene therapy to the delivery of pharmaceuticals.
对桑托斯来说，在复杂的国内政治环境中协调和平与正义要求他另辟蹊径，比如缩短刑期、社区惩罚、有条件判决或流��第三国等。	For Santos, reconciling peace and justice in a complicated domestic political context may require alternative formulas, such as reduced sentences, community penalties, conditional verdicts, or asylum in third countries.
而如果实力就是确保实现某些人制定的目标的能力，也必须牢记有时实力会在与他人合作（而非施加于他人之上）时变得更加强大。	If power is the ability to obtain the outcomes one wants, it is important to remember that sometimes our power is greater when we act with others rather than merely over others.
法国和希腊的最新大选，以及意大利的地方选举和西班牙和爱尔兰没完没了的政坛乱象表明，公众已经对德国人强加在他们头上的严厉紧缩失去了信任。	The recent elections in France and Greece, together with local elections in Italy and continuing unrest in Spain and Ireland, have shown that the public has lost faith in the strict austerity forced upon them by Germany.
发自慕尼黑 — — 在持续的外部压力之下，那些遭到危机侵袭的欧元区国家终于放弃了长期以来的抵抗，开始忍痛削减财政预算。	MUNICH – Under substantial external pressure, the eurozone’s crisis-hit countries are, at long last, bringing themselves to make painful cuts in their government budgets.
同时，ISP们应该实施一种EMAIL ID系统（目前有两个好的方法：Domain Keys和SPF ） ， 这倒不是追踪用户的邮件，而是为了防范坏人作恶。	At the same time, all ISPs should implement an e-mail ID system (there are two good standards, called Domain Keys and SPF). This is not to track everyone’s mail, but to prevent bad guys from spoofing good guys.
2012年，中国与日本就钓鱼岛（由日方在1895年首先控制）的领土纠纷再起，中国再次利用贸易作为战略武器，让日本付出了几十亿美元的代价。	In 2012, after China’s sovereignty dispute with Japan over the Senkaku Islands (which the Japanese first controlled in 1895) flared anew, China once again used trade as a strategic weapon, costing Japan billions of dollars.
在1999年对绑架16名欧洲人的也门人进行审判时，证据显示该团伙的头目在绑架过程中曾经致电阿赫玛尔。	During a 1999 trial of Yemenis convicted of kidnapping 16 Europeans, it emerged that the group’s ringleader called al-Ahmar during the ordeal.
因此欧洲重建与开发银行呼吁所有尚未采用欧元的新成员国立刻开始行动，起草可靠而令人信服的计划来申请加入欧元区。	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development therefore encourages all new EU member states that have not yet started doing so to draft credible and convincing plans for euro-zone admission.
习近平也许比特朗普聪明得多（特朗普并不是一个难以清除的障碍 ） ， 但这并不足以保证中国能获得稳定繁荣的未来。	Xi may be much smarter than Trump (not a high hurdle to clear), but that is not enough to guarantee a stable and prosperous future for China.
但是，一份从出生跟踪到38岁的最新研究发现，很早就开始使用大麻且每天使用维持多年者会造成智商评分下降8分，且这一影响是永久的。	However, a recent study that followed people from birth to age 38 found that those who started using cannabis early, every day, and for several years had a permanent 8-point drop in IQ scores.
此外，许多技术创新没有转化为更高的生产率增长，结构改革速度仍然缓慢，漫长的周期性停滞侵蚀着实体资本的技能基础。	Moreover, many technological innovations have not translated into higher productivity growth, the pace of structural reforms remains slow, and protracted cyclical stagnation has eroded the skills base and that of physical capital.
提供基础存款和贷款便利的平台应归类为银行，它们的交易包括信用、流动性和交易风险，应通过基于风险的资本要求等措施进行审慎监督。	Platforms that offer basic deposit and loan facilities should be classified as banks, whose transactions entail credit, liquidity, and trading risks that merit prudential supervision alongside measures like risk-based capital requirements.
惟其如此，我们才能建立一个保护互联网的跨国性质、保护人权、打击滥用，并维持真正的全球数字经济的框架。	Only then can we create a framework to preserve the cross-border nature of the Internet, protect human rights, fight abuse, and sustain a truly global digital economy.
因为歉收、惠及保险机构而非负债农民的失败的农作物保险计划以及对灌溉、信贷、价格支持和其他必要投入所给予的关注不足，印度现在面对创记录的农民自杀人数。	With harvest failures, failed crop-insurance schemes that benefited insurers rather than indebted farmers, and inadequate attention to irrigation, credit, price-support, and other needed inputs, farmer suicides have risen to record levels.
但如今市值最大的四家美国公司 — — 苹果、谷歌，微软和亚马逊 — — 都是科技企业（截至撰写本文时伯克希尔哈撒韦公司超越脸书排到了第五位 ） 。	But now, the four largest US firms by market capitalization – Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon – are all tech companies (as of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway had edged out Facebook for fifth place).
世贸组织在21世纪初达到顶峰，当是时，全球贸易谈判乌拉圭回合刚刚在几年前结束，更多的国家 — — 最引人注目的是中国 — — 答应加入该组织。	The WTO reached its peak in the early 2000s, a few years after the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations concluded, and a time when more countries – most notably China – were acceding to the organization.
并且被拯救的大多是儿童，而即使在发展中国家，他们的预期寿命也至少有50岁，换算下来拯救一年性命的成本只有68美元。	Given that most of the lives saved are those of children, who even in developing countries have a life expectancy of at least 50 years, this equates to a cost of $68 per year of life saved.
总体来说，那些表现较好的新兴经济体（比如印度）已经将健康的增长基本面和改革与务实积极的措施结合起来对抗外部波动。	Generally, those that have fared better, such as India, have combined sound growth fundamentals and reforms with pragmatic and activist measures to counter the external sources of volatility.
如果中美无法对美国日益膨胀的贸易赤字找到有效共赢的解决方案，而美国又坚持认为中国有责任，那今天在知识产权上可以取得的进展也将是明日黄花。	If the US and China can’t find common ground on how to address the ballooning US trade deficit, progress on the big issues of today may become irrelevant tomorrow.
一个互联的能源系统对英国和德国尤其有用，因为两国可以利用互相之间的一小时时差去抹平本国能源需求的高峰和低谷。	An interconnected energy system would make particular sense for the UK and Germany, which could use the one-hour time difference between them to smooth out the peaks and troughs in demand.
该系统已经可以联络卫星、雷达和拦截设备共同防御导弹袭击，而这种能力将在未来几年内变得愈加复杂和灵活。	The system already can connect satellites, radars, and interceptors to defend against missile attacks, and that capability will grow more complex and agile in the years ahead.
而让真相如此难以忽视的原因则在于避免灾难性的气候变化将要求人们去改变自己的生活方式，甚至在某些情况下放弃自己的心爱之物（比如大排量汽车 ） 。	What made the truth inconvenient is that avoiding catastrophic climate change would require people to live differently and, in some cases, give up what they love (such as gas-guzzling cars).
为此联合国秘书长潘基文特别成立了全球气候变化金融问题高级咨询小组，并任命为笔者为召集人，专门就发达国家如何在2020年前筹集这笔巨资这个问题寻求实用方案。	United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s High-level Advisory Group on Climate Finance (AGF), which we chaired, was established to identify practical proposals for how developed countries can mobilize this level of climate financing by 2020.
如果美国国债真的已不如过去那样信誉卓著，那么在8月2日奥巴马总统和国会就提高政府债务上限问题达成一致的时候，美国国债应该更加值得怀疑。	If America’s debts had truly become less trustworthy, they would have been even more dubious before the agreement reached on August 2 by Congress and President Barack Obama to raise the government’s debt ceiling.
本周，日本央行在其会议后并未宣布任何政策变化，违背了货币状况进一步大幅宽松政策的普遍预期，令外界大感意外。	This week, the BOJ surprised markets by making no policy change at its meeting, contrary to the widespread expectation of a significant further easing of monetary conditions.
光靠自由市场无法解决“外部性 ” — —当经济活动产生了有害后果，但这种后果又不会给个别生产商和消费者造成直接成本时，就会产生外部性。	Free markets alone cannot cope with the “externalities” that arise when economic activities produce harmful consequences that impose no direct cost on individual producers and consumers.
运用邓小平所描述的“摸着石头过河”的思路，通过试验、适应与演进，中国正在成功摸索一个更高层次的供应链 — — 政治决策供应链 。	Through experimentation, adaptation, and evolution – a process that has been described as “crossing the river by feeling the stones” – China has been able to evolve a higher-order, or fifth, supply chain in political decision-making.
当时，重大银行及金融危机导致产出骤减（与金本位制崩溃相联系 ） ， 美国和欧洲的税收锐减，政府试图通过削减预算开支限制预算赤字。	When output crumbled due to a profound banking and financial crisis (linked to the collapse of the gold standard), tax revenues plummeted in the US and Europe, and conservative governments tried to cut budget spending to limit budget deficits.
北京和上海的规模和活力几乎势不可挡，到处是闪闪发光的摩天大楼，装饰着闪亮的霓虹灯，日益国际化的民众更是随处可见。	Beijing and Shanghai are almost overwhelming in their scale and energy, lined with shimmering skyscrapers, adorned with bright neon lights, and teeming with increasingly cosmopolitan citizens.
12月初，他来到拉合尔，十天后，他在该市独立纪念塔广场的大型公众集会上发表了演讲。 一年前，板球运动员出身的政客的伊姆兰·汗（Imran Khan）在这里掀起了一场他称之为（尽管有些用词不当）政治海啸的风波。	Ten days later, he addressed a mammoth public meeting at the city’s Minar-e-Pakistan grounds, where, a year earlier, the cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan had launched what he not very appropriately termed a political tsunami.
比如，他在竞选时头戴红色棒球帽，高举“让美国再次伟大”的口号，又比如他在经商时对于品牌建设的执着，当然还有他对推特的使用。	Consider his campaign’s red baseball cap with the slogan “Make America Great Again,” as well as his fixation on branding when he was a businessman, and his use of Twitter.
更明智的宏观经济政策带来了更快的GDP增长。 这需要经济扶植，刺激一些内部操纵者放弃那些可能会吓跑潜在外部投资商的有害策略。	Better macroeconomic policy led to faster GDP growth, which required financing and motivated some insiders to forego pernicious maneuvering that would scare away new outside investors.
事实上相较于1980年代非洲只有3个民主国家的尴尬境况，如今已经有超过20个非洲国家实现了民主政治。	Today, more than 20 African countries are democracies, up from just three in the 1980’s.
第二种解释是所谓的“选型交配 ” ： 那些成就卓越的成功男士不会再娶他们的秘书为妻，而是选择同样成绩斐然的职业女性。	The second explanation is what is called “assortative mating,” according to which highly accomplished professional men no longer marry their secretaries, but instead choose highly accomplished professional women.
存款有国家担保，因此银行应该是安全又无趣的，再考虑到其他一些必要性，应该把风险活动分离出来组成另外一类公司 — — 逻辑上，这再自然不过了。	It is only logical that banks with state-guaranteed deposits should be safe and boring, with other necessary, but risky activities hived off to separate companies.
因此，完全有理由展望一些欧盟成员国在打击犯罪，反恐，国防或财政以及预算协调等领域将朝着这一方向迈进。	There is reason to hope that some of the EU’s member states will embark on this venture in fighting crime and terrorism, defense matters, or in financial and budgetary harmonization.
于是更佳的偿还前景和更低的资本监管成本将助长以资产为基础的融资行为，帮助其进一步取得更多资产 。 。	Better repayment prospects and lower regulatory capital costs then fuel the asset-based financing of further acquisition of assets.
而且，时任社会主义党总理的若斯潘在2002年的总统选举中被极右翼政党民族阵线候选人庞勒淘汰出局一事也被广泛理解为表明了社会党的亲欧立场，而我却认为这种说法并不正确。	Moreover, Lionel Jospin’s elimination from the presidential election in 2002 by the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen is widely interpreted – wrongly in my opinion – as the result of the Socialists’ pro-European position.
在启动SDG之前，7月的发展融资会议（Conference on Financing for Development）将有机会为教育SDG找到真正的资源。	In advance of adopting the SDGs, at the Conference on Financing for Development in July, the world has the chance to put real resources behind the Education SDG.
庞德科沃（Gillo Pontecorvo）1966年的经典电影《阿尔及尔之战 》 （ The Battle of Algiers）道出了殖民势力面临的两难。	Gillo Pontecorvo’s brilliant 1966 film The Battle of Algiers spelled out the dilemma for the occupying colonial power.

对此有一种解决方案正日渐流行，而且听上去似乎也合情合理，那就是全世界必须大幅削减每天的温室气体排放量。	One prescription that is bandied about with increasing frequency certainly sounds sensible: the world should drastically cut the amount of greenhouse gases that it pumps into the atmosphere each day.
就在半个世纪以前，当我于哈佛大学开始自己的中国研究生涯之时，中国还在实行社会主义计划经济制度，这种制度把人民生活的方方面面都严密控制了起来，并得到了中国领导人对其优越性的大肆宣扬。	When I first began studying China at Harvard a half-century ago, China’s leaders trumpeted the superiority of their socialist command economy, which controlled every aspect of life.
当经济考量与一套制度的规则冲突时，决策者必须要么找出创新方法修改规则，要么眼睁睁看着他们创造出来的东西轰然倒塌。	When economics clashes with an institution’s rules, policymakers must either find creative ways to amend the rules or watch their creation collapse.
特朗普的话语特别悲剧 — — 也许也是最恶毒 — — 的影响是他让许多美国人将自己视为白人民族主义运动的一部分。	The particular tragedy of Trump’s rhetoric – and, arguably, its most pernicious effect – is that he has convinced many Americans to view themselves as part of a white nationalist movement.
国际货币基金组织（IMF）的最新世界经济展望预测今年全球增长为3.5 % ， 较去年的3.2%有所提高。	The International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook predicts 3.5% global growth this year, up from 3.2% last year.

没有可行的办法监管一切政府行为，但我们确实希望 — — 为了我们自己，也为了告密者 — — 拥有诉诸法律的权利和在我们（或其他人）可能做错时说出来的权利。	There is no sensible way to regulate all government behavior, but we do want – for ourselves and for whistleblowers – the right to legal recourse and to speak out if we (or someone else) may have been wronged.
自我担任高盛公司首席经济学家以来，我一直关注全世界的六个指标，它们一起构成未来六个月全球经济动向的可靠指南。	Since my days as Chief Economist at Goldman Sachs, I have kept an eye on six indicators from around the world that, taken together, provide a reliable snapshot of what the global economy will look like for the next six months.
有些人在步入中年或此后，会发现自己已被世界上其它地方更为廉价的劳动力替代（如果不是被电脑或机器人替代的话 ） ， 对这些人，我们仍然抱有同情，这点毫无疑问。	To be sure, we still sympathize with people who, upon reaching middle age or later, find themselves replaced by lower-paid workers in another part of the world, if not by a computer or a robot.
剧本也许还没有杀青，但剧情已经泄露无疑：这一回与2009年哥本哈根谈判失败的结局不同，地球将获得胜利。	The script may still be under wraps, but the plot has already leaked: This time, in sharp contrast to the failed negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009, the planet is going to win.
一系列立法 — — 将共享音乐等多种互联网使用行为入罪以及允许更大程度的政府监控 — — 似乎在逆自由潮流而动。	A wave of legislation – criminalizing various types of Internet use, such as music sharing, and allowing greater government surveillance – appeared to be turning back the liberal tide.
平心而论，2008年全球金融危机后，欧盟确实制定了一个宏观经济失衡程序（Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure，MIP ） ， 对盈余超过GDP的6 % ， 或赤字超过GDP的4%的欧元区国家课以罚款。	To be sure, after the 2008 global financial crisis, the European Union did establish a Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure to fine eurozone countries with surpluses exceeding 6% of GDP or deficits exceeding 4% of GDP.
出于所有这些原因，贯穿二十世纪第三个四分之一的稳定和可预测性的全球时代似乎戛然而止，随之而来的是一个不确定性突出的时期。	For all these reasons, the golden age of stability and predictability that was the third quarter of the twentieth century seemed to have abruptly drawn to a close, to be succeeded by a period of greatly heightened uncertainty.
仔细分析新监管措施是否真的需要，以及在需要的情况下预估并用规则填补监管空白以确保储蓄平稳流向新建和已有项目很重要。	It is important to analyze carefully whether the new regulations are actually needed and, if yes, to foresee and fill regulatory gaps with rules that ensure the smooth flow of savings to new and existing projects.
就算在高优先级的国防部门内，可能也有三分之一的政府开支被浪费或贪污 — — 这种情况决不利于俄罗斯实现其极大的权力野心。	Even in the high-priority defense sector, perhaps one-third of government spending is wasted or stolen – a condition that is not conducive to realizing Russia’s great power ambitions.
欧洲建构已近60年，却仍然未能创造出任何近似单一投资市场的体系，同时许多欧盟国家的资本市场依然处于贫弱不发达状态。	Almost 60 years of European construction had still not created anything approaching a single market for investment, and in many EU countries capital markets remained weak and underdeveloped.
一如既往地，在其2012年9月名为《联盟之国 》 （ State of the Union）的演讲中，欧盟委员会主席巴罗佐呼吁加强欧盟委员会的权力。	True to form, in his “State of the Union” address to the European Parliament in September 2012, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso called for a more powerful Commission.
第一，即便特洛芬在这些实验中更有疗效，但这种药只是为了满足美国和欧洲市场的需求，永远不会在非洲销售。	First, even if the trials proved favorable, Trovan was never intended for sale in Africa, but rather for the US and European markets.
最大的两党基本上都由胜任并一致的领导层领导，代表着相对合理的政策立场 — — 保守党中右翼和工党中左翼。	The two largest parties largely operated under competent and consistent leadership and represented relatively well-defined policy stances – center-right for the Conservatives, and center-left for Labour.
类似地，老式“政府干预 ” — —比如“选择赢家”措施、打造国家“冠军 ” ， 或通过国家补贴让失败的商业模式继续生存 — — 既充满了危害，也不可能成功。	Similarly, old-fashioned dirigisme – such as attempts to “pick winners,” foster national “champions,” or keep failed business models alive through state subsidies – is both harmful and doomed to fail.
随着水灾及旱灾等极端天气事件在撒哈拉以南非洲地区变得越来越普遍，气候变化正在导致上述投资变得更为必要。	Climate change is making such investments even more urgent, as extreme weather events – both flooding and droughts – are becoming more common throughout Sub-Saharan Africa.
现任州长杰瑞·布朗（此人曾于1970年代担任州长）接手的是一笔历届政府积累下来的总额达260亿美元的财政赤字，这还是在大规模支出公共雇员养老金和医疗支出之前的数字。	Governor Jerry Brown (who was also Governor in the 1970’s) inherits a budget deficit of $26 billion. And that’s before the coming deluge from generous public employee pensions and health costs.
通过散播恐惧和憎恨 ， ” 他说 ， “ 他们想要让难民在欧洲集中，切断他们与欧洲社会的联系，让他们成为欧洲仇外主义的受害者。	By spreading fear and loathing,” he says, “they wish to ghettoize refugees in Europe, to cut them off from European societies, to make them victims of European xenophobia.
问题不在于中国经济有多强劲，而在于中国滥用自由贸易规则，补贴出口并阻碍进口，以保护国内工业和就业岗位。	The problem isn’t that China has a strong economy, but rather that it abuses free-trade rules to subsidize its exports and impede imports, in order to shield domestic jobs and industry.

对于哈马斯来说，巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿巴斯也只不过是个“过渡人物 ” ， 因此最终也会连同其世俗的巴勒斯坦解放组织一道，在一场迈向伊斯兰社会的革命中彻底滚蛋。	For Hamas, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is a “transitional figure,” to be swept away together with his secular PLO in the revolutionary drive to an Islamic society.

像萨尔玛·海耶克、罗斯·麦高恩和瑞茜·威瑟斯彭这样的明星愿意分享她们遭性侵的故事鼓励了来自各行各业的女性分享自己的遭遇。	The willingness of celebrities like Salma Hayek, Rose McGowan, and Reese Witherspoon to share their stories of sexual harassment empowered women from many walks of life to speak out, too.
同时应加强对临床试验的管理，以使它成为一个全球性的公共数据库，提供各种临床试验方案，发布定期更新的试验进展状况。	Tighter regulation of all clinical trials is needed, as is a public worldwide database that contains trial protocols and regularly updated information about trial status and publications.
换句话说，中国的未来 — — 以及全球经济的未来 — — 取决于中国领导人有多大决心克服既得利益、追求全面的结构性和政策改革。	In other words, China’s future – and that of the global economy – depends on how committed its leaders are to overcoming vested interests and pursuing comprehensive structural and policy reform.
而欧洲央行将继续提供纸币，同时也将促进一个综合，创新和竞争性的欧元区零售支付解决方案市场的进一步发展。	The ECB will continue to provide banknotes. We will also facilitate the further development of an integrated, innovative, and competitive market for retail payment solutions in the eurozone.
政府还建立了自由贸易区（低关税、降低海关壁垒并减少行政干预 ） ， 试图以此加强市场在资源配置中的决定性作用。	With the creation of free-trade zones – which entail lower tariffs, reduced customs barriers, and less administrative intervention – the government is attempting to give market forces a decisive role in resource allocation.
到2007年，就连叙利亚经济事务副总理兼（2011年被内战打断的）经济改革总设计师阿卜杜拉·达尔达里也将拉卡形容为长期被遗忘的城市。	By 2007, even Abdullah Dardari, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs and a chief architect of Syria’s economic reforms (which were upended by the 2011 civil war), described Raqqa as a long-forgotten city.
相反，克林顿支持者应该聚焦于用新方法吸引特朗普支持者的兴趣，同时坚决捍卫感到受到特朗普日程威胁的少数人的权利。	Instead, Clinton supporters ought to focus on new ways to appeal to the interests of Trump supporters, while resolutely defending the rights of minorities who feel threatened by Trump’s agenda.

“里斯本战略”的成形在很大程度上要归功于奥地利经济学家Joseph Schumpeter，他的理念是利润源自创新。	The Lisbon Strategy owes much to the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, who claimed that profit results from innovation.
在世界领导人齐聚奥斯陆举行峰会的同时，数百万家长在为确保他们的孩子获得应该获得的教育而发愁 — — 这些教育能让他们为自己和家庭赢得更好的生活。	As world leaders gather in Oslo, millions of parents will be struggling to ensure that their children receive the education they deserve – one that will enable them to build better lives for themselves and their families.
事实上，世界经济论坛的最新版《世界风险评估报告 》 （ World Risk Assessment Report）将不能适应气候变化的影响列为全球社会和经济面临的最大的风险（以影响衡量 ） 。	In fact, the latest edition of the World Economic Forum’s World Risk Assessment Report names failure to adapt to the effects of climate change as the single greatest risk, in terms of impact, to societies and economies around the world.
欧洲需要更加团结，这不仅是为了战胜危机、完成欧元区一体化进程；也是为了弥合欧洲及其民族之间的日益扩大的分歧。	Europe needs more solidarity not only to overcome the crisis and complete the eurozone integration process, but also to bridge the widening divide between Europe and its peoples.
罗伯特·舒曼（Robert Schuman）在构思欧共体时承诺，一体化阻止了德国和法国之间再次爆发战争。	As Robert Schuman promised when he conceived the idea of a European Community, integration has prevented the recurrence of war between Germany and France.
现在美国不再是一个没有战略性挑战者的“超级强权 ” ， 因此俄国再一次宣扬其作为“超级大国”地位，而这一宣称并非与事实相符。	Now that America is no longer a “hyperpower” with no strategic challengers, Russia has reasserted its status as a “superpower,” a claim that is not necessarily supported by reality.
华盛顿—越来越多的证据表明，不平等性正在世界诸多国家加剧，这一问题也随之引起了学者和政客的越来越多的关注。	WASHINGTON, DC – As evidence mounts that income inequality is increasing in many parts of the world, the problem has received growing attention from academics and policymakers.
奥尔班是个独裁者，通过指责移民和欧盟来驾驭国内盛行的后共产主义幻灭感，尽管匈牙利经济还得依赖于单一市场以及来自布鲁塞尔的补贴。	Orbán is an autocrat who exploits popular disillusion with post-communism by blaming immigrants and the EU, even though the Hungarian economy depends on the single market and subsidies from Brussels.
毕竟，许多人都一直在传播“高效市场假设 ” 。 这一假设认为，全球的金融市场变得极为富有竞争性，乃至从投资中获得超过正常的回报是不可能的。	After all, many people here have been teaching the “efficient markets hypothesis” that financial markets around the world have become so competitive that it is impossible to make more than a normal return from investing.
政府应当实施减税并资助那些通过严格成本效益测试评估的计划;但大范围的新支出计划通常不会产生显著或即时的经济增长。	Governments should certainly cut taxes and fund initiatives that pass rigorous cost-benefit tests; but broad new spending programs usually do not yield a significant or immediate economic boost.
中国的这一转型可能包括接近跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）成员国寻求加入，这将是在亚太地区挫败美国的颇有讽刺意味的举动（特朗普一上台就退出了TPP ） 。	Such a turn by China could include approaching the Trans-Pacific Partnership’s member states for accession, in an ironic effort to outflank the US (which Trump withdrew from the TPP immediately upon taking office) in the Asia-Pacific region.
但美国对高度工业化国家（特别是亚洲）的持续贸易赤字正在导致美国去工业化加速，同时为美国保护主义者制造着借口。	But America’s ongoing trade deficits with highly industrialized countries, particularly in Asia, are accelerating de-industrialization in the US, while providing fodder for American protectionists.
气候变化是所有外部性中最大的一个，其有害后果将由全世界子孙后代承担，而不会主要由现在正在生产和消费化石燃料的人来承担。	And climate change is the biggest externality of all, with the harmful consequences likely to be suffered by future generations worldwide, rather than primarily by those currently producing and consuming fossil fuels.
这一进程需要几十年的时间，但是我们必须从现在开始并且采取全球性行动，使用二氧化碳排放税收和排放许可来为公司和个人建立基于市场基础之上的鼓励措施来做出必要的改变。	The process will take decades, but we must start now and act on a global basis, using carbon taxes and emission permits to create market-based incentives for companies and individuals to make the necessary changes.
但是，美联储反复下注与支持资产经济（Asset Economy ） ， 将其政策利率保持在零水平，这导致它用尽了传统工具。	Yet, because the US central bank had repeatedly upped the ante in providing support to the Asset Economy, taking its policy rate to zero, it had run out of traditional ammunition.
更多原油将被送往发电厂发电，更多地柴油将在私人发电机中燃烧，而更多地汽油将被用于从利雅得到科威特城的SUV车辆中，因为停电时唯一能保持凉爽的方式就是呆在汽车里。	More crude oil will be burned in power plants, more diesel will be burned in private generators, and more gasoline will be burned in SUVs from Riyadh to Kuwait City during blackouts in which the only place to keep cool will be in a moving car.
在这方面，当前的趋势是权力和控制日益向中央政府而非私人部门集中，这有可能在全球经济进入更高发展阶段时对中国起到妨碍作用。	Here, the current trend toward higher concentration of power and control in the central government, as opposed to the private sector, could hamstring China as the global economy reaches higher stages of development.
同样，随着政府债券收益变得像美国一样低下，即使像黑石集团创始人彼得·皮特森（Peter Peterson）这类末日预言家一直在大声疾呼，公众照样会对财政问题失去紧迫感。	Similarly, with government bond yields as low as they are in the US, the public has little sense of urgency about its fiscal problems, though some doomsayers, like Peter Peterson of the Blackstone Group, have been trying their best to awaken it.
投资于电力交通和基础设施 — — 包括电气化公共交通、充电站和共享电动车计划 — — 对发展有利无害。	Investing in electric mobility and infrastructure – including electrified public transportation, charging stations, and electric car-sharing programs – will help, not hurt, development.
在布加勒斯特将要讨论的两个最重大议题是是否邀请阿尔巴尼亚、克罗地亚和马其顿加入北约，以及是否向乌克兰和格鲁吉亚提供启动所谓“成员资格行动计划”的申请。	The two biggest issues in Bucharest will be whether to invite Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia to join NATO, and whether to offer applications to Ukraine and Georgia to start so-called “membership action plans.”
科文和卡普兰不应该仅仅依靠失业率一个数字；他们还应该纳入就业-人口比和其他他们一致认为具有诊断价值的指标。	Cowen and Caplan should not have relied on the unemployment rate alone; they should have included the employment-to-population ratio and other metrics they agreed would have diagnostic value.
新兴市场国家的央行行长们不愿意看见一个摇摆不定的美国：一会实施推动大量热钱流入及前者国内通胀螺旋上升的扩张性政策，一会又迅速实施收紧中止信贷并导致前者国内经济出现衰退。	Emerging-market central-bank governors fear a US that alternates between expansionary policy that fuels huge hot-money inflows and a domestic inflationary spiral, and rapid tightening that chokes off credit and causes a domestic recession.
随着银行间货币的崛起 — — 大部分靠政府债券支持 — — 财政政策已经成为决定润滑现代资本主义的实际货币数量的关键性因素。	With the rise of inter-bank money, backed mostly by government debt, fiscal policy has become an essential factor in determining the quantity of actual money lubricating modern capitalism.
但如果它们不进行再平衡，美联储继续升息将驱使投资者卖出（尤其是）德国和日本债券 — — 目前这些债券回报非常低，甚至为负 — — 买入收益率更高的美国债券。	But if they do not, the Fed’s continued interest-rate hikes would stimulate investors to trade their German and Japanese bonds, in particular – which are now bringing low and even negative returns – for higher-yielding US varieties.
但在当前总需求持续低迷、通胀低于目标和产出增长低迷或消失的情况下，全世界经济学家一直在苦苦寻找神力 — — 其中一些人把目光投向了直升机。	But in the current environment of persistently weak aggregate demand, below-target inflation, and slow or no output growth, economists worldwide have been desperately seeking deus ex machina – a search that, for some, has led to the heliport.
俄亥俄州的罗伯·波特曼（Rob Portman）甚至担任过小布什总统的白宫行政和预算管理局（Office of Management and Budget）主任。	Rob Portman of Ohio even served as Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under President George W Bush.
但是，卢旺达证明，如果纪律和坚强的领导能够改善生活、提供公共品，那么也许自由民主应该作为一项长期的重点。	But, as Rwanda has demonstrated, if discipline and strong leadership are improving lives and delivering public goods, perhaps liberal democracy should be a long-term priority.
一旦发生那种情况，对于周边国家 — — 以及整个世界经济 — — 的影响将比欧洲目前所面临的问题更为严重。	Once that happens, the impact on neighboring countries – and on the world economy – will be huge compared to the current European problem.
在Sen看来，这是非常令人遗憾的，因为它让人们在孩子需要扩展他们的知识层面的关键时候把他们的某一种身份 — — 宗教上的或是文化上的 — — 凌驾于所有其他身份之上。	According to Sen, this is regrettable because it leads to people giving one of their identities – religious, say, or cultural – priority over all others at a time when it is essential that children broaden their intellectual horizons.
但是，央行航政不应该尝试一刀切的解决办法，而应该致力于在正统货币政策框架内（即围绕货币稳定和独立性）发展个性化办法。	But, rather than try to define a single approach, central bankers should aim to develop individualized approaches within the orthodox monetary-policy framework, which revolves around price stability and independence.
举例来讲，在各国每年花在化石燃料补贴上的4000多亿美元中，只有远低于20%的份额最终能被最贫困的20%人口享受到。	Of the more than $400 billion that countries spend on fossil fuel subsidies each year, for example, far less than 20% of the benefits go to the poorest 20% of the population.
事实上，自安倍射出第一支箭以来，日本股市应声大涨，录得前所未有的40%的年涨幅，同时日元对美元贬值20 % ， 提振了日本企业的出口竞争力。	In fact, since Abe’s first arrow took flight, Japan’s stock market has soared with it, recording an unprecedented 40% annual gain, while the yen has depreciated against the dollar by 20%, boosting Japanese firms’ export competitiveness.
理想情况下，发展中国家男性的进步动力也会不断变化，将自主权和支持家庭、社会及其他关系的理念融合在一起，而且西方男性也会从中得到学习和提高。	Ideally, men’s drive for progress in the developing world would also evolve, uniting the idea of the autonomous self with support for family, community, and other ties, and Western men would learn from this as well.
因此埃及的民主发展状况非常关键，这可不仅因为它是国土面积最大的阿拉伯国家，而是它显然具备比邻国更为完备的条件去实现这一转型。	Developments in Egypt will be crucial, not only because it is the largest Arab country, but also because some of the necessary pre-conditions appear to have a stronger presence there than elsewhere in the region.
传统上作为爱荷华州共和党预选一支强大力量的保守基督教原教旨主义者一直主要支持另一位体制外候选人，著名神经外科医生本·卡森。	Conservative fundamentalist Christians – traditionally a powerful force in the Iowa Republican caucus – had been largely backing another anti-establishment candidate, the noted neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
2000年，联合国安理会认识到基于性别的暴力破坏安全并通过1325号决议。 该决议呼吁冲突各方尊重妇女和儿童的权利，特别是防止基于性别的暴力。	In 2000, the UN Security Council recognized that gender-based violence thwarts security and adopted Resolution 1325, which calls on parties in conflict to respect the rights of women and children, and particularly to prevent gender-based violence.

但一年半前政府着手重拳压打击购买多套住宅的行为 — — 购买者必须为第二和第三套住房分别预先支付50%和100%的房款。	But a year and a half ago, the government moved aggressively to dampen multiple property purchases – raising down payments to 50% for second homes and to 100% for third homes.
欧盟成员资格的前景正是欧盟在西巴尔干地区政策的核心所在。 在那个地区，欧洲开始表现出一种对使用强硬制约政策的厌恶，但这种做法对我们来说是危险的（比如在波黑 ） 。	The prospect of EU membership is at the heart of EU policy in the western Balkans, where we are starting to show (for example in Bosnia-Herzegovina) a dangerous disinclination to apply tough conditionality.
这会使国际货币基金组织看起来更像是一个以灵活方式提供流动性的中央银行，这种方式就像发达国家的中央银行最近提供大规模资金所使用的那样。	This would make the IMF more like a central bank, providing liquidity in an agile way, just as advanced countries’ central banks have been providing funds on a massive scale recently.
目前该委员会尚未有一个正式地位，而只是一个由位于瑞士巴塞尔的国际结算银行支持下的小机构（虽然其级别很高，且人员长期稳定 ） 。	Currently, the Board has no formal status and only a small, though high-quality, permanent staff, hosted by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel.
简而言之，凯恩斯在没有改变所有权的前提下，实现了社会民主人士的核心目标。 而且他认为，财富的再分配确实能保证充分的就业。	Moderate re-distribution was the more politically radical implication of Keynes’s economic theory, but the measures outlined above were also the limits of state intervention for him.
如果法国选民投了否定票，那与其说是反对宪法，还不如说是反对法国总统希拉克的投票，或者是他们对欧盟扩大至中欧的信号表示出的焦虑。	If the French electorate votes “No,” it will be much less a vote against the Constitution than a protest vote against President Jacques Chirac, or an expression of anxiety about the implications of the EU’s enlargement to Central Europe.
如今，所有欧洲领导人 — — 从意大利的蒙蒂到西班牙的拉霍伊和比利时的劳普 — — 都认为必须重振欧洲经济。	Now all European leaders – from Mario Monti in Italy to Mariano Rajoy in Spain and Elio Di Rupo in Belgium – agree on the need to revive the European economy.
)但是，当我询问首相近况如何时，他马上咧着嘴回答说 ： “ 当你知道不必在位另一场选举而战时，感觉好极了 。 ”	But no sooner had I asked the Prime Minister how he was than he replied with a grin: “It’s nice to know one doesn’t have to fight another election.”

但没有相关的病历记录基���就没有任何意义，这就像是俄文小说 — — 或者任何一种文字的小说 — — 如果没有对俄国历史的相应了解，单纯分析小说并没有多少意义。	But the genomes mean little without the corresponding medical records, just as the Russian novel – in any language – means little without a corresponding knowledge of Russian history.
欧洲新一届领导人手握创造庇护和移民新途径的重要机会 — — 新的方法必须认可安全有序的移民对源起国和目的地国同样有好处。	The EU’s new leaders have an important opportunity to fashion a fresh approach to asylum and migration – one that recognizes that safe, orderly migration can bring major benefits to countries of origin and destination alike.
伊朗支持过麦加的暴乱朝圣者、黎巴嫩自杀式炸弹袭击者和真主党游击队，后者不久前袭击过以色列，并曾在最近与沙特支持的叙利亚叛乱团体作战。	The non-state actors Iran has supported include rioting pilgrims in Mecca, suicide bombers in Lebanon, and Hezbollah militants, who have launched attacks on Israel and, more recently, battled Saudi-backed rebel groups in Syria.
据萨默斯的说法，高储蓄导致了低增长；根据本文的另一种解释，首先是高增长 — — 及其不同的特征 — — 推动了高储蓄。	According to Summers, high savings caused weak growth; under the alternative explanation offered here, it was primarily rapid growth – and its distinctive features – that drove high savings.
全球金融危机爆发后，联合国国际货币和金融系统改革专家委员会敦促我们为重组主权债务设计有效而公平的制度。	In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the United Nations Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System urged that we design an efficient and fair system for the restructuring of sovereign debt.
但是这并不说明为什么这些更为贫穷的移民保持宗教信仰，因为如果他们想要以美国的方式成功的话，就应该很快“同化 ” 。	Yet this doesn’t explain why these poorer immigrants remain religious; wanting to succeed US-style, they should want to be quick to “assimilate.”
那么，这一道德架构应该包含什么呢？ 1993年在芝加哥举行的世界宗教会议上提出的《世界伦理宣言》中，有一段话的内容如下：	So what should this ethical framework entail? A paragraph of the Declaration toward a Global Ethic of the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago in 1993 reads as follows:
为了结束无法无天，巴勒斯坦安全领导人就需要解除保护那些使用武器杀伤人民以及摧毁财产而可以逍遥法外的人。	In order to end lawlessness, the Palestinian security leadership will need to lift the protection given to armed individuals who have been using their weapons with impunity to injure, kill, and destroy property.
和（比如）世贸组织不同，金融稳定委员会背后没有国际条约，这意味着不能因为某国没有实施其表面上承诺的标准而制裁它。	Unlike the World Trade Organization, for example, no international treaty underpins the FSB, which means that countries cannot be sanctioned for failing to implement the standards to which they are ostensibly committed.
许多白宫讲稿撰写人使用过这样的措辞，但是，几乎没有第一夫人信守承诺，也没有第一夫人向客人分发过爆米花。	Many White House speechwriters have used that rhetoric, but almost no First Ladies have walked the talk and passed the popcorn.
类似地，2000年，作为里斯本战略（Lisbon Strategy）的一部分，欧盟寻求将国民研发支出提高到GDP的3 % 。	Likewise, in 2000, as part of its Lisbon Strategy, the EU sought to increase national spending on research and development to 3% of GDP.
Sendero靠种植毒品和走私木材补充收入，刻意选择那些久经干旱、采伐过度的山地村庄作为他们叛乱的根据地。	Sendero, which supplemented its income with drug production and timber smuggling, deliberately chose drought-weakened and deforested mountain villages as the stronghold of its insurgency.
此外，即使发射第三支箭 — — 结构性改革的政治意愿突然增强（这一前提能不能实现还大有问题 ） ， 任何生产率方面的回报也极有可能需要很长时间才会显现。	Moreover, even if the political will to launch third-arrow structural reforms were suddenly to strengthen – a dubious proposition – any productivity payback would most likely take a long time to materialize.
人类器官交易古已有之，但今天的情况因为现代生物医学和推动器官交易的思想和价值观的介入而变得与众不同。	Trade in humans and their bodies is not a new phenomenon, but today’s businesses are historically unique, because they require advanced biomedicine, as well as ideas and values that enhance the trade in organs.
美国不同意和不接受因达不到排放目标而受到制裁；但是，没有惩罚机制，排放削减要求就是无用功，只会激起人们对对抗气候变化努力的冷嘲热讽。	The US has not agreed to accept such sanctions for failing to meet emissions targets; but, without penalties, the exercise is largely futile and only encourages cynicism about the effort to combat climate change.
这些劳动者、家庭主妇和其他人员每天的生活费不超过0.6—0.7美元，他们的声音很少在政策讨论拥有一席之地。	These laborers, housewives, and others, some of whom live on the equivalent of $0.60-0.70 or less a day, are seldom given a place at the table to discuss policy.
伊斯兰堡 — — 沙特阿拉伯决定允许女性参军 — — 这是该国2030年远景经济改革计划的组成部分 — — 在这个因男女不平等而臭名昭著的王国里此举被视为向性别平等迈出的重要步骤而受到人们的广泛欢迎。	ISLAMABAD – Saudi Arabia’s decision to allow women to serve in the military – part of its Vision 2030 economic-reform program – has been widely celebrated as a step forward for gender parity in the notoriously unequal kingdom.
但如果背后的驱动因素是震怒，那么缺乏明确的目标只可能带来更多的愤怒和沮丧，而更多的愤怒和沮丧最终可能导致身体暴力和某种形式的政治虚无。	But if they are being driven by rage, then a lack of clear goals might merely produce more anger and frustration, which in turn could eventually lead to physical violence and some kind of political nihilism.
如果受害者无法事先确认身份，我们花血本拯救生命的意愿就会小得多，即使被拯救的生命数量会大得多 — — 比如提供更好的道路安全设施或预防性卫生手段教育。	We are far less willing to invest in saving lives when the victims cannot be identified in advance, even when the number of lives saved would be higher – for example, by providing better road safety or education in preventive health measures.
医生说你还有两年可活，如果采取化疗，可能将“生存期 ” （ 医学术语，意思是多活五年）延长50 % 。	The doctor says that you probably have two years to live, or a 50% expected improvement in “survival” (medical terminology for living another five years) if you undergo chemotherapy.
所有这些论点只适用于那些长期投资者。 他们能经得起另一次40%的股值暴跌，不改变投资策略直到市场认为风险降低。	All these arguments apply only to long-term investors who can afford to wait out another 40% decline in values and keep their money invested until perceived risk drops.
伦敦—很难将我对玛格丽特·撒切尔 — — 平凡但具有启发性 — — 的个人记忆从压倒性的历史判决分开。	LONDON – It is difficult to separate some of my personal memories of Margaret Thatcher – mundane but revealing – from the sweeping judgments of history.
但是最近的一些事件却宣告了欧洲一体化 — — 即建立一个会成为超级强权的全新联邦国家的“前所未有的紧密联盟”的说法的终结。	But recent events do spell the end of one version of European integration – the vision of an “ever closer union” producing a federal country that would become a new superpower.
随着住房价格和居民收入下降所导致的税收崩溃，美国有几十个自治市全部处在破产管理的边缘，这种状况与20世纪70年代的纽约非常类似。	With tax revenues collapsing due to falling home prices and incomes, dozens of US municipalities could well go into receivership, as New York City did in the 1970’s.
Sin embargo Kaczynski, que siendo miembro de Solidaridad en los años 80 luchó derribar el régimen comunista, sentía más desconfianza que Tusk hacia los rusos.	But Kaczynski, a member of Solidarity in the 1980’s who was eager to overthrow the communist regime, was more mistrustful of the Russians than Tusk.
然而它们都拒绝接受国内法治的基本原理 — — 包括保护弱势的借款人远离强大和暴虐的债权人的规定 — — 也在国际上适用。	Yet all refuse to accept that the rationale for a domestic rule of law – including provisions to protect weak borrowers from powerful and abusive creditors – applies at the international level as well.
为使尼日利亚的商业往来更加便利，政府还需要和援助机构及私营部门一道简化合法企业的注册及运营手续并加大投资基础设施建设。	To make it easier to do business in Nigeria, the government also will need to streamline processes for registering and running a legal business and, together with aid agencies and the private sector, increase investment in infrastructure.
美国经济分析局估算2018年第二季度的GDP增长达4.1 ％ ， 也是自2014年奥巴马治下实现4.9％以来的最高水平。	The US Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 reached 4.1% – the highest since the 4.9% seen under President Barack Obama in 2014.
就连针对我们的访问的准备工作 — — 大约在访问行程开始前不到24小时才获得批准 — — 也有点奥威尔风格。	Even the preparation for our visit, which was confirmed less than 24 hours before it began, was somewhat Orwellian.
教皇的话意味着同性恋是一种生活方式选择，是一种现代的堕落 — — 是对上帝和天性的世俗甚至亵渎的行为 — — 而不是生而具有的权利。	The pope’s words suggest that homosexuality is a kind of lifestyle choice, a form of modern decadence – a secular, even blasphemous act against God and nature – rather than a fact of birth.
而且，奥巴马对世界政治的情景智力从头到尾都受到其在印尼和肯尼亚的经历的影响，而他对美国政治的理解则完全受到他在芝加哥作为社区组织者的经历的影响。	In addition, his contextual intelligence about world politics has been shaped from the bottom up with experience in Indonesia and Kenya, and his understanding of American politics was shaped from the bottom up as a community organizer in Chicago.
在可能导致物价上升并在某些情况下引发更严重就业不安全感的整个报复阶段，政府都得将本已分裂的美国公众拧成一股绳。	A divided US public will need to be kept on board throughout the retaliatory phase, which will lead to higher prices and, in some cases, greater job insecurity.
中国所面临的真正挑战是如何利用大湾区等充满活力的超级城市群之间的竞争与合作来探索未来中国的可持续发展：也就是在创造经济增长的同时，以金融和环境可持续的方式来解决不平等和产能过剩等结构性挑战。	The real challenge China faces is to take advantage of dynamic urban clusters like the GBA not only to generate growth, but also to address structural challenges like inequality and excess capacity in financially and environmentally sustainable ways.
事实上，以色列和约旦部队正在合作防止各自边境被伊拉克或叙利亚圣战份子渗透，而埃及和以色列在西奈半岛的目标也是共同的。	Indeed, Israeli and Jordanian forces are now working together to secure their respective borders against infiltration by jihadists from Iraq or Syria, while Egypt and Israel now share the same objective in Sinai.
肯尼迪并没有简单地提出要求，而是采取了更耐人寻味也更非同寻常的举措：他呼吁美国人重新思考自己对战争与和平的态度。	Rather than issuing a list of demands, Kennedy did something far more interesting and unusual: he called upon Americans to reconsider their own attitudes about war and peace.
反对派领导人亚历克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexei Navalny）以他为主题做了最新的YouTube视频，导致俄罗斯各大城市成千上万示威者走上街头。	After the opposition leader Alexei Navalny made him the subject of recent YouTube videos, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across the country.
与此同时，对美国领导力感到失望的比例大涨15点，中位值为43 % ， 相比之下，对俄罗斯的失望比例为36 % ， 中国为30 % ， 德国为25 % 。	Meanwhile, disapproval of US leadership has surged by 15 points, to a median score of 43%, compared with 36% for Russia, 30% for China, and 25% for Germany.
潜在共和党候选人正就一切议题进行内部讨论，从经济到社会事务无所不包；很难说究竟哪种理念和观点会最终夺魁。	Potential Republican presidential candidates are arguing among themselves about almost everything, from economics to social issues; it is hard to say which ideas and arguments will end up on top.
此外，畜牧业生产消耗农业总用水量（占世界总用水量71 % ） 的1/3，以及小麦、黑麦、燕麦和玉米全球产量的超过40 % 。	Moreover, livestock production consumes one-third of the total water resources used in agriculture (which accounts for 71% of the world’s water consumption), as well as more than 40% of the global output of wheat, rye, oats, and corn.
在更东面的地方，阿富汗（复兴的塔利班可能重新掌权）和巴基斯坦（国内伊斯兰教徒一直是个安全隐患）有可能沦为半失败之国。	Further east, Afghanistan (where the resurgent Taliban could return to power) and Pakistan (where domestic Islamists pose a continued security threat) risk becoming semi-failed states.
而那3个未签署该条约并实施了核试验的国家 — — 印度，巴基斯坦和朝鲜 — — 则遭到了来自联合国安理会的国际谴责以及相关制裁。	The three countries that have failed to ratify the CTBT and have tested such devices – India, Pakistan, and North Korea – have faced universal condemnation from the UN Security Council, and UN sanctions.
对法国主流政客而言，放弃欧洲工程从而为重塑竞争力赢得必须的时间与其逻辑上的替代方案 — — 孤注一掷推进完全的欧洲政治联盟 — — 一样是不可想象。	For mainstream French politicians, renouncing the European project to buy the time required to restore competitiveness is as unthinkable as is the logical alternative: an all-out push for full European political union.
如果它将这笔税后的利润汇回美国，就要支付22.5%的税（美国税率35%与已经支付给爱尔兰政府的12.5%的差额 ） 。	If it repatriates the after-tax profits, it pays a 22.5% tax (the difference between the 35% US rate and the 12.5% tax that it already paid to the Irish government).
冲浪者比赛谁能在浪尖做出最高难的动作没有任何错误 — — 就好像看谁能从十米高台上以最高难的动作跳水一样。	There is nothing wrong with surfers competing to see who can do the most difficult maneuvers on a wave – just as there is nothing wrong with seeing who can pull off the most difficult dive from the ten-meter platform.
此外，尽管阿拉伯之春革命给他带来了意外的不受欢迎，但在犹豫一番后，他选择站在自己认为正确的历史潮流的一方。	And, while the Arab Spring revolutions presented him with an unwelcome surprise, after some hesitation he came down on what he regarded as the side of history.
如果比较容易投保的3500万人总费用预计为8000亿美元，那么需要花费多少资金才能为剩下这2500万人上保险？	How much would it cost to insure them if the gross cost is now projected at $800 billion for the easier-to-insure 35 million?
实际上，各地的精英都靠这样的信条过活，而普通人也并不怎么介意，条件是精英履行了他们在交易里的责任：在敌人面前保护国家，并且改善生活条件。	In fact, elites everywhere have always lived by this injunction, and ordinary people have not minded very much, provided that the elites fulfill their part of the bargain: protect the country against its enemies and improve living conditions.
在诸如软件和研发等领域的无形资产投资在2009年的危机后下跌本身就较为短暂且幅度不大，同时恢复的幅度也更快。	Intangible investment, in areas such as software and research and development, recovered far more quickly from a brief and smaller post-crisis dip in 2009.
不幸的是，鉴于布什多次违反美国的宪法制衡传统，声称其总统职位授予其侵犯权利的单边权力，布什目前看起来并不会受到弹劾的困扰。	Unfortunately, given Bush’s repeated assertions – in defiance of America’s constitutional tradition of checks and balances – that his office endows him with unilateral powers to violate rights, he appears to be untroubled by that prospect.
当然，两起袭击的程度大相径庭 — — 2001年数千人被杀，国家标志也被摧毁，而波士顿的爆炸案致三人死，约260人伤。	The magnitude of the two attacks was, of course, very different – thousands were killed and major national landmarks destroyed in 2001, whereas the Boston bombing killed three people and injured roughly 260.
正如与朝鲜，叙利亚和伊朗那样，战略上的隐忍已经被烦躁所取代，而秉承民族主义的特朗普政府领导正是冲在了攻击中国的最前线。	As is the case with North Korea, Syria, and Iran, strategic patience has given way to impatience, with the nationalistic Trump administration leading the charge against China.
此外，联合国和阿盟叙利亚事务特使布拉西米（Lakhdar Brahimi）报告说，反对派武装包括38国人。	Moreover, Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN and Arab League special envoy for Syria, reports that opposition forces include 38 nationalities.
德国统一不是心中愿望的问题；而是“一个普通的商业交易，没人会在其中损失，但所有人都会为他人尽量争取 。 ”	German unity was not a question of the heart’s desire; it was “a mundane business transaction, in which no one should lose, but everyone should grab as much as they could for themselves.”
由于人口高峰期早已过去，日本的人口曲线将在持续缺乏大规模移民的情况下开始日渐加速下滑，并成为一个比现在小得多的国家。	Having already passed its population peak, it will, in the continued absence of significant immigration, begin an increasingly rapid slide down the demographic curve, becoming a country that is much smaller than it is today.
“绿色经济”一词提出已经很多年了 — — 甚至要早于1992年首届地球峰会 — — 本意是为了提供考察经济和可持续性之间联系的新视角。 但在气候变化已成现实、商品价格节节攀升、清洁空气、可耕土地和清洁水源日渐稀缺的世界中，绿色经济一词被赋予了新的含义。	But it has gained a new impetus in a world where climate change is already a reality, commodity prices are rising, and basic resources such as clean air, arable land, and fresh water are increasingly scarce.
但有些竞选 — — 比如将于2016年举行的未来联合国秘书长的竞选 — — 依然静悄悄地不引人注目。	Yet some races – such as that for the next United Nations secretary-general, which will also be held in 2016 – still occur largely under the radar.
形形色色原教旨主义分子的教条既咄咄逼人又为祸不浅，它们都有着共同的特色： 那就是植根于对现代社会的恐惧和愤懑的气势汹汹的怨恨。	The strident and damaging dogmatism of fundamentalists of every stripe has a common feature: a truculent sense of grievance, rooted in fear and resentment of modernity.
英国财政大臣奥斯本（George Osborne）赞美成立伦敦清算行对伦敦金融城的未来“极其重要 ” 。	British Chancellor George Osborne hailed the creation of a London clearing bank as “hugely important” for the financial future of the City.
第二根支柱是促进技术推广和创新及鼓励企业家精神的工业体系，从而使新加入者能够与各行各业的现有公司竞争。	The second pillar is an industrial system that fosters technological diffusion and innovation, and encourages entrepreneurship, so that new entrants can compete with incumbent firms across all sectors.
2007—2008年危机开始时，如果德国愿意支持联合欧洲危机应对机制，那么欧元区的基本漏洞可能已经弥补上了。	At the beginning of the crisis, in 2007-2008, the eurozone’s fundamental flaws could have been corrected had Germany been willing to support a joint European crisis response.
在与美国国内商业界沟通后，美国联邦储备委员会已经警告说由于全球贸易关系的不确定性，企业的投资计划可能会“缩减或推迟 ” 。	Already, the US Federal Reserve, relying on its contacts in the domestic business community, has warned that corporate investment plans could be “scaled back or postponed” because of uncertainty over global trade relations.
而在今年9月最后一周的这场会议也例行汇集了一长串的世界领袖 — — 但或许我们不应再那么轻率地使用“世界领袖”这个词了。	As usual, this year’s meeting, during the last week of September, brought together a long list of world leaders, although perhaps the term “world leader” should no longer be used so lightly.
但不利的全球条件不管多么麻烦，都不应该让央行行长忽视未受过检验的政策的风险 — — 首屈一指的便是目前许多人提出的“直升机撒钱 ” 。	But adverse global conditions, however troubling, should not lead central bankers to neglect the risks of untested policies – above all the “helicopter drops” that many are now proposing.
你也许会说，过去的事已经过去了，并且从叙利亚遍及全国的灾难看，俄罗斯的干预至少可以阻止叙利亚一败到底的颓势。	One might argue that the past is past and that, in view of the general disaster in Syria, Russia’s intervention will at least have the benefit of halting the country’s free fall.
但仍然存在许多严重的问题：低下的贷款意愿以及昂贵的外币贷款对于东欧国家的收支平衡来说是一个真正的负担。	Yet serious problems remain. An unwillingness to lend and expensive loans in foreign currencies are a real burden to eastern balance sheets.
这一时期的末段被称之为网站热或互联网热，但大部分股价增长都先于科技驱动的“新经济”叙事而存在，而通胀下降也在整个过程中发挥了作用。	The end of this period has been called the dot-com boom or Internet boom, but most of the price growth preceded the tech-driven “new economy” narrative, and declining inflation helped throughout.
但今年春天发生的欧元恐慌却迎来了转机，那些手握巨额外汇储备的国家暗示说希望将欧元作为危机不断的美元以及日元的替代货币。	The turning point in this spring’s euro panic came when big holders of reserve currencies signaled that they saw the need for the euro as an alternative to the increasingly problematic dollar and the equally vulnerable yen.
1997年亚洲金融危机之前，流向亚洲的资本流突然中断；而在2008年9月雷曼兄弟倒闭后，全球短期借贷突然干涸，导致了大衰退（Great Recession ） 。	The 1997 Asian financial crisis followed a sudden stop of capital inflows to Asia, and global short-term lending suddenly dried up after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, causing the Great Recession.
这一自主加入方针受到了一些批评，但计划应该被归为“自愿”还是“强制”无关紧要，因为国际协定一般只适用于决定加入其中的主权国家。	This opt-in approach has some critics, but whether a program is categorized as “voluntary” or “mandatory” is beside the point, because international accords generally apply only to the sovereign countries that have decided to join them.
那些利用当前针对个人和股东收益的道德赋格（ethical fugue）的人，当政治钟摆重新回到理智时必须对此负责。	Those who take advantage of the current ethical fugue for personal or shareholder gain will have to answer for it when the political pendulum swings back to sanity.
伊朗是世界第三大石油净出口国（其天然气储量也位居全球第二 ） ， 同时还占据着通往其他中亚和中东石油供应国的战略门户。	Iran is the world’s third-largest net oil exporter (with the world’s second-largest natural-gas reserves as well), and it is a strategically located gateway to other energy suppliers in Central Asia and the Middle East.
新兴市场经济体所信任的双边援助和IMF等多边机构摇摆不定，这使得它们 — — 在亚洲的带领下 — — 开始持续地推动金融自力更生。	With their trust in bilateral assistance and multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund shaken, emerging-market economies – led by those in Asia – embarked on a sustained drive toward greater financial self-reliance.
与地区其他国家相比，肯尼亚的关键部门 — — 包括教育、交通、通信、农业和旅游 — — 管理相当专业，令许多东非国家艳羡不已。	Compared with the rest of the region, the country’s key sectors – including education, transport, communications, agriculture, and tourism – are professionally managed and the envy of much of East Africa.
更糟糕的是，任何偏向英国的特殊待遇都会树立一个先例，诱使其他态度冷淡的欧盟成员国提出退出威胁和要求重新谈判。	Worse still, any special favors for Britain would set a precedent and tempt other lukewarm EU members to make exit threats and demand renegotiation.
如果有人试图在谈判雇佣合同时拿公共服务职务的薪酬与私有部门比较，那么他不该来当公务员，而应当直接去私有部门找工作。	Anyone seeking to compare a public-service job with the private sector in negotiating an employment contract should simply seek work in the private sector rather than for the public good.
由于埃及的经济萎靡不振，当选的政客可能会试图通过应付军队的民用资产 — — 具体点说就是修订优惠税率并采用新税收形式 — — 来改善经济状况。	With the Egyptian economy suffering, elected politicians might seek to improve conditions by moving against the military’s civilian assets – namely, by revising the preferential rates and imposing a form of taxation.
随后的几届美国政府都坚持这一方针，而民调显示这在日本人中间也有很高的接受度 — — 不仅是因为2011年东北地震和海啸后的紧密救灾合作。	Subsequent US administrations have upheld this approach, and opinion polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan – not least owing to close cooperation on disaster relief following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011.
与此同时，生产阶段日益激烈的竞争压低了价格，使实际的生产者 — — 无论是雇主还是工人 — — 在价值蛋糕中的份额日益减少。	Meanwhile, increasingly intense competition in the production phase drives down prices, so that the actual producers, whether employers or workers, receive diminishing shares of the value pie.
默克尔的中右翼基督教民主联盟（CDU）获得33%的选票，是自1949年以来的最差表现，但仍足以使其成为议会第一大党。	Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union took 33% of the vote, its worst result since 1949, though still enough to give the CDU the most seats in parliament.
尽管中国的官方发展援助仍然只是经合组织国家开支的一小部分，但中国已经表现出有兴趣在发展援助、尤其是卫生领域担负起领导角色。	Although Chinese ODA is still a fraction of what OECD countries spend, China has signaled its interest in becoming a development leader, especially in the health sector.
不过，在迫不及待地评判现行政策之前，我们应该对近来美国经济复苏期就业增长缓慢的问题有一个清醒的认识。	Nevertheless, before rushing to judgment about current policy, we should recognize the trend in recent US recoveries of slow job growth.
芝加哥 — — 当今非洲最紧迫的公共卫生挑战之一也是报道最少的：那就是癌症，世界各地最主要的死亡原因。	CHICAGO – One of the most pressing public-health challenges in Africa today is also one of the least reported: cancer, a leading cause of death worldwide.
只要投资者认为意大利和西班牙最终能够被OMT所救，这些国家的借贷成本就将保持低位，救援也就没有必要实施。	As long as investors believe that Italy and Spain will eventually be rescued by the OMT, these countries’ borrowing costs will be low, and the rescue will not be needed.
因此如果一大批劳动年龄的美国人，无论教育水平高低，变成了技术上的闲置人员或不再拥有一份维持最基本体面生活水平的收入，情况会变得怎么样？	So what happens when the labor of a large number of working-age Americans, regardless of their education, is rendered technologically redundant or no longer commands an income adequate to provide a minimally decent standard of living?
美国所建立的联盟和关系范围 — — 包括其与一些崛起大国之间的关系 — — 是任何其他全球行动方无法比拟的，并且在可预见的未来继续保持这一优势。	The range of alliances and relationships that the US has created, including with several of the rising powers, far surpasses that of any other global actor – and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
尽管这样的部署在多数美国人看来纯属不可思议（其实在国会及其他机构维持对统一朝鲜的预算支持才是真正的挑战 ） ， 但中国的安全专家们却不能不害怕。	Though such deployments would be inconceivable to most thinking Americans (indeed, the real task would be to maintain budget support in Congress and elsewhere for any deployments in a united Korea), Chinese security experts worry about it.
如果政策制定者忽视特定地区或部门的损失，那么后果就是民众的愤怒和社会分化 — — 并对经济的运行轨迹持消极态度。	When policymakers ignore losses in particular regions or sectors, the result is anger and social division – and negative views about the economy’s trajectory.
也许偶尔确实会有这样的情况，但很多地区能够快速有效的皮试却没有广泛使用 — — 在发展中国家还是发达国家都是如此。	While this may be true in rare cases, there are many areas where fast and effective tests exist, but are not yet used widely – either in developing or developed countries.
普林斯顿 — — 美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马本周出访沙特阿拉伯参加海湾合作委员会首脑会议是在两国关系极为罕见的糟糕时刻。	PRINCETON – US President Barack Obama’s visit to Saudi Arabia this week, to attend the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, comes at a time when relations between the two countries have rarely been worse.
再一次，我们被告知未来劳动力市场参与者应该接受定向就业教育和可转移社保，以帮助他们从一个被自动化的工作场所换到另一个。	Again, we are told that future labor-market participants should be equipped with job-targeted education and portable social-security pots to help them jump from one automated workplace to another.
最后，卢旺达非洲女性教育人士论坛（FAWE）已经资助了在该国优秀高中学习科学、技术、工程和数学等学科领域的1，200名女性学生接受教育。	Finally, the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) in Rwanda has funded the education of 1,200 girls enrolled at the country’s top-performing secondary schools specializing in STEM subjects.
世界有足够的零碳能源用来推动整个全球经济的发展 — — 事实上，零碳能源可以推动的全球经济规模可以远大于今天。	The world has enough zero-carbon energy sources to power the entire global economy – indeed to power a global economy much larger than today’s.
他们的联合政府在议会中占据较大的多数席位。 政治算术也并不表明可以有能够存活下来的其他的议会组成选择。	Their coalition government enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority; nor does the political arithmetic imply a viable parliamentary alternative.
此外政府在金融上很难灵活应变；经常被受监管者牵着鼻子走；当光景好的时候，又没有官员愿意去惹怒那些金融机构，给自己找麻烦。	It is not financially nimble; it is often captured by the regulated; and when economic times are good, no official wants to spoil the party.
但是，尽管这是迈向管理主权财富基金法律框架、制度和治理结构以及投资和风险管理政策的重要的第一步，但它们的应用并不是平等的，也被广泛认为是不充分的。	But, while they are an important first step toward managing SWFs’ legal framework, institutional and governance structure, and investment and risk-management policies, they are unevenly applied, and are widely considered inadequate.
我们强调社会被两股政治裂痕所割裂：将少数人和种族、宗教或意识形态多数人分开的身份裂痕；以及将富人和其他人分开的财富差距。	We emphasize that societies are divided by two potential cleavages: an identity split that separates a minority from the ethnic, religious, or ideological majority, and a wealth gap that pits the rich against the rest of society.
正如许多专家所警告的那样，当无人机首次空袭炸死妇女或儿童，现场和葬礼的视频将被发到网上让整个穆斯林世界看到。	As many experts warn, the first time a drone strike kills a woman or child, a video of the scene and the funeral will be posted for the Muslim world to see.
随着投入紧急援助的钱越来越多，大家越来越清楚地认识到这不过是金融市场错误地评估风险的又一个例子，就像它们在过去几年一直在做的那样。	As the bailout has ballooned, it is increasingly clear that this was merely another example of financial markets mis appraising risk – just as they have done consistently in recent years.
伦敦经济学院人类学家大卫·格雷伯尔（David Graeber）从政治活动参与者如何与官僚体系互动的角度来分析这个问题。	The London School of Economics anthropologist David Graeber frames the problem in terms of how political actors approach bureaucracy.
该组织另一位重要人物是谢尔登·阿德尔森，这位拉斯维加斯的赌场大亨为积极支持以色列的共和党政客捐赠了成百上千万美金。	Another major figure in the group is Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate who donates millions of dollars to Republican politicians who most actively support Israel.
如果这些紧迫问题能够在欧盟层面得到解决 — — 就像默克尔在她的胜选词中所说的那样 — — 对欧盟的支持就有可能最终战胜将票投给的AfD的不满的选民。	If those pressing issues are addressed at the European level, as Merkel suggested in her victory statement, support for Europe could end up winning back the discontented voters who cast their ballots for the AfD.
资本在二十一世纪重新点燃了经济学家对财富及其分配态势的兴趣。 亚当·斯密、大卫·李嘉图和卡尔·马克思等古典经济学家都曾关注同样的话题。	Capital in the Twenty-First Century has reignited economists’ interest in the dynamics of wealth and its distribution – a topic that preoccupied classical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx.
届时57个伊斯兰会议组织成员国的GDP总量（目前只占全球的13 % ） 将在未来几十年内轻易翻一番。	As a result, the combined GDP of the 57-member Organization of the Islamic Conference nations – now only about 13% of global output – will easily double in the coming decades.
但缅甸和其他湄公河流域国家被认为是中国的“好邻居 ” ， 且完全在中国实力覆盖范围之内，因此公众对中国利益在这些地区受到威胁十分愤怒。	But Myanmar and the other Mekong River countries are supposed to be the country’s “good neighbors,” and are completely within reach of Chinese power, so public anger over threats to the country’s interests in these places is intense.
如今，极端贫困主要集中在非洲；据世界银行2018年《贫困与共同繁荣 》 （ Poverty and Shared Prosperity）报告，全世界最穷的28个国家有27个在非洲，其中每个国家的贫困率都高于30 % 。	Today, extreme poverty is mostly contained to Africa; according to the World Bank’s 2018 Poverty and Shared Prosperity report, 27 of the world’s 28 poorest countries are on the continent, and each has a poverty rate above 30%.
而这一短暂（并很快告终）的停歇启发了美国国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森（Rex Tillerson ） ， 让他宣布朝鲜领导人金正恩已经表现出“克制 ” 。	That short interval, which has since ended, was enough to inspire US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to declare that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was showing “restraint.”
在欧盟，容克计划 — — 用欧盟资金来帮助风险较大、创新程度较高的项目融资 — — 的目标是在2016—2018年间引导3,000亿美元以上的投资。	In the European Union, the Juncker Plan – which draws on EU funds to help finance riskier and more innovative projects – aims to generate more than $300 billion in investment between 2016 and 2018.
但对于为何共和党人拿不出奥巴马医保的替代方案，还有一个更深层次的原因：ACA完全符合他们自己的想法。	But there is another, deeper reason why the Republicans cannot come up with an alternative to Obamacare: the ACA is based firmly on their own ideas.
这些投票有的只是象征性的（因为奥巴马拥有否决权 ） ； 但重要的事实仍然是，共和党一直在酝酿替代方案，等到共和党成为总统时就可以取ACA而代之。	Those votes may have been merely symbolic, given Obama’s veto power; nonetheless, the striking fact remains that the Republicans never bothered to try to formulate an alternative in the event that one of their own would one day become president.
目前的不少政策非但没有制定行业相关排放总量的减排计划，反而激励企业在每头奶牛身上榨取更多的奶，让肉牛能更快地走上屠宰线。	Rather than setting targets for the reduction of total industry-related emissions, many current policies create incentives for firms to squeeze more milk from each dairy cow and bring beef cattle to slaughter faster.
俄罗斯总统普京是一个现实主义者；他知道，让俄罗斯应声而出，在以巴冲突中充当领导者不利于他和双方的关系，也不会让它们走向和解。	President Vladimir Putin is a realist; he knows that heeding the call for Russia to assume a leadership role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would damage his relationships with both parties, without bringing them any closer to a settlement.
最后，胡温和最高领导层已经把他们自己变成了超级消防队员，按照中共的说法，他们具有“把反抗消灭在萌芽之中”的超级能力。	Finally, Hu, Wen, and the rest of the top leadership have turned themselves into superb firefighters with an uncanny ability to, in Party parlance, “nip the seeds of opposition before they sprout.”
2010年，一位突尼斯水果小贩出于对一位腐败警官专横行为的愤慨而自焚，点燃了整个阿拉伯世界的革命之火。	Indignation at the highhanded behavior of a corrupt police officer helped to drive a Tunisian fruit seller to set himself on fire in 2010, touching off revolutions across the Arab world.
我们可以希望东欧 — — 或墨西哥 — — 的经济发展将让条件变得足够平等，结束从一个地区流向另一个地区的净流动；但结束来自中东和非洲的难民流的难度让人望而生畏。	We may hope that economic development in Eastern Europe – or Mexico – will equalize conditions sufficiently to end net flows from one region to another; but ending the flow of refugees from the Middle East and Africa is altogether more daunting.
贸易转移一直被认为是没有什么实际重要性的理论构建，因为参与优先贸易协定的大部分经济体的关税已经相当低了。	Trade diversion has often been regarded as a theoretical construct with little real-world significance, because most of the economies engaged in preferential trade agreements already had rather low tariffs.
据世界粮农组织（FAO ） 、 国际农业发展基金（IFAD）和世界粮食计划（WFP）估算，这些投资成本相当于2014年世界GDP的0.3 % 。	According to estimates by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Food Programme (WFP), it would cost the equivalent of 0.3% of the world’s 2014 income.
桑德卜指出，这不但能将公共金融和银行的不当行为隔离；还能形成一个均衡，净债务国和净债权国之间达到类似于财政风险共担的格局。	Sandbu argues that this would not only insulate public finance from the follies of banks; it would also lead to an equilibrium that mimics fiscal risk-sharing between countries that are net borrowers and countries that are net lenders.
相反，他们的选择基于谁是大家眼中最漂亮的人，以及大家认为大家怎么看 — — 最后的结果就像是猫在追逐自己的尾巴。	Instead, their choice is based on a prediction of who average opinion believes is the prettiest, and what average opinion thinks average opinion is – thus ending up like cats chasing after their own tails.
伊朗政权的目标集中在伊拉克和巴林等什叶派多数国家以及科威特、黎巴嫩和也门等什叶派虽占少数但人数众多的国家。	The regime has specifically targeted countries with Shia majorities, such as Iraq and Bahrain, and those with significant Shia minorities, such as Kuwait, Lebanon, and Yemen.
这正是为什么欧洲的银行现在不太愿意互相进行拆借的原因，因为它们可能会把钱借给一家正陷入严重财政困难的机构。	This is why European banks are now reluctant to lend to each other. They could be lending to an institution that is in serious financial trouble.
但其实在这两种情况下美国都应该说不：虽然援助是公开透明的，但富裕国家从饿莩遍野的穷邻居处收受金钱的象征意义一点都算不上光辉。	Well, in both cases, the US should have said no: while the aid is transparent, the symbolism of a rich country taking money from a poor neighbor with millions of suffering people is hardly attractive.
在美国，存在不提高税率而增加收入的空间，即限制所谓的税收开支（tax expenditures ） — —写入税收规则而不由国会每年划拨的支出形式。	In the US, there is scope to raise revenue without increasing tax rates, by limiting so-called tax expenditures – the forms of spending that are built into the tax rules rather than appropriated annually by Congress.
那些分离主义分子都是些政治激进派 — — 在萨克森是左派闹事，而在巴伐利亚和莱茵地区却是极右派在活动。	The separatists were politically radical – on the left in Saxony, and on the far right in Bavaria and the Rhineland.
但巴黎银行似乎对此不太感兴趣；它自身的调查与通用汽车的投入程度无法相提并论，也并没有通过可以发现问题的有效控制措施来防止继续违规。	BNP did not seem to do any of this with gusto; its investigation did not match the effort made, for example, by GM. It did not prevent subsequent violations by implementing effective controls to detect problems.
但它带给了被战争撕裂和贫穷到让人绝望的欧洲一个对新未来积极构想，这都是希腊，塞浦路斯，更不用说中东和北非国家所急切需要的。	But it gave war-torn and desperately poor Europeans a positive vision of a new future, something that Greece and Cyprus, not to mention Middle Eastern and North African countries, desperately need.
如果双方想形成好的而不是坏的讨价还价（甚至彻底的合作失败，从而导致希腊事实退出欧元区 ） ， 这是必要条件。	This will be necessary if the two sides are to arrive at a good bargain, rather than a bad one – or even an outright failure to cooperate, so that Greece effectively drops out of the euro.
但那些对手册第五版制定修改意见的精神病学家却没有接受过概念分析方面的训练，而且，虽然事先已经受到了警告，他们却依然用一种不系统的临时性手法来应对“正常还是障碍”的问题。	Yet the psychiatrists who formulated the DSM-5’s proposed changes are not trained in conceptual analysis, and, though amply forewarned, they have addressed the normal-versus-disordered issue in an unsystematic, ad hoc manner.
发自伊斯兰堡 — — 上周南亚区域合作联盟（SAARC）在马尔代夫召开了第17届年度峰会，各成员国领导人均有出席。	ISLAMABAD – The leaders of the member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation met last week in the Maldives for their 17th annual summit.
从这个角度讲，我们是生活在特朗普时代吗？ 在这个时代里，特朗普复兴了美国纳粹分子在20世纪30年代所高举的、鼓动偏隘的“美国优先”口号。	In this sense, are we living in the époque of Trump, in which Trump’s revival of the “America First” slogan of the American Nazis in the 1930s has encouraged a loosening of bigoted tongues?
在石油生产和政府渎职已经将环境破坏殆尽、人民生活也早已一塌糊涂的尼日尔三角洲地区， 愤怒的年轻人以沼泽为根据地，发动了针对联邦军队的起义。	In the Niger delta, where oil production and official neglect have devastated the environment and wrecked livelihoods, enraged youths took to the swamps and led an insurgency against Federal troops.
即使英国首相特蕾莎·梅（Theresa May）设法让议会通过了其提出的脱欧协议，这一过程也可能加速。	And this process will likely accelerate even if British Prime Minister Theresa May manages to get her proposed exit deal through Parliament.
在这里，传统智慧还有第二道防线：巴西坐拥3,600亿美元储备，而阿根廷还不到500美元，还要偿还IMF贷款。	Here the conventional wisdom mounts its next line of defense: Brazil is sitting on $360 billion of reserves, while Argentina barely has $50 billion or so, plus the undisbursed portion of the IMF loan.
欧元区的扩张速度因而放缓，尤其是在中东欧地区，至今只有斯洛文尼亚和斯洛伐克（分别在2007和2009年）成为这个单一货币体系的一员。	Expansion of the euro zone has therefore been slow, especially in central and eastern Europe, where to date only Slovenia (2007) and Slovakia (2009) have become members of the single currency.
方济各的“兔子”说被媒体广泛报道，但很少有媒体报道，他还说，外部机构不应该将其关于家庭规模控制的观点施加给发展中世界。	"Francis's “rabbit"" comment was widely covered in the media, but fewer reported that he had also said that no outside institution should impose its views about regulating family size on the developing world."
如能实现这一点，到2030年中国的GDP总量估计要比政策制定者们单纯追求投资拉动型增长的方式多产出近5万亿美元。	If it does, its annual GDP could be an estimated $5 trillion larger by 2030 than it is likely to be if policymakers continue to pursue investment-led growth.
如果旧的格局正在逆转，那么几乎可以肯定变化来自让成百上千万人加入中产阶级大军的印度经济转型，这些人带来了新的精神与活力。	If the old pattern is being reversed, the change is almost certainly a result of India’s economic transformation, which has enabled millions of people to join the middle class, bringing with them a new energy and dynamism.
遇刺身亡的车臣前总统卡德罗夫曾不无理由地暗示说这些资金中的80%最后都被莫斯科和当地的企业揣进了腰包。 这些企业从持续的车臣冲突中谋利。	President Akhmat Kadyrov, the murdered Chechen president, was right to suggest that 80% of this money ends up in the pockets of Moscow and regional firms who benefit from the Chechen conflict continuing.
比如，以色列已经与一些阿拉伯国家接触，它们愿意将巴勒斯坦问题作为从属于谨慎的双边关系（事实上即安全问题）的次要问题。	For example, Israel has reached out to those Arab countries that are willing to subordinate the Palestinian problem to discreet bilateral relations, essentially on security matters.
生物技术公司不但改变着农民收获的作物，现在还要试图控制农业生态系统中每个组成部分的基因图谱，不管是传粉昆虫还是杂草和害虫。	Rather than merely altering the crops that farmers bring to harvest, biotechnology corporations will now try to control the genetic makeup of every component in the agricultural ecosystem, from the pollinators to the weeds and pests.
长期以来，智力测验的批评家们已经指出这些测验忽略了精神生活的重要方面，主要是类似社会情感能力，情感转移能力和人际交流技能等非认知领域。	Critics of intelligence tests have long pointed out that the tests ignore important parts of mental life, mainly non-cognitive domains such as socio-emotional abilities, empathy, and interpersonal skills.
“出售”或给予该地区的每一件新的美国武器系统都会增加战争扩大和进一步军事政变的几率，也会增加将这些武器用来对付美国自身的几率。	Each new US weapons system “sold” or given to the region increases the chances of expanded war and further military coups, and to the chance that the arms will be turned on the US itself.
这一措施也是出于政治考虑：向银行注入新股本应是更加有效之法，但奥巴马担忧此举会招致国有化和社会主义化的谴责。	This, too, was guided by political considerations: it would have been more efficient to inject new equity into the banks, but Obama feared accusations of nationalization and socialism.
尽管该地区各国有办法阻止委内瑞拉的政治、经济和人权状况继续恶化，但却缺乏意愿 ， ， 而世界其他地区的目光纷纷对准了乌克兰，这也让它们没有压力采取行动。	Though the region’s countries have the means to stop the growing political, economic, and human-rights catastrophe in Venezuela, they lack the will, while the rest of the world’s attention to Ukraine has removed any pressure on them to act.
比如，如果波兰不想采用欧元，就不应该强迫它这样做，并且这一决定也不应该妨碍其他欧元区国家继续迈向一体化。	For example, if Poland does not want to adopt the euro, it should not be forced to do so, and that decision should not prevent other eurozone countries from moving ahead with integration.
曼谷—社交媒体已不再是“新鲜人 ” ， 但在2016年，Twitter和Facebook等平台似乎准备将传统报纸扔进故纸堆中。	BANGKOK – Social media are no longer the new kid on the block, but in 2016, platforms like Twitter and Facebook looked poised to nudge traditional newspapers into obsolescence.
他曾说 ： “ 从长期起来看，正义的战争比最富庶的和平年代更能让人的灵魂受益 。 ” 一个世纪后，现任美国总统奥巴马在中东身陷两场无望获胜的战争。	Such was the existentialist worldview of US President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Theodore Roosevelt, a major advocate of American expansionism: “A just war is, in the long run, far better for a man’s soul than the most prosperous peace.”
鲁德亚德·吉卜林在著名的“东西方民谣”中写道： “哦，东方就是东方，西方就是西方，这两者永远是泾渭分明的 。 ”	Rudyard Kipling famously wrote in “The Ballad of East and West”: “Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.”
而对美军高技术人才的招募和挽留情况也将随着对两场冲突的介入力度减弱而有所上升，一再推迟的军事现代化进程也将重新启动。	Recruitment and retention of highly skilled individuals in the US armed forces will increase as the level of effort in the two conflicts winds down, and a great deal of deferred military modernization will occur.
汉斯莫拉维茨和其他计算机科学家在20世纪80年代时指出，对我们来说轻而易举的事情，对最先进的人工智能来说也是难于上青天；反之，人工智能常常能够轻松完成我们认为困难的事情。	Hans Moravec and other computer scientists pointed out in the 1980s that what is simple for us is hard for even the most sophisticated AI; conversely, AI often can do easily what we regard as difficult.
如果美国选择与阿萨德及其势力正面交火，那么，他们就冒着与伊拉克最大的教派社区，即什叶派分道扬镳的风险，从而给反占领抵抗火上加油，也有可能让布什彻底失败。	Should the US choose to face al-Sadr and his forces head on, they risk alienating Iraq’s largest sectarian community, the Shi’a, adding fuel to the anti-occupation resistance and thus probably dooming Bush to failure.
这一想当然的证据是错误���，因为50是PMI的分界线，但它不是增长和衰退的分界线，而是增长加速和减速的分界线。	The supposed evidence was wrong because 50 is the PMI’s dividing line not between growth and recession, but between accelerating and slowing growth.
因其在伊拉克、叙利亚和中东其他地方的所作所为和未能作为，美国的外交政策都应在很大程度上为导致难民外流的结果负责。	Both by what it has done and what it has failed to do in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere in the Middle East, American foreign policy bears more than a little responsibility for outcomes that have led to the refugee exodus.
如果要说真正的成本，那就是仅美国就失去了800万份工作，就业率也从最高峰下跌了6 % — —这也是与1945年后历次衰退最大的不同之处 — — 如今距离危机爆发已经过去31个月了，失业率依然徘徊在低于最高峰5%的水平上。	The cost is eight million jobs in the US alone, with employment falling 6% from its peak and – in a major departure from other post-1945 recessions – remaining 5% below that peak today, 31 months after the crisis broke in earnest.
俄罗斯是一个能源超级大国。 至少在某种来说，俄罗斯可以开启其“保险箱”去缓解国家最近伪造司法选举结果而使其公民所遭受到的羞辱感。	As an energy superpower, Russia can open its coffers to appease, at least in part, the humiliation that it has inflicted on its citizens by falsifying the country’s recent legislative election results.
收入和财富不平等性加剧的原因是多样而微妙的；但最近一段时期的极端宽松货币政策所造成的意外后果必须受到指责。	The causes of rising income and wealth inequality are multiple and nuanced; but the unintended consequences of the recent unprecedented period of ultra-loose monetary policy deserves a chunk of the blame.
科学家偶尔也会“流氓化 ” ， 放弃科学方法 — — 常常引来臭名或为了追求经济利益 — — 炮制宣传，在缺少专业知识又渴望知情的公众中间散播恐慌。	But scientists occasionally “go rogue,” forsaking the scientific method – often for notoriety or economic gain – to produce propaganda and to sow fear in a public that lacks expertise but is hungry for information.
麦克阿斯基尔承认梅格拉希本人至今对空难都还毫无忏悔，但认为这并不是人们因此拒绝怜悯一个病入膏肓，时日无多的老人的理由。	MacAskill acknowledged that Megrahi himself showed no compassion, but rightly points out that this alone is not a reason to deny him compassion in his final days.
不幸的是，委员会预测的实际国民总收入已经可观的大幅下降仍然高度乐观，因为这样的预测取决于若干不可信和/或有争议的假设。	Unfortunately, the Board’s already-deep projected fall in real GNP is highly optimistic, because it relies on a number of implausible and/or controversial assumptions.
lamp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 一份呈交给德国环境部的研究预计到2020年德国环境技术行业的就业人数将超过汽车工业。	·A study prepared for the German Ministry of Environment estimates that employment in the German environmental technology industries will surpass employment in the automobile industry by 2020.
它们也可能表明一种道出这些东西的人的轻微的倾向，那就是相信某种超自然的支持。 布莱尔离职的决定拖延许久，造成灾难后果。	They may also suggest a slight tendency, on the part of those uttering them, to believe in some kind of supernatural endorsement.
不仅如此，上述管理架构还必须支持有效的风险分担并制定明确的欧元区预算，以此来满足南部欧洲成员国的要求。	Moreover, the framework will need to support more effective risk sharing and a distinct eurozone budget, as the southern member states demand.
我更愿认为这是只有他才能胜任的生命之旅 — — 这是一种诺贝尔委员会在选择他获奖时充分认可的永远年轻的天赋才能。	I like to think that it is this tour de force – this prolonged stroke of genius that is forever young – that the Nobel committee has recognized in its selection.
特朗普现在已经签署了一份行政命令来推翻《清洁能源计划 》 ， 讽刺的是，他声称这样做的目的是要弱化联邦监管，以便让权力回归各州。	Trump has now signed an executive order to roll back the Clean Power Plan, claiming, ironically, that he wants to weaken federal regulations as a way to return power to the states.
但是，当仅仅情况发生时，大规模政策应对措施永远会产生意料外的后果，这些后果常常成为下一场大危机的祸根。	But, when an emergency strikes, large-scale policy responses always produce unintended consequences typically sowing the seeds for the next full-blown crisis.
对于担心更大程度地依赖私人资金会导致曲目编排保守的人士而言，旧金山交响乐团是演奏曲目最富冒险精神的美国乐团之一的事实，也可以使他们放心了。	It also should be reassuring to Europeans who are concerned that greater reliance on private money necessarily means conservative programming that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most adventuresome repertoires in the US.
一上任他就前往深圳朝邓小平雕像致意，三十年前，作为前中共领导人的邓小平在深圳拉开了改革的序幕，让顽固的中共接受了自由市场。	He began his term by paying homage to Deng Xiaoping at his statue in Shenzhen, where, more than three decades ago, the former Communist Party leader had launched the campaign to convert a reluctant Party to free-market reforms.
十年前，根本没人听说过ZIRP（零利率政策 ） 、 QE（量化宽松 ） 、 CE（信用宽松 ） 、 FG（前瞻指引 ） 、 NDR（负存款利率）和UFXInt（无冲销外汇干预）等词汇。	Ten years ago, who had heard of terms such as ZIRP (zero-interest-rate policy), QE (quantitative easing), CE (credit easing), FG (forward guidance), NDR (negative deposit rates), or UFXInt (unsterilized FX intervention)?
为了阻止如雷曼兄弟倒闭这样的事故发生，德国或许会采取足够的行动让欧元生存下来，但欧盟会与曾经颠覆人们想象力的开放社会渐行渐远。	Barring an accident like the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, Germany is likely to do enough to hold the euro together, but the EU will become something very different from the open society that once fired people’s imagination.
如果美国放弃其单方面的颠覆政权要求，与安理会其他成员（包括中俄）合作推进共同方针的话，安理会也可以在叙利亚问题上成为领导者。	It can lead in Syria as well, if the US will set aside its unilateral demand for regime change and work with the rest of the Council, including China and Russia, on a common approach.
通过采用真正可持续的技术，法国、德国和其他国家正在创造一个更能支持世界经济安然度过本世纪的能源体系。	By embracing truly sustainable technologies, France, Germany, and others are creating the energy system that will increasingly support the world economy throughout this century.
但是如果要在全球范围内推广公平竞争，欧洲人的倡议就应该是更大范围的国际努力的一部分，其中还有美国等意趣相投的伙伴和多边机构的参与。	But if fair play is to be made global, European initiatives should be part of broader international efforts, involving both like-minded partners such as the United States and multilateral institutions.
改善一个小学生和中学生数量超过1,600万人的教育体系 — — 比20个欧盟成员国加起来还要多 — — 是一项艰巨的财政挑战。	Improving the education system of a country with more than 16 million primary and secondary school students – more than the combined population of 20 European Union member states – poses considerable fiscal challenges.
相反，尖端研究开创全新工作方式（及未来工作模式 ） ， 这需要新型的知识和技能广泛散布到社会中并改变产品和服务。	Instead, cutting-edge research pioneers new ways of working (and models of future workplaces), which require novel skills and knowledge that will diffuse widely into society and transform production and services.
支持者说，跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）原本将要求越南、马来西亚和文莱大幅改善劳工政策 — — 越南还要支持独立工会。	According to its proponents, the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have required Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei to improve their labor practices significantly – and Vietnam to recognize independent trade unions.
事实上，收入分布最底层10%的人实际工资下降了余额6 % ， 中位员工的实际工资仅仅增长了5—6 % ， 而最顶尖1%员工的实际工资飙升150%以上。	In fact, while real wages fell by about 6% for the bottom 10% of the income distribution and grew by a paltry 5-6% for the median worker, they soared by more than 150% for the top 1%.
这意味着通过发行更多JGB来增加政府支出，由日本银行负责购买 — — 这又称为“直升飞机撒钱 ” 。	That means more government expenditure through more JGB issues, to be purchased by the BOJ – also known as “helicopter money.”
中国企业旷视科技（Face ++）最近完成了4.6亿美元的C轮融资，这是截至目前人工智能领域规模最大的一笔融资。	The Chinese firm Face++ recently raised $460 million, the largest amount ever for an AI company.
根本点仍然是供给和需求：人们比以往更加渴望 — — 事实上，是感到更有力量能够期待 — — 更廉价、更智能、更安全、更高效的工具实现更加“由我做主”的生活。	The bottom line, once again, is supply and demand: More than ever, people want – indeed, feel empowered to expect – cheaper, smarter, safer, and more efficient tools to live a more self-directed life.
即使各种研究 — — 从正规风险评估到“真实世界”观察 — — 都确认转基因技术是安全的，GMO所承受的监管负担仍在不断增长。	Even as study after study – both formal risk assessments and “real-world” observations – has confirmed the technology’s safety, the regulatory burden placed on GMOs has continued to grow.
全球在线课程是方兴未艾的信息革命的一部分 — — 这一个名正在重塑高等教育格局，其最重要的特征是为全世界更多的人创造了获得高等教育的渠道。	Online global courses are part of the world’s ongoing information revolution – a revolution that is now fundamentally reshaping higher education, most importantly by creating new avenues of access for more people around the world.
但在危机后的经济下行区间，累积的债务就会起到一个强大的遏制作用，因为过度杠杆化的企业和消费者都减少投资和消费以偿还贷款。	But in the post-crisis downswing, accumulated debts have a powerful depressive effect, because over-leveraged businesses and consumers cut investment and consumption in an attempt to pay down their debts.
这种不平衡状况已促使一些政府提高退休年龄并修改养老金政策，以延缓或减少福利发放并将老年人留在就业队伍之中。	This imbalance has already driven some governments to raise their retirement ages and change their pension policies to delay or reduce benefits and keep people in the workforce.
幸运的是，我可以找到瑞士智库戈特利布·杜德威勒研究所（Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute）的独立报告支持我的论点。	Fortunately, I can draw on an independent report by the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute (GDI), a Swiss think tank, to support my claim.
在 5月31日, G7 金融和发展部长将在加拿大举行系列会议的第一场会议, 讨论如何可以更公平地分享经济增长。	On May 31, G7 finance and development ministers will hold the first of a series of meetings in Canada to discuss how economic growth can be more equitably shared.
即使在监狱铁窗和他长期经历的24小时监控背后，我一样能想象出他灿烂温和的笑容、快乐的眼神和身上五颜六色的夏威夷衬衫。	Even here, behind prison bars and 24-hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long, I can conjure the warmth of his broad smile, merry eyes, and those colorful Hawaiian-style shirts that he wore with such panache.
无法逃避的讽刺是青少年和年轻女性为增加魅力对晒黑趋之若骛，但这一两次的古铜肤色换来的却是一生皱纹早现、细纹密布和形容枯槁。	The inescapable irony is that teenagers and young women pursue a tan to look more attractive, but trade a moment or two of sunny radiance for a whole lifetime of premature wrinkles, fine lines, and haggard-looking skin.
这显示全球金融体系的核心区域存在巨大的监管“黑洞 ” ， 迄今都没有以货币和金融稳定性为出发点进行密切监控。	This represents a huge regulatory “black hole” at the center of the global financial system, hitherto not closely monitored for monetary and financial stability purposes.
但强大的经济力量 — — 比如科技创新和全球运输成本的下降 — — 才是许多国家不平等性加剧的主要原因。	But powerful economic forces such as technological innovation and lower global transportation costs have been the main drivers of increasing inequality in many countries.
这与埃及几十年来的历史惯例一致 — — 作为穆斯林兄弟会和伊斯兰政治力量得不到合法地位，它们的成员被关押、严刑拷打和流放。	This is consistent with a decades-old pattern in Egyptian history, in which the Brothers – and Islamist political forces in general – were outlawed, and their members imprisoned, tortured, and exiled.
新一期《查理周刊》在封面上又刊登了一幅先知漫画，在巴基斯坦、阿富汗、科威特、黎巴嫩和叙利亚造成反对大游行。	The new issue of Charlie Hebdo, which featured another image of the Prophet on its cover, sparked protest marches in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Tunisia.
但这场战争也点燃了人们爱国情绪¾俄国民众普遍希望恢复俄国昔日的帝国尊严与威望，而普京政权察觉到这种情绪并敏锐地加以利用。	But it is also feeding a patriotic emotion – a popular longing for the restoration of Russia’s imperial status and prestige – that Putin’s regime has shrewdly exploited.
目前，失业率为7.4 % — —在过去12个月中下降了近一个百分点 — — 市场可以预期6.5%的的阈值将在2014年达到。	With the unemployment rate currently at 7.4% – having fallen nearly a full percentage point in the last 12 months – markets can anticipate that the 6.5% threshold could be reached in 2014.
产生了巴拿马文件（Panama Papers）和天堂文件（Paradise Papers）的国际调查便是重要且有趣的新闻的闪光的例子 — — 而重要和有趣乃是所有报道都应该达到的两个基本标准。	The international investigation that led to the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers are brilliant examples of journalism that is relevant and interesting – two fundamental criteria that all reporting should meet.
非洲和国际社会的当务之急就是确保非洲大陆可以挺过全球金融风暴，保持过去十年中取得的巨大成就，并且继续在消除贫困上做出决定性进展。	The priority for Africa and the international community must be to ensure that the continent weathers the global financial storm, preserves the significant achievements of the past decade, and continues to make decisive progress in combating poverty.
而在长期，对全球实力平衡和自由国际秩序 — — 英国在其中有着强大的国家利益 — — 的影响也有将是消极的。	And over the longer run, the effects on the global balance of power and the liberal international order – in which Britain has a strong national interest – would be negative.
另一组国家 — — 葡萄牙、爱尔兰、意大利、希腊和西班牙 — — 的结果就要复杂得多：希腊和葡萄牙债券的收益率飙升，而爱尔兰的收益率直到最近才开始上升。	Another group – Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain (PIIGS) – has had more mixed outcomes: yields have soared on Greek and Portuguese bonds, while Ireland’s were falling until recently.
种子条约缔约国及秘书处还控制着组成国际农业研究磋商小组（CGIAR）的15家研究机构，上述研究合作机制具有全球影响力。	The Seed Treaty also brought under the control of its parties and secretariat the 15 research institutions that comprise the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), an influential global research partnership.
商品出口国（俄罗斯，巴西以及位于中东，亚洲，非洲和拉丁美洲的国家）会因为G7衰退和全球经济放缓致使能源和其他商品价格下降高达30％中受到不利影响。	Commodity exporters (Russia, Brazil, and others in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America) will suffer as the G7 recession and global slowdown drive down energy and other commodity prices by as much as 30%.
由于让借款人避免违约 — — 至少暂时避免 — — 的唯一办法是提供不断增加的流动性，因此，即使银行面临流动性约束，也仍然愿意扩大新贷款。	Given that the only way to enable borrowers to avoid default – at least temporarily – has been to provide an ever-increasing amount of liquidity, even banks facing liquidity constraints have remained willing to extend new loans.
但好社会是这样的：你不必是幸运儿，受到的教育也不会差，吃的食物也不会不健康，做的工作也不会让你感到暗无天日。	But a good society is one in which you do not have to get lucky to avoid a life of poor education, unhealthy food, and dead-end jobs.
在自然基础设施建立了吸引更多公共和私人资本所需要的回溯记录时，慈善资本将在承担相关风险方面起到重要作用。	Philanthropy has an important role to play in bearing the risks involved while natural-infrastructure solutions establish the track record needed to tap larger sources of public and private capital.
欧盟设立了一个科学委员会来对农场中存在的动物福利状况进行调查，而该委员会则建议禁止密集笼箱养鸡以及其他某些形式的监禁式猪/牛饲养方式。	The European Union established a scientific committee to investigate animal-welfare issues on farms, and the committee recommended banning the battery cage, along with some other forms of close confinement of pigs and calves.
因为黑社会的成员既不知道爱国主义也不知道道德为何物，所以他们会很容易就被诱惑成为恐怖分子的同伙，特别是当他们感到受到不公正对待的时候。	Because the denizens of this netherworld know neither patriotism nor morality, they are easily lured into partnership with terrorists, particularly when they have reason to feel aggrieved.
但是，当要在欧盟成员国之间分担排放量削减份额的时候，欧洲委员会在2008一月份提议将基准年从1990年改为2005年。	However, when it came to sharing the burden of emissions reduction among EU member states, the European Commission proposed in January 2008 to change the base year from 1990 to 2005.
投资增加使储蓄对GDP比率下降，随之带来的进口增长降低了贸易盈余对GDP比率，结果中国2009年的外部盈余对GDP比率大幅下滑。	While the increase in investment reduced the saving/GDP ratio, the resulting increase in imports lowered the trade surplus/GDP ratio. As a result, China’s external surplus/GDP ratio fell significantly in 2009.
把戈兰高地交还给叙利亚将会形成以色列边境上的“伊朗据点 ” ， 这不仅在政治上是天真的，而且也是没有理性的。	Any return of the Golan Heights to Syria would result in an “Iranian foothold” on Israel’s border and would thus not only be politically naïve but irrational.
有些人可能忍不住加以抵制 — — 我们亲眼目睹了近期出租车和Uber司机在巴黎爆发的冲突，以及很多国家对这家公司的起诉。	Some might be tempted to resist – witness the recent clashes between taxi and Uber drivers in Paris and the lawsuits against the company in many countries.
不幸的是，事实证明这是错的，直言不讳地说，货币主义者对大萧条的解释在众多方面都是错误的，并且非常不完整。	Unfortunately, this turned out to be the wrong thing to do, as the monetarist interpretation of the Great Depression was, to put it bluntly, wrong in significant respects and radically incomplete.
但在此之前欧洲理事会已经做了很多，不但建立了统一的方针，还将在COP21上将该方针转化为强大的策略和明确的信号。	But it has a lot to do before then, not only to establish a unified approach, but also to translate that approach into strong tactics and a clear message at COP21.
抽样病患中有20%多一点的人（145粒）报告之前曾被诊断为患有双相障碍，这比基于SCID的12.9%的诊断率要高得多。	Slightly more than 20% (145 patients) in our sample reported that they had been previously diagnosed as having bipolar disorder, significantly higher than the 12.9% rate based on the SCID.
顺从的老牌政党的支持率也相应的下跌了 — — 在西班牙，从2009年的81%降至2014年的49 % 。	Support for compliant establishment parties duly collapsed – from 81% in 2009 to 49% in 2014 in Spain.
我父亲是一位货真价实的火箭专家，而照我推测，正如飞机旅行在他那代人的一生中逐渐变得司空见惯那样，太空旅行也会在我这代人的时光中走下神坛。	My father was a (genuine) rocket scientist, and I figured that just as airplanes had become commonplace over the course of his life, space travel would become commonplace over the course of mine.
同样毫不奇怪的是，由于外汇不足，委内瑞拉已很难偿还账单，而价格管制和警察国家监管严重��化了食品短缺。	Nor is it surprising that, with inadequate foreign exchange, the country is having difficulty paying its bills, or that price controls and police-state regulation have severely worsened food shortages.
2012年中国城镇人口占比52.6 % ， 较1980年的18%增长近3倍，且预计到2030年将占比近70 % 。	The urban share of the Chinese population reached 52.6% in 2012 – up nearly three-fold from 18% in 1980, and is expected to rise toward 70% by 2030.
在20—24岁群体中，报告失业率和没有工作、正在寻找的年轻人的百分比（失业比例）之间的区别没有那么明显。	Among those in the 20-24 age group, the difference between the reported unemployment rate and the percentage of youth without a job and looking for one (the unemployment ratio) is less stark.
某些国家在边界内自我封闭的倾向是不合时宜和自暴自弃的，但如果其他国家因为害怕被传染就避免与这些国家接触也是一种严重的错误。	The preference of some countries to isolate themselves within their borders is anachronistic and self-defeating, but it would be a serious mistake for others, fearing contagion, to respond by avoiding engagement with these states.
该国于2003年通过的新宪法要求必须为妇女保留30％的议会席位，并要求各政党确保妇女至少占到选举内部职位的30 ％ 。	In 2003, the country adopted a new constitution that reserves 30% of parliamentary seats for women and requires political parties to ensure that women hold at least 30% of elected internal positions.
这一突变对于继承者来说是一大优势，而随着携带者进入北欧，在农民中间迅速传播，形成了人类历史上扩张最迅速的演化事件之一。	This mutation was a great advantage to those who inherited it, and carriers multiplied among farmers as they swept into Northern Europe, creating one of the fastest-spreading evolutionary event humans have ever experienced.
如果意大利和西班牙产生预算盈余和下降的债务/GDP比率，那么即使欧洲央行不宣布购买计划，金融市场也会降低它们的债券的利率。	If Italy and Spain have budget surpluses and declining debt/GDP ratios, financial markets will reduce the interest rates on their bonds without the proposed ECB purchases.
它们不堪难民涌入的重负，难民数量已达200—400万，并以每个月50,000—100,0000人的数量增加。	They are adversely affected by the flow of refugees, which already numbers 2-4 million and is growing at a rate of 50,000-100,000 per month.
事实上，在波兰，共产主义在布拉格天鹅绒革命发生十年前就开始走向衰败了 — — 1979年教皇约翰·保罗二世首次访问了自己的祖国波兰，他的访问从根本上动摇了波兰共产党的统治。	Indeed, communism’s breakdown began ten years earlier in Poland, during Pope John Paul II’s first pilgrimage to his homeland, a visit that shook communist rule to its foundation.
是的，对中国的赤字是这一失衡的最大组成部分，但这只不过反映了跨国供应链的复杂性和离岸效率方案的益处。	Yes, trade with China is the largest component of this imbalance, but that largely reflects the complexity of multinational supply chains and the benefits of offshore efficiency solutions.
数据分析已经在西非与埃博拉的战争中派上了用场，移动电话网络也已经被用于给整个发展中国家得不到银行服务的人口带去现代银行服务。	Data analysis has been used to fight Ebola in West Africa, and mobile phone networks have been used to bring modern banking to unserved populations throughout the developing world.
但这些这些举措却并未收到明显成效，因为外国投资者都不敢在这个缺乏经济政策可信度并且没有足矣支撑大规模项目的物质和体制基础的国家投资经营。	But these initiatives have yet to yield significant results, with foreign investors wary of operating in a country that lacks both economic-policy credibility and the physical and institutional infrastructure needed to support large-scale projects.
过去所有重大的主权债务危机 — — 包括墨西哥和希腊主权债务危机 — — 都曾带来过债权人、债务人和国际金融机构的规则、法理或战略变化。	All major sovereign-debt crises of the past – including in Mexico and Greece – have generated changes in the rules, jurisprudence, or strategies adopted by debtors, creditors, and international financial institutions.
比较而言，在美国，房地产、保险与退休养老金各占总储蓄的20%左右，存款占7.4 % ， 股票市占21 % ， 债券占33 % 。	To compare, in the United States, real estate, insurance, and pensions each account for about 20% of total savings, with 7.4% in deposits, 21% in stocks, and 33% in bonds.
美元价值的下跌不仅会让中国的外汇储备贬值，还会使美国不愿继续进口便宜的中国商品，而这些便宜的中国货对于中国来说意味着失业和不稳定。	China would not only reduce the value of its reserves as the dollar’s value fell, but it would also jeopardize America’s continued willingness to import cheap Chinese goods, which would mean job losses and instability in China.
这种评价不仅对于贝卢斯科尼而���过于慷慨；而且还有可能使人对特郎普相对于其意大利对手的危险性估计不足。	This assessment is not only far too generous toward Berlusconi; it also risks making it seem that Trump is less dangerous than his Italian counterpart.
比如，全球经济治理计划（Global Economic Governance Initiative）和泛美对话（Inter-American Dialog）逐项目（project-by-project）收集的数据可以为中国对某些拉美经济提的贷款提供一些洞见。	For example, data collected on a project-by-project basis by the Global Economic Governance Initiative and the Inter-American Dialog could provide some insight into Chinese lending to several Latin American economies.
更糟糕的是，当股市于六月上旬开始回调，中国监管机构放宽了限购的限制，同时鼓励国有企业和资产管理者购买更多股票。	Making matters worse, when the current stock-market correction began in early June, Chinese regulators relaxed margin-buying restrictions, while encouraging state-owned enterprises and asset managers to purchase more stocks.
当一个发展中国家陷入无增长均衡时，构建包容性增长的向前看愿景共识永远是迈向实现更好的经济表现和支持这一点的政策的关键的第一步。	When a developing country gets stuck in a no-growth equilibrium, building a consensus on a forward-looking vision for inclusive growth is always the critical first step toward achieving better economic performance and the policies that support it.
如果特朗普提议的税收改革得以全面实施，美元将与美国商品的需求一起受惠：20％的减税将推动美元的价值上升20 ％ 。	If Trump’s proposed tax reforms are implemented in full, the dollar will appreciate along with demand for US goods: a 20% tax cut will push the value of the dollar up by 20%.
在美国企业犯罪调查中，被锁定的美国企业往往会邀请一位著名的人物 — — 前检查官或前法官 — — 去调查行为本身以及涉事人员，并报告给目标企业的董事会。	In American corporate criminal actions, the targeted US firm often brings in a prominent figure – a former prosecutor or a former judge – to investigate the behavior and people involved and report to the target’s board of directors.
信息时代不但给我们提供了新的越来选择；他还打开了窥探邻里生活方式的镜头 — — 而我们看到的是，他们中有些人变得比以前富了很多很多。	The information age has not only provided us with new entertainment options; it has opened new vistas into our neighbors’ lifestyles – and what we have noticed is that some of them are getting much, much richer.
长期以来，悲观论者总是把中国经济与本国经济作比较 — — 重复着耶鲁大学历史学家史景迁（Jonathan Spence）的著名观点在多年前就发出警告的典型错误。	Pessimists have long viewed the Chinese economy as they view their own economies – repeating a classic mistake that Yale historian Jonathan Spence’s seminal assessment warned of many years ago.
事实上，如果一个组织不能采用民主机制来推动内部改革和更新的话，那么整个组织就会走向老化，僵化而且无效率。	Any organization that has not provided democratic mechanisms for change and renewal tends to age and become monotonous and ineffective.
去年，他的政府在政治示威期间关闭了互联网，并宣称要逮捕所有制造或分享“社交媒体上的诽谤或颠覆性材料”的人。	Last year, his government shut down the Internet in the middle of political protests, and vowed to arrest anyone caught generating or sharing “abusive or subversive material on social media.”
这本书力图根据墨西哥和美国两国政府的内部文件、数不清的采访以及对这一问题现有的文献调查来达到三个目的。	Based on internal documents from the Mexican and US governments, countless interviews, and a survey of much of the existing literature on the subject, Ex-Mex seeks to fulfill three purposes.
这一隐性政府担保吸引了更多的钱从无担保渠道流入了有担保渠道，导致更多的“热钱”通过回购协议流入了曼氏金融、雷曼和贝尔斯登这样的公司。	These implicit government guarantees attract more money into these financial channels from nonguaranteed channels, and more “hot money” flows into firms like MF Global, Lehman, and Bear via repo.
中国选择了一条高风险的道路 — — 将人权和联合国制裁置诸脑后 — — 以此来确保本国工业迅速增长所需的能源以及其他资源供应。	China has chosen a high-risk path – ignoring human rights and violating UN sanctions – to secure the energy and other resources needed to sustain its economy’s rapid growth.
有一点可以确定 — — 世界上没有绝对的安全，然后从历史的角度来看，恐怖主义浪潮往往需要一代人的时间才能消退。	To be sure, there is no such thing as perfect safety, and, historically, waves of terrorism have often taken a generation to recede.
当年的英国财相菲利普·斯诺登（Philip Snowden ） — —一个脸庞瘦削、不良于行的小个子，也厉行财政收缩，仿佛是要把英国经济照他自己的模子重新刻一个出来似得。	In Britain back then, Philip Snowden, a small man with a narrow, pinched face, who needed a cane to walk, seemed to want to remake the British economy in his physical image.
以色列、巴勒斯坦和黎巴嫩是旧中东最重要的热点地区，而伊拉克战争之后的地区权力和政治现在是波斯湾的中心议题。	While Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon defined the most important hot spots in the old Middle East, regional power and politics in the wake of the Iraq war is now centered in the Persian Gulf.
结构性预算赤字在民主党总统执政期间（潜在GDP的1.5 % ） 也比共和党执政期间（2.2 % ） 小，尽管这并没有阻止共和党批评民主党支出过度。	The structural budget deficit has also been smaller under Democratic presidents (1.5% of potential GDP) than when Republicans have been in office (2.2%), though this has not stopped Republicans from criticizing Democrats for excessive spending.
作为去年9月联合国实施的可持续发展目标（SDG）的一部分，国际社会承诺到2030年消灭可预防5岁以下儿童死亡。	As part of the Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by the United Nations last September, the international community has pledged to end preventable deaths of children under the age of five by 2030.
西方观察家和国内大部分自由主义者并没有放弃埃尔多安，直到其政府2013年夏对伊斯坦布尔加济公园的示威活动采取严厉镇压的举措。	Western observers and the bulk of domestic liberals did not give up on Erdoğan until his government’s heavy-handed tactics during the Gezi Park protests in Istanbul in the summer of 2013.
一个信誉卓著的新政党 — — 柬埔寨救国党（Cambodia National Rescue Party）在沈良西的领导下崛起（如今，沈良西更像是一位国家领袖，而不是仅仅是一位单纯的反越南斗士 ） ， 获得了大量民众支持。	A credible new opposition party – the Cambodia National Rescue Party – has emerged under Sam Rainsy (who looks a little more like a national leader now than just a monochromatic anti-Vietnamese crusader), gaining significant popular support.
由于语言和文化联系的原因，印度商界自然地在欧洲其他地方中优先选择英国。 但是随着印度投资遍布欧洲大陆各地，就是这一情况也在变化。	Indian businesses naturally chose Britain over other locations in Europe for reasons of language and cultural ties, but even that is changing, as Indian investments spread across the Continent.
在接受国货币并未相对美元升值的情况下，2005－2008年人民币对美元20%的升值无疑对中国增加对外投资起了不可忽视的作用。	The 20% revaluation of the renminbi against the US dollar in 2005-2008 undoubtedly facilitated this in the case of recipient countries whose currencies did not also appreciate against the dollar.
其破坏严重至此并不仅仅是由于行政无能或沿海住宅和商业发展密度增加，相反，它是意料之内的气候变化后果。	The severity of their impact was not merely a product of administrative incompetence or the increased density of coastal residential and commercial development. Rather, it was the predictable result of a changing climate.
经济学家对这一看似合理的方针十分欢迎， 该方针将减缓导致2008—2010年间债务大规模累积的信用扩张。	Economists welcomed this ostensibly reasonable approach, which would slow the expansion of credit that had enabled a massive debt build-up in 2008-2010.
美国的体系可以做到这一点，因为各州都在很大程度上被强制保持预算平衡，而联邦政府则为大部分财政政策负责。	The US system is manageable, because the American states are largely constrained to running balanced budgets, while the federal government accounts for most fiscal policy.
在巩固了“当地现状”后，阿萨德和他的盟友就能向世界呈现一个既成事实：阿萨德仍然大权在握，而不会向反对派作出任何真正让步。	After establishing “facts on the ground,” Assad and his allies would be able to present the world with a fait accompli: Assad remains in power, without making any real concessions to the opposition.
正像新闻评论家安德鲁·苏利文（Andrew Sullivan）所说的那样，还有些人把“富于同情心的保守主义者”理解成一层“烟幕…必须借助它才能在贪得无厌的福利国家里成功地控制政府的权力 。 ”	Still others interpreted “compassionate conservatism,” as the commentator Andrew Sullivan put it, as a “smokescreen...necessary for any vaguely successful retrenchment of government power in an insatiable entitlement state.”
奥巴马在2008年的当选使人们对这一地区也期望颇高，但其政府对拉美的方针至多只能算有所保留，时不时出些昏招。	Barack Obama’s 2008 election created high expectations in this region, too; but his administration’s approach has been reserved, at best, and often obtuse.
纽黑文－在我们揣摩中国5860亿美元经济刺激计划的含义时，思考中国为什么每次在需要促进经济增长的时候，都选择基础设施建设、房屋以及大项目，是很有趣的。	NEW HAVEN – As we digest the implications of China’s $586 billion stimulus plan, it is intriguing to ponder why China chooses infrastructure, buildings, and big projects every time growth needs a boost.
特别是，日本人民和日本政府长期坚持的范式和原则 — — 主权民有、尊重人权和和平等，它们都是日本宪法的基石 — — 是无可质疑的。	In particular, there is no doubt about the norms and principles that our people and our government have long upheld, such as popular sovereignty, respect for human rights, and peace – all pillars of the Japanese constitution.
要制定更具性价比、更全面、更包容的政策，从而让大部分阿富汗人而不是一小撮特权人士受益，美国领导人需要进行一些彻底的反思。	To create more cost-effective, integrated, and inclusive policies that benefit most Afghans, not just the privileged few, US leaders will need to engage in some radical rethinking.
当然，他足够信任该企业，所以让后者能在技术上获取自己公司的营业数据，而企业的服务条款也声明这些数据不会被外人看到或使用。	Of course, he trusted the company enough to grant it technical access to his business data, which the company’s terms of service assure will not be viewed or used.
在不考虑需求的情况下。 这一区间将成为油价的一个天然底部区间 — — 可以将其称之为“页岩底部 ” — —并很可能维持相当长的一段时间。	Regardless of demand, this will be the natural nesting range for the price of oil – call it the “shale shelf” – and will likely remain in place for a protracted period.
不论这些起诉成功与否，目前我们无法再为SEC的披露规则，或美国重新支持建立采掘业的全球透明度标准的态度欢呼雀跃。	Whether or not these prosecutions succeed, for now we can no longer celebrate the SEC’s disclosure rule, or the United States’ renewed support in creating a global standard of transparency for the extractive industries.
我们也不能忘记苏格兰和北爱尔兰，两地压倒多数的民众投票反对英国脱欧，现在似乎准备竭尽全力保住他们在欧洲俱乐部的成员资格。	Nor should we forget the Scots and the Northern Irish, who voted overwhelmingly against Brexit and are now prepared to go to great lengths to preserve their membership in the European club.
的确，中国、印度、巴西、南非以及墨西哥附和其中。 但是，其他许多国家，包括亚洲经济强国和大多数欧洲国家尽管是地球大气的主要污染国家也都没有参与。	To be sure, China, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico signed on; but many countries, including the Asian tigers and most European countries, did not, despite their large contributions to polluting the world’s atmosphere.
第一步应该是确保自然基础设施 — — 决定水的数量、可靠性和质量的河流、含水土层和湿地 — — 能够持续运转。	The first step should be ensuring that the natural infrastructure – the rivers, aquifers, and wetlands that determine the quantity, reliability, and quality of our water – can continue to function.
拉古娜海滩—和许多读者一样，我还能生动地回忆起诺基亚主宰手机市场、占据40%以上份额，而苹果还只是电脑公司的日子。	LAGUNA BEACH – Like many readers, I still vividly recall when Nokia was the dominant player in mobile phones, with over 40% of the market, and Apple was just a computer company.
没有一个脑子正常的店主会用比特币来为自己的商品定价，也没有劳动者想得到一份以特定数量的加密货币来付薪的长期雇佣合同。	No grocer in his right mind would price the goods on his shelves in Bitcoin. No worker would want a long-term employment contract that paid her a fixed number of those units.
但在某一天（我后来才知道是1990年2月11日 ） ， 人们开始不断重复着一句话 ： “ 他自由了，尼尔逊·曼德拉自由了 ！ ”	But, on February 11, 1990, the men began to say repeatedly, “He is free! He is free!
改变世界的梦想掩饰了这场闹剧。 这场闹剧不仅仅如塞万提斯故事中那样影响了个人的命运，也影响了那支受到误导以为自己是传教士的小丑军队。	The dream of improving the world disguised a farce that affected not only a single life, as in Cervantes’ story, and affected not only the misleading army of buffoons believed to be missionaries.
但正如我们不能低估盘踞当地极端派的力量那样，我们也同样不能不去理解这个国家（包括其高层）内部涌动着的那股克制和善意的潮流。	But, just as we cannot afford to underestimate the forces of extremism that persist there, we also fail at our peril to comprehend the currents of restraint and good sense that run within the country, including at high policymaking levels.
纽约 — — 我这一代北美人是听着20世纪70年代“自由自在…表现真我”的儿童唱片长大的，在这张唱片中，伟大的前足球巨星格里尔唱道“哭吧没关系 ” 。	NEW YORK – North Americans of my generation grew up with the 1970’s children’s record “Free to Be...You and Me,” on which Rosey Grier, an immense former football star, sang “It’s Alright to Cry.”
从过去三十年货币浮动可以清除地看出，由市场决定的汇率趋向于长期大幅摇摆游离于让可比商品在不同国家以可比价格销售的同位水平。	It is clear from the last three decades of floating currencies that market-determined exchange rates tend to swing widely and persistently from parity levels that would make comparable goods sell at comparable prices in different countries.
2012年，我的同事和我创设出一种名为PharmaChk的便携式设备，让医生可以用来一些在难以到达的偏远地区检测假冒或者无效的药物。	In 2012, my colleagues and I created PharmaChk, a portable device that doctors can use to detect fake or ineffective medications in hard-to-reach places.
另一方面，伊朗和俄罗斯 — — 它们此前对欧佩克定价的态度就不像沙特阿拉伯那样强硬 — — 现在可能支持更严格的供给约束，原因正是石油价格飙升可能导致针对特朗普的惩罚性反弹。	On the other hand, Iran and Russia, which had previously been less hawkish than Saudi Arabia about OPEC pricing, might now support tougher supply restraints, precisely because a sharp rise in oil prices could cause a punishing backlash against Trump.
Ifo研究所最新的调查显示，德国的建筑和零售行业依旧稳定。 全世界也从这一稳定局面中收益，因为德国是仅次于美国之后的世界第二大商品和服务进口国。	The German construction industry and retailing are still stable, as the latest survey of the Ifo Institute shows, and the whole world is profiting from this stability, as Germany is the second largest importer of goods and services after the US.
与被人民崇拜的昂山素季和睦相处，就像南非种族隔离时期的统治者与纳尔逊·曼德拉（Nelson Mandela）之间的关系，是最重要的决定。	Rapprochement with the iconic Suu Kyi, like that of South Africa’s apartheid-era rulers with Nelson Mandela, was the core decision.
在许多地区，地下水被视为属于采水地土地拥有者的产权，尽管水井用户是在绵亘数千平方英里的含水层上打水。	In many places, underground water is considered the property of the owner of the land where the water is extracted, even when a well’s user is tapping an aquifer that spreads across thousands of square miles.
作者表示：至2050年，全球范围内生活在“高潮水位之下”的人口将新增4000万，届时“水下”总人口也将达到1.5亿。	By 2050, the authors say, a further 40 million people will be living below the high-tide mark, bringing the global total to 150 million.
当米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫谈及“从大西洋直到乌拉尔山的欧洲”时，他脑中所浮现出的并非是一块处于苏联统治下的大陆（正如约瑟夫·斯大林曾经威胁过的那样 ） 。	When Mikhail Gorbachev spoke of a “Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals,” his conception was not of a continent under Soviet domination, as Josef Stalin once threatened.
上世纪30年代的大萧条时期 — — 当时美国经济崩溃，美联储却袖手旁观 — — 是深深烙印在每一个美国中央银行家意识中的固化事件。	The Great Depression of the 1930’s, when the Fed stood idly by as the economy collapsed, is the molding event seared into the consciousness of every American central banker.
因此在回答调查问题时普通英国人可能会更多地考虑这些群体，比如寻求庇护者以及逃离中东和北非冲突的难民。	When answering survey questions, the average Briton may be thinking more about these cohorts than, say, asylum seekers and refugees fleeing from conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa.
今年10月贝•布托流放归来被看作是挽救这个国家于危险分裂的曙光；而她的遇刺则让那些美好的愿望再次破灭。	Her return from exile in October was seen as a step toward curbing the country’s dangerous fragmentation; her murder shatters those hopes.
相反，其陆路和海路铜带可能吸引大量投资进入沿途国家 — — 特别是来自中国的投资，中国正在寻找新途径部署其为数巨大的储备。	On the contrary, its overland and maritime routes could attract considerable investment to participating countries – especially from China, as it seeks new avenues for deploying its vast reserves.
当时我以澳大利亚外交部长的身份访问以色列，主要目的是讨论奥斯陆和平协议的快速实施问题，也就是讨论接受巴勒斯坦建国的问题。	I was visiting Israel as Australia’s foreign minister to argue the case for rapid implementation of the Oslo peace accords – all the way through to negotiated acceptance of Palestinian statehood.
随后，他在国大党的衣钵继承者拉奥（Narasimha Rao）和辛格（Manmohan Singh）继续发动改革，让印度进入了充满自信的新时代，增长繁荣，社会经济活力四射。	Then, following reforms initiated by his successors atop the Indian National Congress, Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh, India entered a confident new era of flourishing growth and socioeconomic dynamism.
150年前的1862年，亚伯拉罕·林肯创造了“政府授地 ” （ land-grant）大学，以帮助当地社区通过科学改善农业和生活质量。	Exactly 150 years ago, in 1862, Abraham Lincoln created America’s “land-grant” universities to help local communities to improve farming and the quality of life through science.
自邓小平以来，后毛泽东时代的政治制度一直严格保证最高层官员的人身安全，从而避免重蹈毛泽东时代内部权力之争演变为你死我活的斗争、没有人真正安全的覆辙。	Beginning with Deng Xiaoping, the post-Mao regime has worked hard to ensure the physical security of its top officials, thereby avoiding Mao’s mistake of turning internal power struggles into life-and-death contests in which nobody is safe.
除非他们能够升级自己的知识和技能 — — 在某些情况中，还要进入新的行业和地区 — — 否则他们的经济机会将受到限制。	Unless they can upgrade their knowledge and skills – and, in some cases, move to a new industry or location – they face constrained economic opportunities.

叙利亚国内讨论的主要问题是复兴伊斯兰教，替代政治经济体制，但这一动议除了达官显贵外很难引起别人的兴趣。	A major item of discussion in Syria is the revival of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system offering few incentives except to regime grandees.
哥伦比亚政府如此开创性的做法似乎也离不开性别小组委员会的工作，该委员会负责审议提案，对代表女性及同性恋群体利益的非政府机构提案展开审议进程。	The Colombian government’s pioneering approach seems to have benefited from a gender sub-commission that considered proposals from nongovernmental organizations representing women’s rights and the LGBT community.
过去六十年中，美国一直在保护韩国和日本，它由充分的理由 — — 和手段 — — 要求这两个差昂起盟友加强彼此的军事合作。	After spending the last six decades defending South Korea and Japan, the US has every reason – and plenty of leverage – to demand that its two long-time allies enhance their military cooperation.
纽约 — — 2015年，几乎全部来自发展中国家的约590万5岁以下儿童死于可以轻松预防或治疗的原因。	NEW YORK – In 2015, around 5.9 million children under the age of five, almost all in developing countries, died from easily preventable or treatable causes.

土耳其族的北塞浦路斯接受了联合国秘书长科菲·安南解决长期冲突的计划（该计划得到欧盟的大力支持 ） 。	Turkish Northern Cyprus accepted UN Secretary General Kofi Annan’s plan (massively supported by the EU) to resolve the long-standing conflict.
诸如“木结构”以及“美”这样的观念，都是通过符号 — — 当这些符号组合起来时，可以产生一个新的概念，例如“形 ” — —来加以显示的。	Notions such as “wooden structure” and “beauty” were indicated by symbols which, when combined, could create a new concept, such as “form.”
总的来说，越多人使用一种毒品，那么滥用者的数目也会随之增加（这是基于一种合理假设：全体吸食者中必定存在有特定比例的滥用者，其数量随总吸食者的增加而增加 ） 。	In general, the more people who use a drug, the larger the number of problem users there will be (on the reasonable assumption that problem users comprise a fixed proportion of all users).
然而普京照样牢牢控制着国家，而且十有八九能在2018年3月举行的总统选举中再次打造出一场压倒性胜利。	Yet Putin has been able to remain firmly in control and, in all likelihood, will easily be able to engineer another landslide victory in the presidential election due in March 2018.
事实上，根据麦肯锡公司的统计，非洲是2009年世界经济增长的第三大贡献者，非洲的贡献仅次于中国和印度。	Indeed, according to McKinsey & Company, Africa was the third-largest contributor to world economic growth in 2009, after China and India.
首先是美国人口普查局的年度收入和贫困报告，该报告显示，尽管美国经济被认为已从大衰退中复苏，但普通美国人的收入仍然处于停滞状态。	The first, the US Census Bureau’s annual income and poverty report, shows that, despite the economy’s supposed recovery from the Great Recession, ordinary Americans’ incomes continue to stagnate.
国际货币基金组织于20世纪60年代创立特别提款权(SDRs ) ， 就是因为世界各国认识到了这一根本问题。	Recognition of this fundamental problem was the reason why the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) were created in the 1960’s.
此外还需要解决严重的过度负债问题 — — 没完没了的希腊危机突出了这一点 — — 该问题的破坏性影响远远不局限于直接受害者。	There is also a need, highlighted by the protracted Greek crisis, to address pockets of severe over-indebtedness, which can have crushing impact extending well beyond the directly affected.
如果哈梅内伊迅速攫紧权力，穆斯维就难以到总统之位，但他至少还继续承载着那些与政府意见相左的大多数伊朗人的期望。	If Khamenei holds fast, Mousavi cannot gain the presidency, but he will continue to represent the hopes of the majority of Iranians who differ dramatically with their government.
为了满足全球每年720万吨巧克力的需求量，好时公司等跨国企业需要数百万个可可农场，每个农场的种植面积都相当小，通常为1—2公顷。	To meet global demand for 7.2 million metric tons of chocolate annually, multinationals like Hershey rely on millions of cocoa farmers, each of whom farms a tiny plot, often 1-2 hectares (2.5-5 acres).
一美元银行贷款可以增加一美元货币供给，因此，银行并非金融中介（intermediary ） ； 而是货币创造者。	Given that a dollar in new bank loans increases the money supply by a dollar, banks are not financial intermediaries; they are money creators.
考虑到这些不足之处，必须在对法律界人士，政府官员和政策制订者们的核心培训和继续教育中加入关于科学工程以及其社会应用的内容。	Given such shortcomings, courses on science and engineering and their social applications should become part of the core training and continuing education of those in law, public administration, and official policymaking positions.
另有三分之一的学生的政治立场正好相反，他们认为美联储前主席艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）是罪魁祸首。	Another third, at the opposite end of the political spectrum, saw former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan as the villain.
在这方面，中国可以从西方普通法体系（循例断案）中汲取有益经验，也可以从行政诉讼法庭解决官民纠纷的做法汲取有益经验。	Here, China can take inspiration from the Western common law system, in which cases are decided on the basis of existing precedents, or from the use of administrative courts to resolve disputes between individuals and the bureaucracy.
此外无形资本重要性也在日益增加：美国当局最近将GDP向上修正了4000亿美元，原因是研发支出应该被确认为投资。	Furthermore, immaterial capital increasingly matters, too: US authorities recently revised GDP upward by $400 billion after recognizing that research and development spending should be categorized as investment.
更深层次的原因是当前的自动化前景预示着，对许多此前被认为专属于人类的工作岗位，未来也极有可能被机器取代。	The more profound reason is that current automation prospects herald a future in which machines can plausibly replace humans in many spheres of work where it was thought that only we could do the job.
一些分析家将1945年后的时期称为美国领导的、以自由为特征的层级秩序，其中美国提供公共品并在弱国也能赢得话语权的松散的多边规则和机构体系中施展。	Some analysts describe the post-1945 period as a US-led hierarchical order with liberal characteristics, in which the US provided public goods while operating within a loose system of multilateral rules and institutions that gave weaker states a say.
但如果参议院通过上述法案并交由总统签署，其影响很可能远远超出气候变化的范畴，致使官员无法利用纳税人资助的能源部研究成果为美国民众提供保护。	But if the bill is passed by the Senate and signed by the president, its implications would likely extend far beyond climate change, with officials unable to use any taxpayer-funded DOE research to protect US citizens.
超过两千万埃及民众，其中也包括许多小企业主，现在已经开始使用这项服务，该系统现在每天能够处理150万次支付。	More than 20 million Egyptians, including many small business owners, now use the service, which processes 1.5 million payments daily.
马尼拉 - - 巴基斯坦总统穆沙拉夫去年宣布实行戒严以及前总理贝布托遇刺身亡引发巴基斯坦政局混乱，在整个东南亚造成了海啸般的影响。	MANILA -- Pakistan’s near political chaos, the result of President Pervez Musharraf’s declaration of martial law last year and the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, has had a tsunami-like impact across Southeast Asia.
唯有通过这些一体化战略，决策者才能拿出足够的政策凝聚力，实现每一项政策的效率最大化并为私人部门的参与树立信心。	Only with such integrated strategies can policymakers offer the level of policy coherence needed not just to maximize the effectiveness of each policy, but also to instill confidence in the private sector to do its part.
在全球化的世界中，权力可能越发看似梦幻一般，但是，他人也有这一幻觉，而且某人怀有这种幻觉时间越长，其身边的人就越发具有相同的信念。	Power may be increasingly illusory in a globalized world, but it is an illusion that is shared by others, and the longer one inhabits it, the more one’s circle consists of others who share the belief.
剑桥 - - 在一年一度的瑞士达沃斯世界经济论坛上所发表的演讲中，中国总理温家宝阐释了他的政府采用公共开支和贷款来应对全球经济危机的计划。	CAMBRIDGE – Addressing the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao explained his government’s plans to counter the global economic meltdown with public spending and loans.
在她以往所承担的各类公共角色以及随后作为总理的那13年中，默克尔一直保持着一种与其学术出身契合的有条不紊且注重反思的行事风格。	In her various public roles, and throughout 13 years as chancellor, Merkel has always maintained a methodical and reflective style that suits her scientific background.
网络战已经成为日常现实；事实上，在任意时刻，北约国家都会受到网络攻击，有可能触发北约的共同防务担保机制。	Cyber warfare is already a daily reality; indeed, at any moment, a cyber-attack could be launched against a NATO country, potentially triggering the alliance’s mutual-defense guarantee.
成功的发展来自当地确定、检验和坚持的方法，而并非来自西方机构和技术专家花费大量金钱制定的自上而下的分配策略。	Development is most successful when it emerges from solutions that are identified, tested, and sustained locally, not when Western agencies and technocrats spend huge sums on top-down approaches.
德克萨斯州大学城 — — 将战争和个人罪恶混为一谈如果不是现代国际政治中人们的共同选择，也无疑已经成为一种普遍现象。	COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS – Equating war with individual evil has become ubiquitous – if not universal – in contemporary international politics.
在某种程度上，Xtify与韦瑞奇的另一间公司MeetMoi堪称遥相呼应。 而MeetMoi则是一家借助移动电话定位技术和兴趣分析来帮用户找到志趣相投者的实时约会网站。	To some extent, Xtify is an echo of Weinreich’s other venture, MeetMoi, a real-time dating site that uses mobile-phone location technology and interest profiles to help users find like-minded strangers.
朴茨茅斯 — — 切尔诺贝利核事故已经过去了近三十年，科学界仍在就辐射对反应堆周围生态系统造成的影响争论不休。	PORTSMOUTH – Nearly 30 years have passed since the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, and the scientific community is still arguing about the impact radiation is having on the ecosystem surrounding the reactor.
通过教育和预防、医疗卫生服务能力建设和新型合作，我们可以继续改善新疆和其他地区的医疗卫生服务覆盖，提高整个发展中世界的福利。	With education and prevention, capacity-building, and new kinds of partnerships, we can continue to improve access to health care in Xinjiang and beyond, boosting well-being throughout the developing world.
作为一名狡猾的恐惧贩子，他必定能将协议作为世界孤立和遗弃以色列的进一步证据，从而充分利用公众焦虑强化对其政府的政治支持。	A crafty fear monger, he will be able to present the agreement as further proof of Israel’s isolation and abandonment by the world, enabling him to leverage public anxiety into enhanced political support for his government.
一个称为贝叶斯定理的统计公式将显示民众对民意测验中的信任度会从 50%增至 67 % ， 而专家意见的信誉则由50%下降到33 % 。	A statistical formula called Bayes’ theorem then shows that belief in opinion polls would increase from 50% to 67%, while the credibility of expert opinion would fall from 50% to 33%.
经验表明，在某一点上 — — 通常是人均收入达到15,000—20,000美元（约为美国水平的三分之一）时 — — 增长开始趋缓。	Experience shows that there is a point – usually when per capita income levels reach about $15,000-20,000 (roughly one-third the level in the United States) – when growth tends to slow.
电影里，这些士兵被描述为是受他们的领导人 — — 这些人运用恶毒的种族主义和宗教嘲讽 — — 所指挥而对当地毫无侵略性的“敌人”展开无情的攻击。	The soldiers are portrayed as being manipulated by their leaders – through vicious racism and religious derision – into brutal action against the non-aggressive “hostiles.”
亚洲有很多能力很强的经济官员，都值得考虑作为下任 IMF 总裁的人选。 但如果要选择他们中的任何一个人，都不应仅仅因为他 / 她是亚洲人。	Asia has plenty of competent economic officials who might be considered as the next managing director of the IMF. But just because they are Asian is not reason enough to select them.
工资增长停滞不前为企业带来了盈利，但与此同时消费的停滞，服务部门的僵化以及以及对新企业的压制却压抑了国内投资，于是所有的盈余都被投向了国外。	Stagnant wages boost corporate surpluses, while subdued spending, a stifled service sector, and stunted start-ups suppress domestic investment, with the resulting surplus savings often squandered overseas.
2016年，尼日利亚财政部长呼吁西方停止试图阻止非洲利用煤炭来解决其能源短缺问题的“虚伪行动 ” 。	In 2016, the Nigerian finance minister called out the West for its “hypocrisy” in attempting to block Africa from using coal to solve its power shortages.
至于流动性，从表面上来看似乎更强了，但是美国证券交易委员会和美国商品期货交易委员关于“闪电崩盘”所做的联合报告表明高频交易的交易员大幅减少了流动性，导致问题更加严重。	There are lessons here for regulators. First, their monitoring of markets requires a quantum leap in sophistication and speed.
卡特居认为谈判必然重启的原因是美国的“战略绝望 ” ， 这种绝望极其强烈，以至于如果找到与基地组织的联系，美国甚至不可能兑现克里取消谈判的承诺。	Katju attributes the talks’ inevitable resumption to America’s “strategic desperation,” which is so acute that the US would be unlikely even to follow through on Kerry’s pledge to call off the talks if any link to Al Qaeda were found.
另一种情况是：利率上涨、房地产市场衰落可能会严重减弱消费需求，使经济滑坡，直至萧条，给依赖于美国市场的其它国家的出口商造成巨大压力。	Alternatively, rising interest rates and a downturn in the real estate market could so weaken consumer demand that the economy slips into recession, squeezing exporters in other countries that depend on the US market.
随着政府日益感到压力要采取行动遏制气候变化，化石燃料需求可能降低，而这可能导致价格被抑制的时间长于行业预期 — — 也许将永无翻身之日。	As pressure grows on governments to take action to combat climate change, demand for fossil fuels is likely to drop, which could result in prices remaining depressed for longer than the industry anticipates – perhaps forever.
通过欧洲刑警组织以及欧洲司法组织，欧洲的警察和司法机关加强了合作，而各国部长们准备允许其他欧盟国家的执法机构接触各国的DNA和指纹数据库。	Through Europol and Eurojust, European police forces and judicial authorities have intensified cooperation, and ministers are preparing to grant law enforcement agencies of other EU countries access to national databases of DNA and fingerprints.
这一认识使美国决策者不愿意支持阿拉伯之春起义，奥巴马在干预利比亚方面的犹豫以及（至少从目前看）不愿直接卷入叙利亚血腥的内战即是明证。	This recognition has already dampened US policymakers’ support for the Arab Spring uprisings: witness Obama’s hesitation to intervene in Libya and his unwillingness, at least so far, to involve America directly in Syria’s bloody civil war.
在大多数发达国家家庭刚刚实现通电，从无线电到冰箱等电子设备进入家庭的时候，电力激发了最为迷人的高科技想象。	At a time when most households in advanced countries had only recently been electrified, and electric devices from radios to refrigerators had entered homes, electricity evoked images of the most glamorous high science.
确定诸多农产品底价以及确保墨西哥产量和消费量相吻合归根结底与北美贸易协定的诸多条款背道而驰 — — 而且与特朗普减少美国双边贸易赤字的目标相抵触。	Establishing floor prices for many agricultural products, and ensuring that Mexico produces what it consumes, runs counter to many NAFTA provisions – and to Trump’s goal of reducing the bilateral US trade deficit.
更广泛地说，2060年的零碳全球经济所消费的电量将是今天的20,000万亿瓦时的4—5倍，为数十亿人提供更好的交通服务、空调和更清洁的取暖。	More broadly, a zero-carbon global economy in 2060 would probably consume 4-5 times as much electricity as today’s 20,000 TW hours, delivering improved transport services, air conditioning, and cleaner heating to billions of people.
近几年来有个魔咒，即，不管全球经济增、大宗商品或金融市场长发生什么扭曲或转折 ， “ 新兴市场的故事总能岿然不动 。 ”	One mantra of recent years has been that, whatever the twists and turns of global economic growth, of commodities or of financial markets, “the emerging-economy story remains intact.”
但就连该校最狂热的支持者（该校的支持者不乏其人）也无法确定如果被禁止自主招生，该校是否还能取得同样的优异成绩。	Not even the school’s most enthusiastic boosters – of which there are many – could argue with any certainty that it could produce such impressive results if it could not select its own students.
马纳福特显然明白他既不能指望中期选举结束后能得到赦免 — — 如果特朗普本人到那时都陷入到严重的法律危险之中呢？	Manafort apparently calculated that he could neither bet on a pardon later – what if Trump himself was in serious legal danger by then? – nor afford another trial.
内塔尼亚胡自己也坚持“坚不可摧”的安全安排，这无非是以色列出现在约旦河谷 — — 并且再也不回1967年“奥斯维辛边界”的委婉说法。	Netanyahu’s own insistence on “ironclad” security arrangements is a euphemism for an Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley – and no return to the “Auschwitz borders” of 1967.
长期担任沙特石油部长的雅曼尼（Sheikh Zaki Yamani）早在20世纪80年代就知道了这一点 ： “ 石器时代结束的原因 ， ” 他警告他的同胞 ， “ 不是原始人把石头都用光了 。 ”	Sheikh Zaki Yamani, the longtime Saudi oil minister, knew this back in the 1980s. “The Stone Age did not end,” he warned his compatriots, “because the cavemen ran out of stone.”
此外，在整个欧洲，禁忌的缺失以及人为事事可评论、人人可攻讦的观念导致了种族主义事件的增加，尽管从表面上看无不是孤立事件。	And, throughout Europe, the loss of taboos and the belief that anything can be said – and anyone insulted – has led to an increase in racist incidents that are only superficially isolated.
瓦格宁根，荷兰 — — 诞生于1957年的共同农业政策（CAP）如今已年逾五旬，欧盟委员会正提议对它这位中年后代进行所谓的体检。	WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS – Born in 1957, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is now more than 50 years old, and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child.
2004年，法国人比美国人人均工作时间少28 ％ ， 德国人和荷兰人少25 ％ ， 而他们挣的钱也就相应比美国人少。 他们的人均收入几乎要比美国人低30 ％ 。	In 2004, the French worked 28% fewer hours per person than Americans, and the Germans and Dutch each put in 25% fewer hours, and the money they earned was correspondingly lower—almost 30% less income per person than Americans received.
但是，对大部分新兴市场国家来说，2003—2011年期间的名义GDP增长来自贸易条件改善、资本流入和实际升值。	For most emerging-market countries, however, nominal GDP growth in the 2003-2011 period was caused by terms-of-trade improvements, capital inflows, and real appreciation.
日本银行已经持有相当于该国GDP总额40%的政府债券，并承诺在首相安倍晋三的经济激活进程框架下每年购入相当于GDP总额16%的债券。	The Bank of Japan already holds government securities worth 40% of GDP, and it is committed to annual purchases worth 16% of GDP within the framework of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic revitalization agenda.
坎布里奇 — — 随着被外界广为期待和猜测的美联储在美启动短期利率上调的日子越来越近，很多人都无法确定新兴市场经济将受到哪些冲击。	CAMBRIDGE – As the Federal Reserve moves closer to initiating one of the most long-awaited and widely predicted periods of rising short-term interest rates in the United States, many are asking how emerging markets will be affected.
2005年以来，美国国会一再与立法者演双簧，试图将压力重重的美国工人从假定的廉价人民币的威胁中解救出来。	Since 2005, the US Congress has repeatedly flirted with legislation aimed at defending hard-pressed American workers from the presumed threat of a cheap Chinese currency.
中国、日本，印度和东盟的年度GDP总和已经达到了14.45万亿美元，与美国的14.62万亿美元旗鼓相当。	The combined annual GDP of China, Japan, India, and ASEAN is $14.45 trillion, roughly equal to that of the United States, at $14.62 trillion.
世界银行不向尼日利亚发放美元贷款，而是用石油价格来为贷款标价，同时发行相同数量用石油计价的债券，以此消除世界石油价格波动的风险。	Instead of denominating a loan to Nigeria in terms of dollars, the Bank would denominate it in terms of the price of oil and lay off its exposure to the world oil price by issuing that same quantity of bonds denominated in oil.
这种转移支付从就不是这一经济和货币联盟的特点，欧洲央行显然也不具备强制推动该联盟根本性变革的职权 — — 尤其是在这些变化只有利于一个国家集团的情况下。	Such transfers were never supposed to be a feature of the Economic and Monetary Union, and it is clearly not within the ECB’s mandate to force fundamental changes to the EMU system – especially if those changes favor one group of countries.
印度和尼泊尔的合作社计划通过协调种植，让每个参与者的庄稼都可以用机器统一播种和收割，不再像以前那样需要人工操作。	By coming together to coordinate planting, cooperatives in India and Nepal have made it possible for every member’s crops to be sown and harvested together by a machine, rather than individually by hand.
即使众议院真的弹劾特朗普 — — 能不能弹劾现在还根本无法确定 — — 要想在参议院将他定罪也将是极其困难的。	Even if the House were to impeach Trump – no sure thing – convicting him in the Senate would be extremely difficult.
2016年的错位与混乱和葛兰姆西写《狱中笔记》的两次大战之间无法相提并论，但也显然是权力真空的症候。	The dislocation and confusion of 2016 do not rival the turmoil of the interwar period, when Gramsci wrote, but they are certainly symptoms of a new interregnum.
中日两国的领导人需要接受自身在该进程中所处的位置，而且最重要的是，不要仅仅着眼于当前事件的一些旁枝末节之上。	Leaders of both China and Japan need to accept their position in this process and, above all, not simply ride on the froth of current events.
让公众怒不可遏的是关于印度超级联赛（IPL）的耸人听闻的指控 — — 贿赂比赛、球队老板赌球、球手被三版女郎引诱。	Instead, the public has been outraged by lurid accusations concerning the Indian Premier League (IPL) – bribes for bad play, owners betting on games, and players seduced by starlets and call girls.
另一方面，观察者们预期特朗普所实施的一些对美元起支持作用的措施，如钢铁进口关税，正在成为现实，不管你喜不喜欢。	Working in the other direction is the fact that some of the dollar-supportive measures that observers expected Trump to adopt, such as tariffs on steel imports, are now coming, like it or not.
为保护欧洲凝聚力 、改善各国的经济发展局面，法国和意大利必须以比德国更快的步伐推进改革，而不是等待德国慢下来。	To protect European cohesion as well as improve their own economic situation, France and Italy must reform at a faster pace than Germany rather than just waiting for Germany to slow down.
自 2003 年始，欧盟就开始声称自己也可以独立行动，并执行了 23 次欧洲防务和安全任务，其中还有 6 次是重大的军事行动。	The EU has since 2003 begun to assert itself operationally as well, carrying out 23 ESDP missions, six of which have been significant military operations.

“市场波动与环境周期非常不契合 ， ” 麻省理工学院的加内尔·诺克斯-海耶斯（Janelle Knox-Hayes）指出 ， “ 经济体系花点时间就能从市场动荡中恢复。	“Market volatility is ill suited to environmental cycles,” as MIT’s Janelle Knox-Hayes puts it. “Economic systems recover from market turmoil in time.
但是，随着2014年的深入，出现了令人担忧的比较 — — 不是和1914年，而是一些两次大战之间的更凶险的特点。	But, as it progressed, disturbing parallels appeared – not to 1914, but to some of the nastier features of the interwar years.
她数次因腐败被指控，但没有被定罪，其中一个广为人知的案件涉及在泰姬陵附近建造一个大型购物中心，这违反了景观规划法。	She has been accused, but not convicted, of corruption several times, with one notable case involving the construction of an elaborate shopping complex near the Taj Mahal, in violation of zoning laws.
尽管如此，对于我们这些居住在美国（以及其他发达国家）的人来说 — — 在接下来的一个世纪里气温变暖可能还不是个大问题。	Still, for those of us in the United States – and the Global North generally – warming temperatures probably won’t be that big a problem over the next century. Essentially, the climate will creep north about three miles each year.
牛津 — — 在法国最近召开的一次会议上，一些欧洲人提出美国总统唐纳德·特朗普可能对欧洲发展有益的观点令美国客人非常惊讶。	OXFORD – At a recent conference in France, a number of Europeans surprised their American guests by arguing that US President Donald Trump might be good for Europe.
在已经非常脆弱的阿拉伯地区，像伊拉克这样的主要国家如果陷入内乱，就很可能招来邻国的不安和干预，这样的邻居可谓比比皆是。	In an already fragile region, a major Arab country like Iraq would most likely prompt interventions by its nervous neighbors - of which there is no shortage - if it turns into a failed state.
但他们还没有占据多数，而认为西方可能即将面临“阿拉伯化”或“伊斯兰化”危险的想法还远远没有成为主流。	But they are not yet in the majority, and the belief that the West is in imminent danger of being “Arabized” or “Islamized” is not quite yet mainstream.
吸取额外的教训则需要回溯到2011年，当时和平反政府示威者遭遇血腥镇压，导致美国总统奥巴马和其他人要求阿萨德下台。	Deriving additional lessons requires going back to 2011, when peaceful anti-government protesters were met with deadly force, leading US President Barack Obama and others to demand that Assad step down.
然而，随着科索沃的阿尔巴尼亚族大多数要求建立自己的国家，及俄罗斯拒绝承认联合国斡旋者Martti Ahtisaari提出的有条件独立计划，美国决定单独采取行动了。	But, with Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian majority demanding its own state, and with Russia refusing to recognize UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari’s plan for conditional independence, the US is preparing to go it alone.
最后，即使在伊朗核计划问题上有了逐步解决的过程，仍然需要更广泛的讨论以解决对地区稳定构成威胁的非核问题。	Finally, even with step-by-step progress on Iran’s nuclear program, broader discussions are needed to address the many non-nuclear issues that threaten regional stability.
全世界许多希望现在都指向了以对一个政治家来说非常高的道德主张开始总统任期的巴拉克·奥巴马总统，当然，奥巴马不是救世主；他不能创造奇迹。	Many hopes throughout the world are now directed toward President Barack Obama, who enters his presidency with a moral claim that is extraordinarily high for a politician. Of course, Obama is not the Messiah; he cannot work miracles.
在战后时期，市场驱动的繁荣证明任何附带社会痛苦都是合理的这一顺境观点被视为理所当然；它还形成了有钱阶级及其意识形态支持者之间的共识。	During the post-war period, the fair-weather argument that market-driven prosperity justifies any collateral social pain was taken as a given; it also came to define the consensus view among the moneyed class and its ideological backers.
如此，如果所在国退出欧盟，这些投资者将获益，因为存放在德国银行的余额相比仍然以欧元计价，即使欧元区解体，也可以转换为坚挺的“新德国马克 ” 。	That way, these investors would benefit if their country left the currency union, because balances with a German bank presumably would remain in euro, or in rock-solid “neue Deutsche Mark” should the eurozone break up.
毕竟这些地方是亚马逊、苹果、Facebook、谷歌、英特尔、微软和三星的总部所在地，这些公司的创新改变了从金融服务到同新传媒各个行业的业务模式。	After all, they are the homes of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Samsung – companies whose innovations transform the way other sectors, from financial services to telecoms and media, do business.
但拉宾的副手给了佩雷斯给了佩雷斯一个机会，由他组织在奥斯陆与巴勒斯坦解放组织进行备选方案（track two）谈判，并在拉宾的批准下担任谈判负责任，并在1993年8月成功达成协议。	But Peres was offered by Rabin’s deputy an opportunity to champion a track two negotiation with the PLO in Oslo, and, with Rabin’s consent, took charge of the talks, bringing them to a successful conclusion in August 1993.
欧元区成员国之间的竞争力差距有所缩小，欧元区内部外部失衡有所减轻，但主要原因是南欧内需受到抑制；从北向南流动的储蓄流没有恢复。	Competitiveness gaps between eurozone members have diminished, and external imbalances within it have abated, but largely thanks to the compression of domestic demand in Southern Europe; saving flows from North to South have not resumed.
第三，特朗普政府与中国、欧洲、墨西哥，加拿大和其他国家的贸易争端升级几乎是板上钉钉的事情，导致经济增长放缓和通胀上升。	Third, the Trump administration’s trade disputes with China, Europe, Mexico, Canada, and others will almost certainly escalate, leading to slower growth and higher inflation.
事实上，就在最新事态爆发前不到两个星期，印度总理曼莫汉·辛格刚刚在纽约召开的联合国大会上与巴基斯坦总理纳瓦兹·谢里夫进行了会面。	Indeed, barely two weeks before the latest incident, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, during the United Nations General Assembly session in New York.
自20世纪上半叶以来 — — 趋势明确则是自保罗二世即位（1978—2005）以来 — — 意大利和欧洲国家垄断受祝福者的局面被打破。	Since the early part of the twentieth century – and, most clearly, since John Paul II’s papacy (1978-2005) – the traditional dominance of Italy and other European countries in the locations of blessed persons has waned.
1931年的“满洲里事件”最终导致日本占领东北三省，日本商人召妓正发生在该事件72周年纪念日。 在一个互联网民意测验中90%的投票者表示他们坚信日本商人是故意要籍此羞辱中国。	Occurring on the 72nd anniversary of the 1931 Mukden Incident that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, 90% of Chinese respondents to an Internet poll said they believed that the Japanese businessmen intended to humiliate China.

美国摧毁了作为制约性的地区力量的伊拉克，从而给其传统上的海湾盟国以强烈的一击，因为伊拉克是伊朗的野心的障碍。	By destroying Iraq as a counterbalancing regional force, the US dealt a major blow to its traditional Gulf allies, for whom Iraq served as a barrier against Iran’s ambitions.
埃博拉、基孔肯雅、寨卡和此前非典及中东呼吸综合征等传染病的出现凸显了公共卫生系统快速组建防御体系的能力不足。	The emergence of infectious diseases (like Ebola, chikungunya, Zika, and, previously, SARS, swine flu, and MERS) typically highlights the inadequate capacity of public-health systems to build up defenses quickly.
世卫组织的所作所为受到了广泛的批评：如欧洲理事会议会大会就在1月12日提出计划在本月下旬就“威胁健康的虚假流行病”展开讨论。	The WHO’s performance has been widely criticized: the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, for example, said on January 12 that it plans to debate “false pandemics, a threat to health” later this month.
在工业化最初的一段时间，瓦特陷入了财务困境，直到与英国制造商马修·布尔顿（ Matthew Boulton）合伙之前，他的蒸汽机一直都无法成功实现商业化。	At the very outset of industrialization, Watt struggled financially and did not successfully commercialize his steam engine until he formed a partnership with the English manufacturer Matthew Boulton.
尽管任何一届未来的美国政府都可能出于安全原因反对伊朗的民用核计划，但美国的政策制定者们也应该承认核能对稳定伊朗政权会产生的战略影响。	While there may be security reasons for any future US administration to oppose even a civilian nuclear program, American policymakers also recognize the strategic impact that nuclear energy will have in stabilizing the Iranian regime.
欧元区小国的公民将会注意到欧洲央行被赤裸裸地政治化服务于德国在希腊的目标，而欧元区也无可避免地将被认为是对小国十分“危险”的联盟。	Citizens of smaller eurozone member states will have noted the brutal way the ECB was politicized to achieve Germany’s goals in Greece, and the conclusion that the eurozone is a dangerous “union” for small countries will seem inescapable.
我们将给出一些建议，我们希望这些建议能够协调技术进步与人类最伟大的成就之一 — — 民主之间的破坏性对立。	We will produce recommendations that will, we hope, reconcile the disruptive tensions created between technological advances and one of humanity’s greatest achievements: democracy.

在现有情况下，全球政策制定者们需要即刻推动长久以来承诺的结构性改革，同时用理智且相互尊重的全球对话来取代指责与敌对。	In this case, the key will be for policymakers to pursue the structural reforms that they have long promised, while replacing finger-pointing and antagonism with a sensible and respectful global dialogue.
考虑到法、德、意三国的失业率高达10%以上，他们的恐惧心理也很容易理解。 由于新的工作机会少之又少，一旦失业就会带来一场严重的灾难。	This is understandable, given an unemployment rate of around 10% in France, Germany, and Italy; with so few new jobs, becoming unemployed is a major disaster.
他们的政治永远是极化政治，将真实世界中的公民分割为纯粹的、道德的人民和不道德的其他人 — — 埃尔多安常常称他们是“叛徒 ” 。	Their politics is always polarizing, splitting the actual citizenry into a pure, moral people and the immoral others – whom Erdoğan has often simply called “traitors.”
圣地亚哥—希望将整个南美大陆统一为一个国家的南美独立英雄玻利瓦尔一定会对如今南美大陆能源部门各自为战的情景痛心疾首。	SANTIAGO – Simón Bolívar, the South American independence hero who hoped to weave the continent into a single nation, would shudder at the disintegration that prevails today in the continent’s energy sector.
家庭消费占美国经济的约70 % ， 因此危机前后趋势之间2.7个百分点的差距足以让危机后真实GDP增长率趋势下降1.9个百分点。	With household consumption accounting for about 70% of the US economy, that 2.7-percentage-point gap between pre-crisis and post-crisis trends has been enough to knock 1.9 percentage points off the post-crisis trend in real GDP growth.
卢拉强调巴西一如既往地不会干涉古巴内政，甚至在一名异见分子绝食身亡之际照常访问哈瓦那，并且（虽未明确地）表示绝食者是咎由自取。	Lula also turned a blind eye to Hugo Chávez’s increasingly heavy hand in Venezuela, never protesting or questioning his jailing of opponents, his crackdowns on the press, trade unions, and students, or his tampering with the electoral system.
科学家一致认为，若要在本世纪中叶实现碳中性（排放量减少到能够被森林、土壤和其他自然系统轻松吸收的程度 ） ， 全球二氧化碳排放量必须在2020年实现由增转减。	Scientists agree that global carbon dioxide emissions must reach a turning point in 2020 if we are to achieve carbon neutrality (with emissions low enough to be safely absorbed by forests, soils, and other natural systems) by mid-century.
裁军问题重又登上了全球议事日程 — — 现在处理这个问题正当其时。 不久就将爆发推动裁军议程的新一轮的国际行动浪潮。	A groundswell of new international initiatives will soon emerge to move this agenda forward.
而且，这些措施需要成为一个结合了包括减轻个人金融负担内容的负责任的国家干预和节约公共预算的有说服力的全面方案的一部分。	Instead, they need to be part of a convincing overall plan that combines responsible state intervention with relief of the financial burdens of individual citizens, as well as savings in public budgets.
贝淡宁提出中国的威权主义 — — 特别是它的“精英政治 ” — —是一种可行的治理模式，甚至可能比印度和西方的民主制度还要好。	Bell argues that Chinese authoritarianism – specifically, its “political meritocracy” – is a viable model of governance, possibly even superior to the democracy of India and the West.
奥巴马政府的研究报告建议采取三管齐下的方针：投资人工智能（以利用其收益 ） ； 为工人提供未来就业岗位所需要的教育和培训；以及在转型过程中为工人提供补助。	The Obama administration’s study recommended a three-pronged approach: investment in artificial intelligence (to take advantage of its benefits); education and training of workers for the jobs of the future; and aid for workers in transition.
但美元作为国际锚的作用正在减弱，因为其他新兴市场国家越来越不满足于美联储的近零利率政策 — — 这导致“热”资本从美国涌入。	But the dollar’s role as international anchor is beginning to falter, as emerging markets everywhere grow increasingly frustrated by the Fed’s near-zero interest-rate policy, which has caused a flood of “hot” capital inflows from the US.
然而最近， 穆斯林原教旨主义却因诸如“al-Badr”和“Razaker”等曾在1971年内战中支持过残害平民暴行的民兵组织而蒙羞。	Until recently, Muslim fundamentalists were discredited, because militias such as “al-Badr” and “Razakar” had supported atrocities against civilians during the civil war of 1971.
同一个月，多达两百万支持独立的加泰罗尼亚人在巴塞罗那举行了游行，也许是欧洲有史以来规模最大的游行示威。	The same month, up to two million pro-independence Catalans marched through Barcelona, in what may have been the largest demonstration ever seen in Europe.

但是，这仅仅是证明剥削通常易受攻击的女性（在荷兰也有少量男妓，但是，他们没有像妓女那样被皮条客兜售）的正当性的方法。	But this is merely a way of justifying the exploitation of mostly vulnerable women (there is also a much smaller number of male prostitutes in the Netherlands, but they are not pimped out like female prostitutes).
美国指责中国造成了它的贸易赤字，对它的工人造成了压力，以中国所积累的巨大的外汇储备为证指责中国过度操纵货币。	America blames China for its trade deficits and the pressures they inflict on workers, citing a massive accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves as evidence of an unconscionable currency manipulation.
年轻的查谟和克什米尔邦行政长官阿卜杜拉（Omar Abdullah）定期上Twitter与粉丝互动，而长他好几岁的拉贾斯坦邦和喀拉拉邦行政长官格洛特（Ashok Gehlot）和钱迪（Oommen Chandy）也开了Facebook账户。	Similarly, Omar Abdullah, the youthful Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, regularly interacts on Twitter, and his much older Rajasthan and Kerala counterparts, Ashok Gehlot and Oommen Chandy, respectively, have opened Facebook accounts as well.

报告作者之一的帕斯卡尔·雷米（Pascal Lemy）曾被选为世界贸易组织总干事，当时，对于他要担任的岗位，甚至连可用于衡量他的资质的岗位描述都没有。	When Pascal Lamy, one of the authors of the report, was chosen to become head of the World Trade Organization, there was not even a description of the job against which his qualifications could be measured.
在一阵大肆喧闹中，当欧盟延伸“除了武器外的所有产品”项目（EBA ） ， 也就是向世界最贫困国家单方面开放其市场之际，发达国家们看似某些时候确实在实现其诺言。	With great fanfare, developed countries seemed for a while to be making good on their promise, as Europe extended the “Everything but Arms” initiative (EBA), under which it was unilaterally to open its markets to the poorest countries of the world.
目前透露的知识产权建议草案显示美国固执地要求为动植物提供专利保护，这种做法超越了世贸组织与贸易相关知识产权协议的���关规定。	Leaked drafts of intellectual-property proposals show an obstinate US effort to require patent protections for plants and animals, thus going beyond the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.
但当具有系统重要性的公司持有了过量回购协议债务时，我们所有人都要付出代价，首先是作为纳税人（当政府出手援助这些公司时 ） ， 然后又经受了由此导致的经济破坏和低迷的打击。	But when systemically vital firms overdose on repo, we all pay, first as taxpayers when the government bails them out, and then as we suffer from the resulting economic disruption and downturn.
欧元的采用国20世纪90年代末就不得不面对糟糕的劳工市场制度，过于庞大的养老金体系、对劳动者收入的高额税收和效率低下的服务部门，这个问题到今天也还没有解决。	The countries that adopted the euro had poor labor-market institutions, bloated pension systems, high taxes on labor income, and inefficient service sectors in the late 1990’s, and they still do now.
但说教育是本国的增长战略却意味着放弃了离开学校的全部劳动力 — — 18岁以上的人多数均已离校，而25岁以上的几乎全部离校。	But to say that education is your growth strategy means that you are giving up on everyone who has already gone through the school system – most people over 18, and almost all over 25.

与已经采用了“资讯权”的印度和将“被遗忘权”写入法律的欧盟不同，对于中国的数据隐私问题还未进行过任何严肃讨论。	Unlike in India, whose Supreme Court affirmed the right to privacy as a fundamental right, and the European Union, which has codified a “right to be forgotten,” there has not been any serious discussion about data privacy in China.
因此，在年轻人失业率的计算中，同样数量的找不到工作者所除之除数要小得多，这是因为劳动力总数更小，因此失业率看起来会高得多。	In calculating youth unemployment, therefore, the same number of unemployed individuals is divided by a much smaller number, to reflect the smaller labor force, which makes the unemployment rate look a lot higher.
这样，周边地区注定难逃破坏性通货紧缩和衰退性调整的厄运，导致经济衰退、破产、拖欠和欧元退出的风险进一步加大。	Thus, the periphery is destined to a destructive deflationary and recessionary adjustment that will exacerbate the risks of recession, insolvency, eventual defaults and, possibly, exit from the euro.
此外，曾经人们希望北约部署在欧洲、被广泛认为没有什么军事用途的为数不多的非战略性核武器可以撤回美国。	Moreover, it was once hoped that NATO’s small number of non-strategic nuclear weapons sited in Europe could be withdrawn to the US, as they were widely considered militarily useless.
公共融资需求并不意味着只有公共部门提供服务，私人医院和诊所有时也可以更有效地提供服务，这一点非常重要。	Importantly, public finance need not mean only public delivery; private hospitals and clinics can sometimes deliver services more effectively.
果真如此的话，目前新兴经济体所面临的资本流方向逆转趋势的程度可能比普遍认为的更严重 — — 有可能严重到触发危机。	If so, the magnitude of the ongoing reversal in capital flows that emerging economies are experiencing may be larger than is generally believed – potentially large enough to trigger a crisis.
特朗普政府已对钢、铝和大量中国产品征收关税（还有更多产品有待征收关税 ） ， 并在考虑提高欧洲和世界其他地区进口汽车的关税。	The Trump administration has imposed import tariffs on steel, aluminum, and a wide range of Chinese goods (with many more to come), and it is considering additional levies on automobiles from Europe and the rest of the world.
到目前为止，中国对外FDI集中于发展中国家和一小撮资源丰富的发达国家（如澳大利亚和加拿大 ） ， 主要目标是促进贸易和收购自然资源。	So far, China’s FDI outflows have been concentrated in developing countries and a handful of resource-rich developed countries, including Australia and Canada, and have been aimed at facilitating trade and acquiring access to natural resources.
这一宣布是在“公平贸易双周”期间作出的。 这一双周活动促进公平贸易产品，包括来自发展中国家的农民的演讲，他们告诉英国人公平贸易如何援助了他们的社区。	The announcement came during “Fairtrade Fortnight,” a two-week promotion of Fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries, telling Britons how Fairtrade has assisted their communities.
他有两个信念是不可动摇的：中国共产党只有通过经济发展才能继续掌握权力；中国只有在强大的一党制度下才能实现现代化。	Two ideas were incontrovertible: the CCP could retain its grip on power only by delivering economic development, and China could modernize only under a strong one-party system.
而那些有大额盈余的国家（比如中国）在控制其“重商主义”政策方面将面临越来越多的压力 — — 包括面临受到报复的威胁。	Those with large surpluses (such as China) will be under increasing pressure – including the threat of retaliation – to rein in their “mercantilist” policies.

其他发达经济体也需要提振萎靡的投资，新兴经济体则需要为人口增长、消费增加和交通支出需求提高做好准备。	Other advanced economies also need to revive moribund investment, and emerging economies need to prepare for population growth, increased consumption, and higher demand for transportation spending.
在3月19日的全民公决后（绝大多数伊斯兰主义者在这次公决中支持最终获得了77%支持率的宪法修正方案 ） ， 世俗派在自身要求的驱使下走上了街头。	Following the March 19 referendum, in which most Islamists campaigned for a package of constitutional amendments and got 77% support, secularists took to the streets, mobilizing behind their own demands.
埃及队的世界杯之路首先要归功于该队的明星球员穆罕默德·萨拉赫，而这位在2017/2018年两度当选英超年度球员的选手并已成为数百万埃及人的偶像。	The run-up to the World Cup was dominated by well-deserved praise for the team’s star player, Mohamed Salah, who was English football’s 2017/2018 double player of the year and has become an idol for millions of Egyptians.

用真实值（经通胀调整）衡量，美国联邦最低工资 — — 每小时7.25美元比1968年最高的时候低了三分之一。	The US federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is one-third lower in real (inflation-adjusted) terms than it was at its peak in 1968.
第五，从对美国的经济收益看，实施CFT将刺激离岸企业和就业岗位回归，从而恢复美国的工业潜力和社会平衡。	Fifth, in terms of economic benefits to the US, implementing CFT would stimulate the return of off-shored enterprises and jobs, thus restoring the country’s industrial potential and social balance.
尽管悬念总是被放在会议末段的中共高层领导班子调整上，但习近平总书记在开幕当天的政治报告也是一个具备高度影响力的事件。	Notwithstanding the suspense over potential changes in Party leadership, which typically occur at the end of the meeting, President Xi Jinping’s political report, delivered on the opening day, was a high-impact event.
美国最高法院在其臭名昭著的公民联合会（Citizens United）判决中授予公司随心所欲地使用手里的金钱影响政治动向的权利。	The US Supreme Court, in its notorious Citizens United decision, has given corporations free rein to use their money to influence the direction of politics.
当然，这样的联系也能带来重要的机遇；但人们内心所隐藏的对于熟悉的偏爱会妨碍工人、企业甚至政府利用这样的机遇。	Of course, this interconnectedness also offers important opportunities; but an implicit bias toward the familiar is impeding the ability of workers, firms, and even governments to take full advantage of them.
自2000年以来，世界上与冲突相关的死亡人数估计约60%来源于中东和北非，而伊拉克、利比亚、叙利亚和也门暴力事件每年继续导致数百万人流离失所。	Since 2000, an estimated 60% of the world’s conflict-related deaths have been in the MENA region, while violence in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen continues to displace millions of people annually.
正是这一格林斯潘在1996年对“非理性繁荣”发出了警告。 而且，当时作为美联储主席，他却对此听之任之。	This was the same Greenspan who in 1996 warned of “irrational exuberance” and, then, as Fed chairman, did nothing to check it.

一旦以色列和哈马斯之间的战争趋于缓和，阿拉伯国家将做些什么来支持巴勒斯坦温和派并与以色列和平相处的问题肯定会提上日程。	Once the fighting between Israel and Hamas subsides, the question of what the Arab states will do to strengthen Palestinian moderates and to make peace with Israel is sure to arise.
劳埃德TSB集团（Lloyds TSB）收购HBOS（苏格兰哈利法克斯银行）案以及美国的几起危机后整合案便是明证。	Witness the takeover by Lloyds TSB of the troubled HBOS (Halifax/Bank of Scotland) in the UK, or post-crisis consolidation in the US.
当那些在其它情况下本该愉快，健康且努力工作的劳动者因为缺乏技能、信心，社会网络以及经验而找不到合适的工作之时，这个问题就突显出来了。	When people who in other circumstances could be happy, healthy, and productive members of the workforce lack the skills, confidence, social networks, and experience needed to find work worth paying for, we obviously have a problem.
事实上，在支持经济复苏的政策纷纷失败的情况下，欧洲人越来越不再抱有幻想，这助长了民粹主义情绪和回归国家主权的要求。	Indeed, with every failed policy to aid economic recovery, Europeans have felt increasingly disenchanted, fueling populist sentiment and demands for a return to national sovereignty.
因此，大国和小国都能发出威胁，并希望这些威胁就足够使其欧洲经济与货币联盟中的同事同意他们想要的政策变化。	So either type of country could make the threat in the hope that it would be enough to cause their EMU colleagues to agree to their desired change in policy.
如果美国在联合国框架内密切合作，它将很容易在崛起的亚洲强国中找到合作伙伴，因为新崛起的亚洲国家都致力于运用自己的影响和资源迎接当今世界的挑战。	If the United States works more closely within the UN framework, it will find willing partners in the rising Asian powers, which are intent on using their influence and resources to solve today’s challenges.
只要涉险过关的多数党派掌权后奉行温和主义的政策，其合法性就可能受到变幻无常、而非四分五裂的选民们的欣然认可。	As long as winners with razor-thin majorities, once in office, steer a middle course, they are more likely to remain acceptable to an electorate that is more volatile than divided.
"首先，选举的性质是公开竞争，正式登记参选的政党达到了10个，其中也不乏反对党的参与，这都是以前的选举所无法比拟的。 就连""欧洲安全与合作组织""都承认，选民们有了""真正的选择权 。 """	"The official registration of ten parties, including opposition groups, surpassed any previous election, and the OSCE admitted that voters had ""a real choice."""
如果非洲经济想要吸纳今后几年即将进入劳动力市场的1.22亿年轻人，我们就必须搞清具体数字 — — 而且从现在开始。	If Africa’s economies are to absorb the 122 million young people expected to enter the labor force in the next few years, we must get the accounting right – starting now.

他们还应该恢复奥巴马总统订立的受托规则，要求专业财务顾问在向客户提供退休计划投资建议时把后者的利益摆在第一位。	They should also reinstate President Barack Obama’s fiduciary rule, which would have required professional financial advisers to put their clients’ interests first when advising them on assets invested in retirement plans.
房地产市场和股票市场的繁荣完全可以追溯到这样一个观点的发展过程：人应该一直不断地尽可能多地占有这些 资产，就像应该每天喝绿茶或者吃黑巧克力来抗氧化一样。	The booms in these markets can be traced substantially to the growth of the idea that one should always continually hold as many of these assets as possible, just as that you should drink green tea or eat dark chocolate every day for antioxidants.
事实上，截至2012年，只有大约一半中国中小企业开始利用互联网进行采购、销售和营销等活动 — — 这意味着最激烈的变化还没有到来。	Indeed, as of 2012, only about one-quarter of China’s small and medium-size enterprises had started to use the Internet in areas like procurement, sales, and marketing – meaning that the most sweeping changes lie ahead.
非洲私营部门的重生—在过去的发展方略当中所缺失的关键元素—在驱动这一发展态势方面发挥了巨大作用。 它可以弥补投资的欠缺，并在此过程中产生回报。	The rebirth of Africa’s private sector – a critical missing ingredient in past development efforts – has played a significant role in driving this performance, and it can fill the investment gap while generating returns in the process.
接下来的研究表明：变异型克雅氏病传染因子的生物属性与牛海绵状脑病完全相同，证明这两者之间的确存在着因果关系。	Later investigations have shown that the transmitting agent in variant CJD shares identical biological properties with BSE’s agent, supporting a causal relationship.
他称哈塔米所构建的体制为宗教民主，所有高等国家机关，包括他本人，都从人民通过选举所表达的意愿中获得合法性。	Thus, he described the regime instituted by Khomeini as a religious democracy in which all high state offices, including his own, derive their legitimacy from the will of the people as expressed in elections.
同时金融部门的问题可能尤其棘手：如果政治家们过度强调行动的紧迫性以换取授权，结果往往非但没能遏制危机，反而加速其爆发。	At the same time, financial-sector problems may be particularly difficult to address: if politicians emphasize the need for action too strongly in order to get a mandate, they might precipitate the very turmoil that they seek to contain.
一次罕见的集体政治智慧的奋力协作，并也为了防止任何国际冲突的发生，使得一项治理南极洲的国际条约于1959年得以签署。	In a rare spurt of collective political intelligence, and in order to prevent any risk of international conflict, an international treaty was signed in 1959 to govern Antarctica.
但很多评论者将这夸张地称为“股东之春 ” ， 与阿拉伯世界独裁者的倒闭相提并论。 从多个角度看，这样的比喻都是不正确的，比如，阿拉伯之春是连同制度一并推翻的。	But many commentators’ hyperbolic depiction of a “shareholders’ spring,” with its resonance of ousted Arab dictators, is inappropriate for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that the Arab Spring actually toppled regimes.
如今，中国在科伦坡进行一项14亿美元的工程，填海造出一片相当于摩纳哥大小的土地建造综合体 — — 这个“港口城市”将成为中国海上“之路”的主要停靠站。	"China has now embarked on a $1.4-billion project to build a sprawling complex roughly the size of Monaco on reclaimed land in Colombo – a “port city"" that will become a major stop on China's nautical “road."""
也许正因如此，澳大利亚和加拿大等国家的联邦制度可以成为他们的最佳选择 — — 英国不情愿地向苏格兰所做的让步亦然。	And perhaps that is why federal arrangements like those in Australia and Canada – essentially what Westminster grudgingly offered Scotland – could be their best option.
尽管政策上存在分歧，但在思想上是一致的，思想上的一致造就了单一市场、欧元和扩大的欧盟 — — 并形成了政治联盟。	Despite their policy disagreements, they jointly embodied the ideological consensus – and formed the political coalition – that built the single market, the euro, and the enlarged EU.
法国希望用欧洲工程将德国套住，以此限制德国的实力，而德国做好了牺牲马克换取法国接受统一的德国的准备 — — 德国的分裂是欧洲一场的恶梦。	France wanted to tame German power by harnessing it to the European project, and Germany was prepared to sacrifice the Deutsche Mark for the sake of France’s acceptance of a united Germany, the nightmare of Europe’s recent past.
因为宗教而对穆斯林施以极端主义行为同样存在，如今，基督教、犹太教、印度教和佛教徒都有狂热教徒抹黑着他们的信仰的真正性质。	There are extremist acts perpetrated against Muslims because of their religion, and today there are fanatical Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists who disfigure the true nature of their faith.
最近的总统选战也不例外：共和党和民主党都将矛头对准了中国和跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） ， 说它们是美国工人遭遇困境的祸根。	The current presidential campaign is no exception: Republicans and Democrats alike have taken aim at both China and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, holding them up as the scourge of beleaguered American workers.

欧洲必须自问：尽管2006年经济良好并没有导致实际利率产生变化，那么利率又怎么会导致2007年的衰退呢？	Europe must ask itself: how can interest rates induce a slowdown in 2007 when real interest rates have hardly budged despite an economically healthy 2006?
欧盟的2020展望计划已经为2014到2016年拨付了150亿美元的投资 — — 尤其在这样一个财政紧张的时刻，依然为智能城市理念预留了大量的资源。	The European Union’s Horizon 2020 program has earmarked €15 billion in 2014-2016 – a significant commitment of resources to the idea of smart cities, especially at a time of severe fiscal constraints.
通过自动化，用僵化的“无信任”条款将这些可能排除在商业上不可行，因为这要求所有金融协议都有100%的现金抵押，从资本成本角度，这实在过于疯狂。	Automating away these possibilities with rigid “trustless” terms is commercially non-viable, not least because it would require all financial agreements to be cash collateralized at 100%, which is insane from a cost-of-capital perspective.
发自剑桥 — — 从2014年4月起，日本的消费税率将从5%提高到8 % ， 以解决长期以来的高公共债务问题。	CAMBRIDGE – In April 2014, Japan’s consumption-tax rate is set to rise from 5% to 8% in an effort to address the long-term problem of high public debt.

如果动物生存在压力下，就会永久性地增加它们体内压力荷尔蒙的浓度，降低性荷尔蒙的浓度以及损害免疫系统。	If animals are under stress, they can have permanently raised concentrations of stress hormones, reduced concentrations of sex hormones, and compromised immune systems.
2015年3月，一些科学家、环保主义者和意见领袖集体致信G-20，警告称加码巨型工程投资有可能给环境造成不可逆转的灾难性伤害。	In a March 2015 letter to the G-20, a group of scientists, environmentalists, and opinion leaders warned that ramping up investment in megaprojects risks irreversible and catastrophic damage to the environment.
这些住宅项目与好工作所在地区相去甚远，住户中也鲜有家庭和睦、生活安康者，因此缺乏能指引年轻人的成功榜样。	Not only were the housing projects kept a safe distance from areas that had good jobs, but, with few residents experiencing stable families and livelihoods, there were not enough local examples of success to guide young people.
但上述方案已被证明是不够的，特别是从发展中国家的角度来看，因为它依然未能解决那个核心问题：转移定价体系。	But the BEPS program has proved to be insufficient, particularly from developing countries’ perspective, because it failed to address the core problem: the transfer-pricing system.
此外，该地区的其他国家不会再没有联合国安理会批准的情况下使用武力，而俄罗斯和中国不会的存在意味着不会有安理会的批准。	Moreover, other countries in the region will not use offensive force without approval by the United Nations Security Council, which the Russians and Chinese continue to block.

美国政府不会审查影片，但也不应该放弃说聪明话以及谴责可怕的、显而易见的、造成如此悲剧后果的国际挑衅行为的权威。	While rejecting censorship, the US government should not renounce its authority to speak sensibly and condemn an appalling and apparently intentional provocation that produced such tragic consequences.
除非这些大企业平台能采用与印刷，广播和电视相同的报导标准，否则深度报道和事实核查依然会逐渐没落，而这对民主和经济都是不利的。	Unless Big Tech platforms are held to standards that parallel those applied to print, radio, and television, in-depth reporting and fact-checking will remain dying arts. This is bad for both democracy and the economy.
外交官们让找到程序性解决方案的任务陷入了不可调和的两难；毫无疑问，他们希望能够给出一个与当前战略形势匹配的会议日程。	Diplomats make careers of finding procedural solutions to insoluble dilemmas; surely, they hope, there is a conference table with a shape that matches a given strategic configuration.
这一更强大的结构应该允许欧元区国家之间进行有限的资源转移，可以是反周期政策，也可以是补充性投资支出，特别是经济和社会基础设施方面的投资。	These stronger structures should permit limited resource transfers among eurozone countries, either to carry out countercyclical policy or to supplement investment spending, particularly in economic and social infrastructure.
石油价格近期下跌与1985-1986年增长驱动的下跌如出一辙，当时，欧（沙）佩（特）克（阿）成（拉）员（伯）决定取消减产以重新赢得市场份额。	The recent decline in oil prices is on par with the supply-driven drop in 1985-1986, when OPEC members (read: Saudi Arabia) decided to reverse supply cuts to regain market share.
放眼这些具体项目之外，有两个核心问题决定着联合国的未来：鉴于21世纪全球治理方面的赤字，联合国议事机构能否介入并做出符合形势要求的重大决策？	Looking beyond these specific items, two core questions loom in the UN’s future: Given the twenty-first century’s global-governance deficit, can the UN’s deliberative bodies step in and make the big decisions appropriate for the situation?
曾经占据区域老大地位的日本自资产泡沫爆破之后就走向了“迷失 ” ， 而走出了1989年天安门事件后期经济停滞的中国则迈向了如今的强劲增长之路。	Japan’s economy, once the region’s leader, was “lost” after its asset bubble burst, whereas China overcame the economic stagnation that followed the Tiananmen Square crisis of 1989 to achieve its current path of strong growth.
特朗普会说，任何对美国人的风险都是不可接受的，不管有多少阿兰·库尔迪因此丧命，又有多少人生活因此受到干扰。	Trump may argue that any risk to an American is unacceptable, regardless of how many Aylan Kurdis die and how many lives are disrupted.
尽管特朗普并未排除两国方案 — — 联合国也支持这一方案 — — 但他或许已经钉下了棺材板上的最后一颗钉子。	Though Trump has not ruled out the two-state solution – the approach endorsed by the United Nations – he may have put the final nail in its coffin.
整个欧洲社会模式的多元化，以及就共同规则达成一致的困难性，将成为一体化的节奏和范围的天然“刹车 ” 。	The diversity of social models across Europe, and the difficulty of reaching agreement on common rules, would have acted as a natural brake on the pace and scope of integration.
但是如果新闻机构主动努力避开互联网过滤，而不是被动地依赖防火墙里面的那些人自己寻找突破被封锁的网站的方法，那么新闻的受众可能将会比现在多的多。	But news organizations could reach many more people if they worked to circumvent Internet filtering instead of passively relying on those inside the firewall to figure out how to reach beyond blocked sites on their own.
接着，随着全球经济危机导致发达国家纷纷采取严厉财政紧缩，ODA再次回落，2010—2011年间只占GDP的0.31 % 。	Then, as developed-country governments imposed strict fiscal austerity in the wake of the global economic crisis, ODA fell again, to 0.31% of GDP in 2010-2011.
为了保持生产力 — — 以及收入 — — 不断上升，中国必须继续实施保持劳动力市场灵活性和人力资本发展的结构性改革，同时推进国有企业私有化并放松对金融部门的管制。	To keep productivity – and incomes – rising, they must continue to implement structural reforms that support labor-market flexibility and the development of human capital, while privatizing SOEs and liberalizing the financial sector.
这种行为令人憎恶，因为它对资源分配本身没有任何好处，供给不会在短时间内得到大幅度提高，它还伴随着巨大的分配成本，因为掌握资源的人利用手中的资源对缺乏资源者进行掠夺。	Such behavior is so odious because it brings little allocative benefit – no significant increase in supply in the short run – and carries a huge distributive cost, as those with resources take advantage of those without.
人们对萨尔科奇有关货币干预并且在货币政策决定上加上新的政治因素的民粹主义观点抱有兴趣，其份量要比人们通常认识到的要大。	There is more interest in Sarkozy’s populist ideas about currency intervention and adding a new political dimension to monetary policy decisions than is commonly realized.
来自不同政党的党派领袖在俄国的电视银屏上一闪而过，却始终没有形成如何带领国家前进的真正的全国性讨论。	Various political leaders of different political parties flash across Russia’s television screens, but there is no real national discussion about how to lead the country forward.
我这么说，代表的是那些坚定地相信欧洲对于现时代的核心要求 — — 可持续发展的承诺和开创性的治国之道的人。	I say this as someone who believes firmly in Europe’s commitment and pioneering statecraft when it comes to sustainable development, the core requirement of our time.
amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 弗里德曼和其他人在1998年所没有预料到的事情是，欧元诞生以后第一次严重的衰退与所有金融危机之母发生在同一时间。	What neither Friedman nor anyone else anticipated in 1998 was that the first serious downturn following the advent of the euro would coincide with the mother of all financial crises.
基因组“基编辑”等新技术甚至带来了一个广泛的“胚胎农场”的幽灵，让很多人呼吁重新评估如何监管胚胎研究。	New technologies such as genome “base editing” have even raised the specter of widespread “embryo farming,” prompting calls for a reevaluation of how embryo research is regulated.
尽管摩尔关于计算能力每两年增加一倍的定律意味着网络时间过得飞快，但人类习惯、法律法规和国家常规做法却变化更慢。	Although Moore’s law about the doubling of computing power every two years means that cyber time moves quickly, human habits, norms, and state practices change more slowly.
这不是滥用某个工具（当利益集团游说要求加入外部竞争保护条款时，这种情况经常发生 ） ； 相反，这属于完全按照预想方式使用工具。	This would not be a case of misusing a tool (a frequent occurrence in trade policy when interest groups lobby for protection against foreign competition); rather, it would be a case of using the tool in precisely the intended way.
除去技术和投资以外，格雷厄姆还在不知不觉间为奥巴马政府提出了外交政策建议，这个建议肯定非常符合克林姆林的胃口：即实现乌克兰的“芬兰化 ” 。	In addition to the technology and investments, Graham quietly slips in a foreign policy suggestion for the Obama administration that is sure to please the Kremlin: “Finlandizing” Ukraine.
只要把到达地表的太阳光线总量的1%至2%反射回去，所减少的热量就等于全球工业化之前地球温室气体所产生的总热量的两倍。	Reflecting just 1-2% of the total sunlight that strikes the earth could offset as much warming as that caused by doubling preindustrial levels of greenhouse gases.
这样的做法并没有形成公平，反而让大部分城市的市政水管理变得更加不平等，因为国家无法提供高效、可持续、全面的必须服务。	Far from leveling the playing field, this has made urban water management in most cities less equitable, because the state is unable to provide the necessary services in an efficient, sustainable, or comprehensive way.
发自图卢兹 — — 在过去半个世纪，全球顶尖学府都通过阿罗-德布鲁（Arrow-Debreu）一般竞争性均衡模型的视角来教授微观经济学。	TOULOUSE – For the last half-century, the world’s leading universities have taught microeconomics through the lens of the Arrow-Debreu model of general competitive equilibrium.
发生在巴勒斯坦难民营里的屠杀又促成了一个新任务，用罗纳德·里根总统的话来说，就是“为黎巴嫩重建一个强大的中央政府 ” 。	The massacres in Palestinian refugee camps prompted a new commitment to “restore a strong and central government” to Lebanon, to quote President Ronald Reagan.
问题在于，一些主要经济体的非常规货币政策创造了一个低收益率环境，使得投资者在某种程度上极其渴望获得高收益的选择。	The problem is that unconventional monetary policies in some major economies have created a low-yield environment, leaving investors somewhat desperate for high-yield options.
在发达的现代社会（如德国）里，知识分子可以毫无困难地使用明白无误的民族主义语言让具有民族意识的大众相信其民族地位受到了威胁。	In an advanced modern society, such as Germany, intellectuals have no difficulty using openly nationalist language to convince a nationally conscious populace of threats to national prestige.
没有活力和包容，通向和平的道路就会迷惘。 近年来科索沃、东帝汶、阿富汗、伊拉克以及其他许多非洲国家都说明了这一点。	Without both dynamism and inclusion, the path to peace will be elusive, as recent experiences in Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan, Iraq, and many countries in Africa illustrate.
控制气候变化既是道德需求，也是现实必要 — — 这个重要任务不能只由政客、石油巨头及其媒体宣传机器参与。	The control of climate change is a moral imperative and a practical necessity – far too important to be left to politicians, Big Oil, and their media propagandists.
盈利可能在相当长（但非无穷）的时间内以快于收入的速度增长，如果公司削减成本或降低投资的话 — — 这一趋势随着时间的延长可以降低折旧。	Earnings can grow faster than revenues for a prolonged (though not indefinite) period, if companies cut costs or reduce investment – a trend that would, over time, lower depreciation charges.
未来粮食保障（Feed the Future ） 、 美国全球发展实验室（US Global Development Lab ） 、 非洲力量（Power Africa）等项目结合了“地方所有权、私人投资、创新、多边股东合作和互相问责 。 ”	Initiatives such as Feed the Future, the US Global Development Lab, and Power Africa combine “local ownership, private investment, innovation, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and mutual accountability.”
在10月14日的巴伐利亚州以及两周后的黑森州地区选举中，AfD有可能进入最后两个尚未有极右翼代表的地区议会。	In regional elections in Bavaria on October 14 and in Hesse two weeks later, the AfD is poised to enter the two last remaining regional parliaments without far-right representation.
要实现上述目标并防止欧佩克解体，唯一的办法可能是包括美国在内的生产商减少轻质原油生产并因此失去市场份额。	The only way to do that – and prevent an OPEC breakup – would be to reduce the production of light sweet crude, including by US producers, which would thus lose market share.
尽管长期机构投资者持有约80万亿​​美元的资产，且其中一半左右是长期债权，但这里面近75％都是流动性工具，仅有3％是基础设施。	And while long-term institutional investors hold around $80 trillion in assets, with about half of these representing long-term liabilities, nearly 75% are held in liquid instruments, whereas just 3% are in infrastructure.
纽约 — — 欧盟是在卡尔·波普尔所谓的“零碎社会工程 ” （ piecemeal social engineering）的思想下产生的。	NEW YORK – The European Union was brought into existence by what Karl Popper called piecemeal social engineering.
较长期的趋势也改善了。 自世纪之交以来（这段时间，死亡人口超过了出生人口，比率为7比4 ） ， 由于政府给生育第三胎发放大量补贴，生育率从1999年每位妇女生育1.16个孩子的低谷上升到了2010年的1.58个孩子，快速的人口衰退已停止。	But Russia remains essentially a “rentier state” – that is, a state whose primary source of revenue is rent – in this case, oil and gas – rather than taxation, which thus keeps demands for political representation at bay.
然而对增长的假设性影响却认为因金融部门流失的一些高技能人士将转移到其他经济部门，而不是跟随这些金融职位前往别处。	The supposed impact on growth, however, assumes that some of the skilled people shed by the financial sector will move elsewhere in the economy, rather than following the finance jobs wherever they go.
此外，在埃及的例子中，埃及军队对保护自身巨大经济利益的兴趣远远高于捍卫响应人民要求的民选政府的好处。	Moreover, in this case, the Egyptian army appears far more interested in protecting its enormous economic interests than it is in securing the benefits of a civilian government responsive to its citizens.
政府在这些方面的关注度远远不够，部分是因为其好处要在在任者任期结束后才会显现，也有部分是因为政府计划的效率不够高。	Too little government attention has been focused on such issues, partly because payoffs occur beyond electoral horizons, and partly because the effectiveness of government programs has been mixed.
而自2001年来，单位劳动成本一直以高于实际GDP和就业率增长的幅度上升，这相对于发展中国家等于损害了本国经济竞争力。	Since 2001, unit labor costs have been growing faster than real GDP and employment, undermining the economy’s competitiveness vis-à-vis developing countries.
很多年轻人越来越难以获得良好的教育，他们在劳务市场中所处的地位也日益低下，尤其是那些来自贫困或者单亲家庭、或者有少数民族背景、操少数民族语言或信仰少数民族宗教的年轻人，他们受到的影响尤其显著。	Access to good education, and even more so to the labor market, is increasingly restricted for many young people, especially those who come from poor or single-parent families or from minority ethnic backgrounds, languages, or religions.
事实上，过去三十五年来，令人瞩目的五亿中国人实现了这一愿望，中国城镇人口��重从1980年的不到20%增加到今天的一半。	Indeed, over the past three and a half decades, a staggering half-billion Chinese have already made the move, raising the urban share of the country’s population from less than 20% in 1980 to one-half today.
尽管用欧盟委员会主席巴罗佐的话说 ， “ 大门仍然开着 ” ， 但欧盟领导人显然拒绝了就加深一体化进行严肃讨论的建议，至少在目前是如此。	Although “no door was closed,” in the words of European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, EU leaders have clearly refused, at least for now, to hold a serious discussion about deeper integration.
而如果特朗普政府突然变得更加团结的话（这倒确实需要出现奇迹才行 ） ， 实现特朗普的目标的可能性还会更大。	And achieving Trump’s target would be even more likely if his administration suddenly became more coherent (which could indeed require a miracle).
甚至在东亚经济体中TFP表现最为出色的香港在1960年到1990年期间的平均年TFP增长率也只有2.4 % 。	Even Hong Kong – the East Asian economy with the best TFP performance – registered only 2.4% average annual TFP growth from 1960 to 1990.
马德里 — — 在多年来分裂和紧张局势愈演愈烈后，欧盟可能即将失去其最宝贵的资产：和平、繁荣、迁徙自由以及宽容，开放和团结的价值观。	MADRID – After years of intensifying fragmentation and tension, the European Union may be on the verge of losing its most precious assets: peace, prosperity, freedom of movement, and values such as tolerance, openness, and unity.
外汇储备的不断增加主要源自于全球经济不平衡以及全球积累总需求的不足，这导致许多国家必须储备数千亿资金来应对全球经济的波动。	The build-up of reserves contributes to global imbalances and insufficient global aggregate demand, as countries put aside hundreds of billions of dollars as a precaution against global volatility.
最大的风险不总是世界银行和其他发展机构所关注的法律风险；而最大的风险是一个失败的公司所面临的商业风险或者是政体内部瓦解所带来的风险。	The biggest are not always the legal ones on which the World Bank and development agencies have focused; rather, they are the business risks of a company that fails or a polity that implodes.
中国在货币升值方面迈出了细小的第一步，无论最终会产生什么样的经济影响，都让人对其卓越的谋略感到佩服。	Whatever the ultimate economic effects of China’s first modest step towards floating its currency, one has to admire its strategic brilliance.
无独有偶：根据联合国及几项独立研究显示，从战争向和平过渡的国家大多都有50%的可能性会重新陷入战乱。	But Lebanon is not alone in that respect: according to the UN and several independent studies, countries in transition from war to peace face roughly a 50% chance of sliding back into warfare.
令人遗憾的是，成果还没来得及在企业界得到应用，这项研究计划就被取消了，这几乎毫无疑问是因为大公司的利益受到了威胁。	Unfortunately, the research program was cancelled before its findings could be applied in the business world, almost certainly because it threatened large companies.
他看到他的法学同学（其中没有一人是纳粹）如何接受每一步 — — 种族主义法律、废除宪法等等 — — 只因为它们披着合法的外衣。	He saw how his fellow law students, none of whom were Nazis, came to accept each step – racial laws, abrogation of the constitution, and so on – precisely because they were couched in legal terms.
阿巴斯就可以声称，他已经建议哈马斯续订停火协议并结束对以色列城镇的导弹袭击，但是，哈马斯却坚持使巴勒斯坦平民遭受战争的荼毒。	Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns, but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation.
其次，LEBACS年名义利率已经提高到40 % — —为世界最高，并 有可能导致央行债务如滚雪球般膨胀。	Second, the annual nominal interest rate on the LEBACS was raised to 40% – the highest in the world, and a move that risks creating a snowball of central-bank debt.
母亲、儿童、老人和残疾人最容易受到营养不良的侵害，因此在终结粮食不安全和营养不良的工作中应当受到重点照顾。	Mothers, young children, the elderly, and the disabled are among the most vulnerable to the pitfalls of undernourishment, and should be given special attention in efforts to end food insecurity and undernourishment.
哈杜德适用于通奸、酗酒和叛教等罪名。 这是一次马基雅维利式的操作，不但将PAS拉出了反对派联盟，也让哈迪为丑闻缠身的纳吉布辩护。	It was a Machiavellian masterstroke that not only drew the PAS out of the opposition coalition, but also led Hadi to defend the scandal-plagued Najib.
但这一指控与事实是矛盾的：人民币目前估值公允，中国实际上一直在干预市场支持人民币汇率，而不是让它进一步贬值。	But that accusation would be contrary to the facts: the renminbi is now fairly valued, and China has actually been intervening to support the exchange rate, not weaken it further.
后危机时代美国总需求的停滞状况 — — 尤其是消费者需求方面 — — 很可能持续，导致中国出口商无法在这个最大的出口市场中获取所需的支持。	Post-crisis sluggishness in US aggregate demand – especially consumer demand – is likely to persist, denying Chinese exporters the support they need from their largest foreign market.
因此，最有可能出现的局面是政府得以延续或者出现可以预期的改变（人们预期右翼势力将在未来若干年内把持总统一职 ） 。	The two most likely scenarios, then, are government continuity or predictable change (the right has been expected to capture the presidency for years).
在中国、巴西、马来西亚和墨西哥，国外直接投资（FDI）占到了固定资产构成总额的8%到12%¾而且不增加任何债务负担。	In China, Brazil, Malaysia, and Mexico, foreign direct investment (FDI) accounts for 8% to 12% of gross fixed capital formation – without generating debt.
得益于GATT/WTO体系下开放性多边贸易体系的不断延伸，战后贸易增长速度是全球GDP增速的1.5倍。	Owing to the expansion of an open multilateral trading system under the GATT/WTO, trade since WWII has grown 1.5 times faster than global GDP.
虽然在过去两年半的时间里我一直在严厉批评奥巴马的叙利亚政策，但这项新的战略政策既成熟又连贯 — — 虽然在某些方面与他一直公开宣扬的价值观有冲突。	Though I have been harshly critical of Obama’s policy toward Syria for two and a half years, his new strategy reflects a mature and coherent foreign policy – albeit one that does not fully live up to his proclaimed values.
许多孟加拉知识分子看到了不详的征兆，逃离了孟加拉国，为了自保不得不牺牲与他们丰富的文化遗产的日常联系。	Many Bangladeshi intellectuals have seen the writing on the wall and fled the country, sacrificing daily contact with their rich cultural heritage for the sake of self-preservation.
事实上，对于样本中的23个发达经济体来说，世界经济的风险其实已经转为通缩，虽然全球金融危机爆发已经过去了八年。	Indeed, the risk for the world economy is actually tilted toward deflation for the 23 advanced economies in the sample, even eight years after the onset of the global financial crisis.
迄今为止，英国的退欧辩论几乎完全基于感性，滔滔不绝地谈论英国在历史上如何伟大、外国暴政多么恐怖，或者反过来，关于打破现状所引发的担忧情绪。	So far, the Brexit debate in Britain has been almost entirely emotional, focusing on the historical greatness of Britain, the horrors of foreign tyrannies, or, conversely, fears of what might happen if the status quo were to be upset.
共产党将社会民主党视为比纳粹更大的危险；左派知识分子的注意力全部集中在了主流政党的伪善和腐败上，而其实这些政党才是他们所应该支持的。	Communists saw social democrats as a greater danger than Nazis; and leftwing intellectuals were distracted by the hypocrisy and corruption of mainstream parties they really should have supported.
首先，候选人应该有证明自己能力不仅限于界定一个任务，还要承担更具挑战性的部分 — — 组织动员一个广泛的利益相关者联盟来实现它。	First, candidates should have a proven ability not just to define a mission, but also to take on the more challenging task of mobilizing a broad coalition of stakeholders to achieve it.
加拿大总理特鲁多在2017年3月的得克萨斯州休斯顿能源会议上承认 ， “ 没有一个国家会在地里找到1,730亿桶石油而放任它们埋在地里 。 ”	As Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau conceded at a March 2017 energy conference in Houston, Texas, “no country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there.”
12月19日，国大党主席索尼娅·甘地（Sonia Gandhi）及其子、国大党副主席拉胡尔·甘地（Rahul Gandhi）被迫现身法庭出席腐败判决。	On December 19, Sonia Gandhi, President of the Congress party, and her son, Rahul Gandhi, the party’s vice president, were forced to appear in court on corruption charges.
但是，这种创新并不一定总是从国内开始，这就是为什么城市政府要学习其他城市和国家的经验教训并借鉴可能对他们有用的想法的原因。	But such innovation does not always begin at home, which is why city governments need to know about potentially applicable ideas and lessons from other cities and countries.
帕洛阿尔托—去年秋天，英国发布了一份在一流经济学家尼古拉斯·斯特恩爵士指导下出台的有关全球气候变化的重要政府报告即《斯特恩气候变化经济评价 》 。	PALO ALTO -- Last fall, the United Kingdom issued a major government report on global climate change directed by Sir Nicholas Stern, a top-flight economist.
今年马绍尔群岛创纪录的干旱、加勒比海地区毁天灭地的风暴，以及孟加拉国和美国灾难性的洪水都证明了这一点。	This year’s record-breaking drought in the Marshall Islands, apocalyptic storms in the Caribbean, and devastating floods in Bangladesh and the US demonstrate this.
跟1985年在西方压力下被迫进行日元大幅升值 （ “ 广场协议 ” ） 的日本不同，中国人选择更为渐进而谨慎地行事。	Unlike Japan, which was pressured by the West into a large yen revaluation in 1985 (the “Plaza Accord”), the Chinese have opted to move gradually and deliberately.
特朗普对华贸易方针所获得的美国主流支持比他的大部分其他政策都要多，因为大部分美国人 — — 包括许多在其他政策上反对特朗普的人 — — 坚信中国在进行不正当竞争。	Trump’s approach to trade with China enjoys more mainstream support in the US than most of his policies, because most Americans – including many who otherwise oppose Trump – are convinced that China is not playing fair.
欧洲央行将成为欧元区的权力中心（甚至超过现今 ） ， 因为它是这一货币联盟唯一可以采取实际行动的机构。	The European Central Bank will serve as the eurozone’s center of power even more than it does today, because it is the monetary union’s only institution that can actually act.
历史学家恩斯特·康托罗维奇（Ernst Kantorowicz）70年前提出的一个经验之道是，那些推动某一理念的人有义务忠实于“自己的良心和心中的神明 ” 。	One rule of thumb, offered 70 years ago by the historian Ernst Kantorowicz, is that those who advance an idea have an obligation to “their conscience and their God” to be sincere about it.
最后，人们可以理解一个以前的超级大国想要抓住其恢复强悍外交政策的机会的欲望，但是俄罗斯在能源问题上的粗暴政策正在破坏其他国家对俄罗斯的信任以及削弱它的软实力。	Finally, while one can understand a former superpower’s temptation to seize its opportunity to return to a muscular foreign policy, Russia’s bullying in the energy area is destroying trust and undercutting Russia’s soft power in other countries.
再加上向婴儿和孕妇提供的相关肉食补贴以及作为廉价食用谷物补充品的补贴豆类，该法买年将给印度增加60亿美元的财政赤字。	Together with related provisions that would provide meals to infants and expectant mothers, and subsidized pulses to supplement cheaply available food grains, the law will add $6 billion to India’s annual fiscal deficit.
从加入跨太平洋合作伙伴（TPP）谈判，到引入特别管辖区（我自己的办公室将监督它们的实施 ） ， 我的政府致力于竭尽全力催化经济复苏。	From joining the negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to introducing specially deregulated zones (my own office will oversee their implementation), my government is committed to catalyzing economic recovery by all means available.
同样，bKash现在主宰着孟加拉国的支付系统，以至于“bKashing”就像英语中的“Xeroxing ” 、 “Hoovering”和“Googling”一样，已经成为孟加拉语中的常用词汇。	Similarly, bKash now dominates the payments system in Bangladesh to such a degree that “bKashing” has become common Bengali parlance, just as “Xeroxing,” “Hoovering,” and “Googling” are in English.
过去，投资者使用过伦理标准 — — 比如拒买烟草股和煽动种族隔离的南非股 — — 并成功地给相关股票造成了压力。	Investors have used ethical grounds in the past – excluding, say, tobacco companies or corporations abetting apartheid in South Africa – and have been successful in generating pressure on the underlying stocks.
然后这位科学家会惊讶地（或者不会）发现俄罗斯大众竟然在一场名为“俄罗斯面孔”的投票活动中把斯大林选为第三号��欢迎人物。	Then this scientist will be surprised (or not) to discover that the Russian majority views Joseph Stalin as the third most popular person in a contest to be known as the “Face of Russia.”
如果说俄罗斯实力源泉在告竭，那么巴西可谓令人印象深刻，其国土几为印度的三倍，识字率高达90 % ， 人均收入也是印度的三倍（和中国的近两倍 ） 。	If Russia’s power resources seem to be declining, Brazil’s appear to be more impressive, given it has a territory nearly three times the size of India’s, a 90% literacy rate, and triple the per capita income of India (and nearly twice that of China).
但一家拥有深厚政治关系的私营企业处于疫苗丑闻核心的事实令人痛苦地证明，习近平这场自上而下的反腐运动并未像宣称的那样有效。	The fact that a private company with deep political connections is at the center of the vaccine scandal is painful evidence that Xi’s top-down anti-corruption drive has not been as effective as claimed.
因此，从某种程度上说，塔德里的巴基斯坦之行及其强烈的政治激进主义达到了目的：他增强了人民的对他们正在建设的制度的信念。	So, in a way, Qadri’s arrival in Pakistan and his intense political activism have served a purpose: he has reinforced the people’s faith in a system that they are continuing to build.
特朗普政府并不准备直接拿出如此巨大的投资，而是希望通过向私人部门提供些许税收激励，来让它们领衔各大项目。	And, instead of direct government investment of that amount, the administration wants to provide modest tax incentives for the private sector to spearhead various projects.
此外，政府需要对无家可归人口进行更准确的评估，毕竟带着孩子逃离家庭虐待的母亲与患有创伤后应激障碍的退伍老兵有着不同的需求。	Moreover, governments will need a more accurate assessment of the homeless population. A mother fleeing domestic abuse with her children has different needs than a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder.
只有英国领导人这样的蠢货（让他想起了“三傻 ” （ Three Stooges ） ） 才会相信这样的观点。	Only fools like the United Kingdom’s leaders (who reminded him of the Three Stooges) could believe otherwise.
也有少数例外：在经历了二十多年的停滞后，日本经济在首相安倍晋三政府的带领下扭转了局面；但是，通缩从20世纪90年代就开始困扰日本，走出通缩还有很长的路要走。	There are a few exceptions: After more than two decades, Japan’s economy appears to be turning a corner under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government; but, with a legacy of deflation stretching back to the 1990’s, it will be a long road back.
尽管最优所得税理论直接解释了效率激励和分配结果之间的权衡关系，但距离实现适当的平衡还有很长的路要走。	Although the theory of optimal income taxation directly addresses the tradeoffs between efficiency incentives and distributional consequences, the appropriate equilibrium remains a long way off.
这两个国家也有理由需要证明自己能为地区和全球稳定做出贡献 — — 特别是伊朗，关于其核计划的国际谈判正处于关键阶段。	Both countries also have reasons to demonstrate that they can contribute to regional and global stability – Iran, especially, as international negotiations over its nuclear program are at a critical stage.
在愤懑地回顾了国内的所发生的事件后，他说 ， “ 你在拉丁美洲真是幸运，尽管有时候好像并不是这样 。 ”	After a somber review of events in his country, he concluded: “You are very lucky to be in Latin America, even though it may not seem that way sometimes.”
尤其重要的是，苏布拉曼尼恩制定出了用以一个衡量经济强权的指数，而这一指数应当被那些正在思考世界经济领导权变迁的人们视为议论的焦点。	In particular, Subramanian develops an index of economic dominance that should become a focus of conversation anywhere that people want to think about changes in world economic leadership.
欧洲几个国家的左翼和右翼同样泾渭分明，尽管还没有发展到像拉美国家那样相互格格不入的地步。 在这样的大背景下，西班牙和意大利¾尽管不是波兰和捷克¾某种程度上正在向左翼靠拢。	Several Europe countries, too, have revealed a less dramatic left-right split, with Spain and Italy – though not Poland and the Czech Republic – moving somewhat to the left.
而此前为中国对马来西亚投资铺平道路的马哈蒂尔则通过取消价值近230亿美元的中国项目来结束自己的北京之行。	Mahathir, who previously cleared the way for Chinese investment in Malaysia, ended his trip to Beijing by canceling Chinese projects worth almost $23 billion.
此外，随着恐怖分子在组织内部地位的提升，或者从一个恐怖群体转到另一个恐怖群体，其中所涉及的风险、酬劳和必须遵守的制度也千差万别。	Moreover, there are vast differences in terms of risks, rewards, and imperatives as one moves up the organizational chain, or jumps from cell to cell.
"因此，生活在不强制信奉宗教国度里的埃及人和约旦人，比不得不小心提防有国家撑腰的""操守警察""的沙特人或伊朗人，总的来讲表现出更多的虔诚，也没有什么值得大惊小怪的。"	"Little wonder, then, that Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety, are more religious than Iranians or Saudis, who must cope with local ""virtue"" police backed by the state."
当然，应当将援助提供给专门的需求，例如，控制霍乱、粮食生产、安全饮用水以及卫生。 可以衡量并监督是否满足这些需求以抵制腐败。	Of course, aid should be directed to specific needs – for example, malaria control, food production, safe drinking water, and sanitation – whose fulfillment can be measured and monitored to resist corruption.
如今，内塔尼亚胡升级了其右翼语调 — — 并因此获得又一个执政期 — — 国际社会孤立以色列的运动也将更加热烈。	Now that Netanyahu has intensified his right-wing rhetoric – and been rewarded with another term in power – the international movement to isolate Israel will only gain momentum.
以贝卢斯科尼为对比的某些权威人士强调这两位夸夸其谈的亿万富翁有一个不同：他们认为贝卢斯科尼至少有某种魅力，以及敏锐得多的商业头脑。	Some pundits who have invoked the Berlusconi comparison have highlighted one distinction between the bombastic billionaires: Berlusconi, they say, at least has some charm and much more business acumen.
自1990年代中期以来，公共养老金，医疗保健和其他福利的正式合并强制缴费率已经很高 — — 相当于工资数额的50％以上，也高于经合组织国家的费率中位数。	Since the mid-1990s, the combined mandatory contribution rate for public pensions, medical care, and other benefits has officially been very high – about 50% over the wage bill, which is higher than the median contribution rate in OECD countries.
而国会成员不仅可以合法地利用机密信息进行交易，他们也确实这样做了，连这些行为对自身名誉造成损害的在所不惜。	Not only can members of Congress legally trade on confidential information; they do, despite the potential cost to their reputations.
内罗毕 — — 这是肯尼亚雨季的结束，但今年的暴风雨几乎已经达到了圣经级别，不仅冲走了人们阳光明媚的个性，还冲走了桥梁、汽车、牲畜和作物。	NAIROBI – It’s the end of the rainy season in Kenya, and this year’s storms have been almost biblical, washing away not only people’s sunny disposition, but also their bridges, buses, livestock, and crops.
事实上，即便中国在香港的政策变得日益强硬 — — 因此在当地不受欢迎 — — 梁依然证明自己绝对忠诚于中国执政者。	Indeed, even as China’s agenda in Hong Kong has become increasingly tough – and thus unpopular locally – Leung has proved himself to be absolutely loyal to China’s rulers.
而导致美国60年来独霸行长职位的世界银行闭门造车式的任命政策也不能为欧洲继续把持国际基金组织的领导地位提供理由。	Nor does the closed-door succession process at the Bank, where the US continued its sixty year lock on the Presidency, justify continuing European monopolization of the Fund job.
比如，更强大的破产法能让银行和监管部门执行信用纪律，将薄弱或破产的借款人踢出金融系统以提高其效率与竞争力及降低系统风险。	Stronger bankruptcy laws, for example, would enable Chinese banks and state authorities to enforce credit discipline, pushing weak or failed borrowers out of the system.
自从2009年3月再次担任总理职务以来 — — 他首次任职是从1996年6月到1999年7月 — — 内塔尼亚胡已经成功见证了前所未有的经济增长和一系列外交盛事。	Since returning as prime minister in March 2009 – he first held the job from June 1996 until July 1999 – Netanyahu has overseen unprecedented economic growth and a series of diplomatic feats.
法国驻美国大使杰拉尔·阿罗德（Gérard Araud）指出，俄罗斯对选举的干预和操纵如果不加以遏制，有可能给西方民主国家造成“生存威胁 ” 。	According to Gérard Araud, France’s ambassador to the United States, Russian electoral interference and manipulation, if left unchecked, could pose an “existential threat” to Western democracies.
前者意味着权力从一个占统治地位的国家转移到另一个，这在历史上早已屡见不鲜了，而后者则是个更为新颖的过程。	The transition of power from one dominant state to another is a familiar historical pattern, but power diffusion is a more novel process.
工厂工作仍然不令人愉快，但蓝领岗位已能够让人过上中产阶级的生活，拥有中产阶级的消费能力和生活方式机会。	While factory jobs never became pleasant, blue-collar occupations now enabled a middle-class standard of living, with all its consumption possibilities and lifestyle opportunities.
负利率只能起到转移注意力的作用，让人们不再更深刻地分析是什么出了问题 — — 以及是什么仍然在出问题。	Negative interest rates are simply a distraction from a deeper analysis of what went wrong – and what continues to go wrong.
此外，牛奶厂未来能够产生丰厚的高流动性美元流（这意味着较高的回报率 ） ， 而国际储备可能收益寥寥（如果存在海外的话，回报率甚至可能为负 ） 。	Moreover, the plant will generate a hefty flow of liquid dollars in the future (implying a high rate of return), while the international reserves will likely yield very little (or could even have a negative rate of return when deposited abroad).
据统计，仅印度一个国家就几乎占全球板球收入的90 % , 这使该项运动的传统参与者－英格兰和澳大利亚，大为逊色。	It is estimated that India alone accounts for nearly 90% of cricket’s worldwide revenues, putting the game’s traditional guardians, England and Australia, in the shade.
资本是中国GDP增长率的最大贡献因素，这毋庸置疑。 但中国经济的TFP表现也令人印象深刻 — — 而这一现象却是无法用粗放型增长模式解释的。	While capital has been the largest contributor to China’s GDP, the economy’s TFP performance has been impressive – something that cannot be explained by an extensive growth pattern.
从特朗普身上，我们不仅会看到持续密集的推特攻势，还会看到他利用电视、包括脱口秀和其他渠道直接向民众发表谈话。	From Trump, we should expect not just a continued Twitter barrage, but also the use of TV, including talk shows, and other channels to speak directly to the people.
这就是我们今天的目标；我们必须充满激情地致力于这一目标，就像民主的敌人那样充满激情地致力于它们的���标。	This is our purpose today; we must commit ourselves to it as passionately as democracy’s enemies pursue theirs.
一部限制交通运输罢工的法律在元旦生效，而且尽管间接地，萨尔科奇也打算打破每周35小时工作时间的规定。	A law restricting transport strikes took effect on January 1, and Sarkozy intends to break the 35-hour workweek, albeit indirectly.
但自相矛盾的地方在于， 这其中可能包含了一种叫作“健忘”的因素，因为它往往掩藏了一个事实：有解放就必然有军事上的胜利。	But paradoxically, it may also contain an element of forgetfulness, because it tends to conceal the fact that liberation required a military defeat.
更高的市场准入度，市场改革和协调监管的努力—包括那些在欧盟的《金融服务行动纲领》中的条款—都有助于推动这一潮流。	Greater market access, market reform, and efforts at regulatory harmonization - including those under the EU's Financial Services Action Plan - should help advance this trend.
特朗普的“军师 ” 、 极右翼媒体“布莱巴特新闻 ” （ Breitbart News）CEO史蒂芬·班农（Stephen Bannon）早就在着手布局这一意识形态工程，我们现在知道，他和特朗普的言论必须认真地按照字面意思对待。	Stephen Bannon, Trump’s White House Svengali and former CEO of the extreme right Breitbart News, has long pursued this ideological project, and we now know that what he or Trump says must be taken both seriously and literally.
美国癌症协会（American Cancer Society ） 、 美国心脏协会（American Heart Association）以及国家卫生研究局（National Institutes of Health）等基于疾病的研究机构就是显著的例子。	The American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association, as well as the disease-based research institutes of the National Institutes of Health, are notable examples.
在许多国家，特殊利益对决策官员有着过度的影响力，监管者也常常通过所作所为应该受其监督的人的眼睛看世界。	Special interests hold undue sway over official decision-makers in many countries, and regulators are always prone to see the world through the eyes of the people whose activities they are supposed to oversee.
提案同时也要求货币市场基金拒绝某些赎回行动中的一部分交易，从而令投资者们承担更多的风险 — — 如果他们的投资受损的话基金或许不会有完全的交易流动性。	The proposal would also have required that money-market funds hold back a fraction of some redemptions, thereby making investors take some risk that funds might not have complete transactional liquidity if their investments weakened.
2008年10月的《世界经济展望》分析了经历系统金融压力之后的复苏，从中得出的教训被用在了后续预测中。	Lessons from the October 2008 WEO, which analyzed recoveries after systemic financial stress, were incorporated into subsequent forecasts.
我可以轻易地构想出一套双边协议 — — 可以扩充为多边协议 — — 为所有纳税人建立独一无二的全球纳税ID。	I can easily imagine bilateral agreements – and then a multilateral arrangement – that establishes a unique global tax ID for all taxpayers.
近年来，美国消费者的消费水平都相当于或高于其收入水平，美国整个国家的开支也远远大于其财力。 2005 年，美国以狂热的步伐向世界其它国家借款，每天超过 20 亿美元。	As in recent years, he consumed at or above his income level, and the United States as a whole spent well beyond its means, borrowing from the rest of the world at a feverish pace in 2005 – more than $2 billion a day.
尽管以民主的名义与恐怖主义作战，实际上这一斗争由于官方的立法以及民众的忧虑而已经导致对民主明显的削弱。	While terrorism is fought in the name of democracy, the fight has in fact led to a distinct weakening of democracy, owing to official legislation and popular angst.
并且事实上，在新生欧洲经济共同体内部开放国界的1957年罗马条约促使欧洲内部贸易迅速扩大，从而促成了经济的共同复苏。	And, indeed, the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which opened national borders within the new European Economic Community, enabled the rapid proliferation of intra-European trade, thereby contributing to a shared economic recovery.
而且，愤怒而失业的年青也门男子经常成为另一个沙特错误政策的目标 — — 沙特向他们宣传输出伊斯兰逊尼派瓦哈比教义。	Embittered and unemployed, young Yemeni men often become subject to another Saudi policy gone awry – its propagation for export of the Sunni Wahhabi form of Islam.
承诺解决毛主义武装人员的前途问题，以及和平协议声称的国家军队的“民主化 ” ， 尼泊尔现在都必须加以实现。	Commitments to resolve the future of the Maoist combatants, along with what the peace agreements call the “democratization” of the state army, must now be implemented.
尽管中国方面有言辞过激之嫌，但日本民族情绪的确有右移的倾向，只不过这种右移不大适合用军国主义来形容。	While Chinese rhetoric is overheated, there is certainly a rightward shift in mood in Japan, though it would be difficult to describe it as militaristic.
国际经济表现和社会进步测量委员会（International Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress，我是该委员会主席）的报告强调GDP不是衡量经济表现好坏的好指标。	The report by the International Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress (which I chaired) emphasized that GDP is not a good measure of how well an economy is performing.
推翻格鲁吉亚、乌克兰以及吉尔吉斯坦后苏联领导人的“颜色革命”另中共大惊失色。 中共害怕国内非政府组织也会成为大众起义的催化剂而予以打压。	The Party, alarmed by the “color revolutions” that toppled post-Soviet leaders in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, is cracking down on domestic non-government organizations for fear that they, too, might become catalysts for popular uprisings.
1995年，一支北约维和部队被派往冲突地区，但在1999年北约军事干预科索沃时，俄罗斯支持塞尔维亚反对科索沃脱离，而科索沃至今仍未获得联合国成员资格。	In 1995, a NATO peacekeeping force was sent to the troubled area, but when NATO intervened militarily in Kosovo in 1999, Russia backed Serbia’s objections to secession, and Kosovo has still not been admitted to the UN.
在OMT计划下，欧洲央行可以通过直接购买将西班牙提升至与英国等非欧元区国家相同的水平，从而代替从主权债券市场逃离的外国资本。	Under the OMT program, the ECB can replace foreign outflows from sovereign-bond markets through direct purchases, putting Spain on par with non-eurozone countries like the United Kingdom.
对英国最常见的两种大麻，hash和sinsemilla （ “ 臭鼬 ” ） 的比较发现，使用臭鼬大麻的精神病风险显著较高，而hash大麻则否。	A comparison of the two most common types of cannabis in the United Kingdom, hash and sinsemilla (“skunk”), found that using skunk implied a significantly greater risk of psychosis, while hash did not.
所谓四大“破坏力”本身都是转型性力量，它们无时无刻不在放大着各自的效果，为世界带来前所未有且不可预知的根本性变化 — — 这些变化会证明我们的直觉错误。	Each of these four “great disruptions” is transformational on its own, and all are amplifying the effects of the others, producing fundamental and unpredictable changes on a scale the world has never seen – and that will prove our intuitions wrong.
2009年4月2日，世界首脑们将再次前往伦敦为金融与经济危机寻找解决之道，而这次危机的可怕程度堪比1929年的那次。	On April 2, 2009, world leaders will head to London again to find a solution to a financial and economic crisis as dire as that of 1929.

但与此同时，工党似乎指望鬼才知道是什么的因素协助其力挽狂澜，并祈祷自己不要在民族党扬言要大获全胜的苏格兰元气大伤。	In the meantime, Labour seems to be hoping for who-knows-what to turn the tide, while keeping their collective fingers crossed that they will not be eviscerated in Scotland, where the Scottish National Party is threatening to sweep the board.
位于马来西亚的研究组织CARI的董事长彭润年（John Pang）所说，今天处于过渡期的缅甸是“中国出局不玩的一个游戏 ” 。	John Pang, the Chief Executive of CARI, a research organization based in Malaysia, says that today’s transitional Myanmar/Burma is “a game the Chinese gave away.”
水当然不应该成为昂贵的奢侈品，但政府不愿意按合理水平收水费制约了它们投资于水公用设施的能力，包括合理的废水收集和处理系统。	While water obviously shouldn’t become an expensive luxury good, governments’ reluctance to charge appropriately for it has undermined their ability to invest in water utilities, including proper wastewater collection and treatment.
但是，流动性供应 — — 如果不尽快辅之以重塑增长的政策的话 — — 仍然只能推迟而不能阻止货币联盟的解体，最终导致经济/贸易联盟的崩溃和单一市场的毁灭。	But, again, liquidity provision alone – without policies to restore growth soon – would merely delay, not prevent, the breakup of the monetary union, ultimately taking down the economic/trade union and leading to the destruction of the single market.
因此就需要第二轮政策和机构改革，来“打发”银行和其他金融机构的那些不安的债权人 — — 它们必须接受亏损的现实（也就是“割肉 ” ） 。	Thus, a second set of policies and institutional reforms requires that all unsecured creditors of banks and other financial institutions need to be “treated” – that is, they must accept losses (or “haircuts”) on their claims.
受治疗人数的增长非常可观 — — 2007年，51个国家超过5亿人接受了象皮病治疗，19个国家的6000万人接受了河盲病治疗。	The increase in treatment has been spectacular – more than 500 million people in 51 countries treated for elephantiasis in 2007, and 60 million in 19 countries have been treated for river blindness.
这将进一步削弱各大金融市场的信心 — — 它们早就对特朗普的贸易战满腹牢骚，总统每宣布一次关税，市场就展开一轮抛售。	This would further undermine confidence in financial markets, which are already unhappy with Trump’s trade war, responding to every tariff announcement with a selloff.
讽刺的是，在消除伤害的时候，特朗普的竞选口号 — — “美国优先 ” — —正好指向了美国领导人应该开始的地方。	Ironically enough, when the time comes to repair the damage, Trump’s campaign vow – “America First” – will point to where American leaders need to begin.
纽约 — — 人们对目前土耳其城市涌动的反政府示威浪潮的一种解读是这是一次反对政治化伊斯兰教的大规模抗议活动。	NEW YORK – One interpretation of the anti-government demonstrations now roiling Turkish cities is that they are a massive protest against political Islam.
直到埃德加·麦迪逊·韦尔奇（Edgar Maddison Welch）手持AR-15闯入这家披萨店连开数枪，媒体才终于注意到Reddit在假新闻现象中所扮演的角色 — — 而这种关注也只是一阵风。	When Edgar Maddison Welch, armed with an AR-15, arrived at the establishment and started firing off rounds, the media finally, but only temporarily, took notice of Reddit’s role in the fake-news phenomenon.
在实施制裁的2014到2017年中，民众实际可支配收入下降了17 % 、 投资骤降了12 % ， 虽然国内生产总值在此期间仅下降了0.5％的水平。	During the four sanction years from 2014 to 2017, real disposable incomes plunged by 17%, and investment slumped by 12%, though GDP fell by only 0.5% in this period.
但已在广岛和长崎经历了两次原子弹轰炸的日本在8月14日接受了波茨坦公告，这意味着在红军开进时，战争已经结束了。	But Japan, having already endured the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had accepted the Potsdam Declaration on August 14, meaning that the war was already over when the Red Army marched in.
此外，尽管欧元区外围可能需要更多整合，但核心部分 — — 如德国 — — 可以追求临时性财政扩张（降低税收、增加公共投资）以刺激内需和增长。	Moreover, while the eurozone periphery may need more consolidation, parts of the core – say, Germany – could pursue a temporary fiscal expansion (lower taxes and more public investment) to stimulate domestic demand and growth.
该课程研究从17世纪一直到现在的流行作品，邀请学生思索这些畅销作品为什么和以何种方式吸引了它们的观众。	A survey of popular writing from the seventeenth century to the present, the course invites students to consider how and why particular best-selling works have captivated their audiences.
美国总统特朗普最近告诉纽约北部居民，他们应该离开该地区，去别处找工作，这无非是全球北方国家过去一代政客们的老生常谈。	When US President Donald Trump recently told upstate New Yorkers that they should leave the region and seek jobs elsewhere, he was simply echoing the past generation of center-right politicians in the global North.
几十年来，欧洲有一种集体愧疚，觉得应该为此前对犹太人所做的事感到羞愧，如今，人们终于可以带着幸灾乐祸的心理说，犹太人也可能是杀人犯。	After decades of feeling obliged to drop the collective European head in shame for what was done to the Jews, people can finally say with an element of glee that Jews can be murderers, too.
当然，市场可以将这些交易移出法国和法国金融机构，而如果是监管者错了 — — 这一业务有利可图而且并不影响稳定 — — 那么法国机构将蒙受损失。	To be sure, markets might move those transactions from France and from French financial institutions, and, if the regulators erred – because the business was profitable and not destabilizing – French institutions would lose out.
随着非传统威胁的日益增加，欧洲日益忽视国家间战争等传统安全风险，认为它们不再与自己有关 — — 这一概念便体现在ESS中。	With the rise of non-traditional threats, Europeans are increasingly overlooking classical security risks like inter-state warfare, believing that they are no longer relevant – a notion that is reflected in the ESS.
这样做可能意味着在为选举前查禁候选人的行为作出补偿，并显示出一种目前什叶派政治精英所尚未显示出的政治成熟度。	Doing so might well mean a retreat from the pre-election banning of candidates, and would demonstrate a maturity among the Shia political elites that they have not yet shown.
最后，公益服务伦理观 ： “ 还有，我的美国同胞：不要问国家能为你做些什么 — — 问问你能为你的国家做些什么。	Finally, there was Kennedy’s ethic of service on behalf of the commonwealth: “And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.
但是，在目前，对中国来说最好的选择也许是人民币盯住美元并在上下5%的幅度内调整，在这一幅度内，人民银行可以进行轻微干预，目的是引导市场回归人民币与美元的长期挂钩平价。	For now, however, the best option may be for China to peg the renminbi to the dollar, with an adjustment band of 5%, within which the central bank would intervene only lightly, to guide the market back to parity over the long term.
草率设计的削减开支计划削弱了经济增长，使得政府的财政状况日益恶化，迫使其削减公共服务和基础设施项目，结果是国家能力受到了严重侵蚀。	Hastily designed spending cuts have undermined growth, and thus the government’s fiscal position, forcing it to kill off public services and infrastructure projects. The result has been a severe erosion of state capacity.
市场失灵以及需求得不到满足的诉求本不足以构成政府干预私人经济的充分条件，因为药方可能比疾病更加糟糕。	Market failures or claims of unmet need are not sufficient to prescribe government intervention in the private economy, because the cure may be worse than the disease.
在1948年，天文学家佛瑞德·霍伊尔（Fred Hoyle）说 ， “ 一旦有了从外部给地球拍摄的照片 — — 一旦地球的绝对孤立变得众所周知 — — 和历史上那些有影响力的观点一样强大的新观点就会产生 。 ”	In 1948, the astronomer Fred Hoyle said, “Once a photograph of the Earth, taken from outside, is available – once the sheer isolation of the earth becomes plain – a new idea as powerful as any in history will be let loose.”
为公司裁员设置层层阻力只能为员工提供一种虚幻的表面利益，因为这种做法牺牲的是公司的竞争力，并且削弱了他们创造就业机会的动力。	But making it difficult for firms to lay off workers provides only an illusory benefit for workers, for it compromises companies’ ability to compete, and weakens their incentive to create jobs.
此外新的国际准则也日渐通行，那么原本对政变，军事独裁和镇压睁一只眼闭一只眼的外部势力也加入了民主和人权的行列。	Moreover, new international norms had come to the fore: external powers that previously turned a blind eye to coups, military dictatorships, and repression now rallied around democracy and human rights.
银行系统如此分散脆弱的连带效应淋漓尽致地表现在欧洲其他对欧盟成员国经济未来至关重要的行业的拙劣表现中，如技术和能源行业。	The knock-on effects of such a fragmented and vulnerable banking system are apparent in Europe’s relatively poor showing in other sectors, such as technology and energy, that are vital for EU members’ economic future.
一座纪念碑纪念着26位殉教的罗马天主教徒，十六世纪末，日本掀起了一场清除基督信仰的运动，这26人被钉在十字架上处死。	A monument commemorates the martyrdom of 26 Roman Catholics, who were crucified at the end of the sixteenth century as part of the effort to stamp out the growth of Christianity in Japan.
如果政府在财政稳固方面没有强有力的政治承诺和可信的计划，那么还存在着这样一种明显风险：即某一时刻，主权债务的收益率将会显著上升，这将会给经济和政治两方面带来不利影响。	A line must be drawn between a time of crisis, when emergency measures are needed to avert economic collapse, and normal circumstances, in which the full force of market mechanisms applies.
希望的曙光也已经闪现。 在刚刚结束的法 — 德领导人会议之后，德国总理默克尔没有公开反对建立欧盟经济政府的理念，这可是破天荒头一遭。	One sign of hope is that, following the recent Franco-German summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time did not publicly oppose the idea of a European economic government.
他曾是共和党操盘手罗杰斯通的商业伙伴，而后者与特朗普的关系一直是非常亲密的（穆勒正在将关注的重心移到斯通身上 ） 。	He was also a former business partner of Republican operative Roger Stone, who remained close to Trump. (Mueller’s spotlight is now moving toward Stone.)
而究竟被委任到政府部门的是有能力的技术官僚，还是正如过去曾经发生过的那样，只是些政党鹰犬，将是一个有说服力的信号。	Whether competent technocrats, or as has happened in the past, party hacks are appointed to the ministries will be a telling sign.
但无论伊朗核计划命运如何，还有朝鲜核计划，半个世纪以来作为全球核武器秩序基石的核不扩散条约的削弱才是人类所面临的最大威胁。	But, regardless of what becomes of Iran’s nuclear program, or of North Korea’s for that matter, a weakening of the NPT – the bedrock of the global nuclear order for a half-century – represents the biggest threat of all.
从环境角度看，过去二十年中，因恐怖分子袭击我们的管道而流入我们的江河和海洋的石油及估算超过四百万桶。	In terms of the environment, the amount of oil spilled into our rivers and oceans by terrorist attacks on our pipelines is calculated to be more than four million barrels over the last two decades.
1979年，他辞去公职担任“革命指挥官”这一模糊职务，并解释说“革命事业必须要和国家权力分开 。 ”	In 1979, he resigned from his official posts to assume the vague role of “Commander of the Revolution,” explaining that “the revolution must be separated from the authority of the state.”

这需要超越封闭的、以提问-回答为顺序的典型的实验室过程，提早并以比从前任何时候更频繁地在社会中应用我们的思想。	This involves moving beyond the closed, question-and-answer process typical of the lab, and applying our ideas in society, earlier and more frequently than ever before.
但是这种对全球市场经济规则的无效反应隐藏了一个事实，即德国的问题从很大程度上来说是过去三十年以来福利过度和欧盟极度侵略性政策的结果。	But this useless reaction to the laws of the global market economy hides the fact that Germany’s problems are largely a result of an overblown welfare state and extremely aggressive union policies over the last thirty years.
但在数百年前所未有的暴力最终导致两次世界大战并进一步强化法德两国看似无解的敌意后，经济一体化必须得到欧洲民众和平繁荣愿景的支持。	But economic integration was underpinned by a vision of peace and prosperity for Europe’s peoples, after centuries of unprecedented violence had culminated in two world wars that reinforced the seemingly eternal enmity between France and Germany.
特朗普承诺再次减税被普遍视为共和党国会领导人 — — 最重要的是，该党最大的捐助者 — — 在2016年总统大选中支持他的主要原因，而且他们仍在这样做。	Trump’s promise to cut taxes again is widely viewed as a major reason why Republican congressional leaders – and, most important, the party’s big donors – supported him in 2016 and continued to do so.
2015年 ， 《 纽约时报》前南亚记者加丁纳·哈里斯（Gardiner Harris）解释说之所以离职，完全是因为居住在德里危害到孩子的健康。	In 2015, the New York Times’ former South Asia correspondent, Gardiner Harris, explained that he was leaving his post prematurely because merely living in Delhi was damaging his children’s health.
中国经济可能继续增长，但是速度会大大放缓，远远低于这些年来每年11 % - 12%的增长速度，而这主要是因为出口急剧下挫。	Largely as a result of a precipitous fall in exports, China is likely to continue to grow, but at a much slower pace than the 11-12% annual growth of recent years.
墨西哥人在美国的所有合法或非法移民移动和总量上占据一半以上，但是在美国人的辩论中却基本上一直没有试图反映墨西哥人利益以及渴求的观点。	Mexicans make up more than half of the flow and stock – legal or not – of all immigrants in the US, but a point of view attempting to reflect their interests and aspirations has been largely absent from the American discussion.
比尔·盖茨认为，要减小不平等性、抵消自动化的替代效应所造成的社会成本，就必须对Nexus征收所得税，或对卢克征收用机器人替换肯的重税。	Bill Gates thinks that, to ease the inequality and offset the social costs implied by automation’s displacement effects, either Nexus should pay income tax, or Luke should pay a hefty tax for replacing Ken with a robot.
首尔 — — 如果选举提前到明天，而不是2012年12月进行，谁将成为下一任国家总统已经成为韩国老生常谈的话题。	SEOUL – It is something of a cliché question in South Korea nowadays: Who would be the country’s next president if the election were held tomorrow, rather than in December 2012?
很有可能，中国官员已经通过秘密渠道检验了他们控制某些金正恩身边影子人物的能力，而金正恩似乎越来越偏执地认定随时可能发生政变。	And it is very possible that, behind closed doors, Chinese officials are already testing their ability to manipulate some of the shadowy figures surrounding Kim, who appears increasingly paranoid about the possibility of a coup.
除非沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和其他国家积极主动地切断使叛乱得以持续的人流和资金流，否则伊拉克就永不得稳定、民主和繁荣。	Until states such as Saudi Arabia, Syria, and others vigorously dry up the inflows of people and money that sustain the insurgency, Iraq will never become stable, democratic, and prosperous.
但他们也必须意识到政治反弹和挫折是无法避免的 — — 因此把愿景变成现实也许要花费比预想中更长的时间。	But they must also recognize that political backlashes and setbacks are inevitable – and thus that the road from vision to reality may be longer than expected.
如果政治家们能改变谈判进程并在今年12月达成一致，将更大数量投资在研究和提高技术方面，我们就可能拥有一个更好的机会把这项技术提高到所需的水平之上。	If politicians change course and agree this December to invest significantly more in research and development, we would have a much greater chance of getting this technology to the level where it needs to be.
苏格兰也许会试图保持其自身货币与英镑的平价，但这需要比苏格兰中央银行所能拥有的更大的储备量，至少在一开始是如此。	Scotland might try to keep its currency at par with sterling, but this would require larger reserves than a Scottish central bank could command, at least at the outset.
伦敦—7月17日，英国很有影响力的纳菲尔德生物伦理学会（Nuffield Council on Bioethics）含蓄地赞同了“可遗传基因组编辑 ” ， 宣布改变人类胚胎DNA的做法在一定的条件下“在道德上可接受 ” 。	LONDON – On July 17, the United Kingdom’s influential Nuffield Council on Bioethics implicitly endorsed “heritable genome editing,” declaring the practice of altering the DNA of a human embryo “morally permissible” under certain circumstances.
类似的还有几内亚湾和印度洋的海盗行为（尤其是索马里沿岸）已经威胁到了欧洲的海上活动，包括其大规模的海上商业贸易。	Similarly, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea and the Indian Ocean, particularly along the coast of Somalia, threatens Europe’s maritime activities, including its extensive sea-borne commerce.
即便如此，因为哈瓦那协议在直面真相的同时并未完全回避正义，我们也不能否认这份协议的签署是一种历史性的创新。	Nonetheless, the accord signed in Havana is historic and innovative, because it emphasizes truth-telling without eschewing justice altogether.
和2017年不同，如今美元正在升值，这将导致美国贸易赤字进一步加大，一如既往认为自己正确的特朗普将把矛头指向他国，采取更多保护主义政策。	And, unlike in 2017, the US dollar is now strengthening, which will lead to an even larger US trade deficit and more protectionist policies as Trump, assuming he remains true to form, blames other countries.
因而，一项关键的变革就是区分开国际货币基金组织的金融措施和它的分析性职能之间的差别，尤其是对汇率和其他全球金融风险源头的监督。	Thus, a key change should be to distinguish between the IMF’s financial measures and its analytical functions, especially the surveillance of exchange rates and other sources of global financial risk.
中国至今还未能勇敢面对伪满帝国与其内战的历史，更不用说公开有关毛泽东决定派遣将近一百万士兵奔赴朝鲜战争的秘密文件。	China has still failed to face up to the history of Manchukuo and its civil war, not to mention opening the secret files concerning Mao Zedong’s decision to send almost a million soldiers into the Korean War.
巴勒斯坦领导人希望特朗普 — — 一位沉溺于他的遗产中的商人 — — 最终能够拿出必要的决心，使出美国总统的“洪荒之力”确保“最终协议 ” 。	Palestinian leaders hope that Trump, a businessman obsessed with his legacy, will finally display the needed resolve, using the full clout of the US presidency to secure the “ultimate deal.”

藏身于由高能源价格带来的政治安全垫后面的俄罗斯领导人们有理由认为风水轮流转，西方的“我们”更需要俄罗斯，反之则不然。	Russia’s leaders, tucked behind the political safety cushion provided by high energy prices, rightly feel that time is working in their favor, that “we” in the West need Russia more than Russia needs us.
相反，普京承认发生了大屠杀，但宣称化学武器存量都掌握在叛军控制地区，它们要么是有意漏出，目的是抹黑政府；要么是因为政府军轰炸而泄露。	Putin, by contrast, admits that the massacre happened, but claims that the stock of chemical weapons was in rebel-held territory and was released either deliberately, to discredit the regime, or accidentally by government bombing.
单单在今年，这些自诩为道德卫士的人就洗劫了酒吧和夜总会，袭击了美国和丹麦大使馆，还在《花花公子》首期发行后用石块砸他们的办公大楼。 这些事件警方只不过偶尔干预了一下。	This year alone, these self-appointed moral vigilantes have ransacked bars and nightclubs, attacked the American and Danish embassies, and stoned the offices of Playboy after its first edition – all with only occasional protests from the police.
事实上，当不平等性加剧时，民主会遭到打击，因此，美国在一项著名的世界民主排名中成绩下滑也许并不值得大惊小怪。	In fact, when inequality rises, democracy suffers, which is why the demotion of the US in one prominent ranking of the world’s democracies is not particularly surprising.
比如，本着教学质量越高学习效果越好的理念，渣打银行正在与瓦尔基环球教育集团基金会（Varkey GEMS Foundation）合作出资培训乌干达的学校教师。	For example, Standard Chartered, in partnership with the Varkey GEMS Foundation, is funding the training of school teachers in Uganda, based on the belief that higher-quality teaching will lead to better learning outcomes.
具体来讲，我们必须明确北大西洋公约的第5条适用于立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚和波兰 — — 它们都是美国依然领导的军事联盟成员国。	In particular, we must make clear that Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty applies to Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Poland – all members of the military alliance that the US still leads.
而中国国家主席习近平利用本月召开的中共十九大会议将更多的权力从各省转移到了北京的中央政府，从而进一步巩固了自身的权力。	And Chinese President Xi Jinping used this month’s 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China to consolidate his position further, by shifting more power from the provinces to the central government in Beijing.
上海 — — 中国的“两会 ” （ 每年三月召开的一年一度的全国人民代表大会和中国人民政治协商会议）一直吸引着全球的目光。	SHANGHAI – China’s “Two Sessions” – the annual gatherings of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference held every March – have always drawn global attention.
从2007年到2009年10月，美国失去了近800万个工作岗位，就业人口率从63%下降到58.5 % 。	From 2007 to October 2009, the United States lost nearly eight million jobs, which reduced the employment-population ratio from 63% to 58.5%.
由我担任总裁的惠康基金会（Wellcome Trust）投资了数亿美元用于研究这些机制、改善诊断和创造新药。	The Wellcome Trust, which I lead, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into researching these mechanisms, improving diagnoses, and creating new drugs.
在欧洲，欧盟的财政规则是问题所在，而欧盟委员会 — — 原则上它是欧盟的看门狗 — — 应该在问题没有得到重视时大声吠叫。	In Europe’s case, the European Union’s fiscal rules are at issue, and the Commission – in principle the EU’s watchdog – should bark loudly when they are flouted.
页岩气燃烧时还会释放二氧化碳，尽管页岩气比煤炭的含碳量低一半，并且对美国将碳排放量减至20世纪90年代中期水平居功至伟。	And shale gas emits CO2 when burned, even though it has half the carbon content of coal and has played a significant role in cutting US carbon emissions to mid-1990’s levels.
但如果你采取了英国模式，那么基础水平将决定最后结果的差异；英国的私人医疗供给程度相对较低，从本质上说是一套公共制度。	But if one adopts the UK model, the level of the base makes all the difference; given the relatively small role of private health-care provision in the UK, the country has what is essentially a public system.
较少得到讨论的是他所谓的“子孙锁链 ” （ Posterity-chainer’s device ） 。	Less frequently discussed is what he calls “the Posterity-chainer’s device.”
与危机爆发前10年3.6%的增长趋势相比，过去18个季度实际消费需求的年均增长率仅有可怜的0.7 % 。	Over the last 18 quarters, annualized growth in real consumer demand has averaged a mere 0.7%, compared to a 3.6% growth trend in the decade before the crisis erupted.
那么，在一个两院制体系内，它可能被看作Jacques Delors所称的“国家联邦”框架内的某种“国家议会 ” 。	It could then be seen, in a bicameral system, as a kind of “Chamber of Nations” within the framework of what Jacques Delors called a “federation of nation states.”
最近 ， “ 哥本哈根共识”计划聚集了一些世界顶尖的经济学家来商议如何在这个资源有限的世界为我们这个星球贡献最大的利益。	Recently, the Copenhagen Consensus project gathered some of the world’s leading economists to decide how to do the most good for the planet in a world of finite resources.
日本步履蹒跚的复苏可能因为其与中国的领土冲突升级而夭折。 中国是日本商品的主要市场，并且深入融入了日本企业的供应链中。	Japan’s somewhat fragile recovery could be derailed by an escalation of its territorial conflict with China, which is both a major market for Japanese goods and deeply integrated into Japanese firms’ supply chains.
此外，德国认为有必要整合欧洲在其他全球机构（如国际货币基金组织和世界银行）的投票权、减少其席位，以便为新兴大国创造空间。	Moreover, Germany recognizes the need to consolidate Europe’s voting power and reduce the number of European seats in other global institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to make room for emerging powers.
适用于老年人的肺炎球菌疫苗主要有两种 — — 23价肺炎球菌多糖疫苗（PPV23）和肺炎球菌结合疫苗（PCV13 ） — —都可以控制肺炎球菌传染病。	Two main types of pneumococcal vaccine available for older adults – the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) – could ameliorate the situation.
当前的民粹主义反弹也部分根源于这一信念，而且不是完全没有道理的，这种情况解释了近几十年来的许多经济决策。	Part of today’s populist backlash is rooted in the belief, not entirely unjustified, that this scenario describes much economic policymaking in recent decades.
更有甚之，经济学家不愿意将自己的质疑和大众分享，更不用说对社会大众的“教诲 ” ， 没有一个经济学家会认为自己的模式是完全正确的。	Furthermore, economists have been reluctant to share their intellectual doubts with the public, lest they “empower the barbarians.” No economist can be entirely sure that his preferred model is correct.
在墨尔本的澳大利亚网球公开赛赛场上，罗杰·费德勒，塞蕾娜·威廉姆斯等球星共同组织了一场表演赛，筹得了 60 万美元。	In Melbourne for the Australian Open, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and other stars held an exhibition match that led to donations of $600,000.
将2,4-D划为可能的致癌物忽略了世界各地卫生部门、包括联合国世卫/粮农组织联合农药残留会议（JMPR）所进行的大规模分析和研究。	Classifying 2,4-D as a cancer risk to humans ignores extensive research and analysis conducted by health authorities worldwide, including the United Nations WHO/FAO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residue (JMPR).
此外，如果能源价格的上涨是渐进式的，那么那些支持减少化石燃料消耗的环境和国家安全的论据将准备得更加充分。	In addition, the environmental and national-security arguments in favor of discouraging fossil-fuel consumption work better if the increase in energy prices is phased in gradually.
事实上，我们认为今后15年贫困人口的生活改善将超过以往任何时候 — — 而且他们的生活改善也会超过其他人的幅度。	Indeed, we think their lives will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history – and that their lives will improve more than anyone else’s.
奖励成功的公司是资本主义的基本理念—一个被Joseph Schumpeter称作“创造性破坏”的动态过程。	Rewarding successful ventures is the basic idea of capitalism – a dynamic process that Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction.”
国家的现任领导人被指犯下了战争罪，这还是第一次。 全世界的反应主要分做两种：有些人欢呼这一举措是向着国际正义迈出的一大步，还有些人指责这是殖民主义。	This is the first time that a sitting head of state has been indicted for war crimes, with reaction around the world mainly divided between those who hailed the move as a great step for international justice and those who condemned it as colonialism.
现在人们担心的不再是它们是否置身度外，而是其经济可能会陷入比处于次贷危机震中的那些国家所遭受的更严重的危机中。	The fear is no longer that they will be unable to insulate themselves. It is that their economies could be dragged into much deeper crises than those that will be experienced at the epicenter of the sub-prime debacle.
与此同时，政府已经扩大了对工人其他形式的社会保护，同时全力推行旨在促进创新和生产率增长的行业政策，进而实现了该国在全球价值链中的地位上移。	At the same time, the government has expanded other forms of social protections for workers, all while pursuing industrial policies geared toward boosting innovation and productivity growth, thus moving the country up the global value chain.
事实上，社会党已经开始用他们不是什么，而不是他们是什么来区分自己，打出了“既不是马克龙，也不是梅朗雄”的口号，其中后者是极左翼的让-卢克·梅朗雄（Jean-Luc Mélenchon ） 。	In fact, the Socialists have started distinguishing themselves not by what they are, but by what they are not, touting the line, “neither Macron nor Mélenchon” (a reference to the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon).
如果特朗普兑现其撕毁贸易协定和单方面实施惩罚性关税的承诺，现有的全球贸易体制将彻底瓦解，而中国将成为最大的受害者之一。	Should Trump make good on his threat to tear up trade agreements and unilaterally impose punitive tariffs, the existing global trading regime will unravel, with China as one of the biggest casualties.
除了退出跨太平洋合作伙伴关系，他还表示要重新谈判北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA ） ， 并威胁要向中国进口品征收高额关税。	Beyond withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he has suggested renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and threatened to impose high tariffs on Chinese imports.
不管是我们选择吃些什么，还是进行多少锻炼，或者评估身体遇到某种特殊状况的可能性，在数字上都可以真实而迅速的反应出来。	Whether we are choosing what to eat or how much to exercise, or trying to assess our chances of a specific condition, the numbers make it feel real and immediate.
此外，尽管广受捐赠者喜爱的小额信贷、正式土地所有权和执政改革等方案有时的确改善了穷人的生存条件，但并没有显著改善贫困。	Moreover, while the programs that most donors like – such as micro-credit, formalization of land titles, and governance reforms – have sometimes helped to ameliorate the conditions facing the poor, they have not reduced poverty significantly.
当法国禁止在该国的学校里披戴HIJAB头巾时，它用这方头巾来代表西方的普世价值，其中包括妇女的恰当的地位。	When France banned headscarves in schools, it used the hijab as a proxy for Western values in general, including the appropriate status of women.
与此同时，来自若干海湾国家的政府和私人民众 — — 包括科威特、卡塔尔、沙特和阿联酋 — — 都与努斯拉阵线密切合作。	At the same time, governments and private citizens from several Gulf countries – including Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE – have close ties with al-Nusra.
最有可能的是南方古猿阿法种，而如果露西不是素食者，那么她的后代 — — 我们 — — 很有可能一直是杂食动物。	The most likely candidate is Australopithecus afarensis, and if Lucy was no vegetarian, then her descendants – us – have very likely always been omnivores.
但这些领导人很快认识到他们的解决方案并不比其他人的更优秀，而把权力握在手里的最佳方式就是把所有问题都赖在别国人头上。	Such leaders soon learn that their solutions are no better than anybody else’s and decide that the best way to remain in power is by blaming all problems on foreigners.
华盛顿—自从“数据革命”一词出现以来，涌现出大量动作定义、发展和实施日程以改变发展统计数据的收集、使用和分配。	WASHINGTON, DC – Since the term “data revolution” was introduced, there has been a flurry of activity to define, develop, and implement an agenda to transform the collection, use, and distribution of development statistics.
问题不在于各国彼此案中监视（所有国家都这么做 ） ， 而在于美国搜集情报做法的程度和美国对盟友的态度，这才是最危险的。	The problem is not that countries spy on each other (they all do). Rather, it is the extent of US intelligence gathering and America’s attitude toward allies that is most damaging.
相比之下，如果在未来十年内能每年拨出30亿美元来鼓励使用蚊帐和室内无害DDT喷雾，以及资助有效的新型综合疗法，就可以在10年内使疟疾受灾人口减半。	In comparison, spending $3 billion annually on mosquito nets, environmentally safe indoor DDT sprays, and subsidies for effective new combination therapies could halve the total number of those infected within one decade.
虽然贸易谈判需要谨慎从事以避免参与者在政治上哗众取宠，但跨太平洋伙伴关系谈判目前的遮遮掩掩妨碍了人们了解重要的人权观点。	Although trade negotiations require discretion to avoid political grandstanding by participants, the secrecy that currently surrounds the TPP talks is preventing important human-rights arguments from being aired.
帕萨迪纳—近一个世纪前，我们第一次发现了银河之外的世界，此后不出十年，就第一次提出了宇宙正在扩张的理论。	PASADENA – Almost a century ago, the first galaxy beyond our own was discovered, and within a decade the theory that the universe is expanding was first proposed.
发自北京 — — 自美国总统奥巴马决定从阿富汗撤军以来，全球开始对中国将在这个饱经战乱之国的未来中（如果会的话）扮演何种角色兴趣大增。	BEIJING – Ever since US President Barack Obama decided to begin withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan, global interest in what role (if any) China will play in determining that war-ravaged country’s future has grown dramatically.
这导致某些人，比如萨特，积极捍卫斯大林和古拉格；其他人，像安德烈·马尔罗，自愿供职查尔斯·戴高乐政府；还有人在后来成为以色列及其政策的无条件捍卫者。	This led some, like Sartre, to defend Stalin and the Gulag; others, like André Malraux, formed part of Charles de Gaulle’s government; and still others, somewhat later, became unconditional defenders of Israel and its policies.
许多德国人把最近的批评潮视为德国因为成功遭受妒忌的信号，他们愤怒地驳斥说，德国从未试图赢得不公平的竞争优势。	Many Germans view the latest wave of criticism as a sign that others are merely envious of their country’s success, and they have angrily refuted arguments that Germany has tried to gain an unfair competitive advantage.
当然，沙特阿拉伯和伊朗 — — 还有土耳其，它刚刚加入到争夺地区影响力的竞争中 — — 都不想要直接冲突。	Of course, neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran – or Turkey, which has also joined the competition for regional influence – is seeking a direct confrontation.
虽然必须实现跨境资本流动及汇率、利率市场化以保持经济增长，但是如果基准价格扭曲，这些改革将增加资产泡沫风险。	While cross-border capital flows and interest and exchange rates must be liberalized to maintain economic development, such reforms raise the risk of asset bubbles if implemented under distorted benchmark prices.
华盛顿—最近 ， 《 纽约时报》发表了一张头版照片，照片上，一艘叙利亚难民船在夕阳下的地中海上漂浮。 这张照片十分切题。	WASHINGTON, DC – A recent front-page photo in the New York Times of a boatload of Syrian refugees drifting on the Mediterranean Sea beneath an enormous setting sun could not have been more apt.
在中国，开办企业（排名第151 ） 、 纳税（派排名第122 ） 、 获得建筑许可（排名第179 ） 、 获得电力（排名第115）尤其困难。	It is particularly difficult to start a business in China (151st), pay taxes (122nd), obtain construction permits (179th), and get electricity (115th).
这场论战已经从精神病实验室和精神病诊所中扩散开来，出现在头版头条，触动立法改革，并影响到了民事诉讼和刑事审判的结果。	The controversy has spilled out of the psychology laboratories and psychiatric clinics, capturing headlines, motivating legislative changes, and affecting outcomes in civil lawsuits and criminal trials.
而由于无法有效地将正常沮丧以及反常行为和真正的失调区分开来，第五版手册的修改意见很可能大幅增加乱诊断行为 — — 而这却正是手册所试图避免的。	By failing to distinguish adequately normal distress and eccentricity from disorder, the DSM-5’s proposals threaten to increase dramatically the types of abuses that the DSM was designed to prevent.
对说服能力的系统性研究始于二战，因为美军意识到与被希特勒蛊惑的民族作战需要鼓舞军队士气，并说服民众支持战争。	The systematic study of persuasion began during World War II, when the US Army recognized that fighting a nation mesmerized by Hitler would require bolstering troop motivation and rallying popular support for the war.
最后，全球金融危机给美国经济造成了严重掣肘，加剧了立法者采取旨在提振国内GDP增长和创造就业岗位的政策的压力。	Finally, the global financial crisis put considerable strain on the US economy, intensifying pressure on lawmakers to undertake policies aimed at boosting domestic GDP growth and creating jobs.
听到这一消息我兴奋不已。 我在过去四年时间里一直奔波，为的是确保美国的关押和审讯政策符合法治，包括监督关塔纳摩湾的军事审判。	I was elated by the decision, having spent four years working on ensuring the rule of law in US detention and interrogation policy, including monitoring military commission trials at Guantánamo Bay.
它们的源头可以追溯到“乌姆甘达 ” （ Umuganda）的民间传统，每个月的某一天，包括总统在内的全体公民一起为土地除草，为街道打扫卫生，为最穷的人造房子。	They breathed life back into a civic tradition of Umuganda, where one day a month, citizens, including the president, gather together to weed their fields, clean their streets, and build homes for the poorest among them.
意大利物理学家亚历山德罗·伏特（Alessandro Volta）在 1800 年首次发明了电池，但又过了80多年人们才引入直流电作为电力传输的手段。	Volta first discovered electricity cells in 1800, but it took another eight decades to introduce direct current as a means of power transmission.
上个月，我向国际原子能机构理事会提出了关于强化不扩散机制的关键措施的建议 — — 即创立一家国际原子能机构低浓缩铀 (LEU)银行，以保证对那些需要核燃料来维持其核能反应堆运转的国家的供应。	Last month, I proposed a key measure to strengthen non-proliferation to the IAEA’s Board of Governors – establishing an IAEA bank of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to guarantee supplies to countries that need nuclear fuel for their power reactors.
“伊朗在国外的（军事和间谍）行动都是在政府不知情或未下令的情况下执行的…直到客机被劫，我们才知道有这个行动。	“[military and intelligence] operations outside the country are taking place without the government’s knowledge or orders....Only after an airplane is hijacked are we made aware of it.
哥伦比亚大学的 杰弗里·萨克斯（Jeffrey D. Sachs）指出，加强教育投资，以及更有效的财富再分配战略，是印尼政府必须关注的重点领域。	As Columbia University’s Jeffrey D. Sachsnoted, greater investment in education, and more effective wealth redistribution strategies, are the key areas that Indonesia’s government must focus on.
一位精神失常的人，带着二十多支高科技突击武器来到32层的酒店房间，向楼下参加音乐会的人群吐出死亡的火舌，造成大量人员伤亡，自己也饮弹自尽。	A deranged person lugs nearly two dozen high-tech assault weapons to a 32nd-floor hotel room to spray death upon concertgoers in a mass murder and suicide.
多年来，该地区主要国家 — — 其中包括沙特阿拉伯和卡塔尔等西方的宠儿 — — 实际上已经在向圣战份子缴纳保护费。	For years, key states in the region – some of them, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, darlings of the West – have essentially paid protection money to jihadists.
伦敦 — — 去年10月中国终止实施独生子女政策标志着37年偏离历史轨道的结束，上述偏离导致该国的人口老龄化进程提前了数十年。	LONDON – The announcement in October that China is terminating its one-child policy marks the end of a 37-year historical aberration that has accelerated the country’s demographic aging by decades.
就连人类孢疹病毒（Epstein-Barr virus）疫苗（可预防某些种类的淋巴癌）也获得了可喜的成果。	Even an Epstein-Barr virus vaccine, which would protect against some kinds of lymphoma, is achieving promising results.
这只有当实现评级机构的利润与选择他们的发行机构脱钩，并与为投资者所提供服务挂钩的时候才可能成为现实。	This can be done by making raters’ profits depend not on satisfying the issuers that select them, but on performing well for investors.
2014年仅有1%的难民得以重返家园，而多数流离失所者不是流亡数天或数月，而是数年或数十年，甚至一生都无法重返家园。	Just 1% of refugees were able to return home in 2014. The vast majority of those displaced spend not days or months in exile, but years or decades, even entire lifetimes.
在黎巴嫩，真主党设法压迫其更为温和的逊尼派穆斯林，基督教以及德鲁兹派（Druze）竞争对手，使他们顺从。	In Lebanon, Hezbollah has been trying to bully its more moderate Sunni Muslim, Christian, and Druze rivals into submission.
昨天是印度小说家萨尔曼·鲁西迪（Salman Rushdie ） ， 今天是阿尔及利亚小说家卡梅尔·达乌德（Kamel Daoud ） 。	Yesterday it was the Indian novelist Salman Rushdie; today it is the Algerian novelist Kamel Daoud.
约翰·麦凯恩力图以与众不同的方式来击败其它更为传统的共和党对手：他是坦率说出他内心所想的特立独行者，也是拥有老妇杀手般会意眼神的硬汉。	John McCain managed to defeat his more conventional Republican rivals by seeming to be totally different from them: a maverick who says what he damned well wants, a tough guy with the knowing wink of the old ladies’ man.
2007年10月，由苏格兰皇家银行（RBS ） 、 富通银行和西班牙国际银行（Banco Santander）收购了荷兰银行（ABN AMRO ） — —这是当时世界有史以来最大的银行收购案。	In October 2007, a consortium formed by the Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis, and Banco Santander acquired ABN AMRO – the world’s biggest bank takeover to date.
哈佛大学经济学家卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）说，一国需要五年时间才能从金融危机中走出。	The Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff say that it takes five years for a country to dig itself out of a financial crisis.
同时，人们普遍认为(除大多数编辑和新闻记者外 ) ， 大量的新闻窥探就是对新闻自由的滥用，其唯一目的是通过满足公众的欲望来提高发行量。	At the same time, it is widely acknowledged (except by most editors and journalists) that a great deal of media intrusion is simply an abuse of press freedom, with the sole aim of boosting circulation by feeding public prurience.
尽管亚洲国家在这方面已经有了长足的进步，但在非洲国家，生活在极端贫困中的人口却比1990年增长了1亿4千万。	Although good progress in meeting these goals has been made in Asia, in Africa there are now 140 million more people living in extreme poverty than there were in 1990.
虽然各方已经经历了数年的复杂协商，但在某些和侵略罪有关的关键事务方面，比如如何取得成员国同意以及如何启动案件方面都依然存在着深层次的不信任。	Despite years of complex negotiations, deep disagreements persist over key issues related to amending the statute on aggression, such as state consent and how cases would be initiated.
该理论认为只要所有经济部门都能充分了解所有可能出现的突发事件，那么除非出现某些超出现有经济学理论范畴之外的意外事件，否则系统性危机永远不会发生。	With economic agents supposedly possessing perfect information about all possible contingencies, systemic crises could never happen except as a result of accidents and surprises beyond the reach of economic theory.
事实上，在有PIM数据的36个月中，19个月的数值低于50，而这段时间中国制造业增长率平均为7.5 % 。	Indeed, for 19 out of the PMI’s 36 months of existence, the value has been below 50, while Chinese manufacturing growth has averaged 7.5%.
对许多人来说，出于名誉甚至身体安全的考虑，让她们形成了一种羞耻文化，不敢采取强烈的、有尊严的回应方式。	For many, fear of reputational or even physical harm has created a culture of shame that discourages a strong, dignified response.
习近平认为政府的合法性在很大程度上是一个包含持续传递的多项价值观，经济和社会进步，以及严格承诺将公共利益放在治理形式之上的集合。	Xi believes that a government’s legitimacy is mainly a function of consistently delivered values, together with economic and social progress, with strict commitment to the public interest taking precedence over the form of governance.
与此同时，建筑业中带有可重复要素（repeatable elements）的部分 — — 特别是大规模平价住房 — — 可以向制造业式的大规模生产系统变迁，从而克服许多低生产率的根源。	At the same time, the parts of the industry with repeatable elements – particularly large-scale affordable housing – could negate many of the root causes of low productivity by shifting toward a manufacturing-style system of mass production.
有些人可能以为近30年过去了，反应堆周围地区仍然是一片荒芜，偶尔可见世代遭受慢性辐射且基因受损的野生动物。	Some might expect that, nearly 30 years later, the area around the reactor remains a wasteland, sparsely populated by genetically damaged animals exposed to chronic radiation across multiple generations.
也得执行。 在澳大利亚，言论自由并没有宪法明文予以保护，法庭有更大的可能尊重民主选出的政府决定恰当平衡的权利。	In Australia, where freedom of expression is not given explicit constitutional protection, courts are much more likely to respect the right of democratically elected governments to strike the proper balance.
因为这种方式所赋予的就是根本性的平等，所以英国的体系在让不同身份的人更好地表达自己的观点方面比其他国家的体系做得更好。	Because fundamental equality is granted in this way, the British system manages to cope better than others do with a greater expression of distinctive identities.
一些人 — — 其实是很多人 — — 永远不会支持他；但作为总统，他有责任接触所有人并提出共同美国价��观的诉求。	Some – indeed many – will never support him; but it is his job, as president, to reach out to all and appeal to the country’s shared values.
美国的新保守主义者们已经把他们国家相当大的力量和道德权威浪费在和伊拉克那场无谓的战争上，心甘情愿地削弱了西方唯一的全球大国的力量。	America’s neo-conservatives have wasted a large part of their country’s power and moral authority in an unnecessary war in Iraq, willfully weakening the only global Western power.
欧洲的未来俄罗斯有着不可摆脱的联系，而美国已经背弃了欧洲，欧洲即便不能破除幻想，也应该意识到双方的利益不一致。	Europe’s future is inexorably linked to that of Russia, whereas America has turned its back on Europe, out of disinterest if not disillusion.
此外章程也指出，在中等教育中，保证“相关区域或少数族裔语言的教授 ” — —不一定非得设立其他科目 — — “作为课程的组成部分”就足够了。	Moreover, the charter states that, in secondary education, it is sufficient to guarantee “the teaching of the relevant regional or minority languages” – not necessarily other subjects – “as an integral part of the curriculum.”
2015年，移民为全球GDP增加了大约6.7万亿美元 — — 预计比让他们留在来源国的情形多出3万亿美元。	Migrants added roughly $6.7 trillion to global GDP in 2015 – some $3 trillion more than they are projected to have produced had they stayed in their countries of origin.
我们知道，土耳其军中有着庞大的居伦派（否则早先政府针对土耳其高级官员的举动 — — 所谓的艾尔格尼肯和铁锤案（Eregenekon and Sledgehammer cases ） — —也不会进行 ） 。	We know that there is a strong Gülenist presence in the military (without which the government’s earlier move against senior Turkish officers – the so-called Eregenekon and Sledgehammer cases – could not have been mounted).
最佳的补救措施就是为低工资就业提供补贴给雇佣全职低工资工人的雇主，并就该雇员的公司工资成本加以调整。	The best remedy is a subsidy for low-wage employment, paid to employers for every full-time low-wage worker they hire and calibrated to the employee’s wage cost to the firm.
朱棣文原先是伯克利大学和斯坦福大学的物理学教授，劳伦斯·伯克利国家实验室主任。 而骆家辉是前华盛顿州州长，长期以来一直致力于中美贸易关系正常化。	Chu is a former Berkeley and Stanford professor of physics and head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, while Locke is a former Washington State governor and a long-time supporter of US-China commercial exchanges.
由于合约之间彼此关联，一份合同的违约可能影响一系列承诺的兑现，如雪崩一般不断扩大，进而“破坏市场体系正常运转所需要的整个正式与非正式合约的网络系统 ” 。	Because contracts are linked with each other, one default can trigger an avalanche of broken promises, “[making] it possible to destroy virtually the entire web of formal and informal contracts which the market system requires for its functioning.”
美国的社会契约已饱受摧残，并可能在即将到来的总统选举中造成重大影响，因为选民纷纷对日益难以企及的美国梦表示愤懑之情。	The social contract in the US has frayed badly, and this is likely to play an important role in the upcoming presidential election, as voters express anger that the American Dream is increasingly out of reach.
正如经济学家尼古拉斯·卡尔多（Nicholas Kaldor）在很早以前指出的那样，由于制造业比服务业的规模收益更高，制造业出口商往往会比服务出口商表现更佳。	As the economist Nicholas Kaldor pointed out long ago, because manufacturing has higher returns to scale than services, manufacturing exporters tend to beat service exporters.
此外，国际援助的大批流入也令以色列的占领行动成为有史以来最惬意的：他们控制了当地的土地和人口，却无需背上相应的经济负担。	Moreover, massive inflows of international aid make Israel’s occupation one of the most convenient in world history; the Israelis control the land and its population without having to bear the financial burden of direct rule.
其中韩圆（won）兑美��跌幅最大，自年初到2月以来已经下跌了3 % （ 但这是在经历一个漫长的升值趋势之后 ） 。	The South Korean won has experienced the largest slide, with a loss of 3% from the start of the year to the beginning of February (though this comes in the wake of a protracted upward trend).
这一观点 — — 其具有牢固的神经科学、心理学、人类学和社会学基础 — — 意味着个体在决定其身份中具有相当的自由。	This idea – which is firmly rooted in neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, and sociology – implies that an individual has significant latitude in shaping his or her identities.
目前，最佳前景似乎是罗马历史学家塔西佗所描述的 — — “他们制造了一片沙漠，他们管它叫和平 。 ”	At the moment, the best outlook appears to be that described by the Roman historian Tacitus – “they make a desert, they call it peace.”
中国更是只有不到40 % ， 远低于世界主要经济体的平均水平，也低于处于可比发展阶段的亚洲经济体，虽然近年来其人均消费平均年增长率接近7 % 。	In China, it is less than 40% – far below the norm for the world’s major economies and for other Asian economies at a comparable stage of development – despite nearly 7% annual average growth in China’s per capita consumption in recent years.
事实上在逐渐走向前十三个熊市前高点月的那些年中，股价波动值也是低于平均水平的，虽然当前的水平低于这些时期3.1%的平均水平。	In fact, stock-price volatility was lower than average in the year leading up to the peak month preceding the 13 previous US bear markets, though today’s level is lower than the 3.1% average for those periods.
目前尤其如此：随着叙利亚战事日益平息，沙特领导的逊尼派轴心急切地想要捞回在叙利亚的损失，因此正在将黎巴嫩当作下一个战场。	This is particularly true now: as the fighting in Syria subsides, the Saudi-led Sunni axis is eager to compensate for its losses there, and thus is pushing Lebanon as the next battlefield.
2015年11月15日，位于柏林韦尔德市场大街的德国外交部下属移民指挥中心追踪了从希腊到德国的每一个潜在过境点的难民人流。	On November 15, 2015, a migration command center in the German Foreign Ministry on Werderscher Markt in Berlin was tracking refugee flows at every potential border crossing on the route from Greece to Germany.
一份北爱尔兰“阿尔斯特煎蛋 ” — —鸡蛋、培根、猪肉香肠、黑布丁、土豆、苏打面包再配上油炸番茄 — — 搭配一杯茶？	A Northern Irish “Ulster fry-up” – eggs, bacon, pork sausage, black pudding, potato and soda bread, and a fried tomato – with a cup of tea?
只需要很少的现金投入，甚至在根本上不需要花钱，我们就本能够保全自然，并且进而保护人类自身生命和生计的基础。	For a very low cash outlay – and perhaps none at all on balance – we could conserve nature and thus protect the basis of our own lives and livelihoods.
卡梅伦说准的第二点是他说“从欧元区危机中走来的欧盟 … … 会因拯救欧元所需要的措施而发生超越认知的改变 。 ”	Second, Cameron was right to say that “the European Union that emerges from the eurozone crisis … will be transformed beyond recognition by the measures needed to save the eurozone.”
然而对此的执法不力令国内企业在很大程度上忽视了这些成本，到了2008年当局开始大力纠察缴费率，让企业倍感压力。	Yet weak enforcement long meant that domestic firms largely ignored those costs. Then, in 2008, the authorities began to enforce the contribution rate vigorously, which squeezed firms.
我并不是说橙色革命的领导者都是完人，或者尤先科和我本人之间的分裂并没有让许多在2004年年终以及2005年年初冬天在基辅街头支持我们的人心寒。	I do not claim that the Orange Revolution’s protagonists are paragons, and that the split between Yushchenko and me has not disheartened many of those who stood with us in the streets of Kyiv in the winter of 2004-2005.
奥地利学派自由主义者：哈耶克（Friedrich von Hayek）和米塞斯（Ludwig von Mises）的支持者对圣诞节有两大反对点。	Austrian School libertarians: Supporters of Friedrich von Hayek and Ludwig von Mises have two major objections to Christmas.
如果候选人反复宣扬穆斯林的危险性，那么就像英国刚刚脱欧和特朗普刚刚当选时那样，出现反穆斯林仇恨犯罪激增的状况人们也不应感到惊讶。	When candidates repeatedly call Muslims dangerous, for example, no one should be surprised by a surge in anti-Muslim hate crimes, as has occurred in the wake of both the Brexit vote and Trump’s victory.
尼日利亚有句俗话 ， “ 你有一个朝九晚五的工作，一个晚五晚九的工作，和一个周末开工的工作 ” — —很形象地描述了分层工作的环境。	A Nigerian saying – “you have a 9 to 5, a 5 to 9 and a weekend job” – aptly describes the environment of layered work.
阿拉木图宣言的持久遗产是一个共识：卫生只有通过好科学、可靠经济学和破除社会不公的行动相结合，才有可能得到改善。	The Declaration of Alma-Ata’s lasting legacy is the consensus that health can be improved only with a combination of good science, sound economics, and action against social injustices.
此外，由于欧盟继续坚持一些让《京都议定书》不能正常产生实效的根本性问题，它所迈出的新步伐可能更是不智。	Moreover, in continuing the fundamental problems besetting the crippled Kyoto Protocol, the EU has essentially gone and made a worse deal.
就我所见而论，最佳的局部解释是哲学家欧内斯特·戈尔纳（Ernest Gellner）对左翼学界的冷静观察。	The best partial explanation that I have seen starts with the philosopher Ernest Gellner’s cruel observation about left-wing academics.
还有一个在小说和电影里反复出现的，更为不祥的问题：我们是否将不得不保卫自己的文明，使之免遭出自我们之手的智能机器屠戮？	A more ominous question is familiar from novels and movies: Will we have to defend our civilization against intelligent machines of our own creation?
去年11月，在几年西非国家中央银行（Central Bank of West African States）成立50周年的会议上，塞内加尔总统麦基·萨尔（Macky Sall）要求削减利率。	Last November, at a conference marking the Central Bank of West African States’ 50th anniversary, Senegalese President Macky Sall pleaded for an interest-rate reduction.
ECT的批评者似乎认为如果他们不抓住任何一个机会反对使用它，ECT的支持者就会将其使用在不需要它的人身上。	ECT’s critics seem to think that if they do not protest against its use at every opportunity, its advocates will inflict it on people who do not need it.
哈佛大学经济学家劳伦斯·萨默斯（Lawrence Summers）认为原因是“长期停滞 ” ， 这个词的始作俑者是20世纪30年代的阿尔文·汉森（Alvin Hansen ） ， 用来描述长期的需求萎靡和有利可图的投资机会不足。	Harvard University economist Lawrence Summers points to “secular stagnation,” a term coined by the economist Alvin Hansen in the 1930s to describe long-term tepid demand and insufficient opportunity for profitable investment.
第六，政府负债率的上升会最终导致实际利率的上升，而实际利率的上升会压缩私人开支，甚至会导致国家再融资的风险。	Sixth, rising government debt ratios will eventually lead to increases in real interest rates that may crowd out private spending and even lead to sovereign refinancing risk.
因为监管者的决策会影响个人的财产权 — — 而它们的行动或者疏忽可能令纳税人陷入援助银行的圈套 — — 因此政府，议会和法院都必须要小心管好这只看门狗。	Because supervisors’ decisions affect individuals’ property rights – and their actions or omissions can put taxpayers on the hook to bail out banks – governments, parliaments, and the courts are bound to hold the watchdogs on a tight leash.
而在新计划启动期间，一位美国官员引用了哥本哈根共识的研究以表明营养强化是“对海地发展最有效的投资之一 ” 。	And during the launch of the new program, one US official cited Copenhagen Consensus research to show that fortification is “one of the most efficient investments in Haiti’s development.”
但是，要填补数字差距，需要更全面的全国性数字战略，该战略要以数字基础设施投资为重点，而不是想过去那样以实体基础设施投资为重点。	But, to close the digital divide, a more comprehensive national digital strategy is needed, one that emphasizes digital infrastructure investment, rather than just physical infrastructure investment, as in the past.
当然，战士也可以保证向民主的过渡，正如他们四十年前在我的祖国葡萄牙在推翻萨拉扎/卡尔塔诺（Salazar/Caetano）独裁后做的那样。	Of course, it is possible for soldiers to assure a transition to democracy, as they did four decades ago in my homeland, Portugal, following their overthrow of the Salazar/Caetano dictatorship.
美国前国家安全顾问兹比格涅夫·布热津斯基不久前提出坚决反对军事行动，并提出战略要继续制裁并扩大威慑。	Former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski recently argued strongly against military action, proposing, instead, a strategy that would continue sanctions and extend deterrence.
但支持者希望实现其永久化，称当时只是为了规避立法过程中民主党保证财政合理性的无效的程序性规定才将其确定为临时性措施。	Although their supporters wanted to make them permanent, claiming that they were temporary allowed for the circumvention of procedural requirements in the legislative process that Democrats had created in a vain effort to guarantee fiscal sanity.
但正如他们在过去几个月的举动所体现的那样，他们并不知道如何下手去解决这些问题 — — 这在金融市场和人民群众之中造成了极大的担忧。	But, as their efforts over the last several months have highlighted, they are uncertain as to how to go about fixing it – a fact that is generating significant anxiety in financial markets and among the general public.
他的保护主义立场将带来全球贸易战，他坚持盟友自己为自己的防务买单将导致危险的核扩散，同时削弱美国在世界舞台上的领导力。	His protectionist stance could incite a global trade war, and his insistence that allies pay for their own defense could lead to dangerous nuclear proliferation, while diminishing American leadership on the world stage.
他们为厄瓜多尔的科雷亚淘汰前任设立的石油稳定基金而击节叫好，并全力支持查韦斯借贷五倍的公共外债，而不是存钱以备不时之需。	They applauded when Rafael Correa of Ecuador eliminated an oil stabilization fund he inherited and when Chávez, rather than putting money aside for a rainy day, quintupled the public external debt.
发自普林斯顿 — — 最近，因制造了1988年洛克比空难而被判刑的唯一一人，阿布德尔·巴赛特·梅格拉希获释出狱，引起了极大的愤慨。	PRINCETON – The recent release of Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, the only person convicted of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, sparked outrage.
在首次感染过程中，病毒基因组的一个小碎片 — — 一种签名 — — 被复制进入CRISPR基因组岛（一片亲代基因组文本之外的额外的基因组 ） 。	In the course of a first infection, a small fragment of the viral genome – a kind of signature – is copied into the CRISPR genomic island (an extra piece of genome, outside of the parent genome text).
而中国跟美国一样，可以通过提高能源利用率和电动汽车来减少二氧化碳排放，但也要考虑到自身经济是煤依赖型经济这一具体情况。	Similarly, China, like the US, can reduce CO2 emissions through increased energy efficiency and a new fleet of electric vehicles. But China must consider the question from the vantage point of a coal-dependent economy.
我们非常需要药理创新的结核病药品，不仅仅用来治疗多充抗药性结核病，也用来缩短药物敏感性结核病的治���时间。	New TB drugs with novel mechanisms of action are badly needed, not only to treat multi-drug resistant TB, but also to shorten the treatment time for drug-sensitive TB.
这种紧张在1995年后得到了缓解，主要是因为俄裔分裂势力内部出现了分化，而莫斯科当时也面临着车臣出现分裂的紧张局势而顾不上支持他们。	They subsided after 1995 largely because the Russian separatists were divided, and Moscow, facing separatist pressures in Chechnya, showed little inclination to support them.
而这个网络的破碎和肢解 — — 通过对金融机构的恐慌和敌意，低价甩卖资产，信贷紧缩等 — — 将成为对金融监管这和货币主管部门的噩梦。	The unraveling of such a network – through panic and runs against financial institutions, asset fire sales, credit crunches, and the like – then becomes a nightmare for financial supervisors and monetary authorities alike.
发自巴塞尔 — — 任何对巴拉克·奧巴马八年美国总统历程的评估都应从2009 年 1 月 20 日他首次就职开始。	BASEL – Any assessment of Barack Obama’s eight-year US presidency should start at the beginning: his first inauguration, on January 20, 2009.
在此基础上崛起了一个由债券市场和银行组成的庞然大物，不但降低了金融成本，还有助于加速经济增长的速度。	On this bedrock rose an imposing edifice of bond markets and banks that drove down the cost of finance, and thus sped up the rate of economic growth.
尽管越来越多的人担心中国的企业债务（目前接近GDP的170 % ） 及其摆脱中等收入陷阱的能力，但迅速的数字经济革命将让中国经济继续在价值链中向上攀升。	Despite growing concerns about China’s corporate debt – which is now close to 170% of GDP – and its ability to escape the middle-income trap, rapid digitization will allow the Chinese economy to continue moving up the value chain.
事实上，默多克、柯氏兄弟和他们的盟友在否认科学事实方面与大烟草公司是一丘之貉，甚至他们聘请的专家都是同一批人。	Indeed, Murdoch, the Koch Brothers, and their allies behave just like Big Tobacco in denying scientific truths; even use the same experts for hire.
甚至美国和欧洲也未能幸免，大对冲基金长期资本管理公司（LTCM）的倒闭让人们十分担心其他许多金融机构的安全。	Even the US and Europe were not immune, with the collapse of the major hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) fueling anxiety about the viability of many other financial institutions.
尽管大部分伊朗民众愿意与美国修好，但对于伊朗国内的强硬派来说，对美国的仇恨已经成为了伊斯兰共和国定义的一个重要组成部分。	While a large majority of Iranians want to make amends with the US, for Iran’s hardliners, enmity toward the US has become a central part of the Islamic Republic’s identity.
这样的一个协定必须是全面并且雄心勃勃的，同时，它也必须为减排、各国的适应、融资以及技术转让设定明确的目标。	It must be comprehensive and ambitious, and it must set clear targets for emission reductions, adaptation, financing, and technology transfer.
检测“引力子 ” — —形成部分引力场的假象粒子 — — 需要银河系那么大的粒子对撞机或质量与木星相当的检测器。	"Detecting a “graviton"" – the hypothetical particle making up part of a gravitational field – would require a particle collider the size of the Milky Way or a detector with a mass of the planet Jupiter."
事实上，到2020年，世界将面临3 000—4 000万大学学历工人缺口和9 500万低技能工人潜在过剩。	Indeed, the world faces a potential shortage of 30-40 million college-educated workers in 2020, and a potential surplus of 95 million low-skilled workers.
美国剑桥 — “ 生活 ， ” 奥斯卡·王尔德（Oscar Wilde）有句名言 ， “ 模仿艺术远多于艺术模仿生活 。 ”	CAMBRIDGE – “Life,” Oscar Wilde famously said, “imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life.”
比较全面地说，普京领导下的俄罗斯在能源生产方面已经成为了一个大国，但是这看起来难以持久，因为用于维护和改善油田和天然气田的投资持续不足。	On a grander scale, Putin’s Russia has become a great power in terms of energy production, but that looks to be temporary, as scant investment is being made to maintain and improve the oil and gas fields.
发自马萨诸塞州牛顿市 — — 12月7日，来自世界贸易组织159个成员国的代表达成了WTO 成立19年以来的第一个多边贸易协议。	NEWTON, MASSACHUSETTS – On December 7, representatives from the World Trade Organization’s 159 member countries reached agreement on the first multilateral trade deal in the WTO’s 19-year history.
中国的储蓄将随着其GDP增速回落而下降，中国当局放松了对银行存款利率的管制，中国经济也在向消费再平衡。	China’s saving will come down as its GDP growth slows, the authorities decontrol interest rates on bank deposit, and the economy rebalances toward consumption.
令人吃惊的一点是卢拉，作为一名前工党领袖，一直以来十分左派。 在商业和金融圈内，即使不能说遭到鄙视，但也有很多人反对他。	The surprise here is that Lula, a former labor leader who had been on the far left, was widely opposed, if not despised, in business and financial circles.
反抗点燃了民主改革的火花，我们也受到伊拉克北部同族成功赢得政治自主权并建立起充满活力的民主国家的鼓舞。	This ignited the spark for democratic reform, and we were spurred on by the knowledge that our kinsmen had won political autonomy in northern Iraq and were creating a vibrant democracy.
与此同时，在新兴经济体 — — 特别是所谓的金砖国家（巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非 ） — —新兴中产阶级正在改变饮食结构，模仿发达国家中产阶级。	Meanwhile, in emerging economies – especially the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) – members of the burgeoning middle class are changing their diets to resemble those of their rich-country counterparts.
但通过克服差异、共同努力击败伊斯兰国、征服埃博拉，我们正在强化对基于针对共同问题的集体解决方案的世界秩序的支持。	But by overcoming differences and coordinating efforts to defeat the Islamic State and conquer Ebola, we are reinforcing support for a world order grounded in collective solutions to common problems.
心理学家Paul Rozin展示了厌恶（正如达尔文起初所注意到的那样）是一种让我们不至于食用腐肉的进化改变。 因此这种情绪是由动物及其排泄物自然引发的。	The psychologist Paul Rozin has shown how disgust, as Charles Darwin first noted, is an evolutionary adaptation that deters us from bad meat, so it is naturally triggered by animals and animal waste products.
从拉合尔到卢萨卡的各个地方药房仍在以不同价格出售各种牌子的同一款药品；店主需要对药品的好处和短处做出权威说明。	Local pharmacists from Lahore to Lusaka continue to sell a variety of brands of the same drug at different prices; and shopkeepers are called upon to give a candid opinion of their benefits and shortcomings.
人民党批评国大党“讨好”印度的少数民族，顽固坚持印度爱国联盟阵线，人民党受到印度社会一些顽固偏执势力的支持。	The BJP, which accuses Congress of “appeasing” India’s minorities, hews to a staunchly Hindu-chauvinist line, and has received support from some of the most bigoted and intolerant sections of Indian society.
我是小组中唯一的欧洲成员，在我看来，最重要的信息应该是美国不可继续如现在那样将自己视为“不可或缺的力量 ” ， 而是将自己视为“不可或缺的伙伴 ” 。	"From my perspective as the group's only European member, the overarching message should be that the US must conceive of itself not as “the indispensable power,"" as it now does, but as “the indispensable partner."""
就像他自己在自传 《父亲的梦想》 中所说的那样，第一次访问父亲的出生地肯尼亚让他比以往更强烈地感受到自己属于美国，而并不属于非洲。	As he explained in his memoir Dreams from My Father , visiting his father’s native Kenya for the first time made him feel more American – and less African – than ever.
但是使用生物燃料来对付气候变化却是应该被评为在最近时代中针对任何全球性挑战的最为糟糕的所谓“解决途径 ” 。	But using bio-fuels to combat climate change must rate as one of the poorest global “solutions” to any great challenge in recent times.
另一条路 — — 俾斯麦所采取的权力政治 — — 则是“微不足道 ” （ petty ） ， 其前提是欧洲分裂和瓦解。	The alternative – the power politics in which Bismarck was engaged – was “petty,” as it was premised upon European fragmentation and disintegration.
这在大部分欧洲国家都不可行，特别是在德国。 德国的贷款/房价比限制相当保守，再融资成本很高，并且大部分银行会拒绝任何试图通过将“房屋权益”套现筹钱度假或买新车的行为。	This is not possible in most of Europe, and especially not in Germany, where loan-to-value limits remain conservative, refinancing is costly, and most banks would frown on any attempt to cash in on “home equity” to finance a vacation or a new car.
即使您所做的一切都是从另一个慈善机构 — — 其背后也有另一个同样富有冲劲且同样充满激情的筹款者 — — 把钱挪过来，您可能依然会感到既踌躇满志又造福人类。	You would probably feel both motivated and good, even if all you had done was divert money from another charity about which another equally motivated fundraiser was equally passionate.
如果说谁投什么票是清楚的，那公众就会越来越多地要求讨论委员会的人选：既然货币政策委员会是事实上的货币当局，它为什么不能由选举产生呢？	If it is clear who will vote for which measure, there will be increased demand for a public debate about who should be chosen: why not elect the MPC, since it is effectively a monetary government?
无论梅能在6月份的选举中得到何种授权，一旦她签下一笔不利的脱欧交易，或者最终啥交易都没达成，那么她和她的政府 — — 更不用说整个英国经济 — — 都将举步维艰。	Regardless of the electoral mandate May secures in June, if she concludes a bad Brexit deal, or ends up with no deal at all, she and her government – not to mention the entire British economy – will be in for a very rough ride.
去年英国罗森若克（Northern Rock）银行的倒闭将会在很长时间内作为一个不要怎样管理这种风险的例子。	Last year’s Northern Rock debacle in the United Kingdom will long remain an example of how not to manage such risk.
执政六个月后，特朗普还没有一项立法成就值得宣扬（尽管他宣称参议院批准尼尔·哥萨奇（Neil Gorsuch）为新的最高法院法官是一场胜利 ） 。	At the end of six months in office, Trump doesn’t have a single legislative achievement to crow about (though he has claimed the Senate’s approval of Neil Gorsuch as a new Supreme Court justice as a victory).
如果当前趋势继续，到2030年 — — 即实现17个联合国可持续发展目标的时限 — — 英联邦国家70%以上的儿童的阅读和数学水平将存在缺失。	If current trends continue, by the year 2030 – the deadline for meeting the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals – more than 70% of children in Commonwealth countries will be failing reading and math.
新的货币战争动荡的根源很明确：在公共和私人部门从高债务状态去杠杆化的环境中，货币政策已成为唯一可行的刺激需求和增长的工具。	The cause of the latest currency turmoil is clear: In an environment of private and public deleveraging from high debts, monetary policy has become the only available tool to boost demand and growth.
当欧洲的公司将劳动密集型的制造业务外包到成本低的国家，但是将其他的生产过程留在欧洲的时候，对任何试图评价贸易保护措施的经济学的人来说，情况就变得非常复杂了。	When European corporations outsource labor-intensive manufacturing to low-cost countries but keep the rest of the production process in Europe, they greatly complicate matters for anyone trying to evaluate the economics of trade defense.
但他是资深公务员，也似乎是唯一一个能可信地保持心存不满的香港公职人员团结的技术官僚。 中国明白，公务员是治理香港不可或缺的要素，尽管香港公务员制度继承了英国。	But he was a senior civil servant, and seemed to be the only technocrat who could credibly hold together Hong Kong’s disaffected civil service, which China knew was indispensable to governing the territory, regardless of its British heritage.
但是，我却认识到一个残酷的事实，即俄罗斯正面对着截然相反的问题：人口的剧减已经威胁到俄罗斯人生活的每一个层面。	It was a grim recognition that Russia faces the opposite problem: a rapid decline in population that threatens every aspect of Russian life.
但是，即使主要外部市场不发生危机，像中国这样的又庞大又复杂的中等收入经济体期望获得６—７％以上的增长率也是不现实的。	Even without the crisis in major external markets, however, a large and complex middle-income economy like China’s could not realistically expect growth rates above 6-7%.
此外，只要国际社会不采取行动终止以色列侵占约旦河西岸并对加沙实施包围封锁，巴勒斯坦人就不会认为联合国承认其国家地位能改变他们的日常生活。	Moreover, Palestinians are not convinced that UN recognition will change their daily lives as long as the international community takes no action to end the Israeli occupation on the West Bank and the siege and blockade of Gaza.
如今，供应商数量增加到了五家，印度制药公司Biological E在今年早些时候宣布将以每针1.19美元的价格提供该疫苗。	Now there are five suppliers, and Biological E, an Indian pharmaceutical company, announced earlier this year that it would offer the vaccine for just $1.19 per dose.
法塔赫中央委员会的成员已经开始指责阿巴斯在本次战争中支持以色列，想“坐在以色列的坦克上返回加沙 ” 。	Members of Fatah’s Central Committee are already accusing Abbas of supporting Israel in the fighting, of wanting to “return to Gaza on an Israeli tank.”
几乎所有与会代表都赞同一点，那就是新古典主义经济学的旧有范式已经失效，但在何种范式可以取而代之这一点上却未能达成共识。	Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken, but there was no agreement on what can replace it.
欧洲也是每天改变着我们地区面貌的数以千计的项目：翻新学校、修建道路，以及人们期待已久的高速互联网接入。	Europe is also those thousands of projects daily that have changed the face of our regions: the school refurbished, the road built, and the long-awaited arrival of high-speed Internet access.
原因很显然：政府希望获得时间为自由化做准备，以此限制价格通胀的初始幅度，从而避免工资-价格螺旋，遏制资本外逃。	The reason is clear: by taking time to set the stage for liberalization, governments hoped to limit the initial spike in price inflation, thereby avoiding a wage-price spiral and curbing capital flight.
萨达姆被推翻后，另两个小布什总统所谓的邪恶轴心的成员 — — 伊朗和朝鲜认定，没有核武器使它们成为美国政变刀俎上的鱼肉。	And when he was brought down, the other two members of US President George W. Bush’s so-called axis of evil, Iran and North Korea, concluded that not having nuclear arms made them vulnerable to American attempts at regime change.
欧元区国家通货膨胀率高低两级的差值已从 1999 年的 2 个百分点达到老 2009 年底的 5.9 ，几乎翻了 3 倍。	In 1999, the difference between the euro-zone countries with the lowest and highest inflation rate was two percentage points. By the end of 2009, the difference had almost tripled, to 5.9 percentage points.
在宾夕法尼亚州，一项于１９９８年进行的对一所以种族主义狱警而臭名昭著的监狱的调查出示了记录对犯人经常性的殴打和例行羞辱的录像带。	In Pennsylvania, a 1998 inquiry into a supermax prison notorious for racist guards revealed videotapes of routine beatings and elaborate rituals of humiliation.
这一次也是一样，尽管卡绍吉失踪，但共同利益和互相依赖几乎肯定会战胜用其他紧密盟友所期待的标准对待沙特的渴望。	This time, too, in the wake of Khashoggi’s disappearance, common interests and mutual dependence will almost certainly prevail over the desire to hold the Saudis to the standards expected of other close US allies.
同埃及“沉默的大多数”相契合的，是各种伊斯兰团体所代表的现实，在这些团体眼中，民主和公民权等等是西方舶来的空洞字眼。	Egypt’s silent majority also identifies with the authenticity represented by various Islamic groups, while principles of democracy and civil rights seem to them to be imported Western abstractions.
在那之前，我们曾有过1946-1949年，1937-1942年的股市暴跌，而最惨烈的一次是1929-1933年。	Before that, we had declines in 1946-1949, 1937-1942, and the biggest of them all in 1929-1933.
对于面临来自能够结合颠覆性内容和大平台的新来者的激烈竞争的企业来说，挑战尤其艰巨，甚至是致命的 — — 显著的例子包括亚马逊、Facebook、谷歌、奈飞和优步等。	The challenge has proven particularly severe, if not fatal, for those facing intense competition from entrants able to combine disruptive content and big platforms – the most notable examples being Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix, and Uber.
默克尔可能被推翻，由在难民问题上倾向更右者取而代之 — — 即德国的库尔茨，比如现任联邦卫生部长的CDU的延斯·斯潘（Jens Spahn ） 。	Merkel could be toppled and replaced by someone further to the right on the refugee issue – a German version of Kurz – such as the CDU’s Jens Spahn, who is currently serving as the federal health minister.
培根对利用自然原因的科学理解来“影响所有可能的事物 ” — —即现在所谓的创新 — — 的务实目标是科学对社会的最初的承诺，后来成为启蒙时代的核心。	Bacon’s pragmatic objective of using a scientific understanding of natural causes to “effect all things possible” – what is now called innovation – was science’s original promise to society, and formed the core of the Age of Enlightenment.
同时由于中国是在六个月内免受美国制裁影响的八个国家之一，所以将继续从伊朗购买石油（占其进口量近达11 ％ ） 。	And, because China is one of eight countries exempted for six months from American sanctions, it will continue to buy as much as 11% of its oil from Iran.
如今，中国正在尝试艰难的转型 — — 从不完全契约系统转向更成熟完善的产权体制与市场，哈特和霍尔斯特罗姆的理论贡献在真实世界中的重要性从未如此清晰。	At a time when China is attempting the difficult transition from a system of incomplete contracts to a strong property-rights regime, the real-world importance of these contributions could not be clearer.
它们需要投入大量时间和资金训练科技人员和工程师、成立真正独立且资金充裕的监管者，还要建设必要的技术基础设施。	They need to invest considerable time and money in training scientists and engineers, establishing genuinely independent, well-funded regulators, and putting in place the necessary technical infrastructure.
低投票率和主流政党的弱势给了欧洲理事会 — — 欧盟成员国的国家领导人们 — — 继续在没有硝烟的房间里讨价还价的条件。	The low turnout and weakening of mainstream parties gives the European Council – national leaders of the EU’s member states – a pretext to continue cutting deals in smoke-free rooms.
这意味着我们决定将贫困线画在哪里可能不但会影响世界银行的使命，也会影响联合国及世界全体国家的发展日程。	This means that our decision on where to draw the poverty line probably will influence not just the World Bank’s mission but also the development agenda of the UN and all countries around the world.
八年后，它终于令人信服地复原了 — — 这场复原是如此有说服力，以至于​上月​美联储备在十年来首次调高了本国基准利率。	Eight years later, it is finally making a convincing recovery – so convincing that last month the US Federal Reserve raised the country’s base interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
使用货币时，我们就有了与其他人共荣辱的潜在心理体验，从而发展出一种对方会尽心尽力与你并肩作战的信任感。	In using it, one has the psychological experience of participating with others in a common venture, and thus developing a sense of trust in both the endeavor and one’s fellow-participants.
峰会东道主设定了相当宏大的目标，这反映在峰会主题中 ： “ 金砖国家和非洲 — — 面向发展、融合和工业化的合作伙伴关系 ” 。	The summit’s hosts have set ambitious goals, reflected in the summit’s theme: “BRICS and Africa – a partnership for development, integration, and industrialization.”
如果以色列总理连反诽谤联盟（Anti-Defamation League）全国主管亚伯拉罕·福克斯曼（Abraham Foxman）的支持都无法获得，那么说明他有麻烦了。	If an Israeli prime minister cannot even count on the backing of a man like Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, he is in trouble.
但即使在如何投票比达吉斯坦更自由的地方 — — 如卡尔梅克、布良斯克、克拉斯诺达尔、库尔斯克和其他工业和农业区 — — 也有大约80%的人支持普京。	But even in places where the voting was freer than in Dagestan – such as Kalmykia, Bryansk, Krasnodar, Kursk, and other industrial and agricultural regions – around 80% supported Putin.
这两种说法都不无道理，但都有些夸张，与此类似的还有美国决定和捍卫安全、繁荣的国际制度的能力正在衰退的观点。	While there is a kernel of truth in both narratives, each is a gross exaggeration, as is the notion that America’s capacity to shape a secure and prosperous international system is in decline.
毕竟他在2008年8月格鲁吉亚战争后就曾一度中止了入世谈判，但在今年春天，却也最终重新回到了谈判桌前。	After all, he suspended Russia’s WTO accession talks after the August 2008 war in Georgia, only to allow them to restart this spring.
这种专业知识的缺乏可能威胁几项可持续发展目标的实现，例如粮食安全、医疗卫生、清洁饮水、卫生设备以及能源和基础设施。	This dearth of expertise threatens a number of Sustainable Development Goals, such as food security, health care, clean water and sanitation, energy, and infrastructure.
因此该数据可分为两种类型：一种为含有能被机器识读的逻辑序列“含义”的程序；以及提供支持程序运作内容的纯数据。	So the data could be split into two types: a program that embedded the “meaning” of the logical sequence recognized by the machine, and the pure data that provided the context for the program to run.
据总部设在美国的国际政策中心的萨利·赫布克和艾利·里克曼反映，到2035年非洲就业市场的年轻人将超过世界其他国家的总和，而到2050年，每四个人里就将有一个在非洲生活。	According to Salih Booker and Ari Rickman of the US-based Center for International Policy, by 2035 Africa will have more young people in the job market than the rest of the world combined, and by 2050, one in every four humans will be African.
我们西方可能急需俄罗斯的能源，但如果俄罗斯不想在未来蜕变为东方式的专制，它就必须满怀诚意与西方接触。	We in the West may badly need Russia’s energy, but if Russia does not want its future to degenerate into Oriental despotism, it must engage with the West in good faith.
但仍有许多人之所以这样做是因为，政府并没有让市场在经济中起到更多的“决定性作用 ” ， 反而在加大政府控制。	But many others may be doing so for fear that, far from giving the markets a more “decisive role” in the economy, the government may be moving to assert greater control.
"比如20世纪80年代的葡萄牙就采用了削弱总统权力而扩大议会权力的半总统制，以至于把这种体制称为""议会半总统制""似乎更为妥当。"	"Like Portugal in the 1980's, they adopted semi-presidential systems that so reduce presidential authority and increase the parliament's powers that they are most accurately described as ""parliamentarized semi-presidential"" systems."
事实上，在放眼欧洲 — — 法国、希腊、爱尔兰、葡萄牙、西班牙还有英国莫不如此 — — 政府都因为发生了无力解决的危机而该换了门庭。	Indeed, throughout Europe – in France, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom – governments have been turned out of office in the face of a crisis that they have seemed unable to address.
戈尔和其他人经常争辩说如果气候变化研究能证明二氧化碳排放是有害的，那么人们就该停止排放 — — 而人们是有道义责任去这样做的。	Gore and others often argue that if the science of climate change concludes that CO2 emissions are harmful, it follows that we should stop those harmful emissions – and that we are morally obliged to do so.
1814年，英国人能够火烧白宫（以及华盛顿的大部分官方建筑）的原因正在于美国政客几乎完全破坏了中央政府的财政能力。	In 1814, the British were able to burn down the White House (and most other official buildings in Washington, DC) because American politicians had almost completely undermined the central government’s fiscal capacity.
相反，阿巴斯竭力要强化自身立场，在特朗普就任到他访问白宫这段时间里，他与埃及总统西西和约旦国王阿卜杜拉二世进行了五次会面。	On the contrary, Abbas has worked diligently to strengthen his own position, meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Jordanian King Abdullah II five times between Trump’s inauguration and the visit to the White House.
特朗普的税收方案是否能给他带来直接好处仍然是个问题，因为，与尼克松以来的所有其他总统候选人不同，他拒绝公布自己的所得税记录。	The question of whether Trump’s tax policies would benefit him directly remains unanswered, because, unlike all other presidential candidates since Richard Nixon, he has refused to release his income-tax records.
令人震惊的三百万叙利亚儿童目前处于流离失所状态，其中一百多万逃出了叙利亚，正在邻国（特别是黎巴嫩、约旦和土耳其）难民营中艰难度日。	A shocking three million Syrian children have now been displaced. More than one million of them have fled Syria and are languishing in camps in neighboring countries, particularly Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey.
此外，在20世纪，能源的消耗增加了16倍，导致每年1600万吨的二氧化硫排放到大气之中 — — 比自然排放量的2倍多。	Moreover, energy use has grown 16-fold during the twentieth century, causing 160 million tons of atmospheric sulfur-dioxide emissions per year – more than twice the total of natural emissions.
在经历了五年的增长放缓和失业上升后，其他债务国选民与意大利人（以及在其之前的法国人）可能会拒绝新的支出削减、税收增加和进一步的痛苦的贬值政策。	After five years of slow growth and rising unemployment, voters in other indebted countries, like Italians (and French voters before them), are likely to reject additional spending reductions, tax increases, and further painful deregulation.
上个月，国际刑警组织主席孟宏伟在从该组织总部巴黎前往北京途中消失。 中国是幕后之手，孟宏伟同时也是中国公安部副部长。	China was behind last month’s disappearance of Interpol President Meng Hongwei on a trip from France, where Interpol is based, to Beijing, where he also served as vice minister of public security.
该地区森林覆盖率已经下降70 % ， 而且山体侵蚀带来的沉积物已经堵塞了城市水库，从而对巴西最大城市的供水安全构成威胁。	The area has lost 70% of its original forest cover, and sediment from eroding hillsides has clogged the city’s reservoir, jeopardizing the water supply of Brazil’s largest city.
特朗普像俄罗斯总统普京一样利用徒劳和愤怒、怀旧的渴望和民族主义，并在移民等弱势群体中方便地寻找替罪羊。	Like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump harnesses futility and anger, exploits nostalgic yearning and nationalism, and finds convenient scapegoats in vulnerable people such as immigrants.
当地政府指责国家没有拨给足够的资源，而住院的精神病人却仍然只能透过被禁锢的窗户眼巴巴看着外面的世界。	The government placed the blame on local authorities; the local authorities blamed the government for allocating inadequate resources; and inmates of the institutions still look out at the world through windows that are locked and barred.
而德国转向东欧的外国直接投资在1990年代只有4 % ， 在世纪之交才达到30 ％ ， 可见奥地利与东欧的整合程度更高。	In Germany, just 4% of FDI moved to Eastern Europe in the 1990s, reaching 30% at the turn of the century. As a result, Austria became much more integrated with Eastern Europe.
以色列极有可能听从美国的劝告，只有在所有外交手段全部用尽、各方同意实施的所有制裁都无法阻止伊朗拥有核武器的努力后才会考虑实施先发制人的打击。	Israel will most likely listen to America’s advice and consider a preemptive attack on Iran only after all diplomatic means have been exhausted, and after whatever sanctions are agreed upon fail to cut short Iran’s march toward possessing the bomb.
只要法塔赫或多或少掌握约旦河西岸的局面，哈马斯所能做的充其量无非是不定期地向以色列境内射几枚火箭，或是偶尔引爆几辆公交车，而以色列可以在现状中逍遥存活。	As long as Fatah keeps things more or less under control on the West Bank, and all Hamas can do is periodically lob missiles across the Israeli border or occasionally blow up a bus, Israel can easily live with the status quo.
布鲁塞尔—2008年大爆发的全球金融危机对欧洲和美国的影响是非常相似的 — — 至少在一开始是如此。	BRUSSELS – The global financial crisis that erupted in full force in 2008 affected Europe and the United States in a very similar way – at least at the start.
Urlanis的观点是 — — 比起女人，男人才是更为敏感的生物 — — 这个观点在当今家庭生活质量恶化、一半婚姻以离婚收场、没有父亲的孩子数量不断上升至历史最高纪录的情况下，甚至更为贴切。	Urlanis’s argument – that men, not women, are the more delicate creatures – is even more relevant now, with family life decaying, half of marriages ending in divorce, and the number of fatherless children rising to record levels.
美元的剧烈升值确实会给企业和政府存在大量美元计价债务、货币贬值有可能失控的新兴经济体带来 严重问题。	A significant strengthening of the dollar would indeed cause serious problems for emerging economies where businesses and governments have taken on large dollar-denominated debts and currency devaluation threatens to spin out of control.
腐败和管理不善，加上结构性和外部挑战 — — 如油价下跌、水短缺和老龄化的失业人口 — — 让经济增长十分萎靡。	Corruption and mismanagement, along with structural and external challenges – such as falling oil prices, water shortages, and an aging unemployed population – had already weakened economic growth.
此外，多哈谈判还建立了一个单一谈判平台，并为新协定的出台划定了2015年的期限 — — 这是一个比大部分评论者和政府所认识到的重要得多的成就。	Moreover, a single negotiation platform has been established, and a 2015 deadline for concluding a new agreement has been set – a much more significant accomplishment than most commentators or governments have recognized.
今年夏天，在赫尔辛基的双边峰会中，特朗普甚至与前克格勃特工普京站在一边，而反对美国安全官员对于目前铁证如山的俄罗斯干涉2016年美国总统竞选问题的立场。	This summer, during their bilateral summit in Helsinki, Trump even sided with Putin, a former KGB operative, over US security officials on the issue of Russia’s now-documented interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
如果改革失去人心，或暴露出领导层的危险分歧，中国政府很有可能将会通过对外战争转移公众对国内矛盾的注意力。	If reforms become broadly unpopular or expose dangerous divisions within the leadership, the government will have good reason to divert public attention from controversies at home by picking fights abroad.
经济学家在许多事情上都存在分歧，但可以形成一致的一点是向得自哥斯达黎加土地的收入或资本利得征税不会让土地逃掉。	While economists differ on many matters, one thing they can agree on is that taxing the revenues or capital gains derived from Costa Rica’s land won’t cause the land to move away.
在拉丁美洲，阿根廷和墨西哥两国都在控制腐败和保持透明度的国家名单中排名垫底 — — 它们的排名比巴西要低得多。	In Latin America, Argentina and Mexico both rank among the bottom half of countries in controlling corruption and maintaining transparency – much lower than Brazil.
尤其是他们正在讨论所谓直升机撒钱的各种变体，沿袭米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）于1969年提出的著名思想实验 — — “有天一架直升机 . . . . . . 从天上撒下了本不存在的，总面值为1000美元的纸币 。 ”	In particular, they are debating variations of so-called helicopter money, following a famous thought experiment by Milton Friedman in 1969, in which “one day a helicopter…drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky.”
事实上，经济改革为个人创造力和企业家精神营造了空间，带来了前所未有的快速增长时期，将数亿中国人民带出贫困。	Indeed, by creating space for individual creativity and entrepreneurship, they unleashed a historically unprecedented period of rapid growth that lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty.
这比美国稳健得多 — — 美国去年人工作人口人均产出只增加了0.37 % ； 也比德国坚挺得多 — — 德国的数字是下降0.25 % 。	That is considerably more robust than in the United States, where output per worker grew by just 0.37% last year, and much stronger than in Germany, where it shrank by 0.25%.
那个戴着闪闪发光的无框眼镜的熟悉身影在看似有网球场大小的办公室里接见了我，他粗硬的头发像玻璃纤维般地被梳到脑后。	The familiar figure with the glinting, rimless glasses and the rigid hair forced back, as if it were spun glass, greeted me at the door of his seemingly tennis court-size office.
这些共有的价值观是将各国政府团结起来的粘合剂。 在此情况下，各国政府都承认当共同的关注需要我们采取共同战略时，敝帚自珍就不合时宜了。	These shared values are the glue that binds governments together in the recognition that clinging to pure self-interest is no longer reasonable when common concerns call for a common strategy.
但是，许多人对我说，这部分是政府有意压制的结果（另一个令人放心的事实是总体而言消费者并未过度负债 ） 。	But, as many pointed out to me, this is partly the result of deliberate government measures to deflate it (also comforting is the fact that consumers are in general not overleveraged).
其理念就是想要使金融系统不至于去安全拆解其一手打造的复杂得难以置信的合同网络 — — 而且不得出现系统崩溃的可能性。	The idea was to save the financial system from having to deal with safely dismantling the impossibly complex contractual edifices – which did not allow for the possibility of systemic collapse – that it had constructed.
以法国为例，其国民在医疗保健上的支出不到GDP的12 ％ ， 相比之下支出17％的美国人平均寿命却比前者整整少三年。	France, for example, spends less than 12% of its GDP on medical care, compared to 17% in the US. Yet Americans can expect to live three full years less than the French.
但只有在认识到他们的根本缺陷后，这些弱点才能得到改进。 这是一项比在每个单独国家进行结构改革更为重要的任务。	These can be changed, but only if their fundamental weaknesses are recognized – a task that is far more important than structural reforms within the individual countries.
除此之外，软件能帮助那些对人际关系一知半解的的人去改善自己 — — 或者至少更加意识到当自己亲近一个朋���或者疏远另一个时所付出的代价。	Still, it may help the semi-self-aware to improve their personal relations – or at least to be more aware of the trade-offs they make when they favor one friend or colleague over another.
60年代、70年代和80年代，大规模民权斗争磨刀霍霍向种族歧视和种族隔离，此后则是主张残疾人和性小众（sexual minorities）权利的斗争。	In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, great civil-rights battles were waged against racial discrimination and apartheid, followed by struggles to advance the rights of the disabled and sexual minorities.
希望在于，随着技术的发展，更多研究者能够认识到把结果返回给参与者的重要性 — — 特别是那些可能具有重大医学效果的结果。	The hope is that, as technology develops, more researchers will recognize the importance of returning results – especially those that could have a significant medical impact – to participants.
回避这一问题可能是为避免讨论这是否是一种变相大赦的谈判战术而已。 而不幸的是，在某种程度上这的确是一种变相的大赦。	The latter status may or may not include a path to residency and citizenship; fudging the issue may be a negotiating tactic to avoid debate over whether this is a form of disguised amnesty (which, fortunately, to a certain extent, it is).
这或者有些自私自利，但却并不令人意外；事实上，因为全欧洲企业都在其他地方寻找市场，英国的做法很可能带动其他地方取得类似的进步。	This may be self-serving, but it should not be a surprise; in fact, with businesses throughout Europe seeking markets elsewhere, Britain’s approach may well herald similar developments elsewhere.
事实上，如果评论者获得多次“赞 ” ， 或者其对发行人的评论经这些企业随后的成功证明颇有价值，那么为什么不付给他们报酬呢？	Indeed, why not pay commenters who accumulate “likes” or whose comments on issuers turn out to be valuable in light of evidence of those enterprises’ subsequent success?
很多人的状况 — — 更不用说人类状况本身 — — 的改善或者恶化将取决于我们对这次机遇如何善加利用。	The condition of many humans – not to mention the human condition itself – will improve or worsen depending on how we use this opportunity.
但改良测量工具以侦测甲烷源的希望就在眼前，在加利福尼亚的低空飞机测试中 — — 目的是完善测量工具的卫星应用 — — 取得了成功。	But improved measurement tools for detecting sources of methane are on the horizon, and are being successfully tested in California on low-flying planes, with the goal of perfecting the tools for use on satellites.
但是，作为安卡拉政治游戏大师，埃尔多安将竭力掌控大局并坚持当前道路 — — 依靠国内政治极化甚至大胆地出击境外。	But, as the master of the political game in Ankara, he will try to shape the agenda, and remain on his current course, by relying on domestic polarization and, perhaps, daring foreign adventures.
19世纪中期加州黄金储藏的发现，以及50年后阿拉斯加、南非以及澳大利亚黄金储藏的发现，也导致了温和的通胀，而在19世纪70年代和19世纪80年代，这样的发现的缺乏却导致了温和的通缩。	The discovery of gold in California in the mid-nineteenth century, and in Alaska, South Africa, and Australia 50 years later, also produced mild inflation, while the absence of such new discoveries in the 1870’s and 1880’s led to mild deflation.
因为这两种公司的基本治理问题差别很大，所以，有利于股权分散公司投资者的安排，在股权受控的公司中可能无关紧要，甚至是适得其反，反之亦然。	Because the basic governance problems in the two types of firms are considerably different, arrangements that benefit investors in widely held firms might be irrelevant or even counterproductive in controlled firms, and vice versa.
对于遭遇严重结构性问题且长期增长乏力的意大利而言，加大2019年预算赤字目标的做法怎么说都算不上是明智的。	For Italy, which suffers from deep structural issues and chronically anemic growth, increasing the target for the 2019 budget deficit is imprudent, to say the least.
同时，我不是提倡新兴市场要将其当前持有的数万亿美元外汇储备（仅中国就拥有3.3万亿美元的官方储备）中的大部分换成黄金。	No, I am just proposing that emerging markets shift a significant share of the trillions of dollars in foreign-currency reserves that they now hold (China alone has official reserves of $3.3 trillion) into gold.
当前形式下，比以往任何时候更需要说服德国，没有它在恢复增长和纠正外部失衡方面所做出的贡献，欧元区将会面临长期衰退和注定崩溃的厄运。	Now more than ever, Germany must be persuaded that without its contribution in reviving growth and correcting external imbalances, the eurozone faces prolonged depression and certain collapse.
签署了国际公民权利和政治权利公约（International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights）的国家（包括所有欧盟成员国）都有法律义务捍卫它。	Countries that have ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which includes all European Union members, are bound to uphold it.
此外并未发现辐射水平和哺乳动物密度之间有任何联系；污染最严重地区的哺乳动物数量和污染最轻的地方相差不多。	Nor do the population data show any link between radiation levels and mammal densities; the number of mammals in the most contaminated parts of the zone is similar to that in the least contaminated parts.
但把某项挑战定义为全球性挑战并不意味着就一定要用一项野心勃勃，整齐划一而��全球通行的条约来作为解决方案。	But to describe a challenge as global is not to argue that the remedy is to be found only in an ambitious, formal, and universal treaty.
因此我们也毫不奇怪地看到，尽管在近年有所改善，但阿拉伯国家的平均文盲率却依然在30%左右徘徊，在某些国家内部甚至达到了50%或60 % 。	Not surprisingly, despite progress in recent decades, illiteracy remains at around 30% on average, and in some Arab countries reaches 50% and 60%.
世界野生动植物基金组织（WWF）和世界银行也共同推动合伙人们设立了一项信任基金，来永久性管理这些保护区。	The WWF/World Bank alliance also motivated partners to establish a trust fund to manage these protected areas in perpetuity.
真相是各种政党平台 — — 原本它们应该起到让选民知情、为组阁谈判打下基础的作用 — — 表现出现象力和新思维方面的惊人的缺乏。	The truth is that the various party platforms, meant to inform the electorate and provide a basis for coalition talks, reveal a shocking lack of imagination and paucity of new ideas.
但数据监视和采集计划缺乏透明度意味着一旦举报人泄漏信息，人人都可以由此推导出政策制定原因和方法的不同版本。	But the lack of transparency surrounding data surveillance and mining means that, when a whistleblower leaks information, everyone can subsequently use it to build their own version of how and why policy is made.
随着我对曼德拉了解越多，我就越想知道他是如何完成这个不可想象的任务，熬过了27年牢狱并最终成为非洲最大经济体的总统。	As I learned more about Mandela, I wondered how he had achieved the unimaginable, overcoming a 27-year ordeal to become the leader of Africa’s largest economy.
他们告诉我们，近来的金融危机“与迫在眉睫的生态崩溃比较，简直是小巫见大巫 ” ， 这可能预示着“大规模的生态系统的崩溃”即将来临。	They tell us that the recent financial crisis “pales in comparison to the looming ecological credit crunch,” which could presage “a large-scale ecosystem collapse.”
突破产生于1998年12月，允许私有生物技术公司合法利用综合基因库的议案得到了冰岛议会的批准。 这是世界首创的基因库，含有该国270，000人口的全部基因数据。	A breakthrough came in December 1998, when Iceland's parliament approved a bill giving a private biotechnology company legal access to a comprehensive genetic database - the first of its kind - for the country's entire population of 270,000.
此时需要其他穆斯林国家站出来挑战沙特瓦哈比教派和其他主要保守主义教派的现代理念，即麦加无可改变也无法避免地在穆斯林世界发挥核心作用。	It is up to the rest of the Muslim world to provide alternatives to the modern idea, championed by Saudi Wahhabis and other arch-conservatives, that Mecca is the inexorable and inevitable center of the Muslim world.
这种储蓄模式的不对称可能因此体现出一个简单的事实：限制贷款的经济体相对于较少限制贷款的经济体来说对贷款成本的下降更加不敏感。	This asymmetry in savings patterns might thus reflect the simple fact that credit-constrained economies are less sensitive to drops in the cost of borrowing relative to less constrained economies.
美国全球变化研究计划最新公布的气候变化报告草案指出，近几年来，一些类型的天气事件变得越来越常见、越来越猛烈。	As the United States Global Change Research Program’s recently released draft report on climate change points out, some kinds of weather events have become more common, and more intense, in recent years.
只有一种方法让人们的视线从这一羞辱性的窘境中移开：宣传自力更生和美帝国主义及其韩国走狗迫在眉睫的威胁，必须这样做，而且要提高到歇斯底里的程度。	There is only one way to divert attention from this humiliating predicament: propaganda about self-reliance and the imminent threat from US imperialists and their South Korean lackeys must be turned up to a hysterical pitch.
各国在评估经济刺激方案的规模时，都会在 本国 预算的成本和收益之间保持平衡，而这一收益是以本国的经济增幅和就业率增幅来计算的。	In assessing the size of the stimulus, countries will balance the cost to their own budgets with the benefits in terms of increased growth and employment for their own economies.
而银行一方面能拥有更多的可支配储蓄，另一方面具备更灵活的利率政策，因此也能更容易地评估风险价格并因此贷款给广大中小企业。	With more deposits at their disposure and a more flexible interest rate policy, banks would be able to price risks more easily and thus lend more to SMEs.
上个月，米克·贾格尔（Mick Jagger）用西班牙语告诉他的古巴粉丝 ， “ 时代终于正在变化 ” 。	Last month, Mick Jagger told his Cuban fans in Spanish that “finally the times are changing.”
"政治学家特德·格尔（Ted Gurr）提出的""政治计划""和自由之家组织每年一度的《世界自由》调查几乎囊括了对各个国家的政治权利评价。"	Two initiatives - the Polity Project, founded by political scientist Ted Gurr, and Freedom House's annual Freedom in the World surveys - gauge political rights in almost every country.
比如说如果政府实施了一个伤害到这些企业最终盈利状况的规定，那么无论这个规定多么令人满意，或者无论企业会在规定缺失的情况下会造成多大危害，它们都会得到补偿。	They are compensated, for example, should the government adopt a regulation that hurts their bottom line, no matter how desirable the regulation or how great the harm caused by the corporation in its absence.
不幸的是，到目前为止，危机国家 — — 以法国为首 — — 还没有任何迹象表明做好了咬紧牙关的准备。	Unfortunately, thus far, there is no sign that the crisis countries, above all France, are ready to bite the bullet.
如果国有企业不想重蹈恐龙的覆辙，就不但要学习配合外国合作伙伴的舞步，也要学会霹雳舞、摔跤、站起来和其他新动作。	If SOEs are not to go the way of the dinosaurs, they will need to learn not only to waltz with foreign partners, but also to breakdance, fall, get up, and try out new moves.
此外，1914年的德国给英国造成了极大压力（并在工业优势方面超越了英国 ） ， 而如今美国在总体军事、经济和软实力资源方面仍领先中国数十年。	Moreover, whereas Germany in 1914 was pressing hard on Britain’s heels (and had surpassed it in terms of industrial strength), the US remains decades ahead of China in overall military, economic, and soft-power resources.
但在结束也门战争 — — 相较叙利亚战争，也门战争处于较早阶段，并且牵涉到的国际和地区利益也较少 — — 方面是有可能取得进展的，特别是如果考虑到沙特阿拉伯经济困难的话。	But progress toward ending the war in Yemen – which is at an earlier stage than the Syrian war, and entails fewer international and regional interests – is possible, especially given Saudi Arabia’s economic travails.
如果你长寿的可能性不太高，就可以买更多的人寿保险，甚至提前退休，以便有足够的时间做自己一直想做的事。	If your chances of a long lifespan are not good, you might buy more life insurance, or even retire early to have enough time to do what you always wanted to do.
事实上，今年GDP增长几乎肯定无法达到当局7%的目标，目前，全世界都在密切关注危机和急剧减速的信号。	Indeed, with GDP growth this year almost certain not to reach the authorities’ 7% target, the world is now watching closely for signs of crisis and a much sharper slowdown.
目前，共享3D打印服务正在日益增加，使你能够打印你自己设计或从3D设计商店在线分类和订单中找到的（定制版）设计。	Already, there is a growing number of shared 3D printing services, enabling you to print something of your own design or use (a customized version of) designs that you can find in online catalogues or order through 3D design shops.
发自纽约 — — 在经历了数十年波澜壮阔的增长后，中国经济的增速开始下降，而这也令其政府日渐处于资本账户自由化的诱惑之下。	NEW YORK – As China’s economy starts to slow, following decades of spectacular growth, the government will increasingly be exposed to the siren song of capital-account liberalization.
海地近年来的经济从20世纪80年代中期开始经历了悲剧性的显著下滑，美国出于好意但基本上后果可怖的外交政策有时候还要雪上加霜。	Haiti’s recent economic history is marked by a remarkable and tragic downslide since the mid-1980’s, exacerbated by sometimes well-intentioned but typically disastrously executed US diplomacy.
光是在去年，美国公司就实施了6,000多亿美元的股票回购 — — 不管用何种指标衡量都是令人惊讶的数字，也是历史之最。	Last year alone, US companies authorized more than $600 billion of share buybacks – an impressive amount by any measure, and a record high.
因为女性生殖器血吸虫病和淋巴丝虫病等疾病留下疤痕或遭到毁容的女性往往受到歧视，以至于她们无法结婚或者被配偶所抛弃。	Women who have been scarred or disfigured from diseases such as FGS and lymphatic filariasis are often stigmatized to the point that they are unable to marry or are abandoned by their spouses.
但其实世界上有足够的土地支持这种规模的可再生能源扩张，只要我们采取快速行动，就有足够的时间进行必要的投资。	But there is plenty enough land in the world to support renewable expansion on that scale, and enough time to make the necessary investments as long as we act fast.
在大众传媒转瞬即到的时代，全球公众能看到数不清的在线新闻、智能手机视频和Twitter流言，并根据这些内容作出评判。	In a world of instant mass communications, countries are judged by a global public fed on a diet of relentless online news, smartphone videos, and Twitter gossip.
许多国有企业和主权财富基金最近都成了风险资本，目标对准了产生能够支持它们的核心业务的创新的高科技公司。	Many SOEs and SWFs have recently established venture capital arms to target high-tech companies producing innovation that can underpin their core businesses.
即使是毛泽东本人及其在中国文化大革命时期释放的狂潮也不能使“四旧 ” （ 旧风俗、旧文化、旧习惯、旧思想）完全消失。	Not even Mao Zedong, with the fury unleashed during China’s Cultural Revolution, could make the “Four Olds” (old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas) vanish.
此外，由于煤电和天然气电电厂动辄持续50年或以上，这些投资要么将导致排放量达不到气候目标要求，要么导致重大资产减记。	And, because coal- and gas-fired power stations last 50 years or more, such investments raise the risk of either locking in emission levels incompatible with the climate target, or forcing major asset write-offs.
跨太平洋贸易合作伙伴关系（Transpacific Trade Partnership，TPP）支持者认为，它们应该把目光转向高速增长的亚洲。 TPP是一项正在讨论中的贸易协定，包括12个环太平洋国家。	They should look to fast-growing Asia, argue advocates of the Transpacific Trade Partnership (TPP), the proposed mega-regional trade accord that would bind together 12 Pacific Rim countries.
罗默的主要担忧似乎是一些经济学家有一种倾向，将对于特定理论的真理称为对于一切理论的真理，因此适合真实世界。	Romer seems to be worried principally about some economists’ tendency to claim that what is true about certain types of theories is true of all theories and thus applicable to the real world.
1989年中共镇压民主运动后，美国又帮助中国成为世界出口冠军，中国因此积累了巨额贸易盈余，也成为美国资本流入的主要来源。	And it was after the Communists crushed the pro-democracy movement in 1989 that the US helped to turn China into an export juggernaut that has accumulated massive trade surpluses and become the principal source of capital flows to the US.
麻省理工学院的安德鲁·迈克菲指出，从历史上看，技术革命“最终创造出更多、但有可能不同的工作机会 ” ， 但随着机器越来越聪明 ， “ 这次带来的结果可能存在差异 。 ”	As MIT’s Andrew McAfee pointed out, historically, technological revolutions have “eventually led to more, if different, jobs”; but, with machines becoming increasingly intelligent, “this time may be different.”
“世界工厂”供应链起步很低，一开始均位于沿海地区和经济特区，如今已遍布中国，生产从动物填充标本到iPad的一切东西。	Starting modestly in coastal areas and special economic zones, the “world factory” supply chain has spread throughout China, producing everything from stuffed animals to iPads.
因为伊朗的政治结构过于脆弱，这个伊斯兰共和国不可能像中国那样侥幸成功，把国内的政治压迫、经济改革和对外开放混合在一起。	The Islamic Republic will not be able to get away with the Chinese option – to combine political suppression at home with economic reform and greater openness to the outside world – because its structures are too weak and brittle for this.
美联储各会员银行超出货币需求量的总储备额在1932年时为2.56亿美元，1933年为5.28亿美元，1934年上升到16亿美元，最后在1936年堆积到26亿 。 ”	Reserves of member banks at Fed were $256 million more than required in 1932; $528 million in 1933, $1.6 billion in 1934, $2.6 billion in 1936.”
当被问及为何要再次参选时他回答（这一回答对国家领导人来讲可谓独树一帜 ） ， 西班牙前王后索菲亚鼓励他“完成这项任务 ” 。	When asked why he will run again, he replied – in a peculiar confession for a nationalist leader – that former Queen Sofía of Spain had encouraged him to “finish the job.”
这些乐观派的幻想受到了供给派的挑战。 供给派认为应该对中国低迷的国有部门采取休克疗法，并立即将中国尚不发达的资本市场融入如今动荡不已的全球金融体系。	The optimists’ unreality is rivaled by that of supply-siders, who would apply shock therapy to China’s slumping state sector and immediately integrate the country’s underdeveloped capital markets into today’s turbulent global financial system.
此外，一旦误判根深蒂固地竖立起来，要想纠正就变得极其困难 — — 特别是在问题的主题并不在专家专业知识范围内的时候。	Moreover, it is extremely difficult to correct misperceptions once they ossify – particularly if the topic in question is outside a pundit’s range of expertise.
事实上，没有它们，去年的中美减少碳排协议等协议 — — 更不用说“我们需要商业 ” （ We Mean Business）等动员商界的计划了 — — 就不可能发生。	Indeed, agreements like last year’s deal between China and the United States to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions – not to mention initiatives to mobilize business, such as We Mean Business – are unlikely to happen without them.
我们或许可以猜测未来几十年全球变暖的总体后果，但仍然难以预测遥远的未来会发生什���以及具体的细节。	We might guess the general consequences of global warming in the next couple of decades, but the details remain hard to predict, as does the distant future.
普林斯顿—最后，我们也许会幸运地看到，一小撮发达国家人民 — — 四个美国人和一个西班牙人 — — 遏制了埃博拉。	PRINCETON – It may, in the end, turn out to be fortunate that a handful of people in developed countries – four in the United States and one in Spain – have contracted Ebola.
正如荷兰的格特·维尔德斯（Geert Wilders）和法国的玛琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）等右翼民粹主义反体制分子近乎狂热的竞选运动所展现的那样，民众的反欧盟情绪比以往任何时候都更为广泛。	Anti-EU sentiment is more widespread than ever, as demonstrated by the feverish campaigns of right-wing populist insurgents like Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Marine Le Pen in France.
数百年来，财阀民粹主义已经用同一本剧本将多个民主国家变成了专制国家，也没有理由说明这场大戏会停止下来。	Pluto-populists have been turning democracies into autocracies with the same playbook for thousands of years. There’s no reason to think they would stop now.
第三，与西方的普遍看法不同，王岐山 — — 中国最精明、最有经验的高级官员之一 — — 在政治局常委中担任纪委书记一职并非沦为陪衬。	Third, and contrary to prevailing wisdom in the West, Wang Qishan, one of China’s savviest and most experienced senior officials, has not been relegated to obscurity in his new position overseeing “discipline” on the Standing Committee.
实施具体扶贫措施可以收到一箭双雕之效：通过减少人们的苦难进而刺激增长，最终为更多的具体扶贫措施赢得政治空间。	A direct attack on poverty can yield a double dividend: in reducing human misery, it could spark growth, thereby creating more political space for direct poverty reduction.
这起搬起石头砸自己脚的危机如今已经落幕，但美巴双方是否又能防止本已复杂且相互依赖的关系不再继续恶化。	This self-defeating crisis is now over, but can both sides really prevent further deterioration in their complex, mutually dependent relationship?
但是，在埃及，妇女前景看起来颇为不妙，因为她们没能保住革命前的分配制度 — — 当时，她们可以获得64个议会席位。	In Egypt, though, the prospects for women seem gloomier, because they failed to retain the pre-revolution quota system that had given them 64 parliamentary seats.
事实上，在率先爆发阿拉伯之春的三个国家中，利比亚已成为失败之国，埃及恢复了极权统治，而突尼斯正在因为恐怖袭击而出现经济和政治动荡。	Indeed, of the three initial Arab Spring countries, Libya has become a failed state, Egypt has returned to authoritarian rule, and Tunisia is being economically and politically destabilized by terrorist attacks.
它们带来的好处是增加了经济学家艾马尔·拜德（Amar Bhidé）所谓的风险消费（venturesome consumption ） ： 需求拉动的企业家精神和创新。	They have the added benefit of generating what the economist Amar Bhidé calls venturesome consumption: demand-led entrepreneurship and innovation.
"巴罗佐办公桌上堆积如山的文案都与里斯本备忘录有关，2000年，欧盟国家和政府领导人批准了一项雄心勃勃的计划，2010年前把欧盟建成""最有竞争力和活力的知识经济 "" 。"	"The thickest file on his desk concerns the Lisbon agenda, an ambitious programme approved in 2000 by the EU heads of state and government with the goal of making the Union ""the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy"" by 2010."
要让一个陷入如此深度危机的国家在从现在到2020年间满足采用欧元的条件 — — 两年内通货膨胀限制在欧元区平均水平2%之内并且汇率保持稳定 — — 是无法想象的。	It is inconceivable that a country in such deep distress could meet the conditions for euro adoption – inflation within 2% of the eurozone average and a stable exchange rate for two years – between now and the end of the decade.
老布什从四十多年前美国和联合国部队在朝鲜扩大战略目标并试图用武力统一半岛的事件中吸取了教训，顶住了进一步扩大战争目标的压力。	Fully aware of what happened some four decades earlier when the US and UN forces expanded their strategic objective in Korea and tried to unify the peninsula by force, Bush resisted pressures to expand the war’s aims.
这意味着挑战一个观念：全民共同永远比其他一切民主政治机制都重要。 这也意味着说服选民公投的任务是在具体的时间，解决一个具体环境中的具体的问题。	This means challenging the idea that a referendum permanently outweighs all other mechanisms of democratic politics and persuading voters that a referendum mandate refers to a specific question in specific conditions, at a specific time.
正是这一态度引起了国内批评者的愤怒，特别是左翼，他们指出，印度面临着巨大的社会和经济问题，承担不起沉迷于太空探索的奢侈。	This is precisely the attitude that raises the hackles of domestic critics, especially on the left, who argue that a country facing India’s crippling social and economic problems cannot afford the luxury of indulging in space exploration.
七年前关于气候变化经济学的《斯特恩报告 》 （ Stern Review）发布时，这个主题基本上还停留在理论阶段。	When the Stern Review on the economics of climate change was published seven years ago, the subject was largely theoretical.
这一比喻说法来自著名数学家兼计算机科学家阿兰·图灵（Alan Turing ） ， 他和John von Neumann以及其他理论家，发现了所有数学数字和逻辑之间的联系。	The metaphor comes from the famous mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, who, along with John von Neumann and other theoreticians, uncovered the link between the mathematics of whole numbers and logic.
直接的计算显示减排比执行照常的政策要好，就是说，利益的当前价值超过了代价的当前价值 — — 对于任何低于8.5%的社会时间偏好率而言。	A straightforward calculation shows that mitigation is better than business as usual – that is, the present value of the benefits exceeds the present value of the costs – for any social rate of time preference less than 8.5%.
虽然巴黎谈判人士不再要求零净排放，但这应当成为各国计划的目标，得到20国集团的批准，并最终体现在联合国协议当中。	While the net-zero objective was dropped by the negotiators in Paris, it should be endorsed by individual countries in their plans, reinforced by the G-20, and eventually enshrined in the UN agreement.
同样在人类的力量面前束手无策的还有我们饲养来吃的动物，其中，母猪的全部意义就是用来生产小猪 — — 四个一胎，每年两胎 — — 这一切都在只能勉强转身的狭窄空间内完成。	Equally subject to human power are the animals that we raise for food, among them sows confined for their entire pregnancies – four months per pregnancy, two pregnancies per year – in stalls too narrow for them even to turn around.
有时，国内政策会推动经济转型和减贫，就像中国大规模实现的那样，不但让本国经济受益，也让全世界消费者受益。	At other times, they will propel economic transformation and poverty reduction, as they have done on a massive scale in China, generating gains not just for the home economy but also for consumers worldwide.
他获得了决定性选举胜利，连续第三次出任总理，他的右翼利库德集团在以色列议会中获得比主要对手、中左翼的犹太复国主义联盟（Zionist Union）多五个的席位，这几乎让所有人大跌眼镜。	He surprised nearly everyone by securing a decisive electoral victory, winning a third consecutive term in office after his right-wing Likud party gained a five-seat advantage in the Knesset over its main rival, the center-left Zionist Union.
如果董事在无知之幕背后做出选择 — — 不知道他们在公司中的地位 — — 他们就会希望所有人都有机会实施变革或具有企业家精神。	If board members were making choices from behind the veil of ignorance –not knowing their position in the company – they would want everyone to have opportunities to implement change or be entrepreneurial.
由于证据不利于普��PSA测试，因此急需新的筛查测试和生物标记。 它们应能有效区别具有潜在生命危险的前列腺癌和危险性较小的前列腺癌。	As evidence tilts the balance away from widespread PSA testing, a new screening test or biomarker is urgently needed that can distinguish effectively between potentially life-threatening prostate cancers and less dangerous forms.
在奥地利，选民将在亲欧盟和反欧盟候选人之间选择，后者是与勒庞持有相同民族主义立场的奥地利自由党（FPÖ）的诺尔伯特·霍福尔（Norbert Hofer ） 。	In Austria, voters will choose between a pro- and an anti-EU candidate in the nationalist mold of Le Pen, Norbert Hofer of the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ).
普林斯顿 — — 唐纳德·特朗普总统解雇联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米的举动前所未有，特朗普担任总统后大部分所作所为也是一样。	PRINCETON – President Donald J. Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey is unprecedented, as is much of what Trump has undertaken as president.
9·11事件所遭致的反应以及斯特劳斯-卡恩在纽约饭店中与非洲女佣的过节之间毫无共通之处，但在一点上，它们有异曲同工之妙：在卡恩事件中，文化冲突再次起到了误导作用。	The response to 9/11 and to Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s recent encounter with an African chambermaid in a New York hotel have very little in common, except for one thing: once again, cultural conflict was invoked in a misleading way.
类似地，在印度的拉贾斯坦邦，由分散性妇女自助团地制作的高质量补充性食物正在改善6—36个月大的儿童的营养。	Similarly, in India’s Rajasthan state, high-quality complementary foods produced by decentralized women’s self-help groups are improving the nutrition of children aged 6-36 months.
事实上，印度教徒、基督教和佛教徒也被他们视为目标，并且宗教极端分子最近还袭击了被奉若神明的Sufi圣地，甚至还攻击了孟加拉国联合了各宗教以共同名义举行的文化活动。	Indeed, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists have been targeted as well, and religious extremists more recently have attacked Sufi shrines deemed to be idolatrous, and even Bengali cultural events that unite all religions in a common identity.
由此看来，在大萧条爆发后的11年中罗斯福和他的团队不但令美国的人均国民收入恢复到了之前的高点，还将每个工人的产出提高了11 ％ 。	So, within 11 years of the start of the Depression, Roosevelt and his team had gotten US per capita national income back to its previous peak while pushing output per worker 11% higher.
此外，危机爆发前的收入财富不平等现象依然存在（这与后大萧条时期不平等现象有所缓解形成了鲜明的对比 ） 。	Moreover, the pre-crisis trend of rising income and wealth inequality is continuing (in marked contrast to the post-Great Depression period, in which inequality declined).
马克龙正确地指出，不能再放任欧尔班的匈牙利和卡钦斯基的波兰从更富裕的欧洲伙伴手中拿钱，却视欧盟价值观为无物。	Macron is right to argue that Viktor Orbán’s Hungary and Jarosław Kaczynski’s Poland should no longer be allowed to pick the pockets of their richer European partners, while trampling over EU values.
在这方面，奥运一结束文在寅就会迎来一次严峻的考验，那时韩国和美国联合司令部将就未来美韩军演计划做出决策。	In that respect, Moon’s first big test will come immediately after the Olympics, when the South Korea-US Combined Forces Command will decide on its plans for future military exercises.
我在隐加林遇见的是以色列最美的一面 — — 也直接驳斥了那种认定以色列是个“种族隔离国家”的惯常指控。	What I encountered that day in Ein Kerem was the best of Israel – and a direct rebuttal to the frequent accusation that Israel is an “apartheid state.”
吉尔刚坐落着许多腾飞的科技企业，而在这次访问中，我拜访了一家印度领先的诊断公司 — — SRL诊断公司，它正在开发能够改善抗生素使用的工具。	Gurgaon is home to a lot of high-flying technology firms, and on this trip I visited one of India's leading diagnostics companies, SRL Diagnostic, which is developing tools that could improve the use of antibiotics.
由于海盗在公海实施犯罪，而公海不属于任何一个国家的领海，因此就产生了一种思想：他们是人类的公敌，任何国家头可以起诉他们。	Because pirates committed their crimes on the high seas, beyond the territory of any state, the idea developed that they were enemies of humanity whom any state could prosecute.
美国经济学家亚瑟·奥肯（Arthur Okun）著有经典名著《平等与效率：大权衡 》 （ Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff ） ， 他认为公共政策就是围绕管理这两种价值的冲突而生的。	The American economist Arthur Okun, whose classic work on the topic is called Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff, believed that public policies revolved around managing the tension between those two values.
为了应对飓风 — — 以及为灾后重建筹集一些资金 — — 所有人都把目光转向了政府，一如他们在2008年经济危机后所做的那样。	In responding to the hurricane – and in funding some of the repair – everyone turns to government, just as they did in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis.
印度一旦在那次战争中打败巴基斯坦，绝大多数难民都返回了新独立的孟加拉，但仍然有些人选择留在印度，留在那里的人与当地民众实现了无缝同化。	Once India had defeated Pakistan in that war, most of the refugees returned to the newly independent Bangladesh, though some remained in India, where they assimilated seamlessly.
我的公司、网络运营商兼互联网服务提供商英国电信的安全团队每天都能监测到100,000份恶意软件样本 — — 相当于每秒钟超过一次。	The security team of my company, BT, a network operator and Internet service provider, detects 100,000 malware samples every day – that’s more than one per second.
因此，全世界都会非常自然地认为，如果欧盟开始分裂，最初一定从危机深重的南欧（其中又以希腊首当其冲）开始。	So the entire world quite naturally assumed that any process of EU disintegration would start primarily in the crisis-ridden European south (Greece, first and foremost).
作为一个贸易盈余的储蓄者，中国自1994年以来就拥有大幅经常账户盈余，并逐渐积累到今天将近3.7万亿美元的巨额外汇储备。	As a surplus saver, China has run large current-account surpluses since 1994, accumulating a massive portfolio of foreign-exchange reserves that now stands at almost $3.7 trillion.
而日本对一位可以执掌政治方向盘的民选官员的需求也在1993年逐渐凸现，当时两位重要政治人物都脱离自民党另立门户。	The need for a political steering wheel in the hands of elected politicians was highlighted in 1993, when two major political figures bolted from the LDP with their followers.
对于人造细菌可能的利用领域来说 ， “ 辛西娅”的诞生必须和墨西哥湾这场世界最严重的漏油事故争夺新闻头条的事实比任何公关行动都更有说服力。	As for the likely usefulness of synthetic bacteria, the fact that Synthia’s birth had to compete for headlines with news of the world’s worst-ever oil spill made the point more effectively than any public-relations effort could have done.
1930年代的绥靖政策 — — 即放弃外交干预以及反对武力解决的做法 — — 当年都被用来说服人们：如果他们不保卫南越以及不入侵伊拉克的话，就会吞下什么样的苦果。 但而今我们也早已明白，自己被蒙骗了。	1930’s appeasement – a word that elides diplomatic engagement and the rejection of military options – was said to remind us of what would happen if South Vietnam was not defended and Iraq not invaded. We know what happened in both countries.
圣塔莫尼卡 — — 今年夏天席卷全球的创记录暑热是一种令人挥之不去的警示，它提醒人们，随着全球气温的升高，那些生活在社会边缘的民众 — — 包括病人、老人和穷人 — — 将会不成比例地忍受痛苦。	SANTA MONICA – The record-setting heat that blanketed the planet this summer was a sticky reminder that as global temperatures increase, people on the margins of society – the sick, the elderly, and the poor – will suffer disproportionately.
经济学家一直都提倡金融秩序的自由性，几乎异口同声地反对“政府的过度监管 ” ， 认为自由的金融可以促进社会的繁荣。	It was economists who legitimized and popularized the view that unfettered finance was a boon to society. They spoke with near unanimity when it came to the “dangers of government over-regulation.”
到1980年该一差距已经扩大到至少33 ％ ， 幅度达300 ％ ； 如今则是28％和360 ％ 。	By 1980, that spread had widened to at least 33% and as much as 300%; and today it is 28% and 360%, respectively.
在由一家西方机构组织的年度论文大赛中，以往所有的阿拉伯参赛者们都关注着以色列所声称的对全地区问题解决的责任。	All the Arab entries in an annual essay contest run by a Western agency used to focus on Israel’s alleged responsibility for all the region’s problems.
不幸的是，目前经济学的理论假设的前提是完美的价格，这让经济学家和政策制定者忽视了资产价格波动在系统中存在的风险。	Unfortunately, contemporary economic theory, with its presumption of perfect price discovery in asset markets, has discouraged economists and policymakers from paying any attention to the role of asset-price swings in managing systemic risk.
雇主们也有了招工和评估劳动者的新工具，让他们可以轻易替换那些低技能劳动者，因此可能在短期内让收入不均状况进一步恶化。	Now that employers have new tools for recruitment and assessment, they may find low-skilled workers easier to replace, potentially worsening income inequality in the short run.
与荷兰及波罗的海国家一道，德国将危机归咎于某些成员国的财政疏忽和在监控私人债务方面所表现出来的不足。 德国以此为由拒绝认真审视欧元区的系统性问题。	Along with the Netherlands and the Baltic states, Germany blames that crisis on some member states’ budgetary imprudence and insufficient monitoring of private debt, and thus refuses to examine properly the eurozone’s systemic problems.
英国绘制的欧洲改革蓝图应当敢作敢为、高瞻远瞩，充分认识到单一市场在社会层面的特点并深化科研领域的泛欧合作。	The British blueprint for a reformed Europe should be bold and far-sighted, recognizing the social dimension to the single market and deepening pan-European collaboration in scientific research.
除非马杜罗自己改变，否则新一届国民大会 — — 反对党所占三分之二的多数席位足以修订宪法 — — 必须用尽一切手段改变他。	Unless Maduro changes, the new National Assembly – where the opposition’s two-thirds majority enables it to amend the constitution – will have to change him.
如今，被迫移民所面临的情况与可持续发展目标（SDG）等国际承诺截然相悖，SDG要致力于“不抛弃任何一个人 ” 。	The conditions facing forced migrants today stand in stark contrast to international commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals, which strive to “leave no one behind.”
麻烦之处在于，在许多情形中，规则和监管总是倾向于确保金融市场的稳定性，而牺牲了退休基金和其他资金平滑有效地配置储蓄的能力。	The trouble is that in many cases, rules and regulations intended to ensure financial markets’ stability impede the ability of pension funds and others to allocate savings smoothly and efficiently.
但是欧洲国家的刻意疏远只不过进一步增强了许多俄国人的孤独感，促使他们在界定国家利益的时候不与欧洲国家相调和。	But keeping Russia at arm’s length from Europe has only strengthened the sense of isolation that many Russians feel, tempting them to define the country’s interests in ways that are irreconcilable with those of Europe.
在较为富裕的意大利北部地区，其个人均收入为3万欧元（折合4.5万美元 ） ， 接近德国的水平，人们正在怀疑欧盟成员资格的合理性。	In the country’s wealthier north, where average per capita income, at €30,000 ($40,500), approaches that of Germany, people are questioning the rationale of EU membership.
如今，生活在波哥大、蒙得维的亚、圣保罗或圣地亚哥市郊的中产阶级，他们的平均收入（美元值）仍远低于北美或欧洲。	Today, a middle-class family living on the outskirts of Bogotá, Montevideo, São Paulo, or Santiago has an average income that is much lower in dollar terms than that of its counterparts in North America or Europe.
如果被不幸言中，那么国家债务的巨额增长和即便7000亿美元也不足以挽救美国经济的认识将进一步侵蚀人们的信心，加剧经济的疲弱态势。	If so, the huge increase in the national debt and the realization that even $700 billion is not enough to rescue the US economy will erode confidence further and aggravate its weakness.
相反，美国似乎意在维持其现有模式 — — 认为在过去运行得十分完美的低储蓄、过度消费模式将在未来继续平稳运行。	Conversely, America seems intent on maintaining its current course – believing that the low-saving, excess-consumption model that worked so well in the past will continue to operate smoothly in the future.
我们还必须投入更多的资源 — — 包括从贫困学生奖学金到新的图书馆和教室设备 — — 来全方位地提升学校和学习状况。	We must also invest more in resources for schools and learning across the board, from scholarships for poor students to new libraries and classroom equipment.
首先，尽管许多人指出欧盟与其公民距离太远，但民调一直显示，对主要欧洲机构的公共信任度仍比国家机构高。	For starters, although much has been made of the argument that the EU is too far removed from its citizens, opinion polls have shown consistently that public trust in the major European institutions remains higher than trust in national institutions.
如果说有什么不同，将马克龙强行挤进传统法国政治样板的诸多尝试表明人们迫切需要对欧洲和全球政治进行重塑，以便能够解释新的论据、说法和裂痕。	If anything, the many attempts to squeeze Macron into a traditional French political archetype show that European and global politics desperately need to be reframed to account for new arguments, narratives, and fault lines.
事实上，哈佛大学政治学家亚沙·芒克（Yascha Mounk）的世界价值观调查数据分析表明，在许多西方国家，公众对民主的信心下降已经有相当长的时间了。	In fact, Harvard University political scientist Yascha Mounk’s analysis of World Values Survey data shows that, in many Western countries, public confidence in democracy has been declining for quite some time.
即使是把自己的权力建立在民粹反美主义基础上的委内瑞拉总统雨果·查韦斯也肯定正在祈祷美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马的一揽子经济刺激计划能够成功，从而抬高委内瑞拉下滑的石油收益。	Even Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez, who built his power on populist anti-Americanism, must be praying for the success of US President Barack Obama’s stimulus package to lift his falling oil revenues.
尽管7月18日巴基斯坦宪法修正案获得通过，从而使宪法恢复到1973年颁布时的形式，但掌握政治和行政大权的仍然是巴基斯坦总统阿西夫·阿里·扎尔达里。	Despite passage in July of the 18th amendment to the Pakistani constitution, which restored it to the form in which it was promulgated in 1973, political and executive authority remains in the hands of President Asif Ali Zardari.
当米洛舍维奇八年前被推翻时将暴力民族主义变为非暴力的民族主义塞尔维亚依靠普京在背后的撑腰，一直在尽力阻止在这些问题上作出决议。	Serbia, which traded violent nationalism for nonviolent nationalism when Slobodan Milosevic was overthrown eight years ago, has done all it can to impede resolution of these issues, with strong support from Vladimir Putin’s Russia.
结果就是大笔的重新入伍奖金、提高福利以及更高的招募成本。 仅仅从2003年到2005年这一费用就提高了20 ％ 。	The result is large re-enlistment bonuses, improved benefits, and higher recruiting costs – up 20% just from 2003 to 2005.
这就使得这些国家的津贴支出比退休年龄为60岁或以下的国家 — — 例如法国和希腊 — — 要低得多，而后者的退休金支出正在不断膨胀。	This keeps costs much lower than in France, and Greece, for example, where the retirement age is 60 or below, and where pension outlays are soaring as a result.
有可能（但可能性不大）泰德·科鲁兹（Ted Cruz）等强硬派或神经外科医生本·卡尔森（Ben Carson）等有着深刻宗教信念的十足的“打酱油”角色会成为共和党领袖。	It is unlikely, but possible, that a hardliner like Ted Cruz, or a rank amateur with deep religious convictions, such as the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, will capture the party.
保护责任思想在2005年联合国大会上获得一致通过，它认为，国际社会有义务实施干预以保护遭受本国政府大面积打击的平民。	This doctrine, adopted unanimously by the UN General Assembly in 2005, holds that the international community is obliged to intervene to protect a civilian population under massive attack by its own government.
事实上，尽管如今苏联入侵阿富汗所造成的灾难性后果已是众所周知，但在当时，入侵阿富汗被视为对西方的重大胜利。	Indeed, while the devastating consequences of the Soviet Union’s Afghan adventure are now well known, at the time the invasion was viewed as a major defeat for the West.
目前的监管规则允许银行只持有极薄的股本缓冲，充分利用纳税人的资助，金融企业的负债率远高于典型的大型非金融企业。	The status quo allows banks instead to leverage taxpayer assistance by holding razor-thin equity margins, relying on debt to a far greater extent than typical large non-financial firms do.
得益于波兰强劲的经济表现，其货币兹罗提（złoty）兑欧元基本保持平稳，2月初汇率仅较今年年初下跌了2.2 % 。	For example, thanks to Poland’s robust economic performance, the złoty has essentially maintained its exchange rate against the euro, slipping 2.2% since the start of the year (as of the beginning of February).
对癌症发病率以及事故发生后的几个月内在核反应堆工作的“清除人员”心血管疾病的上升的研究仍然在进行之中。	Studies are still under way into elevated rates of cancer and cardiovascular disease among the “liquidators” who worked at the reactor site in the months following the accident.
尽管希格斯波色子的发现有助于我们理解基本粒子质量（包括其本身）的来源，但大自然在两个更进一步的方面给了我们惊喜。	Although the Higgs discovery may help us to understand the source of elementary particles’ mass (including its own), nature has surprised us in two further respects.
利比亚没有象征性的宗教少数派，数十万埃及人在利比亚生活和工作，在这里，宣传基督教是非法的 — — 只要拥有圣经，就可能因传教而被告上法庭。	While Libya has no significant religious minority, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians live and work in the country, where Christian proselytizing is illegal – and where one can be accused of proselytizing simply for possessing a Bible.
这起地方性恐怖事件具有全国性意义，因为它证明已故美国外交官兼战略家乔治·凯南的警告是正确的，凯南警告美国外交决策者应该遏制自己的行为冲动，特别是在军事方面。	This act of local horror was also one of national significance, for it vindicated the late US diplomat and strategist George F. Kennan’s warning that American foreign policymakers should hold in check their urge to act, especially militarily.
但是，可能大家没有注意到，华尔街（或者更一般地说，整个金融界）对成功的奖赏正在发生变化，这亦是理所当然，正如金融的定义必须做出改变，如果金融界想赢回崇高的社会地位以及公民和领导人的信任的话。	But, however imperceptibly, the rewards for success on Wall Street, and in finance more generally, are changing, just as the definition of finance must change if is to reclaim its stature in society and the trust of citizens and leaders.
而美国也已明确表示，遏制行动不仅限于网络报复（尽管这是可能的 ） ， 还可能选择任何工具 — — 从公开指责羞辱到经济制裁，再到核武器 — — 来打击其他部门。	And the United States has made clear that deterrence is not limited to cyber retaliation (though that is possible), but can target other sectors with any tools it chooses, ranging from naming and shaming and economic sanctions to nuclear weapons.
而后，随着巴勒斯坦人占据上风，他们就可以进入第二阶段，也就是用武力征服以色列全境－开展针对平民的恐怖活动－这个过程还会持续很多年。	Then, with Palestinians gaining the upper hand, they can advance to a second stage in which all of Israel is conquered, implying armed struggle - which often takes the form of anti-civilian terrorism - for many more years.
因此就有个好消息，那就是美国经济和金融投资者在未来几年内都不大可能迎来大规模的通货膨胀或者通货紧缩。	So the good news is that the possibility of significant inflation or deflation during the next few years is low on the list of economic risks faced by the US economy and by financial investors.
另一个说法则指出国际货币基金组织是一个欧洲主导的机构，有一个欧洲人总裁，以欧洲人为主的员工队伍和欧式文化氛围。	Another is that the IMF is a predominantly European institution, with a European managing director, a heavily European staff, and a European culture.
现在，与其说需要在希腊和西班牙内部采取结构改革，不如说欧元区的设计需要结构改革，并且还需要反思导致这一货币联盟表现如此拙劣的政策框架。	What is needed is not structural reform within Greece and Spain so much as structural reform of the eurozone’s design and a fundamental rethinking of the policy frameworks that have resulted in the monetary union’s spectacularly bad performance.
该计划更出名的叫法是马歇尔计划，它包括美国大量出资援助支持欧洲的国家发展项目，迄今仍有许多欧洲人认为这是美国的光辉时刻。	The Marshall Plan, as it is better known, entailed a massive infusion of US aid to support national development efforts in Europe, and is still viewed by many Europeans as America’s finest hour.
鉴于瑞士在富足、教育程度高、创新能力强和适应性好等方面享有盛誉，它在指数中排名居前可能没有什么值得大惊小怪的。	Given Switzerland’s reputation for being wealthy, well educated, innovative, and resilient, its success in the index may not seem surprising.
此外，反美力量 — — 真主党、伊朗、俄罗斯和土耳其 — — 利用特朗普的离间性决定作为加强自身地区影响力、削弱美国及其盟友影响力的机会。	Moreover, anti-American powers – Hezbollah, Iran, Russia, and Turkey – have taken Trump’s divisive decision as an opportunity to enhance their own regional influence, at the expense of the US and its allies.
通过开发森林在大规模碳捕获和储存过程中所发挥的经济价值 ， “ 减少因森林砍伐和退化所造成的碳排放计划”可以让森林与导致森林砍伐的伐木或农业等利润丰厚的土地使用形式展开竞争。	By putting an economic value on forests for the role they play in large-scale carbon capture and storage, REDD+ allows standing trees to compete with lucrative land uses – such as logging or agriculture – that result in deforestation.
特朗普当选后不出几天 ， 《 纽约时报》就报道说“马里昂·勒庞，马琳·勒庞的侄女兼国民阵线的新兴力量，发Tweet说‘我答应了史蒂芬·巴农 … … 的合作邀请 ’ 。 ”	Within days of Trump’s election, the New York Times reported, “Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, Marine Le Pen’s niece and a rising force in the National Front, tweeted, ‘I answer yes to the invitation of Stephen Bannon… to work together.”
与此同时，政府研发预算在近几年中一直在下降 — — 部分是因为对国家在促进创新和增长中的角色认识不足，最近则是拜2008年金融危机以来的紧缩所赐。	Meanwhile, government R&D budgets have been declining in recent years – a trend driven partly by under-appreciation of the state’s role in fostering innovation and growth, and more recently by austerity in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
斯堪的那维亚的人均GDP比其他欧盟国家高出39 % ， 平均失业率为6.7 % ， 欧盟其他国家则为8 % 。	Its average per capita GDP was 39% above that of the other EU countries, and on average the unemployment rate stood at 6.7%, compared to 8% elsewhere in the old EU.
作为一个2017年度年产出达3250亿美元并拥有560万居民的国家，新加坡目前在经济上可以与丹麦比肩（尽管其​​人口更加多样化 ） 。	With annual output of approximately $325 billion in 2017 and 5.6 million inhabitants, Singapore now ranks with Denmark economically (though its population is more diverse).
特里谢的沟通技巧下降的迹象在去年九月就已经十分明显了。 当时治理委员会未能通过这位ECB总裁在上一个月所承诺的升息。	Indications that Trichet’s communicative skills were slipping already had become evident last September, when the Governing Council could not follow through with the rate increase the ECB president had promised the previous month.
网络领域的战略研究与20世纪50年代的核战略极为相似：分析师并不十分清楚进攻、防守、威慑、升级、规则和军控的涵义。	Strategic studies of the cyber domain resemble nuclear strategy in the 1950s: analysts are still not clear about the meaning of offense, defense, deterrence, escalation, norms, and arms control.
尽管产品商业化现成的机会很少，但全世界的企业、研究机构、大学及政府实验室合起来每年投入超过1万亿美元用于研发。	Despite few ready avenues for product commercialization, the world’s companies, research institutes, and university and government laboratories together spend more than a trillion dollars on R&D annually.
在欧洲之外，旅行最密集的国家为加拿大、以色列、新加坡和美国，这反映了一个事实：它们需要部署许多大脑来让它们多样化的知识派上用场。	Outside of Europe, the most travel-intensive countries are Canada, Israel, Singapore, and the United States, a reflection of the fact that they need to deploy many brains to make use of their diverse know-how.
伦敦—自沙特（Al Saud）家族1932年建立由家族名字命名的王国以来，沙特阿拉伯的权力便一直由波诡云谲的宫廷政治左右着。	LONDON – Ever since the Al Saud clan established in 1932 the kingdom to which they gave their name, the exercise of power in Saudi Arabia has been shaped by the intrigues and intricacies of royal politics.
如果还不能被称为僵局的话，至少NPT框架内和其他裁军领域内的磋商和会谈已经到了一个非常困难的阶段 ， 。	Deliberations and negotiations both within the NPT regime and in other areas of disarmament have reached a difficult stage, if not a stalemate.
阿尔巴尼亚正在投资修复本国那些历史悠久的城市，目前还针对100个具备强大农业旅游潜力但恰好位于贫穷原始地区的村庄投资。	Albania has invested in the recovery of its historic cities and is now investing in 100 villages with strong agro-tourism potential that happen to be in areas that are both poor and pristine.
官僚家族在上述领域一直保持着优势地位，这部分需要归功于税收体系妨碍了非营利性机构，特别是智库的产生，而独立的政策知识正需要通过以上渠道获得。	The mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard, owing partly to the tax system, which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions, especially think tanks, where independent policy expertise can be forged.
这些黑客（尤其是参与网络间谍活动、窃密活动或恐吓行动的黑客 ） ， 看起来不大可能是一些与中国政府没有关系的独立个人；更有可能的情况是：这些黑客与人民解放军之间有着关联。	It seems unlikely that these hackers, especially those engaged in cyber espionage, pilferage, and intimidation, are private individuals with no links to the Chinese government. It is more likely that they are tied to the People’s Liberation Army.
户主（主要是男性）因为有年收入低于12 000美元的从属（主要是女性）而获得的“特殊从属”免税在2004年被废除，但是“从属”的免税依然有效。	A “special dependent” exemption that could be claimed by heads of households (mainly men) for dependents (mainly women) who earned less than about $12,000 per year was eliminated in 2004, but a “dependent” exemption still remains.
按照特朗普的说法，这些新举措将在煤炭行业创造新的工作岗位，实现美国“能源独立 ” ， 并促进经济增长。	According to Trump, these new measures will create new jobs in the coal sector, achieve US “energy independence,” and boost economic growth.
在一些地区，关税和其他税收将药价提高了三分之二之多，即使是最基本的非专利药，对许多最贫困人群来说也是高不可及。	With tariffs and other taxes increasing drug costs by as much as two-thirds in some areas, even the most basic generic drugs become unaffordable for the poorest people.
尽管有某些非法要求获得补贴的案例正在受到调查，但是并没有出现非法买卖收据的现象；欺诈看上去主要来自伪造的收据。	While some cases of illegitimate claims are under investigation, there is no black market for receipts; fraud seems to arise mainly through falsified invoices.
喜怒无常的朝鲜政权在全世界最有权力的少年犯金正恩的领导下，不但拥有核武器，还在致力于研发远程输送能力。	That country’s volatile regime, led by the world’s most powerful juvenile delinquent, Kim Jong-un, not only possesses nuclear weapons, but is also working to develop long-range delivery capacity.
唯一的希望是出现一场促使立刻行动的国际运动，比如像在哥本哈根会议前那样迫使世界最大碳排放国 — — 包括美国和中国 — — 给出排放目标。	The only hope is an international movement for immediate action, such as that which, in advance of the Copenhagen conference, compelled the world’s largest carbon emitters – including the United States and China – to set emissions targets.
如果把已提交自愿减排承诺的160多个国家的贡献 — — 也就是所谓“预期国家确定贡献 ” — —加在一起，失败的规模就显而易见了。	When the contributions of the more than 160 countries that have submitted their voluntary mitigation commitments – the so-called “intended nationally determined contributions” – are added up, the scale of the failure becomes evident.
这项工作将有助于催生能为非洲提供廉价、可持续卫生服务的商业创新，该计划可以令两百万城市居民直接受益，并通过附属项目惠及另外600万人。	This effort will help to develop business innovations for affordable and sustainable sanitation services in Africa, which could reach two million urban dwellers directly and another six million people through subsidiary projects.
在这样一个系统中，个人交通成本将比拥有和操作一辆汽车节约最多80 % ， 由此带来的事件效率提高进一步增加了成本节约。	Under such a system, personal mobility could cost up to 80% less than owning and operating a car, with time efficiencies augmenting those savings further.
在3月4日举行的议会选举中，叛乱的五星运动（M5S）以惊人的33%得票率胜出，而民主党人仅为19 % ， 联盟党人为17 % 。	The insurgent M5S finished first in the March 4 parliamentary vote with an astounding 33% of the vote, compared to 19% for the Democrats and 17% for the League.
适用保护责任的行动在开始时仅限于警告、威胁制裁和在国际刑庭提出起诉，后来才开始允许军队为民众提供保护。	Invoking RtoP, that response began with a warning and the threat of sanctions and prosecution at the International Criminal Court, and only subsequently allowed military force to protect civilians.
2014年4月，尽管日本银行已经采取了激进的量化宽松刺激经济增长，但首相安倍晋三坚持按计划将消费税从5%提高到8 % 。	In April 2014, even with the Bank of Japan having pursued aggressive quantitative easing to kick-start economic growth, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe followed through on a planned consumption-tax hike, from 5% to 8%.
就连一向对深化与美国安全关系持谨慎态度的印度现在也已接受地区双边防御的理念 — — 结盟对象不仅包括美国，也包括东亚国家和日本。	Even India, which has been cautious about deepening its security ties with the US, has now embraced the idea of regional mutual defense – not only with America, but also with Japan and other East Asian countries.
尽管管理层宣称他们在追求股东价值，但它们的所作所为通常只体现了自身 — — 尤其是高层管理人员 — — 的利益，对那些持有绝大部分股份的股东并无好处。	Despite their claims that they are pursuing shareholder value, the actions of top managers, in particular, often reflect only their own interests, rather than those of shareholders who often hold the great majority of the shares.
但是，实际房价（已考虑通货膨胀因素）仍比上个高峰期价格低40 % ， 所以房地产市场（以及与之紧密关联的建筑业）不会出现强劲复苏。	But, with real (inflation-adjusted) house prices still 40% below the previous peak, a strong recovery for real estate (and the closely related construction industry) seems unlikely.
第三，在计划的紧缩政策推动经济低于委员会所批准的国民生产总值预估的同时，若干主要旨在影响供给总量的结构性改革据称会将估值推高。	Third, whereas the plan’s contractionary policies push the economy below the Board’s baseline GNP estimates, a number of structural reforms, mostly meant to affect aggregate supply, allegedly push it above.
当务之急是立即采取行动确保每位女孩都能接种HPV疫苗，从而在花样年华不受宫颈癌的困扰，而不管她生活在哪里。	It is imperative to act now to ensure that every girl has access to HPV vaccines and a healthy future free from cervical cancer, no matter where she lives.
在某种程度上，正是市场和大自然那些粗暴而公正的惩罚教会了人们谨慎行事，同时这些惩罚也会带来超出当权者预料之外的成果。	To the extent that the rough justice meted out by markets or nature teaches anyone to behave better, it has consequences far beyond the horizon of anyone in power today.
该框架给伊朗核计划制定了重大限制，包括离心机的数量和类型、反应堆的种类、伊朗可以拥有的浓缩铀的数量和质量等。	The framework places significant limits on Iran’s nuclear program, including the number and type of centrifuges, the sort of reactors, and the amount and quality of enriched uranium that the country may possess.
但在2008年北约布加勒斯特首脑会议上，时任秘书长夏侯雅伯(Jaap de Hoop Scheffer）却声称，乌克兰将在“某个时候”加入。	But it was a kick in the face when, at NATO’s Bucharest summit in 2008, the Alliance’s then-secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, said that Ukraine would “someday” join.
随着这一活动的进行，军事领导人把他们用来增强其压迫权力的虚假投票放在了缅甸人民的健康福祉之前的位置上了。	With this move, the military leaders are putting their sham vote aimed at tightening their repressive grip on power ahead of the well being of the Burmese people.
尽管科帕奇和公民纲领党面临的问题具有波兰特色，但其中也包含一条普遍的真理：要想取胜，政治家必须确定自己所处的执政环境。	Although the problem faced by Kopacz and Civic Platform was specifically Polish, it contains a universal truth: to win, politicians must define the context in which they operate.
此后，沃森又继续取得了大量成就，证明了认知计算可以使用大数据处理某些人类所面临的最困难的系统性问题的。	Since then, Watson has gone on to do much more, demonstrating how cognitive computing can use big data to tackle some of the most difficult systemic issues facing humanity.
如果希腊政府违约或准备放弃欧元，希腊银行将崩溃，无法将钱转移到国外的希腊人将是失去储蓄，就像2013年的塞浦路斯那样。	If the Greek government defaulted or tried to abandon the euro, Greece’s banks would collapse, and Greeks who failed to get their money out of the country would lose their savings, as occurred in Cyprus in 2013.
就算不是“新古典综合派”的唯一创始人，他也是这一学派的发扬光大者。 新古典综合派结合了新古典和凯恩斯主义经济学，占据经济学主流50年之久。	If not the sole originator, he was the great popularizer of the “neoclassical synthesis” – the mix of neoclassical and Keynesian economics that defined the mainstream of the field for 50 years.
并且，当恰当的军队类型和军力确实存在时，由联合国，欧盟，或者临时的国家联盟领导的军事行动以及各个国家的需要，都给这些军队及其军力提出了更多的要求。	And, when the right type of forces and capabilities do exist, operations led by the United Nations, the European Union, or ad hoc coalitions, as well as national requirements, place additional demands on these assets.
在尼日利亚，我在2005年建立了平等权利独立计划（Independent Project for Equal Rights，简称TIGERs ） ， 以应对日益增多的因为性取向受怀疑而丢失工作的人。	In Nigeria, I started the Independent Project for Equal Rights (TIERs) in 2005 to respond to the increasing number of people who were losing their jobs because of suspicions about their sexuality.
发自伦敦 — — 1979年末，我开始撰写自己的博士论文，内容是对欧佩克国家贸易顺差及其使用方式的实证研究。	LONDON – In late 1979, I began work on my PhD thesis, an empirical investigation of the OPEC surplus and its disposal.
在欧洲，最顶层的1%每小时可以赚90欧元 — — 比中位时薪高八倍，更是底层10%的平均时薪的22倍。	In Europe, the top 1% earn about €90 ($95) per hour – eight times more than median-wage earners, and 22 times the average wage of the bottom 10%.
目前，政府已经建议巴西国会修订宪法禁止名义公共支出（包括次国家级公共支出）在未来20年中出现超过前一年通货膨胀率的增长。	Already, it has proposed to Brazil’s Congress a constitutional amendment forbidding for the next 20 years nominal annual increases in public expenditures, including at the subnational level, that exceed the previous year’s inflation rate.
要让A不去伤害B，C的反应可能十分重要，因为如果A知道C会因为他对B做的事而惩罚他，他就会在伤害B之前三思。	To discourage A from hurting B, the reaction of C can be important, because if A knows that C will punish him for what he does to B, he might think twice before hurting B.
此外他们还分属于几个大的部落，这样就能确保如果像埃及那样由军事委员会进行接管，那么部族利益将会得到广泛的代表。	They also belong to several large tribes, guaranteeing wide tribal representation if a military council were to take power, as in Egypt.
在犹太-基督教-伊斯兰传统理论中，人性充满着原罪，但可以通过侍奉上帝来得到救赎，而上帝正是依据他自己的形象创造了我们人类。	In the Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions, human nature is fundamentally corrupted by sin, but can be redeemed by embracing God, in whose image we have been created.
对欧洲工程的新年正在衰退，而由于欧元区缺少团结，停滞和衰退可能导致公众拒绝欧盟，并伴生对民主的严重挑战（比如新法西斯政党的崛起 ） 。	Faith in the European project is declining, and, given the eurozone’s lack of cohesion, stagnation and recession may lead to popular rejection of the EU, accompanied by serious challenges to democracy, including the rise of neo-fascist parties.
但一些新兴动态 — — 未被留意或只是被孤立看待 — — 已经在很大程度上改变了中国共产党和中国社会之间的权力平衡，前者正在逐步丧失信誉和控制力，后者却正获得越来越多的力量和信心。	But several emerging trends, unobserved or noted only in isolation, have greatly altered the balance of power between the CCP and Chinese society, with the former losing credibility and control and the latter gaining strength and confidence.
"如果有一天一些欧洲国家决定创造一个两种速度的欧洲，那么捷克共和国、匈牙利和斯洛伐克的一些领导人则想要加入欧洲一体化的""硬核 "" ， 这会使情况更加复杂化。"	"The situation could become even more complicated, because some leaders in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia would like to join the ""hard core"" of European integration should some European states one day decide to create a two-speed Europe."
在21世纪初，德国公共部门赤字规模为GDP的3 % ， 但如今已经略有盈余，这是一个非常理性的反应，私人退休储蓄的增长亦然。	Whereas the public-sector deficit was 3% of GDP in the early 2000s, Germany runs a small surplus today, which is a perfectly reasonable reaction, as is the increase in private retirement savings.
伦敦－法国总统尼古拉斯·萨科齐最近宣称 ， “ 自由主义结束了 ” 。 或许是这样的，但是如果他的观点正确，我们真的应该感到满意吗？	LONDON – “Laissez-faire,” French President Nicolas Sarkozy recently declared, “is finished.” Perhaps, but should we really be satisfied if he is right?
一个关键是美国继续它在NTD问题上的强势领导地位，在今年和未来几年继续划拨联邦预算为治疗计划提供资金。	It is critical that the US continue its strong leadership on NTDs by maintaining funding for treatment programs in the federal budget, this year and in the years to come.
如果说现在哪一座城市感觉更像欧洲的首都，那么它不是布鲁塞尔、柏林，甚至不是巴黎，而是五十万法国民众和数百万外国人居住的伦敦。	If any city feels like a European capital now, it is not Brussels, Berlin, or even Paris, but London, home to almost a half-million French citizens, as well as millions of other foreigners.
随后，日元/美元汇率急剧升值，从360日元兑1美元升高到80日元兑1美元，世界第二大经济体也因此进入了二十多年的通缩和停滞期。	With the subsequent sharp appreciation in the yen/dollar exchange rate, from ¥360:$1 to ¥80:1, the world’s second-largest economy has suffered through two decades of deflation and stagnation.
侥幸逃脱没有被敌人所占领、并且依然认为是他们独自赢得了第二次世界大战（哦，是的，在美国佬一点点的帮助下）的英国人，依然还带有一点军人的气质。	The English, who escaped occupation by a hostile power, and still believe they won World War II alone (well, with a little help from the Yanks), still have a militaristic streak.
普林斯顿—近几年来，欧盟 — — 或者更准确地说，是北欧强国 — — 一直在以财政清明的名义迫使其较弱成员国进行社会和政治“压力测试 ” 。	PRINCETON – In recent years, the European Union – or, more accurately, the powerful countries of northern Europe – has been subjecting its weaker members to social and political “stress tests” in the name of fiscal rectitude.
而我与鞠建东和施康合作进行的研究表明这一影响要比上述推理所展现的更大：当一个劳动力相对丰富的国家减少进口壁垒时，出口实际上比进口增加更多。	Research I conducted with Jiandong Ju and Kang Shi suggests something even stronger than this: when a relatively labor-abundant country reduces import barriers, exports actually grow more than imports.
如果泰勒还活着，看到目前的局面 — — 各种加剧恐慌的误解、误算和过度反应 — — 他将毫无疑问地体会到似曾相识的警钟。	If Taylor were alive to witness the current situation – characterized by fear-enhancing misperception, miscalculation, and overreaction – he would undoubtedly be feeling an alarming sense of déjà vu.
权力制衡的模式、司法运作以及地方民主必须由欧洲形式得到鼓舞。 与美国类型的盎格鲁萨克逊模式相比，欧洲的形式更为接近格鲁吉亚的现实。	The models for the balance of powers, the functioning of the judiciary, and local democracy must be inspired by European forms, which are closer to Georgian reality than Anglo-Saxon models of the American type.
银行在经济中有着特殊的功能，政府在银行业也扮演着特殊的角色：不是在制定薪酬，而是在控制有效资本范畴。	Banks serve a special function in the economy that does warrant a special role for the government: not in setting pay, but in imposing effective capital requirements.
美国由于忽视了必要的基础设施投资而走上了一条可能导致停滞和衰落的危险的道路，这条道路一旦走上就很难回头。	In neglecting the necessary investments, the US has put itself on a precarious path, one that could lead to stagnation and decline, which would be difficult to reverse.
第二个解释是，班农正在吹响政治集结号，他更加热衷于建立一个持久的民粹主义“运动”而不是让特朗普连任。	The second explanation is that Bannon is calling the political shots, and is more interested in building a permanent populist “movement” than he is in getting Trump reelected.
而且，虽然针对IMF支持的项目仍然需要提出附加的政策条件，这些条件应该完全集中在解决一个国家的关键问题，因此这些条件才会是适宜的，而不是干涉性的。	Moreover, while it remains essential to attach policy conditions to IMF-supported programs, they should be focused squarely on solving a country’s critical problems, so that the conditions will be relevant rather than intrusive.
最后，本月早些时候，美国国际非政府组织人权观察组织（Human Rights Watch，HRW）正式宣布了它的立场 — — 拒绝任何毒品的拥有和消费的除罪化，并呼吁采取截然不同的态度。	Finally, earlier this month, the US-based international NGO Human Rights Watch formally adopted a stance that rejects criminalization of possession and consumption of all drugs and calls for a radically different approach.
当然，欧元区成员国也需要表现出足够的勇气，协力加强预算控制，增进合作，以回应其共同货币所面临的信心危机。	To be sure, eurozone member states also needed the courage to respond to the crisis of confidence confronting the common currency with concerted action for tighter control of national budgets and improved cooperation.
但仍可以计算所有国家的承诺的总效应，这样，明年就可以评估世界是否做了足够的事情将全球变暖程度控制在2℃的上限之内。	But the aggregate effect of all countries’ plans will be calculated, allowing evaluation next year of whether the world has done enough to limit average global warming to the agreed ceiling of 2º Celsius.
如果国际核聚变实验堆真的能够解决地球的能源问题，那么100亿欧元的投资完全可以忽略不计。 它比石油公司总的净利润（2006年是130亿欧元）要少得多，并且不过与伊拉克战争10天的开销相等。	If ITER could really solve the planet’s energy problem, €10 billion would be a negligible investment – less than the net profit of the oil company TOTAL (€13 billion in 2006) and equivalent to ten days of waging the war in Iraq.
而另一方面，安倍却公开否认日本曾强迫中国和朝鲜妇女充当“慰安妇 ” ， 这样的做法往好里说是愚蠢，往差里说是对外界的反应漠不关心。	On the other hand, Abe’s public statements denying Japan���s coercion of “comfort women” in China and Korea have been clumsy at best, insensitive at worst.
这与一些发展中国家的���针形成了鲜明对比，后者不但面临更紧迫的环境和社会挑战，还采取了关于金融体系作用的“发展”观。	This contrasts with the approach of some developing economies, which not only face more immediate environmental and social challenges, but also take a “developmental” view of the financial system’s role.
但真正令人忧心的并不是短期挑战带来的风险，比如2014年日本重新陷入衰退或者欧元区的长期低迷；真正令人担忧的是整个世界将在后半世纪面临的台风级阻力。	But the real worry is not the risk associated with near-term challenges, like Japan’s return to recession in 2014 or the eurozone’s enduring sluggishness; it is the gale-force headwinds that the entire world will face over the next half-century.
纽约 — — 1月肇始于突尼斯、随后蔓延到埃及和西班牙的抗议运动已经波及到了全球，抗议活动已经席卷了华尔街和美国各大城市。	NEW YORK – The protest movement that began in Tunisia in January, subsequently spreading to Egypt, and then to Spain, has now become global, with the protests engulfing Wall Street and cities across America.
PEIC的初衷非常直观：教育为儿童和年轻人提供至关重要的机会，对于生活在冲突区的儿童和年轻人尤其如此。	The rationale underpinning PEIC is straightforward: education provides critical opportunities for children and young people, and this is especially true for those living in conflict zones.
1亿多人仍生活在官方贫困线以下，名义人均收入刚刚跨过6000美元，在这样的情况下，稳健的经济增长是必不可少的。	With more than 100 million people still below the official poverty line and per capita income currently just over $6,000 in nominal terms, robust economic growth must be maintained.
而关于如何避免爆发一场涉及巴基斯坦的危机 — — 以及一旦预防措施失败该如何应对这一危机 — — 的讨论也同样重要。	Talks on how to avoid a crisis involving Pakistan – and how to manage one should prevention fail – are no less urgent.
安倍对1945年后规则和机构的承诺 — — 这些规则和机构让日本从二战的废墟中复苏，也让中国得以和平崛起 — — 是美国授予他国会演讲荣誉的另一个原因。	Abe’s commitment to the rules and institutions of the post-1945 world order, which helped bring Japan out of the ruins of World War II and has allowed China to rise so peacefully, gives the US another reason to honor him.
1979年，毛里塔尼亚退出，西撒哈拉进入摩洛哥和波利萨里奥阵线对峙的时代，后者从西班牙控制时代末期开始主张对该领地的主权。	Mauritania left in 1979, leaving Morocco to confront the Polisario Front, which had announced its claims to the territory in the last years of Spanish control.
关于印度选举的研究一直地表明，最穷群体投票人数远高于国家平均水平，高教育程度中产阶级则远低于国家平均水平。	Studies of Indian elections have consistently shown that the poorest vote in numbers well above the national average, while the educated middle-class turn out in numbers well below it.
在刚刚发布的报告中，国际货币基金组织承认，持续的经济放缓将使2019年的全球经济增速降至3.3 % 。	And in its just released update, the IMF recognizes that the ongoing slowdown will push global growth down to only 3.3% in 2019.
而各国首脑内部及其与欧洲央行之间在购买危机受灾国主权债券方面的意见不一致只是增加了整个事件的不确定性而已。	Disagreement among and between heads of state and the ECB over the Bank’s purchases of distressed sovereign debt have only added to the uncertainty.
他信的政治运程急转直下证明了选举的局限性以及当今困扰许多发展中国家、包括菲律宾在内的地区邻国的民主缺陷。	Thaksin’s rapid reversal of political fortune attests to the limits of the ballot box, as well as to democratic shortcomings that now beset a host of developing countries, including regional neighbors such as the Philippines.
毕竟，物理学家尼尔斯·玻尔（Niels Bohr）讽刺性地指出 ： “ 预言是困难的，特别是对未来的预言 。 ”	After all, as the physicist Niels Bohr wryly noted, “Prediction is difficult, especially about the future.”
尽管他傲慢无礼的风格破坏了结果，但对他的观点（其他很多人也持有相同的观点）视而不见将是不折不扣的悲剧。	While his brash style undermined outcomes, it would be a real tragedy to lose sight of his arguments (which have been made by many others as well).
任何有意义的阿以和平都必须构筑在以色列对巴勒斯坦领土的归还之上（在特定条件下 ） ， 但除非以色列内部的政治权衡有所改变，否则任何一届以色列政府都不愿意甚至不能达成这一点。	Any meaningful Arab-Israeli peace depends on Israel’s return of Palestinian territories, with certain conditions, but no Israeli government will be willing or even able to do so unless the political calculus inside Israel changes.
在美国 — — 追随其经济模式的国家也正在日益变得这样 — — 经济不平等性高企导致了政治不平等性。	High levels of economic inequality in countries like the US and, increasingly, those that have followed its economic model, lead to political inequality.
美国股市40 ％的下挫幅度以及房价的大幅下降已经使美国家庭的财富蒸发了十万多亿美元，这很可能导致每年减少4000多亿美元的消费额。	The 40% decline in the US stock market and the dramatic fall in house prices have reduced American households’ wealth by more than $10 trillion, which is likely to reduce annual consumer spending by more than $400 billion.
该计划的主要特点就是将原本着眼于GDP增长最大化的官方政策转变为对消费以及劳动者平均生活水平的提高。	Its key feature is to shift official policy from maximizing GDP growth toward raising consumption and average workers’ standard of living.
在世界经济论坛（World Economic Forum）的《2013年全球性别差异报告 》 （ Global Gender Gap Report 2013）中，日本名列136个国家的第150位，较2012年的第101位有所下降。	Japan ranked 105th out of 136 countries in the World Economic Forum’s “Global Gender Gap Report 2013,” down from 101st place in 2012.
如此这般地恶性循环。 由于此项政策，外国银行不得不在压力下，裁减自身的员工来保留低效率的所在国员工。	The number of inefficient workers protected by these measures is offset by the number of efficient workers laid off by foreign multinationals responding to political pressures in their home country.
但如果你像我一样拥有30年的从军经验，就会知道有效的计划一定不会是静止不变的；计划的执行环境往往出现出人意料或令人惊讶的变化。	But if you’ve spent 30 years in the military, as I have, you know that an effective plan cannot be static; operating environments change, often in surprising or unexpected ways.
即便如此，沙特仍竭尽全力吸引穆斯林、尤其是富有穆斯林前来朝圣，他们兴建大型购物中心和伦敦大本钟等旅游景点，后者与克尔白圣寺近在咫尺显得十分不协调。	Even so, it maintains strenuous efforts to attract pilgrims – particularly wealthy ones – by building attractions, including vast shopping malls and a colossal copy of London’s Big Ben that now looms incongruously over the Ka‘ba.
布鲁塞尔—美国联邦调查局和中央情报局都认定俄罗斯进行了黑客和造谣行动，目标是影响美国总统大选，让唐纳德·特朗普获利。	BRUSSELS – The United States FBI and CIA have both concluded that Russia ran a hacking and disinformation campaign aimed at influencing the US presidential election in Donald Trump’s favor.
2008年时期的一些思维（恐怕是大部分吧？ ）极有可能来源于一个事实，即存在对货币经济学家来说相当真实和实在的东西。	Some of the 2008-era mindset (most of it?) most likely stemmed from the fact that there are things that are very real and solid to monetary economists.
改革埃及经济、使之能够受惠于其9,500万人口（外加每年新增的两百万人 ） ， 对任何人来说都是一个异常艰巨的任务。	It would be a Herculean feat for anyone to reform Egypt’s economy so that it benefits the country’s 95 million people (plus the two million added every year).
随着我们的社会变得越来越富裕，我们开始相信每个人都有资格获得某种最低标准，不管是在工作、生病或是失业问题上，从而使他们能够持续获得一定水平的安逸和成功。	As our societies have become richer, we have come to believe that everyone is entitled to a minimum standard, whether in work or sickness or unemployment, which allows for a continuing level of comfort and flourishing.
人们尽可以提到《2010年多德—弗兰克法案》来辩解，但以20世纪30年代的标准来看，那个法案简直是清汤寡水。	Say what you will about the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, but it is weak soup by the standards of the 1930’s.
每年蒸汽轮船中塞得满满当当的数十万朝圣者被指在孟买和汉堡等港口城市传播霍乱，导致麦加朝圣成为世界主要的死亡原因之一。	Annual influxes of hundreds of thousands of pilgrims closely packed into steamships were blamed for spreading cholera through port cities from Bombay to Hamburg, making the hajj a major cause of death around the world.
但石油出口表现的回落、基础设施相关进口激增以及公共支出的爆炸式增长导致委内瑞拉通胀居高不下，当前年通胀率高达20%以上。	Yet stumbling oil-export performance and a sharp rise in infrastructure-related imports, combined with an explosive growth in public spending, have fueled consistently high levels of inflation, with the annual rate now at more than 20%.
而在重��认识到经济是无法从一个缺乏结构性转换的局部竞争力修复中得益之后，政府在2013年春季通过了一项重大的劳动市场改革。	Recognizing that the economy could not benefit from a partial restoration of competitiveness without structural shifts, the government passed a significant labor-market reform in the spring of 2013.
要治理这个现象，G20应该建立一个世界竞争网络（World Competition Network）以重塑竞争、解决劳资之间的收入不平等。	To address this phenomenon, the G20 should create a World Competition Network to restore competition and address income inequality between capital and labor.
根据WTO规则，国际贸易企业需遵守与国内企业相同的国家法规，贸易商在贸易伙伴所属国的法院拥有与该国国民相同的权利。	Under WTO rules, international trading firms are subject to the same national regulations as domestic firms, and traders have the same rights as nationals in trade partners’ courts.
正如美国的情况，问题不在于种族和种姓保留和优先，而在于确保所有人，无论贫富都能接受到高质量的初级教育。	As in America, the issue is not racial and class reservations and preferences, but ensuring high-quality primary education for all, rich and poor alike.
同样，世行的私营部门机构国际金融公司已经成立了国际金融公司（IFC）伊斯兰债券公司，并于2015年发行了1亿美元的信托证书。	Similarly, the Bank’s private-sector arm, the International Financial Corporation, has established the IFC Sukuk Company, which issued $100 million in trust certificates in 2015.
CEO和高管团队必须改变经营方式，为同事普及多样性所包含的巨大商机，下大功夫识别、训练和教导不论种族出身的有才干的个人。	CEOs and senior management teams must revamp their operations, remind their colleagues of the strong business case for diversity, and make a much stronger effort to identify, train, and mentor talented individuals of all races.
美国经济约是中国的两倍，如果它每年增长2 % ， 中国经济每年增长6 % ， 那么在2025年后某个时间它们将平起平坐。	The US economy is about twice the size of China’s; if it grows by only 2% annually, and China’s economy grows by 6%, they could reach parity sometime after 2025.
对于美国当局而言，他们视发生在阿富汗、伊拉克、巴勒斯坦以及黎巴嫩的真主党的反恐战争的每个行动都是互不相关、各成一体的。	To the US administration, every act in the drama of the war on terror was seen as discrete and self-contained: Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
在1990年代的波斯尼亚和科索沃战争期间，塞尔维亚独裁者斯洛博丹·米洛舍维奇（Slobodan Milošević）将马其顿人称之为迷失了方向的“友善小兄弟 ” 。	During the Bosnian and Kosovo wars of the 1990s, the Serbian dictator Slobodan Milošević described the people of Macedonia as “kind little brothers” who had lost their way.
反响在全世界都能体验到，并将继续给公共政策、选举政治、言论自由和其他方面造成影响 — — 并且远远不止于欧洲。	The reverberations are being felt around the world, and they will continue to have an impact – far beyond Europe – on public policy, electoral politics, media freedom, and more.
"丑陋的犹太人""成了上述诽谤的有力工具，而所谓新保守主义者被认做美军国主义和以残暴行径的罪魁祸首，并分别命名为：Wolfowitz, Perle, Abrams和Kristol如此等等。"	"""The ugly Jew"" becomes the instrumental part of this defamation when so-called neoconservatives are blamed both for American militarism and Israeli brutalities and then selectively named: Wolfowitz, Perle, Abrams, Kristol, etc."
事实上两国之间有着千丝万缕的联系：无论是历史，文化，还是经济和地理，还共享着超过1300英里的边界线。	Indeed, our countries are joined by every possible link: history, culture, economics, and geography, with more than 1,300 miles of shared border.
最好现在就提高50个基准点¾这样就能在控制通胀的同时允许经济继续恢复下去，也比今后让通货膨胀翻三番或四番强。	Better a 50-basis-point increase now – thereby allowing the economic recovery to continue by keeping inflation in check – than triple or quadruple that figure down the road.
有鉴于此，也许真正的问题在于，当其他新兴市场国家纷纷以某种形式采取了资本账户管制时，土耳其为何不这么做。	Given this, perhaps the real question is why Turkey refrained from using capital-account regulations, when almost all of its emerging-market counterparts were using them in some form.
中国有着巨量的流动性 — — M2（货币供应量的常用指标）达到了中国GDP的两倍 — — 而借贷成本仍在升高，这毫无意义。	In a country with a huge amount of liquidity – M2 (a common measure of the money supply) amounts to double China’s GDP – and still-rising borrowing costs, this makes little sense.
因为太多频道全天候竞争同一副眼球和目标收视率（TRP ） ， 电视新闻早已不再装作提供任何公共服务，而是明目张胆地追求感官刺激，而非内容。	With far too many channels competing 24/7 for the same sets of eyeballs and target rating points (TRPs), television news has long since abandoned any pretense of providing a public service, and instead blatantly privileges sensation over substance.
要知道产业政策对于发展中国家来说可是个久经考验的战略，可以帮助它们从进口转向本土创新从而避免落入可怕的中等收入陷阱。	Never mind that industrial policies are a time-tested strategy for developing countries seeking to avoid the dreaded middle-income trap by shifting from imported to indigenous innovation.
许多大学生直接被挤压到原本由低技能劳工承担的职业层次，而后者则被压到下一个层次甚至直接被排挤出劳动力市场。	Many college-educated workers simply have been forced down the occupational ladder into jobs traditionally performed by lower-skilled workers, who in turn have been pushed further down the occupational ladder or out of the labor force altogether.
比如，20世纪70年代，和其他共产主义国家一样，捷克斯洛伐克是一个沉闷、压抑、毫无乐趣可言的地方，平庸的党的御用文人决定着基调，创造力被强制的因循守旧所压制。	In the 1970s, for example, Czechoslovakia, like other Communist states, was a dreary, oppressive, joyless place, where mediocre party hacks set the tone, and creativity was stifled under a blanket of enforced conformism.
贱民和印度的原住民（宪法中所列的“贱民和部落 ” ） 在印度的543人组成的议会中有权获得85个席位，这是为他们的社区“保留”的席位。	Dalits and India’s aboriginals (listed in the Constitution as “Scheduled Castes and Tribes”) are entitled to 85 seats in India’s 543-member parliament that are “reserved” for candidates from their communities.
但拉美和南欧的状况或许暴露了左翼势力一个更大的弱点：那就是缺少重塑21世纪资本主义和全球化的明确计划。	But the experience in Latin America and southern Europe reveals perhaps a greater weakness of the left: the absence of a clear program to refashion capitalism and globalization for the twenty-first century.
颇具影响力的活动家乔治·蒙比奥特表示“气候变化”这个字眼还不足以令人警醒，因此应当用“气候崩溃”这个词来取代它。	Influential campaigner George Monbiot says “climate change” isn’t alarming enough, so should be replaced with “climate breakdown.”
不管怎么说，有关印度独立运动的概念过于复杂，尼赫鲁的理想已经得到很好的实施，现在是将甘地的理念请回来的时候了。	After all, it was out of their complicated marriage of ideas that independent India was born. Nehru’s vision has had a good run; now it is time to bring back Gandhi’s.
州立法者通过一项法案禁止决策者采用该小组的研究成果，从而阻止官员履行保护国家海岸线、资源和民众的基本职责。	State legislators responded by passing a bill that prohibited policymakers from using the panel’s findings, thereby undermining officials’ ability to fulfill their fundamental duty to protect their state’s coastline, resources, and citizens.
除了暴力问题，由于俄罗斯当局未能意识到公众日益增长的疏远感，其可能还会因此受到一项巨大的历史考验 ， 。	Beyond the issue of violence, the Russian authorities would take a huge historical risk by failing to register the public’s growing alienation.
结果，占全球排放总量40%的49个国家的温室气体排放已经见顶；甚至有十个国家承诺到2050年实现碳中性。	As a result, GHG emissions have already peaked in 49 countries that account for 40% of global emissions; and ten countries have even committed to being carbon-neutral by 2050.
中国政府不仅仅是花掉钱，而且似乎总是喜欢像摩天大楼，华丽的政府建筑物，公路以及大工业项目这样有形的东西 。 ”	The government doesn’t just spend it, but seems always to favor tangible things like skyscrapers, fancy government buildings, highways, and big industrial projects.
在本文写作之时，他仍然为其工作的准确性辩护，同时承认在保持干细胞株时出现了“人为错误 ” ， 包括受到真菌感染。	At the time of this writing, he still defends the validity of his work, while admitting “human errors” in the preservation of the stem-cell lines, including contamination by a fungus.
但第一步是关税联盟，而在欧亚联盟的例子中，关税联盟必须包括位于俄罗斯西部的其最大邻国 — — 乌克兰。	But the first step is a customs union, and, in the case of the Eurasian Union, it had to include Ukraine, Russia’s largest neighbor to the west.
民意调查，其中包括斯坦利·格林伯格（Stanley Greenberg）及其在罗斯福研究所的同僚的详细研究，表明贸易是相当一部分美国人的主要不满情绪来源之一。	Opinion polls, including a careful study by Stanley Greenberg and his associates for the Roosevelt Institute, show that trade is among the major sources of discontent for a large share of Americans.
然而问题是这种支持的态度经常急剧变化并形成一个支持欧盟的“软性集团 ” ， 但就在2008年公投前最后一周的关键时刻，这个“软性集团”却走向了土崩瓦结。	The problem is that these favorable attitudes vary considerably in intensity and constitute a “soft bloc” of support for the EU; in the 2008 referendum, this soft bloc crumbled in the final week of the campaign.
卢旺达政府最近在全国课程体系中纳入了阿卡兹·卡诺泽计划的方法，让中等学校和TVET学生具备取得成功所需要的软技能。	The government recently integrated Akazi Kanoze’s approach in the national curriculum to equip secondary and TVET students with the soft skills they require to succeed.
不仅如此，土耳其入盟将不可避免的导致乌克兰、白俄罗斯、摩尔多瓦，也许还有格鲁吉亚、亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆这些国家纷纷入盟。	Moreover, Turkey’s accession would lead inevitably to that of Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaïdjan.
金边-胡志明市高速公路上的新海关工程让木牌（Moc Bai ） - 巴域（Bavet）边境通关贸易总量在三年内增加了40 % 。	A new customs component to a highway project between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City helped increase the total value of trade through the Moc Bai-Bavet border by 40% over three years.
很能说明问题的是，美联储已经开始采取温和的升息，而没有引发消极反应，哪怕是在去年对升息有如惊弓之鸟的新兴市场也是如此。	It is telling that the US Federal Reserve has now pursued modest interest-rate hikes without triggering an adverse reaction even in emerging markets, which last year were dreading such a move.
而就连这样都没能满足这帮人的胃口，两党在 1992 年又通过一条法律，规定给两家 — — 可不包括其他党派 — — 各分配一个国家电视台。	Not content with this, the two parties passed a law in 1992 that gave each of them – and no other parties – a national TV station.
通过持照培训师网络的直接参与，跳板女性发展计划已经被40多个国家超过 230,000 名妇女所使用。	Delivered by a network of licensed trainers, the Springboard Women’s Development Programme has already been used by over 230,000 women in more than 40 countries.
即便埃及避免了被极端宗教组织控制的局面，但民主的两大组成部分将使向民主系统的转化和平稳过渡问题重重。	Even if Egypt avoids control by religious extremists, democracy’s two-part anatomy makes swift and smooth progress to a democratic system problematic.
如今，这些立场并不太坚定的选民中有很多惊愕于退欧让人们的注意力从他们真正的怨恨对象 — — 医疗、不平等性、低工资、住房和其他问题 — — 上转移开去。	Many of these low-conviction voters are now dismayed that Brexit has distracted attention from their real grievances about health, inequality, low wages, housing, and other issues.
2006年，艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）从他干了18年的美联储主席任上退休，其时名誉如日中天。	In 2006, when Alan Greenspan retired after his 18-year reign as Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board, his reputation could hardly have been higher.
经常项目即是一国储蓄率和投资率之差，而储蓄率和投资率受到人口结构的严重影响，因此我们需要考虑人口动态的变化。	Given that the current account is the difference between a country’s saving and investment rates, both of which are heavily influenced by demographics, we need to consider rapid changes in population dynamics.
这些政策的最好的独立评估来自国会预算办公室（CBO ） ， 它的评估表明不会发生任何经济奇迹 — — 只是有大约2,000万美国人将失去医保。	The best independent assessment of these policies, produced by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), does not predict any economic miracles – just that around 20 million fewer Americans will have health insurance.
无论工业化发生在哪里，它都勿庸置疑地促进了经济多样化，有助于培育、加强和维护竞争性发展和增长所需的环境。	Wherever industrialization has occurred, it has reliably improved economic diversification and helped to nurture, strengthen, and uphold the conditions for competitive growth and development.
结果 ， 《 Oragir》被关闭，这迫使我们不得不以《Haykakan Zhamanak》的名字出现。	These manipulations worked: Oragir was closed down, which forced us to appear under the name Haykakan Zhamanak .
相反，中国实现了经济分散化，但保留了中央政治集权，经济管理责任大体上被下放到省级，而这导致了中国自身的失衡问题。	By contrast, China achieved economic decentralization, but preserved centralized political power, transferring economic-management responsibilities largely to provincial officials, which has created its own imbalances.
如果金融传染病程度有限，希腊是唯一的受害者，那么欧元区产出尽管将受严重打击，但不至于出现灾难性后果。	Should contagion prove to be limited, with Greece the only casualty, the drop in eurozone output may be severe, but not catastrophic.
1989年10月，老布什响应科尔的呼吁，公开声称他不“同意一些欧洲国家对重新统一的德国的担心 ” 。	In October 1989, Bush responded to a call from Kohl by publicly stating that he did not “share the concern that some European countries have about a reunified Germany.”
例如，土耳其总理塔伊普·埃尔多安打破传统，对以色列针对被占领土的更为强硬的政策表示批评，而又没有导致两国的外交关系恶化。	For example, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan broke with tradition by displaying a critical attitude toward Israel’s more hawkish policies in the occupied territories, and did so without severing diplomatic relations with Israel.
但在非洲绝大部分地区，廉价的药品、训练有素的医生和护士都极为短缺，这意味着患者很少能够得到他们所需要的护理服务。	Yet, in much of Africa, a lack of affordable medications, and a dearth of trained doctors and nurses, means that patients rarely receive the care they need.
在雷恩，讨论生殖医疗问题的专家组支持不允许为卵子或精子付费的政策 — — 甚至连提高“费用”标准的后门也要取消。	In Rennes, the panel debating reproductive medical issues supported the policy of not paying for eggs or sperm – not even by the back door of increasing the level of “expenses.”
为了评估原因，最近牛津大学纳菲尔德学院组织了一次研讨班，讨论的焦点是缺少一个主权实体有能力保护作为一个整体的欧洲经济免受肇始于其他地区的危机的影响。	To assess why, a recent symposium on the subject at Nuffield College, Oxford, focused on the lack of a sovereign authority able to protect the European economy as a whole from contagious crises starting elsewhere.
但即便风能再多，也只能在边际上改善能源安全，因为英国仍必须进口与从前同样多的石油（风能取代的大多是煤炭，很少能取代石油）和天然气，即仍必须依赖俄罗斯。	But even much higher supplies of wind power would improve security only marginally, because the UK would still have to import just as much oil (wind replaces mostly coal, rarely oil) and much of its gas, leaving it dependent on Russia.
发达国家 — — 全球变暖的主要贡献者 — — 一定要兑现他们去年十二月在巴黎联合国气候会谈中所作出的承诺。	Developed countries – the major contributors to global warming – must live up to the promises they made at the COP21 climate talks in Paris last December.
纽约—美国需要把支出从战争转移到教育上，从中央情报局（CIA）支持的颠覆政权活动转移到新的全球教育基金（GFE）上。	NEW YORK – The United States needs to shift its spending from war to education, from CIA-backed regime change to a new Global Fund for Education (GFE).
对国家间互动的理解不当的后果一再使世界主要央行成为灯下黑 — — 比如欧元危机以及欧洲银行对来自美国货币市场基金的融资的严重依赖。	The consequences of poorly understood interconnections among countries have repeatedly blind-sided the world’s major central banks – consider the euro crisis or European banks’ heavy reliance on financing from US-based money-market funds.
最近与日本签署的自贸协定将导致欧盟在农业领域对美国取得明显的优势，而随着美国重新谈判北美自由贸易协定，加强与墨西哥的贸易关系也有可能产生类似的影响。	The free-trade agreement recently signed with Japan will give the EU a clear advantage over the US in agriculture, and strengthening trade ties with Mexico could have a similar impact, as the US renegotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement.
这意味着判定究竟哪些工作岗位需要填补，并欢迎的接纳那些因此而来的人，不是将他们视为外人，而是平等的公民。	This means working out what jobs need to be filled, and welcoming those who will fill them, not as guests, but as equal citizens.
政府和国际出资人无法独力承受如此巨大的资金，它们必须制定能够将更大比例的全球储蓄（目前每年高达约22万亿美元）引向SDG。	With governments and international donors unable to foot the bill alone, they must develop programs and policies that can channel a larger share of global savings, which now amount to roughly $22 trillion annually, toward the SDGs.
人民党将参加一月份的议会选举的决定，不啻为贝•布托抛给穆沙拉夫的一个救生索，要知道总统先生已经被国内的多起叛乱、全国性的恐怖主义威胁和他本人的合法性问题困扰很久了。	In deciding that her People’s Party would participate in the January parliamentary election, Bhutto threw a lifeline to Musharraf, who has been beset by multiple insurgencies, a nationwide terrorist threat, and rock-bottom legitimacy.
与此同时，欧元区也必须对外国投资更加开放，富于现金的中国公司应该继续通过FDI和公司收购寻找在欧洲的机会。	Meanwhile, the eurozone will likely be more open to foreign investment out of necessity, and cash-rich Chinese companies should continue to pursue opportunities via FDI or corporate acquisitions.
考虑到当今世界迈向更紧密的经济一体化的潮流不可阻挡 — — 并且必将随之带来愉快的或肆意的政治一体化深化 — — 这一点尤其重要。	This is particularly true in view of today’s unstoppable progress toward closer economic integration, which will lead, happily or haphazardly, to greater political integration.
朝鲜官方将其视为无所不能的天才，他像神一样被人们所崇拜，只要一露面身边总是如众星捧月，身上挂满了奖章的朝鲜最高军事指挥官追随在他左右，金正恩总是大笑或者鼓掌，或者歇斯底里地大声叫喊。	Officially regarded as an omnipotent genius, he is worshipped like a god and shown constantly surrounded by people, including his highest military officers festooned in medals, laughing or clapping, or shouting hysterically.
如果未来十年，中低收入国家能以富裕国家2000到2013年的速度改善非传染性疾病的预防和治疗环境，五百万人的死亡将能够得以避免。	If, over the next decade, low- and middle-income countries could improve NCD prevention and treatment at the same rate as the average rich country from 2000 to 2013, they would avert more than five million deaths.
首先，自2005年以来约30%的实际汇率升值率无疑对出口商造成了严重影响，沿海城市很多企业破��（或是升级）的情况都反映了这点。	First, the roughly 30% real exchange-rate appreciation since 2005 must have had a serious impact on exporters, reflected in the bankruptcy – as well as the upgrading – of many enterprises in coastal areas.
然而，虽然很多技术细节需要被具体化，我们有世界上最聪明的一群人正在相关的监管机构工作，所以这并不构成问题。	But, though many technical details need to be fleshed out, some of the world’s smartest people work in the relevant regulatory agencies.
总之，欧盟的“联邦”公司税应该被看作是一种福利税，它以对广泛的经营行为的度量为基础，采用适中的税率，不与当前收益挂钩；它也不应该从其他税收中扣除。	In sum, the EU “federal” corporate tax should be thought of as a benefit tax, based on a broad measure of activity, applied at a moderate rate, and unrelated to current returns; nor should it be deductible from other taxes.
如果能实现这一点，美国企业就可以在中国做生意而无须被迫支付如此巨大的竞争代价，而关税的威胁也将成为一个极为有效的贸易政策工具。	If that happens, and US firms can do business in China without being compelled to pay such a steep competitive price, the threat of tariffs will have been a very successful tool of trade policy.
的确，全社会固定投资已前所未有地接近国内生产总值的50 % ， 但住宅及非住宅投资合计仅占其中15－20%的份额 — — 不超过经济总量的10 % 。	Yes, total fixed investment is approaching an unprecedented 50% of GDP, but residential and nonresidential real estate, combined, accounts for only 15-20% of that – no more than 10% of the overall economy.
这些资本每年产生的回报目前估计为600亿吨，而其中只有200亿吨作为食物被消耗，100亿吨被用作能源。	The annual return on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tons, yet only two billion tons is consumed for food purposes and 10 billion tons for energy.
最佳融资办法之一是支持国际教育融资便利（International Finance Facility for Education ） ， 这是一个由教育委员会牵头发起的计划，能够释放有史以来最大规模的全球教育投资。	One of the best ways to do this is by supporting the International Finance Facility for Education, an initiative spearheaded by the Education Commission that could unlock the greatest global investment in education ever recorded.
这场向我们呼啸而来的经济海啸发源于美国 — — 虽然与欧洲无关，但是我们这些国家中的右翼力量已经和控制欧洲的主要力量达成一致，对其表示支持。	This economic tsunami has come to us from the United States – there is nothing in it for Europe, but the right-wing forces in all our countries, which have coalesced into the majority that governs Europe, have rallied to its support.
如果这一目标实现，到2030年所有构架的新生儿死亡率都将低于每1,000新生儿12例 — — 这一比例是撒哈拉以南非洲一些地区当前水平的四分之一。	If this target is met, by 2030 no country will have a neonatal mortality rate above 12 deaths per 1,000 births – a quarter of the current rate in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.
诺贝尔经济学奖得主安格斯·迪顿（Angus Deaton）指出 ， “ 疯狂的是，一些全球化反对者忘记了十亿人主要因为全球化而摆脱了贫困 。 ”	As the Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton argues, “what is crazy is that some of the opponents of globalization forget that a billion people have come out of poverty largely because of globalization.”
这要求接受在私人和公共部门债务上的巨大损失，并支付巨大的转移成本以提振产出停滞不前的外围国的收入水平。	This would require accepting massive losses on public and private debt, as well as enormous transfer payments that boost the periphery’s income while its output stagnates.
事实上，美国本国复杂的宗教-国家关系史使其不愿干预任何外部宗教群体，特别是这一群体的人数很少的情况。	In fact, America’s complicated history of church-state relations at home has made it reluctant to intervene on the part of any religious groups abroad, especially when the population is small.
但在2011年，军政府时期以将军身份担任总理的吴登盛在就任总统前开始采取令最狐疑的观察者也觉得了不起的步骤。	But in 2011, shortly before assuming the presidency, Sein, a general who served as Prime Minister under the junta, began to take steps that impressed even the most skeptical observers.
欧盟委员会、欧洲央行和国际货币基金组织（IMF）预计到财政紧缩将导致巨大的收入和就业代价 — — 尽管它们大幅低估了这一代价到底有多大。	The European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund anticipated that fiscal austerity would be costly to incomes and employment – though they significantly underestimated just how costly.
更危险的是，一些美国决策者仍在戏言向朝鲜发动“血鼻子 ” （ bloody nose）攻击的可能性 — — 这一决定将造成数十万人死亡。	More dangerous, some US policymakers continue to entertain the possibility of delivering a “bloody nose” strike to the North – a decision that could cost hundreds of thousands of lives.
其次，印度正与伊朗合作在阿曼湾建造深海港口查巴哈，目的在于帮助印度绕过其区域竞争对手巴基斯坦去进军阿富汗和中亚。	Second, India has cooperated with Iran to build the Iranian deep-water port of Chabahar on the Gulf of Oman, intended to help India bypass its regional rival, Pakistan, in gaining access to Afghanistan and Central Asia.
近几年来，政府在提供基本医疗方面（特别是农村地区）做出了巨大的努力，一些人认为中国的方法类似于英国，即在公共供给的基础上加上私人供给。	In recent years, the government has made important strides in providing basic health care, especially in rural areas, and some have likened China’s approach to that of the United Kingdom, where private provision is layered atop a public base.
事实证明这种政策已经遭到失败 — — 将稳定置于民主之上致使这两个目标都渐行渐远，孤立无援的和平努力并未取得任何成效。	This policy proved to be a failure – placing stability ahead of democracy brought neither, and isolated peace efforts went nowhere.
与特朗普的指责相反，过去十年来，巴基斯坦一直在反恐和巩固民主制度方面取得了尽管缓慢、但却稳健的进步。	Contrary to Trump’s accusations, Pakistan has made steady, albeit slow, progress over the last decade, both in combating terrorism and in consolidating democratic institutions.
现在，特朗普因为不支持自己的情报部门和执法机构所提供的关于他的朋友俄罗斯总统普京的情报，而是相信普金对他做出的保证，而受到口诛笔伐。	Now Donald Trump is being heavily criticized for failing to take the side of his own intelligence services and law enforcement agencies when their findings about his friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, ran counter to what Putin assured him.
这两种做法最终都将无以为继，因为这两种做法要不是产生无法忍受的通胀率，要不就会造成无法承受的公共部门债务负担。	Both arrangements will eventually become untenable, because they will generate either an intolerable rate of inflation or an unsustainable burden of public-sector debt.
而如今，美国国用它的大智慧，在为了避免政府关门的人达成的最新协议中，将这个数字再度提高了3,000亿美元。	And now the US Congress, in its infinite wisdom, has upped the ante by another $300 billion in the latest deal to avert a government shutdown.
它还可以向更成熟的领域挺近，只要投资和教育可以跟进，并且能够进一步发展诸如波兰东南部航空谷（Dolina Lotnicza）这样的产业集群。	It could move into even more sophisticated areas with additional investment in education and further development of industry clusters such as Dolina Lotnicza (Aviation Valley) in southeastern Poland.
尽管欧洲各国领导致力于挽救欧元，但在维系欧元运作的必要措施方面，各国领导对此的认识缺陷却逐渐暴露出来。	It is increasingly evident that Europe’s political leaders, for all their commitment to the euro’s survival, do not have a good grasp of what is required to make the single currency work.
从1990年代末到2000年，许多观察家都认为共产党的统治已经是强弩之末，肯定会走上由东欧剧变作为开端的“列宁主义灭亡”之路。	From the late 1980’s until 2000, many observers presented the Party as being on its last legs, certain to succumb to the “Leninist extinction” that began with communism’s collapse in Europe.
约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）指出在大萧条这类情况下财政刺激手段是有优势的。	John Maynard Keynes pointed out the advantages of fiscal stimulus in circumstances like the Great Depression.
希腊激进左翼联盟（Syriza）这个激进左翼政党在国家经济危机中支持率飙升，并最有可能在大选中胜出，但它不太可能获得足够的议会席位而实现单独执政。	Syriza, a radical left-wing party whose popularity has skyrocketed amid the country’s economic crisis, is the favorite to win, though it is unlikely to gain enough parliamentary seats to govern alone.
不管从生物学还是从症候方面都无法区分这些不同类型的病症，于是我们看到了一个连续统 — — 最有可能是复杂性而不是严重性的连续统。	It has proved to be impossible to distinguish, either biologically or symptomatically, between different varieties of these conditions, which thus constitute a continuum – most likely of complexity, rather than severity.
举一个特别有争议的例子，航空公司现在使用旅客的数据来定制机票价格，而此举基本上抵消了在线市场曾经所提供的优惠。	To take one particularly controversial example, airlines now use travelers’ data to customize ticket prices in ways that essentially cancel out the savings once offered by online markets.
最重要的是，美国和中国应当避免激发对各自实力和意图的过度恐惧，因为对冲突的预期本身也可能成为冲突的导火索。	Most importantly, the US and China should avoid developing exaggerated fears of each other’s capacities and intentions. The expectation of conflict can itself become a cause of conflict.
因为这些冲突牵扯到很多历史问题，外来势力－特别是俄国的介入－使它们的解决难上加难，但解决这些遗留问题却是改革成功不可缺少的前提。	While these conflicts involve historical grievances, outside actors - particularly Russia - contribute to their lack of resolution, which is essential for successful reform.
全球储备货币的年发行量（凯恩斯所谓的Bancor ，或国际货币基金组织所谓的SDR）可以有助于引发全球的总需求以及用于促进发展和解决全球变暖的问题。	Annual emissions of a global reserve currency (what Keynes called Bancor, or the IMF calls SDRs) could help fuel global aggregate demand, and be used to promote development and address the problems of global warming.
可是美国企业研究所的报告指出从2005到2016年间中国企业在美国仅进行了包括合并和受购在内的202笔投资，其中只有16项 — — 总共涉及210亿美元 — — 是在科技领域。	Yet the American Enterprise Institute reports that, from 2005 to 2016, Chinese companies have made just 202 investments, including mergers and acquisitions, in the US, only 16 of which – totaling $21 billion – were in technology sectors.
世界经济论坛调查结果显示中东和北非性别差距最大，女性在工作场所平均平等率仅有40 % ， 而北美地区则接近80 % 。	The WEF’s findings show that the Middle East and North Africa suffer from the widest gender gap, with women reaching only 40% of parity in the workplace, on average, compared with nearly 80% in North America.
但上述国家改革的外部环境是以全球化激增和快速经济增长为特色 — — 与今天的普遍环境存在很大的差别。	But the external context in which those countries reformed – characterized by surging globalization and rapid growth – was very different from that prevailing today.
以量化宽松的方式进行市场操纵是否完成了目标 — — 为饱受危机冲击、依赖资产的经济提供刺激 — — 仍有待争议：毕竟，目前发达世界的复苏相当萎靡。	Whether the QE strain of market manipulation has accomplished its objective – to provide stimulus to crisis-torn, asset-dependent economies – is debatable: Current recoveries in the developed world, after all, have been unusually anemic.
显然，普京认为对邻国不断施加旨在破坏其主权、迫使其接受俄罗斯要求的压力和主张能让俄罗斯更强大、更有能力对抗西方。	Evidently, Putin believes that relentless pressure and claims over neighboring states, designed to undermine their sovereignty and force them to accede to Russian demands, will result in a stronger Russia, better able to confront the West.
而在当英国的国际收支逆差相当于GDP的5％以上时（位列经合组织第二大 ） ， 金融业这相当于GDP3%的贸易顺差就成为了防范外部危机的必需品。	And at a time when the UK’s balance-of-payments deficit is over 5% of GDP (the second largest in the OECD), the financial sector’s 3%-of-GDP trade surplus has been essential to prevent an external blowout.
在政治转型期 — — 比如一场军事胜利 — — 皇帝也许会指定一个特殊的“年号”来帮助庆祝这个好消息。	During moments of political transition – a military victory, for example – the emperor might designate a special “era name” to help celebrate the good news.
在美国。 某些最激进的犹太复国主义者竟然是新教徒，他们甚至坚信那些不愿意改信基督教的犹太人最终将受到上天的严厉惩罚。	In the United States, some of the fiercest defenders of hardline Zionism are evangelical Christians who firmly believe that Jews who refuse to convert to Christianity will one day face terrible retribution.
全球经济有可能陷入“新平庸 ” （ new mediocre ） — —长时间的慢增长和就业创造萎靡。	The global economy risks getting stuck in a “new mediocre” – a prolonged period of slow growth and feeble job creation.
这种模糊的关系解释了为什么尽管许多经济学家和决策者热衷于推行提高灵活性的改革措施，但事实证明在就业保护和劳动力市场绩效之间建立明确的实证关系是非常困难的。	This ambiguity explains why it has proved difficult to establish a clear empirical relationship between employment protection and labor-market performance, despite the enthusiasm of many economists and policymakers for flexibility-enhancing reforms.
相反，那些有土地的人不得不将他们生产的大部分东西上缴给当地的领主，而领主可以在农民去世后没收他们的土地。	Instead, those with land had to hand over most of what they produced to the local seigneur (lord) who could confiscate their land upon their death (“mainmorte”).
英国M42高速公路智能交通系统让旅途耗时缩短了25 % ， 事故减少了50 % ， 污染减少了10 % ， 燃料消费减少了4 % 。	The UK’s intelligent transport system on the M42 motorway has reduced journey times by 25%, accidents by 50%, pollution by 10%, and fuel consumption by 4%.
发自华盛顿特区 — — 随着中国对全球事务的影响力日渐增大，全世界也正以一种前所未有的仔细态度观察这个世界大国将以何种面目面对世人。	WASHINGTON, DC – As China’s clout in global affairs grows, the world is watching more closely than ever to see what kind of great power it will become.
鉴于欧洲金融部门在化石燃料资产上的投资超过1万亿欧元（约合 1.1万亿美元 ） ， 欧盟所面临的碳泡沫风险尤其巨大。	Given that the European financial sector has invested more than €1 trillion ($1.1 trillion) in fossil-fuel assets, the EU is particularly at risk of a carbon bubble.
委员会不可避免的要分析不同指标之间的相关性 - - 从而，从政治上来讲，不合法的干涉了某国的决策进程。	Inevitably, the Commission would have to decide the relevance of the different indicators - thus intervening in the national policymaking process with no political legitimacy.
推动过去十年中国经济增长的引擎 — — 大量廉价劳动力、进口技术和大规模实体投资 — — 正在失去动力。	The engines that have propelled China’s growth over the last few decades – a huge supply of cheap labor, imported technology, and massive physical investment – are petering out.
阿拉伯世界的人民起义进程体现出民主是否能实现，与两大关键内部因素紧密相连：国家安全力量所扮演的角色，以及国家镇压能力的技术含量。	The popular upsurge in the Arab world shows that democratic empowerment hinges on two key internal factors: the role of security forces and the technological sophistication of the state’s repressive capacity.
国际社会现行的流离失所政策主要依靠人道主义援助，其宗旨是在寻求永久解决方案的过程中提供快速赈济物资以挽救生命。	The international community’s current approach to displacement relies mainly on humanitarian aid, which provides rapid, lifesaving relief while the search for a permanent solution is underway.
我们充当了一座连接非正式储蓄组织与银行、医疗中心、学校和农技服务之间的桥梁，帮助妇女做出有关粮食使用、营养和支出的更好的决策。	By serving as a bridge between informal savings groups and banks, health centers, schools, and agricultural extension services, we are helping women make better decisions about food use, nutritional practices, and spending.
20年前，国际扶轮社领导的草根运动决定行动。 该社为志愿性组织，在200多个国家拥有大约120万会员。	Twenty years ago, a grass-roots movement led by Rotary International, a voluntary organization with around 1.2 million members in more than 200 countries, decided to attack.
纽约—两年前，安倍晋三当选为日本首相，启动了被称为“安倍经济学”的三管齐下计划，试图让日本经济走出滞涨和通缩困局。	NEW YORK – Two years ago, Shinzo Abe’s election as Japan’s prime minister led to the advent of “Abenomics,” a three-part plan to rescue the economy from a treadmill of stagnation and deflation.
比方说，在1990到2010年间年均降低5.6%之后，叙利亚的婴儿死亡率近年来已经增长了9.3 % 。	For example, after declining at an average annual rate of 5.6% between 1990 and 2010, Syria’s infant mortality rate has risen by 9.3% in recent years.
在当今各领域之间互相关联的世界里，任何身份不明的对非政府基础设施所进行的网络攻击都可能会带来严重的灾害。	In today’s interconnected world, an unidentified cyber attack on non-governmental infrastructure might be severely damaging.
来自海湾国家的汇款将会减少，外包业务会遇到挫折，但是基础设施投资却很有希望，印度在这方面一直欠债，它希望继续这方面的高速增长。	Remittances from the Gulf States will suffer and its outsourcing business will languish, but hopefully infrastructure investments, of which India has a great backlog, will continue apace.
也许最严重的指控针对的是孟加拉国反对派领导人齐亚（Khaleda Zia ） 。 他被指控一宗多年前的谋杀。	Perhaps the gravest allegations have been leveled at Bangladesh’s opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who has been charged with murder in a case going back many years.
在日本，即将出任首相的安倍晋三也释放出同样的信号，尽管他准备为日本银行设定一个“最低”通胀目标，而不是与通胀或就业挂钩。	In Japan, Shinzo Abe, the incoming prime minister, is signaling the same set of concerns, although he seems to be proposing a “minimum” inflation target for the Bank of Japan, rather than a link to growth or employment.
这种观点源自日本令人印象深刻的战后经济增长；如今，经过二十多年的经济不景气，当年的推断只能提醒我们线性预测是危险的。	Such views extrapolated from Japan’s impressive postwar economic growth; today, after more than two decades of malaise, they simply remind us of the danger of linear projections.
在国家和市场之间建立的新平衡开创了发达国家前所未有的社会凝聚、稳定以及繁荣时期。 这一时期一直持续到七十年代中期。	The new balance that it established between state and market set the stage for an unprecedented period of social cohesion, stability, and prosperity in the advanced economies that lasted until the mid-1970’s.
此外，意大利决策者应该努力提高女性劳动力参与率 — — 目前为49 % ， 也处于经合组织的最低水平。	Moreover, Italian policymakers should strive to boost the female labor-force participation rate, which, at 49%, is one of the lowest in the OECD.
美国当前的保障项目 — — 如医疗补助，失业补偿，营养补充援助计划和有需要家庭临时援助 — — 也应该加大力度。	In the US, current programs – such as Medicaid, unemployment compensation, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) – should be made more generous.
另一个颇有意思的地方是看默克尔如何处理德国陷入乱象的能源转型，即向低碳经济的转变，这是她任上最重要的国内工程。	It will also be interesting to see if and how Merkel tackles Germany’s muddled Energiewende (energy turnaround) – the move to a low-carbon economy that is the most important domestic project of her tenure.
毕竟，如果营养充分的母亲可以为她的孩子们提供关键的终身健康益处，那么女性就可以称为后代健康的看门人。	After all, if an adequately nourished mother provides critical health benefits to her offspring throughout their lives, women can be viewed as the custodians of future generations’ health.
此外，脱欧公投不会改变北约的战略重要性，维持合作非常必要，而且欧盟需要英国的程度并不亚于英国需要欧盟。	Moreover, the Brexit vote does not change the strategic importance of NATO, where continued cooperation is necessary and where the EU needs the UK as much as the UK needs the EU.
最后，身为依赖大宗商品进口的重要自然资源净进口国，印度需要开放、竞争、充满活力的国际贸易和金融体系。	Finally, as a country that does not export vital natural resources and is dependent on substantial commodity imports, India needs an open, competitive, vibrant system of international trade and finance.
达卡 -正如人们对穆斯林世界的伊斯兰政治的担心日益加剧之时，有着世界第四大穆斯林人口（ 一亿二千六百万人口）的孟加拉国，却已朝着相反的方向戏剧性地前进了。	DAKKA – As fears about the Islamization of politics in the Muslim world grow, Bangladesh, with the world’s fourth-largest Muslim population (126 million), has moved dramatically in the opposite direction.
值得注意的是，日本人在过去二十年中把这一政策建议的内容试了个遍：他们把利率维持在低位、引入量化宽松，还启动了大量债务融资的基础设施支出。	It is worth noting that the Japanese checked each of these boxes over the last two decades: They held interest rates low, introduced quantitative easing, and launched massive debt-financed spending on infrastructure.
当他的婚外情曝光时，他面对的是自己的失败，承担此时的后果，做出了在他看来责任、荣誉和国家信条要求他做出的反应。	When his affair came to light, he faced up to his failure, took responsibility for the consequences, and did what he believed that duty, honor, and country required.
就像正在进行的医疗辩论探讨在降低成本的同时改善效益一样，我们应当发起探讨暴力预防及恢复计划成本效益的公众辩论。	Just as the ongoing health-care debate focuses on reducing costs while improving outcomes, a public debate centered on the costs and effectiveness of violence prevention and recovery programs should be launched.
但尽管可以找到诸多理由指责外国势力应当对该地区的危险状态负责，但责怪别人 — — 甚或相互责怪 — — 却什么问题也解决不了。	But while there are many reasons to blame foreign powers for the region’s parlous state of affairs, blaming others – or even one another – will solve nothing.
事实上，去年12月，普京在访问Khmeimim俄罗斯空军基地时宣布撤军，原因正是干预目标已经正式达成。	In fact, last December, on a visit to the Russian airbase in Khmeimim, Putin announced the withdrawal of troops, precisely because that objective had officially been achieved.
考虑到中国经济已经抵达结构转型的关键门槛 — — 期待已久的向服务领导型增长动态转变，这一点尤其重要。	This is particularly relevant in light of the important threshold that has now been reached by the structural transformation of the Chinese economy – the long-awaited shift to a services-led growth dynamic.
十二个月后，中国和美国卷入了一场无法结束的贸易战，特朗普用“战略竞争”代替了美国以前的“战略合作”的对华政策。	Twelve months later, China and the United States are caught in an unresolved trade war, and Trump’s administration has replaced US “strategic engagement” with China with “strategic competition.”
就连“金砖”一词的创造者奥尼尔（Jim O’Neill）也将注意力转向了“薄荷 ” （ MINT）经济体 — — 墨西哥、印度尼西亚、尼日利亚和土耳其 — — 它们都是金砖国家主要的新兴国家竞争对手。	Even Jim O’Neill, who coined the term “BRIC,” has turned his attention to the “MINT” economies – Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey – the BRICS’ key emerging-country competitors.
事实上，到2011年，前诺基亚员工创建了220家类似企业，打造出狂卖1,200万份的智能手机游戏“愤怒的小鸟”的Rovio公司就有大量前诺基亚员工。	Indeed, by 2011, former Nokia staff had created 220 such businesses, and Rovio, which has sold more than 12 million copies of its smartphone-based video game, “Angry Birds,” is crowded with former Nokia employees.
但大量实证研究证实，在宏观层面，商业投资主要取决于预期未来需求和产出增长，而不是当前回报率或留存利润。	But extensive empirical research confirms that at the macro level, business investment depends primarily on expected future demand and output growth, not on current returns or retained earnings.
它生活在恐惧之中，数百万人被恣意妄为、精神错乱的美国军事机器投入战争漩涡，数十亿人生活在核灭绝的阴影之下。	It is living in dread, with millions pushed into the vortex of war by an unrestrained and unhinged US military machine, and with billions living in the shadow of nuclear annihilation.
正如国际货币基金组织警告的那样 ： “ 排除商品之外的核心通胀率已经从2%增加到3.75 % ， 意味着通胀的影响正不断扩大 。 ”	As the IMF cautions, “core inflation – excluding commodities – has risen from 2% to 3.75%, suggesting that inflation is broadening.”
这表明“德尼索瓦人”一定不仅仅存在于西伯利亚，也存在于东南亚路径上，早期现代人经此路径抵达假想的杂交发生地 — — 澳大拉西亚。	This indicates that the “Denisovans” must have existed not just in Siberia, but also along the southeast Asian route that early modern humans used to reach Australasia, where the hypothesized hybridization occurred.
对于特朗普及其团队愈演愈烈的违反道德的行为，人们已经做出了反击 — — 或至少是突出他们的所作所为。	Efforts have been made to counter – or, at least, highlight – the ethics violations that Trump and his team are accumulating.
他们的说法是，只要他们有权投票，穆斯林传统主义者宁可把票投给有天主教根基的保守派，也不会支持那些被看作鼓吹放荡行为的世俗的左翼党派。	Where they can vote, so the argument goes, Muslim traditionalists would rather vote for a conservative party, even if it has Catholic roots, than for a secular left-wing party perceived as advocating loose morals.
我们就有一个，这也是为什么我今年10月在中国批准了中国投资者和英国电网（EDF Energy）的交易，共同建设英国未来30年内的第一个核反应堆。	We do, which is why I was in China in October agreeing a deal between Chinese investors and EDF Energy to build the first reactor in the UK for a generation.
"只要人们还披着相对""无知的面纱 "" ， 即当人们还不了解作为个人会受到怎样的影响，他们就可能更易于赞同采用累进税制以补贴低收入者。"	"As long as people remain under a relative ""veil of ignorance,"" in the sense that they do not yet know how they will personally be affected, they may find it easier to agree that progressive taxes should be used to subsidize low-wage earners."
换言之，虽然新兴市场国家 — — 由于其对资本流的依赖 — — 会在美国货币政策逐渐恢复“常态”后面临风险，但发达国家也不太可能置身事外。	In other words, though emerging markets – through their dependence on capital inflows – will be at risk when America’s monetary policy eventually returns to “normal,” the same will be true for advanced economies.
在这方面，自由或社会民主与强硬空想家 — — 不管是民族主义者还是其他 — — 的世界观的根本性区别也许是最为重要的。	Here, the fundamental difference in the worldview of liberal or social democrats and hardline ideologues, whether nationalist or otherwise, may be the most consequential.
1990年代推动高度全球化的努力在那些从全球经济中获利并分享价值的人与那些未能分享价值的人之间形成了深刻的分歧。	The push for hyper-globalization in the 1990s has created a deep division between those who prosper in the global economy and share its values, and those who do not.
而特朗普的反对者则认为非法移民本身往往是严重犯罪的受害者或证人，但由于害怕被驱逐出境所以不愿去警局配合调查。	Trump’s opponents argue that illegal immigrants themselves are often victims of – or witnesses to – serious crimes, but are reluctant to go to the police because they fear deportation.
20世纪70年代以来各种不平等性指标的上升更多地与劳动力内部比例变化（不同赚得收入类别之间）而不是财富有关。	The increases in various measures of inequality since the 1970s have had more to do with shifts within labor’s share (between different categories of earned income) than with wealth.
正是这一需要决定了即将作出的裁决的重要性，因为它为法院提供了一个时机来重申确定我们民主社会的非歧视的基本原则。	It is this imperative that underlies the importance of the coming decision, for it provides an occasion for the Court to reassert the fundamental principle of non-discrimination that defines our democratic societies.
这里有一个标准的经济模型：德国劳动力市场政策，瑞典的退休金，法国的低碳能源，加拿大的医疗保健，瑞士的能源效率，美国的科学好奇心，巴西的扶贫项目以及哥斯达黎加的热带幸福感。	So here is one model economy: German labor-market policies, Swedish pensions, French low-carbon energy, Canadian health care, Swiss energy efficiency, American scientific curiosity, Brazilian anti-poverty programs, and Costa Rican tropical happiness.
lamp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 印度的德里市正在推出新的生态友好的压缩天然气汽车，它将额外创造18000个新岗位。	·The Indian city of Delhi is introducing new eco-friendly compressed natural gas buses, which will create an additional 18,000 new jobs.
经济学家斯特凡·卡瓦莱克（Stefan Kawalec）将当前欧元区政策组合直接称为“货币操纵 ” 。	The economist Stefan Kawalec has explicitly referred to the current policy mix in the eurozone as “currency manipulation.”
但相对于发达国家所面对的债务，或者许多发展中经济体的基础设施和教育缺口来说，这一缓慢进展只能算是一个次要的发展障碍。	But slow progress is a far less important challenge to growth prospects than the debt overhang in developed economies, or infrastructure and educational deficiencies in many developing economies.
土耳其比俄罗斯更具动感和活力，其经济境况与俄罗斯相比无疑也有很大优势，但两国政府都过高估计了自己的实力，而低估了向专制转向的代价。	Turkey is more dynamic and energetic than Russia, and its economy certainly is faring much better, but both regimes are overestimating the strength of their position and underestimating the cost of their autocratic turn.
在贸易领域，特朗普希望减少中国对美国的出口，最大可能是通过对中国产品强征更多关税并施压美国和国际制造企业将他们的生产设施迁到美国。	On trade, Trump wants to curtail Chinese exports to the US, presumably by imposing higher tariffs on Chinese goods and pressuring US and international manufacturers to move their production facilities to America.
今年某些时候，美国国会可能对布什总统在三月访问新德里期间签署的“美国和印度民用核子合作倡议”进行投票。	Sometime this year, the United States Congress is likely to vote on the “US-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative,” signed when President Bush visited New Delhi in March.
但成功概率哪怕只是微小增加，如果这意味着带来两家 — — 而不是一家或一家都没有 — — 苹果或三星，也已经是善莫大焉。	But even a modest improvement in odds will deliver outsize results if it means landing two Apples or Samsungs rather than one – or none.
在逊尼派当中，对伊斯兰国家支持率的下降最为明显。 这对于宗教极端主义分子在该族群中招募人员的能力会产生重大影响。	Among Sunnis, the decline in support for an Islamic state is most dramatic, and may have significant ramifications for the ability of religious extremists to recruit among them.
他以为他—和财政部长保罗•奥尼尔—能够通过兵不血刃的“内部博弈”赢得理智的政策而不用诉诸可能会使他2004年连任失败的“外部博弈 ” 。	He thought that he – and Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill – could win the quiet “inside game” for sensible policy without resorting to an “outside game” that would make his reappointment in 2004 unlikely.
设计正确的灌溉系统、大坝和堤岸 — — 更不用说在最有利于降低气候变化影响的地方建设这些设施 — — 也需要准确的数据。	Accurate data are also needed to design the right irrigation systems, dams, and embankments – not to mention building them where they will have the greatest impact in terms of mitigating the effects of climate change.
但直到董建华试图实施严苛的内部安全立法，许多香港人才开始感到他们被压迫性政府接管了，而此前他们认为自己可以免受此待遇。	But it was not until Tung tried to ram through draconian internal-security legislation that many of Hong Kong’s citizens began to feel that they were being overtaken by the repressive governance from which they were supposed to be exempt.
据国际能源署的数据，目前全球能源供给投资总量为每年1.6万亿美元，其中70%仍基于石油、煤炭或天然气。	According to the International Energy Agency, global investment in energy supply currently amounts to $1.6 trillion annually, and 70% of it is still based on oil, coal, or gas.
他们不仅忠诚于选他们做领导人的公民，也忠诚于经受了法德仇恨后果的先人和将从妥协中获益的尚未来到世上的后代。	Their loyalty was not only to the citizens who elected them, but also to the generations of the past that had endured the consequences of Franco-German enmity, and to generations yet to come, which would benefit from reconciliation.
就算不是大多数，也有许多学生入读的原因不再是因为他们“相信”欧洲，而是因为他们对自己在各自国家找工作的能力缺乏信心。	Many students, if not the majority, are no longer on campus because they “believe” in Europe, but because they are full of doubts as to their capacity to find a job in their respective countries.
如果局势发展真如人们所料般由莫卡斯当选总统，他的执政日程应当明智而慎重，既不会虚度光阴无所事事，也不会因为采取过激的改革措施而无法正常运作。	If, as appears increasingly likely, Mockus becomes president, his agenda promises to be prudent – neither a leap into the void nor immobilized by the need for profound changes.
在2004到2006年之间，非常认同“让宗教领袖拥有绝对权威的伊斯兰政府”的观点的伊拉克人数从30%下降到22 % 。	Between 2004 and 2006, the number of Iraqis who said it was “very good to have an Islamic government where religious leaders have absolute power” fell from 30% to 22%.
其后一个月访问莫斯科时，国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森也效法了这样的策略，他不顾美国国会的敦促，避免国务院与民间社会活动家进行公开会面。	On his visit to Moscow the following month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson mirrored this approach, eschewing the State Department tradition of meeting publicly with civil-society activists, despite urging from the US Congress.
俄罗斯在Abkhazia和南奥塞梯（格鲁吉亚的另一个企图分裂的地区）的所谓“维和部队”实际上一直在保护叛乱政府。	Russia’s supposed “peacekeeping troops” in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia’s other secession-minded region, have in fact protected their rebel governments.
因此，拉美的公有和私有制企业都应该立刻根据这一新型竞争关系采取相关措施，以应对与中国企业的合作性项目。	Both the public and private sector throughout the region should take immediate measures to face up to this new competition and to work toward cooperative projects with the Chinese.
是气候变化引起了更深、更频繁的干旱，由此造成的水短缺需要可能相当困难的新解决方案，光是抚慰公众是不够的。	As climate change leads to deeper and more frequent droughts, the resulting water shortages will require new, sometimes difficult, solutions that go beyond futile attempts to placate the public.
他们得出了如下一组数字，即每个美国人使用的地球面积是九点四公顷，每个欧洲人是四点七公顷，那些在低收入国家每人只用了一公顷。	Their numbers show that each American uses 9.4 hectares of the globe, each European 4.7 hectares, and those in low-income countries just one hectare.
赞助支持的增加值得欢迎，主要包括全球抗艾滋病、结核病和疟疾基金提供1亿美元资金支持的地区青蒿素抗药性项目。	There has been a welcome increase in donor support, notably the Regional Artemisinin-resistance Initiative, funded by a $100-million grant from The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
但是这确实意味着一个纽约人应该认识到他可能对一个内罗毕人所拥有的所有优势只不过是出生的偶然性所造成的，而不是因为他有什么功德。	But it does mean that a New Yorker should recognize that any advantages he may have over a Nairobian are due to an accident of birth rather than merit.
这意味着近几年来一直在出售俄罗斯资产、投资于西方国家（想必至少部分是因为制裁）的许多俄罗斯富豪不属于此列。	That means potentially giving a pass to the many wealthy Russians who in recent years have been selling off parts of their holdings in Russia and investing in Western countries (presumably at least partly owing to sanctions).
下个月，萨蒂亚尔希和女孩权利领袖马拉拉·尤沙夫赛（Malala Yousafzai）将领取今年的诺贝尔和平奖，他们的获奖提醒世界，儿童权利斗争仍在进行中，并且日益由年轻人所领导。	Next month, Satyarthi and the girls’-rights leader Malala Yousafzai will receive this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, reminding the world that a children’s-rights struggle is underway – one that is increasingly being led by young people.
都已经是21世纪了，我们都把人送上月球再接回来了，却还没有能力让地球上的所有人都吃饱肚子，这怎么可以？	How can it be that in the twenty-first century, when we have taken men to the Moon and back, we still cannot feed everyone on this planet?
此外，在私人部门确实起着关键作用的领域 — — 疫苗研发，也找不到激励促使资源用于影响穷人或穷国的疾病。	Moreover, where the private sector does play an essential role – vaccine development – it has little incentive to devote resources to diseases that afflict the poor or poor countries.
把抗抑郁药作为防止重犯主要方法的困难在于：很多人不愿意无限期地服用抗抑郁药，而一旦停止服药，又将再次面临着抑郁的危险。	The problem with viewing antidepressants as the main method for preventing recurrence is that many people do not want to stay on medication for indefinite periods, and when the medication stops, the risk of becoming depressed again returns.
但是，齐普拉斯和他的左翼联盟党（Syriza）执政已经六个月，却仍没有看清金融现实，无法借助他人的角度看待问题。	Tsipras and his Syriza party, however, spent their first six months in office still blinkered about financial realities, unable to see things from the perspective of others.
在外国资本大量流入的情况下，对可贸易商品的私人投资水平停滞不前是一个非常有力的危险信号，任政府说的如何天花乱坠都不能忽视。	In the midst of a foreign-capital bonanza, stagnant levels of private investment in tradable goods are a particularly powerful danger signal that no amount of government mythmaking should be allowed to override.
在欧洲，疯牛病之所以让许多人震惊，不仅仅是因为它打破了牛肉作为一种安全健康食品的形象，而且因为人们知道了这种病的根源是给牛饲喂羊的脑浆和神经组织。	In Europe, mad cow disease shocked many people, not only because it shattered beef’s image as a safe and healthy food, but also because they learned that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep.
这是一个重大差别，特别是考虑到中国人均GDP只有日本最高峰水平的19 % ， 而其债务已经达到日本的60 % 。	This is a substantial difference, especially considering that China’s per capita GDP amounts to only 19% of Japan’s at its highest level, and that its debt has already reached 60% of Japan’s.
新胜选总统安德烈斯·曼努埃尔·洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔（Andrés Manuel López Obrador）即将上任的政府可以去解决犯罪不罚的问题，但前提是要给检察官办公室拨付充足的资源。	The incoming government of President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador can tackle the impunity problem, but only if FEADLE is fully resourced.
人们或许预计美联储主席 — — 可以说是美国权力第二大的行政职位，当然也是全世界最具权威的金融宝座 — — 会由中央银行家组成的小团体来决定。	One might expect the Fed chairmanship – arguably the second most powerful official position in the United States, and certainly the world’s most powerful financial position – to be determined by a conclave of central bankers.
贸易谈判发展回合行将失败以及联合国安理会迟迟未能要求在黎巴嫩实现停火只不过是美国对多边倡议的轻视的最新例子而已。	The looming failure of the Development Round of trade talks and the long delay in the United Nations Security Council’s demand for a ceasefire in Lebanon are but the latest examples of America’s contempt for multilateral initiatives.
联合国秘书长的工作几乎没有什么硬实力及，但是有些人以巨大的努力来担当这份工作，运用他们的软实力资源来借助各国的硬实力。	The job of UN Secretary General involves very little hard power, but some people have filled the post with great effect, using their soft power resources to leverage the hard power of governments.
关注从国际高级代表办公室(OHR) 到以欧盟为中心的使团这一仍不明确的 “过渡”的欧盟，似乎决定在其了解促使波斯尼亚过渡所需的工具之前，清空其工具箱。	The EU, fixated on a still undefined ampquot;transitionampquot; from OHR to an EU-centered mission, seems intent on emptying its toolbox before it knows what tools it will need to enable Bosnia's transition.
一些国家也许足够大、足够强，能够怙恶不悛而逍遥法外，但用好行为赢得尊重是远远更强大的经济和政治成功基础。	Some states may be big and powerful enough to get away with behaving badly, but winning respect for behaving well is a much stronger foundation for economic and political success.
2008年金融危机以来，随着中国在世界经济中的经济实力和影响，出现了一种新观点：中国和美国应该被称为“G2 ” ， 共同领导整个世界。	As China’s economic power and influence in the world economy have increased following the financial crisis of 2008, the idea has been floated that China and the United States should co-lead the world under some sort of “G-2” arrangement.
虽然对于中国这个如一个大陆般巨大的国家来说，其所采取的政策带来了皮诺切特式的经济发展奇迹，但他们同时也剥夺了所有人的自由，甚至连人口占绝大多数的汉族人也不能幸免。	Though China’s policies have brought about Pinochet-style economic growth, if on the scale of a country that is almost a continent unto itself, they have also ensured that there is in no freedom for anyone, including the Han majority.
在这种情况下，美国的增长引擎可能熄火，殃及整个全球经济，尤其是当这些经济挑战促使特朗普政府实施保护主义措施的时候。	In such a scenario, the US engine could sputter, causing the entire global economy to suffer, especially if these economic challenges prompt the Trump administration to implement protectionist measures.
现在，密松事件和湄公河事件给这些项目蒙上了一层阴影，激发了人们对产生连锁反应的担忧 — — 中国20年来促进地区一体化的努力可能因此付诸东流。	The Myitsone and Mekong incidents have now cast a shadow over these projects, fueling fear of a chain reaction that could wreck China’s two-decade-long effort to achieve deeper regional integration.
不平等的贸易协议 — — 包括保留减少了许多穷困国家赖以生存的收入的不正当农业补贴 — — 发挥了影响。	Here, unfair trade agreements – including the persistence of unjustifiable agricultural subsidies, which depress the prices upon which the income of many of the poorest depend – have played a role.
与此同时，如果由欧元区提供的第一损失缓冲告罄，IMF的资本资源将继续支持NAV；这样一来，市场就会明白，欧元区以外的力量也能够被调动起来。	At the same time, the Fund’s capital resources would back the vehicle if the first-loss buffer provided by the eurozone were eroded; that way, the market would understand that strength from outside the eurozone can be brought to bear.
低速运行进一步加剧了低效，开行速度很少超过每小时50公里（货车的开行速度为每小时30公里 ） ， 部分原因是为了安抚各派政治利益而导致停靠的车站数量越来越多。	Exacerbating this inefficiency are slow train speeds, which rarely exceed 50 kilometers per hours (and 30 kilometers per hour for freight), partly owing to the need to stop at an ever-rising number of stations to appease political interests.
2011年的人口普查显示，印度的男女童比例已经从每千名男性927名女性下降到每千名男性914名女性，创下六十年来的新低。	According to the 2011 census, the sex ratio of the country’s children has dipped from 927 females per 1000 males to 914, a 60-year low.
事情发生的地点是马孔多这个虚构的小镇，但鲜有读者因此而受骗：这部小说写的是加西亚·马尔克斯的祖国哥伦比亚。	The site of the event is the fictional town of Macondo, but few readers are fooled: the novel is about García Márquez’s native Colombia.
突尼斯和乌克兰同样面临战争的严重破坏（突尼斯所受的战争破坏来自利比亚 ） ， 包括大量流离失所人口的涌入（大约有200万难民涌入上述两国 ） 。	And both have faced serious disruptions from war (in Tunisia’s case, in Libya), including an influx of displaced people (each country is home to around two million refugees).
2006年9月，布什总统和胡锦涛主席确认美中经济关系的重要性和复杂性，并且在两国之间建立了“战略经济对话”制度。	In recognition of the importance and complexity of the US-China economic relationship, in September 2006 President George W. Bush and President Hu Jintao created the “Strategic Economic Dialogue” between our countries.
预期的市场回报率是这一数值加上或减去预期的估值比变化：股票收益会随着市盈率提升而增加，抑或随着市盈率降低而减少？	The expected market return is that amount plus or minus expected changes in valuation ratios: will stocks return more as price-earnings ratios rise, or return less as price-earnings ratios fall?
因为，85%的选民前往投票，这是自1965年戴高乐将军最后一次竞选总统以来法国总统选举中最高的参与程度。	For 85% of the electorate went to vote in what has been the highest level of participation in presidential elections in France since Charles de Gaulle last ran for president in1965.
这个2.38亿美元的重建计划占地250公顷，风格现代，令人炫目，拥有蜿蜒的游步道、美轮美奂的海滨度假村、值得你拍照发“朋友圈”的公园和广场、生态走廊，还有会议中心。	The $328 million plan, covering 250-hectares, is modern and glitzy, with sprawling walkways, grandiose waterfront resorts, Instagram-worthy parks and plazas, an eco-trail, and a convention hall.
只要具体的人群愿意放弃脱离主义政治，接受哈贝马斯所谓的“宪政爱国主义 ” ， 政治决策就可以是分散的。	So long as particular groups are willing to abandon the politics of secession and embrace what Habermas calls “constitutional patriotism,” political decision-making can be decentralized.
但每个岗位的成本都很高：所有进口品都将变得更加昂贵，并且这一价格水平的升高将渗透到美国人所购买的一切东西。	But the cost per job will be high: all imports will become more expensive, and this increase in the price level will filter through to the cost of everything Americans buy.
比如，在肯尼亚，一家私人公司开发了一套移动支付系统，该系统允许用户使用手机转账，事实上创造了远比政府所能提供的更快捷的银行系统。	For example, in Kenya, a private company developed a mobile-payments system that allows users to transfer money using cell phones, effectively creating a banking system much more quickly than the government could have done.
瑞典和德国接纳了大部分来自叙利亚和其他地方的寻求庇护者，而其他大部分欧盟成员国只接纳了极少数或一个人都没有接纳。	Sweden and Germany have taken in the majority of asylum seekers from Syria and elsewhere, while most other EU member states have admitted few or none.
事实上，作为《中国2030 》 （ China 2030，世界银行和中国高级智库国务院发展研究中心共同起草的最新特别联合报告）的主管，他对中国必须采用何种路线胸有成竹。	Indeed, having overseen China 2030 – an extraordinary joint report recently produced by the World Bank and China’s own high-level think tank, the Development Research Center – he has a deep understanding of the roadmap that China must embrace.
但是，与允许个人向全世界提供家具（furniture）不同，众筹是为了快速筹集资金，出资者都是内行，而筹资项目未必为银行家所理解。	But, unlike allowing individuals to offer their furniture to the whole world, crowdfunding is supposed to raise money fast, from those in the know, for businesses that bankers might not understand.
而如果真正的投资所得实际上要比报告数字大一倍，那么真正的美国经常项目余额在2009年就不再是赤字，并在此后一直是盈余。	And if true investment income is indeed as large as double what is reported, the true US current-account balance entered the black in 2009 and has been in surplus ever since.
我们可能无法忘记在过去60年中困扰伊朗对美国政府看法的不信任和怀疑，但如今我们必须专注于现在，着眼于将来。	While we may not be able to forget the mistrust and suspicion that have haunted Iranians’ thinking about US governments for the last 60 years, now we must focus on the present and look to the future.
从这一点来说，奥威尔（George Orwell）的《1984》大错特错了，因为现代技术的标志绝非老大哥（Big Brother ） ， 而是分散化。	George Orwell’s vision of 1984 could hardly have been more wrong, because the hallmark of modern technology is not Big Brother, but decentralization.
尽管他是完美的政客，并且显然被其所在政党的许多活跃分子所挂念，但其他法国选民反对他的立场更加鲜明 — — 原因大多数出于个人问题，并且没有理由改变立场。	Though he is a consummate politician who is clearly missed by many of his party’s activists, the rest of France’s voters have even more clearly rejected him, mostly over issues of personality, and see no reason to modify their stance.
也正是戈尔巴乔夫宣布苏联军队不会干涉风雨飘摇的东德政府尊从其人民的意愿 — — 这堪称是一项对东德至关重要的声明。	And it was Gorbachev who proclaimed that Soviet forces would not intervene to support troubled communist regimes against the will of their people – a declaration aimed directly at East Germany.
在政治界，明年大选即将到来之际，取代81岁的现任总理辛格的最有力候选人是来自印度人民党的62岁的莫迪（Narendra Modi）和年仅43岁的甘地（Rahul Gandhi ） 。	In politics, as the country prepares for next year’s general election, the leading contenders to replace 81-year-old Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Narendra Modi, 62, and Rahul Gandhi, who is just 43.
想想今年总值4万亿美元的并购吧。 各个公司收购并剥离分支或部门希望获得协同效应、市场实力或是更好的管理。	Consider the $4 trillion of mergers and acquisitions this year, as companies acquire and spin off branches and divisions in the hope of gaining synergies or market power or better management.
为控制极端主义内容，YouTube 删除了数百条与冲突相关的视频，许多由记录这场灾难的独立新闻渠道 — — Shaam新闻网、Qasioun通讯社和伊德利卜媒体中心所发布的视频也包括在内。	In an effort to rein in extremist content, YouTube removed hundreds of videos related to the conflict, including many posted by Shaam News Network, Qasioun News Agency, and Idlib Media Center – all independent news outlets documenting the disaster.
可以理解，许多领导人（最著名的是德国总理安吉拉·默克尔）担心广泛的宏观经济刺激的长期后果。 这些担心是有根据的。	A number of leaders, most prominently German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are understandably worried about the longer-term consequences of aggressive macroeconomic stimulus.
当我询问郭国际社会能为让推特在中国普及做些什么时，他回答说我们可以“提供价格便宜的虚拟专用网络 。 ”	When I asked Guo how the outside world could make Twitter more accessible in China, he replied that we could help by “providing affordable VPN service.”
在长达30年的凯恩斯时代，资本主义国家的政府管理和调控期经济，并以此来维持充分的就业和缓和经济的周期性波动。	During the three-decade-long Keynesian era, governments in the capitalist world managed and regulated their economies to maintain full employment and moderate business fluctuations.
我们致力于营造一种环境，让农村贫困男女可以种植和出售更多的粮食，增加他们的收入并决定自己生活的方向。	We work to create conditions in which poor rural women and men can grow and sell more food, increase their incomes, and determine the direction of their own lives.
欧盟很早就采取了这一治理机制，而即便在东盟内部，也有多数投票决策的先例，特别是在地缘政治和安全问题上。	The European Union embraced this governance mechanism long ago, and even within ASEAN there is precedent for majority-vote decision-making, particularly on geopolitical and security issues.
在美国电台的脱口秀和福克斯电视的鼓噪下，典型的民粹主义者展开了自身的宣传攻势，欧洲的代表人物就是怀尔德斯。	This is a common form of populist paranoia, promoted in the US by radio talk-show hosts and Fox television, and in Europe by men like Wilders.
发自北京 — — 美国的立法者已经制定了一项新法案，该法案一旦颁布，就将创建一个新的开发融资机构来取代原有的海外私人投资公司（Overseas Private Investment Corporation ） 。	BEIJING – Lawmakers in the United States have introduced legislation that, if enacted, would create a new development finance institution (DFI) to replace the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
完全没有任何指标去衡量一个项目是否向公民实际提供了意向商品或服务，如果答案是否定的，也没有任何机制追偿。	Missing is any measure of whether a project is actually providing the intended goods or services to citizens, and any mechanism for recourse if it is not.
华沙 — — 10月19日下午晚些时候，一名54岁的男子在华沙科学文化宫外散发了几十份写给波兰民众的公开信。	WARSAW – Late in the afternoon on October 19, a 54-year-old man outside the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw distributed several dozen copies of a letter addressed to the Polish people.
实际上，他在成立自己的新政党“巴基斯坦穆斯林全联盟”时的演讲中也承认了这一点。 他宣布成立新政党的地点十分安全，距离愈加动荡的巴基斯坦有着千里之遥。	The judge had refused to be directed by the president and the military in deciding important constitutional matters, including Musharraf’s own eligibility to contest the presidency while still in uniform.
最令人心碎的体验之一是看到年轻人因为没有工作而无所事事，即便他们已经接受了中等和高等教育，或者因为他们的健康遭到了破坏。	One of the most devastating experiences is to see youth wasting away because they are unemployed, even after they have completed secondary and tertiary education, or because their health has deteriorated.
在该指数垫底的国家 — — 索马里、民主刚果和中非共和国 — — 法治精神仍是一个神话，有待走进现实。	For those at the bottom – Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic – the rule of law is a fiction that must be made real.
首脑会晤期间，特朗普政府很有可能提出签署结束1950到1953年朝鲜战争并承认朝鲜合法地位的和平协定。	At the summit, the Trump administration will likely hold out the prospect of a peace agreement to end the 1950-1953 Korean War and recognize the North Korean state.
毫无疑问，由于贸易、旅行和通讯，更不用说多边合作结构和国际金融流，各国在经济和社会上的变得更加相互依存。	Countries have undoubtedly become more economically and socially interdependent, owing to trade, travel, and telecommunications, not to mention multinational corporate structures and international financial flows.
这一对科学权威性的滥用在“有机”和“自然”食品行业尤其普遍，这些行业利用人们对合成或“非自然”产品的恐慌心理。	This abuse of scientific authority is especially widespread in the “organic” and “natural” food industries, which capitalize on people’s fear of synthetic or “unnatural” products.
市场本身既不有效也不稳定，但是撤销管制的政治行为为前所未有的过剩留出了余地，从而引起资产泡沫和泡沫破裂后的滚动危机。	Markets on their own may be neither efficient nor stable, but the politics of deregulation gave scope to unprecedented excesses that led to asset bubbles and the rolling crisis that has followed their collapse.
国际货币基金组织若成为国际收支不平衡和全球金融市场风险源头可靠的、公平的裁判，这个运作形式就需要进行改革，从而赋予国际货币基金组织必需的独立性。	This modus operandi needs to be changed in order to give the IMF the independence it needs if it is to become a credible, impartial judge of balance-of-payments disequilibria and sources of risk to global financial markets.
具体而言，各国政府，特别是那些正在无休止地增加美元储备的政府是否应该转而考虑如何修建道路、桥梁、港口、电网和其他基础设施了？	In particular, should governments, especially those that are endlessly building up dollar reserves, instead start thinking about how to build up their roads, bridges, ports, electric grids, and other infrastructure?
对德国来说，紧缩 — — 表现为持续的工资和收入抑制 — — 是该国于2006年完成的增长导向改革的重要组成部分。	For Germans, austerity, in the form of sustained wage and income restraint, was an important part of the growth-oriented reforms that their country completed in 2006.
比如，欧盟最近宣布了一项耗资36亿欧元的纳米技术研究项目，包括与这些挑战相关的环境、健康和安全目标。	For example, the European Union has recently announced a €3.6 billion nanotechnology research program, which includes environment, health, and safety goals that align with these challenges.
但利率不可能比今天的水平再低多少了；事实上，预计利率将出现上升，特别是在美国，而欧洲央行和其他主要央行也可能即将进入紧缩周期。	But interest rates can’t go much lower than they are today; in fact, they are expected to rise, particularly in the US, though the European Central Bank and other major central banks also appear to be entering a tightening cycle.
如果我们失去了信心，那么首先是那些最大和最强的国家，其次是中欧所有的国家，都将弃欧洲大同之梦于不顾。	If not, then first the biggest and the strongest countries, and then the Central Europeans, will turn away from the European dream.
但这也需要研发新型疫苗，该工作短期内可通过投资早期疫苗研究和其他可行替代抗生素的20亿美元全球创新基金加以启动。	But it also entails developing new vaccines, which, in the short-term, could be kick-started by a $2 billion Global Innovation Fund for early-stage research in vaccines and other viable alternatives to antibiotics.
其次，即使发生了奇迹，希腊真的在2020年达到了124%的目标，认为其时其债务将变得“可持续”也是荒谬的。	Second, even if, by some miracle, Greece did reach the 124% mark by 2020, the claim that its debt will then be “sustainable” is absurd.
重新谈判JCPOA，延长某些约束条件的期限、让检查更加深入，并将检查覆盖面扩大到导弹绝对很具有吸引力。	Renegotiating the JCPOA to extend the duration of several of its constraints, make inspections more intrusive, and expand its coverage to missiles is attractive in the abstract.
伊拉克安全部队最近截获了企图从伊朗进入伊拉克库尔德地区的人肉炸弹，而库尔德领导人则认为这些人肉炸弹是伊朗情报机构资助和培训出来的。	Security forces recently intercepted suicide bombers entering Iraqi Kurdistan from Iran, with, Kurdish leaders believe, the support and training of Iranian intelligence.
还有两个安全阀：宪法第25修正案，上面规定了推翻无法履行责任的总统以及因“严重犯罪和品行不端”弹劾总统的流程。	There are two other escape valves: the 25th Amendment, which charts a course for removing a president who is unable to discharge the responsibilities of office, and impeachment for “high crimes and misdemeanors.”
事实上，宪法宣言保护总统指令不受法官裁决影响（尽管穆尔西表示这只包括“主权”问题，而且只是权宜之计 ） 。	Indeed, the declaration protects presidential decrees from judicial review (although Morsi stipulated that it pertains only to “sovereignty” matters, and stressed its temporary nature).
他们希望英国人相信，不但伦敦金融城将仍然是欧洲顶级金融中心，英国也能继续进入欧盟单一市场，甚至连劳动力的自由流动也能保留。	They want Britons to believe not only that the City of London would remain Europe’s top financial center, but also that the UK would retain access to the EU’s single market, even without free movement of labor.
我们还将加快韩国-东盟自由贸易协定（FTA）进一步自由化的谈判，从而为更自由、更包容的地区增长铺平道路。	We will also accelerate the pace of negotiations for the further liberalization of a Korea-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA), in order to pave the way for freer and more inclusive growth in the region.
股东的民主权利显然在这里不起什么作用，当金融机构管理者认为股价会下跌很厉害的时候，他们可能遭受很大的损失，在这里高级金融就提供了一个有效地保证。	Shareholder democracy simply does not work, but managers’ fear that if the stock price drops too low they will be out on their ears provides a useful restraint.
确实，托克维尔所称的“社会力量”对于观点的控制在民主制度中可能最为强劲。 他的这一观点预言了当代蛊惑人心和媒体操纵的增长。	Indeed, what Tocqueville called the hold of “social power” on opinion is probably strongest in democratic regimes – a view that foretells the growth of modern-day demagogy and media manipulation.
民主制度的核心弱点也使问题变得愈加严重：拉选票需要扩大社会福利，从而使能确保经济可持续发展但不受民众欢迎的举措无人问津。	The central weakness of democratic systems also contributes to the problem: The quest for votes favors the extension of social benefits and discourages unpopular measures that would put the economy on a more sustainable footing.
1960年政治独立后，政权就一直在尼日利亚的主要种族¾南方的伊博和约鲁巴、还有北方的豪萨和富拉尼之间循环往复。	Since political independence in 1960, politics has revolved round Nigeria’s major ethnic groups – the Igbo and Yoruba in the south, and the Hausa and Fulani in the north.
那些在去年遭遇短期资本流出和资本市场下跌情况最严重的新兴经济体都经历了实际汇率大幅上升以及经常帐户状况的严重恶化。	The emerging economies hit hardest by short-term capital outflows and equity-market declines during the last year had experienced large appreciations in their real exchange rates and large deteriorations in their current-account positions.
如果一切顺利 — — 没有按揭、商业地产、企业贷款和信用卡方面的损失 — — 银行说不定还能勉强过关，不会陷入另外一场危机。	If nothing nasty happens – losses on mortgages, commercial real estate, business loans, and credit cards – the banks might just be able to make it through without another crisis.
人民币即将加入美元、英镑、欧元和日元的行列，成为决定国际货币基金组织（IMF）储备资产价值（SDR特别提款权）的货币篮子成员。	The Chinese renminbi is poised to join the US dollar, the British pound, the euro, and the Japanese yen in the basket of currencies that determines the value of the International Monetary Fund’s reserve asset, Special Drawing Rights.
推特服务的技术漏洞在此之前已经引发关注，目前正在向复杂的验证模型过渡（密码搭配经由短信或其他设备发送的一次性密钥 ） 。	Twitter’s vulnerabilities were technically understood before this event, and the service was already moving toward a more sophisticated authentication model (a password paired with a one-time key from a text message or other device).
中国受到亚洲天然实力平衡的制约，日本（世界第三大经济体）和印度（人口即将超过中国）都不希望受中国支配。	China is constrained by a natural balance of power in Asia in which Japan (the world’s third-largest economy) and India (about to surpass China in population) have no desire to be dominated by it.
但各种政治约束 — — 特别是囿于财政困难的经济体首先削减资本支出，然后才减少公共部门工资、补贴和其他当前支出 — — 让经济所需要的基础设施繁荣无从发生。	But a variety of political constraints – particularly the fact that fiscally strapped economies slash capital spending before cutting public-sector wages, subsidies, and other current spending – are holding back the needed infrastructure boom.
你想必也没有忘记安德鲁·威廉·梅隆（Andrew William Mellon）的鲁莽的著名建议：在大萧条前夕，他建议美国总统胡佛“出清劳动力，出清存货，出清农民，出清房地产 。 ”	And one should not forget Andrew William Mellon’s infamous and reckless advice to former US President Herbert Hoover on the eve of the Great Depression: “liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate.”
但如今，科学家已经弄清楚了如何去复制这一过程，让人类能够最精确地编辑具体的基因组 — — 这便是近50年来的基因工程圣杯。	But now scientists have figured out how to replicate the process, enabling humans to edit, with the utmost precision, specific genomes – the Holy Grail of genetic engineering for nearly 50 years.
实际在一次大战前，德国国家足球队就完全由波兰裔球员组成，但最重要的是，波兰人、匈牙利人、捷克人和其它东欧人一直坚定地认为自己是欧洲人。	Indeed, before World War I the German national football team consisted entirely of players with Polish names. But, above all, there is a deep sense among Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and others, that they are Europeans.
2003年，施罗德将改革的必要性置于对欧盟《稳定与增长公约》的严格遵守之上，因为他需要额外的财政空间来缓和大幅度劳动市场改革所引发的经济调整，而让改革优先于对规则的死板遵守也最终被证明是一个很好的决策。	Additional fiscal leeway was needed to smooth the economy’s adjustment to the bold labor-market reforms that he was introducing. The decision to prioritize reforms over obstinate rule-following proved to be a good one.
但是，为了一小撮政治献金者的利益，美国政府似乎铁了心要人为扶持这个行业，而让美国消费者和出口商、墨西哥农民以及环境付出代价。	But, for the sake of a few wealthy political donors, the US government seems committed to sustain that industry artificially, at the expense of US consumers and exporters, Mexican farmers, and the environment.
许多人担心在1999年变成2000年的时候，由于依赖电脑，医院、飞机、电网以及通讯都会陷于瘫痪而产生千年灾难。	There was widespread fear that dependence on computers would produce a millennial catastrophe, as hospitals, airplanes, power grids, and communications would all grind to a halt when 1999 became 2000.
中国反对核扩散，但由于它希望保持朝鲜半岛分裂、确保朝鲜成为其边境上的稳定缓冲国，因此对于反对核扩散并不十分上心。	China opposes proliferation, but not as much as it wants to maintain a divided Korean Peninsula and ensure that North Korea remains a stable buffer state on its borders.
因此中国在与中东的贸易中呈现逆差，但与美国贸易则为顺差。 但这种双边贸易平衡并不能体现中国对全球不平衡的总体影响。	So China can have a trade deficit with the Middle East and a trade surplus with the US, but these bilateral balances indicate nothing about China’s overall contribution to global imbalances.
不幸的是，我们仍然看到欧洲和其他地方的工会组织在劳方的工作保障问题上耗费了太多的精力，而不是学会如何深层次地考虑金融问题。	Unfortunately, instead of learning how to think in financially sophisticated ways, we still see labor unions in Europe and elsewhere dwelling too much on job security for working people.
比如官方最近宣布司法独立和分权是应该抛弃的“殖民地”产物，并由中国政府和香港首席执行官、而非地方法院来做出决定。	For example, officials recently declared that judicial independence and the separation of powers are “colonial” legacies that should be discarded, with China’s government and Hong Kong’s chief executive, not the local courts, calling all the shots.
由于这个职位的任命并不需要国会的批准，总统可以指派任何他想要的人，而不会因他的选择被美国参议院痛骂。	Because this position does not require Congressional approval, the president may appoint whomever he wants, without having his choice raked over the coals in the US Senate.
如果经济衰退的深度达到本次衰退实际深度的两倍，美国就会遭受约2万亿美元的损失，而全世界的损失总额更会四倍于此。	As Fed Vice Chairman Don Kohn said, ensuring that a few thousand investment bankers receive their just financial punishment is a non-starter when attempts to do so put the jobs of millions of Americans – and tens of millions outside the US – at risk.
因此，大可以期待美国当选总统特朗普的政府 — — 不管它是否保守 — — 将积极地使用财政赤字来为它的税收和支出重点项目融资。	So expect US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, conservative or not, to make aggressive use of budget deficits to fund its priorities for taxes and spending.
颇具讽刺意味的是，上述问题发生的同时长期被批评为内向、孤立和自我迷恋的硅谷和其他地方的技术型企业正在以最快的速度“融入 ” 。	The irony is that all of this is coming at a time when technology companies in Silicon Valley and beyond, long criticized as inward-looking, isolationist, and self-obsessed, are moving as fast as they can to be “in.”
凯恩斯主义者宣称“需求”主宰一切 — — 增加就业，从而提振投资乃至增长全靠需求 — — 这站不住脚。	Keynesians’ claim that “demand” is all-powerful – that it alone increases employment and thus investment and even growth – was groundless.
发自旧金山 — — 这是一个大众恐慌自动化工业会让人类工作岗位消失的时代，媒体上充斥着悲观的标题，警告机器人的大规模应用会让某些职业门类彻底不复存在。	SAN FRANCISCO – This is an age of anxiety about the job-killing effects of automation, with dire headlines warning that the rise of robots will render entire occupational categories obsolete.
事实上，尽管伊斯兰国斩首两名日本人质如此生动地展现了日本的无力，但日本仍没有对1947年占日美军所制定的“和平宪法”做出哪怕一项修订。	Indeed, despite the powerlessness so vividly highlighted by the Islamic State’s beheading of two Japanese hostages, Japan has not adopted even one amendment to the “peace constitution” that the occupying American forces imposed on it in 1947.
国际货币基金组织仓促地让西方人购买银行，却忘记了一个细节，那就是确保韩国可以通过税收重新获取至少些许收益。	In its rush to have westerners buy the banks, the IMF forgot one detail: to ensure that South Korea could recapture at least a fraction of those gains through taxation.
此外，IMF — — 而不是G-20 — — 应该扮演更积极的角色，成为真正的全球宏观经济政策协调工具。	This should be combined with a more active role for the IMF – rather than the G-20 – as the true instrument of global macroeconomic policy coordination.
以色列军方没有满足该组织的要求 — — 释放53名关押在以色列和其他四国的军人 — — 而是发动了霹雳行动（Operation Thunderbolt ） ， 在乌干达恩德培（Entebbe）机场解救了人质。	Instead of giving the group what they wanted – the release of 53 militants imprisoned in Israel and four other countries – the Israeli Army launched Operation Thunderbolt, rescuing the hostages at Uganda’s Entebbe Airport.
发自北京 — — 回顾2011年最后一个季度，当时中国的投资增长加速下滑，加上官方不愿实施新经济扩张政策，使人们对经济硬着陆的担忧不断加剧。	BEIJING – Back in the last quarter of 2011, when the decline in China’s investment growth accelerated, concerns about a hard economic landing intensified, particularly given the authorities’ reluctance to pursue new expansionary policies.
全球化可以定义为不同大陆之间的相互依赖，它的历史和人类的历史一样悠久，见证了种族和宗教的迁移，也见证了中世纪欧洲和亚洲之间古老丝绸之路沿途的贸易。	Globalization, which can be defined as interdependence at inter-continental distances, is as old as human history. Witness the migration of peoples and religions, or trade along the ancient silk route that connected medieval Europe and Asia.
但即使是当前贸易规则所允许的过度保护主义的反倾销措施，也没有对贸易造成过度伤害，同时又为政治压力提供了安全阀。	Yet even the overtly protectionist anti-dumping measures allowed under existing trade rules have not been overly damaging to trade, while providing an escape valve for political pressure.
在这样的情况下，因为许多少女必须在工厂工作和嫁人之间作出选择，禁止工厂雇用十八岁以下少女带来的坏处可能多于好处。	In such a situation, when many young girls must choose between factory work and marrying young, banning factory employment for girls under 18 would do more harm than good.
来自中东的危险多种多样，包括地区冲突、专制的宗教意识形态(主要由什叶派的伊朗和瓦哈比的沙特领导 ) 、 恐怖主义、核军备规划、对现代化的阻碍以及政权不稳。	The threats emanating from the Middle East are diverse: regional conflicts, totalitarian religious ideologies (mainly led by Shia Iran and Wahhabi Saudi Arabia), terrorism, nuclear armament programs, obstacles to modernization, and unstable regimes.
日本学者萩原义久（Yoshihisa Hagiwara）认为，既然民族国家不是建立在事实基础上的，那么，民族国家神话就一定会消散，让位于我们只是作为全球共同体的一部分的个人这样一种认识。	Japanese scholar Yoshihisa Hagiwara argues that since it is not grounded in fact, the nation-state myth is bound to dissolve, giving way to an understanding that we are merely individuals who are part of a global community.
接着，欧洲委员会将继续发展我们的当前方案，纳入存款担保机制和银行破产机制，向单一破产基金和单一破产管理当局的方向迈进。	Next, the Commission will build on our current proposals for deposit-guarantee schemes and bank resolution mechanisms to move toward a single resolution fund and a single resolution authority.
剑桥－在当前的危机中，也有对发展中国家有利的一面，因为它们会以在支配经济全球化的制度机构中拥有更大影响力的姿态出现。	CAMBRIDGE – There is a silver lining for developing nations in the present crisis, for they will emerge with a much bigger say in the institutions that govern economic globalization.
如果没有这次导弹发射，金氏王朝对权力的把控几乎肯定会因金正恩的年轻和经验不足而逐渐削弱，从而导致朝鲜局势陷入混乱之中。	Without it, the Kim dynasty’s hold on power would almost certainly weaken, given Kim Jong-un’s youth and inexperience, plunging the country into chaos.
安曼 — — 8月由世界各地穆斯林学者批准的伊斯兰气候变化宣言呼吁各国逐步淘汰温室气体排放并转而使用100%的可再生能源。	AMMAN – The Islamic Declaration on Climate Change, endorsed in August by Islamic scholars from around the world, calls on countries to phase out greenhouse-gas emissions and switch to 100% renewable energy.
要想击败病毒，我们必须摒弃将伊斯兰教徒视为反西方科学暴力狂热份子的讽刺画，���真审视病毒根除工作迄今为止尚未取得成功的特定政治环境。	If the virus is to be defeated, we will have to move beyond caricatures of Islamists as violent zealots opposed to Western science and look closely at the specific political contexts in which the eradication effort has so far been unsuccessful.
该地区大国政治领导人面临着 — — 或即将面临 — — 刑事指控，其罪名之大足以让人怀疑民主本身能否在这些国家中生存下去。	The list of major national political leaders in the region who have faced, or are about to face, criminal charges has grown so extensive that it is plausible to wonder whether democracy itself can survive in a number of these countries.
特朗普正式就职恰逢JCPOA达成一周年，因此有必要回忆一下它是如何达成的 — — 以及如果它被撕毁会发生什么。	The JCPOA’s first anniversary coincided with Trump’s inauguration, so it is worth recalling how it came about – and what could happen if it falls apart.
复杂的解决方案 — — 如监狱改革和新毒品法也许在技术和道德上是正确的，但没能转化为选民支持；承诺向蟊贼（或游击队员）开枪可以。	Complex solutions, such as prison reform and new drug laws, may be technically and morally right, but they do not translate into electoral support; a promise to shoot thieves (or guerrillas) does.
全球战略有利于这一目标，但在注意力完全集中在另一项挑战，特别是这项挑战可能给欧盟带来根本性变化时绝非如此。	The global strategy could serve that purpose, but not if it is issued at a time when attention is squarely focused on another challenge, especially one that could bring about fundamental change for the EU.
这一结论显而易见，但世界用了几千年的时间才得出这一结论 — — 并且，从很多角度看，仍然没有完全接受这一结论。	As obvious as this conclusion might seem, the world has taken millennia to reach it – and, in many ways, has yet to accept it fully.
虽然该国自2008年以来在此方面取得了重大进展，但其贸易相对GDP的比率（37 ％ ） 以及出口相对GDP的比率（18 ％ ） 仍明显高于美国，日本和其他大型经济体。	Though the country has made significant progress on this front since 2008, its total trade-to-GDP ratio (37%) and export-to-GDP ratio (18%) remain significantly higher than those of the US, Japan, and other large economies.
以皇室和电影明星开始的娱乐八卦已经成长为对隐私的大规模的侵犯，报纸声称任何试图将他们置于卧室之外的行为都是对言论自由的侵害。	What started off as entertaining gossip about royalty and film stars has burgeoned into a massive assault on privacy, with newspapers claiming that any attempt to keep them out of the bedroom is an assault on free speech.
这一变化可能是因为20世纪80年代至2007年间的通胀低迷时期同时也伴随着有利的经济环境，这段时间也被人们共同称之为“大稳健 ” 。	That change may have been due to the benign economic conditions that accompanied the period of disinflation from the late 1980s to 2007, commonly referred to as the “Great Moderation.”
金融部门得到的补贴之巨令人咋舌，在现行政策下，补贴还将进一步增加 — — 这些补贴的首要作用是支持了最发达国家最高端1%人群的生活方式。	The extent of subsidies in this sector is stunning and, under current policies, will only increase over time – thereby primarily supporting the lifestyles of the top 1% of people in very rich countries.
除了依赖实验室对某一单一生物标记的报告之外，一个直接从病人病历中提取所需数据的慢性病监测系统才是最理想的。	Rather than relying on laboratory reporting of a single biomarker, an ideal chronic-disease surveillance system would extract all necessary data directly from the patient record.
北朝鲜也没有把奥巴马的警告当回事。 此前奥巴马声称如果北朝鲜对抗联合国，坚持发射火箭，美国会将其击落。	Nor was North Korea impressed by Obama’s warnings that America might shoot down its rocket if they went ahead with their launch in defiance of the United Nations.
这种反日情绪的复杂性和根深蒂固性使得它延续至今，与中国人对其他一些国家更为短暂矛盾的敌对情绪有所不同，比如有时中国人还庇护美国人。	The complexity and depth of these anti-Japanese sentiments helps sustain them and sets them apart from other, more fleeting and contradictory anti-foreign sentiments, such as those Chinese sometimes harbor towards Americans.
他的耐心，文雅以及和解政治都为我提供了一个民主和优秀治理和的绝佳范本，比所有公民教育都要更加生动和深刻。	His patience, civility, and politics of reconciliation provided me a better example of democracy and good governance than any civics class could have done.
鲁哈尼面临的局面是无法再卖出石油，并且伊朗中央银行遭遇美国和欧盟封杀，提振增长和稳定物价上涨成为鲁哈尼面前的巨大挑战。	Unable to sell oil, and faced with a blockade of the central bank by the United States and the EU, Rouhani faced the momentous challenge of trying to kick-start growth and tame spiraling prices.
俱乐部制餐馆“普罗尼上校”恰好位于克格勃总部附近，是以苏联时代拙劣间谍小说的主人公来命名的，此人也是很多秘密笑话中当之无愧的主角。	The club-restaurant “Major Pronin:” is conveniently located in the vicinity of the KGB-FSB headquarters. It is named after the hero of bad Soviet-era spy novels, a figure who was also the butt of many underground jokes.
这些措施将受到投资者关注 — — 他们无法再指望危机时有印钞机拯救他们，因此将迫使他们要求更高的利率，或在一开始就不提供信用。	Such measures would serve notice to investors that they cannot hope to be saved by the printing press in times of crisis, and would thus compel them to demand higher interest rates or deter them from granting credit in the first place.
此类情况同样发生在世界的其他地方，例如俄罗斯，乌克兰，匈牙利，巴基斯坦，土耳其，马来西亚，墨西哥，尼日利亚等国家。 国内不同的政策走向往往导致推出经济政策的不连贯性。	In Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Pakistan, Turkey, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, and other states, battles among domestic political factions will yield often-incoherent responses to pressing economic problems.
如果美国通过有的放矢的公共政策实现这些重大步骤 — — 这也是奥巴马的规划 — — 那么由此产生的创新科学、新技术和强大的示范效应将会让全世界所有国家受益。	If America realizes these bold steps through purposeful public policies, as Obama outlined, the innovative science, new technology, and powerful demonstration effects that result will benefit countries around the world.
如今，这一概念已经来了个一百八十度大转弯：随着经济增长的停滞，贸易伙伴下降的进口需求导致了经济不景气的蔓延和深化。	That notion has now been turned on its head: as economic growth has stalled, falling import demand from trade partners has caused economic woes to spread and deepen.
然而之前银行在风险投资中的过度负债和损失引发了全球金融危机，并导致了许多主要金融机构濒临或完全破产。	But excessive indebtedness and losses on the risky investments that had been made triggered the global financial crisis and led to the failure, or near-failure, of many major financial institutions.
放任无度的“借钱花”政策和使用公用事业领域的租赁来拉拢政治小团体的做法同样导致了黎巴嫩的巨额债务问题。	So were the profligate borrow-and-spend policies and the use of public-sector hiring to co-opt political factions, both of which resulted in Lebanon’s massive debt problem.
“重商主义者”可以定义为相信只有贸易盈余较高的国家才能受益的观点的人，反之，因此出现较高贸易赤字的贸易伙伴蒙受损失。	A “mercantilist” could be defined as someone who believes that gains go only to the country that enjoys a higher trade surplus, mirrored by losses for the trading partner that runs a correspondingly higher deficit.
但在过去的十年里，一系列的丑闻和危机 — — 包括公共安全，黑心食品和假药，以及环境污染 — — 已经彻底摧毁了它仅存的一点信誉。	But, in the last decade, a series of scandals and crises – involving public safety, adulterated food and drugs, and environmental pollution – has thoroughly destroyed what little credibility lingered.
丹佛 — — 就在几天前，原计划在新加坡举行的美国总统唐纳德`特朗普和朝鲜领导人金正恩之间的峰会似乎命悬一线。	DENVER – Just days ago, the planned summit in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un seemed to be hanging by a thread.
其中一个最重大发现就是数种在高能短距离情况下观察到的明显现象可以清晰地归结于胶子的释放和胶子结构的形成。	One of its most important discoveries was that several distinct phenomena observed at high energies and short distances could be clearly attributed to the emission of gluons and the emergence of gluonic structures.
没有美国安全伞下的遏制政策，红军就会扼杀东欧的自由之梦，也许也会统一欧洲，但却在绣着红星的旗帜之下。	Without the policy of containment under America's security umbrella, the Red Army would have strangled the dream of freedom in Eastern Europe, or brought European unity, but under a flag with red stars.
华盛顿—两年前，特斯拉CEO艾龙·马斯克（Elon Musk）决定向所有人开放公司专利 — — 这一做法与传统竞争行为完全背道而驰。	WASHINGTON, DC – Two years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk decided to open access to his company’s patents to anyone – a move that ran completely counter to traditional competitive behavior.
但对一个已是位居其后的日本两倍规模，并且可能在未来五年内超越欧盟的经济体来说，这样的速度一点都不“常 ” 。	But there is nothing normal about an economy that is already twice as large as the next largest, Japan, and will possibly outstrip the European Union within the next five years.
贝卢斯科尼最大的成功 — — 特别是在2001到2006年和2008到2011年任上（1994到1995年他同样担任总理 ） — —就在于对媒体和公众舆论的操纵。	Berlusconi’s greatest successes – especially during his 2001-2006 and 2008-2011 terms (he also served in 1994-1995) – lay in the manipulation of media and public opinion.
目前，亚洲占全球国民生产总值38 % ， 与它在1820年的份额相比，相差甚远。 但两个国家都觉得他们能够，而且必须参与到主导世界的行列中来。	Asia’s current share of global GDP (about 38%) is still far from what it was in 1820, but both countries feel that they can – and must – participate in calling the global shots.
的确，在2002年莫斯科Dubrovka 剧院人质危机之后，俄国内充斥着同样的强硬言论，但却没有追加资金。	Indeed, after the hostage crisis in the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow in 2002, the same sort of harsh words flowed, but no extra money was spent.
在这一预言的背后，是对阿富汗（和伊拉克不同）的趋势在向负面发展，以及如果不想让塔利班占上风，美国必须加强其在阿富汗的军事存在并修正其策略的广泛共识判断。	Behind this prediction is a widely shared assessment that the trends in Afghanistan (unlike in Iraq) are negative, and that the US must strengthen its military presence there and revise its strategy if the Taliban are not to gain the upper hand.
清迈协议可以帮助东亚国家减少对积累的依赖，而这种积累其实是一种助长全球不平衡的自保式且成本巨大的储蓄。	The CMIM could help East Asian countries to reduce their reliance on accumulating, as a form of self-insurance, costly reserves that fuel global imbalances.
这种分歧在另外一个跨大西洋争论中也一样显著，即欧盟是否会取消15年前天门广场事件发生后对中国实施的武器禁运。	The divisions are no less marked in another transatlantic quarrel, this one over whether to lift the European Union’s embargo on arms exports to China, imposed following the Tiananmen Square massacre 15 years ago.
重估是债务重组的委婉说法，它让各国以更长期限、更低利率从现有债权人处借钱，债务国在公开市场上无法获得这样的条件。	Reprofiling is a euphemism for debt restructuring, which allows countries to borrow from existing creditors for longer periods and at lower interest rates than they would be able to do on the open market.
指出政府联合政党之间的分歧，以及单个政府政党之间的分歧，都被延迟了，一直到正式加入欧盟以后才重新提及。	Addressing conflicts among government coalition parties, as well as within individual government parties, was postponed until after official EU entry.
可以肯定的是，基本模型 — — 例如垄断与简单的寡头垄断理论，公共产品理论，或简单的信息不对称理论 — — 都有一定的教育价值，但研究者其实很少在工作中用到这些。	To be sure, basic models – for example, theories of monopoly and simple oligopoly, the theory of public goods, or simple asymmetric-information theory – have some educational value. But few researchers actually work with them.
研究者称，从1996年到2010年，转基因作物的推广将美国农民的收益提高了大约32亿美元，其中24亿美元好处产生于未种植转基因作物的相邻地块。	The researchers calculated that, from 1996 to 2010, cultivating GM varieties increased farmers’ profits in three US states by roughly $3.2 billion – $2.4 billion of which accrued to farmers whose nearby fields had not been planted with GM varieties.
但事实上，尽管我们并没有像期望的那样达成开启可持续低碳发展时代的全面强制性协议，但哥本哈根会议已经取得了相当大的进展。	In fact, though we did not get a comprehensive, legally binding treaty that would usher in an era of sustainable, low-carbon prosperity, as we had hoped, there were significant achievements in Copenhagen.
瓦尔曾要求法庭终止其死刑，因为在死刑名单上呆如此之久堪称一种“残忍且不寻常的惩罚”因此也是美国宪法所不容的。	Valle had asked the court to halt his execution, on the grounds that to spend so long on death row is “cruel and unusual punishment” and therefore prohibited by the US constitution.
夕阳产业的工人可能需要全新的技能才能在其他部门找到工作，并且他们可能需要举家离开扎根已深的居住地追求这些新机会。	Workers in a shrinking industry may need entirely new skills to find jobs in other sectors, and they may have to pack up their families and pull up deep roots to pursue these opportunities.
科罗拉多大学社会学家蒂姆·华斯沃夫（Tim Wadsworth）在其2014发表的《性和对幸福的追求：其他人的性生活如何与我们的幸福感有关》研究中重复了厄普代克的判断：性就像金钱。	The University of Colorado sociologist Tim Wadsworth, in his 2014 study, “Sex and the Pursuit of Happiness: How Other People’s Sex Lives are Related to our Sense of Well-Being,” repeats Updike’s assertion that sex is like money.
以色列宣布将在巴勒斯坦建设9000套新的居住单元，设在西岸地区的路障数量还在增加，而对加沙的压制则更紧了。	Nine thousand new Israeli settlement housing units have been announced in Palestine, the number of roadblocks within the West bank has increased, and the stranglehold on Gaza has been tightened.
但一些观察家，如诺贝尔奖获得者保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）和前美国财政部长劳伦斯·萨默斯（Larry Summers ） ， 依然质疑QE是否真的有用。	But some observers, such as Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman and former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, continue to doubt whether QE can really be effective.
到2020年，全球互联网人口将达到五十亿；创建十亿新机器对机器（machine-to-machine）连接；移动数据量将增长11倍。	By 2020, the global Internet population will reach five billion; ten billion new machine-to-machine connections will be created; and mobile data traffic will rise 11-fold.
结果，即使是表面上独立或私人的行为，也会给西方组织带来政治和名誉风险，有可能被指控成为中国“影响力的代理人 ” 。	As a result, even ostensibly independent or private activities can carry political and reputational risks for Western organizations, which may be accused of acting as “agents of influence” for China.
凭借一个充斥着高盛校友的内阁，以及一个在为超富阶层减税的同时私有化医保和教育的承诺，特朗普让那些选他进入白宫的白人工薪阶层失望是命中注定的。	With an administration full of Goldman Sachs alumni, and an agenda that promises tax cuts for the super-rich while privatizing Medicare and education, Trump is bound to disappoint the white working class that won him the White House.
令人瞩目的新纪录片《我所居住的房子 》 （ The House I Live In）表明，美国的情况甚至刚才我所描述的更凄惨、更残酷。	A remarkable new documentary film, The House I Live In, shows that America’s story is even sadder and crueler than that, owing to disastrous policies.
这种说法被频繁提及 ， （ 根据每年出版物页数进行调整后）首见于1969年伦敦黄金总库（London Gold Pool）崩溃之后。 伦敦黄金总库是由八家央行组成的联合支持美元盯住黄金的安排。	The frequency of such mentions, adjusted for the number of printed pages per year, first jumped in 1969, following the collapse of the London Gold Pool, an arrangement in which eight central banks cooperated to support the dollar’s peg to gold.
毫不奇怪，这引起了制药巨头及其游说集团的强烈反弹：他们指出，该项判决破坏了创新激励，将给全球公共卫生造成严重打击。	Not surprisingly, this has led to an overwrought response from them and their lobbyists: the ruling, they allege, destroys the incentive to innovate, and thus will deal a serious blow to public health globally.
著名的联合国前秘书长哈马舍尔德（Dag Hammarskjöld）有一句名言 ： “ 联合国不是用来让人类上天堂的，而是用来拯救人类不下地狱的 。 ”	As the legendary Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld famously put it, “The United Nations was not created to take mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell.”
但不幸的是，在公共健康和卫生保健领域，创新理念的扩散和传播这一过程通常无规律可循，杂乱无章，效率低下。	Unfortunately, the diffusion and dissemination of innovative ideas in the fields of public health and health care is generally a random, haphazard, and inefficient process.
虽然受到邪恶的小兄弟北韩随时崩盘的危险，韩国坚实的经济实力随时准备接纳来自邻国的难民潮。 土耳其也有类似的情况：生机勃勃的银行业，发展势头强劲的国内市场，对中东和能源政策影响力日益增加。	The same is true of Turkey, with its robust banking sector, thriving domestic market, growing importance to Middle East and energy politics, NATO membership, European Union membership bid, and ties to ethnic cousins across Central Asia.
这些长着四条腿的点心经常会忽视近在眼前的信息 — — 比如草丛中的沙沙作响或者路过的食肉动物的气味。	Too often, these four-legged snacks ignore information right in front of them – like rustling in the underbrush or the scent of a passing carnivore.
在恐怖主义问题上，他们打破了联合国长期以来的僵局，没有一如既往地忙着为“恐怖主义”下定义，或者谴责所有针对平民百姓的袭击，而是提出了一系列可供成员国采取的措施。	On terrorism, they break the long UN impasse over finding a definition, condemning all attacks against civilians, and propose a number of measures that member states should take.
与此同时，欧元区外围的信贷动荡正在加剧：拜欧洲央行长期低息贷款所赐，外围国银行现在不会有流动性问题，但却存在大规模资本短缺。	Meanwhile, the credit crunch in the eurozone periphery is intensifying: thanks to the ECB long-term cheap loans, banks there don’t have a liquidity problem now, but they do have a massive capital shortage.
一年前，美、英、法似乎支持沙特的立场，拒绝了前联合国秘书长科菲·安南邀请伊朗参加日内瓦首次结束叙利亚内战谈判的要求。	A year ago, the US, the UK, and France appeared to side with Saudi Arabia when they rejected former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s request that Iran be invited to the first attempt in Geneva to negotiate a settlement of Syria’s civil war.
我们不需要成为一个经济学家就能明白，货币能（或者确实）对其他资产（比如黄金、土地和其他不动产）贬值，但显然它们不能全体一起相互贬值。	One need not be an economist to figure out that, while all currencies can (and do) depreciate against something else (like gold, land, and other real assets), by definition they cannot all weaken against each other.
美国总统奥巴马明白 — — 或许比此前的美国总统都更明白 — — 国际法的重要性，这也是他欲将中国等国完全纳入国际法框架中的原因。	US President Barack Obama understands – probably better than any previous US president – the significance of international law, which is why he wants to bring countries like China fully within its strictures.
支持伦齐阵营要求选民批准的宪政改革将剪除一些其前任贝卢斯科尼的遗产 — — 这些遗产显著地表明了右翼民粹主义可能一个国家带来什么伤害。	The constitutional changes that Renzi’s Yes campaign is asking voters to approve would undo some of his predecessor Silvio Berlusconi’s legacy – a legacy that serves as a prime example of the damage right-wing populism can do to a country.
朝鲜一直固执地坚持只有13名日本人被绑架的官方说法；其中有八人死亡，五人在抵达平壤前就已经归还给日本。	North Korea has stubbornly maintained its official line that only 13 Japanese were kidnapped; eight died and five were returned to Japan before ever making it to Pyongyang.
