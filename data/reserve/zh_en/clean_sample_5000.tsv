在此次地震发生一年多之后的2010年7月，检查官法比奥·皮库迪（Fabio Picuti）以误杀和玩忽职守罪对委员会成员提起公诉，认为他们未能将如此迫近的危险告知公众。	More than a year later, in July 2010, prosecutor Fabio Picuti charged the Commission members with manslaughter and negligence for failing to warn the public of the impending risk.
许多新兴经济体领导人担心本国资产价格出现泡沫和资本涌入导致货币升值压力，一时间怨声四起，巴西财政部长曼特加（Guido Mantega）称之为“国际货币战争 ” 。	Fearing domestic asset-price bubbles and upward pressure on their currencies from an inward rush of capital, many emerging-economy leaders complained loudly about what Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega called an “international currency war.”
对于这一点，可能的原因有很多，但戈登描述了其中一种可能：作为基础的创新速度放慢了，这导致投资预期回报降低，从而拉低了利率。	There may be many reasons for this, but Gordon describes one possibility: The underlying pace of innovation has slowed, leading to lower expected returns on investment and thus forcing down interest rates.
首先，佐利克是将中国带入世界贸易组织的关键人物。 在布什政府中，国际主义者有时候看起来像是濒危物种，而佐利克就是一位确定无疑的国际主义者。	First, as a key player in bringing China into the World Trade Organization, Zoellick is a proven internationalist in an American administration where internationalists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species.
因此我的基金会拥有一个大学项目 — — 目前在九个国家的院校中推行 — — 目的就是将宗教从神学院的高墙背后解放出来，并开始研究其在当今世界上所扮演的角色。	So my Foundation has a university program – now underway in nine countries – that is designed to take religion out of the sole preserve of divinity schools and start analyzing its role in the world today.
我在2014年出版了一本关于美中之间经济依赖关系的书，并可能首先提出了下述观点：要将人类心理学的相关成果归纳延伸出来去评估国家经济行为。	While I published a book in 2014 on the codependent economic relationship between the US and China, I would be the first to concede that it is a stretch to generalize insights from human psychology to assess the behavior of national economies.
对伊拉克而言更重要的是，阿巴迪领导下的巴格达中央政府必须战胜数十年来分裂该国的宗派势力，在美国领导的侵略行动驱逐萨达姆侯赛因后，宗派势力大大增强。	More crucial for Iraq, the central government in Baghdad, led by Abadi, must overcome the sectarianism that has divided the country for decades, and that intensified in the aftermath of the United States-led invasion to oust Saddam Hussein.
如今两年过去了，已经兑现的承诺却比预期中要少得多，当前的伦齐更像是个政治稳定的担保人，而不是像他从前的绰号“rottamatore”那样成为一台横扫旧势力的推土机。	Two years later, far less change than expected has materialized, and Renzi has come to resemble a guarantor of political stability more than a rottamatore – a “scraper of the old,” as he had been nicknamed.
几年前，美国降低了资本收入的联邦税，并逐步取消了房地产遗产税，这只能让最顶层1%获益 — — 被广泛视为富人炫耀政治权力。	A few years ago, the US reduced federal taxes on capital income and phased out the estate tax, benefiting only the upper 1% – moves widely viewed as demonstrating the political power of the rich.
美国国务卿蒂勒森认识到世界“重心正在转向印度-太平洋心脏地带 ” ， 呼吁域内民主力量寻求“更大的参与和合作 ” 。	US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, recognizing that the world’s “center of gravity is shifting to the heart of the Indo-Pacific,” called on the region’s democratic powers to pursue “greater engagement and cooperation.”
这一观点也是二战后初期的发展援助计划 — — 当时世界银行和双边捐助者向新独立国家输送资源以资助大型项目建设 — — 的理论基础。	It also lay behind early development assistance programs following World War II, when the World Bank and bilateral donors funneled resources to newly independent countries to finance large-scale projects.
此后，沃森又继续取得了大量成就，证明了认知计算可以使用大数据处理某些人类所面临的最困难的系统性问题的。	Since then, Watson has gone on to do much more, demonstrating how cognitive computing can use big data to tackle some of the most difficult systemic issues facing humanity.
因此，当意识形态与其势不两立的共和党反对派在其入主白宫的第一天就采取焦土政策，把这一愿景当着他的面踩得粉碎的时候，其拒绝合作并非只关乎政策，而是影响到了奥巴马的为人。	So, when an ideologically implacable Republican opposition, in his very first days in office, threw the vision back in his face, adopting a policy of scorched-earth opposition, the rejection was about more than policy – it affected his very being.
根据麻省理工学院十亿美元价格计划的估算，委内瑞拉1月份的食品价格通胀率达到了117.6 ％ ， 相当于每年1130000 ％ 。	According to estimates from MIT’s Billion Prices Project, month-on-month food inflation in Venezuela reached 117.6% in January, or the equivalent of 1,130,000% a year.
贝淡宁提出中国的威权主义 — — 特别是它的“精英政治 ” — —是一种可行的治理模式，甚至可能比印度和西方的民主制度还要好。	Bell argues that Chinese authoritarianism – specifically, its “political meritocracy” – is a viable model of governance, possibly even superior to the democracy of India and the West.
受糟糕的路况、不安全的社区或父母无法接送（或没车）等因素的制约，学生在放学后去同学家继续学习可能并不容易。	It might be difficult for a child to go to a classmate’s house to study after school, because of bad roads, unsafe neighborhoods, or parents who are working and cannot provide a lift (or do not own a car).
但是如果迄今为止在波斯尼亚或科索沃成功的国际干涉最终以悲剧告终的话，这样的说法就不会有那么大的说服力。	But this claim will be devalued if the so far successful international interventions in Bosnia or Kosovo end in tragedy.
波士顿—在2月的亚的斯亚贝巴，非洲各国卫生部长签署了一份广受欢迎的宣言，承诺将免疫作为拯救非洲儿童免遭死亡和疾病的措施的核心。	BOSTON – In February in Addis Ababa, African health ministers signed a widely celebrated declaration of their commitment to keeping immunization at the forefront of efforts to save the continent’s children from death and disease.
中国资产负债表上的资产一面非常巨大，通过私有化来对其进行收缩的策略已经被摈弃了，至少目前来说是如此。	In China, where the asset side of the balance sheet is large, the strategy of shrinking it via privatization has been largely rejected, at least for now.
债权人的坚持表明，欧元区决策者 — — 特别是德国人 — — 死守着一个概念框架，这个框架导致他们一直低估了情况的严重性、要求采取让情况雪上加霜的政策。	That insistence reflects the attachment of policymakers in the EU – especially in Germany – to a conceptual framework that has led them consistently to underestimate the gravity of the situation and recommend policies that make matters worse.
用技术官僚主导的国内联合政府取代由民选政治家主导的政府并不能从根本上改变国外要求意大利实施改革的事实。	A national-unity government run by a technocrat in place of an administration run by elected politicians does not qualitatively change the fact that outsiders are demanding reforms.
我们可以憧憬在以美元计价的证券热潮消退以后，目前以美国为目的地的金融流就会平缓地改道，从而推动亚洲的投资。	It would be nice to believe that when the tide of dollar-denominated securities ebbs, the flows of finance currently directed at America will smoothly shift course and boost investment in Asia.
他们是否会继续奉行以无核化为主的“战略耐心”政策，让朝鲜率先在其他领域采取行动，静候新领袖出现结果？	Will they wait to see what happens to the new leader, and thus continue their policy of “strategic patience,” which focuses mainly on denuclearization, and not move on to other areas until the North moves first?
牛津—在关于新闻的未来的争论中 ， “ 假新闻”是中心议题，其特色内容是一位慷慨激昂的美国总统，俄罗斯通讯“机器人 ” ， 以及为了争夺公共注意力的背叛和花招。	OXFORD – In the debate over the future of journalism, “fake news” has taken center stage, with storylines featuring a ranting American president, Russian communication “bots,” and betrayal and subterfuge competing for public attention.
向欧盟规则和监管的靠拢过程是痛苦的，但帮助波兰在20世纪90年代成为正常欧洲国家，如今也可以帮助乌克兰治理其贿赂、任人唯亲和裙带关系等问题。	The painstaking approximation of EU rules and regulation that helped Poland become a normal European country by the late 1990’s would offer Ukraine the prospect of taming its own demons of bribery, cronyism, and nepotism.
然而，在下次在2009年5月之前将要举行的全国大选中，可能会有一个贱民出来竞争总理的职位-她就是库·玛雅瓦提，印度最大的邦-北方邦-的女性首席部长。	Yet the next national elections, due before May 2009, may produce a plausible Dalit contender for the job of prime minister – Kumari Mayawati, the female chief minister of India’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh.
比如说，我们之所以坚决抵制伊朗的核能军事化，正是因为我们站在欧洲人的立场来考虑问题，而不是因为我们作为美国盟友的身份。	We should, for example, want to prevent the militarization of nuclear energy in Iran precisely because of our concern as Europeans, not because we are allies of the US.
麦肯锡全球研究所（McKinsey Global Institute）指出，除了跨国金融，全球流动与危机前一样强劲。	As the McKinsey Global Institute noted, with the exception of cross-border finance, global flows are just as robust now as they were before the crisis.
银行存在即便是很小程度的流动性紧缩的事实预示着集中管制程度较低的金融机构面临较大的流动性紧缩，而制造业和房地产公司则面临更大的流动性紧缩。	The fact that there is even a small liquidity crunch for banks implies larger liquidity crunches for less intensively regulated financial institutions, and even greater liquidity crunches for manufacturing and real-estate companies.
但如果一国不能通过偿债能力测试，IMF就会对其债券持有人施加足够规模的“剃头 ” （ haircut ） ， 以使其符合“高概率”标准从而能够得到IMF的援助。	But if a country fails the solvency test, it must impose a sufficiently deep haircut on its bondholders to bring it to the “high probability” standard needed to qualify for IMF assistance.
随着我们的社会变得越来越富裕，我们开始相信每个人都有资格获得某种最低标准，不管是在工作、生病或是失业问题上，从而使他们能够持续获得一定水平的安逸和成功。	As our societies have become richer, we have come to believe that everyone is entitled to a minimum standard, whether in work or sickness or unemployment, which allows for a continuing level of comfort and flourishing.
中国的领导人需要站出来并向焦躁不安的公众更清楚地阐明作为一个互相依存的世界上的成员所需具备的前景蓝图。	China’s leaders need to stand up and articulate more clearly to the country’s restive public this vision of membership in an interdependent world.
对全世界大部分国家来说，最大的挑战是确保2020年至少有90%的艾滋病毒阳性个体得到检测并了解自己被感染 — — 即第一个90。	For most of the world, the biggest challenge is ensuring that by 2020 at least 90% of HIV-positive individuals are tested and learn that they are infected – the first of the three 90s.
虽然必须实现跨境资本流动及汇率、利率市场化以保持经济增长，但是如果基准价格扭曲，这些改革将增加资产泡沫风险。	While cross-border capital flows and interest and exchange rates must be liberalized to maintain economic development, such reforms raise the risk of asset bubbles if implemented under distorted benchmark prices.
2006年召开的科尔多瓦峰会上，查韦斯和卡斯特罗大有比拼谁的讲话最长最漫无边际之势，峰会上弥漫着高涨的情绪。	At the 2006 summit in Córdoba, when Chávez and Fidel Castro dueled over who could deliver the longest and most rambling address, spirits were running high.
2013年鲁哈尼当选上台时，伊朗正遭遇35%的通胀，伊朗货币在此前一年中贬值了三分之二，还有国际制裁压得经济喘不过气来。	When Rouhani was elected in 2013, Iran was suffering from 35% inflation, the national currency had depreciated by two-thirds in the previous year, and international sanctions were crippling the economy.
不错，正是工薪阶层妇女和贫穷妇女的这种财务实用主义使得小额融资计划（把钱交到她们的手上）在发展中国家获得了成功。	Indeed, the financial pragmatism of working-class and poor women is the reason for the successes in the developing world of micro-financing that puts money in their hands.
分析结果显示如果印度拉贾斯坦邦要仿效其他邦豁免对两公顷以下土地所有者的正式贷款，那么付出的成本将达到1，174亿卢比（合17亿美元 ） 。	His analysis shows that if, for example, the Indian state of Rajasthan were to copy other states and waive formal loans for land holders with less than two hectares, this would cost 117.4 billion rupees ($1.7 billion).
疲软的增长、降低的通胀（拜油价进一步下跌所赐）和收紧的金融条件（通过美元升值、股市修正走势和信息利差扩大）正在威胁美国的增长和通胀预期。	Weaker growth, lower inflation (owing to a further decline in oil prices), and tighter financial conditions (via a stronger dollar, a corrected stock market, and wider credit spreads) now threaten US growth and inflation expectations.
更糟糕的是，特朗普要求，要“让双方平等 ” ， 中国得采购5,000万美元的美国产品 — — 否则就要征收关税，让未来美国开发商采购中国建筑材料变得更加昂贵。	Worse, Trump would demand that, to “even things out,” China purchase $50 million of US products – or face tariffs that make it more expensive for future US developers to purchase construction materials from China.
根据2009年和2012年国际学生评估计划（Program for International Student Assessment）的数据，上海十五岁年龄组学生在数学、科学和阅读能力方面表现在65个国家（其中包括34个经合组织国家）中名列前茅。	Fifteen-year-olds in Shanghai outperformed students from 65 countries, including 34 OECD countries, in mathematics, science, and reading, according to the Program for International Student Assessment in 2009 and 2012.
如今，决策者还必须将更多的注意力用于医疗工作人员本身，以确保医疗工作人员接受良好的教育和培训，应对地区所面临的挑战。	And now policymakers must also devote more attention to the health-care workforce itself, to ensure that it is properly educated and trained for the challenges that await the region.
不管最后的事实如何，这位巴西-黎巴嫩-法国混血执行官的职业生涯 — — 其中他执掌日产18年，执掌雷诺13年 — — 也将戛然而止。	Whatever facts eventually emerge, the Brazilian-Lebanese-French executive’s career, which included 18 years running Nissan and 13 years running Renault, has come to an abrupt end.
金融部门得到的补贴之巨令人咋舌，在现行政策下，补贴还将进一步增加 — — 这些补贴的首要作用是支持了最发达国家最高端1%人群的生活方式。	The extent of subsidies in this sector is stunning and, under current policies, will only increase over time – thereby primarily supporting the lifestyles of the top 1% of people in very rich countries.
通过解决疾病、饥饿和水污染等燃眉之急来打破贫困的循环不仅会明显地改善民生；它还能够增强人们对气候变化的应对能力。	Breaking the circle of poverty by addressing the most pressing issues of disease, hunger, and polluted water will not only do obvious good; it will also make people less vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
欧洲精英必须还原欧盟创立的指导原则，认识到我们对现实的理解具有先天性的不完美，而观念注定是有偏颇的，机构注定是有缺陷的。	The European elite needs to revert to the principles that guided the Union’s creation, recognizing that our understanding of reality is inherently imperfect, and that perceptions are bound to be biased and institutions flawed.
现在我们必须做的是为更加稳定的阿富汗、为在一个对全球稳定具有重大意义的地区的可持续的国际介入创造一个框架。	What we must do now is create the framework for a more stable Afghanistan, and for sustained international engagement in a region that is crucial for global stability.
另一方面，如果卡斯特罗真的没有前来，那么一些ALBA国家，包括两个哥伦比亚希望改善关系的邻国（厄瓜多尔和委内瑞拉）可能也不会来了。	If, on the other hand, Castro did not attend, some of the ALBA members, including two neighbors with which Colombia hopes to improve relations – Ecuador and Venezuela – might not show up, either.
这样一来，确保高风险债务不出篓子（2007—2008年金融危机的原因就在于此）就和银行管理者的个人财务利益绑在了一起。	As a result, bank managers would have a personal financial stake in ensuring that the risky obligations do not blow up, as they did during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
此外，罗姆尼信誓旦旦称要控告美国的第三大出口市场中国操纵汇率，并对中国进口产品征收高额的关税，这几乎肯定会招致中国方面的报复，从而损害美国的出口和就业。	Moreover, Romney’s promise to charge China, America’s third-largest export market, with currency manipulation, and to impose large tariffs on Chinese imports, would almost certainly invite retaliation, causing a decline in US exports and jobs.
这样做的结果是巨大的预算赤字，预算赤字在接下来的一年内，会在更多的衰退、银行救援以及短期财政刺激措施的压力下变得数额巨大（或许会到1万亿美元 ） 。	The result is a massive budget deficit, which will expand to gargantuan proportions in the coming year (perhaps $1 trillion) under the added weight of recession, bank bailouts, and short-term fiscal stimulus measures.
苏格兰也许会试图保持其自身货币与英镑的平价，但这需要比苏格兰中央银行所能拥有的更大的储备量，至少在一开始是如此。	Scotland might try to keep its currency at par with sterling, but this would require larger reserves than a Scottish central bank could command, at least at the outset.
在巴西，政府一直在削减其为数巨大的财政赤字，与此同时，其经济正从几十年来最深度的衰退中复苏（尽管最近缠上总统特梅尔的腐败丑闻可能令复苏中断 ） 。	In Brazil, the government has been cutting an enormous fiscal deficit just as the economy is recovering from its deepest recession in decades (though the corruption scandal now embroiling President Michel Temer may derail that effort).
高克的演讲反映了一篇重要新报告道中的思想。 这篇报告由政治和科学基金会（Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik）以及美国德国马歇尔基金会（German Marshall Fund of the United States ） ， 题目是《新大国、新责任 》 （ New Power, New Responsibility ） 。	Gauck’s speech reflected the thinking in an important new report, entitled New Power, New Responsibility, released by the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik and the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
新德里—全世界金融领导人正准备齐聚华盛顿参加国际货币基金组织（IMF）春季年会，他们的希望 — — 以及恐惧 — — 都集中在中国身上。	NEW DELHI – As the world’s financial leaders gather in Washington, DC, for the annual spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund, their hopes – and fears – center on China.
自由的市场经济和法律传统对于金融中心的生存不可或缺，当然帮助它们崛起，但是最初的崛起总是历史演变，而不是政府的战略打造出来的。	A free-market economy and its legal traditions -- both indispensable to the survival of financial centers – certainly helps them to rise, but that initial rise has always been attributable to historical evolution, not government strategy.
我的选择是让它更加直言不讳地解释为何要继续等待 ： “ 摆脱零利率底限是很难的，我们希望等到通胀率超过3％以最终确认，然后我们会采取合理的行动速度来恢复正常化 。 ”	My choice would be to have it explain the case for waiting more forthrightly: “Getting off the zero bound is hard, we want to see inflation over 3% to be absolutely sure, and then we will move with reasonable speed to normalize.”
这个方案－在最近的欧盟理事会上被作为谈判的基础通过－总体上允许一些成员国可以不履行它们按理应当履行的京都议定书排放量分担目标。	This approach – endorsed as a basis for negotiation in the recent EU Council – amounted to allowing some member states not to fulfill their supposedly binding Kyoto burden-sharing targets.
但接下来，在埃维昂的那个月中，尽管许多欧洲代表团对于德国和奥地利犹太人所经受的折磨表示诚挚的哀悼，但并不准备采取实质行动。	And yet in Évian the following month, although many European delegations voiced eloquent dismay over the torment experienced by the Jews of Germany and Austria, they were unprepared to take concrete action.
与此同时，美国和其它在阿富汗有利益关系的大国，必须设法减少印度在阿富汗的活动，这些活动被巴基斯坦视为对他们的威胁。 若这些政策没有威胁作用，也要确保其有更大的透明度。	At the same time, the US and other powers with a stake in Afghanistan must seek to reduce Indian activities in Afghanistan that Pakistan sees as threatening, or, if those policies are not threatening, assure greater transparency for them.
在2008年危机爆发前，中低收入增长完全来自经济中的不可贸易部门，该部门大约要占发达国家产出和就业的三分之二。	Until the crisis of 2008, middle- and lower-income job growth occurred entirely in the non-tradable sector of the economy, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of advanced countries’ output and employment.
他明白，领导岗位通常根据个人关系而非能力分配，并且是终身制，整套体制因为效率低下、不愿冒险、缺乏专业能力而举步维艰。	With leadership positions allocated – often for life – on the basis of personal connections, rather than merit, he understood that the system suffered from gross inefficiency, risk aversion, and a lack of technical expertise.
近几十年来，随着预期寿命的延长以及二战后婴儿潮一代开始为退休而储蓄，金融资产相对任何经济活动指标都大幅扩张。	In recent decades, financial assets have expanded dramatically relative to any measure of economic activity, as life expectancy increased and the post-WWII baby boomers began to think about saving for retirement.
事实上，57个国家 — — 包括法国、德国和英国等主要大国 — — 已经加入亚投行并成为创始成员国，这或许反映出越来越多的人认识到美国主导的秩序回报正在下降。	In fact, 57 countries – including major powers like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom – have signed up as founding members, which may reflect a growing awareness of the US-dominated order’s diminishing returns.
基欧汉的核心洞见是，国际货币基金组织（IMF ） 、 世界卫生组织等机构，甚至G20这样的临时性安排，它们在成立时也许需要有一个明确的领导者，但保持运行未必需要。	Keohane’s core insight was that the creation of institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization, and even ad hoc institutions like the G20 may require a clear leader, but running them may not.
我对20世纪80年代末仍然记忆犹新，这不仅是因为那时对自由的期待，而且因为对我刚出生的女儿来说，一点儿婴儿食品都没有。	I remember the late 1980’s not only for its hopes for freedom, but also for a total absence of baby food for my newborn daughter.
我所听到的最好的解释 — — 尽管仍不够充分，也只是个假说 — — 是，这契合了我们的认知偏见，因为它告诉了我们想听的东西。	The best – albeit inadequate and highly tentative – explanation that I have heard is that it fits with our cognitive biases, because it tells us what we want to hear.
即使众议院真的弹劾特朗普 — — 能不能弹劾现在还根本无法确定 — — 要想在参议院将他定罪也将是极其困难的。	Even if the House were to impeach Trump – no sure thing – convicting him in the Senate would be extremely difficult.
2014年4月，时任美国国务卿克里告诉美国国会，以巴直接对话因为以色列宣布要为约旦河西岸的以色列人建立700个新住宅单位而“戛然而止 ” 。	In April 2014, then-US Secretary of State John Kerry told the US Congress that direct talks between Israel and Palestine went “poof” when Israel announced 700 new housing units for Israelis in the West Bank.
在我的书《资本主义4.0 》 （ Capitalism 4.0）中我指出，2008年危机所预兆的第四次全球资本主义系统性崩溃之后也将发生可比的政治剧变。	In my book Capitalism 4.0, I argued that comparable political upheavals would follow the fourth systemic breakdown of global capitalism heralded by the 2008 crisis.
防止卡扎菲重建在突尼斯和埃及已经倒塌的恐惧之墙是防止已经到来的“阿拉伯春天”继之以不满的严冬的关键因素。	Preventing Qaddafi from rebuilding the wall of fear that fell in Tunisia and Egypt is essential if the “Arab spring” is not to be succeeded by a new winter of discontent.
如果托宾税能促使金融机构更多地用长期债务、更少地用隔夜回购来为自己融资，那么可以起到重要的稳定作用。	If a Tobin tax induced financial institutions to finance themselves with more longer-term debt and less overnight repo, it could play a significant stabilizing role.
对于这个情况，日本在1990年代那个所谓“失落的十年”也是有类似经验的，当时日本的预算赤字在全国资产泡沫爆破后急剧膨胀，导致经济发展陷入停滞。	Japan had a similar experience in the 1990’s, the country’s so-called “lost decade.” At that time, Japan’s budget deficit soared after the country’s property bubble burst, causing economic stagnation.
现在，我们可以确定，在前苏联领土范围内并不存在什么全球威胁，但来自伊朗和朝鲜这些国家的危险挑战却是切实存在的。	To be sure, there is no global threat on the scale of the former Soviet Union, but there are dangerous challenges emanating from such countries as Iran and North Korea.
对于中国这样的“赶超”国家，快速增长通常伴随着活跃的结构性变化，促使生产要素（特别是劳动力）从低生产率部门向高生产率部门转移。	For “catch-up” countries, like China, rapid growth is often accompanied by brisk structural change that moves factors of production, especially labor, from low-productivity activities to economic sectors with much higher productivity.
美国在世界各地的盟友惊异地注视着最近因提高联邦政府债务上限而引发的口水战，他们惊讶于美国国会无法达成任何均衡而具前瞻性的折衷协议。	America’s friends around the world watched with dismay the recent brawl in over raising the federal government’s debt ceiling, and the US Congress’s inability to come to anything like a balanced and forward-looking compromise.
如果从现在开始到2015年采取循序渐进的方式，把中等教育向每个儿童普及的花费将有可能以每年270亿美元至340美元的速度增加。	If a gradual approach is taken between now and 2015, the annual additional cost of extending secondary education to every child will likely be between $27 billion and $34 billion.
因为最大的机会在于通过采纳和推广今天的最佳做法以推动快速的生产力赶超，政治家们必须继续推动削减贸易和监管障碍，以促进市场一体化和竞争。	Because the biggest opportunities lie in spurring faster productivity catch-up by adopting and diffusing today’s best practices, politicians must keep pushing to reduce trade and regulatory barriers to market integration and competition.
但《第六修正案》却��不适用于关塔纳摩的囚犯，因为他们不是美国公民，并且被关押在从技术上讲并非位于美国领土的设施里，虽然这一设施完全在美国政府的控制之下。	But the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the Guantánamo prisoners, because they are not US citizens and are in a facility that, technically, is not part of US territory, although it is under the full control of the US government.
1945年岸信介以战犯身份被美国人囚禁，冷战开始后未经审判即被释放，并于1957年以保守党身份当选首相。	Imprisoned by the Americans as a war criminal in 1945, Kishi was released without trial at the beginning of the Cold War, and was elected Prime Minister as a conservative in 1957.
而在没有中国参与的情况下商讨这些规章可被视为是旨在最终诱使中国进入一个自由化全球体系的某一部分策略。	Negotiating these rules without China’s participation can be viewed as part of a strategy aimed at eventually coaxing China into a liberal global system.
食品与燃料价格的飚升与主要自然灾难在很多方面都起到了重要的影响，如破坏金融市场与居民的购买能力，甚至是破坏了政治的稳定。	Soaring food and fuel prices and major natural disasters played an important role in undermining financial markets, household purchasing power, and even political stability.
此外，精英控制组以治疗为重点的研究已经找到了病毒变异较小区域的线索，该结果可以在很大程度上帮助疫苗研究者。	Meanwhile, cure-focused studies of elite controllers are yielding clues about regions of the virus that mutate less, which could hold important lessons for vaccine researchers.
最近，大毒枭“矮子”华金·古兹曼（Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman）从一间墨西哥监狱中越狱，凸显出边境墙的另一个弱点：地道。	The recent escape of the drug cartel leader Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman from a Mexican prison highlights another vulnerability of border walls: tunnels.
看到成千上万的人参与这场辩论是一个振奋人心的事情，因为如果没有大众的参与，安全就是难以界定的问题，而那些迫在眉睫的重要改革也会缺乏政治合法性。	It is encouraging to see that many thousands are indeed getting involved, because without popular engagement, security will remain undefined, and the important reforms that are needed will lack political legitimacy.
首先，朝鲜政府威胁如果联合国不撤销其关于在国际刑事法院起诉朝鲜领导人反人类罪的建议，朝鲜就要进行更多的核试验。	First, the regime threatened to conduct more nuclear tests if the United Nations does not withdraw its recommendation to prosecute the country’s leaders for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court.
对大批避难者的应对要求欧盟加强其提供短期保护的能力 — — 或者需要对整个避难系统的运作进行重新检讨。	Dealing with any surge of asylum seekers will require the EU to strengthen its capacity to offer temporary protection – and possibly to reconsider how its overall asylum system works.
即使唐纳德·特朗普当选总统的噩梦被成功避免 — — 这种可能性越来越大 — — 美国也不再能够成为世界警察。	Even if the nightmare of a President Donald Trump is avoided, as appears increasingly likely, the United States can no longer be the world’s policeman.
这也许是当今世界最重要的挑战之一，因为如果我们希望全球稳定，美国人所掌握的独一无二的权力就需要被看作¾并且用作¾一种正义的力量。	This is probably one of the most important challenges for today’s world, for America retains a unique power that should be used – and be perceived – as a force for good if global stability is to prevail.
而且，奥巴马还利用经济危机的机会，做成了多年以来一直没有的做成的事情：将8国集团扩充到20国集团，在其中增加了一些主要的新兴市场国家。	Moreover, Obama used the crisis to accomplish what many had suggested for years: transform the G-8 into a broader institutional framework of a G-20 that includes the major emerging economies.
所以，不幸的是，即便欧洲即时醒悟，且新兴市场国家也对自由贸易抱有更大的热情，我们或许还是不能指望在未来十年里会达成大宗的全球性贸易协议。	So, unfortunately, even if Europe came to its senses and emerging markets showed greater enthusiasm for liberal trade, we may not see a big global deal until the next decade.
在德国，对两代中产阶级债券持有人的剥夺被看作是德国皇帝战争以及随后希特勒战争所导致的恶果 — — 换言之，这意味着民主制度的失败。	In Germany, the expropriation of two generations of middle-class bond holders was seen as the outcome of the Kaiser’s war, and then of Hitler’s war – in other words, a result of democratic failure.
同样，OMO语言学习可以将远程授课的国外教师、协助维持课堂气氛的本地助教，纠正发音的自主软件以及批改作业和考试的自主硬件结合在一起。	Similarly, OMO language learning will combine native teachers lecturing remotely, local assistants keeping the atmosphere fun, autonomous software correcting pronunciation, and autonomous hardware grading homework and tests.
比方说，在1990到2010年间年均降低5.6%之后，叙利亚的婴儿死亡率近年来已经增长了9.3 % 。	For example, after declining at an average annual rate of 5.6% between 1990 and 2010, Syria’s infant mortality rate has risen by 9.3% in recent years.
拉托诺夫自认为是一个诚实的无产阶级作家，是一名共产主义者，却被斯大林，红色政权的小丑，称为 “ svoloc ” （ 恶棍）和“balagancik ” （ 小丑 ） ， 一生受尽折磨。	A communist who considered himself an honest proletarian writer, but called by Stalin, the Red Clown of Power, “svoloc” (scoundrel) and “balagancik” (buffoon), Platonov lived a lifelong ordeal.
在这个例子中，这份威胁导致发布者被捕 — — 很多人希望这样的结果能够阻止社交媒体“直男癌”继续发出这样的威胁。	In that case, the threat led to the arrest of its issuer – an outcome that many hope will discourage future such threats from social-media misogynists.
此外，上述各国之间及其与美国间均签署了双边自由贸易协定（尽管官方名称为《美国哥伦比亚贸易促进协定》的议案尚待美国国会批准 ） 。	Moreover, each of the countries has bilateral free-trade agreements with the others and with the United States (though the US Congress has yet to approve the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, as it is officially known).
石油输出国必须进一步提高它们的财政支出；日本和欧元地区必须通过结构改革刺激经济更快地增长；而美国必须实施具体的措施以保持更高的储蓄。	Oil exporters must increase fiscal spending further; Japan and the Euro area must trigger higher growth through structural reforms; and the US must implement concrete measures to sustain higher savings.
但即使是当前贸易规则所允许的过度保护主义的反倾销措施，也没有对贸易造成过度伤害，同时又为政治压力提供了安全阀。	Yet even the overtly protectionist anti-dumping measures allowed under existing trade rules have not been overly damaging to trade, while providing an escape valve for political pressure.
对于欧洲企业来说尤其如此，其股东的利益，而非政府的政治诡计，才是决定二级制裁（secondary sanctions）的结果的因素。	This is especially true of European firms, which will ultimately decide the outcome of the battle for secondary sanctions in cognizance of their shareholders’ interests, rather than the political machinations of their governments.
并且事实上，在新生欧洲经济共同体内部开放国界的1957年罗马条约促使欧洲内部贸易迅速扩大，从而促成了经济的共同复苏。	And, indeed, the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which opened national borders within the new European Economic Community, enabled the rapid proliferation of intra-European trade, thereby contributing to a shared economic recovery.
新任外交部长扎里夫（Javad Zarif）在所有参与谈判的国家领导人中间拥有极高的知名度和尊敬度，他将在任何谈判中起到重要作用。	The new foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, is well known and respected by the leaders of all of the countries participating in the negotiations, and he will assume important responsibilities in any talks that take place.
50多年来，人类时时刻刻都在战战兢兢地看着性命之所系的发丝，而政客却在为如何修复发丝的磨损而吵个不可开交。	For more than 50 years, humanity has warily eyed that lethal pendulum while statesmen debated how to mend its fraying cords.
现在这种资本流入的突然中断对于这些国家肯定是一个沉重打击，并且使它们面临着一个单靠自己无法解决的特殊挑战。	A sudden stop to such flows is a severe blow and raises special challenges that cannot be solved by these countries alone.
随着克里米亚投票无论以何种标准衡量都以非法方式脱离乌克兰加入俄联邦，以欧盟为代表的国际社会宣布拒绝接受这一结果。	With the vote to leave Ukraine and join the Russian Federation illegal by any reckoning, the international community, as the EU has declared, cannot accept the outcome.
长期以来，委员会成员谁对加息投了赞成票，谁投了反对票都会被及早披露，可谓高度透明。 然而，恰恰是这种透明度，使得公众能够把委员会成员某些归入鹰派，某些归入鸽派。	But, from an early stage, the transparency that resulted from the early publication of who voted for and against rate increases led to a public identification of members of the Committee as hawks or doves.
但是，人们有理由要问什么时候才能对非洲非人的贫困给出一个可持续的解决方案，不仅仅是依靠八国领导人和“Live 8”世界群星扶贫义演音乐会的组织者，而且要同样依靠非洲的领导人和及其人民。	But it is fair to ask when a sustainable solution to Africa’s dehumanizing poverty will be found, not only by the G8 and the organizers of Live 8, but also by Africa’s leaders and people.
这两次投票是《 2005 年全面和平协定》的关键要素，由此结束了南方和北方之间长达 20 年的内战。	A referendum on the future status of the south of the country is supposed to follow in 2011. Both were key ingredients of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended 20 years of civil war between north and south.
类似地，1979年伊朗革命后，美国武装了萨达姆·侯赛因的伊拉克，让其与伊朗开战，造成20世纪80年代数十万伊朗人死亡。	Likewise, following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the US armed Saddam Hussein’s Iraq to go to war with Iran, resulting in hundreds of thousands of Iranian deaths in the 1980s.
自独立以来的50年里，有724万个工作被创造出来，增长率为261 % ， 约等于在美国创造了1.05亿份工作。	In the 50 years since independence, 7.24 million jobs have been created, an increase of 261%, which would be equivalent to the creation of 105 million jobs in the United States.
这一立法非但没有通过扩大所得税抵免来鼓励就业，而是在美国历史上第一次对员工收入征收高于企业主和合伙人收入的税收。	Instead of expanding the earned income tax credit to encourage work, the legislation will, for the first time in American history, impose a higher tax rate on employment income than on income earned by proprietors and partnerships.
压垮“全球化是导致欧洲民粹主义上升原因”的最后一根稻草是低技术工人（指没有完成中学教育的工人）占比正在快速下降。	The final nail in the coffin of the globalization-based explanation for the rise of populism in Europe is the fact that the share of low-skill workers (who have not completed a secondary education) is declining rapidly.
而当庄稼成熟后，农民又面临着如何将它们运到市场上的重大障碍 — — 包括农村道路系统不完善以及缺乏冷藏设施。	And, when the crops are ready, farmers face major obstacles – including inadequate rural road systems and a lack of cold storage facilities – in delivering them to the market.
85年前，美国参议员里德·史穆特（Reed Smoot）和众议员威利斯·哈雷（Willis Hawley）打响了第一枪，炮制了1930年关税法案。	More than 85 years ago, US Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis Hawley fired the first shot in sponsoring the Tariff Act of 1930.
类似地，在叙利亚，雇佣兵让克里姆林宫可以将俄罗斯的介入和损失轻描淡写 — — 许多观察家预测，从俄罗斯干预开始到现在，人员损失已经非常巨大。	Similarly, in Syria, mercenaries enable the Kremlin to downplay Russia’s involvement, as well as its losses, which many observers predicted, from the outset of its intervention, would be staggeringly high.
为了缓冲因为石油价格回落而对经济造成的影响，俄罗斯设立了政府储备基金，该基金拥有1400亿美元资金；主要是为了解决将来的养老金危机的国民福利基金，拥有300亿美元的资金。	The government’s Reserve Fund, created to cushion the economy from a fall in oil prices, stands at $140 billion, and the National Welfare Fund, intended mainly to solve the coming pension crisis, holds another $30 billion.
视频可以设计成模块，以便让学校使用（比如）一个课程包来教授课程的第一部分，而用完全不同的另一个课程包来教授第二部分。	And videos could be used in modules, so a school could choose to use, say, one package to teach the first part of a course, and a completely different package to teach the second part.
原教旨主义的伊朗威胁论并不客观地描述中东的实际政治形势，而是被用来继续无条件支持日益风雨飘摇的政权。	Rather than objectively describing the actual political situation in the Middle East, the notion of a fundamental Iranian threat is being used to continue unconditional Western support for increasingly unstable regimes.
特朗普和习近平必须找到办法化解朝鲜半岛的危机 — — 或者在外交努力失败、战争爆发的情况下，做好后果管理。	Trump and Xi must find a way to defuse the looming crisis on the Korean Peninsula – or manage the consequences should diplomacy fail and war erupt.
发自伯克莱 — — 在他们颇具说服力的新书《第二次机器时代》中，埃里克·布仑乔尔森和安德鲁·麦卡菲记录了人工智能在协助电脑超越自身已有技能方面的进展。	BERKELEY – In their compelling new book The Second Machine Age, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee document the progress in artificial intelligence that is enabling computers to exceed what they were capable of only a few years ago.
世界银行的一份研究发现，营养不良所造成的成本最多相当于一个人一生潜在收入10 % ， 或一国GDP的3 % 。	A World Bank study found that under-nutrition can cost an individual up to 10% of his or her potential lifetime earnings, and as much as 3% of a country’s GDP.
发自巴黎 — — 在欧洲各国的23支海军中，只有法国拥有一艘可以执行全部任务的航空母舰：排水量4万吨的旗舰夏尔·戴高乐号。	PARIS – Of Europe’s 23 naval forces, only France’s possesses a fully operational aircraft carrier, the 40,000-ton flagship Charles de Gaulle.
吉拉尼在他的就职演说中明白地宣布打击恐怖主义是国家的首要任务，他的第一个决定就是释放被穆沙拉夫软禁的法官。	Gilani unequivocally declared in his inaugural address that fighting terrorism is a top priority, and his first decision was to release from house arrest judges deposed by Musharraf.
但使用大数据创造更好社会的最大困难是发展人体尺度的对社会物理学（social physics）的直观理解。	But the biggest difficulty in using big data to build a better society is being able to develop a human-scale, intuitive understanding of social physics.
对该项税收封顶可以防止税率不断上升，但带宽的增长会导致大部分用户很快就必须缴税，不但影响到最贫困消费者，也影响到新企业和小企业。	The cap on such a tax would prevent the rate from spiraling upward, but rising bandwidths would cause most users to max out quickly, affecting not only the poorest consumers, but also new or small businesses.
如果当前计划燃煤发电站全部建成并按通常的服役年限40年生产，那么光是这些煤电站就将排放2,400亿吨二氧化碳 — — 远远多于剩余碳预算。	If all currently planned coal-fired power plants are built and operated over their normal service life of 40 years, they alone would emit 240 billion tons of CO2 – more than the remaining carbon budget.
约有2，000万穆斯林，多数是逊尼派，在俄罗斯联邦境内生活，据该国安全官员报告，来自前苏联加盟共和国和俄罗斯的大约7，000名武装人员已经加入了伊斯兰国。	Around 20 million Muslims, most of them Sunni, live within the Russian Federation, and the country’s security officials report that some 7,000 fighters from the former Soviet republics and Russia have joined the Islamic State.
在平常的年份，没有人会反对女王贝娅特丽克丝去年圣诞节的讲话。 当时，她呼吁宽容并且“尊重少数人群 ” 。	In less feverish times than these, no one could possibly have taken exception to Queen Beatrix’s speech last Christmas, when she pleaded for tolerance and “respect for minorities.”
他们不仅忠诚于选他们做领导人的公民，也忠诚于经受了法德仇恨后果的先人和将从妥协中获益的尚未来到世上的后代。	Their loyalty was not only to the citizens who elected them, but also to the generations of the past that had endured the consequences of Franco-German enmity, and to generations yet to come, which would benefit from reconciliation.
分子生物学是解决卫生、环境和食品问题（就像人们在肯尼亚所看到的）的良方，问题在于决策者是否做好了使用准备。	GM foods have now been on the market in the US for more than 12 years. Most of the food consumed by Americans is either genetically modified or exposed to genetic modification somewhere in the production process.
事实可能会证明阻碍今天环保工作的短期思维具有毁灭性效果；事实上，在某种程度上，上述毁灭性效果已经体现得日益显著。	The short-term thinking that impedes environmental conservation efforts today could prove devastating; indeed, to some extent, it already has.
发自普林斯顿 — — 近几个月以来印度卢比汇率迅速走弱，自五月初以来，其对美元汇率下跌了11 % ， 约为1美元对60卢比。	PRINCETON – The Indian rupee has weakened rapidly in recent months, with the exchange rate against the US dollar dropping by 11%, to around 60 rupees, since early May.
这种冲击可能来自于国内，而且会以不同形式出现，例如卷土重来的通胀或美国总统特朗普也已发动的贸易战持续升级。	That shock could be homegrown, coming in the form, say, of renewed inflation or of the continued escalation of the trade war that US President Donald Trump has started.
当然，1990年代和平进程的失败，以及随后发生的第二次占领区巴勒斯坦人暴动似乎都加剧了以色列内部激进派的极端程度并打击了温和派。	Certainly, the failure of the peace process in the 1990’s, followed by the coming of the second Intifada, appears to have encouraged the radicalization of Israel’s extremes while discouraging moderates.
氢气（比如）可以通过升级生物燃料转换为液体燃料，也可以与废气中的二氧化碳反应或经过处理生产液体燃料用于运输。	The hydrogen could be converted into a liquid fuel by upgrading biofuels, for example, or it could be reacted with carbon dioxide from flue gas or otherwise processed to produce liquid fuels for use in transportation applications.
不管特朗普如何忙于准备入主白宫 — — 遴选内阁、给他的诸多承诺排定顺序 — — 他都不能忽视这一风险。	However busy Trump is planning the transition to the White House – selecting his cabinet and prioritizing his many promises – he must not ignore this risk.
但从英国自身的经历所得到的教训就是：唯一能够实现繁荣的方式 — — 即所谓赢得“全球竞赛 ” — —正是直面问题并着手应对它。	But the lesson from the British experience is that the only way to deliver prosperity – to win the so-called “global race” – is by tackling problems head-on.
最后，我们不能忽视悬而未决的以巴冲突的破坏力，它仍在助长政治极端主义、滋生严重威胁西方人权承诺的问题。	Finally, we should not ignore the continuing toxicity of the unresolved Israel-Palestine conflict, which continues to feed political extremism and raises serious questions about the West’s commitment to human rights.
所以，查韦斯所谓“玻利瓦尔革命”的推广和强化不符合巴西的利益。 尽管卢拉总统麾下的某些官员似乎是查韦斯及其政府的崇拜者。	So the spread and strengthening of Chávez’s so-called Bolivarian Revolution was not in Brazil’s interests, even though some of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s officials appear to be fans of Chávez and his administration.
这种风险，加之特朗普越来越奇特的行为，已经导致华盛顿的紧张情绪超过包括水门事件那段黑暗时期在内的以往任何时候。	That risk, coupled with Trump’s increasingly peculiar behavior, has made Washington more tense than I’ve ever known it to be, and that includes the dark days of Watergate.
此外，非西方国家 — — 其中包括中国和印度等大型消费国以及海湾国家和俄罗斯等大型生产国 — — 不信任主要由西方国家设置的国际体系。	Moreover, non-Western countries – which include big consumers like China and India, and the largest producers (the Gulf states and Russia) – don’t trust the institutional system created mainly by the West.
由于死牛气田的天然气远远超过了阿根廷本国的需求量，出口将是不可避免的，��相邻的巴西和智利则是天然客户。	Because Vaca Muerta holds much more gas than Argentina could ever burn, exports are the inescapable way forward, and neighboring Brazil and Chile are among the natural customers.
当普京总统以及他的前克格勃刻板的同僚们决定在多大程度上挤压俄罗斯的后共产时代的邻国时，将不必再担心西欧了。	President Vladimir Putin and his administration of ex-KGB clones will no longer have to worry about Western Europe when deciding how hard to squeeze Russia’s postcommunist neighbors.
在我的书《非理性繁荣 》 （ Irrational Exuberance）第二版中，我尝试给泡沫下一个更好的定义。	In the second edition of my book Irrational Exuberance, I tried to give a better definition of a bubble.
其次，央行可以在量化和信贷宽松的同时，回归负利率，欧洲央行、日本银行、瑞士国民银行和其他一些央行在最近几年中就是这么做的。	Second, central banks could return to negative policy rates, as the ECB, BOJ, SNB, and some other central banks have done, in addition to quantitative and credit easing, in recent years.
即使合理地估计了来自经济增长的税收收入增量，他仍然需要通过控制支出，特别是福利支出与其减税计划匹配。	If properly scored to account for increased tax revenue from economic growth, he would still need to pair his tax cuts with controls on spending, and especially on entitlements.
患有慢性病的人最终的死亡原因并不只有这些疾病，还有其他因素 — — 包括其他NCD、急性传染病以及受伤。	People living with a chronic disease may die not only from that disease, but also from other causes – including other NCDs, acute infections, and injuries.
新隐私规则必须保护公民、允许创新；与此同时，关于强制性数据局域化和局域“互联网”的要求应该受到抵制。	New privacy rules must protect citizens and allow innovation; calls for mandatory data localization and local versions of the “Internet” must be resisted.
他们的身体可能会出现防御反应，通过改变下几代的基因实现短期适应，或者在“危险”过去之前，所谓的“软遗传”和反应较慢的进化力量一起起着作用。	Their bodies probably reacted defensively, adapting in the short term by changing the genes for the next few generations, or until the “danger” had passed, a so-called “soft inheritance” running in parallel to slower-acting evolutionary forces.
但以色列方面却仍未公开答应美国和巴勒斯坦关于停止在耶路撒冷兴建犹太人定居点的要求，而此项要求是在美国副总统乔·拜登最近的以色列之行中敲定的。	But Israel has not publicly agreed to the American and Palestinian request to rescind the settlement construction in Jerusalem approved during US Vice President Joe Biden’s recent visit to Israel.
剑桥 — — 美国总统唐纳德·特朗普终于以新的美墨加协定取代了被称为“有史以来最糟贸易协定”的北美自由贸易协定，他的表现就好像取得了一场压倒性的胜利。	CAMBRIDGE – US President Donald Trump acts as if he has pulled off a smashing victory by replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) – supposedly “the worst trade deal ever” – with the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
但在私有部门专业人士被解雇或因业绩不佳而遭降薪的时候，任却希望拿到私有部门的薪酬，而不承担私有部门的风险。	But, whereas private-sector professionals are fired or have their salaries reduced for poor performance, Yam wanted private-sector pay with none of the downside risk.
讨论的主题是“全球化与伦理学 ” — —具体而言，是对欧洲、美国和亚洲保护弱势社会成员的方式做一个比较。	The subject was “Globalization and Ethics” – specifically, a comparison of the ways that Europe, the United States and Asia protect the most fragile members of their respective societies.
根据我和卡门·莱因哈特对历史发生上的已经金融危机研究后得出的结果：在金融危机发生后的三年中，即使除去通货膨胀的因素，国债也会翻倍。	In research that Carmen Reinhart and I have done on the history of financial crises, we find that public debt typically doubles, even adjusting for inflation, in the three years following a crisis.
有时，国内政策会推动经济转型和减贫，就像中国大规模实现的那样，不但让本国经济受益，也让全世界消费者受益。	At other times, they will propel economic transformation and poverty reduction, as they have done on a massive scale in China, generating gains not just for the home economy but also for consumers worldwide.
考虑到即使是国际货币基金组织（IMF）也没有跳出德国认定的正统的窠臼，奥巴马对欧洲的思想偏隘（intellectual insularity）的决裂就更加引人注目了。	Obama’s breach of Europe’s intellectual insularity is all the more remarkable because even the International Monetary Fund has acquiesced in German-imposed orthodoxy.
过去十年来，独立于医药行业的药品获取基金会已经发布了一份备受推崇的药品获取指数，该指数特别适合量化各家企业在针对抗菌素耐药性斗争中所完成的工作。	For the past ten years, the AMF, which is independent of the pharmaceutical industry, has published a highly regarded Access to Medicine Index, making it uniquely suited to quantify how various companies measure up in the fight against AMR.
但是，尽管一些久负盛名的报纸 — — 如《纽约时报 》 、 《华盛顿邮报》和英国的《卫报 》 — —的网络版表现出色，并不足以扭转颓势。	Yet, while some well-known newspapers – such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the United Kingdom-based Guardian – have developed a robust Internet presence themselves, it is not enough.
不过，讽刺的是，布雷顿森林体系的终结并没有动摇美元在国际上的主导地位，实际上反而增加了美元在世界范围的使用。	Ironically, however, rather than undermining the predominant international role of the US dollar, the end of Bretton Woods actually boosted its use around the world.
“你开口说‘以上帝的名义 ’ … 时，我看见一道光闪过，包围了你，一直保护着你，直到（演讲）结束 。 ”	“When you began with the words ‘In the name of God’… I saw a light coming, surrounding you and protecting you to the end [of the speech].”
相反，他们一直在忙于构建一个有无限可能的幻想世界，这个世界的基础，是以1940年德雷克爵士（Sir Francis Drake ） 、 罗利爵士（Sir Walter Raleigh ） 、 英属印度和保持“独行”为特色的国家神话。	Instead, they have been busy constructing a fanciful world of limitless possibility, based on a national mythology featuring Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, the British Raj, and standing “alone” in 1940.
意大利众多的工会，雇主联合会，所有的反对党，甚至连贝卢斯科尼旗下的许多议员都已经联合起来，共同反对这个在他们看来有点神经不正常的提案。	The trade unions, employers’ associations, all opposition political parties, and even many of Berlusconi’s own MPs have united against what they consider to be an aberration.
在印度，每年有1,300万儿童无法参与轮状病毒接种计划；在巴基斯坦，每年有500万儿童无法获得接种。	In India, 13 million children annually are not reached with the rotavirus initiative; in Pakistan, five million children annually are not vaccinated.
但是最近媒体炒作的问题在于，某些人似乎相信，如果不能展示比人类从前所考虑的更为严重的后果和更为恐怖的灾难，新的报告或者进展就无济于事。	But the problem with the recent media frenzy is that some seem to believe no new report or development is enough if it doesn’t reveal more serious consequences and more terrifying calamities than humanity has ever considered before.
延长该计划的制定流程将适得其反，刺激大量受人关注的关于新欧洲（不论是否包括英国）应该是一副什么样子的讨论。	Prolonging the plan’s development process would have the opposite effect, by helping to spur a broad – and attentive – discussion on what the new Europe, with or without the UK, should look like.
所有这些都削弱了政府政策的效率 — — 损害了政策的信誉、堵住了政策向经济的传播渠道、增加了抵消私人部门资本和支出减少的难度。	All of this serves to undermine the effectiveness of government policies – by reducing their credibility, clogging their channels of transmission to the economy, and making it difficult to offset the withdrawal of private-sector capital and spending.
这一立场已经付出了一个沉重的代价：如能有一个更具竞争性的理念市场，那个有缺陷的华盛顿共识可能永远都不会成为一个共识。	This position has already exacted a heavy price: had there been a more competitive marketplace of ideas, the flawed Washington Consensus might never have become a consensus at all.
麦肯锡全球研究所（MGI）2015年的一份报告发现，如果女性和男性在“劳动力市场中扮演相同角色 ” ， 那么到2025年，全球经济能够增加28万亿美元规模。	A 2015 report by the McKinsey Global Institute found that if women and men played an “identical role in labor markets,” $28 trillion would be added to the global economy by 2025.
欧洲央行行长让-克劳德·特里谢深知这一点：在1990年代初，时任法国央行行长的他就应对过类似的危机。	European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet is well aware of this: in the early 1990’s, he confronted such a crisis as Governor of the Bank of France.
北京—金融抑制 — — 即通过政府政策创造一种低甚至负实际利率环境，以此为公共支出营造廉价融资 — — 是中国经济政策的长期重要特征。	BEIJING – Financial repression – government policies that create an environment of low or negative real interest rates, with the goal of generating cheap financing for public spending – has long been a key feature of Chinese economic policy.
同样， 那些使用“波兰死亡集中营”一词的人，包括前美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马和前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米，其实都对波兰没有恶意。	Similarly, virtually no one who uses the phrase “Polish death camps” – including former US President Barack Obama and former FBI Director James Comey – does so out of ill will toward Poland.
如果没有这次导弹发射，金氏王朝对权力的把控几乎肯定会因金正恩的年轻和经验不足而逐渐削弱，从而导致朝鲜局势陷入混乱之中。	Without it, the Kim dynasty’s hold on power would almost certainly weaken, given Kim Jong-un’s youth and inexperience, plunging the country into chaos.
在阿拉伯领导人的强力支持下，约旦国王阿卜杜拉二世正式提出了这项由阿拉伯联盟和伊斯兰国家组织设计的和平计划。	Empowered by Arab leaders, Jordan’s King Abdullah II officially presented the peace plan devised by the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic States.
世界上没有哪个地区比欧洲从跨国银行业务中获得更多的好处，如今，这些成就陷入了危机，各大欧洲银行集团本身也随之岌岌可危。	No region of the world has benefited more from cross-border banking, yet these achievements are now at risk – and with them the European bank groups themselves.
如果小农业生产者能借助基本的基础设施来将自己的产品送往市场的话，他们将不仅能养活自己以及社区，还能为更大范围内的粮食安全做出贡献。	If smallholder farmers have the basic infrastructure they need to get their goods to market, they will not only be able to feed themselves and their communities, but will contribute to wider food security.
我保证会用我的余生来支持自由思想和表达、学术自由以及保护少数族裔和少数看法 — — 我这样做不仅会是在我的祖国匈牙利，而且会是在世界各国。	I pledge to devote the remaining years of my life to supporting free thought and expression, academic freedom, and the protection of minorities and minority opinions – not only in my native Hungary, but all over the world.
最后但同样重要的是，一些心理学家和神经学家 — — 其中最著名的是伦敦大学学院的塔丽·沙罗特 — — 认为人脑的天性是乐观的。	Last, but certainly not least, several psychologists and neuroscientists – the best known among them is Tali Sharot of University College London – argue that the human brain is hardwired for optimism.
美国也许看到了复苏强化的信号，但欧元区仍有步日本衰退后尘的危险，而新兴市场也在担忧出口拉动增长战略使使它们极易受国外停滞的影响。	The United States may be seeing signs of a strengthening recovery, but the eurozone risks following Japan into recession, and emerging markets worry that their export-led growth strategies have left them vulnerable to stagnation abroad.
与此同时，生产阶段日益激烈的竞争压低了价格，使实际的生产者 — — 无论是雇主还是工人 — — 在价值蛋糕中的份额日益减少。	Meanwhile, increasingly intense competition in the production phase drives down prices, so that the actual producers, whether employers or workers, receive diminishing shares of the value pie.
但在过去的几年中，一些国家越来越多的让外国人和具有国外经验的人来担任通常被国家视为第二最重要的位置：中央银行首脑。	But, during the last few years, countries have increasingly turned to foreigners and people with considerable foreign experience to assume what is generally viewed as a country’s second most important position: head of the central bank.
同时科学数据无法传达的紧迫性也已经被地球本身所表现出来了 — — 通过肆虐的飓风，洪水，野火以及致命的干旱。	And, whatever urgency science cannot convey is being communicated by the planet itself – through a ferocious display of hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and deadly droughts.
只有49%的制造业创业企业和37%的信息产业制造企业能活过四年，但越过了这个门槛的企业都能推出突破性创新。	While only about 49% of manufacturing startups and 37% of information startups survive for four or more years, those that do have managed to produce breakthrough innovations.
沃尔夫随后指出他“担心金融体系的脆弱性和它为业内人士所制造的高报酬融合在一起将破坏更为重要的事物，即市场经济本身的政治合法性 … … ”	Wolf then announced his “fear that the combination of the fragility of the financial system with the huge rewards it generates for insiders will destroy something even more important – the political legitimacy of the market economy itself...”
许多中国人已经从直接现金支付转向移动在线支付 — — 绕过了支票和信用卡 — — 中国的支付系统具有很强的鲁棒性。	With much of the country’s population having shifted directly from cash to mobile online payments – skipping checks and credit cards – China’s payments systems are robust.
2000年以来，中国与东盟十国的双边贸易额从320亿美元跃升至去年的3，500亿美元，增长了10倍，2015年甚至可能达到5，000亿美元。	Since 2000, bilateral trade between China and the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has grown tenfold, from $32 billion to $350 billion last year, and could reach $500 billion in 2015.
齐普拉斯和瓦鲁法基斯应该已经看到了这一可能，因为同样的事情两年前发生过 — — 深陷银行危机的塞浦路斯试图挑战欧盟。	Tsipras and Varoufakis should have seen this coming, because the same thing happened two years ago, when Cyprus, in the throes of a banking crisis, attempted to defy the EU.
外交尝试用了多年的时间才获得胜利，在此期间，中东经历了各种各样本可避免的对峙，丧失了许多安全合作机会。	In the years that it has taken for diplomatic sanity to prevail, the Middle East has endured myriad avoidable tensions and lost opportunities for security cooperation.
假设未来两年美国政府多借5000亿美元，并将这笔钱用于基础设施建设 — — 即使这些投资并非生产性的，其社会回报率只有每年25 % 。	Suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra $500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure – even unproductively, on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly 25% per year.
因此，沿着这条路走下去将进一步降低决策者的信誉 — — 不过他们似乎并不在乎 — — 而世界其他地区则将继续感受危机和不确定性，造成实实在在的金融和经济成本。	Thus, continuing down this path will further erode policymakers’ credibility – not that they seem to care – while imposing on the rest of the world a persistent sense of crisis and uncertainty, with real financial and economic costs.
新兴国家可能增长得更快，但它们的人均资本存量仍无法与发达国家相比（事实上，这才是发展的真正要点 ） 。	Emerging countries may be growing faster, but their per capita capital stock still does not match that of advanced countries (in fact, this is precisely what development is largely about).
具体而言，日本的年人均GDP增长率在1960年代平均达8.6 ％ ， 随后在1970~80年代快速下降到3~4 ％ ； 韩国的GDP增长率从1970~80年代的年均7~8％下跌到2000年的4 ％ ； 中国持续三十年之久的两位数增长在2010年走到了尽头，目前年均增长不足7 ％ 。	Specifically, Japan’s annual per capita GDP growth averaged 8.6% in the 1960s, before plummeting to 3-4% in the 1970s and 1980s. South Korea’s GDP growth dropped from 7-8% in the 1970s and 1980s to 4% in the 2000s.
至于与中国的俄贸易 ， 《 经济学人》指出“印度每向中国出口1美元（主要是原材料 ） ， 都要进口3美元 。 ”	As for trade with China, The Economist points out that “for every dollar’s worth of exports to China [principally raw materials], India imports three.”
纳沙泰尔州对外国居民的进步思想很大程度上应该归功于一个人，这个人的名字叫 托马斯·法基内蒂，这个人在二十年前首创并发展了多元文化融合服务。	Much of Neuchatel’s progressive attitude toward foreign residents is attributable to one man, Thomas Facchinetti, who started a multicultural cohesion service 20 years ago and has steadily built it up.
而中国在战略资产和军事能力现代化上所取得的进步则主要得益于其当前进行的国防工业转型，尤其是过去十年间在航空航天部门所取得的成果。	China’s progress in modernizing its strategic assets and capabilities owes much to the ongoing transformation of China’s defense industries, particularly the aerospace sector, over the past decade.
莫拉维茨基现已宣誓接替贝亚塔·希德沃出任总理一职，在希德沃就任总理期间，法律与正义党一直享受着高规格待遇 — — 10月在民意调查中的受欢迎程度达到47 % — —是该党有史以来的最高值。	Morawiecki has now been sworn in as prime minister, succeeding Beata Szydło, under whose premiership the PiS enjoyed higher favorability – reaching 47% in October – than at any other time in its history.
据萨默斯的说法，高储蓄导致了低增长；根据本文的另一种解释，首先是高增长 — — 及其不同的特征 — — 推动了高储蓄。	According to Summers, high savings caused weak growth; under the alternative explanation offered here, it was primarily rapid growth – and its distinctive features – that drove high savings.
我们就会发现在全球化的世界经济存亡中中国究竟持有何种悠关利益。 正如在1931年那样，政治观点都是反对采取行动。	We are about to see what stake China really has in the survival of the globalized world economy. As in 1931, the political arguments are all against such an operation. Only the far-sighted will see that the economic case for a rescue is compelling.
针对1835年的“病态”法国，托克维尔用健康的美国作为对比。 在美国，关于应该追求自我利益的观点也像法国一样流行，但两者之间并不一样。	To the “sick” France of 1835, Tocqueville counterposed healthy America, where attachment to the idea that people should pursue their self-interest was no less strong, but was different.
根据商定的协议，所有参与国都可以自由确定自己的减排目标和实现这些目标的政策，还可以按照自认为适当的方式来进行修正。	Under the agreed deal, all participating countries are free to determine their own emissions-reduction targets and the policies for achieving them, and they may make revisions as they see fit.
但在结束也门战争 — — 相较叙利亚战争，也门战争处于较早阶段，并且牵涉到的国际和地区利益也较少 — — 方面是有可能取得进展的，特别是如果考虑到沙特阿拉伯经济困难的话。	But progress toward ending the war in Yemen – which is at an earlier stage than the Syrian war, and entails fewer international and regional interests – is possible, especially given Saudi Arabia’s economic travails.
纽约 — — 出生于一个被称为全新世的气候时代的现代人类已经跨过边界进入到另一个气候时代，人类世之中。	NEW YORK – Modern humans, born into one climate era, called the Holocene, have crossed the border into another, the Anthropocene.
一切条约和承诺 — — 包括至关重要的《马斯特里赫特条约》的“无救援”条款 — — 都必须无一例外地受到尊重。	All treaties and commitments – including, crucially, the Maastricht Treaty’s “no bailout” clause – must be respected without exception.
这个转变不仅提升了中国第十二个五年计划中促进消费议程的重要性；同时还对中国财政和货币当局长期以来的积极策略提出了质疑。	This shift not only elevates the importance of the pro-consumption agenda of China’s 12th Five-Year Plan; it also calls into question the longstanding proactive tactics of the country’s fiscal and monetary authorities.
中东可以采取的第一步是理顺地区监管措施，各国在测试药物对本地人口的安全性和效力的参数方面需要取得一致。	The first step that the Middle East can take is to align regulations across the region, with countries agreeing on the parameters for testing drugs’ safety and efficacy in the local population.
举个例子，宝马Mini的曲轴在车辆完工的过程中要三次跨越英吉利海峡，这意味着任何出入境的延迟都会影响到这条供应链的盈利能力。	To take just one example, the crankshaft of a BMW Mini crosses the English Channel three times before the car is completed, which means that any delay at the border will destroy the profitability of that supply chain.
推特服务的技术漏洞在此之前已经引发关注，目前正在向复杂的验证模型过渡（密码搭配经由短信或其他设备发送的一次性密钥 ） 。	Twitter’s vulnerabilities were technically understood before this event, and the service was already moving toward a more sophisticated authentication model (a password paired with a one-time key from a text message or other device).
欧元区债务危机正在破坏规模更大、拥有27个成员国的欧盟的合作，造成最近峰会上关于欧盟预算方案的大失败。	The region’s debt crisis is undermining cooperation within the larger 27-member European Union, resulting in the spectacular failure of the recent summit on the EU budget.
与此同时，当人们开始质疑这台量子计算机的真伪时，其设计者在权威专业杂志上发表文章，阐述了构成这台崭新计算机的基本元素其实就是超导的量子位。	And, while some question whether the machine is truly a quantum computer, its designers have published articles in peer-reviewed journals demonstrating that the basic elements of this novel computer are indeed superconducting quantum bits.
这些妇女现在正在照顾从在俄罗斯入侵阿布哈兹和南奥塞梯后从那些地区新迁移来此的大量民众，而且，自入侵发生后，俄罗斯也占领了格鲁吉亚疆域内的一些地区。	These women are now hosting a new flood of displaced civilians from Abkhazia and South Ossetia after Russia’s aggression in those regions, as well as within the Georgian territories that Russian forces have occupied since the invasion.
今天，因为法国领导了保护利比亚民众免受其领袖侵害的国际斗争，他们可以同时为自己的法国和阿拉伯身份感到骄傲。	And today, with France taking the lead in an international effort to protect the Libyan people from their leader, they can feel simultaneously proud of being French and of their Arab roots.
中国人民银行降低基准政策利率的措施彰显出中国政府对稳定政策的战术性关注。 中国政府将GDP增长下限定在7%左右。	By cutting its benchmark policy interest rates on November 21, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has underscored the tactical focus of the government’s stabilization policy, which aims to put a floor of around 7% on GDP growth.
但由此造成的争议可以解决，政治上的敌意也是可以化解的。 具体实现方式就是通过致力于实现广大的共同利益的多边机构进行监督。	But the resulting controversies can be resolved, and the political venom neutralized, through surveillance by multilateral institutions that are committed to achieving an overarching good.
事实上，在无人区和自然保护区之外，因为苏联解体后的重大社会经济变化加剧了农村贫困并破坏了野生动物管理，麋鹿和野猪种群出现了大幅减少的势头。	Indeed, in areas outside the zone or nature reserves, populations of elk and wild boar underwent steep declines, as major socioeconomic changes after the fall of the Soviet Union worsened rural poverty and crippled wildlife management.
我们需要调整农业及渔业生产以适应环境的承载能力，而不能在毫不顾忌对其他物种影响的情况下狩猎、捕鱼和砍伐树木。	Instead of hunting, fishing, and clearing land without regard for the impact on other species, we need to pace our agricultural production, fishing, and logging in line with the environment’s carrying capacity.
公路信托基金是美国公路和交通基础设施的主要联邦资金源，每年为基础设施支出提供约500亿美元的资金，其破产将迫使州和地方政府的数千个项目搁置，威胁数十万建筑业工人的饭碗。	The HTF finances about $50 billion of infrastructure spending a year, and its bankruptcy would have forced state and local governments to shelve thousands of projects, threatening tens of thousands of construction jobs.
事实上，如果中国推行保持经济快速增长所需的结构改革和技术升级，相比于2009年的仅1.57亿，到2030年那里的中产阶级人口将达到10亿之多。	Indeed, if China pursues the structural reforms and technological upgrading needed to maintain rapid economic growth, its middle class should exceed one billion people in 2030, up from 157 million in 2009.
即便中国的货币总供应量看似超额（M2-GDP比率目前达到了190 % ） ，真正的货币基数却比看上去要小。	Thus, although China’s total money supply seems excessive, with the M2-to-GDP ratio now at about 190%, the real monetary base is actually much smaller than it appears.
希土之间的睦邻友好关系也为欧盟和土耳其之间建立更紧密的关系创建了一个框架。 作为一个进步政党，PASOK非常关注土耳其国内改革的进程。	Turkey’s governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) was elected on a pro-European platform, reflecting the public’s demand for modernization and democratization.
在主要的每种宗教中，都问及了这样一个问题：如果我们丧失了道德价值，获得财富和权力又将如何造福我们呢？	“In every major religion, a version of the following question is asked: what does it profit us to gain wealth and power if we lose our moral values?
俄亥俄州的罗伯·波特曼（Rob Portman）甚至担任过小布什总统的白宫行政和预算管理局（Office of Management and Budget）主任。	Rob Portman of Ohio even served as Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under President George W Bush.
如果美国能源进口量有所减少，那么从长期看它的脆弱性将会减小，但石油是一种可替代商品，而美国经济仍然对世界油价的突然变化所带来的冲击非常敏感。	The US may be less vulnerable in the long run if it imports less energy, but oil is a fungible commodity, and the US economy will remain sensitive to shocks from sudden changes in world prices.
即便如此，历史的教训也告诉我们：仅仅需要一部授权法就能够动摇法治，并代之以意识形态上的独裁，希特勒在德国掌权就是最好的例子。	Even then, we know from history that it takes but one Enabling Law to unhinge the rule of law and replace it by an ideological tyranny, as happened when Hitler came to power in Germany.
在其它国家，特别是前苏联的加盟共和国和拉美国家，大权在握的人干脆按自己的意愿修改宪法¾其中就包括限制任期的规定。	Elsewhere, notably in many of the Soviet Union’s other successor states and in Latin America, those in power have often simply changed the constitution – including rules on term limits – to their advantage.
在诸如软件和研发等领域的无形资产投资在2009年的危机后下跌本身就较为短暂且幅度不大，同时恢复的幅度也更快。	Intangible investment, in areas such as software and research and development, recovered far more quickly from a brief and smaller post-crisis dip in 2009.
如果疾控中心的资金维持在正常水平，美国就可能提前派出训练有素的公共卫生人员而非作战部队，抗击埃博拉的效果也会更加明显。	Had CDC funding been at an appropriate level, US support – in the form of highly trained public health professionals, rather than ground troops – might have been deployed much earlier and been more effective.
结果 — — 在排放测试中舞弊 — — 体现的与其说是德国制造业文化，不如说是大众公司从最顶层开始的腐败。	The result – a decision to cheat on emissions tests – says less about Germany’s culture of manufacturing than about rot at the car company, beginning at the very top.
中间派政党的竞选口号是“社会公正 ” ， 极端宗教学生应该“共同分担”军事任务（自以色列建国以来，他们就免于服役 ） ， 以色列苦苦挣扎的中产阶级也应该得到保护。	Parties in the center campaigned for “social justice,” for ultra-religious students to “share the burden” of military service (from which they have been exempt since Israel’s founding), and in defense of the country’s struggling middle class.
自2003年以来，东非地区记录了8个最温暖年份，毫无疑问，这与困扰非洲之角1300万人的大饥荒密切相关。	Since 2003, East Africa has had the eight warmest years on record, which is no doubt contributing to the severe famine that now afflicts 13 million people in the Horn of Africa.
如今，欧盟似乎无力阻止极权民粹主义在其创始成员国的崛起，保持凝聚力需要新的泛欧洲叙事，这个叙事要糅合多样的民族历史和政治习性。	Now that the EU seems incapable of stemming its rise among the bloc’s own founding members, maintaining cohesion would require a new pan-European narrative, one that incorporates diverse national histories and political idiosyncrasies.
于是他们对“民族”大加颂扬并将政策聚焦于与其它国家的零和争端之上，同时找那些国内的邪恶“异己”作为替罪羊。	Thus they exalt the “nation” and focus their policies on zero-sum quarrels with other countries and on scapegoating deviant “aliens” at home.
许多人认为全球不平衡是问题的根源，这种不平衡反映出美国的储蓄率近乎于零。 那些效仿美国最出色的经济体也是如此，包括英国，爱尔兰和西班牙。	The global imbalances that many people view as being at the root of the problem reflected savings rates of near zero in the US, as well as in those economies that seemed best to emulate the American model – the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Spain.
所以，一般性贷款和项目贷款的需求比以往任何时候都高：2009年头9个月，我们已经投资超过60亿欧元，这个数目是去年同期投资的两倍之多。	Demand for our loans and project finance is higher than ever: in the first nine months of 2009, we have invested more than €6 billion, twice as much as we did in the same period a year ago.
我们不以投入 — — 包括援助或自然资源收入为依据，也不注重政府的承诺和目标；相反，我们选择衡量政府行为对民众生活的影响。	We do not measure inputs – including aid or natural-resource revenues – or government promises and commitments; instead, we have chosen to measure the impact of government activities on the lives of citizens.
同样，很多渔业经营者的潜在子嗣最终选择了其他职业，现在可以借此机会对他们手中的资源进行重组和整合，借此充分发挥规模经济优势。	Similarly, individually operated fishing businesses whose potential heirs ended up choosing other careers can now be reorganized and consolidated, thereby taking advantage of greater economies of scale.
自此以后，免疫运动在本地招募工作人员，让他们在本家族内工作，并与地方军事领导人商谈进入开展工作事宜，以此进入叛军控制地区。	Since then, immunization campaigns have improved their access to rebel-controlled areas by employing locally recruited staff to work within their own clans and negotiate access with local-level militant leaders.
雅凯特·蒂蒙斯（ Jacquette Timmons ） ， 这位专门教导女性财务知识的天才教练所写的新书《财务上的亲密感 》 ， 为所有当前正处于危机中的中产阶级女性提供了一些宝贵的真理。	The new book Financial Intimacy , by Jacquette Timmons, a talented financial coach who focuses on women, offers truths that would have been valuable to any of the middle-class women now in crisis.
巴黎报道 — — 76年前的1933年6月，世界货币与经济会议在伦敦举行，与会的66个国家的首脑齐心协力地商讨着如何终结如火如荼的货币失调与贸易战争，并同时总结着大萧条给人的教训。	PARIS – The World Monetary and Economic Conference took place in London 76 years ago, in June 1933, with 66 countries meeting to put an end to the unfolding monetary disorder and trade wars while trying to draw the lessons of the Great Depression.
二十世纪四十年代末和五十年代初，冷战以及担心红色威胁将从内部削弱美国的决心产生难以计数的反颠覆项目，数以万计的美国人因此丢掉了生计。	In the late 1940’s and the 1950’s, the Cold War and fears that the Red Menace would sap American resolve from within led to myriad anti-subversive programs, with tens of thousands of Americans losing their livelihoods as a result.
而主角的台词（当中所有的引用都是恰如其分的）也仍是那些不会揭穿美国在关于伊拉克和阿富汗问题上的利己主义外表的套话。	The characters’ lines (all quotes are approximate) are those that never pierce the bubble of American self-regard with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan.
在广义而言，美国人对移民的看法就是欢迎他们把原始国家的文化同美国化结合起来，而移民本身并不认为自己的种族和宗教与接纳美国观点有什么矛盾。	More generally, Americans view immigrants as being welcome to combine their culture of origin with their new American-ness, while immigrants see no conflict between their ethnicity and religion and their embrace of America.
个人需求差别很大，但是私人保险公司往往不愿投保那些最需要医疗服务的人群（例如那些已经生病的人，或可能会引发其他健康问题的糖尿病患者 ） 。	Individual needs vary significantly, and private companies are often unwilling to insure the very people who need the most care (such as those who are already ill, or who have conditions like diabetes, which predispose them to other health problems).
它与 消极的政教分离 形成鲜明的对照，按照萨科奇的说法，后者能做的只是“谴责和排斥 ” ， 而 积极的政教分离 却可以实现“对话 ” ， 并承认宗教的社会效益。	In contrast to negative laïcité , which according to Sarkozy “excludes and denounces,” laïcité positive invites “dialogue” and recognizes the social benefits of religion.
墨西哥城—总统涅托（Enrique Peña Nieto）不到两年，墨西哥实施了雄心勃勃的结构改革计划，旨在将墨西哥经济带出多年的低增长陷阱并为公民创造新机遇。	MEXICO CITY – Less than two years into Enrique Peña Nieto’s presidency, Mexico is implementing an ambitious structural-reform package designed to lift its economy out of a multi-decade low-growth trap and create new opportunities for its citizens.
与此同时，该地区最古老的纠纷 — — 一个进行了几十年仍不知所踪的和平进程 — — 依旧在巴勒斯坦和以色列不断恶化。	Meanwhile, the oldest dispute in the region – the subject of a decades-long peace process that moves nowhere – continues to fester and worsen in Palestine and Israel.
除了不断带来焦虑，特朗普的奇异任期还提出了一个更加根本性的问题：已经在世界各国众多前哨阵地遭到围困的自由民主，如今是否也有可能失去自己的大本营？	Beyond producing constant anxiety, Trump’s bizarre presidency poses a more fundamental question: Having already come under siege in many of its outposts around the world, is liberal democracy now at risk of losing its citadel, too?
成为民主政体的国家在其政治转型之后通常不会获得更快的经济增长；而反之亦然，未能成功实现民主或重归专制的国家的经济发展也通常不会比以前更糟糕。	Countries that become democracies do not, on average, achieve faster economic growth after their political transition; and, vice versa, democracies that fail and relapse into autocracy do not, on average, do worse than before.
如果富国采用更简单且更实用的战略来帮助非洲迎战疟疾，那么它们就能够拯救上百万非洲人的生命并在它们的国民中建立积极有效的支持。	If rich countries adopt simpler and more practical strategies to help Africa fight malaria, they can save millions of Africans while building enthusiastic support among their citizens.
尽管政府最近宣布它将把研发费用在2010年提高到GDP的2 % ， 但是这依然低于经合组织2.2%的平均水平。	Although the government recently announced that it intends to increase R&D spending to 2% of GDP by 2010, this remains below the OECD average of 2.2%.
只有制定一个长期的战略，东道国政府才能确保中国（和其他地区）的投资行为是一个发展的工具，而不只是一种获得短期利润的手段。	Only with a long-term strategy can host governments ensure that Chinese (and other) investments become a tool of development, not just a means of generating short-term profit.
但过去几十年，在制定共同的欧盟外交和安全政策方面已经取得了更多进展，并且在这一目标的指导下组建了新的构架和体系。	But over the last few decades, there has been more movement toward establishing a common EU foreign and security policy, and new structures and institutions have been developed with that goal in mind.
如果托宾税的目标是增强金融机构（而不是改变市场 ） ， 其效果将更加明显，就算并非所有大国就采用它也是如此。	If the Tobin tax aims to strengthen institutions (instead of altering markets), it could bite hard, even without the buy-in of every major country.
但是，在1991年举行的议会选举中（此时距离这份宪法被采纳已逾两年 ） ， 胜出的依然是伊斯兰拯救阵线（Islamic Salvation Front ） 。	Yet, when parliamentary elections were held in 1991 – more than two years after the constitution was adopted – the Islamic Salvation Front still won.
此前，含铅油漆和汽油据估计每年也要造成150,000多人死亡，而全球变暖造成的死亡人数为141,000人。	Previous generations’ use of lead in paints and gasoline is estimated to cause almost 700,000 deaths annually. Ground-level ozone pollution kills more than 150,000 people per year, while global warming causes another 141,000 deaths.
传统智慧认为当她在2021年德国下一次联邦大选后交出总理职位时 — — 如果她的大联盟陷入崩溃可能还要早得多 — — 人们会非常想念她。	According to the conventional wisdom, when she hands over the chancellorship after Germany’s next federal election in 2021 – and perhaps much sooner if her grand coalition collapses – she will be sorely missed.
今年的大选则在这层分歧之上又加上了更加传统的左右分歧，卷土重来的工党利用了选民对保守党削减预算政策的不满。	This year’s general election superimposed on this a more traditional left-right split, with a resurgent Labour Party capitalizing on voter discontent with Conservative budget cuts.
俄罗斯（和中国）领导人赞成以无条件国家主前为基础的国际制度，拒绝西方提出的人道主义“干涉有理 ” （ droit d’ingérence）说。	Russia’s leaders (and China’s) seek to uphold an international system that relies on the unconditional sovereignty of states and rejects the Western-inspired, humanitarian droit d’ingérence.
例如，他与一名在伊拉克战死的美军士兵的穆斯林父母爆发冲突，又在自觉被冷落时与众议院议长保罗·瑞安（Paul Ryan）斗气。	For example, he became embroiled in a dispute with an American Muslim couple whose son, a US soldier, was killed in Iraq, and in a petty feud with Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, after Trump felt slighted.
但对第三国武器出口共同政策的制定进程不可孤立运行，同时还需要建立一个共有且具备国际竞争力的欧洲防务市场。	Developing a common policy on arms exports to such countries should go hand in hand with the creation of a common and internationally competitive European defense-equipment market.
因为如果俄罗斯的反西方偏执狂以及克里姆林宫想与中国结盟的欧亚白日梦再持续另一个10到15年，俄罗斯将最终看到中国吞下它的远东和西伯利亚地区。	For if Russia’s anti-Western paranoia continues and the Kremlin’s Eurasian fantasy of allying with China lasts another 10-15 years, Russia will end up seeing China swallowing its Far East and Siberia.
华盛顿 — — 自2008年金融危机爆发以来，媒体和专家投入了大量精力来预测其对全球经济的负面冲击。	WASHINGTON, DC – Ever since the financial crisis erupted in 2008, media outlets and specialists alike have devoted much attention to anticipating negative shocks to the global economy.
在对联邦议会的讲话中，普京把自己定位为反对“忍耐、中性和不育 ” （ 同性恋权利的委婉说法）的保守主义价值观捍卫者以及道德和传统家庭价值观的倡导者。	In his address to the Federal Assembly, Putin positioned himself as a defender of conservative values against “tolerance, neutered and barren” (a euphemism for gay rights) and a champion of morality and traditional family values.
加拿大总理特鲁多在2017年3月的得克萨斯州休斯顿能源会议上承认 ， “ 没有一个国家会在地里找到1,730亿桶石油而放任它们埋在地里 。 ”	As Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau conceded at a March 2017 energy conference in Houston, Texas, “no country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there.”
在海湾合作委员会闭门会议期间，沙特提出地区所有问题的根本原因是伊朗（但沙特却邀请了伊拉克，而沙特常说伊拉克不过是伊朗的代理人 ） 。	During the GCC deliberations, Iran was singled out as the root cause of all the region’s problems (although the Saudis did invite Iraq which it often suggests is nothing but an Iranian surrogate).
REDD+是联合国气候变化框架公约的一部分，而管理其实施的协定预计将在联合国气候变化巴黎会议上完成。	REDD+ was created as part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the agreement governing its implementation is expected to be finalized during the UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris.
在这方面其他发达国家的情况也一样，全球经济面临着一个延续多年的低增长期，并伴随着由欧洲，美国及其他地方的政策僵局和失误所导致的残余风险。	To the extent that this is true of other advanced economies, the global economy faces an extended multi-year period of low growth, with residual downside risk coming from policy gridlock and mistakes in Europe, the US, and elsewhere.
只有一个区域性和全球性的将阿富汗的稳定置于高于其他目标之上的协议，才能使长期稳定成为可能，使阿富汗以它能负担得起的安全军队而生存下去。	Only a regional and global agreement to place Afghanistan’s stability above other objectives can make long-term stability possible by enabling Afghanistan to survive with security forces that it can afford.
如果贸易战升级，双方都将建立系统性进口壁垒，这将助推美国的通胀压力，有可能促使美联储更快更大幅地提高利率。	An escalating trade war, with each side erecting symmetric import barriers, would fuel inflationary pressure in the US, potentially driving the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates higher and faster than it would otherwise.
外汇市场将考虑这些因素，更快地调整汇率以响应经常项目失衡，消除大部分在今天支撑长期失衡贸易的资本流。	Foreign-exchange markets will factor this in, adjusting exchange rates faster in response to current-account imbalances and canceling out much of the capital flows which today support chronically unbalanced trade.
除了气候污染，高达60%的生物多样性损失要归因于为了养殖动物而做出的土地用途改变，80%的耕地被用来饲养动物或种植饲料。	Beyond climate pollution, a staggering 60% of all biodiversity loss is attributable to land-use changes from animal cultivation, and as much as 80% of all land in farming is devoted either to raising animals or to growing their feed.
注册系统，比如墨西哥的身份证系统（matricula consular ） ， 有助于确保各国了解危机发生时本国移民的为止，包括没有记录在案者。	Registration systems, such as Mexico’s matricula consular, help to ensure that countries know the location of their migrants – including those who are undocumented – in a crisis.
也有少数例外：在经历了二十多年的停滞后，日本经济在首相安倍晋三政府的带领下扭转了局面；但是，通缩从20世纪90年代就开始困扰日本，走出通缩还有很长的路要走。	There are a few exceptions: After more than two decades, Japan’s economy appears to be turning a corner under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government; but, with a legacy of deflation stretching back to the 1990’s, it will be a long road back.
全球性的金融危机很少会接连而至，但在这种巨额利润的刺激之下，银行业会一再铤而走险 — — IMF 五十多年的历程非常清楚地表明了这点。	But, finally, after Massachusetts, it looks as if something important is happening.
如果成功，现在这一代非洲领导人将有独一无二的机会保护后代免于气候灾难、他们还能让所有人享受能源带来的好处并建设共同繁荣。	If we do, the current generation of African leaders has a unique opportunity to protect future generations from a climate disaster, deliver on the promise of energy for all, and build shared prosperity.
一旦欧盟六个中心创始国开始扩张欧盟以吸纳北欧、南欧以及最近加入的东欧国家，联邦国家的陈旧说法就注定失败。	Once the original six core countries began to expand to include northern, southern, and, most recently, eastern European countries, the old federal vision was doomed.
事实上，在将美国力量事实驱逐出本地军事基地二十年后，菲律宾迎回了美国军队，以此作为新军事合作协议的一部分。	Indeed, two decades after essentially tossing US forces out of local bases, the Philippines has welcomed back American troops as part of a new military cooperation deal.
它奠基于以市场为导向的贸易自由化制度，资本流动性的提升以及适当的社会福利政策；而其后盾则是由美国通过北约和各种其他联盟组织向欧洲，中东和亚洲提供的安全保障。	It rests on market-oriented regimes of trade liberalization, increased capital mobility, and appropriate social-welfare policies; backed by American security guarantees in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, through NATO and various other alliances.
实际上她遭到了她自己以前的盟友，费尔多克以及荷兰各种对外国人持憎恨态度的人的背叛，他们对一个来自索马里的敢于直言不讳的黑人女移民的讨厌并不亚于他们对穆斯林的讨厌。	She was betrayed by her own former ally, Rita Verdonk, and a variety of Dutch xenophobes, who don’t like an outspoken black female immigrant from Somalia any more than they like Muslims.
这种适应能力提高了瘟疫的生物适应性，而这对啮齿动物 — — 以及生活在啮齿动物周围的人来说 — — 已经被证明是一场噩梦。	This adaptation improved the plague’s biological fitness, which, for rodents – and the humans who live near them – has proven to be a nightmare.
不先断绝独立的资金来源，就根本不可能压制独立的政治家和媒体，这也是普京领导的克里姆林宫集中全力打击所谓“寡头政治”的原因所在。	It is impossible to silence independent politicians and independent media without choking off independent sources of money, which is why Putin’s Kremlin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called “oligarchs.”
全球经济在政治和经济动荡中的复苏表明改革过程的核心实用性 - - 并且说明继续沿着这条道路走下去的重要性。	The resilience of the global economy in the face of political and economic shocks demonstrates the central relevance of the reform process - and underlines the importance of continuing along this path.
但这并不意味着该团体会解散；恰恰相反，它可能迁移到利比亚和乍得边境地区，从而威胁到西非城市及其水利设施。	But that does not mean that the group will disband; on the contrary, it may well relocate to the border areas between Libya and Chad, putting West African cities and water installations at risk.
但民营的新技术巨头却是多产品、全方位的渠道平台，可以通吃所有供应链环节 — — 包括生产、分销、支付，目前还在进军财富管理。	Yet the new tech giants are multi-product, omni-channel platforms that cut across all sectors, including production, distribution, payments, and, increasingly, wealth management.
要不了多久就用可能冒出新型的加强版Uber，将汽车、公交、轮船、飞机旅行和饭店服务集合到一个超级应用中。	Soon a new kind of enhanced Uber could emerge, integrating car, bus, ship, airplane travel, and hotel rooms into one super-app.
布什政府没有意识到这些人口和环境方面的挑战，8000亿的安全支出不会给阿富汗、巴基斯坦、苏丹和索马里带来灌溉，因此也无法带来和平。	The Bush administration fails to recognize these fundamental demographic and environmental challenges, that $800 billion of security spending won’t bring irrigation to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, and Somalia, and therefore won’t bring peace.
我们并不真正知道什么能够让增长更加包容，让国家更具竞争力，让各个地区和国家的发展更加可持续；并且我们也不应该装作我们知道。	We do not really know what could make growth more inclusive, countries more competitive, and development more sustainable in each country and region; and we should not pretend that we do.
问题不在于采用哪一种税率（这能够也应该通过竞争来决定 ） ， 而是协调的目的在于使跨界交易更为便利。	The question is not one of aligning tax rates, which can and should be determined by competition. Rather, the aim of harmonization is to make cross-border trade easier for business.
位居香港之后的城市是悉尼（12.2 ） 、 温哥华（11.8 ） 、 奥克兰（10 ） 、 圣何塞/硅谷（9.6 ） 、 墨尔本（9.5）和洛杉矶（9.3 ） 。	After Hong Kong, the list continues with Sydney (12.2), Vancouver (11.8), Auckland (10), San Jose/Silicon Valley (9.6), Melbourne (9.5), and Los Angeles (9.3).
美国人是后来者，但朝鲜对美帝国主义的官方仇恨不仅来自于野蛮的朝鲜战争，同时也来自于外国压迫留下的漫长而痛苦的记忆。	The Americans are latecomers, but official hatred of American imperialism in North Korea stems not only from the savage Korean War, but also from the long memory of foreign oppression.
If we can afford that much to save banks, we can afford something more to save the planet.	If we can afford that much to save banks, we can afford something more to save the planet.

似是而非的是，在掌控如此重要的权力如此之久以后，谁也说不清布莱尔会对英国国内留下什么影响，如果有影响的话。	The paradox is that, for a man who wielded so much power for so long, it is unclear what domestic legacy, if any, Blair will leave.
按照社会学家的分类，女性领导人可以归为两类：蜂后型，不太可能帮助其他女性晋升；以及正义女神型，将把其他女性的晋升列为重点。	According to sociologists, female leaders are of two schools: Queen Bees, who are less likely to help other women advance, and Righteous Women, who make the advancement of other women a priority.
如果一位妇女能够接种流感等常见疾病的疫苗，她的身体就能产生能够识别病毒、增强病原体自然抵抗力的抗体。	When a woman is vaccinated against common illnesses like influenza, her body creates antibodies that recognize viruses and boost natural defenses against pathogens.
美国的民主制度为其重视短期成果的习惯付出了沉重的代价：减税与不断增加的福利支出带来了长期财政赤字，以致未来几代人都必须为过去几十年的过度消费买单。	American democracy’s emphasis on short time horizons is costly, with tax cuts and increased welfare benefits giving rise to chronic fiscal deficits, with future generations forced to foot the bill for years of excessive consumption.
在此次驻军过程中，这支部队的备战能力实际有所提升，因为他们与来自韩国友军的同伴共同接受了高质量的严格训练。	Over the course of the deployment, the readiness of these forces actually increases, because of the quality and rigor of the training they undertake with partners from the Republic of Korea’s Army.
库尔德问题困扰着土耳其，除此之外，越来越多的土耳其人感到他们正在失去对两大关键问题的控制，即叙利亚和伊朗危机。	The Kurdish problem preoccupies Turks, as does their growing sense that they are losing control of two essential issues – the Syrian and Iranian crises.
这种无声无息的对和平的推动一直是欧洲经济进一步一体化的主要动力，而欧洲经济一体化被看作是达到政治一体化的一种手段。	This drive for peace remained, quietly, the key motivation behind further steps toward Europe’s economic integration, which was regarded as the vehicle for achieving political integration.
巴黎袭击发生后，法国和比利时（恐怖袭击预谋和组织的地方）无限期中止公民自由，一夜之间摇身一变成为（至少是法律意义上的）警察国家。	After the Paris attacks, France and Belgium (where the plot was planned and organized) suspended civil liberties indefinitely, transforming themselves overnight into what are, at least by statute, police states.
但一个反覆无常的政客一夜之间颠覆建立已久的结构和机制是非常困难的，如果这不是为了更加根本性的变化的话。	But it would be very difficult for an erratic politician suddenly to overturn long-established structures and mechanisms, were it not for a more fundamental economic shift.
在与美国国内商业界沟通后，美国联邦储备委员会已经警告说由于全球贸易关系的不确定性，企业的投资计划可能会“缩减或推迟 ” 。	Already, the US Federal Reserve, relying on its contacts in the domestic business community, has warned that corporate investment plans could be “scaled back or postponed” because of uncertainty over global trade relations.
在奥巴马总统提议召开的特别峰会上，联合国安理会一致通过了一项决议，翻开了联合国解决核扩散及核裁军问题的全新篇章。	At a special summit called by the President Obama, the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that opens a new chapter in the UN’s efforts to address nuclear proliferation and disarmament.
伯克利—阅读美联储前主席本·伯南克的新自传《行动的勇气 》 （ The Courage to Act ） ， 除了悲剧之外再难有别的感觉。	BERKELEY – It is difficult to read former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke’s new memoir, The Courage to Act, as anything other than a tragedy.
当时欧美达成了一个默契，美国人当世界银行行长，欧洲人当 IMF 总裁（当年美国的决策者自以为是地认为世界银行会成为两者之中更重要的国际组织 ） 。	The bargain then was that the US could pick the president of the World Bank while the Europeans would get the top slot at the IMF (US policymakers in their wisdom believing that the Bank would become the more important institution).
沙特家族的一些支系正在接触 — — 尽管十分谨慎 — — 公民社会活动家，试图让他们参与关于沙特阿拉伯未来的对话。	And some factions of the Saudi family are reaching out – albeit cautiously – to civil-society actors, attempting to engage them in a dialogue about the country’s future.
盖茨非常了解美国糟糕的种族关系史，甚至可以说是这方面的专家，因此他本能地认为自己成了种族歧视的受害者。	Gates, deeply conscious, indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country, instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice.
比方说，当你搭乘伦敦地铁从政府中心区威斯敏斯特向东前往仅仅6英里（约为14站）开外的坎宁镇，地面居民的平均寿命每站都会缩短6个月。	For example, as you travel on the London Underground just six miles (or 14 stops) east from the heart of government at Westminster to Canning Town, the life expectancy of the inhabitants at each successive stop falls by six months.
此外，为了让披露压力变得更有效，选前辩论的一部分应该聚焦于预算方案，问题可以围绕国会预算办公室对具体细节如何反应来展开。	And, to make this pressure to disclose meaningful, part of one debate should focus on budget proposals, with the questions being structured around how the CBO has reacted to specifics.
跨国企业利用留存收益作为研发资金，但因为这种方法可能对企业股票估值造成负面影响，所以就连他们往往都对推动新理念持保守态度。	Multinational corporations use retained earnings to finance R&D, but because this approach can adversely affect a company’s stock valuation, even they tend to be conservative in pushing new ideas forward.
但它的确代表了欧盟从政治经济各个领域支持其转型和改革的明确承诺 — — 这一进程理应为整个地区带来繁荣和稳定。	Nevertheless, it does represent a clear commitment by the EU to lend its political and economic support to their transition and reform – a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the whole region.
但他曾发誓尽力改变特朗普的行为 — — 从他不可预测却往往能够产生严重后果的推文到从私人区域用私人手机拨打电话（特朗普这样做的目的是让凯利无法监听和监控 ） 。	But he has foresworn trying to change Trump’s behavior – from his unpredictable but often consequential tweets, to calls made on a personal phone from his private quarters (so that Kelly couldn’t monitor or listen in).
加拿大和澳大利亚等国家为了明确表示这些大屠杀罪犯不可能在它们的国土上获得安全港，成立了国家机关在本国法庭上起诉这些嫌犯。	Countries like Canada and Australia, seeking certainty that those who had committed horrendous crimes would not find safe haven within their borders, established the authority to try suspects in their own courts.
至于欧盟，它一直最求短视政策解决其经济挑战，而没有预见到 — — 或承认 — — 政治后果，如反欧盟情绪的泛滥。	For its part, the European Union has pursued shortsighted policies to address its economic challenges, without anticipating – or acknowledging – the social and political consequences, including the proliferation of anti-EU sentiment.
内贾德及其派别面临着一个两难困境：在政治上，哈梅内伊已经重创了他们；在经济上，腐败猖獗，改革失败又让很多总统支持者心灰意冷。	Ahmadinejad and his faction face a two-edged problem: Khamenei has boxed them in politically, while rampant economic corruption and failed efforts at reform have disillusioned many of the president’s supporters.
它催生了一系列看似无休止的分析，评论和会议，并成为了上周国际货币基金组织和世界银行年度会议上的主要内容。	It has inspired a seemingly endless train of analyses, commentaries, and conferences, and it featured prominently in last week’s annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
2004年，阿纳斯塔夏季斯及其政党对由前联合国秘书长科菲·安南提议并获欧盟首肯的安南计划表示了支持。	In 2004, Anastasiades and his party supported the Annan Plan, developed by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and supported by the European Union.
巴西利亚—在过去的一年中，大型新兴经济体纷纷因发达国家危机引起欧洲的衰退和美国复苏乏力而遭受重创，特别是上半年。	BRASILIA – Large emerging economies were hit hard in the past year – particularly in the first half – by the crisis in developed countries, with Europe in recession and the United States staging only a meager recovery.
在世纪之交，人类基因组的首次测序带来了“逆向疫苗学 ” （ reverse vaccinology ） 。	Around the turn of the century, the first sequencing of the human genome led to “reverse vaccinology.”

事实上，他们探讨了特朗普取消离任总统巴拉克·奥巴马对俄制裁的可能性，奥巴马制裁俄罗斯是为惩罚该国干预美国大选的活动。	In fact, they had discussed the possibility of Trump lifting sanctions that outgoing President Barack Obama had imposed on Russia as punishment for its interference in the election.
国家债务在八年时间里增加了50 % ， 而增加的一万亿美元花在了打仗上面。 这一数目在十年内可能会增加两倍多。	The national debt has increased by 50% in eight years, with almost $1 trillion of this increase due to the war – an amount likely to more than double within ten years.
在美国，特朗普政府声称有权在示威后征收场地清洁费，实际上就是允许政府向那些行使自身权利的抗议者收费。 宪法权利。	In the United States, the Trump administration has asserted a prerogative to recover cleaning fees after demonstrations, effectively allowing the government to charge protesters for exercising their constitutional right.
特朗普很可能是这一进程的首要支持者；事实上，甚至连区域贸易协议都会被排除在外，因为他反对批准12个国家的跨太平洋伙伴关系。	Trump is likely to be a leading proponent of this tack; in fact, even regional trade deals may be ruled out, as his opposition to ratifying the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership suggests.
这种古老的 — — 但却难以诊断的疾病就会在无意中由诸如一个无症状的生态旅行家这样简单的人或物带进哥斯达黎加。	This debilitating – and difficult to diagnose – illness could thus be introduced to Costa Rica inadvertently by something as simple as an asymptomatic eco-tourist.
只有经济机会才能催生稳定，当越来越多的年轻人能找到工作、养家糊口，而不是靠暴力斗争来改变命运时，才能实现真正的稳定。	Stability will come only when economic opportunities exist, when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families, rather than seeking their fortune in violence.
我们需要草根创新，以及非物质的“创新文化”来实现人类潜能最大化，并通过这条路径实现大繁荣，而不仅仅是寻求满足基本需要。	The kind of mass flourishing that we need depends on grassroots innovation, and on a non-materialist “culture of creativity” that maximizes human potential, rather than only seeking to satisfy basic needs.
与此同时，持续不作为将恶化疏离，形成不信任和瘫痪的恶性循环，只有打破这一循环，才有采取有效行动的可能。	At the same time, continued inaction will fuel alienation, creating a vicious circle of distrust and paralysis that will have to be broken before effective action can occur.
此外，为人们认为有价值的东西付费能有助于实现其价值，就像将会员模式置于纯交易模式之上的举动所表明的那样。	Moreover, paying for something that one perceives as valuable helps make it so, as the move to prioritize membership models over purely transactional approaches illustrates.
它意味着促使民众 — — 或特定民族、宗教或区域团体代表参与公共政策决策，以消除他们被边缘化或永久失败的感受。	It means bringing people – or representatives of specific ethnic, religious, or regional groups – into public-policy decision-making, in order to allay their sense of marginalization or perpetual failure.
今天的极右翼势力可能反穆斯林甚于反犹 — — 怀德斯甚至是以色列拥趸 — — 但他们与20世纪30年代前辈的反人类、愤世嫉俗和种族主义的世界观一脉相承。	Today’s far-right forces may be more anti-Muslim than anti-Semitic – Wilders may even be sincerely pro-Israel – but they maintain the anti-humanist, cynical, and racist worldview of their predecessors in the 1930’s.
而各大国际证券交易所对这些可能无法在国内吸引足够外国机构投资者的大型新兴市场公司（包括国有企业）仍然感兴趣。	International stock exchanges remain of interest to large emerging-market companies, including SOEs, which may be unable to attract sufficient foreign institutional investors at home.
此外，中国仍保持巨大的经常项目盈余，这与20世纪90年代末其他亚洲经济体纷纷出现大规模外部赤字截然不同。	Moreover, China continues to run a large current-account surplus, in contrast to the outsize external deficits that proved so problematic for other Asian economies in the late 1990s.
政府严格控制人口的社会和经济影响导致城市家庭平均生育率从20世纪70年代的户均三个下降到1982年的一个多一点，并造成了引人注目的经济后果。	The social and economic consequences of the authorities’ drastic population controls, which reduced the average fertility rate in urban households from about three in 1970 to just over one by 1982, have been dramatic.
但作为欧洲民主国家对卢卡申科全部独裁行为（其驯服的法庭、野蛮的监狱和腐败的警察）所做出的回应，这样微弱的力量还远远不够。	This meager effort, however, is an insufficient response by Europe’s democracies to the full panoply of Lukashenka’s dictatorship: his docile courts, brutal jails, and corrupt police.
可悲的是，乌克兰并不是唯一的例子：1958至1961年毛泽东在中国开展的大跃进造成的人员伤亡更大，估计导致大概1，500万到4，500万人死于非命。	Sadly, Ukraine is not the only example: The human toll in China of Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward of 1958-1961 was even greater, causing an estimated 15-45 million deaths.
在这个情况下，放扎卡耶夫回国将增加卡德罗夫的国内声望，国际曝光率及其统治合法性，这明显将令事态更为恶化。	Allowing Zakaev’s return would have worsened matters by increasing Kadyrov’s prestige at home, as well as his international visibility and legitimacy.
摒弃许多在过去50年里通过谈判达成的核武器协议的做法，使美国向北朝鲜、伊朗和其他拥有发展核武器的技术知识的国家发出了含混不清的信号。	By abandoning many of the nuclear arms agreements negotiated in the last 50 years, the United States has been sending mixed signals to North Korea, Iran, and other nations with the technical knowledge to create nuclear weapons.
内容和应用合理的监管能确保金融稳定，维持（并且在必要时重塑）市场信心，也有利于长期投资，有助于公民满足未来金融需要。	When properly drafted and applied, they ensure financial stability, maintain (and, if necessary, restore) confidence in the markets, and facilitate long-term investment, helping citizens meet their future financial needs.
为抵制民粹主义反弹，我们欧洲民众应当在拒绝自降身份等同于民粹主义分子的同时，更加大声地宣扬欧盟的美德。	To resist the populist backlash, we Europeans should be proclaiming the EU’s virtues more loudly, without descending to the populists’ level.
在制定后2015年发展议程时，各国领导人必须认识到少些暴力、多些和谐的社会能为经济发展提供的巨大动力。	In formulating the post-2015 development agenda, world leaders must recognize the tremendous impetus that less violent, more harmonious societies would provide for economic development.
这很可能会导致经济竞争力的慢慢消失。 这一更大的危险目前却因为欧盟资金的补贴所带来的，也是帮助政府得以维系公众支持的经济的暂时繁荣而被掩盖了。	This will likely result in a gradual loss of economic competitiveness ­– all the more dangerous for being obscured by the temporary boost from EU funds, which will help maintain the government’s popular support.
当前五年计划的目标是减少煤炭和钢铁行业产能过剩、 划定和重组走没有挽救价值的僵尸国有企业，并投入资金帮助受影响工人。	The current Five-Year Plan aims to reduce excess capacity in the coal and steel sectors, identify and restructure nonviable “zombie” SOEs, and fund programs to support affected workers.
（在1988年公民投票中）击败皮诺切特（并在1989年大选中击败其总统候选人）的中左翼联盟十分明智，他们坚持并在某些情况下深化了从军政府那里承袭下来的有效的自由市场政策。	The center-left coalition that defeated Pinochet (in a 1988 plebiscite and his presidential candidate in the 1989 election) has been wise enough to keep, and in some cases deepen, the sound free-market policies inherited from the military government.
第三，中国的援助谈判较少繁文缛节，不像其他援助项目那样充斥着冗长的谈判和堆积如山的项目文件，而后者被许多学者和项目执行者讥之为“支票外交 ” 。	Third, Chinese aid is dispensed rather quickly and unceremoniously, lacking the burdensome fanfare of lengthy negotiations and voluminous project documents, a practice many scholars and practitioners term “checkbook diplomacy.”
这是一种因为我们共同生活在一起而拥有的身份，并且应该是我们共同拥有的身份，不管我们不同的身份之间有多大的差异。	It is an identity we share by living together and by what we have in common, whatever the differences between our multiples identities.
不过在年度数据之外，中国最近也公布了其12月份数据，其中月度报告零售额同比增长9.4 ％ ， 有点令人失望。	Yet, in addition to its annualized data, China also recently reported its December data, which revealed monthly reported-retail-sales growth of a slightly disappointing 9.4% year on year.
如果非洲能够实现能源组合再平衡，逐渐摆脱碳氢化合物，那么这些补贴就能转作其他用途，产生环境和经济效益。	If the continent could rebalance its energy portfolio, moving away from hydrocarbons slowly, those subsidies could be reallocated in ways that would yield both environmental and economic benefits.
当然，中国在中东的成功需要在减少该地区紧张局势、给热点降温、稳定较弱国家等方面取得进展 — — 所有这些都需要众多行动方的明智外交政策。	Of course, China’s success in the Middle East requires progress on mitigating the region’s tensions, cooling its hotspots, and stabilizing weak countries – all of which will require smart diplomacy by many actors.
特朗普政府迄今为止的一种谈判技巧是提供友谊和温暖的话语，诸如此类的话语美国官员以前从未对朝鲜领导人说过。	One of the Trump administration’s negotiating tactics so far has been to offer friendship and warm words, the likes of which have never before been uttered by US officials to North Korean leaders.
巴西企业，特别是建筑公司，在委内瑞拉的投资及承建项目很多。 卢拉也利用其与卡斯特罗兄弟和查韦斯的关系平息党内左翼势力对其务实经济政策的不满。	A signatory in the 1960’s of the Tlatelolco Treaty, which banned nuclear weapons from Latin America, Brazil dismantled its enrichment process and research facilities during the 1990’s and ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1998.
临近的俄罗斯则越来越像总统弗拉迪米尔·普京的个人秀，此人似乎有意重燃与美国之间的冷战，而不是构建反映俄罗斯不断衰落现实的可行性战略关系。	Nearby Russia is increasingly a one-man-show under President Vladimir Putin, who seems intent on refighting the Cold War with the US, rather than constructing viable strategic relationships that reflect Russia’s diminished reality.
丹佛 — — 美国总统唐纳德·特朗普已决定拒绝承认伊朗履行了限制其核武计划相关协议《全面联合行动计划 》 （ JCPOA）的规定。	DENVER – US President Donald Trump has decided not to certify that Iran is in compliance with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the agreement constraining Iran’s nuclear-weapons program.
即使有，确保劳动者 — — 特别是那些以前从事常规性工作的人 — — 能够填补新的数字辅助式岗位也会是一项重大挑战。	And, even if there are, ensuring that workers – particularly those who previously held routine jobs – can fill the new digitally assisted positions represents a major challenge.
但是还没有一位能代表全欧洲声音的政治家出现，也没有任何欧洲主要组织有勇气对当前形势发表自己的见解，更不用说对将来提议一个战略性计划。	But no pan-European statesman has emerged, and no major European institution has even had the courage to provide its own analysis of the current situation, much less propose a strategic scenario for the future.
但在外资流入及经济增长领域该协定的效果却令人失望。 20年来墨西哥2.6%的年均增长率排在秘鲁、智利、哥伦比亚、巴西和乌拉圭之后。	But it proved to be a great disappointment in terms of foreign investment inflows and economic growth, which has averaged 2.6% per year over the last two decades – slower than Peru, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, and Uruguay.
这个小集团很快扩展到7个国家，后来又增加了议事范围和成员 — — 加入了俄罗斯以及一套庞大的官僚执行和宣传机构 — — 并最终形成了G8.	The group soon grew to seven, and later broadened in scope and membership – including Russia and a vast bureaucratic and press apparatus – to become the G-8.
为了能在2030年前实现联合国可持续发展计划制定的“全民教育目标 ” ， 像桥梁合作伙伴关系学校这样大胆的解决方案必须为教育工作者所接受。	To achieve “education for all” by 2030, the target set by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, educators must embrace bold solutions like Bridge Partnership Schools.
这对朝鲜而言无异于自寻死路；而对经济快速发展、自由贸易协定不断扩大的韩国，机会成本同样高得不可思议。	For the North, it would be suicide; for the South, with its vibrant economy and widening free-trade agreements, the opportunity cost would be particularly high.
即使特朗普当选总统，其禁止穆斯林入境和要求墨西哥出钱修围墙阻止移民的提案也不太可能通过宪法或政治审核。	Trump’s proposal to bar Muslims from entering the US and his demands that Mexico pay for a wall to stop migration would be unlikely to pass constitutional or political muster were he elected President.
但实际上这三个正在各自国家引发争议的问题并不真正与宗教信仰自由相关，因此提醒我们宗教自由的概念正在遭到滥用。	But the fact that these three issues, all currently causing controversy in their respective countries, are not really about the freedom to practice one’s religion, suggests that the appeal to religious freedom is being misused.
蒲林尼在1世纪时写道 ： “ 印度每年从罗马拿走5000万塞斯特斯，没有哪一年不是这样 。 ” 印度-罗马的贸易失衡让罗马的金币和银币持续流失，造成了金银的短缺。	As Pliny wrote in the first century: “Not a year passed in which India did not take 50 million sesterces away from Rome.” That trade imbalance implied a continuous drain on gold and silver coin, causing shortages of these metals in Rome.
他们隔壁的邻居丧生，当第二天早晨发现尸体时，他们蜷缩在一起，他们年仅三岁的女儿令人心碎地被拥抱在当中。	Their next-door neighbors perished; when their corpses were discovered the next morning, they were crouched together, their three-year-old girl in the middle of a heartbreaking huddle.
如果持有者如今认定反对置换能令自己更可能在延长时间的情况下全额收回债务，那么就更加难以对主权债务进行重组并令债务国经济重回正轨。	If creditors now believe that holding out makes it more likely that they will receive full value at a later date, restructuring sovereign debt and restoring a debtor economy’s normal functioning will be more difficult.
他辛苦对抗美国权力的企图同样是短视的：帮助伊朗发展核项目并向中国出售高科技武器决不符合俄罗斯的长期战略利益。	His embittered attempts to counter American power are equally short-sighted: helping Iran develop its nuclear program and selling high-tech weapons to China are hardly in Russia’s long-term strategic interest.
现在欧洲的武器可能落在中国人手里，并瞄准着保卫一个2300万人口的民主国家（换句话说，这相当于北欧国家的人口之和）的美国军队。	Now it may be European arms in the hands of the Chinese that will be aimed at American troops protecting a democracy with 23 million inhabitants (in other words, as many people as in all the Nordic countries combined).
这也能够解释他们为什么在反对伊朗核野心的问题上试图获得政治支持，伊朗的核野心每隔一段时间就会威胁到以色列，而且不时宣称要将这个国家从地球上彻底抹去。	That is why they have tried to obtain political support against the nuclear ambitions of Iran, which periodically threatens Israel, at times proclaiming its desire to wipe it off the face of the earth.
明显这是一个巨大的代价，相当于欧盟总成本提高至少50 % 。 而且，还有可能更高(欧盟委员会以前估计成本是目前估计的一倍 ) 。	This is obviously a hefty price tag – at least a 50% increase in the total cost of the EU – and it will likely be much higher (the Commission has previously estimated the cost to be double its current estimate).
第六，政府负债率的上升会最终导致实际利率的上升，而实际利率的上升会压缩私人开支，甚至会导致国家再融资的风险。	Sixth, rising government debt ratios will eventually lead to increases in real interest rates that may crowd out private spending and even lead to sovereign refinancing risk.
相反，他很可能将提出用中国在朝鲜问题上的合作来换取美国停止在韩国部署末段高空区域防御（即萨德）反导系统。	Instead, he will probably offer China’s cooperation in exchange for the US halting its deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea.
它可以在极权主义席卷美国（特朗普的“美国优先”方针）和中国（正从一党制向单一领袖政权转变）袖手旁观。	It can stand by as nationalism and authoritarianism flourish from the United States (with Donald Trump’s “America First” approach) to China (which is moving from a single-party system to a single-leader regime).
家庭形成速度的下降 — — 比如，年青一代美国人越来越多地搬回家去和父母同住 — — 抑制了房价，导致了更多的人被剥夺了按揭权。	Decreased rates of household formation – young Americans, for example, are increasingly moving back in with their parents – depress housing prices, leading to still more foreclosures.
之后迪克松给我讲述了一个和他的委托人有关的典型事例，其中的主人公玛吉德·汗是一名所谓“高价值的在押犯 ” ， 他在中央情报局的“黑据点”已被关押三年之久。	Dixon then told me a revealing story of one of his clients, Majid Khan, a so-called “high-value detainee” who was held for three years in CIA “black sites.”
墨西哥黄豆、南亚香米、玻利维亚昆诺阿藜、亚马逊卡皮木、印度鹰嘴豆、秘鲁努纳豆、安第斯玛卡 — — 都曾经经历过掠夺性的知识产权诉求。	Mexican beans, South Asian basmati rice, Bolivian quinoa, Amazonian ayahuasca, Indian chickpeas, Peruvian nuña beans, Andean maca – all have been subject to predatory intellectual property claims.
每个阵营在两位可怕的女领袖的领导下轮流控制过政府：现任总理、人民联盟（Awami League）的谢赫·哈西娜·瓦吉德（Sheikh Hasina Wazed）以及在她之前连任两届的孟加拉国民党（Bangladesh Nationalist Party）的比格姆·卡勒达·齐亚（Begum Khaleda Zia ） 。	Each camp has taken its turn controlling the government, under two formidable female leaders: the Awami League’s Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the current prime minister, and her two-term predecessor, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s Begum Khaleda Zia.
可以肯定的是，价格歧视不会发生在每件商品和服务上，而这种趋势可能会受到线下零售商或新进入者通过向每个人提供更低价格争夺市场份额的竞争冲击。	To be sure, price discrimination will not happen for every good and service, and the trend could be tempered by competition from offline retailers or new entrants vying for market share by offering lower prices to everyone.
一国债务负担的挑战反映了其基本预算余额（预算余额减去利息支出）占GDP的比重规模以及其借贷成本与其GDP增长率之差。	The change in a country’s debt burden reflects the size of its primary budget balance (the balance minus interest payments) as a share of GDP, as well as the difference between its borrowing costs and its GDP growth rate.
与此同时，卫生当局和政府采取了基于恐惧（fear-based）方针，忙不迭地监管 — — 乃至禁止 — — PNV。	Meanwhile, health authorities and governments have adopted a fear-based approach, scrambling to regulate – or even ban – PNVs.
伊朗总统内贾德或许由于其对美国的强烈批评而在整个穆斯林世界赢得支持，但是在伊朗国内，他却在丧失实力。	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad may be gaining support across the Muslim world for his fervent criticism of the United States, but inside Iran, he is losing strength.
截止8月3日前100个交易日的每日股价变化在阿根廷、澳大利亚、巴西、加拿大、中国、法国、德国、印度、日本、韩国、墨西哥、美国和英国都呈现出不寻常的负偏态。	Daily stock price changes for the 100-business-day period ending August 3 were unusually negatively skewed in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the United States and the United Kingdom.
与儿童相关的部门，如教育和体育，显然必须进行这样的评估，但只要具有永久性权力差别的运营特征的组织，都必须进行这样的评估。	Such reviews are needed not just in obviously child-related sectors, like education or sports, but wherever power differentials are a permanent feature of operations.
而这将通过协助确保金枪鱼种群实现可持续捕捞、要求在上述水域捕鱼的外国船只仅在法律允许的范围内实施捕捞来促进该地区的未来繁荣。	And it would promote future prosperity by helping to ensure that tuna stocks are fished sustainably, and that foreign vessels fishing in these waters do not take more than is permitted by law.
由本人担任联合主席同时迪顿参与的经济表现和社会进步国际测定委员会早前就强调，GDP往往不是衡量社会福祉的优秀指标。	The international Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, which I co-chaired and on which Deaton served, had earlier emphasized that GDP often is not a good measure of a society’s wellbeing.
最明显的是，奥巴马政府不得不缺席十月在巴厘岛举行的亚太经济合作组织（APEC）峰会，阻碍了美国���主导的跨太平洋伙伴关系的进程。	Most visibly, the Obama administration had to cancel its participation at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bali in October, impeding progress on the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.
比如，地区性青蒿素耐药性计划致力于阻止耐青蒿素疟疾在湄公河三角洲地区的传播。 该计划监控和共享耐药性数据，推广抗疟疾疗法的合理使用。	For example, the Regional Artemisinin-Resistance Initiative is working to halt the spread of resistant malaria in the Mekong Delta region, by monitoring and sharing drug-resistance data and promoting proper use of antimalarial treatments.
当然，如果伊朗没有核武器，世界可能会更安全一些，这不是因为伊朗是一个“流氓”国家，而是因为任何核武器的扩散都可能使世界更危险。	Of course, the world would be safer if Iran did not have nuclear weapons, not because it is a “rogue” state, but because any spread of nuclear weapons is likely to make the world more dangerous.
如果不是让某种形式的野蛮变得不可接受（这种野蛮偶尔露出人脸，这不应该让我们忘记人们正在以它的名义杀戮、伤害和强奸 ） ， 勒庞和班巴萨在做什么？	What were Le Pen and Benbassa doing if not making acceptable a form of barbarism whose occasionally human face should never allow us to forget that people are killing, maiming, and raping in its name?
保守党成为议员所需要比工党赢得更多选票，因为城市英国居民拥有过多的代表权，而工党在不少英国选区占据多数优势。	It takes more votes to elect a Conservative than a Labour MP, owing to the over-representation of urban Britain and some majority-Labour parts of the country.
这一职位将在外交政策高级代表（根据新的改革协定的规定，外交政策高级代表将成为欧盟委员会的副主席）的领导下工作，能够起到加强欧盟内部协同一致的作用。	Working under the authority of the High Representative on Foreign Policy, who under the terms of the new reform treaty will also become a Vice-President of the European Commission, this post would reinforce synergies within the EU.
国民议会可以按照宪法规定任命新一届政府，而新政府反过来又可以邀请包括拉美、北美和欧洲国家在内的自愿联盟提供军事协作。	The Assembly could constitutionally appoint a new government, which in turn could request military assistance from a coalition of the willing, including Latin American, North American, and European countries.
伟大的书、音乐和绘画不仅是非比寻常的真善美学校，也是我们自身真善美的发现之路 — — 它们给我们带来改变潜能，完善我们甚至我们的对话者。	Great books, music, and paintings are not only an extraordinary school of beauty, truth, and good, but also a way of discovering our own beauty, truth, and good – the potential for change, of bettering ourselves and even some of our interlocutors.
市场只有在制度及法律框架下才能起作用，其中包括产权、合同的强制执行、质量和信息控制及许多其它用来管理交易的法规。	Markets can function only within an institutional and legal framework that includes property rights, enforcement of contracts, quality and information controls, and many other rules to govern transactions.
欧洲已经面临许多重大挑战，包括俄罗斯入侵乌克兰、英国脱欧、民粹主义和民族主义的兴起以及低迷的经济增长速度。	And Europe is already confronting many significant challenges, including Russian aggression against Ukraine, Brexit, the rise of populism and nationalism, and low rates of economic growth.
官方对相关新闻的封锁（该事件就发生在北京奥运会之前）不仅导致了许多婴儿的死亡，也令中国老百姓更加不相信政府。	Official suppression of news about the incident (which occurred just before the Beijing Olympics) not only led to the deaths of many infants, but also left ordinary Chinese even more distrustful of the authorities.
有些人可能会怀疑希腊的债务其实是可持续的，因为该国政府所以支付的利息比葡萄牙和意大利这两个债务水平远低于希腊的国家所需支付的更少。	Some might suspect that Greece’s debt is sustainable, since the Greek government has to pay less in interest than Portugal or Italy, both of which have much lower debt levels.
在贸易方面，美国总统特朗普不断升级的对华贸易战升级正在占据新闻头条，但特朗普在远非批评中国的唯一一人。	When it comes to trade, US President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war with China is grabbing headlines, but Trump is far from alone in criticizing China.
如果巴勒斯坦，在以色列的占领下，还能选择他们自己的领袖，为什么开罗、大马士革、利雅特或者阿尔及尔就不可以呢？	If the Palestinians, under Israeli occupation, can choose their own leaders, why can't the same happen in Cairo or Damascus, in Ryadh or Algiers?
第一是考虑到享有自由取款的储户及其他债权人。 一个具保护能力的政府可能需要防止债权人无效率的“挤兑”金融企业资产，因为如果某个金融机构产生“挤兑 ” ， 将会引发其他银行发生类似的情况。	Second, most small creditors are “non-adjusting,” in the sense that they are unable to monitor and study the financial institution’s situation when agreeing to do business with it.
事实上，联邦预算委员会的经验规则表明，真实GDP增长率持续短缺1个百分点相当于在10年的时间里增加大约3万亿美元的预算赤字。	Indeed, a CBO rule of thumb equates a sustained one-percentage-point shortfall in real GDP growth with budget deficits that are roughly $3 trillion larger over a ten-year period.
如果被毁坏前人口减少的城镇在重建时能够实现转型，可能会创造出新的地区发展模式，实现此前以东京为核心经济布局的分散化。	If towns suffering from depopulation before they were destroyed are transformed in their reconstruction, they could mark the emergence of a new model for regional development that can decentralize Japan’s Tokyo-centric economy.
但因为继续加深经济主权一体化是解决欧元区困境的唯一长期方案，所以这样的改革不会很快达到目标。 欧洲央行的作用也因此变得极为关键。	But, while greater merging of economic sovereignty is the only long-term solution to the eurozone’s woes, such reforms cannot happen very quickly, which is why the ECB’s role is so crucial.
如果我们不希望事情迅速变得棘手，现在是再次关注波斯尼亚的时候了，因为现在全世界都知道情形恶化会付出多么大的代价。	It's time to pay attention to Bosnia again, if we don't want things to get nasty very quickly. By now, the entire world knows the price of that.
“现在在我们国家 ， ” 布什在对党内保守派的演讲中提到 ， “ 如果你出生在贫穷的家庭，如果你的父母没上过大学，如果你连自己的父亲是谁都不知道，如果你家里不说英语，那么你成功的机会就很渺茫 。 ”	“In our country today,” Bush said in a speech to fellow conservatives, “if you’re born poor, if your parents didn’t go to college, if you don’t know your father, if English isn’t spoken at home, then the odds are stacked against you.”
只有当一个公司获得了公众的信心 — — 它的“经营许可 ” — —那它的管理者才可以为所有利益相关者创造长期价值，包括股东。	Only when a company has gained the public’s confidence – its “license to operate” – can its management create long-term value for all stakeholders, including shareholders.
纽约—我拥有纽约市的一套公寓已近四十年，但我实际住在其中的日子还不到一半，因为我的旅行日程十分繁忙。	NEW YORK – I have had the same apartment in New York City for almost 40 years but have actually lived in it for less than half of that time, owing to a busy travel schedule.
因此，中国和俄罗斯解决边界争端的主要目的不是为了建立地缘政治婚姻，以保护双方的后方并为双方发展其他地方的机会腾出手来。	Thus, the settling of the border dispute with Russia was not aimed so much at building a geopolitical marriage as securing each other’s rear, offering both sides a free hand to explore opportunities elsewhere.
随着该国无声的政治革命继续展开，问题在于他们是否留意到了这些迹象，还是企图维持一种像法国君主制一样无可救药的秩序。	As the country’s silent political revolution continues to unfold, the question is whether they will heed its signs, or attempt to maintain an order that – like the French monarchy – cannot be saved.
我们的计算表明，如果该协议得到实施，则其他种类的债券将基本什么也得不到（假设债务重组的重点是恢复波多黎各债务的可持续性 ） 。	As our computations show, if such a deal were to be implemented, there would be virtually nothing left for the other categories of bonds (assuming that the point of the debt restructuring is to restore the sustainability of the island’s debt).
与此同时，美联储主席珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen ） （ 最后终于）作出了正确的决定，推动美联储的政策正常化，终结了一个早该因一无是处而刹车的错误实验。	In the meantime, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is right (finally) to push the Fed to normalize policy, putting an end to a failed experiment that has long outlived its usefulness.
美联储主席伯南克现在极为担忧，除非大幅度降息，否则，美国经济中的房地产市场以及房屋贷款中的问题将会导致经济衰退，即使降息意味着某些通货膨胀的风险。	Fed chairman Ben Bernanke is now extremely concerned that the economy’s housing market and mortgage problems will cause a recession unless interest rates are aggressively cut even if this means taking some risks with inflation.
发自莫斯科 — — 西方人总喜欢把俄罗斯政治圈的一切事情都解读成自由派和保守派的高层斗争：戈尔巴乔夫时代是利加乔夫和雅克福列夫之争；叶利钦治下是改革派和国家主义者互斗；到了普京时代则是“西罗维基 ” （ siloviki,意指由前苏联安全和军事部门组成的“强力集团 ” ） 和经济自由主义者针锋相对。	Moscow – Westerners often see Russian politics in terms of a high-level struggle between liberals and conservatives: Ligachev and Yakovlev under Gorbachev; reformers and nationalists under Yeltsin; siloviki and economic liberals under Putin.
两年后，时任国际货币基金组织（IMF）总裁多米尼克·斯特劳斯·卡恩（Dominique Strauss Kahn）被问及如何看待IMF在2008年后的角色。	Two years later, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then-Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, was asked what he thought the IMF’s post-2008 role ought to be.
但更重要的是，43%的非洲人将上升至中上阶层， 而该数据在2013年仅为39.6 % ， 而这意味着对商品和服务的需求将大幅增加。	But, more important, 43% of Africans will belong to the middle or upper classes, up from 39.6% in 2013, implying considerably higher demand for goods and services.
因此，不久前公布的对其有效性的质疑令人震惊 — — 同样令人震惊的还有去年2月发表的加拿大国家乳腺筛查研究25年随访记录。	That is why recent doubts about its effectiveness – intensified by the publication in February of the 25-year follow-up to the Canadian National Breast Screening Study – have come as such a shock.
许多联合国成员国相信，联合国的内部权力在从联合国大会转移出来，因而拒不放弃它们所认为的最后一点权限，也就是通过大会第五委员会的工作控制预算。	Many UN members, believing that power within the UN has been shifting from the General Assembly, resist giving up what they regard as its last vestige: control over the budget through the work of the Assembly’s Fifth Committee.
德尔维什，世界银行前任副行长，曾在普林斯顿大学任教，并在任土耳其经济事务部部长时使土耳其成功地度过了一次危机。 为什么全世界不接受具备这些才干的候选人，而要满足于接受别人呢？	Why should the world settle for anything less than candidates of this caliber?
自1953年朝鲜战争休战协定签署以来，三八线便一直是美军行动的界线；朝鲜战争对中国的重要性决不能忘记。	After the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953, the 38th parallel was established as the limit for US forces’ presence; the importance of that war for China should not be forgotten.
该组织认为，资本账户自由化有利有弊，因此“自由化需要进行周密策划，制定时间表，并循序渐进以保证其利大于弊 ” 。	The IMF now recognizes that capital-account liberalization comes with risks as well as benefits, and that “liberalization needs to be well planned, timed, and sequenced in order to ensure that its benefits outweigh the costs.”
IMF的模拟测试结果表明，全球增长率下降1.5个百分点将通过其对贸易和金融流的影响，光是在2012年就将造成270亿美元的外部融资缺口。	Simulations by the International Monetary Fund suggest that a decline in global growth of 1.5 percentage points could, owing to its impact on trade and financial flows, generate a $27 billion gap in additional external financing in 2012 alone.
哪些经济政策能最好地确保社会公平和惠及广大埃及人民的繁荣？ 是中央计划体制，还是自由经济，还是两者的结合？	Which economic policies – statist, liberal, or some combination of the two – will best ensure social justice and broad distribution of prosperity?
上海 — — 随着现有的国际秩序变得更加四分五裂，强势全球治理机构对迎接世界战略、经济和可持续发展挑战起着至关重要的作用。	SHANGHAI – As the existing international order becomes more fragmented, strong global-governance institutions are crucial for addressing the world’s strategic, economic, and sustainability challenges.
越来越多的证据表明气候变化和海平面上升、热浪、干旱和降雨强度之间的确具有某种联系，而且尽管对飓风和龙卷风的科学研究还无法得出确凿的结论，但这种情况也有可能改变。	There is growing evidence of links between climate change and sea-level rise, heat waves, droughts, and rainfall intensity, and, although scientific research on hurricanes and tornadoes is not as conclusive, that may be changing.
以暴动为例，1870年制定了一项镇压对英国警察的批评的严苛的反暴动法律，任何批评，甚至如一位直率的英国人所指出的，不包括“绝对违反和平”的批评，都是镇压对象。	Consider sedition, against which a draconian law that was established in 1870 to suppress any criticism of British policies – even criticism that, as one Briton candidly put it, did not involve “an absolute breach of the peace.”
在世界杯落幕之后 ， “ 奶奶帮 ” （ 祖鲁语为“Vakhegula Vakhegula ” ， 意为“老奶奶 ” ） 这支由50至84岁老球员组成的女子足球队将奔赴美国争夺“耆耄杯 ” （ Veteran’s Cup ） 。	After the World Cup, Vakhegula Vakhegula (The Grannies), a team of women between 50 and 84 years old, will travel to the US to play in the Veteran’s Cup.
比如，在GBIRd工程上，我们可以问问“生不出女儿的老鼠”是否会从引入它们的生态系统中逃逸 — — 转基因庄稼和养殖三文鱼就发生过这种情况 — — 以及如果逃逸会发生什么。	When it comes to the GBIRd project, for example, one might ask whether the “daughterless mouse” could escape the specific ecosystem into which it has been introduced, just as GMO crops and farmed salmon do, and what would happen if it did.
不论如何，比起披着不可预测的市场后果外衣的暗箱操作，我们还是对由民选代表所做政治决策的正确性和恰当性更有信心。	Rightly or wrongly, we have more confidence in the correctness and appropriateness of political decisions made by democratically-elected representatives than of decisions implicitly made as the unanticipated consequences of market processes.
比如，出资者可能允许修葺现有实验室，但不允许建设新实验室；或者资金可以用于支持采购诊断机器，但不能用于培训这些机器的操作员。	A funder may, for example, allow the renovation of an existing lab but not the construction of a new one; or funds may support the purchase of a diagnostic machine but not the training of those required to operate it.
经济衰退只会让就业和工作更为险峻和不稳定，造成社会关系紧张。 而社会关系紧张当然无法帮助减轻金融危机。	A recession will only increase job precariousness and unemployment, creating social tensions that will not, of course, help to ease the financial crisis.
公众对于非法入境问题的抗议声越来越大，但是对怎样处理那些已经在国内非法居住了数年或者未来想要到美国来的那些人并没有达成一致的意见。	There is growing opposition to illegal entry, but no consensus about what to do about those who have been in the country illegally for years or those who want to come to the US in the future.
X奖基金会（X Prize Foundation）曾近推行过这一想法，但在出资人失去兴趣后不了了之。	The X Prize Foundation once promoted this idea, but dropped it when a funder lost interest.
各大基金会往往发现这些投资工具可以帮助它们做好事，一方面借助它们在慈善事业上花费的金钱，另一方面则借助那些可以产生回报来资助慈善活动的捐赠资产。	Foundations often find that these investment vehicles help them to do good both with the money that they spend on philanthropy and with the endowment assets that yield the returns on which their philanthropy depends.
纽约—正在乌克兰逐渐升级的冲突 — — 一方是西方支持的政府，另一方是俄罗斯支持的分裂主义者 — — 让人们开始关注一个根本问题：克里姆林宫的长期目标是什么？	NEW YORK – The escalating conflict in Ukraine between the Western-backed government and Russian-backed separatists has focused attention on a fundamental question: What are the Kremlin’s long-term objectives?
而后在2018年2月，卡马最先打破非洲领导人的沉默，呼吁民主刚果共和国专制总统约瑟夫·卡比拉“交权 。 ”	Then, in February 2018, Khama broke the silence among African leaders and called for Joseph Kabila, the autocratic president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, to “relinquish power.”
当立陶宛及其他一些波罗的海国家，如爱沙尼亚和拉脱维亚这些在二战期间被斯大林占领的国家，抓住了1990至1991年的机会成为独立国后，克里姆林宫再也坐不住了。	When Lithuania and then the other Baltic States – Estonia and Latvia – which were occupied by Stalin early in WWII, seized their opportunity for freedom in 1990-91, the Kremlin did not sit on its hands.
但是，作为总统候选人，他加入了否认阵营 — — 这是他8月份在佛罗里达州坦帕接受党内提名后做出的改变。	As a presidential candidate, however, he joined the deniers – a switch made clear when he accepted the party’s nomination in Tampa, Florida, in August.
当我询问郭国际社会能为让推特在中国普及做些什么时，他回答说我们可以“提供价格便宜的虚拟专用网络 。 ”	When I asked Guo how the outside world could make Twitter more accessible in China, he replied that we could help by “providing affordable VPN service.”
欧元区从技术上走出了衰退，美国的失业率也比前几年低，日本也在长期萎靡和2011年地震和海啸冲击之后开始觉醒。	The eurozone technically emerged from recession, the unemployment rate in the United States was lower than in previous years, and Japan began to stir after a long slumber and the negative shock of the earthquake and tsunami in 2011.
与此同时，我们清楚世界上很大一部分人口依然生活在非常恶劣的条件下，有超过10亿人生活在贫困之中，20亿人没有电，还有30亿人喝不到干净的水以及没有很好的卫生条件。	All the while, we know of the terrible conditions that still face the majority of the world’s population, with more than a billion poor, two billion without electricity, and three billion without clean drinking water and sanitation.
投资驱动的经济发展不能取代冲突化解和政治稳定；恰恰相反，如果后者迟迟不能向前推进前者所取得的进展很可能也无法维系。	Investment-driven growth is no substitute for conflict resolution and political stabilization; on the contrary, the former cannot be sustained without progress on the latter.
现在是时候启动协调一致的全球行动，保护海洋中某些最古老、最脆弱 — — 也是最宝贵的 — — 鲨鱼种群。	It is time to launch concerted global efforts to protect some of the oldest, most vulnerable – and most valuable – species in our seas.
但今天，科研工作在外界的误导下越来越注重丰厚的奖励、专业领域的认可和财务收益 — — 这些世俗的回报正在扼杀科学进步所必须的激情和创造力。	But, nowadays, research increasingly is misdirected toward lucrative prizes, professional recognition, and financial gains – rewards that are suffocating the creativity and passion that scientific progress demands.
建设选项不足可能是推高房价-收入比的因素，住房价格长期总会上涨，即便城市无法吸引到新的产业、声望或人才。	Insufficient options for construction can be the driving force behind a rising price-to-income ratio, with home prices increasing over the long term even if the city has acquired no new industry, cachet, or talent.
对科尔来说，一个紧密统一的欧洲是一个深刻的感情问题（deeply emotional matter ） ， 也是欧洲的和平和德国的福祉的关键条件。	For Kohl, a closely united Europe was a deeply emotional matter, as well as the key condition for Europe’s peace and Germany’s wellbeing.
在刚刚在德国波恩结束的联合国气候变化会议上，全球领导人重申，如果政府继续忽视如何管理森林、农场和海岸的问题，世界就无法对升温做出足够的应对。	At the UN climate change meeting that just concluded in Bonn, Germany, global leaders reaffirmed that the world cannot respond adequately to rising temperatures if governments continue ignoring how forests, farms, and coasts are managed.
这种不平衡状况已促使一些政府提高退休年龄并修改养老金政策，以延缓或减少福利发放并将老年人留在就业队伍之中。	This imbalance has already driven some governments to raise their retirement ages and change their pension policies to delay or reduce benefits and keep people in the workforce.
被质疑进行国际干预的政府急切地渴望更加严格的全球规则以防止银行危机溢出国界，像亚洲流感一样传染给其他国家。	Governments that had been suspicious of international interference were eager for tougher global rules to prevent banking crises from spilling across borders and infecting others, like bouts of Asian flu.
此外高油价会鼓励其他新增产量来源（最顺理成章的莫过于页岩油）从而抵消了有利的需求效应，甚至可能起到反效果。	Add to that the increased production from alternative sources (most consequentially, shale) that higher prices encouraged, and the beneficial demand effects are offset, if not overwhelmed.
哈马斯坚称巴民族权力机构主席阿巴斯根本没有代表巴人谈判的合法性，因此他与以色列达成的任何协议都是无效的。	Hamas insists that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas does not have the legitimacy to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians, and that any deal he reaches with Israel is not binding.
此外，12月美国宣布向马政府出售价值18.3亿美元的武器同样明确表示了对台湾的支持，此举似乎已经准备放弃国民党。	Moreover, the announcement in December that the US is to sell $1.83 billion in weapons to the Ma government is also a clear show of support for Taiwan, which already appeared ready to renounce the Kuomintang.
坎布里奇 — — 在美国当选总统唐纳德·特朗普筹备其内阁对华政策时，他应当警惕历史为他设置的两大陷阱。	CAMBRIDGE – As US President-elect Donald Trump prepares his administration’s policy toward China, he should be wary of two major traps that history has set for him.
如果非洲各国政府坦然接受发电和供电方式的多样性，就能为千百万人提供现代能源，同时让非洲位列全球能源转型前沿。	If African governments embrace diversity in the way electricity is generated and distributed, they could provide modern energy to millions of people, while placing the continent at the forefront of a global energy transformation.
同样，虽然2006年的欧洲酷热状况有所减轻，水和气温问题依然迫使德国，西班牙和法国关停部分核电站并减少其他核电站的发电功率。	Similarly, although the 2006 European heat wave was less intense, water and heat problems forced Germany, Spain, and France to take some nuclear power plants offline and reduce operations at others.
虽然威胁退出WTO即使作为一项谈判战略也没有任何意义，更不用说作为一项政策了，但这种状况仍然可能发生，并为美国经济和世界的影响带来灾难性的后果。	Threatening to leave the WTO makes no sense even as a negotiating strategy, let alone as a policy, but it could still happen. The consequences for the US economy and for the world could be calamitous.
并且不要忘了，2015年约翰·博纳（John Boehner）之所以失去众议长之位，部分原因就在于他的党派的右翼挑起了类似的预算纷争。	And remember that John Boehner stepped down as Speaker of the House in 2015 in part over similar budget struggles with the right wing of his party.
分属40个偏远贫困村的6,000名成年人每天能领取75美分（没错，是美分 ） — —折合每月22美元 — — 连续领12年。	In 40 poor, remote villages, 6,000 adults are now receiving 75 cents (yes, cents) per day – or $22 per month for 12 years.
事实上，普京上个月在俄罗斯广播节目《直线 》 （ Direct Line）上说，他赞美俄罗斯民族的血统优点。	Indeed, speaking on the Russian radio program Direct Line last month, he extolled the genetic virtues of the Russian people.
更具战略性的方针应聚焦于提振整个欧盟的增长，手段包括实现欧洲2020研究、开发和创新目标以及推进跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系（Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ） 。	A more strategic approach would focus on boosting growth throughout the EU, such as by meeting the Europe 2020 targets for research, development, and innovation, and advancing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
其中一个原因是布莱尔工党的很大一部分（布莱尔称之为“新工党 ” ） 从来都没有接受布莱尔将自由市场原则放置于旧的社会党或者社会民主党价值观念之上。	One reason is that a significant portion of Blair’s party (which he renamed “New Labor”) never reconciled itself to the primacy that he gave to free-market principles over its old Socialist or Social Democratic values.
前世贸组织总干事雷米（Pascal Lamy）曾经承认，尽管中国在落实世贸组织承诺长清单方面做得“着实不错 ” ， 但“没有一个国家可以摆脱批评 ” 。	As former WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy once acknowledged, while China has done “really well” in implementing its long list of WTO commitments, “no country is above criticism.”
根据这种观点，当巴菲特在60年代挣到他的一开始的几百万美元后，他积累更多金钱的努力似乎可以很轻易地被看作是完全没有意义的。	From this perspective, once Buffett earned his first few millions in the 1960’s, his efforts to accumulate more money can easily seem completely pointless.
实际上在上个月，美国国务院最高外国援助顾问脱拜尔斯在承认他使用了据称是提供“性爱幻想”的陪伴服务后辞职，尽管他说他只是接受了按摩。	Indeed, last month, Randall Tobias, the top foreign aid adviser in the US State Department, resigned after acknowledging that he had used an escort service described as providing “high-end erotic fantasy” – although Tobias said he only had a massage.
目前，这一宣传丝毫没有减弱迹象，而只要普京的围困叙事战略继续产生政治红利，这一状况也不太可能发生改变。	So far, there has been no diminuendo, and there is unlikely to be one so long as Putin’s siege narrative strategy continues to yield political dividends.
但是，更重要的原因是，即使罚金高达43亿美元，与大银行在过去五年来所支付的总罚金和诉讼成本来说也只是九牛一毛。	The more important reason, though, is that even $4.3 billion is small change when compared to the total fines and litigation costs incurred by the major banks over the last five years.
因此，债券市场似乎即将迎来重大调整，许多人认为可能发生市场崩盘，拉低其他长期资产如房地产和股票的价格。	So, with the bond market appearing ripe for a dramatic correction, many are wondering whether a crash could drag down markets for other long-term assets, such as housing and equities.
这一重大变化反映了FARC在长年斗争之后实力的极大削弱、哥伦比亚社会的韧性，以及（也许是最重要的）桑托斯的高明地区政策。	This momentous shift reflects the decimation of the FARC following long years of struggle, the resilience of Colombian society, and, perhaps most important, Santos’s brilliant regional policy.
诚然，我们需要为重要的国际组织建立一种成员制度从而确保它们的架构是合适的，并确保有足够的灵活性允许成员更替。	Clearly, therefore, we need to devise a system of membership for key international organizations that ensures that their structures are relevant but that is also flexible enough to allow members to come and go.
30年美国国债价格之高导致其收益率只有2.3 % ； 而考虑到当前的通胀预期，收益率应该比2.3%高出一倍。	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond is so high that it implies a yield of about 2.3%; given current inflation expectations, the yield should be about twice as high.
作为总统，肯尼迪的和平观并不新鲜，但他在和平观的指导下谈判了第一个和武器控制协定 — — 《部分禁止核试验条约 》 （ Limited Test Ban Treaty ） 。	While a presidential vision of peace was not new, Kennedy followed it up by negotiating the first nuclear arms-control agreement, the Limited Test Ban Treaty.
8月，巴西当局禁止了社交网络应用Secret，因为该公司就网络暴力担忧做出回应。 以色列也在考虑类似的措施。	In August, Brazilian authorities banned the social-networking app Secret after the company failed to respond to cyberbullying concerns, with Israel considering a similar move.
事实上，子孙后代能够比当前一代从政府基础设施投资中获得更多好处，因此让他们来出基础设施的大头也是合理的。	In fact, future generations will benefit more than the current one from government infrastructure investment, so it is reasonable that they should pay for most for it.
英国独立党（UK Independence Party）党员甚至认为英国可以做得更好，许多保守党中的“欧洲怀疑派”也作如是观。	Members of the UK Independence Party even think that Britain would do better, as do a considerable number of Conservative “Euro-skeptics.”
法国的教育医保系统虽处于困境，但仍是世界上最好的系统。 法国的知识界和科学家极富创新精神，他们在许多学科领域都保持着世界领先地位。	The French will undergo major shocks in the years to come, but France might be the only European country standing tall 30 years from now.
至关重要的是，这一被称为北方强区模式的模型可与伦敦构成互补，而不是通过竞争削弱伦敦。 其目标是重建地理平衡并提升英国的总体增长表现。	After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.
IMF所辨别的第二大挑战 — — 欧元区银行体系容量过剩及相关的不良贷款问题 — — 理论上也是可以解决的。	The second big challenge that the IMF identifies – excess capacity in the eurozone banking system, and the related problem of non-performing loans – is also, in principle, solvable.
2008年一项研究发现，一个国家的教育体系质量 — — 以及毕业生的认知能力 — — 与其经济增长是高度正相关的。	One study from 2008 found that the quality of a country’s education system – and the cognitive abilities of its graduates – positively influences economic growth.
半个世纪以来，替日本制定了战后“和平”宪法的美国一直要求日本在维持亚洲和全球稳定方面扮演更重要的角色。	For a half-century, the US, which wrote Japan’s postwar “peace” constitution, has pressed the Japanese to play a greater role in maintaining Asian and global stability.
在皮库迪在2010年6月公开此项起诉之时 ， 《 科学》杂志执行出版人艾伦·莱施纳（Alan Leshner）代表美国科学促进会向意大利总统乔治·纳波利塔诺（Giorgio Napolitano）递交了公开抗议信。	After Picuti made the charges public in June 2010, Alan Leshner, Executive Publisher of Science, sent an open letter of protest to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano on behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
这次内塔尼亚胡似乎做得有些过头；在包括以色列史学家在内各派力量一个多星期的谴责后，内塔尼亚胡被迫收回其声明内容。	In this case, it seems that Netanyahu may have gone too far; after more than a week of condemnation, including from Israeli historians, he was forced to retract the statement.
即使有了官方资金援助，要神奇地连下三城 — — 将负债率和赤字率降低到可持续的水平，本币实际贬值以及重启经济增长恐怕也是很难完成的任务。	The magic trifecta of sustainable debt and deficit ratios, a real depreciation, and restoration of growth looks unlikely to be achievable even with official financial support.
环境的多边影响了工业园区项目的可行性，尽管其业务模式 — — 用朝鲜的低成本工人制造劳动密集型产品是有效的。	This challenging climate undermines the project’s viability, even though the business model – based on lower-cost workers from the North producing labor-intensive goods – makes sense.
我们将继续与土耳其国内的恐怖主义祸害作斗争，与此同时，我们呼吁所有国家不但要为巴黎死难者致哀，更要拒绝任何形式的恐怖主义。	As we continue to fight the scourge of terrorism in our country, we call on all countries not only to mourn the dead in Paris, but to reject terrorism in all of its forms.
这场争论最新的焦点是加密技术：科技公司是否应该开发加密用户信息的程序，让除了传送对象之外的所有人 — — 哪怕是政府 — — 都无法读取这些信息。	Most recently that debate has focused on encryption: whether technology companies should be able to develop programs that encrypt their users’ messages so securely that no one but their intended recipients – not even governments – can read them.
作为一名经济学家，我很高兴新《国家安全战略》对美国国家安全的经济方面给予了很大的关注，也希望这种重视能够带来更好的国内和贸易政策。	As an economist, I am pleased that the NSS has given substantial attention to the economic aspects of US national security. I hope that this emphasis leads to better domestic and trade policies.
几十年来最严重的旱灾导致绝收和牲畜大量倒闭，人们动员了近10亿美元紧急援助用于营养、卫生和清洁水供应。	As the worst drought in living memory destroyed harvests and decimated livestock, almost $1 billion was mobilized in emergency aid for nutrition, health, and clean water provision.
这意味着两件事：允许公司立刻扣减所有设备和结构方面的投资，而不是将该成本进行摊销；以及取消新发生债务的利息成本扣减。	This means two things: allowing companies to deduct all investments in equipment and structures immediately, instead of spreading the cost over time; and eliminating the deduction for interest costs on newly incurred debts.
他们将与他共享他们的一致决定：帮助他为他的人民造就一个更美好、更民主的未来，并推动乌克兰融入欧洲-大西洋的整合。	They will share with him their common determination to help him build a better, more democratic future for his people, and strengthen Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration.
2007年3月的决议则呼吁在向伊朗出售重型武器的时候要“审慎和克制 ” ， 并且避免新的赠款、财政援助或者减让性贷款。	The March 2007 resolution called for “vigilance and restraint” in the sale of heavy weapons to Iran and avoidance of new grants, financial assistance, or concessional loans.
去年8月，中国宣布准备允许人民币略有贬值，并计划最终实现人民币更加自由的浮动，这引起了金融市场的“过山车 ” 。	China’s announcement last August of its intent to allow modest depreciation and eventually move the renminbi toward greater exchange-rate flexibility triggered a roller-coaster ride in financial markets.
如今，发展专家大体上都来自新兴和发展中国家 — — 毕竟，这些国家生活在发展中 — — 因此，世界银行行长应该出自这些国家中的一个似乎是理所当然的。	Since expertise on development by and large lies within the emerging and developing countries – after all, they live development – it seems natural that the World Bank’s head would come from one of those countries.
其次，印度正与伊朗合作在阿曼湾建造深海港口查巴哈，目的在于帮助印度绕过其区域竞争对手巴基斯坦去进军阿富汗和中亚。	Second, India has cooperated with Iran to build the Iranian deep-water port of Chabahar on the Gulf of Oman, intended to help India bypass its regional rival, Pakistan, in gaining access to Afghanistan and Central Asia.
英国和欧盟已经处于半脱离状态 — — 它身处申根协议之外，没有参加欧元区，许多内政事务（包括避难政策）也和欧盟不同。	Britain is already semi-detached – outside of Schengen and with opt-outs from the euro and many home-affairs matters (including asylum policy).
从1990年代末到2000年，许多观察家都认为共产党的统治已经是强弩之末，肯定会走上由东欧剧变作为开端的“列宁主义灭亡”之路。	From the late 1980’s until 2000, many observers presented the Party as being on its last legs, certain to succumb to the “Leninist extinction” that began with communism’s collapse in Europe.
"所以其他国家必须学会加入到这场游戏当中来。 支持""多边主义""和国际法则也许不仅仅是道义上正确的事情，它还是美国的盟国及美国自己的利益所在。"	Standing up for multilateralism and international rule of law may not only be the morally right thing to do; it is also in the interests of America's allies and, ultimately, America itself.
协议继续要求初级预算盈余（不含利息支付）到2018年增加至GDP的3.5 % ， 这将恶化希腊衰退。	The agreement continues to require primary budget surpluses (net of interest payments), rising to 3.5% of GDP by 2018, which will worsen Greece’s slump.
奥巴马总统的说法是 ： “ 我们有一个明确鲜明的目标：干扰，瓦解和击退巴基斯坦和阿富汗的基地组织，不能让他们在未来获得政权 。 ”	For his part, Obama said in March that “We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future.”
这些女性经常会假定，只要比周围的人付出多一倍的努力 — — 但坚决不为她们自己的价值或成就辩护 — — 就会带来收入的提高，因为自己的上级会看在眼里的。	They frequently assume that working twice as hard as those around them – while never speaking up for their own worth or accomplishments – will generate a raise because an authority figure will notice.
要避免这样的结果，欧盟必须改革自身，从一个多数统治的再分配联盟转变为一致性统治的最优和自愿的联盟 — — 即符合帕累托原则的联盟。	To avoid such an outcome, the EU must transform itself from a redistributive union ruled by the majority to an optimal and voluntary union ruled by unanimity – one that conforms to the Pareto principle.
印刷机的发明使科技革命成为可能，蒸气机的发明为工业革命创造了条件，而印度摆脱饥荒则主要依靠提高农业产出¾也就是所谓的“绿色革命 ” 。	The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press, the industrial revolution by the steam engine, and India’s escape from famine by increased farm yields – the so-called “Green Revolution.”
本月早些时候，苹果公司CEO库克（Tim Cook）说“中国已不再是多年前哪个低劳动力成本的国家，劳动力成本低廉也不再是来华的原因 。 ”	Earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook declared that, “China stopped being a low-labor-cost country many years ago, and that is not the reason to come to China.”
不过这一同盟以及与中国的关系现在又出现了一个新问题。 今年中国超越美国成为世界上最大的温室气体排放国。	There is a new dimension to the alliance, however, and to the relationship with China. This year, China surpassed the US as the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
犹太人也曾经是开罗、大马士革和巴格达的重要居民，如今他们也从中东各主要穆斯林地区消失了，前往以色列、欧洲和北美定居。	Jews, too – once a vital presence in cities like Cairo, Damascus, and Baghdad – have all but disappeared from the predominantly Muslim parts of the Middle East, relocating to Israel, Europe, and North America.
比如，在美国，新闻组织就业机会在不到十年的时间里减少了近四分之一，而顶级新闻院校的入学人数最近也大幅下降。	In the United States, for example, newsroom employment has dropped nearly one-quarter in less than ten years, while enrollment in top journalism schools has tapered off more recently.
原因在于 ： “ 经济学家，成为了这么一种团体，他们用具有迷惑力的数学来包装自己，给我们一个美丽的错觉，让我们看不清事情的本质 。 ” 同时，他们提供一个“理想化的经济模型，即市场是完美的，每个参与者都是理性的 。 ”	Krugman’s heavy pounding of Chicago School economics goaded Cochrane, a professor of finance, into some bad-tempered counter-punching on the university’s Web site, much of which consisted of a personal attack on Krugman’s scientific integrity.
卢旺达政府最近在全国课程体系中纳入了阿卡兹·卡诺泽计划的方法，让中等学校和TVET学生具备取得成功所需要的软技能。	The government recently integrated Akazi Kanoze’s approach in the national curriculum to equip secondary and TVET students with the soft skills they require to succeed.
尽管全球经济状况萎靡，但摩洛哥的商品仍然行销全球，对法国、美国、巴西、海湾国家和中国的出口十分强劲。	Despite the weak global economy, Morocco sells its goods worldwide, with strong exports to France, the US, Brazil, the Gulf states, and China.
现在适应这样的新情况将赋予国家相当大的竞争优势，因为它增强了女性的自由和权利、创造了就业机会并且提高了社会的平等度。	Adapting to these new circumstances now will give countries a considerable advantage, as it bolsters women’s rights and freedoms, generates jobs, and make societies more equal.
即使将来欧洲还将面对更多的坏消息 — — 比方说希腊问题，或者中国经济放缓的幅度超出预期 — — 欧元区也可能从本月开始走出危机模式。	Even if there is further bad news for Europe – from Greece, for example, or from a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China – the eurozone could begin to move out of crisis mode this month.
这些包括斯堪的那维亚国家、西班牙和日本发生的巨大的危机，以及二十世纪八十年代美国储蓄和贷款危机等较为轻微的事件。	These include epic crises in the Scandinavian countries, Spain, and Japan, along with lesser events such as the US savings and loan crises of the 1980’s.
这一趋势在校园餐领域正在发生逆转，这要归因于立法创新，比如允许优先考虑（不能超过10 % ） 本地产品。	This trend is now being reversed in school food, thanks to legislative innovations such as allowing a preference (of up to about 10%) for locally grown products.
美国在中东的多场战争 — — 阿富汗、伊拉克、叙利亚、利比亚，等等 — — 是为了让苏联以及随后的俄罗斯退出竞争，让美国独树霸权。	The multiple US wars in the Middle East – Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and others – have sought to remove the Soviet Union, and then Russia, from the scene and to give the US hegemonic sway.
西方健康的年轻男性，在他们的成长过程中，在每个街角都能接触到色情和性有关的内容，他们中的性欲减退的状况正愈显普遍。 所以，不难想象，在较保守文化中，仍存在那种性依然所能传承的力量。	Among healthy young men in the West, who grow up on pornography and sexual imagery on every street corner, reduced libido is a growing epidemic, so it is easy to imagine the power that sexuality can still carry in a more modest culture.
让一些民主力量感到失望的是，布托甚至在穆沙拉夫于11月3号宣布实施紧急状态，并罢免了该国的大法官们以确保自己获选连任之后，仍然坚持既定的路线。	To the dismay of some democratic forces, Bhutto stayed the course even after Musharraf imposed emergency rule on November 3 and removed the country’s top judges to ensure his re-election.
克他命（ketamine）是一种麻醉剂，主要用于兽医以及手术和其他痛苦疗程的短期麻醉和止痛。 最近，这种药物正在抑郁症研究中成为冉冉升起的明星。	Ketamine – a drug primarily used as an anesthetic in veterinary medicine and as a short-term anesthetic and analgesic in hospitals during surgery or other painful procedures – is currently the rising star of depression research.
他发现，在正式部门，本地人工作岗位在难民涌入后事实上是增加的，这显然是拜难民流入对地区经济的刺激效应所赐。	He found that in the formal sector, jobs for locals actually increased after the influx of refugees, apparently because of the stimulative effect on the region’s economy.
在一次有趣的最新讲话中，英格兰银行首席经济学家安迪·哈尔丹（Andy Haldane）用调查证据说明了央行想要影响的群众对央行的理解情况。	In an intriguing recent speech, Andy Haldane, the BoE’s chief economist, marshals survey evidence on how well central banks are understood by the populations they are trying to influence.
但大不列颠精英们彻底认清了自己国家的衰落，于是异常重视与美国的“特殊关系 ” ， 因为这是让英国感觉自己不同于法国，依然隶属于大国行列的唯一方式。	But the British elite, fully aware of their country’s decline, took the “special relationship” with the US very seriously, for it was the only way for Britain to feel like it was still a major power, unlike, say, France.
在我们这个观点、新闻和信息以光速传播的相互联系的世界里，幸福是一种竞争优势；事实上，它是企业品牌的核心内容。	In our connected and social world, where opinion, news, and information travel at the speed of light, happiness is a competitive advantage; indeed, it is central to a company’s brand.
2000年至2004年之间，美国的每小时劳动生产率每年增长2.8 ％ ， 欧元区经济体略高于1 ％ 。 美国的速度要比欧元区快大于两倍。	Between 2000 and 2004, hourly labor productivity rose more than twice as fast in the US than in the large euro zone economies – 2.8% per year versus little more than 1%.
在犹太-基督教-伊斯兰传统理论中，人性充满着原罪，但可以通过侍奉上帝来得到救赎，而上帝正是依据他自己的形象创造了我们人类。	In the Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions, human nature is fundamentally corrupted by sin, but can be redeemed by embracing God, in whose image we have been created.
股东积极主义者大卫·埃因霍恩（David Einhorn）出场了。 他的对冲基金 — — 绿光资本（Greenlight Capital）一直施压苹果公司派发合适比例的现金。	Enter shareholder activist David Einhorn, whose hedge fund Greenlight Capital has been pressing Apple to distribute a healthy fraction of that cash.
在几乎每个转折点上，而且几乎涉及所有重大问题，国家政府都未能拿出有效决策，而城市领袖却继续鼓舞着公众的信心。	At nearly every turn, on just about every major issue, national governments are failing to deliver solutions, while city leaders continue to inspire public confidence.
值得肯定的是，绝大多数非洲国家已经认识到要想解决它们目前所面临的一系列相互关联的挑战，就必须进行这样的转型。	And, to their credit, most African countries already recognize that such a transformation is necessary to address a wide range of interconnected challenges that they are now confronting.
然而，这一数字仅说明了很小的一部分问题，因为全球80%的劳动力都在非正式的部门就业，这些人没有任何失业保障或者其他的社会福利。	That number captures only a fraction of the problem, since 80% of the global workforce is in the informal sector, without any unemployment benefits or other social protection.
大体上，弗里德曼和施瓦茨被视为在指责美联储没能迅速地对接二连三的银行倒闭潮 — — 第一波在1930年末，接着在1931和1933年两度再次发生 — — 做出反应。	Friedman and Schwartz are generally seen as reproving the Fed for failing to react swiftly to successive waves of bank failures, first in late 1930 and then again in 1931 and 1933.
他们说专家未能预见到2008年金融危机、一贯在政策建议中奉行效率第一的原则、并且盲目假设因其施政方略而受损的民众能够以某种不确定的方式得到补偿。	They say that the experts failed to foresee the financial crisis of 2008, put efficiency first in their policy advice, and blindly assumed that the losers from their policy prescriptions could be compensated in some unspecified way.
在美国，存在不提高税率而增加收入的空间，即限制所谓的税收开支（tax expenditures ） — —写入税收规则而不由国会每年划拨的支出形式。	In the US, there is scope to raise revenue without increasing tax rates, by limiting so-called tax expenditures – the forms of spending that are built into the tax rules rather than appropriated annually by Congress.
发达工业化国家在发展的早期阶段享受了快速经济增长和社会福利提高的好处，一大原因就是知识产权保护较弱，不及现在的发展中国家所面临的要求高。	Advanced industrialized countries in earlier stages of their development benefited from faster economic growth and greater social welfare by explicitly adopting weaker IP protection than is demanded of developing countries today.
但从历史及国际经验来看，构建强健而持续的反腐机制绝非易事，因为腐败官员往往会竭尽全力去影响、甚至操纵这些机构。	But building robust and lasting anti-graft institutions will not be easy, owing to the enduring ability of corrupt officials to capture such institutions.
特朗普会说，任何对美国人的风险都是不可接受的，不管有多少阿兰·库尔迪因此丧命，又有多少人生活因此受到干扰。	Trump may argue that any risk to an American is unacceptable, regardless of how many Aylan Kurdis die and how many lives are disrupted.
阿富汗国家安全顾问兰金·达德法尔·斯潘塔称协议“为阿富汗安全奠定了坚实的基础，是地区发展的指导性纲领 。 ”	Afghanistan’s national security adviser, Rangin Dadfar Spanta, describes the pact as “providing a strong foundation for the security of Afghanistan, (and) a document for the development of the region.”
他们的受教育程度不断提高，也更清楚公司如何运作。 当他们认为企业行为越界时，他们会比过去更加坦率和积极主动。	They are becoming more educated and aware of how companies operate, and they are more proactive and outspoken when they believe a company has crossed the line.
但空气质量最糟糕的时候是冬季，污染的空气碰上了冬季大雾，被锁定在德里，整座城市都陷入了一篇灰蒙蒙，可见度下降，航班延误，交通堵塞 — — 交通堵塞让汽车进入了污染更重的怠速模式。	But the worst air quality is in winter, when polluted air meets winter fog and is trapped, giving Delhi a grayish opacity that reduces visibility, delays flights, and reduces the city’s traffic to an even more polluting crawl.
国际食物政策研究所（International Food Policy Research Institute）的刁新生（Xinshen Diao）指出，这一增长受不可贸易的服务部门的拉动，特别是建筑业、运输业和餐饮饭店业。	Xinshen Diao of the International Food Policy Research Institute has shown that this growth was led by non-tradable services, in particular construction, transport, and hotels and restaurants.
第二个美联储主席潜在候选人是杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell ） ， 他已经在美联储理事会任职五年。	The second potential candidate for Fed Chair is Jerome Powell, who has been on the Fed Board for five years.
中国在货币升值方面迈出了细小的第一步，无论最终会产生什么样的经济影响，都让人对其卓越的谋略感到佩服。	Whatever the ultimate economic effects of China’s first modest step towards floating its currency, one has to admire its strategic brilliance.
在博取西方领导人信任并眼看苏联在东欧的帝国解体之后，他在1990年辞职，声称俄罗斯在戈尔巴乔夫领导下已重新回到独裁政府。	Having gained the trust of Western leaders and overseen the dismantling of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe, he then resigned in 1990, declaring that Russia – under Gorbachev – was returning to dictatorship.
此外，依温特所言，如果他的团队的新技术能在明年面世的话，那就有可能制造出一种可以在24小时内生效的H1N1流感疫苗，再也不用等待几个月才能实现免疫。	And, according to Venter, if his team’s new technology had been available last year, it would have been possible to produce a vaccine to protect ourselves against H1N1 influenza in 24 hours, rather than several weeks.
例如，2006年，津巴布韦的债务将下降几乎相当于国民生产总值的10 ％ ， 而将更多的资源用于发展。	In 2006, for example, Zambia will see its debt fall by almost 10% of GDP, leaving more resources available for development.
但斯密-李嘉图理论存在一个关键的局限性：它不会对一个国家的公民进行分类，因此也无法解答一个国家内部的收入分配问题。	But the Smith-Ricardo theory has a key limitation: it does not distinguish among a country’s citizens, and therefore cannot address the question of income distribution within a country.
自2010年重夺总理之位后，欧尔班牵着这个国家走上了专制民族主义道路，他还利用难民危机进一步巩固了民众的“围城心态”并以此维持支持率。	Since his return to the premiership in 2010, Orbán has committed Hungary to an authoritarian nationalist path, and he has exploited the refugee crisis to cement a “siege mentality” that helps him sustain popular support.
面对如此显而易见的恢复力，在近几年中将全球增长描述为“新平庸 ” （ new mediocre）的国际货币基金组织（IMF ） ， 最近修正了其世界经济展望。	In response to this apparent resilience, the International Monetary Fund, which in recent years had characterized global growth as the “new mediocre,” recently upgraded its World Economic Outlook.
在日本的民族主义团体中，这种叙事就变成了对战时盟友所采用的历史版本的沮丧感；都过去70多年了 — — 加上数十亿美元的赔偿和外国援助，日本也该甩开这些包袱了。	Among Japanese nationalist groups, the narrative is one of frustration with the wartime Allies’ version of history; almost 70 years – and billions of dollars in reparations and foreign assistance – later, Japan would like to move on.
但鲁哈尼没有就叙利亚问题发表决定性声明，即使在一系列漏出照片证明了叙利亚存在系统性虐待和屠杀并且引起了国际社会的公愤的情况下伊朗仍不表态，这对伊朗的处境非常不利。	But Rouhani’s failure to make a decisive statement on Syria – even after a series of leaked photographs of systematic torture and massacre raised the ire of the international community – has not helped the case for keeping Iran in the fold.
但美国也有意识地淡化这一管理手段，不与台湾进行最高级别的互动，这样做的意思是破除台湾果真宣布独立还能获得美国支持的幻想。	But the US deliberately attenuates this message by refusing to engage with Taiwan at the highest levels, which is meant to disabuse Taiwan of the notion that it can count on American support if the island ever actually declares independence.
这两点也是即将到来的世界经济论坛达沃斯-克洛斯特斯（Davos-Klosters）年会上的组织原则。 此次年会将以“全球化4.0：构建第四次工业革命时代的新构架”为主题。	These will be the two organizing principles of the World Economic Forum’s upcoming Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters, which will convene under the theme of “Globalization 4.0: Shaping a New Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution”.
今天，世界充满了动态的复杂性，基于科学、快速变迁的全球经济使得如此之多的现象互相交错，以至于我们无法通过根据过去的线性外推来预测未来。	Today’s dynamic complexity, in which a science-based, fast-changing global economy makes so many more phenomena interdependent, prevents us from foreseeing the future through linear extrapolations of the past.
发自新德里 — — 不知西方在干涉利比亚过程中的所产生“使命偏离效应 ” （ mission creep，意指行动偏离原定目标）是否会无意中在欧洲的南大门外孕育出一个伊斯兰圣战大本营呢？	NEW DELHI – Will “mission creep” in the West’s intervention in Libya end up creating, inadvertently, a jihadist citadel at Europe’s southern doorstep?
比如，美国拒绝在印度东北部的阿鲁纳恰尔邦（中国自2006年以来称之为“藏南 ” ） 采取联合军事行动。	For example, the US has declined to hold joint military exercises in the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China has claimed as “South Tibet” since 2006.
幸运的是，中国城市规划者还有很大的空间放松土地供给和容积率（楼面总面积与建筑用地面积之比）方面的限制。	Fortunately, there is scope for China’s urban planners to relax restrictions on the supply of land and on the floor area ratio (the ratio of gross floor area to the size of the lot on which the building stands).
爱尔兰提供的洞见有助于理解社会政治系统（包括经济遭受重创的塞浦路斯和希腊等国家）是如何应对几年前无法想象的冲击的。	Ireland provides insights that are helpful in understanding how sociopolitical systems, including economically devastated countries like Cyprus and Greece, have coped so far with shocks that were essentially unthinkable just a few years ago.
如今，微软公司全世界员工总数只有100,000人，谷歌是50,000人，Facebook只有5,000人。	Today, Microsoft employs only 100,000 people worldwide, Google employs 50,000, and Facebook employs just 5,000.
香港— 诸多最新评论警告中国债务激增，从2008年占GDP的148%增加到2015年三季度末的249 % 。	HONG KONG – A spate of recent commentary has been warning of the vertiginous rise in China’s debt, which jumped from 148% of GDP in 2007 to 249% at the end of the third quarter of 2015.
在近期的减税政策之下，美国预算赤字可能在未来十年内扩大到至少1兆美元，而对国内储蓄的压力只会有增无减。	With US budget deficits likely to widen by at least $1 trillion over the next ten years, owing to the recent tax cuts, pressures on domestic saving will only intensify.
谷歌和脸书这类“信息垄断者”面临的监管障碍很少，也因此为消费者创造了前所未有的价值 — — 同时让企业自身获取了巨大的市场支配力。	The “info-monopolists” Google and Facebook, faced with few regulatory obstacles, have created unprecedented value for consumers – and have secured massive market power for themselves.
所有美国金融机构必须按规矩行事，还要还清所有债务，此外，正如伦敦长期以来一直在做的那样，必须维持市场的信心，这就意味着必须保证美元能和黄金自由兑换。	America’s financial house had to be put in order, all debts repaid, and, as London had done for a long time, confidence had to be maintained, which meant guaranteeing the dollar’s convertibility into gold.
最近，中国的增长很大程度上依靠债务融资的投资 — — 通常是基础设施和住房等项目，旨在支持中国梦 — — 因此任何控制信用增长的努力都有可能导致硬着陆。	Given that China owes much of its recent growth to debt-financed investment – often in projects like infrastructure and housing, meant to support the Chinese Dream – any effort to get credit growth under control is likely to cause a hard landing.
如果回顾一下15年前这个月发生的那次震撼欧洲和世界的革命，我们应该为取得的成绩感到骄傲－我们得到了自由、民主，跨越了长达40年的欧洲分裂。	Looking back to the revolutions that shook Europe and the world 15 years ago this month, we should rejoice in what has been gained - freedom, democracy, and transcendence of Europe's 40-year division.
这不是滥用某个工具（当利益集团游说要求加入外部竞争保护条款时，这种情况经常发生 ） ； 相反，这属于完全按照预想方式使用工具。	This would not be a case of misusing a tool (a frequent occurrence in trade policy when interest groups lobby for protection against foreign competition); rather, it would be a case of using the tool in precisely the intended way.
事实上，它已经制定了一个详细战略将家庭天然气消费降低一大半，计划拆分腐败的天然气垄断商国家天然气公司并摆脱对俄罗斯的能源依赖。	Indeed, it has already created a detailed strategy to cut household gas consumption by more than half, with the goal of dispersing the corrupt gas monopoly of Naftogaz and ending Ukraine’s energy dependence on Russia.
1747年奈迪尔沙驾崩，钻石落到了其部将、阿富汗埃米尔艾哈迈德沙杜兰尼（Ahmad Shah Durrani）手中。	Upon Nadir Shah’s death in 1747, the diamond fell into the hands of one of his generals, Ahmad Shah Durrani, who became the Emir of Afghanistan.
提供普遍的互联网接入是一项规模堪与人类基因组测序相媲美的工程；此外，与人类基因组工程类似，它将带来新的风险和伦理问题。	Providing universal Internet access is a project on a scale similar to sequencing the human genome, and, like the human-genome project, it will raise new risks and sensitive ethical issues.
南斯拉夫 — — 威尔逊主义外交政策的拙劣产物 — — 所发生的事情可能中东更加互相怀疑的诸帝国间重演。	What happened in Yugoslavia, an ill-conceived product of Wilsonian diplomacy, could happen in the more cynical imperial creations in the Middle East.
相比之下，拥有大学学历者，40岁以下选民和从事“A、B类”职业的专业人士阶层则有60%至40%以上选择“留下 ” 。	By contrast, university graduates, voters under 40, and members of the “A, B” professional classes plan to vote “Remain” by similar margins of 60% to 40% and higher.
对于像苏格兰这样的新成立的主权国家，市场免不了会要求利率溢价，通过发行英镑债券能够让这一溢价最小化，从而保护投资者免遭贬值风险。	The interest-rate premium that the market would inevitably demand from a young sovereign like Scotland could be minimized by issuing debt in sterling, thereby protecting investors from additional devaluation risk.
打破欧盟委员会和欧盟理事会的官僚主义管理并将国内研究资金向欧盟领域内的竞争开放，将使研究费用得到更有效的利用。	Research spending should be made more effective by scrapping bureaucratic management by the Commission and Council and opening all national research funds to EU-wide competition.
对于世界银行而言，它并不需要自我“重新定位”才像一般意义上的发展援助产业那样将自身扎根于新兴国家之中。	As for the World Bank, it does not need to “reposition” itself so much as to root itself in emerging countries, as does the development aid industry in general.
有了这样的工资补贴，竞争性力量将会让雇主们雇佣更多的工人，而随之而来的失业率降低将会让大多数补贴以直接或间接的劳动力补偿形式支付。	With such wage subsidies, competitive forces would cause employers to hire more workers, and the resulting fall in unemployment would cause most of the subsidy to be paid out as direct or indirect labor compensation.
欧洲抵御俄罗斯地缘政治优势的能力的关键在于制定一个统一的能源政策，有一个欧洲范围的分配网络和能够凌驾于各国监管者之上的欧洲范围的监管机构。	The key to Europe’s ability to neutralize Russia’s geopolitical advantage is to establish a unified energy policy, with a Europe-wide distribution network and a Europe-wide regulatory authority that has precedence over national regulators.
但是按照报告中的说法，穆巴拉克、他的夫人苏珊、以及他的两个儿子贾迈勒和阿莱，远远没有袖手旁观那么简单。	According to the report, however, Mubarak; his wife, Susan; and his two sons, Gamal and Alaa, are far from being mere bystanders.
也许有人会反对说实施内部的重新安置无异于在迎合“种族或宗教清洗 ” 。 但是伊拉克长期战争的代价无疑会不管如何都会导致它的分割，是比这更糟糕的结果。	One may object that to facilitate internal relocation is to collaborate with “ethnic or religious cleansing”; but the toll of prolonged war in Iraq, which could lead to its dismemberment anyway, is much worse.
在中国、巴西、马来西亚和墨西哥，国外直接投资（FDI）占到了固定资产构成总额的8%到12%¾而且不增加任何债务负担。	In China, Brazil, Malaysia, and Mexico, foreign direct investment (FDI) accounts for 8% to 12% of gross fixed capital formation – without generating debt.
巴基斯坦的社会和军队精英集团必须达成广泛共识 — — 或许还要借助国外援助，但绝不需要外国干预 — — 确定总理、总统和军队各自的合宪角色。	Pakistan’s civil and military elite must create a broad consensus – perhaps with foreign assistance, but never with foreign meddling – on the constitutional roles of the prime minister, president, and the military.
争论国家应该大些还是小些既冗长又毫无意义，还不如问问什么类型的国家干预、在哪些地方进行干预更有效实在。	Instead of the sterile and endless debate as to whether the state should be big or small, it is more fruitful to ask what kind of state intervention, and where.
世界经济论坛的研究估算，一旦联合起来，每年在气候变化方面只要新增360亿美元的公共部门投资，就能撬动16倍的资金，动员5700亿美元的私人资本。	A World Economic Forum study estimates that, when aligned, an annual increase of only $36 billion in public-sector investment in climate change could be leveraged to 16 times that amount by mobilizing $570 billion of private capital.
例如，2013年上半年，马来西亚政府的广告开支比排名第二到第五位的四家广告企业的总和还多美元1.18亿。	During the first half of 2013, for example, Malaysia’s government spent $118.5 million more on ads than the next four advertisers combined.
但是最近的一些事件却宣告了欧洲一体化 — — 即建立一个会成为超级强权的全新联邦国家的“前所未有的紧密联盟”的说法的终结。	But recent events do spell the end of one version of European integration – the vision of an “ever closer union” producing a federal country that would become a new superpower.
获得的收入可以支持脆弱国发展应对气候变化的长期计划，并为旨在最小化损失和伤害、共享信息和模仿最佳实践的实验项目提供融资。	The revenues could support vulnerable countries’ efforts to develop long term plans to deal with climate change, as well as finance pilot projects aimed at minimizing loss and damage, sharing information, and replicating best practices.
事实上，经济改革为个人创造力和企业家精神营造了空间，带来了前所未有的快速增长时期，将数亿中国人民带出贫困。	Indeed, by creating space for individual creativity and entrepreneurship, they unleashed a historically unprecedented period of rapid growth that lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty.
查韦斯死后进行的最新选举大致也是如此 — — 此外还有大规模的计票伎俩，查韦斯的指定接班人马杜罗顺利当选。	Much the same – along with accusations of widespread vote-counting irregularities – could be said about the recent election held after Chávez died, which installed his handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro.
但人们对流氓科学家会利用运动员、或运动员会参加基因转移试验，以便获得无法预知的成绩提高的忧心与恐惧都是切实存在的。	But the fear that rogue scientists will take advantage of athletes – or that athletes will seek to enroll in gene-transfer experiments in an attempt to receive some undetectable performance benefit – is very real.
特里芬在50多年前就提出了这一警告，但直到最近才获得重视，中国的崛起让世界越来越不愿意忍受美元计价体系带来的不稳定性。	Triffin issued his warning more than 50 years ago, but it has recently gained traction, as China’s rise has made the world increasingly disinclined to tolerate the instability caused by a dollar-denominated system.
他们是在加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛的泛阿拉伯民族主义教育下长大的。 对他们来说，最重要的政治事件是1967年阿以战争中阿拉伯的失利。	They were weaned on Gamal Abdel-Nasser’s pan-Arab nationalism, and the crucial political event for them was the Arab defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
直到不久前，在教育及部分传媒界仍然存在着一股强大的左翼力量，利用日本可怕的战争纪录反对任何形式的修宪企图。	Until not long ago, there was a strong left-wing current in education and some of the media that used Japan’s horrendous wartime record as an argument against any kind of revisionism.
"而布什政府强调 ： "" 美国眼中的韩国是强大稳定的联盟，我们会全力维护韩国的安全，维护与汉城的盟友和伙伴关系 。 """	"Yet the Bush administration insists: ""The US views South Korea as a strong and steadfast ally. We are committed to South Korea's security and to our alliance and partnership with Seoul."""
有鉴于此，也许真正的问题在于，当其他新兴市场国家纷纷以某种形式采取了资本账户管制时，土耳其为何不这么做。	Given this, perhaps the real question is why Turkey refrained from using capital-account regulations, when almost all of its emerging-market counterparts were using them in some form.
伯克利 — — 清迈倡议（CMI）是2000年在泰国城市清迈建立的亚洲金融互助机制，它的终极目标从来就不是一个问题。	BERKELEY – There has never been a question about the ultimate purpose of the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI), the system of Asian financial supports created in 2000 in that Thai city.
四年来，我一直指出，我们的商业周期问题需要更积极的货币和财政扩张政策，只有采取这样的政策，我们最大的问题才能较快地解决。	I have been arguing for four years that our business-cycle problems call for more aggressively expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and that our biggest problems would quickly melt away were such policies to be adopted.
第二轮竞赛在1987年开始退潮，当时里根和戈尔巴乔夫同意签署销毁中程导弹的条约，苏联解体后，第二轮空间竞赛也结束了。	The second wave of competition ebbed in 1987, when Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to a treaty eliminating intermediate-range missiles, and ended when the Soviet Union dissolved.
不消说，西非地区有很多人感觉到我们就像是实验室中的老鼠，被用在了一场可能摧毁非洲农户养活自己和社区的能力的实验中。	Needless to say, many of us in the region feel as though we are being used as lab rats in an experiment that could devastate African farming families’ capacity to feed themselves and their communities.
格林斯潘使用超宽松货币政策清理2000年互联网泡沫破裂后的乱局，同时坚持美联储不应该因为对20世纪90年代末投机疯狂无动于衷而受到谴责。 他的这一观点受到广泛赞誉。	Greenspan took credit for using super-easy monetary policy to clean up the mess after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, while insisting that the Fed should feel vindicated for not leaning against the speculative madness of the late 1990s.
在洪灾顶峰，印度政府从国家灾难响应基金（National Disaster Response Fund）中拨款进行紧急救援。	At the peak of the floods, the Indian government allocated money from the National Disaster Response Fund for immediate relief.
与诺德豪斯证明2.5℃的温度限额几乎不可能实现的谨慎研究相反，有人正在不断煽动将全球温度上升保持在困难得多的1.5℃阈值以下的热情。	Contrast Nordhaus’s careful work showing that a 2.5°C cap is near impossible, with the excitement being whipped up about keeping the rise in global temperature below the much harder 1.5°C threshold.
第二个差异是意大利的劳动市场改革和市场解除管制措施依然停留在其总理马泰奥·伦奇（Matteo Renzi）新组建政府的议程上。	The second difference is that labor-market reform and market liberalization in Italy remain on the to-do list for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s new government.
和平谈判的第二个关键前提是，作为民主国家，以色列不会想通过军事占领永远统治另一个民族 — — 这等于剥夺了巴勒斯坦人自治（self-determination）这一基本人权。	The second key assumption underlying peace negotiations was that Israel, as a democratic country, would not want to rule another people through military occupation – thereby denying them their basic human right of self-determination – in perpetuity.
这主要是由于共产主义结束迫使其经济瘫痪而使俄国遭受屈辱，以及西方对于俄国的基本力量和韧性没有长远眼光。	This owes much to the humiliations that Russia suffered when the end of communism forced its economy to its knees, and to Western short-sightedness about Russia’s fundamental strengths and resilience.
事实上，GDP增长放缓或许恰恰因为当前基本由地方政府和国有企业主导的制造业和基础设施投资并不符合国内实际需求。	In fact, GDP growth may be slowing precisely because existing investment in manufacturing and infrastructure, undertaken largely by local governments and SOEs, does not match the pattern of domestic demand.
尽管不是所有阿富汗塔利班都对谈判持开放态度，但他相信会有足够多的塔利班参与谈判，得到招安，从而削弱最极端的派系。	Though not all Afghan Taliban would be open to talks, he believed that enough of them could be engaged and pacified to weaken the most extreme factions.
支持者中包括亲库尔德人的人民民主党（People’s Democratic Party，HDP ） ， 该党83%的成员支持示威。	Supporters included members of the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP), 83% of whom approved of the protest.
我们不必“白手起家 ” ， 而是需要以国家层面的竞争当局的行业知识为基础，并在此过程中将有经验的人手纳入进来。	Rather than starting from scratch, we will need to build on national-level competition authorities’ institutional knowledge, and include experienced personnel in the process.
尽管证据表明，削减医疗补助计划的联邦最近投入的方案不会影响失去该计划覆盖的人的身体健康，但联邦资金削减将迫使州增加免费看护计划的支出。	Although the evidence indicates that the proposed cutbacks in federal dollars for Medicaid would not harm the physical health of those who lost their coverage, the reduction would force states to increase spending on their free-care programs.
目前，七人的理事会已经出现两个空缺 — — 很快还会有更多空缺出现（主席和副主席任期都将在明年初到期 ） 。	There are currently two vacancies on the seven-member board – and more positions may open up soon (the terms of both the chair and vice chair expire early next year).
我们西方可能急需俄罗斯的能源，但如果俄罗斯不想在未来蜕变为东方式的专制，它就必须满怀诚意与西方接触。	We in the West may badly need Russia’s energy, but if Russia does not want its future to degenerate into Oriental despotism, it must engage with the West in good faith.
如今，这个原本稳定的地区的其他国家也卷入了这场危机；事实上，随着罗兴亚人入境寻求庇护，孟加拉国、泰国和印尼等国家日益感受到溢出效应。	Now, other countries in an otherwise stable region are becoming embroiled in the crisis; indeed, countries such as Bangladesh, Thailand, and Indonesia are increasingly feeling the spillover effects, as Rohingya seek asylum within their borders.
作为所谓的的第五代领导人，他们有能力继续沿着邓小平在20世纪70年代末定下，并在随后诸代中国领导人间实行不悖的交接程序走下去。	As so-called Fifth Generation leaders, they continue the steady progress in competence that has marked each of China’s leadership transitions since the emergence of Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970’s.
但虽然俄国信息战在破坏方面的确取得了某种程度的成功并在某种程度上影响了2016年美国大选，但却未能创造出软实力。	But while Russian information warfare has been somewhat successful in terms of disruption, affecting the 2016 US election somewhat, it has failed in terms of generating soft power.
施密特反复表达对宏伟计划和长期愿景的深刻怀疑一再凸显了他实用主义者的形象，尽管他从未放弃过自己的基本信念，即认定自己的政治目标无不拥有道德根基。	Schmidt reinforced his image as a pragmatist by consistently voicing his deep skepticism of grand designs and long-term visions, albeit without ever renouncing his fundamental belief that there was a moral basis for his political objectives.
全球崩溃的风险很小，因为大部分发达经济体都在迅速去杠杆化；财政拖累的影响较小；货币政策仍然有利；资产再通胀也造成了积极的财富效应。	The risk of a global crash has been low, because deleveraging has proceeded apace in most advanced economies; the effects of fiscal drag are smaller; monetary policies remain accommodative; and asset reflation has had positive wealth effects.
那些没有恢复选拔程序的大学，如布宜诺斯艾利斯大学，发现他们打造学术、商业和政治精英的能力被严重侵蚀。	Those that did not, such as the University of Buenos Aires, saw their role in shaping their countries’ academic, business, and political elites diminish.
只要石油赚得的收入源源不断，多数俄国人就不会对叶利钦时代曾一闪而过的民主机遇抱有任何的留恋，因为随之而来的还有混乱、腐败、国际地位衰弱以及无法国家尊严的缺失。	As long as the oil money keeps flowing, most Russians will express no nostalgia for the democratic opening of the Yeltsin years, with its accompanying combination of chaos, corruption, international weakness, and disrespect for the state.
企业、投资者和决策者对于近零利率时代的结束、2004—2008年货币紧缩周期结束以来的首次升息应该抱以多大的担忧？	How worried should businesses, investors, and policymakers around the world be about the end of near-zero interest rates and the start of the first monetary-tightening cycle since 2004-2008?
这场绑架风波从头到尾都主宰了美国媒体，造成了一种创伤后应激障碍，一如一代人之后的9/11恐怖袭击所造成的社会创伤。	The hostage drama dominated the US media from start to finish, resulting in a kind of public post-traumatic stress disorder similar to the social trauma of the 9/11 attacks a generation later.
当然，沙特阿拉伯和伊朗 — — 还有土耳其，它刚刚加入到争夺地区影响力的竞争中 — — 都不想要直接冲突。	Of course, neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran – or Turkey, which has also joined the competition for regional influence – is seeking a direct confrontation.
大西洋两岸的商业领袖相信，成功的TTIP协议将带来巨大的经济收益 — — 许多研究都强化了这一感觉。	Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are convinced that a successful TTIP agreement would bring substantial economic benefits – a perception that many studies reinforce.
他建立了3,500家医疗中心和16,000家医疗站，通过建立更多医学院校和部署38,000多名社区卫生推广工作者极大地扩充了医护工作人员数量。	He created 3,500 health centers and 16,000 health posts, and dramatically expanded the health-care workforce by building more medical schools and deploying more 38,000 community-based health extension workers.
但这一计划适得其反，示威更加严重了，其他部门的工人也要求获得同样的好处，并抗议政府的这一行为所导致的通货膨胀。	But the plan backfired; protests intensified, with other workers demonstrating for similar benefits and railing against the inflation that the move engendered.
只要是由人来做界面的工作 — — 比如GPS和汽车之间、不同语言的文档之间、食材和菜肴之间，或症候和对应疾病之间 — — 现在都有危险。	Any job in which people serve as an interface – between, say, a GPS and a car, documents in different languages, ingredients and a finished dish, or symptoms and a corresponding disease – is now at risk.
这一措施也是出于政治考虑：向银行注入新股本应是更加有效之法，但奥巴马担忧此举会招致国有化和社会主义化的谴责。	This, too, was guided by political considerations: it would have been more efficient to inject new equity into the banks, but Obama feared accusations of nationalization and socialism.
现在，世界突然对缅甸产生了疑问，在60年的军事独裁之后，缅甸真的将开始走向终结该国贱民地位的实质性政治转型了吗？	Now the world is suddenly asking whether Burma (Myanmar), after six decades of military dictatorship, has embarked on a genuine political transition that could end the country’s pariah status.
政客和政策制定者们都在追求更庞大但其现实紧缩适用条件更加窄的救助方案，却不愿去大范围重整葡萄牙、爱尔兰和希腊（欧猪三国）显然不可持续的债务负担 ， 。 ”	Instead of restructuring the manifestly unsustainable debt burdens of Portugal, Ireland, and Greece (the PIGs), politicians and policymakers are pushing for ever-larger bailout packages with ever-less realistic austerity conditions.”
无论如何，这场未遂政变已经完全证实了埃尔多安的被夺权妄想症状，也有助于解释为何针对葛兰主义者和其他政府反对派的打击力度会如此无情和广泛。	In any case, the coup attempt has fully validated Erdoğan’s paranoia, which helps explain why the crackdown on Gülenists and other government opponents has been so ruthless and extensive.
但虽然这些立法干预措施都针对数字平台，但它们却往往没有考虑到今天的虚假信息和政治宣传至少在哪六个方面与之前有所不同。	But while these legislative interventions all target digital platforms, they often fail to account for at least six ways in which today’s disinformation and propaganda differ from yesterday’s.
为了保卫银行体系，美联储将利率维持在人为的低水平；而最新的披露表明，它还向银行提供了1.2万亿美元的秘密贷款。	In order to rescue the banking system, the Federal Reserve, for example, put interest rates at artificially low levels; as was disclosed recently, it also has provided secret loans of $1.2 trillion to banks.
目前的实力平衡是，埃及仍然是地区最有影响力的行动方之一，其政治和经济转型的成与败影响着其他阿拉伯国家的发展。	As that balance currently stands, Egypt continues to be one of the region’s most influential actors, with the success or failure of its political and economic transition affecting how other Arab countries develop.
凯恩斯相信应该执行激进的经济政策来对经济波动现象作出逆周期回应 — — 即在经济衰退期实施扩张政策，回升时实施紧缩政策。	Keynes is associated with a belief in activist economic policy aimed at ensuring counter-cyclical responses to economic fluctuations – expansionary policies during recessions and policy tightening during upswings.
摩洛哥能源供给97%左右需要进口，自身也不拥有石油或天然气储量，其政府将开发可再生能源视为确保摩洛哥经济持续发展的唯一道路。	Given that Morocco imports around 97% of its energy supply, and possesses no oil or natural gas deposits of its own, the government has viewed developing renewable energy as the only way to ensure the country’s continuing economic development.
目前，出口补贴以及援助款项只占欧洲农业预算的1%不到，而且欧盟已经开始在得到其他主要食品出口国家对等许诺的时候消除它们。	At present, export subsidies and support payments represent less than 1% of the European agricultural budget, and the EU has undertaken to eliminate them once it receives reciprocal undertakings from major food-exporting countries.
希特勒对希特勒青年的描述简洁概括了男子汉的理想 ： “ 像赛狗一样快、像皮革一样韧，像克虏伯钢铁一样坚强 。 ”	Hitler’s description of the Hitler Youth put the manly ideal succinctly: “Fast as greyhounds, tough as leather, and hard as Krupp steel.”
这个故事的另一面说起来让人感到很为难：上升的温度将会减少寒冷天气的天数，而后者是一个比炎热大得多的杀手。	There’s another side of the story that’s inconvenient to mention: rising temperatures will reduce the number of cold spells, which are a much bigger killer than heat.
最可靠的数据表明，他成功地减少了不平等性；在他执政期间，委内瑞拉的基尼系数（衡量收入不平等性的百分制指标）从50下降至39，是拉丁美洲国家中下降幅度最大的。	The most reliable data suggest that he was successful at reducing inequality; during his rule, Venezuela’s Gini coefficient, a 100-point scale measuring income inequality, fell from 50 to 39, the biggest decline in Latin America.
出于这个原因，有必要问一问，像德国这样的大国 — — 甚或像加州或得州这样的大州 — — 增加还是减少了全球总需求。	For this reason, it is relevant to ask whether a country as large as Germany – or even a large state like California or Texas – augments or depletes global aggregate demand.
考虑到在执行能力，腐败以及质量控制等方面仍存在疑问，以及美国承诺在未来5年给予每年15亿美元的援助，可以预见，欧盟立场的任何改变都不会产生太大的影响。	Questions of capacity, corruption, and quality assurance remain unanswered, and with the US granting $1.5 billion a year for five years, any change in the EU stance would be relatively insignificant.
但也有充分的理由保持乐观，最重要的是新任沙特领导层已经认识到这一挑战，同时也对应对挑战所能带来的机遇了然于胸。	But there are also good reasons for optimism, most notably the new Saudi leadership’s recognition of the challenge and the possibilities that addressing them could create.
但无论动机为何，这看起来像一种扭曲美国政治进程的行动 — — 也正是在人们未来想要遏制的那种非致命性政治威胁。	Whatever the motive, it looked like an effort to skew the US political process – precisely the type of nonlethal political threat that one would want to deter in the future.
不幸的是，众议院共和党根本不想面对（关于银行的）社会科学的发现 — — 对科学（比如气候变化）的发现显然也是如此。	Unfortunately, the House Republicans simply do not want to be confronted with the findings of social science (on banking) – or apparently of science (for example, on climate change).
20年来，我一直是错的：尽管有高比例的公民被排除在相当部分的重要经济生活之外，西欧的政治仍然保持了稳定。	For 20 years, I have been wrong: West European polities have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens from meaningful participation in much of economic life.
特朗普承诺再次减税被普遍视为共和党国会领导人 — — 最重要的是，该党最大的捐助者 — — 在2016年总统大选中支持他的主要原因，而且他们仍在这样做。	Trump’s promise to cut taxes again is widely viewed as a major reason why Republican congressional leaders – and, most important, the party’s big donors – supported him in 2016 and continued to do so.
此外，随着恐怖分子在组织内部地位的提升，或者从一个恐怖群体转到另一个恐怖群体，其中所涉及的风险、酬劳和必须遵守的制度也千差万别。	Moreover, there are vast differences in terms of risks, rewards, and imperatives as one moves up the organizational chain, or jumps from cell to cell.
而设立这一否决权的本意并非如此，它原本是一种促进合作的手段，从而使得五个常任理事国得以履行其帮助维护全球和平与安全的责任。	But the veto power was intended as a means to facilitate cooperation, thereby enabling the P5 to fulfill their responsibility to help maintain global peace and security.
两个星期前，奥巴马面临着是去参加东盟的会议还是出席柏林墙倒塌20周年纪念的选择，但他最终选择去了亚洲。	Two weeks ago, when Obama had to choose between a meeting of ASEAN or the celebrations in Berlin marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall, he chose to go to Asia.
其他人则强烈反对，因为他们注意到利率水平持续保持低位，市场预期净借贷成本在2010、2011年到2014、2015年间将会下降二分之三，比前届政府所希望的还要低。	Others strongly disagree, noting the continued low level of interest rates, and that even under the previous government’s plan, net borrowing costs were already scheduled to fall by nearly two-thirds between 2010-11 and 2014-15.
目前，该领域每年的投资规模大约为2,700亿美元，产生令人瞩目的五十万项发表成果，但只能带来20—30种新药。	As it stands, roughly $270 billion is invested in the field each year, producing an impressive half-million research publications, but only 20-30 new medicines.
大学校长必须致力于增加本校的引用记录，尽管他们知道这些数据的准确性和有效性以及它们所衍生的排名大有可疑。	University presidents must work to boost their institutions’ citation records, even though they know that the validity and reliability of these data, and the rankings that they inform, are questionable.
尽管这本身不会造成太大影响，但波兰的政治痼疾却迟早会带来危险，因此无论是新老民主，都应该时刻保持警惕。	There is nothing devastating in this, of course, but Poland’s political malaise may one day prove dangerous, and so should be scrutinized in other democracies, old and new.
年轻的查谟和克什米尔邦行政长官阿卜杜拉（Omar Abdullah）定期上Twitter与粉丝互动，而长他好几岁的拉贾斯坦邦和喀拉拉邦行政长官格洛特（Ashok Gehlot）和钱迪（Oommen Chandy）也开了Facebook账户。	Similarly, Omar Abdullah, the youthful Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, regularly interacts on Twitter, and his much older Rajasthan and Kerala counterparts, Ashok Gehlot and Oommen Chandy, respectively, have opened Facebook accounts as well.
在2012年里约+20峰会（Rio+20 Summit）的倡导下，70个国家的政府（包括40个中低收入国家）支持自然资本核算。	Following a campaign at the 2012 Rio+20 Summit, 70 governments, including those representing 40 middle- and low-income countries, endorsed natural capital accounting.
通过将推动和推广恐怖主义视为一项国家政策工具，巴基斯坦似乎根本不想重新赢得信任，而没有了信任，自1947年英属印度分裂以来失落的和平就无法归来。	In promoting and pursuing terrorism as an instrument of state policy, Pakistan seems intent on never regaining that trust, without which peace, unseen in South Asia since the partition of British India in 1947, is impossible.
早教具有显而易见的经济好处 — — 更不用说公民高涨的早教投资意愿了 — — 现在必须把目标定在找到有效方式并根据不同环境进行调整上。	Given the clear economic case for it – not to mention citizens’ demonstrated willingness to invest in it – the goal now must be to figure out what works and adapt it to different contexts.
比如，在欧元区，许多成员国的总需求一直受到德国巨大的经常项目盈余（2015年占GDP的8.5 % ） 等因素的制约。	In the eurozone, for example, aggregate demand in many member countries has been constrained by, among other things, Germany’s large current-account surplus, which amounted to 8.5% of GDP in 2015.
当政客不得不在社会和衣食父母之间做出选择时，他们极有可能会放任社会紧张发展 — — 即使到达了危险水平 — — 而不愿牺牲自身权力基础。	When forced to choose between their societies and their clientele, politicians may well decide that allowing social tensions to rise – even to dangerous levels – is better than sacrificing their own power bases.
正如曾经长期主持与伊朗谈判的欧盟首席外交官 哈维尔·索拉纳（ Javier Solana）所指出的那样，即便联合国安理会批准对伊朗实施制裁，通往谈判的大门也永远是敞开的。	As Javier Solana, the European Union’s chief diplomat, who has conducted lengthy negotiations with Iran, rightly points out, even if the United Nations Security Council approves sanctions against Iran, the door to negotiations will always be open.
斯托克霍姆—在最近对阿富汗和巴基斯坦的访问中，一件令我不得不关注的事情是国际社会越来越频繁的“结束”阿富汗的声音。	STOCKHOLM – On a recent visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan, I could not fail to notice the increasingly frequent international calls for an “endgame” in Afghanistan.
全球而言，已有超过22.8万亿美元 — — 占专业资金管理总量的四分之一 — — 投入了可持续投资。	Globally, more than $22.8 trillion – one-quarter of all funds under professional management – has been channeled into sustainable investment.
矛盾的是，欧盟委员会和英国强硬退欧派都有可能接受这一主岛的结果，除非后者拒绝接受主岛和北爱尔兰之间的边境。	Paradoxically, both the European Commission and hardline Brexiteers could agree on this outcome for mainland Britain, except that the latter refuse to accept a border between the mainland and Northern Ireland.
最近的哥伦比亚正是如此，选民以微弱多数拒绝了政府与哥伦比亚革命武装力量（FARC）之间克服万难才达成的和平协议。	That is precisely what happened in Colombia recently, when voters narrowly rejected a laboriously negotiated peace accord between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
可以通过手机操作的移动支付和数字钱包消除了在农村地区携带实体现金的需要。 由于金融服务的缺乏，在非洲农村地区携带大笔现金是很危险的。	Mobile money and digital wallets accessed on cellphones eliminate the need for physical cash in rural areas, where financial services are limited and carrying large amounts of cash is risky.
核事故、公众反对和高投资成本已经导致核能投资急剧下降；20世纪70年代后期以来，美国再没有委托建造任何核电厂。	Nuclear accidents, public opposition, and high capital costs have already provoked a drastic drop in nuclear-energy investment; in the United States, no nuclear-power plant has been commissioned since the late 1970’s.
这一切会因为海平面上升而进一步恶化，本世纪末海平面可能上升1.4米（4.6英尺 ） ， 可能导致诸多国家丧失超过总面积10%的领土。	All of this would be exacerbated by rising sea levels, which could be 1.4 meters (4.6 feet) higher by the end of the century, potentially causing many countries to lose more than 10% of their land area.
对许多韩国年轻人来说，拜住房成本和年轻人失业率等因素所赐，如今连结婚也未必结得起，即使是大学毕业生也是如此。	For many young South Koreans, even marriage is economically unfeasible nowadays, owing to factors like high housing costs and youth unemployment, even among university graduates.
幸运的是，南非宪法法院已经裁定死刑不合乎宪法，这种刑罚在南非人民从种族隔离制度下解放出来的同时即被宣告废止。	Mercifully, South Africa’s Constitutional Court has ruled that the death penalty – which South Africans eliminated at the same time we were liberated from apartheid – is unconstitutional.
逊尼派阿拉伯政党起初不愿接受任何邦联国家理念，但随着时间推移，他们开始相信什叶派政党永远不会自愿分权。	The Sunni Arab parties initially rejected any notion of a confederated state, but in time they came to believe that the Shia parties would never share power voluntarily.
事实上，除了野生浆果、野生动物、野生菌类以及鱼类和贝类，北美和欧洲餐桌上几乎所有东西都通过某种方式进行过基因改造。	Indeed, with the exception of wild berries, wild game, wild mushrooms, and fish and shellfish, virtually everything in North American and European diets has been genetically improved in some way.
阿盟应该要求美国不辜负它的价值观、追求它的利益，而与此同时，阿盟应该承担起其自身作为地区组织的责任。	The League would be asking the US to live up to its values and pursue its interests, while at the same time fulfilling its own responsibility as a regional organization.
事实上，笔者与亚洲开发银行的韩雪辉研究表明，当美国提高或降低利率时，大多数使用弹性汇率的发展中国家往往也会跟风。	Indeed, my research with the Asian Development Bank’s Xuehui Han has shown that when the US raises or lowers interest rates, most developing countries tend to follow suit, even when they have a flexible exchange rate.
突尼斯是一个种族分布相对均匀，缺乏尖锐教派分歧的国家；尽管如此，由于与阿尔及利亚和利比亚接壤，暴力的幽灵一直存在。	Tunisia is relatively homogeneous ethnically and lacks sharp sectarian divisions; nonetheless, owing partly to its porous borders with Algeria and Libya, the specter of violence is always present.
当然，国际协定限制了这些手段的使用，以保证相对开放的全球经济，这能带来极大的总体好处（尽管好处和成本的分配仍是决策者面临的挑战 ） 。	Of course, international agreements limit such measures in order to preserve a relatively open global economy, which yields large aggregate benefits (even as the distribution of benefits and costs remains a challenge for policymakers).
海洋是地球最后也是规模最大的全球公共资源，占地球表面的近50 % ， 需要全球团结和行动来消除它所面临的威胁。	The high seas are the earth’s last great global commons, representing nearly 50% of the planet’s surface, and the multiple threats they face require universal solidarity and action.
中国政府需要更努力地通过常规手段实现经济再平衡，但与此同时也应该更关注调整总资产和总负债的货币结构。	While China’s government should make greater efforts to rebalance the economy by conventional measures, it also should focus more attention on adjusting the currency structure of the country’s gross assets and gross liabilities.
相关人员背景既可以出自世俗也可以来源宗教；既可以追求中产阶级正常生活也可以信奉以色列版天命 — — 这两者似乎水火不容。	This identity may be secular or religious; it may seek middle-class normality or proclaim an Israeli version of manifest destiny – the two are not incompatible.
黎巴嫩战争严厉地提醒欧盟，它具有“战略利益 ” ， 首先而且最重要的是安全利益，而且，如果它有意回避这些利益，代价将是巨大的。	The Lebanon War has served as a harsh reminder to the European Union that it has “strategic interests” – security interests first and foremost – and that, should it choose to ignore them, the price will be high.
克里姆林宫放弃了民主程序，控制着那些政党可以被允许竞选及其侯选人，而普京的统一俄罗斯垄断了媒体报导。	The Kremlin abandoned democratic procedures, controlling which parties were allowed to run and their candidates, while Putin’s United Russia monopolized media coverage.
虽然居伦的支持者最初在正义与发展党治下共享特权红利，包括在政府雇用及合同方面的优惠待遇，但紧张局势却在2013年达到了高潮，当时居伦派份子试图将埃尔多安牵连进一场腐败案件调查。	Though Gülen’s supporters initially shared the privileges of power under AKP rule, including preferential treatment in government hiring and contracts, tensions came to a head in 2013, when Gülenists tried to implicate Erdoğan in a corruption probe.
私有化允许个人设立私人储蓄账户，而社会保障制度投资低回报率的国库券。 曾有一度，前者看起来优于后者。	There was a time when privatization – allowing individuals to set up individual savings accounts – seemed better than Social Security, which invests in lower-yielding Treasury bills.
伯克利—几年前，我发现当今社会科学家都站在马基雅维利、洛克、斯密、托克维尔、马克斯·韦伯和涂尔干等巨人的肩上。	BERKELEY – Several years ago, it occurred to me that social scientists today are all standing on the shoulders of giants like Niccolo Machiavelli, John Locke, Adam Smith, Alexis de Tocqueville, Max Weber, and Émile Durkheim.
作为微软预感计划（Project Premonition）研究的一部分，这一陷阱原型使用红外线光束来识别特定的蚊子物种并具备超过80%的准确性。	Part of Microsoft’s Project Premonition research initiative, the prototype trap uses an infrared light beam to identify specific mosquito species with more than 80% accuracy.
如果市场混淆了中国的长期日程或对此表示悲观，但结构性变化和改革的方向是积极的，那么将会出现在刚刚过去的较为繁荣的光景中所找不到的投资机会。	If markets are confused or pessimistic about China’s longer-term agenda, but if the direction of structural change and reform is positive, there may be investment opportunities that were absent in the more exuberant recent past.
如今，印地语报纸发行量已经名列前茅：连续两个十年增长最快，2006年以来发行量平均复合年增长率达到了8.78 % 。	Today, they are on top: for the second decade in a row, Hindi newspapers experienced the fastest growth, with average circulation soaring at a compounded annual growth rate of 8.78% since 2006.
此次谈判史称圆桌会议，并由此拉开了1989年6月4日共产党世界首次竞争性 — — 尽管还不是完全自由的议会选举的序幕。	The negotiations, known as the Round Table Talks, led to the Communist world’s first competitive – though not entirely free – parliamentary election, on June 4, 1989.
如果我们用局部条件对嗅觉建模，我们可以追踪鼻腔神经元如何与气味粒子互动、通过其他神经元网络将信号输送给大脑。	If we model smell on local terms, we can trace how nasal neurons interact with scent particles, sending signals through a network of other neurons to the brain.
如果哈梅内伊迅速攫紧权力，穆斯维就难以到总统之位，但他至少还继续承载着那些与政府意见相左的大多数伊朗人的期望。	If Khamenei holds fast, Mousavi cannot gain the presidency, but he will continue to represent the hopes of the majority of Iranians who differ dramatically with their government.
还有其他克里姆林宫支持者，包括那些想照旧与俄罗斯做生意的公司领袖以及那些为苏联做辩护的学者，在苏联解体25年后，他们终于看到了正名的机会。	There are other Kremlin supporters as well, including corporate leaders who want to return to business as usual with Russia, and academic apologists for the Soviet Union who, 25 years after its collapse, see a chance for vindication.
但最古怪的说法来自于前纽约市市长鲁迪·朱利安尼（Rudy Giuliani ） ， 他在写给穆勒的信后加入了总统阵营。	But the most outlandish claim was made by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who joined the president’s team after the letters to Mueller were written.
美国由于忽视了必要的基础设施投资而走上了一条可能导致停滞和衰落的危险的道路，这条道路一旦走上就很难回头。	In neglecting the necessary investments, the US has put itself on a precarious path, one that could lead to stagnation and decline, which would be difficult to reverse.
就像巨蟒剧团（Monty Python）的都市恐怖故事《地狱奶奶 》 （ Hell’s Grannies ） ， 未来的老者必然会发出他们的声音。	Like Monty Python’s city-terrorizing “Hell’s Grannies,” tomorrow’s elderly will surely make their voices heard.
此外，尽管数据不足，但MENA贫困率早已是发展中国家中最低的，而一些阿拉伯之春席卷的国家 — — 主要是突尼斯 — — 的贫困率在继续下降。	Moreover, despite the paucity of data, poverty ratios, already among the lowest in the developing world, were falling in some of the countries swept up by the Arab Spring – most notably, in Tunisia.
但他们的女儿米卡得到了一张复制椅 — — 用相同的原料在稍稍添加一点东西做成 — — 以庆祝她又大了一岁。	But their daughter Mika got a reprinted chair made from the same old materials plus a little more, marking her growth from her last birthday.
为了更好地做好准备以处理未来流行病，世界必须从现在开始投资于强化公共卫生体系、提高发展中国家的疾病预防能力，并创造灵活的新融资工具。	In order to become better prepared to tackle future pandemics, the world must invest now in strengthening public-health systems, bolstering developing countries’ disease-prevention capacity, and establishing new and flexible financing instruments.
有一点可以确定 — — 世界上没有绝对的安全，然后从历史的角度来看，恐怖主义浪潮往往需要一代人的时间才能消退。	To be sure, there is no such thing as perfect safety, and, historically, waves of terrorism have often taken a generation to recede.
这要求接受在私人和公共部门债务上的巨大损失，并支付巨大的转移成本以提振产出停滞不前的外围国的收入水平。	This would require accepting massive losses on public and private debt, as well as enormous transfer payments that boost the periphery’s income while its output stagnates.
因此2010年患者保护和平价医疗法（Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act，即“奥巴马医保 ” ） 等强制性个人医疗保险十分必要，要不然就得咬紧牙关采取单一支付的医疗融资系统了。	Hence the necessity of something like the individual health-insurance mandate of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”), or of biting the bullet and adopting a single-payer system for financing health care.
许多重要问题将挤爆特朗普的外交政策日程，但其中一些问题最为重要 — — 即与中国和俄罗斯的大国关系，以及中东动荡。	Many important issues will crowd Trump’s foreign policy agenda, but a few key issues will likely dominate – namely great power relations with China and Russia and the turmoil in the Middle East.
当然，专利体系本身就是一种奖励体系，不过是很特殊的一个。 那就是其奖励是一段时间的垄断权，从而给新知识所带来的利益赋予高价并且限制进入。	Of course, the patent system is itself a prize system, albeit a peculiar one: the prize is temporary monopoly power, implying high prices and restricted access to the benefits that can be derived from the new knowledge.
芒克指出，决策成为“字母汤”监管机构的自留地 — — 从环境保护署（EPA）到食药监督局（FDA ） 。	As Mounk notes, policymaking is the province of an alphabet soup of regulatory bodies – from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
历史学家罗伯特·卡甘（Robert Kagan）在2002年指出，美国人和欧洲人不但世界观不同；所处的世界也完全不一样。	As the historian Robert Kagan argued in 2002, Americans and Europeans do not only have different worldviews; they occupy entirely different worlds.
美联储可能“逐步减少”其量化宽松（QE）等迹象让投资者争相降低新兴市场风险敞口，导致新兴市场货币大幅贬值、股价崩盘。	Indications that the US Federal Reserve might “taper” its quantitative easing (QE) drove investors to reduce their exposure to emerging markets, sharply weakening their currencies and causing their equity prices to tumble.
按照特朗普的说法，这些新举措将在煤炭行业创造新的工作岗位，实现美国“能源独立 ” ， 并促进经济增长。	According to Trump, these new measures will create new jobs in the coal sector, achieve US “energy independence,” and boost economic growth.
在任何资源丰富、不民主的国家，政治阶层以及伴随其左右的商业利益几乎没有什么意愿加强产权和法治，提升竞争力。	In any resource-rich and undemocratic country, the political class and the business interests that surround it have little or no incentive to support stronger property rights, the rule of law, and competition.
美国疾病控制与预防中心确认当今儿童的血液中含有二十年前并不存在的数十种化学物质，其中包括许多已知会导致癌症和一系列其他疾病的破坏基因的化合物。	America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirm that children’s blood today contains dozens of chemicals that did not exist two decades earlier, including many gene-damaging compounds known to cause cancer and a host of other diseases.
1930年，美国推出史穆特-霍利关税（Smoot-Hawley Tariff ） ， 超过20,000中商品因此需要缴纳进口税。	In 1930, the US enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which raised import duties on more than 20,000 goods.
例如，它可能实现对自然资源更环保及更高效的利用，或者投资于更适应人类需要也能更好地与人类互动的各项服务。	For example, it could lead to more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient uses of natural resources, or to investment in services that are more responsive to human needs and better attuned to human interaction.
回到欧洲，著名的建筑及设计师，被称为勒·柯布西耶的夏尔·爱德华·让纳雷则勾勒出与自然无缝衔接的乌托邦城市愿景 。	And back in Europe, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, an architect and designer known as Le Corbusier, was sketching visions of utopian cities that seamlessly enveloped the natural world.
我们需要的不是夸夸其谈，而是为找到地区和国家合作所迫切需要解决的重要问题的实际并且前瞻性的解决方案而付出头脑清醒的努力。	What is needed is not rhetoric, but levelheaded efforts to find practical and forward-looking solutions to key issues on which regional and international cooperation is urgently required.
但尽管我们以无限的热忱寄望这次盛会能够增进人们互相之间的了解，但一场表演，一部电影或者一场艺术展显然并不能解决所有那些割裂美国与伊斯兰世界的难题。	Despite our enthusiasm for the possibilities of what this initiative can do to broaden understanding, a performance, a film, or an art exhibition cannot find solutions to all of the problems that divide Americans and the Muslim world.
但是，不管他们的奖牌数是否赶得上美国，有一件事是肯定的：中国的邻居兼区域地缘政治对手印度，即使获得一枚奖牌，那也是它运气好。	Whether or not they overtake the US, however, one thing is certain: China’s neighbor and regional geopolitical rival, India, will be lucky to win even a single medal.
美国、墨西哥和加拿大等国签订的1994年北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）等地区协定是一场“彻头彻尾的灾难 ” ， 彻底缚住了美国的手脚。	Regional deals, such as the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Mexico, and Canada, are a “total disaster” that have tied America’s hands.
最后，关于委内瑞拉将对最多800亿美元的对外债务违约的猜测甚嚣尘上，其主权债务收益率飙升至15%也就不足为奇了。	Finally, amid widespread speculation that Venezuela may indeed default on up to $80 billion of foreign debt, it is not surprising that yields on its sovereign debt have hit 15%.
但是贺胥黎思考是的下面这个问题，未来的统治精英通过如《美丽新世界》描述的性诱惑、娱乐和其它形式的娱乐活动努力使得被统治者与他们保持一致，这难道不是更有可能出现的吗？	But wasn’t it more likely, Huxley mused, that future ruling elites would strive to keep the governed in line by distracting them with sexual allurement, entertainment, and other forms of pleasure, à la Brave New World?
只有把更多的时间花在与出色的宏观经济学家而不是交流而不是健康问题上的人才能知道，如果经济可以在充分就业水平上实现再平衡，他们还可以做得更好。	Only those who spend more time talking to competent macroeconomists than is healthy know that they could be doing even better if the economy were rebalanced at full employment.
伯克利-虽然奥巴马新政府统领着全球注意力，美国的未来却可能-正如以前曾多次出现的那样-由其最大州决定。	Berkeley – While the new Obama administration is commanding global attention, America’s future may be written – as so many times before – in and by its largest state.
"美国防部称上述变动是所谓""驻外美军重新部署计划""的组成部分，目的是更灵活机动地把军队部署到全球更急需的地区。"	"The US Defense Department justifies this change as part of the so-called ""Global Posture Review"" that it has been carrying out to provide more flexibility and mobility in deploying troops to more urgently needed places around the world."
日本已经决定向乌克兰提供1,500亿日元的经济援助，这是到目前为止包括美国在内的最大一笔单国援助承诺。	Already, Japan has decided to provide ¥150 billion ($1.5 billion) in economic aid for Ukraine, the largest pledge by any individual country, including the US, thus far.
在这样的环境下，领导人必须尽快构想并给出包容性经济增长的清晰愿景，这一愿景不仅要考虑税收和贸易政策 — — 这两个问题是当今诸多争论的焦点 — — 也要考虑数字化。	In this environment, it is imperative that leaders articulate and deliver on a clear vision for inclusive economic growth, one that accounts not only for tax and trade policy – the focus of many of today’s debates – but also for digitization.
我们认为坐在学校里只是第一步；我们希望激励儿童成为领导者和企业家，并将学校学到的技能应用于改善他们的社区和国家。	In our view, finding a seat in school is only the first step; we want to inspire children to become leaders and entrepreneurs, and to apply skills learned in school to improving their communities and countries.
而他们会面带微笑、招手致意，并把身上碰巧带着的小礼物扔给我们－纸牌啦、口香糖啦、救急的糖果啦…在我们眼里，他们简直就是来自另一个世界的英雄 。 ”	They would smile and wave and throw us whatever gifts they happened to have – playing cards, chewing gum, lifesaver candies….For us they were like heroes from another world.”
这有助于防止政府对公私合作项目的担保给预算带来大于或等于GDP的1%的成本，哥伦比亚、印度尼西亚和葡萄牙都超过了这一标准。	This will help to prevent government guarantees for public-private partnerships from imposing budgetary costs equivalent to one or more points of GDP, as has happened in Colombia, Indonesia, and Portugal.
与此同时，我建议在您的旧电脑上安装微软补丁（ http : / /office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA100444731033.aspx ） ， 从而将麻烦减少到最低限度。	In the meantime, I recommend installing the Microsoft patch to your old computer ( http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA100444731033.aspx ) and just suffering the devil you know.
法国总统尼克拉斯·萨尔科奇坚持要求对土耳其加入欧盟进行全民公投，这说明多年的为符合欧盟规则而进行的痛苦调整不可能得到取得欧盟成员资格的结果。	French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s insistence that a referendum should be held on Turkey’s admission suggests that years of painful adjustment to EU norms will never produce the payoff of membership.
为了满足全球每年720万吨巧克力的需求量，好时公司等跨国企业需要数百万个可可农场，每个农场的种植面积都相当小，通常为1—2公顷。	To meet global demand for 7.2 million metric tons of chocolate annually, multinationals like Hershey rely on millions of cocoa farmers, each of whom farms a tiny plot, often 1-2 hectares (2.5-5 acres).
委员会集合了相关重要部门的部长，起到了协调和加快决策的作用，最初的几次会议就批准了数百亿美元的支出项目。	By bringing together the key ministers, the committee has coordinated and accelerated decision-making, and has already approved tens of billions of dollars in spending in its first few meetings.
在这方面，当前的趋势是权力和控制日益向中央政府而非私人部门集中，这有可能在全球经济进入更高发展阶段时对中国起到妨碍作用。	Here, the current trend toward higher concentration of power and control in the central government, as opposed to the private sector, could hamstring China as the global economy reaches higher stages of development.
这肯定好过富豪统治中的财富决定地位，也强过老人政治中的年龄决定尊卑。 甚至连贵族政治都难望其项背，因为决定贵族地位的不过是与生俱来的头衔和财产。	It is certainly preferable to a plutocracy, in which wealth determines status, or a gerontocracy, in which age leads one to the top, or even an aristocracy, in which what counts are inherited titles and properties.
这一知识水平下滑趋势表现出年龄特征；2016年的一项针对有大学文凭的美国人的研究发现，65岁以上的人对政府工作的了解比34岁以下的人好得多。	This slippage is apparently age-dependent; a 2016 study of Americans with university degrees found that those over 65 years of age know far more about how their government works than those under 34.
麻省理工学院的安德鲁·迈克菲指出，从历史上看，技术革命“最终创造出更多、但有可能不同的工作机会 ” ， 但随着机器越来越聪明 ， “ 这次带来的结果可能存在差异 。 ”	As MIT’s Andrew McAfee pointed out, historically, technological revolutions have “eventually led to more, if different, jobs”; but, with machines becoming increasingly intelligent, “this time may be different.”
他们资助伪科学、收买研究人员和批评家、转嫁责任、宣传政府弱监管，甚至将其产品销售给儿童（托尼虎是早餐麦片行业的领军企业，就像烟草行业的骆驼一样 ） 。	They funded shoddy science, co-opted researchers and critics, shifted blame, advocated for weaker government oversight, and even marketed their products to children (as with Tony the Tiger, breakfast cereal’s equivalent of Big Tobacco’s Joe Camel).
而如今人们则需要求助于气候经济学家来指点一下那些针对全球变暖的不同应对措施所可能带来的效益，成本以及可能引起的后果。	Now we need to turn to climate economists to enlighten us about the benefits, costs, and possible outcomes from different responses to this challenge.
达拉斯—关于气候变化，一项最新的消息着实令人担忧：至2050年，大片人口稠密地区将被淹没，而坐落在此的城市也将“灰飞烟灭 ” 。	DALLAS – The latest alarming news about climate change is that huge swaths of densely inhabited land will be underwater by 2050, with their cities “erased.”
如果你询问一国两制模式的设计师邓小平香港回归20周年纪念日应当是什么样子，他可能会说香港居民会为了繁荣和自由而举杯庆贺。	If you had asked Deng Xiaoping, the architect of the “one country, two systems” model, what the handover’s 20th anniversary would look like, he might have said that Hong Kong’s residents would be toasting to their prosperity and liberty.
法国和德国拥有可跻身二十世纪最伟大政治家行列的戴高乐和阿登纳，他们能够拨开琐碎政治的迷雾，认清历史大势。	In Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, France and Germany had two of the twentieth century’s greatest statesmen, leaders who were able to discern the broad sweep of history through the fog of quotidian politics.
自然，让以色列强硬派感到遗憾的是，布什政府快走到尽头了，因为他们知道，即使奥巴马总统不大刀阔斧地改变美国对以色列的政策，一旦他上了台，他也不会重复布什政府对以色列无条件地支持的政策。	Hardliners in Israel naturally regret the end of the Bush administration, for they know that, even if President Barack Obama does not dramatically change US policy toward Israel once he assumes power, he will not repeat Bush’s unconditional support.
社会可以让自由市场分配这一成果，或者实施干预来把成果转向最为弱势的群体，这样，某���人得到的要比他们的边际产品要多，而另一些人则要少。	A society can let the free market distribute this gain, or it can intervene to direct it to the least advantaged, so that some get more than their marginal product, others less.
例如，美国证券交易委员会已经在探讨这些问题，并同时分析响应投资者和企业环境、社会、治理需求的备选政策。	The US Securities and Exchange Commission, for one, is already discussing these issues, as it analyzes options to respond to investor and business needs regarding ESG.
事实上，没有它们，去年的中美减少碳排协议等协议 — — 更不用说“我们需要商业 ” （ We Mean Business）等动员商界的计划了 — — 就不可能发生。	Indeed, agreements like last year’s deal between China and the United States to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions – not to mention initiatives to mobilize business, such as We Mean Business – are unlikely to happen without them.
当西方还在疲于应付突尼斯，摩洛哥以及埃及改革派伊斯兰主义者的迅速崛起之际，巴勒斯坦地区哈马斯的角色冲突问题也日渐升温。	As the West grapples with the rapid rise of moderate Islamists in Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt, the issue of Hamas’s role in the Palestinian territories looms large.
英国需要 — — 而且仍然需要 — — 能让民众接受的目标，告诉人们如何能够通过建设欧盟来改善自己的生活。	What the UK needed – and still needs – is a vision, put to the people, of how to make itself better by making the EU better.
美国和欧盟（它们对库尔德人独立的概念反应都相当冷静）的一个选择是支持或参与库尔德斯坦地区政府（KRG）和伊拉克政府在巴格达的谈判。	One option for the US and the European Union (which has been similarly cool to the idea of Kurdish independence) would be to support or participate in negotiations between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Iraqi government in Baghdad.
这是个及时的行动，因为过去15年中，强制处理美国联邦氦储备系统的巨量氦储备让美国中西部的大量氦生产商倒闭，也让其他地方的工程推迟（见图 ） 。	The move is timely, because the mandated disposal of such a large volume of helium from the US Federal Helium Reserve over the last 15 years has displaced many helium producers in the American Midwest and deferred projects elsewhere (see graph).
阿巴斯就可以声称，他已经建议哈马斯续订停火协议并结束对以色列城镇的导弹袭击，但是，哈马斯却坚持使巴勒斯坦平民遭受战争的荼毒。	Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns, but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation.
你想必也没有忘记安德鲁·威廉·梅隆（Andrew William Mellon）的鲁莽的著名建议：在大萧条前夕，他建议美国总统胡佛“出清劳动力，出清存货，出清农民，出清房地产 。 ”	And one should not forget Andrew William Mellon’s infamous and reckless advice to former US President Herbert Hoover on the eve of the Great Depression: “liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate.”
在实践中，这意味着失业不会通过扩大公共部门人手来解决，而是通过强化培训解决，培训的项目要反映企业的真实需要。	In practice, this means that unemployment would be addressed not by expanding the public-sector workforce, but by strengthening training via programs that reflect businesses’ real needs.
他可能不再原因充当国王，但显然还可以成为拥立国王的人，因为他是意大利最大传媒集团Mediaset的控制着。	He may not wish to be king again, but he certainly can be a kingmaker, owing to his control of Mediaset, Italy’s largest media group.
如今，他的第二故乡的媒体仍然在遭受攻击，他本人的被谋杀案件也迟迟得不到解决，他对乌克兰的信念没有获得回报。	Today, as attacks on the media continue in his adopted homeland, and with his own murder unsolved, the faith he placed in Ukraine is not being repaid.
德国将在2017年举行大选，如今，极右翼的德国另类党（AfD）正在崛起，在最近的州选举中表现抢眼就是明证。	In Germany, which will hold a general election in 2017, support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is on the rise, exemplified in the party’s strong showing in recent state elections.
真相是欧盟对于减少不规律人员流入起着重要作用，自2015年大量叙利亚难民经由希腊和匈牙利涌入以来，难民人数大幅下降。	The truth is that the European Union has been instrumental in reducing the flows of irregular arrivals, which have declined considerably since the massive influx of Syrian refugees, via Greece and Hungary, in 2015.
如果不采取这个第一选择 — — 考虑当前的政治边缘政策博弈，这一幕很有可能发生 — — 希腊将违约。	If this first option is not taken – the likely outcome, given the current game of political brinkmanship – Greece will default.
这篇文章的出现时一个清晰的信号，表明中国领导人正在讨论，如果金氏政权倒台，他们可以进行多少程度的干涉。	The article’s appearance is a clear sign that China’s leaders are debating how deeply they can afford to be drawn in if the regime collapses.
目前，美国政治中的一些最保守元素 — — 他们的后台是亿万富翁大卫和查尔斯·科奇（David and Charles Koch）兄弟，在气候变化问题上无动于衷对他们最有利 — — 正在试图抹黑方济各的观点。	Already, some of the most conservative elements in American politics – backed by those, like the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, who benefit from inaction on climate change – are attempting to denounce Francis’s views.
简言之，虽然拉美经济受益于商品价格高企，但无可争议的是多数国家实行的重大经济改革也使他们把这场灾难转化为“良性危机 ” 。	In short, while Latin America’s economies were helped by high commodity prices, it is indisputable that the significant economic reforms adopted in most countries enabled them to have a “good crisis.”
强化的区域控制还将有利于更好地信息分享和决策，暗示着清迈协议的危机借款中与国际货币基金组织相关的部分能在增强经济研究室能力和表现的同时得到削减。	Enhanced regional control would contribute to better information-sharing and decision-making as well, implying that the IMF-linked portion of CMIM crisis lending could be reduced in step with the strengthening of AMRO’s capacity and performance.
与此同时，政治领导人承诺的将惠及所有人的改革 — — 例如贸易和金融自由化 — — 却未能兑现，甚至遥遥无期。	At the same time, reforms that political leaders promised would ensure prosperity for all – such as trade and financial liberalization – have not delivered. Far from it.
在这种情况下，经济学家眼中的坏事对世界经济而言却是件好事：我们面对的也许只是美国的金融衰退，而不是居高不下的长期利率和全球经济萧条。	In this case, what is bad for economists is good for the world economy: we may be facing a mere episode of financial distress in the US rather than sky-high long-term interest rates and a depression.
太阳能姐妹（Solar Sister）是一家社会企业，已经为尼日利亚、坦桑尼亚和乌干达销售廉价太阳能灯具的2，500名女性创造了就业机会。	Solar Sister is a social business that has created jobs for 2,500 women selling affordable solar lighting in Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda.
1993年6月，在与美国对华和威胁退出核不扩散条约（NPT）后，朝鲜允许国际原子能机构（IAEA）进行有限度的“保障活动 ” 。	In June 1993, following talks with the US and a threat to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), North Korea allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct limited “safeguards activities.”
最低限度要对治疗HIV病毒的抗逆转录酶药物采取安全措施，因为这种药对剂量变化和与其它药的相互作用极其敏感。	Safety regulations must, at a minimum, be applied to the prescription of the anti-retroviral medications that fight HIV, because such drugs are extremely sensitive to dosage changes and interactions with other medicines.
托尼·布莱尔、雅克·希拉克、柯菲·安南和其它人在阿拉法特死后的讲话都迫切要求尽快结束冲突，这样的解决已经来得太迟了。	Statements by Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, Kofi Annan and others on the occasion of Arafat’s death have been forceful in demanding a speedy and long overdue resolution of the conflict.
最近 ， “ 哥本哈根共识”计划聚集了一些世界顶尖的经济学家来商议如何在这个资源有限的世界为我们这个星球贡献最大的利益。	Recently, the Copenhagen Consensus project gathered some of the world’s leading economists to decide how to do the most good for the planet in a world of finite resources.
令人遗憾的是，成果还没来得及在企业界得到应用，这项研究计划就被取消了，这几乎毫无疑问是因为大公司的利益受到了威胁。	Unfortunately, the research program was cancelled before its findings could be applied in the business world, almost certainly because it threatened large companies.
事实上，当年维尔先促成了花旗和某大型保险商的合并意向 — — 当时，根据格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案，这是非法的 — — 然后设法推动了该法案的废除，从而让合并得以成行。	In fact, he engineered an agreement to merge Citi with a large insurer – illegal at the time under Glass-Steagall – and then pushed for the law’s repeal, so that the merger could proceed.
数据告诉我们有15-20%的类日恒星孕育的世界与地球大小相似，其运行轨道与恒星的距离可能带来温和的地表温度。	The numbers tell us that 15-20 percent of Sun-like stars harbor worlds similar in size to the Earth, orbiting stellar parents at distances implying that their surfaces might be temperate.
再平衡会导致中国的盈余储蓄减少，外汇储备的增加也会大幅放缓，同时也减少其对美元资产似乎如饥似渴的需求。	With rebalancing will come a decline in China’s surplus saving, much slower accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves, and a concomitant reduction in its seemingly voracious demand for dollar-denominated assets.
另一个主要担忧是，如果企业不再能够“走后门 ” — —即贿赂官员允许他们规避过度监管 — — 业绩将受到影响。	Another major concern is that, if businesses are no longer able to “grease the wheels” – that is, bribe officials to allow them to circumvent excessive regulations – their performance could suffer.
尽管该省一直取得缓慢而稳步的进展，但是其未来还是受困于日益恶化的水源短缺；尽管黄河横跨该省，但是其地下水正在快速下降。	While it has been making slow but steady progress, its future is clouded by worsening water shortages; though it straddles the Yellow River, the water table is dwindling fast.
另外，亚洲新兴工业国家的投资率也从来没有恢复到1997-1998年金融危机以前的水平。 而除中国以外的其他亚洲地区的投资率也下降了。	Moreover, investment rates in the newly industrialized economies of Asia have never recovered to their pre-1997-8 crisis levels, and investment rates in the rest of Asia outside China have fallen off as well.
但将核武数量削减到如此之少将给那些小型核武国家以可乘之机，令他们自认自己的核潜力已经和大国站在同一个水平线上了。	But cutting nuclear weapons to a bare minimum in the current conditions would give a big advantage to small nuclear powers, which will see their nuclear potential gain near-parity with larger states.
这是非常惊人的回报，一个由诺贝尔奖得主组成的委员会研究了联合国的新全球目标，结论是控制结核病是应该列为全球重中之重的19项卓越发展投资之一。	Those are outstanding returns, and a panel of Nobel laureates that studied the United Nations’ new Global Goals determined that controlling TB is one of 19 phenomenal development investments that should be given high priority globally.
实际上，大多数经济学派认为，政府的主要职责之一就是延缓周期，而“现实”商业周期理论认为减少动荡就是减少福利！	In fact, whereas most schools of economic thought maintain that one of government’s key responsibilities is to smooth the cycle, “real” business-cycle theory argues that reducing volatility reduces welfare!
因此，不难预见，托马斯·皮克提（Thomas Piketty）的《二十一世纪资本论 》 （ Capital in the Twenty-First Century）一时洛阳纸贵。	So, predictably, Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century has been a big hit.
如果政策制定者忽视特定地区或部门的损失，那么后果就是民众的愤怒和社会分化 — — 并对经济的运行轨迹持消极态度。	When policymakers ignore losses in particular regions or sectors, the result is anger and social division – and negative views about the economy’s trajectory.
首先我们知道妇女生育头一胎的年龄越小，婴儿死亡率的风险也会随之而增加，但现代医学和保健学已经令这个概率大大降低，减少了低龄生育的风险。	First, we know that giving birth for the first time when younger carries a cost in increased infant mortality, but modern medicine and hygiene have strikingly reduced infant mortality, reducing the cost of younger age at first birth.
上述言论值得我们留意，要知道出于公众对不受控移民的强烈反对而令英国脱欧公投“脱”派得胜也仅仅不过是两年前的事而已。	This is notable, considering that it has been only two years since a widespread public backlash against uncontrolled immigration delivered a victory to “Leave” in the Brexit referendum.
接着，如果他弄丢了要是或需要一把备用钥匙，他可以在任何有KeyMe销售终端的地方得到新的复制品 — — 该公司希望，KeyMe销售终端会很快大量铺开。	Then, when he loses the key or needs a spare, he can get a new copy at any location with a kiosk – of which there will soon be many, the company hopes.
他曾是共和党操盘手罗杰斯通的商业伙伴，而后者与特朗普的关系一直是非常亲密的（穆勒正在将关注的重心移到斯通身上 ） 。	He was also a former business partner of Republican operative Roger Stone, who remained close to Trump. (Mueller’s spotlight is now moving toward Stone.)
耶路撒冷-以色列是现代社会最成功的故事之一，这是一个由大屠杀的幸存者和流离失所的犹太人群体重新组成的国家。	JERUSALEM – Israel is one of the biggest success stories of modern times.

大麻种植依然是非法的，而咖啡店的销售则受到管制 — — 且在周边各国纷纷抱怨本国公民赴荷兰享受“毒品之旅”之后，管制也有逐渐收紧之势。	Marijuana cultivation remains illegal and coffee shop sales are regulated – more strictly in recent years in response to complaints from neighboring countries about “drug tourism.”
一位不愿受到打扰的教授的怒火并非探讨无数贫困的无名人士所处困境的最佳方式，这些无名的小人物太容易被我们所忽略。	Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless, poor, anonymous people, whom most of us find it too easy to ignore.
同埃及“沉默的大多数”相契合的，是各种伊斯兰团体所代表的现实，在这些团体眼中，民主和公民权等等是西方舶来的空洞字眼。	Egypt’s silent majority also identifies with the authenticity represented by various Islamic groups, while principles of democracy and civil rights seem to them to be imported Western abstractions.
当我们选择一项事业或者配偶，或是一个政治家从一堆可能性中抓住一个机会的时候，当务之急往往都是基于不完整的信息来做出可能引发连串后果的决定。	When we choose a career or a spouse in our private lives, or when a politician seizes an opportunity from a plethora of possibilities, the task at hand is always about making highly consequential decisions based on imperfect information.
但两个派别 — — 伊朗强硬派和现任美国政府中的鹰派 — — 之间的的协同和相似性反常地高，并且影响深远。	But synergies and similarities between two factions – Iranian hardliners and the hawks of the current US administration – are as counterintuitive as they are profound.
投资银行根据多方面的指标被排名。 大学也是如此 — — 有学术成果排名、环境管理实力排名、甚至对同性恋学生吸引力排名。	Investment banks are ranked on a variety of metrics, as are universities – from academic results to their prowess in environmental management, or their appeal to gay students.
由于民营企业无法享受到这样的官方保护，因而必须在相当不公平的竞技场上竞争，它们就必须在生产率和竞争力上远远超过国有企业。	Given that private firms enjoy no such official protections and thus play on a field that is nowhere near level, they must be substantially more productive and competitive than the SOEs.
与此形成鲜明对照的是，反对父母那一代的观点，重新发掘传统的道德准则能够拯救法国¾这样的观点对教育和移民等问题都大有裨益，而上述问题在竞选活动中占据了主导地位。	By contrast, rebelling against one’s parents’ generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France – a message that is highly applicable to issues, such as education and immigration, that may dominate the electoral campaign.
除了给亚投行的500亿美元初始投资，中国还向其丝绸之路基金新注资400亿美元，向国家开发银行新注资320亿美元，向国家进出口银行新注资300亿美元。	In addition to its initial contribution of up to $50 billion to the AIIB, China has committed $40 billion to its Silk Road Fund, $32 billion to the China Development Bank, and $30 billion to the Export-Import Bank of China.
用进口弥补储量的下降 — — 大约一半的天然气储量和五分之一石油储量已经被用掉了 — — 意味着每年要花去3000亿美元以上的成本。	Covering this drop in reserves – more than half of gas reserves and a fifth of oil reserves have been consumed – with imports implies an annual cost of more than $300 billion.
随着她们投入到工作当中，她们的语言能力得到提高，家庭收入增加，而她们的孩子则亲眼看到了一个有尊严，有经济能力的女性。	As they enter the workforce, their language skills improve, their household income soars, and their children see firsthand a woman in a respected, economically valued role.
她最近吹嘘说伦敦是世界金融之都，却并未意识到这主要是由于外国银行聘用外国工作人员（所谓“世界公民 ” ） 来为包括欧盟在内的国际市场服务而构建的。	She recently boasted that London is the world’s financial capital, without acknowledging that this is thanks mostly to foreign banks that employ foreign staff (those “citizens of the world”) to serve international markets, including the EU’s.
作为占收入的份额，它在第10百分位上的70 ％ ， 大幅下降至顶端的-16 ％ （ 换句话说，顶端收入人群支付的税额比它收到的政府补助金更多 ） 。	As a share of income, it declines sharply from 70% at the 10th percentile to -16% at the top (in other words, the top bracket pays more in taxes than it receives in government benefits).
正如布雷顿森林框架在二战后重建了国际经济秩序，以真正的国际货币为基础的新的货币安排能够强化当前所急需的经济和金融稳定。	Just as the Bretton Woods framework restored order to the global economy after WWII, a new monetary framework, underpinned by a truly international currency, could strengthen much-needed economic and financial stability.
诸如“四海之内皆兄弟 ” 、 “有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎”等等将传播给全球几十亿观众，展示中华文化精华。	Such sayings as “The world’s peoples are all brothers” and “Isn’t one of life’s greatest pleasures to have friends visiting from afar?” will be beamed to billions worldwide, expressing the best that Chinese culture has to offer.
YouGov/Times最近的一项民意调查预测，保守党将获得44％的选票，而工党，自由民主党和独立党的得票分别为23 % ， 12%和10 ％ 。	A recent YouGov/Times poll predicted that the Conservatives would receive 44% of the vote, compared to 23% for the Labour Party, 12% for the Liberal Democrats, and 10% for the UK Independence Party.
相反，经业内审议的大部分经济证据表明截止到2050-2070年左右，因气温上升所造成的净全球经济影响可能是正面的。	On the contrary, the bulk of peer-reviewed economic evidence indicates that, up to around 2050-2070, the net global economic impact of rising temperatures is likely to be positive.
如果不是逊尼派的经济当权派确实纪录不佳，那么上述这一切可能就会被看成是对迫在眉睫的改革的情理之中的保守反应了。 逊尼派多年以来对叙利亚的控制早已是服服帖帖。	All this might be seen as a predictable, conservative reaction to urgently needed reforms, were it not for the poor track record of the Sunni economic establishment, which for many years adapted well enough to Syrian domination.
尽管捷克将会在一月担任欧盟轮值主席，但是这并没有阻止法国总统在2009年上半年主持召开一次新的欧盟首脑会议。	Although the Czech Republic will assume the EU presidency in January, this has not prevented the French President from convening a new EU summit under Sarkozy’s leadership in the first half of 2009.
正如我们一直以来所说的那样，如果政府能坚持中期财政整顿和改革计划，那么债务水平应当可以保持稳定或下降态势，从而减轻与债务相关的难题。	As we have been saying for some time, if governments stick to their medium-term fiscal-consolidation and reform plans, debt levels should stabilize or decrease, alleviating debt-related challenges.
它们不堪难民涌入的重负，难民数量已达200—400万，并以每个月50,000—100,0000人的数量增加。	They are adversely affected by the flow of refugees, which already numbers 2-4 million and is growing at a rate of 50,000-100,000 per month.
在获得最低工资的工人中，一半以上是妇女，其中许多人的大部分收入来源是小费，因为政府允许餐馆支付令人震惊的2.13美元/小时最低工资。	Among workers earning the minimum wage, more than half are women, and many of them depend on tipping for the bulk of their income, as restaurants are permitted to pay a shockingly low minimum wage of $2.13 per hour.
当盟友都得不到基本的尊重 — — 记得乔治·W·布什臭名昭著地称呼“哟，布莱尔 ” ， 仿佛时任国首相托尼·布莱尔是个什么牧童 — — 人们自然会怀疑自己的国家是否也被美国当作仆从。	When even allies are treated with disrespect – recall George W. Bush’s infamous shout of “Yo, Blair,” as if then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair were some cowhand – people naturally wonder whether their country, too, is deemed subservient.
而由于中国在苏丹进行了大规模投资以开发当地的石油资源，因此它所持的外交立场将成为一块试金石，考验该国是否真的希望在非洲以及全世界范围内成为一个负责任的利益相关者。	And China’s diplomacy in Sudan, where it has invested massively in developing the country’s oil resources, will be a test of whether or not it intends to be a responsible stakeholder in Africa and the wider world.
中国向富强的狂奔使它很难有机会来发展所有的补偿机构，而这是任何真正发达更别提是开明的社会为实现平等和社会的健康所必需要做到的。	China’s mad rush toward fuqiang (wealth and power) has given it little chance to develop all the compensatory institutions that any truly developed, not to say enlightened, society needs to achieve equilibrium and social health.
在莱特兄弟和柯蒂斯兄弟最初的创新工作后，重复的专利申请严重阻碍了飞机的研制，一直到第一次世界大战爆发前，美国政府强制推行专利共享制度，这个问题才最终得以解决。	After the pioneering work of the Wright brothers and the Curtis brothers, overlapping patent claims thwarted the development of the airplane, until the United States government finally forced a patent pool as World War I loomed.
巴基斯坦在塔利班的凶猛攻势面前深受重创；北约士兵则在阿富汗伤亡惨重；而中东地区所谓“和平进程”只是矛盾修饰法在国际关系中的一大应用这一点，也变得更加清晰了。	Pakistan is hit hard by a wave of monstrous Taleban attacks, and in Afghanistan NATO troops die and are terribly injured in large numbers. The “Peace Process” in the Middle East becomes ever more clearly the great oxymoron in international relations.
在接下来的十年中朝鲜进行了五次核试验 — — 最近那次在今年9月 — — 并展示了开发先进热核武器所需的精湛技术。	In the ensuing decade, North Korea has conducted five more nuclear tests – most recently in September – and demonstrated the technological mastery needed to develop advanced thermonuclear weapons.
但重要的私人医疗系统成本遏制变化，包括私人保险计划承担部分增加和收紧管理式保健（managed care）的控制，也是减速的原因。	But important cost-containing changes in the private health-care system, including more cost-sharing in private insurance plans and tighter controls in managed care, have also contributed to the slowdown.
同时金融部门的问题可能尤其棘手：如果政治家们过度强调行动的紧迫性以换取授权，结果往往非但没能遏制危机，反而加速其爆发。	At the same time, financial-sector problems may be particularly difficult to address: if politicians emphasize the need for action too strongly in order to get a mandate, they might precipitate the very turmoil that they seek to contain.
由无拨付退休金数额较大的管理者经营的银行在金融危机中的表现比同业更好，这应该是因为他们有更大的激励保证银行安全。	Banks overseen by managers who had larger unfunded pensions weathered the financial crisis better than their counterparts, presumably because they had a stronger incentive to keep them safe.
从男性的角度看，求助于外来的警察或司法力量意味着没有能力独立作战 — — 这等同于承认失败并接受象征性的阉割。	From the male point of view, resorting to outside police or judicial intervention would signify an inability to fight one’s own battles – an admission of defeat and a symbolic castration.
债权人越是坚持要求降低生活水平和提高税收，波多黎各岛的税基就会更快地离开这里 — — 导致债券持有人损失增加。	The more creditors insist on lower living standards and higher taxes, the more the tax base will simply leave the island – causing bondholders’ losses to rise.
同样，评估海地最佳发展政策的研究发现通过使用强化面粉重点改善营养能够彻底改变幼儿的健康状况，并终身为其带来好处。	Likewise, research assessing the best development policies for Haiti found that focusing on improvements in nutrition through the use of fortified flour would transform the health of young children, creating lifelong benefits.
数十年来，IMF的项目一直在腐蚀巴基斯坦的政府治理和国家能力，并为愈演愈烈的寻租和腐败行为创造了条件，最终削弱了该国的生产力和增长潜力。	For decades, IMF programs have been undercutting Pakistan’s productivity and growth potential, by eroding governance and state capacity, and creating conditions for ever more rent-seeking and corruption.
上个世纪最著名的两位奥地利经济学家约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter）和弗雷德里希·哈耶克（Friedrich Hayek）也抨击了将经济视为机器的观点。	Joseph Schumpeter and Friedrich Hayek, the two most famous Austrian economists of the last century, also attacked the view of the economy as a machine.
总统候选人米特·罗姆尼及其竞选搭档保罗·莱恩所抛出的预算方案能够减少财政赤字，但将恶化其他三大赤字。	The budget proposals put forward by presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, could reduce the fiscal deficit, but would exacerbate the other three.
任何对糖尿病的诊断或是随后的病情发展监测都需要回顾患者医疗记录并调阅病历 — — 因此进入诊所的患者管理信息系统。	Any diagnosis of diabetes, or subsequent monitoring of disease progression, requires a medical consultation and hence an entry into the patient record – and so into the practice’s patient-management information system.
确实，托克维尔所称的“社会力量”对于观点的控制在民主制度中可能最为强劲。 他的这一观点预言了当代蛊惑人心和媒体操纵的增长。	Indeed, what Tocqueville called the hold of “social power” on opinion is probably strongest in democratic regimes – a view that foretells the growth of modern-day demagogy and media manipulation.
其他消费品也在发生同样的事情：如今我们将洗衣机和恒温器连接在一起，更不用说蓝牙牙刷和计算机化的婴儿称了。	The same thing is happening to other consumer goods: We now have connected washing machines and learning thermostats, not to mention Bluetooth toothbrushes and computerized infant scales.
叙利亚政权一直积极利用上述不确定情绪传播对埃及局势的恐惧，即世俗活动人士的缺乏导致国家被穆斯林兄弟会和圣战组织所占据。	The regime has been effective in exploiting that uncertainty by spreading the fear of an Egyptian scenario, in which the weakness of secular activists leads to a takeover by the Muslim Brothers and jihadis.
在这次会议上，加拿大计划联合几个北极和非北极成员国，共同提出限制在北极航行的船只使用和运输重油的战略计划。	At that meeting, Canada, along with a number of Arctic and non-Arctic member states, will propose a strategy for limiting the use and transport of HFO by ships in the Arctic.
这份名为“城市供水蓝图”的报告分析了534座城市及2，000个流域的供水状况，全面总结了能与传统基础设施相结合的潜在的自然解决方案。	The report, “The Urban Water Blueprint,” analyzes the state of water supplies in 534 cities and 2,000 watersheds to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential natural solutions that can be integrated with traditional infrastructure.
去年11月，在几年西非国家中央银行（Central Bank of West African States）成立50周年的会议上，塞内加尔总统麦基·萨尔（Macky Sall）要求削减利率。	Last November, at a conference marking the Central Bank of West African States’ 50th anniversary, Senegalese President Macky Sall pleaded for an interest-rate reduction.
对于美国当局而言，他们视发生在阿富汗、伊拉克、巴勒斯坦以及黎巴嫩的真主党的反恐战争的每个行动都是互不相关、各成一体的。	To the US administration, every act in the drama of the war on terror was seen as discrete and self-contained: Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
CBS新闻的另一则秘密报道采访了一位年仅十二岁的女孩，她用一张伪造的年龄证书得到了一份制衣厂的工作。	Another undercover report by CBS News interviewed a 12-year-old girl who obtained a factory job using a certificate that falsified her age.
在欧洲，我们很大程度上未能对2007年夏天美国次贷危机爆发的警告信号予以足够的重视。 因此当危机的第二阶段席卷欧洲各银行时，我们毫无防备。	In Europe, we by and large failed to heed the warning signals of America’s sub-prime mortgage crisis when it erupted in the late summer of 2007, and thus were unprepared when the next phase of the crisis engulfed European banks, too.
9月以来在日本政府、商界和劳工领袖间进行的激烈讨论正在产生向上的良性循环 — — 工资增加带来更鲁棒的增长。	Intensive discussions since September among Japanese government, business, and labor leaders have been geared toward setting in motion an upward, virtuous cycle whereby increased wages lead to more robust growth.
为了评估原因，最近牛津大学纳菲尔德学院组织了一次研讨班，讨论的焦点是缺少一个主权实体有能力保护作为一个整体的欧洲经济免受肇始于其他地区的危机的影响。	To assess why, a recent symposium on the subject at Nuffield College, Oxford, focused on the lack of a sovereign authority able to protect the European economy as a whole from contagious crises starting elsewhere.
他们邀请慈善组织申请两万五千美元的赠款用于五大人道主义领域，而申请程序要求提供他们所一直要求提供的信息。	They invited charities to apply for grants of $25,000 in five broad humanitarian categories, with the application process demanding the kind of information that they had been seeking.
最为重要的是，贸易政策必须既要自由，还要公平(不仅对美国工人公平，还要对亚洲工人公平 ) ， 同时还要让亚洲放心，奥巴马了解他们的需要。	Most importantly, a trade policy must be articulated that is both free and fair (not only for US workers, but also for Asian workers), and that reassures Asians that Obama will be aware of their needs.
相反，其政策转变是遏制中国的最后机会，否则中国就将得到在亚洲和其他地区取得地缘政治上风所需要的关键性技术。	On the contrary, its policy shift amounts to its last chance to stop China before it secures the critical technologies it needs to gain the upper hand geopolitically in Asia and beyond.
据刚刚发布的IndyStar和《今日美国》的联合调查，过去20年，美国至少有368名体操运动员曾指控某种形式的性侵犯。	According to a just-released joint investigation by the IndyStar and USA Today, at least 368 gymnasts in the United States have alleged some form of sexual abuse over the last 20 years.
第一个变量与资产负债表相关：许多西方国家都必须处理因过往过度借债和杠杆化所留下的烂摊子；而德国这类不存在类似问题的国家也会受到邻居的牵连。	The first relates to balance sheets. Many Western economies must deal with the nasty legacy of years of excessive borrowing and leveraging; those, like Germany, that do not have this problem are linked to neighbors that do.
虽然2011到2015年间世界各国的公共媒体预算都没有增长，例如，欧洲广播联盟56个成员国的公共媒体资金下降了40 % — —但政府资金仍然颇具影响力。	While public media budgets have not grown everywhere – between 2011 and 2015, for example, funding for public media dropped in 40% of the European Broadcasting Union’s 56 member countries – government cash remains influential.
为了维持一党执政的合法性 — — 以及治国能力 — — 这些狭隘利益集团必须被打倒，以保证一般利益。	To maintain single-party legitimacy – and thus the ability to govern – those narrower interests must be overridden in favor of the general interest.
因为特朗普政府放弃了奥巴马时代对使用空中力量的限制，由美国领导伊拉克摩苏尔联盟“获胜”造成数千民众伤亡并留下了一堆废墟。	As a result of the Trump administration’s abandonment of Obama-era restraints on the use of airpower, a US-led coalition “victory” in Mosul, Iraq, caused thousands of civilian casualties and left a pile of rubble.
如果将所有私人银行存款都转成央行数字货币，那么传统银行将需要转型为“可贷资金中介机构 ” ， 通过借入长期资金来为抵押贷款等长期贷款提供资金。	If all private bank deposits were to be moved into CBDCs, then traditional banks would need to become “loanable funds intermediaries,” borrowing long-term funds to finance long-term loans such as mortgages.
或者，如精神病医生兹维·瑞斯（Zvi Rex）的名言所说 ， “ 由于奥斯维辛，德国人永远不会原谅犹太人 。 ”	Or, as the psychiatrist Zvi Rex famously quipped, “Germans will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz.”
这台西班牙大戏的演员们正面临着被政治学家称之为社会困境的局面：冲突的任何一方均可从自利行为中获益，除非另外一方也同样采取自利的行为。 但如果双方都坚持自利的原则，那么双方都会失败。	The actors in the Spanish drama are facing what political scientists call a social dilemma: either side gains from selfish behavior unless the other side behaves selfishly, too, in which case both sides lose.
随着货币政策分歧的压力日趋增大，多速经济表现将带来多样化的央行政策，特别是在具系统重要性的发达经济体。	This multi-speed economic performance will contribute to multi-track central banking, as pressure for divergent monetary policies intensifies, particularly in the systemically important advanced economies.
几乎每天都有新证据表明，危机 — — 从恐怖主义和武器扩散到网络攻击和海盗 — — 范围正在从中东和萨赫勒向中亚蔓延。	Virtually every day brings fresh evidence that an arc of crisis – from terrorism and weapons proliferation to cyber-attacks and piracy – is spreading from the Middle East and the Sahel to Central Asia.
这一持续的脆弱性反映出全球货币体系改革的集体失败 — — 中国人民银行行长周小川在2009年初就强调了改革的重要性。	This continued vulnerability reflects a collective failure to reform the global monetary system – an imperative that People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Zhou Xiaochuan highlighted in early 2009.
纽约 — — 2011年，一系列小概率大事件冲击了全球经济，尽管如此，金融市场持续上行，直至一个月前为止。	NEW YORK – Despite the series of low-probability, high-impact events that have hit the global economy in 2011, financial markets continued to rise happily until a month or so ago.
EADS与BAE联姻最有力的理由是行业分析家预测在20年内，中国将在成就强大的全新国防工业的同时，对空客和波音在全球航空市场的地位形成挑战。	One of the most powerful arguments for the EADS-BAE marriage had been the expectation of industry analysts that within 20 years China will challenge Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market, while also creating a powerful new defense industry.
发自新德里 — — 2007-2010年金融危机的其中一个正面效应就是让我们认识到：金融产品可以像药品一样复杂而危险。	NEW DELHI – One positive fallout of the financial crisis of 2007-201? is our realization that financial products can be as complex and dangerous as drugs.
退出欧元区正是新成立的“德国替代方案 ” （ Alternative for Germany）党的要求，该党受到了社会的广泛支持。	Leaving the eurozone is precisely what the newly founded “Alternative for Germany” party, which draws support from a wide swath of society, is demanding.
在 2005 年大多数时间，美国消费者的表现好像是没有真正相信油价会居高不下，或至少暂时会居高不下。	For most of 2005, Americans behaved as if they didn’t really believe that oil prices would remain high, at least for a while.
尽管领土纠纷往往具有历史和政治重要性，但它们的经济重要性往往是次要甚至微不足道的，除非中国东海和南海这样的紧张局势失控。	While territorial disputes often are historically and politically important, their economic significance is usually minor, even minuscule, unless tensions like those in the East and South China Seas are allowed to get out of hand.
但过去几周油价进一步暴跌 — — 跌到了2008年全球金融危机爆发后的所达到的低位 — — 原因何在，对世界经济会造成怎样的影响？	But what accounts for the further plunge in oil prices in the last few weeks – to lows last seen in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis – and how will it affect the world economy?
更广地说，自1946年以来，铜、铝、铁和锌供给都超过了需求，这要归功于新储量的发现和更经济的新提炼技术。	More broadly, since 1946, supplies of copper, aluminum, iron, and zinc have outstripped consumption, owing to the discovery of additional reserves and new technologies to extract them economically.
如果允许赤贫增加，这将引起新问题，包括新的疾病将从不能提供充分的医疗保健的那些国家蔓延到那些可以提供的国家。	If extreme poverty is allowed to increase, it will give rise to new problems, including new diseases that will spread from countries that cannot provide adequate health care to those that can.
在这样的情况下，一位出色的领导者即便拥有一群精明强干的幕僚和充满希望的政策，也无法实施他的雄图大略。	Under such circumstances, even a brilliant leader, with an able staff and promising policies, will be unable to pursue his agenda.
会议讨论的主题是民粹主义，而这位野心家名叫马克·琼根，他是一位拥有哲学博士学位的极右翼德意志民主党（AfD）政治家。	The conference was about populism, and the ideologue was named Marc Jongen, a politician from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party with a doctorate in philosophy.
近些年来，单单中国政府就在非洲的基础设施和资源采掘上投资了几十亿美元，从而使人们怀疑他们正在对非洲实行一轮新的掠夺。	In recent years, China’s government alone has invested billions of dollars in African infrastructure and resource extraction, raising suspicions that a new scramble for Africa is underway.
坎布里奇—7月23日，国际货币基金组织（IMF）西半球主管亚历杭德罗·沃纳（Alejandro Werner）表示，IMF预计今年年底委内瑞拉通货膨胀率将达到1,000,000 % 。	CAMBRIDGE – On July 23, Alejandro Werner, the Director of the International Monetary Fund’s Western Hemisphere Department, announced that the Fund was expecting inflation in Venezuela to reach 1,000,000% by year’s end.
一些民主，协商，透明的做法 - - 比如博茨瓦纳所采用��那些做法 - - 更加能够保证国家的财富果实得到公平有效的利用。	Democratic, consensual, and transparent processes - such as those in Botswana - are more likely to ensure that the fruits of a country's wealth are equitably and well spent.
但是，就象是棉花革命一样，个人电脑所制造的社会和政治变革的真实程度只有在更长的一段时间以后才可以见分晓。	But, like the cotton revolution, the true measure of the social and political transformations wrought by the PC will become clear only after a much longer time.
巴黎 — — 2003年，在雅克·希拉克总统执政期间，法国领导了反对美国入侵萨达姆·侯赛因治下伊拉克的运动。	PARIS – In 2003, France, under President Jacques Chirac, took the lead in opposing America’s planned invasion of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.

据该机构估计，欧洲铀资源需求量将从2010年的2.1747万当量吨下降到2018年的1.7378当量吨，最终降低到2024年的约1.6万当量吨。	According to the agency’s forecast, uranium demand in Europe will fall from 21,747 tons in 2010 to 17,378 tons by 2018 and roughly 16,000 tons by 2024.
它们也倾向于更快地发展以及更加多元化，这不仅是因为坐拥更大的国内市场，同时也由于拥有更多元化的产品可以出售给其他国家和城市。	They tend to grow faster and become even more diversified, not only because they have a larger internal market, but also because they are more diversified in terms of what they can sell to other cities and countries.
经济学的如此扩张背后的统一的基本思想是不管人们做什么，是做爱还是做小东西，他们的目标都是以最小的代价获得最好的结果。	The unifying idea underlying this extension of economics is that whatever people do, whether it is making love or making widgets, they aim to achieve the best results at the least cost.
）然而，进口货物的需求仍然巨大—促进健康的药物，缩小发展中国家和世界其他地区知识鸿沟的技术，以及用于提高生产力的机器设备。	But there continues to be an enormous need for imported goods – medicines to promote health, technology to reduce the knowledge gap between the developing countries and the rest of the world, and machines to enhance productivity.
第一点教益是比尔·克林顿（Bill Clinton）在1992年提出的著名竞选口号 — — “笨蛋，经济才是关键 ！ ” — — 本身就非常愚蠢，或者说至少是不充分的。	The first pointer is that Bill Clinton’s famous campaign slogan from 1992 – “It’s the economy, stupid” – is itself stupid, or at least insufficient.
不论这场动乱是否会最终实现普希金的预言，都将撕裂俄罗斯 — — 并将今天的未来沙皇抛入历史的垃圾桶。	Whether or not that upheaval finally fulfills Pushkin’s prophecy, it would tear Russia apart – and most likely drive today’s would-be czar into the dustbin of history.
在伊斯兰共和国未能兑现其对伊朗民众所做出的经济和政治承诺的时刻，伊朗政府最突出的弱点可能莫过于缺少一个可信的宗教权威机构，能够为政府存在的种种缺陷找出正当的理由。	At a time when the Islamic Republic has failed in its economic and political promises to the Iranian people, the regime’s most glaring weakness may prove to be the absence of a credible religious authority that can justify its shortcomings.
第二，如何对待外国储户尤其是俄罗斯储户的问题，连同比邻叙利亚的影响，将救助塞银行业变成一个国际关系问题。	Second, the question of foreign, and especially Russian, depositors – along with proximity to Syria – has turned the rescue of the Cypriot banking sector into an international relations problem.
如果说加沙的景象在法国引起了极大共振，那么部分原因就在于惊人的数字：欧洲最大穆斯林社区遇上了欧洲最大犹太社区。	If the images from Gaza seem to resonate so much in France, it is partly a matter of sheer numbers: the largest Muslim community in Europe faces the largest Jewish community in Europe.
将保险原则应用于贸易风险是如此困难的其中一个原因在于，如果政府提供针对自由贸易生计风险的保险，那看起来就像是重新分配。	One reason why it has been so difficult to apply the principle of insurance to trade risks is that if the government offers the coverage against risks to livelihoods from free trade, it just looks like redistribution.
真正的触发点应该是当地政府本身，因为对于所有面临着大型银行崩溃的政府来说，在这些事件中拒绝国际救助无异于政治自杀。	The trigger should be the domestic government itself. Refusing international help in such instances would mean electoral suicide for any government that faces a major bank collapse.
同样，全球一体化意味着欧元区的困境同样会威胁到美国经济，而美国的债务上限僵局又会影响到全球各国金融市场。	Likewise, global integration means that eurozone distress threatens the US economy, while the US debt-ceiling standoff threatens financial markets everywhere.
尽管全球人才竞赛最初导致发达国家设立特殊签证以吸引高技术专业人才，这些国家对移民的政治情绪却已由此转向负面。	Though the global talent race initially led developed countries to create special visas to attract high-skilled professionals, political sentiment toward migrants in those countries has since turned negative.
想想与叙利亚形成鲜明对比的利比亚吧，美国干预的结果是千万利比亚人民举着支持美国的横幅走上街头，对美国大使的遇害表示愤怒和悲痛。	Consider the contrast with Libya, where one of the outcomes of US intervention was tens of thousands of Libyans marching in the streets with placards declaring their support of the US and their outrage and sorrow at the murder of the US ambassador.
因奥巴马担心俄罗斯会将攻击升级，破坏选举设施或投票设备，进而危及希拉里的胜选，所以不愿公开抨击俄方或采取强硬行动。	But Obama was reluctant to call out Russia publicly or to take strong actions for fear that Russia would escalate by attacking election machinery or voting rolls and jeopardize the expected victory of Hillary Clinton.
它们的诉讼战略利用了标准的契约条款（称为平权条款 ） ， 该条款的本意是确保所有债权人得到平等对待。	Their litigation strategy took advantage of a standard contractual clause (called pari passu) intended to ensure that all claimants are treated equally.
看来，引入“人类世”的概念来描述现在的人类主宰的时代比较合适，作为一个地质时代，它是“全新世”的下一代。	It seems appropriate to assign the term “Anthropocene” to the current, in many ways human-dominated, geological epoch, supplementing the Holocene – the warm period of the past 10–12 millennia.
正在崛起的新兴当权派极不情愿的达成共识：全球化加剧了阶级分裂，拉大了有资源和有能力利用世界市场者和不具备上述能力者之间的鸿沟。	As an emerging new establishment consensus grudgingly concedes, globalization accentuates class divisions between those who have the skills and resources to take advantage of global markets and those who don’t.
事实上，中国治理污染和环境破坏、同时转向更为可持续的增长模式的努力能够为全世界政府提供极有价值的教益。	Indeed, China’s efforts to curb pollution and environmental destruction, while shifting to a more sustainable growth model, can provide valuable lessons for governments worldwide.
他认为萨达姆·侯赛因对科威特的入侵和征服不仅会威胁到该地区的关键石油供应，还有损于新兴的冷战后世界。	He viewed Saddam Hussein’s invasion and conquest of Kuwait as a threat not just to the region’s critical oil supplies, but also to the emerging post-Cold War world.
事实上，我强烈质疑，如果你对投资者做一番调查就会发现，货币政策赫然居于全球低长期利率原因清单的榜首而非无人提及。	In fact, I strongly suspect that if one polled investors, monetary policy would be at the top of the list, not absent from it, as an explanation of low global long-term interest rates.
虽然他一心想要增加法国劳动力市场的灵活性，但同时又想阻止外国公司收购法国公司并保护空中客车公司的工人不被裁员。	Although he does want to make the French labor market less rigid, he would block foreign takeover bids of French companies and protect Airbus workers from possible job losses.
当然，伊朗的决策者没有人会从美国在伊拉克取得成功受益。 美国成功就会把伊朗政权更迭重新放到议程上去。	Of course, no Iranian decision-maker is interested in a US-success in Iraq that might well put regime-change in Iran back on the agenda.
对奥巴马这个不平凡的美国总统来说，此番针对伊斯兰世界的戏剧性开场白只不过是一系列政策启动计划的最新一幕而已。	Obama’s dramatic overture to the Islamic world was only the latest in a series of such openings by this remarkable US president.
这种战略让公众所产生的兴趣并不会随着布什政府的终结而结束，因为新保守主义依靠的深深植根于美国历史的公众对许多问题的担忧。	That strategy’s popular appeal will not end with the Bush administration, because neo-conservatism feeds on a set of public fears that are deeply rooted in American history.
此外，卡钦斯基很容易引发公众情绪失控，而如果他担任总理职务 — — 他肯定需要当众演讲 — — 甚至偶尔回答记者提出的问题。	Kaczyński is, moreover, already prone to public outbursts, and he would have been expected to speak publicly – and even to answer occasional questions from journalists – were he to have assumed the premiership.
冷战后，核武器库存有所减少（主要是出于经济原因 ） ， 目前全世界还有不到20,000核武器（仍足以将全人类毁灭好几次 ） 。	Nuclear stockpiles were reduced – mainly for economic reasons – following the Cold War, to less than 20,000 nuclear weapons worldwide (still enough to destroy humanity several times over).
12月26日，安倍将与奥巴马在珍珠港握手 — — 在此之前几周，是珍珠港被日本偷袭75周年的日子。 安倍访问珍珠港是对奥巴马去年5月访问广岛原子弹爆炸点的回访。	On December 26, Abe will shake hands with Obama at Pearl Harbor – weeks after the US marked the 75th anniversary of the Japanese attack there – to reciprocate Obama’s visit to Hiroshima’s atomic bomb sites last May.
在那个时候，历史学家和社会学家研究复国主义所谓的“罪责 ” 。 例如，以色列的阿拉伯公民直到今天从来没有享受过平等的民权。	Back then, historians and sociologists dug into Zionism supposed “sins” – for example, that Israel’s Arab citizens have never, to this day, enjoyed equal civil rights.
根据国际能源署的最新《世界能源投资 》 （ World Energy Investment）报告，2016年全球石油和天然气行业总支出高达6,490亿美元。	According to the most recent World Energy Investment report from the International Energy Agency, global expenditure in the oil and gas sector totaled $649 billion in 2016.
即使是运营良好的银行系统在希腊和西班牙这一级别的经济衰退中也会面临问题，随着西班牙房地产泡沫的崩溃，其银行的风险更大。	Even well-managed banking systems would face problems in an economic downturn of Greek and Spanish magnitude; with the collapse of Spain’s real-estate bubble, its banks are even more at risk.
如今，他在国际货币基金组织的同事，前西班牙财长罗德里戈·拉托（Rodrigo Rato）也宣布将于10月离任，这接踵而来的变故令主要利益相关人士惊诧不已。	Now, his counterpart at the International Monetary Fund, the former Spanish Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato, has shocked major stakeholders by announcing that he, too, will leave in October.
法塔赫中央委员会的成员已经开始指责阿巴斯在本次战争中支持以色列，想“坐在以色列的坦克上返回加沙 ” 。	Members of Fatah’s Central Committee are already accusing Abbas of supporting Israel in the fighting, of wanting to “return to Gaza on an Israeli tank.”
目前为止，抑制公共负债的举措都集中在痛苦的紧缩措施之上，包括对公共产品供应（尤其是医疗教育）的持续削减。	So far, efforts to curb public debt have centered on painful austerity measures, including substantial cuts in the supply of public goods, especially health care and education.
但就国际竞争力来说，最基本的一点是特朗普提出的税收计划 — — 特别是边境调整税 — — 很可能不会对美国的贸易平衡产生积极影响。	But in terms of international competitiveness, the bottom line is that Trump’s proposed tax plan – particularly the border-adjustment tax – would most likely not have a positive impact on the US trade balance.
某些国家在边界内自我封闭的倾向是不合时宜和自暴自弃的，但如果其他国家因为害怕被传染就避免与这些国家接触也是一种严重的错误。	The preference of some countries to isolate themselves within their borders is anachronistic and self-defeating, but it would be a serious mistake for others, fearing contagion, to respond by avoiding engagement with these states.
它在格鲁吉亚爆炸了一枚“偏离方向”的导弹，警告第比利斯政府及其西方盟友。 它用侦察飞机监视美国在太平洋岛屿关岛上的军事基地。	In addition, each winter there is a repeated threat of “problems” with oil and gas deliveries to Europe.
如果习近平及其同事不能给出可信的政治改革承诺信号，那么一切都只是表面文章，而对其领导下的中国命运持悲观态度者将最终胜出。	If Xi and his colleagues produce no credible sign of such a commitment, everything else will be eyewash – and skepticism about China’s fate under their leadership eventually will be vindicated.
但是，成功地将这些进步转化为下一代疫苗的开发仍受到我们关于人体对具体细菌、病毒和寄生虫的免疫反应的了解不足的制约。	However, successfully translating these advances into the development of next-generation vaccines continues to be impeded by gaps in our understanding of the human immune response that protects against specific bacteria, viruses, or parasites.
另外，黎巴嫩的安全和独立也与叙利亚息息相关，叙利亚也在以色列和其阿拉伯邻国之间的冲突中扮演着重要角色。	Moreover, Lebanon’s security and independence hinges on Syria, and Syria is one of the main actors in the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
纽约 — — 2015年，几乎全部来自发展中国家的约590万5岁以下儿童死于可以轻松预防或治疗的原因。	NEW YORK – In 2015, around 5.9 million children under the age of five, almost all in developing countries, died from easily preventable or treatable causes.
此外，正如恐怖分子2001年袭击美国所表现出的那样，如果被用以伤害当今全球的脆弱生命，即使是像纸箱切割刀这样基本的武器也会成为大规模杀伤性武器。	Moreover, as the terrorist attacks on America of 2001 showed, weapons as basic as box-cutters can become weapons of mass destruction if they are used to exploit the vulnerabilities of modern, global life.
雅典—国际货币基金组织（IMF）首席经济学家奥利佛·布兰查德（Olivier Blanchard）最近提出了一个简单而重要的问题 ： “ 希腊应该做出多大调整，它的官方债权人又应该做出多大调整 ？ ”	ATHENS – The International Monetary Fund’s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, recently asked a simple and important question: “How much of an adjustment has to be made by Greece, how much has to be made by its official creditors?”
尽管它并未暗示何时利率会上升以及会升到何种程度，但国会预算办公室（CBO）预计，十年期美国国债利率将在2019年升至5%以上，并在未来五年中一直高于5 % 。	Although it has not indicated just when rates will rise or how high they will go, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the rate on ten-year Treasuries will rise above 5% by 2019 and remain above that level for the next five years.
制造弹道导弹所需要的知识正被越来越多的国家掌握，导弹的射程也越来越远，某些欧洲大西洋以外地区已经能对欧洲城市发动袭击。	The know-how needed to build them is spreading, and their range is increasing, with some from outside the Euro-Atlantic region already capable of targeting European cities.
但那样的政策几乎每次都会削弱总需求��把经济推入更深的深渊，进一步又会瓦解信心 — — 20世纪90年代国际货币基金组织给一些东亚国家就是开了这种药方，你看后来怎么样？	But those policies almost always reduced aggregate demand, pushed the economy into a deeper slump, and further undermined confidence – most recently when the International Monetary Fund insisted on them in East Asia in the 1990’s.
范龙佩的眼光显然会比一个任期六个月的国家总统更为长远，而阿什顿女士则能够把欧盟对外政策的政治与资源整合起来。	Van Rompuy will be able to offer a longer view than that of a six-month national presidency. Lady Ashton should be able to tie together the political and resource arms of Europe’s external policies.
胡耀邦赞扬了中曾根康弘的勇气并公开警告中国年轻人如果他们“只考虑自己国家的利益，就不是头脑冷静的爱国者 。 ”	Hu praised Nakasone’s courage and warned Chinese youth publicly that if they “think merely of the well-being of their own country… they are not sober-minded patriots.”
在1958年的医学伦理和法律教材上，另一位名医写道 ， “ 隐瞒一些情况在临床上常常能收获奇效并且符合患者的利益 。 ”	In a 1958 textbook on medical ethics and law, another eminent doctor stated that it is “often clinically wise and in the patient’s interest to withhold certain matters.”
哪个国家可以率先达到这一目标，不仅取决于该国的财政收入多少，而且也取决于是否有克服既得利益的政治意愿。	Which country achieves this goal first will depend not only on revenue, but also on the political will to overcome vested interests.
在由发展经济学家丹尼·罗德瑞克研究的框架中，在“可能进行突破性的〔政策〕改革”的地方，缺乏资本可以成为一个有效的“增长制约 ” 。	In the framework developed by the development economist Dani Rodrik, a shortage of capital can be a binding “growth constraint”: the place where “the biggest bang for the [policy] reform buck can be obtained.”
毕竟，由于有关性别差异的生物依据在过去一直被用来解释女性的从属地位，女性也因此不愿承认任何先天的差异，唯恐这会被当成对她们不利的证据。	After all, because biology-based arguments about gender difference have historically been used to justify women’s subjugation, women have been reluctant to concede any innate difference, lest it be used against them.
事实上，太多人毫无团结意识的现状 — — 正如关于美国医疗保险体系的辩论 — — 正腐蚀着一个现代民主社会的最核心基础。	Indeed, the utter lack of a sense of solidarity among so many people – horrifyingly evident in the US health-care debate – is now undermining the very basis of what a modern democratic society is.
他还强调可再生能源开发和节能技术创新，在两年前福岛第一核电站事故爆发后，这已经成为紧迫的政策目标之一。	He is also emphasizing the development of renewable energy and power-saving innovations, which became an urgent policy objective following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant two years ago.
如果考虑减少温室气体排放或适应气候变化问题，则每年的基础设施需求成本还要在增加1,700—2,200亿美元。	Factoring in additional spending for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions or adapting to climate change could add $170-220 billion each year to the cost of these countries’ infrastructure needs.
社会民主党(SPD)和基督教社会党(CDU)都坚定不移地坚持“社会市场经济 ” ， 坚持社团主义经济管理的原则，坚持维护福利国家的权利，也都坚持对欧盟和北约的承诺。	The Social Democrats (SPD) and the Christian Democrats (CDU) are both committed to the “social market economy,” to the essentials of corporatist economic management, to maintaining the entitlements of the welfare state, and to the EU and NATO.
美欧与伊朗的外交接触受人欢迎；但若外交接触无法令伊朗就不将核能用于军事目的作出承诺，或无法使伊朗同意就此承诺的履行状况接受严格监督的话，情况又会变成什么样呢？	American and European diplomatic engagement with Iran is welcome. But what happens if this brings either no Iranian commitment to refrain from weaponizing nuclear power, or no acceptance of tough monitoring of such a pledge?
但当有人提醒我们别人在决定我们的生活时，我们又变得异常愤怒，称之为“令人毛骨悚然”并违反我们的自由意志。	But, when reminded of how others are shaping our lives, we become indignant, calling it “creepy” and a violation of our free will.
在传统并信奉宗教的社会中新兴的女权主义核心理论与西方的女权主义差别很大 — — 从某种角度来讲前者的人性化和深刻程度远远超过了后者。	The core theory with which emerging feminists in more traditional and religious societies are working is far different from that of Western feminism – and in some ways far more profound and humane.
这将是一种耻辱，因为上述物质都是被广泛应用的高效除草剂，而当国际癌症研究机构得出结论时，并没有考虑到相关物质在现实世界中是否真有致癌可能。	This would be a shame, because these are highly effective and widely used herbicides, and when the IARC makes its decisions, it does not consider whether the substance in question is actually likely to cause cancer in the real world.
世界各地的一些创业公司如Hakia公司、认知搜索公司、 Lexxe公司 等，已经在挑战这项艰巨的任务了。	Several start-up companies around the world, like Hakia , Cognition Search , and Lexxe , have taken on this challenge.
相反，中国实现了经济分散化，但保留了中央政治集权，经济管理责任大体上被下放到省级，而这导致了中国自身的失衡问题。	By contrast, China achieved economic decentralization, but preserved centralized political power, transferring economic-management responsibilities largely to provincial officials, which has created its own imbalances.
在全球领导人准备齐聚巴黎联合国气候变化会议之际，巴基斯坦正在大洪灾过后的一地狼藉中挣扎。 洪水摧毁了房屋，毁灭了庄稼，冲垮了大桥，还夺走238人的生命。	As world leaders prepare to meet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, the country is reeling from the aftereffects of devastating floods that damaged buildings, destroyed crops, swept away bridges, and killed 238 people.
但是代替美军的联合国部队装备不佳，指挥混乱，结果当剩下的美军试图把该为巴基斯坦维和部队成员死亡负责的索马里军阀绳之以法的时候，他们遭受了攻击。	But ill-equipped and poorly led UN replacement forces for the American presence put the remaining US troops in the bull’s eye as they attempted to bring to justice the Somali warlord responsible for the death of Pakistani peacekeepers.
但其最危险的赤字存在于治理之中。 中国也是如此，薄熙来丑闻便暴露了中国自我标榜的技术专家治国论背后的问题。	But its most damaging deficit is to be found in governance, as is true of China, where the Bo Xilai scandal has exposed the pathological underside of China’s vaunted technocratic leadership.
促进多样性 — — 不仅是性别多样性，在许多国家还包括年龄和种族多样性 — — 既事关效率，也事关社会公正。	Promoting diversity – not only in terms of gender, but also with respect to age and, in many countries, ethnic background – is a matter of effectiveness as much as a question of social justice.
但是，乌克兰危机并没有妨碍不断增加的信心和冷静，而是成了一剂催化剂，促进了西欧内部的政治合作与团结。	Yet, rather than disrupt its growing confidence and composure, the Ukrainian crisis has been a catalyst for renewed political cooperation and solidarity within Western Europe.
但国会并未批准将雇主工资税削减50 % — —类似的削减营业税措施过去曾经受到共和党人的青睐，并在预算效益排行榜上排名居前。	But Congress failed to approve a 50% cut in employers’ payroll taxes – a business tax cut that many Republicans favored in the past and that ranks high on budgetary effectiveness.
中国相信它已经找到了它自己发展和现代化的模式，而它的统治者像纳粹和勃列日涅夫一样，也把奥运会当成将他们的模式“兜售”给全球观众的途径。	China believes that it has found its own model to develop and modernize, and its rulers regard the Games in the same way as the Nazis and Leonid Brezhnev did, as a means of “selling” their model to a global audience.
这个国家刚用高效现代的家用冰箱替换了850,000台低效冰箱，今后几年还将有几百万台冰箱按计划完成换代工作。	And it has just retired 850,000 inefficient household refrigerators in favor of modern, energy-efficient models, with millions more earmarked over the coming years.
建立在这样一个核心周围的欧洲符合我所说的“土星模式 ” ， 在这个模式中，在中间是一个巨大的行星，周围被环形环绕着，它们迟早会合而为一。	A Europe built around such a core corresponds to what I call a “Saturn model,” with a huge planet in the middle, surrounded by rings, converging sooner or later in the center.
可惜，对于这需要什么，人们还没有形成共识，而即使在存在一些一致意见的地方，也缺乏做出必要的军事和经济资源承诺的意愿。	Alas, there is no consensus on what this would require, and even where some agreement exists, sufficient will to commit the required military and economic resources does not.
这个理念在小布什执政后期已经提出，目的是为了和某些东盟成员国构建联系 — — 比如新加坡，越南和文莱 — — 同时也涵盖其他太平洋国家。	This was proposed late in the Bush administration in order to forge links with some ASEAN members – Singapore, Vietnam, and Brunei – as well as others across the Pacific.
伊朗早就明确地表示它希望重新获得作为地区 — — 事实上是全球 — — 主要大国的历史低位，而在看到土耳其地缘政治地位上升后，伊朗的这一雄心越发高涨了。	Iran has long made clear that it wants to resume its historic position as a major regional – and indeed global – power, an ambition that can only grow stronger as it watches Turkey’s geopolitical stature rise.
所幸的是，禁止同性性交的法律在印度并未得到执行，但却成为对同性恋者进行讹诈和骚扰的工具，并使得对人们进行HIV和艾滋病教育的组织难以开展工作。	Fortunately, the prohibition of sodomy in India is not enforced. Yet it provides a basis for blackmail and harassment of homosexuals, and has made it more difficult for groups that educate people about HIV and AIDS to carry out their work.
（当然，拜（比如）非理性繁荣、价值投资者所带来的暂时性下跌或时机不当的逆向投资交易所赐，市场路径是波折的。 ）	(Of course, markets take detours along the way, driven by, say, irrational exuberance, temporary declines in the impact of value investors, or mistimed contrarian trades.)
在喀麦隆，不少我们的组织与世界海关组织一道，帮助海关当局减少了腐败、增加了收入，据估算，每年可以增收2500万美元。	In Cameroon, some of our organizations have worked with the World Customs Organization to help the customs authority reduce corruption and increase collection of revenues – estimated to be more than $25 million a year.
第二个目标是就2015年各国做出国家承诺的条款达成一致 — — 正式的名称叫做“国家自定贡献预案 ” （ INDC ） 。	The second goal was to agree on the terms under which countries will devise their national commitments – officially, their “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDCs) – in 2015.
我曾在1979年柬埔寨边境上第一次描写维瑟尔，他那熟悉而略显凌乱的头发就像乌黑的机翼悬在瘦削、帅气的头颅上空。	I picture Wiesel in 1979 on the Cambodian border, where I met him for the first time, his familiar mop of hair a jet-black wing hovering over his lean, handsome head.
首先，巴塞尔III全球银行改革方案和相应的欧盟资本要求指引第四版（Capital Requirements Directive IV）规则给跨境融资造成了反向激励。	For starters, the Basel III package of global banking reforms and the European Union’s corresponding Capital Requirements Directive IV rule create disincentives for cross-border financing.
中国拉拢韩国是其长期战略的一部分 — — 让韩国沦为外交和国家安全政策的附庸国（正如冷战期间芬兰对苏联的俯首帖耳 ） 。	China’s embrace of South Korea is part of a long-term strategy to turn it into a subordinate state in terms of foreign and national security policy (much as Finland kowtowed to the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War).
生物技术加碳捕捉和储存（BECCS）是净零排放这一“过头方针 ” （ overshoot approach）的榜样。	Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage is the poster child for the new “overshoot approach” of net-zero emissions.
恰恰是认为乌克兰可以像二十五年前的波兰那样接受经济“休克疗法”这类的决策导致了2008年的全球经济危机。	The idea that Ukraine can embrace the economic “shock therapy” that Poland pursued a quarter-century ago is the type of cookie-cutter policymaking that resulted in the 2008 global financial crisis.
在我在英国政府任职的短暂时期，我协助时任财政大臣的乔治·奥斯本（George Osborne）说服卡梅伦应该在十年内使中国成为第三大出口市场。	During my brief spell in the British government, I helped then-Chancellor George Osborne persuade Cameron that we should aspire to make China our third-largest export market within a decade.
为了形象化的表现这种差距，我为我的教育慈善机构清醒基金制定了一项新的综合统计指标，称为2050年清醒指数。	To map this distinction, I have developed a new composite statistical indicator for my educational charity, the Wake Up Foundation, called the Wake Up 2050 Index.
检测“引力子 ” — —形成部分引力场的假象粒子 — — 需要银河系那么大的粒子对撞机或质量与木星相当的检测器。	"Detecting a “graviton"" – the hypothetical particle making up part of a gravitational field – would require a particle collider the size of the Milky Way or a detector with a mass of the planet Jupiter."
一年后，检查表明这头牛的大脑被大量小液泡腐蚀，形成海绵状的形态，于是这种病的学名被称为牛海绵状脑病。	The following year, tests revealed that the brain had been eroded by a myriad of small vacuoles, producing the sponge-like appearance that inspired the disease’s scientific name: bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
随着不平等性日益根深蒂固，有利于促增长的经济政策的共识可能受到影响，从而破坏社会凝聚，刺激政治动荡。	As inequality becomes increasingly entrenched, it can erode the consensus in favor of pro-growth economic policies, undermine social cohesion, and spur political instability.
基础设施委员会将在美国两大党之间分割责任，其委员可以因此摆脱日常政治的压力，集中精力关注经济的健康。	By splitting the responsibility between the country’s two main parties, the commission would free its members from the pressures of day-to-day politics and allow them to concentrate on the health of the economy.
“想象一个倒置的金字塔 ， ” ���资银行家查尔斯·莫里斯写道 ， “ 堆积在实际产量上的要求越多，金字塔变得越不稳定 。 ”	“Think of an inverted pyramid,” writes investment banker Charles Morris. “The more claims are piled on top of real output, the more wobbly the pyramid becomes.”
西方观察家和国内大部分自由主义者并没有放弃埃尔多安，直到其政府2013年夏对伊斯坦布尔加济公园的示威活动采取严厉镇压的举措。	Western observers and the bulk of domestic liberals did not give up on Erdoğan until his government’s heavy-handed tactics during the Gezi Park protests in Istanbul in the summer of 2013.
去年7月，联合国大会一致通过了一项由不丹提出的决议，承认人类根本目标在于追求幸福，而国内生产总值不能体现这一目标。	Last July, the UN General Assembly passed, without dissent, a Bhutanese-initiated resolution recognizing the pursuit of happiness as a fundamental human goal and noting that this goal is not reflected in GDP.
如同欧洲的新排放交易制度一样，全球的生产者和消费者都需要面对市场激励机制采用减缓（并最终停止）增加大气中温室气体的技术和消费模式。	As with Europe’s new carbon trading, all producers and consumers around the globe will need to face market incentives to adopt technologies and consumption patterns that slow (and eventually stop) the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
所有发达国家中的股东在1945年至1975年和1980年期间没有什么组织并且并不积极。 在过去二十多年，他们以养老基金、投资基金以及对冲基金的形式重新确立自己。	For more than two decades, shareholders in all the developed countries, unorganized and passive from 1945 until 1975-1980, have recast themselves in the form of pension funds, investment funds, and hedge funds.
在发行后备资金之时，银行将支付比长期债券更高的利率，因为债权人将承担发行资本的成本，而不是政府来承担救助费用。	In issuing contingent capital, banks would have to pay a higher interest rate than they would on ordinary long-term debt, because debt investors will face the true cost of capital, not the government-subsidized cost.
印度与恐怖主义的斗争史比其他任何一个国家都要长，但如今这一问题影响着整个地区，包括阿富汗、中国和巴基斯坦。	While India has fought terrorism longer than any other country, the problem now affects the entire region, including Afghanistan, China, and Pakistan.
但如今市值最大的四家美国公司 — — 苹果、谷歌，微软和亚马逊 — — 都是科技企业（截至撰写本文时伯克希尔哈撒韦公司超越脸书排到了第五位 ） 。	But now, the four largest US firms by market capitalization – Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon – are all tech companies (as of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway had edged out Facebook for fifth place).
随着流动性越来越强，逐渐老龄化的欧洲迫切需要令它恐惧不已的移民的注入 — — 不仅如此，它还应该在移民抵达之后很快（比如一年时间内）将当地政治问题上的发言权交到他们手中。	In a world of increasing mobility, an aging Europe will badly need the immigrants of whom it is so frightened – and it should give them a voice in local politics soon (say, one year) after they arrive.
如今，普京又声称有权利忽视邻国的主权，而原因仅仅是俄罗斯要捍卫海外俄罗斯族的权利，包括他们脱离所在国家加入俄罗斯祖国的权利。	Now Putin claims the right to ignore neighboring countries’ sovereignty on the pretext that Russia is merely defending the rights of ethnic Russians abroad, up to and including their right to secede and join the Russian homeland.
传统上，扩张被视为比常规欧盟条约更能超越国家利益的领域：入盟程序的常规内容要求决策方式更加社会导向。	Enlargement was traditionally viewed as an area where national interests would be more readily set aside than in conventional EU settings: the normative dimension of the process seemed to demand a more community-oriented approach to decision-making.
研究表明在经营性资产领域授予妇女更多的决策权有可能提高农业产量超过20 % ， 这对到2030年“消除一切形式的贫困 ” （ 可持续发展目标第1条）将起到至关重要的作用。	Studies show that giving women more decision-making power over productive assets has the potential to increase farm yields by more than 20%, which is essential to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere” by 2030 (SDG 1).
1993—1994年，格林斯潘再一次勒紧货币政策，结果人们惊讶地发现，小规模紧缩可以给长期资产价格和公司借贷成本带来如此大的影响。	Between 1993 and 1994, Greenspan once again reined in monetary policy, only to be surprised by the impact that small amounts of tightening could have on the prices of long-term assets and companies’ borrowing costs.
创伤专家保罗·史蒂文森（Paul Stevenson）描述了一种沮丧症候，这是他在位于澳大利亚海域的瑙鲁难民羁押营所观察到的。	The trauma specialist Paul Stevenson described a demoralization syndrome that he observed during his work at migrant detention centers on Nauru, off the Australian coast.
与石油出口不同（石油出口收入被欠中国和其他国家的巨额债务占用 ） ， 非法毒品出口的收入天然不会被占用（除了及其偶尔发生的没收之外 ） 。	And, unlike oil exports, which are encumbered by massive debts to China and others, the proceeds from the illegal drug exports are by nature unencumbered, except in rare instances of seizure.
长期以来，悲观论者总是把中国经济与本国经济作比较 — — 重复着耶鲁大学历史学家史景迁（Jonathan Spence）的著名观点在多年前就发出警告的典型错误。	Pessimists have long viewed the Chinese economy as they view their own economies – repeating a classic mistake that Yale historian Jonathan Spence’s seminal assessment warned of many years ago.
他们的论据是，如果你允许政府禁止你所讨厌或鄙视的观点，你就削弱了你自己挑战针对你所同意的观点的类似禁令的权利。	Their argument was that if you allow the government to ban opinions you hate or despise, you weaken your right to contest a similar ban on views with which you might agree.
渴望皇冠的普京忘记了俄罗斯君主固然表面光鲜，始终危机四伏，因为独裁对法律的蔑视让他很容易遭遇暴民正义。	Pining for a crown, Putin forgets that Russian monarchy, for all its splendor, was always a minefield, because an autocrat’s contempt for law leaves him vulnerable to mob justice.
在确定2016年的“八大任务”中，李克强将供给侧改革排在第二 — — 仅次于应对增长放缓的经济稳定政策。	In identifying the top “eight tasks” for 2016, Li put supply-side reforms at number two – second only to the government’s focus on economic stability in countering China’s growth slowdown.
我们也许会悲叹通过“外包”而失去的制造业岗位，但是我们肯定不会为我们出口到中国的巨量污染物感到悲叹。	While we may lament the loss of manufacturing jobs through “outsourcing,” we certainly do not lament exporting massive amounts of pollution to China.
目前的情况是，反欧盟政党热烈地响应俄罗斯总统普京及其相当反自由的经济和社会政策，这也许是唯一有利于老牌政治家庭的动向。	As it stands, the anti-EU parties’ enthusiastic embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with his profoundly anti-liberal economic and social policies, may well be the only thing working in the established political families’ favor.
利比亚正经历着一场你死我活的斗争，一边是坚持追求变革的人民，另一边则是在实施了40年暴政后依然负隅顽抗的贪婪政权。	Libya is experiencing a deadly struggle between people insisting on change, and a desperate, greedy regime determined to cling to power after 40 years of crass misrule.
可怜的难民家庭在贪婪的走私者和歹徒支配下在海上漂流的图片很容易激发怜悯和同情（而且不只是在德国 ） 。	Images of miserable refugee families drifting in the sea, at the mercy of rapacious smugglers and gangsters, can easily inspire feelings of pity and compassion (and not just in Germany).
面对着费卢杰或纳杰夫城所看到的严重暴力，没有一部强加的宪法能够对联军有所帮助，不管它看上去多么正义凛然。	No imposed constitution, however elegant it may be, will be very helpful to Coalition forces when confronted with the type of mayhem seen in towns like Fallujah or Najjaf.
对于担心更大程度地依赖私人资金会导致曲目编排保守的人士而言，旧金山交响乐团是演奏曲目最富冒险精神的美国乐团之一的事实，也可以使他们放心了。	It also should be reassuring to Europeans who are concerned that greater reliance on private money necessarily means conservative programming that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most adventuresome repertoires in the US.
然而只有少数观察人士敢于指出，这种快速逆转其实是由那些流动性过剩的全球资本主义核心地区孕育的套利交易操作推动下的信贷泡沫的结果。	Only a few observers dared to point out that this rapid reversal was the result of credit bubbles fueled by carry-trade operations hatched in overly liquid centers of global capitalism.
与此形成鲜明对比的是，2012年希腊债务减记 — — 作为计划失败的结果发生 — — 只是让下降螺旋继续维持下去。	In sharp contrast, a debt write-down like Greece’s in 2012, which resulted from a program’s failure, only contributes to maintaining the downward spiral.
但这种摇摆确实是过度了 — — 不是所有逐利的发达国家投资者都会对发展中国家背后的增长动力了如指掌。	But the swing is excessive. Not all advanced-economy investors who were chasing yield have deep knowledge of developing-country growth dynamics.
少数观察家怀疑中国将在未来十年中的某个时间点被迫随人民币汇率自由浮动，问题则是在这一过渡期间会因为政治和经济规则发生冲突而产生多少乱象。	Few observers doubt that China will have to let the renminbi exchange rate float freely sometime over the next decade. The question is how much drama will take place in the interim, as political and economic imperatives collide.
而短短几个月后，英国脱欧和特朗普当选总统就被人们普遍视为早在数十年前就已经有人预测到的反精英反全球化浪潮不可避免的产物。	A few months later, Brexit and the Trump presidency were universally acknowledged as the inevitable consequence of an anti-elitist, anti-globalization backlash that was predictable decades ago.
又比如，时至年末，31岁的库尔兹凭借将保守的奥地利人民党（ÖVP）改造为所谓的“塞巴斯蒂安·库尔兹名单—新人民党”而当选奥地利总理。	Or consider how, at the end of the year, 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz became Chancellor of Austria after refashioning the conservative Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) into a movement called “The Sebastian Kurz list – The New People’s Party.”
在这种困境中催生出一种流行理念：债券市场实际上欢迎更少的财政紧缩，因为这样才能促进经济增长，从而使公共债务水平在长期上显得更可持续。	From this predicament stems the fashionable idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal austerity, because this would boost economic growth, in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run.
相反，监督委员会最近批准了一项新财政计划，并与波多黎各紧急利息基金公司（COFINA）所发债券的持有人签订了协议，有可能让波多黎各永远被债务所紧紧束缚。	On the contrary, the oversight board recently certified a new fiscal plan and a deal with holders of bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Urgent Interest Fund Corporation (COFINA) that could put the island in a debt straitjacket indefinitely.
诚然，贸易应该惠及所有国家、所有人，不管是欧洲和美国因为工厂关闭而受到损失的工人，还是陷在非洲和南非非正式经济中的自给农民（subsistence farmers ） 。	To be sure, trade must deliver for all countries and for all people, from factory workers suffering plant closures in Europe or the United States to subsistence farmers trapped in informal economies in Africa and South Asia.
伊朗支持过麦加的暴乱朝圣者、黎巴嫩自杀式炸弹袭击者和真主党游击队，后者不久前袭击过以色列，并曾在最近与沙特支持的叙利亚叛乱团体作战。	The non-state actors Iran has supported include rioting pilgrims in Mecca, suicide bombers in Lebanon, and Hezbollah militants, who have launched attacks on Israel and, more recently, battled Saudi-backed rebel groups in Syria.
华沙—在过去60年中，欧洲一体化工程面临着诸多挑战：战后经济困境、共产主义的严重束缚、后冷战时代的不确定性。	WARSAW – Over the past 60 years, the project of European integration has confronted many challenges: post-war economic hardships, the heavy yoke of communism, and the uncertain footing of the post-Cold War world.
对于不是那么贵的鞋子，由于投入到生产过程中无形的部分的资金比较少，这个数字不是那么高，但是仍然超过了50 % 。	For less expensive shoes, with lower sums invested in the intangible parts of the production process, this figure was not as high, but still more than 50%.
多数人眼中更好的教育是接受更多教育；而更高质量教育是指有效地学会技能（比方说像经合组织标准化PISA考试成绩 ） 。	What most people mean by better education is more schooling; and, by higher-quality education, they mean the effective acquisition of skills (as revealed, say, by the test scores in the OECD’s standardized PISA exam).
脊髓灰质炎公共卫生紧急状况持续不断正在危及全球根除脊髓灰质炎行动（GPEI）的成功，自1988年启动以来，世界各国已累计投入150亿美元用于这项行动；同时还威胁到全球公共卫生。	The continuing polio PHEIC is endangering the success of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), into which the world has invested $15 billion since it was launched in 1988; and it threatens global health generally.
不久之后，在美国的要求之下，泛美开发银行及其成员没有按原计划发放贷款，而是采取了从没采取过的措施，在发放这些资金之前暗示增加海地采取政治行动的条件。	Soon after, at the behest of the US, instead of disbursing the loans as planned, the IDB and its members took the unprecedented step of implicitly adding conditions to require political action by Haiti before the funds would be released.
除非欧洲的政治权力也得到欧洲化，让现在的联合体进化为联邦，否则欧元区 — — 以及整个欧盟 — — 将分崩离析。	Unless political power in Europe is Europeanized, with the current confederation evolving into a federation, the eurozone – and the EU as a whole – will disintegrate.
对多元文化主义的暧昧态度使得荷兰籍摩洛哥人长久固守着保守作风，也让荷兰籍土耳其人一直避开公众的视线。	Non-committal multiculturalism has long kept the conservatism of Dutch Moroccans and Dutch Turks hidden from the public eye.
其中的逻辑看上去无懈可击，诚然，世界上400,000种植物中的绝大部分含有保护自己免遭放牧牲畜吞噬的化学防御（有毒 ） 。	The logic seems impeccable, and it is true that the vast majority of the planet’s 400,000 plant species do contain chemical defenses (poisons) to defend themselves from grazing herbivores.
中国的许多公用事业机构 — — 如航空、铁路、港口和通讯等 — — 都是单一产品实体，由国有企业负责经营管理。	Many public utilities in China – such as airlines, railways, ports, and telecommunications – are single-product entities administered by state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
"根据""摩尔定律 "" - 由英特尔的前总裁在1975年阐明，并以其名字命名-计算机芯片上的元件数量每两年就要翻一番。"	"According to ""Moore's Law"" -- named after the president of Intel, who formulated it in 1975 -- the amount of components on a computer chip doubles every two years."
但是，如果央行能够在足够长的时间里遏制国内和全球性矛盾，那么内生恢复和最终的政治进步将大大改善概率分布。	If, however, central banks can contain domestic and global inconsistencies long enough, the combination of endogenous healing and eventual political progress would significantly improve the probability distribution.
老牌的跨国企业和它们的源起国需要为迎接新势力的挑战作出调整，还要适应这些新贵企业为世界市场带来的变化。	Established TNC’s, and their home countries, will need to adjust to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the world market.
奥巴马的连任给出了一个信号，一个只有在言论不脱离实际的情况下才会引起广泛共鸣（包括在过美国国内）的信号，这在奥巴马的第一个任期中屡试不爽。	Obama’s reelection sends a message, but one that will resonate widely – including at home – only if rhetoric does not depart from reality, as was too often the case during Obama’s first term.
莫迪去年就任总理时，他和他的印度人民党（BJP）突然认识到了商品和服务税的好处，开始大张旗鼓地宣传这项法案，但也不乏重要的修订之处。	When Modi became Prime Minister last year, he and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suddenly recognized the virtues of a GST, embracing the bill with great fanfare, but also with important amendments.
对一个经济成功基于技术创新的国家来说，目前基础研究投资占GDP之比还不如半个世纪前，这简直令人震惊。	Shockingly for a country whose economic success is based on technological innovation, the GDP share of investment in basic research is lower today than it was a half-century ago.
作为世界第六大经济体、拥有4,000万人口、堪称美国未来的化身、由团结负责的民主党政府执政的加利福尼亚州是进步联邦主义能够取得什么成就的榜样。	With the world’s sixth-largest economy, a population of nearly 40 million that looks like the future of America, and a united and responsible Democratic government, California is a model of what progressive federalism can accomplish.
外围国主权债务名义利率仍然非常低，而即使将极低的通胀预期（甚至通缩预期）考虑在内，实际利率仍然很低。	Nominal interest rates for periphery countries’ sovereign debt have remained extremely low, and, even when taking into account expectations of very low inflation (or even deflation), real interest rates are low.
摩根大通的CEO詹姆斯·戴蒙（James Dimon）今年早些时候由于轻率冒险导致将近60亿美元的巨亏（也许可以把那称为“三个郭儒博”的大失败 ） ， 可他的工作显然还比较稳固。	Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, presided this year over reckless risk-taking to the tune of nearly $6 billion (we might call it a “three Grübel” debacle), yet his job apparently remains secure.
于是，核军备竞赛开始了。 1960年，美国总统肯尼迪警告说，到20世纪60年代中期将由15、20乃至25个有核国家。	So the nuclear arms race began, and in 1960 President John F. Kennedy warned that there would be 15, 20, or 25 nuclear states by the mid-1960s.
但莫拉莱斯之所以能够成为融合这三大标志领域的领袖确乎反映了这样一个事实：20世纪90年代的机构改革扩大了社会参与基础，为新兴领导人和政治运动带来了发展机遇。	But the making of Morales as a leader able to combine these three dimensions reflects two institutional reforms in the 1990’s that expanded social participation and opened up opportunities for new leaders and political movements.
德国经济从1995年到2005年只增长14 ％ ， 成为意大利之后的欧洲“第二落后者 ” 。 法国经济则增长23.6 ％ ， 接近老欧盟国家平均水平24.3 ％ 。	While Germany grew by only 14% in the ten years from 1995 to 2005, ranking as Europe’s “vice-laggard” next to Italy, France grew by 23.6%, which was nearly the old EU countries’ average of 24.3%.
这只能让民粹主义者有效地散布“看，精英真的讨厌你，我们早就说了。 并且现在他们是糟糕的输家”这样的话，从而得到更高的政治分数。	This only allows populists to score more political points by saying, in effect: “See, elites really do hate you, just as we said, and now they are bad losers.”
尽管具体的代际界限划分或多或少带有任意性，但它们反映了一个重要趋势：军事前线和民用后方分界日益模糊。	While particular generational delineations are somewhat arbitrary, they reflect an important trend: the blurring of the military front and the civilian rear.
在美国以及其他地方，民选政府通常都会照顾好自己的人民，但如今，就跟那些背着顾客密谋打压“不守规矩”新竞争者的企业一样，政府自己都变成了一个独立的利益集团。	In the United States and elsewhere, elected governments used to take care of the people, but now, like companies colluding against their customers to keep out disruptive newcomers, they have become a separate interest group.
由于让借款人避免违约 — — 至少暂时避免 — — 的唯一办法是提供不断增加的流动性，因此，即使银行面临流动性约束，也仍然愿意扩大新贷款。	Given that the only way to enable borrowers to avoid default – at least temporarily – has been to provide an ever-increasing amount of liquidity, even banks facing liquidity constraints have remained willing to extend new loans.
北欧国家是实验新方法提供公共服务、同时采取劳动力关系上的“弹性保障 ” （ flexicurity）的先锋。	The Nordic countries have led the way in experimenting with new ways to deliver public services while adopting “flexicurity” in labor relations.
因此，穆迪已将意大利的主权信用评级下调到只比垃圾级别高一级的水平，理由是对该国的债务存量以及政府过度乐观的增长预测表示担忧。	As a result, Moody’s has since downgraded Italy’s sovereign credit rating to just one notch above junk level, citing worries about the country’s debt stock and the government’s overoptimistic growth projections.
美国和西方很多人将鲁哈尼视为伊斯兰共和国的温和派，因为艾哈迈迪内贾德更加激进而把他视作伊朗人的本来面目。	In America and the West, many will probably regard Rowhani as the friendly face of the Islamic Republic, whereas Ahmadinejad was its true – because more radical – embodiment.
偷猎者往往通过向买家展示犀牛角是从头骨上直接取下来的来证明其非法产品的真实性，而这种取角方式会直接导致犀牛死亡。	Poachers often prove the veracity of their illicit product by showing buyers horns that have been removed from the base of the skull, an extraction method that kills the animal.
采用最佳的施工方法可以释放出巨额价值：目前的状况是，类似项目的标价在不同国家可以相差50%到100%之多。	Meeting best practices could unlock huge value: as it stands, the price tags for similar projects can vary by 50-100% from country to country.
在第一种方法中，养鱼场将从海洋转移到循环水产养殖系统（RAS）中，鱼类生活在通过水泵、加热装置、通风装置和过滤装置管理的室内水箱。	In the first approach, fish farms would be moved from the ocean to recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), in which fish are housed in indoor tanks that are regulated by pumps, heaters, aerators, and filters.
第一种可能是第一部长萨尔蒙德（Alex Salmond）所构想的，即成立一个货币联盟，其中的央行同时对苏格兰和没有了苏格兰的英国负责。	The first possibility, which First Minister Alex Salmond appears to have in mind, would entail a monetary union under a central bank accountable both to Scotland and the rump UK.
世界银行估算，今年世界侨汇总额将达到5,860亿美元，对于与银行竞争资金转移业务的公司来说，光是侨汇便已是一个巨大的增长机会。	Migrants’ remittances alone, which the World Bank estimates will total $586 billion this year, represent a tremendous growth opportunity for companies competing with banks to move money.
作为坎特伯雷大主教居间调停的和平协议的一部分，国王接受了贵族的要求，即一份被称为Magna Carta或曰“大宪章”的文件。	As part of a peace deal brokered by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the king accepted the baron’s demands, put to him in a document called Magna Carta, or “the Great Charter.”
在犹太人和以色列的问题上，他很有可能言行一致，但是，他果真就是后世的希特勒、而今天的伊朗就是三十年代的德国吗？	He very probably means what he says about Jews and Israel, but is he a latter-day Hitler, and is today’s Iran the equivalent of Germany in the 1930’s?
毕竟，朝鲜领导人从中国的成功案例中习得的主要经验便是：安全问题（毛泽东与美国恢复邦交之举）先于经济转型（邓小平的改革开放政策 ） 。	After all, the main lesson that North Korean leaders take from China’s success is that security (Mao Zedong’s rapprochement with the US) precedes economic transition (Deng Xiaoping’s reform and opening policy).
换言之，在过去的30年里，富国似乎已经实现了“可持续发展 ” ， 而穷国（除中国外）的经济发展却是不可持续的。	In other words, during the past three decades the rich world seems to have enjoyed “sustainable development,” while development in the poor world (barring China) has been unsustainable.
相反地，中国人民银行正在进行更为先发制人的打击 — — 试图通过减少过度杠杆来保证稳定，但一直以来都支持着越发以来信贷的中国实体经济都是依靠这些杠杆支撑着的。	Conversely, the PBOC is engaged in a more pre-emptive strike – attempting to ensure stability by reducing the excess leverage that has long underpinned the real side of an increasingly credit-dependent Chinese economy.
令人震惊的是，当其总理内塔尼亚胡本月早些时候在美国国会发表演讲时，他39分钟时间大谈伊朗对以色列造成的生存威胁，根本没有提到巴勒斯坦人民。	Astonishingly, when Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu addressed the United States Congress earlier this month, his 39-minute speech about Iran’s existential threat to Israel did not contain a single mention of the Palestinian people.
对此有一种解决方案正日渐流行，而且听上去似乎也合情合理，那就是全世界必须大幅削减每天的温室气体排放量。	One prescription that is bandied about with increasing frequency certainly sounds sensible: the world should drastically cut the amount of greenhouse gases that it pumps into the atmosphere each day.
任何想将原来生产食品的土地用于生产生物燃料的人都必须认识到这样做会提升食品价格，从而伤害最最贫困的那些人。	Whoever wishes to grow bio-fuels on land that was previously used for food production must recognize that this would increase food prices, harming the poorest of the poor.
比如，2003—2011年，土耳其的资本流入增加值接近GDP的8 % ， 这部分解释了70%的美元价格增幅。	For example, from 2003 to 2011, Turkey’s inflows increased by almost 8% of GDP, which partly explains the 70% increase in prices measured in dollars.
总统巴拉克·奥巴马、副总统乔·拜登和希拉里·克林顿本人都是尊严的典范，与特朗普墨索里尼似的举止和言语攻击有着很大的不同。	President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton herself were paragons of dignity, compared to Trump’s Mussolini-like mannerisms and verbal aggression.
然而对此的执法不力令国内企业在很大程度上忽视了这些成本，到了2008年当局开始大力纠察缴费率，让企业倍感压力。	Yet weak enforcement long meant that domestic firms largely ignored those costs. Then, in 2008, the authorities began to enforce the contribution rate vigorously, which squeezed firms.
因为其劳动力市场的弹性，较高的教育水平，政治稳定以及对创新的接受能力，世界经济论坛仍然将美国经济评为世界上最有竞争力的经济体。	The World Economic Forum still rates the American economy as the world’s most competitive, owing to its labor-market flexibility, higher education, political stability, and openness to innovation.
正常人经常都需要并应该得到帮助，但提供何种帮助不应该基于将他们的状况定义为精神障碍的错误决定，以及因此导致的错误处理。	Normal individuals often need and deserve help, but the decision as to the kind of help they get should not be biased by incorrect labeling of their conditions as mental disorders that suggest something is internally wrong with them.
国际货币基金组织去年所建立的多边监管机制是朝正确方向所迈出的一个步骤，但是只有成立了一个实施多边监管机制和政策协调的组织，它们才能发挥作用。	The multilateral surveillance mechanisms launched last year by the IMF are a step in the right direction, but only if they become part of an institutionalized multilateral mechanism of surveillance and policy coordination.
电脑屏幕上的画面是令人震惊的：一个男人，躺在医院的病床上，他的头上绑着绷带，血不断地从他的头顶上淌下来。	The image on the computer screen is shocking: a man, lying on a hospital bed, his head bandaged, with long trickles of blood running from the top of his scalp.
当政府将税收资金用于普及公共教育和医疗保健时，许多人不会将其视之为再分配行为，因为服务是向所有人提供的，而接受它们似乎更加爱国行为而不是占了别人的便宜。	When the government spends tax money on universal public education and health care, it does not strike many as redistribution, because the services are offered to everyone, and accepting them appears more patriotic than abject.
今天，抛弃欧元重新引入本国货币至少需要几周时间，而1931年英国利用周末市场不开盘的时间就能让英镑脱离黄金。	Reintroducing national currencies today would take weeks, at a minimum, whereas Britain in 1931 could take sterling off gold while the markets were closed for the weekend.
2008年之前，西班牙经历了大规模的建筑繁荣，其危害性一点都不亚于随之发生的高失业，因为这鼓励了一整代年轻人去从事高薪低能的建筑业工作。	The big pre-2008 construction boom in Spain did as much harm as subsequent high unemployment, because it encouraged a generation of young people to take high-paying, low-skill jobs in the building industry.
欧盟很早就采取了这一治理机制，而即便在东盟内部，也有多数投票决策的先例，特别是在地缘政治和安全问题上。	The European Union embraced this governance mechanism long ago, and even within ASEAN there is precedent for majority-vote decision-making, particularly on geopolitical and security issues.
话虽如此，但仍有达成协议的空间：希腊明确表示愿意继续采取改革措施，也欢迎欧洲帮助其实施部分改革计划。	Having said that, there is room for a deal: Greece has made clear its willingness to engage in continued reforms, and has welcomed Europe’s help in implementing some of them.
放眼全球，每年都有数十亿美元投资被用于解决环境破坏和贫困；17个联合国可持续发展目标中大部分以某种方式与这两个问题有关。	Around the world, billions of dollars are invested annually to address environmental degradation and poverty; many of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals are linked in some way to these two concerns.
十年来，我都在提议，未来的国际货币基金组织应该被看作是一个区域储备基金网络的顶点 — — 也就是说，一个在设计上和欧洲中央银行或者美国联邦储备系统相近的体系。	For a decade, I have proposed that the IMF of the future should be seen as the apex of a network of regional reserve funds – that is, a system closer in design to the European Central Bank or the United States Federal Reserve system.
美国和欧盟却有着不同的想法，他们希望看到民主的转变和把巴尔干半岛的所有国家都融入北约以及最终融入欧盟。	The United States and the European Union are committed to a different vision: democratic transition and integration of all of the Balkans into NATO and eventually the EU.
事实上，当联���存款保险公司和英格兰银行研究其计划之时，美联储正在研究一种在美外资银行处于比当前更牢固掌控和严密监管之下的提案。	Indeed, while the FDIC and the BoE were working on their plan, the US Federal Reserve was developing proposals that will expose overseas banks in the US to a far tighter set of controls, and closer supervision, than they have hitherto experienced.
对于新增长模式的具体内容，人们还有一些分歧，但各种方案之间并无剧烈差异，因为当前模式建立在不可持续的基础之上已成为压倒性共识。	While not everyone agrees on exactly what the new growth model should look like, proposals do not differ drastically, given the prevailing consensus that the current model rests on an unsustainable foundation.
这引发了马拉布、壳牌和尼日利亚政府之间的一系列法律纠纷，最终的结果是2011年腐败的壳牌-埃尼交易。	This triggered a series of legal battles between Malabu, Shell, and the Nigerian government that ended only with the corrupt Shell-Eni deal in 2011.
加州克莱尔蒙特 — — 中国的“太子党 ” ， 那些在教育、就业和商务方面享尽特权的人，正前所未有地经受着外界审视的目光。	CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – China’s “princelings” – the offspring of senior Chinese officials who benefit from lavish privileges in education, employment, and business – are coming under scrutiny as never before.
在许多国家，特殊利益对决策官员有着过度的影响力，监管者也常常通过所作所为应该受其监督的人的眼睛看世界。	Special interests hold undue sway over official decision-makers in many countries, and regulators are always prone to see the world through the eyes of the people whose activities they are supposed to oversee.
在最近的埃博拉危机期间，设备不足的医疗设施反而导致了死亡人数增加，不仅病人遭难，那些致力于帮助他们的医疗工作者也无法幸免。	During the recent Ebola crisis, underequipped facilities caused even more deaths, not just among patients, but also among the health workers committed to helping them.
也应该对这些问题给予关注，但这样的选择 — — 半吊子改革或根本没有改革 — — 只会导致情况进一步恶化。	These are valid concerns, but the alternatives – half measures or no reform at all – would only make a bad situation worse.
但过去30年的研究表明真正的利他行为确实存在，而且可以超越亲属和社区，涵盖人类甚至是其他物种的普遍福祉。	But research over the past 30 years indicates that true altruism does exist and can extend beyond kin and community to encompass the welfare of humans generally – and that of other species.
据最全面的数字媒体消费调查2018年数字新闻报告显示，在消费者信心趋于稳定的同时，订阅量正在呈现出上升的势头。	According to the Digital News Report 2018 – the most comprehensive survey of digital media consumption – subscriptions are trending up while consumer confidence has stabilized.
不但照顾日已老化的人口将变得更加困难；获取足够收入来为社会保障体系提供资金也将随着赡养比的上升而日益艰难。	Not only will finding the staff to care for an aging population become more difficult; obtaining sufficient revenue to fund social security systems will also become harder as the dependency ratio rises.
“自由之屋 ” ， 一个非政府组织，在布什上任之初列出了86个自由国家，而在他执政末期，这一数字略有增加，达到89个。	Freedom House, a non-governmental organization, listed 86 free countries at the beginning of the Bush years, and a slight increase to 89 by the end of his term.
其理念就是想要使金融系统不至于去安全拆解其一手打造的复杂得难以置信的合同网络 — — 而且不得出现系统崩溃的可能性。	The idea was to save the financial system from having to deal with safely dismantling the impossibly complex contractual edifices – which did not allow for the possibility of systemic collapse – that it had constructed.
消费支出的增加和住宅投资升高提振了劳动力需求，因此，4月就业注册人数增加了288,000人，而今年此前的平均月度数字为200,000。	Higher consumer spending and increased residential investment boosted demand for labor, resulting in a rise in payroll employment of 288,000 in April, up from a monthly average of less than 200,000 earlier in the year.
半个世纪后，中亚朝圣者‘阿卜杜勒·拉希德·易卜拉欣描述了圣城的污秽和肮脏，讲述了朝圣者在街上齐踝深的粪水中行走的故事。	A half-century later, the Central Asian pilgrim ‘Abd al-Rashid Ibrahim described the holy city’s filth and squalor, recounting stories of pilgrims walking through streets ankle deep in excrement.
该法律针对有时在国外使用的地理简写法，他们非常反感二战期间纳粹份子在波兰领土上所建灭绝集中营的称谓。	The law targets a geographical shorthand, sometimes used abroad, for the extermination camps that the Nazis established on Polish territory during World War II.
目前，泰国正在专制与民主、过去与未来的夹缝中挣扎 — — 直到漫长的皇室影响过去才有可能改变这种状况。	For now, Thailand is trapped between authoritarianism and democracy, between the past and the future – and will likely remain there, until the long royal twilight has passed.
如果这一趋势在未来几个月中保持下去，家庭很快就会认识到他们的生活水平正在下降，从而必须调整支出习惯。	As this trend continues in the coming months, households will soon realize that their living standards are falling, and they will have to adjust their spending habits.
本月的欧盟理事会将通过解决三个主要问题为CSDP的进一步发展打��基础：运转效率、防务能力和欧洲防务行业的状况。	This month’s Council will lay the foundations for the CSDP’s further development by addressing three main topics: operational efficiency, defense capabilities, and the state of the European defense industry.
这样一来，韩国经济非常容易受制于外部需求的变化 — — 2008年全球经济危机期间这一事实变得尤其显著。	As a result, South Korea’s economy has become highly vulnerable to changes in external demand – a fact that became starkly apparent during the 2008 global economic crisis.
米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）和我却提出了不同的反对意见，认为实行这样的政策必须得有一个持续上涨的通货膨胀率。	In different ways, Milton Friedman and I objected, arguing that such a policy would require an ever-rising inflation rate.
这一灾难 — — 回到自十九世纪末、二十世纪初以来从未再现过的不平等程度 — — 在皮克提的书中做了充分的描述。	That disaster – a return to levels of inequality not seen since the late nineteenth to early twentieth century – is amply described in Piketty’s book.
联合国大会是一次独一无二的机会，全世界领导人应该利用它来构建真正的全球福利 — — 更加健康的人民 — — 通过推动全民覆盖来消灭结核病、治疗NCD和促进更好的精神卫生实现。	The UN General Assembly is a unique opportunity for world leaders to foster a true global good – better health for their citizens – by advancing universal coverage to end TB, beat NCDs, and promote better mental health.
民主国家的政治建制似乎陷入了永久性的迟钝状态，这促使选民要求强势领导人承诺打破政治僵局，扫清官僚主义障碍，采取果断的新政策。	Democratic countries’ political establishments seem to be in a permanent state of torpor, fueling voter demand for strong leaders who promise to smash through political gridlock and sweep away bureaucratic resistance to bold new policies.
一对针对孟加拉穆斯林移民群体的野蛮大屠杀 — — 其中一次于1983年杀害了阿萨姆邦内利村和其他村的约3，000名穆斯林民众，暴露了这次危机已经造成了多么严重的后果。	A pair of savage massacres of Bengali Muslim migrant groups – one of which killed some 3,000 in the Assamese village of Nellie and other villages in 1983 – exposed the depth of the crisis.
在1895年9月的连续十天里，有500多个伦敦人死于霍乱，Snow用城市地图将所有发生霍乱病例的家庭的位置标注出来。	During a ten-day period in September 1854, during which more than 500 Londoners died from the disease, Snow used a city map to mark the location of each household with a case of cholera.
无论如何，TPP的批评者现在应该读一读那些长期以来他们一直说想一睹为快的具体条款，并重新思考对该协议的反对态度。	Regardless, the TPP’s critics should now read the specifics that they have so long said they wanted to see and reconsider their opposition to the deal.
但是，在世界其他地方，其他因素 — — 即源自产能过剩和资产（包括人力）利用率不足的总需求不足和巨大的产出缺口 — — 似乎更加重要。	But, in much of the rest of the world, other factors – namely, inadequate aggregate demand and significant output gaps, rooted in excess capacity and underused assets (including people) – seem more important.
欧元的成功的基石是辛勤的努力和对共同货币独特历史使命的孜孜以求，而且，很重要的一点，是选择了恰当的货币政策策略。	The fundamentals of the euro’s success are hard work, dedicated commitment to the common currency’s unique historical mission, and, not least, a well chosen monetary policy strategy.
由于葡萄牙，希腊和西班牙在经济增长方面的不利前景和脆弱的公共财政，评级机构已经下调了这三个国家的等级。	Rating agencies have downgraded Portugal, Greece, and Spain, owing to their poor prospects for economic growth and weak public finances.
对俄罗斯天然气供应的持续恐慌和不确定无疑会使那些最容易遭遇停气的国家想方设法阻挠欧盟和俄罗斯双方形成新的伙伴关系和合作协议。	Continued fear and uncertainty about Russian gas supplies would undoubtedly lead the most exposed EU countries to seek to protect themselves by blocking EU-Russia negotiations on new partnership and cooperation agreements.
第一，即便特洛芬在这些实验中更有疗效，但这种药只是为了满足美国和欧洲市场的需求，永远不会在非洲销售。	First, even if the trials proved favorable, Trovan was never intended for sale in Africa, but rather for the US and European markets.
但如今，G20需要扩大视野，认识到数字技术所制造的市场结果如果不通过世界竞争网络加以制约，将会一直牺牲工人的利益满足跨国公司的利益。	But the G20 now needs to expand its scope, by recognizing that digital technologies are creating market outcomes that, if unchecked by a new World Competition Network, will continue to favor multinational firms at the expense of workers.
众所周知，除了巨大的财富与其不断创新突破的医药研究之外，美国的医疗体系其实非常糟糕：它异常昂贵，并且花费高得令工作场所健康保险体系都负担不住。	We know that despite its great wealth – and its groundbreaking medical research – America’s health-care system is awful. It is hugely expensive.
近几周的例子让我们没有理由乐观地认为美国议员会摆脱党派之争的束缚，扪心自问怎样做才最符合美国的利益。	The example of recent weeks gives us no cause for optimism that US legislators will rise above partisan politics and ask themselves what is best for America.
有人建议印度在这些人返回孟加拉之前为其设立难民营，因为无法保证那一天将会到来，这样的前景令人权团体倍感恐怖。	Some have suggested that India establish camps to house these people until they can return to Bangladesh – a prospect that horrifies human-rights groups, not least because there is no guarantee that that day will ever come.
但智利政府却受制于剩余资金不足，因为政府将两年前增税带来的可观资金投资于（甚至为高收入学生）提供免费大学教育等考虑不周的政策。	But the Chilean government has little money left, having committed the revenues from a sizeable tax increase two years ago to the ill-conceived policy of free university education, even for high-income students.
首尔—两年来，朝鲜半岛紧张局势不断升级，即将到来的韩国平昌冬奥会有望带来一些缓和，不管多么短暂，都令人期盼。	SEOUL – After some two years of rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the reprieve, however brief, that the upcoming Winter Olympics in the South Korean city of PyeongChang promises to bring is more than welcome.
意大利国债息差开始上升，贝卢斯科尼政府再三收到警示，必须采取财政紧缩计划，欧洲央行也伸出了援手，提供了额外流动性。	Interest spreads for Italian government bonds began to rise, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s administration was alarmed enough to implement an austerity program, and the European Central Bank helped with extra liquidity.
lamp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 印度的德里市正在推出新的生态友好的压缩天然气汽车，它将额外创造18000个新岗位。	·The Indian city of Delhi is introducing new eco-friendly compressed natural gas buses, which will create an additional 18,000 new jobs.
收入从劳动力手中通过再分配流入资本手中，也从边际支出倾向更高的群体（中低收入家庭）流入边际储蓄倾向更高的群体（高收入家庭和公司 ） 。	As income is redistributed from labor to capital, it flows from those who have a higher marginal propensity to spend (low- and middle-income households) to those who have a higher marginal propensity to save (high-income households and corporations).
共和党挑战者罗姆尼在第一轮电视辩论中大获全胜，增加了他的当选机会，在就伊朗核问题做出任何重大决定之前，美国可能产生一个新政府。	Republican challenger Mitt Romney’s success in the first debate improves his chances and the prospect of a new administration settling in before any major decisions are made on the Iranian nuclear issue.
政府的“创业投资引导基金”为风险投资和私募股权投资者提供了总额达274亿美元的资金 — — 这是一项拥有特殊赎回奖励措施的被动性投资。	The government’s Guiding Fund program has provided a total of $27.4 billion to venture capital and private equity investors – a passive investment, but with special redemption incentives.
而仅仅一个月前，大概还有很多人从来没听说过戴维的祖国，一个与莫桑比克、赞比亚和坦桑尼亚接壤的仅有1300万人口的非洲内陆国家。	A month before, it seems safe to assume, many of these people had never heard of his native land, a landlocked African nation of about 13 million people bordering Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania.
日本是世界上最发达的工业国之一，既然它都免不了出现福岛这样的事故，那么在核安全问题上绝对不能心存侥幸。	The fact that an accident such as Fukushima was possible in Japan, one of the world’s most advanced industrial countries, is a reminder that, when it comes to nuclear safety, nothing can be taken for granted.
这已不再是简单的共同利益目标问题或共同安全目标问题，而是发展成一个文化问题，因为尤其是美国越来越依赖亚洲和拉丁美洲，并吸引了越来越多的亚洲和拉美移民。	The question is no longer one of shared interests or common security goals, but of culture, as the United States, in particular, increasingly looks to Asia and Latin America and attracts immigrants from those regions.
幸运的是，根据麦肯锡全球研究所 最近发布的一份报告，从手机开始的数字技术可以迅速解决这个问题，从而促成速度更快、更具包容性的经济增长。	Fortunately, according to a recent report by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), digital technologies – starting with mobile phones – can rapidly fix this problem and foster faster, more inclusive growth.
也许弗拉斯贝克对DiEM25的激进泛欧洲主义最严厉的批评是它指责DiEM25在兜售左翼TINA ： “ 没有替代方案”可以运作于欧盟层面。	Perhaps Flassbeck’s harshest criticism of DiEM25’s radical pan-Europeanism is the charge that we are peddling left-wing TINA: “there is no alternative” to operating at the level of the EU.
已故历史学家菲利普·科廷（Philip Curtin）指出，从一千年前人类刚刚进入城市时期开始，典型的贸易活动就已经包括了商人与外族人混居的网络。	As the late historian Philip Curtin documented, from the beginning of urban life, millennia ago, trade typically involved networks of co-ethnic merchants living among aliens.
与此同时，在中国香港、新加坡和中国，人们要求延长大学教育，使学生获得广泛的文科教育，以期毕业生更倾向于实验和创新。	Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, Singapore, and China, there are calls for extending university programs so that students can obtain a broad, liberal education, in the hope that graduates will be more inclined to experiment and innovate.
而美联储政策失误的根源正是那个所谓的量化理论。 该理论认为价格是由货币供应量以及售出的商品和服务总量所决定的。	What was wrong with the Fed’s policy was the so-called quantity theory of money on which it was based.
面对最近数十年来的所有成就，真实的情况一直是：世界上20%的人口仍然仅靠每天不足1美元的收入生活，同时艾滋病和其他传染病在许多国家肆虐。	For all the successes of recent decades, the fact remains that 20% of the world's population still lives on less than $1 a day, while HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases are ravaging many societies.
萨尔科齐自豪地声称在他担任内政部��期间他驱逐了数以万计的非法移民，而在2005年他把在郊区发动骚乱的穆斯林人称为“人渣 ” 。	Sarkozy has boasted that he expelled tens of thousands of illegal immigrants when he was interior minister, and in 2005 he referred to Muslim rioters in the suburbs as “scum.”
但是，尽管多样化的经济是私人企业赢得更大空间的先决条件，但中东各国政府，特别是在荣景时期，总是偏袒政治关系强的企业，阻挠它们视之为威胁的企业。	But, while a diversified economy presupposes more space for private enterprise, governments in the region, especially during boom times, have tended to favor politically connected firms, and blocked those they view as a threat.
尤其是乌克兰现在已是危机四伏，但是通过为钢铁业处于困境中的乌克兰东部的公共建设工程提供资金来创造就业机会，可以在政治和经济上带来巨大的变化。	Ukraine, in particular, is in a perilous state, but financing public works that would create jobs in Eastern Ukraine, where the steel industry is in distress, could make a major difference both politically and economically.
如果贸易赤字因为消费增加、投资减少而下降，那么减少的投资水平将导致增长率下降，进一步降低长期真实收入水平。	If the trade deficit shrinks because consumption rises and investment falls, the lower level of investment would cause the growth rate to decline, further decreasing the long-run level of real income.
尽管普京表示准备授权采取针对可疑恐怖分子的打击 ， “ 不管他们身在何处 ” ， 但恐怖袭击仍在继续发生。	The attacks have continued, despite Putin’s stated willingness to authorize strikes against suspected terrorists, “wherever they may be.”
我们希望自己的孩子受到最好的教育，因为我们希望他们拥有全方位的生活选择，能够亲身体味生活的奇迹，迎接生活的挑战。	We want the best education possible for our children, because we want them to have a full range of options in life, to be able to appreciate its many marvels and participate in its challenges.
还有一些人使用更准确地定义，即包括所有具有国际影响的国家 — — 任何身份和主权得到承认并选择参与国际讨论和决策的国家。	Still another, more accurate definition encompasses all countries with international influence – that is, any country whose identity and sovereignty is recognized, and that chooses to participate in global discussions and decision-making.
所有这些都要求资金 — — 光是银行资本重组一项就要求数千亿欧元（不过，如果欧元区大国主权债务能更健康的话，此项资金需求会有所减少 ） 。	All of this requires financing – bank recapitalization alone could require hundreds of billions of euros (though these needs would be mitigated somewhat if the sovereign debt of large eurozone countries looked healthier).
普京对国家媒体的控制自2013年12月以来一直在收紧，今日俄罗斯财团对各频道展开重组以便更好地报道俄罗斯“新闻 ” 。	Putin’s grip on state media has been tightening since December 2013, when channels were regrouped in the Rossiya Segodnya consortium to improve the presentation of Russia’s “story.”
但是，19年后，华盛顿中东和平基金会（Foundation for Middle East Peace）报告说，自奥斯陆协定以来，巴勒斯坦领土被占区上的犹太人定居点协定达成前更多了。	But, 19 years later, the Washington-based Foundation for Middle East Peace reports that more Jewish settlements have been built in the occupied Palestinian territories since the Oslo Accords than before they were signed.
1965年，巴基斯坦外交部长佐勒菲卡尔·阿里·布托高调宣布，如果印度这个不共戴天的敌人实现核武器化，巴基斯坦将“吃草，甚至挨饿”来开发自己的核炸弹。	In 1965, Pakistani Foreign Minister Zulficar Ali Bhutto famously declared that if India, its sworn enemy, went nuclear, his country would “eat grass and even go hungry” in order to develop a nuclear bomb of its own.
国企管理者大可以说，严格的监管让国企处于市场竞争劣势，而科技巨头却在免费搭乘国营通讯、交通和金融通道，夺走了国企的午餐。	SOE managers can credibly argue that heavy regulations place them at a competitive disadvantage, and that the tech giants are eating their lunch by free-riding on state-administered telecommunication, transportation, and financial channels.
“悬崖边缘”情景 — — 在为期两年的谈判阶段的最后，监管机制突然来一个转向不明确甚至不确定的变化 — — 必须不惜一切代价避免。	A “cliff-edge” scenario – in which the end of the two-year negotiating period brings a sudden change to an unclear or even undecided regulatory regime – must be avoided at all costs.
民众们充满自信，执政者们小心谨慎：民主制度和真正的自由终于迎来了精神上的春天，它们再也不会在我们的故乡上消失了。	Self-confidence among the governed and caution among the rulers: these are the psychological springs of democracy and true freedom, and they can never again be diverted in our homeland.
财政赤字可能导致已经很低的国内储蓄率进一步下降 — — 有可能进入负区间，2008—2011年就发生过这样的情况 — — 因此有很大的可能，经常项目赤字会剧烈升高。	With fiscal deficits likely to push an already-low domestic saving rate even lower – possibly back into negative territory, as was the case from 2008-11 – there is a great risk of a sharply higher current-account deficit.
而由上述7位受审者所组成的意大利国家大型灾害预防委员会于2009年3月31日在拉奎拉召开了一小时的地震评估会议。	Italy’s National Commission for Prediction and Prevention of Major Risks, which comprised the seven men now on trial, met in L’Aquila for one hour on March 31, 2009, to assess the earthquake swarms.
令人遗憾的是 ， 《 民主杂志》公布的研究结果表明1970到2000年间被认定为“处于过渡阶段”的100个国家中，只有20个成功完成了民主过渡（如智利、阿根廷、波兰和台湾 ） 。	Unfortunately, a study published in the Journal of Democracy showed that out of the 100 countries that were designated “in transition” between 1970 and 2000, only 20 became fully democratic (for example, Chile, Argentina, Poland, and Taiwan).
倘若哈梅内伊事前确不知情，那就意味着政府或革命自卫队内部某些感到权力受威胁的团体已经单独开始了行动。	So, if Khamenei really was unaware of the plot, it means that some elements in the government or the Revolutionary Guards are acting on their own, which is deeply troubling in its own right.
我希望如此。 但对我而言，一项以国内私有消费、医疗和教育为主题的计划比一项基于与前30年相同的增长战略的计划更有说服力。	I hope so, but I would be more convinced by a plan tilted more toward domestic private consumption, health, and education than to one based on the same growth strategy of the past 30 years.
在问题最吸引眼球的国家（南欧，其中又以希腊和西班牙为最 ） ， 年轻人失业只占总失业的不到四分之一。	In those countries where the problem makes the biggest headlines (the eurozone’s south, with Greece and Spain supposedly the worst cases), youth unemployment accounts for less than a quarter of overall unemployment.
他们使用这种特定的类推法并不全是因为历史环境与当前的情况相类似，而是因为那些历史事件已经深深嵌入了公众的意识之中。	They invoke specific analogies not so much because they resemble current conditions, but because they are seared into the public’s consciousness.
尽管存在质疑者，但对亚投行的普遍支持表明收益大于风险，并且中国的措施有助于构建一个向所有人开放的网络。	While there are skeptics, broad support for the AIIB suggests that the benefits outweigh the risks, and that China’s initiatives may help build a network that is open to everyone.
未来几百年的地球居民将居住在更热的世界中，面临更高的海平面，更少的适耕土地和更极端的飓风、干旱和洪水。	Those who live on this planet in future centuries will live in a hotter world, with higher sea levels, less arable land, and more extreme hurricanes, droughts, and floods.
这可以在同卵双胞胎身上得到很好的说明，随着年纪的增长，他们各自DNA由环境造成的印记差异也会越来越大。	This is nicely illustrated in identical twins, who show as they age increasing differences in the way that their identical DNA is marked by the environment.
人类尚未找到距离我们最近的世界，但从统计学的角度它应该离我们约15光年 — — 这在宇宙学中仅仅是一箭之遥而已。	We have not found the nearest such world yet, but statistically it should be within about 15 light years of us – a stone’s throw in cosmic terms.
事实上，尽管人们在ECT是治疗严重的抑郁障碍最有效的方法上有共识，但是，在治疗情绪障碍的大部分方法中，它是最后选择的方法。	In fact, despite a consensus that ECT is the most effective treatment for severe depressive disorder, it comes at the bottom of the list in most treatment regimens for mood disorders.
这意味着其他盈余国家，即德国和日本，可能必须用其经常账户和金融账户盈余为美国的净投资头寸增量赤字提供融资。	This means that other surplus countries like Germany and Japan are likely to be financing the growing US deficit position, from both their current and financial accounts.
这些势头发展非常缓慢，很难成为报纸的头条，但它们合在一起却为农业和农村发展领域的公共和私人投资提供了更为诱人的回报。	These trends move too slowly to make headlines, but cumulatively they offer a whole new world of bigger payoffs from public and private investment in agriculture and rural development.
法国和希腊的最新大选，以及意大利的地方选举和西班牙和爱尔兰没完没了的政坛乱象表明，公众已经对德国人强加在他们头上的严厉紧缩失去了信任。	The recent elections in France and Greece, together with local elections in Italy and continuing unrest in Spain and Ireland, have shown that the public has lost faith in the strict austerity forced upon them by Germany.
朝鲜威胁要对美国采取“千万倍”的报复 — — 包括袭击美国在西太平洋的领土关岛 — — 并重申了其决不放弃核武器的决心。	North Korea has threatened to retaliate against the US “thousands of times” over – including by striking the US territory of Guam in the western Pacific – and reiterated its vow to never give up its nuclear arsenal.
也许我们所看到的仅仅是卫兵交接仪式，花旗银行和汇丰银行的全球地位由中国工商银行、巴西伊塔乌联合银行（Itau Unibanco ） 、 俄罗斯联邦储蓄银行（Sberbank）取而代之。	Perhaps we are just seeing the beginnings of a changing of the guard, and that HSBC and Citibank will be replaced as global players by China’s ICBC, Brazil’s Itau Unibanco, or Russia’s Sberbank.
7月6日，他最新的贸易限制措施 — — 对总值约340亿美元的中国进口产品征收25％的关税 — — 正式生效。	On July 6, his latest trade restrictions – 25% tariffs on about $34 billion of Chinese imports – took effect.
一位记者打趣道，下一次媒体圣诞派对将会在与白宫位于同一条街道上的最新开张的特朗普国际饭店（Trump International Hotel）召开，并且顺带着做做与会者的酒水生意。	One reporter joked that the next press Christmas party would be held at the recently opened Trump International Hotel down the street from the White House, and there would be a cash bar.
但这些人的沙文主义行动却并未止步于此，因为他们还不断推动各种意图把北方意大利人（比如威尼托和伦巴第大区 ） ， 以及来自那不勒斯，卡拉布利亚以及西西里的南部意大利人进行区分对待的政策。	But their chauvinism does not stop there: they constantly propose measures to discriminate between northern Italian citizens from Veneto or Lombardy and southerners from Naples, Calabria, or Sicily.
中国正在在许多方面向好的方向发展 ，而且，向正确的方向发生进一步的变化不太可能从孤立或制裁中国的政策中产生。	China is changing, in many ways for the better, and further change in the right direction is not likely to result from a policy of isolating or sanctioning China.
伦敦 — — 在两天的时间里，卡扎菲和哈特皇储阿齐兹相继去世，他们的死法大相径庭，可谓对式微的老人政治的绝大讽刺。	LONDON – The contrast between the deaths, within two days of each other, of Libya’s Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz is one of terminal buffoonery versus decadent gerontocracy.
一所原本属于国营的企业继续维持运作的原因则是 2001 年签订租赁协议时规定十年之内不能让任何员工下岗。	One formerly state-run enterprise was being operated under a 2001 lease specifying that no workers could be laid off for the next ten years.
而在欧盟核心区，这类党派往往是右派：德国的另一道路党（Alternative ） ， 法国的国民阵线，以及奥地利，荷兰，丹麦，芬兰，瑞典和其他国家的类似极右政党。	In the EU core, such parties tend to be on the right: Alternative for Germany, France’s National Front, and similar far-right parties in Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and elsewhere.
这一关系主要建立在中国以来俄罗斯能源供给、双方都支持将“影响力范围”作为新的世界秩序的概念基础，以及双方在黑海的联合军演的基础上。	It is a relationship founded largely on Chinese dependence on Russian energy supplies, mutual support for “spheres of influence” as the conceptual foundation of an alternative world order, and joint naval exercises in the Black Sea.
出于这一原因，中国正试图以经济和军事援助为杠杆，与甚至在过去有过军事对抗的国家改善关系。 其中最明显的莫过于越南和菲律宾。	For this reason, China is attempting to use economic and military aid as leverage to improve relations even with countries with which it has had military confrontations with in the past, most prominently Vietnam and the Philippines.
接着，不知名投资者（据称是最大的几家俄罗斯州银行）因为CBR在12月12日作出的决定而获益 — — 允许这些债券作为抵押换取CBR按政策利率发放的三年期卢布贷款。	Then, unnamed investors (allegedly the largest Russian state banks) benefited from the CBR’s decision on December 12 to allow these bonds to be used as collateral for three-year CBR ruble loans at the policy rate.
一个很少人留意但特朗普政府似乎正在尝试运用新思维的领域是对失业工人进行再培训以及改善高中层面的职业培训。	One little-noticed area where the Trump administration seems to be trying out fresh thinking is the retraining of displaced workers and the improvement of vocational training at the high-school level.
如果这种分析是正确的，我们应该赶紧包一列欧洲之星列车，把银行家们绑个结实然后把车厢封死以防他们在到达英吉利海峡隧道之前跳车，最后把他们送到巴黎去。	If that analysis is correct, we should be packing bankers off to Paris in specially chartered Eurostar trains, sealed to prevent them from attempting to jump off before they reach the Channel Tunnel.
而当今，科学研究却在几乎所有的欧洲国家（瑞典、芬兰和冰岛除外）呈衰退之势。 现有人才被浪费，对年轻人的吸引力不断丧失。	Today, however, European science is declining in almost all countries (Sweden, Finland, and Iceland are exceptions), wasting existing talent and losing attractiveness for young people.
而香港的民众则极可能认为他们别无选择只能用一切手段抗议特首董建华领导下的不受欢迎的政府，从而使其执政变得更为困难。	Hong Kong's people may well conclude that they have no alternative but to use every occasion to protest chief executive Tung Chee-hwa's unpopular government, making it even harder for him to govern.
首先，如果“软实力”意味着因“他人欲你之所欲 ” （ 约瑟夫·奈（Joseph Nye）语）而施加影响，那么全世界女性之所欲乃美国女权主义者已为之奋斗了三代人的东西。	First, if “soft power” means exercising influence because “others want what you want,” as Joseph Nye puts it, then women the world over want what American feminists began fighting for three generations ago.
正如哥伦比亚大学马克·利拉令人信服地指出的那样，在复杂和多元化的民主社会中，仅仅依赖狭隘的身份因素构成的政治吸引力 — — 无论与阶级、宗教、民族还是意识形态相关 — — 最终注定都是要失败的。	As Columbia University’s Mark Lilla has persuasively argued, in complex and diverse democratic societies, political appeals based only on narrow identities – whether linked to class, religion, ethnicity, or, yes, ideology – ultimately are doomed.
考虑到人类来自自身欲望和激情的反社会社会性（unsociable sociability ） ， 他们中间所兴起的过程既无耻，又脆弱。	Given the unsociable sociability of human beings, driven by their appetites and passions, the process by which it is fashioned is both brazen and fragile.
欧洲最终要么迈向更深层次的政治、财政和政策一体化，要么迈向包括适应生产率分化的调整机制 — — 比如更大的劳动力流动性 — — 在内的结构。	Europe eventually must gravitate either toward deeper political, fiscal, and policy integration, or toward a structure that includes adjustment mechanisms – for example, greater labor mobility – to accommodate divergences in productivity.
公私合作的新诉求不仅可能重写发展经济学，还可能重塑整个富国与穷国的关系 — — 尽管未必朝积极的方向发展。	PPPs’ new appeal may redefine not just development economics, but also the overall relationship between rich and poor countries – though not necessarily for the better.
他们，巴西人民，在足球场外抗议祖国举办2014年世界杯 — — 而与此同时，巴西国家足球队在联合会杯决赛上痛宰了西班牙队。	There they were, Brazilians, protesting outside football stadiums against their country hosting the World Cup in 2014 – and this even as their national team was thrashing Spain in the final of the Confederations Cup.
在这方面，消费者必须明白，转基因作物潜力无穷而风险微不足道，政府必须采取实事求是的监管政策，拒绝病态科学。	To that end, consumers must understand that GM crops hold great potential, while posing negligible risks, and governments must adopt regulatory policies that face facts and reject pathological science.
)但是，当我询问首相近况如何时，他马上咧着嘴回答说 ： “ 当你知道不必在位另一场选举而战时，感觉好极了 。 ”	But no sooner had I asked the Prime Minister how he was than he replied with a grin: “It’s nice to know one doesn’t have to fight another election.”
问题不仅仅在于经济美德在道义上的欠缺，而是它们的消失。 辛勤工作和创造性依然受到奖赏，但是自我克制、节俭和谨慎随着第一张信用卡的诞生显然已经开始消失了。	The problem is not just the moral inadequacy of the economic virtues, but their disappearance. Hard work and inventiveness are still rewarded, but self-restraint, thrift, and prudence surely started to vanish with the first credit card.
但和美国和欧洲一样，日本仍然像堂吉诃德那样执着地向通缩的风车发动进攻，将利率设置在极低水平，买入大规模政府债务。	Yet Japan, like the US and Europe, continues to display a quixotic tendency to tilt at deflation windmills, with rock-bottom interest rates and purchases of massive amounts of government debt.
对俄国乌克兰冒险的恰当回应不仅要联合其他欧盟国家协助基辅政府稳定经济；此外还应包括扩大国防开支并说服北约成员国也这样做。	The proper response to Russian adventurism in Ukraine should not only be to work with the rest of the EU to help the government in Kyiv steady its economy; it should also include ramping up defense spending and convincing NATO members to do the same.
尽管如此，它建立了一个可靠的框架阻止伊朗在未来10—15年制造核武器 — — 而这是一个非常积极的结果。	Nonetheless, it creates a solid framework to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons for the next 10-15 years – and that is a very positive development.
巴黎 — — 十九世纪末，大英帝国奉行其所谓“光荣孤立”的政策，反映了其领导人在国际交往中置身事外的决心。	PARIS – At the end of the nineteenth century, the British Empire pursued a policy of what it called “splendid isolation,” reflecting its leaders’ determination to stand aloof from international engagements.
目前来看，互联网活动家连同谷歌、Facebook和其他主要在线企业暂时占据优势，说服美国国会将反盗版法案束之高阁。	For the moment, Internet activists, together with Google, Facebook, and other major online players, have carried the day, persuading the US Congress to shelve its anti-piracy legislation.
除了这些创新，我们还可以期待看到无数我们曾经称为“专家系统”的例子：AI应用在各种专业领域辅助乃至取代人类专业人士。	Beyond these innovations, we can expect to see countless more examples of what were once called “expert systems”: AI applications that aid, or even replace, human professionals in various specialties.
由于工资仍在上升，2015年的通胀目标定在3 % — —高于2014年2%的实际水平，尽管生产者价格指数负增长已有36个月。	Because wages are still rising, the inflation target for 2015 has been set at 3% – higher than the actual 2014 inflation of 2%, even though producer-price inflation has been negative for 36 months.
该计划的主要特点就是将原本着眼于GDP增长最大化的官方政策转变为对消费以及劳动者平均生活水平的提高。	Its key feature is to shift official policy from maximizing GDP growth toward raising consumption and average workers’ standard of living.
欧洲得益于英国的民主传统、对其他国家的开放、对官僚障碍的缺乏耐心、甚至是它对抽象乌托邦计划的怀疑态度。	Europe has benefited from Britain’s democratic traditions, its openness to the rest of the world, its impatience with bureaucratic obstruction, and even its skepticism toward abstract utopian schemes.
但是北约不断表现韧性并不应该让我们忽视这一事实，也就是它并不再给跨大西洋安全关系提供任何健康的基础。	But NATO’s repeated demonstrations of resilience should not blind us to the fact that it no longer provides a healthy basis for the transatlantic security relationship.
在这样的背景下，必须将俄罗斯总统普京动摇乌克兰的行为置于他领导“欧亚联盟”的梦想中加以考察。 “欧亚联盟”是略加掩饰的再建前苏联的计划。	In this context, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s destabilization of Ukraine cannot be separated from his dream of leading a “Eurasian Union” – a thinly disguised effort to recreate the former Soviet Union.
反对党国大党党员、卡纳塔克邦首席部长最近宣布他要吃牛肉，而执政党印度人民党的一位政客威胁说，如果他真的吃了牛肉，就要他的项上人头。	After the chief minister of Karnataka, a member of the opposition Congress party, recently declared that he would eat beef, a politician from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) threatened to behead him if he follows through.
此次危机一个极端但不太可能的解决方案或许是由军队执行政权更迭，用一位更加顺从的阿勒萨尼皇室家族成员取代现任卡塔尔埃米尔谢赫·塔米姆·本·哈马德·阿勒萨尼。	An extreme but unlikely solution to the crisis could come in the form of military-enforced regime change, whereby the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, would be replaced by a more pliant member of the Al-Thani family.
在大学里，女生不仅在人数上超过男生，而且她们也比男生成绩要好，最为显著的是在数学、物理以及信息科学方面。	Women not only outnumber men at universities; they also outperform them, most notably in math, physics, and information science.
许多成熟的民主国家要求英国脱欧这样的宪政意义上的改变需要压倒性多数支持，但英国从来不认为需要这样的制衡。	While many mature democracies would require some kind of super-majority to confirm an enormous constitutional change like Brexit, the UK has never seen the need for such checks and balances.
尽管开尔文的估算出现了严重的错误，但他的努力仍在知识史中占有中心地位，因为他将真正的科学 — — 物理学定律 — — 应用于长期以来只靠模糊猜测的问题。	Though Kelvin’s estimate was seriously flawed, the effort remains central to the history of knowledge, because it applied real science – the laws of physics – to what had long been a subject of vague speculation.
虽然恐怖袭击造成了不可弥补的生命和财产损失，但随后由美国领导的伊拉克战争却严重反应过激；这场战争真正地毁灭一切。	While the attacks were immensely costly in terms of lives lost and material damage, the US-led war in Iraq that followed was beyond disproportionate; it was truly devastating.
奥运会的举办可能会提高中国在全球的威望。 毫无疑问，会组织得很完美，不会看到抗议者、无家可归者、持不同信仰者或任何其他类型的扫兴者。	The Olympic Games – no doubt perfectly organized, without a protester, homeless person, religious dissenter, or any other kind of spoilsport in sight – will probably bolster China’s global prestige.
美国的小布什政府为全球基金会提供了强大而重要的支持 — — 同时也创立了一系列对抗艾滋和疟疾的新美国公共项目。	US President George W. Bush’s administration provided strong and important support for the Global Fund – and also created new US programs to fight AIDS and malaria.
但第一步是关税联盟，而在欧亚联盟的例子中，关税联盟必须包括位于俄罗斯西部的其最大邻国 — — 乌克兰。	But the first step is a customs union, and, in the case of the Eurasian Union, it had to include Ukraine, Russia’s largest neighbor to the west.
报告本身在没有援引证据的情况下将两者联系起来，但粮农组织的公告更进一步，尖锐地宣称“受冲突和气候变化推动，世界饥饿问题再次恶化 ” 。	The report itself links the two without citing evidence, but the FAO’s communiqué goes further, declaring starkly, “World hunger again on the rise, driven by conflict and climate change.”
这些措施包括扩大金融市场，让更多的人能够获得信用和投资；增强社会安全网以保护经济弱势群体；以及增加教育的可获得性和平等性。	Such steps include broadening financial markets to give more people access to credit and investment, strengthening social safety nets to protect the economically vulnerable, and improving educational access and quality.
新兴国家外汇储备总量自1994年以来首次出现下降。 从1994年开始，新兴市场外汇储备大幅攀升，成为过去二十年来全球经济的一个显著特征。	And the aggregate foreign-exchange reserves held by emerging countries declined for the first time since 1994, when they began the steep upward climb that has been a defining feature of the global economy during the last two decades.
值得注意的是，这些巨头的大部分收入依然来自其核心产品 — — 例如苹果的iPhone，微软的Office和Google搜索引擎。	It is notable that Big Tech still derives most of its revenues from its companies’ core products – for example, the Apple iPhone, Microsoft Office, and the Google search engine.
政治学家约翰·鲁杰（John Ruggie）在1982年提出这样的观点，即第二次世界大战后的多边主义和自由贸易是“植入式自由主义实现妥协”的结果。	Political scientist John Ruggie made the case in 1982 that post-World War II multilateralism and free trade was the result of a “compromise of embedded liberalism.”
普京借此时机重复他的论调 — — “俄罗斯正在发展自己的民主 ” — —与此同时他却拒绝了波罗的海国家的要求，他们要俄罗斯交待它在二战末期与希特勒达成入侵这些国家的交易的内幕。	Putin took that occasion to repeat his political mantra – “Russia is developing it’s own brand of democracy” – while spurning requests from the Baltic countries that Russia come clean about its deal with Hitler to devour them on WWII’s eve.
此收入损失可以用所谓的“公司税支出”的减少（即税前扣减、税收豁免和其他对某些经济活动的税收补贴）以及惩罚他人（扩大公司税基）弥补。	These revenue losses could be offset by curtailing so-called “corporate-tax expenditures” – deductions, credits, and other special tax provisions that subsidize some economic activities while penalizing others – and broadening the corporate-tax base.
中东地区的输家也非常明确：感觉生存受到威胁、开始将国内什叶派���数族裔视为伊朗第五纵队的沙特阿拉伯和其他海湾国家。	The losers in the region are also clear: Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states, which feel existentially threatened, and have come to regard their own Shia minorities as an Iranian fifth column.
顺理成章的结果是恐惧得到了遏制：当被问及移民是否抢走了本土居民的就业机会时，80％的德国人及77％的瑞典人都表示并非如此。	As a result, fear is muted: asked whether immigrants take away jobs from native-born citizens, 80% of Germans and 77% of Swedes said that they do not.
而产业界支持的短期研究会精心挑选无法反映真实世界情况的被试，在他们身上比较新疗法和安慰剂的效果。 相比之下，前一种方法更切中要害，也更一般化。	Such an approach would be more relevant and generalizable than industry-sponsored short-term studies that compare new treatments to placebos in a fastidiously chosen population that does not reflect real-world conditions.
仅仅想想当前的冲击是怎样提高全球的通货膨胀，降低全球穷人的收入，使美元走软，增加美国的贸易赤字，加重全球金融不稳定并增加了全球衰退的可能性这样一系列情况，就可以知道问题的严重性。	Just consider how the current bout has raised global inflation, lowered incomes of the global poor, weakened the dollar, deepened the US trade deficit, aggravated global financial instability, and increased the likelihood of a global recession.
用电可以解决这个问题，这样可以让家庭成员能在晚上看书、购买冰箱防止食物变质，或者用电脑和全世界沟通。	Access to electricity could solve that problem, while allowing families to read at night, own a refrigerator to keep food from spoiling, or use a computer to connect with the world.
新兴经济体反驳道，它们的人均收入仍远低于发达国家，要应对多种多样的发展挑战，它们需要在贸易责任问题上保持灵活性。	Emerging economies counter that their per capita incomes remain far lower than those of their developed counterparts, and insist that addressing their enormous development challenges demands flexibility in terms of their trade obligations.
意大利当前的实际（排除通胀因素后的）人均GDP依然低于1998年启动欧元实验时的水平，而即便是遭遇了2009年以来萧条的希腊也已经成功地实现了增长。	Italy’s real (inflation-adjusted) per capita GDP is currently lower than it was when the euro experiment began in 1998, whereas even Greece has managed to register growth, despite its depression from 2009 onward.
欧洲右翼民粹主义者 — — 包括一些过去有着强烈反犹立场的党派的代表者 — — 如今骄傲地宣称支持以色列在巴勒斯坦领土建立定居点。	European right-wing populists, including some who represent parties with a strong anti-Semitic past, now proudly proclaim their support for Israeli settlers on Palestinian land.
研究者发现，即使从明天开始切断结核病传播渠道，光是当前潜伏病人数量就能让世卫组织的2035年全球目标无法完成。	Even if all TB transmission were somehow stopped tomorrow, the researchers find that the current pool of latent infections alone will prevent the number of TB cases from falling to the World Health Organization’s global targets for 2035.
这种战斗只是偶尔才会得到“官方”的报道；独立媒体进入该地区的申请被拒绝，许多身处当地的记者则死于可疑的情况。	Access to the area was denied to independent media. Many locally-based correspondents were killed in suspicious circumstances.
30年前，邓小平用“放权让利”的口号成功地激励了地方官员、国有企业和后来的民营企业家接受市场化改革。	Some 30 years ago, Deng Xiaoping used the slogan “delegating power and sharing dividends” to motivate local officials, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and soon-to-be private entrepreneurs to embrace market-oriented reforms.
别人看待法国人的方式影响着法国人对自己的判断，对于我们来讲，没有比被视为冷漠或干脆默默无闻更令人苦恼的问题了。	The way we French are perceived by others affects how we perceive ourselves, and nothing is more troubling for us than to be perceived with indifference or, worse, not to be noticed at all.
有可能发生的冲突还可以成倍增加，从核裁军—法国裁得太多，其他国家太少���到和伊朗，俄罗斯和中国打交道的最佳方法。	And one could multiply the subjects of possible tensions, from nuclear disarmament – too much for the French, too little for many others – to the best ways to deal with Iran, Russia, and China.
根据他们的模型，如此规模的上升伴随着年GDP增长下降0.3个百分点，而在住房市场危机期间，影响会翻番，因为按揭贷款在欧盟银行资产负债表中占比很高。	An increase on that scale is associated in their model with a 0.3-percentage-point reduction in annual growth, and twice that in a housing-market crisis, given the high proportion of mortgage lending on EU banks’ balance sheets.
因此，出于伦理和实际理由，社会科学家长期以来一直在研究社会成员的关注点如何以某种方式反映于集体决策中，即使该社会非完全民主的社会。	So, for both ethical and practical reasons, social scientists have long investigated how the concerns of a society’s members can be reflected in one way or another in its collective decisions, even if the society is not fully democratic.
随着美国总统特朗普的政府退出贸易协定，经济增长将受到拖累，而随着美国开始打破治理市场的范式和机构，增长还将遭受更大的挫折。	US President Donald Trump’s administration will hinder economic growth when it starts to reverse trade agreements, and growth will take an even bigger hit when the US begins to destroy the norms and institutions that govern markets.
一般来说，爆发泰米尔猛虎组织这类冲突都是源自于社会和经济上的不满情绪，比如实际存在或感觉到的歧视，以及政府在充分解决财富和收入差距方面的无能。	Underlying wars such as the fight with the Tamil Tigers are, typically, social and economic grievances such as real or perceived discrimination, and the failure of government to address wealth and income disparities adequately.
或许可能获得克里米亚的完全主权让普京重新考虑了为俄罗斯海军保有叙利亚地中海港口塔尔图斯（Tartus）的价值。	Or perhaps the possibility of regaining full sovereignty over Crimea has led Putin to reconsider the value of retaining Syria’s Mediterranean port of Tartus for the Russian Navy.
布鲁塞尔—2008年大爆发的全球金融危机对欧洲和美国的影响是非常相似的 — — 至少在一开始是如此。	BRUSSELS – The global financial crisis that erupted in full force in 2008 affected Europe and the United States in a very similar way – at least at the start.
但富人更富并不一定会造成大量额外支出，倒确实增加了不平等性和资产泡沫的危险，而资产泡沫有可能带来新的金融动荡。	But greater wealth for the rich does not necessarily produce much extra spending. It does increase inequality and threaten asset bubbles, which could lead to a new financial crash.
根据我们的研究，自然气候解决方案有潜力让二氧化碳年排放量减少大约113亿吨 — — 相当于完全停止燃烧石油。	Natural climate solutions have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by an estimated 11.3 billion tons a year – equal to a complete halt in burning oil, according to our study.
目前还没有证据表明欧元区存在大规模的次级房屋贷款，但是有大量证据表明，尽管各国情况不同，住房价格还是对国内需求有着重大的影响。	While there is little evidence in the euro area of large-scale sub-prime lending, there is considerable evidence to suggest that house prices have an important impact on domestic demand, albeit with wide variations among individual countries.
鉴于有关其战略的公众信息匮乏，很显然他不是二十一世纪治国方略的狂热倡导者 — — 换句话说，他极少高调宣传。	Given the dearth of public information about his strategy, it is clear that he is not an avid practitioner of twenty-first-century statecraft – that is, he does not think out loud.
自2014年以来，这个在财政紧缩政策压力下挣扎的国家不得不应付自2014年以来涌入的110万难民，而且每天还有数百名难民继续抵达莱斯博斯岛。	Already struggling under the weight of austerity, the country has had to cope with 1.1 million refugee arrivals since 2014, and hundreds more refugees continue to arrive on the shores of Lesbos every day.
为确保实现可持续发展，设计制度时必须考虑到纳西姆•塔勒布提出的所谓罕见的“黑天鹅”事件。 全球经济危机爆发证明“黑天鹅”事件的确会发生，并造成灾难性后果。	To ensure a system’s sustainability, its design must account for what Nassim N. Taleb called rare “black swan” events – which, as the global economic crisis demonstrated, do occur, with devastating consequences.
但如今我们已经在超过一千所学校中有了经验；超过50,000名学生获得了指导，我们的开展工作的国家范围极广，包括巴基斯坦、美国、约旦、埃及、加拿大、意大利、菲律宾和印尼等。	But we now have experience in more than a thousand schools; over 50,000 students have been taught, and we are working in countries as diverse as Pakistan, India, the US, Jordan, Egypt, Canada, Italy, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
这是个被新闻界迅速曝光的大错误，引发了不止一起司法及警方调查，还引发议会委员会要求内政部长亲自出面作证。	It was a blunder that was quickly revealed by the press, triggering several judicial investigations and police inquiries, as well as a parliamentary commission requiring the appearance of the interior minister himself.
如果戈登关于生产率增长缓慢的看法是对的，那么危机和公共财政混乱导致的债务积压的持续时间将远大于预期。	If Gordon is right about slow productivity growth, the debt overhang inherited from the crisis and public-finance woes will persist for much longer than anticipated.
通过发展自身评估和承担商业条款风险的能力，传统上厌恶风险的多边金融机构可以更有效地与机构投资者展开接触。	By developing the capacity to assess and bear risk on commercial terms, traditionally risk-averse MFIs could engage more productively with institutional investors.
土耳其与叙利亚有900公里的接壤边界，这让它成了 近两百万叙利亚难民的栖身之所，并极易受到伊斯兰国的攻击和渗透。	With a 900-kilometer border with Syria, it is hosting nearly two million Syrian refugees and is vulnerable to attacks and infiltration by the Islamic State.
但以色列历史学家尤瓦尔·诺亚·哈里里（Yuval Noah Harari）的近著为我们提供了纠正这一失衡的机会。	But a recent book by the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari offers an opportunity to correct this imbalance.
民族间的差异不会消失，也没有必要消失；但是若要保证所有的公民能够彼此信赖，就要求我们在公共领域内找到一种能够加深并支持市民间信任的方式。	Differences will not – and need not – go away; but ensuring that all citizens can rely on each other requires us to find a way to extend and bolster the civic trust that we see in the public sphere.
但跟伊朗伊斯兰共和国的缔造者阿亚图拉鲁霍拉·霍梅尼不一样的是，哈梅内伊既缺乏强大的个人魅力，也没有深厚的学养。	Unlike the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Khamenei lacks charisma and deep learning.
没有人知道达沃斯的非洲领导人 — — 他们中的许多人公开谴责特朗普的言论，要求道歉并撤回 — — 在亲眼见到这人时会做出何种反应。	There is no telling how African leaders at Davos – many of whom have publicly denounced Trump’s comments, demanding apologies and retractions – will react to the man in the flesh.
随着约束社交媒体的声音日益高涨，促使决策者采取行动的报道，还需要世间的报纸 — — 到目前为止，人们认为它们是社交媒体的鱼肉对象 — — 来提供。	As calls to rein in social media grow, it is the world’s newspapers – until very recently thought to be on the ropes – that have provided the reporting needed to convince policymakers to act.
要理解个中原因，可以回顾2014年10月欧洲银行局（European Banking Authority，EBA）对欧元区123家大银行所做的资产负债表压力测试，该测试发现所有银行存在250亿欧元的资本短缺。	To understand why, we should look back to October 2014, when the European Banking Authority began balance-sheet stress tests for the eurozone’s largest 123 banks and found a capital shortfall of €25 billion ($28 billion) in all of them.
俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京想让美国为在阿富汗保留军事基地以便在中亚和西南亚地区投射力量的决策付出沉重代价。	Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes to impose significant costs on the US for its decision to maintain military bases in Afghanistan to project power in Central and Southwest Asia.
发自华盛顿特区 — — 跟过去不同，在即将召开的国际货币基金组织和世界银行年会，或者是巴厘岛世界贸易组织贸易部长会议期间或许不会出现大规模抗议行动。	WASHINGTON, DC – Unlike in the past, there probably will not be large protests at the upcoming Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, or at the subsequent World Trade Organization meeting of trade ministers in Bali.
在我们的文章《自由民主的政治经济学 》 （ The Political Economy of Liberal Democracy）中，沙伦·穆坎德（Sharun Mukand）对自由民主的基础进行了讨论，与芒克不谋而合。	In our paper “The Political Economy of Liberal Democracy,” Sharun Mukand and I discuss the underpinnings of liberal democracy in terms similar to those Mounk uses.
纽约 — — 以我的经验，如果左右翼势力、鸽派和鹰派、国际主义者和孤立主义者同时攻击你的外交政策，那么你的政策可能恰到好处。	NEW YORK – In my experience, if you are attacked for your diplomacy from both left and right, by doves and hawks, and by internationalists and isolationists, you probably have it just right.
而公众不是唯一的“受害者 ” ： 就连鲁哈尼的一位经济顾问一开始也夸耀说，人们的境况改善了20 % ， 因为通货膨胀率下降了20个百分点。	And the lay public was not alone: even one of Rouhani’s economic advisers initially boasted that people were 20% better off because the rate of inflation had declined by 20 percentage points.
全世界许多希望现在都指向了以对一个政治家来说非常高的道德主张开始总统任期的巴拉克·奥巴马总统，当然，奥巴马不是救世主；他不能创造奇迹。	Many hopes throughout the world are now directed toward President Barack Obama, who enters his presidency with a moral claim that is extraordinarily high for a politician. Of course, Obama is not the Messiah; he cannot work miracles.
这也许是亚力克西对本尼迪克特的首次演讲做出正面反应的原因之一。 在此次演讲中，本尼迪克特敦促双方修好，说他希望这能改善“苏联解体后，这片土地上东正教与天主教的关系 。 ”	Perhaps this is one reason why Alexi responded positively to Benedict’s first speech urging reconciliation, saying that he hopes that this will improve “Orthodox-Catholic relations on the post-Soviet territory.”
居里夫人是第一位赢得诺贝尔奖的女性，唯一一位两次获得诺贝尔奖的女性，也是唯一一位在两个不同学科获得诺贝尔奖的人：1903年物理学奖和1911年化学奖。	Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the only woman to win two, and the only person to do so in two different sciences: physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911.
但是，除非所有欧洲人都意识到拯救欧元的责任（以及与之捆绑在一起的拯救欧元的责任 ） ， 说再多都没有用。	But, unless all Europeans accept responsibility for saving the euro – and, with it, the EU – everything else is shallow rhetoric.
民粹主义政客通过将移民政治化以及指责移民为失业、福利制度困境和社会凝聚力下降的替罪羊利用了目前的局面。	Populist politicians have taken advantage of the current situation by politicizing migration and scapegoating migrants for socioeconomic problems such as unemployment, welfare-system strains, and deteriorating social cohesion.
实际上，这三件事只要做了其中一件，就完成了所有任务，因为他们实际上是对同一任务和现实的三种不同的描述。	In fact, if you do any one of these things, you have done them all, for they are three ways of describing what is at bottom the same task and the same reality.
高级银行管理人员不再获得现金或股票，而是获得银行长期债券，从而让他们的利益与银行的长期稳定性而非长期股价表现关系更加密切。	Senior bank managers would be paid not in cash or equity, but in the bank’s long-term bonds, thereby giving them a larger financial stake in the bank’s long-term stability, instead of its long-term stock price.
自20世纪80年代拉丁美洲开始民主化以来，只有两位在任者输掉了选举 — — 尼加拉瓜的奥尔特加（他第一次也不是真正靠选举上台的）和多米尼加共和国的梅西亚。	Since Latin America’s democratization in the 1980s, only two incumbents have lost – Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua (who was not really elected the first time) and Hipólito Mejía in the Dominican Republic.
从这个意义上讲，与其只是保护老年人，不如去赋予他们权力，因为大多数发达经济体根本无法为这么一个超大型利益集团带来巨大的新利益。	In this sense, it is better to empower the elderly than simply to protect them. Most advanced economies simply cannot afford massive new benefits for an oversized interest group.
卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和我在2009年的书《这次不一样 》 （ This Time is Different）总结过一张表格，阿根廷此前已有七次违约记录 — — 分别在1827年、1890年、1951年、1956年、1982年、1989年和2001年。	According to the tabulation that Carmen Reinhart and I compiled in our 2009 book This Time is Different, Argentina has defaulted on seven previous occasions – in 1827, 1890, 1951, 1956, 1982, 1989, and 2001.
举例来讲，这就是黎巴嫩“联合”民主赖以存在的脆弱平衡 — — 直至上述平衡被人口增长差异和外来干预所破坏。	This is the kind of precarious balance on which, for example, Lebanon’s “consociational” democracy rested – until differential population growth and external intervention undid it.
现在不一定非得是信奉亚当·斯密理论的芝加哥大学毕业生才能认识到委内瑞拉的生产崩溃在很大程度上归咎于一个令生产几无可能的侵略性越来越强的政府。	One does not have to be a University of Chicago graduate sporting an Adam Smith tie to recognize that the collapse of production in Venezuela owes much to an ever-more intrusive state that has made production all but impossible.
而将消逝性资产货币化所产生的首要影响就是降低了对这些产品的需求，因为一台剪草机可供多个人分享使用了。	The first impact of monetizing vanishing assets could be to lower demand for such goods, since one lawnmower, for example, can serve many people.
发自伊斯兰堡 — — 上周南亚区域合作联盟（SAARC）在马尔代夫召开了第17届年度峰会，各成员国领导人均有出席。	ISLAMABAD – The leaders of the member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation met last week in the Maldives for their 17th annual summit.
更重要的是，欧美究竟要花费多少时间才能复苏，而当这些传统出口目的地一蹶不振之时，亚洲的出口导向型经济又能增长多久？	More importantly, how long will it take Europe and America to recover, and can Asia’s seemingly export-dependent economies continue to grow if their historical markets languish?
但这几个月在日本所发生的事件却证明，虽然我们的某些金融市场已经高度完善，但距离上述理论的实现依然有很长一段距离。	The case of Japan shows that, despite some of our financial markets’ great sophistication, we are still a long way from the theoretical ideal.
只有发达经济体和新兴市场经济体采取强有力、协同并且有效的政策行动，才能确保全球经济在2010年复苏，而不是进入一个更加漫长的经济滞胀期。	Only aggressive, coordinated, and effective policy actions by advanced and emerging-market countries can ensure that the global economy recovers in 2010, rather than entering a more protracted period of economic stagnation.
人权状况无疑仍有改进的空间 — — 特别是对待反对派政治领袖米迪克莎的方式 — — 但邻国厄立特里亚伊萨亚斯·阿费沃尔基的政权比起埃塞俄比亚还要差很多。	The human-rights situation could undoubtedly be improved – in particular, the treatment of the political opposition leader Birtukan Mideksa – but Isaias Afwerki’s regime in neighboring Eritrea is worse by orders of magnitude.
除了帮助遏制当前危机，欧洲还必须致力于帮助脆弱的冲突影响国克服它们所面临的挑战，改善公民福祉，建设繁荣经济。	Beyond helping to manage the crisis today, Europe must commit to helping fragile and conflict-affected countries overcome the challenges they face, improve their citizens’ wellbeing, and build thriving economies.
英格兰职业女子足球队长史蒂夫·霍顿（Steph Houghton）年薪只有65,000英镑，而最昂贵的男子选手内马尔（Neymar）年薪是这一数字的500倍。	The captain of England’s professional women’s team, Steph Houghton, is paid just £65,000 ($90,000) a year, whereas Neymar, the world’s most expensive male player, receives roughly 500 times as much.
而在其他国家，比如约旦、摩洛哥、科威特，也门和巴林，执政者在许多领域都将民主排除在外，而极端主义则迅速乘虚而入。	Other countries, such as Jordan, Morocco, Kuwait, Yemen, and Bahrain, have created more limited space for democracy. There, too, Islamists have immediately filled it.
他还考虑了早先的核策略建议，包括来自当时最优秀的博弈论专家托马斯·谢林（Thomas Schelling）在内。 谢林后来获得了诺贝尔经济学奖。	He also considered earlier advice on nuclear strategy, which he had sought from some of the finest game theorists of the time, including Thomas Schelling, who would later win the Nobel Prize.
而布什政府却正向伊拉克增派21000名美国士兵，并敦促盟国增兵阿富汗。 美国的盟友们正抵制其中东政策。	Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq, and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America’s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy.
如果市场原教旨主义政治明确地禁止收入再分配或者，或者禁止可以补偿因为自由贸易和劳动力市场“灵活性”而蒙受损失者的地区、行业和教育补贴会如何？	What if market-fundamentalist politics specifically prohibits the income redistribution or regional, industrial, and education subsidies that could compensate those who suffer from free trade and labor-market “flexibility”?
在你们指责我没有理解大屠杀受害者的敏感、或者奥地利反犹性质之前，我应该说，我就是一个奥地利犹太人的儿子。	Before you accuse me of failing to understand the sensitivities of victims of the Holocaust, or the nature of Austrian anti-Semitism, I should say that I am the son of Austrian Jews.
就连人类孢疹病毒（Epstein-Barr virus）疫苗（可预防某些种类的淋巴癌）也获得了可喜的成果。	Even an Epstein-Barr virus vaccine, which would protect against some kinds of lymphoma, is achieving promising results.
黎巴嫩近代史给人们的教训中，有一个比其它都引人注目，即：在诸如黎巴嫩和伊拉克这样的政权分掌社会，联盟民主体制比多数选举制的胜者全拿型民主更受青睐。	One lesson from Lebanon’s recent history stands out above all others: in divided political societies such as Lebanon and Iraq, coalition democracy is preferable to majoritarian winner-takes-all democracy.
然而，随着越来越多的民众不得不逃离冲突和自然灾害，各个难民定居点容纳的人口不断增加，但与之相配套的工程技术还不足够。	Still, not enough engineering expertise has been brought to bear in refugee settlements, whose populations have swelled in recent years as more people have had to flee from conflicts and natural disasters.
加之像非洲开发银行等机构所代表的地区本土知识阶层的崛起，目前的情况似乎是非洲的发展机会可能最终到来了。	Add to that the emergence of an indigenous intelligentsia in the region, exemplified by organizations like the AfDB, and it seems that Africa’s moment may have arrived at last.
1965—1966年，500,000印尼共产党（印尼共）党员和同情者遭遇大屠杀，这是上个世纪最鲜为人知的种族灭绝。	The massacre of some 500,000 members or sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) during 1965-1966 is the least talked-about genocide of the last century.
今年2月，斯德哥尔摩仲裁法庭裁定，俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司必须为破坏两家企业之前的协定赔偿乌克兰石油天然气公司损失25.6亿美元。	In February, the Stockholm arbitration court ruled that Gazprom must award Naftogaz $2.56 billion in damages for breach of a previous agreement between the two companies.
保护责任思想在2005年联合国大会上获得一致通过，它认为，国际社会有义务实施干预以保护遭受本国政府大面积打击的平民。	This doctrine, adopted unanimously by the UN General Assembly in 2005, holds that the international community is obliged to intervene to protect a civilian population under massive attack by its own government.
爱尔兰是唯一把条约付诸全民公决的国家，其他所有成员国都决定通过议会表决来批准这一条约。 所有迹象都表明表决结果将会十分接近。	Ireland is the only country to put the Treaty to a referendum – all the other member states have chosen to ratify the Treaty by parliamentary means – and everything indicates that the result will be close.
这是已经得到正式承认的史实，那么为什么要在撤回道歉会让日本与中韩本已紧张的关系再次急转直下的时刻又重新拿出来讨论？	This has been officially admitted, so why reopen the ghastly business now, at a time when rescinding the apology would make Japan’s already-strained relations with China and South Korea many times worse?
巴西需要新的增长模式，该模式有四大基础要素：更紧的财政政策、更松的货币政策、降低国有银行在信用供给中的作用，以及降低巴西畸高的私人贷款成本的措施。	Brazil needs a new growth model, based on four key elements: tighter fiscal policy, looser monetary policy, a reduced role for state-owned banks in credit provision, and measures to lower Brazil’s astronomical private lending costs.
其新任首席经济学家是贸易专家，而世界银行的领导层应该授权她去为商品，服务和人员的开放市场做出明智的指引。	Its new chief economist is an expert on trade. The Bank’s leadership should empower her to lead the charge in making the intellectual case for open markets for goods, services, and people.

大多数会采用更加先进的税收制度，例如为降低低收入劳动者的有效边际税率 — — 就是美国总统奥巴马所提出的 “让工作真正挣钱 ” 。	Most would make the tax system more progressive, by, for example, lowering the effective marginal tax rate for low-income workers – what US President Barack Obama has called “making work pay.”
选战期间，克林顿常常援引第一夫人米歇尔·奥巴马的话 ： “ 身段放得越低 ， ” 她说 ， “ 形象变得越高 。 ”	During the campaign, Clinton often quoted First Lady Michelle Obama: “When they go low,” she would declare, “we go high.”
虽然那些不上网的人也可以从那些在日常生活中暗中运行的应用程序中获益，例如智能信号灯可以帮助疏导交通流量，但却无法访问所有的智慧城市程序。	While offline populations can benefit from applications running in the background of daily life – such as intelligent signals that help with traffic flows – they will not have access to the full range of smart-city programs.
迪拜—只要你来到中东，就一定会注意到该地区青年的教育、企业家精神和职业志向与剥夺他们大多数人的积极为来的严酷现实之间的巨大差距。	DUBAI – No visitor to the Middle East can avoid noticing the yawning gap between the educational, entrepreneurial, and occupational aspirations of the region’s young people and the harsh reality that deprives so many of them of a positive future.
叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德不是在为某个伊斯兰教派而战（他属于阿拉维派 ） ， 而是在为自己的生存而战。	Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad is not fighting for a particular sect of Islam (the Alawites in his case), but for his survival.
但人造计算机效率低下不仅是因为它们需要为芯片供能，也是因为它们需要能源运行空调从而带走处理器所产生的热量。	But man-made computers are so inefficient not only because they need to power the chips, but also because they need energy to run the air conditioners that remove the heat generated by the processors.
据新闻报道，安全部队射杀了100多人，加上今年早些时候的死亡人数，今年已经成为苏丹近几年来死亡人数最血腥的一年。	According to news reports, security forces have shot over 100 people, adding to a toll of casualties that has made this year one of the deadliest in Sudan’s recent history.
正如他在就职演说中所指出的那样 ： “ 我们不惜付出任何代价、承担任何重任、迎接任何困难、支持任何盟友、反对任何敌人，来确保自由的延续和成功 。 ”	As he said in his inaugural speech: “[W]e shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty.”
相反，埃尔多安最近对俄罗斯和以色列的妥协，及其显而易见意欲不再在叙利亚内战中扮演积极角色的姿态，必然让土耳其军队高层松了口气。	On the contrary, Erdoğan’s recent reconciliation with Russia and Israel, together with his apparent desire to pull back from an active role in the Syrian civil war, must have been a relief to Turkey’s top brass.
工党领导人埃德·米利班德（Ed Miliband）在去年看来还是个优柔寡断,不招人喜欢的家伙；但或许得益于原本不高的预期，他的形象也随着竞选的不断推进而日渐变得更可信也更具政治家风范了。	Labour’s leader, Ed Miliband, was widely derided last year as weak, unconvincing, and unlikeable; but, perhaps benefiting from low expectations, he has looked steadily more credible and statesmanlike as the campaign has gone on.
作为企业融资的专家30年来一直在说，太多的债务和太少的股本使成本过高，因此降低的债务的票面价值，不仅有利于股权持有人，有时还有利于债务持有人。	As corporate finance experts have been saying for 30 years, having too much debt and too little equity is costly, so reducing the face value of debt can sometimes benefit not only equity-holders, but also debt-holders.
其次，逊尼派多数和阿拉维-比克特西派少数之间存在历史对立，后者与什叶派伊斯兰教有着并不��密的联系。	Second, there is an underlying historical tension between the large Sunni majority and the Alevi-Bektashi minority, loosely linked to Shia Islam.

当中国经济增长时，它从其他国家大量进口，强有力地提振了全球经济。 2004年到2006年，2009年至2010年，还有2017年，中国经济的快速增长都推动了世界经济的发展。	The reason, Northwestern University’s Robert Gordon says, is that despite the promise of modern technologies, ever-slower productivity growth has dragged down the growth potential of these rich economies.
例如，自瑙鲁协议缔约国于2007年启动船舶日计划以来 — — 该计划限制外国捕鱼船队的捕获量 — — 其年度金枪鱼收入已经从约6，000万美元增长到5亿多。	For example, since PNA-member states launched the Vessel Day Scheme in 2007 – which sets limits on fishing by foreign fleets – their annual tuna earnings have increased from about $60 million to more than $500 million.

值得注意的是，美国法院的国内破产法无法管辖此地，因为这个岛实际上是美国的殖民地，而当地政府却没有为自身立法的权力。	Notably, US courts invalidated the domestic bankruptcy law, ruling that because the island is, in effect, a US colony, its government had no authority to enact its own legislation.
费斯—自2010年所谓的阿拉伯之春暴动开始以来，中东激进主义、暴力和内战的升级已经造成了巨大的人员伤亡和财产损失。	FEZ – The escalation of radicalism, violence, and civil wars in the Middle East since the so-called Arab Spring revolts began in 2010 has exacted a massive toll in human lives and welfare.
而在短短两年内允许150万移民入境也给德国的福利国家制度带来了沉重负担，无心插柳地鼓动了英国退欧派，也激起了东欧国家的全体反对。	By admitting 1.5 million migrants in just two years, Germany has also placed a massive burden on its welfare state, inadvertently encouraged the Brexiteers, and rallied all of Eastern Europe against it.

特别是，对于维持市场份额至关重要的银行来说，你无法期待它们约束高风险贷款，特别是在情况转坏有纳税人援助兜底的情况下。	In particular, banks, for which maintaining market share is crucial, cannot be expected to constrain risky lending, especially given the expectation that, if things do go wrong, the taxpayers will fund a bailout.
去年，美联储仅仅宣布将逐渐减少其月度长期金融资产购买量便在全球金融市场和新兴市场引发了“取消”之怒。	Last year, the Fed’s mere announcement that it would gradually wind down its monthly purchases of long-term financial assets triggered a “taper” tantrum in global financial markets and emerging markets.
印度这一比例可能更高，因为日益普及的4G服务和越来越廉价的上网智能手机近年来已经使数百万人上网 — — 因此提供了海量的个人信息。	In India, that percentage may be even higher, as increasingly ubiquitous 4G services and increasingly cheap Internet-enabled smartphones have recently enabled millions to get online – and offer up significant amounts of personal information.
任何审判法官或刑事律师都可以证明，在法律案件中辩方每邀请一名心理学家，控方都可以邀请另一位证明相反的观点。	As any trial judge or criminal lawyer can attest, for every psychological expert produced by the defense in a legal case, prosecutors can produce one to argue the opposite.
而另一方面，联合国成员国和世界各地民众则要求联合国在更多地方发挥前所未有的作用 — — 这种趋势在2011年不会发生改变。	On the other hand, UN member states and people around the world are asking it to do more, in more places, than ever before – a trend that will continue in 2011.

而即便有税收补贴，一些出口商也将破产，因为最近一份纽约联邦储备委员会报告指出，这些出口商得依靠进口中间产品来生产自身产品。	And, despite the tax subsidy, some exporters would lose, because, as a recent New York Federal Reserve note points out, they rely on imported intermediate goods in producing their products.
2015年，一个联合国政府专家组（包括美国，俄罗斯，中国和大多数具备强大网络实力的国家）就一个在和平时期不得攻击民用设施的规范上达成了一致。	In 2015, a United Nations Group of Government Experts (including the US, Russia, China, and most states with significant cyber capabilities) agreed to a norm of not targeting civilian facilities in peacetime.
事实上，没有人 — — 不论是俄罗斯、美国、伊朗、沙特还是其他任何支持政权或叛军的赞助者 — — 能保证日内瓦II可以成功。	Indeed, no one – not Russia, the US, Iran, Saudi Arabia, or other external patrons of either the regime or the opposition – can guarantee that Geneva II will succeed.
随着全球化所带来的好处越来越明显，自给自足政策所造成的损害也不言而喻，东方国家的决策者开始明白自己反对全球化的立场是一个错误。	As the benefits of globalization became manifest, and the damage wrought by autarkic policies also became evident, policymakers in the East began to appreciate that their anti-globalization stance had been a mistake.
令人欣喜的是，美国汽车工会（United Automobile Workers）最近宣布，在继续推进集体讨价还价权的同时，它也正在与管理层合作，在田纳西州德资大众汽车工厂成立工作委员会。	Promisingly, the United Automobile Workers union recently announced that, as it continues to push for collective bargaining rights, it is also cooperating with management to form a works council in the German-owned Volkswagen plant in Tennessee.

对当前困境反应不力的原因可以追溯到米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）在解释大萧条历史的竞争中胜过了凯恩斯主义和明斯基主义同道。	The inadequate response to our current troubles can be traced to the triumph of the monetarist disciples of Milton Friedman over their Keynesian and Minskyite peers in describing the history of the Great Depression.
很难想象总需求的任何增长能够推动房地产市场重新雇佣所有人员，而且请记住一点，稳定升值预期支撑了房地产市场的��荣发展，而今天看来这些希望已经彻底破灭。	It is hard to believe that any increase in aggregate demand will boost the housing market – which, remember, was buoyed by visions of steady price appreciation that few seem likely to hold today – sufficiently to re-employ all these workers.
再加上美国的避险地位，以及美国利率的任何重新定价肯定会反映经济复苏的事实，对美国国债的购买欲望必定极为强烈。	Add to that America’s safe-haven status, and the fact that any re-pricing of US rates surely would reflect an economic resurgence, and the bid for US Treasuries should be exceptionally strong.
实际上，公众讨论正从主流报纸向互联网转移，这打破了传统精英阶层的权威：报纸主编，政治专栏作家，学者和政界人物。	Indeed, the shift of public debate from the mainstream press to the Internet has helped to break down the authority of traditional elites: newspaper editors, political columnists, academics, politicians.
各国在评估经济刺激方案的规模时，都会在 本国 预算的成本和收益之间保持平衡，而这一收益是以本国的经济增幅和就业率增幅来计算的。	In assessing the size of the stimulus, countries will balance the cost to their own budgets with the benefits in terms of increased growth and employment for their own economies.
理解这些新发展趋势有助于获得足够动力在七年多的冲突后启动真正的朝韩合作、帮助引导朝鲜半岛走向更和平、更安全的未来。	Understanding these developments could help to generate enough momentum to initiate, after more than seven years of confrontation, genuine inter-Korean cooperation and help guide the peninsula toward a more peaceful and secure future.

中国继续在南海领土主张问题上采取强硬路线，这意味着美国必须保持警惕以确保安全地进入该地区的重要航线。	China has continued to take a hard line on its territorial claims in the South China Sea, which means that the US will have to remain vigilant to ensure safe access to the region’s vital shipping lanes.
而和这几次选举一样，他本人的政党意大利前进党（Forza Italia）的主要合作伙伴将是分离主义、反移民、疑欧派的北方联盟（Northern League ） 。	And, as in those elections, his own party, Forza Italia, will have as its main partner the separatist, anti-immigrant, and Euroskeptic Northern League.

通过建立地区性，全国性甚至全球性的就业市场，平台令雇主可以在更大型的人才库中甄选英才，也让求职者能去检索数量更加庞大的就业机会。	By creating regional, national, and even global job markets, they allow employers to tap into broader talent pools and connect job seekers with a wider universe of opportunities.

国际奥委会如今已经成为了一座展现某些人类最低贱品行 — — 贪婪、 虚伪和剥削 — — 的屈辱柱，也正是这些导致很多机构丧失了人们的信任。	The IOC has become a monument to some of humanity’s worst tendencies – the greed, hypocrisy, and exploitation that have led so many to distrust institutions.
意大利经济只有重新获得竞争力，才能实现可持续增长，而要想在欧元区内部增强竞争力，只有一条路：降低意大利商品相对于欧元区竞争对手的价格。	Sustainable growth can be achieved only if Italy’s economy regains its competitiveness, and within the eurozone there is only one way to accomplish this: by reducing the prices of its goods relative to those of its eurozone competitors.

国会在1932年 — — 也是一个总统选举年 — — 要求复兴金融公司公布接受贷款的银行名录，这可绝非巧合。	It is no coincidence that the demand by Congress for the list of RFC loans occurred in 1932, also a presidential election year.

奥巴马的预算草案认识到，不可能所有目标和预期同时达到，从现在看，增长从某种程度上说是一个分配问题，而从长期看，它是一个代际问题（也是潜在的包容性和社会稳定性问题 ） 。	Obama’s proposed budget recognizes that all objectives and expectations cannot be met, and that growth is partly a distributional issue now and an intergenerational issue (and potentially one of inclusiveness and social stability) in the longer term.
其次，我们必须让日本的劳动力监管规则适应几乎全球皆然的现代生活范式 — — 这意味着让所有个体都获得生活和工作的有益平衡。	Second, we must adapt Japan’s labor regulations to the norms of modern life almost everywhere, which means allowing every individual to strike a beneficial balance between life and work.
这样可以弥补发展中国家企业因公共投资短缺、培训和设备不足以及购买技术许可证或知识产权的财政资源稀缺所面临的某些缺陷。	This makes up for some of the shortcomings that firms in developing countries face as a result of lower public investment, inadequate training and equipment, and scarce financial resources to purchase technology licenses or intellectual property.

2013年，联合国将11月2日定为终止针对记者犯罪不受惩罚现象国际日，力求以此引发全球对这一问题的关注。	In 2013, the United Nations sought to bring global attention to the problem by making November 2 the annual International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists.

几十年来，巴西经济政策一直是背靠其巨大的国内市场优势制定的，通过复杂的补贴、税收和关税制度保护本地产业。	For decades, Brazil’s economic policy has drawn on the strength of its huge domestic market and protected local industries through a complex system of subsidies, taxes, and tariffs.
放弃某些国家预算控制来实现财政一体化在政治上似乎是不可能的，而讨论修改条约 — — 即使它来自德国财政部长 — — 不过是些空洞的修辞包装而已。	Relinquishing some control over national budgets to achieve fiscal integration appears politically impossible, and talk of treaty changes – even if it comes from the German finance minister – amounts to little more than empty rhetorical finery.
自大萧条和第二次世界大战以及1947年签署《关税及贸易总协定》以来，美国 — — 无论是政府还是人民 — — 都一直是自由贸易的不二支持者。	Ever since the Great Depression and World War II, and the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the United States – both its government and its people – has been squarely in support of free trade.
1996年，在尼日利亚北部爆发大规模脑膜炎时，辉瑞公司在向当地医生提供口服抗生素特洛芬的同时把服用头孢曲松的病人设为“控制组 ” ， 藉此将测试特洛芬与当前最有效药物进行对比。	During a major meningitis epidemic in northern Nigeria in 1996, the drug company Pfizer supplied doctors with the oral antibiotic Trovan, which the firm wanted to test against the most effective known drug, Ceftriaxone, as a “control.”

从前那种只顾眼前利益的互动已经令双方都养成了一种难以更改的长期行为模式，致使双方更难从当今这种不可持续的均衡中脱身出来。	Myopic actions on both sides have helped entrench a longer-term pattern of behavior that only makes it harder to move away from today’s unsustainable equilibrium.
幸运的是，欧盟本身也有着在挑战面前蒙混过关的优良传统。 长期以来，欧盟一直依赖乱七八糟的安排来满足其不同成员国的需要和要求。	Fortunately, the EU itself also has a proud tradition of muddling through the challenges it faces, long relying on messy arrangements to accommodate its various members’ needs and demands.
他们告诉我，在过去，肝炎病人需要跋涉数小时才能到达城市医院获得诊断和治疗，许多无力前往城市的患者只能放弃治疗饱受病痛折磨。	They told me that in the past, hepatitis patients had to travel for hours to be diagnosed and treated at a city hospital, while many others who were unable to make the journey suffered without treatment.

所有的后冷战时期对欧洲的确定性消失了，普京能可靠地治理俄罗斯经济的声望也随之消失了。 资本开始逃离俄罗斯。	All the post-Cold War certainties in Europe melted away, and with them went Putin’s reputation as a reliable manager of Russia’s economy.
甚至连最大、最有活力的新兴经济体中国，去年增长率也达到了1990年（6.9 % ） 以来的最低水平，预计今年减速之势还会加剧。	Even China, the largest and most dynamic emerging economy, recorded its lowest growth rate since 1990 (6.9%) last year, and the slowdown is forecast to accelerate this year.
实际上，真正纪念死难者唯一的方法不是简单地把城镇及经济恢复到之前日渐萎缩的状态，而是从海啸的废墟上创造出日本新的发展模式。	Indeed, the only way truly to honor those who lost their lives is to create a new-model Japan from the tsunami’s wreckage, rather than simply restoring towns and their economies to their previous decadent conditions.
而当绰号“冰公主”的朴槿惠不出意外地保住其核心选民时，超过2000万韩国人正在利用手机上twitter或者facebook并以此跟踪政治动向。	While the “Ice Princess,” as Park is nicknamed, will undoubtedly retain her core voters, more than 20 million South Koreans now access Twitter or Facebook on their cellphones, and follow politics on them.
以量化宽松的方式进行市场操纵是否完成了目标 — — 为饱受危机冲击、依赖资产的经济提供刺激 — — 仍有待争议：毕竟，目前发达世界的复苏相当萎靡。	Whether the QE strain of market manipulation has accomplished its objective – to provide stimulus to crisis-torn, asset-dependent economies – is debatable: Current recoveries in the developed world, after all, have been unusually anemic.
尽管距美国边境仍有1，000英里，但特朗普仍将那些难民描绘成迫在眉睫的国家安全威胁，并在毫无证据的情况下警告，难民队伍中混入了“中东人 ” 。	Though still roughly 1,000 miles from the US border, Trump portrayed the refugees as an imminent national security threat, warning, without evidence, that “Middle Easterners” were among them.
但随着IT业的发展，垄断财富急剧增长；到了2015年12月，垄断财富达到了股市总市值的82 % — —大约相当于23.8万亿美元。	But as the IT industry developed, monopoly wealth rose dramatically; it reached 82% of total stock-market value – equivalent to some $23.8 trillion – in December 2015.
他荒谬地声称奥巴马总统“建立”了伊斯兰国，不过，在坚持了两天后，他就将这番话描述为仅仅是一种讽刺，试图以此蒙混过关。	After two days of insisting, absurdly, that President Barack Obama “founded” the Islamic State, he finally tried to play the whole thing off as mere sarcasm.
我们应该清楚的看到，前紧后松的过度紧缩措施往往有可能弄巧成拙，因为这些措施会引发产量、就业和税收的螺旋式下降。	It should be clear by now that excessive, front-loaded austerity measures tend to be self-defeating, because they trigger a downward spiral of output, employment, and tax revenues.
安哥拉、埃塞俄比亚、加纳和尼日利亚也有着令人瞩目的真实增长，但名义GDP是由极大的贸易条件效应和实际升值提振的。	Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria also had very significant real growth, but nominal GDP was boosted by very large terms-of-trade effects and real appreciation.

无论这些政党是否会在不久的将来在选举中取得成功，它们的出现应该使人对欧元长期的过度乐观的看法产生怀疑。	Whether or not these parties succeed at the ballot box in the immediate future, their emergence should cast doubt on overly sanguine views about the euro’s longevity.
中国是否决1997年联合国河道公约的仅有的三个国家之一。 该公约要求共流域国家之间定期交换水文和其他数据。	China is one of just three countries that voted against the 1997 United Nations Watercourse Convention, which called for the regular exchange of hydrological and other data between co-basin states.
尽管如此，美国要求在TPP中写入投资者保护条款，即使其许多“合作伙伴”的物权保护和司法制度与美国一样优秀。	Nonetheless, the US is demanding such provisions in the TPP, even though many of its “partners” have property protections and judicial systems that are as good as its own.
这起地方性恐怖事件具有全国性意义，因为它证明已故美国外交官兼战略家乔治·凯南的警告是正确的，凯南警告美国外交决策者应该遏制自己的行为冲动，特别是在军事方面。	This act of local horror was also one of national significance, for it vindicated the late US diplomat and strategist George F. Kennan’s warning that American foreign policymakers should hold in check their urge to act, especially militarily.
从1931年9月开始，市场紧张起美国来了，出现了资本从美国各银行大规模流出的现象 — — 也就是逃离美元。	Beginning in September 1931, the markets became nervous about the US, causing large outflows from American banks – and thus from the dollar.
上一次通过全面经济抵制让伊朗石油出口下降到可忽略水平是在二十世纪中叶，当时，伊朗深孚众望的当选总理摩萨德实施了石油工业国有化。	The last time Iran’s oil exports were reduced to negligible levels through an extensive economic boycott was in the mid-twentieth century, when Iran’s popularly elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, nationalized the oil industry.
就像汽车的防抱死制动系统防止其在危险环境下侧滑失控，迪拜的三管齐下战略保证其发展计划不偏离轨道，即使是在经济危机之中。	Just as a car’s anti-lock braking system prevents it from skidding out of control in dangerous situations, Dubai’s three-prong strategy keeps its development agenda on track, even during economic crises.
但是，如今中国的“电子零售 ” （ e-tail，面向消费者的电子商务）的崛起正在让中国最大在线零售商阿里巴巴总部所在地 — — 杭州跻身技术创新中心行列。	Now, however, the rise of “e-tail” (consumer-facing e-commerce) in China is enabling Hangzhou – the base of Alibaba, China’s largest online retailer – to join their ranks.

单靠市场并不足以有效刺激那些对不确定技术的研究和发展，并且如果替代燃料供应不足，征收昂贵的碳排放税只会损伤经济的发展。	The market alone is an ineffective way to stimulate research and development into uncertain technology, and a high carbon tax will simply hurt growth if alternatives are not ready.
现在，欧盟委员会要等到本月底才能确定法国是否足够认真地对待改革，因而可以避免因为没有履行其明年将预算赤字削减至GDP的3%以下的承诺而遭受惩罚。	The Commission now has until the end of this month to determine whether France has pursued reform diligently enough to avoid penalties for breaking its pledge to cut its budget deficit to less than 3% of GDP by next year.
从长期看，若总体生育率等于替换率，则称人口规模是稳定的。 就全世界而言，替换率为略高于2.3，但某些地方（主要是发达国家，因为那里的新生儿死亡率更低）要低一些，为2.1。	In the long run, a population is said to be stable if the TFR is at the replacement rate, which is a little above 2.3 for the world as a whole, and somewhat lower, at 2.1, for developed countries, reflecting their lower infant-mortality rates.
根据官方估计，2003年法国的一场热浪造成大约35000人死亡，上个月英国一场类似的热浪造成2000多人死亡。	A heat wave in France in 2003 caused an estimated 35,000 deaths, and a hot spell similar to the one Britain had last month caused more than 2,000 deaths, according to official estimates.

补救现状的第一步是准确估算究竟还剩多少地下水，以及所剩地下水正在如何使用 — — 做到这一点并不容易，但也不是完全不可能。	The first step toward remedying this situation is to establish precisely how much groundwater is left and how it is being used – not easy, but not impossible either.
沙特生产政策显然是去年油价腰斩背后的原因，而7月6日开始的新一轮暴跌就发生在取消伊朗国际制裁的协议达成几天后。	While Saudi production policies were clearly behind last year’s halving of the oil price, the latest plunge began on July 6, within days of the deal to lift international sanctions against Iran.

那些还能回忆起日本自1960年代以来适度而明智的地区政策推进的亚洲国家都越来越希望日本能重新考虑其立场。	For those Asian countries that recall Japan’s moderate and sensible advancement of regional policies since the 1960’s, there is a growing expectation that Japan should re-think its stance.
尽管这些行动大部分都是在地面进行，但是在索马里海岸执行代号为 “ 亚特兰大 ” 的行动也见证了欧盟的首次海上行动。	Although they have mostly been on land, operation “Atlanta” off the coast of Somalia saw the EU’s first naval operation.
与其接受“爱国”不能被强加而只能感召的观点，过分热情的香港“爱国者们”迫不及待地设法用低劣的宣传手段来表忠心。	Instead of accepting that “love” cannot be enforced and must be won, Hong Kong’s over-zealous “patriots” cannot wait to show their loyalty by trying to mandate primitive propaganda.
美联储前主席格林斯潘最近说他现在认为投机泡沫是我们经济的重要驱动力，但是与此同时世界各国的货币主管部门无法控制泡沫。	Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, recently said that he now believes that speculative bubbles are important driving forces in our economy, but that, at the same time, the world’s monetary authorities cannot control bubbles.
这种面临阴影的体系包括结构性投资工具（SIVs ） 、 管道（以资产支持商业票据为自己筹资 ） 、 货币市场基金、对冲基金和投资银行。	This shadow system includes structured investment vehicles (SIVs), conduits, money market funds, hedge funds, and investment banks.
我们可以不选择分裂我们的身份，从而让多边全球问题难以处理；我们可以选择扩大我们的同情心和道德责任心的身份。	Instead of choosing identities that divide us, making it impossible to tackle multiplying global problems, we can shape identities that extend our sense of compassion and moral responsibility.
朝鲜领导人会说这需要更长时间，需要美国和地区盟国一步步采取措施来消除“误解 ” — —这是朝鲜最大的关注。	That, the North’s leaders will say, would take much longer, and would require more step-by-step measures by the US and its regional allies to remove “mistrust” – a favorite North Korean concern.
在了解市政资产的市场价值后，健全资产管理的下一步就是要了解城市从收入和资产价格上涨中获得的收益是什么量级的。	After accounting for the market value of municipal assets, the next step toward sound asset management is to understand the yield that a city earns from the revenue and rising market values of its assets.
但二十一世纪的东亚和二十世纪的欧洲之间存在一个重要区别，因此带来了一个避免所有四个选择的机会：中国有能力给核威胁源头施加巨大的压力。	But an important difference between twenty-first-century East Asia and twentieth-century Europe creates a chance to avoid all four: China is in a position to exert powerful pressure on the source of the nuclear threat.
法院院长支持由该律师提出的动议，即在宪政委员会就涉及希拉克被控法律的合宪性做出裁决之前暂停进行诉讼程序。	The Court’s President complied with the lawyer’s motion to adjourn the proceedings until the Constitutional Council ruled on the constitutionality of the laws under which Chirac is charged.
因为女性劳动力对经济增长尤为重要，像国际货币基金组织这样的机构正致力于与世界各国政府合作，实现在经济领域为女性授权的目标。	Because women’s labor-force participation is so important for growth, organizations such as the IMF are committed to working with governments around the world to empower women economically.
但很明显的一点是，人们对于社会流动性的看法与意识形态和地理位置高度相关，就跟与他们自身境遇的关联性一样。	But what is clear is that people’s views about social mobility have as much to do with ideology and geography as with their circumstances.
这不但引起了关于此话是否正确的讨论（沙特人购买了大量美国军事装备 ） ， 也引起了关于是否应该把它大声说出来的讨论。	That sparked discussion not only about whether it is true (the Saudis purchase huge amounts of military hardware from the US), but also about whether it should have been said out loud.

但是最终我们已经向公开化迈出了实质性的步伐，并且已经获得了欧盟的认可从而使它同意在2007年初接收罗马尼亚加入欧盟。	But there has, at last, been real movement towards openness – progress recognized by the European Union when it gave Romania the green light to join the European Union at the beginning of 2007.
由洛克菲勒基金会召集、现已征集到300多个签名的《经济学家宣言 》 （ Economists’ Declaration）背后的更广泛的动力将全球卫生与发展推向了一个历史十字路口。	And the broader impetus behind this Economists’ Declaration, convened by The Rockefeller Foundation and now with more than 300 signatures, has placed global health and development at a historic crossroads.
和特朗普一样，科雷拉有时候也会走上电视或广播节目指名道姓批评记者；他的政府也一再将新闻组织诉上法庭。	Like Trump, Correa would sometimes go on television or radio programs to denounce journalists by name; and his government repeatedly took news organizations to court.
假以时日，这些打印店将取代售卖各种各样玩意的各种各样的店铺，在这些店铺中，有的玩意要几个月时间才有人问津。	Over time, these print shops will replace thousands of stores carrying millions of items, some of which sit around for months waiting to be bought.
生产率增长至少暂时处于低速挡，全球人口呈现出长期下降趋势，在这样的背景下，供给端，而不是需求端，才是发达经济体的真正约束。	With productivity growth at least temporarily stuck in low gear, and global population in long-term decline, the supply side, not lack of demand, is the real constraint in advanced economies.
为避免将相互间分歧公之于众的决议或措施，世界大国已经习惯于组织世界范围的会议及讨论，重新恢复了以共识为基础的决策机制。	In an effort to avoid resolutions or measures that expose their disagreements, the world’s great powers have adopted the habit of organizing worldwide debates and conferences that revert to decision-making by consensus.
早在今年6月恩格尔就推出了《朝鲜核基线法案 》 ， 该法案将要求白宫报告朝鲜核计划的进展状况，并为继续谈判提供一条进展“基线 ” 。	Back in June, Engel introduced the North Korea Nuclear Baseline Act, which would require the White House to report on the status of North Korea’s nuclear program and provide a “baseline” of progress for continued talks.
结果是肥胖率高达33.7 % ， 毫无疑问位居经合组织国家榜首，并由此带来非传染性疾病等巨大的不良后果。	The result is an obesity rate of 33.7%, the highest by far in the OECD, with enormous adverse consequences for non-communicable diseases.
长期失业占总失业的36%左右，低于2011年3月时的46 % ， 但仍比30年前所录得的前期峰值26%高得多。	The long-term unemployed account for about 36% of total unemployment, down from nearly 46% in March 2011 but still far above the previous peak of 26% reached 30 years ago.
自1990年代中期以来，公共养老金，医疗保健和其他福利的正式合并强制缴费率已经很高 — — 相当于工资数额的50％以上，也高于经合组织国家的费率中位数。	Since the mid-1990s, the combined mandatory contribution rate for public pensions, medical care, and other benefits has officially been very high – about 50% over the wage bill, which is higher than the median contribution rate in OECD countries.
事实上，尽管怀有良好初衷的立法者和非政府组织做出了很大的努力，但每天仍有成千上万吨塑料废物进入环境，特别是海洋。	The fact is that, despite the best efforts of well-intentioned lawmakers and nongovernmental organizations, thousands of tons of plastic waste are still entering the environment, particularly the oceans, every day.
至少在民主社会，应当向公众解释清楚这样的政策，而疾病分类，由于它应用于公共政策中的诸多职能，也应该如此。	At least in democratic societies, such policies should be accountable to the public, and the classification of diseases, since it serves many of the functions of public policy should be no different.
也许更重要的是，我们发现绿色收入较高的企业，股市估值（市盈率）也较高，即使它们当前权益回报率要低于它们的非绿色同行。	Perhaps more important, we found that firms with a higher share of green revenues have higher stock-market valuations (price-to-earnings ratios), even if their current return on equity is lower than that of their non-green peers.
换言之，中国必须面对由于过去地方计划及决策失误而已经发生的成本（经济学称其为沉淀成本，因为我们不能改变历史 ） ， 不能继续指望靠官僚系统的干预来粉饰有缺陷及不可持续的项目。	In other words, China must confront the sunk costs of bad local-planning decisions.
实际上，对罗雅尔和萨尔科奇强烈保留挥之不去也就解释了第三候选人的民意为何扶摇直上。 此人是传统中间派人物，亲欧洲的政客贝胡。	In fact, the persistence of strong reservations about both Royal and Sarkozy helps explain the surge in popularity for a third candidate, Francois Bayrou, a traditional centrist, pro-European politician.
在伊朗国内，温和力量 — — 包括改革派、异见分子和公民社会活动家等 — — 所组成的强大联盟长期以来一直要求采取积极参与的对外政策。	Within Iran, a powerful coalition of moderate forces – ranging from reformists and dissidents to civil-society actors – has long advocated for a more engaged foreign policy.

我们知道，欧元区的结果鼓励分化而非趋同：随着资本和人才离开受危机影响的经济体，这些国家更加无法偿还债务。	We know that the structure of the eurozone encourages divergence, not convergence: as capital and talented people leave crisis-hit economies, these countries become less able to repay their debts.
公司税率将从35%下降到20 % ， 资本利得（投资收益）税也将下调，不动产税将取消，还有其他有利于富人的变动。	It would lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, reduce the tax on capital gains (investment profits), eliminate the estate tax, and introduce other changes that benefit the wealthy.
发自莫斯科 — — 最近，萦绕在我脑际的总是我的曾祖父尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫，我猜首先挑动我思绪的也许是他同尼克松总统的所谓“厨房辩论”刚好过去了整整50周年。	MOSCOW – My great-grandfather, Nikita Khrushchev, has been on my mind recently. I suppose it was the 50th anniversary of the so-called “kitchen debate” which he held with Richard Nixon that first triggered my memories.
如果真主党对慕尼耶之死实施报复，或者只是像 2006 年那样在遭到挑衅之后本能地予以反击，都有可能在转瞬之间点燃黎巴嫩前线的战火。	The Lebanese front may ignite if Hezbollah seeks to avenge Mughniyah’s death, or simply as a result of a knee-jerk reaction to a provocation, as in 2006.
2005年上一次购买力平价计算时，所使用的方法是选取15个最贫困国家的国家贫困线，计算它们的平均值作为全球贫困线。	In 2005, when the previous round of purchasing power parities was estimated, the method used was to take the national poverty lines of the 15 poorest countries, compute their average, and treat that as the global line.
诚然，此结果代表着一个既震惊又历史性的失败：在第五共和国时期，戴高乐，密特朗，雅克. 希拉克这三位在任总统都连任两届。	Indeed, the result represents a stunning and historic defeat: during the Fifth Republic, three sitting presidents – Charles de Gaulle, Mitterrand, and Jacques Chirac – have been reelected after their first term in office.
在最近对这个拥有130万人口的热带岛国的访问中，我有机会观察了毛里求斯所实现的飞跃 — — 这些成就在美国以及世界其他地方看来简直有点不可思议。	In a recent visit to this tropical archipelago of 1.3 million people, I had a chance to see some of the leaps Mauritius has taken – accomplishments that can seem bewildering in light of the debate in the US and elsewhere.
换成是不久前，媒体会用这样的标题攻讦两人 ： 《 教授们的经济学是“优 ” ， 但政治不及格 》 。	Not long from now, both men will most likely provoke headlines such as the following: “Professors Earn ‘A’ in Economics, but Flunk Politics.”
举例来讲，分离主义者可以放弃单方面独立宣言，以换取进行有关宪法改革的谈判，从而促成西班牙走向联邦制。	For example, the separatists could renounce a unilateral declaration of independence in exchange for talks on constitutional reforms that would move Spain in a federal direction.
1996至2001年塔利班统治阿富汗时支持疫苗接种工作，现在态度也并未改变；最新的塔利班声明敦促圣战者为小儿麻痹工作人员提供“一切必要的支持 ” 。	When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, from 1996 to 2001, it supported the vaccination effort, and indeed it continues to do so; a recent Taliban statement urged its Mujahedeen to provide polio workers with “all necessary support.”
对此的解释包括政府干预或一种 新型的工业组织，及新的制造者们对专利的侵犯。 他们仿制他国产品并阻断进口产品参与国内的市场竞争。	Such explanations included government intervention or a new sort of industrial organization, and unfair patent infringements by the new producers who copied products and then blocked off their own markets from import competition.
旗帜也许是较能激发共同命运感的符号，但我们大多数人不会随身携带旗帜，许多人也不会随便展示旗帜，除非是遇到大型运动会这样的场合；旗帜的起源 — — 战斗标志 — — 带有令人不安的侵略性。	Flags may be a more inspiring symbol of common destiny, but most of us do not carry them around, and many people never display them, except perhaps at major sports events; their origin, rooted in battle standards, can seem uncomfortably aggressive.
极权统治者不但学会了如何在本国社会中扭曲和控制信息流，还学会了如何混淆他国人民的视听，甚至破坏此前运转良好的民主。	Authoritarian rulers have figured out not only how to distort and control the flow of information within their own societies, but also how to confuse people in other countries and perhaps even disrupt previously well-functioning democracies.
托洛茨基提醒我们独裁政权往往在最终倒台前仍被视为坚不可摧，不过一旦推翻后其崩溃却被视为无可避免的结局。	Dictatorships are regarded as indestructible before they fall, Trotsky reminds us, but their demise is viewed as inevitable once they are toppled.
如果我们从现在开始投资于改善营养，就能为世界各地的女孩和妇女确保未来一百年甚至更长时间前景更加光明。	If we invest in better nutrition now, we can ensure a brighter future for girls and women everywhere – for the next hundred years and beyond.
印度总统是穆斯林，总理是锡客人，外长是印度教徒，而其执政的国大党主席则是出生在国外的基督徒。 正如中共在过去二十年中所做的一样，印度的成功毫不逊色。	With a Muslim President, a Sikh Prime Minister, a Hindu Foreign Minister, and a foreign-born Christian President of its ruling Congress party, India is as remarkable a success story as the twenty-year boom that China’s Communist Party has delivered.
英国人只能希望欧盟领导人愿意表现出一点同情心：毕竟，选民所传达的一个明确信息就是他们对现有的脱欧后替代方案缺乏信心。	Britons will have to hope that EU leaders are willing to show some compassion: after all, the one clear message from voters was their lack of confidence in the alternatives on offer.
相反，足够多的选民开始理解，在这个愤怒中 — — 在其发言人及其表达愤怒的用词中 — — 隐含着对共和，对民主，对民族基本价值的威胁。	On the contrary, a sufficient number of voters came to understand that in that very anger – in its spokespeople and in the words used to express it – lurked a threat to the republic, to democracy, and to the nation’s fundamental values.
在类似的气候中极端降雨也将变得频繁而且高强度，这是基于另一个简单的物理事实：暖空气可以储藏更多水分。	Extreme rainfall events will also become more frequent and intense in a warmer climate, owing to another simple fact of physics: warm air can hold more moisture.
英国的欧洲伙伴期待卡梅伦安排好必须现在就开启的争论，以使真正强大的欧盟 — — 一个可以面对未来和未来挑战的欧盟 — — 得以实现。	The UK’s European partners expect Cameron to frame the debate that must now begin if a truly stronger EU – one that can face up to its future and its future challenges – is to emerge.
所有措施都不是意在减少雇工监管，而是可以归结为官员决定国家资金和公司补贴的去向，替公司决定投资项目。	Apart from promises to reduce employment regulation, all of the new measures boil down to officials directing state money and subsidies to companies and projects of their choosing.
3月份，英国、德国、韩国、澳大利亚和其他国家出人意料地决定加入亚投行，这让很多媒体将此报道为（部分拜美国决策者的失策所赐）美国盟友集体投敌。	When the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, Australia, and others unexpectedly decided in March to join the AIIB, it was widely reported (partly because of missteps by US policymakers) as a mass defection of US allies to a rival’s party.
很难想象不喜欢媒体的特朗普会主持这样的场合，更不用说与夫人梅拉尼娅（Melania）一起笔挺地站着迎候每一位访客、就像巴拉克和米歇尔·奥巴马八年来所做的那样了。	It’s difficult to imagine that Trump, no fan of the press, would host such an event, much less stand stoically with his wife Melania greeting each individual guest, as Barack and Michelle Obama did for eight years.
2002年，小布什政府对进口钢材征收高额关税，但因为世贸组织纠纷解决机制委员会做出不利于美国的裁定后有所收手。	Back in 2002, President George W. Bush’s administration imposed steep tariffs on steel imports, but relented when a World Trade Organization dispute-resolution panel ruled against the US.
许多人并没有买到较穷时支出、较富时储蓄的能力，而是买到了暂时不必与其他家庭成员讨论“不愉快的财务紧缩”的机会。	Many are not buying the ability to spend when they are poor and save when they are rich, but instead appear to be buying postponement of the “unpleasant financial retrenchment” talk with the other members of their household.
2008年由美国房地产市场崩盘所引发的全球金融危机为我们带来了重要的教训，表明了金融体系在面对住房市场崩溃时的脆弱性。	The global financial crisis that the US housing-market crash triggered in 2008 carried important lessons about how fragile the financial system is in the face of a housing-market collapse.
法国社会党从来没有经历过天主教的现代化改革，也没有过巴特戈德斯贝格纲领（德国社民党曾在1959把它称为马克思主义的最后遗迹 ） 。	The French Socialist Party never had its “aggiornamento” or “Bad Godesberg” (where the German SPD in 1959 renounced its last vestiges of Marxism).
这些激励措施的代价将会是温和的而效益将会是巨大的，而且可以被用来保护穷人并将气候变化的负担转移到那些有能力支付的人身上。	Those incentives will come at modest cost and huge benefit, and they can be designed to protect the poor and shift the climate-change burden to those who can afford it.
也许更重要的是，这将有利于所有的乌克兰公民 — — 包括那些持少数族裔语言的人们 — — 更加具备完全融入乌克兰社会的能力。	Perhaps more important, it will benefit all Ukrainian citizens, including minority-language speakers, who will be better equipped to integrate fully into Ukrainian society.
他们把从共产主义的过渡比作约翰·洛克所说的自然状态，于是就认定通过任用亲信、裙带关系和私下交易所获得的财产是来自洛克哲学的自由王国。	They liken the transition from communism to the state of nature described by John Locke. So they imagine the property rights acquired through cronyism, nepotism, and backroom dealing as somehow emerging from a Lockean realm of freedom.
例如，近几个月，国际刑警组织已经标记了像Hamza Yalçin、Fikret Huseynli、 Narzullo Akhunzhonov和Can Dündar这样的记者，他们仅仅因为忠于职守而遭到政府的通缉。	For example, in recent months, journalists like Hamza Yalçin, Fikret Huseynli, Narzullo Akhunzhonov, and Can Dündar, targeted by their governments for simply doing their jobs, have all been flagged by Interpol.
在欧洲的高税负经济体中，更自觉的纳税行为或者选择性财政增收手段只能在不削弱增长的情况下获取少量的额外税收收入。	In Europe’s highly taxed economies, better tax compliance or selective revenue measures can produce only a small amount of additional tax revenue without undermining growth.
对经济决策者来说，谚语中的艳阳天已经到来：专家们纷纷预测给力的增长，因此，这是检查我们是否为下一次衰退做好准备的最好时候。	For economic policymakers, the proverbial sunny day has arrived: with experts forecasting strong growth, now is the best time to check whether we are prepared for the next recession.
德国是UNRWA的第三大出资人，其外交部长赫科·马斯（Heiko Maas）最近宣布德国政府“最近准备大幅增加拨款 ” 。	In Germany, UNRWA’s third-largest funder, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas recently announced that the government is “currently preparing to provide an additional amount of significant funds” to the organization.
幸运的是，鉴于欧盟对多数普通乌克兰民众的吸引力，纯粹的现实主义仍有希望说服亚努科维奇和乌克兰的执政精英回心转意并允许签署入盟协议。	Fortunately, given the Union’s attraction for most ordinary Ukrainians, there is still hope that simple realism will persuade Yanukovych and Ukraine’s ruling elite to return to a path that would allow for the association agreement to be signed.
引力的弱性质导致我们很难测量它的量子效应；因此，我们无法获得实验数据指导物理学家研究这一迷失的理论。	Gravity's weakness makes it very difficult to measure its quantum effects; as a result, we have no experimental data to guide theoretical physicists in the development of the missing theory.
比如，在美国发生于二十世纪八十年代后期的房地产泡沫破裂中，许多发放抵押贷款的银行（储蓄和住宅贷款金融机构）彻底破产，从而引发了1990和1991年间的银行危机、信贷紧缩和经济衰退。	For example, during the housing bust in the United States in the late 1980’s, many banks that were mortgage lenders (the Savings ampamp; Loans Associations) went belly up, leading to a banking crisis, a credit crunch, and a recession in 1990-1991.
事实上，尽管经历了法雅德主义的崛起，巴勒斯坦民族运动仍然小心翼翼地避免背叛其真正的合法性来源：那就是难民和剥夺。	Indeed, despite of the rise of Fayaadism, the Palestinian national movement will be careful not to betray its real sources of legitimacy: the ethos of dispossession and the refugee.
而且，在2月召开的20国集团财长会议上，据报道英格兰银行行长马克·卡尼将上述政策称之为“终极零和游戏 。 ”	And, at the February G-20 finance ministers meeting, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney reportedly called these policies “ultimately a zero-sum game.”
但是，专家们一致认为，政府的贫困指标不能正确反映所取得的进步，因为官方统计数字只关注现金收入，而忽略了几乎全部政府转移支付。	Experts agree, however, that the government’s poverty measure doesn’t correctly reflect the progress that has occurred, because official statistics focus only on cash income and ignore almost all of the government’s transfer payments.
其中一个原因源自于某些初始条件 — — 这些条件在扩大了对峙和冲突范围的同时限制了可以从贸易增加中取得的直接受益。	One reason is rooted in initial conditions that limit direct gains from increased trade while widening the scope for tension and conflict.
光有导弹和坦克不能带来和平，但如果再加上对战败者积极伸出援手的文明力量，就能在伊拉克和中东其它地区���现真正的民主。	Missiles and tanks alone cannot bring democracy, but coupled with the civil power of sensitive help for the defeated, democracy can be adapted to Iraq and the rest of the Middle East.
发自巴黎 — — 为了解答在资本主义民主体制下究竟能把国家规模和控制力推到何种限度的问题，当前的法国经济比以往任何时候都更处于全球辩论的核心。	PARIS – More than ever, the French economy is at the center of the global debate about how far one can push the limits of state size and control in a capitalist democracy.
但是，随着成员国逐渐变得民主，巩固公众支持也变得越来越重要 — — 这意味着东盟领导人必须努力以更有效的方式与民众沟通一体化的好处。	But, as member countries have become more democratic, solidifying public support has become increasingly important – meaning that ASEAN leaders must work to communicate the benefits of integration more effectively.
这标志着回归前威斯特伐利亚的语言/宗教和宗派团结时代，当时的沙皇俄国以所有斯拉夫民族的保护人自居并据此行动。	This marks a return to a pre-Westphalian world of linguistic, religious, and sectarian solidarity, of the sort Czarist Russia practiced when it regarded itself as the protector of all Slavs.
特朗普和国会共和党人一直在执掌一个相对强大的经济体，虽然他们很高兴地自称是自己的，但其实是从前总统奥巴马那里继承来的。	And Trump and congressional Republicans have been presiding over a relatively strong economy, which they inherited from former President Barack Obama, but are happy to claim as their own.
此外大部分风险（即便购买了保险）依然要由日本来承担，而非有效地分散到了外国投资者手中，因此日本依然要独自承受损失。	Moreover, much of that risk, even if insured, continues to be borne in Japan, rather than being spread effectively to foreign investors, so Japan is still alone in bearing the costs.
近几年来，农地产出频创新高，从2005—2006年的2.8亿吨增加到2013—2014年的2.63亿吨（预计值 ） 。	Farm output has been setting new records in recent years, having increased output from 208 million tons in 2005-2006 to an estimated 263 million tons in 2013-2014.
因为女性生殖器血吸虫病和淋巴丝虫病等疾病留下疤痕或遭到毁容的女性往往受到歧视，以至于她们无法结婚或者被配偶所抛弃。	Women who have been scarred or disfigured from diseases such as FGS and lymphatic filariasis are often stigmatized to the point that they are unable to marry or are abandoned by their spouses.
但尽管俄罗斯退休基金确实存在很大缺口，国家补贴占总整合预算的比例还不到10 % — —比每年石油价格波动导致的变化还要少。	But, while Russia’s pension fund does have a massive shortfall, state subsidies to it amount to less than 10% of the total consolidated budget – less than the fluctuation caused by changes in oil prices each year.
横行的腐败和日益剧烈的不平等，加上显而易见的环境恶化，正在让普通中国人 — — 特别是对改革寄予厚望的中产阶级 — — 日益清醒过来。	Rampant corruption and rising inequality, together with obvious environmental decay, are causing ordinary Chinese – especially the middle class, which once had high hopes for reform – to become increasingly disillusioned.
欧盟各国政府一直想要一个圆滑的委员会，但是现在的代价就是保护欧盟不受民族摩擦的“共同体方式”的灭亡。	EU governments have wanted a pliable Commission, but now the cost could be the death of the “community method” that protects the EU against national frictions.
在1971年举行的日本世界乒乓球锦标赛上，一位美国选手搭错了中国队的大巴，结果开启了日后的“乒乓外交 ” 。	At the 1971 World Table Tennis Championships in Japan, an American player hitched a ride on the Chinese team’s bus, inaugurating what became known as “ping-pong diplomacy.”
但几乎没有证据表明低利率推动了2012—2015年股票价格的继续攀升 — — 在此期间市场预期将会发生升息。	But there is little evidence that low interest rates have been behind the continued rise in equity prices from 2012 to 2015 – a period when markets were anticipating an interest-rate hike.
在另外5个研究项目中，科学家们在其中两个项目中发现更早发育成熟的发展中国家妇女身高变得更矮（另外三个项目并未测量身高 ） 。	In five other cases, scientists found women in developed countries maturing earlier, in two of them at smaller size (in the other three cases, size was not measured).
乌克兰幸运地拥有一个新政府，这个新政府更有决心也更加可能实施乌克兰公民和乌克兰外部支持者一直在大声要求的改革。	Ukraine is fortunate to have a new government that is more determined and more likely to deliver the reforms for which both its citizens and its outside supporters have been clamoring.
英国领导人必须认识到，当产业战略是为了提振退欧后的增长，那么也许需要在欧盟关税提高的前提下制定。 欧盟将仍然是英国的主要市场。	UK leaders must recognize that, where the strategy is aimed at strengthening post-Brexit growth, it will probably have to be set in the context of higher tariffs vis-à-vis the EU, which would remain Britain’s main market.
流通于欧元区的所有资金都产生于这五个国家，并随后大部分用于购买北欧成员国商品和资产以及偿还外国债务。	All the money circulating in the eurozone originated in these five countries and was then largely used to buy goods and assets in the northern member countries and redeem foreign debt taken from them.
但过于轻易地呼喊种族灭绝迅速贬低了这个词的价值，并将对持续灭绝采取对策的努力限制在对法律性质的纯粹辩论中。	Yet crying genocide too liberally quickly cheapens its value, entangling efforts to respond to ongoing exterminations in debates about their precise legal nature.
在两起事件中，在面对资本外流时试图维护固定汇率的举措才是主要原因，而2001年二月土耳其货币崩盘前一年的情况也是如此。	In both cases, the effort to defend a fixed exchange rate in the face of capital-flow reversals was a major factor, as was true in Turkey in the year prior to its currency collapse in February 2001.
增加对同伴行动网络的投资可能有助于加强领导力和执行能力 — — 这对于扩大世界各地的学习机会至关重要，这是联合国可持续发展目标的一个关键目标。	Increasing investment in peer action networks could help to bolster leadership and implementation capacity – critical to expand learning opportunities around the world, a key objective of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
候选人表现如何，也不会根据其观点是否具有实质内容决定，而是根据其演说、其肢体语言、其面部表情、其不经意的叹息、微笑、冷嘲和无意中的眼部动作决定。	And the candidates’ performances are scrutinized less on the substance of their arguments than on their presentation, body language, facial tics, unguarded sighs, smiles, sneers, and inadvertent eye rolling.
这就是为什么在今后几年中消除消费偏见必定是最优先事项，也需要一些变革来确保电动车的使用和销售量继续增长。	That is why addressing consumption bias must be the highest priority over the next few years. Several changes are needed to ensure that growth in EV usage and sales continues.
但这也衍生出另一种更有害的观念：既然阿罗-德布鲁模型之外的思考变得更现实也因此更为复杂，那就不适用于课堂教学。	But it has become burdened with another, more pernicious notion: as departures from the Arrow-Debreu model become more realistic, and thus more complex, they become less suitable for the classroom.
尽管如此，如果特朗普和金正恩的峰会要想取得持续的效果，断不能仅仅试图破事朝鲜去核化、而要寻求让朝鲜向世界敞开国门的更广泛的战略协议。	Nonetheless, if Trump’s summit with Kim is to have a lasting impact, it is essential to move beyond simply trying to force North Korea to denuclearize and pursue a broader strategic deal aimed at opening the North to the world.
米尔·侯赛因·穆萨维就是这样一个人。 1981年，他被后来的最高领袖阿亚图拉·哈梅内伊挑选成为总理。	Mir-Hossein Mousavi, chosen by the late Ayatollah Khomeini to be prime minister in 1981, was such a figure.
即使是欧洲最大的经济体德国也经历了2010年以来最大规模的房地产热潮，城市住宅平均价格上升了超过1/3 — — 大城市则升了将近一半。	Even Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has been experiencing a massive property boom since 2010, with average urban property prices having risen by more than one-third – and by nearly half in large cities.
无数的穆斯林学者都从几个世纪以来的宗教法律中引经据典，高声质问恐怖分子对其自杀式炸弹和对平民的攻击的辩护。	Numerous Muslim scholars have raised their voices to challenge the terrorists’ defense of suicide bombings or attacks on civilians, offering long citations from centuries of religious jurisprudence.
可悲的是，在目前看来，自从约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯解释了由于市场需求的不足，经济是如何受制于失业率的理论之后，宏观经济学家们并没有什么新的贡献。	Sadly, in view of today’s needs, macroeconomists have made little progress on policy since John Maynard Keynes explained how economies could get stuck in unemployment due to deficient aggregate demand.
今天，俄罗斯利用同样的逻辑来为与阿富汗塔利班的合作寻找理由，它希望塔利班势力继续打击由美国支持的动荡的喀布尔政府。	Today, Russia is using the same logic to justify its cooperation with the Afghan Taliban, which it wants to keep fighting the unstable US-backed government in Kabul.
然而，四个月以后，围困仍未解除，被迫下台的哈马斯的部长们（如前外交部长Mahmoud Zahhar和内政部长Said Siyam）深感受骗，正要求官复原职。	Four months later, however, the siege has not been lifted, and the Hamas ministers (such as former Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahhar and Interior Minster Said Siyam) who were forced out now feel betrayed and are demanding their jobs back.
“尽可能地活得长的意图未必是最好的意图 ， ” 作家迪帕克·乔普拉（Deepak Chopra）曾经观察道 ， “ 因为数量和质量不是一回事 。 ”	“The intention to live as long as possible isn’t one of the mind’s best intentions,” the author Deepak Chopra once observed, “because quantity isn’t the same as quality.”
主动向监管部门汇报的比率十分低 — — 大约只有1 % — —并且在许多国家中，保持不断的监测处于消极态势。	Spontaneous reporting rates to regulatory agencies are low – approximately 1% – and ongoing monitoring is passive in many countries.
这种损失，或者仅仅是对这种损失的担心，将使套利交易人被迫变卖其在美国市场的资产取偿还其在日本的贷款，从而很有可能会在全球蔓延。	Such losses, or just the thought of them, have the potential to trigger global contagion as carry traders close positions in US markets to repay loans in Japan.
同样，尽管福克斯由于对抗议者和破坏性的极端反对力量姑息迁就而饱受批评，但他从未进行过令那些嗜血的前任闻名遐尔的血腥镇压。	Likewise, while Fox can be criticized for not clamping down on protesters and a disruptive, extremist opposition, he never resorted to the bloody repression for which most of his predecessors came to be known.
但美元作为国际锚的作用正在减弱，因为其他新兴市场国家越来越不满足于美联储的近零利率政策 — — 这导致“热”资本从美国涌入。	But the dollar’s role as international anchor is beginning to falter, as emerging markets everywhere grow increasingly frustrated by the Fed’s near-zero interest-rate policy, which has caused a flood of “hot” capital inflows from the US.
未来几年，随着剩余失业人口得到吸收，以及年长劳动者重新加入劳动力市场的长期趋势维持下去，平均增长率有望继续维持在2%以上，但未利用劳动力最终会耗尽。	While the average growth rate might remain above 2% for the next few years, as the remaining unemployed are absorbed and the long-term trend of older workers rejoining the labor market continues, the pool of unused labor will eventually be exhausted.
以他的长期盟友，精锐部队第一装甲师师长阿里·穆赫辛·阿赫玛尔将军为首的一众军队，政府和外交官员纷纷倒戈，使其统治当即陷入危机之中。	A wave of military, government, and diplomatic defections, led by his long-time ally First Armored Brigade Commander General Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, rocked his regime.
公平、开放和透明是让双方正确有效地评估未来收益的关键，当然也是让私人部门和其他行动方继续贡献创新性方案的关键。	Fairness, openness, and transparency are vital to enable both sides to appraise the prospective gains accurately and efficiently, not to mention to allow the private sector and other parties to contribute innovative solutions.
但令人吃惊的是，即便这些政策获得了如此高的成就和支持度，选民们却选出了令许多智利人至今担心会动摇这一政策的总统和议会。	So, given the success and popularity of these policies, it is surprising that Chile’s voters have elected a president and a parliament that many Chileans now fear could put this approach at risk.
事实上，尽管比一些美国州低（如加州的公司税率高达40 % ） ，但日本公司税率高于德国（25 % ） 、中国（24 % ） 、韩国（24 % ） 、英国（24 % ） 和新加坡（17 % ） 。	Indeed, while it remains lower than in some US states (California’s rate, for example, stands at 40%), it exceeds the rates applied in Germany (25%), China (24%), South Korea (24%), the United Kingdom (24%), and Singapore (17%).
传承着先知穆罕穆德血脉的摩洛哥与约旦王室、保管着圣城麦加和麦地那的沙特阿拉伯，其统治者经由这种直接的伊斯兰纽带获得了某种合法性。	Being descendants of the Prophet, as in Morocco and Jordan, or having custodianship of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, as in Saudi Arabia, bestows a legitimacy on the countries’ rulers that is directly linked to Islam.
拉美和加勒比地区正在采取统一行动帮助降低全球排放，如果有来自发达国家的资金和技术转移，我们可以做更多的事。	Latin America and the Caribbean are taking concerted action to help bringing down global emissions and could do much more with funding and technology transfers from developed countries.
他们通过煽动对“他人 ” — —包括难民、穆斯林或外国恐怖分子 — — 的恐惧并承诺以武力确保安全来攫取权力。	They win power by stoking fear of the “other” – refugees, Muslims, or foreign terrorists – and promising to establish security through force.
毕竟，意大利人、德国人和法国人工作时间相对较短，但工作努力且出色，因此拥有很高的单位时间生产率和工资 — — 比美国和英国都要高。	After all, the Italians, Germans, and French work hard and well over a relatively small number of hours, resulting in high hourly productivity and wages – higher than in the United States and the United Kingdom.
在可能导致物价上升并在某些情况下引发更严重就业不安全感的整个报复阶段，政府都得将本已分裂的美国公众拧成一股绳。	A divided US public will need to be kept on board throughout the retaliatory phase, which will lead to higher prices and, in some cases, greater job insecurity.
2009~2014年间，发展中国家总共获得了2.2万亿美元的净资本流入，部分原因是发达经济体的量化宽松政策在令利率处于近零水平。	During 2009-2014, developing countries collectively received a net capital inflow of $2.2 trillion, partly owing to quantitative easing in advanced economies, which pushed interest rates there to near zero.
但这恰恰是问题所在，尽管特朗普政府声嘶力竭地呼喊“美国优先 ” ， 但美国很可能会发现自己已经在贸易战中落了下风。	But that’s precisely the problem. Notwithstanding the Trump administration’s cri de coeur of America First, the US could well find itself on the losing side of a trade war.
amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 目前研究的不同机器可以在网站www.roadabletimes.com找到。	The variety of machines currently under study is accessible at www.roadabletimes.com .
阻止我们观察这些股票市场回报率问题的障碍永远也不会再出现了，但是如果以为那样的问题再也不可能重新发生，那就错了。	The particular problems that prevented us from observing the returns on these stock markets will never be repeated, but it is wrong to assume that problems of that scale will not recur.
通过将这项任务交给有独裁倾向的领导者，他们授权这位领袖单纯用自己的亲信取代主流政客来扩充沼泽而不是放干它。	And, by delegating this task to a leader with authoritarian tendencies, they empower him to repopulate the swamp rather than draining it – to simply replace the mainstream’s alligators with his own.
但是最近的中央经济工作会议上没有在这一战略背景下考虑增长放缓问题，而是把相当大的权重放“积极财政政策和稳健货币政策”的宏观稳定责任之上。	But the recent Work Conference failed to consider China’s growth slowdown in this strategic context, placing considerable weight instead on the macro-stabilization imperatives of “proactive fiscal and prudent monetary policies.”
乌干达的进口商们看到这一转变，就投资在该国建立新的碾米厂，扩大了就业并在农户的产量上造成竞争从而改善价格。	Uganda’s importers, seeing the shift, have invested in new mills in the country, expanding employment and creating competition for farmers’ output, improving prices.
今年，世界上最丰富、最复杂的生态系统之一、澳大利亚大堡礁世界遗产区死去近四分之一的珊瑚，是有记录以来规模最严重的珊瑚漂白。	Almost one-quarter of the coral in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area – one of the world’s richest and most complex ecosystems – has died this year, in the worst mass coral bleaching in recorded history.
比如，多德-弗兰克立法明确规定，所有大型金融机构都应该写好有意义的“生前遗嘱 ” — —写清楚如若它们再次出现资不抵债情形应该如何倒闭而不进行任何形式的援助。	For example, the Dodd-Frank legislation specifies that all large financial institutions should draw up meaningful “living wills” – specifying how they could be allowed to fail, unencumbered by any kind of bailout, if they again became insolvent.
更晚近一些，已故诺贝尔物理学奖获得者费曼这样描述他所发现的物理学新定律 ： “ 你可以从它的美和简单中认识真理 。 ”	More recently, the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, describing his discovery of new laws of physics, declared, “You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity.”
此外，教育体系应该注重鼓励加大对创新和冒险的开放程度 — — 这与公共部门卵翼下的体系所产生的态度截然不同。	Moreover, education systems should focus on encouraging greater openness to innovation and risk-taking – a significant departure from the attitudes reproduced under a system of public-sector patronage.
最近各市政府和州立法机关之间就围绕法律优先适用原则展开了几场法律斗争 — — 该原则认为地方法律应服从于州法律。	There have been several legal fights recently between city governments and state legislatures over the principle of preemption, which holds that state laws override local laws.
最基本的是，鼓励多样化 — — 机构、拨款机制、研究方法等方面的多样化 — — 对于阻止扼杀创新的一致性至关重要。	Most fundamental, encouraging diversity – of institutions, funding mechanisms, and research approaches – is vital to prevent innovation-killing conformity.
诚然，委内瑞拉社会的很大一部分认为自己不属于该国养尊处优的精英意识和与世隔绝的治理安排之内，并对这两者深恶痛绝；但朝气蓬勃的中产阶级占据着近一半的人口。	To be sure, large swaths of Venezuelan society rightly felt excluded from the country’s cozy elite consensus and insular governing arrangements, and resented it immensely; but an aspiring middle class comprised roughly half the population.
那些在海湾国家当移民的孟加拉国工人带着激进的瓦哈比（Wahhabi）和Salafi所教授的思想回到祖国，愈加地煽风点火。	Bangladeshi migrant workers in the Gulf States who return home imbued with radical Wahhabi and Salafi teachings fan the fires even more.
从统计数据上看，通过高税收和国家调剂实现的财富再分配体现了共和党平等与社会团结（友善）的美好理想，产生了良好的社会效果。	On paper, wealth redistribution through high taxes and state transfers, reflecting Republican ideals of equality and social cohesion ( fraternité ), has brought good results.
这一巨型地区协议可能还有一个与世贸组织共有的优势：更多的参与方可以淡化主导国的威权，从而阻止其强迫谈判伙伴屈从于不平衡的协定。	The mega-regional approach may have one more advantage, shared with the WTO: the involvement of more parties can dilute the authority of a major country and thus limit its ability to strong-arm its negotiating partners into an unbalanced agreement.
以色列的目标 — — 成为一个永久的犹太人的、民主的、安全的、繁荣的国家 — — 因为无期限的占领和人口现实的变化而受到威胁。	Israel’s objective of being a permanent Jewish, democratic, secure, and prosperous country is threatened by open-ended occupation and evolving demographic realities.
最后，德国、西班牙、意大利和一些北欧国家出于国内政治原因要求对公开违抗欧盟机构和紧缩要求的希腊政客和选民给予形式羞辱（ritual humiliation ） 。	Finally, Germany, Spain, Italy, and several northern European countries required, for domestic political reasons, a ritual humiliation of radical Greek politicians and voters who openly defied EU institutions and austerity demands.
过去50年韩国的经济表现主要归功于良好的基本面，包括高储蓄率、雄厚的人力资本、健全的制度和审慎的财政和货币管理政策。	South Korea’s economic performance over the last 50 years was attributed largely to good fundamentals, including a high savings rate, strong human capital, sound institutions, and prudent fiscal and monetary management.
例如我希望将设备费用预提固定下来，扩大个人所得税基数，或以较低的所得税税率去充分整合企业税和个人所得税，但这样的法案是过不了国会的。	For example, I would welcome making the equipment-expensing provision permanent, broadening the personal-income-tax base, or fully integrating corporate and personal taxes at lower income-tax rates. But such a bill would not pass Congress.
此外，巨大的潜在收益（高达亿万美元级别）与低廉的直接成本 — — 全部部署也只需要几十亿美元 — — 对比鲜明。	Moreover, the large potential upside, measured in trillions of dollars, contrasts with low direct costs – in the single-digit billions for full-scale deployment.
尽管南亚取得了长足的进步，但仍有四分之一儿童无法获得麻疹和肝炎疫苗，肺炎和脑膜炎等主要致死疾病的为接种人数更高。	Despite the region’s progress, one in four children remain unprotected against diseases like measles and hepatitis, and the figures are even higher for major killers such as pneumonia and meningitis.

英国通过掠夺、征没和赤裸裸的偷盗毁灭了印度 — — 所有这些都是以深深的种族主义和不道德的犬儒主义精神完成的。	Britain destroyed India through looting, expropriation, and outright theft – all conducted in a spirit of deep racism and amoral cynicism.
自20世纪80年代以来，中国经历了前所未有的经济增长，其动力来自充足的低成本劳动力、高储蓄和投资率、重大市场改革、外向型政策以及审慎的宏观管理。	Since the 1980s, China has experienced unprecedented economic growth, fueled by abundant low-cost labor, high saving and investment rates, substantial market reforms, outward-oriented policies, and prudent macroeconomic management.
中国已经表明它希望通过扮演一个支持性的伙伴 角色(至少在经济领域) 在发展中国家中 (当然也在亚洲) 发挥影响力。	China has shown that it wants to be influential in the developing world – and certainly in Asia – by playing the role of a supportive partner, at least in the economic realm.
扩大获取培训和认证的机会将有助于各国利用这些进步并确保实现更公平的增长，并为工人提供处理新工作所需的技能。	Improving access to training and certification would help countries capitalize on these advances and ensure more equitable growth, by giving workers the skills needed to handle the new jobs.
希腊从未拥有能让它曾经如此富裕的生产结构：其收入是用大量借款推起来的，而这笔借款本来可以用于升级其生产力。	Greece never had the productive structure to be as rich as it was: its income was inflated by massive amounts of borrowed money that was not used to upgrade its productive capacity.
此后，金融部门将全部精力都花在了设计能规避价格波动、将私人债务转化为可交易金融证券并进入投机市场的金融工具上。	The financial sector has since made every effort to design instruments that protect against price fluctuations, to transform private debt into tradable financial securities, and to gain access to speculative markets.
在对希腊的贷款中，IMF好像是在借钱给准国家单位（如省级或市级政府 ） ， 而没有要求国家当局做出偿付担保。	In lending to Greece, it is as if the Fund had lent to a sub-national unit, such as a provincial or city government, without insisting on repayment guarantees from the national authorities.
查尼报告估计大气中二氧化碳含量翻倍将使地球升温约3摄氏度 — — 该预测的准确性今天已经得到了证实。	Charney’s report estimated that doubling the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would warm the earth by about 3° Celsius – a number that is well confirmed today.

投资于电力交通和基础设施 — — 包括电气化公共交通、充电站和共享电动车计划 — — 对发展有利无害。	Investing in electric mobility and infrastructure – including electrified public transportation, charging stations, and electric car-sharing programs – will help, not hurt, development.
德国加强了已然十分严格的劳动力市场监管、追求错误的能源政策、颠覆了养老金改革，它正在自挖当前经济局面的脚跟，朝问题国家迈进。	By reinforcing already-strict labor-market regulation, pursuing a misguided energy policy, and reversing pension reform, Germany is undermining its current economic position and will move in the direction of problem countries.
但是，我出席了17次会议中的16次（错过了第一届 ） ， 我的感觉是2016年中国发展论坛对于中国所面临的艰巨经济挑战来说具有特别丰富的战略含义。	But, having attended 16 of the 17 meetings (I missed the first one), my sense is that CDF 2016 was especially rich in its strategic implications for China’s daunting economic challenges.
换句话说，目前希腊能够为其当前水平的消费和投资（包括政府和私人支出）融资，不需要依靠来自世界其他部分的资本流入。	Stated differently, Greece is now able to finance its current level of consumption and investment, including government and private spending, without relying on capital inflows from the rest of the world.
我们需要源于明确全球目标的一种全新政治：那就是通过履行巴黎气候协定、保护生物多样性和减少每年致死数百万人的污染，保护全球民众在安全的环境中生活。	We need a new kind of politics that starts with a clear global goal: environmental safety for the planet’s people, by fulfilling the Paris climate agreement, protecting biodiversity, and cutting pollution, which kills millions each year.
低价值、劳动密集型商品流（如服装）展全球流的比重在下降，而研发密集型商品流（如制药和商业服务）份额在增加。	Flows of low-value, labor-intensive goods like apparel are declining as a share of global flows, while flows of R&D-intensive products, such as pharmaceuticals and business services, are gaining share.
但是，埃及总理詹祖里透露，该国的阿拉伯“同胞”承诺给予埃及105亿美元贷款和原著，但只兑现了10亿美元。	But, according to Egypt’s prime minister, Kamal al-Ganzouri, the country’s Arab “brethren” have delivered only $1 billion of the $10.5 billion in aid and loans that they promised.
5月19日，该州的选民在一次特别选举中，否决了一系列为达到预算平衡所需要的增加税收和削减支出的方案。	On May 19, the state’s voters, in a special election, rejected an array of tax increases and spending cuts required to balance its budget.
尽管沙特的统治家族 — — 邵德（al-Saud）家族，承受了要求他们学习邻国榜样的巨大压力，但是内部的反对力量依然很强。	Although the Saudi ruling family, the al-Saud, is under enormous pressure to follow the example of its neighbors, internal resistance to doing so remains very strong.
因为多国部队通常以地区联系或强大的双边关系为基础，他们为军事资源打上“欧洲”的印记，同时又可以确保战场效率。	As multinational forces that are built either on regional affiliations or strong bilateral relations, they bestow a “European” label on military resources while guaranteeing efficiency in the field.
那些出生比率早就下降的地区，如Kerala 和Tamil Nadu这两个邦，学龄人口已经开始减少，但比哈尔邦(Bihar)的学龄人口却还在上升，至少要到2025年这种上升趋势才有可能停止。	Similarly, states where birth rates fell earlier, such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, are already enjoying shrinking school-age populations, whereas school-age numbers in Bihar will still be rising until around 2025.
在“过渡期间陷于停顿”是第三种可能的状况，倘若这种状况发生，利比亚将会陷入既非完全民主亦非独裁统治的“半自由”的“灰色地带 ” 。	Getting “stuck in transition” is a third possible scenario, with Libya remaining in a “gray zone” – neither a fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship, but “semi-free.”
还有一名叫古尔纳兹（Gulnaz）的年轻妇女在遭到亲戚强奸之后竟以通奸罪名入狱（虽然她最近得到总统特赦，但仍可能被迫要和强奸者结婚 ） 。	There was also Gulnaz, a young woman who was jailed for adultery after being raped by a relative (she was recently released after a presidential pardon, but may be forced to marry her attacker).
我们甚至根本无法肯定，这项事业要求这个财力已经透支的国家所要做出的牺牲，再加上世界大国的抵制，奥巴马能在一届总统任期内完成上述目标。	Nor is it at all certain that the sacrifices required of a country already stretched beyond the limits of its financial capabilities, together with the resistance of world powers, will allow this to be accomplished even in a single presidential term.
尽管53%的美国穆斯林认为从2001年恐怖袭击以来日子难过了一点，但是大多数认为这是政府的过错，而不是他们邻居的过错。	Although 53% of US Muslims think that life is more difficult since the terrorist attacks of 2001, most think that this is the fault of the government, not their neighbors.
但这些激励措施为制药企业带来的收益远远超过了实际研发成本；于是成为让公共资金流入私人腰包的工具 — — 而恰恰是这些人最初造成了问题。	But the benefits of such incentives for pharmaceutical companies would far exceed the cost of the actual R&D pursued; they would be instruments to funnel public funds into private hands – the very hands that caused the problem.
无论如何，显然在经历了几十年的广泛连续后 — — 自尼克松总统及其国家安全顾问亨利·基辛格在1972年出人意料地访问中国以来 — — 美国对华政策开始松动。	In any case, it seems clear that after decades of broad continuity – since President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, made their surprise trip to China in 1972 – America’s policy toward China is open to question.
由于所有发达国家在财政上捉襟见肘，而新兴市场国家的财力则因商品价格下跌而被削弱，现在很难找到愿意出资支付全球公共物品的国家。	With all of the advanced countries confronting serious fiscal constraints, and emerging markets weakened by lower commodity prices, paying for global public goods has become all the more unappealing.
双方都必须致力于通过各种谈判机制增加互相理解与信任，鼓励“第二轨道外交 ” （ 规模较小的非国家行为人之间的互动 ） 。	Both sides must work to increase mutual understanding and trust through various negotiation mechanisms and to encourage “track II diplomacy” (interactions among smaller non-state actors).

对英国最常见的两种大麻，hash和sinsemilla （ “ 臭鼬 ” ） 的比较发现，使用臭鼬大麻的精神病风险显著较高，而hash大麻则否。	A comparison of the two most common types of cannabis in the United Kingdom, hash and sinsemilla (“skunk”), found that using skunk implied a significantly greater risk of psychosis, while hash did not.
而目前我们的肉食生产产业模式正在输出到南方国家 — — 特别是印度和中国 — — 这些国家的新兴中产阶级肉食消费日益增加。	And now our industrial model for meat production is being exported to the global south – especially India and China – where meat consumption is rising among these countries’ emerging middle classes.
全球化的所有替代方案要么不现实，要么令人害怕，要么两者兼具，那么，我们怎样才能升华、克服或至少疏导我们的恐惧？	Given that all alternatives to globalization are unrealistic, frightening, or both, how can we sublimate, transcend, or at least channel our fears?
穆沙拉夫和他的政治同盟们不能被视为贝•布托遇刺事件的受益者；他们也决不能企图对此事视而不见，掩而不宣，反对者们必须被纳入决策过程。	Musharraf and his political allies cannot be seen as benefiting from Bhutto’s assassination; nor can they afford the perception of a cover-up. His opponents must be incorporated into the decision-making process.
中国官员将2008—2009年的措施视为一次性措施，也比美国政府早得多地面临了在深度危机时采取的政策的副作用。	Chinese officials viewed their actions in 2008-2009 as one-off measures, and they have been much quicker than their US counterparts to face up to the perils of policies initiated in the depths of the crisis.
自此以后，证据表明，不仅伊拉克没有大规模杀伤性武器，而且，美国和英国政府提供了欺骗性的、扭曲的以及误导的信息。	Since then, evidence has mounted not only that there were no weapons of mass destruction, but that the American and British governments provided deceptive, distorted, and misleading information.
在农民市场中，有大量土豆没卖出去的卖家开始降价，直到价格达到所有土豆都被买走的程度（可能非常低，但仍为正 ） 。	In a farmers’ market, sellers with many unsold potatoes start dropping the price until a level is reached (possibly very low, but still positive) at which all of the potatoes are bought.

这才是我们正确评估中国政治发展与国家治理的标准，而不应该仅以从传统西式国家治理体系导出的期望为标准。	That – not the Western expectation of what a governance system should look like – is the standard by which we should be assessing political developments in China.
但在同一篇讲话中，特朗普也背叛了他授予以色列的更高的地位 ： “ 以色列是一个主权国家，他和其他任何主权国家一样，有权选择自己的首都 。 ”	But, in that same speech, Trump betrayed the superiority he ascribes to Israel: “Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital.”
更重要的是，FON任务和将中国排斥在RIMPAC演习之外都没有改变中国建岛和军事化所导致的地区态势，更不用说中国对邻国的欺凌了。	More important, neither FON operations nor China’s exclusion from the RIMPAC exercise addresses the shifts in regional dynamics brought about by China’s island-building and militarization, not to mention its bullying of its neighbors.
因此，特朗普的议程与欧洲众多民粹主义政党十分相似：实际是反移民强硬态度、经济爱国主义和对本土出生的公民社会福利的组合。	Trump’s agenda thus resembles that of many European populist parties: a mix of anti-immigrant toughness, economic patriotism, and social benefits for native-born citizens.
女性组织参与上述类型的决策会使城市对女性来讲变得更加安全，而这反过来又能促进她们社会、经济、文化和政治机会的改善。	When women’s organizations are involved in these types of decisions, cities become safer for women, which in turn improves their access to social, economic, cultural, and political opportunities.
在过去的一年中，乌克兰官员多次做出承诺，但没有进行任何抓捕行动，没有辨别任何嫌犯，也没有拿出令人信服的作案动机。	Over the last year, Ukrainian officials have made many pledges, but have made no arrests, identified no suspects, and presented no convincing motive for the killing.

比如，美国联邦支出占GDP的比重在20世纪80年代中期至90年代末之间下降了5个百分点，在最近几十年的加拿大，支出-GDP比下降得更多 — — 都是在经济强劲增长期间发生的。	For example, federal spending relative to GDP fell by five percentage points from the mid-1980’s to the late 1990’s in the US, and by an even larger margin in recent decades in Canada – that is, through periods of strong economic growth.
2010年以来，GDP年增长率平均约为2.1 % ， 这比过去60年以来经济萧条的平均复苏增长率的一半还要低。	Since 2010, annual GDP growth has averaged about 2.1%, less than half the average of recoveries from previous US recessions over the last 60 years.
中国上一次经历长期通缩是1998—2002年，物价持续下降的原因是1993年开始的货币和财政紧缩，而缺少倒闭企业退出机制则令情况雪上加霜。	In China’s last protracted bout of deflation, from 1998 to 2002, persistent declines in prices were the result of monetary and fiscal tightening that began in 1993, compounded by the lack of exit mechanisms for failed enterprises.
如果真的成功的话，这将是在近期表现基础上的重大改善：自2000年以来，美国年均经济增长不到2 % 。	If they do, it would represent a significant improvement over recent performance: the US economy has averaged less than 2% annual growth since 2000.
人们原先认为计算能力的提高将改进基因治疗的针对性，因为它使我们能根据个体之间的差异安排从基因治疗到处方用药的所有过程。	The original idea was that greater computing capacity would enable particularized therapies, because we could now turn our attention to individual differences in everything from gene therapy to the delivery of pharmaceuticals.
布拉格 — — 自从亚努科维奇赢得2010年总统大选后，乌克兰民主框架经历了一次具有警示意义的巨大动荡。	PRAGUE – Since the election of President Viktor Yanukovych in 2010, Ukraine has experienced a significant and alarming deterioration in its democratic framework.

"因此，13年前该国以""乌克兰人民""的名义宣布独立，而每一个出生在乌克兰领土上的人，无论其民族状况，都被赋予了公民权利。"	"Thus, the country's declaration of independence 13 years ago was made in the name of ""The people of Ukraine,"" and citizenship was offered to everyone who was born on the territory of Ukraine, regardless of nationality."
但对话应该聚焦于采取直接措施遏制和阻挠朝鲜固有的侵略性核计划 — — 而不是提供更多的让步，让步只能让流氓政权得寸进尺。	But the discussion should focus on direct measures to impede and undermine the country’s inherently aggressive nuclear program – not to offer more concessions that will only strengthen a rogue regime’s hand.
首先，稳固的公共财政 — — 更广义地说，运转良好的国家 — — 只有通过痛苦的紧缩才能实现的观点纯属幻觉。	First and foremost, the dogma that solid public finances – and, more broadly, a functioning state – can be achieved only through painful austerity is an illusion.
最近，利比里亚在后冲突时代重建和人权发展方面取得了成功（此前该国经历了14年的内战 ） ， 因此是发展日程高级别小组会议的理想举办地。	Given Liberia’s recent success in post-conflict reconstruction and human development, following a 14-year civil war, it is a fitting setting for the Panel’s deliberations.
他们认为问题不在于粮食短缺本身，而在于化肥数量不足 — — 接着他们就发明了一种方法，生产出无穷无尽的化肥。	They understood that the problem was not a lack of food per se, but a lack of fertilizer – then they figured out how to make endless amounts of fertilizer.
但是，尽管当前贸易谈判中有允许发展中国家较少开放市场以获得更多好处的趋势，但这可能破坏提高效率、提振增长的初衷。	But, while the tendency in current trade negotiations to allow developing countries to open their markets less than others helps to achieve more balance, it may undermine the original goals of enhancing efficiency and boosting growth.
当 G7 部长们在本周和接下来的会议上会面时，他们将讨论的一个主题是“投资一个可以服务于每个人的增长 ” 。	When G7 ministers meet this week and next, one theme they will discuss is “investing in growth that works for everyone.”
但在国家内部，争夺稀缺水资源正在成为动荡和冲突比较常见的来源，特别是当气候变化加剧了极端天气事件的频率和严重程度。	But, within countries, competition for scarce water is becoming a more common source of instability and conflict, especially as climate change increases the severity and frequency of extreme weather events.
在1994年9月，印尼塞尔蓬(Serpong)研究核反应堆附近一间储藏室发生甲烷气体泄漏，随后一名工人点燃香烟引发爆炸并波及到反应堆。	In September 1994, an explosion at Indonesia’s Serpong research reactor was triggered by the ignition of methane gas that had seeped from a storage room and exploded when a worker lit a cigarette.

鉴于人民党政府颇为壮观地未能履行其任何一项承诺，在2014年曾吸引大批选民的经济承诺这次恐怕会缺乏可信度。	The economic appeal to voters that worked so well in 2014 will lack credibility this time around, given the government’s spectacular failure to fulfill any of its promises.
与此同时，哥伦比亚的主要增长障碍 — — 很可能是石油价格下跌背景下的出口乏力 — — 没有得到解决。	In the meantime, Colombia’s main obstacle to growth, which arguably is the lack of export dynamism, given the fall in oil prices, has not been addressed.
一份2013年的研究测算 ， “ 气候向升温或极端降雨变化一个标准差 ， ” 人际间暴力增加将4 % ， 群体间冲突将增加了14 % 。	A 2013 study estimates that interpersonal violence rises by 4%, and intergroup conflicts by 14%, “for each one standard deviation change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall.”
中国8%的经济增长率向各省官员和工业管理人员传递的信号是，中国政府新兴的绿色GDP承诺 — — 为此，地方政府不仅要显示经济有增长，还要显示是清洁节能的增长 — — 已经被抛弃了。	What the figure of 8% signals to provincial officials and industrial managers is that the emerging promise of green GDP – wherein a local government had to show not only growth, but also clean and energy-efficient growth – has been abandoned.
We have given the Kyoto approach, based on emission rights, more than a fair chance.	We have given the Kyoto approach, based on emission rights, more than a fair chance.

拉古娜海滩—在最近的英国之行中，我十分震惊地发现，关于英国是否应该留在欧盟的问题绝对主宰着媒体、董事会讨论和晚餐谈话。	LAGUNA BEACH – During a recent visit to the United Kingdom, I was struck by the extent to which the question of whether the country should remain in the European Union is dominating the media, boardroom discussions, and dinner conversations.
但随着国际大气候的改变，考虑到美元独大可能出现的系统性风险，美国也会渐渐会接受一个一揽子的货币方案，以减轻美元自身的压力。	But the changed international climate, and the possibility of a bout of severe dollar weakness, could convince the US to go along with a conversion scheme that would alleviate excessive pressure on the dollar.
马德里—本月，美国国家情报委员会公布了一份不容乐观的报告 ： 《 全球趋势2030：不一样的世界 》 （ Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds ） 。	MADRID – This month, the United States National Intelligence Council released a sobering report entitled Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds.
这种做法也将意味着欧盟对英国商品征收进口关税 — — 包括10％的汽车出口关税 — — 以及非关税壁垒。	This approach would also entail import tariffs on British goods – including a 10% duty on its car exports to the EU – as well as non-tariff barriers.
随着个人和社会的富裕，他们彼此之间的联系也日益紧密 — — 既包括通过通信技术实现的虚拟联系，也包括通过人口增长、城市化和旅行实现的实体联系。	As individuals and societies become richer, they come into closer contact with one another – virtually, through communication technologies, and physically, through population growth, urbanization, and travel.
今日的主要问题在于，2007年之后累积起来的资本市场失灵（以及由此而来的政府负债问题 ） ， 是否已经严重到大萧条的水平。	The major question today should be whether the failure of capital markets (and the implications for government debt) after 2007 has been as severe as during the Great Depression.

新结构经济学将经济发展视为技术、产业以及软硬基础设施的持续的结构变化过程 — — 所有这些因素都能提高劳动生产率，进而提高人均收入。	NSE treats modern economic development as a process of continuous structural change in technologies, industries, and hard and soft infrastructure – all of which increases labor productivity, and thus per capita income.
回到宏观层面，中国需要在各级政府间重新分配责任和资源，以利用它们在提供服务和筹集收入方面的比较优势。	Back at the macro level, China needs to reallocate responsibilities and resources among the various levels of government, in order to capitalize on their comparative advantage in providing services and raising revenue.
不管从理论上还是操作上，运转正常的现代央行资产负债表上可以（以及应该）出现多少国债是存在界限的。 尽管没人可以这一界限在哪里。	And, while no one can be certain about where the limits lie, there are both theoretical and operational bounds to how many government bonds can (and should) be placed on the balance sheet of a modern, well-functioning central bank.
美国前总统吉米·卡特已经对美国最近的选举是否符合美国应当遵守的标准提出质疑。 由他创立的亚特兰大中心监督全球的选举。	Former President Jimmy Carter, whose Atlanta center monitors elections around the globe, has raised questions about whether America’s recent election lives up to the standards the United States should uphold.
尽管执政的少数族裔政权普遍对合计占总人口29%的基督徒、库尔德人和德鲁兹人持容忍态度，却长期压迫逊尼派多数族裔。	While the ruling minority has been generally tolerant of Christians, Kurds, Druze, and Turks, who together comprise 29% of the population, the regime has long oppressed the Sunni majority.
而18名委员中只有一位来自哈马斯控制的加沙地带（须知法塔赫管辖的巴勒斯坦民众有一半都生活于此）的事实，也令本次选举的合法性大打折扣。	The fact that only one out of 18 members will be from the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, which contains about half of all the Palestinians that Fatah governs, also skews the results.
大选之后，许多人希望卡尔扎伊能建立一个值得信任政府，确保阿富汗的未来和后期维和部队介入及国际援助的顺利展开。	After the election, many hoped that Karzai would recognize the need to build a more accountable government to help secure both Afghanistan's future and the future of international military and financial support.
这一点非常重要，因为新陈代谢能力较低者与能力较高者相比，其清除某些药物的速度较慢，生理系统中药物残存量较大。	That is important because low metabolizers clear certain drugs slowly and have more medication in their systems for longer periods of time than high metabolizers.

正如马克龙自身必定认识到的那样，欧盟的长期存续要求“欧洲计划”不仅要赢得领导层的支持，更要具备对欧洲民众的吸引力。	As Macron himself surely understands, the EU’s long-term viability requires that the “European project” appeal to its citizens more than its leadership.
桑德斯所提出的全面方案 — — 单一出资者的医疗体系和免费公立大学 — — 不论如何不切实际，总归大受欢迎，特别是年轻人压倒性地支持他而不是克林顿。	The sweeping programs Sanders is pushing – a single-payer health-care system and free tuition at public colleges – however impracticable, are popular, especially among younger people, who overwhelmingly favor him over Clinton.

中国当局很清楚自己的国家通过与全球经济的深度整合获益良多，也没打算拿自身国内统治合法性基础 — — 经济增长 — — 去冒险。	The Chinese authorities are well aware of how much their country has benefited from becoming deeply integrated into the global economy. And they are not prepared to risk the basis of their domestic legitimacy: economic growth.
施密特鼓吹普及门罗主义（Monroe doctrine）的全球秩序：大国划定不可侵犯的地缘政治势力范围，即“大空间 ” （ Grossraum ） ， 由此实现相互尊重。	Schmitt advocates a global order that universalizes the Monroe doctrine: great nations stake out inviolable zones of geographic influence, or Grossraum, from which they afford each other mutual respect.
将仲裁案提交海牙的菲律宾也在加强军力，从韩国采购战斗机并向海军新投资，不仅有美国支持，也有日本支持。	The Philippines, which brought the case against China in The Hague, is beefing up its military as well, with the procurement of fighter jets from South Korea and new investments in its navy, supported not only by the US, but also by Japan.
在相互矛盾的资格要求，重复申请以及复杂的多机构审批程序下，每4个有资格获得联邦住房援助的家庭中就有3个无法领取。	Three out of four households that qualify for federal housing assistance are not receiving it, owing to conflicting eligibility requirements, duplicative applications, and complex multi-agency approval processes.
因此，该方式的主要支持者（卡尔德隆、前哥伦比亚总统乌里韦、前任和现任巴西总统以及美国保守派和安全机构）正在失去公众支持。	Consequently, the main advocates of this approach (Calderón, former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, the current and former presidents of Brazil, and America’s conservatives and security establishment) are losing public support.
即便是在经济快速发展的国家，由人口统计上的巨大变化所驱动的一系列因素，已经悄然将知识、社会责任和生活机会的不平等从一代人转移到下一代人。	Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next.
虽然阿富汗塔利班政权早已在2001年末被推翻，但却在短短几年之内就成功恢复元气，卷土重来，究其原因，都是因为阿富汗政府及其国际支持者没能成功重建，并把这个国家稳定下来。	The Afghan Taliban, removed from power and routed from the country by the end of 2001, needed only a few years to revive itself, owing to the failure of the Afghan government and its international backers to rebuild and stabilize the country.
互联网的创造者 — — 他们属于一个封闭的小圈子 — — 对安全并非主要顾虑的开放系统感到十分满意。	The Internet’s creators, part of a small, enclosed community, were very comfortable with an open system in which security was not a primary concern.
虽然巴黎谈判人士不再要求零净排放，但这应当成为各国计划的目标，得到20国集团的批准，并最终体现在联合国协议当中。	While the net-zero objective was dropped by the negotiators in Paris, it should be endorsed by individual countries in their plans, reinforced by the G-20, and eventually enshrined in the UN agreement.
但令人担忧的是 ， “ 哥本哈根会议第二轮”不但要在这种复杂的情势下进行探索，而且还必须在5年之内展开运作。	Worryingly, “Copenhagen 2” will not only have to navigate this complicated terrain, but it must do so in less than five years.
而且事实上，据美国情报部门的估测显示 ，截至去年9月，从土耳其流向叙利亚加入伊斯兰国等组织的国外招募者数量已经从高峰时期的每月2，000人减少到区区50人左右。	And, indeed, US intelligence estimates indicate that, by last September, the flow of foreign recruits crossing from Turkey into Syria to join groups like ISIS had dropped from a high of 2,000 per month to as few as 50.
推倒柏林墙20周年的纪念活动将于11月举行，而距离欧盟上一轮“宇宙大爆炸”式的大规模扩张也已整整5年。	The 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall will be commemorated in November, and it has been five years since the European Union’s “Big Bang” enlargement.
失业率一直居高不下，2009年的7870亿美元刺激计划也没能让失业率有所改善；而房价尽管缓慢地开始复苏，但对2008年高峰水平仍然望尘莫及。	Unemployment remains persistently high, despite the $787 billion stimulus package in 2009, and house prices, though recovering slowly, remain far below their pre-2008 peak.
极低的通胀锦上添花 — — 让盯住通胀目标的美联储有充足的空间尝试非常规政策而不会给通胀敏感的债券市场带来负面利率后果。	Exceptionally low inflation was the icing on the cake – providing the inflation-targeting Fed with plenty of leeway to experiment with unconventional policies while avoiding adverse interest-rate consequences in the inflation-sensitive bond market.
或者，与自然光合作用系统一样，催化剂能直接减少二氧化碳 — — 在这个例子中将二氧化碳转换为乙醇和甲烷。	Alternatively, catalysts, as in natural photosynthetic systems, could directly reduce carbon dioxide, in this case to methanol or methane.
在介绍一位印度数学家进入哈佛大学时，Ludwig Wittgenstein这样写道 ： “ 科学方面的天才通常在其一生中能有一个伟大的观点；他有两个 。 ”	When recommending an Indian mathematician to a Harvard colleague, Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote that: “scientific geniuses generally have one great idea in their life; he has had two.”
当美国人在为入侵阿富汗作准备时，塔利班也被妖魔化为不许妇女使用化妆品或染发。 而当塔利班被推翻时，西方的作家常常会注意到妇女们已经摘去了头巾。	When Americans were being prepared for the invasion of Afghanistan, the Taliban were demonized for denying cosmetics and hair color to women; when the Taliban were overthrown, Western writers often noted that women had taken off their scarves.
这非常重要，因为京都议定书已经成为所制定出来的最为昂贵的全球公共政策，而2009年底在哥本哈根举行的跟进措施将会打破所有的记录。	This matters immensely, because the Kyoto Protocol is already among the most expensive global public policies ever enacted, and the follow-up in Copenhagen in late 2009 promises to break all records.
捷克共和国、匈牙利和斯洛伐克或许应该更自然地与奥地利和斯洛文尼亚展开更紧密的地区性合作。 这种合作的轮廓已经在一些现有的地区性分组中显现出来。	It may be more natural for the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia to strive for closer regional cooperation with Austria and Slovenia, the contours of which can already be seen in some existing regional groupings.
替代方案是削减名义工资 （ “ 内部”贬值 ） ， 而这很难办到（尽管拉脱维亚和爱尔兰做到了 ） 。	The alternative would be to cut nominal wages (“internal” devaluation), which is hard to do (though it has been achieved in Latvia and Ireland).
对信贷增长的宏观审慎管控是有用的，但有时无法阻止信贷泡沫产生，因为低利率会持续创造过剩的流动性环境。	Macroprudential controls on credit growth are useful, but sometimes ineffective in stopping asset bubbles when low interest rates continue to underpin generous liquidity conditions.
考虑到如此大的反对，宪法第9条的实际修改而不只是重新解释看起来并不可行，特别是在明确以和平主义为旗帜的公明党仍身处执政联盟中的情况下。	Given such opposition, an actual revision of Article 9, rather than just a reinterpretation, does not seem feasible, especially while the avowedly pacifist Komeito party remains part of the ruling coalition.
“只要我们购买中国制造的产品 ， ” 他在去年讨论美国及其盟友时写道 ， “ 作为消费者的我们就在资助中国构建用于伤害我们和我们的国家的军事力量 。 ”	“Whenever we buy products made in China,” he wrote last year of the US and its allies, “we as consumers are helping to finance a Chinese military buildup that may well mean to do us and our countries harm.”
发自荷兰蒂尔堡 — — 两年前，各国央行的领导人都受到了英雄般的待遇，因为他们成功阻止了经济危机演变成另一场大萧条。	TILBURG, THE NETHERLANDS – Two years ago, the leaders of the world’s central banks were considered heroes for their efforts in preventing financial crisis from turning into Great Depression II.
当然，历史不是宿命，但我们可以肯定地说，在俄罗斯总统普京周围至少有一些人，甚至普京本人，一直在思考奥加尔科夫的失败对苏联精英的影响。	Of course, history is not destiny, but one can be sure that at least some in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s entourage, if not Putin himself, have been thinking about Ogarkov’s failure and its impact on the Soviet elite.
美国总统奥巴马对亚洲的战略“枢纽”主要依赖于颁布包含12个国家的跨太平洋伙伴关系协定（英文缩写为TPP ） ， 但特朗普则声称在他上任第一天就会废除此协议。	US President Barack Obama’s strategic “pivot” to Asia depended primarily on enacting the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump has promised to scrap on his first day in office.
澳大利亚卧龙岗大学（University of Wollongong）的研究团队以保护臭氧层的蒙特利尔议定书为灵感，建议对新塑料产品采取限额和禁止措施。	A research team from the University of Wollongong in Australia, taking inspiration from the Montreal Protocol, the treaty that safeguards the ozone layer, has suggested caps and bans on new plastic production.
你们不仅不能帮助我们和以色列人达成能为各方（两国政府和两国人民）所接受的解决方案，反而竭尽全力来加剧这场危机。	Instead of helping us and the Israelis reach a solution acceptable to all – two states for two peoples – you do everything to exacerbate the conflict.
他将1963年8月在华盛顿的游行 — — 他正是在那里发表了充满力量且令人难忘的“我有一个梦想”演讲，而笔者也参与了游行 — — 称之为一场争取工作和自由的游行。	King called his August 1963 march on Washington, which I joined and at which he delivered his ringing, unforgettable “I Have a Dream” speech, a march for jobs and freedom.
要理解这样说的原因，很重要的是要知道，在2007年美国总统布什下令急速增派二万名美国士兵进驻伊拉克以及戴维·彼得雷乌斯将军把美军的战略调整为更具进攻性时，伊拉克国内到底还发生了其它什么事情。	To understand why, it is important to know what else was going on inside Iraq in 2007, when President George W. Bush ordered the “surge” of 20,000 additional troops and General David H. Petraeus shifted US forces to a more aggressive strategy.
在委内瑞拉的例子中，这些政策包括征用、价格和汇率管制、在繁荣期过度借贷、反商业监管、边境封闭，等等。	In Venezuela’s case, these policies included expropriations, price and exchange controls, over-borrowing in good times, anti-business regulations, border closures, and more.
在这一情形中，欧盟再一次怀疑英国用北爱尔兰当作特洛伊木马，获得不公平的优势，而英国退欧派则指责梅屈服于布鲁塞尔的勒索犯。	On this occasion, the EU once again suspected the UK of using Northern Ireland as a Trojan horse to gain an unfair advantage, and the Brexiteers accused May of capitulating to the extortionist gangsters in Brussels.
肯尼迪的许多顾问和美国军方领导人敦促他采取空袭和入侵，现在我们知道，这有可能导致苏联指挥官动用战术核武器。	Many of Kennedy’s advisers, as well as US military leaders, urged an air strike and invasion, which we now know might have led Soviet field commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons.
债权人至少在六百年前就已经知道哦这一点。 当时，西班牙国王菲利普二世成为世界上首位已知的系列主权违约者。	Creditors have known this since at least the sixteenth century, when Spain’s King Philip II became the world’s first known serial sovereign defaulter.
本周，阿布扎比将召开抵达最后一英里（Reaching the Last Mile）论坛，200多位疾病防治方面的领导者将齐聚一堂。 我们希望借此可以进一步推动全球合作。	We hope to encourage further global collaboration this week, as Abu Dhabi convenes more than 200 leaders in disease eradication at a forum called Reaching the Last Mile.
我们首先从“无协议”分手的威胁开始考虑，这意味着英国将在根本未能就新关系达成任何协议的情况下被踢出欧盟。	Start with the threat of a “no deal” rupture, whereby Britain would crash out of the EU with no agreement at all on a new relationship.
更高的经济开放度加上固定的名义汇率，使中国摆脱了通胀，并且在1994年以后的实际GDP增长也变得更加稳定。	Greater economic openness, coupled with the fixed nominal exchange rate, ended China’s inflationary roller-coaster ride, and, after 1994, real GDP growth also became more stable.
相反，特朗普鼓吹为富人减税，并似乎准备采取某种形式的国家资本主义 — — 乃至裙带资本主义 — — 通过保护主义政策和为支持美国制造的公司提供特殊激励实现。	By contrast, Trump advocates lower taxes for the wealthy, and seems willing to embrace some form of state capitalism – if not crony capitalism – via protectionist policies and special incentives for companies to manufacture in the US.
受益于中国的高储蓄率，2015年底中国银行系统贷款与存款之比为74 % ， 存在央行的法定准备金率高达17.4 % 。	Thanks to China’s high saving rate, the country’s banking system had a loan-to-deposit ratio of 74% at the end of 2015, with 17.5% in required reserves held at the central bank.
习近平强调党的控制 — — 通过打压国有企业、政府反对派和媒体和学界的批评 — — 以此寻求推动改革能力最大化和保守派挑战风险最小化。	By emphasizing Party control – through a crackdown on SOEs, government opponents, and critics in the media and academia – Xi seeks to maximize his ability to impose economic reforms while minimizing the risk of a challenge from conservative forces.
在这方面，最显著的例子莫过于TPP，该条约几乎肯定将构成所有签约国保护 — — 甚至形成 — — 中产阶级的最大单一障碍。	There is no clearer example of this than the TPP, which almost certainly constitutes the single biggest threat to the preservation – or creation – of any signatory country’s middle class.
但对施罗德受雇于该公司的正当性的严肃调查却从来没有启动过，这可能是受制于德俄两国经济关系的范围和严重性。	But no serious investigation of the propriety of Schröder’s dealings was ever launched, perhaps because of the scale and importance of German-Russian economic ties.
如果你问大部分加泰罗尼亚人，除了摆脱西班牙独立还能带来什么，你不会听到多少答案：对历史错误的仇恨压倒了任何对未来的认真算计。	Ask most Catalans what independence will bring, aside from freedom from Spain, and you won’t get much of an answer: resentment at past wrongs overshadows any serious calculations about the future.
国际社会陷入了深深的分裂，从叙利亚、伊拉克和乌克兰危机到气候变化和全球贸易的一系列全球挑战的进展遭遇阻碍。	The international community is deeply divided, blocking progress on a host of global challenges, ranging from the crises in Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine to climate change and international trade.
如果有什么区别的话，最新的进展证明了印度长期以来与缅甸建立友好关系的政策是正确的，因为缅甸是一个在贸易、运输、能源及国防上对印度来说都具有战略及经济重要性的国家。	If anything, the latest developments vindicate India’s long-held policy of engaging with Myanmar, a country of major strategic and economic importance to it in terms of trade, transport, energy, and security.
最近加入欧元区的成员国爱沙尼亚也面临相同的状况，该国严格的工资限制保证其短期内在这个单一市场上拥有一定的竞争力。	The same is true for the most recent eurozone member, Estonia, whose rigorous wage restraint ensured competitiveness in the single market in a short period of time.
第五步是让女性充分、平等地融入联合国议程的所有部分，而不只满足于融入与“妇女”问题有关的分散的领域当中。	A fifth step should be to integrate women fully and equally into all parts of the UN agenda, not just in discrete areas pertaining to “women’s” issues.
于是，珍惜格鲁吉亚与俄国历史渊源的人士被客气地称做“复古主义者 ” ， 更有甚者，他们被指责为“格鲁吉亚独立的敌人 ” ， 就好像我们一上台，格鲁吉亚就会沦为俄国的殖民地。	Thus, those of us who value Georgia’s historical ties with Russia are called, at best, “archaists,” and at worst “enemies of Georgian independence,” as if Georgia would become a Russian colony if we ever came to power.
他的两本近著分别起名为《死于中国 》 （ Death by China，2011年）和《卧虎：中国军国主义对世界意味着什么 》 （ Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World，2015年 ） ， 里面充斥着地摊文学水平的偏见。	The titles of his two most recent books – Death by China (2011) and Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World (2015) – speak volumes about his tabloid-level biases.
当这两个泡沫破裂时 — — 先是房地产泡沫，再是信用泡沫 — — 依赖资产的美国消费者就陷入了美国版日本病。 日本病理论首先由野村证券经济学家辜朝明提出。	When both bubbles burst – first housing, and then credit – asset-dependent US consumers were exposed to the American strain of the Japanese disease first diagnosed by Nomura economist Richard Koo.
MGI地区企业调查表明，外国投资和所有权限制、矛盾的标准和监管以及低效的通关流程是仍然存在的重大贸易壁垒。	An MGI survey of regional businesses identified restrictions on foreign investment and ownership, inconsistent standards and regulations, and inefficient customs procedures as the biggest remaining barriers to trade.
另一个则是马哈茂德·达兰，此人同样是一个前囚犯和前安全部队官员，但此人对加沙地区落入哈马斯之手负有责任，许多巴勒斯坦人也对他半信半疑，所以其政治前途也相对比较暗淡。	Another is Mahmoud Dahlan, also an ex-prisoner and former security official, although the loss of Gaza to Hamas, for which many Palestinians hold him partly responsible, has dimmed his leadership prospects.
此类情况同样发生在世界的其他地方，例如俄罗斯，乌克兰，匈牙利，巴基斯坦，土耳其，马来西亚，墨西哥，尼日利亚等国家。 国内不同的政策走向往往导致推出经济政策的不连贯性。	In Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Pakistan, Turkey, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, and other states, battles among domestic political factions will yield often-incoherent responses to pressing economic problems.
这种观点反映在政府对北方邦袭击事件的反应上，一名暴徒毒打一位穆斯林和并差点把他儿子打死，仅仅是因为他们怀疑他杀死了一头牛。	This view was reflected in the government’s response to an attack in Uttar Pradesh, where a mob lynched a Muslim and beat his son nearly to death, simply because they suspected that he had killed a cow.
伦敦—新闻自由和独立是全世界民主的主要成分，据2015年世界新闻自由指数，它正在以令人警觉的速度下滑。	LONDON – Press freedom and independence, a staple ingredient of democracy worldwide, is declining at an alarming pace, according to the 2015 World Press Freedom Index.
本世纪以来，有一百多万人因为黑格比和其他大灾难而丧生 — — 如2010年的海地地震，造成的总经济损失接近2万亿美元。	Since the beginning of the century, more than a million people have died in storms like Hagupit and other major disasters, such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake, with economic damage totaling nearly $2 trillion.
也许，IMF的2006年报告封存起来，保存在防火墙后或黑暗网络深处，放在没有索引的灾难预测博物馆中更好。	Perhaps it would be better if the IMF’s 2006 report could be put beyond reach, behind a firewall or somewhere on the dark web, in an unindexed museum of forecasting disasters.
她认为，我们需要关闭地球上75%的燃煤发电厂，包括南非所有的燃煤发电厂，因为它们排出过多的二氧化碳。	She argues that we need to close 75% of the planet’s coal-fired power plants, including all of South Africa’s, because they emit too much CO2.
lamp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 根据一家华盛顿的咨询公司的评估，美国的环保行业在2005年产生了超过3400亿美元的营业收入以及大约500亿美元的税收。	·A Washington-based consulting firm estimates that the U.S. environmental industry generated more than $340 billion in sales and almost $50 billion in tax revenues in 2005.
1993年以前，中国还无需进口石油，但是现在每年消耗越来越多的进口石油，电力消耗预计到2025年将翻一番，平均每个星期都有一个新的煤炭发电厂建成投产才能满足这种需求。	Petroleum independent until 1993, China now consumes more and more imported petroleum every year, and power consumption is predicted to double by 2025, requiring an average of one new coal-fired plant to come on line each week.
巴勒斯坦领导人希望特朗普 — — 一位沉溺于他的遗产中的商人 — — 最终能够拿出必要的决心，使出美国总统的“洪荒之力”确保“最终协议 ” 。	Palestinian leaders hope that Trump, a businessman obsessed with his legacy, will finally display the needed resolve, using the full clout of the US presidency to secure the “ultimate deal.”
但说到底这毕竟是电视剧，最后宋思明在听闻他怀孕的情人出事后立刻驱车赶往医院 — — 后面还有纪检部门的车子紧追不舍 — — 最终在车祸中身亡。	Then, because this is a soap opera, Song suddenly dies in a car crash, just as he is rushing to the hospital – while being chased by corruption investigators! – to check on his sweetheart and their unborn baby boy.
犹太复国主义兼具民主和乌托邦的思想使犹太人使他们重新获得了对耶路撒冷的继承权，并且使他们拥有通向未来的钥匙。	Zionism’s unique combination of democracy and utopianism enabled the Jews to recover their birthright and gave them a key to the future.
如果政府的确希望建设更有力、更兼容并蓄的欧洲安全秩序，缓解并最终消除核武器的后果和威胁，这只是部分必须要做的事。	This is only a partial list of what must be done if governments are serious about building a stronger, inclusive European security order, one where the roles and risks of nuclear weapons are reduced, and ultimately eliminated.
新的SDG制定了一个崇高的目标（goal ） ： 历史上第一次，世界领导人承诺要减少因癌症、心脏病和糖尿病等慢性疾病所引起的过早死亡。	The new SDGs set a lofty goal: for the first time, world leaders have vowed to reduce premature deaths caused by chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
为实现这一目标，政府可以扩大农民群体对资源及野生动物的使用权，以求使他们能以长远的眼光对自然资源进行管理和保护。	To help with this, governments can increase rural communities’ resource- and wildlife-use rights so that they can manage and protect their natural resources sustainably.
事实上，美国的传统观点认为，有关墨西哥非法移民和毒品的政策是新国土安全部部长珍妮·纳波利塔诺（Janet Napolitano ） （ 她自己曾担任边境州的州长）的职权范围。	Indeed, the conventional wisdom in the US is that Mexico policy regarding illegal immigration and drugs will be the province of the new Homeland Security secretary, Janet Napolitano (herself a former border state governor).
特别要指出的是，塔霍的研究显示美国国会议员们会更多地购买支持本党派的企业的股票，而一旦他们抛出这些股票，那些企业就不再向他们提供竞选资金了。	In particular, Tahoun’s research shows that US congressmen systematically invest more in firms that favor their own party, and that when they sell stock, firms stop contributing to their campaigns.
当富者愈富，富人们享受着自从“黄金繁荣的二十年代”以来最大的狂欢，而当家庭的平均收入连续第三个十年停滞不前的时候，要做到这一点是不容易的。	It is not easy to do this when the rich get richer – enjoying their biggest spree since the Roaring Twenties – and average household income remains stagnant for the third decade running.
即便不考虑转移支付在大多数国家已经在财政上不可持续的事实（因为该政策早在经济和人口构成尚处于理想状态时就被实施和扩大了 ） ， 它们是否就能提振经济呢？	Leaving aside the fact that transfer payments are already fiscally unsustainable in most countries (because they were adopted and expanded under better economic and demographic conditions), could they lift the economy?
前纽约市长迈克尔·彭博（Michael Bloomberg）最近观察道，慈善家应该检验创新政策思维，然后依靠政府资金推而广之。	As former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently observed, philanthropists should test innovative policy ideas and then rely on government money to implement them widely.
但是，可能大家没有注意到，华尔街（或者更一般地说，整个金融界）对成功的奖赏正在发生变化，这亦是理所当然，正如金融的定义必须做出改变，如果金融界想赢回崇高的社会地位以及公民和领导人的信任的话。	But, however imperceptibly, the rewards for success on Wall Street, and in finance more generally, are changing, just as the definition of finance must change if is to reclaim its stature in society and the trust of citizens and leaders.
第二种说法涉及思想观念：出于某种原因，布什和他的人认为重要的是要破坏富兰克林·罗斯福“新政”体系取得的成就。	The second is ideology. For some reason Bush and his people think it is important to undermine the successes of the New Deal institutions established under Franklin Roosevelt.
气候行动应该被视为改善世界最贫困人群的办法 — — 他们是最需要协定的人群 — — 而不是成为他们的负担。	Climate action should be viewed as a means to improve the well-being of the world’s poorest people – those who most need an agreement – rather than as a burden.
此外，尽管美国哦人口只占世界人口的不到5 % ， 但其阿片药物消费量占据了四分之三以上 — — 这导致了致瘾率和服药过量的暴增。	And, despite having less than 5% of the world’s population, the US accounts for more than three-quarters of global opioid consumption – leading to a surge in addiction rates and overdoses.
正如在1990年发布的第一份《联合国人类发展报告》所指出的那样 ： “ 人民才是一个国家真正的财富 。 ”	As the first United Nations Human Development Report put it in 1990: “People are the real wealth of a nation.”
“总量管制和排放交易”是为了限制二氧化碳的排放而制定的一项立法，目的是限制碳排放量对环境的长期危害。	While aimed at reducing long-term environmental damage, cap-and-trade policies could produce significant harmful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future.
如果我们想要理解当今中东 — — 而不仅仅是叙利亚 — — 真正在发生什么，就必须考虑逊尼派-什叶派对立、阿拉伯半岛分裂以及过去围绕伊斯兰教统治权的斗争的源头。	If we are to understand what is really happening in the Middle East today – not just in Syria – one must consider the origins of the Sunni-Shia schism, the Arab-Persian divide, and past struggles over the governance of Islam.
由此可推出一个假说，即雇主受困于极低的生产率增长（尤其是过去十年 ） ， 也不敢提高工资 — — 尽管需求已经回归危机前水平。	A corollary hypothesis is that employers, disturbed by the extremely slow growth of productivity, especially in the past ten years, have grown leery of granting pay raises – despite the return of demand to pre-crisis proportions.
作为行政目标的宣传语 ， “ 中华民族的伟大复兴”有点长了，但它最近被改成了较为简单的“中国梦 ” 。	As a catchphrase for his administration’s objective, “the great renaissance of the Chinese nation” is bit long, but it has lately morphed into the simpler “China Dream.”
金砖国家峰会的一个重要成果是宣布成立新开发银行为基础设施和可持续发展工程动员资源，以及建立一个应急储备安排（Contingent Reserve Arrangement）以通过货币互换提供流动性。	The upshot of the BRICS meeting was the announcement of the New Development Bank, which will mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects, and a Contingent Reserve Arrangement to provide liquidity through currency swaps.
从历史看，英国对产业补贴的热衷程度远远比不上其贸易伙伴，因此，如果关于产业支持和反补贴关税的国际规则得到明确，对英国大有裨益。	Because the UK has historically shown far less appetite for industrial subsidies than its trading partners have, it stands to gain from clear international rules on industrial support and anti-subsidy tariffs.
避难制度完全没有做好准备以应对新一代难民。 根据当前框架，新一代移民没有资格避难，因为他们不是为了逃脱具体的压迫型为，而是因为祖国分崩离析而成为难民。	The asylum system is totally unprepared to deal with the new generation of refugees, who are ineligible under the existing framework, because they are fleeing not from specific acts of persecution, but from the disintegration of their states.
多年来，谈判人员一直为限制温室气体排放努力签订一份雄心勃勃并具有约束力的协议。 当时全世界的目光都聚焦到丹麦。	For years, negotiators had been working toward an ambitious, binding agreement to limit greenhouse-gas emissions, and the world’s attention was directed toward Denmark.
在全球化的世界里，就像近年来爆发的SARS、埃博拉和寨卡病毒一样，一个国家的传染病暴发可能迅速演变成对其他地方卫生的严重威胁。	In a globalized world, an outbreak of infectious disease in one country could quickly evolve into a serious threat to health elsewhere, as has happened in recent years with SARS, Ebola, and Zika.
由于在苏黎世、迈阿密、伦敦以及其他地区的银行账户，发展中国家的富裕国民每年在自己的祖国逃避了超过1000亿美元的税款。	Wealthy citizens in the developing world evade more than $100 billion worth of taxes in their home countries each year, thanks to bank accounts in Zurich, Miami, London, and elsewhere.
但是，在我们因为越来越高的食品价格而产生的人道主义危机时，也不应该忽视在最近几十年来使食品安全受到破坏的更长期的问题。	But, as we respond to the current humanitarian emergency due to higher food prices, we must not lose sight of the longer-term problems that have undermined food security in recent decades.
去年四月份，英国反对党保守党领袖大卫·卡梅隆（David Cameron）说明了为什么我们应该为北约的远征任务建立一个真正的行动基金，并且所有的成员都要为这个基金提供资金。	Last April, the leader of the UK’s opposition Conservative Party, David Cameron, explained why we should establish a real operational fund for NATO expeditionary missions, with every member state required to contribute.
科学家一致认为，若要在本世纪中叶实现碳中性（排放量减少到能够被森林、土壤和其他自然系统轻松吸收的程度 ） ， 全球二氧化碳排放量必须在2020年实现由增转减。	Scientists agree that global carbon dioxide emissions must reach a turning point in 2020 if we are to achieve carbon neutrality (with emissions low enough to be safely absorbed by forests, soils, and other natural systems) by mid-century.
说真的，英国财政大臣欧思邦（George Osborne）甚至说 ： “ 在一般商业里，欺骗是一宗罪，为什么在银行业就不该是呢 ？ ”	Indeed, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne went so far as to say, “Fraud is a crime in ordinary business; why shouldn’t it be so in banking?”
或许真正重要的是一位候选人当选总统的所作所为：他执政下的政府权力制衡，所给出的建议，所做的决策，最终则是所追求的政策。	Perhaps what really matters is what happens after a candidate takes office: the quality of the checks and balances within which he or she operates, the advice offered, the decisions taken, and, ultimately, the policies pursued.
其中最糟糕的指责要数对那些犯有针对本国人民的大规模暴行的人立场软弱 — — 比如埃及目前的军事统治者。	And worst of all is to be perceived as being soft on those who, like Egypt’s current military rulers, commit mass-atrocity crimes against their own citizens.
简言之，欧盟发放补助时，人们趋之若骛；但一旦推行不受欢迎的改革，欧盟就成了政治、社会和经济弊政的替罪羔羊。	In short, when the EU brings subsidies, it receives congratulations; but when it pushes for unpopular reforms, it becomes the scapegoat for political, social, and economic failures.
巴黎 — — 2005年，在中国政府的赞助下，伦敦的皇家艺术学院举办了一场著名的展览 — — “天皇”之展，该展览展示的是伟大的中国艺术。	PARIS – In 2005, at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, a prestigious exhibit sponsored by the Chinese Government, “The Three Emperors,” celebrated the greatness of Chinese art.
但到目前为止，欧盟一直不愿对欧尔班政权采取严厉的惩罚行动，因为它不想冒险将匈牙利进一步推向俄罗斯的怀抱。	But, so far, the EU has been reluctant to take serious punitive action against Orbán’s regime, because it does not want to risk pushing Hungary further into Russia’s embrace.
而在美国，总统特朗普的当选预示着“另类事实”和“推特治国”时代的到来，领导这个国家的将是一个反覆而无知的、显然是心智失常的领导人。	And, in the US, the election of President Donald Trump heralded the age of “alternative facts” and “governance by tweet,” overseen by an erratic and ignorant leader who is clearly in over his head.
如果我们不是那么被绥靖纳粹政权的记忆以及随后的种族屠杀所困扰，那么人们就可能不会如此关心人权问题了。	If we were less haunted by memories of appeasing the Nazi regime, and of the ensuing genocide, people might not be as concerned about human rights as they are.
在这场拥挤的权力角力中，只有日本置身事外，在很大程度上选择了冷眼旁观，并着力培养与美国的关系。 美国现在提供反导技术来对付朝鲜的威胁。	In this crowded power play, only Japan is left out, choosing for the most part to remain aloof and cultivate its relations with the US, which is now to supply anti-missile technology to counter the North Korean threat.
但迄今为止，中国运用刺激政策一直相对谨慎，因为他们应当会认识到美国关税仅会对中国出口产生极其微弱的影响。	But China’s stimulus measures have so far been cautious, as they should be considering the negligible impact that US tariffs have had on Chinese exports.
汉斯莫拉维茨和其他计算机科学家在20世纪80年代时指出，对我们来说轻而易举的事情，对最先进的人工智能来说也是难于上青天；反之，人工智能常常能够轻松完成我们认为困难的事情。	Hans Moravec and other computer scientists pointed out in the 1980s that what is simple for us is hard for even the most sophisticated AI; conversely, AI often can do easily what we regard as difficult.

现代技术使得新兴经济体工人加入到全球劳动力市场；在没有重大政策创新的背景下，这可能造成对发达国家的长期拖累。	Modern technology has enabled workers in emerging economies to join a global labor market; in the absence of major policy innovation, this is likely to cause a prolonged drag on rich countries.
很多国会议员和军方高级领导人都呼吁采取更加强硬的应对举措，包括将朝鲜重新列入支持恐怖主义国家名单、使用美国特战部队实施“外科手术式”打击。	Many congressmen and senior military officials are now calling for a tougher response, which could include restoring the Kim regime to a list of state sponsors of terrorism, and using US Special Forces to launch surgical strikes.

甚至在20世纪70年代的停滞时期（增长缓慢、物价上升 ） ， 问题也被认为是社会民主的过度延伸，而不是西方政治经济学存在根本性缺陷。	Even during the stagflation (slow growth and rising prices) in the 1970s, the problem was said to be social-democratic overreach, not any fundamental flaw in the political economy of the West.
联合国千年发展目标的核心内容 — — 扶贫主要是以国内生产总值的增长来衡量的，但是必须包括健康经济依靠的自然资本的可持续管理。	Poverty alleviation, central to the UN Millennium Development Goals, is largely measured in GDP growth, but must include sustainable management of the natural capital on which economic health depends.
沿着这条道路，一大批著名物理学家前赴后继地追寻这个答案 — — 爱因斯坦，沃纳·海森堡和理查德·费曼则是他们的杰出代表。	Along the way, a number of famous physicists tried and failed to get the answer – Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and Richard Feynman being notable examples.
尽管我们可能不知道最近的科技创新能给我们的福利形成多大贡献，但我们至少知道它们不是代表危机前全球经济的金融创新，它们的效果至少是正数。	Although we may not know how much recent technological innovations are contributing to our wellbeing, at least we know that, unlike the wave of financial innovations that marked the pre-crisis global economy, the effect is positive.
相反，支持全球化和开放经济的政策精英必须要让人们看到他们正在解决经济不平等问题并为受变革影响的群体提供调整协助。	Instead, policy elites who support globalization and an open economy will have to be seen to be addressing economic inequality and adjustment assistance for those disrupted by change.

由阿富汗和国际社会共同组成的选举监督委员会中大部分委员由联合国任命 — — 在选举过程中保持一定的威信。	One institution, the Electoral Complaints Commission—a hybrid Afghan-international oversight body with a majority vote controlled by United Nations-appointed commissioners—retained its credibility throughout the process.
最佳融资办法之一是支持国际教育融资便利（International Finance Facility for Education ） ， 这是一个由教育委员会牵头发起的计划，能够释放有史以来最大规模的全球教育投资。	One of the best ways to do this is by supporting the International Finance Facility for Education, an initiative spearheaded by the Education Commission that could unlock the greatest global investment in education ever recorded.

据渔业经济学家的数据，一些世界最富裕国家的补贴是在沿海国家200英里专属经济区外进行大规模工业捕捞有利可图的唯一原因。	According to fisheries economists, subsidies by some of the world’s richest countries are the only reason large-scale industrial fishing in areas beyond coastal countries’ 200-mile exclusive economic zones is profitable.
也许我们需要花数代人的时间才能构建一个切实可行的欧盟范围的政治体系，但是首先第一步是欧盟应该鼓励民众发表他们的观点，不管那可能会多么让人不舒服。	It will probably take several generations before a workable EU-wide political system emerges, but the first step is for the EU to encourage people to have their say, however uncomfortable that may be.
一些人 — — 其实是很多人 — — 永远不会支持他；但作为总统，他有责任接触所有人并提出共同美国价��观的诉求。	Some – indeed many – will never support him; but it is his job, as president, to reach out to all and appeal to the country’s shared values.

但国会僵局的回归可能切断这一趋势，给人们的预期浇下一盆冷水，而对增长起抑制作用的长期趋势（如人口等）也不会消失。	But the return of gridlock in Congress could short-circuit this trend and put a damper on expectations, while growth-constraining secular trends like demographics are not just going to disappear.
但FDIC系统性解决方案咨询委员会（Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee，我也是委员之一）最新的一致意见是对这一论断不能妄加信任。	But the consensus view at the most recent meeting of the FDIC’s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee (of which I am a member) was that this claim should not be taken seriously.
它们面临着这样的观点：美国货币联盟运转得比欧洲好得多，这是因为美国有一个大的联邦预算平滑不对称冲击（即针对个别州的冲击 ） 。	They are facing the argument that the United States’ monetary union works much better because there is a large federal budget to smooth the impact of asymmetric shocks – that is, shocks to individual states.
对外国直接投资和其他非债务资本流动开放可能能够促进经济增长，同时又不会���宏观经济的波动产生负面影响或者带来经济危机。	Opening up to foreign direct investment and other non-debt capital flows may serve to boost economic growth without adverse side effects on macroeconomic volatility or a risk of crisis.
其二，克鲁格曼没有解释为何在2008~2009年被证明有效的凯恩斯主义政策会如此迅速地被财政紧缩政策逆转和取代。	Second, Krugman fails to explain why the Keynesian policies vindicated in 2008-2009 were so rapidly reversed and replaced by fiscal austerity.

但政府官员在大谈紧缩的必要性，鼓励公众为了长期繁荣而做出牺牲，自己却秘密地避免这样做，如此赤裸裸的伪善令人发指地违背了民主国家的信任。	But the sheer hypocrisy of government officials proclaiming the need for austerity and encouraging public sacrifice for the sake of long-term prosperity, while secretly avoiding that effort, is a galling violation of trust in democratic countries.
最糟糕的结果是选出一位与格林斯潘倾向相同的美联储主席 — — 紧紧地抓住数据，垄断决策，并试图威吓同���。	The worst possible outcome would be to pick someone who shares Greenspan’s inclinations – holding data tightly, monopolizing decision-making, and attempting to overawe colleagues.

布什在美索不达米亚的意识形态谎言中浪费了美国很大一部分军力 — — 十年后这些军力在该地区还根本无法补充。	Bush squandered a large part of America’s military strength in Mesopotamia for an ideological fiction – strength that is sorely missed in the region ten years later.
最后，适应效率（adaptive efficiency，即规则如何变化 ） ， 而不是配置效率（allocative efficiency，当下的规则是否最有效 ） ， 是长期增长的关键。	And, finally, adaptive efficiency (how the rules are changed), not allocative efficiency (the most effective rules right now), is the key to long-term growth.
这一相对衰落背后的原因是美国教育体系不能保证对后进美国人的高质量教育，特别是对来自穷人、少数族裔和移民家庭的孩子。	A major factor behind that relative decline has been the US school system’s failure to ensure high-quality education for disadvantaged Americans, particularly children from poor, minority, and immigrant households.
低利率还会鼓励正在做投资的企业将钱投给固定资本，比如高度自动化的机器，这意味着即使经济复苏，失业率也会相对较高。	And low interest rates will encourage firms that do invest to spend on fixed capital like highly automated machines, thereby ensuring that, when recovery comes, it will be relatively jobless.

当执照的价格对二氧化碳的排放量影响力足够大时，国内就会有政治上的呼吁，要求对那些牌照费用较低国家的产品增收进口关税。	When the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions, there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices.
类似的“互相承认”政策可以称为美国-欧盟贸易谈判的关键要素，但这得双方克服存在于监管和政治制度中的偏见才行。	A similar policy of “mutual recognition” could be the key to successful US-EU trade negotiations, but only if both parties can overcome the biases that are built into their regulatory and political systems.
但对于那些支持欧洲央行“以稳定为导向的货币政策 ” （ 这个词暗示其他人无视货币不稳定风险）的人来说，价格稳定目标显然已经变得过于局限。	Yet for those in favor of the ECB’s “stability-oriented monetary policy” – a term suggesting that others disregard the risk of monetary instability – the price-stability objective has evidently become too constraining.
我们所进行的粗略研究表明这些治疗方法 — — 如果没���有效的抗生素，其中许多就无法进行 — — 可以为GDP带来4%的增益。	The broad-brush research we conducted shows that such treatments – many of which would not be possible without effective antibiotics – add around 4% of benefit in terms of GDP.

另外，很难想象在土耳其作为欧盟长期“准成员国”的地位的基础上 ， “ 优惠伙伴关系”的框架还能给它带来多大的优势。	Moreover, it is difficult to imagine what advantages could be offered to Turkey in the framework of a “Privileged Partnership” beyond its long-time status as an Associate Member of the EU.
但是，不那么显而易见的是，这些借款人接着需���来自金融机构的更多的税收诱发的贷款，因为纳税好处让他们自身使用债务变得更廉价了。	But, less obviously, these borrowers then demand more tax-induced lending from financial institutions, because tax benefits make their own use of debt cheaper.
1960年政治独立后，政权就一直在尼日利亚的主要种族¾南方的伊博和约鲁巴、还有北方的豪萨和富拉尼之间循环往复。	Since political independence in 1960, politics has revolved round Nigeria’s major ethnic groups – the Igbo and Yoruba in the south, and the Hausa and Fulani in the north.

由于财政政策无法响应，欧洲央行无法摆脱第二个中介角色：用其Target2系统中和欧洲金融市场按国境线再次分裂的效应。	With fiscal policy incapable of responding, the ECB was stuck with a second intermediation role: mitigating with its Target2 system the effects of European financial markets re-segmenting along national lines.
默克尔有力地宣布伊斯兰教也是德国的宗教，但一些东欧人宣称他们只欢迎少数难民 — — 并且必须是基督教徒。	Whereas Merkel declared forcefully that Islam was also a religion of Germany, some in Eastern Europe have declared that they will welcome only a small number of refugees – and only if they are Christian.
与其他发展中经济体体不同 — — 它们的农民和部落权利从来不会构成开发的障碍 — — 印度政客和非政府组织会挺身而出。	Unlike in some other developing economies, where the rights of farmers or tribals have never stood in the way of development, in India politicians and NGOs took up their cause.
沙特这个自认伊斯兰保守主义大本营且从未将人民民主视为统治合法性来源的国家，其实在某些领域比其他国家手段更为狠辣。	Saudi Arabia, a self-proclaimed bulwark of Islamic conservatism, where popular democracy has never been considered a legitimate form of rule, has been more aggressive in some arenas than in others.
与此同时，金融业也在推进谈判，将此作为摆脱令其讨厌但效率极高的依据弗兰克-多德法案实施的规则的办法。	Meanwhile, the financial industry is pushing the talks as a way to overturn the pesky – and highly effective – rules being implemented in the US under the Dodd-Frank Act.

目前普京的俄罗斯与西方的冲突也是如此：根本上，这是一场西方持有的普世价值与俄罗斯所追求的独特身份之间的碰撞。	The same could be said of the current conflict between Vladimir Putin’s Russia and the West: It is, at root, a collision between the West’s supposedly universal values and Russia’s quest for a distinct identity.
在其他国家，政策制定者们在多年以前就为银行业现代化制定了路线图并从那时开始就强化了竞争—这对于顾客和银行都是有益的。	In other countries, policymakers set the course for banking modernization years ago and have reinforced competition since then – to the benefit of customers and banks alike.
很有说明意义的是 — — 不管在象征意义还是在经济意义上 — — 修宪反对派控制着伊斯坦布尔，而埃尔多安正是凭借着1994年在该市市长选举中胜出步入全国政治舞台的。	It is telling – symbolically and politically – that the amendments’ opponents carried Istanbul, where Erdoğan came to the national stage as mayor-elect in 1994.
中国积极参与阿富汗事务的程度将在很大程度上取决于其能否摒弃当前的这种零和博弈思维，并通过稳定阿富汗局势来协助美国的撤军行动。	The extent to which China will engage Afghanistan positively will depend in large part on whether China rids itself of the prevailing zero-sum mindset and facilitates America’s military withdrawal by doing what it can to stabilize the country.

东京—成功的外交峰会几乎总是周详备至的，会议的各个方面，从一开始的握手到最后的公报，都可以精确到分钟。	TOKYO – Successful diplomatic summits are almost always pre-cooked affairs, with every aspect of the meeting, from the initial handshakes to the final communiqué, minutely choreographed.

在相当现实的层面上，央行的行为永远是“财政政策 ” ， 原因很简单，它们的干���改变了未来政府本金和利息支付的现值。	The actions of central banks have always been “fiscal policy” in a very real sense, simply because their interventions alter the present value of future government principal and interest payments.
事实上，霸权逻辑与当前分裂化和自主化的潮流互相矛盾 — — 比方说巴基斯坦或意大利 — — 由此造成的不平衡和不对等并不总是对强者有利。	Indeed, the logic of hegemony clashes with the current phenomena of fragmentation and autonomization – think of Pakistan, for example, or Italy – which create imbalances and asymmetries that are not always favorable to the powerful.
但埃及 — — 及其战略位置、稳定的边境线、庞大的人口和古老的历史 — — 几百年来一直是阿拉伯世界的主要力量，其决定阿拉伯历史走向的作用无人能及。	But Egypt – with its strategic location, stable borders, large population, and ancient history – has been the principal power of the Arab world for centuries, defining the movement of history there like no other.

在两位领导人让两国不可挽回地陷入未来几十年的可以避免和灾难性的冲突之前，他们应该仔细思考这对于美国和中国，以及整个世界意味着什么。	Before these two leaders irreversibly doom their two countries to spend the next decades locked in a devastating and avoidable conflict, they should carefully consider what that would mean not just for the US and China, but for the entire world.
这一危机的结果是匆忙达成协议，俄罗斯和乌克兰各自在价格上让步，一个神秘莫测的总部设在瑞士、俄罗斯天然气工业公司拥有一半股份的RosUkrEnergo公司从土库曼斯坦输送廉价天然气。	The result was a hastily patched together deal in which Russia and Ukraine each gave ground on price, and a shadowy Swiss-based company half-owned by Gazprom rolled supplies of cheap gas from Turkmenistan into the equation.
鉴于左翼和右翼分歧的象征意义，法国的选民和政治领导者长期以来都一直倾向于以意识形态的词汇来描述这个国家的所有问题。	Given the symbolic power of the left-right divide, France’s voters and political leaders alike have long tended to frame virtually all of the country’s problems in ideological terms.
通过将其货币政策体制转为实现4%的年度通胀 — — 或6%的年度名义GDP增长 — — 美国可以推动欧元区的迅速再平衡。	By shifting its monetary-policy regime to target 4% annual inflation – or 6% annual nominal GDP growth – the US would set in motion rapid rebalancing in the eurozone.
在厄瓜多尔，有意仿效委内瑞拉查韦斯路线的总统拉斐尔·科雷亚（Rafael Correa ） ， 已经取消了自己的连任限制，而国家面临的高通胀风险也越来越大。	In Ecuador, where President Rafael Correa, who seems intent on imitating Venezuelan Chavismo, has eliminated term limits on his office, high inflation is a growing risk.

但在此之前欧洲理事会已经做了很多，不但建立了统一的方针，还将在COP21上将该方针转化为强大的策略和明确的信号。	But it has a lot to do before then, not only to establish a unified approach, but also to translate that approach into strong tactics and a clear message at COP21.
但谁也不相信希腊能在避免大规模社会动乱 — — 说不定还会濒临内战边缘 — — 的情况下作为欧元区成员国实现这一点。	It is inconceivable that Greece could manage that within the eurozone without widespread social unrest, if not conditions approaching those of civil war.
巴勒斯坦人确实已被激怒，但激怒他们的恰恰是以色列的行为 — — 占领导致巴勒斯坦民众权利遭受到永久性的破坏。	Palestinians are indeed being provoked, but by Israeli actions – beginning with the perpetual encroachment on their rights that occupation entails.
毕竟，喙是鸡感知外界环境的主要工具。 但是在此过程中既没有采取麻醉也没有使用止痛药来减轻它们的疼痛。	A hen’s beak is full of nerve tissue – it is, after all, her principal means of relating to her environment – but no anesthetic or analgesic is used to relieve the pain.
但问题不仅在于已经存在的企业；那些尚未存在的企业也同样重要，因为它们从未成立也从未扩张（如果情况相反，南非就不会缺少民众正在寻找的900万份工作 ） 。	The problem, however, is not only the firms that exist; equally important are those that do not, because they were never founded or did not expand (if they had, South Africa would not be lacking the nine million jobs its people are seeking).
在1952年的总统竞选中，德怀特·艾森豪威尔（Dwight Eisenhower）和他未来的国务卿约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯（John Foster Dulles）就曾对遏制策略嗤之以鼻，并号召要在东欧地区将苏联“彻底打垮 ” 。	In the 1952 presidential election campaign, Dwight Eisenhower and his future secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, heaped scorn on containment, calling instead for a “rollback” of the Soviets in Eastern Europe.
事实上，由于成年人无法卸下他们应有的对儿童的责任，大失所望的年轻人正在构建禁止童婚区、成立反奴隶集团、组织教育权利运动。	Indeed, frustrated with adults’ failure to discharge what should be their duties toward children, young people are forming child-marriage-free zones, launching anti-slavery groups, and organizing education-rights campaigns.
毕竟，当刘在2010年被授予诺贝尔奖以及被激怒的中国试图惩罚挪威时，西方并没有表达愤怒，也没有展现出与北约盟友的真正团结。	After all, when Liu was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010, and an infuriated China attempted to ostracize Norway, the West did not express outrage or display real solidarity with a NATO ally.
今年德国的绿色补贴将耗资236亿美元，居民电价从2000年来上涨了80 % ， 导致690万家庭陷入能源贫困。	In Germany, where green subsidies will cost €23.6 billion this year, household electricity prices have increased by 80% since 2000, causing 6.9 million households to live in energy poverty.
相对繁荣和自由的前景对于乌克兰人来说太有吸引力了，以至于他们推翻了更偏好俄罗斯领导的“欧亚同盟”而放弃欧盟入盟协定的总统。	The prospect of relative prosperity and freedom proved so attractive to the people of Ukraine that they toppled a president who preferred a Russian-led “Eurasian Union” to an EU association agreement.
美国剑桥—尽管最近一些成员国表现出好转迹象，但欧元区经济仍然不尽如人意，预计今年总体GDP年增长率将略高于1 % 。	CAMBRIDGE – Despite the recent upturn in some of its member countries, the eurozone’s economy remains in the doldrums, with the overall rate of annual GDP growth this year likely to be only slightly higher than 1%.
许多人怀疑一些欧盟成员国一方面在与有虐待囚犯记录的国家谈判双边协定时要求加入强健的人权条款，一方面又秘密帮助恐怖主义嫌犯引渡回这些国家。	Many suspect that some EU member states, while insisting on robust human-rights clauses in bilateral agreements with countries known to torture prisoners, secretly aided in the rendition of suspected terrorists to these same countries.
新一轮刺激政策能即刻调动中国的过剩产能和未充分利用的经费（比方说已经完工的不动产资产 ） ， 重现年度GDP 9%的增速。	With a new round of stimulus, China’s excess production capacity and underused outlays (for example, built-up real-estate assets) could be mobilized immediately, restoring 9% annual GDP growth.
至于土耳其，它似乎走曾在通往自由民主的路上，尽管很多人指责埃尔多安逮捕记者和将军；而如今，全世界都看到它在开倒车。	Turkey, for its part, seemed to be on a path toward true liberal democracy, notwithstanding the criticism of those who pointed to Erdoğan’s jailing of journalists and generals; it is now backsliding for all the world to see.
阿尔及尔—尽管健康每况愈下，阿尔及利亚总统阿卜杜拉齐兹·波特弗利卡（Abdelaziz Bouteflika）仍在本月第四次当选总统，支持率高达81 % — —至少他的政府是这么宣布的。	ALGIERS – Despite his failing health, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika won a fourth term last month, with 81% of the vote – or so the regime claimed.
（从理论上讲，在劳动力丰富的中国和印度，资本家可能成为输家。 但在现实中，由于其政府成功的同步自由化和全球化，他们也受益匪浅。	(In theory, capitalists in labor-abundant China and India could end up as losers, but in practice they, too, have benefited thanks to their governments’ success in simultaneously liberalizing and globalizing.)
但现实世界中有机农业产量低下（一般比传统农业减产20-50 % ） — — 为农田带来重重压力，并导致用水量大幅提高。	But the low yields of organic agriculture in real-world settings – typically 20-50% below yields from conventional agriculture – impose various stresses on farmland and increase water consumption substantially.
巴西近年来已经习惯了快速增长的经济状况，却在2015到2016年经历了一次大规模的经济衰退，2018年看来又将成为一个惨淡的年份。	Brazil, having only recently become accustomed to the status of a fast-growing economy, experienced a massive recession in 2015-2016, and 2018 is shaping up to be another bleak year.
但因为非国大目前显然决心用该党新领袖西里尔·拉马福萨来取代雅各布·祖马（Jacob Zuma）总统丑闻缠身的政府，人们有理由充满希望。	Yet, with the African National Congress now apparently determined to replace President Jacob Zuma’s scandal-ridden administration with one led by the party’s new leader, Cyril Ramaphosa, there is reason for hope.
在过去，由于交易成本过高，即使中国制造的产品，其在中国的价格仍可能高于美国。 而电子支付对降低中国营商和交易成本非常关键，大大提高了零售业的效率。	E-payments are a key factor in lowering business and transaction costs in China, because they improve efficiency in the retail sector, where prices can still be higher than in the US even when the products are made in China.
在一致性等于质量的假设下，大小和颜色异常的（比如）西红柿被认为是劣等的（除非有人称它们是“传家宝”西红柿，强调它们的独特性 ） 。	Under the assumption that consistency equals quality, variation in the size or color of, say, tomatoes has come to be considered bad (unless one calls them “heirloom” tomatoes and emphasizes their uniqueness).
尽管中产阶级所面临的挑战早已耳熟能详，美国领导人始终无法充分理解中产阶级家庭的困难，更不用说实施有效的应对手段了。	Though the challenges facing the middle class are well documented, US leaders have largely failed to recognize fully the struggles of middle-class households, much less implement effective countermeasures.
在未来几年中，俄国将提供给欧洲很大的机会进行更为紧密的合作，但是，它也会在干涉欧洲事务上构成更多的风险。	In the next few years, Russia will offer Europe a great opportunity for closer cooperation, but it will also pose a risk of increased intrusion in European affairs.
而与此同时,也有一个与上述道德观相对立的理念，认为虽然过度负债固然不对，但真正应该被谴责的其实不是借债者，而是放债者。	But there is a contrary moral attitude, the essence of which is that, whereas excessive debt is to be deplored, the blame for it lies with the lender, not the borrower.
富人阶层当然付得起更高的税收，但如果政府对富人增税，就应该将着眼点放在改善所有人的机会上，而不是将增税视为对假想责任人的惩罚措施。	The rich can certainly afford to pay more, but if governments increase taxes on the wealthy, they should do it with the aim of improving opportunities for all, rather than as a punitive measure to rectify an imagined wrong.
而这个网络的破碎和肢解 — — 通过对金融机构的恐慌和敌意，低价甩卖资产，信贷紧缩等 — — 将成为对金融监管这和货币主管部门的噩梦。	The unraveling of such a network – through panic and runs against financial institutions, asset fire sales, credit crunches, and the like – then becomes a nightmare for financial supervisors and monetary authorities alike.
虽然他们承认低社会流动性是源自于经济上的限制因素，但他们仍然跟被分享数据前一样反对政府干预和再分配。	While they acknowledged that low social mobility is economically limiting, they remained as averse to government intervention and redistribution as they were before we shared the data with them.
但是，除了IMF的改革计划之外，如果政府的政策框架对头，那么埃及还可以从私人部门获得资源，包括有利于就业创造和经济发展的外国投资。	But, apart from an IMF-backed reform program, if the Egyptian government’s policy framework is right, resources will flow from the private sector, including foreign investment supportive of job creation and economic development.
而当民粹主义者拥有起草新宪法的��会时，他们为什么不借此打击根据定义必然是由人民的敌人（常常被指责为外国势力的走狗）组成的反对派呢？	And when populists have an opportunity to write a new constitution, why should they not ride roughshod over any opposition, which, by definition, must comprise the enemies of the people (who often are accused of being foreign agents)?
首先，欧盟应该在最大化各成员国海军的效能方面扮演带头角色，建立一些可以便利各国政府，各国海军机构和海军之间信息交流的机制。	First, the EU should take a leading role in maximizing the efficiency of each member state’s navy, by creating mechanisms that would facilitate the exchange of information between governments, maritime agencies, and navies.
如今，美国市场上充斥着廉价的国产天然气，其中一部分LNG出口至欧洲，给俄罗斯和挪威等传统出口国带来了意料之外的竞争。	Now, with the US market cordoned off by cheap domestic gas, some of that LNG is going to Europe, introducing unexpected competition for traditional suppliers Russia and Norway.
长此以往，这些状况的持续破坏了国内产业的竞争力，不但妨碍了巴西产品的国际销路，就连在国内市场的稳步增长都无法保证。	Over time, the persistence of these conditions undermined the competitiveness of domestic industry, impeding sales of Brazilian products not only internationally, but also in the robust and growing internal market.
此外，日渐增多的反抗反映了公众意识到当局已经开始害怕民众的力量，当面对愤怒的抗议者时趋向于对他们的要求让步。	Moreover, growing defiance reflects the public’s perception that the authorities have grown afraid of the people and tend to yield to their demands when confronted by angry protesters.
今天，空气中二氧化碳的浓度比工业革命初期提高了近40 % — —根据南极冰盖的钻探记录，毫无疑问已经达到了过去一百万年来的峰值。	Today, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is 40% higher than it was at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution – by far the highest it has been during the past one million years, as we know from drilling into the Antarctic ice.
如果土耳其赋予国内库尔德少数民族更多的文化和语言权利，允许库尔德政治权利在土耳其议会中合法存在，就会削减土耳其库尔德人反对安卡拉的意愿。	If Turkey grants its own Kurdish minority more cultural and language rights and allows legitimate Kurdish political representation in the Turkish parliament, the willingness of Turkish Kurds to oppose Ankara will be diminished.
我们知道，土耳其军中有着庞大的居伦派（否则早先政府针对土耳其高级官员的举动 — — 所谓的艾尔格尼肯和铁锤案（Eregenekon and Sledgehammer cases ） — —也不会进行 ） 。	We know that there is a strong Gülenist presence in the military (without which the government’s earlier move against senior Turkish officers – the so-called Eregenekon and Sledgehammer cases – could not have been mounted).
首先，总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德（François Hollande）担心欧元会对其他世界主要货币升值，并呼吁设定汇率目标。	First, President François Hollande, worried about the euro’s appreciation against other major world currencies, called for an exchange-rate target.
比如，在许多亚洲国家 — — 包括印度、中国和巴基斯坦 — — 由于过度开采和能源补贴，地下水水位以值得警惕的速度下降。	For example, in many Asian countries – including India, China, and Pakistan – groundwater levels are declining at an alarming rate, owing to over-extraction and energy subsidies.
不过，虽然他在当选后继续采取相对缓和的政策，但他甚至都没有费心去争取快速贸易促进的权力，更不用说为多哈回合全球贸易谈判注入生命力了。	But, while he has continued his softer tone since the election, he has not even bothered to ask for fast-track trade-promotion authority, let alone try to pump new life into the Doha Round of global trade talks.
在拉丁美洲，阿根廷和墨西哥两国都在控制腐败和保持透明度的国家名单中排名垫底 — — 它们的排名比巴西要低得多。	In Latin America, Argentina and Mexico both rank among the bottom half of countries in controlling corruption and maintaining transparency – much lower than Brazil.
这种情况下，委员会的传统弱点 — — 即外交和能源政策通常由各成员国自主决定 — — 可能转化为一项重要的优势。	In this context, one of the commission’s traditional weaknesses – that foreign and energy policies are usually decided by individual member states – could serve as an important advantage.
从这个意义上讲，就业与冲突具有相关性，但重要的却不是绝对的就业水平，而是好工作在不同宗教或种族团体之间的分配状况。	In this sense, employment is relevant, but what matters is not the absolute level of employment so much as the distribution of good jobs among religious or ethnic groups.
今天，土耳其正在中东执行一种拥有正义感的政策，并致力于移除横亘在该地区人民之间的所有人造边界和围墙。	Today, Turkey is following a policy that represents a sense of justice in the Middle East, and is working toward the removal of artificial borders and walls among the region’s peoples.
各类在线平台降低了搜索和匹配成本，这解放了技能市场（被称为“栅格（gig）经济 ” ） 和未利用资产市场（被称为“共享经济 ” ） 。	The reduced search and matching costs offered by a range of online platforms are unlocking the market for skills (known as the “gig economy”) and the market for underutilized assets (known as the “sharing economy”).
近年来，许多欧洲专家试图论证货币政策也应把资产价格纳入考虑范围，美国的政策制定者和经济学家却普遍抵制这一观点。	Many Europeans tried to argue in recent years that monetary policy should also take asset-price developments into account, whereas American policymakers and academics largely resisted this approach.
说到底，重振美国破败的基础设施需要我们所谓的“进步联邦主义 ” ： 利用各级政府的优势，与私人部门合作解决紧迫的社会和经济挑战。	Ultimately, restoring America’s failing infrastructure will require what we call “progressive federalism”: harnessing the strengths of each level of government and working with the private sector to address pressing social and economic challenges.
但这需要释放更多信贷 — — 而专注于清理现有坏账、强迫银行行为审慎化的央行对这一要求多次不予理会。	But this would require the release of more credit – a condition that the central bank, focused on cleaning up existing bad debts and forcing banks to act more prudently, has repeatedly disregarded.
尽管中国日益增长的金融实力可能会让其更有能力回拒美国的乞求，尽管有那些可怕的预测，但是中国作为债权人的角色不足以逼迫美国改变它的政策。	China’s increased financial power may have increased its ability to resist American entreaties, but despite dire predictions, its creditor role has not been sufficient to compel the US to change its policies.
有些人甚至说这一事故对于苏联的经济代价高的让它停止了军备竞赛，因为我无法再花钱清理切尔诺贝利的同时继续扩充军备。	Some even suggest that the economic price for the USSR was so high that it stopped the arms race, as I could not keep building arms while paying to clean up Chernobyl.
美国此前从未有过没有从政或从军经验的总统，也未有过如此将逃避真相、采用阴谋论和自相矛盾当成家常便饭的总统。	The US has never before had a president with no political or military experience, nor one who so routinely shirks the truth, embraces conspiracy theories, and contradicts himself.
饱受争议的作者迈克尔·沃尔夫（Michael Wolff）如何获得某些信息仍不清楚，但想必他对很多采访录了音，特别是那些用在书中的长对话。	It’s not yet clear how Michael Wolff, the book’s controversial author, obtained some of his information, but it must be assumed that he taped many of his interviews, particularly those used for the long conversations found throughout the book.
桑德斯曾在2009年试图（失败地）阻挠这一任命。 出乎许多前华尔街同事的意料，詹斯勒上任后花了五年时间大力实施金融监管立法，包括对衍生品进行激进监管。	In that position, to the consternation of many former Wall Street colleagues, Gensler spent five years working vigorously to implement financial-reform legislation, including pursuing the aggressive regulation of derivatives.
中国还有可能开始软化其台湾立场，因为台湾“总统”蔡英文的亲独立的民进党在上个月的地方政府选举中惨败。	And China may begin to moderate its stance on Taiwan, given the poor results of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party in last month’s local government elections.
克林顿是否可以通过取得决定性胜利 — — 从而趁热打铁 — — 帮助下级（down-ballot）候选人或通过更多的时间和金钱个别助选仍有待观察。	It’s an open question whether Clinton could do more for down-ballot candidates by winning decisively – so that the enthusiasm trickles down – or by expending time and money to help those candidates individually.
它巩固了其印度洋与太平洋之间的战略通道。 这条同道贡献了全球海路贸易的三分之一 — — 去年价值高达5.3万亿美元。	It has consolidated its control over the strategic corridor between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, through which one-third of global maritime trade – worth $5.3 trillion last year – passes.
起初，穆斯林兄弟会在推翻穆尔西前任胡斯尼·穆巴拉克的大规模民众抗议运动后上台执政点燃了重塑埃伊外交关系的希望。	Initially, the Muslim Brotherhood’s ascent to power in the aftermath of the massive popular protests that toppled Morsi’s predecessor, Hosni Mubarak, inspired hope of renewed diplomatic ties with Iran.
也许更重要的是，中国当局目前更依赖有丰富实践经验的一批体制内智囊及中央与地方干部来设计其国家发展路线图，而不是靠传统的党内意识形态理论家。	Perhaps more important, it has relied on seasoned intellectuals and policymakers – not Party ideologues – to design its development roadmap.
发自拉马拉 — — 美国应当停止重启巴以和平进程的努力，而这样做或许是实现和平的最佳方式 — — 一个反映了和平进程与实现真正和平之间巨大鸿沟的矛盾困境。	RAMALLAH – The United States should stop pushing for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. Doing so might be the best way to achieve peace – a paradox that reflects the huge gap between a peace process and achieving genuine peace.
《华盛顿邮报》最近发表了一篇由四部分组成的系列文章，揭示了针对华尔街、穆斯林、贸易协议、华盛顿、警察枪击、奥巴马总统、共和党、移民和其他目标的群众愤怒。	The Washington Post recently published a four-part series of articles revealing popular fury aimed at Wall Street, Muslims, trade deals, Washington, police shootings, President Barack Obama, Republicans, immigrants, and other targets.
当然，如今的城市区域已经变得巨大，分散以及多元化，因此如果说一座城市拥有一种足以影响其居民集体生活的精神气质，那未免会令人生疑了。	Of course, today’s urban areas are huge, diverse, and pluralistic, so it may seem strange to say that a modern city has an ethos that informs its residents’ collective life.
布宜诺斯艾利斯 — — 智利从20世纪80年代起就一直是拉美的成功典范，实现了快速的经济发展、与世界经济的成功融合、建立了可靠的民主制度、高效的国家官僚体系并且拥有低水平的腐败。	BUENOS AIRES – Chile has been Latin America’s success story since the 1980’s, boasting rapid economic growth, successful integration into the world economy, solid democratic institutions, an effective state bureaucracy, and low levels of corruption.
此外，与男性拥有的企业相比，女性拥有的企业往往更小，雇员人数更少，更集中于盈利和增长机会有限的行业。	And, compared to businesses owned by men, enterprises owned by women are smaller, employ fewer people, and are more concentrated in sectors with limited opportunities for profit and growth.
但是这样的降税所带来的效果，即使不是完全地，那也是在很大程度上转瞬即逝的 — — 尤其是当福利承诺被节省了的时候。	But the effectiveness of such tax cuts would be largely, if not wholly, transitory – especially if the welfare state was spared.
该数据覆盖的是非代理住房抵押贷款，这与和解所针对的贷款并不相同，而且数据来自多家银行，所以我们并不知道哪些银行参与其中。	The data cover non-agency residential mortgages, which are not the same as those targeted by the settlement, and the data come from a pool of banks, so we do not know which banks were present.
伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）毫无疑问是2016年总统候选人当中思想最为新潮的，也是千禧一代选民心中的英雄，他已经75岁了。	Bernie Sanders, certainly the freshest mind of all the 2016 presidential candidates and the hero of millennial voters, is 75.
他试图使共产主义变的更人性化，并把正统斯大林主义者的残酷行径矫正过来。 但他从不怀疑列宁主义就是通向未来的道路。	He tried to humanize it and undo the cruelty of Stalinist orthodoxy, but never doubted that the Leninist system was the way of the future.
新报告强调了在《对生活的错误测量》中只是略作提及的几个方面，如信任和不安全，也更加深入地探讨了一些其他方面，如不平等性和可持续性。	The new report highlights several topics, like trust and insecurity, which had been only briefly addressed by Mismeasuring Our Lives, and explores several others, like inequality and sustainability, more deeply.
国内投资也在稳步上升，因为企业似乎相信现有的政治和安全挑战也就是科索沃独立后以及波斯尼亚的不安定可能造成的负面影响将很快被克服。	Inward investment is steadily rising, as business seems to believe that the remaining political and security challenges – the possible negative effects of post-independence Kosovo and Bosnia’s malaise – will be overcome sooner rather than later.
然而熟悉人民党的人都知道，它对泰姬陵的袭击只不过是该党仇恨政治方针的体现：这些人反对与穆斯林统治印度历史有关的一切事物。	And yet anyone familiar with the BJP knows that its attacks on the Taj are just one manifestation of the party’s politics of hatred toward anything connected to the history of Muslim rule in India.
发自华盛顿特区 — — 众所周知，苏丹已经走到了和平与内战的分叉路口上，一旦开战，势必会上演一场本年度最为血腥的常规战争。	WASHINGTON, DC – Sudan sits at the proverbial crossroads between potential peace and possible nationwide conflict, which would undoubtedly become the world’s deadliest conventional war in 2011.
武装激进分子去年夏天打击了埃及驻西奈半岛前哨部队并杀害16名士兵，这表明恐怖主义对埃及的威胁不亚于以色列。	The attack on an Egyptian army outpost in the Sinai last summer, in which armed militants killed 16 soldiers, demonstrated that terrorism threatens Egypt just as it does Israel.
为了避免这一幕发生，欧元区核心国将被迫采取第四和第五选择：给外围国好处，让它们维持低增长、低竞争力现状。	Avoiding it would compel the eurozone's core economies to embrace the fourth and final option: bribing the periphery to remain in a low-growth uncompetitive state.
一个流行的解释是一个叫作“长期停滞”的模糊概念 — — 长期受到抑制的商品和服务需求破坏了投资和招聘激励。	One popular explanation lies in the fuzzy notion of “secular stagnation”: long-term depressed demand for goods and services is undermining incentives to invest and hire.
相反，莫迪政府计划追求亲增长日程，包括减��官僚拖延、增加基础设施投资、刺激制造业活动、向统一的简化税收制度转型等。	By contrast, the Modi government plans to pursue a pro-growth agenda that includes reducing bureaucratic delays, increasing infrastructure investment, stimulating manufacturing activity, and shifting to a simpler unified tax system.
1958年到1985年期间，大约5万名苏联作家、记者、官员、音乐家、舞蹈家、运动员和学者访问了美国。	Some 50,000 Soviets – writers, journalists, officials, musicians, dancers, athletes, and academics – visited the United States between 1958 and 1988.
当足够比例的债权人批准重组计划时（在阿根廷的例子中，90%的该国债务持有人同意重组 ） ， 其他人也将被迫同意。	When a sufficient proportion of creditors agree to a restructuring plan (in the case of Argentina, the holders of more than 90% of the country’s debt did), the others can be forced to go along.
而在关塔纳摩湾一案中，布什政府申辩说有利于被拘押者的判决会使人力和物力从战场上转移到法庭中，从而削弱美国的战斗力。	In the Guantanamo Bay case, by contrast, the Bush Administration argued that a ruling for the detainees would undermine the war effort by diverting manpower and material from the battlefield to the courtroom.
鲁哈尼在2013年第一次当选时也受益于高投票率，如今他又完成了一项“壮举 ” — —避免了在在任总统身上常常发生的投票参与率下降的现象。	Rouhani, who also benefited from high turnout when he was first elected in 2013, has the added distinction of avoiding the decline in voter-participation rates that is common for incumbents.
如今，生活在波哥大、蒙得维的亚、圣保罗或圣地亚哥市郊的中产阶级，他们的平均收入（美元值）仍远低于北美或欧洲。	Today, a middle-class family living on the outskirts of Bogotá, Montevideo, São Paulo, or Santiago has an average income that is much lower in dollar terms than that of its counterparts in North America or Europe.
就像凯南所说的那样，美国发动战争时并不是为了自己的核心利益，但对手的情况却恰恰相反，因此我们的对手一定会英勇奋战，一直到战争由于持续的时间过长而在美国民众中失去支持。	As Kennan explained, when America goes to war over something less than a vital interest, the adversary – for whom vital interests are at stake – will fight long after the war has become too unpopular at home to sustain.
这一偏好可以追溯到20世纪50年代的大跃进，在这场运动中，为了满足太过于乐观的钢铁产量目标，进而实现毛泽东的快速工业化梦想，炼出了大量废金属。	This predilection harkens back to the Great Leap Forward of the 1950s, when scrap metal was melted to meet wildly optimistic steel-production targets, thereby advancing Mao’s dream of rapid industrialization.
这样一来，财政赤字货币化可能会成为受到抵制最少的折中方案，毕竟，开动印钞机比削减赤字在政治上容易多了。	Monetizing the fiscal deficits would then become the path of least resistance: running the printing presses is much easier than politically painful deficit reduction.
但就连该校最狂热的支持者（该校的支持者不乏其人）也无法确定如果被禁止自主招生，该校是否还能取得同样的优异成绩。	Not even the school’s most enthusiastic boosters – of which there are many – could argue with any certainty that it could produce such impressive results if it could not select its own students.
此外，研究表明在教室中使用笔记本电脑会学生学习进程放慢，即使他们用笔记本电脑来记笔记而不是网络冲浪。	Moreover, research shows that laptops in the classroom slow student learning, even when used to take notes, rather than surf the web.
世界最佳企业 — — 它们拥有最高的生产率、利润和工资，并投资于强化人力资本 — — 都是贸易冠军，这绝非巧合。	It is no accident that the world’s best firms – which have the highest productivity, profits, and wages, and invest in strengthening human capital – are trade champions.
华盛顿—两年前，特斯拉CEO艾龙·马斯克（Elon Musk）决定向所有人开放公司专利 — — 这一做法与传统竞争行为完全背道而驰。	WASHINGTON, DC – Two years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk decided to open access to his company’s patents to anyone – a move that ran completely counter to traditional competitive behavior.
但是，这产生了计划之外的后果。 当大量的资本流入和宽松的美联储政策结合在一起的时候，美国监管者没能收紧资本和贷款标准，这引燃了一个极度的信贷繁荣。	But there were unintended consequences. The failure of US regulators to tighten capital and lending standards when abundant capital inflows combined with loose Fed policies ignited a furious credit boom.
这也许令人不快，但大都会的崛起是一个事实 — — 对于这一事实，我们不应该抵制，因为这不是一个零和博弈。	Inconvenient as it may be, the rise of the metropolis is a fact – one that should not be resisted, because it is not a zero-sum game.
总统奥巴马再三提及的观点 — — “我们需要在国内建设国家 ” ， 及其未雨绸缪地部署无人机，都表明他宁可走不左不右的孤立道路。	President Barack Obama’s oft-stated view that “we need some nation building at home,” combined with his antiseptic waging of drone warfare, indicates that he is erring on the side of the isolationists of both the left and the right.
但如果巴西的经济想要发展到下一个阶段，公共和个人执法力需要得到提高。 大幅提高法律目前为止并没有奠定巴西的整体经济增长。	While public and private enforcement will need to improve if Brazil’s economy is to move to the next level, dramatic legal improvement has not underpinned Brazil’s overall financial development so far.
毕竟，过去造成的投资短缺必须得到弥补，与此同时，还要进行面向未来的投资，因此当下的一代就不得不背负起双重负担。	After all, past investment shortfalls have to be made up and future-oriented investments undertaken simultaneously – a double burden that must be borne by the current generation.
这与我们当前面对的形势也是大相径庭：美国的增长远远谈不上强劲，欧洲各国也明确表示并不急于与英国展开任何贸易谈判。	Here, too, the current situation could not be more different. US growth is far from robust, and EU countries have made clear that they are in no hurry to negotiate a trade deal with the UK.
尽管仍低于2001年9月11日恐怖袭击后测得的46 % ， 但其比例却创下了近10年来美国人提到恐怖主义的新高。	This is the highest percentage of Americans to mention terrorism in a decade, although it is still lower than the 46% measured after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
恰恰相反 ， “ 自由从本质上来讲必须由人民自己去选择和捍卫，并得到法治和少数民族共同的维护 。 ”	Instead, “Freedom by its nature must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities.”
事实上，许多观察家认为，希腊与其债权人所达成的第三次援助方案协议 — — 在瓦鲁法基斯辞职不到一周时签署 — — 只不过是前两次的重复。	Indeed, many observers view the agreement on a third bailout program that Greece reached with its creditors – barely a week after Varoufakis resigned – as simply more of the same.
大部分经济学家都同意，如果将赤字用于支付必要的基础设施和教育改善，或者强化国内实体和网络安全，那么增加赤字是有意义的。	Most economists agree that larger deficits make sense if used to pay for necessary infrastructure and education improvements, not to mention enhancing domestic physical and cyber security.
在全世界领导人准备实施最有雄心的全球代办事项清单之际 — — 可持续发展目标将从1月1日开始开始 — — 决定从哪里开始也许是一个艰巨的任务。	As world leaders prepare to enact the most ambitious global to-do list yet – the Sustainable Development Goals will be launched on January 1 – deciding where to begin may seem a daunting task.
他甚至曾经委托联合国进行一项研究，分析为什么在亚洲和拉丁美洲成功引导数百万人脱贫并加速经济转型的“绿色革命”在非洲却未能实现。	He even commissioned a study for the UN to analyze why “green revolutions” – agricultural reforms in Asia and Latin America that lifted millions out of poverty and accelerated economic transformations – had bypassed Africa.
开始时，所有欧洲国家可能都认为：那些非欧洲的外来者应该完全融入欧洲的文化，就像19世纪的波兰移民融入到德国鲁尔地区的文化当中一样。	All European countries probably believed at the outset that non-European newcomers could be assimilated in the same way that Polish immigrants were assimilated into Germany’s Ruhr region in the nineteenth century.
在第比利斯、基辅和比什凯克 ， “ 色彩”革命的领导者早已在政权中身居高位，但他们现在反过来攻击执政政权，指责它腐败透顶。 尽管虚伪，他们仍然成功地赢得了公众的信任。	In Tbilisi, Kiev, and Bishkek, the leaders of the “color revolutions” had already held lofty positions in regimes that they now attacked as thoroughly corrupt; yet they succeeded in gaining the population’s trust.
只有暴力才会逆转这一进程，但是不大可能，因为黎巴嫩需要一位新的总统的认同度是如此之高，所有黎巴嫩人民对武力的抵触心理是如此的根深蒂固。	This can only be reversed by violence, which is unlikely, so strong is the consensus that Lebanon needs a new president, and so ingrained is the rejection of force by all Lebanese.
从军事上来说，欧洲国家需要更多地在安全通讯、空运能力、特种行动以及在化学和生物战争领域的行动中投入更多，以有效地应对反恐战争。	In military terms, European countries need to spend more on secure communications, airlift capabilities, special operations, and dealing with chemical and biological battlefields in order to be able to fight the war on terrorism effectively.
事实上，增长和收入差距之间的关系并不简单；毕竟，收入差距在增长缓慢的发达国家和快速增长的发展中国家都有扩大的趋势。	In fact, there is no simple relationship between growth and income inequality; after all, inequality has been increasing in both slow-growing developed economies and fast-growing emerging economies.
再加上中国、阿拉伯国家和拉美国家以投资和贷款形式投入的大笔支出，流向发展中国家的官方发展援助显然已经达到史无前例的金额。	Add to this total the substantial spending by China, Arab states, and Latin American countries in the form of investments and loans, and it is clear that flows of ODA toward the developing world have reached unprecedented levels.
特朗普的许多政策重点 — — 包括税收改革、一些去监管措施、军事建设、基础设施投资以及撤销和替换平价医疗法 — — 都需要立法。	Many of Trump’s policy priorities – including tax reform, some deregulation, a military build-up, infrastructure spending, and the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act – will require legislation.
事实上，2012年卡塔赫纳（Cartagena）美洲峰会成了一次抨击美国的大会，各国威胁，如果2015年不邀请古巴与会，就抵制峰会。	Indeed, the 2012 Summit of the Americas in Cartagena became an exercise in America-bashing, with countries threatening to boycott the 2015 summit if Cuba was not invited.
它的历史和政府一样久远，但和其他犯罪一样，它在过去几十年里变得越来越复杂，给无数无辜公民的福祉和尊严带来了灾难性的影响。	It has existed as long as government has; but, like other crimes, it has grown increasingly sophisticated over the last several decades, with devastating effects on the wellbeing and dignity of countless innocent citizens.
但其他国家为何要模仿这个大量人口 — — 甚至可以说是大部分人口 — — 收入停滞不前、眼睁睁看着顶层收入狂飙突进的经济模式呢？	But why would others seek to emulate an economic model by which a large proportion – even a majority – of the population has seen their income stagnate while incomes at the top have soared?
尽管完善的知识是无法得到的，但是我们可以通过思辩而获得对现实更好的理解。 开放社会就是建立在这一认识基础之上。	That fact casts doubt on Karl Popper’s concept of open society, which is based on the recognition that, while perfect knowledge is unattainable, we can gain a better understanding of reality by engaging in critical thinking.
类似地，印度因为伯南克暗示美联储将“减弱”QE而严重受创，但这只是因为其经济出现了高通胀和庞大的预算和外部赤字。	Likewise, India was severely affected by Bernanke’s suggestion that the Fed would “taper” QE, but only because its economy was characterized by high inflation and large budget and external deficits.
他虚与委蛇的发言几乎完全没有透露他将采取怎样的外交政策，也没有多少理由可以相信，当他的方针变得明确时，我们将看到美国 — — 或者说全世界—正需要的政策。	His muddled statements offer little insight into what kind of foreign policy he will actually pursue, and there is not much reason to believe that, when his approach does become clear, it will be what the United States – or the world – needs.
但伊朗领导人对其他可能仍持怀疑态度，尽管美国的官方立场是将“动用台面上的一切选择”来防止伊朗发展核武器。	But Iran’s leaders remain skeptical of either scenario, despite America’s official position that “all options are on the table” to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability.
比如，前财务省高级官员宫本一三（Ichizo Miyamoto）表示，计入政府资产，日本的净债务/GDP比率不到100 % ， 与美国相当。	For example, Ichizo Miyamoto, a former senior finance-ministry official, claims that, accounting for the government’s assets, Japan’s net debt/GDP ratio is below 100%, similar to that of the United States.
海洋废物每年要导致一百万海鸟和100,000海生哺乳动物（海豹、鲸鱼和海豚）因为溺水、窒息或饥饿而死去。	Marine debris causes the death by drowning, suffocation, or starvation of some one million seabirds and around 100,000 marine mammals (seals, whales, and dolphins) every year, not to mention the hazard posed to shipping by sea junk.
由于快速城市化 — — 截止2050年，高达70%的人将生活在城市 — — 暴露在更高污染水平中的人群占比正在迅速攀升。	Given rapid urbanization – up to 70% of all people will live in cities by 2050 – the rate of exposure to higher levels of pollution is rising rapidly.
而后者有着很多医生专攻不同领域（肿瘤学，心脏病学，神经内科等等 ） ， 使医院能够提供更多样化的治疗。	In the latter, doctors specialize in different areas (oncology, cardiology, neurology, and so on), which enables the hospital to offer a more diverse set of interventions.
我们的目标应当是确保所有需要药物的人都能够以低廉的价格拿到它；其中包括高危人群，如医疗卫生工作者、艾滋病毒/艾滋病感染者，结核病是导致后者死亡的主要原因。	The goal should be to ensure that medicines are accessible and affordable for anyone who needs them; this includes high-risk populations such as health-care workers, as well as people living with HIV/AIDS, for whom TB is a leading cause of death.
正如2006年斯特恩评论（Stern Review）所强调的，我们必须牺牲一些今天的增长，以确保明天的收成。	As the Stern Review of 2006 emphasized, we must sacrifice some growth today to ensure that we do not all fry tomorrow.
从短期看，铁腕人物奈伊夫成为王储将进一步增加沙特王国的高压，比如巩固强硬的瓦哈比派牧师在沙特权力网中的地位。	In the short term, the iron-fisted Naif, as Crown Prince, will push the Kingdom into greater repression, in part by strengthening the hardline Wahhabi clerics’ place in the country’s power nexus.
除了耗资数十亿纳税人的钱之外，保尔森的计划还违反了资本主义的基本原则，即获得的收益的人也须承担损失。	Aside from costing billions of taxpayer dollars, Paulson’s plan violates the fundamental capitalist principle that whoever reaps the gains also bears the losses.
在某种程度上，祖马在给予那些心灵每天都会被阶层差异刺痛以及渴望物质利益的广大民众权利的同时，他还必须找到一个实践自己那一代人所作的种族公正和民族解放承诺的途径。	Somehow Zuma must find a way to honor his own generation’s commitment to racial justice and national liberation, while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain.
由于这个不讲信誉的政权使用犬儒主义政策和暗藏恶意的花言巧语，使得现在我们必须领导的这个国家中的一些法令与我们所寻求建立的民主制度背道而驰。	Now we must lead a nation in which – thanks to the cynical ploys and hate-filled rhetoric of a discredited regime – some sections seem to be set against the democracy we seek to build.
当2003年埃尔多安首次当选总理时，全球经济蓬勃发展巩固了他的地位，促使他大胆地开始对土耳其政体进行改革。	When Erdoğan first became prime minister in 2003, his position was bolstered by booming global growth, emboldening him to start transforming the Turkish polity.
我们唯一在每次比赛中都是冠军的是国际象棋大师阿南德（Vishwanathan Anand ） — —但是国际象棋也不是奥运会比赛项目，并且国际象棋比赛要求的是脑力而不是体力。	Our sole world champion in any sport is the chess grandmaster Vishwanathan Anand – in another non-Olympic sport, and one that calls for brain, not brawn.
逊尼派对伊朗的态度可能反映出对什叶派根深蒂固的怀疑（只要看看伊拉克多数逊尼派对什叶派统治的冷淡态度就不言自明了 ） 。	The Sunni reaction to Iran may reflect deep-seated suspicions about the Shia (witness the cold shoulder given by most Sunnis to Shia rule in Iraq).
赛后辛格提出“印度和巴基斯坦应当携手努力寻求合作方案，并需要实现永久性的和解以确保两国能有尊严地共存。	After the match, Singh said that “India and Pakistan should be working together to find cooperative solutions and need permanent reconciliation to live together in dignity and honor.
而挪威和瑞士等其他国家的经常账户余额已超过本国GDP的10 % ， 但这些国家却拒不对货币进行增值。	Other countries, like Norway and Switzerland, are running current-account surpluses that exceed 10% of their GDP, but are resisting currency revaluation.
美国流向墨西哥的人口比反过来更多；如果说美国有什么需要的话，也是更多的新来者以填补劳动力短缺，特别是看护行业。	More people move from the US to Mexico than the other way around; if anything, the US needs more newcomers to help make up for labor shortages, particularly in the care sector.
而在新计划启动期间，一位美国官员引用了哥本哈根共识的研究以表明营养强化是“对海地发展最有效的投资之一 ” 。	And during the launch of the new program, one US official cited Copenhagen Consensus research to show that fortification is “one of the most efficient investments in Haiti’s development.”
大部分水稀缺国家都管理着淡化水的使用，但决策者需要更新他们的投资策略、水管理政策和公共预算以充分整合水资源。	While most water-scarce countries regulate the use of desalinated water, decision-makers need to update their investment strategies, water-management policies, and public budgets to integrate the full range of water resources.
对于欧盟以南邻近地区的事件的政策、用语和反应必须与对于为了找工作而自愿从一个安全国家迁往另一个安全国家的事件有所区别。	The policies, language, and response to the events unfolding on the EU's southern border must be different from those concerning the voluntary movement of job seekers from one safe country to another.
印度29个邦中的四个（比哈尔、古吉拉特、曼尼普尔和那加兰）以及一个直辖区（拉克沙威或拉克代夫群岛）目前都在尝试强制性禁酒令。	Four out of 29 Indian states (Bihar, Gujarat, Manipur, and Nagaland) and one union territory (Lakshadweep or the Laccadive Islands) are currently attempting to enforce total prohibition.
用于发声是其中一个重要部分，因为人们不但聆听说了什么，还会注意到什么在没有受到挑战的情况下获得了通过。	Speaking up is an important part of that, because people not only listen to what is said, but also notice what passes without being challenged.
由于克里姆林宫行为暧昧 — — 如果不是故意采取欺骗政策的话 — — 显然法国不应该交付此前答应卖给俄罗斯的西北风级两栖攻击舰。	Given the Kremlin’s ambiguous behavior – if not its deliberate policy of deceit – it seems obvious that France should not deliver a Mistral-class assault warship, which it previously agreed to sell to Russia.
比如，沃尔玛雇用了两百万人，而美国劳工统计局预测，未来十年美国休闲和酒店业能够创造一百万个新增岗位。	Walmart, for example, employs two million people, and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that more than one million additional jobs will be created in America’s leisure and hospitality sector in the next decade.
对资本更高回报的渴求驱使投资者和投机者转向发展中国家，这类流入增加了杠杆，撑起了股价，并在某些情况下支撑了商品价格上涨。	The search for higher yields drove investors and speculators to developing countries, where the inflows increased leverage, propped up equity prices, and in some cases supported a commodity price boom.
如果无法实现这样的改变，美国就有可能不再参与JCPOA，这样的威胁纯属虚张声势，即使兑现了也必然会失败。	The threat to terminate US participation in the JCPOA if such changes are not made will thus prove either empty or self-defeating if carried out.
伊朗此前的一边倒式的胜利包括1997年的改革派哈塔米、2005年名不见经传的民粹主义煽动家内贾德，可能四年前的鲁哈尼也可以包括在其中，他们的优势也基本都是意料外的结果。	Previous landslide victories in Iran – those of the reformist Mohammad Khatami in 1997, of the little-known populist firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005, and, arguably, even of Rouhani four years ago – were also largely unexpected outcomes.
当然，很多怀疑论者提出只要采取低成本的合理预防措施，大规模网络崩溃的可能性非常之低，末日论者夸大了可能出现最坏情况。	True, many skeptics argue that with reasonable low-cost prophylactic measures, large scale cyber-meltdowns are highly implausible, and that doom-mongers overstate the worst-case scenarios.
我们希望为军方领导人开创一条出路，一条与人民的领导人和族群领导人展开真正的对话以及实现民族团结的路子。	We hoped to create a way out for the military leaders, a way to start a real dialogue with the people’s leaders and the leaders of ethnic groups, for the unity of the nation.
通过人民币升值来大幅度减少总体需求并非草率，是可以实现的，这是因为2007年的经常项目顺差是GDP的9.5 % 。	A sizeable reduction in aggregate demand through RMB appreciation is achievable without being imprudent, because the current-account surplus in 2007 was 9.5 % of GDP.
中国的政治制度内含的一个关键障碍在于：虽然人们普遍认为民主对于充满活力的公民社会是不可或缺的，但是当局已经下定决心不以任何方式，形态或形式去引入选举民主。	One key obstacle lies in the Chinese political system. It is widely believed that democracy is indispensable for a dynamic civil society.
中国方面则指出美国对华倾销生产太阳能电池板的关键材料多晶硅，并对美进口产品加征超过50%的报复性关税。	China, citing its own finding of US dumping of polysilicon – a key input in the production of solar panels – into its market, has already retaliated by imposing import tariffs that could exceed 50%.
但美国将会在一起针对特朗普政府近期对进口钢铁和铝征收关税的案件中败诉，因为它们极可能违反了WTO规则。	But the US stands to lose a case brought against the Trump administration’s recently imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, because they most likely violate WTO rules.
约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）最近指出，如果当年德国失业率没有高大30 % ， 希特勒就不会上台。	As Joseph Stiglitz recently pointed out, it is unlikely that Hitler would have come to power in Germany if the unemployment rate was not 30% at the time.
1991年冷战的结束开启了全球经济一体化的黄金时代，而世界最大两个经济体之间的新冷战必然会导致分裂和破碎。	If the end of the Cold War in 1991 launched the golden age of global economic integration, the beginning of the next cold war between the world’s two largest economies will undoubtedly produce division and fragmentation.
此外那些用来与现政权斗争的武器可能会在政权倒台后沦为派系交战的工具，这将使叙利亚的后续状况变得更加血腥。	In addition, arms provided to fight the regime will be used by factions to fight one another if and when the regime is removed, thereby making the aftermath in Syria that much more violent.
美国前总统小布什曾将伊朗称之为“邪恶轴心”的一分子，但他当年做出的入侵占领伊拉克决定却为什叶派同样占大多数的伊朗造了福。	President George W. Bush called Iran part of an “axis of evil,” yet his decision to invade and occupy Iraq benefited Shia-dominated Iran above all.
实际上，尽管阿拉伯之春结束了让穆斯林世界许多独裁统治者保持执政的腐败旧交易，扎尔达里及其助手似乎并没有收到消息。	Indeed, while the Arab Spring ended the old corrupt bargain that kept so many autocratic rulers in power across the Muslim world, Zardari and his associates appear not to have received the message.
这些选民一年前之所以选择他，不仅是因为他不是萨科齐，也是因为他是真左翼价值的化身，尽管他的中间道路温和立场并非吉兆。	These voters chose him a year ago not only because he was not Sarkozy, but because he incarnated the values of the true left, even if his centrist moderation seemed a bad omen.
我们的新报告《构建繁荣的初级医疗体系：哥斯达黎加的故事 》 （ Building a Thriving Primary Health-Care System: The Story of Costa Rica）揭示了它的成功奥秘。	The secret of its success is revealed in our new report, “Building a Thriving Primary Health-Care System: The Story of Costa Rica.”
但中央银行的成功也催生了过高的期望，这促使大多数政策制定者放手让货币部门去承担起宏观经济管理的主要责任。	But central banks’ successes fueled excessively high expectations, which encouraged most policymakers to leave their monetary counterparts largely responsible for macroeconomic management.
最近，安倍严重质疑此前已获立法通过的提高消费税措施的第二阶段，提高消费税一直被视为日本债务重组战略的关键。	In recent days, Abe has raised serious questions about proceeding with the second phase of a previously legislated consumer-tax hike that has long been viewed as the linchpin of Japan’s debt-consolidation strategy.
我们必须面对现实：人们如此渴望回归的宁静世界 — — 欧盟、联合国甚至是民族国家建立前的世界 — — 从来就没有存在过。	Let’s face it: the halcyon world to which many people are so eager to return – before, say, the European Union or the United Nations or even the nation-state – never really existed.
曾经带动十九世纪和二十世纪欧洲和北美城市经济增长的因素如今正在推动巴西，中国，印度，墨西哥，俄罗斯和其他新兴市场国家的城市化进程。	OXFORD – The forces that drove the growth of European and North American cities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are now driving urbanization in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and other emerging-market countries.
很多人上次读到国际货币基金的报道或许还是2011年5月时任总裁多米尼克·斯特劳斯卡恩被迫离职，当时有人指责他在纽约一家酒店对一名员工进行性侵犯。	The last time that many read a news story about the Fund may have been when then-Managing Director Dominique Strauss Kahn was forced out in May 2011, following accusations that he sexually assaulted an employee in a New York hotel.
这个词反映出人们已经日渐意识到，生命科学领域和生物制药领域的飞速进步有可能给人类带来巨大的福利，但使科学进步成为可能的那些知识、工具、技术也可能被滥用，造成故意伤害。	The term reflects a growing awareness that rapid developments in these fields offer the potential for great benefits, but that the knowledge, tools, and techniques that enable scientific advances also can be misused to cause deliberate harm.
工资保险的倡议者辩论说，培训如果由想让员工完成某一工作的雇主来进行，情况会好得多，因为雇主了解到底员工需要学习什么。	Far better, proponents of wage insurance argue, for the training to be carried out by an employer who wants a job done and knows what the employee needs to learn.
但当萨利赫决定将总统职位交由其子阿赫玛德（现任总统卫队队长）继承之后，他就开始逐步将阿赫玛尔边缘化。	But, as Saleh prepared the way for his son Ahmad – the head of the Presidential Guard – to succeed him, he began to marginalize al-Ahmar.
像班农这样的激进民族主义者竟然试图团结在一个全球运动之下，仿佛是跟自己所反对的那些国际主义敌人一个德行，这似乎有点讽刺。	It might seem ironic that radical nationalists, like Bannon, should be seeking to unite in a global movement, as though they were mimicking their internationalist enemies.
事实上，她在2008年民主党预选时就支持奥巴马，当时他还只是个相对无名的伊利诺伊州参议员。 卡洛琳使奥巴马的竞选赢得了仍忠于肯尼迪家族的民主党内人物中间的信誉。	Indeed, her backing for Obama in the Democratic Party primaries in 2008, when he was still a relatively unknown senator from Illinois, gave his campaign credibility among party insiders who remain loyal to her family’s legacy.
20世纪90年代出品了很多贬低女性的影片，片中的女性在“生物钟”的滴答声中绝望地等待，咒骂自己年轻时把事业放在第一位，而错过了找到合适伴侣结婚生子的机会。	The 1990’s produced a demeaning narrative of women waiting in frustration as their “biological clocks” ticked, cursing themselves for putting career first at the expense of finding Mr. Right and having children.
毕竟，历史上没有实际先例 — — 格陵兰脱离EEC很难作为可比的情况 — — 光是退欧细节谈判就可能消耗高达两年时间。	After all, there is no real precedent – Greenland’s departure from the EEC can hardly be considered a comparable situation – and negotiating the details of the withdrawal alone could take up to two years.
鉴于普京对人权、法治或民主关注甚少，坐视欧盟与美国领导人与埃尔多安在后政变镇压问题上硬碰硬无疑似乎是一个削弱北约的黄金机会。	Given that Putin cares little for human rights, the rule of law, or democracy, watching EU and US leaders butt heads with Erdoğan over his post-coup crackdown must have looked like a golden opportunity to weaken NATO.
但奥巴马政府继续否认中国是其战略核心，事实上，奥巴马政府不愿意说、也不愿意做任何可能引起中国反感的事情。	Yet the Obama administration continues to deny that China is at the center of its strategy. In fact, it is reluctant to say or do anything publicly that might raise China’s hackles.
总统奥巴马任命了“就业沙皇 ” ， 这也有助于提振信誉、加强可问责性以及强化克服当今重大且不断恶化的就业挑战所必须的协调。	President Barack Obama’s appointment of a “jobs czar” would also help to enhance the credibility, accountability, and coordination required to overcome today’s significant and rising employment challenges.
但不幸地是，尽管日本历史学家提供了极为详尽的（甚至是档案）证据，日本政府依然拒绝承认日本战时政权对这个恐怖计划应负的责任。	Unfortunately, the Japanese government, despite much circumstantial and even documentary evidence supplied by Japanese historians, now chooses to deny the wartime regime’s responsibility for this ghastly project.
气候变化、毒化，以及生物多样性和生态系统功能的丧失导致环境日益恶化，人们进行旨在减少不平等性或保护环境的治理改革的时间和能量也越来越少。	As environments deteriorate from climate change, toxification, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, people will have less time and energy for governance reform aimed at reducing inequality or preserving the environment.
2005年，我们兰德公司的同事预测，如果医疗卫生业可以复制其他行业曾发生过的IT驱动生产率的过程，美国每年可以节约800亿美元。	In 2005, colleagues of ours at the RAND Corporation projected that America could save more than $80 billion a year if health care could replicate the IT-driven productivity gains observed in other industries.
彻底反思进化论免不了要引起神创论者的注意，他们欢欣鼓舞地宣称，如果达尔文主义的专业支持者都不能形成一致，那么这个概念肯定在式微。	Radically rethinking evolutionary theory invariably attracts the attention of creationists, who gleefully announce that if professional advocates of Darwinism cannot agree, the concept must be in retreat.
而接受这一目标的不仅仅是富裕国家：从泰国到哥斯达黎加再到卢旺达，医疗五花八门而资源有限的国家正在投入资金和政治资本，以实现全民医疗覆盖。	And it is not only rich countries that have embraced this goal: from Thailand to Costa Rica to Rwanda, countries with mixed health systems and limited resources have dedicated funds and political capital to making universal health care a reality.
不论是用于抨击还是歌颂，极权主义一词都是指一种运动，这种运动自称有一套自洽的政治、经济和社会哲学，统摄了生活的一切方面。 法西斯主义者喜欢把自己想象成全知全能的。	In both the hostile and the celebratory use of the word, totalitarianism was intended to describe a movement that embraced all aspects of life in what purported to be a coherent philosophy of politics, economics, and society.
对微观金融业来说，这些系统代表了重要的机会，它们让借款人得以在手机上申请、获得和偿付贷款，使用本地代理网络存款和取款。	For the microfinance industry, such systems represent an important opportunity, as they enable borrowers to apply for, receive, and repay loans on their mobile phones, using a network of local agents to deposit and withdraw cash.
欧元区财政部长会议和国际货币基金组织（International Monetary Fund，简称IMF）已与希腊达成一致，应国际货币基金组织的要求为该国提供一定金额的债务减免，并发放103亿欧元（约合116亿美元）的救助资金。	Eurozone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund have agreed with Greece to begin, per the IMF’s demands, providing some debt relief to the country, and to release €10.3 billion ($11.6 billion) in bailout funds.
过去几年里，世界对于美国巨大的经常项目赤字和财政赤字，以及试图让中国允许人民币更为自由地针对美元浮动而忧心忡忡。	Much of the concern over the past few years has centered on America’s yawning current account and fiscal deficits, and its effort to get China to let the yuan float more freely against the dollar.
基于遗传的良好相貌并在社会生活中加以强化，可能已经在他们的声音模式中植入一个 通过电话可以投射的自信的语调。	A lifetime of social reinforcement based on their genetically given looks may have encoded into their voice patterns a tone of confidence that could be projected over the phone.
在智利，这项原则容许政府逐步偿还债务，并最终在将自身改造为净债权国的同时降低公共投资和产出的波动幅度。	In Chile, the rule allowed the government to pay back debt gradually and eventually turn itself into a net creditor, while at the same time reducing the volatility of public investment and output.
考虑到中东及北非地区难民危机的规模和持续时间，显然需要找到一种从临时向半永久性解决方案过渡的新方法。	Given the scale and duration of MENA’s refugee crisis, it is clear that a new approach is needed, one that shifts the focus from temporary to semi-permanent solutions.
但奥巴马无法独自完成这一点 — — 而如今，美国公众和美国国会似乎都没有依照道德指南针所知的方向前进。	But Obama cannot do it alone – and, so far, neither the American public nor the US Congress seems committed to reconnecting with its moral compass.
最后，亚洲的发展中经济体在1990年代末其实已经走投无路，只能接受异常严苛的IMF策略来作为接受援助的代价。	In the end, Asia’s developing economies had no choice but to accept draconian measures as the price of bailouts in the late 1990’s.
而在最悲观的情况下，土耳其经济将陷入崩溃，从而将包括叙利亚和目前滞留土耳其的他国难民在内的大量难民送入西欧。	In the worst-case scenario, Turkey’s economy will collapse, sending huge numbers of refugees – including Syrians and others currently in Turkey, as well as Turks themselves – to Western Europe.
托克维克拒绝反动的恋旧，认为我们注定会获得民主的胜利，同时又警告民主对自由构成危险。 他因此理所当然地闻名于世。	Tocqueville is justly famous for rejecting reactionary nostalgia and regarding democracy’s triumph as our destiny, while warning against the dangers that democracy holds for liberty.
但是，作为安卡拉政治游戏大师，埃尔多安将竭力掌控大局并坚持当前道路 — — 依靠国内政治极化甚至大胆地出击境外。	But, as the master of the political game in Ankara, he will try to shape the agenda, and remain on his current course, by relying on domestic polarization and, perhaps, daring foreign adventures.
前俄罗斯帝国的动荡同样愈演愈烈，俄罗斯进攻乌克兰，格鲁吉亚、摩尔多瓦和其他地方不断发生暴力活动都是1991年苏联解体带来的滞后反应。	The former Russian Empire is in growing turmoil as well, a kind of delayed reaction to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, with Russia attacking Ukraine and violence continuing to erupt in Georgia, Moldova, and elsewhere.
现代共和党守护神罗纳德·里根曾说与其说政府解决问题，还不如说是它问题的制造者，这样的宣言体现了从那以后成为共和党烙印的基本的反政府态度。	Ronald Reagan, the modern-day GOP’s patron saint, once said that government is the problem, not the solution, a dictum that embodied the anti-government animus that has defined the party ever since.
实际上，欧洲国家的宗教背景清楚地反映在有关这种研究的不同的欧洲国家的法律之中。 英国和瑞典最为开明，而意大利、奥地利和波兰最为限制。	Indeed, the religious background of Europe’s nations clearly manifested itself in various European laws on such research, with the United Kingdom and Sweden being the most liberal and Italy, Austria, and Poland the most restrictive.
中东、北朝鲜、苏丹达佛、中非和东非以及高加索地区，在所有这些地方美国都无法再只靠一己的力量获得成功。	The Middle East, North Korea, Darfur, Central and East Africa, the Caucasus – in none of these places can the US still act successfully on its own.
但他们还没有占据多数，而认为西方可能即将面临“阿拉伯化”或“伊斯兰化”危险的想法还远远没有成为主流。	But they are not yet in the majority, and the belief that the West is in imminent danger of being “Arabized” or “Islamized” is not quite yet mainstream.
目前有近200万人接受抗逆转录病毒治疗，因此年均艾滋病相关死亡人数在2005年后已经下降了约100,000人。	With almost two million patients now on antiretroviral treatment, annual AIDS-related deaths have fallen by around 100,000 since 2005.
“这没问题 ， ” 西方会这样对巴基斯坦人说 ， “ 但别看隔壁的阿富汗就是了，看到那你就知道我们是多么不可靠了 。 ”	You can count on us, the West would be saying, but don’t look next door to Afghanistan, where you will see that you can’t rely on us.
著名经济学家肯尼斯·阿罗（Kenneth Arrow）强调干中学（learning by doing）的重要性。	The great economist Kenneth Arrow emphasized the importance of learning by doing.
其中的好处是日本和印度对叙利亚和平进程的兴趣可以刺激中国在签署、而非阻碍解决方案的达成方面发挥积极的作用。	A bonus here is that Japanese and Indian interest in the Syrian peace process could spur China to play an active role in reaching, rather than blocking, a solution.
据称全球化意味着国家再也不能掌控自己的内部事务，而是必须与其它国家联合，结成像欧盟、东盟或南方共同市场那样的组织。	Globalization, it is said, means that nations can no longer control their own affairs.
此外，对于中国等快速发展的经济体，可再生能源部署完全没有取代化石燃料；相反，可再生能源构成了燃料供给约束，妨碍了更快的经济增长。	And, in the case of rapidly developing economies like China, renewable-energy deployment is not replacing fossil fuels at all; instead, renewables are supplementing a constrained fuel supply to facilitate faster economic growth.
塔鲁罗正确地没有将限制银行规模视为万灵丹 — — 他在演讲中清楚地指出，任何金融系统都会有各种潜在风险。	Tarullo rightly does not regard limiting bank size as a panacea – his speech made it clear that there are many potential risks to any financial system.
为了保证美国和泛美开发银行成员国实践他们对发展和人权的承诺，海地人民和美国的纳税人应该拥有一个将泛美开发银行贷款以及在海地的项目的状况向公众公开的制度。	The people of Haiti, as well as US taxpayers, deserve a system that makes public the status of IDB loans and projects in Haiti in order to ensure that the US and IDB member states uphold their commitments to development and human rights.
他的结论是“最佳资本比率是总资产的7％到8 ％ ， 相当于风险加权资产的12％到14 ％ （ 使用风险加权资产与欧元区及美国各大银行总资产的比率 ） ” 。	Cline’s conclusion is that “the optimal capital ratio is 7% to 8% of total assets, corresponding to 12% to 14% of risk-weighted assets (using the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets in euro area and US banks).”
你还可以想象一下如果没有这项发明增加的粮食产量，地球只能供养约50亿人口 — — 至少比今天的人口少20亿之多。	Or that without the added food made possible by their discovery, the earth could only support about 4 billion people – at least 2 billion less than today.
这样，周边地区注定难逃破坏性通货紧缩和衰退性调整的厄运，导致经济衰退、破产、拖欠和欧元退出的风险进一步加大。	Thus, the periphery is destined to a destructive deflationary and recessionary adjustment that will exacerbate the risks of recession, insolvency, eventual defaults and, possibly, exit from the euro.
现在的欧盟就像是十三州联邦宪法（Articles of Confederation）治下的美国。 十三州联邦宪法定义了1781年脱离英国独立至1787年宪法生效前的失败的美国治理结构。	The EU today operates something like the US under the Articles of Confederation, which defined the US’s ineffectual governing structure after independence from Britain in 1781 but prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1787.
印度的汽车数量比法国少四倍，道路相关死亡案例却要多20倍 — — 也就是说，平均每辆车造成的事故数高80倍。	India has four times fewer cars than France, though it suffers 20 times more road-related deaths – that is, 80 times more accidents per car.
但是，为了完成这一转变，中国领导人必须实施深刻而全面的结构性改革，逆转继续鼓励投资和出口、直接间接对消费课税的政策方向。	But, to accomplish this transition, China’s leaders must implement deep and comprehensive structural reforms that reverse a policy approach that continues to encourage investment and exports while explicitly and implicitly taxing consumption.
首先，全球经济的可贸易部门 — — 在该部门，经济活动和就业岗位的竞争是直接的 — — 占经济的总比重增加了；对于个体国家来说也是如此。	First, the tradable part of the global economy – where competition for economic activity and jobs is direct – is becoming a larger share of the whole; the same is true of individual economies.
巴塞罗那宣言十周年纪念为他们提供了一个重要机会来达成对统一立场的共识，即通过停止支持地中海地区的政治现状来支持当地的民主改革。	A key opportunity presents itself with the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration to define a common position to support democratic change in the Mediterranean by ceasing to back the political status quo there.
伊朗的专家们认为在考虑内部的不安定与外部制裁之间的平衡时，伊朗政府必须在国内安全与国际安全之间做出选择。	Iranian experts argue that, in considering the trade-off between internal unrest and external sanctions, the Iranian government must choose between domestic security and international security.
普京也与中国国家主席习近平建立了良好的工作关系，这一关系的基础是共同的国内不自由以及对制衡美国意识形态和影响的渴望。	And Putin has struck up a good working relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, based on their shared domestic illiberalism and desire to counter American ideology and influence.
太宽泛的定义会破坏一国的主权，太狭窄的定义 — — 比如主宰当今世界之物 — — 又会让暴力和动荡蔓延。	Just as too broad a definition could undermine a country’s sovereignty, too narrow a definition – like that which seems to predominate today – allows violence and instability to proliferate.
没有可行的办法监管一切政府行为，但我们确实希望 — — 为了我们自己，也为了告密者 — — 拥有诉诸法律的权利和在我们（或其他人）可能做错时说出来的权利。	There is no sensible way to regulate all government behavior, but we do want – for ourselves and for whistleblowers – the right to legal recourse and to speak out if we (or someone else) may have been wronged.
新德里—在印度卡他塔克邦，邦长支持印度人民党（BJP）组建邦政府，尽管反对联盟在邦立法机关赢得了更多席位。	NEW DELHI – In India’s Karnataka state, the governor is favoring the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form a government, despite an opposition coalition having won more seats in the state legislature.
讨论最多的方案是用市场力量让传统燃料变得更加昂贵；概念包括给碳定价和保护消除大气中二氧化碳的自然资源。	Among the most discussed remedies are those that would use market forces to make traditional fuels more expensive; ideas include putting a price on carbon and protecting natural resources that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
罗伯特·舒曼（Robert Schuman）在构思欧共体时承诺，一体化阻止了德国和法国之间再次爆发战争。	As Robert Schuman promised when he conceived the idea of a European Community, integration has prevented the recurrence of war between Germany and France.
生产率增长是必要的加速器，完成保持GDP总量增长所需的80%生产率增长和人均收入增长所需的22%生产率增长其相关任务非常艰巨。	The needed acceleration in productivity growth – by 80% to sustain overall GDP growth and by 22% to sustain per capita income growth at the rates of the last half-century – is daunting.
因此，逆转使用欧元的第一个十年中所出现的单位劳动成本巨大差异不仅要求在南欧实行��资限制和生产率强化改革，还要求北欧提高工资。	Reversing the large differential in unit labor costs that has emerged in the euro’s first decade thus requires not only wage restraint and productivity-enhancing reforms in the south, but also higher wage gains in the north.
美国成年人中每100人就有一人深陷囹圄 — — 这一人均比例为世界之最，比西欧或其他民主国家高5—10倍。	One out of every 100 American adults is incarcerated – the highest per capita rate in the world, 5-10 times higher than in Western Europe or other democracies.
不出一年，艾森豪威尔总统便批准了国家宇航局（NASA）拨款，并启动了NASA的第一个人类宇航项目水星计划（Project Mercury ） 。	In less than a year, President Dwight Eisenhower had approved funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and launched Project Mercury, NASA’s first human spaceflight program.
这一目标体现于欧盟最近所致力甚深的“财政契约”上，根据该契约，成员国对不可违背的赤字上限的承诺将写入宪法。	That goal is reflected in the European Union’s current focus on creating a “fiscal compact,” which would constitutionalize member states’ commitment to supposedly inviolable deficit ceilings.
事实上 ， “ 有指导的科技变迁 ” （ directed technological change）过程 — — 包括宏伟的目标、各个里程碑事件的确定以及实施时间表 — — 比许多人认为的要普遍得多。	In fact, the process of “directed technological change,” in which bold objectives are set, milestones are identified, and timelines are put into place, is much more common than many realize.
越来越多的巴勒斯坦人领教了仍被称为“和平进程”的东西的无能，他们认为法塔赫的死对头哈马斯 — — 统治加沙的伊斯兰运动 — — 更能打破当前僵局。	More and more Palestinians, fed up with the futility of what is still called the “peace process,” believe that Fatah’s fierce rival, Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules Gaza, has more effective ways to break the current impasse.
巨额的双边贸易赤字、对中国让货币保持在低水平的谴责、中国出口的产品一再发生质量低劣以及危险性的问题遭到了美国和欧洲的保护主义者的强烈抗议。	Huge bilateral trade deficits, accusations that China keeps its currency undervalued, and a rash of defective and dangerous Chinese-made exports have fueled a protectionist backlash in the United States and Europe.
因此，欧元区面临三大选择：重债国进行更多的紧缩、将全欧洲债务社会化，以及创造性的债务重组（这意味着投资者迟早会被迫接受损失 ） 。	Thus, the eurozone faces three choices: even more austerity for the heavily-indebted countries, socialization of the debt across Europe, or a creative re-profiling of debt, with investors forced to accept losses sooner or later.
显然，我们需要一个更加合作性的战略。 我们认为，基于专利保护和执行机制的跨境技术交换框架能够释放发达和发展中经济体的创造力。	Clearly, a more cooperative strategy is needed.We believe that a framework of cross-border technological exchange based on patent protection and enforcement mechanisms can release the creativity of developed and developing economies alike.
经济史学家贾雷德·鲁宾（Jared Rubin）的研究表明，只要某个城市在1500年之前拥有一座印刷厂，那么其在1530年前转变成为新教城市的可能性就大大增加。	Research by the economic historian Jared Rubin indicates that the mere presence of a printing press in a city before 1500 greatly increased the likelihood that the city would become Protestant by 1530.
这一领导角色可能让马克里能够重振萎靡中的南方共同市场。 南方共同市场包括多个拉美国家，能够支持通过增进贸易和投资减少贫困的国家计划。	Such leadership might enable Macri to rejuvenate the troubled Mercosur bloc, which includes several Latin American countries and could support national efforts to reduce poverty through increased trade and investment.
"但较贫穷的国家却承担着大量的""成本 "" - 每年由于环境退化损失高达8%的GDP，还要承受随之而来的对人类健康和福利的破坏性后果。"	"But the poorer countries pay much of the ""costs"" - losing up to 8% of their GDP per year due to environmental degradation, as well as suffering devastating effects on health and human welfare."
但这一水平的增长反映了前所未有 — — 也不可持续 — — 的国内投资增加，现已接近GDP的50 % 。	But growth at this level reflects an unprecedented – and unsustainable – rise in domestic investment to nearly 50% of GDP.
一个广泛的共识是智利必须改变其雇用和解雇法规，���许工会谈判换班制和工时，改善在职和脱产培训，为寻找工作者提供更多信息。	There is broad consensus that Chile must change hiring and firing rules, allow unions to negotiate shifts and working hours, improve on- and off-the-job training, and make more information available to job-seekers.
看来，抢救大保险公司AIG和禁止所有的卖空金融类股似乎还不够，现在美国财政部长保尔森建议购买（用纳税人的钱）金融界的不良资产。	As if rescuing the big insurer AIG and prohibiting all short selling of financial stocks was not enough, now US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposes buying up (with taxpayers’ money) the distressed assets of the financial sector.
今天，在邻国叙利亚兄弟们的激励下，伊拉克安巴尔省的逊尼民众正组建“部落军”与伊拉克政府军交战，没有任何领导人会对这样的挑战视若无睹。	Today, Sunnis in Iraq’s Anbar province, inspired by their brethren in neighboring Syria, are organizing “tribal armies” to do battle with the Iraq national army – a challenge to central authority that no leader could ignore.
美国政府代表明确宣称如果没有获得贸易伙伴的让步（包括更多的互惠政策 ） ， 就将对来自加拿大，欧盟和日本的进口产品加征新关税。	Without concessions from its trading partners, including more reciprocity, the US, its government representatives unequivocally declared, would implement new tariffs on imports from Canada, the European Union, and Japan.
尽管世贸组织禁止成员国以这种强制性技术转让作为市场准入条件，但中国回应说并没有强制，因为公司大可不在中国做生意。	And while the WTO prohibits member countries from conditioning market access on such mandatory technology transfers, the Chinese have responded that nothing is mandatory, because companies do not have to do business in China.
2013年 ， 《 外交事务 》 （ Foreign Affairs）刊登了一篇题为《印度的拙劣外交政策 》 （ India’s Feeble Foreign Policy）的文章，探讨了印度是如何阻碍自己崛起的，新德里政坛的乌烟瘴气让印度成了自己最大的敌人。	A 2013 essay in the journal Foreign Affairs, titled “India’s Feeble Foreign Policy,” focused on how the country is resisting its own rise, as if the political miasma in New Delhi had turned the country into its own worst enemy.
而国内宏观经济学家的看法却恰恰相反，他们认为美元即将贬值非但不是一次危机，还是一次加速成长的难得机会。	Domestically oriented macroeconomists, by contrast, see a forthcoming fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis, but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.
La Chine et l’Inde ne se limitent pas à des usines-champignons et à de la main d’œuvre à bas prix et peu qualifiée.	China and India represent more than mushrooming factories and low-cost semi-skilled labor.

当前实际增长低迷，甚至有可能放缓，而大多数国家的通胀则低于目标值，一些经济体甚至面临通货紧缩的风险。	Today, real growth is subdued and may even be slowing, while inflation is below target in most places, with some economies even facing the risk of deflation.
恰恰相反，实际油价在1929年之前几年波动不大，与1925到26年的“燃料危机”的高峰时期相比反而降低了近50 % 。	In contrast, real oil prices were flat leading up to 1929, and down nearly 50% in real terms from the 1925-6 “fuel folly” peaks.
考虑到许多北非政府的动荡 ， “ 打击蛇头 ” — —对许多欧盟人来说，这是首选方案 — — 需要许多年才会收到效果。	"“Cracking down on smugglers,"" the go-to solution for many in the EU, will take many years to have an impact, given the instability of many North African governments."
2002年将波罗的海国家纳入北约 — — 也是该组织首次侵入前苏联领土 — — 是一次灾难性的错误，导致俄罗斯人不可能在亲西方的同时保持爱国。	Expanding NATO into the Baltic States in 2002 – the Alliance’s first enlargement into former Soviet territory – was a catastrophic mistake, which made it almost impossible for a Russian to be both patriotic and pro-Western.
IMF以此表明对人民币继续崛起的信心，也增强了人民币迈向国际化的全球预期 — — 并给与了间接支持。	By demonstrating its confidence in the renminbi’s continued rise, the IMF has reinforced global expectations of – and lent implicit support to – the renminbi’s progress toward internationalization.
其清楚地展现了关于中国国家视野的一个重大变化 — — 从贫穷的发展中国家再到一个旨在成为强国的逐渐富裕社会。	It clearly signals a far-reaching change in national perspective – from that of a poor developing country to that of an increasingly prosperous society focused on becoming a Great Power.
在中国政府建岛作业的最高峰，奥巴马仍称 “削弱的、受威胁的中国比成功的、崛起的中国更令我们担心 。 ”	At the height of the Chinese government’s island-building, Obama argued that “we have more to fear from a weakened, threatened China than a successful, rising China.”
一些颇有价值的新风险管理计划包括对新疫苗的进一步承诺、对药品制造的补贴以使产品变得更加廉价，以及地区级灾难保险资金池。	Some worthwhile new risk-management proposals include advance commitments for new vaccines, subsidies to drug manufacturers to make their products more affordable, and regionally pooled catastrophe insurance.
经济管理应该委托给那些有能力胜任且独立的专家们 — — 即一群被授权以国家最高利益行事而无需顾及选举结果或公众意见的“柏拉图守护者 ” 。	Management of the economy should be entrusted to competent and independent experts, a group of “Platonic Guardians” empowered to act in the state’s higher interests, regardless of electoral outcomes or public opinion.
在默克尔权衡马克龙的方案的同时，她毫无疑问也要考虑德国的主要经济合作伙伴：高堡集团（Visegrád Group，V4 ） ， 即捷克、匈牙利、波兰和斯洛伐克。	While Merkel weighs Macron’s proposals, she is undoubtedly thinking of Germany’s primary economic partner: the Visegrád Group (V4), comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.
2017年，国际资金达到了11亿美元，但仍比实施消灭结核病全球计划（Global Plan to End TB）所需要的15亿美元相差不少。	While international funding reached $1.1 billion in 2017, this was recognized to be $1.5 billion short of what is needed to enact the Global Plan to End TB.
同样，不允许任何与俄国银行或企业有业务往来的银行进入美国金融系统可以在俄国制造出共产主义刚刚倒台时那样的经济混乱。	Similarly, denying any bank that does business with a Russian bank or company access to the US financial system would create the kind of economic chaos last seen in Russia immediately after the fall of Communism.
伊斯坦布尔 — — 接下来的几个月，加利福尼亚州库比蒂诺市苹果总部的12,000名员工将要完成向豪华新址的搬迁工作。	ISTANBUL – Over the next few months, the 12,000 employees based at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California will complete their move to an extravagant new campus.
经济学家们总会饶有兴趣地观察到那些针对别国保护主义行为的反制措施就如同是说 ： “ 如果你朝自己的脚开枪，我也会这样做 。 ”	Economists are fond of observing that the argument for counter-measures against protectionism abroad is like saying: “If you shoot yourself in the foot, I will do the same.”
布鲁塞尔 — — 任何人在思考当今欧洲军事力量在全球事务中的价值、关系和重要性时都需要时刻牢记两点：我们要向哪里发展？	BRUSSELS – Anyone reflecting on the value, weight, and relevance of today’s European military forces for global affairs needs to keep two crucial questions in mind: Where do we want to go?
首先，如果我们不缓解温室气体的排放，气候变化的负面影响将很难逆转，对人类和其他物种可能造成巨大的苦难，甚至危险。	First, if we do not mitigate emissions of GHGs, the negative effects of climate change will be difficult to reverse, implying great hardship and possibly danger to mankind and other species.
如果自然界运用可以预测的算法防止DNA复制过程中的基因突变，那么我们这个星球可能仍然处在高度优化的单细胞生物阶段。	If nature had used predictive algorithms that prevented random mutation in the replication of DNA, our planet would probably still be at the stage of a very optimized single-cell organism.
双方均敏锐认识到维持现状令他们付出高昂的成本，阻碍他们加入欧盟的努力并为两国经济都造成了不可持续的负担。	Both sides are acutely aware that the status quo implies a high cost, by hampering their EU accession bids and imposing an unsustainable burden on their respective economies.
在地球上，央行行长和债券投资者还是有一些共同点的：他们都担心目前波动里极低的情况不可持续或并非好事。	Here on Earth, central bankers and bond investors have something in common: both worry that the current period of extremely low volatility is neither sustainable nor desirable.
这样的自助也许受到 （ “ 社会市场经济”之父陆德维希·艾哈德在德国实施的）政策的鼓励，但是一些启动资金帮了大忙。	Such self-help can be encouraged by policies (which is what Ludwig Erhard, the father of the “social market economy” did in Germany), but some starting capital helps.
1985—2004年这二十年便是如此，而如下图所示，过去18个月的现货市场交易情况也与这一观点相符。	This is what happened for two decades from 1985 to 2004, and, as the chart below shows, trading in the spot market during the past 18 months has been consistent with this idea.
相反很多银行家走上了类似苏格兰英国皇家银行负责人弗雷德·古德温的道路，在古德温任职期间该银行积累了241亿英镑（合342亿美元）的亏损，但古德温自己却拿着巨额养老金退休。	Many bankers instead followed a path similar to Fred Goodwin, the head of Britain’s Royal Bank of Scotland, who racked up £24.1 billion ($34.2 billion) in losses, then resigned with a huge pension.
但如果你认为我们的领导人没有在憎恨上火上浇油，那你就想得太简单了，他们的“沙文主义”无非更加文明些罢了。	But it would be simplistic to believe that our leaders do not add fuel to the fire of hatred, even if their chauvinism takes a more “civilized” form.
这一动态暴露了特朗普经济学的阿克琉斯之踵：公然倒向保护主义，而保护主义与保持美国经济增长无法摆脱的外部储蓄和贸易赤字依赖格格不入。	That dynamic unmasks the Achilles’ heel of Trumponomics: a blatant protectionist bias that collides head-on with America’s inescapable reliance on foreign saving and trade deficits to sustain economic growth.
在此过程中，官员开始承认良好治理的重要性，最近将薄熙来撤职并进入调查程序便是中共“捍卫法治精神”的明证。	In the process, officials are acknowledging the importance of good governance, as demonstrated by recent efforts to justify the purge and investigation of Bo Xilai as an example of the Communist Party “safeguarding the rule of law.”
一个国家只需要“热衷于”开发“显而易见”的商业应用，并为满足新产品的需求创建便利条件，就可以实现经济增长。	A country needed only the “zeal” to develop “obvious” commercial applications, and build the facilities to meet demand for new products.
我们的讨论议题将集中在三个问题上：阿富汗安全责任的完全过渡、北约军力的持续开发以及北约的全球合作伙伴网络。	Our discussions will focus on three issues: the transition to full Afghan security responsibility, the continued development of Allied military capabilities, and NATO’s global network of partnerships.
If emissions were appropriately restricted, the value of emission rights would be a couple trillion dollars a year – no wonder that there is a squabble over who should get them.	If emissions were appropriately restricted, the value of emission rights would be a couple trillion dollars a year – no wonder that there is a squabble over who should get them.
今年，欧洲可能要继续应付伊斯兰叛军控制马里图谋的余波，而萨赫勒地区的长期发展后果要好几年才会显现出来。	Europeans are likely still to be dealing with the fallout of Islamist rebel groups’ attempted takeover of Mali this time next year, while the long-term consequences of developments in the Sahel are bound to be felt for years to come.
显而易见的解释是这样一个事实：和美国总统特朗普和整个欧洲的民粹主义领导人一样，内塔尼亚胡通过唤醒民众的基地部落本能积累政治资本。	The obvious explanation lies in the fact that, like US President Donald Trump and populist leaders throughout Europe, Netanyahu amasses political capital by appealing to the population’s base tribal instincts.
但根据夏姆斯大学工程学院学生会的说法 — — 全体成员在因为反对杀戮而集体退学 — — 阿提托是在学校参加期末考试时被捕的。	But according to the student union of the university’s engineering faculty – whose members collectively resigned in protest against the killing – Atito was arrested during a final exam on the university campus.
明年将是这条路径的一个里程碑：法国在2013年的目标是预算赤字控制在GDP的3%以下，2014年进一步降低债务/GDP比率，而2011年的比率是5.2 % ， 2012年是4.5 % 。	The coming year will be a milestone on this path: France is targeting a 3%-of-GDP budget deficit in 2013, down from 5.2% in 2011 and 4.5% in 2012, and a lower debt/GDP ratio from 2014 onward.
限制税收支出可以削减相当于2%GDP的年度赤字，从而在2021年将债务-GDP比率拉低25个百分点以上。	Limiting tax expenditures could reduce the annual deficit by as much as 2% of GDP, thereby reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021 by more than 25 percentage points.
决策者应该着眼于肯尼亚模式，采取轻而有效的监管，这种方式促进了M-Pesa等点对点支付系统的快速成长。	Policymakers should look to Kenya’s model of light but effective regulation, which has fostered the rapid growth of the peer-to-peer payment system M-Pesa.
举一个众所周知的例子，如果你欠银行1000美元，那么你要看银行脸色；但如果你欠银行10亿美元，你就拥有了凌驾于银行之上的强大的讨价还价能力。	To take a well-known example, if you owe a bank $1,000, the bank has power over you; but if you owe the bank $1 billion, you may have considerable bargaining power over the bank.
主权债务水平高企，加上金融部门中某些部分的不当行为，放大了欧元区危机，也造成了重要的信心问题，如今需要系统性方案才能解决。	High levels of sovereign debt, together with the behavior of parts of the financial sector, have amplified the crisis in the eurozone and raised important issues of confidence that now require a systemic answer.
同一个月，多达两百万支持独立的加泰罗尼亚人在巴塞罗那举行了游行，也许是欧洲有史以来规模最大的游行示威。	The same month, up to two million pro-independence Catalans marched through Barcelona, in what may have been the largest demonstration ever seen in Europe.
随着演出落幕，掌声渐息，也是时候好好查看一下奥巴马此行的“资产负债表 ” ， 看看这位总统究竟得到了什么，又丢掉了什么。	Now that the play is over and the applause has died down, it is time to check the balance sheet and see how much Obama achieved and how much he conceded.
如果本已不稳定的局势在美国为首的战斗行动终止后发生恶化，那么印伊两国就必须重拾在1990年代的战略合作。	If the already-unstable situation there deteriorates after the end of US-led combat operations, India and Iran may be compelled to revive their strategic cooperation of the 1990’s.
对于他们而言，说“俄国回来了”意味着令人羞辱的叶利钦年代已经结束，而且他们必须特别是与美国平起平坐。	For them, to say “Russia is back” means that the humiliating Yeltsin years are over, and that they now must be treated as equals, particularly by the United States.
有用的储备货币的供应应该是有限的，但同时必须具有充分的弹性以满足动荡的金融世界所产生的大规模不可预期的需求。	A useful reserve currency must be limited in supply, but have sufficient elasticity to satisfy the large, unpredictable needs that may arise in a turbulent financial world.
除了生态风险，批评者还警告说，SRM一旦被部署，可能成为强大的武器，让国家、公司或个人有能力操纵气候赢得战略利益（这样的概念，连好莱坞也无法拒绝 ） 。	Beyond the ecological risks, critics warn that, once deployed globally, SRM could spawn powerful weapons, giving states, corporations, or individuals the ability to manipulate climate for strategic gain (an idea that not even Hollywood can resist).
该地区森林覆盖率已经下降70 % ， 而且山体侵蚀带来的沉积物已经堵塞了城市水库，从而对巴西最大城市的供水安全构成威胁。	The area has lost 70% of its original forest cover, and sediment from eroding hillsides has clogged the city’s reservoir, jeopardizing the water supply of Brazil’s largest city.
例如G20集团就发起了相互评估进程项目（Mutual Assessment Process ） ， 设立一个得到各成员国同意的指标，并在此基础上进行互相评估。	For example, the G20 launched the Mutual Assessment Process, whereby member countries are evaluated on the basis of agreed indicators.
但政府对飓风卡特里娜的处理却被很多人称作“国家的耻辱 ” ， 在这样的情况下，质问我们的国家领袖恰恰是民主自身提出的要求。	But asking hard questions of our nation’s leaders is exactly what democracy demands when the government’s response to Hurricane Katrina is widely viewed as “a national disgrace.”
1994年1月1日墨西哥、加拿大和美国达成北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）时，墨西哥似乎正面临着真正的腾飞。	When the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Mexico, Canada, and the United States entered into force on January 1, 1994, it seemed that Mexico was poised for a true takeoff.
俄罗斯同样如此，尽管不乏鼓舞人心的言论（如建立在创新基础上的发展 ） ， 但随着贪腐弊病被允许向着各处蔓延、加上该国愈加依赖于自然资源这一财富，如今的俄罗斯经济之现代化程度正在继续下降。	So is Russia, where, despite encouraging talk about innovation-based development, the economy continues to de-modernize as corruption has been allowed to metastasize, and as the country relies increasingly on its natural-resource wealth.
在这种情况下，巴基斯坦的将军们不仅不能继续资助阿富汗普什图族激进团体（比如塔利班及其盟友哈卡尼网络 ） ， 反而可能被迫抵御严重威胁巴基斯坦团结的因素。	In this scenario, Pakistani generals, instead of continuing to sponsor Afghan Pashtun militant groups (like the Taliban and their allies like the Haqqani network), would be compelled to fend off a potentially grave threat to Pakistan’s unity.
当然，中国的增长几乎肯定要比官方数字所揭示的波动更大，这部分是因为地方政府有动机将它们上报给中央当局的数据做平滑处理。	Of course, Chinese growth almost surely fluctuates far more than the official numbers reveal, in part because local officials have incentives to smooth the data that they report to the central authorities.
二十年前，成立一个亚洲联盟的主要障碍之一是日本这个亚洲最先进同时也是最成功，但是对亚洲并没有认同感的��家。	Twenty years ago, one of the main obstacles to creating an Asian Union was Japan – Asia’s most advanced and successful country, but one that did not feel Asian.
然而以股东价值为名实施的经营活动通常只有利于那些自身财富与公司利润关系密切的人，而且很可能实际上会损害许多股东的利益。	But actions taken in the name of shareholder value often benefit only those whose wealth is closely tied to the company’s profits, and may actually be harmful to many shareholders.
在这个领导人喜欢高谈阔论的大洲，20世纪90年代领导智利从独裁走向民主的埃尔文（Patricio Aylwin）是一个异类：他是一位轻声细语的教授，热爱研究更加艰深的行政法。	In a continent of loud-mouthed leaders, Patricio Aylwin, who led Chile from dictatorship to democracy in 1990, was an oddity: a soft-spoken professor whose great love was the study of the more abstruse aspects of administrative law.
他在去年 7 月被捕后用自己的手机在推特上发送了紧急求助信号，他的案子很快吸引了国内国际的关注，而这也帮助他在被捕两个多星期后获释。	He tweeted an SOS via his mobile phone after he was arrested last July, and his case quickly attracted both domestic and international attention, which helped secure his release a little over two weeks later.
俄罗斯以依法为由拒绝交出斯诺登让普京再次与奥巴马争锋相对 — — 这一回，作为合法性和人权捍卫者的是俄罗斯。	And Russia’s refusal to hand over Snowden, under the pretext of strict adherence to the law, has allowed Putin to poke Obama in the eye once again – this time while posing as a defender of legality and human rights.
而去年10月习近平主席在第十九次党代会上的讲话中则转而从意识形态的角度来提出同样的观点，用所谓马克思的主要矛盾原理重新阐述了“不平衡不充分”的发展所产生的陷阱。	Last October, in a speech to the 19th Party Congress, President Xi Jinping made the same point from an ideological perspective, reframing the so-called Marxian principal contradiction around the pitfalls of “unbalanced and inadequate” development.
2013年11月，克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）写道 ， “ 德国没能调整放大了紧缩成本 。 ”	In November 2013, Paul Krugman wrote that, “Germany’s failure to adjust magnified the cost of austerity.”
有时候是激进的巴勒斯坦人对以色列的平民进行恐怖主义攻击，籍以挑起以色列的过激暴力性反应，从而打破双方温和派之间建立信任的进程。	Sometimes this involves a terrorist attack by radical Palestinians against Israeli civilians, in the hope of provoking an exaggerated violent response from Israel that breaks the process of trust building among moderates on both sides.
除非民主世界明白现在决非相信外交妥协的时候、必须以足够强硬的立场阻止普京的帝国图谋，否则事件可能朝不可收拾的方向发展。	Unless the democratic world understands that now is not the time for faith in diplomatic compromise, and that it must respond strongly enough to stop Putin’s imperial designs, events could follow a logic that is too dreadful to contemplate.
在去年的论坛上，一个由十位俄罗斯著名自由派政治分析家组成的分论坛 — — 这是盖达尔论坛的固定特色，我也是其中之一 — — 怀疑一些挑衅性内容呼之欲出。	At last year’s Forum, a ten-person panel of prominent Russian liberal political analysts – a regular feature of the Forum, in which I participate – suspected that some defiance was on its way.
选民得到的承诺是与（英国最大的市场）欧洲签订有利的贸易协议、降低移民人数，并节约资金用于国家卫生体系和其他稀缺的公共产品及服务。	Voters were promised an advantageous trade deal with Europe (Britain’s biggest market), lower immigration, and more money for the National Health Service and other cherished public goods and services.
中国在斯里兰卡一帆风顺，直到2015年拉贾帕克萨出人意料地在选举中败给了西里塞纳，后者的竞选承诺是让斯里兰卡摆脱中国债务陷阱。	It was smooth sailing for China, until Rajapaksa was unexpectedly defeated in the early 2015 election by Maithripala Sirisena, who had campaigned on the promise to extricate Sri Lanka from the Chinese debt trap.
比如，我们需要加强对零售金融产品消费者的保护，对新债券实行更为严格的披露机制，并且设计出更好的避险工具。	For example, we need stronger consumer protection for retail financial products, stricter disclosure requirements for new securities, and better-designed vehicles for hedging risks.
麦肯锡国际研究院的模拟研究表明，未来五年这些成本将占到潜在总收益的80 % ， 而到2030年却将下降至潜在总收益的1/3左右。	MGI’s simulation suggests that these costs will amount to 80% of gross potential gains in five years, but will decline to one-third of those gains by 2030.
贝鲁特—三年前，区域民意调查显示中东地区最受人们爱戴的领导是真主党领袖哈桑·纳斯鲁拉，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德以及伊朗总统马哈茂德·艾哈迈迪－内贾德。	BEIRUT –Three years ago, regional opinion polls showed that the Middle East’s most popular leaders were Hezbollah leader Sayed Hassan Nasrallah, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
因此他们必须与新的实际执政者保持接触，帮助新政府尤其在经济领域做出必要的改革，以满足普通民众的经济发展要求。	So it should engage with the new de facto power and help the new government make the changes necessary, especially with respect to the economy, so that it can deliver adequate performance for Egypt’s citizens.
美国与比利时进行八分之一决赛的那个星期二下午，科罗拉多州阿斯彭（Aspen）的每一间酒吧都坐满了人。	On the Tuesday afternoon when the US played Belgium in the knockout round, every bar in Aspen, Colorado, was packed.
而奥巴马医改所采用的方案是当年由美国传统基金会这类保守智库所提议，并由时任州长的共和党人米特·罗姆尼在马萨诸塞州推广应用。	The approach taken by Obamacare was proposed in conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and enacted in Massachusetts by Republican Governor Mitt Romney.
其他人选还有利比亚前驻法大使奥马尔·布里贝什（Omar Brebesh ） ， 不过此君后来被证实死亡，而且显然是被一位带头推翻卡扎菲的民兵头目折磨致死的。	Others, such as Libya’s former ambassador to France, Omar Brebesh, were found dead, apparently tortured by a militia that spearheaded the campaign to overthrow Qaddafi.
当泡沫体现在股价上时，衰退五年后经济的表现平均低于标准值4 % 。 当泡沫体现在房产市场时，这个数值将会达到9 % 。	When the bubble is in equity prices, the economy performs 4% below par, on average, after five years – and as much as 9% below par when the bubble is in the housing market.
早在2012年他就曾发推批评世界银行“把贫困跟‘气候变化’硬扯在一起 ” ， 还抱怨说“真不知道为啥这些国际组织都那么低效 。 ”	Back in 2012, he tweeted criticism of the World Bank for “tying poverty to ‘climate change’” (his quotation marks). “And we wonder why international organizations are ineffective,” he complained.
但正如中国单方面肆无忌惮地在亚洲主张陆上和海上领土权利，它也在利用改变跨境界河流向和拒绝传输水文数据来深化其地区力量。	But just as China has unilaterally and aggressively asserted its territorial and maritime claims in Asia, it is using the reengineering of cross-border riparian flows and denial of hydrological data to deepen its regional power.
即便欧尔班的匈牙利拒绝履行欧盟成员国义务，该国仍从欧洲每年收到超过55亿欧元（合64亿美元）的巨资，而仅为共同预算贡献不到10亿欧元。	Even as Orbán’s Hungary rejects the obligations of EU membership, it receives more than €5.5 billion ($6.4 billion) from the EU each year, while contributing less than €1 billion to the common budget.
否则，勒庞将有望取得胜利，朝着20世纪30年代又进一步 — — 许多国家抛弃国际合作和集体解决共同问题的做法。	The alternative could be a Le Pen victory, and a further step back toward the 1930s, when too many countries turned their back on international cooperation and collective solutions to shared problems.
为保护那些产生令莫迪如此觊觎的所有数据财富的民众，莫迪必须兑现其“实现政府最小化、执政能力最大化”的竞选承诺。	To protect the people who are generating all of that data wealth that Modi so covets, he must follow through on his campaign promise to deliver “minimum government, maximum governance.”
幻灭的非国大党党员可能成为拉马福萨改革计划的强力盟友；他们足够强大，能让他击败祖玛所偏向的候选人、他的前妻、非盟委员会前主席德拉米尼-祖玛（Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma）成为党领导人。	Disillusioned ANC members can be strong allies for Ramaphosa’s reform attempts; they were powerful enough to elect him over Zuma’s preferred candidate, his ex-wife and former African Union Commission chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
"当共产主义崩溃后，他又将改革进程中的一切弊病归咎于""外国人 "" - 即西方、罗马尼亚的匈牙利少数民族，特别是犹太人。"	"When communism collapsed, he blamed every shortcoming in the reform process on ""foreigners"" - meaning the West, Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority, and especially the Jews."
尽管主要的外国美元持有者例如中国突然间大范围抛售美元看起来不大可能，但是，某一类似于1914年第一次世界大战爆发那样的灾难性事件有可能促使人们寻求一种新的国际交易媒介。	While a broad and abrupt sell-off by major foreign holders of dollars – for example, China – appears unlikely, a cataclysmic event, similar to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange.
事实上，越南的“水下”情况，与荷兰的大部分地区如出一辙：在那里，包括世界上最繁忙的机场之一史基浦机场在内的大片土地，在涨潮时都在位于海平面以下。	In fact, it is “underwater” in the same way that much of Holland is: there, large areas of land, including Schiphol, one of the world’s busiest airports, are below sea level at high tide.
如果得到专业的管理，这笔巨大的商业资产组合的收益不但能为急需的基础设施投资提供资金，也能为其他一切有需求的公共品和服务提供资金。	If professionally managed, the yield from such a vast portfolio of commercial assets could fund not just critically needed infrastructure investments, but also any other public goods and services that are in demand.
令人担心的地方是政策可能无法改变过度依赖中央银行的局面，最终当我们回顾新常态的时候发现，尽管它存在诸多局限并且令人沮丧，但仍是一段相对平静和幸福的时期。	The fear is that policies will fail to pivot away from excessive reliance on central banks, and end up looking back to the new normal, with all of its limitations and frustrations, as a period of relative calm and wellbeing.
但是如果他们那时候知道希特勒德国会得到核弹，他们或许就会批准弗兰克林·罗斯福的决定，在纳粹之前开发核弹。	But if they knew that Hitler’s Germany would get it, they might have approved Franklin Roosevelt’s decision to develop it before the Nazis.
在本例中，相互依赖创造了一种“金融恐怖平衡 ” ， 可以类比冷战期间的美国和苏联，两国当时从未运用自身的核实力在核战争中摧毁对方。	In this case, interdependence has created a “balance of financial terror” analogous to the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union never used their potential to destroy each other in a nuclear exchange.
戴高乐建立独立的权力中心的梦想从来没有实现，但是“尴尬的夥伴”的作用给了法国外交以独特的味道，而且，这对于受到挫败、趾高气扬但是不再霸权的俄国可能同样适用。	The Gaullist dream of creating an independent power center never succeeded, but the role of “awkward partner” has given a distinctive flavor to French diplomacy, and it may be equally viable for a shrunken, proud, but no longer hegemonic Russia.
一美元银行贷款可以增加一美元货币供给，因此，银行并非金融中介（intermediary ） ； 而是货币创造者。	Given that a dollar in new bank loans increases the money supply by a dollar, banks are not financial intermediaries; they are money creators.
除了现代战争所带来的创伤，贫穷和愤怒的俄罗斯士兵对平民进行了大肆蹂躏，他们偷窃平民留下的财物，他们强奸妇女。	Besides the general devastation that modern warfare brings, impoverished and angry Russian soldiers were wreaking havoc on civilians by stealing belongings left behind and raping women.
欧洲仍然是重要的经济和商业行动者 — — 可能在任何时候重获生机，因为它至少已经部分走出了系统性危机。	Europe remains a significant economic and commercial actor – one that can rebound at any time, now that it has at least partly transcended its systemic crisis.
在这方面我亲眼目睹了英国前首相玛格丽特·撒切尔夫人的经历。 她亲自阅读政策简报并对大部分事务了如指掌。	I personally witnessed this with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who read her policy briefs and knew most of the issues inside out.
对于俄罗斯这个刚刚失落了世界帝国地位，并在后共产主义过渡初期遭受严重经济收缩的国家，他发誓要让这个国度重新赢得尊严。	He pledged to restore a sense of dignity to a country that had just lost its empire and suffered a severe economic contraction during the early years of the post-communist transition.
相反，2011—2012年间，许多具系统重要性的欧洲银行都有风险暴露，这就提高了可能威胁到整个欧元区的多米诺效应的风险。	In 2010-2012, by contrast, systemically important European banks were exposed, raising the risk of a domino effect that threatened the entire eurozone.
纽黑文—金融市场和所谓的达沃斯共识达成了广泛的一致，类似于经典的周期性复苏的东西终于要在美国出现了。	NEW HAVEN – Financial markets and the so-called Davos consensus are in broad agreement that something close to a classic cyclical revival may finally be at hand for the US.
而且允许他们继续控制走私路线引发了省级官员和阿富汗国家警察资金腐败的连锁反应，这回过头来又滋长了叛乱。	And allowing them to continue to control the smuggling routes creates a ripple effect that bankrolls corruption of provincial officials and the Afghan National Police, which in turn feeds the insurgency.
但它的旁边则出现了一股新的力量：金色黎明党（Golden Dawn ） — —这个新纳粹政党正在街头和公共生活中宣扬暴力，而它得到的公众支持竟因此不断上升。	But a new force has emerged on its flank: Golden Dawn, a frankly neo-Nazi party that is spreading violence on the streets and in public life, and seeing its popular support increase as a result.
曼彻斯特 — — 虽然自从18岁离开高中去上大学后我并未永久定居在那里，但我依然为我是曼彻斯特人而感到自豪。	MANCHESTER – I am a proud Mancunian (as the people of Manchester are known), despite the fact I haven’t lived here permanently since I left school for university when I was 18.
在他1776年出版的《国富论》一书中，亚当·斯密为自由贸易 — — 而不是被关税所扭曲的贸易 — — 提供了一个雄辩而有说服力的论据。	In his 1776 book The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith provided an eloquent and convincing argument for free trade, instead of trade distorted by tariffs.
从亚历山大大帝时代到斯大林的冷血时代，统治者以各种形式实施此类策略，使人民臣服于他从而达到其个人意愿。	From Alexander the Great to Stalin the Cruel, variants of that strategy have been used to keep nations in thrall to the will of an emperor.
业务模式的萧条和对第三方数字散播者 — — 如脸谱和谷歌 — — 的日益依赖，严重制约了新闻组织，也吞噬了它们的利润。	The erosion of business models and growing dependence on third-party digital distributors – like Facebook and Google – have handcuffed news organizations and cut deeply into their profits.
其结果是种族划分开始被接受成为一种积极的因素。 这不仅表现在大学录取过程中，也被贯彻到了公共采购决策、对小型企业的信贷和政府雇用等方面。	As a result, ethnicity began to be weighed as a positive factor not only in university admissions, but also in public procurement decisions, credit facilities for small enterprises, and government hiring.
此外还需要解决严重的过度负债问题 — — 没完没了的希腊危机突出了这一点 — — 该问题的破坏性影响远远不局限于直接受害者。	There is also a need, highlighted by the protracted Greek crisis, to address pockets of severe over-indebtedness, which can have crushing impact extending well beyond the directly affected.
结果，食品行业在道貌岸然的科学家和政客的协助和教唆下，让人类陷入了慢性新陈代谢病的折磨，让全球医保陷入了破产危险。	As a result, the food industry, aided and abetted by ostensibly well-meaning scientists and politicians, has afflicted humankind with the plague of chronic metabolic disease, which threatens to bankrupt health care worldwide.
2013年的1 500亿美元额外收入将相当于GDP的1 % ， 美国经济还吞不下如此巨额的数量，特别是如果还要加上政府支出削减和工资税增加的话。	Extra revenue of $150 billion in 2013 would be 1% of GDP, and could be too much for the economy to swallow, particularly if combined with reductions in government spending and a rise in the payroll tax.
如果发生暴力镇压事件，西方与伊朗的核问题谈判会遭遇更大的困难，因为与外界的隔离和对抗将成为伊朗政权赖以生存的基础。	In the case of violent suppression, the West will find it a lot harder to hold talks with Iran over its nuclear program, because the regime will be able to rely for its survival solely on isolation and confrontation with the outside world.
第二个不同点在于，尽管最近以来社会保障项目有所削减，但失业者所获得的公共支持仍比20世纪30年代多得多。	A second difference is that, notwithstanding recent cuts in social programs, the unemployed receive more extensive public support than in the 1930’s.
除了更严格的预算规则以及银行业联盟的启动外还投入了一系列新举措来强化欧洲稳定机制，而该机制目前则作为单一清算基金（Single Resolution Fund）的保障。	In addition to tighter budgetary rules and the start of a banking union, new efforts are underway to strengthen the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is now meant to serve as a backstop for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF).
但这绝不意味着它独一无二，当然唯一例外的是它的规模（尽管土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安曾试图在安卡拉修建规模能与之相媲美的新建筑 ） 。	But it is by no means unique, except in its size (though Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has tried to rival it in scale with his new palace in Ankara).
事实上，军队天然地不具有灵活性，冷战已经过去了 20 年，军队也只是缓慢地在适应自己不断发展的角色而已。	Indeed, flexibility does not come naturally to armed forces, with the result that the two decades since the end of the Cold War have seen only slow adaptation to the military’s evolving roles.
作为二战的功勋老兵，史蒂文斯法官很可能认为自己至少和布什政府司法部的官员们一样有资格预测高院裁决对美国军事效力的影响。	A decorated World War II veteran, Justice Stevens may well have thought that he was at least as qualified as the civilians in the Bush Justice Department to forecast the impact of the court's ruling on military efficiency.
香港从未成为民主实体，但它确实拥有自由言论，相对诚实的政府和独立司法 — — 所有这些都受到伦敦民主政府的支持。	Hong Kong was never a democracy, but it did have a relatively free press, a relatively honest government, and an independent judiciary – all backed by a democratic government in London.
桑德斯阵营提出的核心方案是将华尔街大银行分解成小机构，从而确保任何银行都不会过于庞大以至于其倒闭会危及金融体系的其他部分。	At the center of Sanders’s campaign is a proposal to break up the big Wall Street banks into little pieces, thereby ensuring that no bank is so big that its failure would endanger the rest of the financial system.
改革者们相信这样的改革是唯一能使沙特阿拉伯在暴力威胁、不稳定性和国家分裂等这些已经初露端倪的危机中得以生存的办法。	The reformers believe that such reforms are the only way for Saudi Arabia to survive the threat of violence, instability, and national fragmentation that is looming on its horizon.
但即便是他们都采取了一些改革措施¾虽然力度尚嫌不够，而且改革措施刚刚实行还看不出有任何变化，但归根结底，他们已经开始行动了。	But even they have carried out some reforms – not enough and too recently to make a difference yet; nonetheless, they have started to move.
在OMT计划下，欧洲央行可以通过直接购买将西班牙提升至与英国等非欧元区国家相同的水平，从而代替从主权债券市场逃离的外国资本。	Under the OMT program, the ECB can replace foreign outflows from sovereign-bond markets through direct purchases, putting Spain on par with non-eurozone countries like the United Kingdom.
自由之家组织的评分非常接近：31个非阿拉伯穆斯林国家中，有12个连续3年以上得分较高，其中8个连续5年以上获得了高分。	The Freedom House scores are remarkably similar: 12 of 31 non-Arab Muslim countries had relatively high scores for at least three consecutive years, and eight for five consecutive years.
在8月份的怀俄明州杰克森霍尔（Jackson Hole）央行行长年会上，普林斯顿大学的克里斯托弗·西姆斯（Christopher Sims）清晰地解释了这一轮。	In August, at the annual conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Princeton’s Christopher Sims provided a lucid explanation of the theory.
此人与共产主义时代毫无瓜葛，他把所有前共产党员都从重要位置上赶下了台，甚至禁止前总理莱舍克·米莱尔参与议会选举。	He has nothing to do with the communist era and has sacked all former Party members from important positions, even barring former Prime Minister Leszek Miller from standing for parliament.
我们制定的该宣言把平等视为一种“独立的权利 ” ， 也就是说，它最为一种独立存在的权利，它并不依赖于对某一种法定权利，如受教育权，的侵犯。	The declaration that we have developed regards equality as a “freestanding right.” In other words, it exists as a separate right, and is not dependent on the violation of some other legal right, such as the right to education.
光是在过去五年，就有数万人丧生，近四分之一人口流离失所，其中许多人只能逃往邻近的肯尼亚、乌干达和苏丹。	In the last five years alone, tens of thousands have died, and nearly a quarter of the population has been displaced, with many having little choice but to flee to neighboring Kenya, Uganda, or Sudan.
他们可以发挥实质性的领导作用，联合缅甸各政党、中国、印度、欧盟、俄罗斯和美国为缅甸的变革制定一份路线图。	They could play an essential leading role in a process including the Burmese parties, China, India, the European Union, Russia, and the United States that could devise a roadmap for change in Burma.
因为其成员国涵盖了大多数温室气体排放大国；各成员国在组织内部形成的共识将大大有助于12月的哥本哈根世界气候变化会议取得成功。	Its members represent the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emissions; agreement among them at Pittsburgh would go a long way towards ensuring that December’s international Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen does not end in hot air.
由于奥巴马要满足那些期望，其它国家要最好作准备来自美国提出的要求-甚至是压力，即它们要与美国行动一致而不是背道而驰或袖手旁观。	And since Obama will want to meet some of those expectations, other countries had better be prepared for American requests – and pressure – that they act with the US rather than act against it or sit on their hands.
杜克大学《首席财务官》杂志全球商业展望调查（Duke University CFO Magazine Global Business Outlook Survey）发现，近60%的美国首席财务官认为公共信任缺失已经危害到商业环境。	The Duke University CFO Magazine Global Business Outlook Survey found that nearly 60% of chief financial officers in the United States believe that a lack of public trust has harmed the business environment.
显然，参与资本外逃的艺术投资者，或者希望隐身或洗钱的艺术品投资者，他们的激励和动机与普通投资者大相径庭。	Clearly, the incentives and motives of art investors who are engaged in capital flight, or who want to hide or launder their money, are quite different from those of ordinary investors.
这削弱了欧洲邻国政策的政治重要性，该政策是2004年制定的，用以避免扩大的欧盟与其邻国因新的分界线而出现紧急事件。	This weakens the political importance of the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP), an initiative developed in 2004 to avoid the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbors.
事实上，大部分国家要么追求固定汇率，要么追求汇率目标，要么采取管理浮动，顾名思义，这些做法都包含买卖外汇以缓和或消除汇率波动。	Indeed, a majority of countries pursue either fixed exchange rates, exchange-rate targets, or managed floating, all of which by definition entail buying and selling foreign exchange to moderate or eliminate exchange-rate fluctuations.
国务卿莱斯最近访问中东各国首都，向埃及、约旦、沙特以及海湾国家传话说，美国一旦失败并且匆忙撤兵肯定将会破坏它们国家的稳定。	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s recent tour of Middle East capitals helped spread the word to Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states that any US failure and sudden withdrawal would be certain to destabilize them.
其次，在考虑协调的领域，它们可以倾向于原始标准中较不苛刻的一个，除非有充分的证据表明这样做不利于相关监管目标。	Second, where they do consider harmonization, they could favor the less stringent of the original standards, unless there is credible evidence that it would not support the relevant regulatory objective.
换句话说，你可以选择带着些许痛苦让生命在两年的时间里逐渐凋零，也可以选择三年令人作呕的治疗 、 “ 化疗脑 ” 、 掉头发和失去生命尊严。	In other words, you can have two years of gradual decline with some pain, or three years of nauseating treatments, “chemo brain,” loss of hair, and diminished dignity.
它无法命令这些机构去更改法则，也无法在各机构的不同标准之间达成一致，或者在不同国家的监管者之间获得同样的执行效果。	It cannot instruct them to change their rules. Nor can it achieve consistency between different standard setters’ approaches, or, indeed, consistency of implementation by different national regulators.
根据法国费加罗杂志所做的一项民意调查，萨尔科奇一月份的民众支持率猛跌八个点，仅仅达到41 % ， 这是他上台以来最低的，而七月份最高曾经达到65 % 。	According to the TNS Sofres poll for Le Figaro Magazine, Sarkozy’s popularity tumbled a whopping eight percentage points in January, to just 41%, the lowest level since he took office last May and down from a high of 65% in July.
一旦这些行业认清如何让其IT系统更高效、更具互操作性、更加用户友好，然后重组程序以利用技术能力，生产率就会大幅攀升。	Once these industries figured out how to make their IT systems more efficient, interoperable, and user-friendly, and then realigned their processes to leverage technology’s capabilities, productivity soared.
但是，随着2014年的深入，出现了令人担忧的比较 — — 不是和1914年，而是一些两次大战之间的更凶险的特点。	But, as it progressed, disturbing parallels appeared – not to 1914, but to some of the nastier features of the interwar years.
让问题更加复杂的是，韩国总统文在寅政府坚持认为强有力的激励和更深层次的融合能够比制裁更有效地实现无核化目标。	Complicating matters further, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s administration has embraced the view that strong incentives and deeper integration are more effective than sanctions for bringing about denuclearization.
中间偏左政党在其冗长乏味的竞选计划中提议将收入税减少5个百分点，但没有说明从哪里支付执行这一政策所需的100亿欧元。	The center-left’s ponderous electoral program proposes a cut of five percentage points in payroll taxes, but it is not clear where the required €10 billion will come from to pay for this.
1991年苏联解体后，俄罗斯总统叶利钦显然忘了把它要回，于是乌克兰拥有了这块拥有两百万居民、其中近60%认为自己是俄罗斯人的领土。	After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russian President Boris Yeltsin apparently forgot to claim it back, so Ukraine kept a territory in which nearly 60% of the two million inhabitants identify as Russians.
当然，莫布图（Mobutu）肆无忌惮的腐败令我们不得不更审慎地进行对外援助，既要重视资金的用途，还要关注谁在负责“发放”资金。	Of course, Mobutu’s boundless corruption challenges us to be thoughtful about foreign aid, both about how the money is spent and who is responsible for “delivering” assistance.
两大盟友之间的争议部分地反映了它们不同的当务之急：对以色列来说，红线是伊朗马上就要上马的深层地下铀浓缩设施；而对美国来说，最紧迫的问题是专门用于军事目的的核设施。	The controversy between the two allies partly reflects their divergent timelines: for Israel, the red line is Iran’s imminent burial deep underground of its uranium-enrichment facilities; for the US, it is the start of a dedicated weapons program.
好像伊拉克国内的逊尼派-什叶派分裂问题还不够棘手似的，现在又出现了一个更深刻、甚至问题更大的裂痕 — — 土耳其与其自身身份和外部划定的边界的斗争。	As if the Sunni-Shia divide within Iraq were not difficult enough, a deeper and even more problematic fissure has now emerged – Turkey’s own struggles with its identity and its externally imposed borders.
在西方，把女人当作财产的说法对应着高度个性化的个人自主权要求 — — 即按照妇女自身的愿望做出决定，而不顾及她作为妻子、母亲、社会成员或宗教信徒的社会角色。	In the West, the counterpoint to the notion of woman as property has been a highly individualistic demand for personal autonomy – decision-making based primarily on a woman’s own wishes, rather than as wife, mother, community member, or worshipper.
影响的严重性取决于英国及其欧洲伙伴如何谈判棘手的分离问题，特别是自由贸易和金融畅通可以在多大程度上得到保留。	The severity of the effects will depend on how the UK and its European partners negotiate their tricky separation, particularly the extent to which free trade and financial passporting are upheld.
此类众议院席位很容易在2018年倒向民主党人，如果敏这样的候选人可以说服选民沃尔特斯并未倾听民意 — — 而且与特朗普过于亲密。	This kind of House seat can easily flip to the Democrats in 2018, if a candidate like Min can persuade voters that Walters is out of touch – and too close to Trump.
货币贬值能行得通，因为这样会使进口产品更加昂贵，出口产品更加便宜，而提高增值税，削减工资税也能发挥这样的作用。	A currency devaluation works by making imports more costly and exports cheaper. A VAT/payroll-tax swap would do exactly the same thing.
破产方案的第二个问题在于国际监管机构 — — 出于自身的法律和程序因素 — — 而无法配合一个会对本国经济造成重大影响的美国法律程序。	The second problem with the bankruptcy approach is that international regulators would find themselves unable to cooperate – for their own legal and procedural reasons – with a US process that affects a major part of their own economies.
毕竟，中国是可能有能力让全球经济复苏全力启动的国家；但其自身经济增长的基础正在日益表现出吃紧的信号。	After all, China is the one country that might be able to jump-start the sputtering global economy’s recovery; and yet its own economic growth is based on a foundation that is increasingly showing signs of strain.
因此 ， “ 劳动阶级所持有的观点，即机器的使用往往不利于他们的利益，并不是建立在偏见和错误的基础之上，反而十分符合政治经济学的正确原理 。 ”	As a result, “the opinion entertained by the laboring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy.”
我们可以量或如此多的东西，这一事实意味着有时我们会放弃更难度量的挑战 — — 如腐败、食品质量和教育。	The fact that we can quantify so many things means that sometimes we abandon the challenges that are harder to measure – such as corruption, food quality, or education.
此外，以色列应该利用埃及在促进最新停火协议中的关键作用作为扩大与这个开罗的新伊斯兰政权的双边对话以讨论和平和地区安全问题的契机。	Moreover, Israel should use Egypt’s vital role in brokering the recent cease-fire as an opportunity to expand the bilateral dialogue with the new Islamist regime in Cairo to include issues of peace and regional security.
如今美国政客和学界所讨论和采取的政策 — — 量化宽松、财政刺激、政府赤字削减 — — 都是治疗深层次问题的药方。	The policies adopted or discussed by American policymakers and scholars nowadays – quantitative easing, fiscal-stimulus packages, government-deficit reduction – seek to cure only the symptoms of a deeper malaise.
另一所很有前途的创新院校是西部州长大学，一所由19位州长创办、服务全美58,000名学生的私营非盈利在线机构。	Another promising innovator is Western Governors University, a private nonprofit online institution founded by 19 state governors that serves about 58,000 students spread across the US.
但尽管各类人均指标有助于评估一个国家的消费潜力，却并不足以充分体现其增长潜力，因为它们把不会为生产作出贡献的老人小孩都涵盖在内。	But, while per capita indicators are useful for assessing a country’s consumption potential, they do not provide an adequate picture of growth potential, because they include the elderly and the young, who do not contribute to production.
如果他们的选择可以被引导，那不是赤裸裸的家长式作风是什么？ 这样做更不道德，因为个人并不知道他们被助推了，从而根本无从捍卫自己的权利。	If their choices can be directed, is this not paternalism plain and simple, rendered more sinister because individuals are unaware that they are being nudged, and cannot raise their guard?
因此，如今我们可能仍处于IMF所谓的“新平庸 ” （ new mediocre ） 、 拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）所谓的“长期停滞”和中国人所谓的“新常态”中。	Thus, for the time being, we are likely to remain in what the IMF calls the “new mediocre,” Larry Summers calls “secular stagnation,” and the Chinese call the “new normal.”
直接的计算显示减排比执行照常的政策要好，就是说，利益的当前价值超过了代价的当前价值 — — 对于任何低于8.5%的社会时间偏好率而言。	A straightforward calculation shows that mitigation is better than business as usual – that is, the present value of the benefits exceeds the present value of the costs – for any social rate of time preference less than 8.5%.
如果医生建议采用极为昂贵而又没有效果的阿斯匹林来治疗腿坏疽是因为阿斯匹林的成本要低于断腿的代价，那么我们将永远不会接受。	We would never accept medical practitioners advising ultra-expensive and ineffective aspirins for gangrene because the cost of aspirin outweighs the cost of losing the leg.
你或许会批评布洛克观点的某些细节：如果能够根深地理解凯恩斯，他将能更有力地反驳“如果国家出资的项目值得进行，那么私人部门早就在这么做了”之类的诘难。	One can criticize details of Brock’s case: a deeper understanding of Keynes would have given him a more persuasive response to the objection that, if state-financed projects were worth doing, the private sector would be doing them.
就像大生产系统一样，它们具有“固有政治性 ” （ inherently political ） ， 因为它们的核心功能要求某些社会行为、阻碍其他社会行为。	Like the system of mass production, they are “inherently political,” because their core functionality demands certain social practices and discourages others.
由于国家利用其下属机构来遏制竞争 — — 无论是非正式地利用针对财产所有权的执法，或是正式利用种种贸易管制政策 — — 权贵资本主义不仅不公平，而且也缺乏效率。	Because the state uses its apparatus to deter competition – both informally, through arbitrary enforcement of property rights, and formally, through trade restrictions – crony capitalism is not only unjust, but also inefficient.
但是，这一狭隘目标方法的一个后果是决策者无视资产和商品价格泡沫的形成，并忽略由此带来的银行部门不稳定。	But, as a consequence of this narrow approach, policymakers disregarded the formation of asset- and commodity-price bubbles, and overlooked the resulting banking-sector instability.
人们抱怨特朗普政府的无序，但克林顿的白宫同样组织混乱，以至于他不得不让莱昂·帕内塔（Leon Panetta）担任幕僚长、大卫·葛根（David Gergen）担任沟通官来拨乱反正。	People complain about disorder in the Trump administration, but Clinton’s White House was so disorganized that he had to bring in Leon Panetta as Chief of Staff and David Gergen as a communications counselor to right the ship.
它不允许大范围的全面破产，在这类破产中，倒闭的业务将在法院保护下关闭，有盈利能力的业务将被出售，债务将围绕公司资产负债表进行重组。	It would not allow broad-spectrum, full-scale bankruptcies, in which failing operations are closed under the court’s aegis, viable operations are sold, and debts are restructured up and down a company’s balance sheet.
听到这一消息我兴奋不已。 我在过去四年时间里一直奔波，为的是确保美国的关押和审讯政策符合法治，包括监督关塔纳摩湾的军事审判。	I was elated by the decision, having spent four years working on ensuring the rule of law in US detention and interrogation policy, including monitoring military commission trials at Guantánamo Bay.
事实上，此人在民族主义反对派阵营中根本没什么地位，车臣叛军中也没几个人会把他当指挥官看待；而他最近派遣密使，试图组建一支由自己指挥的武装力量的举动也最终宣告失败。	His position in the nationalist opposition was weak. There seem to be few, if any, fighters in Chechnya who recognize him as commander; his recent attempt to send an emissary to create a fighting unit directly under his command was not successful.
通过开发森林在大规模碳捕获和储存过程中所发挥的经济价值 ， “ 减少因森林砍伐和退化所造成的碳排放计划”可以让森林与导致森林砍伐的伐木或农业等利润丰厚的土地使用形式展开竞争。	By putting an economic value on forests for the role they play in large-scale carbon capture and storage, REDD+ allows standing trees to compete with lucrative land uses – such as logging or agriculture – that result in deforestation.
来自海湾国家的汇款将会减少，外包业务会遇到挫折，但是基础设施投资却很有希望，印度在这方面一直欠债，它希望继续这方面的高速增长。	Remittances from the Gulf States will suffer and its outsourcing business will languish, but hopefully infrastructure investments, of which India has a great backlog, will continue apace.
事实上，我最近正在读迪特里希·朋霍费尔令人赞叹且极具挑战性的《狱中书简》一书，他在书中渴望有一个能向世界（我们的世界）施恩的救世主，随后又能为了一个人的福祉而殉道。	Indeed, I have recently been reading Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s sublime and challenging Letters from Prison, in which he yearns for a Christ capable of offering mercy to a world, our world, then in the process of being martyred for a single man.
但如果移民治理不负责任、缺少合作，这些好处就很容易被挥霍浪费，我们在地中海、安达曼海、中美洲走廊、萨赫勒和非洲之角所看到的危机就是如此。	But these benefits are easily squandered if, as we’ve seen recently with crises in the Mediterranean Sea, the Andaman Sea, the Central American corridor, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa, migration is not governed responsibly and cooperatively.
危机最有可能的原因是银行的掠夺式放贷，因此人民自然感到十分愤怒，要求银行家下台、减少银行高管薪酬 — — 这一情绪甚至激发了当前风靡全球的“占领华尔街”运动。	Its proximate cause was predatory bank lending, so people are naturally angry and want heads and bonuses to roll – a sentiment captured by the current worldwide protests against “Wall Street.”
鉴于实际有效汇率对经济政策的重要性（例如在当前中美贸易讨论中 ） ， 各国央行和国际金融机构在计算和分析实际有效汇率方面投入了相当多的资源。	The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.
中国现在是世界第二大国民经济体，而且填补了西方债权人撤退所留下的空白，同时也成为全球新兴市场最主要的信贷供应国。	China is now the world’s second-largest national economy and the leading supplier of credit to emerging markets globally, having filled the gap left by retreating Western creditors.
另一方面，对于中国消费者来说，如果有了一定的社会保障，少了对医疗保健，子女的教育和退休后的养老问题的担忧，他们就会更敢于消费。	Chinese consumers, on the other hand, might actually start spending more of their income if they can worry a bit less about saving for health care, their children’s education, and their old-age retirement.
值得注意的是，我还收获了来自自然科学专业人士的评论，表示民众对专家信任度越来越低的现象在他们的学科领域也普遍存在着。	Remarkably, I also received comments from professionals in the natural sciences who said that citizens’ growing distrust of experts was pervasive in their disciplines, too.
自2016年政变失败以来，土耳其法庭已经审理了约4，6000起涉及起诉民众侮辱总统、民族或国家机构的案子。	Since a failed coup attempt in 2016, Turkey’s courts have processed some 46,000 cases involving people accused of insulting the president, the nation, or its institutions.
实现这一目标的一个办法是成立“工作委员会 ” ， 遴选雇员小组赋予其包括工作条件在内的信息和咨询权。	One way to achieve this is by establishing “works councils,” elected groups of employees with rights to information and consultation, including on working conditions.
另一个极端是世界由完全孤立的独裁国家组成，个体不必受到外部经济力量影响，国家对内政拥有完全的自决权。	The other extreme is a world comprising entirely isolated autarchic states, where individuals are protected from external economic forces and the state has full autonomy over domestic affairs.
因此，我在这里对2004年在这一领域通过的一揽子方案深表失望。 有几个成员国未能在既定的期限内转换这套旨在使流程简单化和现代化的方案。	I am, therefore, deeply disappointed that a package of measures adopted in this area in 2004 – aimed at simplifying and modernizing procedures – has not been transposed within the agreed deadline by several member states.
而美国证券交易委员会所否决的几个提案正是为了让货币市场基金更加稳固，要求每个基金保持资本储备或者任其“浮动 ” — —而不是凑整 — — 来体现真实和潜在的风险。	The proposals that the SEC rejected were aimed at making money-market funds more robust by requiring that each fund maintain capital reserves or let its value “float” – and not be rounded up – to reflect its true, underlying risk.
但是，正如卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和肯·罗格夫（Ken Rogoff）很早前便指出的，后危机时期的复苏通常是缓慢而痛苦的。	But, as Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff have long documented, post-crisis healing is typically slow and painful.
一个更好的方法将则是建立一个精心设计的主权违约机制，一方面减少危机的破坏，另一方面也防止借款人觉得能靠纳税人的钱来解决所有大麻烦。	A better approach would be to create a mechanism for orchestrating orderly sovereign default, both to minimize damage when crises do occur, and to discourage lenders from assuming that taxpayers’ money will solve all major problems.
近几十年来，脆弱和经济不安全随短暂、临时、无保障的就业（包括自由职业、兼职工、短工、临时工和随叫随到工作）的增加而增加。	In recent decades, vulnerability and economic insecurity have increased with the rise of transient, casual, and precarious employment, including self-employment, and part-time, fixed-term, temporary, and on-call jobs.
2011年，我们可能目睹上述意愿是否会引导中国领导人重新评价自己的外交政策，这样的外交政策导致中国在亚洲的可靠盟友只剩下腐败并陷入经济困境的缅甸和北朝鲜。	In 2011 we may begin to see whether those incentives lead China’s rulers to re-appraise their diplomatic conduct, which has left them with only the corrupt, basket case economies of Burma and North Korea as reliable friends in Asia.
但这一承诺至今形同虚设，SDR只是在危机爆发时发放过几次，包括2009年所发放的相当于2500亿美元的SDR。	But this commitment has remained a dead letter, except for periodic emissions of SDRs during crises, including the equivalent of $250 billion in 2009.
最近对于此项规定的修改允许银行收回房子，但是它们必须协助安排贷款者住进价格便宜一些的替代住房。 对于放贷者来说要将此付诸实施简直是一个行政性噩梦，尤其是如果有很多人同时开始违约的话。	A recent revision of that decision permits banks to repossess homes, but only if they help arrange alternative lower-cost housing – an administrative nightmare for lenders, particularly if a lot of people start defaulting at the same time.
尽管2017年世界银行的一项研究将重建代价确定为2，250亿美元左右，但最近的评估显示重建总成本接近4，000亿美元；还有人预计重建总费用将接近万亿美元。	While a 2017 World Bank study puts the price at around $225 billion, more recent assessments suggest a total closer to $400 billion; others expect the sum to approach $1 trillion.
考虑到中国鞭策国内公司赴海外投资的“走出去政策”以及建设洲际贸易基础设施的“一带一路”框架的合力，这一趋势还将持续下去。	This trend can only continue, considering the combined impact of China’s “Go Out Policy” of prodding domestic companies to make investments abroad, and it’s “One Belt, One Road” framework to build continent-wide trade infrastructure.
当公众对普京吞并克里米亚之举的支持逐渐退去 — — 这是迟早的事 — — 他的失败在MH17航班坠毁事件面前更加显露无疑了。	When public support for Putin’s annexation of Crimea wanes – as it will – his failings will shine more starkly in the light of the MH17 catastrophe.
因此，尽管人们常说犹太人在华盛顿游说实力很强，但大部分犹太人将继续投票反对特朗普，即使他对以色列政府简直俯首帖耳，而对巴勒斯坦人充满敌意。	This is why, despite much talk of powerful Jewish lobbies in Washington, most Jews will continue to vote against Trump, even though he is an almost slavish supporter of the Israeli government and openly hostile to the Palestinians.
一旦发生那种情况，对于周边国家 — — 以及整个世界经济 — — 的影响将比欧洲目前所面临的问题更为严重。	Once that happens, the impact on neighboring countries – and on the world economy – will be huge compared to the current European problem.
与此相对的是，新办法采取了不可知论的立场，承认我们并不知道什么会起作用，并认为束缚发展的约束往往要具体问题具体分析。	By contrast, the new approaches are agnostic. They acknowledge that we do not know what works, and that the binding constraints to development tend to be context-specific.
首先，这些经济体在太长的时间里沉溺于开放国际贸易、吸引外国直接投资、价格自由化以及实现宏观经济稳定。	First, for too long, these economies have been obsessed with opening to international trade, attracting foreign direct investment, liberalizing prices, and achieving macroeconomic stabilization.
为了有效影响变化 — — 不仅仅是为了妇女 — — 我们需要对计划生育的支持、妇女和儿童卫生服务以及对赋权项目的支持。	To truly affect change – and not only for women – we need global support for access to family planning, women’s and children’s health services, and support for empowerment initiatives.
幸运的是，虽然叛军飞机从因吉尔利空军基地起飞，但政变并没有导致美国储存在该基地的数十件核武器落入叛军之手。	Luckily, it did not end with rebel forces seizing some of the dozens of US nuclear weapons stored at Turkey’s Incirlik Air Base, from which rebel aircraft departed.
其次，LEBACS年名义利率已经提高到40 % — —为世界最高，并 有可能导致央行债务如滚雪球般膨胀。	Second, the annual nominal interest rate on the LEBACS was raised to 40% – the highest in the world, and a move that risks creating a snowball of central-bank debt.
美国很快地利用了亚洲地区由中国日渐增长的实力自信所触发的担忧情绪，强化了与原有亚洲盟国的军事关系，并打造了一批新的安全伙伴。	The United States, quick to capitalize on regional concerns triggered by China’s increasingly muscular self-assertion, has strengthened its military ties with its existing Asian allies and forged security relationships with new friends.
我们完全知道如何预防和治疗结核病，投资于消灭结核病也能带来巨大的经济收益，因此，没有理由继续因此承受沉重的生命损失。	Given all that we know about how to prevent and treat TB, and a powerful economic case for investing in eradication efforts, there is no excuse for the heavy toll that it continues to take.
但如今，虽然市场对特朗普的“企业友好”政策 — — 不仅包括去监管化和减税，也包括万亿美元规模的基础设施计划，其中包括复兴煤炭业的措施 — — 反应积极，商界领袖仍然保持谨慎。	But today, even as markets respond bullishly to Trump’s “business-friendly” pledges – not just deregulation and tax cuts, but also a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would include reviving coal – business leaders have remained cautious.
但是鉴于任何成功的民主转型必须包括文官控制大部分军队和安全机构，最高军事委员会的最低要求可能会使这个过程毫无意义。	But, given that any successful democratic transition must include meaningful civilian control over the armed forces and the security apparatus, the SCAF’s minimum demands could render the process meaningless.
这个词似乎更多地被批评者使用，通常的用途是谴责已成落水狗的法西斯主义，另一个该词汇的使用群体常常歌颂“新”社团主义的要素。	The term seems to have been used most often by critics, often to denounce the defunct Fascist philosophy, or by those extolling elements of a “new” corporatism.
最近的经验数据表明能够从欧盟成员国地位受益的中东欧地区绝大部分是在该国首都的周围或者与15国之一的某个国家接壤的地区。	Recent empirical evidence suggests that the central and eastern European regions benefiting most from EU membership are those around the country’s capital city or sharing a border with one of the 15 countries.
这是一项前所未有的举措，不仅是印度，在全世界几乎所有地方都是如此，其程度之激进远超莫迪迄今为止的所有政策干预。	It was an unprecedented move, whether in India or almost anywhere else, and it is by far Modi’s boldest policy intervention to date.
尽管某些足球比赛曾经激起暴力，甚至有一次引发了战争，但它们可能已经通过转移注意力，抑制了我们更加野蛮的冲动。	Even though some football games have provoked violence, and in one case even a war, they might have served the positive purpose of containing our more savage impulses by deflecting them onto a mere sport.
而且，愤怒而失业的年青也门男子经常成为另一个沙特错误政策的目标 — — 沙特向他们宣传输出伊斯兰逊尼派瓦哈比教义。	Embittered and unemployed, young Yemeni men often become subject to another Saudi policy gone awry – its propagation for export of the Sunni Wahhabi form of Islam.
25年前，就在这个星期，一些激进的学生袭击了驻德黑兰的美国使馆，把66个美国人扣为人质，关押了444天后，美伊之间的正式关系就几乎不复存在了。	Relations between the United States and Iran have been officially non-existent since a group of radical students stormed the US embassy in Teheran – 25 years ago this week – taking sixty six Americans hostage for 444 days.
我们应该强调美国领导地位的重要性，而不是关注谁能替代美国 — — 这样有助于刺激美国重新承担起国际责任。	Rather than focusing our attention on alternatives to US leadership, we should be emphasizing its importance – an approach that would help to spur the US to rededicate itself to its international responsibilities.
事实上，格鲁吉亚战争使俄罗斯不仅同西方而且同中国树了敌。 维持后冷战时期地缘战略的安定性，对中国具有重要的战略利益。	Indeed, the Georgian war antagonized not only the west, but also China, which has a vital strategic interest in maintaining the post-Cold War geo-strategic settlement.
尼克松离疯狂还差得很远，尽管他在水门丑闻高潮时期的疯狂酗酒行为曾促使基辛格和国防部长詹姆斯·施莱辛格设计了一套针对他对核密码控制权的监控手段。	Nixon was far from mad, though his heavy drinking at the height of the Watergate scandal prompted Kissinger and Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger to establish a way to monitor his control of the nuclear codes.
把伊拉克从过去35年所忍受的梦魇中解救出来并不取决于任何单个人；实际上，萨达姆统治的基本要素就是依赖于“某个个人 ” 。	Iraq’s salvation from the nightmare that it endured over the previous 35 years lies not in any one man; indeed, reliance on “one man” was the central ingredient in Saddamist rule.
10亿人缺乏饮用水、20亿人缺乏合理的污水处理系统所带来的迫切需求，再加上随之而来的大量疾病，使这项基本人权的认定变得非常重要。	The urgency of the needs, with a billion people lacking access to drinking water and two billion without proper sewer systems, together with the vast number of diseases that result, underscore the need to recognize such a fundamental human right.
非洲是移动银行的先锋，M-Pesa等本地公司和花旗银行等跨国公司证明了新技术可以为无法接触到银行的人口提供至关重要的金融服务。	Africa has pioneered the use of mobile banking, with local players like M-Pesa and global corporations like Citi demonstrating how new technology can provide vital financial services to the unbanked population.
还有刑法典第377条，该法实施于1860年，规定“有悖于自然规律的肉体关系”为犯罪 — — 如此“老封建”的用词足以引起现代社会的嗤笑。	Then there is Section 377 of the penal code, which was enacted in 1860 and criminalizes “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” – wording so archaic that it would invite derision in most modern societies.
在其他许多领域我们需要实施公共政策，包括通过立法把环境成本融入到食品价格中以鼓励可持续的生产，以及加强激励和监管措施以促进对水更高效的使用。	Public policy is needed in many other areas, including legislation to incorporate environmental costs into food prices, thereby encouraging sustainable production, as well as incentives and regulations to promote more efficient water use.
类似地，在印度的拉贾斯坦邦，由分散性妇女自助团地制作的高质量补充性食物正在改善6—36个月大的儿童的营养。	Similarly, in India’s Rajasthan state, high-quality complementary foods produced by decentralized women’s self-help groups are improving the nutrition of children aged 6-36 months.
从2006年到2013年，非洲的许多最重要经济体，包括南非、尼日利亚、加纳、坦桑尼亚和卢旺达等，不平等性都有所上升。	From 2006 to 2013, inequality rose in many of the continent’s most important economies, including South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, and Rwanda.
将这些历史事实和神话中的象头移植相提并论是对科学 — — 以及实现这些科学成就、因此值得人们敬仰的人 — — 的严重亵渎。	Subsuming these historical facts in a narrative about mythological transplanted elephant heads did science – and the people whose achievements deserve to be honored – a serious disservice.
支持英国退欧或特朗普的人并不只是因为无法理解全球化的真正好处；他们目前缺少技能或机会保证能够分得一杯羹。	Those who voted for Brexit or Trump did not simply fail to understand the true benefits of globalization; they currently lack the skills or opportunities to secure a piece of the pie.
但在国内，那些小规模而且独特的法国商业 — — 奶酪生产商，法式蛋糕店或者法国餐厅 — — 却被高税率和社会福利支出压得喘不过气来，另一边，那些销售“亚洲制造”的超级市场却生意兴隆。	At home, meanwhile, small, distinctively French businesses – cheese makers, patisseries, or restaurateurs – get hammered by heavy taxes and social-welfare costs while supermarkets flourish selling products from Asia.
有趣的是，尽管这一下降趋势主要出现在特别倚重金融市场的发达经济体，但在两位作者所研究的95个国家中，几乎每一个都能察觉到这一变化。	What is interesting is that while this decline is most marked in advanced economies, which are especially dependent on financial markets, it is visible in virtually all of the 95 countries that the authors studied.
而且可能不会有太多警告，因为气候影响通常不会以线性方式逐渐演变，而是突然剧烈出现，一旦我们实现对某个临界点的突破。	And we may not get much warning, because climate effects generally do not evolve in a linear fashion, but rather emerge suddenly and powerfully, once certain tipping points have been reached.
中国服务业表现在近几年中令人印象深刻，据官方数据，其占GDP之比从2010年的44%提高到2015年前三季度的51.6 % 。	The performance of China’s services sector has been especially impressive in recent years, with its share of GDP increasing from 44% in 2010 to 51.6% in the first three quarters of 2015, according to official statistics.
到2020年，全球互联网人口将达到五十亿；创建十亿新机器对机器（machine-to-machine）连接；移动数据量将增长11倍。	By 2020, the global Internet population will reach five billion; ten billion new machine-to-machine connections will be created; and mobile data traffic will rise 11-fold.
此外，这与美国长期以来的承诺 — — 坚持基于规则的货币体系，遏制竞争性货币贬值 — — 也背道而驰。	Moreover, it amounts to a betrayal of the longstanding US commitment to uphold a rules-based monetary system that discourages competitive currency devaluation.
事实上，在2012年4月举行的卡塔赫纳美洲峰会上，拉美领导人认为有充分的信心联合起来挑战美国在该地区的主导权。	Indeed, at the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena in April 2012, Latin American leaders felt sufficiently confident and united to challenge US priorities in the region.
我们在一些国家看到的收入与民主之间的正相关性可能是一种因果倒置：民主由于国家日渐富裕而很可能会更稳固。	The positive correlation between income and democracy that one sees across countries could be due to reverse causation: democracy is more likely to persist as a country grows richer.
这使得建立在狭小领域推理的“专家系统”或是设计寻找离散事实的搜索引擎成为可能，但我们距离能够以我们的方式 — — 在包括时间的众多环境中穿梭自如 — — 进行推理的AI还有很长的路要走。	While this makes it possible to build “expert systems” that reason in narrow domains, or to design search engines that can find discrete facts, we are no closer to AI that reasons the way that we do – in and across multiple contexts, including time.
因为很多所谓“德国生产”的汽车及其他出口产品也包含了许多生产自中东欧地区的零件，所以在增值方面，德国占全球出口的比例已经到了历史的最低点 。 。	Because cars and other exports “made in Germany” now contain many parts produced in central and eastern Europe, Germany’s share of global exports is at a record low in value-added terms.
同时尽管美国总统奥巴马不断阻挠，由中国带头发起的亚洲基础设施投资银行依旧顺利成立，并在这个月开始运作。	And, despite US President Barack Obama’s resistance, the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was established as well, and is to start operation this month.
基督徒和穆斯林教徒在萨拉热窝和平共处了几百年，直到武装势力支持下的塞尔维亚激进分子号召人们进行暴力驱逐和杀戮。	Christians and Muslims coexisted for centuries in Sarajevo, until Serb agitators, backed by armed forces, called for violent expulsions and murder.
这就是我们可能称之为“非相关性”的辩护：原来金融理论家们可以不负责任，是因为没有人在现实世界里关注他们！	This amounts to what we might call an “irrelevance” defense: Finance theorists cannot be held responsible, since no one in the real world pays attention to them!
"在442名受访者中，11%的人回答 ： "" 是，我非常担心 "" ， 36%的人回答 ： "" 是，我有点担心 "" ， 而有55%的人回答 ： "" 不，我毫不担心 。 """	"Of 442 respondents, 11% answered, ""Yes, I worry a lot,"" 36% replied, ""Yes, I worry a little,"" and 52% said, ""No, I don't worry at all."""
如果未来的试验能表现出同样出色的疗效，那么低成本的气泡新生儿呼吸机可以成为资源匮乏地区治疗肺炎的标准疗法，从而每年可以因此挽救成千上万条生命。	If future trials demonstrate similar high efficacy, low-cost bubble CPAP could become the standard of care for pneumonia in resource-deprived settings, potentially saving thousands of lives every year.
尽管首次袭击发生之后，巴基斯坦考古学家一再呼吁当地政府保护坐佛和其他古迹，但政府却没有采取任何措施。	Despite repeated requests by Pakistani archeologists to the local authorities to protect the seated Buddha and other sites, especially after the first attack, no action was taken.
如果欧洲对希腊选民改变政策的要求说“不 ” ， 就无异于表示民主毫无重要性可言，至少在经济上毫无重要性。	If Europe says no to Greek voters’ demand for a change of course, it is saying that democracy is of no importance, at least when it comes to economics.
事实上，美联储决定推迟升息的部分原因正是美国决策者预期美元升值将拉低进口品价格，从而妨碍其实现2%通胀目标的能力。	Indeed, the Fed decided to delay raising interest rates partly because US policymakers expect dollar appreciation, by lowering import prices, to undermine their ability to meet their 2% inflation target.
凭借一个充斥着高盛校友的内阁，以及一个在为超富阶层减税的同时私有化医保和教育的承诺，特朗普让那些选他进入白宫的白人工薪阶层失望是命中注定的。	With an administration full of Goldman Sachs alumni, and an agenda that promises tax cuts for the super-rich while privatizing Medicare and education, Trump is bound to disappoint the white working class that won him the White House.
在肯尼亚，每月22美元的付款可能已经可以很好地消除贫困；但在将成年人贫困线定在年收入1.27万美元（2016年官方标准）的美国，这点钱根本不算钱。	In Kenya, a $22 monthly payment might very well eradicate poverty; but it would be “chump change” in the US, where the official poverty line for an adult in 2016 was $12,700 per year.
它不仅与俄罗斯有实质性关系；而且也与土耳其关系密切，具体表现为2010年两国曾试图与伊朗就其核计划问题达成协议。	Not only does it have substantial ties with Russia; it is also linked to Turkey, exemplified by the two countries’ 2010 effort to broker a deal with Iran over its nuclear program.
伦敦—工业革命伊始，英格兰中部和北部的纺织工人（以织布工为主）发动了一场自发的抵抗运动，砸毁机器、烧毁工厂。	LONDON – At the start of the Industrial Revolution, textile workers in the Midlands and the North of England, mainly weavers, staged a spontaneous revolt, smashing machinery and burning factories.
这一“想象的历史 ” — — “ 事实和虚构的混合，有时候只有虚构 ” — —成为“象征性的真实 ” 。	This “imagined history” – “a mixture of fact and fiction, or sometimes only fiction” – becomes “symbolically true.”
但各国不但没有落实旨在实现上述目标的政策，反而继续在补贴化石燃料工业的同时，利用稀缺的公共资源探寻新的储量。	But instead of implementing policies aimed at realizing that objective, governments continue not only to subsidize the fossil-fuel industry, but also to use scarce public resources to find new reserves.
银行获得了规模史无前例的援助，而那些向银行贷款的国家却在削减社会福利项目，并因此面临着不断高涨的社会矛盾和政治不稳定状况。	Banks are receiving ever-larger bailouts, while countries that borrowed are cutting social programs and face rising social tensions and political instability as a result.
发自法兰克福 — — 在得知伊曼纽尔·马克隆（Emmanuel Macron）赢得了法国总统大选时，许多德国人都大大地松了一口气，庆幸一位亲欧洲的中间派政治家彻底击败了一个极右翼民粹主义者 — — 国民阵线的玛琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen ） 。	FRANKFURT – When Emmanuel Macron won the French presidential election, many Germans breathed a loud sigh of relief. A pro-European centrist had soundly defeated a far-right populist, the National Front’s Marine Le Pen.
人们计划在哥伦比亚建设七座联合军事设施，并且对垄断作物熏蒸市场的美国私人承包商的支持很可能也不会动摇。	In Colombia, seven new joint military installations are planned, and support for US private contractors who have cornered the market in crop fumigation presumably will not be interrupted.
我们早已意识到，这一进程充满未知变数，但如果我们连试都不试，这些已经意识到的未知数必将继续挑战一切局部性的解决方案。	It’s an equation with very many known unknowns, but if we do not try at least to mitigate these issues, the known unknowns will continue challenging all partial solutions.
现在的问题不是日本是否需要修改宪法第9条，而是何时加以修改，在第九条的限制下，日本军队只能发挥自卫作用。	It is a question of when, not if, the Japanese amend Article IX of their constitution, which limits the role of Japan’s armed forces to self-defense.
同理，在终结了智利军事强人奥古斯托·皮诺切特16年统治的1990年公投中，即便皮氏手中握着数千条惨遭折磨和杀害的冤魂，却依然凭着一套鼓吹法律与秩序的纲领赢得了44%的赞成票。	Likewise, in the referendum that ended his 16-year rule in Chile in 1990, General Augusto Pinochet, with thousands of tortured and vanished victims in his grisly cupboard, ran on a law-and-order platform and received 44% of the vote.
西方多年来一直坚持叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德是问题所在，但现在却有越来越多的西方决策者和战略家将其视为解决方案 — — 或至少是过渡方案的组成部分。	After years of insisting that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was the problem, a growing number of Western policymakers and strategists are now suggesting that he may actually be part of the solution – or at least the transition.
有几个理由导致日本政府一直抵制西方从里根/撒切尔时代就一直崇尚的新自由主义理念：它们是企业利益、官僚特权和各种各样的分肥政治。	There are several reasons why Japanese governments have resisted the neoliberalism promoted in the West since the Reagan/Thatcher years: corporate interests, bureaucratic privileges, and pork-barrel politics of various kinds.
波兰现在面临被西方孤立和国际影响力的丧失，导致该国在面对弗拉基米尔·普京领导下俄国的复仇时显得无能为力。	Poland now faces the threat of isolation by the West and loss of international influence, leaving the country vulnerable to Vladimir Putin’s revanchist Russia.
特别是，美国与印度的关系一直在经历蒂勒森所谓的“重大转变 ” ， 两国“日益成为在战略上越来越趋同的全球合作伙伴 ” 。	America’s relationship with India, in particular, has been undergoing what Tillerson called a “profound transformation,” as the two countries become “increasingly global partners with growing strategic convergence.”
英国与欧盟的谈判以似曾相识的方式一次又一次地遭到了拖延，而人们也已经达成了共识：英国所遭受的经济下行冲击将远超欧盟，更别说其他国家了。	The UK’s negotiations with the EU have dragged on through multiple déjà vu moments, and the consensus is that the economic fallout will be felt far more acutely in Britain than in the EU, let alone in countries elsewhere.
不同的国家的数百名科学家以撰稿者或评论者的身份参与了这些报告的撰写，这或许是历史上对科学问题进行国际评估的最全面和最彻底的一次。	Many hundreds of scientists from different countries were involved as contributors and reviewers for these reports, which are probably the most comprehensive and thorough international assessments on any scientific subject ever carried out.
但这一届的三位总统候选人—尼古拉•塞尔科奇, 赛格琳•罗亚尔, 和弗朗索瓦•贝鲁—却令竞选活动呈现出全然不同的情况。	But the three main candidates this time around – Nicolas Sarkozy, Ségolène Royal, and François Bayrou – have given an entirely different shape to this campaign.
如果最近批驳中等收入陷阱的研究是正确的，那么中国 — — 历史上最不可思议的增长故事之一 — — 很有希望带着同样的力道成功进入高收入行列。	If the recent research debunking the middle-income trap is correct, China – one of history’s most miraculous growth stories – has a very good chance of succeeding in the transition to high-income status with similar vigor.
（平心而论，美国代表团有时也有自相矛盾之处，常常是官员对伊朗包含敌意，而训练有素的外交官则根据奥巴马的要求寻求达成协议。 ）	(To be sure, the US delegation has also appeared inconsistent at times, often including officials vehemently hostile to Iran, along with disciplined diplomats seeking an agreement at Obama’s request.)
2006年9月，布什总统和胡锦涛主席确认美中经济关系的重要性和复杂性，并且在两国之间建立了“战略经济对话”制度。	In recognition of the importance and complexity of the US-China economic relationship, in September 2006 President George W. Bush and President Hu Jintao created the “Strategic Economic Dialogue” between our countries.
2013年希腊总预算赤字预计仍将高达GDP的4.1 % — —与2010年相比进步很大，但远远称不上财政平衡。	The overall budget deficit is still predicted to be 4.1% of Greece’s GDP in 2013 – a substantial improvement compared to 2010 but still far from fiscal balance.
而我作为一个觉得中国崛起将对世界有利的人，则希望那些以为目前正是时候大展拳脚的中国官员们，能听一下邓小平的箴言。	As someone who believes that China’s rise should be good for the world, I hope that Deng’s wise advice will be heeded by those Chinese officials who seem to think that this is a good moment to start stamping their feet.
此人曾经在2000发表长篇讲话，反对那些将印度和中国这类国家转变成全球增长引擎，减少贫困，并且令边缘群体收益的自由化改革，这显示出他对某些基本问题缺乏判断。	His tirade in 2000 against the liberal reforms that have transformed countries like India and China into global growth engines, reduced poverty, and benefited marginalized groups shows that he lacked good judgment on fundamental issues.
最后，国际货币基金组织要实现它的全球性作用，其先决条件是每个成员国都可以在该组织中享有足够的代表权和发言权。	Finally, adequate representation and the right of each member to have a say in the Fund is a prerequisite of the legitimacy that the IMF needs to fulfill its global role.
科威特和阿曼虽然都是海湾合作委员会（还包括卡塔尔、巴林、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国）的成员，但却并未跟进沙特等国家的举措。	Kuwait and Oman have not followed suit, despite both being members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (which, in addition to Qatar, includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE).
此外中国面向互联性的狂飙还远未停止：在2011年中期，13亿中国人中只有36%能够上网 — — 这个数字相比韩国，日本和美国等地高达80%的渗透率来说还是偏低。	Moreover, China’s rush to connectivity is far from over. As of mid-2011, only 36% of its 1.3 billion people were connected – far short of the nearly 80% penetration rates seen in South Korea, Japan, and the United States.
近年来印度政界的执政障碍，国内断断续续的议会会议和争吵不休的联盟使这个问题显得比以往任何时候都更加重要。	The dysfunction of Indian politics in recent years, with its fractious coalitions and disrupted parliament sessions, has made that question seem more relevant than ever.
根据委员会的最坏情况想定，犯罪分子恶意行为及政府政治控制所带来的成本可能导致民众对互联网失去信任并减少对网络的使用。	In the Commission’s worst-case scenario, the costs imposed by the malicious actions of criminals and the political controls imposed by governments would cause people to lose trust in the Internet and reduce their use of it.
尽管去年8月欧洲央行通过承诺购买无限量短期政府债务稳定了市场，但激活欧洲央行的“直接货币交易”计划必须以持续财政紧缩为条件。	Although its pledge last August to purchase unlimited quantities of short-term government debt has calmed markets, activation of the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” program is conditional on continued fiscal retrenchment.
大多数人并不支付他们所消费的东西；他们以来别人来判断消费什么，而其价格并不像是影响常规商品那样影响他们的判断。	Most people do not pay for what they consume; they rely on others to judge what they should consume, and prices do not influence these judgments as they do with conventional commodities.
在这收入最高的10%的美国家庭中有90.6%持有有股票 — — 而其他90%的家庭中只有45%持有股票。	Fully 90.6% of US families in the highest decile of the income distribution owned stocks – double the 45% ownership share of the other 90%.
一项此类挑战 — — 梵蒂冈银行 — — 不下于奥吉厄斯的牛棚（Augean stables ） 。	One such challenge, the Vatican Bank, is equivalent to cleaning up the Augean stables.
于是，西巴尔干申请入盟的国家不得不与新的程序纠缠。 与2004年的大爆炸相比，如今的入盟程序更多地建立在政府间的基础上，常常沦为成员国自私的双边要挟物。	The western Balkan applicants have thus had to contend with a process that is now managed on a more intergovernmental basis than was the big bang of 2004, and which has, at times, been held hostage to member states’ selfish bilateral demands.
在加沙遭到长时间的封锁时，哈马斯领导人卡里德·马舍尔（Khalid Mashal）声称，因为老停火协议“没能解除对加沙的封锁 ” ， 所以没有订立新停火协议的必要。	With Gaza suffering under a lengthy siege, Hamas leader Khalid Mashal said that there was no point in a new truce, since the old one had “failed to lift the siege on Gaza.”
这笔收入可以用于管理气候行动的总体财政负担，也可以用来降低扭曲经济活动和妨碍增长的劳动和资本税或者用于在需要的时候降低赤字。	These revenues could be used to manage the overall fiscal burden of climate action, as well as to finance cuts in taxes on labor and capital that distort economic activity and harm growth, or to reduce deficits where needed.
新兴市场经济体在结构上仍非常容易受到短期传染风险影响，因此，少数国家的问题演变为整个资产类别融资条件吃紧只是时间问题。	With the emerging-market economies still structurally subject to short-term risks of contagion, it is usually just a matter of time until a few countries’ problems result in a tightening of financial conditions for the asset class as a whole.
认知科学研究第一次在道德哲学引发而来的理论观点基础之上使得解决有关道德起源和性质等古老的争论成为可能。	For the first time, research in the cognitive sciences, building on theoretical arguments emerging from moral philosophy, has made it possible to resolve the ancient dispute about the origin and nature of morality.
当被一起用餐的同伴发言打断其晚餐的时候，来自某北欧国家的一位高级政府官员甚至没有放下他的叉子，这位同伴指出现在很多西班牙人正在从垃圾桶里寻食。	One very senior government official of a northern European country did not even put down his fork when interrupted by an earnest dinner companion who pointed out that many Spaniards now eat out of garbage cans.
多数什叶派及其库尔德盟友拒绝了布什要求伊拉克政治家修改新的宪法草案，从而吸引心怀不满的逊尼派穆斯林参与的请求。	The majority Shia and their Kurdish allies rejected Bush’s plea to Iraqi politicians to modify the new draft constitution to attract disgruntled Sunni Arabs.
纽约—菲律宾的塔克洛班（Tacloban）成为近几年来因气候灾难而被毁的城市名单上的新名字。 这一名单包括新奥尔良、曼谷、莫斯科、纽约、北京、里约热内卢、太子港 … … 等等。	NEW YORK – Tacloban in the Philippines has now joined the growing list of cities – including New Orleans, Bangkok, Moscow, New York, Beijing, Rio de Janeiro, and Port-au-Prince, to name just a few – pummeled in recent years by climate catastrophes.
事实上，这将加剧人类面临的挑战：比如，气候变化带来的生态破坏和资源稀缺可能助长地区冲突和动荡，刺激更多的跨国移民。	In fact, it could even exacerbate those challenges: for example, the ecological destruction and resource scarcity brought about by climate change is likely to fuel conflict and instability, spurring ever-more migration.
随着两位学者发现针对旧有世俗体制的几起耸人听闻的法律案件证据纯属伪造，正义与发展党官员开始将所有司法领域的不当行为都推到居伦头上。	With two academics having already revealed that several sensational legal cases against the old secular establishment rested on fabricated evidence, AKP officials began to blame Gülen for all judicial improprieties.
4月初，日本央行宣布了最激进的债券购买计划，承诺在未来两年中向经济注入1.4万亿美元以实现2%的目标通胀率。	In early April, the BOJ announced plans to unleash the most aggressive bond-buying program of all, promising to inject $1.4 trillion into the economy over the next two years in order to meet an inflation target of 2%.
一个多世纪以前，法国地理学家埃莱斯·瑞克斯曾精准预言人们将一直需要“享受城市之美并同时拥有自然所滋养自由的双重可能性 ” 。	More than a century ago, the French geographer Élisée Reclus astutely predicted that people would always need “the dual possibility of gaining access to the delights of the city …and, at the same time, the freedom that is nourished by nature.”
Philippe Jorion和William Goetzmann的研究发现，39个拥有可靠股票价格数据、尽管没有红利数据的国家成为了二十世纪值得称道的一部���。	A study by Philippe Jorion and William Goetzmann found 39 countries with reliable stock price data – though not dividend data – for a good part of the twentieth century.
考虑到这些风险重新恢复了暴力，以色列的地区伙伴和国际行动者们应该懂得巴勒斯坦人不会偏离他们要建立一个独立国家的战略目标，这一点十分重要。	Given that this risks renewed violence, it is critical that Israel’s regional partners and international actors understand that Palestinians will not be diverted from their strategic objective of achieving an independent state.
他的工党领袖地位输给了巴拉克。 他加入了沙龙新成立的前进党（Kadima）和沙龙政府，并成为以色列右翼批评和抨击的对象。	He lost the leadership of Labor to Ehud Barak, joined Ariel Sharon’s new Kadima party and his government, and was the object of criticism and attacks by the Israeli right, who blamed him for the Oslo Accords.
这就引起了一种猜测：处决张成泽是对薄熙来被捕以及至今仍在进行的清洗其支持者（最近的目标是前���安力量主管周永康）行动的报复。	This has led to speculation that Chang’s execution was retaliation, endorsed by Shenyang, for Bo’s arrest and the ongoing purge of his supporters, including, most recently, Zhou Yongkang, the powerful former chief of internal security.

要在2030年前消灭作为卫生威胁的霍乱 — — 这是全球合作伙伴和世卫组织最新做出的承诺 — — 需要来自受霍乱影响的国家、技术合作伙伴和国际捐赠者的持续合作和致力。	Ending cholera as a health threat by 2030, as global partners and the WHO recently pledged, will require sustained collaboration and commitment from cholera-affected countries, technical partners, and international donors.
如果经济衰退的深度达到本次衰退实际深度的两倍，美国就会遭受约2万亿美元的损失，而全世界的损失总额更会四倍于此。	As Fed Vice Chairman Don Kohn said, ensuring that a few thousand investment bankers receive their just financial punishment is a non-starter when attempts to do so put the jobs of millions of Americans – and tens of millions outside the US – at risk.
2012年初，中国领导层开始推动更强大的私人所有权，股市的民营企业细分指数表现要好于国有企业细分指数，在上海和香港都是如此。	In early 2012, when the Chinese leadership moved toward stronger private ownership, stocks in the private-sector sub-index outperformed the state-owned sector sub-index on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges.
实际上，完成经济增长、社会凝聚和政治自由等高难度任务的新模型可能会在抓住了全球化外衣的某些国家中最先显现。	In fact, new models to square the circle of economic growth, social cohesion, and political liberty may be emerging in some of the countries that have grasped the mantle of globalization.

随着10个来自中、东、和南欧的国家在五月加入欧盟，欧盟在政治、经济和社会方面将会变得前所未有地多元化。	With the May accession of the ten central, eastern, and southern European candidate states, the European Union will be more politically, economically, and socially diverse than ever.
其他东欧前共产主义国家 — — 即立陶宛、乌克兰和匈牙利 — — 也偏好于牺牲和抵抗的民族主义叙事。	Other former communist countries in Eastern Europe – namely, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Hungary – have also come to favor a nationalist narrative of victimhood and resistance.
自以色列通过1967年六日战争占领东耶路撒冷以来，以色列政治阶层就一直在宣扬将耶路撒冷作为以色列的“统一的永久首都 ” ， 并且至今不愿放弃这一愿望。	Since Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War, the country’s political class has championed the city as Israel’s “united eternal capital” – a vision that they remain unwilling to abandon.
我们之所以支持他，是出于在任何聘用程序中都至关重要、但对世卫组织总干事这样的职位尤其重要的三个考量：候选者过去的成就、领导风格，及其所能带来的多样性。	Our endorsement is based on three considerations that are important in any hiring process, and especially for a position such as this: the candidate’s past achievements, leadership style, and the diversity that he or she brings to the table.
今日，北约26个联盟国的首脑在布鲁塞尔的北约总部齐聚一堂，以展现跨大西洋两岸无以伦比的团结精神，表达他们期待共同行动的决心。	Today, 26 NATO Heads of State and Government will meet at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. They are here to demonstrate a strong spirit of unity in the transatlantic community, a determination to look forward and take action together.
但是，在2009年的哥本哈根会议上，承诺形成全球协定的气候谈判各方食言了，因此，2015年12月的巴黎峰会几乎也必将沦为又一场灾难。	But, with climate negotiators promising to deliver the global agreement that they could not deliver in Copenhagen in 2009, the December 2015 summit in Paris is almost certain to be another debacle.
7月26日，欧洲央行行长德拉吉宣布欧洲央行准备“竭尽全力”捍卫欧元 ： “ 相信我 ， ” 他说 ， “ 这足以解决问题 。 ”	Speaking on July 26, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi announced that the ECB was ready to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro: “Believe me,” he said, “it will be enough.”
一切信息都将变得自由，而这对于基于控制知识的体制来说将构成生存威胁，包括那些原先试图将自己与外部世界隔绝的体制。	Information would become free, in all senses, and this would pose an existential threat to regimes based on the control of knowledge, including those that had previously tried to close themselves off from the outside world.
社会科学家应该继续拷问不平等对经济增长究竟是好是坏，也需要对包括收入中位数在内的影响增长变量进行更多的研究。	Social scientists should continue to ask whether inequality is good or bad for economic growth. More research is needed on the variables that affect growth, such as median income.
为交易所和证券监管机构设立标准的国际证券委员会组织（International Organization of Securities Commissions，IOSCO）也有人认得。	And the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which sets standards for exchanges and securities regulators, has name recognition in some quarters.
这些反映在人们的穿着风格上，反映在他们在公众场合的表现以及他们所运用的语言上的价值观已经不是人类生活的价值观。	These values – reflected in the way people dress, how they behave in public, and the language they speak – are not the values of human life.
而令财富测量进一步复杂化的事实是，正如马丁·费尔德斯坦近日所指出的那样，对于绝大多数家庭而言，财富的很大一部分都是以无法计算的未来社会收益的形式存在的。	Complicating wealth measurements further is the fact that, as Martin Feldstein recently pointed out, for the vast majority of households, a large proportion of wealth is in the form of unaccounted future social benefits.
几十年来，欧洲有一种集体愧疚，觉得应该为此前对犹太人所做的事感到羞愧，如今，人们终于可以带着幸灾乐祸的心理说，犹太人也可能是杀人犯。	After decades of feeling obliged to drop the collective European head in shame for what was done to the Jews, people can finally say with an element of glee that Jews can be murderers, too.
伦敦—很难将我对玛格丽特·撒切尔 — — 平凡但具有启发性 — — 的个人记忆从压倒性的历史判决分开。	LONDON – It is difficult to separate some of my personal memories of Margaret Thatcher – mundane but revealing – from the sweeping judgments of history.

监管机构关注的是衍生品合约的一个重要特征 — — 允许衍生品行业断然关闭与陷入金融困境的实体的交易。	Other creditors typically cannot do that; in a US bankruptcy, for example, they must first wait for a court to decide whether the debtor company can be restructured. Only then can they collect their debts.
美国人对阿布格莱布疟俘一幕的反应，以及紧随其后的美国人质尼古拉斯·伯格的野蛮斩首，清楚地显示了人们眼中的文明国家通往野蛮之路。	American reactions to the Abu Ghraib torture scenes, followed by the beheading of the American hostage Nicholas Berg, show clearly the route to barbarism in a supposedly civilized country.
还在把金融传染威胁视为王牌的希腊政客应该注意到希腊选举和欧洲央行的债券购买计划之间的巧合，并领会其中显而易见的联系。	Greek politicians who still see the threat of financial contagion as their trump card should note the coincidence of the Greek election and the ECB’s bond-buying program and draw the obvious conclusion.
但即便是资本市场在企业融资中扮演着更重要角色的英美两国，资产价格的膨胀也无力去鼓励消费者消费或企业投资。	But, even in the US and Britain, where capital markets play a much larger role in corporate finance, asset-price inflation did little to encourage consumers to spend or companies to invest.
在全球范围内，最极端的气候政策路径 — — 耗资数万亿美元 — — 将使生活在“水下”的人口数量，在仅比没有气候政策的情况下减少18 % 。	And globally, the most extreme climate policy pathway – costing literally thousands of trillions of dollars – will reduce the number of people living “underwater” by only 18% compared to a no-climate-policy scenario.
事实上，在他手上，这已经成为俄罗斯外交政策的固定特征，以欺骗、欺凌、暴力和对重建共产主义崩溃后分崩离析的帝国的渴望为其要素。	Indeed, he has made it a regular feature of Russian foreign policy, which is characterized by deceit, bullying, violence, and the desire to restore the empire that was dismembered after the collapse of communism.
冷战的两极主宰结构及其后的美国单极时代（即没有结盟国家试图制衡美国）已经让位给了更加复杂、更加相互依赖的多极世界。	The Cold War’s bipolar governance structures and a subsequent period of American unilateralism – to which the non-aligned states attempted to act as a counterbalance – have given way to a much more complex and interdependent multi-polar world.
还有NBA自己的明星球员罗恩·阿泰斯特（Ron Artest）曾因在2004赛季的一场比赛中冲上观众席与球迷扭打而遭停赛 — — 他如今将自己的名字改成爱·世界和平（Metta World Peace ） ， 或许是为了改过自新吧。	In the NBA itself, a star player, Ron Artest, was suspended for the remainder of the 2004 season after going into the stands and brawling with heckling fans during a game. (Artest has now changed his name to Metta World Peace, perhaps in response.)
事实上，在2003—2004年间，德国没有坚持欧盟的稳定和发展公约（Stability and Growth Pact ） ， 起了一个非常不好的带头作用。	Indeed, Germany set a disgraceful and damaging example when, back in 2003-2004, it undermined the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact by not adhering to it.
但大部分明智的经济学家都同意，美国贸易赤字是拜国内结构性经济因素所赐，特别是低迷的家庭储蓄、顽固的政府赤字，以及美元作为世界主要储备货币的地位。	But most sensible economists agree that America’s trade deficits are the result of domestic structural economic factors, especially low household savings, persistent government deficits, and the US dollar’s role as the world’s main reserve currency.
截止2025年，私人开支可能达到5.6万亿美元 — — 其中2.1万亿美元来自家庭部门，而其余3.5万亿美元则来自企业。	By 2025, private spending could reach $5.6 trillion – $2.1 trillion by households, and $3.5 trillion by businesses.
它常常从惊奇开始 — — 比如，转型电视真人秀明星的房地产大亨唐纳德·特朗普令人大跌眼镜地成为美国共和党总统提名代表。	It often begins with a surprise – for example, Donald Trump, the real-estate tycoon turned reality TV star, defies the odds to become the US Republican Party’s presumptive presidential nominee.
这意味着任何引起严重反对的退欧计划 — — 不管是来自强硬民族主义者还是来自亲欧保守党 — — 都可以用来触发新的公投。	This means that any Brexit plan that arouses serious opposition, either from hardline nationalists or from pro-European Tories, could be used to trigger a new referendum.
为了稳定债务比率并将其逐渐降低到低于GDP60%的安全区域内（意希两国都超过100 % ） ，基本预算大量盈余的状况必须持续许多年。	Substantial primary surpluses will be needed for many years in order to stabilize the debt ratio and gradually reduce it to the economic safety zone of less than 60% of GDP (Italy and Greece are over 100%).
对法律滥用的反应通常是小心翼翼或公告性质，反应者通常是个别国家或社会（如欧盟 ） ， 反应对象通常是具体的违反行为。	The response to legal abuses has often been timid or declaratory, carried out by individual countries or communities like the European Union in response to specific violations.
同样是房地产界亿万富翁的贝卢斯科尼甚至比特朗普更加离经叛道，而且同是操纵大众媒体的高手（从字面上看确实如此，因为意大利多数大众媒体都归贝卢斯科尼所有 ） 。	Silvio Berlusconi, another real-estate billionaire, who began his career as a crooner on a cruise ship, was even more outrageous than Trump, as well as a master of the mass media – literally so, as he owned most of it in his country.
有人认为这些是敏感和复���的问题，超出了大多数选民的理解，而且更多的民主将会要么造成民粹主义，要么是让人尴尬的大范围弃权。	There are those who argue that these are sensitive and complicated issues beyond most voters’ understanding, and that more democracy would result in either populism or embarrassingly widespread abstentions.
将赤裸的囚犯浸在水中，水温为5 C时可浸20分钟，10°C时可浸40分钟，15°C时最长可浸60分钟。 剥夺睡眠的时间不能超过180小时，但是在休息8小时后可以再来。	Dousing a naked detainee with water was to last 20 minutes if the water’s temperature measured 5 °C, 40 minutes at 10 °C, and up to 60 minutes at 15 °C.

25年来最严重的经济减速让预算赤字扩大到创纪录的水平，巴西总统罗塞夫被迫转向紧缩，包括削减失业救济的福利补贴。	With the most severe economic slowdown in 25 years expanding the budget deficit to record levels, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has been forced to turn to austerity, including cuts in unemployment and welfare benefits.
相反，只要2001年和2003年花费在减税计划中的一小部分钱，该体系基本能在未来75年保持根基稳定。	On the contrary, the system could almost surely be put on a solid footing for the next 75 years with a fraction of what was spent on the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.
因此，绝大多数转向左翼的民主党人都积极建议由政府提供全民医疗保险 （ “ 全民医保计划 ” ） 、大学教育免费以及由联邦保障工作岗位或基本收入。	Hence, most of the Democrats veering to the left are proposing universal government-provided health insurance (“Medicare for all”), tuition-free college, and a federal job guarantee or basic income.
然而在今年十月底，她最终为欧洲的未来勾勒了一个远景，并以此说服德国联邦议会同意拯救欧元的一揽子计划。	At the end of October, however, she finally articulated a vision of the future of Europe that persuaded the German Bundestag to agree to a package of measures to save the euro.
自从布什在一月底的国情咨文演讲以来，与伊朗相关的形势就一直在变化发展之中，而布什政府的措辞也日渐强硬。	Ever since Bush’s State of the Union address at the end of January, hardly a day has passed without something happening in connection with Iran or without the Bush administration’s ratcheting up its rhetoric.
但是这并不说明为什么这些更为贫穷的移民保持宗教信仰，因为如果他们想要以美国的方式成功的话，就应该很快“同化 ” 。	Yet this doesn’t explain why these poorer immigrants remain religious; wanting to succeed US-style, they should want to be quick to “assimilate.”
在内政方面，萨尔柯齐把重点放在了青年人身上，力求唤起他们的爱国热情，建立勤于工作和遵纪守法的价值观，这是一场反对革命的革命。	At home, Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young, issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline, a counter-revolutionary revolution.
如今，超过一半的中国人居住在城市，而1990年只有四分之一，到2035年，城市人口比例预计将达七成。	More than 50% of Chinese live in urban areas today, up from 25% in 1990, and the proportion is expected to reach 70% by 2035.

这个组织应该利用团队的压力来对其成员国是否履行国际义务而施加影响，同时，为了提高决策的权威性，成员国还要有一些惩处措施。 例如对违约的国家实行集体的经济制裁等。	But, as confidence in the group’s decision-making – and in the impartiality of the secretariat – improves, members might give it some teeth, such as the ability to impose collective economic sanctions on recalcitrant members.
很显然，某些文化有其特有的表达方式和说话语气，因此Digital Mirror也分析其测量值出现的相对和绝对频率。	Obviously, some cultures have their own jargon and tone, so Digital Mirror looks at the relative as well as absolute frequency of the values that it measures.
气候中性是将全球变暖保持在2℃以下的必要条件；要实现这一目标，我们必须将排放减少到大自然可以轻易地充分吸收的程度。	Climate neutrality is necessary to keep global warming below 2°C; to reach it, we must reduce emissions to the point that they can be fully and easily absorbed by nature.
而实际上，正是台湾的资本和知识建立起了中国的高科技工业，而目前大概有超过50万台湾人在上海附近一个复制新竹工业园（台湾的矽谷）模式的工业园区工作和生活着。	Indeed, Taiwanese capital and know-how built much of China’s hi-tech industries, and well over a half-million Taiwanese live and work near Shanghai in a virtual replica of Hsin Chu, Taiwan’s Silicon Valley.

激进左翼联盟领导人阿莱克斯•齐普拉斯一针见血地指出 ， “ 内部贬值 ” ， 即削减工资和物价（来缩小与欧元区其他国家之间的竞争力差距 ） ， 是失败的举措。	Alexis Tsipras, the head of the Coalition of the Radical Left has a valid point: “internal devaluation” – cutting wages and prices – is failing as a strategy.
全球智能手机保有量将在2025年达到80亿，在线人才市场也因此拥有向新区域和新经济部门拓展的巨大空间。	With global smartphone subscriptions set to reach eight billion by 2025, online talent platforms have enormous room to expand into new regions and sectors.

其次，由于大部分出口国同时也进口用美元计价的中间投入品，汇率波动对于它们的成本影响有限，因此对它们更改美元价格的刺激也有限。	Second, because most exporters also import intermediate inputs that are priced in dollars, exchange-rate fluctuations have a limited impact on their costs and thus on their incentive to change dollar prices.
全世界每年在能源和基础设施上花费近7万亿美元；而我们当前的研究和开发工作还不足以解决气候变化的难题。	The world spends nearly $7 trillion a year on energy and its infrastructure; yet our current research and development efforts are not up to meeting the challenge of climate change.
但是，解决方案并不在于用人民币取代美元，而在于强化世界唯一的全球货币 — — IMF的特别提款权（Special Drawing Rights，SDR）的作用。	The solution, however, lies not in replacing the dollar with the renminbi, but in strengthening the role of the world’s only truly global currency: the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights.
发自伦敦 — — 自十九世纪初手工纺织工人摧毁威胁自身生计的机械织机以来，关于自动化的争论总会让人联想关于未来就业的黯淡情景。	LONDON – Ever since early-nineteenth-century textile workers destroyed the mechanical looms that threatened their livelihoods, debates over automation have conjured gloom-and-doom scenarios about the future of work.
对于一个在去年9月选举之前甚至连议会代表权都没资格获取的党派来说，这样一个重要位置原本是想都不敢想的。	For a party that did not even qualify for parliamentary representation until last September’s election, such a prominent position was beyond their wildest dreams.
因此将伊朗描绘成威胁、进而寻求破坏其地区和全球信誉的行为应该立刻停止 — — 这关系到该地区甚至全世界的和平与宁静。	So those who portray Iran as a threat and thus seek to undermine its regional and global credibility should cease – in the interest of peace and tranquility in the region and beyond.
埃伦·约翰逊·瑟利夫当选利比里亚总统标志着女性在非洲大陆所取得的进步，埃伦是受到推举管理非洲国家的首位女性。	Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf’s election as President of Liberia, the first women elected to run an African country, was symbolic of the progress of women across the continent.
而随着贷款不断地转移到“影子”中，金融市场的价格发现功能受到了严重制约，以至于许多资产现在都表现出价值高估。	And as lending has continued to migrate further into the “shadows,” price discovery in financial markets has become severely compromised, to the point that many assets now seem to be overvalued.
有一些绝对一流的人才可以胜任世行行长这一工作。 他们已经展示了他们的智力、人品、政治及管理技能以及对经济发展的控制能力。	There are some absolutely first-rate individuals who could step into the job, people who have shown their command of economic development, their intellect and personal integrity, and their political and managerial skills.
停电越来越频繁、时间越来越长，这表明这个正在经受大规模失业、普遍的排斥感和大量贫困的国家境况还会继续恶化。	More frequent and longer-lasting power outages foretell worse to come in an economy already struggling with mass unemployment, widespread exclusion, and deep pockets of poverty.
在随后的战斗中，美国夺取了关塔那摩，将之作为海军基地，并主张（根据现在闻名天下的普拉特修正案）拥有干涉古巴的未来权利。	In the fighting that ensued, the US grabbed Guantánamo as a naval base and asserted (in the now infamous Platt Amendment) a future right to intervene in Cuba.
我的研究团队估算如能让劳动力参与率差距减小一半 — — 从32个百分点下降为16个百分点 — — 受影响国家的GDP在第一年就能增加15 % ， 全球GDP可以增加4万亿美元。	My research team estimates that if we cut the labor-force participation gap by just half – from 32 percentage points to 16% – GDP in the affected countries would increase by 15% in the first year alone, adding $4 trillion to global GDP.
去年，沙特国王阿卜杜拉由于担心什叶派的扩张而在其国家安全委员会首领班达尔本亲王的劝说下与以色列协调政策，来钳制伊朗日益增加的影响力。	Last year, Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, worried by Shi’a expansionism, was persuaded by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the head of his National Security Council, to coordinate policy with Israel to counter Iran’s growing influence.
布什苦苦等候了几个礼拜，才等来了这次积极的进展。 这使他得以提出在2006年底之前把驻伊美军从原来的133，000人减至100，000人。	Bush waited weeks for a positive development that would allow him to suggest he can reduce troop levels in Iraq from 133,000 to 100,000 by the end of 2006.
它的治理体系依据这样一种信仰，即完整的谈判、分歧、反馈和妥协进程而非自上而下未经挑战的决策是制定明智、公平和有效决策的最佳途径。	Its system of governance rests on the belief that an integrated process of bargaining, disagreement, reflection, and compromise – not top-down unchallenged decision-making – is the most effective route to wise, fair, and successful policymaking.
我坚信欧盟的新成员不会忘记自己曾经有过的极权主义和以非暴力方式对抗罪恶的经历，而他们在欧盟团体内的处事方式会体现出他们的上述经历。	I firmly believe that the new members of the EU will not forget their experience of totalitarianism and non-violent opposition to evil, and that that experience will be reflected in how they behave in EU bodies.
推特、脸谱和洽社交媒体也确实在2009年的伊朗、2011年的阿拉伯世界和2013—2014年乌克兰的群众起义中扮演了关键角色。	And Twitter, Facebook, and other social media did indeed play a key role in popular uprisings in Iran in 2009, in the Arab world in 2011, and in Ukraine in 2013-2014.
但美国及其盟国很快就拒绝了这项协议，因为它们认为伊朗是在采取伎俩减弱国际社会对其实施额外制裁的增长势头。	But the US and its allies quickly rejected the agreement as an Iranian ploy designed to halt the growing momentum for additional sanctions.
纽约 — — 全球金融市场正在经历的大动荡和股价大修正表明，大多数发达经济体正站在双底衰退的悬崖边上。	NEW YORK – The massive volatility and sharp equity-price correction now hitting global financial markets signal that most advanced economies are on the brink of a double-dip recession.
但虽然当前情况属于技术性通货紧缩 — — 也就是，持续的价格水平下降，并可能在就业或其他合同上体现出来 — — 但并非结构性通缩。	But while what is happening is technically deflation – that is, sustained price-level decreases that may be reflected in employment or other contracts – it is not structural deflation.
美联储主席珍妮特·耶伦反复说，即将到来的一连串升息将比此前的货币周期缓慢得多，并预测利率的峰值也要更低。	Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, has repeatedly said that the impending sequence of rate hikes will be much slower than previous monetary cycles, and predicts that it will end at a lower peak level.
这一协定规定了对以往各种袭击的受害者的赔偿程序，赔偿范围涵盖了从1988年泛美103航班在苏格兰小镇洛克比遇袭到1986年美国对利比亚城市的黎波里和班加西的空袭的受害者。	The agreement provides a process for compensating the victims of attacks ranging from the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, to the US air strikes on Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986.
想想韩国科学家黄禹锡吧，他声称已从他克隆的人体胚胎中提取干细胞，结果却是这项研究却根本就是欺世盗名。	Consider the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk, whose claim to have extracted stem cells from human embryos that he cloned turned out to be based on phony research.
我们需要新的思维来应对这些大规模且系统性的变革需要，同时也需要把中国和印度这样的大国整合进入现代世界。	New thinking is required to manage these massive and systemic changes, as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world.
为了寻求战略纵深以对抗世仇印度，巴基斯坦在沙特阿拉伯的支持下，以阿富汗难民营好战的宗教学生为班底拉起一支队伍 — — 由巴基斯坦三军情报局（ISI）一手组建和武装起来的“塔利班 ” 。	Supported by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan sought strategic depth against its arch-enemy India with the help of militant religious students from Afghan refugee camps. These “Taliban” were created and equipped by the Pakistani secret service, the ISI.
今年生效的美国平价医疗法案（Affordable Care Act）中包括了政府充当催化剂这一思想的后续衍生品，如用奖金激励改善效果、降低成本的新医疗体系。	The United States’ Affordable Care Act, which entered into force this year, contains further variants on the idea of government as a catalyst, including incentives to reward health-care systems that improve outcomes and reduce costs.
毒品在墨西哥的使用是否在向更广大的人群扩散，还不明确：毒品成瘾增长的速度惊人具有误导性，因为成瘾的数字是从极低的基数开始的。	It is unclear that drug use in Mexico is extending more widely into the population: alarming rates of addiction growth are misleading, because addiction starts from an extremely low base.
尽管如此，人们当时仍然就遵守游戏规则达成了默契 — — 具体而言就是遵守世贸组织规则 — — 而美国最终也做到了。	Still, there was an implicit understanding that everybody would abide by the rules of the game – specifically, the rules of the World Trade Organization – and the US ultimately did.
假如你看到了自己在Digital Mirror中的分析结果（显然没有人是完美的 ） ， 你会对自己的行为加以改善吗？	Once you see your own digital reflection, will you improve your behavior? (Surely you are not already perfect?)
事实上，西方早期城市化大都以与自然相悖的发展模式为特色，连接城市的不是绿地和公园，而是无穷无尽的不透水的道路。	In fact, most early urbanization in the West was characterized by development patterns that crashed against nature, connected not by green spaces and parks, but rather by endless ribbons of impervious pavement.
在提高了最低工资之后，下一步是扩大EITC，放松其所得和合规标准，提高其规模，使其适用于阶段薪酬而不是年度总额。	After raising the minimum wage, the next step is to expand the EITC, by broadening its income and eligibility criteria, increasing its size, and making it available in periodic payments instead of an annual lump sum.
如果人们觉得受到威胁或相信某项事业的正确，国内的公众舆论会支持使用武力。 但美国对统治其它国家的兴趣的确微乎其微。	Domestic public opinion will support the use of force if people feel threatened or believe that the cause is just, but Americans have little interest in ruling over other nations.
"可以肯定，多数税收会带来沉重的""额外负担 "" 。 税收成本远较收入价值为高，因为潜在的纳税者会想出种种办法来进行逃避。"	"To be sure, most taxes entail heavy ""excess burdens"": the cost is significantly greater than the value of the revenue raised because of potential taxpayers' myriad attempts at evasion and avoidance."
长期以来沙特王国对统治合法性的传统解释取决于统治者是否正确实施了伊斯兰律法，而臣民则应当在伊斯兰教法的限制下服从其统治。	The Kingdom’s traditional interpretation of Islam construes political legitimacy in terms of a ruler’s proper application of Islamic law. In return, his subjects owe him obedience within the constraints of Sharia religious law.
经济增长开始放缓也是常态；毕竟，高速增长需要创造性破坏；而因为受到破坏的将是财阀的财富，因此他们不可能鼓励创造性破坏。	And it is normal for economic growth to be slow; rapid growth, after all, requires creative destruction; and, because what would be destroyed would be the plutocrats’ wealth, they are unlikely to encourage it.
尼泊尔早先试验进行民主制度都不成功。 五十年代和九十年代经过民主选举上台的政府被漫长的专制统治悄无声息地取而代之。	Nepal’s earlier experiments with democratic governance were not very successful; democratically elected governments (in the late 1950’s and the 1990’s) were unceremoniously replaced by prolonged autocratic rule.
几乎所有环境援助 — — 根据经合组织的数据，总量达到了215亿美元左右 — — 都被用在了气候变化上。	Almost all environmental aid – about $21.5 billion, according to the OECD – is spent on climate change.
始于2007年的互换安排最初是临时性措施，在美联储、欧洲央行和瑞士国民银行间建立了联系，但每逢新危机动摇市场，这一安排就会扩大一次。	Originally created as a temporary fix in 2007, the swap lines established at that time connecting the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank have been extended each time a new crisis has unsettled the markets.
不断深入的亚洲各经济体贸易金融一体化让它们越来越容易受到中国的增长冲击，其中大宗商品出口商和资本货物尤其脆弱。	Asian economies’ deepening trade and financial integration has left them increasingly vulnerable to growth shocks from China, with exporters of commodities and capital goods especially vulnerable.
为了扭转这一趋势，医疗保健行业必须与所有利益相关方合作保持医疗保健系统在财政方面的可持续性，使它们能更好地应对不断增长的护理需求。	To reverse this trend, the health-care industry must work with all stakeholders to support the financial sustainability of health-care systems, so that they can better handle the growing demand for care.
20世纪70年代、2002—2004年以及2007—2008年，真实（经通胀调整的）利率的下降伴随着真实大宗商品价格的上升；20世纪80年代美国真实利率的急剧上升导致大宗商品美元价格暴跌。	Falling real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates in the 1970s, 2002-2004, and 2007-2008 were accompanied by rising real commodity prices; sharp increases in US real interest rates in the 1980s sent dollar commodity prices tumbling.
但是如果仔细看一看美国国会预算办公室的预计就会发现，我们的社会老龄化只不过是问题的一部分，而且还不是较大的部分。	But a careful look at the projections by, say, the US Congressional Budget Office, show that the aging of our societies is only a part of the problem, and not the larger part.
事实上，倘若独裁政府能够有效地箝制媒体的言论，他们甚至可以允许（相对）自由的选举，就像普京时代的俄罗斯那样。	Indeed, provided they can sufficiently muzzle the media they can even allow (relatively) free elections, as in Putin’s Russia.
但是，在许多地区，东北大海啸漫过甚至摧毁了这些保护设施 — — 包括本州岛北部福岛第一核电站的海塘。	But, in many areas, the Tohoku tsunami overflowed and even destroyed these protective structures – including the seawall at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in northern Honshu.
而 当许多新兴市场经济体都像那些学生一样自暴自弃的时候，也许国际货币基金组织（IMF）也该和这位女教师一样将剧本翻到新的一页了。	At a time when many emerging-market economies are as discouraged as Pfeiffer’s students, perhaps the International Monetary Fund should take a page out of her playbook.
如果伦齐失败 — — 目前这种可能性越来越大 — — 反欧元的五星运动（Five Star Movement，在最近的市政选举中表现出色）可能早在明年上台掌权。	If Renzi fails – as is increasingly possible – the anti-euro Five Star Movement (which recently did well in municipal elections) could come to power as early as next year.
但当第十一章立足于保存破产公司的现有价值之时，国际救助机制的目标则恰恰相反，是保存那些破产金融机构的相对方的现有价值。	But, while the goal of Chapter 11 is to save the ongoing value of a firm, the goal of the international resolution mechanism should be to preserve the ongoing value of the counterparties of insolvent financial institutions.
在这一事件中，列奇做了任何人都可能为韦尔比做的事，因为韦尔比已经瘫痪，无法自己拒绝这种成为负担的医疗手段。	On this view, Riccio was doing what anyone should have been prepared to do for Welby, who was paralyzed and unable to implement his refusal of a burdensome medical treatment.
伦齐不仅需要获得已经在公投议题中陷入严重分裂的本党派的支持，还需要争取已经对政治大失所望的意大利选民的支持。	Renzi will need the support not just of his own party, which is deeply divided over the referendum, but also of an Italian electorate that has grown disillusioned with politics in general.
改革监管法规应该遵循以下三个原则，首先，也是最重要的一点是，金融监管机构必须承担起责任，在市场繁荣的时候防止资产泡沫的出现。	Three principles should guide reform. First and foremost, financial authorities must accept responsibility for preventing asset bubbles from growing too big.
纽约 — — “天安门大屠杀”整整二十年后，中华人民共和国却鲜有年轻人了解当时发生的状况，思之的确令人齿冷。	NEW YORK – It is a chilling thought that exactly twenty years after the “Tiananmen Massacre” few young citizens of the People’s Republic of China have much idea of what happened on that occasion.
除此之外，追求欧元国身份还能带来正面的伴随效果，会增强金融市场参与者之间的统合预期，并将其转化为降低投资者的风险利差。	Moreover, a commitment to pursue euro membership will have positive spillover effects. It will reinforce convergence expectations among financial market participants, which will translate into lower risk premia for investors.
尽管沙龙缺席，前进党仍然在民意调查中领先。 最新的调查显示，该党将获得以色列议会120个席位中的44个，工党21个，而内塔尼亚胡领导的右翼残余的利库德党有14个席位。	Despite Sharon's absence, Kadima maintains its lead in public opinion polls – the most recent gave it 44 of the Knesset’s 120 seats, compared to 21 for Labor and 14 for the right-wing rump-Likud, under Binyamin Netanyahu.
此举还带来了另一个令人担忧的后果：由于马利基同时也是伊朗心目中的总理人选，故美国的外交政策实际上进一步提升了伊朗在伊拉克的地位。	One unsettling consequence of US diplomacy is that it has reinforced Iran’s role in Iraq, because Maliki is Iran’s preferred candidate for Prime Minister.
第二天，联邦法官驳回了他的任命，申诉和反诉纷至沓来，数百万人走上街头要求弹劾总统，没人确定谁掌控了局面。	The next day, a federal judge blocks his appointment, claims and counterclaims are filed before the courts, millions take to the streets demanding the president’s impeachment, and no one is quite certain who is in charge.
但是，在保护弱势者、抵抗社会不公加剧势头方面，这种“文化差异的全球化消除”也许恰恰创造了一个机会，令我们可以把各个传统中的精华部分结合起来。	But, when it comes to the protection of the weakest and the struggle against rising social injustice, perhaps “global deculturation” creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions.
更糟糕的是，2008年金融危机爆发后，发达国家的停滞不前的增长和高失业助长了采取更多保护主义措施的要求。	Worse, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, sluggish growth and high unemployment in developed countries have fueled demands for more protectionism.
同样，脸书和谷歌主宰了数字广告市场，但它们从中获得的利润允许其提供表面上免费的电邮和社会媒体服务来使消费者受益。	Likewise, Facebook and Google dominate the digital advertising market, but their profits allow them to offer ostensibly free email and social-media services that benefit consumers.
但即使它们不这么做，让外国出口商难以赚到美元的措施也会造成美元短缺，在浮动汇率制度下，这会自动刺激美元升值。	But even if they don’t, measures that make it harder for foreign exporters to earn dollars will create a dollar scarcity, which, in an environment of floating exchange rates, will automatically boost the greenback’s value.
我们强调社会被两股政治裂痕所割裂：将少数人和种族、宗教或意识形态多数人分开的身份裂痕；以及将富人和其他人分开的财富差距。	We emphasize that societies are divided by two potential cleavages: an identity split that separates a minority from the ethnic, religious, or ideological majority, and a wealth gap that pits the rich against the rest of society.
以巴西为例，我们的Vale Mais Saúde医疗计划利用这种方法来治疗慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD ） ， 有预测认为这种潜在的致命肺病到2030年可能成为世界第三大杀手。	In Brazil, for example, our Vale Mais Saúde program uses this approach to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a potentially fatal lung condition forecast to be the world’s third biggest killer by 2030.
理由很简单，所有经济体内部都有贷款者和存款者，而借款成本（或者储蓄回报）的变动会对他们造成不一样的影响。	The argument is simple: All economies have both borrowers and savers, and changes in the cost of borrowing (or the return to saving) affect them differently.
但是，我们也无法接受这样一种局面，那就是，大量资源用于国内凝聚，而欧洲范围的凝聚则远远地被抛在后面。	But neither can we accept a situation in which vast resources are spent on national cohesion, while European cohesion lags so woefully behind.
东盟部长会议自召开45年里来首次无法在联合公报上达成共识，表面上是因为现任东盟主席国柬埔寨不希望在公报中谈及南中国海的双边争端。	For the first time in 45 years, the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) failed to agree to a joint communiqué, ostensibly because ASEAN’s current chair, Cambodia, did not want the communiqué to refer to bilateral disputes in the South China Sea.
谁会预测在不到十年的时间里，一位名不见经传的科西嘉士兵会率领法军来到尼罗河沿岸，或是拿破仑战争会横扫欧洲，直到1815年才结束？	Who would have predicted that within a decade, an obscure Corsican soldier would lead French armies to the banks of the Nile, or that the Napoleonic Wars would disrupt Europe until 1815?
习近平认为政府的合法性在很大程度上是一个包含持续传递的多项价值观，经济和社会进步，以及严格承诺将公共利益放在治理形式之上的集合。	Xi believes that a government’s legitimacy is mainly a function of consistently delivered values, together with economic and social progress, with strict commitment to the public interest taking precedence over the form of governance.
削减赤字的步伐必须放缓，特别是在西班牙，因为产量在短期内由需求决定，而除非对未来的信心在一定程度上得以恢复，否则私人需求就无法替代公共需求。	The pace of deficit reduction must be slowed, particularly in Spain, because output is determined in the short run by demand, and private demand cannot replace public demand until a degree of faith in the future is restored.
鉴于这种情况，欧洲可能突然成为新兴国家一面完全不同的镜子，暴露出他们自身存在的结构性缺陷，甚至导致这些缺陷进一步加剧。	In that case, Europe could suddenly become a very different mirror for emerging countries, revealing, if not accentuating, their own structural weaknesses.
另一方面的危险是 ， “ 发展回合”的完成没能达到它引起的高预期，从而进一步在长期内侵蚀了全球贸易规则的正当性。	On the other side is the danger that a completed “development round” will fail to live up to the high expectations that it has spawned, further eroding the legitimacy of global trade rules over the longer run.
特朗普政府的计划的细节仍有待确定，但官员极有可能采取放松杠杆上限的方向（从而允许银行借入相对于股本更多的资金 ） 。	The details of the Trump administration’s plans remain to be determined, but officials will most likely push in the direction of relaxing limits on leverage (thereby allowing banks to borrow more relative to equity).
他认为，美国民主的最大危险是多数人的暴政，美国式生活中令人窒息的思想顺从，令人压抑的少数派观点和异见。	The biggest danger to US democracy, he believed, was the tyranny of the majority, the suffocating intellectual conformity of American life, the stifling of minority opinion and dissent.
说到底，如果说当前趋势发展利用了什么神话的话，那就是将央行行长视为技术官僚，能够超然于他们所处时代的政治和意识形态之外。	The bottom line is that if there is one myth that recent developments have exploded it is probably the one that sees central bankers as technocrats, hovering independently over the politics and ideologies of their time.
作为二战后最伟大的美国外交官之一的乔治·凯南曾经写道,西方社会在50年来犯得最大的一个错误就是，在前苏联共产政权倒台之后，北约还继续东扩。	George Kennan, one of the greatest American diplomats of the post-war years, once wrote that the Western world was committing its biggest mistake in 50 years time by expanding NATO after Soviet communism collapsed.
他们关注的焦点是终止器官走私，却忽视了一条经过时间验证的真理：试图消灭地下违法市场不是让它们转入更地下，就是使得腐败在其他地方再次出现。	They�focus on ending organ trafficking but ignore the time-tested truth that trying to stamp out illicit markets either drives them further underground or causes corruption to�reappear elsewhere.
对于那些渴望稳定和民主的伊拉克人而言，好消息是一种涣散的、无组织和无政府状态的叛乱不可能取得传统意义上取代现政府并建立新政权的“胜利 ” 。	The good news for those who desire stability and democracy in Iraq is that an amorphous, disorganized, and nihilistic insurgency cannot “win” in the traditional sense of replacing the government and forming a new regime.
实际上，今日中东地区的内部动态主要由三个国家推动，其中哪一个都不是阿拉伯国家： 这三个国家是以色列、伊朗，而且土耳其的影响越来越大。	Indeed, intra-regional dynamics in the Middle East today are driven by three states, none of which is Arab: Israel, Iran, and, increasingly, Turkey.
对除此之外的发展中世界而言，真正的大患不是需求不足；而是需要维持高生产率增长率，以使它们可以赶超发达经济体。	For the rest of the developing world, the real worry is not a shortfall of demand; it is the need to sustain high rates of productivity growth so that they can catch up with the advanced economies.
但即使是英国首相梅杰这样平步青云的人物，也是在担任了青少年社会服务部长、外交大臣、财政大臣之后，才问鼎首相宝座。	But even a figure like British Prime Minister John Major, who was fast-tracked to the top, served as a junior social services minister, foreign secretary, and chancellor of the exchequer before taking over the premiership.
比方说，正像很多国家上代人曾在汽车安全带问题上开展过的那样，应当在立法的同时开展公众安全运动，解释并宣传两步验证法则。	For example, just as many countries did with car seatbelts a generation ago, a public-safety campaign could be paired with legislation to explain and promote two-step verification.
虽然去年百万穆斯林移民入境总体而言并未损害经济 — — 德国经济仍然实现了充分就业 — — 但仍有很多人反对默克尔总理提出的建设文化更加多元的新德国的目标。	Though the arrival of a million largely Muslim immigrants last year has not hurt the economy – which remains at full employment – many people are rejecting Chancellor Angela Merkel’s vision of a new, more multicultural Germany.
这些城市包括巴西利亚（20世纪50年代 ） 、 堪培拉（20世纪10年代 ） 、 伊斯兰堡(20世纪60年代 ) ， 新德里（20世纪60年代）和华盛顿（20世纪50年代 ） 。	These include Brasilia (1950’s), Canberra (1910’s), Islamabad (1960’s), New Delhi (1910’s), and Washington DC (1790’s). In each of these cases, a planner built the whole city infrastructure to make it a cohesive, attractive place.
沙特阿拉伯前石油部长、OPEC的缔造者之一，Sheikh Yamani曾说 ： “ 石器时代的结束并不是因为缺少石头；石油时代的结束也不会是因为缺少石油 。 ”	Sheikh Yamani, Saudi Arabia’s former oil minister and a founding architect of OPEC, once said, “The stone age came to an end not for a lack of stones, and the oil age will end, but not for a lack of oil.”
但最近在布鲁塞尔峰会上做出的决策依然信心不足，这不仅源自于缺乏信任或者在英国否决票上的小题大做，还包括对本次危机明显缺乏干涉手段的状况。	And yet confidence in the recent decisions taken in Brussels remains low, owing not only to dissipated trust and the fuss about the British veto, but also to the apparent absence of measures to intervene in the current crisis.
最初从反对政府将伊斯坦布尔市中心一座小公园拆毁改建俗气购物中心开始的群众集会活动迅速演变为一场价值观的碰撞。	What began as a rally against official plans to raze a small park in the center of Istanbul to make way for a kitschy shopping mall quickly evolved into a conflict of values.
比如，欧洲和世界的未来状态充满了不确定性，争论扩张或TTIP似乎毫无意义 — — 甚至更加糟糕，因为即使开放这些讨论也必然正中欧洲怀疑派下怀。	For example, given so much uncertainty about the future state of Europe and the world, debating enlargement or the TTIP seems pointless – or worse, because even opening such discussions is certain to play into the hands of Euroskeptics.
在一些人看来，英国甚至先于意大利这样有 “亲欧洲”传统的国家签署这项条约，只能进一步说明这项条约在加速欧洲的统一步伐方面缺乏新鲜而大胆的创意。	For some, the fact that the United Kingdom might ratify it even earlier than traditionally “pro-European” countries like Italy merely underscores the Treaty’s lack of new and bold initiatives to accelerate European unification.
一战后，英国陆军元帅阿奇博尔德·韦维尔颇有预见性地指出 ， “ 在‘以战争结束战争’后，胜利者似乎成功地在巴黎达到了‘以和平结束和平的目的 ’ ” 。	After World War I, the British field marshal Archibald Wavell presciently observed that, “After ‘the war to end war,’” the victors “seem to have been pretty successful in Paris at making a ‘Peace to end Peace.’”
2011年，大商人沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）就表明资本利得税并不会阻止投资者进行投资，也不会破坏创造就业机会。	In 2011, the businessman Warren Buffett pointed out that capital gains taxes do not stop investors from making investments, nor do they undermine job creation.
换言之，新一轮阶级分化无关贫富差异，而更多倾向于受过教育的都市精英和没那么世故、灵活，并且在各方面关系也没那��丰富的乡下人的区别。	In other words, the new class divisions run less between the rich and the poor than between educated metropolitan elites and less sophisticated, less flexible, and, in every sense, less connected provincials.
但此次重启基本上是由奥巴马和梅德韦杰夫的个人关系推动的。 在2012年普京开始其第三个任期前，俄罗斯总统是梅德韦杰夫。	But this reset was largely facilitated by the personal ties between Obama and Dmitri Medvedev, who served as President for four years before Putin returned in 2012 for a third term.
2011年下半年，有证据表明新兴经济体 — — 它们在抵御2008年爆发的金融危机中表现略好 — — 随着欧元区危机的深入而受到了拖累。	By the second half of 2011, it was evident that emerging economies, which had weathered the financial crisis that began in 2008 moderately well, were taking on water as the eurozone crisis deepened.
总体而言，学校教育和计划生育可以在未来30年减少1200亿吨的二氧化碳排放量，因为人口的减少将减轻资源消耗的压力。	Taken together, schooling and family planning could translate into a 120-gigaton reduction in carbon dioxide emissions over the next three decades, as fewer people consumed fewer resources.
这些公司想打入美国市场并利用墨西哥湾沿岸港口扩大出口业务，但拱心石XL输油管道计划并不是他们手上唯一的方案。	They want to access the American market and use Gulf Coast ports to export more widely, but Keystone XL is not their only option.
在欧元启用后十年的今天，我们必须效法其创始人，以团结合作和雄心勃勃的精神，化危机为机遇，从而夯实欧洲“经济和货币联盟”的基石。	A decade after the euro’s introduction, we must follow the example of its founders and turn crisis into opportunity by uniting in a spirit of cooperation and ambition – and thereby reinforce the EMU’s foundations.
你还可以否认杀手与恐怖组织有涉；伊斯兰国直到杀手本人在行凶途中宣布效忠、从而给他的行动贴上了标签后才宣布对此事件负责。	One can also dismiss the killer’s connection to terror groups; the Islamic State (ISIS) did not own the incident until after the killer himself, in the midst of the attack, pledged his allegiance and thus put a label on his actions.
社会民主主义很容易转变为民粹主义，反对任何公共支出的削减甚至去监管化（这样做本可以刺激生产率 ） ， 这样的例子在历史上屡见不鲜。	All too often, social democracy has amounted to populism, opposing any cuts in public expenditures and even deregulation, which would have enhanced productivity.
我们非常需要药理创新的结核病药品，不仅仅用来治疗多充抗药性结核病，也用来缩短药物敏感性结核病的治���时间。	New TB drugs with novel mechanisms of action are badly needed, not only to treat multi-drug resistant TB, but also to shorten the treatment time for drug-sensitive TB.
你也许会认为，在相当一段长的时间里，国际合作将非常有限，增长将十分缓慢，失业率将保持高位，还会出现极端私有化啊，因为各国无力为巨大的投资需要提供融资。	One might have expected a long period of limited international cooperation, slow growth, high unemployment, and extreme privation, owing to countries’ limited capacity to finance their huge investment needs.
据报那些转帐文件都被照常抹掉类似汇款目的地等关键细节，因此也更难对这类交易进行调查并难以搜集到违规证据。	The transfer documentation reportedly was regularly stripped of key details such as the destination of wire transfers, so that the transaction would be harder to investigate and less likely to provide evidence of malfeasance.
丰裕人群更能获得有益于健康的环境，如提供优质教育的维护良好的学校、高质量的住房、稳定的有安全保障的工作。	Affluent people have better access to health-promoting environments, such as well-maintained schools that offer a good education, high-quality housing, and stable jobs in secure, safe settings.
各国政府已经在推广养老、健康以及失业保险上的个人储蓄账户；通常，它们要么是强制性的，要么是通过税收优惠进行补贴的。	Governments have been promoting individual savings accounts for pensions, health, and unemployment insurance; often, these are either mandatory or subsidized through tax incentives.
按照英国著名战略学家劳伦斯·弗里德曼的说法，在凸显美国不同于“以往主导大国”的各项特色中，最重要的是美国的实力基础是联盟而非殖民 。 ”	Among the features that distinguish the US from “the dominant great powers of the past,” according to the distinguished British strategist Lawrence Freedman, is that “American power is based on alliances rather than colonies.”
伊朗认为它是国际双重标准的受害者 — — 国际社会接受了巴基斯坦和印度的核地位，更不要提以色列了 — — 而这只会增强其受到歧视的感觉以及继续其野心的决心。	Iran believes that it is the victim of an international double standard – acceptance of Pakistan’s and India’s nuclear status, not to mention Israel’s – which only fuels its sense of discrimination and its resolve to pursue its ambitions.
伦敦—在《为什么你打桥牌赢不了 》 （ Why You Lose at Bridge，这是最有趣的关于桥牌的书）中，我舅父西蒙（S. J. Simon）建议选手和他的对家“不要追求最好的可能结果，最好结果的可能 ” 。	LONDON – In Why You Lose at Bridge (the funniest book about bridge ever written), my uncle, S. J. Simon, advised players to aim “not for the best possible result, but the best result possible” with the partner you have.
这项新的雨林动议之所以让人印象深刻就是因为它是由发展中国家自己提出的；它代表了提出国的创造性和社会承诺。	Some have suggested waiting to address this issue until 2012, when a revised protocol is supposed to come into effect. But, can we wait?
结果，这些国家把自己推向了持续紧缩、低增长和高债务，同时又切断了所有让私人债权人对主权债务人施加财政纪律的未来激励。	As a result, these countries have condemned themselves to continued austerity, low growth, and high debt, while diminishing any future incentive for private lenders to impose fiscal discipline on sovereign borrowers.
美国继续资助埃及这样独裁的阿拉伯政府（年资助额少说也有20亿美元 ） ， 原因是埃及赞成与以色列实现和平，在阿以冲突中维持了美国对地域政治的影响。	The US continues to subsidize authoritarian Arab regimes, such as Egypt (which receives at least $2 billion a year), because it buys peace with Israel and maintains US geopolitical influence in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
伦敦巴克莱银行（Barclays Bank）计算了26个国家的CAPE市盈率（我为巴克莱的CAPE市盈率相关产品提供顾问 ） 。	Barclays Bank in London compiles the CAPE ratios for 26 countries (I consult for Barclays on its products related to the CAPE ratio).
联合国教科文组织统计研究所新发布的一份令人震惊的报告显示，全球每10个儿童和青少年中有就有6人 — — 合共6亿人 — — 未能习得数学和阅读方面的基本技能。	The results of a staggering new report from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics show that six out of ten children and adolescents around the world – 600 million in total – are not achieving basic skills in mathematics and reading.
他粗俗地用大屠杀隐喻描绘伊朗威胁，看上去他更像是眼看就要被激动的暴徒袭击的犹太居民区长老，而不像是中东最强大国家的总理。	In his vulgar use of Holocaust metaphors to portray the Iranian threat, he sounds more like the principal of a Jewish ghetto about to be annihilated by an agitated mob than the prime minister of the most powerful country in the Middle East.
五天后，活跃的巴基斯坦最高法院以涉嫌所谓的“电力租赁”案为由下令逮捕总理阿什拉夫和16名其他政府高官。	Five days later, Pakistan’s ever-active Supreme Court ordered the arrest of Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and 16 other senior government officials for alleged involvement in what was called the “rental power” case.
不幸的是，扼杀简单方案、掣肘国家和欧洲决策的国内问题，正在众多欧盟最大经济体肆虐，包括法国、德国、意大利、波兰、西班牙和英国。	Unfortunately, domestic issues that defy simple solutions and constrain both national and European policymaking are roiling many of the EU’s biggest economies – France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
因此有理由将阿萨德定为战犯，他因此应当在国际刑事法庭（ICC）受到起诉 — — 顺带说一句，美国从来没有批准过这项议定书。	So there are good reasons to treat Assad as a war criminal, in which case he should be indicted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) – established, incidentally, by a treaty that the US has never ratified.
我们希望更迅速、更果断、更大手笔地行动 — — 不仅在危机尖锐的时期，也通过着重于冲突预防和冲突后管理实现。	We want to act sooner, more decisively, and in a more substantial manner – not just when crises become acute, but also by focusing on conflict prevention and post-conflict management.
大多数决策者和专家都期望，在经过一段不可避免的艰苦转型期后，俄国将会在共同利益和价值的基础上与美国和欧洲一道构成战略和经济夥伴关系。	Most policymakers and experts expected that, after an inevitably troublesome period of transition, Russia would join the United States and Europe in a strategic and economic partnership, based on shared interests and values.
实际上，格林斯潘的政治立场仅仅是草草掩饰为专业智慧，其任期暴露了其作为独立中央银行和没有党派偏见的央行行长的观点是令人怀疑的。	Indeed, Greenspan’s political stances were so thinly disguised as professional wisdom that his tenure exposed the dubiousness of the very notion of an independent central bank and a non-partisan central banker.
通过有目的的建设，我们可以解决股权和人权问题，确保转型的公平性和平稳性，以及能源基础设施具备生态可靠性和民主控制。	If we build it purposefully, we can address issues of equity and human rights, ensuring that the transition is fair and smooth, and that new energy infrastructure is ecologically sound and democratically controlled.
正当各政党争得不可开交之时，贾南德拉国王接替他被谋杀的兄长，在2002年罢黜总理，通过一个任命内阁进行统治。	As political parties bickered, King Gyanendra, who succeeded his murdered brother, sacked the prime minister in 2002 and ruled through an appointed cabinet.
尽管新订立的美俄《削减战略核武器条约 》 （ START）向正确的方向迈出了重要步骤，但较之前冷战对手满满当当的核武库（占全球核武器总量的95 % ） 而言也只是九牛一毛。	The New START agreement between the US and Russia, while a step in the right direction, will only skim the surface off the former Cold War foes’ bloated nuclear arsenals – which account for 95% of the global total.
左翼政党成员埃沃在演讲中提到了巴夏母亲，或自然母亲；右翼政党成员Tuto支持利用《京都议定书》这样的市场机制来支配和控制经济。	On the left, Evo delivers homilies exalting Pacha Mama, or Mother Nature; on the right, Tuto favors market mechanisms like Kyoto over command and control.
如今，内塔尼亚胡升级了其右翼语调 — — 并因此获得又一个执政期 — — 国际社会孤立以色列的运动也将更加热烈。	Now that Netanyahu has intensified his right-wing rhetoric – and been rewarded with another term in power – the international movement to isolate Israel will only gain momentum.
4月30日，喀布尔9名记者被杀害，这一系列背靠背自杀式爆炸至少造成25人死亡，是塔利班倒台以来阿富汗新闻界最血腥的一天，也是全世界的黑暗之日。	The slaying of nine journalists in Kabul on April 30, in back-to-back suicide bombings that killed at least 25 people, marked the deadliest day for journalists in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, and added to a grim global tally.
但在去年的未遂军事政变后，埃尔多安政权授权给自己没收由被控同情所谓的居伦运动（Gülenist movement）的人所拥有的企业。 埃尔多安指控居伦运动策划了政变。	But, after last year’s botched military coup, the regime has empowered itself to seize businesses owned by those accused of sympathizing with the so-called Gülenist movement, which Erdoğan accuses of having masterminded the coup attempt.
按计划，哈萨克燃料银行将在2017年开张营业，它将储存90吨低浓缩铀，足以为三个典型的发电用轻水反应堆提供燃料补给。	Scheduled to commence operations in 2017, the Kazakh fuel bank will store up to 90 tons of LEU, sufficient to refuel three typical power-producing light water reactors.
贫困和饥荒仍然在驱使移民离开穷国；但是，如今，移民的动力不再是免费的土地，而是发达国家更好的工作岗位。	Poverty and starvation still pushed migrants off the land in poor countries; now, however, the pull factor was not free land, but better jobs in developed countries.
接着，欧洲委员会将继续发展我们的当前方案，纳入存款担保机制和银行破产机制，向单一破产基金和单一破产管理当局的方向迈进。	Next, the Commission will build on our current proposals for deposit-guarantee schemes and bank resolution mechanisms to move toward a single resolution fund and a single resolution authority.
因此，欧盟继续坚守开放贸易、全球化和碳减排承诺或许足以阻止转向保护主义和否认气候变化的范式转变。 而随着特朗普的当选，这两个转变大有不可避免之势。	So the EU’s continuing commitment to a philosophy of open trade, globalization, and carbon reduction could be sufficient to prevent a paradigm shift toward protectionism and climate-change denial that seemed almost inevitable with Trump’s election.
就像德国经济学家弗拉茨舍最近在推文中所说的那样 ， “ 某些德国政治家和经济学家的玩世不恭令人难以忍受：他们攻击欧洲央行政策，而该政策最大的受益者是德国政府 — — 自2007年来仅节约的利息就有高达2，940亿欧元之多。	As the German economist Marcel Fratzscher recently tweeted, “The unbearable cynicism of some German politicians and economists: they attack ECB policy, yet Germany’s government is its biggest beneficiary – €294 billion in interest savings since 2007.
在这方面，他们可能会建议，一旦增长恢复，应该在节假日期间征收特别礼品或销售税，甚至在GDP增长速度超过充分就业状态所对应的水平时取消圣诞节。	To that end, they might recommend a special gift or sales tax during the festive season once growth has recovered, or even canceling Christmas when the pace of GDP growth exceeds that consistent with full employment.
在世界领导人齐聚奥斯陆举行峰会的同时，数百万家长在为确保他们的孩子获得应该获得的教育而发愁 — — 这些教育能让他们为自己和家庭赢得更好的生活。	As world leaders gather in Oslo, millions of parents will be struggling to ensure that their children receive the education they deserve – one that will enable them to build better lives for themselves and their families.
他们知道他想让日本加入 泛太平洋伙伴关系计划，他还想让日本加入由美国发起目前正在商讨的大型区域自由贸易协定 — — 上述举措需要日本国内做出某些牺牲。	They know that he intends to follow through on his plan to include Japan in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the US-backed mega-regional free-trade deal currently being negotiated – a move that will require some sacrifices at home.
如果人们有机会过上健康的生活，他们就能够受到教育，为经济做出贡献，照顾自己的家庭，形成进一步提振繁荣和发展的乘数效应。	If people are given the opportunity to lead healthy lives, they can get an education, contribute to the economy, and look after their families, generating a multiplier effect that further boosts prosperity and development.
多米尼克·德·维尔潘政府避开这个挑战，转而选择了“经济爱国主义 ” — —即保护所谓的国家卫士不被外国公司兼并。	Dominique de Villepin’s government turned away from this challenge in favor of “economic patriotism” – that is, protecting supposed national champions from foreign takeover.
但最高法院在2010年所做出的争议性裁决《公民联盟 》 （ Citizens United）使这一目标实现的难度大大增加。 该裁决认定，选战捐赠 — — 即使来自公司 — — 是受保护的言论自由的一种形式。	But the Supreme Court made achieving that much harder with its controversial Citizens United decision in 2010, when it held that campaign donations – even from corporations – are a protected form of free speech.
然而，与晚期肿瘤不同的是，它们不太可能得到许多遗传性改变，因此也不太可能对PARP抑制剂具备抵抗力。	However, unlike fully developed tumors, they are not likely to have acquired many genetic changes and are therefore unlikely to have gained resistance to PARP inhibitors.
运用这一方法，高威国立大学的研究者们指出，覆盖安得拉邦的这170万妇女能够带来价值约5.5亿美元的总收益。	Using this approach, the NUI Galway researchers show that reaching those 1.7 million women in Andhra Pradesh could create total benefits worth about $550 million.
是的，对中国的赤字是这一失衡的最大组成部分，但这只不过反映了跨国供应链的复杂性和离岸效率方案的益处。	Yes, trade with China is the largest component of this imbalance, but that largely reflects the complexity of multinational supply chains and the benefits of offshore efficiency solutions.
IMF可以根据其新借贷安排（NAB）成立一个特殊机构，其资本结构可以以EFSF为第一损失缓冲，以IMF的资本作为第二损失缓冲。	The IMF could set up a special vehicle along the lines of its New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), which would be capitalized by a first-loss layer from the EFSF with the IMF’s own capital comprising a second layer.
今年六月，北约的首脑们一起纪念D日 - - 也就是第二次世界大战中盟军在当时被纳粹占领的法国的登陆日 - - 60周年。	In June, NATO's leaders commemorated the 60th anniversary of D-Day, the allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France.
因此，如果阿根廷公共部门在未来几年汇总刚遇到债务危机，就必须接受IMF的督导 — — IMF本身也是债权人，同时也受到国际债权人的主导。	Thus, if Argentina’s public sector falls into a state of debt distress in the coming years, it will have to submit to the tutelage of the IMF – a creditor in itself, but also an institution that is dominated by international creditors.
可恶评级可以成为软国际法的一部分，法庭可用它来裁定如何强制执行债务契约。 它也可以帮助确定哪些债券可以纳入新兴市场指数的计算。	Odiousness ratings could become part of soft international law, used by courts when deciding how to enforce debt contracts, and they could help determine which bonds are included in the calculation of emerging-market indexes.
首先，逐渐明显的中国经济疲软迹象以及该国一系列非典型的政策盲动令人们对全球经济整体健康状况的担忧日益增加。	First, mounting signs of economic weakness in China and a series of uncharacteristic policy stumbles there still raise concerns about the overall health of the global economy.
人均收入基尼系数已经超过了50（100代表最大程度的不平等 ） ， 这意味着中国已经步入世界上最不平等的四分之一国家行列。	The Gini coefficient of per capita income has surpassed 50 (with 100 representing maximal inequality), putting China in the upper quartile of inequality worldwide.
但那些对手册第五版制定修改意见的精神病学家却没有接受过概念分析方面的训练，而且，虽然事先已经受到了警告，他们却依然用一种不系统的临时性手法来应对“正常还是障碍”的问题。	Yet the psychiatrists who formulated the DSM-5’s proposed changes are not trained in conceptual analysis, and, though amply forewarned, they have addressed the normal-versus-disordered issue in an unsystematic, ad hoc manner.
事实上，极少数敢于挑战这类统治的工人运动成员和知识分子也不是想改变整个系统，而只是想从中分一杯羹而已。	Indeed, the few trade unionists, intellectuals, and others who challenge these regimes usually do not seek to change how the state functions, but rather to ensure that, as they put it, they get their “turn to eat.”
比如法国从来没有遭遇过任何欧盟强加的紧缩政策；甚至欧盟委员会主席让-克劳德·容克（Jean-Claude Juncker）都承认，法国实际上不受欧盟的预算规则控制 — — “因为法国就是老大啊 。 ”	In France, there was never any EU-imposed austerity; even European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker admitted that the EU’s budget rules cannot actually be imposed on France, “because it is France.”
我们生活在世俗的世界里，自由言论很容易转变成不得体、不负责任的嘲讽，而其他人视宗教为其最高目标，甚至是最后一线希望。	We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
但到了1960年，这种短期的愉悦已经让位于曾受他利用重新掌权的人们的仇恨，这些人将他视为叛徒，恨不能令他和他一手创立的政权一同消失掉。	But, by 1960, euphoria had given way to rancor among those whom he had used to regain office but who now saw him as a traitor to be neutralized along with the regime he had brought into being.
但是，尽管恐怖和饥馑已不复存在，但许多过去的镇压手段在普京的暴政下 — — 目前正处于第14年 — — 卷土重来。	But, while terror and famine have been absent, many of the oppressive tactics of the past have been revived under Vladimir Putin’s misrule, now in its 14th year.
要改变巨船的航向 — — 就本文而言，就是美国经济 — — 需要很长时间，即使特朗普真的让国会通过了他的经济日程的一些方案，对于增长的影响也可能要到2018年才会感觉得到。	Altering the course of a giant ship – in this case, the US economy – takes a long time, and even if Trump ever does manage to get some of his economic agenda through the US Congress, the growth effects are not likely to be felt until well into 2018.
人权观察组织美洲分部的执行主任在过去十年中就科雷亚，查韦斯/马杜罗和莫拉莱斯对法治的破坏提出过多项警告。	The executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Americas Division has raised several warnings over the past decade about the deterioration of the rule of law under Correa, Chávez/Maduro, and Morales.
他们对本地产品的轻视蔓延到了卫生和教育方面，他们不在本国对这些部门追加投资，而是设法让自己和子女们在国外享受私人医疗和教育。	Their contempt for local products extends to health and education: rather than invest in these vital sectors, Africa’s rulers use private overseas healthcare and schools for themselves and their children.
于是电视上出现了英国水兵“悔罪”的镜头，叫嚣要到美国大使馆 （ “ 间谍窝 ” ） 抓人质，以及外国大使馆门前群众集会的场景。	Hence the televised “confessions” that hearkened back to the taking of hostages in the American Embassy (the “nest of spies”), and the rallies against foreign embassies.
如果没有第二大支柱 ， “ 世界工厂”就只能是海市蜃楼。 这第二大支柱便是“���国基础设施网 ” ， 大部分由物流、能源、公路、通讯、航运和港口等行业的垂直整合型国有企业建设和经营。	The “world factory” could not have been built without the second pillar: the “China infrastructure network,” installed and operated mostly by vertically integrated state-owned enterprises in logistics, energy, roads, telecoms, shipping, and ports.
但是，自大衰退以来，全球商业贸易增长陷入了停滞，主要原因是世界主要经济体需求萎靡和大宗商品价格暴跌。	Since the Great Recession, however, growth in global merchandise trade has stalled, mainly owing to anemic demand in the world’s major economies and plummeting commodity prices.
否则如何解释他与该报主要竞争对手Yedioth Ahronot的所有者论缩减《今日以色列》发行量以换取对他更加有利的报道？	In what other capacity could he have discussed with the owner of its main competitor, Yedioth Ahronot, the possibility of curtailing the distribution of Israel Hayom, in exchange for more favorable coverage?
虽然这些担心几乎没有达到像诺贝尔经济学奖��得者约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨这样的人进行的完全的正面攻击的程度，它们仍然表明了一个显著的学术氛围的转变。	While these worries hardly amount to the full frontal attack mounted by the likes of Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-prize winning economist, they still constitute a remarkable turnaround in the intellectual climate.
安理会在2005年3月决定将达尔富尔局势提交国际刑事法院的检察官，这本身就是打击有罪不罚的现象的一个重要的里程碑。	The Security Council’s decision to refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC prosecutor in March 2005 was itself a major milestone in the battle against impunity.
朝鲜奥运选手和拉拉队员在乘火车抵达韩国时无疑将会得到热烈的欢迎，而在两国运动员举着同一面旗帜步入体育场时将面对人们的热烈欢呼。	North Korea’s Olympians and cheerleaders will undoubtedly be greeted enthusiastically when they arrive by train in the South, and the crowd will roar its approval when athletes from the two countries march into the stadium under the same banner.
我们还指出存在自其他国家输入中国装配平台的原料所引起的供应链扭曲现象，一旦把这种统计手法纠正过来将会令美中贸易失衡数字减少35~40 ％ ， 但应者寥寥。	Nor does it matter when we point out that correcting for supply-chain distortions – caused by inputs from other countries that enter into Chinese assembly platforms – would reduce the bilateral US-China trade imbalance by 35-40%.
昔日的美联储通常拥有魅力超凡、独断专行的专业中央银行家主席：斯特朗（Benjamin Strong ） 、 艾克尔斯（Marriner Eccles ） 、 马丁（William McChesney Martin ） 、 沃克尔和格林斯潘莫不如此。	The Fed of old usually had a charismatic, autocratic, professional central banker at its head: Benjamin Strong, Marriner Eccles, William McChesney Martin, Paul Volcker, and Alan Greenspan.
如果缺少这一社会粘合剂 — — 如同以色列人和巴勒斯坦人 — — 人们就无法利用所有可获得的经济机会。	Where this social glue is lacking – such as between Israelis and Palestinians – people cannot exploit all of the available economic opportunities.
中国人只愿意和那些持有相同观点的势力对话，但美国却喜欢接近那些不同意它的人，并用自身的活力去感染之。	With China, like seeks to talk to like. With America, like deliberately engages with unlike, and tries to infuse it with some of its vigor.
发自加州拉古纳海滩 — — 对全球经济来说这都是不寻常的一年，充斥着一系列意料之外的经济，地缘政治和市场动荡 — — 而最后一个季度也是如此。	LAGUNA BEACH – This has been an unusual year for the global economy, characterized by a series of unanticipated economic, geopolitical, and market shifts – and the final quarter is likely to be no different.
据一些媒体的报道，为了保证中国同意在APEC峰会期间参加悔悟，安倍甚至愿意承认日本对钓鱼岛的主张是有争议的。	According to some media reports, in order to secure China’s agreement to participate in a meeting during the APEC summit, Abe even agreed to acknowledge that Japan’s claim to the Senkaku Islands is disputed.
以不可燃形式使用尼古丁 — — 如无烟烟草或PNV — — 可以让数百万烟民大幅减少尼古丁消费现在给他们的健康带来的伤害。	The use of nicotine in non-combustible forms like smokeless tobacco, or PNV, would enable millions of current smokers to reduce considerably the harm that their nicotine consumption is doing to their health.
这些新富起来的外省民众厌恶原来的伊斯坦布尔精英就像得克萨斯或堪萨斯商人痛恨纽约华盛顿的东海岸精英一样。	These newly rich provincials resent the old Istanbul elite as much as businessmen from Texas or Kansas hate the East Coast elites of New York and Washington.
在这一镇压和干预民主的背景下，伊斯兰教在埃及和土耳其的失败所揭示的伊斯兰教与民主的兼容性问题并不像我们想象的那样严重。	Given this backdrop of repression and punctuated democracy, the failure of Islamists in Egypt and Turkey tells us less about Islam’s compatibility with democracy than we might think.
经历过这段历史的南非医疗专业人士 — — 事实上远不止南非 — — 对特朗普的扩大版的政策敲响了警钟。	It is with this history in mind that health-care professionals in South Africa – and far beyond – are raising the alarm about Trump’s expanded policy.
有见及此，我们要求实现一个与经济寡头势力的腐蚀性影响脱钩的真正民主，同时呼吁那些认同这一共同目标的人们与我们一起行动起来，共同实现这一点 。 ”	We therefore demand true democracy, decoupled from the corrosive influence of concentrated economic power, and we call all who share in this common goal to stand with us and take action toward this end.”
退役的海军四星上将凯利在2017年7月末从国土安全部部长调任白宫参谋长办公室，把西区管理的井井有条。	Kelly, the retired four-star Marine general who in late July 2017 switched from Secretary of Homeland Security to White House chief of staff, has established some order in the West Wing.
去年9月，在哈萨克斯坦巴扎尔巴耶夫大学（Nazarbayev University）的演讲中，习近平提出了所谓的“丝绸之路经济带 ” ， 这是一项旨在增进欧亚地区国际合作和联合开发的新外交政策。	In September of last year, in a speech at Kazakhstan’s Nazarbayev University, Xi announced the so-called “Silk Road Economic Belt,” a new foreign-policy initiative aimed at boosting international cooperation and joint development throughout Eurasia.
跑步等运动相对来说成本较低，但其他运动 — — 包括体操、游泳，以及比它们更甚的团队运动和马术 — — 要求巨大的资源投入。	While sports like running are relatively inexpensive, others – including gymnastics, swimming, and even more so team games and equestrian events – require significant resources.
恐怖和战争的景象不断烦扰着人们，然而全球各个地区都不同程度地经历了多年来最强劲的经济增长。 尽管油价飙升，通货膨胀却保持在低水平，金融市场也势态良好。	Yet every region of the globe has experienced some of the strongest economic growth seen in years, inflation remains subdued despite surging oil prices, and financial markets are doing well.
但是现在开放教育运动已经整合起来，这样，任何地方的任何人都可以写作、收集、调整以及出版他们自己的开放课程或者课本。	But now the puzzle pieces of the Open Education movement have come together, so that anyone, anywhere can write, assemble, customize, and publish their own open course or textbook.
但你在巴塞罗那的街头看不到丝毫平静，在这里，支持加泰罗尼亚独立（独立公投被政府力量残酷镇压）的示威遇上了同样强有力的反独立游行。	But calm is the last thing one can see on the streets of Barcelona, where demonstrations in favor of Catalonian independence – a referendum on which was brutally suppressed by government forces – have been met with equally potent protests against it.
尽管中国出口商品的市场份额似乎保持得不错，但其原因 — — 在外国市场的降价行动 — — 并没有可持续性。	Though the market shares of Chinese exports seem to have held up quite well, this is attributable to price-cutting in foreign markets, which is not sustainable.
比如，OONI的网络连通性测试可以检查网站接入是否通过DNS削弱、TCP/IP封禁或透明HTTP代理封禁。	OONI’s Web-Connectivity Test, for example, is designed to examine whether access to websites is blocked through DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, or a transparent HTTP proxy.
由于欧洲和美国由于不同的原因正在采取鼓励欧元大幅升值到危险水平的货币政策，因此，一场完美风暴正在形成。	The perfect storm is forming because both Europe and America, for different reasons, are following monetary policies that encourage the euro to rocket to dangerous levels.
彼得·舒克（Peter Schuck）的新书《为何政府屡战屡败 》 （ Why Government Fails So Often）提供了周详的悲观分析。	Peter Schuck’s new book Why Government Fails So Often provides a thoughtful if pessimistic analysis.
尽管如此，从整体看，有理由期待让穷人获得知识和与世界各地人们取得联系的可能性将以十分积极的形式推动社会变迁。	On the whole, though, it is reasonable to expect that giving poor people access to knowledge and the possibility of connecting with people anywhere in the world will be socially transforming in a very positive way.
结果，主要是在中间偏右政府时期，数个产品市场解除了管制，包括电信、电力、道路交通、出租车以及铁路的某些领域。	Subsequently, mainly during a period of center-right governance, several product markets were deregulated: telecommunications, electricity, road transport, taxis, and, to some extent, railways.
市场本身既不有效也不稳定，但是撤销管制的政治行为为前所未有的过剩留出了余地，从而引起资产泡沫和泡沫破裂后的滚动危机。	Markets on their own may be neither efficient nor stable, but the politics of deregulation gave scope to unprecedented excesses that led to asset bubbles and the rolling crisis that has followed their collapse.
所有这些都给了哈夫塔尔筹码，如今，他不会支持任何可能挑战他的利比亚国民军（Libyan National Army）和众议院权威的协定。	All of this gives Haftar leverage, and he would not support any agreement that would challenge his Libyan National Army or the House of Representatives’ authority.
其次，排名的变化可以由一国相对另一国做了什么决定，也可以由营商报告在某个年度所进行的衡量指标变化决定 — — 比如上文所提及的变化。	Second, any change in ranking can be driven either by what a country does relative to other countries, or by measurement changes that the DB may have instituted in a given year – changes like those mentioned above.
啮齿类和人类控制威胁状态下的行为反应的大脑系统大同小异，都涉及到深藏于大脑中、不受意识控制的古老区域（比如杏仁体 ） 。	The brain systems that control behavioral responses in threatening situations are similar in rodents and humans, and involve older areas deep in the brain that work nonconsciously (for example, the amygdala).
欧洲领导人应该向美国表明自己愿意建立一个钢铁生产商自愿出口限制组织，而不是张牙舞爪地挥舞着即将加征关税的一长串产品清单。	Instead of blustering and showing off long lists of products on which the EU will now impose tariffs, European leaders should signal to the US that they are willing to organize a VER for their steel producers.
极高的年轻人失业率 — — 在西班牙和希腊据信接近50 % ， 在整个欧元区超过20 % — —每天都能登上报纸标题。	Outrageously high youth unemployment – supposedly near 50% in Spain and Greece, and more than 20% in the eurozone as a whole – makes headlines daily.
2017年11月，我所在大学的抗生素耐药性研究中心（CARe）举办了这一话题的首次大型研讨会，经济学、伦理学、法律、政策、社会科学和卫生等领域的著名学者齐聚一堂。	Then, in November 2017, the Centre for Antibiotic Resistance Research (CARe) at my own university held the first-ever major symposium on the topic, bringing together leading scholars in economics, ethics, law, policy, social science, and health care.
全世界最大的20个交易会（由室内展出面积衡量）有25个在德国举办，而且德国也在自然资源出口商位居首位。	Fifteen of the world’s 20 biggest trade fairs (measured by indoor exhibition space) are held in Germany, and the country tops the list in world commodity exports.
比如，到本世纪末，中东很多地方可能会变得太热而无法居住；而新德里等重污染城市可能会经历全年200多天气温超过35℃的日子。	Parts of the Middle East, for example, could become too hot for humans by the end of this century; and heavily populated cities such as New Delhi could experience temperatures over 95º Fahrenheit (35º C) up to 200 days out of the year.
发自柏林 — — 两年多以来欧洲已经接连召开了多个峰会，而且每一场在闭幕时都向外界保证遏制欧元区主权债务危机的必要手段“终于”得以推行。	BERLIN – For two years now, one European summit after another has ended with assurances that – at long last – the necessary measures for containing the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis have been taken.
形形色色原教旨主义分子的教条既咄咄逼人又为祸不浅，它们都有着共同的特色： 那就是植根于对现代社会的恐惧和愤懑的气势汹汹的怨恨。	The strident and damaging dogmatism of fundamentalists of every stripe has a common feature: a truculent sense of grievance, rooted in fear and resentment of modernity.
因此有5年时间，我享受着为数以万计学子授予学位的体验，并亲眼目睹了这样的仪式对学子和他们的家庭意味着什么。	So for five years I enjoyed the experience of giving tens of thousands of students their degrees and watching what this rite of passage meant for them and their families.
你可以进一步了解特别报告员的工作，并访问Hilalelver.org查看她关于农场劳动者和粮食权问题的正式报告。	You can learn more about the work of the Special Rapporteur, and access her official report on agricultural workers and the right to food at Hilalelver.org.
大部分影子银行系统消失了，传统商业银行在资本仍然严重不足的情况下，却背负了预期会达到几万亿美元的贷款和证券方面的损失。	Most of the shadow banking system has disappeared, and traditional commercial banks are saddled with trillions of dollars in expected losses on loans and securities while still being seriously undercapitalized.
比如，不但升级了其对日本对尖阁列岛（钓鱼岛）几十年控制权的挑战，还从去年控制黄岩岛开始于菲律宾针锋相对。	For example, China has not only escalated its challenge to Japan’s decades-old control of the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands, but is also facing off against the Philippines since taking effective control of Scarborough Shoal last year.
对这一规模庞大且不断增长的需求源的高效的供给端响应要求诸多服务业的监管改革，包括金融、产品安全、交通和物流等方面。	An efficient supply-side response to this large and growing source of demand requires regulatory reform in many services, including finance, product safety, transport, and logistics.
目前看来，欧洲正在经历一场幅度不大但较为显著的经济增长，令人不禁猜测政策制定者会否利用这个机会来寻求必要的改革。	As it happens, Europe is currently experiencing a modest but significant surge in growth. But whether policymakers will take advantage of this opportunity to pursue needed reforms is anyone’s guess.
尽管美国的劳动力市场正在收紧，以及新任美联储主席着重强调就业最大化的重要性，但在不久的将来，高通货膨胀的风险依然很小。	Though US labor markets are tightening, and the new Fed chair has emphatically emphasized the importance of maximum employment, there is still little risk of high inflation in the near future.
同样，在1930年代的大萧条时期，美国通过借助重建金融公司（Reconstruction Finance Corporation）来获取银行所有权并进行资本重组，并通过房屋所有者贷款公司（Home Owners’ Loan Corporation）来管理抵押贷款重组。	Similarly, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the US took ownership and recapitalized banks via the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) and managed mortgage restructuring through the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC).
我们可以投资的财富只能是那些看起来是可以流动的资产，仅仅是我们对流动资金还没有大规模的需求的时候才可能如此。	Our invested wealth can only be made to appear liquid to any one of us, and only if there is no general shift in our collective desire for liquidity.
对家庭收入状况的援助应该双线推进：一方面是业已成熟的现金转移支付，另一方面是目前远远落后于需求的基本就业保证。	Household income support should run on twin tracks: cash transfers, already well-established, and basic employment assurance, which lags well behind needs.
总目标应该是建设这样的社会：只要身体健康允许，公民可以工作和纳税到将近70岁，但随着年龄的增长，工作环境应该根据个人状况增加弹性。	The overall objective should be a society in which, health permitting, citizens work and pay taxes until close to the age of 70, but less intensively with advancing age and in a flexible manner that reflects individual circumstances.
与此同时，其余18个欧元区成员国应考虑是否需要更新它们在欧元主权债务危机最为深重时形成的2012年“财政契约 ” 。	In the meantime, the remaining 18 eurozone member states should consider whether the 2012 “fiscal compact” that they forged in the thick of the euro sovereign-debt crisis needs to be updated.
在欧盟国家中，意大利在过去十年中经历了第二大幅度的产出萎缩（仅次于希腊 ） — —这一趋势导致经济福祉大幅恶化。	Among EU countries, Italy has experienced the second-largest decline in output (after Greece) during the last decade – a trend that caused a significant deterioration in economic welfare.
主要反对平派领导人印度人民党（BJP）的莫迪（Narendra Modi）激进地声称继承了印度最受尊敬的开国元勋之一帕特尔（Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel）的衣钵。	The main opposition leader, Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has moved aggressively to lay claim to the legacy of one of India’s most respected founders, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
这种转移支付从就不是这一经济和货币联盟的特点，欧洲央行显然也不具备强制推动该联盟根本性变革的职权 — — 尤其是在这些变化只有利于一个国家集团的情况下。	Such transfers were never supposed to be a feature of the Economic and Monetary Union, and it is clearly not within the ECB’s mandate to force fundamental changes to the EMU system – especially if those changes favor one group of countries.
如果没有共同体制，欧洲人就无法免于遭受那些被大企业及其政治代理人粉饰成经济常识的剥削和反社会行为的侵害。	Without common institutions, Europeans cannot be defended from the exploitation and anti-social practices that big business and its political agents portray as economic common sense.
这种怀旧政治很有问题，不仅因为法国和欧洲都正面临着严峻的经济挑战，还由于法国和其他民主国家都在面对着对自身合法性的真正挑战。	This politics of nostalgia is troubling, not only because France and Europe confront severe economic challenges, but also because France and other democracies are confronted with real challenges to their legitimacy.
若是他们在与中国的激烈竞争中输掉了这块巨大的经济市场蛋糕，那将是一个致命的打击，因为纺织品出口通常来说是发展贸易过程中的第一步。	Losing this sector of the economy to the hyper-competitive Chinese will be a hard hit, as textile exports are often the first step on the development ladder.
马杜罗政府指责委内瑞拉经济崩溃是拜美国、寡头和国际金融锡安主义所领导的“经济战争”所赐，我则是他们的代理人。	Maduro’s government blames its economic collapse on an “economic war” led by the US, the oligarchy, and international financial Zionism, of which I am supposedly an agent.
二十来岁的人可以借钱去买房子，建立家庭，以及去度假，等他们五十多岁的时候再把钱还回来，然后呆在家里享受天伦之乐。	People in their twenties could borrow money to buy a house, start a family, and go on holiday, paying the money back when they are in their fifties and would much rather stay at home and enjoy their grandchildren.
如今，全世界死亡人数中有三分之二是非传染性疾病（NCD ） — —如心脏病、糖尿病和癌症等 — — 引起的。	Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) – such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer – now account for two-thirds of all deaths worldwide.
换言之，虽然新兴市场国家 — — 由于其对资本流的依赖 — — 会在美国货币政策逐渐恢复“常态”后面临风险，但发达国家也不太可能置身事外。	In other words, though emerging markets – through their dependence on capital inflows – will be at risk when America’s monetary policy eventually returns to “normal,” the same will be true for advanced economies.
最后一个出局条件 — — 将在“金融政策委员会（FPC）判断货币政策立场对金融稳定性构成了重大威胁”时发生 — — 指向第三个问题。	The final knockout – which would occur if “the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) judges that the stance of monetary policy poses a significant threat to financial stability” – points to the third problem.
除非接受过高等教育的印度人站起来为所有的人争取更好的学校，否则，反对种姓优先的抗议活动将只会增加局势的紧张程度，出售更多的报纸，而不会改善印度贫穷人口的生活。	Unless India’s highly educated stand up for better schools for all, protests against caste preferences will only succeed in heightening tensions and selling newspapers, rather than improving the lives of India’s destitute.
与此同时，在中国，30,000名工人正在试图改变天气，实施飞机人工降雨或用高射机枪发射凝结核，以期从天上“骗”点雨水下来。	Meanwhile, in China, some 30,000 workers are trying to change the weather, attempting to seed clouds from airplanes or using anti-aircraft guns to shoot shells into the air, hoping to coax some rain from the sky.
议会 — — 代议制机构 — — 对预算进行投票，这保证了作为一个整体的人民需要为其政府产生的债务承担责任。	Voting budgets in parliament – a representative institution – ensured that the people as a whole were liable for the obligations incurred by their government.
正如纽约大学教授、阿富汗问题专家巴内特·鲁宾所言 ： “ 如果阿富汗最具有活力的经济部门是非法的话，它就不可能得到稳定。 如果其超过一半的经济被毁，也不可能做到稳定 。 ”	As New York University’s Barnett Rubin, an expert on Afghan society, has put it: “Afghanistan cannot be stabilized while the most dynamic sector of its economy is illegal, nor if more than half of its economy is destroyed.”
这反映出与埃及基督徒相似的境况恶化，在埃及，基督徒占据着约15%的人口。 4月初，圣马可大教堂（St.	This reflects the similarly deteriorating situation for Christians in Egypt, where they account for roughly 15% of the population.
但经济利益的介入似乎总会驱动对新药收益的高估和对风险的低估，最终推动相关处方的开具，从而扭曲这一过程。	But the financial interests involved tend to distort the process by creating incentives to overestimate the benefits of new drugs, underestimate the risks, and, above all, boost prescriptions.
芝加哥 — — 如果未来几天内出台的欧洲危机解决方案想要重塑人们对主权债券的信心的话，那么该计划就必须在经济上可行，而且在政治上可以让救援者和被救援者双方接受。	CHICAGO – If any solution to the European crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereign-bond markets, it will have to be both economically viable and politically palatable to rescuers and rescued alike.
而急剧流传的全球变暖故事则向人们描绘了一幅食品短缺以及世界各地土地价值重估的图景，而这将促使投资者进一步加大投资。	And the highly contagious global-warming story paints a scenario of food shortages and shifts in land values in different parts of the world, which might boost investor interest further.
1989年11月9日的夜晚，标志着苏联以及整个苏维埃帝国崩溃的开始，同时也是分裂德国和整个欧洲的两极世界终结的开始。	The night of November 9, 1989, marked the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union and its empire, and thus also of the bipolar world that had, for five decades, divided Germany and Europe.
这意味着将重点从当前这种试图保护已就业劳动者的倒退式劳动力市场政策转向面向未来的多种措施，比如创新的保险机制和积极的劳动力市场政策。	This means shifting the focus from backward-looking labor-market policies, which seek to protect workers in existing jobs, to future-oriented measures, such as innovative insurance mechanisms and active labor-market policies.
比如，美国和欧洲均已和许多拉丁美洲国家签订了自由贸易条约，这意味着可以建立一个地理范围极广的自由贸易区，从而增强抵御全球危机的韧性。	For example, both have already signed free-trade treaties with various Latin American countries, implying the creation of a geographically enormous free-trade area, which should boost economic resilience in the face of global crisis.
按照这位离过两次婚、公开声称自己是“文化天主教徒”的总统的说法，法国应该建立一种“积极的世俗主义 ” 。	In particular, according to the twice-divorced self-confessed “cultural Catholic,” France should develop a “positive secularism.”
从2000年到2008年，全美前14家金融机构的管理者总共获得了大约26亿美元的现金津贴（包括工资，分红和股票出售在内 ） 。	From 2000 to 2008, the people running the top 14 US financial institutions received cash compensation (salary, bonus, and the value of stock sold) of around $2.6 billion.
因此，只有肿瘤细胞才会有一个功能不正常的重组通道，并完全依赖PARP在复制DNA之前完成修补单个碱基断裂。	Thus, only the tumor cells will have a non-functional recombination pathway and rely completely on PARP to repair single-strand breaks before copying the DNA.
事实上，巴勒斯坦人和以色列左翼似乎突然之间成为特朗普的“迷弟迷妹 ” ， 尽管这与其说意味着真正的突破机会，不如说体现了他们的绝望。	In fact, both the Palestinians and the Israeli left seem to have suddenly become infatuated with Trump, though that may signal their despair more than a real chance of a breakthrough.
国际货币基金组织在2006年启动的对全球失衡的多边监管，是朝向这个方向发展的一个引人兴味的措施，但是，这一措施缺乏成员国的承诺，也没有执行机构。	The multilateral surveillance on global imbalances that the Fund launched in 2006 was an interesting step in this direction, but it has lacked commitment by the parties, as well as teeth.
由于昂贵的建造成本 — — 据估计高达10亿美元左右，美国决定不像英国那样建立国家级的生物银行，因此23andMe踌躇满志地认为不断增长的生物银行可以节省一大笔开支。	Given that the United States decided not to create a national biobank like the United Kingdom’s, owing to the high set-up costs – estimated at about a billion dollars – 23andMe may well view its growing biobank as saving it a massive outlay.
这一切将如何发生目前尚不清楚，但我们可以放心，新的人造物不会让恐慌制造者的警告变成现实，也不会带来反乌托邦科幻小说中的情景。	It is unclear how all of this will play out, but we can rest assured that new artificial agents will not confirm the scaremongers’ warnings, or usher in a dystopian science-fiction scenario.
此外，由于世界领导人及其发展伙伴再一次没能满足妇女的基本生育健康需要，在实现可持续发展日程方面取得切实进展变得更加困难了。	And, because world leaders and their development partners have failed to meet women’s basic reproductive-health needs once again, it will be more difficult to achieve concrete progress toward realizing the agenda for sustainable development.
即使在2007年后这些谬误令市场原教旨主义经济学颜面扫地，但市场原教旨主义政治学仍然大行其道，阻止人们对危机采取充分的政策反应。	Even as these fallacies blew up market-fundamentalist economics after 2007, market-fundamentalist politics survived, preventing an adequate policy response to the crisis.
就像总是会发生的那样， 菲尔普斯在与一位重要的教授碰面后最终选择了他的职业，在这里这位重要的教授是哈佛大学的经济学家尼尔森。	As nearly always happens, Phelps’s choice of vocation came after meeting an important professor, in this case the Harvard economist James Nelson.
当约旦方面坚持必须在约旦河两岸建立一个政治空间的概念时，以色列则用地中海和约旦河之间只能有一个政治空间的概念相回应。	Whereas the latter champion the concept of one political space that would include the two banks of the Jordan River, the Israelis respond with their own concept of one political space between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River.
低收入家庭（以及收入和财产被高额医疗费用耗尽的人）可以参与由各州及联邦政府共同出资的Medicaid计划。	Low-income families (and those whose income and assets are depleted by high medical costs) are covered by the Medicaid program, which is financed jointly by the states and federal government.
即使在二战结束整整十年后，著名经济学家加尔布雷斯（John Kenneth Galbraith）预测世界可能经历又一场萧条，市场应声慌乱。	Even a full decade after World War II, when the famous economist John Kenneth Galbraith opined that the world might experience another depression, markets went into a tizzy.
这些住宅项目与好工作所在地区相去甚远，住户中也鲜有家庭和睦、生活安康者，因此缺乏能指引年轻人的成功榜样。	Not only were the housing projects kept a safe distance from areas that had good jobs, but, with few residents experiencing stable families and livelihoods, there were not enough local examples of success to guide young people.
原因很简单：金属的使用被许多其它材料代替了，但这些材料却大都需要以石化产品为原料。 而且我们在开发足够代替能源方面的数十年努力成效甚微。	The reason is simple: metal usage has been substituted by many alternatives, but most still require petroleum products as inputs, and decades-long efforts to develop sufficient alternative energy sources have yielded little success.
此外，尽管千年发展目标（Millennium Development Goals）在教育、婴儿死亡率和疟疾和结核病等疾病等关键领域取得了令人瞩目的成就，但仍有很长的路要走。	And while the Millennium Development Goals have produced remarkable progress in key areas – including education, infant mortality, and diseases like malaria and tuberculosis – there is still a long way to go.
他们认为，西方对治理形式而非包容性经济和社会发展成果的关注是有误导性的，因为民主和专制制度都可能滋生腐败。	The focus in the West on the form of governance, as opposed to inclusive economic and social outcomes, is misguided, they believe, because both democratic and autocratic systems can be corrupted.
据最新估算，美国政府的无力支付负债高达GDP的260 % — —这还不包括常规联邦债务和无力支付的州和地方政府负债。	According to recent estimates, the US government’s unfunded liabilities are a staggering 260% of GDP – and that does not include conventional federal debt and unfunded state and local government liabilities.
最后，卢旺达非洲女性教育人士论坛（FAWE）已经资助了在该国优秀高中学习科学、技术、工程和数学等学科领域的1，200名女性学生接受教育。	Finally, the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) in Rwanda has funded the education of 1,200 girls enrolled at the country’s top-performing secondary schools specializing in STEM subjects.
事实上，邵德家族的第三和第四代不仅在政治和宗教从属上存在分歧，年龄跨度也很大，从20岁至90岁不等。	Indeed, the Al Saud clan’s third and fourth generations are divided not only in political and religious affiliation, but also range in age from 20 to 90 years old.
因此，欧洲所有国家的中左翼政党已经开始修改路线，其中几个重要国家的社会民主党改变了长期坚持的移民问题态度。	As a result, center-left parties across Europe have begun to change course, with social democrats in several key countries changing long-held positions on migration.
没有人愿意重复布什总统领导下美国的错误；但利用那些错误作为逃避直面世界的借口只能是错误的另外一种表现形式。	No one wants to repeat the errors of the US under President George W. Bush; but to use those errors as an alibi to avoid confronting the world as it is would merely be an error of a different sort.
洛杉矶 — — 前任总统乔治·W·布什不久前出版的回忆录披露2007年春他曾拒绝了以色列摧毁叙利亚秘密核反应堆的要求。	LOS ANGELES – Revelations in former President George W. Bush’s recently published memoirs show that he declined an Israeli request to destroy Syria’s secret nuclear reactor in the spring of 2007.
通过将实际（计入通胀后的）股票指数除以十年的平均收益水平，可以计算出周期调整后的市盈率比率，而如果该比率高于平均水平则意味着低于平均水平的回报。	The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio is found by dividing the real (inflation-adjusted) stock index by the average of ten years of earnings, with higher-than-average ratios implying lower-than-average returns.
3月27日周六，晚上8:30，超过120个国家的将近10亿群众关灯一小时，以表达为应对全球变暖出一份力的心愿。	At the stroke of 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 27, nearly a billion people in more than 120 countries demonstrated their desire to do something about global warming by switching off their lights for an hour.
这两个计划的目标是创造2,500万个新工作岗位和提振增长。 这与维持福利的承诺一道，意味着现代形式的凯恩斯主义财政政策（当然不会这样起名 ） 。	This, together with a pledge to maintain welfare entitlements, amounts to a modern form of Keynesian fiscal policy (though of course not identified as such).
但是这很可能会随着公投临近而改变，而风险在于，卡梅隆有可能成为，照丘吉尔的话说，那个在自己的政党和国家之间选择了前者，却最终同时失去了一切的领导人。	But that is likely to change as the vote approaches and the risk grows that he will be remembered as the leader who, to paraphrase Churchill, was given a choice between his party and his country, chose his party, and ended up losing both.
实现这一目标的唯一途径是提高准入价格或凌驾国家主权之上以增加移民的总数 — — 两个选项在政治上都是站不住脚的。	The only way to achieve that would be to increase the price of admission or override national sovereignty to increase the total number of slots – both politically untenable options.
哥本哈根—在过去的一个世纪里，确保妇女和女孩平等性的斗争在教室、投票站和《财富》500强公司董事会中进行着。	COPENHAGEN – During the last century, the battle to secure equality for women and girls has been fought in the classroom, in the voting booth, and in the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies.
结果，诸多全球性挑战 — — 气候变化、贸易、资源稀缺性、国际安全、网络战、核扩散等等 — — 将注定愈演愈烈。	As a result, many global challenges – climate change, trade, resource scarcity, international security, cyber-warfare, and nuclear proliferation, to name a few – are bound to loom larger.
如果投资者怀疑德国的金融基本面健康状况和决心，欧洲央行行长德拉吉在2012年夏所做出的“竭尽全力”拯救欧元的承诺还会如此有效吗？	Would European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s vow in the summer of 2012 to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro have been nearly as effective if investors doubted Germany’s underlying financial strength and resolve?
少数商品丰富国 — — 如博茨瓦纳、智利和挪威 — — 成功地抵制了资源魔咒，但也没能实现经济的多元化，仍然依赖于基于自然资源的出口。	While a handful of commodity-rich countries have managed to buck the curse, including Botswana, Chile, and Norway, they have, nevertheless, failed to diversify their economies, remaining dependent on natural resource-based exports.
欧洲央行自2012年以来一直竭尽全力阻止主权债务收益率一飞冲天，若非如此，欧元区也将有持久的主权债务违约风险 — — 甚至整个欧盟都会受到动摇��	Without the ECB’s commitment, in place since 2012, to prevent sovereign-debt yields from soaring, there would be a persistent risk to the eurozone – and, indeed, to the entire edifice of the European Union – of sovereign-debt defaults.
尽管使用衍生品的公司减少了它在欧元贬值上的风险暴露，但衍生品实际上带来了新的风险 — — 对手方风险。	Although the company using the derivative reduces its exposure to the risk of a failing euro, the derivative comes packaged with a new risk – counterparty risk.
日本的乱象根源在于房地产和股票泡沫。 1985年的广场协议导致日元升值、损害了日本的出口，因此日本采取了货币扩张刺激内需，结果助长了这些泡沫。	Japan’s woes are rooted in real-estate and equity bubbles, which were fueled by monetary expansion aimed at stimulating domestic demand after the 1985 Plaza Accord drove up the yen’s value and hurt Japan’s exports.
因为看不到通胀迹象，而且经济增长依然温和而脆弱，很多人预计全球经济将长期增长缓慢，有些人甚至担心全球衰退将再次爆发。	With no signs of inflation, and growth still tepid and fragile, many anticipate chronic slow growth, with some even fearing another global recession.
基础设施投资和经济改革对地中海地区的进一步发展无疑至关重要，但如果不同时关注民主、法治、人权和教育，就无法为地区带来变化。	Infrastructural investment and economic reform are crucial for the Mediterranean region’s future development, but they cannot transform the region without a parallel emphasis on democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and education.
克里姆林宫继续支持着叙利亚巴沙尔·阿萨德政权，充当着军事干预的顽固障碍，寻求捍卫其自身的战略利益（包括在叙利亚城市塔尔图斯的海军基地 ） 。	The Kremlin continues to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, maintaining a strict aversion to military intervention and seeking to defend its strategic interests, including its naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus.
与此对照的是，八月末，欧洲央行总裁特里谢谈及危机前做出的货币政策决定来为可能的升息提供理由，然后又维持利率不变。	By contrast, in late August, the ECB’s governor, Jean-Claude Trichet, referred to the monetary-policy decision taken before the crisis to justify the possibility of a rate hike, then left rates on hold.
虽然各方已经经历了数年的复杂协商，但在某些和侵略罪有关的关键事务方面，比如如何取得成员国同意以及如何启动案件方面都依然存在着深层次的不信任。	Despite years of complex negotiations, deep disagreements persist over key issues related to amending the statute on aggression, such as state consent and how cases would be initiated.
而自巴尔干战争结束以来，欧洲大陆的安全问题已不复存在（除了边缘地带，如格鲁吉亚；以及来自近邻，特别是阿拉伯世界的潜在威胁 ） 。	And, since the end of the Balkan wars, the continent’s security problems have disappeared (except at the margins, as in Georgia, or potential threats stemming from its near-abroad, particularly the Arab world).
巴西曾尝试为解决问题起草一项将保护责任授权与武力脱钩的决议 — — 从而有效排除了西方利用这项原则的机率。	Brazil has attempted to address the issue by crafting a resolution that would decouple the R2P mandate from the use of force – effectively eliminating the possibility that the doctrine could be applied.
相反，在发出第一批单词之后不出几个月，两岁的人类儿童就能够造出复杂的、符合语法规则的、主体多样化的句子，这些句子包含动词、名词、介词和限定语。	By contrast, within months of uttering their first words, two-year-old children can produce complex, grammatically correct, and topically diverse sentences comprising verbs, nouns, prepositions, and determiners.
此外，欧洲最大的政治风险依然是民粹主义 — — 而明年的欧洲议会选举将为法国极右翼领导人马林·勒庞提供千载难逢的机会。	Moreover, the biggest political risk in Europe is still populism – and next year’s European parliamentary elections will give the likes of France’s far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, a golden opportunity.
唯一受损的将是25，000个富庶的美国农场主，目前每年价值30到40亿美元的政府补助都被这些人瓜分殆尽。	The only losers would be the 25,000 rich farmers who currently divvy up $3-4 billion in government handouts each year.
民粹主义煽动者趁机大行其道 — — 他们承诺捍卫西方文明、抵抗伊斯兰教、与“布鲁塞尔”做���争、从左派精英手中“夺回”祖国。	That is why populist demagogues – with their promises to defend Western civilization against Islam, fight “Brussels,” and “take back” their countries from the leftist elites – have done so well.
事实上，因为也门与阿富汗和巴基斯坦一样，国家机构软弱而且容易受到操纵，所以，许多伊斯兰圣战分子聚集到了也门，使也门成为伊斯兰圣战分子日益膨胀的根据地。	Indeed, Yemen is now a bubbling cauldron of jihadis who have flocked there because it, like Afghanistan and Pakistan, has weak, easily manipulated state institutions.
因此，在马克龙的第一个五年任期中，他应该聚焦于将法国GDP平均年增长率至少提高到2 % ， 将失业率降低到6%以下。	During Macron’s first five-year term, therefore, he should focus on raising France’s GDP growth to an average of at least 2% a year, and reducing unemployment to below 6%.
迪顿观察到，总体才说西方国家都是在毫无援助的情况下发展起来的（或许二战后美国支援欧洲的马歇尔计划是个例外，但该计划更加集中于重建而非发展 ） 。	Deaton observes that, in general, Western countries developed without receiving any aid. (Perhaps America’s post-World War II Marshall Plan in Europe is an exception, but that aid was intended more for reconstruction than for development.)
其次，该宣言要求所有国家的民众和领袖尽早致力于100%可再生能源及零排放战略，同时认识到无限度追求经济增长并非可行的选择。	Second, the Declaration asks people and leaders from all countries to commit to 100% renewable energy and a zero-emissions strategy as soon as possible, and to recognize that unlimited economic growth is not a viable option.
纽约 — — 最新报告显示，美国第三季度GDP增长3.5 % ， 说明自大萧条以来最严重的衰退已经结束，尽管如此，美国经济实际上比数据所显示的情况差得多。	NEW YORK – While the United States recently reported 3.5% GDP growth in the third quarter, suggesting that the most severe recession since the Great Depression is over, the American economy is actually much weaker than official data suggest.
结果就是，不仅仅是卢武铉悲剧性的自杀和金正日无用的炮火。 日益增长的朝鲜族内部国家的对立斗争会最终危及整个朝鲜族人民的安全。	As a result, growing inter-Korean hostility may ultimately prove far more lethal to the well-being of all Koreans than Roh Moo-hyun’s tragic suicide and Kim Jong-il’s futile fireworks.
例子包括1492年犹太人被驱逐出西班牙；1685年胡格诺教派被驱逐出法国；二战后德国人和其他人被驱逐出东欧；1948年一些巴勒斯坦人被驱逐出以色列；20世纪70年代印度人被驱逐出乌干达等。	Examples include the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, of Huguenots from France in 1685, of Germans and others from Eastern Europe following WWII, of some Palestinians from Israel in 1948, and of Indians from Uganda in the 1970s.
摩尔多瓦的现任政府，欧洲一体化联盟若不是见证了俄罗斯之前如何对待所谓亲西方的格鲁吉亚和乌克兰政府的话，将更加亲近欧洲。	Moldova’s current government, the Alliance for European Integration, might be a lot more pro-European if it had not seen how Russia treated supposedly pro-Western governments in Georgia and Ukraine before it.
问题是，制造业在创造就业机会方面贡献甚小，主要是因为该行业生产率增长较快 — — 过去二十年间年均10％以上 — — 因而限制更多的劳动力需求。	The problem is that the manufacturing sector does little to create jobs, largely because relatively high productivity growth in the sector – averaging more than 10% annually over the last two decades – constrains demand for more workers.
现在你就不得不在被人得到荣誉之前马上发表你的整个理论。 这把你搞得很惨，但是你还是在第二年年底以前出版了书，但只不过是你所计划的巨著的摘要。	Now you have to publish your entire theory right away, before someone else gets the credit. It nearly kills you, but you get the book out – only an abstract of the magnum opus that you had planned – by the end of the next year.
IMF总裁拉加德（Christine Lagarde）对《爱尔兰时报 》 （ Irish Times）表示 ： “ 债务就是债务，它是契约。	As IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told the Irish Times: “A debt is a debt, and it is a contract.
举例来讲，欧洲的痼疾 — — 部分因领导人拒绝寻求全面方案而坚持得过且过才长期存在 — — 已经为濒临崩溃的乌克兰带来了严重后果。	For example, Europe’s malaise – which has persisted partly because its leaders have insisted on muddling through, rather than seeking comprehensive solutions – has had serious consequences for Ukraine, a country teetering on the edge of a meltdown.
届时57个伊斯兰会议组织成员国的GDP总量（目前只占全球的13 % ） 将在未来几十年内轻易翻一番。	As a result, the combined GDP of the 57-member Organization of the Islamic Conference nations – now only about 13% of global output – will easily double in the coming decades.
解放这一信息宝藏能扩大统计样本，达到接近普查的规模；提高它们的及时性和准确性；并降低企业和家庭的回应成本。	Unlocking this trove of information would extend statistical samples to near-census size, increase their timeliness and accuracy, and reduce the respondent costs to businesses and households.
事实上，尽管退欧派争取到大多数愤怒的工人阶级白人选民，但对贸易持友好态度的中产阶级退欧派加上“留欧”派显然占了6月公投中的绝大多数。	In fact, despite Leave’s large faction of angry white working-class voters, middle-class trade-friendly Brexiteers, together with the “Remain” camp, constitute a clear majority of everyone who voted in the June referendum.
比如在AIG，美银，花旗以及房利美的救助中，公司的债券持有人全部受到照顾，可是公司的股东则损失惨重。	A government may wish to bail out a financial institution and provide protection to its creditors for two reasons.
奥巴马政府在就任伊始就全面陷入了墨西哥禁毒战争，目前正面临着在华盛顿几乎从未触及的种种危险，人们要了解这些危险只有从墨西哥发来的外交电报中。	Obama plunged into Mexico’s drug war at the outset of his administration, and now faces perils that are barely touched upon in Washington, except in cables originating in Mexico.
之后中国人同意在今年夏天开始进口美国牛肉，并解除多年来一直执行的多项保护主义政策，还同意对美国一系列金融服务开放市场。	After that, the Chinese agreed to start importing US beef this summer, rescinding protectionist policies that had been in place for several years. China also agreed to open its market to a range of US financial services.
哪里的社会保障部门资源匮乏、权力虚弱、或缺少合乎要求的人员配置，哪里就无法落实提供充足的医疗、教育和住宅的基本权利。	Where social ministries are under-resourced, disempowered, or lack qualified staff, basic rights to adequate health care, education, and housing will remain unfulfilled.
人类社会乘坐私人飞车从城市上空掠过的梦想一直吸引着电影制作者的想象力 — — 现在甚至吸引了某些投资者加入其中。	Society’s enduring dream of whizzing over a city in private flying cars has long captured the imagination of filmmakers – and now even some investors.
有些罗马尼亚官员，包括总统特拉扬·伯塞斯库，一直在讨论向占总人口四分之一的多达百万摩尔多瓦公民颁发罗马尼亚护照。	Some Romanian officials, including President Traian Basescu, have bandied about the idea of distributing Romanian passports to as many as a million Moldovan citizens, a quarter of the entire population.
该指数指的是人们在被问到 ： “ 如果道琼��指数明天下跌3 % ， 我认为后天道琼斯指数会：上涨？	The index is the share of people who answered “increase” to the question, “If the Dow dropped 3% tomorrow, I would guess that the day after tomorrow the Dow would: Increase?
中国从这些措施中所得到的好处，很有可能大大低于贸易战升级所造成的损失 — — 特别是在欧盟已经安全，而中国需要独自面对美国的时候。	Whatever benefit China derives from such measures may well be outweighed by an escalating trade war– especially now that the EU is safe and China will have to face the US alone.
4月11日，G-7外长在广岛宣布“所有国家都不应该进行核试爆，所有国家都应该毫不迟疑地签署并批准CTBT ” ， 这是一个良好的开端。	The G-7 foreign ministers’ declaration on April 11 in Hiroshima – “No state should conduct a nuclear test explosion and all states should sign and ratify the CTBT without delay” – is a good start.
此外，这个话题仍是高度敏感的：尽管2012年的民调第一次显示微弱多数支持合法化，但反对声音仍然很激烈。	Moreover, the topic remains highly sensitive: while public-opinion polls in 2012 indicate for the first time a small majority in favor of legalization, opponents remain vehement.
高得惊人的青年失业率、不断缩水的社会安全网和基础设施/人力资本投资不足正加重着当前一代人的负担，且在越来越多的情况下，也将会有害于未来一代人。	Alarmingly high youth unemployment, shrinking social safety nets, and under-investment in infrastructure and human capital are burdening current generations and, in a growing number of cases, will adversely affect future generations as well.
“我们办理的所有在押人员案件都必须服从于一个保护令 ， ” 迪克松说 ， “ 在这个保护令之下，囚犯所说的每一句话都是机密 ” ， 除非国防部“特权小组”另有决定。	“We are subject in all detainee cases to a protective order,” Dixon says. “Under this order, everything the detainee says is classified,” unless the Department of Defense “Privilege Team” decides otherwise.
他们的应对策略包括买入外汇以防止本币升值又或者采取资金管制，在某些极端的案例中甚至完全禁止货币流入。	Their reactions range from buying up the foreign money to prevent currency appreciation to adopting capital controls, and, in extreme cases, to keeping the money out altogether.
但是，由于候选人需要受到由亲中派担任委员的非选举产生的委员会的仔细审查，实际上公民可以说完全没有选择。	But, given that candidates are to be carefully vetted by an unelected committee of pro-Chinese appointees, citizens would have no meaningful choice at all.
令人瞩目的是，墨西哥畸高的不平等程度从1994年开始下降，这在很大程度上要归功于社会政策改革和教育进步。	Remarkably, Mexico’s exceedingly high levels of inequality have begun to fall since 1994, thanks in large part to reforms in social policy and educational improvements.
（而且也许还需要投资于让垃圾食品失去吸引力，提高营养食品便利性并降低其价格 — — 甚至为其提供补助。 ）	(And perhaps it requires investment in, say, making bad food unappealing, if only by making good food cheaper – or even subsidized – and more convenient.)
页岩气燃烧时还会释放二氧化碳，尽管页岩气比煤炭的含碳量低一半，并且对美国将碳排放量减至20世纪90年代中期水平居功至伟。	And shale gas emits CO2 when burned, even though it has half the carbon content of coal and has played a significant role in cutting US carbon emissions to mid-1990’s levels.
艾利森将中国和美国代入其中，并将书起名为《注定的战争 》 （ Destined for War ） 。	Allison portrays China and the US in these roles, and calls his book Destined for War.
全新一代全球青年 — — 从孟买到布拉格、肯尼亚和新加坡 — — 正在蜂拥涌向创新，以廉价融资为支撑的美国风险资本基金正在海外大肆满足其投资胃口。	A bright generation of global youth – from Mumbai to Prague to Kenya to Singapore – is betting on innovation, and American venture capital funds, sustained by access to cheap financing, are sating their investment appetites overseas.
而来自美国和“巴基斯坦之友”联盟（欧盟，中国和日本）的财政资助也非常重要，但当涉及到发展项目的投资实效性时，巴基斯坦的历史纪录却并不光彩。	Financial pledges from the US and the “Friends of Pakistan” consortium (the European Union, China, and Japan) are important, but when it comes to investing wisely in development projects, Pakistan’s track record is nothing to be proud of.
Expedia、Yelp和TripAdvisor这样的企业提出谷歌搜索抢走了他们网站有价值的流量，导致他们的企业在竞争中陷入不劣势。	Companies like Expedia, Yelp, and TripAdvisor argue that Google searches are depriving their Web sites of valuable traffic, putting their businesses at a disadvantage.
比方说，莱因哈特和罗格夫可能故意对自己的研究成果轻描淡写（他们实际也是这样做的 ） ， 以防止它们被赤字鹰派所利用。	For example, Reinhart and Rogoff might have downplayed their results – such as they were – in order to prevent them from being misused by deficit hawks.
今天的感觉是美国的单极时代已经结束；欧洲走向衰落；一系列新强国正在崛起，它们的独特世界观正在左右全球事务。	The perception today is that America’s unipolar moment has come to an end; Europe is on the decline; and a new set of powers is rising, bringing their own unique worldviews to global affairs.
其支持者所提出的更现实的理由包括这会激起人们对欧洲身份的认同感、成立单一欧洲央行可以作为各国政府移交权力的先声等。	More realistically, advocates of a single currency reasoned that it would cause people to identify as Europeans, and that the shift to a single European Central Bank would herald a shift of power away from national governments.
一方面，中国的经济革命帮助中国找到了自己在世界上的位置：可靠的贸易强国，更有责任感的全球权力代理，甚至是令人放心的军事力量。	On one hand, China’s economic revolution has helped position it in the world as a confident powerhouse of trade, a more responsible global powerbroker, and even as a reassuring military presence.
但是减少农业补贴会造成食品价格的上升，至少在一开始会这样，而单单降低农业关税在没有配套政策的支持下并不一定能使发展中国家的食品产量出现上升。	However, cutting farm subsidies will increase food prices, at least initially, while reducing agricultural tariffs alone will not necessarily lead to an increase in food production in poor countries without complementary support.
有一点是肯定的：经济学家不再敢认为趋势就是趋势，周期就是周期，它们发生交错的情况很少，可以忽略不计。	One thing is clear: economists no longer dare to assume that trend is trend and cycle is cycle, and that their reciprocal interactions are small enough to neglect on the first pass.
阿姆斯特丹—在今年大部分时间里，投资者一直关注着美联储何时“升空 ” — —即何时将利率提高25个基点（或0.25 % ） ，作为迈向货币条件正常化的第一步。	AMSTERDAM – For much of the year, investors have been fixated on when the Fed will achieve “liftoff” – that is, when it will raise interest rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25%, as a first step toward normalizing monetary conditions.
与此同时，投资者开始认识到，关注气候风险是合理投资战略的一个组成部分，可以最大限度地降低风险并有助于提升金融稳健程度。	At the same time, investors are starting to understand that paying attention to climate risk is an integral part of a sound investment strategy that seeks to minimize risk and help to promote financial stability.
因为金正日真正想要的并非和平，而是所谓“和平攻势 ” — —某种自1953年停战以来就屡试不爽的伎俩，目的就是为了破坏和瓦解对方阵营的团结。	For what Kim is now offering is not peace, but a “peace offensive” – a tactic used by the North repeatedly since the armistice of 1953 in order to sow division whenever the regime’s adversaries have demonstrated unity and resolve.
但是，只有欧洲重新树立信心并且发挥积极的作用，这一时刻才有可能。 而这一作用必须与美国协力，而非与之作对。	But that can happen only if the EU regains its confidence and steps into a positive role – one that it must play with, not against, the US.
但德国年轻人对大屠杀的记忆已经日渐模糊，再加上以色列国际形象的破坏，这些构成了两国“特殊”关系的官方定性的挑战。	But fading memories of the Holocaust among younger Germans, together with Israel’s declining international standing, have lately challenged the official discourse about “special” ties between the two countries.
炮制和散播假新闻的匿名政治爱好者和社交黑客（social hacker）的“根据地”是Reddit。	Many of the anonymous political hobbyists and social hackers who are creating and disseminating fake news do so on Reddit.
和1962年美国的大气层核试验一样，中国的测试对空间环境具有极大的破坏力，制造出一大片无差别致命碎片区。	China’s test, like the US atmospheric nuclear test in 1962, was highly damaging to the space environment, creating a vast, indiscriminate, and lethal debris field.
反紧缩反对票在政府无法有效实施改革的国家（如希腊）最多，而葡萄牙和西班牙正好相反，它们的经济正在强劲的出口的带动下复苏。	The anti-austerity protest vote is strongest where governments have been unable to implement reforms effectively (for example, in Greece), in contrast to Portugal and Spain, whose economies are recovering on the back of strong exports.
与库克不同，从前，除了没有出柜，我还是女人和内向者，我的政治学总是与我在男性外向者主导的职业中的同事不同。	Unlike Cook, in addition to being closeted, I was a woman and an introvert, and my politics tended to differ from those of my peers in my heavily male, extrovert-dominated profession.
他们赞同强硬派印度教沙文主义者和人民党议员苏格特·桑姆（Sugeet Som）上个月的说法，称泰姬陵是“印度文化的一个污点 ” ， “由叛徒所建造 ” ， “不应在印度历史上占据任何地位 ” 。	They agree with the hardline Hindu chauvinist and BJP legislator Sangeet Som, who last month called the Taj Mahal “a blot on Indian culture” that had been “built by traitors” and “should have no place in Indian history.”
1997年，克斯坦扎（Robert Costanza）及其同事所撰写的开创性论文推算海洋生态系统功能的总价值为21万亿美元。	Back in 1997, a pioneering paper by Robert Costanza and his colleagues put the overall value of marine ecosystem services at $21 trillion.
有关宗教和科学的丑陋辩论通常看似局限在美国。 但是，最近几个月来，这场辩论开始蔓延，首先到欧洲，然后遍布全球。	Ugly debates about religion and science usually seem to be confined to the United States. In recent months, however, such debates have begun to spread – first to Europe and then around the world.
直到今年春天，大多数的观察家都还认为，美元在国际储备中所占的比重将逐渐下滑，欧元的比重将上升，而全世界将平缓地过渡到一种多元储备的格局。	Until this spring, most observers had assumed that the share of the dollar in international reserves would gradually fall, while that of the euro would rise, and that the world would gradually and smoothly make a transition to a multi-reserve regime.
左派对该协议抱有坚定不移的敌意 — — 其理由常常是美国国会在谈判期间一直对内容一无所知 — — 这带曾经来了两大危险。	The left’s unremitting hostility to the deal – often on the grounds that the US Congress was kept in the dark about its content during negotiations – carried two dangers.
进入可再生能源发电领域的投资比重稳步上升，2011年已从短短四年前占投资总额的32%上升至占投资总额的50 % 。	The share of energy investment going into renewable electric generation has increased steadily, reaching 50% in 2011, up from 32% just four years before.
迪拜 — — 2013年12月，诺贝尔物理学奖得主彼得·希格斯在接受卫报采访时表示，如果他今天在学术界求职 ， “ 我恐怕不会被认为是最高效的 。 ”	DUBAI – In December 2013, the Nobel laureate physicist Peter Higgs told The Guardian that if he were seeking a job in academia today, “I don’t think I would be regarded as productive enough.”
或者，欧洲愿意忍痛采取“内部”贬值的方式 — — 这种方式在过去在黄金标准体系下曾经惨遭失败，而在如今在欧元体系也下日趋崩溃？	Alternatively, are they willing to face the pain of “internal” devaluation, a process that failed under the gold standard and is failing under the euro?
台湾也应当被允许在核安全方面参与国际原子能组织的活动，正如在1990年代SARS和禽流感肆虐期间被接纳成为世界卫生组织观察员那样。	Taiwan should also be allowed to participate in the International Atomic Energy Agency in the area of nuclear safety, just as it became an observer at the World Health Organization during the SARS and avian flu pandemics of the 1990’s.
相反，妇女必须找到在当地获得粮食和为家庭创收的替代手段，比如出售小额资产甚至让孩子提前退学提供帮助。	Instead, women must find alternative means of securing food locally and of generating income to support their families, such as selling small assets or even withdrawing their children from school to help.
我们的合作 — — 其中包括思科投资1亿美元于法国初创企业 — — 能够改变能源管理、医疗和教育，从而刺激法国的经济竞争力、就业创造、活力和增长。	The collaboration, which includes a $100 million investment from Cisco in French startups, could transform energy management, health care, and education – boosting France's economic competitiveness, job creation, dynamism, and growth in the process.
最后谈谈乔治·W·布什这样的政治家的例子，他们颁布政府方案，向年长者许诺综合药物福利，向制药公司承诺巨大利润。	Finally, there is the example of politicians like George W. Bush, who enacted a government program that promises comprehensive drug benefits to the elderly and mammoth profits to pharmaceutical companies.
据IMF研究，到2021年，美国净投资头寸可能会进一步恶化 — — 预计净负债从占GDP的41%上升到63 % — —而中国净投资头寸盈余将基本保持不变。	According to the IMF, by 2021, the US net investment position will probably deteriorate – with net liabilities rising from of 41% of GDP to 63% – while China’s net investment position remains flat.
世界银行集团为二十国集团所准备的背景资料指出，政府应该花更大的力气用于遴选、筛选和管理基础设施项目，并更多地致力于基本投资气候质量问题。	As a background note prepared by the World Bank Group for the G-20 explains, governments should pay more attention to the selection, quality, and management of infrastructure projects, as well as to the quality of the underlying investment climate.
据瑞士信贷（Credit Suisse）的一份年度报告，46个主要经济体中有35个财富不平等性正在急剧恶化，而2007年之前只有12个。	According to an annual Credit Suisse report, wealth inequality is now growing sharply in 35 of 46 major economies, compared to just 12 before 2007.
但现实却远没有那么险恶：在伊拉克战争中，美以委员会仅仅是利用了乔治·W·布什总统扮演救世主的冲动和切尼副总统单枪匹马的战争游说所掀起的侵略狂潮。	But the reality is far less sinister: in that case, AIPAC merely surfed on the pro-invasion wave unleashed by President George W. Bush, with his Messianic urges, and Vice President Dick Cheney, a one-man war lobby.
在本周在尼日利亚首都阿布贾举行的世界经济论坛上，我和来自商界和公民社会的同仁一道提出了一个保证存在切实紧迫的威胁的地区的学生人生安全的计划。	At the World Economic Forum in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, this week, together with partners from business and civil society, I launched a program to ensure the personal safety of children in areas where the threats to them are real and immediate.
格鲁吉亚出现的危机表明，在俄罗斯有重大的战略利益和压倒性军事力量的地区，想要影响该地区的事态进展，我们的能力是有限的。	As the Georgian crisis has underscored, there are limits to the ability to influence developments in a region where Russia has strong strategic interests and a preponderance of military power.
事实上，认识到个人数据是个人资产的企业将更有利地建立与个体消费者的关系，从而更深度地了解消费者的具体需要和渴望。	Indeed, firms that acknowledge that personal data are personal property will be in a better position to build relationships with individual consumers, thereby gaining deeper insights into their specific needs and desires.
其后果已经开始显露：据2016年彭博创新指数，美国现在是世界上创新力第八的国家，比2015年的排名下降了两位。	The consequences are already starting to show: according to the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index, the US is now the world’s eighth most innovative country, having fallen two spots since 2015.
这些进步将让我们能够养活2050年的预计人口 — — 九十亿人，并为他们提供电力 — — 以更小的经济和环境成本实现。	These advances will enable us to feed and provide power – at a lower economic and environmental cost – to the anticipated 2050 population of nine billion people.
整个欧洲社会模式的多元化，以及就共同规则达成一致的困难性，将成为一体化的节奏和范围的天然“刹车 ” 。	The diversity of social models across Europe, and the difficulty of reaching agreement on common rules, would have acted as a natural brake on the pace and scope of integration.
随着社会保障系统和主权基金这样的公有实体持有更加多样化的资产组合，也就会大大减少偏袒国家持有较多份额的已有企业的市场干涉行为。	With public entities like the social security system and sovereign-wealth funds holding more diversified asset portfolios, incentives would be substantially reduced for market intervention favoring incumbents in which the state owned a large share.
事实上，我最近遇到的一位年轻的北京创业家估计，现在至少有20%的中国人 — — 超过2.5亿人 — — 每年的收入超过40,000美元。	In fact, a young Beijing-based entrepreneur I met recently estimates that at least 20% of Chinese – over 250 million people – are now making $40,000 per year.
在出现避险情绪的情况下，拥有大量美元计价负债的新兴市场和发达经济体金融部门将不无法最终求助于美联储。	In the case of a risk-off, emerging markets and advanced-economy financial sectors with massive dollar-denominated liabilities will no longer have access to the Fed as a lender of last resort.
化学和生物化学同样拥有坚实的基础¾虽然人体内还有我们未知的领域，但普遍的看法是我们已经掌握了细胞和分子反应的基本方法。	Chemistry and biochemistry are similarly solid -- there are some things we don’t understand about the body, but it is believed that the basic machinery of how cells and molecules interact is known.
发自香港 — — 今年三月，G20集团、全国人大以及多个智库机构召开的会议都表明，全球各方已经逐渐意识到了由通缩压力和金融不稳定性增强所导致的全球经济风险。	HONG KONG – In March, meetings of the G-20, the Chinese National People’s Congress, and multiple think tanks all reflected a growing awareness of the risks to the global economy posed by deflation and intensifying financial instability.
虽然我们不能期望Mailat奇迹般转世再生，但我们能够也必须要求对和他一样的边缘人群的情况进行彻底评估。	Although we cannot expect a miraculous reincarnation of the criminal Mailat, we can and must ask for a radical review of the situation that marginalized people like him face.
民主刚果红十字会的一份 最新评估警告说，流离失所人数将继续增加，且该地区还受到传播迅速的霍乱疫情的威胁，急需协调行动计划。	A recent assessment by the Red Cross Society of the DRC warns that the number of people displaced will continue to rise, and with a fast-spreading cholera outbreak threatening the region, a coordinated plan of action is urgently needed.
毫无疑问，适用于不同病例的检测和治疗方案各有不同，但对于频繁的筛查来说，另一个要注意的地方就是假阳性的问题。	Naturally, individual cases dictate which tests and treatments are best, but an additional concern about frequent screenings is the problem of false positives.
斯德哥尔摩—来自北约多国的军用车队在瑞典西部港口卸货，蜂拥驶入瑞典的街道，让警方不得不发布交通警告。	STOCKHOLM – Having debarked from ports in western Sweden, military convoys from various NATO countries are crowding Swedish streets and prompting the police to issue traffic warnings.
这不是“因为预算委员会应顾不暇 … … （而是）参众两院 … … 漠然置之 … … （因为）他们不想采取行动 。 ”	This is not “because the budget committees are too busy....[T]he House and Senate...are not doing much of anything...[because] they don't want to.”
伦敦—如果说要寻找什么信号证明欧盟正在以令人警惕的速度分崩离析的话，匈牙利沿着其与同为欧盟成员国的克罗地亚的边境修建铁丝网隔离障就是这样的信号。	LONDON – If a clear signal was needed that the European Union is falling apart at an alarming rate, Hungary’s construction of razor-wire fences along the border with its fellow EU member Croatia is it.
换句话说，经济回报的摆锤已经彻底偏离了劳动者而摆向资本所有者一方 — — 这对那些鼓吹要将美国企业从所谓重压下解放出来的人来说可不是个好论据。	In other words, the pendulum of economic returns has swung decisively away from labor toward owners of capital – not exactly a compelling argument in favor of relief for purportedly hard-pressed American businesses.
对加密货币的正确认识应该是将其视为能在一个反乌托邦的未来中给予你回报的彩票，比如在那些流氓和失败国家或是公民已经失去所有隐私的国家内使用。	The right way to think about cryptocurrency coins is as lottery tickets that pay off in a dystopian future where they are used in rogue and failed states, or perhaps in countries where citizens have already lost all semblance of privacy.
为了支撑这一观点，他引用了“弗林效应 ” — —哲学家詹姆斯·弗林（James Flynn）的一项重大发现：自从智商（IQ）首次进行测试以来，人们的得分取得了相当大的提升。	In support of this claim, he refers to the “Flynn Effect” – the remarkable finding by the philosopher James Flynn that since IQ tests were first administered, scores have risen considerably.
唯一的希望是出现一场促使立刻行动的国际运动，比如像在哥本哈根会议前那样迫使世界最大碳排放国 — — 包括美国和中国 — — 给出排放目标。	The only hope is an international movement for immediate action, such as that which, in advance of the Copenhagen conference, compelled the world’s largest carbon emitters – including the United States and China – to set emissions targets.
因此，中国行政改革的真正考验是当局能否通过改进破产制度和阻止欺诈及市场操纵的监管，让市场力量能够真正主导资源配置。	That is why the real test of China’s administrative reforms is whether, through improved bankruptcy mechanisms and regulations that block fraud and market manipulation, they allow – and even facilitate – the effective functioning of market forces.
诺贝尔经济学奖得主安格斯·迪顿（Angus Deaton）指出 ， “ 疯狂的是，一些全球化反对者忘记了十亿人主要因为全球化而摆脱了贫困 。 ”	As the Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton argues, “what is crazy is that some of the opponents of globalization forget that a billion people have come out of poverty largely because of globalization.”
这也是巴林的什叶多数派爆发阿拉伯春天运动后沙特将军队调动到巴林的原因之一 — — 这也解释了美国在吸取伊拉克教训后，为什么默许沙特实施这样的举动。	This is one reason why the Kingdom moved troops into Bahrain when Arab Spring protests by the country’s Shia majority erupted – and why America, having learned its lesson in Iraq, gave its tacit consent.
但这种对工作人口征收适度税率的同时为退休人员提供舒适生活条件的做法要求纳税人数量要远大于养老金领取者。	But providing benefits to support a comfortable standard of living for retirees with just a modest rate of tax on the working population depends on there being a small number of pensioners relative to the number of taxpayers.
但因为和平特别管辖条款涉及的某些高级军界、商界和政界人物涉嫌与右翼准军事组织有染，这些人现在已经被哥伦比亚参议院免职。	Colombia’s Senate, however, has now removed from the JEP’s jurisdiction high-ranking military, business, and political figures suspected of colluding with the right-wing paramilitaries.
其中一些群体，如目前执政的人民党（PP ） ， 逐渐转向了中间道路，成为比较典型的保守派欧洲政党，就像英国保守党和德国基督教民主联盟。	Some, like the now-ruling People’s Party (PP), have over time shifted toward the center to become more typical conservative European parties, much like the UK’s Conservatives or Germany’s Christian Democratic Union.
“哪怕对这个问题有一点点关注的人也能轻松看出…这套制度的明显优势…社会各阶层共同和平努力；社会主义组织及其活动因此受到抑制 。 ”	“Anyone who gives even slight attention to the matter will easily see…the obvious advantages in the system….The various classes work together peacefully; socialist organizations and their activities are repressed.”
尽管众所周知汇率的不可预测的，但是大家预言美国庞大的贸易赤字的缓慢冲销将使美元从长期来看会逐渐下跌。	Though exchange rates are notoriously unpredictable, the best guess is that a slow unwinding of the massive US trade deficit will keep the dollar on a path of gradual long-term decline.
从加拿大东北部阿尔伯塔省阿塔巴斯卡油砂公司向得州海湾炼油厂运送石油的拱心石XL输油管道计划引发的夸张争论就是实例。	Consider the hyperbolic debate over the Keystone XL pipeline, which would funnel oil from Canada’s Athabasca tar sands in northeastern Alberta to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast.
60年代、70年代和80年代，大规模民权斗争磨刀霍霍向种族歧视和种族隔离，此后则是主张残疾人和性小众（sexual minorities）权利的斗争。	In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, great civil-rights battles were waged against racial discrimination and apartheid, followed by struggles to advance the rights of the disabled and sexual minorities.
无论上述状况是否合理，这样的企业都加剧了收入不平等的上升 — — 进而造成制度绑架、媒体偏见和对选举不可忽视的影响。	Whether or not that is justified, such companies’ contribution to rising income inequality – and thus to regulatory capture, media bias, and disproportionate influence in elections – cannot be ignored.
"对于乌克兰象征和地位的共同见解很大程度上来源于这样一个共识：那就是成立典型的民族国家，也就是""单一的乌克兰国家""无法很好地维护独立。"	"These shared attitudes toward Ukrainian symbols and statehood owe much to a recognition that independence will not be well protected by forging a classic nation state, that is, a ""Ukrainian Only"" state."
接下来就是武装分子对救援人员长达数小时的折磨，羞辱，用点燃的手榴弹进行的威胁，对着我们一个同事的脚的开枪射击，以及对国际救援委员会所在地的抢劫和掠夺。	What followed were many hours of harassment, humiliation, threats with live hand grenades, shots fired at the feet of one of our colleagues, and looting and ransacking of the IRC premises.
相反，这两个互相矛盾的叙事制造了一个恶性循环，助长了敌意，导致了希腊左翼政府赢得选举。 该政府身负反对紧缩的使命 — — 这给双方都会带来灾难性影响。	Instead, these clashing narratives created a deleterious spiral, fanning the flames of animosity and leading to the election of a left-wing government in Greece with a mandate to oppose austerity – with disastrous results for both sides.
但如果现在嘲笑疾控中心的立法者过去几年注意到CDC的求助和资金不足的后果警示，也许今天美国就不会发生这样的事件。	However, had the same lawmakers who are now deriding the CDC listened to pleas for more support and warnings of the consequences of poor funding over the past several years, perhaps the US would not be in the situation in which it finds itself today.
但韩国等国家正在感受中国崛起的压力 — — 中国单方面扩大其放空区所引起的愤怒即是明证 — — 它们将会有热烈的反应。	But countries like South Korea that are feeling the pressure of China’s rise – as demonstrated by the current furor over China’s unilateral expansion of its air defense zone – may well reciprocate such an effort.
而由于90％的底层人士收入增长已经停滞了将近1/3个世纪（且其中很大比例都出现了下滑 ） ， 医疗数据清晰明白地证实了美国大部分地区处境不妙。	But, with the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for very large swaths of the country.
与此同时，类似的丑闻也导致匈牙利和斯洛伐克自由政治家下台，上述两国现在均由欧盟内部最为亲俄的政府实际掌控。	At the same time, similar scandals removed liberal politicians from power in Hungary and Slovakia, which are now ruled by the most pro-Russian governments in the EU.
从1998到1999年普京担任联邦安全局主席时上述进程就已经开始，当时秘密警察的控制权牢牢掌握在他的手中。	The process began during his tenure as chairman of the Federal Security Service, from 1998 to 1999, when he wielded control over the secret police.
鉴于瑞士在富足、教育程度高、创新能力强和适应性好等方面享有盛誉，它在指数中排名居前可能没有什么值得大惊小怪的。	Given Switzerland’s reputation for being wealthy, well educated, innovative, and resilient, its success in the index may not seem surprising.
可我们都知道这些国家和它们的央行有能力在数月之内耗费数万亿美元的巨资来救助它们在经济运行平稳时赚取了超额利润的银行。	But we all know that these countries and their national banks were able to spend trillions of dollars in a few months to bail out their bankers, who earned super-profits when the going was good.
如果如果劳动者无法自由流动的话，财政转移支付就是欧元区缓解债务偿付压力，以及通过刺激经济活动来促进就业的唯一选项。	Without free labor mobility, fiscal transfers are the eurozone’s only option to ease debt repayment and, by stimulating economic activity, boost employment.
类似地，为了捍卫个人不能因为追溯法被判有罪的美国司法原则，塔夫特（Robert Taft）谴责纽伦堡审判，尽管他憎恨纳粹。	Similarly, Robert Taft denounced the Nuremberg Trials, despite his hatred of the Nazis, to defend the fundamental US legal principle that a person could not be criminally charged on the basis of a retroactive statute.
但阿拉伯国家组建联合军队又带来另一个安全隐患：这样的联盟将对地区产生何种影响，尤其考虑到今天不断加剧的逊尼-什叶派分裂？	But, as some Arab countries move to establish a joint military force, another security question is emerging: Will such an alliance leave the region better or worse off, particularly given today’s growing Sunni-Shia divide?
利率的上升会让他们面对现实：购房的贷款利息将会占家庭预算的更大一部分，这是我们最终必须面对的严峻现实。	Interest rate increases will deliver a fresh dose of reality: the interest expense of owning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budgets, a hard fact that will eventually sink into our thinking.
此外，乌克兰在1994年交出核武器时，美国（英国、法国和俄国）当时都明确表态将保障乌克兰的领土完整。	Moreover, when Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons in 1994, it did so with the express understanding that the US (and the United Kingdom, France, and Russia) would guarantee its territorial integrity.
我想说的是，坏经济学让坏政治学更有可能从边缘走入主流，就像1928—1930年间的德国民族社会主义。	What I will say is that bad economics makes it more likely that bad politics will move from the fringes into the mainstream, as German National Socialism did between 1928 and 1930.
比方说位于北京东南的城市天津，其当前GDP几乎堪与斯德哥尔摩相媲美 — — 而到2025年甚至可能相当于整个瑞典的规模。	They are places like Tianjin, a city southeast of Beijing with a GDP that is practically on par with Stockholm’s today – and could equal all of Sweden’s by 2025.
《卫生事务 》 （ Health Affairs）杂志2月号发表一篇新研究的表明还有一个选择：在很多例子中，医疗成本可以通过预防免除，即广泛使用平价疫苗。	A new study, published in February in the journal Health Affairs, suggests that there is another option: in many cases, the medical bills can be preempted by prevention, through the widespread and affordable use of vaccines.
现在，应该有一个效仿法国总统马克龙的“共和国前进 ” （ La République En Marche）的新政党，利用老牌政党的分裂、混乱和失信。	Now is the moment for a new party, styled after French President Emmanuel Macron’s “La République En Marche,” to capitalize on the division, disarray, and distrust in the established parties.
国家的现任领导人被指犯下了战争罪，这还是第一次。 全世界的反应主要分做两种：有些人欢呼这一举措是向着国际正义迈出的一大步，还有些人指责这是殖民主义。	This is the first time that a sitting head of state has been indicted for war crimes, with reaction around the world mainly divided between those who hailed the move as a great step for international justice and those who condemned it as colonialism.
如果法国人没有招募他，他就会加入圣战组织：在哪都不重要，只要能让他觉得自己手握权力，并找到一个纵容其暴力冲动的理由就行了。	The army turned him down because of his criminal record. If the French wouldn’t have him, he would join the holy warriors: anything to give him a sense of power and an excuse to indulge his violent impulses.
举个例子，限制公共开支增长率（势头）可以作为债务标准的一个补充，这个增长率不允许超过国内生产总值限定的百分比。	The debt criterion, for example, could be supplemented by a limit on the (trend) growth rate of public spending, which would be kept below that of nominal GDP.
首先，由于基因组通过复制大量增长和传播，修改全部基因组只需要修改有限数量的个体，特别是对于生命周期较短的生命体而言。	For starters, because genomes multiply and spread with reproduction, modifying an entire population would require modifications to only a limited number of individuals, especially if the organism’s lifecycle is short.
除了北约（虽然它正处于低潮期，但仍然十分重要 ） ， 谈判中的跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系提供了形成基于规则的国际秩序的好机会。	Beyond NATO, which remains important even at a low ebb, the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership offers a potent opportunity to shape a rule-based international order.
柏林 — — 慢慢地，人们开始认为（即使德国人也是如此 ） ， 金融危机可能破坏欧洲统一前景，因为这场危机残酷地显示了欧元区及其基础的脆弱性。	BERLIN – Slowly, word is getting round – even in Germany – that the financial crisis could destroy the European unification project in its entirety, because it demonstrates, quite relentlessly, the weaknesses of the eurozone and its construction.
因此，尽管有着反犹太和反西方布道的尴尬历史，但21世纪葛兰运动追随者仍成功树立了民间社会运动形象，与土耳其自由派有着共同的价值观和愿望。	Thus, despite Gülen’s own embarrassing history of anti-Semitic and anti-Western sermons, his followers managed to establish themselves by the 2000s as a civil-society movement that shared Turkish liberals’ values and aspirations.
他们要的是 — — 对煤炭业来说，这是个不行的消息 — — 清洁、廉价的能源，让他们能够在不破坏未来的情况下现在就获得电力。	And what they want – unfortunately for the coal industry – is clean, affordable energy that powers their present, without costing them their future.
议会已经能够掌握更大的权力，因为它是欧洲唯一的能对欧盟的政策建议提出质疑和挑战的机制，也能熨平布鲁塞尔官场上有时出现的笨拙的高压式命令。	The parliament has been able to claw greater power for itself because it is the only mechanism Europe has for questioning and challenging EU policy proposals, and ironing out the sometimes clumsy and high-handed diktats of Brussels’ officialdom.
但如果能够不断取得成功，将给未来领导人提供很有价值的经验，让他们了解私人部门的合理作用（不光是在印度，也包括全世界 ） 。	But if they continue to be a success, they will provide valuable lessons for future leaders about the proper role of the private sector not just in India, but around the world.
毕竟，沙漠化和森林采伐促成了二十多年前秘鲁的毛泽东主义游击队Sendero Luminoso（光辉道路）的崛起。	After all, desertification and deforestation helped fuel the rise, two decades earlier, of the Maoist guerilla group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) in Peru.
欧洲各国政府还应改革其税收制度，让那些有长期稳定工作的劳动者缴纳更多，为雇佣弱势劳动者的公司提供财政激励，并推动建立全欧盟层面的贫困保险计划。	European governments should also overhaul their tax systems to make older workers contribute more, offer fiscal incentives to companies that hire disadvantaged workers, and move toward establishing an EU-wide poverty-insurance scheme.
公共和私人投资 — — 中国过去四十年中的主要增长驱动力 — — 可以在扩大国内需求方面扮演核心角色，但必须要在高回报的前提下。	Public and private investment – which has served as a key driver of China’s growth over the last four decades – can play a central role in expanding domestic demand, but only if returns are high.
美联储正试图迫使外国银行建立一个控股公司，下属各单独资本化了的子公司，这能有效地让美联储直接监督他们的业务。	The Fed is seeking to oblige foreign banks to create a holding company to own their separately capitalized subsidiaries, effectively giving the Fed direct oversight of their business.
目前，在美联储新主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）的领导下，政策可谓出色；但这并没有阻止特朗普公开抱怨利率升高过快。	So far, the Fed’s policies under its new chairman, Jerome Powell, have been spot on; but that hasn’t stopped Trump from publicly complaining that interest rates are rising too rapidly.
比方说在德黑兰，改革派人士赢得了所有席位，从而保证现任市长 — — 这位市长本人也是一位保守派总统候选人 — — 很快就会失去这一职位。	In Tehran, for example, the reformist slate won every seat, ensuring that the current mayor – himself a conservative presidential candidate – will soon be out of a job.
说来凑巧，像肯尼思·罗格夫、拉里·萨默斯和彼得·沙德这样的著名观察家认为美国甚至应逐步淘汰100美元的钞票。	As it happens, such prominent observers as Kenneth Rogoff, Larry Summers, and Peter Sands think the US should even phase out $100 bills, too.
1970年时“无国界医生”组织的创始人贝尔纳·库什内（Bernard Kouchner）希望国际社会干涉尼日利亚事务，因为他看见尼日利亚政府军杀害伊博族人，就跟当年在奥斯维辛集中营发生的那样。	Bernard Kouchner, the founder of Doctors Without Borders, wanted the world to intervene in Nigeria in 1970, because he saw the killing of Ibos by Nigerian troops as a genocidal echo of Auschwitz.
对库尔德人而言，冲突的扩大化意味着在对抗残酷独裁统治的同时，我们还要面对试图在中东建立伊斯兰酋长国的基地武装分子。	For the Kurds, the widening conflict meant that, in addition to fighting a brutal dictatorship, we were now confronted by Al Qaeda militants seeking to establish an Islamic emirate in the Middle East.
而民主党尽管仍然由建制派的选择希拉里·克林顿代表，其竞争对手伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）斗争之激烈超过了几乎所有人的预料。	And while the Democratic Party is being represented by the establishment choice, Hillary Clinton, her competitor, Bernie Sanders, put up a much stronger fight than virtually anyone anticipated.
大量研究表明，移民对于本土出生的工人的工资和就业的消极效应可以忽略不计，更不用说目的国的财政资源了。	A large body of research shows that immigrants have a negligible negative impact on the wages and employment of native-born workers, not to mention on the fiscal resources of destination countries.
我可以从自家的窗口凝视着下面的拾荒者：刮得趣青的头皮、粗壮如牛的脖子，还有臃肿不堪的鼻子，呲着黏液覆盖的鼻毛，短粗的臂膀充满了罪恶的力量。	From my window, I watched the Rubbish Gangster: shaven head, bull neck, and swollen nose, from which dangled mucus-incrusted strands of hair, his short arms bursting with criminal power.
美国的年度通胀率从2008年7月的5.6%降到当年12月的0.1 % 。 欧洲则从2008年7月的4.4%降至2009年1月的2.2 % 。	In the US, the annual inflation rate fell from 5.6% in July 2008 to 0.1% in December 2008, and in Europe from 4.4% in July 2008 to 2.2% in January 2009.
巴黎 — — “如果法律做出这种假设 ” ， 《雾都孤儿》中的班布尔先生说 ， “ 那法律就是混蛋、白痴 。 ”	PARIS – “If the law supposes that,” says Mr. Bumble in Oliver Twist, “the law is a ass – a idiot.”
所有这些都需要时间，但一旦发生便能缓和不利影响：需求和供给曲线将因油价升高（或预计升高）而产生移动。	All of this takes time, but, as it occurs, it mitigates the negative impact: the demand and supply curves shift in response to higher prices (or to anticipation of higher prices).
与此同时，对紧缩及改革上疲于奔命的欧元区外围国家 — — 与非欧元区的欧盟成员国（例如匈牙利和波兰）之间 — — 与厌倦救助的核心国家冲突不断。	Meanwhile, austerity and reform fatigue on the eurozone periphery – and among non-eurozone EU members such as Hungary and Poland – is clashing with bailout fatigue in the core.
而总负担 — — 包括失业 — — 几乎肯定将主要落在穷人头上，而相信债务是免费午餐的民粹主义者心安理得地忽视这一事实。	And the overall burden, including unemployment, would almost surely fall disproportionately on the poor, a fact that populists who believe that debt is a free lunch conveniently ignore.
对国企改革进展缓慢的泛泛抱怨也许忽视了一个战略性挑战：在国企和新技术上市企业巨头之间，形成在数字空间的良性竞争。	Superficial complaints about the slow pace of SOE reforms ignore the strategic challenge of creating productive competition between SOEs and publicly listed tech giants in the digital space.
据《科学》期刊登载的一篇针对15个不同人群的研究报告指出，那些实行市场经济的社会对待陌生人更为公平。	A recent study of 15 diverse populations, reported in the journal Science, found that the societies that treat anonymous strangers most fairly are those with market economies.
但其实世界上有足够的土地支持这种规模的可再生能源扩张，只要我们采取快速行动，就有足够的时间进行必要的投资。	But there is plenty enough land in the world to support renewable expansion on that scale, and enough time to make the necessary investments as long as we act fast.
此外，为了论证其调低评级的合理性，穆迪指出，中国政府保持强健增长的努力意味着持续的政策刺激，而持续的政策刺激将带来更高的经济总体债务水平。	Moreover, to justify its downgrade, it argues that the government’s efforts to maintain robust growth will result in sustained policy stimulus, which will contribute to even higher debt throughout the economy.
当是时，人们担心东扩会制造欧盟内部冲突，因为来自中东欧的新成员国比较贫穷，其中有几个农业部门十分庞大。	At the time, it was feared that this eastern enlargement would create tensions within the EU because new members from Central and Eastern Europe were poor and some had large agricultural sectors.
相反，他们的选择基于谁是大家眼中最漂亮的人，以及大家认为大家怎么看 — — 最后的结果就像是猫在追逐自己的尾巴。	Instead, their choice is based on a prediction of who average opinion believes is the prettiest, and what average opinion thinks average opinion is – thus ending up like cats chasing after their own tails.
受困国需要提高生产率，这一点是毫无疑问的，但在当前极端的紧缩和通缩气候下，要达到这一目标是不可能的任务，因为潜在或公开社会冲突相当激烈。	The need for higher productivity in the troubled countries is undeniable; but achieving it in the current climate of extreme austerity and deflation is unlikely, given an atmosphere of latent, or open, social conflict.
像萨尔玛·海耶克、罗斯·麦高恩和瑞茜·威瑟斯彭这样的明星愿意分享她们遭性侵的故事鼓励了来自各行各业的女性分享自己的遭遇。	The willingness of celebrities like Salma Hayek, Rose McGowan, and Reese Witherspoon to share their stories of sexual harassment empowered women from many walks of life to speak out, too.
正因为当年在某些变量过于特异，同时另一些变量又过于模糊，使得联合国在萨尔瓦多的武器换土地协议必须重新谈判才得以实施。	Too much specificity on some variables and too much vagueness with regard to others required a renegotiation of the arms-for-land agreement in El Salvador to make it implementable.
而更重要的是，他在2010年所取得的成绩，将在很大程度上决定世界将如何把这些业已存在了60年的反核武器禁令，继续维护下去。	Even more important, his progress in 2010 will say a lot about the world’s ability to maintain the existing 60-year taboo against the use of nuclear weapons.
让欧洲国家以前所未有的姿态紧密团结的全球性压力空前巨大，因此欧盟宪法公约的僵局绝不会使欧洲长时间偏离正轨。	The global pressures pushing European nations closer together are as strong as ever, so the impasse over the EU’s constitutional treaty was never going to push Europe off course for very long.
这需要时间，但中国已经向IMF申请将人民币纳入决定其账户单位 — — 特别提款权（SDR）价值的货币篮子中。 2015年底或能见分晓。	This takes time, but China is already applying to the IMF to have the renminbi included in the basket of currencies that determines the value of the Fund’s unit of account, Special Drawing Rights, with a decision likely in late 2015.
同样重要的是，正如日本与全世界分享其创新产品和技术，日本也能够输出成功的政策，用同样或类似的措施提高其他发达国家的生活水平。	Equally important, just as it has shared its innovative goods and technologies with the world, Japan could end up exporting successful policies, with the same or similar measures increasing standards of living in other advanced countries as well.
平均持股的时间日益下降与所谓的“无控股企业”现象似乎有联系，因而股东没有什么动力迫使管理层遵守纪律。	But Haldane’s main concern is with the stability of markets, particularly the threats posed by high-frequency trading (HFT).
根据经合组织的最新数据，2016年各国对非洲中小学教育的援助总额仅为13亿美元，须知美国五角大楼的预算大约是每天20亿美元。	According to the most recent OECD data, total donor aid for primary and secondary education in Africa amounted to just $1.3 billion in 2016. To put that figure in perspective, the US Pentagon budget is roughly $2 billion per day.
韩国三星，印度塔塔以及中国阿里巴巴等主要新兴市场跨国企业也将推动本国的增长并在新兴市场各国之间的外国直接投资。	Major emerging-market multinational corporations like Samsung, Tata, and Alibaba will also drive growth in their home countries and foster FDI flows among emerging markets.
但是，如果有正确的方针 — — 以及一点点运气 — — 中国可以确保这一回的复苏将比过去更加可持续。	But, with the right approach – and a bit of good luck – it can make sure that, this time, it recovers more sustainably than in the past.
当然，虽然勒庞放弃了反犹宣传、对维希法国的怀旧之情、对阿尔及利亚战争的光荣回忆、甚至自己的父亲，但她仍然煽动民粹主义之火。	Of course, even as Le Pen has dropped the anti-Semitic blurbs, vocal nostalgia for Vichy France, proud reminiscences of the Algerian war, and even her own father, she has continued to fuel the populist bonfire.
叶利钦自然知道恐惧和自上而下、中央集权的决策绝不是统治现代社会的好方法，因此他坚持把改革公民和国家之间的关系作为重点。	Yeltsin intuitively understood that fear and top-down, centralized decision-making were no way to rule a modern country, and he therefore insisted on reforming relations between citizens and the state.
比如，中国军事规划者发展出一种“超限战”战略，利用电子、外交、网络、恐怖主义代理、经济和宣传工具欺骗和疲惫美国的系统。	In China, for example, military planners developed a strategy of “unrestricted warfare” that combines electronic, diplomatic, cyber, terrorist-proxy, economic, and propaganda tools to deceive and exhaust US systems.
但他们也应该减小对因切利克等土耳其军事基地的依赖，不让土耳其获得F-35等先进军事设备，并重新考虑在土耳其部署核武器的政策。	But they must also reduce their reliance on access to Turkish bases such as Incirlik, deny Turkey access to advanced military hardware like F-35s, and reconsider the policy of basing nuclear weapons in Turkey.
由西班牙和土耳其政府共同启动的文明联盟（Alliance of Civilizations）项目就是其中一个范例。	The Alliance of Civilizations, begun by Spain and Turkey, is one example.
同理，它们还稀释了“改善的下水道”的目标。 这一目标的本意是收集、处理和安全排放废水，而国际组织的方针是改善居民家中的厕所。	In the same way, they have diluted the goal of “improved sanitation” – the process of collecting, treating, and safely discharging wastewater – by applying it to indoor toilets in people’s homes.
危害可能是生理的（死胎、畸形和遗传缺陷 ） ， 但即使是技术成功的基因工程也可能给儿童带来心理危害，他们可能会遭遇玩伴异样的目光，被视为“异类 ” 。	The harm can be physical (stillbirths, deformities, and genetic disorders); but, even genetic engineering that is technically successful can cause psychosocial harm to children, who may be shunned by peers for being odd-looking or merely “different.”
近几年来，英国选择退出单一货币和申根协议（允许欧洲人在不用护照的情况下自由地穿越国境 ） ， 一直与重要的欧盟计划保持着距离。	In recent years, having opted-out of the single currency and the Schengen area (which allows Europeans to cross borders without passports), the UK has distanced itself from important EU initiatives.
美元在20世纪20年代获得了世界货币的地位。 当时新成立的美联储开始买卖美元，建立相应的市场并增加其流动性。	The dollar originally acquired international currency status in the 1920’s, when the newly established Federal Reserve started buying and selling dollar acceptances, backstopping the market and enhancing its liquidity.
库尔德武装在进行了几个月的苦斗后最近终于成功地将伊斯兰国势力清除出边境小镇科巴尼（Kobane ） 。	Kurdish forces recently succeeded, after months of heavy fighting, in expelling the Islamic State from the border town of Kobane.
但在政治上，欧洲经济区成员资格将是一项不公正的待遇，因为英国将必须在诸如消费者保护，环境和社会政策领域遵守单一市场规则和立法 — — 而在制定这些法律法规的过程中不享有任何发言权。	Politically, though, EEA membership would be a raw deal. Britain would have to comply with single-market rules and legislation in areas such as consumer protection, the environment, and social policy – rules that it would have no say in creating.
尽管吸纳移民主要国家采取限制移民措施，但是鉴于在仅仅4年之内波兰移民人口就达到大约5 % ， 因此这些估计过于谨慎。	Given that about 5% of the Polish population has now emigrated within a period of only four years, despite immigration restrictions by important target countries, these estimates were much too cautious.
决策者需要关于世界最大健康威胁以及它们如何随时间、年龄段和性别的不同而不同的信息，以便他们确保所有人都有机会获得最长寿、最健康的生命。	Decision-makers need information about the world’s biggest health threats and how they have changed over time, across age groups, and by sex, so they can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live the longest, healthiest life possible.
此外，伊斯兰正义和发展党在土耳其选民中拥有广泛的支持，并且在经济发展、人权立法和改善土耳其库尔德少数民族的待遇等问题上都表现得非常出色。	Moreover, the AKP has broad support among Turkish voters and an admirable record of economic growth, human rights legislation, and improvement in the treatment of Turkey’s Kurdish minority.
肯尼迪宣布该计划后仅仅八年，宇航员尼尔·阿姆斯特朗（Neil Armstrong）就在月球的尘土上留下了脚印。	Just eight years after Kennedy’s announcement, astronaut Neil Armstrong pressed his footprint into the lunar dust.
实际上，从1991年国际收支平衡危机爆发以来，印度一直在摈弃其社会主义遗产而且其年度经济增长率达到7.5 ％ ， 只比中国略低。	Indeed, since 1991, when a balance-of-payments crisis loomed, India has been shedding its socialist legacies and posting 7.5% average annual GDP growth – only marginally slower than China.
2000年以色列从黎巴嫩撤军时，距离其第一次入侵已经过去了近20年，真主党也已经成长为黎巴嫩的一支强大的军事、政治和社会力量，也是对以色列一侧的持续性威胁。	By the time Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, nearly 20 years after its original invasion, Hezbollah had become a formidable military, political, and social force in Lebanon, and a continuing thorn in Israel’s side.
我们已不再直接从机构把关者那里接收信息，这些把关者尽管往往在流程的执行方面存在缺陷，但从本质上讲却致力于达到编辑目标，今天，我们获得信息的方式是通过点对点共享。	Rather than receiving our information directly from institutional gatekeepers, who, despite often-flawed execution, were fundamentally committed to meeting editorial standards, today we acquire it via peer-to-peer sharing.
尽管中共使用不同的手段来压制它们的发展，但是四川地震表明中共无法将非政府组织作为一支社会力量加以消除。	Although the Party uses various means to suppress their development, the Sichuan earthquake demonstrated that it has failed to eliminate NGOs as a social force.
这一情绪背后的基础并不显而易见，因为美国经济比五六年前2007—2008年经济危机刚刚过去时情况要好。	The basis of this mood is hardly self-evident, as the country is better off economically than it was a half-dozen years ago, in the immediate aftermath of the 2007-2008 economic crisis.
未来，从军用空中监测发展而来的技术将大量用于民用 — — 比如帮助控制交通、减少拥堵以及协助人道主义救援队的派遣。	In the future, technology developed for military aerial surveillance could have major civilian benefits – for example, helping to control traffic and reduce road congestion, and assisting in the dispatch of rescue teams and humanitarian assistance.
日本经验的第一个教训是，尽管欧元区在以储蓄过剩为特征的老龄化社会中难以实现通胀，但经济增长并不一定是遥不可及的。	A first lesson of Japan’s experience is that, despite the eurozone’s difficulty generating inflation in an aging society characterized by excess savings, growth is not necessarily out of reach.
一个接一个的IMF项目要求巴基斯坦征缴更多预扣税（而且从未退还过 ） ， 附加费以及针对石油和电力等基本商品的税款，即便这些措施会损害就业和投资增长。	Successive IMF programs have required that Pakistan adopt more withholding taxes (never to be refunded), surcharges, and levies on essential goods such as oil and electricity, even though these measures hurt employment and investment growth.
安曼—约旦皇家法院（Royal Court）在穆斯林兄弟会的穆尔西宣布取得埃及总统大选胜利后这几天的行为颇有点意思。	AMMAN – The behavior of Jordan’s Royal Court in the days following the official announcement of the victory of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt’s presidential election tells an intriguing story.
世界上所有守法政府和普罗大众都应当致电或发邮件质问德瓦尔特，五角大楼以及白宫新闻办公室，要求他们给出答案。	The world’s law-abiding governments and ordinary citizens should call and email DeWalt, the Pentagon, and the White House press office to demand answers.
伦敦—美国总统特朗普加码对华贸易战，美联储也在提高美国利率，而几个月前还一片光明的全球经济前景也开始显得黯淡起来。	LONDON – As US President Donald Trump ratchets up his trade war with China and the Federal Reserve Board increases US interest rates, the prospects for the world economy and financial markets, so bright just a few months ago, appear to be darkening.
从这个角度讲，民主 — — 许多人所谓的“自由民主 ” — —只有在工业革命引起民族国家的出现和群众剧变和动员后才可能发生。	Democracy in this sense – what many call “liberal democracy” – flourished only after the emergence of the nation-state and the popular upheaval and mobilization produced by the Industrial Revolution.
坎布里奇 — — 在5月下旬典型的一周，共和党的假定总统提名人唐纳德·特朗普再次登上了报纸的头版头条。	CAMBRIDGE – During a typical week in late May, Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the US presidency, grabbed headlines yet again.
没有在美国领导下联合国对朝鲜战争的干涉，南朝鲜就会落到伟大领袖金日成的掌控之中，而它现在的自由和繁荣也就会成为永远的梦想。	Without UN intervention in the Korean War, led by the US, the South would have been taken over by Kim Il Sung, the Great Leader, and their current freedom and prosperity would never have been possible.
两年前，一位艾滋病毒测试呈阳性的尼日利亚男青年在Facebook上与我联系，向我讲述了他每个月在诊所经受的折磨。	Two years ago, a young HIV-positive Nigerian man contacted me on Facebook to tell me about his monthly ordeal at the clinic.
这项突破使新的诊断和诊疗成为可能，但如果说这样的洞见能够用计算机在几分钟而不是几十年内完成，你作何感想？	The breakthrough promises new kinds of diagnosis and therapy, but what if such insights could be developed by computers in minutes, rather than decades?
而到2018年2月美联储主席珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）的第一个任期也将结束，给特朗普造就了一个特殊的机会去给该机构贴上自己的标签。	And in February 2018, Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s first term will end, giving Trump a unique opportunity to stamp his brand on the institution.
没有全球性的反托拉斯机关，没有全球性的最终贷款人，没有全球性的调控者，没有全球性的安全网，以及当然没有的全球性的民主。	There is no global anti-trust authority, no global lender of last resort, no global regulator, no global safety nets, and, of course, no global democracy.
这番话概括了他在第一个任期中所采取的“参与”外交政策 — — 这一方针尽管存在一些缺陷，但优点也很多。	This statement encapsulated the foreign policy of “engagement” that he endorsed during his first term – an approach that, despite some shortcomings, has a lot of merit.
随着这些政策的失败，全球金融市场反应消极，增加了世界经济的不稳定性。 这种情况不会在可见的未来缓和，因为美国正在进入漫长的政治内讧和僵持的时期。	As those policies fail, global financial markets are reacting negatively, adding uncertainty to the world economy, and there is little relief in sight, because America is entering a period of prolonged political infighting and stalemate.
政治的角色就是创造、维持和改写这一共同自我意识，即“我们”意识 （ “ 他们”意识也随之而定 ） 。	It is the role of politics to create, sustain, and reshape this shared sense of self, of us (and hence of them).
重建一个控制叙利亚全境的叙利亚政府不是美国和其他任何国家的根本国家利益；最根本的是击溃伊斯兰国和类似的集团。	Neither the US nor anyone else has a vital national interest in restoring a Syrian government that controls all of the country’s territory; what is essential is to roll back the Islamic State and similar groups.
从几乎所有人都预期会获胜的前国务卿希拉里·克林顿，到反对让特朗普充当候选人的共和党，都低估了这位美国当选总统。	From former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was by virtually all accounts the favorite to win, to the Republicans who opposed his candidacy, people vastly underestimated the US president-elect.
对此，美国及其盟国不应迫使北京方面切断与朝鲜的往来，而是应进一步加强自身的努力，将朝鲜从与世隔绝的状况中拉出。	Instead of pressing Beijing to cut off North Korea, the US and its allies should further develop their own efforts to draw North Korea out of its insularity.
但是美国最高法院一再裁定州不能抵消或违反联邦法律 — — 南部一些州在20世纪中叶抵制学校种族融合时曾要求享有这类权利。	But the US Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that states may not nullify or contravene federal law – a right some southern states claimed in the mid-twentieth century to resist school integration.
就在上个月，我赴中国考察了那些原本偏远但如今因为基础设施投资而与外界连通 — — 并因此带来人员，商品和理念的更自由流动 — — 并因此实现繁荣的地区。	Last month, I visited formerly remote areas of the country that are now prosperous as a result of the connectivity – and thus the freer flow of people, goods, and ideas – that such investments have delivered.
除更好地激励研究人员和资金捐助机构，还需要根本转变科学文化来加速科学进步，这方面有几项充满希望的计划正在开展中。	Beyond better incentives for researchers and donors, a fundamental shift in the culture of science is needed to accelerate scientific progress, and several promising initiatives are underway.
与现行的、理想主义的—且明显难以为继的—铲除行动形成鲜明对比的，是农民们在反毒品的计划中还能获得一种主人翁的感觉。	Farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter-narcotics efforts, in sharp contrast to the current idealistic – and evidently un-achievable – policy of crop eradication.
当然，美国的这些引起不安的行为是有许多因素引起的，但是，其中一个重要的因素是反知识主义，最近共和党副总统候选人萨拉. 佩林快速走红就是一个例证。	While many factors contributed to America’s destabilizing actions, a powerful one is anti-intellectualism, exemplified recently by Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin’s surging popularity.
1990年，我在乌克兰成立了文艺复兴基金会（Renaissance Foundation ） ， 当时乌克兰还尚未独立。	I established the Renaissance Foundation in Ukraine in 1990 – before the country achieved independence.
比尔和莎莉·科尔（Bill and Sari Kerr）指出，移民仅占美国人口的13 % ， 但贡献了26%的企业家，36%的新企业领导团队中至少有一名移民。	Bill and Sari Kerr have shown that, while immigrants represent about 13% of the US population, they account for 26% of all entrepreneurs, and about 36% of new firms have at least one immigrant in the leadership team.
即使是其最坚决的支持者 — — 俄罗斯和伊朗也暗示，如果巴沙尔通过谈判下台而不是被起义推翻（并且如果继任者对俄罗斯和伊朗保持友好 ） ， 那么他的下台也是可以接受的。	Even Russia and Iran, his most vociferous supporters, have hinted that they could accept his departure if he steps down through negotiations, rather than being ousted by a popular revolt (and as long as the successor regime is friendly to them).
但是精英大学（和商学院）对太子党的优惠待遇具有真实的社会成本，因为这些学校的招生名额是一场零和游戏。	But preferential treatment for princelings at elite universities (and business schools) has real social costs, because admission to these institutions is zero-sum.
范龙佩的报告引出了一个根本性问题：什么因素使欧元区不能像所有人期许的那样运转？ 要回答这一问题，最重要的是比较欧元的第一个十年 — — 1999—2009年间起作用的动态。	Van Rompuy’s report raises a fundamental question: What factors are preventing the eurozone from functioning as everyone would wish?
事实上，官方文件甚至已经开始质疑1990年代俄罗斯大公司私有化的合法性，并启动了有关修正这些私有化成果的讨论。	In fact, official documents have now even started questioning the legitimacy of the privatization of the leading Russian companies in the 1990’s, which has opened the way for discussions about revising the outcomes of these privatizations.
对美国发动攻击也许是进一步干涉欧洲选举的先声。 2017年，欧洲将进行一系列选举，包括荷兰、德国和法国等国家，目前官员正在竞相对抗俄罗斯的网络行动。	The attack on the US may have been a precursor to further electoral meddling in Europe, where officials are now racing to counter Russian cyber operations before a series of major elections in 2017, including in the Netherlands, Germany, and France.
卢的自杀对其家庭是个灾难，对其国家是个耻辱，而朝鲜核爆炸则是领导人金正日火爆脾气的某种体现，以上事件是对于两个朝鲜族国家，乃至整个世界来说都有很严重的后果。	Roh’s suicide is a disaster for his family and a national shame, while North Korean leader Kim Jong-il’s nuclear blast is something of a temper tantrum, but one which may have dire consequences for the two Koreas and the world.
政治领袖们以此为自己的软弱无力辩护，知识分子们仍在幻想着那个可行性极低的全球治理方略，而全球竞争中的失败者也把矛头指向移民或者进口产品。	Political leaders plead impotence, intellectuals dream up implausible global-governance schemes, and the losers increasingly blame immigrants or imports.
如今，领先民调的第一大党是叛逆的民粹主义政党五星运动（M5S ） ， 其领导人是喜剧演员格里洛（Beppe Grillo，但其正式总理候选人缺乏经验的31岁新人迪马伊奥（Luigi Di Maio ） ） 。	Today, the leading single party in opinion polls is the insurgent, populist Five Star Movement (M5S), led by the comedian Beppe Grillo (though its official prime ministerial candidate is an inexperienced 31-year-old, Luigi Di Maio).
此外，跟其他央行不同，欧洲央行的谈判对手不止一个，也没有任何一个对其负责的政府事实上或让人感觉能掌控欧元区这个整体。	Moreover, unlike its counterparts, the ECB does not face a single interlocutor, and none of the governments that hold it accountable is or feels in charge of the eurozone as a whole.
这个新的精英领导阶层在许多方面都比其前任更加具有全球性；他们的平均教育水平更高；有些还获得了国外学位。	This new leadership elite is in many ways more cosmopolitan than its predecessors; their average level of education is higher; a few have foreign degrees.
尽管安倍维持其在靖国神社问题上的立场不变，但是，他与中国国家主席胡锦涛的会见就是一个令人鼓舞的举动。	While Abe has maintained his position on Yasukuni, his summit with Chinese President Hu Jintao was a promising step forward.
伦敦 — “ 老实说 ， ” 比尔·盖茨在本月早些时候的COP21巴黎大会期间说 ， “ 我有些震惊，从历史上看，气候谈判日程上见不到任何研发发面的方法、内容或形式 。 ” 我也是。	LONDON – “Honestly,” said Bill Gates during the COP21 meeting in Paris earlier this month, “I’ve been a bit surprised that the climate talks historically haven’t had R&D on the agenda in any way, shape, or form.”
Internet.org — — 扎克伯格上个月推出的全球合作计划 — — 志在让无法获得互联网接入的三分之二世界人口进入数字时代。	Internet.org, a global partnership launched by Zuckerberg last month, plans to bring the two-thirds of the world’s population without Internet access into the Digital Age.
此外他们还分属于几个大的部落，这样就能确保如果像埃及那样由军事委员会进行接管，那么部族利益将会得到广泛的代表。	They also belong to several large tribes, guaranteeing wide tribal representation if a military council were to take power, as in Egypt.
欧洲宪法和这些挑战毫无关系，但是大部分法国人已经开始质疑那个长期以来掩饰着法国日益衰弱的地位的策略。	The European Constitution has little to do with any of these challenges, but a majority of French people has started questioning the strategy that has long masked France’s diminishing status.
布拉格 — — 四分之一世纪以前，当柏林墙倒塌、铁幕升起，中欧人选择了资本主义和民主，抛弃了专制及共产主义。	PRAGUE – A quarter-century ago, when the Berlin Wall fell and the Iron Curtain rose, the people of Central Europe chose capitalism over communism and democracy over dictatorship.
幸运的是，印度主权债务评级的降级威胁 — — 有可能使其难以为经常项目赤字融资 — — 已促使政府重新制定和改变政策。	Fortunately, the recent threat of a downgrade of Inda’s sovereign credit rating – which would have made it difficult to finance the current-account deficit – has led to a government reshuffle and a shift in policies.
在这场亚的斯亚贝巴会议上，三种主要合作方 — — 政府、慈善机构和大公司 — — 应该将资源集中起来，让穷国扩大教育，特别是学前和中学教育。	The three major types of partners convening in Addis Ababa – governments, philanthropists, and top companies – should pool resources to enable impoverished countries to scale up education, especially at the pre-K and secondary levels.
En la tragedia que se cobró las vidas del Presidente polaco Lech Kaczynski y otras 95 autoridades polacas, podemos responder con certidumbre al menos en un aspecto: la historia la tiene.	In the tragedy that claimed the lives of Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 other Polish leaders, we can answer that question with certainty in at least one respect: history is to blame.
全球在线课程是方兴未艾的信息革命的一部分 — — 这一个名正在重塑高等教育格局，其最重要的特征是为全世界更多的人创造了获得高等教育的渠道。	Online global courses are part of the world’s ongoing information revolution – a revolution that is now fundamentally reshaping higher education, most importantly by creating new avenues of access for more people around the world.
虽然民主未列入他的议程，但他的言论及其追随者在国内不断制造的武装冲突毫无疑问是要瓦解当朝政权的合法性。	While democracy is not part of his agenda, his messages, as well as his followers’ periodic armed attacks inside the country, have no doubt contributed to the erosion of the regime’s legitimacy.
在欧元推出一年后的2000年，美国经济的规模仅比欧元区大13 ％ ； 到2016年已经拉大到26 ％ 。	In 2000, a year after the euro was introduced, the US economy was only 13% larger than the eurozone; by 2016 it was 26% larger.
尽管法国选民在2005年的时候反对制定欧盟新宪法（这部分也是对希拉克的反对投票 ） ， 但是所有三位候选人都认识到欧盟是加强法国在世界事务中的地位的一个重要工具。	Despite French voters’ rejection of a new constitution for the European Union in 2005 (in part a protest vote against Chirac), all three candidates recognize that the EU has been an important means to enhance French power in world affairs.
这是一个重大差别，特别是考虑到中国人均GDP只有日本最高峰水平的19 % ， 而其债务已经达到日本的60 % 。	This is a substantial difference, especially considering that China’s per capita GDP amounts to only 19% of Japan’s at its highest level, and that its debt has already reached 60% of Japan’s.
我们呼吁非洲开发银行成立一个基础设施基金、扩展2013年启动的马诺河计划（Mano River Initiative ） ， 以深化地区一体化为目标。	We ask the African Development Bank to take the initiative in creating an infrastructure fund, an extension of the Mano River Initiative, launched in 2013, with the objective of furthering regional integration.
特别是虽然中国的贸易部门受到了发达国家的极大影响，但政府也愿意接受一些短期的减速，而非采取一些可能引发混乱的刺激措施。	In particular, although China’s tradable sector is highly exposed to developed economies, the government is likely to accept some short-run slowdown, rather than adopting potentially distorting stimulus measures.
有时候，ECT的批评者似乎是按照如果他们可以废除ECT，精神疾病就会随之消失这样的浪漫幻想来行为的。	It sometimes seems that the critics are behaving according to the romantic illusion that if they can just abolish ECT, mental illness will disappear with it.
法国支持欧元成员资格，因为他们希望包括自己在内的地中海国家能够在资本市场上以与德国相同的低利率实现借贷。	The French supported euro membership, because they wanted the Mediterranean countries, including themselves, to be able to borrow at the same low rates as Germany on the capital markets.
这一切都始于1944年布雷顿森林体系中建立的国际货币体系 — — 基于“混合”经济，对不平等状况的遏制以及强大的金融监管的战后政治共识 — — 的崩溃。	It all began with the death of the international monetary system established at Bretton Woods in 1944, which had forged a post-war political consensus based on a “mixed” economy, limits on inequality, and strong financial regulation.

在以相对和平的方式迅雷不及掩耳地推翻穆巴拉克30年铁腕政权后，埃及的革命群众理应离开街道，全力建设经济繁荣和社会正义。	Having overthrown Hosni Mubarak’s iron-fisted 30-year-old regime in a remarkably quick and relatively peaceful manner, Egypt’s revolutionary masses were to leave the streets and pursue an all-out drive for economic prosperity and social justice.
但是，对戴蒙德理论来说不幸的是，许多最重要的农作物也充满了毒素，如果它们现在才出现，很有可能会排除在人类消费范围之外。	But, unfortunately for Diamond’s theory, many of our most important crops are also stuffed full of toxins, to the extent that if they were introduced today, they would most likely be banned for human consumption.
它们帮助地球摆脱了天花，即将消灭脊髓灰质炎，并且每一年能挽救数百万人的生命，减轻传染病造成的痛苦和负担。	They have helped rid the planet of the scourge of smallpox, are poised to eliminate polio, and each year prevent millions of deaths, reducing the suffering and costs caused by infectious diseases.
当布莱尔效仿他的朋友、美国总统比尔·克林顿，通过承诺“第三条路”成为英国首相时，社会主义似乎已经死透了。	By the time Blair, following the example of his friend US President Bill Clinton, became Prime Minister by promoting the “third way,” socialism seemed to be dead and buried.
IPCC发现，按照当前温室气体排放速度，到2040年，因海水泛滥、旱灾、风暴、热浪和野火导致的增加的成本预计将达到54万亿美元。	The IPCC finds that if greenhouse-gas emissions continue at current rates, the additional costs due to coastal flooding, droughts, storms, extreme heat, and wildfires will reach an estimated $54 trillion by 2040.

除了输出其比较优势，中国也在部署“耐心资本 ” （ patient capital ） ， 这种投资期限往往达到十年或更长。	In addition to exporting its comparative advantages, China also deploys “patient capital,” which has a maturity of ten years or more.
在欧洲，疯牛病之所以让许多人震惊，不仅仅是因为它打破了牛肉作为一种安全健康食品的形象，而且因为人们知道了这种病的根源是给牛饲喂羊的脑浆和神经组织。	In Europe, mad cow disease shocked many people, not only because it shattered beef’s image as a safe and healthy food, but also because they learned that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep.
印尼和马来西亚加起来占了世界棕榈油市场的85 % ， 两国已同意成立棕榈油生产国委员会（Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries）以协调标准、促进生产活动的环境可持续性。	Indonesia and Malaysia, which together account for 85% of the world palm oil market, have agreed to establish the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries, which will harmonize standards and promote environmentally sustainable production practices.
欧洲在建立一个更美好的世界的进程中发挥着特殊的作用。 在这样一个世界里，人权和个人自由得到广泛和完全的尊重。	Europe has a special role to play in securing a better world where human rights and individual freedoms are widely and fully respected.
大家都是人，减轻危害措施全球通行，更何况最大的受益者就是这些国家本身 — — 减少艾滋病毒传播，犯罪率下降，吸毒者也能重新投入工作。	Humans are humans. Harm reduction works everywhere, and the main financial benefactors are the countries themselves, which see reduced spread of HIV, drops in crime, and people returning to work.
我们甚至可以组织自我融资的未来研究，或只参加给予我们决定我们的数据如何使用、用在哪里的法定权利的研究。	We can even organize to self-fund future studies or join only those studies that give us the legal right to say how and where our data are used.
类似地，如果特朗普成功获胜，大部分民主党人（甚至一些共和党人）在从震惊与沮丧中回过神之后将把确保特朗普无法参加第二次竞选作为最高任务。	Similarly, if Trump manages to win, most Democrats (and even some Republicans) will – after recovering from their surprise and dismay – make it their highest priority to ensure that he does not have an opportunity for a second term.
因此，普金所谓的与日本就北方四岛达成协议完全是个谎言，一如他宣称克里米亚的俄罗斯族面临着危险因此需要派遣俄罗斯军队予以保护。	So Putin’s talk about reaching an agreement with Japan on the Northern Territories was likely as mendacious as his claims that Russians in Crimea were in peril, and thus in need of protection by Russian troops.
但是这种对全球市场经济规则的无效反应隐藏了一个事实，即德国的问题从很大程度上来说是过去三十年以来福利过度和欧盟极度侵略性政策的结果。	But this useless reaction to the laws of the global market economy hides the fact that Germany’s problems are largely a result of an overblown welfare state and extremely aggressive union policies over the last thirty years.
大部分评论家都例行公事地以为，若5月29日法国公民投票结果赞成正在审议中的欧盟宪法，这将对欧洲和欧盟都有好处。	Most commentators routinely assume that a Yes vote in the May 29 French referendum on the proposed European Union Constitution would be good for Europe and the EU.
但在中盘的经济关系方面，世界已经是多极化了，而美国也不可能不通过与欧洲、日本、中国和其它国家合作就获得自己需要的结果。	But on the middle board of economic relations, the world is already multipolar, and the US cannot obtain the outcomes it wants without the cooperation of Europe, Japan, China, and others.
但这里的内部装饰有一点与众不同ľ一面嵌着窗户的人造墙把餐馆的厅堂分成了两半，墙后面布置成了一个乡村庭院。	But the interior decoration had one unique element – an artificial wall with windows separating a part of the restaurant hall. Behind the wall was a stage set of a village yard.
科学界日益认识到科学本身不是不受价值控制的活动，因此，选择从事何种研究，如何从事一定要服从于伦理原则。	The scientific community increasingly recognizes that science itself is not a value-free activity and, therefore, the choice of what research to undertake and how to undertake it must be governed by ethical principles.
仅靠区区十国被迫承担大部分负担是完全无法接受的，86%的难民生活在发展中国家，而且每年仅有不到100,000人能够得到安置。	It is simply unacceptable that just ten countries are forced to bear the lion’s share of the burden, that 86% of refugees reside in the developing world, and that fewer than 100,000 per year are resettled.
如果形势继续按照这个节奏发展下去，我们在英国政客身上所看到的革命热情将在“硬退欧”完成之前反噬其身。	If developments continue at this pace, the revolutionary zeal we see among British politicians may burn itself out before “hard Brexit” is consummated.

另外，Uribe的缺席使得查韦斯避免了回应哥伦比亚关于委内瑞拉和其盟国厄瓜多尔支持毒品马克思主义的FARC的指控。	In addition, Uribe’s absence allowed Chávez to avoid responding to Colombia’s accusations that Venezuela and its ally Ecuador support the narco-Marxist FARC.
相比于一个更难相处，更犹豫不决，但也更民主的亚洲盟友，美国似乎更乐于看到一个俯首帖耳的一党专政国家。	The US seems to prefer an obedient one-party state to a difficult, faltering, but more democratic partner in Asia.
阿拉伯社会乱象注定将维持多年，不难预计，新兴地区和世界强国将利用国际秩序的破碎谋求自身在该地区的利益。	Turmoil in Arab societies is bound to persist for years to come, and emerging regional and world powers can be expected to exploit the international order’s fragmentation to advance their interests in the region.
受法律鼓励“诽谤游”的代表官司之一是一名沙特商人起诉一名美国作家，该作家称这名沙特商人为基地组织提供经济援助。	One of the cases that illustrated the kind of “tourism” encouraged by the law involved a suit by a Saudi businessman against an American author who said in her book that the businessman had provided financial support to Al Qaeda.
但如今我们有理由相信未来经济学家的结论和政策建议将不再由框架的优美程度决定，而由它们是否能够符合事实决定。	But now there is reason to hope that, in the future, economists’ conclusions and policy advice will be shaped not by those frameworks’ elegance, but by their ability to fit the facts.
“我们正在切身感受到气候变化急剧扩大的影响 ， ” 印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪在谈到钦奈洪灾时说，并呼吁工业化国家采取更多措施缓解全球变暖的影响。	“We are feeling climate change’s fast-growing impact now,” said India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pointing to Chennai and calling upon industrialized countries to do more to mitigate global warming.
首先，它依赖于一些过分大胆的假设 — — 例如说人们一定无法轻易破解这个迷宫般的系统，而外国政府也不会采取限制性手段来报复性征税。	First, it relies on some heroic assumptions – for example, that people cannot easily game the labyrinthine system and that foreign governments will exercise restraint in retaliating.
尤其在二战后的几年内，多数未受教育或不依赖家庭生活的美国人，都能找到一份“有前途的”工作，过上经济稳定、安全有保障的生活。	Largely independent of education or family, those Americans who did value stability and security could grasp it in the form of jobs with “a future.”
中国一份官方报纸发表社论称尽管中国在朝鲜首先发起攻击的情况下会保持中立，但美国以政权更迭为目标的打击行动将会导致中国介入。	A recent editorial in a Chinese state-run newspaper asserted that while China would stay neutral if North Korea attacked first, US strikes aimed at regime change would cause China to intervene.
荷兰人知道自愿安乐死在他们国家里的实施情况，他们知道合法的安乐死改进了而不是危害了他们的医疗。 他们希望有人能够帮助他们死亡，如果他们希望并且需要的话。	The Dutch know how voluntary euthanasia is practiced in their country, they know that legal euthanasia has improved, rather than harmed, their medical care, and they want the possibility of assistance in dying, if they should want and need it.
但如果市场原教旨主义阻挠扩张性宏观经济政策、阻止再分配性税收或公共支出，那么针对贸易、劳动力市场去监管和退休金改革的民粹主义反对必然会加剧。	But if market fundamentalism blocks expansionary macroeconomic policies and prevents redistributive taxation or public spending, populist resistance to trade, labor-market deregulation, and pension reform is bound to intensify.
如果这些国家像特朗普提出的那样填补了制裁中国后产生的空白，这些高成本生产国无疑会为在美销售产品收取比中国更高的成本价。	If those countries were to fill the void left by a penalty on China, like the one that Trump has proposed, higher-cost producers would undoubtedly charge more than China for products sold in the US.
但是，印度的总统基本上是象征性的职位：真正的权力掌握在总理手中，而且从未有贱民的职位曾靠近过总理一职。	But the Indian Presidency is a largely ceremonial position: real power is vested in the office of prime minister, and no Dalit has come close to holding that post.
尽管有某些非法要求获得补贴的案例正在受到调查，但是并没有出现非法买卖收据的现象；欺诈看上去主要来自伪造的收据。	While some cases of illegitimate claims are under investigation, there is no black market for receipts; fraud seems to arise mainly through falsified invoices.
简言之，面临当前塞缪尔·亨廷顿（Samuel P. Huntington）所谓的民主化的“第三波”消退的情况，我们应该关注自由民主所面临的多重挑战。	In short, we should be concerned about the multiple challenges to liberal democracy during the current setback to what Samuel P. Huntington called the “third wave” of democratization.
正如喜剧演员鲍勃·纽哈特（Bob Newhart）所观察到的 ， “ 教皇让我们孤独；我们也让教皇孤独 。 ”	As the comedian Bob Newhart observed, “The pope leaves us alone; we leave the pope alone.”
利比亚没有象征性的宗教少数派，数十万埃及人在利比亚生活和工作，在这里，宣传基督教是非法的 — — 只要拥有圣经，就可能因传教而被告上法庭。	While Libya has no significant religious minority, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians live and work in the country, where Christian proselytizing is illegal – and where one can be accused of proselytizing simply for possessing a Bible.
这也是TPP的一个巨大的潜在问题，因为竞争性贬值将吞噬贸易所带来的任何数量级的好处，给美国就造成巨大的消极影响。	This is also a huge potential problem with the TPP, because competitive devaluations can swamp any other gains from trade by an order of magnitude, with substantial negative effects on US jobs.
我们希望你们刚刚度过了一个愉快的夏季休假，现在你们回到了华盛顿，不但身心放松，而且充满了能量，做好了处理我们国家的重重经济挑战的准备。	We hope that you had a good summer break, and that you return to Washington not just rested, but also energized to take on our country’s mounting economic challenges.

他们的策略选择已不再是20世纪90年代的武装动乱或21世纪最初十年的组成军事单位进行侵略，而是个人恐怖行动。	Their tactic of choice is no longer armed insurgency, as in the 1990’s, or raids by groups of militants, as in the 2000’s, but individual acts of terror.
从如此煽动性的言辞看，不难理解许多人对于特朗普与中国国家主席习近平在特朗普的海湖庄园举行的峰会感到万分担忧。	Given such inflammatory rhetoric, many people understandably felt considerable trepidation in the run-up to Trump’s summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.

尽管一些损失是拜信息技术和数字化所带来的生产率进步所赐，但也有许多损失的原因是公司将供应链的细分部分转移到了全球经济的其他地方，特别是中国。	Although some of the losses may have resulted from productivity gains from information technology and digitization, many occurred when companies shifted segments of their supply chains to other parts of the global economy, particularly China.
通常，员工—包括福克斯新闻台—缴纳401(K)规定的金额，因而建立401(K)账户是极为诱人的库存融资，是真正不必花脑筋的事情。	Typically, employers – including Fox News – match workers’ 401(k) contributions, so setting up a 401(k) is an irresistible financial deal, a true no-brainer.
历史学家本·弗里德曼曾指出美国历史的“核心问题”既不是“最弱势群体的贫困”也不是“最强势群体的成就 ” ； 而是“最广大民众的经济福祉 ” 。	The historian Ben Friedman has observed that the “central question” in US history is not “the poverty of the most disadvantaged” or “the success of the most privileged”; it is “the economic well-being of the broad majority” of the population.
此外，猪和家禽是理想的食物废料处理者，它们的排泄物也可以作为养料和能量源，将未来食物链融入生产大循环。	Moreover, pigs and poultry are ideal food-waste processors, and their effluents can serve again as nutrient and energy sources, turning future food chains into interconnected production cycles.
传统新闻组织，特别是地方报纸，正在稳步消亡，缩小了选民的信息渠道，而这对于做出知情的政治决策至关重要。	Traditional news organizations, especially local newspapers, are steadily disappearing, shrinking voters’ access to information that is vital to making informed political decisions.
9月，联合国人权和反恐特别书记员埃莫森（Ben Emmerson）报告说美国在巴基斯坦造成了至少400平民死亡，另有200名被杀者“可能并非战斗人员 ” 。	In September, Ben Emmerson, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, reported that the US had caused at least 400 civilian deaths in Pakistan, with another 200 of those killed being “probable noncombatants.”

进步变化研究所（Progressive Change Institute）正在运作“大观点工程 ” （ The Big Ideas Project ） ， 人们投票选择他们所认为的最重要的政策议案。	The Progressive Change Institute is currently running “The Big Ideas Project,” whereby people can vote on what they regard as the most important policy proposals.

在1990年代的波斯尼亚和科索沃战争期间，塞尔维亚独裁者斯洛博丹·米洛舍维奇（Slobodan Milošević）将马其顿人称之为迷失了方向的“友善小兄弟 ” 。	During the Bosnian and Kosovo wars of the 1990s, the Serbian dictator Slobodan Milošević described the people of Macedonia as “kind little brothers” who had lost their way.
为了避免给人以将普通恐惧变成疾病的印象， DSM 的第四版特别增加了一条规定，即社交焦虑行为必须在“造成损害”的情况下才能被诊断为疾病。	To counter the impression that it was turning common fears into treatable conditions, DSM-IV added a clause stipulating that social anxiety behaviors had to be “impairing” before a diagnosis was possible.

如果全球形势突然推高均衡利率，这将让美联储极易蒙受巨额损失，美国政府也将被迫为债务展期支付高得多的利率。	This would leave the Fed extremely vulnerable to enormous losses should global forces suddenly drive up equilibrium interest rates, with the US government then compelled to pay much higher interest rates to roll over its debt.
Ooniprobe诞生前，这些审查很难被侦测到，这导致了难以问责，政府和ISP常常否认一切与审查有关的指控。	Before ooniprobe, such censorship was difficult to detect, leading to a lack of accountability, with governments and ISPs often denying any and all involvement.
西方冷战胜利后不久，伊斯兰原教旨主义的崛起和民族部落主义在“后历史时代”欧洲核心地区的回归有力地质疑了“历史终结”的概念。	Not long after the West’s Cold War victory, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the return of national tribalism, even in the heart of “post-historical” Europe, challenged the concept of “the end of history.”
这一复杂因果关系系统的等级结构诱使我们感觉具有高水平的理解，而这又使得较低水平的理解被误解为较高水平。	This hierarchical structure of complex causal systems seduces us into a sense of understanding at a high level, which is then mistaken for having an understanding at a lower level.
产出继续直线下降：2018年10月的石油输出国组织报告显示产量同比下降37 % ， 也就是每天近70万桶。	Output continues to fall like a stone: OPEC reports that in October 2018, production was down 37% year on year, or almost 700,000 barrels a day.

而拜登一方面重申美方并不视中方为敌，另一方面也暗示傅莹的担忧并非无中生有，认为最坏的情景莫过于因互相之间的误解而引发意料之外的冲突。	Biden, while reaffirming that the US does not view China as an enemy, implied that Fu’s worries are not fanciful, saying that the worst scenario is a misunderstanding that leads to an unintended conflict.
今年开始执政的巴西罗瑟夫总统明白，经济增长将会大大放缓，因此实施了雷亚尔贬值的政策来提振巴西的竞争力。	Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s government, which began its term this year with an understanding that economic growth will slow sharply, devalued the real in order to shore up the country’s competitiveness.
处理好矿业的资源联系需要能够平衡开采行为和新增能源需求的新治理模式，如联合国可持续发展目标（SDG）中所构想的。	Navigating the mining industry’s resource nexus will require new governance models that can balance extraction practices with emerging energy needs – like those envisioned by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
比如，2008年中国修改劳动法后，苹果、惠普和其他中美贸易委员会（US-China Business Council）成员成功地游说限制了中国劳工权利的扩大。	For example, when China revised its labor law in 2008, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and other members of the US-China Business Council lobbied successfully to limit the expansion of Chinese workers’ rights.
因此我们也毫不奇怪地看到，尽管在近年有所改善，但阿拉伯国家的平均文盲率却依然在30%左右徘徊，在某些国家内部甚至达到了50%或60 % 。	Not surprisingly, despite progress in recent decades, illiteracy remains at around 30% on average, and in some Arab countries reaches 50% and 60%.
目前，亚洲占全球国民生产总值38 % ， 与它在1820年的份额相比，相差甚远。 但两个国家都觉得他们能够，而且必须参与到主导世界的行列中来。	Asia’s current share of global GDP (about 38%) is still far from what it was in 1820, but both countries feel that they can – and must – participate in calling the global shots.
然而，无论原因和效果如何，只要人们决定增加开支，经济体的支出总会增长 ― ― 和其他人一样，政府决定增加开支也是好事。	Obama’s Republican opponents, who claim that fiscal stimulus cannot work, rely on arguments that are incoherent at best, and usually simply wrong, if not mendacious.
由于布什政府的政策错误和超级泡沫的破裂使中国过快地获得了过多的权势。 为了建立建设性的伙伴关系，双方都必须尽最大努力。	Due to the erroneous policies of the Bush administration and the bursting of the super-bubble, China has gained too much power too soon. For a constructive partnership, both sides will have to lean over backward.
因此，除非自由民主党人能够重振声威，否则英国可能需要一个新的政党（或跨党派联盟）去为一个外向型，自由和宽容的国家而奋斗。	So, unless the Liberal Democrats can bounce back, Britain may need a new political party (or cross-party alliance) to fight for a country that is outward-looking, liberal, and tolerant.
政治领袖们的自由度将减少，且必须在短时间内对各种事务做出回应，还要与越来越多的参与者共同争夺群众们的耳朵。	Political leaders will enjoy fewer degrees of freedom before they must respond to events, and then will have to compete with an increasing number and variety of actors in order to be heard.
这一尴尬情形的部分原因在于奥巴马在其先前的演讲中建立了太高的期望 — — 他对选民承诺会带来系统性变革。	This frustration can be blamed partly on the impossibly high expectations that Obama set in his early speeches, in which he inspired voters with promises of systemic transformation.
也正是戈尔巴乔夫宣布苏联军队不会干涉风雨飘摇的东德政府尊从其人民的意愿 — — 这堪称是一项对东德至关重要的声明。	And it was Gorbachev who proclaimed that Soviet forces would not intervene to support troubled communist regimes against the will of their people – a declaration aimed directly at East Germany.
总统奥巴马政府不去详细讨论贸易的利弊问题，而是选择强调贸易谈判中的“快车道”程序（fast-track procedures，也被称为促进贸易权限，简称TPA ） 。	Instead of discussing the detailed issues on their merits, President Barack Obama’s administration has chosen to emphasize the need for fast-track procedures (also known as trade promotion authority, or TPA) to negotiate any trade agreement.
但在一个政变和极权统治稀松平常的地区，利比里亚的进步值得庆祝，因为它为一个更美好、更民主的未来奠定了基础。	But in a region often associated with coups d’état and authoritarian rule, Liberia’s progress is worthy of celebration, as it can help to lay the foundation for a better, more democratic future.
考虑到欧洲议会与选民日常生活距离比较遥远，并且欧盟的官僚主义也饱受诟病，因此这一参与率水平以及朝向跨国政治的趋势是值得瞩目的。	Given the perceived remoteness of the European parliament and widespread frustration with the European Union’s bureaucracy, the level of participation and the movement toward transnational politics is remarkable.
但另一方面将政府与媒体企业相提并论从本质上是一种误导：任何部门承担的责任义务和肩负的期待都比不上政府。	But, on another level, the attempt to rate government alongside business and the media is fundamentally misguided: no sector operates at the scale of responsibility, accountability, and expectation that governments do.
欧洲仍存在于美国体内，只不过更多地存在于华盛顿政府和政治精英，而不是纽约金融和商业世界，尽管跨大西洋贸易对于欧洲和美国来说都具有根本重要性。	Europe still exists in the US, though probably more among the Washington administrative and political elite than within the world of New York finance and business, despite the fundamental importance of transatlantic trade for both economies.
借助LTE移动基础设施，智能手机成就了第一个内容推送平台，只要你醒着，就可以使用它，这改变了科技行业和二十亿用户的生活。	Smartphones with LTE mobile infrastructure created the first content-delivery platform that was available every waking moment, transforming the technology industry and the lives of two billion users.
在法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙最近提出这个想法后，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普对此加以诋毁（当然是在一条推文中 ） ， 但德国总理安格拉·默克尔却（在敦促保持谨慎的同时）表示赞同。	After French President Emmanuel Macron recently proposed the idea, US President Donald Trump disparaged it (in a tweet, of course), but German Chancellor Angela Merkel endorsed it (while urging caution).
事实上，恶意批评因为一个相当出乎意料的发展而受到了遏制：客户可以就服务发表观点，服务提供者也可以为客户评级，Uber就是这么做的。	Indeed, obstreperous critics are being challenged as a result of another, rather surprising development: while customers may express an opinion about a service, the service provider can also rate its customers, as Uber has demonstrated.
如今，民粹主义政治威胁着德国、法国、西班牙和英国，而意大利已经与贝卢斯科尼分道扬镳，伦齐也成功遏制了对北方联盟（Northern League）和五星运动（Five Star Movement）的支持。	While populist politics now threatens Germany, France, Spain, and Britain, Italy has turned its back on Silvio Berlusconi, and Renzi has squeezed support for the Northern League and the Five Star Movement.
不幸的是，事实证明这是错的，直言不讳地说，货币主义者对大萧条的解释在众多方面都是错误的，并且非常不完整。	Unfortunately, this turned out to be the wrong thing to do, as the monetarist interpretation of the Great Depression was, to put it bluntly, wrong in significant respects and radically incomplete.
首先，美元之所以在选举后升值，唯一原因是特朗普承诺实施深度减税并增加支出解决美国基础设施陈旧的问题和提升美国据说“耗尽”的军力。	For starters, the dollar has shot up since the election only because Trump has promised to enact deep tax cuts and ramp up spending on decaying infrastructure and America’s supposedly “depleted” military.
国际经济表现和社会进步测量委员会（International Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress，我是该委员会主席）的报告强调GDP不是衡量经济表现好坏的好指标。	The report by the International Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress (which I chaired) emphasized that GDP is not a good measure of how well an economy is performing.
2013年，0—24岁男孩数量比女孩多2,300万，这意味着在未来几十年，超过2,000万年轻男性无法找到配偶。	As of 2013, boys aged 0-24 outnumbered girls by 23 million, implying that more than 20 million young men will not be able to find marriage partners in the coming decades.
事实上，并购活动 — — 不管是数量还是交易规模 — — 在2008年全球金融危机前十分活跃，包括欧元区内部和之外的跨境并购。	In fact, M&A activity – both the number and size of transactions – was picking up before the 2008 global financial crisis, including across borders within and beyond the eurozone.
美国的联邦基金利率实际为零，而欧洲央行的主要再贷款利率虽然一直以来已经低到2 % ， 还是可能在以后的几个月中降得更低。	The Federal funds rate in the US is practically zero, and the European Central Bank’s main refinancing rate, already at an all-time low of 2%, will likely fall further in the coming months.
伊朗政权的上述分析是一个危险的误算，因为这很可能加快而不是推迟一场“热”武装对抗的爆发，而伊朗根本无法打赢这场战争。	The Iranian regime’s analysis might prove a dangerous miscalculation, because it is likely to lead sooner rather than later to a “hot” confrontation that Iran simply cannot win.
事实上，只有民主国家联合起来，才能确保这个全世界经济最有活力地区的基于规则的强大秩序和稳定的实力平衡。	In fact, only an alliance of democracies can ensure the emergence of a strong rules-based order and a stable balance of power in the world’s most economically dynamic region.
在那个阶段要对欧盟区域内的产量缺口作出预测尤其令人怀疑，因为来自不同的国际机构的数据相互差别非常大，并且后来作了很大的修正。	Estimates for the output gap of the euro area at that time were especially doubtful with data coming from different international institutions varying widely, and being revised substantially at later stages.
在幕后，她和高度专业化的德国外交使团一道加班加点争取在没有美国参与的情况下在本次G20峰会上达成共识。	Behind the scenes, she and the highly professional Germany diplomatic corps worked overtime to secure consensus – minus America – at the G20.
英国被迫在1919年4月放弃黄金兑换，这是英国准备回到从前一英镑兑换4.8665美元等价的战术性撤退。	The British were forced to abandon gold convertibility in April 1919 – a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for Britain’s return to the former $4.8665 parity with the American dollar.
对个体学校来说，这些手段将包括强化安全基础设施、准备和响应方案、训练人手、以及对学生和社区成员的教育。	For individual schools, the measures will include reinforcing security infrastructure, planning and response, training for staff, and counseling for students and community members.
对我和我的政府来说，眼前的主要任务 — — 更加努力地复兴日本经济 — — 与捍卫日本在全球和���、进步与繁荣事业中的先锋地位是不可分割的。	For me and my government, the main task ahead – working even harder to restore Japan’s economy – is inseparable from safeguarding our country’s position in the global vanguard of peace, progress, and prosperity.
为了缓和地区紧张局势，或许美国应该启动其一直逃避的与北朝鲜的直接会谈，这或许有助于解决该国政权造成的安全问题。	To reduce tensions in the region, perhaps the US should initiate long-avoided direct talks with North Korea, which could help to resolve the security issues posed by that country’s regime.
来自多数民族基库尤族的肯雅塔说，他希望弥合肯尼亚的分歧，这与其前任齐贝吉（Mwai Kibaki）的承诺异曲同工。	Kenyatta, a member of the dominant Kikuyu ethnic group, says that he wants to heal the country’s divisions, echoing the promise of his predecessor, Mwai Kibaki.
种子条约缔约国及秘书处还控制着组成国际农业研究磋商小组（CGIAR）的15家研究机构，上述研究合作机制具有全球影响力。	The Seed Treaty also brought under the control of its parties and secretariat the 15 research institutions that comprise the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), an influential global research partnership.
总体而言，较老的小国在经济和社会表现、国家贸易开放程度以及对全球化的热情程度方���都要胜过中等和大型国家 — — 这是较年轻国家所应该效仿的特征。	In general, older small countries outstrip medium-size and large countries in terms of economic and social performance, openness to international trade, and enthusiasm for globalization – features that younger countries should work to promote.
她希望得到一个强大的授权来“为英国争权益 ” ， 而这意味要与某份小报（以典型的脱欧派煽动性言词）所描述的国家利益“破坏者们”死磕。	She wants a strong mandate to “negotiate for Britain,” and that means crushing what one tabloid – in the typically incendiary rhetoric of Brexiteer populism – described as “saboteurs” of the national interest.
1989年，共产主义的崩溃让弗朗西斯·福山（Francis Fukuyama）宣布“历史的终结 ” ， 两年后，老布什总统庆祝世界大国间互相合作的“新世界秩序 ” 。	In 1989, with the collapse of communism, Francis Fukuyama announced “the end of history,” and two years later President George H. W. Bush celebrated a “new world order” of cooperation between the world’s powers.
那些需要更多样化的知识、更大规模和掌握各式技术的人员团队才能落实的技术其传播速度往往会更加缓慢或者根本无法传播开。	Technologies that require more diverse knowhow, reflected in the size and heterogeneity of the team needed to implement them, diffuse much more slowly or not at all.
最后，但不是最次要的是，目前许多人还不知道黎巴嫩现状的异常情况是，直到今天，叙利亚还不完全承认黎巴嫩作为一个主权国家的存在（在叙利亚的学校教科书中，黎巴嫩是大叙利亚的一部分 ） 。	Last but not least: it is not widely known that one anomaly of Lebanon’s status until this very day is that Syria has not fully recognized its existence as a sovereign nation (in Syrian school textbooks, Lebanon figures as part of Greater Syria).
要让一个陷入如此深度危机的国家在从现在到2020年间满足采用欧元的条件 — — 两年内通货膨胀限制在欧元区平均水平2%之内并且汇率保持稳定 — — 是无法想象的。	It is inconceivable that a country in such deep distress could meet the conditions for euro adoption – inflation within 2% of the eurozone average and a stable exchange rate for two years – between now and the end of the decade.
更为重要的是，尼日利亚已采取措施确保出售资源的获益将会被再投资，这样，在自然资源枯竭的时候，国家真正的财富 - - 固定资本和人力资本 - - 才会有所增加。	Most importantly, the Nigerians are taking measures to ensure that the fruits of this endowment are invested, so that as the country's natural resources are depleted, its real wealth - fixed and human capital - is increased.
对无家可归的预防措施既符合成本效益又符合人道，但要求人们得有足够的收入来满足其包括住房在内的基本需求。	Preventing homelessness is both cost-effective and humane, but it requires that people have adequate incomes to cover basic needs, including housing.
比赛结束时，在为惜败于强大的比利时而扼腕但又认为美国打出了一场伟大比赛的同时，我的新朋友说 ： “ 我们需要的远不止于此 。 ”	At the end of the game, amid regret over the loss to mighty Belgium but convinced that the US had played a great game, my new friend said: “We need much more of this.”
尽管最新公布的《美国贸易代表就中国遵守WTO规则状况呈交国会的报告》中有足量证据支撑这些指控，但这种惩罚性行动将为美国企业和消费者带来严重的后果。	While there may well be merit to the allegations, as documented in the latest “USTR Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance,” punitive action would have serious consequences for US businesses and consumers.
随着每个国家都选择性地拒绝某些条文，这份《协议》的目标将最终被极大弱化以确保获得通过，自然也无法奢望能取得多少实质性成果了。	After every country has received its “opt-out,” and the Competitiveness Pact’s targets have been sufficiently diluted to ensure its passage, there will most likely be very little of substance left.
张成泽是支撑濒临崩溃的朝鲜经济的关键人物，他被处决使人们严重怀疑朝鲜政权的稳定性，担心这个拥有大规模杀伤性武器的王朝崩溃。	Given Chang’s pivotal role in steering North Korea’s moribund economy, his execution raised serious doubts about the regime’s stability – raising fears of the collapse of a dynasty that possesses weapons of mass destruction.
美国人整天受到行业资助的媒体的狂轰滥炸，淡化气候变化问题，而化石燃料比美国匮乏得多的国家一开始着手进行迈向低碳未来的必要转型。	Americans are bombarded by industry-funded media downplaying climate change, while countries that are much poorer in fossil fuels are already making the necessary transition to a low-carbon future.
与此同时，俄罗斯将坚持得体的传统价值，索契市长帕霍莫夫（Anatoly Pakhomov）告诉BBC“敝市没有[同性恋 ] 。 ”	Russia, meanwhile, will uphold decent traditional values. As the mayor of Sochi, Anatoly Pakhomov, informed the BBC, “we do not have [homosexuals] in our city.”
哥伦比亚政府过渡司法体制结束冲突并重新吸收哥伦比亚革命武装力量加入哥伦比亚政治进程不可避免地有一些批评者，并在哥伦比亚选民当中造成一定的分歧。	Inevitably, the Colombian government’s transitional-justice regime to end the conflict and re-assimilate the FARC into the Colombian political process has some detractors, and has divided the Colombian electorate.
欧洲央行所宣称的目标是通过购买超过1.1万亿欧元的资产让欧元区实现再通胀，从而���低欧元的对外价值。	The ECB’s stated goal is to reflate the eurozone, thereby reducing the euro’s external value, by purchasing more than €1.1 trillion worth of assets.
这种说法挑战了“华盛顿共识 ” ， 该共识宣称只有私有化、解除劳动力市场管制、实现金融自由化、国际经济融合和建立在低通胀基础上的宏观经济稳定才是实现经济发展的唯一出路。	This challenges the Washington Consensus, with its one-size-fits-all formula of privatization, deregulated labor markets, financial liberalization, international economic integration, and macroeconomic stability based on low inflation.
发自北京 — — 今年6月，中国人民银行宣布结束持续了23个月的人民币/美元汇率挂钩，并重新恢复到危机发生前2005年7月颁布实施的汇率管理办法。	BEIJING – In June, the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBC), China’s central bank, announced an end to the renminbi’s 23-month-old peg to the dollar and a return to the pre-crisis exchange-rate regime adopted in July 2005.
众所周知，我们正在转向新增长模式，新模式更加审慎、更加可持续，更少依赖化石燃料，更多依赖可再生能源资源。	We all know that we are headed toward a new growth model – one that is more sober and sustainable, that depends less on fossil fuels and more on renewable energy sources.
事实上，关税从很多角度看属于昨天的问题 — — 至少曾经如此，直到特朗普把它们拿出来作为贸易战的武器之一。	Indeed, in many ways, tariffs are yesterday’s problem – at least they were, until Trump dusted them off as a weapon for his trade war.
是的，许多地方都有泡沫，无论是上海和迪拜的房产还是孟买的股票，但同时也有严肃认真的长期计划，可能使这些国家在未来若干年内都处于强势。	Yes, there are bubbles here and there, whether it is real estate in Shanghai and Dubai or stocks in Mumbai, but there has also been serious long-range planning that is likely to give these countries a strong position for years to come.
具体到标准而言，主要国家一致认为网络战争应受武装冲突规则的管辖，即要求区分军事和民用目标，并在袭击后果方面遵循对应原则。	As for norms, major states have agreed that cyber war will be limited by the law of armed conflict, which requires discrimination between military and civilian targets and proportionality in terms of consequences.
风险在于 — — 如20世纪80年代的拉美和90年代的亚洲 — — 私人部门违约将影响到公共部门资产负债表。	The risk is that – as in Latin America in the 1980s and Asia in the 1990s – private-sector defaults will infect public-sector balance sheets.
意大利人的税收负担已经相当繁重：一名年收入50,000欧元的纳税人需缴纳15,000欧元的所得税；有两个孩子的纳税人税额仅减少1,000欧元。	Italians already shoulder heavy taxes: an individual taxpayer with annual income of €50,000 pays €15,000 in income tax; with two children, that total drops by only €1,000.
“当今最有用的公民权形式 ， ” 一位分析师向她呛声 ， “ 就是不但要致力于伯克希尔教区的福祉，也要致力于整个地球的福祉 。 ”	“The most useful form of citizenship these days,” one analyst lectured her, “is one dedicated not only to the wellbeing of a Berkshire parish, say, but to the planet.”
法国欧盟宪法草案全民公决前的运动中，欧盟建议的有关服务业的指令被诬蔑为破坏劳动者权利，而这一指控通过“波兰管道工”吓人的形象体现出来。	During the referendum campaign in France preceding the vote on the draft EU Constitutional Treaty, the proposed directive was vilified as undermining the rights of labor, symbolized by that dreaded bogeyman, the “Polish plumber.”
七年前，当美国站边反对巴沙尔后，在它在叙利亚主张国家利益时，一直忽略了土耳其、俄罗斯、伊朗和以色列等其他重要行动方的利益。	When the US took a side against Assad seven years ago, it was asserting its national interest in Syria while ignoring the interests of other key players such as Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Israel.
因为监管者的决策会影响个人的财产权 — — 而它们的行动或者疏忽可能令纳税人陷入援助银行的圈套 — — 因此政府，议会和法院都必须要小心管好这只看门狗。	Because supervisors’ decisions affect individuals’ property rights – and their actions or omissions can put taxpayers on the hook to bail out banks – governments, parliaments, and the courts are bound to hold the watchdogs on a tight leash.
克里姆林宫认为，现在是低价购买资产，并利用当前的金融危机使俄罗斯以一个强大的全球经济参与者的姿态出现的时候。	The Kremlin thinks that now is the time to buy assets cheaply, using the current financial crisis to emerge as a powerful global economic player.
而且，最近有消息指出在2016年马纳福特仍担任竞选主席期间，他提出为某俄罗斯寡头提供有关总统竞选现状的情况汇报。	Also, it was recently revealed that in 2016, while Manafort was still campaign chair, he offered to conduct briefings for a Russian oligarch about the presidential campaign.
阿纳斯这样的难民在行使对摆脱贫困必不可少的权利时苦苦挣扎 — — 包括教育、医疗、行动自由、就业、土地和住所。	Refugees like Anas struggle to exercise precisely those rights – to education, health care, freedom of movement, and access to work, land, and housing – that are essential to escaping poverty.
在中国和其他现存的亚洲独裁国家中，人们、甚至那些自诩为“自由派”人士已经惯于争辩说民主可能对欧美国家是好事，但是它并不适用于亚洲传统。	In China, and other remaining areas of Asian authoritarianism, it has become customary, even among some self-professed “liberals,” to argue that democracy may be fine for Europeans and Americans, but is unsuited to Asian conditions.
多亏紧急行动中心的设立，这些基础设施甚至通过追踪和监控接触者，协助阻止了2014年尼日利亚埃博拉疫情的爆发。	Thanks to the emergency operations centers, this infrastructure even helped to stop the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria in 2014, by enabling contact tracing and surveillance.
许多外部人士担心日本的债务，在今天普遍低利率的环境中，债务很容易维持，但如果利率上升至更加正常的水平，维持债务的难度也将增加。	Many outsiders worry about Japan’s debt, which is easy to service at the low interest rates prevailing today, but would not be if rates increased to more normal levels.
欧洲央行的现任行长Jean-Claude Trichet与其前任Wim Duisenberg所处的环境达不相同。 这位前任曾说出“我听到政客们的言论，但却并不听从”这句名言。	Jean-Claude Trichet, the current ECB president, may be in the same job but not the same environment as his predecessor Wim Duisenberg, who famously remarked, “I hear the politicians, but I don’t listen.”
另一方面，鉴于美欧与俄罗斯在核安全不扩散、恐怖主义、太空、北极和伊朗阿富汗问题上的共同利益，让俄国陷入彻底孤立不是明智的选择。	On the other hand, it is important not to isolate Russia completely, given shared interests with the US and Europe relating to nuclear security and non-proliferation, terrorism, space, the Artic, and Iran and Afghanistan.
2015年阿拉伯人类发展报告与2002年报告主题十分相似，但这次我们直接接触了有影响力的阿拉伯年轻人，以便获取尽可能详实的数据，并重点关注了吞噬阿拉伯地区的战争的后果。	The 2015 AHDR shared similar themes with its 2002 precursor, but this time we engaged more directly with influential Arab youth to compile the best data possible, and to put a spotlight on the effects of the wars engulfing the region.
正在亚美尼亚访问的欧洲理事会会议大会主席罗素·约翰斯通勋爵在与当局的一次谈话中发表了他对我的案件的看法，使政府下令取消把我送进监狱的决定。	Lord Johnston expressed his opinion about my case in his talks with the authorities, which then decided not to send me to prison.
很多人垂死挣扎，这时，一位叫做迪利普·马哈拉纳比斯（Dilip Mahalanabis）的医生在绝望之中放手一搏。	As many people lay dying, a pioneering doctor named Dilip Mahalanabis took a chance in a desperate situation.
问题在于老欧洲党派的知识和道德基础在最近几年快速削弱，部分原因在于它们没能 — — 或无力 — — 适应欧洲层面的制度。	The problem is that the old European parties’ intellectual and moral foundations have rapidly eroded in recent years, owing partly to their failure – or inability – to adapt to EU-level systems.
“十几岁 ” （ 15—19岁）应该大部分还在学校中；如非如此，则可能技能极低，因而即便在好光景时也难以找到全职工作。	The “teenagers” (15-19 years old) should mostly still be in school; if not, they are likely to be very low skilled – and thus to have difficulty finding a full-time job even in good times.
据IMF计算，快速而出乎意料地一次性征收10%的财富税可以让许多欧洲国家的债务/GDP比率回到危机前水平。	The IMF calculates that a one-time 10% wealth levy, if introduced quickly and unexpectedly, could return many European countries to pre-crisis public debt/GDP ratios.
相对于公共部门来说私人投资者较为短视，导致了“刚刚好诅咒（curse of good enough ） ” ，其往往倾向于维持而不是替换和升级基础设施。	Private investors’ shorter time horizon relative to the public sector has given rise to the “curse of good enough,” with incentives skewed toward maintaining rather than replacing and upgrading infrastructure.
他认为，这将带来分裂和反动政治 ： “ 没有转移支付，你就无法让外围趋同，这将造成走向极端化的政治分歧 。 ”	That, he believes, is a recipe for disintegration and reactionary politics: “Without transfers, you will not allow the periphery to converge and will create political divergence towards extremists.”
希望围绕截然不同的新思想、忠诚和行为模式塑造社会的领导人首先必须摧毁成年人的现有身份，并阻止将这些身份传递给儿童。	Leaders wishing to mold a society around a new and different set of ideas, loyalties, and forms of behavior first need to destroy adults’ existing identities and prevent the transmission of these identities to children.
警方被控过度使用武力驱逐史坦丁洛克（Standing Rock）苏族部落及其支持者，他们认为管道工程将污染水源，破坏宝贵的墓葬。	Police were accused of using excessive force to try to disperse members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their supporters, who argued that the project would contaminate water and damage sacred burial sites.
哈佛大学的理查德·库珀（Richard Cooper）曾经观察到，在国际公共卫生合作的早期阶段，对全球疾病的治理因为各国存在不同的传染模式而大受掣肘。	Richard Cooper of Harvard University once observed that in the early days of international public health cooperation, the fight against global diseases was hampered by countries’ adherence to different models of contagion.
事实上毛里求斯有许多方面的经验，其中有些是美国以及其他在预算斗争中挣扎的国家的政治家们应该牢记于心的。	There are, in fact, many lessons, some of which should be borne in mind by politicians in the US and elsewhere as they fight their budget battles.
但除了极少数例外，政客们一直在支持他 — — 出于相似的原因：掌权并给他们的支持者赚更多的钱符合他们的狭隘私利。	But with only a few exceptions, the politicians continue to support him – and for a similar reason: their narrow self-interest in staying in power and making more money for their backers.
鉴于其历史、文化以及传统，包括其在前苏联中重要、独立乃至反叛精神，格鲁吉亚看起来都是成功民主化的理想候选人。	With its history, culture, and traditions – including its critical, independent, and even rebellious spirit within the former Soviet Union – Georgia would seem to be an ideal candidate for successful democratization.
习近平的自信不但反映出中国领导层对普京治理俄罗斯经济不力的不屑，也体现了中国能源顾虑最近已大为缓解的事实。	Xi’s self-confidence reflected not only the Chinese leadership’s contempt for Putin’s mismanagement of the Russian economy, but also the fact that China’s energy worries have lessened considerably of late.
日本消费电子产品制造商不再能够执世界之牛耳的一个原因就在于它们没有充分利用管理岗位上的妇女员工，尽管她们拥有丰富的经验。	One reason that Japan’s consumer electronics manufacturers are no longer world-beaters is that they have not fully used their female employees in managerial positions, despite their varied experiences.
但欧尔班本人曾在索罗斯奖学金的资助下在牛津大学就读（我现在担任牛津大学的校长 ） ， 并曾经跟随伟大的自由思想家以赛亚·柏林学习。	Yet Orbán himself attended the University of Oxford (where I am Chancellor) on a Soros-funded scholarship, and studied there under the great liberal thinker Isaiah Berlin.
结果，即使是表面上独立或私人的行为，也会给西方组织带来政治和名誉风险，有可能被指控成为中国“影响力的代理人 ” 。	As a result, even ostensibly independent or private activities can carry political and reputational risks for Western organizations, which may be accused of acting as “agents of influence” for China.
中国的目光现在放在两个目标上 — — 到2035年完成建设所谓小康社会的任务（报告原文为“在全面建成小康社会的基础上，再奋斗十五年，基本实现社会主义现代化 ” ） ，然后在2050年前建成一个强国。	China’s sights are now set on two goals – completing the task of building the so-called moderately prosperous society by 2035, and then establishing its position as a Great Power by 2050.
德国是唯一一个例外，但在地缘战略问题上还算不上重量级角色；虽然日本最了解核战争的恐怖，但国内依然有重要势力呼吁改变其无核态度。	Germany is an exception, though hardly a geostrategic heavyweight; and though Japan knows the horror of nuclear war, important domestic voices there are calling for a change of its non-nuclear status.
拜中国的地理、人口和经济规模所赐 ， “ 改革开放 ” （ 邓小平语）和技术进步很自然地降低了交易成本，改善了市场的资源配置力。	Thanks to China’s geographic, demographic, and economic scale, “reform and opening up,” in Deng’s phrase, and technological progress naturally drive down transaction costs, improving markets’ capacity to allocate resources.
亚穆苏克罗 — — 每年用于非洲援助的数十亿美元或许能给非洲大陆带来很多好处，但却无法彻底解决贫困问题。	YAMOUSSOUKRO – The billions of dollars in aid delivered to Africa annually may do the continent much good, but it cannot deliver a solution to poverty.
伦敦—联合国气候谈判在截止日期之后、眼看就要谈崩时才能达成紧张的、充满争议的妥协，这似乎已经成了惯例。	LONDON – It seems to have become a ritual for United Nations climate negotiations to reach the brink of collapse before an intense, contentious compromise is achieved after the deadline.
我们的贷款工具比以前更加灵活了，以便金融支持能够更快地抵达成员国，为它们创造空间进行急需支出支持增长、保护最脆弱人群。	We have made our lending instruments more flexible, so that financial support can reach our members quickly, leaving sufficient room for high-priority spending to support growth and protect the most vulnerable.
这表明“德尼索瓦人”一定不仅仅存在于西伯利亚，也存在于东南亚路径上，早期现代人经此路径抵达假想的杂交发生地 — — 澳大拉西亚。	This indicates that the “Denisovans” must have existed not just in Siberia, but also along the southeast Asian route that early modern humans used to reach Australasia, where the hypothesized hybridization occurred.
叙利亚、伊拉克和利比亚已经名存实亡；它们各自有非常重要的部分已经事实自治并自力更生，不管结果是好是坏。	Syria, Iraq, and Libya are likely to be countries in name only; important parts of each will essentially be autonomous and on their own, for better or worse.
乌克兰目前以每一千立方米179美元的价格购买俄罗斯的天然气，此价格是它2004年支付价格的三倍多，而且据说莫斯科正考虑把价格再提高一倍。	Ukraine currently pays $179 per 1,000 cubic meters for gas from Russia - more than three times what it paid in 2004 - and there have been reports that Moscow is considering a further doubling of the price.
而且，空袭虽然可能会将伊朗的核计划推迟几年，但也会促使民族主义者团结起来支持政府和核计划，特别是在一次打击不够的情况下。	Moreover, while an air strike might set back Iran’s program by a few years, it would solidify nationalist support for the government and the nuclear program, particularly because one attack would not be enough.
我们应该探索所有选项，如用无人机空投食品和药品供给、开发移动应用监控需要和追踪供给情况，以及保证援助工作者的安全。	We should be exploring every option, such as using drones to airdrop food and medical supplies, and developing mobile apps to monitor needs and track supplies on the ground, and to keep aid workers safer.
黑死病迄今为止仍然普遍存在于人们的想象之中，这种病于14世纪40年代来源于中亚，并在短短几年时间内消灭了感染地区近半数的人口。	The Black Death, which lives on in popular imagination to this day, arrived from Central Asia in the 1340s, and in the space of a few years, wiped out roughly half of the population in the regions it struck.
在成为只不过是换上另一张标签的布什政府的延续的海报女郎时，佩林显示出她自己与贝隆夫人或者丹麦的反移民运动领袖柯丝高这些老于世故的伪民粹主义者有相当多的共同点。	In becoming the poster girl for a re-branded continuation of the Bush administration, Palin is showing herself to have much in common with glossy faux-populists like Eva Peron or Denmark’s anti-immigrant leader Pia Kjærsgaard.
一次大战的战败令德国陷入动荡，1919年的严酷和平、20年代的恶性通胀、30年代的大萧条，否则德国不会如此。	Germany was destabilized by defeat in World War I, a harsh peace in 1919, hyperinflation in the 1920's, and the Great Depression of the 1930's, but was otherwise not uniquely barbarous.
但是，日本首相安倍晋三最近呼吁与中国就这一问题进行谈判，这表明TPP并未对中国 — — 或其他亚洲经济体关死大门。	But, as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s recent call for talks with China on the issue confirm, the TPP is not off-limits to China – or to other Asian economies.
这一对策并不意味者马上就让奥巴马和伊朗最高领导人哈梅内伊或者总统内贾德坐下来会谈。 首先要进行大量的准备工作。	Such an approach does not mean having Obama sit down with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei or President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad anytime soon.
这些影响对于这个星球上生活最贫困的那些人群所带来的打击显然最大，尽管这些“生活在底层的十亿人口”已经承受了疾病、贫困、战争冲突和营养不良等所带来的沉重负担。	These impacts will clearly hit the planet’s worst-off inhabitants hardest: the “bottom billion” who already bear the heaviest burden of disease, poverty, conflict and malnutrition.
贸易和货币协议总算仍有达成，但越来越多地以地区或双边协议的形式达成，而非有利于范围更广的地缘政治目标的多边协定。	Trade and monetary agreements are still reached, but they increasingly take the form of regional and bilateral deals, rather than multilateral arrangements, thereby serving broader geopolitical goals.
中俄因势利导的联姻是否能产生一个持久的联盟 — — 或者如乔治·索罗斯（George Soros）预言的那样形成世界和平的威胁 — — 仍有待观察。	Whether their marriage of convenience will lead to an enduring union – or, as George Soros predicts, a threat to world peace – remains to be seen.
但那些说合作性国��政策不可行的人没有说的是，合作性国际政策看上去永远不可行，直到突然有一天条件改变了，所有东西都走上了正轨。	But what those who say that coordinated international policy is impossible don’t say is that coordinating international policy always looks impossible, until suddenly the conditions change and everything falls into place.
马克思的社会主义虽已市场饱和，但他有一个主张还是对的：全球化、无约束的金融资本主义、收入和财富由劳动向资本转移，会导致资本主义的自我毁灭。	Karl Marx oversold socialism, but he was right in claiming that globalization, unfettered financial capitalism, and redistribution of income and wealth from labor to capital could lead capitalism to self-destruct.
事实上，这一动作应该是受欢迎的政治和道德一致性信号，甚至可以增强埃尔多安促成与包括PKK在内的土耳其库尔德人的安排的筹码。	Indeed, such a move could be a welcome sign of political and moral consistency, possibly even boosting Erdoğan’s leverage in devising an arrangement with Turkey’s Kurds, including the PKK.
而奥巴马也是在对他的前任小布什拨乱反正。 小布什总是危险地把触手伸得过长，其掀起的全球反恐战争就是明证。	Obama, for his part, was reacting to his own predecessor, George W. Bush, whose tendency toward dangerous overreach was exemplified in his Global War on Terror.
不管特朗普决定采取什么行动，他都必须认识到，这些行动所牵涉到的利益 — — 不仅仅是对朝鲜半岛，也包括美国和中国的关系 — — 是非常巨大的。	Whatever action Trump decides to take, he must recognize that the stakes – not just for the Korean Peninsula, but also for America’s relationship with China – could not be higher.
他获得了决定性选举胜利，连续第三次出任总理，他的右翼利库德集团在以色列议会中获得比主要对手、中左翼的犹太复国主义联盟（Zionist Union）多五个的席位，这几乎让所有人大跌眼镜。	He surprised nearly everyone by securing a decisive electoral victory, winning a third consecutive term in office after his right-wing Likud party gained a five-seat advantage in the Knesset over its main rival, the center-left Zionist Union.
欧盟的建立本是为了打破欧洲民族主义的破坏性循环 — — 导致两次世界大战的两大极权制度的崛起都是拜这一循环所赐 — — 后来它也成为人类世界秩序的样板。	The EU, established to break the destructive cycle of European nationalism that had facilitated the rise of two totalitarian systems and caused two world wars, amounted to the creation of a prototype of a humane world order.
如今问题已经被清晰地表述出来，人们可以感觉到的不仅是两党之间的一纸宏观协议，而是几乎实实在在的交替。	Now that the problem has been articulated, one can sense not only general agreement, but almost palpable relief.
当乔治·布什灾难性的8年任期过去之后，巴拉克·奥巴马正式入主白宫，有一段时间美国仿佛有能力遏制住下滑的颓势。	When, after the eight catastrophic years of George W. Bush’s presidency, Barack Obama entered the White House, it seemed for a moment as if America might be able to arrest its downward slide.
特朗普的新国家贸易委员会主任彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro）指责德国用“大幅低估”的“隐性德国马克”掠夺它的贸易伙伴。	Peter Navarro, director of Trump’s new National Trade Council, has accused Germany of exploiting its trading partners, with an “implicit Deutsche Mark” that is “grossly undervalued.”
而德国应当临时减税 — — 而不是像计划中那样增税 — — 以便增加可支配收入并刺激德国对周边地区商品和服务的需求。	And Germany should cut taxes temporarily – rather than raising taxes, as planned – in order to increase disposable income and stimulate German demand for the periphery’s goods and services.
叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的阿拉维派少数民族政权毫不吝惜地对协议表示赞美，因为他们意识到国际合法性和财政状况改善将使什叶派伊朗为其提供更有力的支持。	Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s minority Alawite regime lavished praise on the agreement, rightly recognizing that enhanced international legitimacy and financial resources will enable Shia Iran to provide greater backing.
南非内阁正准备最终敲定一项极大扩大药物获取渠道的知识产权政策，为此该国无疑将面临来自富裕国家的各种双边和多边压力。	The South African cabinet is preparing to finalize an IP policy that promises to expand access to medicines substantially. South Africa will now undoubtedly face all manner of bilateral and multilateral pressure from wealthy countries.
法国公共支出并不亚于斯堪的纳维亚水平（高达GDP的56 % ） ，但法国家庭所付出的消费和个人所得税率更低。	While French public spending – which stood at 56% of GDP in 2011 – is at or above Scandinavian levels, French households pay lower tax rates on consumption and personal income.
但人们以往与异常物种打交道的经验和最近有关肿瘤进化动力学的数学模型告诉我们，彻底治愈绝大多数癌症可能是不现实的目标。	Yet lessons learned in dealing with exotic species, combined with recent mathematical models of the evolutionary dynamics of tumors, indicate that eradicating most cancers may be impossible.
耶路撒冷 — — 就在内塔尼亚胡总理解雇两名资深内阁部长短短一天后，以色列议会的解散标志着一个出人意料的转机。	JERUSALEM – The dissolution of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, just a day after Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu sacked two senior cabinet ministers, marks a surprising turnabout.
尽管我们目前在防止年轻人因癌症而死亡方面取得了巨大的成功，但这种成功却是一种“浮士德式交易”的结果。	While we are phenomenally successful at keeping young people from dying of cancer today, that success comes as a Faustian bargain.
这就是为何我国政府正在利用它来了解运输部门 — — 以及农业，能源和其他部门 — — 如何影响缓解气候变化的相关战略。	That is why my government is using it to understand how sectors like transportation – as well as agriculture, energy, and others – are affecting strategies to mitigate climate change.
类似记者内迪姆·萨纳尔（Nedim Sener）和警官哈内非·阿维西（Hanefi Avci）这样的知名囚犯都是因为揭露了谷兰派警察和检察官的���误行径而当啷入狱的。	Prominent detainees, such as the journalist Nedim Sener and police commissioner Hanefi Avci, landed in jail after exposing the wrongdoings of Gülenist police and prosecutors.
2004年，在为获得激进伊斯兰领导人中最大影响力而竞争的Bangla Bhai在几个与印度接壤的地区发起伊斯兰革命。	Competing for influence among radical Islamist leaders in northwestern Bangladesh is Bangla Bhai, who in 2004 attempted an Islamist revolution in several provinces bordering India.
正如经济学家琼·罗宾逊夫人在1947年所指出的，几乎所有汇率都是这些其他变量的某种混合体的平衡价值。	As the economist Joan Robinson pointed out in 1947, just about any exchange rate will be the equilibrium value for some combination of these other variables.
首先，基奇洛夫把阿根廷2001年债务违约和2008年全球金融危机间经济快速增长的年份归因为国内总需求的凯恩斯主义景气恢复。	First, Kicillof attributed Argentina’s rapid economic growth in the years between its 2001 debt default and the 2008 global financial crisis to a Keynesian reflation of domestic aggregate demand.
奥巴马在2008年的当选使人们对这一地区也期望颇高，但其政府对拉美的方针至多只能算有所保留，时不时出些昏招。	Barack Obama’s 2008 election created high expectations in this region, too; but his administration’s approach has been reserved, at best, and often obtuse.
这些现实帮助说服了凯文·安德森（Kevin Anderson）和格伦·彼得斯（Glen Peters）等科学家最近将除碳称为一场“不公平的高赌注赌局 ” 。	These realities helped persuade the scientists Kevin Anderson and Glen Peters recently to call carbon removal an “unjust and high-stakes gamble.”
有人认为是解放军地方指挥官下令挑起了这次“僵局 ” ， 也有人助长中国新主席习近平在借此宣布他在解放军中的权威。	Some claim that the local PLA commander initiated the “stand-off,” while others contend that China’s new president, Xi Jinping, was using the transgression to assert his authority over the PLA.
期望中国和印度在受益很小的情况下进行大规模的碳排放减排，会将哥本哈根会议置于一条肯定是另一个失去的机会的道路之上。	Expecting China and India to make massive emission cuts for little benefit puts the Copenhagen meeting on a sure path to being another lost opportunity.
脱藕一说是建立在经济状况变坏以及某些欧洲人不愿意接受欧洲短暂但却甜蜜的经济扩张同样也在走向尽头的基础上的。	Decoupling is an idea that is based on bad economics – and on some Europeans’ reluctance to accept the fact that Europe’s short but sweet economic expansion is also coming to an end.
虽然流感病毒可以导致所有年龄段的人患病，但65岁及以上的老年人从死亡和住院等角度考量所受影响最大，而且年龄越大风险就越高。	While the influenza virus can cause disease in people of all ages, the elderly – those 65 and above – are disproportionately affected, in terms of both death and hospitalization, with the oldest being at the greatest risk.
加利福尼亚人必须要在成年人自由权，对少数群体的保护，防止大规模黑市交易，财政因素以及保护大麻使用者的健康之间作出取舍。	Californians will have to decide how much weight to give to respect for adult liberty, protection of minors, avoidance of a large-scale black market, fiscal considerations, and protection of marijuana users’ health.
目前，最佳前景似乎是罗马历史学家塔西佗所描述的 — — “他们制造了一片沙漠，他们管它叫和平 。 ”	At the moment, the best outlook appears to be that described by the Roman historian Tacitus – “they make a desert, they call it peace.”
他们往往会夸大那些证明该模型的因素同时贬低那些与模型相抵触的新证据 — — 这种现象叫做“证实性偏见 ” 。	They tend to exaggerate the support for the model and discount new evidence that contradicts it – a phenomenon known as “confirmation bias.”
巴西驻世贸组织特使罗伯托·阿泽维多（Roberto Azevedo）最近发言说巴西“反对声称WTO组织的信誉和合法性正在多哈回合中消亡的说法没，因为WTO比多哈回合的规模更大，而且位居其上 ” 。	Brazil’s ambassador to the WTO, Roberto Azevedo, said recently that his country “rejects the notion that this organization’s credibility and legitimacy are in a death embrace with the Round. The WTO is bigger than the Round and transcends it.”
因为这一混淆，教皇方济各和东正教普世首牧马塞洛缪要求我们深入思考什么才是对人类的真正的益（good ） ， 以及如何获得它。	This confusion is why Pope Francis and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew are spurring us to think deeply about what is truly good for humanity, and how to attain it.
其次是选举，也将在2014年进行。 这次选举将选出新的阿富汗总统 — — 美国及其北约盟友需要这样一个程序来振振有词地宣布它们把阿富汗交给了一个合法的政府。	The second is the election, also to be held in 2014, of a new Afghan president – a process that needs to permit the United States and its NATO allies to claim plausibly that they are handing the country over to a legitimate government.
但这意味着军队将回归到政治核心 — — 进而牺牲掉强化民众控制这一穆尔西去年8月当选以来的最大进步。	But this would mean returning the army to the center of politics – and thus sacrificing the gains from Morsi’s imposition last August of greater civilian control.
“里斯本战略”的成形在很大程度上要归功于奥地利经济学家Joseph Schumpeter，他的理念是利润源自创新。	The Lisbon Strategy owes much to the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, who claimed that profit results from innovation.
观察同一国的经常项目赤字，计算需要真实贬值多大幅度（需要做一些关于贸易弹性的假设）方能填补这一外部缺口。	Take the same country’s current-account deficit and ask how large a real depreciation is needed (making some assumptions about trade elasticities along the way) to close that external gap.
今天，阿萨德遭到人们的辱骂，内贾德政府被指责暴力镇压支持民主的抗议者，真主党和伊朗则由于继续支持阿萨德而被谴责，因为阿萨德屠杀害当地的居民。	Today, Assad is reviled, Ahmadinejad’s government is accused of violently suppressing its own pro-democracy protestors, and both Hezbollah and Iran are condemned for continuing to back Assad as he slaughters his own population.
这意味着将大部分收入能力转交给地方将是英国的一个大错，因为这样做将使英国存在一个没有财政支持的银行联盟。	This implies that transferring the majority of revenue-raising capacity to the regions would be a mistake for the UK, because doing so would give the country a banking union without a fiscal backstop.
美联储对欧洲的支持也令人瞩目，因为当时美国政府的其余部门事实上都是旁观者 — — 光说不练，并没有为欧元区受困经济体提供真金白银。	The Fed’s support for Europe was similarly remarkable, because the rest of the US government was an ineffective bystander at the time – able to offer cheap counsel but little hard cash to the eurozone’s distressed economies.
也许亚洲会将欧洲人视作威尼斯的政治翻版¾¾一个带着怀旧心情去感伤昔日辉煌并瞻仰其博物馆般实质的地方。	Perhaps Asians would then come to regard the European model as a political version of Venice – a place to visit with nostalgia for its past glory and admiration for its museum-like quality.
反击必须在受到攻击后以自卫为目的，或者为了应对可能发生的直接威胁而采取自卫行动，无论是上述哪种情况，都不可能有时间去讨论非致命的替代行动。	They must be conducted either in self-defense after an attack, or in anticipatory self-defense against an immediate threat, when taking time to discuss non-lethal alternatives is not feasible.
因此产生的相关风险是加息太慢可能导致资产价格泡沫化以及其他所有风险 — — 信贷市场冻结，失业率骤升，消费下滑等等 — — 都是由于其不可避免的通货紧缩所引发的。	A related risk is that increasing rates too slowly could lead to an asset-price bubble and all the dangers – frozen credit markets, soaring unemployment, plummeting consumption, and more – implied by its inevitable deflation.
泰国的经验表明，通过阻挠多数派意愿颠覆制度的举动最终不会产生效果，只能徒然给所有人带来及其高昂的成本。	Thailand’s experience suggests that efforts to subvert the system by thwarting the will of the majority may ultimately be fruitless, though not before imposing extremely high costs on everyone.
而中国那种充满活力，更现代也更全球化的经济与其缺乏透明度的一党执政体制之间的不平衡状态也日益加深，在许多西方专家看来，这种矛盾对立将不可避免地使中国走向危机。	As the imbalance between China’s ever more dynamic, modern, and globalized economy and its opaque, single-party system of political rule deepened, many Western specialists predicted that the contradiction would inevitably trip China up.
即使当局像其应该做的那样给硬性要求银行的大债权人承担大量损失，北部各国的纳税人也要被迫注入大量的资金到各大银行。	Northern taxpayers will be forced to inject massive amounts of capital into banks, even if the authorities impose significant losses on banks’ large and wholesale creditors, as well they should.
上述状况在2005年发生了改变，世贸组织与贸易相关的知识产权协定（TRIPS）迫使印度建立了药品专利制度。	That changed in 2005, when the WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) forced India to allow drug patents.
预期的市场回报率是这一数值加上或减去预期的估值比变化：股票收益会随着市盈率提升而增加，抑或随着市盈率降低而减少？	The expected market return is that amount plus or minus expected changes in valuation ratios: will stocks return more as price-earnings ratios rise, or return less as price-earnings ratios fall?
当按揭债务高水平遇上房价崩盘时，就会引起巨大的社会和经济成本，因此，监管者理应对这一问题全力以赴、密切关注。	Given the enormous social and economic costs when high levels of mortgage debt meet a crash in house prices, one would expect regulators to be fully engaged on the issue.
比如，2009年，一名叫谢尔盖·马格尼茨基（Sergei Magnitsky）的律师在揭露俄罗斯官员的退税欺诈后被控盗用公款。	In 2009, for example, Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer, was accused of embezzlement after uncovering a fraudulent tax-refund scheme run by Russian officials.
当福克斯新闻的比尔·奥雷利最近指责安妮斯顿拍摄的一部描绘单身母亲的影片 — — 播种爱情 — — 似乎在对十二三岁的女孩子们说 ， ‘ 你们不需要男人’时，他其实是对的。	When Bill O’Reilly of Fox News recently accused Aniston of making a movie about single motherhood – The Switch – that seems to say “to a twelve or thirteen year old girl, ‘You don’t need a man,’” he is right.
安·兰德（Ayn Rand）用其1957年的名著《阿特拉斯耸耸肩 》 （ Atlas Shrugged）中的绝望诅咒给出了答案 ： “ 谁是约翰·高特（John Galt ） ？ ”	The answer lies in Ayn Rand’s rhetorical invocation of despair in her 1957 epic Atlas Shrugged: “Who is John Galt?”
对西方石油公司而言，传统策略应该是停止石油勘探，通过向石油生产国提供设备、地理技能和新科技（如液压致裂法）挖掘利润。	For Western oil companies,the rational strategy will be to stop oil exploration and seek profits by providing equipment, geological knowhow, and new technologies such as hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) to oil-producing countries.
· 我们必须降低因为将核力量保持在“准备发射”状态而带来的风险，保持“准备发射”状态意味着它们随时都可以立即发射，在几分钟内击毁目标。	· We must reduce the risks associated with keeping nuclear forces on “prompt-launch” status, whereby they are ready for immediate launch and can hit their targets within minutes.
比如，在上个月的达沃斯世界经济论坛年会上，美国财政部长史蒂文·努钦（Steven Mnuchin）积极评价了弱势美元，称其为提振美国贸易的手段。	For example, at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos last month, US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin spoke positively about a weaker dollar as a way to boost US trade.
但普京的隐含意思 — — 他正在乌克兰重打二战，俄罗斯将再次拯救犹太人和世界于民族主义迫害者及其欧洲（读作：德国/纳粹）赞助人之手 — — 是决不可信的。	But Putin’s implied argument that in Ukraine he is refighting WWII, with Russia once again rescuing Jews and the world from nationalist pogromists and their European (read: German/ Nazi) sponsors is simply not credible.
否则，由于欧元区改革的政治和经济之间存在不可分割的联系，财政扩张将与货币决策者的努力一样对提振增长毫无效果。	Otherwise, given that the politics and economics of eurozone reform are inseparably linked, fiscal expansion could prove to be as ineffective as efforts by monetary policymakers to foster growth.
事实上，一些欧洲穆斯林曾远赴阿富汗，巴基斯坦和伊拉克；另外一些曾东渡也门和索马里拜师学艺，学成归来后，他们成为坚定的激进分子和反抗西方的战士，在他们眼中，西方使伊斯兰蒙羞。	True, some young European Muslims have traveled to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq; some went as far as Yemen and Somalia, and came back as hardened radicals, soldiers in a war against a West that, in their view, dishonors Islam.
就连一向对深化与美国安全关系持谨慎态度的印度现在也已接受地区双边防御的理念 — — 结盟对象不仅包括美国，也包括东亚国家和日本。	Even India, which has been cautious about deepening its security ties with the US, has now embraced the idea of regional mutual defense – not only with America, but also with Japan and other East Asian countries.
结果，当货币市场基金可能无法充分偿付投资者的可能性升高时 — — 如2008年9月雷曼兄弟倒闭后 — — 地狱之门就打开了。	As a result, when the possibility arises that a money-market fund will be unable to pay investors in full – as happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 – all hell breaks loose.
但是候选人还有前财长阿列克谢•库德林，如果俄罗斯需要一位对经济改革满怀热情、鞠躬尽瘁的人，他倒可以接替梅德韦杰夫。	But waiting in the wings is former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, who could replace Medvedev should Russia need a factotum of sincerity about economic reform.
桑德卜指出，这不但能将公共金融和银行的不当行为隔离；还能形成一个均衡，净债务国和净债权国之间达到类似于财政风险共担的格局。	Sandbu argues that this would not only insulate public finance from the follies of banks; it would also lead to an equilibrium that mimics fiscal risk-sharing between countries that are net borrowers and countries that are net lenders.
坎布里奇—下个月，美国财政部将按期向国会递交指明哪些国家（如有）通过操纵货币赢得不公平贸易优势的半年报告。	CAMBRIDGE – Next month, the US Department of the Treasury is due to submit to Congress its biannual report detailing which countries, if any, are manipulating their currencies to gain an unfair trade advantage.
当选后，马克龙保持了其新鲜空气的名声，组建了一个由来自社会各界的年轻人组成的政府 — — 他们也许欠缺经验，但充满了热情和智慧。	After his election, Macron upheld his reputation as a breath of fresh air, building a government composed of young people from all walks of life – inexperienced, maybe, but enthusiastic and smart.
但他的任期将在2011年10届满，而且无法连任，欧洲各国领导人也不可能等到最后一刻才确定他的继任者。	But his non-renewable term will end in October 2011, and European leaders are not waiting until the last moment to appoint his successor.
它旗下的站点 — — 其中六个由比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会出资，前三年提供730万美元初始资金 — — 刚刚建立。	The sites – six of which are being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through an initial $73 million grant for the first three years – are just being established.
草率设计的削减开支计划削弱了经济增长，使得政府的财政状况日益恶化，迫使其削减公共服务和基础设施项目，结果是国家能力受到了严重侵蚀。	Hastily designed spending cuts have undermined growth, and thus the government’s fiscal position, forcing it to kill off public services and infrastructure projects. The result has been a severe erosion of state capacity.
纽约 — — 欧盟是在卡尔·波普尔所谓的“零碎社会工程 ” （ piecemeal social engineering）的思想下产生的。	NEW YORK – The European Union was brought into existence by what Karl Popper called piecemeal social engineering.
此外，政府需要对无家可归人口进行更准确的评估，毕竟带着孩子逃离家庭虐待的母亲与患有创伤后应激障碍的退伍老兵有着不同的需求。	Moreover, governments will need a more accurate assessment of the homeless population. A mother fleeing domestic abuse with her children has different needs than a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder.
在这样的背景下，世界卫生组织新任总干事泰德罗斯·杰贝耶斯拥有独一无二的机会进行人们所迫切需要的改革。	Against this backdrop, the World Health Organization (WHO), under its new Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, has a unique opportunity to pursue urgently needed reforms.
如果是这样，保守党极右翼部分领导人可能认为可以无需为首相戴维·卡梅伦及其政策提供无条件的支持，因为反正工党也不可能在柯比的领导下胜出。	In this case, leaders of the Conservative Party’s far-right component are likely to think that they can dispense with offering disciplined support to Prime Minister David Cameron and his policies, because Labour can never win under Corbyn, anyway.
最紧迫的是，海地需要为其22亿美元规模、为期十年的消灭霍乱全国计划（National Cholera Elimination Plan）寻找融资帮助。	Most urgent, Haiti needs help funding its $2.2 billion ten-year National Cholera Elimination Plan.
如今，极端贫困主要集中在非洲；据世界银行2018年《贫困与共同繁荣 》 （ Poverty and Shared Prosperity）报告，全世界最穷的28个国家有27个在非洲，其中每个国家的贫困率都高于30 % 。	Today, extreme poverty is mostly contained to Africa; according to the World Bank’s 2018 Poverty and Shared Prosperity report, 27 of the world’s 28 poorest countries are on the continent, and each has a poverty rate above 30%.
从将自己定义为反殖民主义者和反种族主义者—多元文化主义的领军派—他们转变成为针对穆斯林正统派的所谓启蒙价值观的竭力捍卫者。	From defining themselves as anti-colonialists and anti-racists – champions of multiculturalism amp#45;amp#45; they have become fervent defenders of so-called Enlightenment values against Muslim orthodoxy.
威廉·杰宁斯·布莱恩（William Jennings Bryan）在1986年总统选战中向他的核心选区承诺放松货币时也是如此：他的票仓是饱受高利率和大宗商品价格下跌冲击的中西部农民。	It was also the argument William Jennings Bryan made during his 1896 presidential campaign, when he promised easier money to his core constituency: Midwestern farmers who had been hit hard by high interest rates and declining commodity prices.
谈判这些协议常常会让项目延长四年 — — 以达成所谓的财务结算（financial closing ） — —然后才开始实质运作。	Negotiating such agreements often adds four years to the project – to get to the so-called financial closing – before any physical work is done.
新德里—法国哲学家、作家伏尔泰揶揄道，在运转了近一千后，衰颓的神圣罗马帝国既不神圣，也不罗马，更不是帝国。	NEW DELHI – After a run of nearly one thousand years, quipped the French philosopher and writer Voltaire, the fading Holy Roman Empire was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire.
但2000年9月，在第55界联合国大会上，189个国家的领导人启动了千年发展计划，这些截止期也就无疾而终了。	Yet those deadlines had come and gone when, in September 2000, during the 55th UN General Assembly, leaders of 189 nations adopted the MDGs.
此外，尽管当时欧元区失业率正在下降，但仍接近10 % ， 1999年全年都高于今天的水平9.3 % 。	While unemployment in the eurozone was declining, the rate was close to 10%, and it remained higher than today’s level, 9.3%, for all of 1999.
至于剩下的95 % ， 如果能够在美国公民和其他人中均衡地分割，而非用于消费，那么，这将创造更大的幸福和机会。	The next 95% would create much more happiness and opportunity if it was divided evenly among US citizens or others than if they were to consume any portion of it.
It was, of course, nice that world leaders could agree that it would be bad to risk the devastation that could be wrought by an increase in global temperatures of more than two degrees Celsius.	It was, of course, nice that world leaders could agree that it would be bad to risk the devastation that could be wrought by an increase in global temperatures of more than two degrees Celsius.
但官僚主义、宣传和误导使得数百万非洲农民（包括肯尼亚农民）无法获得这一可以改善生活质量、有助于解决粮食短缺的技术。	But bureaucracy, propaganda, and misinformation are preventing millions of African farmers, including in Kenya, from accessing a technology that can improve livelihoods and help to redress food shortages.
虽然整个贸易系统无疑都是为西方列强的利益服务的，但没有了非洲统治精英的大力配合，这个系统是不可能存在的。	It was a system that no doubt worked to the benefit of Africa’s partners. But it would not have existed without the active and willing participation of African elites.
政府还声称我掌控了布鲁塞尔的欧洲机构，而且我正利用这样的控制对欧盟成员国强制推行邪恶的“索罗斯计划 ” 。	The government also claims that I control the European institutions in Brussels, and that I am using that control to impose the nefarious “Soros Plan” on EU member states.
在经济光谱的另一端，银行行为将 — — 正如人们所希望的那样 — — 得到更好的规管，这也是在一段长时期内令人震惊的金融失职之后才出现的。	At the other end of the economic spectrum, banking practices will – one hopes – be better regulated, following a prolonged period of stunning financial irresponsibility.
由于这个职位的任命并不需要国会的批准，总统可以指派任何他想要的人，而不会因他的选择被美国参议院痛骂。	Because this position does not require Congressional approval, the president may appoint whomever he wants, without having his choice raked over the coals in the US Senate.
其实，敏锐的朝鲜问题观察家指出金正恩希望在仍然拥有冷酷而经验丰富的金敬姬支持的情况下，通过下令发射导弹来巩固自己对权力的掌控。	Indeed, keen observers of North Korea suggest that Kim Jong-un ordered the missile launch as a way to strengthen his grip on power while he still has the experienced and ruthless Kim Kyong-hui’s backing.
大部分（甚至所有）欧元区国家和准欧元区国家的参与能增强欧元区的凝聚力，更容易获得其他领域合作的公众支持。	The involvement of most, or all, current and future eurozone countries would enhance the group’s coherence, making it easier to win public support for cooperation in other areas.
对C/C变体的携带者来说（大约占总人口的20 % ） ，精神病风险会提高七倍 — — 但只局限于每天使用大麻者。	For carriers of the C/C variant (which occurs in roughly 20% of the population), the risk of psychosis increased seven-fold – but only for the people who used cannabis every day.
此事涉及至关重要的最高法院提名，而且众议院议长保罗·瑞安有一份削减政府预算的开支准备让共和党总统签署。	A pivotal Supreme Court nomination is at stake, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has a government-slashing budget ready for a Republican president to sign.
联合国粮食及农业组织（粮农组织）理事会决定，粮农组织的目标将不再仅仅是减少饥饿，而是消除饥饿、粮食不安全和营养不良。	The Council of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization decided that the FAO’s goal should no longer be merely to reduce hunger, but to eradicate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.
在年景好的时候设立“纾困基金”以备衰退的同时，各州的“一般责任（general obligation ） ” 借贷仅限于修建公路或者学校项目。	While “rainy day” funds that accumulate in boom years are used to deal with temporary revenue shortfalls, the states’ “general obligation” borrowing is limited to capital projects like roads and schools.
2016年夏天，为选战阵营物色领军人物的特朗普让班农做他的团队执行主席。 班农是个不修边幅的泼皮无赖，此前是个商人，当时是布莱巴特新闻（Breitbart News，宣扬白人民族主义的网站）的首席执行官。	In the summer of 2016, with his campaign lacking a leader, Trump made Bannon – a scruffy, scrappy former businessman who was then the executive chair of Breitbart News, a website preaching white nationalism – the campaign’s chief executive.
作为旨在帮助弱势学生的FATIH 工程的一部分，2014年土耳其投入14亿里拉（6,650万美元）用于为学校配置互联网宽带和最新信息技术。	As part of the FATIH project to help underprivileged students, Turkey has allocated 1.4 billion lira ($665 million) in 2014 to equip its schools with broadband Internet and the latest information technology.
时隔四年，经济预测者在衰退深度以及持续时间上的持续失准又让人们不禁跟女王一样发问：为何会高估了经济复苏？	Four years later, the repeated failure of economic forecasters to predict the depth and duration of the slump would have elicited a similar question from the queen: Why the overestimate of recovery?
但她也向奥尔斯特新教徒（Ulster Protestants）做出让步，北爱尔兰和英国主岛之间不会有边境。	But she has also conceded to the Ulster Protestants that there will be no border between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.
正如一位资深外交官所说 ： “ 如果你想和另外20国商讨一个汇率协议，或者像克林顿政府早期那样与20个国家商讨援助墨西哥问题，那不是一件容易的事。	As one experienced diplomat put it, “if you’re trying to negotiate an exchange-rate deal with 20 countries or a bailout of Mexico, as in the early Clinton days, with 20 countries, that’s not easy.
伊朗希望直接与国际原子能机构解决问题，而不愿与五常谈判解决，后者对伊朗实施了旨在强迫其中止核浓缩计划的制裁。	The Iranians want to resolve their problems directly with the IAEA, and to avoid negotiating under the cloud of UN Security Council resolutions, which impose sanctions on Iran to force suspension of enrichment.
当韩国这样的东亚国家通过这类政策来让特定行业进行全球范围竞争时，拉丁美洲和加勒比国家却几乎没有走对过路子。	While East Asian countries like South Korea used such policies to enable selected industries to compete on a global scale, Latin American and Caribbean countries rarely got it right.
ECSC的目的明显是具有政治性的：消除重型武器生产中所需的两种重要原材料的控制权，该控制权来自曾在史上最为血腥残忍的战争中相互斗争的国家。	The aim of the ECSC was explicitly political: to remove control of the two most important raw materials for the production of heavy weaponry from states that had just fought the bloodiest war in history.
而这也是共和党为何正寻求攫取茶党运动的能量来实现其私利，并大洒金钱（特别是借助前众议院议员迪克·阿尔梅的筹款及宣传组织）来过度运作这些运动。	This is also why the Republicans are seeking to capture the Tea Party movement’s energy for partisan purposes, overrunning it with well-paid operatives, particularly from former Representative Dick Armey’s fundraising and advocacy organization.
他总是指责别人撒谎，但他的经济主张和承诺 — — 事实上，是他的一整套治国理念 — — 可以与纳粹德国的“大谎言”宣传家相媲美。	While he routinely accuses others of lying, many of his economic assertions and promises – indeed, his entire view of governance – seem worthy of Nazi Germany’s “big lie” propagandists.
事实上，中国工商银行的地方财政平台单款不良率只有0.3 % ， 而相应的保付率 — — 即银行吸收不良贷款损失的能力 — — 为1066 % 。	Indeed, the ICBC’s non-performing loan (NPL) ratio for LFP loans is as low as 0.3%, while the corresponding coverage ratio – the bank’s ability to absorb losses from NPLs – is 1,066%.
比如，大型国有企业占了中国股市市值的三分之二，但它们只贡献了中国GDP的三分之一弱，对就业的贡献就更小了。	Majority state-owned firms account for two-thirds of the market value of the country’s exchanges, for example, though they are responsible for no more than one-third of Chinese GDP and an even smaller share of employment.
贱民和印度的原住民（宪法中所列的“贱民和部落 ” ） 在印度的543人组成的议会中有权获得85个席位，这是为他们的社区“保留”的席位。	Dalits and India’s aboriginals (listed in the Constitution as “Scheduled Castes and Tribes”) are entitled to 85 seats in India’s 543-member parliament that are “reserved” for candidates from their communities.
它的经济分析对于不太富裕的国家价值更高，在这些国家，防止传染病暴发可以对长期经济增长起到直接提振作用。	And its analyses would be even more valuable to less wealthy countries, where preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases could directly boost long-term economic growth.
虽然我一向对预测界人士以及金融市场的集体智慧敬重有加，但我怀疑当前的自满共识将在2018年遭受严峻考验。	While I have great respect for the forecasting community and the collective wisdom of financial markets, I suspect that today’s consensus of complacency will be seriously tested in 2018.
伦敦—12月底，骚乱开始在伊朗各大城镇迅速蔓延，这几乎让所有人都震惊不已，包括总统鲁哈尼的改革派政府、许多伊朗公民以及观察家。	LONDON – The rapid spread of civil unrest in Iranian towns and cities that began in late December has taken nearly everyone – President Hassan Rouhani’s reform-minded government, many citizens, and observers – by surprise.
但这将扼杀外部需求，破坏更广泛的经济管理，也让中国对全球经济领导地位的主张（包括人民币国际化）信誉扫地。	But that would stifle external demand, undermine economic management more broadly, and discredit the country’s claim to global economic leadership (including internationalization of the renminbi).
在木塔希的例子中，在模仿中用自己的家人是一个策略，意在证明小家的独裁与政治暴君式的极权总统没有什么区别。	In Mutahi’s case, the use of his own family in his parodies was a device intended to demonstrate that petty domestic despotism was no different from the political tyranny orchestrated by an autocratic president.
12月初，他来到拉合尔，十天后，他在该市独立纪念塔广场的大型公众集会上发表了演讲。 一年前，板球运动员出身的政客的伊姆兰·汗（Imran Khan）在这里掀起了一场他称之为（尽管有些用词不当）政治海啸的风波。	Ten days later, he addressed a mammoth public meeting at the city’s Minar-e-Pakistan grounds, where, a year earlier, the cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan had launched what he not very appropriately termed a political tsunami.
在土耳其外长阿卜杜拉·居尔今年一月的早些时候出访以色列时，双方就土耳其担任巴以之间及未来叙以会谈的斡旋者的问题进行了严肃的讨论。	During a visit of Turkey’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to Israel in early January, there was serious discussion about Turkey assuming a mediating role between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as in future Syrian-Israeli talks.
阿基诺三世打击腐败、重建国家经济基础的努力让菲律宾在多年后终于成为东南亚增长最快的经济体，去年GDP增长率达到了7.2 % 。	Aquino’s efforts to fight corruption and rebuild his country’s economic foundations has enabled the Philippines – at long last – to become Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing economy, with annual GDP growth of 7.2% last year.
尽管自20世纪30年代以来，对数百万人的系统性监测和治疗极大地减少了该病的传播，但20世纪五六十年代稍稍放松紧惕便又使昏睡病死灰复燃，在20世纪90年代初到达流行病水平。	Though the systematic screening and treatment of millions of people dramatically reduced disease transmission in the 1930’s, the relaxation of such efforts allowed HAT to reemerge in the 1950’s and 1960’s, reaching epidemic levels by early 1990’s.
虽然高公共支出的斯堪的纳维亚半岛国家都表现不错，但许多对欧洲的批评（尤其是来自于美国）都将欧元危机归咎于政府规模的过度膨胀。	Many critics of Europe, particularly in the US, link the euro crisis to the outsize role of government there, though the Scandinavian countries are doing well, despite high public spending.
因此，总时薪正在快速增长，2015年一季度增长年率为3.1 % ， 而2014年全年为2.5 % ， 2013年为1.1 % 。	As a result, total compensation per hour is rising more rapidly, with the annual rate increasing to 3.1% in the first quarter of 2015, from 2.5% in 2014 as a whole and 1.1% in 2013.
美国股市40 ％的下挫幅度以及房价的大幅下降已经使美国家庭的财富蒸发了十万多亿美元，这很可能导致每年减少4000多亿美元的消费额。	The 40% decline in the US stock market and the dramatic fall in house prices have reduced American households’ wealth by more than $10 trillion, which is likely to reduce annual consumer spending by more than $400 billion.
英格兰银行首席经济学家安迪·哈尔丹（Andy Haldane）勇敢地提出所有货币都应该数字化，这将让实时负利率降临到每一个人头上，从而迫使所有人都立即花钱。	Andy Haldane, Chief Economist at the Bank of England, has courageously suggested that all money should become digital, which would permit real-time negative interest rates to be imposed on all of us, thus forcing everyone to spend at once.
似乎没有东西曾经让他比4月9日联邦调查局反常搜擦迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen，他的个人法务主管和残局收拾人）的办公室、住所和饭店房间更加愤怒。	It seems that nothing has made him angrier than the FBI’s extraordinary April 9 raid on the office, home, and hotel room of Michael Cohen, his principal personal attorney and fixer.
巴塞罗那—最近几个月来，二分法渐成气候 — — 一边是繁荣的金融市场，另一边是停滞的经济和陷入瘫痪的政治。	BARCELONA – In recent months, the dichotomy between booming financial markets, on the one hand, and sluggish economies and dysfunctional politics, on the other, has loomed large.
到2010年，北京、上海和天津的外来人口翻了一番以上，分别达到了34.5 % 、 37.9%和21 % 。	By 2010, the migrant population in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin had more than doubled, to 34.5%, 37.9%, and 21%, respectively.
意大利人口不及美国的五分之一，但议员数量却达到美国的两倍，而且议员所拥有的薪酬和特权在世界各国均处于领先地位。	With less than one-fifth of the population of the United States, Italy’s parliament has twice as many members as the US Congress, and they are among the world’s best-compensated and most privileged MPs.
印度可能、也可能不会是下一个世界经济奇迹，但如果印度要想成为大多数市民的良好居住地，它必须解决它长年积存的问题，以及它的新问题。	India may or may not be the world's next economic wonder; but it will have to solve its age-old problems, as well as its new ones, if it is going to be a good place to live for the vast majority of its citizens.
这还不算完：州和地方预算削减已经拖累了美国人力资本和基础设施投资速度，这将使美国长期增长趋势再缩水1个百分点。	There is more: state and local budget-cutting has slowed America’s pace of investment in human capital and infrastructure, adding a third percentage point to the downward shift in the country’s long-term growth trajectory.
尽管某些紧张局势看似完全是双边的，但是格鲁吉亚和俄国冲突表明，在这一全球化的世界里以及这一相互关联的地区不会有什么双边紧张局势了。	Although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral, the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world, and certainly not in this interconnected region.
比如，老布什总统从来不做“远在天边的事 ” ， 但其踏实的管理和执行打造了美国过去50年中最成功的外交日程。	Consider President George H.W. Bush, who did not do “the vision thing,” but whose sound management and execution underpinned one of the most successful US foreign-policy agendas of the past half-century.
一句话说，阻止中央银行扮演最后借款者的角色将导致原本有能力偿付债务的经济体陷入一场不必要的债务危机，破坏生产及就业。	In other words, prohibiting the central bank from acting as lender of last resort can push solvent economies into a needless debt crisis, undermining output and employment.
在所有系统性的危机中，对大部分人实行紧缩，对银行家实行社会主义，对地方民主实行扼杀，这样的组合必然会造成绝望和不满，成为民族主义的温床。	In any systemic crisis, the combination of austerity for the many, socialism for bankers, and strangulation of local democracy creates the hopelessness and discontent that are nationalism’s oxygen.
一旦这些公司主宰了一个市场，它们就会转向下一个同样没有竞争、全无出口机会的市场，通常利用其规模和政治影响排挤潜在竞争对手。	Once these companies dominate one market, they move to another that is equally sheltered from competition and devoid of export opportunities, often using their size and political influence to keep out would-be competitors.
随着英国银行部门竞争力因此下降，恢复当初导致危���的轻触式（light-touch）监管的诱惑可能增加。	As the UK banking sector’s competitiveness suffers, the temptation to return to the kind of light-touch regulation that enabled the crisis in the first place could intensify.
但大部分工人并未参与到这些计划中，而最大的受益者则是CEO和高层管理者，他们的收入大头与生产率挂钩，反映在利润和股票表现中。	But most workers are not covered by such plans, and the biggest beneficiaries have been CEOs and top managers, a significant fraction of whose pay is tied to productivity, as reflected in profits and stock performance.
新德里—中国外交部长王毅即将访问印度，并与印度新政府成员做首次会面，包括外交部长斯瓦拉吉（Sushma Swaraj）和更重要的总理莫迪。	NEW DELHI – Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s upcoming visit to India will include his first meetings with India’s new government, including Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and, more important, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
而倘若把慷慨的公共教育，医疗，和退休收益都计入这些国家的家庭可支配收入计算中的话，那美国中产阶级的相对位置只会滑向得更远 。 。	Once the generous public benefits in education, health care, and retirement are added to estimates of disposable family income in these countries, the relative position of the US middle class slips even further.
在马里、尼日尔、卢旺达和马拉维等村庄因高额的运输成本而与市场脱节的内陆国家，以及缺少河流、靠雨水灌溉的地区，问题尤其严重。	The problem is especially severe in landlocked countries like Mali, Niger, Rwanda, and Malawi, where high transport costs leave villages isolated from markets, and in regions that depend on rainfall rather than river-based irrigation.
在巴西和印度等国，人们的日常生活环境核辐射量是英国的20—200倍，但显然这并没有造成负面的遗传影响。	In countries like Brazil and India, people live in environments that have 20-200 times the radiation commonly found in the UK, apparently with no negative genetic effects.
在果断行动的支持下，消除饥饿和营养不良的长期政治承诺已成为改善健康状况、支持全球经济持续、包容增长的关键所在。	A long-term political commitment to eradicating hunger and undernourishment – backed by decisive action – holds the key to improving health outcomes and supporting sustainable, inclusive economic growth worldwide.
在经济方面，他必须让充分就业的德国的当务之急与仍在衰退和大量失业中苦苦挣扎的希腊和意大利的当务之急协调起来。	On the economy, he must reconcile the priorities of full-employment Germany with those of Greece and Italy, which remain in the grip of recession and sky-high unemployment.
相互依存关系铸就伙伴之间健康的互动，双方自己满足自己的需要而不依赖他人，并且在维持自身身份的同时维护双边关系的共同利益。	An interdependent relationship fosters healthy interaction between partners, who satisfy their own needs rather than relying on others to do so, and maintain their own identities while appreciating the relationship’s mutual benefits.
如果中国政府果真使用这一方法刺激购买保险，应该将税收优惠限于对昂贵医疗情况（如手术或糖尿病治疗）的保险上。	If the Chinese government does use this approach to stimulate the purchase of insurance, it should limit the favorable tax treatment to insurance for expensive medical conditions like surgery or the treatment of diabetes.
华盛顿 — — 2月，埃及革命推翻了独裁者，但埃及是否能够成为一个正常运转的稳定民主国家还远未尘埃落定。	WASHINGTON, DC – Egypt’s revolution toppled a dictator in February, but the country’s future as a stable, functioning democracy remains uncertain.
它们还使工业时代的著名公司 — — 其本质是实现专业化和节约交易成本的关键机构 — — 变得无关紧要。	They are also making the celebrated firm of the industrial age – an essential institution, which allowed for specialization and saved on transactions costs – redundant.
如今，首相安倍晋三的货币扩张方针 — — 其经济复苏计划“安倍经济学”的核心 — — 正在产生积极结果，特别是在劳动力市场。	Today, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s approach to monetary expansion – central to his “Abenomics” program for economic recovery – is producing positive results, especially in the labor market.
迄今为止，中国对所有新情况的反应是毫不妥协，坚持与在军事上远逊于自己的东盟成员国在双边基础上解决领土争端。	So far, China’s reaction to all of this new activity has been to dig in its heels and insist on addressing its territorial disputes with ASEAN’s militarily inferior members on a bilateral basis.
欧洲央行对通货膨胀的偏向很有可能会被放弃，因为金融危机和美国经济疲软的影响会让欧洲经济急剧下降，对于这一点甚至连一贯持乐观态度的欧洲央行也无法否认。	The ECB’s inflationary bias will most likely be dropped, as the effect of the financial crisis and the US slowdown sends Europe’s economy into a spin that even the ever-optimistic ECB will be unable to deny.
事实上，尽管40—55%的低收入工人（每年收入25,000美元或以下）会参与一些独立工作，但他们只构成所有独立赚钱者的25%弱。	Indeed, although 40-55% of low-income workers (earning $25,000 or less per year) engage in some independent work, they comprise less than 25% percent of all independent earners.
市场失灵以及需求得不到满足的诉求本不足以构成政府干预私人经济的充分条件，因为药方可能比疾病更加糟糕。	Market failures or claims of unmet need are not sufficient to prescribe government intervention in the private economy, because the cure may be worse than the disease.
相反，世贸组织贸易协定可以建立多边和地区开发银行的有效联系，从而有助于实现马拉喀什协定所提出的加强国际合作的原则。	Rather, WTO trade agreements could establish effective links with multilateral and regional development banks, thereby helping to realize the principle of closer international coordination set out in the Marrakesh Agreement.
这就意味着抵制难以计数的从产业游说团体到工会乃至地位稳固的官僚组织等利益集团。 目前为止，它们成功地保护了它们的既得利益。	That means facing down the myriad interest groups – from industry lobbies to trade unions and entrenched bureaucracies – that have (so far) successfully protected their turfs.
因此，如果全部减记成本都由银行承担，大多数银行充其量也就是损失了不到一年的利润 — — 这样利润此前可是维持了好几年呢。	So, if the entire write-down cost were covered by banks, most of them would lose the equivalent of no more than one year’s profits – spread over several years.
这个错误既不在他们2009年的获奖著作中，也不再后来被广泛传阅的、回应对他们工作的学术争论的论文中。	The error is in neither their prize-winning 2009 book nor in a subsequent widely read paper responding to the academic debate about their work.
纽约—方言全球，德国和欧洲的朋友们都为德国基督教民主党和社会民主党（SPD）重新拿出讨论恢复执政大联盟的意愿而大舒一口气。	NEW YORK – Friends of Germany and Europe around the world have been breathing a sigh of relief at the newfound willingness of Germany’s Christian Democrats and Social Democrats (SPD) to discuss reprising their grand coalition government.
意大利财政部长帕多安（Pier Carlo Padoan）正确地指出应该采取欧元区“记分牌 ” ， 直接比较各国的改革。	Italy’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, is rightly pushing for a eurozone “reform scorecard,” which would enable direct comparison among national reforms.
其次，非洲正在经历一次以快速数字化、城市化和劳动年龄人口增长为特色的深刻的长期转型，非洲劳动人口截止2034年将在数量上超过中国和印度。	Second, Africa is undergoing a profound long-term transformation, characterized by rapid digitization, urbanization, and growth in the working-age population, which will outnumber the labor force of China and India by 2034.
但这类行动对于武装分子来说同样也是不利的，因为这完全昭示出威胁巴基斯坦的最大元凶究竟是何人，至此在巴国境内也再也没有什么大规模的，反对巴军南瓦齐里斯坦军事行动的街头抗议了。	But this inside knowledge also worked against the militants, because it demonstrated what was at stake for the country at large. No large street protests against the military operation in South Waziristan have been reported from anywhere in Pakistan.
还有其他一些中东欧的国家，比如匈牙利、乌克兰和波罗的海国家也处于极大的危险中，它们拥有庞大的经常项目赤字并且公司和家庭都背负着巨额的外汇债务。	Several other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Hungary, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, were also living dangerously, with large current-account deficits and firms and households running up huge debts in foreign currency.
但个别国家将倾向于采取干预和各种经济政策捍卫均衡汇率，甚至会有更极端的情况，形成国际当局允许贸易伙伴采取激进的干预措施以增强稳定性。	But individual countries would orient intervention and economic policies toward defending the equilibrium rate, or, more radically, an international authority might authorize aggressive intervention by trading partners to promote consistency.
与此同时，他们应该解决欧洲长期竞争力的诸项重大威胁，包括生产率低下、内部市场不完善以及创新不充分等。	At the same time, they should tackle other major threats to Europe’s long-term competitiveness, including low productivity, an incomplete internal market, and insufficient innovation.
纵使许多人失去了工作，家庭和希望，却有数万亿美元存款在各个全球金融中心之间流转，除此之外还有数万亿美元被绝望的央行抽出来紧急置换金融家造成的烂账。	While many lost jobs, homes, and hopes, trillions of dollars in savings have been sloshing around the world’s financial centers ever since, on top of more trillions pumped out by desperate central banks eager to replace the financiers’ toxic money.
纽约时报最近就报道了一起厄瓜多尔人头走私犯运送他们的人头货船到危地马拉海岸，然后通过墨西哥进入美国的事例。	The New York Times recently published an exceptional description of Ecuadorian polleros transporting their human cargo to the coasts of Guatemala and then onward through Mexico to the US.
生态学家和农学家告诉我们如何在更少的土地上种植更多更好的作物，同时结束森林砍伐并让已经退化的土地得到恢复。	Ecologists and agronomists show us how to grow more and better crops on less land while ending deforestation and restoring previously degraded land.
2006年，在付出了5000万宗本可预防的疟疾死亡的代价之后，联合国所属世界卫生组织逆转禁令，批准将DDT用于杀灭和驱赶疟蚊。	In 2006, after roughly 50 million preventable deaths, the United Nations’ World Health Organization reversed course and endorsed the use of DDT to kill and repel Anopheles mosquitoes.
这些计算表明，即便打上很高的折扣 ， 《 斯特恩报告》对于未来利益和代价的预计数字显示减排在经济上是有益的。	These calculations indicate that, even with higher discounting, the Stern Review’s estimates of future benefits and costs imply that mitigation makes economic sense.
极低利率通过两��方式推高资产价格：它们增加股票或固定收入债券的未来收入流的现值；它们让获得信用和购买房产变得更加容易负担。	Ultra-low interest rates lift asset prices in two ways: they increase the present value of the future income stream of a stock or a fixed-income bond; and they make credit and property purchases more affordable.
国际移民组织委员会（International Organization for Migration Council）也在11月通过了类似的决议，该动议还获得了公民社会团体和国际组织的更多支持。	The International Organization for Migration Council issued a similar resolution in November, and the campaign has attracted additional support from civil-society groups and international organizations.
再进一步假定相对宽松的20%的行政人头支出，这一项目的总体成本大约是六亿美元，相当于2004年记录给予这些国家援助的五分之一及其GDP总和的3.5%到4 % 。	Further assuming a relatively generous 20% administration overhead, the total cost of the scheme would be approximately $600 million – equivalent to a fifth of the reported aid flow to these countries in 2004 and to 3.5-4% of their combined GDP.
埃塞俄比亚曾是饥饿和干旱的代名词，但现如今它已成为非洲最大经济体之一 — — 而且是在不靠黄金和石油的情况下取得的。	Once a basket-case associated in the world’s eyes only with famine and drought, Ethiopia has become one of Africa’s largest economies – and without the benefit of gold or oil.
欧盟至今仍无法一致通过银行联盟设计方案，甚至还放任其成员国之一匈牙利总理欧尔班（Viktor Orbán）诋毁作为欧盟基石的民主和自由的价值。	While it still cannot fully agree on the design of its banking union, it is allowing Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary, a member country, to denigrate the democratic and liberal values upon which the EU rests.
金融救助即便是那些不值得救助的人，但如果大家都可以受益的话，还是可以接受的 — — 尽管那些金融冒险家是最大的受益者。	And that, unfortunately, is the perception held by many nowadays, particularly in the United States.
MBS赢得了一场包括数百位王子在内的权力斗争，其中大部分都比他年长和富有经验，并且他们都认为自己有权统治沙特阿拉伯。	MBS has won a race to the throne that included hundreds of princes, most of whom are older and more experienced – and all of whom feel entitled to rule.
自从中国在2005年7月实施汇率调控机制改革以来，人民币兑美国升值了32 % ， 并在去除通胀因素后对一揽子货币升值了约30 % 。	Since China reformed its exchange-rate regime in July 2005, the renminbi has risen 32% relative to the dollar and about 30% in inflation-adjusted terms against a broad basket of currencies.
相反，这个国家目前正面临一个重大挑战，国内力量 — — 特别是潜在的加泰罗尼亚自治区政府中的分离主义者 — — 想要分裂国家。	On the contrary, the country is now confronted with a major challenge, as domestic forces – in particular, the would-be separatists of Catalonia’s autonomous regional government – attempt to dismember the country.
至少从表面上看，法律与正义党由年轻的政治家领导，包括总统安德烈·杜达和接替Szydlo（同样也是波兰政界相对较新的面孔）的总理莫拉维茨基。	PiS is led, at least superficially, by younger politicians, including President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who succeeded Beata Szydło (also a relatively new face in Polish politics).
诺斯的工作有助于解释中国过去三十年来所发生的剧烈的制度变迁和经济成就，并对中国在未来十年将遇到的改革挑战有重要的启发。	North’s work goes a long way toward explaining the dramatic institutional and economic changes that have occurred in China over the last three decades, as well as illuminating the challenges that it will face over the next decade.
英国和法国在大力宣传间接军事干预：向叛军供应武器。 在它们看来，这是低成本、低风险、高潜在回报的选择。	The United Kingdom and France are pressing hard for indirect military intervention: supplying arms to the rebel side, in their view, would be a low-cost, low-risk, potentially high-return option.
但在人权保护的某个领域，备受诽谤的塞尔维亚采取了超越所有中东欧邻国的前所未有的举措，被塞尔维亚超越的国家有些已经成了欧盟的成员。	But in one area of human rights protection, much-maligned Serbia has taken an unprecedented step that puts ahead of all the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, including states that are already members of the European Union.
如果没有更多关于在政府提供服务方面如何创新的想法，那么当前人们看到在美国的斗争只会变得更糟糕，因为选民们逐渐被要求为更少的服务支付更多的钱。	Without more ideas about how to innovate in the provision of government services, battles such as one sees playing out in the US today can only become worse, as voters are increasingly asked to pay more for less.
随着建筑公司和其他政府合同的受益者开始向执政的自民党大笔捐款，这项政策催生了新的既得利益团体，也因此改变了政治环境。	This policy created new vested interests, and thus a new political environment, as construction companies and other beneficiaries of government contracts began donating heavily to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
两个因素能够保持其作为美国和欧盟重要盟友的地位：改善与库尔德人的关���以及塞浦路斯和解问题上的进展。	Two factors will sustain its position as an essential ally of the US and the EU: improved relations with the Kurds and progress toward a settlement in Cyprus.
但考虑到世界经济当前面临的结构问题以及生产消费之间的巨大缺口，一个全球增长协议如今显得更加必不可少。	But a global growth pact looks even more indispensable today, given the world economy’s structural problems and huge imbalances between production and consumption.
因此他不但鼓励伊斯兰教的衣着方式，还建造了一间宏伟的清真寺 — — 其规模即使不算欧洲最大，也是其中之一。	So he encouraged an Islamic dress code and built a huge mosque – one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in Europe.
但就算人们无法从今天占主导地位的民粹主义言论中意识到，回到以孤立民族国家为特点的全球秩序已经不可能了。	But there is no going back to a global order defined by isolated nation-states – even if one would not know it from the populist rhetoric dominating today's discussions.
它们的猜忌 — — 体现于赛克斯-皮科协定（Sykes-Picot Agreement）中 — — 造成了持续不断的破坏性外部干预。	Their cynicism – reflected, for example, in the Sykes-Picot Agreement – established a lasting pattern of destructive outside meddling.
本周，美国总统奥巴马和安倍晋三应重振美日双边同盟的活力，重申美日同盟原则并前所未有地强化军事和战略合作。	This week, US President Barack Obama and Abe should reinvigorate the bilateral alliance, reaffirming the principles on which it is based and committing to ever-closer military and strategic collaboration.
我们还有另一个项目 — — 目前已经有15个国家参与其中 — — 通过互动技术将各国高校学生��联起来，让他们可以共同讨论自己的信仰以及这些信仰对自身的意义。	We have another program – in 15 countries, with others set to join – that links high school students across the world through interactive technology to discuss their faith and what it means to them.
当然，日本本次遭遇的9.0级大地震是一个极为例外的事件 — — 这个事件发生的概率是如此之小，以至于无法用基于有限历史资料的模型来进行全面评估。	The 9.0-magnitude earthquake that struck Japan is, of course, a highly exceptional event – an event so rare that its probability cannot be well assessed with models based on limited historic data.
现在的问题是：英国 — — 在对政府的信心并未崩溃的情况下选择了紧缩 — — 会在应对危机排行榜上沦为末流、成为警告世人的反面教材吗？	Now the question is: will Britain – where confidence in the government has not cracked and where austerity is not forced but chosen – join the others at the bottom and serve as a horrible warning?
但奥巴马的胜利来之不易：他自己所在的民主党议员一边倒地反对快速通道授权，这意味着国会只能肯定或否定贸易协定，排除了修订的可能。	But Obama’s victory was not an easy one: Members of his own Democratic Party overwhelmingly opposed fast-track authority, which limits Congress to a single up-or-down vote on finished trade agreements, thereby ruling out amendments.
凭借着上述优势，土耳其不但为其所在区域的和平稳定贡献良多，还在构建一个公正，平等和透明的全球秩序方面不遗余力。	By making use of all of its assets, Turkey is contributing to regional stability and peace and working towards a global order based on justice, equality, and transparency.
但《太阳颂》所歌颂的“太阳兄 ” （ Brother Sun）和“月亮妹 ” （ Sister Moon）似乎过于接近自然崇拜，以至于有人质疑这是否可以包含在主流天主教思想中。	Yet the Canticle’s praise for “Brother Sun” and “Sister Moon”has seemed so close to nature-worship that some have doubted whether it could ever be included in mainstream Catholic thinking.
在这样的背景下，安倍在“温泉峰会”解决领土争议的希望破灭，而俄罗斯带着68份新商业协议回国，这一结果一点都不令人惊讶。	Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that Abe left the recent “onsen summit” with dashed hopes of resolving the territorial dispute, while Putin returned home with 68 new commercial accords.
但是，我在我的新书《唯一的游戏：中央银行、不稳定性和避免下一次崩溃 》 （ The Only Game in Town: Central Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next Collapse）中指出，日益激烈的内部紧张和矛盾，以及对货币政策的过度依赖，正在破坏这一均衡。	Yet, as I explain in my new book The Only Game in Town: Central Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next Collapse, growing internal tensions and contradictions, together with over-reliance on monetary policy, are destabilizing that equilibrium.
阿姆斯特丹—最新的经济数据表明，大多数发达经济体正在重新陷入衰退，金融市场正在承受自2008年雷曼兄弟倒闭以来最大的压力。	AMSTERDAM – The latest economic data suggests that recession is returning to most advanced economies, with financial markets now reaching levels of stress unseen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
这些大鼠接受全面训练以及各种刺激，学会如何与人类互动，并被教授如何在痰液（即下呼吸道咳出的黏液）样本中发现结核病毒。	The rats undergo a thorough training process, in which they are introduced to various stimuli, shown how to interact with people, and taught to detect TB in samples of sputum (mucus that is coughed up from the lower airways).
目前失业率高达8.5 % ， 劳动市场参与率只有64 % ， 真实工资一直停滞不前，这导致劳动收入占国民收入的比重只有44 % ， 为历史最低值。	With an unemployment rate of 8.5%, a labor-force participation rate of only 64%, and stagnant real wages, labor income has fallen to an historic low of 44% of national income.
最近的总统选战也不例外：共和党和民主党都将矛头对准了中国和跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） ， 说它们是美国工人遭遇困境的祸根。	The current presidential campaign is no exception: Republicans and Democrats alike have taken aim at both China and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, holding them up as the scourge of beleaguered American workers.
其中最大的风险是，人们对“国内”公司的传统认识和欧洲化日益扩大的现实可能会导致在制定政策时南辕北辙。	The biggest risk is that the growing disconnect between the perception of “national” companies and the reality of Europeanization may lead to spectacularly ill-judged policies.
但卢梭在另一个意义上仍然是正确的：政策不可能在缺乏政治的情况下发生，而养活未来城市的最大挑战依然在于那些财富过度集中所催生的问题。	But Rousseau is still right in another sense: policies cannot happen without politics, and the greatest challenge to feeding tomorrow’s cities lies in the problems that concentrated wealth creates.
通过研究不同大目标和小目标如何彼此关联起来，我们开发了一个独立研究框架帮助领导人在各自国家制定优先政策。	By studying how different goals and targets relate to one another, we developed an independent analytical framework to help leaders prioritize policies within their own countries.
国际足联前主席乔·阿维兰热常常梦想在以色列和巴勒斯坦之间举行一场足球比赛：美国副总统戈尔曾将这样的比赛视作帮助华盛顿解决巴以冲突的方法之一。	The former president of the FIFA, Joao Havelange, often dreamed of a football match between Israelis and Palestinians: the American vice-president Al Gore regarded such a match as a means to help Washington solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
所有亚洲人都应该认识到，不管共产主义中国什么时候认为它面临威胁，它都会付诸武力解决 — — 1950年的朝鲜、1962年的印度、1969年的苏联、1979年的越南都是如此。	As everyone in Asia should recognize, whenever communist China has deemed that it faced such a threat, it has resorted to war – in Korea in 1950, India in 1962, the Soviet Union in 1969, and Vietnam in 1979.
国际货币基金组织（IMR）预计，明年南非经济增长率很难达到1 % ， 而撒哈拉以南非洲其余国家将接近5 % 。	The International Monetary Fund expects output in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa to grow at a rate of close to 5% next year, but South Africa is projected to manage little more than 1% growth.
以某些市场工具指标来衡量的通胀预期在升息之后实际有所下降，表明市场对欧洲央行限制价格压力的信心增强。	Inflationary expectations, as measured by the rates on certain market instruments, actually fell after the hike, indicating increased confidence that the ECB will keep a lid on price pressures.
支持小企业通常有助于社会政策目标 — — 维持经济中最贫困和最难找到工作的群体的收入水平，而不能刺激产出和生产率增长。	Support for small enterprises often serves social-policy goals – sustaining the incomes of the economy’s poorest and most excluded workers – instead of stimulating output and productivity growth.
这将给发展中国家（其中不少面临困难的国内政策选择）助一臂之力，同时也让欧洲和日本面临的棘手挑战更易解决。	That will give developing countries (many of which face difficult domestic policy choices) a tailwind, while making the substantial challenges in Europe and Japan easier to address.
事实上，尽管决策者的注意力发生了变化，来自新兴经济体的竞争也日趋激烈，但欧洲国家的制造业表现仍位居世界前列，这是因为许多企业成功地实现了适应和创新。	In fact, despite policymakers’ shift in focus and emerging-economy competition, European countries remain among the world’s top performers in manufacturing, owing to the many firms that have managed to adapt and innovate.
在我们的书《火烧白宫 》 （ White House Burning）中，郭庾信（James Kwak）和我强调财政可持续性不仅对经济繁荣很重要，对国家安全也很重要。	In our book White House Burning, James Kwak and I emphasized that fiscal sustainability is important not just for economic prosperity but also for national security.
虽然根据会计准则，银行可以将资产按照帐面价格来统计。 实际上，很多有毒资产的实际价格已经远远不是帐面价格了。	Although accounting rules often permit banks to price these assets at face value, it is generally believed that the fundamental value of many toxic assets has fallen significantly below face value.
可以预计，在下个月的纽约，我们可以听到很多关于国际社会做更多的事帮助现有难民和解决迫使他们流离失所的问题的责任的说辞。	We can expect to hear a lot of talk in New York next month about the international community’s responsibility to do more to help existing refugees and address the conditions driving them to flee their homelands.
1979年，IMF经济学家波拉克（Jacques Polak，他是布雷顿森林会议荷兰代表团成员）就提出了一项这样做的计划。	In 1979, the IMF economist Jacques Polak, who had been part of the Dutch delegation at the Bretton Woods conference, outlined a plan for doing just that.
因此她为那些身患恶疾且无法医治的有行为能力的成年人打开了接受协助死亡的大门，其执行条件与其他协助死亡合法化的国家和地区并没有太大的区别。	She thus opened the door for physician assistance in dying for any grievously and irremediably ill competent adult, under conditions not very different from those that apply in other jurisdictions where physician assistance in dying is legal.
当今在预测上的一个根本问题就是经济减缓的最终成因其实是在心理学和社会学意义上的，并与不断波动的信心和变化中的“动物精神（animal spirits ） ” 相关联。	A fundamental problem in forecasting nowadays is that the ultimate causes of the slowdown are really psychological and sociological, and relate to fluctuating confidence and changing “animal spirits,” about which George Akerlof and I have written.
事实上，韩国的增长战略要起到成效，就必须为女性创造更好的经济机会，这可以通过建立更舒适的工作环境和建立更多样、更灵活的教育制度来部分实现。	Indeed, any effective South Korean growth strategy must create more and better economic opportunities for women, in part by establishing more accommodating working environments and instituting a more diverse and flexible education system.
正是因为出口多样化的紧迫需要，智利、秘鲁和其他中等收入国家才有可能从TPP这样的协议中获得巨大的好处。	Precisely because of the urgent need to diversify their exports, Chile, Peru, and other middle-income countries could benefit tremendously from agreements like the TPP.
就穆沙拉夫统治巴基斯坦的方式而言，人们很难想象他会宣布重返政坛。 如今，巴基斯坦是一个陷于困境的国家，无论是在政治层面上还是经济层面上。	Only a politician who has the support of major constituencies can hope to restore political order and economic health, and Musharraf is presenting himself as a candidate whom the military might support.
但拥有欧盟联合协议及国际货币基金组织可能提供的雄厚的资金和改革援助，俄罗斯措施的效力持续不了多长时间。	But, with an EU Association Agreement and the possibility of solid financial aid and reform assistance from the International Monetary Fund, the Russian measures would not have been sustainable.
克鲁格曼认为“债券纠察队”一词也许只对希腊等少数国家适用，但“信心仙子”纯属想象，和收集儿童的牙仙差不多。	Krugman thought the “bond vigilante” claim might be valid for a few countries, such as Greece, but argued that the “confidence fairy” was no less imaginary than the one that collects children’s teeth.
支持政府决定者指出，印度供给链浪费太大，只有大型国际零售连锁的财务实力和专业技能才能帮助印度供给链升级。	Those who support the decision argue that India’s supply chains are simply too wasteful, and that only the finance and knowhow of big, international retail chains can upgrade them.
今年一年，预计全美将新发恶性皮肤癌90，000例，超过8，000人会因此丧生；非恶性皮肤癌也将突破100万例，夺去另外2，000条无辜的生命。	An estimated 90,000 new cases of malignant melanoma and well over one million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer will occur in the United States this year. Melanoma will cause 8,000 deaths, and non-melanoma skin cancer will kill another 2,000.
别说如今在金融圈要找说雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安或他在2014年当选总统前领导的土耳其正义与发展党（AKP）好话的人很难。	Never mind that one would be hard pressed to find anyone in business or financial circles these days with a nice thing to say about Recep Tayyip Erdoğan or the AKP that he led before ascending to the presidency in 2014.
你也可能会想到哥伦比亚大学的亚历山德拉·卡塞拉（Alessandra Casella）所构想的 “ “ 可交易预算许可”机制。	Or one could think of a mechanism inspired by the “tradable deficits permits” imagined by Alessandra Casella of Columbia University.
对亚美尼亚、萨尔瓦多、海地、洪都拉斯、牙买加、吉尔吉斯斯坦、莱索托、摩尔多瓦、尼泊尔和塔吉克斯坦等国来说，侨民汇款相当于国民收入的六分之一强 — — 常常比出口规模还要大。	For countries such as Armenia, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Moldova, Nepal, and Tajikistan, expatriates remit the equivalent of more than one-sixth of national income – an amount that often exceeds exports.
如果这一点不马上发生改变，我们就有可能如同一战时期的英国首相劳埃德·乔治评论一战那样，再次“稀里糊涂地进入战争 。 ”	If this does not change soon, we may, as then-British Prime Minister David Lloyd George wrote of World War I, “[muddle] into war” yet again.
在移动设备在线零售领域，去年阿里巴巴占据了84.2%的市场份额，第二大在线零售商京东只获得了5.7%的市场。	In online retailing via mobile devices, Alibaba held an 84.2% share of the market last year, with the next largest online retailer, JD.com, capturing just 5.7%.
更严重的是，有人对他的民主承诺一直持怀疑态度，也有批评家批评他是一个老式的非洲“专制人物 ” ， 认为他会威吓对手并与其亲信一起侵占公共财产。	Most seriously, doubts persist about his commitment to democracy, with critics arguing he’s an old-style African “big man” ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies.
尤其重要的是，苏布拉曼尼恩制定出了用以一个衡量经济强权的指数，而这一指数应当被那些正在思考世界经济领导权变迁的人们视为议论的焦点。	In particular, Subramanian develops an index of economic dominance that should become a focus of conversation anywhere that people want to think about changes in world economic leadership.
最近有种理念 — — 以及统计数据 — — 正逐渐流行，其关注点就是我们在现代社会中日常接触到的毒素是如何影响自身免疫系统，也就是如何影响我们身体抵御癌细胞的能力的。	Yet there is some emerging thinking – and statistics – about how the toxins we encounter in the modern world affect our immune system, which in turn affects our bodies’ ability to combat cancerous cells.
伊朗还认为它可以让法国，也许还有德国，与美国一刀两断-好像这两个国家愿意为内贾德这样的领袖而激怒美国似的。	Iran has also believed that it could split France, and perhaps Germany, away from the United States – as if either country would risk infuriating the Americans for the sake of a leader like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
政府缺少财政空间，希腊银行背上了沉重的不良贷款负担，因此，动员希腊剩余资产、打通银行信用流向私人部门的健康部分的渠道十分重要。	With the government lacking fiscal room, and Greek banks burdened by non-performing loans, it is important to mobilize the state’s remaining assets and unclog the flow of bank credit to healthy parts of the private sector.
中美关系至关重要，这一点绝无可疑，而如果双方不能找到如何建设性地精诚合作，将会给世界造成极大的伤害，这一点同样绝无可疑。	It is hard to overstate how much rides on the Sino-US relationship, and how damaging it would be if the two sides could not find a way to work together constructively.
如此类推，这种限制只能服务于那些“人民公敌 ” — —少数群体和外国人（对于右翼民粹主义者来说）或金融精英（就左翼民粹主义者而言 ） 。	Such constraints can only serve the “enemies of the people” – minorities and foreigners (for right-wing populists) or financial elites (in the case of left-wing populists).
在美国，收入不平等从20世纪70年代末开始扩大，20世纪80年代末，这一趋势蔓延到欧洲，到本世纪初，甚至连具有长期平等主义传统的国家也染上了这一问题。	Income inequality began to widen in the US in the late 1970’s, and the trend spread to Europe by the late 1980’s, affecting even countries with long egalitarian traditions by the start of the new century.
除了强大的军队和安全机关，俄罗斯现在还有联邦国家卫队（Rosgvardiya ） ， 这是一支普京在2016年成立的直接听命于他的特遣队。	Beyond the amped-up military and the powerful security services, there is now the National Guard of the Russian Federation, or Rosgvardiya, a contingent of some 340,000 personnel created by Putin in 2016 that answers directly to him.
而后是布什发动的反复无常的反恐战争，之后又是巴拉克·奥巴马悍然无视国际法对利比亚、索马里和也门的军事干涉。	Then there was Bush’s capricious War on Terror, followed by Barack Obama’s military intervention in Libya, Somalia, and Yemen, in defiance of international law.
中国的投资狂热不禁让人想起了20世纪80年代的日本，当时是，高铁延伸到了日本的每个角落，偏远地区也没有落下。	China’s investment frenzy reminds many people of Japan in the 1980’s, when high-speed rail links were extended to Japan’s remotest corners.
人类学中有一个总体生育率（Total Fertility Rate）的概念，指每个女性在其一生中的平均生育数量。	What demographers call the Total Fertility Rate is the average number of live births per woman over her lifetime.
希腊的债务比率将从170%升至177 % （ 尽管在2012年获得了58个百分点的债务纾困 ） ， 葡萄牙的债务比率将从108%升高到127 % ， 法国将从86%升高到96 % 。	Greece’s debt ratio will rise from 170% to 177% (despite a 58-percentage-point debt-relief scheme in 2012), Portugal’s will surge from 108% to 127%, and France’s will rise from 86% to 96%.
平心而论，2007年以来，IMF在关于“双边监督”的决定中禁止“在外汇市场上进行大规模单方向干预 ” ， 该决定还规定“大规模、长时间”的经常项目失衡需要接受检查。	To be sure, since 2007, the IMF has prohibited “large-scale intervention in one direction in the exchange market,” in a decision on “bilateral surveillance” that also identifies “large and prolonged” current-account imbalances as a reason for review.
本杰明·富兰克林（Benjamin Franklin）曾对美国人民说，美国宪法将为他们构建“一个共和国，但（共和国的存续）则需要你们去守护 ” 。	Benjamin Franklin famously told the American people that the US Constitution would provide them with “a republic, if you can keep it.”
2000年开始的联合国千年发展目标将在2015年12月到期，这意味着实现全民普及小学教育的目标正在快速接近最后期限。	The UN Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, expire in December 2015, which means that time is running to meet the deadline for achieving the target of universal primary education.
因此，他对“美国价值观”的深层崇拜尽管是真心流露，但却不意味着乔治·W·布什总统的所作所为能得到赞同。	Thus, his deep admiration for “American values,” while sincere, implies no embrace of President George W. Bush.
毕竟，有关烟草行业的类似披露 — — 大型烟草企业知道些什么、什么时候知道的 — — 彻底改变了公共卫生状况。	After all, similar revelations about the tobacco industry – what the major cigarette companies knew and when they knew it – transformed the public-health landscape.
我在自己 2003 年出版的《金融新秩序：管理 21 世纪的风险》一书中，提出了另外一个不同的想法，我称之为“生计保险 ” 。	In my 2003 book, New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century, I proposed a different idea, which I called “livelihood insurance.”
很重要的一点是认识到大屠杀并不意味着以色列不可批评，也不意味着一切对以色列政策的抨击都可以归为反犹主义。	It is important to note that the Holocaust does not give Israel immunity from criticism, nor can every attack on Israel’s policies be dismissed as anti-Semitism.
美国财政部笨重的方案就是将有毒资产从银行资产负债表上剥离同时提供政府担保。 这一模式过于缺乏透明度而且复杂，因此，这一方案一经宣布，股市随即大跌。	And the very cumbersome US Treasury proposal – which combines removing toxic assets from banks’ balance sheets while providing government guarantees – was so non-transparent and complicated that the markets dove as soon as it was announced.
事实上，即使在执政期间，贝卢斯科尼也一直声称自己是司法机构、商业竞争对手 、 “ 共产主义分子”和政治机构的攻击对象。	Indeed, even while in office, Berlusconi consistently claimed that he was being attacked by the judiciary, by rival businessmen, by “communists,” by the political establishment.
当然，考虑到不同国家现有能源生产税收、费用和补贴的多样性，将碳的实际成本与最划算效率水平相协调需要一定时间才能实现。	Of course, given the multitude of existing taxes, fees, and subsidies on energy products in various countries, the goal of aligning the effective cost of carbon with its most economically efficient level would take time to achieve.
如果情况果真如此的话，欧洲央行可以令人信服地争辩说是默克尔的改革和美国，而不是它的提高利率应该为欧洲经济的放缓负责。	The ECB could convincingly argue that Merkel’s reforms and the US, not its interest-rate hikes, are responsible for the European slowdown, should one occur.
更重要的计划 — — 帮助那些因为贸易、技术或其他原因而落后的人的计划 — — 包括扩大的劳动收入税收优惠（Earned Income Tax Credit）和医疗保险。	More important programs – which could help those left behind by trade, technology, or something else – include an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit and health insurance.
中欧大学现在已经跻身社会科学领域全球前一百名大学之列 — — 这对于学术领域的新加入者是一种令人惊叹的成就。	CEU now ranks among the top 100 universities in the world in the social sciences – a remarkable achievement for an academic newcomer.
当前的安排方案规定中国政府可以否决任何它不喜欢的候选人，这助长了伊朗式选举的危机 ： “ 你们可以给任何我们所选择的人投票 。 ”	The current proposed arrangements would permit the Chinese government to veto any candidate that it did not like, prompting criticism that what is on offer is an Iranian-style election: “You can vote for anyone we choose.”
大部分以色列犹太人认为应该限制他们的阿拉伯国民的政治影响力，自决权等“重要的民族决定”只能留给犹太多数群体。	Most Israeli Jews believe that there should be limits on their Arab counterparts’ political influence, with “crucial national decisions,” such as self-determination, being left to the Jewish majority.
在随后的讨论中，一些FOMC成员认为通胀率应该调低至2%以下，但没有人认为如果通胀比这更低（但仍然为正）的话应该让通胀增加一点。	During the ensuing discussion, several FOMC members argued that the inflation rate might be reduced to less than 2%, but nobody argued that inflation should be pushed higher if a lower, but still positive, rate was achieved.
27岁的幼女之父、来自阿富汗喀布尔的MBA毕业生阿拉什（Aarash）说 ， “ 说尽做尽，我们几乎成为人 。 ”	As Aarash, a 27-year-old father of a young daughter and an MBA graduate from Kabul, Afghanistan, put it, “When all is said and done, we are only almost human.”
首先，由于来自中国的进口产品成本低廉，美国消费者只需支付更少的价格就能买到从鞋子到电子产品在内的各类商品。	For starters, thanks to low-cost imports from China, US consumers pay less for a wide range of goods, from shoes to electronics.
如果美国生产效率领先的确意味着让沃尔玛以及其他巨型零售企业为所欲为，那么这一增长源泉枯竭后又当如何呢？	If so much of the US productivity edge really amounts to letting Wal-Mart and its big-box cousins run amok, what will happen after this source of growth tapers off?
简言之，哈梅内伊不会容忍自身权力的削弱，并且决意避免与前任总统、特别是艾哈迈迪内贾德之间的矛盾再次产生。	Simply put, Khamenei will not tolerate any diminution of his power, and he is determined to avoid the type of friction that has characterized his relationships with previous presidents, particularly Ahmadinejad.
其实最符合各国利益的做法都是袖手旁观，以便重新勾起其殖民历史（科特迪瓦尤甚于利比亚，因为意大利也曾是其欧洲殖民国 ） 。	And in both cases, France had an obvious interest in not intervening, in order to erase its colonial past (more so in Côte d’Ivoire than in Libya, where Italy had been the European colonizer).
事实上，大选带来了诸多有益因素 — — 除了证明恣意妄为的公司资金无法收买大选，以及证明美国人口结构变迁宣判了共和党死刑之外。	In fact, the election had several salutary effects – beyond showing that unbridled corporate spending could not buy an election, and that demographic changes in the United States may doom Republican extremism.
一批国际智库正连同北约，欧盟委员会和几个国家的政府一道，组织一场在线讨论，时间定在 2 月 4 日 ~9 日。	A dozen international think tanks are organizing a worldwide on-line debate, to be held from February 4-9, in association with NATO, the European Commission, and several governments.
但既然15,000美军无法稳定缺少有胜任能力的包容性政府的伊拉克，目前所提出的有限措施也无法实现目标。	But if 150,000 US troops could not stabilize Iraq in the absence of an inclusive and competent government, the limited measures on offer now simply will not suffice.
已故的耶鲁经济学家古斯塔夫·拉尼斯（Gustav Ranis）在近20年前观察道，成功而可持续的发展的关键是“避免思维僵化 ” 。	As the late Yale economist Gustav Ranis observed nearly 20 years ago, the key to successful and sustainable development is “avoiding the encrustation of ideas.”
她和她的丈夫比尔对桑德斯继续竞选（尽管她在2008年也采取了同样的做法）感到恼火，更令她不快的是，桑德斯并未在批评她过往记录时有所淡化。	She and her husband, Bill, are annoyed with Sanders for continuing to campaign (even though she did the same in 2008) and for not toning down his critique of her record.
低通胀给过于友好的货币政策造成了虚假的安全感，导致资产和信用市场出现大量泡沫，从而引起实体经济的大扭曲。	Drawing false comfort from low inflation, overly accommodative monetary policies have led to massive bubbles in asset and credit markets, resulting in major distortions in real economies.
中国领导人不应该继续抓住达赖访问阿鲁纳恰尔邦的事件做文章，让冲突升级，而是应该冷静下来，让昨天的新闻大事化小。	Rather than escalate the conflict over the Dalai Lama’s visit further, China’s leaders should allow passions to subside and relegate the episode to yesterday’s news.
请看今日欧洲，德国总理默克尔、法国总统萨科齐屡屡苛责银行家们“愚蠢 ” ， 岂不也在纵容希腊人赖账的决心？	In Europe today, impatient Greeks have doubtless derived some encouragement from excoriations of bankers’ foolishness by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
比如，去年解放军在拉达克（Ladakh）的德普桑（Depsang）峡谷临时扎营，导致了与印度的紧张对峙。	For example, last year, Chinese troops established a temporary camp in Ladakh’s Depsang valley, leading to a high-stakes standoff with India.
而困境就在于：拥有大量资产的政府拥有灵活性和行动力，但它们同时也会因资产处置失当对市场和经济活力造成破坏。	Here is the dilemma: Governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act, but they can also mismanage their assets to the detriment of markets and economic dynamism.
但据英国历史学家安德鲁·派特里（Andrew Pettegree）介绍，自1517年到1546年路德逝世之间，当地的出版商“最少出版了2721部著作 ” ， 相当于“每年平均出版91本书 ” ， 总印量达300万册。	But, according to the British historian Andrew Pettegree, between 1517 and Luther’s death in 1546, local publishers “turned out at least 2,721 works” – and average of “91 books per year,” representing some three million individual copies.
有人认为，过去有关气候变化的协议走得不够远，但是 ， 《 京都议定书》实际上被证实是过于雄心勃勃了。	Some believe that past agreements did not go far enough, but Kyoto actually turned out to be overly ambitious.
20世纪的60、70和80年代，一个信念将倍受良知谴责的欧洲人联系在一起，那就是终有一天，他们的国家将在统一的欧洲大地上站稳脚跟。	What united prisoners of conscience in the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's was the faith that one day their countries would find their place in a united Europe.
是的，成功的经济体有许多共同的地方：它们都参与全球经济，维护整体经济稳定，鼓励储蓄和投资，提供市场导向型的激励措施，以及政府治理良好。	Yes, successful economies have many things in common: they all engage in the global economy, maintain macroeconomic stability, stimulate saving and investment, provide market-oriented incentives, and are reasonably well governed.
2012年2月，在卡斯商学院（Cass Business School）的演讲中，英国金融服务局前主席阿代尔·特纳（Adair Turner）指出，如果进一步从市场借钱在政治或金融上不可行，那么这也不失为一个选择。	In a lecture to the Cass Business School in February 2012, Adair Turner, former Chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority, proposed it as an option if further borrowing from the markets were politically or financially impossible.
在他的疯狂咆哮背后，给人的印象是在高涨的大男子主义掩盖下，隐藏着一个战战兢兢的小白人，心里清楚自己已经无法控制局势了。	Despite his rants and bluster, one still has the impression that behind that façade of pumped-up machismo lurks a frightened little white man who knows that he is no longer in control.
虽然也不是没有可以挑毛病的地方（有人说新计划只是削减现有再培训计划资金的借口 ） ， 但数字平台可以大规模改善再教育和培训的想法是靠谱的。	While it is easy to be cynical (some say the new program is just an excuse to cut funds from existing retraining programs), the idea that digital platforms can massively improve re-education and training is a good one.
随着恐惧心理在全世界消费者、企业以及各个国家之间的蔓延，人们谈论的话题已经从发达国家温和的经济衰退转变为严重的全球经济衰退。	With fear gripping consumers, companies, and countries worldwide, talk has turned from a moderate advanced-country recession to a major world depression.
即便如此，虽然中国将放弃其汇率管制以提升货币自主性的预测在过去十年内都被证伪，但这此情况可能有所不同。	Nonetheless, though predictions that China would abandon its exchange-rate controls in order to uphold monetary autonomy have proved wrong over the last decade, this time may be different.
伦敦国王学院国际激进化研究中心（ICSR）的希拉兹·马赫（Shiraz Maher）发现这些达伊莎新兵之间有一个共同点 ： “ 义愤、反抗、感到受到迫害，拒绝妥协 ” 。	Shiraz Maher of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization (ICSR) at King’s College London identifies a common thread of sentiment among recruits: “righteous indignation, defiance, a sense of persecution, and a refusal to conform.”
在布鲁金斯研究所（Brookings Institution）的罗伯特·利坦（Robert Litan）在其新著《万亿美元经济学家 》 （ Trillion Dollar Economists）中指出，经济学界“为美国和世界其他地区创造了数万亿美元收入和财富 。 ”	In his new book Trillion Dollar Economists, Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution argues that the economics profession has “created trillions of dollars of income and wealth for the United States and the rest of the world.”
2012年中国城镇人口占比52.6 % ， 较1980年的18%增长近3倍，且预计到2030年将占比近70 % 。	The urban share of the Chinese population reached 52.6% in 2012 – up nearly three-fold from 18% in 1980, and is expected to rise toward 70% by 2030.
这在冷战期间和20世纪90年代的巴尔干是许多美国行动的惯用模式，那时候，人们把这称之为“领导”而不是“单边主义 ” 。	This had been the pattern for many US initiatives during the Cold War, and in the Balkans during the 1990’s; back then, it was known as “leadership” rather than “unilateralism.”
因此，国会将何时开始逐渐调整这一年龄一推再推，立法成立时，这项调整只适用于当时45岁以下的人群，提高退休年龄政策完全实施要等到2027年。	Congress was therefore careful to delay the start of the gradual adjustment, applying it only to those below the age of 45 at the time of the legislation, with the higher retirement age to be fully phased in only in 2027.
没有一个新兴大国甚至已开始利用其日益增长的政治和经济影响力来推进他们真正的全球目标-或承担美国再也承担不起的责任。	None of the emerging powers has even begun to use its growing political and economic clout to advance truly global ambitions – or to take on responsibilities that Washington can no longer afford.
由此造成的工程和政策停顿 — — 烂尾的医院、意料外医疗供给短缺、建造了一半的桥梁 — — 给经济���成毁灭性的打击。	The resulting halts to projects or policies – half-built hospitals, unexpected shortages of medical supplies, bridges to nowhere – play havoc with their economies.
法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙、英国首相特雷莎·梅和德国总理安格拉·默克尔在说服特朗普承认联合全面行动计划方面的可耻失败是可以预见的。	The humiliating failure of French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to convince Trump to remain in the JCPOA was predictable.
这种方法能很好地跟踪通货膨胀的变化，但是在情形处于转折点时却作用不大，因为这些模型都忽视了潜在的或长期的影响因素。	This approach tracks inflation quite well, except at turning points , because the models miss key underlying or long-term influences.
奥巴马对叙利亚政策的解释或许是这样的 ： “ 叙利亚是一个困难的问题，如果处理不好，将威胁美国在该地区的利益。	Obama’s explanation of a Syrian policy might look something like this: “Syria is a difficult problem that, left unchecked, could threaten US interests in the region.
法国人所称的政教分离和世俗主义的区别对于土耳其而言要超过语言上的微妙不同。 在法国巩固了世俗共和国之后不久，土耳其也采纳了基马尔体制。	The difference between what the French call laicité and secularism is more than a linguistic nuance for Turkey, which adopted its Kemalist system not long after France entrenched its secular republic.
最近在法国、科威特和突尼斯发生的恐怖袭击都再次证明，明白在这些狂暴行为背后都有严肃的思想，而不仅仅是因为愤怒沮丧而犯下罪行。	The recent terrorist attacks in France, Kuwait, and Tunisia are only the latest reminders of how important it is to understand that, behind these outrages, there are serious ideas, not simply angry, frustrated criminals.
我们还必需与所有有关国家讨论确保增强金融稳定以及避免未来动乱的方案。 这也是四月份召开的二十国集团高峰会议的主题。	We must also ensure that solutions for strengthening financial stability and avoiding future turmoil – the focus of April’s G-20 summit – are discussed with all countries concerned.
在法国等低碳电网完善的国家，这未必是个问题，但在新斯科舍（Nova Scotia）等严重依靠煤炭的地方，这是个很大的问题。	That isn’t necessarily a problem in places with low-carbon electricity grids, like France, but it would be in a place like Nova Scotia, which relies heavily on coal.
事实上其中大部分成就都是在冷战时期取得的，而这同时也证明了一点：即便是在全球政治形势极端对立的情况下也是可以达成某些法律规范的。	Much of this progress was achieved during the Cold War, proving that it is possible to create global legal norms even in times of deep political division.
在《异乡异客》中，穆罕默德博士讲述了一个“庸俗”的美国角色，他“聒噪，可能还有些傲慢，而且几乎肯定是外省人 。 ”	In Stranger in a Strange Land, Dr. Mahmoud describes a “vulgar” American character who is “loud, probably ignorant, and almost certainly provincial.”
在该公司的报告内容里，一位患有短暂失忆症的妇女在听到机器人问“是否要来一碗雪糕”时露出了灿烂的笑容，欣然回答道 ： “ 好啊 ， ” 接着机器人大概就自动完成了余下的工作。	A woman with short-term memory loss broke into a big smile, the company reported, when the robot asked her, “Would you like a bowl of ice cream?” The woman answered “yes,” and presumably the robot did the rest.
用真实值（经通胀调整）衡量，美国联邦最低工资 — — 每小时7.25美元比1968年最高的时候低了三分之一。	The US federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is one-third lower in real (inflation-adjusted) terms than it was at its peak in 1968.
实施这些新规则和新工具可以加快从化石燃料项目撤资的总体趋势，确保向更有弹性的清洁能源经济平稳过渡，并为长期投资者提供信心和对未来的明确评估。	Implementing these new rules and tools can accelerate the overall trend in divestment from fossil fuels, ensure a smooth transition to a more resilient, clean-energy economy, and provide confidence and clarity for long-term investors.
今后25年，全球能源需求将增长近三分之一，上述增长主要出现在中国和印度等非经合组织国家，我们必须确保以尽可能可持续的方式满足上述需求。	Over the next 25 years, global demand for energy will increase by almost a third, primarily in non-OECD countries like China and India, and we must ensure that this demand is met in as sustainable a manner as possible.
现在人们担心的不再是它们是否置身度外，而是其经济可能会陷入比处于次贷危机震中的那些国家所遭受的更严重的危机中。	The fear is no longer that they will be unable to insulate themselves. It is that their economies could be dragged into much deeper crises than those that will be experienced at the epicenter of the sub-prime debacle.
注重创新的角度的核心是以下概念：经济增长需要技术转移和新企业能够形成、成长和退出（从而将生产要素重新配置给更加成功的企业）的环境。	Central to the innovation-focused perspective is the notion that economic growth requires technology transfers and an environment in which new firms can form, grow, and exit (thereby reallocating factors of production to more successful firms).
在2001年到2003年，当美国房屋市场和消费者支出对降低利率的激烈反应应该使这种争论变得没有意义的时候，对通货紧缩的担忧却不合时宜地增加了。	Deflation fears were mistakenly raised in 2001-2003, when the strong response of the US housing market and consumer spending to lower interest rates should have made the debate redundant.
我们希望客服我们的不同，通过TPP携手共筑二十一世纪亚洲和太平洋经济秩序并使之成为不可撼动的增长根基。	We intend to overcome our differences and together forge, in the form of the TPP, a twenty-first-century economic order for Asia and the Pacific that will serve as an unshakable foundation for growth.
我是小组中唯一的欧洲成员，在我看来，最重要的信息应该是美国不可继续如现在那样将自己视为“不可或缺的力量 ” ， 而是将自己视为“不可或缺的伙伴 ” 。	"From my perspective as the group's only European member, the overarching message should be that the US must conceive of itself not as “the indispensable power,"" as it now does, but as “the indispensable partner."""
这不是特朗普政府的责任，而是美联储的责任，而它在这方面的纪录相当抢眼：尽管自1990年以来货币赤字总额已达到14万亿美元，但美联储成功将通胀控制在较低水平。	That is not up to the Trump administration, but to the US Federal Reserve, which has a strong record on this front: despite a $14 trillion aggregate currency deficit on trade since 1990, the Fed has managed to keep inflation low.
印度人民党在很多层面上的投票都不太“和谐 ” ， 但最扎眼的是它反对印度上千年的行为而支持英国殖民地法律（而英国本身已经抛弃了该法律 ） 。	The BJP’s vote is incongruous on several levels, but most glaringly in its rejection of millennia of Indian practice in favor of a British colonial law (which the British themselves have outgrown).
因此，一些经济学家正在敦促欧洲央行更进一步，采取所谓的“直升机撒钱 ” — —即通过印钞来为私人消费融资。	That is why some economists are urging the ECB to go even further, with so-called “helicopter drops” – that is, financing private consumption by printing money.
也许中国应该利用其1.9万亿美元的官方储备来购买更多的外债，但这一巨额资产的很大一部分已经买了外国主权债券，因此任何的增加只能是渐进式的。	Perhaps China should use its $1.9 trillion official reserves to buy more foreign debt, but this huge asset pool is already heavily loaded with foreign sovereign bonds, so any increase can only be incremental.
然而时至今日，根据拉美研究学者迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen）的研究判断 ， “ 阿根廷社会的大多数人都是贝隆主义者 … … 贝隆创造了一个目前中产阶级享受的福利国家 。 ”	Yet today, according to the Latin America scholar Michael Cohen, “most of Argentine society is Perónist….Perón delivered a welfare state from which the current middle class benefits.”
新一代人 — — 受过高等教育，经验丰富，而且在很大程度上都是依靠自身的努力取得的成就 — — 正准备以高超的施政技巧和奉献精神来推动中国的经济和社会进步。	That generation – highly educated, experienced, and, for the most part, successful on their own merits – is prepared to carry China’s economic and social progress forward with great skill and dedication.
我们合作，不仅是因为这符合冷冰冰的金钱利益，也是因为各种道德感的综合效应 — — 忠诚、骄傲、罪恶、羞愧、愤怒、兴奋 — — 它让我们投入工作，也是我们结成团队的根源。	We cooperate not just because it is in our cold pecuniary interest to do so, but because a cocktail of moral sentiments – loyalty, pride, guilt, shame, outrage, glee – make us work and root for our team.
在未来几周，拉美国家将向巴勒斯坦权力机构寻求联合国承认巴勒斯坦国家地位或将其接纳为成员国的决议投赞成票。	In the coming weeks, most Latin American countries will vote in favor of some form of UN membership or recognition of statehood that the Palestinian Authority is seeking.
催生这次革命的或许是实际需要；但创造力与合作将证实从长远看这次革命能使全世界国家、企业和消费者有利可图。	This revolution may have been borne out of necessity; but, with ingenuity and cooperation, it will prove to be profitable, over the long run, for countries, manufacturers, and consumers worldwide.
因此被否决的提案都是些好政策：货币市场基金应该变得更加安全 — — 通过对资本的要求以及流动性限制 — — 因为他们已经获得了一个事实上的政府担保。	The rejected proposals are thus good policy: money-market funds should be made safer – via capital requirements and liquidity restrictions – because they already receive a de facto government guarantee.
尽管美国领导了20世纪90年代的互联网竞赛，但如今，美国是唯一一个没有明确的数字化计划的发达经济体。	Despite having led the Internet race in the 1990s, the US is now the only major developed economy without a clear digitization plan.
在美国的房屋价格和退休储蓄下降而中国的失业人数上升之时，观察家们担心无论美国还是中国都不太愿意削减它们的排放。	With American home values and retirement savings falling and Chinese unemployment numbers rising, observers worry that neither America nor China will have much appetite to cut emissions.
但是，随着新经济强国的崛起，它们开始日益挑战西方，它们的目标不仅仅是市场份额和资源；它们还将寻求往全球秩序中注入它们自身的文化体系（或软实力 ） 。	But, as new economic powerhouses rise, they will increasingly challenge the West, and not just for market share and resources; they will seek to infuse the global order with their own cultural understandings and frames of reference.
创造未来、避免战争、饥饿、疾病等人道主义灾难的艰苦斗争往往令我们鲜有余力从哲学的角度思考我们在这微不足道的宇宙尘埃上起什么作用。	The struggle to mold our future, to stave off the humanitarian disasters of war, disease, and starvation leaves little room to be philosophical about our place on this crumb of cosmic dust.
绝大多数联合国成员国认可UNRWA在动荡地区所扮演的独一无二的角色，也一直认可提供稳定的财政支持的必要性。	An overwhelming majority of UN member states, recognizing the unique role UNRWA plays in a volatile region, have consistently recognized the need to provide it with robust financial support.
让他们因为在上周日说“不”而不得不付出代价将是一个极其悲哀的悲剧 — — 与前两次说“不”相比，这一次不可不谓是滑稽的模仿。	Nothing would be sadder than to see them also have to pay for last Sunday’s “No” – a farcical simulation of those earlier noble acts of defiance.
在斯里兰卡，决心重夺权力的前总统煽动信仰佛教的僧伽罗人的种族沙文主义，对计划中的与被征服种族、信仰印度教的泰米尔人的和解嗤之以鼻。	In Sri Lanka, the ethnic chauvinism of the Buddhist Sinhalese, stirred by a former president determined to reclaim power, mocks the supposed goal of reconciliation with the vanquished Hindu Tamils.
在2015年第四季度的信贷增长 — — 在中国被称为“社会融资总量 ” — —实现了13％的年化增长率 — — 相当于全年GDP增速的两倍。	Credit growth, known in China as “total social financing,” grew at an annual rate of 13% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and again in the first quarter of this year – that is, double the rate of annual GDP growth.
但是，心理学在投机市场上也会起作用，或许格林兰冰川的消融使所有其它的事物 — — 土地，水，甚至是新鲜空气 — — 也都快用完了似乎成为事实。	But psychology also matters in speculative markets, and perhaps that image of the Greenland ice disappearing makes it seem all too plausible that everything else– land, water, even fresh air – is running out too.
特朗普与台湾套近乎、子虚乌有地攻击中国、废除TPP，这样的做法既是在挑衅中国，同时也在加强中国的实力和能力。	By moving closer to Taiwan, attacking China on phantom grounds, and dismantling the TPP, Trump is provoking China while simultaneously empowering and enabling it.
尽管有一些春天的萌芽，但我们还是应该为下一个黑暗的冬天做好准备：是时候实施第二套银行重组的方案了，也是时候再打一剂凯恩斯主义的强心针了。	In spite of some spring sprouts, we should prepare for another dark winter: it’s time for Plan B in bank restructuring and another dose of Keynesian medicine.
这个数字会逐年增加，因为随着桥梁结构的不断瓦解，修复它们的成本只会更高；随着海平面和气温的持续升高，森林火灾的加剧，降低灾害损失的成本也会增加。	That figure increases every year, because as bridges continue to weaken, it costs even more to fix them; and as sea levels and temperatures continue to rise, and as forest fires become more severe, it costs more to mitigate the damage.
即便少得可怜的探索可能存在的危险的相关研究也缺乏明确的研究方向，无法令人相信其所开发出的信息能够帮助决策者确保纳米技术被长期安全地开发。	Even the small handful of relevant studies exploring possible risks lacked a guiding focus, giving no indication that the information developed would help decision-makers ensure that nanotechnology is developed safely over the long term.
在一些社区，多元化的政治和民族成分走到了一起，同意建设“安全校园区 ” （ Safe School Zone ） 。	In some communities, diverse political and ethnic groups have come together and agreed to develop “Safe School Zones.”
不幸的是，尽管由联邦政府承担部分开支合情合理，但两位候选人都不能确保这笔钱因为政治化或裙带关系而浪费。	Unfortunately, while a portion of this is appropriate for the federal government, neither candidate has ensured that money wouldn’t be misspent through politicization or cronyism.
类似地，2014年莫迪曾对学生说，气候变化不是一个环境问题；相反，这是一个人类应对随时间变化的冷暖情况的能力的问题。	Likewise, Modi told schoolchildren in 2014 that climate change is not an environmental problem; it is, instead, a matter of human beings’ capacity to cope with heat and cold, which changes over time.
尽管未来十年税收法案所引起的1.5万亿美元政府借款可能挤压掉等量的私人借款，但资本存量的增长会更多。	Although the $1.5 trillion of government borrowing caused by the tax bill during the next decade could crowd out an equal amount of private borrowing, the capital stock will grow by an even larger amount.
英语不是通用语的国家在科研方面处境尤其不利，这绝非因为他们学术科研水平不高，而是因为科学界由英语期刊来扮演发号施令的角色。	Countries where English is not the lingua franca are particularly disadvantaged in science, not because they lack academic excellence, but because English-language journals call the shots.
而各国首脑内部及其与欧洲央行之间在购买危机受灾国主权债券方面的意见不一致只是增加了整个事件的不确定性而已。	Disagreement among and between heads of state and the ECB over the Bank’s purchases of distressed sovereign debt have only added to the uncertainty.
即使西方国家及其当地盟友（库尔德人、叙利亚反对派、约旦和其他逊尼派阿拉伯国家）能就由谁提供大量地面部队达成一致，伊斯兰国也已经调整了自己的战略。	Even if the West and its local allies (the Kurds, the Syrian opposition, Jordan, and other Sunni Arab countries) could agree about who would provide the bulk of ground troops, ISIS has already reshaped its strategy.
作为一个谨慎和严守纪律的政治家 — — 不愧是牧师家的女儿 — — 梅从不玩弄真相，也不会去冒不必要的风险或踏出一伙忠心耿耿的顾问团队为她营造的安全区域。	A cautious and disciplined politician – a vicar’s daughter, no less – May doesn’t play around with the truth, nor does she take unnecessary risks or stray beyond a comfort zone populated by a tightknit group of advisers.
此外，非洲和亚洲的金融技术公司正在寻找创新方式来分析贫困人口活动所产生的数据，并利用相关数据来设计和提供更高质量的银行服务。	Moreover, financial technology firms in Africa and Asia are finding innovative ways to analyze data generated by poor people’s activities, and using that data to design and deliver better banking services.
如果说正常时期需要一位保守的中央银行家来稳定通胀预期，在如今这个非常时期我们需要更加非正统的中央银行家来对抗通缩预期。	If normal times call for a conservative central banker who helps to anchor inflation expectations, now is the rare time when we need a more unorthodox central banker who will fight deflation expectations.
两国都在寻求为亚洲建立可行的和平结构，这个结构将允许中国继续成长和繁荣，也将阻止任何国家的霸权行为。	Both countries seek to create a viable structure of peace for Asia, one that allows China to continue to grow and prosper, but that prevents any one country from claiming hegemony.
凯恩斯主义者宣称“需求”主宰一切 — — 增加就业，从而提振投资乃至增长全靠需求 — — 这站不住脚。	Keynesians’ claim that “demand” is all-powerful – that it alone increases employment and thus investment and even growth – was groundless.
在弗朗西斯·福山宣告“历史结束”不到四分之一世纪后，我们似乎面对一个社会及地缘政治巨变的新时代的开始。	Less than a quarter-century after Francis Fukuyama declared “the end of history,” we seem to have arrived at the dawn of a new age of social and geopolitical upheaval.
合作的信号很明显：越来越多地使用阿拉伯语而不是法语、讨论伊斯兰教经文中的实际知识并且承认伊斯兰教依然与传统做法有所不同。	The signs of cooperation have been clear: increasing use of Arabic, rather than French, discussions that incorporate real knowledge of Islamic scripture, and recognition that Islam remains distinct from traditional practices.
但金融市场第一次对欧盟某个银行的储户将会失去其部分存款这一新闻反应平静（在柏林和北欧一些地方这个消息被高兴地指了出来 ） 。	But financial markets reacted calmly to the news that, for the first time, even depositors in a bank in the European Union will lose part of their money (and this was noted with glee in Berlin and elsewhere in northern Europe).
但你永远不可能从（比如）德国财长朔伊布勒（Wolfgang Schäuble）吹嘘德国美德时听说这一点。	But one would never know that from listening, for example, to Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, extolling his country’s virtues.
对于卡扎菲这个曾试图暗杀阿卜杜拉国王，甚至连续十多年资助反沙特宣传的利比亚领导人沙特王室可没什么好感。	The Kingdom has no love for Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi, who tried to assassinate King Abdullah and has waged a concerted anti-Saudi propaganda campaign for at least a decade.
此外，IMF — — 而不是G-20 — — 应该扮演更积极的角色，成为真正的全球宏观经济政策协调工具。	This should be combined with a more active role for the IMF – rather than the G-20 – as the true instrument of global macroeconomic policy coordination.
毕竟，如果当你可以投资于房地产、股票市场或者高收益的企业债券时，何必持有5%回报可怜的美国国债、4%回报的德国债券或者0.5%的日本政府债券呢？	After all, why hold US T-bills with a meager 5% return, German Bunds with a 4% return, or Japanese government bonds with a 0.5% return when you can acquire foreign firms, invest in real assets, stock markets, or higher-yielding corporate bonds?
这导致了流向欧元区南部成员国的资本流突然断流，迫使这些国家的经常项目从五年前的3000亿美元赤字（总和）转变为如今的略有盈余。	This was a consequence of the sudden stop of capital flows to the eurozone’s southern members, which forced these countries to turn their current accounts from a combined deficit of $300 billion five years ago to a small surplus today.
如果人均收入可以作为评判标准，那么摩纳哥、卡塔尔、卢森堡、文莱、列支敦士登、科威特、挪威和新加坡都比美国排名靠前。	If per capita income were the criterion by which to judge, Monaco, Qatar, Luxembourg, Brunei, Liechtenstein, Kuwait, Norway, and Singapore would all rank ahead of the US.
我的同事刘遵义（Larry Lau）和我估算，科技变迁贡献了近几十年来G7经济体经济增长的大约一半。	My colleague Larry Lau and I estimate that technical change is responsible for roughly half the economic growth of the G7 economies in recent decades.
如果共和党强制执行某种形式的政府支付排序，完全可能造成政府部分关闭的后果。 有些人将拿到欠款、有些人则不能。	As a result, a partial government shutdown is entirely possible, with the Republicans imposing a form of prioritization on government payments: some people will be paid what they are owed, and others will not.
巴勒斯坦人具有强烈的民族认同感，他们宣布他们具有明确一致的目标，那就是结束以色列的占领并建立一个独立民主的国家。	With a strong sense of national identity, Palestinians boasted that they had a clear unifying purpose: ending the Israeli occupation and establishing an independent and democratic state.
而将这些武装人员整合到一个生产性经济中则需要转变一系列政策，包括迅速重启农村发展计划并鼓励当地小企业，公共服务以及其他合法经营行为的发展。	To reintegrate these fighters into the productive economy will require a change in policies, including a rapid reactivation of rural development schemes and the promotion of local entrepreneurship, public works, and other legal activities.
德国跨国企业蒂森克虏伯正在开发利用钢铁生产所过程中产生的废气生产化工产品和合成天然气的工艺，从而降低碳污染。	And the German multinational thyssenkrupp is developing a process using exhaust fumes from steel production as a feedstock for chemical products and synthetic natural gas, lowering carbon pollution.
对当今的短缺和商品高价的解释专注于新兴国家的爆炸式增长，特别是中国和印度的增长，并认为这两个国家对稀缺资源的需求是“无底洞 ” 。	The usual explanation of today’s scarcity and high prices focuses on explosive growth in emerging countries, China and India in particular, whose demand for scarce resources is “insatiable.”
此外，多哈谈判还建立了一个单一谈判平台，并为新协定的出台划定了2015年的期限 — — 这是一个比大部分评论者和政府所认识到的重要得多的成就。	Moreover, a single negotiation platform has been established, and a 2015 deadline for concluding a new agreement has been set – a much more significant accomplishment than most commentators or governments have recognized.
尽管亚洲国家在这方面已经有了长足的进步，但在非洲国家，生活在极端贫困中的人口却比1990年增长了1亿4千万。	Although good progress in meeting these goals has been made in Asia, in Africa there are now 140 million more people living in extreme poverty than there were in 1990.
2015年11月15日，位于柏林韦尔德市场大街的德国外交部下属移民指挥中心追踪了从希腊到德国的每一个潜在过境点的难民人流。	On November 15, 2015, a migration command center in the German Foreign Ministry on Werderscher Markt in Berlin was tracking refugee flows at every potential border crossing on the route from Greece to Germany.
中投公司选择在一个子公司高持股，而不是整个集团的低持股，因为这样做既能提供战略优势（获得能源 ） ， 又能提供货币好处（投资于美元计价资产 ） 。	CIC chose to take a significant share in one branch, rather than a small share in the whole group, because doing so offered both a strategic advantage (access to energy resources) and a monetary benefit (investment in dollar-denominated assets).
因此对量化宽松政策潜在负面影响效应的担忧其实是被过度放大了，况且如果最终想逆向回收这一政策的话也没有太大的难度。	Thus, concerns about QE’s supposed ill effects are wildly overblown, and there is nothing especially challenging about eventually reversing course, either.
能源和能源密集型产业的增长将助力大范围支持性活动的需求、产出和就业增长，包括运输业、建筑业和专业服务。	Growth in energy and energy-intensive industries will fuel additional demand, output, and employment across a wide swath of supporting activities, including transportation, construction, and professional services.
当他宣读完报告全文时，与会的三千名代表向他报以热烈掌声；这不仅仅是出于例行礼节，更对温家宝作为中国国家政府领导人所取得成就的赞誉与致敬	When he had finished, the 3,000 representatives in attendance gave him a resounding ovation that was surely a response to more than the report; it was a display of praise and respect for his achievements as the head of China’s government.
但是，十多年以后，这四个国家的唯一共同点是它们是仅有的位列世界前15大经济体（经购买力平价调整）但又不属于经合组织成员的国家。	But, more than a decade later, just about the only thing that these countries have in common is that they are the only economies ranked among the world’s 15 largest (adjusted for purchasing power) that are not members of the OECD.
在美国，反型脂肪的消费占总能量摄入的2-4 % ， 主要来源是深度油炸的快餐、糕点（包括蛋糕、饼干、松饼、馅饼等 ） 、 包装小食品、人造黄油和面包。	In the US, consumption of trans fats averages between 2-4% of total energy, with major sources being deep fried fast foods, bakery products (cakes, cookies, muffins, pies, etc.), packaged snack foods, margarines, and breads.
安倍尤其强调增强日本与美国的联盟关系。 美日关系因为民主党政府的软弱行为而受损（于中国关系也是如此 ） 。	Abe has placed particular emphasis on strengthening Japan’s alliance with the Unites States, which had atrophied as a result of the DPJ government’s feckless behavior (relations with China deteriorated as well).
较长期的趋势也改善了。 自世纪之交以来（这段时间，死亡人口超过了出生人口，比率为7比4 ） ， 由于政府给生育第三胎发放大量补贴，生育率从1999年每位妇女生育1.16个孩子的低谷上升到了2010年的1.58个孩子，快速的人口衰退已停止。	But Russia remains essentially a “rentier state” – that is, a state whose primary source of revenue is rent – in this case, oil and gas – rather than taxation, which thus keeps demands for political representation at bay.
在苏联自己的阿富汗战争结束近三十年后 — — 恰恰是阿富汗战争导致苏联经济衰落并破坏了这个共产主义国家 — — 俄罗斯已经开始树立自己在阿富汗事务中的核心角色。	Almost three decades after the end of the Soviet Union’s own war in Afghanistan – a war that enfeebled the Soviet economy and undermined the communist state – Russia has moved to establish itself as a central actor in Afghan affairs.
但是，流动性供应 — — 如果不尽快辅之以重塑增长的政策的话 — — 仍然只能推迟而不能阻止货币联盟的解体，最终导致经济/贸易联盟的崩溃和单一市场的毁灭。	But, again, liquidity provision alone – without policies to restore growth soon – would merely delay, not prevent, the breakup of the monetary union, ultimately taking down the economic/trade union and leading to the destruction of the single market.
当然 ， “ 人民轴心”也不会将美国人排除在外：美国商界和非营利组织的活力，创造性和资源已经遍布全球。	Here, the pivot to the people includes the American people: the dynamism, creativity, and resources of American business and non-profit organizations already engaged around the world.
没有美国安全伞下的遏制政策，红军就会扼杀东欧的自由之梦，也许也会统一欧洲，但却在绣着红星的旗帜之下。	Without the policy of containment under America's security umbrella, the Red Army would have strangled the dream of freedom in Eastern Europe, or brought European unity, but under a flag with red stars.
前提很明确：由于危机的影响比从前都更为显著，各国之间的互相依存已经成为无法回避的事实，况且也没有另外一条道路可供选择。	The premise is clear: as the crisis made more evident than ever, the interdependence of countries is inescapable. In the face of today’s global challenges, the only possible response must be global.
军方不久前的攻击行动也证实了这一点，他们更多的依赖威胁平民安全的空袭，而不是能够精确实现军事目标的地面进攻。	The military’s recent offensive reflects this, relying on air strikes that imperiled civilians rather than a ground offensive that would have been more precise in achieving its objectives.
西班牙托雷多 - - 三个月前在安那波利斯开启的巴以和平会谈并不缺乏对于如何解决双方冲突的核心问题的想法。	TOLEDO, SPAIN – The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that began three months ago at Annapolis do not suffer from a lack of ideas about how to address the conflict’s core issues.
在临刑前，贝•布托被允许见父亲最后一面。 她在自传中写道 ： “ 我在他的死囚牢房里发誓，我将继续他的事业 。 ”	Hours before his hanging, Benazir was allowed to see her father for the last time, writing in her autobiography: “I told him on my oath in his death cell, I would carry on his work.”
在世界各国将目光聚焦12月全民健康覆盖日时，我独自反思过去几年的恐怖状况，思考我们应当采取哪些措施来改善未来的医疗保健工作。	As the world observed Universal Health Coverage Day in December, I was left to reflect on the horrors of the last few years, and consider what steps we must take to improve health care in the future.
比方说四年前，我刚刚就任的时候，多数全球领导人谈起气候变化这个时代议题时都知之甚少，但现在气候变化的影响已经深入人心、随处可见。	For example, four years ago, when I came to office, only a handful of global leaders knew enough even to talk about climate change – the defining challenge of our times, whose effects we see every day, all around us.
在 2013年5月的国防大学（National Defense University）演讲中，奥巴马信誓旦旦地表示，在阿富汗战场之外，除非“几乎肯定不会有平民伤亡 ， ” 否则就不会实施无人机打击。	In a May 2013 speech at the National Defense University, Obama offered assurances that, outside the Afghan war theater, no drone strike would be carried out unless there was “near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured.”
定居香港或者圣地亚哥、智利将每天将多消耗1“微生存率 ” ， 而生活在世界污染最严重的城市之一新德里每天则多消耗4-5个“微生存率 ” 。	Living in Hong Kong or Santiago, Chile, will cost one additional microlife per day, whereas daily life in New Delhi, one of the world’s most polluted cities, costs an estimated 4-5 microlives.
在法院判决之下，阿根廷只能在偿付了反对者的同时才能向新债券的持有者进行偿付，同时也没有美国金融机构能作为为阿根廷进行支付的中间人。	Under the court order, Argentina may not pay the holders of the new bonds unless it also pays the holdouts, and no US financial institution can serve as an intermediary to make payments for Argentina.
美国可以迫使巴沙尔政权回到谈判桌上，真心实意地寻求和解，至少可以让巴沙尔明确知道要想随心所欲地重建统治是不可能的。	It would either force the regime back to the negotiating table with a genuine intention of reaching a settlement, or at least make it clear that Assad will not have a free hand in re-establishing his rule.
他们认为应当签署所有国家都认可的协议 — — 符合科学要求和各国的能力状况，以“绿色就业”和“绿色增长”为基础，打造二十一世纪全球经济的生命线。	They recognized the need for an agreement that all nations can embrace – in line with their capabilities, consistent with what science requires, and grounded in “green jobs” and “green growth,” the lifeline of a twenty-first century global economy.
至少从托马斯·阿奎那的《神学大全 》 （ Summa Theologica，1265—1274年）出版以来，自然定律和黄金规则（Golden Rule）就被认为是教会理论的基本支柱。	At least since the publication of Thomas Aquinas’s Summa Theologica (1265-74), natural law and the Golden Rule have been viewed as the fundamental pillars of the Church’s teachings.
在对这次“闪电崩盘”深入的分析过程中，英格兰银行的安迪•霍尔丹称，尽管股票市场日益资本化可能与金融发展和经济增长有关，但是市场成交量和增长之间没有这种关系。	Haldane cites a striking statistic: in 1945, the average investor held the average US share for four years. By 2000, the average holding period had fallen to eight months; by 2008, it was two months.
为公平以及效率起见，权利和利益不应取决于公司或就业状况，而是要与个人挂钩，同时应该可以在所有行业和岗位之间自由转移。	For fairness as well as for efficiency reasons, rights and benefits should be attached to individuals, not to companies or employment status, and should be fully portable across sectors and jobs.
41%的意大利人口只接受过基础教育，这一比例远高于其他大部分欧洲国家（葡萄牙、马耳他和西班牙除外 ） 。	Some 41% of Italy’s population has only a basic education, a considerably higher share than in most other European countries (with the exceptions of Portugal, Malta, and Spain).
但这一指控与事实是矛盾的：人民币目前估值公允，中国实际上一直在干预市场支持人民币汇率，而不是让它进一步贬值。	But that accusation would be contrary to the facts: the renminbi is now fairly valued, and China has actually been intervening to support the exchange rate, not weaken it further.
毕竟2008年的危机灾难之前，那些金融和工业巨头们可以吹嘘全球化、科技发展和金融自由化的优点 — — 这本该预示着一个增长持续不断的新时代。	After all, before the meltdown in 2008, the captains of finance and industry could trumpet the virtues of globalization, technology, and financial liberalization, which supposedly heralded a new era of relentless growth.
类似地，我们可以看到俄罗斯产民用飞机在国际公司和合作下进入全球市场，特别是那些可以在先进ICT设备上与俄罗斯公司合作的企业。	Similarly, we might see new Russian-built civilian aircraft entering the global market in partnership with international firms, especially those that can work with Russian companies on advanced ICT avionics.
而人们也越来越意识到：这些小农场生产者以及她们所在的农村社区将是解决是粮食安全以及贫困问题的重要组成部分 — — 但这必须得在她们得到了必要的协助之后。	There is growing recognition that these smallholder farmers and their rural communities are a major part of the solution to food insecurity and poverty – but only if they have what they need to do their jobs.
发自安大略 — — 十二月，世界各地的贸易部长将齐聚布宜诺斯艾利斯参加世界贸易组织（WTO）第十一次部长级会议。	ONTARIO – This December, trade ministers from around the world will converge in Buenos Aires for the World Trade Organization’s 11th Ministerial Conference.
麦肯锡公司分析了美国和欧盟1995—2008年的就业创造情况，结果表明，美国创造了2 000万个新岗位，其中1 900万个可以归因于人口增加。	An analysis by McKinsey & Company of new jobs in the US and the EU from 1995 to 2008 suggests that, while the US created 20 million new jobs, 19 million of them were attributable to population growth.
同一个月，巴西顶尖生物医学研发中心 — — Bio-Manguinhos在盖茨基金会的合作下宣布计划生产麻疹和风疹联合疫苗。	The same month, Brazil’s top biomedical research and development center, Bio-Manguinhos, in partnership with the Gates Foundation, announced plans to produce a combined measles and rubella vaccine.
我们只能希望，它不要再搞支出扩张了，这条路已经证明是走不通的，而且让日本成了经合组织中债务负担最高的国家（约为GDP的230 % ） 。	One can only hope that it will not indulge in more of the kind of spending that already has proven so ineffective – and that has left Japan with the highest debt burden (around 230% of GDP) in the OECD.
我猜想，美国政府没有做到它应该做的一切的原因能以三个字来描述：参议员约翰·沃诺维奇，他是参议院的第60投票，这个投票是结束辩论并通过一项法案的必须的投票。	My guess is that the reason that the US government is not doing all it should can be stated in three words: Senator George Voinovich, who is the 60th vote in the Senate – the vote needed to close off debate and enact a bill.
过去50年，政府拥有大量商业资产引发了观点截然不同的辩论，尤其是在欧洲，但最近美国也出现了类似的情况。	For the last 50 years, government ownership of vast commercial holdings has triggered a polarized debate, especially in Europe, but recently also in the United States.
考虑到当今战略核武器和反核武器系统，你无法排除某一方或第三方的的某个行动方可能会发出挑衅令事态升级。	Given the complexity of today’s strategic nuclear weapons and the systems designed to neutralize them, one cannot rule out the possibility that some actor on either side, or a third party, could provoke escalation.
新闻集团在美国的主要面目就是以福克斯新闻网的形式展现出来，而该频道则充斥着对右翼意识形态的各式宣传。	This is News Corporation’s main face in the US, in the form of Fox News, whose hallmark has been relentless propagation of right-wing ideology.
发展中国家在这一进程中已经落后，但是，随着全球变暖的共��威胁，现在采纳保护环境政策的压力越来越大。	Developing countries have lagged behind in this process, but, with the common threat of global warming, there is now growing pressure to adopt conservation policies.
尽管这带来的是可比性甚低的指标族，仍然有待标准化，但这些努力是令人鼓舞的信号 — — 微观金融业开始致力于捍卫其在金融服务生态系统中的地位。	While this has resulted in a rather disparate set of indicators, which must be standardized, such efforts are an encouraging sign of the microfinance industry’s commitment to securing its role in the financial-services ecosystem.
正像东盟不能也不愿对抗中国对南海的侵略一样，欧盟已经觉察到用软实力和以共识为基础的方法来抗拒俄罗斯有很多不尽人意之处。	And, just as ASEAN has been unable and unwilling to stand up to China over its encroachment in the South China Sea, the EU is already discovering the limits of its soft-power, consensus-driven approach to Russia.
在巴勒斯坦问题上没有取得确实进展之前，温和的阿拉伯国家政权不会敢于同以色列开展公开和认真的建立友好关系的进程。	Moderate Arab regimes will not dare to engage in an open and serious process of rapprochement with Israel in the absence of real progress over the Palestinian issue.
在这一建设性、前瞻性的正义理解的前提下，桑托斯也可以获得成功，从而确保哥伦比亚人民获得他们应该得到的和平、安全的未来。	With this constructive, forward-looking understanding of justice in mind, Santos, too, can succeed, thereby securing the peaceful, secure future that Colombians deserve.
尽管2007—2009年拜深度全球衰退所赐出现了重大回撤，但金融流和商品和服务贸易总价值在2012年仍占全球GDP的36 % ， 比1980年高1.5倍。	Despite a significant contraction from 2007 to 2009, resulting from the deep global recession, the combined value of financial flows and trade in goods and services was 36% of global GDP in 2012 – 1.5 times higher than in 1980.
但是他们的研究结论不应是对我们所感兴趣的经济和金融力量的唯一描述，而一直以来泰勒都是一项已经证明这一观点的行为研究计划的主要贡献者。	But their results are not the only descriptions of economic and financial forces that should interest us, and Thaler has been a major contributor to a behavioral research program that has demonstrated this.
金融分析师对于GDP增长是否会降到7%以下十分紧张，试图在官方陈述中挖掘政府是否会采取行动的蛛丝马迹。	Financial analysts are in a tizzy over whether GDP growth will fall below 7%, parsing official statements for clues as to whether and when the government will act.
在这个几乎一半移民都是从一个发展中国家搬到另一个发展中国家的世界，移民的问题也就不仅仅只是西方国家的问题了。	And, in a world in which nearly half of migrants are now moving from one developing country to another, the problems are no longer confined to the West.
同样，真主党已经感受到了胜利的滋味，但还不是胜利的现实（叙利亚和伊朗对此一直虎视眈眈 ） 。 他们可能更为顽固。	Similarly Hezbollah, having tasted the sense but not the reality of victory (and egged on by Syria and Iran) may prove recalcitrant.
此次金融危机来势汹汹，不仅让我们看到了全球经济增长的不稳定性，风险和不平衡性；也告诉我们，在危机发生之前，没能“预见”到不断增加的系统性风险的存在。	The financial crisis, morphing quickly into a global economic downturn, resulted not just from a failure to react to growing instability, risk, and imbalance, but also from a widespread pre-crisis inability to ”see” the rising systemic risk.
如果今天的交易行为并没有让资本流向用处最大的地方，那么对未被有效利用的金融人才给予重新配置能产生相当大的好处。	If trading today is not helping to move capital to its highest and best use, reallocating inefficiently employed financial talent could yield big benefits.
应对气候变化的第二个措施称为“适应 ” ， 要求我们为正在发生的气候变化以及未来年间要发生的更大的气候变化做好准备。	The second response to climate change, called “adaptation,” requires that we ready ourselves for the climate change now underway and the increased climate change to come in future years.
教学内容还包括有关情绪的基础知识，以及几项展示思考和感觉之间联系的认知治疗练习，讲授的内容还包括当无法化解的危机降临时，参与者怎样才能给予自己最好的照顾。	The classes also include basic education about our moods, and several exercises from cognitive therapy that show the links between thinking and feeling and how participants can best look after themselves when a crisis threatens to overwhelm them.
到2030年，今天的发展中和新兴国家有望产出世界GDP的近60 % ， 而2000年只有40%左右，这让它们在世界舞台上的作用更大了。	Today’s developing and emerging countries are likely to account for nearly 60% of world GDP by 2030, up from around 40% in 2000, enabling them to play a much greater role on the world stage.
这两种支柱方法组成了对于来自短期经济分析与那些来自长期货币分析的指数进行反复核对的框架，以便得出对于影响价格稳定的风险因素的一个坚实的观点。	This two pillar approach constitutes a framework for cross-checking indications from the shorter-term economic analysis with those from the longer-term monetary analysis in order to obtain a robust view about the risks to price stability.
中国对关注作为其主要贸易伙伴和竞争对手的美国以及南亚和伊朗 — — 这些国家为中国供应许多石油并认为中国是比俄罗斯更可靠的盟友 — — 的兴趣远远比对俄罗斯大。	China is far more interested in focusing on the United States, its major trade partner and rival, and on South Asia and Iran, which supplies much of China’s oil and regards it as a more reliable ally than Russia.
人们常常忘记了这样一个事实，那就是美国国防部长拉姆斯菲尔德在经历了闲适的退休生活后又重新出山，本着上面提到的原则将美国军队改组为更小、也更灵活的作战团体。	It is often forgotten that US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emerged from a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American military into a smaller, more agile force, using some of these same insights.
根据2009年完成的最新的（被高度政治化的）人口普查，内罗毕人口超过300万；但也许其人口有接近500万，其中很大一部分生活在贫民窟。	According to the last (highly politicized) census, completed in 2009, Nairobi has a population of over three million; but it is probably closer to five million, with a large percentage living in slums.
当一个让夏天平静下来的妥协计划达成后，谈判者们会想，这下可以好好休息一下了。 而此时正是大惊喜即将爆发的时候。	When a compromise package has been agreed that makes the summer look calm, when the negotiators think that they have earned a good rest – this is the moment for the brilliant surprise.
这一回冲击来自欧洲。 肆虐欧洲的主权债务危机似乎要把小规模衰退变成一场大危机：希腊可能退出欧元区，这将在整个欧元区引发动荡蔓延。	This time it is from Europe, where a raging sovereign-debt crisis threatens to turn a mild recession into something far worse: a possible Greek exit from the euro, which could trigger contagion across the eurozone.
而与此同时，据美国政府统计，墨西哥境内的罂粟和大麻的种植面积分别扩大到了 6900 公顷和 8900 公顷。	Meanwhile, acreage used for poppy and marijuana production has risen, according to the US government, to 6,900 and 8,900 hectares, respectively.
众所周知，或者我们应该知道，要如何建立可以接受维持个体经济稳定局面任务的政治体系以及如何建立金融机构去动用承受风险能力分散风险。	We know, or at least we ought to know, how to build political institutions that accept the mission of macroeconomic stabilization, and how to build financial institutions to mobilize risk-bearing capacity and spread risk.
如果教育投资回报继续下降，那么维持学生贷款将挤出其他消费和投资项，特别是在学生贷款拥有很高的资本结构地位的情况下。	If the return on investment in education continues to decline, the servicing of student loans will tend to crowd out other consumption and investment outlays, especially given that student debt has considerable seniority in the capital structure.
但是，尽管渐进调整才是关键之举，但过快过深的削减很可能会适得其反：私人信用和政府支出的大量削减将导致更剧烈的减速，从而造成衰退的恶性循环。	But, while gradual adjustment is essential, faster and deeper cuts are largely self-defeating: big reductions in private credit and government spending will cause a sharper slowdown – and thus a vicious downward spiral.
即将到来的美国-东盟峰会的一些出席领导人 — — 如统治柬埔寨25年之久的洪森 — — 此前被奥巴马认为过于残酷和专制，不容踏上美国领土。	The upcoming US-ASEAN summit will include leaders – like Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for 25 years – who were previously considered too ruthless and repressive to be received by the US president on American soil.
尽管美国参议院最初拒绝了威尔逊的方案，特别是其加入国联的主张，但到了1933年后，富兰克林·罗斯福修改了自由国际主义方案。	Though the US Senate initially rejected Wilson’s vision, particularly his support for joining the League of Nations, Franklin D. Roosevelt revived liberal internationalism after 1933.
甚至有消息说俄罗斯和中国正在建立一个国际支付系统，以取代可被美国和欧洲用来对俄罗斯实施金融制裁的SWIFT系统。	There is even talk of Russia and China creating an alternative international payment system to replace the SWIFT system, which the US and Europe can use to impose financial sanctions against Russia.
这反映了基础性（和历史性）经济和财政再联盟、政策应对不力、以及让结构变革陷入停顿的系统性僵化所产生的后果。	It reflects the impact of fundamental (and historic) economic and financial re-alignments, insufficient policy responses, and system-wide rigidities that frustrate structural change.
2005年，只有15位民主党众议员投票支持中美洲自由贸易协定（Central American Free Trade Agreement ） ， 原因正是劳动标准和环境保护条款太弱。	In 2005, only 15 House Democrats voted for the Central American Free Trade Agreement, precisely because its terms on labor standards and the environment were so weak.
巴勒斯坦人要决定民族权力机构的主席是只起象征作用还是像现在一样实权在握，后一种选择会使库赖像很多巴勒斯坦人和其它人所希望的那样手握重权。	Palestinians will have to decide whether to make the position of PNA president a powerful one or merely symbolic, as it now is. The latter option would make Qurei an empowered prime minister, which is what many Palestinians and others want.
相比之下，政府就算大肆隐瞒实际经济状况或者操纵审计也不会受到任何惩罚 — — 正如我们在希腊政府身上看到的那样。	By contrast, governments pay no penalties for outrageous misrepresentation or fraudulent accounting, as the Greek debacle shows.
而根据BIS的数据，尽管人民币终于进入了外汇市场前十名，但只占全部交易的2.2 % ， 还不如墨西哥比索的2.5 % 。	And, according to the BIS, while the renminbi has finally broken into the top ten currencies in foreign-exchange markets, it still accounts for only 2.2% of all transactions, just behind the Mexican peso’s 2.5% share.
纽黑文－在我们揣摩中国5860亿美元经济刺激计划的含义时，思考中国为什么每次在需要促进经济增长的时候，都选择基础设施建设、房屋以及大项目，是很有趣的。	NEW HAVEN – As we digest the implications of China’s $586 billion stimulus plan, it is intriguing to ponder why China chooses infrastructure, buildings, and big projects every time growth needs a boost.
但倘若要二者选其一：一是作为一个任由系统崩溃的中央银行官员遗臭万年，二是在给那些风险玩家一个教训之后收获不知何时降临的善果，估计很多中央银行家的答案都无法预测。	When asked to choose between the risk of being known to posterity as the central banker who let the system collapse and the intangible future benefits of teaching risk takers a lesson, it does not take genius to predict the central banker’s decision.
我与开放社会基金会共同编辑的一份 2014年未来数字新闻报告认为，政府利用财政压力来操纵审查对象国超过半数的新闻媒体。	According to a 2014 report on the future of digital journalism, which I co-edited for the Open Society Foundations, governments used financial pressure to manipulate news organizations in more than half of the markets we examined.
总理伦齐政府政局不稳，经济增长萎靡不振，银行急需资本，而若要实现欧盟财政目标，难免将引发又一场衰退。	Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s government has become politically shakier, economic growth is anemic, the banks are in need of capital, and EU fiscal targets will be hard to achieve without triggering another recession.
纽约 — — 自从10年前西非地区的残酷内战结束后，现在的埃博拉疫情夺走生命、摧毁社区、催生孤儿的速度可谓史无前例。	NEW YORK – The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is destroying lives, decimating communities, and orphaning children at a rate not seen since the region’s brutal civil wars ended more than a decade ago.
他尽可能地少花时间到加沙，更乐意在其位于约旦河西岸拉马拉的办公室会见来访的政客并在此或出国会见世界政要。	He spent as little time as he could there, preferring his Ramallah office on the West Bank and spending time with visiting politicians and meeting world leaders there or abroad.
这些新治理安排具有重要的增强恢复力的效果；但是它们也许无法提供多边主义的更高效的替代方案，并且它们也确实没有消除传统多边机构的必要性。	These new governance arrangements have important resilience-enhancing effects; but they may not offer a more efficient alternative to multilateralism, and they do not eliminate the need for traditional multilateral institutions.
但尽管美联储实施积极货币宽松的许诺非常引人注目，但此举对实体经济和美股的影响可能比前两轮的都要更小也更短暂。	But, despite the Fed’s impressive commitment to aggressive monetary easing, its effects on the real economy and on US equities could well be smaller and more fleeting than those of previous QE rounds.
结果英国本土的外国劳工数量自1993年以来翻了一番，达到600余万，相当于总劳动力的10 ％ ， 如今大部分都来自非欧盟其他原始成员国的低工资国家。	As a result, the number of foreign-born workers in Britain has doubled since 1993, to more than six million, or 10% of the labor force, with most now coming from low-wage countries that were not among the EU’s other original members.
如果土耳其不再向欧洲靠近，那么欧盟关于它在世界政治中成功���运用了“软实力”的说法必将被大打折扣。	If Turkey pulls away from Europe, the EU’s claim that it successfully wields “soft power” in world politics will be powerfully undermined.
法蒂玛和阿巴斯王朝之战、十字军东征、蒙古人入侵、奥斯曼帝国的政府，当然还有西方帝国主义，都是今天的斗争的参照点。	The battles between the Fatimids and the Abbasids, the Crusades, the Mongol invasion, the Ottoman conquest, and, of course, Western imperialism all serve as points of reference for today’s struggles.
一旦税收立法讨论完毕 — — 特别是如果它向今年早些时候的共和党的医疗改革方案那样遭到耻辱性失败 — — 特朗普将会在贸易问题上表现出要言行一致的样子。	Once tax legislation is off the table – and especially if it fails ignominiously in the same manner as the Republicans’ health-care-reform effort earlier this year – Trump will want to show that he means what he has said on trade.
2013年，IMF承认其分析师知道希腊债务不可持续，但仍决定按原计划行事 ， “ 因为害怕希腊的溢出效应威胁欧元区和全球经济 ” 。	"In 2013, the Fund admitted that its analysts knew that Greece's debt was not sustainable, but decided to go ahead with the program “because of the fear that spillovers from Greece would threaten the euro area and the global economy."""
然而莫迪没有做出任何表示平息支持者或安抚批评者，这让投资者 — — 特别是外国投资者 — — 担心他是否有能力管好自己的选民。	Yet Modi has said nothing to quiet his supporters or mollify his critics, raising concerns among investors – especially foreigners – about his ability to manage his own constituents.
提奥巴德（Robert Theobald）的预测亦然 — — 在其1963年的著作《自由的人和自由市场 》 （ Free Men and Free Markets ） ， 他质疑了公众对高失业的厌恶之情。	So was Robert Theobald, who, in his 1963 book Free Men and Free Markets questioned the public’s repugnance toward high unemployment.
这已成为根深蒂固的持续模式，包括在我担任IMF首席经济学家期间（2007年初至2008年8月 ） 。	This has been the entrenched and continuing pattern, including when I was the IMF’s chief economist (from early 2007 to August 2008).
巴勒斯坦人必须承认的现实情况包括他们面对以色列和美国在战略、政治和经济上的不平衡，被占领的事实和颠沛流离的生活所带来的挑战。	The current realities that the Palestinians must reckon with include their strategic, political, and economic imbalance vis-à-vis Israel and the US, the reality of occupation, and the challenges of diaspora life.
通过在1981年以后实行限制自由的“紧急状态法 ” ， 建立严格的审查制度和操纵选举，埃及的政府像对待奴隶一样压制埃及的国民。	By using the “emergency law,” which has restricted freedom since 1981, together with censorship and rigged elections, Egypt’s government treats its citizens like serfs.
财政部长莱谢克•巴尔采罗维奇领导下快速而意义深远的私有化及市场改革是马佐维耶茨基团队最伟大的成就之一。	One of the Mazowiecki team’s greatest achievements was the introduction, led by Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, of fast and far-reaching market reforms and privatization.
保险资讯中心（Insurance Information Institute）的一份研究表明，与美国5.23%的比例相比，2003年印度尼西亚财产保险支出仅占全国GDP的0.83 % ， 泰国为1.19 % ， 印度为0.62 % 。	According to a study by the Insurance Information Institute, expenditures on non-life insurance in 2003 amounted to only 0.83% of GDP in Indonesia, 1.19% of GDP in Thailand, and 0.62% of GDP in India, compared with 5.23% of GDP in the United States.
事实上，世卫组织已经宣布使用实验性血清Zmapp合乎伦理 — — 这是一组混合基因工程抗体，旨在协助患者对抗埃博拉病毒。	In fact, the World Health Organization has already pronounced the use of the experimental serum ZMapp – a mixture of genetically engineered antibodies intended to help patients fight the disease – ethical.
斯堪的那维亚国家的成功除了内含的会计把戏外，高政府就业份额还可能对解决西方经济体所面临的最为基本的问题之一作出实际的贡献。	Apart from the accounting trick implicit in Scandinavia’s success, the high share of government in employment may also make a real contribution to solving one of the most fundamental problems western economies now face.
事实上，中国在努力使自己成为贸易大动脉的主宰者，同时煽动与不少邻国的领土和领海纠纷，以此改变亚洲的地缘政治版图。	Indeed, by working to establish its dominance along major trade arteries, while instigating territorial and maritime disputes with several neighbors, China is attempting to redraw Asia's geopolitical map.
但是，尽管两国在2010年签订了防务和安全合作条约，英国人仍借口预算问题采购与法国航母不兼容的战斗机。	But, despite the two countries’ 2010 treaty on defense and security cooperation, the British have decided, for budgetary reasons, to acquire aircraft that will not be compatible with French aircraft carriers.
如IPCC这样的全球科学程序是至关重要的，因为它们在最大程度上给了我们期望，那就是在科学证据的基础上铸造共识。	Global scientific processes like the IPCC are critical, because they offer our best hope of forging a consensus based on the scientific evidence.
但中国所支持的项目通常不是为了支持本地经济，而是为了便利中国获得自然资源，或为低成本的劣质中国商品打开市场。	But the projects that China is supporting are often intended not to support the local economy, but to facilitate Chinese access to natural resources, or to open the market for its low-cost and shoddy export goods.
《里斯本条约》是欧盟领导人在检讨了2005年在法国和荷兰公投中遭遇滑铁卢的《欧盟宪法条约》之后的妥协产物。	The Lisbon Treaty was the compromise agreed by EU leaders in the aftermath of the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in popular referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005.
发自达拉漠 — — 在遭受了警方的殴打和羞辱之后，念过大学的突尼斯菜贩默罕默德·博阿茲茲点火自焚，并随之掀起了席卷整个阿拉伯世界的示威浪潮。	DURHAM – In setting himself ablaze following a humiliating encounter with the police, the university-educated Tunisian vegetable seller Mohamed Bouazizi triggered a wave of protests across the Arab world.

即使有些机构将碳密集型企业清除出了自身投资组合，它们也会普遍认为投资新清洁能源基础设施项目（尤其是在新兴市场）风险过高。	Even as some purge their portfolios of carbon-intensive companies, they generally consider investing in new clean-energy infrastructure projects to be too risky, particularly in emerging markets.
当今世界的许多问题都可以追溯到能源应用领域，从石油供应引发的冲突、温室气体排放引发的担忧到因电力短缺或停电造成的生产率和产量损失。	Many of the world’s problems today can be traced to energy use, from conflicts over oil supplies and concerns about greenhouse-gas emissions to lost productivity and output stemming from shortages and blackouts.
之后，在2016年，俄罗斯军事情报部门进一步黑进民主党全国委员会的专用网络盗取信息，并将所盗取的信息在线发布以破坏希拉里·克林顿竞选总统。	Then, in 2016, Russian military intelligence went a step further, by hacking into the private network of the Democratic National Committee, stealing information, and releasing it online to damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy.
今年，美国国家卫生研究所（National Institutes of Health，NIH，世界领先的医学研究中心）的资金比2012年减少了十亿美元。	This year, funding for the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) – one of the world’s leading medical research centers – is a billion dollars lower than in 2012.
2009年是罕见的例外；雷曼兄弟破产所造成的冲击是突发事件，具有极大的消极影响，并且高度对称，几十年才会遇到一次。	What happened in 2009 was a rare exception; shocks like that which followed the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy – sudden, strongly adverse, and highly symmetric – come once in decades.
很多领导人都并非传统的原教旨主义者，而是在全球化浪潮中被连根拔起并且在想象中的纯伊斯��哈里发团体中寻找生存意义的民众。	Many of the leaders are not traditional fundamentalists, but people whose identity has been uprooted by globalization and who are searching for meaning in the imagined community of a pure Islamic caliphate.
而正是这个多元化的团体使得一个正日益显现的全球性共识明晰起来。 这便是：虽然全球化有着积极的潜力，但它并没有发挥出这种潜力，还造成了社会的困境。	Yet this very heterogeneous group was able to crystallize the emerging global consensus that globalization, despite its positive potential, has not only failed to live up to that potential, but has actually contributed to social distress.
相反，他的团队构造了一个复杂而离奇的幻想 — — 它建立在几十年来共和党财政不负责任的基础上并远远过之。	Instead, his team has constructed an elaborate and rather bizarre fantasy – building upon but also going far beyond several decades of Republican fiscal irresponsibility.
在一个大布告板上孤零零地贴着一张求职意向书，上面写着“年轻女性，性格温和无不良嗜好，愿意承担水泥销售工作 ” 。	A forlorn job application on a large signpost reads, “Nice girl, gentle without bad habits, will sell cement.”
这些转移支付资金导致成千上万依赖捕鱼为生的社会难以与获得补贴的对手竞争，而工业化远洋捕捞耗尽了海洋资源，让数百万人的食品安全受到威胁。	These transfers leave thousands of fishing-dependent communities struggling to compete with subsidized rivals and threaten the food security of millions of people as industrial fleets from distant lands deplete their oceanic stocks.
欧洲领导人正在思考应对措施，他们的下一步动作将决定欧洲的命运 — — 要么让市场恢复平静，要么把市场推向新的极端。	Europe’s leaders are now contemplating what to do, and their next move will have fateful consequences, either calming the markets or driving them to new extremes.
我怀疑后一种情况将成为现实，因为在欧洲大部分地区以及美国，失业问题和公共开支的削减将使经济方面的信心难以得到提振；而这又会导致解决全球失衡这一政治任务变得愈加棘手。	I suspect the latter, with unemployment and cuts in public spending – certainly in much of Europe and the United States – constraining economic confidence. That will make the politics of dealing with global imbalances all the more difficult.
但是，总的来说，美国军队中的男男女女都相信这个理想，并竭力以此作为生活准则，一如美国公民总的来说相信宪法的崇高字句并试图纠正祖国的短处。	But, by and large, the men and women of the US military believe in these ideals and do their best to live up to them, just as US citizens generally believe in their Constitution’s lofty words and seek to correct their national shortcomings.
如果当时西方就准备满足于事实遏制伊朗的核计划，而不是毁掉其核计划中所有的敏感成分，那么当时就有可能达成协议。	If, at that time, the West had been prepared to settle for effectively containing Iran’s nuclear program, rather than destroying every last sensitive component of it, a deal would have been possible.
卡钦斯基的反图斯克运动是特朗普式政治权力的滥用，它预示了如果特朗普真的当选，他的政治对手命运会如何。	Kaczyński’s anti-Tusk crusade is a Trump-worthy abuse of political power that foreshadows what life would be like for Trump’s political opponents if he were actually to win.
欧洲人认为，美国在伊拉克的军事冒险首先提高了石油价格，所以就应当用能源税来平抑油价。 人们可以原谅他们这样的想法。	Europeans might be forgiven for thinking that the Americans, who pumped up oil prices in the first place with their military misadventure in Iraq, should be the ones who “pump it down” with an energy tax.
但是正如科幻作家长期以来一直警告我们的那样，硅基“生命”形式诞生所带来的潜在威胁才是真正值得害怕的。	But as science fiction writers have long warned us, the potential threats arising from the birth of silicon-based “life” forms are truly frightening.
但他相当技术性的讨论（集中于货币经济学和金本位）并未在经济学家间构成新共识，新闻媒体也完全没有警告萧条的报道。	But his rather technical discussion (which focused on monetary economics and the gold standard) forged no new consensus among economists, and the news media reported no clear sense of alarm.
特别是要专门针对俄罗斯去制定一个更为成熟严密的政策：比如说当我们对俄罗斯试图重建前苏联“利益圈”和“防御区”的政策感到不满时，中欧人就应该把自己定义为俄罗斯人的对手。	For example, we Central Europeans are opponents when we do not accept Russia’s policy of renewing “spheres of interest” and “security zones.”
特别是在赫尔穆特·科尔（Helmut Kohl）总理带领下的德国通常将货币一体化与政治联盟的目的联系在一起。	In particular, Germany under Chancellor Helmut Kohl often linked monetary integration with the objective of political union.
"“我们不要妖魔化煤炭 ， "" 煤炭业盟友之一、澳大利亚总理阿伯特 如是说 ， “ 煤炭对人类有好处 。 """	"“Let's have no demonization of coal,"" as one ally, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, put it. “Coal is good for humanity."""
如果美国的防务创新继续节节败退，不但美国国防能力要蒙受损失，还有可能在商业创新和竞争力等方面也有所滑落。	If US defense innovation continues to erode, not only will America’s defense capabilities suffer; the country will also risk slipping in terms of commercial innovation and competitiveness.
毕竟，据报他根本无法吸收全面、有组织的政策简报，而他的意见总是与最后一位与他交谈者的意见有许多相似之处。	After all, he is reportedly unable to absorb comprehensive, organized policy briefings, and his opinions tend to reflect those of whomever he spoke to last.
欧洲应该与伊朗市民社会站在一起，欧洲议会已经高度赞扬了伊朗人民为捍卫基本自由和民主原则而奋斗的勇气。	Europe should stand with Iran's civil society, and the European Parliament has already paid tribute to the courage of all those Iranian men and women who are defending their basic freedoms and democratic principles.
政府的一些改革派希望更多采取德国式的学徒制；也有言论认为应该为小企业提供税收优惠，或者放松过度限制的监管。	Some reformers in government want more German-style apprenticeship schemes; there is talk of tax breaks for small businesses, and of easing excessively intrusive regulatory burdens.
成本的绝大部分来自开始阶段，产生于硬件（如传感器）设计以及（更重要的）开发有能力处理各种任务的软件的过程中。	The vast majority of the cost comes at the start, in the design of hardware (like sensors) and, more important, in creating the software that produces the capability to carry out various tasks.
所有人都不愿挑战美国的金融霸权，或者放弃特朗普对近5，000家德国企业提出的总额高达6，000亿美元的减税计划。	All were unwilling to challenge US financial might or to forfeit the tax cuts Trump had delivered to almost 5,000 German companies with a combined balance sheet of $600 billion.
对最昂贵项目 — — 实施绿色能源体系、建设交通基础设施以及开发现代城市 — — 的融资必须来自外国机构投资者。	Financing for the most expensive projects – implementing green-energy systems, building transport infrastructure, and developing modern cities – must come from foreign institutional investors.
如果非洲的未来将由被这一挑战伤害最深的人所决定或影响，那么尼日利亚教育计划和加纳教育计划等项目就是至关重要的。	If the future of the continent is to be shaped by, or with, those who have most acutely experienced its challenges, programs like Teach for Nigeria and Teach for Ghana are essential.
寡头集团为把持石油收入而斗争，民粹主义者承诺重新分配石油收入，两大集团都竭尽所能为自己攫取最大的好处。	Oligarchs fight to keep control over the oil revenues, populists promise to redistribute them, and both groups steal as much as they can for themselves.
即使我们可以原谅布什将美国（以及世界大部分国家）拖入了没有对手的战争，原谅他在战争成本上的不诚实，他为战争融资的办法也找不到任何开脱的理由。	Even if Bush could be forgiven for taking America, and much of the rest of the world, to war on false pretenses, and for misrepresenting the cost of the venture, there is no excuse for how he chose to finance it.
但只要天然气输送一天掌握在被身份不明者控制的秘密公司手里，乌克兰的能源需求，乃至整个欧洲的能源供应就永远没有安全可言。	Ukraine’s energy needs, and thus the certainty of energy supplies across Europe, will never be secure as long as gas transit is in the hands of secretive companies with unknown owners.
科恩的罪名是让公众知道了他几乎因为上个月在弗吉尼亚州夏洛特维尔（Charlottesville）的暴力而辞职。 在该事件中，特朗普将白人至上主义者和新纳粹示威者（他们中不少持有武装 ） ， 与反对他们的人相提并论。	Cohn’s sin was to let it be known publicly that he almost resigned following the violence last month in Charlottesville, Va., when Trump equated white supremacist and neo-Nazi demonstrators, many of them armed, with those who opposed them.
如果那个孩子遗传了这种基因，那么他/她就会在40岁左右发病，导致动作不受控制，性格突变以及缓慢的认知能力衰退。	If the child does inherit it, he or she will, at around 40, begin to suffer uncontrollable movements, personality changes, and a slow deterioration of cognitive capacities.
美国在欧洲的军事部署将逐渐减弱，其领导国际危机干预的意愿亦然 — — 即使是对于影响欧洲利益的危机也是如此。	America’s military presence in Europe will be gradually reduced, as will its willingness to take the lead in international crises – even those affecting Europe’s interests.
由于SDG投资规模有限，ODA必须合理配置以吸引更多融资，或通过混合融资（公私合作）机制引导现有资源。	Owing to limited investment in the SDGs, ODA must be deployed in such a way that it attracts additional financing, or channels existing resources through blended-finance (public-private) mechanisms.
台湾唯一的原住民国会议员曾经对陈水扁和民进党进行了一次逻辑上的驳斥，此人在一次国会会议上专门用自己的方言发表了一通演讲，结果没有一个与会议员听得懂。	Taiwan ’s sole aboriginal parliamentarian once provided the logical rebuttal to Chen and the DPP, delivering a speech to a packed Congress entirely in his native tongue, which nobody else in the chamber could understand.
Jan Dhan Yojana是高优先级的印度联邦政府计划，为穷人提供银行服务，并在不到两年内促成开立了2.5亿个新银行账户。	Jan Dhan Yojana, a high-priority Indian federal-government program that provides access to the banking sector for the poor, has enabled 250 million new bank accounts to be opened in less than two years.
政策制定者们应当抛弃繁杂的碳减排谈判，取而代之的则是达成协定，共同投资研究和改进技术，使之达到一个可供有效利用的水平。	Policymakers should abandon fraught carbon-reduction negotiations, and instead make agreements to invest in research and development to get this technology to the level where it needs to be.
学校和师资力量的短缺使得学校班级规模达到了50—60人，每天的在校时间也被压缩到了几个小时，以便让两批甚至三批学生轮流上课。	Shortages of schools and teachers have pushed class sizes to 50 or 60, and the school day is restricted to a few hours to allow for two or even three shifts.
但是，一些观察者 — — 而不仅仅是一贯的悲观派 — — 反驳说证据仍然只是偶然的，无法预测当前经济状况会持续多久。	Still, some observers – and not just chronic pessimists – have countered that the evidence remains anecdotal, and that it is impossible to predict how long the current economic moment will last.
但祖玛认为，这样的结果并没有实现1981年时任非国大总统奥利佛·坦博所设定的目标，坦博总统曾试图通过“将国家财富归还给全体民众”来实现经济解放。	But, Zuma argues, the outcomes fall short of the goal set in 1981 by the ANC’s then-president, Oliver Tambo, who sought to achieve economic emancipation, through “a return [sic] of the wealth of the country to the people as a whole.”
报告作者之一的帕斯卡尔·雷米（Pascal Lemy）曾被选为世界贸易组织总干事，当时，对于他要担任的岗位，甚至连可用于衡量他的资质的岗位描述都没有。	When Pascal Lamy, one of the authors of the report, was chosen to become head of the World Trade Organization, there was not even a description of the job against which his qualifications could be measured.
因此，即使大坝能够满足发电目标，也有可能无法实现其他水管理目标 — — 如控制洪水、航船和储水等 — — 的最大化长期价值。	As a result, even dams that meet their power-generation goals may fail to maximize the long-term value of other water-management services such as flood control, navigation, and water storage.
在最近十年较好的阶段，即我们开始意识到债务驱动的过度扩张迟早会结束时，该指数就一直在下跌，最近的债务危机则加速了下跌。	The decline occurred over the better part of a decade, as we began to see the end of debt-driven overexpansion, and accelerated with the latest debt crisis.
鉴于朝鲜对中国的经济依赖 — — 中朝贸易现在占朝鲜贸易量的90 % — —美国一定要利用这种政策趋同的优势。	Given North Korea’s economic dependence on China – which accounts for some 90% of its trade nowadays – it is critical to take advantage of this policy convergence.
一个大部分人仍然相信占星家的国家可以很好地欣赏一场由下得不是时候的倾盆大雨，一个准备不好的击球，一个不准的投球，或者接球手眼中的光线都可以改变比赛结果的体育运动。	A country where a majority of the population still consults astrologers can well appreciate a sport in which an ill-timed cloudburst, a badly prepared pitch, a lost toss, or the sun in the eyes of a fielder can transform a game’s outcome.
在为推迟联合国停火协议四处游说的同时，布什和赖斯翻来覆去地强调必须通过一项安理会决议，用武力来应对“问题的根源 ” 。	In the course of maneuvering to delay the UN ceasefire, Bush and Rice continually reiterated the need for a Security Council resolution that deals forcefully with “the roots of the problem.”
经业内审议二氧化碳损失的最大估计值为5美元每吨，也就是说太阳能和风能发电每耗费1美元避免了约0.03美元的气候损失。	The biggest peer-reviewed estimate of the damage cost of CO2 is about $5 per ton. This means that solar and wind power avoid about $0.03 of climate damage for every dollar spent.
或许是出于这一原因，许多组织，包括某些最有名的在非洲工作的扶贫组织并没有对善举提出的信息要求做出回应。	Perhaps for this reason, many organizations, including some of the best-known anti-poverty organizations working in Africa, did not respond to GiveWell’s request for information.
经济学家杰弗里·弗兰克尔（Jeffrey Frankel）将货币操纵称为“喀迈拉 ” （ chimera ） ， 认为“将阻止货币操纵的措施与贸易协定挂钩过去一直是、现在也是坏主意 。 ”	The economist Jeffrey Frankel has called currency manipulation a chimera, declaring that “linking efforts to prevent currency manipulation to trade agreements has always been a bad idea, and it still is.”
与此同时，因为对包括颇受欢迎的篮球明星勒布朗·詹姆斯在内的批评者发起人身攻击，唐纳德·特朗普总统可能正在损害其本人及其政党的选举前景，尤其是在郊区妇女群体当中。	At the same time, President Donald Trump may be hurting his and his party’s electoral prospects, especially among suburban women, by launching personal attacks against those who criticize him – including the popular basketball star LeBron James.
这意味着从2010年伊始就开始上调基准政策利率13倍以应对依然严重的通胀局面的印度储备银行很难切实放松货币政策。	That means that the Reserve Bank of India – which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still-serious inflation problem – can ill afford to ease monetary policy.
首先，如果美国的初衷是破坏伊拉克稳定，那恐怕这一目标已经完美实现：10年后，伊拉克能否作为统一国家存在都充满了变数。	For starters, if the US had set out to destabilize Iraq, its efforts could hardly have been more successful: ten years later, the country’s viability as a single state has never been in greater doubt.
许多左倾辩论家拿出日本的例子 — — 日本债务目前大约为GDP的140 % — —来论证大幅增加债务是一个好主意，丝毫不顾日本萎靡的增长纪录。	Many left-leaning polemicists point to Japan, where net debt is about 140% of GDP, as proof that much higher debt is a great idea, despite the country’s anemic growth record.
新加坡总理李光耀和马来西亚首相马哈蒂尔· 穆罕默德（Mahathir Mohamed）退出政治第一线后，东南亚失去了资深领导人。	The retirements from frontline politics of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew and Malaysia’s Mahathir Mohamed have deprived Southeast Asia of its senior leaders.
但是，尽管美国总统奥巴马将四方决定作为其在以巴冲突问题上的外交指导原则，但以巴局势并没有因此得到进展，因为在诸多细节上根本无法达成一致。	And yet, while US President Barack Obama has referred to the quartet’s decision as his guiding principle for diplomatic action on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the situation remains as dire as ever, because the devil remains in the details.
在不可贸易部门（占发达国家经济的60—70 % ） ，主要增长拖累因素是疲软的需求（比如金融危机后的美国）以及因结构性和竞争阻碍了生产率发展（如日本 ） 。	In the non-tradable sector (60-70% of the economy in advanced countries), the main growth inhibitors are weak demand, as in the United States following the financial crisis, and structural and competitive impediments to productivity, as in Japan.
由于发达经济体的不可贸易部门可以创造更多的就业，因此这一模式可能导致就业问题（即使这可以通过削减工时而非岗位而得到部分掩盖 ） 。	Because the non-tradable sector in advanced economies tends to create more jobs, this model can lead to an employment problem (even if it is partly masked by cutting hours rather than workers).
对印度妇女来说，最大的交通障碍是规划者所谓的第一和最后一英里问题 — — 从家中/工作单位到车站的距离，阿莎对此有切肤之痛。	The biggest transportation roadblock for women in India lies in what planners call the first-last mile problem – getting to and from the station, a concern that Astha knows well.
但美国财政部和美国贸易代表坚决拒绝将禁止货币操纵纳入TPP中，他们提出了五个主要理由，但没有一个与事实相符。	Yet the US Treasury Department and the US Trade Representative steadfastly refuse to include any language prohibiting currency manipulation in the TPP, for five main reasons – none of which fits the facts.
当利物浦和曼彻斯特铁路线终于在1830年开通时，它带来了一场革命性的胜利，不仅开启了蒸汽时代，而且以人们从未预见的方式改变了世界。	When the L&M Railway eventually opened in 1830, it was a revolutionary success, kickstarting the age of steam and changing the world in ways that could not have been foreseen.
而且随着中国共产党第十九次全国代表大会在今年晚些时候召开，中国主席习近平不愿被外界视为对美国的压力屈服。	And with the Communist Party of China’s 19th National Congress looming later this year, President Xi Jinping will not want to be perceived as giving in to US pressure.
在这一努力中，美国新任总统以多快的速度回应阿拉伯－以色列冲突，对欧洲来说是至关重要的。 因为对欧洲来说，耶路撒冷一直比巴格达更加重要，但是，乔治·沃克·布什却拒绝听取这一点。	How fast America’s new president addresses the Arab-Israeli conflict will be of paramount concern to Europeans in this effort. For to them, Jerusalem has always mattered more than Baghdad, but George W. Bush refused to listen.
一个单一、同质的人民，他们不会犯错，只需要一个真正的代表来合适地实施他们的意愿，这是一个幻想 — — 但这个幻想可以应对实际问题。	A single, homogeneous people who can do no wrong and need only a genuine representative to implement their will properly is a fantasy – but it is a fantasy that can respond to real problems.
当它产生严重且系统性失败时，不管是在战场上 — — 正如1940年在法国 — — 还是在公司董事会或工厂车间，它的受欢迎程度都会迅速衰落。	Its popularity can ebb quickly when it becomes associated with crippling and systemic failure, whether on the battlefield – as in France in 1940 – or in the corporate boardroom and on the factory floor.
美国总统布什启动了一个帮助15个非洲国家控制疟疾的新计划，并史无前例地在12月主持了一场白宫峰会以争取私营部门的支持。	US President George W. Bush has launched an important new initiative to help 15 African countries to control malaria, and hosted an unprecedented White House summit in December to rally private-sector support.
21世纪最初几年中，中国存在巨额经常项目盈余，累积了庞大的外汇储备存量 — — 包括至少数万亿美元的美国国债。	China ran a very large current-account surplus during the early 2000s and accumulated a vast stock of foreign reserves – including at least several trillion dollars’ worth of US Treasury debt.
“美国就业机会法案”约占GDP总额的3 % ， 预定于2012年生效。 该法案将在全球经济环境不利的情况下及时推动就业，为美国的经济复苏保驾护航。	The AJA amounted to about 3% of GDP and was designed to take effect in 2012, providing a timely employment boost and insurance for the US recovery against global headwinds.
尽管目前外国人持有着大约一半的美国政府债务，但最新报告表明，外国买家在不断减少，国内投资者购买了全部新发政府债务。	Although foreigners now own about 50% of US government debt, recent reports indicate that foreign buyers are remaining on the sidelines and domestic investors are currently buying all of the new government debt.
然而该国花了18年的时间来迷惑监督机构“国际原子能组织”派出的调查员，以致有的国家认为伊朗已经自毁信誉，放弃了在本国土地上发展铀浓缩的权利。	But it spent 18 years deceiving inspectors from the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency, leading some countries to argue that Iran destroyed its credibility and forfeited its rights to enrichment on its own soil.
此外，美国总统奥巴马面临着11月的选举，不希望被指责对伊朗采取姑息态度，因此西方国家很难对伊朗伸出援手。	Moreover, US President Barack Obama, facing an election in November, does not wish to be accused of being soft on Iran, making it difficult for the West to reciprocate potential Iranian overtures.
最近与日本签署的自贸协定将导致欧盟在农业领域对美国取得明显的优势，而随着美国重新谈判北美自由贸易协定，加强与墨西哥的贸易关系也有可能产生类似的影响。	The free-trade agreement recently signed with Japan will give the EU a clear advantage over the US in agriculture, and strengthening trade ties with Mexico could have a similar impact, as the US renegotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement.
如果金融传染病程度有限，希腊是唯一的受害者，那么欧元区产出尽管将受严重打击，但不至于出现灾难性后果。	Should contagion prove to be limited, with Greece the only casualty, the drop in eurozone output may be severe, but not catastrophic.
但是缅甸的表现令人大失所望，东盟也是如此，尽管它们在拖了很久后终于开始投入救援，期望能在恶劣的环境下做出最大的努力。	Burma failed miserably, and, despite belated efforts to make the best of terrible circumstances, so has ASEAN.
美国此次行动完全符合联合国大会2005年一致通过的保护平民免遭大规模暴行的国际责任原则（R2P ） 。	The United States’ action is completely consistent with the principles of the international responsibility to protect (R2P) people at risk of mass-atrocity crimes, which was embraced unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly in 2005.
1月初，美国社会批评家霍华德·昆斯勒（Howard Kunstler）将印度描述为“一只脚踏进了现代世界，另一只脚还在多彩的幻想世界中徜徉的国家 ” 。	In early January, the American social critic James Howard Kunstler described India as “a nation with one foot in the modern age and the other in a colorful hallucinatory dreamtime.”
由于慈善捐款只有在捐赠者获得的附带价值不超过其捐赠额时才可在联邦一级抵扣税，而上述州法案安排显然不属于这种情况。	Charitable contributions are deductible at the federal level only if the donor receives no more than incidental value for the contribution, which obviously wouldn’t be the case in this situation.
虽然衡量教育方面的成效(尤其是在多种情况下)可能比较困难，同伴行动网络必须以取得成果为导向，而这意味着要对其效果进行衡量。	While gauging success in education can be difficult, especially across contexts, peer action networks must be oriented toward achieving results, and that means measuring their effectiveness.
中国和印度在美国都有庞大的海外社区，中国为240万，印度为170万。 和其他美国人一样，他们对于各自的祖国越发关注。	Large expatriate communities in the US – 2.4 million Chinese and 1.7 million Indians – have increased interest in their home countries among other Americans.
地震给了它们一个机会来展示自己，而且，前所未有的人有了机会把这一新生的民间社会看作是一个符合他们利益的积极力量。	The quake gave them an opportunity to be seen, and an unprecedented number of people had a chance to perceive this nascent civil society as a positive force that serves their own interests.
事实上，中国年经济增长率自2012年以来一直徘徊在7.5%左右，今年预计将下降到7 % ， 并且有可能继续降低。	Indeed, the annual growth rate, which has been lingering at about 7.5% since 2012, is predicted to fall to 7% this year – and is likely to go lower.
由此引出的问题是，当中国和世界其他国家能够全身而退，而特朗普的关税政策却开始伤害美国企业和选民时他将作何反响。	This raises the question of how Trump will react when his tariffs start to hurt US businesses and voters, while China and the rest of the world shrug them off.
在伊朗之前，美国拒绝轰炸叙利亚（沙特在中东地区的另一大对手 ） ， 还在2011年祝福了前埃及总统穆巴拉克的下台（沙特的重要盟友 ） 。	The falling out over Iran follows America’s refusal to bomb Syria (another Saudi rival in the region) and its blessing of the removal in 2011 of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (an important Saudi ally).
根据国家教育规划与管理研究所2005年发布的一份报告，印度8.1%的小学没有教室，17.5%的小学仅有一名教师。	According to a report released by the National Institute for Educational Planning Administration (NIEPA) in 2005, 8.1% of primary schools in India have no classrooms, while 17.5% have only one teacher.
埃塞俄比亚也面临着几十年来最严重的干旱，导致许多农作物歉收、由此造成的粮食短缺威胁着该国1/10左右的人口。	Ethiopia is also dealing with its worst drought in decades, which has already contributed to the failure of many crops, creating food shortages that now affect around a tenth of the population.
理查德·怀斯曼是英国赫特福德大学的心理学教授，他跟踪调查了 5000 名制定了新年计划的人，发现只有大约 1/10 的人能把自己的计划坚持了下来。	Richard Wiseman, a professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, has tracked 5,000 people who made New Year’s resolutions. Only about one in ten managed to stick to what they had resolved.
没错，法国已经全面禁止了优步的汽车服务，虽然后者无疑是近十年来最具革命性且最有重大进步意义的商业模式。	Yes, France has sought to limit the car service Uber, whose business model has arguably been one of the most transformative and important advances of the decade.
2008年，在国会听证上，格林斯潘愿意承认他的思想中存在致命漏洞，即去监管化的金融市场运行得实在糟糕。	By 2008, in congressional testimony, Greenspan was willing to concede a fatal flaw in his thinking – deregulated financial markets can indeed go badly wrong.
例如，2007—2008年全球金融危机就暴露了发达经济体中的腐败，既得利益集团为了确保他们的利益，乘机巩固了他们在立法和监管方面的影响力。	Consider the kind of corruption in advanced economies exposed by the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, in which vested interests secure the enactment of laws and regulations that entrench their own advantages.
我一直怀抱着这份提案在与英国的一些相关利益相关方接触，包括凯文·霍林拉克（Kevin Hollinrake）等有志于此的议员以及卫生部和英国制药业协会的相关人员。	With this proposal in mind, I have been meeting with a number of relevant stakeholders in the UK, including committed MPs such as Kevin Hollinrake and officials at the Department of Health and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.
檀香山—有一项正在进行中的犬儒主义运动，宣扬在物种保护中使用一种叫做“基因驱动器”的强大但问题重重的新技术。	HONOLULU – A cynical move is underway to promote a new, powerful, and troubling technology known as “gene drives” for use in conservation.
前欧洲央行行长特里谢（Jean-Claude Trichet）早就指出，欧元区无法在没有财政联盟的情况下正常运转。	As former ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has long argued, the eurozone cannot function without a fiscal union.
有勇气的领导人堪称凤毛麟角，而那些信息充分而且富有参与精神的选民也为数不多，因为那些提供给选民的所谓专家意见本身都模棱两可。	Brave leadership is rare. So, too, is an informed and engaged electorate, because the expert advice offered to voters is itself so confusing.
实际上，将金融自由化与城市被列为“金融中心”的特权等同起来恰好放慢了金融自由化的目标，也就是减少政府控制，加快金融市场的发展。	Indeed, equating financial liberalization with privileges for cities designated as “financial centers” undermines the very goals of liberalization – namely, to reduce government control and to accelerate the development of financial markets.
但不管在其他方面的进展如何，只有阿富汗政府有效运作，美国及其盟友才能谈得上胜利 — — 但现在，阿富汗政府正在朝着错误的方向前行。	The United States and its Afghan and NATO allies have demonstrated unmistakable progress in Afghanistan this year.
美国几乎已经完全从针对污染的全球斗争中退缩，而且通过其不加控制的增长巩固了其世界主要污染国家的地位。	The US has almost totally backed away from the global fight against pollution, and, through uncontrolled growth, solidifies its position as the world’s leading polluter.
德国所提出的减税方案 — — 和美国的特朗普减税方案一样 — — 除了带来一些有限的经济收益外，将给长期公共财政造成严重掣肘。	Beyond having only limited economic benefits, the proposed tax cuts in Germany – like Trump’s in the US – represent a huge strain on public finances in the long run.
但转向可再生能源和可持续基础设施将带来相反的影响，有助于遏制温室气体排放，同时增加各国对气候变化的抵御力。	But shifting to renewable energies and sustainable infrastructure can have the opposite impact, helping to mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions while enhancing countries’ resilience to climate change.
因此，从某种程度上说，塔德里的巴基斯坦之行及其强烈的政治激进主义达到了目的：他增强了人民的对他们正在建设的制度的信念。	So, in a way, Qadri’s arrival in Pakistan and his intense political activism have served a purpose: he has reinforced the people’s faith in a system that they are continuing to build.
BJP及其同流者之所以要拔高过去的智慧，是因为他们视之为推进基于信仰的共同身份的核心方法，而这一身份是印度教民族主义的核心。	The BJP and its affiliates exalt the wisdom of the past because they view it as central to the promotion of the faith-based communal identity that the Hindutva project upholds.
除此之外，应该辅之以高负债国家 — — 可��义为债务-GDP之比高于（比如）60%或70%的国家 — — 一定比例负债的共同化和温和减记，替之以长期零息债券。	This should be combined with the mutualization of some portion of the liabilities of highly indebted countries – defined as a debt-to-GDP ratio above, say, 60% or 70% – and modest write-downs in exchange for long-term zero-coupon bonds.
反移民立场转变的惊人速度体现出大多数美国人其实最想要的就是一个合理的手段；他们希望自己的政治领袖能在这一事务上有所担当，而非躲躲藏藏。	The remarkable speed with which anti-immigration positions buckled indicates that what most Americans want, above all, is a rational approach; they want their political leaders to take responsibility for the issue, rather than running away from it.
抑制性的一刀切时监管或许是复杂而不可预测的金融市场的必须，但农村社会与此关系不大，更糟糕的是，这可能扼杀促进金融包容的努力。	Oppressive, blanket regulation, which may be necessary in complex and unpredictable financial markets, may not be relevant in a rural community – or, worse, it may stifle efforts to promote financial inclusion.
十多年的经济衰退导致公共债务不可持续，并正在促使更多移民向美国大陆流动，从而影响到成千上万家庭的生活并加重了留在岛上民众的负担。	More than a decade of recession has made the public debt unsustainable and is fueling migration outflows to the United States mainland, affecting the lives of thousands of families and imposing a higher burden on those who stay.
这一比喻说法来自著名数学家兼计算机科学家阿兰·图灵（Alan Turing ） ， 他和John von Neumann以及其他理论家，发现了所有数学数字和逻辑之间的联系。	The metaphor comes from the famous mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, who, along with John von Neumann and other theoreticians, uncovered the link between the mathematics of whole numbers and logic.
此外，由于煤电和天然气电电厂动辄持续50年或以上，这些投资要么将导致排放量达不到气候目标要求，要么导致重大资产减记。	And, because coal- and gas-fired power stations last 50 years or more, such investments raise the risk of either locking in emission levels incompatible with the climate target, or forcing major asset write-offs.
如果现有银行只是不断变得更大，阻止新竞争者进入市场，它们最终将面临干扰性监管合规措施和更高的资本要求。	If incumbents simply continue to get larger, blocking new competitors from entering the market, they will end up facing intrusive regulatory compliance programs and higher capital requirements.
我们会寻找新的全球合作措施来开发清洁能源系统、药物和疫苗、改善渔业技术、抗旱和温度变化的作物变异体、低耗油的汽车以及低成本的灌溉技术。	Look for new global cooperative approaches to clean energy systems, medicines and vaccines, improved techniques for fish farming, drought-and-temperature resistant crop varieties, high-mileage automobiles, and low-cost irrigation techniques.
这可能产生的影响十分巨大，因为美国对政变毫无规律可循的矛盾反应可能会被理解为对拉美，至少是中美地区其他可能发动政变的领袖的一种沉默的纵容。	Its repercussions could be enormous, because the contradictory and erratic response of the United States to the coup could be interpreted as tacit encouragement for other would-be coup leaders elsewhere in the region, at least in Central America.
鉴于他们自我标榜的正义和历史及文化意识的缺乏，布什及其顾问们相信入侵伊拉克是容易的，并认为萨达姆的武装会溃不成军，而美国会以胜利者的姿态受到欢迎。	Given their self-righteousness and lack of historical and cultural awareness, Bush and his advisors believed that invading Iraq would be easy, that Saddam Hussein’s military would crumble, and that the US would be welcomed as a liberator.
毕竟香港是世界上民众教育程度最高的地方之一：就人均水平而言，这里大概是除曼哈顿以外拥有最多世界前20名大学的毕业生的城市。	After all, Hong Kong has one of the world’s most educated populations: the city has, in per capita terms, perhaps more graduates of the world’s top 20 universities than anywhere outside of Manhattan.
英国，西班牙以及爱尔兰都经历着同样的事情，伴随着住房泡沫的缩小和过度的消费者债务减少零售销售，从而导致衰退的发生。	The UK, Spain, and Ireland are experiencing similar developments, with housing bubbles deflating and excessive consumer debt undercutting retail sales, thus leading to recession.
巴勒斯坦总统阿巴斯联合巴勒斯坦领导层的倡议也许会使哈马斯方面变得更加温和，并且为双方的和解创造真正的前景。	Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ initiative to unite the Palestinian leadership may lead to greater moderation on the part of Hamas and create real prospects for the negotiation of a two-state solution.
这样的转变可能导致工资差距拉大，约13%的工资总额可能转向需要高水平数字技术的非重复性工作，因为上述领域的收入增加。	This shift could contribute to an increase in wage differentials, with around 13% of the total wage bill potentially shifting to non-repetitive jobs requiring high-level digital skills, as incomes in those fields rise.
同样，为了担保2008年9月爱尔兰银行所负的债务，爱尔兰政府做出了一些任何负责任政府都不可能考虑的举动。	Similarly, in guaranteeing the debt of Irish banks in September 2008, the Irish government did something that no responsible government should have contemplated.
但如今，名义GDP增长远远超过长期利率（在一些国家，长期利率包括最多高大100个基点的风险溢价 ） — —即使是欧元区也是如此，那里的名义GDP增长预计今年可达3%左右。	But today, nominal GDP growth far exceeds average long-term interest rates (which, in some countries, include risk premia of up to 100 basis points) – even in the eurozone, where nominal GDP growth is expected to reach about 3% this year.
有希望的研究领域包括充放电次数可达数万次的电网级别电池，以及靠数据分析来优化电池使用，从而尽可能提高电网效率。	Promising areas of research include grid-scale batteries with the ability to charge and discharge tens of thousands of times and data analytics to optimize the use of the batteries and make the grid as efficient as possible.
即便对离岸钻井程序和政策的调整制订已是当务之急，但如果缺乏其他控制需求方面的措施的话，效果就必然是不全面的。	While a regulatory overhaul of offshore drilling procedures and policies is clearly necessary, it will be insufficient to reduce the risk of spills and accidents if it is not accompanied by other demand-side measures.
如今，紧缩支持者用名义债务数字恐吓选民，即使在利率创出历史新低、大量私人部门利润没有被引导进入投资领域的国家也是如此。	Proponents of austerity currently use nominal debt figures to scare voters, even in countries with record-low interest rates and large private-sector profits that are not being channeled toward investment.
最终，人们衡量风险和在充分掌握信息的情况下做出选择的能力对于规管毒品的使用方面非常重要，也有助于体现更为人性化和高效的法律和政策。	At the end of the day, the capacity of people to evaluate risks and make informed choices will be as important to regulating the use of drugs as more humane and efficient laws and policies.
但是哥伦比亚政府注意到，所有的哥伦比亚人都受到反叛者暴力之苦，而工会成员实际上要比国内其他人经���的要少。	Yet the Colombian government notes that all Colombians suffer from rebel violence – union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the population.
我俯瞰着中央公园，想象着半个世纪前在罗马尼亚北部的一个小镇，一位个子很高，头发灰白的人吟诵着自己的诗作 ， “ 红与黑 ” 。 凝视着脚下的公园，那些斯大林主义时代的诗篇从我脑海中闪过：	I am looking down on Central Park and recall from half-a-century ago in a small town in Northern Romania a tall, white-haired man proclaiming his poem, “The Colors Red and Black.” Gazing over the park, I remember those Stalinist era verses:
这些原则没有包括的是如何克服持续和平的最大障碍：没完没了的针对平民的袭击以及恶化最终必须共同执政的叙利亚各派别分歧的暴行。	What they do not include is an effort to address the largest obstacle to lasting peace: the ongoing attacks against civilians and other atrocities that are intensifying divisions among the Syrian factions who will eventually have to govern together.
第一个读出了袋子上文字 ： “ A型血 ” ， 而另一个从档案中读到 ： “ Alexa Holmes，A型血 ” 。	The first read aloud from the bag, “Type A blood,” and the other read aloud from the file, “Alexa Holmes, Type A blood.”
但数据可视化方面的进步、应用研发周期的加快以及技术的稳步消费化正在改变局面，给管理者带来个性化的易于理解的方案。	But advances in data visualization, faster development cycles for applications, and the steady consumerization of technology are changing that, putting customized, easy-to-understand solutions in managers’ hands.
强硬路线在阿富汗、伊拉克、利比亚和叙利亚造成了冲突扩大，导致大量死亡，却没有为受影响国家带来有意义的政治或经济解决方案。	Hardline approaches brought expanded conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, leading to plenty of deaths but not to meaningful political or economic solutions in the affected countries.
如果能实现这一点，美国企业就可以在中国做生意而无须被迫支付如此巨大的竞争代价，而关税的威胁也将成为一个极为有效的贸易政策工具。	If that happens, and US firms can do business in China without being compelled to pay such a steep competitive price, the threat of tariffs will have been a very successful tool of trade policy.
在审读了尼古丁中毒和尝试自杀的案例报告后，药物学家本恩德·梅耶（Bernd Mayer）发现人类尼古丁致死剂量必须要达到500—1000毫克吸收 — — 不仅是摄入 — — 尼古丁。	After reviewing case reports of nicotine intoxications and suicide attempts, the pharmacologist Bernd Mayer found that the lethal dose of nicotine in humans must be somewhere between 500-1000 mg of absorbed – not just ingested – nicotine.
我的公司、网络运营商兼互联网服务提供商英国电信的安全团队每天都能监测到100,000份恶意软件样本 — — 相当于每秒钟超过一次。	The security team of my company, BT, a network operator and Internet service provider, detects 100,000 malware samples every day – that’s more than one per second.
今天，这一数字达到了200 000，这离不开美国（通过其PEPFAR项目）和日内瓦全球基金的慷慨支持。	Today, that figure is 200,000, thanks in large measure to generous support from the United States (under its PEPFAR program) and the Global Fund in Geneva.
即使各方似乎正在对移民的经济影响进行合理的成本效益分析，他们也往往只引用研究和数据来支持自己的立场。	Even when parties seem to be carrying out a reasonable cost-benefit analysis of immigration’s economic impact, they tend to cite only the studies and data that back their own viewpoint.
2014年4月19日在美国无人机打击身亡的四位无辜平民之一的纳赛尔·穆罕默德·纳赛尔（Nasser Mohammed Nasser）的父亲哀痛地说 ： “ 我儿子以及和他一起死去的人和基地组织毫无瓜葛。 他们只是在讨生活的路上。	The testimonies of these individuals, vital for assessing the US drone program, are all too easy to overlook because these individuals are poor and have no political influence, and because the strikes are conducted in secret, far away from the US.
我们同时也就德涅斯特河沿岸（Transdniestria）地区的独立问题重新启动了谈判，而唯一能达成解决方案的基础就是令摩尔多瓦在经济和政治上更具吸引力，从而吸引该地区居民倒向摩尔多瓦。	We have also re-launched settlement talks concerning the breakaway region of Transdniestria, where the only viable basis for a solution is to make Moldova ever more economically and politically attractive to the region’s residents.
首先也是最重要的是反应不力，这不啻于示弱，从而束缚了其扭转俄罗斯吞并克里米亚之势（在策略上，这一事实已经被接受）和遏制其面向东乌克兰的侵略行为的能力。	First and foremost, it has been anemic, projecting an image of weakness that undermines its ability to reverse Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which has been tacitly accepted, or counter its aggressive behavior toward eastern Ukraine.
在这种具有高度传染性及致命性的病毒摧毁对领导人缺乏信任的分裂、贫困的社会之际，承袭原有做法无疑是远远不够的。	With a highly contagious and lethal virus devastating poor and fragmented societies that distrust their leaders, business as usual is not enough.
然而，即使希腊没有受到经济危机影响，要求像它这样的小国独自承担这一负担也是不合理的 — — 特别是面临一年800,000多难民过境的情况。	And yet, even if the country were not crippled by economic crisis, it would be unreasonable to expect a single small country to bear the burden alone – especially in a year when more than 800,000 refugees are expected to pass through its territory.
日本步履蹒跚的复苏可能因为其与中国的领土冲突升级而夭折。 中国是日本商品的主要市场，并且深入融入了日本企业的供应链中。	Japan’s somewhat fragile recovery could be derailed by an escalation of its territorial conflict with China, which is both a major market for Japanese goods and deeply integrated into Japanese firms’ supply chains.
强健的企业部门是开放经济的决定性因素，也决定了一国保持 — — 以及改善 — — 公民生活水平的能力。	A robust business sector is decisive in an open economy, as it shapes a country’s ability to preserve – and improve – its citizens’ living standards.
尽管2015年巴黎气候协议改变了我们谈论气候变化的范式，但世界各国领导人仍然不情愿去实施兑现真正变革所需的举措。	Despite the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which changed the paradigm in which we talk about climate change, world leaders have remained reluctant to do what is needed to make a real difference.
很容易将巨额贸易赤字归咎于阻挠美国政府在本国市场销售的外国政府，这伤害了美国企业，也降低了这些企业员工的生活水平。	It is easy to blame the large trade deficit on foreign governments that block the sale of US products in their markets, which hurts American businesses and lowers their employees’ standard of living.
报告指出，通过降低成本、增进效率，金融技术已经开始动员绿色金融，让穷人能够通过创新性支付系统获得清洁能源，也便利了富人和穷人的绿色储蓄。	As the report points out, by reducing costs and boosting efficiency, fintech is already mobilizing green finance, enabling poorer people to access clean energy through innovative payment systems and facilitating green savings for rich and poor alike.
这些修改后的协议应该包括大胆的、开明的对基础设施以及“社会凝聚力”基金的规定，因为这些东西区分了蒙混过关和真正的成功。	These revised agreements should include bold, enlightened provisions for infrastructure and “social-cohesion” funds, since these can make the difference between muddling through and true success.
但还有许多较小规模的例子，比如俄克拉荷马城，该市的60万人口总共减掉了100万磅体重；我们希望参与其中的人们加入HICCup分享他们的经验，不论好坏。	But there are many smaller-scale examples, such as Oklahoma City, which lost one million pounds of collective weight in a population of about 600,000; we hope the people involved will join with HICCup to share their experiences, good and bad.
在短期内最容易受到自动化影响的活动是那些常规的认知任务，比如数据收集和处理，以及在结构化，可预测环境中的常规手工和体力活动。	The activities most susceptible to automation in the near term are routine cognitive tasks like data collection and data processing, as well as routine manual and physical activities in structured, predictable environments.
奢侈品市场里的类似复兴主要局限于所谓“可负担的奢侈品 ” ： 鞋子，手袋，领带，而不怎么发生在帆船或高速汽车上。	Such recovery as there has been in the luxury market has been largely limited to so-called affordable luxuries – shoes, handbags, or ties, rather than yachts or fast cars.
在不抛弃逻辑和道德的前提下 — — 自由世界秩序恰恰是在这些领域继续胜过替代选项 — — 自由主义者必须与民众建立感情。	Without disregarding logic and ethics – areas where the liberal world order continues to outshine the alternative – liberals must connect with people on an emotional level.
但运用自己土生土长的BREEP探索方法，中国学会了拒绝西方流行的一刀切经济发展理论，认识到促进城市间的竞争、试错、及多样化是探索及实现发展战略突破的很有价值的方法。	But, using its BREEP methodology, China has learned that rejecting one-size-fits-all approaches and promoting competition among cities is a valuable means of achieving breakthroughs in development strategies.
我个人还记得15年前日本公司净值比率低到什么程度 — — 不到20 % ， 而欧洲和美国为30 % 。	I, for one, remember how low the net-worth ratio for Japanese corporations was 15 years ago – below 20%, compared to more than 30% in Europe and the US.
根据世界银行的数据，每年都有500万新增15岁以上人口，而15岁是“告别童年，进入成年的门槛 ” 。	According to the World Bank, each year an additional five million turn 15, “crossing the threshold from childhood to adulthood.”
正如约翰内斯堡大学科学家劳拉·藤森所指出的那样 ， “ 野生动物因其稀少和昂贵而被视为具有更高的价值 。 ”	As University of Johannesburg scientist Laura Tensen has noted, “wild animals are considered superior because of their rarity and high expense.”
如果我们要保全和支持国内外的自由民主，那么在防范新的恐怖袭击的同时了解和避免过去所犯的错误就至关重要。	Preventing new terrorist attacks while understanding and avoiding the mistakes of the past will be essential if we are to preserve and support liberal democracy both at home and abroad.
该协议随后在国会通过应该是理所当然，因为它既没有增加美国的金融义务，也没有影响到美国的投票主宰地位。	The deal’s subsequent approval should have been a no-brainer for Congress, as it neither increased America’s financial obligations nor took away its voting dominance.
中国继续经历快速城市化进程 — — 这一现象为过去的减贫工作提供了巨大的帮助，但同时也使越来越多的城市居民陷入赤贫。	China continues to experience rapid urbanization – a phenomenon that contributed substantially to past poverty reduction, but that also places a growing number of urban dwellers at risk of destitution.
任职总理期间，我领导的政府曾调查俄罗斯乌克兰能源公司，了解谁是它真正的所有者、它采用什么手段获得了对中亚天然气进口的实际控制权、以及利润最终去了哪里。	During my premiership, my government sought to investigate RosUkrEnergo – to discover who precisely its owners are, how it gained a virtual monopoly on the import of Central Asian gas, and where its profits go.
因此 ， （ 同一位记者）问我这难道不是雅典奋力反抗并要求结束威胁希腊生存的紧缩和削减开支的最佳时刻？	Might, therefore, this not be the moment (the same journalists ask) for Athens to rebel and demand the end of austerity and of spending cuts that are detrimental to Greece’s survival?
2013年还将是决定法国命运的一年。 法国政府已经强烈地认识到，不进行痛苦的改革，法国就有可能失败；剩下的问题只是是否能够实施改革。	It will also be a year of destiny for France, whose government is keenly aware that, without painful reforms, the country might be doomed; the only question that remains is whether it can implement them.
SPD的价值观和AfD格格不入。 AfD 已经宣布其主要目标将是用民粹主义和民族主义大论抨击其他政党。	The SPD shares almost no values with the AfD, which has already declared that its main goal will be to hound the other parties with populist and nationalist bombast.
今年5月，在J·克雷格·文特尔研究所，由创办人文特尔亲自率领的研究团队利用化学模块合成了一种全新的细菌基因，并将其植入了另一种细菌的细胞内。	In May, researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute, led by Venter himself, synthesized the genome of a bacterium from scratch using chemical building blocks, and inserted it into the cell of a different variety of bacteria.
除此之外，比索急剧贬值（今年兑面源贬值超过50 % ） ，过去24个月中阿根廷家庭和企业面临的天然气价格平均上涨了1,300 % 。	Add to that a sharply depreciating peso (down by more than 50% against the US dollar this year), and the increase in gas prices faced by households and businesses, on average, amounts to 1,300% over the last 24 months.
而六国 — — 全都是美国的传统盟友 — — 则向特朗普总统提供了相关数据，希望证明贸易对所有国家都非常有利	The rest of the G7 – all traditional US allies – confronted President Donald Trump with data that they hoped would prove that trade had been highly beneficial to all countries.
由于最为没有技能的工人面临降低其工资以及侵蚀其就业能力的道德问题，因此，通过鼓励更大程度的自力更生以及就业补贴将互惠互利重新分配给他们是不无道理的。	Since the least skilled workers face morale problems that lower their wages and erode their employability, it makes sense to deliver the mutual gain that is redistributed to them through subsidies that encourage greater self-support and employment.
标准普尔最近调降了美国国债评级，这一决定所依据的分析受到了不少有理的批评；说到底，标普这样做并没有多少经济学上的理由。	Standard & Poor’s has received some justified criticism for the analysis behind its recent decision to downgrade US government debt; after all, there was little economic news that could explain the move’s timing.
当年毛泽东在文化大革命中整倒身边级别最高的党内大佬刘少奇时，后者的妻子就被戴上乒乓球做成的项链游街，以示其生活奢靡堕落。	When Mao Zedong purged his most senior Party boss, Liu Shaoqi, during the Cultural Revolution, Liu’s wife was paraded through the streets wearing ping-pong balls around her neck as a symbol of wicked decadence and extravagance.
与匈牙利总理欧尔班和已故的委内瑞拉总统查韦斯等其他民粹主义领导人一样，埃尔多安的选举承诺和他的执政表现之间的一致性一直是个谜。	As with other populist leaders, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán or the late Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, reconciling Erdoğan’s electoral promises and his performance in office is a puzzle.
马德里 — — 上个月巴黎大屠杀后刚刚达成的共识似乎是唯有依靠地面入侵才能打败伊斯兰国（ISIS ） 。	MADRID – The general consensus emerging since last month’s carnage in Paris seems to be that the Islamic State (ISIS) can be defeated only by a ground invasion of its “state.”
死刑现在可能被大多数美国人所接受，但在欧洲，事实上是在世界的大部分地区，死刑却被看作严重违背了人权。	Capital punishment may now be supported by a majority of Americans, but the death penalty is regarded as an egregious violation of human rights across Europe - indeed, across much of the world.
参与者包括西英格兰大学的气候学家麦克·霍尔姆（Mike Hulme ） ， 科罗拉多州立大学的气候政策专家小罗杰·皮尔克（Roger Pielke Jr . ） ，还有麦克基尔大学的气候经学家克里斯托弗·格林（Christopher Green ） 。	Participants included climate scientist Mike Hulme of the University of East Anglia, climate policy expert Roger Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado, and climate economist Christopher Green of McGill University.
有了这种想法，我提议对英雄主义进行情境的透视，就像我对邪恶行为进行的透视一样：在我们某些人身上激起 敌对想象 和邪恶行为的情境可以在其他人身上激起 英雄主义的想象 。	With this in mind, I propose a situational perspective for heroism, just as I do for evil: the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination and evil in some of us can inspire the heroic imagination in others.
或者，以联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯所提出的奇怪建议为例，古特雷斯称气候政策将带来“至少价值26万亿美元的经济效益 。 ”	Or consider the strange suggestion by UN chief António Guterres that climate policies will bring “at least $26 trillion in economic benefits.”
例如社会变革和发展需要两者与专政统治所需要的政治稳定原则之间的内在紧张关系，使得当前形势在长期上是不可持续的。	For example, the inherent tension between the social change that development demands and the imperative of political stability required by authoritarian rule makes the current situation unsustainable in the long run.
类似地，中国也开始关注与烧煤有关的高昂的健康成本，据其最新采取的治理空气污染行动计划，三个沿海省份将停止新建煤电产能。	Likewise, China, concerned about the serious health costs linked to burning coal, is prohibiting new coal capacity in three coastal provinces under its newly adopted action plan on air pollution.
中国 — — 曾经是“跟班的天鹅 ” — —现在即将成为领头羊，在今后十年有可能创造8500万个低技能的制造业就业岗位。	China – once a “follower goose” – is on the verge of becoming a leader, with the potential to relocate 85 million low-skilled manufacturing jobs in the coming decade.
但这一增长最近大幅放缓，让许多人开始质疑经济学家给它们贴上全球经济增长新引擎的标签是不是操之过急了。	But that growth has lately slowed substantially, leading many to question whether economists spoke too soon when we labeled them the new engines of global economic growth.
事实上，在利比亚、叙利亚、克里米亚和顿巴斯等地区，国家支持的非国家行动方层出不穷，让国家和非国家暴力的界限日益模糊。	Indeed, the proliferation of state-sponsored non-state actors in places like Libya, Syria, Crimea, and Donbas is blurring the distinction between state and non-state violence.
去年秋天，在美国商务部认定中国向美国市场“倾销 ” （ 一般定义为以低于成本价销售）罪名成立后，美国对从中国进口的太阳能电池板征收24－36%的关税。	Last fall, the US introduced tariffs of 24-36% against Chinese solar-panel imports, after the Commerce Department determined that China had been “dumping” – which is generally defined as selling at a price below cost – into the American market.
在此期间，美联储提出了一项到2022~2023年度前不去实现资产负债表正常化的策略，其运作时长比2000年代中期那个设计不佳的行动还要长2.5~3倍。	In the current period, the Fed has outlined a strategy that does not achieve balance-sheet normalization until 2022-2023 at the earliest – 2.5-3 times as long as the ill-designed campaign of the mid-2000s.
他选择了妥协：明确表达自己对这份协定的鄙夷，而不退出这份协定，也不重启作为该协定一部分被取消的制裁（如果这样做的话，等同于美国撤出该协定 ） 。	What he chose was a compromise: to make clear his disdain for the agreement without leaving it or reintroducing sanctions that were removed as part of it (a step that would be tantamount to US withdrawal).
但新证据表明，现代人进化于相对晚近的非洲 — — 且他们在约60 000年前分化之后所经历的改变并非连续。	But new evidence suggests that modern humans evolved relatively recently in Africa – and that the transformation that they underwent after their departure some 60,000 years ago was far from seamless.
他们手中的铀并非武器级材料；国际核查人员在1991年海湾战争后将所有敏感材料运出了伊拉克（2003年美国入侵时也因此没有找到任何敏感材料 ） 。	The captured uranium was not weapons-grade; international inspectors removed all sensitive material from Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War (which is why it was absent when the United States invaded in 2003).
他们对此的回应就是要求在南海实施强硬军事行动，并筹划要象征性地登上钓鱼/尖阁列岛，正如今年8月15日香港保钓人士所做的那样。	Their response is to call for tough military action in the South China Sea, and to stage symbolic landings on the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, such as those staged by Hong Kong activists on August 15.
我们所需要的只是进行恰当的财政刺激来诱使电力公司生产更少的电能（但是同时确保更高的利润）以及使消费者减少他们使用的电能（在减少开支的同时并没有降低舒适度 ） 。	All that is needed are the right financial incentives to induce utility companies to produce less electricity (and still be more profitable) and consumers to reduce their use (and gain savings without sacrificing comfort).
但是大多数美国人，尽管在布什第一任期内曾支持过减税（因为减税能让他们得到一点点额外的现金 ） ， 现在却不支持随后对基本政府服务的抨击。	But the majority of Americans, having supported the tax cuts in Bush’s first term because it gave them a little extra cash, do not support the attack on basic government services that has followed.
柏林—2015年巴黎气候协定签署后，许多决策者听信了石油和天然气行业关于如何帮助降低温室气体排放的说辞。	BERLIN – Since the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015, too many policymakers have fallen for the oil and gas industry’s rhetoric about how it can help to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
特朗普要想兑现他的承诺 — — 提高基础设施和国防支出，同时大规模减税和降低赤字，只能大量使用所谓的巫毒经济学。	The only way Trump will square his promises of higher infrastructure and defense spending with large tax cuts and deficit reduction is a heavy dose of what used to be called voodoo economics.
国际能源署成功地建立和监督一种能控制各国石油产量的体系，避免石油危机的再次发生。 它拥有高效能的专家团队，提供世界能源数据的主要来源，在全球暖化辩论中起到关键性的作用。	With a small but highly competent professional staff, the IEA has also become the primary source for the world’s energy statistics and is playing a key role in the climate debate.
然而随着整合市场的发展，电力需求可以通过加纳，科特迪瓦和几内亚等电量富余国与布基纳法索和马里等其他以往依赖昂贵液体燃料的发电短缺国之间的调配来解决。	With an integrated market, however, power demand could be met as countries such as Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, and Guinea produce surpluses, while others such as Burkina Faso and Mali are in deficit and reliant on costly liquid fuels.
如果国家在所面临的挑战面前屈服 ， “ 法国将比在前途未卜的海洋上漂浮着的破旧的可怜玩具好不了多少 ， ” 他发出警告。	If the state bowed before the challenge it faced, “France would be no more than a poor, broken toy floating on an ocean of uncertainty,” he warned.
但5年之后的日本入侵又把缅甸及其人民压制在殖民统治之下，而日军的扫荡也最终被遏制在当今印度曼尼普尔区首府英帕尔一线。	But the Japanese invasion five years later subjugated Burma and its people to colonial rule once again, with the conquering sweep of the Imperial Japanese Army checked only at Imphal, in India’s Manipur state.
这一裁决让很多欧洲人将施雷姆斯和爱德华·斯诺登（Edward Snowden）相提并论。 斯诺登是一位美国情报承包商，他将关于美国全球监控计划的保密信息泄露给公众。	The ruling led many in Europe to draw comparisons between Schrems and Edward Snowden, the intelligence contractor who leaked classified information detailing America’s global surveillance programs.
他将带领同僚们展开对话，其内容涵盖教育、传染病等诸多议题，而且为了确保没人打瞌睡¾¾对话中还将就“能源安全”问题展开讨论。	He plans to lead his colleagues in erudite conversations about education, infectious diseases, and – to make sure that no one dozes off – “energy security.”
如今，同样重要的是巩固新乌克兰政府中的温和派，减小可能践踏操俄语的乌克兰人权利的右翼民族主义者的影响力。	It is now equally important to strengthen the moderate members of the new Ukrainian government and to reduce the influence of right-wing nationalists who would trample on the rights of Russian-speaking Ukrainians.
世界有足够的零碳能源用来推动整个全球经济的发展 — — 事实上，零碳能源可以推动的全球经济规模可以远大于今天。	The world has enough zero-carbon energy sources to power the entire global economy – indeed to power a global economy much larger than today’s.
20世纪70年代初，美国人和欧洲人工作时数大体相同；而今天，法德两国的欧洲人比美国人平均少工作50%以上。	Americans and Europeans worked the same number of hours in the early 1970's. Today, Europeans work 50% less on average in France and Germany than in the US.
其中一位支持者柯南·阿尔贝（Kenan Alpay）最近写道“土耳其不能成为旨在剿灭从穆斯林兄弟会到 … … 阿富汗塔利班的一切伊斯兰运动的国际体系的一部分 。 ”	As one such supporter, Kenan Alpay, recently wrote, “Turkey cannot be a part of an international system that aims to dissolve all Islamic movements from the Muslim Brotherhood to…the Taliban in Afghanistan.”
在这方面，中国的由党来领导重大改革的政治体制可能有其显而易见的优势：中国领导人能够做出政治上十分痛苦的决定而不必担心短期的选举。	Here, China’s one-party system provides a clear advantage: the country’s leaders can take politically painful decisions without worrying about the next election.
发展中国家受制于人力和金融资本水平低下，以及外汇储备不足或难以获得外汇（这限制了它们进口提高其全球价值链地位所需要的原材料和设备的能力 ） 。	Developing countries today are constrained by low levels of human and financial capital, and by low reserves of or access to foreign exchange, which limits their ability to import the raw materials and equipment needed to ascend global value chains.
信息和通信技术、金融、保险、运输、地产，繁荣的服务型经济中每一项主要要素都离不开其他要素的繁荣，而正是城市将这些要素聚拢，即所谓的网络关联外部性现象。	Each of a thriving service economy’s major components – ICT, finance, insurance, transportation, and real estate – needs the others to prosper, and cities are what bring them all together – a phenomenon of network externalities.
在剩下的交谈以及我和他一同前往伦敦郊区的行程中，布莱尔的言谈举止好似他还有整个首相要处理的事情，从全球变暖到阿富汗重建等等。	For the rest of the conversation, and on the trip to the outskirts of London that I also took with him, Blair talked and acted as if he had a full Prime Ministerial agenda on everything from global warming to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
今天，世界上只有不到10%的国家是同质的，将民族自决作为首要的道德原则会在许多地区造成灾难性的后果。	Today, with less than 10% of the world’s states being homogeneous, treating self-determination as a primary moral principle could have disastrous consequences in many regions.
而右翼方面，希拉克对萨尔科奇的敌意会在一定阶段导致另一位候选人的出现，这个人可能是国防部长米谢勒·阿利奥·马里（Michele Alliot-Marie ） ， 也可能就是希拉克本人。	On the right, Chirac’s antagonism toward Sarkozy makes it that another candidate will appear at some point, either Michele Alliot-Marie, the defense minister, or Chirac himself.
因为宗教而对穆斯林施以极端主义行为同样存在，如今，基督教、犹太教、印度教和佛教徒都有狂热教徒抹黑着他们的信仰的真正性质。	There are extremist acts perpetrated against Muslims because of their religion, and today there are fanatical Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists who disfigure the true nature of their faith.
与成员国国内的结构改革相比，欧洲更加需要欧元区本身的结构改革以及扭转紧缩政策 — — 紧缩政策在提振经济增长方面一而再、再而三地失败。	What Europe needs more than structural reform within member countries is reform of the structure of the eurozone itself, and a reversal of austerity policies, which have failed time and again to reignite economic growth.
为了延缓抗药性的蔓延，争取足够的时间让新药投入生产，必须实现一个紧迫的短期目标：阻止抗药性占领南亚和东南亚并向其他地区蔓延。	In order to delay the spread of resistance long enough to allow new drugs to come onstream, an urgent short-term objective must be achieved: preventing resistance from taking hold in South and Southeast Asia and spreading elsewhere.
短期生态健康理念关注产卵问题，因为很多鱼类的产卵数量和它们的体格大小成正比。 体格较大的个体与体格较小的个体比较而言，对未来种群数量的影响也会更大。	The short-term issue concerns egg production, which in many fish is proportional to body size: large individuals contribute far more to future generations than small individuals.
此外，许多技术创新没有转化为更高的生产率增长，结构改革速度仍然缓慢，漫长的周期性停滞侵蚀着实体资本的技能基础。	Moreover, many technological innovations have not translated into higher productivity growth, the pace of structural reforms remains slow, and protracted cyclical stagnation has eroded the skills base and that of physical capital.
事实上，特朗普在选战期间向其支持者所许下的许多承诺具有高度的分裂性，甚至可以说非常危险，而兑现这些承诺有可能给普通美国人的生活带来严重负面影响，引发社会动荡。	In fact, many of the promises Trump made to his supporters during the campaign are highly divisive and even dangerous, and their implementation could have serious adverse effects on the lives of ordinary Americans, triggering civil unrest.
虽然深化世界经济之间的相互关系推动了经济增长，使数百万人摆脱了贫困提高了生活水平，但这些收益的分配却是不充分的。	While deepening interconnections among the world’s economies have fueled growth, lifted millions out of poverty, and raised living standards, the benefits have not been sufficiently shared.
然而克里姆林宫在军事事务上的急功近利，以及其试图同西方来一场零和博弈的无意义企图，已经将俄罗斯变成了被周边小型伙伴国玩弄于股掌之中的一个小木偶。	But the Kremlin’s myopic concentration on military matters, and its pointless attempts to play a zero-sum game with the West has turned Russia into an object for manipulation by its junior partners.
从一个层面来看，这一差异可以解释为G7内斗对增长只存在微小而狭隘的影响，特别是与货币政策等因素相比。	On one level, this disparity can be explained by the fact that G7 infighting will have only a small and narrow impact on growth, especially compared to factors like monetary policy.
虽然有许多退休人员和一些工人对卢卡申科的统治表示满意，但许多年轻人和受过教育的人都在去年12月的大选中投了反对票 — — 大量证据显示总统只获得了全部票数中的不到50%	While many pensioners and some workers remain content with life under Lukashenko, young people, and those with the most education and talent, voted against him in December – and much evidence suggests that he won less than 50%.
东京 — — 2008年，美国国家情报委员会（NIC）发布2025年全球趋势，其中一个关键的预测是能源竞争将更加激烈。	TOKYO – In 2008, when the United States’ National Intelligence Council (NIC) published its volume Global Trends 2025, a key prediction was tighter energy competition.
但在欧洲随波逐流、世界即将堕入深渊的一刻，我们不能剥夺他 — — 这部分归功于他著名的“傲慢 ” — —作为抵御新国际民族主义少数派的光荣。	But, in a Europe adrift and a world on the edge of the abyss, we cannot take away from him the virtue of being one of the last who – partly owing to his famous “arrogance” – is capable of resisting the new nationalist international.
新的政党也由此出现，1997年成立的区域委员会使得像莫拉莱斯这样具有强大地方根基的政治领袖在没有任何主要政党支持的情况下成功跻身于玻利维亚议会。	This led to the formation of new political parties, and the creation of regional councils in 1997 made it possible for leaders with strong local roots – like Morales – to reach Bolivia’s congress without any major party’s backing.
服务导向型增长从很多方面来说都能解决“不稳定、不平衡、不协调并最终不可持续”的增长模式 — — 众所周知前总理温家宝批评过这一模式。	Services-led growth is, in many ways, the antidote to the “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and ultimately unsustainable” growth model that former Premier Wen Jiabao’s famously criticized in 2007.
在同一时期，美国的年化进口量比美国的年化出口量多下降了2840亿美元，中国的年化贸易顺差增加了2490亿美元。	During the same period, annualized US imports declined by $284 billion more than US exports, and China’s annualized trade surplus increased by $249 billion.
2009年时希腊预算赤字相当于GDP的15 ％ ； 参与国际货币基金组织项目后的2010年赤字有所下降，但仅跌至11 ％ 。	In 2009, the Greek budget deficit was 15% of GDP; with an IMF program, the deficit fell in 2010, but only to 11% of GDP.
其中一个就是消除美国推翻萨达姆政权后伊朗在邻国伊拉克所获得的战略优势，因为当时这一举动帮助人口占多数的伊拉克什叶派穆斯林民众夺取了权力。	One consideration is the need to neutralize the strategic advantage that Iran gained from the US overthrow of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq – a development that helped to empower Iraq’s Shia majority.
中国这样的国家，它的高储蓄率超过了本地投资需要，可以支持储蓄较少的世界其他地区的投资，特别是低收入的非洲和亚洲地区。	A country such as China, with a high saving rate that exceeds local investment needs, can support investment in other parts of the world that save less, notably low-income Africa and Asia.
受到支持的政府发誓将镇压那些进行暴力活动的团体，并宣布计划赋予执法机关权力使他们有权解散威胁“安全和社会秩序”的组织。	Newly emboldened, the government pledged to crackdown on groups that engage in violence, and announced plans to empower authorities to disband organizations that threaten ‘security and order.’
在他任职期间，他出资支持了许多早期科技公司，聘用了纽约市第一位首席数字官，成立了一家新大学开发高科技人才。	During his tenure in office, he funded early-stage technology companies, hired the city’s first chief digital officer, and launched a new university to develop high-tech talent.
因此，即使高企的失业水平会打击消费、房价、银行资产负债表、对自由贸易的支持以及公共财政，进一步出台刺激政策的空间正变得越来越小。	Thus, even as mounting job losses undermine consumption, housing prices, banks’ balance sheets, support for free trade, and public finances, the room for further policy stimulus is becoming narrower.
其中 一个能说明问题的例子就是美联储针对2008年就业刺激政策时机和效果所使用的宏观经济模型预测，和最终结果之间简直相差十万八千里。	The projections implied by the Fed’s macro-econometric model concerning the timing and effects of the 2008 economic stimulus on unemployment, which have been notoriously wide of the mark, are a case in point.
发自纽约 — — 我最近去了不丹，一个坐落于喜马拉雅上脚下，拥有绝美自然风光，丰富文化内涵以及振奋人心的反省精神的王国。	NEW YORK – I have just returned from Bhutan, the Himalayan kingdom of unmatched natural beauty, cultural richness, and inspiring self-reflection.
能源使用的高涨正反映了人均收入提高 - - 引发人均能源使用的提高 - - 以及人口增长的综合影响。	Total energy use is soaring, reflecting the combined effect of rising per capita incomes - and thus rising per capita energy use - and population growth.
过去脊髓灰质炎疫苗无法触及的儿童生活在无法获得常规免疫接种、孕产妇保健、营养补充剂、驱虫或疟疾预防的社区。	The children that had previously not been reached with polio vaccines live in communities with little or no access to routine immunization, maternal healthcare, nutritional supplements, deworming, or malaria prevention.
但要接受这一思路，你必须忽视一个两种垄断之间的根本性差别。 一种垄断源于市场的自由运行，另一种垄断来自国家强制。	But to follow to this line of thinking, one must ignore a fundamental distinction between two kinds of monopolies: those that emerge from the free operation of the market; and those that are a result of state coercion.
更高的市场准入度，市场改革和协调监管的努力—包括那些在欧盟的《金融服务行动纲领》中的条款—都有助于推动这一潮流。	Greater market access, market reform, and efforts at regulatory harmonization - including those under the EU's Financial Services Action Plan - should help advance this trend.
尽管如此，希腊事实上仍试图摧毁金色黎明党 — — 议会刚刚投票冻结了该党的国家资金支持 — — 这一事实表明，说到底，大部分民主国家总会在某处划出一条界线。	The fact that Greece nonetheless is effectively trying to destroy Golden Dawn – the parliament just voted to freeze the party’s state funding – suggests that, in the end, most democracies will want to draw the line somewhere.
大部分观察者会说，政府债务水平在许多发达经济体高得令人害怕，因此决策者应该讨论用什么战略减少债务才算审慎。	Most observers would agree that government debt levels are uncomfortably high in many advanced economies, so it would be prudent for policymakers to discuss strategies for bringing them down.
但是，从中期看，拒绝欧盟、投入俄罗斯怀抱的乌克兰有可能丧失其独立性，而这一独立性也是后苏联时代欧洲秩序的基础。	In the medium term, however, by rejecting the EU and embracing Russia, Ukraine faces the risk of losing its independence – on which the post-Soviet order in Europe depends.
正如法国总理曼努埃尔·瓦尔斯（Manuel Valls）最近撰文指出，欧洲领导人面临的关键问题是“放弃并坐视欧洲项目走向缓慢但必然的终结”还是“实现欧盟的转型 ” 。	As French Prime Minister Manuel Valls recently wrote, the key question facing Europe’s leaders is whether to “give up and leave the European project to a slow but certain death” or to “transform the EU.”
2006年朱尔斯·普雷迪（Jules Pretty）所做的农业生态实践研究考察了57个国家的286个可持续农业项目，结论是产量平均提高了79 % 。	A study of agro-ecological farming practices by Jules Pretty in 2006 examined 286 sustainable agricultural projects in 57 countries and concluded that yields had increased an average of 79%.
近12年前，高盛首席经济学家奥尼尔（Jim O’Neil）创造了“金砖”一词描述巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国四个“新兴市场 ” 。	Nearly 12 years ago, Jim O’Neill, then the chief economist for Goldman Sachs, coined the term “BRIC” to describe the “emerging markets” of Brazil, Russia, India, and China.
历史学家鲁斯·盖伊（Ruth Gay）写过一本名为《在德国人中间寻找安全 》 （ Safe Among the Germans）的重要著作，描写的就是这250,000名幸存者。	“Safe Among the Germans” proclaimed the title of an important book by the historian Ruth Gay about these 250,000 survivors.
这又令我回想起1989年时在波兰举行的“圆桌会议 ” ， 波兰团结工会成员与共产党执政当局一起坐下来，商讨这个政权的最终命运。	I was reminded of Poland’s “roundtable” in 1989, when Solidarity sat with the ruling communists to negotiate the end of the regime.
农业，主要是自给自足型农业，养活了非洲 超过60%的劳动人口，造成对谋生手段的广泛破坏，更不要说因为作物被破坏影响了粮食安全。	Agriculture, predominantly subsistence farming, employs over 60% of the African workforce, implying widespread destruction of livelihoods, to say nothing of increased food insecurity as crops are disrupted.
这些用具包括按揭合格标准（如贷款/房屋价值比和贷款/收入比）和动态拔备（即在房地产繁荣期提高银行的法定贷款损失准备金 ） 。	These include mortgage eligibility criteria, such as loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios, and dynamic provisioning (that is increasing banks’ mandatory loan-loss reserves during housing booms).
陈水扁总是指责国民党阻挠一系列明智经济计划的通过，但即使是他自己的一些富有的资助者都有对这些计划嗤之以鼻。	Chen invariably blamed the KMT for blocking sensible economic plans, but even some of his moneyed supporters knew better.
但是，人民币最近已经稳定下来，资本外逃也得到了遏制，好于预期的10月7日中国人民银行储备数字证明了这一点。	The renminbi, however, has recently stabilized, and capital flight has dwindled, as evidenced by the better-than-expected reserve figures released by the People’s Bank of China on October 7.
因此，世界野生动物基金指出，我们所使用的已经超出了地球所能提供资源的30 ％ ， 而且情况还会变得更糟。	So the WWF points out that we are already living beyond Earth’s means, using around 30% too much. And it will get worse.
这种转变的主要驱动力是中国。 过去五年来，中国一直在通过在南中国海建造人工岛礁来将其边界向国际水域推进。	The main driver of this shift has been China, which over the last five years has been working to push its borders far out into international waters, by building artificial islands in the South China Sea.
虽然亚洲国家大都愿意保持甚至扩大与中国的经济关系，但除了依赖中国援助的朝鲜之外，都不准备接其作为该地区的主要势力。	While Asian countries are largely willing to maintain and even expand their economic ties with China, none (except North Korea, which depends on Chinese aid) is prepared to accept it as the region’s primary power.
这些工作中有超过半数 — — 这些体面的工作可以提高贫困家庭的收入和生活水平 — — 主要分配给女性求职者。	More than half of those jobs – decent jobs that could raise incomes and living standards, particularly for poor households – would go to women.
事实上，宪法宣言保护总统指令不受法官裁决影响（尽管穆尔西表示这只包括“主权”问题，而且只是权宜之计 ） 。	Indeed, the declaration protects presidential decrees from judicial review (although Morsi stipulated that it pertains only to “sovereignty” matters, and stressed its temporary nature).
在今年6月3日，当我同其他记者一道参观关塔那摩的时候，那里的新闻办公室公布了一则简短的公告：阿尔-哈纳什被发现死在他自己的牢房内 — — 一起“显而易见的自杀事件 ” 。	On June 3, while I was visiting Guantánamo with other journalists, the press office there issued a terse announcement that al-Hanashi had had been found dead in his cell – an “apparent suicide.”
怪异的举止 — — 奇特的上流社会习性、财大气粗的生活、离谱的笑话、故意表现出的粗鲁和疯狂的发型 — — 都能在政治上加分。	Weirdness – peculiar upper-class mannerisms, ostentatious living, outrageous jokes, deliberate crassness, and mad hairstyles – is an asset.
在仔细研究了两种语言之间的微妙翻译差异并排除了可能导致受访者答案产生偏差的不相干关联后，我们拿出了两份几乎相同的俄语和英语问卷。	After laboring over subtleties of translation and possible extraneous associations that might bias respondents’ answers, we arrived at a set of virtually identical questionnaires in both Russian and English.
其次，一些雇主获得激励减少个体雇员的工作时长，因为超过一定时常，奥巴马医改就会给它们带来更大的负担。	Second, some employers are being incented to reduce the number of working hours for individual employees, because, above a specified number, Obamacare imposes a larger burden on them.
这也是拉里·萨莫斯（Larry Summers）引用埃尔文·汉森（Alvin Hansen）在1938年发表的一篇论文里提到的“长期性经济停滞”概念 。 。	This is the ailment that Larry Summers, recalling a 1938 paper by Alvin Hansen, has dubbed “secular stagnation.”
另外，美国的反应也��化了以色列对军事解决方式有效性的信心，从而导致了最近的黎巴嫩战争和对加沙的入侵。	Moreover, the US response has strengthened Israel’s belief in the effectiveness of military methods, leading to the recent war in Lebanon and the ongoing invasion of Gaza.
与当时一样，今天的投资水平和质量也一直欠缺，对有形和无形资本 — — 长期增长的关键因素 — — 的公共支出持续大大低于最有水平。	And now, as then, the level and quality of investment have been consistently inadequate, with public spending on tangible and intangible capital – a critical factor in long-term growth – well below optimal levels for some time.
促使美国态度发生变化的第二个因素是认识到新叙利亚政府对于击败 — — 甚至遏制 — — 伊斯兰国至关重要。	The second factor that is spurring a shift in America’s attitude is the recognition that a new Syrian government is vital to defeat – or even contain – the Islamic State.
他的宗派主义独裁行为导致了埃及的极化，以至于以同情伊斯兰教著称的军队首脑西西（Abdul Fattah al-Sisi）将军也不再支持任命了他的穆尔西。	His sectarian, authoritarian behavior polarized his country to such a degree that even the army’s chief, General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, known for his Islamist sympathies, withdrew his support from the man who had appointed him.
事实上，托马斯·萨金特（Thomas Sargent）去年获得诺贝尔奖之后，在获奖演说中援引了汉密尔顿的举措作为先例。	Indeed, after Thomas Sargent won the Nobel Prize in Economics last year, he cited it as a precedent in his acceptance speech.
在巴黎 ， 《 查理周刊》造就了民主自由的精神形式：写、画和出版任何东西的权利 — — 哪怕它们包括了极端的（有时是低俗的）挑衅。	In Paris, Charlie Hebdo has given form to the spirit of democratic freedom: the ability to write, draw, and publish anything – even extreme (and at times vulgar) provocations.
此举成功抵消了因私营部门去杠杆化所导致的严重经济紊乱，但却是以破坏自身财政收支平衡以及扰乱央行资产负债表为代价的。	They succeeded in offsetting nasty economic dislocations caused by private-sector deleveraging, but at the cost of encumbering their fiscal balances and their central banks’ balance sheets.
在以歌颂和平、科学和法律为主题的获奖演讲中，她诠释了哲学家马丁·海德格尔（Martin Heidegger）的思想，说“只有一个词可以拯救我们 。 ”	In a speech lauding peace, science, and law, she paraphrased the philosopher Martin Heidegger, proclaiming “only a word can save us.”
发自华盛顿特区 — — 前美国财政部长劳伦斯·萨默斯（Lawrence H. Summers）最近打趣说 : “ 财政刺激就像一种存在耐受性的药物；为了保持持续增长，就必须得让赤字不断扩大 。 ”	WASHINGTON, DC – Former US Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers recently quipped that, “Fiscal stimulus is like a drug with tolerance effects; to keep growth constant, deficits have to keep getting larger.”
但对中国和G7国家自主创新的估计表明，中国在20世纪90年代已经名列第四；而在此后十年，英国和加拿大逐渐掉队，中国已经跃居第二 — — 并且距离美国已经不远。	Yet estimates of indigenous innovation in China and the G7 countries show that China already ranked fourth in the 1990s; and in the next decade, when the UK and Canada fell back, China moved up to second place – not very far behind the US.
鉴于这个国际货币基金组织用来跟踪自身金融交易的特别提款权其实并没有什么重要性，中国当局将人民币往里面塞的努力也更多就是摆个花架子而��。	Given that the SDR, which the IMF uses to keep track of its own financial transactions, is of little practical importance, the Chinese authorities’ effort to add the renminbi to it amounts to little more than a vanity project.
通常，默认现象对绝大多数人来说是可持续的 — — 比如，它通常会将所有储蓄都配置给低回报货币市场基金。	Often, the default option is unsuitable for most individuals – for instance, it typically allocates all savings to low-return money-market funds.
其他人，比如保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman ） ， 则认为这是一种欺瞒：保守党一心想要小政府，为此不惜牺牲经济增长。	Others, such as the economist Paul Krugman, see it as an act of bad faith: the Tories just want smaller government, regardless of the consequences for growth.
而在突尼斯，来自本阿里家族特拉贝尔西分支的继任者与总统通过他的第二任妻子莱拉·特拉贝尔西联系在一起 — — 这可能会损害与本阿里前妻的女儿有关的牵涉面极广的家族利益。	In Tunisia, a successor from the Trabelsi branch of the Ben Ali clan – linked to the president through his second wife, Leila Trabelsi – could target the extensive interests of families related to Ben Ali’s daughters from a previous marriage.
这场危机提醒我们每个人对他人的亏欠，并揭示了一个我们很快忘却的道德真相：富人比穷人更能从与社会其他成员的合作中所获得利益。	The crisis reminds us what each person owes to others, highlighting an ethical truth that we were quick to forget: the rich benefit more than the poor from their cooperation with other members of society.
许多支持英国退出的人搬出一些政策和监管规则 — — 比如欧盟与加拿大和新加坡的自由贸易协定 — — 胡乱拼凑出一幅身在欧洲之外的英国的图景。	Many advocates of withdrawal cherry-pick policies and regulations, such as provisions of the EU’s free-trade agreements with Canada and Singapore, to cobble together a vision of what life would like be for the UK outside of Europe.
塞尔维亚总理（当时任总统）伊斯拉夫·科什图尼察2001年成立真相委员会的企图从一开始就被指控为缺乏公正，成立起来的真相委员会也不到一年就遭到解散的厄运。	Serbian Prime Minister (then President) Vojislav Kostunica’s attempt in 2001 to set up a truth commission was doomed from the outset by allegations of bias, and was disbanded within a year.
对于人造细菌可能的利用领域来说 ， “ 辛西娅”的诞生必须和墨西哥湾这场世界最严重的漏油事故争夺新闻头条的事实比任何公关行动都更有说服力。	As for the likely usefulness of synthetic bacteria, the fact that Synthia’s birth had to compete for headlines with news of the world’s worst-ever oil spill made the point more effectively than any public-relations effort could have done.
更为重要的是，这些移民不再局限于农村人口，而且他们不再只是前往移民在美国的传统落脚点。 事实上，他们无处不在。	Moreover, these migrants are no longer exclusively of rural origin, nor do they travel only to traditional areas in the US; they are, literally, everywhere.
这一假设促使经济学家成为“干预怀疑派 ” ， 对于一切没有显而易见的监管需要的问题，都偏向于市场方案。	This assumption led economists to become “intervention skeptics” who preferred market-based solutions for any problem where the need for regulation was not obvious.
笔者（连同里卡多·豪斯曼，安德烈斯·瓦拉斯科以及其他研究者）针对增长状况诊断方式的研究就是这类工作的例子，展现出如何在一个特定背景下从多个增长制约性因素中筛选出其中较为相关的。	My research on growth diagnostics (with Ricardo Hausmann, Andrés Velasco, and others) is an example of this style of work, showing how one can identify in a specific context the more binding among a multitude of growth constraints.
这种临界点是否是人类活动的结果目前尚不清楚 — — 但在人类开始干预地球能量平衡前长达11,500年的全新世时期却从未出现过类似的改变。	It is not completely clear whether humans have caused this tipping – though nothing like it has ever occurred during the 11,500-year Holocene period before humans started interfering with the planet’s energy balance.
类似地，马可尼在长途无线电传输方面的工作原本只是为了与电报竞争；他从未构想过广播电台和现代无线通讯。	Likewise, Guglielmo Marconi’s work on long-distance radio transmission was intended simply to create competition for the telegraph; Marconi never envisioned broadcast radio stations or modern wireless communication.
颇具影响力的活动家乔治·蒙比奥特表示“气候变化”这个字眼还不足以令人警醒，因此应当用“气候崩溃”这个词来取代它。	Influential campaigner George Monbiot says “climate change” isn’t alarming enough, so should be replaced with “climate breakdown.”
但尽管土耳其关于库尔德抵抗的担忧并非毫无依据，但库尔德人实际建国的希望依然非常渺茫，因为这样一个库尔德国家将处在伊朗、伊拉克、土耳其和叙利亚等强烈反对库尔德人建国的四个国家的夹击之下。	But, while Turkey’s concerns about Kurdish resistance are not unfounded, the chances of actual Kurdish statehood remain slim, because such a state would be wedged between four countries – Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria – that bitterly oppose it.
盈利可能在相当长（但非无穷）的时间内以快于收入的速度增长，如果公司削减成本或降低投资的话 — — 这一趋势随着时间的延长可以降低折旧。	Earnings can grow faster than revenues for a prolonged (though not indefinite) period, if companies cut costs or reduce investment – a trend that would, over time, lower depreciation charges.
在2018年的前九个月，世界已经经历了平生罕见的历史性天气事件 — — 从美国西部、希腊和瑞典因干旱导致的森林火灾到夏威夷、印度南部和南亚其他地方的洪水。	In the first nine months of 2018, the world has experienced a lifetime’s worth of “historic” weather events – from drought-fueled forest fires in the American West, Greece, and Sweden, to floods in Hawaii, southern India, and elsewhere in South Asia.
在经历了60年只有通过政变才能实现军事领导权更迭后，由平民所领导的政府在军政府任期结束后取代了武装部队指挥官担任领导职务。	After more than 60 years of changes in military leadership coming only after coups, the civilian-led government replaced the commander of the armed forces at the end of his term.
问题在于智利的税后基尼系数在50左右（巴西、哥伦比亚和秘鲁也是如此 ） ， 而发达国家的基尼系数大多在30以下甚至20大几。	The problem is that Chile’s after-tax Gini coefficient is approximately 50 (Brazil, Colombia, and Peru have similar figures), while those of the advanced countries are mostly in the low 30’s or even the high 20’s.
因此就有个好消息，那就是美国经济和金融投资者在未来几年内都不大可能迎来大规模的通货膨胀或者通货紧缩。	So the good news is that the possibility of significant inflation or deflation during the next few years is low on the list of economic risks faced by the US economy and by financial investors.
但由于担心货币走强会对贸易产生影响，中国人民银行在过去十多年来都积极利用买入美元的手法来阻止人民币升值。	But, fearing the impact a stronger currency would have on trade, the PBOC has spent more than a decade working actively to impede appreciation, by exchanging renminbi for dollars.
金正恩的亲和姿态（不管是真的还是装的）和去核化承诺让悄然化解了特朗普的威胁，拉近了韩国政府，并影响到针对其政权的国际制裁。	Kim’s bonhomie (real or feigned) and promises of denuclearization have muted Trump’s threats, brought the South Korean government closer to his side, and eroded international sanctions against his regime.
它被定义为“蓄意整体或部分消灭某一民族、人种，种族或宗教团体的行动 ” ， 而其重点则是“蓄意”而非被杀害者的数目。	It refers to “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.” The emphasis is on “intent,” not on the numbers of people whose lives are destroyed.
而自从那一幕幕最终定格在美军直升机于废弃的西贡美国大使馆上空盘旋的经典画面之后，越南也淡出了人们的视线之外，被遗忘了。	But ever since those immortal scenes of US army helicopters hovering above the abandoned US embassy in Saigon in 1975, Vietnam has mostly slipped from the world’s consciousness.
中国魅力攻势中最重要的元素是其试图改善与日本的关系，首先是在最近的APEC北京峰会上，习近平与日本首相安倍晋三举行了场外会晤。	The most important element of China’s charm offensive is its effort to improve relations with Japan, initiated at a meeting between Xi and Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the sidelines of the recent APEC meeting in Beijing.
短期因素 — — 如政治动荡、与气候有关的干扰和投机行为 — — 虽然也是价格的重要决定因素，但只是部分因素。	While short-term factors – for example, political instability, weather-related disruptions, and speculative activity – are important determinants of prices, they tell only part of the story.
首先，虽然中东大部战火不断，但并未发生石油供给冲击或禁运，美国的页岩气革命也增加了低成本能源的供给。	For starters, even with much of the Middle East burning, there have been no oil-supply shocks or embargos, and the shale-gas revolution in the United States has increased the supply of low-cost energy.
调查者认为，一个根本原因是自满：核电站的管理者认为他们的安全系统是鲁棒的，并且不存在有效的独立监督。	Investigators concluded that one of the underlying causes was complacency: those in charge of the facility believed that their safety systems were robust, and there was no effective independent oversight.
脆弱性的下限远远高于世界银行1.25美元/天的贫困线标准，特别是考虑到全世界工作不稳定性和社会保障不足问题日益严重的情况下。	Vulnerability exists at levels far above the World Bank’s $1.25/day poverty threshold, especially given rising job insecurity and inadequate social protection worldwide.
为了应对国内权力挑战，俄罗斯总统普京的外交政策可能变得更加激进，而约旦、黎巴嫩和土耳其都因为叙利亚的崩溃而正在受到冲击。	Russian President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy may become more aggressive in response to challenges to his power at home, while Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey are all being destabilized by Syria’s ongoing meltdown.
例如在大萧条时期，美国总统赫伯特·胡佛签署了1930年《斯穆特-霍利关税法案 》 ， 意图保护美国工人和农民免受外国竞争。	For example, during the Great Depression, US President Herbert Hoover signed the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, intended to protect American workers and farmers from foreign competition.
从2007年到2009年10月，美国失去了近800万个工作岗位，就业人口率从63%下降到58.5 % 。	From 2007 to October 2009, the United States lost nearly eight million jobs, which reduced the employment-population ratio from 63% to 58.5%.
法国驻美国大使杰拉尔·阿罗德（Gérard Araud）指出，俄罗斯对选举的干预和操纵如果不加以遏制，有可能给西方民主国家造成“生存威胁 ” 。	According to Gérard Araud, France’s ambassador to the United States, Russian electoral interference and manipulation, if left unchecked, could pose an “existential threat” to Western democracies.
格林斯潘认为，正是二十世纪九十年代的互联网繁荣才“最终在大范围基础上验证了熊彼得的创新性破坏的理论 ” 。	As Greenspan notes, it was the dot-com boom of the 1990’s that “finally gave broad currency to Schumpeter’s idea of creative destruction.”
在玻利维亚，总统莫拉莱斯的2009年新宪法禁止三度连选连任，但如今宪法法院批准他连任，指出玻利维亚国已经“重建 ” 。	In Bolivia, President Evo Morales’s new 2009 constitution banned reelection to a third consecutive term, but now the Constitutional Court has allowed him to run, arguing that the Bolivian state has been “refounded.”
出口活动需要的具体规则、基础设施、技能和技术掌握往往与创造当地大部分就业机会的非贸易活动相比有着显著的区别。	The specific rules, infrastructure, skills, and technological mastery that export activities require tend to be different from those needed for the non-tradable activities that usually generate the bulk of a place’s employment.
发达国家公民对“建制 ” — —包括经济“专家 ” 、 主流政治领导人、主要跨国公司 — — 感到失望，越来越多的人指责它们是经济艰难的罪魁祸首。	Advanced-country citizens are frustrated with an “establishment” – including economic “experts,” mainstream political leaders, and dominant multinational companies – which they increasingly blame for their economic travails.
所以货币市场基金都因此遭到了质疑，许多投资者闻风撤资 — — 仅仅一个星期内就赎回了3000多亿美元。	All money-market funds then became suspect, and many investors fled – withdrawing one-third of a trillion dollars in a single week.
他的信条代表了产业和金融过度繁荣时期的哲学，那一轮过度繁荣早已随20世纪80年代末垃圾债券市场崩盘与储蓄贷款合作社危机（Savings & Loan crisis）走到了末路。	His creed became the ethos of a decade of corporate and financial-sector excesses that ended in the late 1980’s collapse of the junk-bond market and the Savings & Loan crisis.
2011年约23%的地方卫生部门反映公共卫生应急计划数量锐减甚至消失。 还有15%反映2012年也有过类似的削减开支。	Some 23% of local health departments reported that public health preparedness programs were reduced or even eliminated in 2011, while a further 15% reported similar cuts in 2012.
戈尔巴乔夫实际上只是恢复一种历史悠久的趋向。 在此之前我们俄罗斯人再次相信人民为了成就国家的伟大应该愿意放弃他们的自由，这个国家赢得了战争并发射了人造地球卫星。	As before the advent of Gorbachev – indeed, restoring a centuries-old tendency – Russians yet again believe that the people should be willing to forfeit their freedoms for the sake of the greatness of the state, which wins wars and launches Sputniks.
在像美国这样的国家，在过去25年里，中产阶级从全球化中得到的好处非常少，所以贸易政策有非常大的压力要对此提供一些补偿。	In countries like the US, where the middle class has reaped few of the benefits of globalization in the last quarter-century, trade policy will be under severe pressure to provide some redress.
与诺贝尔奖获得者若泽·萨拉马戈的评论恰好相反，以军对加沙地区的袭击在任何方面都无法和纳粹奥斯维辛集中营相提并论。	Contrary to what the Nobel Prize-winning author José Saramago once said, the Israeli army’s attacks in Gaza are not comparable in any way to Auschwitz.
事实上，这一重新解释只不过是顺水推舟：目前日本自卫队可以护卫保卫日本的美国军舰，但仍禁止发动进攻或参与多边军事行动。	In fact, the reinterpretation amounts to little more than a tweak: Japanese forces can now shield an American warship defending Japan, but they remain prohibited from initiating offensive attacks or participating in multilateral military operations.
美国政府非但没有中止其副总统拜登访问北京之旅以示不满，反而建议商业航班尊重中国单方面宣布的防空识别区。	Instead of demonstrating its disapproval by postponing Vice President Joe Biden’s trip to Beijing, the US government advised commercial airlines to respect China’s self-declared ADIZ.
欧盟委员会应该通过所谓的“六部立法权力 ” （ Six-Pack powers ） ， 给予欧元区集团一切需要的支持。	The European Commission should provide it with whatever help it needs through the so-called Six-Pack powers.
事实上，自冷战结束以来，世界从未面临如此紧张和令人担忧的环境，欧洲和中东因为大国对话破裂而走向流血。	Indeed, the world has not witnessed such a tense and fraught environment since the Cold War’s end, with bloodshed in Europe and the Middle East coming against the backdrop of a breakdown in dialogue between major powers.
对于欧盟与俄罗斯和土耳其的关系（以及俄土两国关系）的问题，成员国需要形成一致的承认所有各方利益的政策。	For issues such as EU relations with Russia and Turkey (and these two countries’ relations with each other), member states need to agree on a policy that recognizes the interests of all.
2002年又订立了《蒙特利尔共识 》 ， 承诺采取具体措施使最贫困国家得到的援助增加3倍，以便实现对外援助占发达国家国民生产总值0.7%的国际目标。	And in 2002, they agreed on the Monterrey Consensus, pledging concrete efforts to triple aid flows to the poorest in order to reach the international goal for foreign assistance of 0.7% of rich-world GNP.
在美国，人们已经登录RateMDs.com和vitals.com等网站为自己的医生打分，HealthGrades.com还提供医生和医院的第三方评估。	In the United States, people are already rating their own doctors at sites such as RateMDs.com and vitals.com; third-party doctor and hospital ratings are available at HealthGrades.com.
结果令人刮目相看：过去十年中巴西将亚马逊森林被砍伐的平均速度降低了60%以上，吸收了约36亿吨的二氧化碳，贡献之大超过其他任何国家。	The results were impressive: Brazil reduced the average rate of Amazon deforestation by over 60% over the last decade, absorbing about 3.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide, more than any other country.
社会学家安东尼·吉登斯所谓的“梦游式情景”几乎丝毫不差地在英国上演，英国在从未对所涉利益进行真正诚实和明智辩论的情况下决意退出欧盟。	Following literally what the sociologist Anthony Giddens called the “sleepwalking scenario,” the UK decided to abandon the EU without a truly honest and informed debate about what was at stake.
好莱坞女性或许已经开启了呼吁工作场所平等的全球事业，但对于我们这些在不那么有诱惑力的环境中工作的女性来说，工作环境革命也同样重要。	The women of Hollywood may have initiated what has become a global call for equality at work, but the workplace revolution is no less significant for those of us who walk on less colorful carpets.
与此同时，发展中国家可能要采取临时保护措施，促进当地私有部门和“稚嫩工业”的发展，这可以让他们在自由化的道路上逐渐扩大生产规模。	At the same time, developing countries may need to promote local private sectors and “infant industries” through temporary protectionist measures, which would help them to upgrade their output on the road to liberalization.
要计算中国在经历了35年前所未有的经济增长之后还剩下多少后发优势，我们需要考察期技术和产业发展水平与高收入国家的差距。	To calculate how much of a latecomer advantage China has after 35 years of unprecedented growth, one needs to look at the gap between its levels of technological and industrial development and those of high-income countries.
当关于这点的理论设想层出不穷之时，必须在解释这类电子-电子理论的体系（甚至包括黑洞）上取得新的理论突破。	While ideas about this abound, new theoretical breakthroughs most likely will be needed to develop the machinery required to solve such electron-electron theories, perhaps even involving black holes.
巴基斯坦人民党的政治对手巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟（Nawaz）则在旁遮普省议会赢得了多数席位，进而控制了该国最大的省份。	The PPP’s political rival, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) won a majority of seats in the Punjab provincial assembly, giving it control of the country’s largest province.
(布什对于俄国的威胁不以为然，当俄军坦克开进格鲁吉亚的时候，他在北京几乎拥抱普京极大地表现出这一点。 这或许让克里姆林宫认为他们可以入侵格鲁吉亚而逍遥法外。	(Bush’s inattentiveness to this Russian threat – dramatically illustrated by his literal embrace of Putin in Beijing as Russian tanks rolled into Georgia – may have led the Kremlin to think it could get away with its invasion.)
随后，罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）和托马斯·萨金特（Thomas Sargent）等“新古典”经济学家证明，如果人们明白了通胀被操纵以形成市场乐观，那么货币当局的行动将不再有影响。	Later, “new classical” economists like Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent demonstrated that once people understand that inflation is being manipulated to generate market optimism, the monetary authorities’ actions lose their impact.
这种方法还挑起城市管理者和环保主义者之间的矛盾，后者要求限制兴修水利，以缓解对森林和流域造成的压力。	It also puts city managers at odds with environmentalists, who campaign for restrictions on development to ease pressure on forests and watersheds.
但是在英国，即使是中产阶级穆斯林也变得隔离于社会，而且，与欧洲穆斯林不同的是，美国的穆斯林穷人并不表达隔离之意或者对基地组织表示同情。	Yet even middle-class Muslims in Britain become alienated, and, unlike the Muslim poor in Europe, poor Muslims in America don’t express alienation or sympathy with al-Qaeda.
这些乐观派的幻想受到了供给派的挑战。 供给派认为应该对中国低迷的国有部门采取休克疗法，并立即将中国尚不发达的资本市场融入如今动荡不已的全球金融体系。	The optimists’ unreality is rivaled by that of supply-siders, who would apply shock therapy to China’s slumping state sector and immediately integrate the country’s underdeveloped capital markets into today’s turbulent global financial system.
伦敦—我已经有四年多没有关注国际金融和经济预测了，但在我在这一领域全职工作的30多年里所学到的经验仍在影响我看待世界的方式。	LONDON – I have been out of the world of international finance and economic forecasting for more than four years, but much of what I learned during my 30 years working full-time in the field still influences how I view the world.
9/11事件后，全世界都对美国对塔利班的军事打击表示理解和同情，而美国入侵与9/11袭击毫无瓜葛的伊拉克将世界人民的同情挥霍殆尽。	In the aftermath of 9/11, there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for America’s military response against the Taliban.
其次，我们在中期目标的指导下保持着稳定的货币政策，避免了对若干指数变化做出过于简单的判断和机械的反应。	Second, we kept a steady hand, guided by our medium-term orientation, while eschewing oversimplified diagnostics and mechanistic reactions to a few indicators.
这是自安德鲁·杰克逊（Andrew Jackson）时代以来，白宫首次积极地“民主化”美国领土上的最高职务，并象征性地邀请普通男性和女性到白宫做客。	For the first time since the days of Andrew Jackson, the White House is aggressively “democratizing” the highest office in the land, and symbolically inviting in the common man – and now the common woman.
冷战期间有40年美苏最高领导人经常举行高风险、高级别的会议，而在冷战结束大约30年后的今天，峰会又重新开始流行。	Some 30 years after the end of the Cold War, a four-decade era often punctuated by high-stakes, high-level encounters between American presidents and their Soviet counterparts, summits are back in fashion.
在中国，2013年的一次政策峰会发布了GBD项目的结果，引起了关于空气污染对中国人的致死影响的关注。	In China, the results of the GBD project, launched at a policy summit in 2013, raised awareness about the deadly impact of air pollution on the country’s population.
一些国家不会因想象民族尊严受到侵害而感到威胁 — — 处于种种历史原因，它们认为自己高其他民族一等。	Some nations do not feel threatened by imaginary insults to national dignity – for various historical reasons, they believe themselves to be superior to others.
许多对外交持怀疑态度的共和党人 — — 这些人将博尔顿视为领袖 — — 普遍不赞成特朗普与金正恩会面，认为与独裁者对话是浪费时间，最终会被独裁者所利用。	Many within the Republican Party who are skeptical of diplomacy, of whom Bolton is a leader, have balked at Trump’s decision to meet with Kim, arguing that talks with dictators are a waste of time that ultimately play into autocrats’ hands.
否则它们将面临与诺基亚类似的命运 — — 先是被一家科技公司（苹果）脱媒，然后被另一家（微软）收购。	Otherwise, they could face a fate similar to Nokia, which was disintermediated by one tech company (Apple) and acquired by another (Microsoft).
美国癌症协会（American Cancer Society ） 、 美国心脏协会（American Heart Association）以及国家卫生研究局（National Institutes of Health）等基于疾病的研究机构就是显著的例子。	The American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association, as well as the disease-based research institutes of the National Institutes of Health, are notable examples.
与此同时，政治建制派越来越脱离群众，一如两次大战期间的欧洲 — — 当时，这导致了法西斯主义和民粹主义极权统治的兴起。	At the same time, its political establishment has become increasingly disconnected from the public, much as it did in interwar Europe – a development that fueled the rise of fascism and populist authoritarianism.
尽管取得了令人瞩目的崛起，但2011年中国的人均收入只有10,057美元（经购买力平价调整 ） ， 位居世界第99位，只有美国人均收入49,782美元的五分之一。	Despite its remarkable rise, China’s per capita income, at $10,057 (adjusted for purchasing power) in 2011, ranks 99th in the world – roughly one-fifth of US per capita income of $49,782.
大多数人认为它为巩固和合法化一个国家对一群人的统治 — — 不管这群人是由共同的语言、文化还是种族所确定 — — 提供了一个途径。	Most agree that it offered a way to consolidate and legitimize a state’s rule over a group of people, whether defined by a common language, culture, or ethnicity.
而俄国人正好相反，他们继续强调包括军事力量在内的“硬实力 ” ， 因为他们明白：自己身处一个危机四伏的世界之中，且没有靠山可供求助。	Russians, on the other hand, emphasize their “hard power,” including military force, because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind.
事情是明摆着的，我们正在处于使欧盟政治孤立，成为一个成功但却外交中立的关税联盟，以及成为一群难以驾驭，没有远见的领导人的危险中。	As things stand, we are in danger of making Europe politically irrelevant, a successful customs union with a Swissified foreign policy and a group of fractious, vision-free leaders.
最重要的是，美国和中国应当避免激发对各自实力和意图的过度恐惧，因为对冲突的预期本身也可能成为冲突的导火索。	Most importantly, the US and China should avoid developing exaggerated fears of each other’s capacities and intentions. The expectation of conflict can itself become a cause of conflict.
如果遇到了冲突 — — 一方是潜在理性生命体的当然利益（此时它甚至尚未形成意识 ） ， 另一方是已成为理性妇女的切身利益 — — 那么我们应该毫无例外地偏向于妇女的利益。	If it comes to a clash between the supposed interests of potentially rational but not yet even conscious beings and the vital interests of actually rational women, we should give preference to the women every time.
但莱希死后雅罗斯瓦夫·卡钦斯基的民粹主义便不再受到控制，后者通过有效挟持中间派选民，成功地让新法案对法律与正义党有利。	But Jarosław Kaczyński, whose populism was once held in check by his brother, shaped this new legislation in ways that are politically favorable to PiS, which he leads, by effectively taking centrist voters hostage.
然而约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）并不认同这一观点 ， “ 将生产能力的巨大膨胀视为贫困和衰退的必然前奏是非常愚蠢的 ， ” 凯恩斯在1920年代经济繁荣转向大萧条后的1931年写到。	“It seems an extraordinary imbecility that this wonderful outburst of productive energy should be the prelude to impoverishment and depression,” Keynes wrote in 1931, after the boom years of the 1920s had given way to the Great Depression.
如果欧洲人把康德的“绝对命令 ” — —比如“己所不欲勿施于人 ” — —置诸脑后，那么他们在发现欧盟陷入停滞或者内部分裂之时就别那么大惊小怪了。	If Europeans disregard Kant’s categorical imperative – i.e., don’t do to others what you don’t want others to do to you – they should not be astonished if the European Union comes to a standstill or even implodes.
旨在增加经济体灵活性的改革总是艰难的 — — 在增长疲软的时期更是如此 — — 因为这需要消除既得利益的短期保护以换取长期繁荣。	Reforms aimed at increasing an economy's flexibility are always hard – and even more so at a time of weak growth – because they require eliminating protections for vested interests in the short term for the sake of greater long-term prosperity.
阿尔伯塔 — — 临近二十世纪时，为人类在无神论社会主义和腐败自由主义间的选择而备感神伤的教皇利奥十三世委托天主教知识分子设计一种更好的方式。	ALBERTA – As the twentieth century neared, Pope Leo XIII, grieving for humanity’s choice between atheistic socialism and venal liberalism, commissioned Catholic intellectuals to devise a better solution.
在去年7月庆祝美国独立230周年时，布什总统强调“美国革命战争”的爱国者们坚信人生来平等，拥有不可剥夺的权利。	In commemorating the 230th anniversary of America’s independence last July, President George W. Bush noted that the patriots of the Revolutionary War believed that all men are created equal, and with inalienable rights.
这些趋势都清楚地表明中国确有机会成为全球药品研发的主要力量，而且中国定期出现突破性创新的时点可能将很快到来。	These trends clearly indicate that China has a real opportunity to become a major force in global pharmaceuticals research, and that there will soon come a time when breakthrough innovation occurs in China on a regular basis.
结果可能是工资提高，形成更多新岗位 — — 全世界范围内高达3—3.65亿个 — — 原因在于支出增加，其中新兴经济体获益最多。	The result could be higher wages that contribute to the creation of more new jobs – 300-365 million worldwide – as spending increases, with emerging economies gaining the most.
双方关于国际安全问题的观点也日趋一致，特别是在涉华问题上，这毫无疑问推动了美国国会和总统奥巴马政府授予安倍国会演讲的荣誉。	The two sides’ increasingly similar views on international security issues as well, particularly where China is concerned, no doubt also contributed to the decision by the US Congress and President Barack Obama’s administration to honor Abe.
此外，尽管美国过去几年大幅增加了在欧洲的防务开支，但应当记住的是，那里的绝大多数美国军队和军事设施实际都集中在从印度到南非的战略弧。	Moreover, although the US has increased its defense outlays in Europe substantially over the past few years, it is worth remembering that most US forces and facilities there are actually focused on the geostrategic arc from India to South Africa.
印度对外事务部长穆克杰(Pranab Mukherjee)最近说 ， “ 印度对气候变化非常关注，但是，我们不得不从消除贫困以使所有的印度人都过上有尊严的生活的紧迫任务的角度，来看待这个问题 。 ”	India’s External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee recently said, “India is very concerned about climate change, but we have to see the issue in the perspective of our imperative to remove poverty so that all Indians can live a life of dignity.”
针对认识不足的行动很可能造成一些抑郁病人被误诊为双相障碍。 这些病人往往焦虑、不安和/或易怒，并抱怨有失眠和“思绪澎湃”的症状。	The campaign against under-recognition has probably resulted in some anxious, agitated, and/or irritable depressed patients who complain of insomnia and “racing thoughts” being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder.
英国国防开支作为政府全部开支的一部分，已经从1998年占全部政府开支的7.8%下降到2006年的6.1 % 。	As a share of total government spending, defense expenditure has fallen from 7.8% in 1998 to 6.1% in 2006.
现在，形势已经清楚，近一半在6月8日的英国大选中投票的人受够了梅。 梅的保守党多数地位也在选举中消失殆尽，结果是形成了一个悬浮议会（任何政党都没能获得多数 ） 。	Now, it is clear, almost half of those who voted in the United Kingdom’s general election on June 8 have had enough of May, whose Conservative majority was wiped out at the polls, producing a hung parliament (with no majority for any party).
在奥地利和法国，不信任欧洲的反移民民粹主义政党已经获得了足够的支持，拥有了掌握权力的真正机会，意大利更加左翼的五星运动情况也非常类似。	In Austria and France, Euroskeptic, anti-immigrant populist parties have gained enough support to have a real chance of winning power, as has Italy’s more left-wing Five Star Movement.
1979年伊朗伊斯兰革命的模式 — — 将妇女视为二等公民 — — 被频繁视为如今由伊斯兰党派执政的阿拉伯国家的一大威胁。	The model of Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, which imposed second-class citizenship on women, is frequently cited as a threat in Arab countries now ruled by Islamist parties.
由于许多最好的新思想和创新都来自小公司而不是老牌大型企业，当前持续的信用紧缩必将导致长期增长成本的产生。	Since many of the best ideas and innovations come from small companies rather than large, established firms, the ongoing credit contraction will inevitably have long-term growth costs.
参与这项研究的德娜·布拉瓦塔说 ， “ 项目开始时，我们都认为很可能找到有机食品优于传统食品的证据 。 ”	“When we began this project,” said Dena Bravata, one of the researchers, “we thought that there would likely be some findings that would support the superiority of organics over conventional food.”
确定的是，以职业喜剧演员格里洛（Beppe Grillo）为首的反欧元政党至少将在意大利大选中赢得20%的选票。	What is not uncertain is that an anti-euro party, run by a professional comedian, Beppe Grillo, will gain at least 20% of the Italian vote.
BCHD的项目并无新奇之处：面向儿童的步行上学计划；面向本地餐厅的健康减食计划（通过该地区的蓝区工程（Blue Zones Project）实现 ） ； 面向老年人的社会支持；运动课；免疫计划，诸如此类。	The BCHD’s programs are not novel: walk-to-school programs for children, healthy menus (through the district’s Blue Zones Project) for local restaurants, social support for older people, exercise classes, immunization programs, and the like.
如果我们把这一预测外推 — — 没有迹象表明美国会回到2008年之前的增长路径上去 — — 股票收益实际年折现率按6%计算，那么未来成本将是人均150,000美元。	If we project that forward – with nothing visible to restore the US to its pre-2008 growth path – at the annual real discount rate of 6% that we apply to equity earnings, the future costs are $150,000 per capita.
甚至在东亚经济体中TFP表现最为出色的香港在1960年到1990年期间的平均年TFP增长率也只有2.4 % 。	Even Hong Kong – the East Asian economy with the best TFP performance – registered only 2.4% average annual TFP growth from 1960 to 1990.
投资银行年轻才俊将面临千载难逢的良机，设计出更具参与性的风险资本形式 — — 比如新出现的大众集资网站 — — 以刺激创新性小企业的成长。	Young investment bankers, for their part, have a great opportunity to devise more participatory forms of venture capital – embodied in the new crowd-funding Web sites – to spur the growth of innovative new small businesses.
纽约-在最近举行的对格鲁吉亚的捐款人会议上，捐款意向滚滚不断，总计达到了4 5亿美元-大约每个格鲁吉亚公民就能获得10 00美元。	NEW YORK – At the recent donors’ meeting on Georgia, aid pledges rolled in, totaling $4.5 billion – about $1,000 per citizen of Georgia.
除了投资银行和券商之外，现代金融还有公共和政府部门的维度，最近的金融危机明确地显示，这一维度也需要推倒重建。	Beyond investment banks and brokerage houses, modern finance has a public and governmental dimension, which clearly needs reinventing in the wake of the recent financial crisis.
“可预防死亡”在中低收入国家仍然司空见惯，这一事实表明我们的医疗体系低劣不堪或者资源不足，而不意味着我们缺少医学知识。	The fact that “preventable deaths” remain common in low- and middle-income countries is a symptom of broken or under-resourced health-care delivery systems, not a lack of medical know-how.
其实美国情报部门早就收集了许多关于基地组织的信息，但美国却没能把这些来自诸多情报部门的情报进行系统整理。	There was a good deal of information about Al Qaeda in the American intelligence system, but the US was unable to process coherently the information that its various agencies had gathered.
作为少数民族的一员，一名西班牙年轻人这样说 ： “ 我在街上走路时，会担心警察因为我的肤色、我的口音和我走路的姿势而叫住我，查问我的证件 。 ”	A young Spanish man who is a member of an ethnic minority group put it this way: “I worry when I go on the street that the police will stop me and ask me for my papers because of the color of my skin, by my tone of skin, by my way of walking.”
大约有500,000万人在1915年最后七个月中惨遭杀戮，大部分幸存者被驱逐到了叙利亚的沙漠地带，在那里，他们不是饥饿至死就是疾病缠身而亡。	Approximately 500,000 were killed in the last seven months of 1915, with the majority of the survivors deported to desert areas in Syria, where they died from either starvation or disease.
官员必须抛弃短视和政治正确性， 改善美国老化的基础设施，改革其教育和移民制���，追求长期财政整合。	Officials will have to put aside short-term motives and party orthodoxy to bolster America’s aging infrastructure, reform its education and immigration systems, and pursue long-term fiscal consolidation.
我在巴基斯坦长大，知道对于像我母亲这样的受过教育的家长来说，了解哪些药物和药品可以信任是至关重要的。	Growing up in Pakistan, I realized how vital it was for my mother, like any educated parent, to know which drugs and pharmacies could be trusted.
事实上，苏布拉曼尼恩最具争议性的观点就是中国在经济霸权方面其实已经超过了美国 — — 只是我们还未能意识到这个新现实而已。	Indeed, Subramanian’s most provocative argument is that China has already surpassed the US in terms of economic dominance – but we have not yet woken up to this new reality.
美国人口只占全世界的4.4 % ， 占世界产出的比重也在下降，它可能沉迷于主宰全球的幻觉，发动新军备竞赛和采取保护主义贸易政策。	With just 4.4% of the world’s population and a falling share of world output, the US might try to hang on to its delusion of global dominance through a new arms race and protectionist trade policies.
鲸鱼不能被少受痛苦地杀死，因此它们体型太庞大。 即便用带炸药的捕鲸叉，也很难击中鲸鱼身体的正确部位。	Whales cannot be humanely killed – they are too large, and even with an explosive harpoon, it is difficult to hit the whale in the right spot.
在透明国际的《2010全球清廉指数》中，乌克兰得分为2.4（打分范围为0—10，0表示高度腐败，10表示高度清廉 ） 。	On Transparency International´s Corruption Perceptions Index 2010, Ukraine scored 2.4 on a scale from zero (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean).
当美国人11月进入投票站决定将选票投给谁时，他们考虑的是性别和枪支的“文化战争”的问题呢，还是是否能付得起房屋的抵押贷款呢？	When they get into the polling booth in November, will Americans vote on “culture wars” issues – sex and guns – or on the basis of whether they can afford to pay their mortgages?
欧盟的主要设计者之一是法国外交官兼经济学家让·莫内，二战期间，他作为欧洲盟军谈判代表在华盛顿呆了很长时间。	One of the EU’s main architects, Jean Monnet, a French diplomat and economist, spent much of World War II in Washington, DC, as a negotiator for the European allies.
随着2018年的深入，商界领袖和市场参与者应该 — — 并且毫无疑问将会 — — 牢记我们正在日益靠近为今天的复苏付出代价的日子。	As 2018 progresses, business leaders and market participants should – and undoubtedly will – bear in mind that we are moving ever closer to the date when payment for today’s recovery will fall due.
2014年12月，土耳其成为G-20主席国，自此以来，我们通过集体行动确保包容性强健增长的方针受到了G-20组织各成员国的支持。	Since Turkey assumed the presidency of the G-20 in December 2014, our approach toward ensuring inclusive and robust growth through collective action has enjoyed the support of the organization’s members.
但是作为一名生活在非洲大陆最重要的发展伙伴之一中国的肯尼亚人，我看到有一个衡量标准导致天平向津巴布韦倾斜：那就是这个国家与我第二故乡的关系。	But as a Kenyan living in China, one of the African continent’s most important development partners, I see one metric that tips the scale in Zimbabwe’s favor: its relationship with my adopted home.
欧元债券可以降低欧盟两个受困大国的借贷成本，也可以让德国和欧盟状况良好的北欧国家的纳税人免于为南欧成员国再次掏钱施救。	Eurobonds would cut borrowing costs for the European Union’s two large troubled members. And it would spare German and other taxpayers from the EU’s solvent northern countries from having to fund yet another bailout of a southern member state.
并且差距在继续扩大 — — 2015年上半年服务业活动同比增长8.4 % ， 远超制造业和建筑业的6.1 % 。	And the gap is continuing to widen – services activity grew 8.4% year on year in the first half of 2015, far outstripping the 6.1% growth in manufacturing and construction.
认识到治理随发展而得到改善，国际社会就会追求直接促进发展的改革而不是充其量也许只能带来微小间接影响的宽泛日程，从而获得更好的表现。	Recognizing that governance improves with development, the international community would be better served by pursuing reforms that directly advance development, instead of a broad agenda that may have, at best, a small indirect impact.
随着印度竞选活动升温，人们只能希望那些突发奇想 — — 以及常常随之而来的煽动性言论 — — 不会点燃一次冲突。	As India’s election campaigns heat up, one can only hope that those whims – and the incendiary rhetoric that often accompanies them – do not ignite a conflagration.
巴勒斯坦人希望建立独立的国家，且必须以耶路撒冷作为首都，同时以色列必须停止在自1967年“六日战争”以来所占领的土地上扩大定居点建设。	The Palestinians want an independent state, but on the condition that they secure Jerusalem as its capital, and that Israel ceases to expand settlements on territory that it has occupied since the 1967 Six-Day War.
新加坡 — — 飓风佛罗伦萨上周袭击了美国东南部，这一系列极端天气事件已经提升了人们对灾难准备的预期。	SINGAPORE – Hurricane Florence, which smashed into the southeastern United States last week, is the latest in a string of extreme weather events that has raised expectations for disaster preparedness.
或者，它们不会改变人手、破坏供应链，而是想办法将利润注册在低税地区 — — 常用手段是将总部功能搬出。	Or, rather than transferring personnel and disrupting supply chains, they may find a way to register profits in a lower-tax jurisdiction – typically by moving some head office functions there.
希腊把港口卖给中国人，德国追求增加欧洲对俄能源依赖的Nord Stream 2管道工程，这些做法有什么可以指责的呢？	How can one blame Greece for selling ports to the Chinese, while Germany pursues the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will increase Europe’s energy dependency on Russia?
但我们仍需就开辟充满活力的新低碳经济道路做出重要决策，上述经济必须能够支撑长期快速发展和日益繁荣的全球民众。	Yet important decisions remain to be made in charting a course toward a new and dynamic low-carbon economy, one capable of supporting a fast-growing and increasingly prosperous global population in the long term.
事实上，由于所有未来税收收入之和（贴现到现在）必须不小于所有未来支出与国民债务之和，因此保持税收水平相对较低的唯一方法只有控制支出。	Indeed, because the sum of all future tax revenues (discounted to today) must cover the sum of all future spending plus the national debt, the only way to keep taxes relatively low is to control spending.
霍尔丹援引了一组显著的统计数据：1945年，一般投资者持美国股票的平均时间为4年。 到2000年，平均持股的时间已降到8个月；到2008年，平均持股时间为2个月了。	That absence of accountability, in turn, has contributed to the vertiginous rise in senior executives’ compensation and, in financial firms, to a shift away from shareholder returns and towards large payouts to insiders.
但是，在最近的谈判中，这一分歧并不是主要障碍，因为哈马斯仍然处于边缘地位 — — 既没有参与，也没有试图搅局。	In the latest round of negotiations, however, this division has not been a major obstacle, because Hamas remained on the sidelines – neither participating nor seeking to play a spoiler role.
美国长期债券（如十年期国债）收益率与过去十年通货膨胀呈现出高正相关性（1913年以来为70 % ） 。	US long-term bond yields, such as the ten-year Treasury yield, are highly positively correlated (70% since 1913) with the previous ten years’ inflation.
该合同将以标准普尔及蔡斯席勒住房价格指数进行结算，该指数源于我和同事蔡斯近20年前开发研究得出的学术成果。	The contracts will be settled on the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, which developed out of academic work that my colleague Karl Case and I pioneered almost twenty years ago.
在这个临界点上，当给我们带来如此繁荣的化石燃料开始导致我们走向毁灭时，也只有科技创新能把我们带上更好的道路。	At this critical point, when the fossil fuels that have brought us so much prosperity could lead to our demise, it is again technological innovation that can steer us onto a better path.
前三个G20国家首脑会议 — — 华盛顿，伦敦和匹兹堡会议 — — 都因推动了多边主义和全球合作而被人们铭记。	The first three G-20 summits of chiefs of state, in Washington, London, and Pittsburgh, will be remembered for advancing multilateralism and coordinated global action.
继续在伊朗开展业务的外国公司现在面临制裁威胁，而处理交易的银行则很可能会失去进入美国金融系统的机会。	Foreign firms that continue to conduct business in Iran now face the threat of sanctions, and banks that process transactions risk losing access to the US financial system.
普林斯顿大学的扬-维尔纳·米勒（Jan-Werner Mueller）在他的《竞争民主》一书中所论述的那样，选举在十九世纪末的扩张将这两大原则合并在了一起，最终形成了一个不稳定的化合物。	As Princeton University’s Jan-Werner Mueller argues in his book Contesting Democracy, combining the two principles, by extending the franchise at the end of the nineteenth century, made for an unstable compound.
发展并不是解决暴力问题的灵丹妙药，并且可能会制造它自己的悲伤情绪，尤其是在没有充分考虑它可能给社会带来的突然变化。	Development is no miracle solution to violence, and may create its own set of grievances – particularly when done without regard to the abrupt changes it brings to societies.
另一方面，经济学家泰勒·柯文（Tyler Cowen）和罗伯特·戈登（Robert Gordon）认为问题出在供给端。	The economists Tyler Cowen and Robert Gordon, on the other hand, argue that the problem is on the supply side.
雇主们也有了招工和评估劳动者的新工具，让他们可以轻易替换那些低技能劳动者，因此可能在短期内让收入不均状况进一步恶化。	Now that employers have new tools for recruitment and assessment, they may find low-skilled workers easier to replace, potentially worsening income inequality in the short run.
此外，在一个相对高增长的经济体中，只要这些债务被用于资助投资，无论是产生高回报或创造了价值超过债务的资产，那么高债务水平显然并不一定是个问题。	Moreover, in a relatively high-growth economy, ostensibly high debt levels are not necessarily a problem, as long as that debt is being used to fund investments that either yield high returns or create assets worth more than the debt.
现在，全世界正在携手朝新的全球发展议程努力，我们希望这一做法能够得到普及，激励其他国家政府更加致力于高质量的人道主义纾困和可持续发展融资。	Now that the world is working together on a new global development agenda, we hope this practice will spread and inspire other governments to move more toward high-quality funding for humanitarian relief and sustainable development.
换句话说，在某个低水平的充足度之上，人们的幸福水平受绝对收入规模的影响程度远小于与参照群体相比的相对收入水平。	In other words, above a low level of sufficiency, peoples’ happiness levels are determined much less by their absolute income than by their income relative to some reference group.
全球新兴市场经济体情况要好一些，但是，尽管它们潜在产出的基本趋势增长率比发达经济体高得多，却仍然不可能做到周期性脱钩。	The world’s emerging-market economies are in better shape; but, while their underlying trend growth in potential output is much higher than that of the advanced economies, there is no cyclical de-coupling.
对此威廉·克莱恩（William Cline）试图为银行资本的适当水平提供一个理论基础而撰写的《银行的正确平衡》一书为我们缓解了焦虑。	So it was a relief to encounter William Cline’s book The Right Balance for Banks, which attempts to produce a rationale for the appropriate level of bank capital.
近几十年来，国际和地方合作已成功将非洲的疟疾死亡人数降低了60 % 、 几乎完全根除了小儿麻痹症，并延长了数以百万计感染艾滋病毒/艾滋病的非洲人的生命。	In recent decades, international and local cooperation have reduced Africa’s malaria deaths by 60% , pushed polio to the brink of eradication, and extended the lives of millions of Africans infected with HIV/AIDS.
这部电影使用一些生动的图表、画面以及其他信息，有力地阐明了人类的二氧化碳排放造成全球气候变暖，或者至少是促进气候变暖，并且大力呼吁处理这一问题是当务之急。	Using some remarkable graphs, images, and other information, the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming, or, at the very least, contributing to it, and that we must urgently address the issue.
总的来说，越多人使用一种毒品，那么滥用者的数目也会随之增加（这是基于一种合理假设：全体吸食者中必定存在有特定比例的滥用者，其数量随总吸食者的增加而增加 ） 。	In general, the more people who use a drug, the larger the number of problem users there will be (on the reasonable assumption that problem users comprise a fixed proportion of all users).
政策中心的这一转移已有实际体现。 例如，奥巴马总统下令派遣2500名海军陆战队员到澳大利亚北部的某基地进行训练。	President Barack Obama’s decision to rotate 2,500 US Marines through a base in northern Australia is an early sign of that pivot.
简而言之，这种短期的紧缩行为并不会导致长期性的负面效应，而且紧缩在某种程度上是灾后复原所必不可少的，事实证明，其带来的长期好处不仅持久，而且令人震惊。	In short, there were no lasting negative effects from the short-term dose of austerity, and, to the extent that austerity was essential to post-crisis healing, the long-term benefits have proven to be both enduring and astounding.
但是，正如联合国声明 — — 以及围绕是否应该通过这项声明的长期争论 — — 所表明的那样，科学争论并非处于那些围绕着有关“人类生活”开端问题的国内和国际争论的中心。	But, as the UN declaration – and the long debate surrounding its adoption – illustrate, scientific arguments are not at the center of national and international debates, which revolve around questions concerning the beginning of “human life.”
中国共产党治下的中国曾是一个赤贫的巨人，但在三十年的不断富裕之后，中国如今正向全世界推销自己的发展 — — 以及文明 — — 模式。	The Communist Party of China used to rule a destitute power. But, having become much richer over the past three decades, China is now proposing to the world its own model of development – and, indeed, of civilization.
巴西正与遍布南大西洋两岸的邻国密切合作为保护海洋避免对抗及核武器而加强南大西洋和平合作区（ZPCSA）的建设。	With our neighbors on both shores of the South Atlantic, Brazil is working closely to strengthen the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic (ZPCSA), which aims to keep the ocean free from rivalries foreign to it and from nuclear weapons.
比如，许多央行现在推荐运用“宏观审慎”工具来管理经济中的系统风险 — — 这反过来让它们能够保持利率“更低水平更长时间 ” 。	For example, many central bankers are now recommending the use of “macroprudential” instruments to manage systemic risks in the economy – which, in turn, will allow them to keep interest rates “lower for longer.”
但如果要真正遏制欧洲所面临的民族主义威胁，德国必须与马克隆合作来应对那些导致众多选民背弃欧盟的经济挑战。	But if the nationalist threat to Europe is truly to be contained, Germany will have to work with Macron to address the economic challenges that have driven so many voters to reject the European Union.
在9月G20峰会公报中，G20集团领导人一再提及通过基础设施投资刺激世界增长的措施，并提出要进行更多货币、财政和结构性政策协调。	In the communiqué released after September’s G20 summit, the group’s leaders repeatedly mentioned steps to boost world growth through infrastructure investment, and argued for more coordination among monetary, fiscal, and structural policies.
必须坚决捍��公众言论及和平集会的权利，这既是为了那些自觉被主流社会边缘化的团体，也是为了那些对巴勒斯坦、车臣和伊拉克民众所遭受的不公正待遇而义愤填膺的全体民众和大多数欧洲公民。	The right to public speech and peaceful assembly must be defended for those who feel marginalized and indignant at what they – and most Europeans – view as injustices committed against the Palestinians, the Chechens, and the Iraqis.
美国的美元负债随时都有可能达到临界点，如果担惊受怕的投资者因为寻找其他价值储藏手段而引起不可逆转的下降螺旋的话。	America’s dollar liabilities could reach a tipping point at any time, if skittish investors, seeking an alternative store of value, precipitate an irreversible downward spiral.
委内瑞拉危机（1998年 ） 、 巴西危机（1999年）和阿根廷危机（2001年）相继爆发，导致查韦斯、卢拉和基什内尔当选总统。	Crises in Venezuela (1998), Brazil (1999), and Argentina (2001) followed, leading to the election of Chávez, Lula, and Kirchner.
几乎所有与会代表都赞同一点，那就是新古典主义经济学的旧有范式已经失效，但在何种范式可以取而代之这一点上却未能达成共识。	Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken, but there was no agreement on what can replace it.
2015年他确保了与六国 — — 中国、法国、德国、俄罗斯、英国和美国 — — 以及欧盟达成协议，暂停伊朗核计划以换取经济援助。	And, in 2015, he secured a deal with six countries – China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – along with the European Union to halt Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for economic relief.
的确，列举行为模式，将听似专业的医学标签贴在表现出这些行为的人身上，接着再用他们的这些行为来证明这个人患有所说的这种疾病—这在科学上是毫无意义的。	Indeed, making lists of behaviors, applying medical-sounding labels to people who manifest them, and then using the presence of those behaviors to prove that a person has the illness in question is scientifically meaningless.
德国的“没有对等表现和控制，就不给钱”立场已经破产，当天早晨所进行的激烈讨价还价正好与默克尔的如意算盘背道而驰。	The German dogma of “no payments without counter-performance and control” was thus off the table, and the bargain struck in the early hours of the morning was exactly the opposite of what she had wanted.
八年来，位于肯尼亚农村的奥维诺乌胡鲁（Owino Uhuru）的我的社区一直暴露在国家许可的冶炼厂所导致的铅污染的毒害之下。	For eight years, my community in rural Kenya, Owino Uhuru, has been exposed to toxic lead poisoning caused by the operations of a state-licensed smelter. The World Health Organization’s measure of lead poisoning is five micrograms per deciliter.
例如，法律与正义党就已经赢得了大规模选举支持，而这一切在某种程度上多亏了出于政治目的对过去悲剧的利用。	The PiS, for one, has accrued substantial electoral support, thanks in part to its exploitation of past tragedies for political ends.
根据历史学家道格拉斯·欧文（Douglas Irwin）的记录，一个显著的意外是瑞典经济学家卡塞尔（Gustav Cassel ） ， 在1928年的一系列剑桥大学讲座中，卡塞尔警告了“世界性的长期萧条 ” 。	As the historian Douglas Irwin has documented, a major exception was the Swedish economist Gustav Cassel. In a series of lectures at Columbia University in 1928, Cassel warned of “a prolonged and worldwide depression.”
中国担心金正恩政权的崩溃会引发一场严重难民危机，数以百万计的朝鲜人会穿越中朝边界寻求食物和栖身之所以及躲避战乱，而中国将为此承受沉重的经济和社会代价。	China worries that the collapse of the Kim regime would fuel a major refugee crisis, with millions of Koreans pouring across its border in search of food, shelter, and security – and imposing heavy economic and social costs on China in the process.
自那以后，哈马斯内部的反对之声就逐渐升级。 该运动的流亡领导人甚至不惜与公开反对团结协定的哈马斯加沙政权决裂。	Ever since, disagreements within Hamas have been escalating, pitting the movement’s Diaspora leadership against the Hamas-led Gaza administration, which has openly rejected the unity deal.
此外，工资增长的停滞意味着通货膨胀不会达到美联储的目标率，而这又意味着美联储将不得不以慢于预期的速度实现利率正常化。	Moreover, sluggish wage growth implies that inflation is not reaching the US Federal Reserve’s target rate, which means that the Fed will have to normalize interest rates more slowly than expected.
正如孱弱的中国不能指望威尔逊的保护，强大的中国也不能指望特朗普走开 — — 至少在不给他点颜色的情况下是如此。	Just as a weak China was not able to count on Wilson’s protection, a strong China will not be able to count on Trump to get out of its way – at least not without throwing a few elbows.
与此同时，税收竞赛将继续破坏市场竞争，也让政府无法获得资金投资于公共品。 而从长期看，公共品是确保企业盈利能力的必要条件。	In the meantime, tax competition will continue to erode market competition, while denuding governments of the money needed to invest in the public goods needed to ensure firms’ profitability over the long term.
按克林顿的说法，美国希望欧洲可以紧随其后，这样一来亚洲将不再仅仅是一个市场，而同时也是共同战略行动的焦点。	The US, according to Clinton, hopes that Europe will follow suit, so that Asia is seen not only as a market, but also as a focus of common strategic action.
但如果亨利·华莱士（Henry Wallace）当了总统（如果罗斯福没有在1944年用杜鲁门替换他做了副总统，这完全是可能的 ） ， 可能会改变美国的反应风格。	But a Henry Wallace presidency (which would have occurred if FDR had not switched him for Harry Truman as vice president in 1944) might have changed the style of the US response.
指出政府联合政党之间的分歧，以及单个政府政党之间的分歧，都被延迟了，一直到正式加入欧盟以后才重新提及。	Addressing conflicts among government coalition parties, as well as within individual government parties, was postponed until after official EU entry.
事实上，这样的理解曾经激发了国际社会最伟大的团结壮举，如签署《1951年难民公约 》 ， 规定民众有权跨国寻求庇护。	Indeed, this understanding has inspired some of the international community’s greatest feats of solidarity, such as the 1951 Refugee Convention, which defines a person’s right to find safe havens across borders.
埃塞俄比亚政府发动了一场预算支出高潮，修建公路，铁路，电站，以及一项令大部分穷人居住的农村地区生产力显著提升的农业技术推广体系。	The Ethiopian government went on a spending spree, building roads, railways, power plants, and an agricultural extension system that significantly enhanced productivity in rural areas, where most of the poor reside.
1980年，法国小丑Coluche其实是主动退出总统竞选，原因是一家报纸统计其民意支持率为16 % ， 这让他担心会过于影响选举结果。	In 1980, the French clown Coluche actually dropped out of the presidential race when one newspaper put his popular support at 16%, causing him to fear that he might influence the result too much.
这些阿拉伯人 — — 通常是经济精英 — — 所阅读、敬仰和消费的文化尽管宣称致力于“普世价值 ” ， 但却是严格的欧洲中心论，由基督教智识传统主导。	These Arabs – often the economic elite – read, admire, and consume products of a culture that, despite its proclaimed commitment to “universal values,” continues to be stingily Eurocentric and dominated by Christian intellectual tradition.
不过尤其考虑到多米尼加近年来的经济发展在很大程度上反映了海地移民的贡献，因此它必需摒弃政治阶层不少人持有的排外态度。	But it must supersede the exclusivist attitudes held by many members of its political class, particularly given that much of its economic growth in recent years reflects the contribution of Haitian immigration.
联合国秘书长2013年的报告《所有人的生命尊严 》 （ A Life of Dignity for All）要求成立全球日程确保不会将任何人遗漏。	The UN secretary-general’s 2013 report “A Life of Dignity for All” calls for a universal agenda to ensure that no one is left behind. But millions of people – and particularly women – already are being left behind.
本书是皮克提和包括牛津大学的托尼·阿特金森（Tony Atkinson）在内的多人多年苦心研究的结果。	The book’s release follows more than a decade of painstaking research by Piketty and others, including Oxford University’s Tony Atkinson.
一个关键的原因是日本的劳动适龄人口参与就业比例不断增加：目前失业率处于不到3%的历史低点，几乎80% 的劳动者都能找到工作，而欧洲和美国大约只有70 % 。	A key reason is that it has put a growing proportion of its working-age population to work: unemployment is today at a record low of less than 3%, and almost 80% of those who could work have a job, compared to about 70% for Europe and the US.
ULYP与贝鲁特美利坚大学（American University of Beirut，长期以来被誉为地区成功企业家的摇篮）等著名机构有着紧密合作。	The ULYP has close ties to prestigious institutions such as the American University of Beirut, which has long been regarded as an incubator for successful entrepreneurs in the region.
在这笔融资中有1000亿元来自中国国家开发银行，500亿元来自国家集成电路产业投资基金 — — 于2014年创建的国家级政府指导基金。	Of that financing, CN¥100 billion came from the CDB and CN¥50 billion came from the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund. a national-level GGF created in 2014.
他知道特朗普在韩国的支持率远比他在美国已经很低的支持率更加糟糕，因此他试图利用这样的现实来推进其核常态化目标。	He knows that Trump’s approval ratings in South Korea are far lower than his already-abysmal ratings in the US, so he is exploiting that fact to facilitate his nuclear-normalization objective.
在接受国货币并未相对美元升值的情况下，2005－2008年人民币对美元20%的升值无疑对中国增加对外投资起了不可忽视的作用。	The 20% revaluation of the renminbi against the US dollar in 2005-2008 undoubtedly facilitated this in the case of recipient countries whose currencies did not also appreciate against the dollar.
而且，相对于财政政策而言，衰退保险不会对政府造成开销。 这是因为，如果它能够刺激信心，那么，所要保险的风险就不会发生。	Moreover, recession insurance might, in contrast to fiscal policy, impose no costs on the government, for if it stimulates confidence, then the risk being insured against is prevented.
这是因为第一个要求偿还的债权人往往能收回全款，而其他人只能部分收回 — — 这也因此产生了一向激励因素，令所有债权人都一窝蜂地要求还债，即便借债人还没失去偿还能力。	This is because the first creditors to be paid would receive the full amount owed to them, leaving less for later creditors – and thus creating an incentive for all creditors to rush for the exits even before debt servicing had become impossible.
发自华盛顿特区 — — 反全球化政治运动的崛起以及贸易保护主义的威胁令一些人不禁猜想是否应该构建一个更强大的世界经济多边核心来减少破坏性分裂的风险。	WASHINGTON, DC – The rise of anti-globalization political movements and the threat of trade protectionism have led some people to wonder whether a stronger multilateral core for the world economy would reduce the risk of damaging fragmentation.
奥巴马将继承的世界，是一个一切形式的权力-包括军事、经济、外交和文化方面-比以往任何时候都更广泛地分散的世界。	Obama will inherit a world in which power in all of its forms – military, economic, diplomatic, and cultural – is more widely distributed than ever before.
同一天，黎巴嫩总理哈里里在利雅得的电视直播现场宣布辞职，指责伊朗对其他国家的干预导致了“灾难和混乱 ” 。	On the same day, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation in a live television broadcast from Riyadh, accusing Iran of causing “devastation and chaos” through its meddling in other countries.
危险的是，正如之前经常所发生得那样，真正的价值变化的可能性将被那些把它看作又一个赚钱的机会的人霸占。	The danger is that the potential for a real change in values will be co-opted, as has happened so often before, by those who see it as just another opportunity to make money.
科锐（Cree）和飞利浦开发出比传统白炽灯寿命长23倍、色彩更好、更易控制、操作成本压缩85%的LED照明技术。	Cree and Philips have developed LED lighting technologies that offer 23 times longer life, measurably better color, easier control, and 85% lower operating costs than traditional incandescent bulbs.
到2030年，生活在城市中的居民将贡献91%的全球消费增长，而中国正在同时强调城镇化和消费拉动的增长模式。	By 2030, people living in cities will drive 91% of global growth in consumption, and China is emphasizing both urbanization and a consumer-led growth model.
但就在这项决策做出后不久，官僚机构就试图将公开听证会变成可有可无的形式，而召集听证会的本意是在解决类似问题时将发言权赋予公众和民间机构。	Yet right after that, the bureaucracy tried to turn the public hearings – called to give people and civil institutions a voice in solving such problems – into an empty formality.
但是，身为这一制度的主要受益者之一，特朗普承诺推行有利于普通美国百姓的承诺是不可信的；共和党的税收改革通常大大有利于富人。	As a major beneficiary of this system, however, Trump’s pledges to pursue reforms that benefit ordinary Americans are not credible; as usual with Republicans, tax changes will largely benefit the rich.
坦白讲，有一点我一直感到颇为诧异，那就是美国经济学家不愿意讨论引起当前危机并阻碍美国复苏的结构性问题。	Frankly, I am always struck by US economists’ reluctance to discuss the structural problems that caused the current crisis, and that hinder America’s recovery.
一间企业依然在 24 小时开工生产；其他企业则暂时停工，只等限期过后再次恢复生产；只有极少的一部分企业真正拆除了设备。	One site was still operating 24 hours a day; in others production had been temporarily halted until the deadline passed. In only a very few cases had any machinery actually been removed.
当然，首先是高明的“演技 ” ， 汉娜·阿伦特（Hannah Arendt）在她对亚里士多德的《尼各马可伦理学 》 （ Nicomachean Ethics）的评论中说，这一品质是艺术家和政客所共有的。	First, of course, there is virtuosity, the quality that, as Hannah Arendt described in her commentary on Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, artists and politicians shared.
朱塞佩·托马西·兰佩杜萨（Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa）的名著《豹 》 （ Il Gattopardo）中写道，改变一切最后只能让一切不变。	As in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s great novel Il Gattopardo (The Leopard), changing everything could be just the way to keep it all the same.
坎布里奇—8月25日星期五，美国政府对委内瑞拉实施了金融制裁，限制总统马杜罗政府及其石油公司PDVSA在美国资本市场发行新债的权利。	CAMBRIDGE – On Friday August 25, the US government imposed financial sanctions on Venezuela, restricting the ability of President Nicolás Maduro’s government and its oil company, PDVSA, to issue new debt in American capital markets.
令人惊讶的是，这样的联盟十分稀少，许多小国 — — 特别是发展中小国 — — 致力于培养与“老大哥”国家的关系或者加入地区联邦结构。	Surprisingly, very few such alliances exist, with many small countries – especially developing ones – cultivating close ties with “big brother” countries or immersing themselves in regional federal structures.
否则，促增长改革将失去政治合法性，让破坏性民族主义、本体论和保护主义力量继续风生水起，从而破坏中长期增长。	Otherwise, pro-growth reforms will lose political legitimacy, enabling destructive nationalist, nativist, and protectionist forces to continue to gain traction and thus to undermine medium- and longer-term growth.
与此同时，它也将避免存在多个欧洲所造成的复杂性 — — 多个欧洲选项也许对纯粹从功能着眼的老牌欧洲官僚很有吸引力，但很快就变得无可救药地复杂。	At the same time, it would avoid the complications of having multiple Europes – an option that may be attractive to veteran Eurocrats from a purely functional perspective, but soon becomes hopelessly complicated.
因此当年初俄国试图把出口乌克兰的天然气价格提升到原来四倍的时候，俄国辩解说它所要求的不过是市场价格。	So when Russia sought earlier this year to quadruple the price of its gas exports to Ukraine, it argued that it was simply demanding market rates.
David Landes喜欢讲述Nathan Meyer Rothschild的故事。 这个19世纪前半叶全世界最富有的人在50多岁时死于脓肿感染。	David Landes likes to tell the story of Nathan Meyer Rothschild, the richest man in the world in the first half of the nineteenth century, dead in his fifties of an infected abscess.
寻求共识、避免煽动、追求增量从而实现可持续发展 — — 上述目标听起来似乎都不是那么伟大，但却深刻而且合乎道德。	Seeking consensus, avoiding demagoguery, pursuing incremental and, therefore, sustainable solutions – none of that sounds terribly epic, but it is profoundly moral.
我们现在知道，神经元回路的活动受由少数神经元分泌并散布于神经系统广大区域的神经调质（如多巴胺、血清素和乙酰胆碱）的强烈影响。	And we now know that the activity of neuronal circuits is strongly influenced by neuromodulators (such as dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine), which are secreted by a small group of neurons and diffuse through large regions of the nervous system.
但美国有利的就业趋势伴随着金融部门风险的大幅增加，这是因为为了实现目前的经济复苏而实施了过于宽松的货币政策。	But America’s favorable employment trend is accompanied by a substantial increase in financial-sector risks, owing to the excessively easy monetary policy that was used to achieve the current economic recovery.
据IMF的数据，中国年GDP增长已从2010年的10%放缓至8 % ； 与此同时，印度增长率从11.2%降至5.7 % 。	According to the IMF, China’s annual GDP growth has slowed to 8%, from 10% in 2010; over the same period, India’s growth rate slowed from 11.2% to 5.7%.
美元价值的下跌不仅会让中国的外汇储备贬值，还会使美国不愿继续进口便宜的中国商品，而这些便宜的中国货对于中国来说意味着失业和不稳定。	China would not only reduce the value of its reserves as the dollar’s value fell, but it would also jeopardize America’s continued willingness to import cheap Chinese goods, which would mean job losses and instability in China.
如果中国不得不动用武力支持其在（比如）南海或台湾海峡的激进策略，那么解放军决不能由腐化不忠的将军领导。	Should China have to back its aggressive tactics in, say, the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait with force, its military must not be led by venal and perfidious generals.
美国的新保守主义者们已经把他们国家相当大的力量和道德权威浪费在和伊拉克那场无谓的战争上，心甘情愿地削弱了西方唯一的全球大国的力量。	America’s neo-conservatives have wasted a large part of their country’s power and moral authority in an unnecessary war in Iraq, willfully weakening the only global Western power.
集团各成员国同时也同意把即将与国际货币基金组织借款计划挂钩的危机借款最低比例从80%降低到70%来增加协议的灵活性。	The group also agreed to enhance the CMIM’s flexibility by reducing the minimum portion of crisis lending to be tied to the International Monetary Fund’s lending program from 80% to 70%.
他们一般投票率更高、更愿意参与公民活动、更倾向于远离犯罪、更好地教育子女、并且因为生活方式更健康而减少患病的几率。	They also tend to vote at higher rates, engage in more civic activities, commit fewer crimes, educate their children better, and get sick less frequently by adopting healthier lifestyles.
正因如此，现在就开始做出变化从而实现未来退休金稳定对美国 — — 以及世界各地的其他许多国家 — — 来说至关重要。	That is why it is important for the US – and for many countries around the world – to act now to make the changes needed to stabilize future pension finances.
拜登没有具体指出世界上的某个地区，但是提到中东、印度次大陆以及俄罗斯最有可能是给新总统制造麻烦的源头。	Biden did not point to a specific region of the world, but mentioned the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent, and Russia as the likeliest sources of trouble for the new president.
中国处于全球价值增加链的总装端，将使中国让位给经济发展阶段更低的国家，比如孟加拉国，因为那里的收入水平更低（但与美国之间的贸易余额不会有太大改变 ） 。	The final-assembly links of global-value added chains will leave China for countries at earlier stages of economic development, such as Bangladesh, where incomes are lower (though without producing much change in the balance with the US).
纽黑文 - - 国际货币基金组织首席经济学家布朗夏和该组织的其他几位经济学家最近在一片论文中建议政府应该提供“衰退保险 ” 。	NEW HAVEN – The Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard, and several IMF economists have proposed in a recent paper that governments should offer what they call “recession insurance.”
理查德·菲舍尔（Richard Fisher，达拉斯联邦储备银行行长 ） 、 汤姆·霍尼格（Tom Hoenig，FDIC）和耶利米·诺顿（Jeremiah Norton，FDIC）等拥有崇高威信的人士公开谈论“太大而不能倒”带来的持续不断的问题。	Credible figures, such as Richard Fisher (Dallas Fed president), Tom Hoenig (FDIC), and Jeremiah Norton (FDIC) speak publically about the continuing problems posed by “too big to fail.”
只要涉险过关的多数党派掌权后奉行温和主义的政策，其合法性就可能受到变幻无常、而非四分五裂的选民们的欣然认可。	As long as winners with razor-thin majorities, once in office, steer a middle course, they are more likely to remain acceptable to an electorate that is more volatile than divided.
事实上，人们越来越清楚地认识到中国开放经济的目的不过是保持国内过度强大的执政统治，而并不是要尊重和改善普通中国人的生活。	Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that China opened its economy only to maintain the country’s over-mighty rulers in power, not to respect and enhance the lives of ordinary Chinese.
在1980年代任挪威首相期间，我应当时的联合国秘书长哈维尔·佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔（Javier Pérez de Cuéllar）的邀请担任世界环境与发展委员会主席。	In the 1980s, while serving as Norway’s prime minister, I chaired the World Commission on Environment and Development, at the invitation of then-United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.
尽管在起草南美国家联盟提案时可能比其他计划更加谨慎，但其未能将贸易一体化纳入考虑意味着除去单纯的政治意愿外，再没有其他因素可以联系各成员国。	While the Unasur proposal may have been formulated in a more rigorous way than other initiatives, its failure to contemplate trade integration means that there is nothing to tie member states together beyond political will.
德国人一直要求制度变革 — — 对外围银行和政府预算实行中央化的欧元区控制，以此换取对外围国的融资支持。	The Germans have been insisting on institutional change – more centralized eurozone control over periphery banks and government budgets in exchange for expanded access to financing for the periphery.
这一要求面临两大局限：欧洲投行本身很谨慎，不会轻易拿自己的金融评级冒险，而其贷款也很容易取代私人融资。	Such calls face two limitations: the EIB itself is careful not to jeopardize its financial rating by taking on too much risk, and its loans easily substitute for private financing.
大范围的结构性经济调整及改革深化需要稳健的货币政策和稳定及社会可承受的通胀预期，但在表现良好的实体经济对信贷有持续增长的实际需要的情况下，过度收紧货币政策会影响经济调整过程的顺利展开。	While broader structural economic change requires tighter monetary policy and lower inflation, excessively tight monetary policy, given continued high credit demand, could disrupt the adjustment process.
如果这一目标实现，到2030年所有构架的新生儿死亡率都将低于每1,000新生儿12例 — — 这一比例是撒哈拉以南非洲一些地区当前水平的四分之一。	If this target is met, by 2030 no country will have a neonatal mortality rate above 12 deaths per 1,000 births – a quarter of the current rate in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.
为了对付“政府失灵 ” ， 公司面临着各种相关利益方的压力 — — 包括来自不胜任和腐败的政府本身的压力 — — 去纠正广泛的社会和环境问题。	In response to “government failures,” companies face pressure from a variety of stakeholders – including incompetent and corrupt governments themselves – to address broad social and environmental problems.
不幸的是，到目前为止，危机国家 — — 以法国为首 — — 还没有任何迹象表明做好了咬紧牙关的准备。	Unfortunately, thus far, there is no sign that the crisis countries, above all France, are ready to bite the bullet.
实际上，象棋程序现在非常接近于通过前英国数学家阿兰-图灵对人工智能的极限测试：人类能否与识别自己不是人类的机器交谈呢？	Only a machine can consistently tell what another computer would do in a given position. Perhaps if Turing were alive today, he would define artificial intelligence as the inability of a computer to tell whether another machine is human!
大体上讲，学法语的人数只有学英语的一半，学德语的是它的四分之一，学西班牙语的是它的八分之一。 而且尽管有了欧盟委员会的努力，这些数字还是在不断下降，因为人们总是会选择那些他们认为被使用和学习得最多的语言。	Roughly half as many learn French, a quarter German and an eighth Spanish, and these numbers are falling, despite the Commission’s efforts, because people tend to choose the foreign language that they believe is spoken and studied the most by others.
但法国全民公决的结果加重了欧洲其它国家政府的担忧。 它们担心提出的任何旨在重新恢复欧盟宪法的新议案都会再次在国内及欧洲范围内的反对势力面前遭遇惨败。	But France’s referendum result fueled other European governments’ fears that any new proposal they might put forward to re-launch the EU constitution would fail in the face of domestic and Europe-wide opposition.
华盛顿特区 - - 当全球与二战后最为严重的金融危机斗争的时候，人们把注意力集中到了受到直接影响的发达国家和新兴市场经济体。	WASHINGTON, DC – As the world struggles with the most serious financial turmoil of the post-war era, attention has focused on the advanced and emerging-market economies most immediately affected.
他用整整四年时间集中和巩固权力，他所属的人民党控制了29个邦中的22个，并在取得下议院多数后很有可能再次取得上议院多数（上议院由印度各邦议会选出 ） 。	He has spent the last four years centralizing and consolidating power, and his BJP has gained control of 22 of 29 states, complementing its lower-house majority with a likely majority in the upper house (which is elected by state assemblies).
事实上，这正是问题的焦点所在：从凭空想象、互相认为对方没有生存权、相互抵触的历史叙述以及在宗教上均宣称拥有主权的斗争中脱离出来。	Here, indeed, is the central point: the need to move away from mythological, mutually exclusive rights of existence, conflicting historical narratives, and religious claims of ownership.
提高退休年龄来巩固法定退休金制度常常被抨击为不公平，因为体力劳动者，如护士和力工，无法工作到70岁。	Raising the retirement age to shore up a statutory pension scheme is often denounced as unfair, because people with physically demanding jobs, such as nurses and manual laborers, cannot be expected to work until they are 70.
问题在于汇率变化是如今唯一的协调机制，而某些市场的估值和基本面的分歧极其巨大，价格极有可能陷入波动。	The problem is that exchange-rate shifts now represent the only mechanism for reconciliation, and the divide between certain market valuations and their fundamentals has become so large that prices are vulnerable to bouts of volatility.
作为非洲高人口生产率的结果，联合国人口司预计2050年非洲的人口数量将在目前9亿的基础上翻一番，达到18亿。	As a result of high fertility rates in Africa, the UN Population Division predicts a doubling of Africa's population from around 900 million today to around 1.8 billion in 2050.
考虑到如今的经济和财政条件，公共部门投资极有可能在国家预算中被挤出，该计划代表了增长导向型公共部门投资的重大承诺。	Given today’s difficult economic and fiscal conditions, where public-sector investment is likely to be crowded out in national budgets, this program represents a major commitment to growth-oriented public sector investment.
此外，利比亚的过度暴力也会让其他国家的民众认为代价太过高昂，而埃及和突尼斯相对和平的过渡可能无法重现。	In addition, the excessive violence in Libya might send the message to other peoples in the region that the cost of change is too high to pay, and that the relatively peaceful transitions seen in Egypt and Tunisia might not be replicable.
此外，欧盟多年金融框架（Multi-Annual Financial Framework）计划日程意味着由谁为谁支付的问题每七年才会更改一次。	Moreover, the planning horizon under the EU’s Multi-Annual Financial Framework implies that the issue of who pays for whom has to be addressed only once every seven years.
普京的主张 — — 法西斯主义者控制了基辅 — — 是彻头彻尾的谎言，而俄罗斯在克里米亚和东乌克兰的卑劣行动则是铁一样的事实。	Putin’s claim that fascists have taken control in Kyiv is fundamentally bogus, while Russia’s despicable actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine are all too real.
前堪萨斯城联邦储备银行主席、现任联邦存款保险公司高管之一的汤姆·霍尼格（Tom Hoenig）支持将大银行的商业银行和证券交易活动拆分。	Tom Hoenig, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and now a top official at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, advocates separating big banks’ commercial and securities-trading activities.
而与之相反，弗朗索瓦·密特朗只告诉法国人他们并不坏，因为密特朗本人先是参加了维希政权Marshal Pétain的通敌卖国阴谋，而后又加入了抵抗力量。	Francois Mitterrand, by contrast, managed to assure the French only that they were not so bad, because he, Mitterrand, had served in the collaborationist Vichy regime of Marshal Pétain before joining the resistance.
按照信贷增长和资产价格通胀的标准衡量准则，这个国家现在应该已经经历了一场金融危机。 因此，中国当局采取了阴阳政策，刺激经济增长以防止经济快速放缓，但抑制这些刺激措施以遏制金融风险。	By historical standards, an economy as rich as China today should be growing at 3-5% a year, rather than the 6% or more that the Chinese authorities are trying to achieve through fiscal and credit stimulus.
由此产生了包括400多家机构和4,000多个活跃发明者在内的全球网络，它所申请的专利比许多研发密集型公司还要多。	The resulting global network of more than 400 institutions and over 4,000 active inventors has produced more patent applications than many R&D-intensive companies do.
我们花了许多年 — — 合理的估算是从1992年里约地球峰会以来经过了整整一代人的努力 — — 才达成了巴黎气候协定，并在2015年12月获得了联合国所有193个成员国的一致通过。	It had taken many years – by one plausible accounting a full generation since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit – to reach the Paris climate agreement, unanimously adopted by all 193 UN member states in December 2015.
今年和明年，美国、法国和德国均将举行全国大选，选战将形成一个对一切形式的国际协定日渐怀有敌意的环境。	National elections will be held this year and next in the US, France, and Germany, and the campaigns will play out in an environment that is increasingly hostile to international agreements in any form.
货币和黄金的联系在1971年美国总统尼克松决定中止各国央行美元和黄金的相互兑换时便已不可逆转地切断了。	The link between currencies and gold was irrevocably broken in 1971, when US President Richard Nixon decided to suspend the convertibility of dollars into gold for central banks.
此前，军方常常让外交部无所适从；而中共外事办公室（负责朝鲜事务）往往不能协调其与外交部（负责韩国事务）的行动。	Previously, the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark; and the party’s foreign-affairs office, which handled North Korea, often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry, which handled South Korea.
世界银行的新数据表明，极端贫困人口比例在过去30年中下降了一大半，从1981年占总人口的42%下降到2010年的17 % 。	New data from the World Bank show that the proportion of extremely poor people has more than halved over the last 30 years, from 42% of the global population in 1981 to 17% in 2010.
相反，哈佛大学经济学家肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）指出，成功的去货币化需要可执行的全面计划来增加金融包容和银行的使用。	On the contrary, as Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff argues, successful demonetization requires a comprehensive and implementable plan to increase financial inclusion and use of banks.
如此谨慎和克制的直接原因是美国人集体认识到，2001年袭击后大量无辜的美国穆斯林因为美国人的无知和激愤而受到了不公待遇。	This caution and restraint stemmed directly from a collective awareness of the many innocent Muslim-Americans who suffered from Americans’ ignorance and wrath following the 2001 attacks.
事实上，法国、意大利、比荷卢经济联盟（包括比利时、荷兰和卢森堡）以及德国早在1952年就已经同意在欧洲防务共同体框架下组建欧洲军队。	Indeed, France, Italy, the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), and Germany had agreed to form a European army as early as 1952 under the Framework of the European Defense Community.
国际货币基金组织仓促地让西方人购买银行，却忘记了一个细节，那就是确保韩国可以通过税收重新获取至少些许收益。	In its rush to have westerners buy the banks, the IMF forgot one detail: to ensure that South Korea could recapture at least a fraction of those gains through taxation.
因为尽管俄国精英从未认为自己在冷战中落败，但西方的做法从本质上说，就是在以对待战败国的方式对待俄罗斯；而北约东扩便是这种态度的典型表现，这一做法为目前的紧张状态埋下了很深的伏笔。	For, while Russia’s elite never considered itself defeated in the Cold War, the West essentially treated Russia as a defeated country – an attitude symbolized by NATO’s eastward expansion, which laid a deep foundation for ongoing tension.
我的组织对于经济进步的方针就是建立和强化非正式的和官方的网络，通过这些网络，妇女能够及时提高她们在重要部门的参与度和辨识度（visibility ） 。	My organization’s approach to economic advancement is to establish and strengthen informal and official networks, through which women can, in time, increase their participation and visibility in key sectors.
20世纪30年代，法西斯主义者和纳粹也批斗犹太人，还有马克思主义者和共济会成员，他们将犹太人称为“世界主义者”或“国际主义者 ” — —即忠诚度非常可疑的人。	In the 1930s, Fascists and Nazis also denounced Jews, as well as Marxists and Freemasons, as “cosmopolitans” or “internationalists” – people whose loyalty was suspect.
但不久前聚在一起袭击反对派的民众很多都曾受到过爱德华·谢瓦尔德纳泽(Eduard Shevardnadze)政府的监禁，谢瓦尔德纳泽政府在被认定为民主运动的2003年“玫瑰革命”中被萨卡什维利推翻。	But the people rounded up in the latest raid against the opposition were originally imprisoned by Eduard Shevarnadze’s government, which Saakashvili helped depose in Georgia’s supposedly democratic “Rose revolution” in 2003.
被免职的前中共中央政治局委员薄熙来热衷派对的儿子薄瓜瓜在哈罗公学 — — 温斯顿·丘吉尔的母校 — — 上过学，后来去了牛津大学和哈佛大学。	Disgraced ex-Politburo member Bo Xilai’s hard-partying son, Bo Guagua, attended Harrow, Winston Churchill’s alma mater, then Oxford and Harvard.
如果当非洲在开始走向成功，但它的发展前景却被一场与之无关的危机所荼毒的话，那么整个事件将堪称是一个莫大的讽刺。	It would be a cruel irony if, just as Africa begins to succeed, its prospects are cut short by a crisis beyond its control.
参议院有人质疑用对穆斯林和俄罗斯的强硬派麦克·蓬佩奥（Mike Pompeo）接任瑞克斯·蒂勒森（Rex Tillerson）的国务卿职位的合理性。	Questions are being raised in the Senate about the suitability of Mike Pompeo, a hardliner on Muslims and Russia, to succeed Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.
美国国防部长阿什顿·卡特（Ashton Carter）回答说 ， “ 这并没有什么错误：美国将进行国际法允许的飞行、航海和其他行动，我们在全世界都是这么做的 。 ”	US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter replied that, “[T]here should be no mistake about this: the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows us, as we do all around the world.”
事实上，卡拉奇有时也被称为“瞬间出现的城市 ” ， 自1947年巴基斯坦独立后人口因数次移民潮增长五十倍之多。	Indeed, Karachi is sometimes called an “instant city,” having grown 50-fold as a result of several waves of migration since Pakistan gained independence in 1947.
长期以来，人们认为女性预期寿命更长与“生物倾向 ” （ biological predisposition）有关，比如女性铁水平较低从而能够提供保护，或者不存在男性Y染色体的“额外”基因等。	Women’s longer life expectancy has long been linked to differences in “biological pre-disposition,” with theories ranging from the protection afforded by women’s lower iron levels to the absence of “extra” genes on men’s Y chromosome.
美国平均寿命预期增长速度不及欧洲，部分原因在于1999年以来许多中年美国白人寿命缩短，而这是与生活方式有关的疾病、类鸦片药物使用过量和自杀造成的。	Average US life expectancy has increased more slowly than in Europe partly because many white middle-aged Americans have, since 1999, been living shorter lives, owing to lifestyle-related diseases, opioid overdoses, and suicides.
因此，左翼联盟极有可能根据希腊选举法获得关键奖励 — — 赢得选票最多的政党可以在300个席位的议会中额外获得50个席位。	As a result, Syriza stands to earn a crucial premium under Greek electoral law, according to which the party that gains the most votes is allocated an extra 50 of the parliament’s 300 seats.
所以世界现在应该好好思考一下那句古拉丁格言“沉默意味着容忍 ” ， 并且想一下默认普京建立一个不守法律的能源超级大国是否是明智之举。	So the world must now ponder that old Latin maxim qui tacet consentere videtur – silence means consent – and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin’s construction of a lawless energy superpower.
美国前国家安全顾问兹比格涅夫·布热津斯基不久前提出坚决反对军事行动，并提出战略要继续制裁并扩大威慑。	Former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski recently argued strongly against military action, proposing, instead, a strategy that would continue sanctions and extend deterrence.
此外，欧盟的东欧新成员国既没有经济实力也没有长期成员国那样的政治上的稳定，它们现在的情况开始急剧恶化。	Moreover, the new EU member states in Eastern Europe, which have neither the economic strength nor the political stability of long-term members, are now beginning to take a nosedive.
因此，国际社会坚持现有核义务比以往任何时候都更加重要，其中首推坚持1968年核不扩散条约（NPT ） 。	For this reason, it is more important than ever that the international community upholds existing treaty obligations, starting with the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
布鲁塞尔和欧洲其他首都的领袖知道欧盟必须对民众日益增长的不满情绪作出反应，并且 — — 这样做可以获得政治资本的一天终于到来了。	In Brussels and a number of Europe’s capitals, leaders know that the EU must respond to mounting discontent, and that – at long last – there is political capital to be gained in doing so.
法国经济学家托马斯·皮凯蒂（Thomas Piketty）观察到，这一过程可能在我们的过去起到了一定作用，并且必定会在我们的未来起到更大的作用。	As the French economist Thomas Piketty has observed, this process may have played some role in our past, and will surely play an even bigger role in our future.
这是欧洲研究机构和非政府组织联合体土地矩阵合伙组织（Land Matrix Partnership）去年题为《南半球跨国农用土地交易 》 （ Transnational Land Deals for Agriculture in the Global South）的报告中提出的问题。	That question is raised in Transnational Land Deals for Agriculture in the Global South, a report issued last year by the Land Matrix Partnership, a consortium of European research institutes and nongovernmental organizations.
一年后，欧盟领导人再次汇聚塔林，并通过了一项截止“2019年5月欧洲议会选举前指导欧盟行动”的“领导人计划 ” 。	One year later, EU leaders reconvened in Tallinn and adopted a “Leaders’ Agenda” to “guide EU action up until the European Parliament elections in May 2019.”
它始于发达世界，9月，美国投资银行雷曼兄弟（Lehman Brothers）倒闭，并首次蔓延到新兴经济体。	It began in the developed world, with the fall of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers that September, and initially spread to emerging economies.
第二次世界大战后，凯恩斯所担忧的问题逐渐淡化为背景，因为复兴的西方繁荣让许多人相信这些问题已经永久得到了解决。	After World War II, the problems that concerned Keynes faded into the background, as renewed prosperity in the West led many to believe that they had been permanently solved.
简单地讲 ， “ 英国退出欧盟论”已经暴露出欧洲的经济和政治裂痕 — — 回到旧日的美好时光已经不可能。	Simply put, talk of “Brexit” has exposed Europe’s economic and political fault lines – and there is no going back.
现在出现了希望的迹象。 超过160个国家已经签署世界卫生组织全球烟草控制条约，而加勒比各国领导人最近宣布他们将联合一致对付烟草问题。	There are hopeful signs: more than 160 countries have signed the World Health Organization’s global tobacco control treaty, and the Caribbean heads of state have recently declared they want to tackle tobacco together.
选民们将以一种痛苦的方式学到威权主义会加剧而非减轻腐败，因为它撤销了对那些拉动权力杠杆者的体制制衡。	Voters will learn the hard way that authoritarianism exacerbates rather than mitigates corruption, because it abolishes checks and balances on those pulling the levers of power.
而事实上，如果没有哈梅内伊的首肯，核协议也不可能达成，这也解释了为何在竞选期间没有获选人质疑核协议。	And, indeed, the nuclear agreement could not have been reached without Khamenei’s approval, which helps explain why no candidate questioned the deal during the campaign.
虽然大多数阿拉伯政权似乎都受到了威胁，但目前为止只有两位独裁者 — — 突尼斯的本·阿里和埃及的穆巴拉克最终被推翻，事实上他们的独裁统治也都属于相对较“软性”的类型。	Yet, while most Arab regimes now appear threatened, only two authoritarian rulers – Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak in Egypt – have been actually deposed so far. Theirs were relatively “soft” autocracies.
另一组国家 — — 葡萄牙、爱尔兰、意大利、希腊和西班牙 — — 的结果就要复杂得多：希腊和葡萄牙债券的收益率飙升，而爱尔兰的收益率直到最近才开始上升。	Another group – Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain (PIIGS) – has had more mixed outcomes: yields have soared on Greek and Portuguese bonds, while Ireland’s were falling until recently.
例如，位于中部的甘肃省与中国其他大多数地方一样正在应付结构性和社会问题，这些问题有的很棘手，有的难以克服。	For example, like much of the country, Gansu Province, at China’s geographical center, is grappling with structural and social problems that range from the daunting to the apparently insuperable.
在2005年，荷兰和法国的全民公决出人意料地使《欧盟宪法》草案遭遇决定性的破坏时，人们觉得这就是欧盟的滑铁卢。	European integration, is felt to have, somehow met its Waterloo in 2005, when Dutch and French referendums unexpectedly torpedoed the draft EU constitution.
接着，在去年8月，中国人民银行将人民币中间价调低1.9 % ， 这也许是为了回应IMF鼓励中国让人民币平价水平更接近市场汇率的报告。	Then, last August, the PBOC lowered the renminbi central parity rate by 1.9%, perhaps in response to an International Monetary Fund report encouraging China to align the parity rate more closely with the market rate.
最后还有弹劾这种补救办法，这些日子这种办法在华盛顿引发了越来越公开的讨论，伴随这样的讨论还流行一本书，那就是艾伦·J·里奇曼的弹劾案例。	Finally, there remains the remedy of impeachment, which is being discussed more and more openly in Washington these days, accompanied (in a sign of the times) by a book, The Case for Impeachment, by Allan J. Lichtman.
毕竟乌克兰不是身处枪口下的唯一国家，普京最近还威胁要保护哈萨克斯坦的俄国公民，更不要说还恐吓波罗的海国家。	After all, Ukraine is not the only country under the gun, as Putin’s recent threats to “protect” Russian citizens in Kazakhstan, not to mention his intimidation of the Baltic states, attest.
如��新任执委们以各自国内的政治日程为重，最坏情况是杜朗·巴罗佐会领导执委会在功效卓著的领域有所退步。	The bottom line is that with the new Commission members focused on their domestic political agendas, Durao Barroso's team will do less effectively what the Commission used to do well.
目前还有待观察的是，从2007年6月开始控制加沙地带的哈马斯会不会支持这一由其死对头、阿巴斯领导的位于约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦权力机构提出的动议。	What remains to be seen is whether Hamas, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since June 2007, will eventually support this initiative by its bitter rival, Abbas’s West Bank-based Palestinian Authority.
以美国为首的委婉公关闪电战已经开始，美国助理贸易代表卡特勒将最新优惠贸易协定（泛太平洋伙伴关系协定）称之为“高标准”的协议。	The US-led public-relations blitzkrieg of euphemism has already begun, with US Assistant Trade Representative Wendy Cutler describing the latest PTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as a “high standard” agreement.
Karni Sena组织砸毁了位于斋普尔斋格尔堡（Jaigarh Fort）的电影拍摄布景，并追到科拉普尔（Kohlapur）的新（ 更不“真实 ” ） 拍摄地干扰拍摄，指责班萨利加入印度教女王和穆斯林入侵者的感情线。	The Karni Sena trashed the film set at Jaigarh Fort in Jaipur, and disrupted further shooting in a new (less “authentic”) location at Kohlapur, accusing Bhansali of filming a love scene between the Hindu queen and the Muslim invader.
习近平主席承诺要建设伟大国家 — — 他所提出的“中国梦”即是明证 — — 对于这个目标，实现地区霸权与实现国内进步同样重要。	President Xi Jinping’s promise of national greatness – embodied in the catchphrase “China dream” – is tied as much to achieving regional hegemony as to internal progress.
不过解决像华雷斯这样一座城市根深蒂固的社会和经济问题比派8，000名手持突击步枪的士兵占据这座小城的街道要困难得多。	Addressing the deep-seated social and economic problems of a city like Juárez, however, is a lot harder than flooding its streets with 8,000 soldiers carrying assault rifles.
普京地缘政治的当务之急本可以通过保留碳氢工业管道建设的国家所有权和允许私有企业提炼、加工、出售俄罗斯的石油和天然气来实现。	Putin’s geopolitical preoccupations could be accommodated by sensibly preserving state ownership of pipeline infrastructure in the hydrocarbons sector, while allowing private companies to extract, process, and sell Russia’s oil and gas.
对沙特来说，唯一可接受的方案必须以巴沙尔及其政府的辞职为出发点，而日内瓦II构想的过渡政府将包括所有各方的代表。	For the Saudis, the only acceptable solution starts with the resignation of Assad and his government, while Geneva II envisages a transitional government in which all of the parties are represented.
当回顾2008年来我所撰写的文章时，我发现自己有时也急于推进个人最喜欢的方法，而不顾可能给其他方法造成的损失。	When I look back at everything I have written since 2008, I find that I, too, have sometimes been too ready to push my favorite recipes at the expense of others.
如果民主西方世界的根本生存果真会被一场伊斯兰革命所摧毁，只有寻求美国非正式帝国的全力保护才会有道理。	If it were really true that the fundamental existence of our democratic Western world were about to be destroyed by an Islamist revolution, it would only make sense to seek protection in the full force of the US informal empire.
但是科恩（以及欧盟）面对的问题是：这种程度的支持似乎并不会转化成投票箱里的赞成票。 在过去三次针对欧盟��约的投票中，爱尔兰人两次都投的死反对票。	But the problem for Cowen (and for the EU) is that this level of support does not seem to translate to the ballot box: the Irish rejected EU treaties on two of the last three occasions when they were asked to vote.
普京当局紧紧抓住亚美尼亚所欠俄罗斯的9300万美元债务，要求要么用现金支付，要么占有亚美尼亚的主要产业股权。	Seizing on a $93 million debt that Armenia owed to Russia, the Putin administration demanded payment in either cash or equity in Armenia’s major industries.
导游所背诵的数据令人惊讶：世界第三大建筑、耗费高达220,000平方英尺地毯、100万立方米大理石、3，500吨水晶。	The statistics rehearsed by our guide were staggering: the third biggest edifice in the world, 220,000 square feet of carpet, one million cubic meters of marble, 3,500 tons of crystal.
就在最近，普京的两个副手分别接受两家西方媒体的采访，谁知两人却对俄罗斯的未来发展提出了针锋相对的观点。	Just recently, two of Putin’s deputies gave interviews to two Western media outlets offering what sounded like starkly opposite visions for Russia’s development.
毕竟，权衡直面不相关的外部暴力势力的利弊是一回事；猛烈打击带政治目的的、令人不快的野蛮影像的炮制者是另一回事。	After all, it is one thing to deliberate on the pros and cons of confronting external forces of irrational violence; it is something else to lash out against the producers of brutal, politically charged, and upsetting imagery.
可以肯定，在尼日利亚和巴基斯坦等国仍有太多儿童无法接受教育，但真正的问题在于小学教育结束后会出现什么状况。	To be sure, too many children remain out of school in countries like Nigeria and Pakistan, but the real problem lies in what happens after the primary years are over.
最早的袭击之一发生在1903年马可尼展示其无线电传输时。 当时，他要实现康沃尔（Cornwall）和300英里外的伦敦之间的通讯。	One of the first attacks struck Guglielmo Marconi’s demonstration of radio transmission in 1903, when he communicated from Cornwall to London, 300 miles away.
在1922年的论文《沉闷的科学 》 （ The Dismal Science）中，蒙肯（H.L. Mencken）解释了为何经济学家会忽视全球化可能给美国这样的发达经济体所造成的负面社会影响。	In his 1922 essay “The Dismal Science,” H.L. Mencken suggested why economists would ignore the negative social effects that globalization can have on an advanced economy such as the US.
一方面经济增长收益流向了极少数高收入美国家庭的份额越来越大，另一方面下层那90%家庭的平均收入却自1980年以来一直原地踏步。 按照经济顾问委员会最近发布的一份报告。	With an expanding share of the gains from economic growth flowing to a tiny fraction of high-income US households, average family income for the bottom 90% has been flat since 1980.
事实上正如任何旅游者（比如今年夏天的笔者）触目可见的那样，即使是在北海道的钏路和根室这样位处日俄有争议岛屿附近的小城市都在以轻快的速度进行重建和现代化。	In fact, even the small cities of Kushiro and Nemuro in Hokkaido, located near the disputed islands between Russia and Japan, are being rebuilt and modernized at a brisk pace, as is apparent to any tourist (as I was this summer).
通过扩展我们对具商业价值的特点的认识，如抗虫性、木质、生长率和对气候变化的适应力，基因组学有助于改善树木育种和森林管理的可持续性。	By broadening our understanding of commercially valuable traits, such as insect resistance, wood quality, growth rates, and adaptation to climate change, genomics has helped to improve the sustainability of tree breeding and forest management.
阻止的办法只有一个：那就是公开探讨经济政策。 只有这样才能发现谬误、为制定有创造性的解决方案创造条件。	There is only one way to prevent this: open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide scope for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today.
但至关重要的则是一党制国家 — — 尤其是马克思主义国家 — — 在对现实进行“理想化”的过程中如何抉择：这关乎整个系统是如何跟自身对话的。	But how one-party states, particularly Marxist states, choose to “ideate” reality matters a great deal: it is how the system speaks to itself.
这一狭隘、短期的关注点与上市公司所采取的方法是不同的，上市公司强调资产负债表的强劲程度和经济的潜力，以及年度利润表。	This narrow, short-term focus differs from the approach taken for publicly traded companies, for which the strength of the balance sheet and the economy’s potential are emphasized, alongside annual income statements.
通过专注特定能力素养、而不是花在课堂上的时间，西部州长大学实现了以低廉的价格提供灵活的教育服务；一套全日制课程，包括教材和导师，每年仅需收取约6，000美元的费用。	By focusing on the attainment of specific competencies, rather than on the amount of time spent in a classroom, WGU has been able to offer flexibility at bargain rates; a full-time program, including textbooks and a mentor, costs about $6,000 a year.
“三十年前，伊朗人民好比是羊群，而哈梅内伊就是他们的牧羊人 ， ” 一位著名伊朗民主运动分子对我说。	“Thirty years ago people were sheep and Khomeini was their shepherd,” a prominent Iranian democratic activist told me.
但在印度、印尼和菲律宾等“年轻”国家，工作年龄人口实际将有所增加，未来三十年可以让平均年增长提高1—1.5个百分点。	But in “young” countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, the working-age population will actually increase, adding from 1-1.5 percentage points to average annual growth over the same period.
然而，当SARS在2003年爆发时，蒋医生意识到卫生部在4月份发布的关于北京有19粒确诊病例的报告是虚假的-他所知的确诊病例就几乎是该数字的十倍。	However, as the SARS epidemic flared up in 2003, Dr. Jiang realized in April that Health Ministry reports of only 19 confirmed cases of the disease in Beijing were bogus - he knew of almost ten times that amount.
资本是中国GDP增长率的最大贡献因素，这毋庸置疑。 但中国经济的TFP表现也令人印象深刻 — — 而这一现象却是无法用粗放型增长模式解释的。	While capital has been the largest contributor to China’s GDP, the economy’s TFP performance has been impressive – something that cannot be explained by an extensive growth pattern.
在这个问题上，中国可以更好地贴近主流国际思维，开始统一世界眼中的中国和中国眼中的中国这两种认知间的差距。	It is here, more than anywhere else, that China can align itself within mainstream international thinking and start to close the gap between how it is viewed by the world and how it views itself.
欧盟与古巴政权开始进行对话，制裁也有条件地中止了，并且向持不同政见者清楚地表明好几个民主国家的大使馆并不欢迎他们。	The EU opened a dialogue with the Cuban regime, sanctions were conditionally suspended, and it was even made clear to dissidents that they were not welcome at the embassies of several democratic countries.
事实上，土耳其一直与库尔德地区政府关系密切 — — 双边贸易规模近年来不断扩大，而库尔德地区政府的输油管道则向土耳其控制地区延伸 — — 因为埃尔多安政府将其视作对土耳其库尔德工人党势力的平衡。	In fact, Turkey has strong relations with the KRG – bilateral trade has lately been expanding, and KRG oil pipelines extend into Turkish territory – because Erdoğan’s government views it as a counterweight to Turkey’s PKK.
欧盟银行之所以会发挥不同作用是有结构和历史原因的，我们也不应指望欧洲资本市场能完全遵循其北美同行的运作模式。	There are structural and historical reasons for the different role played by EU banks, and one should not expect European capital markets precisely to follow the pattern of their North American counterparts.
欧洲国家以及美国的历届政府对取代类似法塔赫那样的阿拉伯世俗民族主义者的“伊斯兰替代品”怀有隔代遗传的恐惧，因此维护现状。	Successive European and American governments share an atavistic fear of the “Islamic alternative” to Arab secular nationalists like Fatah, and so have defended the status quo.
当今美国，很有一些左翼与特朗普一样急切地想要让墨西哥为过去三十年来制造业就业的减少完全“背锅 ” 。	In the US today, some on the left are just as keen as Trump to blame Mexico for the entire decline in manufacturing employment over the past three decades.
一位总统或一名首相可以很容易地忽略掉一千个网站；而更荒谬的是，网络传播渠道和声音的多样性却反而削弱了媒体监督政治领导人履行其义务的能力。	It is easy for a president or prime minister to ignore a thousand Web sites; the multiplicity of outlets and voices online, paradoxically, has weakened the media’s power to force accountability from leaders.
但是始于1970年、围绕米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）推行的货币主义政策而进行的富有发达国家重组却结束了这一切。	But the realignment of the rich, developed countries around the monetarist policies promoted by economists like Milton Friedman, which began around 1970, broke with all that.
我们必须发扬对那些遭受不幸的人的同情精神，对儿童、老人、穷人、残疾人、难民以及孤独的人进行特别的关怀；	We must develop a spirit of compassion with those who suffer, with special care for the children, the aged, the poor, the disabled, the refugees, and the lonely;
正因如此，委员会努力将所有的团体聚到一起，包括老师、部落首领、宗教领袖、妇女、警察、士兵、法官和商人，共同寻找非暴力解决冲突的有效方法。	The Committees therefore seek to bring together all sections of the community – including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, police, soldiers, judges, and businesspeople – to develop ways of resolving conflicts non-violently.
但是，有些（可能是很多）小企业的境况就大不相同了，它们饱受资金缺乏困扰，无法成长，不少还被迫收缩规模。	Some, perhaps many, small businesses are, however, in a very different position; strapped for funds, they can’t grow, and many are being forced to contract.
19世纪，专制的俄国、德国和奥地利帝国的共同利益阻止了自由波兰的最终诞生：如此邪恶的联盟在21世纪将没有容身之地。	In the nineteenth century, the joint interests of the authoritarian Russian, German, and Austrian Empires prevented the establishment of a free Poland: such unholy alliances have no place in the twenty-first century.
公投前和公投以来没有任何加泰罗尼亚精英提供一种明确的解释，告诉外界为什么必须建立独立的加泰罗尼亚国家或者对这个即将建立的国家进行描述。	At no point before or since the independence referendum have any of them offered an articulate explanation of why a separate Catalan state is necessary or what it would look like.
这就是我和其他八位科学家同事提出成立新的基于人体免疫学的临床研究计划 — — 人类疫苗工程（Human Vaccines Project）的原因。	That is why I, along with eight fellow scientists, have proposed the establishment of a new human-immunology-based clinical-research initiative, the Human Vaccines Project.
伊斯兰堡－现在，巴基斯坦的佩尔韦兹·穆沙拉夫在面对对其总统职位最严重的挑战 — — 新的经过民主选举出来的政府可能对其进行的弹劾 — — 的时候，他事实上是孤零零的。	ISLAMABAD – Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan stands virtually alone today while facing the most serious challenge to his presidency: possible impeachment by the new democratically-elected government.
这意味着中央政府的角色应该是提供更先进的安全资产 — — 如固定或轮转的空中支持、情报以及物流和通讯支持。	This means that the central government’s role should be to provide more advanced security assets such as fixed or rotary air support, intelligence, and logistical and communications support.
目前，太阳能电池板非常昂贵 — — 其能源输出成本相当于化石燃料的10倍之多 — — 只有那些富有而热心（而且往往手握大把补贴）的西方人才能用得起。	Right now, solar panels are so expensive – about 10 times more than fossil fuels in terms of cost per unit of energy output – that only well-heeled, well-meaning (and, usually, well-subsidized) Westerners can afford to install them.
过去，众议院金融服务委员会（Financial Services Committee）听证室里有一个国民债务钟，当这个钟向上走动时，共和党就会批评政府乱花钱。	There used to be a national debt clock in the hearing room of the House Financial Services Committee, and Republicans would rant about government profligacy as it ticked upward.
因为，即便是面对像中国这样的“战略竞争者 ” ， 我们还是应该想到我们共有一个地球，我们分享着空气、水、工业品甚至是食品。	For, even with “strategic competitors” like China, we now live in a global commons in which we share air, water, manufactured goods, and even food.
人们一般在已经心存怨愤的情况下才会去响应武力号召 — — 尤其当他们感觉所属团体在资源和就业方面面临被歧视的状况。	People will generally respond only if they already have grievances – in particular, if they feel that their group faces discrimination in access to resources and jobs.
那是因为在大多数非洲国家连男子国家足球队的日子都不好过，在那些地方男子足球训练营和联赛要么根本没有，要么就办得一塌糊涂，更别提女子足球了。	That is because in most African countries, even men’s national teams are struggling. Male youth soccer camps and leagues are either nonexistent or mediocre.
新框架将迫使所有相关利益方 — — 包括世界银行集团、地区开发银行、双边机构、欧洲投资银行（EIB）和其他机构 — — 重新审视它们在更大的体系中的角色。	A new framework will force all stakeholders – including the WBG, regional development banks, bilateral agencies, the European Investment Bank (EIB), and other institutions – to reexamine their role in the larger system.
首先，未锚定的通胀预期和结构性困难可能意味着提振需求的努力几乎全部转化为价格的更快增长，而对提高就业毫无用处。	For starters, unanchored inflation expectations and structural difficulties might mean that efforts to boost demand show up almost entirely in faster price growth and only minimally in higher employment.
而且由于世界最大（美俄）和最不可测 （朝鲜）的核国家目前由脆弱而又妄自尊大的人领导，世界末日的景象看起来太过真实。	And with particularly fragile egos currently leading the world’s biggest (US and Russia) and most unpredictable (North Korea) nuclear-armed states, the doomsday scenario is simply too plausible for comfort.
在欧洲，这场争论的特点是异议和分歧，英国最近投票脱离欧盟就是明证 — — 这一结果很大程度上是拜英国人过度担心移民所赐。	In Europe, the debate is characterized by dissent and division, exemplified by the United Kingdom’s recent vote to leave the European Union – an outcome that was shaped largely by overblown fears about immigration.
但是如果新闻机构主动努力避开互联网过滤，而不是被动地依赖防火墙里面的那些人自己寻找突破被封锁的网站的方法，那么新闻的受众可能将会比现在多的多。	But news organizations could reach many more people if they worked to circumvent Internet filtering instead of passively relying on those inside the firewall to figure out how to reach beyond blocked sites on their own.
在法国 ， “ 世俗化 ” （ laïcité）一词 — — 在英语中，它被错误地译为“secularism ” — —是宗教的同义词，法兰西共和国的宗教。	In France, laïcité, wrongly translated in English as “secularism,” is the equivalent of a religion – the religion of the Republic.
在欧洲，欧盟的财政规则是问题所在，而欧盟委员会 — — 原则上它是欧盟的看门狗 — — 应该在问题没有得到重视时大声吠叫。	In Europe’s case, the European Union’s fiscal rules are at issue, and the Commission – in principle the EU’s watchdog – should bark loudly when they are flouted.
与此同时，建设和维护高速公路和运输体系的成本有了极大的增长，而能源效率的提高也降低了每英里汽油税收入。	Meanwhile, the costs of building and maintaining highway and transit systems have increased significantly, and rising fuel efficiency has reduced gasoline tax revenues per mile driven.
世界银行和世界野生动植物基金组织最近承诺将联合起来，争取在2010年以前把全球的采伐率降低10个百分点，并且和其它公共机构以及私人团体一同朝着森林保护的伟大目标前进。	The World Bank and WWF recently pledged to unite in an effort to assist in reducing the rate of global deforestation by 10% by 2010, and to work with other public and private sector institutions to pursue ambitious targets on forest conservation.
但特朗普和内塔尼亚胡相互助长对方的鹰派立场，仍然拒绝接受世界其他国家眼中两国方案这一任何真正协议的基本前提。	But Trump and Netanyahu, feeding each other’s hawkishness, both remain unwilling to accept what the rest of the world views as the basic premise of any good deal: a two-state solution.
在英国，亲普京的英国独立党（UK Independence Party）正在挖首相卡梅伦的墙角，因此英国政府拒绝承担合理的难民负担。	In the United Kingdom, the pro-Putin UK Independence Party is nipping at Prime Minister David Cameron’s heels, so the government refuses to commit to taking Britain’s fair share of refugees.
两人都以同样无法效仿的方式显示了其乖张的个性，这种个性在知识分子圈子里极富争议，人们对之可以说是非爱即恨：阿隆提倡英美式的自由主义，在其成为一种时尚之前；萨特在共产主义浪潮在法国过去之后继续保持着共产主义同情者的身份。	Each in his inimitable way displayed the contrariness both loved and loathed in intellectuals: Aron fancied Anglo-American liberalism before it became fashionable, while Sartre remained a Communist sympathiser after the fashion had passed.
但是，请记住修西底德（Thucydides）的忠告，它对避免错误解读分析家的现实理论十分重要，并且还将继续向政治领导人和公众指出这一点。	But, remembering Thucydides’ advice, it will be important not to mistake analysts’ theories for reality, and to continue pointing this out to political leaders and publics.
但我们或许也同样可以说使用人工甜味剂是“对我们味觉的扭曲 ” ， 而味觉则是为品尝可口的食物而存在的。	But we might just as well say that using artificial sweeteners is a “perversion of our sense of taste,” which exists so that we can detect nourishing food.
而由于发达国家和新兴市场都面临着严重的下行风险，修正走势可能只是2013年全球经济和金融市场糟糕表现的开端。	And, given the seriousness of the downside risks to growth in advanced and emerging economies alike, the correction could be a bellwether of worse to come for the global economy and financial markets in 2013.
相反，我们必须投资和推广新技术，理顺激励，认识到卫生体系无法存在于真空中，以此将公共卫生体系推广到常规边界之外。	Instead, we must push public health systems beyond their usual boundaries by investing in and promoting new technologies, sharpening incentives, and recognizing that health systems do not exist in a vacuum.
国会预算办公室和美联储预计跌下财政悬崖将在2013年导致衰退，美联储伯南克最近宣称，美联储无法冲销经济所受到的消极效应。	The Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve predict that going over the fiscal cliff would cause a recession in 2013, with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke recently saying that the Fed would be unable to offset the adverse effect on the economy.
如果总体消费每四年增长一倍，道路上行驶的汽车和飞机飞行的里程数也会相应翻番，我们将很快超过地球的承载限度。	If, as overall consumption doubles every four years, we also double the number of cars on the road or miles that jets fly, we will quickly exceed the planet’s limits.
主要地区势力 — — 如埃及、土耳其和卡塔尔等 — — 现在都支持信心高涨的哈马斯，如今，后者的最高目标是巩固其改善的国际合法性、逼宫约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦权力机构。	Major regional powers like Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar now support an emboldened Hamas, whose paramount objectives are now to consolidate its increased international legitimacy and sideline the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA).
那些自觉幸福的人往往寿命更长，更少出现自杀，滥用药物或者酗酒等行为，更容易升职，朋友更多，婚姻也更长久。	People who claim to be happy tend to live longer, commit suicide and abuse drugs and alcohol less often, get promoted more frequently by their employers, and enjoy more good friends and lasting marriages.
更可能出现的状况是中国将继续出现贸易顺差（虽然规模更小）以及一个投资收入逆差，与美国的贸易逆差和投资收入顺差形成正反对应。	A more likely scenario is that China will continue to have a trade surplus (though much smaller) and an investment-income deficit, mirrored by America’s trade deficit and investment-income surplus.
民族、宗教和文化特征（这里缺少更准确的形容词）正在发生转变，虽然转变的动力与其说是移民还不如说是不断发展的全球化资本主义。	National, religious, and cultural identities (for lack of a better word) are being transformed, though less by immigration than by the development of globalized capitalism.
不幸的是，总统奥巴马剩下的任期不足以启动让参议院重新对CTBT投票所需要进行的费时的教育和宣传运动。	Unfortunately, President Barack Obama does not have enough time left in office to launch the time-consuming education and outreach campaign needed before bringing the CTBT to the Senate for another vote.
雅克·希拉克（Jacques Chirac）12年执政，以及法国领导层变动的传统，都表明胜利属于左翼党派。	The 12 years of Jacques Chirac‘s presidency, together with France’s tradition of alternation in power, suggests a victory for the left.
基督教民主联盟(Christian Democrats)和社会民主党如此迅速地(Social Democratic party)摒弃了各自在选举中的承诺，一致通过了增税计划，这着实令人感到惊诧不已。	It is amazing to watch how quickly Christian Democrats and Social Democrats have forgotten their electoral promises and agreed on a program of higher taxation.
事实上，近一半的正式人口增长（formal increase）根本不是增长，只不过是承认了早已在城市中生活和工作的农民工的地位。	Indeed, almost half of the formal increase is not an increase at all, but merely recognition of rural workers who have been living and working in cities for some time.
造成这一现象的部分原因是，苏联对此的最初反应是诡秘的。 当时的苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在1986年5月14日，也就是事故发生几周后才对此发表电视讲话。	In part, this is because the initial Soviet response was secretive: Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader at the time, addressed the issue on television only weeks later, on May 14, 1986.
相反，俄罗斯是一个衰落的国家，面临着严重的人口和公共卫生问题，能源而非制成品贡献了其出口的三分之二。	In contrast, Russia is a declining country with serious demographic and public health problems, with energy rather than finished goods accounting for two-thirds of its exports.
两份协议都是在怀疑因来自中国西藏的工程的泄洪所导致的暴发性洪水反复摧毁印度印度阿鲁纳恰尔邦和喜马偕尔邦后签订的。	Both accords arose after flash floods linked to suspected discharges from Chinese projects in Tibet repeatedly ravaged India’s Arunachal and Himachal states.
这一伤害将变得更加严重，如果温室气体排放无法在2055—2070年间下降到净零水平，这一伤害可能将无法控制。	This damage will become worse, with risks becoming unmanageable if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced to net zero levels between 2055 and 2070.
随着全球变暖导致平均气温和海平面双双升高，位处内陆的核反应堆将越来越成为水资源短缺的元凶（或成为缺水的影响 ） 。	As global warming brings about a rise in average temperatures and ocean levels, inland reactors will increasingly contribute to, and be affected by, water shortages.
工厂工作仍然不令人愉快，但蓝领岗位已能够让人过上中产阶级的生活，拥有中产阶级的消费能力和生活方式机会。	While factory jobs never became pleasant, blue-collar occupations now enabled a middle-class standard of living, with all its consumption possibilities and lifestyle opportunities.
但还有另一种更具说服力的观点：虽然经济停滞可以助推选民进入民粹主义阵营，但经济形势低迷不是政治混乱的必要和充分条件。	Yet there is an alternative – and more persuasive – view: while economic stagnation helps push upset voters into the populist camp, bad economics is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for bad politics.
人们似乎十分欣赏他用例子和行动，而不是用教皇通谕教导众人的偏好 — — 协调在第二次梵蒂冈公会问题上立场对立的两位教皇就是明证。	People seem to appreciate his preference for teaching by example and dramatic gesture – exemplified by his canonization of the rival stars of Vatican II – rather than by encyclical.
尽管如此，以巴格达迪为首的伊斯兰国认为，其新哈里发意志将 — — 事实上，是想必将 — — 不断壮大。	Nonetheless, with al-Baghdadi at its helm, the Islamic State is convinced that its new caliphate will – indeed, is supposed to – flourish.
建立一个完全的欧亚联盟 — — 逐渐减少与西方的贸易、金融、经济、支付、通信和政治联系 — — 也许只是空想。	Creating a full EAU – one that is gradually less tied to the West by trade, financial, economic, payments, communications, and political links – may be a pipe dream.
货币政策 — — 特别是最近几年被央行采用的开足马力印钞的“量化宽松”计划 — — 也已经没有了空间，物价通胀正在抬头，央行资产负债表规模也达到了创纪录的水平。	Monetary policy – in particular, the vast money-printing “quantitative easing” programs pursued by central banks in recent years – has run out of space, too, with price inflation ticking up and central-bank balance sheets a record size.
但减速的规模令人奇怪，同样令人奇怪的是减速从2008年衰退之前几年就开始了 — — 而且不仅局限于私人保险系统，也出现在两大政府卫生项目 — — 医疗保险（Medicare）和医疗补助（Medicaid）上。	But the size of the slowdown is surprising, as is the fact that it started several years before the 2008 recession – and not only in the private insurance system, but also in Medicare and Medicaid, the two major government health programs.
如果现有公司想在这一同时被自上而下和自下而上两股力量左右的新环境下竞争，就必须做出改变，通过学习如何颠覆自己先发制人地颠覆新来者。	If existing companies hope to compete in this new environment, shaped by both top-down and bottom-up forces, they will to have to adapt, preempting disruptive new players by figuring out how to disrupt themselves.
与此同时，双方都冒着扰乱转移支付（包括老人补助）和公共服务供给的风险，甚至进一步威胁到美国的全球信用。	In the meantime, both sides risk disrupting transfer payments (including to the elderly) and the provision of public services, as well as eroding further America’s global credit standing.
比如，如果密苏里州堪萨��城30个街区的溪边（Brookside ） “ 光小区”的1000户人家有25%与预先订阅，那么谷歌将会立刻为所有1000户家庭提供价格极低、速度极快的互联网服务。	If, say, 25% of the 1,000 households in the 30-block Brookside “fiberhood” in Kansas City, Missouri, pre-subscribe, Google will provide all 1,000 with the opportunity to get very cheap, very fast Internet service very soon.
李是世界历史和文学的狂热爱好者，但显然未能吸取1949年后很多中国人通过巨大的个人悲剧所得到的教训。	Li, an avid reader of world history and literature, has apparently not taken to heart the lesson that so many Chinese have learned, through great personal tragedies, since 1949.
当那些大型发展中国家 — — 比如巴西、俄罗斯，印度和中国 — — 得以避免这类不平等协议之时，其他小国只能自认倒霉。	While large developing countries – such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China – can avoid such impositions from developed economies, most others cannot.
中国还以此前无法想象的规模融入了全球供应链 — — 为其他地区的公司生产东西 — — 中国管理者也学会了如何制造更好的产品。	China also became integrated into global supply chains – producing things for companies elsewhere – on a previously unimaginable scale, and Chinese managers learned how to make better products.
要想击败病毒，我们必须摒弃将伊斯兰教徒视为反西方科学暴力狂热份子的讽刺画，���真审视病毒根除工作迄今为止尚未取得成功的特定政治环境。	If the virus is to be defeated, we will have to move beyond caricatures of Islamists as violent zealots opposed to Western science and look closely at the specific political contexts in which the eradication effort has so far been unsuccessful.
除了找到第一份工作，大学毕业生似乎比那些只有高中学历的人更容易适应经济的发展和劳动力市场需求的变化。	Apart from finding a first job, college graduates seem to adapt more easily than those with only a high school degree as the economy evolves and labor-market needs change.
在平稳且渐进式发展的时代，宏观经济模型是政策制定者们的可靠工具，但绿色增长却不属于渐进式变革的范畴。	The macroeconomic models on which policymakers depend are solid tools in times of smooth and incremental evolution, but green growth is not about gradual change.
事实上，在占有绝对空中优势的情况下 — — 如20世纪20年代的美索不达米亚和1945年的日本 — — 大规模杀戮可以在几乎无成本的条件下实现。	Indeed, with supremacy in the air, as in Mesopotamia in the 1920s or Japan in 1945, mass killing can be carried out at virtually no cost at all.
大多数发展中地区的国家，像拉丁美洲、北非、中东以及大部分亚洲地区将会有能力把它们的潜在工人大军吸收到生产性就业上来，并且从随之而来的经济激增中大为获益。	Countries in most developing regions, such as Latin America, North Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia, may be able to absorb their armies of potential workers into productive employment and benefit appreciably from the ensuing economic boost.
戈尔和汉森希望能推迟火电厂的建设，但却忽视了未来几年即将在中国和���度建成的数百座火电厂将帮助近十亿人脱离贫困。	Gore and Hansen want a moratorium on coal-fired power plants, but neglect the fact that the hundreds of new power plants that will be opened in China and India in the coming years could lift a billion people out of poverty.
尽管如此 — — 更不用说中国GDP高速增长带来的刺激作用 — — 2001—2010年日本经济年均扩张幅度仍然只有0.75 % 。	Despite these efforts – not to mention the boost provided by rapid GDP growth in China, Japan’s economy expanded by just 0.75% annually, on average, for the entire decade.
俄罗斯是一个能源超级大国。 至少在某种来说，俄罗斯可以开启其“保险箱”去缓解国家最近伪造司法选举结果而使其公民所遭受到的羞辱感。	As an energy superpower, Russia can open its coffers to appease, at least in part, the humiliation that it has inflicted on its citizens by falsifying the country’s recent legislative election results.
但在短期，如独立政治分析家德米特里·奥瑞什金（Dmitri Oreshkin）在盖达尔论坛上所指出的那样，有可能只有来自国外的“黑天鹅”事件能够改变俄罗斯。	In the short term, however, as the independent political analyst Dmitri Oreshkin put it at the Gaidar Forum, it is likely that only a “black swan” event abroad could bring about change in Russia.
而如果实力就是确保实现某些人制定的目标的能力，也必须牢记有时实力会在与他人合作（而非施加于他人之上）时变得更加强大。	If power is the ability to obtain the outcomes one wants, it is important to remember that sometimes our power is greater when we act with others rather than merely over others.
虽然也有人谈论，其中甚至不乏某些共和党人，任命一个专门委员会或一位特别检察官来调查有关俄罗斯和特朗普竞选的指控，但与1973年相比，这一调查却遭遇了非同寻常的阻力	Although there has been talk, even from some Republicans, about appointing a select committee or a special prosecutor to look into the allegations about the Russians and the Trump campaign, the resistance has been extraordinary compared to 1973.
从加入跨太平洋合作伙伴（TPP）谈判，到引入特别管辖区（我自己的办公室将监督它们的实施 ） ， 我的政府致力于竭尽全力催化经济复苏。	From joining the negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to introducing specially deregulated zones (my own office will oversee their implementation), my government is committed to catalyzing economic recovery by all means available.
如果将这一方针应用于包括在国际社会的下一个发展日程中的所有目标，可以肯定2030年的世界将远比现在更加美好。	This approach, if applied to all of the goals included in the international community’s next development agenda, would ensure that the world of 2030 is a much better place.
俄国则通过残酷镇压车臣、2008年格鲁吉亚战争抑或是目前出兵乌克兰不遗余力地恢复其昔日大陆帝国的威严。	For its part, Russia has ruthlessly strived to recover its lost continental empire, be it through the brutal repression of Chechnya, the 2008 war in Georgia, or the current assault on Ukraine.
因此，新协议要求希腊政府立即削减退休金、提高税收（从增值税开始 ） 、 实现劳动力市场自由化、遵守严格的支出约束。	That is why the new deal requires that the government immediately cut pensions, hike taxes (beginning with the value-added tax), liberalize the labor market, and adhere to severe spending constraints.
马德里 — — 2005年基督徒占绝大多数的南苏丹和以穆斯林为主的北苏丹签署的《全面和平协议 》 （ CPA）结束了当代一次最血腥的内战。	MADRID – The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that was reached in 2005 between mostly Christian southern Sudan and the country’s Muslim North, ended one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern times.
2003年阿克拉全面和平协定（Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement）或许终结了多年的内战，但该国只剩下51 名医生，医疗基础设施也破败不堪。	The 2003 Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement may have ended years of civil war, but it left the country with only 51 doctors and decimated infrastructure.
事实上，每个欧盟成员国的公民越来越意识到，他们的国家政策现在由欧洲级别的决策来决定，而他们对此几乎无法施加任何影响。	The fact is that citizens in every EU member country are increasingly aware that national policies are determined by decision making at the European level, over which they have little influence.
两位左翼明星伊丽莎白·沃伦（Elizabeth Warren）和伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）也为克林顿摇旗呐喊；如果她获胜，他们将要求政策和任命方面的回报。	Two stars of the left, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have also campaigned for Clinton; if she wins, they will call in the debt both in policy terms and on appointees.
但真相是它其实比以往任何时候都更加紧迫，不仅是为了遏制涌向欧洲和其他地区的难民流，也是为了阻止恐怖分子的招募工作。	But the truth is that it is more urgent than ever, not just to check the flows of refugees to Europe and elsewhere, but also to undermine terrorist recruitment efforts.
假设此人找到了一个自由欧持有人愿意出手兑换，则会根据交易的额度，银行欧持有者的急迫程度，以及资本管制的预期持续时间而出现一个银行欧/自由欧汇率。	Assuming such depositors find FE holders willing to purchase their BE, a substantial BE-FE exchange rate emerges, varying with the size of the transaction, BE holders’ relative impatience, and the expected duration of capital controls.
甚至是那些认为没有证据表明资本账户自由化能促进增长的经济学家，也会常觉得有必要强调“进一步分析”最终可能证实自由市场理论所说的好处一定存在。	Even economists who find no evidence that capital-account liberalization boosts growth often feel obliged to stress that “further analysis” might at last reveal the benefits that free-market theory suggests must exist.
我这么说，代表的是那些坚定地相信欧洲对于现时代的核心要求 — — 可持续发展的承诺和开创性的治国之道的人。	I say this as someone who believes firmly in Europe’s commitment and pioneering statecraft when it comes to sustainable development, the core requirement of our time.
但她显然认为自己可以全身而退：即使中间派选民对她有所质疑，他们也不会转投民望极低的极左派劳工党领导人杰里米·科宾（Jeremy Corbyn）的怀抱。	She obviously thinks she can get away with it: even if swing voters have doubts about her, they are not about to bolt to the deeply unpopular hard-left Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
因此目标应当是找到尽管在经济上有利可图，但却因为制度和其他障碍而无法吸引私人投资者的项目，然后，竭尽全力保证这些障碍的消除。	The goal should be to identify projects that, despite being economically profitable, are unattractive to private investors, owing to institutional and other barriers, and then work to remove those obstacles.
全球化的市场、自由贸易、武装伊斯兰和中国的觉醒：这些都被历史学家和战略家们描述为决定我们命运的关键力量。	Globalized markets, unfettered trade, militant Islam, China’s awakening: these are the things historians and strategists usually portray as the key forces shaping our destiny.
大陆自由贸易区是非洲联盟（AU）2063年议程框架下的12个旗舰计划之一，该计划可以使非洲国家内部贸易量增长一倍，并为非洲大陆带来巨大的利益。	The CFTA – one of 12 flagship programs under the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063 framework – could double intra-African trade and bring enormous benefits to the continent.
主力部队在黑暗掩护下无声无息地���着目标迫近，直到被敌人发现再全力冲锋，所有武器一齐开火。 而迫击炮和机枪阵地会留在部队身后，其火力恰好覆盖冲锋部队的前方。	The main assault force advanced toward the target in the darkness until detected, then rushed forward, firing every weapon, while mortar and machine-gun emplacements remained in the rear, firing just ahead of the advancing troops.
还有人会担心国家财富基金是国家拥有的这一事实。 如果投资者的目标并非是将风险调整后的回报最大化，对公司管理将会发生什么影响？	Still others worry about the fact that SWF’s are state-owned: what would happen to corporate governance when investors may have objectives other than maximizing risk-adjusted returns?
首先，尽管发表了声明，但尚不清楚金正恩是否同意“完全、可核查及不可逆转地（CVID）废除”朝鲜的核武计划。	First, despite Kim’s declaration, it remains unclear whether he is agreeing to “complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement” (CVID) of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
压制来自霍多尔科夫斯基的潜在威胁就意味着通过把梅纳特普银行集团从尤克斯集团未来的现金流转中分离出来，以使他丧失成就野心的能力。	Neutralizing the perceived threat from Khodorkovsky meant depriving him of the means to achieve his ambitions by separating his Menatep Group from Yukos’s future cash flows.
虽然在2003年12月得到了“伊拉克管理委员会”的正式批准，但IST的章程是由美国政府按协议制定，并由伊拉克临时权力机构的执行长官L. Paul Bremer批准。	Although officially adopted in December 2003 by the Iraqi Governing Council, the IST’s statute was framed under contract to the US government and approved by L. Paul Bremer, the Coalition Provisional Authority’s Administrator.
乌克兰与格鲁吉亚、乌兹别克、阿塞拜疆及摩尔多瓦都有着地区性联系，并希望在这片辽阔的土地上成为民主和经济自由的核心。	Ukraine has formed a regional association with Georgia, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Moldova, and its ambition is to play the role of a center of democracy and economic freedom in this huge area.
报纸专栏作家哈里·I·菲利普斯（Harry I. Phillips）在1933年的一篇评论中将电力美元视为喜剧笑料 ： “ 一想到在所得税申报表上写明向政府发送300伏电压就觉得很好笑 。 ”	Syndicated columnist Harry I. Phillips in 1933 saw in the electric dollar only fodder for comedy. “But it would be good fun getting an income tax blank and sending the government 300 volts,” he noted.
在一份2012年的工作论文中，莱维定义了正式企业和非正式企业的关键性区别，并研究了它们各自的生产率。	In a 2012 working paper, Levy draws a crucial distinction between formal and informal firms, and their respective productivity.
除非债务国生产成本有所下降，否则增长就不可能复苏，而生产成本下降要么要求生产率的永久性大幅提高，要么要求真实工资下降，要么双管齐下。	Growth will not resume until production costs in the indebted countries decline, which requires either a substantial permanent increase in productivity, a reduction in real wages, or both.
粮食需求的增长 — — 受人口和收入增长驱动 — — 给农村人口带来了机会，但饥饿和贫困依然集中在发展中国家的农村地区。	While the growing demand for food – driven by rising population and incomes – is creating opportunities for rural people, hunger and poverty remain concentrated in rural parts of developing countries.
这一权威的世俗版本对于20世纪70年代西班牙转型为民主国家也至关重要，转型后的西班牙也一直被其他西方君主立宪国家视为基本盘。	A secular version of that authority was also crucial in Spain’s transition to democracy in the 1970s, and remains fundamental to other Western constitutional monarchies.
政府债务已经很高了，但这位掌了权的所谓的强人仍决定提高预算赤字，从而增加更多债务，说这能够让繁荣达到此前无法达到的水平。	Government debt is already high, but the would-be strongman in power decides to pile on even more by increasing the budget deficit, arguing that this will boost prosperity to previously unattainable levels.
尽管不同的估算结果相差很大，但2014年的一份联合国报告表明，光是改善基础设施，就需要高达7万亿美元的总投资。	Although estimates vary widely, one UN report from 2014 suggests that total investment of as much as $7 trillion will be required for infrastructure improvements alone.
经常项目盈余 — — 货币低估最具说服力的现象 — — 从2007年占GDP的10.1 % （ 最高纪录）下降至2013年的2.1 % 。	The current-account surplus – the most telling symptom of an undervalued currency – has narrowed from a record 10.1% of GDP in 2007 to just 2.1% in 2013.
欧盟派驻当地的选举观察团不但数目庞大，而且拥有极佳公信力，因此也应当在选举结束后及时发布一份有说服力的最终报告，表明这场投票是否真实地反映了苏丹南部人民的意愿。	The large and widely recognized EU electoral observation mission on the ground should issue a strong and timely final report that comes down clearly on whether the vote represented the will of the people of South Sudan.
在这一点上，任何和平��程都可以说是如履薄冰，但任何一方在军事上获胜（不管美国是否对叛军提供军火）也是如此。	At this point, any peace process is a long shot, but so is the prospect of either side winning militarily, with or without the arrival of American arms for the rebels.
讨论非洲前程的不仅有政府决策者，而且还有私营部门和民间社会的代表。 我们所有人都承认，他们可以发挥重要的作用。	This discussion of Africa’s prospects will involve not only official policy makers, but also representatives of the private sector and civil society, which, as we all recognize, have a key role to play.
值此领导人筹备又一轮非洲绿色革命论坛讨论之际，安南在粮食安全和繁荣非洲方面的愿景变得比以往任何时候都更加重要。	As leaders prepare for another round of AGRF discussions, Annan’s vision of a food-secure and prosperous Africa is more relevant than ever.
东方曾经惧怕自己无法从与西方的贸易中得到好处，因为后者有发达的基础设施和人力资本，而时至今日，西方开始害怕会从与东方的贸易中蒙受损失，因为后者劳动力资源廉价而丰富。	The East had feared that it could not gain from trade with the West, which had superior infrastructure and human capital; now, the West had come to fear that it would lose from trade with the East, which had abundant, cheap labor.
首先，SDR’s代表着流动性并且只有在存在“全球需求”时才能被分配。 而就现在具有高度流动性和“容易”的国际资本市场的情况来看，要证明这种需求的存在是困难的。	Above all, SDR’s represent liquidity and can be allocated only if and when there is a “global need,” which would currently be difficult to prove given highly liquid and “easy” international capital-market conditions.
对叙利亚人来讲，亲美国的民主伊拉克远比不上萨达姆·侯赛因，他们了解这个老对手，后来还在伊拉克遭到国际制裁时从双边贸易中获利颇丰。	For the Syrians, a democratic Iraq friendly to the US was always far worse than Saddam Hussein, the enemy they knew – and later profitably traded with – during the years of international sanctions against Iraq.
继11月的过渡协议后，我们准备继续与P5+1（联合国安理会五大常任理事国加上德国）和其他国家继续合作，以确保我们的核计划的完全透明性。	Following up on November’s interim agreement, we are ready to continue to work with the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany) and others with a view to ensuring our nuclear program’s full transparency.
显然，问题在于全球金融体系本身的不稳定性 — — 层出不穷的狂热和泡沫以及随之而来的不受监管和监督的金融市场常见的突然停止和急剧逆转。	It became clearer that the problem lay with instability in the global financial system itself – the bouts of euphoria and bubbles, followed by the sudden stops and sharp reversals that are endemic to unsupervised and unregulated financial markets.
之后，欧盟各国政府降低了条件，声称俄罗斯只要从这两个地区以外的格鲁吉亚领土上撤军就够了，可以继续有关PCA、能源安全和其他问题的对话。	Since then, EU governments have moderated their conditions, describing a simple Russian military withdrawal from Georgian territories outside the two regions as sufficient to resume a dialogue on the PCA, energy security, and other issues.
）主要集中在四地的乌克兰压水反应堆不同于低稳定性的切尔诺贝利核电站RBMK设计，但如果保障失效依然可能会泄漏放射性物质。	Concentrated in four locations, Ukraine’s pressurized water reactors differ from the less stable Chernobyl RBMK design, yet still remain capable of releasing radioactive contents should safeguards fail.
因为它们的价值相对于美元或其他等价物是稳定的，所以它们也可以被视为可靠的记账单位和价值储存，而不仅仅是金融投机的载体。	Because their value is stable in terms of dollars or their equivalent, they are attractive as units of account and stores of value. They are not mere vehicles for financial speculation.
监督高科技企业的治理情况所需要的技巧，与管理对外合资企业截然不同，目前后者才是国有企业和主权财富基金更喜欢的形式。	Overseeing the governance of high-tech firms requires a fundamentally different skill set than managing joint ventures with foreign partners, a craft that SOEs and SWFs have recently perfected.
尽管西岸地区的巴勒斯坦经济在萨拉姆·法耶兹总理的领导下出现了明显的好转，但���然无法取代严肃的和平谈判。	Though the Palestinian economy in the West Bank has improved greatly under Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, this is no substitute for serious peace negotiations.
对桑托斯来说，在复杂的国内政治环境中协调和平与正义要求他另辟蹊径，比如缩短刑期、社区惩罚、有条件判决或流��第三国等。	For Santos, reconciling peace and justice in a complicated domestic political context may require alternative formulas, such as reduced sentences, community penalties, conditional verdicts, or asylum in third countries.
李总统计划的其他要素还包括建设生态友好的运输网络，例如高速铁路以及几百公里长的自行车车道，并且从垃圾堆中利用甲烷来制造能源。	Other elements of Lee’s plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks, such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks, and generating energy using waste methane from landfills.
乍看之下，因为有望摆脱纠缠不清的盟国的阴险控制，不结盟貌似印度、印尼、巴西等新兴国家颇具诱惑力的选择。	At first glance, nonalignment looks like an attractive option for still-emerging countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil, and others, because it promises freedom from the insidious grip of entangling alliances.
这对那些年轻的经济学学子来说可算是非常令人沮丧的，因为他们希望这个专业至少能做出一个有恰当挑战性的回应。	This is deeply depressing to young students of economics, who hoped for a suitably challenging response from the profession.
在多数国家中，民主发展还没有达到让政府改变成为政治生活中的常规组成部分、可以在不威胁国家稳定的情况下悄然进行的程度。	In most of these countries, democratic development has not yet reached a point where a change in government is a routine part of political life and can take place without risking the country’s stability.
瓦尔斯利用法国的国家格言辩护道“自由是写作和思想的自由、是男女两性的平等、是友爱和世俗主义，以此为基础才能建立我们的社会团结 。 ”	Referring to France’s national motto, Valls defended “liberty, that is, freedom to write and to think, equality among men and women, and fraternity and secularism, from which is derived our social unity.”
同时，苏丹政府也必须充分认识到，只有坚持以前的承诺，并帮助联合国/非洲联盟准备、部署并维护这一行动才能得到国际社会的继续支持。	At the same time, the Sudanese government must be fully aware that only by adhering to past commitments and by cooperating in helping to prepare, deploy, and maintain the mission will the international community be encouraged to continue its support.
但是，随着全球实力平衡的东移和南下，西方必须不惜一切代价确保其继续拥有影响力 — — 而这意味着对其所面临的战略挑战采取坚实、明确、可信的立场。	But, as the global balance of power shifts toward the East and the South, the West must do what it takes to secure its continued influence – and that means taking a firm, clear, and credible stance on the strategic challenges it faces.
一个经常被人们引用的类比是世界经济是一个“全球公地 ” ： 要么所有国家一起承担维护成本，要么都承受后果。	The analogy frequently invoked is that the world economy is a “global commons”: either all countries do their share to contribute to its upkeep, or they will all suffer the consequences.
欧元区各国彼此之间和对其他地区的贸易十分活跃，这些国家的减速导致了全球贸易量的大幅下滑，从而反过来抑制了全球增长。	Since eurozone countries trade extensively with each other and the rest of the world, their slowdowns have contributed significantly to a decrease in global trade, in turn undermining global growth.
在富有魅力的翁贝尔多·波西的领导下，北方联盟在议会中握有决定性的席位，以此保证贝卢斯科尼政府的稳固。	The Lega Nord, led by the charismatic Umberto Bossi, holds the decisive votes in Parliament to keep the Berlusconi government afloat.
明年，和平谈判将在日内瓦重启，其唯一的成功机会是巴沙尔在被严重削弱后来到谈判桌前，而这不太可能发生。	Renewed peace negotiations in Geneva next year can succeed only if Assad comes to the table substantially weaker, which probably will not happen.
四年前，穆罕默德和全家为了躲避叙利亚武装力量持续不断的炮击而逃离了位于大马士革市郊达尔亚（Darya）镇的家。	Four years ago, Mohammed and his family fled their home in the town of Darya, a suburb of Damascus, to escape relentless bombardment by Syrian armed forces.
虽然位于收入分配金字塔顶端的高学历阶层比以往任何时候都过得更好，但那些只接受过高中教育的人却面临着收入，生活水平和自身及子女发展前景三方面的败退。	While highly educated people at the top of the income distribution are doing better than ever, people with only a high school education face declining incomes, living standards, and prospects for themselves and their children.
这个由中国发起，筹资规模达500亿美元的亚投行将有助于满足亚洲极为庞大，但当今没有任何一个机制性协议有能力提供资金支持的基础设施建设需求。	The $50 billion AIIB, launched by China, will help meet Asia’s enormous infrastructure needs, which are well beyond the capacity of today’s institutional arrangements to finance.
年化积极回报（阿尔法）最高（4.8 % ） 的企业，在实质性问题上表现出色，在非实质性问题上表现较差。	The firms with the highest annualized active return (alpha) of 4.8% were performing well on the material issues and poorly on the immaterial issues.
俄罗斯的压力和破坏作用，以及由此所导致的危机已经在乌克兰社会造成了新的裂缝，并进一步给该国脆弱的经济造成损害。	Russian pressure and destabilization, and the crisis to which they have led, have created new fissures in Ukraine’s society and have caused further damage to its fragile economy.
紧跟其后的是文化大革命的混乱局面。 几百万中国人深受其害，许多人丧生，而在毛泽东试图毁灭那些曾经拯救中国的老一辈革命者时，更多的人表现得极其可耻。	Then the madness of the Cultural Revolution, when millions suffered terribly, many died, and many more behaved disgracefully as Mao sought to destroy those who had rescued China from his earlier follies.
有些悲观派老是说中国GDP增长面临很大压力，和他们的错误论点相反，我认为中国最大的隐患其实是户口制度。	Contrary to the pessimists who have long been wrong about looming threats to China’s GDP growth, I suspect that China’s ultimate undoing could actually be its hukou (household registration) system.
现在，德国基本上达到了充分就业，但工资增速并没有大大超过2 % ， 更不用说近30年前德国上一次出现如此低的失业率（不到4 % ） 时的工资增长率5%了。	Now Germany is practically at full employment, but wages are not increasing at much more than 2% – far lower than the 5% rate that prevailed when Germany last had such low unemployment (below 4%), nearly 30 years ago.
俄罗斯急于向土耳其伸出友谊之手的另一个原因是叙利亚持续不断的冲突，克里姆林宫已经加入军事干预以保护叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德政府。	Another reason why Russia is keen to extend the hand of friendship to Turkey is the ongoing conflict in Syria, in which the Kremlin has intervened militarily to safeguard Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
现在，与其说需要在希腊和西班牙内部采取结构改革，不如说欧元区的设计需要结构改革，并且还需要反思导致这一货币联盟表现如此拙劣的政策框架。	What is needed is not structural reform within Greece and Spain so much as structural reform of the eurozone’s design and a fundamental rethinking of the policy frameworks that have resulted in the monetary union’s spectacularly bad performance.
NPT针对新形势、新问题进行了一系列的调整，这些举措将确保条约持续有效的实施，而这些形势是NPT建立之初所无法预计的。	The evolution of the NPT - its adaptation to new environments and problems that were not anticipated at the time of its adoption - appeared to ensure the Treaty's continuing effective implementation.
事实上，秘鲁的经济增长主要依靠原材料和碳氢化合物出口，已呈现出减速之势，过去三年年增长率高达5.5—6.9 % 。	In fact, Peru’s economic growth – which is based largely on exports of raw materials and hydrocarbons – is already slowing, from annual rates of 5.5-6.9% over the last three years.
坎布里奇—去年波澜壮阔的市场波动在很大程度上要归因于中国增长、欧洲银行和石油过剩等因素的真风险和不确定性。	CAMBRIDGE – The phenomenal market volatility of the past year owes much to genuine risks and uncertainties about factors such as Chinese growth, European banks, and the oil glut.
有一个简单（或许称得上激进）的解决办法：废除就业合同期限的法律规定，将终身职位和资历的处理退还给集体谈判，就像别的地方一样。	There is a simple, if radical, solution: abrogate the legal provisions that regulate the duration of employment contracts, and return the treatment of tenure and seniority to collective bargaining, as is the case elsewhere.
世界只是刚刚开始看到网络战争的影子 — — 伴随2008年格鲁吉亚常规战争的拒绝服务攻击，或者是近期对伊朗离心机的破坏。	The world is only just beginning to see glimpses of cyber war – in the denial-of-service attacks that accompanied the conventional war in Georgia in 2008, or the recent sabotage of Iranian centrifuges.
但中国人早已证明完全没有兴趣站队，因为随着西方企业日益厌恶与俄罗斯做生意，中国将能够买到更多的俄罗斯能源出口、获得更多的新机会，从中渔利。	But the Chinese have proved completely unwilling to pick one camp or the other, as they stand to benefit from more purchases of Russian energy exports and new opportunities as Western firms become more squeamish about doing business in Russia.
问题不仅在于课程的传统内容，如数学、科学和语言上，也在于缺乏重要的“软”技能，如沟通、团队合作和解决问题。	The trouble goes beyond traditional components of the curriculum, like math, science, and language. There is also a deficiency in critical “soft” skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem solving.
对说服能力的系统性研究始于二战，因为美军意识到与被希特勒蛊惑的民族作战需要鼓舞军队士气，并说服民众支持战争。	The systematic study of persuasion began during World War II, when the US Army recognized that fighting a nation mesmerized by Hitler would require bolstering troop motivation and rallying popular support for the war.
果真如此的话，2010年被任命的索比亚宁将获得他至今未能获得的合法性，而反对运动将在首都 — — 纳瓦尔尼政治支持者的主要来源 — — 失去立足点。	In that case, Sobyanin, who was appointed in 2010, would gain the legitimacy that he has lacked until now, and the opposition movement would be discredited in the capital, whose residents form the core of Navalny’s political base.
9·11事件所遭致的反应以及斯特劳斯-卡恩在纽约饭店中与非洲女佣的过节之间毫无共通之处，但在一点上，它们有异曲同工之妙：在卡恩事件中，文化冲突再次起到了误导作用。	The response to 9/11 and to Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s recent encounter with an African chambermaid in a New York hotel have very little in common, except for one thing: once again, cultural conflict was invoked in a misleading way.
即便在法院宣布埃斯特拉达的判决结果前，民意调查仍显示有48%的菲律宾人希望阿罗约能给他特赦，至少也要对他从轻处理。	Even before Estrada’s conviction, opinion polls showed that 48% of Filipinos wanted clemency, if not a guaranteed pardon from Arroyo.
我们需要认识到，真正重要的不是购买越来越多的消费品，而是家人、朋友和明白我们正在用我们的生命做一些有意义的事情。	We need to recognize that what really matters isn’t buying more and more consumer goods, but family, friends, and knowing that we are doing something worthwhile with our lives.
正如在我的新书《非理性充沛》中写的那样，市场似乎是有故事驱动的，同时也存在着伟大新时代和衰退即将逼近的故事，也有一些基本面故事关于技术和资源枯竭的，还有关于政治和令人瞠目结舌的阴谋的故事。	Markets seem to be driven by stories, as I emphasize in my book Irrational Exuberance. There are stories of great new eras and of looming depressions.
20世纪80年代日本“奇迹”的缔造者之一、日本著名经济学家神原英资说 ， “ 我们现在应当仿效韩国 。 ”	“We should now emulate the South Koreans,” says Eisuke Sakakibara, a leading Japanese economist, who was one of the architects of the Japanese “miracle” of the 1980’s.
巴西的卡多佐（Fernando Henrique Cardoso ） 、 秘鲁的加西亚（Alan García ） 、 墨西哥的赛迪罗（Ernesto Zedillo ） 、 哥伦比亚的桑托斯（Juan Manuel Santos ） 、 智利的拉各斯（Ricardo Lagos）和乌拉圭的桑吉内蒂（Julio María Sanguinetti）亦然。	So did Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Alan García of Peru, Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, Ricardo Lagos of Chile, and Julio María Sanguinetti of Uruguay.
然而，自从苏联在1991年解体后，俄罗斯和中国已经开始寻求重新点燃在赫鲁晓夫在1956年谴责斯大林之前，曾经存在在苏联和毛泽东时代的中国之间的亲密关系。	Yet ever since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Russia and China have sought to rekindle the close relations that once supposedly existed between the USSR and Mao’s China before Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin in 1956.
世界银行的多边投资担保局（Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency）和美国政府的海外私人投资公司（Overseas Private Investment Corporation）等政府机构亦然。	So have government institutions, like the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the US government’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
此外，这一时期的基础设施是通过公共部门银行不计后果的鲁莽贷款提供资金，资源常常流向了风险较高、有政治关系的借款人。	Moreover, the infrastructure investments of this period were funded by reckless and imprudent lending by public-sector banks, which often funneled resources to high-risk, politically connected borrowers.
发自伦敦 — — 还在2005年好光景的时候，默文·金 — — 时任以及现任英格兰银行行长 — — 就发言强调维护公众对稳定以及低通胀预期的重要性。	LONDON – Speaking in the happier economic times of 2005, Mervyn King – then, as now, Governor of the Bank of England – stressed the importance of entrenching public expectations of stable, low inflation.
1971年，一切都发生了改变。 美国总统理查德·尼克松因为无法解决因越南战争和社会福利计划扩大所带来的财政赤字，宣布美元不再与黄金保持直接可转换的关系。	Everything changed in 1971, when US President Richard Nixon, unable to contain the fiscal deficit resulting from spending on the Vietnam War and expanded social-welfare programs, abolished the dollar’s direct convertibility to gold.
他在欧盟国歌（贝多芬的“欢乐颂 ” ） 的伴奏下进行了选举后的获胜演讲 — — 这一强有力的姿态极具象征性。	His post-election victory speech in May was accompanied by the EU anthem, Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” – a strong symbolic gesture.
如果欧元 — — 甚至欧盟本身 — — 想要同时保持存续和民主，其政策制定者们就必须更加密切着眼于将决策委托给非民选机构的苛刻条件。	If the euro – and indeed the EU itself – is to remain viable and democratic at the same time, policymakers will have to pay closer attention to the demanding requirements of delegating decisions to unelected bodies.
很难想象欧洲各国的政策差异能在领袖们自我下达的期限内 — — 他们宣称“到下次峰会召开时就能解决 ” — —得到弥合。	It is hard to imagine how Europe’s policy differences can be overcome by the leaders’ self-imposed March deadline, when the next summit will take place.
相反，政治统治者通过受贿或将公共资源分配给家人和朋友而积累起巨额个人财富无论从哪个角度讲都根本无法接受。	By contrast, it is not remotely arguable that political rulers should be able to acquire immense personal wealth through bribery or by distributing public resources to their family and friends.
如果美国因为关于国家身份的文化战争升级而撕裂，那么特朗普拥有不可思议的将分裂双方最糟糕的特点人格化的能力：持枪侠客的目无法纪和城市骗子的强取豪夺。	If the US is riven by an escalating culture war over its national identity, Trump has the uncanny ability of personifying the worst aspects of both sides of the divide: the lawlessness of the gunslinger and the rapaciousness of the city slicker.
为了从美国国库券以外开始多元化，中国今夏向黑石私募股权基金投入30亿美元，但很快就品尝到了投资贬值的尴尬。	Diversification from US Treasury bills by investing some $3 billion in the Blackstone private equity fund this summer was swiftly followed by an embarrassing collapse in value.
这种设计不仅仅是来自于开明的原则，同时也有其必要性：美国需要劝说人们跨越大洋来忍受前线战事以及后来工业化的艰难困苦。	This design was crafted not only from enlightened principle but from necessity: America needed to persuade people to cross the ocean and endure the hardships of the frontier and, later, industrialization.
换句话说，东道国在未经允许的情况下进入外国使团驻地（在我2004—2009年任欧盟驻华盛顿大使以来从未发出过允许 ） ， 或入侵其电脑系统，都将被视为对维也纳公约的公然践踏。	In other words, a host state that enters a foreign mission without consent (none was given in my time as EU Ambassador in Washington, DC, from 2004 to 2009), or hacks into its computer system, would be acting in blatant violation of the Convention.
比如，由于转基因作物不需要施那么多的化学杀虫剂，因此��水流和地下水受污染而中毒的农民家庭越来越少了。	Consider, for example, that, because GM crops require less chemical pesticide, fewer farmers and their families risk being poisoned by runoff into waterways and ground water.
曼哈顿和肯辛顿（Kensington）的晚宴派对上充斥着关于巴塞尔II的细节和顺周期资本要求的弊端的闲言碎语。	Dinner parties in Manhattan and Kensington were consumed with the finer points of Basel II and the evils of procyclical capital requirements.
对来自国外的竞争的恐惧现在具有根本性的影响，它还将会改变全世界发达国家和相对发达的新兴国家的政治进程。	Fear of competition from abroad is now fundamental, and will change the political process in advanced and relatively advanced emerging countries throughout the world.
而这类信用供给问题有可能 — — 事实上，我认为很大机会 — — 在那些“不死巨兽”的问题得到解决之后还继续存在。	And it is possible – indeed, I suspect likely – that such credit-supply problems would exist even if the too-big-to-fail problem were effectively addressed.
在乌干达，从前即使公民发起反对腐败或支持同性恋权利的运动常常面临怀有敌意的公众，也不会因为示威而面临监禁。	In Uganda, although citizens campaigning against corruption or in favor of gay rights often faced a hostile public, they didn’t face jail time for demonstrating.
买家和卖家可以就每笔交易直接商谈价格，商业声誉取决于透明的客户反馈，这带来了持续不断的改善表现的压力。	Buyers and sellers can agree directly on the price of every transaction, and business reputations depend on transparent customer feedback, generating continuous pressure to improve performance.
国际社会可以在这方面大显身手，帮助我国政府监督和控制索马里专属经济区，改善由国际海域巡逻舰队搜集的重要情报的共享。	The international community could make a significant difference in this area, by helping my government monitor and control Somalia’s EEZ, as well as through improved sharing of the critical intelligence gathered by international naval patrols.
人民委员会认为这一拒绝行为是为了施压国王签署这项法律 — — 因此威胁到了王权和国王在泰国的崇高地位。	The People’s Committee viewed this rejection as an attempt to pressure the king into countersigning the law – and thus as a threat to royal prerogatives and the king’s exalted role in Thailand.
我们听到得克萨斯州州长佩里（Rick Perry）拐弯抹角地表示，要是其共和党同僚、美联储主席伯南克胆敢到得州来的话，就会处死他。	We have heard Texas Governor Rick Perry call obliquely for the lynching of his fellow Republican, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, should he come to the Lone Star State.
将军、外交官、国家安全官员和发展专业人士正在形成一个共识，要沿着叙利亚的一段边界设置禁飞的“安全区 ” 。	Generals, diplomats, national-security officials, and development professionals are approaching a consensus in favor of a no-fly “safe zone” along one of Syria’s borders.
卡瓦诺的参议院支持者主要是南部和中西部白人，他们在面对有人批评卡瓦诺鼓吹白人男性具有饮酒和寻欢作乐特权的质疑时全力为他打掩护，反而调转矛头对这位提名人的控诉者发起攻击。	Kavanaugh’s Senate defenders were mainly white men of the South and Midwest who deflected the questioning of Kavanaugh’s white male prerogative to drink and carouse as a young man by instead attacking the nominee’s accusers.
西方学者宣布西方价值观死亡完全正当，而中国或者穆斯林世界中就没有向尼采那样的人说他自己的上帝已经死了。	The Western scholar remains perfectly legitimate when putting to death Western values: there is no Chinese or Muslim Nietzsche claiming that his own God is dead.
激进伊斯兰或圣战主义者是穆斯林，这一事实并不意味着他们的宗教、更不意味着他们的种族和文化天生就是暴力的。	The fact that radical Islamists or jihadists are Muslim does not mean that their religion, not to mention their ethnicity or culture, is inherently violent.
类似地，各国依赖可再生能源的努力也没什么效果，因为被取代的基于化石燃料的能源仍然具有经济吸引力，这意味着会在其他国家或其他时间使用。	Countries’ efforts to rely on renewable energy supplies are similarly ineffective, given that the displaced fossil-fuel-based energy remains economically attractive, which means that it is used elsewhere or later.
同理，在发展中国家普遍实施的小额信贷计划（micro-credit schemes）以非常优惠的还款利率为贫困的人们融资，使他们能够扩展经济事业。	Likewise, micro-credit schemes throughout the developing world have provided finance for the poor to expand their economic enterprise, with repayment rates that are truly impressive.
当世界惊异于中国的经济奇迹时，却对其在过去25年来为实现8-9%的经济年增长率所付出的代价漠不关心。	The world is fascinated by China's economic miracle, but it is much less interested in the costs associated with the country's 8-9% annual growth rate in the past 25 years.
比如希腊和意大利就一直试图通过给零售现金使用额设定上限（分别为1500和1000欧元）来遏制现金使用。	For example, Greece and Italy have been trying to discourage cash use by capping retail cash purchases (at €1,500 and €1,000, respectively).
举例来讲，牛津大学难民研究中心最近的一项分析发现，在乌干达，由难民经营的企业实际上大幅增加了东道国普通民众的就业机会。	For example, a recent analysis by the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford found that in Uganda, refugee-run companies actually increase employment opportunities for citizens by significant margins.
据美国医学研究所的护具，目前美国每年在无必要和低效率医疗服务、管理成本臃肿、价格高企、医疗诈骗和错失预防机会上要浪费7500亿美元以上。	According to the Institute of Medicine, the US currently wastes more than $750 billion per year on unnecessary or inefficient health-care services, excessive administrative costs, high prices, medical fraud, and missed opportunities for prevention.
关于此类事项持往往保守姿态（主要是为了避免得罪各大国政府）的国际货币基金组织估计，中国向非金融企业的贷款中有15％处于危险之中。	The International Monetary Fund, which tends to adopt a conservative posture on such matters (not least to avoid antagonizing powerful governments), estimates that 15% of Chinese loans to nonfinancial corporations are at risk.
在一方面，小国卢森堡老牌首相容克尔是一个稳妥的侯选人。 他对欧盟的政治机器了如指掌，而且主持欧元区的部长会议。	On the one hand, there’s the safe pair of hands personified by Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran prime minister of tiny Luxembourg, who knows the ins and outs of the EU’s political machinery and chairs the euro zone’s ministerial set-up.
联合国难民事务高级专员公署和国际移民组织都能够从加强多边支持中受益，而G20拥有独特的优势完成这项任务。	Both the UNHCR and the IOM could benefit from stronger multilateral support, and the G20 is uniquely poised to offer it.
一年前，美、英、法似乎支持沙特的立场，拒绝了前联合国秘书长科菲·安南邀请伊朗参加日内瓦首次结束叙利亚内战谈判的要求。	A year ago, the US, the UK, and France appeared to side with Saudi Arabia when they rejected former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s request that Iran be invited to the first attempt in Geneva to negotiate a settlement of Syria’s civil war.
解释这种人口趋势其实很简单：全球生育率直线下降，从1950-1955年的每位妇女生5个孩子，下降到2010-2015年的2.5个。	The explanation for this demographic trend is straightforward: global fertility rates have plummeted, from five children per woman, on average, in 1950-1955, to 2.5 children per woman in 2010-2015.
日内瓦 — — 世界卫生组织不久前开始警告一种致命新型病原体X病毒。 事实上，X病毒在现实中并不存在，至少目前还是这样。	GENEVA – The World Health Organization recently began sounding the alarm about a deadly new pathogen called Disease X. In fact, Disease X does not actually exist, at least not yet.
2008年全球发生凶杀案共计418,000起，太多国家有记录的谋杀率达到100，000分之10以上。 世卫组织将其视为一种传染病。	In 2008, there were 418,000 homicides around the world, with far too many countries recording a murder rate of more than 10 per 100,000, which the World Health Organization regards as an epidemic.
同理 ， “ 社会规范”和“分配公平的观念”也往往更有利于那些最有权力或那些能说服他人听命于强权者就是顺从上帝的人。	Similarly, “social norms” and “views about distributive justice” usually turn out to favor whomever has the biggest spear or can convince others that obedience to the powerful is obedience to God.
想要对大银行的这些自吹自擂之声充耳不闻是很困难的，因为银行家最擅长的事情就是将自身利益说成与公共利益完全一致。	It is impossible not to hear in such nonsense the cocksure drumbeat of the Money Power, which has never failed to identify the public interest with its own.
这一点的重要性在最近的国际论坛中反复强调，包括去年8月的第六届东京非洲发展国际会议（TICAD VI）和9月的G20杭州峰会。	The importance of this has been stressed repeatedly at recent international forums, including last August’s Sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD VI), and the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China, the following month.
欧洲安全战略的上述重构 — — 而不止是修补 — — 必须考虑到内部和外部正变得越来越难以区分的事实。	Such a reconceptualization – not just revision – of Europe’s security strategy must account for the fact that the internal and external are becoming increasingly difficult to separate.
针对孟加拉国每年在公共采购上花费超过90亿美元的一项案例研究显示，仅在一个政府部门试行电子采购就降低了12%的价格，从而可以将节省下来的更多资源用于其他重要的预算事项。	A case study in Bangladesh, which spends more than $9 billion on public procurement annually, found that piloting e-procurement in just one government department lowered prices by 12%, leaving more resources for other important budget priorities.
这种倾向已经在他的就职演说中清楚表达了出来。 他在演说中反复提到的“美国优先 ” ， 伴随这一口号在历史上的法西斯主义含义，确认了他实现其最丑恶计划的决心。	That approach was clear from his inaugural address, in which his repeated invocation of “America first,” with its historical fascist overtones, affirmed his commitment to his ugliest schemes.
但这场战争也点燃了人们爱国情绪¾俄国民众普遍希望恢复俄国昔日的帝国尊严与威望，而普京政权察觉到这种情绪并敏锐地加以利用。	But it is also feeding a patriotic emotion – a popular longing for the restoration of Russia’s imperial status and prestige – that Putin’s regime has shrewdly exploited.
纽约 — — 去年，我们有了一段刻骨铭心的经历，随着2008年9月雷曼兄弟的破产，全球金融系统实际上已经崩盘，仅仅靠着人工输血才勉强维持。	NEW YORK – In the last year, we endured a remarkable experience; after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, financial markets actually collapsed and required artificial life support.
2000年，失衡反映在美国的巨额经常项目赤字：世界第一大经济体在国际资本市场上大量借入资金而非借出资金。	In 2000, the imbalance was America’s large current-account deficit: the world’s largest economy was borrowing heavily on international capital markets, rather than lending, as one might expect.
收入和财富不平等性加剧的原因是多样而微妙的；但最近一段时期的极端宽松货币政策所造成的意外后果必须受到指责。	The causes of rising income and wealth inequality are multiple and nuanced; but the unintended consequences of the recent unprecedented period of ultra-loose monetary policy deserves a chunk of the blame.
更为重要的是，这将不让伊朗具有把令世人瞩目的伊斯兰和阿拉伯事业与其自身的霸权主义野心连接起来的能力。	More importantly, it would deny Iran the ability to link popular Islamic and Arab causes with its own hegemonic ambitions.
而我们成功推销的原因并不是因为自己是什么天才人物，是因为我们从所有希望看到波斯尼亚惨剧终结的国家处获得了极大的支持。	We didn’t succeed because we were geniuses. We succeeded because we had tremendous support from every country that wanted to see the horrific conflict in Bosnia brought to an end.
在富内斯7月1日就职典礼之前的内阁成员人选任命之争中，法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线的保守势力不但夺取了主动，甚至威胁要走上街头进行斗争。	In a showdown over the composition of the cabinet just before his inauguration on June 1, the FMLN old guard won, threatening to take the conflict to the streets.
相反，中共坚持认为政府是软实力的主要来源，推广其认为具有全球吸引力的古代文化形象 — — 通常是通过宣传工具进行。	Instead, it has clung to the view that the government is the main source of soft power, promoting ancient cultural icons that it thinks might have global appeal, often using the tools of propaganda.
作为7月发布的美国国民收入和产出账户年度修订工作的一部分，美国商务部统计学家将调低了他们此前对消费支出的估计。	As part of the annual reworking of the US National Income and Product Accounts that was released in July 2011, Commerce Department statisticians slashed their earlier estimates of consumer spending.
与在中东一样，美国与亚洲国家的双边军事关系的对象通常是“亦敌亦友 ” ， 这些国家一方面都与美国建立了盟友关系，另一方面彼此极不信任。	As in the Middle East, America’s bilateral military relationships in Asia are often with “frenemies,” countries that share an alliance with the US while deeply mistrusting one another.
Luis Christiansen的Consultores 21公司、Varianzas公司和Keller公司等多家较中立的调查公司的民调显示，摇摆选民比例惊人地高，他们或者没有表达自己的投票倾向，或者根本不知道该投谁。	Many of the more impartial polling firms, such as Luis Christiansen’s Consultores 21, Varianzas, and Keller, all show a surprisingly large proportion of undecided voters – those who do not answer or do not know for whom they will vote.
相反，邻近的肯尼亚是在殖民统治时期由许多不同的民族或部族形成的，各民族或部族的语言背景和习惯都不相同。	In contrast, neighboring Kenya was formed by colonial rule from dozens of different peoples or tribes, with different linguistic backgrounds and customs.
阿拉伯世界的民主化不但事关推翻独裁者，也事关重画地区政治-种族地图，这个地区有太多的心存不满的少数群体。	Democratization in the Arab world is not only about toppling dictators; it is also about redressing the politico-ethnic map of the region, which has kept too many minority groups dissatisfied.
首先，欧元区危机正在恶化，由于欧元维持强势，前瞻性财政紧缩将会深化多个成员国的衰退，而外围国信贷动荡和高油价又阻挠了复苏前景。	For starters, the eurozone crisis is worsening, as the euro remains too strong, front-loaded fiscal austerity deepens recession in many member countries, and a credit crunch in the periphery and high oil prices undermine prospects of recovery.
诺贝尔经济学早就授予过给一些可被归类为行为经济学家的人，包括乔治·阿卡洛夫（George Akerlof ） ， 罗伯特·福格尔（Robert Fogel ） ， 丹尼尔·卡尼曼（Daniel Kahneman ） ， 埃里诺·奥斯特伦（Elinor Ostrom）和我本人。	The economics Nobel has already been awarded to a number of people who can be classified as behavioral economists, including George Akerlof, Robert Fogel, Daniel Kahneman, Elinor Ostrom, and me.
将一个人生活的一部分隔离开，并在这些界限之内保持主权和自我驱动，这种能力是自由人及其与公共领域关系的自由概念的核心。	A capacity to fence off a part of one’s life, and to remain sovereign and self-driven within those boundaries, was paramount to the liberal conception of the free agent and his or her relationship with the public sphere.
事实上我们最近的估算就显示，如果各北欧经济体无法在人工智能推广上跟上邻国的步伐，那么其GDP年增长率可能会下降0.5个百分点。	In fact, we recently estimated that northern European economies could lose 0.5 percentage points of annual GDP growth if they do not keep pace with their neighbors in adopting AI.
他的批评对逊尼派阿拉伯领导人来说不啻天籁之音，他们不但将伊朗视为魔鬼，更认为它是伊拉克什叶派复兴的根源。	His remarks were music to the ears of Sunni Arab leaders, who regard Iran as the root of all evil, and the source of the Shia resurgence in Iraq.
只要中国的经济继续增长，它的军事力量就很有可能加强，这将会使中国看起来对其邻国更具危险性，使美国在亚洲的事务变得更为复杂化。	As long as China’s economy does grow, its military power will likely increase, thus making China appear more dangerous to its neighbors and complicating America’s commitments in Asia.
欧洲的竞争法尤其允许政策制定者随意干涉，从而增加了不确定性，破坏了财富的创造并且损害了消费者的利益。	European competition law in particular allows policymakers to intervene at will, increasing uncertainty, damaging wealth creation and consumer well-being.
但是，众所周知，某些变异可以发生于家族中，显著增加罹患某些疾病的风险 — — 比如乳腺癌、镰状细胞贫血和囊细胞纤维症。	But it is widely known that certain mutations can run in families, increasing dramatically the risks of certain diseases – for example, breast cancer, sickle-cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis.
最新的奎利安姆基金会（Quilliam Foundation）报告认为，达伊莎利用青年的渴望作为价值的一部分；该组织的乌托邦诉求是对新圣战斗士吸引力最大的东西。	As a recent Quilliam Foundation report concludes, Daesh plays on the youthful desire to be part of something worthwhile; it is the organization’s utopian appeal that is most alluring to new recruits.
如此，我们可以得到一个简单的结论：欧元区长期稳定更加取决于完整的欧洲银行联盟计划，而不是为欧元区建立新的预算。	This leads to a simple conclusion: The euro’s long-term stability depends far more on completing plans for a European banking union than it does on creating some new budget for the eurozone.
此外，即使在全球平均气温升幅限制在前工业化水平以上2摄氏度以内（2015年巴黎气候协定制定的上限）的情形中，化石燃料仍有必要生产。	Also, even in a scenario in which the average global temperature increase is kept within 2° Celsius of pre-industrial levels (the upper limit under the 2015 Paris climate agreement), fossil fuels will still need to be produced.
众议院议长保罗·莱恩（Paul Ryan）和参议院共和党领导层在贸易、移民和预算赤字等问题上的观点都要比特朗普更加接近共和党主流。	House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership in the Senate have more mainstream GOP views than Trump on trade, migration, and budget deficits.
英国克雅氏病调查局后来的流行病学研究表明：感染了变异型克雅氏病的个体可能比对照组的病人食用了更多的肉制品，这进一步证明了两者之间的联系。	Subsequent epidemiological studies in the NCJDSU indicate that individuals with variant CJD are likely to have consumed more meat products than control patients, further supporting a link between these disorders.
面对因而产生的债务通缩，爱尔兰最强大的武器在于可以招徕各大美国科技巨头，为它们提供一整套包括欧盟法律，训练有素会讲英语的劳动力，以及12.5％的企业所得税的组合。	Ireland’s greatest weapon against the ensuing debt deflation was its ability to attract US-based tech giants, by offering them a combination of EU law, a well-trained English-speaking workforce, and a 12.5% corporate-tax rate.
加州克莱蒙特 — — 40年前美国总统理查德·尼克松踏上访华之路时，他不可能想象到自己这次赌博会释放多大能量。	CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – When US President Richard Nixon embarked on his historic trip to China 40 years ago, he could not have imagined what his gamble would unleash.
资本在二十一世纪重新点燃了经济学家对财富及其分配态势的兴趣。 亚当·斯密、大卫·李嘉图和卡尔·马克思等古典经济学家都曾关注同样的话题。	Capital in the Twenty-First Century has reignited economists’ interest in the dynamics of wealth and its distribution – a topic that preoccupied classical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx.
设计合理的获取和受益分享机制为贫穷国家提供了机会。 这些国家拥有全球剩余基因资源的一大部分，可以开始为维持这些资源而接收报偿。	An intelligently designed ABS regime offers the chance for poorer countries, which possess the lion’s share of the globe’s remaining genetic resources, to begin to be paid properly for maintaining them.
即使是联合国最忠实的支持者，现在也开始意识到，如果联合国要对国际和平与安全做出重要贡献的话，就必须有所改变。	Even the UN’s most ardent supporters now recognize that change is called for if the organization is to make a significant contribution to international peace and security.
主要由反对大幅削减食品和燃料补贴的工人阶级年轻人发动的示威很快就演变成对伊朗神权政体的反对，示威者高唱《哈梅内伊去死》就是明证。 哈梅内伊是伊朗伊斯兰共和国最高领袖。	Protests staged by mostly working-class young men against deep reductions in food and fuel subsidies quickly evolved into demonstrations against Iran’s theocracy, reflected in chants of “Death to Ali Khamenei,” the Islamic Republic’s supreme leader.
他还承诺要废除对水力压裂的限制、开放更多的公共土地用于煤炭开采，并扩大北极和大西洋海域的石油和天然气生产。	He has also vowed to repeal limits on fracking, open up more public lands to coal mining, and expand oil and gas production in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.
哥伦比亚政府还急需根据2016年结束半个世纪残酷内战的和平条约，安置大约25,000名FARC游击队员和他们的家庭。	And the government must also urgently reintegrate some 25,000 FARC guerillas and their families under the terms of the 2016 peace treaty that ended a half-century of brutal civil war.
从2004~2014年间美国制造业的就业人数减少了近200多万，目前仅占总就业人数的8％多一点 — — 这也延续了自1950年代以来的持续下降趋势。	Employment in manufacturing fell by more than two million from 2004 to 2014, and now accounts for just over 8% of total employment – continuing a long decline since the 1950s.
讽刺的是，英国政府 — — 毫无疑问，它正在竭力摆出欢迎外国投资者的姿态 — — 在帮忙给中国金融机构以及更广义的中国经济挖陷阱。	Ironically, the British government, while no doubt just trying to be hospitable to foreign investors by laying out a red carpet, is helping to set a trap for Chinese financial institutions – and the broader Chinese economy.
新兴市场的牛市表明大多数主要中等收入国家都已经切实降低了自身的公共负债/GDP比率，并使之获得了过去所缺少的财政空间。	Emerging-market bulls point out that most major middle-income countries have substantially lowered their public debt/GDP ratios, giving them fiscal space that they lacked in the past.
中国还在其邻近东亚的战略利益范围之外实施了一系列外交举措，并积极参与到了2015年伊朗核协定等外交倡议之中。	China has also launched diplomatic initiatives beyond its immediate sphere of strategic interest in East Asia, as well as actively participating in initiatives such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
比如，印度和英国已经有过强势的女性首相 — — 英迪拉·甘地和玛格丽特·撒切尔，但如今必须与成功女性的“巾帼不让须眉”原型作斗争。	India and Britain, for example, have had strong women prime ministers in Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher, but now must grapple with the “woman-as-man” archetype of female success.
此外，一旦误判根深蒂固地竖立起来，要想纠正就变得极其困难 — — 特别是在问题的主题并不在专家专业知识范围内的时候。	Moreover, it is extremely difficult to correct misperceptions once they ossify – particularly if the topic in question is outside a pundit’s range of expertise.
2008年 ， 《 连线 》 （ Wired）杂志编辑克里斯·安德森（Chris Anderson）提出大数据最终将揭示一切真理，不再需要科学或理论。	In 2008, Wired editor Chris Anderson suggested that big data would eventually reveal all truth, without requiring science or theory.
（里奇曼是一位政治历史学家，他因为设计了一个成功预测从罗纳德·里根到唐纳德·特朗普的所有当选总统的模型而闻名于世。 ）	(A political historian, Lichtman is famous for having devised a model that has enabled him to predict the election of every American president from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.)
其次，特朗普政府估算，如果不采取行动，到2100年全球气温将升高3.5℃。 这些假设引起了激烈的批评。	Second, the administration estimates that global temperatures will increase by 3.5° Celsius (6.3° Fahrenheit) by 2100 if no action is taken.
人工智能以大数据为基础，而数据的可获得性从根本上讲是一个政治问题，涉及诸如隐私，透明度，安全性和框定经济竞争的规则等问题。	AI is based on big data, and the availability of data is fundamentally a political matter that implicates issues such as privacy, transparency, security, and the rules that frame economic competition.
它们放任全球失衡日积月累，亲切地看着巨大的信用泡沫产生，忽视按揭市场所闪现的危险信号，不假思索地赞美薪酬过高的投资银行家所创造的创新但有毒的金融产品。	They allowed global imbalances to build up, looked benignly on a massive credit bubble, ignored flashing danger signs in the mortgage market, and uncritically admired the innovative but toxic products devised by overpaid investment bankers.
如果未来拒绝为现在健康的人支付某些昂贵的治疗费用（比如血液透析 ） ， 并把节省下来的款项分配给廉价然而有效的预防计划，那么千千万万条统计生命，你自己的生命也许也包括在内，就都能够得到挽救。	Many statistical lives – your own, perhaps – could be saved by excluding future payment for some expensive medical treatment (say, hemodialysis) for those who are now healthy and reallocating the funds to cheap but effective prevention programs.
在新的中东尘埃落定之前，旧的路线图似乎已经过时，传统智慧认为值此区域动荡之际想就和平协议取得进展不过是一厢情愿的痴心妄想。	Until the dust settles on the new Middle East, the old roadmaps seem dated, and conventional wisdom holds that progress toward a peace agreement in the face of regional upheaval is wishful thinking.
在科特迪瓦首都阿比让，非洲开发银行投资的价值2，300万美元的古鲁盆地综合流域管理项目大大减少了古鲁盆地的洪灾次数，并显著改善了280万居民的生活。	In Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, the $23 million AfDB-funded Gourou Basin Integrated Watershed Management Project significantly reduced flooding throughout the Gourou Basin, and improved 2.8 million inhabitants’ livelihoods.
从表面看来气候模式的急剧变化¾包括格陵兰冰川融化和西伯利亚永久冻土融解¾至少说服了绝大多数企业领导现在应该采取行动。	Seemingly dramatic changes in weather patterns – including the melting of glaciers in Greenland and the thawing of the Siberian permafrost – have at last convinced most business leaders that the time for action is now.
但是金砖五国的故事可不仅限于此：金砖五国在应对抗菌素耐药性议题上的重要性跟应对耐药性对于这五国的重要性是等同的。	But there is more to the story: the BRICS are just as important to tackling AMR as tackling AMR is to the BRICS.
许多观察家认为，其他国家正在通过在投资，贸易和援助基础上构建与个别国家的依赖性来破坏东盟的意见一致性。	Many observers believe that other countries are undermining ASEAN unanimity by developing dependencies with individual countries, built on investment, trade, and assistance.
2016年6月，阿布扎比国际石化投资公司和穆巴达拉发展公司（Mubadala Development Company）宣布合并。 这两家投资公司的目标和策略完全不同，它们的合并也拉开了变化的序幕。	The June 2016 announcement of a merger between Abu Dhabi’s International Petroleum Investment Company and Mubadala Development Company – two entities that had quite different objectives and strategies – heralded another change.
据数字广告公司Fractl的研究，大约85%的千禧一代会把收入的一部分储蓄起来 — — 这一比例要高于他们的前辈。	According to research by the digital ad agency Fractl, approximately 85% of millennials are saving a portion of their paycheck – a larger percentage than their predecessors.
包括我本人所在机构进行的各项调查结果一致表明，企业领导人对于必须平等对待男女劳动者已经有了明确的认识。	Surveys – including those conducted by my own organization – consistently show that business leaders understand the need for equal treatment of men and women in the workforce.
随着世界各国政府和人民越来越意识到中国可以用自己巨大的财富买来影响力之时，一场反华运动是否已经无法避免？	As governments and citizens around the world become aware of the influence that China can buy with its deep pockets, is an anti-Chinese backlash inevitable?
政府显然应该在支持新技术的开发中扮演角色，液压致裂法就是一例；但是，当技术已经成熟时，就没有理由要求某种天然气的生产方式应该通过税收减免的形式予以补贴。	Governments certainly have a role to play in supporting the development of new technologies, such as fracking; but, once the technology has been developed, there is no reason why one form of gas production should be subsidized via tax breaks.
然而，如果巴西要超越过去几年间在经济上取得的增长水准，就迫切需要改革它的劳工法律，对外贸更加开放，以及提高它的基础教育体系的质量。	Yet, if Brazil is to enjoy growth above the modest levels of the past few years, the country badly needs to reform its labor laws, open itself more to foreign trade, and improve the quality of its primary education system.
类似地，英国的保守党政府 — — 它支持退欧的民粹主义目的 — — 最近也宣布了新一轮数十亿英镑规模的社会保障、教育和工作阶级税收优惠削减。	Similarly, Britain’s Tory government, which has espoused Brexit’s populist aims, has recently announced another multi-billion-pound reduction in social security, education, and tax credits for the working poor.
人们吸引他人的能力参差不齐，这些能力一部分取决于内在特性，一部分来自于所学的技能，最后一部分则来源自当时的社会大背景。	People vary in their ability to attract others, and their attraction depends partly on inherent traits, partly on learned skills, and partly on social context.
此外，正如实际情形所显示的，如果德国是在和其欧元区伙伴玩一场危险的胆小鬼博弈，那么为何要把成本转移给IMF，而使欧洲最大最成功的经济体获益？	And if, as appears to be the case, Germany is playing a dangerous game of chicken with some of its eurozone partners, why should the cost be shifted to the IMF for the benefit of Europe’s largest and most successful economy?
我们决不能坐视独裁者、威权派和民主选举总统仅凭错觉和心血来潮就控制核武器 — — 这与性别没有关系。	Nuclear weapons cannot be left to the whims and fancies of dictators, authoritarians, and democratically elected presidents – gender notwithstanding.
自1800年以来，全球经济已经经历了多次这样的周期，在任意一年，独立国家经历重组的比例在零和50%之间波动（见图 ） 。	Since 1800, the global economy has endured several such cycles, with the share of independent countries undergoing restructuring during any given year oscillating between zero and 50% (see figure).
关于财政操作空间的辩论实际上很快会变成另一种辩论，即过去能够轻易获得融资的国家将来是否仍然有此能力。	The debate about room for fiscal maneuver in practice soon becomes a debate about whether countries that have easily financed debt in the past can automatically continue to do so.
而旧金山正在与一个名为“转折点 ” （ Tipping Point）的非盈利组织合作以提供更多经济适用住房和预防性计划。	And San Francisco is collaborating with the non-profit organization Tipping Point to provide more affordable housing units and preventive programs.
但没有迹象表明准备对其进行评估 — — 即使不足以找出毫无争议的最佳模式，评估至少能有助于各国做选择时拥有更加全面的信息。	But there is no sign of a considered assessment being prepared, which might at least help countries to make better-informed choices, even if it did not conclude that one model was unambiguously best.
美联储各会员银行超出货币需求量的总储备额在1932年时为2.56亿美元，1933年为5.28亿美元，1934年上升到16亿美元，最后在1936年堆积到26亿 。 ”	Reserves of member banks at Fed were $256 million more than required in 1932; $528 million in 1933, $1.6 billion in 1934, $2.6 billion in 1936.”
空气污染就像一颗定时炸弹：全球微粒浓度最高的的15个城市中有14个在印度，彰显出转向低碳电池驱动交通工具的紧迫性。	Air pollution is a ticking bomb: 14 of the 15 cities with the world’s highest concentrations of fine particulate matter are in India, underscoring the urgency of switching to low-carbon, battery-powered vehicles.
人类学家海伦·费舍尔 《爱的解析》 是上述研究中最著名的一项，它解释了人类求爱、结婚、通奸、离婚和抚养子女倾向背后存在的进化动力。	The most famous of these studies, anthropologist Helen Fisher’s The Anatomy of Love , explains the evolutionary impetus for human tendencies in courtship, marriage, adultery, divorce, and childrearing.
我无法忘记其中一位巴勒斯坦制作团队成员所说的话 ： “ 这是逼婚 ， ” 他说当时自己一直在呼吁制作一个只有巴勒斯坦角色的《芝麻街 》 ， “我们一直想拆伙 。 ”	One quote from a Palestinian TV production team member stayed with me: “This is a shotgun wedding,” he explained when he was advocating for a Palestine-only Sesame Street. “And we want a divorce.”
这些毒品，再加上从缅甸运输到印度、中国、泰国和该地区其他国家的的海洛因，对我们的政治和经济安全造成严重威胁。	That, together with the heroin that is trafficked from Burma to India, China, Thailand, and other countries in the region, poses a serious threat to our political and economic security.
而哈翁最幸运的地方莫过于比对手凯恩斯多活了近50年，虽然后者在世时在学术上对他大肆抨击，但他却最终赢得了一场后发制人的胜利。	His great good fortune was to outlive Keynes by almost 50 years, and thus to claim a posthumous victory over a rival who had savaged him intellectually while he was alive.
基辛格与中国客户有不少私人接触，他与自己的长期对手兹比格涅夫·布热津斯基共同提出了一种学说，这对越来越厌倦帝国负担及全球两大国现状的美国很有吸引力。	Kissinger works personally with the Chinese account, jointly propounding with his long-time rival Zbigniew Brzezinski the notion, so seductive for an America growing weary of its imperial burden, of a global Big Two.
17%的英国家庭买不起能源 — — 换句话说他们被迫把10%的收入花在能源上；而且因为老年人经济能力普遍较差，约有四分之一的老年家庭陷入能源贫穷。	Some 17% of households are now energy poor – that is, they have to spend more than 10% of their income on energy; and, because elderly people are typically poorer, about a quarter of their households are energy poor.
有一点显而易见，那就是在美国积极寻求全球霸权的情况下，一个与邻国有着良好关系的统一强大的欧洲恐怕很难真正符合亲密的跨大西洋联盟的需要。	What does seem clear is that a cohesive and strong Europe on good terms with its neighbors will not fit easily into a close transatlantic alliance with an America actively pursuing global hegemony.
但如果大国之间发生了分裂的话，那么即便是G20这样的网络组织也无法为联合国或者布雷顿森林金融机构设定议程。	But if major countries are divided, it is unlikely that even network organizations like the G-20 can set the agenda for the UN and the Bretton Woods financial institutions to act upon.
国际货币政策的标准三元悖论认为，一国不可能同时满足固定汇率、货币独力和自由资本流动，但它们可以实现其中两者。	The standard trilemma of international monetary policy holds that countries cannot have fixed exchange rates, monetary independence, and free capital movement simultaneously, but they can have two of the three.
西方不得不重新采取这样的做法，或者冒险在极右和极左政治���力巩固地位及中产阶级开始消失的过程中丧失全球优势。	The West will have to re-adopt such an approach, or risk losing out globally as its ultra-right and ultra-left political forces consolidate their positions and its middle classes begin to dissolve.
事实上，虽然州政府在高等教育公共支出方面占了大头，但联邦政府通过向学生提供担保贷款和助学金承担了上述开支的很大份额。	Indeed, while states account for the bulk of public spending on higher education, the federal government finances a big share of that spending via guaranteed loans and grants to students.
事实上，由于商品价格偏低，世界可能将于2009年目睹俄罗斯和巴西的准衰退，中国和印度则会大大放慢速度，这对于这些国家来说就等同于硬着陆（增长大大低于潜能 ） 。	Indeed, the world should expect a near recession in Russia and Brazil in 2009, owing to low commodity prices, and a sharp slowdown in China and India that will be the equivalent of a hard landing (growth well below potential) for these countries.
由于希特勒试图屠杀所有犹太人所造成的心理创伤，种族灭绝已经成为了一个采取军事行动 — — 包括武装侵略其他国家 — — 的最有力理由。	Because of the trauma of Hitler’s intention to murder all of the Jews, genocide has become the one compelling reason for military action, including armed invasion of other countries.
中国官员也许不必向民主选举的议会或国会负责，但政府官员仍然有一个机构 — — 七人组成的政治局常务委员会 — — 可以问责失败。	Chinese officials may not be answerable to a democratically elected parliament or congress; but government officials do have a unitary body – the seven-member standing committee of the Politburo – to which they must account for their failures.
对民族主义和中国的自尊 — — 以及美国自身在处理对华关系时的指导思想 — — 之间的关系视而不见将让美国付出更加沉重的代价。	Being blind to the connection between nationalism and dignity in China – and in America’s own conduct when dealing with China – may cost the US even more.
即使一点不为斯大林辩护，人们也必须承认苏联对二战盟军胜利的巨大贡献 — — 包括2，600万民众为此献出生命。	Without defending Stalin, one must recognize the immense Soviet contribution – including the lives of 26 million citizens – to the Allied victory in WWII.
而在外国投资者中，壳牌和英国石油天然气控股公司（TNK－BP）都被俄国天然气工业股份公司挤出了俄国国内的主要天然气田。	Among foreign investors, both Shell and TNK-BP are being pushed out by Gazprom in their main gas fields in Russia.
她们写道 ： “ 有大量的证据表明发展中国家低技能劳动者的状况总体并未改善，或至少并未获得与高技能高教育水平劳动者同样的改善 。 ”	“There is overwhelming evidence,” they write, “that less-skilled workers in developing countries “are generally not better off, at least not relative to workers with higher skill or education levels.”
如果加沙地带变成一个非法的失败国家，成为一个针对以色列发动攻击的基地，那么要劝说以色列从其他占领地区撤军就会变得困难至极。	If Gaza turns into a lawless failed state, one that is a base for attacks on Israelis, it will be extremely difficult to persuade Israel to withdraw from other areas that it now occupies.
除去技术和投资以外，格雷厄姆还在不知不觉间为奥巴马政府提出了外交政策建议，这个建议肯定非常符合克林姆林的胃口：即实现乌克兰的“芬兰化 ” 。	In addition to the technology and investments, Graham quietly slips in a foreign policy suggestion for the Obama administration that is sure to please the Kremlin: “Finlandizing” Ukraine.
世界对一个全球霸权架构的顺从 — — 也就是由全球势力维护一个世界秩序的状况 — — 在冷战后幸存了下来。	The world’s acclimation to a global hegemonic structure – in which world powers guarantee an international order – survived the Cold War.
流行的意见是允许银行发行“或有资本 ” （ 在发生系统性危机是转变为股权的债务 ） ， 该意见比承诺发生危机时严惩银行的方案可信得多。	The fashionable idea of allowing banks to issue “contingent capital” (debt that becomes equity in a systemic crisis) is no more credible than the idea of committing to punish banks severely in the event of a crisis.
这也不是要否认斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）等进步人士和辛恩（Hans-Werner Sinn）等保守人士对援助条款的经济学批评。	Neither is it to deny the economic criticism of the bailout provisions presented by progressives like Joseph Stiglitz and conservatives like Hans-Werner Sinn.
事实上 ， “ 政治冷，经济热”概括了亚洲的现状：各国在制定外交政策时无法克服历史仇恨、承认更好的关系会带来更好的经济。	In fact, serei keinetsu defines the Asian status quo: countries that cannot seem to overcome their historical animosities when it comes to foreign policy readily acknowledge that better relations means better economies.
如果没有上述举措，那么人们充其量可以预见长期的增长低迷和衰退，长期低利率及通缩环境可能加剧杠杆，导致下行风险累积。	In the absence of such an approach, one can foresee an extended period of low and fragile growth, at best, with downside risks stemming from increased leverage in a prolonged low-interest-rate and deflationary environment.
首先，搁置家庭控制是否是一种权利这一“意识形态”问题不谈，压倒性证据表明无法获得避孕手段有损于妇女的健康。	"First, leaving aside the “ideological"" question of whether family planning is a right, there is overwhelming evidence to show that a lack of access to contraception is bad for women's health."
知识分子之所以自愿与埃尔多安及葛兰分子联盟是因为相信由军队控制国家机构 — — “军事监护 ” — —是土耳其民主制度最大的威胁。	What made these intellectuals willing allies of Erdoğan and the Gülenists was their view that the military’s control of state institutions – “military tutelage” – posed the greatest obstacle to democracy in Turkey.
巴黎—1948年，联合国大会通过了世界人权宣言，肯定了“人民的意愿 ” — —民主 — — 应该成为政府的基础。	PARIS – On December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirming the view that “the will of the people” – democracy – should form the basis of any government.
这代表着一种对于一部分思想家的严肃挑战。 他们有时嘲讽民族的概念本身，认为我们现在生活在一个“后民族”的世界。	This represents a serious challenge to thinkers who sometimes ridicule the idea of the nation itself, arguing that we now inhabit a “post-national” world.
这些观点经常引用弗里德曼的话。 他在1998年警告说，欧洲实行欧元的承诺将会在第一场严重的经济衰退中受到考验。	Such arguments often invoke Milton Friedman, who warned in 1998 that Europe’s commitment to the euro would be tested by the first serious economic downturn.
病毒可能仅仅是几百行计算机代码，但防毒程序的长度却至少成千上万，因为防毒程序的设计必须能够发现各式各样的敌人。	A virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code, compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-virus programs, which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies.
2010年量化宽松开始时，消费物价指数上涨1.6 % ， 2011年和2012年有所增加，2013年（资产购买高峰之年）回落至1.5 % 。	The consumer price index rose by 1.6% in 2010, when quantitative easing began, then increased somewhat faster in 2011 and 2012, before dropping back to a gain of just 1.5% in 2013, the peak year for asset purchases.
这种失败并不意味着世界多数民众在这些问题上没有共同点，也不意味着他们无法做出及时、甚至是勇敢的决策。	These failures do not mean that most people around the world do not see eye-to-eye on these issues, or that they are unprepared to make timely, even courageous, decisions.
他通过迎合密歇根、宾夕法尼亚和威斯康星这三个铁锈州所出现的民粹主义愤怒而赢得了大选 — — 这三个州此前曾是民主党的票仓。	He won the election by appealing to populist resentment in three Rust Belt states – Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin – that had previously voted Democratic.
瑞典和德国接纳了大部分来自叙利亚和其他地方的寻求庇护者，而其他大部分欧盟成员国只接纳了极少数或一个人都没有接纳。	Sweden and Germany have taken in the majority of asylum seekers from Syria and elsewhere, while most other EU member states have admitted few or none.
现实是，欧盟可以因为其处理危机的方式而被批评；但你不能指责它造成了助长2008年以来的经济灾难的全球经济失衡。	The reality is that the EU can be criticized for the way it handled the crisis; but it cannot be blamed for the global economic imbalances that have fueled economic strife since 2008.
与此同时，中国净对外资产只有GDP的14.7 % ， 日本为67.5 % ， 德国为48.3 % （ 美国为-41 % ） 。	Meanwhile, China’s net foreign assets amounted to only 14.7% of GDP, compared to 67.5% for Japan and 48.3% for Germany (negative 41% of GDP for the US).
乌克兰一直在敦促俄罗斯开始就舰队撤离一事进行商议，但俄罗斯一直拖拉，这暗示了莫斯科想要利用其舰队在乌克兰的驻扎，作为向乌克兰施压的手段。	Ukraine has been pressing Russia to begin discussions on the fleet's withdrawal. But Russia has dragged its feet, suggesting that Moscow may seek to use the presence of the fleet as a means of pressuring Ukraine.
全民公决时，北部250,000名土族塞浦路斯人约三分之二支持安南计划，但南部860,000名希族塞浦路斯人却有76%表示反对。	When put to a referendum, roughly two-thirds of the island’s 250,000 Turkish Cypriots in the north supported the Annan Plan, but 76% of the 860,000 Greek Cypriots in the south rejected it.
当外国政府太愚蠢以至于拒绝美国道路时，他们应该因为伤害美国的利益（普世利益的代名词）进而威胁美国安全而受到惩罚。	When foreign governments are foolish enough to reject the American way, they should expect retribution for harming US interests (seen to align with universal interests) and thereby threatening US security.
不幸的是，由于中国已经在世界货物出口中占据很大比重（2004年为10.4 % ） ，同时西方经济停滞又束缚着外部需求，出口导向战略难再奏效。	Unfortunately, as China has already claimed a large share of the world’s merchandise exports (10.4% in 2010) and economic stagnation in the West is constraining external demand, this strategy can no longer work.
布达佩斯 — — 6月17日的希腊议会重新选举不过是自20世纪60年代以来困扰西方民主和开放社会的严重危机的最新症状而已。	BUDAPEST – The re-run of the Greek parliamentary election on June 17 is only the latest symptom of the most serious crisis to plague Western democracies and open societies since the 1960’s.
这是回归理应成为国际社会主要关注点的问题的唯一办法 — — 结束叙利亚人民所受到的灾难，为他们重建国家，向他们提供建设应该获得的和平未来的机会。	This is the only way to return to what should be the international community’s main concern: ending the suffering of the Syrian population, restoring their country to them, and offering them the chance to construct the peaceful future they deserve.
在最新预算中，联邦政府2010年用于Medicare计划的支出预计将超过5000亿美元，而Medicaid则将耗费纳税人2500亿美元。	In the most recent budget, the federal government’s outlays for Medicare in 2010 are projected to be over $500 billion, while Medicaid will cost taxpayers over $250 billion.
但也有可能出于这样一种担忧，即运用条约与中国台湾立场相矛盾的法律推理解决当前领土争端将削弱中国的地位和公信力。	But it could also stem from concerns that using the treaty’s legal reasoning, which conflicts with China’s stance on Taiwan, to resolve today’s territorial disputes would undermine its credibility and weaken its position.
毕竟，中国的发展战略依赖于继续融入世界经济 — — 具体而言，依赖于可靠的获得美国市场和技术的方式。	After all, China’s development strategy depends on its continued integration into the world economy – and, specifically, reliable access to American markets and technology.
两年半前，荷兰政府联手IBM和一批中小型本地企业在德文格洛（荷兰射电天文研究所所在地）最北部的村庄里快速启动了大规模数据中心项目。	Two and a half years ago, the Dutch government teamed up with IBM and a group of small and medium-size local businesses to jumpstart a big-data hub in the far-northern village of Dwingeloo, home to the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy.
这是深度脱碳方案计划（DDPP）的主要宗旨，该计划已经动员16个最大温室气体排放国的研究团队制定截止本世纪中叶的国家深度脱碳方案。	This is the main message of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP), which has mobilized research teams in 16 of the largest greenhouse-gas emitters to prepare national Deep Decarbonization Pathways to mid-century.
随着美国2016年总统竞选活动的逐步深入，许多选民确信 — — 系统被人“操纵 ” ， 他们这样的想法也并非全无理由。	In the US, as the 2016 presidential campaign got underway, many voters clearly believed – not without reason – that the system was “rigged.”
上个月，我向国际原子能机构理事会提出了关于强化不扩散机制的关键措施的建议 — — 即创立一家国际原子能机构低浓缩铀 (LEU)银行，以保证对那些需要核燃料来维持其核能反应堆运转的国家的供应。	Last month, I proposed a key measure to strengthen non-proliferation to the IAEA’s Board of Governors – establishing an IAEA bank of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to guarantee supplies to countries that need nuclear fuel for their power reactors.
不仅如此，特朗普已经暗示如果习近平能协助控制朝鲜政权的核野心，他或将以某种方式软化在贸易问题上的立场。	Meanwhile, Trump has implied that he might somehow soften his stance on the trade issue if Xi offers to help rein in the North Korean regime’s nuclear ambitions.
它没有持续干预外汇市场（至少没有贬值货币 ） ， 总经常项目盈余也没有大于或等于GDP的3 % （ 2017年盈余为1.3 % ） 。	It has not been persistently intervening in foreign-exchange markets (at least not to push down its currency), and it is not running an overall current-account surplus greater than or equal to 3% of GDP (its surplus in 2017 was 1.3%).
在一些政治家和商业领袖中，如果竞争被认为是不公平的，那么欧盟委员会就应该召集使用新的保护贸易的措施，这几乎成为他们的一种本能反应。	It is almost an instinct among some politicians and business leaders that if competition is deemed unfair, the European Commission should marshal new trade defenses.
无论何时，只要俄方施加压力，卢卡申科立即开始抱怨莫斯科方面的“忘恩负义 ” — —类似大肆渲染“一千万白俄罗斯人正保卫俄罗斯避免北约坦克的进犯 ” 。	Whenever Russia applies pressure, he immediately starts yelling about Moscow’s “ingratitude” – proclaiming that “10,000,000 Belarusians protect Russia from NATO’s tanks.”
该文章在上个月IMF年会结束后几天寿命而作。 在IMF年会上，法国财政部长米歇尔·萨宾（Michel Sapin）和经济部长艾曼努尔·马科伦（Emmanuel Macron）和他们的德国同侪沃尔夫冈·朔伊布勒（Wolfgang Schäuble）和西格玛尔·加布里埃尔（Sigmar Gabriel）举行了会晤。	The paper was commissioned a few days after the IMF’s Annual Meetings last month, at a gathering of the French finance and economy ministers, Michel Sapin and Emmanuel Macron, and their German counterparts, Wolfgang Schäuble and Sigmar Gabriel.
最终，亚的斯亚贝巴行动日程（Addis Ababa Action Agenda）规定，目前的专家委员会将继续根据其2004年的权限行使功能，每年增加三次会议，完全以自愿捐款的方式筹集资金。	In the end, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda provides that the current Committee of Experts will continue to function according to its 2004 mandate, with three additional meeting days per year, all funded through voluntary contributions.
63岁的莫迪在软民族主义、市场经济和新亚洲主义等方面都与安倍一致，寻求与亚洲民主国家展开密切合作，创造严丝合缝的战略合作网。	The 63-year-old Modi mirrors Abe’s soft nationalism, market-oriented economics, and new Asianism, seeking close ties with Asian democracies to create a web of interlocking strategic partnerships.
然而，还有许多其它的自然资本未被包含在其中：淡水、土壤、提供生态服务的森林和吸纳微粒、氮氧化物和硫氧化物等污染物的大气。	Many types of natural capital, however, have not been included: fresh water, soil, forests as providers of ecosystem services, and the atmosphere as a sink for such pollution as particulates and nitrogen and sulphur oxides.
今年10月， 来自44个国家的128名人权和平等领域的著名专家，开展了一项里程碑式工作，我们要在1948年联合国具有划时代意义的声明的基础上，建立普遍的人类平等。	This October, 128 leading experts in the fields of human rights and equality from 44 countries launched a landmark attempt to build on the epochal 1948 UN declaration to establish universal human equality.
上述整个欧洲范围内的思想家们必须保持自由和独立，而领袖们则需倾听他们的意见，���把他们的建议融入制定决策的过程。	Such think tanks at the European level must remain free and independent, but leaders must learn to pay attention to and integrate their recommendations into the policy-making process.
美国财政部再一次指责中国货币。 自2014年以来，人民币兑美元汇率贬值了2.4 % ， 而在此前的八年半中，人民币升值了37 % 。	The US Treasury was complaining yet again about the Chinese currency, which had depreciated by 2.4% against the dollar in the first half of 2014, after having appreciated by 37% over the previous eight and a half years.
经济衰退在2009年6月结束 — — 尽管经济调头上行势头如此明确，但政府却未能因这些成就而得到多少赞誉。	The recession ended in June 2009 – an achievement for which the administration did not get enough credit, despite the clarity of the turnaround.
全球援助总量大约在1300亿美元，这意味着13亿生活在极端贫困（每天花费少于1美元）的人口每人可以获得100美元现金。	With global aid totaling roughly $130 billon, each of the 1.3 billion people living in extreme poverty (less than $1 per day) worldwide would receive $100 in cash.
支持伦齐阵营要求选民批准的宪政改革将剪除一些其前任贝卢斯科尼的遗产 — — 这些遗产显著地表明了右翼民粹主义可能一个国家带来什么伤害。	The constitutional changes that Renzi’s Yes campaign is asking voters to approve would undo some of his predecessor Silvio Berlusconi’s legacy – a legacy that serves as a prime example of the damage right-wing populism can do to a country.
3月14日举行了20国财长会议，所有国家都以尽可能迅猛的速度尽全力与超强的努力对其经济体系进行了修整。	At the G-20 finance ministers meeting on March 14, all of our countries did their best and made massive efforts to repair their economic machinery as fast as possible.
关于新开发银行如何运行，还存在许多重大问题有待解决，但早期迹象表明基础设施将是该银行活动的核心领域，而非洲则是重点地区。	There are significant outstanding issues about how the New Development Bank will operate, but early indications suggest that infrastructure will be central to its activities, with an emphasis on Africa.
出身孤儿的傅立叶在修道士的教育下长大，18岁就当上教授，在回国开始科研生涯前曾担任拿破仑的埃及总督。	An orphan who was educated by monks, Fourier was a professor at the age of 18, and became Napoleon’s governor in Egypt before returning to a career in science.
增加教师培训和提高待遇以吸引人才加入和坚守教师岗位所需要投入的资源可以通过让不胜任者离开教师队伍来抵消。	The resources that are required for additional teacher training and for paying more to talented people to become and remain teachers can be offset by a willingness to shed those teachers who are not up to the task.
这一趋势的后果可能远远不止于个人或心理，而是造就 — — 用诺贝尔经济学奖获得者乔治·阿克洛夫（George Akerlof）和罗伯特·希勒（Robert Shiller）的话说 — — 轻易就上钩的愚民。	Such a trend could have consequences extending far beyond the personal or the emotional, creating a population that is, to borrow a phrase from the Nobel-laureate economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller, easily phished for phools.
但大量实证研究证实，在宏观层面，商业投资主要取决于预期未来需求和产出增长，而不是当前回报率或留存利润。	But extensive empirical research confirms that at the macro level, business investment depends primarily on expected future demand and output growth, not on current returns or retained earnings.
但即使创新不大大减速，或很快再次起势，抓住由此带来的生产率进步所需要的结构调整和行为变化也得消耗时间。	But even if innovation has not dropped off too much, or picks up again soon, the structural adaptation and behavioral changes needed to take advantage of the concomitant productivity gains will take time.
游说集团通俗英语运动（Campaign for Plain English）说英格兰银行的陈述是“毫无价值，让人不知所云的胡扯 ” 。	The Campaign for Plain English, a lobbying group, has described the Bank’s statements as “worthless, impenetrable waffle.”
比如，某人每年获得8,000美元转移支付（如食品券、住房补贴和工作所得税收优惠 ） ， 他有可能被认定为获得了相当于4美元时薪，这将被算入他的最低工资。	For example, someone who receives $8,000 a year in transfer payments (such as food stamps, housing assistance, and the Earned Income Tax Credit) might be deemed to have received the equivalent of $4 an hour toward meeting the minimum wage.
至于难民自身，除了那些在首都贝鲁特街头流浪的之外，大部分都被困在难民营或临时收容社区，缺乏足够的医疗卫生和教育机会。	As for the refugees themselves, many are visible in the streets of Beirut, the capital, but most are stuck in camps or temporary host communities, and lack adequate access to health care and schooling.
复仇的欲望望在他们心中代代相传，直到最终在某种程度上伸张正义。 他们用阻碍经济发展、妨碍社会资本形成和导致政治制度瘫痪的“冰冻冲突”来滋养心中的敌意。	They carry vengeance in their hearts from generation to generation, until a measure of justice is done, nursing their enmity in frozen conflicts that block economic growth, prevent the formation of social capital, and paralyze political institutions.
一些基础设施，比如医生执业法已经存在，但仍需采取更多的措施，比如加强对妇产科（大量基因工程干预发生在这里）的监管。	While some of the infrastructure, such as licensure laws for physicians, is already in place, additional steps may be needed, such as heightened regulation of infertility clinics, where many genetic-engineering interventions will take place.
以智利为例。 智利是拉丁美洲最富裕、也许也是最成功的国家之一，总是喜欢自比于澳大利亚、新西兰和加拿大等治理良好的资源富裕国。	Consider Chile, one of Latin America’s richest and arguably most successful countries, which likes to compare itself to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, well-run countries that are rich in natural resources.
没有任何伊斯兰政党在欧洲议会占据席位；举足轻重的穆斯林人物在欧洲主要文化和政治权力中心发挥作用的少之又少；几乎没有任何阿拉伯人和穆斯林进入到欧盟机构当中。	No Islamic parties hold seats in European parliaments; few leading Muslim figures feature in Europe’s major centers of cultural and political power; and European Union institutions are practically bereft of Arabs and Muslims.
与此同时，我们还有能力采取行动帮助灾区人民。 他们得到疏散，而且超过200个的医疗组织参与对居民进行放射性污染测试。	Meanwhile we were still able to take measures in helping people within the disaster zone; they were evacuated, and more than 200 medical organizations were involved in testing the population for radiation poisoning.
科罗廖夫大为不乐。 他的火箭并不是什么金属块，而且，在人造地球卫星成功之后，他不再认为格鲁什科可以和自己相提并论了。	Korolev was offended; his rocket wasn’t just a piece of metal, and, after his success with Sputnik, he no longer considered Glushko his equal.
许多国家都有影响力超群的强大精英，但在印度，世代相传的精英控制着公众生活方方面面的最顶层：政治、商业、媒体甚至宝莱坞莫不如此。	Many countries have powerful elites with outsize influence, but in India, dynastic elites control the top echelons in every sphere of public life: politics, business, the media, and even Bollywood.
美国与亲伊斯兰政治力量和政府的结盟的指导思想是伊斯兰教的外衣有助于保护可能被视为外国傀儡的领导人的信誉。	America’s dalliances with Islamist-leaning political forces – and governments – have been guided by the notion that the cloak of Islam helps to protect the credibility of leaders who might otherwise be seen as foreign puppets.
俄罗斯、中国和其他国家认为这一原则在利比亚滥用了，国家法的指导思想仍应是联合国宪章，而宪章禁止在除自卫或得到安理会授权之外的情形中使用武力。	Russia, China, and others believe that the principle was misused in Libya, and that the guiding doctrine of international law remains the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force except in self-defense, or when authorized by the Security Council.
因此，我不相信土耳其在欧盟委员会的敦促下所实施的改革会在加入欧盟后继续下去，也十分怀疑将来是否会出现倒退的局面。	So I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey implemented at the insistence of the European Commission would continue after accession. Indeed, I suspect that there will be backsliding.
尽管经济开放整体上有利于体征经济，但显然也需要确保收益更加平等地分配，或至少不会对某些群体造成无差别伤害。	While economic openness boosts economies as a whole, there is an obvious need to ensure that the benefits are more equitably distributed or, at least, that some groups are not inordinately hurt by it.
选择性保护、信用补贴、国有企业、本土生产规则以及技术转移要求都在中国成为制造业强国的过程中居功至伟。	Selective protection, credit subsidies, state-owned enterprises, domestic-content rules, and technology-transfer requirements have all played a role in making China the manufacturing powerhouse that it is.
此外，中国军事实力的扩张成为美国国家安全界跨党派的关注点，尽管其防务支出仍然只有美国的几分之一（这一点经常被忘得一干二净 ） 。	Moreover, China’s expanding military has become a source of bipartisan concern in US national-security circles, even though its defense spending is still but a fraction of America’s (a point often lost amid all the hand-wringing).
资产（住宅和股票）价格的一路扬升和利率的一路走低更增加了这种借贷方式的魅力，使得继任的金融市场改革者能够说服投资者风险已经在他们的掌控之中。	Such borrowing was especially attractive as asset (housing and equity) prices kept rising, interest rates remained low, and succeeding generations of financial market innovators could convince investors that they had mastered the exigencies of risk.
除了人员外，印尼的偏远卫生设施缺乏足够的配套基础设施：洁净水，卫生用品，可靠的电力以及基础医药和设备。	Beyond personnel, remote health facilities in Indonesia lack adequate supporting infrastructure: clean water, sanitation, reliable electricity, and basic medicine and equipment.
即便统治者会反对那些会损害其民粹主义议程的政策 — — 如高利率 — — 但也常常会屈服于金融市场的压力。	Even when rulers rant against policies that will hurt their populist agendas – like high interest rates – they typically succumb to pressure from financial markets.
如果虚假信息的解决之道在美国尚不明确，那么放在国际背景下就更加棘手，因为在多国背景下问题更加分散和不透明 — — 这也从另一个角度解释了为什么制定综合全面的解决方案是不可能的。	If the solutions to disinformation are unclear in the US, the situation is even thornier in the international context, where the problem is even more decentralized and opaque – another reason why no overarching, comprehensive solution is possible.
一个理直气壮的回答是集中在对付夺走最多人生命的疾病上 — — 比如疟疾、麻疹和痢疾，这些疾病在发展中国家夺走数百万人的生命，但在发达国家中几乎无人因此丧生。	There is a strong argument for tackling the diseases that kill the most people –diseases like malaria, measles, and diarrhea, which kill millions in developing countries, but very few in the developed world.
华盛顿 — — 伊朗总统马哈茂德·艾哈迈迪内贾德的首选继任者埃斯凡·拉希姆·马沙伊将不会参与6月14日的选举。	WASHINGTON, DC – Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s preferred successor, Esfandiar Rahim Mashai, will not be running in the June 14 election.
但是坚决与特朗普站在同一阵线的共和党似乎突然忘记了自己一贯以来对自由贸易的承诺，就跟几个月前它忘记了长期以来对财政审慎政策的承诺那样。	But, then again, the Republican Party, standing in solidarity with Trump, seems suddenly to have forgotten its longstanding commitment to free trade, much like a few months ago, when it forgot its longstanding commitment to fiscal prudence.
葛兰素史克曾表示Mosquirix的供应将“不以盈利为目的 ” ； 但制药公司仍然必须做到收支平衡。	GSK has said that Mosquirix will be offered “not for profit”; but the pharmaceutical company still must break even.
自然本身就能提供这样的方案，并充当更健康、更加生机盎然的社区的催化剂，推动投资，让城市全方位更加成功。	Nature itself can offer such solutions and be a catalyst for healthier, more vibrant neighborhoods, driving investment and making cities more successful by any measure.
事实上，2002—2014年间巴西GDP增长中只有10%可归因于全要素生产率改善，而三分之二是教育程度比以往略高的工人进入劳动力市场带来的结果。	Indeed, only 10% of Brazil’s GDP growth in 2002-2014 can be attributed to total factor productivity gains, while two-thirds was the result of an increase in slightly better-educated workers entering the labor force.
当地政府指责国家没有拨给足够的资源，而住院的精神病人却仍然只能透过被禁锢的窗户眼巴巴看着外面的世界。	The government placed the blame on local authorities; the local authorities blamed the government for allocating inadequate resources; and inmates of the institutions still look out at the world through windows that are locked and barred.
相对于物质需求，示威者们更加关注政治和经济方面的自由，反映出民众已经敏锐地意识到这些物质需要只不过是缺乏政治和经济自由所导致的症状和后果而已。	The protests are much more about political and economic freedom than about material needs, reflecting a keen awareness that such needs are merely a symptom and consequence of the absence of political and economic freedom.
过度的工资极快地摧毁劳动密集型上游产品阶段，还破坏像纺织品、简单服务业、旅游业和建筑业等其他劳动密集型部门。	Excessive wages destroy the labor-intensive upstream product stages too fast and also impairs other labor-intensive sectors like textiles, simple services, tourism, and construction.
在此我回想起了1978年时与波兰历史学家，政治家布罗尼斯拉夫·盖莱梅克（Bronisław Geremek）的一段对话 — — 当时我俩在华盛顿特区共享一间办公室。	Here I am reminded of a conversation with the Polish historian, statesman, and politician Bronisław Geremek in 1978, when we shared an office in Washington, DC.
普林斯顿—去年底去世的阿尔伯特·赫希曼（Albert Hirschman）是一位伟大的经济学家，他擅长通过专注于可观察行为的某一要素，以此作为转变我们对一系列具体问题的看法的方式，并获得了令人瞩目的成就。	PRINCETON – Albert Hirschman, who died at the end of last year, was a great economist with a gift for producing striking insights by focusing on an element of observable behavior as a way to transform our view of a whole range of particular problems.
不同于自由主义者和左翼人士，右翼及伊斯兰意识形态宣传的社会秩序和日常生活愿景专制、等级森严并往往遵循某种仪式。	Unlike liberals and the left, right-wing and Islamist ideologues promote an authoritarian, hierarchical, and often ritualized vision of social order and daily life.
2000年采取的联合举动是所谓的“里斯本战略 ” ， 其目标是将欧盟在2010年前变成“世界上最富活力和竞争力的知识经济体 ” 。	The collective response, adopted in 2000, has been the “Lisbon Strategy,” which aims at making the EU “the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world” by 2010.
在21世纪第一个十年中后段的基础设施繁荣中，公共资源被“租金制度 ” （ Rent Raj）所俘虏，在这一制度下，地租（土地和环境许可 ） 、 次级地租（煤炭）甚至空气租（频率）都能用来巧取豪夺。	During the infrastructure boom of the mid-to-late 2000s, public resources were captured under a “Rent Raj,” which put terrestrial rents (land and environmental permits), sub-terrestrial rents (coal), and even ethereal rents (spectrum) up for grabs.
但尽管这些国家还没有谁能真正取代美国的全球作用，美国也不能再像冷战后那样单方面行动，其实力也将受到大幅度削弱。	But, while none of these powers represents a serious alternative to America’s global role, the US will no longer be able to act unilaterally, as it did after the Cold War’s end, and it will be weakened substantially.
事实上，在去年11月美国总统特朗普的胜选之前的那几个月中，全球经济实际上进入了一个新的扩张时期 — — 尽管发达和新兴市场经济体的潜在增长仍然较低。	In fact, in the months before US President Donald Trump’s election last November, the global economy actually entered a new period of expansion – albeit one in which advanced and emerging-market economies’ potential growth remained low.
蔡美儿从不允许她的两个女儿索菲亚和路易斯看电视，打游戏，在同学家过夜或者参与学校活动，而是让她们每日苦练钢琴或小提琴。	Chua’s daughters, Sophia and Louise, were never allowed to watch television, play computer games, sleep over at a friend’s home, or be in a school play. They had to spend hours every day practicing the piano or violin.
而我们已经开始实施抗击危机计划并把焦点放在金融行业、实体经济、尤其是在那些和能源利用率有关的关键领域的重要基础建设投资上。	We have implemented an anti-crisis program that has concentrated on the financial sector, the real economy, and especially important infrastructure investments, particularly in the crucial area of energy efficiency.
当无法在科学上证明（或者否定）全球变暖导致了任何极端气候状况的时候，我们可以说全球变暖很可能增加了多种极端气候状况的发生概率和严重程度。	While it cannot be scientifically proven (or disproven, for that matter) that global warming caused any particular extreme event, we can say that global warming very likely makes many kinds of extreme weather both more frequent and more severe.
最后，欧洲应该让ESM变为欧洲货币基金，让它负责提供政策评估和建议以及金融援助 — — 可以通过欧盟委员会授权。	Finally, Europe should transform the ESM into a European Monetary Fund capable of providing policy assessment and advice, as well as financial assistance – possibly drawing on European Commission staff.
在土耳其，军队将自己描述为世俗土耳其共和国的卫士，但1923年成立的土耳其共和国的建立者阿塔图尔克本人便是一名军人。	In Turkey, the military proclaimed itself the guardian of the secular Republic of Turkey, founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, himself a military man.
1951年到1969年的君主制统治期间，伊德里斯国王的亲属及核心集团的铁蹄无情践踏了羽翼未丰的国家机构。	Under a monarchy that led the country from 1951-1969, King Idris’s relatives and inner circle ran roughshod over fledgling state institutions.
平心而论，美国因此所获得的13,000个新工作岗位，与印度和中国每年所必须增加的2,000万（甚至更多）的工作岗位比起来只是九牛一毛，对于美国所需要的每年两百万个岗位也只是杯水车薪。	Admittedly, the 13,000 new jobs in the United States is a drop in the bucket compared to the 20 million (or more) that India and China must create each year, or even compared to the two million that the US needs.
世界在扶贫和扩大饮用水普及面等方面取得了大量进展，但并没有在20世纪90年代趋势的基础上取得本可以实现的重大改善。	While the world made major gains in tackling hunger and expanding access to drinking water, it did not significantly improve upon what could have been expected relative to 1990s trends.
西姆斯解释说，与流行的信念相反，总需求和物价水平（通货膨胀）不是完全由 — — 甚至不是主要由 — — 货币政策决定。	As Sims explained, contrary to popular belief, aggregate demand and the price level (inflation) are not dictated only – or even primarily – by monetary policy.
而且，哈萨克斯坦尽管是一个穆斯林占多数的国家，但是它建立了一种世俗、多种族以及宗教多元的政治体制，而这种体制正是西方想要在整个穆斯林世界加以鼓励的。	Moreover, Kazakhstan, though a Muslim majority country, has established the type of secular, multi-ethnic, and multi religious polity that the West is seeking to encourage throughout the Muslim world.
第四，向偿债能力无忧的政府提供大规模流动性是避免利差急剧扩大、无法从市场上融资以至于流动性缺失问题恶化为偿付能力问题的必要手段。	Fourth, large-scale liquidity provision for solvent governments is necessary to avoid a spike in spreads and loss of market access that would turn illiquidity into insolvency.
全球人工智能竞赛不同于其他任何全球竞争，因为创新受国家、公司和学界推动的程度，在国与国之间大相径庭。	The global AI race is unlike any other global competition, because the extent to which innovation is being driven by the state, the corporate sector, or academia differs substantially from country to country.
为了缓解对主权财富的可能的政治考虑的担忧，国际货币基金组织（IMF）在2008年组织26家主权财富基金 — — 其中超过30%来自中东 — — 制定了圣地亚哥原则。	To allay concerns over SWFs’ potential political considerations, the International Monetary Fund convened 26 SWFs – over 30% of them from the Middle East – in 2008 to develop the Santiago Principles.
至于马来西亚，已经出现了与出口部门强迫劳工有关的问题 — — 在TPP协议签订前应该充分履行劳动标准。	As for Malaysia, important issues regarding forced labor in the export sector have emerged – and there should be full compliance with labor standards before the TPP deal is signed.
为了解风险究竟在哪里，就要去理解“弱人工智能 ” （ narrow AI）和“通用人工智能 ” （ Artificial General Intelligence）之间的区别。	To understand what is at stake, consider the distinction between “narrow AI” and “artificial general intelligence” (AGI).
但EEAS最终在与欧盟委员会的扯皮中无疾而终，而即将卸任的高级代表凯瑟琳·阿什顿（Catherine Ashton）也没能缓和这一紧张局面，因为她自己也不愿卷入欧盟内部的纠纷中。	But the EEAS ended up in a turf war with the European Commission, and outgoing High Representative Catherine Ashton did little to ease the tension, owing to her unwillingness to involve herself in intra-EU disagreements.
对这种态度的批评可以归结为一个简单的问题 ： “ 对我的社会福利，谁有比我更好的条件作出选择呢 ？ ”	The criticisms of this attitude boil down to a simple question: “Who is better equipped than I am to make choices about my welfare?”
以色列对某些阿拉伯政权而言或许已成为比以往任何时候都更重要的战略合作伙伴，或者成为事实上反对伊朗的盟国（比方说沙特阿拉伯 ） 。	Israel may have become, more than ever, a key strategic partner for some Arab regimes, or a de facto ally against Iran (as it is for Saudi Arabia).
全球投资者会继续把钱放在一个领导人以“火与怒”的威胁公然挑衅隐秘王国的国家，还是会转向别处寻找金融避难所？	Will global investors continue to put their money in a country whose leader loudly provokes the Hermit Kingdom with threats of “fire and fury,” or will they find financial refuge elsewhere?
不仅规模较小的亚洲发展中经济体是这样，如印度尼西亚、菲律宾和泰国等；域内规模较大较发达的经济体也是这样，如日本、韩国和台湾。	That is true not only of smaller Asian developing economies such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, but also of the larger and more developed economies in the region, such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.
比如说，西方这些年来对改革和民主的强调简直就是某种威胁，常用的典型口吻如下 ： “ 帮我们搞定伊拉克，否则我们就在你家里推广民主人权 ！ ”	For example, the Western emphasis on reform and democracy in recent years has been used more often than not as a threat, a typical message being: “Help us in Iraq or we will press for democracy and human rights in your own country.”
叙利亚国内及其周边国家遍布着众多派别，从决议实现停火和政治和解可能需要好几年 — — 就连这也有可能过于乐观。	Given the many divisions both within Syria and among its neighbors, getting from the resolution to a cease-fire and political settlement is likely to take years – and even that assessment may prove to be overly optimistic.
在1948年，天文学家佛瑞德·霍伊尔（Fred Hoyle）说 ， “ 一旦有了从外部给地球拍摄的照片 — — 一旦地球的绝对孤立变得众所周知 — — 和历史上那些有影响力的观点一样强大的新观点就会产生 。 ”	In 1948, the astronomer Fred Hoyle said, “Once a photograph of the Earth, taken from outside, is available – once the sheer isolation of the earth becomes plain – a new idea as powerful as any in history will be let loose.”
如果对美国财政政策的信心指数继续下滑导致美元疲软，欧洲和亚洲的出口会遭遇困境；如果赤字问题拖了美国经济的后腿，全球的经济增长有可能陷于停滞。	If declining confidence in US fiscal policy leads to a weaker dollar, Europe and Asia may find it more difficult to export, and if the deficits prove a drag on the American economy, global growth may stall.
我们走出这个监狱后的唯一希望是，有另一个国家决定为像我们这样的人 — — 我们这些没有做错任何事情，一开始就不应该被关押在这里的人 — — 提供安全的栖身之地。	Our only hope of getting out of this prison is that another country decides to provide safe haven to men like us – men who did nothing wrong and never should have been detained here in the first place.
当时我们就明白，如果掏空民主的价值，把民主降格成“保证”能解决所有问题的政党之间的竞争，这样的民主其实相当不民主。	"We were already certain then that if democracy is emptied of values and reduced to a competition of political parties that have ""guaranteed"" solutions to everything, it can be quite undemocratic."
牧民、小生产商和独立农民根本无法与低廉的零售价格竞争 — — 这样的价格无法覆盖该行业真正的环境和健康成本。	Pastoralists, small producers, and independent farmers simply cannot compete with low retail prices that fail to account for the industry’s true environmental and health costs.
他们还相信 — — 或至少幻想过 — — 各种形式的社会主义和国家社会主义，民主和民权在他们看来并非首要问题。	They also believed in – or at least toyed with – forms of socialism and étatism, and did not consider democracy or civil rights to be priorities.
通过将公司税率降低到具备全球竞争力的水平并给予更好的利润归国条件，该税收计划有望将企业收益转移回美国。	By lowering the corporate-tax rate to a globally competitive level and granting better terms for repatriating profits, the tax package is expected to shift corporate earnings back to the United States.
但存款保险的存在创造了滥用的空间，即过度冒险，因为银行高管在一切顺利时大捞好处，而潜在风险都加在了保险基金头上。	But the existence of deposit insurance creates room for abuse, in the form of excessive risk taking, because bank executives get the upside if things goes well, and any potential losses are imposed on the insurance fund.
但这“成功”不仅仅牵涉到以色列的撤离，还需要巴勒斯坦证明他们能够进行有效管理，并能结束起源于巴勒斯坦的恐怖主义暴力活动。	But “success” entails more than departing Israelis. It also requires that Palestinians demonstrate that they can govern responsibly and that they can put an end to terrorist violence emanating from Palestinian soil.
最后，在达沃斯还进行了推动朝鲜半岛、委内瑞拉以及撒哈拉以南非洲和索马里地区的持续多边维和和政治妥协的外交对话。	Last but not least, Davos hosted diplomatic talks to bolster ongoing multilateral peacemaking and political-reconciliation efforts on the Korean Peninsula, in Venezuela, and in Sub-Saharan Africa and Somalia.
随后，11月7日，可口可乐也就乐施会的号召做出了回应，它将对供应商和灌装商的土地掠夺行为“零容忍 ” 。	Then, on November 7, Coca-Cola responded to the Oxfam campaign by declaring that it would have “zero tolerance” for land grabbing by its suppliers and bottlers.
这并不值得庆祝，相反，它反映了欧洲政治家们在应对欧元区危机（以及监管市场）时缺乏战略眼光和勇气的事实。	That is no cause for celebration. On the contrary, it reflects European politicians’ lack of sufficient strategic vision and courage in dealing with the eurozone crisis – and also in regulating the markets.
恢复奥斯陆和平进程的努力 — — “路线图”和安纳波利斯计划 — — 同样也未能突破空洞的宣言和毫无意义的拍照机会。	Attempts to revive the Oslo peace process – the “Road Map” and the Annapolis process – have similarly failed to achieve more than vacuous declarations and hollow photo opportunities.
比如，华坚鞋业、C&H服饰和JD集团（一家成衣制造商）目前分别在埃塞俄比亚、卢旺达和坦桑尼亚的特别经济区设厂经营。	For example, the Huajian Shoemaking Company, C&H Garments, and China JD Group (an apparel maker), are now operating in special economic zones in, respectively, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania.
虽然在去年的大选中税制改革在总统Felipe Calderón的议事日程上处于重要地位，但选举改革却不是。	While tax reform was high on President Felipe Calderón’s agenda during last year’s presidential campaign, electoral reform was not.
在许多俄罗斯的贵族群体中，贪污腐败屡见不鲜。 这中行为和许多在非洲具有同样地位人的灾难性习惯非常相似。	The corrupt enrichment of so many Russian elites mimics the disastrous habits of many of their African counterparts.
为了增加实现发展目标的机会，海地必须贯彻其去年举行早该举行的立法和地方选举的计划，并在明年举行总统选举。	In order to improve its chances of achieving its development goals, Haiti must follow through on its plans to hold long-overdue legislative and local elections later this year, followed by a presidential election next year.
它们必须靠价值观和理想的力量去赢得人们的忠诚¾不仅通过孤立恐怖和极端份子，而且通过采用有意义的方式协助贫困国家实现繁荣。	And they must win people’s allegiance by the power of their values and their ideals – not only by isolating terrorists and extremists, but also by helping, in meaningful ways, poor countries to prosper.
新兴市场经济体担任该组织的主席国，韩国不是第一个，但它是全球金融危机之后的第一个；而且也是自 G-20 成为世界经济的指导性协商机制以来，第一个担任其主席国的新兴市场经济体。	Korea is not the first emerging market to chair the G-20, but it is the first to do so since the global financial crisis. And it is the first to do so since the G-20 emerged as the steering committee for the world economy.
虽然大概有部分是出自于实现社会正义的动机，但实际上贝隆是在贿赂那些受益者来为自身权力财富的崛起铺路。	Although his motivation, at least in part, may have been a desire for social justice, Perón was, in effect, bribing the beneficiaries to support his own rise to power and wealth.
我们在一份研究这一市场反应的新文章中，根据美国资本要求规则算出所有51家参与测试的银行的总资本短缺为1,230亿欧元。	In a new paper investigating this market reaction, using United States capital-requirement rules, we calculate the total capital shortfall in all 51 participating banks to be €123 billion.
因此伊朗市民 — — 以及所有渴望反抗一个残暴政府或者抗议一个民主政权的 — — 都要牢记这些历史经验。	Iran’s citizens – and all people longing to resist a tyrannical government or to protest in an established democracy – should bear that lesson in mind.
这进一步证实了接触前预防（PrEP）技术的有效性，该技术旨在让艾滋病毒测试阴性者利用抗逆转录病毒药物保护自己远离感染威胁。	This is further evidence of the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a technique by which people who are HIV-negative use antiretroviral drugs to protect themselves from infection.
零利率和负利率不但助长了资产市场的短期投机，伤害了长期投资；还破坏了银行、保险公司和基金管理公司的业务模式。	Zero and negative interest rates have not only encouraged short-term speculation in asset markets and harmed long-term investments; they have also destroyed the business model of banks, insurance companies, and fund managers.
发自加州拉古娜海滩 — — 当今西方政府面临的其中一个最艰巨的挑战，就是如何去启动和引导那些转型性的 — — 以及对个人及企业来说，自我赋权（self-empowering）的 — — 科技革新力量。	LAGUNA BEACH – One of the most difficult challenges facing Western governments today is to enable and channel the transformative – and, for individuals and companies, self-empowering – forces of technological innovation.
因此，正如在文化领域的其它方面实行的策略那样，中国政府在很大程度上放弃了对电视内容在道德方面的控制。	Thus, in a strategy mirrored elsewhere in the cultural sphere, the government simply relinquished much control over the moral component of TV content.
随后的几届美国政府都坚持这一方针，而民调显示这在日本人中间也有很高的接受度 — — 不仅是因为2011年东北地震和海啸后的紧密救灾合作。	Subsequent US administrations have upheld this approach, and opinion polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan – not least owing to close cooperation on disaster relief following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011.
说到底，中国经济的复杂性和特殊性意味着评估当前状况和表现需要以细节为导向的分析，尽可能多地考虑抵消性因素。	The bottom line is that the complexity and distinctiveness of China’s economy mean that assessing its current state and performance requires a detail-oriented analysis that accounts for as many offsetting factors as possible.
如果缺少冷静、建设性、有时候不那么令人愉快的对话来讨论我们想要怎样的未来，那么偏隘和孤立主义有可能毁掉数百年来所取得的进步。	In the absence of calm, constructive, and sometimes uncomfortable conversations about what kind of future we want, intolerance and isolationism threaten to roll back centuries of progress.
这世界上的任何事都得来不易：如果欧盟不能管理一个多文化的欧洲社会，那么它就应该准备好应对永久的停滞。	Nothing comes easy in this world: if the Union cannot manage a multicultural society in Europe, then it ought to prepare itself for permanent stagnation.
要实现这一点，伊朗需要将其总产出（包括国内消费）提高到每天六百万桶，大致相当于20世纪70年代的巅峰产量。	To do this, Iran would have to boost its total output (including domestic consumption) to six million barrels per day, roughly equal to its peak production in the 1970s.
在奥巴马医保前，美国实施的体系达不到这一标准，无保险覆盖者不但给自己造成了成本，也给其他美国人造成了成本。	The system the US had before Obamacare did not meet that standard, as the uninsured imposed costs not just on themselves, but also on other Americans.
与此同时，许多民主党因为重新沦为少数派而舒了一口气，因为这使他们不再有压力必须取得成果获听命于党领导人。	Meanwhile, many Democrats view their new minority status as a source of relief, as it has removed the pressure to deliver results or obey their party's leaders.
它无法产生这样的信念：凭借错误的证据自信满满地以萨达姆·侯赛因拥有大规模杀伤性武器为借口之人的政治继任者迫不及待地跳入另一个血腥漩涡。	It defies belief that the political successors of those who confidently launched the invasion of Iraq on the false evidence that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction should be so eager to be sucked into another bloody maelstrom.
利润率低、负债少的银行属于光脚的不怕穿鞋的那一类，它们会倾向于赌博 — — 在存款保险和“太大而不能倒”的政策下，这一倾向愈加明显。	A bank with thin margins and limited liability does not have much to lose, and will tend to gamble – a tendency that is exacerbated by deposit insurance and too-big-to-fail policies.
从那一天起，美国不再是领导世界的超级大国 — — 那个有缺陷但最终心怀善意的和平，繁荣以及世界各地人权的保障者。	On that day, the United States ceased to be the world’s leading superpower – the flawed but ultimately well-meaning guarantor of peace, prosperity, and human rights around the world.
深思熟虑的计划、公共和私人机构间的生产合作、着力的执行，通过这些措施，印度政府才能为技术进步铺平道路。	With thoughtful planning, productive collaboration between public and private institutions, and capable execution, India’s government can clear the way for technological progress.
纵使中国在开发阿富汗自然资源方面的投资已达数十亿美元之巨，却依然难以观察到一个涵盖范围更广且更为主动的参与性政策。	But, despite the billions of dollars China has invested in developing Afghanistan’s natural resources, it is hard to see it undertaking a policy of broader and proactive engagement there.
迟早人们会发现，最大的风险在于未能及时采取行动导致无法挽回欧元的局部分裂：马上采取行动要比等待半年再动手有效得多。	The risk is that, by then, it could be too late to save the euro from a partial break-up: what might work if adopted promptly could be ineffective if adopted in six months.
实力强大和集中领导的工会组织造成工资差异的缩减和对公司利润的挤压。 在这一期间，工作、储蓄以及开创企业的经济激励遭到了削减。	Economic incentives to work, save, and start businesses were also reduced through the compression of wage differentials and a big squeeze on company profits, both largely the result of strong and centralized labor unions.
20世纪70年代曾完全依赖于能源进口的丹麦现在成了欧盟唯一一个能源净出口国，风力发电满足了该国100%的电力需求。	Denmark, a country that in the 1970s was almost entirely dependent on energy imports, is now the European Union’s only net energy exporter, often generating more than 100% of its electricity needs from wind power.
军政府首脑Than Shwe将军“颜面尽失”并立刻消失在公众视线当中，以至于有的缅甸人认为他已经死了。	Junta leader Senior General Than Shwe “lost face” and promptly disappeared from public view so completely that some Burmese thought he had died.
薄熙来在许多方面都符合中国人对“政治精英”的定义 — — 受过良好教育，聪明睿智，行事老练，而且富有个人魅力（主要在西方政商界人士看来 ） 。	In many ways, Bo personified the Chinese concept of “meritocracy” – well-educated, intelligent, sophisticated, and charming (mainly to Western executives).
数据挖掘导致错误结论的情况不胜枚举 — — 包括用药剂量和法律案例 — — 原因是没有咨询相关领域的专家，导致关键信息被排除在分析之外。	There are many examples of cases in which data mining has led to the wrong conclusion – including in medical diagnoses or legal cases – because experts in the field were not consulted and critical information was left out of the analysis.
祖马似乎试图按照经济自由战士领导者兼委内瑞拉查韦斯方案崇拜者尤利乌斯·马勒马所指明的方向进行激进的资产再分配改造。	What Zuma seems to seek is radical asset redistribution in the direction suggested by Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters and an admirer of Venezuela’s chavista approach.
任命温和派将军拉希尔·沙里夫（Raheel Sharif）为陆军参谋长有助于缓和局面；但在巴基斯坦和印度分别支持阿富汗对立双方的情况下，如果紧张局面升级，军方和ISI会再次强硬起来。	The appointment of the pliable general Raheel Sharif as army chief has helped defuse the situation; but, with Pakistan and India backing opposing sides in Afghanistan, the military and the ISI could reassert themselves should tensions there rise.
这一经历促使他成立了丹格特学院（Dangote Academy ） ， 专门从事旨在填补尼日利亚国内外行业技能空白的人才开发。	This experience motivated him to establish his Dangote Academy, a center for talent development that aims to help fill the industrial-skills gap in Nigeria and beyond.
希腊和其他欧元区国家已经知道，匆忙进行财政调整会增加债务负担，因为流动性挤压和伴生不确定性会拖累产出和改革措施。	As Greece and other eurozone countries have already learned, attempting to rush fiscal adjustment increases the debt burden, as the liquidity squeeze and concomitant uncertainty undermine output and reform efforts.
当哈耶克指出中央计划臃肿低效，并以此为市场辩护的理论日渐流行之时，凯恩斯认为市场需要持续干预以保持稳定的观点则得到了各国财政部和中央银行的认同。	While Hayek’s defense of the market system against the gross inefficiency of central planning won increasing assent, Keynes’s view that market systems require continuous stabilization lingered on in finance ministries and central banks.
他似乎认为，尽管更加一体化的欧元区毫无疑问令人渴望，但如果无法相信其中一个国家会遵守其政府所同意的条件，欧元区就无从实现进一步一体化。	He seems to believe that a more integrated eurozone, though certainly desirable, is not feasible with a country that cannot be trusted to abide by the terms to which its government has agreed.
除非民主党不间断地进行冗长演讲，否则共和党将填补最高法院的出缺，而他们曾经阻止了民主党总统奥巴马填补空缺。	Anything less than constant Democratic filibusters will allow Republicans to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court that they have blocked Democratic President Barack Obama from filling.
未来运动员将进行基因改造的前景引发了体育界的恐慌，随之而来的是把这些运动员视作非人类或某种形式的突变异种。	The prospect of a future of genetically modified athletes incites alarm throughout the sports world, accompanied by portrayals of such athletes as inhuman or some form of mutant.
但有一种因素可能将所有因素联系在一起：巴切莱特有权而且可能在 2013 － 2014 年再次竞选总统。	One factor, however, may hold everything together: Bachelet can and may run again for president in 2013-2014.
从这个意义上讲，即将投入运营的伊朗阿拉克核电厂（允许伊朗在国内生产钚元素并实现其武器化）或许是临时协议最令人不安的项目。	In this sense, perhaps the most troubling aspect of the interim deal concerns Iran’s yet-to-be-opened Arak plant, which would offer a path to domestic plutonium production and weaponization.
但是，如欧洲社会和环境责任科学家网络（European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility，ENSSER）主席安吉里卡·希尔贝克（Angelika Hilbeck）所言，更好的问题是 ： “ 它还能做什么 ？ ”	But, as Angelika Hilbeck, President of the European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility (ENSSER) argues, a better question would be: “What else does it do?”
自由市场理念演化自盎格鲁-撒克逊理论家（其中许多来自苏格兰 ） ， 他们不断移居和殖民新的地域，让那些拥有财富的个人觉得消费是会无限增长的。	Free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists (many from Scotland), who migrated and colonized territories, allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption.
非洲所需的食品、饮料和类似加工产品约1/3仍依靠进口，而东南亚国家协会的进口比重仅为约20 % ， 南美南方共同市场集团进口比重仅为约10 % 。	Africa still imports about one-third of the food, beverages, and similar processed goods it consumes, whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations imports about 20%, and South America’s Mercosur trade bloc imports just 10%.
20世纪，美国取而代之，建立美国统治下的和平（Pax Americana ） ， 向西欧、亚洲、中东和拉美的广大地域提供安全保障。	In the twentieth century, the United States took over that role, imposing its Pax Americana to provide security to most of Western Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.
如果一国正好是产生问题的商品的生产国，那么它也许会采取出口管制来保护本国消费者免受世界价格上涨影响。	If the country is a producer of the commodity in question, it may use export controls to insulate domestic consumers from increases in the world price.
瑞典将特别关注能效计划，因为类似计划不仅能改善能源安全，降低成本，而且能为应对气候变化做出重要贡献。	Here, Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programs, which will serve not only the purposes of enhancing energy security and reducing costs, but will also be an important contribution to the fight against climate change.
对沙特瓦哈比主义（皇室家族根据宗教训令被授予绝对权力）来说，将合法性建立在真正的代表制之上的政治伊斯兰教的创新形式是一个战略威胁。	For Saudi Wahhabism, in which absolute power is granted to the royal family by religious mandate, innovative forms of political Islam that anchor legitimacy in genuine representation are a strategic threat.
根据2010年的一份研究，抗虫转基因玉米田会产生对害虫的“区域抑制效应 ” ， 相邻的种植传统作物的田地也能受益。	According to a 2010 study, fields of insect-resistant GM corn have an “area-wide suppression effect” on insects, benefiting neighboring fields containing conventional corn varieties.
佛山市政府在20世纪80年代初便是第一批试点乡镇企业和民营经济的地方政府之一，在培养民营企业方面起到了重要的领头作用。	Foshan’s municipal government, which was among the first to experiment with township and village enterprises and privatization in the early 1980s, has played an important role in buoying private enterprise.
酒类管理方面的经验表明这些手段将虽然能在一定程度上减少吸食所带来的坏处，且无法完全消灭它，尤其是当大麻销售者被允许推广自己的商品的时候。	Experience with alcohol suggests that these approaches may modestly reduce, but not eliminate, the harms associated with use, especially if sellers are allowed to promote their wares.
另有一次，囚室没有通风，室温高达100华氏度，被囚者躺在地上几乎失去知觉，旁边还有一堆头发 — “ 很明显，他整夜都在抓扯着自己的头发 。 ”	On another occasion the room was unventilated, the temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the detainee was almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next to him – “he had apparently been pulling it out throughout the night.”
这些金融产品的市场在过去30年里已经发展到了一种为短期获利提供巨大机会的程度。 这就为市场参与者提供了强大的投机动力。	The market for these financial products grew over 30 years to the point that they delivered huge opportunities for immediate gain, which provided a strong incentive for market participants to play with them more and more.
无论俄罗斯人认为国家经济多么萎靡不振 — — 今年国内生产总值预计萎缩3.8 % ， 而通胀则可能突破15 % — —都有人向他们保证没有普京更加不堪设想。	Whatever Russians think of the country’s economic malaise – GDP is expected to contract by 3.8% this year, while inflation could top 15% – they are assured that they would be much worse off without Putin.
在强有力的政策缺位的情况下，人们很���易想到恐怖情形：一蹶不振的产出和金融体系中的问题相互交织，使得产出进一步大幅下降。	In the absence of strong policies, it is too easy to think of scary scenarios in which depressed output and troubles in the financial system feed on each other, leading to further large drops in output.
关键是中、法、俄、英、美等安理会五大常任理事国拥有一票否决权，因此只要五巨头中有一个不赞成即使其他国家多数赞成也没有用。	Crucially, the Security Council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the US – have veto power, so a majority means nothing if a single member of the P-5 dissents.
毕竟，亚洲地区没有哪个国家 — — 不管是日本、韩国、中国台湾、菲律宾这样的民主政体，还是中国和越南这样的一党执政国家，抑或文莱这样的微型君主国家 — — 可以在默许这类问题的情况下生存下去。	After all, no government in the region – whether a democracy like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines, a one-party state like China and Vietnam, or a tiny monarchy like Brunei – can acquiesce on such issues and hope to survive.
不过，目前还不清楚中国将以何种方式着陆 — — 这不仅是因为官方统计数据可能极大夸大了当前的GDP增长。	Still, it is unclear what kind of landing China faces – not least because official statistics may be overstating current GDP growth considerably.
叙利亚也是如此，尽管叙利亚局势的螺旋毫无疑问是一个下降螺旋，任何反抗都遭到了镇压，特别是在日内瓦第二轮和平谈判失败后。	The same could be said of Syria, though the spiral there has been an unremittingly downward one, and any reversal remains blocked, particularly since the failure of the second round of peace negotiations in Geneva.
在这样的基础上，如果某一言论构成明确而现实的威胁，并在此基础上满足启动限制规定需要满足的条件，那么上述言论必须造成直接的损害，以至于充分探讨言论内容的任何可能性都被预先排除。	On that basis, for speech to pose a clear and present danger that could justify prohibiting it, the harm the speech would cause must be so imminent that it could preclude any opportunity to discuss fully what had been said.
如果出现了这种情况，就会产生蕴含着分离主义的爆炸性局面，这不是古已有之的团体对立，而是新移民与当地人之间的对立。	Where this happens, an explosive condition can arise, a kind of separatism within, not by historically separate groups but by newcomers against natives.
俄罗斯官员暗示，美国再利用朝鲜或伊朗对美国采取核弹道导弹打击的威胁作为建设针对俄罗斯（可能还有中国）的防御系统的借口。	Russian officials intimate that the US is using the threat of a North Korean or Iranian attack on the US with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles as a pretext to erect defenses against Russia (and probably China).
正如巴勒斯坦解放组织在黎巴嫩一直存在到1982年，使其中寄居国不幸地陷入了内战，并导致强权国家入侵，最终引发更多的极端主义运动 — — 红色高棉, 黎巴嫩真主党以及伊斯兰圣战组织。	Like the PLO presence in Lebanon until 1982, this strategy plunged hapless host countries into civil war and provoked invasions by stronger powers, in turn spurring more extremist movements – the Khmer Rouge, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad.
而据理查德·图尔为共识研究中心所做的研究，到2100年，全球最有效的碳减排计划 — — 旨在温度上升幅度控制在2摄氏度之内 — — 将每年耗费40万亿美元。	The most efficient, global carbon cuts – designed to keep temperature increases under two degrees Celsius – would cost $40 trillion a year by 2100, according to research by Richard Tol for the Copenhagen Consensus Center.
经济学家相信许多在医疗卫生质量方面的提升 — — 例如对白内障和心脏疾病的更有效治疗 — — 有在实际GDP方面得到准确的体现，甚至因为价格提升而受到错误报道。	Economists believe that many improvements in health-care quality – such as more effective treatments for cataracts or cardiac disease – are not accurately reflected in real GDP, and are incorrectly reported as price increases.
胡锦涛还在奥巴马的两天北京访问行程中两次亲自与其共同进餐 — — 主席的这个姿态也堪称破天荒第一次，其他如何国家元首都没享受过，包括奥巴马的前任小布什。	And Hu himself dined with Obama twice during his two-day stay in Beijing – a gesture never made to any visiting foreign leader, including Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush.
而无限期QE实施过程中，通过抬升通胀预期压低实际利率的做法也有风险，最终会把高通胀预期的火焰煽起来。	And the reduction in real interest rates via a rise in expected inflation when open-ended QE is implemented risks eventually stoking inflation expectations.
俄央行对俄罗斯的麻烦没有责任 — — 比如卢布挤兑、衰退和狂飙突进的通胀 — — 对于使用利率工具防止资本外流总是失败也没有责任，这些都不重要。	Never mind that the central bank is not responsible for Russia’s troubles – the run on the ruble, the recession, and the flare-up of inflation – and that using interest rates to prevent capital outflows always fails.
一股革命性的 — — 并且相当不“英国”的 — — 潮流已经形成，而英国首相梅本月在保守党会议上的《英国本土论 》 （ Little Englander）演讲表明，英国正在迈向“硬退欧 ” 。	An almost revolutionary – and very un-British – dynamic has taken hold, and, as British Prime Minister Theresa May indicated in her “Little Englander” speech at the Conservative Party conference this month, the UK is heading for a “hard Brexit.”
伦敦—11月，英国金融市场行为监管局（Financial Conduct Authority，FCA）宣布与六家银行和解。 这六家银行被FCA指控操纵外汇市场，将支付总共43亿美元的和解金。	LONDON – In November, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced a settlement in which six banks would be fined a total of $4.3 billion for manipulating the foreign-exchange market.
2004年，科菲·安南（Kofi Annan）说 ， “ 在管理、促进和保护[互联网]在我们的生活中的存在时，我们需要的创造力不比发明互联网更少 。 ”	As Kofi Annan said back in 2004, “In managing, promoting, and protecting [the Internet’s] presence in our lives, we need to be no less creative than those who invented it.”
经过短途旅行，克林顿从达卡抵达印度的西孟加拉邦，接待她的是身材矮小的首席部长马马塔·班纳吉，她的当选结束了该邦34年的共产党统治。	From Dhaka, Clinton made the short journey to India’s West Bengal, where her host was the diminutive Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, whose election ended 34 years of Communist rule in the state.
气候变化曾被描绘成一场损失高达全球GDP20%的巨型灾难，虽然勇气可嘉的政要们称能用1%的GDP解决这一问题。	Climate change has been portrayed as a huge catastrophe costing as much as 20% of world GDP, though brave politicians could counter it at a cost of just 1% of GDP.
而我之所以决定前往这个国家，是因为聆听了不丹总理吉格梅·廷里在2010年德里峰会上那场激动人心的可持续发展演说。	I came to Bhutan after hearing an inspiring speech by Prime Minister Jigme Thinley at the 2010 Delhi Summit on Sustainable Development. Thinley had made two compelling points.
我所在的公司德国普华永道为第一次到达的难民提供为期十周（对他们来说这是最关键的一段时期）的免费语言和职业培训。	My own firm, PwC Germany, offers a free ten-week language and vocational training course for refugees when they first arrive – the most critical period for them.
总而言之，这三大发展趋势有助于解释新选民阶层的兴起：高技能、高薪酬，没有受过作为自由民主基础的价值观的教育。	Taken together, these three developments help to explain the rise of a new class of voters: highly skilled, highly paid, and poorly educated in the values underpinning liberal democracy.
布朗一直渴望成为首相，这可以追溯到1994年5月12日，在这个决定命运的日子里，工党在野领袖约翰·史密斯因心脏病发作猝死。	Brown has longed to be prime minister ever since May 12, 1994, the fateful day when John Smith, the Labour Party’s leader in opposition, dropped dead of a heart attack.
俄罗斯支持伊朗和叙利亚的什叶派政府，以确保其自身在中东的立场 — — 反对美国支持的沙特和海湾国家的逊尼派执政者（他们对以色列的威胁更小 ） 。	Russia supports the Shia governments of Iran and Syria in order to secure its own position in the Middle East against US-backed Sunni rulers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, who are less of a threat to Israel.
随后，希腊、爱尔兰和葡萄牙丧失了融资能力，向国际货币基金组织（IMF）和欧盟寻求“保释 ” （ bailout ） 。	And then Greece, Ireland, and Portugal lost access to credit markets, requiring bailout packages from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.
纽约—巴勒斯坦不再是一个“实体 ” ， 而是一个国家 — — 确切地说，是联合国非成员观察员国，和梵蒂冈一样。	NEW YORK – Palestine is no longer an “entity,” but a state – or, to be precise, a non-member observer state of the United Nations, just like the Holy See.
热浪来袭期间，印度城市温度即使在夜间也有可能达到极值，从而导致睡眠对那些没有正规住所或现代制冷方式的人而言演变成一种痛苦。	During heat waves, urban temperatures in India can be extreme even at night, making sleeping agonizing for those without proper shelter or modern cooling methods.
这一概念也是对预期中的挫折的强权政治式的承认（用当时国防部长拉姆斯菲尔德的话说，就是“决胜 ” ） 。	It was also a realpolitik acknowledgement of the setbacks to be expected along the way (the “slog,” as then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put it).
现在，随着制药公司越来越频繁地试图针对特定种族群体研发药物，一直为人们所避讳的种族遗传学问题再度被人们提起。	Now, with drug companies increasingly seeking to develop medications that target particular racial groups, the long-taboo subject of racial genetics has reemerged.
现在整顿时机不对，因为各国政府刚刚在去年九月举行的联合国千年首脑会议上承诺实现减少贫困和降低新生儿死亡率等发展目标。	This comes at a bad time, just after world governments committed themselves to achieving the development goals, such as reducing poverty and infant mortality, agreed last September at the United Nations’ Millennium Summit.
公司表现也有所改善 — — 特别是受益于日元贬值的出口部门 — — 许多公司都报告了创纪录的盈利水平。	And corporate performance has improved – primarily in the export industries, which have benefited from a depreciated yen – with many companies posting their highest profits on record.
方济各的“兔子”说被媒体广泛报道，但很少有媒体报道，他还说，外部机构不应该将其关于家庭规模控制的观点施加给发展中世界。	"Francis's “rabbit"" comment was widely covered in the media, but fewer reported that he had also said that no outside institution should impose its views about regulating family size on the developing world."
如果危机发生在具系统重要性的经济中 — — 如美国或欧洲（新兴经济体最大的两个出口市场 ） — —其结果将是全球总需求不足。	If the crisis occurs in a systemically important economy – such as the US or Europe (emerging economies' two largest external markets) – the result is a global shortage of aggregate demand.
他提出了一个全面提升教育，基础设施和科学技术的宏伟计划，并雄心勃勃地将恢复美国经济增长的志向与当年执行登月计划的决心相提并论。	He outlined a bold plan for improving education, infrastructure, and technology, and vividly compared the resolve required to put a man on the moon to the determination needed to restore growth to the US economy.
33年前，在哈维尔的努力下，出台了代表所有持不同政见者及铁幕笼罩下其他民众理想的标志性文件《77宪章 》 。	Thirty-three years ago, Havel helped initiate Charter 77, the landmark document that crystallized the ideals of all the dissidents – and many others – trapped behind the Iron Curtain.
美国当然希望巴基斯坦能消灭阿富汗和巴基斯坦的塔利班领袖，但绝不会过多依靠巴基斯坦统治者来实现这一目标。	The US would certainly like Pakistan to eliminate the leadership of the Taliban, both Afghan and Pakistani, but will not lean too heavily on Pakistan’s rulers to accomplish this goal.
而如果说到奥朗德的全面远景规划，粗看之下会令人想起1960年代法国成功的社会民主制度：一个强大的福利国家，拥有充足的公共投资去复苏增长并推动就业。	In Hollande’s case, the rare glimpses of a comprehensive vision recall France’s successful social democracy of the 1960’s: a strong welfare state, together with abundant public investment to revive economic growth and boost employment.
面对当下的经济危机，采取“混”下去的方式将使危机继续，经济长期停滞不前。 这正是凯恩斯同时代的经济学家埃尔文·汉森所描述的情况。	In today’s crisis, muddling through would be a recipe for a continuation of the crisis and secular stagnation of the type once described by Alvin Hansen, a contemporary of Keynes.
伦敦—2016年，英国做出了一个至关重要的决定 — — 脱离欧盟。 唐纳德·特朗普当选为美国总统，许多欧洲国家继续与内部挑战搏斗。	LONDON – In 2016, the United Kingdom made the momentous decision to leave the European Union, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, and many European countries continued to struggle with internal challenges.
由此可见，一个真正全球集思广益的办法就是首先讨论可资利用的最佳技术和经济选项，以及如何通过有针对性的研发和更好的经济激励措施来改进这些选项。	A true global brainstorming approach would first discuss the best technological and economic options available, and how to improve these options through targeted research and development and better economic incentives.
如果当前趋势继续，到2030年 — — 即实现17个联合国可持续发展目标的时限 — — 英联邦国家70%以上的儿童的阅读和数学水平将存在缺失。	If current trends continue, by the year 2030 – the deadline for meeting the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals – more than 70% of children in Commonwealth countries will be failing reading and math.
Sheikh Hasina — — 孟加拉国人民联盟领导人兼孟加拉国建国之父的女儿，在去年一场导致约20人死亡、百来人受伤的手榴弹袭击中死里逃生，凶手却至今未被缉获。	Sheikh Hasina, the Awami League’s leader and the daughter of the Bangladesh’s founding father, survived a grenade attack last summer that killed at least 20 people and injured hundreds more. The killers have never been apprehended.
尽管很多人表示希望日本改善自卫能力，但占压倒多数的受调查者否决了发展核武器的想法，而是支持继续依赖《美日安保条约 》 。	While a significant number expressed a desire for Japan to improve its ability to defend itself, an overwhelming majority rejected the idea of developing nuclear arms and supported continued reliance on the US-Japan Security Treaty.
但如今，非国大党被指执政无能、道德败坏，在2016年的地方选举中，反对党民主联盟（Democratic Alliance）在城市地区赢得前所未有的大胜。	Yet today the ANC stands accused of both fecklessness and moral decay, and it suffered unprecedented losses to the opposition Democratic Alliance in urban areas in local elections in 2016.
这个问题值得考虑。 他是奥维尔的老师，写过另外一部伟大的预言性政治小说 ― ― 《美丽新世界 》 。	It is worth considering whether Aldous Huxley, who taught Orwell at school and who wrote another great and portentous piece of political fiction, Brave New World, provides a more relevant perspective.
此外，在北半球注入硫酸盐可能导致非洲萨赫勒地区严重干旱（因为降水急剧减少 ） ， 而一些非洲国家将经历更多降水。	Moreover, sulphate injections in the northern hemisphere could cause serious drought in the Africa’s Sahel region, owing to dramatic reductions in precipitation, while some African countries would experience more precipitation.
如今，这仍是一个紧迫问题，因为美联储正在减少资产买入规模，造成了资本流逆转，许多EMDC大有高处不胜寒之感。	And it is still a pressing question today, now that the Fed is winding down its asset purchases, causing capital flows to reverse and leaving many EMDCs high and dry.
这种政权制度可能会认为它能够把这一程序为己所用，然而一旦人民感到被赋予了权利，局面就未必那样容易控制。	The regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to its own advantage, but events may not be that easy to control once people begin to feel empowered.
但IT的成长也导致了垄断力和进入壁垒，从而带来了巨大的经济、社会和政治消极副作用，包括“假新闻”的泛滥。	But, by enabling the rise of monopoly power, and by facilitating barriers to entry, the growth of IT has also had major negative economic, social, and political side effects, including the proliferation of “fake news.”
但是，对这些失败的反应是要求更大的经济一体化，包括成立“欧洲财政部”或由一名欧盟委员总览促进一体化大权等中间步骤。	The response to these failings, however, was a demand for greater economic integration, including such intermediate steps as the creation of a “European finance minister” or an EU commissioner with sweeping powers to facilitate closer integration.
美国的枪支法令我们摸不着头脑，我们也曾震惊于乔治·W·布什总统在其第一届任期内那种对科学的敌视态度，比如此人在气候变化和达尔文进化论上竟会如此顽固不化。	We scratch our heads about America’s gun laws. We were astonished during President George W. Bush’s first term at the administration’s hostility to science, reflected in its stance on climate change and Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution.
如果政策制定者在抑制通胀的正面性供应冲击的暂时性判断上出现了失误，那么政策正常化可能是错误的做法，而非常规政策应维持更长时间。	If policymakers are incorrect in assuming that the positive supply shocks holding down inflation are temporary, policy normalization may be the wrong approach, and unconventional policies should be sustained for longer.
但是，同样重要的是总统奥巴马对科罗拉多州和华盛顿州投票的反应 — — 在总统连任竞选过程中，奥巴马在这两个州中轻松获胜。	Just as important, however, was President Barack Obama’s reaction to the Colorado and Washington votes – both states that he won easily in his re-election bid.
随着电脑处理能力的增长和人工智能软件的进步，机器处理需要抽象思考的任务（比如推测含义和做出判断）的能力越来越强。	As computer-processing power grows and artificial-intelligence software advances, machines are increasingly able to perform complex tasks requiring abstract thinking, such as inferring meaning and making judgments.
她说“在胚胎植入前诊断不起作用且严重影响婴儿的风险高到或许值得尝试新技术的情况下，不愿使用捐献卵母细胞（卵子）的家庭少之又少 。 ”	She says, “There are very few families who don’t want to use donated oocytes (eggs), where PGD would not work, and where the risk of having severely affected babies is so high that it might be worth trying the new techniques.”
上个月，他宣称“欧洲每年80％的能源进口费用 — — 相当于3000亿欧元 — — 都用美元支付”的做法是“荒谬的 ” （ 同时只有约2％的能源来自美国 ） 。	Last month, he declared it “absurd” that “Europe pays for 80% of its energy import bill – worth €300 billion a year – in US dollars,” even though only about 2% of the EU’s energy imports come from the US.
而今天的法律却只允许掌握基本知识和技术的大学和企业从中受益，而提供人体组织的患者也许根本得不到补偿。	Today’s laws, however, allow only universities and industry, which supply basic knowledge and technology, to profit from their contributions; patients, who supply tissue, may not be compensated.
一度位居国际大行排行榜榜首苏格兰皇家银行（ Royal Bank of Scotland ）这样一棵大树，也正受欧盟委员会竞争总署（ Directorate General for Competition ）的修剪。	Institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland, which for a time in 2009 headed the list of the world’s largest international banks, are being pruned by the EU’s Directorate General for Competition.
尽管取得了如此出色的表现，雅罗斯瓦夫·卡钦斯基的法律与正义党仍然在波兰2015年议会选举中成功击败了公民纲领党。	Despite this strong performance, Jarosław Kaczyński’s Law and Justice (PiS) party resoundingly defeated PO in Poland’s 2015 parliamentary elections.
在朝鲜问题上，特朗普的方针更加鲁莽，他威胁说，如果朝鲜不同意放弃核计划，美国将“彻底摧毁”这个国家。	In the case of North Korea, Trump’s approach is even more reckless, threatening that the US will “totally destroy” the country if it does not agree to abandon its nuclear program.
如今，债务让发达国家难以回归2008年前的增长率，更不用说重塑大衰退不发生情况下GDP所能达到的水平了。	Today, debt is making it difficult for developed countries to resume pre-2008 growth rates, let alone restore the levels of GDP that would have been attained if the subsequent Great Recession had not happened.
以2014年西非埃博拉疫情为例：尽管在应对疟疾方面，支持项目和基础设施准备得十分充分，但各国对于处理新的卫生挑战几乎束手无策。	Consider the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa: despite ample support programs and infrastructure focused on confronting malaria, countries were not even remotely prepared to handle a new health challenge.
某些现任中情局官员仍坚持强调美国“强化审讯”计划（该计划已被奥巴马勒令停止）的价值，尽管参议院报告的结论是所采用的技术并没有产生任何有价值的情报。	For their part, some current CIA officials continue to insist on the value of America’s “enhanced interrogation” program (which Obama halted), despite the Senate report’s conclusion that the techniques it employed yielded no valuable intelligence.
这一手段在过去已经进行了尝试，也只在2002年失败过一次，当时阿根廷被迫在其外债上实施违约并打破维持了10年的阿根廷比索对美元1:1汇率。	This approach has been tried before, and it has failed only once, when Argentina had to default on its foreign debt in 2002 and break a decade-long 1:1 peg to the US dollar.
第二项因素是巴黎银行这个案子恰好是在美国检察机关饱受指责之时出现的，人们批评检察机构不愿向银行施压 ， “ 太大而不能送进监狱 ” ， 担心过度削弱银行将导致实体经济被削弱。	The second factor is that BNP’s case came to a head at a time when US prosecutors were being accused of treating banks as “too big to jail,” for fear that pressing charges against them would weaken them too much and thus undermine the real economy.
这种模式似乎 足够公平： 如果人们可以利用美貌或科学才华这样的自然禀赋获得收益，为什么人体组织就不可以？	This model seems fair enough: if people can exploit such natural endowments as their beauty or scientific genius, then why not their tissue?
老布什还尊重国内外制度和范式，要求美国国会授权参与海湾战争，要求联合国根据联合国宪章第七条给出决议。	Bush was also respectful of institutions and norms at home and abroad, going to the US Congress for authorization of the Gulf War, and to the United Nations for a resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.
除非我们能够克服普遍存在的错误担忧 — — AI 弊大于利，否则科技公司为全球南方所带来的令人难以置信的进步将日益放缓。	Unless we counter the misplaced but well-publicized fears that AI disruptions will be worse than the rewards, the incredible progress that technology companies are making in the Global South will be slowed.
据民意调查显示，战争带来的后果是美国的受拥护程度即便在英国、西班牙和意大利这些政府支持对伊战争的国家也大幅下降。	In the aftermath of the war, polls showed a dramatic decline in the popularity of the US even in countries like Britain, Spain, and Italy, whose governments supported the war.
毫无疑问，特朗普也想着自己能够完成这样的“壮举 ” ， 既中止罗伯特·穆勒（Robert Mueller）领衔的对他的调查，又让美国情报机关屈服于自己。	No doubt, Trump wishes that he could pull off such a stunt, and both halt the investigation of him led by Robert Mueller and bring to heel all of the US intelligence agencies.
但收入不平等在所有成员国都在稳步恶化，教育层次高的公民受益于服务业繁荣，而教育层次低的公民遭难于制造业向低成本地区的转移。	But income inequality was worsening steadily in all member countries, with more highly educated citizens benefiting from the booming services industry, while the less educated suffered as manufacturing moved to cheaper locations.
相比之下，国家转型计划的实施将意味着与时间赛跑，需要顶住低油价、全球经济疲软和全球化后退等来自外部的压力。	The implementation of the NTP, by contrast, will be a race against time and a fight against the external headwinds of low oil prices, a weaker global economy, and retreat from globalization.
因为有助于推动评估小组六项“减少需求”的干预性举措，包括研发新疫苗和改善诊断方法，设立市场进入奖至关重要。	A market-entry reward is crucial because it would also help to advance two of the Review’s six “demand-reducing” interventions: the development of new vaccines and improved diagnostics.
对于资本和大企业来说，欧盟成员国资格是经济上的必需品，直接通向5亿消费者以及合资格的廉价劳动力储备。	For capital and big business, EU membership is an economic imperative, offering access to 500 million consumers and reserves of cheap, qualified labor.
我给德瓦尔特发了一份《日内瓦公约》相关条款的文本，并询问他美国军方是如何根据公约来处理哈纳什的死亡的。	I sent DeWalt a copy of the relevant section of the Geneva Conventions and asked how the US military’s handling of al-Hanashi’s death conforms to it.
事实上更多的“一致”或者“统一”并不意味着就能提供有效 — — 甚至合理的 — — 欧盟问题应对方案。	More unification and harmonization does not necessarily lead to effective – or even reasonable – solutions to the EU’s troubles.
增加的成本其实算不上大（约每加仑0.3美元 ） ， 但法国燃油价格已经步入欧洲最高国家的行列（大约每加仑七美元，如果将现有税负计算在内 ） 。	The added cost was not all that large (about $0.30 per gallon), but fuel prices in France were already among the highest in Europe (roughly $7 per gallon, including existing taxes).
凝聚力、长期视角、适当激励、强大的“引导”能力以及果敢坚决是可贵的治国品质，特别是对需要管理复杂结构变化的精英指定制度来说。	Coherence, long time horizons, appropriate incentives, strong “navigational” skills, and decisiveness are desirable aspects of continuity in governance, especially in a meritocratic system managing complex structural shifts.
如果健康问题是糖尿病这样的慢性病，或者是癌症疝气等需要动手术的问题，那么等到需要时再保险策略就相当明智。	That wait-to-insure strategy makes sense if the medical condition is a chronic disease like diabetes or a condition requiring surgery, like cancer or a hernia.
但这些特征不是一夜之间具备的：对委内瑞拉财富的掠夺，对人权的大量侵犯，以及其决定对违宪，都不是7月30的新制宪大会选举才开始的。	But it did not tick them all at once: the plundering of Venezuela’s wealth, the gross violation of human rights, and the unconstitutionality of its decisions did not begin with the election of the new Constituent Assembly on July 30.
而且，该政府鼓励波斯尼亚的塞族共和国民主进步党的领导人威胁就有关从依旧脆弱的波斯尼亚分离举行自己的全民公决。	Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia’s Republika Srpska to threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia.
唯有果断抓住机会，南非才能成为非洲经济复兴的核心，而唯有抓住其地区领导者的角色，才能重振其自身的前景。	Only by boldly seizing the initiative can South Africa put itself at the core of Africa’s economic renewal, and only by embracing its role as regional leader can it revitalize its own prospects.
在多数后共产主义国家腐败指数下降的大背景下，在普京接替叶利钦出任总统后，俄国的所有腐败指数在过去几年内都有了大幅度提升，这一点丝毫也不值得大惊小怪。	Not surprisingly, all corruption indicators have been rising since Putin took over from Yeltsin, whereas they are falling in most post-communist countries.
比如，在埃及，占据议会多数的自由公正党（Freedom and Justice Party）宣布不能由女性出任总统。	In Egypt, for example, the Freedom and Justice Party, which dominates the parliament, claims that a woman cannot become President.
买鸡蛋不就是毫无必要地造成了（或间接造成了）动物的受苦 — — 如果下蛋的母鸡生活悲惨，被囚禁在狭小的铁丝笼中的话？	Isn’t buying eggs from hens who have led a miserable life, jammed into small wire cages, needlessly causing, or being complicit in causing, the suffering of animals?
欧元内部出现大规模违约相关危机会加剧这一风险。 违约相关的危机可能无法避免，而且会造成类似雷曼兄弟的连锁反应，摧毁整个欧元区。	That risk would be exacerbated by the eruption of a major default-related crisis within the eurozone, which might not be contained and, through a Lehman-like domino sequence, could jeopardize the entire edifice.
几十年来，美国烟草公司利用类似于TPP的协定所制定的外国投资者裁决机制对抗旨在遏制吸烟所造成的公共卫生危害的监管。	For decades, US-based tobacco companies have used foreign investor adjudication mechanisms created by agreements like the TPP to fight regulations intended to curb the public-health scourge of smoking.
普林斯顿 — — 继美国总统奥巴马接受控制叙利亚化学武器库存的国际倡议之后，美国军事打击叙利亚的可能性已经越来越小。	PRINCETON – The prospect of a US military strike on Syria has dimmed following President Barack Obama’s embrace of an international initiative to take control of Syria’s chemical-weapons stockpile.
“形”是“kata ” （ 模式）和“chi ” （ 魔力）这两个术语的组合，所以它包含了诸如“全部集合”和“讲述一个迷人故事的形态”这样意义上的微妙之处。	The word is a composite of two terms, “kata” (pattern) and “chi” (magical power), so it includes nuances such as “complete assembly” and “shape that tells an attractive story.”
然而恰恰相反，联合国依然听任穆加贝为所欲为，他一面宣称主权不可侵犯，一面却在国内大肆拘捕手无寸铁的平民。	Instead, the UN continues to defer to Mugabe, who hides behind claims of sovereignty while jailing a defenseless populace.
拜茶党僵化的意识形态所赐，尽管美国政府偿还其债务的法定能力一切正常，但对峙和边缘政策已经成为美国政坛的新暗语了。	Confrontation and brinkmanship have become the new watchwords of American politics, even when the US government’s legal ability to pay its debts is on the line, owing to the Tea Party’s ideological rigidity.
如果没有左翼候选人进入第二轮，左翼选民有可能像2002年曾经发生的那样将票投给“共和党统一联盟 ” ， 当时他们曾拱手送给希拉克一次对勒庞父亲让-马里·勒庞的大胜。	If no leftist candidate makes it to the second round, voters on the left could cast their votes for “Republican unity,” as they did in 2002, when they handed Chirac a landslide victory over Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
民主制度的核心弱点也使问题变得愈加严重：拉选票需要扩大社会福利，从而使能确保经济可持续发展但不受民众欢迎的举措无人问津。	The central weakness of democratic systems also contributes to the problem: The quest for votes favors the extension of social benefits and discourages unpopular measures that would put the economy on a more sustainable footing.
通常，这一原则意味着不同水平劳动所得、不同类型消费以及不同征收时间（现在或将来）的边际税率应该相似。	Usually, this principle means that marginal tax rates should be similar at different levels of labor income, for various types of consumption, for outlays today versus tomorrow, and so on.
倘若某个非政府组织在贫困人口医疗问题上取得了较大的成绩，那么大多数人就会视之为西方阴谋破坏的“第五纵队 ” ， 或者是某个利用大规模贫困做为生财之道的精英的遮羞布。	If a few NGOs have achieved great results fighting the ills of Africa’s poor, the vast majority are perceived as either a “fifth column” of the West or a refuge for fringe members of the elite who use widespread poverty as another source of lucre.
尽管只有少数几家学校会受到影响，但受冲击最严重的院校包括麻省理工学院、芝加哥大学、哈佛大学、斯坦福大学等主要研究重镇 — — 美国必须依赖这些研究所保持竞争优势。	While only a handful of schools will be affected, the hardest hit include major centers of research like MIT, the University of Chicago, Harvard, and Stanford – the very institutions the US must rely on to maintain a competitive advantage.
不管你是否同意，有一点是显而易见的：帝国主义并非如某些道貌岸然的英国辩护者所说的那样，是无私的事业（altruistic enterprise ） 。	Whether or not one agrees, one thing is clear: imperialism was not, as some disingenuous British apologists have claimed, an altruistic enterprise.
至于流动性，从表面上来看似乎更强了，但是美国证券交易委员会和美国商品期货交易委员关于“闪电崩盘”所做的联合报告表明高频交易的交易员大幅减少了流动性，导致问题更加严重。	There are lessons here for regulators. First, their monitoring of markets requires a quantum leap in sophistication and speed.
最有可能的结果是左翼联盟（Syriza）很快认输 — — 就像其他所有被选来承担改革使命的欧元区政府一样，然后回归三驾马车式的计划，只是把“三驾马车”的名头去掉。	The most likely outcome is that Syriza will soon admit defeat, like every other eurozone government supposedly elected on a reform mandate, and revert to a troika-style program, sweetened only by dropping the name “troika.”
目前，女性退休年龄是50岁，男性是55岁 — — 以全球标准来看显然过低，且考虑到中国人口迅速老龄化的趋势，这显然是不可持续的。	Currently, women can retire at the age of 50, and men at 55 – ridiculously low by global standards and clearly unsustainable, given China’s rapidly aging population.
货运无人机将在未来几年成为规模更大的产业，原因很简单 — — 摆脱了人类重量和生命支持系统，无人机可以以更低的成本实现同样程度快捷和安全的飞行。	Cargo drones will grow into an even larger industry in the coming years, simply because, unencumbered by the weight of humans and their life-support systems, they will fly more cheaply but be just as fast and safe.
在南非的邻国博茨瓦纳和纳米比亚为其大多数感染HIV病毒的国民提供抗逆转录酶病毒药物的时候，在姆贝基领导下的南非没有这样做。	While Botswana and Namibia, South Africa’s neighbors, provided anti-retrovirals to the majority of its citizens infected by HIV, South Africa under Mbeki failed to do so.
相反，美国把全部力量用在了货币宽松上，发动了我所谓的货币战争，在这场战争中，全球投资者为了追寻高收益，纷纷涌向新兴市场，推高了它们的汇率。	Instead, the US has placed all of its chips on monetary easing, unleashing what I have called a currency war, in which global investors, chasing higher yields, flood into emerging countries, driving up their exchange rates.
问题在于短期投资者不会坐等长期改革的成效 — — 它们更偏爱用短期对冲手段规避对冲不明确的短期汇率和其它宏观政策。	The problem is that short-term investors are unlikely to wait around for long-term reforms to pay off – preferring short-term hedges against unclear exchange-rate policy.
要充分理解这类“道德暴力”的恶劣性，想象彼此相爱、支持和肯定的朋友，以及这些行为对于他们的个体和集体存在有多重要。	To grasp fully the depravity of this type of “moral violence,” think of friends who love, approve, and affirm one another, and how important those actions are to their individual and collective existence.
普京承诺恢复民族自尊心（随着俄罗斯在1991年怅然失去超级大国地位而破碎 ） 。 其核心是胁迫欧洲接受俄罗斯在苏联解体后的国家里的“特权利益”范畴。	Putin’s promise to restore national self-respect, shattered by Russia’s bitter loss of superpower status in 1991, is centered around cowing Europe into submissively accepting Russia’s sphere of “privileged interest” in the post-Soviet nations.
柏林墙倒塌时，国家社会主义也随之倒塌，欧洲经济共同体创始成员国的应对之道是成立欧盟，并致力于加深欧洲一体化。	When the Berlin Wall came down – and state socialism along with it – the European Economic Community’s founding member states responded by establishing the European Union, and committing to deeper European integration.
通过散播恐惧和憎恨 ， ” 他说 ， “ 他们想要让难民在欧洲集中，切断他们与欧洲社会的联系，让他们成为欧洲仇外主义的受害者。	By spreading fear and loathing,” he says, “they wish to ghettoize refugees in Europe, to cut them off from European societies, to make them victims of European xenophobia.
Urlanis的观点是 — — 比起女人，男人才是更为敏感的生物 — — 这个观点在当今家庭生活质量恶化、一半婚姻以离婚收场、没有父亲的孩子数量不断上升至历史最高纪录的情况下，甚至更为贴切。	Urlanis’s argument – that men, not women, are the more delicate creatures – is even more relevant now, with family life decaying, half of marriages ending in divorce, and the number of fatherless children rising to record levels.
尽管2015年核协议没有能够满足伊朗的经济高期望，但当局仍在真主党、巴勒斯坦的哈马斯和也门的胡赛武装身上花费了数十亿美元。	Despite the failure of the 2015 nuclear deal to meet Iranians’ high economic expectations, the authorities continue to spend billions of dollars on the likes of Hezbollah, Hamas in Palestine, and the Houthis in Yemen.
在过去十年中，菲律宾当局提高了警惕，成立并强化了灾难管理机构，并致力于过去灾难（包括海燕台风）的重建工作。	Over the last decade, the country’s authorities have raised awareness, established and strengthened disaster-management institutions, and worked on recovering from past disasters, including Typhoon Haiyan.
纽约—如果发达和发展中国家的国家专利体系能够整合入贸易体系，将带来更大的投资者专业化，并随之产生更快的技术创新和生产率增长。	NEW YORK – If developed and developing countries’ national patent systems were integrated into the trade system, the result would be greater specialization among inventors and, with it, faster technological invention and productivity growth.
要想理解这一点，只需回顾一下今年夏天故去的三位备受尊敬的领导人：前联合国秘书长科菲·安南、前英国外交大臣兼北约秘书长彼得·卡林顿，还有美国参议员约翰·麦凯恩。	To understand them, it is worth looking at three reputable leaders who died this summer: former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former British Foreign Secretary and NATO Secretary-General Peter Carrington, and US Senator John McCain.
因此，美国消费的持续疲软意味着出口导向发展中经济体将承受压力。 好消息是这将迫使它们实施早就应该实施的以刺激国内消费需求为目标的再平衡战略。	So enduring weakness in US consumption implies pressure on the growth of export-led developing economies. The good news is that will force them to embrace long-overdue rebalancing strategies aimed at stimulating domestic consumer demand.
澳大利亚总理阿伯特在今年早些时候称日本为我们“在亚洲的好朋友”和“强大盟友 ” ， 他热烈欢迎“特殊关系”这一说法。	Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who earlier this year described Japan as both our “best friend in Asia” and a “strong ally,” has warmly embraced the “special relationship” language.
这就意味着，即便刘晓波和类似的异见人士得偿所愿，民主真的降临中国，但中国民族主义的问题仍将如影随形地存在。	This suggests that if Liu Xiaobo and like-minded dissidents ever got their wish, and democracy came to China, the problem of Chinese nationalism would not go away.
门垫事故所突出的最后一个问题是印度不容忍最轻微的冒犯的倾向 — — 如今这一倾向通过一位高级部长的手指头升级到官方政策高度。	The final issue that the doormat incident brought to the fore is Indians’ tendency to take offense at the slightest affront – a tendency that is now being elevated, by the thumbs of a top minister, to the level of official policy.
但是，在现在这种情况下，政府不一定要保释贝尔斯登 、美国国际集团或任何其他金融机构的债权人，这些机构将受益于保尔森的计划。	But in this case, the government does not have to bail out the debt-holders of Bear Sterns, AIG, or any of the other financial institutions that will benefit from Paulson’s plan.
如果所谓的经济增长是少数人囊括大部分收益，而其他人只能维持原状甚至减少，经济增长的概念就没有意义了。	If an economy can be said to be growing when a small minority receives most of the gains while everyone else’s lot stays the same or decreases, the concept of economic growth loses much of its meaning.
作为第五共和国总统，奥朗德公众支持度下降之快首屈一指 — — 对右翼来说，他太执着于统计数字，在财政上太过激进；对于真正的左翼来说，他又太温和，太过于社会民主。	His fall from public grace – too statist and fiscally intrusive for the right, but too moderate and social democratic for the true left – was more rapid than that of any president of the Fifth Republic.
而引入一些低贸易壁垒不大可能造成巨大损失的另一个原因是，在一个市场或另一个市场之间生产商品的成本差异很小。	Yet another reason why the introduction of some low trade barriers is unlikely to produce large losses is that the differences in the cost of producing goods in one market or the other are small.
但是，你无法摆脱一种不安感，即，当一切都说到做尽时，最新的科技创新对长期生活水平增长的贡献可能远远不如拥趸所宣称的。	Still, one cannot avoid the uneasy feeling that, when all is said and done, the contribution of recent technological innovations to long-term growth in living standards may be substantially less than the enthusiasts claim.
即便如此，在政府和支持政府并从中获益的政要切实致力于民主、善政和法治、并对国内民众负责之前，政变都将作为一种可行的选择。	Yet, until governments – and the elites that support and benefit from them – are prepared to commit to democracy, good governance, and the rule of law, and until they are accountable to their populations, coups will remain a viable option.
但是，大多数人，甚至在那些受到警告的国家的人们在通货膨胀或通货紧缩风险重要性的不容质疑的证据面前通常并未采取措施加以防范。	Yet, in the face of overwhelming evidence of the importance of inflation or deflation risk, most people – even in countries that have been warned – generally still have not taken steps to protect themselves.
从妇女占议员总数比例看，日本名列国际议会联盟（Inter-Parliamentary Union）189个国家的第158位。	The Inter-Parliamentary Union ranks Japan 158th out of 189 countries in terms of its ratio of female MPs.
充分就业的目标从西方领导人的视线中消失，尽管既不存在通货膨胀的威胁，也无法从扩大开放中得到额外的好处。	The goal of full employment dropped off Western leaders’ radar, even though there was neither a threat of inflation nor additional benefits to be gained from increased openness.
事实上，网络-物理系统涵盖了宏观层面（想一想城市交通，比��Uber）和微观层面（比如人类心脏的跳动 ） 。	Indeed, cyber-physical systems range from the macro level (think urban transport, like Uber) to the micro (say, the beating of a human heart).
3-5年后电池寿命终结导致很多住宅供电系��无法继续使用，大大影响了那些本以为可以终身供电的房主对于系统的信心。	Many residential systems break down after 3-5 years when the battery dies, undermining confidence in the system among owners who assumed that they had a lifetime supply of energy.
其他调查结果甚至更加利多；例如，年度爱德曼信任度调查报告发现记者正在重新赢得信誉，而对传统和在线新闻的总体信任则已达到七年来的顶峰。	Other surveys are even more bullish; for example, the annual Edelman Trust Barometer found that journalists are regaining their credibility, while overall trust in traditional and online-only journalism is at its highest point in seven years.
唯一的希望是停滞经济增长本身、削减消费、循环利用以及迫使人们更少生育，在比现在显著贫困的水平上实现社会稳定。	The only hope was to stop economic growth itself, cut consumption, recycle, and force people to have fewer children, stabilizing society at a significantly poorer level.
这样，利益共享者和投资者可以正确地判断他们提出的建议和进行的投资从长期看是否真的那么出色，而不仅仅是反映了一时的热情。	That way, shareholders and investors could properly judge whether the advice given and the investments made were in fact sound in the long run rather than just reflecting the enthusiasm of the moment.
显然，Werqit既是对LinkedIn的直白致敬（以及补充！ ） ， 也是LinkedIn只是部分涉足的领域的竞争对手。	Clearly, Werqit is both a flattering compliment (and complement!) to LinkedIn and a competitor for what LinkedIn does only in part.
绿色和平组织和其他反对使用转基因作物（GMO）的组织宣传反对引入可在人体内转换为维生素A的贝塔胡萝卜素。	Greenpeace, along with other organizations opposed to the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), has campaigned against the introduction of beta carotene, which is converted in the human body into vitamin A.
他们看过韩国电影、听过韩国音乐，用过其他韩国产品，他们知道政府宣传与国家惨淡现实之间存在着巨大的差异。	Exposed to South Korean movies, music, and other products, they recognize the yawning gap between their government’s propaganda and the country’s grim reality.
如果我们真的想要获取抗冲击能力，就必须推动严峻的系统性变革以解决生产和消费能源以及为经济提供资金的问题。	If we are serious about building resilience, we need to press ahead with tough systemic changes that address how we produce and consume energy and finance our economies.
普通日本人每天都要说无数次“斯米马赛 ” ， 有一点点事情或犯一点点错误就用这个词向朋友或陌生人致歉。	Ordinary Japanese say sumimasen countless times each day, to apologize to friends or strangers for even the most trivial accident or mistake.
在2008年和2012年，关注全球发展优先事项的几个哥本哈根共识项目都得出结论，指出政策制定者和慈善家应将对抗营养不良问题列为优先选项。	In both 2008 and 2012, Copenhagen Consensus projects focusing on global development priorities concluded that policymakers and philanthropists should make fighting malnourishment a top priority.
有证据表明，在发生金融危机的情况下，如果政策无效 — — 比如因为名义利率已经位于零区间 — — 赤字支出可以起到不同寻常的稳定效果。	There is evidence that in the wake of a financial crisis, when monetary policy becomes ineffective – for example, because nominal interest rates are at the zero bound – deficit spending can have an unusually strong stabilizing impact.
在这些“意向”变成“承诺”之前 ，捐款人应认真审查格鲁吉亚的经济发展战略并评估其人道主义援助和重建援助的计划。	Before these “pledges” become “commitments,” donors should carefully examine Georgia’s economic development strategy and assess its plans for humanitarian and reconstruction aid.
他们有着令人惊异的相似之处：出身平凡、克格勃背景、熟悉黑道、强健的心智与体格、对“人民公敌”的冷酷无情。	The similarities are striking: the modest social background, the KGB milieu, the criminal vocabulary, the mentality and physique, the mercilessness towards “enemies of the people.”
迄今为止，155个国家 — — 其中包括大的排放国 — — 已经向联合国递交了“决意为应对气候变化做出贡献 ” （ INDC）的计划。	So far, 155 countries – including large emitters – have submitted to the UN plans describing their “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDCs) to the fight against climate change.
毕竟，劳动套利一直都是全球供应链组织至少三十年来的核心驱动力 — — 当然，随着中国崛起带来的重大分配和就业效应，劳动套利的核心动力一直在加速。	After all, labor arbitrage has been the core driver of the organization of global supply chains for at least three decades – accelerating, of course, with China’s rise – with significant distributional and employment effects.
2008年全球危机爆发时，我们还没有保护跨国银行业务网的监管框架，因此暴露出了极大的脆弱性，比如杠杆率过高和外汇风险。	When the global crisis erupted in 2008, there was no regulatory framework to protect the cross-border networks, and large vulnerabilities, in the form of excessive leverage and foreign exchange, were exposed.
在对美元和其他货币基本均衡值进行估算的过程中，我已经研究出在同等条件下模拟某种货币“应当”以何种价格交易的完整算法。	In the course of estimating the underlying equilibrium value of the dollar and other currencies, I have developed a process for approximating where a currency “should” be trading, all things being equal.
因此，法国不仅扮演了建设欧洲团结的催化剂，也协助创造了欧洲战后年代标志性的繁荣 — — 这样的繁荣目前正处在全球金融和经济危机的威胁之中。	In doing so, France became the catalyst not only for building European unity, but also for creating the prosperity that marked Europe’s post-war decades – a prosperity now under threat because of the global financial and economic crisis.
按照历史经验，如今像中国这样富裕的经济体应该以每年3-5%的速度增长，而不是像中国当局通过财政和信贷刺激来实现的6%或更高的增长率。	When China grows, it sucks in imports from other countries, giving the global economy a big boost. Rapid Chinese growth revved up the world economy between 2004 and 2006, in 2009-10, and in 2017.
他将佛罗里达州前州长杰布·布什（Jeb Bush）称为“低能”人士，这严重挫伤了这位（甚至在他正式加入选战前就）被许多人当成最喜爱的候选人。	His depiction of former Florida governor Jeb Bush as a man of “low energy” has done real damage to a candidate whom many had assumed – even before he formally entered the race – would be the favorite.
要实现上述目标并防止欧佩克解体，唯一的办法可能是包括美国在内的生产商减少轻质原油生产并因此失去市场份额。	The only way to do that – and prevent an OPEC breakup – would be to reduce the production of light sweet crude, including by US producers, which would thus lose market share.
讨论记录35年后在《肯尼迪录音带 》 （ The Kennedy Tapes）一书中被披露，堪称应用博弈论的经典。	The transcripts, released 35 years later in the book The Kennedy Tapes, reveal applied game theory at its best.
在英国，虚假和扭曲的说法，比如来自欧洲其他地区的不受限制的移民正在导致工资下降，部分助推了英国退欧公投。	In the United Kingdom, the Brexit vote was fueled partly by false and distorted claims, such as that unrestrained migration from the rest of Europe was driving down wages.
此前，胡主席已数次到过华盛顿进行“工作访问 ” ， 但此次访问是他成为中国国家主席8年来首次正式“国事访问 ” 。	Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi was sent to Washington last week to apply the final touches to the preparations.
国际货币基金组织在2013年提到欧洲，加拿大和某些新兴市场国家已经出现了“房地产市场过热的迹象 ” 。	The International Monetary Fund noted in 2013 that there were already “signs of overheating in real-estate markets” in Europe, Canada, and some emerging-market economies.
这些国债可以在任何时候卖给欧洲央行，换取等额现金；但是，只要它们的收益率高于欧洲央行存款，银行持有国债就是有利可图的。	The T-bills could be sold to the ECB at any time, making them tantamount to cash; but, as long as they yield more than deposits with the ECB, the banks would find it advantageous to hold them.
因此，在即将到来的仙台联合国会议上，世界领导人应该形成一致，通过修订HFA加大措施力度治理因海平面上升、全球变暖、大规模城市化和人口快速增加带来的风险。	That is why, at the upcoming UN conference in Sendai, world leaders must agree, through a revised HFA, to scale up their efforts to cope with the risks posed by rising sea levels, global warming, rampant urbanization, and rapid population growth.
目前，与加拿大的协定也已板上钉钉（尽管与印度的双边谈判陷入了停滞，其原因可能是印度人不相信自由贸易协定对本国有多大帮助 ） 。	An agreement with Canada is now within reach (though bilateral negotiations with India seem to have stalled, probably because the Indians do not believe that a free-trade agreement would help them much).
马克里并未像与克里斯蒂娜·基什内尔那样发表冗长的演讲，但却拒绝举行记者招待会及回答记者提问。 相反，马克里回答了在场记者的所有提问。	Unlike Cristina Kirchner, who gave long-winded speeches but held no press conferences and took no questions from journalists, Macri answered queries until reporters had none left.
这对于制定有效措施来应对结构性变化至关重要，特别是在处理经过40年高速增长和发展后产生的，包括腐败、不平等、与环境污染等，一系列经济与社会顽症的时候。	This is vital to enable an effective response to the structural problems – such as corruption, environmental pollution, and inequality – that more than two generations of rapid growth and development have brought.
维尔莱格认为，能源独立“可能将世界带入新美国世纪（New American Century ） ， 形成一个美国能够以比世界其他地方低得多的成本获得能源的经济环境 ” 。	Verleger argues that energy independence “could make this the New American Century by creating an economic environment where the United States enjoys access to energy supplies at much lower cost than other parts of the world.”
即使在经济快速增长的新兴市场国家，新富们也对穷人的苦难视而不见，只有政治动乱迫近的威胁才能令他们有所醒悟，就像在沙特那样。	But, in rapidly growing emerging-market countries, the rich tend to close their eyes to the suffering of the poorest, except when they feel threatened by the risk of political upheaval, as in, say, Saudi Arabia.
远离世界技术前沿的国家因为模仿已有技术并根据本地条件改造而获益，但假以时日，这些国家必须改善自身创新能力。	Countries far from the world technology frontier are better off imitating existing technologies and adapting them to local conditions, but over time such countries must improve their capacity for innovation.
同时，华尔街巨头及其董事们对美国政府已经没什么好担心的了，相反，他们现在在完成这个不诚实的计划的共同冒险中，成为了美国政府的合作伙伴。	Meanwhile, Wall Street chieftains and their boards of directors have nothing to fear from government. On the contrary, they are now the government’s partners in a joint venture to manage this dishonest scheme.
二战后在经济合作与发展组织国家中成功实施的财政巩固政策表明：每1美元的税务上升所带来的效应平均需要5~6美元的支出削减来抵消。	Successful post-World War II fiscal consolidation in OECD countries averaged $5-$6 in spending cuts per $1 of tax hikes.
事实上，另一项对于1213名病人在中风后六个月所作的14项随机调查的统计，对有否运用针灸作为一种针对传统中风康复护理的补充治疗手段的效果进行了对比。	Indeed, another analysis, including 14 randomized trials with 1,213 patients six months after a stroke, compared the effects of conventional stroke rehabilitation with and without acupuncture as a supplement.
但是，尽管忧虑重重 — — 并且自由互联网本身也孕育着危险 — — 但世界决不能放弃利用网络空间的转型潜力。	Yet, despite the fears – and the dangers inherent in a free Internet – the world must not give up exploring the transformative potential of cyberspace.
如果每个人都只盯着自己的利益，那我们就将面临集体性危机 — — 看看当今应对全球气候问题时的乱象就知道了。	If we all think only of our own interests, we are headed for collective disaster – just look at what we are doing to our planet’s climate.
欧盟的劳动力流动规定本身并不是设立以促进移徙本身的；相反，它们旨在通过支持一体化、扩大劳动力市场和加强经济调整机制来促进欧盟经济。	The EU’s labor-mobility provisions were not put in place to facilitate migration per se; rather, they were aimed at bolstering the EU economy by supporting integration, expanding the labor market, and strengthening economic adjustment mechanisms.
几年前还不可想象的事情 — — 攻击民主盟友、赞美独裁者；还将自由媒体称为“人民的敌人 ” ； 阻止难民并让他们骨肉分离的美国总统 — — 现在已经几乎见怪不怪。	What was unimaginable only a few years ago – a US president insulting democratic allies and praising dictators, or calling the free press “enemies of the people,” or locking up refugees and taking away their children – has become almost normal now.
纽约 — — 作为一名在朝鲜战争中成长起来的孩子，我对贫困感同身受。 每天我都要面对贫困；我就生活在其中。	NEW YORK – Growing up as a child during the Korean War, I knew poverty first hand. I saw it around me every day; I lived it.
推动中国数字经济取得如此瞩目进步的是阿里巴巴、百度和腾讯等互联网巨头，这些巨头正在大规模地将其服务商业化，为全球带来新的商业模式。	Powering China’s impressive progress in the digital economy are Internet giants like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent, which are commercializing their services on a massive scale, and bringing new business models to the world.
直到20世纪70年代发生过度通胀，央行才发现 — — 或者，从某种程度上讲，是重新发现 — — 保持货币价值稳定是值得追求的。	It was not until the excessive inflation of the 1970s that central banks discovered – or, in a sense, rediscovered – the desirability of keeping the value of money stable.
美国财政部长小摩根索（Henry Morgenthau, Jr . ） 在1945年的著作《德国是我们的问题 》 （ Germany is Our Problem）中指出，摩根索计划的目的是将德国转变为“以农业和牧业为主”的国家，以此防止它参与新战争。	The plan’s aim – articulated by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr., in his 1945 book Germany is Our Problem – was to convert Germany into a “principally agricultural and pastoral” country, in order to prevent its involvement in any new wars.
为此之前用于生产这类产品的银行贷款、劳动力，土地和其他资源都需要进行重新部署，而且最可能流向那些中国具有真正比较优势的部门，包括出口制造业。	The bank loans, labor, land, and other resources that were previously deployed to produce those goods will need to be redeployed, most likely to sectors where China has a true comparative advantage, including export manufacturing.
纳税人已经不堪重负了，居然还要看着，他们的钱被拿去支付银行家的天价奖金和红利 — — 据说这是为了确保银行能继续放贷，以促进经济复苏。	Already heavily burdened taxpayers saw their money – intended to help banks lend so that the economy could be revived – go to pay outsized bonuses and dividends.
许多人在提到巴塞尔银行监督委员会（Basel Committee on Banking Supervision）做恍然状，表示认识这个为银行规定资本标准的机构。	Many people show some spark of recognition at the mention of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which sets capital standards for banks.
就在不久前， 英中两国政府、威康信托基金、美国生物医学高级研究与发展管理局（BARDA）以及丹麦制药企业诺和诺德联合成立了新的资助计划。	Just recently, new joint funding initiatives were launched by the British and Chinese governments, the Wellcome Trust, the United States’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo.
（而其他民主国家，比如英国和西班牙，通常的做法就是在普通刑事法庭审讯恐怖嫌疑犯，甚至包括某些基地组织嫌疑人。 ）	(Other democracies, such as the United Kingdom and Spain, always try terrorism suspects, including alleged Al Qaida members, in ordinary criminal trials).
那些赞成维持现状的北欧银行家都喜欢引用俄国小说家陀思妥耶夫斯基的名言 ： “ 金钱是凝固在货币里的自由 。 ”	Northern European central bankers who favor the status quo like to quote Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky: “Money is coined liberty.”
此外，欧盟给小国提供了介于德国和俄罗斯之间的某种程度的政治稳定和安全，这是他们在现代史中从未有过的。	Moreover, the EU offers the small countries sandwiched between Germany and Russia a degree of political stability and security that they never had in modern history.
当然，产生这种情况的一部分原因是因为中美两国的经济和政治力量对比在近��年间已经发生了变化，尤其是经历了最近的全球金融危机之后。	Of course, this is partly because of the changes in the relative economic and political power of the US and China over the past decade, and especially during the current global economic crisis.
这些研究确认了一个早已存在的理论 — — 地球有一个能源预算，这一能源预算受大气顶部辐射波动的影响，但将该预算分解为表面和深海是十分困难的。	It confirms the long-held theory that the earth has an energy budget that is affected by radiative perturbations at the top of the atmosphere, though partitioning that energy between the surface and the deeper oceans has been difficult.
实现这一目标的一个可能方法是建立独立的委员会，这使欧盟所谓的财政契约现在对欧元区的所有国家都有约束力。	One possible vehicle for accomplishing this is the independent councils that the EU’s so-called fiscal compact has now made mandatory for every country in the eurozone.
纽约—美国众议院议长保罗·瑞恩（Paul Ryan）在1月份任期届满退休时，他有望获得拿到每年超80,000美元政府退休金的资格。	NEW YORK – When the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, retires at the end of his term in January, he will likely qualify for an annual government pension of more than $80,000.
即便在种植转基因作物的情况下，不科学、过于繁琐的监管程序也显著提高了新作物的生产成本，导致很多潜在的重要品种无法进入市场。	Even where GE crops are being cultivated, unscientific, excessively burdensome regulation has raised the cost of producing new plant varieties significantly, keeping many potentially important ones from the market.
受精卵变成胚胎，然后变成胎儿，这些最初的干细胞不知怎的告诉他们的子细胞如何成为皮肤、肝脏、眼睛以及骨头。	As a fertilized egg turns into an embryo, and then a fetus, those initial stem cells somehow show their daughter cells how to become skin, liver, eye, or bone.
关键在于服务业最终得和高速生产率增长的金融业、制造业和信息技术行业在同一个国家的劳动力市场里争夺劳动力。	The problem is that service industries ultimately have to compete for workers in the same national labor pool as sectors with fast productivity growth, such as finance, manufacturing, and information technology.
卢拉治下的把戏实施了家庭补助金（Bolsa Familia）计划，该计划向家庭直接派发现金，将数百万人带出了贫困。	Brazil under Lula implemented Bolsa Familia, a system of direct cash payments to households that is credited with lifting millions out of poverty.
流动性注入和低利率都会产生一定的微观经济效应，但这一效应未能得到多少关注：它们降低了资本相对于劳力的成本，也就相应降低了对劳力需求。	Liquidity injections and low interest rates have a microeconomic effect that has received little attention: they lower the cost of capital vis-à-vis the cost of labor, which causes a relative decline in demand for labor.
人们有时把瑞典的经济和社会体制称为“瑞典模式 ” ， 要末把它描绘成为理想的模式，要末就是不正常的模式。	Sweden’s economic and social system, sometimes called the “Swedish Model,” is often depicted either as an ideal or an abnormality.
他的布道可以赢得整个足球场的听众并且获得诺贝尔和平奖，但是全世界的政治领导人却担心冒犯中国而回避与他公开会见。	His sermons fill football stadiums and he has won a Nobel Prize, but political leaders around the world shirk from meeting him openly, for fear of offending China.
发自北京 — — 从去年十一月以来，经济学家和媒体都都在为供应侧结构改革大唱赞歌，视之为破除中国经济困境的开创性解决方案。	BEIJING – Since last November, economists and the media alike have been hailing supply-side structural reform as a groundbreaking solution to China’s economic woes.
一些分析家将1945年后的时期称为美国领导的、以自由为特征的层级秩序，其中美国提供公共品并在弱国也能赢得话语权的松散的多边规则和机构体系中施展。	Some analysts describe the post-1945 period as a US-led hierarchical order with liberal characteristics, in which the US provided public goods while operating within a loose system of multilateral rules and institutions that gave weaker states a say.
以古巴为靠山根本没有可能，因为劳尔·卡斯特罗正一心一意地幻想按中国式的一党资本主义模式重塑古巴已经垮掉的经济。	Cuba is out of the question as a patron, due to its preoccupation with Raúl Castro’s efforts to reshape its depleted economy in an improbable bid for Chinese-style capitalism in a one-party state.
默克尔教条认为危机爆发的原因正是政府的挥霍无度，因此只有用“严厉”的预算平衡规定才能防止危机再度发生。	The Merkel doctrine holds that the crisis is the result of government profligacy, so only a “hard” balanced-budget rule can prevent such crises from recurring.
所有人都同意，现行制度有着致命的缺陷：从全球标准看，美国公司税率太高，而由于各种扭曲经济决策的税收减免和特殊优惠，公司税基又太窄。	The current system, all agree, is deeply flawed: the corporate tax rate is too high by global standards, and the corporate tax base is too narrow, owing to numerous credits, deductions, and special provisions that distort economic decisions.
这可以为经济增长创造更多机会、改善医疗及其他服务、助推社会发展，并实际及象征性地拓展人们对世界的认识。	This will create even more opportunities for economic growth, improve access to health care and other services, contribute to social development, and broaden – both figuratively and literally – people’s worldview.
在新兴经济体中，中国可能在2014年出现硬着陆，如果关键的结构性改革受到阻碍的话。 而其他金砖国家需要摆脱国家资本主义的束缚。	Among emerging economies, China could face a hard landing by late 2014 if critical structural reforms are postponed, and the other BRICs need to turn away from state capitalism.
弗氏夫妇的小政府自由主义基本上便以这三个结论作为基础，故而从今天看也早已站不住脚，因为世界似乎并不赞同他们关于自己如何运转的结论。	Their case for small-government libertarianism rested largely on those claims, and has now largely crumbled, because the world, it turned out, disagreed with them about how it works.
我们现在已知特朗普与普京关系那份臭名昭著 “档案”中某些关键日期和细节已经得到证实，它们是由一位前英国情报官员负责搜集的。	We now know that some key dates and details in the infamous “dossier” on Trump’s relations with Putin, assembled by a former British intelligence officer, have been verified.
就如毛泽东的画像从来没有从天安门上取下来过一样，毛泽东革命的所有元素也一直存留于中国的制度、思维方式以及与世界的互动模式中。	Just as Mao’s portrait has never been taken down from The Gate of Heavenly Peace, so whole elements of his revolution continue to survive in China’s institutions, ways of thinking, and modes of interacting with the world.
事实上，这些国家已经出现粮食和石油的相对价格的巨幅上扬、穷人的粮食危机和由商品价格上涨所引起的更高的通货膨胀。	Indeed, these countries are already experiencing large relative price increases for food and oil, a food emergency for the poor, and higher rates of inflation induced by commodity price shifts.
根据这些数据，数字广告商和零售商将为您提供更昂贵的手表，家居饰品或机票，而不是向搜索同一类别商品的低收入用户提供。	And with these data, digital advertisers and retailers will offer you more expensive watches, home furnishings, or airline tickets than they would to a lower-income user searching within the same categories.
但同样不可或缺的是一种热情表达的道德信念，即“在我们的学校中学习的移民的女儿”是共同的我们中间的真正的一员，拥有完全的权利。	Yet just as indispensable is the moral conviction, passionately expressed, that the “immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools” is a genuine member, with full rights, of that common us.
纽约 — — 执政一年半期间，乌兹别克总统夏尔卡特·米尔齐约耶夫一直将新闻自由作为其改革计划的标志性项目。	NEW YORK – During his first year and a half in office, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has made press freedom a signature item of his reform agenda.
我有一些担忧，以最近20年来的时间坐标轴来看，作为世界经济引擎的美国和中国，最近的经济增长明显有所放缓。	I have trouble seeing how the US and China, the main engines of global growth for two decades, can avoid settling on a notably lower average growth rate than they enjoyed before the crisis.
国家主义允许社会地位变动；两者的共同作用造就了精神失常；而自杀和非理性暴力则是新精神疾病的表现形式。	It was nationalism that legitimated mobility; the two of them together that produced madness; and the new mental disease that expressed itself in suicide and irrational violence.
这粗看之下是有道理的：据估计各种形式的知识产权“盗窃”行为至少令美国经济损失了2250亿美元（相当于其GDP的1 ％ ） 。	On the face of it, this makes some sense: it is estimated that various forms of “theft” of intellectual property cost the US economy at least $225 billion (1% of GDP).
德克萨斯州大学城 — — 将战争和个人罪恶混为一谈如果不是现代国际政治中人们的共同选择，也无疑已经成为一种普遍现象。	COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS – Equating war with individual evil has become ubiquitous – if not universal – in contemporary international politics.
如果澳大利亚想要彻底摆脱中国的干涉， 不但需要实施新的国内防御，还需要更加积极的参与捍卫国际（不论是陆上还是海上）规则与规范。	If Australia is to free itself of Chinese meddling, it will need to go beyond implementing new domestic safeguards to take a more active role in defending rules and norms beyond its borders, both on land and at sea.
普京曾多次提到欧亚主义是俄意识形态的重要组成部分，甚至把它作为前苏联国家蓬勃发展的“欧亚经济联盟”贸易区的基本原则来加以引述。	On several occasions, Putin has referred to Eurasianism as an important part of Russian ideology; he has even invoked it as a founding principle of the “Eurasian Economic Union,” a burgeoning trade area of former Soviet states.
他在卫生领域的最大贡献之一 — — 审慎地使用数据 — — 正在印证另一大贡献的重要性：投资于卫生和卫生设施。	One of his most significant contributions to the field of health care – the judicious use of data – is confirming the importance of another: investment in hygiene and sanitation.
如果发生了环境变化这一不可能事件，奥巴马可以以积极和平缔造者的姿态介入，他的此次以色列之行将具有历史意义，成为以巴关系的转折点。	In the unlikely event that circumstances change, Obama could step in as an active peacemaker, giving his trip to Israel historic significance as a turning point in Israel-Palestine relations.
议会在政治进程中发挥着自己的作用，它能够促进或阻碍政策变化：保守的议会在改革派总统卡塔米任期的最后一年对其施政的阻挠就是例证。	The majlis plays a role in the political process, to the point of being able to induce or hinder policy changes: witness the way a conservative majlis blocked reformist President Mohammad Khatami in the last years of his term.
事实上，以色列和约旦部队正在合作防止各自边境被伊拉克或叙利亚圣战份子渗透，而埃及和以色列在西奈半岛的目标也是共同的。	Indeed, Israeli and Jordanian forces are now working together to secure their respective borders against infiltration by jihadists from Iraq or Syria, while Egypt and Israel now share the same objective in Sinai.
我们致力于营造一种环境，让农村贫困男女可以种植和出售更多的粮食，增加他们的收入并决定自己生活的方向。	We work to create conditions in which poor rural women and men can grow and sell more food, increase their incomes, and determine the direction of their own lives.
一条全面禁止核爆的禁令将阻碍现有核武器库的升级以及新武器的研究开发，消灭现有以及潜在核武国家的核能力。	A complete ban on all nuclear explosions would hamper the upgrading of existing nuclear arsenals and the development of new weapons, diminishing the capabilities of both current and potential nuclear-armed states.
华沙 — — 拥有欧洲（实际是整个经合组织）最佳经济记录的政府怎会遭到怀疑欧洲、奉行民族主义且不懂经济的反对党的羞辱 — — 短短一年前人们还认为反对党不可能在选举中获胜。	WARSAW – How can a government with the best economic record in Europe (indeed in the entire OECD) be humiliated at the polls by a Euroskeptic, nationalistic, and economically illiterate opposition – one deemed unelectable only a year ago?
对于面临来自能够结合颠覆性内容和大平台的新来者的激烈竞争的企业来说，挑战尤其艰巨，甚至是致命的 — — 显著的例子包括亚马逊、Facebook、谷歌、奈飞和优步等。	The challenge has proven particularly severe, if not fatal, for those facing intense competition from entrants able to combine disruptive content and big platforms – the most notable examples being Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix, and Uber.
"政治学家特德·格尔（Ted Gurr）提出的""政治计划""和自由之家组织每年一度的《世界自由》调查几乎囊括了对各个国家的政治权利评价。"	Two initiatives - the Polity Project, founded by political scientist Ted Gurr, and Freedom House's annual Freedom in the World surveys - gauge political rights in almost every country.
多年来，该地区主要国家 — — 其中包括沙特阿拉伯和卡塔尔等西方的宠儿 — — 实际上已经在向圣战份子缴纳保护费。	For years, key states in the region – some of them, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, darlings of the West – have essentially paid protection money to jihadists.
虽然他的国家安全班子组成的人员大部分支持伊拉克战争，但奥巴马已经明确表示，他的议程包括从伊拉克撤军。	Although his national security team consists of people who largely supported the war in Iraq, Obama has made it clear that his agenda includes withdrawing troops from that country.
美中之间的较量包含一定的均是因素，中国大规模的军事建设就是明证，但主要领域还是经济、政治以及影响力。	While this rivalry will have a military component, as evidenced by China’s enormous military buildup, it will manifest itself primarily in terms of economic, political, and normative spheres of influence.
通常来说，经济学家会将货币贬值视为平衡一个国家外部账户的有效手段，因为这会提高进口成本而拉低出口成本，进而令前者下降而后者上升。	Economists would typically argue that the way to balance a country’s external accounts is through a fall in its currency, which would make imports more expensive and exports cheaper, causing the former to fall and the latter to rise.
那些阻碍短期资本流入的税收工具和准备金要求应与反周期措施紧密结合，例如提出额外的资本要求以遏制国内的信贷活动。	Tax instruments and reserve requirements that put sand in the wheels of short-term capital inflows should be combined with strong countercyclical measures, such as additional capital requirements, to slow domestic credit creation.
如果用死刑处罚人身攻击，那么罪犯就有动机杀死其受害者来避免被发现（这也是处罚的程度一般应当与犯罪的严重性相匹配的主要原因 ） 。	If assault were punished with execution, perpetrators would have an incentive to kill their victims to avoid discovery (which is a major reason why the severity of punishments more generally should be matched to the severity of crimes).
新机构和新战略的喧嚣令人想起拥有许多新进入者的充满活力的初创企业，而这在某种意义上恰恰是反特朗普抗议运动正在采取的形式。	The buzz of new organization and strategies recalls nothing so much as a dynamic start-up industry with many new entrants, which, in a sense, is exactly what the anti-Trump resistance has become.
联合国发展计划署以及整个联合国体系都支持政府更加强调通过强化计划和按需行动的机构能力以降低灾难风险的措施（包括灾难预防 ） 。	The UNDP, and the wider UN system, is supporting governments as they place greater emphasis on disaster-risk reduction, including preparedness, by strengthening their institutional capacity to plan and act when needed.
在与新教竞争这个问题上，过去两任教皇的一个重要特征是他们宣福的人的地理分布重心开始移出传统重镇欧洲。	With respect to competition with Protestants, the key feature of the last two popes is the shift in the geographical distribution of blessed persons away from the traditional dominance of Europe.
当这场危机变成数百万人失业 — — 特别是那些找不到工作、眼看将沦为失落的一代的欧洲年轻人 — — 的悲惨现实时，欧盟机构也沦为了千夫所指的对象。	Once the crisis became a sad daily reality for millions of unemployed – particularly for what appears to be a lost generation of young, jobless Europeans – EU institutions also became a target of popular rage.
埃及政府需要维持稳定的外国融资,以支撑整个国家,并以此来平衡国际上对穆尔西施行的有违埃及基本人权 的措施的反对之声。	Egypt’s government needs to secure consistent foreign financing to keep the country afloat, providing leverage for international opposition to Morsi’s efforts to impose an agenda that runs contrary to Egyptians’ fundamental rights.
即便如此，运作独立性的丧失 — — 在不受干扰的情况下为实现其与政治当局协商后制定的既定目标而采取行动的能力 — — 对中央银行信誉的打击也是致命的。	Nonetheless, the loss of operational independence – the ability to act without interference in pursuit of its stated objectives, developed in consultation with political authorities – can also be fatal to a central bank’s credibility.
而且，将在某一货币市场持有多头的风险与汇率偏离同位水平联系在一起表明了思考中央银行如何影响市场来限制偏离同位。	Moreover, relating the riskiness of holding an open position in a currency market to the exchange rate’s divergence from parity levels suggests a novel way to think about how central banks can influence the market to limit departures from parity.
这一方针在经济政策上的应用很快就来了。 特朗普新闻秘书西恩·斯派塞（Sean Spicer）拒绝透露失业率是多少 — — 从而回避要求他说出实际数字的问题。	The first application of this approach to economic policy came quickly, when Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, refused to say what the unemployment rate is – dodging a question that would have required him to state the actual number.
但是，在卢拉（在墨西哥则是比森特·福克斯和费利佩·卡德隆）任内，这一模式却变成了直接帮助当前贫困人口脱贫的项目。	But there are doubts as to what it can achieve in the long run to eradicate poverty.
经济学是一个有着多种模型的工具 — — 每一种都代表着现实生活的某个方面，经济学家的能力就体现在如何运用正确的模式来解决当前问题。	Economics is really a toolkit with multiple models – each a different, stylized representation of some aspect of reality. One’s skill as an economist depends on the ability to pick and choose the right model for the situation.
鉴于出口产品中的德国附加值总量增长仅仅是由于德国专门从事与出口有关的生产的效应，因此，不能因此而得出较佳的评估。	A favorable assessment cannot rest on the fact that the overall German value-added in exports has been growing because this is simply an effect of the German specialization in export-related production.
事实上，中国应当表明态度，尽管也很希望朝鲜能继续存在并走向繁荣，但倘若后者一意孤行，它也有能力承担这个昔日盟友土崩瓦解的后果。	Indeed, China should make clear that, much as it would prefer North Korea to survive and prosper, it could afford to allow its erstwhile ally to implode.
可以理解，许多领导人（最著名的是德国总理安吉拉·默克尔）担心广泛的宏观经济刺激的长期后果。 这些担心是有根据的。	A number of leaders, most prominently German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are understandably worried about the longer-term consequences of aggressive macroeconomic stimulus.
正如我在2016年出版的那本介绍货币历史，现在和未来的书中所强调的那样，当涉及到新形式的货币时，创新工作可能会由私营部门来完成，但政府会在适当的时候会对其进行监管并据为己有。	As I emphasized in my 2016 book on the past, present, and future of currency, when it comes to new forms of money, the private sector may innovate, but in due time the government regulates and appropriates.
再比如巴西、西班牙和其他许多国家爆出的腐败丑闻，即使在执政党高层腐败丑闻公之于众后政府仍然留在台上。	Or consider corruption scandals in Brazil, Spain, and many other countries, where governments remain in power even after high-level corruption within the ruling party has been exposed.
就像印度的数百万消费者跳过固定电话和翻盖手机直接从无电话跨越到智能手机一样，中国消费者现在也实现了类似的跨越并采用了各类新技术。	Just as millions of consumers in India went directly from no phones to smartphones – skipping landlines and flip phones altogether – Chinese consumers are now doing the same, and across a wide range of new technologies.
Con la derrota de Hitler, una vez más pasó a ser parte de la esfera rusa, esta vez de los soviéticos.	With Hitler’s defeat, it once again became part of the Russian sphere, this time of Soviet Russia.
在美国，最新经济数据 — — 包括疲软的劳动力市场数据 — — 确认了增长不振的现状，2012年下半年产出不可能大大超过1—6月份的1.6%的年增长率。	In the United States, the latest economic data – including a weak labor market – confirm that growth is anemic, with output in the second half of 2012 unlikely to be significantly stronger than the 1.6% annual gain recorded in January-June.
反恐怖主义法在这里是个问题，因为对更有效的国际金融转移控制机制的需求为汇款操作人员造成了额外的负担。	Anti-terrorism laws are a problem here, because the demand for more effective control mechanisms on international financial transfers places an extra burden on remittance operators.
在国际层面，这可以通过扩大现有计划或建立新的专门基金 — — 如艾滋病、结核病和疟疾全球防治基金（Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria ） — —实现。	This can be achieved on the international level by expanding existing programs or establishing new stand-alone funds, analogous to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
哥本哈根—遏制全球变暖、加强环境保护的力量必须做好准备成为唐纳德·特朗普赢得美国总统竞选的附带牺牲品。	COPENHAGEN – The forces fighting global warming and battling to strengthen environmental protection must brace for heavy collateral damage as a result of Donald Trump’s victory in the United States’ presidential election.
在这样的背景下，城市集群或将成为创新创业的关键，特别是服务业，同时也是遏制资源浪费、避免进一步环境破坏和缓解城市因过度拥挤而阻塞的关键。	In this context, city clusters could be essential to innovation and job creation, particularly in the service sector, while limiting resource wastage, avoiding further environmental degradation, and easing urban congestion from overcrowding.
美国总统巴拉克在2015 年的内罗毕演讲中指出 ， “ 除非一个国家能够依赖全体人民的才华，否则它就无法实现全部潜能 。 ”	As US President Barack Obama put it in a 2015 speech in Nairobi, “no country can achieve its full potential unless it draws on the talents of all its people.”
但这种蛋白质也与MS有关，研究者在测试时发现，奥法木单抗（Arzerra的活跃成分）有利于MS和（有可能）其他自身免疫系统缺陷病人。	But this protein is also associated with MS, and researchers found during testing that ofatumumab, which is the active ingredient in the medicine, could be of benefit to MS and possibly other autoimmune patients.
而对于亚洲人，欧洲要不是现代化的楷模，如明治维新时期的日本；要不就如中国人所认为的，是腐朽没落的晴雨表。	Asians, for their part, viewed Europe as either a model of modernity, as in Meiji Japan, or a barometer of decay, as in China.
尽管挪威、瑞典、丹麦荷兰和卢森堡已经实现0.7%的目标，但就全球平均水平而言，这一比例从1960年的0.5%下降到了今天的0.3 % 。	Although Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have achieved the 0.7% target, the global average has actually declined, from 0.5% of GDP in 1960 to 0.3% today.
因此总而言之，即使边境调整税会不直接使美国商品更具竞争力，倒也是个提高收入的有效方式，或许能为其他减税措施腾出空间。	So, all in all, even if a border adjustment tax does not directly make US goods more competitive, it is an efficient way to raise revenues, potentially making room for other tax cuts.
而由麦肯锡国际研究中心所发布的一项最新报告则显示，不断转化的人口构成已经对许多新兴经济体的增长前景构成了更为重大的威胁。	But a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) shows that shifting demographics pose an even greater threat to the growth prospects of many emerging economies.
而那3个未签署该条约并实施了核试验的国家 — — 印度，巴基斯坦和朝鲜 — — 则遭到了来自联合国安理会的国际谴责以及相关制裁。	The three countries that have failed to ratify the CTBT and have tested such devices – India, Pakistan, and North Korea – have faced universal condemnation from the UN Security Council, and UN sanctions.
在旨在纠正市场失灵的国际层面的监管改革方面已有了一些进展，尽管这些努力因为金融机构的坚决抵制而收效甚微。	There has been some progress at the international level on regulatory reforms aimed at addressing market failures, though such efforts have been limited by strident resistance from financial institutions.
而到1942年，59岁的熊彼特出版资本主义、社会主义和民主一书时，他意识到许多创新其实都来源于面临竞争非常有限的大型企业。	By 1942 when a 59-year-old Schumpeter published the book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, he realized that a lot of the innovation was coming from very large corporations that faced rather limited competition.
例如，当我牵头组织一项针对抗菌素耐药性的调查报告时，我了解到铜具有强大的抗菌性能，是用来制造那些经常附着和传播细菌的医疗保健设施的理想材料。	For example, when I led a review on antimicrobial resistance, I learned that copper has powerful antibacterial properties and is an ideal material for use in health-care facilities where bacteria often spread.
正如美国前总统约翰·F·肯尼迪（John F. Kennedy）在1963年10月一次提议降低企业和个人税率的演讲中所说的那样 ： “ 潮水一涨，万帆皆高 ” 。	As former US President John F. Kennedy famously said in an October 1963 speech in which he promoted his proposed corporate and personal tax reductions, “a rising tide lifts all boats.”
正如国际货币基金组织警告的那样 ： “ 排除商品之外的核心通胀率已经从2%增加到3.75 % ， 意味着通胀的影响正不断扩大 。 ”	As the IMF cautions, “core inflation – excluding commodities – has risen from 2% to 3.75%, suggesting that inflation is broadening.”
在韩国，LG公司最近提出了一项计划，从公众那里征求创新思想，承诺如若公司将发明项目商业化，则发明人能获得此过程中高达8%的权益。	In South Korea, LG recently launched a program to solicit invention ideas from the public, promising inventors a hefty 8% stake in the proceeds of any ideas the company commercializes.
并不是所有的实验都是成功的，许多实验虽然有利于GDP增长，但也同时导致了产能过剩、污染、腐败和“鬼城”等问题。	Some experiments have had less clear results, making, say, a positive contribution to GDP growth, but also contributing to problems like excess industrial capacity, pollution, corruption, and the creation of ghost towns.
许多法律体系现在认为，至少对于财产侵害而言，当唯一可用的选择就是击毙小偷的时候，这个受害者必需是愿意放弃其财产的。	Many legal systems now take the position that, with regard to property offenses at least, the victim must be willing to surrender his property when the only available option is to kill the thief.
鉴于中国实行严格的官僚体制，只允许在职业阶梯上一步步向上爬，因此像美国总统奥巴马那样相对年轻、缺乏经验但却充满活力且鼓舞人心的领导者几乎不可能出现。	Given that the Chinese system is rigidly bureaucratic, permitting only gradual ascent up the career ladder, it is impossible for a young and relatively inexperienced but dynamic and inspiring leader – like, say, US President Barack Obama – to emerge.
尽管如此，当选官员仍觉得托宾税具有相当大的吸引力，因为它能够让批评之声有所消停，还能把公众目光从经济政策（特别是预算、债务和增长疲软）等基本但又不具有政治可行性的问题上转移开去。	Nonetheless, elected officials find a Tobin tax highly appealing, because it could blunt criticism and divert attention from fundamental, but politically paralyzing, problems surrounding economic policy, particularly budgets, debt, and slow growth.
倘若这是必需，那么在2015年年底意大利的公共债务相当于GDP的133％而葡萄牙则为129 ％ ， 试问这两个国家现在也得被迫进行债务重组吗？	At the end of 2015, Italy’s public debt was 133% of GDP, and the ratio for Portugal was 129%. Should Italy and Portugal now be forced to restructure their debt, too?
首先，英国可以谈判以优惠条件在欧盟内部出售其商品的提法就没有什么意义，因为欧洲统一市场对英国出口企业的意义远大于英国市场之于欧洲。	For starters, the argument that the UK could negotiate favorable terms for selling its goods in the EU makes little sense, as Europe’s single market matters far more to British exporters than the UK market matters to European businesses.
日本银行将其资产负债表规模扩大至GDP的近60 % — —比美联储还要高一倍 — — 但它发现，其结束通缩的努力正在日益失效。	After expanding its balance sheet to nearly 60% of GDP – double the size of the Fed’s – the BOJ is finding that its campaign to end deflation is increasingly ineffective.
执政六个月后，特朗普还没有一项立法成就值得宣扬（尽管他宣称参议院批准尼尔·哥萨奇（Neil Gorsuch）为新的最高法院法官是一场胜利 ） 。	At the end of six months in office, Trump doesn’t have a single legislative achievement to crow about (though he has claimed the Senate’s approval of Neil Gorsuch as a new Supreme Court justice as a victory).
奥巴马拒绝了他的前任小布什的孤立“流氓国家”的政策，承认美国影响被孤立国家行为的唯一希望是直接参与到与它们的双边环境中。	Obama rejected his predecessor George W. Bush’s policy of isolating “rogue states,” recognizing that America’s only hope for influencing isolated countries’ behavior was to engage directly with them in a bilateral context.
但对于那些只能将自身非熟练劳动力出售给市场换取主要收入来源的西方人而言，全球化时代等同于数十年的工资水平停滞。	But for Westerners whose primary source of income is the sale of their unskilled labor to the marketplace, the era of globalization has coincided with decades of wage stagnation.
但是正像世界银行的Louis Kuijs指出的，中国区别于许多其他发展中国家的地方不是在于中国家庭把他们极大部分的收入存了起来，而是在于企业也是如此。	But as Louis Kuijs of the World Bank has pointed out, what sets China apart from many other developing countries is not that households save uniquely high levels of their income, but that enterprises do.
事实上，几个月前，人们还普遍预期主流右翼总统候选人共和党人弗朗索瓦·菲永能够在首轮选举中以较大优势领先其他候选人。	In fact, until a few months ago, its presidential candidate, the Republicans’ François Fillon, was expected to lead the pack in the first round by a wide margin.
这就象全球对民主和法律的普世价值的尊重，和维护人权和少数族权益一样的重要，因为这是关乎国际秩序的安全。	But as important as this goal is for international order and security, of equal importance is respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, as well as the establishment, on a global scale, of democracy and the rule of law.
纽约 — — 上月底，太多意大利人投票选举一位声名狼藉的商业大亨和一名喜剧演员导致欧洲股市出现暴跌。	NEW YORK – When too many Italians voted late last month for either a louche and discredited business tycoon or a comedian, European stock markets plummeted.
他以为他—和财政部长保罗•奥尼尔—能够通过兵不血刃的“内部博弈”赢得理智的政策而不用诉诸可能会使他2004年连任失败的“外部博弈 ” 。	He thought that he – and Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill – could win the quiet “inside game” for sensible policy without resorting to an “outside game” that would make his reappointment in 2004 unlikely.
始作俑者或许是年轻新教徒彼得·博切特，他感到自己必须杀死同为新教徒、但却同情天主教的皇家委员克里斯托弗·哈顿。	The first such case was likely that of Peter Berchet, a young Protestant, who felt that he had to kill the royal councilor Christopher Hatton, also a Protestant, whom Berchet believed to be a Catholic sympathizer.
在一开始敲响警钟的根本问题 — — 包括房地产泡沫、地方政府债务、影子银行活动迅速扩张、公司杠杆率高企等 — — 仍没有解决。	The fundamental problems that triggered alarm bells in the first place – including real-estate bubbles, local-government debt, rapid growth in shadow-banking activity, and rising corporate leverage ratios – remain unresolved.
这也是国际公众舆论认识到该岛还存在难民问题的有数几个场合之一，究其原因，已经很少有人知道这场战争中仍然有难民存在。	This was also one of the few occasions when international public opinion became aware that there was a refugee problem on the island, because few people knew that refugees from that war still exist.
毫无疑问，德国是欧洲最重要的经济体；而其低失业和相对稳固的公共财政状况也表明它是表现最出色的经济体 — — 至少目前是如此。	Germany is undoubtedly Europe’s most important economy; and, with low unemployment and relatively sound public finances, it is also the best-performing one – at least for the time being.
但是当金融危机像达摩克利斯剑悬在达沃斯与会代表的头上时，问题正在变成“国家和国际组织怎样拯救商界 ？ ”	But, with the financial crisis hanging over Davos participants’ heads like the sword of Damocles, the question is becoming, “Can states and international institutions save business?”
例如，皮肤细胞或者肝脏细胞只能复制更多的皮肤或者肝脏。 作为人类发育开端中最为活跃的细胞，干细胞是“主”细胞。	Whereas a skin cell or a liver cell, for instance, can reproduce only more skin or liver, stem cells, which are the most robust at the beginning of human development, are “master” cells.
这次衰退的规模如此巨大，以至于世界经济所有主要地区的失业率都将大幅度攀升，美国的失业率可能会达到9 % — 10 % 。	The size of this downturn is so large that unemployment will rise sharply in all major regions of the world economy, perhaps reaching 9-10% in the US.
如果能财政和银行业联盟方面迈出坚实的一步，情况可能会有所改善；但在缺乏政策以强化稳定和可持续性的情况下，最终崩溃的可能性却要大得多。	With a determined move toward fiscal and banking union, things could be much better. But, in the absence of policies to strengthen stability and sustainability, the chances of an eventual collapse are much greater.
目前美国国债利率仍然很低，因此这一威胁还比较遥远，但一旦利率正常化以后，未来赤字将会远高于政府的预测值。	Interest rates on US government debt remain low, so this threat is prospective, but future deficits will be far higher than government projections when rates normalize.
面对高速发展的中印等国持续不断的需求压力，有人因此预测说未来能源价格将保持高昂、能源供给短缺，经济和社会都将面临困境，甚至将因此引发能源战争。	In the face of relentless demand-side pressure, driven mainly by high-growth countries like China and India, some predict stratospheric energy prices, supply shortages, economic and social hardship, and even resource wars.
但是，如果我们看看历史纪录就会发现，20世纪50年代和60年代的自由主义体制比随后的保守主义体制更为成功。	But if we look at the historical record, the liberal regime of the 1950’s and 1960’s was more successful than the conservative regime that followed.
让情况更糟糕的是，与此同时，在贸易和其他全球化位面的推动下，具系统重要性的新兴国家步入了它们的“发展突破阶段 ” 。	To make matters worse, this occurred at a time when systemically important emerging economies hit their “developmental breakout phase,” powered by trade and other aspects of globalization.
任何将精灵捉回瓶子中的尝试不但可能触发贸易战，对经济增长造成 严重后果，也无法让贸易退回到50年前的水平。	Any effort to put the genie back in the bottle might not only trigger trade wars, with serious consequences for economic growth, but would also fail to reduce trade to the levels of 50 years ago.
我们认为可以通过对其他前50家药企销售额小额征税的方式设立有效的市场准入奖励，因为这其他50家制药企业并没有承担他们应尽的义务。	We determined that an effective market-entry reward could be funded by small levies on the sales of the other top-50 pharmaceutical firms that are not carrying their weight.
比如，亚马逊公司的土耳其机器人（Mechanical Turk）计划宣称要让客户“能获得190个国家的500,000多工人的服务 ， ” 并打出了“人工人工智能”的宣传口号。	For example, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk program claims to give its customers “access to more than 500,000 workers from 190 countries,” and is marketed as a form of “artificial artificial intelligence.”
9月14日，美国和俄罗斯在日内瓦签订协议，将叙利亚化学武器问题置于国际控制之下，俄罗斯凭此重回国际舞台 — — 这一回决不是仅仅作为反角。	With the US-Russian agreement, signed in Geneva on September 14, to place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control, Russia has returned to the global scene – and not only because of its nuisance value.
8月，LBS将430万美国人归于长期失业，他们站总失业人口的37.9 % — —这个比例令人担忧，因为全球金融危机已经过去五年了。	In August, the BLS classified 4.3 million Americans as long-term unemployed, or 37.9% of the total unemployed – a worrisome figure, given that the global financial crisis was five years ago.
例如，俄罗斯已经同意向铝业巨头奥列格·德里帕斯卡（Oleg Deripaska ） （ 在危机发生前，他在福布斯财富排名榜上排名第一）提供42亿美元贷款，供其偿还对西方债权人的债务。	For example, the state has granted a $4.2 billion loan to the aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska (who held first place on the Forbes list before the crisis) to pay off Western creditors.
25年前，前苏联帝国范围内首个独立的公民运动“团结工会”宣告成立，尽管它所产生的政治影响不可忽视，但“团结”从本质上看既非政治运动亦非工会组织。	Although the rise 25 years ago of Solidarity, the first independent civic movement in the former Soviet empire, had huge political consequences, Solidarity was, primarily, neither a political movement nor a labor union.
考虑到导致危机的全球贸易失衡依然存在，增加竞争力只能获得一场惨胜 — — 而且对各国国内生活水平和消费都会带来惨重打击。	Given that the global imbalances that led to the crisis remain unaddressed, increased competitiveness will be a Pyrrhic victory – and one that will exact a severe toll on domestic living standards and consumption.
据一份议会报告指出 ， “ 建设这样一个超级电网的成本将极为高昂 … … 但将带来大量经济利益 — — 包括在离岸可再生能源行业的数万新工作职位 。 ”	"According to a parliamentary report, “the cost of developing such a supergrid could be very high...but it may bring a host of economic benefits – including tens of thousands of new jobs in the offshore renewable industry."""
拉米罗·阿布雷乌，这个在1980年和1990年代为古巴的美洲部“统治”着萨尔瓦多的家伙，他仍然活跃着，但他现在更象是一个商人和一名资深的政治家，而不是古巴的操手。	Ramiro Abreu, who “ran” El Salvador for Cuba’s Department of the Americas in the 1980’s and 1990’s, remains active, but now more as a businessman and a senior statesman than as a Cuban operative.
而在斯里兰卡，我的政府最近为了实现更大的经济一体化计划于印度签署的“经济和技术协议”也遭到了猛烈的政治抨击。	And in Sri Lanka, the “economic and technology agreement” that my government recently planned to sign with India, in order to bring about greater economic integration, has come under ferocious political attack.
近20年前，朱佩因为实施���需的改革而成为法国最不受欢迎的政客之一，如今，他或许因为幸灾乐祸而得到了原谅。	Juppé, whose efforts nearly 20 years ago to impose badly needed reforms made him one of the country’s most unpopular politicians, might be forgiven a bit of schadenfreude.
最终，尽管财政部赞扬了倒闭银行基本破产（basic bankruptcy）的优点，但拒绝撤销监管机构领衔银行重组的权力。	Ultimately, while the Treasury extolled the virtues of basic bankruptcy for failed banks, it rejected repealing regulators’ powers to lead bank restructurings.
我们希望希腊不会被迫离开欧元区，尽管临时性措施 — — 比如采取资本管制 — — 也许最终对于防止金融崩溃必不可少。	Greece, one hopes, will not be forced to leave the eurozone, though temporary options such as imposing capital controls may ultimately prove necessary to prevent a financial meltdown.
如果美国和中国想重新参与双方都面临的地缘战略和经济挑战，那么接受共同责任、解决网络紧张对立是至关重要的。	Acceptance of shared responsibilities in coming to grips with cyber tensions is essential if the US and China are to re-engage on the other geostrategic and economic challenges that they both face.
关键是核不扩散审查会议的代表要共同努力为核裁军建立法治规则，并填补核不扩散条约的空白，使所有大规模杀伤性武器中最不人道的武器再无容身之地。	It is crucial that representatives at the NPT review conference work together to bring the rule of law to nuclear disarmament and close the gap in the NPT that has permitted the most inhumane of all weapons of mass destruction to continue to exist.
1824年，英国历史学家托马斯·麦考莱（Thomas B. Macaulay）观察到 ， “ 自由贸易 — — 政府能够给予人民的最大福祉 — — 几乎在所有国家都不受欢迎 。 ”	In 1824, the British historian Thomas B. Macaulay observed that “free trade – one of the greatest blessings which government can confer on its people – is in almost every country unpopular.”
我们还将加快韩国-东盟自由贸易协定（FTA）进一步自由化的谈判，从而为更自由、更包容的地区增长铺平道路。	We will also accelerate the pace of negotiations for the further liberalization of a Korea-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA), in order to pave the way for freer and more inclusive growth in the region.
