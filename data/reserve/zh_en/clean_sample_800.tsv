尽管这些行动大部分都是在地面进行，但是在索马里海岸执行代号为 “ 亚特兰大 ” 的行动也见证了欧盟的首次海上行动。	Although they have mostly been on land, operation “Atlanta” off the coast of Somalia saw the EU’s first naval operation.
一战后，英国陆军元帅阿奇博尔德·韦维尔颇有预见性地指出 ， “ 在‘以战争结束战争’后，胜利者似乎成功地在巴黎达到了‘以和平结束和平的目的 ’ ” 。	After World War I, the British field marshal Archibald Wavell presciently observed that, “After ‘the war to end war,’” the victors “seem to have been pretty successful in Paris at making a ‘Peace to end Peace.’”
如果没有第二大支柱 ， “ 世界工厂”就只能是海市蜃楼。 这第二大支柱便是“���国基础设施网 ” ， 大部分由物流、能源、公路、通讯、航运和港口等行业的垂直整合型国有企业建设和经营。	The “world factory” could not have been built without the second pillar: the “China infrastructure network,” installed and operated mostly by vertically integrated state-owned enterprises in logistics, energy, roads, telecoms, shipping, and ports.
在确定2016年的“八大任务”中，李克强将供给侧改革排在第二 — — 仅次于应对增长放缓的经济稳定政策。	In identifying the top “eight tasks” for 2016, Li put supply-side reforms at number two – second only to the government’s focus on economic stability in countering China’s growth slowdown.
伯克利-虽然奥巴马新政府统领着全球注意力，美国的未来却可能-正如以前曾多次出现的那样-由其最大州决定。	Berkeley – While the new Obama administration is commanding global attention, America’s future may be written – as so many times before – in and by its largest state.
但是，人们有理由要问什么时候才能对非洲非人的贫困给出一个可持续的解决方案，不仅仅是依靠八国领导人和“Live 8”世界群星扶贫义演音乐会的组织者，而且要同样依靠非洲的领导人和及其人民。	But it is fair to ask when a sustainable solution to Africa’s dehumanizing poverty will be found, not only by the G8 and the organizers of Live 8, but also by Africa’s leaders and people.
与诺德豪斯证明2.5℃的温度限额几乎不可能实现的谨慎研究相反，有人正在不断煽动将全球温度上升保持在困难得多的1.5℃阈值以下的热情。	Contrast Nordhaus’s careful work showing that a 2.5°C cap is near impossible, with the excitement being whipped up about keeping the rise in global temperature below the much harder 1.5°C threshold.
还有NBA自己的明星球员罗恩·阿泰斯特（Ron Artest）曾因在2004赛季的一场比赛中冲上观众席与球迷扭打而遭停赛 — — 他如今将自己的名字改成爱·世界和平（Metta World Peace ） ， 或许是为了改过自新吧。	In the NBA itself, a star player, Ron Artest, was suspended for the remainder of the 2004 season after going into the stands and brawling with heckling fans during a game. (Artest has now changed his name to Metta World Peace, perhaps in response.)
而我作为一个觉得中国崛起将对世界有利的人，则希望那些以为目前正是时候大展拳脚的中国官员们，能听一下邓小平的箴言。	As someone who believes that China’s rise should be good for the world, I hope that Deng’s wise advice will be heeded by those Chinese officials who seem to think that this is a good moment to start stamping their feet.
可悲的是，在目前看来，自从约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯解释了由于市场需求的不足，经济是如何受制于失业率的理论之后，宏观经济学家们并没有什么新的贡献。	Sadly, in view of today’s needs, macroeconomists have made little progress on policy since John Maynard Keynes explained how economies could get stuck in unemployment due to deficient aggregate demand.
但即便是资本市场在企业融资中扮演着更重要角色的英美两国，资产价格的膨胀也无力去鼓励消费者消费或企业投资。	But, even in the US and Britain, where capital markets play a much larger role in corporate finance, asset-price inflation did little to encourage consumers to spend or companies to invest.
如今，欧盟似乎无力阻止极权民粹主义在其创始成员国的崛起，保持凝聚力需要新的泛欧洲叙事，这个叙事要糅合多样的民族历史和政治习性。	Now that the EU seems incapable of stemming its rise among the bloc’s own founding members, maintaining cohesion would require a new pan-European narrative, one that incorporates diverse national histories and political idiosyncrasies.
9月以来在日本政府、商界和劳工领袖间进行的激烈讨论正在产生向上的良性循环 — — 工资增加带来更鲁棒的增长。	Intensive discussions since September among Japanese government, business, and labor leaders have been geared toward setting in motion an upward, virtuous cycle whereby increased wages lead to more robust growth.
但这样的媒体报导不够高瞻远瞩，未能全面理解人们和企业创造新业务方式的过程中，伴随着新形式电子货币变化的所有内涵。	But media coverage has failed to look far enough into the future, and to comprehend the full extent of the changes that will be wrought by new forms of electronic money, as people and businesses invent new ways of doing business.
大家都是人，减轻危害措施全球通行，更何况最大的受益者就是这些国家本身 — — 减少艾滋病毒传播，犯罪率下降，吸毒者也能重新投入工作。	Humans are humans. Harm reduction works everywhere, and the main financial benefactors are the countries themselves, which see reduced spread of HIV, drops in crime, and people returning to work.
尽管亚洲国家在这方面已经有了长足的进步，但在非洲国家，生活在极端贫困中的人口却比1990年增长了1亿4千万。	Although good progress in meeting these goals has been made in Asia, in Africa there are now 140 million more people living in extreme poverty than there were in 1990.
对于不是那么贵的鞋子，由于投入到生产过程中无形的部分的资金比较少，这个数字不是那么高，但是仍然超过了50 % 。	For less expensive shoes, with lower sums invested in the intangible parts of the production process, this figure was not as high, but still more than 50%.
2006年，在付出了5000万宗本可预防的疟疾死亡的代价之后，联合国所属世界卫生组织逆转禁令，批准将DDT用于杀灭和驱赶疟蚊。	In 2006, after roughly 50 million preventable deaths, the United Nations’ World Health Organization reversed course and endorsed the use of DDT to kill and repel Anopheles mosquitoes.
而且事实上，据美国情报部门的估测显示 ，截至去年9月，从土耳其流向叙利亚加入伊斯兰国等组织的国外招募者数量已经从高峰时期的每月2，000人减少到区区50人左右。	And, indeed, US intelligence estimates indicate that, by last September, the flow of foreign recruits crossing from Turkey into Syria to join groups like ISIS had dropped from a high of 2,000 per month to as few as 50.
奥巴马的连任给出了一个信号，一个只有在言论不脱离实际的情况下才会引起广泛共鸣（包括在过美国国内）的信号，这在奥巴马的第一个任期中屡试不爽。	Obama’s reelection sends a message, but one that will resonate widely – including at home – only if rhetoric does not depart from reality, as was too often the case during Obama’s first term.
或者，如精神病医生兹维·瑞斯（Zvi Rex）的名言所说 ， “ 由于奥斯维辛，德国人永远不会原谅犹太人 。 ”	Or, as the psychiatrist Zvi Rex famously quipped, “Germans will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz.”
正如喜剧演员鲍勃·纽哈特（Bob Newhart）所观察到的 ， “ 教皇让我们孤独；我们也让教皇孤独 。 ”	As the comedian Bob Newhart observed, “The pope leaves us alone; we leave the pope alone.”
正常人经常都需要并应该得到帮助，但提供何种帮助不应该基于将他们的状况定义为精神障碍的错误决定，以及因此导致的错误处理。	Normal individuals often need and deserve help, but the decision as to the kind of help they get should not be biased by incorrect labeling of their conditions as mental disorders that suggest something is internally wrong with them.
在2012年里约+20峰会（Rio+20 Summit）的倡导下，70个国家的政府（包括40个中低收入国家）支持自然资本核算。	Following a campaign at the 2012 Rio+20 Summit, 70 governments, including those representing 40 middle- and low-income countries, endorsed natural capital accounting.
如果健康问题是糖尿病这样的慢性病，或者是癌症疝气等需要动手术的问题，那么等到需要时再保险策略就相当明智。	That wait-to-insure strategy makes sense if the medical condition is a chronic disease like diabetes or a condition requiring surgery, like cancer or a hernia.
卢旺达政府最近在全国课程体系中纳入了阿卡兹·卡诺泽计划的方法，让中等学校和TVET学生具备取得成功所需要的软技能。	The government recently integrated Akazi Kanoze’s approach in the national curriculum to equip secondary and TVET students with the soft skills they require to succeed.
2015年他确保了与六国 — — 中国、法国、德国、俄罗斯、英国和美国 — — 以及欧盟达成协议，暂停伊朗核计划以换取经济援助。	And, in 2015, he secured a deal with six countries – China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – along with the European Union to halt Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for economic relief.
可悲的是，乌克兰并不是唯一的例子：1958至1961年毛泽东在中国开展的大跃进造成的人员伤亡更大，估计导致大概1，500万到4，500万人死于非命。	Sadly, Ukraine is not the only example: The human toll in China of Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward of 1958-1961 was even greater, causing an estimated 15-45 million deaths.
佛山市政府在20世纪80年代初便是第一批试点乡镇企业和民营经济的地方政府之一，在培养民营企业方面起到了重要的领头作用。	Foshan’s municipal government, which was among the first to experiment with township and village enterprises and privatization in the early 1980s, has played an important role in buoying private enterprise.
如今，发展专家大体上都来自新兴和发展中国家 — — 毕竟，这些国家生活在发展中 — — 因此，世界银行行长应该出自这些国家中的一个似乎是理所当然的。	Since expertise on development by and large lies within the emerging and developing countries – after all, they live development – it seems natural that the World Bank’s head would come from one of those countries.
首先，总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德（François Hollande）担心欧元会对其他世界主要货币升值，并呼吁设定汇率目标。	First, President François Hollande, worried about the euro’s appreciation against other major world currencies, called for an exchange-rate target.
在贸易方面，美国总统特朗普不断升级的对华贸易战升级正在占据新闻头条，但特朗普在远非批评中国的唯一一人。	When it comes to trade, US President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war with China is grabbing headlines, but Trump is far from alone in criticizing China.
因此，在即将到来的仙台联合国会议上，世界领导人应该形成一致，通过修订HFA加大措施力度治理因海平面上升、全球变暖、大规模城市化和人口快速增加带来的风险。	That is why, at the upcoming UN conference in Sendai, world leaders must agree, through a revised HFA, to scale up their efforts to cope with the risks posed by rising sea levels, global warming, rampant urbanization, and rapid population growth.
此外，欧盟给小国提供了介于德国和俄罗斯之间的某种程度的政治稳定和安全，这是他们在现代史中从未有过的。	Moreover, the EU offers the small countries sandwiched between Germany and Russia a degree of political stability and security that they never had in modern history.
考虑到如此大的反对，宪法第9条的实际修改而不只是重新解释看起来并不可行，特别是在明确以和平主义为旗帜的公明党仍身处执政联盟中的情况下。	Given such opposition, an actual revision of Article 9, rather than just a reinterpretation, does not seem feasible, especially while the avowedly pacifist Komeito party remains part of the ruling coalition.
我坚信欧盟的新成员不会忘记自己曾经有过的极权主义和以非暴力方式对抗罪恶的经历，而他们在欧盟团体内的处事方式会体现出他们的上述经历。	I firmly believe that the new members of the EU will not forget their experience of totalitarianism and non-violent opposition to evil, and that that experience will be reflected in how they behave in EU bodies.
尽管这带来的是可比性甚低的指标族，仍然有待标准化，但这些努力是令人鼓舞的信号 — — 微观金融业开始致力于捍卫其在金融服务生态系统中的地位。	While this has resulted in a rather disparate set of indicators, which must be standardized, such efforts are an encouraging sign of the microfinance industry’s commitment to securing its role in the financial-services ecosystem.
大陆自由贸易区是非洲联盟（AU）2063年议程框架下的12个旗舰计划之一，该计划可以使非洲国家内部贸易量增长一倍，并为非洲大陆带来巨大的利益。	The CFTA – one of 12 flagship programs under the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063 framework – could double intra-African trade and bring enormous benefits to the continent.
毫无疑问，德国是欧洲最重要的经济体；而其低失业和相对稳固的公共财政状况也表明它是表现最出色的经济体 — — 至少目前是如此。	Germany is undoubtedly Europe’s most important economy; and, with low unemployment and relatively sound public finances, it is also the best-performing one – at least for the time being.
欧元区财政部长会议和国际货币基金组织（International Monetary Fund，简称IMF）已与希腊达成一致，应国际货币基金组织的要求为该国提供一定金额的债务减免，并发放103亿欧元（约合116亿美元）的救助资金。	Eurozone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund have agreed with Greece to begin, per the IMF’s demands, providing some debt relief to the country, and to release €10.3 billion ($11.6 billion) in bailout funds.
这两种支柱方法组成了对于来自短期经济分析与那些来自长期货币分析的指数进行反复核对的框架，以便得出对于影响价格稳定的风险因素的一个坚实的观点。	This two pillar approach constitutes a framework for cross-checking indications from the shorter-term economic analysis with those from the longer-term monetary analysis in order to obtain a robust view about the risks to price stability.
正因如此，现在就开始做出变化从而实现未来退休金稳定对美国 — — 以及世界各地的其他许多国家 — — 来说至关重要。	That is why it is important for the US – and for many countries around the world – to act now to make the changes needed to stabilize future pension finances.
但如果一国不能通过偿债能力测试，IMF就会对其债券持有人施加足够规模的“剃头 ” （ haircut ） ， 以使其符合“高概率”标准从而能够得到IMF的援助。	But if a country fails the solvency test, it must impose a sufficiently deep haircut on its bondholders to bring it to the “high probability” standard needed to qualify for IMF assistance.
我对20世纪80年代末仍然记忆犹新，这不仅是因为那时对自由的期待，而且因为对我刚出生的女儿来说，一点儿婴儿食品都没有。	I remember the late 1980’s not only for its hopes for freedom, but also for a total absence of baby food for my newborn daughter.
但最近一段时间，欧洲和美国的经济窘境吸引了人们的目光，以至于许多事关亚洲能否持续保持成功的严峻挑战都被忽视了。	But the current focus on economic malaise in Europe and the United States is distracting attention from the many serious challenges that call into question Asia’s continued success.
鉴于这个国际货币基金组织用来跟踪自身金融交易的特别提款权其实并没有什么重要性，中国当局将人民币往里面塞的努力也更多就是摆个花架子而��。	Given that the SDR, which the IMF uses to keep track of its own financial transactions, is of little practical importance, the Chinese authorities’ effort to add the renminbi to it amounts to little more than a vanity project.
如果能实现这一点，美国企业就可以在中国做生意而无须被迫支付如此巨大的竞争代价，而关税的威胁也将成为一个极为有效的贸易政策工具。	If that happens, and US firms can do business in China without being compelled to pay such a steep competitive price, the threat of tariffs will have been a very successful tool of trade policy.
比如，华坚鞋业、C&H服饰和JD集团（一家成衣制造商）目前分别在埃塞俄比亚、卢旺达和坦桑尼亚的特别经济区设厂经营。	For example, the Huajian Shoemaking Company, C&H Garments, and China JD Group (an apparel maker), are now operating in special economic zones in, respectively, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania.
他认为，这将带来分裂和反动政治 ： “ 没有转移支付，你就无法让外围趋同，这将造成走向极端化的政治分歧 。 ”	That, he believes, is a recipe for disintegration and reactionary politics: “Without transfers, you will not allow the periphery to converge and will create political divergence towards extremists.”
我们还指出存在自其他国家输入中国装配平台的原料所引起的供应链扭曲现象，一旦把这种统计手法纠正过来将会令美中贸易失衡数字减少35~40 ％ ， 但应者寥寥。	Nor does it matter when we point out that correcting for supply-chain distortions – caused by inputs from other countries that enter into Chinese assembly platforms – would reduce the bilateral US-China trade imbalance by 35-40%.
但EEAS最终在与欧盟委员会的扯皮中无疾而终，而即将卸任的高级代表凯瑟琳·阿什顿（Catherine Ashton）也没能缓和这一紧张局面，因为她自己也不愿卷入欧盟内部的纠纷中。	But the EEAS ended up in a turf war with the European Commission, and outgoing High Representative Catherine Ashton did little to ease the tension, owing to her unwillingness to involve herself in intra-EU disagreements.
通过将公司税率降低到具备全球竞争力的水平并给予更好的利润归国条件，该税收计划有望将企业收益转移回美国。	By lowering the corporate-tax rate to a globally competitive level and granting better terms for repatriating profits, the tax package is expected to shift corporate earnings back to the United States.
但是，在2009年的哥本哈根会议上，承诺形成全球协定的气候谈判各方食言了，因此，2015年12月的巴黎峰会几乎也必将沦为又一场灾难。	But, with climate negotiators promising to deliver the global agreement that they could not deliver in Copenhagen in 2009, the December 2015 summit in Paris is almost certain to be another debacle.
随着社会保障系统和主权基金这样的公有实体持有更加多样化的资产组合，也就会大大减少偏袒国家持有较多份额的已有企业的市场干涉行为。	With public entities like the social security system and sovereign-wealth funds holding more diversified asset portfolios, incentives would be substantially reduced for market intervention favoring incumbents in which the state owned a large share.
如果这一趋势在未来几个月中保持下去，家庭很快就会认识到他们的生活水平正在下降，从而必须调整支出习惯。	As this trend continues in the coming months, households will soon realize that their living standards are falling, and they will have to adjust their spending habits.
比如，斯里兰卡MAS控股集团（MAS Holdings）在工作场所中嵌入了护士站、现场银行服务以及解决雇员上下班问题、方便他们参与体育活动的通勤巴士。	For example, MAS Holdings in Sri Lanka has incorporated into the workplace nursing stations, on-site banking, and company buses that ease employees’ commutes and facilitate participation in sports programs.
第一种可能是第一部长萨尔蒙德（Alex Salmond）所构想的，即成立一个货币联盟，其中的央行同时对苏格兰和没有了苏格兰的英国负责。	The first possibility, which First Minister Alex Salmond appears to have in mind, would entail a monetary union under a central bank accountable both to Scotland and the rump UK.
欧洲央行行长让-克劳德·特里谢深知这一点：在1990年代初，时任法国央行行长的他就应对过类似的危机。	European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet is well aware of this: in the early 1990’s, he confronted such a crisis as Governor of the Bank of France.
针对每次重要发展而展开的讨论中，沃尔芬森都带领世界银行走在最先面，在抗击艾滋病及其它威胁贫困国家的重大疾病的战斗中他也始终走在最前面。	Wolfensohn led the World Bank onto the cutting edge of every important development debate, and was at the forefront of the effort to combat HIV/AIDS, as well as other deadly diseases that threaten so many impoverished countries.
他认为，美国民主的最大危险是多数人的暴政，美国式生活中令人窒息的思想顺从，令人压抑的少数派观点和异见。	The biggest danger to US democracy, he believed, was the tyranny of the majority, the suffocating intellectual conformity of American life, the stifling of minority opinion and dissent.
此外，这与美国长期以来的承诺 — — 坚持基于规则的货币体系，遏制竞争性货币贬值 — — 也背道而驰。	Moreover, it amounts to a betrayal of the longstanding US commitment to uphold a rules-based monetary system that discourages competitive currency devaluation.
曼哈顿和肯辛顿（Kensington）的晚宴派对上充斥着关于巴塞尔II的细节和顺周期资本要求的弊端的闲言碎语。	Dinner parties in Manhattan and Kensington were consumed with the finer points of Basel II and the evils of procyclical capital requirements.
但是，请记住修西底德（Thucydides）的忠告，它对避免错误解读分析家的现实理论十分重要，并且还将继续向政治领导人和公众指出这一点。	But, remembering Thucydides’ advice, it will be important not to mistake analysts’ theories for reality, and to continue pointing this out to political leaders and publics.
2009年时希腊预算赤字相当于GDP的15 ％ ； 参与国际货币基金组织项目后的2010年赤字有所下降，但仅跌至11 ％ 。	In 2009, the Greek budget deficit was 15% of GDP; with an IMF program, the deficit fell in 2010, but only to 11% of GDP.
牛津—在关于新闻的未来的争论中 ， “ 假新闻”是中心议题，其特色内容是一位慷慨激昂的美国总统，俄罗斯通讯“机器人 ” ， 以及为了争夺公共注意力的背叛和花招。	OXFORD – In the debate over the future of journalism, “fake news” has taken center stage, with storylines featuring a ranting American president, Russian communication “bots,” and betrayal and subterfuge competing for public attention.
但最高法院在2010年所做出的争议性裁决《公民联盟 》 （ Citizens United）使这一目标实现的难度大大增加。 该裁决认定，选战捐赠 — — 即使来自公司 — — 是受保护的言论自由的一种形式。	But the Supreme Court made achieving that much harder with its controversial Citizens United decision in 2010, when it held that campaign donations – even from corporations – are a protected form of free speech.
这个错误既不在他们2009年的获奖著作中，也不再后来被广泛传阅的、回应对他们工作的学术争论的论文中。	The error is in neither their prize-winning 2009 book nor in a subsequent widely read paper responding to the academic debate about their work.
2013年11月，克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）写道 ， “ 德国没能调整放大了紧缩成本 。 ”	In November 2013, Paul Krugman wrote that, “Germany’s failure to adjust magnified the cost of austerity.”
台湾唯一的原住民国会议员曾经对陈水扁和民进党进行了一次逻辑上的驳斥，此人在一次国会会议上专门用自己的方言发表了一通演讲，结果没有一个与会议员听得懂。	Taiwan ’s sole aboriginal parliamentarian once provided the logical rebuttal to Chen and the DPP, delivering a speech to a packed Congress entirely in his native tongue, which nobody else in the chamber could understand.
美国当然希望巴基斯坦能消灭阿富汗和巴基斯坦的塔利班领袖，但绝不会过多依靠巴基斯坦统治者来实现这一目标。	The US would certainly like Pakistan to eliminate the leadership of the Taliban, both Afghan and Pakistani, but will not lean too heavily on Pakistan’s rulers to accomplish this goal.
在其他国家，政策制定者们在多年以前就为银行业现代化制定了路线图并从那时开始就强化了竞争—这对于顾客和银行都是有益的。	In other countries, policymakers set the course for banking modernization years ago and have reinforced competition since then – to the benefit of customers and banks alike.
看到成千上万的人参与这场辩论是一个振奋人心的事情，因为如果没有大众的参与，安全就是难以界定的问题，而那些迫在眉睫的重要改革也会缺乏政治合法性。	It is encouraging to see that many thousands are indeed getting involved, because without popular engagement, security will remain undefined, and the important reforms that are needed will lack political legitimacy.
自2003年以来，东非地区记录了8个最温暖年份，毫无疑问，这与困扰非洲之角1300万人的大饥荒密切相关。	Since 2003, East Africa has had the eight warmest years on record, which is no doubt contributing to the severe famine that now afflicts 13 million people in the Horn of Africa.
这种无声无息的对和平的推动一直是欧洲经济进一步一体化的主要动力，而欧洲经济一体化被看作是达到政治一体化的一种手段。	This drive for peace remained, quietly, the key motivation behind further steps toward Europe’s economic integration, which was regarded as the vehicle for achieving political integration.
他还强调可再生能源开发和节能技术创新，在两年前福岛第一核电站事故爆发后，这已经成为紧迫的政策目标之一。	He is also emphasizing the development of renewable energy and power-saving innovations, which became an urgent policy objective following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant two years ago.
因此，逆转使用欧元的第一个十年中所出现的单位劳动成本巨大差异不仅要求在南欧实行��资限制和生产率强化改革，还要求北欧提高工资。	Reversing the large differential in unit labor costs that has emerged in the euro’s first decade thus requires not only wage restraint and productivity-enhancing reforms in the south, but also higher wage gains in the north.
这有助于防止政府对公私合作项目的担保给预算带来大于或等于GDP的1%的成本，哥伦比亚、印度尼西亚和葡萄牙都超过了这一标准。	This will help to prevent government guarantees for public-private partnerships from imposing budgetary costs equivalent to one or more points of GDP, as has happened in Colombia, Indonesia, and Portugal.
但是，由于候选人需要受到由亲中派担任委员的非选举产生的委员会的仔细审查，实际上公民可以说完全没有选择。	But, given that candidates are to be carefully vetted by an unelected committee of pro-Chinese appointees, citizens would have no meaningful choice at all.
尽管如此，人们当时仍然就遵守游戏规则达成了默契 — — 具体而言就是遵守世贸组织规则 — — 而美国最终也做到了。	Still, there was an implicit understanding that everybody would abide by the rules of the game – specifically, the rules of the World Trade Organization – and the US ultimately did.
此外，由于煤电和天然气电电厂动辄持续50年或以上，这些投资要么将导致排放量达不到气候目标要求，要么导致重大资产减记。	And, because coal- and gas-fired power stations last 50 years or more, such investments raise the risk of either locking in emission levels incompatible with the climate target, or forcing major asset write-offs.
但大部分工人并未参与到这些计划中，而最大的受益者则是CEO和高层管理者，他们的收入大头与生产率挂钩，反映在利润和股票表现中。	But most workers are not covered by such plans, and the biggest beneficiaries have been CEOs and top managers, a significant fraction of whose pay is tied to productivity, as reflected in profits and stock performance.
而且，空袭虽然可能会将伊朗的核计划推迟几年，但也会促使民族主义者团结起来支持政府和核计划，特别是在一次打击不够的情况下。	Moreover, while an air strike might set back Iran’s program by a few years, it would solidify nationalist support for the government and the nuclear program, particularly because one attack would not be enough.
第二次世界大战后，凯恩斯所担忧的问题逐渐淡化为背景，因为复兴的西方繁荣让许多人相信这些问题已经永久得到了解决。	After World War II, the problems that concerned Keynes faded into the background, as renewed prosperity in the West led many to believe that they had been permanently solved.
他们通过煽动对“他人 ” — —包括难民、穆斯林或外国恐怖分子 — — 的恐惧并承诺以武力确保安全来攫取权力。	They win power by stoking fear of the “other” – refugees, Muslims, or foreign terrorists – and promising to establish security through force.
因此，普金所谓的与日本就北方四岛达成协议完全是个谎言，一如他宣称克里米亚的俄罗斯族面临着危险因此需要派遣俄罗斯军队予以保护。	So Putin’s talk about reaching an agreement with Japan on the Northern Territories was likely as mendacious as his claims that Russians in Crimea were in peril, and thus in need of protection by Russian troops.
国际清算银行（中央银行的中央银行）的史蒂芬·赛切蒂（Stephen G. Cecchetti）和恩尼塞·卡罗比（Enisse Kharroubi）更进一步，他们指出金融部门的高增长抑制了其他部门的生产率增长。	Stephen G. Cecchetti and Enisse Kharroubi of the Bank for International Settlements – the central banks’ central bank – go further. They argue that rapid financial-sector growth reduces productivity growth in other sectors.
如果政策制定者忽视特定地区或部门的损失，那么后果就是民众的愤怒和社会分化 — — 并对经济的运行轨迹持消极态度。	When policymakers ignore losses in particular regions or sectors, the result is anger and social division – and negative views about the economy’s trajectory.
对许多韩国年轻人来说，拜住房成本和年轻人失业率等因素所赐，如今连结婚也未必结得起，即使是大学毕业生也是如此。	For many young South Koreans, even marriage is economically unfeasible nowadays, owing to factors like high housing costs and youth unemployment, even among university graduates.
Urlanis的观点是 — — 比起女人，男人才是更为敏感的生物 — — 这个观点在当今家庭生活质量恶化、一半婚姻以离婚收场、没有父亲的孩子数量不断上升至历史最高纪录的情况下，甚至更为贴切。	Urlanis’s argument – that men, not women, are the more delicate creatures – is even more relevant now, with family life decaying, half of marriages ending in divorce, and the number of fatherless children rising to record levels.
为了延缓抗药性的蔓延，争取足够的时间让新药投入生产，必须实现一个紧迫的短期目标：阻止抗药性占领南亚和东南亚并向其他地区蔓延。	In order to delay the spread of resistance long enough to allow new drugs to come onstream, an urgent short-term objective must be achieved: preventing resistance from taking hold in South and Southeast Asia and spreading elsewhere.
我们花了许多年 — — 合理的估算是从1992年里约地球峰会以来经过了整整一代人的努力 — — 才达成了巴黎气候协定，并在2015年12月获得了联合国所有193个成员国的一致通过。	It had taken many years – by one plausible accounting a full generation since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit – to reach the Paris climate agreement, unanimously adopted by all 193 UN member states in December 2015.
英国独立党（UK Independence Party）党员甚至认为英国可以做得更好，许多保守党中的“欧洲怀疑派”也作如是观。	Members of the UK Independence Party even think that Britain would do better, as do a considerable number of Conservative “Euro-skeptics.”
但是，尽管一些久负盛名的报纸 — — 如《纽约时报 》 、 《华盛顿邮报》和英国的《卫报 》 — —的网络版表现出色，并不足以扭转颓势。	Yet, while some well-known newspapers – such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the United Kingdom-based Guardian – have developed a robust Internet presence themselves, it is not enough.
要理解个中原因，可以回顾2014年10月欧洲银行局（European Banking Authority，EBA）对欧元区123家大银行所做的资产负债表压力测试，该测试发现所有银行存在250亿欧元的资本短缺。	To understand why, we should look back to October 2014, when the European Banking Authority began balance-sheet stress tests for the eurozone’s largest 123 banks and found a capital shortfall of €25 billion ($28 billion) in all of them.
不过这一同盟以及与中国的关系现在又出现了一个新问题。 今年中国超越美国成为世界上最大的温室气体排放国。	There is a new dimension to the alliance, however, and to the relationship with China. This year, China surpassed the US as the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
如果政策制定者在抑制通胀的正面性供应冲击的暂时性判断上出现了失误，那么政策正常化可能是错误的做法，而非常规政策应维持更长时间。	If policymakers are incorrect in assuming that the positive supply shocks holding down inflation are temporary, policy normalization may be the wrong approach, and unconventional policies should be sustained for longer.
同理，它们还稀释了“改善的下水道”的目标。 这一目标的本意是收集、处理和安全排放废水，而国际组织的方针是改善居民家中的厕所。	In the same way, they have diluted the goal of “improved sanitation” – the process of collecting, treating, and safely discharging wastewater – by applying it to indoor toilets in people’s homes.
比如，去年解放军在拉达克（Ladakh）的德普桑（Depsang）峡谷临时扎营，导致了与印度的紧张对峙。	For example, last year, Chinese troops established a temporary camp in Ladakh’s Depsang valley, leading to a high-stakes standoff with India.
可以肯定的是，价格歧视不会发生在每件商品和服务上，而这种趋势可能会受到线下零售商或新进入者通过向每个人提供更低价格争夺市场份额的竞争冲击。	To be sure, price discrimination will not happen for every good and service, and the trend could be tempered by competition from offline retailers or new entrants vying for market share by offering lower prices to everyone.
1945年岸信介以战犯身份被美国人囚禁，冷战开始后未经审判即被释放，并于1957年以保守党身份当选首相。	Imprisoned by the Americans as a war criminal in 1945, Kishi was released without trial at the beginning of the Cold War, and was elected Prime Minister as a conservative in 1957.
3月份，英国、德国、韩国、澳大利亚和其他国家出人意料地决定加入亚投行，这让很多媒体将此报道为（部分拜美国决策者的失策所赐）美国盟友集体投敌。	When the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, Australia, and others unexpectedly decided in March to join the AIIB, it was widely reported (partly because of missteps by US policymakers) as a mass defection of US allies to a rival’s party.
双方都必须致力于通过各种谈判机制增加互相理解与信任，鼓励“第二轨道外交 ” （ 规模较小的非国家行为人之间的互动 ） 。	Both sides must work to increase mutual understanding and trust through various negotiation mechanisms and to encourage “track II diplomacy” (interactions among smaller non-state actors).
普京也与中国国家主席习近平建立了良好的工作关系，这一关系的基础是共同的国内不自由以及对制衡美国意识形态和影响的渴望。	And Putin has struck up a good working relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, based on their shared domestic illiberalism and desire to counter American ideology and influence.
首先，欧元区危机正在恶化，由于欧元维持强势，前瞻性财政紧缩将会深化多个成员国的衰退，而外围国信贷动荡和高油价又阻挠了复苏前景。	For starters, the eurozone crisis is worsening, as the euro remains too strong, front-loaded fiscal austerity deepens recession in many member countries, and a credit crunch in the periphery and high oil prices undermine prospects of recovery.
作为总统，肯尼迪的和平观并不新鲜，但他在和平观的指导下谈判了第一个和武器控制协定 — — 《部分禁止核试验条约 》 （ Limited Test Ban Treaty ） 。	While a presidential vision of peace was not new, Kennedy followed it up by negotiating the first nuclear arms-control agreement, the Limited Test Ban Treaty.
只有制定一个长期的战略，东道国政府才能确保中国（和其他地区）的投资行为是一个发展的工具，而不只是一种获得短期利润的手段。	Only with a long-term strategy can host governments ensure that Chinese (and other) investments become a tool of development, not just a means of generating short-term profit.
纽约 — — 2011年，一系列小概率大事件冲击了全球经济，尽管如此，金融市场持续上行，直至一个月前为止。	NEW YORK – Despite the series of low-probability, high-impact events that have hit the global economy in 2011, financial markets continued to rise happily until a month or so ago.
巴西需要新的增长模式，该模式有四大基础要素：更紧的财政政策、更松的货币政策、降低国有银行在信用供给中的作用，以及降低巴西畸高的私人贷款成本的措施。	Brazil needs a new growth model, based on four key elements: tighter fiscal policy, looser monetary policy, a reduced role for state-owned banks in credit provision, and measures to lower Brazil’s astronomical private lending costs.
2010年量化宽松开始时，消费物价指数上涨1.6 % ， 2011年和2012年有所增加，2013年（资产购买高峰之年）回落至1.5 % 。	The consumer price index rose by 1.6% in 2010, when quantitative easing began, then increased somewhat faster in 2011 and 2012, before dropping back to a gain of just 1.5% in 2013, the peak year for asset purchases.
大多数会采用更加先进的税收制度，例如为降低低收入劳动者的有效边际税率 — — 就是美国总统奥巴马所提出的 “让工作真正挣钱 ” 。	Most would make the tax system more progressive, by, for example, lowering the effective marginal tax rate for low-income workers – what US President Barack Obama has called “making work pay.”
通过建立地区性，全国性甚至全球性的就业市场，平台令雇主可以在更大型的人才库中甄选英才，也让求职者能去检索数量更加庞大的就业机会。	By creating regional, national, and even global job markets, they allow employers to tap into broader talent pools and connect job seekers with a wider universe of opportunities.
于是，核军备竞赛开始了。 1960年，美国总统肯尼迪警告说，到20世纪60年代中期将由15、20乃至25个有核国家。	So the nuclear arms race began, and in 1960 President John F. Kennedy warned that there would be 15, 20, or 25 nuclear states by the mid-1960s.
毕竟，权衡直面不相关的外部暴力势力的利弊是一回事；猛烈打击带政治目的的、令人不快的野蛮影像的炮制者是另一回事。	After all, it is one thing to deliberate on the pros and cons of confronting external forces of irrational violence; it is something else to lash out against the producers of brutal, politically charged, and upsetting imagery.
目前，美国政治中的一些最保守元素 — — 他们的后台是亿万富翁大卫和查尔斯·科奇（David and Charles Koch）兄弟，在气候变化问题上无动于衷对他们最有利 — — 正在试图抹黑方济各的观点。	Already, some of the most conservative elements in American politics – backed by those, like the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, who benefit from inaction on climate change – are attempting to denounce Francis’s views.
但如果移民治理不负责任、缺少合作，这些好处就很容易被挥霍浪费，我们在地中海、安达曼海、中美洲走廊、萨赫勒和非洲之角所看到的危机就是如此。	But these benefits are easily squandered if, as we’ve seen recently with crises in the Mediterranean Sea, the Andaman Sea, the Central American corridor, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa, migration is not governed responsibly and cooperatively.
人们常常忘记了这样一个事实，那就是美国国防部长拉姆斯菲尔德在经历了闲适的退休生活后又重新出山，本着上面提到的原则将美国军队改组为更小、也更灵活的作战团体。	It is often forgotten that US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emerged from a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American military into a smaller, more agile force, using some of these same insights.
你还可以想象一下如果没有这项发明增加的粮食产量，地球只能供养约50亿人口 — — 至少比今天的人口少20亿之多。	Or that without the added food made possible by their discovery, the earth could only support about 4 billion people – at least 2 billion less than today.
2005年，我们兰德公司的同事预测，如果医疗卫生业可以复制其他行业曾发生过的IT驱动生产率的过程，美国每年可以节约800亿美元。	In 2005, colleagues of ours at the RAND Corporation projected that America could save more than $80 billion a year if health care could replicate the IT-driven productivity gains observed in other industries.
个人需求差别很大，但是私人保险公司往往不愿投保那些最需要医疗服务的人群（例如那些已经生病的人，或可能会引发其他健康问题的糖尿病患者 ） 。	Individual needs vary significantly, and private companies are often unwilling to insure the very people who need the most care (such as those who are already ill, or who have conditions like diabetes, which predispose them to other health problems).
我们完全知道如何预防和治疗结核病，投资于消灭结核病也能带来巨大的经济收益，因此，没有理由继续因此承受沉重的生命损失。	Given all that we know about how to prevent and treat TB, and a powerful economic case for investing in eradication efforts, there is no excuse for the heavy toll that it continues to take.
具体来讲，在危机爆发前几年，金融放松管制和对富人减税一直在推动政府赤字和债务不断上升，同时也进一步加剧了不平等。	Specifically, in the years before the crisis, financial deregulation and tax cuts for the rich had been driving government deficits and debt ever higher, while further increasing inequality.
目前的情况是，反欧盟政党热烈地响应俄罗斯总统普京及其相当反自由的经济和社会政策，这也许是唯一有利于老牌政治家庭的动向。	As it stands, the anti-EU parties’ enthusiastic embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with his profoundly anti-liberal economic and social policies, may well be the only thing working in the established political families’ favor.
3-5年后电池寿命终结导致很多住宅供电系��无法继续使用，大大影响了那些本以为可以终身供电的房主对于系统的信心。	Many residential systems break down after 3-5 years when the battery dies, undermining confidence in the system among owners who assumed that they had a lifetime supply of energy.
但在结束也门战争 — — 相较叙利亚战争，也门战争处于较早阶段，并且牵涉到的国际和地区利益也较少 — — 方面是有可能取得进展的，特别是如果考虑到沙特阿拉伯经济困难的话。	But progress toward ending the war in Yemen – which is at an earlier stage than the Syrian war, and entails fewer international and regional interests – is possible, especially given Saudi Arabia’s economic travails.
显然，参与资本外逃的艺术投资者，或者希望隐身或洗钱的艺术品投资者，他们的激励和动机与普通投资者大相径庭。	Clearly, the incentives and motives of art investors who are engaged in capital flight, or who want to hide or launder their money, are quite different from those of ordinary investors.
如今，债务让发达国家难以回归2008年前的增长率，更不用说重塑大衰退不发生情况下GDP所能达到的水平了。	Today, debt is making it difficult for developed countries to resume pre-2008 growth rates, let alone restore the levels of GDP that would have been attained if the subsequent Great Recession had not happened.
中国在斯里兰卡一帆风顺，直到2015年拉贾帕克萨出人意料地在选举中败给了西里塞纳，后者的竞选承诺是让斯里兰卡摆脱中国债务陷阱。	It was smooth sailing for China, until Rajapaksa was unexpectedly defeated in the early 2015 election by Maithripala Sirisena, who had campaigned on the promise to extricate Sri Lanka from the Chinese debt trap.
在多数后共产主义国家腐败指数下降的大背景下，在普京接替叶利钦出任总统后，俄国的所有腐败指数在过去几年内都有了大幅度提升，这一点丝毫也不值得大惊小怪。	Not surprisingly, all corruption indicators have been rising since Putin took over from Yeltsin, whereas they are falling in most post-communist countries.
但德国年轻人对大屠杀的记忆已经日渐模糊，再加上以色列国际形象的破坏，这些构成了两国“特殊”关系的官方定性的挑战。	But fading memories of the Holocaust among younger Germans, together with Israel’s declining international standing, have lately challenged the official discourse about “special” ties between the two countries.
多亏紧急行动中心的设立，这些基础设施甚至通过追踪和监控接触者，协助阻止了2014年尼日利亚埃博拉疫情的爆发。	Thanks to the emergency operations centers, this infrastructure even helped to stop the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria in 2014, by enabling contact tracing and surveillance.
两人都以同样无法效仿的方式显示了其乖张的个性，这种个性在知识分子圈子里极富争议，人们对之可以说是非爱即恨：阿隆提倡英美式的自由主义，在其成为一种时尚之前；萨特在共产主义浪潮在法国过去之后继续保持着共产主义同情者的身份。	Each in his inimitable way displayed the contrariness both loved and loathed in intellectuals: Aron fancied Anglo-American liberalism before it became fashionable, while Sartre remained a Communist sympathiser after the fashion had passed.
美国的联邦基金利率实际为零，而欧洲央行的主要再贷款利率虽然一直以来已经低到2 % ， 还是可能在以后的几个月中降得更低。	The Federal funds rate in the US is practically zero, and the European Central Bank’s main refinancing rate, already at an all-time low of 2%, will likely fall further in the coming months.
尽管中国日益增长的金融实力可能会让其更有能力回拒美国的乞求，尽管有那些可怕的预测，但是中国作为债权人的角色不足以逼迫美国改变它的政策。	China’s increased financial power may have increased its ability to resist American entreaties, but despite dire predictions, its creditor role has not been sufficient to compel the US to change its policies.
随着全球化所带来的好处越来越明显，自给自足政策所造成的损害也不言而喻，东方国家的决策者开始明白自己反对全球化的立场是一个错误。	As the benefits of globalization became manifest, and the damage wrought by autarkic policies also became evident, policymakers in the East began to appreciate that their anti-globalization stance had been a mistake.
伦敦—我已经有四年多没有关注国际金融和经济预测了，但在我在这一领域全职工作的30多年里所学到的经验仍在影响我看待世界的方式。	LONDON – I have been out of the world of international finance and economic forecasting for more than four years, but much of what I learned during my 30 years working full-time in the field still influences how I view the world.
必须坚决捍��公众言论及和平集会的权利，这既是为了那些自觉被主流社会边缘化的团体，也是为了那些对巴勒斯坦、车臣和伊拉克民众所遭受的不公正待遇而义愤填膺的全体民众和大多数欧洲公民。	The right to public speech and peaceful assembly must be defended for those who feel marginalized and indignant at what they – and most Europeans – view as injustices committed against the Palestinians, the Chechens, and the Iraqis.
欧洲的竞争法尤其允许政策制定者随意干涉，从而增加了不确定性，破坏了财富的创造并且损害了消费者的利益。	European competition law in particular allows policymakers to intervene at will, increasing uncertainty, damaging wealth creation and consumer well-being.
前提很明确：由于危机的影响比从前都更为显著，各国之间的互相依存已经成为无法回避的事实，况且也没有另外一条道路可供选择。	The premise is clear: as the crisis made more evident than ever, the interdependence of countries is inescapable. In the face of today’s global challenges, the only possible response must be global.
看来，引入“人类世”的概念来描述现在的人类主宰的时代比较合适，作为一个地质时代，它是“全新世”的下一代。	It seems appropriate to assign the term “Anthropocene” to the current, in many ways human-dominated, geological epoch, supplementing the Holocene – the warm period of the past 10–12 millennia.
但在过去的几年中，一些国家越来越多的让外国人和具有国外经验的人来担任通常被国家视为第二最重要的位置：中央银行首脑。	But, during the last few years, countries have increasingly turned to foreigners and people with considerable foreign experience to assume what is generally viewed as a country’s second most important position: head of the central bank.
这意味着从2010年伊始就开始上调基准政策利率13倍以应对依然严重的通胀局面的印度储备银行很难切实放松货币政策。	That means that the Reserve Bank of India – which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still-serious inflation problem – can ill afford to ease monetary policy.
去年秋天，在美国商务部认定中国向美国市场“倾销 ” （ 一般定义为以低于成本价销售）罪名成立后，美国对从中国进口的太阳能电池板征收24－36%的关税。	Last fall, the US introduced tariffs of 24-36% against Chinese solar-panel imports, after the Commerce Department determined that China had been “dumping” – which is generally defined as selling at a price below cost – into the American market.
发自北京 — — 从去年十一月以来，经济学家和媒体都都在为供应侧结构改革大唱赞歌，视之为破除中国经济困境的开创性解决方案。	BEIJING – Since last November, economists and the media alike have been hailing supply-side structural reform as a groundbreaking solution to China’s economic woes.
他的宗派主义独裁行为导致了埃及的极化，以至于以同情伊斯兰教著称的军队首脑西西（Abdul Fattah al-Sisi）将军也不再支持任命了他的穆尔西。	His sectarian, authoritarian behavior polarized his country to such a degree that even the army’s chief, General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, known for his Islamist sympathies, withdrew his support from the man who had appointed him.
自1800年以来，全球经济已经经历了多次这样的周期，在任意一年，独立国家经历重组的比例在零和50%之间波动（见图 ） 。	Since 1800, the global economy has endured several such cycles, with the share of independent countries undergoing restructuring during any given year oscillating between zero and 50% (see figure).
预期的市场回报率是这一数值加上或减去预期的估值比变化：股票收益会随着市盈率提升而增加，抑或随着市盈率降低而减少？	The expected market return is that amount plus or minus expected changes in valuation ratios: will stocks return more as price-earnings ratios rise, or return less as price-earnings ratios fall?
但是美国最高法院一再裁定州不能抵消或违反联邦法律 — — 南部一些州在20世纪中叶抵制学校种族融合时曾要求享有这类权利。	But the US Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that states may not nullify or contravene federal law – a right some southern states claimed in the mid-twentieth century to resist school integration.
我猜想，美国政府没有做到它应该做的一切的原因能以三个字来描述：参议员约翰·沃诺维奇，他是参议院的第60投票，这个投票是结束辩论并通过一项法案的必须的投票。	My guess is that the reason that the US government is not doing all it should can be stated in three words: Senator George Voinovich, who is the 60th vote in the Senate – the vote needed to close off debate and enact a bill.
我想说的是，坏经济学让坏政治学更有可能从边缘走入主流，就像1928—1930年间的德国民族社会主义。	What I will say is that bad economics makes it more likely that bad politics will move from the fringes into the mainstream, as German National Socialism did between 1928 and 1930.
实际上，今日中东地区的内部动态主要由三个国家推动，其中哪一个都不是阿拉伯国家： 这三个国家是以色列、伊朗，而且土耳其的影响越来越大。	Indeed, intra-regional dynamics in the Middle East today are driven by three states, none of which is Arab: Israel, Iran, and, increasingly, Turkey.
希望的曙光也已经闪现。 在刚刚结束的法 — 德领导人会议之后，德国总理默克尔没有公开反对建立欧盟经济政府的理念，这可是破天荒头一遭。	One sign of hope is that, following the recent Franco-German summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time did not publicly oppose the idea of a European economic government.
通常，默认现象对绝大多数人来说是可持续的 — — 比如，它通常会将所有储蓄都配置给低回报货币市场基金。	Often, the default option is unsuitable for most individuals – for instance, it typically allocates all savings to low-return money-market funds.
未来运动员将进行基因改造的前景引发了体育界的恐慌，随之而来的是把这些运动员视作非人类或某种形式的突变异种。	The prospect of a future of genetically modified athletes incites alarm throughout the sports world, accompanied by portrayals of such athletes as inhuman or some form of mutant.
我们致力于营造一种环境，让农村贫困男女可以种植和出售更多的粮食，增加他们的收入并决定自己生活的方向。	We work to create conditions in which poor rural women and men can grow and sell more food, increase their incomes, and determine the direction of their own lives.
它反映了国会共和党领导层的意愿，包括22名一周前致信特朗普的共和党参议员，他们在信中要求他退出巴黎协定。	It reflected the will of the Republican leadership in Congress, including the 22 Republican senators who sent Trump a letter the week before, calling on him to withdraw from the Paris accord.
几年前，美国降低了资本收入的联邦税，并逐步取消了房地产遗产税，这只能让最顶层1%获益 — — 被广泛视为富人炫耀政治权力。	A few years ago, the US reduced federal taxes on capital income and phased out the estate tax, benefiting only the upper 1% – moves widely viewed as demonstrating the political power of the rich.
首先，由于基因组通过复制大量增长和传播，修改全部基因组只需要修改有限数量的个体，特别是对于生命周期较短的生命体而言。	For starters, because genomes multiply and spread with reproduction, modifying an entire population would require modifications to only a limited number of individuals, especially if the organism’s lifecycle is short.
事实上，我最近遇到的一位年轻的北京创业家估计，现在至少有20%的中国人 — — 超过2.5亿人 — — 每年的收入超过40,000美元。	In fact, a young Beijing-based entrepreneur I met recently estimates that at least 20% of Chinese – over 250 million people – are now making $40,000 per year.
特别是要专门针对俄罗斯去制定一个更为成熟严密的政策：比如说当我们对俄罗斯试图重建前苏联“利益圈”和“防御区”的政策感到不满时，中欧人就应该把自己定义为俄罗斯人的对手。	For example, we Central Europeans are opponents when we do not accept Russia’s policy of renewing “spheres of interest” and “security zones.”
其次，央行可以在量化和信贷宽松的同时，回归负利率，欧洲央行、日本银行、瑞士国民银行和其他一些央行在最近几年中就是这么做的。	Second, central banks could return to negative policy rates, as the ECB, BOJ, SNB, and some other central banks have done, in addition to quantitative and credit easing, in recent years.
但奥巴马无法独自完成这一点 — — 而如今，美国公众和美国国会似乎都没有依照道德指南针所知的方向前进。	But Obama cannot do it alone – and, so far, neither the American public nor the US Congress seems committed to reconnecting with its moral compass.
法国欧盟宪法草案全民公决前的运动中，欧盟建议的有关服务业的指令被诬蔑为破坏劳动者权利，而这一指控通过“波兰管道工”吓人的形象体现出来。	During the referendum campaign in France preceding the vote on the draft EU Constitutional Treaty, the proposed directive was vilified as undermining the rights of labor, symbolized by that dreaded bogeyman, the “Polish plumber.”
相反，金融投资者对中央银行的坚定支撑能力极为信任，有信心货币当局最终会成功地将政策诱导性增长转化为真正的增长。	Instead, financial investors have trusted in the steadfast support of central banks, confident that the monetary authorities will eventually succeed in transforming policy-induced growth into genuine growth.
事实上，当联���存款保险公司和英格兰银行研究其计划之时，美联储正在研究一种在美外资银行处于比当前更牢固掌控和严密监管之下的提案。	Indeed, while the FDIC and the BoE were working on their plan, the US Federal Reserve was developing proposals that will expose overseas banks in the US to a far tighter set of controls, and closer supervision, than they have hitherto experienced.
但在私有部门专业人士被解雇或因业绩不佳而遭降薪的时候，任却希望拿到私有部门的薪酬，而不承担私有部门的风险。	But, whereas private-sector professionals are fired or have their salaries reduced for poor performance, Yam wanted private-sector pay with none of the downside risk.
金融分析师对于GDP增长是否会降到7%以下十分紧张，试图在官方陈述中挖掘政府是否会采取行动的蛛丝马迹。	Financial analysts are in a tizzy over whether GDP growth will fall below 7%, parsing official statements for clues as to whether and when the government will act.
长期以来，悲观论者总是把中国经济与本国经济作比较 — — 重复着耶鲁大学历史学家史景迁（Jonathan Spence）的著名观点在多年前就发出警告的典型错误。	Pessimists have long viewed the Chinese economy as they view their own economies – repeating a classic mistake that Yale historian Jonathan Spence’s seminal assessment warned of many years ago.
但过于轻易地呼喊种族灭绝迅速贬低了这个词的价值，并将对持续灭绝采取对策的努力限制在对法律性质的纯粹辩论中。	Yet crying genocide too liberally quickly cheapens its value, entangling efforts to respond to ongoing exterminations in debates about their precise legal nature.
法国支持欧元成员资格，因为他们希望包括自己在内的地中海国家能够在资本市场上以与德国相同的低利率实现借贷。	The French supported euro membership, because they wanted the Mediterranean countries, including themselves, to be able to borrow at the same low rates as Germany on the capital markets.
再加上中国、阿拉伯国家和拉美国家以投资和贷款形式投入的大笔支出，流向发展中国家的官方发展援助显然已经达到史无前例的金额。	Add to this total the substantial spending by China, Arab states, and Latin American countries in the form of investments and loans, and it is clear that flows of ODA toward the developing world have reached unprecedented levels.
政府缺少财政空间，希腊银行背上了沉重的不良贷款负担，因此，动员希腊剩余资产、打通银行信用流向私人部门的健康部分的渠道十分重要。	With the government lacking fiscal room, and Greek banks burdened by non-performing loans, it is important to mobilize the state’s remaining assets and unclog the flow of bank credit to healthy parts of the private sector.
气候行动应该被视为改善世界最贫困人群的办法 — — 他们是最需要协定的人群 — — 而不是成为他们的负担。	Climate action should be viewed as a means to improve the well-being of the world’s poorest people – those who most need an agreement – rather than as a burden.
比如，不但升级了其对日本对尖阁列岛（钓鱼岛）几十年控制权的挑战，还从去年控制黄岩岛开始于菲律宾针锋相对。	For example, China has not only escalated its challenge to Japan’s decades-old control of the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands, but is also facing off against the Philippines since taking effective control of Scarborough Shoal last year.
“我们正在切身感受到气候变化急剧扩大的影响 ， ” 印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪在谈到钦奈洪灾时说，并呼吁工业化国家采取更多措施缓解全球变暖的影响。	“We are feeling climate change’s fast-growing impact now,” said India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pointing to Chennai and calling upon industrialized countries to do more to mitigate global warming.
2008年一项研究发现，一个国家的教育体系质量 — — 以及毕业生的认知能力 — — 与其经济增长是高度正相关的。	One study from 2008 found that the quality of a country’s education system – and the cognitive abilities of its graduates – positively influences economic growth.
当韩国这样的东亚国家通过这类政策来让特定行业进行全球范围竞争时，拉丁美洲和加勒比国家却几乎没有走对过路子。	While East Asian countries like South Korea used such policies to enable selected industries to compete on a global scale, Latin American and Caribbean countries rarely got it right.
此外，工资增长的停滞意味着通货膨胀不会达到美联储的目标率，而这又意味着美联储将不得不以慢于预期的速度实现利率正常化。	Moreover, sluggish wage growth implies that inflation is not reaching the US Federal Reserve’s target rate, which means that the Fed will have to normalize interest rates more slowly than expected.
然而时至今日，根据拉美研究学者迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen）的研究判断 ， “ 阿根廷社会的大多数人都是贝隆主义者 … … 贝隆创造了一个目前中产阶级享受的福利国家 。 ”	Yet today, according to the Latin America scholar Michael Cohen, “most of Argentine society is Perónist….Perón delivered a welfare state from which the current middle class benefits.”
全球经济在政治和经济动荡中的复苏表明改革过程的核心实用性 - - 并且说明继续沿着这条道路走下去的重要性。	The resilience of the global economy in the face of political and economic shocks demonstrates the central relevance of the reform process - and underlines the importance of continuing along this path.
互联网的创造者 — — 他们属于一个封闭的小圈子 — — 对安全并非主要顾虑的开放系统感到十分满意。	The Internet’s creators, part of a small, enclosed community, were very comfortable with an open system in which security was not a primary concern.
我们走出这个监狱后的唯一希望是，有另一个国家决定为像我们这样的人 — — 我们这些没有做错任何事情，一开始就不应该被关押在这里的人 — — 提供安全的栖身之地。	Our only hope of getting out of this prison is that another country decides to provide safe haven to men like us – men who did nothing wrong and never should have been detained here in the first place.
此外，乌克兰在1994年交出核武器时，美国（英国、法国和俄国）当时都明确表态将保障乌克兰的领土完整。	Moreover, when Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons in 1994, it did so with the express understanding that the US (and the United Kingdom, France, and Russia) would guarantee its territorial integrity.
（从理论上讲，在劳动力丰富的中国和印度，资本家可能成为输家。 但在现实中，由于其政府成功的同步自由化和全球化，他们也受益匪浅。	(In theory, capitalists in labor-abundant China and India could end up as losers, but in practice they, too, have benefited thanks to their governments’ success in simultaneously liberalizing and globalizing.)
并且事实上，在新生欧洲经济共同体内部开放国界的1957年罗马条约促使欧洲内部贸易迅速扩大，从而促成了经济的共同复苏。	And, indeed, the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which opened national borders within the new European Economic Community, enabled the rapid proliferation of intra-European trade, thereby contributing to a shared economic recovery.
页岩气燃烧时还会释放二氧化碳，尽管页岩气比煤炭的含碳量低一半，并且对美国将碳排放量减至20世纪90年代中期水平居功至伟。	And shale gas emits CO2 when burned, even though it has half the carbon content of coal and has played a significant role in cutting US carbon emissions to mid-1990’s levels.
为公平以及效率起见，权利和利益不应取决于公司或就业状况，而是要与个人挂钩，同时应该可以在所有行业和岗位之间自由转移。	For fairness as well as for efficiency reasons, rights and benefits should be attached to individuals, not to companies or employment status, and should be fully portable across sectors and jobs.
政策制定者们应当抛弃繁杂的碳减排谈判，取而代之的则是达成协定，共同投资研究和改进技术，使之达到一个可供有效利用的水平。	Policymakers should abandon fraught carbon-reduction negotiations, and instead make agreements to invest in research and development to get this technology to the level where it needs to be.
欧洲人认为，美国在伊拉克的军事冒险首先提高了石油价格，所以就应当用能源税来平抑油价。 人们可以原谅他们这样的想法。	Europeans might be forgiven for thinking that the Americans, who pumped up oil prices in the first place with their military misadventure in Iraq, should be the ones who “pump it down” with an energy tax.
国际食物政策研究所（International Food Policy Research Institute）的刁新生（Xinshen Diao）指出，这一增长受不可贸易的服务部门的拉动，特别是建筑业、运输业和餐饮饭店业。	Xinshen Diao of the International Food Policy Research Institute has shown that this growth was led by non-tradable services, in particular construction, transport, and hotels and restaurants.
低利率还会鼓励正在做投资的企业将钱投给固定资本，比如高度自动化的机器，这意味着即使经济复苏，失业率也会相对较高。	And low interest rates will encourage firms that do invest to spend on fixed capital like highly automated machines, thereby ensuring that, when recovery comes, it will be relatively jobless.
此外，尽管数据不足，但MENA贫困率早已是发展中国家中最低的，而一些阿拉伯之春席卷的国家 — — 主要是突尼斯 — — 的贫困率在继续下降。	Moreover, despite the paucity of data, poverty ratios, already among the lowest in the developing world, were falling in some of the countries swept up by the Arab Spring – most notably, in Tunisia.
我个人还记得15年前日本公司净值比率低到什么程度 — — 不到20 % ， 而欧洲和美国为30 % 。	I, for one, remember how low the net-worth ratio for Japanese corporations was 15 years ago – below 20%, compared to more than 30% in Europe and the US.
他的信条代表了产业和金融过度繁荣时期的哲学，那一轮过度繁荣早已随20世纪80年代末垃圾债券市场崩盘与储蓄贷款合作社危机（Savings & Loan crisis）走到了末路。	His creed became the ethos of a decade of corporate and financial-sector excesses that ended in the late 1980’s collapse of the junk-bond market and the Savings & Loan crisis.
祖马似乎试图按照经济自由战士领导者兼委内瑞拉查韦斯方案崇拜者尤利乌斯·马勒马所指明的方向进行激进的资产再分配改造。	What Zuma seems to seek is radical asset redistribution in the direction suggested by Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters and an admirer of Venezuela’s chavista approach.
尽管仍低于2001年9月11日恐怖袭击后测得的46 % ， 但其比例却创下了近10年来美国人提到恐怖主义的新高。	This is the highest percentage of Americans to mention terrorism in a decade, although it is still lower than the 46% measured after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
由于让借款人避免违约 — — 至少暂时避免 — — 的唯一办法是提供不断增加的流动性，因此，即使银行面临流动性约束，也仍然愿意扩大新贷款。	Given that the only way to enable borrowers to avoid default – at least temporarily – has been to provide an ever-increasing amount of liquidity, even banks facing liquidity constraints have remained willing to extend new loans.
上海 — — 中国的“两会 ” （ 每年三月召开的一年一度的全国人民代表大会和中国人民政治协商会议）一直吸引着全球的目光。	SHANGHAI – China’s “Two Sessions” – the annual gatherings of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference held every March – have always drawn global attention.
艾利森将中国和美国代入其中，并将书起名为《注定的战争 》 （ Destined for War ） 。	Allison portrays China and the US in these roles, and calls his book Destined for War.
柏林—2015年巴黎气候协定签署后，许多决策者听信了石油和天然气行业关于如何帮助降低温室气体排放的说辞。	BERLIN – Since the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015, too many policymakers have fallen for the oil and gas industry’s rhetoric about how it can help to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
然而，自从苏联在1991年解体后，俄罗斯和中国已经开始寻求重新点燃在赫鲁晓夫在1956年谴责斯大林之前，曾经存在在苏联和毛泽东时代的中国之间的亲密关系。	Yet ever since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, Russia and China have sought to rekindle the close relations that once supposedly existed between the USSR and Mao’s China before Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin in 1956.
在今年6月3日，当我同其他记者一道参观关塔那摩的时候，那里的新闻办公室公布了一则简短的公告：阿尔-哈纳什被发现死在他自己的牢房内 — — 一起“显而易见的自杀事件 ” 。	On June 3, while I was visiting Guantánamo with other journalists, the press office there issued a terse announcement that al-Hanashi had had been found dead in his cell – an “apparent suicide.”
首先我们知道妇女生育头一胎的年龄越小，婴儿死亡率的风险也会随之而增加，但现代医学和保健学已经令这个概率大大降低，减少了低龄生育的风险。	First, we know that giving birth for the first time when younger carries a cost in increased infant mortality, but modern medicine and hygiene have strikingly reduced infant mortality, reducing the cost of younger age at first birth.
而自巴尔干战争结束以来，欧洲大陆的安全问题已不复存在（除了边缘地带，如格鲁吉亚；以及来自近邻，特别是阿拉伯世界的潜在威胁 ） 。	And, since the end of the Balkan wars, the continent’s security problems have disappeared (except at the margins, as in Georgia, or potential threats stemming from its near-abroad, particularly the Arab world).
尽管不同的估算结果相差很大，但2014年的一份联合国报告表明，光是改善基础设施，就需要高达7万亿美元的总投资。	Although estimates vary widely, one UN report from 2014 suggests that total investment of as much as $7 trillion will be required for infrastructure improvements alone.
贱民和印度的原住民（宪法中所列的“贱民和部落 ” ） 在印度的543人组成的议会中有权获得85个席位，这是为他们的社区“保留”的席位。	Dalits and India’s aboriginals (listed in the Constitution as “Scheduled Castes and Tribes”) are entitled to 85 seats in India’s 543-member parliament that are “reserved” for candidates from their communities.
举一个众所周知的例子，如果你欠银行1000美元，那么你要看银行脸色；但如果你欠银行10亿美元，你就拥有了凌驾于银行之上的强大的讨价还价能力。	To take a well-known example, if you owe a bank $1,000, the bank has power over you; but if you owe the bank $1 billion, you may have considerable bargaining power over the bank.
尽管某些足球比赛曾经激起暴力，甚至有一次引发了战争，但它们可能已经通过转移注意力，抑制了我们更加野蛮的冲动。	Even though some football games have provoked violence, and in one case even a war, they might have served the positive purpose of containing our more savage impulses by deflecting them onto a mere sport.
人类学中有一个总体生育率（Total Fertility Rate）的概念，指每个女性在其一生中的平均生育数量。	What demographers call the Total Fertility Rate is the average number of live births per woman over her lifetime.
尽管取得了令人瞩目的崛起，但2011年中国的人均收入只有10,057美元（经购买力平价调整 ） ， 位居世界第99位，只有美国人均收入49,782美元的五分之一。	Despite its remarkable rise, China’s per capita income, at $10,057 (adjusted for purchasing power) in 2011, ranks 99th in the world – roughly one-fifth of US per capita income of $49,782.
去年11月，在几年西非国家中央银行（Central Bank of West African States）成立50周年的会议上，塞内加尔总统麦基·萨尔（Macky Sall）要求削减利率。	Last November, at a conference marking the Central Bank of West African States’ 50th anniversary, Senegalese President Macky Sall pleaded for an interest-rate reduction.
因为监管者的决策会影响个人的财产权 — — 而它们的行动或者疏忽可能令纳税人陷入援助银行的圈套 — — 因此政府，议会和法院都必须要小心管好这只看门狗。	Because supervisors’ decisions affect individuals’ property rights – and their actions or omissions can put taxpayers on the hook to bail out banks – governments, parliaments, and the courts are bound to hold the watchdogs on a tight leash.
毕竟，由于有关性别差异的生物依据在过去一直被用来解释女性的从属地位，女性也因此不愿承认任何先天的差异，唯恐这会被当成对她们不利的证据。	After all, because biology-based arguments about gender difference have historically been used to justify women’s subjugation, women have been reluctant to concede any innate difference, lest it be used against them.
相反，他的团队构造了一个复杂而离奇的幻想 — — 它建立在几十年来共和党财政不负责任的基础上并远远过之。	Instead, his team has constructed an elaborate and rather bizarre fantasy – building upon but also going far beyond several decades of Republican fiscal irresponsibility.
然而在今年十月底，她最终为欧洲的未来勾勒了一个远景，并以此说服德国联邦议会同意拯救欧元的一揽子计划。	At the end of October, however, she finally articulated a vision of the future of Europe that persuaded the German Bundestag to agree to a package of measures to save the euro.
与此同时，税收竞赛将继续破坏市场竞争，也让政府无法获得资金投资于公共品。 而从长期看，公共品是确保企业盈利能力的必要条件。	In the meantime, tax competition will continue to erode market competition, while denuding governments of the money needed to invest in the public goods needed to ensure firms’ profitability over the long term.
将这些历史事实和神话中的象头移植相提并论是对科学 — — 以及实现这些科学成就、因此值得人们敬仰的人 — — 的严重亵渎。	Subsuming these historical facts in a narrative about mythological transplanted elephant heads did science – and the people whose achievements deserve to be honored – a serious disservice.
在英国，虚假和扭曲的说法，比如来自欧洲其他地区的不受限制的移民正在导致工资下降，部分助推了英国退欧公投。	In the United Kingdom, the Brexit vote was fueled partly by false and distorted claims, such as that unrestrained migration from the rest of Europe was driving down wages.
虽然必须实现跨境资本流动及汇率、利率市场化以保持经济增长，但是如果基准价格扭曲，这些改革将增加资产泡沫风险。	While cross-border capital flows and interest and exchange rates must be liberalized to maintain economic development, such reforms raise the risk of asset bubbles if implemented under distorted benchmark prices.
但还有许多较小规模的例子，比如俄克拉荷马城，该市的60万人口总共减掉了100万磅体重；我们希望参与其中的人们加入HICCup分享他们的经验，不论好坏。	But there are many smaller-scale examples, such as Oklahoma City, which lost one million pounds of collective weight in a population of about 600,000; we hope the people involved will join with HICCup to share their experiences, good and bad.
这个理念在小布什执政后期已经提出，目的是为了和某些东盟成员国构建联系 — — 比如新加坡，越南和文莱 — — 同时也涵盖其他太平洋国家。	This was proposed late in the Bush administration in order to forge links with some ASEAN members – Singapore, Vietnam, and Brunei – as well as others across the Pacific.
此后，金融部门将全部精力都花在了设计能规避价格波动、将私人债务转化为可交易金融证券并进入投机市场的金融工具上。	The financial sector has since made every effort to design instruments that protect against price fluctuations, to transform private debt into tradable financial securities, and to gain access to speculative markets.
阿巴斯就可以声称，他已经建议哈马斯续订停火协议并结束对以色列城镇的导弹袭击，但是，哈马斯却坚持使巴勒斯坦平民遭受战争的荼毒。	Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns, but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation.
即便统治者会反对那些会损害其民粹主义议程的政策 — — 如高利率 — — 但也常常会屈服于金融市场的压力。	Even when rulers rant against policies that will hurt their populist agendas – like high interest rates – they typically succumb to pressure from financial markets.
政府还声称我掌控了布鲁塞尔的欧洲机构，而且我正利用这样的控制对欧盟成员国强制推行邪恶的“索罗斯计划 ” 。	The government also claims that I control the European institutions in Brussels, and that I am using that control to impose the nefarious “Soros Plan” on EU member states.
amp#160;amp#160;amp#160; 目前研究的不同机器可以在网站www.roadabletimes.com找到。	The variety of machines currently under study is accessible at www.roadabletimes.com .
发自北京 — — 今年6月，中国人民银行宣布结束持续了23个月的人民币/美元汇率挂钩，并重新恢复到危机发生前2005年7月颁布实施的汇率管理办法。	BEIJING – In June, the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBC), China’s central bank, announced an end to the renminbi’s 23-month-old peg to the dollar and a return to the pre-crisis exchange-rate regime adopted in July 2005.
全世界最大的20个交易会（由室内展出面积衡量）有25个在德国举办，而且德国也在自然资源出口商位居首位。	Fifteen of the world’s 20 biggest trade fairs (measured by indoor exhibition space) are held in Germany, and the country tops the list in world commodity exports.
这种转移支付从就不是这一经济和货币联盟的特点，欧洲央行显然也不具备强制推动该联盟根本性变革的职权 — — 尤其是在这些变化只有利于一个国家集团的情况下。	Such transfers were never supposed to be a feature of the Economic and Monetary Union, and it is clearly not within the ECB’s mandate to force fundamental changes to the EMU system – especially if those changes favor one group of countries.
巴黎袭击发生后，法国和比利时（恐怖袭击预谋和组织的地方）无限期中止公民自由，一夜之间摇身一变成为（至少是法律意义上的）警察国家。	After the Paris attacks, France and Belgium (where the plot was planned and organized) suspended civil liberties indefinitely, transforming themselves overnight into what are, at least by statute, police states.
最近对于此项规定的修改允许银行收回房子，但是它们必须协助安排贷款者住进价格便宜一些的替代住房。 对于放贷者来说要将此付诸实施简直是一个行政性噩梦，尤其是如果有很多人同时开始违约的话。	A recent revision of that decision permits banks to repossess homes, but only if they help arrange alternative lower-cost housing – an administrative nightmare for lenders, particularly if a lot of people start defaulting at the same time.
核事故、公众反对和高投资成本已经导致核能投资急剧下降；20世纪70年代后期以来，美国再没有委托建造任何核电厂。	Nuclear accidents, public opposition, and high capital costs have already provoked a drastic drop in nuclear-energy investment; in the United States, no nuclear-power plant has been commissioned since the late 1970’s.
在审读了尼古丁中毒和尝试自杀的案例报告后，药物学家本恩德·梅耶（Bernd Mayer）发现人类尼古丁致死剂量必须要达到500—1000毫克吸收 — — 不仅是摄入 — — 尼古丁。	After reviewing case reports of nicotine intoxications and suicide attempts, the pharmacologist Bernd Mayer found that the lethal dose of nicotine in humans must be somewhere between 500-1000 mg of absorbed – not just ingested – nicotine.
新兴国家外汇储备总量自1994年以来首次出现下降。 从1994年开始，新兴市场外汇储备大幅攀升，成为过去二十年来全球经济的一个显著特征。	And the aggregate foreign-exchange reserves held by emerging countries declined for the first time since 1994, when they began the steep upward climb that has been a defining feature of the global economy during the last two decades.
巴黎—1948年，联合国大会通过了世界人权宣言，肯定了“人民的意愿 ” — —民主 — — 应该成为政府的基础。	PARIS – On December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirming the view that “the will of the people” – democracy – should form the basis of any government.
许多人认为全球不平衡是问题的根源，这种不平衡反映出美国的储蓄率近乎于零。 那些效仿美国最出色的经济体也是如此，包括英国，爱尔兰和西班牙。	The global imbalances that many people view as being at the root of the problem reflected savings rates of near zero in the US, as well as in those economies that seemed best to emulate the American model – the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Spain.
由于这个职位的任命并不需要国会的批准，总统可以指派任何他想要的人，而不会因他的选择被美国参议院痛骂。	Because this position does not require Congressional approval, the president may appoint whomever he wants, without having his choice raked over the coals in the US Senate.
美联储对欧洲的支持也令人瞩目，因为当时美国政府的其余部门事实上都是旁观者 — — 光说不练，并没有为欧元区受困经济体提供真金白银。	The Fed’s support for Europe was similarly remarkable, because the rest of the US government was an ineffective bystander at the time – able to offer cheap counsel but little hard cash to the eurozone’s distressed economies.
美联储可能“逐步减少”其量化宽松（QE）等迹象让投资者争相降低新兴市场风险敞口，导致新兴市场货币大幅贬值、股价崩盘。	Indications that the US Federal Reserve might “taper” its quantitative easing (QE) drove investors to reduce their exposure to emerging markets, sharply weakening their currencies and causing their equity prices to tumble.
实现这一目标的唯一途径是提高准入价格或凌驾国家主权之上以增加移民的总数 — — 两个选项在政治上都是站不住脚的。	The only way to achieve that would be to increase the price of admission or override national sovereignty to increase the total number of slots – both politically untenable options.
就在不久前， 英中两国政府、威康信托基金、美国生物医学高级研究与发展管理局（BARDA）以及丹麦制药企业诺和诺德联合成立了新的资助计划。	Just recently, new joint funding initiatives were launched by the British and Chinese governments, the Wellcome Trust, the United States’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo.
虽然他一心想要增加法国劳动力市场的灵活性，但同时又想阻止外国公司收购法国公司并保护空中客车公司的工人不被裁员。	Although he does want to make the French labor market less rigid, he would block foreign takeover bids of French companies and protect Airbus workers from possible job losses.
特朗普承诺再次减税被普遍视为共和党国会领导人 — — 最重要的是，该党最大的捐助者 — — 在2016年总统大选中支持他的主要原因，而且他们仍在这样做。	Trump’s promise to cut taxes again is widely viewed as a major reason why Republican congressional leaders – and, most important, the party’s big donors – supported him in 2016 and continued to do so.
而且，相对于财政政策而言，衰退保险不会对政府造成开销。 这是因为，如果它能够刺激信心，那么，所要保险的风险就不会发生。	Moreover, recession insurance might, in contrast to fiscal policy, impose no costs on the government, for if it stimulates confidence, then the risk being insured against is prevented.
按克林顿的说法，美国希望欧洲可以紧随其后，这样一来亚洲将不再仅仅是一个市场，而同时也是共同战略行动的焦点。	The US, according to Clinton, hopes that Europe will follow suit, so that Asia is seen not only as a market, but also as a focus of common strategic action.
而在其他国家，比如约旦、摩洛哥、科威特，也门和巴林，执政者在许多领域都将民主排除在外，而极端主义则迅速乘虚而入。	Other countries, such as Jordan, Morocco, Kuwait, Yemen, and Bahrain, have created more limited space for democracy. There, too, Islamists have immediately filled it.
在这场拥挤的权力角力中，只有日本置身事外，在很大程度上选择了冷眼旁观，并着力培养与美国的关系。 美国现在提供反导技术来对付朝鲜的威胁。	In this crowded power play, only Japan is left out, choosing for the most part to remain aloof and cultivate its relations with the US, which is now to supply anti-missile technology to counter the North Korean threat.
在地球上，央行行长和债券投资者还是有一些共同点的：他们都担心目前波动里极低的情况不可持续或并非好事。	Here on Earth, central bankers and bond investors have something in common: both worry that the current period of extremely low volatility is neither sustainable nor desirable.
国际奥委会如今已经成为了一座展现某些人类最低贱品行 — — 贪婪、 虚伪和剥削 — — 的屈辱柱，也正是这些导致很多机构丧失了人们的信任。	The IOC has become a monument to some of humanity’s worst tendencies – the greed, hypocrisy, and exploitation that have led so many to distrust institutions.
他的两本近著分别起名为《死于中国 》 （ Death by China，2011年）和《卧虎：中国军国主义对世界意味着什么 》 （ Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World，2015年 ） ， 里面充斥着地摊文学水平的偏见。	The titles of his two most recent books – Death by China (2011) and Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World (2015) – speak volumes about his tabloid-level biases.
热浪来袭期间，印度城市温度即使在夜间也有可能达到极值，从而导致睡眠对那些没有正规住所或现代制冷方式的人而言演变成一种痛苦。	During heat waves, urban temperatures in India can be extreme even at night, making sleeping agonizing for those without proper shelter or modern cooling methods.
而无限期QE实施过程中，通过抬升通胀预期压低实际利率的做法也有风险，最终会把高通胀预期的火焰煽起来。	And the reduction in real interest rates via a rise in expected inflation when open-ended QE is implemented risks eventually stoking inflation expectations.
美国的新保守主义者们已经把他们国家相当大的力量和道德权威浪费在和伊拉克那场无谓的战争上，心甘情愿地削弱了西方唯一的全球大国的力量。	America’s neo-conservatives have wasted a large part of their country’s power and moral authority in an unnecessary war in Iraq, willfully weakening the only global Western power.
德国加强了已然十分严格的劳动力市场监管、追求错误的能源政策、颠覆了养老金改革，它正在自挖当前经济局面的脚跟，朝问题国家迈进。	By reinforcing already-strict labor-market regulation, pursuing a misguided energy policy, and reversing pension reform, Germany is undermining its current economic position and will move in the direction of problem countries.
这起地方性恐怖事件具有全国性意义，因为它证明已故美国外交官兼战略家乔治·凯南的警告是正确的，凯南警告美国外交决策者应该遏制自己的行为冲动，特别是在军事方面。	This act of local horror was also one of national significance, for it vindicated the late US diplomat and strategist George F. Kennan’s warning that American foreign policymakers should hold in check their urge to act, especially militarily.
光是在过去五年，就有数万人丧生，近四分之一人口流离失所，其中许多人只能逃往邻近的肯尼亚、乌干达和苏丹。	In the last five years alone, tens of thousands have died, and nearly a quarter of the population has been displaced, with many having little choice but to flee to neighboring Kenya, Uganda, or Sudan.
用进口弥补储量的下降 — — 大约一半的天然气储量和五分之一石油储量已经被用掉了 — — 意味着每年要花去3000亿美元以上的成本。	Covering this drop in reserves – more than half of gas reserves and a fifth of oil reserves have been consumed – with imports implies an annual cost of more than $300 billion.
两国都在寻求为亚洲建立可行的和平结构，这个结构将允许中国继续成长和繁荣，也将阻止任何国家的霸权行为。	Both countries seek to create a viable structure of peace for Asia, one that allows China to continue to grow and prosper, but that prevents any one country from claiming hegemony.
毕竟，过去造成的投资短缺必须得到弥补，与此同时，还要进行面向未来的投资，因此当下的一代就不得不背负起双重负担。	After all, past investment shortfalls have to be made up and future-oriented investments undertaken simultaneously – a double burden that must be borne by the current generation.
公众对于非法入境问题的抗议声越来越大，但是对怎样处理那些已经在国内非法居住了数年或者未来想要到美国来的那些人并没有达成一致的意见。	There is growing opposition to illegal entry, but no consensus about what to do about those who have been in the country illegally for years or those who want to come to the US in the future.
最可靠的数据表明，他成功地减少了不平等性；在他执政期间，委内瑞拉的基尼系数（衡量收入不平等性的百分制指标）从50下降至39，是拉丁美洲国家中下降幅度最大的。	The most reliable data suggest that he was successful at reducing inequality; during his rule, Venezuela’s Gini coefficient, a 100-point scale measuring income inequality, fell from 50 to 39, the biggest decline in Latin America.
流通于欧元区的所有资金都产生于这五个国家，并随后大部分用于购买北欧成员国商品和资产以及偿还外国债务。	All the money circulating in the eurozone originated in these five countries and was then largely used to buy goods and assets in the northern member countries and redeem foreign debt taken from them.
贝鲁特—三年前，区域民意调查显示中东地区最受人们爱戴的领导是真主党领袖哈桑·纳斯鲁拉，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德以及伊朗总统马哈茂德·艾哈迈迪－内贾德。	BEIRUT –Three years ago, regional opinion polls showed that the Middle East’s most popular leaders were Hezbollah leader Sayed Hassan Nasrallah, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
除非民主世界明白现在决非相信外交妥协的时候、必须以足够强硬的立场阻止普京的帝国图谋，否则事件可能朝不可收拾的方向发展。	Unless the democratic world understands that now is not the time for faith in diplomatic compromise, and that it must respond strongly enough to stop Putin’s imperial designs, events could follow a logic that is too dreadful to contemplate.
类似地，英国的保守党政府 — — 它支持退欧的民粹主义目的 — — 最近也宣布了新一轮数十亿英镑规模的社会保障、教育和工作阶级税收优惠削减。	Similarly, Britain’s Tory government, which has espoused Brexit’s populist aims, has recently announced another multi-billion-pound reduction in social security, education, and tax credits for the working poor.
上一次通过全面经济抵制让伊朗石油出口下降到可忽略水平是在二十世纪中叶，当时，伊朗深孚众望的当选总理摩萨德实施了石油工业国有化。	The last time Iran’s oil exports were reduced to negligible levels through an extensive economic boycott was in the mid-twentieth century, when Iran’s popularly elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, nationalized the oil industry.
即便是在经济快速发展的国家，由人口统计上的巨大变化所驱动的一系列因素，已经悄然将知识、社会责任和生活机会的不平等从一代人转移到下一代人。	Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next.
25年来最严重的经济减速让预算赤字扩大到创纪录的水平，巴西总统罗塞夫被迫转向紧缩，包括削减失业救济的福利补贴。	With the most severe economic slowdown in 25 years expanding the budget deficit to record levels, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has been forced to turn to austerity, including cuts in unemployment and welfare benefits.
比如，欧洲和世界的未来状态充满了不确定性，争论扩张或TTIP似乎毫无意义 — — 甚至更加糟糕，因为即使开放这些讨论也必然正中欧洲怀疑派下怀。	For example, given so much uncertainty about the future state of Europe and the world, debating enlargement or the TTIP seems pointless – or worse, because even opening such discussions is certain to play into the hands of Euroskeptics.
举个例子，限制公共开支增长率（势头）可以作为债务标准的一个补充，这个增长率不允许超过国内生产总值限定的百分比。	The debt criterion, for example, could be supplemented by a limit on the (trend) growth rate of public spending, which would be kept below that of nominal GDP.
但以色列方面却仍未公开答应美国和巴勒斯坦关于停止在耶路撒冷兴建犹太人定居点的要求，而此项要求是在美国副总统乔·拜登最近的以色列之行中敲定的。	But Israel has not publicly agreed to the American and Palestinian request to rescind the settlement construction in Jerusalem approved during US Vice President Joe Biden’s recent visit to Israel.
如果哈梅内伊迅速攫紧权力，穆斯维就难以到总统之位，但他至少还继续承载着那些与政府意见相左的大多数伊朗人的期望。	If Khamenei holds fast, Mousavi cannot gain the presidency, but he will continue to represent the hopes of the majority of Iranians who differ dramatically with their government.
顺理成章的结果是恐惧得到了遏制：当被问及移民是否抢走了本土居民的就业机会时，80％的德国人及77％的瑞典人都表示并非如此。	As a result, fear is muted: asked whether immigrants take away jobs from native-born citizens, 80% of Germans and 77% of Swedes said that they do not.
埃及政府需要维持稳定的外国融资,以支撑整个国家,并以此来平衡国际上对穆尔西施行的有违埃及基本人权 的措施的反对之声。	Egypt’s government needs to secure consistent foreign financing to keep the country afloat, providing leverage for international opposition to Morsi’s efforts to impose an agenda that runs contrary to Egyptians’ fundamental rights.
因此，当意识形态与其势不两立的共和党反对派在其入主白宫的第一天就采取焦土政策，把这一愿景当着他的面踩得粉碎的时候，其拒绝合作并非只关乎政策，而是影响到了奥巴马的为人。	So, when an ideologically implacable Republican opposition, in his very first days in office, threw the vision back in his face, adopting a policy of scorched-earth opposition, the rejection was about more than policy – it affected his very being.
汉斯莫拉维茨和其他计算机科学家在20世纪80年代时指出，对我们来说轻而易举的事情，对最先进的人工智能来说也是难于上青天；反之，人工智能常常能够轻松完成我们认为困难的事情。	Hans Moravec and other computer scientists pointed out in the 1980s that what is simple for us is hard for even the most sophisticated AI; conversely, AI often can do easily what we regard as difficult.
事实上，一些欧洲穆斯林曾远赴阿富汗，巴基斯坦和伊拉克；另外一些曾东渡也门和索马里拜师学艺，学成归来后，他们成为坚定的激进分子和反抗西方的战士，在他们眼中，西方使伊斯兰蒙羞。	True, some young European Muslims have traveled to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq; some went as far as Yemen and Somalia, and came back as hardened radicals, soldiers in a war against a West that, in their view, dishonors Islam.
现在，欧盟委员会要等到本月底才能确定法国是否足够认真地对待改革，因而可以避免因为没有履行其明年将预算赤字削减至GDP的3%以下的承诺而遭受惩罚。	The Commission now has until the end of this month to determine whether France has pursued reform diligently enough to avoid penalties for breaking its pledge to cut its budget deficit to less than 3% of GDP by next year.
按照这位离过两次婚、公开声称自己是“文化天主教徒”的总统的说法，法国应该建立一种“积极的世俗主义 ” 。	In particular, according to the twice-divorced self-confessed “cultural Catholic,” France should develop a “positive secularism.”
但是，一些观察者 — — 而不仅仅是一贯的悲观派 — — 反驳说证据仍然只是偶然的，无法预测当前经济状况会持续多久。	Still, some observers – and not just chronic pessimists – have countered that the evidence remains anecdotal, and that it is impossible to predict how long the current economic moment will last.
但指望简单的答案 — — 如更多财政刺激或更多紧缩 — — 成为万灵丹是不正确的；在更多时候，根本问题与债务、结构僵化、投资不足和竞争力疲软有关。	But it is wrong to believe that simplistic answers, such as more fiscal stimulus or more austerity, are a panacea; more often, the underlying problems relate to debt, structural rigidities, low investment, and weak competitiveness.
1951年到1969年的君主制统治期间，伊德里斯国王的亲属及核心集团的铁蹄无情践踏了羽翼未丰的国家机构。	Under a monarchy that led the country from 1951-1969, King Idris’s relatives and inner circle ran roughshod over fledgling state institutions.
不同于自由主义者和左翼人士，右翼及伊斯兰意识形态宣传的社会秩序和日常生活愿景专制、等级森严并往往遵循某种仪式。	Unlike liberals and the left, right-wing and Islamist ideologues promote an authoritarian, hierarchical, and often ritualized vision of social order and daily life.
美国和欧盟（它们对库尔德人独立的概念反应都相当冷静）的一个选择是支持或参与库尔德斯坦地区政府（KRG）和伊拉克政府在巴格达的谈判。	One option for the US and the European Union (which has been similarly cool to the idea of Kurdish independence) would be to support or participate in negotiations between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Iraqi government in Baghdad.
)但是，当我询问首相近况如何时，他马上咧着嘴回答说 ： “ 当你知道不必在位另一场选举而战时，感觉好极了 。 ”	But no sooner had I asked the Prime Minister how he was than he replied with a grin: “It’s nice to know one doesn’t have to fight another election.”
这一巨型地区协议可能还有一个与世贸组织共有的优势：更多的参与方可以淡化主导国的威权，从而阻止其强迫谈判伙伴屈从于不平衡的协定。	The mega-regional approach may have one more advantage, shared with the WTO: the involvement of more parties can dilute the authority of a major country and thus limit its ability to strong-arm its negotiating partners into an unbalanced agreement.
例如在大萧条时期，美国总统赫伯特·胡佛签署了1930年《斯穆特-霍利关税法案 》 ， 意图保护美国工人和农民免受外国竞争。	For example, during the Great Depression, US President Herbert Hoover signed the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, intended to protect American workers and farmers from foreign competition.
7月6日，他最新的贸易限制措施 — — 对总值约340亿美元的中国进口产品征收25％的关税 — — 正式生效。	On July 6, his latest trade restrictions – 25% tariffs on about $34 billion of Chinese imports – took effect.
但2000年9月，在第55界联合国大会上，189个国家的领导人启动了千年发展计划，这些截止期也就无疾而终了。	Yet those deadlines had come and gone when, in September 2000, during the 55th UN General Assembly, leaders of 189 nations adopted the MDGs.
今年德国的绿色补贴将耗资236亿美元，居民电价从2000年来上涨了80 % ， 导致690万家庭陷入能源贫困。	In Germany, where green subsidies will cost €23.6 billion this year, household electricity prices have increased by 80% since 2000, causing 6.9 million households to live in energy poverty.
最近，中国的增长很大程度上依靠债务融资的投资 — — 通常是基础设施和住房等项目，旨在支持中国梦 — — 因此任何控制信用增长的努力都有可能导致硬着陆。	Given that China owes much of its recent growth to debt-financed investment – often in projects like infrastructure and housing, meant to support the Chinese Dream – any effort to get credit growth under control is likely to cause a hard landing.
协议继续要求初级预算盈余（不含利息支付）到2018年增加至GDP的3.5 % ， 这将恶化希腊衰退。	The agreement continues to require primary budget surpluses (net of interest payments), rising to 3.5% of GDP by 2018, which will worsen Greece’s slump.
坎布里奇 — — 在5月下旬典型的一周，共和党的假定总统提名人唐纳德·特朗普再次登上了报纸的头版头条。	CAMBRIDGE – During a typical week in late May, Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the US presidency, grabbed headlines yet again.
自2016年政变失败以来，土耳其法庭已经审理了约4，6000起涉及起诉民众侮辱总统、民族或国家机构的案子。	Since a failed coup attempt in 2016, Turkey’s courts have processed some 46,000 cases involving people accused of insulting the president, the nation, or its institutions.
主权债务水平高企，加上金融部门中某些部分的不当行为，放大了欧元区危机，也造成了重要的信心问题，如今需要系统性方案才能解决。	High levels of sovereign debt, together with the behavior of parts of the financial sector, have amplified the crisis in the eurozone and raised important issues of confidence that now require a systemic answer.
进步变化研究所（Progressive Change Institute）正在运作“大观点工程 ” （ The Big Ideas Project ） ， 人们投票选择他们所认为的最重要的政策议案。	The Progressive Change Institute is currently running “The Big Ideas Project,” whereby people can vote on what they regard as the most important policy proposals.
逊尼派阿拉伯政党起初不愿接受任何邦联国家理念，但随着时间推移，他们开始相信什叶派政党永远不会自愿分权。	The Sunni Arab parties initially rejected any notion of a confederated state, but in time they came to believe that the Shia parties would never share power voluntarily.
而且可能不会有太多警告，因为气候影响通常不会以线性方式逐渐演变，而是突然剧烈出现，一旦我们实现对某个临界点的突破。	And we may not get much warning, because climate effects generally do not evolve in a linear fashion, but rather emerge suddenly and powerfully, once certain tipping points have been reached.
美国与比利时进行八分之一决赛的那个星期二下午，科罗拉多州阿斯彭（Aspen）的每一间酒吧都坐满了人。	On the Tuesday afternoon when the US played Belgium in the knockout round, every bar in Aspen, Colorado, was packed.
那些自觉幸福的人往往寿命更长，更少出现自杀，滥用药物或者酗酒等行为，更容易升职，朋友更多，婚姻也更长久。	People who claim to be happy tend to live longer, commit suicide and abuse drugs and alcohol less often, get promoted more frequently by their employers, and enjoy more good friends and lasting marriages.
而仅仅一个月前，大概还有很多人从来没听说过戴维的祖国，一个与莫桑比克、赞比亚和坦桑尼亚接壤的仅有1300万人口的非洲内陆国家。	A month before, it seems safe to assume, many of these people had never heard of his native land, a landlocked African nation of about 13 million people bordering Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania.
这种冲击可能来自于国内，而且会以不同形式出现，例如卷土重来的通胀或美国总统特朗普也已发动的贸易战持续升级。	That shock could be homegrown, coming in the form, say, of renewed inflation or of the continued escalation of the trade war that US President Donald Trump has started.
IMF所辨别的第二大挑战 — — 欧元区银行体系容量过剩及相关的不良贷款问题 — — 理论上也是可以解决的。	The second big challenge that the IMF identifies – excess capacity in the eurozone banking system, and the related problem of non-performing loans – is also, in principle, solvable.
但这意味着军队将回归到政治核心 — — 进而牺牲掉强化民众控制这一穆尔西去年8月当选以来的最大进步。	But this would mean returning the army to the center of politics – and thus sacrificing the gains from Morsi’s imposition last August of greater civilian control.
但在拉詹和政府一幕上演之后 — — 同时考虑到这一事件令人厌恶的进展方式 — — 人们有理由担心印度现在也会犯下经济管理方面的错误。	But, following the episode between Rajan and the government – and considering the unsavory manner in which it played out – there is reason to worry that India, too, may now stumble in its economic governance.
但韩国等国家正在感受中国崛起的压力 — — 中国单方面扩大其放空区所引起的愤怒即是明证 — — 它们将会有热烈的反应。	But countries like South Korea that are feeling the pressure of China’s rise – as demonstrated by the current furor over China’s unilateral expansion of its air defense zone – may well reciprocate such an effort.
事实上，由于商品价格偏低，世界可能将于2009年目睹俄罗斯和巴西的准衰退，中国和印度则会大大放慢速度，这对于这些国家来说就等同于硬着陆（增长大大低于潜能 ） 。	Indeed, the world should expect a near recession in Russia and Brazil in 2009, owing to low commodity prices, and a sharp slowdown in China and India that will be the equivalent of a hard landing (growth well below potential) for these countries.
不过，目前还不清楚中国将以何种方式着陆 — — 这不仅是因为官方统计数据可能极大夸大了当前的GDP增长。	Still, it is unclear what kind of landing China faces – not least because official statistics may be overstating current GDP growth considerably.
有关宗教和科学的丑陋辩论通常看似局限在美国。 但是，最近几个月来，这场辩论开始蔓延，首先到欧洲，然后遍布全球。	Ugly debates about religion and science usually seem to be confined to the United States. In recent months, however, such debates have begun to spread – first to Europe and then around the world.
美国人是后来者，但朝鲜对美帝国主义的官方仇恨不仅来自于野蛮的朝鲜战争，同时也来自于外国压迫留下的漫长而痛苦的记忆。	The Americans are latecomers, but official hatred of American imperialism in North Korea stems not only from the savage Korean War, but also from the long memory of foreign oppression.
其二，克鲁格曼没有解释为何在2008~2009年被证明有效的凯恩斯主义政策会如此迅速地被财政紧缩政策逆转和取代。	Second, Krugman fails to explain why the Keynesian policies vindicated in 2008-2009 were so rapidly reversed and replaced by fiscal austerity.
对我和我的政府来说，眼前的主要任务 — — 更加努力地复兴日本经济 — — 与捍卫日本在全球和���、进步与繁荣事业中的先锋地位是不可分割的。	For me and my government, the main task ahead – working even harder to restore Japan’s economy – is inseparable from safeguarding our country’s position in the global vanguard of peace, progress, and prosperity.
结果英国本土的外国劳工数量自1993年以来翻了一番，达到600余万，相当于总劳动力的10 ％ ， 如今大部分都来自非欧盟其他原始成员国的低工资国家。	As a result, the number of foreign-born workers in Britain has doubled since 1993, to more than six million, or 10% of the labor force, with most now coming from low-wage countries that were not among the EU’s other original members.
你或许会批评布洛克观点的某些细节：如果能够根深地理解凯恩斯，他将能更有力地反驳“如果国家出资的项目值得进行，那么私人部门早就在这么做了”之类的诘难。	One can criticize details of Brock’s case: a deeper understanding of Keynes would have given him a more persuasive response to the objection that, if state-financed projects were worth doing, the private sector would be doing them.
鉴于出口产品中的德国附加值总量增长仅仅是由于德国专门从事与出口有关的生产的效应，因此，不能因此而得出较佳的评估。	A favorable assessment cannot rest on the fact that the overall German value-added in exports has been growing because this is simply an effect of the German specialization in export-related production.
2009~2014年间，发展中国家总共获得了2.2万亿美元的净资本流入，部分原因是发达经济体的量化宽松政策在令利率处于近零水平。	During 2009-2014, developing countries collectively received a net capital inflow of $2.2 trillion, partly owing to quantitative easing in advanced economies, which pushed interest rates there to near zero.
范龙佩的眼光显然会比一个任期六个月的国家总统更为长远，而阿什顿女士则能够把欧盟对外政策的政治与资源整合起来。	Van Rompuy will be able to offer a longer view than that of a six-month national presidency. Lady Ashton should be able to tie together the political and resource arms of Europe’s external policies.
即便不考虑转移支付在大多数国家已经在财政上不可持续的事实（因为该政策早在经济和人口构成尚处于理想状态时就被实施和扩大了 ） ， 它们是否就能提振经济呢？	Leaving aside the fact that transfer payments are already fiscally unsustainable in most countries (because they were adopted and expanded under better economic and demographic conditions), could they lift the economy?
人均收入基尼系数已经超过了50（100代表最大程度的不平等 ） ， 这意味着中国已经步入世界上最不平等的四分之一国家行列。	The Gini coefficient of per capita income has surpassed 50 (with 100 representing maximal inequality), putting China in the upper quartile of inequality worldwide.
因此，美国消费的持续疲软意味着出口导向发展中经济体将承受压力。 好消息是这将迫使它们实施早就应该实施的以刺激国内消费需求为目标的再平衡战略。	So enduring weakness in US consumption implies pressure on the growth of export-led developing economies. The good news is that will force them to embrace long-overdue rebalancing strategies aimed at stimulating domestic consumer demand.
如果人均收入可以作为评判标准，那么摩纳哥、卡塔尔、卢森堡、文莱、列支敦士登、科威特、挪威和新加坡都比美国排名靠前。	If per capita income were the criterion by which to judge, Monaco, Qatar, Luxembourg, Brunei, Liechtenstein, Kuwait, Norway, and Singapore would all rank ahead of the US.
2008年全球危机爆发时，我们还没有保护跨国银行业务网的监管框架，因此暴露出了极大的脆弱性，比如杠杆率过高和外汇风险。	When the global crisis erupted in 2008, there was no regulatory framework to protect the cross-border networks, and large vulnerabilities, in the form of excessive leverage and foreign exchange, were exposed.
许多支持英国退出的人搬出一些政策和监管规则 — — 比如欧盟与加拿大和新加坡的自由贸易协定 — — 胡乱拼凑出一幅身在欧洲之外的英国的图景。	Many advocates of withdrawal cherry-pick policies and regulations, such as provisions of the EU’s free-trade agreements with Canada and Singapore, to cobble together a vision of what life would like be for the UK outside of Europe.
托克维克拒绝反动的恋旧，认为我们注定会获得民主的胜利，同时又警告民主对自由构成危险。 他因此理所当然地闻名于世。	Tocqueville is justly famous for rejecting reactionary nostalgia and regarding democracy’s triumph as our destiny, while warning against the dangers that democracy holds for liberty.
但如果市场原教旨主义阻挠扩张性宏观经济政策、阻止再分配性税收或公共支出，那么针对贸易、劳动力市场去监管和退休金改革的民粹主义反对必然会加剧。	But if market fundamentalism blocks expansionary macroeconomic policies and prevents redistributive taxation or public spending, populist resistance to trade, labor-market deregulation, and pension reform is bound to intensify.
IMF的模拟测试结果表明，全球增长率下降1.5个百分点将通过其对贸易和金融流的影响，光是在2012年就将造成270亿美元的外部融资缺口。	Simulations by the International Monetary Fund suggest that a decline in global growth of 1.5 percentage points could, owing to its impact on trade and financial flows, generate a $27 billion gap in additional external financing in 2012 alone.
根据国际能源署的最新《世界能源投资 》 （ World Energy Investment）报告，2016年全球石油和天然气行业总支出高达6,490亿美元。	According to the most recent World Energy Investment report from the International Energy Agency, global expenditure in the oil and gas sector totaled $649 billion in 2016.
此外中国面向互联性的狂飙还远未停止：在2011年中期，13亿中国人中只有36%能够上网 — — 这个数字相比韩国，日本和美国等地高达80%的渗透率来说还是偏低。	Moreover, China’s rush to connectivity is far from over. As of mid-2011, only 36% of its 1.3 billion people were connected – far short of the nearly 80% penetration rates seen in South Korea, Japan, and the United States.
这些包括斯堪的那维亚国家、西班牙和日本发生的巨大的危机，以及二十世纪八十年代美国储蓄和贷款危机等较为轻微的事件。	These include epic crises in the Scandinavian countries, Spain, and Japan, along with lesser events such as the US savings and loan crises of the 1980’s.
由此产生了包括400多家机构和4,000多个活跃发明者在内的全球网络，它所申请的专利比许多研发密集型公司还要多。	The resulting global network of more than 400 institutions and over 4,000 active inventors has produced more patent applications than many R&D-intensive companies do.
在英国，亲普京的英国独立党（UK Independence Party）正在挖首相卡梅伦的墙角，因此英国政府拒绝承担合理的难民负担。	In the United Kingdom, the pro-Putin UK Independence Party is nipping at Prime Minister David Cameron’s heels, so the government refuses to commit to taking Britain’s fair share of refugees.
出口活动需要的具体规则、基础设施、技能和技术掌握往往与创造当地大部分就业机会的非贸易活动相比有着显著的区别。	The specific rules, infrastructure, skills, and technological mastery that export activities require tend to be different from those needed for the non-tradable activities that usually generate the bulk of a place’s employment.
自1953年朝鲜战争休战协定签署以来，三八线便一直是美军行动的界线；朝鲜战争对中国的重要性决不能忘记。	After the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953, the 38th parallel was established as the limit for US forces’ presence; the importance of that war for China should not be forgotten.
普京的主张 — — 法西斯主义者控制了基辅 — — 是彻头彻尾的谎言，而俄罗斯在克里米亚和东乌克兰的卑劣行动则是铁一样的事实。	Putin’s claim that fascists have taken control in Kyiv is fundamentally bogus, while Russia’s despicable actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine are all too real.
尽管普京表示准备授权采取针对可疑恐怖分子的打击 ， “ 不管他们身在何处 ” ， 但恐怖袭击仍在继续发生。	The attacks have continued, despite Putin’s stated willingness to authorize strikes against suspected terrorists, “wherever they may be.”
去年8月，中国宣布准备允许人民币略有贬值，并计划最终实现人民币更加自由的浮动，这引起了金融市场的“过山车 ” 。	China’s announcement last August of its intent to allow modest depreciation and eventually move the renminbi toward greater exchange-rate flexibility triggered a roller-coaster ride in financial markets.
在莱特兄弟和柯蒂斯兄弟最初的创新工作后，重复的专利申请严重阻碍了飞机的研制，一直到第一次世界大战爆发前，美国政府强制推行专利共享制度，这个问题才最终得以解决。	After the pioneering work of the Wright brothers and the Curtis brothers, overlapping patent claims thwarted the development of the airplane, until the United States government finally forced a patent pool as World War I loomed.
一方面，发展中国家应该认识到虽然数字技术的破坏性影响不断加剧，却也不可能在一夜之间淘汰它们的增长模式。	On one hand, developing countries should recognize that disruption, while happening fast, will not render their growth models obsolete overnight.
这不是滥用某个工具（当利益集团游说要求加入外部竞争保护条款时，这种情况经常发生 ） ； 相反，这属于完全按照预想方式使用工具。	This would not be a case of misusing a tool (a frequent occurrence in trade policy when interest groups lobby for protection against foreign competition); rather, it would be a case of using the tool in precisely the intended way.
他们手中的铀并非武器级材料；国际核查人员在1991年海湾战争后将所有敏感材料运出了伊拉克（2003年美国入侵时也因此没有找到任何敏感材料 ） 。	The captured uranium was not weapons-grade; international inspectors removed all sensitive material from Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War (which is why it was absent when the United States invaded in 2003).
我希望如此。 但对我而言，一项以国内私有消费、医疗和教育为主题的计划比一项基于与前30年相同的增长战略的计划更有说服力。	I hope so, but I would be more convinced by a plan tilted more toward domestic private consumption, health, and education than to one based on the same growth strategy of the past 30 years.
世界银行和世界野生动植物基金组织最近承诺将联合起来，争取在2010年以前把全球的采伐率降低10个百分点，并且和其它公共机构以及私人团体一同朝着森林保护的伟大目标前进。	The World Bank and WWF recently pledged to unite in an effort to assist in reducing the rate of global deforestation by 10% by 2010, and to work with other public and private sector institutions to pursue ambitious targets on forest conservation.
巴西正与遍布南大西洋两岸的邻国密切合作为保护海洋避免对抗及核武器而加强南大西洋和平合作区（ZPCSA）的建设。	With our neighbors on both shores of the South Atlantic, Brazil is working closely to strengthen the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic (ZPCSA), which aims to keep the ocean free from rivalries foreign to it and from nuclear weapons.
没有人知道达沃斯的非洲领导人 — — 他们中的许多人公开谴责特朗普的言论，要求道歉并撤回 — — 在亲眼见到这人时会做出何种反应。	There is no telling how African leaders at Davos – many of whom have publicly denounced Trump’s comments, demanding apologies and retractions – will react to the man in the flesh.
比如，我们需要加强对零售金融产品消费者的保护，对新债券实行更为严格的披露机制，并且设计出更好的避险工具。	For example, we need stronger consumer protection for retail financial products, stricter disclosure requirements for new securities, and better-designed vehicles for hedging risks.
但是，随着新经济强国的崛起，它们开始日益挑战西方，它们的目标不仅仅是市场份额和资源；它们还将寻求往全球秩序中注入它们自身的文化体系（或软实力 ） 。	But, as new economic powerhouses rise, they will increasingly challenge the West, and not just for market share and resources; they will seek to infuse the global order with their own cultural understandings and frames of reference.
在一个大布告板上孤零零地贴着一张求职意向书，上面写着“年轻女性，性格温和无不良嗜好，愿意承担水泥销售工作 ” 。	A forlorn job application on a large signpost reads, “Nice girl, gentle without bad habits, will sell cement.”
毫无疑问，特朗普也想着自己能够完成这样的“壮举 ” ， 既中止罗伯特·穆勒（Robert Mueller）领衔的对他的调查，又让美国情报机关屈服于自己。	No doubt, Trump wishes that he could pull off such a stunt, and both halt the investigation of him led by Robert Mueller and bring to heel all of the US intelligence agencies.
特别是虽然中国的贸易部门受到了发达国家的极大影响，但政府也愿意接受一些短期的减速，而非采取一些可能引发混乱的刺激措施。	In particular, although China’s tradable sector is highly exposed to developed economies, the government is likely to accept some short-run slowdown, rather than adopting potentially distorting stimulus measures.
气候变化、毒化，以及生物多样性和生态系统功能的丧失导致环境日益恶化，人们进行旨在减少不平等性或保护环境的治理改革的时间和能量也越来越少。	As environments deteriorate from climate change, toxification, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, people will have less time and energy for governance reform aimed at reducing inequality or preserving the environment.
If emissions were appropriately restricted, the value of emission rights would be a couple trillion dollars a year – no wonder that there is a squabble over who should get them.	If emissions were appropriately restricted, the value of emission rights would be a couple trillion dollars a year – no wonder that there is a squabble over who should get them.
阿拉伯社会乱象注定将维持多年，不难预计，新兴地区和世界强国将利用国际秩序的破碎谋求自身在该地区的利益。	Turmoil in Arab societies is bound to persist for years to come, and emerging regional and world powers can be expected to exploit the international order’s fragmentation to advance their interests in the region.
类似地，马可尼在长途无线电传输方面的工作原本只是为了与电报竞争；他从未构想过广播电台和现代无线通讯。	Likewise, Guglielmo Marconi’s work on long-distance radio transmission was intended simply to create competition for the telegraph; Marconi never envisioned broadcast radio stations or modern wireless communication.
有可能发生的冲突还可以成倍增加，从核裁军—法国裁得太多，其他国家太少���到和伊朗，俄罗斯和中国打交道的最佳方法。	And one could multiply the subjects of possible tensions, from nuclear disarmament – too much for the French, too little for many others – to the best ways to deal with Iran, Russia, and China.
似是而非的是，在掌控如此重要的权力如此之久以后，谁也说不清布莱尔会对英国国内留下什么影响，如果有影响的话。	The paradox is that, for a man who wielded so much power for so long, it is unclear what domestic legacy, if any, Blair will leave.
在这些“意向”变成“承诺”之前 ，捐款人应认真审查格鲁吉亚的经济发展战略并评估其人道主义援助和重建援助的计划。	Before these “pledges” become “commitments,” donors should carefully examine Georgia’s economic development strategy and assess its plans for humanitarian and reconstruction aid.
此前，含铅油漆和汽油据估计每年也要造成150,000多人死亡，而全球变暖造成的死亡人数为141,000人。	Previous generations’ use of lead in paints and gasoline is estimated to cause almost 700,000 deaths annually. Ground-level ozone pollution kills more than 150,000 people per year, while global warming causes another 141,000 deaths.
比如，在上个月的达沃斯世界经济论坛年会上，美国财政部长史蒂文·努钦（Steven Mnuchin）积极评价了弱势美元，称其为提振美国贸易的手段。	For example, at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos last month, US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin spoke positively about a weaker dollar as a way to boost US trade.
丹佛 — — 美国总统唐纳德·特朗普已决定拒绝承认伊朗履行了限制其核武计划相关协议《全面联合行动计划 》 （ JCPOA）的规定。	DENVER – US President Donald Trump has decided not to certify that Iran is in compliance with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the agreement constraining Iran’s nuclear-weapons program.
普京对国家媒体的控制自2013年12月以来一直在收紧，今日俄罗斯财团对各频道展开重组以便更好地报道俄罗斯“新闻 ” 。	Putin’s grip on state media has been tightening since December 2013, when channels were regrouped in the Rossiya Segodnya consortium to improve the presentation of Russia’s “story.”
我们知道，土耳其军中有着庞大的居伦派（否则早先政府针对土耳其高级官员的举动 — — 所谓的艾尔格尼肯和铁锤案（Eregenekon and Sledgehammer cases ） — —也不会进行 ） 。	We know that there is a strong Gülenist presence in the military (without which the government’s earlier move against senior Turkish officers – the so-called Eregenekon and Sledgehammer cases – could not have been mounted).
比如，在GBIRd工程上，我们可以问问“生不出女儿的老鼠”是否会从引入它们的生态系统中逃逸 — — 转基因庄稼和养殖三文鱼就发生过这种情况 — — 以及如果逃逸会发生什么。	When it comes to the GBIRd project, for example, one might ask whether the “daughterless mouse” could escape the specific ecosystem into which it has been introduced, just as GMO crops and farmed salmon do, and what would happen if it did.
所以，不幸的是，即便欧洲即时醒悟，且新兴市场国家也对自由贸易抱有更大的热情，我们或许还是不能指望在未来十年里会达成大宗的全球性贸易协议。	So, unfortunately, even if Europe came to its senses and emerging markets showed greater enthusiasm for liberal trade, we may not see a big global deal until the next decade.
在伊朗之前，美国拒绝轰炸叙利亚（沙特在中东地区的另一大对手 ） ， 还在2011年祝福了前埃及总统穆巴拉克的下台（沙特的重要盟友 ） 。	The falling out over Iran follows America’s refusal to bomb Syria (another Saudi rival in the region) and its blessing of the removal in 2011 of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (an important Saudi ally).
尽管主要的外国美元持有者例如中国突然间大范围抛售美元看起来不大可能，但是，某一类似于1914年第一次世界大战爆发那样的灾难性事件有可能促使人们寻求一种新的国际交易媒介。	While a broad and abrupt sell-off by major foreign holders of dollars – for example, China – appears unlikely, a cataclysmic event, similar to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange.
伯克利—几年前，我发现当今社会科学家都站在马基雅维利、洛克、斯密、托克维尔、马克斯·韦伯和涂尔干等巨人的肩上。	BERKELEY – Several years ago, it occurred to me that social scientists today are all standing on the shoulders of giants like Niccolo Machiavelli, John Locke, Adam Smith, Alexis de Tocqueville, Max Weber, and Émile Durkheim.
首先，它依赖于一些过分大胆的假设 — — 例如说人们一定无法轻易破解这个迷宫般的系统，而外国政府也不会采取限制性手段来报复性征税。	First, it relies on some heroic assumptions – for example, that people cannot easily game the labyrinthine system and that foreign governments will exercise restraint in retaliating.
比如说，我们之所以坚决抵制伊朗的核能军事化，正是因为我们站在欧洲人的立场来考虑问题，而不是因为我们作为美国盟友的身份。	We should, for example, want to prevent the militarization of nuclear energy in Iran precisely because of our concern as Europeans, not because we are allies of the US.
纽约—正在乌克兰逐渐升级的冲突 — — 一方是西方支持的政府，另一方是俄罗斯支持的分裂主义者 — — 让人们开始关注一个根本问题：克里姆林宫的长期目标是什么？	NEW YORK – The escalating conflict in Ukraine between the Western-backed government and Russian-backed separatists has focused attention on a fundamental question: What are the Kremlin’s long-term objectives?
为了更好地做好准备以处理未来流行病，世界必须从现在开始投资于强化公共卫生体系、提高发展中国家的疾病预防能力，并创造灵活的新融资工具。	In order to become better prepared to tackle future pandemics, the world must invest now in strengthening public-health systems, bolstering developing countries’ disease-prevention capacity, and establishing new and flexible financing instruments.
中国还在其邻近东亚的战略利益范围之外实施了一系列外交举措，并积极参与到了2015年伊朗核协定等外交倡议之中。	China has also launched diplomatic initiatives beyond its immediate sphere of strategic interest in East Asia, as well as actively participating in initiatives such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
2011年约23%的地方卫生部门反映公共卫生应急计划数量锐减甚至消失。 还有15%反映2012年也有过类似的削减开支。	Some 23% of local health departments reported that public health preparedness programs were reduced or even eliminated in 2011, while a further 15% reported similar cuts in 2012.
此外，非洲和亚洲的金融技术公司正在寻找创新方式来分析贫困人口活动所产生的数据，并利用相关数据来设计和提供更高质量的银行服务。	Moreover, financial technology firms in Africa and Asia are finding innovative ways to analyze data generated by poor people’s activities, and using that data to design and deliver better banking services.
1996至2001年塔利班统治阿富汗时支持疫苗接种工作，现在态度也并未改变；最新的塔利班声明敦促圣战者为小儿麻痹工作人员提供“一切必要的支持 ” 。	When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, from 1996 to 2001, it supported the vaccination effort, and indeed it continues to do so; a recent Taliban statement urged its Mujahedeen to provide polio workers with “all necessary support.”
事实上，2012年卡塔赫纳（Cartagena）美洲峰会成了一次抨击美国的大会，各国威胁，如果2015年不邀请古巴与会，就抵制峰会。	Indeed, the 2012 Summit of the Americas in Cartagena became an exercise in America-bashing, with countries threatening to boycott the 2015 summit if Cuba was not invited.
否则，勒庞将有望取得胜利，朝着20世纪30年代又进一步 — — 许多国家抛弃国际合作和集体解决共同问题的做法。	The alternative could be a Le Pen victory, and a further step back toward the 1930s, when too many countries turned their back on international cooperation and collective solutions to shared problems.
他们一般投票率更高、更愿意参与公民活动、更倾向于远离犯罪、更好地教育子女、并且因为生活方式更健康而减少患病的几率。	They also tend to vote at higher rates, engage in more civic activities, commit fewer crimes, educate their children better, and get sick less frequently by adopting healthier lifestyles.
而中国那种充满活力，更现代也更全球化的经济与其缺乏透明度的一党执政体制之间的不平衡状态也日益加深，在许多西方专家看来，这种矛盾对立将不可避免地使中国走向危机。	As the imbalance between China’s ever more dynamic, modern, and globalized economy and its opaque, single-party system of political rule deepened, many Western specialists predicted that the contradiction would inevitably trip China up.
今年的大选则在这层分歧之上又加上了更加传统的左右分歧，卷土重来的工党利用了选民对保守党削减预算政策的不满。	This year’s general election superimposed on this a more traditional left-right split, with a resurgent Labour Party capitalizing on voter discontent with Conservative budget cuts.
生物技术加碳捕捉和储存（BECCS）是净零排放这一“过头方针 ” （ overshoot approach）的榜样。	Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage is the poster child for the new “overshoot approach” of net-zero emissions.
这种设计不仅仅是来自于开明的原则，同时也有其必要性：美国需要劝说人们跨越大洋来忍受前线战事以及后来工业化的艰难困苦。	This design was crafted not only from enlightened principle but from necessity: America needed to persuade people to cross the ocean and endure the hardships of the frontier and, later, industrialization.
任职总理期间，我领导的政府曾调查俄罗斯乌克兰能源公司，了解谁是它真正的所有者、它采用什么手段获得了对中亚天然气进口的实际控制权、以及利润最终去了哪里。	During my premiership, my government sought to investigate RosUkrEnergo – to discover who precisely its owners are, how it gained a virtual monopoly on the import of Central Asian gas, and where its profits go.
甚至是那些认为没有证据表明资本账户自由化能促进增长的经济学家，也会常觉得有必要强调“进一步分析”最终可能证实自由市场理论所说的好处一定存在。	Even economists who find no evidence that capital-account liberalization boosts growth often feel obliged to stress that “further analysis” might at last reveal the benefits that free-market theory suggests must exist.
停电越来越频繁、时间越来越长，这表明这个正在经受大规模失业、普遍的排斥感和大量贫困的国家境况还会继续恶化。	More frequent and longer-lasting power outages foretell worse to come in an economy already struggling with mass unemployment, widespread exclusion, and deep pockets of poverty.
1991年苏联解体后，俄罗斯总统叶利钦显然忘了把它要回，于是乌克兰拥有了这块拥有两百万居民、其中近60%认为自己是俄罗斯人的领土。	After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russian President Boris Yeltsin apparently forgot to claim it back, so Ukraine kept a territory in which nearly 60% of the two million inhabitants identify as Russians.
而布什政府却正向伊拉克增派21000名美国士兵，并敦促盟国增兵阿富汗。 美国的盟友们正抵制其中东政策。	Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq, and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America’s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy.
在类似的气候中极端降雨也将变得频繁而且高强度，这是基于另一个简单的物理事实：暖空气可以储藏更多水分。	Extreme rainfall events will also become more frequent and intense in a warmer climate, owing to another simple fact of physics: warm air can hold more moisture.
因此，正如在文化领域的其它方面实行的策略那样，中国政府在很大程度上放弃了对电视内容在道德方面的控制。	Thus, in a strategy mirrored elsewhere in the cultural sphere, the government simply relinquished much control over the moral component of TV content.
巴西利亚—在过去的一年中，大型新兴经济体纷纷因发达国家危机引起欧洲的衰退和美国复苏乏力而遭受重创，特别是上半年。	BRASILIA – Large emerging economies were hit hard in the past year – particularly in the first half – by the crisis in developed countries, with Europe in recession and the United States staging only a meager recovery.
但是北约不断表现韧性并不应该让我们忽视这一事实，也就是它并不再给跨大西洋安全关系提供任何健康的基础。	But NATO’s repeated demonstrations of resilience should not blind us to the fact that it no longer provides a healthy basis for the transatlantic security relationship.
今日，北约26个联盟国的首脑在布鲁塞尔的北约总部齐聚一堂，以展现跨大西洋两岸无以伦比的团结精神，表达他们期待共同行动的决心。	Today, 26 NATO Heads of State and Government will meet at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. They are here to demonstrate a strong spirit of unity in the transatlantic community, a determination to look forward and take action together.
此外大部分风险（即便购买了保险）依然要由日本来承担，而非有效地分散到了外国投资者手中，因此日本依然要独自承受损失。	Moreover, much of that risk, even if insured, continues to be borne in Japan, rather than being spread effectively to foreign investors, so Japan is still alone in bearing the costs.
当时我们就明白，如果掏空民主的价值，把民主降格成“保证”能解决所有问题的政党之间的竞争，这样的民主其实相当不民主。	"We were already certain then that if democracy is emptied of values and reduced to a competition of political parties that have ""guaranteed"" solutions to everything, it can be quite undemocratic."
来自多数民族基库尤族的肯雅塔说，他希望弥合肯尼亚的分歧，这与其前任齐贝吉（Mwai Kibaki）的承诺异曲同工。	Kenyatta, a member of the dominant Kikuyu ethnic group, says that he wants to heal the country’s divisions, echoing the promise of his predecessor, Mwai Kibaki.
在我的书《资本主义4.0 》 （ Capitalism 4.0）中我指出，2008年危机所预兆的第四次全球资本主义系统性崩溃之后也将发生可比的政治剧变。	In my book Capitalism 4.0, I argued that comparable political upheavals would follow the fourth systemic breakdown of global capitalism heralded by the 2008 crisis.
今天，社会党统治集团中的部分人也对叙利亚和神权政治的伊朗及伊斯兰主义的真主党日渐加深的联盟关系而忧心忡忡。	Today, parts of the ruling Ba’ath elite worry about Syria’s deepening alliance with theocratic Iran and Islamist Hezbollah.
但是这很可能会随着公投临近而改变，而风险在于，卡梅隆有可能成为，照丘吉尔的话说，那个在自己的政党和国家之间选择了前者，却最终同时失去了一切的领导人。	But that is likely to change as the vote approaches and the risk grows that he will be remembered as the leader who, to paraphrase Churchill, was given a choice between his party and his country, chose his party, and ended up losing both.
那些在海湾国家当移民的孟加拉国工人带着激进的瓦哈比（Wahhabi）和Salafi所教授的思想回到祖国，愈加地煽风点火。	Bangladeshi migrant workers in the Gulf States who return home imbued with radical Wahhabi and Salafi teachings fan the fires even more.
故事开始于1996年，当时的美国失业率是5.6 % ， 此时商人和投资者发现了互联网，在随后的四年中，投资在信息技术设备和软件的支出直线上升，从2810亿美元增加到4460亿美元。	At the start of 1996, the US unemployment rate was 5.6%. Then America’s businesses and investors discovered the Internet.
服务导向型增长从很多方面来说都能解决“不稳定、不平衡、不协调并最终不可持续”的增长模式 — — 众所周知前总理温家宝批评过这一模式。	Services-led growth is, in many ways, the antidote to the “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and ultimately unsustainable” growth model that former Premier Wen Jiabao’s famously criticized in 2007.
事实上，并购活动 — — 不管是数量还是交易规模 — — 在2008年全球金融危机前十分活跃，包括欧元区内部和之外的跨境并购。	In fact, M&A activity – both the number and size of transactions – was picking up before the 2008 global financial crisis, including across borders within and beyond the eurozone.
多数人眼中更好的教育是接受更多教育；而更高质量教育是指有效地学会技能（比方说像经合组织标准化PISA考试成绩 ） 。	What most people mean by better education is more schooling; and, by higher-quality education, they mean the effective acquisition of skills (as revealed, say, by the test scores in the OECD’s standardized PISA exam).
由于许多最好的新思想和创新都来自小公司而不是老牌大型企业，当前持续的信用紧缩必将导致长期增长成本的产生。	Since many of the best ideas and innovations come from small companies rather than large, established firms, the ongoing credit contraction will inevitably have long-term growth costs.
最新日本海上安保厅（Japanese Coastguard）数据表明，中国进入东海钓鱼岛地区的次数大幅下降。	Recent Japanese Coastguard data indicate a drastic reduction in Chinese incursions into the Senkaku/Diaoyu area in the East China Sea.
结果，这些国家把自己推向了持续紧缩、低增长和高债务，同时又切断了所有让私人债权人对主权债务人施加财政纪律的未来激励。	As a result, these countries have condemned themselves to continued austerity, low growth, and high debt, while diminishing any future incentive for private lenders to impose fiscal discipline on sovereign borrowers.
然而莫迪没有做出任何表示平息支持者或安抚批评者，这让投资者 — — 特别是外国投资者 — — 担心他是否有能力管好自己的选民。	Yet Modi has said nothing to quiet his supporters or mollify his critics, raising concerns among investors – especially foreigners – about his ability to manage his own constituents.
为了保证美国和泛美开发银行成员国实践他们对发展和人权的承诺，海地人民和美国的纳税人应该拥有一个将泛美开发银行贷款以及在海地的项目的状况向公众公开的制度。	The people of Haiti, as well as US taxpayers, deserve a system that makes public the status of IDB loans and projects in Haiti in order to ensure that the US and IDB member states uphold their commitments to development and human rights.
在世界银行六大管理指标中，中国在“法制力度”上近几年也呈下滑趋势，从1998年的-0.28降至2005年的-0.47，在这一类中的208个国家中列第124位。	Indeed, among the World Bank’s six “Governance Indicators,” China’s score on the “Rule of Law” index has also slid in recent years, from -0.28 in 1998 to -0.47 in 2005, when China ranked 124th out of 208 countries in this category.
极权主义统治下的生活是一种极端的状况，它要求我们对所有深受其折磨的受害者都适用特殊的、有细微差别的规则。	Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special, nuanced rules to all the captives of that ordeal.
国民议会可以按照宪法规定任命新一届政府，而新政府反过来又可以邀请包括拉美、北美和欧洲国家在内的自愿联盟提供军事协作。	The Assembly could constitutionally appoint a new government, which in turn could request military assistance from a coalition of the willing, including Latin American, North American, and European countries.
如果如果劳动者无法自由流动的话，财政转移支付就是欧元区缓解债务偿付压力，以及通过刺激经济活动来促进就业的唯一选项。	Without free labor mobility, fiscal transfers are the eurozone’s only option to ease debt repayment and, by stimulating economic activity, boost employment.
已故历史学家菲利普·科廷（Philip Curtin）指出，从一千年前人类刚刚进入城市时期开始，典型的贸易活动就已经包括了商人与外族人混居的网络。	As the late historian Philip Curtin documented, from the beginning of urban life, millennia ago, trade typically involved networks of co-ethnic merchants living among aliens.
欧盟的建立本是为了打破欧洲民族主义的破坏性循环 — — 导致两次世界大战的两大极权制度的崛起都是拜这一循环所赐 — — 后来它也成为人类世界秩序的样板。	The EU, established to break the destructive cycle of European nationalism that had facilitated the rise of two totalitarian systems and caused two world wars, amounted to the creation of a prototype of a humane world order.
按计划，哈萨克燃料银行将在2017年开张营业，它将储存90吨低浓缩铀，足以为三个典型的发电用轻水反应堆提供燃料补给。	Scheduled to commence operations in 2017, the Kazakh fuel bank will store up to 90 tons of LEU, sufficient to refuel three typical power-producing light water reactors.
当中国经济增长时，它从其他国家大量进口，强有力地提振了全球经济。 2004年到2006年，2009年至2010年，还有2017年，中国经济的快速增长都推动了世界经济的发展。	The reason, Northwestern University’s Robert Gordon says, is that despite the promise of modern technologies, ever-slower productivity growth has dragged down the growth potential of these rich economies.
但更重要的是，43%的非洲人将上升至中上阶层， 而该数据在2013年仅为39.6 % ， 而这意味着对商品和服务的需求将大幅增加。	But, more important, 43% of Africans will belong to the middle or upper classes, up from 39.6% in 2013, implying considerably higher demand for goods and services.
在1922年的论文《沉闷的科学 》 （ The Dismal Science）中，蒙肯（H.L. Mencken）解释了为何经济学家会忽视全球化可能给美国这样的发达经济体所造成的负面社会影响。	In his 1922 essay “The Dismal Science,” H.L. Mencken suggested why economists would ignore the negative social effects that globalization can have on an advanced economy such as the US.
自独立以来的50年里，有724万个工作被创造出来，增长率为261 % ， 约等于在美国创造了1.05亿份工作。	In the 50 years since independence, 7.24 million jobs have been created, an increase of 261%, which would be equivalent to the creation of 105 million jobs in the United States.
但反对该协定也许是目前剩下的美国总统候选人唯一达成共识的问题，而加拿大贸易部长也对该协定表示严重保留。	But opposition to the agreement may be the only issue that the remaining US presidential candidates can agree on, and Canada’s trade minister has expressed serious reservations about it.
2000年开始的联合国千年发展目标将在2015年12月到期，这意味着实现全民普及小学教育的目标正在快速接近最后期限。	The UN Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, expire in December 2015, which means that time is running to meet the deadline for achieving the target of universal primary education.
比方说，莱因哈特和罗格夫可能故意对自己的研究成果轻描淡写（他们实际也是这样做的 ） ， 以防止它们被赤字鹰派所利用。	For example, Reinhart and Rogoff might have downplayed their results – such as they were – in order to prevent them from being misused by deficit hawks.
你还可以否认杀手与恐怖组织有涉；伊斯兰国直到杀手本人在行凶途中宣布效忠、从而给他的行动贴上了标签后才宣布对此事件负责。	One can also dismiss the killer’s connection to terror groups; the Islamic State (ISIS) did not own the incident until after the killer himself, in the midst of the attack, pledged his allegiance and thus put a label on his actions.
据IMF研究，到2021年，美国净投资头寸可能会进一步恶化 — — 预计净负债从占GDP的41%上升到63 % — —而中国净投资头寸盈余将基本保持不变。	According to the IMF, by 2021, the US net investment position will probably deteriorate – with net liabilities rising from of 41% of GDP to 63% – while China’s net investment position remains flat.
但在国内，那些小规模而且独特的法国商业 — — 奶酪生产商，法式蛋糕店或者法国餐厅 — — 却被高税率和社会福利支出压得喘不过气来，另一边，那些销售“亚洲制造”的超级市场却生意兴隆。	At home, meanwhile, small, distinctively French businesses – cheese makers, patisseries, or restaurateurs – get hammered by heavy taxes and social-welfare costs while supermarkets flourish selling products from Asia.
尽管如此，它建立了一个可靠的框架阻止伊朗在未来10—15年制造核武器 — — 而这是一个非常积极的结果。	Nonetheless, it creates a solid framework to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons for the next 10-15 years – and that is a very positive development.
显然，我们需要一个更加合作性的战略。 我们认为，基于专利保护和执行机制的跨境技术交换框架能够释放发达和发展中经济体的创造力。	Clearly, a more cooperative strategy is needed.We believe that a framework of cross-border technological exchange based on patent protection and enforcement mechanisms can release the creativity of developed and developing economies alike.
任何将精灵捉回瓶子中的尝试不但可能触发贸易战，对经济增长造成 严重后果，也无法让贸易退回到50年前的水平。	Any effort to put the genie back in the bottle might not only trigger trade wars, with serious consequences for economic growth, but would also fail to reduce trade to the levels of 50 years ago.
我们西方可能急需俄罗斯的能源，但如果俄罗斯不想在未来蜕变为东方式的专制，它就必须满怀诚意与西方接触。	We in the West may badly need Russia’s energy, but if Russia does not want its future to degenerate into Oriental despotism, it must engage with the West in good faith.
他用最好、做高尚的方式描述了民主，民主应该如此，但并不总是如此：自动发动起来的人们能够也愿意改变自己的命运。	He was describing democracy at its best, its most noble, as it should be, but not always is: freely mobilized men and women able and willing to change the course of their destiny.
欧洲、北美和亚洲民族主义、民粹主义和本地主义政党的刑期正在导致针对自由贸易和劳动力迁徙的阻挠斗争，而这将进一步削弱全球增长。	If anything, the rise of nationalistic, populist, and nativist parties in Europe, North America, and Asia is leading to a backlash against free trade and labor migration, which could further weaken global growth.
面对如此显而易见的恢复力，在近几年中将全球增长描述为“新平庸 ” （ new mediocre）的国际货币基金组织（IMF ） ， 最近修正了其世界经济展望。	In response to this apparent resilience, the International Monetary Fund, which in recent years had characterized global growth as the “new mediocre,” recently upgraded its World Economic Outlook.
而如今人们则需要求助于气候经济学家来指点一下那些针对全球变暖的不同应对措施所可能带来的效益，成本以及可能引起的后果。	Now we need to turn to climate economists to enlighten us about the benefits, costs, and possible outcomes from different responses to this challenge.
比如希腊和意大利就一直试图通过给零售现金使用额设定上限（分别为1500和1000欧元）来遏制现金使用。	For example, Greece and Italy have been trying to discourage cash use by capping retail cash purchases (at €1,500 and €1,000, respectively).
在这一技术跨越之下，发展中国家的贫困民众无需花大价钱购买固定电话以及其他基础设施就可获得长途通信服务。	In a clear case of technological leapfrogging, they have given poor people in developing countries access to long-distance communications without the need for costly investments in landlines and other infrastructure.
整个欧洲社会模式的多元化，以及就共同规则达成一致的困难性，将成为一体化的节奏和范围的天然“刹车 ” 。	The diversity of social models across Europe, and the difficulty of reaching agreement on common rules, would have acted as a natural brake on the pace and scope of integration.
美国流向墨西哥的人口比反过来更多；如果说美国有什么需要的话，也是更多的新来者以填补劳动力短缺，特别是看护行业。	More people move from the US to Mexico than the other way around; if anything, the US needs more newcomers to help make up for labor shortages, particularly in the care sector.
说来凑巧，像肯尼思·罗格夫、拉里·萨默斯和彼得·沙德这样的著名观察家认为美国甚至应逐步淘汰100美元的钞票。	As it happens, such prominent observers as Kenneth Rogoff, Larry Summers, and Peter Sands think the US should even phase out $100 bills, too.
从亚历山大大帝时代到斯大林的冷血时代，统治者以各种形式实施此类策略，使人民臣服于他从而达到其个人意愿。	From Alexander the Great to Stalin the Cruel, variants of that strategy have been used to keep nations in thrall to the will of an emperor.
塞尔维亚总理（当时任总统）伊斯拉夫·科什图尼察2001年成立真相委员会的企图从一开始就被指控为缺乏公正，成立起来的真相委员会也不到一年就遭到解散的厄运。	Serbian Prime Minister (then President) Vojislav Kostunica’s attempt in 2001 to set up a truth commission was doomed from the outset by allegations of bias, and was disbanded within a year.
美国也许看到了复苏强化的信号，但欧元区仍有步日本衰退后尘的危险，而新兴市场也在担忧出口拉动增长战略使使它们极易受国外停滞的影响。	The United States may be seeing signs of a strengthening recovery, but the eurozone risks following Japan into recession, and emerging markets worry that their export-led growth strategies have left them vulnerable to stagnation abroad.
现在，应该有一个效仿法国总统马克龙的“共和国前进 ” （ La République En Marche）的新政党，利用老牌政党的分裂、混乱和失信。	Now is the moment for a new party, styled after French President Emmanuel Macron’s “La République En Marche,” to capitalize on the division, disarray, and distrust in the established parties.
对最昂贵项目 — — 实施绿色能源体系、建设交通基础设施以及开发现代城市 — — 的融资必须来自外国机构投资者。	Financing for the most expensive projects – implementing green-energy systems, building transport infrastructure, and developing modern cities – must come from foreign institutional investors.
而在没有中国参与的情况下商讨这些规章可被视为是旨在最终诱使中国进入一个自由化全球体系的某一部分策略。	Negotiating these rules without China’s participation can be viewed as part of a strategy aimed at eventually coaxing China into a liberal global system.
理由很简单，所有经济体内部都有贷款者和存款者，而借款成本（或者储蓄回报）的变动会对他们造成不一样的影响。	The argument is simple: All economies have both borrowers and savers, and changes in the cost of borrowing (or the return to saving) affect them differently.
回到宏观层面，中国需要在各级政府间重新分配责任和资源，以利用它们在提供服务和筹集收入方面的比较优势。	Back at the macro level, China needs to reallocate responsibilities and resources among the various levels of government, in order to capitalize on their comparative advantage in providing services and raising revenue.
在可能导致物价上升并在某些情况下引发更严重就业不安全感的整个报复阶段，政府都得将本已分裂的美国公众拧成一股绳。	A divided US public will need to be kept on board throughout the retaliatory phase, which will lead to higher prices and, in some cases, greater job insecurity.
换句话说，目前希腊能够为其当前水平的消费和投资（包括政府和私人支出）融资，不需要依靠来自世界其他部分的资本流入。	Stated differently, Greece is now able to finance its current level of consumption and investment, including government and private spending, without relying on capital inflows from the rest of the world.
值得注意的是，我还收获了来自自然科学专业人士的评论，表示民众对专家信任度越来越低的现象在他们的学科领域也普遍存在着。	Remarkably, I also received comments from professionals in the natural sciences who said that citizens’ growing distrust of experts was pervasive in their disciplines, too.
至于马来西亚，已经出现了与出口部门强迫劳工有关的问题 — — 在TPP协议签订前应该充分履行劳动标准。	As for Malaysia, important issues regarding forced labor in the export sector have emerged – and there should be full compliance with labor standards before the TPP deal is signed.
即便如此，历史的教训也告诉我们：仅仅需要一部授权法就能够动摇法治，并代之以意识形态上的独裁，希特勒在德国掌权就是最好的例子。	Even then, we know from history that it takes but one Enabling Law to unhinge the rule of law and replace it by an ideological tyranny, as happened when Hitler came to power in Germany.
比方说，在1990到2010年间年均降低5.6%之后，叙利亚的婴儿死亡率近年来已经增长了9.3 % 。	For example, after declining at an average annual rate of 5.6% between 1990 and 2010, Syria’s infant mortality rate has risen by 9.3% in recent years.
他粗俗地用大屠杀隐喻描绘伊朗威胁，看上去他更像是眼看就要被激动的暴徒袭击的犹太居民区长老，而不像是中东最强大国家的总理。	In his vulgar use of Holocaust metaphors to portray the Iranian threat, he sounds more like the principal of a Jewish ghetto about to be annihilated by an agitated mob than the prime minister of the most powerful country in the Middle East.
阿姆斯特丹—最新的经济数据表明，大多数发达经济体正在重新陷入衰退，金融市场正在承受自2008年雷曼兄弟倒闭以来最大的压力。	AMSTERDAM – The latest economic data suggests that recession is returning to most advanced economies, with financial markets now reaching levels of stress unseen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
联合国难民事务高级专员公署和国际移民组织都能够从加强多边支持中受益，而G20拥有独特的优势完成这项任务。	Both the UNHCR and the IOM could benefit from stronger multilateral support, and the G20 is uniquely poised to offer it.
米歇尔·奥巴马刻意冷静地表明，各部部长如果不是比政策制定者更好更重要的话，也是一样的好，一样的重要。	She is deliberately, coolly signaling that secretaries are just as good and important as policy makers, if not more so.
另有一次，囚室没有通风，室温高达100华氏度，被囚者躺在地上几乎失去知觉，旁边还有一堆头发 — “ 很明显，他整夜都在抓扯着自己的头发 。 ”	On another occasion the room was unventilated, the temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the detainee was almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next to him – “he had apparently been pulling it out throughout the night.”
但跟伊朗伊斯兰共和国的缔造者阿亚图拉鲁霍拉·霍梅尼不一样的是，哈梅内伊既缺乏强大的个人魅力，也没有深厚的学养。	Unlike the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Khamenei lacks charisma and deep learning.
IMF以此表明对人民币继续崛起的信心，也增强了人民币迈向国际化的全球预期 — — 并给与了间接支持。	By demonstrating its confidence in the renminbi’s continued rise, the IMF has reinforced global expectations of – and lent implicit support to – the renminbi’s progress toward internationalization.
由西班牙和土耳其政府共同启动的文明联盟（Alliance of Civilizations）项目就是其中一个范例。	The Alliance of Civilizations, begun by Spain and Turkey, is one example.
毕竟，据报他根本无法吸收全面、有组织的政策简报，而他的意见总是与最后一位与他交谈者的意见有许多相似之处。	After all, he is reportedly unable to absorb comprehensive, organized policy briefings, and his opinions tend to reflect those of whomever he spoke to last.
但在危机后的经济下行区间，累积的债务就会起到一个强大的遏制作用，因为过度杠杆化的企业和消费者都减少投资和消费以偿还贷款。	But in the post-crisis downswing, accumulated debts have a powerful depressive effect, because over-leveraged businesses and consumers cut investment and consumption in an attempt to pay down their debts.
普京借此时机重复他的论调 — — “俄罗斯正在发展自己的民主 ” — —与此同时他却拒绝了波罗的海国家的要求，他们要俄罗斯交待它在二战末期与希特勒达成入侵这些国家的交易的内幕。	Putin took that occasion to repeat his political mantra – “Russia is developing it’s own brand of democracy” – while spurning requests from the Baltic countries that Russia come clean about its deal with Hitler to devour them on WWII’s eve.
在获得最低工资的工人中，一半以上是妇女，其中许多人的大部分收入来源是小费，因为政府允许餐馆支付令人震惊的2.13美元/小时最低工资。	Among workers earning the minimum wage, more than half are women, and many of them depend on tipping for the bulk of their income, as restaurants are permitted to pay a shockingly low minimum wage of $2.13 per hour.
我们确实看到，一些印度企业巨头，如塔塔（Tata）和阿达尼（Adani）集团，也想从豁免电力部门贷款的计划中获益。	We do know that some of India’s business heavyweights, such as the Tata and Adani groups, are also hoping to benefit from a plan to forgive power-sector loans.
比如，老布什总统从来不做“远在天边的事 ” ， 但其踏实的管理和执行打造了美国过去50年中最成功的外交日程。	Consider President George H.W. Bush, who did not do “the vision thing,” but whose sound management and execution underpinned one of the most successful US foreign-policy agendas of the past half-century.
我们强调社会被两股政治裂痕所割裂：将少数人和种族、宗教或意识形态多数人分开的身份裂痕；以及将富人和其他人分开的财富差距。	We emphasize that societies are divided by two potential cleavages: an identity split that separates a minority from the ethnic, religious, or ideological majority, and a wealth gap that pits the rich against the rest of society.
类似地，我们可以看到俄罗斯产民用飞机在国际公司和合作下进入全球市场，特别是那些可以在先进ICT设备上与俄罗斯公司合作的企业。	Similarly, we might see new Russian-built civilian aircraft entering the global market in partnership with international firms, especially those that can work with Russian companies on advanced ICT avionics.
尽管如此，从整体看，有理由期待让穷人获得知识和与世界各地人们取得联系的可能性将以十分积极的形式推动社会变迁。	On the whole, though, it is reasonable to expect that giving poor people access to knowledge and the possibility of connecting with people anywhere in the world will be socially transforming in a very positive way.
这世界上的任何事都得来不易：如果欧盟不能管理一个多文化的欧洲社会，那么它就应该准备好应对永久的停滞。	Nothing comes easy in this world: if the Union cannot manage a multicultural society in Europe, then it ought to prepare itself for permanent stagnation.
即便如此，在政府和支持政府并从中获益的政要切实致力于民主、善政和法治、并对国内民众负责之前，政变都将作为一种可行的选择。	Yet, until governments – and the elites that support and benefit from them – are prepared to commit to democracy, good governance, and the rule of law, and until they are accountable to their populations, coups will remain a viable option.
20世纪，美国取而代之，建立美国统治下的和平（Pax Americana ） ， 向西欧、亚洲、中东和拉美的广大地域提供安全保障。	In the twentieth century, the United States took over that role, imposing its Pax Americana to provide security to most of Western Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.
两年前，一位艾滋病毒测试呈阳性的尼日利亚男青年在Facebook上与我联系，向我讲述了他每个月在诊所经受的折磨。	Two years ago, a young HIV-positive Nigerian man contacted me on Facebook to tell me about his monthly ordeal at the clinic.
跑步等运动相对来说成本较低，但其他运动 — — 包括体操、游泳，以及比它们更甚的团队运动和马术 — — 要求巨大的资源投入。	While sports like running are relatively inexpensive, others – including gymnastics, swimming, and even more so team games and equestrian events – require significant resources.
对于像苏格兰这样的新成立的主权国家，市场免不了会要求利率溢价，通过发行英镑债券能够让这一溢价最小化，从而保护投资者免遭贬值风险。	The interest-rate premium that the market would inevitably demand from a young sovereign like Scotland could be minimized by issuing debt in sterling, thereby protecting investors from additional devaluation risk.
结果就是，不仅仅是卢武铉悲剧性的自杀和金正日无用的炮火。 日益增长的朝鲜族内部国家的对立斗争会最终危及整个朝鲜族人民的安全。	As a result, growing inter-Korean hostility may ultimately prove far more lethal to the well-being of all Koreans than Roh Moo-hyun’s tragic suicide and Kim Jong-il’s futile fireworks.
此外，伊斯兰正义和发展党在土耳其选民中拥有广泛的支持，并且在经济发展、人权立法和改善土耳其库尔德少数民族的待遇等问题上都表现得非常出色。	Moreover, the AKP has broad support among Turkish voters and an admirable record of economic growth, human rights legislation, and improvement in the treatment of Turkey’s Kurdish minority.
因为金正日真正想要的并非和平，而是所谓“和平攻势 ” — —某种自1953年停战以来就屡试不爽的伎俩，目的就是为了破坏和瓦解对方阵营的团结。	For what Kim is now offering is not peace, but a “peace offensive” – a tactic used by the North repeatedly since the armistice of 1953 in order to sow division whenever the regime’s adversaries have demonstrated unity and resolve.
少数商品丰富国 — — 如博茨瓦纳、智利和挪威 — — 成功地抵制了资源魔咒，但也没能实现经济的多元化，仍然依赖于基于自然资源的出口。	While a handful of commodity-rich countries have managed to buck the curse, including Botswana, Chile, and Norway, they have, nevertheless, failed to diversify their economies, remaining dependent on natural resource-based exports.
“只要我们购买中国制造的产品 ， ” 他在去年讨论美国及其盟友时写道 ， “ 作为消费者的我们就在资助中国构建用于伤害我们和我们的国家的军事力量 。 ”	“Whenever we buy products made in China,” he wrote last year of the US and its allies, “we as consumers are helping to finance a Chinese military buildup that may well mean to do us and our countries harm.”
法国和德国拥有可跻身二十世纪最伟大政治家行列的戴高乐和阿登纳，他们能够拨开琐碎政治的迷雾，认清历史大势。	In Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, France and Germany had two of the twentieth century’s greatest statesmen, leaders who were able to discern the broad sweep of history through the fog of quotidian politics.
俄亥俄州的罗伯·波特曼（Rob Portman）甚至担任过小布什总统的白宫行政和预算管理局（Office of Management and Budget）主任。	Rob Portman of Ohio even served as Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under President George W Bush.
华盛顿特区 - - 当全球与二战后最为严重的金融危机斗争的时候，人们把注意力集中到了受到直接影响的发达国家和新兴市场经济体。	WASHINGTON, DC – As the world struggles with the most serious financial turmoil of the post-war era, attention has focused on the advanced and emerging-market economies most immediately affected.
社会学家安东尼·吉登斯所谓的“梦游式情景”几乎丝毫不差地在英国上演，英国在从未对所涉利益进行真正诚实和明智辩论的情况下决意退出欧盟。	Following literally what the sociologist Anthony Giddens called the “sleepwalking scenario,” the UK decided to abandon the EU without a truly honest and informed debate about what was at stake.
英国领导人必须认识到，当产业战略是为了提振退欧后的增长，那么也许需要在欧盟关税提高的前提下制定。 欧盟将仍然是英国的主要市场。	UK leaders must recognize that, where the strategy is aimed at strengthening post-Brexit growth, it will probably have to be set in the context of higher tariffs vis-à-vis the EU, which would remain Britain’s main market.
与此同时，他们应该解决欧洲长期竞争力的诸项重大威胁，包括生产率低下、内部市场不完善以及创新不充分等。	At the same time, they should tackle other major threats to Europe’s long-term competitiveness, including low productivity, an incomplete internal market, and insufficient innovation.
其次，我们在中期目标的指导下保持着稳定的货币政策，避免了对若干指数变化做出过于简单的判断和机械的反应。	Second, we kept a steady hand, guided by our medium-term orientation, while eschewing oversimplified diagnostics and mechanistic reactions to a few indicators.
气候变化曾被描绘成一场损失高达全球GDP20%的巨型灾难，虽然勇气可嘉的政要们称能用1%的GDP解决这一问题。	Climate change has been portrayed as a huge catastrophe costing as much as 20% of world GDP, though brave politicians could counter it at a cost of just 1% of GDP.
金融部门得到的补贴之巨令人咋舌，在现行政策下，补贴还将进一步增加 — — 这些补贴的首要作用是支持了最发达国家最高端1%人群的生活方式。	The extent of subsidies in this sector is stunning and, under current policies, will only increase over time – thereby primarily supporting the lifestyles of the top 1% of people in very rich countries.
虽然民主未列入他的议程，但他的言论及其追随者在国内不断制造的武装冲突毫无疑问是要瓦解当朝政权的合法性。	While democracy is not part of his agenda, his messages, as well as his followers’ periodic armed attacks inside the country, have no doubt contributed to the erosion of the regime’s legitimacy.
中国人民银行降低基准政策利率的措施彰显出中国政府对稳定政策的战术性关注。 中国政府将GDP增长下限定在7%左右。	By cutting its benchmark policy interest rates on November 21, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has underscored the tactical focus of the government’s stabilization policy, which aims to put a floor of around 7% on GDP growth.
还有其他克里姆林宫支持者，包括那些想照旧与俄罗斯做生意的公司领袖以及那些为苏联做辩护的学者，在苏联解体25年后，他们终于看到了正名的机会。	There are other Kremlin supporters as well, including corporate leaders who want to return to business as usual with Russia, and academic apologists for the Soviet Union who, 25 years after its collapse, see a chance for vindication.
这个小集团很快扩展到7个国家，后来又增加了议事范围和成员 — — 加入了俄罗斯以及一套庞大的官僚执行和宣传机构 — — 并最终形成了G8.	The group soon grew to seven, and later broadened in scope and membership – including Russia and a vast bureaucratic and press apparatus – to become the G-8.
但即便最精巧的布局计划也需要大量资源来实现，正如如果不是得到各界慷慨解囊，科布瓦斯非洲变革国际青年组织可能依然只是一纸空文。	But executing even the best-laid plans requires significant resources, and CIYOTA would still be an idea were it not for the generosity of others.
它们也倾向于更快地发展以及更加多元化，这不仅是因为坐拥更大的国内市场，同时也由于拥有更多元化的产品可以出售给其他国家和城市。	They tend to grow faster and become even more diversified, not only because they have a larger internal market, but also because they are more diversified in terms of what they can sell to other cities and countries.
其后果已经开始显露：据2016年彭博创新指数，美国现在是世界上创新力第八的国家，比2015年的排名下降了两位。	The consequences are already starting to show: according to the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index, the US is now the world’s eighth most innovative country, having fallen two spots since 2015.
但人们对流氓科学家会利用运动员、或运动员会参加基因转移试验，以便获得无法预知的成绩提高的忧心与恐惧都是切实存在的。	But the fear that rogue scientists will take advantage of athletes – or that athletes will seek to enroll in gene-transfer experiments in an attempt to receive some undetectable performance benefit – is very real.
它被定义为“蓄意整体或部分消灭某一民族、人种，种族或宗教团体的行动 ” ， 而其重点则是“蓄意”而非被杀害者的数目。	It refers to “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.” The emphasis is on “intent,” not on the numbers of people whose lives are destroyed.
发自新德里 — — 不知西方在干涉利比亚过程中的所产生“使命偏离效应 ” （ mission creep，意指行动偏离原定目标）是否会无意中在欧洲的南大门外孕育出一个伊斯兰圣战大本营呢？	NEW DELHI – Will “mission creep” in the West’s intervention in Libya end up creating, inadvertently, a jihadist citadel at Europe’s southern doorstep?
相反，他很可能将提出用中国在朝鲜问题上的合作来换取美国停止在韩国部署末段高空区域防御（即萨德）反导系统。	Instead, he will probably offer China’s cooperation in exchange for the US halting its deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea.
事实上，尽管比一些美国州低（如加州的公司税率高达40 % ） ，但日本公司税率高于德国（25 % ） 、中国（24 % ） 、韩国（24 % ） 、英国（24 % ） 和新加坡（17 % ） 。	Indeed, while it remains lower than in some US states (California’s rate, for example, stands at 40%), it exceeds the rates applied in Germany (25%), China (24%), South Korea (24%), the United Kingdom (24%), and Singapore (17%).
在美国，反型脂肪的消费占总能量摄入的2-4 % ， 主要来源是深度油炸的快餐、糕点（包括蛋糕、饼干、松饼、馅饼等 ） 、 包装小食品、人造黄油和面包。	In the US, consumption of trans fats averages between 2-4% of total energy, with major sources being deep fried fast foods, bakery products (cakes, cookies, muffins, pies, etc.), packaged snack foods, margarines, and breads.
然而该国花了18年的时间来迷惑监督机构“国际原子能组织”派出的调查员，以致有的国家认为伊朗已经自毁信誉，放弃了在本国土地上发展铀浓缩的权利。	But it spent 18 years deceiving inspectors from the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency, leading some countries to argue that Iran destroyed its credibility and forfeited its rights to enrichment on its own soil.
我们同时也就德涅斯特河沿岸（Transdniestria）地区的独立问题重新启动了谈判，而唯一能达成解决方案的基础就是令摩尔多瓦在经济和政治上更具吸引力，从而吸引该地区居民倒向摩尔多瓦。	We have also re-launched settlement talks concerning the breakaway region of Transdniestria, where the only viable basis for a solution is to make Moldova ever more economically and politically attractive to the region’s residents.
不管特朗普如何忙于准备入主白宫 — — 遴选内阁、给他的诸多承诺排定顺序 — — 他都不能忽视这一风险。	However busy Trump is planning the transition to the White House – selecting his cabinet and prioritizing his many promises – he must not ignore this risk.
随着世界各国政府和人民越来越意识到中国可以用自己巨大的财富买来影响力之时，一场反华运动是否已经无法避免？	As governments and citizens around the world become aware of the influence that China can buy with its deep pockets, is an anti-Chinese backlash inevitable?
7月9日，被外界称之为“伊斯兰国家”的武装组织在伊拉克摩苏尔大学得到了40千克（合88磅）铀化合物。	On July 9, the militant group now known as the Islamic State captured 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of uranium compounds at Mosul University in Iraq.
另一方面，如果卡斯特罗真的没有前来，那么一些ALBA国家，包括两个哥伦比亚希望改善关系的邻国（厄瓜多尔和委内瑞拉）可能也不会来了。	If, on the other hand, Castro did not attend, some of the ALBA members, including two neighbors with which Colombia hopes to improve relations – Ecuador and Venezuela – might not show up, either.
毫不奇怪，当最近市场跌幅达到20%时，很多人不知道情况可能有多糟糕 — — 也不知道新衰退恐慌是否会成为自我实现的预言。	No wonder that once the recent market drop hit 20%, many people wondered how much worse it could get – and whether fears of a new recession could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
你想必也没有忘记安德鲁·威廉·梅隆（Andrew William Mellon）的鲁莽的著名建议：在大萧条前夕，他建议美国总统胡佛“出清劳动力，出清存货，出清农民，出清房地产 。 ”	And one should not forget Andrew William Mellon’s infamous and reckless advice to former US President Herbert Hoover on the eve of the Great Depression: “liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate.”
发自莫斯科 — — 最近，萦绕在我脑际的总是我的曾祖父尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫，我猜首先挑动我思绪的也许是他同尼克松总统的所谓“厨房辩论”刚好过去了整整50周年。	MOSCOW – My great-grandfather, Nikita Khrushchev, has been on my mind recently. I suppose it was the 50th anniversary of the so-called “kitchen debate” which he held with Richard Nixon that first triggered my memories.
如今，生活在波哥大、蒙得维的亚、圣保罗或圣地亚哥市郊的中产阶级，他们的平均收入（美元值）仍远低于北美或欧洲。	Today, a middle-class family living on the outskirts of Bogotá, Montevideo, São Paulo, or Santiago has an average income that is much lower in dollar terms than that of its counterparts in North America or Europe.
根据世界银行的数据，每年都有500万新增15岁以上人口，而15岁是“告别童年，进入成年的门槛 ” 。	According to the World Bank, each year an additional five million turn 15, “crossing the threshold from childhood to adulthood.”
但虽然当前情况属于技术性通货紧缩 — — 也就是，持续的价格水平下降，并可能在就业或其他合同上体现出来 — — 但并非结构性通缩。	But while what is happening is technically deflation – that is, sustained price-level decreases that may be reflected in employment or other contracts – it is not structural deflation.
但这需要释放更多信贷 — — 而专注于清理现有坏账、强迫银行行为审慎化的央行对这一要求多次不予理会。	But this would require the release of more credit – a condition that the central bank, focused on cleaning up existing bad debts and forcing banks to act more prudently, has repeatedly disregarded.
在1958年的医学伦理和法律教材上，另一位名医写道 ， “ 隐瞒一些情况在临床上常常能收获奇效并且符合患者的利益 。 ”	In a 1958 textbook on medical ethics and law, another eminent doctor stated that it is “often clinically wise and in the patient’s interest to withhold certain matters.”
他明白，领导岗位通常根据个人关系而非能力分配，并且是终身制，整套体制因为效率低下、不愿冒险、缺乏专业能力而举步维艰。	With leadership positions allocated – often for life – on the basis of personal connections, rather than merit, he understood that the system suffered from gross inefficiency, risk aversion, and a lack of technical expertise.
换言之，在过去的30年里，富国似乎已经实现了“可持续发展 ” ， 而穷国（除中国外）的经济发展却是不可持续的。	In other words, during the past three decades the rich world seems to have enjoyed “sustainable development,” while development in the poor world (barring China) has been unsustainable.
特别是，美国与印度的关系一直在经历蒂勒森所谓的“重大转变 ” ， 两国“日益成为在战略上越来越趋同的全球合作伙伴 ” 。	America’s relationship with India, in particular, has been undergoing what Tillerson called a “profound transformation,” as the two countries become “increasingly global partners with growing strategic convergence.”
在这个例子中，这份威胁导致发布者被捕 — — 很多人希望这样的结果能够阻止社交媒体“直男癌”继续发出这样的威胁。	In that case, the threat led to the arrest of its issuer – an outcome that many hope will discourage future such threats from social-media misogynists.
我们将继续与土耳其国内的恐怖主义祸害作斗争，与此同时，我们呼吁所有国家不但要为巴黎死难者致哀，更要拒绝任何形式的恐怖主义。	As we continue to fight the scourge of terrorism in our country, we call on all countries not only to mourn the dead in Paris, but to reject terrorism in all of its forms.

寻求共识、避免煽动、追求增量从而实现可持续发展 — — 上述目标听起来似乎都不是那么伟大，但却深刻而且合乎道德。	Seeking consensus, avoiding demagoguery, pursuing incremental and, therefore, sustainable solutions – none of that sounds terribly epic, but it is profoundly moral.
当利物浦和曼彻斯特铁路线终于在1830年开通时，它带来了一场革命性的胜利，不仅开启了蒸汽时代，而且以人们从未预见的方式改变了世界。	When the L&M Railway eventually opened in 1830, it was a revolutionary success, kickstarting the age of steam and changing the world in ways that could not have been foreseen.
采用最佳的施工方法可以释放出巨额价值：目前的状况是，类似项目的标价在不同国家可以相差50%到100%之多。	Meeting best practices could unlock huge value: as it stands, the price tags for similar projects can vary by 50-100% from country to country.
事实上，邵德家族的第三和第四代不仅在政治和宗教从属上存在分歧，年龄跨度也很大，从20岁至90岁不等。	Indeed, the Al Saud clan’s third and fourth generations are divided not only in political and religious affiliation, but also range in age from 20 to 90 years old.
2017年，国际资金达到了11亿美元，但仍比实施消灭结核病全球计划（Global Plan to End TB）所需要的15亿美元相差不少。	While international funding reached $1.1 billion in 2017, this was recognized to be $1.5 billion short of what is needed to enact the Global Plan to End TB.
这种古老的 — — 但却难以诊断的疾病就会在无意中由诸如一个无症状的生态旅行家这样简单的人或物带进哥斯达黎加。	This debilitating – and difficult to diagnose – illness could thus be introduced to Costa Rica inadvertently by something as simple as an asymptomatic eco-tourist.
但特朗普和内塔尼亚胡相互助长对方的鹰派立场，仍然拒绝接受世界其他国家眼中两国方案这一任何真正协议的基本前提。	But Trump and Netanyahu, feeding each other’s hawkishness, both remain unwilling to accept what the rest of the world views as the basic premise of any good deal: a two-state solution.
“当今最有用的公民权形式 ， ” 一位分析师向她呛声 ， “ 就是不但要致力于伯克希尔教区的福祉，也要致力于整个地球的福祉 。 ”	“The most useful form of citizenship these days,” one analyst lectured her, “is one dedicated not only to the wellbeing of a Berkshire parish, say, but to the planet.”
如果共和党强制执行某种形式的政府支付排序，完全可能造成政府部分关闭的后果。 有些人将拿到欠款、有些人则不能。	As a result, a partial government shutdown is entirely possible, with the Republicans imposing a form of prioritization on government payments: some people will be paid what they are owed, and others will not.
可以理解，许多领导人（最著名的是德国总理安吉拉·默克尔）担心广泛的宏观经济刺激的长期后果。 这些担心是有根据的。	A number of leaders, most prominently German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are understandably worried about the longer-term consequences of aggressive macroeconomic stimulus.
受困国需要提高生产率，这一点是毫无疑问的，但在当前极端的紧缩和通缩气候下，要达到这一目标是不可能的任务，因为潜在或公开社会冲突相当激烈。	The need for higher productivity in the troubled countries is undeniable; but achieving it in the current climate of extreme austerity and deflation is unlikely, given an atmosphere of latent, or open, social conflict.
联合国大会是一次独一无二的机会，全世界领导人应该利用它来构建真正的全球福利 — — 更加健康的人民 — — 通过推动全民覆盖来消灭结核病、治疗NCD和促进更好的精神卫生实现。	The UN General Assembly is a unique opportunity for world leaders to foster a true global good – better health for their citizens – by advancing universal coverage to end TB, beat NCDs, and promote better mental health.
纽黑文－在我们揣摩中国5860亿美元经济刺激计划的含义时，思考中国为什么每次在需要促进经济增长的时候，都选择基础设施建设、房屋以及大项目，是很有趣的。	NEW HAVEN – As we digest the implications of China’s $586 billion stimulus plan, it is intriguing to ponder why China chooses infrastructure, buildings, and big projects every time growth needs a boost.
按照社会学家的分类，女性领导人可以归为两类：蜂后型，不太可能帮助其他女性晋升；以及正义女神型，将把其他女性的晋升列为重点。	According to sociologists, female leaders are of two schools: Queen Bees, who are less likely to help other women advance, and Righteous Women, who make the advancement of other women a priority.
抑制性的一刀切时监管或许是复杂而不可预测的金融市场的必须，但农村社会与此关系不大，更糟糕的是，这可能扼杀促进金融包容的努力。	Oppressive, blanket regulation, which may be necessary in complex and unpredictable financial markets, may not be relevant in a rural community – or, worse, it may stifle efforts to promote financial inclusion.
正像东盟不能也不愿对抗中国对南海的侵略一样，欧盟已经觉察到用软实力和以共识为基础的方法来抗拒俄罗斯有很多不尽人意之处。	And, just as ASEAN has been unable and unwilling to stand up to China over its encroachment in the South China Sea, the EU is already discovering the limits of its soft-power, consensus-driven approach to Russia.
在博取西方领导人信任并眼看苏联在东欧的帝国解体之后，他在1990年辞职，声称俄罗斯在戈尔巴乔夫领导下已重新回到独裁政府。	Having gained the trust of Western leaders and overseen the dismantling of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe, he then resigned in 1990, declaring that Russia – under Gorbachev – was returning to dictatorship.
如果教育投资回报继续下降，那么维持学生贷款将挤出其他消费和投资项，特别是在学生贷款拥有很高的资本结构地位的情况下。	If the return on investment in education continues to decline, the servicing of student loans will tend to crowd out other consumption and investment outlays, especially given that student debt has considerable seniority in the capital structure.
但是，尽管恐怖和饥馑已不复存在，但许多过去的镇压手段在普京的暴政下 — — 目前正处于第14年 — — 卷土重来。	But, while terror and famine have been absent, many of the oppressive tactics of the past have been revived under Vladimir Putin’s misrule, now in its 14th year.
但是，你无法摆脱一种不安感，即，当一切都说到做尽时，最新的科技创新对长期生活水平增长的贡献可能远远不如拥趸所宣称的。	Still, one cannot avoid the uneasy feeling that, when all is said and done, the contribution of recent technological innovations to long-term growth in living standards may be substantially less than the enthusiasts claim.
发自拉马拉 — — 美国应当停止重启巴以和平进程的努力，而这样做或许是实现和平的最佳方式 — — 一个反映了和平进程与实现真正和平之间巨大鸿沟的矛盾困境。	RAMALLAH – The United States should stop pushing for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. Doing so might be the best way to achieve peace – a paradox that reflects the huge gap between a peace process and achieving genuine peace.
根据经合组织的最新数据，2016年各国对非洲中小学教育的援助总额仅为13亿美元，须知美国五角大楼的预算大约是每天20亿美元。	According to the most recent OECD data, total donor aid for primary and secondary education in Africa amounted to just $1.3 billion in 2016. To put that figure in perspective, the US Pentagon budget is roughly $2 billion per day.
2005年上一次购买力平价计算时，所使用的方法是选取15个最贫困国家的国家贫困线，计算它们的平均值作为全球贫困线。	In 2005, when the previous round of purchasing power parities was estimated, the method used was to take the national poverty lines of the 15 poorest countries, compute their average, and treat that as the global line.
布达佩斯 — — 6月17日的希腊议会重新选举不过是自20世纪60年代以来困扰西方民主和开放社会的严重危机的最新症状而已。	BUDAPEST – The re-run of the Greek parliamentary election on June 17 is only the latest symptom of the most serious crisis to plague Western democracies and open societies since the 1960’s.
美国平均寿命预期增长速度不及欧洲，部分原因在于1999年以来许多中年美国白人寿命缩短，而这是与生活方式有关的疾病、类鸦片药物使用过量和自杀造成的。	Average US life expectancy has increased more slowly than in Europe partly because many white middle-aged Americans have, since 1999, been living shorter lives, owing to lifestyle-related diseases, opioid overdoses, and suicides.
自从中国在2005年7月实施汇率调控机制改革以来，人民币兑美国升值了32 % ， 并在去除通胀因素后对一揽子货币升值了约30 % 。	Since China reformed its exchange-rate regime in July 2005, the renminbi has risen 32% relative to the dollar and about 30% in inflation-adjusted terms against a broad basket of currencies.
特别是在赫尔穆特·科尔（Helmut Kohl）总理带领下的德国通常将货币一体化与政治联盟的目的联系在一起。	In particular, Germany under Chancellor Helmut Kohl often linked monetary integration with the objective of political union.
如果我们把这一预测外推 — — 没有迹象表明美国会回到2008年之前的增长路径上去 — — 股票收益实际年折现率按6%计算，那么未来成本将是人均150,000美元。	If we project that forward – with nothing visible to restore the US to its pre-2008 growth path – at the annual real discount rate of 6% that we apply to equity earnings, the future costs are $150,000 per capita.
如果土耳其不再向欧洲靠近，那么欧盟关于它在世界政治中成功���运用了“软实力”的说法必将被大打折扣。	If Turkey pulls away from Europe, the EU’s claim that it successfully wields “soft power” in world politics will be powerfully undermined.
不消说，西非地区有很多人感觉到我们就像是实验室中的老鼠，被用在了一场可能摧毁非洲农户养活自己和社区的能力的实验中。	Needless to say, many of us in the region feel as though we are being used as lab rats in an experiment that could devastate African farming families’ capacity to feed themselves and their communities.
它旗下的站点 — — 其中六个由比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会出资，前三年提供730万美元初始资金 — — 刚刚建立。	The sites – six of which are being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through an initial $73 million grant for the first three years – are just being established.
此类众议院席位很容易在2018年倒向民主党人，如果敏这样的候选人可以说服选民沃尔特斯并未倾听民意 — — 而且与特朗普过于亲密。	This kind of House seat can easily flip to the Democrats in 2018, if a candidate like Min can persuade voters that Walters is out of touch – and too close to Trump.
旨在增加经济体灵活性的改革总是艰难的 — — 在增长疲软的时期更是如此 — — 因为这需要消除既得利益的短期保护以换取长期繁荣。	Reforms aimed at increasing an economy's flexibility are always hard – and even more so at a time of weak growth – because they require eliminating protections for vested interests in the short term for the sake of greater long-term prosperity.
四年来，我一直指出，我们的商业周期问题需要更积极的货币和财政扩张政策，只有采取这样的政策，我们最大的问题才能较快地解决。	I have been arguing for four years that our business-cycle problems call for more aggressively expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and that our biggest problems would quickly melt away were such policies to be adopted.
一项此类挑战 — — 梵蒂冈银行 — — 不下于奥吉厄斯的牛棚（Augean stables ） 。	One such challenge, the Vatican Bank, is equivalent to cleaning up the Augean stables.
没错，哈马斯最近似乎正考虑接受一个基于1967年边界划分的解决方案，但该组织的领袖和成员能否容忍这个方案都令人存疑。	True, Hamas has been indicating recently a readiness to contemplate a solution based on the 1967 borders, but it is doubtful that its leaders and members could live with the betrayal of the refugees.
这种失败并不意味着世界多数民众在这些问题上没有共同点，也不意味着他们无法做出及时、甚至是勇敢的决策。	These failures do not mean that most people around the world do not see eye-to-eye on these issues, or that they are unprepared to make timely, even courageous, decisions.
这一方针在经济政策上的应用很快就来了。 特朗普新闻秘书西恩·斯派塞（Sean Spicer）拒绝透露失业率是多少 — — 从而回避要求他说出实际数字的问题。	The first application of this approach to economic policy came quickly, when Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, refused to say what the unemployment rate is – dodging a question that would have required him to state the actual number.
纽约—如果发达和发展中国家的国家专利体系能够整合入贸易体系，将带来更大的投资者专业化，并随之产生更快的技术创新和生产率增长。	NEW YORK – If developed and developing countries’ national patent systems were integrated into the trade system, the result would be greater specialization among inventors and, with it, faster technological invention and productivity growth.
比如，2009年，一名叫谢尔盖·马格尼茨基（Sergei Magnitsky）的律师在揭露俄罗斯官员的退税欺诈后被控盗用公款。	In 2009, for example, Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer, was accused of embezzlement after uncovering a fraudulent tax-refund scheme run by Russian officials.
货币政策 — — 特别是最近几年被央行采用的开足马力印钞的“量化宽松”计划 — — 也已经没有了空间，物价通胀正在抬头，央行资产负债表规模也达到了创纪录的水平。	Monetary policy – in particular, the vast money-printing “quantitative easing” programs pursued by central banks in recent years – has run out of space, too, with price inflation ticking up and central-bank balance sheets a record size.
这就意味着抵制难以计数的从产业游说团体到工会乃至地位稳固的官僚组织等利益集团。 目前为止，它们成功地保护了它们的既得利益。	That means facing down the myriad interest groups – from industry lobbies to trade unions and entrenched bureaucracies – that have (so far) successfully protected their turfs.
目前，最佳前景似乎是罗马历史学家塔西佗所描述的 — — “他们制造了一片沙漠，他们管它叫和平 。 ”	At the moment, the best outlook appears to be that described by the Roman historian Tacitus – “they make a desert, they call it peace.”
实际上，欧洲国家的宗教背景清楚地反映在有关这种研究的不同的欧洲国家的法律之中。 英国和瑞典最为开明，而意大利、奥地利和波兰最为限制。	Indeed, the religious background of Europe’s nations clearly manifested itself in various European laws on such research, with the United Kingdom and Sweden being the most liberal and Italy, Austria, and Poland the most restrictive.
也许弗拉斯贝克对DiEM25的激进泛欧洲主义最严厉的批评是它指责DiEM25在兜售左翼TINA ： “ 没有替代方案”可以运作于欧盟层面。	Perhaps Flassbeck’s harshest criticism of DiEM25’s radical pan-Europeanism is the charge that we are peddling left-wing TINA: “there is no alternative” to operating at the level of the EU.
许多人在提到巴塞尔银行监督委员会（Basel Committee on Banking Supervision）做恍然状，表示认识这个为银行规定资本标准的机构。	Many people show some spark of recognition at the mention of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which sets capital standards for banks.
马德里 — — 上个月巴黎大屠杀后刚刚达成的共识似乎是唯有依靠地面入侵才能打败伊斯兰国（ISIS ） 。	MADRID – The general consensus emerging since last month’s carnage in Paris seems to be that the Islamic State (ISIS) can be defeated only by a ground invasion of its “state.”
它们面临着这样的观点：美国货币联盟运转得比欧洲好得多，这是因为美国有一个大的联邦预算平滑不对称冲击（即针对个别州的冲击 ） 。	They are facing the argument that the United States’ monetary union works much better because there is a large federal budget to smooth the impact of asymmetric shocks – that is, shocks to individual states.
大多数决策者和专家都期望，在经过一段不可避免的艰苦转型期后，俄国将会在共同利益和价值的基础上与美国和欧洲一道构成战略和经济夥伴关系。	Most policymakers and experts expected that, after an inevitably troublesome period of transition, Russia would join the United States and Europe in a strategic and economic partnership, based on shared interests and values.

弗氏夫妇的小政府自由主义基本上便以这三个结论作为基础，故而从今天看也早已站不住脚，因为世界似乎并不赞同他们关于自己如何运转的结论。	Their case for small-government libertarianism rested largely on those claims, and has now largely crumbled, because the world, it turned out, disagreed with them about how it works.
2014年4月19日在美国无人机打击身亡的四位无辜平民之一的纳赛尔·穆罕默德·纳赛尔（Nasser Mohammed Nasser）的父亲哀痛地说 ： “ 我儿子以及和他一起死去的人和基地组织毫无瓜葛。 他们只是在讨生活的路上。	The testimonies of these individuals, vital for assessing the US drone program, are all too easy to overlook because these individuals are poor and have no political influence, and because the strikes are conducted in secret, far away from the US.
而右翼方面，希拉克对萨尔科奇的敌意会在一定阶段导致另一位候选人的出现，这个人可能是国防部长米谢勒·阿利奥·马里（Michele Alliot-Marie ） ， 也可能就是希拉克本人。	On the right, Chirac’s antagonism toward Sarkozy makes it that another candidate will appear at some point, either Michele Alliot-Marie, the defense minister, or Chirac himself.
科威特和阿曼虽然都是海湾合作委员会（还包括卡塔尔、巴林、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国）的成员，但却并未跟进沙特等国家的举措。	Kuwait and Oman have not followed suit, despite both being members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (which, in addition to Qatar, includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE).
防止卡扎菲重建在突尼斯和埃及已经倒塌的恐惧之墙是防止已经到来的“阿拉伯春天”继之以不满的严冬的关键因素。	Preventing Qaddafi from rebuilding the wall of fear that fell in Tunisia and Egypt is essential if the “Arab spring” is not to be succeeded by a new winter of discontent.
以古巴为靠山根本没有可能，因为劳尔·卡斯特罗正一心一意地幻想按中国式的一党资本主义模式重塑古巴已经垮掉的经济。	Cuba is out of the question as a patron, due to its preoccupation with Raúl Castro’s efforts to reshape its depleted economy in an improbable bid for Chinese-style capitalism in a one-party state.
十年来，我都在提议，未来的国际货币基金组织应该被看作是一个区域储备基金网络的顶点 — — 也就是说，一个在设计上和欧洲中央银行或者美国联邦储备系统相近的体系。	For a decade, I have proposed that the IMF of the future should be seen as the apex of a network of regional reserve funds – that is, a system closer in design to the European Central Bank or the United States Federal Reserve system.
但是作为一名生活在非洲大陆最重要的发展伙伴之一中国的肯尼亚人，我看到有一个衡量标准导致天平向津巴布韦倾斜：那就是这个国家与我第二故乡的关系。	But as a Kenyan living in China, one of the African continent’s most important development partners, I see one metric that tips the scale in Zimbabwe’s favor: its relationship with my adopted home.
结果，当货币市场基金可能无法充分偿付投资者的可能性升高时 — — 如2008年9月雷曼兄弟倒闭后 — — 地狱之门就打开了。	As a result, when the possibility arises that a money-market fund will be unable to pay investors in full – as happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 – all hell breaks loose.
在巴黎 ， 《 查理周刊》造就了民主自由的精神形式：写、画和出版任何东西的权利 — — 哪怕它们包括了极端的（有时是低俗的）挑衅。	In Paris, Charlie Hebdo has given form to the spirit of democratic freedom: the ability to write, draw, and publish anything – even extreme (and at times vulgar) provocations.
在美国以及其他地方，民选政府通常都会照顾好自己的人民，但如今，就跟那些背着顾客密谋打压“不守规矩”新竞争者的企业一样，政府自己都变成了一个独立的利益集团。	In the United States and elsewhere, elected governments used to take care of the people, but now, like companies colluding against their customers to keep out disruptive newcomers, they have become a separate interest group.
在一些政治家和商业领袖中，如果竞争被认为是不公平的，那么欧盟委员会就应该召集使用新的保护贸易的措施，这几乎成为他们的一种本能反应。	It is almost an instinct among some politicians and business leaders that if competition is deemed unfair, the European Commission should marshal new trade defenses.
但这些人的沙文主义行动却并未止步于此，因为他们还不断推动各种意图把北方意大利人（比如威尼托和伦巴第大区 ） ， 以及来自那不勒斯，卡拉布利亚以及西西里的南部意大利人进行区分对待的政策。	But their chauvinism does not stop there: they constantly propose measures to discriminate between northern Italian citizens from Veneto or Lombardy and southerners from Naples, Calabria, or Sicily.
盈利可能在相当长（但非无穷）的时间内以快于收入的速度增长，如果公司削减成本或降低投资的话 — — 这一趋势随着时间的延长可以降低折旧。	Earnings can grow faster than revenues for a prolonged (though not indefinite) period, if companies cut costs or reduce investment – a trend that would, over time, lower depreciation charges.
虽然马杜罗总统在大选之夜接受了失败，但其政府扬言将无视国民议会颁布的任何法律，并已另行委任不符合宪法规定的公社大会。	Although President Nicolás Maduro accepted defeat on election night, his government has promised to disregard any laws that the National Assembly enacts, and has appointed an alternative Assembly of the Communes not envisaged in the constitution.
6月8日，在G8峰会之前，英国将主办“为了增长的营养 ” （ Nutrition for Growth）峰会。	On June 8, just ahead of the G-8 Summit, the United Kingdom will convene a summit on Nutrition for Growth.
知识分子之所以自愿与埃尔多安及葛兰分子联盟是因为相信由军队控制国家机构 — — “军事监护 ” — —是土耳其民主制度最大的威胁。	What made these intellectuals willing allies of Erdoğan and the Gülenists was their view that the military’s control of state institutions – “military tutelage” – posed the greatest obstacle to democracy in Turkey.
过去几年里，世界对于美国巨大的经常项目赤字和财政赤字，以及试图让中国允许人民币更为自由地针对美元浮动而忧心忡忡。	Much of the concern over the past few years has centered on America’s yawning current account and fiscal deficits, and its effort to get China to let the yuan float more freely against the dollar.
1991年以来，好莱坞在许多电影中表现出美国人对后苏联时代俄罗斯的不信任你 — — 如《圣徒 》 （ The Saint ） 、 《空军一号 》 （ Airforce One ） 、 2006年的《黄金罗盘 》 （ The Golden Compass ） 、 《特工绍特 》 （ Salt）和《十一月杀手 》 （ The November Man）等。	Since 1991, Hollywood has documented American mistrust of post-Soviet Russia in a series of films – for example, The Saint, Air Force One, The Golden Compass of 2006, Salt, and The November Man.
她说“在胚胎植入前诊断不起作用且严重影响婴儿的风险高到或许值得尝试新技术的情况下，不愿使用捐献卵母细胞（卵子）的家庭少之又少 。 ”	She says, “There are very few families who don’t want to use donated oocytes (eggs), where PGD would not work, and where the risk of having severely affected babies is so high that it might be worth trying the new techniques.”
十多年的经济衰退导致公共债务不可持续，并正在促使更多移民向美国大陆流动，从而影响到成千上万家庭的生活并加重了留在岛上民众的负担。	More than a decade of recession has made the public debt unsustainable and is fueling migration outflows to the United States mainland, affecting the lives of thousands of families and imposing a higher burden on those who stay.
他甚至称气候变化是一个“骗局 ” ， 是中国人的发明，并以破坏美国制造业竞争力为目标（虽然他后来收回了这一指控 ） 。	He once even called climate change a “hoax,” invented by the Chinese to make US manufacturing less competitive (though he later walked back that accusation).
它不允许大范围的全面破产，在这类破产中，倒闭的业务将在法院保护下关闭，有盈利能力的业务将被出售，债务将围绕公司资产负债表进行重组。	It would not allow broad-spectrum, full-scale bankruptcies, in which failing operations are closed under the court’s aegis, viable operations are sold, and debts are restructured up and down a company’s balance sheet.
除了人员外，印尼的偏远卫生设施缺乏足够的配套基础设施：洁净水，卫生用品，可靠的电力以及基础医药和设备。	Beyond personnel, remote health facilities in Indonesia lack adequate supporting infrastructure: clean water, sanitation, reliable electricity, and basic medicine and equipment.
但是，同样重要的是总统奥巴马对科罗拉多州和华盛顿州投票的反应 — — 在总统连任竞选过程中，奥巴马在这两个州中轻松获胜。	Just as important, however, was President Barack Obama’s reaction to the Colorado and Washington votes – both states that he won easily in his re-election bid.
第二个目标是就2015年各国做出国家承诺的条款达成一致 — — 正式的名称叫做“国家自定贡献预案 ” （ INDC ） 。	The second goal was to agree on the terms under which countries will devise their national commitments – officially, their “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDCs) – in 2015.
事实上，只有民主国家联合起来，才能确保这个全世界经济最有活力地区的基于规则的强大秩序和稳定的实力平衡。	In fact, only an alliance of democracies can ensure the emergence of a strong rules-based order and a stable balance of power in the world’s most economically dynamic region.
现代共和党守护神罗纳德·里根曾说与其说政府解决问题，还不如说是它问题的制造者，这样的宣言体现了从那以后成为共和党烙印的基本的反政府态度。	Ronald Reagan, the modern-day GOP’s patron saint, once said that government is the problem, not the solution, a dictum that embodied the anti-government animus that has defined the party ever since.
所有发达国家中的股东在1945年至1975年和1980年期间没有什么组织并且并不积极。 在过去二十多年，他们以养老基金、投资基金以及对冲基金的形式重新确立自己。	For more than two decades, shareholders in all the developed countries, unorganized and passive from 1945 until 1975-1980, have recast themselves in the form of pension funds, investment funds, and hedge funds.
目前主要靠燃烧煤炭和天然气来发电；这些热电企业需要被逐步淘汰，并以利用太阳能、风能、水电、核能以及其他非碳能源发电的电力企业来实现替代。	Today’s electricity is largely generated by burning coal and natural gas; these thermal power plants need to be phased out and replaced by electricity generated by solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, and other non-carbon sources.
正如布雷顿森林框架在二战后重建了国际经济秩序，以真正的国际货币为基础的新的货币安排能够强化当前所急需的经济和金融稳定。	Just as the Bretton Woods framework restored order to the global economy after WWII, a new monetary framework, underpinned by a truly international currency, could strengthen much-needed economic and financial stability.
虽然也有人谈论，其中甚至不乏某些共和党人，任命一个专门委员会或一位特别检察官来调查有关俄罗斯和特朗普竞选的指控，但与1973年相比，这一调查却遭遇了非同寻常的阻力	Although there has been talk, even from some Republicans, about appointing a select committee or a special prosecutor to look into the allegations about the Russians and the Trump campaign, the resistance has been extraordinary compared to 1973.
民众们充满自信，执政者们小心谨慎：民主制度和真正的自由终于迎来了精神上的春天，它们再也不会在我们的故乡上消失了。	Self-confidence among the governed and caution among the rulers: these are the psychological springs of democracy and true freedom, and they can never again be diverted in our homeland.
葛兰素史克曾表示Mosquirix的供应将“不以盈利为目的 ” ； 但制药公司仍然必须做到收支平衡。	GSK has said that Mosquirix will be offered “not for profit”; but the pharmaceutical company still must break even.
她们写道 ： “ 有大量的证据表明发展中国家低技能劳动者的状况总体并未改善，或至少并未获得与高技能高教育水平劳动者同样的改善 。 ”	“There is overwhelming evidence,” they write, “that less-skilled workers in developing countries “are generally not better off, at least not relative to workers with higher skill or education levels.”
政府的一些改革派希望更多采取德国式的学徒制；也有言论认为应该为小企业提供税收优惠，或者放松过度限制的监管。	Some reformers in government want more German-style apprenticeship schemes; there is talk of tax breaks for small businesses, and of easing excessively intrusive regulatory burdens.
希特勒对希特勒青年的描述简洁概括了男子汉的理想 ： “ 像赛狗一样快、像皮革一样韧，像克虏伯钢铁一样坚强 。 ”	Hitler’s description of the Hitler Youth put the manly ideal succinctly: “Fast as greyhounds, tough as leather, and hard as Krupp steel.”
4月11日，G-7外长在广岛宣布“所有国家都不应该进行核试爆，所有国家都应该毫不迟疑地签署并批准CTBT ” ， 这是一个良好的开端。	The G-7 foreign ministers’ declaration on April 11 in Hiroshima – “No state should conduct a nuclear test explosion and all states should sign and ratify the CTBT without delay” – is a good start.
在平稳且渐进式发展的时代，宏观经济模型是政策制定者们的可靠工具，但绿色增长却不属于渐进式变革的范畴。	The macroeconomic models on which policymakers depend are solid tools in times of smooth and incremental evolution, but green growth is not about gradual change.
例如，皮肤细胞或者肝脏细胞只能复制更多的皮肤或者肝脏。 作为人类发育开端中最为活跃的细胞，干细胞是“主”细胞。	Whereas a skin cell or a liver cell, for instance, can reproduce only more skin or liver, stem cells, which are the most robust at the beginning of human development, are “master” cells.
同样，很多渔业经营者的潜在子嗣最终选择了其他职业，现在可以借此机会对他们手中的资源进行重组和整合，借此充分发挥规模经济优势。	Similarly, individually operated fishing businesses whose potential heirs ended up choosing other careers can now be reorganized and consolidated, thereby taking advantage of greater economies of scale.
至于难民自身，除了那些在首都贝鲁特街头流浪的之外，大部分都被困在难民营或临时收容社区，缺乏足够的医疗卫生和教育机会。	As for the refugees themselves, many are visible in the streets of Beirut, the capital, but most are stuck in camps or temporary host communities, and lack adequate access to health care and schooling.
在“过渡期间陷于停顿”是第三种可能的状况，倘若这种状况发生，利比亚将会陷入既非完全民主亦非独裁统治的“半自由”的“灰色地带 ” 。	Getting “stuck in transition” is a third possible scenario, with Libya remaining in a “gray zone” – neither a fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship, but “semi-free.”
该组织认为，资本账户自由化有利有弊，因此“自由化需要进行周密策划，制定时间表，并循序渐进以保证其利大于弊 ” 。	The IMF now recognizes that capital-account liberalization comes with risks as well as benefits, and that “liberalization needs to be well planned, timed, and sequenced in order to ensure that its benefits outweigh the costs.”
首先，未锚定的通胀预期和结构性困难可能意味着提振需求的努力几乎全部转化为价格的更快增长，而对提高就业毫无用处。	For starters, unanchored inflation expectations and structural difficulties might mean that efforts to boost demand show up almost entirely in faster price growth and only minimally in higher employment.
经济学家们总会饶有兴趣地观察到那些针对别国保护主义行为的反制措施就如同是说 ： “ 如果你朝自己的脚开枪，我也会这样做 。 ”	Economists are fond of observing that the argument for counter-measures against protectionism abroad is like saying: “If you shoot yourself in the foot, I will do the same.”
几十年来，巴西经济政策一直是背靠其巨大的国内市场优势制定的，通过复杂的补贴、税收和关税制度保护本地产业。	For decades, Brazil’s economic policy has drawn on the strength of its huge domestic market and protected local industries through a complex system of subsidies, taxes, and tariffs.
在这种情况下，经济学家眼中的坏事对世界经济而言却是件好事：我们面对的也许只是美国的金融衰退，而不是居高不下的长期利率和全球经济萧条。	In this case, what is bad for economists is good for the world economy: we may be facing a mere episode of financial distress in the US rather than sky-high long-term interest rates and a depression.
波士顿—在2月的亚的斯亚贝巴，非洲各国卫生部长签署了一份广受欢迎的宣言，承诺将免疫作为拯救非洲儿童免遭死亡和疾病的措施的核心。	BOSTON – In February in Addis Ababa, African health ministers signed a widely celebrated declaration of their commitment to keeping immunization at the forefront of efforts to save the continent’s children from death and disease.
尽管存在质疑者，但对亚投行的普遍支持表明收益大于风险，并且中国的措施有助于构建一个向所有人开放的网络。	While there are skeptics, broad support for the AIIB suggests that the benefits outweigh the risks, and that China’s initiatives may help build a network that is open to everyone.
最近，利比里亚在后冲突时代重建和人权发展方面取得了成功（此前该国经历了14年的内战 ） ， 因此是发展日程高级别小组会议的理想举办地。	Given Liberia’s recent success in post-conflict reconstruction and human development, following a 14-year civil war, it is a fitting setting for the Panel’s deliberations.
坎布里奇—下个月，美国财政部将按期向国会递交指明哪些国家（如有）通过操纵货币赢得不公平贸易优势的半年报告。	CAMBRIDGE – Next month, the US Department of the Treasury is due to submit to Congress its biannual report detailing which countries, if any, are manipulating their currencies to gain an unfair trade advantage.
我们不必“白手起家 ” ， 而是需要以国家层面的竞争当局的行业知识为基础，并在此过程中将有经验的人手纳入进来。	Rather than starting from scratch, we will need to build on national-level competition authorities’ institutional knowledge, and include experienced personnel in the process.
“里斯本战略”的成形在很大程度上要归功于奥地利经济学家Joseph Schumpeter，他的理念是利润源自创新。	The Lisbon Strategy owes much to the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, who claimed that profit results from innovation.
西方学者宣布西方价值观死亡完全正当，而中国或者穆斯林世界中就没有向尼采那样的人说他自己的上帝已经死了。	The Western scholar remains perfectly legitimate when putting to death Western values: there is no Chinese or Muslim Nietzsche claiming that his own God is dead.
公司表现也有所改善 — — 特别是受益于日元贬值的出口部门 — — 许多公司都报告了创纪录的盈利水平。	And corporate performance has improved – primarily in the export industries, which have benefited from a depreciated yen – with many companies posting their highest profits on record.
我们可以不选择分裂我们的身份，从而让多边全球问题难以处理；我们可以选择扩大我们的同情心和道德责任心的身份。	Instead of choosing identities that divide us, making it impossible to tackle multiplying global problems, we can shape identities that extend our sense of compassion and moral responsibility.
美国剑桥—一些批评家批评美国总统奥巴马竞选时口号颇具鼓动性（inspirational ） ， 还提出了“弯曲历史之弓”的雄心，当选后却表现得事务（transactional）而现实（pragmatic ） 。	CAMBRIDGE – Some critics complain that US President Barack Obama campaigned on inspirational rhetoric and an ambition to “bend the arc of history,” but then turned out to be a transactional and pragmatic leader once in office.
在拉丁美洲，阿根廷和墨西哥两国都在控制腐败和保持透明度的国家名单中排名垫底 — — 它们的排名比巴西要低得多。	In Latin America, Argentina and Mexico both rank among the bottom half of countries in controlling corruption and maintaining transparency – much lower than Brazil.
墨西哥黄豆、南亚香米、玻利维亚昆诺阿藜、亚马逊卡皮木、印度鹰嘴豆、秘鲁努纳豆、安第斯玛卡 — — 都曾经经历过掠夺性的知识产权诉求。	Mexican beans, South Asian basmati rice, Bolivian quinoa, Amazonian ayahuasca, Indian chickpeas, Peruvian nuña beans, Andean maca – all have been subject to predatory intellectual property claims.
虽然那些不上网的人也可以从那些在日常生活中暗中运行的应用程序中获益，例如智能信号灯可以帮助疏导交通流量，但却无法访问所有的智慧城市程序。	While offline populations can benefit from applications running in the background of daily life – such as intelligent signals that help with traffic flows – they will not have access to the full range of smart-city programs.
目前，七人的理事会已经出现两个空缺 — — 很快还会有更多空缺出现（主席和副主席任期都将在明年初到期 ） 。	There are currently two vacancies on the seven-member board – and more positions may open up soon (the terms of both the chair and vice chair expire early next year).
而主角的台词（当中所有的引用都是恰如其分的）也仍是那些不会揭穿美国在关于伊拉克和阿富汗问题上的利己主义外表的套话。	The characters’ lines (all quotes are approximate) are those that never pierce the bubble of American self-regard with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan.
因此她为那些身患恶疾且无法医治的有行为能力的成年人打开了接受协助死亡的大门，其执行条件与其他协助死亡合法化的国家和地区并没有太大的区别。	She thus opened the door for physician assistance in dying for any grievously and irremediably ill competent adult, under conditions not very different from those that apply in other jurisdictions where physician assistance in dying is legal.
中国的政治制度内含的一个关键障碍在于：虽然人们普遍认为民主对于充满活力的公民社会是不可或缺的，但是当局已经下定决心不以任何方式，形态或形式去引入选举民主。	One key obstacle lies in the Chinese political system. It is widely believed that democracy is indispensable for a dynamic civil society.
摩根士丹利分析师估算，2009年以来美国和欧洲银行被迫支付了2,300亿美元 — — 是FCA和解金的50多倍。	Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the top 22 banks in the United States and Europe have been forced to pay $230 billion since 2009 – more than 50 times the cost of the FCA settlement.
尽管具体的代际界限划分或多或少带有任意性，但它们反映了一个重要趋势：军事前线和民用后方分界日益模糊。	While particular generational delineations are somewhat arbitrary, they reflect an important trend: the blurring of the military front and the civilian rear.
除非债务国生产成本有所下降，否则增长就不可能复苏，而生产成本下降要么要求生产率的永久性大幅提高，要么要求真实工资下降，要么双管齐下。	Growth will not resume until production costs in the indebted countries decline, which requires either a substantial permanent increase in productivity, a reduction in real wages, or both.
相比之下，国家转型计划的实施将意味着与时间赛跑，需要顶住低油价、全球经济疲软和全球化后退等来自外部的压力。	The implementation of the NTP, by contrast, will be a race against time and a fight against the external headwinds of low oil prices, a weaker global economy, and retreat from globalization.
即使我们可以原谅布什将美国（以及世界大部分国家）拖入了没有对手的战争，原谅他在战争成本上的不诚实，他为战争融资的办法也找不到任何开脱的理由。	Even if Bush could be forgiven for taking America, and much of the rest of the world, to war on false pretenses, and for misrepresenting the cost of the venture, there is no excuse for how he chose to finance it.
虽然也不是没有可以挑毛病的地方（有人说新计划只是削减现有再培训计划资金的借口 ） ， 但数字平台可以大规模改善再教育和培训的想法是靠谱的。	While it is easy to be cynical (some say the new program is just an excuse to cut funds from existing retraining programs), the idea that digital platforms can massively improve re-education and training is a good one.
首先，美元之所以在选举后升值，唯一原因是特朗普承诺实施深度减税并增加支出解决美国基础设施陈旧的问题和提升美国据说“耗尽”的军力。	For starters, the dollar has shot up since the election only because Trump has promised to enact deep tax cuts and ramp up spending on decaying infrastructure and America’s supposedly “depleted” military.
洛杉矶 — — 前任总统乔治·W·布什不久前出版的回忆录披露2007年春他曾拒绝了以色列摧毁叙利亚秘密核反应堆的要求。	LOS ANGELES – Revelations in former President George W. Bush’s recently published memoirs show that he declined an Israeli request to destroy Syria’s secret nuclear reactor in the spring of 2007.
好像伊拉克国内的逊尼派-什叶派分裂问题还不够棘手似的，现在又出现了一个更深刻、甚至问题更大的裂痕 — — 土耳其与其自身身份和外部划定的边界的斗争。	As if the Sunni-Shia divide within Iraq were not difficult enough, a deeper and even more problematic fissure has now emerged – Turkey’s own struggles with its identity and its externally imposed borders.
接着，在去年8月，中国人民银行将人民币中间价调低1.9 % ， 这也许是为了回应IMF鼓励中国让人民币平价水平更接近市场汇率的报告。	Then, last August, the PBOC lowered the renminbi central parity rate by 1.9%, perhaps in response to an International Monetary Fund report encouraging China to align the parity rate more closely with the market rate.
而且随着中国共产党第十九次全国代表大会在今年晚些时候召开，中国主席习近平不愿被外界视为对美国的压力屈服。	And with the Communist Party of China’s 19th National Congress looming later this year, President Xi Jinping will not want to be perceived as giving in to US pressure.
在欧洲，疯牛病之所以让许多人震惊，不仅仅是因为它打破了牛肉作为一种安全健康食品的形象，而且因为人们知道了这种病的根源是给牛饲喂羊的脑浆和神经组织。	In Europe, mad cow disease shocked many people, not only because it shattered beef’s image as a safe and healthy food, but also because they learned that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep.
与此同时，建设和维护高速公路和运输体系的成本有了极大的增长，而能源效率的提高也降低了每英里汽油税收入。	Meanwhile, the costs of building and maintaining highway and transit systems have increased significantly, and rising fuel efficiency has reduced gasoline tax revenues per mile driven.
都已经是21世纪了，我们都把人送上月球再接回来了，却还没有能力让地球上的所有人都吃饱肚子，这怎么可以？	How can it be that in the twenty-first century, when we have taken men to the Moon and back, we still cannot feed everyone on this planet?
例如，位于中部的甘肃省与中国其他大多数地方一样正在应付结构性和社会问题，这些问题有的很棘手，有的难以克服。	For example, like much of the country, Gansu Province, at China’s geographical center, is grappling with structural and social problems that range from the daunting to the apparently insuperable.
对印度妇女来说，最大的交通障碍是规划者所谓的第一和最后一英里问题 — — 从家中/工作单位到车站的距离，阿莎对此有切肤之痛。	The biggest transportation roadblock for women in India lies in what planners call the first-last mile problem – getting to and from the station, a concern that Astha knows well.
最近 ， “ 哥本哈根共识”计划聚集了一些世界顶尖的经济学家来商议如何在这个资源有限的世界为我们这个星球贡献最大的利益。	Recently, the Copenhagen Consensus project gathered some of the world’s leading economists to decide how to do the most good for the planet in a world of finite resources.
这进一步证实了接触前预防（PrEP）技术的有效性，该技术旨在让艾滋病毒测试阴性者利用抗逆转录病毒药物保护自己远离感染威胁。	This is further evidence of the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a technique by which people who are HIV-negative use antiretroviral drugs to protect themselves from infection.
如果人们觉得受到威胁或相信某项事业的正确，国内的公众舆论会支持使用武力。 但美国对统治其它国家的兴趣的确微乎其微。	Domestic public opinion will support the use of force if people feel threatened or believe that the cause is just, but Americans have little interest in ruling over other nations.
凯恩斯相信应该执行激进的经济政策来对经济波动现象作出逆周期回应 — — 即在经济衰退期实施扩张政策，回升时实施紧缩政策。	Keynes is associated with a belief in activist economic policy aimed at ensuring counter-cyclical responses to economic fluctuations – expansionary policies during recessions and policy tightening during upswings.
影响的严重性取决于英国及其欧洲伙伴如何谈判棘手的分离问题，特别是自由贸易和金融畅通可以在多大程度上得到保留。	The severity of the effects will depend on how the UK and its European partners negotiate their tricky separation, particularly the extent to which free trade and financial passporting are upheld.
但是大多数美国人，尽管在布什第一任期内曾支持过减税（因为减税能让他们得到一点点额外的现金 ） ， 现在却不支持随后对基本政府服务的抨击。	But the majority of Americans, having supported the tax cuts in Bush’s first term because it gave them a little extra cash, do not support the attack on basic government services that has followed.
但是按照报告中的说法，穆巴拉克、他的夫人苏珊、以及他的两个儿子贾迈勒和阿莱，远远没有袖手旁观那么简单。	According to the report, however, Mubarak; his wife, Susan; and his two sons, Gamal and Alaa, are far from being mere bystanders.
但过去30年的研究表明真正的利他行为确实存在，而且可以超越亲属和社区，涵盖人类甚至是其他物种的普遍福祉。	But research over the past 30 years indicates that true altruism does exist and can extend beyond kin and community to encompass the welfare of humans generally – and that of other species.
事实上，尽管人们在ECT是治疗严重的抑郁障碍最有效的方法上有共识，但是，在治疗情绪障碍的大部分方法中，它是最后选择的方法。	In fact, despite a consensus that ECT is the most effective treatment for severe depressive disorder, it comes at the bottom of the list in most treatment regimens for mood disorders.
传统上，扩张被视为比常规欧盟条约更能超越国家利益的领域：入盟程序的常规内容要求决策方式更加社会导向。	Enlargement was traditionally viewed as an area where national interests would be more readily set aside than in conventional EU settings: the normative dimension of the process seemed to demand a more community-oriented approach to decision-making.
苏格兰也许会试图保持其自身货币与英镑的平价，但这需要比苏格兰中央银行所能拥有的更大的储备量，至少在一开始是如此。	Scotland might try to keep its currency at par with sterling, but this would require larger reserves than a Scottish central bank could command, at least at the outset.
很多领导人都并非传统的原教旨主义者，而是在全球化浪潮中被连根拔起并且在想象中的纯伊斯��哈里发团体中寻找生存意义的民众。	Many of the leaders are not traditional fundamentalists, but people whose identity has been uprooted by globalization and who are searching for meaning in the imagined community of a pure Islamic caliphate.
但如今市值最大的四家美国公司 — — 苹果、谷歌，微软和亚马逊 — — 都是科技企业（截至撰写本文时伯克希尔哈撒韦公司超越脸书排到了第五位 ） 。	But now, the four largest US firms by market capitalization – Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon – are all tech companies (as of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway had edged out Facebook for fifth place).
相反很多银行家走上了类似苏格兰英国皇家银行负责人弗雷德·古德温的道路，在古德温任职期间该银行积累了241亿英镑（合342亿美元）的亏损，但古德温自己却拿着巨额养老金退休。	Many bankers instead followed a path similar to Fred Goodwin, the head of Britain’s Royal Bank of Scotland, who racked up £24.1 billion ($34.2 billion) in losses, then resigned with a huge pension.
2017年11月，我所在大学的抗生素耐药性研究中心（CARe）举办了这一话题的首次大型研讨会，经济学、伦理学、法律、政策、社会科学和卫生等领域的著名学者齐聚一堂。	Then, in November 2017, the Centre for Antibiotic Resistance Research (CARe) at my own university held the first-ever major symposium on the topic, bringing together leading scholars in economics, ethics, law, policy, social science, and health care.
此外，依温特所言，如果他的团队的新技术能在明年面世的话，那就有可能制造出一种可以在24小时内生效的H1N1流感疫苗，再也不用等待几个月才能实现免疫。	And, according to Venter, if his team’s new technology had been available last year, it would have been possible to produce a vaccine to protect ourselves against H1N1 influenza in 24 hours, rather than several weeks.
在成为只不过是换上另一张标签的布什政府的延续的海报女郎时，佩林显示出她自己与贝隆夫人或者丹麦的反移民运动领袖柯丝高这些老于世故的伪民粹主义者有相当多的共同点。	In becoming the poster girl for a re-branded continuation of the Bush administration, Palin is showing herself to have much in common with glossy faux-populists like Eva Peron or Denmark’s anti-immigrant leader Pia Kjærsgaard.
东京 — — 2008年，美国国家情报委员会（NIC）发布2025年全球趋势，其中一个关键的预测是能源竞争将更加激烈。	TOKYO – In 2008, when the United States’ National Intelligence Council (NIC) published its volume Global Trends 2025, a key prediction was tighter energy competition.
被质疑进行国际干预的政府急切地渴望更加严格的全球规则以防止银行危机溢出国界，像亚洲流感一样传染给其他国家。	Governments that had been suspicious of international interference were eager for tougher global rules to prevent banking crises from spilling across borders and infecting others, like bouts of Asian flu.
这一回冲击来自欧洲。 肆虐欧洲的主权债务危机似乎要把小规模衰退变成一场大危机：希腊可能退出欧元区，这将在整个欧元区引发动荡蔓延。	This time it is from Europe, where a raging sovereign-debt crisis threatens to turn a mild recession into something far worse: a possible Greek exit from the euro, which could trigger contagion across the eurozone.
据萨默斯的说法，高储蓄导致了低增长；根据本文的另一种解释，首先是高增长 — — 及其不同的特征 — — 推动了高储蓄。	According to Summers, high savings caused weak growth; under the alternative explanation offered here, it was primarily rapid growth – and its distinctive features – that drove high savings.
然而对此的执法不力令国内企业在很大程度上忽视了这些成本，到了2008年当局开始大力纠察缴费率，让企业倍感压力。	Yet weak enforcement long meant that domestic firms largely ignored those costs. Then, in 2008, the authorities began to enforce the contribution rate vigorously, which squeezed firms.
上述言论值得我们留意，要知道出于公众对不受控移民的强烈反对而令英国脱欧公投“脱”派得胜也仅仅不过是两年前的事而已。	This is notable, considering that it has been only two years since a widespread public backlash against uncontrolled immigration delivered a victory to “Leave” in the Brexit referendum.
在过去，由于交易成本过高，即使中国制造的产品，其在中国的价格仍可能高于美国。 而电子支付对降低中国营商和交易成本非常关键，大大提高了零售业的效率。	E-payments are a key factor in lowering business and transaction costs in China, because they improve efficiency in the retail sector, where prices can still be higher than in the US even when the products are made in China.
否则，由于欧元区改革的政治和经济之间存在不可分割的联系，财政扩张将与货币决策者的努力一样对提振增长毫无效果。	Otherwise, given that the politics and economics of eurozone reform are inseparably linked, fiscal expansion could prove to be as ineffective as efforts by monetary policymakers to foster growth.
在欧元推出一年后的2000年，美国经济的规模仅比欧元区大13 ％ ； 到2016年已经拉大到26 ％ 。	In 2000, a year after the euro was introduced, the US economy was only 13% larger than the eurozone; by 2016 it was 26% larger.
一个例子是英格兰和苏格兰的《联合法案 》 （ Act of Union ） ， 该法案要求联合王国的所有后续君主宣誓维持苏格兰教会和英格兰教会。	One example is the Act of Union between England and Scotland, which requires all succeeding sovereigns of the United Kingdom to take an oath to maintain the Church of Scotland and the Church of England.
不过解决像华雷斯这样一座城市根深蒂固的社会和经济问题比派8，000名手持突击步枪的士兵占据这座小城的街道要困难得多。	Addressing the deep-seated social and economic problems of a city like Juárez, however, is a lot harder than flooding its streets with 8,000 soldiers carrying assault rifles.
考虑到欧洲议会与选民日常生活距离比较遥远，并且欧盟的官僚主义也饱受诟病，因此这一参与率水平以及朝向跨国政治的趋势是值得瞩目的。	Given the perceived remoteness of the European parliament and widespread frustration with the European Union’s bureaucracy, the level of participation and the movement toward transnational politics is remarkable.
当是时，人们担心东扩会制造欧盟内部冲突，因为来自中东欧的新成员国比较贫穷，其中有几个农业部门十分庞大。	At the time, it was feared that this eastern enlargement would create tensions within the EU because new members from Central and Eastern Europe were poor and some had large agricultural sectors.
早教具有显而易见的经济好处 — — 更不用说公民高涨的早教投资意愿了 — — 现在必须把目标定在找到有效方式并根据不同环境进行调整上。	Given the clear economic case for it – not to mention citizens’ demonstrated willingness to invest in it – the goal now must be to figure out what works and adapt it to different contexts.
1993—1994年，格林斯潘再一次勒紧货币政策，结果人们惊讶地发现，小规模紧缩可以给长期资产价格和公司借贷成本带来如此大的影响。	Between 1993 and 1994, Greenspan once again reined in monetary policy, only to be surprised by the impact that small amounts of tightening could have on the prices of long-term assets and companies’ borrowing costs.
因此，从某种程度上说，塔德里的巴基斯坦之行及其强烈的政治激进主义达到了目的：他增强了人民的对他们正在建设的制度的信念。	So, in a way, Qadri’s arrival in Pakistan and his intense political activism have served a purpose: he has reinforced the people’s faith in a system that they are continuing to build.
这是因为第一个要求偿还的债权人往往能收回全款，而其他人只能部分收回 — — 这也因此产生了一向激励因素，令所有债权人都一窝蜂地要求还债，即便借债人还没失去偿还能力。	This is because the first creditors to be paid would receive the full amount owed to them, leaving less for later creditors – and thus creating an incentive for all creditors to rush for the exits even before debt servicing had become impossible.
将军、外交官、国家安全官员和发展专业人士正在形成一个共识，要沿着叙利亚的一段边界设置禁飞的“安全区 ” 。	Generals, diplomats, national-security officials, and development professionals are approaching a consensus in favor of a no-fly “safe zone” along one of Syria’s borders.
世界银行的一份研究发现，营养不良所造成的成本最多相当于一个人一生潜在收入10 % ， 或一国GDP的3 % 。	A World Bank study found that under-nutrition can cost an individual up to 10% of his or her potential lifetime earnings, and as much as 3% of a country’s GDP.
而挪威和瑞士等其他国家的经常账户余额已超过本国GDP的10 % ， 但这些国家却拒不对货币进行增值。	Other countries, like Norway and Switzerland, are running current-account surpluses that exceed 10% of their GDP, but are resisting currency revaluation.
但我们或许也同样可以说使用人工甜味剂是“对我们味觉的扭曲 ” ， 而味觉则是为品尝可口的食物而存在的。	But we might just as well say that using artificial sweeteners is a “perversion of our sense of taste,” which exists so that we can detect nourishing food.
事实上，这些国家已经出现粮食和石油的相对价格的巨幅上扬、穷人的粮食危机和由商品价格上涨所引起的更高的通货膨胀。	Indeed, these countries are already experiencing large relative price increases for food and oil, a food emergency for the poor, and higher rates of inflation induced by commodity price shifts.
东方曾经惧怕自己无法从与西方的贸易中得到好处，因为后者有发达的基础设施和人力资本，而时至今日，西方开始害怕会从与东方的贸易中蒙受损失，因为后者劳动力资源廉价而丰富。	The East had feared that it could not gain from trade with the West, which had superior infrastructure and human capital; now, the West had come to fear that it would lose from trade with the East, which had abundant, cheap labor.
毕竟，亚洲地区没有哪个国家 — — 不管是日本、韩国、中国台湾、菲律宾这样的民主政体，还是中国和越南这样的一党执政国家，抑或文莱这样的微型君主国家 — — 可以在默许这类问题的情况下生存下去。	After all, no government in the region – whether a democracy like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines, a one-party state like China and Vietnam, or a tiny monarchy like Brunei – can acquiesce on such issues and hope to survive.
氢气（比如）可以通过升级生物燃料转换为液体燃料，也可以与废气中的二氧化碳反应或经过处理生产液体燃料用于运输。	The hydrogen could be converted into a liquid fuel by upgrading biofuels, for example, or it could be reacted with carbon dioxide from flue gas or otherwise processed to produce liquid fuels for use in transportation applications.
事实上，在拉托发出辞职公告前，国际货币基金组织宣布有权谴责那些实施可能对全球经济稳定造成破坏的干预政策的国家。	Indeed, a week before Rato’s resignation announcement, the Fund asserted that it had the right to censure countries whose intervention policies threaten to undermine global economic stability.
而当民粹主义者拥有起草新宪法的��会时，他们为什么不借此打击根据定义必然是由人民的敌人（常常被指责为外国势力的走狗）组成的反对派呢？	And when populists have an opportunity to write a new constitution, why should they not ride roughshod over any opposition, which, by definition, must comprise the enemies of the people (who often are accused of being foreign agents)?
还在把金融传染威胁视为王牌的希腊政客应该注意到希腊选举和欧洲央行的债券购买计划之间的巧合，并领会其中显而易见的联系。	Greek politicians who still see the threat of financial contagion as their trump card should note the coincidence of the Greek election and the ECB’s bond-buying program and draw the obvious conclusion.
2000年以来，中国与东盟十国的双边贸易额从320亿美元跃升至去年的3，500亿美元，增长了10倍，2015年甚至可能达到5，000亿美元。	Since 2000, bilateral trade between China and the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has grown tenfold, from $32 billion to $350 billion last year, and could reach $500 billion in 2015.
她在www.opendemocracy.net网站上汇报说，这一问题让戈尔措手不及，而且他也不支持这一观点。	The question, she reports on www.opendemocracy.net, seemed to take him by surprise, and he did not support the idea.
他们可以发挥实质性的领导作用，联合缅甸各政党、中国、印度、欧盟、俄罗斯和美国为缅甸的变革制定一份路线图。	They could play an essential leading role in a process including the Burmese parties, China, India, the European Union, Russia, and the United States that could devise a roadmap for change in Burma.
他发现，在正式部门，本地人工作岗位在难民涌入后事实上是增加的，这显然是拜难民流入对地区经济的刺激效应所赐。	He found that in the formal sector, jobs for locals actually increased after the influx of refugees, apparently because of the stimulative effect on the region’s economy.
如果当前趋势继续，到2030年 — — 即实现17个联合国可持续发展目标的时限 — — 英联邦国家70%以上的儿童的阅读和数学水平将存在缺失。	If current trends continue, by the year 2030 – the deadline for meeting the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals – more than 70% of children in Commonwealth countries will be failing reading and math.
政策中心的这一转移已有实际体现。 例如，奥巴马总统下令派遣2500名海军陆战队员到澳大利亚北部的某基地进行训练。	President Barack Obama’s decision to rotate 2,500 US Marines through a base in northern Australia is an early sign of that pivot.
事实上，关税从很多角度看属于昨天的问题 — — 至少曾经如此，直到特朗普把它们拿出来作为贸易战的武器之一。	Indeed, in many ways, tariffs are yesterday’s problem – at least they were, until Trump dusted them off as a weapon for his trade war.
有见及此，我们要求实现一个与经济寡头势力的腐蚀性影响脱钩的真正民主，同时呼吁那些认同这一共同目标的人们与我们一起行动起来，共同实现这一点 。 ”	We therefore demand true democracy, decoupled from the corrosive influence of concentrated economic power, and we call all who share in this common goal to stand with us and take action toward this end.”
买鸡蛋不就是毫无必要地造成了（或间接造成了）动物的受苦 — — 如果下蛋的母鸡生活悲惨，被囚禁在狭小的铁丝笼中的话？	Isn’t buying eggs from hens who have led a miserable life, jammed into small wire cages, needlessly causing, or being complicit in causing, the suffering of animals?
纳税人已经不堪重负了，居然还要看着，他们的钱被拿去支付银行家的天价奖金和红利 — — 据说这是为了确保银行能继续放贷，以促进经济复苏。	Already heavily burdened taxpayers saw their money – intended to help banks lend so that the economy could be revived – go to pay outsized bonuses and dividends.
其中的好处是日本和印度对叙利亚和平进程的兴趣可以刺激中国在签署、而非阻碍解决方案的达成方面发挥积极的作用。	A bonus here is that Japanese and Indian interest in the Syrian peace process could spur China to play an active role in reaching, rather than blocking, a solution.
但是，在1991年举行的议会选举中（此时距离这份宪法被采纳已逾两年 ） ， 胜出的依然是伊斯兰拯救阵线（Islamic Salvation Front ） 。	Yet, when parliamentary elections were held in 1991 – more than two years after the constitution was adopted – the Islamic Salvation Front still won.
凯恩斯主义者宣称“需求”主宰一切 — — 增加就业，从而提振投资乃至增长全靠需求 — — 这站不住脚。	Keynesians’ claim that “demand” is all-powerful – that it alone increases employment and thus investment and even growth – was groundless.
西班牙托雷多 - - 三个月前在安那波利斯开启的巴以和平会谈并不缺乏对于如何解决双方冲突的核心问题的想法。	TOLEDO, SPAIN – The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that began three months ago at Annapolis do not suffer from a lack of ideas about how to address the conflict’s core issues.
其实美国情报部门早就收集了许多关于基地组织的信息，但美国却没能把这些来自诸多情报部门的情报进行系统整理。	There was a good deal of information about Al Qaeda in the American intelligence system, but the US was unable to process coherently the information that its various agencies had gathered.
在了解市政资产的市场价值后，健全资产管理的下一步就是要了解城市从收入和资产价格上涨中获得的收益是什么量级的。	After accounting for the market value of municipal assets, the next step toward sound asset management is to understand the yield that a city earns from the revenue and rising market values of its assets.
吉拉尼在他的就职演说中明白地宣布打击恐怖主义是国家的首要任务，他的第一个决定就是释放被穆沙拉夫软禁的法官。	Gilani unequivocally declared in his inaugural address that fighting terrorism is a top priority, and his first decision was to release from house arrest judges deposed by Musharraf.
而由于发达国家和新兴市场都面临着严重的下行风险，修正走势可能只是2013年全球经济和金融市场糟糕表现的开端。	And, given the seriousness of the downside risks to growth in advanced and emerging economies alike, the correction could be a bellwether of worse to come for the global economy and financial markets in 2013.
迄今为止，中国对所有新情况的反应是毫不妥协，坚持与在军事上远逊于自己的东盟成员国在双边基础上解决领土争端。	So far, China’s reaction to all of this new activity has been to dig in its heels and insist on addressing its territorial disputes with ASEAN’s militarily inferior members on a bilateral basis.
不管是我们选择吃些什么，还是进行多少锻炼，或者评估身体遇到某种特殊状况的可能性，在数字上都可以真实而迅速的反应出来。	Whether we are choosing what to eat or how much to exercise, or trying to assess our chances of a specific condition, the numbers make it feel real and immediate.
一个大部分人仍然相信占星家的国家可以很好地欣赏一场由下得不是时候的倾盆大雨，一个准备不好的击球，一个不准的投球，或者接球手眼中的光线都可以改变比赛结果的体育运动。	A country where a majority of the population still consults astrologers can well appreciate a sport in which an ill-timed cloudburst, a badly prepared pitch, a lost toss, or the sun in the eyes of a fielder can transform a game’s outcome.
也许有人会反对说实施内部的重新安置无异于在迎合“种族或宗教清洗 ” 。 但是伊拉克长期战争的代价无疑会不管如何都会导致它的分割，是比这更糟糕的结果。	One may object that to facilitate internal relocation is to collaborate with “ethnic or religious cleansing”; but the toll of prolonged war in Iraq, which could lead to its dismemberment anyway, is much worse.
国际货币基金组织（IMF）预测2015和2016年增长率为3 % ， 对应通胀率分别为0.1%和1.5 % 。	The International Monetary Fund forecasts 3% annual growth in 2015 and 2016, accompanied by inflation rates of 0.1% and 1.5%, respectively.
一次大战的战败令德国陷入动荡，1919年的严酷和平、20年代的恶性通胀、30年代的大萧条，否则德国不会如此。	Germany was destabilized by defeat in World War I, a harsh peace in 1919, hyperinflation in the 1920's, and the Great Depression of the 1930's, but was otherwise not uniquely barbarous.
在美国，人们已经登录RateMDs.com和vitals.com等网站为自己的医生打分，HealthGrades.com还提供医生和医院的第三方评估。	In the United States, people are already rating their own doctors at sites such as RateMDs.com and vitals.com; third-party doctor and hospital ratings are available at HealthGrades.com.
我们也许会悲叹通过“外包”而失去的制造业岗位，但是我们肯定不会为我们出口到中国的巨量污染物感到悲叹。	While we may lament the loss of manufacturing jobs through “outsourcing,” we certainly do not lament exporting massive amounts of pollution to China.
大石油企业、大天然气企业、大煤炭企业需要接受气候变化责任，开始为适应做出真正的贡献，否则它们就必须准备好为自身的生存而战 — — 一场从长期看它们毫无胜算的战争。	Big Oil, Big Gas, and Big Coal need to accept responsibility for climate change and start making real contributions to adaptation, or prepare to battle for their own survival – a battle that, in the long term, they simply cannot win.
世界有足够的零碳能源用来推动整个全球经济的发展 — — 事实上，零碳能源可以推动的全球经济规模可以远大于今天。	The world has enough zero-carbon energy sources to power the entire global economy – indeed to power a global economy much larger than today’s.
唯一的希望是出现一场促使立刻行动的国际运动，比如像在哥本哈根会议前那样迫使世界最大碳排放国 — — 包括美国和中国 — — 给出排放目标。	The only hope is an international movement for immediate action, such as that which, in advance of the Copenhagen conference, compelled the world’s largest carbon emitters – including the United States and China – to set emissions targets.
而且，该政府鼓励波斯尼亚的塞族共和国民主进步党的领导人威胁就有关从依旧脆弱的波斯尼亚分离举行自己的全民公决。	Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia’s Republika Srpska to threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia.
戈尔和其他人经常争辩说如果气候变化研究能证明二氧化碳排放是有害的，那么人们就该停止排放 — — 而人们是有道义责任去这样做的。	Gore and others often argue that if the science of climate change concludes that CO2 emissions are harmful, it follows that we should stop those harmful emissions – and that we are morally obliged to do so.
他们资助伪科学、收买研究人员和批评家、转嫁责任、宣传政府弱监管，甚至将其产品销售给儿童（托尼虎是早餐麦片行业的领军企业，就像烟草行业的骆驼一样 ） 。	They funded shoddy science, co-opted researchers and critics, shifted blame, advocated for weaker government oversight, and even marketed their products to children (as with Tony the Tiger, breakfast cereal’s equivalent of Big Tobacco’s Joe Camel).
若是他们在与中国的激烈竞争中输掉了这块巨大的经济市场蛋糕，那将是一个致命的打击，因为纺织品出口通常来说是发展贸易过程中的第一步。	Losing this sector of the economy to the hyper-competitive Chinese will be a hard hit, as textile exports are often the first step on the development ladder.
但是，自大衰退以来，全球商业贸易增长陷入了停滞，主要原因是世界主要经济体需求萎靡和大宗商品价格暴跌。	Since the Great Recession, however, growth in global merchandise trade has stalled, mainly owing to anemic demand in the world’s major economies and plummeting commodity prices.
他的布道可以赢得整个足球场的听众并且获得诺贝尔和平奖，但是全世界的政治领导人却担心冒犯中国而回避与他公开会见。	His sermons fill football stadiums and he has won a Nobel Prize, but political leaders around the world shirk from meeting him openly, for fear of offending China.
但虽然俄国信息战在破坏方面的确取得了某种程度的成功并在某种程度上影响了2016年美国大选，但却未能创造出软实力。	But while Russian information warfare has been somewhat successful in terms of disruption, affecting the 2016 US election somewhat, it has failed in terms of generating soft power.
在此期间，美联储提出了一项到2022~2023年度前不去实现资产负债表正常化的策略，其运作时长比2000年代中期那个设计不佳的行动还要长2.5~3倍。	In the current period, the Fed has outlined a strategy that does not achieve balance-sheet normalization until 2022-2023 at the earliest – 2.5-3 times as long as the ill-designed campaign of the mid-2000s.
反对党国大党党员、卡纳塔克邦首席部长最近宣布他要吃牛肉，而执政党印度人民党的一位政客威胁说，如果他真的吃了牛肉，就要他的项上人头。	After the chief minister of Karnataka, a member of the opposition Congress party, recently declared that he would eat beef, a politician from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) threatened to behead him if he follows through.
这对于制定有效措施来应对结构性变化至关重要，特别是在处理经过40年高速增长和发展后产生的，包括腐败、不平等、与环境污染等，一系列经济与社会顽症的时候。	This is vital to enable an effective response to the structural problems – such as corruption, environmental pollution, and inequality – that more than two generations of rapid growth and development have brought.
这些国债可以在任何时候卖给欧洲央行，换取等额现金；但是，只要它们的收益率高于欧洲央行存款，银行持有国债就是有利可图的。	The T-bills could be sold to the ECB at any time, making them tantamount to cash; but, as long as they yield more than deposits with the ECB, the banks would find it advantageous to hold them.
事实上，他们探讨了特朗普取消离任总统巴拉克·奥巴马对俄制裁的可能性，奥巴马制裁俄罗斯是为惩罚该国干预美国大选的活动。	In fact, they had discussed the possibility of Trump lifting sanctions that outgoing President Barack Obama had imposed on Russia as punishment for its interference in the election.
SDSN动员来自学界、公民社会和私人部门的科学和技术专家支持地方、国家和全球层面的可持续发展问题解决方案。	The SDSN mobilizes scientific and technical expertise from academia, civil society, and the private sector in support of sustainable-development problem solving at local, national, and global scales.
如今，极端贫困主要集中在非洲；据世界银行2018年《贫困与共同繁荣 》 （ Poverty and Shared Prosperity）报告，全世界最穷的28个国家有27个在非洲，其中每个国家的贫困率都高于30 % 。	Today, extreme poverty is mostly contained to Africa; according to the World Bank’s 2018 Poverty and Shared Prosperity report, 27 of the world’s 28 poorest countries are on the continent, and each has a poverty rate above 30%.
事实上，在将美国力量事实驱逐出本地军事基地二十年后，菲律宾迎回了美国军队，以此作为新军事合作协议的一部分。	Indeed, two decades after essentially tossing US forces out of local bases, the Philippines has welcomed back American troops as part of a new military cooperation deal.
据一些媒体的报道，为了保证中国同意在APEC峰会期间参加悔悟，安倍甚至愿意承认日本对钓鱼岛的主张是有争议的。	According to some media reports, in order to secure China’s agreement to participate in a meeting during the APEC summit, Abe even agreed to acknowledge that Japan’s claim to the Senkaku Islands is disputed.
香港— 诸多最新评论警告中国债务激增，从2008年占GDP的148%增加到2015年三季度末的249 % 。	HONG KONG – A spate of recent commentary has been warning of the vertiginous rise in China’s debt, which jumped from 148% of GDP in 2007 to 249% at the end of the third quarter of 2015.
如IPCC这样的全球科学程序是至关重要的，因为它们在最大程度上给了我们期望，那就是在科学证据的基础上铸造共识。	Global scientific processes like the IPCC are critical, because they offer our best hope of forging a consensus based on the scientific evidence.
总的来说，越多人使用一种毒品，那么滥用者的数目也会随之增加（这是基于一种合理假设：全体吸食者中必定存在有特定比例的滥用者，其数量随总吸食者的增加而增加 ） 。	In general, the more people who use a drug, the larger the number of problem users there will be (on the reasonable assumption that problem users comprise a fixed proportion of all users).
我有一些担忧，以最近20年来的时间坐标轴来看，作为世界经济引擎的美国和中国，最近的经济增长明显有所放缓。	I have trouble seeing how the US and China, the main engines of global growth for two decades, can avoid settling on a notably lower average growth rate than they enjoyed before the crisis.
但是，如果有正确的方针 — — 以及一点点运气 — — 中国可以确保这一回的复苏将比过去更加可持续。	But, with the right approach – and a bit of good luck – it can make sure that, this time, it recovers more sustainably than in the past.
那些没有恢复选拔程序的大学，如布宜诺斯艾利斯大学，发现他们打造学术、商业和政治精英的能力被严重侵蚀。	Those that did not, such as the University of Buenos Aires, saw their role in shaping their countries’ academic, business, and political elites diminish.
但重要的私人医疗系统成本遏制变化，包括私人保险计划承担部分增加和收紧管理式保健（managed care）的控制，也是减速的原因。	But important cost-containing changes in the private health-care system, including more cost-sharing in private insurance plans and tighter controls in managed care, have also contributed to the slowdown.
阿富汗国家安全顾问兰金·达德法尔·斯潘塔称协议“为阿富汗安全奠定了坚实的基础，是地区发展的指导性纲领 。 ”	Afghanistan’s national security adviser, Rangin Dadfar Spanta, describes the pact as “providing a strong foundation for the security of Afghanistan, (and) a document for the development of the region.”
世界在扶贫和扩大饮用水普及面等方面取得了大量进展，但并没有在20世纪90年代趋势的基础上取得本可以实现的重大改善。	While the world made major gains in tackling hunger and expanding access to drinking water, it did not significantly improve upon what could have been expected relative to 1990s trends.
为了有效影响变化 — — 不仅仅是为了妇女 — — 我们需要对计划生育的支持、妇女和儿童卫生服务以及对赋权项目的支持。	To truly affect change – and not only for women – we need global support for access to family planning, women’s and children’s health services, and support for empowerment initiatives.
中欧大学现在已经跻身社会科学领域全球前一百名大学之列 — — 这对于学术领域的新加入者是一种令人惊叹的成就。	CEU now ranks among the top 100 universities in the world in the social sciences – a remarkable achievement for an academic newcomer.
例如，戈尔曾经发表著名的观点，那就是全世界的各大主要城市都将由于海平面巨幅上升六米（相当于二十英尺）而会被淹没。	Al Gore, for example, famously claimed that a whopping six meters (20 feet) of sea-level rise would flood major cities around the world.
有证据表明，在发生金融危机的情况下，如果政策无效 — — 比如因为名义利率已经位于零区间 — — 赤字支出可以起到不同寻常的稳定效果。	There is evidence that in the wake of a financial crisis, when monetary policy becomes ineffective – for example, because nominal interest rates are at the zero bound – deficit spending can have an unusually strong stabilizing impact.
在2018年的前九个月，世界已经经历了平生罕见的历史性天气事件 — — 从美国西部、希腊和瑞典因干旱导致的森林火灾到夏威夷、印度南部和南亚其他地方的洪水。	In the first nine months of 2018, the world has experienced a lifetime’s worth of “historic” weather events – from drought-fueled forest fires in the American West, Greece, and Sweden, to floods in Hawaii, southern India, and elsewhere in South Asia.
但一个反覆无常的政客一夜之间颠覆建立已久的结构和机制是非常困难的，如果这不是为了更加根本性的变化的话。	But it would be very difficult for an erratic politician suddenly to overturn long-established structures and mechanisms, were it not for a more fundamental economic shift.
此外，对于中国等快速发展的经济体，可再生能源部署完全没有取代化石燃料；相反，可再生能源构成了燃料供给约束，妨碍了更快的经济增长。	And, in the case of rapidly developing economies like China, renewable-energy deployment is not replacing fossil fuels at all; instead, renewables are supplementing a constrained fuel supply to facilitate faster economic growth.
几乎所有环境援助 — — 根据经合组织的数据，总量达到了215亿美元左右 — — 都被用在了气候变化上。	Almost all environmental aid – about $21.5 billion, according to the OECD – is spent on climate change.
当回顾2008年来我所撰写的文章时，我发现自己有时也急于推进个人最喜欢的方法，而不顾可能给其他方法造成的损失。	When I look back at everything I have written since 2008, I find that I, too, have sometimes been too ready to push my favorite recipes at the expense of others.
当选后，马克龙保持了其新鲜空气的名声，组建了一个由来自社会各界的年轻人组成的政府 — — 他们也许欠缺经验，但充满了热情和智慧。	After his election, Macron upheld his reputation as a breath of fresh air, building a government composed of young people from all walks of life – inexperienced, maybe, but enthusiastic and smart.
中国和印度在美国都有庞大的海外社区，中国为240万，印度为170万。 和其他美国人一样，他们对于各自的祖国越发关注。	Large expatriate communities in the US – 2.4 million Chinese and 1.7 million Indians – have increased interest in their home countries among other Americans.
中东地区的输家也非常明确：感觉生存受到威胁、开始将国内什叶派���数族裔视为伊朗第五纵队的沙特阿拉伯和其他海湾国家。	The losers in the region are also clear: Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states, which feel existentially threatened, and have come to regard their own Shia minorities as an Iranian fifth column.
法国社会党从来没有经历过天主教的现代化改革，也没有过巴特戈德斯贝格纲领（德国社民党曾在1959把它称为马克思主义的最后遗迹 ） 。	The French Socialist Party never had its “aggiornamento” or “Bad Godesberg” (where the German SPD in 1959 renounced its last vestiges of Marxism).
此外，尽管当时欧元区失业率正在下降，但仍接近10 % ， 1999年全年都高于今天的水平9.3 % 。	While unemployment in the eurozone was declining, the rate was close to 10%, and it remained higher than today’s level, 9.3%, for all of 1999.
此外，在一个相对高增长的经济体中，只要这些债务被用于资助投资，无论是产生高回报或创造了价值超过债务的资产，那么高债务水平显然并不一定是个问题。	Moreover, in a relatively high-growth economy, ostensibly high debt levels are not necessarily a problem, as long as that debt is being used to fund investments that either yield high returns or create assets worth more than the debt.
另一个主要担忧是，如果企业不再能够“走后门 ” — —即贿赂官员允许他们规避过度监管 — — 业绩将受到影响。	Another major concern is that, if businesses are no longer able to “grease the wheels” – that is, bribe officials to allow them to circumvent excessive regulations – their performance could suffer.
在全球领导人准备齐聚巴黎联合国气候变化会议之际，巴基斯坦正在大洪灾过后的一地狼藉中挣扎。 洪水摧毁了房屋，毁灭了庄稼，冲垮了大桥，还夺走238人的生命。	As world leaders prepare to meet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, the country is reeling from the aftereffects of devastating floods that damaged buildings, destroyed crops, swept away bridges, and killed 238 people.
该指数指的是人们在被问到 ： “ 如果道琼��指数明天下跌3 % ， 我认为后天道琼斯指数会：上涨？	The index is the share of people who answered “increase” to the question, “If the Dow dropped 3% tomorrow, I would guess that the day after tomorrow the Dow would: Increase?
目前，在美联储新主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）的领导下，政策可谓出色；但这并没有阻止特朗普公开抱怨利率升高过快。	So far, the Fed’s policies under its new chairman, Jerome Powell, have been spot on; but that hasn’t stopped Trump from publicly complaining that interest rates are rising too rapidly.
